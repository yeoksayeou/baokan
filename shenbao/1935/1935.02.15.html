<p>時評</p>
<h3>統一幣制之前</h3>
<p>— 貞</p>
<p>我國幣制複雜。不合法定標準。民國以來各地不同。易地不能通用之苦。一般人民身受已久。貧苦者遭受損失。工商業因是不能充分發展。每以匯水漲落不定。而遭意外虧折。整個國民經濟之疲敝。貨幣不統一。亦爲主要原因之一。</p>
<p>財部有鑒於此。謀逐漸改革。以期全國劃一。經甘末爾設計之後。復再三考查。及國內專家之研究。乃有鼓鑄五厘·一分·五分·一角·五角·等以十進位爲準則的輔幣之議。其輔幣券亦照此標凖發行。以期逐漸收回現行之銅幣銀角。此議果能順序推行。則貨幣劃一之效。不難收穫。惟目前各交通比較便利產業比較發達之都市。市面流通者固以銀元爲標準。而下層民衆。無論都市之小販。農村之手工業者。猶大都沿用銅元。在連僻區域。此風尤甚。是以收回雜幣。宜特別注意貨幣混雜之區。先加以適當之整理。然後推行法定幣制。方不致重蹈以前轍也。</p>
<p>我國國民所得。在總合數目當在不小。但分配而後。個人所得。其數甚微。以是購買力特低。一般物價。特別是日常生活必需品多數以銅元爲本位。故幣制改革。不可忽視國民所得與物價之平凖。否則法令與民間實生活相離太遠。必多捍格。與其發生障硬後再圖補救。多一紛更。不如事先籌劃預防。以免將來之困難。</p>
<p>目前爲改革幣制最大阻力者。厥爲各地方標凖貨幣未遵照法定準則發行正幣及輔助幣。如珠江流域之毫洋。朝夕之間。幣價不同。加以僞幣充斥。小民固不易辨別。商家又何嘗不感覺痛苦。如四川省區以內。即發生難於通行之苦。對省外匯兌。貼水之高。乃至百分之四十。大之足以障礙幣制之統一。小之足以遺害地方。使農工商交受其困。反映至於政治。遂生意外之惡果。又如魯豫晉諸省。銀幣本位尚不致有巨大差別。而輔助幣懸殊特甚。亦影響及於整個社會。蓋我國各中小城市。猶沿用銅幣本位。茍輔助幣之銅元之發生動搖。即　　於震撼市面足故推行本位貨幣之先須先使現在流通之劣幣歸於淘汰然後十進位輔幣得而推行合乎法定之貨幣不致受劣幣影響而陷藏。改革之數。庶可見矣。</p>
<p>抑有可注意者。我國不特爲速東之主要市塲。且爲先進各國共認爲世界最有望之市塲。其貨幣流通情狀。關係至鉅。吾人於改革幣制之前。原有考鏡各國現行幣制趨向之必要。溯自一九三一年英國首先發動減低貨幣金平價後。日本繼之。其餘諸國相繼倣傚。即存現金逾全世界所有金額三分一之美國。亦以國內外經濟壓迫。至減低金平價百分之四十至五十。而維持金本位制度之國。僅餘法比等少數國家。蓋減低貨幣價值之後。一則可以因通貨膨脹之故。剌激國內產業。換言之即提高物價。使各生產事業處於有利地位。轉換日就衰微之不景氣市面。英國借此以形成帝國內之經濟聯盟。日本因而發展其對外輸出貿易。在世界經濟恐慌期中各得一時期之局部穩定。二則因國際匯兌低落。而其出產品在國外市塲得有利地位。（貨價比值較低）有形輸出增加。無形輸入同其增大。於是工商業界同受其利。美國實行較遲。然亦得足相適應之效果。不過此種政策。以我國幣制之不健全。根本上尚談不到此耳。</p>

<p>［華盛頓］華盛頓今日自聞海軍大飛艇麥康號墮海之消息後、即宣稱、將分二次進行調查麥康號失事之原因云、此次出事地點、約離加州海岸十里、時在深夜共死二人、據稱海軍總長史璜生將統率海軍部人員、進行第一次調查、第一次調查竣事、即將繼之以國會調查、政府領袖稱、或將派遣若干國會議員前赴太平洋海岸調查麥康號出事原因、史璜生稱、二三日內即將組織海軍調查法庭、史氏今日與衆院海軍委員會主席文生氏舉行會議、歷時甚久、討論麥康號失事情形、史氏答覆海軍最後所造大飛艇之問題稱、關於大飛艇之未來、海軍部尚無決定、坦白言之、是否值得建造大飛艇、余實不知、但海軍現在之需要、更有甚於此者云、美國艦隊司令里夫斯大將發表聲明稱、遇救之八十一人或將在舊金山洋面之某戰艦上、陳述麥康號失事之經過云、根據海軍條例、則海軍法庭應由海軍軍官三人及中立者一人組成之、截至現在止、海軍及政府官員發表之文告、一致稱譽該飛船船長韋萊不止、（十四日國民電）</p>
<p>阿姆斯特丹　荷蘭航空公司經理樸辛對記者謂、麥康號雖然失事、然公司仍信飛艇實爲交通之利器、機氏對於愛克拉之見解頗表同情、愛氏宣稱、此等不幸之遭遇皆因氣候變化所致、例如德國飛船齊伯林號雖曾迭遇風暴、然固安然無恙也、故麥康號之失事亟應加以考察、故荷公司亦須加以調查、藉資借鏡云云、（十四日國民電）</p>

<p>［羅馬］數日來意阿兩國間之戰雲、今日似稍消散、兩國官塲竟日會議、顯已稍有結果、而使嚴重之局勢略見鬆動、意國外次蘇維區與阿國駐意代辦葉蘇斯會商之後、葉氏宣稱、「阿國軍隊向未侵入意屬索瑪里倫邊境、所有騷擾皆係游牧民族所爲、此等民族不屬阿國政府管理」云云、嗣蘇葉兩氏復表示希望兩國間之事件、無須流血即能解決、然同時兩國之備戰計劃、依舊進行、意軍三萬餘人仍在佛露稜薩及米蘭二處枕戈待發、首相墨索里尼且親自召集最高防務委員會、舉行會議、詳細討論阿國問題、阿國方面則政府宣佈希望國聯進行調解、當能避免戰爭、惟意圖要求向意族脫帽行禮及賠償五百萬元各節、礙難承認、茲悉兩國首都仍將舉行會議、以圖免除兩國之衡突云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］各國間現方積極進行外交談判、以謀解決意阿兩國之爭端、主要談判係在阿國京城舉行、由阿皇親與意國公使磋商、另一方面阿國駐意代辦葉蘇斯曾與外次蘇維區會晤、並由首相墨索里尼予以延見、蘇維區與葉蘇斯會晤時、曾申說意國所採取之軍事措置至目前止、僅爲預防性云、一般人相信此次爭端解決之方式、大約當在阿國與意屬東菲洲殖民地交界處、設置中立地帶、並由兩國會派混合委員會、以確定經過事件之責任、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>［羅馬］阿比西尼亞代辦今日下午、訪問意外次蘇維區氏、由蘇氏接見、晤談約一小時之久、關於談話內容以及談判之結果、並無正式新聞發佈、但自負責人方面所得消息、關於意阿間設立中立區域以防止事態益臻繁複之可能一事、至今尚無具體之諒解成立、惟意政界方面已一再聲明、意政府所願者不過爲和平解決、但阿皇是否有相當之威權、禁止部屬之刧掠殘殺、則尚屬一大疑問云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>西門報告下院</h3>
<p>兩軍保持原陣地</p>
<p>直接談判進行中</p>
<p>［倫敦］外相西門今日在下院發言、述意阿兩國爭案事、謂駐羅馬英大使曾悉意阿兵隊自在索瑪里倫邊界區域發生衝突後、意政府即在意國動員陸軍兩師共三萬人、英大使又悉意政府取此戒備計畫、非欲放棄與阿直接談判以得和平解決之努力、據最近消息、意軍既未由其在互爭區域內佔之陣綫前進一步、且命駐阿意使與阿政府談判、英政府亦命駐阿英使巴敦竭力斡旋、使此項談判得告成功、報載意圖已以哀的美敦書致阿一節、當局已予以否認、惟意政府於最近邊界事端發生後、即向阿政府提出抗議、並停留覓取賠償之權利、至於阿方則恪遵其一月十九日致國聯之公文、已嚴命前綫軍隊不得續釀事端云（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>對英法建議德國草就覆文</h3>
<p>待送達英法政府同時公布</p>
<p>［柏林］一般人現正盼待德國對於二月三日英法倫敦宣言書所提出之覆文、此項覆文、將於本星期四或星期五日由德國政府送交英法駐德大使、轉遞英法政府、覆文全稿已起草完竣、現正待希特勒總理核準、大約不至立即在柏林發表、必與英法兩國商定後、始乃同時公佈、覆文語氣大約甚爲妥恊、惟措辭則多空泛不切、蓋德國政府意欲避免兩種困難、故不得不含混共詞、一則他國人民均力圖團結以共謀和平、德國又欲令人發生消極不參加之印象、二則因各國政治局勢、殊多阢隍不穩之因素、德國頗欲避免受基本之約束、俾待時而動、德國政府對於英法俄諸國內政變化情形、極爲注意、最近意大利與阿比西尼亞之衝突、德國方面故示鎮定、宛若與德國漠不相關者、實則乃故意掩飾外國方面之耳目、蓋意大利既發生殖民地之衝突、不免減少其對於歐洲政治行動突、不免減少其對於歐洲政治行動之自由、明眼人自知之也、此外德國似欲曲解倫敦宣言書、以爲預先承認德國重整軍備之合法、且謂縱令倫敦宣主書並未立即承認德國重整軍備之合法、至少列強亦不再堅決反對、因此德國自可利用時機、得寸進尺、以獲得更優地位、蓋談判延宕愈久、則德國軍備亦愈見擴大也、此外尤足注意者、德國最佔勢力之人士、目前態度業已更進一步、國社黨中最有勢力之分子如國社黨外交局主任羅森培、極爲希特勒所他倚畀、現乃重提前副總理巴本之著名理論、主張歐洲各國聯合以征討蘇俄、希望此種主張、可獲得英國一部分人士之同情、由是可見德國有力分子實具有各種打算、其力量如何、殊難預測、惟在德國覆文送出之前夕、吾人固不妨一加以申述耳、（十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>政府辦理失業問題不力英工黨提彈劾</h3>

<h3>海道測量局輔助測量濬挖神灘四月初動工</h3>
<p>太挖泥船下月底抵滬</p>
<p>該船船員規定七十人</p>
<p>灘之位置屬銅沙閂沙</p>
<p>大通社云、濬浦總局向德國雪高造船公司訂造世界最大挖泥船一艘、已於本八日啟駛來華、估計行程、二個月即可抵滬、均誌報端、大通社記者、昨晨特再趨訪該局總工程師查得利博士、即悉該船已可於下月底邊抵滬、關於神灘測量等工作、胥已開始、茲誌其情如后、</p>
<p>灘名銅沙閂沙</p>
<p>關於濬挖吳淞口外神灘、以工程甚鉅、故於測量等工作、由海軍部海道測量局、予以輔助、茲已測量完畢、該灘位置、實在神灘之東南面、其地名爲銅沙閂沙、適當揚子江入海口之中心、距離揚子江口爲二十英哩、距離吳淞口爲三十英里、測量局於測量完後、已繪印詳細地圖、以備濬浦局於該項濬浦工程開始時之參考、</p>
<p>船員定七十人</p>
<p>至昨晨報載哈瓦斯社關於該大挖泥船啟駛來華之電訊、查氏謂略有出入之處、緣該船船員方面、迨其抵滬後、於雪高造船公司所派來船員、仍擬留用四五人、以資熟手、並非全用華人、惟除此四五人外、規定船員名額爲七十人、其餘之六十餘人、則悉由華人派充耳云、又每日能挖沙石泥土量、約爲二萬立方公尺、亦非二萬五千立方公尺云、　　　四月初上開濬</p>
<p>該大挖泥船、計程於下月底邊當可抵滬、故濬挖吳淞口外銅沙閂沙工程、大致於四月初即可開始、該處泥質、據查氏研究結果、殊與黃浦江內之泥質無異、惟稍滑耳、惟規定灘挖長度、爲二十英哩、關度僅一千呎已足、前謂尚擬挖闊至二十英哩、乃記者之誤聽云、</p>

<p>來滬任務</p>
<p>據馬氏談、滇省因交通之不便、僻處一隅、商業受其影響、殊少發展、以致外貨充斥市塲、九一八前、日貨在滇市塲、幾成獨霸之勢、此後因抵貨運動關係、日貨減少、但因地昆安南、故法貨取日貨而代之、此種現象、殊爲可慮、實業廳爰有舉辦國貨展覽及國貨公司之舉、以便發展國貨市塲、挽回漏巵、至世界經濟不景氣、因滇僻處一角、故商業上所受影響尚少、</p>
<p>定期返滇</p>
<p>滇省實業尚處於極幼稚之手工業時代、僅夠自給、敎育方面、全省有大學一所、中學十餘所、小學七八十所、但民衆敎育極爲發達、此乃一特殊而良好現象、本人此來、爲接洽雲南國貨展覽會及國貨公司徵集貨品事、業與中華國貨產銷合作恊會訂立辦法、現參加貨品、前已起運、現已到達昆明、本人定本月二十日離滬、以便參加該會開幕禮云、</p>

<h3>捲菸業公會條陳救濟捲菸業辦法</h3>
<p>昨呈稅署轉請財部採納</p>
<p>本市華商捲菸廠業同業公會、以我國捲菸事業、日趨衰頹、昨特呈請稅務署轉呈財部條陳救濟辦法、請求採納施行、原文如下、逕啓者、案查捲菸事業、自民國十九年十月一日起、至二十年三月底止、在統稅區域範圍內機製捲菸以每月完納稅項、計平均銷數爲一零二四零八箱（五萬枝箱）自二十一年一月捲菸</p>
<p>稅率增高</p>
<p>而其每月平均數目、至二十二年十二月底止、降至九零四五箱、（五萬枝箱）二十二年十二月五日、至二十三年十月之問稅率、復行增加、而其數目、乃一落而爲七八三五八箱、（五萬枝箱）上述衰落情形、其一部份原因、係出於營業上之環境、如市面經濟之不景氣、及銅元跌價等等、皆足以使一般人民之購買力減退、然此不過間接之原因耳、其匪接之要點、乃如下述、（一）機製捲菸稅率、與手製捲菸稅率、距離太遠、（二）手製捲菸稅區城內製銷之發展、（三）手製捲菸發展之原因、因政府徵收手製捲菸稅項、不分等級、每五萬枝、平均收稅十元、此項稅率、僅及機製捲菸最低稅率八分之一、其漏稅無法杜止、私菸銷路日廣、機製菸、</p>
<p>營業衰落</p>
<p>之至大原因也、當十九年限制手製捲菸條例頒布時、乎製捲菸之營業、僅限安徽之蚌埠、河南之許州等處、鄉僻之小鎮、但現時則安徽·河南·山東·河北·江西·各省、及其他諸省之鄉鎮、遍處皆有、略計手製捲菸、每日平均銷數、約有二萬餘箱）五萬枝箱）以稅收方面言之、機製菸商、既因手製捲菸之發達、受鉅大之損失、而政府於手製捲菸所收之稅欵、實等於零、以吾人經騐觀之、現行捲菸稅率條例、確能使手製捲菸事業之發展、不但是也、手製捲菸、每假冒機製捲菸之註冊商標、</p>
<p>競爭銷路</p>
<p>近日尤甚、而現行法律、對於僞造仿造商標之懲罰及保護註冊商標之辦法、實際上不足以禁止此種之行爲、爲救濟機製捲菸事業、及維持政府之稅收起見、謹將管見所及、條例如下、（一）增加手製捲菸稅率、與機製者宦這最低稅率相等、或頒行一種單行法、除合法登記之廠商外、不準製造捲菸、並須嚴格執行、及對於僞造之商標、加以懲罰、至對於上列手製捲菸區域、尤宜特別注意、（二）對於限制進口捲菸用紙條例、定一嚴厲施行辦法、使一切違法漏稅之捲菸、無從製造、（三）對於菸葉統稅之徵收機關、嚴厲監察、勿使漏稅菸葉、充斥各處、爲手製捲菸者所利用、（四）擴大捲菸緝私委員會之權力、使其對於緝私方面、得以充分執行、如最近河南·鄭州·一帶二十三年茺菸葉稅、與二十二年兩相比較、已可增加百分之三十、上述各點、及其救濟方法、唯希貴署審核、轉呈財政部採用施行、俾舒商艱、而裕稅收、至紉公誼、此致財政部稅務署、</p>

<p>新闢路綫同時行駛　滬南公共車現僅爲一路龍華綫、二路半環城路綫、茲爲發展交通起見特新闢綫路兩條、（一）從斜昋盧經西門至肇嘉路十六舖、（二）從斜橋沿陸家浜至滬軍營經里馬路半城圓路至斜橋爲終點、該兩路綫同時於三月一日起行駛、</p>
<h3>上午　公共租界健康良好</h3>
<p>工部局衛生處長上年度之工作報告云、是年雖夏季奇熱、雨景缺少、而大體上重大傳染等病均不多、以死亡率言之、則外僞爲千分之一一·四三、與世界各主要城市比較、頗無遜色、但滬埠外僑中、老弱之數皆少、是亦死亡率小之原因也、中國居民死亡率爲一四·二五、數亦不高、惟此項記載、尚不可恃、且有未能加以管理之因素、未可爲據、</p>
<p>霍亂病絕無僅有　上午霍亂病幾於未曾發生、此現象計已連續兩年、其歷來循環性、既已未破、則今年似不致大發、但難斷言、惟天花於一月及三月頗流行、曾達一星期二十一件之高度、又腸胃病如傷寒及痢疾亦頗多、傷寒之預防注射、已辦理數年、似未見大效、須再加防範、至於痢疾、非俟界外之清潔有大進步、及萊品之消毒有切實辦法後、不易制止、除蠅工作、已試行新法、或有效騐、此非長期的努力不可也、</p>
<p>學童體質之檢查　本年衛生處之一般工作、頗爲平靜、惟對於學校生徒之體質檢查、係屬創辦、已先自局立之華童學校著手、由初步調查之結果、發見砂眼及其他有傳染性之癥甚多、即時從事預防、所費無幾、但可避免來日之傳播、所得實巨、</p>
<p>牛乳消毒及檢騐　牛乳調查委員會研究之結果、主張將所有［乙］級牛乳及乳酪、一律強制消毒、上海天氣較暖、牛乳易致危險、故消毒實爲必要、而因乳業之發達及競爭、不致提高售價、至乳廠之空前發展、固因中國民民飮用者日多、但監察之得力、其關係當亦不小、因本埠乳牛患傳染病之損失頗大、對於牛隻之隔離辦法、已予以注意、各乳廠主頗肯合作、似已略收防止之效、此外對於外埠牛隻之輸入、亦以擬定章程、俟國民政府頒定辦法後、得循照實行、以歸一致、</p>
<p>各醫院再謀推廣　本年中各醫院未有大擴充、西區之熱癥疾院、須一九三五年方可著手建造、神經病者收容益感困難、但現已將神經病醫院略爲修改、而本局對於閔行新在建造慈善醫院、亦已予以補助、或可略紓此方之顧慮、至對於一般病癥之設備、則醫務調查委員會之建設、已經再加詳細研究、衛主處之意見、以爲不妨隨時設立應需之診治所、而對於相當之醫院予以補助、令其爲本界預留若干之床位、此意已得董事會之贊許、</p>
<p>鉤蟲癥特加研究　因某醫師之提起、對於鉤蟲癥是否由公園傳及兒童、曾經詳加研究、惟調查殊難著手、只查得有園中僱員數人、染有此癥、惟　此亦係平常現象、現已舉行大量施治、再行觀查、又對於園外傳入之危險已加意防止、但兒童如仍赤足行走鄉間各處、則防範亦難有效耳、</p>

<h3>國聯與各國　謀敎育電影合作</h3>
<p>函知國際敎電恊會決議案</p>
<p>謀今後與各國合作辦法</p>
<p>國際敎育電影會議、於一九三四年四月在意京羅馬舉行、到有英美德意暨中國等四十國、及國聯秘書廳、國際勞工局、世界文化合作會之代表、並有著名敎育家及電影技術專家參加、大會之重要決議爲「電影之國際任務」一案「」該決議案之要點、爲喚起各國政府注意電影之國際作用、以爲促進國際間精神接近之方法、及增進各民族間之了解、而明瞭各民族之物質及精神生活、經國際敎電恊會將該案送請國際聯合會國際文化合作委員會核議、交由各國文化合作恊會盡力輔助此案所列各點得以實現、合作會秘書處已通知各國文化合作恊會、與各國敎電恊會接洽、以便恊同合作、訂一公共方案、期於提案收得良好結果、中國敎育電影恊會、於國際敎電會議開幕時、會請駐意使館秘書朱英爲代表、大會並選我代表爲副會長、茲接得國聯前項決議案之通知、擬函微世界文化合作中國恊會籌委會意見、以便共同進行、茲將該決議案錄下、（一）大會公認彼等工作重要之目的、在使電影之任務、爲培養民衆道德及知識之工具、藉以增進彼此間之互相了解、</p>
<p>大會認爲電影既負有敎育之使命、因此電影劇本作家、製片員及企業家以至於主管機關及凡從事發展電影之團體、或個人之責任、亦大大增加、</p>
<p>大會認爲各國間應盡量交換敎育電影片、此爲增進民族間互相了解之一極有效方法、其檢查關稅、行政限制、應因此減縮至最低限度、以使不影響於推行交換事宜之原則、同時大會亦承認檢查及行政上之限制亦能防止不忠實的製片家·及影片商人攝製挑撥民族間惡感的影片之傳布、</p>
<p>本會竭誠希望各國政府以後採用一切有效方法提倡大公無私影片之流傳、並嚴行取締顛倒是非之取締、</p>
<p>爲實現上項原則起見、大會建議敎育電影恊會特別、對於與世界文化合作恊會巴黎執行部聯合工作之顧問及專門委員會、採用以下辦法、（甲）喚起各國政府注意電影之國際作用、並可用爲促進國際間精神接近之方法、可隨時與政府當局接洽在國內訂定適當辦法或與商訂國際恊定專定之意見、以及事先之研究使正式條文、易於草成、便向政府提出、（乙）設法促進影片製作人直接團結辦法、如紳士恊定、彼此相互鼓勵製造公正不阿的之影片、使在文化上具有真正價值而能增進民族間之了解、（丙）藉各國民成立之敎育電影地或通信員或創立是項組織、以期徵集並整理各國關於電影之材料、俾能明瞭各民族之物質及精神生活、（丁）爲達上項目的、須盡量與各國政府及一切有關之國際機關團體、隨時接洽、</p>

<h3>全國勞展評判總報告（七）</h3>
<p>附錄</p>
<p>一般觀衆對於全國職勞展覽之意見</p>
<p>此次全國職業勞作成績展覧會、參觀者近十萬人、當時及事後、發表批評意見者、不下千人、以學界敎育界爲多、茲根據所有材料、擇要分述於後、藉資參考、</p>
<p>甲　概括批評</p>
<p>觀衆評語、以概括的方面爲最多、可彙別爲、</p>
<p>（一）贊譽者、（二）不滿者、（三）懷疑者、三種、</p>
<p>（一）贊譽者</p>
<p>一、規模宏大、作品精良、初次有此成績、殊爲難得、</p>
<p>二、此次成績、爲發展生產敎育與職業敎育之先聲、已走入生活與敎育連鎖之途徑、</p>
<p>三、此次成績、與「建國育民、復興文化」、大有關係「」</p>
<p>四、我民族的才能力量與精神、均可於此次作品上微證之、惟須注意此等才力精神之應用與集中、及其鍜練與儲蓄、</p>
<p>五、國防設計品甚多、足見各校頗能注意國防敎育、</p>
<p>（二）不滿者</p>
<p>一、玩具多、用品少、美術口多、實用品少、享樂品多、生產品少、「供少數人裝飾玩賞的東西太多有關國計民生者太少」、與社會實際生活不能有緊切之適應、</p>
<p>二、大部份出品、未免失之「作而不勞」、或勞力甚微、與勞作主旨不符、</p>
<p>三、因襲仿製者多、發明創作者少、</p>
<p>四、各省市出品原料、對於本地特產及本國物料、每多忽略、不知利用、甚至在本可目供範圍內、仍購取歐美日本材料、舍近求遠、重人輕已、此乃民族妄自菲薄的心理、</p>
<p>五、此次出品中、最缺略者爲農藝品、此外如重工業、機械工藝、家事、敎育用具、金工、水產標本、鑛物標本、科學儀器、化學工藝、工作圖說、化學上軍事用品、及最普通的應用品等項亦不多、</p>
<p>六、勞作出品多偏於工藝方面、範圍殊狹、此次展覽會、不知者幾疑爲全國工藝出品展覽會、</p>
<p>（三）懷疑者</p>
<p>一、有一部份成績、恐非完全出自學生之乎、或係敎師喫苦、或係工人庖代、或係購自外方、</p>
<p>二、陳列贗品、僞飾標籤、實失去提倡生產敎育之本意、</p>
<p>三、實現勞作之真精神、當從毋假造做起、</p>
<p>乙　一般希望</p>
<p>（一）職業勞作敎學問題</p>
<p>一、今後應推廣生產敎育、以生產技術爲訓練學生之主旨、</p>
<p>二、今後勞作對象、應以能發揚民族意識與精神者爲主、</p>
<p>三、今後出品、應趨向大衆日常實際應用方面、使學校敎育與社會需要打成一片、</p>
<p>四、機械工業、應積極提倡、方足與各國並存於科學競爭之世界、</p>
<p>五、傳統的手工敎學法、應即改變、敎師責任在轉導學生自由創造、</p>
<p>六、職業敎育重生產結果、勞作敎育重工作過程、兩者目的、應分別清楚、</p>
<p>七、剌繡縫紉等課程、應注意工作效率與應用方面、各種勞作、應注意經濟的條件、不可費錢過多、</p>
<p>八、成績應注重平時的製作、不可爲展覽而始準備、致始「臨時抱佛腳」之譏、</p>
<p>九、各校勞作敎育、應認真施行、不可敷衍了事有名無實、</p>
<p>（二）倡導與鼓勵問題</p>
<p>一、當局應急起直追、努力倡導、並設法獎勵、</p>
<p>二、對於各省市近於民生實用的成績品、宜加以統計、並設法誘導、而發展之、</p>
<p>三、出品有益社會者、應請褒樊、許專利製造、或免稅、或減輕其稅率、以示提倡、</p>
<p>四、對於此次敷衍塞責之省市、應加申斥、</p>
<p>（三）設立學校與工廠問題</p>
<p>希望政府擴設職業學校與製造工廠、以培養從事生產事業之人才、但設立工廠應在設立學校之先、方合程序、</p>
<p>（四）成績選擇標準問題</p>
<p>一、選擇成績標準應嚴密規定、並請專家設計、</p>
<p>二、作品宜富有敎育意義、且宜重質不重量、</p>
<p>（五）邊區成績徵集與改進問題</p>
<p>一、此後當局一方應督促邊連省份注重勞作、他方更應注意微集方法、俾各處均有出品參加、</p>
<p>二、嗣後敎育、應向邊遠省份著眼、不應再向江南繁華區域作「繡球式」的運動、致成畸形的發展、</p>
<p>（六）作品統制推銷問題</p>
<p>一、各種特雖作品、應有統制方法、推銷全國、</p>
<p>二、應設立全國職校出品公司於首都、附設國勞作特殊材料交換處、藉便研究、</p>
<p>（七）師資培養問題</p>
<p>一、統計所需勞作師資、設立勞作特科師範、</p>
<p>二、舉辦勞作敎師講習會或討論會、指定現有勞作敎師、在假期內加緊訓練、</p>
<p>三、在師範學校中、注意課程與師資、以培養適合負勞作敎育責任之人才、（完）</p>
<h3>受經濟不景氣影響　本學期私校學生減少</h3>
<p>學期開始已久舊生大半未到</p>
<p>市校收費較廉新生仍然擁擠</p>
<p>年來因受經濟不景氣影響、學生數量漸減、本學期開始已久、而各校學生報到者甚少、上海誴記者、茲探誌各情如次、</p>
<p>私校學生減少</p>
<p>本學期私立學校、自學校開始以來、業逾半月、而舊生報到入學者僅佔三分之二、尤以私立中學爲甚、間有數校尚不及上學期半數者、其故因農村經濟困難、又值年關剛過、內地學生大半因無法籌費、而因此輟學、至新生入學者亦已減少、故各校至今尚繼續招生也、</p>
<p>市校仍形擁擠</p>
<p>惟市立學校、因校費低廉、故本學期學生仍然足額·如務本·敬業·新陸·萬竹·和安·西成·尚文·等校投考踴躍、每次招生、應考者超出數倍、以名額所限、有志者祇得向隅、再敎會學校學生未見減少、因入此等學校讀書者、大半資產者之子弟、故受影響不大云、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （蕉心）</p>
<p>鴉片煙槍煙半上的洞眼，小得不過菉荳般大，但是它能夠把你的財產名譽都吸了去；就是你的生命，結果也要葬送在這洞眼里。</p>
<p>一朶鮮豔的花，由花匠的手里挿在你的衣襟上，你至多不過對這朶花嗅一嗅香味。如果換了一個妙齡少女，愛嬌地挿在你的衣襟上，你便要受寵若驚地對這花十二分寶貴了吧！</p>
<h3>無貓國</h3>
<p>— 恂子</p>
<p>記得二十年前，商務書館出版有一本童話，呌做『無貓國』，大意是說：『海外某國是沒有貓的，所以到處鬧著鼠患，湊巧有條中國商船帶著一隻貓，被國王用著價購去』。</p>
<p>江西影德鎮，是著名產磁的所在，那里的『鼠患』，簡直和『無貓國』不相上下：兩三斤重的『碩鼠』是不希奇的。俗語說得好，呌做『老鼠白日過街，衆人喝打』—在景德鎮，白天老鼠在街上走，大家都覺得『司空見慣』，不但沒有喝打，并且還沒法打他：因爲你不去惹那老鼠時，那老鼠大模大樣，好像不把人放在眼里，等你想找傢伙揍他時，他早一溜煙給腳底你瞧了：所以白天眼睜睜地瞧著滿街都是老鼠，竟奈何不得。一到夜晚，那更不用說，簡直便是老鼠的世界了。</p>
<p>景德鎮未嘗沒有貓，只不過物稀爲貴，一頭貓的代價，一兩塊錢是不稀罕的：一個不小心，家里的貓，給偷兒捉去，變了錢啦！所以不得不把貍奴用繩索拴著，拴得那貓兒十年養氣，無明努火，早已拋向爪哇國里，憑你鼠輩鬧的翻江攪海，他老人家只是結你一個不聞不見，這樣一來有貓便和無貓相等啦！</p>
<h3>關於「賣小孩子呀」</h3>
<p>— 張凰</p>
<p>買賣人口的勾當，本是人類過去歷史上醜惡的痕跡；可是在災荒年歲和窮極無奈的時候，人們情甘犯罪，用侵略手段去求生存；何況賣孩子好比剜他自已的肉補他自已的瘡，法雖不容，情實可憫。我們聽到那街頭巷尾—最多在凄涼暮夜，急景凋年—的「賣小孩子呀」的呼聲，誰不動人類的同情，自該饒怒這行爲了！假冒賣孩子的行爲祇想騙幾個錢，像本報某君所述，這也是在情理中意想得到的事。</p>
<p>有一天，我在我友劉君紫霞家里閒談，恰和大家同聽得衖里有賣孩子的呼聲。僕人和孩子們都說：『這定是真情，但聽這心底發出凄厲打顫的呼聲！』幾個受過相當敎育的朋友發表聰明的竟見：『這是假戲罷？做作得像纔動得人。他們怎肯真把自已的孩子賣掉，只圖人家捨給幾個錢罷了，除非孩子是拐到的。』紫霞句郤有他的意見說：『佛此因由想多弄幾個錢的，或是有的，也許占了多數，不過他們沒有其他妙術會施，只得把賣孩子動人的憐憫；爲什麼他們不該受人憐憫呢？還有那當真預備出賣他們自已的孩子的，出於小孩過剩，或望孩子能得較優的前程，或其他原因，若碰到這樣聰明—料知其詐—或老世故—洞識其奸的人，豈不絕了生路？』大家默然。</p>
<p>此後我每逢聽到賣孩子的呼聲，總不禁想到紫霞兄的議論。</p>
<h3>綿羊之命運</h3>
<p>— 士英作</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第九回　不善恭維求人遭叱咤未能歸去隨客惑誇張</p>
<p>我雖是個男子，你是母女兩個同去的，總不要緊。我那里有熱茶，你們可以喝上一碗，我一面寫個字條，悄悄的送到前面西餐大廳上去，通知程先生。事情成不成，總給你們一個信，不比在這里哭強的多嗎？胡氏雖是聽他說得言之有理，但是他不知道張介夫是怎樣的一個人，還不敢冒險去，不作聲。月英道：好罷，娘，我們到這位張老斧屋子里去。在以先我也見過他的。你今天晚上，還沒有吃飽呢，不要凍出病來。張介夫道：是呀，不要凍出病來。就是那程先生回斷了你們，說不定，我還可以給你們想點法子。這句話，卻是把胡氏打動了。就低聲問著月英道：我們去嗎？月英道：我們可以去的。若是程老斧說是不行，我們就回去了。夜靜更深的，我們只管在外面作什麼？胡氏道：誰又不是這樣說呢？介夫道：好罷，你們不用顧慮了，跟著我來就是了。說著，他已是在前面引道，而且還不住的回轉頭來，向他點著。這呌胡氏母女不得不跟他走了，於是胡氏扶了月英的肩膀，隨著介夫後面，走到這小院子里來。介夫是走兩步就停一會，停了好幾停，才把他們引到屋子里面來。在燈光下再看他母女二人的顏色，月英究竟年輕，那還好一點。這位朱胡氏，披著兩鬢散髪，那枯瘦而帶灰色的面孔，一條條的涙痕。身上那件藍布褂子，在牆上揩來了不少的黑灰。再向下面看去，那青布褲子，露出兩三寸的小腳鞋襪很䐰腫的，，幾乎是只看到兩根杵在地面上，那有腳形呢？（一三三）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>第二十二章　黎園別部</p>
<p>照宮中的習慣，雖然不是明定的法制，逢到每月的朔望兩日，照例是唱一次戲的。這些戲的腳本有許多就是太后自已所編的；原來太后對於中國的古劇認識得也很深切，再加伊的文學本來也有相當的根底，所以要寫些劇本，實在不是一件難事！宮中唱戲原也算是家庭娛樂的一種，故除元旦，元宵，和萬壽節等大日子，難得召幾班外面的伶人進宮演唱之外，平常日子都是由一班太監擔任的，他們也都曾下過一番苦工，能戲極多，有幾個傑出人才的技藝，反比外面的伶人更好，這是太后久已引爲快事的。</p>
<p>僥倖得很！太后爲著追念同治而傷感，以致於使整個的古宮籠罩在一片愁雲慘霧之下的第二天，恰巧是月半，正該輪到唱戲的日子。往常，每當朔望的前一日，太后多半是預先會把明天要唱的戲點定了，盼咐下去的；而且伊所點的戲，往往老是那麼幾齣。這幾齣當然就是老人家所最愛聽的，伊雖連續的一次，五次，十次的聽下去，也不會覺得厭煩的；這中間，自然又要算伊本人新編的戲佔多數！因此，外面的人——包括一切王公大臣——雖從沒有機會聽到太后所編的戲，而我們這幾個，卻無不聽得十分爛熟，連字句也背得出來，甚至已聽厭了，巴不得太后不要再點出來；因爲我們所最愛聽的戲，終究還是那些原有的老戲。這些老戲不但是歷史悠久，而且無論那一處的戲班子，都有相類的腳本，祇是演員所用的方言不同而已；它們的所以能流傳得既久且廣，當然自有一種引人入勝之處！（二四四）</p>
<h3>到日本去（下）</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>船行十五小時到長崎，停三小時。便可以上岸，足夠我們的考察了。再行十二小時便可到神戶，稅關距離得近，可以步行。將行李打開檢查之後，到「三，宮」火車站乘火車，便可往大阪考查工業，京都參觀皇宮，名古屋的文化，東京的交通設備和商業。其他名勝很多，足以使你有不少的收獲，到回國後採用的。</p>
<p>你可以不必膽小，如若你不認識路途，可以喚汽車，略有讓價，最廉的不到半塊錢。人力車很貴，千萬不可嘗試，誰說日本小販車夫都很誠實，你不要太迷信，我曾經被欺騙過的。</p>
<p>出來考察，不要多帶行李，那里運費很貴。同行的帶子一個鐵箱，費了六塊多錢的運費，和一個人的車票相等。火車運費以重量計算，運送店運行李以件數計算，大約每件二角至四角。火車票快車票，寢車票，要分別購買。三等車內有「水汀」抽水馬桶「自來水」，十年以後，中國或許才有罷。</p>
<p>當你到了東京以後，可以到青年會，找姓張的幹事。他可以解決你一切衣食住行的困難問題。你倘然要使得你事業發展，或是要得些新知識，到日本去，或者是一個好方法。</p>
<h3>遺産由狗承繼</h3>
<p>富有的狗主，為了愛狗心切，在臨死之時，遺囑上寫下一筆遺産，由他的愛狗承繼，這些事情，在歐美各國，也時常有得發生。甚至在遺囑上劃岀幾千金錢的鉅産，歸狗承繼，不久之前，有一個富翁，當然也是愛狗迷，當他臨死之前，在遺囑的上面，劃岀二十萬金鎊，由他的愛狗承繼。這種事情，祗有狗迷過多的國中，才會發生吧？</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>談談刀魚</h3>
<p>— 椀公</p>
<p>刀魚的出產地，沿江一帶的湖出產的最佳，每年產量很多，都運銷到蘇州和上海，供都市的人們享用，太湖的漁家，反而吃不著多少，這也和「遍身羅綺者，不是養蠶人」同一樣悲慘吧刀魚鱗細而肉啟，腴腴而不膩，鮮美遠在鰣魚白魚之上，若將人比魚，那末；鰣魚是成熟的豔婦，白魚是賣弄風情的俏婢，刀魚是荳蔻梢頭的閨秀：端莊雜流利，剛健含妸娜的十六歲小姑娘。</p>
<p>因爲它的本質特美，所以無論如何煮法，都極其可口。現在略舉幾種煮法來：</p>
<p>清蒸刀魚：取新鮮刀魚一條，剖腹去雜腸，略用水沖去血污即得，千萬不可去鱗——因爲它的鮮味，都在鮮刀魚一條，剖腹去雜腸，略用水沖去血污即得，千萬不可去鱗——因爲它的鮮味，都在鱗上。然後放進有蓋的淺磁盆里面，加一些生薑，蔥把，生豬油塊，和幾滴料灑，一小撮精鑒，擱在蒸籠里，蒸三十至五十分鐘，火候不宜太過，過了火，就會老而且僵，失去它鮮收的本味，照這樣清蒸的吃法，要算最上乘。</p>
<p>紅燒刀魚：這是普通的做法，味兒雖然比清蒸來得濃厚，但是已經掩卻它幾分真味，所以內行的吃家，總是吃清蒸的多。</p>
<p>炸刀魚：這是怕剌的人們的吃法，用較小的刀魚，也同樣的——照清蒸時的一樣，剖腹去腸微洗，不過要去鱗才好，先預備一盆攪碎的鷄蛋和灰麵，同時預備半錢香油，等油煎滾了，把魚放進鷄蛋灰麵盆里打一轉，然後放進油鍋里，煎到微黃，就撈起來，因爲經過油炸之後它的剌都酥了，不會卡著，這種做法，雖然香脆可口，但是它的真味，祇剩二三分了。</p>
<p>刀魚麵：頂好是自家做：用尺來長的大發魚，把它蒸熟，把鱗輕輕揭去，用筷子夾起來輕輕一抖，全身的肉，就和剌脫離關係了，如果有些小剌粘著末再用夏布袋擠一次，是再清楚沒有了，然後用原汁湯，和它的肉糜煮麵，那才鮮美得很！</p>
<p>刀魚飯：把一條刀魚破開洗過之後，用三四根竹釘，從它的脊樑，釘住在鍋蓋上，鍋里照平常一樣地煮飯，到飯熟的時候，把鍋蓋揭開，——注意要輕揭，所有的刀魚肉，自然通通的落到飯面上，剌呢？因爲被竹釘釘住了，全副整個的懸掛在鍋蓋上，不會有一根落到飯里的，這一小鍋飯，飽含著刀魚肉和汁，盛起來，加上作料，煮成湯飯，真可謂鮮美絕倫啦</p>

<h3>紗花　補空發動紗花回漲</h3>
<p>紗市上日慘跌後、今則反動驟起、引動獲利者大量的抵補、晨間長豐號及昶記兩經紀代內地某紗廠購進、約有一萬包之巨、均係空頭了結、致極度恐慌之市面、暫現穩靜之象、不過現紗銷塲、又轉清淡、但查多空兩方、皆係大批了結、市價目前、或可立定、</p>
<p>長豐補進七千餘包</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、近期三個月承上之虛風而不穩、一般浮多陣綫、日現動搖、忍痛斬結者較多、本月份頭船形勢異常惶駭、賣風特熾、敲破八十元關口、爲七十九元、三·四月期亦跟跌五六角、拍至後三個月期、詎料長豐昶記兩商號、突然來進、且購勢銳利、一鼓虛風、忽然消散、所有飄浮之籌碼、掃數被其搜罄、故遠期反漲二四角、二三盤仍平定不動、結果各月均漲二三四角、午後開前、聞大量的買者係紗廠商抵補後市續進、致枱而轉緊、各月又漲二三四五六七角、查賣出吉豐二千二百包、大孚三千二百包、通記一千六百包、合興一千四百五十包、廬豐一千包、信誠、千零五十包、源大八百五十包、均昶一千一百五十包、元一六百五十包、大昶一千包、買進大豐一千零五十包、昶記二千六百包、均昶九百包、仁豐七百包、泰昌一千五百五十包、長豐七千七百包、賡豐七百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>花市跌後、反動驟起、雖海外印美棉市繼續下降、本埠人心依然緊昻、因本月份交貨筆碼、未能充足、同時紗市又起回風、午後金價上漲、買戶愈湧、市盤乃漲、但紗花比價上棉價太高、</p>
<p>鄭標回起三角許</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、美棉微漲一磅音、印棉續跌一羅比七五至二羅比二五、而金價仍小、塲中賣戶較上日減縮、紗市拍至遠期見硬、人心未鬆、結果各月均漲五分至一角、午後開盤即見緊張、因金價回漲十元光景、印棉暗盤漲○·七五羅比、又有一說、本月份交貨不多、散戶活動抵補、各月又漲二角至二角半三角、查賣出潤康五千七百擔、大孚一千七百擔、賡豐一千三百擔、大昶一千六百擔、源大二千七百擔、泰興一千一百擔、元一二千擔、信誠一千一百擔、買進大福一千一百擔、木康一千六百擔、大昶一千八百擔、泰昌一千一百擔、通記二千七百擔、大豐一千八百擔、賡豐一千擔、均昶一千二百擔、同興一千四百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>糧食杜米呆滯洋米暢銷</h3>
<p>杜米　昨日滬南來源、與前相仿、仍祇二十二三號（貨共近四千石）、銷塲亦見滯、本街既淡、客路祇辦二三百包、爲此市色常呈疲軟、似一時尚難振作、逎各厚粳價步落角許、薄稻繼修近尺耳、其杜洋尖乏貨無市、陰變元頻現軟風、</p>
<p>滬北　河下到船十餘號、市上消塲極呆、中次白粳價跌小角外、莤墩早稻嘉善早稻價短七八分、變元帶軟、其餘之價平疲、惟頂薄稻到貨稀少、去路活動、其價喊緊、而頂羊尖開盤以來乏貨、昨市初見、故而價形堅挺、</p>
<p>洋米　市況、客貨仍食、滬寗滬杭兩路各埠胃口尤佳、昨日更有甬紹幫暢辦、市面甚情活潑、洋米消首以三號西貢最濃、蓋爲內地災區所需要、昨日現貨三號西貢開二萬多包、期貨二月份亦有三百噸成交、西貢一二號及碎尖又逼遜一三號及碎及碎米等共計開出七八千包、客秈開出四千多包、密秈爲南京福州及本街內地等繼續問津、去胃甚貪、但以到頭不湧、市乃步步見展惟洋米本有上展之趨勢、奈存到兩足、且報載有五六百萬之定貨、人心不免虛軟、故除三號西貢外、其他均處平軟、然此大批定貨中、有一部份爲浙省贛省所分去云、</p>
<h3>粉麥行市多存戒心</h3>
<p>粉市以洋麥報價、芝加哥漲二三角左右、坎拿大漲八分左右、當開價後、本月份市氣、因津幫去路接續、人心平靜、遠期則以連日金價大落、滙率見長、故浮多心思、不負打動、市氣遂見鬆落、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易、均轉清淡、本月份客幫微有交易、市仍平平、遠期則因外滙日長、及廠方微拋、致人心均難振動、觀察後步、須看洋麥之定價如何也、結果本月份跌一分、三四月份跌一分半、五月份跌二分、六月份跌一分、七月份跌一分半、</p>
<p>麥市各月份、大致呈停滯不發之象、本月份因距交割又近、奎貨中聞有中交貨、收者較少、因此多頭放鬆、市氣轉軟、遠期則雖洋麥可套、惟在此搖搖不定之時、行家亦不肯冒險從事、是以交易既清、市亦平穩也、結果本月份跌二分、三月份好一分、四月份小一分、現麥市面、尚呈定勢、中次喊低一二分、高貨如常、開山東歸德麥三元九角、次八角、計一千包、由申大信大辦去云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥、現貨商購進、市面浮多已近廓清、此即係價格或能上升之基礎、</p>

<p>餅銷停頓</p>
<p>黃豆去路亦呆</p>

<h3>信認自然力的兩面</h3>
<p>— 稜磨</p>
<p>雖然『現代』在歷史家，人類學者的術語上是被稱爲文明時代，而且爲現代人所已知的又明的最高時代，以示別於野變時代，但現代人的生理，幾乎仍然完全還是野蠻人的生理。現代人的心理，雖然比較是複雜多，但我們如承認野蠻人發明治鐵和現代發明改變元素是同樣的困難，則我們足以對野蠻人自誇之處也並沒多少。野蠻人用最大的努力所追求的是食物，我們現在所費的力量，最大也是在食貨方面。野蠻人爲食貨的取得而不惜戰爭，我們現在也時常戰爭，而且仍差不多是同樣的意義。</p>
<p>自然，我們不再相信戰爭爲天命所定。有天象顯示，這就可說是我們有異於野蠻人處。忽視自然的力量，與自然抗爭，確是現代人所可以自負的。但與自然抗爭的成績，一方面我們雖部份地能控制自然，別方面卻發現自然的難然控制之處仍是太多。對於自然將給我們以怎樣的災害，我們仍不能不時懷恐懼，在這點上，我們就並不能怎樣大異於野蠻人。最近有人說太陽黑點的增加將引起電磁綫的變動而使人瘋狂，以致趨向戰爭，實可說就是這種心理。但這與其說是天文學家企圖對於被公認爲不可避免的戰爭，加一新的解釋，成爽當譏爲回到野蠻，諉之天命，還不如說是他發現『自然』的另一須控制之處，而企圖控制。因爲我們畢竟不全是野蠻人了。</p>
<p>二十世紀在光學方面的成就，誠然不小，但現在仍只能說在萌芽時代，因之對於一些難究詰的性質，還只有感覺其神秘而驚奇，而對於其作用，每有超想像的推測。其中有些確是有可靠的根據的，我們現在既知道，有一種光綫（死光），可以毀滅生命，則是否有別種光綫，會影響人的生理的疑問，就在平潰也會起的。關於電磁綫——或電磁綫的某種綫——的能致人瘋狂的說法，是僅僅如平常人的幻想，或自有其科學的根據，在我們不知到其詳細情莆的時候，還無從斷言。但現在有人在想發現一種綫，利用之使人起心理的變化的事是可以有的，如果電磁綫有這種効力，則天然的電磁綫所影響於人生的，縱微乎其微，而到人力能控制的時候，也許能造出死光以上的恐佈。我們在現在不相信將有這回事。也許並不是最聰明的辦法，除非我們聰明到對於光的了解，超過現有的知識以上。我們現在還不知有沒有直接支配心的外物，而這問題終久是要解決的。</p>
<p>不過太陽黑點影響人事說遭到蔑視，也要有理由，因爲電訊所傳，既不曾加有新奇的理由，卻很可以認爲是已死的老說的復活。從前的經濟學家，曾有把約每十年一次的經濟恐慌的原因，歸之於太陽黑點的減縮的，我們現在知道那不過是週期的偶然巧合，正如『拿破化奇數』的能算合英國參加戰爭的年代彷彿。（參看申報月刋三十號五三頁補白。其中所用某年代的數字四數相加所成數，在十九世末葉，最小不會過八，九，最大不會過二十七。在二十世紀初葉，最小不過十，最大不過二十一。故其中數大概爲十七八年，而與兩次戰爭間的間隔期差不多。因之有巧合可能。）如果真完全是這樣，自然毫無足信。但我們知道恐慌週期說的出現，是在相信一切作機械運轉的十八世紀，那時太陽黑點的週期也剛發現，所以有那樣新奇的推論。到現在已雖奇而不新，事實上是沒有人想把牠復活的。但現在有認光的質點（通常仍說波）支配一切的趙勢，因之說太陽黑點對人事的影響，也不談週期而談電磁綫了。所以這說法至少總含有時代背景。</p>
<p>如果科學就是現代人的宗敎，則現代人以野蠻相信天命那樣的信心去迷信科學，也是不可避免的。野蠻人，文明人的戰爭原因實際上確是差不多，惟因背景加裑雜，而對這命運的解釋也增裑雜爲單純，又也還只除如野蠻人堅持其信心而外，並無別法。</p>
<h3>我們這八個</h3>
<p>— 耶草</p>
<p>我們這八個：禿兒，小餅，來旺，大興，海京，春山，木星和我，一同地，我們終年在一塊兒。流浪著，用乞求來度我們的日子。</p>
<p>八個全同樣：一起是不滿十六歲，沒有家，誰全是孤兒。有回禿兒爭吃子小餅一片腐鹹肉，小餅帶了勃不可遏的怒火咒罵著：</p>
<p>「我×你媽—禿兒，你搶我的！」</p>
<p>禿兒可沒回罵，咬著下嘴唇，一股勁兒跳起來，扭住小餅儘管揍。大家的勸告是枉然的，他們撕著，揍罵著，打成一團。待小餅的鼻子揍出了血，禿兒才鬆了手。</p>
<p>晚上，我們這八個，活像八個野狗，踡伏在一個小小的角落，我們沒有，祇以破爛的蔴袋里住我們的手和腳：風，如同一條冷的蛇，無情地鑽進我們的蔴袋里，流動著，使我們澈夜得不著暖和。</p>
<p>我們睜開了不常抹洗的眼睛，在模糊的夜里交互地瞧視，十六隻年輕的耳朶，都在傾聽著從森林內送過來的陰沉的風聲。真地，由於生活史掉了寄托，我們是更想念起爹娘來了。</p>
<p>我們是長春附近焦村的人，我們這八個，自小就在一起，連年的打仗，毀去了我們的家，我們的屋子，是在那天晚夜給兒子燒去的。我們爹娘在那兒呢，祇有天纔知道：但，我們這八個，始終是在懷念著他們啊！</p>
<p>流浪着，乞求的日子彷彿是沒有盡頭的，廟字和廢宅已然成了我們的家。往年，我們家雖不怎樣寄，可是我們冬天有炕，還不愁吃的：而今呢，整年穿著襤褸的衣裳，除非在夏天，我們腳手總破製著，流那鮮紅的血。</p>
<p>我們恨透了鬼子，問心我們不怕他：我們也恨我們自已，恨我們太小了沒有力量。我們是樂觀的，我們沒有一天忘過我們的仇恨，我們把它記在心里，我們打架，我們吵嘴，第二天便會忘了的：因爲一塲怒罵，我們會更親熱起來。</p>
<p>當長春改爲新京的時候，我們這八個；一塊兒，向那兒出發了。在路上，自然，我們仍是行著乞。禿兒討來了兩個熱饅頭，首先讓給了小餅，接過來，這小子卻笑了。</p>
<p>我們是飽受了鬼子警察的腳踢，而在每人獲得了好多紫塊以後，纔離開了新京的。我們這八個，胡亂地站立著，然後用憤怒到發火的眼珠子瞧望著那此僞警：</p>
<p>待我們大了，看罷……」</p>
<h3>胡同交響樂</h3>
<p>— 胡繩</p>
<p>住在北平的公寓是永遠不會感到寂寞的。</p>
<p>先前我住在一家小小的公寓里，隣屋就有位先生能遍著喉嚨學女人聲音唱「毛毛雨」「桃花江」之類的名歌：另外還有一位，卻是個張開大嘴巴唱大面戲的角色。可是自從搬到現在這公寓里來以後，歌與戲就都聽不到了。住在這公寓里的人，想來都既不是摩登青年，又不是北京人。因爲凡摩登青年都是應該會唱「名歌」的，而既不拉弦子，又不哼兩句戲的便算不了北京人。</p>
<p>公寓里雖然清凈；住在里面，感到寂寞卻還是不會的。</p>
<p>胡同里的聲音是沒一刻斷的——這聲音和在上海亭子間里聽到的汽車聲，電車聲，載重的卡重聲，喧嘩的人聲，工廠汽笛聲……那種令人頭腦發漲的「市聲」卻是絕對兩樣的。</p>
<p>帶著要出賣的東西，或用車于推，或提在手里，從這個胡同鑽到那個胡同—這樣的小販，在北平似乎比在南方多。胡同里是找不到顧客的，他得提高聲音起來，才能讓那離開大門還有一兩個大院子的屋子里面的人知道。自然這呌賣聲音是異常響亮，同是也就尾音很長的了。他們不大肯利用旁的工具，如南方的敲竹筒，敲小鑼之類。自然也有不是靠嘴里哩的，如爲人廢刀子的便是用一個如胳膊樣長的細喇叭鳴鳴地史的，聲音雖很單調可是極凄厲。</p>
<p>賣每一種東西的都有他們底一種特別的詞句與音調，我剛來北平時幾乎完全聽不懂這呌賣的聲音。現在雖然比較知道了一點，但還有些不能聽懂，或雖然知道樣喊著的是賣什麼東西，但究竟喊的是什麼字句，卻只能「待考」了。</p>
<p>坐在房間里面讀書或寫字時候，偶一抬頭，便聽見一聲兩聲悠長的喊聲，爬過一道道牆，穿過空落落的大院子，送到耳朶里來。聲音或者是「烤白著來……真熱火呃……」，或者是「榨豆腐哎……」或者是「水薯葡——賽甜犁呃……」…有時幾種聲音交替在空中迥盪。若聲音是從旁的胡同里送來的，自然是要輕得多，但也顯得是格外地悠遠了。一切喊聲都是那麼地從容不迫，彷彿是落在空罐子里的聲音似的——是的，北平城就是個空洞的大罐子，這些叫賣喊聲便儘在這大罐子里面迥旋微洋著。</p>
<p>像賣烤白要的人是用車子推丫賣的，自然他們只能在胡同里走。但如提在乎里做賣買的，如賣南方所謂「糖山渣」的人便可以跑進公寓里來了。他們在院子里打一個轉兒，嘴里輕輕的喊：「葫蘆——冰糖」。別以爲他們不能高聲嚷，一覽出了公寓門，再一聲「葫蘆——冰糖」你聽去比在你窗前喊時卻響多了。但聲音又一聲聲地低下去了：當聲音傳來很模糊了的時候，你可以想像到他已經走完這個胡同，拐灣到另一個胡同里去了。</p>
<p>也有賣報的到公寓里來的。早晨八九點鐘便有一個老頭兒，挾著只有二來份報走進我這公寓來了。他照例只有三句話：「誰看報？哪一位看報？有看報的沒有？」說完了，若沒有人推門出來買，他便悄悄地走出去了。這和在日昇樓前狂喊著「要看申報新聞報……」的上海賣報孩子是大有「京派」與「海派」的不同了。</p>
<p>有著這樣的不斷的聲音做伴侶，住在公寓里真是不會得感到寂寞了。——雖然也許正因爲有了這些悠長的聲音，枯坐在公寓里面的人才格外地引起了空虛的悵惘了。</p>
<p>我住的這公寓因爲就靠近馬路，有時便也能聽到汽車馳過的聲音，晚上若風順，不能夠聽到較遠一點的電車行馳的聲音。——但就是這些聲音一落到北平城這一個空洞的大甕子里來，也就顯不出一點都市氣了。</p>
<h3>假面具</h3>
<h3>高空（四）</h3>
<p>— （Ｈenri　Barbusse）著狄舟譯</p>
<p>這樣，我們和文明平行而飛翔的是夜。</p>
<p>我們在黑魆魁的空間的那面，由於電光照明的巨流，遠望著文明了。通過永遠，黑暗的賬幔，飛在點點閃耀的歐洲的屈折著的緣色上面了。</p>
<p>望遠鏡里面，都市出現了。都市，起初是在黑暗當中微微發光的湖，以後變成乳色的幕，不久，不久又成爲星座。爲著把天的星座，隱於指端，和表面地烈舉出來而區別著一個一個的星座座的，我們由於那星座的阿剌伯式的樣子，辯別了一個一個的星座了。</p>
<p>低空飛行的時候，都會的發光的油滑木板，連到細小的部份，也顯出同樣的形狀。巴黎，柏林，布達佩斯，維也納。所有這些都會，都像是用化學方法在地上所放的煙火。</p>
<p>以後再舁到舉凝在地球的半面的「夜」里面—俯伏而視，是作著光輝爛的文學的天文學者。我們想起了從天上俯視著羣星的傳說的古時耶和華的事。</p>
<p>但是，常常地，我們看漏了許多大陸上面的寶石般鎮刻著的記號。這些真名字，全忘卻了，我們把空中的間架也失掉了。</p>
<p>夜，我們在（下面星座帶的）中心沿著邊沿降到地上了。他們從遠遠的那邊，看到我們的點，看到進行在多數的星中一顆侵入者的星。看到比其他的星緩慢而動的星。擦照燈的光，捉住我們。光的地道啊。小燈臺的光綫，做了白的帶把夜的半球斜斜地分成兩半。這白的繩，從我們的地方，到滿圓的月的世界，連擊著。我們在地上站著眺望的時候，看見這個月的世界面，半黑半白的人類在動著似的。</p>
<p>我們又一次地，向著太陽，向蔽滿光輝的大道一樣地，向著地球的上面進行了。這也是，我們夜間出發，在深深酣睡了的現實上面的徬徨啊。</p>
<p>遠望這地理學的蒼空，暫時之間就中絕的感動的閃耀，在遼漢的廣闊上而只搜尋到唯一的遊星點的時候，我們站在這上面的時候，想知道：不明白的地方的。那個黑暗里面所發生著的事情。我們已知道那事情了。但同時，也是不知道呢。每晚，祭祀開始時，快樂的賣買，在無際的黑暗里面發生著，這，我們是知道的。我們確信著：在文明的一切病菌凝結著的所有都會上，到處都是同樣，又，在一切地方，人生都有囚徒的生活。但，這只是腦內所知道的。爲什麼，因爲夜的黑暗的底淵，監獄的囚徒也一道擁抱起來了。夜，雖然知道人的存在，但看不見人的形態。我們，對於看不見的東西，搖之以手，把不知道的東西，抱到腕前來。人，是想揭開黑暗的布幔或想得到先進的話的。</p>
<p>不久，曙光迫近了。我們踏著灰色的緯度而走。視綫的波浪，自由地馳驅。從我們的　　攘攘的行動之中，原野的畫像出現了。—平原的姿容。或是敞敞展開的油畫似的塗抹的地帶（農塲），或是瘦瘡的污穢的地帶。（工業，機械的雷雨。）發白的和發黑的骸骨的滓渣的都市，用猛烈的傾勢，漂浮上來了。從朝就拋到街上的奇怪的都市的人們……被縛住在都市的地獄的當中的人們。—散沙般的羣集。這里，戰死者的記念碑，—骸骨的色彩，富豪的貢獻物。並且，在那里，富豪們的醜熊暴露著的而那釀態還在昻憤。小街陋卷一帶，許多的污穢蠶動著。但只有，理性的眼能看得見。我們發見了，又望後而走。我們什麼餘情也沒有，迅速地穿過了。</p>
<p>震時之後，我們很快地做著低空飛行。摩天樓的眼也在昏黑瞬間觸過。在高窗的前面啊。我們的視綫敏捷地飛進這里面。銀行的一切設備的頂上，舍庫前面，那事務室的機械裝置的用具後面，是蒼白的人們。是黃金的牡牛啊。那個男子，把電報電話的綫，蜘蛛的絲似的飛拋著。在那些總體的上面（玻璃窗的上面）寫著金黃色的字。</p>
<p>—Ｊopiter（天帝）</p>
<p>他，咻咻喋喋地。但，倒底咻喋著什麼嗎？（完）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>民間通用禮節</h3>
<p>— 頑</p>
<p>古者洽定功成，制禮作樂，改正朔，易服式，樹立一代規模，確定治國標準，自民國成立以來，軍事倥傯，未遑吏治，所以對於民間禮制服章。尚無法定標準，人自爲政，家自爲法，而無一定範疇也。</p>
<p>近者民間通用禮節案，立法院法委會推定焦易堂彭養光等十二委研究，並開會討論起草辦法，如是民間通用禮節，不久或可規定矣，因爲此種禮節，政府還沒有規定，人民便無所適從，或則延襲滿清之舊，或則摹仿歐美之制，或竟新舊雜揉，中西混合，五花八門，令人莫名其妙，所以規定禮節服章一事，實爲刻不容緩之舉。</p>
<p>焦氏前日出席立法院紀念週報告，有云，規定禮制，可提倡人民忠孝，厘定服章，可維持民族尊嚴，的確，現在的人民，對於忠孝二字，太不講究了，從前所謂事親敬長之義，刻下完全無存，提倡人民忠孝，原屬當務之急，不過提倡人民忠孝，禮節中所能表現的，僅是一種形式主義，而其精神上的提倡，尤有賴於敎育的鼓次，我意通用禮節，當以簡單易行爲主，譬如滿清舊制，可謂極提倡忠孝的能事，但其收穫的效果如何，則不言可知也，是以規定現在禮節，當先摒絕從前一切虛僞的制度，而代以重精神，尚實際的禮節，方足表現新生活運動的一種氣象。</p>
<p>至於服章之制，亦有須當詳細考慮的必要，我國素稱文明舊族，上國衣冠，大袍闊服，規行矩步，不如此不足以表示我大國民的態度，現在的潮流，此種踱方步，揩鼻頭，的腔調，恐怕也有些不合時宜了，現在應該提倡尚武精神，活潑氣概，不應該再來提倡死板板的腐化生活，前年本刋提倡過短衣生活，研究結果，多數主張，衣服長僅過膝約二三寸，對襟，並以中國法裁製，近見某省新生活運，衣服之制，亦與本刋主張相類，大約喜便利，怕累墮，其心理固相若也。</p>
<p>近日普通服之制，不是西裝，便是藍袍黑褂：完全歐化，既不足以表示我國特殊的禮節，藍袍黑褂，亦是滿清資政院的法服，此種服制，一則不近國情，二則完全腐化，似均不應再行襲取，昔趙武靈王主張胡服以敎國民，現在我國日處武力壓迫之中，自應激勵奮發，提倡尚武，以救國家垂危的現象，則衣服之制，亦宜注意及之。</p>
<h3>買舊書的藝術</h3>
<p>— 容</p>
<p>沒有錢買書的時候，即連舊書都是好的，在上海，你可以找到無數的舊書攤，而這些方地又往往能滿足你不大奢侈的慾望，譬如，你走到北四川路去，除了固定的舊書店以外，可以看見很多書攤，一本道學面孔的哲學史可以和妖嬈的香豔叢書並肩而立，古典綫裝書和舶來的蟹行文也會成爲朋友，這商人們不知道選擇，而且他們也不會選擇，古今中外三敎九流的書在那里爲一爐，沒有此這再能表現一視同仁的「大同精神」的了。他們並沒給這加以整理，而這卻如鄉間女子那樣在觀頭粗服中別有一番奇趣。又像山谷里的自然生長的野樹，不像公園里那麼剪得平平整整如剃過頭似的。在那兒你可自由搜尋，說不定會發現一個香豔的秘本，更說不定會得到無處買的禁書，有時一部外國名著會讓你幾角錢就買了來，有時你可從那書內的圖章上，簽名上，或甚至題記上推測到這原主的身世，這樣的書攤，在北四川路，四馬路，城隍廟一帶真多得很，相傳倫敦有專賣舊書的街，幾家舖子可湊齊一部莎士比亞全集。巴黎寨納河畔全是舊書攤子，有罕見的古典名著，我們沒有到過這些地方，但據自已從攤子上的經騐來說，那滋味大概是差不了多少的。</p>
<p>不過，買舊書也得有買舊書藝術，因爲有時那書商是非常狡猾的，一個對付不當就吃了大虧或弄得賭氣走開，失去買舊書的樂趣，我告訴你，單是這書攤畔的周旋就是一種藝術，從那里你可悟出做人的道理來，譬如，你要買舊書，就得常跑新書店，知道那幾本是絕了版的，那幾本書是什麼價錢，那幾個書店有折扣，最要緊，把你做成個內行，然後你跑到書攤上去，看到你正想買或有一買價值的書，你別傻頭傻腦地說：「天啊！這正是我所需要的！」，你得運用你的「功夫」，譬如，你裝出毫不在意的冷漠態度，把那書丟在一邊，臨走之時，好像隨意地回他一句價錢，說得多了，不妨冷笑一聲，將書丟下，隨便來個價錢，不過也不能相差過遠或決絕過甚，否則就弄成價局不可收拾了，這里最該注意的是，你如中意這本書，寗可在他攤旁多盤桓一刻，千萬別還價不合走開了又回來，這樣一來，說不定那市價又漲高了的。</p>
<p>一本書有沒有缺頁，有沒有污損，這都得在回價前就看明了的，否則就不免上個大當。不個你對那書也不能過度注意。做出愛不忍釋的樣子，被對手窗窺出內心的秘密，你最好往角僻地方搜求，那地方就許埋著豐饒的礦苗·我記得自已有本原版的美學書和一個朋友的兩本美國萬人叢書本子就是從那不被注意的地方找出來而用幾角錢代價換來的。</p>
<p>買書的藝術是千頭萬緒，來個譬喻，這正如血肉狼藉的捕戰，什麼時候把你敵手克服，你就可奏著凱歌滿載而歸了。</p>

<h3>聰明論</h3>
<p>— 蕙人</p>
<p>生活在現社會里·在一般人的眼里看來，是無可給人以滿足的，原因說來複雜，簡言之就是生命的Ｖitality有些那個不夠味兒：依宿命論者說來這一切都是命·因爲人生下來就得註定受苦的·而這世界世原是一個苦海。</p>
<p>但是人們總是聰明的，不肯在苦海里翻過身子逆著流衝去，不用說：風是多大，浪是多高，就是順著這苦流奔跑的人潮，也已經如排山倒海地的湧過來，擠得沒有一絲空縫兒可以給你容得過身去：不是給風浪打入了海底，便也給人潮壓扁了身子，倒不是隨波逐流，任其飄落，除了苦味以外，沒有一點點的危機，雖說前途是那麼的悠長，縹渺，但取之以比逆流走的人們，究竟省力不少了。所以聰明人便異開天想的在現實的世界外，還替他來造了一個理想中的世界—幻夢。</p>
<p>幻夢，確然再自由不過了，不敢做的，做了；不能做的，也做了。現實的缺憾，在幻夢裹全給他補足，不夠的，漆之，不臻的，改之；祇要你腦中想得出，制度的限制，你全去計畫進好啦！這個世界裹沒有危險，什麼都自由，比不得現社會那樣管束，抬頭是頂子，低頭是深山；似乎在那里，自已便是耶和華，可以支配著一切。</p>
<p>不過把話說過來，事實總是絕對的，不是Ｐasitive，便是Ｎegative，沒有什麼介乎二者之問的，要之是一個革命的戰士，反之是革命的叛徒。你真的想在現實的失敗里去造成幻夢裹的勝利嗎？要知道白天之後，果然是晚上；但過了晚上還不原是一個白天！你要想在現實裹超脫自已？哼，一乘一還是等於一。</p>
<p>告訴你，感到生活徘徊的痛苦者，倒不是日被剝削的苦力，支配苦力的資本家，而是站在旁邊的搖頭者。他們不是同情於被流汗的苦力，而祇是擔心到自已的也將淪入。</p>
<p>本來，除去了甜密的幻象套子，更形恐怖；在幻夢裹的微笑，是現實中苦涙的源泉。</p>
<p>如果人間真是有幸福的源泉，也得用人工去開掘，你要睡在床上夢見源泉，畢竟是太聰明一點了。</p>
<h3>易水上</h3>
<p>— 陳訓濤</p>
<p>從氣道上迷茫的煙塵中望去，易水自灰灰的天腳，雪練似的流進遼遠的大地，江潮迎著北國料峭的凄風微微泛起乳色的浪沫，恍若孀婦頭上的白蘭花凋殘地顫著零落的碎瓣。收回了視綫，瞥一下，週遭一簇白衣冠的送行的人們，在荊軻的眼底，彷彿都是爲他哀悼著的送葬者，他們都沉著憂鬰的臉；尤其是高漸離，從前在燕市酒酣時的那種悲歌慷慨的豪懷，此時也變悽惘了。</p>
<p>荊軻覺得此行太冒險了。他抱怨太子丹折也就在這一點。以乳臭未乾的秦舞陽爲副，挾短短的一匕首深入虎豹的強秦，未免鹵莽了吧。他相信太子丹不曾具有冷靜的頭腦，縝密的遠虛，只是感情超越了理智的一個庸人罷了。他一心想替燕國，替弱小的各諸侯吐氣，但何嘗慮到秦王的暴戾，王翦的獷惶？秦舞陽的稚弱，甚至此去將有怎樣不幸的結果他更不曾計及。雖然平生以慷慨俠烈自豪的荊軻，中心也不無爲著這而悲戚！</p>
<p>眼前淼漫連空的易水，森豎著裸露枝柯的平林，一望愴心的凄迷衰草……從此永別了吧！憶起燕市上無數的酒家，曾經和高漸離，狗屠們歌泣過的所在，從今也再不會到那兒俯仰低徊了！舉眼望見煙塵籠罩下的前路，荊軻的視綫突然被了一層潮熱涙濕，一切都糢糊了過去。</p>
<p>飄零的落葉，筱筱地承風捲了來，又筱筱地狂奔了去。高漸離悲從中來央一邊剛抱過了筑，手已興奮得發攔了，柔靱的細竹抽在絃二上，不由的使成了一閔變徵的曲調；從荊軻怨的歌聲裹便也流蕩著無窮生離死別的哀感，去國的憂思，不但這一簇白衣冠的送行者，相顧慘然地替荊軻揮一把同情的涕涙。就是凄其的冷風也向他哭泣，感傷的落葉也用肅澀的顫音憑弔他前路的悲愁！</p>
<p>荊軻的歌喉已經鳴咽不能成聲了，高漸離的筑音忽而由悱惻轉爲慷慨嚴肅。一切都沉默著，只有這沉毅的音晵有力地激動著各個的心靈，嚴肅得誰也不敢滴一點怯懦的眼涙。</p>
<p>荊軻在極度的思裹慢慢抬起頭來，眼睛往週圍作了一次巡禱；他看見太子丹疑虛而盼切的表情，秦舞陽含有侮辱性的睨視，甚至剛才同情他的送行者，似乎也在那兒暗暗地竊笑；</p>
<p>「荊卿原來是這樣的一個懦夫！王翦的獸軍只隔著一條易水了，他倒畏縮，逃避了起來。你看秦舞陽這孩子吧，多麼勇敢啊！比他更有血氣，有毅力！」</p>
<p>這在荊軻真是受了莫大的侮辱。他　　子裹哼了一聲，　　自信地。渾身因過度的興奮而發抖，突露的眼睛燃燒著烈熾的怒火，陡然掄起鐵般的拳頭向空中猛擊了一下，放開喉嚷，雄獅的怒吼長嘯了一聲，高歌道：</p>
<p>「風蕭蕭兮易水寒，壯士一去兮不復還！」</p>
<p>聲音高亢宏亮，上澈青雲，激動得各個的臉孔都由憂鬱變爲嚴厲的鐵青了。風在呼嘯著，易水淘湧著狂瀾，彷彿偉大雄渾的河山的精靈，也在轟轟烈烈地響應了。</p>
<p>荊軻帶好了兩件禮物：樊於期的，這被嫉恨的亡命者的頭顫，和夾著寒森匕首的督亢地圖：拍一下秦舞陽的胳膊，說聲：</p>
<p>「我們走罷！」那麼堅決地。</p>
<p>車的背影已在遠處消失了。太子丹他們一簇白衣冠的送別者，還望住大道上的車塵轍跡微笑著。他們期等著咸陽殿上圖窮匕現時，剌殺黷武者的一幕悲壯劇的演出。</p>
<h3>從內地進攻到都市</h3>
<h3>銀座之夜</h3>
<p>— 倩紅</p>
<p>銀座，是東京市最繁華的地方，因此，凡是到到東京的友，沒有一個不知道東京有個呌做銀座的地方而去逛一逛的，咱剛到東京的時候，也不辭勞頓的上銀座去，趟呢。</p>
<p>那是一個有著朦朧的月色的晚上我和「老東京」的陳君，從早稻田漫步至日比谷，再從日比谷到日本橋，上銀座。到了銀座，朦朧的月色是再也看不見了，就祇讓那五光十色的電流廣告，綱般的交織在空間，白木屋，松坂屋，三越幾家大百貨公司都集中在這里，日本劇塲和東京最著名的咖啡店，跳舞塲也全在這兒：那種熱鬧的地帶走，這時，正是夜市開塲的時候，馬路上固然是車中水馬如龍地絡繹不絕，兩旁的人行道上也像鄉下舉行遊神賽會時那樣的擁擴著：在馬路和人行道相隔著的中間，卻儘擺的是夜市的攤子，在這些攤子上，從日用品，食物，玩具，書藉，夜服，以至於古董，無所不有，雖然貨式和公司或店子里面所賣的是毫無差別，價錢可便宜二成以上，所以，住在東京的人都曉得趕夜市買東西的好處，金不畏擁擠的在夜市開塲的這個時候上街來。我們慢慢地走著，像鄉下人第一次進城似的，付麼都看個仔細，才知道他們無論賣什麼，都是用實騐來做廣告，比方說，你在攤子上買了一套新發明的圓規或者是一條接自來水喉的水管，那個擺攤子的人便會詳詳細細地把用法告訴你，而且實騐結你看。這確是一種很好的營業方法哩。當我們從新橋轉過左邊的人行道的時候，在那角落里站著兩個蓄著一頭亂長頭髪藝術家樣的青年，帶著他們的作品向我們來兜生意。呵！原來這便是我從前常常在書本上看見過的街頭藝術家。他們受了飢寒的驅使，而到街頭來以極其便宜的代價，出賣他們的藝術。在掛著的幾幅畫像中，我認得一個是菊池寛，畫的技巧雖然不是怎麼圓熟，然而那筆調倒是很有生氣：菊池寛的畫像也畫的很像，因此，我就費了十分鐘的時間和二角錢的代價，讓他們給我畫了一幅速寫像，又在另外一個攤子上配了一個鏡框子，一共才花了五角錢，便得到這麼一件完美的東西，在上海無輪如何是得不到的，最後，終於給陳君帶到一家最大的茶館里面，喝了一杯咖啡，飽餐秀色；才帶著燕倦的　福如興奮的心離回了銀座。</p>

<h3>什麼是我的志向呢</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我雖然沒有和先生見過面，但時常在報上看到先生的正確的答案，早已使我欽佩得五體膜拜了。</p>
<p>我現在也有幾個問題想請先生替我解釋一下。現先述一述我的狀況：我父母俱存，兩老都是半百以上的人了。有姊弟三人，以耕耘爲業，維持家庭的生計。我自小學畢業後，因經濟困難，無力再進中學於是就不得不離開書本，走入這個黑暗的社會，希望能夠得一技之長，以慰父母的厚望。現在我在人家做一個練習生，每月有九元的酬勞，在這微少的數元中，還要貼補家用若干以我經濟非常拮據，但我並不因爲困難的環境而氣餒，我要奮門。我想一人立足於社會上，不能單爲了麵包問題而生存，至少也要爲社會謀些利益，爲國家謀些幸福，那才有意義。所以我想趁這血氣方剛的時候，利用我的腦汁和血汗，依我堅決的志向去苦幹：但是我的內心，不知什麼是我的志向？怎樣才能達到目的？所以特寫信給你，懇請給我一個指示，領導我向光明的前途走去。同時我是生在這種災患頻仍的時代，受環境的驅使，各種矛盾的思想，終日在我腦海中旋轉，我常常想那一種主義，是中國所需要的呢？這實在使我徬徨極了。我想先生學識潤博，經騐豐富，定能給我一個明確的解釋吧！專上，敬請</p>
<p>撰安　　許興上</p>
<p>編者按：你在困難的環境中，能有積極進取的精神，很爲難得。</p>
<p>你說：「一人立尾於社會上，不能單爲了麵包問題而生存，至少也要爲社會謀些利益，爲國家謀些幸福。」這是很對的。</p>
<p>你想趁你血氣方剛的時候，利用腦筋和血汗，依著堅決的志向去苦幹：但是你自已卻又不知什麼東西是你的志向，所以你不知道能不能達到你的目的。這些話就不正確了。第一，一個人的志向是要到社會上去找才找得著的。單靠內心的幻想是不會有什麼正確的志向的。第二你自已還「不知什麼是我的志向」，那末怎麼會爲「堅決的志向去苦幹」呢？有什麼目的可達呢？</p>
<p>你又說：「時常在報上看到先生的正確答案，早已使我欽佩得五體膜拜了」，「懇請給我一個指示」，「領我向光明的前途走去」。在這里，我要勸你：你不要盲目地迷信我，也正和不要盲目地迷信任何的個人一樣。假使我那些文字說得有道理，你就相信那些道理好了：盲目地崇拜個人，那是多末危險的事啊！</p>
<p>現在正是學說紛紜的時候，也正是大家替中國找出路的時候，並且更是全世界在恐慌中找出路的時候，一切都沒有達到最後的階段，所以在目前，你問我什麼主義爲中國所需要的，那我是不能替你解答的。</p>
<p>不過，你自已應該努力地去研究這個問題，因爲你自已也有方法可以解答這個問題。這個最好的方法就是你打開眼睛去考察社會上的事實。哪一個主義是和事實適合的，那末哪一種主義便是中國所需要的了。用這個方法，不單你在將來能夠得到十分正確的答案，就是中國大多數的人們，無疑的，將來也會得到同樣的答案的。因爲事實只有一個，將來的答案也只會有一個的。</p>
<p>但你也不應該單憑個人的肉眼而確定一切，因爲肉眼所見到的東西，有時候卻是一種現實的皮相：並且單憑個人的考察也是有限的。因此，你還該多看幾本書。同時，你還要研究社會發展的過程，抓住現社會的重要點。這樣，你將來的志向，一定是很堅決的，很正確的，你的目的一定是可以達到的。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊　電影專刊</p>
<h3>世界電影中心倫敦將取好萊塢而代之</h3>
<p>— 塵雄</p>
<p>我在本刋上曾告訴過讀者一段消息說，英國製片家已正式向美國進攻，謀取美國各大城市開映地盤。現在，事隔一年，英國的片不單在美國已站住了一個鞏固基礎，而且英片出製所倫敦勢將成爲世界電影的中心，而數十年來惟一電影城好萊塢的權威亦將取而代之之概。</p>
<p>在最近一年來，英國影業的突飛猛進，比較它以前二十年來的影業還要厲害得多了。經過數年拼命的奮門，英國出品在美國市塲已大告成功。喬治阿理斯—銀國裹最佳的一個演員—像一顆流星的閃爍著，驟然地獲得好萊塢演員最高薪水的資格了而出現於英國銀壇了。他在英國的最近出品「鐵公爵」的完成，使美國製片家見而失色。當英國演員的薪水能與好萊塢所領受者相等時候，就可證明英國影業家已有充分的經濟準備來和好萊塢競爭的。</p>
<p>喬治阿理斯—好萊塢演員中具有資格選入電影藝術科學院的一個藝術家—被英國製片家招聘了去還不算驚奇，而最使美國影業界震動一時的就是可萊塢第一流導演劉別謙最近也被英國拉攏去了，劉別謙的聲價，除非英國影業界確有相當號召能力，才配去拉攏這位天才導演。今者美國最優秀的演員，最著名的導演，都距到英國銀壇上，這不能不爲英國影片前途，將來有光明發展的企望。</p>
<p>這兩位電影界有名望的人物，將來都以倫敦爲發展所長的根據地，而爲英國影界放一異彩，是在意料中的事。由於阿理斯和劉別謙的創例，說不定還有許多美國明星，導演，攝影，編劇等人才聯袂加入英國影界，那時候英國製片家真足以自豪一時了。現在美國製片公司看了止前情形，都驚訝英國影界勇往直前的新局面，像從前看不起英國影片的驕傲態度，現在一變而爲佩服和猜忌。</p>
<p>目前英國至少有十家影片公司的出品在世界各地開映，而素有稱霸世界銀壇的美國電影也不過有八家大影片所：倫敦出品的「英宮艷史」與「凱塞琳女皇」都是近年轟動世界銀壇的作品：高蒙出品的「阿蘭人」Ｍan　of　Aran就是獲得最近在羅馬舉行萬國影片展覽會冠軍的英國作品，還有一張「朱金昭」ＣbuChin　Chow是我國女明星黃柳霜參加表演而現在紐約最大影戲院公映著的高蒙公司傑作，開映之日羅斯福總統親自駕臨參觀，美國記者都同口稱讚的英國作品。截至最近，「朱金照」在紐約開映還是塲塲客滿，故其他城市戲院正不耐煩等候，這很英國影片輪到該地去公映的。</p>
<p>對於宣傳工作，英國影界也很努力。現在美國報紙戲院廣告，登得最大地位的是英國影片。去年高蒙影片公司開始在美國設立發行所時候，即在美國銷路最廣的影業刋物連登數期彩頁廣告，這是美國影界看見後感覺自已地盤已被勤播的先兆。從前報紙是不登英片消息的，現在英片批評，英國明星照片，英國影界消息，都是美國報紙喜歡登載的材料了。</p>
<p>蝴蝶在本片中的演出相當成功，飾紉珠少女時的幽雅，少婦時的莊嚴。飾翠兒扭怩不安的丫頭表情，以及飾幽蘭夫人時的慈愛，內心的表演甚見成功。高占非無特殊的表演，盡職而已。宣景琳保持過去的成績，嚴月閒表演甚見出色。</p>
<p>收音，攝影清晰，光綫完美，鏡頭活潑。</p>
<h3>「空谷蘭」我見</h3>
<p>— 周虺</p>
<p>首先，我該說的，本片發音的清晰，對白的純熟，乃是國產片中所僅見的</p>
<p>導演在這裹，並沒有什麼特別可取的，他只是平鋪直敘的搬演出來，沒有輕鬆，明快，緊湊的地方，這裹談不到什麼電影藝術的手法了。倒是穿挿的噱頭，使整個的悲哀空空氣，爲之調和不少，這點，卻是有相當成就的。</p>
<p>這裹，有二點使不解的：（一）柔雲的自殺，那柄兇器—手槍是從何而來的呢？在畫面上並未提及，來得奇兀。（二）記蘭蓀前者是一個參加北伐的革命份子，後者卻只是談情說愛，銷沉於聲色的青年，對於個性，未免前後太矛盾了吧？</p>
<p>演員方面，胡蝶平平，飾雍容華富貴的紉珠倒還稱職，說白也圓活。高占非無甚可取。嚴月閒是很有成績的。宣景琳也沒有使人失望。</p>
<p>至於片中穿挿的幾只歌曲，可以說是多餘而多此一舉的。攝影平平。佈影很富麗。</p>
<h3>「風流案」中法網情網的交織</h3>
<p>— 雲門</p>
<p>一位人權保障的大律師，他的責任不是應當替一般含冤負屈的弱者爭求法律公正的制裁，而竭盡其智力以辯護吧：一位綺年玉貌的少婦，是否應得享受青春的權利，而謁求著撫愛？一位不幸的少女，是否應當爲偉大的愛，而犠牲她節操和金錢？假使那位大律師因業務上關係，而投入一位浪漫富婦之天羅地綱，作爲她的情塲俘虜，同時假使他發現了某椿案中，殺人主犯就是自已愛妻的時候，那末他——人權保障者，應當怎樣辦呢？倘若那位多情的少婦，不勝春的誘惑，盲目地拋棄了家庭和名譽，找求一位知意同惦的他伴侶，而發覺了他是一個敲詐勒索的無賴了，那末她又將怎樣辦呢？又假使那位少女，到了身敗名裂，牀頭金盡的地步，方纔認識著自已情人，僅僅是個吸血鬼，那末她又能夠怎樣辦呢？這些都是「風流案」中不能解決的難題。可是殺人者死，律有常刑，妻子不貞，丈夫不忠，也是爲社會公論所唾棄的。究竟依賴著販賣愛情的寄生蟲，佔了多少便宜？</p>
<p>威廉鮑惠爾與發婦洛埃，應著觀衆們再三之申請，經米高梅公司的努力，合演了這個「風流案」。威廉鮑惠爾茂娜洛埃兩人，是觀衆們心目中認爲最適合最滿意的一對很幕上情侶。所以他和她第一部出品「俠友，」得到了異常的贊許，而第二部合作品「大偵探聶克」，竟使偵探片作風爲之一變。同時他倆合作的成功，也立定了堅固的基礎。果然，第三部合作片「風流案」又問世了。一觀上述那樣離奇曲折的情節，吾們當然信任他和她的天才，斷定可以超越前作，而饜足吾們影迷喁喁期待之慾望的。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「荒沙三俠」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>Ｔhe　Three　Musketeers</p>
<p>——巴黎</p>
<p>看了這一影片，幾乎使我無話可說。一方面，所謂武俠影片，到底給人厭倦了。另一方面，影片本身就是非常空虛的。無論對於任何影片，我們不能要求內容怎樣的充實，但是這一影片，除了表示了帝國主義士兵在殖民地，開玩笑似的殺人之外，幾乎看不到一個完整的故事的。不然，假如也有故事的話，那末因著織接的紛亂，整個的表現方法的幼稚，並不能給與我們比較統一的印象。</p>
<p>作爲武俠片的這一「荒沙三俠」，所給予人們的印象乃是騎馬的技藝很好，幾次打武也很逼真。然而這裹所要說到的卻不是這些，而是沙漠裹的風光，在影片開頭時那一塲惡戰，似乎頗爲生動，不過就僅僅是這樣的一點兒，到後來就是Ｃut　Cut的發展下去，這故事也敘述得不甚清楚。</p>
<p>假使研究Ｍontage的話，默片時代的Ｃutt　o　Cut是常常引起我們之懷想的。現在因著表現技巧的進步，人們多已忘虻了那種方法。因之，「荒沙三俠」雖然也用了極少的「劃過」及Dissolve，倒也引起了我們的注意。然而它連故事的敘述，都沒有清順的做到，其他列無從說起了。</p>
<p>觀衆意見</p>
<h3>「空谷蘭」觀後感</h3>
<p>— 喻比</p>
<p>從編製的手法觀來，本片較以前的「空谷蘭」免去了不少的拖泥帶水，當然在演出上，緊湊了不少。不過有些地方使人不甚明瞭了，如蘭蓀從戰塲歸來到紉珠家，在畫面上沒有詳細的演出。柔雲跟紉珠在深夜從臥室中至大廳中，穿過許多的門戶，而關門的聲音非常的響，難道這陶家許多的僕人，一個也不知覺的嗎？柔雲自殺，蘭蓀聞到槍聲，竟會不開門進去一看的嗎？</p>
<p>導演的手法，甚見靈活，小聰明的地方也很多，如日曆一張一張的扯去，表示日子一天一天的過去。鐘點不同的演出，表示紉珠化裝時問的多少。幾個特寫鏡頭，甚有意識。</p>
<p>電影小說</p>
<h3>塊肉餘生（Ｄavid　Copperfield）（九）</h3>
<p>— 柳村</p>
<p>大衛於都拉死後，百念俱灰。一年的出門旅行，或者能使他忘記痛苦，恢復舊日的心情。但是事實上他卻回到坎忒白雷，那里的情形，已經被尤利並喜迫弄得一塌鍸塗，而密考伯自已亦都糾緾在里面了。從前樂天知命的密考伯，現在據密昔司密考伯說，已經瀕於瘋狂之境了。他以前和善的脾氣，現在亦都銷失了。他心有所思，必思喜迫，口有所言，必言喜迫。但是最後由大衛和姑母貝測勸告的結果，他就將他所知道的，一起說了出來，並且決定了要將尤利亞從他們的生命中排除了去。</p>
<p>他們計劃定了，於是在一天，他們就將尤利亞圍困住了，環攻起來。他們手中所執的惟一武器，就是密考伯所親乎寫的一張尤利亞的罪狀，上面開頭寫的是：「我有要宣佈世界上空前所未有的惡徒的罪狀，我已不能爲我自身而顧忌。卑微貧苦，失望，本來是我一生痛苦生活中份內之事。現在雖以縲線加於我身，我亦必宣佈喜迫，喜迫之外無別人，是個僞造犯，欺詐犯。」</p>
<p>那張紙上還寫著尤利亞種種愚弄威克菲而，將似乎無關緊重的東西，叫威克菲而簽字，其實那是重要的文件。尤利亞用了這種手段，將一種信託的欵項，支了出來據爲已有，并且在許多別的字樣簿冊上，自已冒簽了威爾菲而的名字。他用盡了方法，要降服威克菲而和愛及司。</p>
<p>尤利亞受了衆人的攻擊，起初是怒不可遏，一反其平日謙恭的態度。後來大衛迫著他，叫他將股東的契據交出來，以便銷燬。尤利亞還是崛起不肯。大衛并且叫他將一切侵吞的欵項交出來，否則地立即要將地方官喊進來。這下一來，尤利亞就不得不屈服。他惟命是從的將股東契據以及侵吞的欵項，一一交了出來，因爲他自已知道，他作僞的一切證據，都在密考伯乎中，倘使驚動了官府，他是沒有倖免之理的。</p>
<p>尤利亞喜迫被逐之後，密考伯就帶了家屬啓程往澳洲去。他們臨行的一天，大衛，大衛的姑母，壁各德等，都在碼頭上送行。密考伯是興高彩烈，身上穿著航游用的油布衣服，胸前掛著千里鏡。密昔司密考伯和子女等，都打扮得像開闢新世界的前驅者的樣子。密考伯站在船頭上，向著送行的人告別道：「我們放棄了故國的豪華到新世界去開墾，我們準備著去做蔡天席地的新民！」他又轉身對著大衛，致謝他一切援助之恩。不久船就啓椗了。和密考伯家族一同走的，還有老漁丹壁各德，密昔司根密支，受密柳等。雖然沒有像以前那種快樂，但終究他們又棄首在一塊了。</p>
<p>隔了數日之後，大衛和愛尼司在海岸山麓上行走著，正要去探望姑母貝測。大衛忽然對著愛尼司道：「現在在這萬籟俱寂之中，并且當著逗美麗如畫的夕陽，我想以至誠向你說幾句話。我要告訴你——我離開你的時候，是愛你的，我和你不在一起的時候，亦是愛你的，現在我回來了，亦是愛你的。」愛尼司低聲道：「大衛，都拉撒手而去的夜間，我和她二人在一起，你記得嗎？她最後求我的一件事，就是叫我替她在你的心中佔有一個地位。我一生都摯愛著你。」他們二人站住了，在這一霎時之間，一切都遣忘了——一切點綴著大衛一生的人物，一切貧竊和痛苦，時曾愛過的人亦都散失了，祇剩了他自已和愛尼司，相對著站在這度佛而山麓之上，海濤洶湧地打在他們足邊的海岸上。（完）</p>

According to what he told a Central News Agency reporter, he and others were dispatched by the Ministry of Railways in October of the 22nd year to go to Xinjiang to survey the highway, equipped with five cars and carrying gasoline and food. They departed from Sui in November, passed through Bailingmiao, crossed the Mongolian border and the Erjina desert, and arrived in Hami in February of last year. At that time, the Sheng-Ma war broke out. At first, they were detained by Ma's army in Korla for a month, and then they were detained by the defeated army in Lop Nur for two months. After the war ended, they were detained in Shutai for various reasons. They then went to Dihua and stayed in Dihua for four and a half months waiting to buy gasoline. In total, they encountered three extremely dangerous situations. They spent only two months surveying the highway in northern and southern Xinjiang. They then passed through Hami, crossed the Xingxing Gorge, and entered Gansu. After passing through Anxi and Yumenguan, they arrived in Suzhou and then divided into two routes for surveying, one following the old provincial road to Liangzhou, and the other following the Dingxin Weiyuan city to Erjina. Afterwards, they turned back and surveyed from Liangzhou, also dividing into two teams, one team went to Zhongwei to survey the Ningshia Avenue, and the other team crossed the Wusha Ridge and joined together in Lanzhou, and then entered Shaanxi and returned to Beijing. On this trip, they surveyed two main lines, the northern line from Gui Sui to Hami, which is 1,060 miles long, and the southern line from Hami to Lanzhou, which is 864 miles long, and also surveyed two branch lines, one from Suzhou to Erjina, which is 250 miles long, and the other from Liangzhou Zhongwei to Lanzhou, which is 300 miles long. It took a year to complete the work, but he and others finally stated that this trip was purely dispatched by the Ministry of Railways and had no other purpose. × × × ×</p>

However, due to the presence of Sichuan army defenses in the Gaoqi area, they could not pass. They then entered Yunnan via a side road, intending to cross the Yangtze River via Weixin and flee to Yanjin. Currently, the bandits, numbering more than 10,000, led by Zhu Mao, have entered Yunnan.

The Tongqi Association is for ordinary civilians and is said to have reached 4,000 people. (14th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Hong Kong Stock Exchange Issue</h3>
<p>[Hong Kong] The Hong Kong Financial Commander replied to the Legislative Council member Bai Lajia on the 14th regarding the responsibility of brokerage firms not residing in Hong Kong for engaging in goods gambling. It is reported that there are inherent brokers in Hong Kong who buy and sell goods on foreign exchanges on behalf of customers, but there is no agency in the nature of an exchange. The completion of brokers' transactions is intended to deliver goods, but they do not need to declare whether they will deliver goods in Hong Kong. As for Bai's belief that the Hong Kong authorities have allowed this kind of broker to engage in the trading of goods, it is a mistake. According to Hong Kong law, there is no need to say this. The attitude taken by the Financial Secretary towards the intention of Hong Kong brokers is enough to show that the authorities do not want to interfere in the local trading of goods.

<h3>Before Currency Unification</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>Our nation's currency system is complex. It does not adhere to legal standards. Since the Republic, different standards have existed in different regions. The hardship of not being able to use currency across different locations has been deeply felt by the general populace for a long time. The poor suffer losses, and industries and businesses cannot fully develop because of it. Unexpected losses occur due to fluctuating exchange rates. The debilitation of the entire national economy is also mainly caused by the lack of currency unification.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, recognizing this, is planning gradual reforms to achieve nationwide uniformity. After a design by Kemmerer, repeated investigations and research by domestic experts have led to a proposal to mint subsidiary coins in denominations of five li, one fen, five fen, one jiao, and five jiao, based on the decimal system. Subsidiary currency notes will also be issued according to this standard, with the aim of gradually withdrawing existing copper coins and silver jiao. If this proposal can be implemented in an orderly manner, the effect of currency unification will not be difficult to achieve. However, in cities with relatively convenient transportation and developed industries, silver dollars are the standard currency, but among the lower classes, whether urban vendors or rural artisans, copper coins are still widely used. This practice is even more prevalent in remote areas. Therefore, when withdrawing mixed currencies, special attention should be paid to areas where currency is mixed. Proper organization should be carried out first, and then the legal currency system should be implemented, to avoid repeating past mistakes.</p>
<p>Our nation's national income may be substantial in total, but after distribution, individual income is very small. As a result, purchasing power is particularly low. General prices, especially for daily necessities, are mostly based on copper coins. Therefore, currency reform cannot ignore the equalization of national income and prices. Otherwise, if the law is too far removed from the actual lives of the people, there will be many conflicts. Instead of trying to remedy the situation after obstacles arise, which would cause further disruption, it is better to plan and prevent beforehand to avoid future difficulties.</p>
<p>Currently, the biggest obstacle to currency reform is that local standard currencies do not adhere to the legal standards when issuing legal tender and subsidiary coins. For example, in the Pearl River Delta region, the value of the "hao yang" fluctuates from morning to night. In addition, counterfeit coins are rampant, making it difficult for ordinary people to distinguish them. How can merchants not feel the pain? Within Sichuan province, there is difficulty in currency circulation. The exchange rate for remittances outside the province is as high as 40 percent. This is significant enough to hinder currency unification and insignificant enough to harm the locality, causing hardship for agriculture, industry, and commerce. The reflection of this on politics leads to unexpected negative consequences. In provinces such as Shandong, Henan, and Shanxi, the silver standard does not have huge differences, but the discrepancies in subsidiary coins are particularly severe, affecting the entire society. Most small and medium-sized cities in our country still use the copper coin standard. If there are fluctuations in copper coins, it will shake the market. Therefore, before promoting the standard currency, it is necessary to eliminate the inferior currencies currently in circulation, so that the decimal subsidiary coins can be promoted and the legal currency will not be affected by inferior currencies and be hidden. Then the success of the reform can be seen.</p>
<p>It is also worth noting that our country is not only a major market in the Far East but is also recognized by advanced countries as the most promising market in the world. The state of its currency circulation is of great importance. Before reforming the currency system, it is necessary to consider the trends of current currency systems in various countries. Since 1931, when Britain first devalued its currency, Japan followed suit, and other countries followed suit one after another. Even the United States, which had more than one-third of the world's cash reserves, was forced by domestic and international economic pressures to devalue its currency by 40 to 50 percent. Only a few countries, such as France and Belgium, maintained the gold standard. After devaluing their currencies, they could stimulate domestic industries through inflation, that is, raise prices, putting various productive enterprises in an advantageous position. They transformed the declining and bleak market. Britain used this to form an economic alliance within its empire. Japan developed its foreign export trade. They each achieved a period of partial stability during the global economic crisis. Secondly, due to the decline in international exchange rates, their products gained an advantageous position in foreign markets (lower value). Tangible exports increased, and intangible imports increased as well. Thus, both industry and commerce benefited. The United States implemented this later but also achieved corresponding results. However, with the unsoundness of our country's currency system, we cannot fundamentally talk about this.</p>

<h3>Military Value in Question, America Abandoning Airship Policy</h3>
<p>Many in the Navy Hold This View</p>
<p>Cause of Macon Disaster to be Thoroughly Investigated</p>
<p>[Washington] Due to the Macon's crash, the plan to continue building airships in the United States has obviously been indefinitely shelved. Senior naval officers have declared that the Navy has now ended the airship experiments. This statement has almost received unanimous support from Washington officials. President Roosevelt has declared that he has no intention of asking Congress to allocate funds to build airships to replace the Macon. The President continued, saying that if there were funds, he would prefer to use them to build fifty long-range reconnaissance aircraft rather than another large airship. However, what is now clear is that the President's attitude cannot be regarded as the United States abandoning the airship policy altogether. Although the Civil Aeronautics Committee has suggested building more large airships for transoceanic mail delivery, naval officers have apparently abandoned the airship policy, and most members of Congress also think this way. Representative Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, declared that he did not want to propose a resolution to build two large airships before Congress investigated the circumstances of the Macon disaster. The Macon's crash has proven that large airships have lost their effectiveness in naval defense. The successive crashes of the Akron and the Macon have made the actual effectiveness of airships a great question. However, Senator Robinson expressed a special opinion, saying that although three airships have crashed and more than a dozen people have died, I believe that the construction of large airships should continue. I think the success of Captain Eckener in piloting the Zeppelin is noteworthy. (National Telegraph on the 14th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Washington announced today, after hearing the news of the crash of the Navy airship Macon, that it would conduct an investigation in two phases to determine the cause of the Macon's crash. The location of the incident was about ten miles off the coast of California. It occurred at night, and a total of two people died. It is said that Chief of Naval Operations Swanson will lead the Navy Department in the first investigation. After the first investigation is completed, it will be followed by a congressional investigation. Government leaders said that some members of Congress may be sent to the Pacific coast to investigate the cause of the Macon disaster. Swanson said that he would organize a naval board of inquiry within two or three days. Mr. Swanson held a long meeting today with Representative Vincent, Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee, to discuss the Macon disaster. Mr. Swanson replied to the question of the Navy's last large airship, saying that the Navy Department has not yet made a decision about the future of large airships. Frankly speaking, I really don't know if it is worth building large airships. But the Navy now has more urgent needs. Admiral Reeves, commander of the U.S. Fleet, issued a statement saying that the eighty-one survivors would be on a warship off the coast of San Francisco to recount the Macon disaster. According to naval regulations, the naval court should be composed of three naval officers and one neutral person. To date, statements issued by naval and government officials have unanimously praised the airship's captain, Wiley. (National Telegraph on the 14th)</p>
<p>Amsterdam. Puxin, manager of the Dutch airline, told reporters that although the Macon had crashed, the company still believes that airships are a useful means of transportation. Mr. Ji expressed sympathy for the views of Mr. Eckener, who declared that these unfortunate encounters were all caused by climate change. For example, although the German airship Zeppelin had encountered storms repeatedly, it was still safe and sound. Therefore, the Macon's crash should be investigated, so the Dutch company must also investigate it for reference. (National Telegraph on the 14th)</p>
<h3>Captain Recounts the Circumstances of the Disaster</h3>
<p>[San Francisco] Wiley, commander of the airship "Macon," explained the cause of the disaster. It is said that the metal structure inside the balloon broke, and the small balloons inside the bag burst. The balloon's crack was blown by the wind and expanded rapidly, so a wireless telegram was sent for help. Later, Wiley ordered the abandonment of the airship. The process was well-ordered. The crew members jumped into the sea one by one and were rescued by lifeboats. Only two people, the wireless operator and the waiter, died because they jumped from forty meters above the water and suffered severe shocks. When the ship touched the surface of the sea, some crew members were still launching rockets at the front of the airship to guide rescue ships. When the airship touched the surface of the sea, the descent speed reached 100 meters per minute. (Havas Radio on the 13th)</p>
<h3>Two Missing, the Rest Survived</h3>
<p>[San Francisco] The crash of the U.S. Navy airship Macon yesterday will cause the U.S. Navy authorities to no longer build lighter-than-air airships. It is expected that the Navy Department and Congress will begin investigating the cause of the crash within a few days. The Macon sank about one hundred and ten miles southwest of San Francisco at a depth of 250 fathoms. It is said that the authorities do not intend to salvage it. Two crew members died. The rest were transported here by warship today. When the Macon was flying back to Sunnyvale base, it encountered bad weather and heavy fog. Suddenly, one of the twelve gas chambers in the ship exploded, so the ship's bow faced the sky and the stern faced the ground, gradually descending from a height of 1,250 feet. Although the crew members wanted to make it parallel, it was ineffective. After the ship touched the water, the crew members escaped in rubber lifeboats and were later rescued by a warship. As for the two missing people, they have probably drowned, and their bodies have not yet been found. (Reuters on the 13th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Army Considering Demonstration Flight to Hawaiian Islands</h3>
<p>[Washington] Officials here indicated today that the U.S. Army is considering a demonstration flight from Hamilton Field to the Hawaiian Islands.

<h3>Philippine Governor Returns Home at Roosevelt's Summons, Arrives in San Francisco</h3>
<p>Optimistic About the Future of Independence</p>
<p>[San Francisco] Philippine Governor Murphy arrived here today and will soon depart for Washington to report to President Roosevelt on the political, social, and economic situation of the Philippines. Murphy met with reporters on the Coolidge presidential ship and said that he absolutely trusted the transitional government that is now being organized and that it has great potential for development. Murphy said that after the ten-year term of the transitional government expires, the Filipinos may try to change the provisions of the Tydings–McDuffie Act regarding the status of independence, but it is too early to predict at present. San Francisco Mayor Rossi personally boarded the ship today to formally welcome him. It is learned that Mr. Murphy and his party will leave tonight, stay in Los Angeles for two days, and then go to the capital. (National Telegraph on the 13th)</p>
<h3>If War Breaks Out Between the U.S. and Japan, Japanese Residents May Cause Trouble</h3>
<p>20,000 Japanese Residents in California Can Be Armed for Action</p>
<p>Japanese Fishing Boats in the Port of Los Angeles Are Also Noteworthy</p>
<p>—Warning from Democratic Congressman—</p>
<p>[Washington] Democratic Congressman Dockweiler declared to the House Military Affairs Committee today that if war breaks out between Japan and the United States, a quarter of the Japanese residents in California are prepared to serve their motherland. I know that out of the 100,000 Japanese residents in California, 25,000 will go to war in uniform. Although I am exaggerating, there are 150 Japanese fishing boats in Los Angeles, and they are not really fishing boats. At this point, the chairman of the committee, Mr. McSwain, rose to stop him, saying that this testimony could only be presented to the executive meeting, so Mr. Duke Weller stopped speaking. Mr. Dockweiler repeatedly stated the necessity of the defense project on the West Coast at the beginning of the meeting. Mr. Weller said, you still remember that Japan declared that it will withdraw from the League of Nations next year? But Japan has not returned the four hundred trust territories of the League of Nations. Japan has not officially denied building defense projects in the trust territories. We have no way of understanding Japan's facilities because our ships are not allowed to land. At this point, Mr. Mackie announced an editorial saying that the United States clearly has the right to protect its territories from aggression by Japan or any country.

<h3>Yamamoto Reports to Naval Officers on the Progress of the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>[Nanjing] At 9:00 this morning, Military Reduction Representative Lieutenant General Yamamoto visited Naval Minister Osumi, Chief of Staff Prince Fushimi, Deputy Minister Hasegawa, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Yoshida, Deputy Chief of the Naval General Staff Kato, and others at the Naval Minister's residence. Representative Yamamoto reported in detail on the progress of the London conference, explained the claims and intentions of Britain and the United States, and presented his opinions after making important suggestions on the British private plan. Japan's fundamental policy will never change. However, there is still considerable room for research when discussing specific cases. Although the military reduction negotiations have been agreed upon, there is no need to be pessimistic about the future. After the talks ended at 10:00, a military council meeting was held at the official residence again at 4:00 this afternoon, with Representative Yamamoto giving the same report and explanation.

<h3>Soviet Russia Devoted to Peace</h3>
<p>Japan Has Not Yet Agreed to Non-Aggression Pact</p>
<p>Russian Ambassador to the United States Delivers Speech</p>
<p>Philadelphia, USA. Soviet Russian Ambassador to the United States Troyanovsky delivered a speech at the Foreign Affairs Advisory Council here today, saying that Soviet Russia is still working tirelessly to conclude non-aggression treaties with militaristic countries. Mr. Tuo continued, saying that Soviet Russia has concluded such treaties with European neighbors and has also been constantly trying to get Japan to agree, but to date, it has had no effect. Tuo stated that the policy of non-aggression treaties in Soviet Russia is actually a positive action to establish lasting peace, because within such treaties, there are clear provisions for acts of aggression, and aggressors have nowhere to hide. Tuo finally said that the current Soviet Russia has abandoned the imperialist policy of aggression of the Tsarist Russian era, both in the East and the West. This is actually a great contribution to the world peace movement. (National Telegraph on the 13th)</p>

On that day, officials such as Vice Minister Shigemitsu, Counselor Yokotake, Director of the Commercial Bureau Kurisu, Director of the East Asia Bureau Kuwajima, and Director of the Information Bureau Amau will participate in order to discuss the specific plan for economic cooperation and to restore Sino-Japanese trade relations to normal. It is heard that the first steps to be discussed are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) To quell the anti-Japanese movement, (2) to stop the Sino-Japanese trade from being normal after the anti-Japanese movement, and to provide technical and capital assistance to China's restoration movement, including agricultural products such as cotton and wool, and to promote its large-scale purchase, this item must be increased, (3) When loan problems arise due to the suppression of bandits and the prevention of silver outflow, if China has any requests or hopes, they should be considered.

<p>[London] The House of Commons discussed the overall situation in the Far East this afternoon. Security Party member of parliament MacDoughall asked the Foreign Secretary whether he thought it appropriate to invite China, Japan, Russia, and other countries with ties to the Far East to hold a meeting, given that the ambiguity of the Mongol-Manchu border will endanger world peace. Foreign Secretary Simon replied that he believed that such a major incident was difficult to deal with in a Q&amp;A, but that he would use any power that could be used to stabilize peace in a very appropriate state.

He heard that the group was currently conducting similar inspections on the European continent. The results of the group's inspection in England will enable them to understand the British transportation methods and the value of British materials. When they return to their country, they will surely praise British business. (Reuters on the 13th)</p>

<p>[London] The House of Commons mentioned China's loss of its seat on the League of Nations Administrative Council. Conservative member of parliament Lunn asked how the government would try to dispel the impression that China's loss of this seat was because Britain ignored China's interests. Foreign Secretary Simon expressed surprise at the existence of this impression, saying that it was the League of Nations General Assembly that announced that China was not qualified to serve as an Administrative Council member. There is now no reason to say that the Western powers ignore China's interests. As for the Sino-Japanese talks, apart from hearing that they will handle the vast relationship between the two countries in the usual way, no accurate information has been received.

According to news obtained by the Korean government, on the night of the 12th, more than 200 members of the Sino-Korean Righteous Army crossed the Yalu River from Badaogou, Liaodong, and invaded North Pyongan Province in Korea. They crossed the border, broke through the guard team, and attacked Houchang. At dawn on the 13th, the Japanese army opened up a large team to respond. The Righteous Army, due to the disparity in numbers, retreated after obtaining many guns and bullets. Two members of the Japanese guard team were killed in this battle.

<h3>Japanese Budget Bill Passed by the House of Representatives Yesterday</h3>
<p>Political Warfare Center of Gravity Shifts to the House of Peers</p>
<p>[Tokyo] At this afternoon's plenary session of the House of Representatives, the government budget bill was finally approved. Before the vote, a major debate unfolded between the pro- and anti- factions, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. Among them, the most intense opposition came from Nakano, Kazami, Washizawa, Suzuki, and two others from the National League. All six claimed to be ill and did not attend the vote. This session of parliament can be said to have come to an end because the budget bill was passed. (Japan Alliance Telegraph on the 14th)</p>
<p>[Tokyo] The budget bill for this year was discussed at a meeting in the House of Representatives starting at 1:00 p.m. on the 14th. With the support of the political and civilian parties, it was passed by an absolute majority according to the original plan and immediately moved to the House of Peers. Therefore, the House of Peers is scheduled to convene a formal meeting at 10:00 a.m. on the 15th. First, Minister of Finance Takahashi will deliver a speech on the financial policy, and then questions will begin. People such as Takeo Kikuchi, So Ming Uzawa, Hojiro Aoki, and Dr. Sanji Mikami will force the government line. A budget general meeting will be convened from 1:00 p.m. Therefore, the stage for political warfare will shift to the House of Peers from now on. At the same time, in the House of Representatives, the hardliners of the Seiyukai failed in their argument for the return of the budget bill. In order to compensate, they will do their best to pursue the temporary income tax bill and the Keigyo problem, so the situation in the future cannot be taken lightly. On the government's side, efforts are being made to complete the countermeasures for both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives, and they are now working hard to plan their defense strategy.

<h3>Britain Will Propose Expanding the Scope of the Sky Convention at the Naval Conference</h3>
<p>China, Japan, the United States, and Russia Are All Among Those Invited</p>
<p>Protect Civilians from Bombing During Wartime</p>
<p>[London] Officials here indicated today that when the Ottawa naval conference is reopened, it may be proposed that the world's major powers conclude a convention to protect each other in the event of war. The countries invited to the convention will probably include Britain, the United States, China, Japan, and Russia. The content of the proposal is not detailed, but it is said to be roughly the same as the recently established Anglo-French agreement. The contracting countries will jointly prevent aerial attacks. The purpose of this agreement is to protect women, children, and innocent people from the dangers of aerial attacks. The Anglo-French agreement has been valued by the world's political circles, because the conditions of the Treaty of Versailles that prohibited Germany from reorganizing its military have been abolished by this agreement. The United States has not yet been invited to participate, probably because the American people do not like this kind of combination. However, European coordination is also highly valued by the American people, so if all countries in the world agree to protect each other, the United States may also be able to participate.

<h3>Lindbergh Kidnapping Case: Hauptmann Sentenced to Death</h3>
<p>To be Executed Within a Week After March 18th</p>
<p>Defense Attorney to File Appeal</p>
<p>Flemington – Bruno Hauptmann, the perpetrator in the Lindbergh baby kidnapping case, was sentenced to death by a jury today and will be executed on March 18th. The jury foreman, Mr. Watson, read the verdict stating that Hauptmann was guilty. Hauptmann stood still with a smile. The defense attorney, Mr. Reilly, was furious upon hearing the verdict and declared that he would appeal to the Supreme Court. The jury deliberated for eleven hours and twenty minutes before delivering the verdict at 10:44 PM. Lindbergh was not present in court. Prior to the announcement, military police cleared the courtroom of onlookers before bringing Hauptmann in. The jury, including four women, appeared pale and mentally exhausted when they retired at 10:35 PM. Hauptmann's wife was also in the audience. After the verdict, Hauptmann seemed confident of acquittal. Three days ago, he even told the press that he had won. Officials believe the guilty verdict is a major victory in the government's two-year campaign to eradicate kidnappers. Evidence against Hauptmann was collected through the collaboration of federal and state governments, making it no easy feat. Thus, even though Hauptmann claimed that the ransom money was given to him by his deceased friend, Mr. Fisch, he could not escape the law. Colonel Lindbergh's son was kidnapped on March 1, 1932, and murdered the same night. His body was found seventy-two days later, by which time Lindbergh had paid a ransom of $50,000. For two years, the government has been investigating the case until Hauptmann was arrested for attempting to use gold certificates that had been withdrawn from circulation. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>Flemington - Bruno Hauptmann, the suspect in the kidnapping of Colonel Lindbergh's young son, has been sentenced to death by a jury. After the foreman read the verdict, Judge Trenchard asked each of the other eleven jurors, one by one, in the same words, to which each juror replied in the same words, "The defendant is indeed guilty of first-degree murder." The courtroom was silent and filled with a deathly atmosphere. Each time a juror answered, Hauptmann would slightly shake his head and look at his wife, but his composure did not change. Judge Trenchard then decided that the execution would take place within a week after March 18th. If Hauptmann wishes to appeal, he has only three avenues: first, the New Jersey Supreme Court, and if rejected, then the Court of Errors and Appeals, and finally, the Court of Pardons, presided over by the Governor of New Jersey, as only the Court of Pardons has the power to commute a death sentence to life imprisonment, or to release a person serving a life sentence early. All these appellate bodies cannot begin to hear the case before May due to procedural reasons. Also, according to custom, prisoners sentenced to death are absolutely forbidden from speaking in prison, but this time Judge Trenchard has specifically allowed Hauptmann to talk to the jailers. The defense attorney, Mr. Reilly, is preparing an appeal, and believes that the prosecution presented by Judge Trenchard to the jury was biased and unfair, and will present thirty-two reasons to support the appeal. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<p>Flemington – After the court sentenced Bruno Hauptmann, the kidnapper of Colonel Lindbergh's son, to death, he has little hope left. This is because Judge Trenchard of this court is a highly respected legal elder of seventy-two years, and no case that he has judged has ever had the original verdict overturned on appeal. Furthermore, according to the speculation of Hauptmann's defense attorney, Hauptmann is penniless and it will be difficult to pursue an appeal. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Wealthy Enemies Framed My Son</h3>
<p>Heartfelt Words from a Seventy-Year-Old Mother</p>
<p>[Berlin] Hauptmann's mother, who is seventy years old and lives in Kamenz, Saxony, Germany, almost fainted today when she heard that her son had been sentenced to death. Later, with a sobbing voice, she told a Reuters reporter, "My son did not commit this brutal crime. The American authorities fabricated evidence and framed him. He is a poor child who is hated by the rich. How could he win? Now, the only hope lies in Attorney Reilly, who will file an appeal." (Reuters Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>Death of Renowned British Sinologist Herbert Giles</h3>

<h3>British Mediation Eases Tensions Between Italy and Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Establishment of a Demilitarized Border Zone</p>
<p>Negotiations Between the Two Countries Have Not Reached an Understanding</p>
<p>[Rome] The clouds of war between Italy and Abyssinia seemed to dissipate slightly today. Government officials from both countries met throughout the day, apparently with some results, which eased the serious situation somewhat. After the Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Suvich, met with the Abyssinian Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Mr. Yessous, Mr. Yessous declared, "Abyssinian troops have not invaded the border of Italian Somaliland. All disturbances are caused by nomadic tribes who are not under the control of the Abyssinian government." Subsequently, Mr. Suvich and Mr. Yessous expressed hope that the events between the two countries could be resolved without bloodshed. At the same time, however, the war preparations of both countries continued. More than 30,000 Italian troops remained on standby in Florence and Milan. Prime Minister Mussolini personally convened the Supreme Defense Council to discuss the Abyssinian issue in detail. On the Abyssinian side, the government announced that it hoped the League of Nations could mediate and avoid war, but it would be difficult to accept the demands to salute the Italian people and pay compensation of 5 million yuan. It is learned that meetings will still be held in the capitals of both countries in an attempt to avoid conflict between the two countries. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>[Rome] Various countries are now actively engaged in diplomatic negotiations to resolve the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. The main negotiations are taking place in the Abyssinian capital, with the Abyssinian Prince and the Italian Minister consulting. On the other hand, the Abyssinian Chargé d'Affaires in Italy, Mr. Yessous, met with the Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Suvich, and was received by Prime Minister Mussolini. During the meeting with Mr. Suvich, he stated that the military measures taken by Italy so far were only precautionary. It is generally believed that the resolution of this dispute will likely involve the establishment of a neutral zone at the border between Abyssinia and the Italian East African colonies, and the dispatch of a joint commission by the two countries to determine responsibility for the incident. (Havas Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Abyssinian Chargé d'Affaires visited Italian Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Suvich, this afternoon and was received by Mr. Suvich for about an hour. There was no official news release about the content of the talks or the results of the negotiations, but according to sources, there is still no concrete agreement on the possibility of establishing a neutral zone between Italy and Abyssinia to prevent the situation from becoming more complicated. However, Italian political circles have repeatedly stated that the Italian government only wants a peaceful resolution, but it is still a question whether the Abyssinian Emperor has sufficient authority to prohibit his subordinates from looting and killing.

<h3>Simon Reports to the House of Commons</h3>
<p>Both Armies Maintain Original Positions</p>
<p>Direct Negotiations Underway</p>
<p>[London] Foreign Secretary Simon spoke in the House of Commons today about the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, stating that the British Ambassador to Rome learned that after a conflict occurred in the Somaliland border area, the Italian government mobilized two army divisions, totaling 30,000 troops, in Italy. The British Ambassador also learned that the Italian government's plan was not to abandon direct negotiations with Abyssinia in order to achieve a peaceful resolution. According to recent news, Italian troops have not advanced further from their positions in the disputed area, and the Italian Minister to Abyssinia has been instructed to negotiate with the Abyssinian government. The British government has also instructed the British Minister to Abyssinia, Mr. Barton, to do his best to mediate and ensure the success of these negotiations. Reports that Italy had sent an ultimatum to Abyssinia have been denied by the authorities. However, the Italian government lodged a protest with the Abyssinian government after the recent border incident and reserved the right to seek compensation. As for Abyssinia, it is complying with its January 19th document to the League of Nations and has strictly ordered its frontline troops not to cause further incidents. (Reuters Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>Germany Drafts Reply to Anglo-French Proposals</h3>
<p>To Be Sent to the British and French Governments and Published Simultaneously</p>
<p>[Berlin] People are currently awaiting Germany's reply to the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3rd. This reply will be sent by the German government to the British and French Ambassadors to Germany this Thursday or Friday, who will then forward it to the British and French governments. The full text of the reply has been drafted and is currently awaiting approval from Prime Minister Hitler. It will probably not be published immediately in Berlin, but will be announced simultaneously after agreement with Britain and France. The tone of the reply is likely to be very moderate, but the wording will be mostly vague and non-committal. The German government intends to avoid two difficulties and therefore has to use ambiguous language. Firstly, the people of other countries are trying to unite to seek peace, and Germany does not want to give the impression of passively not participating. Secondly, because the political situation in various countries is very unstable, Germany wants to avoid being subject to basic constraints, so as to wait for the right moment to act. The German government is paying close attention to the internal political changes in Britain, France, Russia, and other countries. The recent conflict between Italy and Abyssinia has been met with calm by Germany, as if it were unrelated to Germany. In fact, this is a deliberate attempt to conceal the situation from foreign powers, as Italy's colonial conflict inevitably reduces its freedom of action in European politics. Those with discerning eyes know this. In addition, Germany seems to want to misinterpret the London Declaration as a preliminary recognition of Germany's right to rearm, and even if the London Declaration does not immediately recognize Germany's right to rearm, at least the powers will no longer strongly oppose it. Therefore, Germany can take advantage of the opportunity to gain more advantages. The longer the negotiations are delayed, the more Germany's military will expand. Moreover, it is worth noting that the most influential people in Germany have now taken a further step. The most influential members of the Nazi Party, such as Alfred Rosenberg, the director of the Nazi Party's Foreign Affairs Bureau, who is greatly relied upon by Hitler, are now reviving the famous theory of former Vice-Chancellor Papen, advocating that European countries unite to conquer Soviet Russia. It is hoped that this proposition will gain the sympathy of some people in Britain. From this, it can be seen that influential elements in Germany have various plans, and their power is difficult to predict. However, on the eve of the delivery of Germany's reply, we may as well elaborate on it. (Havas Telegram, 14th)</p>
<h3>British Labour Party Moves to Impeach Government for Ineffective Handling of Unemployment Problem</h3>
<p>Minister of Labour Resigns in Protest</p>
<p>[London] The Labour Party will introduce a motion of impeachment against the government in the House of Commons today, accusing the government of ineffective handling of the unemployment problem. At the same time, Chancellor of the Exchequer Chamberlain will represent the government to conclude the debate on this issue. People are wondering why the Chancellor is taking this action, as London's financial markets have been unsettled since the rumours of an imminent general election surfaced last week. It is said that the Chancellor will make a statement to reassure the public, as foreigners are currently selling securities in London. However, rumours of unrest over restrictions on unemployment benefits have not subsided. Minister of Labour Stanley has resigned, and although he has been persuaded to stay, it is uncertain whether he will accept. If Mr. Stanley does resign, the cabinet may not be reshuffled because the 25th anniversary of the King's ascension to the throne is approaching, so some people advocate reorganizing the cabinet after the anniversary celebrations.

<h3>Injection of Liquid Enhances Coal Combustion Power</h3>
<p>New Japanese Invention</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Fuel is an important national policy, and it is also the focus of parliamentary debate. This time, Mr. Takeichi Goro, a merchant in Tokyo, has invented a liquid that, when injected into coal, causes the coal powder, which originally had very little heat, to suddenly generate intense combustion with extremely strong heat. It has been successfully tested. If this liquid is used, the value of one ton of coal can be reduced by four yen, which is very economical. Based on the current fuel consumption, it can save 45 million yen per year. The Navy, the Ministry of Railways, various shipping companies, and factories will regard this as a revolution in the fuel industry, which is very noteworthy.

<h3>Shooting by Taiwanese Against Police Occurs in Xiamen</h3>
<p>The location is in a Taiwanese-operated gambling den.</p>
<p>Dozens of shots fired, injuring one passerby.</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: Tian Songmei, a squad leader of the armed police patrol team of the Xiamen Public Security Bureau, and six others were resting in front of No. 5 Kaiyuan Road (i.e., Fuyu) on the evening of the 9th on their bicycles. Outside the foreign company was a coffee shop, and the upper floor in the back was a gambling den operated by Taiwanese. Not long after the armed police rested, the upper floor suddenly opened fire and shot at them, five shots in a row. Wang Xiuxian, the squad leader of the walking armed police team, immediately led several armed police to rush to the scene upon hearing the news. The upper floor fired several more shots, all aimed at the armed police and the patrol team. The armed police patrol team did not return fire. Upon being informed, the Second Branch immediately dispatched Inspector Zhao Guanghou to lead a special team to stop them. The upper floor continued to fire 60 to 70 shots. Tian Songmei and Wang Xiuxian arrested four people at the Fuxing gambling den: one was Guo Jinsheng from Siming, and three were Su Ben, Su Liu, and Su Mu, all from Haicheng. Later, Jiang Jun, a Taiwanese, was also arrested at the Fuxing gambling den. All were taken to the Second Branch. Guo Jinsheng and the other four claimed that they were drinking tea at the Mingxing Tea House next to the Fuxing gambling den and were mistakenly arrested. Jiang Jun was the accountant of the Fuxing Foreign Company and was arrested when he returned to the Fuxing gambling den after visiting a friend on Chenguang Road. All were sent to the General Bureau. According to a report from the Criminal Investigation Team of the Public Security Bureau, the shooting occurred on the upper floor of the Fuxing Foreign Company at No. 5 Kaiyuan Road at 9:35 PM. The reason was that Jiang Jun and another Taiwanese person inexplicably held handguns and fired into the street in front of the building for fun. Feng Lin, the guard policeman of the Second Branch, and the armed police and patrol team went forward to stop them. The shooters did not listen, but instead said bad words and fired a shot at the armed police before entering the Mingxing Tea House. Then, they rushed out and walked into the Fuxing Foreign Company. At that time, several shots were fired from the second floor of Fuxing, and the third floor also fired in response. For a time, the sound of gunfire was loud, with a total of 60 to 70 shots fired, all aimed at the armed police and the patrol team on the street. The armed police and others also fired several shots into the sky. In front of the Kaiyuan Inn across from Fuxing, a passerby named Li Gu was shot in the foot, and a pool of blood formed. He was helped away by his companions. The armed police and patrol team saw the shooting from the upper floor and, ignoring the opposition, bravely went upstairs and arrested Jiang Jun and five others. At that time, the Japanese Police Substation of the Japanese Consulate also sent people to suppress the situation. The upper floor fired three more shots before stopping. It is said that the reason for the Taiwanese shooting for no reason was that the patrol team was resting in front of Fuxing, and the owner of the gambling den believed that the presence of the police at the door prevented gamblers from entering, which hindered his business, so he shot and threatened them, wanting to urge the police to leave. Later, seeing that the police did not leave, but instead came to stop them, they became angry and fired straight ahead. The Fuyu area is where many tea houses and inns where singing girls gather are located, and it is very lively at night. As a result of the shooting lasting for thirty minutes, passersby were shocked and fled, and shops closed their doors, causing great chaos. Afterwards, the Taiwanese side claimed that electric sparklers were set off upstairs, and the armed police fired shots and destroyed the Fuxing gambling den, instigating the Japanese consulate to lodge a negotiation. However, as of the 10th, the Japanese consul had only taken back Jiang Jun, the Taiwanese person, and there was no other movement. (February 13)</p>

<p>The Anti-Smoking Committee Thoroughly Investigates Unlicensed Smoking</p>
<p>The First Branch of the Tinglin Public Security Bureau recently arrested six people, including Wang Helin, for unlicensed smoking and transferred them to the County Anti-Smoking Committee for interrogation. Wang Helin and others stated that they smoked at the Fuji smoking sales shop in Hougang, believing that Yang Ruifu, the manager of the sales shop, had violated the regulations. The Bureau was ordered to summon Yang Ruifu to the case. Yesterday, Yao Naiqian, the secretary of the County Anti-Smoking Committee, held a hearing and interrogated him. However, Yang Ruifu flatly denied that he had been framed by Wang Helin and others, claiming that he had always complied with the regulations and did not sell to unlicensed smokers, and asked for an investigation. Secretary Yao then ruled that since both sides had their own stories, there was suspicion, and ordered that the case be transferred to the County Government for investigation.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Police Officer Assaults Firefighters</p>
<p>The situation escalates, the whole city goes on strike</p>
<p>The Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau of this city and the Beiyi Fire Brigade in Butang Lane had a conflict due to a false fire alarm caused by catching gamblers. The Beiyi Fire Brigade, the Ninth Branch of the Merchant Corps, and the Da'anzhen Township Office were all destroyed, and the miscellaneous items in the Fifth Branch were also damaged by idlers, resulting in a strike. The twelve fire engines, both motorized and hand-operated, were hired by the Firefighting Federation to be dragged to the brigade and parked inside, awaiting mediation by party and government agencies. This has already been noted in this newspaper. It is now learned that County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, in order to resolve the dispute as soon as possible, in addition to ordering all the police officers of the Fifth Branch to return to their posts, also donated 100 yuan of his salary to reward the police officers of the Bureau, and Police Chief Chen also rewarded the entire police force with 60 yuan, stipulating that each police chief would be rewarded with 3.5 silver dollars, each police officer with 2 yuan, and each firefighter with 1.5 yuan. Police Chief Chen also summoned all the police officers to give a speech, and the strike came to an end. However, because the fire brigades had not achieved a satisfactory result, they were unwilling to take back the motorized and hand-operated fire engines parked in the Federation. Yesterday (the 14th) at around 2 AM, a fire suddenly broke out at the home of Li Jiazong, a resident of Nancangmen outside the East Gate. The Beishisanduan Fire Brigade immediately sounded the steel gong alarm. However, because the fire brigades had a dispute with the Fifth Branch and had not been resolved, they did not come to the scene to put out the fire. Only the fire dragon of this section pumped water to put out the fire, but it was a drop in the bucket and did not help, causing the fire to spread to the left and right neighbors. For a time, order was disrupted, and the sound of crying was heart-wrenching. It took about an hour of burning before the fire was extinguished. In total, several shops were burned down, including a pancake shop, a dumpling shop, a barbershop, and a tiger stove shop, with dozens of houses and heavy losses. When the fire was raging, some firefighters went to the gate of the Public Security Bureau on Sanhuang Street and rang the gong, suddenly having an argument with the guards at the gate of the Public Security Bureau, followed by a conflict. The situation was tense, and the police officers fired two blank shots as a warning and took five firefighters who were leading the way into custody. Meanwhile, Police Chief Chen ordered all personnel of the Bureau to be on alert, and a temporary curfew was declared within fifty or sixty steps of the Public Security Bureau. The area under Hongni Bridge was maintained by plainclothes detectives of the Criminal Investigation Team, Chief Wu of Political Affairs Police, and Chief Zhong of Criminal Investigation. Members of the fire brigades from various sections heard that the firefighters had been detained and rushed to ring the gong everywhere, gathering hundreds of people and heading to the Public Security Bureau to demand their release. The Firefighting Federation learned of this and sent staff member Gu Hesheng to the General Bureau to meet with Police Chief Chen and Inspector Wang, where both sides stated what had happened. The detainees were Zhou Fuquan of Beiyi, Sun Meigen of Beisan, Dong Jingen of Beiliu, Wang Anan of Beishier, and Wang Awu of Beishisan. They were handed over to Mr. Gu to be released. However, Wang Awu, Sun Meigen, and others were beaten on their right legs, heads, backs, right chests, etc., with the butts of guns, and were sent to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Their injuries were serious and their lives were in danger. The merchants of this city, because the fire brigades did not put out the fire, had lost their protection, so starting at 8 AM, all the shops in the city went on strike, and the strike was difficult to resolve. The city was in a state of panic. At 11 AM, Yang Hanxi, Qian Sunqing, Cai Rongsan, Chen Zhanru, Cheng Jingtang, Zhang Fulin, Zhao Zixin, Qian Zhongliang, etc., from the Joint Chamber of Commerce paid a visit to County Magistrate Yan to discuss a solution, explaining that the firefighters had three requests: (1) Wu Zhengrong, Chief of Political Affairs Police of the County Government, would send the twelve fire engines parked at the Firefighting Federation back to the respective fire brigades with red silk. (2) The losses of the Beiyi section and the damaged parts of the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau would be borne by each party, and a resolution would be made later. (3) Chen Yuchu, the County Public Security Bureau Chief, whose handling of affairs was hasty and inappropriate, would be dismissed. If the above three measures could be taken, the strike might not escalate. As a result, County Magistrate Yan expressed acceptance of points one and two, and the third point would be submitted to the province for approval. However, the County Chamber of Commerce must first diligently guide all industries to resume business to avoid losses. Mr. Yang and others agreed to first persuade them to resume business. The injured firefighters Wang Awu and Sun Meigen and six others submitted to the local branch hospital for an examination of their injuries. The Public Security Bureau also telegraphed the province to request instructions on how to handle the situation and deployed the Water Patrol Team to the Bureau for defense. At the same time, Yang Hanxi, Chairman of the Merchant Corps, issued an order to all merchant corps in the county to arm themselves and patrol the streets in this extraordinary period. The County Party Department, the County Chamber of Commerce, and the Firefighting Federation issued an urgent notice, setting a temporary emergency meeting at 2 PM to discuss how to resolve the matter. Cheng Jingtang, Jiang Daoshan, Cai Yourong, Shi Qinglin, Miao Dongchen, Zhang Hanzheng, Gong Haiqin, and sixty or seventy others attended. Zhao Zixin chaired the meeting. First, Cheng Jingtang, Qian Zhongliang, Cai Yourong, and other representatives who went to the County Government reported on their meeting with County Magistrate Yan Shenyu. Then, they discussed the solution. (1) In the case of the Beiyi Fire Brigade and the Fifth Branch of the Public Security Bureau, the Chief of Political Affairs Police Wu Zhengrong would follow the County Magistrate's goodwill and send the fire engines back to the fire brigade. (2) The Chamber of Commerce would work with the Party Department and the Chamber of Commerce to persuade all industries to open for business and maintain local security. (3) The County Public Security Bureau's detention of firefighters without cause would be reported to the County Government for handling with the injured reports of each section. After the discussion, the meeting was adjourned. Police Chief Wu immediately ordered the political police to send the fire dragons to their respective fire brigade temples. Yang Hanxi, Cai Rongsan, Chen Zhanru, Qian Sunqing, and representatives of the County Chamber of Commerce, and Zhao Zixin, Cheng Jingtang, Cai Yourong, Jiang Daoshan, etc., from the Firefighting Federation, set out to persuade the merchants to open for business. Yang Fenglou, a police officer injured by the County Public Security Bureau, submitted to the local branch hospital for an examination of his injuries. After Chief Prosecutor Qian held a court session to examine the injury marks, he ordered them to be sent back. The Beiyi Fire Brigade also filed a criminal lawsuit with the court yesterday regarding the destroyed parts. The County Party Department also convened a temporary emergency talk at around 3 PM, attended by County Magistrate Yan Shenyu and local figures Feng Yunchu, Jiang Daoshan, Qian Sunqing, Shi Qinglin, Qian Zhongliang, and more than a dozen others. Xu Chizi, a member of the Standing Committee of the County Party Department, chaired the meeting. First, the chairman reported the significance of the meeting, stating that the primary issue at present was to persuade all industries to open for business and resume operations, and that the parts concerning injuries and damages would be discussed later. Everyone agreed. The meeting was adjourned. At the same time, the County Party Department telegraphed the Provincial Party Department, requesting that it forward a letter to the Provincial Government, requesting that it send a senior official to Wuxi as soon as possible to impartially mediate the case, so as to avoid further escalation of the strike. The County Party Department also convened the Provincial-Wuxi Teachers College and junior high schools and other schools of boy scouts to form a temporary team to take on defense, patrol, intelligence, and sentry duties to maintain local security. The County Security Brigade Headquarters issued an emergency order, ordering the first, second, and third squadrons to send teams to patrol overnight to prevent accidents. County Magistrate Yan Shenyu, the mediation of the case has come to an end, and he immediately used a long-distance telephone to inform the Civil Affairs Department of the Provincial Government and request instructions on how to handle the matter.</p>

<p>Industrial Exhibition According to a spokesperson for the Swiss Consulate to the reporter, the industrial exhibition to be held in Basel will feature the most exquisite products from various manufacturers in the country. Switzerland is an industrial country, and its foreign trade is mainly in industrial products, so the progress in craftsmanship is extremely rapid.

<p>Welcome to Visit The Swiss authorities have instructed their consulates in various countries to be responsible for liaising with the host countries regarding visits to the exhibition. Guidance and great convenience will be provided for travel and accommodation after arrival.

It is currently being negotiated by the consulate in Shanghai whether China will send a group to participate at that time, it is said.</p>

After reporting to the Ministry of Railways for record, the company received an official letter from the ministry yesterday approving the termination. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Contracting Process</p>
<p>Last year, after the establishment of the illegal organization in the puppet state, which took control of the section of the Beining Railway from Shenyang to Shanhaiguan and established the Fengshan Railway Bureau, traffic between inside and outside the pass was blocked. Later, due to the needs of the situation, both China and Japan, in order to maintain traffic, after several consultations, decided that a third party should come forward to contract the through train service while avoiding recognition of the puppet organization in principle. At that time, the Chinese government greatly favored the China Travel Service to come forward to handle it. After repeated urging by the Ministry of Railways, the company reluctantly agreed to participate and organized the Oriental Travel Agency to undertake the arduous task. It was ordered to start contracting the Peiping-Shenyang through train service from July 1st, but because this matter was of great importance, it was unwilling to be permanently responsible and agreed with the Ministry of Railways to conduct a pilot operation for six months, which would end immediately. By the end of last December, the contracting matter had expired. The company's board of directors reported to the Ministry of Railways, requesting that it stop participating and handle the termination in accordance with the agreement. Yesterday, the company received an official letter from the Ministry of Railways approving the record and termination. According to Mr. Chen Xiangtao, manager of the company, to a reporter from Dagongbao, our company's participation in the contracting of the through train service has come to an end. After the termination of the Oriental Travel Agency, the problem of through train service between Peiping and Shenyang will be handled by the government. It is not yet known whether another organization will be formed. Our company has been operating the through train service for six months and is fortunate to have done so without any faults to the people, he said.</p>
<p>Notice of Termination</p>
<p>The Shanghai China Travel Service headquarters issued a notice of termination yesterday, which stated: "Notice: Our company was ordered to participate in the organization of the Oriental Travel Agency from July 1st last year, and it was agreed to conduct a pilot operation for six months, which expired at the end of last year. We reported to the Ministry of Railways, stating that we would stop participating in accordance with the agreement from January 1st this year and requested a record to be terminated. We have now received the Ministry of Railways' official letter No. 2691, approving the record, etc. Our company has completely terminated the case of participating in the Oriental Travel Agency. We hereby declare this, and we hope you will take note."</p>
<h3>Nanjing Road Citizens' Association Opposes Telephone Rate Increase</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company has recently requested the Shanghai Municipal Council to approve an increase in user telephone rates.

A military band will participate in playing music.</p>
<p>Newspapers Publish Special Issue</p>
<p>The association believes that the anniversary of the New Life Movement should be widely publicized so that the people everywhere can universally implement it. Since Shanghai is the center of the country, any actions taken will inspire the people in the interior to follow suit. Therefore, the association has planned to ask the newspapers in the city to add a special issue on the New Life Movement on that day to promote it and facilitate leadership.</p>
<h3>Neon Sign</h3>
<p>In order to attract the attention of the entire city and to encourage all sectors to implement the New Life Movement, the association has invited experts to plan and design a neon sign, which has been commissioned to Daming Hongguang Factory. It will be located in front of Mr. Chen Yintu's Memorial Tower on Fangbang Bridge at the West Gate. The iron frame is 36 feet high, and the sign is very eye-catching. The New Life logo is placed on top, covering an area of 35 square feet.

It is expected to be installed and completed by the end of the month. When it is lit up, it will be visible in the area near the West Gate, it is said.</p>
<h3>Completion of the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou Line of the Nine-Province Telephone Network</h3>
<p>Currently Measuring the Shanghai-Hankou and Other Four Lines</p>
<p>800,000 Yuan in Funding Has Been Allocated by the State</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports: The long-distance telephone network of the nine provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Henan, Shandong, Hubei, Hunan, and Hebei, which is being constructed by the Ministry of Communications, has completed the surveying and erection of poles for the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou lines. The surveying of the Shanghai-Hankou, Beijing-Tianjin, Pinghan, and Longhai lines is currently underway. The Ministry of Communications sent Chen Gengfa, Chief of Engineering for the Shanghai-Hankou Line, to Hankou to survey the route between Hankou and Qiupu, and Li Guohua, Chief of Engineering for the Qingpu Line, to survey the route between Qiupu and Nanjing. Both men have now completed their route surveying work and are currently carrying out measurement work. Once the measurement is completed, pole erection and wire laying will begin. It is said that the Beijing-Tianjin line will be erected from Tianjin in the north, and the Tianjin-Jinan section and the Qiupu-Nanjing section will be completed first. The Jinan-Xuzhou-Bengbu-Beijing sections are expected to be surveyed and construction will begin this year. The Ministry of Communications has specially sent Liu Songchou, a long-distance telephone administrator, to Xuzhou to inspect the telephone between Xuzhou and Haizhou and to visit Lianyungang for inspection. According to both men to the Huadong News Agency reporter, the Ministry of Communications will set up a general line station at the Tianjin-Longhai junction of the long-distance telephone in Xuzhou. As for the total cost, it has been approved by the Executive Yuan to use the state's second reserve fund, totaling 800,000 yuan. The entire completion of the call period must be realized after two years, it is said.</p>
<h3>Li Yingcong Returned to Shanghai from Nanjing Yesterday</h3>
<p>Will Fly to Xinjiang Soon to Meet Sheng</p>
<p>Huadong News Agency reports: Li Jingcong, General Manager of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, returned to Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday. A reporter from the Huadong News Agency made a special trip to the company to interview him. Secretary Zha Zhenhu received the reporter in his place. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Li Sheng's Telegram</p>
<p>According to Secretary Zha, Manager Li arrived in Shanghai this morning (yesterday). The report that Manager Li went to Xinjiang to plan the restoration of the Shanghai-Xinjiang air route is a misrepresentation. As for the restoration of the Shanghai-Xinjiang air route, this matter is also very complicated. At the end of last year, Sheng Shicai, the governor of Xinjiang Province, sent a telegram to Manager Li, stating that Xinjiang Province planned to independently manage the Hami-Tacheng section of the air route and inquired about the company's opinion. After receiving the telegram, Li considered the matter to be serious and did not reply without authorization. He then forwarded it to Zhu Jiahua, Minister of Communications, to ask for instructions. Subsequently, the Ministry of Communications approved him to temporarily operate on his own. Manager Li also telegraphed the opinion of the Ministry of Communications to Governor Sheng, asking him to prepare as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Flying to Xinjiang Soon</p>
<p>Secretary Zha continued, "At the beginning of this month, Governor Sheng sent another telegram, requesting the company to extend the air route to Hami by the end of this month so that the aircraft independently prepared by Xinjiang Province can connect and fly to Tacheng, and instructed to quickly set up a Hami office." After reading the telegram, Li considered the procedures for this matter to be very important and did not agree hastily. He then telegraphed Sheng in Xinjiang to inquire about the method of transportation and all the procedures. A reply is expected within days. Once it arrives, Manager Li will fly to Xinjiang in person to negotiate, he said.</p>

<h3>Hydrographic Bureau Assists in Surveying and Dredging the Shentan, Starting in Early April</h3>
<p>The Tai Dredger Will Arrive in Shanghai at the End of Next Month</p>
<p>The Ship's Crew Is Stipulated to Be 70 People</p>
<p>The Location of the Shoal Belongs to Tongsha and Guansha</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports: The General Dredging Bureau ordered the world's largest dredger from the Schichau Shipyard in Germany, which set sail to China on the 8th of this month, with an estimated voyage of two months, as has been reported in the newspapers. A Datong News Agency reporter made a special trip to visit Dr. Chadley, Chief Engineer of the Bureau, yesterday morning and learned that the ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of next month, and that the surveying of the Shentan has already begun. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Shoal Names Tongsha and Guansha</p>
<p>Regarding the dredging of the Shentan outside the Wusongkou, due to the scale of the project, the Hydrographic Bureau of the Ministry of the Navy is providing assistance with surveying. The survey has now been completed. The location of the shoal is actually southeast of the Shentan, and its place names are Tongsha and Guansha, which is the center of the Yangtze River estuary, 20 English miles from the mouth of the Yangtze River and 30 English miles from the Wusongkou. After completing the survey, the Hydrographic Bureau has drawn and printed detailed maps for the Dredging Bureau to refer to when the dredging project begins.</p>
<p>Crew Set at 70 People</p>
<p>Regarding the Havas dispatch about the departure of the large dredger to China, which was reported in the newspapers yesterday morning, Mr. Zha said that there were some discrepancies. Regarding the crew of the ship, after arriving in Shanghai, the four or five crew members sent by the Schichau Shipyard are still planning to be retained as skilled workers, not all Chinese workers. However, in addition to these four or five people, the quota for crew members is stipulated to be 70 people, and the remaining 60 or so people will be all Chinese, he said. The amount of sand, stone, and mud that can be excavated daily is approximately 20,000 cubic meters, not 25,000 cubic meters. The above-mentioned dredging will start in early April.</p>
<p>The large dredger is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of next month, so the dredging project of Tongsha and Guansha outside the Wusongkou will likely begin in early April. According to Mr. Zha's research, the mud quality there is no different from the mud quality in the Huangpu River, except that it is slightly slippery. The stipulated dredging length is 20 English miles, and a width of only 1,000 feet is sufficient. It was previously said that there were also plans to widen it to 20 English miles, but that was a reporter's misunderstanding, he said.</p>
<h3>Chen Xian Geng and Three Others Went to Anhui Qiaole Village Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Industrial Association, the Nanjing Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, in order to seek relief for the displaced overseas Chinese, has specially selected Shuiyang Town, Xuancheng County, Anhui Province, to develop Qiaole Village, so that the overseas Chinese can support themselves and not become starving corpses. Overseas Chinese in Shanghai have all applied for registration with the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission. The first batch of six people have already received their permits. The Industrial Association reporter learned that overseas Chinese Chen Xian Geng, along with his wife Chen Qingzhi, and Yao Sanhui and two others, took the Shanghai-Nanjing train to Nanjing last night, then transferred to a ship to Wuhu, and then to Xuancheng to claim land for cultivation. The remaining overseas Chinese have not yet secured travel funds, so the date of their departure to Xuancheng has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Ma Xiaochun, Standing Committee Member of the Kunming Chamber of Commerce, Discusses Yunnan's Commercial Situation</h3>
<p>Foreign Goods Flood the Market, Urgent Need to Promote Domestic Products</p>
<p>Scheduled to Depart for Yunnan on the 20th to Participate in the National Exhibition</p>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, Mr. Ma Xiaochun, Standing Committee Member of the Kunming Chamber of Commerce in Yunnan Province, came to Shanghai to arrange everything for the preparation of the Yunnan National Exhibition and is scheduled to return to Yunnan on the 20th of this month to attend the opening ceremony of the National Exhibition. The Shen Shi News Agency reporter visited Mr. Ma at his residence yesterday and was informed of the following:</p>
<p>Mission to Shanghai</p>
<p>According to Mr. Ma, Yunnan Province is remote due to inconvenient transportation, and its commerce has been little developed as a result, leading to a flood of foreign goods in the market. Before the September 18th Incident, Japanese goods almost dominated the Yunnan market. After that, due to the boycott movement, Japanese goods decreased, but because of Kunming's proximity to Annam (Vietnam), French goods replaced Japanese goods. This phenomenon is very worrying. The Department of Industry has therefore taken measures to hold national product exhibitions and establish national product companies in order to develop the national product market and recover lost profits. As for the global economic recession, because Yunnan is remote, the impact on commerce has been minimal.</p>
<p>Scheduled Return to Yunnan</p>
<p>Yunnan's industry is still in the extremely nascent stage of handicrafts, barely enough for self-sufficiency. In terms of education, the province has one university, more than ten middle schools, and seventy or eighty elementary schools, but popular education is very developed, which is a special and good phenomenon. My visit here is to arrange for the Yunnan National Products Exhibition and the collection of goods for the National Products Company. Methods have been established with the China National Products Production and Sales Cooperation Association. The goods for participation have already been shipped and have now arrived in Kunming. I am scheduled to leave Shanghai on the 20th of this month in order to attend the opening ceremony of the exhibition.</p>

<p>Regarding Chen's Report on the Financial Situation in Sichuan Province</p>
<p>Chen Shao Gui, the Special Commissioner of Finance for Sichuan Province, was ordered last year to enter Sichuan to assist Liu Xiang, Chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, in reorganizing the province's finances. It is now learned that Mr. Chen arrived in Shanghai via Nanjing the night before last to pay his respects to Minister Kong and report on the recent financial situation in Sichuan Province and to request instructions on the reorganization plan. Mr. Chen will stay in Shanghai for at most one week before returning to Sichuan. It is also learned that the Sichuan authorities, in order to reorganize old debts and adjust local finances, requested the Ministry of Finance to approve the issuance of 120 million yuan in long-term public bonds. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance has responded, stating that the amount of the public bonds is too large and the collateral is insufficient, and has instructed them to reduce the amount and submit it again for review.</p>
<h3>Qinghai Islamic Promotion Association Requests Donations of Books</h3>

<p>Ma Lin, Ma Buqing, and other patrons of the Qinghai Islamic Promotion Association, as well as Ma Bufang, Ma Shaowu, and other responsible personnel of the reorganized association, in view of the fact that the great powers are casting covetous eyes on the country and the national crisis is severe, want to develop the Northwest and consolidate the border regions.

<h3>The Cigarette Industry Association Submits Proposals for Relief of the Cigarette Industry</h3>
<p>Submitted to the Tax Office Yesterday for Forwarding to the Ministry of Finance for Adoption</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Cigarette Factory Industry Association, because the cigarette industry in our country is declining day by day, yesterday submitted a proposal to the Tax Office for forwarding to the Ministry of Finance, requesting its adoption and implementation. The original text is as follows: We hereby report that the cigarette industry, from October 1, 1930, to the end of March 1931, within the scope of the unified tax area, the average monthly sales of machine-made cigarettes was 102,408 cases (50,000 cigarettes per case). Since the increase in the cigarette tax rate in January 1932, the monthly average number, up to the end of December 1933, has dropped to 90,450 cases (50,000 cigarettes per case). From December 5, 1933, to October 1934, the tax rate was increased again, and the number dropped to 78,358 cases (50,000 cigarettes per case). The above-mentioned decline is partly due to the business environment, such as the economic recession and the decline in the value of copper coins, which have reduced the purchasing power of the general public. However, these are only indirect reasons. The main points of its non-connection are as follows: (1) The tax rate on machine-made cigarettes is too far from the tax rate on hand-made cigarettes. (2) The development of hand-made cigarette manufacturing and sales within the tax zone. (3) The reason for the development of hand-made cigarettes is that the government collects taxes on hand-made cigarettes regardless of grade, averaging 10 yuan per 50,000 cigarettes. This tax rate is only one-eighth of the lowest tax rate for machine-made cigarettes. The evasion of taxes cannot be stopped, and the sales of illicit cigarettes are increasing day by day. Machine-made cigarettes are the biggest reason for the decline in business. When the regulations restricting hand-made cigarettes were promulgated in 1930, the business of hand-made cigarettes was limited to Bengbu in Anhui and Xuzhou in Henan, small towns in remote areas. But now, Anhui, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, Jiangxi, and other provinces and towns are all over the place. According to rough calculations, the average daily sales of hand-made cigarettes is about 20,000 cases (50,000 cigarettes per case). In terms of tax revenue, machine-made cigarette merchants have suffered huge losses due to the development of hand-made cigarettes, and the tax revenue collected by the government from hand-made cigarettes is actually equal to zero. From our experience, the current cigarette tax rate regulations can indeed promote the development of hand-made cigarette business. Not only that, hand-made cigarettes often counterfeit the registered trademarks of machine-made cigarettes, and this has become even more serious recently. The current laws on the punishment of counterfeiting trademarks and the protection of registered trademarks are not sufficient to prohibit such behavior in practice. In order to relieve the machine-made cigarette business and maintain the government's tax revenue, we respectfully submit the following suggestions as far as our humble opinions can reach: (1) Increase the tax rate on hand-made cigarettes to be equal to the lowest tax rate for machine-made cigarettes, or issue a separate law that prohibits the manufacture of cigarettes unless by legally registered manufacturers, and must be strictly enforced, and counterfeit trademarks should be punished. Special attention should be paid to the above-mentioned hand-made cigarette areas. (2) Formulate strict implementation measures for the regulations restricting the import of cigarette paper, so that all illegally tax-evaded cigarettes cannot be manufactured. (3) Strictly supervise the collection agencies for the unified tobacco leaf tax to prevent tax-evading tobacco leaves from flooding everywhere and being used by hand-made cigarette manufacturers. (4) Expand the powers of the Cigarette Smuggling Suppression Committee so that it can fully implement smuggling suppression. For example, comparing the tobacco leaf tax in the Zhengzhou area of Henan in 1934 with that of 1933, it has increased by 30%. The above points and their relief methods are respectfully requested to be reviewed by your office and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance for adoption and implementation, so as to ease business difficulties and increase tax revenue. Respectfully, to the Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3>Kong Wu and Others Telegraph to Aediff to Repair Water Conservancy</h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Chairman of the Drought Relief Association, and others, telegraphed to Mr. Aediff, Chairman of the China Foreign Famine Relief Committee, yesterday, saying: "To Mr. Aediff, China Foreign Famine Relief Committee, Hu Cai Chang Hutong, Peiping, knowing well: This association believes that frequent natural disasters in recent years are actually due to the disrepair of water conservancy. We now intend to carry out work relief to remedy this. After investigation, the areas most severely affected in recent years are Changyuan, Puyang, and Dongming counties. We plan to start with these three counties. However, we feel that there is a lack of personnel familiar with engineering. We have long admired your committee's outstanding achievements in handling work relief in various provinces over the years. After discussing with Mr. Baker, a consultant to the association, we telegraphed you, first requesting you to send personnel to Changyuan to investigate and find out the details of the disaster suffered by the county, and how to repair the rivers and benefits. Please show us a detailed plan. We hope you will agree. We are extremely grateful. More details will be provided in a letter. Kong Xiangxi, Xu Shiying, Wang Zhengting, Wang Yiting, Wu Tiecheng, kowtow."</p>
<h3>Refugees Disturbed Passing Through the Territory</h3>

<h3>The Counterfeit Franc Case Awaits Sentencing</h3>
<p>Chen Jiannan, a native of Wenzhou, 47 years old, had been running a restaurant in Brazil for 23 years. He returned to his hometown last April. At the end of December, he arrived in Shanghai by ship and stayed in room 30 at the Yong'an Hotel at 24 Dongyouheng Road, planning to go to Brazil again. He was discovered by Chinese detective Zhu Shanghe of the Huishan Police Station to be in possession of counterfeit currency. On January 9, at 5:00 PM, he reported to the head detective and secretly went with a Western detective to arrest Chen. They found 920 five-franc coins and 516 ten-franc coins in his luggage, placed flat in a white cloth long vest, sewn tightly with thread, worn from the top, and covered with an overcoat, so no one knew. They also found two counterfeit Chinese currency yuan, four counterfeit dimes, and 51 genuine five-yuan Shanghai banknotes in his pockets and took them all to the police station. He confessed to the First Special District Court that he had bought the francs and counterfeit silver dimes from a Mr. Someone he did not know on the ship when he came to Shanghai, spending 100 yuan, to take to Brazil for use, and that he did not know they were counterfeit, etc. He was instructed to reschedule the hearing and have experts authenticate the francs. The defendant was remanded in custody. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan opened the Third Criminal Court for a hearing. Mr. Li Zhishan, a lawyer for the Shanghai Municipal Council, stated that the francs had been authenticated by experts from a French bank as completely counterfeit. Photographs of the genuine and counterfeit currencies were taken, clearly distinguishing them. He presented a large album of these photos for inspection. When questioned, the defendant insisted that the francs and counterfeit silver dimes belonged to Mr. Someone on the ship and that he had been deceived. The rest of his testimony was evasive. He asked for leniency. Judge Wu ordered that he remain in custody and scheduled a sentencing date.</p>
<h3>Three Robbers Attempted to Rob Without Success</h3>
<p>Hu Guoyao, a Ningbo native residing at No. 1 Chengzhili, Jingxiu Road, Ximen, was working at the Gold Exchange. Yesterday morning at around 9:00 AM, three people wearing blue cloth gowns, armed with sharp weapons and speaking with a local accent, broke into his house on the pretext of asking for someone. One person was on guard outside, and two rushed upstairs, attempting to rob the house. At that time, a woman living in the house was going out to fetch water and saw this. She immediately reported it to the Seventh Team of the City Security Corps. After receiving the report, the team ordered team members Zhao Xin, Sheng and two others to go to catch the robbers. Seeing that the situation was not good, the robbers escaped over the eaves of the house. It is heard that a household in the residence suffered losses, and the local security corps deserves credit for its efforts.</p>
<h3>Illegally Possessing a Handgun to Murder Someone</h3>
<p>The Case was Cracked at the Greater China Hotel</p>
<p>Detectives and Western detectives of the Old Gate Police Station learned that someone was illegally possessing weapons and secretly discussing unlawful acts in room 315 of the Greater China Hotel on Xizang Road. At around 10:00 PM the night before last, they secretly went to the room and arrested five people: Wang Genfu, Chen Caibao, Qian Hongfa, Zhou Qiusheng, and a woman, Lu Xiaomei. They found three handguns and 24 bullets on the bed and took them all to the police station, where they were separately detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Special Court and prosecuted under Article 1 of the Regulations for the Suppression of Military Firearms. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, rose to state the case, and said it was found that the room was registered under the name of Wang Linsheng. However, according to Chen Caibao's confession at the police station, Qian Hongfa had a handgun and gave it to him at the entrance of the Xiaoshanghai Inn in Dongxinqiao last night to take to room 315 of the Greater China Hotel to discuss the murder of someone surnamed Zhang. Currently, the police station has not yet investigated the case due to time constraints, and the seized handguns must be sent to the Shanghai Municipal Council's Armory for inspection. Therefore, he requested permission to reschedule the hearing and presented the ammunition as evidence. When questioning the defendants, except for Chen Caibao's confession that Qian Hongfa had given him the handgun in preparation for murdering someone surnamed Zhang, the rest all evaded responsibility. Judge Qian Hongye reviewed the confessions and ordered that all the defendants remain in custody separately and that the hearing be rescheduled for seven days to investigate the case further.</p>

<h3>An Autopsy of the Old Woman Found in the Opium Den Fire on Xiamen Road</h3>
<p>The drug manufacturing facility at No. 46 and 48 Zunli, Xiamen Road, suffered an explosion and building collapse on the eighth of this month due to negligence during work, resulting in many deaths and injuries on the spot. All details have been recorded in this newspaper in previous issues. Also, Western and Chinese detectives from the Old Gate Police Station discovered the body of an old woman in the rubble and found two egg baskets beside the body. Later, the detectives learned that the old woman's name was Ye Ai, 69 years old, a native of Sancaitang, Pudong. She had no children and was from a poor family. She usually carried a basket and sold chicken and duck eggs along the streets of Shanghai every day. She happened to be passing by the facility that day when she was crushed to death. The detectives took the body to the autopsy station on Faelun Road. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor dispatched by the First Special District Local Court, along with Zhang Yan from the French Concession and Wang Zusi, a clerk, arrived at the station to examine the body. First, Chinese detective Xue Ziven reported the details of the case. Then, Liu Ye, the daughter of the deceased, made a statement. Tang then ordered an examination, which confirmed that the deceased, Ye Ai, was female and had been crushed to death by the collapsed building. The body was released to Liu Ye, the daughter of the deceased, who signed a receipt for its return for burial.</p>

<h3>Brave Detectives Rescue Kidnapped Victim Wang Boying</h3>
<p>One Bandit Killed, Four Male and Three Female Bandits Captured Alive</p>
<p>Rescued from Rongfuli, Western Aihuiamus Road</p>
<p>Victim Wounded by Stray Bullet, Immediately Sent to Guangci Hospital</p>
<p>Wang Boying (38 years old), a director of the Great Eastern Book Company from Shaoxing, Zhejiang, was kidnapped on the morning of the 10th of this month at 0:10 AM when he was returning from an outing in his private car to his residence at No. 7 Changfengli, Tongfu Road. When the car reached the alley entrance, three kidnappers, two men and one woman, suddenly kidnapped him. At the same time, they drove the chauffeur, Feng Futang, near the Great World and abandoned him there, hiding the victim without a trace. Wang's car was discovered in the French Concession on Guofumin Road in the afternoon. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. Since the case occurred, the police authorities of both the Chinese and Foreign concessions in this port have made every effort to investigate. Miraculously, only four days later, the case was completely solved. When the detectives stormed the bandits' den, the bandits opened fire to resist arrest. One bandit was killed on the spot by the detectives, and a total of four male and three female bandits were captured alive. The kidnapped victim, Wang Boying, was wounded in the left arm by a stray bullet but was not seriously injured. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>A Female Guest at the Dafa Hotel</p>
<p>Around midnight the day before yesterday, a female guest, dressed fashionably and about 20 years old, suddenly came to the Dafa Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession. She registered under the name He Xiuying, a local, and booked room 201 on the second floor of the hotel. At first, there was nothing unusual. Yesterday morning, two men came to the room and closed the door for a secret conversation with the female guest. The waiters and others did not pay much attention.</p>
<p>Chinese and Western Detectives Search for Kidnappers</p>
<p>Yesterday, at around 11:00 AM, the Chengdu Road Police Station in the Public Concession suddenly received a telephone tip that the kidnappers of Wang Boying were in room 201 of the Dafa Hotel. The station immediately ordered Chinese and Western detectives to join forces with detectives from the French Police Station and went to the address to arrest the woman, He Xiuying, and two young men. From their confession, they learned that there were other accomplices in room 308 of the Dazhong Hotel (the old site of the Hong Kong Hotel) across the street. The detectives then went to the Dazhong Hotel and arrested another male bandit, Cai Bingyun, and a female bandit.</p>
<p>He Xiuying Confesses the Location of the Victim</p>
<p>After capturing all the bandits, they were all taken to the Lujiiawan Police Station and interrogated rigorously. The female bandit He Xiuying confessed that the kidnapped victim Wang Boying was being held in the headquarters at No. 14 Rongfuli, Western Aihuiamus Road, in the French Concession. Based on her confession, the police chief led the female bandit to the destination at 12:20 PM, accompanied by Wan Langdeng, the first chief of the police department, and Jin Jiulin, the chief inspector, Zheng Tanmu, Zhou Bingcheng, Bao Tan, Liu Dianlong, and others bravely stormed into the bandits' den.</p>
<p>Detectives and Bandits Fought Like Linked Pearls</p>
<p>When the detectives reached their destination, there were three male and female bandits guarding the victim in the bandits' den. They were prepared and opened fire as the detectives rushed in, firing four or five shots in total. All shots missed. At this time, the detectives also opened fire in retaliation. Both sides were like confronting a major enemy, and the gunfire was as dense as linked pearls. The stalemate lasted for more than ten minutes.</p>
<p>One Bandit Killed, Victim Rescued</p>
<p>As a result, a male bandit wearing a grey woolen student uniform was shot three times in the chest and hand and fell to the ground dead. The kidnapped victim, Zhu Boying, was also hit in the arm by a stray bullet. The detectives rescued him from danger, and the remaining two male and female bandits surrendered without resistance and were taken back to the police station. After a brief interrogation by the police chief and registration, they were handed over to Chinese and Western detectives from Chengdu Road to be brought back for interrogation and handling.</p>
<p>Police Station Must Continue to Pursue Remaining Accomplices</p>
<p>The injured Wang Boying was immediately escorted to Guangci Hospital on Avenue Dubail for treatment. It is heard that he is not in serious condition. At the same time, the police chief sent Bao Tan Zhang Chunsheng to Rongfuli to take the body of the killed bandit to the autopsy station. According to the arrested bandits, the dead bandit's name was Yao Muqing, 25 years old, from Wuxi. The case will be reported to the court for inspection today. The police station is continuing to investigate the remaining accomplices.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang Leads Charity Performance Opening Yesterday at the Sanxing Theater</h3>
<p>Many Foreign Guests Attended</p>
<p>Committee Meeting Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The charity performance co-organized by the China Philanthropic Association for Children and the Jiang-Zhe Drought Relief Fundraising Association opened yesterday at the Sanxing Theater on Niuzhuang Road. The theater was packed. Prominent figures in Shanghai, such as Huang Jinrong, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, and Wang Xiaolai, had reserved boxes in advance. On the Western side, representatives from the Russian Consulate in Shanghai, the French Consulate General, and others had also reserved seats. The Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also reserved seats daily to entertain Western guests stationed in Shanghai. Because of the enthusiastic participation of Westerners, the association specially appointed Chen Liting, Shi Boqun, Zhang Shudun, Wang Boheng, and Chen Zheqing, among others, to receive the foreign guests yesterday to show its thoughtfulness and courtesy.</p>
<p>According to news from the joint office of the association, yesterday they received a telegram from Mr. Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan of the National Government, stating, "The representative of the Russian Consulate in Shanghai, and others, requested Mr. Chu's performance, and he may come to Shanghai to provide some amusement." It is now heard that Mr. Chu's performance list has been changed. On the sixteenth night, he will still perform "Ci Wang Liao" (Assassinating King Liao), and on the seventeenth night, "Cao Qiao Guan" (The Cao Bridge Pass) has been changed to "Huang Ling" (Imperial Mausoleum). It is also reported that Ms. Wei Xinyuan, a famous female opera singer from Nanjing, has arrived in Shanghai and is scheduled to perform the wonderful play "Yuan Men Zhan Zi" (Executing the Son at the辕门) tonight (the 15th), which will bring a fresh atmosphere.</p>

Ms. Wei Xincai, a famous Nanjing singer and female doctor, came to Shanghai yesterday to discuss medical affairs. The fundraising association learned of this and specially invited her to join. Ms. Wei will sing "Yuan Men Zhan Zi" tonight (the 15th). Ms. Wei has always been highly praised for her performance of this play, and her generous appearance this time will add even more color.</p>
<h3>Shocking News: White Paper Used Instead of Banknotes</h3>
<p>Each Bundle of Banknotes Had Only One Real Banknote on Top, the Rest Was White Paper</p>
<p>A Total Shortage of 42,305 Yuan</p>
<p>—The Main Culprit, Hua Zhongchu, Flees to Hong Kong with Two Prostitutes—</p>
<p>The China Agricultural and Industrial Bank at 348 Henan Road issues banknotes. Qian Zhuang (money shops) that do business with the bank and want banknotes of a consistent style can exchange their various banknotes for the bank's uniform banknotes. On the 12th of this month, the Jiuru Qian Zhuang on Huade Road in Hongkou sent an old clerk to the Agricultural and Industrial Bank with 16,000 yuan in miscellaneous banknotes. After the bank's staff checked them, they took out three large bundles and one small bundle of banknotes from the banknote storage room, saying that the large bundles each contained 5,000 yuan and the small bundle contained 1,000 yuan, all in 10-yuan denominations. The old clerk then opened the bundles to count them, but unexpectedly, in each bundle, only the top banknote was a genuine 10-yuan note, and the rest were blank pieces of paper without a single word on them. He immediately returned them all. The bank staff was shocked to see this. They re-counted the amount and handed it over to the old clerk to take back. The bank manager was informed and appointed staff to go to the banknote storage room and carefully check each bundle of banknotes, and found many bundles with the above-mentioned fraudulent situation. The total shortage was as high as 42,305 yuan. The banknote storage room was staffed by five clerks and three trainees who were responsible for managing and checking the banknotes. After the incident, Hua Zhongchu, one of the five clerks, had disappeared. The other four, Ding Chengfu from Pudong, Pan Ruilin from Suzhou, Zhu Minggui from Jiangbei, and Ding Hao, were under serious suspicion. Later, the bank manager reported to the General Inspectorate, which sent Detective Zhang Mingde to investigate. The four, Ding, and others were arrested at 6 p.m. the previous evening, and they were asked about Hua Zhongchu's whereabouts. According to Ding, Hua Zhongchu had been spending lavishly recently, opening room 224 at the Yangtze Hotel as a pleasure den and also frequenting prostitutes, forming an inseparable bond with Yinghong the Second and Yinghong the Third at the Yinghong Shuyu in Huile Lane, Guangxi Road. Detective Zhang believed that Hua might still be indulging in hotels and brothels, and immediately went to the two places to investigate. It was then learned that Hua had taken this pair of sisters and boarded a ship of the Dale Yanghang at 4 p.m. the day before, fleeing to Hong Kong. Detective Zhang then asked the captain to send a telegram to the British authorities in Hong Kong, asking them to conduct a thorough search when the ship arrived in Hong Kong and to detain Hua and the two prostitutes if found, and to reply by telegram so that they could be brought back. Yesterday morning, Ding, Pan, Zhu, and Ding were sent to the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, described the course of events and requested that Ding et al. be handed over to the police for detention pending a detailed investigation and the return of the fugitive before proceeding with the prosecution. Judge Qian of the court questioned Ding et al. briefly and ordered them to be detained pending further questioning.</p>
<h3>Four Unemployed Overseas Chinese from Vladivostok Repatriated</h3>
<p>Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Morning on the Bingfa Wheel</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Finding Ways to Send Them Home</p>
<p>Song Shaoxian, a 21-year-old from Laiyang County, Shandong Province, was unemployed at home in the 16th year of the Republic of China and could not make a living. He traveled to Vladivostok by ship with his mother, Song Ji (40 years old), to work. At the same time, fellow villagers Guan Fuchen (58 years old) and Dong Xiyan (70 years old), from Yexian County, Shandong Province, also worked in Vladivostok. After eight years, they were affected by the recent economic downturn there, and there was no work to do, so they were unemployed and destitute. As a result, they were stranded in a foreign country and had difficulty finding food and lodging. Song and the other three reported to the Chinese Consul General in Vladivostok, requesting assistance in repatriation. After receiving the report, the consul considered it pitiful that the overseas Chinese were stranded in a foreign country and prepared a document to send Song Shaoxian and the other three men and women back to China. They boarded a French ship on the 8th of this month, departing from Vladivostok, and arrived in Shanghai at about 8 a.m. yesterday morning. After landing, they presented the document to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, requesting assistance. The bureau instructed the relief section to summon the case, interrogate each person's name and register the case, and then sent Song Shaoxian and others to the Xintai Hotel in the 16th block of Nanshi for temporary accommodation, and will repatriate them to their original home in Shandong.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese from the Dutch East Indies Come to Shanghai to Investigate Real Estate</h3>
<p>Paying Attention to Land in the City Center</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Chonghe, an overseas Chinese from Makassar, Dutch East Indies, has been working in the local government for many years and has been enthusiastic in supporting various businesses of the resident overseas Chinese, so the overseas Chinese in that port have a very good feeling towards him. Mr. Ye grew up overseas and has long admired the vastness and richness of his motherland. He has repeatedly wanted to take the opportunity to return to China for sightseeing. This time, taking advantage of his vacation, he returned to China from the Dutch East Indies for inspection. He arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong the day before yesterday and is staying at the Xin Asia Hotel. He carries many letters of introduction from well-known overseas Chinese merchants in the local area. Mr. Liu Shimu of the China-South Seas Association in Shanghai, having been introduced by a friend from the Dutch East Indies in advance, specially came forward to receive him. He has been accompanying him to visit the city center, Wusong, Zhabei, and major banks in recent days. It is heard that Mr. Ye's purpose in coming to Shanghai is to investigate land prices in the city center, and he plans to report to overseas Chinese in various ports when he returns to the south at the end of this month. If the domestic government has solid guarantees for returning overseas Chinese, in the future, overseas Chinese in the South Seas will definitely be enthusiastic about returning to Shanghai to invest in various businesses, because many overseas Chinese merchants in the South Seas now feel that the markets in various places in the South Seas are unusually desolate and have no capital to invest, so they cannot use their capital and are extremely frustrated. During his return to China, when he stayed in Hong Kong, he was introduced by a friend and purchased real estate in many places. He did not know that the real estate in the Shanghai city center was even more beautiful than that in Hong Kong.</p>
<h3>In an Instant, the Iron Box Disappeared</h3>
<p>The Central Bank Quickly Solves the Case</p>
<p>Prompt Search Finds the Stolen Silver Intact</p>
<p>—Chef Li Zhengyin Sentenced to Two Months—</p>
<p>The Runfeng Qian Zhuang stored 16,500 yuan in banknotes in an iron box at 2 p.m. the day before yesterday and sent apprentice He Wenkui to the Central Bank outside the Concession to exchange them for silver. After arriving at the bank, while he and other staff members were taking out the banknotes from the box to check them, the iron box suddenly disappeared in an instant. However, only 4,500 yuan of banknotes had been taken out of the box, and most of them remained. The apprentice panicked and immediately asked the doorman and patrolman of the bank, but they had not seen anyone carrying the box out. They realized that the stolen goods were still in the bank. The patrolman immediately searched the bank and found the original box under the bed in the bedroom of Li Zhengyin, a Yangzhou chef in the bank. The remaining 12,000 yuan of banknotes in the box were also intact. The patrolman reported to the General Inspectorate, which sent Chinese and Western detectives to arrest Li. The Central Bank exchanged the original stolen money for silver and handed it over to He Wenkui to take back to Runfeng. Yesterday morning, the police summoned witnesses and sent Li to the First Special District Court. Judge Zhan Liangce opened the court to interrogate him. Police lawyer Chen Ming explained the course of the case and requested that the defendant be punished for theft. Chen Zongguang and He Wenkui, staff members of the Central Bank, testified to the situation at the time. When questioned, the defendant Li Zhengyin could not deny that the stolen goods were found in his bedroom, but denied that he stole and hid the box, saying that he did not know who put it under his bed. After reviewing the confession, Judge Zhan sentenced Li to two months in prison as a warning.</p>
<h3>Lawyer Cai Xiaobai Pelted with Excrement by Scoundrels</h3>
<p>Cai Bravely Chases and Captures One Person</p>
<p>Lawyer Cai Xiaobai from Hangzhou was leaving his office at 542 Xiafei Road at about 7 p.m. on the 13th after finishing his work and going home when two young scoundrels followed him. Cai did not pay attention at the time. When he arrived at the intersection of Xiafei Road and Hualong Road and walked a few steps south, the two scoundrels stretched out a mixture of strong acid and excrement and smeared it on Cai's head and face. When Cai realized that his left cheek had been smeared with corrosion, and his collar and coat were stained, the two rascals turned around and fled. Cai bravely chased after them and shouted for help. A scoundrel named Shi Acai (47 years old) from Ningbo was finally captured and taken to the police station. Detective Zhang Huaiqi investigated the case and detained Shi. Yesterday, he was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special Court. Police lawyer Fei Xizhen explained the case and requested an extension to investigate the case and arrest the accomplices who were at large before requesting a trial. After Cai Xiaobai, the victim, described the injury he suffered from the defilement, Judge Wu Fanglian questioned the defendant briefly and ordered that the hearing be adjourned to the 19th. The defendant was remanded in custody, and the victim was instructed to go to the forensic office for an examination of the injury pending verification. It is heard that the police have changed the criminal law provision and are prosecuting him for injury. At the next court hearing, the case will probably be transferred to the local court for trial.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai South Public Bus Management Office Increases Special Buses for the Longhua Incense Fair</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Start on the First Day of Next Month</p>
<p>New Routes Will Be Opened at the Same Time</p>
<p>The Shanghai South Public Bus Management Office of the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities has ordered more than 20 large Montane light buses from the United States to develop traffic in Nanshi. New routes will be opened on March 1. The details are as follows: The Shanghai South Public Bus Management Office is adding vehicles to the Longhua Incense Fair route, as the number of buses on the original Route 1 will not be enough to handle the expected traffic during the upcoming Incense Fair this year. The large Montane carriages are now being fitted overnight, and it is expected that they will be completed by the end of this month and will start operating on the first day of next month.</p>
<p>New routes will be opened at the same time. Shanghai South Public Buses currently only have Route 1, the Longhua Line, and Route 2, the half-circular city route. In order to develop traffic, two new routes have been specially opened: (1) from Xieqiao via Ximen to Zhaojiabang Road and the 16th block; (2) from Xieqiao along Lujiabang Road to the Hugunjunying, via Limalu and Banchengyuan Road to Xieqiao as the terminus. These two routes will start operating on March 1 at the same time.</p>
<h3>Morning: Public Concession in Good Health</h3>
<p>According to the Public Works Department's health officer's work report for the previous year, although the summer was unusually hot and there was a lack of rain, there were generally not many major infectious diseases. In terms of mortality rate, the foreign rate was 11.43 per thousand, which is comparable to that of major cities around the world. However, the foreign population in Shanghai has fewer elderly and infirm people, which is also a reason for the low mortality rate. The mortality rate for Chinese residents was 14.25 per thousand, which is also not high. However, this record is not reliable and there are factors that cannot be managed, so it cannot be used as a basis.</p>
<p>Cholera Is Almost Non-Existent: Cholera has hardly occurred in the morning. This phenomenon has continued for two years. Since its historical cyclical nature has not been broken, it is unlikely to break out on a large scale this year, but it is difficult to say. However, smallpox was quite prevalent in January and March, reaching a high of 21 cases in one week. There were also many gastrointestinal diseases such as typhoid fever and dysentery. Typhoid fever vaccinations have been carried out for several years, but they do not seem to be very effective and need to be further prevented. As for dysentery, it will not be easy to stop it until there is great progress in sanitation outside the concession and effective measures are taken to disinfect food. New methods have been tried for fly control, which may be effective. This requires long-term effort.</p>
<p>Physical Examination of School Children: The general work of the Health Department this year has been quite calm, but the physical examination of school students is a new initiative. It has started with the municipal Chinese schools. The preliminary survey found many cases of trachoma and other infectious diseases, and prevention was immediately carried out. The cost is small, but it can avoid future transmission and the gains are huge.</p>
<p>Milk Disinfection and Inspection: The Milk Investigation Committee's research concluded that all [B] grade milk and cheese should be compulsorily disinfected. Shanghai's weather is warmer and milk is more likely to be dangerous, so disinfection is necessary. Due to the development and competition in the dairy industry, prices will not increase. The unprecedented development of dairy factories is due to the increasing number of Chinese people who drink milk, but the effectiveness of supervision is also important. Because the loss of dairy cows with infectious diseases in Shanghai is quite large, attention has been paid to the isolation of cattle. The dairy farmers are very willing to cooperate, and it seems that the prevention has been slightly effective. In addition, regulations have been drafted for the import of cattle from other ports, and they will be implemented after the National Government promulgates measures to achieve consistency.</p>
<p>Further Promotion of Hospitals: There has been no major expansion of hospitals this year. The fever hospital in the western district will not be able to start construction until 1935. Accommodation for the mentally ill is becoming increasingly difficult, but the mental hospital has been slightly modified, and the Bureau has also provided subsidies for the construction of a new charitable hospital in Minhang, which may slightly relieve concerns in this area. As for the equipment for general diseases, the construction of the Medical Investigation Committee has been further studied in detail. The Health Department believes that it is possible to set up needed clinics at any time, and to subsidize the corresponding hospitals, so that they can reserve some beds in the concession. This idea has been approved by the board of directors.</p>
<p>Special Research on Hookworm Disease: Due to a doctor's raising the issue of whether hookworm disease is transmitted to children through parks, a detailed study has been conducted. However, the investigation is difficult to start. Only a few park employees were found to have the disease, but this is also a normal phenomenon. Mass treatment has now been carried out and will be observed again. In addition, attention has been paid to preventing the risk of transmission from outside the park, but it is difficult to prevent children from walking barefoot in the countryside.</p>
<h3>Fourth Malu Road Surface Modified</h3>
<p>General Section Between Sichuan Road and the Bund</p>
<p>The Public Works Department announced that the section of Fuzhou Road (i.e., Fourth Malu Road) between Sichuan Road and the Bund will be modified. From the 15th to the 28th of this month, all vehicles will only be allowed to travel east.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Seizes Narcotics and Other Contraband</h3>
<p>According to the report of the Jianghai Customs Tax Affairs Department, the number of narcotics such as opium and morphine seized in October, November, December, and March of the 23rd year is as follows: a total of 236.68 taels of foreign opium, local opium paste, and tobacco ash, estimated at 1,322.49 yuan in national currency; a total of 232.21 taels of morphine and heroin, estimated at 32,864.65 yuan in national currency; and various medicines containing toxic substances, estimated at 350.25 yuan in national currency.</p>
<h3>The Zoo Purchases a Large Whale to Make a Specimen for Permanent Display</h3>
<p>Weighing More Than Ten Tons, Immense</p>
<p>The Municipal Zoo recently purchased a huge whale from Chongming, which was loaded onto a wheel and transported to Shanghai on the 4th of this month. It is now stored at the specimen manufacturing center in Gaochang Temple. A reporter from Dagong News visited the center yesterday. The whale is 41 feet long, its abdomen is 16 feet in circumference and 7 feet wide, its mouth is 8 feet long, its flat head occupies almost one-third of its body, its eyes are small, its tail is flat, it has no hind fins, it has nostrils on top, its back is black, and its abdomen has cloud patterns. It weighs more than ten tons, which is immense. However, it died after being taken out of the water. The specimen manufacturing center is now removing the whale meat to make a full-size skeleton specimen. The weight of the whale skin and bones still reaches five tons. The whale's skeleton will likely be finished within a month and will be displayed in the Municipal Zoo for the public to view.</p>
<h3>The Soviet Special Ship for Welcoming Mei, the Sif, Has Arrived in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Stopping in Pudong to Load Chinese Tea</p>
<p>Will Not Depart Until Three Days Later</p>
<p>The Soviet government specially sent a special ship to Shanghai to welcome Mei Lanfang and others to Russia. The Greek ship that was sent first was replaced with the Sif ship from the Soviet Russian merchant fleet due to the poor quality of its cabins. The ship has arrived in Shanghai and is now loading goods. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai to Unload Cargo</p>
<p>The S.S. Sever, the special ship sent by the Soviet government to China to welcome Dr. Mei Lanfang and others to Russia, arrived in Shanghai from Vladivostok yesterday morning. Because the ship contained Russian goods that needed to be unloaded in Pudong, it immediately berthed at the Swire Company's Huatong Wharf. Unloading began yesterday at noon.</p>
<p>Welcoming Mr. Mei</p>
<p>The Sif ship is the best passenger ship in the Soviet merchant fleet, originally sailing in Europe. This time, it was dispatched to China by order of the Soviet government to transport Mei Lanfang and his party. The Soviet Association in Shanghai is responsible for all reception arrangements on board. After the ship arrived in Shanghai yesterday, the association sent personnel to the ship to discuss everything with the captain.</p>
<p>Loading Tea Bricks</p>
<p>In addition to welcoming Dr. Mei and his party, the Sif ship is transporting a large batch of tea bricks, a total of 40,000 bags, to Russia, first to Vladivostok, then to Moscow. The ship has already started loading these tea bricks. According to the personnel managing the ship, the Sif ship will take about three days to load all the tea, so Dr. Mei's departure from Shanghai will be three days after the tea is loaded.</p>

<h3>Municipal Zoo Plans to Purchase New and Exotic Animals</h3>
<p>Polar Bears, Rhinos, Zebras, Sea Lions, Orangutans, and Other Animals</p>
<p>More Than Ten Thousand People Visited on the 5th</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road in Shanghai has been very popular with visitors recently during the New Year period. On the 5th of this month (i.e., the second day of the lunar New Year), the number of visitors reached 15,766. According to Shen Xiangrui, the director of the zoo, the zoo plans to add polar bears, rhinos, and other animals. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparing to Purchase Animals</p>
<p>The zoo recently added two bird sheds, one to the right of the ticket office and one between the eagle shed and the hibiscus bird shed. They have now been fully completed and are scheduled to open this week. One of these bird sheds is for raising golden pheasants, ring-necked pheasants, and other pheasants. These pheasants were originally in the same shed as the cranes. However, the crane platform is in the water, and these pheasants are not accustomed to living in water. They are often startled and fall into the water and drown. This is very unsafe for these pheasants, so a separate shed has been built for them. The other shed was built because the air in the eagle shed and the hibiscus bird shed was poor. A separate aviary was built to allow these birds to expand their range of motion and get more sunlight. In order to expand the zoo's operations, the zoo plans to purchase polar bears, rhinos, zebras, sea lions, orangutans, jackals, wolves, and other new and exotic animals. As soon as funds are available, the zoo will submit a request to the municipal government for approval to purchase them.</p>
<p>Public Actively Visiting</p>
<p>Recently, it has been the New Year, and many people have been visiting. According to the zoo's statistics, the number of visitors from January 1 to February 13 is as follows: 54,935 adults, 12,114 children, 252 groups, for a total of 67,301 people in January. On the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd of February, everyone was busy with the New Year, and there were few visitors. The 4th was a regular holiday and the zoo was closed. On the 5th (the second day of the lunar New Year), the weather was fine, and the number of visitors was particularly high, reaching 15,766. On the 6th, due to the snow, there were only 502 people. On the 7th, there were 8,942 people. On the 8th, there were 10,723 people. On the 9th, it rained again, and there were only 489 people. On the 10th, there was heavy rain and there were only 263 people. The 11th was a holiday. On the 12th, there were 7,901 people. On the 13th, there were 7,334 people. Yesterday, the weather was fine, and the number of visitors was probably over 8,000.</p>
<h3>Collision of Small Boats at Pier No. 4 on the Bund</h3>
<p>The Tianxiang small steamboat was damaged on Tuesday when it was crushed by a ship berthed at the same pier. According to the boat boss's report to the company, the damage was caused by the China Merchants Bureau's Feige ship. The Tianxiang sent a letter to the bureau to negotiate compensation. Yesterday, the bureau summoned the Feige ship's boss, who said that at about 5 a.m. on Tuesday, the Huangpu Beach Pier No. 4 was occupied by nine small ships: Yuguo, Mitsubishi, Huangpu No. 9, Shunxiang, and others. At 5:30 a.m., the sky was not yet bright. The Shunxiang ship suddenly left the pier without sounding its whistle. At that time, there were many ships and they were crowded together. The Shunxiang ship was forced out, causing the other ships to be squeezed. The Tianxiang ship was crushed, but it was not the Feige ship that caused the accident. The bureau sent staff to investigate and confirm that the Tianxiang ship was damaged, and the responsibility was not with the Feige, but with the Shunxiang ship that caused the accident. Yesterday, the bureau sent a letter to the Tianxiang, stating that the issue of compensation should be directly negotiated with the Shunxiang ship and had nothing to do with the China Merchants Bureau's Feige.</p>
<h3>National Goods Film Promotion Team Going to Ningbo</h3>

On the 9th of this month, the first promotion team of the society set off to screen and promote the films in the Ningbo-Shaoxing area. The society received a letter from the promotion team from Ningbo yesterday, stating that the screenings at the public club and the YMCA have been crowded and effective. At the same time, they have received many invitations from various districts, townships, and towns in Ningbo to screen the films, so they will soon go to the countryside to screen them in places such as the Dayantou town in eastern Ningbo, and then proceed according to the prescribed route.</p>
<h3>Shaoxing National Exhibition – Opening Scheduled for March 1st</h3>
<p>National Products Manufacturers Association Sends Representatives to Shaoxing for Setup Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, having previously accepted the invitation of the Shaoxing County Party and Government organs to organize the Second National Products Exhibition in Shaoxing County, and after reaching an agreement on both sides, is actively preparing to proceed. Registration has already begun in Shanghai, and the opening has been set for March 1st. Therefore, in recent days, the registration of various national product factories to participate has been quite enthusiastic. With the opening day approaching, the Association considers the arrangement of venues and other matters to be urgently needed. Therefore, yesterday, it dispatched Standing Committee member Mr. Liu Zhongying on the night express train to Hangzhou, then on to Shaoxing, to plan everything and to consult with the local Party and Government organs. It is said that Mr. Liu's trip to Shaoxing will involve a stay of two or three days, after which he will return to Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Xiamen Branch Urges Collection of Overdue Debts</h3>
<p>The Shanghai branch of Xiamen Bank on Sichuan Road in this city, after receiving an order from the Xiamen head office to prepare for resumption of business, is currently actively proceeding and is expected to realize this by the end of this month or the beginning of next month. Yesterday, the branch also entrusted lawyer Qiu Hanping to issue a notice on its behalf to urge the collection of overdue debts. The transcript is as follows: It is stated by the aforementioned parties that our branch, having previously received an order from the head office to prepare for resumption of business, was announced in a newspaper by a responsible lawyer representative, and subsequently received a letter from the head office stating that the bank's shareholders' meeting had resolved unanimously to approve the preparation for resumption of business and to organize a committee to reorganize the bank's affairs. A deadline of one month has been set for active action, and regarding the Shanghai branch's accounts, it is necessary to urge collection and report in the shortest possible time for verification, etc. Therefore, lawyer is specially entrusted to publish a notice in newspaper to inform all debtors to come to the bank for clearance within two weeks, and if overdue, they will be handled according to law. The above is hereby published on behalf of the firm. February 14th, 24th year of the Republic of China, Office No. 918 Zhonga Ya Road, British Concession, Telephone No. 94063.</p>
<h3>All Ships Should Strictly Prevent Theft of Machine Screws</h3>
<p>The "Xin Feng" has already discovered it</p>
<p>The China Merchants Bureau's Northern Ocean Route "Xin Ming" vessel, on its way to Shanghai this time, discovered that screws on the rudder post of the engine had been stolen. Fortunately, the captain discovered it early and urgently ordered the ship's craftsmen to repair and replace them, so no accident occurred. Afterwards, the captain reported to the Bureau. Because the value of the rudder post nails is minimal, it is obvious that the thief had other intentions, and the loss of a single nail on the machinery can cause extremely great danger, which is of utmost importance to the lives and property of the entire ship. The "Xin Ming" ship's screw theft must be investigated. Yesterday, the Ship Department issued strict orders to all shipowners on all rivers and seas, starting from today, to carefully inspect all machinery parts on the ships, at any time and anywhere, to strictly prevent similar nail theft incidents as on the "Xin Ming" ship from happening again, to ensure navigation safety.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telegraph Office Extends the Regular Holiday Office Hours of Five Receiving Offices</h3>
<p>Effective from this Sunday</p>
<p>Since the merger of post and telecommunications in this city on July 1st of last year, the number of places for receiving and sending telegrams has increased to more than thirty, making it quite convenient for merchants and the public to send telegrams. The Shanghai Telegraph Office, in view of the fact that the office hours of the post office on regular holidays are only three hours, has specially stipulated that starting from this Sunday (the 17th), the office hours of the receiving offices attached to the five post offices on Kaizi Road, Kade Road, Kade Road, Xiafei Road, Lima Road, and Jing'an Temple Road will be appropriately extended from 9:00 AM to 7:00 PM, without interruption in between, to facilitate the sending of telegrams by all sectors. However, outside the post office's office hours, senders must enter and exit through the side door or back door of the post office. In addition, the regular holiday office hours of the receiving office in the Postal Administration will also be extended in the shortest possible time.</p>
<h3>Demolition of Beach Houses along Suzhou Creek</h3>
<p>The Wusong River (i.e., Suzhou Creek) in Shanghai West, from behind the old racecourse, westward to the Fanhuangdu section, has not been dredged for many years, and sand has accumulated on both banks, forming beaches. In general, stores and residents along the river have occupied the beaches and built houses to live in. For several years, they have lived in peace, resulting in the river surface becoming narrower and narrower. Merchant ships from various villages coming to Shanghai often encounter blockages, cutting off transportation. Now, the Dredging Bureau has dispatched workers to start dredging, stipulating that the river surface should be widened according to its original width. Therefore, the houses along the river that occupy the beaches have been ordered to be demolished in recent days. When the project is completed in the future, the passage of ships will be unobstructed.</p>
<h3>Airlines Send Special Aircraft to Distribute Aviation Lottery Tickets Leaflets</h3>
<p>The National Government's Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Tickets have been issued nine times since its issuance and have earned a good reputation, attracting many buyers. It is now reported that the tenth lottery will be drawn on March 1st. In order to assist in promotion, China National Aviation Corporation has specially dispatched an aircraft on the 15th of this month to fly to Shanghai, Nanjing, Jiujiang, Hankou, Fuzhou, Chongqing, Yichang, Chengdu, Wanxian, and on the 16th to Qingdao, Tianjin, Beiping, and other places to distribute leaflets. It is believed that through this promotion, Chinese and foreign people will better recognize the outstanding reputation of the Aviation Highway Construction Lottery Tickets, and the number of ticket buyers will be even more enthusiastic than before.</p>
<h3>Wu Tingsheng to Distribute Tobacco Seeds in Xuchang Today</h3>
<p>Mr. Wu Tingsheng, Executive Committee Member of the American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee, believes that the weather has been gradually warming up, and the newly purchased "Virginia" tobacco seeds from the United States urgently need to be distributed to tobacco farmers in Xuchang to allow for early planting. Therefore, he is scheduled to take the Ping-Hu through train to Xu at 4:00 PM today. As for the Association's self-established experimental field, it will also begin experimentation this spring and serve as a seed production field, specially retaining tobacco seeds for distribution to tobacco farmers again next year. At the same time, self-retention of seeds is prohibited. According to Wu, the tobacco seeds purchased in the United States this time were originally intended to be distributed to farmers without compensation. However, for the sake of restriction, it is proposed to charge a very low price. It is also reported that Mr. Wu's trip will also guide tobacco farmers in cultivation, curing, and other work.</p>
<h3>The Relief Situation in Zhabei in Spring</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau reported to the Zhabei Charity Group that "The second porridge factory on Liuying Road is scheduled to open on February 11th for spring relief porridge, please put it on file and send someone to supervise." The Bureau sent someone to inspect on February 14th. According to the report, 50 large vats of porridge were distributed on that day, using 30 tan of rice. The number of people drinking porridge was estimated to be more than 13,000, which was still insufficient for distribution. The group still followed the example of last year and issued 9 copper coins for large mouths and 6 copper coins for small mouths to those who did not get any porridge, totaling 8,940 wen. The group originally intended to slightly restrict it, only issuing to women, children, the elderly, and the disabled. However, it was not easy to implement in practice. Regarding order, the group, in view of the crowded situation during last year's winter relief, made careful arrangements in advance and sent letters to the Zhabei Branch of the Public Security Bureau and the 1st Regiment of the Security Team and the Security Corps to assign police officers to maintain order. Therefore, the order was better than before. As the weather has been clear and the spring breeze has been warm in recent days, some poor people have occasionally gone out to find a living. Therefore, compared to the winter relief, the number of people may be slightly reduced.</p>
<h3>Jianghai Customs Starts Salvaging the Sunken "Yafu" Vessel</h3>
<p>The Norwegian vessel "Yafu," which collided with the "Tongde" steamer on the Huangpu River in Lujiazui and sank, has been abandoned by the shipping company. Therefore, the Customs Authority has entrusted Jardine Matheson to carry out salvage operations in order to remove the obstruction to traffic on the river surface. The company dispatched workers yesterday to close off the various cabins of the sunken ship and then use pumps to empty the water from the cabins so that it can be salvaged.</p>
<h3>Tongyi Bank – No Definite Date for Extraordinary Shareholders' Meeting Yet</h3>

After entrusting accountant Xu Shuizuo to liquidate, the bank's board of directors originally scheduled an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to be held on the 5th of this month at the accountant's office. However, only a dozen people attended on the scheduled date, with a total of only over 3,000 shares, less than one-fifth of the total shares, and the meeting was adjourned. According to the person in charge of Xu Accounting Firm yesterday, the bank's balance sheet has been finalized, with about hundreds of thousands owed and about one million owed to others. Regarding debts, director Yu Sangcheng is currently contacting them separately. However, there is no definite date for when to reconvene the extraordinary shareholders' meeting. In addition, the chairman of the bank, Zhang Danru, has been very passive about the disputes over the Tongyi Bank incident due to family affairs and has left Shanghai to recuperate for some time.</p>

Some said it was a kidnapping for ransom, others said the child had been ill for a long time and the family was angry and committed such a heinous act, and others said it was a superstitious and cruel act. They were born without raising, so after death, this inhuman act was carried out, cutting off both feet, so that this debt-collecting ghost would not be reincarnated again.

<h3>The Second District and Fourth Branch of the Municipal Federation Held an Emergency Meeting Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Fourth District Branch of the Shanghai Municipal Federation of Citizens of the Second Special District in the French Concession of this city held an emergency meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday. Eleven committee members attended, including Xia Shanxiao, Zhang Youmin, He Yaozhang, Zhang Lizhang, Sun Ruiting, and Huang Zhijin. Chairman Ye Ruizhai reported that a letter was received from member Wang Shunxing, Wang Lianqing, stating that four partners were playing mahjong for pleasure and were arrested by detectives from the French Public Security Bureau. The apprentice Wang Wenqing was also dragged out of bed, threatened by the Chinese inspector Qian Chenglong with a gun, and arbitrarily committed violence. He was then detained in the police station and forced to confess under torture, falsely accusing Dong Wenli, a standing committee member of the Federation, of opening a gambling establishment, hoping to falsely accuse the merchant. Although he was released immediately, the apprentice has been frightened and feels unwell. In this situation, how can the shop do business? Therefore, I specially request you to find a way to protect us. At the same time, Dong, a standing committee member, also reported in a letter about the search by the police and requested a negotiation. What should be done? Please discuss. After the committee members successively expressed their opinions, the following solutions were decided: (1) Send a letter to the police, firmly guaranteeing that Mr. Dong Wenli is a legitimate businessman and has no illegal activities. This time, Inspector Qian arbitrarily searched without any evidence being found and has been sending detectives to monitor him daily, which is illegal, depriving people of their freedom under French law. The French authorities should correct this and guarantee that the same thing will not happen again in the future. (2) Citizens gathering to play mahjong is a habit of merchants for leisure and is not prohibited by law. The inspector dispatched a large number of detectives to arrest people without the permission of the court or issuing a search warrant, which is even more illegal. Then, realizing his mistake, he immediately released them, going back and forth like a child's play, humiliating merchants to the extreme. Since there was nothing to be found, he arrested the apprentice and forced him to confess, falsely accusing Dong of gambling. A strict investigation should be conducted to reassure the business community. (3) Send a letter to the French Concession Taxpayers' Association, requesting the French authorities to respect the legal rights of citizens. In the future, if such incidents occur, a strict and thorough investigation of the facts should be conducted first, and the court should be consulted for a search warrant before execution. Otherwise, if there is no evidence from the court, it will be considered an illegal search, and citizens can refuse it to uphold the law. (4) Regarding the slander and insults suffered by the Dong Standing Committee Member and the member, they should file private lawsuits against the inspector in court separately. Next, the proposal to increase telephone prices again was discussed, and it was decided to send letters to the General Association of Taxpayers and other organizations to convene meetings to oppose it. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>League of Nations and Various Countries Plan Educational Film Cooperation</h3>
<p>Notification of Resolutions from the International Educational Film Association</p>
<p>Seeking Ways to Cooperate with Various Countries in the Future</p>
<p>The International Educational Film Conference was held in Rome, Italy, in April 1934. Representatives from forty countries, including Britain, America, Germany, Italy, and China, attended, as well as representatives from the League of Nations Secretariat, the International Labour Office, and the World Intellectual Cooperation Organization. Renowned educators and film technology experts also participated. A key resolution of the conference was on the "International Mission of Film." The main points of this resolution were to raise awareness among governments regarding the international role of film as a means of promoting spiritual closeness and understanding between nations, as well as to clarify the material and spiritual lives of various peoples. The International Educational Film Association sent the resolution to the International Committee on Intellectual Cooperation of the League of Nations for review, entrusting the national committees on intellectual cooperation to assist in realizing the points listed in the resolution. The secretariat of the cooperation committee has notified the national committees on intellectual cooperation to liaise with the national educational film associations to collaboratively develop a public plan, hoping to achieve positive results from the proposal. The Chinese Educational Film Association appointed Zhu Ying, secretary of the Chinese embassy in Italy, as its representative when the International Educational Film Conference opened. The conference also elected our representative as vice president. Upon receiving notification of the aforementioned resolution from the League of Nations, it is planned to seek opinions from the preparatory committee of the Chinese Association for Global Intellectual Cooperation to proceed together. The resolution is recorded below: (1) The conference recognizes that the important purpose of their work is to make the mission of film a tool for cultivating public morals and knowledge, thereby enhancing mutual understanding between peoples.</p>
<p>The conference believes that film has an educational mission, and therefore, the responsibilities of film scriptwriters, producers, entrepreneurs, competent authorities, and all organizations or individuals engaged in the development of film are greatly increased.</p>
<p>The conference believes that countries should exchange educational films as much as possible, as this is a very effective method of enhancing mutual understanding between nations. Inspection tariffs and administrative restrictions should be reduced to the minimum necessary so as not to affect the principle of promoting exchange. At the same time, the conference also recognizes that inspection and administrative restrictions can prevent dishonest filmmakers and film merchants from producing films that provoke animosity between nations.</p>
<p>The conference sincerely hopes that governments will adopt all effective methods to promote the circulation of impartial films and strictly crack down on films that distort right and wrong.</p>
<p>In order to realize the above principles, the conference recommends that the Educational Film Association, in particular, adopt the following methods for consultants and specialized committees working jointly with the executive department of the World Intellectual Cooperation Organization in Paris: (A) Raise awareness among governments regarding the international role of film and its use as a method of promoting spiritual closeness between nations. Contact government authorities at any time to establish appropriate domestic measures or to negotiate specific opinions on international agreements, as well as conduct preliminary research to facilitate the drafting of formal clauses and submit them to the government. (B) Find ways to promote direct solidarity among film producers, such as through gentlemen's agreements, to encourage each other to produce fair and impartial films that have genuine cultural value and can enhance understanding between nations. (C) Collect and organize materials from various countries regarding film by establishing educational film bases or correspondents in various countries, or by establishing such organizations, in order to understand the material and spiritual lives of various peoples. (D) In order to achieve the above objectives, contact governments and all relevant international organizations at any time as much as possible.</p>

<h3>General Report on the National Labor Exhibition Evaluation (7)</h3>
<p>Appendix</p>
<p>General Public Opinion on the National Occupational Labor Achievement Exhibition</p>
<p>Nearly 100,000 people visited this National Occupational Labor Achievement Exhibition. At the time and afterward, no fewer than a thousand people expressed criticisms and opinions, mostly from the academic and educational circles. Based on all the materials, the main points are summarized below for reference.</p>
<p>A. General Criticism</p>
<p>Most of the audience's comments were general in nature and can be categorized into three types:</p>
<p>(1) Praisers, (2) Dissatisfied, and (3) Skeptics.</p>
<p>(1) Praisers</p>
<p>1. The scale is grand, the works are exquisite, and such achievements are rare for a first attempt.</p>
<p>2. These achievements are the prelude to the development of production education and vocational education, and have already entered the path of linking life and education.</p>
<p>3. These achievements are greatly related to "nation-building and people-nurturing, and cultural revival."</p>
<p>4. The talent, strength, and spirit of our nation can all be slightly evidenced in these works. However, attention must be paid to the application and concentration of such talent and spirit, as well as their tempering and accumulation.</p>
<p>5. There are many national defense designs, which shows that the schools are quite capable of paying attention to national defense education.</p>
<p>(2) Dissatisfied</p>
<p>1. There are many toys and few supplies, many art pieces and few practical items, many entertainment items and few productive items. "There are too many things for decoration and appreciation by a few, and too few related to national economy and people's livelihood." There is no close adaptation to the actual life of society.</p>
<p>2. Most of the products inevitably fail to be "made without labor" or with very little labor, which is inconsistent with the purpose of labor.</p>
<p>3. There are many imitators and few inventors and creators.</p>
<p>4. The raw materials for products from various provinces and cities often neglect local specialties and domestic materials. They do not know how to use them, and even within the scope of local supply, they still purchase European, American, and Japanese materials, abandoning the near for the far, valuing others and belittling themselves. This is the mentality of national self-abasement.</p>
<p>5. The most lacking item in this exhibition is agricultural products. In addition, there are not many heavy industry, mechanical crafts, household affairs, educational supplies, metalworking, aquatic specimens, mineral specimens, scientific instruments, chemical crafts, working drawings, chemical military supplies, and the most common applications.</p>
<p>6. Labor products are mostly biased towards crafts, and the scope is very narrow. Those who do not know may suspect that this exhibition is a national craft product exhibition.</p>
<p>(3) Skeptics</p>
<p>1. Some of the achievements may not be entirely from students. Perhaps teachers worked hard, or workers acted as substitutes, or they were purchased from abroad.</p>
<p>2. Displaying counterfeit products and falsely labeling them actually loses the original intention of promoting production education.</p>
<p>3. To realize the true spirit of labor, one must start from not fabricating.</p>
<p>B. General Hopes</p>
<p>(1) Vocational Labor Education Issues</p>
<p>1. In the future, production education should be promoted, with production technology as the main purpose of training students.</p>
<p>2. In the future, the objects of labor should mainly be those that can promote national consciousness and spirit.</p>
<p>3. In the future, products should tend towards the daily practical applications of the public, so that school education and social needs can be integrated.</p>
<p>4. The mechanical industry should be actively promoted in order to coexist with other countries in the world of scientific competition.</p>
<p>5. The traditional manual teaching methods should be changed immediately. The teacher's responsibility is to guide students to create freely.</p>
<p>6. Vocational education emphasizes the results of production, while labor education emphasizes the work process. The purposes of the two should be clearly distinguished.</p>
<p>7. Courses such as embroidery and sewing should pay attention to work efficiency and application. Various labor projects should pay attention to economic conditions and should not cost too much money.</p>
<p>8. Achievements should focus on peacetime production, not preparation for exhibitions, resulting in ridicule of "temporary efforts."</p>
<p>9. Labor education in schools should be implemented seriously and should not be perfunctory, nominal, and ineffective.</p>
<p>(2) Advocacy and Encouragement Issues</p>
<p>1. The authorities should catch up quickly, work hard to advocate, and find ways to reward.</p>
<p>2. For the achievements of various provinces and cities that are close to people's livelihood and practical, statistics should be added, and methods should be guided and developed.</p>
<p>3. Those whose products are beneficial to society should be commended, permitted to manufacture patents, or exempted from taxes, or reduced their tax rates, to show promotion.</p>
<p>4. Provinces and cities that are perfunctory and irresponsible in this exhibition should be reprimanded.</p>
<p>(3) Establishment of Schools and Factories Issues</p>
<p>It is hoped that the government will expand vocational schools and manufacturing factories to cultivate talents engaged in production. However, the establishment of factories should precede the establishment of schools, which is in line with the procedure.</p>
<p>(4) Achievement Selection Standard Issues</p>
<p>1. The standard for selecting achievements should be strictly stipulated and designed by experts.</p>
<p>2. The works should be rich in educational significance and should focus on quality rather than quantity.</p>
<p>(5) Border Area Achievement Collection and Improvement Issues</p>
<p>1. In the future, the authorities should supervise the border provinces to pay attention to labor, and on the other hand, they should pay attention to the micro-collection methods, so that all places can participate in the products.</p>
<p>2. Subsequently, education should focus on remote provinces and should no longer conduct "hydrangea-style" movements in the prosperous areas of Jiangnan, resulting in deformed development.</p>
<p>(6) Product Control and Promotion Issues</p>
<p>1. Various special works should have unified methods to promote the whole country.</p>
<p>2. A national vocational school product company should be established in the capital, with a special labor material exchange office attached for research purposes.</p>
<p>(7) Teacher Training Issues</p>
<p>1. Statistics are needed for the required labor teachers, and a labor specialty normal school should be established.</p>
<p>2. Conduct labor teacher workshops or discussion meetings, and designate existing labor teachers to intensify training during the holidays.</p>
<p>3. In normal schools, pay attention to curriculum and teachers to cultivate talents suitable for assuming the responsibility of labor education. (End)</p>
<h3>Private School Enrollment Declines This Semester Due to Economic Recession</h3>
<p>Old Students Largely Absent Long After Semester Begins</p>
<p>Municipal Schools Remain Crowded Due to Lower Fees</p>
<p>Due to the economic recession in recent years, the number of students has gradually decreased. The semester has been underway for quite some time, but few students have registered at various schools. Our Shanghai correspondent has investigated the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Private School Enrollment Declines</p>
<p>It has been more than half a month since the beginning of the semester at private schools. Only two-thirds of old students have registered, especially at private secondary schools. Some schools have not even reached half of their enrollment from last semester. This is due to the difficulties of the rural economy and the fact that the Lunar New Year has just passed. Most students from the interior cannot raise the funds and therefore drop out of school. The enrollment of new students has also decreased, so schools are still continuing to recruit students.</p>
<p>Municipal Schools Remain Crowded</p>
<p>However, municipal schools still have full enrollment due to low school fees. Schools such as Wuben, Jingye, Xinlu, Wanzhu, He'an, Xicheng, and Shangwen are very popular. Each time they recruit students, the number of applicants exceeds the number of places by several times. Due to the limited number of places, those with aspirations can only regret their failure. The enrollment of mission schools has not decreased, because most of the students in these schools are children of wealthy families, so they are not greatly affected.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Education Bureau Broadcasts Lectures</h3>

<h3>Shanghai Education Bureau Restricts Fundraising by Schools</h3>

<p>The Shanghai Education Bureau, considering that there are many schools in the city and fundraising is frequently heard, has, in order to prevent abuses, sent personnel to supervise and guide fundraising schools. Fortunately, no fraud cases have occurred. However, those who are generally unaware of the facts believe that there are no restrictions in the city's laws and regulations regarding school fundraising and proceed at will.

<h3>Liangjiang Women's Basketball Team Arrives in the Philippines</h3>
<p>Warm Welcome from Overseas Chinese</p>

The original telegram is transcribed below: Greetings to Mayor Wu, Director Pan, all newspapers, organizations, and groups. Our team arrived in Manila on the 12th and was warmly welcomed by the Philippine Consulate, the Federation of Overseas Chinese, various Chinese organizations, newspapers, and dozens of other groups. A welcoming ceremony is scheduled for the 14th. The entire team is staying at President Qi Tai's villa and has already contacted local teams to arrange games. The dates will be telegraphed later.

<h3>The Question of the Venue for the 1940 World Olympic Games</h3>
<p>Meeting to be Held on the 20th of this Month</p>
<p>Rome, 13th (Havas Agency) - The current Olympic Games are scheduled to be held in Berlin next year. The next session is scheduled for 1940. However, Italy and Japan have both requested to hold the games in their respective capitals, so a decision has not yet been made. It is expected that this matter will be discussed at the Olympic Conference to be held in the capital of Norway around the 20th of this month, and member countries will be asked to use secret ballot to decide. Countries that do not attend will be asked to vote by correspondence. If the Norway conference fails to make a decision, a special meeting may be convened after the end of the Berlin Games to resolve the issue. According to reports, 1940 is the 2,600th anniversary of the founding of Japan, so the Japanese government has requested that the Olympic Games be held in Tokyo. Italy, on the other hand, has prepared to host athletes from all countries. An area in Rome is currently undergoing a complete transformation, with two swimming pools and a huge sports ground under construction. Italy has issued an official statement on the venue issue, stating, "Italy has not given up on hosting the 1940 Games. However, to show generosity to Japan, if the 1944 Games are decided to be held in Rome, it is not impossible to concede the 1940 Games to Japan, to serve as an embellishment for the 2,600th anniversary of the founding of Japan."</p>

This second expedition to Hangzhou is planned for two games. If time permits, they will tour Shaoxing and Ningbo, planning to stay for several days. If they encounter strong opponents, they will play at least one game in each location. The return date to Shanghai is tentatively set for around the 21st of this month (Thursday).</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Jiaoxin)</p>
<p>The hole in an opium pipe, partially covered with smoke residue, is no bigger than a mung bean, but it can suck away all your wealth and reputation; even your life will eventually be buried in this hole.</p>
<p>A vibrant flower, inserted into your lapel by the hand of a florist, might at most cause you to sniff its fragrance. But if a beautiful young woman delicately pins it to your lapel, you would be overwhelmed and treasure that flower twelvefold!</p>
<h3>The Catless Country</h3>
<p>— Xunzi</p>
<p>I recall that twenty years ago, the Commercial Press published a fairy tale called "The Catless Country," which told of: "A country overseas that had no cats, so it was plagued with rats everywhere. Coincidentally, a Chinese merchant ship carried a cat, which the king bought at a high price."</p>
<p>Jingdezhen in Jiangxi Province is a famous porcelain production area. The "rat plague" there is comparable to that of "The Catless Country": "giant rats" weighing two or three pounds are not uncommon. As the saying goes, "rats cross the street in broad daylight, everyone shouts and beats them"—in Jingdezhen, rats walking on the streets during the day is considered "commonplace." Not only do people not shout and beat them, but they also can't beat them: because if you don't provoke the rat, it struts around as if it doesn't put people in its eyes. But when you want to find a weapon to hit it, it has already scampered away: so you can only watch helplessly as the streets are full of rats during the day. At night, it goes without saying, it is simply the rats' world.</p>
<p>It's not that there are no cats in Jingdezhen, but they are rare and precious. The price of a cat is not uncommon at one or two dollars: if you are not careful, the cat at home will be caught by thieves and turned into money! Therefore, one has to tie up the feline with ropes, causing the cat to lose its spirit after ten years of captivity, and its anger has long been thrown into Java. No matter how wildly the rats riot, the cat simply turns a blind eye and a deaf ear. In this way, having a cat is the same as not having one!</p>
<h3>About "Selling Children"</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>The business of trafficking in people is an ugly mark on human history. However, in years of famine and utter desperation, people willingly commit crimes and resort to aggressive means to survive. Besides, selling a child is like cutting off one's own flesh to heal one's own wounds. Although the law does not allow it, the situation is truly pitiable. When we hear the cries of "Selling children!" in the streets and alleys—especially on bleak evenings, in years of decline—who can fail to feel human sympathy and should forgive this behavior! As a certain gentleman from this newspaper described, pretending to sell children in order to cheat a few coins is also something that can be imagined and understood in the circumstances.</p>
<p>One day, I was chatting with my friend Mr. Liu Zixia at his home when we heard the cries of selling children in the alley. The servants and children all said, "This must be genuine, just listen to the desperate, trembling cry from the bottom of their hearts!" Several educated friends expressed their clever opinions: "This is a sham, right? It's acting so well to move people. How could they really sell their own children? They are just trying to get some money from people. Unless the children were kidnapped." Zixia, however, had his own opinion, saying, "There may be some who want to make a few more coins through this, or perhaps they are the majority, but they have no other clever tricks to use, so they have to resort to the moving pity of selling children; why shouldn't they be pitied? There are also those who really intend to sell their own children, because there are too many children, or they hope that the children can have a better future, or for other reasons. If they encounter such clever people—who know it's a trick—or such worldly people—who see through the deception—wouldn't that cut off their livelihood?" Everyone fell silent.</p>
<p>After that, whenever I hear the cries of selling children, I can't help but think of Mr. Zixia's arguments.</p>
<h3>The Fate of Sheep</h3>
<p>— Written by Shiying</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 9: Inept Flattery and Begging Lead to Scorn; Inability to Return Home, Seduced by the Guest's Exaggerations</p>
<p>Even though I am a man, you are two women traveling together, so it doesn't matter. I have hot tea there that you can drink a bowl of. I'll write a note and quietly send it to the Western restaurant in front to notify Mr. Cheng. Whether the matter succeeds or not, I'll give you a signal, which is much better than crying here. Although Mrs. Hu thought what he said made sense, she didn't know what kind of person Zhang Jiefu was and didn't dare to risk going. She didn't make a sound. Yueying said, "Okay, Mother, let's go to this old Zhang's house. I've met him before. You haven't eaten enough tonight, don't catch a cold." Zhang Jiefu said, "Yes, don't catch a cold. Even if Mr. Cheng refuses you, who knows, I can still think of some way for you." This sentence moved Mrs. Hu. She whispered to Yueying, "Shall we go?" Yueying said, "We can go. If Mr. Cheng says it's no good, we'll go back. It's late at night, what are we doing outside?" Mrs. Hu said, "Who isn't saying the same thing?" Jiefu said, "Okay, you don't need to worry anymore, just follow me." As he spoke, he was already leading the way, and he kept turning his head back to nod at them. This made Mrs. Hu and her daughter have no choice but to follow him. So Mrs. Hu supported Yueying's shoulders, following behind Jiefu, and walked to this small courtyard. Jiefu would take two steps and then stop for a while. After stopping several times, he finally led them into the house. Under the lamplight, looking at the complexions of the mother and daughter, Yueying was young after all, so she was still alright. This Zhu Mrs. Hu, with her hair disheveled on both sides, had a thin and gray face with tear stains. Her blue cloth jacket had picked up a lot of black ash from rubbing against the wall. Looking further down, the blue cloth pants revealed a few inches of small bound feet in thick socks. They almost looked like two stumps standing on the ground, where were the feet? (133)</p>
<h3>The Fragrant Imperial Record</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Chapter 22: The Pear Garden Troupe</p>
<p>According to palace custom, although not explicitly stipulated by law, plays were usually performed on the first and fifteenth days of each month. Many of these plays were written by the Empress Dowager herself; originally, the Empress Dowager had a deep understanding of ancient Chinese dramas, and coupled with her considerable literary foundation, writing some plays was really not a difficult task! Performing plays in the palace was also considered a type of family entertainment, so except for major holidays such as New Year's Day, the Lantern Festival, and the Empress Dowager's birthday, it was rare to summon external performers into the palace to perform. On ordinary days, it was all handled by a group of eunuchs. They had also put in a lot of hard work and were skilled in many plays. The skills of a few outstanding talents were even better than those of outside performers. This was something that the Empress Dowager had long taken pleasure in.</p>
<p>Fortunately! The day after the Empress Dowager was saddened by her memories of Tongzhi, which caused the entire ancient palace to be shrouded in a cloud of sorrow, happened to be the fifteenth of the month, the day when plays were to be performed. Usually, on the day before the first and fifteenth, the Empress Dowager would mostly decide in advance what plays to perform the next day and give instructions. Moreover, the plays she chose were often just those few. These few were of course the ones that the old lady loved to listen to the most. She could listen to them repeatedly, five times, ten times in a row, without feeling bored. Naturally, the plays that she had newly written accounted for the majority! Therefore, people outside—including all the princes and ministers—never had the opportunity to hear the plays written by the Empress Dowager, while we few had heard them all so thoroughly that we could even recite the words. We were even tired of listening to them and couldn't wait for the Empress Dowager to stop selecting them again. Because the plays that we loved to listen to the most were still those old plays. These old plays were not only historically long-standing, but also had similar scripts in every troupe, only the dialects used by the actors were different. The reason why they could be passed down for so long and so widely was naturally because they had a kind of captivating appeal! (244)</p>
<h3>Going to Japan (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Jiyun</p>
<p>The ship travels for fifteen hours to Nagasaki, stopping for three hours. We can then go ashore, enough for our investigation. Another twelve hours will take us to Kobe. The customs is nearby, so we can walk. After opening our luggage for inspection, we can take a train at "Sannomiya" train station to investigate industry in Osaka, visit the Imperial Palace in Kyoto, and see the culture of Nagoya, as well as the transportation facilities and commerce of Tokyo. There are many other places of interest, enough to give you a lot of gains that can be adopted after returning home.</p>
<p>You don't have to be timid. If you don't know the way, you can call a taxi. There are slight discounts, the cheapest being less than half a dollar. Rickshaws are very expensive, so don't even try. Who says Japanese vendors and rickshaw drivers are all honest? Don't be too superstitious, I've been cheated before.</p>
<p>When coming out for investigation, don't bring too much luggage, as shipping is very expensive there. One of my companions brought a steel trunk and paid more than six dollars for shipping, which is equal to one person's train ticket. Train shipping is calculated by weight, while shipping to a store is calculated by the number of items, about twenty to forty cents per item. Express train tickets and sleeper tickets must be purchased separately. Third-class cars have "water ting" flush toilets and "running water." Perhaps China will have them in ten years.</p>
<p>When you arrive in Tokyo, you can go to the YMCA and find the Zhang surname secretary. He can solve all your problems with food, clothing, shelter, and transportation. If you want to develop your career or gain new knowledge, going to Japan might be a good way.</p>
<h3>Inheritance Inherited by Dog</h3>
<p>Wealthy dog owners, out of love for their dogs, write down a bequest in their wills for their beloved dogs to inherit upon their death. These things often happen in European and American countries. Some even allocate huge sums of thousands of dollars in their wills for dogs to inherit. Not long ago, a rich man, also a dog enthusiast of course, bequeathed 200,000 pounds to his beloved dog in his will before he died. This kind of thing only happens in countries where there are too many dog lovers, right?</p>
<p>Small Recipes</p>
<h3>Talking About Knife Fish</h3>
<p>— Wan Gong</p>
<p>The best knife fish are produced in the lakes along the Yangtze River. The annual yield is very high, and they are all transported to Suzhou and Shanghai to be enjoyed by city dwellers. The fishermen of Taihu Lake, on the other hand, hardly get to eat any. This is as tragic as "those clad in silk brocade are not silkworm raisers." Knife fish have fine scales and tender flesh, rich but not greasy, and their deliciousness far surpasses that of shad and whitefish. If people were compared to fish, then shad would be mature, glamorous women, whitefish would be flirtatious, pretty maids, and knife fish would be young ladies just budding like cardamom tips: dignified yet lively, robust yet graceful, like sixteen-year-old girls.</p>
<p>Because its essence is particularly beautiful, it is extremely delicious no matter how it is cooked. Now, let me list a few cooking methods:</p>
<p>Steamed Knife Fish: Take a fresh knife fish, cut open its belly and remove the entrails, and rinse it slightly with water to remove the blood. Be sure not to remove the scales—because its flavor is all in the scales. Then, place it in a shallow porcelain pot with a lid, add some ginger, scallion stalks, a piece of raw pork fat, a few drops of cooking wine, and a small pinch of refined salt. Place it in a steamer and steam for thirty to fifty minutes. The heat should not be too high; if it is overcooked, it will become tough and stiff, losing its fresh flavor. This method of steaming is considered the best.</p>
<p>Braised Knife Fish: This is a common method. Although the flavor is richer than steamed, it has already masked some of its true taste. Therefore, experienced gourmets always prefer steamed.</p>
<p>Fried Knife Fish: This is a method for people who are afraid of bones. Use smaller knife fish, and prepare them in the same way as for steaming—cut open the belly, remove the entrails, and wash them slightly, but it is best to remove the scales this time. First, prepare a basin of beaten eggs and flour, and also prepare half a cent's worth of sesame oil. When the oil is hot, dip the fish in the egg and flour mixture, and then place it in the oil pan and fry until lightly golden. Because the bones have become crispy after frying, they will not get stuck in your throat. Although this method is fragrant and crispy, only two or three tenths of its true flavor remain.</p>
<p>Knife Fish Noodles: It is best to make them at home: use large, foot-long knife fish, steam them until cooked, gently peel off the scales, and lightly shake them with chopsticks. The meat will separate from the bones. If some small bones are still attached, squeeze them once more with a linen bag to remove them completely. Then, cook noodles with the original broth and the fish paste. That is truly delicious!</p>
<p>Knife Fish Rice: After opening and washing a knife fish, use three or four bamboo nails to nail it to the lid of the pot from its backbone. Cook the rice in the pot as usual. When the rice is cooked, lift the lid—be careful to lift it gently—and all the knife fish meat will naturally fall onto the surface of the rice. As for the bones? Because they are nailed by the bamboo nails, they are completely suspended on the lid and will not fall into the rice. This small pot of rice is full of knife fish meat and juice. When served, add seasonings and make it into rice soup. It can truly be called supremely delicious!</p>

<h3>Gold Standard Gold in Turmoil</h3>
<p>Lowest Price Seen at 918.5 Yuan</p>
<p>Several Twists and Turns Still Slightly Lose Six Jiao</p>
<p>Official Switching Starts at Three O'Clock Today</p>
<p>The gold market was unsustainable yesterday. The bulls tried their best to exit the market, creating a low price of 918.5 yuan. Large short sellers still came in to cover. Rumors of the central bank opening for cash stirred up a rally, but the market later turned heavy and tired. In the morning, overseas silver markets were flat in both the UK and the US. After the large accounts closed, the US and India bought in, posting a price increase of 0.0625. Exchange rates were flat, though quotes reached 26.7 yuan. Sellers were still eager, pushing it back to 5.6 yuan. Tong Taichang continued to enter. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced, with the UK and US flat. Customs gold unit rose by two percent, slightly rebounding. However, with Fuxing Yongyuan, Yidafa Yongshunmao, and others selling, the morning opened lower. Although large holders provided abundant supply after the opening, buying activity picked up due to low prices. American Eastern Bank Company entered US dollars, pushing the price up. Banks took advantage of the high price to sell, and long positions also began to exit, gradually moving downstream. Despite some struggles, the selling pressure persisted, creating a low price of 918.5 yuan again. Banks took advantage of the cheap price to aggressively buy, and short covering gathered, gradually rebounding. Afterward, the foreign exchange market suddenly tightened, with rumors spreading in the market that the Central Bank was opening for cash of 700 bars. A rally suddenly started, but this claim could not be confirmed, and the panic among long positions did not end. Later, it briefly fell back, and large holders aggressively covered at the low. The situation was stable at noon, but banks repeatedly sold, and the supply was still abundant, leading to much struggle. In the afternoon, after the midday close, the market immediately rose, nearly approaching the 30-yuan mark. However, banks took advantage of the high price to dump, and the selling pressure continued to cause a fall. Large holders added to their long positions, causing repeated rallies, but ultimately the exchange rate boosted the selling pressure, and the trend became unsustainable and tired. Although Indian silver initially rose by three annas, the market was still stable, but the bullish sentiment could not last, and selling gradually occurred. Although Indian silver was flat the second time, it saw a downstream trend. Finally, short covering was still eager, leading to a slight rise from the low. Trading was quite active throughout the day. At 3 PM today, the official switching will begin, with long positions likely posting around 13 yuan. Today's market conditions are recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opened at 924.8 yuan, 1.5 yuan lower than the previous close. Fuxing Yongda Decheng rose from 4.3 to 5.5 yuan. Yifeng Yongdafa Yong sold, falling back to 4.5 yuan.

Hengyu Tong Yurun and others still entered, rising to 6.4 yuan. After fluctuating, the midday close was 926.1 yuan. The market turned attractive after the close.</p>
<p>The market opened in the afternoon at 918.9 yuan, then 5.2 yuan. Huabi came out with March US dollars at 0.0875. Wanxing Yicheng Yuanyi Yuqing Yong Hengyu Yongli Fusheng Yong and others sold, falling to 6.4 yuan. Hengyu Fuchang Qian Changxiang Fuyu Fuxing Yong Qingfa Yong and others paid, rising to 8.9 yuan.

The market was initially firm and then tired after the close. The highest price of the day was 929.2 yuan, and the lowest price was 918.5 yuan, a difference of 10.07 yuan. As a result, it slightly lost 6 jiao compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price was set at 965.9 yuan, according to the Central Bank's gold standard price, approximately 40 yuan above the closing price, more than 1 yuan higher than the previous close. The three-month ledger price was 926 yuan, with the morning water replenishment at 914 yuan, the same in the afternoon. The spot market was stable, still lacking transactions. Tianjin goods added 6 yuan. The gold market fell, and customer selling was sluggish. This price had buying interest. Rumors circulated in the market that the Central Bank was opening for cash of 700 bars, but this was not confirmed. The three-month drop for the April period was generally posted by the long positions at around 13 yuan. The market slightly pre-arranged a small number of transactions yesterday. Wanxing posted the market, with Hengyu selling 70 bars at 11.5 yuan, and Shunli successfully posted 41 bars to Futaiheng at 13.3 yuan. The official switching will begin this afternoon.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was still lively. Long positions continued to close, and short positions were covering heavily.

<h3>Foreign Exchange Still Relatively Flat and Relaxed</h3>
<p>The Situation Was Elusive Throughout the Day</p>
<p>According to foreign news yesterday, London large accounts were flat in both the near and far terms. New York silver prices also did not change. The rise and fall of forward silver prices in Montreal were both slight. London raw gold rose by 1.5 pence. The British pound to the US dollar did not change, the US dollar to the British pound shrank by 0.25, and the British pound to the French franc fell by 12 pounds. The US dollar to the French franc rose by 1.75. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with recent selling prices, the British pound at 1 shilling 5 pence 0.9375, and the US dollar at 36.4375 yuan, slightly tighter compared to the previous close. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced, with the UK and US flat. The customs gold unit rose by two percent, having little impact. After the opening, it was flat, with switching and balancing, and the forward market hardening. Banks all had selling interest, while American Eastern Bank Company grabbed. HSBC's official exchange rate was announced, with the British pound up 1.25 and the US dollar up 1.875, slightly loosening. Chinese merchants were influenced by the gold market and rushed to sell, but banks managed to maintain it by taking the opportunity to grab. The silver balancing tax was announced unchanged. Thereafter, due to the banks' active grabbing, it changed from loose to tight. However, because the banks' grabbing was not strong, Chinese merchants still felt frightened, and the situation seemed elusive. At noon, it seemed loose due to the banks' selling, but in the afternoon, the banks took advantage of the high prices to sell, and although Chinese merchants grabbed, the banks' selling intentions were too eager. Indian silver rose by three annas. The process went from tight to loose, and although there was fluctuation, there were no special changes. Finally, Indian silver did not change, and the situation was still loose. The closing selling prices were the British pound at 1 shilling 5 pence 0.9375 and the US dollar at 36.5 yuan, with little difference compared to the previous close. The forward market was harder, with the British pound at 1.25 and the US dollar at 0.25. Chinese merchants sold first and then grabbed, slightly more selling after balancing.

<h3>Foreign Call Loans Return to One Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday was February 14th, and it has been more than a week since the market opened. Transactions should have become more active, but the current situation is still tight. Foreign call loans were down 0.01 yuan from the previous day, at 0.1 yuan, and bill transactions were also slightly more active than before. In the early morning, transfers were over 2.3 million, and new transactions were over 400,000. There were no transactions in the afternoon. According to news from banks, foreign banks collected over 1.5 million in ticket payments, over 3.2 million in various goods, foreign exchange, and mortgage miscellaneous payments, over 700,000 in special floods, and 400,000 in warehouse entries.

<h3>Securities: 96 Gradually Turning Around, 23 Customs Rally Breaks Out Again</h3>
<p>Market Price Raised to 95%</p>
<p>Many Future Storms</p>
<p>Yesterday at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the 23 Customs rally was intensifying, related to powerful and organized manipulation. An investigation of the current month's deposit account showed over 2.2 million, the forward deposit account showed over 4.4 million, and the circulating amount outside the exchange was only 3-4 million. If the manipulators prepare funds to collect goods and the general holders are not short sellers in the market, then the short squeeze will inevitably become extremely intense. Even raising the price to face value would not be enough to offset the long and short positions, and there would inevitably be unexpected disputes at that time. This is the intention of the long positions. The short positions only know that the market price is high to face value, and anything above face value is illegal. An investigation of 23 Customs showed that the Central Bank only issued it, and it is said that the current inventory is only over 10 million, with the remaining 70-80 million scattered among various banks. Even if the manipulators are able to collect goods, they may not be able to collect any more in March, and the market price has already reached 95% of face value. Spot goods will naturally be released, which is the same principle as the US raising silver prices and China's silver outflow. It is now heard that powerful groups have requested the government to release spot goods to regulate the market or increase the amount of tickets to meet emergency needs. There are many rumors in the market, and no one can agree. Manipulation is undoubtedly occurring. Brokers have stopped new 23 Customs trading to prevent danger. Yesterday, the market opened with most bond markets being weak and spiritless. The 23 Customs continued to rise wildly, with the current month rising sharply by 1.8 yuan and the forward market also rising by 0.5 yuan. The manipulation was becoming more and more alarming. The 96 gradually turned around. In the second session, most of the short positions withdrew from the line, and new transactions were rarely concluded. Most bond markets rebounded by 0.3-0.5 yuan. The 23 Customs rose again by 1.4 yuan, with the highest price at 81.8 yuan, only 0.2 yuan away from the stop limit and 5 yuan away from face value. This wild state has been rare in recent years. Draining the pond to catch the fish, and the authorities are not preventing it, so there will still be storms in the future. As a result, most market prices rose by 0.1-0.2 yuan to 0.5 yuan, but the 23 Customs rose by 3.2 yuan, and the forward market also increased by 1.7 yuan. The total number of transactions was 15,815,000 yuan. The results of its rise and fall are listed below:</p>
<h3>New York Stocks: Tobacco Slightly Rises</h3>
<p>Xinhua Foreign Firm reported yesterday (13th) that Wall Street was quiet. It was slightly mixed in the early morning, and then gradually rose under the leadership of high-level industrial settings. Tobacco stocks rose slightly. According to estimates, the decline in cigarette production in January was not as large as expected. After the stock market closed, Philip Morris Company issued a notice stating that the company had obtained control of United Fruit Company. The total number of transactions for the day was 390,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is shown below: 12th 13th Up/Down</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks 102.42 102.59 Up 0.17</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks 32.74 32.61 Down 0.13</p>

<h3>Yarn Flowers: Replenishing Empty Positions Triggers a Rebound in Yarn Prices</h3>
<p>After a sharp decline in the yarn market the previous day, a rebound occurred today, prompting those who had profited to cover their positions extensively. In the morning, Chang Feng &amp; Co. and Chang Ji, two brokerage firms representing an inland yarn factory, purchased approximately 10,000 bales, all to close out short positions. This temporarily calmed the extremely panicked market. However, spot yarn sales have become sluggish again. Despite this, both long and short positions were closed out in large quantities, suggesting that the market price may stabilize at its current level.</p>
<p>Chang Feng Replenishes Over 7,000 Bales</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market, the near-term three-month contracts were unstable due to lingering bearish sentiment. Most long positions appeared shaky, and many were forced to cut their losses. The situation for the current month's first shipments was particularly alarming, with heavy selling pressure breaking the 80-yuan mark, reaching 79 yuan. The March-April contracts also fell by five or six jiao. However, unexpectedly, the Chang Feng and Chang Ji trading houses suddenly entered the market and purchased aggressively. This quickly dissipated the bearish sentiment, and all floating shares were snapped up by them. As a result, distant-month contracts rebounded by two to four jiao, while the second and third contracts remained stable. Consequently, all months rose by two to four jiao. Before the afternoon session opened, it was rumored that the massive buying was due to yarn manufacturers covering their short positions, leading to a tightening of the market and further gains of two to seven jiao across all months. Sales included: Ji Feng, 2,200 bales; Da Fu, 3,200 bales; Tong Ji, 1,600 bales; He Xing, 1,450 bales; Lu Feng, 1,000 bales; Xin Cheng, 1,050 bales; Yuan Da, 850 bales; Jun Chang, 1,150 bales; Yuan Yi, 650 bales; and Da Chang, 1,000 bales. Purchases included: Da Feng, 1,050 bales; Chang Ji, 2,600 bales; Jun Chang, 900 bales; Ren Feng, 700 bales; Tai Chang, 1,550 bales; Chang Feng, 7,700 bales; and Geng Feng, 700 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Open Interest</p>
<p>February 180.7 179.0 180.6 Up 0.60 30,000</p>
<p>March 182.5 181.4 182.5 Up 0.30 48,500</p>
<p>April 184.5 183.3 184.5 Up 0.70 50,800</p>
<p>April 184.5 183.3 184.5 Up 0.70 50,800</p>

<p>July 185.9 185.4 185.9 Up 0.50 8,250</p>
<p>Total 188,600</p>
<p>Yarn Sales Decrease to Over 500 Bales</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales were lower than before. A full-day tally of sales from various merchants totaled 585 bales, with prices similar to the previous day. Purchases by various groups were as follows:</p>
<p>Changsha 10 Inland 130 Anqing 10 Ningbo 10</p>
<p>Haizhou 15 Shantou 40 Peers 5 Jiangxi 5</p>
<p>Xiamen 5 Yunnan 60 Guangdong 10 Qingdao 10</p>
<p>Sichuan 175</p>
<p>After the cotton flower market's decline, a rebound occurred. Despite continued declines in overseas Indian and American cotton markets, local sentiment remained high. This was due to insufficient deliveries for the current month, coupled with a rebound in the yarn market. Additionally, rising gold prices in the afternoon further fueled buying interest, driving up market prices. However, the price ratio between yarn and cotton flowers indicates that cotton prices are too high.</p>
<h3>Zheng Standard Recovers by About Three Jiao</h3>
<p>At the opening of the standard cotton flower market, American cotton rose slightly by one point per pound, while Indian cotton continued to fall by 1.75 to 2.25 rupees. Gold prices remained slightly lower. The number of sellers in the market decreased compared to the previous day. As distant-month yarn contracts strengthened, sentiment did not ease, resulting in gains of five fen to one jiao across all months. The afternoon session opened with tension as gold prices rebounded by approximately 10 yuan, and the unofficial market for Indian cotton rose by 0.75 rupees. It was also rumored that deliveries for the current month were limited, leading to scattered retail activity to cover positions, resulting in additional gains of two to three jiao across all months. Sales included: Run Kang, 5,700 dan; Da Fu, 1,700 dan; Geng Feng, 1,300 dan; Da Chang, 1,600 dan; Yuan Da, 2,700 dan; Tai Xing, 1,100 dan; Yuan Yi, 2,000 dan; and Xin Cheng, 1,100 dan. Purchases included: Da Fu, 1,100 dan; Mu Kang, 1,600 dan; Da Chang, 1,800 dan; Tai Chang, 1,100 dan; Tong Ji, 2,700 dan; Da Feng, 1,800 dan; Geng Feng, 1,000 dan; Jun Chang, 1,200 dan; and Tong Xing, 1,400 dan. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Cotton Flower Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Open Interest</p>
<p>February 36.45 36.20 36.45 Up 0.30 106,400</p>
<p>March 37.00 36.70 37.00 Up 0.35 137,900</p>

<p>July 37.80 37.60 37.80 Up 0.25 22,000</p>
<p>Total 520,700</p>
<p>Raw Cotton Factories Gradually Expanding Demand</p>
<p>Consumption of spot cotton is gradually increasing. Shen Xin, Heng Feng, and Gong Da factories have all made purchases, but sources are completely depleted.</p>
<p>Fire Machine Cotton 41.50 Shen Xin Factory Purchases 500 Bales Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Wooden Frame Cotton 42.50 Shen Xin Factory Purchases 500 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Zhangde Cotton 53.75 Shen Xin Factory Purchases 319 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<p>Shandong American Cotton 50.50 Heng Feng Factory Purchases 110 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Shashi Cotton 45.25 Gong Da Factory Purchases 1,000 Pieces Spot Delivery to Factory</p>
<p>Overseas Cotton Markets Fluctuate Slightly</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with prices falling by one to four points. Trading activity was limited, as operators awaited developments in Washington regarding the gold standard. Subsequently, due to poor news from Liverpool and selling by foreign firms, the market weakened. Domestic firms bought near-month contracts, and New Orleans and local firms also made purchases. Combined with a rebound in wheat and stocks, market conditions rebounded. There were few sellers, and foreign firms continued to sell. The closing was firm, with weak current demand but solid fundamentals. The textile industry remained quiet. Spot prices remained unchanged, while futures rose by one to three points. The English cotton market was weak, with spot prices falling by seven points and futures falling by two to three points. Indian cotton was bought by European exporters, but was overwhelmed by profit-taking and public selling. Ping Guolan fell by 2.25 rupees, while Aomula and Bai Luo Xi fell by 1.75 rupees. Original Telegram Left (Telegram dated the 13th)</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for Bai Luo Xi cotton on the 14th was 248 rupees, up 0.75 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grains: Du Rice Stagnant, Foreign Rice Sells Well</h3>
<p>Du Rice: Yesterday's supplies from South Shanghai were similar to previous days, remaining around the 22nd or 23rd grade (totaling nearly 4,000 shi). Sales were also sluggish. Business on this street was slow, with customers only buying two to three hundred bags. As a result, the market consistently showed weakness, and it seemed unlikely to improve soon. Consequently, prices for thick japonica rice fell slightly, while thin indica rice barely managed to maintain its near-ruler length. Du foreign pointed rice was scarce and inactive. The price of silver variant frequently showed weakness.</p>
<p>North Shanghai: Over ten boats arrived from Hexia. The market was extremely sluggish. In addition to a small drop in the price of medium-grade white japonica rice, early indica rice from Xidun and Jiashan early indica rice fell short by seven or eight fen, and silver variant was slightly soft. Other prices were flat or weak. However, shipments of top-grade thin indica rice were scarce, and sales were active, leading to tight prices. Top-grade sheep pointed rice has been scarce since the market opened. It was first seen on the market yesterday, so the price was firm.</p>
<p>Foreign Rice: Market conditions and customer demand remain stable. Demand from various ports along the Shanghai-Ningbo and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines was particularly strong. Yesterday, merchants from Yongbo and Shaoxing were particularly active, making the market very lively. Among foreign rice, No. 3 Saigon was the most popular, driven by demand from disaster areas in the interior. Yesterday, over 20,000 bags of spot No. 3 Saigon were offered, and 300 tons of February futures were also traded. No. 1 and 2 Saigon, broken pointed rice, and broken rice were also offered, totaling seven or eight thousand bags. Over 4,000 bags of customer indica rice were offered. The demand for secret indica rice from Nanjing, Fuzhou, and the interior of this street remained strong, with high customer interest. However, as supplies did not surge, the market steadily improved. Although foreign rice generally showed an upward trend, abundant inventories and news reports of five or six million orders caused some anxiety. Therefore, aside from No. 3 Saigon, other varieties remained flat or weak. It is said that a portion of these large orders will be distributed to Zhejiang and Jiangxi provinces.</p>
<h3>Flour and Wheat Markets: Caution Prevails</h3>
<p>The flour market's pricing is based on foreign wheat quotations. Chicago rose by around two to three jiao, while Canada rose by around eight fen. After the opening prices were announced, the market atmosphere for the current month was calm as Tianjin merchants continued to purchase. Distant-month contracts, however, were affected by the large drop in gold prices and the increase in exchange rates, dampening bullish sentiment and causing the market to weaken. During the afternoon session, trading in all months became sluggish. Customer merchants had slight transactions in the current month, keeping the market flat. For distant-month contracts, the rising foreign exchange rates and slight selling pressure from factories made it difficult to stimulate the market. Future developments depend on the pricing of foreign wheat. Ultimately, the current month fell by one fen, March-April fell by 1.5 fen, May fell by two fen, June fell by one fen, and July fell by 1.5 fen.</p>
<p>The wheat market for all months was generally stagnant. The current month, being close to delivery, saw some delivery of Kuai goods, but with few receivers, long positions eased and the market weakened. For distant-month contracts, despite the potential for hedging with foreign wheat, merchants were unwilling to take risks during this volatile period. As a result, trading was slow and the market remained stable. Ultimately, the current month fell by two fen, March rose by one fen, and April fell by a small fen. The spot wheat market remained stable. Medium-grade wheat was offered at a discount of one to two fen, while high-quality wheat remained unchanged. 1,000 bags of Shandong Guizhou wheat were offered at 3.90 yuan, with the second grade at 0.80 yuan, reportedly purchased by Shen Da and Xin Da.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat: Commercial purchases are on the rise and remaining long positions have nearly cleared, laying groundwork for potential price increases.</p>
<p>Chicago Closing Prices February 12 February 13 Change</p>
<p>May 96.125 97.125 Up 1.00</p>
<p>July 89.25 90.00 Up 0.75</p>
<p>September 87.625 88.375 Up 0.75</p>
<p>Spot 104.375 105.25 Up 0.875</p>
<p>Canada Closing Prices February 12 February 13 Change</p>
<p>May 82.625 82.875 Up 0.25</p>
<p>July 82.00 82.25 Up 0.25</p>
<p>Spot 79.125 79.375 Up 0.25</p>
<p>Cake Sales Stalled</p>
<p>Soybean Sales Also Sluggish</p>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market weakened as cake sales from Shantou merchants ceased and soybean sales from factories were weak. Supplies continued to flow in, and standard beans also fell in the morning, dampening sentiment. The market continued to fall by two to three fen compared to the previous session. Hankou beans were even weaker due to large inventories and merchants selling off their holdings, causing prices to fall by six to seven fen. A total of four cars of Yingzhou beans were offered, with prices at 3.94 yuan and 3.93 yuan. Four cars of special high-quality aged beans were also traded at 4 yuan, all purchased by factories. Additionally, two cars of Dalian Sipingjie beans were sold at 4.35 yuan. Over 400 bags of Xicheng beans were sold on this street at 4.70 yuan. Merchants from the interior and this street purchased over 2,000 bags of Hankou Zha beans, with prices ranging from 3.72 to 3.65 yuan. Merchants from Fuzhou purchased over 60 bags of Hankou Di beans at 3.67 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Chaoqing Local Prices Continue to Rise</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was generally weak except for domestic Chaoqing sugar, which showed some strength due to rising local prices. The Chamber of Commerce set the price of No. 24 raw sugar at 17.70 yuan and transit goods at 5 yuan. No. 8 and 9 Dutch red sugar was priced at 4.55 yuan, but there were no transactions. Taikoo sugar was not offered due to activity in inferior goods, reportedly priced at only 18 yuan. The factory's refined sugar also appeared likely to continue falling. According to telegrams from Shantou, Chaoqing prices rose by five fen at the high end and one jiao at the low end. Scattered transactions of Zhiyang sugar occurred in the unofficial market, with prices slightly lower than before. Given the current situation, it will be difficult for prices to rebound until sales improve. On the same day, the Jardine Matheson vessel "Ze Sheng" imported 1,200 pieces of Chaoqing and other sugars, a small amount.</p>
<h3>Dried Goods: White Lotus Local Prices Rebound</h3>
<p>White lotus seeds were previously priced at 48 yuan locally, so the first sale in Shanghai reached 52 yuan. Yesterday, according to a letter from Lanxi, prices had rebounded by about two yuan, so prices in this market also slightly decreased. However, as inventories remain low, the trend remains stable.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Silk Market Rises Briefly Before Returning to Sluggishness</h3>
<p>After the opening of the year 24, the silk market once soared and transactions were very booming. Since the abolishment of the old calendar year-end and New Year's Day and the increase in foreign exchange rates, the market has been sluggish. In recent days, there have only been sporadic transactions, and the market atmosphere is not as strong as before. The total number of raw silk exports in the upper and lower halves of January showed that exports to the United States had increased slightly compared to before. From January 16 to January 31, a total of 1,494 bales of raw silk and 1,369 bales of waste silk were exported.</p>

<h3>Hardware: British Galvanized Iron Prices Fall Sharply</h3>
<p>Since the influx of Eastern goods, the price of British galvanized iron has been hit hard, and the market has fallen. However, sales have not improved, likely due to the continued financial constraints since the New Year. Yesterday's market price, such as the 7-foot Hongdao brand, was estimated at 1.30 yuan, a drop of 0.15 yuan compared to the negotiated price. No. 28 thick-colored iron sold for 13.50 yuan, No. 26 for 12.50 yuan, and No. 24 for 11.50 yuan, slightly lower than before. It was reported that only 240 to 250 dan were traded sporadically, and there were no large-scale transactions. However, as the Eastern goods market has been unusually sluggish in recent days, the situation for British goods is unlikely to improve.</p>

<h3>The Two Sides of Believing in Natural Forces</h3>
<p>— Ling Mo</p>
<p>Although "modernity," in the terms of historians and anthropologists, is called the age of civilization and is the highest era of enlightenment known to modern people, distinguishing it from the age of barbarism, the physiology of modern people is almost entirely that of barbarians. The psychology of modern people, although more complex, if we admit that the barbarian's invention of ironmaking and the modern invention of changing elements are equally difficult, then we have little to boast about to the barbarians. The greatest effort the barbarians pursued was food, and the greatest effort we spend now is also in food and goods. The barbarians did not hesitate to wage war to obtain food and goods, and we often wage war now, and it is almost the same meaning.</p>
<p>Naturally, we no longer believe that war is ordained by fate. The display of celestial phenomena can be said to be where we differ from the barbarians. Neglecting the power of nature and fighting against nature is indeed something modern people can be proud of. But while we have partially been able to control nature by fighting against it, on the other hand, we have found that there are still too many places where nature is difficult to control. We still cannot help but be afraid of what disasters nature will give us. In this regard, we are not very different from the barbarians. Recently, someone said that the increase in sunspots will cause changes in electromagnetic lines and make people crazy, leading to war, which can be said to be this kind of psychology. But rather than saying that astronomers are trying to add a new explanation to the universally recognized inevitable war, or frankly mocking it as returning to barbarism and attributing it to fate, it is better to say that he discovered another place where "nature" must be controlled and is trying to control it. Because we are not all barbarians after all.</p>
<p>The achievements of the twentieth century in optics are indeed not small, but now it can only be said to be in the budding stage, so for some difficult-to-understand properties, there is only a feeling of mystery and surprise, and for its function, there are often speculative inferences that exceed imagination. Some of them are indeed based on reliable evidence. Now that we know that there is a kind of light (death ray) that can destroy life, then the question of whether there are other kinds of light that can affect human physiology will arise even in the absence of evidence. The claim that electromagnetic lines - or some kind of electromagnetic line - can drive people crazy is merely a fantasy of ordinary people, or does it have a scientific basis of its own? We cannot say until we know the details. But now there are people who want to discover a kind of line and use it to make people have psychological changes. If electromagnetic lines have this effect, then the effect of natural electromagnetic lines on life, even if it is very small, may be able to create a terror greater than the death ray when human power can control it. We do not believe that this will happen now. Perhaps it is not the smartest way, unless we are smart enough to understand light beyond the existing knowledge. We still do not know if there is anything external that directly governs the heart, but this problem will eventually be solved.</p>
<p>However, there must be a reason why the idea that sunspots affect human affairs is despised, because what the telecommunications transmitted has not added any novel reasons, but can be regarded as the resurrection of an old saying that is already dead. Former economists had attributed the cause of the economic panic that occurs about every ten years to the contraction of sunspots. We now know that it is only a cyclical coincidence, just as the "Napoleon's odd numbers" can be used to calculate the years in which Britain participated in the war as if. (See page 53 of the Supplement to the Shen Bao Monthly, Issue 30. The sum of the four numbers of a certain year used in it will not be less than eight or nine and will not exceed twenty-seven at the end of the nineteenth century. At the beginning of the twentieth century, it will be no less than ten and will not exceed twenty-one. Therefore, the number is probably seventeen or eighteen years, which is about the same as the interval between the two wars. Therefore, there may be a coincidence.) If this is really the case, it is naturally not credible at all. But we know that the appearance of the panic cycle theory was in the eighteenth century, when everything was believed to operate mechanically, and the cycle of sunspots had just been discovered, so there was such a novel inference. Now, although it is strange but not new, no one actually wants to revive it. But now there is a trend to believe that the quality points of light (usually still said to be waves) dominate everything, so talking about the influence of sunspots on human affairs is not talking about cycles but talking about electromagnetic lines. So this statement at least contains a background of the times.</p>
<p>If science is the religion of modern people, then it is inevitable that modern people will be superstitious about science with the same confidence that barbarians believe in fate. The actual reasons for wars between barbarians and civilized people are almost the same, but because the background is more complex, the explanation of this fate is also more complex than simple, and there is no other way except for barbarians to insist on their beliefs.</p>
<h3>We Eight</h3>
<p>— Ye Cao</p>
<p>We eight: Tu Er, Xiao Bing, Lai Wang, Da Xing, Hai Jing, Chun Shan, Mu Xing, and me, together, we are together all year round. Wandering, using begging to spend our days.</p>
<p>All eight are the same: together they are less than sixteen years old, have no home, and are all orphans. Once, Tu Er was fighting with Xiao Bing for a piece of rotten salted meat, and Xiao Bing cursed with uncontainable anger:</p>
<p>"I × your mother—Tu Er, you snatched mine!"</p>
<p>Tu Er did not curse back, biting his lower lip, jumped up with all his might, grabbed Xiao Bing and beat him hard. Everyone's advice was in vain. They tore at each other, beat each other, cursed each other, and fought into a ball. It was not until Xiao Bing's nose was beaten with blood that Tu Er let go.</p>
<p>In the evening, we eight, like eight stray dogs, huddled in a small corner. We have nothing, only using ragged sacks to house our hands and feet: the wind, like a cold snake, mercilessly drills into our sacks, flowing, making us unable to get warm all night.</p>
<p>We opened our eyes that are not often wiped, and peered at each other in the blurry night. Sixteen young ears were all listening to the somber sound of the wind sent over from the forest. Truly, because the history of our lives has lost its hope, we are even more thinking of our parents.</p>
<p>We are people from Jiao Village near Changchun. We eight have been together since we were young. Years of fighting destroyed our home. Our house was burned to the ground on that evening. Where are our parents? Only Heaven knows. But we eight are always thinking of them!</p>
<p>Wandering, the days of begging seem to have no end. Temples and abandoned houses have become our home. In the past, although our home was not very good, we had a kang in winter and did not worry about food. But now, we wear ragged clothes all year round. Except in summer, our feet and hands are always broken, flowing with that bright red blood.</p>
<p>We hate the Japanese devils to the bone. We are not afraid of him at all. We also hate ourselves, hate that we are too young and have no power. We are optimistic. We have not forgotten our hatred for a single day. We keep it in our hearts. We fight, we quarrel, but we will forget it the next day. Because of a scolding, we will become more intimate.</p>
<p>When Changchun was renamed Xinjing, we eight; together, set off for there. On the road, of course, we are still begging. Tu Er begged for two hot steamed buns and gave them to Xiao Bing first. Taking them over, this kid actually smiled.</p>
<p>We were kicked by the Japanese police and left Xinjing only after each of us had gotten many bruises. We eight stood there messily, then looked at those puppet policemen with eyes full of anger:</p>
<p>"When we grow up, wait and see..."</p>
<h3>Symphony of Hutongs</h3>
<p>— Hu Sheng</p>
<p>Living in an apartment in Beiping, one never feels lonely.</p>
<p>Previously, I lived in a small apartment where a gentleman in the neighboring room could sing famous songs like "Drizzling Rain" and "Peach Blossom River" by imitating a woman's voice. There was also someone who would open his mouth wide to sing roles from Peking Opera. However, since moving to this apartment, I haven't heard any singing or opera. It seems that the people living in this apartment are neither modern youths nor Beijingers. Because all modern youths should be able to sing "famous songs," and those who don't play stringed instruments or hum a couple of opera lines can't be considered Beijingers.</p>
<p>Although the apartment is quiet, living in it, one still doesn't feel lonely.</p>
<p>The sounds from the hutongs never cease. These sounds are completely different from the "city sounds" heard in Shanghai's garret rooms—the sounds of cars, trams, heavy trucks, noisy people, factory whistles… the kind that make your head swell.</p>
<p>Carrying items to sell, either pushing them in carts or holding them in their hands, peddlers travel from one hutong to another—these peddlers seem more numerous in Beiping than in the south. Customers can't be found inside the hutongs; they have to raise their voices so that people inside houses one or two courtyards away from the gate can hear them. Naturally, these cries are exceptionally loud and have long trailing notes. They are less inclined to use other tools, like the bamboo clappers or small gongs used in the south. Of course, there are those who don't rely on their voices, such as knife sharpeners who use a thin, arm-length horn that makes a wailing sound, monotonous yet extremely piercing.</p>
<p>Each type of merchandise has its own special phrases and tones. When I first came to Beiping, I could hardly understand any of these peddling cries. Now, although I understand a little better, there are still some I can't decipher. Or, even if I know what they're selling, I can only put "under consideration" what exactly they're shouting.</p>
<p>When reading or writing in the room, occasionally looking up, I hear one or two drawn-out cries, climbing over walls, passing through empty courtyards, and reaching my ears. The sounds might be "Roasted sweet potatoes... really hot..." or "Squeezed tofu..." or "Water chestnuts—sweeter than pears..."... Sometimes, several sounds alternate, echoing in the air. If the sound comes from a nearby hutong, naturally it's much softer, but it also seems especially distant. All the cries are so leisurely, as if sounds falling into empty cans—yes, the city of Beiping is like a hollow, large can, and these peddling cries just swirl and ripple inside this large can.</p>
<p>Those who sell roasted sweet potatoes push their carts, so naturally, they can only walk in the hutongs. But those who carry their wares in their hands, like those who sell what's called "candied hawthorns" in the south, can enter the apartment complex. They make a turn in the courtyard, softly calling, "Candied haws—rock candy." Don't think they can't shout loudly; once they exit the apartment gate, another cry of "Candied haws—rock candy" sounds much louder to you than when they shouted in front of your window. But the sounds gradually diminish; when the sound becomes very faint, you can imagine that they have finished walking this hutong and turned into another one.</p>
<p>There are also newspaper sellers who come to the apartment complex. Around eight or nine in the morning, an old man carrying only two or three newspapers walks into my apartment. He invariably says only three sentences: "Who wants a newspaper? Who wants a newspaper? Anyone want a newspaper?" After he says this if no one comes out to buy one, he quietly leaves. This is very different from the Shanghai newspaper boys who frantically shout "Want to read Shen Bao News..." in front of the Rising Sun Building. It shows a clear difference between the "Beijing style" and the "Shanghai style."</p>
<p>With such constant sounds as companions, one really won't feel lonely living in the apartment—although perhaps it's precisely because of these drawn-out sounds that people sitting idly in the apartment feel an emptiness and a sense of loss.</p>
<p>Because the apartment where I live is close to the main road, I can sometimes hear the sounds of cars passing by. On evenings when the wind is favorable, I can even hear the sounds of trams running from farther away—but once these sounds fall into the hollow, large urn that is the city of Beiping, they don't exhibit even a trace of urban atmosphere.</p>
<h3>Mask</h3>
<h3>Altitude (4)</h3>
<p>— (Henri Barbusse) Translated by Di Zhou</p>
<p>Thus, parallel to civilization, we fly through the night.</p>
<p>We, on that side of the black and gloomy space, looked far into civilization with giant currents of electric lights. Across the eternally dark veils, we flew over the zigzagging edges of shining Europe.</p>
<p>Through the telescope, cities appeared. Cities, at first, were faintly glowing lakes in the darkness, then turned into milky screens, and soon, soon became constellations. In order to distinguish the constellations of the sky, hidden at our fingertips, and superficially enumerated, we recognized the constellations by their Arabic patterns.</p>
<p>When flying at low altitude, the glossy, luminous planks of cities showed the same shape, even in the smallest parts. Paris, Berlin, Budapest, Vienna. All these cities looked like fireworks set off chemically on the ground.</p>
<p>Then we rose again into the "night" congealed on the hemisphere of the earth—looking down, we were astronomers of light, writing magnificent literature. We remembered the ancient Jehovah of legends, looking down at the stars from the heavens.</p>
<p>However, often, we overlooked the jewel-like signs engraved on many continents. These real names were completely forgotten, and we lost our sense of the aerial framework.</p>
<p>At night, we descended to the ground (along the edges of the constellation belt) from the center. From far away, they saw our point, saw a star penetrating among the many stars. Saw a star moving more slowly than the others. The light of the searchlight caught us. A tunnel of light. The light of the small lampposts made white stripes that divided the hemisphere of night diagonally. This white rope connected our place to the world of the full moon. When we stood on the ground and looked out, it seemed that half-black and half-white humans were moving on this surface of the lunar world.</p>
<p>Once again, we proceeded toward the sun, toward the surface of the earth, like a road covered with glory. This was also a wandering above the deeply slumbering reality, starting at night.</p>
<p>Looking out at this geographical sky, at the momentary flashes of interrupted emotion, when only a single planetary dot was searched for in the vast expanse of the universe, when we stood above it, we wanted to know: the things happening in the unclear places. We already knew those things. But at the same time, we also didn't know. We knew that every night, as the ceremony began, joyful transactions took place in the boundless darkness. We were sure that everywhere in all the cities where the germs of civilization were congealed, it was the same, and that in every place, human life was a prisoner's life. But this was only what the brain knew. Why, because the deep abyss of night also embraced the prisoners of the prison. Although night knows of the existence of people, it cannot see their forms. We wave our hands at what we cannot see and hold what we do not know in our arms. People want to lift the veil of darkness or want to get advanced words.</p>
<p>Soon, dawn approached. We walked along the gray latitude. The waves of vision galloped freely. From our bustling actions, the images of the fields appeared—the appearances of plains. Or the zones of land painted like openly unfolded oil paintings (farms), or the zones of thin and scabby filth (industry, mechanical rainstorms). Cities of whitened and blackened skeletal dregs floated up with violent inclinations. The strange city people thrown onto the streets from the morning... the people bound in the hell of the city—a dispersed, sandy crowd. Here, the monument to the war dead—the color of bones, the offerings of the rich. And there, the ugly bears of the rich were exposed and their drunken state was still in anger. Many filthinesses crawled in the small streets and alleys. But only the rational eye can see. We discovered and walked back. We had no leftover feelings and quickly passed through.</p>
<p>After a moment of shock, we quickly flew at low altitude. The eyes of the skyscrapers also touched us in a momentary darkness. In front of the high windows. Our vision flew swiftly into it. On top of all the equipment in the banks, in front of the vaults, behind the equipment for the mechanical setup of the offices, were pale people. A golden bull. That man was throwing the lines of the telegraph and telephone, like the silk of spiders. Above those collectives (above the glass windows) golden words were written.</p>
<p>—Jupiter (God of Heaven)</p>
<p>He chattered. But, what exactly was he chattering? (End)</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Common Etiquette Among the People</h3>
<p>— Wan</p>
<p>In ancient times, after achievements were established, rites and music were created, calendars were corrected, clothing styles were changed, a model for a generation was established, and standards for governing the country were determined. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, military affairs have been pressing, leaving no time for administrative governance. Therefore, there are still no legal standards for folk etiquette and clothing. People act as they please and families follow their own rules, without a fixed framework.</p>
<p>Recently, the Legal Committee of the Legislative Yuan appointed Jiao Yitang, Peng Yangguang, and twelve other committee members to study the case of common etiquette among the people and convened meetings to discuss drafting methods. Thus, common etiquette among the people may soon be stipulated. Because without government regulations on etiquette, the people do not know what to do, either continuing the old customs of the Qing Dynasty, imitating the systems of Europe and America, or simply mixing old and new, combining Chinese and Western styles, resulting in a colorful variety that is bewildering. Therefore, the regulation of etiquette and clothing is a matter that brooks no delay.</p>
<p>Jiao stated in his report at the Legislative Yuan Memorial Week the other day that regulating etiquette can promote loyalty and filial piety among the people, and defining clothing can maintain national dignity. Indeed, the people of today pay too little attention to the words "loyalty and filial piety." The so-called duties of serving parents and respecting elders have completely disappeared. Promoting loyalty and filial piety among the people is a matter of urgent importance. However, what etiquette can express is only a form of formalism, and the spiritual promotion of it relies even more on the encouragement of education. In my opinion, common etiquette should be simple and easy to implement. For example, the old system of the Qing Dynasty can be said to have promoted loyalty and filial piety to the extreme, but its effectiveness is self-evident. Therefore, when stipulating the current etiquette, we should first reject all the previous hypocritical systems and replace them with etiquette that emphasizes spirit and practicality, so as to fully express the atmosphere of a new life movement.</p>
<p>As for the system of clothing, it is also necessary to consider it in detail. Our country has always been known as an ancient civilization, with superior national attire, wide robes and broad sleeves, and square steps and measured movements. If it is not like this, it is not enough to show the attitude of our great citizens. In the current trend, this kind of measured step, nose-wiping, and affectation is probably somewhat out of date. We should now promote martial spirit and a lively temperament, and should not promote rigid and corrupt life again. Last year, this magazine advocated a short-clothes life. As a result of research, the majority advocated that the clothes should be only about two or three inches past the knee, with a Chinese-style buttoned front. Recently, the clothing system of a certain province's New Life Movement is also similar to what this magazine advocates. Roughly speaking, they like convenience and fear being burdened, and their psychology is similar.</p>
<p>The current ordinary clothing system is either Western suits or blue robes and black jackets: completely Westernized, which is not enough to express our country's special etiquette. The blue robes and black jackets were also the formal attire of the Qing Dynasty's consultative council. This kind of clothing system is, on the one hand, not close to national conditions, and on the other hand, completely corrupt. It seems that neither should be adopted again. In the past, King Zhao Wuling advocated wearing barbarian clothes to educate the people. Now that our country is in a situation of military oppression, we should encourage and promote martial arts in order to save the country's precarious situation, so we should also pay attention to the clothing system.</p>
<h3>The Art of Buying Used Books</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>When you don't have money to buy books, even used books are good. In Shanghai, you can find countless used book stalls, and these places can often satisfy your not-so-extravagant desires. For example, if you go to North Sichuan Road, in addition to the fixed used bookstores, you can see many book stalls. A book of philosophy with a moralistic face can stand side by side with enchanting erotic series. Classical thread-bound books and imported crab-walking text can also become friends. These merchants don't know how to choose, and they won't choose. Books from ancient and modern times, from China and abroad, from the three religions and nine streams are all in one place, and nothing else can express the "Great Harmony Spirit" of treating everyone equally. They didn't organize them, but this is like a country girl who has a special charm in her plain clothes. It's also like wild trees growing naturally in the valleys, not like those in the park that are trimmed so flat as if they've had their heads shaved. There, you can search freely, and maybe you'll discover an erotic secret book, or maybe you'll get a banned book that you can't buy anywhere else. Sometimes, you can buy a famous foreign work for just a few cents. Sometimes you can guess the original owner's identity from the stamps, signatures, or even inscriptions in the book. There are many such book stalls in North Sichuan Road, Fourth Horse Road, and the City God Temple area. It is said that London has streets dedicated to selling used books, and several shops can put together a complete set of Shakespeare. The banks of the Seine in Paris are full of used book stalls with rare classical masterpieces. We haven't been to these places, but based on our own experience at the stalls, the taste is probably not much different.</p>
<p>However, buying used books also requires the art of buying used books, because sometimes the bookseller is very cunning. If you don't deal with them properly, you'll suffer a big loss or get angry and walk away, losing the joy of buying used books. I'm telling you, just the maneuvering around the book stall is an art. From there, you can understand the principles of being a person. For example, if you want to buy used books, you have to frequent new bookstores, know which books are out of print, what the prices of those books are, and which bookstores offer discounts. Most importantly, make yourself an expert. Then, you go to the book stall, see the book you want to buy or that is worth buying, and don't say stupidly, "Oh my God! This is exactly what I need!" You have to use your "skill." For example, you pretend to be indifferent and put the book aside. When you're about to leave, you seem to casually ask for the price, and if you say too much, you might as well sneer and put the book down, quoting a random price. However, the difference shouldn't be too great or too decisive, otherwise, the price negotiation will become unmanageable. The most important thing to note here is that if you like the book, you might as well linger by the stall for a moment, but don't walk away because the price doesn't match and then come back. That way, the market price might go up again.</p>
<p>Whether a book is missing pages or has stains should be checked before returning the price, otherwise you may suffer a big loss. But you shouldn't pay too much attention to the book, making it look like you love it too much, and let your opponent peek out your inner secrets. It's best to search in the corners, where there may be rich mineral deposits buried. I remember that I got an original edition of an aesthetics book and two copies of an American ten-thousand-book series book for my friend from those unnoticed places and exchanged them for a few cents.</p>
<p>The art of buying books is complicated. To make an analogy, this is like a bloody battle. Whenever you overcome your opponent, you can return triumphantly with a victory song.</p>

<h3>On Intelligence</h3>
<p>— Hui Ren</p>
<p>Living in today's society, in the eyes of most people, is not satisfactory. The reasons are complicated, but in short, the vitality of life is somewhat lacking. According to fatalists, all of this is fate, because people are destined to suffer from birth, and the world is originally a sea of suffering.</p>
<p>But people are always intelligent and refuse to turn over in the sea of suffering and rush against the current. Needless to say, the wind is strong and the waves are high, even the tide of people running along with the suffering current is already surging like a mountain collapsing and the sea overturning, squeezing so tightly that there is not a single gap for you to pass through. If you are not swept into the seabed by the wind and waves, you will be flattened by the tide of people. It is not just drifting with the current, letting it fall, and besides the bitterness, there is no danger. Although the future is so long and boundless, compared to those who go against the current, it is much easier. So, intelligent people create an ideal world—a dream—outside of the real world out of the blue.</p>
<p>Dreams are indeed as free as can be. What you dare not do, you do; what you cannot do, you also do. The shortcomings of reality are all made up for in the dream. What is not enough, paint it; what is not perfect, change it. As long as you can think of it, you can plan all the restrictions of the system! There is no danger in this world, everything is free, unlike the restrictions in the current society. Looking up is a roof, looking down is a deep mountain; it seems that there, you are Jehovah, and you can control everything.</p>
<p>But putting it another way, the facts are always absolute, either positive or negative, and there is nothing in between. In short, one is a revolutionary warrior, and the other is a revolutionary traitor. Do you really want to create the victory in your dream from the failure in reality? You have to know that after the day, it is indeed the night; but after the night, it is still a day! Do you want to transcend yourself in reality? Humph, one times one is still equal to one.</p>
<p>Let me tell you, those who feel the pain of life's hesitation are not the coolies who are exploited every day, nor the capitalists who control the coolies, but the head-shakers standing by. They do not sympathize with the coolies who are sweating, but only worry that they will also fall into it.</p>
<p>Originally, removing the sweet illusion is even more terrifying; the smile in the dream is the source of bitter tears in reality.</p>
<p>If there is really a source of happiness in the world, it has to be excavated by human labor. If you want to dream of a source while sleeping in bed, it is too intelligent after all.</p>
<h3>On the Yi River</h3>
<p>— Chen Xuntao</p>
<p>Looking through the hazy smoke and dust in the airway, the Yi River flows like a snow-white silk practice from the gray horizon into the distant earth. The river tide slightly stirs milky white foam against the bleak wind of the northern country, like the fading white orchids on a widow's head, trembling and falling into scattered petals. Withdrawing his gaze, glancing around at the crowd of people in white robes who are seeing him off, in Jing Ke's eyes, they all seem to be mourners at his funeral, grieving for him. Their faces are all solemn and melancholic; especially Gao Jianli, the heroic spirit of singing with sorrow and generosity when drunk in the Yan City market, has also become desolate at this moment.</p>
<p>Jing Ke feels that this trip is too risky. He complains about Prince Dan for just this point. It is somewhat reckless to take the callow Qin Wuyang as his deputy, and go deep into the ferocious and powerful Qin with a short dagger. He believes that Prince Dan does not have a calm mind, a careful long-term vision, but is just a mediocre person whose emotions have surpassed his reason. He wholeheartedly wants to vent his anger for the Yan State and the weak vassal lords, but how has he considered the tyranny of the King of Qin, the ferocity of Wang Jian? The immaturity of Qin Wuyang, and even what unfortunate results will come of this trip, he has not even considered. Although Jing Ke, who has always prided himself on being generous and heroic, cannot help but feel sad about this in his heart!</p>
<p>Before his eyes, the vast Yi River connects to the sky, and the bare branches and trunks of the flat forest stand upright. A bleak view of desolation and decay... From now on, it will be farewell forever! Recalling the countless taverns in the Yan City, the places where he used to sing and weep with Gao Jianli and the dog butchers, he will never go there to look up and down and linger again! Raising his eyes and looking at the road ahead shrouded in smoke and dust, Jing Ke's vision was suddenly covered with a layer of hot, tearful moisture, and everything blurred past.</p>
<p>Scattered fallen leaves rolled up gently with the wind, and then ran wildly away. Grief came from Gao Jianli, and as soon as he hugged his zither, his hands were already trembling with excitement. Soft and pliable bamboo was drawn across the strings, involuntarily forming a changing tune; and Jing Ke's sorrowful singing was also filled with the endless sadness of life and death, the sorrow of leaving the country. Not only this crowd of people in white robes seeing him off, looking at each other sadly, wiping away a sympathetic tear for Jing Ke. Even the bleak cold wind was crying for him, and the sentimental fallen leaves used a rustling vibrato to mourn the sorrow of his future!</p>
<p>Jing Ke's singing voice was already choked up and he could not sing. Gao Jianli's zither sound suddenly turned from poignant to generous and solemn. Everything was silent, only this resolute sound powerfully stirred everyone's hearts, so solemn that no one dared to shed a cowardly tear.</p>
<p>Jing Ke slowly raised his head in extreme thought, his eyes making a tour around. He saw Prince Dan's doubtful and eager expression, Qin Wuyang's contemptuous gaze, and even the people seeing him off who had just sympathized with him, seemed to be secretly laughing there;</p>
<p>"Jing Qing is such a coward! Wang Jian's beast army is only separated by the Yi River, but he is shrinking back, avoiding it. Look at Qin Wuyang, this child, how brave he is! More bloody and more resolute than him!"</p>
<p>This was truly a great insult to Jing Ke. He hummed in his throat with self-confidence. His whole body trembled from excessive excitement, his protruding eyes burning with fierce anger, suddenly swinging his iron-like fist and hitting the air violently, opening his throat and shouting, roaring like a lion:</p>
<p>"The wind is soughing, the Yi River is cold, the hero goes forth, never to return!"</p>
<p>The voice was high-pitched and loud, reaching the blue clouds, and everyone's faces were so moved that they changed from melancholy to stern iron blue. The wind was howling, and the Yi River was surging with violent waves, as if the spirits of the great and magnificent rivers and mountains were also responding轰轰烈烈 with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Jing Ke took the two gifts: Fan Yuqi's head, this hated fugitive's head, trembling, and the Dukang map with a cold dagger inserted in it, patted Qin Wuyang's arm, and said:</p>
<p>"Let's go!" So resolutely.</p>
<p>The silhouette of the carriage had already disappeared in the distance. Prince Dan and the others, the group of people in white robes seeing him off, were still smiling as they watched the tracks of the carriage on the avenue. They were waiting for the tragic drama of the assassination of the warmonger to be staged in the Xianyang Palace when the dagger was revealed at the end of the map.</p>
<h3>From Inland Attacks to the City</h3>
<h3>Ginza Nights</h3>
<p>— Qian Hong</p>
<p>Ginza is the most bustling area in Tokyo. Therefore, any friend who comes to Tokyo knows that there is a place called Ginza and wants to take a stroll there. When I first arrived in Tokyo, I didn't mind the hard work and went to Ginza once.</p>
<p>It was a night with a hazy moon. Mr. Chen, the "old Tokyo-ite," and I strolled from Waseda to Hibiya, and then from Hibiya to Nihonbashi, and then to Ginza. Once in Ginza, the hazy moonlight was nowhere to be seen, replaced by the dazzling electric advertisements that crisscrossed the space like nets. Several major department stores, including Shirokiya, Matsuzakaya, and Mitsukoshi, were all concentrated here. The Japan Theater and Tokyo's most famous cafes and dance halls were also all here. Walking through such a lively area, it was just the time when the night market was opening. The roads were naturally filled with cars and horses, coming and going endlessly, and the sidewalks on both sides were as crowded as during temple fairs in the countryside. In the middle, separated from the roads and sidewalks, were rows of night market stalls. On these stalls, there was everything from daily necessities, food, toys, books, and night clothes to antiques. Although the goods were no different from those sold in companies or shops, the prices were more than 20% cheaper. Therefore, people living in Tokyo all knew the benefits of going to the night market to buy things, and they weren't afraid of the crowds and came to the streets when the night market opened. We walked slowly, like country bumpkins entering the city for the first time, carefully observing everything. We learned that no matter what they sold, they used practical experiments to advertise. For example, if you bought a newly invented compass or a water pipe connected to a tap at a stall, the stallholder would tell you in detail how to use it and show you the results of the experiment. This was indeed a very good business method. When we turned onto the left sidewalk from Shinbashi, in that corner stood two young men with artist-like hair, trying to sell us their works. Ah! So these were the street artists I had often seen in books. Driven by hunger and cold, they came to the streets to sell their art at extremely cheap prices. Among the few portraits hanging there, I recognized one of Kan Kikuchi. Although the painting technique wasn't very skilled, the brushstrokes were very lively. The portrait of Kikuchi Kan was also very lifelike. Therefore, I spent ten minutes and two jiao to have them draw a quick sketch of me, and then bought a frame from another stall. In total, it only cost me five jiao to get such a perfect thing, which I could never get in Shanghai. Finally, Mr. Chen took me to one of the largest tea houses, where I drank a cup of coffee and feasted my eyes on beautiful scenery. Only then did I leave Ginza with a tired body and an excited heart.</p>

<h3>What is My Ambition?</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Although I have never met you, I often see your correct answers in the newspaper, which have long made me admire you immensely.</p>
<p>I now have a few questions that I would like you to explain to me. Let me first describe my situation: My parents are both alive, both over fifty years old. I have two siblings, and we make a living by farming to support the family. After graduating from elementary school, due to financial difficulties, I was unable to continue to middle school, so I had to leave my books and enter this dark society, hoping to acquire a skill to comfort my parents' high expectations. I am now working as an apprentice, earning nine yuan a month. From this small amount, I also have to supplement the family expenses, so my finances are very tight. However, I am not discouraged by the difficult environment; I want to strive forward. I think that a person standing in society cannot live solely for the sake of bread; at least they must seek some benefits for society and some happiness for the country, only then is there meaning. Therefore, I want to take advantage of this vigorous time, using my brains and sweat, to work hard according to my firm ambition. However, in my heart, I don't know what my ambition is? How can I achieve my goal? Therefore, I am writing to you, earnestly asking for an indication to lead me towards a bright future. At the same time, I was born in this era of frequent disasters, driven by the environment, various contradictory thoughts are spinning in my mind all day long. I often wonder what kind of ideology is needed by China? This really makes me extremely bewildered. I think you are knowledgeable and experienced, and you will surely give me a clear explanation! Respectfully,</p>
<p>Xu Xing</p>
<p>Editor's Note: It is commendable that you can have a positive and enterprising spirit in a difficult environment.</p>
<p>You said: "A person standing in society cannot live solely for the sake of bread; at least they must seek some benefits for society and some happiness for the country." This is very true.</p>
<p>You want to take advantage of your vigorous time, using your brains and sweat, to work hard according to your firm ambition: but you yourself do not know what your ambition is, so you do not know if you can achieve your goal. These words are not correct. First, a person's ambition must be found in society. Relying solely on inner fantasies will not lead to any correct ambition. Second, you yourself "do not know what my ambition is," then how can you "work hard for a firm ambition"? What goal can be achieved?</p>
<p>You also said: "I often see your correct answers in the newspaper, which have long made me admire you immensely," "earnestly asking for an indication," "lead me towards a bright future." Here, I want to advise you: do not blindly believe in me, just as you should not blindly believe in any individual. If my words make sense, then believe in those principles; blindly worshipping an individual is a very dangerous thing!</p>
<p>Now is the time when theories are divergent, and it is also the time when everyone is trying to find a way out for China, and it is even more so the time when the whole world is finding a way out in panic. Nothing has reached the final stage, so at present, if you ask me what ideology is needed by China, then I cannot answer you.</p>
<p>However, you yourself should work hard to study this question, because you yourself also have a method to answer this question. This best method is to open your eyes and investigate the facts of society. Whichever ideology is compatible with the facts, then that ideology is what China needs. Using this method, not only will you be able to get a very correct answer in the future, but the majority of the Chinese people, undoubtedly, will also get the same answer in the future. Because there is only one fact, and there will only be one answer in the future.</p>
<p>But you should not rely solely on your personal naked eye to determine everything, because what the naked eye sees is sometimes just a superficial appearance of reality: and relying solely on personal investigation is also limited. Therefore, you should also read more books. At the same time, you should also study the process of social development and grasp the important points of current society. In this way, your ambition in the future will definitely be very firm and very correct, and your goal can definitely be achieved.</p>

<p>Those in ancient times who wished to manifest their clear virtue throughout the world first governed their states. Those who wished to govern their states first regulated their families. Those who wished to regulate their families first cultivated their personal lives. Those who wished to cultivate their personal lives first rectified their hearts. Those who wished to rectify their hearts first made their intentions sincere. Those who wished to make their intentions sincere first extended their knowledge. The extension of knowledge lies in the investigation of things.</p>
<p>To manifest clear virtue throughout the world is to enable all people to have the means to manifest their clear virtue. The heart is what governs the body. Sincerity is truthfulness. Intention is what the heart manifests. To make the heart's intentions truthful is to desire that they are always satisfied and without self-deception. To extend is to exhaust. Knowledge is understanding. To exhaust our knowledge is to desire that what we know is all-encompassing. To investigate is to arrive at. Things are events. To exhaust the principles of things is to desire that no extreme is left unreached. These eight are the items of the Great Learning.</p>

<h3>London, the World Film Center, Will Replace Hollywood</h3>
<p>— Chen Xiong</p>
<p>I once told readers in this publication that British filmmakers had officially launched an attack on the United States, seeking to open up theaters in major American cities. Now, a year later, British films have not only established a solid foundation in the American market, but London, the production center of British films, is poised to become the world's film center, replacing the authority of Hollywood, the only film city for decades.</p>
<p>In the past year, the rapid progress of the British film industry has been more significant than in the previous twenty years. After several years of desperate struggle, British productions have achieved great success in the American market. George Arliss—one of the best actors in Britain—shone like a shooting star, suddenly acquiring the qualification for the highest salary of Hollywood actors and appearing on the British silver screen. The completion of his latest British production, "The Iron Duke," made American filmmakers pale in comparison. When the salaries of British actors can be equal to those received by Hollywood, it can prove that British filmmakers have sufficient economic preparation to compete with Hollywood.</p>
<p>It is not surprising that George Arliss—an artist qualified to be elected to the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences—was recruited by British filmmakers. What shocked the American film industry the most was that Hollywood's top director Ernst Lubitsch was also recently lured to Britain. Lubitsch's reputation warrants the British film industry's considerable appeal to lure this talented director. Now that the best actors and the most famous directors in the United States have come to the British silver screen, there is no choice but to have bright prospects for the future development of British films.</p>
<p>These two famous figures in the film industry will all take London as the base for their development, and it is expected that they will add a unique color to the British film industry. Due to the precedent set by Arliss and Lubitsch, perhaps many American stars, directors, photographers, screenwriters, and other talents will jointly join the British film industry. At that time, British filmmakers will truly be able to be proud for a while. Now, American production companies, seeing the current situation, are all surprised by the new situation of the British film industry's courage and progress. The proud attitude of looking down on British films has now changed to admiration and suspicion.</p>
<p>Currently, at least ten British film companies are releasing their productions around the world, while the American film industry, which has always been dominant in the world film industry, has only eight major film companies. London's "The Private Life of Henry VIII" and "The Rise of Catherine the Great" are both works that have caused a sensation in the world film industry in recent years. Gaumont's "Man of Aran" is the British work that won the championship at the recent International Film Exhibition in Rome. There is also a "Chu Chin Chow," in which Chinese actress Anna May Wong participated in the performance, and is now being screened in New York's largest cinema, and is the masterpiece of the Gaumont Company. On the day of the premiere, President Roosevelt personally visited and praised the British work. Until recently, "Chu Chin Chow" was still a sold-out show in New York, so other city theaters are impatiently waiting for the British film to be screened in their area.</p>
<p>The British film industry is also working hard on publicity. Currently, the largest advertisements in American newspapers and theater advertisements are for British films. When Gaumont Film Company began setting up distribution offices in the United States last year, it ran several issues of color page advertisements in the most widely circulated film publications in the United States. This was a precursor for the American film industry to feel that its territory had been diligently sown. In the past, newspapers did not publish news about British films. Now, British film reviews, photos of British stars, and news about the British film industry are all materials that American newspapers like to publish.</p>
<p>Hu Die's performance in this film is quite successful, portraying the elegance of Ren Zhu as a young girl and the dignity of her as a young woman. The performance of Cui'er, the uneasy maid, and the kindness of Madame Youlan are all very successful. Gao Zhanfei's performance is not special, but he is dutiful. Xuan Jinglin maintains his past achievements, and Yan Yuexian's performance is very outstanding.</p>
<p>The sound and photography are clear, the lighting is perfect, and the shots are lively.</p>
<h3>My Thoughts on "Orchid in the Valley"</h3>
<p>— Zhou Hui</p>
<p>First of all, I should say that the clarity of the pronunciation and the fluency of the dialogue in this film are rare in domestic films.</p>
<p>The director does not have anything particularly commendable here. He simply presented the performance in a straightforward manner, without any lightheartedness, briskness, or compactness. There is no talk of film art techniques here. However, the interspersed gimmicks have harmonized the overall sad atmosphere quite a bit, and this is quite an achievement.</p>
<p>There are two points here that are confusing: (1) Where did Rouyun's murder weapon—the pistol—come from? It was not mentioned on the screen and came strangely. (2) Ji Lansun was originally a revolutionary who participated in the Northern Expedition, but later he was just a young man who talked about love and indulged in pleasure. The personality is too contradictory before and after.</p>
<p>In terms of actors, Hu Die is average. She is competent in playing the graceful and wealthy Ren Zhu, and her lines are also lively. Gao Zhanfei has nothing to commend. Yan Yuexian is very successful. Xuan Jinglin did not disappoint either.</p>
<p>As for the few songs interspersed in the film, they can be said to be superfluous and unnecessary. The photography is average. The set is very gorgeous.</p>
<h3>The Interweaving of French Law and Love in "A Scandalous Affair"</h3>
<p>— Yunmen</p>
<p>Shouldn't the responsibility of a lawyer who protects human rights be to strive for fair legal sanctions for the weak who have been wronged, and to exhaust his intelligence in defense? Should a beautiful young woman enjoy the right to youth and seek affection? Should an unfortunate girl sacrifice her chastity and money for the sake of great love? If that lawyer, due to business relations, throws himself into the inescapable net of a romantic wealthy woman and becomes her prisoner of love, and at the same time discovers that the main culprit in a certain case is his own beloved wife, then what should he—the human rights protector—do? If that passionate young woman, unable to withstand the temptation of spring, blindly abandons her family and reputation, seeking a like-minded partner, and discovers that he is a rascal who extorts money, then what will she do? And if that girl, after her reputation is ruined and her money is exhausted, realizes that her lover is just a vampire, then what can she do? These are all unsolvable problems in "A Scandalous Affair." However, murderers die, and there are constant punishments in the law. Wives who are unfaithful and husbands who are disloyal are also rejected by public opinion. How much benefit do parasites who rely on selling love take?</p>
<p>William Powell and Myrna Loy, in response to repeated requests from the audience, co-starred in this "A Scandalous Affair" through the efforts of MGM. William Powell and Myrna Loy are a pair of on-screen lovers who are considered the most suitable and satisfactory by the audience. Therefore, his and her first production, "Manhattan Melodrama," received extraordinary praise, and the second collaboration, "The Thin Man," changed the style of detective films. At the same time, the success of their collaboration also laid a solid foundation. Sure enough, the third collaborative film "A Scandalous Affair" was released. After seeing such a bizarre and tortuous plot, we certainly trust his and her talents and determine that it can surpass the previous work and satisfy the eager desire of our movie fans.</p>
<h3>Review of "Three Heroes of the Barren Desert"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>Ｔhe　Three　Musketeers</p>
<p>——Paris</p>
<p>After watching this film, I am almost speechless. On one hand, the so-called martial arts films are ultimately tiresome. On the other hand, the film itself is very empty. We cannot demand substantial content from every film, but this film, besides showing imperialist soldiers jokingly killing people in the colonies, hardly presents a complete story. Otherwise, if there is a story, then due to the chaotic weaving and the immature presentation methods, it fails to give us a relatively unified impression.</p>
<p>As a martial arts film, "Three Heroes of the Barren Desert" gives people the impression that the horsemanship is very good, and the several fight scenes are also very realistic. However, what I want to talk about here is not these, but the scenery in the desert. The fierce battle at the beginning of the film seems quite vivid, but that's just about it. Later, it just develops with Cut Cut, and the story is not narrated very clearly.</p>
<p>If we study Montage, the Cut o Cut of the silent film era often evokes our memories. Nowadays, due to the progress of expressive techniques, people have mostly forgotten that method. Therefore, although "Three Heroes of the Barren Desert" also uses very few "wipes" and Dissolves, it still attracts our attention. However, it hasn't even managed to narrate the story clearly, so there's nothing else to talk about.</p>
<p>Audience Opinions</p>
<h3>Thoughts After Watching "Orchid in the Empty Valley"</h3>
<p>— Yu Bi</p>
<p>From the perspective of editing techniques, this film has eliminated a lot of verbosity compared to the previous "Orchid in the Empty Valley," and of course, the performance is much tighter. However, some places are not very clear, such as Lan Sun's return from the battlefield to Ren Zhu's house, which is not shown in detail on the screen. Rou Yun and Ren Zhu walk from the bedroom to the hall in the middle of the night, passing through many doors, and the sound of closing the doors is very loud. Could it be that none of the many servants in the Tao family are aware of it? When Rou Yun commits suicide, and Lan Sun hears the gunshot, wouldn't he open the door to take a look?</p>
<p>The director's techniques are very flexible, and there are many clever tricks, such as tearing off the calendar pages one by one to indicate that the days are passing by. The different performances of the clock indicate the amount of time Ren Zhu spends on makeup. Several close-up shots are very conscious.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>David Copperfield (9)</h3>
<p>— Liu Cun</p>
<p>After David's Dora died, he was utterly disheartened. A year of traveling might enable him to forget his pain and restore his old mood. But in fact, he returned to Canterbury, where the situation had been messed up by Uriah Heep, and Micawber himself was also entangled in it. The formerly optimistic Micawber, according to Mrs. Micawber, was on the verge of madness. His previous amiable temper had also disappeared. Whatever he thought about, he thought about Heep; whatever he said, he said Heep. But finally, as a result of the advice of David and his aunt Betsey, he told everything he knew and decided to eliminate Uriah from their lives.</p>
<p>Once they had decided on their plan, they besieged Uriah one day and launched an attack. The only weapon they held was a statement of Uriah's crimes, written by Micawber himself, which began with: "I have to declare the crimes of the most unprecedented villain in the world, and I can no longer care for myself. Humility, poverty, and disappointment have always been my lot in a life of suffering. Now, even if I am bound by ropes, I must declare that Heep, none other than Heep, is a forger and a fraudster."</p>
<p>The paper also described how Uriah had tricked Wickfield into signing seemingly unimportant things, which were actually important documents. Uriah used this method to withdraw trust funds for his own use and forged Wickfield's name on many other registers. He used every means to subdue Wickfield and Agnes.</p>
<p>Uriah, attacked by the crowd, was initially furious, reversing his usual humble attitude. Later, David forced him to hand over the shareholder's deeds for destruction. Uriah still refused to give in. David also told him to hand over all the embezzled funds, or he would immediately call the local officials. At this point, Uriah had no choice but to yield. He obediently handed over the shareholder's deeds and the embezzled funds, one by one, because he knew that all the evidence of his forgery was in Micawber's hands, and if he alarmed the authorities, he would have no hope of escape.</p>
<p>After Uriah Heep was expelled, Micawber set off for Australia with his family. On the day of their departure, David, David's aunt, Peggotty, and others saw them off at the dock. Micawber was in high spirits, wearing oilcloth clothes for the voyage and a telescope hanging from his chest. Mrs. Micawber and her children were all dressed like pioneers of a new world. Micawber stood at the bow of the ship, bidding farewell to the people who were seeing them off, saying: "We have abandoned the luxury of our homeland to open up a new world, and we are ready to become new citizens of Cai Tian Xi Di!" He turned to David and thanked him for all his help. Soon the ship set sail. Old fisherman Dan Peggotty, Mrs. Gummidge, and Miss Murdstone were also traveling with the Micawber family. Although it wasn't as happy as before, they were still reunited.</p>
<p>A few days later, David and Agnes were walking on the hillside by the coast, on their way to visit Aunt Betsey. David suddenly said to Agnes: "Now, in this utter silence, and in the face of this beautiful, picturesque sunset, I want to say a few words to you with all sincerity. I want to tell you—when I left you, I loved you, and when I was away from you, I also loved you, and now that I have returned, I still love you." Agnes said softly: "David, do you remember the night that Dora passed away, when the two of us were together? The last thing she asked of me was to take a place in your heart for her. I have loved you dearly all my life." The two of them stopped, and in that moment, everything was forgotten—all the characters that decorated David's life, all the poverty and pain, and even the people he had loved, had all disappeared, leaving only himself and Agnes, standing face to face on the cliffs of Dover, the waves crashing against the shore at their feet. (The End)</p>
