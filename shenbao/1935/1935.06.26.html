<h3 id="c51">實施義敎與經費問題 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 冉</p>
<p>在今日言實施義務敎育。應以解抉經費問題爲第一義。溯自淸季興學。卽提倡義務敎育。以謀敎育之普及。數十年來。政府旣定爲政綱。列入約法。民問亦立會期成。劃區試騐。顧歷時匪淺。致力匪輕。而迄今收效甚微。猶待各方籌劃如何切實推行者。其癥結蓋在經費問題之不易解决耳。最近政府當局决以最大之努力實施義務敎育。吾人切望其迅獲實效。對此不易解抉之經費問題。首有加以考慮之必要。</p>
<p>據敎育部最近公布之統計。全國三十一省市區學齡兒童數計四九·〇二二·二〇二人。現受義務敎育兒童數計一〇·八三四·八四四人。是則實施義敎云者。切實言。之卽爲此三八·一八七·三五八個未受義務敎育兒童設學施敎之謂也依十八年統計。每一初級小學兒童每年公家應擔負經費爲六元三角五分。假令失學之二千八百餘萬兒童同時入學。卽應加籌敎育經費二萬四千餘萬元。其添建校舍·增置敎具·培養師資之所需尙不在內。在此農村經濟非常衰沈。各項雜損厲行裁减。地方敎育經費萬分困難之際。實施義務敎育之經費問題。豈非大可焦慮乎。</p>
<p>雖然。義務敎育之實施。不必於旦夕之問求其完成。苟有决心。何妨取漸進之道。如此則經費之籌措。就中央及各地方之現有經濟能力悉心調度。切實整理。或非全無辦法吾人將此經費問題特別提出。非謂實施義敎在今日尙難談到。蓋欲喚起社會對於籌措義敎經費之注意。由此以敎勵一般人恊助政府督促政府實現義敎計劃之眞實動力耳。</p>
<p>平心而論。中央此次所定義敎辦法。由舉辦一年制短期小學入手。漸進至四年制義務敎育之推行與發展。已頗能注意於减少籌措經費之困難矣。關於籌措經費之辦法。又規定以地方自籌中央補助爲原則。實施之初。令各省市自籌所需經費半數以上。不足之數由中央補助。推行前途當可更得不少之便利。中央與地方果能循此計劃。切實履行。各地人民又能從旁協助。從旁督促。或不致再如前此計劃之徒成畫餅歟。</p>
<p>所可盧者。自實施義敎辦法大綱分布以來。中央方面。據本月六日敎部致四庚欵會董事電以觀。義敎經費尙未有大宗的欵可資支配。各省市方面。據敎部所接覆電以觀。大都希望中央多量協助。而自籌之欵有確實來源者尙不多見。人民方面則又非常沈寂。似取靜觀態度。對於經費之籌集更無所表示。此皆此次義敎運動前途不容樂觀之現象也。</p>
<p>吾人於此。深望全國上下體念此次義敎運動與國家民族前途之關係。確認此次中央所定義敎實施辦法爲切實可行之計劃。對於上列不容樂觀各點加以密切之注意。共起以有效之方法消除之。</p>

<p>（倫敦）本日下院開會時、工黨反對派議員紛紛提出關於英、德海軍協定之質問、多數反對派議員、均反對政府之外交行動、殊出一般人之意料、反對派議員認為二月三日倫敦宣言書及斯德萊柴會議曾决定原則、不訂立雙方協定、並力謀集體行動、今英國政府此項政策、實已將此種原則加以敝棄云、因此一般人相信下院或將於下星期辨論政府外交政策、（二十四日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>— （倪尙龍）</p>
<p>我凡是聽到，寫到，看到春秋，心裏終楚要感到無限的悲傷。因為燕子去了，有再來的時候；花謝了，有再開的時候；草木凋了，有再盛的時候；但是我們虛度過的春秋，一去楚永遠地不再來了！</p>
<p>在冬天的手，最是怕冷了。假如把手再浸到冷水裏，當然格外地戚到冷而痛，但是一離開冷水，不久就會覺得熱烘烘地。這正是「吃得苦中苦方為人上人」的一個絕妙的教訓。</p>
<p>一個生長於奢侈中的靑年，或是生長於依賴他人而母須要自己的勞力爭飯吃的靑年，或是自小嬌養慣的靑年，却難得有大本領的。他與貧苦的孩子相比，正像溫室中培養出來的花，和一顆每一枝幹的長大，都要飽受暴風雨吹打的棕樹相比一樣。</p>

<p>花是人人愛的東西，誰總願意欣賞它，修養身心，陶冶性情，都有它的分兒；雖然山明水秀的風景區，終究需它點綴其間；窈窕淑女，固視花若命，便是粗蠢的村姑，也喜歡摘一朶野花，挿在蔴亂的鬢邊；彭澤令東籬賞菊，成了千古韵事；前人寫西湖三月光景，有「花光如頰，波紋如鏡」句，不楚山水甲天下的杭州，花也佔了重要的成分麼？如今社會習尙，告奠死鬼喪儀，要獻花圈，頌祝生人喜慶，要餽花籃，其實這些技巧，純為人工的修飾，精緻的操作，並非出自藝術家的織手，而為形式魯笨的花司務應運的匠心；都會的公園，私人的別墅，具有園林之勝的教育學府，都有花匠的足跡：他們衣著樸素、胸懷恬淡，絲毫不見躁氣，幽靜如處女，心細如毛髮，不類普通傭工；故他自朝到暮，由春徂冬，在和平氛圍中度着移花接木的生活；他們十居八九，是杭縣金華兩地籍貫，好像有帮口一般，可以和揚州理髮師，崇明包車夫，互相輝映的；工資大的月入三四十元，普通的也要十元左右，甲尋到工資厚一些的主顧，這隻舊飯碗，便轉移另一個同道；說得好聽些，是推引後進，敦睦鄉誼，其實倒是「門羅主義實行者；他們不羨繁華，却生活在富貴之家，任憑社會經濟崩潰到什麽田地，這些具有園林的主人翁，絕不會折扣到他們的薪工，影響到他們勞苦的代價；春秋佳日，紅的花兒、鮮艷欲流，綠的葉兒，新翠欲滴，黃的蕊兒，歷歷如繪，淺的草兒，靑靑如茵，這些景色，獲到衆人的贊美，就楚他們的安慰；花匠，花匠，眞配肇錫　名曰「護花使者」咧。</p>

<p>— 寒玉</p>
<p>西藏路白克路的轉角，是幾個大學校車的車站，許多大學生，都停留在那邊。因此有許多報販去做生意，最引人注目的，就是「老槍」。</p>
<p>他的面龐瘦削得厲害，這顯然是有特別嗜好的特徵，所以大家呌他「老槍」。好久以後，他也自名「老槍」了。</p>
<p>「老槍」的賣報有特別的技能。當人家剛來等車，他就奏近來說：「先生！××的車子只有幾分鐘就到了。站著沒事，買張夜報看看罷！」人家受了他的指示，只好買一張。他的報價比普通都貴一個銅元，他知道大學生是不會計較這些的。</p>
<p>「老槍」不但能連絡學生，還能連絡校車上的人員。在打倒車的時候，他替他們注意；時間的早晚，他又會告訴他們。因此，他能到車上去買報。坐在車上的人，每天總能聽到這樣的話：「先生還去的時候，不要忘掉××夜報啊！」</p>
<p>一種生意勝利後，就有人來競爭。「老槍」的賣報，也不能例外。賣報的突然多起來，他們的報價又便宜，這對於他誠然楚一個很大的打撃。他抵抗的方法，就是放棄「大晚夜報，新夜報」的喊，而用特別的口才，去敷衍學生。這樣，他把這些競爭者都打倒了。</p>
<p>但「老槍」生意不好的時候，也不是沒有。在放暑假寒假的時候，許多學生都脫離學校，校車的生意格外的清淡，他的生意也是一樣，所以每將放假的時候，他總是說：「學校放假，先生們能够回去，可是老槍却倒霉了」現在暑假又要來了，「老槍」倒霉的日子，也就近了</p>

<p>— 方正</p>
<p>這裏是找不出時髦人物，有的是純樸的農村，忠實的農夫；强健的體魄，粗暴的手脚，是他們唯一的生產工具。什麼摩登？什麼愛國？他們始終是不了解的：但是他們對於泥塑木雕的神像，却十分崇信，因此整個的農村，便陷入迷信的漩渦。</p>
<p>他們每日工餘的悄遣塲所，楚一片小小的自由茶肆，所謂自由茶肆，並不是眞正的茶肆，而楚一片小肉店門口，那裏攏着幾只凳子和二張已經修改過的破桌子，便成為自由茶肆了：茶壺楚各人自備的，這樣就可以開始談話了。談話的資料是什麼？說來眞是不堪入耳，不是什麼光緒皇帝……那一類的陳話，便是些神怪，武俠。</p>
<p>偶然也有幾個從都市裏回到鄉村的人，總楚很熱心地勸告他們不要再去說那些陳舊腐敗的鬼話，現在已經不是那種時代了，他們便會撇起嘴來回答「你這人倒希奇！不怕封神榜上的×××嗎？」所以他們的腦裏，永遠灌不進新知識的。</p>
<p>現在上海市，是在提倡識字運動了，一般無力求學而不識字的人，都有受到教育的呵能了！這當然是件美事。但是那些無智識的農夫呢！我很希望當局多多注意到！最好在農村設一小小的民衆教育館，使他們工餘之暇，也可以到教育館裏去看看書：非但受得無限的新智識，而且還可以革去那些無謂的迷信了。或楚派調查員下鄉，去實地調查一下，能有多少不識字的，那末冉派教員去指導他們。那眞受益非淺哩！</p>

<p>因為昨天晚上，太后游湖游得太辛苦了，再加受了一些寒，身子便感覺不快起來，並帶些咳嗽、當伊老人家在不舒服的時候，伊的脾氣總是非常暴躁的：——所以每逢太后病了之後，我們便十分的擔心了，時刻的不敢忘記我們已在伊的手掌之下生存着，呼吸着了；只要伊偶一動念，就可隨時停止我們的生存，閉塞我們的呼吸。說實話，我想我們所有的全部的人，不論男女，在這種時候，都不免要將伊當做是一個很容易危害我們生命的吃人的老妖怪：至少限度，我和其餘的那些女官，以及常在伊近旁隨待着的太監，還有光緒，隆裕，和其餘許多跟伊老人家接近較密的人，都楚這樣的想着！然而無論如何，我自己總可以自信是一個最能對付伊的人。因為根本上，伊原是非常優待着我的，或者楚為了我曾經受過比較高深的學問的關係，伊因此也破格相看，往往給予我種種為他人所絕對不能得到的特殊權益：伊並且還很歡喜聽我向伊講。（三四九）</p>

<p>— 倦龍</p>
<p>滿會是麻子，嘴唇比別人來得厚。笑起來時，一雙三角形的眼睛就變成了二條細細的縫，在村上他可算是一個有名的人物了。他的有名就是因爲他有麻子，有厚嘴唇，有三角眼。出起事來，他一個人就可打倒幾個人。他文生成一副鑽營的本領，祇要妻子告訴他米缸已見了底，他就馬上會到不知甚麼地方去借了兩元錢來羅米；但這錢還的日人是很渺茫的。債主也不敢向他討，不然，他只要翻起厚嘴唇，突出三角眼「老子長，老子短」的吹了一陣子牛，就算應付這次討債的關頸了。近房近鄰給他明佔暗騙的錢財更不能細算了，即一村子的人也十九和他有債務關係的的……所以人家，除了背地稱他「老刁麻皮」外又替他起了一個渾號：「生鐵蛀　」。</p>
<p>人家整年要靠二條泥腿過活，而他祇要像生鐵蛀蟲似的東鑽鑽西鑽鑽就可過活了。甚至在生鐵裏也可找食吃。一年三百六十五天沒見他有幾天赤着脚下過田，而生活却可比別人寬裕；一日三餐，魚肉是不斷的；還燒了幾缸酒，每餐壺，喝飽了就　到街坊上去吹吹牛，全村子的人旣怕他兇悍，面子上就不得不抬了他城隍，於是，他也會翻起厚嘴唇，樂得把，雙三角眼笑成了二條細細的縫。</p>
<p>街坊上的南貨舖啼　終　欠上一筆可看的賑，年關一到，人家急得走頭　路，他却會老着麻臉，把二角眼也同樣地笑成了一條細細的縫，跑到闆那裏去：</p>
<p>「老松哥，這幾天你太忙了！我給你去收賬巴！」</p>
<p>「啊吓！不收！不敢！你也忙哪！」老關知道他又是那，套老把戲，只有在心裏暗了叫苦；『他又想賒賬了！』</p>
<p>年關內楚賭錢最起勁的）個時期。雖然收賬先生呀，債主呀，整大價在家裏逼着　子要錢，但他還半避債半賭錢的整天消磨在賭窟裏。錢輸得精光回家時，就拿妻子或女兒來駡一頓打一頓出了氣。</p>
<p>大概他一生太會作惡，現在年紀已上四十了，還是沒有兒子。村上的人沒一個不在背後暗了地馬着「天有眼，這種人就一世不會有兒子，有好收塲！」而「生鐵蛀蟲一他自己却說是命運不濟，初一下五，就拚命吃素。有什麼大齊期，或觀音如來誕辰，夫妻倆也很虔誠地跟着一般唸佛婆到庵堂廟宇云燒了香坐了夜。甚至會著起草鞋帶了些飯長途跋涉到五六十里外的大佛寺去趕種　的會期。……可是，觀音菩薩還是不肯送個兒子給他！</p>
<p>為了近房遺產的承總或分家事，他也曾好幾次用他「生鐵蛀蟲」的功夫去鑽　過：一哥和四弟死，二份遺產就被他獨吞了。二弟死，幸虧還有一個兒子，他雖然沒法去奪得這份產業，但也被他賠佔了不少。隔壁阿鑲的嫂嫂死（丈夫早亡），這份產業照例是給阿鑲　長子承繼；可是因爲伊生前和一生鐵蛀蟲一發生了曖昧，「生鐵蛀蟲」就趁早把這份產業也弄得七零八落。等伊一死，阿鑲的長子承繼之後，竟發覺道份產業只勝了十分之四了！阿鑲鑲的心裏雖完全明白，可是也只得敢怒而不敢言罷了！</p>
<p>城隍廟要修了，他又用他的鑽營功夫挖得了一個當事人的名義，表面上說為公衆盡一些義務，暗地裏却拚命在填腰包！等廟修好了，他就洋洋得竟地在街坊上把厚嘴唇翻了說：</p>
<p>「做了一世人，現在終算爲城隍菩薩盡了一些孝敬之道了！」</p>

<h3 id="c219">吳趼人的小說論 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>我佛山人吳趼人，和南亭亭長李伯元一樣，沒有系統的關於小說的理論發表。現在能以找釗的，祇是些零星的短章，散見在當時的各雜誌上。一定要依據他論小說的意見，來談他對於小說的理解，祗有這一些材料。</p>
<p>最主要的一篇，是「月月小說序」，他正面的提出了自己對於小說的意見。除掉同意於梁啓超的「小說與繁治之關係一，認識小說的重要性外，又補充了二義，一是「足以補助記憶力，」二是一易輸入智識」。他的理由是，一深奧難解之文」，對讀者是「不如粗淺趣味之易入」，用小說方法輸入智識，讀者會「理史易於記憶」。歸結起來，是小說最易於傳播得普遍，最足以感動人。他主張「借小說之趣味之感情，為德育之一助」</p>
<p>這見解，在今日看來，實在是太平常，但在吾人開始理解得小說重要性的當時，正一怪誕支離」的作品不斷產生，此說實足以糾正許多壞的傾向，而强調讀者對於小說與羣治的理解。</p>
<p>他特殊的注意歷史小說。寫過「兩晋演義」，寫過「痛史」（南宋演義，）可惜都沒有完稿。據他的意見，說典冊很難於使人注意，因端緒複雜，文字深邃，卷帙浩繁。要使這些高文典冊的內容，普遍深入於羣衆，祗有用演義的體裁。蓋祗有小說家言，興味濃厚，可以引人入勝，可以補敎科之不及，可以使「小說附正史以馳，正史薪小說爲導一（歷史小說總序。）</p>
<p>他對於舊的歷史小說，頗多不滿意處。他說，有許多以附會爲能，反使歷史眞相，隱而不彰，且多種種怪謬之事，遂使「愚人益愚」。他暢論這一類的小說道：</p>
<p>「吾嘗默計之，自春秋列國，以迄英烈傳，一鐵冠圖，、除列國外，其附會者當居百分之九九。甚至借一古人之姓名，以爲一書之主腦，除此主腦姓名之外，無一非附會者。如征東傳之寫薛仁貴，萬花樓之寫狄靑是也。至如封神榜之以神怪之談，而借歷史爲依附者，更無論矣。東西漢又失於簡略，殊乏意味，而復不能免蹈虛附會之談。東西晉不成片段，不合體裁，文人學子見之，則曰有正史在，吾何必閱此；略識之無者見之，則曰，吾不解此也，是有小說如無小說也。」(兩晋演義序）</p>
<p>他認爲這些都不是歷史小說的正軌，應該是不避史實，所以他要以最大的力量，從事於這一方面作品的創迭。從這　解出發，他也注意於鼓詞，彈詞，曾經重刊賈鳬西鼓詞，並爲之作序，又在一新小說上，正式的論到彈詞小說</p>
<p>「彈詞曲本之類，粵人謂之木魚書。此等木魚書，雖皆附會無稽之作，要其大旨，無一非陳說忠孝節義者，甚至演一妓女故事，亦必言其殉情人以死。其他如義僕代主受戮，孝女賣身代父贖罪等事，開卷皆是，無處蔑有，而又必得一極良之結局。婦人女子，習看此等書，遂晤受其敎育，風俗亦因之以良也。惜乎此等木魚書，豐於方言，不能遠播耳。」</p>
<p>甚至於把粵風之不淫，歸功於彈詞小說。吳趼人本是舊道德的擁護者，如此方法自不足怪，然其能看重這些不爲人齒的被通人目爲的「下流書一，却有不可及處。此等見解，與李伯元實有相同處。</p>
<p>當時的一些小說評，頗多不能客觀的，如說水滸是社會主義書，蒲松齡爲一排外家，專講民族主義，聊齋派均指滿人之類，吳踐人大不以爲然。他幾次的提出抗議。如他論水滸曰：</p>
<p>「如水滸傳，誌盜之害也，而今人每每稱其提倡平等主義，吾恐施耐庵當日，斷斷不能作此理想。不過彼叙此一百八人，聚義梁山泊，恰似一平等社會之現狀耳。吾曾反覆讀之，意其爲憤世之作。吾國素無言論自由之說，文字每易賈禍，故憂時憤世之心，不得不託之小說，且託之小說，亦不敢明寫其事也，必委曲譬喻以為寓言，此古人著書之苦况也。水滸傳者，一部貪官汚吏傳之別裁也。」</p>
<p>這是比較客觀的，不像他人之硬拉之以入現代思想之領域，故他有一吾雖雅不欲援古人之理想，以闌入今日之理想」的話。他論過鏡花緣，認爲是「爲山海經加一注疏」，謂之理想小說，科學小說。論過金瓶梅肉蒲團，說是懲淫之作，顧都無論水滸之闢透切當。</p>
<p>吳趼人對於小說之社會的認識，以及其批判的態度，從這些話裏，己很可以看得淸楚。他以着進步的封建觀點，了解小說的重要，希望藉之以移風易俗，改革社會。現在所能找到的關於他的論小說材料，如此而已。</p>

<p>徐盈</p>
<p>背着那車輪大的落日，我忙忙地騎着自行車趕路，當太陽消失了最後的一綫，晴空裏飄映着幾塊晚霞時，我到了仲禹的家，進了門，轉過那排向日葵的籬芭，看到那一家人正在簷前吃着飯，我進去，擾動了這個集團。</p>
<p>「我們以爲你進城趕不回——仲禹站起來身，有點歉意的說，他的太太便忙着要給我打水洗臉。</p>
<p>「哈哈，一我笑，一才搬出三天就當客人看待嗎？」</p>
<p>這時，飯桌上首坐的一個蒼老皮膚漢子，頭上受了傷，包着翎帶，忙挿嘴，是用沙沙地喉嚨和仲禹家鄉的土音說道：</p>
<p>怪我——怪我，找對不起——</p>
<p>這是仲禹的哥哥伯先，三天前逃難到此，他便暫住在我的房間裏，我另搬到關帝廟裏打地舖，但我每天的飯還是一起吃，他們一家人，彷彿爲這事進有點過意不去似的。</p>
<p>「客氣客氣」，我說着，隨手從口袋裏掏出一份報紙給他，「老哥的事過，上了今天到的報」—</p>
<p>怎麼說的？」仲禹夫人忙銳聲問道。</p>
<p>伯先用一隻乾枯的黑手接過去，那手上也捲着幾塊膠布。他僅向那標題一農民暴動——推廣員被毆一瞥一眼，鼻翅兒掀一下，什麽話也沒有說便遞給仲禹。</p>
<p>一在一般人，對於排廣員的痛苦是不瞭解的……我接續着說。</p>
<p>仲禹夫婦擠在一起念着那新聞，斷續的發出聲音，一怎麽，推廣員强迫」「民衆强悍」一哥，——你的辦公處燒了？」，「啊，入獄者三十餘人，」「不善運用，激——激成民變……」</p>
<p>那位憔悴的漢子却一聲不響地把桌上一盞酒拿起來一飲而盡。黑臉瞠上泛出薄薄的紫紅。我這時感到我不應當把局墊弄得這樣僵，便拿起酒壺又代他滿了一盅，自己也倒了一盞，說聲，「老哥，請。」兩手將酒盞對舉，來了個乾杯。</p>
<p>仲禹也拋下報紙來加入說笑，我報吿了城裏的幾件消息，挿入幾嘴滑稽，空氣便又恢復了，一直到看見天上星子。</p>
<p>大上掛着星子，飯桌換了茶桌，那桌心裏是）盞煤油燈引得綠的浮壟，灰的夜蛾，黑大油光的金龜子聚集在起飛輕。仲禹提議吹滅了燈，黑影中我們吃着茶，伯先的乎指彈茶碗，可噹作豐，成羣結隊的蚊虫在和唱新曲，我們乎中都拿着芭蕉扇子打「拍子一，寂靜了一刻，還是仲禹說了話。</p>
<p>「哥，李先生也在這裏，你說說這次推廣是怎麼羿的？」</p>
<p>「說也沒意思，一暗黑中那沙沙喉嚨沉重地回答，「我，决不駡老百姓，自然，我更不駡自已，找說句良心話，不爲吃飯，誰幹這東西？」</p>
<p>我們安靜的聽着，紡織娘在草裏嗞嗞。</p>
<p>「這事情——就叫暴動吧，我經過兩次了。那年在××，是推廣棉花，那是自萬棉，柿起來並不比老百姓的土棉花高明，而且是棉桃最愛爛，棉花都變成黃的，第一年勉强種，第一年便暴了動：，這一次，又是蠶種，蠶種是好，是好的，可是比普通老百姓的蠶種上山遲一個星期，這一星期的桑葉是吃得最嚇人的，那一年，找眼看着桑葉成了金子，養不起的，堆堆的蠶寶寶都送到毛坑裏，我的心裏又何嘗不替他們心痛？…」</p>
<p>天空裏流着螢火虫，他輕輕地咳嗽。</p>
<p>「今年，上面又發下來這種蠶種，我爲了吃飯，還是得推，我這次挨打是應該的，老白姓一點沒有罪。他們不是給人研究的，他們要完糧，納稅，一家子老小，吃穿都要從這裏出的。他們沒有罪，……」</p>
<p>我們互相長嘆息，爲不使訂朋友痛苦，然後便改了別的題目。</p>

<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>經理拿出兩枝雪茄，遞給羅菲一枝，羅菲謝絕了：</p>
<p>「經理先生，我不會抽烟」。</p>
<p>「眞話」？　「眞的」。</p>
<p>「啊，這好極了」。</p>
<p>經理先生抽着雪茄，眼睛一會望着烟圈出神，一會又望羅菲的臉面。過一會，彈一彈烟灰，開口道：</p>
<p>「我看你很好，好，就用你罷，明天九點鐘到這里來，辦定手續就正式開始工作。羅小姐，你可不要忘記了這是我的好意，二十多個應徵的人單只留下你」。</p>
<p>羅菲謝過經理的好意，走了。</p>
<p>走××公司大門，羅菲才發覺到自己出了一身汗，好在那兩只流星般的眼睛已經不在她身上轉旋了，遷感到通體鬆快不少。她想起陸文等她很久一定着急，趕忙往江邊碼頭上跑，一邊想：怎麼跟他說呢？說出經理的輕薄麼？陸文聽到一定不高興。吿訴他事情找妥了？自然該吿訴他，他一定很歡喜……。</p>
<p>到碼頭上，東望西望望不到陸文，人很多，偏是不見他的踪影。急了，想喊，又有些不好意思，而且她也沒有那麽大的喉嚨，好一會沒有見到他，眞有如失去了自己的一顆心。她急得埋怨起陸文了，怨他太不體諒她，他該先來迎她才對，像一個勝利榮歸的將軍受到他的愛人歡迎似的。</p>
<p>陸文從旁面走來了。羅菲一把抓住他，急忽忽問：</p>
<p>「你到那裏去了，文，累我尋了好久」？</p>
<p>「遇見一個朋友，陪他走一段路，怎麽樣，事情？不行吧？」</p>
<p>「正相反」！</p>
<p>「就是說？錄——錄取了」？</p>
<p>「一點不錯」。</p>
<p>羅菲看出陸文的樣子不對，趕忙又問道：</p>
<p>「文你怎麽不樂？你想什麽事」？</p>
<p>「沒有想什麽事」。</p>
<p>「你說假話。」</p>
<p>「眞沒有什麼，不過覺得公司裏招請女職員多半是別有居心的罷了。」</p>
<p>「全看人爲，」羅菲笑了，替陸文解悶，「這話對麽？」</p>
<p>「但願能這樣。」</p>
<p>「你還不該爲我賀喜麽？」羅菲扯走話頭。「你該歡喜呀。」</p>
<p>陸文果然笑了，不但只是笑，他還跳了跳脚。</p>
<p>「我自然該爲你賀喜的，等一會我替你買件謝體。」</p>
<p>兩個人沿着馬路左邊又在人行路上走起來，他們往家裏走，人雖有此累，此時却平添了很多的氣力，他們的樣子很傲然，天也似乎故意顯得明亮來光照着他們的前路。</p>
<p>「我還忘記問你了，你從什麽時候正式開始作事？」陸文忽然想起來事情。「什麽時候開始？」</p>
<p>「明大九點。」</p>
<p>「明天你就是憫有職業的人了。」</p>
<p>「明大我們的生活就有點着落了。」</p>
<p>可是陸文又想到別有居心的事情上。爲什麽他偏要想起這一套？他難過。他認爲妻子的求業絕對不是技藝成功的，實在是和妓女黃色相差不多。然而把妻子關在家裏作良妻賢母又不是他的主張，他一向是贊成女子跟男子同樣要爲社會服務，女子跟男子同樣要作些事情的。</p>
<p>沒有職業時，怕尋不到職業，有了職業，又想到別的枝節問題上，多麽矛盾啊。</p>
<p>羅菲也正在回想經理家中過去的一刻，一想起來，她就有些爲後日的自己躭心。經理的輕薄如果繼續下去，她可怎樣對付？她這個職業的存留，也繫在他的手中，只要他一時不高興，她就可以作犧牲品。看來她不能違背著他的意思作事，但這樣一來，以後的問題就多了。想來想去想不出穩妥的辦法，最後的决定還是像他回答陸文的詁去作：事在人爲。她還加上一番解說：合則留，不合則去。</p>
<p>陸文走着走着買了兩包花生米，自己留下一包，另外一包遞給他的妻子，笑着說：</p>
<p>「菲，這就是我慶賀你的禮物。」</p>
<p>「太薄了。好，禮薄義重。」</p>
<p>羅菲也笑天了。</p>
<p>海關大鐘正指十二點，公司銀行的小職員們有乘公共汽車的，有乘電車的回到家裏去用餐，還有到就近的飯館去飽腹。每部車子都擠得很厲害，「後頭一部，一賣票人大聲喊呌着。</p>
<p>陸文跟羅菲也有些餓了，要快些趕回家好燒飯，走了一會，陸文領着妻子跳上一部公共汽車，落了座，他低聲說：</p>
<p>「反正職業也應徵妥了，我們也來凑一回然鬧罷。」</p>

<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>磨坊池上</p>
<p>新年過去了。好久以來，我便熱戀着我那雙乎滑鋼底的荷蘭式溜冰鞋，我多少也有點藐視我的同學們，因爲他們祗有舊時留下的那種粗礪的鐵底鞋啊。但現在才到了嚴寒的時候。</p>
<p>這是一僩星期日下午。離城不遠的磨坊池，個不大不小的湖泊，上面結了一層閃閃有光的冰鏡。半城居民都聚集在那裏，在新鮮的冬天空氣中了。老人和少年，有些穿一雙溜冰鞋，有些穿隻溜冰鞋，有些甚至鞋底縛着一根乳牛骨頭，都在那裏練習這高尚的溜冰　。—湖岸近旁架起一些帳幕；附近，在陸地上，熊熊的爐火燒着蒸氣上騰的大鍋，各種使人溫暖的飲料都是從鍋裏供給的。這裏或　裏，人們可以看見一個手推的雪橇從人羣中向空闊的冰面上衝去，橇中生着一個滿身嚴厲的女孩子姿態，但是大家都還在湖泊近岸走動，湖心似乎還不是十分安全的。</p>
<p>我把我的鋼鞋縛在脚下，一個人沿着湖岸溜了一趟。—當我轉回來時，我看見學舞時的件侶差不多都聚集在帳幕旁邊。小姑娘們穿着冬季大衣，乎向前仲着，戰戰兢兢地在那似乎業已物成軌跡的冰面上走動。弗里茨早一天晚上就已把他那雕有鹿頭的黃角雪橇放在磨坊裏了，此時他　把　綠蒂小姐推了回來，已經另有一個跳舞女伴披了華美的虎皮坐到雪橇　去。這位騎士遲　了下，拿眼睛向周圍觀看，彷彿要找尋一個帮手幫他同做這件不甚輕鬆的服事娘兒們工作似的，但我在此時恰好把臉轉開去，因與前面在羣工匠人家底婦人和姑娘中間，我看見了雷娜麗·波力嘉；自從最後晚跳舞之後找就沒有碰見了。那些女孩子們輪流着呌一個舉徒—他是做我家生意的細木工匠底學徒—她們推一個輕義的雪橇，我立刻認出這雪樣是我以前的朋友克里斯多士所有的。升也看見他的妹妹，但他自已幷不在那兒。冰鏡底光輝大概把他吸引到湖泊中央去了，因爲在全城男孩子當中他是最好的溜冰家之一。</p>

<p>— 家爲</p>
<p>六月二十日各報載電通社東京電：「關于十七日駐美英國大使林德賽訪問美國國務院一事，據華盛頓電報，謂英美兩國欲結成共同戰綫，援用九國公約，牽制日本之對華行動，英美日內將採具體的行動，日本外交當局對此持冷靜之態度，認爲不値識者一笑……萬一英美提携，援引九國條約，向日本抗議，亦决以下列見地排斥之，（一）河北問題已由中日兩國當事者解决，非他國所能過問；（二）英美兩國每欲援引之九國公約，斷不能承認英美兩國於河北之該條約爲後盾，向日本發言：（三）該條約之效力，日本認爲滿洲事變後，事實上業已消滅。」</p>
<p>從一九二二年到現在，已經有十幾年的歷史了，我們這堂堂的「九國公約」；然而，「事實上業已消滅」了。這在當事者聽了，眞得要抽口冷氣的吧？</p>
<p>不過，事情也並不偶然的。就以「國際聯盟」來講吧，在「事實上」是個什麽呢？這也是爲「識者」所共知的啦！而且，今日這個時代，這個世界，本來似乎太偉大了。一切關係的複雜與變更，眞要使人不可捉摸。而「現實」正是狂瀾般地在汹湧，在澎，，一刻沒有停留。</p>
<p>看吧；掛着「一言堂」的金字招牌的鋪子，却天天揭起了「大减價」，「大放盤」花花綠綠的旗幟展招着高空。說明是「收付兩抵有餘」，然却終于宣吿「淸理」，「停業」。天災要鬧荒，豐收了同樣過不了日子。身有了一藝之長，然並不有得一席之地……更有像：一面有人在高唱什麽「和平合作」，「呼籲和平」，一方面大家正在實施强迫軍役，重整軍備，添造新艦，擴張空軍……一面唱着「民族復興」，「和平建設」……一切是這樣地在矛盾，在對立，在衝突，在鬭爭——這是今日的社會，也是今日的世界！</p>
<p>好吧，「九國公約」，「事實上已消滅」了。而「事實」將更吿訴我們所有一切的眞面具！</p>

<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>（風物篇之一）</p>
<p>在鬧街上，小小的那麽一間屋子，屋子的中央放了一只褪了漆的方桌子，有人時常在這上面洗衣服，縫被，所以幾年來，這桌子也就凋敝得可憐了。挨着左右二片墻，安置着二排條凳，中間的牆壁上掛了一幅「玄武大帝聖像」，兩邊又雜亂地貼上些「百無禁忌」的紅紙塊，與那些標詰般的紅紙條。「諸親好友，無保不荐」，「走馬上任，一箭（荐）成功」：在門外，一塊紅漆的牌子上寫着黑字：「陳老荐頭傭役介紹所」。</p>
<p>大淸早，開了排門，這「陳老荐頭」是怪墊鬧的，有住在店裏的，也有從外面來「上生意」的，年輕的；年老的：有剛從鄉下出來的「土貨」，也有「老吃人家飯」的「熟手」：有新近在災荒裏死了兒子，走了媳婦，帶着一付六十多歲的老骨頭，拚着死到這大都會裏來給人使喚，找尋一點活命的可能性的老婆子；而另一方面，也有拋棄了剛滿月的孩子，趁這麽一個好機會，千方百計地托人帶到上海來，打算把自己的孩底營養——這一些豐滿的奶水，來喂人家「公館」裏的「小少爺」，換幾個錢回去完租的……這些人，全帶了一種憂急，希望與興奮，期待地排着在這些條凳上坐着，用好奇的眼睛驀生地看外面的世界，外面的人，外面的街道，而在心裏則想念着鄕裏的雖然破陋然而卻是親切的田園，在荒災裏上了吊的親屬，流到別人手裏去了的自己的嬰孩，過往的平靜的日子，謎一般的「生意」的到來，飛快的畫與夜，明天的自己的生活……</p>
<p>（外面的世界多够呌人難以相信呀那大洋房，那汽車，那穿着「外國衣裳」的先生與太太們，那太得怕人的飯館與戲院子……這世界可眞木錯啊！但是，爲什麼我們却得過着不斷的荒災的日子，把自己的寶寶遞到別人手裏去呢？）</p>
<p>這是個謎，都呌人難以想像的謎啊：「也許——不，眞的！也許運氣好，「上」到了一家好公館裏，巴巴結結地做發年，還撈得到幾個棺材本錢吧？鄉下西橋頭的根生娘一家，不是婆媳倆在上海「帮」了幾年「人家」，回來還蓋屋，還贖田做墳，過得舒舒服服的嗎？」</p>
<p>可是，想着想着，坐在對面長凳上的那個做「粗做」的老婆子，正像猜透了人底幻想？而又過意要給這幻夢一下子迎面的痛擊似地，針對着一些人的美麗的空的盤算，呶着嘴說起來了。</p>
<p>——哼，你們當了在上海灘上吃人家飯是容易的嗎？這年頭，「一處荒，處處荒」，出來吃人家飯的多，用人的人家也祇是「揀精揀肥」地挑剔了。我從淸明過後到上海起，也已經二三個月頭了，在荐頭店裏坐着連看也沒有人來看，好容易有一家公館裏要一個老媽子，我求着店裏的送人的，答應了他額外的送人錢，到那裏去試做了三天，上面說：「人是還可以做得，祇是外表生得討人厭，而且年紀也太大一點了。我捫這裏是要年紀輕輕的，走得到人面前去見得人的。」你想想，可氣不氣呀！回來還吃送人的埋怨，說白賠了脚步，早就知道不對的。你想想，我們出賣力氣，可還得連帶出賈年紀，身段，跟險袋兒呢。</p>
<p>人全把心沈了下來，彷彿連門外的「陳老荐頭」那方大招牌，也有一點兒灰陣陣了。</p>
<h3 id="c226">攝影憶舊 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>縣小畢業那年，伯父贈我一具攝影機作爲紀念品。那是構造最簡單的攝影機，和現在市面上的「方鏡箱」大同小異，鏡頭的距離是不能伸縮的，在規定地位捺着快門，就能照到一個很好的像片。這樣引動了攝響的興趣，那個暑期裏，每天帶着攝影機到處亂跑，鄰居的伯伯叔叔，哥哥弟弟，都强迫他門收到我鏡箱裏去。到晚上，又扭纏着伯父要求他冲曬，把父親的書房作爲暗房，鄕下沒有電炬？做了個紅紗風燈，黑暗中工作的時候，蚊虫嗡嗡之聲成羣飛行，幾乎揮手之間，卽能碰着幾個小身體。伯父是特別喜歡我的，雖然忍受不住這種意外的犧牲，不過拍着我的頭頂頻頻說：「被你擾死了！對於冲曬出來的像片，還詳盡加以批判，這自然更增加了我的勇氣。但是當時的成績實在太壞了，六張底片之中，沒有兩張可以隱約認出是伯伯抑叔叔，哥哥或弟弟。自己却是興高采烈，那是一個糢糊的影子，伯父問我時，我一看就吿訴他是鄰家的阿狗叔。「誰的個子比他高呢？」還振振有辭的作爲證據。這種笑話，父親晚餐飲酒的時侯，每次作爲談話資料的。但是我的興趣有增無减，當下學期考入縣中讀書，伯父從上海郵寄了兩册「攝影入門」給我，於是我知道攝影初步應該攝靜物的。我本來感覺到我的攝影對象續漸减少，攝靜物的範圍自然更廣大，後園的枇杷樹，小弟弟的「立桶」，（防止小孩子傾跌的一種木製器具）我都一一攝入鏡頭。一年之後，浪費了無數的底片，但是伯父每次帮我洗片的時候，他發現一張光綫，角度，露光施展了我的攝影本領的，總拍着我的頭讚美我是一個攝影的天才，而且他自始至終指導我，把許多拍壞的底片指示我所以拍壞的原因。有一年春假，可以說要擴大我攝影的範闈，我和伯父到杭州去，對於，那美麗的西子，我們收攝了許多照片，每一張都是由張伯父詳細解釋後而攝取那景物的，那一次的收穫，幾乎沒有一張是不滿意的。</p>
<p>但是過後我就不高興攝影了，這是自然的結果。人類對於一宗新鮮的事物，往往飲食俱廢去研究，稍稍進步之後，早已把興趣移到另一宗新鮮的事物上了。不過那末多的像片，我都一一收藏起來，分別凝在照相簿里，依時間先後排列着。同時向另一方面去收集人家的攝影了。舉凡幾位名家的攝影集，祇要知道的都去買了來。記得某次參觀黑白社的攝影展覽會，有二幀標着二十五元的售價的照片，我呆呆立着不想走開，歸家來想着用什麽方法弄來，卽是出於偷竊也是不惜的樣子，於至可見我的愛好攝影了。雖然從那個伯父贈我的鏡箱分手之後，沒有更進一步去研究牠。</p>
<p>這一次搬家，從一只破箱子裏搜出我悉心珍藏的紀念品，有的幾乎完全褪　了，打開最早一集來看，完全是一片霉汚的紙片了，自己都辨不淸那個是鄰家阿狗叔的高個子了。但是我依舊珍惜地整理了，好好保藏起來，留備着更有一個時間我會特然憶起牠們而溫習我的舊夢，孩童時代的紀念品都是値得珍藏的，牠會給於我甜蜜的回憶及悽然的辛酸。</p>

<p>— 夏蔭</p>
<p>（一）悒鬱</p>
<p>世紀的悒鬱是無法徘遣的呢，流浪人是只有寂寞地連吐着無有章句的太息的。長串的日子就在悒鬱的情味裏蕩過去了。</p>
<p>將向誰傾訴呢，這難言的隱恫！在人海里摸索了二十餘年的生命留下的痕抹只是一連串的寂寞，一連串的畸零，一連串的冷酷：霓虹燈下的艷笑，難道也足以塡飾生命的空罅麽？唉唉，菲律濱人打出的爵士樂原是職業者的顫抖啊</p>
<p>這是怎樣的矛盾，不，我是怎樣的厭倦於這游離的無業者的日子。夏夜的有着朗月與霓虹燈的街頭，輕鬆與明快，是够迷惑人的呢。可是，游行於那兒的一個流浪漢子，究竟是爲着什麽來呀</p>
<p>我不解，一個流浪漢子，伴着他的只是一長串做不完塲的灰色之夢。今夜，我又帶起自家的寂寞，蝸牛一般鈍緩的爬游過這有着朗月與霓虹燈的街：這一切的快的調子、在我眼裏都會幌成一片的迷亂，使我目眩心顫。然而，我不一能離開它，我沒有那樣的勇氣來收拾這沉淪的都市風情的迷醉慾，去開拓郝新鮮健全的足以安頓自家的思想信仰情感的新地。對於現實的幻滅又無法來制止挑醒消，織於生涯中的世紀的悒鬱。於是，我只有寂寞地述吐着無有章句的太息，算作是對於游離生涯的厭倦咒詛。而述串的日了，就在悒鬱的情味里蕩過去了。</p>
<p>這是够痛心的哪？當淸夜靜思反省的時候，我是能够毫不胡塗的給這頹廢的生涯理出一條明晰的路綫來的。這不是類於自暴自棄的撕碎一切，讓連串的灰色之夢去腐蝕生命的血與力麽？這時，除舉手痛撻腦袋，企圖在肉體的痛楚裏博得一些精神上的痛快外，心裏也會喊出。</p>
<p>——爲什麽不能振作一點呢！</p>
<p>然而，日子是像長流的水一般過去了：這反省的喊聲。不也像跌墜在水上的花片，隨着水流飄去得遼遠了麽？檢看一遍現刻的生涯，又是如何變動着呢？唉唉，愧責的代價是這排紅的雙頰呀。</p>
<p>世紀的悒鬱是無法排遣的，長串的日子就在這悒鬱的情味裏蕩過去了。</p>
<p>（二）沉默</p>
<p>自從肩頭掮起了生活的行囊，就像一隻失羣的烏，消失了天眞的歌唱：人生的苦汁，把我侵洗得漸漸變成沉默了。長年的飄流，顚沛於生活的風雨交逼的崎途，從沒有得到過人世的愛護，同情，諒解；冷酷，中傷，譏妬，就像一隻目光兇兇的狼，隨時隨地窺伺在前後左右，不時跳出來給我猛咬一口；忍受着痛楚，任鮮紅的血流在脚下，寂寂無聲的滲在泥層裏。這無窮的磨難，年靑的心，已漸漸退去了雅性的率眞：變成沉默，冷靜，而且用沉默來打發歲月了了</p>
<p>但是人生的旅路沒有走完以前，生活的行囊是放不下來的，人生的苦汁將更來得苦澀濃烈：這無窮的磨難呵！</p>
<h3 id="c228">雨之什 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 眞</p>
<p>做夢也料不到有那末一聲很親切的雷嗚。</p>
<p>可是那霹靂聲雖然淸澈地掠過南海叔的耳朶，同時那間草屋，像一隻沉陲在沙灘上的靑鶴也給震得一抖，而他仍舊不相信，當他入睡時天還是爽朗地沒一片兒雲鱗，不會變得這樣快—</p>
<p>這是他兩種心理在回答：一面慶祝着時雨，一面又懷疑天公仍是那末慳吝</p>
<p>抖地跳下床，又抖地開門來看天，天和他，一喜一怒地成了個對照：天的西南角上，暗黑的雲峯往上爬，漸漸地蓋滿了蔚藍的面部，掩沒了爍燿的星子，似乎一觸，便有無數火花來燬燒這地球：他呢，面上縐紋堆成一只野百合，喜得沒有適當的話來安慰自己，拔步跑到床前面，打了一下他的老婆子：</p>
<p>「起來看啊—有飯吃飽了啊！」</p>
<p>老婆跟着他的手跑出來，破衣在身上一揌一楒地：更喜壞了七八歲的兒子</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>，聽說有飽飯吃，他近一月來全吃菜粥，從沒飽過肚皮，夢裏聽見父親這句話，便滾下了床，一面呌着：</p>
<p>「爸爸，我要吃！」</p>
<p>他以爲半夜裏爸爸弄了米或別的什麽回家來。</p>
<p>一交跌在黑魆魆的屋子裏，罎罐淸脆地發出一聲饗，老婆子趕快摸進來，這樣駡兒子：</p>
<p>「浪根子的，半夜三更吃什麽啊！」</p>
<p>「爸爸不是喊有飽飯吃嗎？」兒子辯着。</p>
<p>「要下雨了，下了雨，收了穀，才有飯吃，吃飽飯，還得睡一覺啦！知道嗎？」把兒子攙起來。</p>
<p>「媽媽！我肚子餓了。」兒子哽出抽泣聲。</p>
<p>「去睡！睡着了便不會覺到餓了。」</p>
<p>「越餓越睡不着呢！」</p>
<p>見子沒去睡，跟着母親走到門外去看天。天，嘖出口水來了，還隱隱地有點風秧子，和一股悶熟。</p>
<p>「不起風；多下點雨，菩薩，再一乾，我們便活不下去了！」南海叔像自說神兒呢喃着，一手搭在見子頭上。</p>
<p>兒子餐着熱和風，雖然沒减少絲毫饑餓，但一想到未來的白米飯，活鯽魚，口裏倘出一滴饞涎。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c238">汽車引擎點火時間之校凖 <a href="#c238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— 陳星</p>
<p>——俗稱「擺湯勃羅」——</p>
<p>一般的汽車引擎。槪爲四行程循環式。卽曲軸兩轉。各汽缸中的活塞。上下各兩次。完成進汽。壓縮。爆炸和排汽四個行程。故引擎的汽缸數目。不問多少。當曲軸旋轉兩週。每一汽缸。都爆炸一次。以產生動力。惟各汽缸的爆炸時間。必須一定。不能過早。亦不能過晚。而其爆炸之先後。卽引擎的發火次序。尤須遵照規定。不能稍亂。如此。方可使引擎的工作。臻於優美。</p>
<p>汽缸中吸入燃料。經壓縮後。由發火系供以電火泡。纔能着火爆炸。因之。此火泡供給之早晚。及在各汽缸中發生之先後。對於每一汽缸爆炸時間與引擎的發大次序。具有直接的關係。故必須嚴格地加以對準。執行此種工作。卽爲校準引擎的點火時間。</p>
<p>進行校準的時侯。須先將第一汽缸（靠近水箱的一只後同）的活塞。置於壓縮行程的極頂點。其不同方法。分述於後。</p>
<p>（一）取去第一汽缸火星塞。以大拇指按住其裝置之洞口。另以搖手柄搖轉曲軸。當指頭感有壓力頂上時。汽缸中已爲壓縮行程。活塞上行。於是將指頭移開。用彎鐵絲從洞口挿入。同時仍極緩搖轉曲軸。測知活塞上至不能再上之處。卽可斷定已至極頂點。</p>
<p>（二）若取去火星塞，可以窺見進出汽門。則汽缸中之是否爲壓縮行程。亦可以目窺知。當曲軸搖轉。看第一汽缸的進汽門（直列式引擎。兩頭兩只。均爲出汽門。當中進汽門與出汽門。兩兩相間）。由張開而又關閉、卽頂上後而又下去）。卽爲壓縮行程開始。活塞到頂與否。可以彎曲鐵絲。依上法測知之。</p>
<p>（三）以手試摸末一汽缸（靠近飛輪壳）的汽門挺。亦可確定第一汽缸的活塞。是否在壓縮行程的極頂點。將曲軸緩緩搖轉。待末一汽缸出汽門。張開後而又將關閉（卽最末一只汽門挺。升至極頂點後而又下降）。再繼續極緩搖轉。並以手轉動汽門挺。若至出汽門的汽門挺。僅能勉强轉動。而進汽門的汽門挺。尚可轉動自如。此時末一汽缸的活塞。已在排汽行程的極頂點。直列式引擎。第一與最末兩只汽缸的活塞。槪在同一平綫上。末一汽缸的活塞。旣爲徘汽到頂。則第一汽缸的活塞。必在壓縮行程之極頂點無疑了。</p>
<p>（四）倘使卸去汽缸蓋。則較爲簡便。可以搖手柄搖轉曲軸。至第一汽缸的進汽門。張開而又緊閉。再繼續搖轉。使活塞至極頂點爲度。</p>
<p>（五）以上諸法。係適用於順置汽門之引擎。若爲倒懸汽門引擎。則可移開汽門搖程蓋。再將曲軸搖轉。視第一汽缸的進汽門。張開後重行關閉。然後以手試知汽門搖桿與汽門桿間之間隙。進出汽門都相彷彿。此時第一汽缸的活塞。可以斷定已在壓縮行程的極頂點。</p>
<p>（六）引擎之製有特殊記號者。則以對準記號。可更準確。例如去年的別克車。汽門係倒懸。飛輪壳之一旁。設有一小孔。上蓋以可移動之小門。孔之兩旁。橫刻二直綫。而飛輪上面。亦橫刻一直綫。上註『ADY』字樣。搖動曲軸。至第三汽缸的出汽門（卽從冰箱向後數第五只汽門）開過以後。再繼續緩搖之。及至飛輪與飛輪壳子的諸直綫。完全吻合時。第一汽缸的活塞。已至壓縮行程的極頂點。</p>
<p>第一汽缸的活塞。其位置旣已確定。卽不得再稍移動。並可將火星塞裝回，接着。可把分電器蓋移去。鬆開分電器壳子或偏心的鎖螺絲。此鎖螺絲。假使爲鎖止壳子的。則露於外。鬆開後。壳子卽可任意轉動。如爲鎖止偏心。則須取去分電刷。將鎖螺絲鬆出。並取去之。再將分電刷置上。方可轉動偏心。於是轉動壳子或分電刷。務使白金上的膠木片。正爲偏心所頂起，白金頭已經完全張開。分電刷上之接觸頭。正指觸於分電器蓋上的一接觸點。此接觸點。原非固定。惟以便於記憶起見。平常的慣例。總把準對分電器蓋邊緣所特設凹口或凸片之接觸點。作爲標準。故欲使分電刷接觸頭。指觸於作爲標準的分電器蓋上之接觸點。當轉動壳子或偏心時。可無須裝上分電器蓋。祗要使分電刷接觸頭。準對於壳子邊緣所特設之凸片或凹口（當分電器蓋裝上時。蓋上之凹口或凸片。與此凸片或四口相吻合）。就可以了。如此對準以後。卽可將鎖螺絲鎖緊。而分電刷與分電器。均須照原來裝上。</p>
<p>白金頭完全張開時。間隙須適當。不能太大。亦不能太小。如有失常。應加重新校準。可先以白金扳頭。鬆開白金頭上的鎖螺絲。再將調節螺絲轉進或旋出少許。以得較大或較小之間隙。於是鎖緊之。普通間隙。約爲千分之十二至千分之二十五英寸。欲知其確數。可以厚薄尺量之。如無厚薄尺。亦可以新聞紙代用。一層新聞紙的厚度。約爲千分之五英寸。</p>
<p>於是。將分電器蓋上準對凹口或凸片的一根皮綫。（此皮係裝於蓋上綫頭護管之內。並與分電刷之接觸頭相通）接聯於第一汽缸的火星寒。其餘的。按偏心旋轉方向。將第二第三各綫。照引擎規定的發火次序。亦依次接聯於各汽缸的火星塞。如四汽缸引擎。發火次序爲一三四二。則第二綫應接聯於第三汽缸。第三綫應接聯於第四汽缸。第四綫應接聯於第三汽缸。六汽缸引擎。亦可依此例推。</p>
<p>發火次序。四汽缸引擎。爲一二四三。與一三四二六汽缸引擎。則爲一五三六二四。及一四二六三五。後者。祇舊式車間有加以採用。惟一般的汽車。都採用前者。此發火次序。最好在拆卸之前。卽能查明記住（不管汽缸多少。知道了分　偏心的旋轉方向。一拉分電器蓋聯於火星塞的皮綫。卽可查出）。否則。可搖轉曲軸。視各汽缸進出汽門張開的先後。或取去所有火星塞。將指頭按件及以紙團塞住其洞口。試各汽缸壓縮的先後。以確定之。</p>
<p>如此校準以後。可發動引擎以試之。在每一汽缸中。發火系所供給的火泡。時間如過早或太晚（俗呼『火快』或『火慢』）卽宜重加校準。過早。車起動時。發生衝撞。太晚。引擎『劈劈劈』作響。車行無力而慢。重加校準時。仍須鬆去各鎖螺絲。將分電器壳或偏心。轉動一點兒。使偏心頂起膠木片。及白金頭張開之時間略早或稍晚。以求得準確的時間。不管轉動壳子或偏心。順旋轉方向爲晚。逆旋轉方向爲早。</p>
<p>當運用時。火泡供給的時間。因引擎旋轉速率的遞增。須隨之提早。蓋如此可使經壓縮後的燃料。能，於活塞到達極頂點時。爆炸完全。水致減弱動力。提早度數。各車微有不同。惟最多約為三十度。例如福特車B式。提早度數。最多為二十九度。V——8　06”（V式八汽缸一百零六時輪基）為二十度。V—8　ｒ2”則為二十六度。舊式車。有於錶板上或駕駛盤中。裝一火花桿。以管理此時間之早晚。當引擎速率增高時。此桿須依提早之方向撥動若干。但近年所出各車。則大多爲自動調制。不必另加注意。如有前項裝置之汽車。則在校準點火時間時。須將火花桿撥置於最晚地位。不得有誤。</p>
<p>引擎的點火時間。如果校準不當。則可使引擎工作失常。動力减低。過耗燃料。額外發熱。和車行衝撞。機件受傷。若遇此種情形。須照上法加以嚴格的糾正。於是對所用的汽車。方不致遭受意外的損失。</p>
<p>附註。柴油車。係由空氣被壓縮後所產之高熱。以使燃料爆炸。故本篇所述。僅適用於汽油車。而不適用於柴油車。</p>

<p>去年美國汽車稅收增高據美國汽車會最近的調查。美國聯邦各省及當地所徵於汽車主的特稅。一千九百三十四年這一年達到最高紀錄。一九三四年摩托稅總數爲美金一，一六〇，五六四，三八〇元。一九三三年的計數爲美金一，一二八，二六二，三三一元。兩相比較。就可以曉得他的高低了，這種稅損的類別。分析如次。省郡和市合計八九八，二二六，七二二元。聯邦二六二，三三七，五五八元。各省的註冊費雖略有减低，可是因爲聯邦和省的汽油及個人財產稅的增加。結果也沒有什麽影響。美國汽車會會長湯姆士享萊稱。根據了這個徵稅的記錄。現在竭力在設法增高稅率的省立法院。就應該視爲一個警吿。此外並希望國會能廢北公路運輸的聯邦特殊稅。</p>
<p>舊汽車廣吿之規定美國底特羅地區凡有出售舊汽車的。現在都要受一種廣吿上的節制。美國商業改善局曾經立了一個道德的標準。又經過可靠的汽車商協助。得各家報紙的合作。凡是誘惑性和不嚴正的廣吿。都在擯棄之列。還有幾種詞句規定不可引用。因之在出售舊汽車的廣吿中。像「十全」。「與新車無別」等句子或字眼一槪禁用。「重新整理」這個詞句也過於含混。譬如在車身上無論何種整理。從旋緊一只螺絲到擦凈發火塞。咸可運用此詞。這種方法使購車者易受曚蔽。因而亦遭禁用。有一個條規必須遵守的。就是無論那種舊車子出售的時候。在廣吿中一定要叙明他製造年月與車身式樣。拿「免費試用」一語來誘惑購車者。也是在所不許。至於付欵的數目和時期。均須一一說明。不得稍涉含混。</p>

<p>(Nanjing) National Government Order of the Fifth Day: (1) Tianjin Mayor Wang Kemin's petition to resign due to concurrently serving as the Acting Chairman of the Executive Yuan's Peiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee and being unable to divide his attention. Wang Kemin is approved to be relieved of his substantive post as Mayor of Tianjin. This order. (2) Shang Zhen is hereby ordered to no longer concurrently serve as Acting Mayor of Tianjin. This order. (3) Cheng Ke is hereby appointed as Mayor of Tianjin. This order. (4) Zhang Houwan, member of the Hebei Provincial Government and concurrently Director of the Civil Affairs Department, is hereby ordered to no longer concurrently serve as Acting Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government. This order. (5) Shang Zhen is hereby appointed as a member of the Hebei Provincial Government. This order. (6) Shang Zhen is hereby appointed concurrently as Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government. This order. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Houwan arrived in Tianjin from Peiping at 7:00 PM on the 25th and is scheduled to visit Shang Zhen early on the 26th to urge him to quickly go to Baoding to assume the chairmanship. Zhang Houwan stated that he was very pleased to learn in Peiping that the Executive Yuan had appointed Commander Shang as the Chairman of Hebei Province, ensuring that someone would be responsible and allowing him to be relieved of his heavy burden. He will visit and urge him to take office tomorrow, and then return to Baoding immediately to prepare for the handover. The provincial government has been fully prepared since moving to Baoding, and official duties are being carried out as usual without any interruption. Currently, banditry in the province has been suppressed, but the only concern is the drought near Baoding, for which the Civil Affairs Department is planning relief measures. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Shang Zhen stated that he has not yet received the order from the central government appointing him as Chairman of Hebei Province. Although he met with Mayor Cheng Zhongyu today, the date of the handover has not been determined. The administrative policy for Hebei Province will be determined after investigating the situation after taking office. He has not heard anything about the provincial government moving back. He has no opinion on this matter and will only follow the orders of the central government. He will continue to concurrently serve as the commander of the Tianjin-Pukou Garrison. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Cheng Ke stated that he was acting in a private capacity to mediate the Zhangbei incident. Negotiations between the two sides have begun in Peiping, but he did not participate in the meeting because he is not a current military or political figure. He has heard that the central government's instructions have not yet arrived, so a final decision cannot be made. Qin Dechun was very straightforward and his resignation was an appropriate gesture. The central government's telegram of reassurance arrived in Peiping, and after encouragement from friends, he has abandoned the idea of resignation and will continue to be responsible for negotiating with the Japanese. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Cheng Ke returned to Tianjin from Peiping at 6:00 PM on the 25th and immediately visited Shang Zhen at the Tianjin-Pukou Garrison Headquarters to discuss the issue of taking office as Mayor of Tianjin. The handover is scheduled for 9:00 AM on the 27th. Cheng Ke stated that he learned about the central government's announcement of his appointment as Mayor of Tianjin from the evening newspaper after boarding the train in Peiping. Tianjin is currently very calm, the tense situation has passed, and people are no longer panicking. There is no harm in delaying the takeover slightly and not rushing. He has lived in Tianjin since the Xinchou year (1901) and has never moved elsewhere, so he is quite familiar with the situation in Tianjin. Shang Zhen is an old friend with whom he has worked before, and he is very fortunate to be cooperating again. Chinese municipal administration is only in its infancy and is far behind foreign countries. Municipal administration is not just about building a few roads. The position of the Mayor of London can influence the world, which shows its importance. He believes that the first priority of governance is to ensure that citizens know the law and have protection. For example, the Chinese concession is not as prosperous as the foreign concession, but shops are willing to move into the foreign concession. This is not because they want to move, but because they have no protection and feel insecure, so they have to move. In the future, he will focus on this point. As for tangible construction, as long as there is money, construction is not difficult. Recently, Tianjin stopped paying the Hebei Provincial Government and the military branch previously allocated funds, saving 140,000 yuan per month, which can be used for construction and will provide some financial leeway.

<p>(Nanjing) There are many rumors in foreign dispatches about Ambassador Chiang's meeting with Hirota. An official of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs said that Chiang's meeting with Hirota was merely a casual exchange of opinions and did not discuss any specific issues. As for Ambassador Chiang's planned return to China at the end of the month, it is not for any special mission, but simply because he has been away from the country for a long time and is preparing to return home to visit the central authorities and his old friends.

This reporter recently inquired with diplomatic circles about the results of Chiang's talks with Hirota and the purpose of his return to China. It is reported that Chiang's meeting with Hirota was only a casual exchange of opinions and did not discuss any specific issues or plans. His return to China is also not for any special mission, but because he has been away from the country for a long time and wants to return for a visit. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>

<p>(Peiping) Regarding the Chahar incident negotiations, the central government's reply arrived in Peiping yesterday, ordering Qin Dechun to consult with all relevant parties locally for handling. We have already informed the Japanese side and agreed to resume negotiations tomorrow. Qin Dechun's request to resign as Acting Chairman has been met with a telegram from the central government urging him to stay. Qin insists on resigning because of the difficult situation and his intention to advance and retreat together with Song Zheyuan. He is determined to send another telegram requesting resignation. The telegram is being drafted and will be sent out within a day or two. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) Xiao Zhenying sent a long telegram to Chiang this morning, reporting on the progress of negotiations on the Zhangbei incident. (Special dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) He Yingqin telegraphed Qin Dechun on the 24th, stating that the country is in danger and that it is imperative to act. We have no room for hesitation regarding matters within our responsibility. We hope that you will bear the heavy burden and work together to overcome the crisis. I will do everything in my power to assist you and resolve all difficulties for you, based on our long-standing acquaintance and friendship. I specially send this telegram of reassurance, hoping that you will not decline out of modesty. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Peiping) After the Chinese and Japanese sides agreed on several principles at Qin Dechun's residence regarding the Zhangbei incident, our side immediately telegraphed the central government for instructions. On the evening of the 24th, Peiping received a reply from the central government, stating that the Chahar Provincial Government will continue to be responsible for the Zhangbei special case. As for the Sino-Japanese negotiations, the Japanese side will continue to conduct them, and it is expected that a resolution can be reached soon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>

Qin expressed his determination to advance and retreat together with Song and his intention to resign remained firm. It is reported that his second letter of resignation will be sent out soon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The North China problem has been largely resolved satisfactorily, and the Chahar incident is expected to be resolved within days. The Japanese government intends to use this as an opportunity to promote the original friendly relations between China and Japan. After the Chahar problem is resolved, Ambassador Arima and Commander of the Japanese Garrison in China, Umezu, will each issue a statement clarifying future policies towards China. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs will telegraph Ambassador Arima to emphasize the following points in the statement: 1. The Chinese side's thorough suppression of anti-Japanese actions is the first essential condition for promoting Sino-Japanese friendly relations. 2. It is hoped that China will resolve the pending issues that hinder Sino-Japanese friendly relations. 3. Japan is prepared to provide gradual economic assistance throughout China.

<p>(London) Silver prices have now fallen to the levels seen in April when the United States sought to raise domestic silver prices. This is due to short speculators rushing to close their positions in the past two days. Speculators have long awaited new developments in the US silver purchasing policy and are now growing weary. The silver market's foundation is stronger than before because many have been eliminated. Some say that the current silver market's lack of excitement is due to US silver prices being higher than world silver prices. This situation, coupled with the various difficulties encountered by the United States, should reassure silver proponents. However, some argue that the United States is still a major creditor nation, and silver seems to be what the United States wants to accept to offset debts. India's recent sale of large quantities of silver is puzzling. (Reuters dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<h3 id="e51">Implementing Compulsory Education and the Funding Problem <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— Ran</p>
<p>When discussing the implementation of compulsory education today, resolving the funding problem should be the primary concern. Since the promotion of education in the late Qing Dynasty, compulsory education has been advocated to promote the popularization of education. For decades, the government has set it as a policy and included it in the provisional constitution, and the people have also established associations to achieve it and conducted pilot tests in designated areas. However, the time spent and the efforts made have been significant, but the results achieved so far are minimal, and we are still waiting for all parties to plan how to effectively promote it. The crux of the matter is the difficulty in solving the funding problem. Recently, the government authorities decided to make the greatest effort to implement compulsory education. We sincerely hope that it will achieve effective results soon, and it is necessary to consider this difficult funding problem first.</p>
<p>According to the latest statistics released by the Ministry of Education, the number of school-age children in 31 provinces and cities across the country is 49,022,202. The number of children currently receiving compulsory education is 10,834,844. Therefore, the implementation of compulsory education really means setting up schools and teaching for the 38,187,358 children who have not received compulsory education. According to the statistics of the 18th year, the public should bear the annual cost of 6 yuan and 35 cents for each elementary school child. If more than 28 million children who are out of school enroll at the same time, an additional 240 million yuan would be required for education funding. This does not include the need to build new school buildings, add teaching equipment, and train teachers. At a time when the rural economy is very depressed, various miscellaneous expenses are being drastically reduced, and local education funding is extremely difficult, is the funding problem for the implementation of compulsory education not a cause for great anxiety?</p>
<p>However, the implementation of compulsory education does not necessarily require completion overnight. If there is determination, it may be possible to take a gradual approach. In this way, the allocation of funds can be carefully adjusted and effectively reorganized based on the existing economic capacity of the central government and various localities, and there may be a solution. We are specifically raising this funding problem not to say that it is still difficult to talk about the implementation of compulsory education today, but to awaken society's attention to raising compulsory education funds, thereby encouraging the general public to assist and supervise the government in realizing the true driving force of the compulsory education plan.</p>
<p>In all fairness, the compulsory education plan defined by the central government this time, starting with one-year short-term elementary schools and gradually progressing to the promotion and development of four-year compulsory education, is quite able to pay attention to reducing the difficulty of raising funds. Regarding the methods of raising funds, it is also stipulated that local fundraising and central subsidies should be the principle. At the beginning of implementation, each province and city should raise more than half of the funds required, and the central government will subsidize the shortfall, which should bring more convenience to the future of promotion. If the central government and local governments can follow this plan and earnestly implement it, and the people of various localities can also assist and supervise from the side, will it not become just a pie in the sky like the previous plans?</p>
<p>What is worrying is that since the promulgation of the outline of the compulsory education implementation plan, on the central government side, judging from the Ministry of Education's telegram to the Board of Directors of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund on the 6th of this month, there are no large amounts of funds available for compulsory education. On the provincial and municipal sides, judging from the replies received by the Ministry of Education, most hope that the central government will provide a large amount of assistance, and there are not many who have definite sources of funds for their own fundraising. The people are also very silent, seemingly taking a wait-and-see attitude, and have not expressed any views on the raising of funds. These are all phenomena that make the future of this compulsory education movement not optimistic.</p>
<p>Here, we deeply hope that the whole country, from top to bottom, will recognize the relationship between this compulsory education movement and the future of the country and the nation, confirm that the compulsory education implementation plan defined by the central government this time is a practical and feasible plan, and pay close attention to the above-mentioned unfavorable points, and work together to eliminate them with effective methods.</p>
<h3 id="e52">China's Efforts to Ban Opium: Brendon's Absurd Remarks, Hu Shize Writes to British Newspaper to Refute <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>(London) Brendon, who served as the Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council for many years, stated on June 14 that opium produced in China accounts for nine-tenths of the world's total production. Even if the Chinese do not plant poppies under the orders of local officials, they are still protected by local officials. This statement has now been refuted by Dr. Hu Shize, the representative of the League of Nations' Opium Advisory Committee. Dr. Hu today wrote to The Times, first refuting Brendon's claim that the Chinese representatives did not bring the true facts to the attention of the Advisory Committee, saying that the Chinese representatives never concealed the facts. Last November, they notified the League of Nations of the Chinese government's regulations on the planting and purchase of opium. According to these regulations, the Chinese government admits that it is impossible to completely ban opium immediately, but implements management of poppy planting and issues orders to gradually reduce planting in order to completely ban it by 1940. At the same time, poppy planting is limited to certain provinces. Dr. Hu also cited the remarks of other members of the Advisory Committee on China's efforts to ban opium, and especially cited the French representatives' testimony on the effectiveness of Chinese officials' opium ban in Fujian to refute the absurdity of Brendon's remarks.

<p>(London) British Sea Minister Monsell, amidst cheers in the Lower House today, answered questions about the Anglo-German agreement, stating that Germany will never again engage in unrestricted submarine warfare as it did during the European War. The German representative stated during the negotiation of this agreement that Germany is prepared to unconditionally comply with Article 4 of the London Naval Convention regarding submarine tactics. This article stipulates that merchant ships, except those that resolutely refuse to stop and submit to search, warships, whether surface or submarine, may not sink or disable the merchant ship without first transferring the passengers, crew, and documents of the merchant ship to a safe place, unless the weather is good, the waves are calm, or it is not far from land, or there are other ships nearby that can rescue the passengers and crew, in which case the merchant ship's lifeboats may not be regarded as a safe place. Monsell also stated that Germany is the only country that actually implements this compliance, along with the United States and Japan, because France and Italy have not yet ratified it.

<h3 id="e55">British Reply to French Note, Naval Conference to Open at Year's End, British Labour Party Criticizes Agreement with Germany <a href="#e55" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c55" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">55</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the Anglo-German naval agreement, the French government sent a note to the British government on the 17th, raising several objections. The British government prepared a written reply the day before yesterday. This reply has been delivered to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is said that the content is quite concise, stressing the benefits of convening a naval conference before the end of this year, and inviting French naval experts to London to hold talks in preparation for the future naval conference. Regarding this, although the French government is prepared to participate in the naval conference, it cannot recognize the Anglo-German naval agreement because it is bilateral in nature. Therefore, France is unwilling to conduct any negotiations related to this agreement. The French government insists on using the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3 as a basis to clarify the general policy first. This intention has never changed. (Havas dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(London) At the Lower House meeting today, Labour Party opposition members raised questions about the Anglo-German naval agreement. Most opposition members opposed the government's diplomatic actions, which was unexpected. Opposition members believe that the London Declaration of February 3 and the Stresa Conference decided on the principle of not entering into bilateral agreements and striving for collective action. The British government's current policy has abandoned this principle. Therefore, it is believed that the Lower House will debate the government's foreign policy next week.

<p>(Paris) Here, in order to cope with the situation created by the Anglo-German naval agreement, there is a strong sign of actively building ships. Judging from the situation, the French government will soon use 200 million francs from the naval budget. Although this fund has been included in the budget, it is stipulated that it will not be used before 1936. It is heard that the government has decided to ask the House of Representatives to vote to approve its early use. (National News dispatch from the 25th)</p>

Today's meeting is extremely important, and Sea Minister Pietri will also attend. (Havas dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<h3 id="e57">Abyssinian Problem, Core of Anglo-Italian Negotiations, Italy Continues to Transfer Troops to East Africa <a href="#e57" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c57" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">57</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) Today's confirmed news is that Italy intends to demand the implementation of its rule over Abyssinia, and is prepared to use force if necessary to achieve this goal. It is also heard that Prime Minister Mussolini is currently using the Anglo-German naval treaty as a pretext for this demand. Therefore, the world is paying close attention to the talks between British Minister for League of Nations Affairs Eden and Mussolini. According to reliable sources, Mussolini wants complete freedom of action regarding Abyssinia, because Abyssinia promised to abolish the slave system and build a strong central government when it joined the League of Nations, but these promises have not been fulfilled. Furthermore, Mussolini believes that the United Kingdom has signed the Anglo-German Naval Treaty and has ignored the League of Nations. Therefore, Italy cannot fulfill its responsibilities alone. According to external rumors, after Eden's talks with French Prime Minister Laval, Britain and France have reached an agreement, but Italian authorities believe that France will support Mussolini's actions against Abyssinia. Mussolini and Eden met for two hours today. After the meeting, a communique was issued stating: "Mussolini and Eden held a meeting at the Palazzo Venezia today. The Anglo-German naval agreement and the proposed air force convention, as well as other important issues contained in the Anglo-French London Agreement of February 3, were discussed." Although the communique did not mention the Abyssinian problem, the British Foreign Office has ordered Thompson, an expert on the Abyssinian problem, to assist Eden in handling the negotiations. Mussolini and Eden will continue their meeting tomorrow morning. (National News dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Eden and Mussolini spoke again this morning. Eden seems likely to return to Paris soon to exchange views with Laval again. Although the Italian newspapers unanimously advocate that no third party should interfere in the Italo-Abyssinian issue, it is generally felt that the subject of the Anglo-Italian talks is precisely this point. According to the Italian government, the Italo-Abyssinian issue is no longer a League of Nations issue, because Abyssinia could not fulfill its League of Nations obligations and abolish its slave system when it first joined the League of Nations. (National News dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) British Minister Without Portfolio Eden was originally scheduled to have a specialized talk with Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich this morning, but this talk did not take place. Eden is still scheduled to meet with Prime Minister Mussolini at 5:00 PM this afternoon, and will be accompanied by Thompson, the director of the Egyptian Department of the British Foreign Office. Thompson is an expert on the Abyssinian problem, which shows that the Abyssinian problem will definitely be part of the discussion when Eden and Mussolini talk. As for the Anglo-German naval agreement, the air force convention, and the Central European convention, after Eden's first talk with Mussolini, he requested instructions from the British government, and it seems that he is currently awaiting a reply from London. (Havas dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(London) Official circles here today denied that the British government is about to act as a mediator and ask Abyssinia to allow Italian protection, because Abyssinia is a member state of the League of Nations, and this kind of external rumor is incompatible with the League of Nations' status. (National News dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital The British Minister to Abyssinia, Sir Barton, is about to return home due to ill health. The Abyssinian King resolutely denied the rumor of a British-Abyssinian alliance, saying that Abyssinia still maintains normal relations. Britain's active intervention in the Italo-Abyssinian dispute can be regarded as new evidence of Britain's friendship with Abyssinia. (National News dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The news that the Italian government ordered Italian citizens to withdraw from Abyssinia within ten days shocked people here today, but the official circles later stated that this statement was inaccurate. The recent dispute between Italy and Abyssinia is due to the rumor that Abyssinia has incorporated the Kingdom of Jimma into its territory. However, according to Abyssinia's reply to the Italian note, only one supervisor has been sent to the country because the new king is too young. (Reuters dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a correspondent for the London Daily Express today, the Italian embassy in the Abyssinian capital has now ordered Italian citizens residing in Abyssinia to withdraw from Abyssinian territory within ten days. The correspondent continued that the Italian embassy has presented a stern note to the Abyssinian government, accusing it of interfering in Jimma's internal affairs and making it clear that it intends to annex this small country. The note further stated that if Abyssinia continues to do so, it will harm Italian interests more than anything else. The Italian government cannot ignore this and has formally expressed its reservations. (National News dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Sabada Division of the Army is now enlisting and training in Daglieri, and rumors are circulating that it is preparing to go to East Africa. The division's engineers unexpectedly held a drill last night. At dawn, they paraded through the city, singing the "Marching Song." Furthermore, Army Vice Minister Bestrocco inspected the Sixth Corps of the National Fascist Militia today. The team is now concentrated in Bodanzai, awaiting orders to go to East Africa. (Havas dispatch from the 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) From July 1, 1934, to June 1, 1935, the administrative expenses of Italian Eritrea and Somalia in East Africa totaled 845,000,000 lire. The temporary expenses for May of this year were 225,000,000 lire. Although Italy's temporary military expenses in East Africa have increased significantly, it is said that at the end of the current budget year, the financial deficit is less than at the end of the previous budget year. According to the draft budget for 1935-36, the total government revenue is estimated at 18 trillion lire, and the total expenditure is 196.5 billion lire. After offsetting revenue and expenditure, there is a deficit of 15 billion lire. This is the military expenditure used in East Africa. However, financial officials firmly believe that people from all walks of life in Italy will actively contribute to meet the needs of the country. (Havas dispatch from the 25th)</p>

<p>Belgrade – Stojadinović of Yugoslavia formed a new government today, concurrently holding the position of Foreign Minister. Representatives from various political parties, except for the group led by prominent Croat leader Dr. Maček, have joined, hence it is regarded as a government of reassurance. The new government intends to abolish the autocratic laws of the old government and prepare for general elections within a few months to establish democracy. It is reported that the previous government resigned due to the insult to the Croat people by the Speaker of the Parliament, leading to the resignation of three Serbian and Croat cabinet members. Consequently, Prime Minister Jevtić had no choice but to tender his resignation. (Reuter's telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Belgrade – Stojadinović, who has served as Finance Minister in the past, has formed a new cabinet, bringing the political turmoil in Yugoslavia to an end. The list of the new cabinet is as follows: Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Stojadinović (formerly of the Serbian Radical Party), Minister of the Army Živković, Minister of the Interior Korošec (formerly of the Slovenian People's Party), Minister of Transportation Spaho (formerly of the Bosnian Muslim Party), Minister of Public Works Babić (formerly of the Radical Party), Minister of Finance Letica (incumbent), Minister of Social Policy Pujeja (Croat), Minister of Agriculture Štenžar, Minister of Justice Olj (Croat), Minister of Commerce Rubenić (Croat), Minister of Youth Training Garaninović, Minister of Religious Affairs Štomović, and Ministers without Portfolio Ković and Bajman.</p>
<p>The cabinet was sworn in at 5 PM. However, it is believed here that the resolution of this cabinet crisis is only temporary. The inclusion of Spaho and Korošec in the cabinet is seen as a good omen, as it may gain the support of Bosnian Muslims and Slovenian Catholics. However, the efforts of Regent Prince Paul to bring in Maček, the leader of the Croat opposition party, were ineffective. He has returned to Zagreb on Sunday. Maček's party members insist on forming a neutral government that guarantees the implementation of secret ballot voting and the establishment of a constitutional parliament as soon as possible. The Croats do not see themselves as a political party, but as representatives of the Croat nation. They refuse to negotiate with any political party or government without their cooperation and claim they are only prepared to negotiate with the King and the Army. (Guomin News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>Belgrade – Former Finance Minister Stojadinović was ordered to form a cabinet and has now succeeded. Stojadinović has appointed himself Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, General Jevtić as Minister of the Army and Navy, and promoted incumbent Deputy Finance Minister Dušan Letica to Minister of Finance. Stojadinović declared to a Havas News Agency reporter that Yugoslavia's foreign policy will remain consistent. The new cabinet will continue to cooperate closely with the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente countries, and will also adhere to the Franco-Yugoslav alliance. The new cabinet has the support of the Serbian Radical Party, the Slovenian People's Party, the Bosnian Muslim Party, and a portion of the former Croat Peasant Party. As for the Croat opposition party led by Dr. Maček, they have adopted a neutral attitude. It is generally believed that after the formation of the new cabinet, national confidence can be expected to recover, which is essential for resolving the Croat national question and restoring the parliamentary system.

It can fly out and perform many difficult maneuvers at over 100 miles per hour, and finally land on the ground or water. The Air Force has been secretly using this aircraft as a target for a long time using radio control. This aircraft can fly from a ship and does not need to be seen by the radio controller.

<p>San Diego – US Navy Commander Reeves abruptly ordered the vanguard of the fleet to the North Pacific today to practice shooting in rough seas. According to the local naval authorities, this is a need discovered during the recent naval exercises. Because during the last exercise, the accuracy of the gunners decreased significantly as the fleet moved further north. The reason is that American gunners are not accustomed to working in the harsh environment of the North wind and rough waves. It is now reported that the fleet is scheduled to depart from San Francisco northwards on July 4th. (Guomin News Agency telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(Paris) – The International Chamber of Commerce Congress opened here today. More than a thousand business leaders from all over the world attended. Prominent British industrialist Lord Balfour said in his speech that the competition of Japanese goods in the world is beneficial and harmless. Lord Balfour cited Germany in the 19th century as an example, saying that at that time, due to the very low standard of living in Germany, industry was extremely developed. Although some people predicted that Germany would control most of the world's trade, the country's standard of living soon rose, wealth increased greatly, and it became one of the largest buyers of raw materials. On the contrary, high tariffs, import restrictions, and other trade barriers are of no benefit and cannot prevent competition. Japanese representative Ito said that Japan is a debtor nation and can only repay its debts through exports. Japan currently needs a supply of raw materials. Ito also appealed to the congress to assist and not hinder the progress of Japanese commerce. (Reuter's telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Paris) – The Economic Policy Group of the International Chamber of Commerce Federation, chaired by Herldering, President of the Air France Company, focused on discussing the Japanese goods competition issue raised in the report by Balfour, President of the Sheffield Chamber of Commerce in the United Kingdom. The report stated that "The phenomenon of new countries rising to compete with old countries in the market has existed since the era of Mediterranean trade. Now the commercial battlefield has shifted to the East, and Japan is a rising strong competitor. The reasons for Japan's foreign trade development are that Japan has studied the production methods of major countries around the world in detail, and that its people have a very low standard of living. Japan is a major purchaser of wool, cotton, other raw materials, and some manufactured goods. On the one hand, with its high-quality products and appropriate prices, it sells to the ten major ethnic groups in various places, which actually helps the development of general international trade. If the old industrial countries can slightly reform their production methods and innovative spirit, so that they can compete with countries with lower living standards, and can adapt to the times without being constrained by convention, the economic situation will greatly change and make us all satisfied."

<h3 id="e72">Japanese Finance Minister Explains to Cabinet Meeting; Budget Formulation Policy; Avoid Issuing More Public Bonds; Maintain Fiscal Balance <a href="#e72" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c72" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">72</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) – Today's regular cabinet meeting was held at the Prime Minister's official residence from 2 PM. Prime Minister Okada and all cabinet members attended. First, Finance Minister Takahashi read the budget formulation policy for the next fiscal year (Showa 11th year) and explained it in detail. Minister of the Army Hayashi, Minister of the Navy Osumi, Minister of the Interior Goto, Minister of Agriculture Yamazaki, and other cabinet members all asked questions to the Finance Minister, who answered them one by one. The entire cabinet unanimously approved the formulation policy, and the meeting adjourned at 4 PM. (Nichi-Ren telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) – Now that the budget formulation policy for the next fiscal year has been decided, Finance Minister Takahashi believes that it is necessary to inform the entire nation of the actual state of national finances. Therefore, after the cabinet meeting on the 25th, he announced the main points in the form of a talk, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The amount requested by each ministry each year easily reaches a huge sum of 2.8 billion or 2.9 billion yuan, and the new requests amount to a large sum of 1.3 billion or 1.4 billion yuan. However, the current financial situation is that the tax revenue is 800 million yuan, and the total ordinary revenue is about 1.4 billion yuan. It is clear that a financial system of this level cannot accommodate such large demands. (2) It is unavoidable to continue issuing a large number of public bonds next year. We cannot help but make such considerations. The issuance of a large number of public bonds began in Showa 7th year. The planned issuance quantity reached a maximum of 930 million yuan in Showa 8th year, then decreased to 881 million yuan in Showa 9th year, and further decreased to 771 million yuan in Showa 10th year. On average, it decreased by about 66 million yuan each year. There are many reasons why the current issuance of huge public bonds is relatively unhindered. The main reason is that the total budget has not expanded dramatically since Showa 8th year, and the number of newly issued public bonds has gradually decreased. Therefore, public trust in finance and public bonds has been maintained, which has been of great help. The number of new public bonds issued next year is aimed at the natural increase in revenue in the Showa 11th year budget, so the quantity is planned to be less than the new issuance number in the Showa 10th year budget. However, this plan is by no means to reduce the total budget. (3) Special accounting has recently increased due to economic recovery. The majority of the increase in revenue is distributed more to special accounting than ordinary accounting. However, its expenditure is not as much as ordinary accounting, because there are few special burdens increased due to national defense costs and other current situations. Therefore, special accounting should have considerable surplus, so new expenses can still be accounted for. Looking at the entire national financial situation, appropriate methods must also be considered regarding adjustments. The specific policies will be discussed with relevant parties after further research. (4) Each ministry should consider the overall financial situation and show concessions by mutually allocating their financial resources, regardless of territorial boundaries. This is what we hope for. (5) In view of the current financial situation, the number of personnel stipulated by officials must not be increased, and other expenses for promotions will not be reissued. This is especially hoped for. Officials must serve the public with sincerity and be consistent with the country. They should all show a spirit of opening up difficult situations and take the lead in setting an example, which is most important. (Nichi-Ren telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(Paris) – Recently, right-wing combat organizations, such as the "Fiery Crosses" led by de la Rocque, have been carrying out large-scale activities, which are likely to endanger Laval's truce of maintaining the constitutional system. Therefore, the left-wing feels uneasy. According to general opinion, the left-wing parties will raise this issue for discussion in the House of Representatives tonight. What makes the left-wing most terrified is that last Saturday, de la Rocque gathered 20,000 members of the "Fiery Crosses" and mobilized all of them within two hours to a certain place 30 miles away from Paris to hold a security exercise. De la Rocque personally delivered a passionate speech, the meaning of which was unpredictable. At the same time, Minister of Aviation Denain has been very close to de la Rocque recently, which especially makes the left-wing suspicious. Therefore, some members of parliament advocate impeaching the Minister of Aviation. It is expected that Laval will announce the adjournment of parliament soon. If so, parliament will not reconvene until November. (Guomin News Agency telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>US Silver: The New York silver market opened and futures prices fell by about 135 pounds sterling due to the decline in prices in London and Bombay.</p>
<p>Indian Silver: The decline in the Bombay silver market yesterday was due to many parties correcting their position of buying too much and closing out a lot. It seems that the United States only buys silver when the price falls, and not like before, when it also bought silver when the price rose. The bulls were disappointed, and the silver price fell.</p>
<p>Exchange Rate</p>

<p>British Wheat: The Liverpool wheat market continued to be sluggish this morning and lacked brilliance. Prices fell slightly due to good news from the US wheat market. At noon, the July futures price was five shillings and three pence halfpenny, down two-five from yesterday's close.</p>
<p>US Wheat: The Chicago wheat market opened lower by about half a cent due to the very good weather in the producing areas, the new wheat crop is about to be harvested, and the Liverpool telegram was low, and the Canadian situation was again uncertain. Shortly after the opening, prices trended upward, and coarse grains opened higher two-five due to the strong statistical position. Later, prices gradually loosened, falling below yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: The London rubber market was quiet this morning. At noon, the transaction price for July and September futures was six pence 〇25, the same as yesterday's price.</p>

<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: New York securities had little activity today because President Roosevelt advocated passing the entire new tax procedure in this congressional session. After the opening, prices of various securities generally fell. Oil stocks and steel stocks were especially reactive. After an hour of suffering, the market turned.

<h3 id="e103">Amidst Commercial Decline, the Hankou Market Presents a Depressing Scene; the Largest Cotton Mill and Money Exchange Announce Closure One After Another; Labor Disputes and Debt Litigation Cases are Extremely Numerous <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The details of the decline of commerce in Hankou due to natural disasters, banditry, and the impact of rural bankruptcy have already been described in a previous letter. However, the depressing scene in the market and the recent problems that have occurred have become more profound and serious in a short period of time. The only department store, Huaxing Company, suddenly announced its closure due to excessive losses. The Cantonese shareholders are unable to provide assistance, and there is no hope of resuming business. The China Steel Products Trading Company, which was also a powerful enterprise in Hankou, also went bankrupt last week with a debt of 450,000 yuan due to financial difficulties. Unfortunately, two extremely serious problems occurred simultaneously on the evening of the 22nd. One was the complete early shutdown of the First Cotton Mill, and the other was the sudden collapse of Yuyuan Silver Exchange, a major player in the money industry. The First Cotton Mill has been operated by the foreign creditor Arnhold Brothers &amp; Co. for five years. Due to the high cost of cotton and poor sales of yarn, it has been losing approximately 70,000 to 80,000 yuan per month, with accumulated losses of more than 4 million yuan. The shareholders of the mill are unable to invest more capital, and the preparations for the shutdown have been going on for several months. The final decision was made to shut down early on July 1st, leaving more than 500 workers unemployed. On the 23rd, all the employees sent representatives to request six months of severance pay. The manager, Song Lifeng, and the deputy manager, Li Gongjian, convened an emergency meeting of all shareholders on the 24th to discuss this matter, but no results have been achieved. Yuyuan Silver Exchange, located on Poyang Street in the Third Special District, has been the leader of the money industry in Hankou. On the evening of the 22nd, it had to close down due to financial difficulties. Its debts amounted to 2.2 million yuan. The manager, Wang Huiqing, and the deputy manager, Shi Sicheng, left Hankou one after another and entrusted lawyer Chen Zhuo and accountant Xie Lin to liquidate the debts on their behalf. The silver exchange's head office is located in Shanghai, and it has absorbed a large amount of deposits in Hankou. Its closure has had a huge impact on the financial community in Hankou. In addition, the decline of various industries is a widespread phenomenon. For example, the Jijishui Electric Company's income from water and electricity in May decreased by 40,000 to 50,000 yuan compared to the same month last year. The situation is even worse for those with weak capital. Furthermore, city government and court cases involving labor disputes and debt litigation are numerous. These serious problems cannot be solved in a short period of time. Currently, there are continuous heavy rains and the river is rising rapidly. The villagers are hoping for rain, but it has turned into bitter rain. If another flood unfortunately occurs, it is unknown what the situation will be like. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e104">Stabilizing Finances in Beiping; The City Government Discusses Preventive Measures with the Banking Community; Various Banks Form a Joint Treasury for Mutual Support <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Since the collapse of the Minghua Bank in Beiping, the Jushengyuan Silver Exchange followed suit due to financial difficulties. As of the 22nd, the financial turmoil has affected the Tonghexiang and Zhengyang Silver Exchanges, leading to widespread rumors and creating a serious situation. To stabilize public confidence and the financial market, the city government convened a meeting at 10 a.m. on the 21st, inviting the managers of over ten banks, including the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Continental Bank, Jin Cheng Bank, Yien Yieh Bank, and China South Bank, to discuss measures to prevent the turmoil. It was decided that the city government, the Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, and the Silver Money Industry Association would each nominate a representative to negotiate specific measures. The first meeting was held at 10 a.m. on the 22nd. Additionally, at 3 p.m. on the 11th, the city government summoned Zou Quansun, chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, Leng Jiaheng, committee member, Cai Yuan, director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Cheng Fan, director of the Finance Bureau, and Yu Jin, director of the Public Security Bureau, to discuss proper measures to maintain the silver exchanges. The following resolutions were made: (1) No silver exchange shall arbitrarily suspend or close business in the future. If any financial difficulties arise, the shareholders shall bear unlimited liability in accordance with the law and be subject to supervision by city government officials. (2) Fixed-term depositors in the silver exchanges shall not be allowed to discount and withdraw their deposits early. Ordinary depositors should also endure the difficulties together, mutually supporting each other and refraining from withdrawing large amounts of cash without reason, so as not to affect the financial market. These measures will be communicated to all members by the Chamber of Commerce and the Silver Money Industry Association, and the city government will also order the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus to supervise them at all times. Any violations will be treated as disrupting the financial market.</p>
<p>Regarding the financial turmoil, according to Mayor Yuan Liang, the recent closure of the Jushengyuan and Tonghexiang Silver Exchanges was exploited by malicious individuals to spread rumors. The closure of these silver exchanges was due to their own internal problems, and it does not have any significant impact on other banks or the city market. The city government has ordered the Public Security and Social Affairs Bureaus to investigate and order the two silver exchanges to be liquidated within two weeks. Furthermore, regarding the financial situation in Beiping, the city government has discussed stabilization and maintenance measures with the Beiping banking community and the City Chamber of Commerce, and it has been decided that there will be no further bank failures. The city government has ordered the Public Security Bureau to arrest anyone who fabricates rumors and attempts to create a panic, and to punish them for disrupting the financial market. The financial situation in the city should stabilize in the shortest possible time. To apprehend those who fabricate rumors and disrupt the financial market, the city government issued a special proclamation on the 21st stating: "Since this city's financial market has been stable for many years, the recent closure of the Jushengyuan Silver Exchange is solely due to its own problems and has no significant impact on other banks or the city market. The city government is investigating and ordering the exchange to be liquidated as quickly as possible. However, some ignorant individuals have taken the opportunity to spread rumors and cause alarm among the public. Some depositors in the silver exchanges have not investigated and have been alarmed, spreading false information and rushing to withdraw their deposits. It should be understood that the city's financial market is very stable. Such self-inflicted disturbances will not only harm both parties but will also affect the market. In addition to ordering the Public Security Bureau to conduct thorough investigation and suppression, anyone who fabricates rumors and attempts to incite others will be arrested immediately and punished to the fullest extent of the law. This proclamation is issued to be strictly observed."</p>
<p>Just as the city government was making efforts to quell the financial turmoil, a run on the China Agricultural and Industrial Bank occurred on the morning of the 22nd. The bank was well-prepared and allowed unlimited cash withdrawals. The various banks in Beiping also assisted in accepting and redeeming the bank's notes. The bank's business hours were extended by one hour on that day. Normal procedures were followed on the 23rd, a Sunday. Therefore, the number of those making withdrawals had decreased by 3 p.m. on the 22nd. Since the Public Security Bureau was ordered by the city government to arrest those who fabricated rumors and attempted to incite others, it began to make arrests on the 23rd. In one day, a total of fifteen people who refused to accept China Agricultural and Industrial Bank notes were arrested. They are currently under interrogation and will be charged with disrupting the financial market.</p>
<p>To stabilize the market, the various silver exchanges in Beiping have now united and formed a joint treasury, mutually supporting each other and bearing joint responsibility to avoid financial difficulties. At the first meeting to rescue the market, held at the city government at 11 a.m. on the 22nd, Mayor Yuan Liang attended and gave instructions. The meeting resulted in a decision that the Silver Money Industry Association would mortgage a four million yuan loan note to the Banking Association for two million yuan in cash to assist in circulation. At 9 a.m. on the same morning, the Chamber of Commerce held an emergency meeting, inviting representatives from various merchants to attend. Chairman Zou Quansun delivered a speech, hoping that all members would consider the overall situation and work together under the principles established by the city government to maintain the financial market, so as not to allow the Beiping financial market to collapse further. Based on the above situation, it is hoped that the financial turmoil in Beiping will be quelled in a very short period of time. (22nd)</p>
<h3 id="e105">Overseas Chinese in Vietnam Eagerly Hope to Improve the Sino-Vietnamese Trade Treaty—Presenting Eight Points to the Government <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Shantou Correspondence: The Pacific liner from Saigon arrived in Shantou yesterday, carrying a large number of unemployed overseas Chinese returning home. According to one of them, there used to be over 300,000 overseas Chinese engaged in trade in Vietnam. However, due to the decline of industry and commerce in recent years, the number has decreased by about 100,000. Therefore, unemployed overseas Chinese are continuously returning home, and the cargo transportation business in Southeast Asia is also shrinking. This is truly regrettable. Before the expiration of the old treaty in 1929, Vietnamese goods imported into China, such as rice, timber, etc., were worth about 50 to 60 million yuan, while Chinese goods imported into Vietnam were worth about 10 million yuan. After the expiration of the old treaty, the Vietnamese authorities treated Chinese goods as goods from countries without treaties, levying taxes at rates that were increased by more than twenty times. For example, Chinese silk fabrics, paper, porcelain, tea, fruits, and other goods were subjected to heavy taxes, causing the total value of exports to Vietnam to drop from 50 to 60 million yuan per year to 3 to 4 million yuan, falling to one-twentieth of the original amount. Currently, the Shantou Nanyang Business Association is continuing to regulate and allocate shipments before a new Sino-Vietnamese treaty is officially concluded, in order to avoid excessive losses. At the same time, Vietnamese goods sold in China are affected due to the common economic contraction. Therefore, merchants and residents of Guangdong and overseas Chinese in Vietnam believe that the signing of the appendices to the Sino-Vietnamese trade treaty is crucial to the prosperity or decline of their industries and commerce in the future. Therefore, the overseas Chinese have listed eight items and requested the government to improve them when concluding the treaty: (1) Improve the new regulations for Chinese immigrants. Any inhumane practices should be abolished in the spirit of Sino-French friendship, such as fingerprinting at the immigration office, having people enter iron sheds, and moving luggage through clothing inspection booths. (2) Reduce taxes on Chinese goods entering Vietnam. Transit taxes should be levied according to the Siberian-European cargo transit methods for goods transferred from Haiphong to Yunnan and Guangxi, and should not be subject to transit taxes. (3) Reduce the burden on overseas Chinese residents. The annual residence tax (head tax) should be kept to a minimum, at least at the same level as in Singapore and Thailand. (4) Since China governs the country by party, Vietnamese officials should not send detectives to monitor the actions of overseas Chinese party members or their meetings, and party-state documents should not be arbitrarily inspected or confiscated. (5) Do not excessively interfere with the education of overseas Chinese. Restrictions on the curriculum and the required number of hours for French language courses should be lifted. The teaching of party doctrine and the strict selection of teachers should not be exempted. (6) The inspection of local Chinese newspapers is limited to submitting manuscripts at noon every day, resulting in many important news items being missed. New items unrelated to local laws are often arbitrarily removed, and there are no standard restrictions on the entry of domestic newspapers and magazines. (7) Do not abuse exit orders by arbitrarily ordering the departure of intellectuals deemed to be extremist elements. There should be certain restrictions in the future. (8) If the children of overseas Chinese students want to return to China, they must find a shop to guarantee that they will return to Vietnam within a specified period. If they die in China, a report must be made to the Vietnamese consulate for verification. Overseas Chinese in Vietnam request that the central government negotiate with the French side to improve the above items.</p>

<p>Diao Yushan, patrolman No. 6 of the second detachment of the first district of the Water Police Team, was patrolling the vicinity of the Xindongmen bus station today when he noticed a suspicious person among the disembarking passengers. He immediately went forward to question him. The passenger looked flustered and spoke hesitantly, which made him even more suspicious. He searched him and found twenty taels of Yunnan opium and thirty taels of Sichuan opium, a total of fifty taels, marked with a lion symbol. He took him back to the detachment for interrogation. The man confessed that his name was Jin Yuqi, from Hebei, 40 years old, living at No. 15 Daxing Street, Shanghai, and that he was a vegetable seller. He said that a friend named Zhang had bought the opium and asked him to carry it, and that Zhang would receive it at the station and pay him five yuan. Based on the confession, Detachment Leader Hu immediately submitted the case to the Third Brigade Headquarters for investigation.</p>

The second section of the project was initially inspected by a technician from the county government, who found several points for improvement. Director Shen Fuyun instructed the original contractor, Chen Guozhi, to make the necessary improvements. However, work was halted after the dried area was filled with water due to three days of heavy rain. Today, Gu Houxi, a technician from the Construction Department, came to Songjiang, accompanied by Director Shen and Section Chief Xu, to measure and inspect the work site. He returned to the province on the same day. It remains to be seen whether the section of the project is up to standard, and we are awaiting instructions. However, the public is eager to have the canal opened as soon as possible to allow the water to flow.</p>

<p>Shi Heying, a 21-year-old female worker at the Yumin Weaving Factory outside the East Gate of Wuyi, who was from the Shijia Village near the factory, was working the night shift at the factory when, on the late night of the 23rd, she took advantage of a moment of unguardedness and hanged herself by the stairs in the front of the factory. The factory immediately sent someone to notify her family and reported the incident to the Public Security Bureau for relay to the County Court for examination. Prosecutor Guan Junjie went to examine the body on the 24th and confirmed that she had died by hanging. The body was prepared by her family in a coffin and collected. As for the reason for the female worker's suicide, it is said to be due to unhappy marriage. It is said that the deceased had been betrothed to someone by her parents, but the marriage was called off because she was not liked by her in-laws, and she returned to her parents' home. Recently, her parents arranged for her to marry someone named Bai, and the wedding was approaching. The female worker, saddened by the pain of being a child bride and the unhappiness of marriage, developed a world-weary attitude.</p>

<p>Xiaosibu, located in the Toupeng Township of eastern Xiaoshan, faces Haining County across the river and is densely populated. The original sandbank along the riverfront was approximately 30,000 mu. In recent years, the river's course has changed dramatically, and the intensity of the tides is unprecedented. Consequently, the riverbank has collapsed rapidly, and the entire 30,000 mu of mature sandbank has been submerged. Many residents have been forced to relocate. Recently, the riverbank collapse in that area has become severe and extremely dangerous. The base of the Gao Zhengxing Public Office and a small number of street foundations have already fallen into the water. Residents are dismantling their homes in a rush, and some are even unable to relocate in time. Impoverished farmers who are suffering from the riverbank collapse are displaced and destitute. Their cries of misery fill the air, a truly unbearable sight. It is hoped that the authorities will find a way to provide relief.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Director Huang Boqiao of Two Railway Bureaus Returned to China Yesterday - His Investigation of Railway Industries in Various Countries Was Very Thorough - A Chronic Illness Was Completely Cured After Treatment in Austria <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Huang Boqiao, Director of the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureaus, returned to Shanghai yesterday aboard the Norddeutscher Lloyd ship "Scharnhorst" after being ordered by the Ministry of Railways to investigate railway industries in Europe and America and seeking treatment from famous doctors in Austria for his chronic illness. Many of his relatives, friends, and subordinates went to welcome him. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Returning by Ship</p>
<p>Director Huang departed from Shanghai on August 21st of last year to conduct his investigation. He first traveled east to Japan, stayed for about a week, and then took a ship to Canada and the United States. He then crossed the Atlantic Ocean to Europe, visiting countries such as England, Germany, France, Belgium, Austria, the Czech Republic, and Switzerland. He investigated the railway industries of various countries along the way in great detail, paying particular attention to the railway industries of England and Germany, where he stayed for a longer period. The British government and public also paid close attention to Huang's visit to England. Now, having completed his investigation, he returned to China aboard the "Scharnhorst."</p>
<p>Welcoming Relatives and Friends</p>
<p>The "Scharnhorst," carrying Director Huang, arrived in port at 8:00 AM yesterday. Among those who came to welcome him were Li Muyuan, Director of the Procurement Committee of the Ministry of Railways; Li Dachao, representative of Mayor Wu Tiecheng; Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau; and senior officials from the Railway Bureau, including Xu Yuanfang, Mo Heng, Xiao Weiguo, Liu Dingxin, Pu Dengqing, Hu Jicong, Cao Shengzhi, Ma Shaoping, Wang Bi, Wu Xihan, as well as Huang's relatives and friends, totaling more than thirty people.</p>
<p>Arrival in Shanghai</p>
<p>The "Scharnhorst" arrived at the Songkou port around 6:00 PM yesterday and docked at the Gongxiang Wharf at around 8:00 PM. When the ship docked, the ship's band played music in celebration. The welcoming party immediately boarded the ship. Director Huang, dressed in a white long gown, appeared refined and greeted the welcoming party in the guest room, shaking hands and chatting with them. He then told reporters that the investigation had been lengthy and that he would discuss the details with them at a later date. After speaking, he accompanied his wife to return to their residence to rest.</p>
<p>Chronic Illness Completely Cured</p>
<p>Before going abroad, Director Huang suffered from chronic diabetes, which recurred several times, causing soreness in both arms and threatening blindness in one eye. Although he had taken leave to seek treatment in Moganshan, he had not fully recovered. During this trip to Europe, he sought treatment from famous doctors in Austria, and his chronic illness has been cured. Director Huang used to wear black glasses to avoid bright light, but now he wears white crystal glasses, indicating a return to normalcy. His spirit is also very vigorous.</p>
<p>Arriving at the Bureau This Morning</p>
<p>Director Huang will arrive at the bureau this morning to resume his duties. He will also draft a report on the course of his investigation and will travel to Beijing within a few days to report everything to the Minister of Railways in person. Colleagues at the two railway bureaus are scheduled to hold a dinner party at the New Asia Hotel at noon on the 29th to welcome Director Huang.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Consul Feng Zhizheng, Stationed in Amsterdam, Netherlands, Returned to China Yesterday - Said That the Anti-Chinese Sentiment in the Dutch East Indies Has Been Repeatedly Protested - However, Their Treatment of Overseas Chinese in the Netherlands is Still Good <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reported that Feng Zhizheng, our country's Consul General in Amsterdam, Netherlands, returned to China on leave, accompanied by his wife, sons, and daughters, aboard the Norddeutscher Lloyd ship "Scharnhorst" which arrived in Shanghai at 8:00 PM last night. On the ship, Feng Zhizheng told a reporter from the Xin Sheng News Agency that he had been stationed abroad for more than nine years. This time, he was returning to China on leave from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Overseas Chinese merchants in the Netherlands have been affected by the global economic downturn. In the past, there were more than 3,000 overseas Chinese, but in recent years, the number has gradually decreased, and now there are only about 1,000 left. The Dutch government treats our overseas Chinese fairly well. However, there are indeed cases of harsh treatment of our compatriots in the Dutch East Indies. The embassy in the Netherlands has repeatedly received reports and has protested to the Dutch government several times, and the authorities have promised to improve the situation. Because the Dutch government's policies differ between its domestic territories and overseas colonies, the Dutch East Indies discriminates against Chinese, while the Netherlands itself treats overseas Chinese relatively well. After resting in Shanghai for one or two days, I will go to Beijing to report everything to the authorities. In the future, I plan to remain in the Ministry and await further assignment.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Liu Haisu Returned to China Yesterday - Described the Progress of the Art Exhibition in the United States <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>Liu Haisu, President of the Shanghai Art College, and his wife, who were sent by our government to participate in the Sino-German Art Exhibition in Berlin, Germany, have been abroad for two years. Liu has now returned to China aboard the Norddeutscher Lloyd ship "Scharnhorst" from Germany after the exhibition concluded. He arrived at the Gonghexiang Wharf at 8:00 PM last night. More than one hundred of Liu's friends and students from Meihui went to welcome him. According to Liu, speaking to a reporter from the Central News Agency, Haisu was ordered to go abroad to Europe on November 13th of the 22nd year of the Republic to organize the Sino-German Art Exhibition. Upon arriving in Berlin, the capital of Germany, in December, Professor Kommel, Director-General of the German Museum, and renowned art historians Dr. Kong William and Dr. Leitmann immediately launched a grand welcome party. After arriving in Germany, he urgently prepared with the German committee, which took many twists and turns before finally opening on January 20th at 10:00 AM at the Prussian Academy of Arts in Berlin. The exhibition lasted for 45 days, with 4,000 to 5,000 visitors each day. All sectors of Germany praised it unanimously, and it also attracted the attention of various European countries. Hamburg, Munich, the Rhineland provinces, the Netherlands, Switzerland, the Czech Republic, France, Italy, England, and Poland, among other countries, subsequently sent letters and telegrams requesting the exhibition. Haisu reported to the government, which gradually approved the requests. Therefore, the exhibition toured various countries. However, all the expenses, in Berlin, were allocated 35,000 marks by the Executive Yuan, which were used up according to the Preparatory Office's budget. The exhibition expenses in other countries and regions were all subsidized by local art academies or municipal governments. Until the day Haisu returned east, countries such as the United States, Turkey, Austria, and Poland continued to send telegrams to welcome him. The schedule of exhibitions is listed below in chronological order: (1) Berlin, Germany, venue: Prussian Academy, 140,000 visitors, 53 works sold; (2) Hamburg, Germany, venue: Hamburg Academy of Arts, 56,000 visitors, 19 works sold; (3) Düsseldorf, Rhineland, Germany, venue: Düsseldorf Art</p>
<h3 id="e119">Commercial and Industrial Loans Will Be Implemented Soon - Expected to Begin Lending Before July 5th - The Loan Committee Has Drafted Loan Collateral - Mortgage Credit and Two Types of Lending Will Be Held Simultaneously <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Shanghai Commercial and Industrial Loan Committee's regulations for guaranteeing loan recipients, organizational charters, procedures, detailed rules for guaranteeing loans, etc., have all been approved at the third meeting. Chairman Cai Zengji has prepared a document and submitted it to the Ministry of Finance for approval and promulgation. The office set up by the association on the second floor of the National Goods Bank has been prepared and is scheduled to open before July 5th. A reporter from the Xin Xin News Agency learned of the situation from banking circles yesterday, and details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening on July 5th</p>
<p>The office set up by the Commercial and Industrial Loan Committee on the second floor of the National Goods Bank has been prepared. The association's telephone number will be the same as the National Goods Bank's number, but a separate extension will be installed for contact. Staff will also be assigned. Currently, preparations are underway to invite several experts to provide guidance on improving technology in various factories and correcting the business direction of commercial firms after the loans are released. The association is scheduled to open before July 5th to accept loan applications from commercial and industrial firms. The 1st and 2nd of July are bank holidays.</p>
<p>Designated Banks and Money Shops to Lend</p>
<p>This loan will be divided into two types: mortgage loans and credit loans. Mortgage loans will be limited to 15 million, and credit loans will be limited to 5 million. The association will designate banks and money shops to lend. All factories manufacturing national goods, commercial firms selling national goods, and those transporting national goods for export are eligible to apply for loans. The collateral of various factories and commercial firms will be the first guarantee, and national treasury certificates will be the second guarantee. The association may send personnel at any time to supervise and inspect the use of loans by various factories and commercial firms to prevent them from being diverted for other purposes.</p>
<p>Specified Types of Loan Collateral</p>
<p>According to inquiries by reporters from the Xin Xin News Agency, factories or commercial firms applying for loans must submit commodities, machinery, valuable securities, and other collateral. However, (1) commodities must be easily salable, not easily perishable, insured by reputable firms, and stored in warehouses; (2) machinery, regardless of the type, must be the latest model with fast manufacturing capacity and speed; (3) securities must be government bonds or other valuable stocks issued by the central and local governments.</p>
<p>Two Repayment Deadlines are Set</p>
<p>The market price or valuation of collateral for mortgage loans must be determined by experts. For credit loans, only two reputable commercial firms need to provide joint and several guarantees. However, the total amount requested may not exceed half of the capital and public reserve of each factory or commercial firm. The monthly interest rate for both mortgage and credit loans may not exceed eight percent. If a factory or commercial firm cannot afford the full monthly interest, the lending banks and money shops may apply to the loan association to submit it to the Ministry of Finance for approval and subsidy of two percent monthly interest. The repayment period for mortgage loans is one year, and the repayment period for credit loans can follow the usual practice of repayment at the end of each closing period. Academy of Arts in Düsseldorf, 40,000 visitors, 15 works sold; (4) Amsterdam, Netherlands, venue: Oriental Museum of the River City; (5) The Hague, Netherlands, venue: The Hague Museum, more than 48,000 visitors; (6) Paris, France, venue: the Academy of Joint Arts, Liu Haisu's personal painting exhibition; (7) Geneva, Switzerland, venue: Geneva Museum of History and Art, 45,000 visitors, 16 works sold; (8) Bern (Swiss capital), Switzerland, venue: Bern Art Building, 49,500 visitors; (9) Geneva, Switzerland, venue: Geneva Chinese International Library. Because people from various countries gathered for the League of Nations General Assembly in September, they repeatedly entrusted Haisu to host a Chinese art exhibition on their behalf to promote it. Haisu transported 200 new works from Berlin in the shortest possible time, and borrowed 300 pieces of porcelain and lacquerware from the Ming and Qing Dynasties from various collectors, which were exhibited in the City Hall for a month starting on September 12, and were highly praised by representatives from various countries; (10) London, England, venue: New Burlington Galleries, 103,000 visitors, 26 works sold; (11) Prague (Czech capital), Czech Republic, venue: Prague Museum, 40,000 visitors.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reported that the measures to rescue commercial and industrial loans will be implemented immediately after approval and promulgation by the Ministry. As the banks' semi-annual settlement is approaching, reconciliation is busy, and the financial situation has stabilized. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Bank Settlement</p>
<p>The end of June is the semi-annual settlement period for banks. The Bankers' Association of Shanghai has scheduled its eighth member general meeting for 4:00 PM on the afternoon of the day after tomorrow to report on the association's affairs for the half-year. Banks have been very busy with settlement and reconciliation in recent days. The total amount exchanged at the Bank Clearing House yesterday was 11,919,718.73 silver dollars. The public loan interest rate was 0.20, and the public loan discount rate was 0.25. Reconciliation between money shops and banks is busier than usual. The additional water rate for the head was 0.70 yesterday, and the foreign discount was over 0.20, which proves the busy settlement of the two industries.</p>
<p>Financial Stability</p>
<p>Yesterday, reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency learned from banking and money shop circles that the money shops were rescued with 2.5 million yuan of financial public bonds allocated by the Ministry of Finance. The banks have become more flexible in their operations after the interbank lending by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Communications Bank, which has indirectly rescued industry and commerce. As for the 20 million yuan in commercial and industrial loans, the implementation is imminent, so Shanghai's financial situation has stabilized. The end of June, the semi-annual settlement period for banks, will be able to pass peacefully.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Post Office Launches Transfer Telegraphic Money Order <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal Administration Savings and Remittance Notice No. 45 states that in order to make public remittances faster, each post office in this district has now launched transfer telegraphic money orders. The procedures are as follows: (1) The initial transfer of the telegraphic money order is to use an ordinary money order, stamp it with the words "Transfer Telegraphic Money Order," and hand it over to the remitter, who will mail the money order by registered mail to the telegraphic money order transfer office for verification, without needing to prepare a separate letter. If the payment office has direct telegraphic transfer facilities, the transfer office will directly telegraph the money to the payment office. If the payment office does not have direct telegraphic transfer facilities, it will be transferred by mail through the nearest telegraphic money order transfer office to the payment office. However, the public should note that remitting money using a transfer telegraphic money order is only effective under certain circumstances, such as when the payment office is far away from the remitting office. If an ordinary money order is faster according to the situation, the post office should temporarily notify the remitter. (2) In addition to collecting ordinary money order fees, if a reply is required, a reply fee should be charged. An additional telegraphic transfer fee of 25 cents and a telegraph fee of 60 cents per telegraphic money order should also be charged. If the telegraph exceeds 20 words, an additional 5 cents per word should be charged for the excess words. (3) To expedite the payment of the transfer telegraphic money order, the remitter should clearly state the name and address of the payee in detail. (4) After the remitter has paid the remittance and the various fees mentioned in Section 2 above, they should properly keep the receipt issued by the post office (the second copy of the money order application form with the added word). This receipt should be presented for any subsequent inquiries about the money order. (5) If the payee of the transfer telegraphic money order cannot prove that they are the payee, the money order should be paid with a guarantor. (6) For other details, please inquire at the money order office of each post office. This is hereby announced for general information.</p>

<p>Zhenjiang has been hit by three major storms in a row. This Sunday, a sudden gale rose, accompanied by heavy rain. From morning till night, the storms did not cease. Countless civilian boats and barges along the Zhenjiang riverbank were hit and damaged by the violent winds and rain. The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Zhenjiang branch had just been taken over by Director Xin Yaoxiang of the inland river shipping Zhenjiang branch, and the ships were docked at the river wharf. However, before the ships were assigned to any schedules, they were damaged by the waves in the river, causing considerable damage.</p>
<p>Three Ships Damaged in a Row. The Li Hang, which runs the Zhenjiang-Yangzhou line, was anchored on the riverbank when it was battered by the heavy storm. The hull suffered major damage. Two or three zhang of the ship's port side was smashed, and the wooden rail at the stern was completely destroyed by the raging waves. The extent of the damage is difficult to describe. In addition, the Mao Li and Kuai Li were struck by the wind and waves, and the railings on both sides of the two ships were completely destroyed. One of the large wooden beams was broken by the huge waves, and the hulls of both ships were also damaged and flooded. All three ships are unusable.</p>
<p>Request for Inspection and Repair. Yesterday, Xin Yaoxiang, director of the Zhenjiang branch, sent a detailed report to the Shanghai General Office after inspecting and verifying the damage to the ships, requesting the Shanghai General Office to send engineers to Zhenjiang as soon as possible to inspect the damage so that they can be repaired and officially put into service on the inland river routes. Xin also stated that inland river ships are usually repaired in Jiangyin, but the three ships are so badly damaged that they cannot be sailed to Jiangyin and can only be inspected and repaired in Zhenjiang. Yesterday, the head office was discussing sending staff to Zhenjiang to inspect and estimate the repairs.</p>

<h3 id="e127">International Communist Party: Arrest of Strange Westerner Continues; Yuan Shu Arrested in Connection with the Same Case <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Shanghai's Japanese newspapers yesterday published news about Yuan Xueyi's arrest. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to the Municipal Government to inquire about it. According to the person in charge of the Municipal Government, all the details recorded in the Japanese newspapers are not factual. It was found that when the Garrison Headquarters, together with the Public Concession Police, cracked the case of the Communist International's "Ge Bo Wu" (G.P.U.) and a strange Westerner of unknown nationality named Joseph Waldron, letters and address proofs between Yuan Shu (i.e., Yuan Xueyi) and Joseph Waldron were found in his pocket, proving that Yuan Shu had a close relationship with the International "Ge Bo Wu" organization. He was arrested as a secret worker under the strange Westerner, and it was by no means as the Japanese newspapers claimed that he was arrested for relying on someone who had dealings with the Japanese or the so-called Blue Shirts Society, which is completely unfounded. After the case was solved, it was discovered that Yuan Shu had many aliases, such as Yuan Xueyi, Yuan Xiaotao, Rong Jun, Li Huimin, etc., all of which were used by Yuan Shu. Mr. Yamada Junzaburo came to the government a few days ago to inquire about Yuan Xueyi's arrest. Mayor Wu clarified that Yuan Xueyi and Yuan Shu are the same person and explained the reasons for the arrest in detail. The person in charge of the Municipal Government also stated that Yuan Shu was originally a Communist who surrendered, but he was fickle and, after his apostasy, was repeatedly directed by the Communist Party to carry out counter-intelligence work. It was only after the strange Westerner's case was solved that his conspiracy was discovered. Currently, Yuan Shu and the strange Westerner have been sent to the competent court for joint handling of the case.</p>

<p>The Shanghai All-Groups United Association for Aiding Overseas Chinese in Siam yesterday began banning the sale of Siamese rice in the Taichang market. In addition to sending telegrams to Guangzhou and other places to uniformly boycott it, a public letter was specially sent to the Rice Merchants' Association in this city, asking it to notify its members to boycott Siamese rice by a set deadline. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respectfully informing you, this time the Siamese government's anti-Chinese actions have aroused public outrage. Our Shanghai All-Groups United Association for Aiding Overseas Chinese in Siam initiated a protest, and compatriots at home and abroad have responded successively, originally hoping to prompt the Siamese government to realize its errors, cancel all kinds of harsh anti-Chinese regulations. However, the Siamese government not only turned a deaf ear but also intensified its actions, trying to cover up its faults and mislead the Chinese people. After deliberation at the third executive meeting on the 22nd of this month at 2 p.m., it was decided to send a letter to the rice merchants in this port, requesting them to boycott Siamese rice by a set deadline, and to telegraph rice merchants' associations in Guangzhou and other places to unanimously boycott it. We are writing to your association, hoping that you will inform your members to boycott Siamese rice by a set deadline so that overseas Chinese in Siam can be freed from all kinds of shackles and suffering as soon as possible. We are very grateful for your public spirit. Respectfully, Shanghai Rice Merchants' Association, Shanghai All-Groups United Association for Aiding Overseas Chinese in Siam."</p>
<h3 id="e129">National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Cables Ministry of Finance, Requesting Return of Confiscated Treasury Silver <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: "Respectfully addressed to the Ministry of Finance, Nanjing. We have recently received a jointly sealed letter from Song Pinting, manager of the Deshengyong Silver Shop in Shanhaiguan, and 105 other firms, including Yongyuhang. The letter states that merchants have traditionally operated the Deshengyong Silver Shop in Qitiaohutong in Shanhaiguan city, with branch offices in Nanguan outside the city, engaging in financial remittance and exchange, as well as buying and selling remittance drafts. Historically, because the main and branch offices are located inside and outside the city walls, the branch offices outside the city often collect and store remittance funds. To ensure safety, they are transported to the main office inside the city for storage, ready for remittance procedures if needed. Every day, special delivery personnel carry public receipts, i.e., return receipts, for delivery purposes. The funds are stored in nature, so they are not recorded in any accounts. Usually, there are hired workers specifically for delivering scattered cash payments within the street. However, carrying cash and banknotes on the road is most easily targeted by bandits, creating a risk of robbery. Therefore, merchants traditionally prepare vests, commonly known as 'silver bags,' with two pockets on the left and right sides, specifically for the cash delivery personnel to wear, so that they can carry cash discreetly, thus slowing down the pirates' plan to steal the sea. This kind of vest is a common custom for merchants, and it has been around for a long time. (Omitted middle section). Unexpectedly, on the 24th of last month, the Qinhuangdao Shanhaiguan branch card dispatched many people to search the main office and confiscated 12,675 yuan of silver in the vault, as well as silver bags and remittance slips, falsely accusing them of smuggling. The staff members Song Zun and Chen Jinsheng were detained by the local Public Security Bureau. Although 105 reputable merchants in the area jointly testified that it was not smuggling, the negotiations were ineffective. The branch card arbitrarily searched and confiscated the treasury silver, falsely accusing it of smuggling. We do not know where the 'private' comes from or where the 'transport' begins. As for the silver bags worn by the silver delivery personnel, they are used for concealing cash deliveries within the street to prevent bandits from coveting them. This kind of custom is also common among silver shops and cash delivery personnel. According to our knowledge, although the use of silver bags has decreased since the establishment of the bank clearing house in Shanghai, they are still used occasionally. They cannot be regarded as evidence of smuggling. Furthermore, the silver delivery slips are clear receipts for the arrival of silver and can be traced back to the original root, which is sufficient to prove it. May we ask, every silver shop in Shanghai stores hundreds of thousands of cash, which is not a small amount. And every shop also has silver bags for silver delivery personnel and silver delivery slips. According to this logic, could this also be considered evidence of smuggling? How can this be reasonable? Most of the silver confiscated from the shop was entrusted by various customers for remittance and exchange of goods in Tianjin. There are also ticket stubs that can be checked. However, when the Tianjin remitting party heard the news of the confiscation, they rushed to the market to exchange the drafts, hindering financial transactions and causing great panic. In order to clarify the facts, we respectfully request your association to forward our request to return the confiscated silver to maintain financial stability. Therefore, we jointly send this telegram to your ministry for review. We implore you to consider the suffering of the merchants and promptly order the Qinhuangdao Customs to correct this overstepping action and return all the confiscated treasury silver to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. Respectfully and urgently. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce of the Republic of China, with seal."</p>

<h3 id="e131">International Telegraph Office to Build Large-Scale Transmitting Station; Site Located Near Qianliangmiao Station, Land to be Purchased, and Private Land to be Circled and Purchased Next Month for Construction <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>The International Telegraph Office's Shanghai Radio General Station's transmitting station, attached to the Shanghai Middle School in Lujiabang, Nanshi, is located in a narrow area that is insufficient for its use. The staff members have found 300 acres of private land within the 51st map of the 26th Bao in Xixi Township, near the Qianliangmiao Station on the Shanghai-Minhang-Nanzhe Road, north of the Changqiao Town, as the site for building a large-scale transmitting station. The engineer has prepared the construction drawings and submitted them to the Ministry of Communications for approval and transfer to the Ministry of Interior for collection in accordance with the Land Expropriation Law. Later, due to the January 28 Incident, it was suspended. The bureau is now facing the rapid development of wireless telegraph services and urgently needs to add a transmitting machine. Therefore, the construction of the transmitting station is imminent. It is approved to start circling and purchasing private land next month in order to proceed with the construction.</p>
<h3 id="e132">Shaanxi Province Construction Loan: Banks in this City Refuse to Accept; Using Land as Mortgage is Inconsistent with Regulations; Banks Negotiate and Send Letters to Branches Rejecting Politely <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, Shao Lizhi, Chairman of the Shaanxi Provincial Government, believes that Shaanxi's construction projects urgently need to be promoted, but the provincial treasury is empty and the economy is in difficulty. The Construction Department and the Municipal Construction Committee of the Provincial Government took the lead in contacting the Xi'an branches of Chinese, Communications, Jin City, Shanghai, Zhejiang Industrial and other banks, intending to use land as collateral and the central government's monthly construction funds as guarantee to sign a construction loan of 300,000 yuan with the banks. After several contacts, each branch signed a letter of opinion and submitted it to the Shanghai head office for instructions. According to banking news yesterday, the banking community should assist Shaanxi authorities in borrowing construction loans, as it is related to the municipal construction of Xijing. However, the proposed mortgage and guarantee are improper and cannot be accepted according to regulations. Therefore, after consultation with the authorities, it was decided to politely reject it. The original letter is recorded as follows: "Respectfully informing you, we previously received a letter reporting that the Xi'an Municipal Construction Committee intends to mortgage the land in the new urban area to the banking group for a loan of 300,000 yuan, requesting your instructions, and a copy of the letter and mortgage overdraft loan agreement from the committee has been received and reviewed. As the construction of roads in Xijing is related to municipal construction, we should all assist. However, the use of land as a mortgage cannot be accepted according to regulations. Furthermore, it is inappropriate to designate the central government's monthly construction funds as a guarantee. There are many obstacles in the negotiation. Therefore, we are writing to you specifically, hoping that you will politely reject it. Sincerely, China, Communications, Jin City, Shanghai, Zhejiang Industrial, all head offices."</p>

<p>According to the National News Agency, the Chinese government and France revised the Annam Trade Treaty, and there are reports that the import coal tax is proposed to be reduced from 2.9 yuan per ton to 0.9 yuan.

The details have been recorded in previous reports. It is now known that the Ministry of Finance has replied to the Coal Merchants' Association in this city. The original telegram is excerpted below: "Addressed to the Shanghai Coal Merchants Association. Your telegram has been received.

<p>The contract and other documents have been signed and submitted to the Public Utilities Bureau for review. It is expected that power transmission between the two parties can be implemented in early August. According to the Dagong News Agency, the Chinese Merchants' Electric Company is responding to the request of the Songjiang Power Plant, and the two parties will implement joint power feeding. The contract and draft electricity tariff have been determined, and the laying of transmission lines will begin next month. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Contract Signed</p>
<p>The Songjiang Power Plant is a business jointly funded by merchants. The internal scale is not large. Nowadays, the residents of the county and townships have gradually become dense. In addition to the increased electricity consumption of shops and households in the urban area, electricity is also supplied to various oil mills and water pumping factories to power machinery. Therefore, the power supply is sometimes insufficient. For this reason, the company has specially contacted the Chinese Merchants' Electric Company in this city to feed electricity for relief. At present, both parties have signed the draft contract and electricity tariff. After the approval of the Municipal Public Utilities Bureau, it can be implemented.</p>
<p>Laying Transmission Lines</p>
<p>The Shanghai-Songjiang power transmission line is currently being planned by the Electrical Engineering Department of the Chinese Merchants' Electric Company. All the materials to be used have also been prepared. The main line starts from the South Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Road, passes through Longhua, Xin Longhua Xinzhuang, and to the Xinqiao section, which is laid by the Chinese Merchants. Starting from Songjiang West Station, passing through Mingxing Bridge to Sijing section, which is built by the Songjiang Power Plant, and a power transmission shed is set up in the middle of the main line, and the number of kilowatt-hours of electricity is recorded by the Chinese Merchants every day, and the accounts are settled once.</p>
<p>Power Feeding Date</p>
<p>According to Zhu Chongxian, director of the General Affairs Department of the Chinese Merchants' Electric Company yesterday, the current power of the company is only for the use of the whole city. This time, Songjiang requested power supply, originally to develop the electrical business in the inland counties and cities and to assist the needs of the rural areas, so we tried our best to contact them. The draft contract has been exchanged and amended by both parties and the laying of the pole line will be carried out next month. It is expected that the power will be turned on in early August.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has issued a notice that it will appropriately reduce the automobile fare from Hangzhou to Mogan due to the Mogan joint ticket on July 1st. The notice states: "Now the Zhejiang Provincial Highway Management Bureau has sent a letter stating that it intends to reduce the first-class one-way automobile fare between Hangzhou and Mogan to 2.4 yuan, the round-trip fare to 4.9 yuan, and the third-class one-way automobile fare to 1.5 yuan from July 1st this year. The round-trip fare is reduced to 2.6 yuan, and the surcharges are all outside. It is also proposed to cancel the full text of item A and the 'B' character in item B of Article 10 of the Joint Transport Regulations. After the price reduction is approved, some restrictions should be made. In addition to agreeing by letter, we hereby order all relevant units to properly correct and sell the original printed fare on the Mogan joint ticket from July 1st with a red pen, and to delete the full text of item A and the character B in item B of Article 10 of the Joint Transport Regulations as necessary."</p>
<h3 id="e139">Insufficient Lung Beds in the Isolation Hospital of the Public Works Bureau <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>The Health Committee of the Public Works Bureau, in view of the increase in the number of out-of-hospital lung patients, and the original lung beds in the Isolation Hospital of the Public Works Bureau are insufficient, specially instructed the Health Department to review whether the lung beds in the hospital can be increased. Now the director of the Health Department has written a report and submitted it to the committee. The report states that the hospital has previously received patients with lung disease who came to the hospital requesting accommodation because of their critical situation and could not refuse them, so they tried to make room for 10 beds specifically for accommodating lung patients. As a result, the hospital's beds are in short supply. When there is an emergency, it is found that it is insufficient to allocate. At present, those admitted to the hospital with lung disease are either in critical condition or severe cases with infectious risks and should not be accommodated together with those in the early stage or mild cases of lung disease. Therefore, the establishment of lung beds in other sanatoriums is not to reduce the burden of the hospital. Since there is no other appropriate place to accommodate them, the isolation hospital is limited by the insufficient number of beds, and the accommodation period for long-term lung disease patients has to be restricted. It is best to set a maximum accommodation period. Although this restriction does not necessarily have to be enforced, it will be beneficial for patients to be transferred to a suitable place. In terms of climate, those with lung disease generally find it more suitable to return to their hometown for rest than to be confined in the hospital. The Health Committee also advocates establishing a maximum accommodation period for lung patients in the Isolation Hospital of the Public Works Bureau. The lack of lung disease treatment facilities in the concession is recorded, and opportunities will be taken to consider it as soon as possible. The Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau held a meeting yesterday and approved the minutes of the committee meeting and filed them.</p>

<p>Yesterday's Meeting</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Merchant Cigarette Industry Association held a business meeting yesterday afternoon.

Various measures were decided upon after the opinions of various committees were expressed. However, due to the confidentiality of the matter, it will not be announced for the time being.</p>
<p>Recommendation to Visit Kong</p>
<p>After the meeting, according to the person in charge of the association, the deadline for banning handmade cigarettes has been handed over to the Tax Bureau.

<p>In order to rectify street cleaning, the Municipal Health Bureau is striving to improve the garbage bins originally placed on the streets. It was first tested in the area under the jurisdiction of the Wenmiao Police Station in the Shanghai South District, and achieved remarkable results. The bureau has jointly adopted the improved garbage disposal method in the Shanghai South and Zhabei districts with the Municipal Public Security Bureau. A few days ago, the Municipal Public Security Bureau ordered various district offices to work with the Shanghai South Health Office to send police to persuade residents, shops, and factories to prepare small garbage bins for indoor use, and all garbage should be dumped into the bins. At the same time, the Health Bureau removed all garbage bins on the streets and sent sanitation workers to ring the bell at each household in the early morning and around 2 pm every day. After hearing the bell, the households immediately dumped the garbage in the small garbage bins into the garbage truck pushed by the sanitation workers. Since the implementation of this improvement measure, the streets have been clean and tidy, and the residents have found it convenient. It will be promoted to the whole city in the future.</p>

They solicited business from Qiu Zi-feng (40 years old) from Wuxi, who lives at No. 7 Xigui Xing Lane, Wuwei Road, Public Concession, and is engaged in the silk business. The fraud was unsuccessful and was reported to the French Concession Police by Qiu. Detective Inspector Jiang Fu-tian, detective Cao Fu-chang, and detective Lu Lu-xian went to Zhengjia Muqiao Street</p>
<p>Dafang Hotel</p>
<p>In room 402, all the above-mentioned people were detained. A newly carved ivory seal and a wooden seal, as well as a newspaper about the customs auctioning human-made silk and a copy of the order form signed by both parties, were found in Huang Shou-ren's pocket. They were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday, they were escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. First, Gu Shou-xi, the lawyer representing the police department, stated the case, saying that the defendant was arrested for the crime of fraud and extortion. The police station still needs to investigate in detail and requested a postponement of two weeks to detain the defendant for detailed investigation before</p>
<p>suing for trial. Then, Jiang Fu-tian, the detective in charge of the case at the police station, reported that the plaintiff was introduced by Li Guo-xian on June 10 and talked to Shen Xing-lu about the sale of 100 boxes of human-made silk that Jianghai Customs had confiscated on the Jinan Maru ship in August last year. On the 17th, Shen accompanied the plaintiff to the Central Bank to meet Huang Shou-ren, who claimed to be the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance. At that time, the price of each box was set at 250 yuan, and 15,000 yuan in cash must be paid first before delivery. An order was scheduled to be placed on the 21st. In fact, there was no such goods at all. The whole plan was designed to defraud. The plaintiff was afraid of being deceived, so he inquired with the Jianghai Customs Tax Department and learned that the goods had already been</p>
<p>advertised for auction, which was indeed a scam. It was also found that Huang Shou-ren was not the Secretary-General of the Ministry of Finance. Therefore, the Customs Anti-Smuggling Section reported to the Water Patrol Police, which was forwarded to the French Concession Police. On the one hand, the plaintiff was ordered to falsely invite Huang Shou-ren and others to open a room at the Dafang Hotel to place an order, with Shen Xing-lu acting as the frontman, Huang Shou-ren as the guarantor, and Lin and Le as witnesses. The detectives waited, and when they were about to pay the money after writing the receipt and order form, the detectives entered the room and arrested the defendants. The receipt, order form, and other evidence were presented to the court. In addition, the plaintiff Qiu Zi-feng filed a complaint about the previous situation, which was the same as what Inspector Jiang said. He also said that the merchant and his younger brother Yu Jia had been subjected to the same plan last year and had been defrauded of</p>
<p>tens of thousands of dollars. When these people came, they were all dressed in Western suits and were very generous. After being defrauded, they disappeared. This time, the merchant inquired with the provincial office and learned the details, etc. Huang Shou-ren confessed that he was a staff member in the Ministry of Finance, not the Secretary-General. This time, he was indeed deceived by others and hesitated. Shen Xing-lu confessed that he was introduced to Huang Shou-ren by Lin Ze-yuan and only knew that Huang was a first-class staff member of the Ministry of Finance. Li Guo-xian introduced the Qiu family to Huang Shou-ren and Lin Ze-yuan to sell customs goods and asked me to come forward to place an order. Lin Ze-yuan confessed that he had known Huang Shou-ren for many years and Shen Xing-lu for only a year. Huang said that in August last year, the customs had a Jinan Maru</p>
<p>confiscated 100 boxes of tax-evading human-made silk. After the detention, a Japanese named Oda asked Huang to intercede with the Tax Department and ordered a penalty. Because the Japanese was unable to pay the penalty, the goods were still in customs and were to be sold. Therefore, he introduced them. He did not know that there was no such goods. The remaining words were vague. Le Xin-zhang confessed that he was a tailor and that they had asked him to go to the Dafang Hotel to be a witness on the order form. He did not know about the fraud. The witness Li Guo-xian confessed that he was from Guangdong and was formerly the Deputy Manager of Shen Yu Xing. Shen Xing-lu came to ask if I had customs human-made silk to buy. Dang knew the situation. After Qiu Huan-ying pushed and brought the confession, the court ordered a postponement of the trial to 10 am on July 10. The defendants were remanded.</p>
<p>Xinghua Ship Damaged Propeller Teeth</p>
<p>The Xinghua ship of the Xinglun Ship Company in this port, which travels between Shanghai and Beiyang, touched the bottom of the ship near the Tianjin Railway Pier this time, causing the propeller teeth on the engine to be damaged. It needs to be repaired now. The captain has not reported the details, so I do not know the details yet.</p>
<h3 id="e150">The Whole City's Pawn Industry Appeals to Shorten the Maturity Period of Pawned Goods Businesses are Closing Down One After Another Due to the Impact of Soaring Prices If We Do Not Save Them, the Whole Body Will Collapse in Less Than Two Years Presenting to the Social Bureau for Approval to Change the Maturity Period to One Year <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>According to Datong News Agency, the Shanghai Pawn Industry Association submitted a document to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau yesterday, requesting to shorten the maturity period of pawned goods in order to provide relief. The original document is copied below: It is for the matter of submitting a request. I respectfully belong to the association</p>
<p>The entire industry in the city is under the shadow of the current economic downturn. Businesses that cannot maintain operations due to unbearable losses are closing down one after another. The reason for the losses is due to the sluggish business and the sharp reduction in income. However, the selling price of full goods is only 60% of the pawned capital, which is the biggest fatal injury. For example, the average value of full goods pawned each year is 10,000 yuan. The selling price is only 12,000 yuan, which means a loss of 8,000 yuan. In addition, the expenses are insufficient, and the annual consumption exceeds 10,000 yuan. Relying entirely on the meager interest income, how can we make up for the loss and maintain the business? If this continues, if we do not</p>
<p>seek to save it urgently, the whole body will collapse and all businesses will close down in less than a year. The pawn industry, which is the lifeblood of the economic turnover of ordinary people, has this hidden anxiety in its future, and its impact on social people's livelihood is enormous. The association has realized this and submitted a request to your bureau on July 14 last year, requesting approval to shorten the maturity period of pawned goods to 12 months. Later, it was approved that the case was forwarded to the municipal government for review, which led to its indefinite shelving. Now, the bleak situation of the industry is becoming more and more dangerous. It is even more urgent to find ways to remedy it. Therefore, we dare to reiterate the previous request, hoping to benefit the late years. According to the maturity period of half a year in those years, the market was stable,</p>
<p>The secret of balanced prices has no relation. Today, financial resources are exhausted and prices are soaring. The pawned goods are still stored for a long time according to the rules. One day, the pawners abandon them and do not buy them. The clothes, which account for the majority of full goods, have become outdated due to changes in styles and are no longer considered. In addition, the price of raw materials is lower than the pawned capital. How can we seek not to suffer losses and sell them? Moreover, according to the statistics of the industry's redemption volume, less than one in ten people redeem after more than ten months. This proves that the preservation after ten months is a burden for pawn shops.</p>
<p>Capital is stuck in turnover and interest is charged. When selling, it suffers even greater losses. For the pawners, it is of no benefit. Not only is it not practical for both parties, but it is also a waste of resources. Therefore, shortening the maturity period is the key to the current relief of the pawn industry, and it cannot be delayed. Therefore, we dare to not be afraid of the cost of words, and express the situation in detail. We humbly request the hook bureau to forward it to the municipal government and quickly approve the previous case in order to relieve the difficulties of the merchants and benefit the people's livelihood. We are sincerely waiting for orders. We respectfully present to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Pretending to be a Doctor and Recruiting Obstetrics Students Xu Gong-huan Arrested Female Students Demand Return of Tuition Police Department Sues for Fraud <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Xu Gong-huan from Wenzhou, also known as Xu Han-min, 25 years old, did not obtain a doctor's qualification, but pretended to be a doctor. On April this year, he opened Jianmin Obstetrics Hospital at No. 184 to 186, the corner of North Zhejiang Road and Qipai Road, opposite the First Special District Court. He hired Jiang Tian-shi as the director and published advertisements to recruit obstetrics students. From April 18 to May 9, Yao Bing-yan, a female from Suzhou, and Sun Yan, a local, Zhu Yu-quan from Pudong, and Li Yi-guang from Guizhou (who came from Guizhou) came to the hospital to study obstetrics. The tuition fees paid were 50 yuan for Yao, 56 yuan each for Sun and Zhu, and 60 yuan for Li. After entering the hospital, Yao and others immediately discovered that the hospital's equipment was rudimentary and that Xu was not a doctor but was prescribing medicine, which made people suspicious. They asked Xu to return the tuition fees and prepared to withdraw from school. Except for Li Yi-guang, who got 9 yuan back, the rest did not get a penny. Yao and others reported to the Huizi Police Station, and detectives arrested Xu the day before yesterday. Yesterday, he was escorted to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Li Zhi-shan, the lawyer of the police station, stated the case and filed a lawsuit for fraud under Article 363 of the Criminal Law. Because it still needs to be investigated, he requested a postponement. Then Yao and others stated the process of being deceived, and that after Xu was arrested, Xu's concubine refused to allow us to live in the hospital, so we had no place to go. They asked the court to provide relief. Xu Gong-huan confessed that he was not a doctor. Judge Ye Sheng-chao verified the confession and ordered the case to be postponed for trial. He also ordered the police station to send detectives to accompany Yao Bing-yan and others to Jianmin Hospital to take out their luggage before making a decision.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Zhang Da-min Appeals Against Tang Ji-shan The Trial Was Held in the Third Branch of the High Court Yesterday The Court Debate Ended and a Judgment Date Was Set <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Da-min from Guangdong, who used to live with the deceased movie star and fellow villager Ruan Ling-yu, separated in April of the twelfth year. In the winter of last year, Zhang suddenly hired a teacher to act as his agent and filed a criminal lawsuit against Ruan in the Second Special District Court for crimes such as forging documents and embezzlement. At the same time, he also sued Ruan and Tang Ji-shan, who later lived with her, for adultery and seduction of the girl Miao-rong, disrupting the family, causing Ruan Ling-yu to be too stimulated and commit suicide by poisoning on April 8 this year. The case is still proceeding according to law. After the trial by Judge Jing Zhao of the Second Special District Court, Tang Ji-shan was found not guilty, and Ruan Ling-yu's part was not accepted. Zhang Da-min expressed dissatisfaction with this judgment and filed an appeal with the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. This newspaper has already recorded the details. Yesterday morning was the date for the collegial panel of the Third Branch of the High Court to hear the case. The appellant Zhang Da-min and his brother and agent lawyer arrived at the court at 10 am</p>
<p>to report. The appellant Tang Ji-shan also arrived at the court at that time with Ruan's mother He and several daughters and the defense lawyer Jiang Yi-ping to report. Both parties were dressed in Western suits and sat quietly in the lawyers' rest room waiting for the trial, speechless. At 11 am, Guo De-zhang, the head of the criminal court, accompanied by judges Pei-en and Wang Yue, prosecutor Zhang Zong-ru, clerk Wu Jia-yu, and others, specially opened the third criminal court for trial. The court clerk summoned Zhang and Tang and the lawyers of both parties to the case. After the official questioned both parties about their age, occupation, and address, he sent a copy of Zhang Da-min's appeal reason to the court and handed it to Tang Ji-shan for receipt. The official asked Zhang Da-min about the reasons for the appeal against the original judgment. According to Zhang Da-min, the fact is that Ruan Ling-yu and I are indeed</p>
<p>Husband and wife, Tang Ji-shan disrupted my family. That year, after I returned to Shanghai from Fujian, Tang had already moved my wife and daughter away. In fact, Tang committed the crime of adultery. On the morning of April 12, 1933, I went to Ruan Ling-yu's house at No. 1 Dasheng Hutong and saw Tang Ji-shan in the room with my wife Ruan Ling-yu. I asked, haven't you and Ruan Ling-yu signed a separation agreement? He replied, that's right. Later, Ruan came to the China Hotel and asked me to sign. I asked, the agreement between you and Ruan clearly states that it was a love affair and cohabitation relationship. He replied, it was not cohabitation, but living together. This is a mistake. I asked, do you have a contract? He replied, I have lost it. At this time, Tang Ji-shan presented the separation agreement between Zhang and Ruan to the court. After reading it, the court asked Zhang to read it. After Zhang read it, he asked, the two words at the beginning of the second line of this agreement,</p>
<p>is concubinage, why do you say that you and Ruan are officially married? What evidence can you provide to prove it? He replied, there are photos of the marriage and my brother is also here today to testify. After speaking, Zhang presented a photo of himself, Ruan, and his brother and sister-in-law to the court. The court asked, how can this prove that they are officially married? He replied, after my mother died on February 15, 1927, we got married that day according to custom. The court asked, when did you get engaged to Ruan Ling-yu? He replied, in August of the fifteenth year. The court asked, what evidence is there? He replied, my brother can testify. The court asked, when did you separate from Ruan Ling-yu? He replied, in March of the eleventh year, when I went to Fujian. Then, regarding the girl Miao-rong, Zhang presented the registration form for Miao-rong's enrollment in the Affiliated Elementary School of Zhi Ren Yong Girls' School for inspection. The court asked, who is Zhang Da-wen on this form? He replied, it's me.</p>
<p>Miao-rong wrote the word "Min" in my name as "Wen". At this point, the court questioned the respondent Tang Ji-shan, whether he heard what Zhang Da-min said clearly, and whether he had an affair with Ruan Ling-yu in the twenty-first year because Zhang left Shanghai. He replied that he only met Ruan Ling-yu at a dinner hosted by Lianhua Company in the winter of the twenty-first year. Zhang Da-min only met him once at the last court hearing, and today is the second time he has met. He only started living with Ruan in August of the twenty-first year. The court asked, did you know that Ruan was Zhang Da-min's wife? He replied, I didn't know, and Ruan didn't tell me. The court asked, does Ruan have a daughter? He replied, yes, her name is Xiao-yu, I don't know if she has other names. She is now being raised by Ruan's mother, and I live with Ruan's mother in two places. The court asked, Xiao-yu was raised by Zhang since she was a child, why do you want</p>
<p>hide her? He replied, I didn't hide her. At this point, the court summoned Ruan's mother, Ruan He, to the court. According to her, she is 50 years old, a middleman, and now lives at No. 100 Yu Fang, North Sichuan Road. She knows Tang and Zhang. Ling-yu is my biological daughter. She lived with Zhang in the five-year and two-month period, and until the war broke out in the twenty-first year, I transferred the house at No. 21, Section 159, and moved to Wenyuanfang, Laoer Dong Road. Later, in the twenty-second year, I moved to No. 1 Dasheng Hutong. Because Zhang did not take care of the family and often beat Ling-yu, my daughter separated from Zhang. In August of that year, Ling-yu had a relationship with Tang Ji-shan. Miao-rong was raised by me. At that time, I was still living on Baoshan Road. Miao-rong's original name was Du,</p>
<p>Her mother worked as a helper and her father made boats for a living. Today, the child is sick at home, so she did not come to court. Now, all my household expenses are paid by Tang at 120 yuan per month, etc., etc. The court then asked Zhang, did you hear what Ruan He said? He replied, that's not right. He said that I didn't take care of the family. At that time, I sent 300 yuan to them from Hong Kong. Besides, I wasn't in Shanghai, how could I beat his daughter? No. 1 Dasheng Hutong is where Ruan and Tang lived together. Please ask him when he started living with Ruan. The court asked, what number do you live in Dasheng Hutong? He replied, No. 23. At this point, it was almost noon. The court then ordered the lawyers of both parties to start the debate, and then announced the adjournment and set the judgment date for 2 pm on the 29th.</p>

<p>Bao Xian-fa, a freight runner for Xiangmao Foreign Firm from Yin County, had an affair with Shen Si, a woman from the same hometown, until 1932. After Shen gave birth to a daughter, the relationship between the two suddenly deteriorated. In the winter of that year, Bao gave some money and they separated. The daughter born to Shen was taken away and raised. It has been four years since then. Until last month, the woman suddenly filed a criminal lawsuit of abandonment against Bao in the District Court of the First Special Zone. On the day of the court record, Bao submitted the separation agreement established at the beginning. The investigation showed that the agreement was written at Daguan Garden on Er Ma Road. After Shen signed it, he gave her 250 yuan. Xu Jin-fang. Zhang Lian-bao was the mediator on the scene, and Xu and Zhang went to court to prove that the fact of separation was indeed established. Therefore, the initial trial of the case was concluded, and Shen Sibao's lawsuit was rejected, and Shen denied that there was any agreement. Bao, Xu, and Zhang colluded to forge the agreement, so he hired a lawyer to sue the three for forgery in the First Special Court. After Wu, Judge Yang Fu tried the case. According to Shen Sibao, she only caught a glimpse of the agreement when another case was heard on May 25, but she never signed an agreement with Bao. As for the 250 yuan given by Bao, it was for living expenses after giving birth to a daughter. Because Xu's business was written by Bao and Zhang was a tea servant, they all listened to Bao's orders, etc. Bao, Xu, Zhang, and other three defendants firmly stated that the words in the agreement were indeed signed by the plaintiff. Judge Yang Xuan ordered the trial to be postponed to the afternoon of July 3.</p>
<h3 id="e154">Daughter of a Fishmonger Induced to Abortion After Being Seduced by Cao Yilang; Old Woman and Cai Yuzhang Flee; Cao Yilang and Friends Arrested <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>Jiang Maolang, a Chongming native residing at No. 4, Lane 447, Yucai Road, Yangshupu, makes a living selling fish. His daughter, Xiaoqing, is only seventeen years old and already feeling the needs of womanhood. A certain bachelor, seeing her weakness, pursued her. Cao Yilang, from Haimen, got there first. On January 4th of this year, he fulfilled his dreams at a local inn. Unexpectedly, after Cao's advances, Xiaoqing's period never came. However, Cao was engaged and formally married this spring. After his wedding, he forgot his past affections. When he occasionally encountered Xiaoqing, he treated her like a stranger. Xiaoqing felt both ashamed and resentful. Moreover, her belly was gradually swelling, and she feared her father's discovery. She repeatedly sought Cao to negotiate a resolution. When this failed, she threatened mutual destruction. Cao, concerned about escalating the situation, consulted with his friend Yang Xuefan from Tongzhou. Yang introduced him to Ding Laoming, a fellow townsman, for advice. Ding then introduced Cao to Cai Yuzhang, an experienced man. Cai readily agreed to help devise a plan to completely eliminate the "piece of meat" in her womb. The only solution was an abortion. Therefore, he entrusted an old woman who specialized in abortions. On the morning of the 9th of this month, she went to Xiaoqing's home. Taking advantage of Maolang being at the market selling fish, she hastily performed the procedure. Although the fetus was immediately aborted, Xiaoqing's life was in danger. The old woman was unskilled in aftercare and unable to restore her to health quickly. Maolang eventually learned of this, sending his daughter to the nearby Sacred Heart Hospital for treatment. He reported Cao's disregard for human life to the local police station, requesting that detectives Liu Ketian and Liu Zhisheng investigate. Except for Cai Yuzhang and the old woman, who fled, Cao, Yang, and Ding were arrested and sent to the First Special District Court, charged with aiding and abetting abortion under Article 305 of the criminal code. Because Jiang Xiaoqing was still hospitalized, the judge ordered the three defendants to be detained pending further investigation. Until the day before yesterday, the local police station reported that Xiaoqing had recovered. The police chief ordered the detectives to arrest Xiaoqing and send her to the female detention center. Yesterday morning, she was taken to the Criminal Court, where lawyer Li Zhishan, representing the police station, charged Xiaoqing with</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>hiding the pregnancy, seeking punishment under Article 304, Section 2 of the criminal code. Lawyer Li requested that the case be combined with the case against Cao Yilang. Judge Ye granted the request, ordering Jiang Xiaoqing to be released to her father, Jiang Maolang, pending a combined hearing. However, the police discovered that Cao Yilang was guilty of having intercourse with Xiaoqing when she was under the legal age of sixteen. He will also face a charge of rape under Article 240 of the criminal code.</p>
<h3 id="e155">Fake Currency Case Awaiting Sentencing <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Chief Detective Zhang Defu and Detective Zhang of the Hongkou Police Station previously cracked a fake currency sales operation on the upper floor of No. 93, Lane 59-, Burton Road. They arrested Chen Xiaosan from Tongzhou, Huang Shiliang from Pudong, and Wang Rongguang from Fujian, seizing a rattan basket containing 6,743 one-yuan notes from the Bank of China. They were sent to the First Special District Court for multiple interrogations and detentions, as previously reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Wu Zehan conducted a further hearing in the Third Criminal Court. Lawyer Wang of the Municipal Council stated that no other cases were pending after the adjournment, and that shareholders such as Zhang Xifang and Lin Si were still at large. Zhang resided at a certain address on Xilin Liu Road in the Chinese area. Detectives and officers from the local Public Security Bureau went to the address to arrest him but found that he had already fled, having heard the news. However, two portraits were found, one kept by the Public Security Bureau and the other taken by the police station to be presented. Chen Xiaosan was accused of selling counterfeit currency, while Huang Shiliang and Wang Rongguang were accused of manufacturing counterfeit currency. The prosecution requested severe punishment according to the law. Chen Xiaosan insisted that he was invited by Lin Si, and that he did not know how many shareholders there were. Lin Si gave him a total of 4,000 notes in the Jiangnan and Aido Road hotels on two occasions. He sold over a thousand notes at a certain location on Qiujiang Road, priced at ten yuan per hundred, deducting one yuan for commission. The rest he hesitated to provide. The testimonies of Huang and Wang were similar to their previous statements, claiming that they were deceived by Lin Si and a Mr. Gu to work. Judge Wu ordered them to be detained, scheduling a sentencing date.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Customs Brokers Pay Donations According to Public Contracts; Citizen's Association Asks Municipal Council to Exempt Them; Nature is Like Third-Level Tenants, Different from Apartments <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Municipal Council imposed apartment donations on customs brokers within the concession and suddenly cut off water and electricity. The Second Special District Citizen's Association felt that this action was excessively oppressive and sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting consideration of the merchants' difficulties and cessation of payments. The original letter is recorded below. "To Whom It May Concern, according to a presentation from the Second District Branch of this Association: 'Recently, we received a letter from the Customs Broker Association stating that members like Zhengda, Taikoo Chang, Xingtai Chang, Litai Chang, and Tongju Jiang, and other customs brokers claimed that the French Municipal Council mistakenly thought that we were running apartments. After ordering us to pay this donation in November of last year, the matter was resolved after repeated negotiations. However, the Municipal Council brought up the old matter again after half a year, cutting off the electricity lines of Customs Brokers such as Litai Chang, Zhengda, and Taikoo Chang in May. At a time when the market is so depressed, our colleagues are struggling to make a living. The Municipal Council has made unexpected demands, causing trouble and harming the citizens' peace and order. We are also citizens and ask your association to transfer a letter to the Citizen's Association, seeking their assistance in upholding justice and striving for the Municipal Council on reasonable grounds to stabilize the business.' Accordingly, after investigating that the customs brokers sublet the remaining houses and goods to out-of-town offices in Shanghai, their nature is no different from that of second or third-level tenants, and they are absolutely different from public houses, so there is no reason to pay donations. Moreover, business is so sluggish that it is difficult to solve life's problems, so how can such an unexpected burden be added? As for water and electricity, which are related to the lives of the people, the Municipal Council suddenly cut them off, which is tantamount to putting our citizens to death. Your association is the leader of the citizens and has always been committed to protecting legal rights. It is appropriate to send a letter according to the circumstances, and humbly ask you to uphold justice, help as much as possible, strive for reason, maintain the market and protect public security. In light of this, we have prepared a letter for your perusal, and hope that you will investigate." Therefore, after investigating that the customs brokers sublet the remaining houses and goods to out-of-town offices in Shanghai, completely for business convenience, their nature is indeed different from that of apartments. Now, your bureau wants to collect donations based on apartments, and suddenly cut off water and electricity. This kind of action is excessively oppressive. According to the previous letter, it is appropriate to send a letter to you, hoping that you will consider the difficulties of business, stop the donation, and immediately restore electricity to maintain business and friendship. To the Municipal Council."</p>

<p>According to Xin Sheng News Agency, Sanbei Steamship Company in this port owns over thirty ships and is the largest Chinese steamship company. Recently, Deputy Manager Li Zhiyi advocated tightening up and laying off workers. Ship crews were laid off from ships such as Xing Shi, Jing'an, Qingpu, and Pu. Shi Zhiguan, a member of the freight department of the Jing'an ship, who was recently laid off, was a thirty-year-old Ningbo native residing in Laiyi Ferry, Pudong. He served on the ship, and his meager salary was barely enough to support his family. Now that he has been laid off and unemployed, he feels that his livelihood has become hopeless and has had thoughts of ending his life. On the day before yesterday, he secretly swallowed raw opium at home and committed suicide. When his family discovered it, it was too late to save him. He died instantly. Alas, how tragic!</p>

<p>Yu Shamen, a Ningbo native residing at No. 4, Chongqing Dongli, Fangxie Road, Nanshi, a former detective with the Public Security Bureau Detective Team, cherished his daughter. Yesterday morning around 10:00, while carrying his younger sister in his arms, she was playing in front of the Baiyun Temple on Xilin Hou Road nearby. Suddenly, a local robber wearing a blue cloth short shirt and pants jumped out of the road, snatched the gold jewelry (gold wooden fish) from the girl's hand and ran away with the loot in the direction of Fangxie Road to escape. The girl, Aizhu, noticed and shouted for help, chasing after him desperately. Pedestrians nearby blew police whistles to help with the pursuit, resulting in the capture by Police Fan Weigang of Post No. 15 of the Ximen Branch. The stolen goods were found on the thief, and both the witness and the thief were taken to the police station for legal action.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Two Organizations Send a Large Number of Refugees; Fundraising from All Sectors <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, Wang Ting, Qu Wenliu, Huang Hanzhi, and other directors of the Shanghai Charity Organization Federation and the Shanghai Xinwei Relief Society stated that the drought disasters in various provinces last year were severe, causing rural bankruptcy, industrial and commercial decline, unemployed poor people, and refugees from various provinces and counties flocked to Shanghai. They gathered in front of the association's headquarters, crying and begging for relief, which was pitiful. Those in this city mostly begged for food rations, while those from other provinces requested boat tickets and travel expenses to return to their hometowns. The two associations' staff conducted detailed investigations and handled the matters separately. However, since the January 28th incident in this city, the market has been declining, and fundraising is difficult. The previous relief efforts required a lot of money, which was difficult to meet. Therefore, they recently sent letters to various charities in this city to raise funds for relief. According to the staff of the two associations, Ge Yunxun, Chen Youtang, Zhang Zixin, and Wang Yisun, the statistics for the number of refugees sent back to their hometowns in various provinces are as follows: From May 11th to the 14th of this month, boat tickets were issued to 1,280 people from Wuhu, Anhui, 197 people from Anqing, 69 people from Jiujiang, 309 people from Nanjing, 213 people from Datong, 50 people from Zhenjiang, 5 people from Kouan, 209 people from Hankou, 12 people from Ningbo, 38 people from Tianjin, and 6 people from Fujian, totaling 1,408 people. They were all escorted back to their hometowns in batches by the China Merchants Bureau and the Sanbei Company's Yangtze River ships. The cost of food for the ships reached over 3,000 yuan. It is difficult to raise funds for the two associations. It is hoped that charitable organizations and enthusiastic philanthropists from all walks of life will donate generously to provide relief, which will be a great merit.</p>

<p>The Shenshi News Agency reports that Shen Xiyuan, a cashier at the Huizhong Inn in Suzhou, had an affair with a woman named Liu Caizhen (Cuizhen) and had a son. Liu repeatedly asked Shen to divorce his original wife. They were married in Suzhou on the 19th of this month, but he suddenly disappeared. Shen was found committing suicide by eating raw opium in the Shijia Hotel in Mudu. Liu was at her sister's place, and her brother-in-law is Tan Zhonghui, the head of the Secretariat of the Central Bank. A reporter from the Shenshi News Agency visited Secretary Tan of the Central Bank yesterday to inquire about the matter. According to Tan, the incident occurred in Suzhou, and he did not know the details. His wife and her sister Cuizhen rarely met. The report that she was at her sister's place was obviously not true. Moreover, the sisters had severed their relationship long ago. Lawyer Fei Tinghuang represented them in publishing a statement in various newspapers in Suzhou severing their sisterly relationship, so there was no dispute. Secretary Tan showed the lawyer's notice published in various Suzhou newspapers, representing Liu Suzhen, Tan's wife, severing the relationship with her sister Cuizhen, stating that Liu Suzhen and Cuizhen were both daughters of Liu Yu. Recently, due to differences of opinion between the two, Suzhen wished to sever her sisterly relationship with Cuizhen, and Cuizhen also agreed, with the permission of their mother Yu. A written agreement was signed by both parties on the spot, and lawyer Fei was invited to certify it. Fearing that friends and relatives might not know, we entrusted a representative to publish a statement in the newspaper. The address of the firm is No. 47, Taipingmen Lane, Suzhou, phone number 558.</p>

In fact, the Canadian head office still remits funds to China for investment every year.</p>

<p>To Whom It May Concern: After checking the local news on page 12 of your newspaper's third edition, in the proposal of the establishment meeting of the Straw Hat Export Industry Association, the discussion of the charter, and the resolution, the cancellation of vendors was mistakenly printed as the cancellation of transportation, and the seven executive committee members were mistakenly printed as nine executive committee members. Please correct the letter accordingly and publish it in the "Incoming Letters" column. To the Editor-in-Chief of Shenbao, the Preparatory Office of the Shanghai Transportation and Export Straw Hat Industry Association, June 25th. After reading your newspaper's news column yesterday, it mentioned that the Wan Guo Theatre would perform "Red Lie Ma" at the Carlton Theatre and included our group's national music program, which was surprising. One month ago, when the play was being rehearsed, the theatre contacted our group once, but our group did not agree to participate because members were leaving Shanghai during the performance. After reading your newspaper's announcement of the theatre's performance yesterday, which included our group's program, it must have been a misunderstanding of hearsay. Our group did not dare to take credit, so we sent this special letter to correct it. To the Editor of Shenbao, Sincerely, the _ Orchestra, June 25th, evening. Thanks for the courtesy of the Bank Weekly for sending a copy of the 905th issue, thank you.</p>

<p>Fei Xinfu, a Ningbo native and owner of the Cheng Yu Cotton Fabric Store at No. 10, Lane 179, Tianjin Road, was recently sued in the First Special District Court by Zhou Li, a Ningbo woman residing at No. 4, Fengrui Lane, Beihai Road, Baker Road, along with her daughter Zhou Suzhen, on charges of endangering public morality. The facts alleged that Yu Meitian, a friend of Zhou Li's husband, was acquainted with Fei. Because of this, Fei became acquainted with Zhou Suzhen and, through Fei's enticement, sexually assaulted her at the New East Hotel in early February of this year. Subsequently, he took her as a concubine, renting a room above the Xiechang New Tobacco Company on Wuzhen Road where they cohabited for two months, after which he disappeared without a trace. Zhou Li sued Fei for rape under Article 140 of the Criminal Code, as her daughter had not reached the legal age. Fei also filed a countersuit, claiming that Zhou Li was a well-known prostitute from Ningbo named Zhilan Abao, and that her two younger sisters, Wenying and Wenlan, were also involved in the sex trade, as was her daughter Zhou Suzhen. Initially, she resided in Room 6 of the Qunyi Hotel. In March, it was rumored that she had moved to Room 225 of the Yingbao Hotel to solicit clients. Fei, through Yu Meitian's introduction, had visited her there. The house on Wuzhen Road was also rented by Zhou Li under the name of Li Wenkui, inviting Fei to come. Fei, due to a lack of funds, refused to go, angering Zhou Li, who demanded 300 yuan from Fei, and upon failing to obtain it, filed a lawsuit, requesting that he be prosecuted for fraud. This case was heard yesterday at 3:00 PM by Judge Wu Zehan of the First Special District Court in the Second Criminal Court. By 3:30 PM, Zhou Li and Zhou Suzhen had not yet reported. Judge Wu ruled that since the plaintiff had been lawfully summoned and had failed to appear without reason, the case should be considered withdrawn. He also advised the defendant's side to withdraw the countersuit as well. Yuan Zhi, the defendant's lawyer, agreed, and Judge Wu ruled that the case was not accepted.</p>
<p>In another case, a woman named Wang Xiuying recently filed a complaint with the First Special District Court, through lawyer Wen Chao, against Xu Hanchen, a senior staff member in the Western Medicine Department of the Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. at No. 110, Sichuan Road, on charges of abandonment and injury. Judge Zhan Liangce accepted the case and scheduled a hearing for 2:30 PM yesterday in the Fifth Criminal Court. Both parties' summonses had been lawfully served, but as of 3:05 PM yesterday, neither party had appeared. Judge Zhan, in accordance with the provisions of the Criminal Procedure Law, declared that the case was not accepted, and the plaintiff's attached civil suit was dismissed.</p>

<h3 id="e180">Suzhou Women's Normal School Dismisses Principal Due to Exam Boycott; Education Department Orders Early Holiday Immediately <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The entire student body of the Provincial Suzhou Women's Normal School, in opposition to Principal Chen Shu, launched a wave of dismissal agitation. The details of the incident have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. The Education Department sent Secretary Huang, Section Chief Xiang, and Section Member Xue to Suzhou to investigate. The investigation results were reported to the Education Department and filed on record. On the 24th, Secretary Huang went to the school to supervise the examination, but the entire student body boycotted the examination because the goal of dismissing the principal had not been achieved. Secretary Huang immediately telegraphed the province for instructions. That afternoon, a reply from Director Zhou was received, instructing five urgent handling measures: (1) Expel ten students who were found to be ringleaders and coerced their classmates; (2) Start the holiday early from today, and carefully inform each parent to take their students home. No food or accommodation will be provided from the 26th onward; (3) Students who were coerced and blindly followed will be allowed to reform themselves; (4) Those who incited the disturbance will be specifically reported for investigation; (5) Principal Chen Shu is known to be strict with discipline and has excellent performance, so she should diligently manage affairs and not be discouraged. After receiving the telegram, Secretary Huang, accompanied by the Wu County Magistrate, led police to the school and ordered the students to take the examination according to the law. However, no one took the examination. Therefore, students Wu Wenzao (president of the student government), Jian Xiuying, Qian Xiufang (vice president), Sun De, Zhu Guangxi, Ding Ruifen, Zhu Yueying, Xu Wanling, Yao Tongzhu, Chu Jiayuan, and Zhang Lǜxi were expelled. On the morning of yesterday (the 25th), Secretary Huang, in accordance with the instructions of the Education Department, announced the early holiday. Therefore, local students returned home separately that day, and other out-of-town students are also preparing to return home. Secretary Huang, together with Principal Chen, are carefully identifying the coerced students in order to report to the Education Department and request instructions for rectification.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 19th) Director of the Hubei Education Department Cheng Qibao reported to the Ministry of Education on the educational situation in Hubei Province and requested instructions on the direction of progress. After completing his business, he returned to Wuhan by China National Aviation Corporation plane on the morning of the 25th.</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang, 25th) The Provincial Government decided on the 25th to appoint Yang Cui as the principal of Nantong Middle School, Qin Man as the director of the Danyang County Education Bureau, Chen Yue as the director of the Changshu Education Bureau, and Gao Hongkui as the director of the Wujiang Education Bureau.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Liu Jihong Heads Henan University <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>(Kaifeng, 25th) The provincial government granted Yang Zhenwen, the president of Henan University, a leave of absence for recuperation on the 24th, and appointed Liu Jihong as acting president, ordering Yang to expedite the handover. Furthermore, a telegram stated that the newly appointed president of Henan University, Liu Jihong, arrived at the school on the 25th to assume his duties.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Ministry of Education Instruction: Improve Lingnan University (Private) <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>On the 25th, the Ministry of Education issued an instruction to Lingnan University (Private), stating in brief, "The school has been inspected by personnel and reports have been submitted. After review, the school's allocation of funds is able to focus on equipment, and most teachers are full-time and diligent in their duties. Teaching practice is also considered genuine, and research work is able to focus on practical issues. The achievements of the sericulture department in the study of sericulture and the biology department in the collection of plant and insect specimens are particularly commendable. However, the following points still need to be improved: 1. The school's funding is already difficult, and it is insufficient to manage the current scale. The number of students in each department is also not large. The school should reduce its scope, enrich its content, and if there is a need to establish a home economics or fine arts department, change it to a specialized course. The names of the social science departments are too broad and should be corrected according to their actual scope. The pre-medical department has already been ordered to be abolished by the Ministry and should be closed immediately. The school should submit a plan to reduce each department within June for approval. 2. The various regulations established by the school, such as the organizational outline and school rules, are not in line with the University Organization Law, the University Regulations, and various educational laws. They should be revised and submitted to the Ministry for approval and implementation. The position of consultant is not based on the University Organization Law and should be abolished immediately. Important officials within the school should be appointed with Chinese scholars. The classification and naming of faculty should also be revised. 3. The name and methods of the graduate research institute established by the school are not fully in line with the Provisional Organizational Regulations for University Graduate Institutes promulgated by the Ministry last year. If the school needs to establish research institutes, it should follow the above-mentioned regulations and formulate a plan based on the school's faculty, equipment, and funding situation and submit it to the Ministry for approval. Before being approved, the school may not recruit graduate students or award advanced degrees. 4. The school lacks a foundation and relies heavily on tuition fees for its recurring expenses, which is not a sustainable plan. The school board should raise funds to increase revenue. The student fees are too numerous and the amounts are too high, and they should be reduced. The school's established joint school system, which provides exemptions from entrance examinations for graduates of joint schools, is inappropriate and should be abolished immediately to prevent abuse. 5. The school lacks active measures for moral education, and student attire is particularly extravagant. The moral education committee should be responsible for strictly formulating methods to correct this. It is hereby ordered that you strictly follow these instructions and report the results accordingly."</p>

<p>Yesterday was the second day of the graduation joint examination for secondary schools and physical education normal schools in this city. The order in the examination halls remained good. Today is the last day. From 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM, high school, junior high school, and physical education normal school students will take Chinese.

<h3 id="e185">The Public Works Department's Financial Difficulties Affect Education and Construction in the Concession <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department has recently felt financially constrained, making it difficult to proceed with educational facilities within the concession. For example, the Western Girls' Public School on Yuyuan Road urgently needs a home science building, and the Western Primary School in the neighborhood also requires an assembly hall. However, due to lack of funds, both projects have had to be temporarily shelved. The construction costs for these two projects are estimated at 35,000 yuan for the former and 25,000 yuan for the latter, both of which have been included in this year's budget. However, due to financial constraints, they have had to be postponed along with other new constructions already included in the budget. However, during a previous Public Works Department board meeting, the Director-General stated that the construction of the Western Primary School assembly hall was originally planned as part of the existing building, but has been delayed until now due to economic reasons. He also noted that the construction of the Girls' Public School's home science building is particularly necessary, as the school originally had a building with home economics and cooking classes. However, the building was demolished as it obstructed the construction of the neighboring Western Primary School. Therefore, it is now urgent to rebuild it to meet immediate needs. This is an important part of restoring the school's original building, and should not be compared to newly added constructions like the Western Primary School's assembly hall. The Education Department is also willing to continue its efforts to promote the matter, so that construction can begin as soon as funds become available. However, given the current situation, it is feared that this will be difficult to achieve in the short term.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Public Works Department Stipulates Use of Subsidies for Chinese Schools in the Concession <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>The Public Works Department's Education Department recently raised the issue of how subsidies for various private Chinese schools are used for discussion at the board meeting. According to the Education Department, some schools have used the subsidies to reduce or waive tuition fees for students with excellent academic performance and conduct who come from poor families. While this use cannot be considered inappropriate, it is questionable whether it aligns with the original purpose of the subsidy. According to the Education Department, the use of the subsidy should be limited to the following three categories: (1) rent and property taxes; (2) maintenance and upkeep of buildings and equipment; and (3) staff salaries. Although it may be difficult to rectify the past practices of the schools concerned, from now on, after receiving the subsidy, each school should handle it in accordance with the above three uses and should not divert it to other uses, which would cause inconvenience. The matter was discussed and approved for implementation at the board meeting on the 24th of this month. Furthermore, according to a report by the Director of Education and the Director of Health, a total of 176 private Chinese schools were found to be qualified and should be granted subsidies this spring. Twelve schools were cancelled or not granted subsidies. The reasons for not granting subsidies to the latter twelve schools were that seven schools failed to provide sufficient evidence of expenditure in the previous year, three schools were making insufficient progress, one school was unqualified, and the remaining school had promised to rebuild the school building last year but has not yet done so. The above schools have been listed by the Public Works Department's Education Department and submitted to the board for approval.</p>

<p>The Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, in view of the fact that the Shanghai Morning Post has specially produced 100,000 student New Life Movement fans, printed with various slogans and pictures related to the New Life Movement, which can indeed help promote the New Life Movement, has submitted a request to the Education Bureau, No. 32931 of the Bureau's Instruction Department, instructing all public and private schools in the city to purchase the fans uniformly. This is to ensure that students, during their summer vacation, are constantly reminded of the tenets of the movement, deeply reflect on themselves, and develop good habits, which will undoubtedly benefit the promotion of the New Life Movement. In addition, since the day before yesterday, the Morning Post has specially dispatched people to various high school examination venues to distribute the fans free of charge to promote their circulation.</p>

<p>(Reuters, Berlin, 24th) It was learned today that Dr.贝尔塞 (Bei'er Sai), a famous German track and field athlete, has been sentenced to 18 months in prison because Bei'er violated the natural law of sexual desire. Since the National Socialist Party launched its purge campaign last year, the German police have been rigorously investigating such crimes. Bei'er was sentenced a few days ago, and few people outside knew about it. It was only when a Paris newspaper reported that Bei'er had committed suicide in prison that reporters here began to investigate the truth and learned that he was indeed in prison. It was found that Bei'er still holds the world record for the 880-yard middle distance as of this year. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<h3 id="e194">Guangdong Overwhelmed by Swimming Challenges <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>中靑 (Zhong Qing) and 麥令同 (Mai Ling Tong) Scheduled for the 28th; Date Conflict Makes Separate Events Inevitable</p>
<p>The Guangdong swimming team is a large group in Shanghai's swimming scene. Recently, both the 中靑 (Zhong Qing) and 麥令 (Mai Ling) teams have invited them to compete on the 28th of this month. However, the dates coincide, and it is unknown which team Guangdong will accept. Separate events are inevitable. The news is reported below:</p>
<p>中靑 (Zhong Qing)</p>
<p>Among the Chinese water sports organizations in this city, there are only the 中靑 (Zhong Qing) and Guangdong teams. The Guangdong team was established many years ago and has produced many talents. The 中靑 (Zhong Qing) team was only established this spring, with a naive organization and a lack of experience. In order to improve, the 中靑 (Zhong Qing) team has specially invited the Guangdong team to compete at 7:00 p.m. this Friday (the 28th) at the 中靑 (Zhong Qing) pool. At that time, all of Shanghai's Chinese water athletes will gather together to learn from each other and improve their skills. In the future, they may be able to win glory for this city at the National Games.</p>
<p>麥令 (Mai Ling)</p>
<p>After the 麥令 (Mai Ling) swimming team defeated the 中靑 (Zhong Qing) team last month, their skills were stunning and their name shook the city. They have now scheduled a special competition with the long-trained Guangdong swimming team at 7:00 p.m. on the 28th of this month (Friday). After receiving the challenge, the Guangdong team has replied to approve. The Guangdong team has long harbored the ambition to avenge their defeat. In addition to the basic veterans who have been in battle for a long time, 徐亨 (Xu Heng), 溫敬令 (Wen Jingling), 朱炯培 (Zhu Jiongpei), and 黎日新 (Li Rixin), they have recently been joined by the Hong Kong short-distance swimmer 黃日雄 (Huang Rixiong), nicknamed "Fast as a Dragon," and the new talent 吳幹生 (Wu Gansheng), the breaststroke king, as well as the Guangdong celebrity 王元立 (Wang Yuanli), making their strength formidable. They should be able to wash away the humiliation of the Chinese team's previous defeat. When the two teams clash, they will definitely fight to the death. The competition location and events are still under negotiation.</p>

<p>— （倪尙龍）(Ni Shanglong)</p>
<p>Whenever I hear, write, or see "Spring and Autumn," I always feel endless sadness in my heart. Because when the swallows leave, there is a time for them to return; when the flowers wither, there is a time for them to bloom again; when the grass and trees wither, there is a time for them to flourish again. But the Spring and Autumn seasons that we waste will never return!</p>
<p>In winter, hands are most afraid of being cold. If you put your hands in cold water again, you will feel particularly cold and painful, but as soon as you take them out of the cold water, you will soon feel warm. This is a wonderful lesson of "Only by enduring the greatest hardships can you become a great person."</p>
<p>A young man who grows up in luxury, or a young man who grows up relying on others and does not need to work for food, or a young man who is spoiled from childhood, rarely has great abilities. Compared to poor children, he is like a flower cultivated in a greenhouse, compared to a palm tree whose every branch must endure the beatings of storms.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Gardener <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 耘 殮 (Yun Lian)</p>
<p>Flowers are loved by everyone, and everyone is willing to appreciate them, cultivate their mind, and temper their temperament. Even scenic areas with clear mountains and waters ultimately need them to embellish them. Elegant ladies regard flowers as life, and even simple village girls like to pick a wild flower and insert it in their messy temples. Peng Zeling's appreciation of chrysanthemums in Dongli became a timeless story. An ancient person wrote about the scenery of West Lake in March, with the line "The light of the flowers is like cheeks, the ripples of the waves are like mirrors." Is it not that in Hangzhou, where the mountains and rivers are the best in the world, flowers also occupy an important part? Nowadays, social customs dictate that flower wreaths be offered at funerals, and flower baskets be given to celebrate birthdays. In fact, these techniques are purely artificial embellishments, exquisite operations, not from the hands of artists, but from the ingenuity of clumsy floral clerks. City parks, private villas, and educational institutions with the advantage of gardens all bear the footprints of gardeners: they are dressed plainly, have a peaceful mind, and are not at all impatient, as quiet as a virgin, as careful as a hair, unlike ordinary laborers. Therefore, from morning to night, from spring to winter, they spend their lives moving flowers and grafting trees in a peaceful atmosphere. Eight or nine out of ten of them are from the counties of Hangzhou and Jinhua, as if they have a gang, which can echo the Yangzhou barbers and the Chongming charter drivers. The higher wages are 30 or 40 yuan per month, and the average is about 10 yuan. If A finds a client with a higher salary, this old rice bowl will be transferred to another peer. To put it nicely, it is to promote the younger generation and promote friendship between fellow villagers, but in fact it is a "Monroe Doctrine practitioner." They do not envy prosperity, but live in wealthy families. No matter how much the social economy collapses, these masters of the gardens will never discount their wages, affecting the price of their labor. On good days in spring and autumn, the red flowers are brightly colored, the green leaves are fresh and dripping, and the yellow stamens are clearly painted. The shallow grasses are green as a lawn. These scenes, which receive the praise of everyone, are their comfort. Gardener, gardener, you truly deserve to be called "flower protector."</p>
<h3 id="e198">Old Gun <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 寒玉 (Han Yu)</p>
<p>The corner of Xizang Road and Baker Road is the station for several university buses, and many university students stay there. Therefore, many newspaper vendors do business there. The most eye-catching is "Old Gun."</p>
<p>His face is terribly thin, which is obviously a characteristic of special hobbies, so everyone calls him "Old Gun." After a long time, he also named himself "Old Gun."</p>
<p>"Old Gun" has special skills in selling newspapers. When people just arrive to wait for the bus, he approaches them and says, "Sir! The ×× bus will arrive in just a few minutes. Since you have nothing to do standing here, buy an evening paper to read!" People accept his suggestion and buy one. His price is one copper coin more expensive than usual. He knows that university students will not care about these.</p>
<p>"Old Gun" can not only contact students, but also contact the personnel on the school buses. When they are backing up, he pays attention for them; he also tells them the time. Therefore, he can go to the bus to sell newspapers. People sitting on the bus can always hear these words every day: "Sir, when you go, don't forget to buy ×× evening paper!"</p>
<p>After a business is successful, someone will come to compete. "Old Gun"'s newspaper sales are no exception. The number of newspaper vendors suddenly increased, and their prices were cheaper, which was indeed a great blow to him. His method of resistance was to abandon shouting "Da Wan Evening News, New Evening News," and use special eloquence to deal with the students. In this way, he defeated all these competitors.</p>
<p>But there are times when "Old Gun"'s business is not good. During summer and winter vacations, many students leave school, and the school bus business is particularly quiet, and his business is the same. Therefore, he always says when the holidays are coming: "When school is on vacation, the gentlemen can go back, but Old Gun is unlucky." Now that the summer vacation is coming again, "Old Gun"'s unlucky days are approaching.</p>
<h3 id="e199">Free Teahouse <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 方正 (Fang Zheng)</p>
<p>You won't find fashionable people here. There are only simple farmers and loyal farmers. Strong physiques and rough hands and feet are their only means of production. What is modern? What is patriotism? They never understand. But they are very devoted to mud and wood carvings of gods, so the entire rural area is caught in a vortex of superstition.</p>
<p>Their daily recreational venue after work is a small free teahouse. The so-called free teahouse is not a real teahouse, but the entrance of a small butcher shop, where a few stools and two modified broken tables become a free teahouse. Teapots are prepared by each person, so they can start talking. What is the content of the conversation? It is truly unbearable to listen to. It is not the old news of Emperor Guangxu, but stories of gods and monsters and martial heroes.</p>
<p>Occasionally, there are a few people who return to the countryside from the city, and they always enthusiastically advise them not to talk about those old and corrupt ghost stories. It is no longer that era. They will curl their lips and answer, "You are strange! Aren't you afraid of ××× on the List of Fengshen?" So new knowledge can never be poured into their brains.</p>
<p>Now Shanghai is promoting a literacy campaign. People who are unable to attend school and are illiterate now have the opportunity to be educated! This is certainly a good thing. But what about those ignorant farmers! I hope the authorities will pay more attention to them! It is best to set up a small public education center in the rural area, so that they can go to the education center to read books during their spare time. They will not only receive unlimited new knowledge, but also get rid of those unnecessary superstitions. Or send investigators to the countryside to conduct a field survey to find out how many illiterate people there are, and then send teachers to guide them. That would be very beneficial!</p>

<p>The heavy rain was lashing madly at the great palaces built along the edge of Longevity Hill, and with the darkness of the sky, the rain was falling in silver-threaded curtains. Under the eaves of several of the palaces, the light was so dim that the eunuchs moving about appeared as nothing but shifting black shadows: almost like the scenes I had witnessed in the ancient palaces in Mukden at night—and like the others in the palace I was panic-stricken and trembling.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager had been too much fatigued from her excursion on the lake yesterday evening, and, having taken a bit of cold, was feeling poorly with a cough; and when Her Old Majesty was uncomfortable, her temper was always very terrible:—so when the Empress Dowager was ill we were always very much worried and dared not forget for a moment that we existed and breathed only at her pleasure; a mere whim could stop us from existing and prevent us from breathing. As a matter of fact, I think all of us, men and women, at these times could not help considering Her Old Majesty as a kind of terrible old ogre who could injure our lives with ease: at least myself and the other ladies-in-waiting, and the eunuchs who were constantly in attendance, and Kuang Hsü and Lung Yu and several others who were more closely associated with her Old Majesty were of this way of thinking! However, at all events, I could flatter myself that I knew best how to handle her, for, at heart, she had been very kind to me, perhaps on account of my more liberal education, and for this reason she took me into her special favor, and often granted me special privileges absolutely unattainable by others; and besides she was very fond of listening to me talk.

<p>Zhiqian laughed: Paying attention isn't necessarily a bad thing. As the ancients said, "The object of affection lies entirely with us." But times are different now. Everything boils down to economics. Brother, it seems your educational expenses are already quite strained. If you have such a burden on your back, I can't bear to think about what might happen in the future. As he said this, Zhiqian's attitude was very calm. He fixed his eyes on Beihai, who was standing in the middle of the room, unable to utter a word. He looked down at his hands, secretly smoothing his clothes. Zhiqian said: You might have misunderstood, thinking I'm also pursuing this woman. Didn't I just tell you? My relationship with my wife is very good. If I were to take a concubine, wouldn't my wife and I get divorced? That would be a bad deal for me. Beihai, in his haste, couldn't find a suitable word to explain himself, so he raised his neck and replied with the words "a joke." After saying those two words, he continued to stand there. Zhiqian laughed: If that girl Ruochu is bought by someone named Jia, not only would you feel bad, but I would also feel sorry for her. However, eavesdropping outside when they're discussing things is not appropriate. No matter what his attitude towards us is, that man named Jia has been glaring at us. My suggestion is that you sit here with me for a while. Soon, Miss Yang will go to the Hu's house to get a reply. At that time, I'll pull her aside and ask a few questions to get a general idea. Beihai smiled faintly: What will we do if we find out? And what if we don't? Zhiqian laughed: Do you think we have any other options besides this? (249)</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3 id="e202">Cast Iron Woodworm <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Juanlong</p>
<p>Manhui was a pockmarked man with lips thicker than most. When he smiled, his triangular eyes narrowed into thin slits. In the village, he was quite a character. He was famous because of his pockmarks, thick lips, and triangular eyes. When trouble arose, he could take down several people single-handedly. He possessed a natural talent for scheming. As soon as his wife told him the rice jar was empty, he'd immediately borrow two dollars from somewhere to buy rice. But the day he would repay the money was very dim. Creditors didn't dare ask him to pay up. Otherwise, he would just puff up his thick lips, pop out his triangular eyes, and launch into a bout of boasting about how great he was, which would suffice to deal with the debt collection for the time being. The money and property he had openly and secretly taken from close relatives and neighbors was too much to calculate. Almost everyone in the village was in debt to him... Therefore, besides calling him "Old Scoundrel Pockface" behind his back, people also gave him a nickname: "Cast Iron Woodworm."</p>
<p>People had to rely on their own hard work to make a living year-round, but he could get by by boring here and there like a cast iron woodworm. He could even find food to eat in cast iron. He wasn't seen barefoot in the fields for more than a few days out of the year, yet he lived a more comfortable life than others. He had fish and meat for every meal and brewed several jars of wine. After each meal, he would take a pot, drink his fill, and then go to the neighborhood to boast. Everyone in the village was afraid of his ferocity, so they had no choice but to treat him like a local god, which made him puff up his thick lips, happily turning his triangular eyes into two thin slits.</p>
<p>The dry goods store in the neighborhood had been owing him a substantial amount of money for a long time. When the end of the year arrived, and people were desperately trying to find a way out, he would put on his pockmarked face, and smile with his triangular eyes narrowed to thin slits, and go to the boss:</p>
<p>"Old Song, you've been too busy these past few days! Let me collect some debts for you!"</p>
<p>"Ah! No, I don't need it! I wouldn't dare! You're busy too!" Old Guan knew that he was up to his old tricks again, and could only secretly lament in his heart: "He wants to buy on credit again!"</p>
<p>The New Year was the period when gambling was at its most intense. Although debt collectors were pressing people for money at home all day long, he still spent his days gambling, half avoiding debt and half gambling. When he lost all his money and returned home, he would vent his anger by scolding and beating his wife or daughter.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had done too much evil in his life. Now that he was over forty years old, he still had no son. No one in the village failed to secretly curse him behind his back: "Heaven has eyes! This kind of person will never have a son, and he'll get what's coming to him!" But the "Cast Iron Woodworm" himself said it was just bad luck, so he desperately ate vegetarian food on the first and fifteenth of each month. On major festivals or the birthdays of Guanyin and Buddha, he and his wife would piously follow the other Buddhist women to temples to burn incense and sit through the night. He would even wear straw sandals and bring some rice to trek fifty or sixty miles to the Great Buddha Temple for the festival... But Guanyin Bodhisattva still refused to give him a son!</p>
<p>He had used his "Cast Iron Woodworm" skills to scheme several times over the inheritance or division of property of close relatives. When his older brother and fourth younger brother died, he swallowed up their two shares of the inheritance. When his second younger brother died, fortunately, he had a son. Although he couldn't seize that share of the property, he still managed to cheat and take a considerable amount. When the sister-in-law of his neighbor A Xiang died (her husband had died early), that property should have been inherited by A Xiang's eldest son. But because she had a scandalous affair with the "Cast Iron Woodworm," the "Cast Iron Woodworm" took the opportunity to make the property fall apart early on. By the time she died and A Xiang's eldest son inherited it, he discovered that only four-tenths of the property remained! Although A Xiang understood perfectly well in his heart, he could only dare to be angry but not speak out!</p>
<p>When the City God Temple was to be renovated, he used his scheming skills to wrangle the position of person in charge, ostensibly to fulfill some obligations for the public, but secretly he was desperately filling his pockets! After the temple was renovated, he triumphantly turned up his thick lips in the neighborhood and said:</p>
<p>"After living a lifetime, I've finally done some filial duty for the City God!"</p>

<h3 id="e203">Finance. U.S. Purchase of Silver Still Sees Price Fall. Gold Market Again Experiences Intense Bullish Surge. <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Breaching the 820 Yuan Mark. Result: Sharp Increase of 22.2 Yuan</p>
<p>After yesterday's reactionary pullback, the gold market unexpectedly saw a decline in overseas silver prices. Although the U.S. tried to buy as much as possible at low prices, Indian sales were extremely heavy, suppressing the market price and making it difficult to rise. Investor confidence turned bullish, the hopes of bearish investors dimmed, and a short squeeze suddenly occurred in the market (37 long positions, 7 short positions). The highest price surged to 823.8 yuan. It was learned that overseas silver markets in the UK and the U.S. had fallen sharply in the morning. There were rumors that after the market closed, India sold in large quantities and the U.S. bought as much as possible. Market conditions remained stable and prices were the same as at the close, which greatly disappointed bearish investors. The Montreaux forward silver market fell by 1.65 to 1.85 fen. Indian silver continued to fall by 1 rupee 4 annas after closing. London raw gold fell by 1.5 shillings. Exchange rates rose slightly. The pessimistic sentiment of the previous night quickly turned bullish. In pre-market trading, prices rose from 805-6 yuan to 807-8 yuan. Large players took profits, and prices fell back to 803-4 yuan. The Central Bank's official exchange rate was announced, with both the British and American rates falling. Customs gold units rose by 9 li, and the standard price for gold bullion was raised to 846.9 yuan. The market opened high in the morning. After opening, due to the strengthening of the foreign exchange market, it rose sharply and then fell. The Central Bank again dumped shillings. Although the HSBC official exchange rate was stable, the internal market was flooded with selling pressure. Large players sold off one after another, and prices weakened for a time. However, buyers took advantage of the low prices to maintain support, and prices recovered significantly. Chinese merchants were generally bullish. Afterwards, they continued to buy, tightening the internal market and triggering a bullish surge. Reuters reported that the Hong Kong foreign exchange market was full of buyers and lacked sellers. HSBC's official exchange rate was reduced by 1.25 and 1.875, breaking through the 10-yuan mark. Short sellers panicked and rushed to cover their positions. Large players reappeared and entered the market, and bank selling slowed down. The foreign exchange market tightened further, and the market became oversupplied, with prices rising sharply. Prices recovered slightly at noon. In the afternoon market, the foreign exchange market was normal, and bullish investors exited, causing prices to weaken. Banks, on the other hand, had a buying appetite. The first report of Indian silver was down 4 annas, which was bullish. Seeing that prices were difficult to fall, people came to buy again, and prices suddenly surged outside the 20-yuan mark. There was still a pullback at this time, but investor confidence was very high. The foreign exchange market was extremely tight, and the Hong Kong market was also soft. Prices still broke through the 20-yuan mark, and the trend was quite firm. However, large players took profits at high prices, and prices retreated back into the 20-yuan range. Finally, supply and demand balanced, and prices fluctuated. The third report of Indian silver was up 3 annas, and the market situation had stabilized. Market conditions were bullish throughout the day, and the bullish trend was quite strong. The spot market remained stable, and the swap spread rose by 1.5 yuan. Here is a record of the day's market conditions:</p>
<p>The market opened at 804.3 yuan in the morning, up 7.5 yuan from the previous closing. Dadecheng, Fuxing, Xiaohongkang, and Yongshang reached 3.5 yuan.

The Central Bank was willing to issue shillings for June at 4375 and spot halfpence. Investor confidence weakened. Fu and Yong, Dadecheng, Yongli Heng, Yuhuixiang came to sell, falling to 1.8 yuan. Chunyuan, Yong, Dadecheng, Hengyu, and Yiyu took advantage of the low prices to cover their positions, rising back to 3.6 yuan. It was learned that HSBC's official exchange rate was the same for both the UK and the US, and the market was still bullish. Afterwards, Xingye sold American dollars for June at 25.

Dadecheng Hengyu and Qingfa Yong also sold at 3.7 yuan. Dafa Yong and Yuanyi Fuxing Yong entered the market one after another, still rising. Then, the second report of Indian silver was down 11 annas, and the market was weak again, triggering a buying frenzy that broke through the 20-yuan mark, reaching 21 yuan.

<p>Afternoon Slightly Short Covering... Slight Recovery Seen</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange suspended the auction of June futures, pending settlement on the 27th. Only the July pressing oil futures were auctioned. The market remained turbulent. Initially, after the aggressive short squeeze in the morning, market sentiment turned weak. Rumors then resurfaced, causing large investors to close out positions one after another, which intensified the downward trend. Prices fell across the board with considerable force. Later, short covering by various groups and absorption by large investors slowed the decline, and prices gradually rebounded. After rising initially and then falling, most bonds still closed down about half a yuan. Looking ahead, due to the instability of the environment and the continued tightening of credit, the bond market is under dual pressure and is unlikely to see positive development. Yesterday's trading saw large-scale selling of 78, 53, and 35 bonds in the morning sessions, which made it difficult for the market to recover. Prices fell by 30 to 50 cents in each session. At the opening of the afternoon session, the earlier declines continued. However, the purchase of No. 43 bonds and short covering by retail investors led to a rebound. At the close, buying from various groups was still very active, and most bonds rose by more than half a yuan. The 96 bond price remained stable throughout, fluctuating around 5 cents to 10 cents. The total turnover for the day was 14,850,000 yuan. The highs, lows, and closing prices are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>The bullish camp is strong, and many expect further price increases</p>
<p>The yarn market continues to be weak, the environment is poor, and new buyers show little interest. Spot yarn sales have become sluggish again, and foreign firms continue to sell despite price increases. However, a major investor has absorbed over 10,000 bales, and many expect prices to rise further. Changfeng has been actively buying in the forward market. This month's situation is stable, with deliveries around 1,000 bales. The final trade was at 162 yuan, down 9 yuan from the June futures price of 171 yuan.</p>
<p>End of Month Yarn: 160 yuan</p>
<p>At the opening of the standard yarn market, there were rumors of someone buying for this month, and the market was relatively stable. However, as trading moved to the distant months, the market weakened. Changfeng also began selling, and prices gradually declined. However, a certain investor's long position remained unchanged. As a result, prices for all months fell by 40 cents to 1.10 yuan compared to the previous month's closing price. At the opening of the afternoon session, the market for this month weakened, but the market for distant months was firmer due to rising margin calls. There are buyers and sellers for this month, and both sides are evenly matched. However, Da Kee bought heavily in the distant months, and Changfeng bought an additional 1,750 bales. As a result, this month's price fell by 1.50 yuan compared to the morning's closing price, while distant months rose by 30 to 40 cents. Changfeng sold 1,250 bales, Taichang 550 bales, Xiesheng 800 bales, Dachang 550 bales, Tongfu 450 bales, Ruidah 450 bales, Changyu 1,600 bales, Renfeng 550 bales, Yongdah 750 bales, Xinhua 600 bales, and Dachang 550 bales.

<p>Rain Clears, American Cotton Declines</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened lower. Most of the July contracts were rolled over to distant months. Prices fell by 8 to 12 points in each month due to unfavorable news from Liverpool, good weather, profit-taking by brokers, and selling from the Far East. They later rebounded due to short covering in the July contracts. Spot demand is sluggish, and the closing was flat and weak. Spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures fell by 6 to 10 points. British spot cotton rose by 1 point, and futures fell by 3 points. The Indian cotton market was small, and prices weakened due to slight profit-taking.

<h3 id="e211">Grains: Wheat Futures Gradually Improving <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>——Spot Prices High and Stable, Medium Prices Flat——</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market saw quiet trading in the morning sessions, with little price fluctuation. Foreign wheat prices were only slightly up by 8 to 12 cents. Buyers and sellers within and outside the industry were watching. As the afternoon session opened, market sentiment gradually improved. The flour market was tight, and there was a continuous intention of rain, so the market sentiment tended to be stable. It is expected that the arrival of rain-affected wheat will be difficult to become a reality in the short term, because this year's output is relatively small, and farmers need to prepare for famine, so the prosperity of previous years still has to be waited for. As a result, prices for July, August, and September rose by 3 cents each, while the rest remained unchanged. Spot wheat prices are stable for high-quality wheat, and flat for medium-quality wheat. The opening prices were: Mingguang wheat from Kaiguan Store at 3.46 yuan, Chuzhou wheat at 3.44 yuan, Daqiao wheat at 3.40 yuan, Danyang wheat at 3.35 yuan, Jiangxinzhou wheat at 3.38 yuan, Hezhou wheat at 3.33 yuan, Xiashu wheat at 3.34 yuan, Taijie wheat at 3.40 yuan, secondary wheat at 3.33 yuan, Zhitang wheat at 3.34 yuan, Penglai wheat at 3.37 yuan, Kunshan wheat at 3.43 yuan, secondary wheat at 3.38 yuan. Fuxin and Xinda each sold 1,000 bales, and Fufeng sold 1,000 bales.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the flour market generally trended stable. Foreign wheat quotations, Chicago down 8 to 12 cents, Canadian down 8 to 10 cents each. However, the market sentiment, did not have flour factories add chips in new goods stall, it is a rare thing.

<h3 id="e213">He Xia Rice Frequently Declines <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>——Foreign Rice Sales Also Weak——</p>
<p>Yesterday, Du rice (South Shanghai) arrived from various sources, a total of 25 numbers, (goods total more than 5,000 stone). Apart from a slight increase in purchases on the market, there were no large buyers. Sales were sluggish, and the market showed a downward trend. The prices of various thick Japonica and late rice varieties continued to fall. High-quality rice fell by a small amount, while medium-quality rice fell by about 20 cents. The prices of Yinbian Yuan and Du Jian also fell by 10 to 20 cents. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, 17 or 18 shipments arrived from He Xia. Sales on the market remained weak. White Japonica rice fell by another 10 cents, thin rice and early Japonica rice fell by 10 to 20 cents, white yuan rice fell by 10 cents, and other varieties also fell by small amounts of several cents to a dime.</p>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw a decrease in sales. The mainland has been shipping goods for months, and local demand is sufficient. Ports such as Huzhou, Zhaxhi, and other ports along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway are overstocked. After the rain, everyone is busy with farming, and demand is even weaker. Yesterday, shipments to the Yangtze River area and the northern ports were suspended. Only inland areas within the city slightly responded. The entire market only opened less than 5,000 bags. With weak sales, the market immediately cut prices by 3 cents. New orders continue to arrive in Shanghai, and a turnaround is expected only when sales in various areas become active. However, the upstream of the Yangtze River already has too much rain, and the future market cannot yet be grasped.</p>
<h3 id="e214">Soybean Cake Declines, Yellow Beans Remain Weak <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean cake market fell because the large and fast city telegram reported a decline, causing inventory holders to feel timid. The morning market immediately dumped prices, resulting in a drop over the previous day's gains. In general, the situation is bad, the people are shaky, and a momentary bad news, the market can stir up trouble. Yesterday the transaction was not lonely and total sales of cakes even approached 10,000 cakes. Yellow beans once turned up, but was only for a brief time, and there was exhaustion. Transactions were instantly tightened. Factories had already made big volume orders of date-beans, so now beans were not needed. Hence, there were only Jiangbei Tongzhu gang and this neighbourhood asking for them in the markets. Yesterday's report made the opening of Guidet beans with 700 bags, for 3.30 yuan. Siping road beans had three cars, for 3.48 yuan, and Niuzhaung had small eyed 200 bags of beans, for 3.58 yuan.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw a sudden rise in customs gold, with the listed price at 1.668, having previously traded at 1.685, so market sentiment was slightly stabilized. However, sales remained sluggish, leading to a situation where "rising tides do not lift all boats." The guild set the price for No. 14 coarse sand white sugar at 16.10 yuan, up 15 cents, but there were no transactions. Re-export goods were priced at 5 yuan, but there were no buyers, and they were later traded at 4.90 yuan for 100 bags. Taikoo Sugar's B mark was priced at 17.50 yuan, up 30 cents. The local factory's No. 1 refined white sugar was priced at 15.40 yuan, but there were no transactions. The Chaozhou gang continued to offer over 100 bags of refined red sugar at 11 yuan, down about 2 yuan. More than 50 bags of Gao Huanggang Qing sugar were priced at 10.02 yuan. The Jian gang offered a small amount of unified hand ice sugar at 14.80 yuan.</p>

<p>Xiamen tangerine peel, the supply and sales of which has been quite rare recently, market conditions are very sluggish. But the price of Wenzhou goods is low, the quality of which is lower than the Xiamen goods. Therefore, the goods do not share the same price, so buying the Xiamen goods is still not possible. Yesterday, it was heard a number of companies has begun to open around thirty to forty buckets, the price of which is less than the previously mentioned goods by five cents. Market prices appear to settle down here.</p>

<p>Yesterday's green tea market was active. Zhen Mei green tea from Wuyuan, Tunxi, and other areas such as Suiyuan and Zhizhi, was briskly traded. British firms such as Yingzhuang, Xiehe, Yihua, Jinlong, and Tianyu were sparing no effort in their purchases due to favorable exchange rates. In addition, market inventories are low, and the supply of tea from the mainland has completely stopped, so the source is not abundant. Therefore, market sentiment is stable, and prices are trending upward. High-grade extracted heart tea and Suian goods have increased by 4 to 5 yuan, and needle-shaped green tea with excellent strips has also increased by 2 yuan. The situation is gradually improving.</p>

<p>——White Drill Exceptionally Quiet——</p>
<p>White serge and white drill are popular wool fabrics for summer. Tailor shops have large inventories. However, due to tight credit this year, sales have decreased and prices have fallen. Yiji's Daoxiancao (No. 111) white serge is selling for only 4.35 yuan per yard. Heji's No. 1 Laopi white drill is wholesaling for 6.10 yuan per yard. The market for other miscellaneous brands is even more chaotic. White drill sales are very slow this summer because most customers of Western clothing shops do not like to order it. However, cheap Japanese goods priced at around 3 yuan are selling well. White serge sales are slightly better. Japanese white serge priced at around 3 yuan is selling particularly well.</p>

<h3 id="e219">On Wu Jianren's Novels <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>Wu Jianren, a native of Foshan, like Li Boyuan, the head of Nan Ting, did not publish any systematic theory about novels. What can be found now are only some scattered short articles, scattered in various magazines at that time. To talk about his understanding of novels based on his views on novels, these are the only materials.</p>
<p>The most important one is the "Preface to Monthly Novels," in which he presents his views on novels head-on. In addition to agreeing with Liang Qichao's "The Relationship Between Novels and Governance," recognizing the importance of novels, he added two meanings: one is "sufficient to supplement memory," and the other is "easy to input knowledge." His reason is that "profound and difficult-to-understand articles" are "not as easy for readers as shallow and interesting ones," and using novels to input knowledge will make readers "remember history and reason easily." In summary, novels are the easiest to spread widely and the most capable of moving people. He advocates "borrowing the fun and emotion of novels as an aid to moral education."</p>
<p>This view, as seen today, is really too ordinary, but at the time when we were beginning to understand the importance of novels, when "strange and disjointed" works were constantly produced, this statement was enough to correct many bad tendencies and emphasize readers' understanding of the relationship between novels and governance.</p>
<p>He pays special attention to historical novels. He wrote "Romance of the Two Jins" and "Painful History" (Romance of the Southern Song), but unfortunately neither was completed. According to his opinion, it is said that classics are difficult to attract people's attention because of their complex beginnings and endings, profound texts, and voluminous volumes. To make the content of these high-level classics universally and deeply rooted in the masses, it is only possible to use the style of romance. Only the words of novelists are interesting and can attract people, can supplement the inadequacy of textbooks, and can make "novels accompany official history to gallop, and official history use novels as a guide" (General Preface to Historical Novels.)</p>
<p>He is quite dissatisfied with the old historical novels. He said that many of them are capable of contrivance, but instead make the truth of history hidden and obscure, and there are many absurd things, which makes "the foolish even more foolish." He eloquently discusses this type of novel:</p>
<p>"I have often silently calculated that from the Spring and Autumn Period to the Chronicles of Heroes and the Iron Crown Chart, except for the States, those that are contrived account for 99 percent. Some even borrow the name of an ancient person as the main brain of a book, and everything except the name of this main brain is contrived. For example, the Chronicles of the Eastern Conquest writing about Xue Rengui, and the Wanhualou writing about Di Qing. As for the Investiture of the Gods, which uses mythological tales and borrows history for attachment, it goes without saying. The Eastern and Western Han Dynasties are also too brief and lack interest, and they cannot avoid falling into the talk of falsehoods and contrivances. The Eastern and Western Jin Dynasties are not complete and do not fit the style. Literary scholars see them and say that there is official history, why should I read this; those who know a little see them and say that I don't understand this, so it is like having no novels." (Preface to the Romance of the Two Jins)</p>
<p>He believes that these are not the right track of historical novels and should not avoid historical facts, so he wants to devote his greatest efforts to the creation of works in this area. Starting from this understanding, he also pays attention to drum lyrics and ballad singing. He once re-published Jia Fuxi's drum lyrics and wrote a preface for it. He also formally discussed ballad singing novels in a new novel:</p>
<p>"Ballad singing songbooks are called wooden fish books by the Cantonese. Although these wooden fish books are all contrived and unfounded, their main purpose is to talk about loyalty, filial piety, and righteousness. Even when telling the story of a prostitute, they must say that she died for love. Other things such as righteous servants taking the blame for their masters and filial daughters selling themselves to redeem their fathers are all over the place and cannot be denied, and there must be a very good ending. Women and girls who are accustomed to reading these books are educated, and customs also become better because of this. It is a pity that these wooden fish books are rich in dialects and cannot be spread far."</p>
<p>He even attributes the non-licentiousness of Cantonese customs to ballad singing novels. Wu Jianren was a supporter of old morality, so this method is not surprising, but his ability to value these "lower-class books" that were looked down upon by the general public is unmatched. This kind of understanding is similar to that of Li Boyuan.</p>
<p>Some novel reviews at that time were often not objective. For example, it was said that Water Margin was a socialist book, that Pu Songling was an anti-foreign family, and that he specialized in nationalism, and that the Strange Tales from a Chinese Studio faction all referred to Manchus. Wu Jianren did not think so. He raised objections several times. For example, he commented on Water Margin:</p>
<p>"For example, the Water Margin, records the harm of robbers, but today's people often say that it advocates egalitarianism. I am afraid that Shi Nai'an would never have had this idea at that time. However, he described these 108 people gathering in Liangshanpo, just like a present state of an egalitarian society. I have read it repeatedly, and I think it is a work of anger at the world. Our country has never had the saying of freedom of speech, and writing is always easy to cause trouble. Therefore, the heart of worrying about the times and being angry at the world has to be entrusted to novels, and even when entrusted to novels, one dare not write about it explicitly, but must use euphemisms and metaphors as allegories. This is the plight of the ancients writing books. The Water Margin is a separate cut of a biography of corrupt officials."</p>
<p>This is relatively objective, unlike others who forcibly pull it into the realm of modern thought. Therefore, he has a saying: "Although I do not want to use the ideals of the ancients to break into the ideals of today." He commented on Flowers in the Mirror, believing it to be "adding an annotation to the Classic of Mountains and Seas," calling it an ideal novel and a science novel. He commented on The Golden Lotus and The Carnal Prayer Mat, saying that they were works of punishing licentiousness, but he did not thoroughly understand Water Margin.</p>
<p>Wu Jianren's understanding of the society of novels and his critical attitude can be clearly seen from these words. He understood the importance of novels from a progressive feudal perspective, hoping to use them to change customs and transform society, and reform society. This is all the material about his theory of novels that can be found now.</p>

<p>Xu Ying</p>
<p>Carrying the cartwheel-sized setting sun on my back, I hurriedly rode my bicycle. As the last rays of the sun disappeared, and a few patches of sunset glow flickered in the clear sky, I arrived at Zhongyu's home. Entering the gate, I turned past the row of sunflower fences and saw the family eating in front of the eaves. I went in, disrupting their gathering.</p>
<p>"We thought you wouldn't make it back from the city—" Zhongyu stood up, saying with a hint of apology. His wife busily offered to fetch water for me to wash my face.</p>
<p>"Haha," I laughed, "Have I become a guest after only three days of moving out?"</p>
<p>At this moment, an old man with weathered skin, sitting at the head of the table, his head bandaged from a wound, interjected with a raspy voice and Zhongyu's local accent:</p>
<p>"My fault—my fault, I am sorry—"</p>
<p>This was Zhongyu's older brother, Boxian, who had fled here three days ago. He was temporarily staying in my room, so I had moved to Guan Di Temple to sleep on the floor. But I still ate meals with them every day. The family seemed to feel a bit guilty about this.</p>
<p>"You're too kind," I said, casually taking a newspaper from my pocket and handing it to him. "The news about your incident is on today's paper."</p>
<p>"What does it say?" Zhongyu's wife asked sharply.</p>
<p>Boxian took it with a dry, black hand, which was also wrapped in several pieces of tape. He only glanced at the headline – "Farmer Riot – Promoter Assaulted" – curled his nostrils, and handed it to Zhongyu without a word.</p>
<p>"Most people don't understand the suffering of promoters..." I continued.</p>
<p>Zhongyu and his wife huddled together, reading the news, intermittently making sounds, "What, promoters forced...", "The people are violent...", "Brother, – your office burned down?", "Ah, more than thirty people imprisoned," "Poor management, triggering – triggering a people's uprising..."</p>
<p>The haggard man silently picked up a cup of wine from the table and drained it in one gulp. A faint purplish-red color flushed over his dark face. I felt that I shouldn't have made the situation so tense, so I picked up the wine pot and refilled his cup, pouring one for myself as well. "Brother, please," I said, raising my cup in a toast.</p>
<p>Zhongyu also put down the newspaper to join in the joking. I reported a few pieces of news from the city, adding a few humorous remarks, and the atmosphere returned to normal, until we saw the stars in the sky.</p>
<p>Stars hung in the sky. The dining table became a tea table. In the center of the table, the kerosene lamp attracted green floating gnats, gray night moths, and shiny black beetles. Zhongyu suggested blowing out the lamp. In the darkness, we drank tea, Boxian's fingers tapping the teacup, seemingly playing a tune. A swarm of mosquitoes harmonized with a new melody. We each held a banana leaf fan, keeping "time." After a moment of silence, Zhongyu spoke.</p>
<p>"Brother, Mr. Li is here too, can you tell us how this promotion went?"</p>
<p>"It's pointless to talk about it," the raspy voice replied heavily in the darkness, "I won't scold the common people, and of course, I won't scold myself. To be honest, if it wasn't for food, who would do this?"</p>
<p>We listened quietly, the katydids chirping in the grass.</p>
<p>"This thing—let's call it a riot. I've been through it twice. That year in ××, it was promoting cotton. That self-growing cotton wasn't any better than the common people's local cotton, and the cotton bolls rotted easily, turning the cotton yellow. The first year we barely managed to plant it, and the first year there was a riot. This time, it's silkworm eggs. The silkworm eggs are good, they're good, but they go onto the mountains a week later than the common people's silkworm eggs. That week's mulberry leaves are the most terrifying to eat. That year, I watched mulberry leaves become gold, impossible to afford. Piles of silkworm babies were sent to the latrine. My heart ached for them too..."</p>
<p>Fireflies flitted through the sky. He coughed lightly.</p>
<p>"This year, the superiors sent down these silkworm eggs again. For the sake of food, I still have to promote them. I deserve to be beaten this time. The common people are not guilty at all. They are not for people to research. They have to pay taxes and complete their quotas. The whole family, old and young, depends on this for food and clothing. They are not guilty..."</p>
<p>We sighed together. To avoid making our friend suffer, we changed the subject.</p>

<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>The manager took out two cigars, handing one to Luo Fei. Luo Fei declined:</p>
<p>"Mr. Manager, I don't smoke."</p>
<p>"Really?" "Really."</p>
<p>"Ah, that's excellent."</p>
<p>The manager smoked his cigar, his eyes gazing absentmindedly at the smoke rings, then back at Luo Fei's face. After a while, he tapped off the ash and said:</p>
<p>"I think you're very good, good, I'll hire you. Come here at nine o'clock tomorrow to complete the procedures and officially start working. Miss Luo, don't forget this is my goodwill, only you were kept from more than twenty applicants."</p>
<p>Luo Fei thanked the manager for his goodwill and left.</p>
<p>Walking out of the ×× company's door, Luo Fei realized she was drenched in sweat. Fortunately, those meteor-like eyes were no longer revolving around her. She felt relieved and thought that Lu Wen must be waiting for her for a long time, so she hurried to the Jiangbian Pier, thinking: how should I tell him? Should I tell him about the manager's frivolousness? Lu Wen would be unhappy to hear it. Should I tell him I got the job? Of course, I should tell him, he'll be happy...</p>
<p>At the pier, she looked east and west, but couldn't find Lu Wen. There were many people, but he was nowhere to be seen. Anxious, she wanted to call out, but felt a little embarrassed, and she didn't have such a loud voice. After a long time, she couldn't find him and felt as if she had lost her heart. She anxiously blamed Lu Wen, complaining that he wasn't considerate enough. He should have come to meet her, like a victorious general welcomed by his lover.</p>
<p>Lu Wen walked over from the side. Luo Fei grabbed him and asked anxiously:</p>
<p>"Where did you go, Wen? I've been looking for you for a long time!"</p>
<p>"I met a friend and walked with him for a while. How did it go? Didn't work out, right?"</p>
<p>"On the contrary!"</p>
<p>"You mean? Hired?"</p>
<p>"Exactly."</p>
<p>Luo Fei could tell that Lu Wen didn't seem right, so she quickly asked:</p>
<p>"Wen, why aren't you happy? What are you thinking about?"</p>
<p>"I'm not thinking about anything."</p>
<p>"You're lying."</p>
<p>"Really, it's nothing, but I just feel that companies hiring female employees are mostly up to no good."</p>
<p>"It all depends on the person," Luo Fei smiled, trying to cheer Lu Wen up, "Is that right?"</p>
<p>"I hope so."</p>
<p>"Aren't you going to congratulate me?" Luo Fei changed the subject. "You should be happy."</p>
<p>Lu Wen did smile, and even jumped up and down.</p>
<p>"Of course, I should congratulate you. I'll buy you a thank-you gift later."</p>
<p>The two walked along the left side of the road on the sidewalk. They were walking home. Although they were a little tired, they now had a lot of energy. They looked very proud, and the sky seemed to deliberately shine brightly on their way forward.</p>
<p>"I forgot to ask you, when do you officially start working?" Lu Wen suddenly remembered. "When do you start?"</p>
<p>"Nine o'clock tomorrow."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow you will be a person with a profession."</p>
<p>"Tomorrow our lives will be a little more secure."</p>
<p>But Lu Wen thought about the "up to no good" thing again. Why did he have to think about that? He felt sad. He thought that his wife's job search was absolutely not a success of skill, but was actually similar to prostitution. However, keeping his wife at home as a good wife and mother was not his idea. He had always advocated that women should serve society just like men, and that women should do things just like men.</p>
<p>When there is no job, you are afraid of not finding one. When you have a job, you think about other issues. How contradictory.</p>
<p>Luo Fei was also recalling the moment in the manager's home. Thinking about it, she was a little worried about herself in the future. If the manager's frivolity continued, how could she deal with it? The retention of her job was also tied to his hands. As long as he was unhappy for a moment, she could be sacrificed. It seemed that she couldn't go against his wishes, but if that was the case, there would be more problems in the future. After thinking about it, she couldn't come up with a reliable solution. The final decision was still to do as she had told Lu Wen: It depends on the person. She added an explanation: stay if it fits, leave if it doesn't.</p>
<p>Lu Wen walked along and bought two packs of peanuts. He kept one pack for himself and handed the other pack to his wife, smiling:</p>
<p>"Fei, this is my gift to celebrate you."</p>
<p>"Too meager. Alright, a small gift with great meaning."</p>
<p>Luo Fei also smiled.</p>
<p>The Customs House clock pointed to twelve o'clock. The clerks of the company's banks took buses and trams to go home for meals, and some went to nearby restaurants to eat their fill. Every bus was very crowded, "One more in the back!" the ticket seller shouted loudly.</p>
<p>Lu Wen and Luo Fei were also a little hungry and wanted to hurry home to cook. After walking for a while, Lu Wen led his wife onto a bus. After they were seated, he said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"Anyway, we've found a job, let's join the fun."</p>

<p>— Written by the German Storm, translated by Chen Yinzi</p>
<p>On the Mill Pond</p>
<p>The New Year has passed. For a long time, I had been in love with my pair of smooth steel-bottomed Dutch skates, and I somewhat despised my classmates, because they only had those old rough iron-bottomed skates. But now the severe cold has arrived.</p>
<p>It was a Sunday afternoon a week. The Mill Pond, not far from the city, a lake of medium size, was covered with a layer of shimmering ice mirror. Half the city's residents gathered there, in the fresh winter air. Old and young, some wearing a pair of skates, some wearing only one skate, some even tying a cow bone to the bottom of their shoes, were practicing this noble sport of skating. Some tents were set up near the shore; nearby, on land, roaring stoves burned with steaming pots, and various warming beverages were supplied from the pots. Here or there, one could see a hand-pulled sled rushing from the crowd to the open ice, in the sled was a girl with a stern face, but everyone was still walking near the shore of the lake, the center of the lake did not seem to be completely safe.</p>
<p>I tied my steel skates to my feet and skated along the shore of the lake by myself. When I turned back, I saw that the dance partners had almost all gathered near the tents. The little girls were wearing winter coats, leaning forward slightly, walking tremblingly on the ice surface that seemed to have already formed tracks. Fritz had already put his yellow horn sled carved with a deer head in the mill the day before, and at this time he pushed Miss Lotte back, and another dance partner wearing a gorgeous tiger skin sat in the sled. This knight paused for a moment, looking around as if to find an assistant to help him with this not-so-easy job of serving the girls, but at this time I happened to turn my face away, because among the groups of working-class women and girls in front, I saw Rena Li · Bolijia; I had not met her since the last dance night. Those girls took turns calling a trainee—he was an apprentice of the carpenter who did business with my family—they pushed a light sled, and I immediately recognized that this snow-like thing belonged to my old friend Christopher. I also saw his sister, but he himself was not there. The brilliance of the ice mirror probably attracted him to the center of the lake, because among all the boys in the city, he was one of the best skaters.</p>

<h3 id="e224">The De Facto Nine-Power Treaty <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>The June 20 newspapers carried a report from the Tokyo branch of the Reuters news agency: "Regarding British Ambassador to the United States Lindsay's visit to the U.S. State Department on the 17th, a report from Washington stated that the United Kingdom and the United States want to form a common front, invoke the Nine-Power Treaty, and contain Japan's actions towards China. The UK, US, and Japan will take concrete actions, and the Japanese diplomatic authorities take a calm attitude towards this, believing it is not worthy of a knowledgeable person's smile... In the event that the United Kingdom and the United States join forces to invoke the Nine-Power Treaty and protest to Japan, it will resolutely reject it based on the following views: (1) The Hebei issue has been resolved by the parties concerned between China and Japan, and other countries cannot intervene; (2) The Nine-Power Treaty, which the United Kingdom and the United States often invoke, cannot be recognized as a backing for the United Kingdom and the United States to speak to Japan on the Hebei issue; (3) Japan believes that the treaty's effect has de facto disappeared after the Manchurian Incident."</p>
<p>From 1922 to now, there have been more than ten years of history for our grand "Nine-Power Treaty"; however, it has "de facto disappeared." Shouldn't the people involved take a deep breath after hearing this?</p>
<p>However, things are not accidental. Take the "League of Nations" for example. What is it "de facto"? This is also well known to "knowledgeable people"! Moreover, today's era, this world, seems too great. The complexity and change of all relationships are truly elusive. And "reality" is surging like a raging wave, not stopping for a moment.</p>
<p>Look; a shop with the golden sign of "One-Voice Hall" is hanging up colorful flags in the high sky every day with "Big Discount" and "Big Liquidation." It is said that "there is more than enough to cover both payments and receipts," but in the end, it announces "liquidation" and "closure." Natural disasters cause famine, and even a good harvest cannot make a living. You have a skill, but you don't have a place to use it... Even more like: on the one hand, some people are singing about "peaceful cooperation" and "calling for peace," on the other hand, everyone is implementing compulsory military service, rearming, building new ships, and expanding the air force... on the one hand, singing "national revival" and "peaceful construction"... everything is so contradictory, opposed, conflicting, and fighting—this is today's society, and also today's world!</p>
<p>Well, the "Nine-Power Treaty" has "de facto disappeared." And "facts" will tell us all the true masks!</p>

<h3 id="e225">Old Man Chen, the Broker <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>(One of the Scenery and Customs series)</p>
<p>On a busy street, there is a small room. In the center of the room is a square table with faded paint. People often wash clothes and sew quilts on it, so the table has become pitifully dilapidated over the years. Two rows of benches are placed against the left and right walls. A "Statue of Emperor Xuanwu" hangs on the middle wall, and some red paper scraps with "No Taboos" are randomly pasted on both sides, along with those slogan-like red paper strips. "Friends and relatives, recommend without guarantee," "Taking office immediately, a successful arrow (recommendation)": outside the door, black characters are written on a red-painted sign: "Old Man Chen's Employment Agency."</p>
<p>Early in the morning, after opening the sliding door, "Old Man Chen, the Broker," is very noisy. There are those who live in the shop, and those who come from outside to "get business." There are young and old: there are "raw goods" who have just come out of the countryside, and "old hands" who "have been eating other people's food" for a long time: there are old women who recently lost their sons and daughters-in-law in the famine, carrying a sixty-year-old body, risking death to come to this metropolis to be employed, looking for a possibility of survival; and on the other hand, there are those who abandoned their newborns, taking advantage of this good opportunity, desperately entrusting people to bring them to Shanghai, planning to use their children's nutrition—these plump milk, to feed the "young masters" in the "mansions," in exchange for some money to pay the rent... These people are all filled with anxiety, hope, and excitement, expectantly sitting in rows on these benches, curiously looking at the outside world, the outside people, the outside streets, and in their hearts they think about the familiar countryside that is broken but intimate, the relatives who hanged themselves in the famine, their own babies who have been passed into the hands of others, the past peaceful days, the mysterious arrival of "business," the fast passing of days and nights, their own lives tomorrow...</p>
<p>(How unbelievable the outside world is! Those big houses, those cars, those gentlemen and ladies wearing "foreign clothes," those terribly scary restaurants and theaters... This world is really not bad! But why do we have to live through days of constant famine, handing our babies into the hands of others?)</p>
<p>This is a mystery, a mystery that is hard to imagine: "Maybe—no, really! Maybe with good luck, you can "get on" in a good mansion, work hard for years, and even earn a few coffin capital, right? Isn't it true that the Gen Sheng mother's family in Xiqiaotou in the countryside, both the mother-in-law and daughter-in-law have "helped" "people" in Shanghai for several years, and came back to build houses, redeem fields for graves, and live comfortably?"</p>
<p>However, as she thought, the old woman who did "rough work" sitting on the opposite bench seemed to have guessed people's fantasies? And she was about to give this dream a head-on blow, aiming at some people's beautiful empty calculations, and started talking.</p>
<p>——Hmph, do you think it's easy to eat other people's food on the Shanghai Bund? These days, "one place is barren, everywhere is barren." There are many people who come out to eat other people's food, and the families who hire people are just "picking the best and the fattest" to choose from. I've been in Shanghai for two or three months since Qingming, and I've been sitting in the broker's shop without anyone coming to see me. Finally, a mansion wanted an old nanny. I begged the shop to send people, and I promised him extra sending money. I went there to try it for three days. The superiors said: "The person is still capable, but the appearance is annoying, and the age is a little too old. We here want someone young and able to be seen in front of people." Think about it, isn't it annoying! I came back and was blamed by the sender, saying that I wasted their time, and they knew it was wrong. Think about it, we sell our strength, but we also have to sell our age, figure, and even our insides.</p>
<p>People all sank their hearts, as if even the "Old Man Chen, the Broker" large signboard outside the door was a little dusty.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Memories of Photography <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The year I graduated from county elementary school, my uncle gave me a camera as a souvenir. It was a very simple camera, much like the "box camera" on the market now, with a fixed-focus lens. You could take a good picture by pressing the shutter in the designated position. This sparked my interest in photography. During that summer vacation, I carried the camera everywhere, forcing my neighbors, uncles, and brothers to be captured in my lens. In the evening, I would pester my uncle to develop the film, using my father's study as a darkroom. Since there were no electric lights in the countryside, I made a red gauze lantern. When I worked in the dark, swarms of mosquitoes buzzed around, and I could almost touch a few small bodies with a wave of my hand. My uncle was particularly fond of me, and although he couldn't stand this unexpected sacrifice, he would pat my head and say repeatedly, "You're driving me crazy!" He would also provide detailed criticism of the developed photos, which naturally increased my courage. But the results at that time were really bad. Out of six negatives, I couldn't even vaguely recognize two of them as my uncles or brothers. I, however, was very excited. If it was a blurry shadow and my uncle asked me who it was, I would immediately tell him it was Uncle Dog from next door. "Who is taller than him?" I would argue as evidence. My father would always use these jokes as conversation material during dinner. But my interest only increased. When I was admitted to county middle school in the next semester, my uncle mailed me two books on "Introduction to Photography" from Shanghai, and I learned that the first step in photography should be to photograph still life. I already felt that the subjects of my photography were gradually decreasing, and the range of still life was naturally wider. The loquat tree in the backyard and my younger brother's "standing barrel" (a wooden device to prevent children from falling) were all captured by my lens. After a year of wasting countless negatives, my uncle would always pat my head and praise me as a photographic genius when he helped me develop the film, if he found a photo where the light, angle, and exposure showcased my photographic skills. He always guided me, pointing out the reasons for my failure in the bad photos. One year during spring break, I wanted to expand the scope of my photography, so I went to Hangzhou with my uncle. We took many pictures of the beautiful West Lake. Each picture was taken after Uncle Zhang had explained the scenery in detail. Almost every photo from that trip was satisfactory.</p>
<p>But after that, I lost interest in photography, which was a natural result. People often neglect food and drink to study something new, but after making some progress, they have already shifted their interest to another new thing. However, I carefully collected all those photos, arranged them in photo albums, and organized them chronologically. At the same time, I started collecting other people's photography. I bought photography collections of several famous photographers, as long as I knew about them. I remember once visiting the Black and White Society's photography exhibition. There were two photos with a price of twenty-five yuan each. I stood there blankly, not wanting to leave. When I got home, I was even willing to steal to get them, which shows my love for photography. Although I stopped studying it further after parting with the camera my uncle gave me.</p>
<p>This time, while moving, I found my treasured souvenirs in a broken box. Some of them were almost completely faded. When I opened the earliest album, it was completely a moldy piece of paper. I couldn't even recognize who the tall Uncle Dog from next door was. But I still carefully sorted them out and preserved them, hoping that one day I would suddenly remember them and review my old dreams. Childhood souvenirs are worth cherishing. They give me sweet memories and bitter sadness.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Chapters of Melancholy <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Yin</p>
<p>(I) Depression</p>
<p>The melancholy of the century is impossible to dispel. Wanderers can only lonely sigh without coherent verses. Long strings of days drift by in the taste of melancholy.</p>
<p>Who can I confide in, this unspeakable hidden pain? The traces left by more than twenty years of life groping in the sea of people are just a series of loneliness, a series of oddities, a series of coldnesses: Can the bright smiles under the neon lights really fill the cracks in life? Alas, the jazz played by the Filipinos is just the trembling of professionals.</p>
<p>What a contradiction, no, how tired I am of these days of wandering idleness. The summer night streets with bright moon and neon lights, the ease and cheerfulness, are enough to bewitch people. But what is a wanderer walking there for?</p>
<p>I don't understand. What accompanies a wanderer is just a long string of gray dreams that never end. Tonight, I carry my own loneliness again, crawling as slowly as a snail through this street with bright moon and neon lights. All the quick rhythms, in my eyes, become a blur, making me dizzy and my heart tremble. However, I cannot leave it. I don't have the courage to put away the intoxication of this decadent urban style, to open up new, healthy land sufficient to settle my own thoughts, beliefs, and emotions. I can't stop or awaken the disillusionment with reality, the melancholy of the century woven into my life. So, I can only lonely utter sighs without coherent verses, considering it a curse for the weariness of a wandering life. And the strings of days drift by in the taste of melancholy.</p>
<p>How heartbreaking is this? When I quietly reflect in the still of the night, I can clearly discern a clear path for this decadent life. Isn't this akin to self-abandonment, tearing everything apart, letting strings of gray dreams corrode the blood and strength of life? At this time, besides raising my hand to beat my head, trying to gain some spiritual relief in the physical pain, my heart will shout out:</p>
<p>——Why can't I be more energetic!</p>
<p>However, the days pass like a long flowing river: This cry of reflection, doesn't it also drift far away with the water like a petal falling on the water? Looking back at the current life, how is it changing? Alas, the price of shame is these flushed cheeks.</p>
<p>The melancholy of the century is impossible to dispel, and long strings of days drift by in this taste of melancholy.</p>
<p>(II) Silence</p>
<p>Ever since I shouldered the burden of life, I have been like a bird that has lost its flock, disappearing the innocent songs: The bitter juice of life has gradually turned me into silence. Years of drifting, stumbling on the rugged road of life's storms, I have never received love, sympathy, or understanding from the world. Coldness, slander, and jealousy, like a wolf with fierce eyes, lurk around me at all times, jumping out from time to time to take a bite. Enduring the pain, I let the bright red blood flow under my feet, silently seeping into the mud. This endless suffering, the young heart, has gradually faded away the elegant sincerity: It has turned into silence, calmness, and uses silence to pass the years.</p>
<p>But before the journey of life is over, the burden of life cannot be put down, and the bitter juice of life will become even more bitter and intense: This endless suffering!</p>
<h3 id="e228">Odes to Rain <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>I never dreamed there would be such a warm clap of thunder.</p>
<p>But although that thunderclap clearly swept past Uncle Nanhai's ears, and the thatched hut, like a sleepy crane on the beach, shook, he still didn't believe it. When he fell asleep, the sky was clear and there wasn't a single cloud in sight, it couldn't have changed so quickly—</p>
<p>This was the answer of his two minds: on one hand celebrating the seasonable rain, on the other hand still doubting that heaven was still so stingy.</p>
<p>He jumped out of bed, and trembling, opened the door to look at the sky. The sky and him, one happy and one angry, formed a contrast: In the southwest corner of the sky, dark cloud peaks climbed upwards, gradually covering the azure face, obscuring the twinkling stars, as if a touch would cause countless sparks to burn this earth. He, his face wrinkled like a wild lily, was so happy that he had no proper words to comfort himself. He walked to the front of the bed and hit his old woman:</p>
<p>"Get up and see—there's food to eat!"</p>
<p>The old woman followed his hand and ran out, her ragged clothes snagging on her body: her seven- or eight-year-old son was even happier.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>Hearing that there was enough to eat, he had been eating vegetable porridge for almost a month and never had a full stomach. Hearing his father's words in a dream, he rolled out of bed, shouting:</p>
<p>"Dad, I want to eat!"</p>
<p>He thought his dad had brought rice or something else home in the middle of the night.</p>
<p>He stumbled in the dark house, and the jars made a clear sound. The old woman quickly felt her way in, scolding her son:</p>
<p>"You little troublemaker, what are you eating in the middle of the night!"</p>
<p>"Didn't Dad say there's enough to eat?" the son argued.</p>
<p>"It's going to rain. When it rains, we harvest the grain and then we have food to eat. After eating a full meal, you have to sleep! Understand?" She helped her son up.</p>
<p>"Mom! I'm hungry." The son choked out a sob.</p>
<p>"Go to sleep! You won't feel hungry when you're asleep."</p>
<p>"The hungrier I am, the harder it is to sleep!"</p>
<p>Seeing that the son didn't go to sleep, he followed his mother outside to look at the sky. The sky was spitting out water, and there was a faint breeze and a stuffy heat.</p>
<p>"Don't blow wind; let it rain more. Bodhisattva, if it dries up again, we won't be able to live!" Uncle Nanhai murmured, like talking to himself, with one hand on his son's head.</p>
<p>The son smelled the warm wind, although it didn't reduce his hunger at all, but thinking about the white rice, the live crucian carp in the future, a drop of saliva oozed out of his mouth. (To be continued)</p>

<p>There are four Han Langens in "Autumn Fan Bright Lamp"; but these four Han Langens are not played by one person.</p>
<p>Lin Chuchu plays an old, dizzy woman in "Tianlun". Her posture of threading a needle and sewing is lifelike.</p>
<p>Luo Peng's recent work "Wild Geese Descending on the Cold River" is the first major drama since he joined Lianhua.</p>
<p>The script being written by Cai Chusheng depicts the wandering life of children in a very profound way. The power of the ending and the novelty of its form are unprecedented in Chinese films.</p>
<p>Ma Xu Weibang, the director of "Wild Geese Descending on the Cold River," recently lost a front tooth. Ma Xu said to people: "This is great, it saves me from having to put on makeup for old people's plays"!</p>
<p>For one shot in "Tianlun," a wooden platform five feet high, eight feet wide, and dozens of feet long was built, looking like a giant bridge. A large group of children walked in formation neatly and solemnly on the platform.

<h3 id="e235">"Triumphal Song" and "Humanity" <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>"Humanity," which caused a sensation in the film industry in those years, depicted the tragic struggles of the people in the northwest during the early disaster. Now, Yihua is producing a sound film called "Triumphal Song," which is also a story about the suffering of people in the drought. The directors of both films are Mr. Bu Wancang, one of the most famous directors in the Chinese film industry.</p>
<p>Although the theme of "Triumphal Song" and "Humanity" is the same, the plot is completely different. At the same time, the consciousness of "Triumphal Song" is more correct, and the story is more tragic and touching than "Humanity."</p>
<p>Obviously, Bu Wancang created new techniques in "Humanity" that were not available in domestic films at the time. Judging from Bu Wancang's special efforts in the work of "Triumphal Song," "Triumphal Song" will also have new and excellent techniques for us to see.</p>

<h3 id="e238">Calibration of Automobile Engine Ignition Timing <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Xing</p>
<p>——Commonly known as "Setting the Timing"——</p>
<p>Most automobile engines are four-stroke cycle engines. That is, the crankshaft rotates twice, and the pistons in each cylinder move up and down twice, completing the four strokes of intake, compression, explosion, and exhaust. Therefore, regardless of the number of cylinders in the engine, each cylinder explodes once every two revolutions of the crankshaft to produce power. However, the explosion timing of each cylinder must be fixed; it cannot be too early or too late. Furthermore, the order of these explosions, that is, the engine's firing order, must strictly adhere to the regulations and cannot be disturbed in the slightest. Only in this way can the engine's operation be perfected.</p>
<p>Fuel is drawn into the cylinder, compressed, and then ignited and exploded by an electric spark from the ignition system. Therefore, the timing of this spark and the sequence of its occurrence in each cylinder have a direct relationship to the explosion timing of each cylinder and the engine's firing order. Thus, it is necessary to rigorously align them. Performing this task is known as calibrating the engine's ignition timing.</p>
<p>When performing calibration, the piston of the first cylinder (the one closest to the radiator, hereinafter the same) must first be placed at the top dead center of the compression stroke. The different methods are described below.</p>
<p>(1) Remove the spark plug from the first cylinder, and press your thumb against the opening of its installation hole. Then, turn the crankshaft with the hand crank. When you feel pressure pushing upwards on your finger, the cylinder is in the compression stroke and the piston is moving upwards. At this point, remove your finger and insert a bent wire through the opening. At the same time, continue to slowly turn the crankshaft. Determine the point where the piston can no longer move upwards, and you can then conclude that it has reached top dead center.</p>
<p>(2) If the intake and exhaust valves can be seen after removing the spark plug, then whether the cylinder is in the compression stroke can also be visually determined. When the crankshaft is turned, observe the intake valve of the first cylinder (in inline engines, the two at both ends are exhaust valves, and the intake and exhaust valves in the middle alternate). The intake valve opens and then closes (i.e., rises to the top and then goes down), which indicates the beginning of the compression stroke. Whether the piston has reached the top can be determined using a bent wire, as described above.</p>
<p>(3) By feeling the valve tappet of the last cylinder (near the flywheel housing), you can also determine whether the piston of the first cylinder is at the top dead center of the compression stroke. Slowly turn the crankshaft until the exhaust valve of the last cylinder opens and then closes (i.e., the last valve tappet rises to the top and then descends). Then, continue to slowly turn the crankshaft, and rotate the valve tappets by hand. If the exhaust valve tappet can only be turned with difficulty, while the intake valve tappet can still be turned freely, then the piston of the last cylinder is at the top dead center of the exhaust stroke. In inline engines, the pistons of the first and last cylinders are generally on the same plane. Since the piston of the last cylinder has completed its exhaust stroke, the piston of the first cylinder must undoubtedly be at the top dead center of its compression stroke.</p>
<p>(4) If the cylinder head is removed, it is simpler. You can turn the crankshaft with the hand crank until the intake valve of the first cylinder opens and then closes tightly. Continue to turn the crankshaft until the piston reaches top dead center.</p>
<p>(5) The above methods are applicable to engines with overhead valves. For engines with inverted valves, the valve rocker cover can be removed. Then, turn the crankshaft, observing the intake valve of the first cylinder. It opens and then closes again. Then, feel the gap between the valve rocker arm and the valve stem. If the gaps for both intake and exhaust valves are similar, then the piston of the first cylinder can be determined to be at the top dead center of its compression stroke.</p>
<p>(6) For engines with special markings, alignment with the markings can be more accurate. For example, last year's Buick cars had inverted valves. A small hole was set on the side of the flywheel housing, covered with a movable small door. Two straight lines were horizontally engraved on either side of the hole, and a straight line was also horizontally engraved on the flywheel, with the letters "ADY" marked above it. Rotate the crankshaft until the exhaust valve of the third cylinder (i.e., the fifth valve counting backwards from the radiator) has opened. Then, continue to slowly rotate it until the straight lines on the flywheel and flywheel housing are completely aligned. At this point, the piston of the first cylinder has reached the top dead center of its compression stroke.</p>
<p>Once the position of the first cylinder's piston has been determined, it must not be moved again. The spark plug can then be reinstalled. Next, remove the distributor cap and loosen the locking screw on the distributor housing or the eccentric. If this locking screw is for locking the housing, it will be exposed externally. Once loosened, the housing can be rotated freely. If it is for locking the eccentric, the distributor brush must be removed, the locking screw loosened and removed. Then, place the distributor brush back on so that the eccentric can be rotated. Then, rotate the housing or distributor brush to ensure that the fiber piece on the points is being lifted by the eccentric, and the points are fully open. The contact on the distributor brush is pointing to a contact point on the distributor cap. This contact point is not fixed. However, for ease of remembering, the usual practice is to always use the contact point aligned with the notch or tab specially provided on the edge of the distributor cap as the standard. Therefore, to make the distributor brush contact point point to the standard contact point on the distributor cap, there is no need to install the distributor cap when rotating the housing or eccentric. Simply ensure that the distributor brush contact point is aligned with the tab or notch specially provided on the edge of the housing (when the distributor cap is installed, the notch or tab on the cap will match this tab or notch). After aligning in this way, the locking screw can be tightened, and the distributor brush and distributor must be reinstalled as they were originally.</p>
<p>When the points are fully open, the gap must be appropriate; it cannot be too large or too small. If there is an abnormality, it should be recalibrated. First, loosen the locking screw on the points with a points wrench. Then, turn the adjustment screw slightly inwards or outwards to obtain a larger or smaller gap. Then, tighten it. The normal gap is approximately twelve to twenty-five thousandths of an inch. To know the exact number, it can be measured with a feeler gauge. If there is no feeler gauge, newspaper can be used instead. The thickness of one layer of newspaper is approximately five thousandths of an inch.</p>
<p>Then, connect the wire from the distributor cap that is aligned with the notch or tab (this wire is installed inside the wire head protector on the cap and is connected to the contact on the distributor brush) to the spark plug of the first cylinder. The remaining wires, according to the direction of rotation of the eccentric, connect the second and third wires in order to the spark plugs of each cylinder according to the engine's specified firing order. For example, if the firing order of a four-cylinder engine is 1-3-4-2, then the second wire should be connected to the third cylinder, the third wire should be connected to the fourth cylinder, and the fourth wire should be connected to the second cylinder. The same principle applies to six-cylinder engines.</p>
<p>The firing order for four-cylinder engines is 1-2-4-3 or 1-3-4-2. For six-cylinder engines, it is 1-5-3-6-2-4 and 1-4-2-6-3-5. The latter is only adopted by older workshops. However, most automobiles use the former. It is best to determine and remember this firing order before disassembly (regardless of the number of cylinders, knowing the direction of rotation of the distributor eccentric makes it easy to determine the wiring connecting the distributor cap to the spark plugs). Otherwise, the crankshaft can be turned to observe the order in which the intake and exhaust valves of each cylinder open. Or, remove all the spark plugs and press your finger or a wad of paper against the opening to test the order in which each cylinder compresses to determine it.</p>
<p>After calibrating in this way, the engine can be started to test it. If the timing of the spark supplied by the ignition system to each cylinder is too early or too late (commonly called "advanced" or "retarded"), it should be recalibrated. If it is too early, the car will jerk when starting. If it is too late, the engine will make a "pop pop pop" sound, and the car will be weak and slow. When recalibrating, the locking screws must still be loosened. Rotate the distributor housing or the eccentric a little to make the eccentric lift the fiber piece and open the points slightly earlier or later to obtain the correct timing. Regardless of whether the housing or eccentric is rotated, rotating in the direction of rotation retards the timing, and rotating against the direction of rotation advances the timing.</p>
<p>During operation, the timing of the spark supply must be advanced as the engine speed increases. This is because it allows the compressed fuel to explode completely when the piston reaches the top dead center, thereby reducing power loss. The amount of advance varies slightly for each car, but the maximum is approximately thirty degrees. For example, the maximum advance for a Ford Model B is twenty-nine degrees, for a V-8 06" (V-type eight-cylinder with a 106-inch wheelbase) it is twenty degrees, and for a V-8 r2" it is twenty-six degrees. Older cars have a spark lever installed on the dashboard or steering wheel to manage the timing. When the engine speed increases, this lever must be moved slightly in the direction of advance. However, most cars produced in recent years are automatically adjusted and do not require additional attention. If there is the former device installed on a car, the spark lever must be placed in the latest position when calibrating the ignition timing; there must be no mistake.</p>
<p>If the engine's ignition timing is not properly calibrated, it can cause the engine to malfunction, reduce power, over-consume fuel, generate excessive heat, and cause the car to jerk, damaging the components. If this situation occurs, strict correction must be made according to the above method. Only then will you avoid unexpected losses to your car.</p>
<p>Note: Diesel vehicles use the high heat generated by compressing air to cause the fuel to explode. Therefore, this article only applies to gasoline vehicles and does not apply to diesel vehicles.</p>
<h3 id="e239">An Indian Car Owner's Praise for a Mr. Morris Cowley <a href="#e239" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c239" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">239</a></h3>
<p>— Fu</p>
<p>Mr. Folana, an engineer residing in Gwalior, Central India, purchased a 1925 Morris Cowley two-seater used car that had been owned by four previous owners four years ago. Mr. Fo has recently written an article praising the car's unexpectedly good performance since he began using it. The article is as follows:</p>
<p>Based on the reports of the previous four car owners, I believe that this car had already traveled 50,000 to 60,000 miles before I purchased it. After I took possession of it, I inspected it in detail and found that all parts of the car were original and had not undergone any major repairs. After removing carbon deposits from the valves, regrinding them, and calibrating the carburetor, the car achieved over thirty miles per gallon of gasoline. Later, the gasoline mileage even reached thirty-five miles per gallon and has remained unchanged to this day. Since I purchased the car, I estimate that it has traveled over 200,000 miles. The routes traveled were mostly in the worst road conditions in Central India. What is particularly noteworthy is that during this period, the valves have only been ground twice and the bearings calibrated twice. Due to my work, I often drive over 300 miles a day, but no breakdowns have ever occurred along the way. This is especially rare and valuable. I am particularly proud of such a high-quality Morris vehicle. (Fu)</p>
<h3 id="e240">Results of South African Test of a Ten-Horsepower British Ford <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Cape Town office initiated a fourteen-day endurance test using a new top-of-the-line coupé (i.e., the "C" type, ten-horsepower British Ford). This car was equipped with standard equipment, with the exception of the 25-gallon gasoline tank and fog lights, which were extra fittings.</p>
<p>This car continued to run day and night without stopping. Each week, the circuit measured 112 miles, driven by five drivers taking turns. Fifty percent of the circuit was asphalt road, and the remainder was corrugated gravel pavement, including a mountain road section.</p>
<p>The car stopped every twenty-two hours to refuel and change the lubricant. High-pressure lubrication was applied every 1,000 miles. There were only two stops due to malfunctions. "One was due to a small puncture in the tire, and the other was to clear the fuel pump and remove lint. This lint was due to the lack of a filter between the auxiliary fuel tank and the pump. This would not have happened if the car had used the standard fuel tank.</p>
<p>That afternoon, the car completed its ninetieth circuit, traveling a total of 10,055 miles. The average speed, including all stops, was thirty miles per hour. The gasoline consumption was 39.97 miles per gallon. Less than half a gallon of oil was used, and thirteen pints of water.</p>
<p>This test was supervised by the automotive columnists of the "Cape Times" and the "Cape Argus." The two newspapers also appointed a committee of ten independent supervisors and auditors.</p>
<p>Seals were placed on all major parts of the car. Only one seal was broken to clear the gasoline pump. The car ran perfectly and was even better at the end of the test than at the beginning.</p>
<p>This car was a new car, randomly selected from the inventory held by the Ford Motor Company of South Africa in Elizabeth Port. It was driven for twelve hours before the test.</p>
<p>The drivers were amazed by the engine's performance. Even when passing through mountain roads, the engine never felt strained.</p>
<p>The car encountered various climatic conditions along the way. For most of the time, the car drove against the southeast wind, sometimes with wind speeds reaching eighty-six miles per hour. On some days, the temperature reached one hundred degrees. There were also two days of heavy rain.</p>
<p>The water temperature in the radiator was between ninety and ninety-five degrees, and the oil pressure remained constant at thirty-five pounds during the test.</p>

<p>Increased Car Tax Revenue in the United States Last Year According to a recent survey by the American Automobile Association, special taxes levied on car owners in the United States by the federal, provincial, and local governments reached a record high in 1934. The total amount of motor taxes in 1934 was US$1,160,564,380. The figure for 1933 was US$1,128,262,331. A comparison of the two shows the difference. The breakdown of these taxes is as follows: provincial, county, and city combined, $898,226,722; federal, $262,337,558. Although provincial registration fees have decreased slightly, the increase in federal and provincial gasoline and personal property taxes has offset this. Thomas Henry, president of the American Automobile Association, said that this tax record should serve as a warning to provincial legislatures that are currently trying to increase tax rates. He also hopes that Congress will abolish the federal special tax on highway transportation.</p>
<p>Regulations on Used Car Advertising in the United States In the Detroit area of the United States, the sale of used cars is now subject to advertising restrictions. The American Better Business Bureau has established a standard of ethics. With the help of reputable car dealers and the cooperation of various newspapers, seductive and unethical advertisements are being rejected. Several terms and phrases are prohibited from being used. Therefore, in advertisements for the sale of used cars, phrases or words such as "perfect" and "like new" are strictly prohibited. The term "reconditioned" is also too vague. For example, any kind of repair on the car, from tightening a screw to cleaning a spark plug, can be described by this term. This method makes it easy to deceive car buyers and is therefore also prohibited. One rule that must be followed is that whenever a used car is sold, the year of manufacture and the body style must be stated in the advertisement. Using the phrase "free trial" to lure car buyers is also not allowed. The amount and timing of payments must be clearly stated without any ambiguity.</p>
<p>U.S. Military Orders Cars from Chevrolet Last year, Chevrolet produced more passenger cars than any other manufacturer. In 1934, the number of Chevrolet cars registered, including passenger cars and trucks, totaled 692,413, an increase of 118,040 compared to 1933. If passenger cars and trucks are counted separately, then passenger cars increased by 60,413, and trucks increased by 57,627. Recently, Chevrolet received a large order from the U.S. military for 2,200 trucks and 520 ambulances, with a total value of US$2,540,071.00.</p>
<p>British Austin Seven Speed Record Bertie Denly, who drove an Austin Seven in the Brooklands hill climb, recently set the International Class "I" record on the same track. The kilometer and mile records were 77.43 miles per hour and 85.95 miles per hour, respectively. This record is two miles per hour faster than the previous record set by Ivor Halet's "Emchee" small car. According to Tellis Valley, the Austin's performance was perfect that day, even though the weather was not very good. The original seven-horsepower Austin car was created in 1910, twenty-five years ago. The design of this earliest car, a two-seater open model, is very different from the current Austin Seven. The current four-seater is more comfortable, with air cushions, safety glass, and a flexible four-cylinder engine. Every feature is the latest. The progress of the past twenty-five years is truly amazing.</p>
<p>Dunlop Car Tire Launch Dunlop car tires are of high quality and are widely sold because they have oak fields and weaving mills. The raw materials are produced and managed by themselves, and improvements and manufacturing are greatly facilitated. They have oak fields in Malaya and textile mills in Lancaster's Lockdale, so the rubber and cotton produced are perfect. The products created are naturally extraordinary. The new "Ninety" tire is made from these excellent raw materials. When in use, it is naturally superior to others. This new tire is not only durable but also excels in anti-skid, firmness, and quietness.</p>
<p>Morris Sales Increase In January of this year, the sales of British Morris cars reached as many as 10,000 units. From this number, we can believe that Morris will soon set a new British car production record. According to Mr. Laut, chairman of the company, car production has continued to increase every week since last December. Therefore, it is obvious that a new record will be set in the near future. While Morris cars are selling well, the Cowley factory will not only spend £30,000 to renovate its interior but will also expand its factory base by one and a half acres.</p>
