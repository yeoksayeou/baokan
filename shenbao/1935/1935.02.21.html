<p>時評</p>
<h3>美國金條文案判决以後</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>美國之金條文訟案。自一月八日華盛頓最高法院受理審訊後。舉國朝野。即異常注意。蓋最高法院對此案之判决。可影響羅斯福之貨幣政策。而此貨幣政策又爲復興運動之主要部份也。觀於最高法院於一月十一日辯論終結後。遲遲不下判决。而政府則於判决前急籌對策。以防判辭之不利於政府。可知此項訟案關係重大。今此訟案已於前日（二月十八日）由最高法院正式判决。判辭分二部份。其一承認私人債劵之金條文爲無效。其二雖承認政府債務仍須照金條文履行。但政府不履行時。債權人不得向法院控訴政府。追償損失。</p>
<p>吾人欲明瞭此案。判决之關係。不可不先明此案之經過。及其重要性之所在。溯自一八一六年後美國之公私債劵均附載一條文。規定償債時應用金幣或用價值等於金幣之其他通貨。此即金條文之來歷也。此種規定。可使債權者與債務。者間原有之權利義務。不因貨幣價值變動而發生影響。此項規定沿用多年。已成慣例。至一九三三年羅斯福總統就職。適美國發生金融恐慌。國會爲救濟時艱。改革財政起見。乃於是年四月十九日宣佈停止金本位。同時對金條文之規定。亦宣佈無效。六月五日經羅斯福總統之簽署。成爲法案。金條文被廢後。國内輿論。非難紛起。甚至有認爲違憲者。因其與美國意法禁止各州以立法爲更改契約上義務之手段之精神相違背也。一九三四年一月三十一日。政府頒佈貨幣貶價法令。將美金重量自二五·八格蘭姆减至一五又二十一分之格蘭姆。即新美金一元六角九分僅值舊美金一元。依照此二種法案之規定。美國債權者所受之損失至爲重大。金條文案即爲受此種損失之債權者激烈反對。此案原告。爲巴爾的摩亞俄亥俄鐵路公司債劵持劵人挪門。被告爲該鐵路公司。一九三○年二月一日。原告購入被告債劵一千美金。利率百分之四·五。半年一付。並附有金條文。挪氏於一九三四年二月一日照章向被告索取利息。被告以根據一九三三年六月五日及一九三四年一月三十一日之法案爲辭。拒絶履行金條文。致涉訟於紐約法院。原告敗訴。遂上訴於最高法院。同時向最高法院提出同樣控訴者。共有三起。皆因此法案發生齟齬。求直於最高法院者也。</p>
<p>就法律言。政府之廢棄金條文法案。不但有違憲之嫌。且復否認一九○○年之金本位法。第二次自由公債法。及一切關於發行公債之法律。蓋此等法律均承認金條文者。在判决未宣佈前。世人均以爲最高法院必將根據司法獨立之精神。保障債權者之利益。爲不利於政府之判决。觀歐陸各國互相競賣英鎊法郎。購進美金。而美最高法院首席推事休士於一月八日審訊該案時。亦有「政府變更自由公債金償還之權限。究自何處得來」等語。人心之所向。於此可見。</p>
<p>最後吾人對於最高法院判决宣佈後之美國及世界影響。應有明確之認識。倫敦匯市已見逆轉。嚮之賣出法郎英鎊買進美金者。均一反前狀。法郎合美金之價。陡然上漲。而紐約市塲。證劵價格均有飛漲之勢。此種情形。或有視爲羅斯福貨幣貶價政策之收穫者。不知此乃投機者之乘機漁利。有以致之。非由美金貶價引起之市塲活躍也。</p>
<p>若更就國際借貸關係影響言。則中國及其他債務國欠美債欵者。倘引用此項判决。以業已貶值之美金償還舊時對美債務。美國將蒙重大之損失。不知美政府是否甘受此項損失。抑另有别種對策。此亦值得注意之問題也。</p>

<p>陸軍額擴至十六萬人</p>
<p>［華盛頓］衆院度支委員會今日繼續發表政府之龐大國防計劃、已將陸軍部所提空前軍需預算予以報告、據該會稱、此項預算總數達美金三七八·六九九·四八八元、其中一部分係購買陸軍飛機五百四十七架、惟此數尚爲造成世界最大空軍之起點、蓋今日衆院陸軍委員會主席麥克斯璜復又提出航空建造五年計劃一項、麥氏曾晉謁白宫、嗣後即稱、彼之建議係添造陸軍飛機四千架、海軍飛機二千二百架云、再陸軍部軍需案中、亦要求增加國防軍之力量、並擴充其正式軍隊之人數、自一二八·七五○人、增至一六五·○○○人云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］衆院度支委員會今日核准美國國防經費預算、規定以七·六八六·○○○元建造軍用新飛機五百四十七架、使美國所有軍用飛機五百四十七架、使美國所有軍用飛機增至一千四百四十五架、陸軍部在一九三六年六月底止之一年内、許有三一八·○○○·○○○元經費、較諸一九三五年增四八·○○○·○○○元、該委員會今日聲稱、如羅總統將陸軍人數由一一八·○○○人、增至一六五·○○○人、則度支委員會願續籌陸軍經費云、查空軍支出現達四五·○○○·○○○元、較諸上年增加一九·○○○·○○○元、（十九日路透電）</p>

<h3>取締軍火貿易各國意見紛歧</h3>
<p>［日内瓦］今日國聯軍縮會議軍火製造販運管理委員會再行集會、惟各國代表團之意見尚相距甚遠、難以謀合、故今日公開會議席間、關於此問題之調查員波蘭代表當即起立報告稱、歷經與各國代表團直接交涉、但至今尚未能擬就何種具體方式、以作繼續討論之根據云、後由大會决議、先將美國所提出之恊定草案、逐案加以研究、後復在辯論之中發現在軍火之進出口問題上、法國擬將民用飛機及其另件等、均應與軍用飛機同等處置、而美國則主張在此點上應有美國與歐陸之分别、此外英國之用意則欲在美國草案上所列舉者之外、擬就一更完備之種類單、蘇俄代表之意見則較法國所表示者更進一步、非但飛機另件應作軍用品看待、即凡製造化學戰爭及火藥硝磺等原料、亦應一律列入軍用品云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>英法再度談話倫敦恊定矢守不渝</h3>
<p>建議各節互相關聯</p>
<p>兩國意見完全一致</p>
<p>［倫敦］據可靠方面消息、倫敦宣言所喚起之談判、雖成本日内閣會議中之主要題目、然確切之决議、恐本星期底難有分曉也、唯第二步現象、必爲英法兩國再發一聯合照會、承認英德可以直接談判、唯所談之問題、應不限於天空公約、而應遍及倫敦宣言書中之一切公約、此間各報認為西門似乎有前赴柏林之可能、（二十日國民電）</p>
<p>［倫敦］德國答覆英法會同提出建議之牒文、贊成歐洲主要各國締結覆、英内閣明日亦將開會考慮之、然後兩國將從事交換意見、衆信英法當局雖以爲天空公約係即須討論之問題、但殊不以舍建議中所舉其他各節而不論、而獨訂該約爲然云、（十九日路透社電）</p>
<h3>英内閣研究德國覆文</h3>
<p>［巴黎］英國内閣關於軍縮問題各部聯席委員會開會、審查二月十七日德國復文、以爲二月三日英法兩國倫敦宣言所包含各項建議、乃彼此互相關聯而成一整個問題、各關係國不當注重其中一點、而忽視其他各點、此種見解、實與法國政府意見完全相符、然則英法兩國在英德兩國進行談話之前、所當答覆德國者、其内容業已同意、所未决者特形式問題、次要問題即是否當由兩國共同答覆、抑或僅聲明收到來文而已、據聞英國外相西門將於本月二十日前來此間、會晤外長賴伐爾、届時必將有所决定、似此英法兩國當延至三月初始能乃答復德國、而英德兩國要人之會晤、亦當延展至西門外相游法之後矣、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英報表示意見</h3>
<p>［倫敦］泰晤士報關於二月三日英法兩國倫敦建議之實行程序、有所主張、略謂吾人對於天空公約、儘可與德國進行談判、但必俟其他各項問題、（係指德國重返國聯會軍縮一般公約、東歐互助公約、多瑙河公約而言）取獲各關係國之同意、始乃簽字、爲今之計、允宜重行開始樹立部份妥恊、以期逐步實現全部妥恊、蓋全盤救濟方案、未可一蹴而就也、最妙之法莫如英國派員前往柏林、綠德國有權要求「平等談判」、終必得到平等談判、與其聽任德國頻頻要挾、而由他國勉强讓步、何若以友善態度直接允許之爲愈乎、新聞紀事報以爲蘇俄及小恊商各國對於東歐互助公約、甚爲系念、極願見其成立、並與泰晤土報同意、以爲當與德國直接談判、蓋德國重返日内瓦乃一主要問題也、每日民聲報亦抱同一見解、謂英法兩國之計畫欲其成功、必須各方以平等地位自由談判而後可、若由每一國家或某一集團國家提出條件、强人承認、則全部計畫未有不感受危險者云云、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>賴伐爾出席閣議報告英法談話情形</h3>
<p>［巴黎］本日外長賴伐爾在國務會議報告德國復文送來後、英法兩國繼續進行談話之情形、政界人士對於賴伐爾此項報告、竭力保守緘默、頃據探息賴伐爾在國務會議中、陳述法國駐英大使柯爾邦與英國外相西門會見後、曾電達法國外部有所報告、外傳英國曾以照會送交法國政府、當係因此訛傳、實則英國並無照會送來、又若干報紙載電訊、謂意國向英法建議、召集與天空互助公約有關之英法意德比五國大使舉行會議、亦非事實、大概本日國務會議未有何種决定、</p>
<p>始終信守恊定</p>
<p>至於近日英法兩國交換意見、則僅係關於德國要求與英國舉行個别談話後所引起之程序問題、要之、英法兩國政府在根本上始終信守二月三日之倫敦恊定、英國政府領袖對於德國所提出之要求、不問其作何種决定、法國當局無不表示贊成、蓋以此故也、柏林方面所希望之英德雙方談話、苟能促進各項懸案之解决、則法國自不勝欣幸、職是之故、目前英法談話之目標、殊屬有限、即確定兩國政府致德國之復文應如何措辭、範圍若何是也、</p>
<p>覆德不出兩途</p>
<p>大概英法兩國致德國之答覆、不出二途、或僅表示接受德國舉行直接談話之要求、其餘問題一概不提、俟對德直接談話時盡量提出、詳細磋商、或則就德國來文之各基本要點、作眞實之答覆、並重申二月三日之英法恊定、英法究作何種决定、雖尚未可知、然目前所企圖之最後目的、惟在以各國一律獲得安全之制度下、謀歐洲之和平、英國外交所企圖之目的、自亦不外乎此也、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>離間空施手腕</p>
<p>［巴黎］據「小巴黎人報」載稱、昨日外長賴伐爾在國務會議報告德國覆文送來後英法外部談話進行情形、顯然表示滿意、謂目前英法進行談話順利無阻、德國覆文所出之手段、不特不能貫徹離間英法之目的、反是以激起相反之影響、英國似已與法國具同一見解、以爲天空互助公約問題、不當與倫敦宣言書中其他諸問題分道揚鑣、（按即指德國重返國聯會·軍縮一般公約·東歐互助公約·多瑙河公約等問題爲德國覆文中所未道及者）至關於未來談判之程序問題、則法國當悉任英國自由採取决定云、惟「巴黎迴聲報」則謂德國已破壞重要之國際條約、此爲吾人所不宜忘懷者、英國如變更其原來之意見、則法國當不能再聽令英國代表法國、以負對德談判之責云云、</p>
<p>英國通知蘇聯</p>
<p>又據「事業報」觀察、自英法兩國倫敦談話以來、德國對蘇俄屢施抨擊、且英國已將英法兩國交換意見之結果、通知蘇俄政府、並謂英法兩國對於一切問題、取一致態度云、英國對俄此種通知、德国或或當視爲英國在精神上贊成東歐互助公約之明證云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>俄駐英大使宣言東西歐安全應兼顧</h3>
<p>［倫敦］蘇聯駐英大使邁斯基頃發表宣言、陳述蘇聯對於二月三日倫敦宣言書之觀點、頗爲時人所注目、邁斯基宣言謂、「苟無東歐之安全與和平、則西歐之安全與和平亦不克存在、歐洲大陸各部分均應同時獲得安全、此節英法宣言書已言之甚明、在目前互相牽涉之歐洲局勢中、如有人焉主張首先謀西歐安全、而置東歐安全於不顧、則其人非不明事理、即别存惡意、宜乎其爲東歐國家之所惶惑也、至於天空互助公約、目的在抵抗西歐方面之突遭襲擊、純係一種區域互助公約、與東歐互助公約具同一基礎、爲預防侵犯之優良工具、但必與東歐公約同時成立、方足以保障歐洲全部之和平、總之、歐洲之安全與和平、勝利乎、失敗乎、將視東歐公約之成敗以定之」云云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英派閣員來柏林德國政界延頸企盼</h3>
<p>［柏林］德國政府熱烈盼望英國閣員前來柏林、與德國政府直接談話、以磋商倫敦宣言書所建議之各端、德國政界人士希望英國派員來德、似以爲此舉實有關德國之威望、德國各報現均作此種諭調、「柏林日報」謂、「希特勒總攬、德國之大政、英國代表倘來德國、與希特勒折衝樽爼、則對於新德國之情况、當能多所瞭解」云、「德意志總彙報」則謂、「外國談判者今必須與希特勒當面晤談、蓋互換外交照會之階段現已過去、各項問題關係既若此重大、則各國主要人物實有一度面晤之必要云」云云、（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>美金條文案判决後</h3>
<p>政府將請國會立法消滅爭議</p>
<p>通貨政策碍障掃除銀派活動</p>
<p>［紐約］美財部表示意見、現金條文案既已結束、政府將於三月中旬進行其理財程序、而發行新債劵、以掉換行將到期之債劵、又司法部長古明士今日聲稱、根據金條文案判詞保護政府之立法案、並非極關重要、但可視爲結束此項爭議之舉動、今後控訴政府之機會、已不復存在、但在研究形勢之後、成立一種法案、使種種爭執水遠消滅、亦大佳事云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］司法部長古明士今日宣稱、政府或將要求國會早日通過議案、鞏固最高法院宣判金債案後政府所獲之勝利云、古氏在白宫與羅斯福總統會商後稱、此項議案之目的、在防制續向美國法庭控告政府云、該案仍在討論期中、自由公債持劵人宣稱、美元貶價後、大受損失、該案之目的、在預防若輩向法庭控告政府、若干法學家表示、最高法院之判决、並未關閉此項訴訟之門户云、目光遠大之觀察者今日宣稱、最高法院之判决、决定兩途、將來之政府必須選擇其一、二途爲（一）一切金貨應繼續儲藏於財庫之中、以期紙幣大貶價政策、得以持續、（二）容許黄金流通市面、以期美元恢復以前之金價云、但政府發言人則覺通貨政策進行中之障碍、現已撤除、新政派現正計劃提高物價及穩定國内外之美金價值云、過去盛傳國際將召集通貨會議、但於今日得悉、最高法院之判决、業已掃除美國參加該會之阻力云、據稱財部現在之計劃、旨在固定現在之元價、政府預備遏制金債案宣判後畸形之發展、以免重演一九三三年六七月間發生之不愉快事件云、兹悉一九三三年之黄金案、規定貶價限度屬百分之五十、此次最高法院之判决、承認羅斯福總統可在此限度内操縱美元、美元現已貶價至五角九分、故一旦通貨成爲國際間討論之嚴重問題、則尚餘九分留作與外國交涉之地步云、消息靈通方面宣稱、財部官員現正籌劃政府通貨計劃中之將來步驟、而提高物價與恢復信用、則爲若輩當前之目標云、同時證劵交易所委員會現仍嚴密監視證劵交易市場、如市價漲落過巨、則預備停止交易云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>［紐約］本塞爾尼亞州大學教授詹姆士聲稱、金條文問題今後或尚有後聞、昨日最高法院之判詞、不能使外國政府之執有美政府債劵者、不要求以目前低值通貨一百六十九元償付載有金條文之百元美債劵也、私人執劵者亦難免乘此機會而將其所有之債劵、移轉於外國政府云、惟美京人士以爲外人執有債劵者、縱請其政府作此要求、然亦無效、因此債劵純爲國内債務、而不在國際公法之範圍内也、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>［華盛頓］華盛頓法律專家今日預料、最高法院金條文之判决、或可使居住他國而執有政府債劵之美國人民控訴政府、要求賠償損失、因僑外美人或可提出證據、確曾因美元减值及廢止付金條文而受損失也、此等人於美元减值之前購買債劵、現在遷居國外、美元之購買力大减、其間損失自屬不貲、惟此等人數甚尠、財部官員今日表示漠不關心、至於外人購買美國債劵者、則不得要求賠償、因美國政府發行債劵、目的係欲美圖人民購買、外人投資當然亦受同等待遇、决不能因美元與其本國通貨匯率改變、而要求賠償也云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>［巴黎］法國已正式决定、不向美國要求依照債劵原有條文償付現金、所有領袖銀行如法蘭西國家銀行等、已奉令拒絶代表執有美國債劵之人要求賠償、（二十日國民電）</p>
<h3>美通貨澎脹派重鑄銀幣運動</h3>
<p>湯姆士提三項建議</p>
<p>［華盛頓］參院通貨膨脹派現又開始提倡使用銀幣之新運動、最高法院關於金條文案已判决、在實際上擁護國會調節國家通貨之權、參交員湯姆士乃立即利用此機會、今日提出工賑案之修正文、其目的有二、（一）發行新銀幣、以减低美元之價值、（二）提高銀價、使達於每盎斯一元二角九分之法定價格、然後可開始鑄造銀幣、毫無限制、通貨膨脹派爲達此目的起見、提及三種主要辦法、甲·以一元二角九分爲根據、發行銀劵、而以國庫存銀爲抵、乙·迅速實施財部收回白銀之程序、丙·國際債務凖以白銀抵償、參議員湯姆士聲稱、新幣發行不過十萬萬元、但可抑低美元至一九二六年之價格、而抬高銀價、然後美國即可提交成立關於複幣制度之國際恊定云、此種修正文能否通過、雖未可必、但若干方面以爲金條文判詞、確已開放通貨膨脹派積極運動之門户、然亦有人表示意見、謂最高法院之判詞、當可遏止通貨膨脹之趨勢、蓋若美元價值一再低减、則執有金債劵者未嘗不可控訴政府、要求償付其損失也、法院之所以否認執劵者有要求賠償之權者、實因執劵者並未受有損害也、故若眞有損害、則要求賠償之權、當然不可否認云、紐約金融界因恍惚不定之局勢、現已消滅、故頗欣慰、預料資金市塲之活動、不久當可恢復、雖國際貨幣會前尚不知何時始可舉行、然爲國際貨幣安定的大阻力之一、現已不復存在矣、（十九日路透電）</p>

<p>瑪德里　西班牙衆議院提議、向菲律賓政府慶賀該國憲法告成、獲得獨立、外交部長羅加當經要求將此項提案延緩討論、蓋西班牙政府已邊請菲律賓參議院議長奎松來西班牙游歷、俟奎松抵西班牙詩、再時表示慶賀、未爲晚也（十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英下院研究印改憲案工作</h3>
<p>［倫敦］下院今日已開始研究印度案之工作、其所辦理之第一重要事件、爲印督任命問題、工黨議員桑恩動議主張設立永久委員會、以前任印督組成之、英相須先與該委員會商榷、然後始根據新憲法而任命印督、桑氏以爲印督乃憲法結構全部力量之基石、此種重要職位之人選、不應有政黨色彩云、印度事務大臣郝爾聲稱、此項動議之目的、在使印督人選不爲黨派政治所支配、渠固表示同情、但將首相與内閣之責任移轉於一種委員會、則彼殊不能同意云、自由黨與工黨亦皆反對此項動議、故此動議卒乃撤回、保守黨議員胡爾麥提出修正文主張在憲法中規定印督除由國會兩院呈請英皇撤換外、不得撤任、但此提議爲三百二十四票對四十九票所打銷、繼討論全印聯邦之問題、胡爾麥提議設立大印度顧問會、此會以印度王公國及英屬印度之代表組成之（二十日路透電）</p>

<p>營業方針量力而行</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨晤錢業同業公會主席委員秦潤卿氏、據談、民國二十三年總結賑後、各錢莊均已上市、至於今年營業方針、均量力而行、因去年受整個不景氣影響、各業衰落、錢業受創甚鉅、故今年營業、須視各莊自身力量而定、例如病人大病以後、其飲食須視能否消化、起初吃薄粥、逐漸恢復、外傳種種、不足爲信、各莊所送之往來摺、早已開始、其未送者、並非錢莊不肯送、實係其本身信用問題云、</p>

<h3>顧馨一對洋米事發表重要談話</h3>
<p>洋米輸入多寡須視需要爲斷</p>
<p>供求相當今後應即限制訂購</p>
<p>雜糧對外貿易已轉出超佳境</p>
<p>大公社云、本市雜糧同業公會主席顧馨一、昨對往訪之大公社記者、發表關於購訂洋米經過之重要談話、兹分誌如次、</p>
<p>歷年洋米進口比較</p>
<p>我國爲農業國、糧食原可自給、顧以國内生産落後、災歉頻仍、國外農産過剩、積極傾銷、於是洋米進口、遂形成今日社會之絶大問題、溯民十八年、江浙旱災、民食恐慌、勢不得不仰給巨量之洋米、以是十九年間、進口達八百餘萬包、誠爲空前未有之紀錄、然當時能維持米價於每石二十三四元之最高限度者、亦幸有此巨額洋米之接濟耳、二十年長江流域一帶水災、但以全國收成統計、缺米尚有限、故二十一年間、洋米進口無多、當年外商某洋行所進五十餘萬包、以事實非復需要、售存三十餘萬包、二十一年起、連年豐收、國米充裕、價格慘落、二十二年間、上海一埠、非唯洋米顆粒無入、即某洋行售存之米、仍亦無人問津、比及去年、旱象演成、始得賤價出沽、如此可見洋米之需要與否、及其輸入多寡、要皆以國内糧食之缺乏、與充足爲斷也、</p>
<p>去年訂購供求相當</p>
<p>去年亢陽成災、舉國荒歉、民食恐慌之程度、幾與十九年之形勢相彷彿、於是洋米之仰給又殷、而洋米之輸入、源源不絶、本會爲期供求之適否、自應有切實調查之必要、近據各洋行調查報告、本年一月十八日止、訂購總數、達六百三十餘萬包、除先前銷售一百八十餘萬包外、目前裝運在途尚未運到者、與已經訂定未曾起運者、合計在四百萬包左右、（其於二月十五日運抵滬埠、約五十萬包）、併最近售存者、約五十萬包、總計在四百五十萬包左右、此本會在一月十八日前調查所得之大概情形、按諸本市社會局洋米登記總數、亦復相合、當與事實相差不遠矣、兹再就洋米銷路沽計、每天平均各省統銷二萬包、本埠統銷五千包、計至國歷八月中旬止、共六個月、其總銷數、適爲四百五十萬包、核與前項調查所得之定購總數、供求恰成相當之程度、故本會認爲從此應有終止訂購之必要、爰嘗通告同業諄諄爲誡、近且擬呈當局、予以根本上之制止焉、</p>
<p>雜糧對外貿易出超</p>
<p>至就洋米輸入與銀根之關係而言、上海現存洋米一百萬包中、尚未繳銀贖單者、約有半數、併未經運到之三百五十萬包、合計爲四百萬包、每包市價平均十一元五六角、除進口税三元五六角、係政府收入不計外、每包約值八元、則總值爲三千二百萬元、方今洋貨入超之數字、日見增多、已堪驚人、益復加以訂購洋米、流出偌大之金額、固難免社會人士之嚴重注意也、然以實際言之、雜糧業經營國外貿易、二十三年間、滬漢兩地輸出芝蔴、約值一千五百萬元、青島輸出花生仁花生油、約值一千三百萬元、其他油餅豆類輸出、約值八百萬元、總計輸出額、約在三千六百萬元之譜、若只以目前雜糧一業之進口計算、蓋已轉入於出超之佳境、如果國内農産豐登、洋米不復需要、無所進口、則雜糧出超之數、當復可觀、</p>
<p>終止訂購無虞過剩</p>
<p>抑尤有説者、當二十二年米價慘落之時、本會首先籲請政府、加徵洋米進口税、以裕國計、並期收救濟農村之實效、今日則情異勢變、國米缺乏、民食所需、我同業爲應内地客家之委托、訂購洋米、以相接濟、乃事有不得不然者、苟無此接濟、則目前米價之騰貴、將已駕十九年份米價而上之、社會狀態、誠恐未能得如今日之安甯、且救濟民食、尤非其他洋貨奢侈品進口者、所可同日而語也、總之、依據上述、本年洋米採銷情况、供求正恰成相當程度、從此終止訂購、可無過剩之虞、倘復續購無度、不加限制、必致供求逾童、則彼某洋行售存洋米無人問津之覆轍在前、殷鑑不遠、所願糧商共加警惕云、</p>

<h3>房地産不景氣</h3>

<h3>銀行界主張實施國際匯兑管理</h3>
<p>金融顧問會安定金融初步</p>
<p>擬由財部徵收匯兑競銷税</p>
<p>大公社云、財政部組織之金融顧問委員會、自於本月十六日、在西愛咸斯路財政部、駐滬辦事處正式成立後、對於籌劃安定金融辦法、其第一步、即在凖備實行國際匯兑管理辦法、關於該項辦法、金融界與該會討論之結果、業由銀行公會呈請財部、實施征收匯價競銷税、以保持國際匯兑之平衡、而爲穩定金融之基礎、大公社記者、昨向金融界探詢一切、兹為分誌如下、</p>
<p>銀行界主張　據金融界某鉅子稱、自浙江實業銀行總經理李銘氏主張匯兑管理後、一般金融界均表示贊同、蓋財部前此提高白銀課税之目的、原係一時應付風潮之救濟、殊非永久奠定銀價之策、且白銀問題、又非單純的貨幣問題、而其中實含有商務貿易之關繫、故欲絕對制止白銀外流、必先挽救入超、欲挽救入超、又必先杜絶入超之主要來源、年來吾國入超之迭見增加、實緣於列國之匯價競銷政策、故銀行界僉主由財部實行匯價競銷税、</p>
<p>匯兑管理法　至於實行匯兑管理法、金融顧問會已預定三項步驟、（一）對新銀進口免除平衡税、以吸收國外資本之輸入、（二）保持現在銀價、或再提高、務使國内銀價與國外銀價、保持其平衡狀態、（三）美國如果仍將銀價提高、制定匯兑管理法、</p>

<h3>法商電車公司昨晨遭匪搶劫</h3>
<p>被刦四千元幸未傷人</p>
<p>匪向康悌路逃逸無蹤</p>
<p>昨晨十時三十分、法租界吕班路康悌路口、法商水電公司、突遭匪徒四人、開槍搶刦、被刦四千元、幸未傷人、匪徒當向康悌路逃逸無踪、兹將出事情形、詳誌於後、</p>
<p>解欵二萬</p>
<p>法租界法商水電公司買辦涂金生、昨晨十時三十分、命該公司茶役常州人秦榮生、乘該公司公務汽車租界照會一三二八號、華界一八八六號、將現欵二萬元、解交銀行、事前由該公司辦事處將此二萬元鉅欵、分裝二帆布袋、其中一袋爲現鈔、一萬六千元、一袋爲現洋兩千角、及現鈔二千元、詎車甫駛出、該公司大門、突有</p>
<p>匪徒四人</p>
<p>似窺伺已久者、當即各出手槍、由二匪將車攔住、二匪急趨上車、將其中一袋裝四千元者劫下、押欵茶役秦榮生、見勢不佳、急將其餘一袋、由車上抛入該公司大門内、匪徒倉皇中、未及再刦、遂向空開放二槍示威、隨即登預停道旁之白牌汽車、並將車夫逐下、由匪自行賀駛、向康悌路</p>
<p>飛駛而逸</p>
<p>國聞社記者、於十一時左右、趕到出事地點見法租界巡捕房、派出大批探捕、尚在該公司中滯留未去、並將匪徒逐下之車夫、押解捕房、當塲訊問、據供名羅志祥、在廣西路一百十二號好友汽車行爲司機、今晨（即昨日）九時三十分、忽有青年男客二人</p>
<p>喚租汽車</p>
<p>一輛、並言明開至法租界吕班路、來回價洋二元、余（羅自稱）奉差開出棕色轎車一輛租界照會爲一七六二五號、華界照會爲四五七四號、詎行抵吕班路西門路口、路旁復有二人上車、仍由余駕駛至電車公司門前停車、由其中一人命余稍待、見四客人均入内、未一刻鐘、忽聞槍聲、余正驚惶間、突有一客人趨至余身旁、</p>
<p>抽出手槍</p>
<p>將余逐下、余因事出唐突、仍站立一烟紙店前稍待、迨原車爲四客人開去後、正擬前往報捕、而捕房探捕隨即到來、余遂被擒等語、記者出巡捕房後、復往電車公司探詢、據稱事前毫不知悉、公司保鏢、聞聲奔出、遂即拔槍伺於二門右側買辦室前、繼欲追捕、不料機件忽生阻礙、遂未敢追出大門、匪乃從容逃逸、茶役秦榮生、乃將剩餘一袋抱回、經檢視之下、現鈔一萬六千元、</p>
<p>依然無恙</p>
<p>事後由公司報告捕房、請求追緝云、惟據鄰右某烟紙店人云、槍聲不止兩響、衆人均不敢出視、移時乃見一紅色汽車飛駛、向康悌路轉灣、該處適有交通警察司掌紅綠燈者、其時尚不知爲何事、雖握槍在手、未敢輕易開放、致使匪徒乘機逃去云、</p>

<h3>潘公展演講上海的學校教育（三）</h3>
<p>我認爲中國辦教育、自清末甲午之戰以後興學起、到今剛剛四十年、而四十年來的教育、祇辦到百分之二點四的濉圥生數目、眞是奇談、現在我們還想照已往的方法辦教育嗎、從前的辦學方法、是裝點門面的方法、人家有了什麽、我們也要來學什麽、人家有小學、我們也要有小學、人家有幼稚園、我們也要有幼稚園、人家有中學、我們也要有中學、人家有大學、我們也要有大學、甚至人家有野鷄大學、我們也要有野鷄大學、好像人家有了什麽、我們没有、是一件塌臺的事、也不曉得各級學校裏面内容是怎麽樣、因此我們根本便忽略了初等教育、這是一個很大的毛病、所以、我們今後的教育方針、不僅上海就是全國、也都應該注意到「初等教育」這個問題、這是中國「生死存亡」的大問題、不是兒戲的話、也不是因我在那裏管上海教育行政、要把教育這問題説得嚴重一些來危詞聳聽、即以工商界説、工商界中人的兒女、亦無不需要受教育、而「初等教育」實是任何人所必須經過的一種基本教育、不論何界、都非重視不可、</p>
<p>有人以爲現今的學生是很多了、假使拿比例來説、在我國、二十個小學生中如能有一個升中學的、我國現在應該有五十萬中學生、在十個中學生中如能有一個升大學的、則我國應該有五萬大學生、我國從前辦教育的以及一班學生、以爲進學校祇是預備做官的、彷彿仍同科舉時代一樣、從前三年舉行「鄉試」一次、普通一個省份、不過取了百餘人、多也不過二百餘人、有些文化落後的省份、還取不到一百人、而現在全國小學生約有一千一百萬人、佔全國人口數萬分之二三六、中學生約有五十二萬人、佔全國人口數萬分之十一、大學生及專科學生有四萬多人、佔全國人口數萬分之一、或許覺得這個數目是很多了、可知道辦教育的目的、並不是要學生預備將來做官的、假使拿這樣態度來辦教育、那末、應該儘可以關起許多學校、當清末廢科舉興學校的時候、我曾經聽到人家説、在高等小學畢了業、其資格彷彿是有如前清的一位「拔貢」、中學畢了業、大概要相當於前清的「舉人」、大學畢了業、就像前清的一位「翰林」、出洋回來的留學生算是一個「洋翰林」、他們有人這樣的比方、簡直不是同科舉一樣嗎、我所説並非笑話、就是現今、也還有這樣大同小異的情形、雖然「拔貢」「舉人」「翰林」這類的名稱是没有了、雖然「拔貢」「舉人」「翰林」這類的名稱是没有了、但大學畢業後、不是還有什麽「學士」頭銜麽、更上去、留學生不是有「碩士」「博士」等頭銜麽、中學畢業生、雖是没有什麽頭銜、但我却聽説、仍有幾個省份、子弟從中學校畢業後、族人要開祠堂門、叫他拜祖先、還要出報條、像這樣辦教育以及受教育的人、到了現在、他們竟還存有這種封建思想咧、假使我們掉過來講、教育是教人求生存的、教人有知識、教人有技能、教人有生活能力、這些知識技能、求生活、求生存的能力、那個人不要呢、所以個個人都應該受教育、至少也要受畢「初等教育」、故「初等教育」亦稱「義務教育」、這「義務教育」、有兩方面的解釋、（一）假使子女到了相當學齡、而父母不叫他們進小學校、那末公家要强迫他們去進小校、並且家長要受處罰爲什麽呢、這「初等教育」、無論何人、一定要受的、好像是一種義務、（二）我們也可以把「義務教育」反過來説、這是國家的義務、國家應該多設小學、使這班到了學齡的兒童、他們有免費享受這種教育的權利、總而言之、無論怎樣説法、「義務教育」是一種根本教育、但是、我國現今「義務教育」的情形是怎樣呢、至今「初等教育」不過祇佔全人口百分之二點四、不過、上海方面照剛才簡單的報告、各位可以認識上海教育的趨勢、雖然小學生數目與至少應有三十四萬的目的相離還很遠、可是在這幾年來小學生人數增多、這是比較可喜的現象、這種現象、我們希望牠繼續發展、並希望各學生家長與一切市民的力量都集中起來、同政府合作、向這方向去發展、不管公立私立、都盡力去帮助、祇要我們有一分力、都去盡一分力、這樣、對於國家、對於社會、對於本市、皆盡了相當的責任、因爲我們此時力量很薄、所以祇能先從辦「初等教育」努力、希望大家能齊心把這條路先弄好、再説别的、亦惟有把精力集中於一點、然後始有功效可見、（未完）</p>

<p>乘低買進者頗不乏人</p>
<p>屢見回頭結果跌五元</p>
<p>金市連朝步跌、一蹶不振、多方陸續了結、不料碩果僅存之福昌、亦於昨市斬多、以致屢破九百元大關、但因中央銀行繼續扒結先令、落手做多者亦不乏人、中途頗多回漲無泰人心仍難振作、漲勢至暫、某方於低價時猛烈購買、最後呈爭持局面、晨初以海外銀市一致上漲、匯兑微縮、倫敦生金升三便士半、人心續趨下游、塲外預備交易開出即降爲零三四元、大户即售、曾退爲一元光景、補空遂湧、而回漲至三四元、中央銀行掛牌揭曉、英美俱長、海關金單位跌一分、略形疲軟、晨開低盤、開後由低轉高、無奈内盤鬆濫、趁高賣方雲集、供過於求、惟低後頗有維持、以是雖跌而多盤、終因寡不敵衆、散户期望低價之心殊切、九百元大關卒被打破、預悉匯豐掛牌勿動、即告回升、中央來扒先令、人心稍振、而告回漲、無何銀行乘勢塞出、大户空方壓迫、匯市鬆動、套頭亦來傾售、漲勢遭挫、逐漸下游、又破九百元大關、義豐永元茂永大德成等大户猛力購條、得以維持、中央仍扒先令、尚易回漲、惟漲勢至暫、高後供源重重、大起盤旋、最後匯市又硬、再屈服於九百元關口、大户福昌斬多殊猛、而趁低維持者力量不小、挣扎至烈、收市後忽起漲勢、但因福昌繼續出籠、漲風稍稍遏止、半天市况不定、上落雖小、而起仆殊繁、</p>

<h3>證劵</h3>
<p>交割期近公債掉期交易忙</p>
<p>市價參差…漲多跌少</p>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、本月份期貨、祇餘二三日、交易較爲熱閙、多空雙方掉期交易、極爲踴躍、而以空方掉期、比較爲多、市價賴以維持不墜、而二十三關則風波仍鉅、微聞銀行方面、有貨結出、而抬價者依然再接再厲、幸本月份交易、所餘無幾、或可免特殊傾軋之風、今日起二月期貨祇餘二日、市價恐尚不免恍惚不空之象、昨日經過、上午兩盤、普通各債市、因掉期取捨之不同、市價參差、大都漲多跌少、而二十三關風波仍惡、頭盤本月份初甚平和、三月份經四號等之拉抬、則又狂漲一元半、似爲前日跌落過鉅、不得不再行拉提、次盤本月份繼續抬高一元餘、遠期又趨於平穩、近遠期相差兩元之鉅、午後開盤、各債市大都趨堅、二十三關微跌三五角、收盤高低互見、上落甚微、二十三關則跌七八角、市價結果、大都微好五分一角至三四角、成交總數、計共約一千五百萬元左右、兹將其漲跌情形、列表於後、（單位元）</p>
<p>紐約股市紛紛回跌</p>
<p>政府公債獨見上升</p>
<p>新豐洋行報告、昨（十九日）紐約股市、因缺乏需求、呈低落之勢、投機家對參議員太亭斯、韋勒及雷朋等之提案、頗感不安、太亭斯之提案規定以美政府公債作爲付給退伍士兵之撫恤金、韋勒提議對公司徵一種累進税、公司獲利三百萬元者、按其資本净數徵百分之二、獲利五千萬元者、按其資本净數徵百分之二、獲利五千萬元者、則徵税百分之二十五、雷朋之提案規定取締公用證劵公司、前日之買户於昨日又復了結、故開平盤後、市况即逐步低落、鮮有回風、較前日之最高峰、計小一元至六元光景、美元外匯亦挺、在債市方面、美政府公債上升、財部之金與非金庫劵尤佳、其他債劵則因多頭獲利了結而跌、小交易所投票呆而參差、芝加哥小麥亦跌、蓋外界需要將擴大之期望、未曾實現、多頭獲利者乃奮勇了結、全日成交一百十萬股、兹將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>
<h3>紗花</h3>
<p>紗花跌風轉厲</p>
<p>紗市趨疲、跌風重起、大有變本加厲之勢、環境惡化、銀根依然緊急、兼之本月份紗收貨問題、仍在飄摇中、致多頭心神不安、午後某公司繼續斬結、市勢愈覺恐慌、本月份敲破一百七十七元關口矣、</p>
<p>本月紗進七十七元關</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、因美棉下降、某公司之多頭、又來斬結、塲中形勢見虚、買者缺乏、跌風尤熾、各月均跌一元一·三·四·六角、午後聞金市仍疲、開盤本月份裕大限價七元購進、虚風略定、但拍至三盤、賣風突起、本月份敲破七元、結果近月跌五·六角、遠跌一·二角、查賣出明德一千六百五十包、慎昌一千三百五十包、頤大一千包、生源九百五十包、元一一千三百五十包、買進賡豐一千三百五十包、懋記七百五十包、源大一千六百包、錦昌一千零五十包、均昶七百五十包、益昶一千包、長豐一千四百五十包、長餘六百包、一日間最高低及收盤價如下、</p>
<p>現紗做開九百三十包</p>
<p>現紗銷路尚佳、查全日各帮買去統計九百三十包、行情跌半元、各帮買額如下、</p>
<p>花盤旋兩日之棉市、昨日跌風尤鋭、以金條文案宣判後、美棉仍跌、而金價敲破九百元關口、某棉業公司繼續斬多、檯面尤鬆、形勢愈見慌張、總之存棉太厚耳、</p>
<p>鄭標跌四五角</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月均呈衰落之象、賣氣殊濃、因美棉續跌、金價敲破九百元大關、發現新低峰、而其棉業公司之多頭、續來了結、致檯面籌碼、十分充足、跌勢鋭利、各月均跌三角半至四角、午後開盤、略漲一角、拍至二三盤、聞印棉暗盤回跌一羅比二五、塲中賣户仍湧、各月又跌五分至一角半、惟源大由空翻多、查賣出潤康五千一百擔、仁豐一千四百擔、大豐二千六百擔、吉豐二千三百擔、達記一千九百擔、明德一千六百擔、合興二千擔、長豐一千擔、恊成一千七百擔、買進源大八千七百擔、長豐二千四百擔、益昶二千六百擔、同孚一千八百擔、錦昌三千六百擔、泰興一千六百擔、森康二千三百擔、長和六千八百擔、慎記一千擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下</p>
<p>現花廠辦無多</p>
<p>現棉消費又轉滯鈍、廠需岑寂、來源計姚花一百包、</p>
<p>出口平淡美棉又見下游</p>
<p>昨美棉開盤、市况平和、各月跌一至五磅音、旋以利物浦消息不佳、小麥及股票跌價、三月期多頭了結、歐洲商賣出、價遂步軟、同業於跌價時買進、需要呆滯、大致等候營業前途之進展、現貨方面、本地廠胃尚佳、出口平淡、紡織業態度堅穩、收盤平疲、計現貨跌十五磅音、期貨跌九至十四磅音、英棉因金條文案之判决利於多方、市况挺秀、計現貨漲五點、期貨漲六七點、印棉因多頭了結、日商賣出七月期白羅溪、未能十分上漲、計平果兩漲二羅比、奧姆辣漲二·五羅比、白羅溪漲一·六二五羅比、原電錄左、（十九日電）</p>
<p>又據孟買電、二十日白羅溪花之開盤預測、爲二百四十八羅比半、較上日收盤跌一·二五羅比、</p>
<h3>糧食</h3>
<p>期粉後市稍稍見俏</p>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥雖小一二角不等、坎拿大無報價、當開價時、本月份開價、曾因洋麥報小、跌去一分、惟三月份以下、則以業外人心、頗轉好面、各月份之購買、亦見暢旺、是以在外麥暢訂之際、市面仍能挺住、迫至下午開盤、各月份市面、已呈盤旋、廠方雖亦陸續套賣、惟外行吃户、亦跟進不退、故局面反見略俏、至目下現粉依然軋緊、不過標凖浮多吐出、故不能帶振矣、結果本月份小二厘半、三四月份不動、五月好二厘半、六月份好半分、七月份好一分、</p>
<p>期麥保持固有局面</p>
<p>昨期麥市面上下午開盤、各月份市面、大致呈平靜之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥小一二角左右、坎拿大不動、當開價時、各月份交易、均見盤旋、照洋麥之陸續訂購、市面當無看好之理、惟目下粉麥兩市、就生産者之立塲而言、似乎麥廉而粉貴、故一有此種套頭、市面遂爲之擯住矣、結果本月份較好一分、三月份小一分、四月份好一分、現麥市面、依然平穩、廠胃亦見續　、開山東碭山麥三元九角半、高郵麥三元八角八九分、由申大去五百包、福新去三千包、</p>
<p>外小麥、廠商於價跌時購買、但無人願跟進、</p>
<p>河米大勢站定</p>
<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源仍祇二十餘號、（貨共近四千石、）市形續見微緊、到稀故耳、各貨稍起數分、然視大局、則屬呆木、各厚粳價高者加起數分近角、中市者見定、晚稻包胃北京烟台帮共辦六七百包、行情亦僅步起五分、陰變元平定之局、杜洋尖絶貨無市、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨河下各路來船二十三四號、市上各貨去路清淡、市價薄稻價修近角、客元各機廠所存頗厚、銷胃不佳、價續軟之勢、白粳高料、銷呆價疲、中段價形平定、下次者稍提五六分、其餘各價定立之格、</p>
<p>麩皮内外銷路復靜</p>
<p>昨日麩皮市面、已轉定局、因内地帮辦胃略停、東莊亦問津甚微、各廠方面、以現粉去胃一活、麩皮出數、亦比較增多、故昨市各擋喊價、仍爲二元七角半扣盤、較前無甚軒輊、</p>
<h3>油市</h3>
<p>白桐油洋莊不絶</p>
<p>内地銷路冷淡異常</p>
<p>白桐油總結帳前後、漢市洋莊稍見沉寂、市面本可看鬆、然而到貨仍未大旺、且前抛期貨、絡繹到期、致市情依然難跌、僅三月份期油稍鬆做至二十九元八角、而現油仍須三十元、均無多數可辦、最近漢市形勢依然堅固、各洋行所辦雖僅數十噸、而價格已加至三十元○三角净到、則市情之不能再廉、已可見一斑、據漢市襄桐落盤在二十五元光景、且云來源不湧、行家不敢多抛洋莊、由此而觀、漢市洋莊油三十元恐終不能進關矣、至於本埠洋莊交易、舊年一年間、亦有萬來噸出口、所靠來源、僅浙江一路、雖皖南一帶、亦由浙轉輸而來、數總不多、所以滬上業出口貿易者、總不敢多售、客冬雖曾有二三百噸之交易發現、蓋是新登塲之時、若在平時恐無此大多數之交易耳、總因浙路所産、實不足供滬上之洋銷、縱産數年有增加、而銷塲亦日見其多也、近日杭州市面足度貨每砠須售三十一元以上、然洋行辦價祇三十二元稍零、致對外貿易不易下手矣、内銷今春特别清淡、浙路爲旱災區域、無人過問、早在意料、蘇路亦不若往年之盛、故内銷之衰落、衡之往年、實不勝今昔之感也、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （沈瘦若）</p>
<p>政府明令上已禁呼舊家習慣上仍高呼的所謂老爺，在外邊偷偷摸摸地娶了姨太太。一旦進門呌姨太太向大太太磕一個頭，使得大太太不好發作。但姨太太當然是非常勉强的，一進房間，不免撒嬌撒痴的向老爺吵個不休。幸虧老爺急智陡生，向着姨太太也磕了一個頭，才消了伊的怒氣。據説這是娶姨太太的秘訣之一，呌做劃帳。</p>

<h3>泰縣的燈市</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>泰縣本稱做州、民國紀元後，纔降級爲縣的。在科舉時代，有州考府考之别。那時候的泰州，可謂揚州的亞軍了；泰縣没有多類的出産，「泰州燈籠」，「小礳蔴油」，是江南北雅負時譽的精品！因此到今日的燈市，猶可冠絶八屬；上海遊藝塲的燈彩，大都如臯人技巧的結晶，然而「華而不奢」的紗燈，依舊泰州出品位着第一把交椅，相傳每年有一隻「紗燈籠」，燃起燭來虽不見影兒的，不知給誰破了風水？纔把這不可捉摸的遺跡，只變幻成茶餘酒後的史料談助而已；廢曆正月十三到十八是春燈佳節，這般燈的手工業，一年四季靠着過活的不知有若干百人？先搆成燈的骨幹，在歲尾年頭從事糊裱工作，初五上市，止於十三，一條坡子街，由中山門到攩軍樓，天天擠得水洩不通，成了燈的陣綫，燈的宇宙；飛禽走獸，是給孩子們玩的，「冠」，「帶」，「船」，「榴」，是取吉利的；一頂明代宰相帽子，一條玉帶，一隻畫舫，一枝石榴，凑成的一色燈，充滿了封建的氣味，文人雅士，購兩色壁燈，又稱走馬燈，孔明玩「空城計」，趙子龍戰「長板坡」，都取材於三國演議；娘舅爲外甥兒購燈，父母結新出嫁女兒購燈，這是牢不可破的俗例；世有「丫頭養不得」之諺，大概就討厭這般雞零狗碎的禮節吧？遊人們看過關帝廟岳墩的屏燈，再折道燈市去買上幾色燈，直到十三賣過「老臉燈」，這燈市纔告結束，孟春夜月下，銀色散布大地，滿城孩童，燃着各式各樣的燈兒，成了燈匠變相的藝術展覽會咧。</p>

<p>茶園的東南角上疊羅漢似的堆砌着一團立錐式的人體，嘈雜的聲浪辨别不清他們在爭論些什麽！</p>
<p>「縮手……縮……手」！張大狗坐在那麻皮黑臉人稱江北老四的右方在高聲發喊，一頂瓜皮小帽在他五分之一的額部上歪戴着，眞有怒髮冲冠的氣慨！</p>
<p>江北老四把兩顆骰子提得高高的在張大狗高喊「着……吃」，末一字的班眼上摔到桌子上去！張大狗跟着喊一聲「九」！下文是一聲勁道十足的「通吃」！這幾秒鐘内，緊張的情緒封鎖着各個賭客的嘴，空氣倒是怪沉寂的！</p>
<p>「啊！江北老四又拿着個癟十」各個賭客的嘴解放了！在笑！在喊！他們的手在忙着撈摸賠出的洋錢！</p>
<p>「堂倌……絞把手巾來」！江北老四焦急着在喊，臉色黑裏透紅説不出的難看</p>
<p>張大狗鼓着張臉，虎的站起身來，抓了那頂瓜皮帽使勁拍着桌子一聯串的喊堂倌燒紙錠！退鬼！</p>

<h3>舊貨擔</h3>
<p>— 龍膽</p>
<p>據一個挑舊貨擔的人告訴我，説全上海有三千副舊貨擔；我不知這數目可凖不凖，因爲也没有人去正式調查過。不過，我覺得他們人數確是很多的，不論在晴天陰天，街頭巷尾，都能找得他們的踪跡。</p>
<p>做這行生意的大半都是江北人。他們挑着兩只平衡的竹籃到四處去收買舊貨，然後再把收聚攏來的東西挑到舊貨茶會上去出售，或挑去呌行（賣給同行的意思）。</p>
<p>「物以類聚」，挑舊發瓣也有聚會（他們呌茶會）；單就閘北來講，舊發茶會有二處：早上都在新嘉路，下午都在大統路，那里，他們陳列的東西很豐富，不論古今書畫，四季衣服，家常用具以及另星雜物，總是應有盡有的？並且他們對於價錢也很遷就，往往三五塊錢的討價，還他幾角錢就會和你成交。</p>
<p>他們對同行交易時，還用一種暗語。普通都以「口，人，工，比，才；爲，春，本，金，石，」（音譯）來代表「一，二，三，四，五，六，七，八，九，十。」十字。如言一塊錢，他們就説「口字洋錢」；三角呌「工角」，五百錢呌「才百錢」，其他不及備述。</p>

<p>胡氏扶着墻，同女兒走到程志前屋子裹來。這裏除了主人翁，還有一男一女。男的穿了短裝，敞了胸襟，胡氏這倒明白，呌做西服。那女的可就難説了，臉上也抹了胭脂粉，司是那頭髮蓬了起來，捲了許多的捲子，堆着頭上很高，倒有些像洋烟牌子上的洋婆子。身上穿一件綠色的長衣服，拖靠了脚背，在燈亮下，金光燦燦的，生平没有看到過這種東西，莫不是鼓兒詞上説的，觀音娘娘賜的法衣吧？再説那樣子就更巧了，這樣長的衣服，袖子却是那樣的短，差不多短到脇窩下來。胡氏只一脚跨進這門，手扶了墻，就把那女人看得入木三分。月英雖是懂事一點，但那裏又知道當僕役的人，見主人翁所應盡的那些規矩，所以他進房來之後，也就只向程志前叫了一聲程老爺，然後說聲我們來了。那男子倒還罷了，那女子因胡氏釘注了眼睛看他，早已是怒氣滿腔，嘴裏先咤的一聲，回頭向志前道：程先生，你就是介紹這種人給我用嗎？這女人那一雙死眼，看了我轉都不轉，眞討厭，三分不像人，七分倒像鬼，見人一點規矩都没有，手倒扶了墻不放下。那男的笑道：他不扶墻怎麽行？他那三寸金蓮，可站不起來呀。女人說着話，那一雙眼睛，已是射到月英身上，鼻子裏哼了一聲，點點頭道：這個孩子，買去當個丫頭用用，花兩三個月工夫，或者還訓練得過來。這小脚女人，有什麼用？那女人愿是站着的，説話時却架了腿坐不來，那副大模大樣，胡氏倒是看得出來。不過他的話，十有七八，帶了南方音，不很懂得。（一三八）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>造化得很，伊聽了居然立即表示贊成，使我心上頓時安定不少。而且伊還在一路走往那唱戲的所在去的時候，很有興地把這四郎探母一齣戲的情節，原原本本的説　我聽；其實我既然知道點這一齣戲，怎會不知這其中的情節？不過太后是絶對不管的，伊總歡喜倚老賣老的，很鄭重地把無論什麽裏情，當做一件新智識，新發明一般的告訴人家：而聽的人又因懾於伊的積威之下，雖　心上實在不顯意聽，但也不能不裝着很有興，很重視的樣子，默默地傾聽着。如其不這樣的話，或竟忍不住而失笑起來，那就算是大大的越禮了！所以我們都已習慣於這一種强迫的聽講，再也不會觸惱伊的。</p>
<p>可是平心論來，伊對於講故事的興趣雖像是太濃厚了，往往要硬捉人家來聽講；但伊的人才，却委實不錯，一椿很平凡的故事，經伊一講，便比原來的要動聽了許多。不管是第一次，第二次，以致於第五，第六次的重複的講述，也總不致絲毫精采都没有，所以我們有時候確也聽得很高興。</p>
<p>不一會，已到得那戲臺的前面，太后就在正中安着的御座上坐下，我們這一起的人，便照例分着兩邊，在伊後面侍立着。我抬頭把這戲臺一看，不由就暗暗的佩服那些太監的能耐。他們竟在極短的時間裏，把這一座陳舊不堪的戲臺，收拾得很像樣了；而且竭力的模倣頤和園裏那一座的格式，差不多已模倣到三四分模樣了。（二四九）</p>
<p>小食譜</p>
<h3>新春的點心</h3>
<p>— 朱</p>
<p>在廢歷新年，家家户户，因着親友的蒞臨，有些考究的大人家，在點心之外還整備着各種羹湯，像「棗晡湯」，「蓮子羹」等，來欵待佳賓；小户人家，也備着幾色點心，以備賓客點飢。因爲社會習俗，新春第一次走到人家，是不能不吃些食物的。於是點心就成了家家户户必備的食品了。</p>
<p>蘇州人家，置備的點心大約有下列幾種：</p>
<p>糕　蘇州人最喜討吉利，因爲糕的口音，含有「高高興興」和「興隆吉高」的口彩，所以新春點心中，糕就成爲主要的物品了。糕也有着幾種，像黄白年糕，切了塊，可以燒糕湯，切了片，可以炒年糕。猪油糕也有玫瑰，薄荷，棗泥，白糖幾種，切成薄片，蒸煮和炒食，都甜甜的怪够味兒。鬆糕也是怪好吃的。還有一種「甯波年糕」，白白的條兒，切做一片片的小塊，既可和蝦米冬笋一同煮湯，和猪油肉絲炒食，也是一種很好的鹹點心。</p>
<p>饅頭　因着「興隆饅頭」的俗語，饅頭就成爲代表興隆口彩的點心。新春點心中，是萬萬缺他不得的。這種饅頭，麵粉是不發酵的，薄薄的皮子，肉大汁多，滋味很是鮮美。人家在吃的時候，有的蒸，有的油汆，那是任從客便的。</p>
<p>春卷　這是人家自製的點心，將冬笋，或薺菜和肉絲炒好，然後將市上買來的春卷皮子，（係一種圓形的麵粉薄餅）一張張揭開，將炒熟的冬笋肉絲或薺菜肉絲裏在裏面，捲成一個個「百頁結」般的小卷兒。吃時須在油裏氽過，鬆脆鮮美，别有滋味。</p>
<p>粽子　這也是人家自行裹製的，有棗子，鹹肉，荳沙等幾種。棗子粽是在白米裏加幾顆棗子；鹹肉粽，也將鮮肉在醬油中滷透，然後在淘好的米裏，也拌着醬油，一同裹製，這種粽子須裹得鬆，煮得透，吃起來才能入口成化，其味津津。豆沙粽是米和豆沙同裹的，也以煮得鬆而酥，爲主要條件。</p>
<p>糰子　這是蘇州人家最考究的點心，他的饀子，共分肉，猪油豆沙，猪油蔔蘿絲，棘泥，等等七八種之多。做糰子的當兒，先將各種饀子製就，然後將米粉揉和，裹着糰子做成一個個糰子，然後放在蒸籠裏蒸熟，吃的時候，有的重行蒸熟，有的放在湯裏像湯糰一般煮吃。</p>

<h3>教育界與「學生國貨年」</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>從「學生國貨年」這五個字上，去追尋本年度國貨進行的路徑，那末，無容推諉的，在這個年頭裏，我全國的教育界，實應首先肩荷起提倡國貨的使命，向「國貨教育」的道上，大踏步前進。</p>
<p>中國年來的入超，民族經濟的日漸凋蔽，一般有識之士，本來是早已知道它非振興實業，驅逐洋貨不爲功，可是我們號稱智識先進的教育界。它對於過去維護國産的事件上，是否有過相當的努力，我記得邰爽秋先生曾説：「我國的學校，個個是外貨推銷的機關，我國的教員，學生，個個是外貨的推銷員」。這兩句話，正是針對着現實的我國教育界而言，一點也没有虚説，我們知道，自示學　中的建築　設　材料　　　用具，大都均係洋貨，以致學生在教育時代！一些不能生産，却已大量消費洋貨，假定全國學生的總數。以一千萬計，那麽平均每人每年消耗舶來品兩元，就是二千萬元的驚人巨數了，它對於促成入超激增，國民經濟破産的責任，那又有何話説？</p>
<p>雖然，緬懷既往，努力未來，我教育界若能急起直追，過去的恥辱，還是可以洗去，兹敢把我所希冀大家要切實施行的兩項，寫在下面：</p>
<p>第一，要使學生抛棄洋貨而愛用國貨，我們教育界應先以身作則，自爲表率，平時服裝，常穿國貨材料製成的制服，一切談話，行動，所用物件，務必均以提倡國貨爲原則，然後再將學校中一切的建築，設備，文具，用具，儘量採用國貨，使整個的學校中，無洋貨存留，而成爲純粹的國産消費塲所。</p>
<p>第二，應該再從教育本身的效能上，去造成學生們愛用國貨的心理，激發他們的自尊心，並知一味盲目的崇拜洋貨，是錯誤，是恥辱，像國貨教材的編訂，集會時國貨演講的宣揚，生産技能，學識的輸給，這都是「國貨教育」實行的心需品。</p>
<p>總之。我教育界是爲學生們的領導，在這「學生國貨年」中，責有攸歸，義不容辭，自更應站在學生的前面，爲國貨前途而努力！</p>
<h3>婦女的國貨標語</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>我雖不是什麽張半仙，吳鐵嘴，但是我敢斷言今年的學生國貨年，一定不會和國貨年及婦女國貨年一樣。因爲在這學生國貨年才開始的時候，婦女界已經有相當的覺悟了！現在姑且拿南京來説吧：婦女會既然通電全國婦女界作脚踏實地的提倡國貨標語於後，可知婦女們本身已經澈底的覺悟，這眞是一個很好的現象。關於京市婦女共鳴社所製的國貨標語，很多警句。現在，且抄錄在下面，希望全國女同胞們加以注意。</p>
<p>（一）婦女如能率領家人，服用國貨，就等於率領將士，在疆場上爲國殺敵！（二）婦女如果絶對不買外貨，就等於戰士收回失地！（三）欲享男女平等權利，必先表現平等力量。婦女既不能効力疆場，自應盡全力於提倡國貨。（四）國家興亡，匹夫匹婦均有責任，婦女救國的武器，就是一顆服用國貨的决心！（五）去年外貨入口，達十三萬萬四千五百餘萬元，今年應使入口减少，方足表現婦女愛國的力量！（六）去年糧食麵粉入口居第一位，總數達二萬萬七千五百餘萬元。絲織品入口達一千三百餘萬元。僅上海一地，傾銷香水脂粉達一百餘萬元。這是婦女手裏用出去的。（七）去年一年内，中國工廠倒閉三百餘家，失業工人約三十三萬人，工人及其家屬受凍餓者約二百萬人。如果婦女能率領家人服用國貨，可救活二百萬人性命。（八）婦女們！稍犠牲一點美觀吧！既可救國，又可救；這是多麽偉大的行爲啊！（九）以服用外貨爲華貴；爲漂亮；那是一種最可恥的心理。（十）浪費金錢，購買外貨，是最不道德的行爲，我們從此，就不買外貨吧！（十一）國貨雖不及舶來品美觀，但既生爲中國人，當然祇配用中國貨（十二）我們要以永遠不買外貨，教訓我們的子女。（十三）我們要以提倡國貨喚起民族意識。（十四）中國有七千萬流離失所的農民，都是帝國主義者剥削我們的結果。（十五）我們如要抵抗帝國主義者的剥削，祇有提倡國貨</p>
<h3>學生國貨年中應該注意的幾件事</h3>
<p>— 淡庵</p>
<p>今年是上海各團體所公定的「學生國貨年。」記者在本年度中，無他奢望，無他苛求，僅把學生國貨年中我們大家所應注意的幾件事，寫在下面，以與提倡國貨的志士們相討論，并互勉焉。</p>
<p>（一）希望多實做，少宣傳。—現在我們中國的任何事業，往往犯了一個共同的錯誤，那便是祇重宣傳，不重實做，於是結果便没有良好的成績，表現出來。這是一件十分使人慨歎的事情！我很希望在今年「學生國貨年」之中，大家能免掉這個錯誤，來多做實際的工作，少做宣傳的文章。那末，自然會「實至名歸。」至少，不會給人家説：「學生國貨年」不過在報紙上説説而已，這是我們應該意的第一點。</p>
<p>（二）多積極的暗示，少消極的制裁。—「學生國貨年」的對象，自然側重在學生方面，所以這一項，自然也是對學校方面而説。在今年「學生國貨年」之中，學校中的教師，負了一個重大的責任，我很希望教師們對於指導學生們服用國貨，多多注意於積極的指導暗示，少用消極的制裁。換一句話説：「我國對於學生們的服用國貨，根本還須負訓導之責者的從以身作則做起，才能收到暗示的實效。提倡國貨，是一件感化的工作，應該多用積極的暗示，少用消極的制裁，這是我們應該注意的第二點。</p>
<p>（三）大中校學生應該覺悟起來—照我的見解説來，學生服用外貨的程度，小學生方面，倒也很少很少，所以對於小學生的指導訓練，覺得容易得很，我們最最希望的，是大中校的學生趕快覺悟起來，因爲照我看來，大學生，中學生，服用外貨的程度，確比小學生要高起許多倍，在今年「學生國貨年」之中，如何使大學生，中學生，來做用服用國貨的生力軍？這是我們應該注意的第三點</p>
<p>（四）希望各刊物，多載學生們提倡國貨的文字。—關於這一點，我尤其希望各報的國貨週刊，以及負提倡國貨責任的各種刊物，多多刊用學生們關於提倡國貨的文字，因爲學生們自己心靈中所流露出來的呼聲，格外能引起青年學生諸君的共鳴與同情，在今年「學生國貨年」之中，對於帮助國貨的推銷方面，宣傳方面，也有相當的關係和需要，這是我們應該注意的第四點。</p>
<p>上述四項，僅假寶貴的申報國貨週刊的篇幅，貢獻出來，希望大家能多多加以討論，我想：對於整個的「學生國貨年」的國貨運動，是不無有相當的關係的。</p>
<h3>各國愛用國貨後對於日貨之抵抗</h3>
<p>— 吟閣</p>
<p>（一）經濟的國家主義之激化　歐戰後之國際經濟現象，其可以注目者，即經濟的國家主義强化是也。由威爾遜氏之提倡，而締結之凡爾賽條約，其中出現幾多新國家。此種國家，根本民族自决之旨趣，組成獨立國家。惟從經濟上觀之，實缺乏獨立國之要件。因欲補充其缺陷，乃奬勵國産，排斥外貨，使經濟的國家主義得以具體化。</p>
<p>美國本行保護主義，爲經濟的國家主義之國家。大戰後此主義更爲强化。一致愛用國貨，繼續增加關税，以阻外國貨之輸入。如德如法，均爲歐洲之舊邦。戰後經營之方策，一以經濟國家主義爲宗。英國雖爲自由貿易之祖國，近年經濟政策亦一變。對於外國貨之輸入，繼續提高關税。由是觀之，各國間此種形勢頗爲顯著。今説明世界主要國關税增加之情形如左：</p>
<p>美國於一九三○年輸入額爲三十億金元。所以關税爲四億八千萬金元。即占輸入額之十五％九。然經二年之後至一九三二年，輸入額為十三億金元。而所收關税有二億六千萬金元。對於輸入額占二○％。是美國之税業已提高矣</p>
<p>英國在一九三○年輸入額爲十億四千萬鎊。關税收入爲一億二千萬鎊。其比率占十一％六。一九三二年輸入額爲七億鎊。關税收入爲一億六千萬鎊。對於輸入額之比率達二三％一。即英國之關税自十一％六提高至二三％一。法國關税收入對於輸入額之比率，在一九三○年爲八％。在一九三二年進爲十八％三。日本在一九三○年輸入額爲十五億四千萬元。關税收入爲一億一千萬元。其比率爲七％三。至一九三二年輸入額爲十四億二千萬元。關税收入爲一億六百萬元。其比率爲七％五。關税所增無幾。</p>
<p>世界各國競加關税，對於他國築成經濟的壁壘，此爲各國貿易减退之重要原因。故去年六月在倫敦開經濟會議，以謀解决困難。此會對於匯兑安定問題，美國與歐洲金本位集團，意見衝突，竟至决裂。此會失敗之根本原因，因通行於各國間之經濟的國家主義，十分强烈。無法緩和也。自此會議决裂後國際恊調主義新生之芽，又被摧折。而經濟的國家主義更行激化。</p>
<p>（二）日本在國際貿易戰綫这地位　由上述之情形觀之，排斥外貨，奬勵國産，殆爲今日世界共通之情形。日本在國際之地位尤爲特殊。其中有二原因。其一日本因東案退出國聯，各國發生惡感。其二日本圓價異常低落，故日貨覺特别價廉。日本退出國聯，對於各國之經濟封鎖，並不畏懼。蓋經濟封鎖之後，其不利常在對手國，而不在日本。例如美國不售棉花於日本，則蒙其損失者仍爲美國也。故經濟絶交頗不易實行。惟緩漫的經濟壓迫，就各個問題而謀實現，如英日間之有經濟交涉，尚爲可能。第二日金之低落。其對於國際的壓迫，更爲顯著。各國對之，其反抗之程度，較之退出國聯，更爲過之。如英日間之經濟關係，有印度通商條約問題，紗布增税問題等，皆由此而起也。</p>
<h3>國貨的生路</h3>
<p>— 大布</p>
<p>或問：「怎的兩個國貨年，没有多大的成績？」這一問引起了我想到國貨的生路。</p>
<p>國貨的生路在哪裏？（一）在宣傳：近年來國貨公司的到處創立，引起銷路不小，這該是宣傳的功效；（二）在仿造：祇要到過國貨公司的人，當然看見不少的國貨，仿造的成績，可稱特超：（三）在培養研究國貨原料的人才，這件工作，應該派在最高學府的研究院，或科學社一類的組織裏；像我們的桐油，本是一種很多的出口貨，外國現在植桐，將來的收穫，便是我們的損失，我們依賴洋貨做原料，不是長久之計；（四）在創立大規模的工廠；讐如各省公路造得很多，行的工具，全賴洋貨供給，不是辦法，我們也該有一個像俄國史太林廠一樣的汽車廠，製造完全國貨的汽車，同樣也應當有大規模的飛機廠，製造完全國貨的飛機；這項偉大的工作，該由政府創辦，或官商合辦；（五）在發明：新的發明，非但可以雪我們中國人不造的奇恥，而且有向外推銷的好機會，這條雖列在最後，却是最重要。</p>
<p>這樣看來，我敢答覆開首的問題；兩年來的失敗，因爲祇幹了上面説的一二兩，其餘的都没有做到，即使末一項有事實爲證，可是那些發明家或許困於財力，所以我們還没有看到他們的收穫，眞是可惜！</p>

<h3>國貨博士香皂暢銷</h3>
<p>博士香皂爲天津中昌香皂廠出品，該廠經理史東初君曾游學歐陸，學騐俱富，鑒於香皂爲日用必須之品，而我國華南氣候熱暖，沈滌沐浴，所需香皂尤甚于他處。若我同胞悉用舶來之品，利權外溢，殊堪驚人，於是悉心研究，純用國産原料，機製各種香皂，迄今廿載，歷經政府調查農商部審查，確爲純粹完全優良國貨，特給證明書保護。該廠所出香皂，凡七八十種，無不品精質純，清香宜人，對於保護健康，具有殊效。該廠於民廿二年在滬英租界五馬路九福公司二樓，又在廣州濠畔街長豐行内，分設營業辦事處，以廣推銷，而便採辦云</p>
<h3>多絲燈泡我國青年邱伯安君之新發明</h3>
<p>— 羽</p>
<p>嘗此提倡國貨之年，青年邱伯安君適有多絲燈泡之新發明，實爲一至可欣慰之事！多絲燈炮製造問世，已歷數月，本外埠之用户，一致稱許，故營業日趨發達，出貨有供不應求之勢，憶該廠大新街發行所開幕之初，曾有人以「國貨之光」書贈，今日視之，良非虚譽。</p>
<p>多絲燈泡之最大特點厥爲經濟，蓋其製造乃合光支不一之三泡或二泡爲一，而可以先後啟用，其上裝有機鈕，能隨意啟用若干光支，故曰多絲。縱斷一絲，而他絲依然完好，仍可啓用。如係三絲，則一泡即爲三包，二絲則爲二泡，必須三絲或二絲全斷，其泡始廢。然而多絲燈泡之第二特點，則又爲耐久，絲不易斷；他泡始廢。然而斷絲之虞，多絲燈泡則不畏劇震也。</p>
<p>首批出品尚有一缺憾，即裝上燈頭之前，須將開關關好，然後啟用，未免多一層麻煩。第二批以後，則已經過改良之研究，不必先關開關，用户乃更感便利，故其營業之日趨發達，實爲意計中事，而非偶然云。</p>

<p>「可不是吃的」？陶君也問。</p>
<p>何君是笑嘻嘻的打開了紙包來。綠油油的包皮紙裏，透露出了幾瓶精美的化裝品來。什麽旁氏白玉霜啦，仆麽司旦康啦，什麽×××的美髮漿啦，………………都是些舶來的化裝用品。</p>
<p>「老何！這些東西，是從那裏買來的呀？」我問。</p>
<p>「哦！同蜜司李在巴黎大戲院看了戲，就在霞飛路上買的：我自己只是買了這一點點，替蜜司李是買了許多呢！哦！那百貨公司裏的異國姑娘，眞是漂亮呢！態度又是那麽的和藹把東西授給了我，送我們出來」。何君是像很得意的這樣説着。</p>
<p>「但是，你得知道，這東西是什麽貨色呢」？陶君拉着問。</p>
<p>「當然是來路貨囉」！何君驕謾地説。</p>
<p>「那末，你該知道，今年是學生國貨年呢！爲什麽還要買外國貨；并且，又是消耗的外國貨」？陶君又問。</p>
<p>「哦！這我知道。但是，你得要請原諒，就是在一個女朋友面前，如果不這樣的話，那是要見得吝嗇而又慚愧的事呢」！何君回答着。</p>
<p>「哈！你錯了，難道你買了這些舶來化裝用品，可以增進你倆的愛情；而到國貨公司去買了國貨的化裝品，會减退你倆的愛情的嗎？我看是定不會的，並而，有國貨可買，買了送人，那是一件榮耀而且是快樂的事呢」！陶君又説了這麽一大堆話。</p>
<p>何君是點了點頭，默默地，表示着無窮的愧悵，再也没有什麽話可辯了。而我，只是默然的坐着；心想，何君是覺悟了。於是，我打破了暫時的沉默，而説：（未完）</p>

<h3>歷史小品脞談（一）</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>文學和史學在中國是孿的姊妹。歐西學術，古來都包含在哲學裏面，在中國，一切學術則源出於史學。古今文人，很爲從史記，漢書偷點訣巧，桐城派老祖師歸有光就是一位用五色筆讀史記的古文家；章實齋也曾寫過文史通議這樣貫串性的書。不獨古文家如此，純文藝作家也是如此：司馬遷馬項羽本紀，把垓下之圍寫得有聲有色，唐宋詩人收這題材詠成史詩，戲曲家寫這題材成爲戲曲，現在還有梅蘭芳扮演的霸王别姬，頗爲時行。諸如朱買臣，王昭君。楊貴妃；之類的歷史人物，也這樣寫那樣寫，以各意識形態跟着時代變換出來。往年有人討論文學這産問題；要説中國有什麽珍貴的文學遺産，我想那决不是古文，駢文；歷史方是可珍貴的遺産之一。</p>
<p>五四以來，傳記文學衰歇下去，以歷史故事爲題材的章回小説也衰歇下去了。受歐美文藝影響的新小説，在技巧上意識上都和章回小説截然不相同；也曾有人取歷史的人物穿上新的外套，如郭沫若的三個叛逆的女性，王獨清的楊貴妃，只能説是文藝狂潮中的小波瀾，不爲一般人所注意。茅盾於民國十六年以後，也曾寫過大澤鄉，石碣那幾個短篇歷史小説，影響並不太；直到現在，只有劉聖旦的發掘是純粹歷史小諮集。近來，跟着小品文的發達，頗有人注意歷史小品的發展，上月一個女藝團體派人來看我，曾説起新興三種小品文體，幽默小品·科學小品·歷史小品·以歷史小品爲他們所最注意。這或者是傳記文學，歷史小説重行抬頭的徵兆。</p>
<p>我開始寫歷史小品，乃受日本·芥川龍之介的啓示。謝六逸翻譯的日本小品文選所閲的芥川龍之介小品，三篇都是用中國的史事：一·用項羽本紀吕馬董故事寫「英雄之器」，二·用史記尾生的故事爲「尾生的信」，三·用唐人傳奇中盧生故事寫黄梁夢。古老的故事，一經點綴，便以極新的姿態出現於當前的時代，我感到極濃厚的興趣。如黄梁夢的結尾上説：「虚生凝然地聽着吕翁的話，賞對手確切地詢問時，便抬起青年似的顔面，閃着眼光，這樣説：「國爲這是做夢，我還想生，如那夢的覺醒似的，這夢覺醒之時，就要來吧！到其時之到來，我還想眞擇地生活了似的生存：你不作如此想嗎？」這現代的精神，如太陽光那麽明朗，使我愉快得很。依着他這一枝燭光，照讀我以往所讀的史書，處處閃出新的意義來。三年前，我就着手寫這一類的小品了。</p>
<h3>懷遠小景</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>爲生活，從江南遥遠的跑到懷遠來了。</p>
<p>懷遠是皖北的一個小縣城，從蚌埠向上溯約二十五里，就到這地方了，如説懷遠是一個縣城，實際上眞一點不像樣；如果把江南蘇州崑山跟它比一下，這地方就只有一種鎮市的風度。</p>
<p>街，全是凹凸不平的山石舖築的，一下雨，走去更不容易，没有繁盛的市集，也没有規模像樣點的大舖子；晚上，没一盞路燈，也没一些夜市；一過十點鐘，靜坐到房間内，聽更夫漆黑的街頭打着大銅鑼，從破大的鑼聲裏，你可以聽到這縣城的破落的景况。</p>
<p>在那麽灰黯的街景的塲面下，你跑過一次之後，就不會想再去走第二遍的。</p>
<p>就只消上街隨便瞧瞧彼街景，已够看到這地方的窮落的情况。在一些很小的飯舖子門口的板檯前，坐着一二個菜色臉的漢子在那里有味兒地嚼一塊烏黑的淡麵餑子，那麽的生活在南方人過來眞要命。</p>
<p>然而這里大多數的民衆，全吃這東西過活，吃米飯的，那是少數又少數的上等體面人，然而還只是最粗劣的混着黍子的蒸米飯。</p>
<p>這小小的城，三面環山，雖没美景，然而自然的風景是够觀賞的，夕陽時分，太陽從山腰落下去，紅光映着山頂皚皚的積雪；看一天暮鴉，啞啦啞啦地啼着展張着烏黑的大翅膀飛回去。這時，有輕雲樣的鄉愁來碰你的心了。</p>
<p>燒一枝紙烟捲，默然坐在窗口，聽街頭閙着粗俗得厭耳的變把戲鑼鼓；細細體味這地方的生活，情景，就白痴似的想着，老中國是到處那麽破落得可憐呵！</p>

<h3>科學與文學</h3>
<p>— 伯韓</p>
<p>將文學和科學結合起來，似乎不是近來才有的話。自從十九世紀自然科學大大的發展以後，文學上的自然主義便很蓬勃地起來了，那些自然主義的作家，無疑的，是儘量運用科學的成果到文學里面去。現在我們的文壇里，重新聽到結合科學同文學的呼聲，是不是把十九世紀的舊夢重温一遍呢？我以爲不簡單的如此的。</p>
<p>看了以前兩天自由談上面談到自然科學小品文的内容，談到自然科學與文學的浸透問題，便想到這裏面有兩種傾向，譬如「關於自然科學與文學的浸透問題」那篇文章，便是站在以文學爲重心的立場上説的話，其用意是運用科學的方法到文學上面去，但是「自然科學小品文的内容」那篇文章便着重在科學的内容，本來目前新起的科學小品這種東西，是運用文學的筆墨來談科學，重心是在科學方面。</p>
<p>像科學小品文的興起，這無疑的是一種新的傾向。由於這，我們才可以説，今天提起科學同文學結婚的話，並不是重温十九世紀的舊夢。</p>
<p>但是根據内容决定形式的原則，那末，以自然科學的事實爲内容，很自然的，是要採取那種煩瑣而枯燥的形式，才能勾條分縷析的把人類理知的産品毫無遺漏而又經濟的記載出來。這就是一般的科學文字的由來。但是文學的文字是人類的生活，人類的思想，情感之具體的表見，他的内容活生生的人物，和他們的行爲之羅輯的發展。因此他具有另一種形式，那麽的動人情感，發人幽思。現在却要以文學的形式來表現科學的内容，不是「緣木求魚」的難事嗎？</p>
<p>用文學的形式所能够表現的只是科學的思想理論與工作，我以爲這裏，仍然不能不以人物的活動爲中心，而將科學貫串起來，所謂科學的思想便是在種種人物的活動之中表演着，暗示着，而科學的工作當然也不是死板的工作結果的報告，而是活潑的工作過程的描述。内容的剪取應當不是任意的把科學記載割成斷片的拿來充數，而是把重要的科學思想和現實社會連結着而文學的地表現出來。</p>
<h3>牛馬行</h3>
<p>— 西村</p>
<p>吉林的一條　名呌——牛馬行.</p>
<p>請想想這名字罷。有趣呢。</p>
<p>然　你　　想，行在　上的多是「牛」和「馬」，但是你隨後就會反悔自己是想錯了；怎麽一條街多是「牛」和「馬」行走而少人類呢？一條街，總是爲了便利交通才開闢，决不是爲了行牛馬才造爲的。於是，你第二步就又猜想着，想：大概是評論牛馬講買講賣行情的地方吧？換句話説，該是有「牛馬市」附設着的吧？是的，我和你的意見是完全相同的。可是，話又得説回來，儘管我們猜想得一樣，而且是很合理的，實際上，牛馬行的情形是完全兩樣。即使是這條街起初命名時像我們所猜的，然而，近些年來，完全没有那回事。</p>
<p>「那麽，牛馬行是怎樣一條街呢？」</p>
<p>免不了你要這樣向我發問的。是的，我該向你解釋一番，省得你對這有趣的名字摇頭。</p>
<p>朋友，你不是逛過上海的城隍廟麽，好，這就省却我許多言語上的麻煩。跟你説，吉林的牛馬行，那情形正同於上海城隍廟附近的一帶地方。牛馬，自然也不缺少，但並不成爲（市），而是奔跑着作拖車拉儎的工作的。那麽，我跟你説，「牛馬」行，恰恰是「人」行着的。把人來比作牛馬，這倒是蠻有趣的。其實，説句老實話，人又何嘗不能「比作」牛馬呢？不，何嘗人「是」年馬呢？每一個人，每天奔奔勞勞，那情形和牛馬的奔勞原是一樣的。</p>
<p>牛馬行，是一條很寛的街，城隍　廟在西南一端，不過廟廟僅只供人燒香膜拜而已，至於其餘大小商舖，都不在廟内。出城隍廟順着街向北轉，看罷：鐵匠舖，火苗與灰塵繚繞着，賣小玩藝的沿街皆是。然後是當舖，鞋舖，吃食店。再往前走，有工夫市，你將看到一羣一羣的窮人，混在一處等着僱主的光臨。他們不像是人類，倒有如一堆任人選擇的貨品。菜樓，在街中間搭出來，這裏是賣貴菜的地方，冬天，你可以買到胡瓜和茄子，只要你肯多化些錢。後面不遠，另創出一個範圍，像一個四方園子，這裏是呌作「古物商塲」的，説古物，倒是有一些，不過我不認貨，不能多説名目，但是在這「古物商塲」裏賣估衣的　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　的一面喊賣，一面踏脚板　，可是　們喊出的呌賣聲雺　有律的歌辭。你聽着，我給你寫出一套短歌：</p>
<p>「這一件好皮袍</p>
<p>五千九百三十吊，</p>
<p>穿起來可是好，</p>
<p>五年六年不退毛。」</p>
<p>接着再往北走，到北城牆南面，那裏是大菜市，早上眞熱閙。糧棧，客店很多，任他們全是作着冬天的生意，冬天四屯來城賣糧的車輛人馬都要住在這種棧房裏的。</p>
<p>一條牛馬行街，整天是孜孜不息的，往來的人馬混在一塊奔波着，呌賣聲，飯館呌座敲勺的聲，鐵器聲撞聲，耍玩意的敲鑼聲，女大鼓喊唱聲………混成一片，向各處散放，散放着無代價的雜曲。</p>
<p>在牛馬行，你見不到打扮入時的女人，你也找不到打扮入時的女人，你也找不到品茗談心的雅士，來往出没的人物儘是些比牛馬生活强不多的，牛馬行這名字所以依然在沿用着，請想想，這名字不是也没有甚麽不合宜的地方麽？</p>
<h3>搶</h3>
<p>— 丁郎</p>
<p>遭了人家的遺漏，粒粒的黄豆，散遍地上；寒風翻起了傴僂的襤褸衣裳，五六個孩子，十多隻手忙亂在地上。</p>
<p>汽車馳過了身邊，放一陣軋沙林的青烟；胸膛死抱住了塵埃，也佔不盡到自己的袋袋，恨只恨爲什麽不多破點麻袋？誰也不管這一回事，各走各的步兒。丢一下白眼，支起了漠然！</p>
<p>天只生了雙手，不然全可以把它掬來；大家的擠碰，搶不過年紀大。</p>
<h3>嚮晚（三）</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>終於走生了歆生路。靠右折了個灣。灣角上吹來一陣風。矮的急忙正一正衣襟，隨意地和一扣鈕，把長長的襯衫更往下拉一拉，腿子又短了一寸。高的竟跨上二步，把矮的搬在後面了。</p>
<p>歆生路還死要面子的，擺出那中國中埠的一個大都市的架子。電燈扭的雪亮雪亮。各個店舖子外面，用種種刺眼的紅綠的顔色——或者是做廣告的紙頭，或者是擺樣子的布疋——來裝點它們的衰老。但隔幾家，總有家半掩着門的，或全封閉着門貼上個招整的白紙的店鋪，戮破了這死要面子的歆生路底虚榮心理。</p>
<p>然而歆生路畢竟是有光彩的，畢竟是活潑的。行道上底人左挨右擠在擁。一聽到皮鞋之聲響過時，便有一大羣老老小小鳩形鵠面的馬路巡閲使，圍繞着過來。同時，「老爺！少爺！先生！」一陣帶哭帶叫的聲音，也跟着「篤篤」的皮鞋聲追逐過來。</p>
<p>那個高的底皮鞋聲在歆生路響出了。馬路巡閲使們照樣跟住了他。益發把那矮的分隔在後面了，任那矮的儘加緊短腿子的速度，但還是僅能看到浮在「頭的海」上的一個特别顯著的黑頭。</p>
<p>「媽的！」黑頭突然停止了浮動。駡出了一聲。矮的，於是加緊了二步立刻衝圍而入，又和高的駢並着，成了配當。</p>
<p>「不容易啊！」説着：「所以步行全國是不容實現的。看這情形連走完半條歆生路，也要費十年工夫呢！」</p>
<p>「媽的！最好是——」高的嘴巴跟皮鞋一同發氣，説得拍得拍得地响亮。「一個個給他槍斃！天下才會太平。這批中國人！中國人！我在日本的時候——」</p>
<p>「呔！呔！走！」立刻對面送來一陣驅逐聲。看，一個椶黑色的警察迎面走來了。他在趕散那些馬路巡閲使！「還不走！你們這些街頭的游魂！呔！呔！……」</p>
<p>「篤！篤！篤！」也是一陣皮鞋聲，威嚴而且有勁！立劾把游魂們三三四四四地趕到弄頭弄面躲了：有的且還像逐臭的蒼蠅似的，飛集到里屋弄口的垃圾桶上，抓着，拍着，尋覓抛殘的飯粒和骨骨去了。</p>
<p>「畢竟是—」高的拍一拍矮的肩。「中國還不至於亡呀！還有個把維持秩序的人哪。我在日本時候！」</p>
<p>「唔！」這回矮的却没有話説了。他似乎感到些悲哀。那個警察和自己底搭當，都穿皮鞋。走路挺有精神，挺有威風。祇有自己穿橡皮鞋！走起路來，咕咕地像缺牙的老太婆賭咒似的。</p>
<p>「然而—」可是心頭又轉了個想頭。「走路輕快却没有這橡皮鞋好！雖然我錢袋也大不景氣。但—」</p>
<p>「但咱們現在應該灣向那兒走呀！」高的在歆生路口停下來了。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>德國的桃色間諜案</h3>
<p>— 鳳</p>
<p>在上月間，日本曾發生過一件桃色間諜案，有許多高貴的女子，同戀着一個異國的武官，致不惜爲之搜索風情，秘密貢獻，結果因某一女子，以所求不遂，報告當局，其案始破。不料近日德國，亦有同樣案件發生，風流浪漫，香艶絶倫，儼如小説中的材料，其中的主角爲白格伯壽夫人，那資納夫人，業經判處死刑，眞是天下事無獨有偶。</p>
<p>據聞此案的眞相，係白格男爵夫人，結識一波蘭軍官，其人嗜賭善騎，而貌美善媚，夫人乃墮入情網，不能自拔，甘爲奔走，覓取關於軍事的秘聞，其是爲毒辣的，便是夫人於交際塲中，廣結諸婦女，縱酒爲歡，更爲介紹青年男子，其意志薄弱的女子，即與有苟且行為，夫人即於暗中攝取其影，以示其女，於是諸女爲顔面計，仍不得不聽其驅使，其用計之毒，可謂無以復加。</p>
<p>兵法曰，知己知彼，百戰百勝，苟欲知彼，原非間諜不可。我國春秋戰國之世，稗闔縱横，强弱兼并，故間諜之術，頗爲研求。近日世界溝通，弱肉强食，亦和春秋戰國時相同，故間諜的藝術，亦有神密莫測之概。孫子用間篇云，用間有五有因間，有内間，有反問，有死間，有生間，内間者因其官人而用之，故德國之桃色間諜案，亦是内間之類，因爲當時尚没有發明女諜，故孫子並未説明，不過説非微妙不能得間之實，神而化之，自在人爲矣。</p>
<p>近來各國所用間，往往用女子居多，一則，女子的舉動，關於政治性的甚少，故人不大注意。二則，美貌的女子，易受色情狂的男子所迷戀，國内的秘密，往往於不知不覺之間，容易暴露。現在各國，别開生面，竟用美男子為間諜，而使一般色情犯的女子，顛倒於軍裝皮靴之下，一任情人的指揮，這樣用間的方法，眞是無奇不有了。</p>
<p>白格男爵夫人，和那資納夫人，因迷戀波蘭武官，竟不惜將德人凖備侵略波蘭的計劃，秘密洩露，是其犯罪的嚴重性，固不言可知，被處死刑，亦屬咎由應得。惟德國此次處决二婦女，不用槍决，不用電刑，乃用利斧斷頭，實非文明國之舉動，故英報批評其「中世紀野蠻舉動的復見，」不得謂其批評之過當矣。</p>
<h3>××紀事</h3>
<p>— 炳</p>
<p>××者，道地的江北産也。是大學教授，而且在社會上有相當的地位；確實是「我的朋友」，並且還要好，眞是私幸得很。因爲我們很要好，我會幾次向他説明，給他來一回速寫，投到報上去，他首先是一味不承認，後來畢竟拗不過我，勉强的答應了，不過他說：「朋友，無論如何不要宣布姓名！」這就是××代碼妁來歷。</p>
<p>光是大學教授，嘸啥希奇，××是有特殊的地方，單單着眼到他的日常生活，描繪起來就是一篇很長的文章，材料實在太多了，這兒我只能「抉精擷華」的帶過去。</p>
<p>他的日常生活的十足的浪漫的，但他却不是研究文學的，而是教育的導師。他的住室是凌亂得無以復加，從開學到散假，床上的兩條油漬薰鼻的棉被從不曾折疊過的。書本和雜誌堆得滿床都是，不，簡直他就踐踏在書籍上，桌上也是書，地上也是書，角落裏當然更是，書很凌亂的書本散滿了整室。此外就是數不清的烟蒂，説到烟，眞好像就是他的命，他備有兩隻深深的烟灰桶，一隻置在案頭，另一隻安放在枕邊，看書寫作的時候，固是抽烟不停，上床睡覺了也總還要抽幾支。他常時説，飯可以少吃點，烟非多抽不可，合他談不上一刻鐘的話，他起碼要連抽烟捲三支。</p>
<p>然而確實奇怪，他的作息却很有規律的，每晚八點（至遲九點）就睡了，早上六點不到就起了床，這倒是新生活運動的篤行者。</p>
<p>至若談到他的日常生活以外的事，那眞費詞了。</p>
<p>他慣常説：「我們的江北話，説來雖不怎樣好聽，學倒是很易容的，祇是上海話眞不容易學，我到「這塊」已是整五年了，僅僅會「火速，火速」這兩個字。這兩個字，在趁車換銅板或是上店子買什物的時候，是非常用得着的，一説出去，人家就知道我不是鄉下佬，沾便宜不少。」</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>他的一頂草帽，直戴到深秋才不見了，有一天他的頭上忽然換上了一頂新呢帽，呢帽雖則是新，但蹩脚萬分。看過去至多是一元的貨色，我非常驚奇的盤問他：「××先生，大學教授怎麽戴一頂這麽推扳的呢帽呢？」這却觸發了他的話匣他滔滔的這麽説：「我也曾經戴過五六元一隻的毛帽，我也曾經戴過十多元一隻的呢帽，總是被人搶去了。怎麽搶去的呢？我坐在黄包車上，車夫飛奔的向前跑，一個不留神，頭上的帽子就人家一把抓走了，跳下車子去追，還是杳如黄鶴了。所以現在我只買一元一頂的呢帽戴，反而安心得多，一頂戴兩年，都還不會失掉，而且更合算極了。」</p>
<p>他的賢夫人，我不曾見過，據他自己口供，是一個典型的鄉下黄臉婆，但他却愛之彌篤，一星期他起碼有三個信給她，而且寫得最甜蜜，有一次我輕脚輕步的走進他房間，站在他的背後，他正是在寫給他夫人的情書，開頭幾句是：「×：這幾天這塊下雨，而且下得很大，因此我的心亂了，我無時不想念你呵！……」</p>
<p>因此，我也就常常跟他談談女人，這才使他快活煞了，談起來，他簡直没有止境的，得意的時候，他總是連聲的「括括，括括不得了」。可是他又竭力的表白他對女人的尊重，他説除了自己的夫人從没有調戲過第二個女人，一二八的時候，他同一個女朋友同落在一個棧房裏，那女人簡直向他撒起野來了，他都矜持住了，没有那個。也只説曾在××機關任事的時候，有一個女同事問他要墜胎的藥方，他才調戲過二三句，但也不關重要。</p>
<p>××的趣情，實在太多了，大有説不盡之概，就此帶住吧！</p>
<h3>聽風</h3>
<p>— 敬嘉</p>
<p>近來我有了聽風的嗜好，這是環境養成的。這數年我住在靠海邊的鄉下，廣大的田野裏並没有高高的山巒，因此海風可以很自由地在我房子的四周歌唱。早上，中午，黄昏，深喪，那　　總在耳膜上奏動。所以，我有了聽風的嗜好—其實即使我不要聽，也得要聽的。</p>
<p>我感覺到風的音樂是極雄壯的，也許在戰塲上的喊殺聲也不過如此吧？有時我疲倦了，我就燃上一枝烟捲，倚在窗框上，把耳朶貼在玻璃窗上，於是我就可以樂一下子，就是有悲哀或煩悶的事情也會付之九霄雲外的。風的聲音給我的安慰可眞不少了。</p>
<p>我既然有了這個嗜好，我就希望風的音樂不要中斷才好。我希望風的來臨似乎和希望飲食一樣地急追。</p>
<p>然而有一天我畢竟發現自己的自私了。我瞧見一個五六十歲的窮農夫在路上緩緩地行走，他的手是籠在袖裏，他的頭是縮着，怒吼着的風吹斷了他破衣服上掛着的破條子。立刻，我知道他是被風欺壓着的一個，而我却是要欣賞風的一個！我的確是罪惡的，我想到，風决不是爲了我該欣賞的。富人賞雪，乞丐凍死，全是同樣的一回事。我不是富人，我不該想不到别人！</p>
<p>於是我把聽風的嗜好斷絶了。</p>
<h3>桃葉渡頭</h3>
<p>— 後湖</p>
<p>桃葉渡在我一生的記憶裏，將是永永不會再磨滅的了。還是四年以前，在一個暮秋時候，萬籟無聲的月夜裏，我從一家小酒店裏獨酌過了出來，大概是性之所喜的緣故吧！雖然酒氣薰滿在心頭，就會信着脚步踉蹌地走到這「六朝金粉之地」的桃葉渡頭。天上佈滿了閃爍的繁尾，跨着秦淮河的文德橋上，河兩岸的衰柳婆娑摇曳着，似乎是陪伴着我寂寞的心靈，但是桃葉却一片也没有看見，我膽怯地扶着欄杆，俯頭看那秦淮的流水，想來因爲兩邊房屋的高和密的緣故，所以覺得這河流是比我們的城河格外見得莊嚴而深峻了，烏黑的河水，映着皎潔的月色，更顯出牠的神秘。兩邊河房的窗是關得靜悄悄地，窗外大概都有一條有欄杆的板沿，十足顯出着江南水鄉的風味，我遠眺到鍾山的披着月亮的山巓，更推想這秦淮十里以外流入鄉野的景緻，就不禁念起古人「到而今，祇有蔣山青，秦惟碧。」的弔古之詞。再想到儒林外史裏的「十里珠簾，笙歌畫舫」的秦淮繁華盛况，比着眼前的靜悄悄的人家，凉凄凄的月色，黑魅魊的河流，更那能不引起我蒼凉感慨的幽思呢！</p>
<p>趁着月色踱過了橋，向那低矮的平房堆中走去。街道是狹隘的中世紀式的，兩邊房屋的雙扇門上大都釘着獸樞和銅環，一律貼着紅紙的春聯，充分現出北方城市的色彩—雖是還是在江南—然而這古城的可愛而值得留戀，也就在乎這些平凡而古樸的地方呀！我兜了幾個圈兒，嘴裏哼着古人的名詩，要想把這勝地的可愛之處，從骨髓裏抓牠出來，並且要想找幾個當地的父老，一叩這渡頭的今古盛衰之跡，但是人家的門都關得靜悄悄地，樹上的鴟梟，怪呌得使人毛骨悚然，似是説是夜已深了。沿着河一步一回頭的走回去。途中定過一條狹長而屈曲的巷子，坊上標明「古釣魚巷」。原來這就是首都的春色無邊之古巷，自古以來，這裏就是鶯花走馬的地方，其神秘之處，正不輸於上海的「神秘之街」的北四川路，這裹包含着古往今來無限的風流韻事，但是這裹的風韻之處，却是古茂雅靜而藴蓄在骨子裏的，與北四川路赤裸裸的景象，那完全是不同的，祇得候後日有緣，重來這古巷看桃花人面吧！</p>
<h3>農村婦女的唯一岀路</h3>
<p>— 愚言</p>
<h3>早晨</h3>
<p>— 峯</p>
<p>這差不多已成了自己的習慣，睡的即使再晚，東方微明的時候，自己總會醒了過來。像自己所住的這樣的角落裏，諮來眞是够安靜的；要睡，在清晨的冷氣中本是可以安靜地睡的，然而不能；每天當烏鴉划過房頂的時候，我總會醒轉來，清晨的空氣，自己總算吸夠了。忘了是誰説過，住城市的人們没有早晨，看不見早晨的人是可憐的；這麽説，醒得早倒是很幸福了。</p>
<p>自己本不是城市中人。鄉下人是早起的，自己也便頗受鄉下的早晨，喜歡在早晨裏忙碌：尤其是在過了多年的城市生活後，特別地會愛戀着鄉下的早晨。在鄉下，早晨我是不忍着睡的，聽鷄啼了第三遍，像小孩子要起來穿新衣過年的麽地，我會爬了起來，有時還會踏着下弦月滿處走，引得村犬陣陣吠：「明月房攏靜」的滋味，我算是在早晨裏嚐到過了。其實不但是房攏靜，萬物都是很靜的，在靜裏有動，有朝氣：噎呀，是那麽富於活氣的，誰家的大門開了，在熹微中，聽得見人語，却看不見人；這些都是很使我愛戀着的，但在城市裏却没有，城市的早晨好像不曾引過什麽人的注意，甚至於城裏人都没有早晨。</p>
<p>早晨像和我有緣。自我變成了城裏人以後，城裏的早晨，我見的也還是不少。</p>
<p>我最喜歡早晨排子車或是大車輾過街面的聲音。轔轔。轔轔，轔轔，非常好聽，那聲音會趕走人們的一切邪念，會引起懶惰者的勇氣，在那前進的聲響裏前進。那眞像一曲表示海潮襲擊着岩石的音樂，一層浪衝上去了，退下來，靜下去，遠了；第二層又衝上來，又是那麽地，的的的的，音調由高而低，又遠了。每天的早晨，我的胡同裏總是那麽響着，等太陽一抹上樹梢，那聲音便消滅了。這個過後，杏仁茶的鍋蓋響，便由胡同裏傳來了，在清晨的冷氣中，遠遠地可以看得見有水氣在冒，一羣人在圍着茶鍋，是那麽忙地喝着；完了事，把碗一撂，杏仁茶才被挑到别處，胡同才開始靜了下來。一陣忙亂後的靜，常使我感到寂寞。推開窗簾看看朝陽吧，灰色的房瓦，即在朝氣中，色彩還是那麽灰；聊資慰意的還是鄰居的枯槐上浴躍着的麻雀。城裏的早晨，這樣的便完了，等提鳥籠的流氓在胡同裏唱着怪調時，要在鄉下，太陽已可晒得脊樑發熱了。</p>
<p>然而不幸的倒還是我知道早起是幸福時，我已是城裏人了。在鄉下，早起是習遦了的，諮那是幸福，那定是城裏人的話。鄉下人只知道早起，但不知道早起是幸福；城裏人會説早起是幸福的，而實際他們又没有早晨。這是兩部分人，他們的生活，許就在這地方找得出分别。我是城裏的鄉下人我知道這個。</p>

<h3>曼麗畢克馥所述影星登龍秘訣（下）</h3>
<p>— 朱同</p>
<p>曼麗璧克馥又説，一個人對於一件失意之事，不要看得太嚴重了。塞翁失馬，安知非福。她説：「有一次，我們想任用却爾斯法雷，和我合演一張片子。但是後來我們又不用了他，換了一個别人。却爾斯未免失望傷心。我將他呌了來，講給他聽，我們不用他，並非因爲他不會表演，實在是因爲另一個人的作風，更適合些。過了一個星期，福斯公司就請他和珍妮蓋諾，合拍「七重天」。他在「七重天」中，一舉而成名了。倘使我們事先用了他，或者成績反没有「七重天」的可觀哩。</p>
<p>「不要常常出去交際。你的光陰是極貴寶的，所以一切無謂的應酬，應極力避免。時時刻刻要以你的事業爲前提，如果你有空閒的時間，應當用來凖備你自己，在各方面都要發展你自己的才能，就是極小的地方，亦不可忽視。法文或意大利文，都可以增進你的辭令，使你在談吐上，得到一個更廣泛的範圍。我自己現在還學習着法文。我在不久亦要學些意大利文。</p>
<p>「每天睡眠，不可少過八個鐘頭。最好每天要睡八個半鐘頭。設法使你早晨神清氣爽，使你的健康美，在面容上映露出來。你應當將每天晚上十時以後的時間，當作是屬於你的事業前途的，如果你還没有得到工作：或是屬於公司的，如果你已經有了工作。這樣，你就不至於浪費那寶貴的睡眠時間了。</p>
<p>「一個人固然要自守嚴謹的紀律，但亦不可對於自己過於苛刻。個人的享樂，在相當範圍之内，是不可没有的。你應當看待你自己，如同你看待你的小姊妹一樣。你應當常和你自己談話，指示一切的錯誤。你亦可以自己和自己道歉，如果你做差了事的話，並且答應不再做差了。你或者第二次又錯了，但切不可連做三次同樣的錯誤。倘使你接一連二的儘着錯下去，那你實在愚不可及了。人非聖人，孰能無過。况且一個人没有錯誤，就没有進步。活到老學到老。我每天總得到些新經騐，新見識。但是有許多事情，是不用自己去經歷的，可以從别人的身上體念出來的。</p>
<p>「避免一切不名譽的宣傳。明星們的地位，不是從不名譽的宣傳得來的。就是你在卑微無聞的時候，亦决不可藉不名譽的宣傳，叫人家聽見你的名字。不然，到了後來，她終究要後悔莫及的。好萊塢有多少成名的女子，對於這點都有和我同樣的見解。</p>
<p>「你在好萊塢的時候，不可使你的思想變爲陳舊。你應當對於藝術，文學，政治等等，都有相當的了解。許多人在好萊塢居住太久了，他們的思想，談話，舉動，都被他們的工作限制，到致變成一種機械式的人物，言談索然無味。良善的嗜好，亦是每人所必須有的。它們可以給你一些新的興趣，在你辛苦工作之後，可以給你換換腦筋。這種嗜好，最好是要於你將來有用處的。譬如你脱離銀幕之後，你就可以將你平日所熟習的嗜好，改作你的職業，如同字畫，音樂之類等。</p>
<p>「當你的事業，漸漸有了端倪之後，你切不可當作你的地位已經穩定了，切不可放肆享樂。你應當照舊的努力，如同你初到好萊塢的時候。你當時時記住，你所得到的成功和報運，是暫時性質的，是瞬息銷逝的。你的收入不可完全用去。應當留一部份，作爲將來的防備。如果你每星期的收入是二十五元，你應當貯存五元。這個數目雖然並不大，但可以使你養成一個節儉的習慣，並且在你的思想上，可以時時發生一種警告的力量，使你不至於忘記繼續努力。」</p>
<p>曼麗璧克馥以上所説的，當然是對於美國一般青年女子，想入影界的人而發的。但共中所説的話，却都具有至理，凡我們青年男女之想進影界者，亦當熟讀一過，庶幾他們亦可以知道些他們人影界所必具的條件，以及所應避免的錯誤。（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「淑女懺情」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>One　Hour　Late　　—大光明—</p>
<p>作爲喜劇的「淑女懺情」，在十二小時中構成一個比較複雜的故事，這至少是使人們覺得劇的進行，確是相當緊凑的。在這一方面充分表現了美國電影的現代性，快的Tempo，明朗的調子，嘻笑的，浮面的，輕鬆活潑，使觀衆們接受了作者所給與他們的娱樂。</p>
<p>一開頭便是那般明朗的：小孩兒們的吵閙啼哭，女主人公不能安睡，失業者的苦痛便在這笑聲中消逝去了。這時是上午六時半。接上是女主人公到了電料公司，從男女主人公愛的糾纏，到女主人公的受寵若驚的被經理誘惑的過程，再加上辦公室的空氣，都是十足的表示小市民作家對於都市素描的眞摯，而這些便成爲這一影片最精采的表現。一直到下了辦公廳，快到下午的六時半，電梯壞了，使劇情突然緊張起來。可是這裏劇作者或導演都是没有成功的，男主人公的一次歌唱，完全破壞了緊張的空氣。假使説是爲了使播音臺的老板賞識一番，那末儘有機會在旁的塲合寫出，不必在這裏破壞空氣。以後快樂的結尾，更見平庸。</p>
<p>從結尾的地方看來，劇作者到底不使她和經理結合，似乎是比較可取的地方，而寫經理和女職員勾搭，對照的寫經理的妻和情人胡調，自然是有着暴露的意味的，但是到最後，經理夫婦到底和好如初，這樣一來，前面所寫的完全成爲白費了的。至於女主人公因着男主人公的勇敢，立刻覺悟過來，不管美人是否眞的如此歡喜勇敢的男人，始終是使人們覺得勉强的。如此草率，不是藝術家所應有態度。在這種地方，就表現着作者的庸俗。</p>
<p>海倫黛姬的演技，是很可以使人滿意的。她能够做戲。而且恰如其份，在前一部份將導演所要表現的完全表現出來。男主角和其他諸人都平平的盡職。</p>
<h3>評「無綫電奇緣」</h3>
<p>— 尤兢</p>
<p>Gift　Gab　　—大上海映—</p>
<p>記得在有聲片興起不久的時候，「某某大會」「某某大會演」，這類以一家公司的全體演員合演之所谓All　Star來號召的片子，曾盛極一時的。後來由於有聲技術的正規地應用，才從雜亂的拚凑，進於有内容，有結搆的聲片。可是事過境遷，All　Star的片子隨着客觀的原因，又重形活動起來了。</p>
<p>所謂客觀的原因，不是説觀衆們又需要這類的片子，而且這前後的All　Star的片子在攝製的動機上，也絶對不是相同的。前者是基於聲片技術的限制，不能不凑集一些歌唱舞蹈的塲面，以應付對聲片一般要求的觀衆們的熱趣；後者却是在此市塲不景氣，營業不振的時候，不得不明星廉價地用All　Star來吸引觀衆。</p>
<p>爲了要讓每一個出塲的明星都有戲做，又没有適合這個要求的那類故事，於是這由於不同的條件下製作的後一類All　Star片，在本質上却自然地又重蹈入前一類的舊套中——没有完整的故事，没有嚴密結搆的健全劇本，只是拚凑混集地似一碗「燴什景」而已。</p>
<p>這「無綫電奇緣」就是這類的「燴什景」簡單俗套的故事，某校高材生加伯納在投身於無綫電播音臺，做播音節目的司儀員，因同事芭勃拉小姐的垂　青而成了名，又因三角戀愛的沉迷，謊報消息而失業，再由一次冒險的行爲，恢復了名譽，地位，與女子的愛情而團圓大吉，——很閙熱地叫All　Star都出現了。</p>
<p>這兒我們且不當所謂All　Star在「無綫電奇緣」中的Valne，只須看製作者的如何處理這All　Star就可以知道這片子的成功與否了。他們苦心地用播音臺做了神效的寶貝——伸縮圈，把大量的明星兼收並蓄進來，拉長了畫面，播送着名家歌曲，音樂隊，唱歌班與大明星合演的驚險戲劇，無原則，無剪裁地繼續着。也？是聰敏的製作者也自感着這樣下去的難堪吧許於是把用慣與看厭了的賽球塲的角逐與飛機上的跳躍這些也不嫌棄地再用一次了。至於冗長與重複的Radio前之報告，庸俗與老套的Happy　Eneing的遭受觀衆的冷視，猶其小焉者！</p>
<p>自然，這裏也有不少成功之處的，比如一部份對話與動作的幽默，丑角的做滑稽相，以及綜錯的男女關係等，都是成功地博得觀衆們之哄笑的，雖然這不得謂爲全片的成功。</p>
<p>導演Karl　Frnnp處理這麽多的人與所拉扯的事情，總算够忙了一陣了。至於戲劇空氣的不够把握，乃是被决定於劇本的。</p>
<p>在三十位明星大會串中，並没有競爭地各自大顯自手。演技上愛德門羅，羅絲愛丁與菲爾倍塗等也僅是賣力而已，其餘的更是「無甚高明」。</p>

<h3>民族呼聲（Bordertown）（六）</h3>
<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>請柬已經送了出去，拉露達—「沙漠中的蒙的卡羅」—不日即將開慕了……餐費每客二十五元。那就是强尼的狡計……用意在專吸引高等人士—社會的貴族，狠狠的敲一下。果然，一般高等人士如期而至了。他們成羣結隊的來到這「沙漠中的蒙的卡羅」，由主人强尼拉米立斯殷勤招待著。他穿了晚禮服，打扮得整整齊齊地。這個時候，銀鞋一切雜亂無章的聲音，都銷沉下去了。但是在拉露達之中，充滿了西班牙的色彩。大餐廳之中，雖然擠滿了人，却仍覺得它的寛宏。樓上樓下却有賭臺，但是都設在隱秘的地方。並且還有一副小樂隊，奏著精緻的音樂。</p>
<p>拉露達開幕日的生意，好得無以復加。預先没有留座而後至的客人，幾乎連插足之地都没有。他們都要請求主人强尼拉米立斯特别設法。强氏祇好婉言拒絕了。但是有一次，他特别的通融了一下。那是爲一位女郎。她不是那個地方的老主顧，但是他却認識她。他看見她站在進門口，不覺心中突突地跳了起來。他亦認識她同來的同伴，那就是使他停止律師職務的一位貴同行。</p>
<p>黛兒埃惠爾看見了绳经不覺笑道：「眞的你是這個地方的主人嗎？」强尼微笑著答道：「信不信由你吧。」她的男伴插嘴道：「我們得尋一個桌子坐下。」黛兒將纖手插在强尼的臂灣裏笑道：「來吧，野蠻人。」强尼道：「野蠻人？你當我不會侍候女人替她們搬開倚子的嗎？」黛兒道：「不要忙。且先試試看。」她一些没有做作驕矜的意思。她和他，好像已是舊相識了。</p>
<p>他們同坐著，他們同舞著。最後，他們同坐在暖房裏，一片長窗，直對著外面的一片沙漠。這時明月高懸天空，照著一片平沙無垠，很是氣象萬千。黛兒不覺贊歎著道：「眞是想不到，你在如此短促的時期中，居然能造就如此的局面。我想，你的夫人一定是很欣喜的。」强尼笑道：「小生尚未娶妻，那裏來的夫人呢？」黛兒奇怪道：「什麽？一個相貌堂堂，事業偉大的青年，還没有被人家捉去嗎？」</p>
<p>黛兒這樣逗弄著他，他是有膽識，而對於異性是毫無經騐的魯男子。到了這個時候，他不覺囁嚅著道：「我—我—以前没有談到過這件事。你使我一時説不出話來了。」黛兒道：「不會的。你不會説不出話來的。你惟一的缺點，就是不懂做作。要我來教你嗎？好。不要太莊重了。今天是愛情之夜。應當羅曼諦克些，我的好孩子。」她説著，將手勾住了强尼的臂，頭靠在他的肩上，然後問題：「你覺得舒服嗎？」强尼説：「不。」黛兒道：「我告訴你一個秘密，我亦覺得不大舒服，心頭有些突突的。」</p>
<p>强尼給他一逗，正想　著吻她一下，忽然黛兒坐直了起來道：「有人來了。」强尼抬起頭來一看，那人不是别人，正是曼麗路克站在他們前面。她説道：「對不起，打斷了你們的談話了。」强尼很生氣的站了起來，抓住了曼麗的臂膊道：「上這裏來。」他將她領到自己的寫字間裏，問她道：「你這算什麽？跑到這個地方，來偵察我的行動？我和别人談話的時候，你爲什麽來打岔？」曼麗狂笑了一陣，然後她的身體面貌，漸漸起了變化。她雖然長得胖此了，但是面容還是憔悴得很。她的眼睛似乎看東西看不凖。（未完）</p>

<h3>Director Wang's Report on Sino-Japanese Diplomatic Policy</h3>
<p>China is Willing to Maintain Friendship and Peace with All Friendly Nations</p>
<p>Disputes Between China and Japan Can Be Resolved with Sincerity</p>
<p>Foreign Minister Hirota's Speech Aligns with Our Consistent Position</p>
<p>[Nanjing] Wang Jingwei, Standing Committee Member of the Central Executive Committee and President of the Executive Yuan, delivered a report on Sino-Japanese relations at the Central Political Conference on the 20th. The original text is specially recorded below:</p>
<p>On January 23rd, Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota delivered a speech on Japan's diplomatic policy towards China at the Japanese Diet. His speech has been seen in Japanese, European, American, and our own Chinese newspapers. Important newspapers in various countries have commented on this speech, and I believe everyone has already seen them, so there is no need for me to repeat them. Now, I would like to share with you my personal feelings about Foreign Minister Hirota's speech, which can also be said to be the fundamental policy for Sino-Japanese diplomacy. This is something that I would like everyone to pay attention to. To make China a modern nation, there are two necessary conditions: "unification" and "construction." Given the shortcomings of our past systems, such as difficulties in transportation, economic backwardness, and inadequate education, it is necessary to have a long period of peace to achieve "unification" and "construction." Moreover, in today's world, transportation is becoming increasingly convenient, and political and economic interests are closely interconnected among nations. Therefore, our love for peace is broad, meaning that not only does China itself seek peace, but it also hopes that all nations can maintain peace themselves, and especially that all nations can reliably guarantee peace among themselves. Therefore, China is willing to maintain and enhance friendly and peaceful relations with any friendly nation based on the principles of equality and mutual assistance. Moreover, this is even more so with our neighbor Japan, which has close ties with our country geographically, historically, culturally, and ethnically. I still remember that on November 28th of the 13th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1924], Sun Yat-sen, the Premier, gave a speech in Kobe, saying, "Considering the relationship between China and Japan, no matter which aspect is discussed, the people of both countries should join hands and cooperate to jointly seek the development of the future of both countries." This speech was the last speech of Premier Sun's life. All of us comrades must never forget it, and throughout his life, Premier Sun's fundamental policy for Sino-Japanese diplomacy never deviated from this. Even in terms of our national revolution, from the Revive China Society to the Tongmenghui and the success of the Xinhai Revolution, we received considerable sympathy and support from Japanese officials, civilians, and friends. Those who participated in past revolutionary work can remember this fact. From this point, it can be even more clearly seen how close the relationship between China and Japan should be. However, unfortunately, not only have China and Japan failed to demonstrate actual goodwill, but over the past twenty years, unexpected disputes have constantly occurred between the two countries. What is even more unfortunate is that the severity and danger of the disputes that have occurred have become increasingly great. Not only has the relationship between China and Japan deteriorated, but the atmosphere of the whole world has also felt uneasy as a result. This is truly something that China and Japan should both feel regretful about, and it is also a pity for the whole world. Although we are currently in the midst of an extremely serious national crisis, we still believe that given the long history between China and Japan, the current disputes can ultimately be resolved with the sincerity of both sides. After reading Foreign Minister Hirota's speech, I believe that it largely aligns with the spirit of our consistent position. Since there is such resonance between China and Japan, and with mutual efforts, there is an opportunity for Sino-Japanese relations to improve from now on and return to normalcy. This is something we are deeply gratified by. I now openly and solemnly declare that we are willing to resolve all disputes between China and Japan with full sincerity, peaceful methods, and normal steps, so as to eliminate the mentality of mutual suspicion and the speeches and actions of mutual exclusion and obstruction day by day, so that the hope of Sino-Japanese cooperation expressed by Premier Sun on that day can be realized. In short, if people from both China and Japan are not limited to temporary gains and losses, and are not swayed by temporary emotions, and instead uphold justice with sincerity and seek lasting peace between the two countries, then the fundamental problems between China and Japan can be reasonably resolved. This is definitely not only for the benefit of the two countries and the benefit of East Asia, but also the greatest contribution to world peace. (Central News Agency dispatch from Nanjing, 20th)</p>

<h3>Wang Chonghui Meets with Japanese Foreign Minister to Exchange Views in a Personal Capacity</h3>
<p>Seeking Amicable Cooperation Between the Two Countries Based on Peace</p>
<p>Only General Discussions, No Specific Issues Involved</p>
<p>[Tokyo] Dr. Wang Chonghui's arrival in Tokyo has been widely reported by Japanese newspapers. Wang spoke with Foreign Minister Hirota for three hours today. Japanese newspapers said that Wang's visit was related to negotiations on Sino-Japanese amity. However, after meeting with the Foreign Minister, Wang told a Reuters reporter that Japan had exaggerated the relationship of his trip. Wang said, "I have not brought any official mission on this trip. I am passing through the United States on my way back to my post in The Hague, so I took advantage of this opportunity to stay in Tokyo for a week in a personal capacity to exchange views with the Japanese authorities, in order to seek harmony between China and Japan based on peace and goodwill. Hirota and I had general discussions on a very broad basis, and we did not touch on specific issues. However, I feel that Japan must realize that it must redefine its policy towards China, because expanding trade in the Chinese market is its main need. The Chinese people now know that they must seek self-help in order to survive, so the anti-Japanese atmosphere is gradually disappearing. This is truly a congratulatory thing. Peace in the Far East depends on the cooperation between China and Japan, and in the current international situation, cooperation is especially important. We are willing to utilize cooperation between the two countries in all aspects. Japan's friendly assistance in this regard is truly what China urgently needs." It is reported that Hirota explained to Dr. Wang the new policy towards China set out in his recent speech in the Diet. Hirota also said that China has recently expressed a more friendly inclination towards Japan, which is very gratifying. If China can strictly prohibit the anti-Japanese movement and express sincerity towards Japan, the Japanese government will be happy to provide China with all kinds of assistance. Hirota is scheduled to host a banquet for Dr. Wang on Friday. (Reuters dispatch, 20th)</p>

<p>[Washington] Senior officials in Washington today expressed a hopeful impression that the Sino-Japanese dispute could be ended by the talks of Japanese General Doihara in Shanghai. However, they also paid close attention to Doihara's statement that border conflicts may be unavoidable. Historically, such conflicts have been the source of Japan's major military actions against China. It is still remembered that incidents occurred repeatedly in Manchuria, and Japan claimed that it would no longer advance, but the wars in Qiqihar, Jinzhou, Shanghai, and Rehe still occurred one after another. Therefore, at least in official circles, Doihara's optimistic remarks are not yet believable. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

<h3>After the American Gold Clause Case Verdict</h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>The American gold clause case. Ever since the Washington Supreme Court accepted the trial on January 8th. The whole country, both government and the public, have paid extremely close attention. Because the Supreme Court's ruling on this case. Could influence Roosevelt's monetary policy. And this monetary policy is also the main part of the recovery movement. Observing that the Supreme Court did not make a ruling after the debate ended on January 11th. And the government urgently prepared countermeasures before the verdict. To prevent the verdict from being unfavorable to the government. It can be seen that this lawsuit is of great importance. Now this lawsuit has been formally ruled by the Supreme Court the day before yesterday (February 18th). The verdict is divided into two parts. The first is to acknowledge that the gold clause on private bonds is invalid. The second, although it acknowledges that government debts must still be fulfilled according to the gold clause. But if the government does not fulfill it. The creditor may not sue the government in court. To recover losses.</p>
<p>If we want to understand the implications of this case. We must first understand the course of this case. And where its importance lies. Tracing back to 1816, American public and private bonds all included a clause. Stipulating that when repaying debts, gold coins should be used, or other currency with a value equal to gold coins. This is the origin of the gold clause. This kind of provision. Can make the original rights and obligations between creditors and debtors. Not affected by changes in currency value. This provision has been in use for many years. Has become a convention. When President Roosevelt took office in 1933. Just as the United States was experiencing a financial panic. The Congress, in order to relieve the crisis. And to reform the finances. Therefore, on April 19th of that year, it announced the suspension of the gold standard. At the same time, the provisions of the gold clause. Also declared invalid. On June 5th, after President Roosevelt's signature. Became a law. After the gold clause was abolished. Domestic public opinion. Criticisms arose. Some even thought it was unconstitutional. Because it is contrary to the spirit of American law prohibiting states from using legislation to change contractual obligations. On January 31st, 1934. The government issued a currency devaluation decree. Reducing the weight of the U.S. dollar from 25.8 grams to 15 and 21/100 grams. That is, one new U.S. dollar and sixty-nine cents is only worth one old U.S. dollar. According to the provisions of these two laws. The losses suffered by American creditors are extremely significant. The gold clause case was a fierce opposition from creditors who suffered such losses. The plaintiff in this case. Is Norman, a bondholder of the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad Company. The defendant is the railroad company. On February 1st, 1930. The plaintiff purchased $1,000 in bonds from the defendant. Interest rate of 4.5%. Paid every six months. And with a gold clause attached. Norman duly requested interest from the defendant on February 1st, 1934. The defendant refused to fulfill the gold clause on the grounds of the laws of June 5th, 1933, and January 31st, 1934. Leading to litigation in the New York court. The plaintiff lost the case. So appealed to the Supreme Court. At the same time, there were three other similar lawsuits filed with the Supreme Court. All arising from this law. Seeking justice from the Supreme Court.</p>
<p>Legally speaking. The government's abolition of the gold clause law. Not only is it suspected of being unconstitutional. It also denies the gold standard law of 1900. The Second Liberty Bond Act. And all laws concerning the issuance of public bonds. Because these laws all recognize the gold clause. Before the verdict was announced. Everyone believed that the Supreme Court would act in accordance with the spirit of judicial independence. To protect the interests of creditors. Issuing a ruling unfavorable to the government. Observing that European countries were competing to sell off pounds and francs. Buying U.S. dollars. And the Chief Justice of the U.S. Supreme Court, Hughes, during the hearing of the case on January 8th. Also said, "Where did the government get the authority to change the gold repayment of freedom public debt?". The aspirations of the people. Can be seen here.</p>
<p>Finally, we should have a clear understanding of the impact of the Supreme Court's verdict on the United States and the world. The London exchange market has reversed. Those who were selling francs and pounds to buy U.S. dollars. All reversed their previous state. The price of the franc against the U.S. dollar. Rose sharply. And in the New York market. Stock prices have soared. This situation. Some may see it as a gain from Roosevelt's currency devaluation policy. Not knowing that this is the opportunism of speculators. Caused by this. Not the market activity caused by the devaluation of the U.S. dollar.</p>
<p>If we talk about the impact of international lending relations. Then China and other debtor countries that owe U.S. debt. If this verdict is cited. To repay the old U.S. debts with the already devalued U.S. dollars. The United States will suffer a major loss. I don't know if the U.S. government is willing to accept this loss. Or have other countermeasures. This is also a noteworthy issue.</p>

<h3>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Issues a Letter to Compatriots Nationwide</h3>
<p>In Commemoration of the New Life Movement's Anniversary</p>
<p>[Nanchang] Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, in commemoration of the anniversary of the New Life Movement, issued a letter of respect to compatriots nationwide. The original text is as follows: "The New Life Movement is actually the foundation of a new life for our Republic of China. Its purpose is to establish the rules of daily life, food, clothing, housing, and transportation for the people with the inherent virtues of our nation, namely propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame. It aims to promote inner construction through external training. This is an extremely ordinary movement, and it is also an effective remedy for the current environment and state of illness of our nation. Since it was initiated in Nanchang on February 19th of last year, it has been a year to this day. In order to review the past, encourage the future, and achieve the above-mentioned goals, I would like to reiterate its main points and point out the path for continued efforts, so as to encourage all my compatriots nationwide. When this movement was initiated last year, due to the eagerness of our people to seek national rejuvenation, the whole country responded and various places followed suit. The speed of progress was unprecedented. However, because the initial organizations in various places were diverse, the theories were not entirely the same, and the methods of promoting the movement were even more divergent and unfocused, lacking any standards, the Outline of the New Life Movement was formulated in May to explain the meaning in detail and stipulate the procedures. The New Life Movement General Association was established in Nanchang on July 1st, stipulating the organizational outline, reorganizing the New Life Movement associations in various places across the country, and showing the norms for progress, gradually advancing in stages, step by step, starting from oneself and extending to others, from the shallow to the deep, from things that do not cost money, time, or effort, and then to the rest, starting from organs, groups, schools, and public places, and gradually extending to the entire society, first using the two items of order and cleanliness as the central work of the first phase of the movement. Thus, from a state of free development, it progressed to a path of neatness and uniformity. Looking back on this year, although the achievements and progress in various places across the country have not been able to fully meet our expectations, fortunately, thanks to the unanimous respect and vigorous efforts of all virtuous people and compatriots nationwide, the perception of this movement, the awareness of order and cleanliness, has been able to penetrate into the hearts of the people, gradually forming a trend and creating a considerable foundation. This is indeed something that can be cited as infinite comfort. However, the effort devoted to the two items of order and cleanliness is only the preliminary work of this movement, hoping to use this as a starting point to correct the outdated life methods of our people. Now, in order to adapt to the needs of our nation and develop the life of our nation, it is essential to go a step further and realize the three major principles of militarization, productionalization, and artisticization shown in the new connection outline in the entire daily life of our compatriots, otherwise it will be in vain. The so-called militarization is not to arm all our compatriots and go to the frontiers together, but only to hope that they will emphasize organization, unity, strict discipline, order, know how to be invigorated, and maintain seriousness, so as to wash away the previous habits of disorder, romance, shirking responsibility, following conventions, and seeking temporary comfort. The so-called productionalization of life is not to have all our compatriots become farmers or workers, or to be engaged in commerce, but only to hope that all our compatriots can be thrifty, hardworking, mindful of the difficulty of material resources, and self-reliant in order to engage in the path of labor production, so as to wash away the previous habits of extravagance, waste, laziness, wandering, and greed. The so-called artisticization is not to have all our compatriots imitate the actions of poets, hackers, painters, and musicians, but only to hope that their personal conduct, dealings with others, and handling of affairs can be solemn, respectful, orderly, clean, lively, humble, quick, and reliable, so as to wash away the previous habits of crudeness, vulgarity, narrowness, ignorance, frivolity, and hypocrisy. If the above-mentioned three principles can be practiced and implemented one by one, and diligently learned without changing, then the four conditions of "propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame" will be fully met. If the life of one person is like this, then that person will surely be diligent and promising. If the life of one nation is like this, then that country will surely be rich, strong, and prosperous. Now, in order to enable all my compatriots nationwide to realize the spirit of these three types of life, the specific methods are: first, the training and organization of the people should be implemented; second, the organization of social cooperative undertakings should be promoted; and third, the popularization of various social educations should be intensified. All those in various places who are responsible for advocating the New Life Movement should immediately organize labor service groups separately, formulate plans properly according to the above methods, go deep into the people, and work hard to guide them. The organization of these service groups should be based on public officials, school teachers and students, and leaders of various industries, using their spare time, class breaks, after-work hours, or other holidays to engage in work, be the first to labor, be self-strengthening, and never slacken. Taking on the responsibility of educating and transforming the people, the New Life Movement will be more practical and will also be in line with the original intention of progressing from the shallow to the deep, from oneself and extending to others. The foundation of our revitalized nation will naturally be consolidated from this. Compatriots and gentlemen, please strive together!

<h3>The Course of the Murder of American Missionary Mr. and Mrs. Standahl</h3>
<p>The Magistrate of Jingde County Gave a Warning in Advance</p>
<p>Four Murderous Bandits Have Been Executed on the Spot</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The details of the murder of American missionary Mr. and Mrs. Standahl in Jingde, Anhui, have been published in various Chinese and foreign newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai, but the details are fragmented and not detailed, and there are some inaccuracies. Here is a reliable message obtained from relevant parties, which is recorded as follows: Jingde is located in a remote area of ​​southern Anhui, adjacent to the borders of Jiangxi and Zhejiang, in the midst of towering mountains and ridges. The transportation is extremely inconvenient, and there are no telegrams or telephones to transmit news. The communist bandits who broke through from Jiangxi and fled north first fled to Changhua, Zhejiang, and were defeated by the national army. As a result, they fled back to southern Anhui, and after being blocked by the central army everywhere, they detoured to attack Jingde in an attempt to flee north. Jingde had no people's self-defense forces, and because it happened suddenly, the few were no match for the many, so it fell on December 6th of last year. However, the national army attacked and suppressed the enemy step by step. The day of the fall was the day the county town was recovered by the pursuing army. Later, it was learned that an American missionary had been captured. In order to do its best to rescue foreigners, it advanced at an accelerated pace and pursued the enemy to Miaoshou. After a fierce battle for four hours, the communist bandits were finally driven back. Unfortunately, the missionary couple had already been killed at that time. After the Red bandits withdrew from Miaoshou, a fellow Christian, Luo Kezhou, ventured to go there on the 9th and found the remains of Mr. and Mrs. Standahl. He immediately joined the bandit suppression officials and the local Lianbao director to purchase good coffins for burial, and rescued the Standahl's daughter at the home of Wang Baozhang in the area. Later, she was sent to Jinan to be raised in the home of Shi Jinchen, the father of Mrs. Standahl. When Missionary Standahl arrived in Jingde in September of last year, Peng Shuhuang, the magistrate of the county, had told him that although Jingde was currently peaceful, communist bandits from the neighboring Huizhou area and Chunsu and other places in Zhejiang often came to harass them, and advised him to wait until next spring to come again. However, Missionary Standahl was enthusiastic about preaching, so he returned to Wu and brought his family to Jingde. The local officials then told him that he could only stay in Jingde temporarily, and that he would be notified in advance if there was any police news. On the morning of December 6th, at 6:00 AM, the communist bandits fled to Yangxi Station. At 7:00 AM, Magistrate Peng sent Zhang Zuwu, Chairman of the South Association, to the Gospel Church to instruct the Standahl couple to leave the country immediately. At about 8:00 AM, he sent He Gaoxuan, the quartermaster of the security team, to urge them to leave quickly. The protection was not inconsiderate. However, the missionary was determined to preach and did not want to break his promise to his fellow Christians, so he delayed his departure and eventually met with disaster. Later, the national army continued to pursue the enemy and the communist bandits in southern Anhui were investigated for the murderers. On December 14th, Wang Yaowu's brigade pursued the enemy to Tanjiabiao and engaged in a fierce battle all day, killing more than 400 bandits and capturing more than 100 bandits. The captured bandits were interrogated one by one, and Nan Aifeng, Jiang Bingfu, Zhu Maotou, and Hong Sanyuan confessed that they had participated in the murder of the American missionary couple in Miaoshou. After being interrogated by the Military Law Office of the Anhui Provincial Government Chairman's Office, it was confirmed that they were the murderers in this case and sentenced to death. They were executed on the spot on the 22nd to serve as a warning. It is heard that about 40 local officials and people were killed in the fall of Jingde this time, and dozens more were kidnapped. At that time, Peng Shuhuang, the magistrate of Jingde County, was dismissed and replaced by another person because the provincial government held him responsible for protecting the local area, even though the transportation was inconvenient, the bandits were numerous, and he was caught off guard.

<h3>National Treasury Revenue Increases Sharply After Post Offices Sell Stamp Tax Tickets on Behalf</h3>
<p>More Than Doubled in Peiping</p>
<p>[Nanjing] It has been three months since the financial authorities changed to selling new pagoda-style stamp tax tickets through post offices in various places. A Central News Agency reporter asked a responsible person from the Ministry of Finance on the 20th to inquire about everything to see what the benefits and harms of implementing this new system are. According to reports, the results obtained since the trial implementation, except for the number of tickets sold in remote provinces which decreased, all other provinces have increased compared to before, especially in various cities, which have increased by more than double. For example, in Peiping, the monthly average was more than 17,000 yuan, which increased to more than 28,000 yuan in November of last year, and increased to more than 39,000 yuan in December. The average monthly sales for the two months was more than 34,000 yuan. In addition, the average monthly sales of tickets in the ten provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Fujian, Hubei, Henan, Shandong, Hebei, and Chahar, and the four cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Peiping, and Qingdao, was more than 580,000 yuan. In November, the total sales were more than 515,000 yuan, and in December, it was more than 534,000 yuan. Although it decreased by more than 50,000 yuan, the previous stamp tax bureau spent 20% of the total income, and the national treasury actually received only more than 470,000 yuan. Now, the post office sells on behalf, and the handling fee is only 6%. Based on the average for November and December, the national treasury can actually receive more than 490,000 yuan per month, an increase of more than 20,000 yuan compared to before. Such results were achieved at the beginning of the implementation of the new method. In the future, everything will be on track, and the tax revenue is expected to increase further. The reasons for this are: one is that the provinces and counties are conducting serious inspections, and the other is that the previous practice of forced apportionment has been abolished. As for the remote provinces, the commercial depression and the number of tickets sold are not large. In short, under the old system, the national treasury's income from ticket sales was not much, and the innocent losses suffered by merchants and people were very large. After the implementation of the new system, the national treasury's tax revenue has increased and the burden on the people has been greatly reduced. This has been achieved in terms of administrative efficiency, and the future is optimistic. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 20th)</p>

<h3>Diverse Opinions Among Countries on the Regulation of Arms Trade</h3>
<p>[Geneva] The Arms Manufacturing and Trade Management Committee of the League of Nations Disarmament Conference met again today, but the opinions of the delegations from various countries are still far apart and difficult to reconcile.

During the debate, it was discovered that on the issue of arms imports and exports, France intends to treat civilian aircraft and their parts as the same as military aircraft, while the United States argues that there should be a distinction between the United States and continental Europe on this point. In addition, the intention of the United Kingdom is to formulate a more complete list of categories beyond those listed in the US draft. The opinion of the Soviet representative is even more advanced than that expressed by France, not only should aircraft parts be regarded as military supplies, but all raw materials for manufacturing chemical warfare and gunpowder, such as sulfur, should also be included in military supplies.

<h3>Anglo-French Talks Again, London Agreement To Be Upheld</h3>
<p>Suggestions Are Interrelated</p>
<p>Complete Consensus Between the Two Countries</p>
<p>[London] According to reliable sources, although the negotiations evoked by the London Declaration are a major topic in today's cabinet meeting, a definite resolution may not be clear by the end of this week. However, the second step is bound to be another joint note issued by Britain and France, acknowledging that Britain and Germany can negotiate directly, but the issues discussed should not be limited to the Air Pact, but should cover all agreements in the London Declaration. The press here believes that Simon seems to have the possibility of going to Berlin. (National Telegram on the 20th)</p>
<p>[London] Germany's reply to the suggestions jointly put forward by Britain and France supports the conclusion of a treaty by the major European countries. The British cabinet will also meet tomorrow to consider it, and then the two countries will exchange views. It is generally believed that although the British and French authorities believe that the Air Pact is an issue that must be discussed immediately, they do not think it appropriate to only stipulate that agreement while disregarding the other sections mentioned in the suggestions. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Studies German Reply</h3>
<p>[Paris] The Joint Committee of various departments of the British Cabinet on disarmament issues held a meeting to review the German reply of February 17. It was believed that the various suggestions contained in the Anglo-French London Declaration of February 3 are interconnected with each other and form a whole problem. The countries concerned should not focus on one point while ignoring the other points. This view is completely in line with the French government's opinion. Therefore, what Britain and France should reply to Germany before Britain and Germany conduct talks, the content has already been agreed, and what has not been decided is only a matter of form, and the secondary issue is whether the reply should be made jointly by the two countries, or only state that the letter has been received. It is heard that British Foreign Secretary Simon will come here before the 20th of this month to meet with Foreign Minister Laval, at which time a decision will surely be made. It seems that Britain and France will delay until the beginning of March to reply to Germany, and the meeting of British and German dignitaries will also be postponed until after Foreign Secretary Simon visits France. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>British Newspapers Express Opinions</h3>
<p>[London] The Times made some suggestions regarding the implementation procedure of the Anglo-French London proposal of February 3, roughly saying that we can negotiate with Germany on the Air Pact as much as possible, but we must wait for other issues (referring to Germany's return to the League of Nations, general disarmament treaty, Eastern European mutual assistance treaty, and Danube River treaty) to obtain the consent of the countries concerned before signing. For the current plan, it is appropriate to start re-establishing partial compromises in order to gradually realize the entire compromise. The overall relief plan cannot be accomplished overnight. The best way is for Britain to send someone to Berlin. Germany has the right to demand "equal negotiations" and will eventually get equal negotiations. Rather than letting Germany repeatedly demand concessions and other countries reluctantly making concessions, why not directly allow it with a friendly attitude? The News Chronicle believes that the Soviet Union and the Little Entente countries are very concerned about the Eastern European mutual assistance treaty and are very willing to see it established. It agrees with The Times that it should negotiate directly with Germany, because Germany's return to Geneva is a major issue. The Daily Herald also holds the same view, saying that if the Anglo-French plan is to succeed, all parties must negotiate freely on an equal footing. If each country or a certain group of countries puts forward conditions and forces people to recognize them, then the entire plan will inevitably be in danger. (Havas dispatch on the 20th)</p>
<h3>Laval Attends Cabinet Meeting to Report on Anglo-French Talks</h3>
<p>[Paris] Today, Foreign Minister Laval reported at the State Council the situation of the continued talks between Britain and France after the German reply was sent. Political figures are doing their best to keep silent about Laval's report. It is now learned that after French Ambassador to the United Kingdom Corbin met with British Foreign Secretary Simon, he telegraphed a report to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is rumored that the United Kingdom sent a note to the French government, which is probably a false rumor. In fact, the United Kingdom did not send a note. In addition, some newspapers reported that Italy suggested to Britain and France to convene a meeting of the ambassadors of the five countries, Britain, France, Italy, Germany, and Belgium, related to the Air Mutual Assistance Treaty, which is also not true. Generally speaking, the State Council did not make any decision today.</p>
<p>Always Upholding the Agreement</p>
<p>As for the recent exchange of views between Britain and France, it is only about the procedural issues caused by Germany's request to hold individual talks with Britain. In short, the British and French governments fundamentally uphold the London Agreement of February 3. No matter what decision the British government leaders make regarding the demands put forward by Germany, the French authorities express their approval, because of this reason. If the Anglo-German talks that Berlin hopes for can promote the resolution of various outstanding issues, then France will be very happy. Therefore, the goal of the current Anglo-French talks is very limited, that is, to determine how the two governments' reply to Germany should be worded and what the scope should be.</p>
<p>No More Than Two Ways to Reply to Germany</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the reply of Britain and France to Germany will not exceed two ways: either only express acceptance of Germany's request to hold direct talks, and not mention the rest of the issues, and try to raise and discuss them in detail during the direct talks with Germany, or give a true reply to the various basic points of the German letter and reiterate the Anglo-French Agreement of February 3. It is not yet known what kind of decision Britain and France will make, but the ultimate goal currently attempted is to seek peace in Europe under a system in which all countries uniformly obtain security. The goal pursued by British diplomacy is naturally no more than this. (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>Divisive Tricks in Vain</p>
<p>[Paris] According to "Le Petit Parisien," Foreign Minister Laval's report at the State Council yesterday on the progress of the Anglo-French Ministry of Foreign Affairs talks after the German reply was sent clearly expressed satisfaction, saying that the current Anglo-French talks are proceeding smoothly without obstruction. The methods put forward in the German reply not only failed to achieve the purpose of alienating Britain and France, but instead aroused the opposite effect. Britain seems to have the same view as France, believing that the issue of the Air Mutual Assistance Treaty should not be separated from other issues in the London Declaration (referring to Germany's return to the League of Nations, general disarmament treaty, Eastern European mutual assistance treaty, and Danube River treaty, which were not mentioned in the German reply). As for the procedural issues of future negotiations, France will entrust Britain to freely adopt decisions. However, "L'Écho de Paris" said that Germany has violated important international treaties, which is something we should not forget. If Britain changes its original opinion, then France will no longer be able to listen to Britain's representation of France to take responsibility for negotiations with Germany.</p>
<p>Britain Notifies the Soviet Union</p>
<p>According to "L'Intransigeant," since the Anglo-French London talks, Germany has repeatedly attacked the Soviet Union, and Britain has notified the Soviet government of the results of the exchange of views between Britain and France, and said that Britain and France take a consistent attitude on all issues. This kind of notification from Britain to Russia may be regarded by Germany as clear evidence that Britain approves of the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Treaty in spirit. (Havas dispatch on the 22nd)</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador to the UK Declares that Security in Both Eastern and Western Europe Should Be Taken Into Account</h3>
<p>[London] Russian Ambassador to the UK Maisky recently issued a declaration, stating the Soviet Union's views on the London Declaration of February 3, which has attracted considerable attention. Maisky's declaration said, "If there is no security and peace in Eastern Europe, then security and peace in Western Europe cannot exist. All parts of the European continent should obtain security at the same time. This section has been stated very clearly in the Anglo-French declaration. In the current mutually involved European situation, if someone advocates first seeking security in Western Europe and disregards security in Eastern Europe, then that person is either ignorant or harbors malicious intentions. It is appropriate for Eastern European countries to be alarmed by this. As for the Air Mutual Assistance Treaty, its purpose is to resist sudden attacks in Western Europe. It is purely a regional mutual assistance treaty with the same basis as the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Treaty. It is a good tool for preventing invasion, but it must be established at the same time as the Eastern European treaty in order to guarantee the peace of the entire Europe. In short, the security and peace of Europe, whether it succeeds or fails, will depend on the success or failure of the Eastern European treaty." (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3>British Cabinet Member Sent to Berlin, German Political Circles Eagerly Await</h3>
<p>[Berlin] The German government is eagerly looking forward to a British cabinet member coming to Berlin to talk directly with the German government to discuss the various points suggested in the London Declaration. German political figures hope that Britain will send someone to Germany, as this move is really related to Germany's prestige. German newspapers are now making this kind of argument. "Berliner Tageblatt" said, "Hitler is in charge of Germany's major policies. If a British representative comes to Germany to negotiate with Hitler, then he will be able to understand the situation of the new Germany more." "Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung" said, "Foreign negotiators must now meet with Hitler face-to-face, because the stage of exchanging diplomatic notes has now passed. Since the relationship between the various issues is so important, it is really necessary for the main figures of the various countries to meet once." (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>

<h3>After the US Gold Clause Case Judgment</h3>
<p>The Government Will Ask Congress to Legislate to Eliminate Disputes</p>
<p>Obstacles to Monetary Policy Removed, Silver Faction Active</p>
<p>[New York] The US Treasury Department expressed its opinion that since the cash clause case has ended, the government will proceed with its financial procedures in mid-March, and issue new bonds to replace the bonds that are about to expire. Attorney General Cummings stated today that a legislative act to protect the government based on the gold clause case ruling is not extremely important, but can be regarded as a move to end this dispute. In the future, the opportunity to sue the government no longer exists, but after studying the situation, establishing a kind of law to eliminate all kinds of disputes forever is also a good thing. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Attorney General Cummings announced today that the government may ask Congress to pass a bill as soon as possible to consolidate the victory the government won after the Supreme Court declared the gold bond case. After consulting with President Roosevelt at the White House, Cummings said that the purpose of this bill is to prevent continued lawsuits against the government in American courts. The case is still under discussion. Holders of Liberty Bonds have declared that they have suffered heavy losses after the dollar was devalued. The purpose of the case is to prevent these people from suing the government in court. Some legal scholars have stated that the Supreme Court's ruling has not closed the door to this litigation. Observers with vision stated today that the Supreme Court's ruling determines two paths. Future governments must choose one of them. The two paths are (1) all gold should continue to be stored in the treasury, so that the policy of large-scale devaluation of paper money can be sustained, and (2) allow gold to circulate in the market, so that the dollar can restore its previous gold price. However, government spokespersons feel that the obstacles to the progress of monetary policy have now been removed. The New Deal faction is now planning to raise prices and stabilize the value of the US dollar at home and abroad. In the past, it was rumored that an international monetary conference would be convened, but today it was learned that the Supreme Court's ruling has removed the obstacles for the United States to participate in the conference. It is said that the Treasury Department's current plan aims to fix the current dollar value. The government is prepared to curb the abnormal development after the gold bond case was declared, so as to avoid repeating the unpleasant incidents that occurred between June and July 1933. It is learned that the 1933 gold case stipulated that the devaluation limit was 50%. This Supreme Court ruling recognizes that President Roosevelt can manipulate the dollar within this limit. The dollar has now been devalued to 59 cents, so once currency becomes a serious issue for international discussion, there are still 9 cents left for negotiation with foreign countries. Well-informed sources claim that Treasury Department officials are now planning the future steps in the government's currency plan, and raising prices and restoring credit are their current goals. At the same time, the Securities Exchange Commission is still closely monitoring the securities trading market, and is prepared to suspend trading if the market price fluctuates too much. (National Telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>[New York] James, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania, said that the gold clause issue may still have future developments. Yesterday's Supreme Court ruling cannot prevent foreign governments holding US government bonds from demanding that the US$100 bonds with gold clauses be paid with the current low-value currency of US$169. Private bondholders will also inevitably take this opportunity to transfer all their bonds to foreign governments. However, people in Washington believe that even if foreigners holding bonds ask their government to make this request, it will be invalid, because the bonds are purely domestic debts and are not within the scope of international law. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>[Washington] Legal experts in Washington predicted today that the Supreme Court's gold clause ruling may allow American citizens residing in other countries who hold government bonds to sue the government, demanding compensation for losses, because overseas Americans may be able to provide evidence that they have indeed suffered losses due to the devaluation of the dollar and the abolition of gold clause payments. These people purchased bonds before the dollar was devalued, and now they have moved abroad, and the purchasing power of the dollar has been greatly reduced, and the losses are naturally not small. However, the number of such people is very small. Treasury Department officials expressed indifference today. As for foreigners who purchase US bonds, they are not allowed to demand compensation, because the US government issued bonds for the purpose of having the American people buy them. Foreigners who invest are naturally treated equally, and they can never demand compensation because the exchange rate between the dollar and their national currency has changed. (National Telegram on the 19th)</p>
<p>[Paris] France has officially decided not to demand that the United States pay cash in accordance with the original terms of the bonds. All leading banks, such as the Bank of France, have been ordered to reject requests for compensation from people holding US bonds. (National Telegram on the 20th)</p>
<h3>US Inflation Faction's Movement to Recoin Silver</h3>
<p>Thomas Presents Three Proposals</p>
<p>[Washington] The Senate inflation faction has now begun a new movement advocating the use of silver coins. The Supreme Court's ruling on the gold clause case has, in effect, upheld Congress's right to regulate the national currency. Senator Thomas immediately seized this opportunity and today proposed an amendment to the public works bill, with two objectives: (1) to issue new silver coins to reduce the value of the US dollar; (2) to raise the price of silver to the statutory price of $1.29 per ounce, after which silver coins can be minted without restriction. To achieve this goal, the inflation faction proposes three main methods: A. Issue silver certificates based on $1.29, backed by the Treasury's silver reserves; B. Rapidly implement the Treasury's silver repurchase program; C. International debts should be allowed to be settled in silver. Senator Thomas claims that the issuance of new coins will not exceed $100 million, but it can depress the US dollar to its 1926 value and raise the price of silver, after which the United States can submit an international agreement on a bimetallic system. Whether this amendment will pass is uncertain, but some believe that the gold clause ruling has indeed opened the door for the inflation faction to actively campaign. However, some also express the opinion that the Supreme Court's ruling should curb the trend of inflation, because if the value of the US dollar is repeatedly reduced, holders of gold bonds can sue the government to demand compensation for their losses. The reason why the court denied bondholders the right to claim compensation is that the bondholders have not suffered any damage. Therefore, if there is real damage, the right to claim compensation should certainly not be denied. The New York financial community is quite pleased that the state of uncertainty has now disappeared, and expects that activity in the capital market will soon recover. Although it is not yet known when the International Monetary Conference will be held, one of the major obstacles to international monetary stability has now disappeared. (Reuters, 19th)</p>

The meeting adjourned at 10 p.m. Based on the suggestions of Ambassador Kawashima, the following consensus was reached: (1) For countries that were old markets but have adopted trade restriction policies, such as China, France, the United States, Canada, South Africa, and the Soviet Union, efforts should be made to actively ease import restrictions; (2) For countries that were old markets but have not adopted trade restriction policies, such as "Manchukuo," the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, the Straits Settlements, and new markets in Central and South America, such as Central and South America, Turkey, Greece, and Africa, Japan should grant them preferential trade treatment and seek to increase purchases.

<h3>UK House of Commons Studies Indian Constitutional Amendment Bill</h3>
<p>[London] The House of Commons began studying the India Bill today. The first important issue it dealt with was the appointment of the Viceroy of India. Labour MP Thorne moved a motion to establish a permanent committee composed of former Viceroys of India, with whom the Prime Minister must first consult before appointing a Viceroy under the new constitution. Thorne believed that the Viceroy was the cornerstone of the entire constitutional structure, and the selection of a person for this important position should not be influenced by party politics. Indian Affairs Secretary Hoare stated that the purpose of this motion was to ensure that the selection of the Viceroy was not dominated by partisan politics, and he expressed sympathy, but he could not agree to transferring the responsibility of the Prime Minister and the Cabinet to a committee. The Liberal Party and the Labour Party also opposed this motion, so the motion was eventually withdrawn. Conservative MP Hulbert proposed an amendment stipulating in the constitution that the Viceroy could not be removed from office except by a petition from both houses of Parliament to the King, but this proposal was defeated by 324 votes to 49. The issue of the All-India Federation was then discussed, and Hulbert proposed the establishment of a Grand Indian Advisory Council, composed of representatives from the Indian princely states and British India.

<h3>Number of Japanese Opium Addicts in Manchuria on the Rise</h3>
<p>The Tokyo Hochi Shimbun reported on the 15th that the history of Japanese in Manchuria is more than 30 years old. Since the September 18th Incident, the number of people moving in has been increasing day by day. Unexpectedly, the number of people who smoke opium and use morphine has also been increasing. Among them, young people in their prime are the most numerous. The reason for this is that Japanese people in border areas lack any kind of comfort, so once they set foot in the red-light district, they are all moved by curiosity and swallow opium. After that, they gradually become addicted and it is difficult to break the habit. In the future, as negotiations with Manchuria become more complex, the number of Japanese opium addicts will inevitably increase.</p>
<h3>Hauptmann Granted Appeal</h3>
<p>Trenton Hauptmann, who was sentenced to death in the Lindbergh kidnapping case, was very pleased today to learn that he had applied to the New Jersey Supreme Court of Appeals for review.

The judge today granted the defendant's request that all expenses for the transcripts of the case be borne by the State of New Jersey, as the defendant claims to be poor and requests relief.

<h3>Luan County Local Troops Suddenly Clash</h3>
<p>Both Sides Suffer Casualties</p>
<p>Neighboring Counties Under Martial Law</p>
<p>Beiping News Luan County War Zone Security First Brigade, led by Liu Zuozhou, recently reorganized the county's militia, sending many trainers to various districts, resulting in dissatisfaction from the militia. Gao Congshan, the head of the Third District Militia, and Yin Laosan, among others, secretly gathered 4,000 militiamen and went to Duoyutun and Machengle Camp to disarm the militia trainers sent by Liu, and tied up the school principals and civil servants appointed by Liu, and transported them in 20 carts to outside the north gate of Bencheng, and planned to confiscate the firearms of the Bencheng militia. At this time, Liu had received the report and urgently sent more than 1,000 cavalrymen to go, resulting in a conflict with the militia in Bencheng. The battle lasted for about three hours, and the cavalrymen were defeated and retreated. Liu continued to send more than 2,000 men to go, and the militia retreated. It is estimated that two cavalrymen were killed, one militiaman was killed, and more than 100 were injured. Luan County Magistrate Chen Cengshi, after the incident, telegraphed to the provincial government and the special commissioner's office to consult on mediation. The special commissioner's office also sent personnel to go, joining local gentry to run around, but both sides wanted to try their strength, resulting in no clue. Tao Shangming had decided to return to Tangshan with Zhao Lei on the 19th to mediate, but the local troops had contact again at 8:00 PM on the 18th, and it did not stop until the morning of the 19th. Both sides of the local troops had casualties, and the fighting in the Bencheng area was fierce, and the situation was extremely bad. Tangshan, Fengrun, Qian'an, and Zunhua, neighboring counties, have all been placed under martial law since the 18th. The local militias of these counties have also been transferred to the border area to strengthen prevention.</p>
<p>Zhao Lei, the commander of the First Battalion of the Luan-Yu District Security Team, was summoned by the War Zone Clearing Committee yesterday to come to Beiping to meet with the standing committee members Zhu Shiqin and Yin Rugeng to discuss the troop rotation matters of the War Zone Security Team.

Zhao himself, due to the conflict between the local troops in Luan County, is scheduled to leave Beiping and return to Tangshan on the morning of the 20th (19th).</p>
<h3>Hebei Provincial Government Decides to Move to Baoding</h3>
<p>The Provincial Government Dispatches Personnel to Survey Housing</p>
<p>The Department of Civil Affairs to be Reorganized on March 1st</p>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: Regarding the issue of the Hebei Provincial Government moving to Baoding, Chairman Yu (Xuezhong) dispatched Jiang Chunyan, the Deputy Adjutant of the 51st Army, ten days ago to Baoding to investigate available housing. Jiang returned during the Spring Festival and reported that although the old Governor's Office buildings were dilapidated, they could still be used after repairs. However, they were not as spacious as the Tianjin Provincial Government buildings, and it would not be possible to combine the military headquarters into one office. It would be necessary to consult with the Baoding Headquarters and move to another location, letting the old Imperial Palace buildings be used for the military headquarters, which would be sufficient. After receiving the report, the province will send workers this month to repair the buildings before moving. Although the regulations for joint office work have long been drafted, they have not been implemented immediately because the move to Baoding is imminent. Instead of making a troublesome merger now, it is better to do it all at once in the future. Before the move to Baoding is implemented, the Department of Civil Affairs, in order to reduce expenses and increase administrative efficiency, has decided to reorganize on March 1st. The subordinate Provincial General Affairs Office, the Autonomous Planning Office, the Rural Pacification Office, and the Relief Association will all be abolished and incorporated into the Department. The tasks to be handled by each committee will be re-divided, and a new section will be added, making a total of five sections along with the original four, each responsible for its own duties. Secretaries, inspectors, and technical staff will be placed directly under the control of the Director. In the past, the Department of Civil Affairs' annual budget was 186,384 yuan, with a monthly expenditure of 15,532 yuan. Later, due to financial difficulties, the budget was repeatedly cut, and in the 22nd year of the Republic, the actual monthly expenditure was only 6,200 yuan. The monthly expenditure for the Department's inspectors was initially 2,160 yuan, but was recently reduced to 1,824 yuan. The Department's workload has increased year by year. Initially, the annual number of issued documents was over 80,000, but last year it increased to over 170,000. The personnel of the Police Department, the Rural Pacification Office, and the Autonomous Planning Office are all concurrently serving from within the Department, and their duties are very heavy. This time, the Department has decided to reorganize, and the staff's treatment will also be slightly improved, and the progress of work can be accelerated compared to before. The duties of each of the five sections have been approved by the provincial government's regular meeting. The first section is responsible for the appointment, dismissal, promotion, transfer, assessment, and reward of county magistrates, and the organization and rectification of county governments. The second section is responsible for planning autonomy, land surveying, household registration statistics, and elections. The third section is responsible for water and land public safety, guarding rural areas, suppressing bandits, and county defense and foreign affairs. The fourth section is responsible for grain storage and disaster relief, as well as other social relief, opium prohibition, drug prohibition, sanitation, epidemic prevention, social customs, religion, and preservation of antiquities. The fifth section is responsible for guarding seals, storing, receiving, dispatching, copying, and proofreading documents, and accounting and general affairs. In addition, there are positions such as secretary's office, technical officer, technician, inspector, and secretary, but their authority has not been increased, only reorganized compared to before.

<h3>Central Government Sends Engineering Experts to Survey the Confucius Temple in Qufu</h3>
<p>Shandong Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Join the Survey</p>
<p>Personnel Investigating Descendants of the Four Sages Depart in the Same Car</p>
<p>Jinan Dispatch: Tang Wencong and Zhong Lingji, section chiefs dispatched by the Ministries of Interior and Education, and Liang Encheng (eldest son of Liang Qichao), a specially appointed ancient architectural engineering expert from the central government, recently contacted Zhang Honglie, Director of the Construction Department, and He Siyuan, Director of the Education Department, regarding the matter of repairing the Confucius Temple. The Construction Department dispatched technicians Wang Jizhong and Yang Judou (who had estimated the Confucius Temple project twice), and Xiaoqing River engineer Yu Gaomin, who were scheduled to depart from Jinan at 9:00 am on the 19th to accompany Liang et al. to Qufu to jointly survey the Confucius Temple. Kong Lingcan, the secretary of the Education Department, went to Qufu on the night of the 18th to prepare to welcome them and lead the survey on behalf of the Kong clan. It is said that after the survey is completed, Liang, Tang, and Zhong will return to Beijing or Jinan, because this matter is of great importance and cannot be designed and estimated without several surveys. On the morning of the 18th, the provincial government hosted a banquet for Liang and his party. During the banquet, Liang talked about the steps of the project, believing that the first survey would only be a general one, looking at the extent of the damage. The second survey would be more detailed, and high scaffolding must be erected to see the details from a high place. The third step is to design. The steps of the project should first repair the framework, and then decorate the exterior, with equal emphasis on firmness and not losing the original appearance. It was previously estimated that 1 million yuan was needed. Although he has not yet personally surveyed, he roughly said that it may not cost 1 million yuan. The future project will probably have to be done by themselves. It is expected that no one will dare to contract for the work, because when Zhang Zongchang was in Shandong, he repaired the Xiangdian once, contracted for 60,000 yuan, and ended up spending 80,000 yuan, and the contractor even lost 7,000 yuan. Therefore, no one may dare to contract for the repair of the Confucius Temple this time. It is also said that the central government's method of apportioning funds to the provinces for the repair of the Confucius Temple is that, except for remote and poor provinces, the inland provinces will be apportioned a maximum of 260,000 yuan and a minimum of 60,000 yuan. After the banquet, Liang and his party went to the Provincial Library to visit and toured Daming Lake. They went to Qufu on the morning of the 19th. In addition to organizing the Confucius Temple, the central government is also investigating the descendants of the Four Sages, Yan, Zeng, Si, and Meng, and will grant each of them the title of Sacrificial Officer to honor the sacrifices, and will also provide assistance to the descendants of the Sages to study. The two departments of education and civil affairs of this province were ordered to investigate and report the descendants of the Sages. Now, the Education Department has sent Inspector Xu Meisheng, and the Civil Affairs Department has sent Inspector Li Weixia, who are scheduled to go south in the same car with the experts surveying the Confucius Temple on the morning of the 19th. According to Kong Lingcan, the uncle of Kong Decheng, each of the descendants of the Sages has a genealogy to check, which should not be very difficult. As far as he knows, only the Zeng clan (in Jiaxiang County) is slightly sparse in population. The current Zeng Sacrificial Officer, Zeng Fansan, is still young and is involved in a lawsuit. During the Southern Song Dynasty, a part of the descendants of Zeng migrated south with the Song Dynasty, so there is a branch of the Zeng clan in Zhejiang now. The current president of the Shandong Agricultural College, Zeng Shengzhi, is their descendant. As for the Kong clan, there are a total of 60 branches. They are currently revising the genealogy. When the Song Dynasty moved south, the eldest branch also went south with them, which is the Southern Branch. Now, the clan in Quzhou, Zhejiang, has the largest population. Perhaps the Southern Branch was not allowed to come north, so they gave the responsibility of sacrifice to the second branch, which is the one in Qufu now. In addition, there is a branch in Shanxi, of which Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi is a member. He is a member of the Yan character generation of the Ming Dynasty and emigrated to Shanxi to do business. (18th)</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Reorganizes Administrative Regions</h3>
<p>— Boundaries of Each County Will be Redrawn —</p>
<p>Nanchang Dispatch: Jiangxi Province is surrounded by mountains on all sides, and the administrative regions of each county have always been uneven, which causes many inconveniences in administrative facilities and local management. This is especially true in southern Jiangxi and the remote border areas. For example, Ningdu County is too large in area, and the four townships are beyond reach. Chongyi County is located in the remote northeast border, and Xingguo County is located in the southwest, with each township too far from the county government. Also, the Longgang, Tengtian, Cihua, Zhaoqiao, Fenggang, and Dawen areas, which were established separately during the bandit suppression period, are all adjacent to two provinces or four or five counties, forming a "three-no-care" situation. The provincial government believes that the administrative region is of great importance to administrative efficiency, and especially for handling rural pacification, searching for scattered bandits, organizing Baojia, and building roads, it will not be successful without reorganizing the regions. It has decided to actively proceed in accordance with the Outline for Reorganizing Administrative Regions and the Regulations on Surveying Boundaries of Provinces, Cities, and Counties promulgated by the Ministry of Interior, starting with the newly recovered areas in southern Jiangxi. The provincial government has ordered the personnel sent to Ningdu, Huichang, Anyuan, Xunwu, and Xingguo to work with local officials to investigate and survey the boundaries of each region, draw maps, and report in detail, so that after review, they can be reorganized and redrawn, or new governments can be established, so that they are convenient in terms of natural form, county jurisdiction, and administrative facilities, so as to avoid providing opportunities for bandits to mix in again and to stabilize the local area.

<h3>Jiangnan Defense Army Breaks Bandit Nest in Youshan</h3>
<p>Small Gangs of Zhan and Yang are Gradually Eliminated</p>
<p>Guangzhou Dispatch: After the large gang of Communist bandits in southern Jiangxi fled west into Sichuan, only the remaining bandits of Ye Jianying's gang, six or seven thousand, are scattered between Yudu and Xingguo. A few days ago, they attacked Niuling from Xiaoxi, trying to capture Xinfeng and plunder food. They were severely attacked by the Xinfeng defense army, and the bandit crowd fled to Maling. The Guangdong army has now sent teams to encircle and suppress them, and at the same time, they are searching for bandit traces in Xiaoxi. Yesterday, the First Army also learned from scouts that there was still a gang of Communist bandits hiding in Youshan, on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi. The ridge connects the counties of Dayu, Nanxiong, Xinfeng, and Shixing for hundreds of miles, with deep mountains, dense forests, and narrow paths. It is not easy to go deep into the mountains to search for them without a large army. The bandit gang in the mountain is led by bandits Yang Bensheng and Zhan Biao, each with about eight or nine hundred people. When the Communist bandits tried to capture Xinfeng a few days ago, the two small gangs hid in the mountain, waiting for opportunities to steal and attack. Therefore, the transportation on the border of Guangdong and Jiangxi has often been destroyed by the gang. The defense army believes that this is a hidden danger and sent troops to search and suppress them the day before yesterday. After receiving the order, Regiment Commander Liao led his troops through Lidong, Dengfang, and Zhongzhan to the Xinxiong border area, encountering more than a dozen small gangs of scattered bandits along the way. They finally broke the bandit nest in Youshan, burned down more than a dozen bandit strongholds, and captured three or four hundred local Communists alive. Every time Regiment Commander Liao recovers a place, he divides a company to garrison and prevent the bandits from regrouping. On the one hand, he sends teams to surround the remaining bandits, and now there are only about five or six hundred remaining bandits, with less than two hundred guns, which is not a cause for concern. For the sake of organizing the bandit area, the defense army has recently recruited local people to return to their hometowns, restore farming, and build roads to facilitate transportation, and has also established civilian primary schools to influence poor children and prevent them from being misled by Communist heresies and becoming bandits.

<h3>Jiangsu Department of Finance Reorganizes Procedures for Collecting Land Tax in Various Counties</h3>
<p>Eight Principles for Reorganization and Rectification are Established</p>
<p>Zhenjiang Dispatch: The Jiangsu Department of Finance has repeatedly ordered the improvement of land tax collection procedures in various counties. The county governments have followed and implemented the orders, and there are many who are brave in reform, but there are also those who cling to old habits and are perfunctory. In particular, the preparatory procedures for starting collection in various counties are extremely cumbersome, and they are often carried out in their own way due to old habits, allowing clerks to engage in malpractices and not following the regulations, resulting in chaotic and varied procedures for collecting grain in various counties, making it difficult to investigate and verify. The government finds it difficult to audit, and the work of collecting tax has almost become a specialized secret affair, which cannot be handled without those clerks. Now, in order to unify and reorganize the procedures for collecting the first installment of land tax in the 24th year of the Republic in various counties, the Department of Finance has specially established eight principles for reorganization, and ordered them to be promulgated to various counties on the 19th (except for the seven counties of Zhenjiang, Yixing, Kunshan, Jiading, Liyang, Jiangyin, and Baoshan, which are included in the pilot program for improving the land tax collection system) to follow and implement, so as to completely eliminate the bad habits of slackness from the first installment of land tax in the 24th year of the Republic. The eight principles are as follows:</p>
<p>Principles of Reorganization (1) From the 24th year of the Republic, all counties shall implement the principle of combining busy and transport taxes, and dividing the collection into two installments, four-six. Those counties that have not yet implemented this principle shall calculate and prepare the forms two months before the start of the first installment of the 24th year, and report them to this department for approval. If anyone still follows old habits and requests changes after the fact, it will not be allowed. (2) Two months before the start of the first installment of land tax in the 24th year, each county shall prepare a collection register with the full names, plot numbers, Mu allocation, or silver-rice amounts (the principle is that the Mu allocation and silver-rice amounts are both available, and if there is no Mu allocation, the silver-rice amount should be noted) of all grain households in the county, and the amount of tax to be collected (referring to the total amount of regular and surtax, Mu donation, collection fee, etc., not just the amount of regular tax to be collected converted into silver and rice). It must be filled in according to the regulations in detail, and must not be perfunctory or omitted. Serial tickets shall be prepared based on the collection register. The form of the collection register and serial ticket is attached to each county for reference. (3) When preparing the serial tickets, each county shall pay attention to the following matters: A. The serial ticket should be divided into three copies: stub, license, and notice, all of which should indicate the name of the grain household, the plot number, the Mu allocation, the amount of grain, and the date. B. The serial ticket should be prepared in two installments in principle. If any county has special circumstances, it may apply to prepare them together in two installments, but the license copy of the second installment must be kept blank, and then filled in and stamped after the autumn survey is finalized and the deduction is verified. C. All serial tickets must be filled in with regular script. The grain amount column must be stamped with a lead-type wooden stamp, and must not be written in demon characters or other simplified characters. D. The amount of grain to be paid as stated on the serial ticket shall include all provincial and county surtaxes, donations, collection fees, handling fees, and writing fees (the Mu donations of previous land surveys were added by stamping or collecting receipts separately, but from the first installment of the 24th year, they should be abolished and uniformly calculated into various Mu donations). The total grain amount must be consistent with the cash paid by the owner, otherwise, they are specially allowed to report to the provincial department for investigation and handling according to law. (4) From the 24th year, all procedures for preparing registers and serial tickets shall be completed before the start of each installment. They must not be deliberately delayed, or even submit a blank document after the start of collection. In the future, they must report to the department for approval in advance before collection can begin. (5) Before the start of each installment of land tax, each county must first distribute the serial ticket notice to each owner in advance for inspection, and post the land grade, tax rate, tax amount, and other matters that the owner should pay attention to, and print a brief explanation book and distribute it to the village and town Baojia leaders for dissemination and publicity, so as to encourage the owners to pay in large numbers and eliminate the bad habit of clerks collecting and paying on their behalf. (6) Before the start of the first installment of land tax in each year, each county must list in detail the tax rate per Mu, the total amount of provincial and county regular and surtaxes to be collected, and their percentage ratios, and report them to the Department of Finance for approval. The form is attached later. (7) At least the following kinds of land tax collection books and registers must be prepared in each county: A. For audit purposes, a serial ticket registration book (i.e., daily receipt book, flow book, or circular hall book) and a serial ticket report form shall be prepared. B. For tax collection purposes, a cash daily receipt book, a payment book, and a daily report of tax collected shall be prepared. The forms of the aforementioned books and registers shall be determined and issued by the department for use. If there are special circumstances and other books and registers need to be added, the facts must be reported in detail and the form of the books and registers must be submitted together to the department for approval before they can be printed and prepared for use, so as to achieve uniformity. (8) In the past, land tax in various counties was collected by setting up counters according to old practices. The organization of the grain counters shall be strictly reorganized by the county from the 24th year. Except for the serial number management room, which shall be inspected and managed by personnel sent by the county, the rest shall be based on the principle of establishing three separate parts: calculation, collection, and issuance of serial numbers. It is best if the collection part can be collected by the treasury, otherwise, it should be carefully entrusted by the county to prevent overcharges. The total number of daily receipts and serial numbers issued should be consistent, and the accounting director sent by the department should be responsible for spot checks and audits at any time.

<p>The local drug trafficker Zhang Lao Si was found carrying ten taels of opium from Shanghai to Shihudang by the second squad leader of the third water police team, Hu Tu. He was handed over to the Opium Prohibition Committee for interrogation and then transferred to the county government for legal action. Fei Rongquan, a morphine trafficker in Xinzhuang Chenxing, was also arrested. After clear interrogation, both were undoubtedly guilty. The county government immediately prepared a document and sent two criminals by car to Zhenjiang to the police garrison headquarters for legal punishment, escorted by political police Dong Futang on the afternoon of the 20th.</p>
<h3>Wuxi</h3>
<p>Provincial and County Rivers Start Building Dams</p>
<p>The county's work-relief river dredging plan has been approved by the province after being submitted by the County Construction Bureau, with reference to the work-relief method. The six sections of the Bei Xing Tang River, the Nan Ma Li Port, the Lü River, the Li Niu Jian River, the Chang Guang Creek, and the Xian Tang River in Xizhang will be dredged first, with a predetermined expenditure of 30,000 yuan. Construction will start on March 1st, and work-relief offices will be set up by the Work-Relief River Dredging Committee in the public offices in the river dredging areas. The surveying work has now been completed, and it has been decided that the foundations of the large and small dams of the six major rivers and tributaries will begin on the 35th. The dam construction project will be carried out by each office in charge, with sixty as the standard. The Xichang section of the canal being dredged by the province has also been surveyed by the Construction Bureau, and the dam has begun to be cut off. The head of the Jiangyin side, Ren Jichang, ordered technicians Xu Chuzhen and Xu Chuanlie to go to measure it. As soon as everything is ready, it must be submitted to the province for approval.</p>
<p>Public Security Bureau Breaks Another Drug-Making Organization</p>
<p>In addition to Tu Guiqing, whose case has been solved, the other drug-making organization in Wuxi is that of Wu Zongli, which is very large in scale. However, because the defense is very tight, it has not been cracked yet. Wang (missing character), the inspector of the County Public Security Bureau, recently received a secret report and found clues after investigation. He then sent inspector Ge Xinde to disguise and wait, and tried to buy the evidence. So, at dawn yesterday, he called the local leaders and rushed to Wu's residence near Sanniu to knock on the door and enter, arresting Wu Zongli and the drug-making technician Sun Bingsheng, the dedicated transporter Li Jisheng, and seven others including Lu Guisong, Gu Maosheng, Chen Lin, Tao Gaoyunxiang, and others, along with the drug-making machinery, wooden boards, drug sieves, and powder, as well as the steel spring pliers with the two characters "He Ji" used for sealing, and other pieces of evidence, and sent them all to the Public Security Bureau to await legal action. At the same time, Zhang Jun, a drug dealer selling drugs in Houqi Street, was also found and brought to the bureau.</p>
<p>Yixing Inmates Escape Prison at Midnight</p>
<p>Among the unresolved serious criminals in the Yixing County Government Detention Center, there was Gu Tongsheng, the former grain transport chief of the county, who embezzled more than 200,000 yuan over the years. After the case was discovered, he was arrested and detained in the detention center for three months. However, the day before yesterday at midnight, he suddenly escaped with two other serious criminals. County Magistrate Zhong Jingcheng believed that Dong Shanpei, the warden of the detention center, had been negligent and ordered him and the director of the prison to be shackled and imprisoned, and telegraphed to neighboring counties to pay attention to and assist in the arrest. After receiving the telegram, Wuxi Magistrate Yan ordered his subordinates to strictly investigate the stations and ports.</p>

<p>Spring Famine Already Seen in Counties North of the Yangtze River</p>
<p>In the counties of Tong, Ru, and Hai north of the Yangtze River, the harvest was poor due to the drought last year, and the side businesses of the rural villages also failed in nine out of ten cases. The current situation in the countryside is very difficult, and signs of famine have already been seen. Each county is now rushing to handle grain sales at stable prices and setting up agricultural warehouses to relieve the rural economy. As for the various industries in the city, they are extremely exhausted. The only turning point will be when the two wheat crops come on the market.</p>

<p>Three Thousand Yuan to Redeem Silk Fails</p>
<p>In recent years, there have been cases of undeclared foreign goods passing through the pond in Zhaopu Haikou, a county town, and being transported to various ports in Shanghai and Hangzhou. On the 15th, there were 40 packages of artificial silk transported from Dalian and the Wife Station, coming from Ningbo to Zhaopu. The package was addressed to Lu Caixing, who received and unloaded the goods. Hong Jutai sent it, as reported by a Wang to the police team. The police team sent a team to seize them. The coolies fled in fear when they saw the police team coming. The entire shipment was seized. It is said that this shipment was contracted by a Lu in Hongkou, Shanghai. Upon hearing of the seizure, they immediately sent someone in a special car to Zhaopu to contact the relevant parties, willing to pay 3,000 yuan as a reward. However, Zhou Pengfei, the police captain, opposed bribery and refused their request.</p>

<p>Dear Sir, I have just read a report in your newspaper on the 18th, a dispatch from Jiangyin about a conflict between police and gamblers in Nanzha, in which it was stated that Chiang, the principal of the Nanzha Primary School, was mistakenly detained.

<h3>City Chamber of Commerce and Other Four Groups Meet to Discuss Preventing and Rescuing the City's Economic Decline</h3>
<p>Exchange Important Opinions on the Current Market Situation</p>
<p>Consensus is That Mutual Communication and Stabilizing People's Hearts are the Top Priorities</p>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports: When the silver problem occurred last year, it caused fluctuations in the financial community. At the same time, due to the general economic decline in recent years, there were also some difficulties in various industries in the business community before and after the end of the year, forming a general social unease. This situation has recently been improved after the government authorities made efforts to remedy it, and there is hope for improvement. The City Local Cooperation Association, City Chamber of Commerce, Banking Association, and Money Industry Association and other four major groups held a joint meeting at 4:00 pm on the 18th, at 1138 Jing'an Temple Road, to discuss ways to prosper and prevent the city's economic decline. The attendees included City Chamber of Commerce Chairman Yu Zuoting, Money Industry Association Chairman Qin Runqing, Banking Association Secretary-General Lin Kanghou, Local Cooperation Association Chairman Du Yuesheng, China Bank Zhang Gongquan, Bei Songsheng, Zhejiang Industrial Bank Li Fuxun, Shanghai Bank Chen Guangfu, and other ten more people. Detailed content of the discussion proposal, for reasons, temporarily not published. However, according to the Shen Shi News Agency reporter inquired to the relevant parties that the collective consultation topic is about (1) How to stabilize the local market and improve the general business environment, (2) In this downturn period, the financial sector and the business sector should How to seek contact to overcome the difficulties and seek the revival of the market. There are also many other financial and commercial cases. The discussion lasted two hours. The concrete results of the discussion heard that all parties are willing to work together to stabilize the current market, so as to stabilize people's hearts. The financial sector is determined to do its best to maintain mutual assistance and contact within the possible scope of the business sector. According to a certain business leader who participated in the meeting, the leader of the Shen Shi News Agency reporter said that this time, the leaders of the Local Coordination Association, City Chamber of Commerce, Banking Association, and Money Industry Association gathered to exchange opinions on the current situation of the financial sector and the business sector, so that there can be communication. After the meeting, there was no formal concrete decision. It is generally believed that the current anxiety caused by the silver problem and the economic downturn has been improved after the government has made efforts to remedy it. There should be gradual improvement in the future. At the same time, in the face of the economic downturn, the common master is to stabilize people's hearts as the top priority, so as to reach the point of revitalizing the market and prospering under the guidance of the government authorities.</p>
<h3>Money Industry Inner Garden Meeting</h3>
<p>Decided to Improve and Develop Business</p>
<p>New Voice News Agency reports that the Money Industry Inner Garden Meeting decided to improve its business, hold quarterly meetings every year to discuss, Qin Runqing talked about that this year's business policy should be done according to ability, the details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Inner Garden Meeting Improves Business</p>
<p>The Money Industry Association held a public sacrifice to the former directors in the inner garden in the South City on the 18th of this month. Chairman Qin Runqing reported on the situation of the money industry last year, the inner garden budget, and the final accounts. They also discussed the business policy for this year and decided to improve and develop the business, hold quarterly meetings every year, and convene meetings of managers of various money houses every quarter to discuss improvements. The first quarter of this year has been scheduled for tomorrow, address Money Industry Association, and the notice has been issued.</p>
<p>Business Policy Acting According to Ability</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Mr. Qin Runqing, Chairman of the Money Industry Association, yesterday. According to him, after the total conclusion of the relief in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, all the money houses have been listed. As for this year's business policy, they should all act according to their ability. Because they were affected by the overall economic downturn last year, all industries declined, and the money industry suffered a great deal. Therefore, this year's business must be determined by the strength of each bank. For example, after a patient has been seriously ill, their diet must depend on whether they can digest it. At first, they eat thin porridge and gradually recover. Various external rumors are not credible. The remittance folds sent by various banks have already begun, and those who have not sent them are not that the money houses are unwilling to send them, but their own credit is the problem.</p>
<h3>Satisfaction Expressed by Various Industries After Reward for Silver Imports</h3>
<p>Losses from Ping Shi Silver Purchases to be Paid from Funds</p>
<p>According to interviews conducted yesterday by reporters from the Xin Sheng News Agency with leaders of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce and the Silver and Money Trade Association, after the Ministry of Finance increased the silver export tax and equalization tax to prevent silver exports and stabilize finance, silver exports have decreased. The current implementation of rewarding foreign silver imports is a very appropriate measure that is closely related to the development of industry and commerce and the revival of rural areas. In the future, foreign merchants will inevitably transport silver for import and invest in the Chinese market, and Shanghai will not have to worry about a shortage of silver.</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Stabilization Committee purchased Hong Kong silver and transported it to Shanghai to stabilize the market. Now, it has purchased another three million yuan of silver from the London market. However, the losses incurred from the silver purchase will be paid from the fund, that is, the previously collected equalization tax. As for the equalization tax announced daily by the committee, it will not be cancelled. Yesterday morning, the tax rate announced was 5.75 per hundred yuan. In addition, the Central Bank announced the selling price of telegraphic transfers, equivalent to one shilling five pence 875 for London yesterday, thirty-six US dollars 4375 for New York, five hundred forty-nine francs for Paris, and ninety marks for Berlin.</p>
<h3>Gu Xin-yi Issues Important Statement on Foreign Rice</h3>
<p>The Quantity of Foreign Rice Imports Should Be Determined by Needs</p>
<p>Supply and Demand Being Equivalent, Ordering Should Be Restricted Hereafter</p>
<p>Foreign Trade in Coarse Grains Has Turned into a Surplus</p>
<p>According to the Da Gong News Agency, Gu Xin-yi, chairman of the Municipal Coarse Grains Trade Association, gave an important statement yesterday to the Da Gong News Agency reporter who visited him regarding the process of ordering foreign rice, which is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Comparison of Foreign Rice Imports Over the Years</p>
<p>China is an agricultural country, and grain can originally be self-sufficient. However, due to backward domestic production, frequent disasters, and the surplus of foreign agricultural products, which are actively dumped, the import of foreign rice has formed a major social problem today. Tracing back to 1929, the Jiang-Zhe region suffered a drought, and there was panic over food. It was necessary to rely on a huge amount of foreign rice. Therefore, in 1930, imports reached more than 8 million bags, which was truly an unprecedented record. However, it was also fortunate to have this huge supply of foreign rice that the rice price could be maintained at a maximum of 23 or 24 yuan per picul. In 1931, there were floods in the Yangtze River basin, but according to national harvest statistics, the shortage of rice was still limited. Therefore, in 1932, there were not many foreign rice imports. More than 500,000 bags imported by a certain foreign firm at that time were not needed in reality, and more than 300,000 bags were left in stock. From 1932, there were consecutive years of good harvests, and domestic rice was abundant, and prices plummeted. In 1933, in Shanghai alone, not only was not a single grain of foreign rice imported, but even the rice left in stock by a certain foreign firm was still ignored. It was not until last year, when the drought developed, that it was sold off at a low price. Thus, it can be seen that the need for foreign rice and the quantity of its import are all determined by the lack or abundance of domestic grain.</p>
<p>Last Year's Orders Matched Supply and Demand</p>
<p>Last year, there was a severe drought, and the degree of famine and panic over food throughout the country was almost the same as in 1930. Therefore, there was an urgent need for foreign rice, and the import of foreign rice was continuous. In order to ensure the appropriateness of supply and demand, the association should conduct a thorough investigation. According to recent investigation reports from various foreign firms, as of January 18 this year, the total number of orders reached more than 6.3 million bags. In addition to the previous sales of more than 1.8 million bags, the current number of bags being shipped but not yet arrived and those that have been ordered but not yet shipped totals about 4 million bags (of which about 500,000 bags will arrive in Shanghai around February 15). Combined with the recent sales of about 500,000 bags, the total is about 4.5 million bags. This is the general situation obtained by the association's investigation before January 18, which is also consistent with the total number of foreign rice registrations by the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, and should not be far from the truth. Furthermore, according to the sales estimates of foreign rice, the average daily sales of various provinces is 20,000 bags, and the local sales in Shanghai is 5,000 bags, totaling 6 months until mid-August of the lunar calendar, and the total sales volume is exactly 4.5 million bags, which is consistent with the total number of orders obtained in the previous investigation, and the supply and demand are exactly equivalent. Therefore, the association believes that it is necessary to stop ordering from now on, and has tried to repeatedly warn the industry, and is even preparing to submit it to the authorities for a fundamental ban.</p>
<p>Foreign Trade in Coarse Grains Has Turned into a Surplus</p>
<p>As for the relationship between foreign rice imports and the money supply, of the one million bags of foreign rice currently stored in Shanghai, about half have not yet paid for the documents, plus the 3.5 million bags that have not yet been shipped, totaling 4 million bags. The average market price per bag is 11 yuan and 56 cents. Excluding the import tax of 3 yuan and 56 cents, which is government revenue, each bag is worth about 8 yuan, so the total value is 32 million yuan. The number of excess imports of foreign goods is increasing day by day, which is already alarming, and adding the ordering of foreign rice and the outflow of such a large amount of money, it is difficult to avoid the serious attention of the social community. However, in reality, the coarse grains industry has been engaged in foreign trade. In 1934, Shanghai and Hankou exported sesame seeds worth about 15 million yuan, Qingdao exported peanut kernels and peanut oil worth about 13 million yuan, and other oil cakes and beans exported worth about 8 million yuan, totaling about 36 million yuan. If only the current imports of the coarse grains industry are calculated, it has already turned into a surplus. If domestic agricultural products have a bumper harvest and foreign rice is no longer needed and not imported, then the surplus of coarse grains will be even more considerable.</p>
<p>Terminating Orders Poses No Threat of Surplus</p>
<p>Moreover, when rice prices plummeted in 1933, the association was the first to appeal to the government to increase the import tax on foreign rice in order to enrich the national treasury and to achieve the practical effect of rescuing rural areas. Today, the situation has changed, and domestic rice is lacking. The industry is entrusted by mainland customers to order foreign rice to provide assistance, which is something that has to be done. Without this assistance, the current rise in rice prices would have already surpassed the rice prices of 1930, and the social situation would not be as peaceful as it is today. Moreover, rescuing the people's food supply cannot be compared with the import of other foreign luxury goods. In summary, according to the above, the current situation of foreign rice purchasing and sales is such that supply and demand are exactly equivalent. Terminating orders from now on poses no threat of surplus. If orders continue to be placed without limit, it will inevitably lead to an oversupply. Then, the precedent of a certain foreign firm's stock of foreign rice being ignored is a lesson that is not far away. It is hoped that grain merchants will be vigilant together.</p>
<h3>Ambassador Yan and Others Depart by Ship This Afternoon</h3>
<p>Yesterday, They Visited Various Parties to Bid Farewell</p>
<p>Dr. Yan Huiqing, Ambassador to the Soviet Union, along with Mei Lanfang, who was invited to Russia to perform, and Zhou Jianyun and Hu Die, who attended the International Film Exhibition, were originally scheduled to depart on the special steamer "Northern" yesterday afternoon. However, due to unfinished trivial matters in Shanghai, the departure was rescheduled for this afternoon. The ship was originally docked at Pudong. Now, for convenience, it is docked at the China Merchants Bureau North Station and is scheduled to depart at 2:00 p.m. today. Yan and others are scheduled to board the ship around 12:00 noon. At that time, there will be a warm send-off at the pier. Since arriving in Shanghai, Yan has been entertained by various parties for several days. Since he must leave today, he specially drove from his residence at the International Hotel early yesterday morning to visit Mayor Wu Tiecheng, prominent figure Du Yuesheng, Soviet Deputy Minister to China Spier Wevnack, Qian Xinzhi, and other relatives and friends in Shanghai to bid farewell.</p>
<h3>Tourist Group to the Philippines Departed from Shanghai Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Returning to Shanghai on the 4th of Next Month</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Wang Xiaolai, deputy leader of the Chinese tourist group to the Philippines, led 27 male and female members, including Pan Gongzhan and Zhu Shaoping, who departed on the President Jackson of the Dollar Steamship Company on the evening of the 19th. More than 100 people from the Municipal Education Bureau, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and representatives of various trade associations and groups came to see them off. The ship has already departed from the Dollar Steamship Company pier at Bailianjing, Pudong, at 3:00 a.m. yesterday. After arriving in Hong Kong on the morning of the 22nd, they plan to go ashore for a day of sightseeing and attend a banquet hosted by the Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce. On the 25th, they will arrive in the Philippines, visit the Carnival Fair for a week, and inspect the commercial situation. After thanking all circles in the Philippines for their farewell banquet, they are scheduled to return to Shanghai from the Philippines on the Changxing Company's Asia Queen on the 4th of next month. The Central News Agency reporter obtained a letter from Wu Tiecheng to the people of the Philippine Islands (translated from the original English manuscript) and Wang Zhengting's article "The Mission of the Tourist Group," which are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Wu Tiecheng's Letter</p>
<p>In recent years, the economic panic has affected the whole world, and the countries along the Pacific coast have also been affected. If we do not adopt the path of "peace and amity," we will not be able to solve the economic crisis and seek prosperity for each other. The political leaders of the Philippine Islands have always been known to the world for their virtue and patriotism. I firmly believe that they will be able to maintain friendly relations with all countries along this peaceful path. Moreover, the Philippine Islands are a land endowed by nature, and they should be able to use their unique endowment to make great contributions to the welfare of mankind. Our country is a close neighbor, and we wish that the "Pearl of the Pacific" will soon realize its mission, and we hope that the cultural and economic relations between the two peoples will become more developed. I personally express my sympathy for any friendly movement between the two peoples and will do my best to support it in order to enhance the friendly relations between China and the Philippines. For hundreds of years, the Chinese people who have traveled far across the oceans to trade in the Philippine Islands have mostly been successful, but they have never interfered in the internal affairs of the Philippine Islands. Based on this historical fact, I am more confident that the two peoples of China and the Philippines will be able to get along with each other and become more and more friendly.</p>
<p>Wang Zhengting's Article</p>
<p>The Chen Bao has a special issue on the departure of the tourist group to the Philippines and asked me to write an article to briefly explain the meaning of the mission of the tourist group. The diplomatic relations between China and the Philippines have always been known for their cordiality, and the relationship between the two countries has a long history, which is deep and close, and needs no further explanation. I have studied the Chinese who have left their motherland, sailed far away, and worked hard to achieve today's success. Their past achievements have been admired by foreigners. However, since foreigners have taken control of the ruling power in various places, they have always harbored discrimination against our Chinese because of racial and national concepts, which is regrettable. In particular, the leaders of the Philippine Islands have always held good feelings towards our Chinese. Therefore, the Chinese in the Philippines who are rich in ideas and capable of implementing their plans and fully developing their careers, so that the Chinese in the Philippines have a thriving trend, which is gratifying. I have studied that the customs and habits of the Philippine Islands have gradually become Europeanized during the 300 years of Spanish rule. After the Americans came, the Filipinos became more aware of the need to work hard to enlighten their knowledge, exercise their bodies, develop industry and commerce, and improve their political status. Recently, with less than one-third of the national land being cultivated, they are also striving to advance, studying agriculture and forestry, and opening up sports fields in many gaps for competition and competition, so sports are very developed. The Philippines has won the top prize in the past Far Eastern Games. The Filipinos are also hospitable, and the carnivals and Christmas festivals that are popular in Europe and the United States are held with enthusiasm every year. Recently, in politics, they have been able to strive for independence. They are truly worthy of a new world in the old world. Whether in spirit or in material, they will surely shine in the future among the various ethnic groups in Southeast Asia, which is worthy of our reference. In addition to visiting the scenery, the tourist group is willing to conduct a detailed study and thorough understanding of the entire situation in the Philippines in order to provide guidance for the development of various undertakings in our country. At the same time, they will also promote Chinese culture to their country as much as possible in order to promote a deep understanding and understanding of the motherland among the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia. This is the mission of the tourist group.</p>
<h3>The Aviation Association Entrusts Banks, Shops, Etc. to Collect Aviation Donations</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, since the second fundraising campaign began, the office of the chief captain of the China Aviation Association has been actively raising donations to gather the strength of the people to assist the government in enriching national defense. The work is very tense. The general manager leads the staff day and night. In order to facilitate the donation of aviation patriotism donations by all sectors of the city, the association has specially entrusted banks, money shops, companies, shops, restaurants, etc. throughout the city to collect donations and has formulated seven measures for collection, which are as follows: 1. The office of the chief captain of the Shanghai fundraising team of the China Aviation Association has specially entrusted banks, money shops, companies, shops, restaurants, etc. throughout the city to collect aviation patriotism donations in order to facilitate the donation of aviation patriotism donations by all sectors of the city. 2. Banks, money shops, companies, shops, restaurants, etc. should hang advertisements and publicity materials for raising aviation patriotism donations on the facade to promote attention from all sectors of the city. 3. Banks, money shops, companies, shops, restaurants, etc. should collect aviation patriotism donations for a period of six months, which may be extended if necessary. 4. Banks, money shops, companies, shops, restaurants, etc. should collect aviation patriotism donations in any amount. After receiving the donations, the first copy of the donation receipt issued by the office should be given to the donor, and the second copy of the receipt should be submitted to the office. At the end of the donation, the third copy of the stub and unused receipts should be sent to the office for verification. 5. Banks, money shops, companies, shops, restaurants, etc. should notify the office of the amount of aviation patriotism donations collected at any time in order to be disclosed in the newspaper. 6. Banks, money shops, companies, shops, restaurants, etc. should make a settlement of the aviation patriotism donations collected every fifteen days and remit the donations collected to the office. 7. If the donation receipts of banks, money shops, companies, shops, restaurants, etc. are not enough, they should be collected from the office on the third floor of the YMCA at Baxianqiao. In addition, the office has specially requested the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Shanghai Bank, and the Bank of Shanghai to collect membership fees and aviation patriotism donations for the convenience of all fundraising teams in paying membership fees and aviation patriotism donations.</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Meinan, the captain of the 202nd fundraising team, wrote to the general team office yesterday, stating that the various fundraising documents previously issued were not enough and requested that additional fundraising overviews, donation receipts, badges, etc. be issued. It is heard that the office has already sent them, which shows the general efforts of the captains in fundraising.</p>
<p>The general team office sent a letter to the captains of the fundraising teams yesterday, requesting that fundraising be started immediately. If there is insufficient time, energy, or strength, the captains can consider the situation and add deputy captains and team members to take on the work in order to achieve practical results. If the various fundraising documents previously sent are not enough, please notify the office at any time by letter or telegram, and they will be sent immediately. Captains are also requested to report any opinions or contributions to the fundraising campaign at any time in order to communicate information and jointly plan the progress.</p>
<h3>Real Estate Slump</h3>
<p>A Glimpse of a Special Phenomenon</p>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, the real estate business has recently experienced a sharp decline. Before the general settlement on the 4th of this month, it was widely rumored in the community that eight immortals had crossed the sea, that is, eight people who owned a large number of real estate properties successively left Shanghai to avoid temporary refuge in order to avoid being forced into an accident. Although the difficult time of the general settlement has passed, the real estate business is still extremely sluggish. Houses and land that could not be bought or dug up before are now often depreciated, and no one cares about them. Recently, the real estate in Linqing Road, Linqing Lane, and Yuezhou Road, Lizhong Lane, was auctioned off by the court at a marked price due to mortgage disputes, and no one bid for it after the deadline. It is now heard that the court has reduced the price by 10% as the lowest price for auction, which is also a special phenomenon of the real estate industry slump.</p>
<h3>Yu Youren Going to Beijing</h3>
<p>Yu Youren took the night express train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<h3>The Agricultural Conference of the Bank of China Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>Continued Discussion of Key Points Today and Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in order to revive the rural economy, the Bank of China launched agricultural loans two years ago. Branches in Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Shaanxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu provinces and cities separately dispatched personnel to handle the loans. In the past two years, due to the good social order in the above-mentioned provinces, the business has been able to develop steadily. By the end of last year, the highest record for loans had reached 2 million yuan. Recently, in order to determine rural investment and study the revival of the rural economy, an agricultural conference was specially held, starting yesterday, at the bank's general management office on Sanma Road. More than 20 agricultural personnel from branches in various provinces and cities attended the conference. Yesterday, they reported on the rural loan situation in their respective locations. Today and tomorrow, they will present various opinions or proposals for discussion and research. The conference is expected to last about four days. All records and written reports will be published in the bank's annual report at the end of March and the beginning of April. In order to understand the bank's recent agricultural loan situation, the Central News Agency reporter specially visited the responsible persons of the bank's secretariat and business department yesterday. According to them, the past two years have been experimental in nature, so only 2 million yuan was loaned. There are many investments in agriculture by the banking industry in the northwest provinces, but due to the vast area, there is still room for development. The bank's loans are mostly invested in product warehouses and credit loans. If there are no products, there is no need to loan. However, if you want to develop credit loans, it is very easy, but for the sake of prudence, it has not been expanded. The best results have been achieved in Shaanxi. Since Shao Lizi took office in Shaanxi, he has paid close attention to the suffering of the people, especially the development of water conservancy, which is more closely related to the welfare of farmers, so the agricultural loan results are the best. Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu also pays attention to the livelihood of farmers, so the results are also good. This type of loan is difficult to achieve without government assistance. The future progress will still be based on the nature of the experiment, and then efforts will be made to develop it in order to revive the rural economy of our country.</p>

<h3>Mr. Struthers, British Cooperative Expert, Discusses Goals of Cooperative Movement</h3>
<p>Continuation of Speech at Shanghai Bank Agricultural Cooperation Meeting</p>
<p>According to statistics from the International Statistical Bureau in Geneva, there are currently 500,000 cooperatives worldwide. Since the cooperative movement shifted from urban to rural areas, there have been slight changes. Initially, the founding fathers of cooperation in Britain and France hoped to solve all the world's problems through the cooperative movement. However, after a century of experience, this kind of all-encompassing ideal can be considered a failure. The current trend is for each cooperative to specialize in one type of business, with only one cooperative of the same nature in a locality, but multiple cooperatives with different natures. However, there are many cooperative instructors in China who advocate running several types of businesses, which is a mistake. The experience from around the world proves that cooperatives that engage in many businesses often fail. Currently, there are still some cooperatives in China lacking accurate statistics, approximately over 10,000. According to Mr. Struthers' observation, many of them are difficult to call genuine cooperatives, and it is feared that there will not be much improvement in the future. Given the backwardness of the Chinese people's education and knowledge, it is of course impossible to expect them to manage cooperatives themselves, but it is also impossible to let them rely on others forever. Chinese cooperative instructors should explain the meaning of cooperation to farmers before organizing them and train them. For those already organized, their content should be inspected frequently. There are two things to pay attention to when organizing: (1) Members should be able to understand the purpose and meaning of cooperation; (2) After organization, regardless of the scope, it should be treated as a business. Special instructions should be given to cooperative members in China who already have some knowledge. It is easier for instructors to guide cooperatives with simple businesses; it is much more difficult for others. Currently, credit cooperatives are the most numerous in China, with about 100 marketing cooperatives and 50 utility and supply cooperatives. These numbers may not be entirely accurate. Within these 10,000 cooperatives, there are credit cooperatives that also engage in marketing, as well as other cooperatives that engage in various combinations. It is best for a cooperative to operate one type of business. Training for instructors should focus on two things: one is the training of members, and the other is strict attention to business methods to make them rational. Because the cooperative movement is extremely important to China's development, the government should also pay special attention and assistance. Mr. Struthers studies marketing, while I will talk to you about credit cooperation. There are three purposes for establishing credit cooperatives: (1) to enable members to escape the oppression of debt; (2) to prevent those without debt from being oppressed by debt in the future; (3) to train members to know how to save and become citizens with good virtues. The debts of Chinese farmers are currently not as significant as those in India and Egypt. I fear that in twenty or thirty years, they will increase day by day. You may not believe it, but I would like to say a word: in twenty years, politics will gradually become clear and social order will gradually become stable. This is something that all Chinese people hope for. However, the clearer the politics, the more the people's debts will increase. Let me give some reasons for debt: (1) Borrowers are willing to borrow, and lenders are willing to lend. If lenders are unwilling to lend, then borrowers will have no way to incur debt; (2) There is a need to borrow, and there is a willingness to borrow, and at the same time, there is also debt. If someone is diligent and does not borrow, then they will not incur debt. If someone does not want to borrow money, they will not end up in debt. There are also two reasons for lending money to people: (1) having the ability to lend money; (2) needing to lend money. We can say that usury and exorbitant taxes are phenomena of poverty. We study under what circumstances those with money are willing to lend money, that is, when politics is clear, transportation is convenient, and laws are effective, lenders can easily sue debtors and confiscate and manage their land and property without suffering losses. Therefore, when there is legal protection, those with money are willing to lend money. At this time, Chinese politics is inferior to India's, so the oppression of farmers' debt is not very heavy. This does not mean that good politics is useless, but only that while politics is clear, it is also necessary to prevent the increase of people's debt. A hundred years ago, the people of India, except for a few cities, had little debt. Because in the past few decades, political reforms, order stabilization, and legal protection have been in place, the government has not paid attention to prevention, so the people's debt has deepened day by day. Indian courts enforce the law very quickly, and the government has detailed records of people's land registration in the land bureau. Lenders are willing to lend because they have protection, and people are willing to borrow because they lack education. When they encounter weddings and funerals, they borrow money from people, resulting in waste, so debt deepens day by day. In the past thirty years, with the cooperative movement, economic use, and proper allocation, there is now a need to borrow money in China. Because of frequent floods and droughts, as well as the increase in exorbitant taxes, people have an urgent need to borrow money. Also, although some farmers are poor, due to the import of foreign goods, the increase in machinery, and the high standard of living, people now have a demand and need for borrowing money, but lenders are unwilling to lend much, so the people's debt is not very heavy. Once politics is on track and those with money are willing to lend money, then the people's debt will inevitably become heavier day by day. Therefore, before the people's debt becomes heavy, there is one thing to pay attention to: (1) Find a way to have a good financial organization to facilitate circulation, while not causing the oppression of debt, that is, the need for the emergence of a credit cooperative system; (2) Improve production and marketing technology, that is, the need for the emergence of a marketing cooperative system; (3) Train people to know how to be frugal and how to allocate money for appropriate purposes, so as not to waste it. This can be guided by credit cooperatives and social improvement cooperatives. I hope that you will not only pay attention to the surface, but also pay attention to the content, and should find out the root cause and prescribe the right medicine. The root cause should also be explained in detail to farmers, and they should not only be given medicine to take. The above meaning may be difficult for ordinary farmers to understand, but you can agree that using charitable undertakings to help farmers will not have much effect. Because there are too many Chinese farmers, it is impossible to help them with charitable undertakings. They can only be trained to be self-reliant. Regarding charitable social organizations, farmers should be trained to manage their own businesses, and should not be placed under their guidance permanently. However, there is no need to operate too many businesses. The government should not use political coercion for reform undertakings, because the foundation cannot be sustained. China's future progress and the reform and upward movement of life cannot be achieved by government coercion. People must be willing to take this bright path. This requires a long period of education and guidance. Those who train cooperators should take on this responsibility, and they will be able to do it automatically in the future. The government should only use methods of persuasion and assistance, and the results will be great. It is extremely difficult for the government to have a relationship with every person, so there must be an organization. In India, every farmer has legitimate expenses and can borrow money from the government, but very few farmers borrow. This may also be the case in China, because people are afraid of having a relationship with the government, fearing danger. Egypt has an agricultural bank that can lend money to farmers, but after borrowing, they spend it all, and as a result, they sell land to repay the debt. China is also afraid of being in the same situation. There is only one way to make farmers have a group combination, mutually restrain and supervise each other, so as not to waste money. Several countries in the world lend money to farmers, not to individuals but to cooperatives. Commercial banks invest in rural areas. Siam, because it is a small country, directly lends money to cooperatives, but India, because it is a large country, can only lend to federations. China's area and population are roughly the same as India's, so it is best to lend to federations, which is more stable. If the amount of the loan is large, attention should be paid to whether the federation's loan to the cooperative is appropriate and whether its business operations are appropriate. Therefore, the bank should send specialists to the society to inspect. These people should have (1) knowledge of cooperation, (2) business training. The lack of either of these two conditions may cause danger to the bank's loan or to the farmers' business. Because farmers do not know how to keep accounts, and the inspectors themselves do not know it, the bank's investment will be in danger, and the farmers' share capital will also be lost. Not only knowledge of business methods, but also cooperation training is indispensable, otherwise they will not know how to allocate capital. If they do not know the principles of cooperation, they cannot proceed according to the principles of cooperation and will go astray, easily controlled by merchants. Therefore, those who actually guide cooperative work should pay attention to the principles of cooperation and business methods. Now I will talk about the definition of credit cooperation: (1) A credit cooperative is a combination of individuals; (2) The members within the cooperative are all on an equal footing; (3) The purpose is to obtain a kind of capital; (4) The capital can only circulate among the members; (5) The capital loan can only be used for beneficial purposes. There are two aspects to the foundation of credit cooperation, which the instructor should know, namely (1) the character of the members; (2) the management of the society's affairs. (End)</p>

<h3>Eddie Praises Guizhou Politics</h3>
<p>Calling It a Model Province of China</p>
<p>According to the Shanghai Times, Dr. Eddie, a famous American social worker and lecturer, has recently traveled to various provinces in China, engaging in lectures. Based on his observations, Guizhou is truly a model province of China. Therefore, he has written to Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, praising the achievements of the province's officials in striving for governance. Dr. Eddie is currently writing an article, describing his experiences in Guizhou, to be published in an American magazine. Its title is "Is There a Model Province in China?" It is heard that in the letters Dr. Eddie sent to Chiang Kai-shek and Li Zongren, it said that among the provinces his footsteps had reached, "Sichuan is the richest in natural resources, but the worst in governance, while Guizhou is the poorest, but its governance is the best in all provinces."</p>
<h3>Resumption of Northwest Route Still Under Negotiation</h3>
<p>The issue of resuming the Northwest route of the Eurasia Aviation Corporation, since the suspension of flights due to disturbances in Xinjiang Province, has not yet been resumed. Currently, the route can only fly to Lanzhou. The section from Lanzhou to Hami has been suspended for a long time, while the section from Hami to Tacheng is operated by the provincial government itself. In order to quickly restore this route, the Eurasia Aviation Corporation had previously telegraphed the Xinjiang provincial authorities to discuss navigation matters, but has not yet received a reply. Therefore, the company yesterday telegraphed the provincial government again, requesting to agree on a location for face-to-face consultation. The company's general manager, Li Jingcong, will, after receiving a reply, agree on a location and personally go to negotiate everything, so that Eurasia shipping can be completed as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Asks Ministry of Finance, Etc., to Order Courts to Accept Bonds as Security Deposit</h3>
<p>Nationally Issued Bonds Are No Different from Cash</p>
<p>Court Refusal to Guarantee Bonds Has a Great Impact</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Judicial Administration, stating that, "On the 19th of this month, the Timber Industry Association stated in a letter that the credit of national bonds or treasury bills should be stronger than any valuable securities. Therefore, the regulations for the issuance of national bonds or treasury bills clearly stipulate that they can be used as collateral for official guarantees, and it is often stated on the face of the bonds or treasury bills that no agency should refuse to provide guarantees. Unexpectedly, recently, some of our colleagues, when providing guarantees for litigation cases, based on the regulations of the national bonds and treasury bills, provided collateral, but were rejected by the Shanghai District Court and the Shanghai First Special District Court, saying that only cash guarantees were acceptable, which is not in accordance with the regulations of the bond regulations that can be provided for official guarantees, and it is detrimental to the credit of national bonds or treasury bills. Moreover, businesses have limited capital, and all commercial expenses and uses are causing turnover, how can they provide cash, restricting finance? The court's handling of this matter is particularly detrimental to business development. The Chamber of Commerce, in view of this, has specially written to your association to maintain commerce, that is, to request that the Ministry of Finance and Justice be forwarded to order all levels of courts across the country that if litigants provide guarantees with public debt treasury bills in the future, they should no longer refuse to force cash collection, so as to hinder public debt and maintain commerce, to hope for approval, and to quickly forward it, I am grateful, etc.," to the meeting. The national bonds treasury bills issued by the national government all have the following regulations in the regulations at the time of issuance: "This public debt or treasury bill can be used as a reserve fund for banks, and when other official duties require the payment of a security deposit, it can be used as collateral." The four characters of "other official duties" have a very broad meaning, and it seems that they cannot be interpreted as excluding official duties belonging to judicial events. Even according to the provisions of Article 102 of the current Civil Procedure Law, it states, "Those who provide guarantees shall deposit cash or valuable securities deemed appropriate by the court, but this does not apply if the parties have a special agreement." It is the current Civil Procedure Law that does not stipulate that guarantees must be cash. Moreover, the validity of nationally issued bonds and treasury bills circulating in the market is no different from cash, and their credit is far above ordinary valuable securities. According to the association's statement, it seems that the bonds provided by litigants as guarantees have been rejected by the courts, which makes the clause that bond regulations can be used as collateral for official duties almost a formality, which has a great impact on the circulation of national bonds. It is reasonable to report the situation and request that the Department of Justice review and approve the forwarding order to the courts, in accordance with the provisions of current laws and regulations, to accept and collect as usual, so as to maintain national debt credit, which is a public convenience. Respectfully submitted.</p>

<h3>Salvation Army Scheduled to Fundraise</h3>
<p>Enthusiastic Donors Can Send Donations to the North Suzhou Road Office</p>
<p>The Salvation Army has 90 agencies in China, from Shenyang in the north to Hong Kong in the south, with 263 staff members, the majority of whom are Chinese. The relief work it undertakes is the same for all, regardless of Chinese or foreign. It has a relief center for released prisoners in Shanghai. All Chinese who are released from the Huade Road Western Prison are given various assistance. Without the Salvation Army, these people would become homeless and helpless. In 1934, Salvation Army officers personally entered the prison and met with more than 11,200 Chinese prisoners. 499 of those who were released after serving their sentences were given travel expenses to return home, and some were given clothes, jobs were found for them, the sick were treated, and those without food were provided with three meals. A total of 1,548 new cotton-padded jackets were issued in one year. The Salvation Army is doing this in order to prevent these people from falling into despair and repeating their crimes, so as to benefit the city's security and order. It is planned to extend this work to the French Concession Chinese prison in the near future. As for the Huade Road Prison, Salvation Army officers often go there. Now, due to insufficient funds, it plans to start fundraising around March 1. This year's budget for relief work for Chinese and foreigners is 30,000 yuan. It is hoped that benevolent men and women will donate generously. Donations, no matter how large or small, can be sent to the Salvation Army Office at 422 North Suzhou Road.</p>
<h3>Banking Industry Advocates Implementing International Exchange Management</h3>
<p>Financial Advisory Committee Stabilizes Finance Initially</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Plans to Levy Exchange Competitive Sales Tax</p>
<p>Dagon News reports, Since the Financial Advisory Committee organized by the Ministry of Finance was officially established on the 16th of this month at the Ministry of Finance's Shanghai Office on West Ames Road, its first step in planning to stabilize finance is to prepare to implement international exchange management methods. Regarding these methods, the banking industry and the committee have discussed the results, and the Banking Association has submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance to implement the collection of exchange rate competitive sales tax, in order to maintain the balance of international exchange and to serve as the foundation for stabilizing finance. A Dagon News reporter inquired about everything from the banking industry yesterday, and here is a detailed report.</p>
<p>Banking Industry Advocates According to a banking magnate, since Li Ming, General Manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank, advocated exchange management, the general banking industry has expressed its approval. The Ministry of Finance's previous purpose in raising the silver tax was originally to cope with the temporary relief of the turmoil, which is not a permanent strategy for setting the price of silver. Moreover, the silver issue is not a simple monetary issue, but actually contains a relationship of commercial trade. Therefore, in order to absolutely prevent the outflow of silver, it is necessary to save imports. In order to save imports, it is necessary to stop the main source of imports. In recent years, the increase in China's imports has been due to the exchange rate competitive sales policies of various countries. Therefore, the banking industry generally believes that the Ministry of Finance should implement an exchange rate competitive sales tax.</p>
<p>Exchange Management Law As for the implementation of the exchange management law, the Financial Advisory Committee has predetermined three steps: (1) Exempt new silver imports from the equalization tax in order to absorb the input of foreign capital; (2) Maintain the current silver price, or raise it again, so as to maintain the balance between the domestic silver price and the foreign silver price; (3) If the United States still raises the silver price, formulate an exchange management law.</p>
<h3>Shunkang Vessel Damaged by British Vessel</h3>
<p>The Shunkang vessel of the China Pacific Company, loaded with a large amount of timber from Nanyang, arrived in Shanghai on the 15th of this month and stopped at the 92nd river pier in the Huangpu River to unload timber. Unexpectedly, at 12:55 AM the night before, a British merchant vessel named Kaitongto entered the port. When it was sailing near the Shunkang vessel, the Shunkang was hitting the pier. When the British vessel approached, it could not avoid it, causing the Shunkang vessel's left upper deck steel plate and angle iron to be damaged for a total of 12 feet. The guard wood on the left deck was destroyed for 15 feet. After the accident, the shipowner reported it to the company. After asking the insurance company to send someone to check it out, they have filed a protest with the offending British vessel, demanding compensation for the loss.</p>

It was decided to do so. (7) Mr. Wang Yiting, Zhang Xianqing, and Li Shoushan from the Jisheng Association asked to recommend relief distribution personnel. It was decided to do so, and it was stated that public expenses would be paid. The telegram from the association to Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government is recorded as follows: To Chairman Huang of the Hangzhou Zhejiang Provincial Government, I learned from a letter from the Qingpu County Government that hundreds of disaster victims from Haining and Haiyan are begging for food in Qingpu, and have been received and accommodated, please quickly allocate funds to send them back to their hometowns for spring plowing, etc. Therefore, I request to telegraph the magistrates of Haining and Haiyan counties, asking them to quickly send personnel to investigate and find ways to provide relief, etc. Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association Standing Chairman Chu Huiseng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaolai, etc.</p>
<h3>French Tram Company Robbed Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>Four Thousand Dollars Stolen, Fortunately No One Hurt</p>
<p>Robbers Fled Towards Route Conty Without a Trace</p>
<p>At 10:30 AM yesterday morning, at the intersection of Route Conty and Route LUBAN in the French Concession, the French-owned Water and Electricity Company was suddenly robbed by four bandits who opened fire and stole four thousand dollars. Fortunately, no one was injured. The robbers fled towards Route Conty without a trace. The details of the incident are as follows:</p>
<p>Escorting 20,000 Dollars</p>
<p>Tu Jinsheng, the comprador of the French-owned Water and Electricity Company in the French Concession, instructed Qin Rongsheng, a tea server from Changzhou in the company, to escort 20,000 dollars to the bank in the company's official car, license number 1328 in the French Concession and 1886 in the Chinese area, at 10:30 AM yesterday morning. Beforehand, the company's office divided this large sum of 20,000 dollars into two canvas bags, one containing 16,000 dollars in banknotes and the other containing 2,000 dollars in silver coins and 2,000 dollars in banknotes. No sooner had the car driven out of the company gate than</p>
<p>Four Robbers</p>
<p>who seemed to have been lying in wait for a long time, immediately drew their pistols. Two robbers stopped the car, and two robbers rushed into the car and snatched one bag containing 4,000 dollars. Qin Rongsheng, the tea server escorting the money, seeing the situation was bad, quickly threw the remaining bag into the company gate from the car. In their haste, the robbers did not have time to rob again, so they fired two shots into the air as a warning, and then boarded a white-牌 car that had been parked by the side of the road. They forced the driver out and drove the car themselves towards Route Conty</p>
<p>and sped away.</p>
<p>The reporter from the Guowen News Agency arrived at the scene of the incident around 11:00 AM and saw a large number of detectives dispatched by the French Concession Police Station still lingering in the company. They had also taken the driver who had been forced out of the car to the police station for questioning. According to him, his name was Luo Zhixiang, and he was a driver for the Haoyou Automobile Company at 112 Guangxi Road. At 9:30 AM this morning (i.e., yesterday), two young male customers suddenly</p>
<p>Called for a Car</p>
<p>and specified that they wanted to go to Route LUBAN in the French Concession for a round trip fare of two dollars. I (Luo claiming himself) was dispatched to drive a brown sedan, French Concession license number 17625 and Chinese Concession license number 4574. When we reached the intersection of Route LUBAN and Ximen Road, two more people got into the car by the side of the road. I continued to drive to the front of the tram company and parked. One of them told me to wait a moment. I saw all four customers go inside. Not a moment later, I suddenly heard gunshots. I was in a state of panic when one of the customers suddenly approached me,</p>
<p>Drew a Pistol</p>
<p>and forced me out. Because the matter was so sudden, I stood in front of a cigarette shop and waited. After the original car was driven away by the four customers, I was about to report to the police when the police detectives arrived. I was arrested," etc. After the reporter left the police station, he went to the tram company to inquire. According to them, they knew nothing about it beforehand. The company's bodyguards heard the sound and ran out, immediately drawing their guns and waiting in front of the comprador's office on the right side of the second gate. They wanted to chase after the robbers, but unexpectedly, the machinery suddenly malfunctioned, so they did not dare to chase out of the gate. The robbers escaped calmly. The tea server, Qin Rongsheng, took the remaining bag back. Upon inspection, the 16,000 dollars in cash was</p>
<p>Still Safe and Sound</p>
<p>After the incident, the company reported to the police station and requested a search. However, according to a person from a nearby cigarette shop, there were more than two gunshots. Everyone was afraid to look out. After a while, they saw a red car speeding away and turning towards Route Conty. There was a traffic police officer there who was in charge of the traffic lights, but at that time, he did not know what was going on, so even though he had a gun in his hand, he did not dare to open fire easily, allowing the robbers to escape.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang to Go to Russia Today</h3>
<p>Mei Lanfang's acceptance of the invitation from the Soviet Russian Cultural Association has been in preparation for many years and is now finally ready. It has been decided that he will sail to Russia today on the Russian ship Northern. The ship was originally berthed in Pudong, but now, for the sake of convenience, it has been changed to the Beizhan Wharf of the China Merchants Bureau and is scheduled to set sail at 2:00 PM today.</p>
<p>It is also reported that Mr. Mei Lanfang's acceptance of the invitation from Soviet Russia to take actors to perform plays is of great benefit to promoting international culture and developing our country's art. It is said that there are 19 actors accompanying Mr. Mei to Russia for the performances. For the sake of guaranteeing the actors, Mr. Mei has taken out a group life insurance policy for each actor for 5,000 dollars. This life insurance policy is jointly underwritten by the most famous China United Assurance Corporation and China Insurance Company.</p>
<h3>Telephone Company's Request to Increase Prices</h3>
<p>Published by the Public Information Office of the Municipal Council</p>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company's application to revise the rate schedule has been preliminarily considered by the Public Utilities Committee of the Municipal Council. The committee's record was submitted to the Board of Directors for review yesterday (Wednesday). The company's request aims to increase total revenue by 22.89% in order to obtain interest as stipulated in the concession contract (of which 2% is to be used as a general reserve fund). According to Article 13 of the new concession contract signed between the Municipal Council and the company on August 5, 1930, after the completion of the automatic machine conversion, the company should have a net profit income of 8%, plus 2% as a reserve fund. However, it was also agreed that the rate schedule should not exceed the amount recommended in the Anson report within the first three years. The automatic machine conversion was completed on March 27, 1932. Since then, the Municipal Council has approved the collection of fees according to the Anson rate schedule. However, in August 1933, the company requested a revision of the rate schedule due to the discovery of unforeseen circumstances. The Municipal Council then provided financial assistance to resolve the difficulties. At the same time, the company acknowledged that (1) the amount of the price increase should not exceed 25% from April 1, 1935, (2) no further increase should be made before March 1937, and that the contract should be followed thereafter, and (3) if the income exceeds 10% of the capital from April 1, 1935, to March 31, 1937, the contract should be followed. If there is a shortfall, it should be entered under the rate revision account and made up after March 1937. The company claims that it has made every effort to streamline construction and operations without affecting the scope of services. However, the income in 1934 only reached 6.13% of the capital amount. In order to reach the annual profit of 8% plus 2% stipulated in the contract, it is necessary to increase the company's total revenue by 22.89% from April 1, 1935. This increase can be achieved in two ways: one is to universally increase the user's bills by this percentage, and the other is to adopt the principle of charging per call to distribute the cost of telephone calls more fairly. The company believes that the second method is more economical and reasonable, at least for business telephones. In smaller cities, it is sufficient to set a fixed rate for business telephones that is slightly higher than that for residential telephones. However, in large cities, this method makes large users much cheaper, while small users suffer a lot. The fixed rate charging method is easy to cause excessive calls in large cities. As a result, the company's consumption will inevitably increase, and not only is there unlimited calls between users, but there is also no limit to the matter of borrowing telephone calls. As a result, the company's income is lost and expenses are increased. The company's opinion is that residential telephones in Shanghai can temporarily continue to use the fixed rate charging method, while business telephones must be charged according to the number of calls recorded by the register. In 1931, before the automatic machine was converted, the average number of calls per line per day was 7.12 times. Last year, it increased to 14.81 times. The burden on the machine is often very heavy. If it is abused without restriction, the company will have to add another 3.5 million yuan of capital to increase equipment. As for the company's proposed rate revision methods, they are listed below: 1. The original monthly rate for business telephones is reduced from a fixed rate of 12.24 yuan to 10 yuan, limited to 100 calls. After this number, the rate is proportionally reduced, with a minimum of 3 cents per call. This can increase total revenue by 16.488%. 2. The fixed monthly rate for residential telephones is increased from 7.58 yuan to 8.50 yuan, which can increase total revenue by 2.613%. 3. Private lines are calculated based on aerial lines instead of ground lines, and the rates are proportional, which can increase total revenue by 2.579%. 4. The original per-call rate for business telephones is also changed to the first method, which can increase total revenue by 1.545%. 5. The switchboard fee is reduced from 1.47 yuan per month to 1 yuan, which reduces total revenue by 1.429%. 6. The installation and relocation fee is changed from 13.99 yuan to 15 yuan for business use and 10 yuan for residential use, which has no impact on total revenue. 7. The original rate for extension and extension telephones is 2.10 yuan per unit, which is reduced proportionally for more units. Now it is changed to a uniform 2 yuan, which increases total revenue by 0.662%. 8. The private branch exchange is increased by 26.5% to 100% depending on its size, which increases total revenue by 0.461%. 9. The reconnection fee is changed from the original 2.80 yuan to 2 yuan, which reduces total revenue by 0.029%. After the above methods are added and subtracted, the total revenue can be increased by 22.89%. According to the first method, businesses that make fewer calls can pay less than they do now. It is hoped that the number of new users will increase. Also, according to the new method, income and expenses can be adjusted in tandem. In this way, the calculation method of telephone charges can avoid constant changes. Judging from the experience of other places, the number of business telephone calls can be reduced by 50% within two or three years after the implementation of the new method. The burden on those who make the most calls will be greatly increased, but for 65% of users, the price increase will not exceed 15%. The development of housing is still very low in Shanghai, so the price of residential telephones is still kept as low as possible. The various changes proposed by Wang Others are only intended to make the cost of telephone calls more even. According to the company's calculations, after the proposed new method is implemented, an income of about 10.08% of the investment amount can be obtained annually within two years, but it still depends on the development of the entire telephone system and the number of calls. The company also cites the construction and operating costs of other companies for comparison, and the expenses of the Shanghai Telephone Company are not high.</p>
<h3>Notorious Thief Zhou Maoxian Executed by Hanging Yesterday</h3>
<p>Hoped to Write to Family to Take Care of Old Mother</p>
<p>Face Pale, Looked Remorseful</p>
<p>The notorious thief Zhou Maoxian, 49 years old, from Yancheng, was sentenced to death for leading a gang armed with weapons at 7:40 AM on December 3 of the year before last to rob the family property of Mrs. Zhou Yi at 4 Huatongfang, North Xizang Road, and fleeing. When Chinese and Western detectives from the police station arrived to arrest them, the accomplices fled in a hurry from the Manzhou Road area of Zhabei. Police officer Zhang Liankui, number 2073 of the Public Security Bureau, tried to stop them, but he opened fire and refused to be arrested, hitting a vital point and seriously injuring him. He died after ineffective treatment. Later, Chinese and Western detectives from the Hongkou police station found Zhou in the Linchun Tea House on Jiujiang Road, arrested him, and escorted him to the First Special District Court. After a clear confession, he was sentenced to death, which was approved by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and ordered to be executed. Yesterday morning, the police took Zhou from prison and sent him to the Third Criminal Court. He asked to send two letters, one to his brother-in-law Yin Si at the thatched cottage west of the milk shed on Jiangwan Road in Shanghai, and the other to Wang Kaiyuan, the owner of the tiger stove in Zhangjia Lane, north of Xiangyan Bridge, to be forwarded to his cousin Hu Da and two sisters, asking them to take care of his mother. When he was arrested, he had dozens of copper coins with him, which he wanted to use to buy long ingots for burning. He said that it would be best if his sisters were willing to go to the execution ground to collect his body, otherwise they could do as they pleased. When he spoke, his face was pale and he looked remorseful. The court ordered the Chinese and Western police to take him down and announced that Zhou Maoxian was to be handed over to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor's Office for execution by hanging in accordance with the law. He was then escorted along with the entire case file and portrait, and driven to the execution ground of the Second Prison in Caohejing.

According to the law, the body was exposed overnight, and the coffin was collected by the hall the next day.</p>
<h3>Mahjong Gambling Scam</h3>
<p>The Backs of the Tiles All Had Secret Marks</p>
<p>Mrs. Chen Suffered Heavy Losses</p>
<p>—False Report of Robbery Led to the Discovery—</p>
<p>The day before yesterday afternoon, as dawn was breaking, at around 4:00 AM, the Laozha Police Station received a report from Wang Mingde, stating that there were robbers holding weapons and robbing at the Xin Inn at the intersection of Hubei Road and Jiujiang Road, and requesting an investigation. The police chief, upon receiving the report, immediately ordered Western Detective Translator, Chinese Detective Li Shugui, and Patrol Detectives Yang Guanying and Sun Dafa to go there with weapons. According to the report, the robbers were in the corridor in the courtyard. The Chinese and Western detectives saw several people trying to escape and ordered them to stop, but they did not listen. Western Detective Translator then fired a shot as a warning, fortunately without injuring anyone. Later, Chen Axin and Ding Haikang were arrested in the urinal. A mahjong set and a deck of poker cards with secret marks were found on Ding's person. Shao Laishun was also arrested and taken to the police station. After investigation, it was discovered that this case was not a robbery, but a gambling scam to defraud money. Subsequently, gambling offenders Wang Mingde, Yuan Qiaofu, Chen Xushi, Yang Chenshi, Zhou Houfu, Zhou Huaqing, Chen Guitang, Zhang Bingrong, Zhou Huaxiang, Yang Xinlong, Li Jiazhuang, Yang Xieshi, Chen Jinmei, Xu Chenshi, Zhang Liushi (i.e., A Mei), Wang Chenshi, and Chen Weishi, along with the previous Chen Axin and others, for a total of 20 people, were arrested. Among them, Shao Laishun was used as a witness, and the remaining 19 people, including women, were prosecuted for fraud and gambling. It was also found that the group had colluded to defraud Mrs. Chen Ayu of 582 yuan with mahjong tiles with secret marks. It turned out that Mrs. Chen Ayu, a woman from Ningbo, was now 23 years old. She had once been a prostitute in a Ningbo brothel. After becoming a respectable woman, she followed her husband to Ningbo. This time, she came to Shanghai from her hometown on the 11th of this month and opened a room at the Huizhong Xin Inn on Hankou Road. On the 14th, she met her old friend, Mrs. Zhang Liushi, i.e., A Mei, and invited her to her house at 25, Lane 117, Shandong Road, to reminisce about old times. (It was found that Zhang A Mei had been running a Ningbo brothel in Room 136 of the Xin Inn.) Before long, they began to play mahjong. After eight rounds, it was midnight. Zhang saw that Chen Ayu was wealthy and assumed that she had a lot of money, so she invited Chen to Room 126 of the Xin Inn. At that time, there were already people in a room opposite gambling mahjong. Zhang's mother also obtained Chen's consent to join the game and asked Chen to be the banker, while Zhang Liushi joined the stake for a quarter. Chen did not know that there was a scam, and the backs of the tiles all had secret marks, so at the end of one round, Chen lost 220 yuan. After that, she went gambling from time to time, losing badly a total of three times. The second time she lost 225 yuan, and the third time she lost 137 yuan, for a total of 580 yuan. Until the night before last, someone secretly told Chen about the scam. Chen knew that she had been cheated, so she went to Room 261 of the Xin Inn at night to visit Shao Laishun and others, and invited Qiu Yongyu and others to reason with Zhang Liushi, ordering her to hand over the mahjong tiles. Zhang not only refused, but also accused Shao of damaging her reputation and trying to extort 500 yuan. They then began to quarrel and even fight. At the same time, Wang Mingde falsely reported a robbery, which led to the above incident. Yesterday morning, the police escorted the criminals to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated the above situation and said that there was still extortion in this case, so he requested permission to reschedule the hearing. He then presented the dice and mahjong tiles. Subsequently, Chen Ayu and witness Shao Laishun filed a complaint about the previous situation. After interrogating each of the defendants, Judge Ye Shengchao ordered Wang Mingde, Yang Chenshi, and Zhang Liushi to be detained, and the others were released on bail of 50 yuan each, pending a rescheduled hearing next Monday.</p>
<h3>Salvation of Beggars Association Sends Letter to Municipal Public Security Bureau Requesting Assistance in Sheltering Female Beggars</h3>
<p>Directly Send to Hospital for Care to Avoid Complications</p>
<p>Temporarily Suspended Sheltering of Child Beggars to Raise Funds for New Building</p>
<p>The Salvation of Beggars Association, sponsored by the Chinese Women's Temperance Association, has been working hard to shelter women and children beggars since its establishment. It is learned that the Association, in order to expand its shelter, yesterday sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau requesting the arrest of female beggars and sending them to the shelter. However, because the number of child beggars and young children carried by beggar women has reached its maximum, the shelter has temporarily suspended sheltering. It is now raising funds to establish a nursery so that they can be accommodated. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to Municipal Public Security Bureau</p>
<p>The Association sent a letter to the Municipal Public Security Bureau yesterday, which stated, "Sir, we previously received your letter in which you agreed to order your subordinates to assist us as much as possible in sheltering beggars, for which we are very grateful. The Association now reports that the children's department is full. Once funds are raised and a nursery is built in the future, we will carry out a large-scale shelter. We are now planning to shelter and care for single female beggars in the Jiangwan, Nanshi, Zhabei, and other areas. We urge your bureau to order your subordinates to directly send these female beggars to the Shanghai Women and Children's Education and Care Institute on Xiangyin Road, Jiangwan, starting next week, to avoid complications. We hope for your assistance."</p>
<p>Planned Construction of Nursery</p>
<p>According to Liu Wang Liming, director of the Association, since the establishment of the Association to shelter women and children beggars, there have been many people outside who have voluntarily requested shelter, but there must also be many people who have not been sheltered because they do not know the location or the location of the shelter. However, the Association is only run by a small number of women, and it is deeply regrettable that it has not been able to shelter as much as possible sooner due to limited financial resources. The Association has temporarily suspended sheltering due to the full capacity of child beggars. It is now planning to find ways to raise funds to build a larger nursery so that it can shelter as many child beggars as possible.</p>
<h3>Jailers Charged in Murderer's Jailbreak Case</h3>
<p>Suspected of Facilitating Escape</p>
<p>Brought Before the Court for Questioning Yesterday</p>
<p>Murderer Chen Jinlan, a native of Yong, 32 years old, was arrested by detectives from the French police in a rural area of Ningbo for shooting and killing Chen Zhikui, the young owner of Qianfengtai Incense Candle Shop, number 52 Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, on the evening of April 14, 1933. She was extradited to Shanghai and prosecuted by the Second Special District Court. After three trials by the Supreme Court, she was sentenced to 12 years in prison. Chen was detained in cell number 11, East Section, of the Second Special District Court Detention Center during the appeal period and was about to be executed. However, Chen miraculously escaped without a trace between 3:00 AM and 7:00 AM on December 27 of last year. It was not until the cell was opened at 7:10 AM that the guards discovered the escape and reported it to the warden, Gao Xiaoge. The six guards on duty, Yang Xingcun, Wang Guanghe, Fang Yuqi, Han Haorui, Yan Ling, and Zhou Wenjin, were detained and transferred to the Prosecutor's Office of the Second Special District Court for investigation. At the same time, the Gao Third Sub-court Prosecutor's Office was requested to issue an arrest warrant for the fugitive Chen Jinlan. Details have been reported in previous newspapers. This case has been repeatedly investigated by Prosecutor Wang Ren, and witnesses Cai Qinquan, Bai Zengqing, prison staff Zou Lusheng, and Yu Decai have been summoned to the case. After the interrogation and investigation were completed, it was determined that Fang Yuqi (40 years old, from Anhui), the cell guard on duty, and Zhou Wenjin (19 years old, from Hebei), the guard at the main gate and rear iron gate, had neglected their duties and were suspected of facilitating the escape. Therefore, Chen and the two guards, Fang and Zhou, were prosecuted to the same-level court in accordance with Articles 170 and 172 of the Criminal Code. The four guards, Yang, Wang, Han, and Yan, who were found to be unrelated to the case, were ordered to be released on bail and returned to the detention center to serve. Yesterday, Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court specially opened the Fifth Court and ordered the defendants Fang Yuqi and Zhou Wenjin, who were in custody, to be brought in, and summoned witnesses Bai Zengqing, Cai Qinquan, Yang Xingcun, Yan Ling, Zou Lusheng, and Yu Decai, the director and deputy director of the detention center, and guards, to the court for questioning. Fang and Zhou had lawyers Ting Zhu Dianqing and others to defend them. The testimonies of the defendants and witnesses were the same as those in the investigation court. They will not be repeated here. The questioning lasted for one and a half hours before it ended. The court ordered the defendants to be returned to custody, and the witnesses were dismissed to await a scheduled hearing.</p>
<h3>Six Bodies Verified in Deng Tuo Road Fire</h3>
<p>Cause of Fire Under Investigation</p>
<p>On Deng Tuo Road, Deng Tuo Lane, 28 ½ Dai Fu Lane, a fire suddenly broke out at about 2:00 AM the day before yesterday. At that time, the entire houses of 28 ½ and 29 ½ were burned down, and the roofs of 27, 28, and 29 were burned. Six men, women, and children were burned to death on the spot (all residents of 28 ½) and two men were injured. The injured men were residents of 29 ½. After the fire brigade heard the alarm, they immediately went to the scene with Chinese and Western detectives from the Huishan Police Station to put out the fire. After two hours, the fire was extinguished and the dead and injured were sent to the hospital and morgue. It has been reported in this newspaper. It is learned that Detective Li Zhaogeng of the police station has identified the deceased as Zheng Lao Liu, 30 years old, from Jiangbei, residing on the second floor; Tang Er Mazi, 21 years old, and Tang Zhongshi, 18 years old, from Tongzhou, residing in the back hall, a married couple, and a boy who had just been born for more than a month; Li Wentian, 54 years old, and his wife Zhao, 53 years old, residing in the front building. The injured were Tao Han, 30 years old, from Chongming, and Chou Guiyuan, 39 years old, from Anhui. Yesterday morning, the First Special District Court appointed Prosecutor Guo Wei and Doctors Wei and Zhang, as well as Secretary Wang Zuyi, to go to the morgue to verify the bodies. The Western police chief reported the previous situation and said that the fire started at 28 ½, and there were as many as 15 people living in the house. As for the cause of the fire, it is still under investigation. The families of the deceased have all arrived. Prosecutor Guo then briefly questioned the families and announced that the deceased men Li Wentian, Zheng Lao Liu, Tang Er Mazi, and the boy, and the women Li Zhao and Tang Zhongshi, had all been burned to death. The bodies of Li Wentian and Li Zhao were handed over to Cui Guangren, the body of Zheng Lao Liu was handed over to Liu Zhengqiu, and the bodies of Tang Er Mazi, Tang Zhongshi, and the boy were handed over to Tang San for separate collection and burial.</p>
<h3>Two Shops on Fujian Road Closed</h3>
<p>Wei Da Silk Store…Tong Sanhe Southern Goods and Seafood Store</p>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that Wei Da Silk Store, located at the intersection of Four Horse Road and Shilu Road, is a branch of Tianfu Silk Store on Fujian Road. Yesterday, the branch was closed and business was stopped. A notice was posted stating that the store would be merged into the Tianfu Silk Store main store at Shilu Road, Hankou Road. If there are any matters to be discussed, please go to the main store. Tong Sanhe Southern Goods and Seafood Store, a long-established store for decades, has also declared bankruptcy due to poor business in recent years and the shareholders' unwillingness to operate. They also stopped business yesterday. Because the final summary has been completed, the amount owed to others is very small, so they are clearing it themselves and are not hiring lawyers.</p>

<h3>Conspiracy to Bomb the Shun'an Steamer—Three Bottles of Liquid Tested; Results Now Available</h3>
<p>The test results show it was not explosives, but rather refrigeration oil.</p>
<p>Confirmed by Ouyang Tai to be the original items from Chen Youbai.</p>
<p>The Shun'an steamer, owned by the Shun'an Steamer Company, traveling between Shanghai and Xinghua, Fujian, last autumn, loaded goods in Shanghai and set sail for Fujian. When it reached Sanduwo in Fujian, the ship owner Ouyang Tai suddenly reported to the local customs, claiming that the company manager, Chen Youbai, secretly instructed to destroy the ship mid-voyage in order to fraudulently obtain insurance compensation. Unwilling to see the lives of the entire ship sacrificed innocently, he reported the information. After receiving the report, the customs, considering the seriousness of the matter, immediately ordered the ship to be detained, and Ouyang Tai was escorted to the Minhou District Court in Fujian for interrogation and detention. Meanwhile, the company's chairman, Zheng Zhongwu, learned of the situation and reported it to the authorities. Chen Youbai was arrested and handed over to the Second Special District Court. Due to jurisdictional issues, the case fell under the jurisdiction of the Nanshi District Court, so Chen Youbai was transferred to the District Court. At the same time, police were dispatched to the Minhou District Court in Fujian to bring Ouyang Tai back to Shanghai. After clear interrogation, the case was prosecuted in the Criminal Division and has been opened for trial three times.</p>
<p>Due to the complexity of the case,</p>
<p>it has not yet concluded. Details have been previously reported. It is now known that the case was re-tried yesterday at 10:00 AM by Judge Liu Enrong of the Criminal Division (the original trial judge was Chen Jingyi). After the judge took the bench, he ordered Ouyang Tai, who was in custody, to be brought to the stand. Ouyang Tai stated that he was 32 years old, from Fujian, and served as the owner of the Shun'an steamer. He was asked when the Shun'an steamer departed for Xinghua, Fujian. He replied that it was on September 13th of last year at 5:00 AM, departing from Shanghai. He was asked what kind of goods the Shun'an steamer was carrying. He replied that it was carrying soybean cakes, tea, cloth, and the like. He was asked what the tonnage of the Shun'an steamer was. He replied that it was around 1,350 tons. He was asked where he reported the matter. He replied that it was at Sanduwo Customs. He was asked whether he reported it himself or if someone else did it on his behalf. He replied that he went to report it to the Customs Commissioner himself. He was asked to</p>
<p>briefly describe</p>
<p>the situation he reported to the customs. Ouyang replied that around 7:00 AM on September 10th of last year, Chen Youbai came to his house to meet and said, "When the ship sails this time, you must run the ship aground. I have already made arrangements with the customs broker to falsely report that we are carrying 29,722 pieces of cargo. If the ship encounters danger, we can get more than 100,000 yuan in insurance money. Then we can buy a bigger ship, and you can still be the ship owner, and I will give you an insurance policy worth 4,800 yuan as a reward." (The insurance policy had already been filed.) "If you leak the news, I will take your life." On the 12th, he urged him to go to the fifth floor of the Yangtze Hotel to discuss destroying the ship again. In the evening, he was invited to a banquet at the Huichuan Shipping Company. After the banquet, he accompanied him to the Yangtze Hotel and gave him three bottles of explosive liquid. At that time, he vaguely agreed. On the 13th, the ship set sail. When the ship sailed outside the Wusong port, Zheng A'kang, the brother of Chairman Zheng Zhongwu, was on the ship, forcing him to blow up the ship and calling a</p>
<p>meeting of the crew</p>
<p>to have Shan A'kang take responsibility after the ship encountered danger and to allocate one year's salary to each person on the ship. He strongly opposed it at the time. He immediately ordered the telegraph operator to send a telegram to report to the Shanghai Customs, but Zheng A'kang stepped in to stop it. However, the crew knew about the plot to blow up the ship, so when the ship arrived at Sanduwo, he reported the information to the Customs Commissioner. He was asked what evidence he had of Chen Youbai contacting him about blowing up the ship. He replied that the contact was verbal and that he was given an insurance policy worth 4,800 yuan as proof. The judge ordered Chen Youbai to come to the stand. Chen Youbai stated that he was 35 years old and was the manager of the Shun'an Steamer Company. He was asked what he managed. He replied that business transactions and customs declarations were all handled by him. He was asked whether he managed the ship's destination. He replied that it was under the command of the general manager, Zheng Zhongwu. He was asked how much cargo was loaded this time. He replied that it was over 14,000 pieces. He was asked</p>
<p>why he falsely reported</p>
<p>29,722 pieces. He was asked the reason. He replied that the remaining pieces had already been cleared from customs. He was asked, according to the customs, the goods were not cleared, and they did not allow him to clear them. He replied that the customs had already cleared them. If they had not been cleared, the Xinghua Customs would have to detain their ship. He was asked if he knew that the ship was detained in Sanduwo. He replied that he only found out on the 18th. He was asked how long Ouyang Tai had been the ship owner. He replied that he had previously served as the ship owner for three months at the company. Now, he was recommended by Zheng Zhongwu to continue serving as the ship owner. He was asked if Ouyang Tai had any grudges against him. He replied that he had previously suspended him from his position, so he inevitably held a grudge, and their relationship was not very harmonious. He was asked if the three bottles of explosive liquid and the insurance policy worth 4,800 yuan were given to Ouyang Tai by him. He replied that he did not. He was asked if the crew also said that he contacted Ouyang Tai about blowing up the ship. He replied that the crew were subordinates of Ouyang. The interrogating judge said to Chen, "Ouyang Tai earns over 200 yuan a month. Now he is</p>
<p>sacrificing his position</p>
<p>and still suffering. He is not crazy. If you did not contact Ouyang Tai, would he have gone to report to the Sanduwo Customs?" Chen's reply was ambiguous. Next, Zheng A'kang was brought to the stand. He stated that he was 20 years old and currently studying. He was asked if he had a position on the Shun'an steamer. He replied that he did not. He was asked what he was doing on the ship. He replied that he was returning to his hometown to take care of his father's funeral. He was asked if he knew about Ouyang's contact about blowing up the ship. He replied that he only found out when he got on the ship. He was asked how he knew. He replied that the old shipmate told him. He was asked why the old shipmate told him. He replied that when the ship was sailing, he was bored and casually looking around and passed by the ship owner's room and saw many crew members inside talking. When they saw him coming, they were all silent and dispersed. He was asked where he went when he arrived at Sanduwo. He replied that he went to the naval department to report the information to Battalion Commander Li. The next day (i.e., the 16th), he</p>
<p>telegraphed Shanghai</p>
<p>to his brother Zheng Zhongwu. He was asked if Ouyang Tai and crew members Lin Xifan and Wang Jixin all said that he forced Ouyang to blow up the ship. Zheng replied that this was not the case. At this point in the interrogation, Judge Liu ordered the forensic doctor to come to the court to testify. After testing the three bottles of explosive liquid presented in the case, the results showed that it was not explosives, but rather something like refrigeration oil. Judge Liu ordered Ouyang Tai to come to the stand to inspect the three bottles of explosive liquid presented in the case. He was asked if they were the original items. Ouyang inspected them for a long time and replied that they were, in fact, the original items given to him by Chen Youbai. At this point in the interrogation, Judge Liu stated that the circumstances of the case were extremely complicated, and further investigation and witness examination were necessary. The hearing would be continued at a later date. The defendants Chen Youbai and Zheng A'kang were released on their original bail, while Ouyang Tai was remanded in custody pending further instructions.</p>

<h3>Bizarre Incident in Tangqiao, Pudong: Disinterring Graves and Whipping Corpses on Public Cemetery Land</h3>
<p>Heads of the Dead Displayed—a Chilling Sight for Onlookers</p>
<p>The Purpose Is Simply to Hold a Festival to Welcome the Gods</p>
<p>—We Urge the Authorities to Investigate Thoroughly—</p>
<p>Hua Dong News Agency: A ridiculous and bizarre movement has recently occurred in Pudong. The absurdity and cruelty of the event are no different from the actions of primitive barbarian tribes. The incident took place in Tangqiao Township, which is also under the jurisdiction of Shanghai. The instigators were a group of local ruffians. Ignorant villagers blindly followed. The purpose was to promote festival activities in the countryside. The first day of the movement was the evening of the 18th of this month, which was also the Lantern Festival according to the lunar calendar. At 8:30 PM that night, several hooligans suddenly went to the Zhaotianhou Temple in the eastern town of the township and carried out a small statue of the god Zhaotianhou enshrined in the temple. This small statue is used as a pioneer during the festival parades. Immediately, a group of people were gathered, holding torches, and went to the public cemetery about a mile away from the town, called "running the altar." They shouted loudly on the cemetery, their behavior resembling the attendants shouting in the officialdom during the Qing Dynasty, called "calling the hall." After the "calling the hall" was completed, they arbitrarily split the unclaimed coffins of newly deceased people on the cemetery and forcibly removed the heads of the corpses and hung them on the chair of the small statue. According to witnesses, the scene was extremely tragic and difficult to describe. Last night was the second night of "running the altar." They went even further to the public cemetery two miles away from the town and carried out the same actions. The mentality of this group of inhuman people is even more laughable. It is said that collecting a large number of dead people's heads can promote the early spiritual response of the Bodhisattva. Only in this way can the sponsorship of local gentry be promoted by the Bodhisattva's response, and the festival activities can be held as scheduled. Since this incident occurred, a large number of ignorant villagers have followed suit. As a result, the township has been disturbed all night for consecutive nights, and strange incidents abound. The Tangqiao Road Police Station of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau is located in the Tianzhu Temple. The hooligans are afraid of being discovered by the police station, so their actions were very secretive when carrying out the small statue. However, since the movement occurred, the unclaimed coffins in the public cemetery have suffered tragic mutilation after death. It is sincerely hoped that the authorities will quickly stop this absurd act and strictly investigate the ringleaders, so that this barbaric and inhuman phenomenon can gradually subside.</p>

Zhou and Hu's future study and return to China will greatly benefit our country's theater industry. Zhou and Hu both gave replies. Zhou's speech was particularly generous and vivid.

<h3>Hunan Fellow-Provincials Association Discusses the Case of Hunan Disaster Victims Killed by Villagers in Qingpu's Mao Dian</h3>
<p>A Tragedy in Mao Dian: Villagers Kill 55 People with Weapons</p>
<p>Telegram to the Jiangsu Provincial Government Requesting an Investigation and Strict Punishment</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Hunan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai convened an emergency meeting regarding the case of 55 disaster victims who fled famine from Xiangxiang County and were killed by villagers in the Mao Dian area of Qingpu County. Over 200 people attended, including Zhou Zhenlin, Ye Kaixin, Huang Yi'ou, Chen Heting, Shen Zurui, Li Wenhui, Zhou Gengxin, Ye Dingyuan, Ning Chunda, Li Wuyun, Zhang Chunsun, and Xiangxiang disaster victim representatives Li Shiying and Zhou Desheng. Zhou Zhenlin chaired the meeting, and Li Wuyun reported on the incident, stating that on the 15th of this month, the association received a report from Xiangxiang disaster victim representatives Yan Haiqing and Zhou Desheng. They stated that 148 disaster victims who fled famine from that county hired 15 boats on February 12th and arrived in the Mao Dian area. When they went ashore to beg for rice, the Mao Dian villagers not only refused to give them any but immediately beat gongs and gathered a crowd to attack them with weapons, throwing the bodies into the water. A total of 55 men, women, elderly people, and children were killed, and 29 were injured. They requested justice. On the morning of the 16th, the association sent Li Wenhui, Zhou Gengxin, and Zhang Chunsun to investigate and sent a letter to the Qingpu County Government Public Security Bureau, asking for their assistance. They returned to Shanghai on the 18th and reported that the number of disaster victims killed by Mao Dian villagers was confirmed. The county government sent personnel to supervise the undertakers in recovering the bodies, and 42 corpses were found, all with injuries of varying severity. Tragically, there were three corpses of children aged one year, two years, and eight months. The corpses were laid out waiting for coffins, a truly horrifying sight. They also questioned Shi Baoquan and Yang Gengquan, two local villagers aged around 70. According to them, at 9 AM on that day, representatives of the refugees went to Li Gengtang's house in the north of the village to ask for rice. He refused because Xiangxiang refugees had begged for 11 yuan in the village the previous day. So, he beat gongs and gathered the entire village to beat and drive them away, resulting in the deaths of many. They claimed they didn't know anything else. An investigation revealed that after the tragedy, all the villagers fled, leaving their houses and belongings intact. Armed soldiers from the county Public Security Bureau's security team have been sent to protect the area. County Magistrate Qian and Public Security Bureau Chief Huang have promised that the coffins will not be moved until the case is resolved. The fellow-provincials were outraged, saying that the disaster victims were refugees, what laws had they broken? Even if there was any disturbance, the 500-plus households of Mao Dian could have stopped it or reported it to the government, why did they resort to such brutal killing, resulting in 55 deaths and 29 injuries? The investigation revealed that all the houses and belongings were intact, indicating no disturbance. The entire village fled, showing their guilt. It was resolved that the legal aspects would be handled by lawyers Zhang Xingyan, Peng Ximin, and Chen Heting. Representatives will also be sent to Qingpu to negotiate seriously with the county government. On one hand, a telegram was sent to the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating: "Chairman Chen of the Jiangsu Provincial Government and Director of the Civil Affairs Department, greetings. A case of men, women, elderly, and children fleeing famine from Xiangxiang reaching Mao Dian, Qingpu, being killed by the local villagers gathering and attacking them with weapons. These disaster victims suffered such a tragic fate, we are all human beings, how could they be so cruel? The incident is shockingly brutal and horrifying to hear. Our association has sent personnel to investigate and confirmed the details. The large Xiangxiang community in Shanghai is extremely angry. We are telegraphing to your office to dispatch personnel for a thorough investigation and strict legal punishment. More details will follow. From the Hunan Fellow-Provincials Association in Shanghai, Zhou Zhenlin, Ye Kaixin, Chen Jie, Huang Yi'ou, and over 200 others bow in reverence." Photos of the 42 corpses and the 29 injured men and women were taken and printed for distribution, disclosing the details of the tragedy, appealing to all provinces and sectors for justice for the disaster victims, and ensuring that tragedies like the Mao Dian incident do not happen again.</p>

<h3>The Central Political Council Passes the Degree Conferral Law</h3>
<p>Submitting the Articles to the Legislative Yuan for Review</p>

<h3>Education Funding for Various Counties in Zhejiang Province Urgently Needs Relief</h3>
<p>A Calamity the Likes of Which Has Not Been Seen Since the Founding of the Republic</p>
<p>Jiangshan County and Others Have the Most School Closures</p>
<p>(Hangzhou Correspondence) The education funding for various counties in Zhejiang Province has primarily come from the education surtax levied under the land tax. The second source is the rental income from school properties. However, since the severe drought and famine of the summer of the 23rd year, the land tax collection in various counties has been suspended, and the education surtax has been suspended accordingly. The rental income from school properties, which is proportional to the land tax, has also naturally stopped. Even in areas where the disaster affected less than 50%, allowing collection according to regulations, the collected amount is still very limited due to the bankruptcy of the rural economy. According to a reporter's investigation:</p>
<p>Education Funding for Various Counties</p>
<p>Statistics on Revenue Reductions Due to Disasters Showing Over 80% Reduction:</p>
<p>Haining, Dangyang, Lin'an, Xindeng, Haiyan, Tongxiang, Changxing, Nantian, Xiaoshan, Xianju, Pujiang, Jiande, Chun'an, Tonglu and fourteen other counties.</p>
<p>Over 70% Reduction:</p>
<p>Yuqian, Changhua, Wukang, Xiangshan, Shaoxing, Zhuji, Shangyu, Sheng County, Linhai, Wuyi, Longyou, Changshan, Shouchang and thirteen other counties.</p>
<p>Over 60% Reduction:</p>
<p>Hang County, Chongde, Pinghu, Wuxing, Anji, Xiaofeng, Cixi, Dinghai, Xinchang, Tiantai, Lanxi, Dongyang, Yongkang, Tangxi, Qu County, Jiangshan, Kaihua, Fenshui, Lishui, Qingtian, Jinyun, Songyang, Xuanping, Jingning and twenty-four other counties.</p>
<p>Over 50% Reduction:</p>
<p>Yuhang, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Deqing, Ningbo, Suian, Yunhe and seven other counties.</p>
<p>The severity of the disaster is truly shocking, unlike anything seen since the founding of the Republic. Consequently,</p>
<p>Schools Are Unable to Maintain Operations</p>
<p>and closures have been frequently reported. Jiangshan County has the highest number of closures with 86, followed by Dongyang County with 85. Tonglu and Shouchang counties both have 70. The rest range from 5-6 to 50-60 closures. There are also cases where schools have not officially closed, but are effectively empty and unsustainable, with classes long suspended. Therefore, the decrease in the number of students in various counties is also significant. Counties with a decrease of over 20 students include Yuhang, Dinghai, Xiaoshan, Shangyu, Sheng County, Pujiang, Jiande, and Tonglu. Counties with a decrease of over 1,000 students include Shaoxing, Xianju, Yongkang, Jiangshan, Fenshui, Lishui, and Qingtian. It is estimated that the dropout rate in Changhua, Haiyan, Wuxing, Lanxi, Dongyang, Longyou, and Suian has reached over 20%. In addition, there are many others where accurate data is unavailable but the actual decrease is significant. There are also many cases where teachers' salaries are in arrears for three to nine months. In view of the situation,</p>
<p>Education Funding Has Reached a Dead End</p>
<p>The education situation is unsustainable. Unless substantial financial aid is provided, education will be further disrupted, and the future is unimaginable. It is reported that the provincial government considers education to be fundamental to national development and is discussing ways to provide relief by issuing provincial public bonds to establish an education reserve fund for lending to various counties to maintain the precarious state of education. It is also reported that Director Xu of the Education Department believes that borrowing from public bonds is a temporary solution and that if a reliable method of guaranteeing local education funding is not established first, there will be instability every year. He emphasized the need for a fundamental solution and at the provincial government's weekly memorial service on the 11th of this month,</p>
<p>Proposed Five Measures</p>
<p>Hoping that the entire education sector in the province will mobilize to ensure their implementation so that local education can be effectively guaranteed in the future. The education bureaus and county party headquarters of various counties believe that planning for guaranteeing local education funding is urgently needed and consider these measures to be essential and easy to implement. They plan to unite all sectors on the ground to initiate and discuss implementation. The Education Department is concerned that the measures in various regions will be too diverse and that the methods for managing and safeguarding education funds may not be entirely adequate. It is drafting an outline for increasing and reorganizing education funding for various counties and cities to provide guidance.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Plans to Develop Border Education</h3>
<p>Editing Elementary School Textbooks Suitable for Various Ethnic Groups</p>
<p>Establishing Normal Schools to Cultivate Teachers with Pure Ideologies</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that education in China's border regions is extremely backward due to the lack of funds, which prevents development. It has requested the Executive Yuan to allocate 350,000 yuan from the Boxer Indemnity in the next fiscal year to subsidize education funding in border provinces and regions so that border education can gradually develop. A reporter spoke with officials from the Ministry of Education yesterday about the department's recent investigations into the state of education in the border provinces and the planned development measures, as follows:</p>
<p>Current Status of Border Education</p>
<p>Investigations show that Suiyuan, Chahar, Qinghai, Ningxia, Xikang, and Yunnan are important border areas of China. The local governments in these areas either lack foresight or are limited by financial and human resources and have greatly neglected education. Often, there are no government-established schools or schools that use Chinese textbooks for instruction in hundreds or thousands of miles or dozens of counties. With the national crisis so severe, this is a major danger signal. The situation of the mixed population of Mongol, Hui, Tibetan, and Miao peoples in the border provinces and their current educational state are described as follows: Apart from those residing in Outer Mongolia and the three northeastern provinces, the largest Mongol populations are in Suiyuan and Chahar provinces. Since the Qing dynasty opened the border between Han and Mongol areas in the late Qing dynasty, some of the natives have been assimilated by the Han people and are proficient in Chinese. However, this is only true for a small number of intellectuals, and most Mongols still prioritize the Mongol language. According to 1930 statistics, there are only over 800 elementary schools in the two provinces of Chahar and Suiyuan, and most of them are for children of Han people. Very few Mongolians attend. Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Ningxia are areas where Hui people live in concentrated communities, especially Xinjiang. The general population of Xinjiang is estimated at 2.5 million, Qinghai at approximately 3 million, and Ningxia at approximately 450,000, most of whom are Hui. According to 1930 statistics, there are only 5-6,000 elementary school students in school, and Hui children are still a minority. The low level of their culture and knowledge is self-evident. Recently, Russians have taken the opportunity to penetrate the region and entice the youth of the province to study in their country, which is worrying. Xikang is inhabited by Tibetans. Since the British invasion of Tibet, China's political influence in Kang has been hanging by a thread. If we do not pay attention to education and enlighten the people, the future is unimaginable. Currently, there are only over 40 elementary schools, and the number of Tibetan people attending school and receiving education is still small. In Yunnan, the Han population accounts for only about one-third of the total population of the province. A portion of the Mongolian people and the majority of the Miao people live in mixed communities with indigenous ethnic groups, and their knowledge is very rudimentary. According to reports from the Yunnan Provincial Education Department, about 30 counties in the province still do not have government-established schools. Foreign missionaries have recently been gradually increasing their influence in these areas. Recently, French missionaries have established normal schools and set up elementary schools for the Miao people, teaching them with a clear purpose. Previously, the Education Department of the province drafted measures to implement border education in order to remedy the situation, but they have not been able to proceed due to limited funding and a lack of textbooks for language instruction. Given the above situation, the situation in the border regions is deteriorating daily. To strengthen our borders, we must promote education and foster a sense of unity and resistance to invasion. However, the various ethnic groups in the border regions live in mixed communities. Except for a few who have been assimilated by the Han people, most of the people have different languages and writing systems. Without teaching tools, plans cannot be implemented. This has been a shared pain for border education administrative bodies throughout history. Therefore, the fundamental issue should be to pay attention to the editing of special textbooks for various ethnic groups and the establishment of elementary school teachers. The following measures are proposed:</p>
<p>Development Plan</p>
<p>(A) Editing elementary school textbooks suitable for various ethnic groups (1) Key points: The content should pay attention to the inherent characteristics of the ethnic groups, instill scientific knowledge, and include materials on national humiliation and historical figures who defended the country to enlighten knowledge and foster patriotism. (2) Method: First compile three types of textbooks: National Language, Civics, and General Knowledge (including history, geography, and natural sciences). All three should be based on the National Language with annotations in Mongolian, Hui, and Miao languages. (B) Establishing elementary schools extensively (1) Key points: Schools should be established first in the most culturally backward areas of the border regions to train children in basic education and use the schools as centers to instill common sense and patriotic ideas in the general population. (2) Method: Twelve Mongolian elementary schools should be established first, four in the twelve banners of Chahar Province, three in the ten banners of Xilin Gol League, two in the six banners of Ulanqab League, two in the seven banners of Yeke Joo League, one in Alxa Special Banner, and one in Ejina Special Banner. Nine Hui elementary schools should be established first, four in the twenty-nine Mongolian banners of Qinghai, one in the twenty-three Mongolian banners of Xinjiang, and four in the Hui areas of Xinjiang. Four Tibetan elementary schools should be established in Xikang, and ten Miao elementary schools should be established first in Yunnan. (C) Establishing normal schools (1) Key points: Teacher training is the basis of all facilities. Without qualified personnel, it will be difficult to achieve good results. Normal schools should be established in suitable locations in various border areas to recruit outstanding Han and ethnic minority youth, provide them with rigorous training, and cultivate persistent, pure-thinking teachers. (2) Method: Two Mongolian normal schools should be established first, one in Zhangjiakou and one in Guihua. Two Hui normal schools should be established first, one in Xining and one in Dihua. One Tibetan normal school should be established first in Kangding. Five schools should be established in Yunnan, one each in Deqin (i.e., Dunzi), Zhenkang, Cheli, Jinsha River, and Qiuta.</p>
<h3>The Ministry of Education Orders Schools to Enlighten the Public with Scientific Knowledge</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 20th) The Ministry of Education, according to the China Association for the Advancement of Science, states that if the lives of the people are not scientific and production is not improved, the general public will lack the ability to participate in resolving the national crisis and revitalizing the nation. At this time of national difficulty, school staff and students should use their spare time to popularize scientific knowledge to the public so that schools and society are closely linked and people's livelihoods can be improved. As the spring semester begins, an order is issued to all levels of schools across the country to hold at least one public science lecture each month. Primary and secondary schools must also organize science lecture competitions each semester and welcome the general public to attend, in order to improve public scientific knowledge. A special order is issued to universities and colleges and transmitted to all levels of affiliated schools for compliance.</p>

Its immense value in agriculture is undeniable, from family life to construction, from youth education to fieldwork. It is used to promote the application of technology in rural areas and fieldwork and life, and to promote the value of rural life in cities. It is a tool for rural education and can also be used to promote its products. To encourage the production of films most suitable for rural areas, an international rural film competition has been organized.</p>
<p>(2) "Scope of Competition": The competition will reward and widely promote the films that are most successful in addressing the following three topics: A. Films that can best promote the improvement of farms, such as rural construction and architecture, including rural landscapes. B. Films that can best promote the rationalization of rural family management. C. Films that promote the progress of rural education, with special attention to the development of children's character.</p>
<p>(3) "Prizes": The best film in each category will be awarded a Special Prize Certificate. The second-place film will be awarded an Honorary Certificate. The remaining three films of value will be awarded medals. In addition, 4,000 francs will be given to the jury to purchase meaningful films.</p>
<p>(4) "Date": July 23-27 this year. Films participating in the competition will be screened by the organizing committee at the International Exhibition venue.</p>
<p>(5) "Registration": Each country can submit a maximum of two films for competition. It is best for each country to hold domestic preliminary competitions to decide the entries. The registration fee is 100 francs and should be submitted before May 1st.</p>
<p>(6) "Judges": Judging will focus on internationality, with one official representative and one alternate representative from each participating country forming the jury.</p>
<p>The Belgian Committee for the Improvement of Rural Life believes that the future of rural films is extremely promising. At this initial stage, it will take advantage of the competition to organize a temporary exhibition. All materials related to the scope of rural films can be sent for exhibition. Rural areas are currently the most important economic and social issue. Participation in this international competition is an excellent opportunity to understand the rural life of various countries and exchange films, and to encourage development in this direction. It has also been resolved to request central guidance in producing two rural life films to participate in the competition.</p>

<h3>Pan Gongzhan's Speech on Shanghai's School Education (3)</h3>
<p>I believe that China's education, since the rise of schools after the Sino-Japanese War of 1894, has only been around for forty years. And in these forty years of education, only 2.4 percent of the population is enrolled in schools, which is truly absurd. Do we still want to run education in the same way as before? The previous method of running schools was a superficial one. When others had something, we wanted to learn it too. When others had elementary schools, we wanted to have elementary schools too. When others had kindergartens, we wanted to have kindergartens too. When others had middle schools, we wanted to have middle schools too. When others had universities, we wanted to have universities too. Even when others had diploma mills, we wanted to have diploma mills too. It was as if not having what others had was a disgrace, and we didn't even bother to understand what was inside each level of school. Therefore, we fundamentally neglected elementary education, which is a major flaw. Therefore, our future education policy, not just in Shanghai but throughout the country, should pay attention to the issue of "elementary education." This is a major issue for China's "survival," not a child's play. It's not that I'm exaggerating the seriousness of education because I'm in charge of Shanghai's education administration. Even in the business community, the children of those in the business community also need to be educated, and "elementary education" is indeed a basic education that everyone must go through. No matter what field, it must be emphasized.</p>
<p>Some people think that there are already a lot of students now. If we take the ratio, if one out of twenty elementary school students in our country can go to middle school, then we should have 500,000 middle school students now. If one out of ten middle school students can go to university, then we should have 50,000 university students in our country. In the past, those who ran education in our country and a group of students thought that going to school was only to prepare for becoming an official, as if it were still the same as in the imperial examination era. In the past, the "provincial examination" was held once every three years. Usually, a province only selected a hundred or so people, and at most two hundred or so. Some culturally backward provinces didn't even select a hundred people. But now there are about 11 million elementary school students in the country, accounting for 236 out of every 10,000 people in the country. There are about 520,000 middle school students, accounting for 11 out of every 10,000 people in the country. There are more than 40,000 university and vocational school students, accounting for 1 out of every 10,000 people in the country. Perhaps it feels like this number is a lot. But you should know that the purpose of running education is not for students to prepare to become officials in the future. If we run education with this attitude, then we should just close many schools. When the imperial examination was abolished and schools were established at the end of the Qing Dynasty, I heard people say that graduating from higher elementary school was like having the qualifications of a "bachelor" in the Qing Dynasty. Graduating from middle school was probably equivalent to a "recommended scholar" in the Qing Dynasty. Graduating from university was like a "Hanlin scholar" in the Qing Dynasty. Students who returned from studying abroad were considered "foreign Hanlin scholars." Some people made such comparisons, isn't it just like the imperial examination? What I'm saying is not a joke. Even now, there are still such similar situations. Although the titles of "bachelor," "recommended scholar," and "Hanlin scholar" are gone, aren't there still "bachelor's" degrees after graduating from university? And further up, aren't there titles like "master's" and "doctor's" degrees for students who have studied abroad? Although middle school graduates don't have any titles, I have heard that there are still some provinces where, after their children graduate from middle school, the clansmen open the ancestral hall, ask them to worship their ancestors, and even issue announcements. People who run and receive education like this still have such feudal thoughts now. If we turn it around and say that education is to teach people to survive, to teach people to have knowledge, to teach people to have skills, to teach people to have the ability to live, who doesn't want these knowledge, skills, and ability to seek a living and survive? Therefore, everyone should be educated, at least until they have completed "elementary education." Therefore, "elementary education" is also called "compulsory education." There are two aspects to the explanation of "compulsory education": (1) If children reach the appropriate school age and their parents don't send them to elementary school, then the government will force them to go to elementary school, and the parents will be punished. Why? This "elementary education" must be received by everyone, as if it is an obligation. (2) We can also say that "compulsory education" is the obligation of the state. The state should establish more elementary schools so that these children who have reached school age have the right to enjoy this education for free. In short, no matter how you say it, "compulsory education" is a fundamental education. But what is the situation of "compulsory education" in our country now? To this day, "elementary education" only accounts for 2.4 percent of the total population. However, according to the brief report just now, everyone can recognize the trend of Shanghai's education. Although the number of elementary school students is still far from the goal of at least 340,000, the increase in the number of elementary school students in recent years is a relatively gratifying phenomenon. We hope that this phenomenon will continue to develop, and we hope that the strength of all students' parents and all citizens will be concentrated to cooperate with the government and develop in this direction. Whether it is public or private, we will do our best to help. As long as we have a bit of strength, we will do our best. In this way, we will have fulfilled a considerable responsibility to the country, to society, and to this city. Because our strength is very weak at this time, we can only first work hard on running "elementary education." I hope everyone can work together to get this road right first, and then talk about other things. Only by concentrating our efforts on one point can we see results. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Fuchang Closes Long Positions, Gold Price Breaks 900 Yuan</p>
<p>Many Seize the Opportunity to Buy Low</p>
<p>Repeated Rallies Result in a 5 Yuan Drop</p>
<p>The gold market has been declining steadily for days, with no sign of recovery. Long positions are being closed one after another. Unexpectedly, even Fuchang, the last remaining major long player, also closed its long positions yesterday, causing the price to break the 900 yuan barrier repeatedly. However, because the Central Bank continued to support the shilling, there were still many who stepped in to buy long. There were several rallies in between, but confidence remained weak, and the upward momentum was only temporary. Some parties aggressively bought at low prices, eventually leading to a stalemate. The morning started with overseas silver markets rising across the board, exchange rates slightly contracting, and London spot gold rising by three and a half pence. Sentiment continued to trend downward. Off-exchange trading opened lower at 0.034 yuan, and large traders immediately sold, briefly falling to one yuan. Short covering then surged, pushing the price back up to 0.034 yuan. When the Central Bank's exchange rates were announced, both the British and American rates had increased, while the customs gold unit fell by one cent, showing slight weakness. The morning opened with a low, which then turned higher. However, the loose domestic market brought a flood of sellers taking advantage of the high prices, leading to an oversupply. Despite some support at the lows, the price ultimately fell due to overwhelming selling pressure. Retail investors were eager for lower prices, and the 900 yuan barrier was finally broken. Anticipating that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation (HSBC) would not move its rates, the price rebounded. The Central Bank's support of the shilling boosted morale and triggered a rally. However, banks quickly seized the opportunity to sell, and large short players exerted pressure, loosening the exchange rate. Hedgers also came in to sell, thwarting the rally and pushing the price gradually downward, breaking the 900 yuan barrier again. Yifeng, Yongyuanmao, Yongda, Decheng, and other major players vigorously bought bullion, providing support. The Central Bank continued to support the shilling, making a recovery easier, but the rally was only temporary. After reaching a high, the supply of gold increased significantly, causing the price to fluctuate widely. Finally, as the exchange rate strengthened again, the price succumbed to the 900 yuan barrier. Fuchang's closing of long positions was particularly aggressive, but those trying to maintain the price at the lows were also a significant force, leading to fierce struggles. After the market closed, a sudden rally occurred, but Fuchang's continued selling slightly curbed the upward momentum. The half-day market was volatile, with frequent ups and downs, although the range was small.</p>
<p>The morning opened at 903 yuan, down 2.7 yuan from the previous close. Yongli, Yuanchang, and Yongjin were down 4 yuan; Yuanyi, Hengyu, Tongyu, Runfu, Xingyong sold at 2.5 yuan. Macquarie bid for current shilling at 3.125. Hengyu, Yifeng, Yongdafa, Yongfusheng, Yongyuxin, Xiangfu, Xingyong, Yuqingyong, Yongyongli, etc. advanced to 5.5 yuan. Fuan, Xiangfeng, and Yongde sold off, falling to 4.5 yuan. Dadecheng and Dafa Yong advanced to 5.7 yuan. HSBC offered April shillings at 6 pence. Hengyu, Qingyu, Yuanmao, Yonghengchang, and Yongyuxinxiangfeng all sold off, falling to 0.05 yuan. Hengyu, Xiangfeng, Yongli, Yuanchang, and Yongshunli seized the opportunity to buy low at 2.5 yuan. HSBC offered April shillings at 0.0625. Hengyu, Changda, Dasheng, and others competed to sell, breaking the 900 yuan barrier and falling to 899.5 yuan. Dadecheng, Dafa Yong, Fuxingyong, Hengyu, Fuyu, Yuanmao Yong, and others bought in succession. Anticipating that HSBC would not move its rates, the Central Bank forcefully supported April shillings at 0.0625, pushing the price back up to 5.5 yuan. Citibank offered March shillings at 0.125. Qianchang, Xiangfuxing, Yongda, Dalian Bang, Yongli, Yuanmao Yonghengxing all sold. Although Hengchang Yong bought, the price fluctuated downward. Later, April shillings at 0.125 were difficult to sell and fell to within 2 yuan. Yicheng, Dafa Yonghengyu, and Xiangfeng sold even further to 0.03 yuan. Although Hengyu, Dafa Yong, Fuan, and Changda advanced to 1.3 yuan, Fuxing Yonghui, Xiangxianghe, and other retail long players sold even further to 899.9 yuan. Yifeng, Yongda Decheng, Hengyu, and Changda seized the opportunity to buy low at 701.9 yuan. Fuxing Yongda and Dayongli continued to sell within 1 yuan. Later, because the Central Bank again supported April shillings at 0.125, Yifeng, Yongda Decheng, Yuanmao Yong, Fuxingyong, Tongtaichang, etc. advanced to 4.8 yuan. Dafa Yong Yingxiang and others took advantage of the high prices to sell, falling to around 3 yuan. However, because Dadecheng, Yuanmao Yong, Yifeng, Yongchangda, Hongli, Wanchangyong, etc. again advanced to outside 4 yuan, Yuanyi Yuli and others sold, and sentiment was uncertain, falling to 1.5 yuan. However, because the Central Bank was still supporting the shilling, Dadecheng, Tongtaichang, Wanfeng Fuyu, etc. again advanced to 4.8 yuan. Yongli, Dafeng, Yuanmao Yong, and Dafa Yong sold off, falling to 1.5 yuan. Yuanchang Yong Yingxiang still advanced to 3.6 yuan. Citibank offered May shillings at 6 pence. Hengyu, Tongyi, Dafa Yong, Yicheng, Fuxingyong provided supplies in succession and fell to 899.8 yuan. Although Yuanyi Dadecheng advanced to 901.5 yuan, because the bank offered half a yuan of June US dollars, Dafa Yonghengyu and Yuanheng sold to 899.6 yuan. Dadecheng and Fuxingyong still advanced to 901.2 yuan. Fuchang Hengyu sold vigorously, but because Yuanmao Yong, Dadecheng, Dafa Yong, Changda Yicheng, etc. worked hard to maintain, the struggle was fierce, fluctuating around 1 yuan. The noon close was 900.7. After the market closed, although Tongtaichang, Hongxing, and Wanxing sold, Dafeng, Yuanheng, Tongfu, Hengyu, Dacheng, Yifeng, Yongshunli, Yongli, etc. bought in succession and rose to 5 yuan. Fuchang, Hongxing, and Dalian Bang came to supply and fell to within 3 yuan. Tongtaichang and others still advanced, lacking sellers, and finally rose to around 5 yuan again. It was found that the highest price during the half day was 905.7 yuan, and the lowest price was 899.5 yuan, with a fluctuation of 6.2 yuan. As a result, it fell by 5 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was about 41 yuan lower than the Central Bank's gold standard price of 942.2 yuan. There was little difference compared to the previous close. The March settlement was 890 yuan, and the April settlement was 901 yuan. The morning water supplement was 882 yuan. The price of red gold was reduced by 5 yuan to 898 yuan. The spot market continued to be sluggish, with no head or tail in supply and demand. Tianjin goods were marked up by 1 yuan, but there were no transactions. Swap rates continued to weaken due to the fall in gold prices. (Currently, swap rates will follow the money supply and gold prices, and the standard gold price has fallen back to 900 yuan. If the swap rate is 10 yuan, the monthly interest rate is already more than 1 cent.) Hengxing gave 14 taels to Fuyu, and Hengyu gave 7 taels to Qianchang Xiang, all at 10 yuan. It was also heard that Fuyu had also given out 28 taels at 10 yuan, but the transaction was not smooth.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was mediocre. Fuchang, a major player, closed long positions, while those who deliberately went long at low prices were very powerful. In summary, Yifeng, Yongda Decheng, Yuanmao Yong Yicheng, Huixiang Shunfa, Hengchang Yong Renfa, Yongqing Fa, Yong Shenkang, Dafa Yong Yuanchang Yong, and Tongfu were on the buying side; Fuchang Hengyu, Yiyu Wanxing, Tongtaichang, Neixing Yuqing, Yongshunli Hongxing, Yuansheng Yong Yuanyi, Fuxingyong, etc. were on the selling side. Yuanchang Yong Yuqingyong and Hengyu advanced and then exited; Yicheng Hengchang Yong and Tongtaichang, etc. exited and then advanced. Dalian Bang and Wanxing together traded more than 1,400 taels, netting more than 600; Shunli together traded more than 1,000, netting more than 300; Guang Bang Hengxing traded scattered lots, Shengda netted more than 100.

The exchange market opened in the morning with the recent selling price of British exchange at one shilling six pence two five, and American exchange at 37 yuan one two five. Compared with the previous close, the British was flat and the American was tight by 0.0625. After opening, the banks still supported the rate by buying at a cheap price due to the influence of Chinese merchants, which was able to maintain it. Helplessly, Chinese merchants were extremely difficult to boost, and the bank sold slightly to take advantage of the situation, which soon loosened. It was predicted that the HSBC British and American exchange rates would both be flat. The Central Bank came to support the shilling, and there was considerable fluctuation. The balance tax on silver was announced to be unchanged, with no significant impact. After entering, Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu and Fuchang were willing to sell shillings, and the Japanese banks seized the opportunity to sell American exchange, and the process finally hardened. However, because the Central Bank was still supporting the shilling, there was considerable struggle in the middle, but at noon the process remained loose. The noon close recent selling price was British exchange at one shilling six pence three seven five, and American exchange at 37 yuan and a half. Compared with the previous close, the British was loose by 0.0125, and the American was tight by 0.03125. Chinese merchants continued to sell more than 300,000 yuan of American exchange and 50,000 pounds of shillings. The Central Bank still supported the shilling far into the future, but slightly sold recently. Sassoon slightly absorbed the shilling far into the future. The half-day transaction record is listed below.</p>

<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>With the Settlement Period Approaching, Swap Trading in Government Bonds is Busy</p>
<p>Market Prices Vary... More Gains Than Losses</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, with only two or three days remaining in this month's futures, trading was relatively lively. Both long and short sides engaged in swap trading enthusiastically, with short-side swaps being more prevalent. This helped maintain market prices from falling. However, the 23rd level was still a major source of turmoil. It was rumored that banks had goods to settle, while those raising prices continued their efforts. Fortunately, with little remaining in this month's trading, special squeezes may be avoided. Starting today, with only two days remaining in February futures, market prices may still exhibit a vague and uncertain image. Yesterday's proceedings saw varying market prices for common bonds in both the morning sessions due to different choices of swaps, with gains generally outweighing losses. However, the turmoil at the 23rd level remained severe. The first session in this month started peacefully, but in March, through the lifting by No. 4 and others, it surged wildly by 1.5 yuan, seemingly due to the excessive drop the previous day, necessitating another lifting. The second session continued to raise this month by more than one yuan, with long-term futures returning to stability. The difference between near and long-term futures was a significant two yuan. The afternoon opening saw most bond markets trending firmer, with the 23rd level falling slightly by 0.3 to 0.5 jiao. Closing prices showed mixed highs and lows, with minimal fluctuations. The 23rd level, however, fell by 0.7 to 0.8 jiao. Market prices generally ended slightly better, ranging from 0.05 to 0.4 jiao. The total trading volume was approximately 15 million yuan. The gains and losses are listed below (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>New York Stock Market Drops Sharply</p>
<p>Government Bonds Rise Alone</p>
<p>According to a report from Xinfeng Foreign Firm, yesterday (19th), the New York stock market showed a downward trend due to a lack of demand. Speculators felt uneasy about the proposals of Senators Taft, Wheeler, and LaFollette. Taft's proposal stipulated using US government bonds as compensation for veteran soldiers. Wheeler proposed a progressive tax on companies, with a 2% tax on capital net worth for companies earning 3 million yuan, and a 25% tax on capital net worth for companies earning 50 million yuan. LaFollette's proposal stipulated banning public securities companies. Buyers from the previous day closed out their positions yesterday, causing the market to gradually decline after opening flat, with few rebounds. Compared to the peak of the previous day, it was about 1 to 6 yuan lower. The US dollar exchange rate also strengthened. In the bond market, US government bonds rose, with the Treasury's gold and non-gold bonds performing particularly well. Other bonds fell due to long-side profit-taking. Small exchange votes were stagnant and mixed. Chicago wheat also fell, as expectations of expanding external demand were not realized, and long-side profit-takers eagerly closed out positions. The total daily trading volume was 1.1 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left:</p>
<h3>Cotton Yarn</h3>
<p>The Decline in Cotton Yarn Intensifies</p>
<p>The cotton yarn market is trending weaker, and the decline has intensified significantly. The environment has deteriorated, the money supply remains tight, and the issue of yarn delivery for this month is still uncertain, causing anxiety among long players. In the afternoon, one company continued to close out positions, making the market feel even more panicked. This month's price broke through the 177 yuan barrier.</p>
<p>This Month's Cotton Yarn Enters the 77 Yuan Barrier</p>
<p>The opening of the yarn market this morning saw the short-side of a certain company chopping off yet more positions in view of the fall in the price of American cotton, and as a result the market appeared weak, with a lack of buying, making the fall more rampant. Prices for each month fell between 1 and 6 jiao. It was said in the afternoon that the gold market was still weak, and on opening, Yuda bought this month’s batch at the limit price of 7 yuan, and the false air of weakness settled somewhat, but by the third round of bidding, sales were erupting, and the price for this month's batch broke 7 yuan, finally resulting in nearby months falling by between 5 and 6 jiao, with farther months falling between 1 and 2 jiao. On inspection, Mingde sold 1,650 bales, Shenchang sold 1,350 bales, Yida sold 1,000 bales, Shengyuan sold 950 bales, and Yuan Yi sold 1,350 bales, while Gengfeng bought 1,350 bales, Maoji bought 750 bales, Yuanda bought 1,600 bales, Jinchang bought 1,050 bales, Junchang bought 750 bales, Yichang bought 1,000 bales, Changfeng bought 1,450 bales, and Changyu bought 600 bales. The highest, lowest and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>930 Bales of Raw Cotton Were Transacted</p>
<p>Sales of raw cotton are still good, and on inspection, a total of 930 bales were bought by all kinds of groups, and the market price fell by 50 cents, and the volumes of each group are as follows:</p>
<p>After two days of fluctuation, the price of cotton fell with particular vehemence. With the verdict on the gold bar case, the price of American cotton continued to fall, and the price of gold broke the 900 yuan barrier, and some cotton trading firms continued to chop off long positions, and the table was particularly loose, and the market became more panicked. In short, there is too much cotton in storage.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Fell by 40 to 50 Cents</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton market this morning, prices for each month were declining, and there was particularly strong pressure to sell, because the price of American cotton had continued to fall and the price of gold had broken through the 900 yuan barrier, resulting in a new low, and the long positions of certain cotton trading firms continued to be chopped off, so there were plenty of chips available at the table, and the decline was sharp, with each month falling by between 35 and 40 cents. On opening in the afternoon, the price rose slightly by 10 cents. By the second or third round of bidding, word came that the dark market price for Indian cotton had fallen by 1.25 rupees, and pressure to sell continued in the market, and the price of each month fell by between 5 and 10 cents, but Yuanda switched from short to long. On inspection, Run Kang sold 5,100 dan, Renfeng sold 1,400 dan, Dafeng sold 2,600 dan, Jifeng sold 2,300 dan, Daji sold 1,900 dan, Mingde sold 1,600 dan, Hexing sold 2,000 dan, Changfeng sold 1,000 dan, and Xiecheng sold 1,700 dan, while Yuanda bought 8,700 dan, Changfeng bought 2,400 dan, Yichang bought 2,600 dan, Tongfu bought 1,800 dan, Jinchang bought 3,600 dan, Taixing bought 1,600 dan, Senkang bought 2,300 dan, Changhe bought 6,800 dan, and Shenji bought 1,000 dan. The highest, lowest and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Factories Have Little Raw Cotton</p>
<p>Consumption of raw cotton has become sluggish again, and factory needs are quiet. In terms of supply, there were 100 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Exports Are Subdued and the Price of American Cotton Has Fallen Again</p>
<p>The market for American cotton this morning opened on a peaceful note, with the price of each month falling by 1 to 5 points, and then the market fell due to bad news from Liverpool, with the price of wheat and stock prices falling, and in particular long positions for the March batches were being chopped off, and European merchants were selling, so prices were softened step by step, and others bought when prices had fallen, and needs were quiet, with everyone generally waiting for developments in business prospects. In terms of spot prices, local factories still had good demand, and exports were subdued, and the textile industry remained firm, and in conclusion the market was flat and tired, with spot prices falling by 15 points, and futures falling by between 9 and 14 points. English cotton performed well due to the ruling on the gold bar case favouring the long side, with spot prices rising by 5 points, and futures rising by 6 to 7 points. Indian cotton was unable to rise significantly, due to the long side chopping off positions and Japanese trading houses selling the July batch of Bailuoxi, and in conclusion Pingguo rose by 2 rupees, Aomula rose by 2.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 1.625 rupees. The original telegram record is left. (Telegram of the 19th).</p>
<p>And according to a telegram from Mumbai, the forecast for the opening price of Bailuoxi cotton on the 20th was 248.5 rupees, a fall of 1.25 rupees compared to the closing price for the previous day.</p>
<h3>Grains</h3>
<p>The Post-Market for Futures Flour Is Slightly More Promising</p>
<p>After the flour market opened this morning, the various months mostly showed a stable trend. With the price of foreign wheat quoted, Chicago was down by 10 to 20 cents, while Canada had no quotation. When the price was opened, the price for this month's batch had fallen by one cent because the quotation for foreign wheat was low. However, for the March batch and later, people outside the trade were rather optimistic, and purchases for each month also saw a brisk trend. Therefore, at a time when the orders for foreign wheat were lively, the market was still able to hold firm. When it came to the opening this afternoon, the various months' markets were rotating, and although the factories were selling continuously, users outside the trade followed up without retreating, and so the market appeared slightly more promising. Currently, raw flour is still squeezed tight, but the standard floating price has been spat out, so it cannot provide a boost. As a result, this month's batch was slightly smaller by 2.5%, the March and April batches did not move, the May batch was better by 2.5%, and the June batch was better by 0.5%. The July batch was better by 1%.</p>
<p>The Future of Wheat Maintains Its Inherent Situation</p>
<p>Yesterday, both the morning and afternoon openings of the future wheat market saw the various months mostly exhibiting a calm demeanour. With the price of foreign wheat quoted, Chicago was down by about 10 to 20 cents, while Canada did not move. When the price was opened, transactions for each month saw rotation. With the continuous ordering of foreign wheat, there was no reason for the market to look good, but at the current time the flour and wheat markets, from the standpoint of producers, appear to be seeing cheap wheat and expensive flour, and so as soon as there is such a price squeeze, the market is immediately cast off. As a result, this month's batch was 1% better, March's batch was 1% smaller, April's batch was 1% better, the raw wheat market remained stable, and demand from factories continued. The opening price for Shandong Dangshan wheat was 3.95 yuan, and the opening price for Gaoyou wheat was 3.88 to 3.89 yuan, with 500 bales going to Shenda, and 3,000 bales going to Fuxin.</p>
<p>Foreign wheat has been bought by factories when prices have fallen, but no one is willing to follow up.</p>
<p>The General Trend of River Rice Is Stable</p>
<p>(South of Shanghai) Yesterday the source of supplies from various groups was still only about 20, (with goods totaling nearly 4,000 shi,) and the market shape continued to be slightly tight, because arrivals were rare. Prices for the various kinds of goods rose slightly by several cents, but looking at the general situation, the market belonged to that of being dull. Prices for the high-priced thick geng rice rose by several cents, approaching 10 cents, while prices for the middle market saw stability. Demand from Beijing and Yantai groups for late indica rice was for a total of about 600 to 700 bales, and the market was merely rising by 5 cents at most, transforming from an uncertain situation to one of stability. There was no market at all for Du Yangjian rice, which was completely absent.</p>
<p>(North of Shanghai) Yesterday there were 23 or 24 arriving ships from the rivers below, and sales of various goods on the market were subdued. Prices for the market-standard thin rice were about 10 cents. Factories have large amounts in storage, and sales are poor, and the trend for prices to continue to soften. High-grade white geng rice saw sluggish sales and tired prices, prices for the middle grades were seeing stability, and prices for the next tier were raised slightly by 5 or 6 cents, and the prices for the remaining grades were in a stable formation.</p>
<p>Both Domestic and External Sales of Bran Are Quiet Again</p>
<p>The bran market has moved into a steady state, because suppliers inside the country have slightly suspended their orders, and Eastern Zhuang is also rarely inquiring. From the perspective of each factory, sales of raw flour have activated demand, and the amount of bran being produced has also been increasing, so the price being shouted out by each stall on the market yesterday was still 2.75 yuan, without much change from before.</p>
<h3>Oil Market</h3>
<p>Foreign Firms' Supply of Tung Oil Uninterrupted</p>
<p>Domestic Sales Exceptionally Sluggish</p>
<p>Following the settlement of accounts for tung oil, foreign firms in Hankou briefly experienced a lull, potentially easing market conditions. However, the arrival of goods has not significantly increased, and previously sold futures contracts are continuously reaching maturity, keeping prices stable. Only March futures experienced a slight dip to 29.8 yuan, while spot oil remained at 30 yuan, with little available. Recently, the situation in Hankou has remained strong. Although foreign firms are only handling dozens of tons, prices have already increased to 30.03 yuan net, indicating that prices cannot fall further. It is reported that prices for tung oil in Xiangtong, Hankou, are around 25 yuan, and it is said that supplies are not increasing. Traders are hesitant to sell to foreign firms, suggesting that tung oil from Hankou may not enter customs at 30 yuan after all. As for transactions by foreign firms in this port, exports have reached tens of thousands of tons annually in recent years. The sole source is Zhejiang, although some supplies from southern Anhui are transported through Zhejiang, the overall quantity is small. Therefore, exporters in Shanghai dare not sell too much. Although transactions of two to three hundred tons were seen last winter, this was at the beginning of the season. Normally, such large transactions would be unlikely, as Zhejiang's production is insufficient to meet Shanghai's foreign sales. Even if production increases in the coming years, demand is also increasing daily. Recently, the market price in Hangzhou is over 31 yuan per dan, while foreign firms offer only a little over 32 yuan, making foreign trade difficult to initiate. Domestic sales are particularly slow this spring. The drought in Zhejiang, an area of disaster, means no one is interested, as expected. Sales in Jiangsu are also less strong than in previous years, so the decline in domestic sales, compared to previous years, is a stark contrast.</p>

<p>Random Notes</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Shen Shou Ruo)</p>
<p>The government has explicitly banned the old practice of calling officials "Master," but people still do so secretly. One official secretly took a concubine. Upon entering the house, the concubine was instructed to kowtow to the first wife, making it difficult for the first wife to object. However, the concubine was, of course, very reluctant and, upon entering the room, began to fuss and complain to the official. Fortunately, the official had a sudden inspiration and kowtowed to the concubine as well, which appeased her anger. It is said that this is one of the secrets to taking a concubine, called "balancing the accounts."</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Sun Pinglv, is friends with Deng Fenweng, the main organizer of the Crying Society. When he returned during the winter vacation, he happened to mention Deng's recent situation. According to him, he encountered Deng Fenweng previously, and during their conversation, Deng planned to name his study Pan Studio, his poetry collection Donkey Collection, and his hall Little Leisure Hall. When asked about the meaning behind these names, he said that old novels often contain the phrase "Pan, Donkey, Deng, Little, Leisure." His surname is Deng, which has a connection to four characters in this phrase. Therefore, he jokingly used it to name his residence and poetry collection. This old man's actions can be described as amusing.</p>
<h3>Lantern Market in Taixian County</h3>
<p>— Yun Sun</p>
<p>Taixian County used to be called a prefecture. It was downgraded to a county after the founding of the Republic. In the era of the imperial examinations, there was a distinction between prefecture exams and county exams. Taizhou at that time could be called the second-best in Yangzhou. Taixian County does not have many kinds of products, but "Taizhou Lanterns" and "Small Stone Mill Sesame Oil" are refined products that enjoy a good reputation in the Jiangnan region! Therefore, even today, the lantern market is still the best in the eight counties. The lanterns in Shanghai's amusement parks are mostly crystallizations of craftsmanship. However, the "elegant but not extravagant" gauze lanterns are still first-class products of Taizhou. According to legend, there used to be a "gauze lantern" that, when lit, did not cast a shadow. Who knows what broke the feng shui? This intangible relic has only been transformed into a topic of conversation after tea and wine. The Spring Lantern Festival, from the thirteenth to the eighteenth day of the first lunar month, is when many hundreds of craftsmen make a living. They first construct the framework of the lantern and then engage in pasting and mounting work at the end of the year. It goes on the market on the fifth day and ends on the thirteenth. Slope Street, from Zhongshan Gate to Dangjun Building, is crowded every day, forming a line of lanterns, a universe of lanterns. Flying birds and walking animals are for children to play with, while "crowns," "belts," "boats," and "pomegranates" are for good luck. A Ming Dynasty prime minister's hat, a jade belt, a painted boat, and a pomegranate make up a set of lanterns filled with feudal flavor. Literary people and scholars buy two-colored wall lamps, also known as revolving lanterns. Kongming playing the "Empty City Stratagem" and Zhao Zilong fighting at "Changban Slope" are all taken from the Romance of the Three Kingdoms. Uncles and aunts buy lanterns for their nephews, and parents buy lanterns for their newly married daughters. These are unbreakable customs. There is a saying that "you can't raise a servant girl," probably because people dislike these trivial etiquettes. Visitors who have seen the screen lanterns at Guandi Temple and Yue Tomb then turn to the lantern market to buy a few sets of lanterns. The lantern market ends after the "old face lanterns" are sold on the thirteenth day. Under the moonlight of early spring, silver is spread across the earth, and children throughout the city light all kinds of lanterns, forming a transformed art exhibition of lantern craftsmen.</p>
<h3>Sketch of a Gambling Den</h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>Changfa Tea Garden is where "yin energy" concentrates in our countryside. Every Lunar New Year, it is customary to have a lively celebration!</p>
<p>In the southeast corner of the tea garden, a pile of human bodies stacked like Arhats. The noisy voices made it impossible to distinguish what they were arguing about!</p>
<p>"Shrink your hand... Shrink... Your hand!" Zhang Dagou, sitting to the right of the dark-skinned man from Jiangbei known as Lao Si, shouted loudly. A melon-rind cap was tilted on one-fifth of his forehead, truly giving him the air of hair standing on end in anger!</p>
<p>Jiangbei Lao Si raised the two dice high and threw them onto the table on the last syllable of Zhang Dagou's shout "Catch... Eat"! Zhang Dagou followed with a shout of "Nine"! What followed was a powerful "Sweep the pot"! In these few seconds, the tense atmosphere locked the mouths of all the gamblers, and the air was strangely silent!</p>
<p>"Ah! Jiangbei Lao Si has another dud ten!" The gamblers' mouths were freed! Laughing! Shouting! Their hands were busy scooping up the silver dollars being paid out!</p>
<p>"Waiter... Wring out a towel!" Jiangbei Lao Si shouted anxiously, his face dark and red, unspeakably ugly.</p>
<p>Zhang Dagou, puffing out his cheeks, stood up abruptly, grabbed the melon-rind cap and slammed it on the table, shouting a string of requests to the waiter to burn paper ingots! To ward off ghosts!</p>
<p>Then, a blaze of fire rose in front of the Changfa Tea Garden, and the smiling faces of the gamblers gradually disappeared in the firelight!</p>

<h3>Old Goods Peddler</h3>
<p>— Long Dan</p>
<p>According to a person who carries an old goods load, there are three thousand old goods loads in Shanghai. I don't know if this number is accurate, because no one has officially investigated it. However, I feel that their number is indeed very large. Whether it is sunny or cloudy, you can find their traces in the streets and alleys.</p>
<p>Most of the people who do this business are from Jiangbei. They carry two balanced bamboo baskets to buy old goods everywhere, and then carry the gathered goods to the old goods tea party for sale, or carry them to the market (meaning selling to colleagues).</p>
<p>"Birds of a feather flock together." The old goods peddlers also have gatherings (they call them tea parties). In Zhabei alone, there are two old goods tea parties: in the morning, they are all on Xin Jia Road, and in the afternoon, they are all on Da Tong Road. There, the items they display are very rich. Whether it is ancient and modern calligraphy and painting, seasonal clothes, household utensils, and other miscellaneous items, they are always all available. And they are also very accommodating with the price. Often, after bargaining for three to five yuan, they will make a deal with you after a few cents.</p>
<p>They also use a secret language when trading with colleagues. Usually, they use "口, 人, 工, 比, 才; 爲, 春, 本, 金, 石," (transliteration) to represent "一, 二, 三, 四, 五, 六, 七, 八, 九, 十." Ten characters. For example, to say one yuan, they say "口字洋錢"; three jiao is called "工角", five hundred cash is called "才百錢", and others are not listed in detail.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Nine: Failure to Return Home Due to Inept Flattery and Deceptive Exaggeration</p>
<p>The Hu family, supporting the wall, walked to the front room of Cheng Zhi. Besides the host, there was also a man and a woman. The man was wearing short clothes and had his chest open. The Hu family understood that this was called Western clothes. The woman was hard to explain. Her face was also covered with rouge and powder. Her hair was puffed up, with many curls piled high on her head, somewhat like the Western women on cigarette cards. She wore a green long dress that dragged along her heels. Under the light, it glittered with gold. She had never seen such a thing in her life. Could it be the Dharma robe bestowed by the Goddess of Mercy in the drum songs? Moreover, her appearance was even stranger. Such a long dress, but the sleeves were so short, almost short to the armpits. As soon as the Hu family stepped into the door, supporting the wall, she took in the woman completely. Although Yueying was a little more sensible, she didn't know the rules that servants should observe when meeting their master. So after she entered the room, she only called out "Master Cheng" to Cheng Zhiqian, and then said "We are here." The man was fine, but the woman, because the Hu family was staring at her, was already full of anger. She first made a sound of disapproval, turned her head and said to Zhiqian: "Mr. Cheng, are you introducing this kind of person to work for me? This woman's dead eyes stared at me without blinking, how annoying, three parts not like a person, seven parts like a ghost, not having any manners when seeing people, and supporting the wall without letting go." The man smiled and said: "How can she not support the wall? Her three-inch golden lotuses can't stand up." The woman said, her eyes already shooting at Yueying, sniffing and nodding: "This child, if bought to be a maid, might be trained after two or three months. What's the use of this small-footed woman?" The woman was standing, but she crossed her legs while speaking, looking very imposing. The Hu family could see through her. However, seven or eight out of ten of her words were spoken with a southern accent, and she didn't understand them very well. (One Three Eight)</p>
<h3>Records of Imperial Fragrance飘渺</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shou Ou</p>
<p>Fortunately, she immediately expressed her approval upon hearing it, which greatly calmed my mind. Moreover, as she walked towards the place where the opera was being performed, she enthusiastically told me the plot of the play "Si Lang Visits His Mother" in detail. Actually, since I knew about this play, how could I not know the plot? However, the Empress Dowager absolutely didn't care. She always liked to act like an old woman, treating every little detail as a new piece of knowledge, a new invention, and telling it to others in a solemn manner. And the listeners, intimidated by her accumulated power, even if they really didn't want to listen in their hearts, couldn't help but pretend to be very interested and listen attentively. If they didn't do this, or couldn't help but laugh, it would be a great breach of etiquette! So we were all used to this kind of forced listening and would no longer annoy her.</p>
<p>But in all fairness, although she seemed to have too much interest in telling stories, often forcing people to listen, she was indeed talented. A very ordinary story, after she told it, would be much more moving than the original. Whether it was the first, second, or even the fifth or sixth time she repeated the story, it would never lack any excitement, so sometimes we did listen with great interest.</p>
<p>Before long, we arrived in front of the stage. The Empress Dowager sat down on the throne placed in the center, and we all stood on both sides behind her, as usual. I looked up at the stage and couldn't help but admire the abilities of the eunuchs. They had managed to clean up this dilapidated stage in a very short time and had tried their best to imitate the style of the one in the Summer Palace, almost imitating it by three or four points.

<p>Small Recipe</p>
<h3>New Year's Desserts</h3>
<p>— Zhu </p>
<p>During the Lunar New Year, every household, due to the visits of relatives and friends, some refined families prepared various soups in addition to desserts, such as "Date Lotus Seed Soup" and "Lotus Seed Soup," to entertain guests. Small households also prepared a few kinds of desserts to satisfy guests' hunger. Because of social customs, it is impossible not to eat some food when visiting someone's home for the first time during the New Year. Thus, desserts have become an essential food for every household.</p>
<p>Suzhou families prepare approximately the following types of desserts:</p>
<p>Cake Suzhou people love to seek good fortune. Because the pronunciation of "cake" contains the auspicious meanings of "happy and prosperous" and "prosperity and good fortune," cake becomes the main item among New Year's desserts. There are also several kinds of cake, such as yellow and white New Year cake. Cut into pieces, it can be used to make cake soup. Cut into slices, it can be used to stir-fry New Year cake. Lard cake also comes in several flavors, such as rose, mint, jujube paste, and white sugar. Cut into thin slices, steamed, boiled, or stir-fried, it is sweet and very flavorful. Song cake is also very delicious. There is also a kind of "Ningbo New Year Cake," white strips, cut into small pieces. It can be used to cook soup with dried shrimp and winter bamboo shoots, and it can also be stir-fried with lard and shredded meat. It is also a very good savory dessert.</p>
<p>Steamed Bun Because of the saying "Prosperous Steamed Bun," steamed buns have become a dessert representing the auspicious meaning of prosperity. Among New Year's desserts, it is absolutely indispensable. This kind of steamed bun uses unleavened flour. The skin is thin, the meat is large and juicy, and the taste is very delicious. When people eat it, some steam it and some deep-fry it, depending on the guest's preference.</p>
<p>Spring Roll This is a homemade dessert. Stir-fry winter bamboo shoots or shepherd's purse with shredded meat, and then take the spring roll skins bought from the market (which are round flour pancakes), peel them off one by one, and wrap the stir-fried winter bamboo shoots and shredded meat or shepherd's purse and shredded meat inside, rolling them into small rolls like "knot-shaped bean curd sheets." When eating, they must be deep-fried in oil. Crispy and delicious, they have a special flavor.</p>
<p>Rice Dumpling This is also homemade, with several types such as jujube, salted meat, and bean paste. Jujube rice dumplings have a few jujubes added to the white rice. For salted meat rice dumplings, the fresh meat is also braised thoroughly in soy sauce, and then the washed rice is also mixed with soy sauce and wrapped together. This kind of rice dumpling must be wrapped loosely and cooked thoroughly, so that it melts in the mouth when eaten and has a delicious taste. Bean paste rice dumplings are wrapped with rice and bean paste and also require being cooked loosely and soft as the main condition.</p>
<p>Dumpling This is the most elaborate dessert of Suzhou families. Its fillings are divided into as many as seven or eight kinds, such as meat, lard bean paste, lard radish shreds, thorny paste, and so on. When making dumplings, first make all kinds of fillings, then knead the rice flour, wrap the dumplings and make them into dumplings, and then put them in a steamer to cook. When eating, some re-steam them, and some cook them in soup like Tangyuan.</p>

<p>A Word of Contribution</p>
<h3>The Education Community and the "Student National Products Year"</h3>
<p>— Xuan Wan</p>
<p>To trace the path of national products this year from the five characters "Student National Products Year," then, undeniably, in this year, the education community of our country should first shoulder the mission of promoting national products and move forward with large strides on the path of "national products education."</p>
<p>The trade deficit of China in recent years and the increasing decline of the national economy have long been known to people with insight. They know that it will not be successful unless we revitalize industry and drive out foreign goods. However, what about our education community, which is known as the advanced in knowledge? Has it made considerable efforts in the past to maintain domestic products? I remember Mr. Tai Shuangqiu once said: "Our country's schools are all agencies for selling foreign goods, and our country's teachers and students are all salesmen of foreign goods." These two sentences are aimed at the reality of our country's education community, and there is no falsehood. We know that from the buildings in the schools to the equipment and materials used, most of them are foreign goods, so that students in the education era! Some cannot produce, but have already consumed a lot of foreign goods. Assuming that the total number of students in the country is one million, then the average person consumes two yuan of imported goods per year, which is a staggering 20 million yuan. What responsibility does it have for contributing to the surge in the trade deficit and the bankruptcy of the national economy?</p>
<p>Although, remembering the past and striving for the future, if our education community can catch up quickly, the past shame can still be washed away. I dare to write down the two things that I hope everyone will earnestly implement below:</p>
<p>First, to make students abandon foreign goods and love domestic products, our education community should first set an example by doing it ourselves. We should usually wear uniforms made of domestic materials, and all conversations, actions, and objects used must be based on the principle of promoting domestic products. Then, as much as possible, use domestic products for all buildings, equipment, stationery, and appliances in the school, so that there are no foreign goods left in the entire school and it becomes a purely domestic consumer place.</p>
<p>Second, we should also use the effectiveness of education itself to create a psychology among students of loving domestic products, stimulate their self-esteem, and know that blindly worshiping foreign goods is wrong and shameful. The compilation of national products teaching materials, the promotion of national products speeches at gatherings, and the transfer of production skills and knowledge are all necessary products for the implementation of "national products education."</p>
<p>In short. Our education community is the leader of the students. In this "Student National Products Year," the responsibility lies with you, and there is no room for shirking. You should stand in front of the students and work hard for the future of domestic products!</p>
<h3>Slogans for Women's National Products</h3>
<p>— Wang Shou Qiu</p>
<p>Although I am not some Zhang Banshan or Wu Tie Zui, I dare to assert that this year's Student National Products Year will definitely not be the same as the National Products Year and Women's National Products Year. Because at the beginning of this Student National Products Year, the women's community already has considerable awareness! Now, let's take Nanjing as an example: Since the Women's Association has telegraphed the national women's community to make practical slogans for promoting domestic products, it can be seen that the women themselves have thoroughly realized this. This is truly a very good phenomenon. There are many aphorisms about the national products slogans made by the Beijing Women's Resonance Society. Now, I will copy them below, hoping that female compatriots across the country will pay attention to them.</p>
<p>(1) If women can lead their families to use domestic products, it is equivalent to leading soldiers to kill enemies for the country on the battlefield! (2) If women absolutely do not buy foreign goods, it is equivalent to soldiers recovering lost territory! (3) If you want to enjoy equal rights for men and women, you must first show equal strength. Since women cannot serve on the battlefield, they should do their best to promote domestic products. (4) The rise and fall of the country is the responsibility of every man and woman. The weapon for women to save the country is a determination to use domestic products! (5) Last year, the import of foreign goods reached 1.345 billion yuan. This year, imports should be reduced to show the strength of women's patriotism! (6) Last year, the import of food and flour ranked first, totaling 275 million yuan. The import of silk fabrics reached more than 13 million yuan. In Shanghai alone, the sale of perfumes and cosmetics reached more than 1 million yuan. This is the money spent by women. (7) Last year, more than 300 factories closed down in China, and about 330,000 workers lost their jobs. About 2 million workers and their families suffered from freezing and starvation. If women can lead their families to use domestic products, they can save the lives of 2 million people. (8) Women! Sacrifice a little beauty! It can save the country and save people; this is such a great act! (9) Using foreign goods as noble; as beautiful; is the most shameful psychology. (10) Wasting money and buying foreign goods is the most immoral behavior. From now on, let's not buy foreign goods! (11) Although domestic products are not as beautiful as imported goods, since we are born as Chinese, of course we only deserve to use Chinese goods (12) We must teach our children to never buy foreign goods. (13) We must awaken national consciousness by promoting domestic products. (14) China has 70 million displaced farmers, all as a result of the exploitation of imperialists. (15) If we want to resist the exploitation of imperialists, we can only promote domestic products</p>
<h3>Several Things to Pay Attention to in the Student National Products Year</h3>
<p>— Dan An</p>
<p>This year is the "Student National Products Year" officially designated by various groups in Shanghai. During this year, I have no other extravagant hopes or harsh demands. I will only write down a few things that we should pay attention to in the Student National Products Year for discussion and mutual encouragement with those who advocate national products.</p>
<p>(1) Hope to do more practical work and less publicity. — Now, any undertaking in our China often makes a common mistake, which is that it pays attention to publicity but not to practical work. As a result, there are no good results. This is a very regrettable thing! I very much hope that in this year's "Student National Products Year," everyone can avoid this mistake, do more practical work, and do less publicity. Then, naturally, "the name will match the reality." At least, people will not say: "The Student National Products Year" is just talking about it in the newspaper. This is the first point we should be aware of.</p>
<p>(2) More positive suggestions and less negative sanctions. — The target of the "Student National Products Year" is naturally focused on students, so this item is naturally addressed to schools. In this year's "Student National Products Year," teachers in schools bear a major responsibility. I very much hope that teachers will pay more attention to positive guidance and suggestions for guiding students to use domestic products, and use less negative sanctions. In other words: "Our country must be responsible for educating students to use domestic products, starting with leading by example in order to receive the actual effect of the suggestion. Promoting domestic products is a work of influence and should use more positive suggestions and less negative sanctions. This is the second point we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>(3) Students in universities and middle schools should be aware — According to my explanation, the degree of students using foreign goods is very small on the elementary school side, so the guidance and training for elementary school students is very easy. What we most hope is that students in universities and middle schools will wake up quickly, because in my opinion, the degree of college students and middle school students using foreign goods is much higher than that of elementary school students. In this year's "Student National Products Year," how can we make college students and middle school students a vital force in using domestic products? This is the third point we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>(4) I hope that various publications will publish more articles by students promoting domestic products. — Regarding this point, I especially hope that the national products weeklies of various newspapers and various publications responsible for promoting domestic products will publish more articles by students on promoting domestic products, because the voices from the hearts of the students are especially able to arouse the resonance and sympathy of young students. In this year's "Student National Products Year," there is also a considerable relationship and need for helping the promotion and publicity of domestic products. This is the fourth point we should pay attention to.</p>
<p>The above four items are only contributed by using the valuable space of the Shen Bao National Products Weekly. I hope everyone can discuss them more. I think: it is not without considerable relationship to the entire "Student National Products Year" domestic products movement.</p>
<h3>How Various Countries are Resisting Japanese Goods After Loving Domestic Products</h3>
<p>— Yin Ge</p>
<p>(I) Intensification of Economic Nationalism After the European War, the international economic phenomenon that deserves attention is the strengthening of economic nationalism. Advocated by Mr. Wilson, the Treaty of Versailles, which was concluded, saw the emergence of several new countries. These countries, based on the principle of national self-determination, formed independent nations. However, from an economic perspective, they lacked the necessary conditions for independent countries. In order to make up for their shortcomings, they encouraged domestic production and excluded foreign goods, thus concretizing economic nationalism.</p>
<p>The United States originally practiced protectionism, making it a nation of economic nationalism. After the Great War, this ideology was further strengthened. Everyone loved domestic products and continued to increase tariffs to block the import of foreign goods. Countries like Germany and France are old nations in Europe. The strategy for managing post-war affairs was based on economic nationalism. Although Britain is the birthplace of free trade, its economic policy has also changed in recent years. It has continued to raise tariffs on the import of foreign goods. From this perspective, this situation is quite evident among countries. Now, let's explain the situation of tariff increases in major countries around the world as follows:</p>
<p>In 1930, the United States' import value was 3 billion gold dollars. The tariff collected was 480 million gold dollars, accounting for 15.9% of the import value. However, two years later, in 1932, the import value was 1.3 billion gold dollars, while the tariff collected was 260 million gold dollars, accounting for 20% of the import value. This means that the US tax has already been raised.</p>
<p>In 1930, Britain's import value was 1.04 billion pounds. The tariff revenue was 120 million pounds, with a ratio of 11.6%. In 1932, the import value was 700 million pounds. The tariff revenue was 160 million pounds, with a ratio to the import value of 23.1%. This means that Britain's tariff has increased from 11.6% to 23.1%. The ratio of French tariff revenue to the import value was 8% in 1930 and increased to 18.3% in 1932. In 1930, Japan's import value was 1.54 billion yuan. The tariff revenue was 110 million yuan, with a ratio of 7.3%. By 1932, the import value was 1.42 billion yuan. The tariff revenue was 106 million yuan, with a ratio of 7.5%. The tariff increase was minimal.</p>
<p>The competition among countries to increase tariffs and build economic barriers against other countries is an important reason for the decline in global trade. Therefore, an economic conference was held in London last June to solve the difficulties. At this conference, the United States and the European gold standard group had conflicting opinions on the issue of exchange rate stability, which eventually led to a breakdown. The fundamental reason for the failure of this conference was the strong economic nationalism prevailing among countries, which made it impossible to ease. Since the breakdown of this conference, the budding of international coordination has been crushed again, and economic nationalism has become even more intense.</p>
<p>(II) Japan's Position on the International Trade Front From the above situation, it can be seen that excluding foreign goods and encouraging domestic production is almost a common situation in the world today. Japan's position in the international community is particularly special. There are two reasons for this. Firstly, Japan's withdrawal from the League of Nations due to the Manchurian Incident caused resentment in various countries. Secondly, the value of the Japanese Yen has fallen abnormally, making Japanese goods particularly cheap. Japan is not afraid of economic blockades by various countries after its withdrawal from the League of Nations. This is because the disadvantages of economic blockades often lie with the opposing countries, not Japan. For example, if the United States does not sell cotton to Japan, the loser will still be the United States. Therefore, economic severance is quite difficult to implement. However, slow economic pressure can be achieved on individual issues, such as economic negotiations between Britain and Japan. The decline in the Japanese Yen has a more significant impact on international pressure. The degree of resistance to it by various countries is even greater than its withdrawal from the League of Nations. For example, the economic relations between Britain and Japan, such as the Indian trade treaty issue and the increase in tariffs on cotton cloth, all stem from this.</p>
<h3>The Path to Survival for Domestic Goods</h3>
<p>— Da Bu</p>
<p>Someone asked: "Why haven't there been significant achievements in the two years of promoting domestic goods?" This question made me think about the path to survival for domestic goods.</p>
<p>Where is the path to survival for domestic goods? (1) In publicity: In recent years, the establishment of domestic goods companies everywhere has led to considerable sales, which should be the effect of publicity; (2) In imitation: Anyone who has been to a domestic goods company will naturally see a lot of domestic goods, and the achievements in imitation can be described as outstanding; (3) In cultivating talents for researching domestic goods raw materials, this work should be assigned to research institutes in the highest institutions or organizations like scientific societies; For example, our tung oil is originally a large export commodity. If foreign countries plant tung trees now, the future harvest will be our loss. Relying on foreign goods as raw materials is not a long-term plan; (4) In establishing large-scale factories; For example, many highways have been built in various provinces, and the means of transportation rely entirely on foreign goods, which is not a good solution. We should also have a car factory like the Russian Stalin Factory, manufacturing completely domestic cars. Similarly, there should also be large-scale aircraft factories, manufacturing completely domestic aircraft; This great work should be founded by the government or jointly by officials and businessmen; (5) In invention: New inventions can not only wash away our Chinese people's shame of not being able to create miracles, but also have a good opportunity to promote sales abroad. Although this item is listed last, it is the most important.</p>
<p>Looking at it this way, I dare to answer the initial question; The failure in the past two years is because only the first two points mentioned above have been done, and the rest have not been achieved. Even if the last item has factual evidence, those inventors may be trapped by financial resources, so we have not yet seen their harvest, which is really a pity!</p>
<p>News</p>
<h3>Doctor Brand Soap Sells Well</h3>
<p>Doctor Brand Soap is produced by Tianjin Zhongchang Soap Factory. The manager of the factory, Mr. Shi Dongchu, once studied in Europe and has a wealth of experience. Considering that soap is a daily necessity, and the climate in South China is hot and humid, bathing and washing require even more soap than elsewhere. If our compatriots all use imported products, the loss of interests will be alarming. Therefore, he carefully researched and used purely domestic raw materials to mechanically produce various soaps. Up to now, it has been 20 years, and after government investigation and examination by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, it has been confirmed as a purely complete and excellent domestic product, and a certificate of protection has been specially issued. The soaps produced by the factory, totaling 70 or 80 kinds, are all of excellent quality, pure and fragrant, and have special effects on protecting health. In the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the factory established business offices on the second floor of Jiufu Company at No. 5 Ma Road in the Shanghai British Concession, and in Changfeng Bank on Haopan Street in Guangzhou to expand sales and facilitate procurement.</p>
<h3>Multi-filament Light Bulb - A New Invention by Mr. Qiu Boan, a Young Chinese Man</h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>During this year of promoting domestic goods, the new invention of multi-filament light bulbs by young Mr. Qiu Boan is a truly gratifying event! The multi-filament light bulb has been on the market for several months, and users in this and other cities have consistently praised it. Therefore, the business is becoming increasingly prosperous, and the supply cannot meet the demand. It is recalled that at the opening of the distribution office on Daxin Street, someone presented the inscription "The Light of Domestic Goods". Looking at it today, it is truly not an empty reputation.</p>
<p>The biggest feature of the multi-filament light bulb is its economy. Its manufacturing combines three or two filaments of different wattage into one, which can be activated in sequence. It is equipped with a mechanism that can be used to activate any number of filaments at will, hence the name "multi-filament." Even if one filament breaks, the other filaments remain intact and can still be used. If there are three filaments, one bulb is equivalent to three bulbs; if there are two filaments, it is equivalent to two bulbs. The bulb will only be discarded when all three or two filaments are broken. However, the second feature of the multi-filament light bulb is its durability. The filaments do not break easily; other bulbs are discarded first. Moreover, the multi-filament light bulb is not afraid of severe vibrations.</p>
<p>The first batch of products still had a flaw, which was that before installing the bulb, the switch had to be turned off before it could be activated, which was a bit of a hassle. After the second batch, research and improvements have been made, and it is no longer necessary to turn off the switch first, which is more convenient for users. Therefore, the increasing prosperity of its business is a matter of expectation, not accidental.</p>
<p>Short Story</p>
<h3>A Year's Effort (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Ye Qibai</p>
<p>(I) The Beginning of Awakening</p>
<p>I went back to my village for three days and happily spent the Lunar New Year at home; now I'm back at school again, time really flies! My mother's loving face seems to be still in front of my eyes.</p>
<p>Imagining that during the holidays, many classmates went home; how lonely this school and this dormitory must have been! But now it has returned to the same liveliness and the same joy as in the past.</p>
<p>My classmate Tao and I were sitting at the desk in the bedroom, he was writing his diary, and I was writing an unfinished manuscript.</p>
<p>"Ji Ge, Ji Ge," suddenly, there was the sound of leather shoes walking, getting closer and closer. From the rhythm of this shoe sound, we could tell that it was our good friend He coming.</p>
<p>"Ah! It's probably Lao He coming." I put down my pen, took the thermos, and poured hot water to drink; I said this to Lao Tao.</p>
<p>Lao Tao didn't speak, just nodded to me; and Lao He had already walked into the room.</p>
<p>A very spirited young man in a suit; curly hair, face so fair and lovely; snow-white scarf, inlaid in the collar of the black coat, the black and white, set off the harmonious brightness; the suit pants, straight, covered the back of the leather shoes, and revealed the shiny pointed leather shoe toes.</p>
<p>"Oh! Lao He! What did you buy? In that paper bag," I said.</p>
<p>"Isn't it food?" Tao also asked.</p>
<p>He opened the paper bag with a smile. Several exquisite cosmetics were revealed in the green oily wrapping paper. What Pond's Cold Cream, what Si Dan Kang, what ×××'s hair styling gel, ............ all imported cosmetics.</p>
<p>"Lao He! Where did you buy these things?" I asked.</p>
<p>"Oh! I watched a play with Miss Li at the Paris Theater and bought them on Avenue Joffre: I only bought a little bit myself, and bought a lot for Miss Li! Oh! The foreign girls in that department store are really beautiful! The attitude is so kind to hand the things to me, and send us out." He said this very proudly.</p>
<p>"But, you have to know, what kind of stuff is this?" Tao pulled and asked.</p>
<p>"Of course it's imported goods!" He said arrogantly.</p>
<p>"Then, you should know that this year is Student Domestic Goods Year! Why do you still buy foreign goods; and, it's consumable foreign goods?" Tao asked again.</p>
<p>"Oh! I know that. But, you have to forgive me, in front of a girlfriend, if I don't do this, it would be a stingy and shameful thing!" He replied.</p>
<p>"Ha! You're wrong, do you think buying these imported cosmetics will enhance your love; and going to the domestic goods company to buy domestic cosmetics will diminish your love? I don't think so, and if there are domestic goods to buy, buying them as gifts is a glorious and happy thing!" Tao said a lot again.</p>
<p>He nodded, silently, expressing endless guilt, and had nothing more to argue. And I just sat in silence; thinking, He is awake. So, I broke the temporary silence and said: (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Trivial Talks on Historical Essays (I)</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Literature and history are twin sisters in China. European and Western academics have always been included in philosophy; in China, all academics originate from history. Ancient and modern literati often steal tricks from the Records of the Grand Historian and the Book of Han. Gui Youguang, the ancestor of the Tongcheng School, was an ancient essayist who read the Records of the Grand Historian with a five-colored pen; Zhang Shizhai also wrote a book like "Wen Shi Tong Yi" that connected literature and history. Not only ancient essayists, but also pure literary writers are like this: Sima Qian's Biography of Xiang Yu vividly describes the siege of Gaixia. Tang and Song poets used this theme to compose epic poems, and playwrights used this theme to create dramas. Now there is still Mei Lanfang playing "Farewell My Concubine", which is quite popular. Historical figures such as Zhu Maichen, Wang Zhaojun, and Yang Guifei are also written in this way and that way, with various ideologies changing with the times. Someone discussed the issue of literary property in previous years; If we want to say that China has any precious literary heritage, I think it is definitely not ancient essays or parallel prose; history is one of the valuable heritages.</p>
<p>Since the May Fourth Movement, biographical literature has declined, and chapter novels with historical stories as themes have also declined. The new novels influenced by European and American literature are completely different from chapter novels in terms of skills and consciousness; Some people have also put new coats on historical figures, such as Guo Moruo's "Three Rebellious Women" and Wang Duqing's "Yang Guifei", which can only be said to be small ripples in the literary craze and are not noticed by the general public. Mao Dun also wrote several short historical novels such as "Dazexiang" and "Shijie" after the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, but the impact was not significant; Until now, only Liu Shengdan's excavation is a purely historical collection. Recently, with the development of essays, some people have paid attention to the development of historical essays. Last month, a female art group sent someone to see me and said that there are three emerging essay styles: humorous essays, scientific essays, and historical essays, with historical essays being the most noticed by them. This may be a sign that biographical literature and historical novels are making a comeback.</p>
<p>I started writing historical essays inspired by the Japanese Ryunosuke Akutagawa. The three pieces of Akutagawa Ryunosuke's essays read in Xie Liuyi's translation of Japanese essay selections all used Chinese historical events: 1. "The Device of a Hero" was written using the stories of Xiang Yu Benji Lu Ma Dong; 2. "Weisheng's Letter" was written using the story of Weisheng in the Records of the Grand Historian; 3. "Yellow Millet Dream" was written using the story of Lusheng in the Tang Dynasty legend. Once decorated, ancient stories appear in the current era with a very new posture, and I feel a very strong interest. For example, at the end of "Yellow Millet Dream", it says: "Xu Sheng listened intently to Lu Weng's words, and when he asked his opponent carefully, he raised his youthful face and said with a glint in his eyes: 'Because this is a dream, I still want to live, like the awakening of that dream, this dream will come when it awakens! When that time comes, I still want to live a true life, don't you think so?'" This modern spirit is as bright as the sun, making me very happy. Following his candle light, reading the history books I have read in the past, new meanings flash everywhere. Three years ago, I started writing this kind of essay.</p>
<h3>Small Scene of Huaiyuan</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>For the sake of life, I traveled far from Jiangnan to Huaiyuan.</p>
<p>Huaiyuan is a small county town in northern Anhui. It is about twenty-five miles upstream from Bengbu. If Huaiyuan is a county town, it really doesn't look like one; If you compare it with Kunshan, Suzhou in Jiangnan, this place only has the style of a town.</p>
<p>The streets are all paved with uneven mountain stones. It is even more difficult to walk in the rain. There is no prosperous market, nor any large shops with decent scale; At night, there are no street lights, nor any night markets; After ten o'clock, I sit quietly in the room, listening to the watchman beating the big bronze gong on the dark streets. From the loud sound of the gong, you can hear the desolation of this county town.</p>
<p>Under the scene of such a gray street scene, after you run through it once, you won't want to walk it a second time.</p>
<p>Just take a casual look at the street to see the poverty of this place. In front of the board tables at the door of some very small restaurants, one or two sallow-faced men are sitting there chewing a piece of dark wheat cake with relish. Such a life is really fatal for southerners.</p>
<p>However, most of the people here live on this stuff. Those who eat rice are a minority and a minority of the upper class, but it is only the crudest steamed rice mixed with millet.</p>
<p>This small city is surrounded by mountains on three sides. Although there is no beautiful scenery, the natural scenery is enough to watch. At sunset, the sun sets from the waist of the mountain, and the red light reflects the snow-covered mountain tops; Watching a crow in the evening, croaking and flapping its dark wings and flying back. At this time, a homesickness like light clouds comes to touch your heart.</p>
<p>Burning a cigarette, sitting silently by the window, listening to the vulgar and annoying gongs and drums of the street performers; Carefully taste the life and scenery of this place, and think like an idiot, the old China is so desolate and pitiful everywhere!</p>
<p>February 13, 1935, at Huaizhong, Huaiyuan</p>
<h3>Science and Literature</h3>
<p>— Bo Han</p>
<p>Combining literature and science does not seem to be a recent topic. Since the great development of natural science in the nineteenth century, naturalism in literature has flourished greatly. Those naturalist writers undoubtedly tried their best to use the achievements of science in literature. Now, in our literary world, we hear the call to combine science and literature again. Is it to relive the old dreams of the nineteenth century? I think it's not that simple.</p>
<p>After reading the content of the natural science essays mentioned on Free Talk a few days ago, and talking about the penetration of natural science and literature, I thought that there are two tendencies in this. For example, the article "On the Penetration of Natural Science and Literature" is based on the standpoint of emphasizing literature, and its intention is to apply scientific methods to literature, but the article "The Content of Natural Science Essays" emphasizes the content of science. Originally, the newly emerging scientific essay is a kind of thing that uses literary brushstrokes to talk about science, and the focus is on science.</p>
<p>The rise of scientific essays like this is undoubtedly a new trend. Because of this, we can say that today's mention of science and literature getting married is not to relive the old dreams of the nineteenth century.</p>
<p>But according to the principle that content determines form, then, taking natural scientific facts as content, naturally, it is necessary to adopt that kind of cumbersome and dry form in order to meticulously and economically record the products of human reason without omission. This is the origin of general scientific writing. But literary writing is a concrete expression of human life, human thoughts, and emotions. Its content is living people and the logical development of their behavior. Therefore, it has another form, so moving and thought-provoking. Now, we want to express the content of science in the form of literature. Isn't it a difficult task to "climb a tree to catch a fish"?</p>
<p>What can be expressed in the form of literature is only the scientific ideas, theories and work. I think that the activities of people should still be the center, and science should be integrated. The so-called scientific ideas are performing and implying in the activities of various characters, and scientific work is of course not a rigid report of work results, but a lively description of the work process. The selection of content should not be arbitrarily dividing scientific records into fragments and using them to fill the number, but connecting important scientific ideas with the real society and expressing them in a literary way.</p>
<h3>Cattle and Horse Row</h3>
<p>— Xicun</p>
<p>There is a road in Jilin called -- Cattle and Horse Row.</p>
<p>Please think about this name. Interesting, isn't it?</p>
<p>Of course, you think that there are mostly "cattle" and "horses" on the row, but you will soon regret that you are thinking wrong; How can a street have mostly "cattle" and "horses" walking and fewer humans? A street is always opened for the convenience of traffic, and it is definitely not built for the sake of walking cattle and horses. So, you guess again, thinking: Maybe it is a place to comment on the market conditions of cattle and horses and talk about buying and selling? In other words, should there be a "cattle and horse market" attached? Yes, my opinion is exactly the same as yours. However, it must be said that although we guess the same and it is very reasonable, in reality, the situation of Cattle and Horse Row is completely different. Even if this street was originally named as we guessed, however, in recent years, there has been no such thing.</p>
<p>"So, what kind of street is Cattle and Horse Row?"</p>
<p>You can't help but ask me this way. Yes, I should explain it to you, so as not to make you shake your head at this interesting name.</p>
<p>Friends, haven't you been to the City God Temple in Shanghai? Okay, this saves me a lot of trouble in words. Let me tell you, the situation of Cattle and Horse Row in Jilin is the same as the area near the City God Temple in Shanghai. Cattle and horses are naturally not lacking, but they do not become a (market), but run to do the work of pulling carts and transporting goods. So, let me tell you, "Cattle and Horse" Row is exactly where "people" walk. It's quite interesting to compare people to cattle and horses. In fact, to be honest, why can't people "be compared to" cattle and horses? No, why aren't people "are" cattle and horses? Everyone, running around every day, the situation is the same as the running of cattle and horses.</p>
<p>Cattle and Horse Row is a very wide street. The City God Temple is at the southwest end, but the temple is only for people to burn incense and worship. As for the rest of the shops, large and small, they are not in the temple. Going out of the City God Temple and turning north along the street, look: blacksmith shops, flames and dust swirling around, and small vendors selling small toys along the street. Then there are pawnshops, shoe shops, and food shops. Further on, there is a labor market, where you will see groups of poor people waiting together for employers to come. They don't look like humans, but like a pile of goods for people to choose from. The vegetable building is built in the middle of the street, and this is where expensive vegetables are sold. In winter, you can buy cucumbers and eggplants, as long as you are willing to spend more money. Not far behind, another area is created, like a square garden, which is called the "Antique Market". There are indeed some antiques, but I don't know the goods and can't say much about the names, but in this "Antique Market", the second-hand clothes sellers shouted while stomping their feet. But the shouting sounds they shout are rhythmic songs. Listen, I'll write you a set of short songs:</p>
<p>"This good fur coat</p>
<p>Five thousand nine hundred and thirty diaos,</p>
<p>It's good to wear,</p>
<p>The hair won't fall out for five or six years."</p>
<p>Continuing north, to the south of the north city wall, there is the big vegetable market, which is really lively in the morning. There are many grain stores and hotels, all of which are doing business in winter. In winter, the vehicles and horses of the villages that come to the city to sell grain all have to live in these inns.</p>
<p>A Cattle and Horse Row street is busy all day long. The people and horses coming and going are running around together. Shouting, the sound of restaurants calling seats and knocking spoons, the sound of iron tools banging, the sound of street performers striking gongs, the sound of female drummers shouting and singing... are mixed together and released in all directions, releasing priceless miscellaneous music.</p>
<p>In Cattle and Horse Row, you can't see fashionable women, you can't find fashionable women, you can't find elegant scholars who taste tea and chat. The characters who come and go are just living a little better than cattle and horses. The name Cattle and Horse Row is still in use, please think about it, isn't this name also not unsuitable?</p>
<h3>Robbery</h3>
<p>— Ding Lang</p>
<p>Having suffered someone's oversight, scattered yellow soybeans are all over the ground; the cold wind turns up hunched and tattered clothes, five or six children, more than ten hands busy on the ground.</p>
<p>A car sped past, emitting a cloud of grinding, sandy green smoke; embracing the dust, they can't fill their own bags, only regretting why they didn't break a few more burlap sacks? No one cares about this, each goes his own way. Casting a white eye, expressing indifference!</p>
<p>Heaven only gave two hands, otherwise they could scoop it all up; everyone jostles, unable to compete with the elderly.</p>
<h3>Dusk (3)</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>Finally, they walked onto Xinsheng Road. They turned right. A gust of wind blew at the corner. The short one hastily straightened his clothes, casually buttoning a button, pulling the long shirt down even further, shortening his legs by another inch. The tall one took two strides, putting the short one behind him.</p>
<p>Xinsheng Road still insists on maintaining its dignity, putting on the airs of a major metropolis in central China. The electric lights are blindingly bright. Outside each shop, various dazzling red and green colors—either advertising posters or sample fabrics—are used to decorate their aging appearance. But every few shops, there is always a shop with its door half-closed, or completely sealed with a white "for rent" sign, puncturing the vanity of this Xinsheng Road that so desperately wants to save face.</p>
<p>However, Xinsheng Road is, after all, glorious, and is, after all, lively. The people on the sidewalks are jostling each other. As soon as the sound of leather shoes passes by, a large group of "road inspectors" of all ages, looking emaciated, surround it. At the same time, cries of "Master! Young master! Sir!" also chase after the "clip-clop, clip-clop" of the leather shoes.</p>
<p>The tall one's leather shoes sounded loudly on Xinsheng Road. The road inspectors followed him as usual. All the more separating the short one behind, even though the short one quickened his short legs, he could only see a particularly prominent black head floating on the "sea of heads."</p>
<p>"Damn!" The black head suddenly stopped floating. He cursed. The short one, then, quickened his steps, immediately charged into the crowd, and rejoined the tall one, becoming a matching pair.</p>
<p>"Not easy!" he said, "So walking the whole country is impossible. At this rate, it will take ten years to walk half of Xinsheng Road!"</p>
<p>"Damn! It's best to—" The tall one's mouth and leather shoes made sounds at the same time, sounding loud and rhythmic. "Shoot them one by one! Then the world will be at peace. This bunch of Chinese! Chinese! When I was in Japan—"</p>
<p>"Hey! Hey! Move!" Immediately, a voice of expulsion came from across the street. Look, a dark brown policeman is walking towards them. He is dispersing the road inspectors! "Still not moving! You street ghosts! Hey! Hey!..."</p>
<p>"Clip-clop! Clip-clop! Clip-clop!" Also the sound of leather shoes, majestic and powerful! Immediately, he drove the wandering souls into the alleys in groups of three or four: some even flew to the garbage cans at the entrances of the alleys like flies chasing after a foul smell, grabbing, patting, searching for discarded rice grains and bones.</p>
<p>"After all—" The tall one patted the short one on the shoulder. "China isn't going to perish after all! There are still a few people maintaining order. When I was in Japan!"</p>
<p>"Hmm!" This time, the short one had nothing to say. He seemed to feel some sadness. The policeman and his partner both wore leather shoes. They walked with energy and authority. Only he wore rubber shoes! Walking along, it sounded like an old toothless woman muttering a curse.</p>
<p>"However—" But another thought crossed his mind. "Walking is lighter with these rubber shoes! Although my wallet is also in bad shape. But—"</p>
<p>"But which way should we turn now!" The tall one stopped at the entrance of Xinsheng Road.</p>

<p>Talking Points</p>
<h3>The German Sex Spy Case</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>Last month, a sex spy case occurred in Japan, in which many noble women were in love with a foreign military officer, and they did not hesitate to search for information and secretly contribute it to him. As a result, one of the women reported to the authorities because her request was not fulfilled, and the case was broken. Unexpectedly, a similar case has recently occurred in Germany. It is romantic and extremely sensational, like material from a novel. The protagonist is Mrs. Von Bülow, and Mrs. Nazena has been sentenced to death. It is truly a case of like minds think alike.</p>
<p>It is said that the truth of the case is that Baroness von Bülow met a Polish military officer who loved gambling and riding, and was beautiful and charming. The Baroness fell in love with him and could not extricate herself, and was willing to run around and find military secrets for him. What was particularly vicious was that the Baroness made many women at social events, indulged in drinking, and introduced them to young men. The women with weak will would have illicit affairs with them, and the Baroness would secretly take their photos and show them to their daughters. Thus, for the sake of their faces, the women had no choice but to obey her orders. Her use of schemes was unparalleled.</p>
<p>The art of war says that if you know yourself and your enemy, you will win every battle. If you want to know your enemy, you cannot do without spies. In the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods of our country, diplomacy was rampant, the strong annexed the weak, so the art of espionage was quite researched. In recent years, the world has become interconnected, and the law of the jungle prevails, which is the same as in the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, so the art of espionage also has an unfathomable aspect. Sun Tzu's "The Use of Spies" says that there are five types of spies: native spies, inside spies, double spies, expendable spies, and living spies. Inside spies are those who are employed from among the enemy's officials. Therefore, the German sex spy case is also a type of inside spy. Because female spies had not yet been invented at that time, Sun Tzu did not explain it, but he said that one cannot obtain the truth of espionage without subtlety. One must be divine and adaptable, which depends on human effort.</p>
<p>In recent years, many countries have used women as spies, firstly, because women's actions rarely involve politics, so people do not pay much attention to them. Secondly, beautiful women are easily infatuated by men with sexual desires, and domestic secrets are often easily exposed unconsciously. Nowadays, countries are opening up new frontiers and using handsome men as spies, so that women with sexual desires are infatuated with military uniforms and leather boots, and obey their lovers' commands. This method of espionage is truly full of wonders.</p>
<p>Baroness von Bülow and Mrs. Nazena, because they were infatuated with a Polish military officer, did not hesitate to secretly leak the German plan to invade Poland. The seriousness of their crimes is self-evident, and being sentenced to death is their just desert. However, Germany used an axe to behead the two women, instead of shooting or electrocuting them, which is not the behavior of a civilized country. Therefore, the British newspaper criticized it as a "revival of medieval barbaric behavior," which cannot be said to be an excessive criticism.</p>
<h3>×× Chronicle</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>×× is a native of Jiangbei. He is a university professor and has a considerable status in society; he is indeed "my friend," and a very good one at that, which is truly fortunate. Because we are very good friends, I have explained to him several times that I want to give him a quick sketch and submit it to the newspaper. At first, he flatly denied it, but later he couldn't resist me and reluctantly agreed, but he said, "Friend, no matter what, don't announce my name!" This is the origin of the code name ××.</p>
<p>Just being a university professor is not so special. ×× has a special quality. Just focusing on his daily life, describing it would be a very long article. There is too much material. Here, I can only "extract the essence and select the finest" and briefly go through it.</p>
<p>His daily life is full of romance, but he is not a researcher of literature, but an educational mentor. His living room is disorganized beyond description. From the beginning of the semester to the vacation, the two greasy and pungent cotton quilts on the bed are never folded. Books and magazines are piled all over the bed, no, he simply tramples on the books. There are also books on the table, books on the floor, and of course even more in the corners. Books, very messy books, are scattered all over the room. In addition, there are countless cigarette butts. Speaking of cigarettes, they really seem to be his life. He has two deep ashtrays, one placed on the desk and the other placed next to his pillow. When reading and writing, he smokes non-stop, and he always smokes a few cigarettes before going to bed. He often says that he can eat less rice, but he must smoke more cigarettes. If you talk to him for less than a quarter of an hour, he will smoke at least three cigarettes in a row.</p>
<p>However, it is indeed strange that his work and rest are very regular. He goes to bed every night at eight o'clock (at the latest nine o'clock) and gets up before six o'clock in the morning, which is a devout follower of the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>As for talking about things outside of his daily life, that is truly a waste of words.</p>
<p>He often says: "Our Jiangbei dialect, although it doesn't sound very good, is easy to learn. But the Shanghai dialect is really not easy to learn. I have been in 'this place' for five whole years, and I only know the two words 'fire speed, fire speed.' These two words are very useful when taking a car to exchange copper coins or buying things in a store. As soon as I say them, people know that I am not a country bumpkin, and I get a lot of advantages."</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>He wore his straw hat until late autumn before it disappeared. One day, he suddenly changed to a new felt hat, but the felt hat was extremely clumsy. Looking at it, it was at most a one-dollar item. I was very surprised and questioned him: "Mr. ××, how can a university professor wear such a cheap felt hat?" This triggered his chatter, and he said so eloquently: "I have also worn wool hats that cost five or six yuan, and I have also worn felt hats that cost more than ten yuan, but they were always robbed. How were they robbed? I was sitting in a rickshaw, and the rickshaw puller ran forward quickly. I was careless, and the hat on my head was grabbed and taken away. I jumped out of the car to chase, but they were gone like a crane in the yellow sky. So now I only buy felt hats that cost one yuan, which is much more reassuring. I can wear one for two years without losing it, and it's even more cost-effective."</p>
<p>I have never seen his virtuous wife. According to his own confession, she is a typical rural yellow-faced woman, but he loves her very much. He writes her at least three letters a week, and they are written in the most sweet way. Once, I walked quietly into his room and stood behind him. He was writing a love letter to his wife. The opening sentences were: "×: It has been raining these days in this place, and it has been raining heavily, so my heart is troubled. I miss you all the time!..."</p>
<p>Therefore, I often talk to him about women, which makes him very happy. When we talk about it, he is simply endless. When he is happy, he always says "ha ha, ha ha, incredibly". But he also tries his best to express his respect for women. He says that he has never flirted with a second woman except for his own wife. During the January 28th Incident, he and a female friend were trapped in a warehouse together. That woman simply acted wildly towards him, but he held back and did not do anything. He only said that when he was working in a ×× organization, a female colleague asked him for an abortion prescription, and he only flirted with her a few times, but it was not important.</p>
<p>××'s interesting stories are really too many to tell, so let's stop here!</p>
<h3>Listening to the Wind</h3>
<p>— Jing Jia</p>
<p>Recently, I have developed a hobby of listening to the wind, which is formed by the environment. For the past few years, I have lived in the countryside by the sea. There are no high mountains in the vast fields, so the sea breeze can sing freely around my house. Morning, noon, dusk, late at night, it is always playing on my eardrums. So, I have developed a hobby of listening to the wind—in fact, even if I don't want to listen, I have to listen.</p>
<p>I feel that the music of the wind is extremely magnificent. Perhaps the shouts of killing on the battlefield are no more than that? Sometimes I am tired, so I light a cigarette and lean on the window frame, putting my ears on the glass window. Then I can be happy for a while, and even sad or annoying things will be forgotten. The sound of the wind gives me a lot of comfort.</p>
<p>Since I have this hobby, I hope that the music of the wind will not be interrupted. I hope for the arrival of the wind as eagerly as I hope for food.</p>
<p>However, one day I finally discovered my own selfishness. I saw a poor farmer in his fifties or sixties walking slowly on the road. His hands were in his sleeves, his head was shrunk, and the roaring wind blew off the broken strips hanging on his tattered clothes. Immediately, I knew that he was being bullied by the wind, while I was the one who was enjoying the wind! I was indeed sinful. I thought that the wind was not for me to enjoy. The rich enjoy the snow, and the beggars freeze to death, it's all the same thing. I am not rich, I should not forget others!</p>
<p>So I cut off my hobby of listening to the wind.</p>
<h3>Taoye Ferry</h3>
<p>— Hou Hu</p>
<p>Taoye Ferry will never be erased from the memory of my life. It was four years ago, on a silent moonlit night in late autumn, I came out from a small wine shop after drinking alone. Probably because of my fondness for it! Although the wine filled my head, I still stumbled along the road to the Taoye Ferry, the "land of Six Dynasties gold dust." The sky was covered with glittering stars, and the Wende Bridge across the Qinhuai River, and the willows swaying on both banks of the river, seemed to accompany my lonely heart, but I didn't see a single Taoye leaf. I timidly held onto the railing and looked down at the flowing water of the Qinhuai River. I thought that because the houses on both sides were high and dense, the river seemed more solemn and profound than our city river. The black water of the river reflected the bright moonlight, making it even more mysterious. The windows of the river houses on both sides were closed quietly, and there was probably a plank railing outside the windows, fully showing the flavor of the water towns of Jiangnan. I looked far away at the mountain peaks of Zhongshan covered with moonlight, and further imagined the scenery of the Qinhuai River flowing into the countryside ten miles away, and I couldn't help but recite the ancient poem "To this day, only Jiangshan is green, Qin is only blue," a poem lamenting the past. Thinking of the prosperous scene of the Qinhuai River in "The Scholars," with "ten miles of pearl curtains, singing and painted boats," compared to the quiet houses in front of me, the cool moonlight, and the dark river, how could I not be filled with desolate and sentimental thoughts!</p>
<p>Taking advantage of the moonlight, I walked across the bridge and went to the pile of low bungalows. The streets were narrow and medieval, and the double doors of the houses on both sides were mostly nailed with animal hinges and copper rings, and pasted with red paper couplets, fully showing the colors of the northern city—even though it was still in Jiangnan—but the loveliness and memorableness of this ancient city lies in these ordinary and simple places! I walked around in circles, humming ancient famous poems, trying to grasp the loveliness of this scenic spot from my marrow, and also wanted to find a few local elders to ask about the rise and fall of this ferry, but the doors of the houses were closed quietly, and the owls on the trees made strange cries that made people's hair stand on end, as if saying that it was late at night. Walking back along the river, turning my head every step of the way. On the way, I passed a narrow and winding alley, with a sign that said "Ancient Fishing Alley." It turned out that this was the ancient alley of the capital's boundless spring scenery. Since ancient times, this has been a place of orioles and flowers. Its mystery is no less than that of the North Sichuan Road, Shanghai's "Mystery Street." It contains infinite romantic stories from ancient times to the present, but the charm of this place is ancient, lush, elegant, and contained in the bones, which is completely different from the naked scene of North Sichuan Road. I can only wait for a chance in the future to come back to this ancient alley to see the peach blossoms and faces!</p>
<h3>The Only Way Out for Rural Women</h3>
<p>— A Fool's Words</p>
<h3>Morning</h3>
<p>— Feng</p>
<p>It has almost become my habit that even if I sleep late, I will always wake up when the east is slightly bright. In a corner like the one I live in, it is really quiet enough; if you want to sleep, you can sleep quietly in the cool air of the morning, but you can't; every day when the crows fly over the roof, I will always wake up, and I have finally breathed enough of the morning air. I forgot who said that people who live in the city don't have mornings, and people who can't see the morning are pitiful; so, waking up early is very happy.</p>
<p>I am not from the city. Country people get up early, and I am also quite fond of the country morning, and I like to be busy in the morning: especially after many years of city life, I especially love the country morning. In the countryside, I can't bear to sleep in the morning. When I hear the rooster crowing for the third time, like a child who wants to get up to wear new clothes for the New Year, I will get up, and sometimes I will walk around in the lower crescent moon, attracting the dogs in the village to bark: I have tasted the taste of "the bright moon surrounds the quiet room" in the morning. In fact, not only is the room quiet, but everything is very quiet, there is movement in the quiet, there is vitality: oh, it is so full of life, whose door is open, in the faint light, you can hear people talking, but you can't see people; these are all very fond of me, but there are no them in the city, the city morning seems to have not attracted anyone's attention, even the people in the city don't have a morning.</p>
<p>Morning seems to be destined for me. After I became a city dweller, I still saw a lot of mornings in the city.</p>
<p>I like the sound of pushcarts or large carts rolling over the streets in the morning. Rumble. Rumble, rumble, very nice to hear, that sound will drive away all evil thoughts from people, will arouse the courage of lazy people, and move forward in that advancing sound. It's really like a piece of music that shows the tide attacking the rocks, a layer of waves rushes up, retreats, quiets down, and moves away; the second layer rushes up again, and it's the same way, tick-tick-tick, the tone goes from high to low, and moves away again. Every morning, my alley always rings like that, and when the sun smears the treetops, that sound disappears. After this, the sound of the almond tea pot lid rings, and it is transmitted from the alley. In the cool air of the morning, you can see the water vapor rising from afar, and a group of people are drinking so busily around the tea pot; after finishing, they put down their bowls, and the almond tea is picked to another place, and the alley begins to quiet down. The quiet after a rush often makes me feel lonely. Open the curtains and look at the morning sun, the gray roof tiles, even in the morning air, the color is still so gray; the only thing that can comfort me is the sparrows bathing and leaping on the neighbor's withered locust tree. The morning in the city is over like this, and when the hooligans carrying birdcages sing strange tunes in the alley, in the countryside, the sun can already warm your back.</p>
<p>However, it is still unfortunate that when I knew that getting up early was a blessing, I was already a city dweller. In the countryside, getting up early is a habit, but that is a blessing, that must be what city people say. Country people only know how to get up early, but they don't know that getting up early is a blessing; city people can say that getting up early is a blessing, but in reality they don't have a morning. These are two groups of people, and their lives may be distinguished in this place. I am a countryman in the city, I know this.</p>

<h3>Mary Pickford on the Secrets of Movie Star Success (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Zhu Tong</p>
<p>Mary Pickford also said that one should not take a setback too seriously. A loss may turn out to be a blessing in disguise. She said: "Once, we wanted to hire Charles Farrell to co-star with me in a film. But later we didn't use him and replaced him with someone else. Charles was inevitably disappointed and sad. I called him in and told him that we didn't use him not because he couldn't act, but because another person's style was more suitable. A week later, Fox offered him to co-star with Janet Gaynor in "Seventh Heaven". He became famous overnight in "Seventh Heaven". If we had used him beforehand, the results might not have been as impressive as "Seventh Heaven".</p>
<p>"Don't go out socializing too often. Your time is extremely precious, so avoid all unnecessary social engagements as much as possible. Always prioritize your career. If you have free time, you should use it to prepare yourself and develop your talents in all aspects, even in the smallest areas. French or Italian can improve your diction and give you a wider range in your speech. I am still learning French myself. I will also learn some Italian soon.</p>
<p>"Get at least eight hours of sleep every day. It is best to sleep eight and a half hours every day. Try to make yourself feel refreshed in the morning so that your healthy beauty is reflected in your face. You should treat the time after 10 p.m. every night as belonging to your career if you haven't gotten a job, or as belonging to the company if you already have a job. This way, you won't waste that precious sleep time.</p>
<p>"While it is important to maintain strict self-discipline, you must not be too harsh on yourself. Personal enjoyment, within a reasonable range, is indispensable. You should treat yourself as you would treat your little sister. You should often talk to yourself and point out all your mistakes. You can also apologize to yourself if you have done something wrong and promise not to do it again. You may make the same mistake a second time, but never make the same mistake three times in a row. If you keep making mistakes one after another, then you are really incorrigibly foolish. No one is perfect. Moreover, without mistakes, there is no progress. One is never too old to learn. I always gain new experiences and new insights every day. But there are many things that you don't need to experience yourself, you can learn from others.</p>
<p>"Avoid all disreputable publicity. The status of stars does not come from disreputable publicity. Even when you are humble and unknown, you must never use disreputable publicity to get people to hear your name. Otherwise, she will eventually regret it. Many famous women in Hollywood share my view on this point.</p>
<p>"While you are in Hollywood, don't let your thinking become outdated. You should have a good understanding of art, literature, politics, etc. Many people have lived in Hollywood for too long, and their thoughts, conversations, and actions are all limited by their work, resulting in them becoming mechanical figures whose words are dull and tasteless. Good hobbies are also essential for everyone. They can give you new interests and refresh your mind after hard work. These hobbies should ideally be useful to you in the future. For example, after you leave the screen, you can turn the hobbies you are familiar with into your profession, such as calligraphy, painting, music, etc.</p>
<p>"When your career gradually shows promise, you must not assume that your position is stable, and you must not indulge in pleasure. You should work as hard as you did when you first arrived in Hollywood. You must always remember that the success and rewards you have achieved are temporary and fleeting. Don't spend all your income. You should save part of it as a precaution for the future. If your weekly income is twenty-five dollars, you should save five dollars. Although this amount is not large, it can help you develop a habit of thrift and constantly generate a warning force in your mind, so that you will not forget to continue to work hard."</p>
<p>What Mary Pickford said above is, of course, for young American women who want to enter the film industry. But the words contained therein are all truths. All our young men and women who want to enter the film industry should also read them carefully, so that they can also know some of the necessary conditions for entering the film industry and the mistakes that should be avoided. (The End)</p>
<p>Movie Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "One Hour Late"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>One Hour Late — Da Guangming —</p>
<p>As a comedy, "One Hour Late" constructs a relatively complex story in twelve hours, which at least makes people feel that the progress of the play is quite compact. This fully demonstrates the modernity of American movies, the fast tempo, the bright tone, the laughter, the superficial, the light and lively, so that the audience accepts the entertainment given to them by the author.</p>
<p>The beginning is so bright: the children's quarrelsome crying, the heroine can not sleep peacefully, the pain of the unemployed disappears in the laughter. This is at 6:30 in the morning. Then the heroine arrives at the electrical company. From the entanglement of love between the hero and heroine, to the heroine's flattered seduction by the manager, plus the atmosphere of the office, all fully express the sincerity of the petit bourgeois writer's sketch of the city, and these become the most brilliant performance of this film. All the way down to the office, almost to 6:30 in the afternoon, the elevator breaks down, making the plot suddenly tense. But neither the playwright nor the director succeeded here. The hero's singing completely destroys the tense atmosphere. If it is said that it is to gain the appreciation of the radio station owner, then there are plenty of opportunities to write it in other scenes, and there is no need to destroy the atmosphere here. The happy ending that followed was even more mediocre.</p>
<p>Judging from the ending, the playwright ultimately did not have her combine with the manager, which seems to be a more desirable place, and writing about the manager's collusion with female employees, in contrast to writing about the manager's wife and lover messing around, naturally has an expository meaning, but in the end, the manager and his wife end up as good as ever, so that what was written before becomes completely wasted. As for the heroine's immediate awakening because of the hero's bravery, regardless of whether the beauty really likes brave men so much, it always makes people feel forced. Such rashness is not an attitude that an artist should have. In this place, the vulgarity of the author is expressed.</p>
<p>Helen Twelvetrees' acting skills are very satisfying. She can act. And just right, in the first part completely expresses what the director wants to express. The male lead and the others all perform their duties mediocrely.</p>
<h3>Review of "Gift Gab"</h3>
<p>— You Jing</p>
<p>Gift Gab — Great Shanghai Screening —</p>
<p>I remember when sound films first emerged, "So-and-so Convention" and "So-and-so Gala Performance," these types of films featuring the entire cast of a company, so-called All Stars, were once extremely popular. Later, due to the regular application of sound technology, they progressed from chaotic patchwork to sound films with content and structure. However, things have changed, and All-Star films have been revived due to objective reasons.</p>
<p>The so-called objective reason is not that the audience needs this type of film again, but the motives for making these All-Star films before and after are absolutely not the same. The former was based on the limitations of sound film technology, and it was necessary to gather some singing and dancing scenes to cater to the general enthusiasm of the audience for sound films; the latter, however, is when the market is sluggish and business is depressed, they have to use All-Stars with cheap stars to attract the audience.</p>
<p>In order to allow every star who appears to have a role to play, and there is no story of that kind that meets this requirement, so this latter type of All-Star film, made under different conditions, naturally relapses into the old pattern of the former type in essence—no complete story, no sound script with a tight structure, just a piecemeal mix like a bowl of "mixed vegetables."</p>
<p>This "Gift Gab" is that kind of "mixed vegetables". The simple and clichéd story is about a brilliant student named Gabner who joins a radio broadcasting station as an announcer for broadcasting programs. He becomes famous because of the admiration of Miss Babola, a colleague. He loses his job because of being obsessed with a love triangle and falsely reporting news. Then, through a daring act, he restores his reputation, status, and love with a woman, ending in a happy reunion. —It’s very lively to call all the All Stars to appear.</p>
<p>Here, we don’t treat the so-called Valne of All Stars in "Gift Gab" as we should, we only need to see how the producers handle this All Star to know whether the film is successful or not. They painstakingly used the radio station as a magical treasure—a telescopic ring, incorporating a large number of stars in a comprehensive way, lengthening the picture, broadcasting famous songs, music teams, singing groups, and thrilling dramas co-starred by big stars, continuing without principles or tailoring. Perhaps the smart producers also felt the embarrassment of continuing like this? So they unscrupulously reused the familiar and tired-of-seeing sports competitions and jumps from airplanes. As for the lengthy and repetitive reports before the Radio, the vulgar and old-fashioned Happy Ending suffering the cold gaze of the audience, are even smaller things!</p>
<p>Naturally, there are also many successful aspects here, such as some of the humor in the dialogue and actions, the clown making funny faces, and the complex male and female relationships, all of which successfully won the laughter of the audience, although this cannot be said to be the success of the entire film.</p>
<p>Director Karl Frnnp managed to be busy for a while handling so many people and the things they were pulling. As for the lack of grasp of the dramatic atmosphere, it was determined by the script.</p>
<p>Among the big gatherings of thirty stars, no one competed to show off their skills. In terms of acting skills, Edmund Lowe, Rose Ading, and Phil Batur were only trying their best, and the rest were even more "not very good".</p>

<h3>National Sound (Bordertown) (6)</h3>
<p>— Xue Mei</p>
<p>The invitations have been sent out, and La Ruda—"Monte Carlo in the Desert"—will soon open... The meal fee is twenty-five yuan per person. That was Johnny's trick... Intended to attract upper class people—the aristocracy of society, and give them a good knock. Sure enough, the general upper class people arrived as scheduled. They came to this "Monte Carlo in the Desert" in groups, and were warmly entertained by the host Johnny Ramirez. He was wearing a tuxedo and dressed neatly. At this time, all the chaotic sounds of the silver shoes subsided. But in La Ruda, there was a Spanish atmosphere. Although the large restaurant was crowded with people, it still felt spacious. There were gambling tables upstairs and downstairs, but they were all located in secret places. And there was also a small band playing exquisite music.</p>
<p>The business of La Ruda on opening day was so good that it could not be better. Guests who arrived late without reserving a seat had almost no room to stand. They all had to ask the host Johnny Ramirez to make special arrangements. Mr. Jiang had to refuse politely. But once, he made a special accommodation. That was for a lady. She was not a regular customer there, but he knew her. He saw her standing at the entrance, and his heart couldn't help but thump. He also knew the companion she was with, who was a noble colleague who caused him to stop his law career.</p>
<p>When Dale Elwell saw him, she couldn't help but smile and said, "Really, are you the owner of this place?" Johnny smiled and replied, "Believe it or not." Her male companion interjected, "We have to find a table to sit down." Dale put her slender hand in Johnny's arm and smiled, "Come on, barbarian." Johnny said, "Barbarian? Do you think I don't know how to serve women and move chairs for them?" Dale said, "Don't rush. Let's try it out first." She had no affectation of arrogance. She and him seemed to be old acquaintances.</p>
<p>They sat together, they danced together. Finally, they sat together in the conservatory, a long window facing the desert outside. At this time, the bright moon hung high in the sky, shining on a flat and boundless sandy plain, which was very imposing. Dale couldn't help but admire, "It's really unbelievable that you were able to create such a situation in such a short period of time. I think your wife must be very happy." Johnny laughed, "I haven't married yet, so where would I get a wife?" Dale said strangely, "What? A handsome young man with a great career hasn't been caught yet?"</p>
<p>Dale was teasing him like this. He was a courageous man, but he was a clumsy man with no experience with the opposite sex. At this time, he couldn't help but stammer, "I—I—haven't talked about this before. You made me speechless for a moment." Dale said, "No way. You wouldn't be speechless. Your only fault is that you don't know how to pretend. Do you want me to teach you? Okay. Don't be too serious. Tonight is a night of love. It should be romantic, my good boy." As she said, she hooked her hand on Johnny's arm, leaned her head on his shoulder, and then asked, "Are you comfortable?" Johnny said, "No." Dale said, "I'll tell you a secret, I also feel a little uncomfortable, my heart is thumping."</p>
<p>Johnny was teased by her, and he was about to kiss her when Dale suddenly sat up straight and said, "Someone is coming." Johnny looked up and saw that it was none other than Mary Luke standing in front of them. She said, "I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation." Johnny got up angrily, grabbed Mary's arm and said, "Come here." He led her to his office and asked her, "What do you think you're doing? Running to this place to spy on my actions? Why did you interrupt when I was talking to someone else?" Mary laughed wildly for a while, and then her body and appearance gradually changed. Although she had grown fat, her face was still very haggard. Her eyes seemed to not see things accurately. (To be continued)</p>
