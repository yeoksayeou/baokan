<p>— 彥</p>
<p>據昨日英文大美晚報所傳消息。美商中國營業公司。繼合衆戲院公司。美豐銀行。美東銀公司。普益地產公司。與普益信託公司之後。援用美國因世界不景氣而制成之新法律。呈請美國駐華最高法院。准予改組。並派員保管其財產。據該公司新任經理伍雪弗向各股東宣稱。董事會此舉。意在保全股東之利益。蓋今歲三月初。該董事會調查公司經濟狀况後。本頗滿意。惟目前市况肅條。放出之欵。旣難收回。再欲續放。勢屬難能。乃不得不以改組爲出路。至公司債劵持票人。亦經該公司分別通知。所有該公司八釐抵押債券之到期付息。與七釐抵押債券之到期本息。一律暫吿停付。</p>
<p>美商中國營業公司。設立已及二十年五六年。前固爲上　地產市塲最活躍之一員。與美商普益。英商業廣兩地產公司。幾成鼎足之勢。往年上海地價暴漲。每年獲利。皰稱優異。股東官紅利所獲。有在週息三分以上者。由是該項股票與公司債。頗為衆業公所經紀人所注目。連年發展甚速。股本一再增高。公司債陸續發行。以現狀而論。實收股本約七百萬元。公司債之有確實担保者約六百餘萬元。無確實担保者。約一千萬元。公司資產總額。約五千五百萬元。據云負債資產可望相抵。惟就我人推測。該公司賬面資產或可與負債平當。然而目前地產慘落如此。股東利益究屬能否保全。恐當俟再度查帳後始　分　。</p>
<p>該公司股票及債劵四五年前。在市塲上頗稱活動。股票市價。且有高出倍餘者。　國商人因亦投資購買。爲數頗多。今該公司由美在華最高法院保管。着手改組。雖前途如何。未可臆斷。然而我持票人當時以高價購得者。今後恐未必仍能保持其善價。而無所損失。我國人已往迷信外商之謬誤心理。至此更可覺悟。抑我華人地產之轉取美商道契。由該公司經手掛號者。亦頗不少。彼等所持。僅一紙權柄單而已。改組以後。此類華人道契。能否完全收回。亦我商人之與該公司發生關係者所應關心之問題也。</p>

<p>朱氏繼謂、余此大乘赴爪哇考察糖業之便、對於國貨在荷印之銷路、加以險討、國貨之不能傾銷該處、蓋大半由於推銷方法之不良、如輸出貨物與貨樣不相符、失却僑胞之信仰、缺乏健全銷貨機關、不能與外貨抗衡等、余在爪哇時、曾與荷印經濟委員·巴城宋領事·泗水郭領事·中華商會會長·等晤談、發展對外貿易問題、各方對國貨銷售荷印一點、均願盡力扶助、巴城僑胞為圖發展國貨起見、有在巴城舉行國貨展覽會之議、不久當能成事實、尙望國人羣策羣力、與僑胞聯絡合作、爲國貨闢一發展之園地、外傳荷印政府禁止國貨進口、此訊不確、荷印禁止外貨入口、則係事實、惟其所禁者多係某國貨、至純粹中國物產、並不在禁止之例、加以相當限制則有之、</p>
<p>廣東糖業極為發達</p>
<p>朱氏末談、廣東爲我國產糖最盛之地、余特於返滬時、轉赴廣州考察、承廣東省農林局長、省府廣州區第一蔗糖廠經理馮銳氏梯霞）竭誠招待、道往各製糖廠參觀、得益非淺、各廠均置新式機器旣可用原料製糖、叉可以生坏煉糖、工廠設備、管理及工作人員之努力、均可供吾人之考鏡、所可情者、運輸方面、未臻完善、於糖業生產殊有影響、在爪哇製造廠與蔗田區間、滿佈輕便鐵道、運輸極爲便利、而在廣東、皆用船運·由於交通之不便、蔗之糖汁因而大减、倘能於此方面加以改進、則蔗之糖汁可增百分之六七、不出數年間、當可供給全國之需、此種糖廠率皆規模宏大、聞汕頭方面、明春亦有數家糖廠出現、</p>

<p>（八）金融勢力集中後之運用</p>
<p>上文己言、金融制度之進步、於力量集中及周轉靈活中見之近年以來、銀錢兩業、各有聯合準備之組織、數月以前、錢業又放棄其代理銀行業收解及收存銀行業準備之業務、使畸形的準備向下分散狀態、轉變爲正當的準備向上集中狀態、中央中國交通三銀行自增加資本改變組織之後、繼以若干發行銀行之轉移管理、金融力量集中之運動、至是而規模粗具、惟關於周轉靈活之設施、雖亦曾以中央中國交通三銀行向錢業能融押欵、以及組織工商業貸欵委員會向一般工商業通融資金之方式、分頭進行、然其趨向、仍爲依賴原有信用籌碼及現行放欵制度、爲補苴罅漏之計而未能積極推行現代的信用籌碼樹立金融業閎大之規模、此固因大難當前、喘息未定、遠謀難以遽見、然衡以多難興邦之旨、則今後之努力、自當集中於運用新信用籌碼以達周轉靈活之目的、藉以造成金融業劃時代的進步也、</p>
<p>以言公司債之發行、陳委員小蝶曾有以公司債引換金融公債之建議、此於建立工商業長期資金市塲之進行、恐有窒礙、蓋公司債引換國債之後、市塲上所有者、將仍爲公債庫券、而公司債不與焉、換霄之、即臼下之證券市塲、將仍爲財政證券市塲，而不能產生工商業長期資金市塲、而當此國家財政入不敷出之際、政府在公債發行上、須預留邊際、以為財政上緩急之　、其能否運用較多之餘力、以供公司債引換之用、亦屬疑問也、同人之意、以爲公司債之推進、其最重要之機構、爲承受機關及賣買市塲、關於後者、華商證券交易所自可負其任務、關於前者、上文雖主張由各銀行儘量倡導承受、但收效迂緩、亦屬無可諱言、欲爲應急之圖、自須另闢谿徑、目下中央信社局巳籌備就緒、如能以該局爲中心、聯合金融業、分別組織各種銀團、以爲各種公司債發行之承受、則收效自速也、按承受業務、原屬信託業務之一種、中央信託局顧名思義自可擔承、一切新運動之推進、最切要者、厥爲中心勢力之建立、中央信託局負此任務、如能倡導於前、金融業自不難追隨於後、使底於成、此較諸由政府直接以引換公債方式爲有限之援助、自更勝一籌也、</p>
<p>銀行承兌匯票及商業承兌滙票之推進、其主要關鍵、爲國家銀行之再貼現、蓋必國家銀行能予一般金融業以再貼現之便利、然後一般金融業者有恃無恐、能以購買及貼現票據方式、對工商業者爲有力之通融、國家銀行對一般金融業之通融、除在國際收支入不敷出之際、必須運出現金以外、平時殆僅一轉賬之勞蓋普通銀行之準備金、多已集中於國家銀行、甲銀行應付之欵、往往即爲乙銀行應收之欵、國家銀行給與甲銀行之通融、往往即轉入乙銀行在國家銀行之存欵戶也、我國目下中央中國交通三銀行、巳成三位一體之局、準備金集中於三行之勢、亦大體完成、以三行之合作、其能負担再貼現之任務、自無待言、而發行方面、如能仿照東西各國先例、酌量　入銀行承兌濾票及商業承兌匯票、作爲保證準備則三行再貼現業務中所收受之票據、即可轉變為保證準備以增加發行、是則對於增加支付籌碼之要求、亦不期然而巳與以滿意之解决也、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c158">南洋杯甲組單打决赛　王文正再勝邱飛海　苦戰五盤王先敗後勝　體力不如邱海屈服 <a href="#c158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>上海網球會主辦之南洋杯網球賽、昨日邱飛海對王文正决賽之結果、邱再以二比三爲王文正所敗、冠軍遂爲王得、邱在高級單打中、曾爲王敗、滿擬報復、但卒以年華老去、體力不如、已勝仍敗、深爲可惜、全運會中、極在體力上加以休養、庶幾有望也、昨尙有表演數塲、併誌於下、</p>
<p>邱飛海黃金時代　昨日王邱兩人、因爲擊法相同、唯一之戰具爲底綫抽擊、故精彩較少、最初之三盤、王文正殊不能顯其顏色、球之管束力、甚爲薄弱、然而此亦爲邱飛海之黃金時代、上塲二人簡實難分高下、惟邱稍佔優勢、但第一盤邱以四比二佔先、結果連失四局、以四比六敗、第二盤邱又以四比二居先、各回之後、邱連下二局、以六比四奪回第二槃、第三盤邱以極精彩之擊法、兩角對抽、遠近莫測、以三比一、四比二、五比三、而卒以六比三得勝、</p>
<p>王文正後來居上　在此三盤中、邱飛海操縱局面、使王文王疲於奔命、論擊法確在王之上、但邱之疲態、已完全暴露、休息片刻之後、繼續作戰、邱竟疲乏至不堪應對、連以二個光盤奉送王文正、在第五盤之一二兩局、邱曾傾全力以取勝、結果已有餘力不足、故昨日之决赛、顯然以體力分勝負、論擊法邱在王上也、</p>
<p>雙打賽精彩表演　上海會敦聘之西人表演雙打賽山錢耀彬與特孚搭配陳志强與卡遜搭配、卡特爲滬上名手、而錢陳亦華人中之少年新進、昨與卡特搭擋、居然天衣無縫、上網退守、精彩萬分、第一盤特孚錢耀彬占勝、第二盤則爲卡陳得平、惟時間巳晚、未能賽、畢丙組周家騏對陳其浩之却令治賽、亦頗精彩、各項成績如下、</p>
<p>詹文耀對王叔慶（王棄權）</p>

<p>實力緊　勝負難測</p>
<p>秀瓊秀珍姊妹、近來成績大晋、許久際違、兩晚中定有特殊成績、惜蛙王郭振恒、此次代表廣東、未能參加盛會、至港隊本屆實力、雖異常雄厚、而滬方中西兩隊、亦非弱者、梁偉生於近亦進步甚速與港陳振興當有肉搏、而埠際選手簡而潔施博根、叉於今日可返滬、更爲滬隊添一支生力軍、老將周瑞琴黃日雄小將簡而廉等、日來養精蓄銳、預備力拚、擬對港隊先施一下馬威也、</p>
<p>公共汽車增六十輛</p>
<p>此項競賽、市府現正積極籌備、預測雙方實力緊湊、當為市池開幕　以來之第一次盛况、屆時觀衆、定必擁擠、特囑華商公共汽車公司增加公共汽車六十輛、不停留開行、以减擁擠、並聞本屆港隊經費、異常短絀、各項代表隊來滬川資、現尙無着落、故特先遺游泳足球兩隊先來、至兩晚門票收入、除開市外、市府將悉以贈諸港隊、以壯行色、其餘各隊、尙須待表演賽券資匯去後方能來滬、計劃中尙有港足球隊與滬上勁旅表演、現正在　洽中云、</p>

<p>裴先生看見了那個牛，聽見了那個故事，他並沒多說話，分明是深恐驟聞之下一時抑勒不住，要說得過火了的。他只把老黃花安頓在她的棚裏，並且要童子們各回自己的房間，到晚餐時再出來。</p>
<p>這麼一次短的休息給他們一個機會把這件事想過一次，猜想要受什麼的責罰，並且想像到唐恩將被送到那裏去。他在自己房間裏，儘是自以口吹嘯着，擺出他毫不在意的態度；然而當他在靜待着他命運的决定時，留戀的欲念卻逐漸强盛起來，當他愈回想到他在這裏所得到的安適與好待，以及他在別地各處所遭遇的苦楚與冷漠。他知道他們是想帶助着他的，在他心的底處實在也是感激的，可是他向所遇翁粗魯的生活使他成爲冷酷，草率，猜疑，而復頑强的人，他恨然任何一切的拘束，即使有時他知道這是善意的，而且也似乎覺得他實在可以得到它的利益，可是他還德是反抗着它，眞像一個難馴的野獸。他决心去再過那流浪的生活，在街市裏東碰西撞游來游去，正像他從前一生所經過的一般；想到那種前途竟使他緊織着他的兩道粗黑的眉毛，環顧那舒適的小房間表出不勝依戀之態，如果裴先生見了這個，他的心腸即使硬了幾倍，也必爲之感動。這些念頭卻立即消逝。當那個好人走了進來，以其固有的莊重的神情說道：</p>

<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>太極拳有幾種打法。在都市，老爺，少爺，太太，奶奶就喜歡整日整夜傍着碰和桌子打太極拳！據說那種「推手」功夫，雖說「路數」各異，但「養心」「安神」的效果却是一樣的。</p>
<p>我現在所要說的太極拳並不是這樣。</p>
<p>十多年前，我在北平就看到打太極拳的人很多，春夏兩季淸晨的中央公園，簡直變了一所體育塲，到處有人在打拳。內中有位年逾古稀的老叟打得最勤，沒有一天朝晨不見到他。因爲逐日相見，我就認識了他，並且聽到他和我說的許多關於太極拳的好處。</p>
<p>據他說，人們一過中年，苟不注意攝　，大都火盛水衰，這於身體是有極大危害的。太極拳最大的功效就在調劑「水」「火」，使人體內部充實。他並且說打太極拳如果到了超頂的功夫，一切「火　」自會消滅，眞有「謙謙君子」之風！絕沒有打外家拳的那種好勇鬥狠的氣槪！」</p>
<p>對放太極拳功能調劑「水」「火」充實內部這幾點，我是贊同的，如果說打了太極拳就會消滅一切火氣，變成一個謙謙君子！那我想還是不打的好！因爲我們中國人個性上最大的弱點，就在缺少相當的「火氣」！想做謙謙君子的人太多，！因此能够表示一種勇毅不屈的精神的人已嫌太少！如何經得起再打太極拳！</p>
<p>有人說，强身是一件事，火氣又是一件事，我們首先要使個個人强身，然後再去激發他們正當的「火氣」，這才可以相輔並進。因爲「强身」和「火氣」都是不能　廢的事情。</p>
<p>找想，這句話或許倒是對的。</p>
<h3 id="c187">歌女的血淚語 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 江瘦秋</p>
<p>在朋友張先生的宴會席上，遇到一個比較熟識的某歌女，伊在酒闌人散的時候，談了一談歌女們的痛苦。</p>
<p>據伊說：歌女本來是拿技術混飯吃的，因爲伊們是個歌者，憑着天賦的喉隴；平常的研究，在淸唱茶社裏，拿幾十元的包銀，養活一家大小，這在自立的立塲說：也是一種正當的職業。但是一般聽唱的人，却並不在乎唱的好壞，而注重生的　醜；尤其是臉盤子好，而褲帶子又鬆的人，最容易受人歡迎，如果是規規矩矩歌女，那簡直沒有人肯加以援助，因爲這般聽衆，都是醉翁之意不在酒啊！</p>
<p>就因爲有這種狀况，所以一般歌女們，不得不犧牲自己，來圖全家的生存，要知道在這米珠薪桂的現在，僅靠幾個包銀，不但養活不了家裏人，就是維持自己也不够，於是不得不迎合社會聽衆的需要，而作那種無恥的副業了！所以歌女們的賣淫，實在是實逼處此，也可以說是惡劣的社會所賜予的。要知道一個人總想向上的，但是在不得已的時候，也祇得犧牲了！</p>
<p>伊說完　些話，兩頰上掛滿了淚痕，我和張先生，也都替伊們不平！眞的，社會待伊們是太慘酷了！伊們雖然想作買藝一不賣身的歌者，在事實上是不可能啊！唉！</p>

<p>第十九回　大員惜羽毛敲門有術新歡離骨肉探病無由</p>
<p>再看時，月英竟是坐在地上，衣服沾了許多塵，伏在椅子上，哭得兩隻肩膀，左起右落，只管顫動。雖不看到他的臉，只聽他那嗚嗚的哭聲，也可以想到他是傷心已極。在這個時候，送化妝品給人，這未免是充量開玩笑。可是這化妝品綑紮一大包，正提在手上，事實上又不能把東西拋了却也急得臉上一陣通紅。賈多才一肚子悲憤，正恨着無可發洩，見士賡這種躊躇不前的樣子，便道：士廉你只管進來坐，這算不了什　。哼！我早把醜丟盡了的。李士　搭訕着走進去，面桌子上吹了兩口灰，把化妝品放下。這才從容的向月英道：我們這位新嫂子。你跟着賈老爺，是一步登天了，那些不好，爲什麼你總是哭哭啼啼的。而且　旣是太太了，也就該跟着賈老爺學些規矩，怎好賴在地上哭起來？賈多才聽着這話，頓起脚來，就歎了一口氣。月英扶着椅子站起來縮到屋角落　，慢慢的撲去了身上的灰，又　身上抽出一方手絹來，揉擦了一　眼睛，這就手理着　髮，向士廉道；李先生，你說那話，我怎麼不明白？並非是我白已賴着坐在地上的。我聽說我奶奶病得很　，想回去看看，昨晚就哀求賈老爺起，哀求到現在，賈老爺總是不肯。後來我就說，賈老爺眞是不放心的話，可　同我一路回去看看，好在路不遠，這小西天後　就是。（　二六）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>太后往往會舉起手來；很有興味地揣詳着；並用鼻子聞着，久久不厭。伊不但自己歡喜如此，而且還要敎我們也學着伊做；然而我們終不能像伊一樣的戚到有什麼興趣，祇在如厠以後，或手上沾到了什麼腥臭的東西，才去採些菊花的綠葉來擦擦，藉以抵消那股汚氣，等閑時誰也不高興去糟場那些花兒。</p>
<p>菊花之中，據說還有一種最希罕的名種喚做「綠牡丹」，它的顏色是綠的；决非淺綠，而是深綠。花中綠色的最少，固不獨菊花如此，而在菊花中綠色的似乎格外的絕無僅有，我久已聽人說過有「綠牡丹」這麼一種菊花，但我委實不曾見過。太后自然也早就知道有此異種，所以在好幾年以前，便不斷的派人出去搜尋了：當然經伊這樣一位頂天立地的女政治家發出去的命令，那裏會有全無影響的道理？不久就有許多人獻了好幾十盆標着「綠牡丹」三字的菊花來，可是它們所開的花都祇略帶一些綠色的氣味，實在够不上稱「綠」字，太后如何能滿意呢？便繼續尋求，後來又有人送了寥寥的四盆來，一瞧花色果然是像綠玉一般的綠，可是陳列了幾天，顏色忽又淡下去了；經太后親自去仔細一騐，才知是人家用綠顏色把白菊花染好了來混充的。這一來自然很使伊動氣，那進花的人險些因此跌進鐵窗子裏去。（四二六）</p>

<p>— 甲辰生</p>
<p>揚州閒話云者，以別於易君左之閒話揚州耳，且本文所寫，爲確切道地之揚州閒話，蓋遊揚歸來之雪泥鴻爪云。</p>
<p>「腰纏十萬貫，騎鶴上揚州，」這是古人的豪舉。在下窮措大，雖無十萬貫可供遨遊，而豪情却不减於古人。乃在新秋時節，乘輪下揚州，遊覽此一一分明月所在地。一償宿願。</p>
<p>揚州不獨爲江北之首埠，近且由政府特闢爲住宅區，要人之卜居於斯者，現正紛至沓來，原揚州現時環境，於文明開化中仍存敦厚古樸之風味，誠爲不可冬得之居住所也。</p>
<p>揚州名勝，雖未可與名聞天下之蘇杭州相提並論，然瘦西湖平山堂綠楊邨等處，亦正大足留連，且純粹爲天然境界，絕無人工　雜其間，得大自然之氣，正是其平淡淸幽勝人處。</p>
<p>揚州之交通，水陸均極暢達，自江蘇全省公路建築後，益見便利，現時除揚鎭汽車與京滬鐵路火車啣接外，更有北達徐海，西接天長，南達京蕪之各路長途汽車之駛行，內河小輪之航行綫，尤以揚州爲總匯，南京班·六合班·淸江班·高郵班·泰州班·興化班·通揚班等不一而足，長江輪船上下水，亦均有停泊，若霍家橋，八江口等處，僅距城十里許耳，如蘇建廳計劃進行之省東鐵路（省會至東台）得依期完成，該埠更爲衝要之區矣。</p>
<p>揚州之日常生活，極爲平凡，較之蘇滬，不及二分之一，與首都相比，則祗及三之一耳，八口之家，有二三十元一月之收入，大可安居樂業而無慮。因之京省間一班公務人員，移作揚州寓公者，不乏其人，良以賃屋三楹，月僅租金兩元，其他一切日常用品，魚鹽蔬菜，靡不價格公道，無怪各方之來歸者，日益增多也</p>
<p>揚州之小食館子，其價廉物美處，尤爲任何地方所不及，予在揚州小住旬餘，幾乎每餐必上館子，而所費之代價，等於自家買小菜，若三知己共食，更爲便宜，小東門外之彩虹樓與中華飯店兩家，殊屬特色，炒鱔魚，炒蝦仁，蹄肚湯三樣，僅售千文，足供　四人而有餘，且各色均極新鮮可口。</p>
<p>揚州在過去時代，因鹽商雲集，市面爲之繁榮不少，今則因鹽　北遷淮海，地面所受之影響極大，百業俱見衰洛，現以住宅區之劃定，客民日增，頗有復興氣概。</p>
<p>揚州新開事業，雖開發極早，迄無成就，現下日刋報紙，計之不下十餘種，無一可供閱覽者，鎭江省會之新江蘇報與蘇報，反在該地暢銷，滬上各大報，僅見申報新聞報時報之蹤跡，因交通便利，每日午後五時許，即能披閱當日報紙，首都中央日報亦日有到達云。</p>

<h3 id="c212">由盧梭到白璧德的過程 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 王集叢</p>
<p>如果培根是近代科學的始祖時，那麼，盧梭便可說是隨着文　復興生起來的近代思想的始祖。盧梭的這種個人主義與自由主義的思想，不做在政治上和一般思想上發生了很大的作用，而且在文學上還有莫大的影響。盧梭本人就是一位文學作家，在他的一般論著和其所謂辯論體的小說裹，都可以看到與上述那種思想相結合着的他的文學主張。他以發展個性去代替古典主義的人間性；他反對古典主義的規律和理性，主張解放感情，任隨感情自由地奔放。假使絕對主義的古典主義的思想是靜的思想時，那我們便可說反對古典主義的盧梭的思想是動的思想。他是過着動的漂泊生活的人；而且，依他的自述，他還是一個以爲身體手足是以感情和想像去與之對立的。</p>
<p>這樣的盧梭的文學思想，實在是浪漫主義的全部思想體系。許多文學史家說盧梭是浪漫主義的創始者，並非過甚其詞的說法。假使浪漫主義，是新興的工業市民爲了要打破妨害他建設自己的文學的桎梏而產生出來的文學思潮的話，那麼，浪漫主義的創始者盧梭，也可說是工業市民的文學上的先鋒，近代文學的開路人了。</p>
<p>但是，在十八世紀的時候，工業市民是正在勃興期中的。那時他們爲了要獲得自由貿易的權利，爲了要反對貴族的統制，使自身走上政治舞台，所以，才積極地主張自由民主，發揚個人主義，解放感情。所謂盧梭思想，也就是十八世紀的工業市民的那種思想的反映。及至十九世紀，近代市民文學雖有許多變動，他們的文學難表現出了由浪漫主義到寫實主義的發展，但因那時他們還在向上成長，所以在根本上還未背叛由盧梭所代表的他們初期的那種思想。然而時間前進到了二十世紀，不活動則腦筋也就不能活動的人。他曾說道：「我在一個塲所　止着的時候，幾乎什麼也不能想；爲了我的精神活動，我的身體活動是必要的。」因此他常旅行，活動，四處漂泊。他的全部生活，可說是動的生活。與此動的生活相結合着的，則是他的動的思想：反抗現實，反對人爲，主張自然，要求自由。因爲憎惡現實，愛好自然，所以盧梭又得視想像。他對於古典主義的理性和規律，便特別是在大戰前夜，近代社會在各方面都顯示出了牠的病態和危機，一切客觀事實都證明了牠楚已經走到了歷史所給與牠的道路的盡頭。於是，近代社會的主人市民也就感到了盧梭思想對他不僅無益而且有害，於是，反對盧梭思想的呼聲便從各方面傳了出來、白璧　敎授的所謂人文主義便是從此湧現出來的。</p>
<p>白璧德敎授的人文主義，就表面看來，好像是十七八世紀的古典主義的復活，但在實際上牠却是有新的意義的。這新的意義便在於牠是大戰前後的產物。在白璧德敎授看來，二十世紀所發生的許多危險的社會現象，乃至殘酷的戰爭，都是由於培根的物質主義與盧梭的自由主義所引導出來的，所以，爲要避免戰爭，消除一切危險的社會現象，他便以「人事之律」來代替了「物質之律」，以敎人「循規蹈矩」「不走極端」來代替了自由主義。假使人們眞的這樣聽說，大家都「循規蹈矩」，「不走極端」，那天下便可太平無事，而已經走上末路的近代社會也就可以永存不減了。但不如意的事情，仍在繼續發生，白璧德的人文主義並未顯示出大的作用來，因此使得白璧德敎授更不得不進一步去乞憐於上帝，宗敎；他曾公然表示要維持現狀，便非請釋迦，耶穌出來不可。</p>
<p>在文學上白璧德敎授及其門徒們是完全贊成古典主義的理論的。</p>
<p>古典主義的文藝思潮，是存在於十七八世紀的，白璧德敎授的人文主義的文藝思想，便是古典王義的思想；在這一點上，我們便可以說牠是一種復古思想。同時，假使盧梭是近代市民勃興期中的代言人，白璧德主義乃是已經走上了來路的市民的思想的反映時，那麼，我們叉可以說白璧德主義乃是發展到最後階段的一種市民思想。因爲走上末路的近代市民，在保持其最後的生命上需要復古，需要走到十七八世紀去把古典主義復活起來，所以便產生了白璧德敎授的人文主義。在這里，便有了所謂發展到最後階段的市民思想，與復古思想的統一。</p>
<p>盧梭的思想是初期的市民思想，所以是前進的；白璧德主義乃是走上了末路的市民思想，所以是後退的。從盧梭思想到白璧德敎授的人文主義，便是近代市民思想的所由發生，發展走向沒落的一個過程。</p>

<p>— 褚雅鳴</p>
<p>（不聽媽媽底話的女孩子）</p>
<p>當我還是小孩的時候，我就常常聽見大人們口裏有兩個喜歡說的句子。</p>
<p>「你難道要做阿勝麼？」</p>
<p>「沒有阿祥，沒有阿勝！」</p>
<p>他們爲什麼那樣喜歡這兩句話，好像牠們是構成完整的生命的重要部份呢，開頭在我是覺得難以解釋的。他們判斷了一個女孩子實在是膽大妄爲，或者淘氣胡鬧，或者甚至有一點點違反尊長們的命令的時候，就駡了：</p>
<p>「你難道要做阿勝麼？」</p>
<p>後來我到底從老姑媽底叙述裏聽到關於阿勝，那不聽媽媽底話的女孩子底故事了。她底神氣是那樣敬畏而嚴肅的，彷彿她正在講到關於一個神的傳說。</p>
<p>「永昌號是桂鄉一間最大的絲廠，全廠有九巷，每巷兩隻船，一隻船有五十僩位子，一共有九百個女工那麼多。」老姑媽閉上眼睛，凄凉地描寫從前那些繁榮的日子。「你可以想得到的，自然每一巷有一個男的巡巷。他們是用來稽查那些女工有沒有偷懶的，整天間閒散散地兩頭走，高興就跟那些女工談談天。有些女孩子想巴結他們，有些想用他們夾散散悶，但有些「生疳」的却望都不望他們一下。不過，要是這樣，他們會老羞成怒的，硬說你做得粗，立刻「兜繭」，不許你做。她們都怕那些巡巷的</p>
<p>一管第一巷的巡巷是一個呌做祥哥的男人。有一天他留心到一個新來的年輕的女工，長得眞漂亮，全廠的女工沒有一個比得上她；可是她整天都不做聲，乖低頭做活，祥哥不歇地在她左右巡來巡去，想跟她兜搭，看見她老是閉着嘴，就更肉緊，更心急，使得旁邊的女孩子對她都羨慕，妬忌起來了。她就是阿勝。</p>
<p>「阿祥馬上打聽出來，阿勝只有一個很老的媽媽，她很孝順她，什麼都聽她底話，而她們是很窮的。阿祥打定主意，一直去找她底媽媽，把什麼事情都商量好了。阿勝自己也不知道什麼原故，忽然由小師父的位子升了做二師父。那個時候做一師父眞是不輕容易，哼，一天有六毛錢工錢呢！</p>
<p>「到了得陽節晚上了。阿勝底媽媽自己做了一桌菜，買了許多酒，請阿祥吃飯。阿勝喝醉了，什麼都不曉得，這也是有點作孽，她媽媽就把阿祥留下來，和阿勝睡在一牀了！</p>
<p>「後來阿勝知道了自己碰到過什麼事情，就和媽媽吵起嘴來。唉，她們動手打起來了，那忤逆的女孩子把她底媽媽打傷了，眼睛腦袋都給什麼東西砸裂了。阿勝第二天丟下了媽媽，一個人逃到省城去，第二年，她底媽媽就死掉了。」</p>
<p>「你不是說她媽媽有點作學的麼？」我抗辯了。</p>
<p>「作孳是作孽的，這有什麼說的呢！她就是把她切開幾截，或者把她吃掉了，她仍然是她底媽媽！媽媽生得出她，就呌她死也沒有什麼不可以；何况是婚姻的事情，媽媽要完全做主的。」</p>
<p>但我知道老姑媽是在對我扯謊了，她一定隱藏起什麼東西不肯吿訴我，因爲她所說的話跟她說話時的惋惜而敬重的表情，是極不一致而且互相矛盾的。</p>
<p>我跑去問那個會替人家書符醫病趕鬼安家的喃巫鍾道一，一個窮而多病的老酒鬼，他常常在喝醉酒的時候，跑到我們底門口捶我們那兩扇大木門，或者躺在街心睡覺的。</p>
<p>「你底姑媽會駡我，她會一個銅板都不給我！」</p>
<p>「可是你爲什麼碰到霉事，或者別人欺負了你，你就說「沒有阿祥，沒有阿勝』呢？你很喜歡做阿勝的麼？」</p>
<p>「少胡說八道，你這小鬼！」他這樣駡我，但其實他是很高興的，於是他就用他那些不完全的話語說下去了！</p>
<p>「我是說，那些全家剷，他們立意要害我，也許反而成全了我的。他們要呌我吃虧，也許反而讓我佔了便宜！阿勝在大家心裏而活着，是長生不老的……</p>
<p>「她媽媽死了之後的第年，阿勝這顆彗星，就回到桂鄉來了。她去的時候是個一附絲女」，回來的時候就變成一個自由女，一個女學生，一個女王！……除了她自己，沒有個人敢提到過去的事情的，她自己敢，而且常常在老爺鄕紳面前說起來，使他們爲難……那時候，他們在她面前連笑都不能够笑……有什麼法子呢？鄉裏面的自衛軍聽她底話，知縣常常要請她飲茶，　着馬，和多少男人在街上跑來跑去，那些男人是誰都不敢招惹的！</p>
<p>「開頭，阿祥一聽見阿勝同到桂鄉，就在半夜裏預備偷偷跑掉，但是沒有成功，呌幾個自衛軍押解回來了。那些自衛軍都曉得他們從前的事情的，就把他推到阿勝面前，說：「勝姑，你還記　他嗎？他就是阿祥，從前做巡巷，現在做　可理，家，面有　個老婆了。你　　請他吃點什麼東西呢？」「好的，讓我來看淸楚些，你們把繩了解開了吧！」她走到他身邊；用馬鞭　他　他抽了幾　下，隨後呌人　他帶到軍法處去。</p>
<p>他們判　做　　，洗馬　　運子彈，天到晚　桑田上摘桑葉，得到的工錢就充公。身嬌肉貴的阿祥受不住了，更受不住的是摘桑的那些女工整天嘲笑她們底新夥計，唱起歌來臭駡他……於是有一個晚上，他就在馬房裏面自己吊頸死掉了。</p>
<p>許多女人都學着她底榜樣，穿上白衫黑裙在大街上游行的第二天，我碰見了她。她到我家裏坐了很久，說起許多從前的事情……「不要做喃巫了，將來會沒有一個人相信你和你底法術，你就得慢慢地餓死！到我那里去，找點別的事情做做吧。」她這樣對我說，還　了一張紙條子給我。</p>
<p>「可是我不去找她。我有點怕她，而且知道他們都不喜歡我，或者又是呌我做苦工，我比阿祥更吃不得苦的。</p>
<p>「但是這顆地彗星底話到底靈　了，現在，我不是慢慢地在餓死了麼？不過，她說人家會不相信我，那是不對的。人家都相信我，比從前無論什麼時候更相信，只是他們沒有錢；出不起發喊我去作法罷了？」</p>

<p>— 胡依凡</p>
<p>在一條瀝靑瀝靑的溝裏，一位捕魚人巳沒在水裏了老半天。</p>
<p>溝是不滿五六丈長，約莫二丈實；但這裏是這一村子人藏垢納汚的泉源啦。除了飲料，他們可以在一個沒有蓋頭，也沒有井牆的公井裏吸出一桶桶的渾水以外，從淘米洗菜，漿衣以至倒馬桶，他們都依仗着這條小溝。</p>
<p>此刻，小溝的兩邊便排蹲着堆子人。</p>
<p>拍拍拍，搗衣杆一下一下的落了下去，娘兒們的話是永遠不會停。項有興味的，是談阿三的離婚：</p>
<p>「阿三那能肯答應第能樣格事體？」</p>
<p>「不答應？你呌阿三拿什麼去養家？」</p>
<p>「總總呌嘸來法子想纔肯離婚　，阿是？阿娘？」</p>
<p>「對格。現在當男人阿交關難，工尋勿着做，別格生路阿嘸末，家主婆軋姘頭有啥格法子好想？男人勿肯做光眼烏龜，女人末，自家勿尋生路阿勿成功；第格是呆板格。」</p>
<p>談論到這裏，大家看着老太婆那種搖頭咕嘴，有把握不過的神氣，不自覺地都歇住了手，笑了。然而這笑，是顯得多麼淡漠而叉無力呀！</p>
<p>「這祇好怪市面不好呀！阿三多麼勤快的一個後生，不失業那能會離婚？聽人講阿三　想自…自……自殺……」</p>
<p>爛眼皮的雲弟的娘還沒說完了下去，路邊籬笆上碰的響了一發槍聲，麻霍驚得飛了起來。那邊立刻出現着一個西裝上衣馬褲的維特式的靑年，擎着一支紅柄黑汽槍，氣昂昂地立在那裏東張西望，尋找他的目的物。</p>
<p>她們倒抽了口冷氣，胸口仆仆地跳，各人輕輕吐了口唾沫。</p>
<p>「赫煞哉，嚇煞哉，斷命畜生！」語昔立刻是變得那麼低弱了起來，變得幾乎要聽不出了。</p>
<p>於是一陣沉默。從經騐吿訴她們：連公子哥兒都出來散步游獵了，辰光是不早了吶。於是她們更手忙脚亂做起了生活來。</p>
<p>世界顯然是變了，這裏雖是一個村莊，現在雖是一個淸晨，但人們早已沒了先前的閒逸，變得更勞累了，生活反變得侷促起來。</p>
<p>田間，早聽不見了牧童的歌聲，名士的吟唱，有的祇是嘆氣，呌苦，連她們也知道了：離婚，失業，自殺……這一連串新鮮的名詞！</p>
<p>一天的開始，就展開了一幅怎樣慘淡灰暗的世界！（完）</p>

<p>這時候，牧師才慢慢抬起頭來遠遠溜病人一眼：瘦削的臉上都結着一塊塊的大黑疤。長亂的頭髮。眼睛正向上伸着。胸部好像還在微微顫動。</p>
<p>「那末，好，藍醫生拿出一本簿子來，「你幾歲？」</p>

<p>— 馮善樑醫生</p>
<p>傳梁淋病之後。淋病之源菌淋毒雙球菌。卽日尿道口侵入尿道。起初時候。淋病侵入尙淺。在前尿道。卽先發生急性淋病。此時當卽內服淋病特效藥品「滅殺淋。」外用「淋毒舒藥耳」。迅速將淋菌殺滅。淋病卽可根治。若遷延不治。或治療不甚合法。淋菌未能殺凈。淋病未曾斷根。淋菌卽漸侵入後尿道。從亞急性淋病而成慢性淋病。再漸侵入膀胱。成膀胱脫炎。侵入攝護腺。成攝護腺炎。而傳至睪丸。遂成了睪丸炎等淋病合切症。</p>
<p>淋菌從前尿道侵入後尿道。再由精阜。輸精管而侵入睪丸。成為淋毒性睪丸炎時。因睪丸的腫大。常有認為小腸。（卽疝氣）不知小腸氣病的原因。因小腸從腹腔脫下。墜入陰囊所致。在醫學上謂之「脫腸症」。與淋毒性睪丸炎。大不相同。因淋毒性睪丸炎。完全為淋菌侵入睪丸而發生炎症。為淋病合切之一種。</p>
<p>淋病性睪丸炎初起之時。覺在鼠蹊部分有牽引感觸。陰囊中睪丸之一。漸有沉重脹大之發現。乃有沉重而發生極烈刺痛。由痛而漸漸紅腫。陰囊亦發生腫而脹痛。漸成腫大。有時竟大至半倍以上。行動不便。舉步不易。睡時尙有可忍耐。立起之時。似有一極重物件。下垂於跨下。如有咳嗽。尤為疼痛。病人又發惡高熱。疲憊不堪。如此經過半月。紅腫禱有時消退。必結成硬塊。若硬塊結成。如欲消去。則非短時間內可以辦到。故一得淋病。宜速卽治療。將淋菌殺凈。不便遺漏。致侵入睪丸。發生淋毒性睪丸炎等惡症。方為上策也。（編者按。法界寗波路六十六號。春在醫院。治療淋病。有極可靠之把握。院中設備周密。如治療淋病之短波電療器等。無不齊備。且收費奇廉。收效則迅速無比。實為患淋病者之福音。又淋病內服藥品。最有特效者。內服藥當推滅殺淋。外治藥則　淋毒舒樂耳為第一。皆屬敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社所經售。各大藥房如南洋。永安先施等公司。均有出售。患淋病者切勿失之交臂。）</p>

<p>— 崔馥卿醫師</p>
<p>遺精。早洩。均為神經衰弱病之一種。其成因不外乎手淫與房事過度而起。以手淫與房事過度之後。必致精液枯竭。消耗過甚。內分泌液。减退而成為神經衰弱症。以致遺精。早洩。等病。逐次發現。其原因為人體管轄性慾神經系統以及中樞靈敏靈甚。梢呈刺戟。立卽興奮。將精液射出。成遺精與早洩之現象。人體精液。最為寶貴。其來源由於睪丸製造供給。因副畢丸之作用。於輸精管輸入精囊壁。一部流入淋巴管至血管。循環於血液中。作為營養。一部由動脈仍歸睪丸。再成精液。成精液循環。遺精過多。及手淫房事過度。均能使精液消耗。生理上產生之新血液。不能補充。於是腦脊髓及神經系統漸漸枯竭。釀成神經衰弱。乃致早洩。又成為種種因此而起之疾病。如腦病。胃病。性器管病。心臟病等。故遺精。早洩病症。實可為種種疾病之根源。可以影響生命危險。絕對不可忽視。遺精。早洩的原因。旣不外乎排洩過多。致神經系生殖器管。內分泌營養不足所致。其治療方法。自以補充入體內分泌液。及補充人體補神經之要品憐質為主。「安爾神」藥品。即為最可靠之內分泌燐質製劑。對於神經衰弱之治療。有特殊奇效。亦卽治療遺精與早洩之特效藥品也。</p>
<h3 id="c219">女子不孕與淋病 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 劉玄</p>
<p>女子不姙。可分為天然生理上有了缺點。不能生育。與因了疾病。不能生育兩種。因生理不姙之女子。極為少見。大都以疾病不姙為多。女子之不姙病症。原因亦有多種。但因患淋病而致不姙者。最為普遍而常見。在醫學實騐上之統計。調查女子不姙症之原因。十分之六七。為由患淋病而起。故淋病之於女子生育。有絕大關係。</p>
<p>男子傳染淋病。淋菌最先侵入尿道。女子則第一侵犯至膣腔與子宮。淋菌侵入膣腔之時。引起膣炎。侵入子宮之後。必引起子宮膜炎與實質炎。即多變成不姙症之原因。淋病又能使子宮位置變化。尤為不姙症之一絕大原因。</p>
<p>在女子患淋病後。淋菌自子宮而侵入喇叭管。發生喇叭管炎。變為膿瘍。甚至喇叭管完全閉塞。則竟成為一種絕對不姙症之原因。再進而至卵巢。引起卵巢炎。卵子成熟。已為妨碍。不能有排作用。自亦為不姙症之一種。尙有因淋病而致子宮。卵巢。喇叭管發生腫瘍。子宮位置變化。亦均為由淋病而成女子不姙症之原因。此外尙有一最大原因。女子得淋病後。常致不姙。因男子所射出之精蟲。經含有淋菌之膣腔。其活動力已為淋菌所滅。女子自然不姙。故女子之患淋病。若不治愈。必致妨碍生育育。斷絕子嗣。其關係至鉅也。</p>
<p>女子於傳得淋菌。尙未深子宮入時。當以淋毒舒樂耳外治。即可將膣腔中淋菌完全殺凈。如侵入子宮。則可內服滅殺淋主治。淋菌自即滅殲。淋病亦即痊愈。必不致成為不姙症矣。</p>

<p>— 孫志耀醫生</p>
<p>癬為皮膚病之一。極易傳染。患者常時發時愈。若不得特效皮膚病藥品。極難根治。癬之來源。大都由於傳染。如醫生看護等人。因職業上之關係。手指常與病人皮膚接觸。亦易傳染。養尊處優之人。因皮膚缺乏抵抗力。亦易傳染。農夫頭面。被日晒雨淋。即易得在頭面之皮虜病。屠夫牧童等人。與畜類接觸。常有金錢癬。木匠鞋匠等則以胼胝終日。易生紅疹。或生濕疹。替水上生活者。以多得潮濕等氣。尤易生各種頑癬。</p>
<p>飲食與癬。亦有密切關係。喜飲酒之人。必多酒癬。多食辛辣食品者。尤生癬極易。</p>
<p>癬又有因氣候關係者。如濕熱帶之地。春秋二季。多流行濕疹與紅糖疹。冬季多牛皮癬。搔頑癬。夏日有皮癬。疹子。汗斑其餘尙有魚鱗癬。角皮癬等。則非惟傳染。且至傳代。</p>
<p>又癬與年齡。亦有變化。幼年所生之癬。多為色素等麻疹。魚鱗癬等。中年時則多兩跨陰癬脚趾癬等。老年人多生素斑癬。上皮癬等各以年齡而不同。</p>
<p>除此之外。頑癬一項。尙不計其類。但其原因。則不外乎傳染。以無論何種癬類。均為一種微菌侵入皮膚。如傳得微菌。立即生癬。因此奇能傳染。且以此種微菌。繫殖多。故根治困難。非將微菌殺凈。不能斷根。現在治療方法。以人工太陽燈與水銀石英燈照射。有驚人之特效。外用之藥。以斷體尼蔭路仁壽西藥社經售之潔絕菌為第一。能治各種頑癬。有藥到癬除之功。</p>

<p>— 崔仲彬醫師</p>
<p>胃臟疾病。不限於胃的一端。因有許多症候。關於胃臟。都可以發生胃痛。不祇限於胃的疼痛。但是患胃痛病。以胃疾為多。胃潰瘍和十二指腸潰瘍的胃痛。同飲食極有關係。在飢餓時候發痛。一吃相當的食物。痛便可以稍稍停止。而且時痛時愈。除痛之外。常有嘔血。吐酸。大便黑色等病狀。這種臟病。最為普遍。患的人也最多。</p>
<p>有一種胃痛。是由於神經衰弱而起。是一種神經性胃痛。胃臟內並沒有潰瘍。痛的時候。十分利害。這亦是胃臟病的一種。胃癌也是胃臟病的一種。乃是胃中生癌患者十分難治。有生命危險。但是發現得早。也不是絕症。不能醫治。胃臟病的發生胃痛。大都是有連續性的。餓的時候痛。飽的時候也痛。有時胃部。可以摸到一個硬塊。這個胃病。最為危險。</p>
<p>其餘膽囊炎。急性胃臟急炎等病。也常發生胃痛。不過痛的地位和形狀各各不同罷了。</p>

<h3 id="c225">羅素氏殆為一弱肉强食主義者乎？ <a href="#c225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>巴黎十九日國民電：世界聞名之政治社會經濟哲學家羅素氏，今日告美聯社記者，美國不能避免牽入歐洲方面任何戰事之漩過，並謂余甚贊許美國急謀中立之政策，惟戰爭一起，余不信此項擘劃能奏效，例如上次大戰，美國初亦力謀嚴守中立，然並無效果，蓋有經濟因素足使美國難於置身事外也，意國今日之所為，固屬頑惡，英國之所為，亦甚愚蠢，英國實不應如此强硬反對意國，吾人必須估量事實，應知阿比西尼亞若視歐洲及全世界，則並不見其重要，萬一戰事蔓延，歐洲及全世界，均有波及之慮，為世界着想，似應勉為其難，如屬必要，亦當不惜犧牲阿比西尼亞也。</p>
<p>意阿問題相持至現階段，已臨於一個量危險的關頭，眼見墨索里尼對於國聯行政院五國委貝會所提出的建議，未必肯放接受，而蓄意貫澈其征服阿比西尼亞的初志。故東菲風雲，除非是阿王屈伏，恐無澄淸的希望。關於這事，這里暫且擱起不談。惟我們覺得意阿爭端發生後，世界各國，大都不直意大利的橫蠻逞强，而同情阿國。尤以一班弱小民族，更為阿國抱不平，給阿國以不少精神上的援助獨稱為一代大思想家大學者的羅素氏，竟發出如是的論調，眞呌人不敢相信世界還有什麼道義和公理的存在。羅素氏殆為一弱肉强食主義者乎？</p>
<p>按羅素氏的主張，目的無非在避免戰事的擴大，存心末必不善，自然的，我們一估量事實，阿比西尼亞之視歐洲及全世界，其不重要，實顯而易見。英國如這樣强硬反對意國，萬一戰事蔓延，歐洲及全世界，均有波及之慮。故為世界安全着想，不但應勉為其難，至不得已時，亦當不惜犧牲阿比西尼亞。蓋犧牲阿比西尼亞，只是犧性一不重要的國家。若任戰事擴大，於世界大局，則有重大的影響。解决意阿問題，這算是最直截爽快，比三國會議和國聯會議所擬的方案，還要聰明而易行，墨索里尼聞之，必引羅素氏為同志，拍案大呌一聲，實待我心。然而世界弱小民族，今後將無生存的餘地矣。</p>
<p>我們以為消弭世界的糾紛，最好的方法，在制止强者的侵略行為。若一味以犧牲弱國為能事，反足以引起更大的紛亂。蓋國際事件的發生，大部分都導源於强者向弱奢尋　。沒有强者壓迫弱者，平靜的世界，是少會掀動波瀾的。這事實無論誰亦看得根淸楚。卽如今日的意阿爭端，這是如何發生的呢？是意大利的無理，還是阿比西尼亞的不是？這一問題的解决，犧牲阿國，誠然可以滿足意大利的要求，暫時不至牽動全局。可是將來的世界，將無公理之可言。那個有强權，那個便得以橫行天下。弱小民族只配為俎上肉，任人宰割。這一來，試問世界和平，將如何維持呢？這恐怕亦非大思想家大學者的羅素氏所能解答出來的吧。</p>
<h3 id="c226">生日 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 斯全</p>
<p>早上起身，寫字台上的紫泥花瓶中，揷着一束盛放的紫紅的大麗花，台上那些零亂的報章雜誌，都收拾整齊乾凈了。九月的溫柔的陽光剛從窗紗中射進來照在寫字台，平時像貓窩一樣使人見了就要頭痛的這小小書桌，今天是顯得那樣色彩調和，美麗可親。</p>
<p>我很愛好花草，到上海來後，一則自己的工作太忙，沒有餘閒來幹這種旁觀者看來是風雅的事，而且在寸金地的狹小的樓中實在沒有種花的地位了。不過平時走過花店，不時購一束來點綴點綴而已。我還有種怪癖，我不愛香味濃厚的花朶，最好是色素鮮艷而略有芬芳的淸味，特別愛好大的花就是這個原因。</p>
<p>最近預備搬家，是為了職業的關係，於是懶性大發，不要說寫字台零亂不堪，房裏的每一個角落都是東包西紮，但是我從那紫泥花瓶上收回視綫來的時侯，房裏今天也收拾得淸楚一點。這或許是妻看不過那種骯髒的情形，而發狠花費一點時間的，我想。</p>
<p>妻聽見我起床，從樓下上來了。她先裝着憤怒的樣子說：「懶蟲，一到搬家的前幾天，總是弄得像猪欄一樣，有個朋友來成什麼樣子。」她見我呆着不動手漱洗，轉換了笑聲說：「快洗了面，去約幾個朋友來吃麵。」</p>
<p>「幹麼？」我很驚奇，昨天晚上妻還告訴我這次搬家費都沒有着落，今天何以闊氣起來要請客呢？</p>
<p>「今天是你生日啊！三十歲了，自己的生日都不知道！</p>
<p>我聽了本來想笑，但是見妻那樣興奮的樣子，為了我的三十歲的生日，她忙了一早晨收拾房間，整理寫字台，並且她記着去年今天幾個朋友們高興大家到我家里來吃麵。他們說上海人是做九的，就算向你祝壽罷。我沒有那種高興，但是吃一頓麵也沒有什麼關係，　牠二十九歲三十歲。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>妻却以爲卅歲是個整生臼，去年邀了朋友來吃麵，今年反冷淸淸算什麼，爲了不忍拂了她的盛意，我倒底出去邀了幾個朋友來，大家快快活活過了一天</p>
<p>撒謊一個理由，我吿了一天假，算是做三十歲生日。現在已是午夜了，萬籟俱寂，坐在寫字台前我注視着那束大麗花，覺得一個女子的愛她丈夫是無微不至的，一個人的生日在她們心目中是一個了不得的日子。其實活到三十歲四十歲，不過紀錄一個人到世上來的時間罷了，有什麼値得紀念的？我對於生日從來就不記在腦子裏，雖然小時候可以穿一天新衣服而牢牢記着自家是什麼日子生的。現在是家的重擔壓在自家的肩頭上了，每天在預算着生活費的安排，自己倒底活了多少日子，如其想起來時實在是個悽痛的回憶呵！然而是三十歲了，照普通的人壽計算，我僅僅活到了一半，將來的一半還是那麼多的生日要過，但是怎樣去打發每一個接末的日子呢？恐怕像那大麗花一樣，今天牠雖然欣榮地放着鮮艷的花朵，不過這個紫泥花瓶是立刻要殺害了牠的生命的，或許在我沒有搬家之前，牠已被棄在垃圾箱畔，人類的生命未始不是這樣的渺茫。那末，牢記着自己的生日幹嗎呢？</p>
<h3 id="c227">故鄉 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 江大</p>
<p>大街</p>
<p>經過了一次戰爭和連年的災禍，大街顯然是沒有一點生氣的衰落了。在幾年前回鄉的時候，這里還是全城一條很熱鬧的市街，開店的人終日很忙碌的在做着他們的買賣，上鄕的下鄉的，誰不是帶着一擔擔地或者是一籃籃地東西，行人就好似螞蟻一樣擁滿着一條狹小的路上，從天一亮到上燈，幾乎沒有一刻靜息過。可是現在，畢竟是變了樣了，就連從前算最熱　的早晨，也只有寥寥地幾個人在走動着，到了午後，那就靜得連一條餓狗走過的聲音都覺得格外的響；商店的門板，也都沾上了一　很厚很厚的灰泥，好似是幾年沒有動過了。擺有架子上的東西，也像是賣不掉的陳貨蓋上了滿面的灰塵，做生意的人，沒精打彩的在打瞌睡。這一切都顯現出大街是完全的不同了，也許這在故鄕的人是看過不知多少時候，覺得很平常了。可是我這幾年沒有歸鄉的人，倒覺得驚奇了，雖然在未回到故鄉的途中，文弟已經吿訴過我：「故鄉已經不是早日的故鄉了。」</p>
<p>關帝廟前</p>
<p>從大街一直的走到盡頭，就是全城裏算是最顯靈的關帝爺的廟宇，這在我兒時它就給我一個很深的印象，因爲這是全城的一個最熱鬧最好玩的好去處，在這裏有着賭「魚蝦蟹」的，「十二字」的，「四色」的，還有唱戲，有說書，有走江湖的變戲法的，有賣拳打武的，一切的玩意兒都在這裏雲集着，由於玩的把戲多，人也就熱鬧起來了，做生意的姑娘們，夜裏也會在這裏走動着，所以只要到過我的故鄉的人，幾乎都要到過關帝廟前玩玩。像這樣一個好去處，在我兒時就天天在那裏玩了，所以，雖到現在已經是隔了很多年，但腦子裏還記憶得很淸楚。尤其是到了過年過節的時候，更是顯得格外的擁擠，做生意的都在這裏擺下了攤子，城裏的，鄉間的，一羣羣地男男女女就到這裏來進香，廟祝每年的這幾次收入，也就不少了，所以每次碰到那個老廟祝，他總是笑迷迷地。但是現在呈現在我的眼前的這座關帝廟，已經是變過了樣子了。從前廟前的屋頂和兩扇火門，是刷得紅裏加金的耀眼，牆壁是雪白的亮，座裏的紅臉關爺是每年加上金粉和穿上大紅袍，座前的　座石香爐裹終　　　出　濃烟。　　切，都沒有了，廟前的屋角還存留着子彈穿過的小洞，兩扇大門也沒有了，牆壁是給雨水漏得一片片地大黑跡，三座石香爐都缺了口的佈上蜘蛛網，座里的關爺好似衰老了些臉上蒙着一層灰黑色，眼前的一切都與往昔不同了。照壁下從前蓋着白布幕的賭攤，現在只剩下了很寥落的舖在地上的幾攤了，賭的人，也只是幾個穿着短褲的或是破舊的長衫的，不過「十二字」變做「番攤」吧了。而且在人羣裏我發現了從前是一個很老實而且很安份守己的吳厝埕的老吳，他在雜在攤前指東劃西的說着賭經，他的佈滿縐紋的臉，突然的現出一些紅色來，他走近我的身邊問了幾時回來之後，很不好意思般的低下頭說聲「今晚再去看你」很快的就走了。</p>
<p>故鄉，兒時的故鄉，黃金時代的故鄉，一切已經過去了，呈現在眼前的是這末一幅荒凉的古城呀！</p>
<h3 id="c228">蚊蟲 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 耳禾</p>
<p>年來投入了都市的懷抱我只感到臭蟲的苦惱而忘記了蚊蟲的兇惡。這回從火熱的舊　六月返鄉後　　　　　的　留我直到過了慘淡的中秋纔重來滬上，然而我已深深地感到蚊蟲的可恨了。莊子天運篇謂「蚊蟲嗜屑，則通夕不寐矣」。這痛苦，我也切身地經騐到了。</p>
<p>這灰色，長脚的小東西我是想不到會那麼兇惡的。雖然蚊蟲之有並不是從現在始，但我的感覺總有些橡九斤太太，感到現在的蚊蟲同從前的蚊蟲確有不同的地方。我淸楚地記得從前的蚊蟲是獃頭獃腦的，殺牠十隻二十隻是極容易的事情，而現在蚊蟲的感覺似乎特別敏銳了，等到我覺着痛想殺死牠時，而牠早已揚長而去，這，或許是我的老邁的綠故吧。</p>
<p>今年，鄉下的收獲並不壞，而蚊蟲特別多，這恰恰合上了鄉下老少皆知的一句話「蒼荒蚊熟」。這是說蒼蠅多是荒年，蚊蟲多是熟年，而今年的鄕下蒼蠅特別少，幾乎是絕無僅有。這雖然無所根據，但「蒼荒蚊熟」這句活的可應用於今年倒確是事實。然而就此苦了我，實在，爲了蚊蟲我所受的苦已够了。</p>
<p>古書云：「蠅成市於朝，蚊　甫於　　。的　，晚上的蚊蟲是特別多的，聲勢浩浩，確有稱「市」之槪。自家幽居在一間並不十分大也並不十分小的屋子裏，終朝在籐椅上流着汗，不看書當然可以，偏偏蚊蟲吵擾着我，使我連安靜地幻想一刻的機會也沒有，這頗使我悲哀的。不得已，只得躱到帳子裏邊去因爲得了片刻的寗靜我倒把四年前的幻想想起來了。那時我設想着我是一隻蚊子，我可以闖進繡闥，偷入羅帷，去吸吮漂亮小姐的血，卽或被殺死，倒也可以說是「殉情」。但現在心情畢竟是老了，這些想入非非的幻想已捉不住我！我感到囚人那樣的痛苦，流着汗揭開帳門還是躺到籐椅上去。但蚊蟲還是不放鬆我，假若在從前我是會想種種報復方法的。我曾苦心地一次殺死過三百多隻的蚊子。那是一個夏夜，爲了太疲憊很早我便入睡了，那知不小心把帳門推開了，於是有四五隻蚊子來光顧我了，爲了疲憊我不管他，那知愈來愈多，無諭怎樣難於入夢了，我淸醒，我决心想把蚊子殺一個痛快，於是索性把帳門推開，一邊　着　處，一，邊靜靜兒等待大　蚊子進來，最後重把　門收緊，點起　　燈耐着性去燙，是役也，計殺斃蚊子三百多隻，無一幸免者。我戚到勝利，熄了燈，便呼呼入睡了。但在現在我是無心和蚊子計較了，有時倒像書獃子那樣呆看着吃砲血的蚊子像拖着「紅燈籠」，笨重地飛不起來，也有輕快得像燕子那樣一上一下地飛的，於是哼着：「飽去櫻桃重，饑來柳絮輕」。連痛苦也忘掉了。</p>
<p>我的所以不殺蚊蟲，並不是想學晋時孝子吳猛那樣，夏時手不驅蚊，懼其去己而噬親，我實在懶得不能動顫。但畢竟有切膚之痛，有時也出其不意的殺牠兩三隻。想起孟東野的「但將膏血求，覺覺性命輕」之句，我深深地悲痛着蚊蟲了。</p>
<p>中秋前後蚊蟲大槪爲了死期將臨的緣故吧，特別不放鬆我，特別苦得我厲害。如今又飄到都市來，照過去情形來推測三四年內我也許不會返鄉。草此蕪文，　倒帶着幾分感傷性的。</p>

<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>（一）秋雨</p>
<p>秋，在北國是雨的季節。</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>我獨自一個人住在這荒僻的山邨裏，日子本來已是長得難以消磨的了，要是還遇到雨天，那種無聊就更加難以想像了。</p>
<p>當夜裏臨睡的時候，我總要推開窗兒，看一看天上有沒有璀燦的星斗。我是那樣子害怕雨天，一看到天上地上溶成一片無垠的黑暗，我心裏就陰沉起來，害怕明天是個雨天。這樣我有幾次在夢里竟作了在山抝裏過見了大雨的夢來</p>
<p>一早醒來，望着窗外的天星蔚藍的一片，澄碧得像皇宮裏的碧玉，太陽又似一隻柔軟的觸手，溫和地撫摸着對過那面高牆時，我便愉快地跳下床來，拿着那支手杖走到山坡上去，看看那罩在輕紗裏的秋的林野。但秋是北國多雨的季節，它給我這病人沒有多少晴天，不是濃陰，便是細雨。</p>
<p>有一回竟接連下了將近十天的雨。山居唯一的消遣本來只有散步，但山路滿是黃泥，就是雨後亦滑得難以下脚。於是我只得成天獃在屋子裏，悄默地看着透過屋頂小茅草滴下來的雨漏，看看那雨漏落在地上濺起來的小水花。不然就靠着那潮濕的窗沿，看水畔蘆葦在風雨中的飲泣與私語，或斜坡上傾注而下的一股股的小水流，以及那罩在濃烟裏的模糊的山野。這時候我的心情是悒鬱的。我亦時常想到這潮濕的空氣多麼摧殘了我這有病人的健康。（未完）</p>

<p>鄉愁曲</p>
<p>大地茫茫，那襄是我的故鄕？眼前是酒綠燈紅，悠揚的音樂在耳邊響！心兒沉醉，人兒輕狂，小姐們巧笑佯嗔，紳士們淺斟低唱；看不見國家的滄桑，聽不見大衆的嗟傷。輕歌妙舞夜未央，夜未央，好一片太平的景象！大地茫茫，那里是我的故鄉？悵金那遙遠的北方，　繡的山河已淪亡！遍地哀鴻，滿限創傷，敵人的撿砲震天響，同胞的血染荒塲，毀滅了城市和村莊，離散了兒女和爺娘！天南地北在流浪，在流浪，那里是我們的家鄉？</p>

<p>『夜來香是由程步高編導，開拍至今，巳有一年多了。其中因胡蝶女士去國，曾停拍過數月，現胡蝶歸國，——在日夜的緊張工作中，全部工竣，獻於社會人士之前了。該片是一個戀愛的悲劇，悲劇的主翁，一個是賣花女郎胡蝶，一個是少年工人趙丹，而另一個是村女舒繡文，形成一個三角戀愛——趙丹熱戀着胡蝶，而舒繡文却單戀着趙丹，後來胡蝶被大少孫敏誘去了。趙丹失戀，於是一怒而毅然與舒繡文結婚了。結果，胡蝶終被大少爺孫敏遺棄，舒繡文不幸犧牲在亂戰的砲火中，趙丹還是爲胡蝶而犧牲了自己的生命。現在抄一段導演　步高談關於劇本的話：「夜來香」這劇本在六七年前，就曾和陳君壽蔭計畫着了，前年我又和黃君子布商　過，一直到去年，舊事重提，找新才料，經好友之熱心帮助，才成此劇。</p>
<p>導演</p>
<p>道演程步高，在中國是有着悠久的歷史和不少的貢獻的，「春　」與「狂流」的公映，替中國電影劃分了一個時代，將沉落在鴛鴦胡蝶氣息中的中國電影，挽救起來，而踏上一個新的路綫。「夜來香」，這是他六七年來的心血結晶，因爲在「狂流」「春蠶」公映的時候，他就有着開拍這部片子的計盡了，可以這樣說，「夜來香」是他繼「狂流」「春蠶」後的力作。</p>
<p>演員</p>
<p>胡蝶：不用說，她的演技是到了爈火純靑的一步的，無論演那種個性的角色，都能恰到好處。「姊妹花」的公映，　顯示了她演技的能力與天才，在同一個塲面中，她刻劃出貧與富兩個不同階級的典型來，「大寳」窮酸的表情，「寳」豪華的氣慨，大約的深印在觀衆的腦膜中吧？「夜來香」，這是她歐游的紀念作品，當然，這也是她特別用心演戲的作品。</p>
<p>趙丹：是一個天才的演藝家，雖然他從舞台而跨上銀幕的歷史還不久，主演的片子也不多，然而他的大名，已傳遍整個的中國影壇了。他在銀幕上所飾演的角色，常常是很感傷的。這次在「夜來香」裏，他還是做了一個很神經質的人，但這兒不是他一向所慣飾的知識份子，而是一個富於熱情的農家少年。無疑的，他將有一種新的姿態獻在我們的眼前了。</p>
<p>孫敏：是演輕薄的闊少年而見長的，我們知道做「反派」的戲，要比做「正派」的確，原因做「反派」的戲，他的舉動，他的態度，幾乎都是惹人反感的，演戲的人，也常常容易把「輕薄」和狡獪，「浮滑」和「陰險」……等等混亂，分不淸楚，而「正派」角色，編劇先生常常替他安排了許多引人同情的情節，演來自然容易博得覜衆的好感。孫敏這次在「夜來香」中，還是演一個輕薄的少年，在銀幕上的那種。「狡獪」的舉動，幾乎與他自己判若兩人了，認識他的朋友們，都不相信那「夜來香」中浮滑的壞蛋，就是馴良的孫敏，據看過「夜來香」試汽的人們講，孫　敏在這兒是比他以往主演的形片成功得多了。</p>
<p>舒繡文：也是和趙丹一樣，從舞台跨上銀幕的一個善演戲的演員，她的戲也演得不多，可是我們可以充分地看出她的天才來，在「熱血忠魂」中，她所飾的秋瑾一角，那種前淸革命靑年對於滿淸不滿的表情，態度，以及秋瑾的個性，她都淸楚地表現了出來，令人有一種充分的遲實感。在「夜來香」中，他飾一烟刻薄的大姐，單戀着趙丹嫉妒着胡蝶，想盡方法來破壞她的情敵。當她發現胡蝶與孫敏有勾搭的時候，馬上就去吿訴胡蝶的爸爸跟趙丹，使得他們都得氣憤，她一方面狡狗地激怒胡蝶的爸爸，一方面叉安慰梅生。以她那聰明的人，來演這種聰明個性的戲，好的成績，是意枓中事了。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Chiang's Suppression of Communists Nearing Completion; Japanese Dispatch's Claim of Tacit Understanding Inaccurate; "Tolerating Communists" Policy Even More of a Baseless Rumor; Third International Resolution Already Protested Orally by Me <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Yesterday, a Japanese newspaper in Shanghai, based on a Tokyo dispatch from the Japan United Press, published several bizarre pieces of news, including claims that Chairman Chiang had reached a tacit understanding regarding the suppression of the Communist forces; that among important figures in the Nanjing government and the Nationalist Party, some openly advocated allowing Soviet influence to enter and exit the country in order to counter Japanese influence; and that China had originally intended to protest the resolution of the Third International Congress, following Japan and the United States, but had suddenly ceased these plans. The above points are not only bizarre and sudden but also imbued with the implication of provoking Sino-Japanese sentiments. At a time when both China and Japan are seeking goodwill with each other, it is regrettable and shocking that such strange news comes from the Jiji Press Agency, known for its quick communication. Regarding the military situation of bandit suppression in Sichuan, the central news agency personnel dispatched to follow the bandit suppression authorities recently returned from an inspection of Sichuan, and the true situation is now extremely clear. Ever since the Zhu-Mao faction broke through in Jiangxi and fled through Hunan, Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan, eventually infiltrating Sichuan, Chairman Chiang has dispatched capable troops from the beginning to track and suppress them without any let-up. Chairman Chiang himself also did not shy away from hardship and fatigue, personally going to the provinces of Sichuan, Yunnan, and Guizhou to oversee the suppression. When Chairman Chiang defeated Zhu-Mao in Yunnan and Guizhou, the remaining bandit forces were extremely weak. However, due to the cunning of Zhu-Mao, the assistance of the Xu bandits in Sichuan, and the geographically difficult terrain, the Zhu-Xu factions ultimately managed to unite. Chairman Chiang was extremely angered by this and severely punished the generals who were responsible. After that, in addition to reorganizing the Sichuan army's lineup and readjusting the front lines, he also continuously dispatched a large number of central troops to Sichuan to jointly suppress the bandits. The national armies of Gansu and Qinghai also moved out at the same time. However, the strategy to thoroughly eliminate the Red bandits was only one of encirclement and blockade. Therefore, Chairman Chiang continued to adopt this stable strategy in Sichuan. However, the geographical difficulty of Sichuan is far greater than that of Jiangxi. The Songli Mao area is full of towering mountains and snow that is knee-deep all year round, making combat extremely difficult. However, the national army, out of deep hatred for the Red bandits, continues to bravely advance. Currently, the remaining Zhu-Xu bandits are showing signs of collapse and disintegration and will soon be eliminated. Chairman Chiang's eight years of enduring hardship and stabilizing the country's great achievements can also be completed. To say that he would at this time reach a tacit understanding with the remaining bandits who are like fish out of water is nothing short of delusional. Regarding the point about a policy of tolerating Communists, it is even more of a baseless rumor. Since the purge of the Party in the sixteenth year (1927), the central government has always adopted a policy of actively eliminating the Communist Party, which destroys the organization of our Party and endangers national security. Not only are there obvious facts in the military field that are visible to the world, but also in the ideological field, the suppression and prohibition of literature promoting communism is probably even stricter and more effective than in Japan. In addition, the repeated cracking down on Communist Parties secretly plotting in the concession area, dealing them the greatest blows, is also clearly evident. Therefore, to say that the central government has adopted a policy of tolerating Communists is undoubtedly absurd. As for the claim that a certain member strongly advocated tolerating the Communists when the Central Standing Committee discussed the postponement of the Sixth Plenary Session, reporters have inquired with all members of the Central Committee, who have all said that no such thing occurred. Regarding the resolution of the Third International Congress, according to reporters' inquiries with diplomatic authorities, it is said that an oral protest has already been lodged with the Soviet Russian side.

<p>(Beiping) Doihara, head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Shenyang, flew to Zhangjiakou on the 25th and stayed overnight. Originally scheduled to return to Shenyang via Beiping, according to a telegraphic message received from the Chahar area, Doihara's trip to Beiping was temporarily cancelled, and he returned directly to Shenyang this morning. Takahashi, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy who flew to Zhangjiakou to welcome him yesterday, returned to Beiping on this morning's Ping-Sui train. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Doihara and Tanaka Hisashi, the head of the Japanese Special Service Agency in Chengde, flew to Zhangjiakou on the 25th. Takahashi, the military attache of the Japanese Embassy, also flew to Zhangjiakou on the 25th to meet them. Qin Dechun and Xiao Zhenying held a banquet at the Provincial Government that evening, accompanied by Chen Juesheng, the chief advisor to the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters. Xiao Zhenying and Chen Juesheng arrived in Beiping today. Xiao stated that his trip to Zhangjiakou was of an inspection nature and without any mission. He entertained Doihara, head of the Shenyang Special Service Agency, on the 25th, but they did not discuss any issues. Doihara's trip to Zhangjiakou was to inspect the situation of the Special Service Agency there. He flew back to Chengde by plane at 9 a.m. this morning. Qin Dechun originally intended to inspect various counties but found it difficult to do so because of pending provincial affairs. Qin is scheduled to come to Beiping at the end of this month.

<h3 id="e3">He Yingqin Will Not Go to Japan to Observe Military Exercises; Did Not Entrust Li Zeyi to Negotiate Any Matters <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Shanghai Nichi Nichi Shimbun (Japanese newspaper) published on the 24th of this month that one of the purposes of Li Zeyi's trip to Japan was to seek the Japanese government's understanding of He Yingqin's trip to Japan. Regarding this matter, a reporter from the Central News Agency paid a special visit to Minister He on the morning of the 26th to inquire about the truth. Minister He replied, "I had absolutely no knowledge of Li Zeyi's trip to Japan, either before or after, and I certainly did not ask Li to negotiate any matters with the Japanese government." It was also heard that Minister He was very surprised after seeing this news in the Japanese newspaper and telegraphed Li to inquire whether he had made such remarks. Yesterday, he received a reply from Li, stating that the newspaper reports were entirely unfounded. However, on the day of Li's departure for the East, various newspapers reported that I would be going to Japan to observe military exercises. The telegram came from the special correspondent of the Japanese newspaper stationed in Nanjing. Some Japanese journalists asked Zeyi about it, but he replied that he had not received any news from the country and could not answer clearly. There was no mention of any activities beyond that. Judging from this, the various points reported by the Japanese newspaper may be conjectures. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the news that He Yingqin would go to Japan to observe military exercises, according to inquiries from those around He, it is said that the Japanese military exercise this time is purely based on new weapons and new tactics, and the scale is grand, which is worthy of our observation. In mid-month, Japanese military attache Amamiya and his assistant, stationed in Nanjing, informally expressed to us in their personal capacity that they would like to invite our dignitaries to visit. For the sake of mutual learning, He originally planned to visit Japan. It is now known that the exercise period is from November 7 to 13, which coincides with the Sixth Plenary Session and the Fifth Plenary Session, making it impossible for him to be present. Therefore, this trip was cancelled. It is also heard that this matter was entirely a private exchange of views between those around He and military attache Amamiya. There has been no contact with any other parties, and the rumor that someone was sent to the East to prepare is absolutely untrue. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian arrived in Nanjing by train at 8 a.m. on the 26th. After entering the city, he visited friends in Nanjing and met with Huang Musong to discuss mediation methods for the West Gongqi dispute. He also plans to visit President Wang in the coming days to report everything. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian arrived in Nanjing on the morning of the 26th to discuss the West Gongqi dispute, which is being mediated by Oqirga. Oqirga has arrived in Bailingmiao to meet with Prince Yun. The rumor that Prince Yun prevented Oqirga from going to Prince Shi's place is untrue. Going to Bailingmiao was en route to Baotou, and Baotou is very close to West Gongqi, so he had to pass through there first. The rumor that both sides had mobilized troops for contact is also untrue. Although the emotions of both sides were triggered by Shi's dismissal, it has not reached the point of either side taking extreme measures. When I was in Beiping, I met with many Mongolians, most of whom were able to abandon their prejudices and agree with the central government's fair handling of the situation, seeking a peaceful and applicable solution to avoid prolonging the situation and creating new problems. The central government is investigating the truth and has ordered the governments of Chahar and Suiyuan provinces to eliminate the estrangement between the two sides nearby. The Mongolian Political Affairs Committee is scheduled to hold its anniversary celebration on the 9th of next month and a general meeting on the 10th. All members will attend, and this dispute will also be brought up for discussion. I will visit President Wang and Chairman Huang today and tomorrow to report in detail and convey the opinions of the Mongolian people living in Beiping. In short, this matter will soon be resolved in a fair manner and will never be expanded. Director Yan Xishan, because the Red bandits in northern Shaanxi are rampant, it is not a problem to eliminate them, but the villages and houses have been destroyed by the war. In order to completely eliminate the scattered organizations of the Red bandits and stabilize social order, I have researched the land policy and formulated a concrete plan, advocating that all land should be owned by the village. I have submitted it to the central government agencies and asked scholars across the country to express their opinions and discuss together whether it is suitable for the current situation in our country, as a reference for improving the land problem. I have several proposals for the Sixth Plenary Session, which will be sent to the Central Secretariat soon, focusing on contributing to the major plans of the party and the country. As for the land plan, I am not prepared to submit it at this session. Since Shanxi Province issued local currency substitute coupons, the results have not been significant, but it has guided the people of the entire province to embark on the path of promotion. As for trade between Shanxi and Zhejiang provinces, it is currently a local exchange of silk, and if it proceeds smoothly in the future, it will gradually expand. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Mongolian Political Affairs Committee initiated the proposal to dismiss Prince Shi of West Gongqi, the Zasaks of all leagues and banners in Inner Mongolia have felt that the hereditary system will lose its protection, and they jointly telegraphed the central government yesterday, requesting it to reiterate the explicit order to protect the old system. (Central News Agency dispatch, 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Oqirga, deputy director of the Mongolian-Tibetan Affairs Committee's office in Beiping, who is mediating the West Gongqi dispute, telegraphed from Bailingmiao yesterday, reporting that due to the lack of results in the mediation, he has decided to leave the temple this morning to pass through Suiyuan and come to Beiping, and will go to Nanjing to report after a week. According to Bao Yueqing, the Mongolian side hopes that the central government will quickly send a senior official to mediate. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>

After returning to Xuzhou, he telegraphed the provincial government and the Grand Canal Flood Control District to quickly block the breach, so as to obtain the planting of two crops of wheat and protect the cultural institutions. The county seat of Pi County is still surrounded by the Yellow River. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e15">Situation of the Breach on the North Liutang River <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Today, I visited a disaster victim surnamed Qian from Liuyang and inquired about the situation of the breach in Qianwei on the north bank of the North Liutang River as follows: According to the map, the Liutang River divides into two channels, north and south, east of Qianji. The south channel is wide, with a large flood discharge, while the north channel is narrow, with a small flood discharge. There is a Biandan River in the middle of the two rivers to regulate the water of the north and south Liutang Rivers. The dredging of the Liutang River last year was complained about by the people of Xiajiatan, resulting in the loss of its regulatory effect. There is also the Chaimi River downstream of the Qianwei breach, forming an acute angle with the North Liutang River, with Qianwei as the inner apex angle. The Chaimi River has no south embankment, so when the Yellow River roared into the Liutang River, the water in the south river was only half full, while the north river was already in a dangerous situation. Finally, the old embankment of Qianwei was broken in the morning of the 18th. For a time, the people retreated to the newly built remote embankment. It was unexpected that the water law was so sparse that it was washed away in many places on the 19th and 20th. As of now, people are already hoarse and exhausted, and the water is spreading and difficult to manage. It has merged with the south bank of the Chaimi River, and all places such as Xinjima, Machang, Tanggou, and Qianwei are more than five feet deep in water. Eight or nine out of ten houses have collapsed, and countless livestock have died, but fortunately no one has been injured. Furthermore, the Wan Gong River and the Kedang River on the north bank of the Chaimi River also reported seepage and breaches on the 25th, and the disaster area has expanded to Guanyun. He Zhengjiang, the magistrate of Donghai, has also retreated to his jurisdiction. (Special dispatch, 26th)</p>

The top of the dam has collapsed three or four feet, and various sweepings are being used to fill the gaps. Chen Guofu telegraphed to urge the blocking of the breach. The disaster in Pizhou and Shuyang is expanding, and materials for blocking the breach are being rushed to the construction site. According to the personnel of the breach blocking and transportation team, all the materials needed by the end of November can be transported to the breach and will not delay the closure before the ice flood.

<h3 id="e30">Reorganization of the American China Trading Company <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>— Yan</p>
<p>According to yesterday's report in the English-language *Ta Mei Wan Pao* (Greater American Evening Post), the American China Trading Company, following the United Theatres Corporation, the American-Oriental Banking Corporation, the American Eastern Trading Company, the Probst Realty Company, and the Probst Trust Company, is invoking a new law enacted in the United States due to the global economic downturn and petitioning the U.S. Court for China to allow reorganization and appoint a receiver to manage its assets. According to the company's newly appointed manager, Mr. Woodulfe, this move by the board of directors is intended to protect the interests of shareholders. As early as the beginning of March this year, the board was quite satisfied after investigating the company's financial situation. However, the current market is sluggish, and loans are difficult to recover, making it impossible to continue lending. Therefore, reorganization is the only way out. Bondholders have also been notified separately that all due interest on the company's 8% mortgage bonds and the due principal and interest on the 7% mortgage bonds will be temporarily suspended.</p>
<p>The American China Trading Company has been established for about 25-26 years. It was previously one of the most active players in the Shanghai real estate market, forming a near-equal triumvirate with the American Probst and the British Commercial Land Company. In past years, when Shanghai land prices soared, its annual profits were exceptionally high. The dividends received by shareholders were over 3% per week. Consequently, its stocks and bonds were closely watched by brokers in various trade associations. It developed rapidly over the years, and its capital was repeatedly increased, with bonds being issued continuously. In its current state, its paid-up capital is about 7 million yuan, and its bonds with solid guarantees are about 6 million yuan, while those without solid guarantees are about 10 million yuan. The company's total assets are about 55 million yuan. It is said that the liabilities are expected to offset the assets. However, according to our speculation, the company's book assets may be on par with its liabilities. However, with the current severe decline in real estate, it is doubtful whether the shareholders' interests can be protected and a final accounting has to be done.</p>
<p>Four or five years ago, the company's stocks and bonds were quite active in the market, and the stock price even exceeded double its value. Many foreign businessmen also invested in purchasing them in considerable numbers. Now that the company is under the custody of the U.S. Court for China and is beginning to reorganize, its future cannot be predicted. However, those who purchased them at high prices at the time may not be able to maintain their good value and avoid losses. The mistaken mentality of our people in blindly trusting foreign businesses in the past can now be awakened. Moreover, many Chinese who transferred their real estate deeds to American ownership had them registered through this company. They only hold a piece of paper as proof of ownership. After the reorganization, whether these Chinese deeds can be fully recovered is also a matter of concern for merchants who have dealings with the company.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held two meetings this morning and unanimously passed a proposal to form a thirteen-nation committee, consisting of all members of the Administrative Council except Italy, to report on the facts of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and make recommendations in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. The proposal was put forward by the Chairman of the Administrative Council and was initially established in a closed-door meeting, followed by a formal meeting for its passage. The Administrative Council also decided that the Five-Nation Special Committee should remain in existence to continue its mediation efforts in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant. Italian representative Aloisi did not attend either of this morning's meetings. The Thirteen-Nation Committee will hold its first meeting tomorrow. Representatives from Britain, France, Russia, Argentina, Spain, Australia, Turkey, Romania, Poland, Portugal, Denmark, Ecuador, and Chile will attend. It is noted that Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant stipulates that if the dispute cannot be resolved, the Administrative Council, by a unanimous or majority vote, shall issue a report stating the facts of the dispute and the recommendations that the Administrative Council considers fair and appropriate. (Reuters Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council, at its meeting this morning, decided to invoke Article 15 of the Covenant to deal with the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and to regard Italy as an aggressor. This action by the League of Nations is the result of Eden and Laval's urging yesterday that the League of Nations Administrative Council first invoke Article 15 and then implement Article 16 on sanctions. Representatives from thirteen nations attended the important meeting of the Administrative Council today. In just seventy minutes, they passed measures to apply sanctions to aggressors as stipulated in Article 15, Paragraphs 3 and 4 of the Covenant. The Italian representative was not present at the time. However, the representatives of the thirteen nations unanimously recognized that maintaining peace is the life of the League of Nations and that Italy could not be accommodated excessively. (National Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>Upon receiving the news from Geneva today that the League of Nations Administrative Council has decided to implement sanctions against Italy if Italy starts a war against Ethiopia, officials in Addis Ababa were extremely delighted.

<p>(Geneva) At this morning's formal public meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council, the Chairman of the Five-Nation Committee presented the Committee's report, recounting the course of seeking a peaceful resolution to the Italian-Ethiopian dispute. Although Ethiopian representative Haile Warat was not a member of the Administrative Council, he was invited by the Administrative Council and also attended this morning's meeting, stating that the Ethiopian delegation wished to reserve the right to consult with its government on any recommendations of the Administrative Council and that the Ethiopian government would give them extremely careful consideration.</p>
<p>The Chairman of the Administrative Council, Argentine representative Ginazu, stated that Article 15 of the Covenant had been in effect since the first meeting of the Administrative Council on September 4th. The next step is for the Administrative Council, in its capacity as a committee, to draft a report in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. As for the term of the Administrative Council, it will only end after the report of the Five-Nation Committee has been passed.</p>
<p>The Chairman's proposal was endorsed by British representative Eden, who stated that when the Thirteen-Nation Committee drafts the report, the governments of various countries will have the opportunity to consider within the scope of the Covenant whether a peaceful outcome can be achieved. Britain's policy has been stated responsibly, and Britain is determined to adhere to this policy. French Prime Minister Laval rose to support Eden's remarks, saying that France is willing to abide by the obligations under the Covenant to make recommendations and to carry out its duties in the spirit and letter of the Covenant, and is willing to present what it considers to be the fairest plan.</p>
<p>After the French Prime Minister spoke, Russian representative Litvinov rose to say that the Russian government was willing to support any resolutions made by the Administrative Council. Danish representative Munch stated that he also welcomed Chairman Ginazu's proposal to uphold the principles of the League of Nations. The Chairman's proposal was unanimously adopted by the whole meeting.</p>
<p>It is reported that at this morning's closed-door meeting, the representatives of Russia, Turkey, and Romania, while supporting the proposal of the Administrative Council, attached reservations to the acceptance of the report of the Five-Nation Committee, as it granted Italy too much power, which was inconsistent with the Covenant.</p>

<p>(Geneva) French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval, British Minister Without Portfolio Eden, Spanish representative and Chairman of the Five-Nation Subcommittee Madariaga, and League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol recently jointly discussed the procedures to be adopted at tomorrow's League of Nations Administrative Council meeting for an hour before completing the process. It is generally expected that at tomorrow's Administrative Council meeting, a drafting committee will be appointed to draft the final report on the Italian-Ethiopian dispute and include the recommendations of the Administrative Council. Furthermore, the memorandum submitted by Italy to the League of Nations Administrative Council has not been considered by the Five-Nation Subcommittee, but may be studied by the drafting committee later. League of Nations officials believe that if no serious incident occurs between Italy and Ethiopia in the short term, the League of Nations Administrative Council does not intend to act hastily. After the drafting committee is established, the Administrative Council will immediately announce its adjournment, and the subcommittee will then handle routine matters. If necessary, the subcommittee may convene a meeting of the Administrative Council within 24 hours. (Havas News Agency Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Today, according to the most authoritative sources here, British representative Eden and French Foreign Minister Laval have decided to request the League of Nations Administrative Council to proceed in accordance with Article 15 on Thursday to prepare for the implementation of Article 16 on sanctions against aggressor nations, and it is understood that other countries have also provisionally agreed to support the positions of Britain and France. It is also noted that the decision of the League of Nations Administrative Council this morning is not an innovation. The same procedure was also adopted in the cases of the dispute between Paraguay and Bolivia over the Gran Chaco and the dispute between China and Japan over Manchuria. Britain had also requested the invocation of Article 15 of the Covenant to deal with the Persian oil case, but the oil case was ultimately resolved through negotiations. This morning, the Administrative Council also decided that the work of the Five-Nation Committee should continue to be carried out in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 3 of the Covenant, which stipulates that the Administrative Council should make every effort to resolve the dispute. If effective, the facts and interpretations of the dispute and the terms of the resolution should be published as appropriate. (Reuters Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) As the thirteen members of the League of Nations Administrative Council, i.e., all members of the Administrative Council except Italy, discuss the recommendations under Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant, the overall situation seems to be temporarily calming down. The Administrative Council will strive to expedite everything, but with such a large group carrying out this work, it will not be as easy to achieve as the Five-Nation Special Committee, and it may have to wait for the Ethiopian government to submit a reply to the Italian government's accusations of atrocities by the Ethiopian authorities. Yesterday afternoon, the Presidium held an important meeting to discuss future procedures and decided whether the Presidium should suspend activities or elect a committee to represent all member states of the Administrative Council except Italy to draft recommendations for resolving the Italian-Ethiopian dispute in accordance with Article 15, Paragraph 4 of the Covenant. The Administrative Council will probably adjourn temporarily before the Committee presents its report, and the League of Nations General Assembly will also adjourn on Saturday. However, the Chairman of the General Assembly may convene a meeting at any time. There is a growing feeling that Mussolini is eager to find a "face-saving" way to withdraw his preparations for the East African war while still maintaining his position at home and internationally. (National Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Five-Nation Committee today announced the rejection of Italian representative Aloisi's "comments." Afterwards, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini called these "comments" informal in nature and therefore could not be rejected. The so-called "comments" included the following statements: "Italy considers Abyssinia a particularly dangerous enemy. Italy opposes the land adjustment proposals put forward by Britain and France, as these proposals would turn Abyssinia into a sea power and increase its danger to Italy." The "comments" also criticized the Five-Nation Committee for not allowing Italians to control the Ethiopian army. The Committee's report will be presented at the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting on Thursday. French Prime Minister Laval is still striving for peace, but is greatly disappointed given Mussolini's attitude. (National News Agency Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(London) The latest possibility in the Italian-Ethiopian situation is that Italy may demand that Abyssinia become its protectorate, but rumors that Mussolini intends to meet with French Prime Minister Laval in person to discuss this matter have now been denied by officials. The Italian newspapers expressed their views, saying that the issue of Italy's trusteeship over Abyssinia should be handled directly through negotiations between the two related countries. *Le Temps* in Paris stated that Italy wants to demand trusteeship based on Article 22 of the Covenant, as the Abyssinian people are a degenerate race. The newspaper added that it is difficult to predict how the League of Nations Administrative Council can approve this step, and it would be especially difficult for British public opinion to accept this solution. According to Article 22 of the Covenant, the right to protect degenerate races should be entrusted to advanced countries that have the resources, experience, or geographical capacity to assume this responsibility. On the eve of the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, France still hopes to have an opportunity for reconciliation before deciding to implement sanctions. According to well-informed French observers, there will be at least a ten-day period of hesitation to strive for a mutually agreeable solution. Assuming that the first step of the League of Nations Administrative Council is to organize a committee to draft proposals, as outlined in Article 15 of the Covenant, this committee may need ten days to review everything. (Reuters Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The efforts of British, French, and Italian diplomats to mediate the Italian-Ethiopian dispute have largely failed today. Britain insists on maintaining the independence of Abyssinia, but Mussolini refuses to make this a condition for negotiations. It was learned today that Italy may request the League of Nations General Assembly to redefine the trusteeship system. This motion will definitely be strongly opposed by Britain and France, as this motion would allow Germany and other countries hoping to overthrow the post-war borders to take the opportunity.

<p>(Rome) It is expected that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini will repeatedly postpone the date of the national Fascist trial total mobilization until there is concrete progress in Geneva. This mobilization was originally scheduled to take place today, but may be postponed until Saturday. It is said that after this trial is held, the Italian cabinet will meet to consider the latest developments in the situation. If the events in Geneva do not require Mussolini to issue his proclamation for national broadcasting, then the large-scale Fascist gathering may be postponed until next week. Officials are still skeptical about possible developments in Geneva, and public opinion in general is also becoming increasingly weary of the repeated delays in the situation. It is reported that the Italian representative will no longer attend the Geneva meetings attended by the Ethiopian representative. (Reuters News Agency Telegram on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Last night, a responsible spokesperson told a Reuters interviewer that Italy's attitude today is to wait quietly for the developments in Geneva tomorrow. "We deeply feel that the matter we are fighting for is well-founded, so we are determined to remain calm and composed, believing that the world will gradually support our claims. We have seen that those countries that opposed Italy's actions in East Africa are now gradually aware of our legitimacy." The spokesperson also said that the letter sent by British Foreign Secretary Hoare to Mussolini explaining the purpose of the British fleet's activities in the Mediterranean had a good influence on the Italians. The Italians now only hope that the attitude of the British representative in Geneva will be consistent with this. The Italians ridiculed the proposal to send a committee of neutral countries to Abyssinia to determine whether Abyssinia is currently taking offensive actions, saying that the border is very long.

<p>(Geneva) A French newspaper today still claimed that high-ranking figures in Italy are increasingly opposed to Mussolini's actions and published a report from its Geneva correspondent, stating that British diplomats expect that Prince Umberto of Italy may be likely to replace Mussolini as Prime Minister. At the same time, the French Communist Party's *L'Humanité* also claimed that the King of Italy is prepared to replace Mussolini with the famous aviator Balbo. *Le Figaro* in Paris claimed, "If Mussolini fails, then Fascism will collapse, and anarchy or communism will replace it." People here are paying close attention to this. (National Telegram on the 25th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Fair observers here claim that there is no evidence for the French newspapers' claim that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has gradually lost the people's faith at home. Mussolini's position in the hearts of the people and the King of Italy remains unshaken. However, the strictly controlled Italian newspapers are now showing signs of anxiety for the first time, and there is also deep unease here over Britain's stance of wanting to fulfill its responsibilities to the League of Nations on the one hand, while also wanting to safeguard Franco-Italian friendship on the other. The Italian people are increasingly weary of the fact that a solution to the Italian-Ethiopian dispute has not yet been achieved despite their daily expectations. However, it is said that the extent of the people's support for Mussolini himself has not been affected so far. Furthermore, the wording of the government's announcement today has also caused a great deal of speculation among officials and the public. The announcement stated that Mussolini had received British Ambassador Drummond, who conveyed a personal letter from British Foreign Secretary Hoare to the Prime Minister. Hoare spoke from the position of an old friend of Italy and said that he was extremely willing to dispel misunderstandings. Mussolini has now asked the British Ambassador to convey his gratitude. However, judging from the tone of the announcement, it is unclear whether what the British Ambassador conveyed was a reiteration of Britain's previous denial that the concentration of the fleet was hostile, or whether it referred to the misunderstandings of the Italian-Ethiopian dispute.

<h3 id="e36">Roosevelt Orders Publication of Embargoed Goods List, Including Six Types of Munitions, but Not Ammunition Raw Materials <a href="#e36" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c36" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">36</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt, acting under the recently passed Neutrality Act, today ordered the prohibition of the transport of weapons and munitions to any location outside the United States. The order includes a detailed list specifying various munitions such as tanks, armored vehicles, warships, military aircraft, poison gas, etc., all defined as "war supplies." Manufacturers and vendors dealing in these items must first obtain a license before selling or transporting them. The omission of raw materials from the list has aroused widespread speculation. If European countries impose sanctions on Italy, and American businesses continue to sell raw materials to the Italian government, what will be the result? According to the Neutrality Act, the effect of this ban lasts until the end of February next year, at which time Congress will likely pass permanent neutrality measures. (25th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has just released the list of military supplies for which export is prohibited, as drafted by the National Munitions Control Board. This list specifies the munitions that can be embargoed to belligerent nations in wartime, and includes six categories: (1) guns, machine guns, ammunition, and tanks; (2) all types of warships; (3) assembled or disassembled aircraft and other aerial vehicles equipped with machine guns or bombs; (4) pistols and automatic pistols weighing over 630 grams; (5) aircraft and airship engines; and (6) gas and incendiary projectile launchers. Manufacturers of these munitions who intend to export their products overseas, even at this time when there is no international war, must apply to the National Munitions Control Board for a license. The Board has no right to refuse to issue licenses at this time. Raw materials used to manufacture ammunition are not included in this list. Furthermore, manufacturers and dealers of munitions must register with the National Munitions Control Board starting from November 29th. Secretary of Commerce Roper recently stated to the press that the Munitions Control Board is currently studying which raw materials and products can be included in the embargo list. (25th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) The State Department, in order to implement the wartime Neutrality Act, previously appointed a committee to study and compile a list of the types of war supplies that should be prohibited from being transported to belligerent nations in wartime. The committee's research concluded that if this ban were implemented, U.S. exports would decrease by $5 million per month in wartime. (25th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Djibouti, Abyssinia, today closed its war zone, prohibiting foreigners from entering or exiting. This move indicates that Abyssinia believes that all parties are unable to prevent Italy from resorting to force. All routes of the Franco-Ethiopian Railway south to Ogaden and north to Danakil have been cut off by order of the Abyssinian government. Abyssinian troops in these two areas are now digging trenches under the guidance of military experts from Sweden and other countries, preparing to resist the Italian army's simultaneous attacks from Eritrea in the north and Walwal in the southeast. It is believed here that the Italian army plans to invade simultaneously from the north and south, and after meeting at the railway, join forces to directly attack the Abyssinian capital. The Abyssinian Emperor telegraphed from the capital today, reiterating his request to the League of Nations to send impartial observers to Abyssinia for investigation, but the preparations for war on both sides of the railway show that the Abyssinian Emperor no longer hopes that diplomatic means can avoid the war. A telegram from the Abyssinian capital today stated that five of the twenty male lions captured by the Abyssinian Emperor escaped from their cages, devoured one of the courtiers, and were subsequently shot dead by the machine guns of the Guards, avoiding chaos in the capital. (25th National News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>The Abyssinian Emperor today reiterated his desire for peace to the League of Nations, stating that in view of the continuous provocations and to avoid unexpected incidents, he has now ordered the frontline troops to withdraw thirty miles.

Rumors of an order for mobilization have recently been denied by the Abyssinian government. (25th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol received a telegram today personally signed by the Abyssinian Emperor, arguing that if any border incidents or invasions occur in the future, a neutral observer delegation should be sent to monitor everything. The telegram stated: "Months ago, in view of Italy's attitude, provocations became increasingly serious, and if there were hostile acts, invasion could not be avoided, so a special order was issued to withdraw troops along the border by twenty kilometers to avoid conflicts and allow Italy and Britain to take the opportunity to carry out aggression. This order has been fully complied with." The telegram also recounted the Abyssinian Emperor's previous request to send impartial observers to determine the responsibility for any intrusions or acts of aggression, and asked the League of Nations Council to prepare as soon as possible what it considered necessary. The Abyssinian Emperor also firmly stated that the Abyssinian government would fully cooperate with all plans decided by the League of Nations Council. The Abyssinian Emperor also suggested that the members of the delegation should travel by plane, and the cost could be borne by the Abyssinian government. (26th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This agency's reporter does not believe that the League of Nations will dispatch an investigation team to Abyssinia, as requested by the Abyssinian government, because dispatching an investigation team would make the current tense situation even more serious, and the geographical situation in the area where Abyssinia borders Italian colonies in East Africa is extremely complicated, and even if an investigation team is sent there, it would not be easy to fulfill its mission.

<p>(Geneva) British and French representatives attending the League of Nations Economic Committee reached a compromise today on France's plan for realistic currency stabilization. The French chief representative, Bonnet, has withdrawn his proposal and instead supported the more flexible plan proposed by the British representative, Burgin, namely, that both parties reach an agreement to reduce trade barriers and reserve room for exchange rate fluctuations. Burgin also stated that all governments want to restore the international gold standard, and this can only be achieved through reciprocal treaties. Adjustments can also be made if exchange rates differ too much. It is worth noting that US Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and several other Treasury officials are currently in Europe, and the agreement reached between Britain and France today is of great importance.

<p>(Nanjing) The Shanghai Daily News' report on the seafarer certification examination is inaccurate. The Ministry of Communications is disclosing the true situation of the seafarer certification examination as follows. The Ministry of Communications' seafarer certification examination is established to ensure navigation safety and fulfill the obligations of the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea. Both Japan and other countries have such a system. The Ministry of Communications' seafarer certification does not restrict nationality. All foreign nationals and Japanese residents in China who serve as seafarers are treated equally. There is no discrimination between Chinese and foreign seafarers. Since the promulgation of the certification regulations, a total of 617 seafarers have applied for the examination at the Ministry of Communications. 124 Chinese seafarers failed, 14 Western seafarers failed, and 11 Japanese seafarers failed. This fact can demonstrate that there is absolutely no intention of favoring one nationality over another in the certification of seafarers. The Ministry of Communications has repeatedly extended the deadline for this examination. Recently, due to the ship schedules of some seafarers, they were unable to take the examination within the time limit. The Ministry specially took into account the situation and extended the original deadline for cracking down on uncertified seafarers, which was set for September. It is now scheduled to hold another examination simultaneously at the Shanghai, Tianjin, and Hankou Shipping Administrations from October 16 to November 10 this year. All seafarers who have taken the examination but failed and those who have not yet taken the examination can register for the examination at the local shipping administrations before the end of this month. Both navigation safety issues and seafarer livelihood issues have been taken into consideration. (26th Dispatch)</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Nanchang City's Fire Prevention Week, from the 23rd to the 27th. At 7:30 a.m. on the 21st, the Citizens' Meeting and Fire Prevention Week Opening Ceremony were held at the Provincial Stadium. More than 10,000 people attended, including leading officials from party and government agencies, representatives from industry and commerce, and citizens. The representatives stood in formation according to their designated locations. Personnel from various agencies stood in a line in front of the rostrum. Various schools and groups were arranged in a circular shape. Various performances were held in the center of the field. The temporary buildings were set up. At 7:30, music was played to open the meeting, and the flag-raising ceremony was held. After the opening ceremony, the chairman gave a report, followed by a training speech by Inspector Miao Peicheng. Then the various fire prevention, firefighting, and rescue performances began. First, Limin Store demonstrated the effectiveness of fire extinguishing bombs. In advance, the store constructed a temporary house, which was ignited with planed wood and kerosene. Suddenly, the flames blazed, penetrating the roof. Then, fire extinguishing bombs were thrown in, but because the flames were too fierce, they did not work. After dozens more were thrown in, the fire was extinguished and then re-ignited. It was ineffective. The attendees were all dumbfounded. Later, the fire brigade injected water with a light water hose, and the fire was extinguished. Then, the Zhendan fire extinguisher performed. Planed wood and kerosene were used to ignite a wooden house, and the flames rose fiercely. The manager of Xin Factory used a Zhendan machine to inject foam at the head of the fire. Although the fire was fierce, it was extinguished immediately. The audience on both sides applauded and cheered. In order to strengthen the public's confidence, the manager continued to perform once, and the results were the same as before. Finally, the Provincial Public Security Bureau's Fire Brigade performed a disguised performance, divided into four acts: (1) Gambling leads to a fire; (2) Carelessly throwing cigarette butts leads to a fire; (3) Mosquito incense touching the ground leads to a fire; (4) Careless cooking leads to a fire. Among them, the fourth act, careless cooking, ignited the entire house. Suddenly, fire trucks, water hoses, and firefighters rushed to the scene, climbing onto the roof to cut off the fire lines and injecting water separately. All kinds of scenes were like rescuing a major fire. Especially when the entire house was destroyed, thick smoke filled the air and the flames soared, making people feel frightened. Finally, the firefighters performed jumping into the safety net. They jumped from the roof into the net without any injuries. The performance ended and the meeting adjourned at about 9:00 a.m.</p>

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: Fujian Province's local budget for the 24th year has been implemented since September. According to the budget, the annual revenue and expenditure will be short by more than one million yuan. Therefore, the Provincial Government is now strictly implementing increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. In terms of reducing expenditure, such as merging the ten administrative inspectorate commissioners' offices in the province into seven, more than 100,000 yuan can be saved annually. It is also planned to reduce the security regiment in the province to ten regiments, which can also save 200,000 to 300,000 yuan annually. The road construction project will be transferred to the county governments to be responsible for handling, and will not be paid for under the provincial appropriation. The road construction workers recruited in Zhejiang and Anhui for the various lines in northwestern Fujian will all be sent back to their hometowns. All road construction project offices will be reduced to road construction teams. The Yansha Yong Road Project Office will be changed to the First Road Construction Team, the Yonglian Road Project Office will be changed to the Second Road Construction Team, the Kanfeng Road Project Office will be changed to the Third Road Construction Team, and the Yanshunjiang Road Project Office will be changed to the Fourth Road Construction Team. The expenses saved each month are also considerable. Regarding increasing revenue, various local taxes will be strictly reorganized, with particular attention to the house and shop tax and the business tax. For bureaus and offices with large tax amounts, the Ministry of Finance plans to send personnel to supervise the collection or auditing. Because the malpractices in these two taxes are particularly deep, Weng Qingsheng, the former director of the Minhou Tax Bureau, was arrested by the Provincial Government and detained in the Security Office and the Public Security Bureau for collecting house and shop taxes from the people with white slips instead of formal donation forms. Zheng Xianlun, the former chief of the Second Section of the Ministry of Finance (currently still a inspector of the Ministry of Finance), was also arrested by the Provincial Government and detained in the Security Office and the Public Security Bureau for privately accepting subsidies from the seafood and sugar business tax bureaus, along with Huang Qinting, the director of the Seafood Tax Bureau, and Zheng Zhenfan, the director of the Sugar Tax Bureau. The authorities are currently collecting case files from all parties and will open the trial in the near future. Both the society and the political world believe that this is the most important case in the province's finances in the past ten years and are paying close attention to it. In addition, the Provincial Bank was originally scheduled to open on October 1st, and the employees of the office had all been arranged. Because the funds were not raised in time, it was postponed again. The Provincial Government has now allocated 600,000 yuan and decided to open on October 15th, and a branch office will be opened in Xiamen, and Deputy Manager Zhou Huanzhang has been sent there to prepare. After the bank is established, the Provincial Treasury will be transferred from the Central Bank to the bank for handling. The Ministry of Finance's loan of 500,000 yuan from the Central Bank has been approved by the head office and can be transferred immediately. It is agreed that 50,000 yuan will be repaid each month, with foreign rice used to offset taxes as collateral to meet urgent needs. (September 25)</p>

<h3 id="e99">Chinese Business Company to Be Reorganized; Yesterday Submitted a Request to the American Court to Appoint a Custodian; and Sent Separate Letters to Shareholders to Suspend Interest Payments <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>The American Evening Post reported that the American Chinese Business Company at 290 Sichuan Road submitted a request to the American Court in China this afternoon (26th) to appoint a custodian under Section 77B of the US Bankruptcy Act. Before the court makes a ruling, the company will continue to operate as usual. After the custodian committee is appointed, the company will be reorganized in the same way as several other companies in China, such as the United Theatre Company. According to a firm statement from the company's staff, the company's internal assets are substantial. The reason for taking this step is to view it as the most convenient way to protect the interests of those involved. The company's business includes buying, selling, and mortgaging real estate. The difficulties it has encountered are the same as those currently encountered by several other companies in Shanghai, that is, the matured funds cannot be recovered, causing the turnover to be unsustainable. All real estate companies have suffered greatly in recent months due to the impact of the recession. According to the statement, the company's capital that has been paid up totals approximately 7 million yuan, and unsecured bonds of approximately 10 million yuan and secured bonds of more than 6 million yuan have been issued. The assets and liabilities are sufficient to offset each other, totaling approximately 55 million yuan. Today, the newly appointed president and general manager, Mr. Walsh Pfeiffer, sent a circular to shareholders and holders of the company's 8% and 7% mortgage bonds, stating the company's current situation and the reasons for having to ask the court to appoint a custodian. The letter to the bondholders stated that the semi-annual 8% interest will not be paid when it matures, and the principal and interest of the 7% bonds that are due will also be suspended.</p>

<h3 id="e101">Consistent Promotion by All Industries; Bank Acceptance Drafts; Implementation of Acceptance Drafts Immediately Increases Leverage; Banking Industry Can Facilitate Refinancing <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Joint Preparatory Committee of the Shanghai Banking Association is planning to establish a joint bill acceptance house to create Shanghai bank acceptance drafts. The method involves industrial and commercial enterprises in need of financing providing collateral to the house. Upon the house's approval, they can issue drafts, which the house will accept. These accepted drafts can be purchased or discounted by various banks. Those requesting acceptance can thus obtain financing. Banks, after purchasing or discounting these drafts, can still sell or rediscount them to obtain financing if they need funds themselves.</p>
<p>Central China and Communications Banks Handle Rediscounting</p>
<p>The draft plan for establishing a joint bill acceptance house and the regulations for bank acceptance drafts have both been drafted by the Joint Preparatory Committee. After discussions with banking leaders, it is generally believed that these acceptance drafts are the only effective method to increase leverage and alleviate market conditions. It is reported that the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications have agreed to handle rediscounting for these bank acceptance drafts. After implementation, the Central Bank will announce the discount rate daily. It is now decided that after the Banking Association approves, the Joint Preparatory Committee will be commissioned to prepare for its establishment.</p>
<p>All Industries Agree to Promote Consistently</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency, after inquiring with relevant industries yesterday, learned that the decline of Shanghai's industry and commerce has reached an extreme point. Since the silk and satin industries first created commercial acceptance drafts, the discounting of these drafts has been able to replace the current credit lending, although it is not yet widespread, it has already achieved some success. Bank acceptance drafts can replace the current chattel mortgages, and are closely related to the future revival of industry and commerce. Therefore, it is hoped that they will be implemented as soon as possible, and all industries are willing to promote them consistently. After implementation, the difficulties of the fourth and tenth months of the lunar year for industry and commerce will certainly not occur again as they have this year.</p>

<h3 id="e115">If the Italy-Ethiopia Dispute Leads to War, It Will Affect China's Export of Native Products; Non-Essential Goods Will Inevitably Be Affected <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the recent dispute between Italy and Ethiopia is becoming increasingly serious. British and French fleets are concentrated in the Mediterranean, with a potential for an imminent outbreak. Regarding the impact on China's export of native products, a reporter inquired with the Shanghai Bank Investigation Office. The person in charge of the office provided the following detailed information:</p>
<p>War Will Disrupt Transportation</p>
<p>According to the person in charge, if Italy and Ethiopia inevitably go to war, and Britain is also drawn into the vortex, then the Mediterranean route will be cut off. The route from East Asia to Western Europe will either detour around the Cape of Good Hope in South Africa, or pass through the Panama Canal in the Americas, entering and exiting via the Atlantic Ocean, or pass from Vladivostok to Europe via the Siberian Railway. Transportation costs will be higher in each case. At present, neighboring countries of Britain will also be highly vigilant to prevent unforeseen circumstances. All production and consumption will lose their normal state. Consumption of non-essential goods will naturally decrease.</p>
<p>Sales of Peanuts and Tea Will Inevitably Decrease</p>
<p>China's important native products normally exported to Europe will likely be affected. The important ones are as follows: (1) Peanuts and peanut kernels: Last year, exports of peanuts and peanut kernels reached 13 million yuan, of which about 9 million yuan were transported to countries such as the Netherlands, Germany, France, Italy, Britain, Denmark, Norway, and Egypt. If war breaks out, exports will be greatly hindered, and prices may temporarily fall. (2) Tea: Last year, the export value of black tea was 12.6 million yuan, of which over 5.68 million yuan was transported to Britain, and 890,000 yuan each to the Netherlands and France. Since tea is not a necessity, consumption will inevitably decrease after the outbreak of war. Also, last year the export value of green tea was 22 million yuan, of which over 8.6 million yuan was transported to Morocco. Since Morocco is on the North African coast, located south of the Mediterranean Sea, it may be subject to blockade once war breaks out. Therefore, the future of the green tea market is not optimistic. (3) Broad beans: Last year, the export value was 1.6 million yuan, with over 1.11 million yuan transported to Italy and 840,000 yuan transported to Britain. In the future, there will be reductions and obstacles to exports. (4) Eggs: Last year, exports of eggs were 20 million yuan, with 19 million yuan transported to Britain. If the Mediterranean route is cut off this time, transportation will be more difficult. However, since eggs are a necessity in food, the impact may not be too great.</p>
<p>Huge Impact on Cocoon and Silk Exports</p>
<p>(5) Raw silk: Last year, the export value of white raw silk was over 14.43 million yuan, with 4.1 million yuan transported to France. The export value of gray raw silk was 520,000 yuan, with 420,000 yuan transported to France. The export value of yellow raw silk was 3 million yuan, with over 1.13 million yuan transported to France. Since raw silk is not a necessity, sales in France will inevitably decrease after the outbreak of war. (6) Native silk: Last year, the export value of white native silk was 510,000 yuan, with 140,000 yuan transported to Egypt. The export value of yellow silk was 3.76 million yuan, with 460,000 yuan transported to Egypt. After the outbreak of war, sales of this silk will also inevitably decrease. (7) Waste silk: Last year, exports of waste silk were 5 million yuan, with 1.53 million yuan transported to Italy, 930,000 yuan transported to France, and 630,000 yuan transported to Britain. Once war breaks out, the waste silk market will be greatly affected. (8) Cocoon silk: Last year, exports of Henan cocoon silk were 1.1 million yuan, with over 100,000 yuan transported to Egypt, France, and Germany. Last year, exports of Shandong cocoon silk were 3.3 million yuan, with 590,000 yuan transported to Britain and 170,000 yuan transported to France. If war breaks out, it will also have a considerable impact.</p>
<p>Carpets and Straw Mats Slightly Affected</p>
<p>(9) Carpets: Last year, exports of carpets were 4.84 million yuan, with 1.96 million yuan transported to Britain. Carpets are luxury goods. If war breaks out, there will also be a decrease in sales. (10) Straw braids and hat braids: Last year, exports were 1.9 million yuan, with 660,000 yuan transported to Britain and 440,000 yuan transported to France. After the outbreak of war, these straw hat braids may also be somewhat affected. In addition, although the United States is the largest market for golden grass hats, European sales are also not weak, and they may also be slightly affected after the outbreak of war. (11) Floor mats and straw mats: Last year, exports of floor mats were 1.25 million yuan, with 200,000 yuan transported to Egypt and 800,000 yuan transported to the Netherlands. Exports of straw mats were 3.93 million yuan, with 1.6 million yuan transported to Britain and 410,000 yuan transported to the Netherlands. This type of commodity will also have some impact after the outbreak of war.</p>
<p>Daily Necessities Will Improve</p>
<p>In addition, there are also metals that are sold in large quantities to Europe, but these are military necessities. If they are indispensable, they may improve after the outbreak of war. The above are all commodities that are negatively affected by the war. There are also quite a few commodities that will improve due to the war, such as cotton yarn, flour, and wheat. Generally speaking, during wartime, daily necessities often increase in price, while luxury goods tend to fall in price. Export commodities that are exclusively used by warring countries often have to fall in price, while commodities with wide sales will not be greatly affected. Subsequently, a report on the progress of negotiations in Shanghai. In addition to Ma, those who arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing yesterday included Navy Minister Chen Shaokuan and Vice Minister of Finance Zou Lin.</p>

<h3 id="e117">National Federation of Chambers of Commerce Telegraphs the Central Government Requesting the Abolition of Native Cloth Tax in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai Provinces; Various Provinces Disregard Orders and Arbitrarily Impose Taxes; Request Expedited Order for Abolition to Maintain People's Livelihood <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The National Federation of Chambers of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the National Government's Executive Yuan, Ministry of Finance, and Ministry of Industry, stating (address abbreviated): We have recently received a joint telegram from the Chamber of Commerce and Farmers' Association of Anlu County, Hubei Province, which briefly states: According to a petition from farmer representatives such as Chen Tongren of this county, the land in this county is barren and agricultural production is not abundant. The livelihood of farmers relies on hand-woven native cloth, which is sold in Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces for relief. During the Qing Dynasty, sales were extremely high. Since the establishment of the Republic of China, various provinces along the way have levied donations and taxes on native cloth, causing sales to decline daily. When the National Government established its capital in Nanjing, it was concerned about the decline of national goods and the poverty of the people. It first issued an order to all provinces to exempt taxes and donations on hand-woven native cloth, showing its painstaking efforts to promote national goods, which everyone appreciates. Unexpectedly, Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces disregarded the order and continued to collect taxes, and even invented special tax categories to deceive the ignorant. In 1929, representatives of the people of Anlu, together with representatives of the people of neighboring counties, jointly petitioned the Finance Department of the Hubei Provincial Government, and telegraphed the Central Executive Committee and various agencies and organizations, earnestly appealing for the abolition. The Central Executive Committee forwarded the matter to the Ministry of Finance for handling, and the Ministry of Finance approved that this native cloth was in accordance with the ministry's order and should be exempted from exchange. The provincial government issued a notice, and the ministry consulted the Shaanxi and Gansu provincial governments to follow suit. Unexpectedly, the Shaanxi and Gansu provinces turned a blind eye to the order and not only failed to exempt the original taxes but even increased them. What is particularly heavy is that a tax is added in one province and then another tax is added. For example, after taxes are added in Shaanxi and Gansu, another tax must be added when passing through Gansu. After taxes are added in Gansu, another tax must be added when passing through Qinghai. Even within one province, each region is divided, and those who pay taxes in the central region can only sell in region A. If they transfer to region B, they must pay taxes again. All kinds of repeated taxes are too numerous to list. The farmers in our county are therefore in danger of having their livelihoods cut off. Therefore, we specially petition your association to forward a request for the abolition, etc. Accordingly, we telegraphed your association to investigate and verify, and to expedite forwarding an order to the Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces to abide by the National Government's order of 1928 to exempt native cloth from taxes, as well as the Ministry of Finance's consultation request for tax exemption in 1929, and to immediately abolish the harsh and miscellaneous taxes and donations levied on native cloth, so that merchants can reduce costs and come to Anlu to purchase from a source, and the livelihood of Anlu farmers will not be cut off, in order to conform to the government's intention to promote national goods, and to serve as a disguised form of relief, so that the 300,000 disaster victims in Anlu will benefit immensely, etc. Approval is requested to present this telegram to your office, requesting approval to forward an order to the governments of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Qinghai provinces, ordering their subordinates to immediately abolish the taxation of native cloth, in order to facilitate the sale of native goods and maintain the people's livelihood. This is our most earnest prayer. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, respectfully bows and stamps.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Telegrams Request to Abolish Jiangxi Province's Collection of Tax on Domestically Produced Dyes <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangxi Provincial Government, requesting the suspension of the Qing Fei Shan Hou (Post-Banditry Suppression) Donation on domestically produced dyes. The original telegram is recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram to the Ministry of Finance</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance, Nanjing: We refer to the letter from the Da Zhong Dye Factory Co., Ltd., dated the 15th of this month, which states: On August 16th, we received your association's letter No. 2950, which briefly states: We have received the Ministry of Finance's approval No. 6686, which states: We are aware that special industrial products exempt from taxes by this ministry, except for business tax, which is levied on business activities, should not be subject to other taxes and donations when passing through various places. The matters mentioned should be consulted with the governments of Jiangxi and Guangxi provinces for their information. Please be informed, etc. We have recorded the approval and sent it to you, and we hope you will take note, etc. We have recently received a shipping order from our factory, shipping fifteen pieces of Yuan Qing dye to Jiangxi via the Jiangxi Qing Fei Shan Hou Donation Bureau and Jiujiang Collection Office. We were ordered to pay taxes in the same manner as imported goods, and the price was fixed at 141 yuan per piece of Yuan Qing dye, with a 5% levy. However, the sulfurized Qing dye shipped by our factory this time is cheaper than the original powdered Yuan Qing, selling for only 20 yuan per piece. At that time, there was a formal invoice as proof, but after repeated applications, not only was tax exemption not allowed, but the market value stated on the invoice was not allowed for taxation. In this situation, the tax burden on domestically produced dyes is actually higher than that on foreign goods. Most foreign Yuan Qing dyes are worth 70 to 80 yuan, and the lowest is also above 40 yuan. As a result, the cheap domestically produced dyes are burdened with higher taxes, leading to a decline in sales in Jiangxi. Moreover, according to the content of the Ministry of Finance's approval, our factory's products are tax-exempt, and we should not be liable for provincial taxes. Today, the reality is the opposite, and it is difficult to remain silent in terms of reason and emotion. We secretly observe that foreign dye merchants are actively seeking to destroy the budding growth of our domestically produced dyes, but the government is turning a blind eye and not providing assistance, and is instead imposing pressure in an invisible way. Our factory is making every effort to appeal, but our words are light and our influence is small, and it is still difficult to correct the situation. The situation is urgent, so we specifically state our difficulties, hoping that you will review and approve, and request the Ministry of Finance to issue a clear order to all provinces that all kinds of Yuan Qing dyes with the Chinese character trademark produced by our factory, regardless of where they are sold, should not be subject to provincial taxes, in order to remove the shackles on domestically produced dyes, etc. The Chamber of Commerce has received this communication. Since the receipt of your ministry's approval, it has been more than a month, and Jiangxi Province continues to collect taxes on the company's products that have been approved for tax exemption, and deliberately inflates the price, so that the actual tax is even higher than the 5% levy on imported goods. The national policy of caring for merchants and benefiting workers is implemented in the central government, but not in the local government. This matter concerns the national foundation and the lifeblood of industry, and it is impossible to remain silent. We hereby request your ministry to review and approve, and to strictly instruct the province to order a deadline for the suspension of the tax collection, in order to comply with the original tax exemption case and safeguard the national prestige. This is for the public convenience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows.</p>
<p>Telegram to the Jiangxi Provincial Government</p>
<p>Jiangxi Provincial Government, Nanchang: (Above omitted) Although your province has special circumstances in implementing the Qing Fei Shan Hou Donation, it is essentially a likin (internal transit tax). In the past, when likin was not abolished, likin was collected on ordinary goods, but likin stations also strictly complied with the law and did not force collection on items that were specially exempted from heavy taxes by order. Comparing today with the past, this minimum spirit of the rule of law should not be exceeded again. This is from the perspective of law. Porcelain is a special product of your province, and recently, because it is necessary to maintain this product, the Qing Fei Shan Hou Donation will also be suspended by the end of September this year. Therefore, although the Shan Hou Donation is generally collected on all kinds of goods, there has never been a lack of flexible measures. Yuan Qing dye is a step for our country to run its own artificial pigments, and it concerns the emerging chemical industry. The need to maintain it is no less than that of porcelain, and it should also be exempted from donations. This is from the perspective of principle. If both reasons are not adopted, then there is no reason to overvalue the price of goods that should be tax-exempt, resulting in a tax that is higher than the 5% levy on imported goods. We should request your government to order the bureau to change the tax rate according to the actual price on the invoice issued by the merchant, in order to comply with the fairness of the matter. This is for the public convenience. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce respectfully bows.</p>

<p>The British firm Jardine Matheson &amp; Co., which originally operated three steamers—the Baohe, Xianghe, and Jianghe—from Shanghai to Hankou, Shashi, and Yichang, has now decided to add a new steamer, the Xinpinghe, from tomorrow to navigate the middle reaches of the Yangtze River to Yichang. The first trip will depart from Shanghai this Saturday. As for the Sichuan River route from Shanghai to Yichang and then to Chongqing, Tai Koo, Minsheng, and other companies have added new ships. The company's original three ships—the Fuhe, Jiahe, and Xinchanghe—have been plying the route, and it has now been decided to add another steamer. Because the company has no ships to transfer, it has leased the Tian Guang steamer from the Asiatic Petroleum Company to join the Sichuan River service. From now on, the company has expanded to eight steamers operating on the Shanghai-Yichang and Shanghai-Yichang-Chongqing routes.</p>
<h3 id="e120">General Labor Union Telegrams Guangdong Requesting Abolition of Bran Tax; Cookie Merchants' Strike Still Unresolved; Oil Workers' Livelihoods in Panic <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Oil cake and miscellaneous grain merchants in various places have been on strike and suspended transportation to protest against Guangdong Province's imposition of a bran tax. More than a month has passed, and the situation remains deadlocked. The Shanghai General Labor Union believes that the number of oil factory workers in various places reaches more than 12,000, and their livelihoods have been greatly affected by the strike, leaving them without work to do and causing panic. Yesterday, it specially telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Committee, requesting it to order the abolition of the bran tax and to seek a solution as soon as possible. The original telegram reads: To the esteemed Southwest Political Affairs Committee of Guangzhou: The case of the oil cake merchants in various places striking and suspending transportation to protest against the Guangdong Province's imposition of a surcharge on bran for the construction of Sun Yat-sen University has been repeatedly appealed for a halt, and various groups have telegraphed for its abolition, but no approval has been granted, resulting in a stalemate that has lasted for more than a month. The resulting long-term suspension of business has stagnated the sales of oil cakes and miscellaneous grains in various places, causing significant losses to producers, and oil factories in various places have stopped work one after another because there is no work to do, putting the livelihoods of tens of thousands of oil workers on the brink of extinction. If a solution is not sought quickly, the situation will become more serious. It has been secretly investigated that most of the oil cakes produced in various places can be used by farmers for fertilizer because they contain more nitrogen and are suitable for the southern climate. Therefore, sales to Guangdong Province account for more than 63% of the national production. It can be imagined that it is related to our country's agricultural policy. At a time when foreign fertilizers are dumped in the country, the government should encourage domestic production and reduce or exempt donations on this important agricultural raw material to facilitate sales. How can we not plan for this but instead impose surcharges, causing producers to increase costs and farmers to increase burdens, harming both production and sales? We believe that this is not possible. Therefore, we telegraphed your committee to immediately inform the Guangdong Provincial Government to abolish the surcharge on bran as soon as possible, so that merchants in various places can resume business as soon as possible, so that tens of thousands of oil workers can avoid becoming starving corpses. The telegram is extremely urgent. Zhu Xuefan, Chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, Standing Committee Members Li Mengnan, Zhou Xuexiang, Ye Xianggao, Shao Xubai, and Long Peiyun, bow.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Ministry of Finance Explains Scope of Internal Documents; Refers to Non-Independent Capital Operations <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the regulations of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce on the implementation of the stamp tax, documents used "internally" that do not create "external rights and obligations" are exempt from stamp tax. However, how should headquarters and branch offices be interpreted? The Chamber telegraphed the Ministry of Finance for instructions. The Ministry of Finance's Tax Character No. 1213 approval states: We have received your presentation and telegram. Article 3 and other provisions of the Stamp Tax Law stipulate that all public and private organizations, whose internal documents do not create external rights and obligations, should be exempt from stamp tax. The organizations referred to in this article refer to the same organization. Warehouses, manufacturing plants, sales offices, or branches of various businesses, although there is a distinction between headquarters and branches, their capital and operations are not independent, but are actually the same organization. Therefore, documents used for mutual notification that do not create external rights and obligations can be exempted from stamping. However, some businesses have the same name for their headquarters and branch offices, but their capital and operations are completely independent, or the surface system appears to be a unified entity, but they are actually agents for others. These headquarters and branch offices each have their own rights and obligations, and the documents they use for mutual use should be subject to the provisions of Article 4 of the Stamp Tax Implementation Rules and should not be regarded as internal use. Please be informed. This is the approval.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Rent Reduction Committee Sends Letter to Authorities Requesting Reassessment of Land Prices <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Committee yesterday sent separate letters to the First Special District Civic Federation, requesting them to forward the letters to the Municipal Land Bureau and the Public Concession's Works Department, and to the Second Special District Civic Federation, requesting them to forward the letters to the French Concession's Municipal Council, requesting a reassessment of land prices. The Su recorded the original letter below. Respectfully, since the spring of last year, our committee has felt the opportunity of the decline in the market and observed the phenomenon of the decline of industry and commerce. Therefore, we think that the fundamental salvation lies in increasing income and reducing expenditure, and increasing income is valuable in seeking more blessings for ourselves, and reducing expenditure is more important than reducing rent. Based on this erroneous view, we shouted loudly, and the result of shouting back was that the road was one foot high, and the devil was ten feet high, and resistance was rampant, and the results were few. What is the phenomenon of real estate today, and what is its situation? It is obvious that without rent reduction, there is no way to seek the revival of the market, and land prices exceeding the actual value are the obstacle to rent reduction. In the golden age when real estate was growing day by day, the authorities often reassessed the price at any time. Today, the real estate situation is very different from the past, but we have not yet heard that the authorities have reassessed the land price according to the actual situation. Therefore, we specifically write to your association, requesting that you forward the request to the Municipal Land Bureau, Works Department (Municipal Council) to reassess the land price, in order to be practical and benefit rent reduction, so that the revival is expected, prosperity is expected, the market is fortunate, and the citizens are fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e125">Dr. Miller Discusses the Completion of the Guangzhou Sanitarium <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Miller, the director of the Shanghai Sanitarium, flew to Guangzhou on a Douglas-style aircraft on Tuesday of this week and returned north by plane on Thursday afternoon, landing at the Guanghua Airport. According to Dr. Miller, "The Guangzhou Sanitarium has officially opened, specializing in treating patients and teaching healthy people how to maintain their health." The completion of this hospital is very helpful in maintaining and promoting the health of the people of Guangdong. Therefore, people from all walks of life in Shanghai, Guangdong, and Hong Kong have generously donated to it. Our reporter also learned from Dr. Miller the history of the establishment of the Guangzhou Sanitarium as follows: There was a Guangzhou native, Liu Jian, who lived in California, USA. He wanted to return to his motherland to serve his poor and sick compatriots. Although he was a Christian and a member of the Seventh-day Adventist Church, he was not funded by any association. He paid his own way to enroll in a medical school in San Francisco. After graduating, he first practiced medicine in Fresno, California, and then returned to China at the invitation of the Seventh-day Adventist Church to practice medicine in Foshan, 60 miles southwest of Guangzhou. After years of hard work, he founded a well-equipped hospital there. He then opened a sanitarium in Nanning, Guangxi. After several years of development, it has now become a well-respected medical institution. When Dr. Liu was dedicating himself to serving the poor and sick, he unfortunately contracted cholera during an epidemic and tragically died within three days. However, Dr. Liu's sacrifice was not in vain, because the South China medical cause he founded has been continued by others. Two years ago, his colleagues who worked with Dr. Liu in Foshan planned to found a medical hospital in Guangzhou City. They selected a site near Dongshan and built it. After more than a year of preparation, a magnificent new-style hospital officially opened on September 25 this year. Dr. Miller, the director of the Medical Department of the China General Association of Seventh-day Adventists, said at the opening ceremony of the hospital that the association had established seven similar sanitariums in China in the past seven years, and this hospital is the most recently established one. As for its parent institution, the Shanghai Sanitarium, it was opened on January 1, 1928, at 150 Rue Pichon in Shanghai. It is said that Dr. Miller also consulted with the staff of various departments of the association in Wenzhou, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Shantou on various plans to develop church affairs during his travels.</p>

<p>The Far East Lumber Mill, located on the north bank of the Suzhou Creek in Zhoujiaqiao, Shanghai West, has more than 300 workers, mostly from Shandong. The business has always been prosperous. Recently, the mill has been affected by the sluggish market, resulting in a sharp decline in business. In order to maintain operations, the mill announced at the beginning of this month that it would reduce wages. All the workers unanimously expressed their opposition and demanded that the mill withdraw its decision, but to no avail, so they went on strike. The Social Bureau has repeatedly sent personnel and Director Tan of the Caojiadu Branch Bureau and others to mediate, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau dispatched a squad of police officers and all the patrol officers from the branch bureau to maintain order and protection at the mill. More than two weeks have passed. After repeated consideration, the mill has agreed to the mediation of the Social Bureau and Director Tan and will increase each worker's wage by 25 cents. The workers have also expressed their satisfaction. Wages were paid yesterday, and work will resume as usual today.</p>

<p>The Ju Kui area inside the Xiaodongmen of this city is the site of the old Shanghai County School. In the year [blank], twenty households including Chen Changsheng and others leased the land from the County Public Funds and Property Office. Now that the lease term has expired, the County Education Bureau has proposed to reclaim the land. Unexpectedly, the tenants, believing that they had been deprived of their right to negotiate a renewal of the lease, elected representatives Zhu Yaoyou, Xu Jingrong, Wang Yuankai, and others to submit a petition to the Shanghai County Government, denying the County Education Bureau's claim to reclaim the land. This case has now been reviewed and decided by County Magistrate Ye. The written decision has been sent to the petitioners. The full text of the decision is as follows: (Ruling) The petition is rejected. (Reasoning) According to the rules for filing petitions, the scope should be limited to administrative actions. The petitioners in this case leased the Shanghai County School site and entered into a contract with the Local Public Property Office, which is purely a contractual relationship under private law. After the County Education Bureau took over the site, the lease contract continued to exist. When the term expired and the land was reclaimed, there was nothing improper about it. In terms of its nature, it is a claim of ownership and not an administrative action. The petitioners believe they have been deprived of their right to negotiate a renewal of the lease, and they should file a lawsuit in accordance with the law with a judicial organ. An administrative agency is not in a position to accept it. Therefore, in accordance with the first half of Article 8 of the Petition Law, the ruling is as stated in the main text. If the petitioners do not accept this ruling, they should file another petition with the Jiangsu Provincial Education Department within thirty days from the day after receiving this ruling.</p>

<p>A few days ago, Mr. He Fu, the liquidator of the American-Oriental Banking Corporation, requested Mr. Hillmick, the Chief Judge of the United States Court for China, to approve the full payment of small amounts deposited in the bank, totaling approximately 42,000 yuan for 3,273 households. The presentation stated that the bank has now collected 625,000 yuan in cash. Before the liquidation is completed, the bank should have more funds than it currently has to distribute to depositors and creditors. There are 8,226 debtor accounts in total. The 3,273 accounts that are now proposed to be paid represent approximately 40% of the total. These deposits are all small amounts. Regardless of whether they are deposited in Shanghai dollars, Tianjin dollars, US dollars, Japanese yen, British pounds, Hong Kong dollars, French francs, or legal tender, they are equivalent to approximately 50 Shanghai dollars. If these small accounts can be fully paid, the liquidation work and expenses can be greatly reduced, and their total amount is not very large. As for the depositors and creditors who are not fully paid, the benefits of saving liquidation expenses are sufficient to offset the additional funds received by small households. Mr. He Fu's presentation was approved by Mr. Hillmick on Wednesday. The bank is now preparing to open for payment before October 1st. As for deposit interest, it is limited to those that have been settled into the account books. Those after the settlement date will not be paid. All depositors who owe debts to the bank that have not been cleared will not have their deposits returned.</p>

<p>Yesterday morning around 4:00 am, five or six robbers wearing blue-black short cloth jackets suddenly broke into the Wang Family Ancestral Hall in Xiaohoujiazhai, about two Huali north of Pengpu Town (commonly known as Miaotou) in Zhabei. Sha Jinkui, a 59-year-old man from Haimen who was in charge of guarding the ancestral hall, heard the noise and shouted for help. The robbers were furious and knocked Sha to the ground and stabbed him violently in the abdomen with a sharp blade, causing his abdomen to break open and his intestines to spill out. At the same time, Sha Jinkui's son-in-law, Liu Caiyi, and daughter, Liu Sha, also shouted and were stabbed three times in the neck by the robbers. They were lying in pools of blood. After committing the crime, the robbers, finding nothing of value in the room, snatched a wallet from the table in Liu Sha's bedroom and fled. By this time, someone had already reported to the Pengpu Town Police Station of the Xinzha Branch, and police were dispatched to the scene, capturing one robber, Wang Yongqing, 30 years old, from Tongzhou. A hatchet and a sharp knife were also found in the room. Police officer Gao Minglong rushed back to the police station and telephoned the Fire Joint Association to dispatch an ambulance to send the injured to the hospital. Liu Caiyi is currently in the Zhabei Jinshan Hospital, while Sha Jinkui's intestines were broken, and he was immediately sent to the Conscientious Hospital in the concession. According to the doctor, he had lost almost all of his blood and his injuries were extremely serious, and his life was in danger. The captured robber, along with the injured Liu Caiyi's wife, was taken to the police station. After a brief interrogation by patrol officer Xiang Zhaoxuan, the murder weapon and the hatchet were sent to the Xinzha Branch, which has been handed over to the detective team to arrest the remaining accomplices. According to Liu Sha, there were only two yuan in banknotes and a set of ten-yuan IOUs in the stolen wallet, as well as forty copper coins on the table, and nothing else.</p>
<h3 id="e144">Fire at the Xiechang Glass Factory's Celluloid Warehouse <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The entire warehouse and three residential houses were destroyed; the total loss is estimated to be approximately 20,000 yuan.</p>
<p>The Xiechang Weiji Glass Factory, located at 163 Lane, Hujia Wood Bridge, Zhabei, was founded by Cantonese merchants Deng Zhongze and others, with Deng also serving as manager. The factory buildings were also built by themselves on a grand scale, specializing in the manufacture of glassware, which was widely sold. However, due to the sluggish market, business plummeted. Deng and the shareholders gathered to discuss and temporarily suspended the shipment of glassware from the factory, switching to the operation of celluloid toy equipment and other products on the market, but there was still no improvement. Therefore, they had no choice but to announce the shutdown of the factory. Unexpectedly, at around 12:00 noon yesterday, a fire suddenly broke out in the factory's celluloid raw material warehouse. It was found that most of the raw materials were highly flammable and explosive substances such as rosin. Once ignited, it spread immediately. In an instant, the entire warehouse became a sea of ​​fire, and it also affected three buildings at 7, 8, and 9, 189 Lane on the right. The general residents nearby were greatly alarmed and fled in confusion with the elderly and children. At that time, the fire was still fueling the flames and increasing unabated. Fortunately, the Zhabei fire brigades had received the alarm and rushed fire trucks to the scene, but due to the intense momentum and wide area, it was difficult to achieve immediate results. A gas smell caused people to vomit. The firefighters were afraid of further spread, so they all fought bravely to put out the fire and raised cloud ladders to pour water from above and below. After about two hours of continuous watering, the fire gradually went out, but the smoke had not completely dissipated, so the Hongzhen District fire truck was left on the scene to continue to extinguish it. As a result, the factory and the three residences at 7, 8, and 9, 189 Lane, were completely destroyed, with a total loss estimated at approximately 20,000 yuan. Only the Xiechang Factory had fire insurance of 10,000 yuan. The cause of the fire has not been ascertained. The police station in charge has summoned Deng Zhuang, the bookkeeper of the Xiechang Glass Factory, for questioning and awaits verification.</p>

<p>Shandong people Shi Yuxi and his wife Wang Xushi, both 31 years old, previously lived at 8 Xinqiao Road, Nanshi, where they worked as factory workers to make a living. On the 20th of this month, the couple moved into the kitchen shed in the extra rooms of Liu Ni, a woman from Yancheng (40 years old), at 4 Yuanfuli, Belle Road, French Concession, with a monthly rent of three dollars. They only had one dollar saved when they moved in, and two dollars were still unpaid. The Wang couple had been unemployed for a long time, and their life gradually became difficult. Unable to find a way to make a living and struggle, the couple had the idea of ​​committing suicide together. On the night of the 24th, they found poison, swallowed it, and went to bed together, waiting for death to come. On the morning of the next day (25th) at 7:00 am, a friend of Wang went to Wang's residence and knocked on the door. When there was no response, he tried to open the door and went inside to check. He saw the Wang couple sleeping on the bed, already dying, and was shocked. He immediately informed the second landlord, Liu Ni, and reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. Wang Yuxi and Wang Xushi, husband and wife, were sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Wang Xushi died at 12:30 pm that night due to ineffective treatment. The hospital notified the police to transport the body to the Funeral Parlor of the Conscientious Hospital for an autopsy. Wang Chengzhai (22 years old, living in the Second Civilian Residence on Xietu Road, also a small worker), the nephew of the deceased, was summoned to the case. Yesterday, it was reported to the Special Second Court, and Prosecutor Wang Ren came to the station to confirm that Wang Xushi had indeed died from taking poison before death. The body was allowed to be taken by the nephew of the deceased, Wang Chengzhai, for burial. At the same time, Wang Yuxi, the husband who took poison, is still being treated in Shici Hospital. It is reported that the situation is very critical. Whether he can escape the danger depends on whether he can pass the dangerous period.</p>

<p>At 11:45 am on the 20th of this month, an assassination suddenly occurred at the entrance of 14 Furunli, Nanshi Chezhan Road. The victim was Bao Xiangfan Shun, a tea house contractor at the Wing On Company's Tiantianyuan Building. Later, according to Xiang's wife, Ms. Chen, she reported to the Municipal Public Security Bureau's Investigation Department that her husband had said before his death that the murderer was Hua Azeng, the general contractor of the Yong An Tea House, a Ningbo native. Detective team leader Gao Wansheng and others, together with Wang Shusen, a detective from the Laozha Police Station, arrested Hua at 24 Guangxi Road and sent him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, the police transferred Hua back to the Criminal Court of the Special First Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that the case was originally scheduled to be heard on Saturday. However, as instructed by the court, if the police found that Hua had no criminal suspicion, the case should be advanced. Now, police detectives first went to Shanghai Hospital to investigate. Dr. Chen of Shanghai Hospital received them and said that he and the nurses had not heard the deceased mention that the murderer was Hua Azeng. Later, the detectives also found out that Hua had stayed at his concubine Hua Ma's house at 1,000 Tongpu Road on the night of the 19th until 11:00 am the next morning, and then met with Yu Yongkang and more than a dozen other people to talk. At 2:00 pm, he went to Wing On Company to talk with Wang Yingzhou and others. At 4:00 pm, he went to his wife Hua Zhu's place at 24 Guangxi Road. The police detectives interviewed Yu Yongkang and others one by one, and their statements were consistent. Therefore, it is requested that the motion to transfer from the Public Security Bureau be decided that it is not necessary to transfer it. Then Wang Tanmu submitted a report on the investigation process. The court then ordered that the debate on the transfer issue begin.

<p>Wu Jinsheng, a Hangzhou native residing at No. 20, Lane inside the Sming Hospital entrance, Avenue Edward VII, French Concession, at the Lu Family Convent, recently engaged a lawyer to submit a petition to the criminal court of the Special Court, accusing Zhou Jiantang, a Ningbo native who also resides there, and Zhou's brother-in-law, Ye Dingyi, of obstructing freedom. It is alleged that the defendants have intruded into the residence without reason, staying and refusing to leave, causing disturbances. It is stated that Wu Dakun, the father of the plaintiff, was a vegetarian Buddhist. He bought land and built a house on Avenue Edward VII to house idols. After the grandfather's death, all property was transferred to the plaintiff for management. The defendants, using vegetarianism as a pretext, forcibly moved in and refused to leave, depriving the plaintiff of freedom. The plaintiff requests that the court investigate and punish them according to Articles 306, sections 1 and 2 of the Criminal Code. Based on the petition, the court summoned both parties yesterday for questioning. Judge Chen Pusheng opened the second criminal court for the trial. The plaintiff first testified as above. The defendant, Zhou Jiantang, testified that at the age of eighteen, he became a disciple of Yang Dakun, also known as Putian, and became a vegetarian Buddhist with the Dharma name Putai. In the seventh year of the Republic, he and his master Putian raised 1,000 yuan, bought a piece of land on Avenue Edward VII, spent 70 yuan, and built three bungalows. After the master's death, all the seals and yellow cloth bags used for promoting Dharma were handed over to me for management and safekeeping, and a seal with the inscription 'Putai at the Head' was also made (and presented to the court at the time of testimony). All property was entrusted to me for management, but the land deeds disappeared after the houses were built. Later, I learned that Wu Jinsheng had pawned them for 300 yuan at a Mr. Xu's place at No. 18, Yongye Lane, Weihai Road. Recently, Wu said that the land deed has been re-mortgaged for 1,000 yuan. According to the testimony of witness Qin Jiji, 47 years old, a Ningbo native, the deceased Master Putian, i.e. the plaintiff's grandfather, was in charge of the temple. After his death, his younger brother Zhou Jiantang succeeded him. The land was bought in the eighth year of the Republic for 70 yuan. The funds for building the house were raised jointly by Putian and Zhou Jiantang. After the houses were built, the land deeds were stolen, but Zhou Jiantang pays the annual land tax. According to the testimony of witness Pu Bai, 60 years old, a Suzhou native residing in Xiaobeimen, he calls Zhou Jiantang 'Grandpa'. He donated 50 yuan when the temple was built. He does not know the plaintiff. After reviewing the testimony, the court decided that the case required further investigation and adjourned the hearing to October 4th.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Times reports that Mr. Gorlt Hill, the American cookie king, arrived in Shanghai on Wednesday morning, intending to purchase two million pounds of dried eggs, and hoping to acquire several egg factories here, or obtain their management rights, within twelve days. Mr. Gorlt said to the guests, "The United States sells 300 million dozen cookies annually, most of which are produced by our American Cookie Company. The company also manufactures a large number of automatic cookie-making machines." Mr. Gorlt also said that the company does not want to sell its products in China, as the Chinese seem to have no spare money to buy them. It is reported that the raw materials needed by the American Cookie Company were previously purchased entirely from China. However, in the past two years, due to the increase in import tariffs on egg products in the United States, it has established its own factory in the United States for manufacturing. Recently, due to the rising prices of eggs produced in the United States, it is now planning to buy two million pounds of dried eggs from China annually.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Premeditated Murder Case Awaits Sentencing <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Dong Chenggui from Haimen and Lu Shouchang (also known as Si Quan), a local, used to work together as butchers at Tan Arong's pig slaughterhouse on Yuezhou Road. Tan's wife, Azhu, secretly became acquainted with Lu. After Tan's death, they openly cohabited as husband and wife. Dong knew the whole story and informed Tan's friends, Xiang Dongsheng from Baoshan and Shen A'er from Jiangyin. Everyone felt indignant about this matter and contributed money to hire soldier A'wu. Around 1:00 AM on the 22nd of September in the 18th year of the Republic, at an open space on Yuezhou Road, Zhaofeng Road, A'wu opened fire on Lu Shouchang, attempting to kill him, and then fled. Later, Dong Chenggui was arrested and sentenced to six years of penal servitude. He confessed that Xiang had provided 100 yuan beforehand, and that he and Shen had discussed the plan in a small hotel opened in Dongxin Bridge in the French Concession before carrying it out. On the 17th of this month at 7:00 PM, Inspector Yan Rongshi of the Detective Department of Avenue Foch, located in the Zhongxin Teahouse at No. 30, Beihai Road, Xinzha Road, apprehended Xiang and Shen. They were taken to the First Special District Court for questioning, where they denied the charges. It was ordered to postpone the hearing and bring Dong for identification. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi visited the Third Criminal Court for review. The representative of the Public Works Department, Zhishan, stated that, in the postponement, the two defendants were placed in a group of five other prisoners at the Detective Department for Dong to identify. Dong identified them correctly without error. Now, Dong is also present in court for questioning. A public prosecution was initiated against them for attempted murder under Article 271 of the Criminal Code. Lu Shouchang testified that he and the two defendants were all acquaintances in the same industry. Tan's wife, Azhu, had been living with him since her husband's death and there was no relationship before his death. At the time, he saw three people. Dong said, "The old man is here!" and immediately heard a gunshot. He ran away and escaped, suffering a slight bullet wound to his shoulder. Dong Chenggui claimed that he went with A'wu Wang Yougen at the time. A'wu fired the gun and the matter has nothing to do with the two defendants. He completely overturned everything he had testified in court before and at the Detective Department's identification. Xiang and Shen resolutely denied conspiracy and hired lawyers to defend them. Judge Jiang ordered that they be remanded in custody to await sentencing.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Repeated Kidnapping Cases: Notorious Bandits Under Interrogation. The Circumstances Are Serious and Still Under Investigation. The Bandits Are Remanded in Custody for Further Hearings <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>The notorious bandit Zhou Zhiliang, on the night of June 12th, 17th year of the Republic, along with Xue Xi'en and over thirty others, each armed with pistols and sharp blades, stormed into Zhang Zhanqing's house in the Yu Dong Six Jia Town, North Five Jia area of Nantong County, robbing property. When the owner resisted, it triggered the anger of the bandits, who killed Zhang Zhanqing's mother, Zhang Yangshi, and his brothers, Zhang Tianfu and Zhang Guangshun. Before fleeing, the bandits set fire to firewood and threw the corpses into the fire to destroy the evidence. They also shot and injured three members of the owner's family. The relevant authorities issued a warrant for their arrest. It is now known that Zhou Zhiliang, finding it difficult to stay in his hometown, fled to Shanghai. In November of last year, he gathered a gang to kidnap a certain person and demand a ransom. Then, on the morning of December 30th at around 7:00 AM, he gathered a gang at the end of Gordon Road and kidnapped Liu Shunde, the owner of the Lide Oil Factory in Xiaoshadu, demanding a ransom. Later, he kidnapped a Mr. Wu on Carter Road. The case was uncovered, and Zhang Weilin, Wu Yunbao and others who were suspected were arrested and brought to the local court. After several interrogations by Prosecutor Ouyang Shu, it was determined that Zhou Zhiliang and others were to be prosecuted for robbery, murder, and kidnapping for ransom. Briefly, Zhou Zhiliang acted together in robbery and intentionally committed murder, and injured more than two people, violating Article 1, Section 12 of the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Bandits. Zhang Weilin and Wu Yunbao repeatedly kidnapped people for ransom, and all violated Article 1, Section 1 of the aforementioned regulations. All should be sentenced according to Articles 9 and 42 of the Criminal Code. Zhou Zhiliang committed several crimes and should be sentenced according to Article 9 of the aforementioned and Article 69 and Article 70, Section 1 of the same law. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Tan Zhuohong specially opened the 11th courtroom for the trial. The defendant Zhang Weilin hired Lawyer Tao Ran to defend him in court. After the judge took the seat, he ordered that all the defendants be brought to the case. Zhou Zhiliang testified that he was 36 years old and from Tongzhou, and claimed that he was being framed. The judge said, "You committed a major case in Tongzhou, killing three people. The pistol is also yours, and thirteen pieces of original stolen clothing, trousers, and skirts were found in your house. Zhang Zhanqing's mother, Zhang Yangshi, was shot dead by you. Today, you still think of denying it in court. You should confess truthfully." He replied, "It's a wrongful accusation. My family has a 74-year-old mother, and a wife and children, a family of eight, all relying on me for a living. I request an investigation." Next, Zhang Weilin testified that he was 34 years old and from Tongzhou, earning a living by working. The judge asked, "In November of last year, you and your accomplices engaged in kidnapping." He replied, "There is no such thing." The judge asked, "On December 30th of last year, you went to kidnap Liu Shunde, the owner of Lide Oil Factory, for ransom." He replied, "It's a wrongful accusation." The judge asked, "How did you get arrested?" He replied, "A friend named Lu Guiqing borrowed money from me to smoke opium. I am against smoking and drinking, so I didn't lend it to him. He held a grudge and instigated false witnesses, accusing me of being a kidnapper. It's really a grave injustice, and I will die with my eyes not closed." Lai Yunbao testified that he was 44 years old, from Tongzhou, and made a living by pulling a rickshaw. Although he is from the same hometown as Zhou Zhiliang and Zhang Weilin, he does not know them. He used to work as a store clerk in Hongchang Sheng Fruit, responsible for delivering goods, for a total of 24 years. He has never committed a crime, and asks for investigation. The judge ruled, based on the testimony, that the circumstances of the case were serious and required further investigation. He scheduled a date to summon witnesses for further hearings. All defendants were remanded in custody pending further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Bloodshed Case on North Henan Road: The Issue of Opening the Safe Deposit Box. The Bank Has No Knowledge of the Items Inside the Box. The Signature on the Account Matches the Signature Card. <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the news of the tragic death of the housewife and maid in the bloodshed case on North Henan Road, which was reported in this newspaper yesterday, involving the safe deposit box incident at the Shanghai Bank, the bank has sent a letter stating that there are discrepancies with the facts. The original letter is reproduced below to clarify the truth. The letter states: "To the Editor: We have read the news of the tragic death of the housewife and maid in the bloodshed case on North Henan Road in your newspaper, which is quite detailed. However, there are two points that do not conform to the facts. We hereby explain them as follows: (Point 1) '...However, the bank, in order to comply with banking practice, refused to disclose the contents of the safe deposit box...' It is the customer's responsibility to place items in the safe deposit box, and the bank has no right to interfere, nor does it have any knowledge of its contents. The so-called refusal to disclose the contents of the safe deposit box was probably due to the fact that when the Western detective came to the bank to inquire, there was no court order, nor could he point out the account number and correct account name. Our bank was unable to answer at that time due to this misunderstanding. (Point 2) '...The defendant also claimed that he had stolen the key to the safe deposit box of the Shanghai Bank ten days ago, and then secretly engraved a seal and went to the Shanghai Bank to open the box and obtain a lot of wealth...' When a safe deposit box is rented, the seal must be submitted to the bank for comparison when opening the box in the future. The procedure is strict and prudent, and there is no way to open the box with a fake seal. After reading the account number in your newspaper, our bank immediately checked the signature card left by the customer to see whether the box was opened with a seal or a signature. Since renting the box, the customer has always used a signature to open the box. On the 23rd of this month, when the customer came to open the box, they also used a signature, and this signature was verified by our bank to be consistent with the signature card, and there is a record of the entry into the vault. The so-called secret engraving of the seal, if the defendant was not delirious when giving testimony, it was a mistake in the record. Our bank, due to business relations, cannot but solemnly declare this."</p>

<h3 id="e152">Yue Gengxin Talks About His Trip Investigating the Sugar Industry in the Dutch East Indies <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Zhu Gengxin, a standing member of the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association and manager of Xinyi Company, after investigating the sugar industry in the Dutch East Indies since August 1st of this year, and taking the opportunity to visit various sugar factories and sugarcane areas in Guangzhou, has now been two months. Mr. Zhu conducted a detailed investigation into the sugar production in various places in the Dutch East Indies, and was warmly welcomed by local officials and businessmen in negotiating the development of domestic product production and sales. Mr. Zhu returned to Shanghai on the 24th aboard the Dutch steamship Zhimin Canada, intending to contribute his findings to the industry. The reporter interviewed Mr. Zhu at Xinyi Company and asked about his trip. He graciously made the following remarks.</p>
<p>The Decline of the Javanese Sugar Industry</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu began by saying that he has been engaged in the sugar industry in Shanghai for nearly twenty years, and his long-cherished wish is to promote the Chinese sugar industry, so it is necessary to go to Java, the most prosperous place of sugar production, for investigation. "This time, my impression of Java is particularly good. The place is rich in resources and densely populated, and its importance is second to none among the islands. Sugar is the main product, followed by coffee. I have been to Batavia, Surabaya, Samarang and other ports. The municipal facilities in various places are very complete. The Dutch Sugar Company sent specialists to guide me to visit various sugar factories and sugarcane areas one by one. The advancement of production technology, the scientific management of factories, and the perfection of transportation tools between factories and sugarcane fields can all be used as a mirror for our country's sugar industry. However, under the shroud of this global economic downturn, the Javanese sugar industry also shows signs of decline. There were originally more than 180 sugar factories there, but now there are only thirty. The economic sector has suffered greatly."</p>
<p>The Dutch East Indies Has Not Banned the Import of Domestic Goods</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu continued, "I took advantage of this opportunity to go to Java to investigate the sugar industry and discussed the sales of domestic goods in the Dutch East Indies. The reason why domestic goods cannot be sold there is mostly due to poor sales methods, such as the exported goods not matching the samples, losing the trust of overseas Chinese, and the lack of sound sales agencies to compete with foreign goods. When I was in Java, I met with the economic committee of the Dutch East Indies, Consul Song of Batavia, Consul Guo of Surabaya, and the chairman of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce, to discuss the issue of developing foreign trade. All parties are willing to do their best to assist in the sale of domestic goods in the Dutch East Indies. For the sake of developing domestic goods, the overseas Chinese in Batavia have proposed holding a domestic goods exhibition in Batavia, which will soon become a reality. I hope that the Chinese people will work together and cooperate with the overseas Chinese to open up a garden for the development of domestic goods. It is rumored that the Dutch East Indies government prohibits the import of domestic goods, which is not true. It is true that the Dutch East Indies prohibits the import of foreign goods, but most of what it prohibits are certain foreign goods, and purely Chinese products are not among the prohibited items, but there are considerable restrictions."</p>
<p>The Guangdong Sugar Industry is Very Developed</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu finally said, "Guangdong is the most prosperous place for sugar production in our country. I specially went to Guangzhou for investigation when I returned to Shanghai. I was cordially received by Feng Rui, the Director of the Agricultural and Forestry Bureau of Guangdong Province, and the Manager of the First Sugarcane Factory in Guangzhou District of the Provincial Government. I was taken to visit various sugar factories and benefited a lot. The factories are equipped with new-style machines that can be used to make sugar from raw materials and to refine sugar from raw sugar. The factory equipment, management, and the efforts of the staff can all be used as a reference for us. What is regrettable is that the transportation is not perfect, which has a great impact on sugar production. In Java, there are light railways all over between the manufacturing plant and the sugarcane area, and the transportation is very convenient. In Guangdong, all are transported by boat. Due to the inconvenience of transportation, the sugar juice of sugarcane is greatly reduced. If improvements can be made in this area, the sugar juice of sugarcane can be increased by six or seven percent, and in a few years, it should be able to meet the needs of the whole country. These sugar factories are all large in scale. It is said that several sugar factories will also appear in Shantou next spring."</p>

<h3 id="e154">The Grand Performance of "Xi Shi" Opera <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Theater, starting yesterday, staged the five-act costume opera "Xi Shi" at the Carlton Theater. Both daytime and evening shows were sold out, and those who arrived later were still coming in an endless stream. In the first act, when King Fucha of Wu interrogated King Goujian of Yue, the scenery was magnificent and the atmosphere of the dance was extremely terrifying and tense. All the thousands of spectators in the audience were captivated. In the second act, when King Yue was imprisoned in the stone chamber, he performed the sorrow of the loss of his country with tears and a broken voice, which aroused the sympathy of the audience. The scene where Shi Limei teased King Yue's wife was particularly infuriating. In the third act, the song and dance scene of Zheng Dan and others had a background of a sunny spring morning, with beautiful scenery. The clear singing and beautiful dance made people suspect that they were in a fairyland. In the fourth act, King Fucha of Wu indulged in wine and lust, Wu Zixu's impassioned words, Xi Shi's clever words and flattering attitude, and Zheng Dan's suicide by jumping from the building, the climax of the act rose one after another, to the point of tension. In the fifth act, King Fucha of Wu lost his country and family, the Grand Master Bo Pi was captured and killed, and Xi Shi and Fan Li succeeded and fled, which was the final climax of the play. Each act included "Huansha Dance", "Ganjiang Dance", "Sutai Dance" and other famous songs such as "Sutai Song", "Homesickness Song", "Huansha Song", "How Can I Forget You", "The Girl in My Dream", "Xindan Song", etc., all of which are masterpieces of song and dance experts.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Opinions on the Issue of Increasing Capital (6) <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>(8) Application after the Concentration of Financial Power</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the progress of the financial system is seen in the concentration of power and the flexibility of turnover. In recent years, both the banking and money industries have their own joint reserve organizations. A few months ago, the money industry also abandoned its business of acting as an agent for banks to collect, disburse, and deposit bank reserves, transforming the abnormal downward distribution of reserves into a proper upward concentration. After the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Third Bank increased their capital and changed their organizational structure, followed by the transfer of management of some issuing banks, the movement of concentrating financial power has roughly taken shape. However, regarding measures to promote the flexibility of turnover, although efforts have been made separately by allowing the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Third Bank to provide financing and mortgages to the money industry, and by organizing the Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee to provide funds to general industrial and commercial enterprises, the trend is still to rely on the existing credit capital and the current lending system as a stopgap measure, failing to actively promote the establishment of modern credit capital and the grand scale of the financial industry. This is, of course, because the great disaster is imminent, and the situation is unstable, making it difficult to see long-term plans. However, in light of the principle that adversity builds a nation, future efforts should focus on using new credit capital to achieve the goal of flexible turnover, thereby creating an epoch-making progress in the financial industry.</p>
<p>Regarding the issuance of corporate bonds, Committee Member Chen Xiaodie once suggested using corporate bonds to exchange for financial public bonds. This may hinder the development of a long-term capital market for industry and commerce. After corporate bonds are exchanged for national bonds, what remains on the market will still be public bonds and treasury bills, and corporate bonds will not be included. In other words, the existing securities market will still be a financial securities market and will not be able to generate a long-term capital market for industry and commerce. Moreover, at a time when the state's finances are in deficit, the government must reserve a margin in the issuance of public bonds to cope with financial emergencies. Whether it can use more spare capacity for the exchange of corporate bonds is also questionable. We believe that the most important institutions for promoting corporate bonds are the underwriting agency and the trading market. Regarding the latter, the Chinese Securities Exchange can certainly assume its responsibility. Regarding the former, although the above article advocates that banks should vigorously promote underwriting as much as possible, the results will be slow, which is undeniable. To find a quick solution, we must open up new paths. The Central Trust Bureau is now ready. If the bureau can be used as the center to unite the financial industry and separately organize various syndicates for underwriting the issuance of various corporate bonds, the results will be faster. According to the underwriting business, which is originally a type of trust business, the Central Trust Bureau can naturally assume it. The most important thing in promoting any new movement is to establish a central force. If the Central Trust Bureau can lead the way, the financial industry will not find it difficult to follow and make it a success. This is better than the limited assistance provided by the government directly through the exchange of public bonds.</p>
<p>The main key to promoting bank acceptance bills and commercial acceptance bills is the rediscount of national banks. Only when national banks can provide general financial institutions with rediscount facilities can general financial institutions have nothing to fear and be able to provide strong financing to industrial and commercial enterprises by purchasing and discounting bills. The financing of national banks to general financial institutions, except when the international balance of payments is in deficit and cash must be used, is usually just a matter of transferring accounts. The reserves of ordinary banks are mostly concentrated in national banks, and the funds payable by Bank A are often the funds receivable by Bank B. The financing provided by the national bank to Bank A often goes directly into Bank B's deposit account in the national bank. Currently, the Central Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and the Third Bank have formed a tripartite alliance, and the trend of concentrating reserves in the three banks has been largely completed. With the cooperation of the three banks, it goes without saying that they can assume the task of rediscounting. If, in terms of issuance, we can follow the precedents of various countries in the East and West and appropriately incorporate bank acceptance bills and commercial acceptance bills as guarantee reserves, then the bills received by the three banks in the rediscounting business can be transformed into guarantee reserves to increase issuance. This will then provide a satisfactory solution to the demand for increasing payment capital. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e159">Nanyang Cup Men's Singles Final: Wang Wenzheng Defeats Qiu Feihai Again. After a Grueling Five-Set Match, Wang Wins After Losing the First Set; Qiu Succumbs Due to Inferior Stamina. <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>In the Nanyang Cup tennis tournament organized by the Shanghai Tennis Club, in yesterday's final match between Qiu Feihai and Wang Wenzheng, Qiu was defeated by Wang Wenzheng again with a score of two to three. Thus, the championship went to Wang. Qiu had previously lost to Wang in the advanced singles, and had hoped to get revenge, but ultimately lost due to age and inferior stamina. It is regrettable. He is expected to rest and recuperate his stamina in the All-China Games, so that he can be hopeful. There were also several exhibition matches yesterday, which are noted below.</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai's Golden Age: Because the two players had the same hitting style, with the only weapon being baseline rallies, yesterday's match between Wang and Qiu was less exciting. In the first three sets, Wang Wenzheng was unable to show his true colors, and his control of the ball was very weak. However, this was also Qiu Feihai's golden age. It was difficult to tell who was superior between the two on the court. However, Qiu had a slight advantage. In the first set, Qiu took the lead with a score of four to two, but ended up losing four consecutive games and losing with a score of four to six. In the second set, Qiu again took the lead with a score of four to two. After each returned, Qiu won two consecutive games and won the second set with a score of six to four. In the third set, Qiu won with a score of six to three with an extremely exciting hitting style, cross-court rallies, and unpredictable shots.</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng Makes a Comeback: In these three sets, Qiu Feihai controlled the situation, making Wang Wenzheng tired. In terms of hitting skills, Qiu was indeed above Wang. However, Qiu's fatigue was completely exposed. After a short break, the battle continued. Qiu was so exhausted that he could not cope, and gave Wang Wenzheng two bagels in a row. In the first two games of the fifth set, Qiu had tried his best to win, but he had run out of steam. Therefore, yesterday's final was clearly decided by stamina. In terms of hitting skills, Qiu was above Wang.</p>
<p>Exciting Doubles Exhibition: The Westerner hired by the Shanghai Tennis Club for the doubles exhibition match, Shan Qian Yaobin, teamed up with Tefu, while Chen Zhiqiang teamed up with Carson. Carter is a famous player in Shanghai, and Qian Chen is also a young rising star among Chinese players. Yesterday, he teamed up with Carter and performed seamlessly. The volley and retreat were wonderful. In the first set, Tefu and Qian Yaobin won. In the second set, Carter and Chen won. However, it was late, so the match could not be completed. The match between Zhou Jiaqi and Chen Qihao in Group C was also quite exciting. The results of each item are as follows.</p>
<p>Zhan Wenyiao vs. Wang Shuqing (Wang gave up)</p>
<p>Lao Jingxiu Presents Awards on the Spot: After the match, Lao Jingxiu, general manager of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company, presented the awards on the spot and gave a brief speech. The main points were: "Today, I am honored to represent our Nanyang Tobacco Company to hold the awards ceremony, and to meet people from all walks of life and tennis players. Our company is very satisfied with the results this time. However, the hope of winning the award is only for the champions and runners-up of each group. There are also some enthusiastic players who have not won the award, and I am very sorry. Put aside the concept of gains and losses, embrace the spirit of sports, and continue to practice hard in the future. This is what I hope." Then, he presented the prizes to the champions of each group and dismissed the meeting.</p>

<h3 id="e161">Municipal Government's New Pool Scheduled to Hold Hong Kong-Shanghai Swimming Showdown; Decided for the 1st and 2nd of Next Month; First Battle with Hualian, Then Battle with Xilian <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>News of the Mermaid Sisters Yang Xiuqiong and Yang Xiuzhen and the Hong Kong representative team performing publicly in Shanghai has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. The director of the Hong Kong representative team, Ye Guan, and the leader, Chen Ziqing, discussed the preparations for the open competition with Section Chief Li Dachao at the municipal government yesterday afternoon. The reporter of the Guoguang News Agency specially investigated and recorded the details as follows.</p>
<p>Mermaid Rescheduled to Depart Tomorrow</p>
<p>Regarding the departure of the Mermaid, the previous telegram stated that they were approved to take the Cleveland wheel north, but the Hong Kong director, Ye Guan, had not received a telegram stating Yang had departed by yesterday evening. It is likely due to unforeseen circumstances, and they must depart from Hong Kong tomorrow (the 28th). The Hong Kong male and female swimmers, a group of fifteen, led by Yang's father, Yang Zhunan, will also take the President Jefferson north on the 28th. The ship is expected to arrive in Shanghai on the 30th. This time, the Hong Kong male and female swimmers participating in the All-China Games have very strong strength, and the call for winning the championship is extremely high. The municipal government plans to invite the entire team to perform at the municipal swimming pool for two nights.</p>
<p>Municipal Government Discussed and Decided Yesterday Morning</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Section Chief Li Daqi of the municipal government specially convened the leaders of the Hong Kong and Shanghai swimming circles at the municipal government conference room to hold a preparatory meeting. Director Chen Ziqing and Director Ye Guan of the Hong Kong swimming team, and the Shanghai swimming instructor, Peng Sanmei, captain Jian Erming, and others, were present. Presided over by Li Dachao, the results of the discussion were: to invite the most elite Chinese and Western male and female swimmers from Shanghai to compete against the male and female swimmers from Hong Kong. The dates are allocated as follows: 8:00 PM on the 1st of next month, the Hong Kong representative team will compete against the Shanghai Hualian team; 8:00 PM on the 2nd, the Hong Kong representative team will compete against the Shanghai Western team. The program is still being drafted. There will be water polo performances on both nights. Tickets are divided into two types: one yuan and two yuan.</p>
<p>Strength is Tight, Victory is Difficult to Predict</p>
<p>The sisters Xiuqiong and Xiuzhen have made great progress recently. After a long absence, there will definitely be special achievements on both nights. It is a pity that the frog king, Guo Zhenheng, represents Guangdong this time and cannot participate in the grand event. Although the Hong Kong team has extraordinary strength this year, the Shanghai Chinese and Western teams are not weak either. Liang Weisheng has also made rapid progress recently and will definitely have a close match with Chen Zhenxing from Hong Kong. The inter-port players Jian Erjie and Shibo Gen can also return to Shanghai today, adding a new force to the Shanghai team. Veterans Zhou Ruiqin and Huang Rixiong, and the young player Jian Erlian, have been resting and recuperating these days, preparing to fight hard and give the Hong Kong team a shock.</p>
<p>Sixty More Public Buses Added</p>
<p>The municipal government is actively preparing for this competition, predicting that the strength of both sides is tight, which will be the first grand occasion since the opening of the municipal pool. At that time, the audience will definitely be crowded. The Chinese Public Bus Company is specially ordered to add sixty more public buses, running non-stop, to reduce congestion. It is also heard that the Hong Kong team's funds are extremely short, and the travel expenses for various representative teams to Shanghai have not yet been settled. Therefore, the swimming and football teams were sent first. The municipal government will donate all the ticket revenue from the two nights to the Hong Kong team as a farewell gift, in addition to covering costs. The remaining teams must wait for the proceeds from the performance ticket sales to be remitted before they can come to Shanghai. There are also plans for the Hong Kong football team to perform with Shanghai's strong teams, which are currently being negotiated.</p>

<p>The Shanghai delegation of twelve people participating in this year's Hong Kong-Shanghai Interport Swimming Competition departed from Hong Kong on the President Cleveland liner on the 25th, heading to Shanghai.

It is reported that the team leader, Hai Meng, needs to travel to Xiamen and Shantou on official business, so he could not return with the team. The reason for the Shanghai team's crushing defeat this time is due to acclimatization issues, with nearly half of the team members falling ill. They participated despite their illness, so their performance was naturally poor. However, the team emphasizes that sports are about spirit, and victory or defeat is irrelevant to honor, which is highly praised by the Western and Chinese media in Hong Kong.

<p>Autumn Sports Meet Held Simultaneously</p>
<p>Chih Chih College on Jiangwan Shuidaian Road has always paid great attention to athletics. Several years ago, the "Five Tiger Generals" of basketball were famous in Shanghai, highly regarded in both the Western and Chinese Basketball Associations. Unfortunately, during the January 28th Incident, all of the college's school buildings and athletic facilities were destroyed by artillery fire, and athletic programs were inevitably suspended. Fortunately, thanks to the dedicated efforts of the college president, He Shizhen, and his brothers over the past three to four years, the college has been restored to its original state. Magnificent buildings once again stand tall beside Shuidaian Road, and the track and field, outdoor basketball court, tennis court, and volleyball court are even better than before.  It is reported that the college has decided to construct a gymnasium to further promote athletics, and a groundbreaking ceremony will be held this Saturday at 9:00 AM, along with the autumn sports meet. It is said that the college has a strong track and field team, with as many as eight or nine athletes representing the city at the National Games, including Zhang Jiayu, Dai Shuguo, Lin Shaozhou, Chen Jiayou, Li Yuanda, Qiu Zhongcheng, Ma Qingyuan, and Hong Yongtang, who have achieved excellent results. Therefore, it is certain that the college's autumn sports meet this Saturday will produce excellent results.</p>

<p>Implementation Period: October 10th to December 10th</p>
<p>The "National Children's Relief Measures for Disaster-Stricken Children" have been drafted by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee and submitted to the Ministry of Education for approval and issued to the education departments and bureaus of various provinces to follow. The measures are as follows:</p>
<p>1.  These measures are specifically aimed at mobilizing children nationwide to assist in providing relief to children in disaster-stricken areas, mobilizing junior high and elementary school children nationwide to raise money and goods in the shortest possible time to provide relief to children in flood-affected areas.</p>
<p>2.  Participants in the disaster relief effort will primarily consist of junior high and elementary school children (excluding kindergarten students), with educational administrative personnel and junior and elementary school faculty and staff responsible for guidance and supervision.</p>
<p>3.  The implementation period for these measures will be two months, from October 10th, 1935, to December 10th, 1935.</p>
<p>4.  The implementation of these measures will be divided into three steps:</p>
<p>Step 1: Fundraising</p>
<p>(1) The fundraising period will be one month, from October 10th, 1935, to November 10th, 1935. (2) For the fundraising procedures, the National Children's Year Implementation Committee will first submit these measures to the Ministry of Education for distribution to the education departments of various provinces, which will then instruct the relevant educational administrative organs in various counties and cities, and distribute them to the directly administered cities of the Executive Yuan, instructing their subordinate schools to comply. (3) The scope of fundraising items will be limited to cash and children's clothing, pants, hats, shoes, socks, quilts (old but clean items are also acceptable), etc. (4) After receiving these measures, local schools should immediately organize a disaster relief group for children in disaster-stricken areas, with the principal as the leader, and set up propaganda, fundraising, and safekeeping groups. Teachers should be appointed to serve as the leaders of each group, and older children (over ten years old) should be assigned to serve as members of each group. If the number of students in a school is too small to organize independently, they may jointly organize with nearby schools. (5) The duties of the group leader are as follows: 1. Organize the disaster relief group for children in disaster-stricken areas, appoint group leaders, and direct the work of each group. 2. Plan the steps for the group's progress. 3. Supervise each group to work hard. 4. Compile fundraising results and report to the relevant educational administrative organs. (7) The duties of the propaganda group are as follows: 1. Post slogans and paintings related to the disaster situation in disaster-stricken areas. 2. Draft the fundraising goals of the group and publish them in local newspapers or distribute leaflets. 3. Screen films about the floods (in consultation with local public education centers). 4. Describe the flood situation in various places. 5. Hold disaster relief performances. (7) The duties of the fundraising group are as follows: 1. Solicit donations from teachers, students, alumni, and other staff members of the school. 2. Solicit donations from the parents of students at the school. 3. Solicit donations from the neighbors of the students at the school. (8) The duties of the safekeeping group are as follows: 1. Keep the collected funds safe. 2. Keep the collected items safe. 3. Record fundraising results and report to the group leader. (9) In addition to soliciting donations from others for money and goods, each child (except for those who are truly impoverished) should donate the following amount of money: 1. Children in lower elementary school: save one copper coin per day on candy, totaling thirty coins per month. 2. Children in upper elementary school: save two copper coins per day on candy, totaling sixty coins per month. 3. Children in junior high school: save five copper coins per day on pocket money, totaling one hundred and fifty coins per month.</p>
<p>Step 2: Remittance</p>
<p>(1) Each school should prepare a detailed list of the money and goods collected and remit them to the relevant educational administrative organs in each county and city before November 15th, and make a detailed list of the money and goods raised by each child and the amount of money donated by each person, and post it at the school gate, and inform each child. (2) The relevant educational administrative organs in each county and city should prepare a detailed list of the money and goods collected by each school in the county and city and remit them to the relevant education departments before November 20th, and publish the detailed figures of the fundraising achievements of each school in the county in the newspaper for reference by each school. (3) The education departments and bureaus of each province and city should remit the collected money to the Central Relief Committee before November 30th, and report the list of goods to the Central Relief Committee. After the Central Relief Committee has determined the distribution, the education departments and bureaus of each province and city should send them directly to the nearby disaster-stricken areas, and compile the fundraising achievements of the entire province and city. The city should publish the detailed figures of the fundraising achievements of each school in the newspaper, and the province should publish the detailed figures of the fundraising achievements of each county and city in the newspaper, and distribute them to the relevant departments (schools for cities, counties for provinces), and report them to the Ministry of Education, and notify the National Children's Year Implementation Committee for verification.</p>
<p>Step 3: Distribution and Awards</p>
<p>(1) The Central Relief Committee, together with the Ministry of Education, the National Children's Year Implementation Committee, and the provincial education departments in the disaster-stricken areas, will properly distribute the collected money and goods before December 12th, taking into account the severity of the disaster in various places, and compile the fundraising achievements of children nationwide and publish them in newspapers. (2) The money and goods will be distributed to various relief agencies, and each agency will issue a receipt for the goods and give them to the disaster-stricken children. (3) With the consent of the Ministry of Education and the National Children's Year Implementation Committee, a portion of the money may be set aside to establish shelters for children in disaster-stricken areas and provide them with appropriate education and care. (4) Local children's year implementation committees should award honorary certificates to the schools and children with the best fundraising performance in their respective regions. The schools and children with the best fundraising performance in each province and city and nationwide will be awarded by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee.</p>
<p>5. When schools in various places raise money and goods for disaster relief, local educational administrative personnel and the hunting clothes year implementation committee should be responsible for supervision, guidance, and oversight.</p>
<p>6. If the school is located in a disaster-stricken area, the collected money and goods may be directly handed over to the local relief agency for distribution to the disaster-stricken children, while a list should be prepared and submitted to the relevant educational administrative organs.</p>
<p>7. If the county or city where the county and city educational administrative organs are located has disaster-stricken areas, all or part of the money and goods collected in the entire county or city may be directly handed over to the county and city relief agencies for distribution to the disaster-stricken children, while a list should be prepared and submitted to the relevant education departments.</p>
<p>8. If the province where the provincial education department is located has disaster-stricken areas, all or part of the money and goods collected in the entire province may be directly handed over to the provincial relief agencies for distribution to the disaster-stricken children, while a list should be prepared and submitted to the Central Relief Committee, the Ministry of Education, and the National Children's Year Implementation Committee.</p>
<p>9. If there are any errors in the handling of the funds by the agencies, the children's year implementation committees of each province, city, and county will report them. If the circumstances are serious, the person in charge will be dismissed and prosecuted according to law.</p>
<p>10. These measures will be implemented upon approval by the National Children's Year Implementation Committee. (Central News Agency, Nanjing, 26th) The National Children's Year Implementation Committee, based on the resolutions of the Fifth Congress, has drafted "National Children's Relief Measures for Disaster-Stricken Children," which have been submitted to the Ministry of Education for instruction to all junior high and elementary schools nationwide to follow. The implementation period will be from Double Tenth Day of this year to December 10th.</p>

<p>Due to the relatively late climate in Qingdao, the winter and summer vacations of National Shandong University are postponed by three weeks. The school year began on September 21st. The 16th to 19th were the registration period for new and old students, and the 20th was the fifth anniversary of the school's establishment, a holiday. The enrollment results for this summer show that 195 freshmen and 9 transfer students have been admitted. They have successively arrived at the school to complete the admission procedures during the registration period. The school has hired many new professors and lecturers this semester, such as: (1) Department of Chinese Literature: Shu Sheyu (Professor), You Guosen (Professor), Hu Mingsheng (Professor and Director of the Library), Wen You (Professor), Luo Yujun (Lecturer); (2) Department of Education: Chen Chuanzhang (Professor), Li Fan (Lecturer); (3) Department of Physics: He Zenglu (Professor), Phil (Lecturer), Jiang Cang (Adjunct Professor); (4) Department of Chemistry: Shao Dehui (Professor); (5) Department of Biology: Lin Shaowen (Professor and Department Head), Zeng Chengkui (Lecturer); (6) Department of Civil Engineering: Yu Liji (Professor), Xiao Jin (Professor); (7) Department of Mechanical Engineering: Igor (Professor), Li Liangxun (Lecturer), Jin Yaozhang (Professor of Social Sciences).

In addition, the hydraulic test hall and engineering hall, which were started during the last semester, were designed and drawn by Qingdao Lianyi Company and contracted by Shanghai Chuangxin Company. Because the number of classes in the school's engineering college has increased this semester, the existing classrooms and practice space are insufficient. Therefore, the construction was accelerated during the summer vacation, and it is expected to be completed and put into use within ten days of the start of school.</p>

<p>Adding Serial Pictures, Welcoming Schools to Send Representatives</p>
<p>The Children's Daily, published by the Children's Daily News Agency at 172 Baoshan Road, Shanghai, has been enthusiastically subscribed to by schools, families, libraries, civil education centers, and children both locally and abroad since its founding on September 1st due to its excellent content and strong interest. In addition, because the materials are very timely, the number of elementary and high school students who choose them as supplementary teaching materials is increasing day by day. Even lower grades are very welcome because of the many pictures and shallow texts. Now, in order to increase children's common sense and interest, the newspaper has added a very interesting full-length picture story "The Puppet's Journey to Africa" on the first page and a very meaningful "Hands and Brains World" handicraft game on the second page, changing patterns every day. The price is 36 cents per month, one yuan for three months, one yuan and eight cents for half a year, and three yuan and three cents for the whole year. Postage is an additional 15 cents per month. There are school representative regulations for subscription, which will be sent upon request by letter. If someone in a school is responsible for the distribution, a small remuneration will be paid, and it can save children a lot of postage.</p>

<p>— Original by American Ms. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Mr. Bae saw the cow and heard the story. He didn't say much, obviously fearing that he would be unable to restrain himself under the sudden shock and would say too much. He just settled Lao Huanghua in her shed and asked the children to go back to their rooms and come out for dinner.</p>
<p>Such a short rest gave them an opportunity to think about this matter once, to guess what punishment they would receive, and to imagine where Dunn would be sent. He was in his own room, just whistling to himself, putting on an indifferent attitude; but as he waited for the decision of his fate, the desire to stay gradually grew stronger, as he recalled the comfort and good treatment he had received here, and the suffering and indifference he had encountered elsewhere. He knew they were trying to help him, and deep down he was grateful, but the rough life he had encountered had made him a cold, reckless, suspicious, and stubborn person. He hated any restrictions, even when he knew they were well-intentioned and it seemed he could really benefit from them, but he still resisted them, like an untamed beast. He was determined to return to that wandering life, bumping around the streets, as he had lived his entire life; the thought of that future made him tighten his thick black eyebrows, and he looked around the comfortable little room with a look of attachment. If Mr. Bae had seen this, his heart, even if it had been many times harder, would have been moved. These thoughts disappeared immediately when that good man came in and said in his inherent solemn tone:</p>
<p>"I've heard everything, Dunn. Although you've broken the rules for the second time, I'm going to give you another chance, to please Mrs. Bae."</p>

<p>Time is like a runaway horse, and people are poisoned by its galloping, turning red faces into white hair.</p>
<p>No peace is comparable to the peace of conscience. The tranquility in this small space is like the harmony obtained by heaven and earth.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Taijiquan <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>There are several ways to practice Taijiquan. In the city, old masters, young masters, ladies, and grandmothers like to play Taijiquan by the mahjong table all day and night! It is said that this kind of "pushing hands" skill, although the "routines" are different, the effect of "nourishing the heart" and "calming the nerves" is the same.</p>
<p>The Taijiquan I am going to talk about now is not like that.</p>
<p>More than ten years ago, I saw many people practicing Taijiquan in Beiping. In the Central Park in the spring and summer seasons, it was simply transformed into a gymnasium, with people practicing everywhere. Among them, there was an old man over seventy years old who practiced the most diligently, and he was seen every morning. Because we saw each other every day, I got to know him and heard him tell me a lot about the benefits of Taijiquan.</p>
<p>According to him, once people pass middle age, if they do not pay attention to health preservation, most of them have excessive fire and weak water, which is extremely harmful to the body. The greatest effect of Taijiquan lies in regulating "water" and "fire" and enriching the inside of the human body. He also said that if you reach the ultimate level of Taijiquan, all "fire" will be eliminated, and you will truly have the style of a "humble gentleman"! There is absolutely no such thing as the bravery and fighting spirit of practicing external martial arts!"</p>
<p>I agree with the point that Taijiquan can regulate "water" and "fire" and enrich the interior. If you say that practicing Taijiquan will eliminate all anger and turn you into a humble gentleman! Then I think it's better not to practice! Because the biggest weakness in the personality of us Chinese is the lack of a considerable amount of "fire"! There are too many people who want to be humble gentlemen! Therefore, there are too few people who can express a spirit of courage and unyielding! How can we withstand practicing Taijiquan again!</p>
<p>Some people say that strengthening the body is one thing, and anger is another. We must first make everyone strong, and then stimulate their proper "anger", so that they can complement each other. Because "strengthening the body" and "anger" are both indispensable things.</p>
<p>I think this sentence may be correct.</p>
<h3 id="e189">The Bloody Tears of a Singing Girl <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Shouqiu</p>
<p>At a banquet of my friend Mr. Zhang, I met a relatively familiar singing girl, who, when the wine was gone and the guests were gone, talked about the pain of the singing girls.</p>
<p>According to her, singing girls originally make a living by their skills, because they are singers, relying on their natural throats; through ordinary research, in a Qingchang teahouse, they use a few tens of yuan in silver to support their families, which, from the standpoint of self-reliance, is also a legitimate profession. However, the general audience who listen to the singing does not care about the quality of the singing, but pays attention to the ugliness; especially those with good faces and loose waistbands are the most popular. If they are well-behaved singing girls, no one is willing to help them, because this kind of audience is not interested in the wine!</p>
<p>Because of this situation, most singing girls have to sacrifice themselves to make their families survive. You must know that in this present time of expensive rice and firewood, relying on only a few packages of silver not only cannot support the family, but even maintaining oneself is not enough. So they have to cater to the needs of the audience and engage in that shameless side business! So the prostitution of singing girls is really forced to this point, and it can also be said to be given by a bad society. You must know that a person always wants to improve, but when it is unavoidable, he has to sacrifice!</p>
<p>After she finished saying these words, her cheeks were covered with tears, and both Mr. Zhang and I felt injustice for them! Really, society treats them too cruelly! Although they want to be singing girls who sell their art but not their bodies, it is impossible in fact! Alas!</p>

<p>Xu Zheshen: He is a well-known novelist and essayist of the Shanghai school who is helping to alleviate disaster by lowering his writing fees. In recent years, in addition to writing novels, he has also been writing poetry and essays. This summer, he suddenly suffered a dangerous illness and is now recovering. Therefore, his writing work has been suspended for a long time. A week ago, Xu's poetry and novel correspondence students from all over the country came to Shanghai because of the floods and sought refuge with their teacher to temporarily maintain the status quo. Witnessing the situation, Xu thought of the compatriots of both genders who were suffering in the disaster areas, who must be worse off than the students. Therefore, he vowed to lower his writing fees for three months, and then donate half of the proceeds to help the refugees. People in Shanghai who love Xu's writing can obtain a reduced fee form from 31 Weixin Lane, Xinyuan Sauce Garden Lane, in this city. It not only establishes a literary connection but also benefits the general public.</p>

<p>Looking again, Yueying was actually sitting on the ground, her clothes covered in dust. She was lying on the chair, crying with her shoulders shaking. Even without seeing her face, just hearing her sobbing, one could imagine that she was extremely sad. At this time, sending cosmetics to someone was inevitably a joke. However, the cosmetics were tied up in a large package, which was being held in her hand. In fact, she couldn't throw the things away, and she was so anxious that her face turned red. Jia Duocai was full of grief and anger, and he was hating that there was no way to vent it. Seeing Shi Geng's hesitation, he said: "Shi Lian, just come in and sit, it's nothing. Humph! I have already made a fool of myself." Li Shi hesitantly walked in, blew the dust off the table, and put down the cosmetics. Then he leisurely said to Yueying: "We have a new sister-in-law. Following Old Master Jia, you have risen to the sky in one step. Why are you always crying when things are not good? Moreover, now that you are a wife, you should learn some rules from Old Master Jia. How can you lie on the ground and cry?" Jia Duocai listened to these words, got up immediately, and sighed. Yueying, supporting the chair, stood up and shrank to the corner of the room. She slowly brushed the dust off her body and took out a handkerchief from her body. She rubbed her eyes and then smoothed her hair, saying to Shi Lian: "Mr. Li, how can I not understand what you said? It's not that I insisted on sitting on the ground. I heard that my grandmother is very sick and I want to go back to see her. I begged Old Master Jia last night and I have been begging until now, but Old Master Jia always refuses. Later, I said that if Old Master Jia is really worried, you can go back with me to see her. Fortunately, the road is not far away, just behind this Little Western Heaven." (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager would often raise her hand, carefully examining it with great interest, and sniffing it with her nose, never tiring of it. Not only did she like it herself, but she also wanted to teach us to do the same. However, we could never feel any interest like she did. Only after going to the toilet or getting something fishy or smelly on our hands would we pick some green chrysanthemum leaves to wipe them, in order to offset the dirty smell. At other times, no one was happy to go to the ruined places where those flowers were.</p>
<p>Among the chrysanthemums, it is said that there is also a rare variety called the "Green Peony". Its color is green; definitely not light green, but dark green. There are very few green flowers, and it is not only chrysanthemums that are like this. It seems that green chrysanthemums are particularly rare. I have long heard people say that there is such a thing as a "Green Peony" chrysanthemum, but I have never seen it. The Empress Dowager naturally knew about this different species long ago, so she had been constantly sending people out to search for it for several years. Of course, how could the orders issued by such a towering female politician have no effect at all? Soon, many people offered dozens of pots of chrysanthemums labeled with the words "Green Peony", but the flowers they bloomed only had a slight green color, not enough to be called "green". How could the Empress Dowager be satisfied? So she continued to search. Later, someone sent four pots. At first glance, the color of the flowers was indeed as green as green jade, but after being displayed for a few days, the color suddenly faded. After the Empress Dowager personally examined it carefully, she realized that someone had dyed white chrysanthemums with green color to pretend. Naturally, this made her very angry, and the person who presented the flowers almost fell into the iron window because of this. (426)</p>

<p>— (Zhang Mengfei)</p>
<p>The play "Si Lang Visits His Mother" is known to be the forte of Tan Xinpei, but after careful examination of the plot, it is not appropriate. When Yang Yanhui married Xiao Bang, which is now Beiping, Tianbo Mansion, where the general lives, was in Tokyo, which is now Henan. The two places are separated by more than a thousand miles, and Si Lang was able to steal the order to leave the customs in one night, see his mother, wife, brothers, nephews, and nieces, and still return to the customs to hand over the order. It went through many twists and turns. Even if there is an airplane to take today, it is beyond reach. I would like to point out this absurdity to your Eminence.</p>

<h3 id="e195">Yangzhou Idle Talk <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Born in the Jia Chen Year</p>
<p>"Yangzhou Idle Talk" is intended to distinguish it from Yi Junzuo's "Idle Talk about Yangzhou." Moreover, what is written in this article is authentic, genuine Yangzhou idle talk, truly snow tracks and goose tracks from a trip to Yangzhou.</p>
<p>"With a hundred thousand strings of cash around his waist, he rides a crane to Yangzhou," this is the grand gesture of the ancients. Although I, a poor scholar, do not have a hundred thousand strings of cash to spend on travels, my ambition is no less than that of the ancients. Thus, in the early autumn season, I took a steamer down to Yangzhou to visit this place known for its bright moon. I fulfilled a long-cherished wish.</p>
<p>Yangzhou is not only the most important port in Jiangbei, but it has also recently been specially designated by the government as a residential area. Important figures who want to live here are now arriving in droves. The current environment of Yangzhou still retains a simple and unsophisticated charm amidst civilization and enlightenment, making it a truly desirable place to live.</p>
<p>Although the famous scenic spots of Yangzhou cannot be compared with the world-renowned Suzhou and Hangzhou, places such as Slender West Lake, Pingshan Hall, and Green Willow Village are indeed worth lingering over. Moreover, they are purely natural landscapes, with absolutely no artificial intrusions, capturing the spirit of nature. It is this simplicity, tranquility, and elegance that surpasses other places.</p>
<p>The transportation of Yangzhou is extremely smooth, both by water and land. Since the construction of highways throughout Jiangsu Province, it has become even more convenient. Currently, in addition to the Yangzhou-Zhenjiang bus and the connection with the Nanjing-Shanghai Railway train, there are also long-distance buses to Xuzhou and Haizhou in the north, Tianchang in the west, and Nanjing and Wuhu in the south. The inland river steamer routes are especially centered in Yangzhou, with Nanjing, Liuhe, Qingjiang, Gaoyou, Taizhou, Xinghua, and Tongyang routes being numerous. Yangtze River ships sailing up and down the river also stop here. Places like Huojia Bridge and Bajiang Estuary are only about ten miles from the city. If the Jiangsu Construction Department's planned eastern Jiangsu Railway (from the provincial capital to Dongtai) is completed on schedule, the city will become an even more important area.</p>
<p>Daily life in Yangzhou is extremely ordinary. Compared to Suzhou and Shanghai, it is less than half, and compared to the capital, it is only about one-third. A family of eight with an income of twenty or thirty yuan a month can live comfortably and happily without worries. Therefore, there are quite a few civil servants from the capital and provinces who move to Yangzhou to live a retired life. The reason is that renting a house with three rooms only costs two yuan a month in rent. All other daily necessities, such as fish, salt, and vegetables, are reasonably priced. It is no wonder that more and more people are coming from all directions.</p>
<p>The small eateries and restaurants in Yangzhou are particularly inexpensive and of high quality, surpassing any other place. During my short stay of more than ten days in Yangzhou, I ate out almost every meal, and the cost was equivalent to buying groceries myself. If three close friends eat together, it is even cheaper. The Rainbow Building and the China Restaurant outside the Xiaodongmen are particularly unique. Three dishes—stir-fried eel, stir-fried shrimp, and trotters soup—cost only a thousand cash, which is more than enough for four people, and each dish is extremely fresh and delicious.</p>
<p>In the past, Yangzhou flourished due to the gathering of salt merchants, which boosted the market. Now, with the northward relocation of the salt industry to Huaihai, the impact on the area is enormous, and all industries are declining. Currently, with the designation of a residential area and the increasing number of visitors, there is a sense of revival.</p>
<p>Although the development of new businesses in Yangzhou started very early, there has been no success so far. Currently, there are more than ten daily newspapers, but none of them are worth reading. The "New Jiangsu News" and "Su News" from Zhenjiang, the provincial capital, are selling well in the area. Only the "Shen Bao," "Xinwen Bao," and "Shi Bao" from Shanghai can be found. Due to convenient transportation, one can read the newspapers of the day around 5:00 PM every day. It is said that the "Central Daily News" from the capital also arrives daily.</p>

<h3 id="e196">Finance: Gold Market Trends Turn Peaceful, Foreign Exchange Market Still Dry Despite Easing, Low Price Easily Returns, Continuing to Rise One Yuan and Four <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The gold market was extremely peaceful yesterday, with the situation fluctuating. Although the foreign exchange market eased, it could not help the dryness of the market. Therefore, although major players appeared to be watching from the sidelines, many parties were disposing of holdings. As a result, prices still rose slightly. Early in the morning, with the overseas silver market showing a slight contraction in England and flat in the United States, it was said that after the market closed, there was a large number of buyers according to the listings, but a lack of sellers. The price of forward silver in Montreal fell by varying amounts from 2.5 to 3.5 cents. The exchange rate fluctuated. Over-the-counter preparatory transactions opened, initially calling for 95.6 yuan, but Dadecheng, Dada, Fuxingyong immediately sold to 3 yuan. Hengyu, Chunyuan, Yongda, Dada took advantage of the low to reach beyond 4 yuan. Dadecheng, Fuxingyong continued to sell and then declined. Later, with Dada, Hengyu, Shenfeng, Huixiang, etc. entering, it rose to 5 yuan. After opening, due to the announcement of the Central Bank's listing, England was flat and the United States contracted.

The foreign exchange market was slack, and selling pressure remained strong. With advance knowledge of the HSBC Bank's listing, England was flat and so on, contracting by 0.0625. After this, it gradually fell slightly, and the situation was mediocre. However, buyers were active when they saw low prices, and the prices gradually rose after the low point. At one point, the situation improved, but the lack of activity among Chinese merchants kept the foreign exchange market flat. Sellers took advantage of the high prices to sell off, and the prices fell again. Only the balance of supply and demand could be maintained. The prediction for Indian silver was a contraction of 4 annas. At noon, the market hesitated. In the afternoon, the market was still stable. The bank's selling appetite did not abate, and Sassoon also clogged. Sellers became eager and moved downstream. The Indian silver telegram reported a contraction of 2 annas, which had no impact. Later, with HSBC selling off at one point, the domestic market hardened, and prices gradually declined. The Indian silver secondary report was flat, which still had no impact. Buyers took advantage of the low prices to become active, and the market finally tightened. Finally, it was pulled up again. The overall trend for the day fluctuated, and it was still difficult to turn around. However, the spot market suddenly became soft. The swap spread yesterday was actually posted by the long side at 5 yuan. After recording the market situation for the day,</p>

<p>The afternoon market opened at 894 yuan, 4 jiao and 9 jiao, then became 4 yuan and 8 jiao. Hengyu, Yifengyong, Yongdelai entered, rising to 6 yuan and 1 jiao. Huixiang, Dadecheng, Yongli, Dadecheng, Dada, Changda, Hengyu all sold, Datong had already clogged the November US dollar at 825, and thus stepped downstream. Although Indian silver contracted by 2.2.2 annas, it still fell to 4 yuan and 3 jiao. Dadecheng took advantage of the low to take in, rising to 4 yuan and 9 jiao. Sassoon clogged shillings and remained flat. HSBC clogged the October shilling at 125, Hengyu, Dingkang, Fuxingyong sold to 1 yuan and 3 jiao.

Tianjin goods were increased by 6 yuan and 5 jiao, and cooked red goods were increased by 8 yuan. Both lacked transactions. The swap spread was given by various parties, Hengchangyong posted to Qianchangxiang 217, rising to 5 yuan. Presumably, it was related to the approaching silver root of delivery. The long side had difficulty coping.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was mediocre. In summary, Dadecheng, Dingkang, Hengyu, Tianfeng, Fengtong, Fengheng, Qianchangxiang, Xianghe, Hongxing, Dacheng, Shunmao, etc. were on the selling side. Huixiang, Hengchangyong, Fuyu, Yuanmao, Yongju, Dada, Tongfu, Fuyong, Dachang, Xiangfeng, Changjia, Runlifeng, Lichangyongli, Dafa, Yongwanfeng, Shunli, etc. were on the buying side.

<p>Yesterday, the November term futures of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange started in the market. The trading was still thin. As a result, four or five types still failed to open. The atmosphere among the groups was leisurely, and the buying and selling were both dispensable. The market price remained stagnant. The 96 transactions were also relatively few, and the long side had swaps, so the one and a half jiao fall in this month was also the champion of the entire number. The environment was silent, and the market price was also without stretch. The dark clouds did not rain, and speculators were still afraid to use it. The speed of change is not far away. Yesterday's experience was completely floating in the five-point market price, and the one-jiao rise and fall was already rare and valuable. The November term futures market was also not as active as before. With the sale of 96 by the North Gang, the market atmosphere suddenly became depressed, and there were very few consumers. As a result, the market price saw mixed gains and losses, and the number was only five points and one jiao. The 96 were down one and a half jiao. The total number of transactions was 3,845,000 yuan. Here is a comparative list of the results of the gains and losses (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan):</p>

<p>In the spot yarn pre-market opening, each month showed a slight decline again. The trading in the market was not prosperous, and most of them held a hopeful attitude.

<p>The cotton market is still firm. Because the Ningbo gang is covering the short, the Jin gang is also coming to pull in, so the market is becoming tighter. However, foreign cotton is still seeping secretly, and people's hearts can still be balanced. The factory's needs have not been fully developed.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, each month was 3 to 6 pounds of sound, the trading was stagnant, and the price was because there was a lack of delivery notices for the October term. The industry and the Far East bought at a limited price. Texas had rain, and California had a storm, which was very stable. After that, there was a gradual sale, and the long side of the previous month's term settled, and it was slightly tired. There were not many transactions by people outside the industry. The industry was waiting for the progress of Europe. The current demand has improved, and the factory's need for cotton is very eager, and the need for textiles is also smooth. The closing was stable, the spot price did not move, and the futures fell by 1 to 5 pounds of sound. British cotton spot fell by one point, and futures fell by two or three points.

<p>Yesterday, the flour market fell across the board. Because of the quotation of foreign wheat, Chicago rose by 2 to 4 jiao, and Canada fell by 5 jiao. People's hearts in the market are in a state of tension in the international situation, and it seems that the game has been abandoned. For a while, it will not become a reality. The Fuxin shutdown is related to a part, and the factory's inventory is still sufficient to meet the current needs. With these various situations, people's hearts are depressed, and transactions have also turned quiet. The price fell by 1 to 2 points. By the time the afternoon market opened, it was still calm, but the September and October markets were quite tight due to the relationship between hedging. The price was slightly better. The long-term manufacturers did not come out, and the long side was not finished watching, and it was also slightly better.

<p>Yesterday's term wheat market, the market in the morning and afternoon openings, the market in each month was generally flat at first and then fell. Because the foreign wheat rose and fell, the foreign situation seemed to be watching, so the hearts of people in the market were not as enthusiastic as at the beginning of the week. This month is the last day, with little ups and downs at first, and so is the long-term. Later, because the long side came back, it was already weak. By the time of each market in the afternoon, the long side in this month was all outsiders, and there was a tendency to kill more, so the market gradually became disgusted. The lowest was 8 jiao and 6 points, and the October rate once fell to 8 yuan and 2 points. Then the market players' short side took the opportunity to smoothly make up, and then rebounded. As a result, this month fell by 5 points, and the long-term only fell by 1 to 3 points.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, each gang's source of goods increased significantly, with over forty arrivals (totaling more than eight thousand piculs). The market continued to show weakness. Some buyers from Qingdao and Yantai still took about a thousand packages, but due to oversupply, picking was strict and there was little variety. Early price drops occurred in the southern port, with minor scale deviations. Various thin rice types also saw price declines of several cents to nearly a dime. However, the Suzhou and Tong rice types remained stable due to a lack of goods. Newly harvested river rice fell by varying amounts of one to two dimes. Factory-new rice maintained its position due to accumulated thin stocks. New, high-quality rice from areas like Luyang and Xinchuan experienced uneven sales, with prices dropping by another dime or so. Old, white Yuan rice remained flat and sluggish.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the price of foreign rice remained firm, as suppliers consistently held their ground. Even rice that was floating or returned from other ports was not sold at a lower price. Stockpilers remained quietly waiting for opportunities, while smaller stockpilers showed considerable interest. As a result, even without customer demand, the market remained firm. A total of over 1,600 bags of Saigon rice and 400 bags of Xiaojiao rice were sold throughout the day, all of which were handled by local businesses. 100 bags of rice flour were sent to the interior. Prices were similar to those of the previous market.</p>

Approximately 800 bags of Ningbo rice, 70 bags of Anqing white rice, and 250 bags of Nanjing and Jiangbei rice were involved.

<p>Recently, firms from Tianjin such as Daxincheng, Wanfengtai, and others have been actively purchasing black iron sheets. Market conditions are very tight.

According to a reporter's investigation, future shipments are very scarce. Those holding goods are very bullish and expect market prices to continue to rise.

<h3 id="e219">The Journey from Rousseau to Babbitt <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Jicong</p>
<p>If Bacon is the founder of modern science, then Rousseau can be said to be the founder of modern thought that arose with the Renaissance. Rousseau's individualism and liberalism not only had a great impact on politics and general thought, but also had a great influence on literature. Rousseau himself was a literary writer, and in his general treatises and so-called argumentative novels, one can see his literary views combined with the aforementioned thoughts. He replaced the humanism of classicism with the development of individuality; he opposed the rules and rationality of classicism, advocating the liberation of emotions and allowing them to run freely. If the thought of absolutist classicism is static thought, then we can say that Rousseau's thought, which opposed classicism, is dynamic thought. He was a person who lived a dynamic and wandering life; and, according to his own account, he was also someone who believed that the body and limbs were opposed by emotions and imagination.</p>
<p>Such literary thought of Rousseau is, in fact, the entire ideological system of Romanticism. Many literary historians say that Rousseau is the founder of Romanticism, which is not an exaggeration. If Romanticism is a literary trend of thought produced by the emerging industrial citizens in order to break the shackles that hindered them from building their own literature, then Rousseau, the founder of Romanticism, can also be said to be the literary vanguard and the pioneer of modern literature for the industrial citizens.</p>
<p>However, in the eighteenth century, industrial citizens were in a period of rising prosperity. At that time, in order to obtain the right to free trade, to oppose the rule of the aristocracy, and to step onto the political stage, they actively advocated freedom and democracy, promoted individualism, and liberated emotions. The so-called Rousseau's thought is a reflection of the thought of the industrial citizens of the eighteenth century. In the nineteenth century, although there were many changes in modern citizen literature, their literature showed the development from Romanticism to Realism, but because they were still growing upward at that time, they had not fundamentally betrayed the initial thought represented by Rousseau. However, as time progressed to the twentieth century, those who do not move cannot activate their brains. He once said: "When I am in one place, I can hardly think of anything; for my mental activity, my physical activity is necessary." Therefore, he often traveled, moved, and wandered around. His whole life can be said to be a dynamic life. Combined with this dynamic life is his dynamic thought: resisting reality, opposing artificiality, advocating nature, and demanding freedom. Because he hated reality and loved nature, Rousseau also valued imagination. He was particularly critical of the rationality and rules of classicism. Especially on the eve of the Great War, modern society showed its morbidity and crisis in all aspects, and all objective facts proved that it had reached the end of the road given to it by history. Therefore, the citizens, the masters of modern society, felt that Rousseau's thought was not only useless but also harmful to them. Therefore, calls against Rousseau's thought came from all directions. Professor Babbitt's so-called humanism emerged from this.</p>
<p>Professor Babbitt's humanism, on the surface, seems to be a revival of classicism in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but in fact it has new significance. This new significance lies in the fact that it is a product of the time around the Great War. In Professor Babbitt's view, the many dangerous social phenomena and even the brutal wars that occurred in the twentieth century were all led by Bacon's materialism and Rousseau's liberalism. Therefore, in order to avoid war and eliminate all dangerous social phenomena, he replaced the "law of matter" with the "law of human affairs," and replaced liberalism with teaching people to "follow the rules" and "not go to extremes." If people really listened to this and everyone "followed the rules" and "did not go to extremes," then the world would be peaceful and the modern society that had reached the end of its road could last forever. However, undesirable things continued to happen, and Babbitt's humanism did not show a great effect. Therefore, Professor Babbitt had no choice but to further beg for mercy from God and religion. He publicly stated that in order to maintain the status quo, he had to ask Buddha and Jesus to come out.</p>
<p>In literature, Professor Babbitt and his disciples completely agreed with the theory of classicism.</p>
<p>The literary trend of classicism existed in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, and Professor Babbitt's humanistic literary thought was the thought of classical righteousness; in this sense, we can say that it is a kind of retro thought. At the same time, if Rousseau was the spokesperson for the rising industrial citizens, and Babbitt's doctrine was a reflection of the thought of the citizens who had embarked on the road, then we can also say that Babbitt's doctrine is a kind of citizen thought that has developed to the final stage. Because the modern citizens who have reached the end of their road need to go back to the past and revive classicism in order to preserve their last life, so Professor Babbitt's humanism was produced. Here, there is the unity of the so-called citizen thought that has developed to the final stage and the retro thought.</p>
<p>Rousseau's thought is the initial citizen thought, so it is forward-looking; Babbitt's doctrine is the citizen thought that has embarked on the road to decline, so it is backward-looking. From Rousseau's thought to Professor Babbitt's humanism, it is a process of how modern citizen thought arose, developed, and declined.</p>

<p>— Chu Yaming</p>
<p>(A girl who doesn't listen to her mother)</p>
<p>When I was a child, I often heard adults say two sentences that they liked to say.</p>
<p>"Do you want to be A-Sheng?"</p>
<p>"No A-Xiang, no A-Sheng!"</p>
<p>Why they liked these two sentences so much, as if they were an important part of a complete life, was something that I found difficult to explain at first. They judged that a girl was really bold and reckless, or naughty and mischievous, or even a little disobedient to her elders, and scolded:</p>
<p>"Do you want to be A-Sheng?"</p>
<p>Later, I finally heard the story of A-Sheng, the girl who didn't listen to her mother, from my old aunt's narration. Her expression was so reverent and solemn, as if she was talking about the legend of a god.</p>
<p>"Yongchang Silk Factory was the largest silk factory in Guixiang, with nine lanes in the whole factory, two boats in each lane, and fifty seats in each boat, a total of as many as nine hundred female workers." The old aunt closed her eyes and sadly described the prosperous days of the past. "As you can imagine, naturally there was a male inspector in each lane. They were used to check whether the female workers were being lazy, walking around idly all day long, talking to the female workers when they were happy. Some girls wanted to curry favor with them, some wanted to use them to relieve boredom, but some 'infected' girls didn't even look at them. However, if this was the case, they would be ashamed and angry, and would insist that you were doing rough work and immediately 'collect your cocoons' and not allow you to work. They were all afraid of those inspectors.</p>
<p>"The inspector in charge of the first lane was a man called Xiang-ge. One day he noticed a new young female worker who was very beautiful, and none of the female workers in the whole factory could compare to her; but she didn't say a word all day, obediently lowering her head to work. Xiang-ge patrolled around her incessantly, trying to talk to her, but seeing that she always kept her mouth shut, he became even more anxious and impatient, making the girls next to her envious and jealous. She was A-Sheng.</p>
<p>"A-Xiang immediately found out that A-Sheng only had a very old mother, that she was very filial to her, and listened to everything she said, and that they were very poor. A-Xiang made up his mind and went straight to her mother to discuss everything. A-Sheng herself didn't know why, but she was suddenly promoted from a junior apprentice to a second apprentice. It wasn't easy to be a first apprentice at that time, hum, she earned six dimes a day!</p>
<p>"On the evening of Deyang Festival, A-Sheng's mother made a table of dishes herself, bought a lot of wine, and invited A-Xiang to dinner. A-Sheng got drunk and didn't know anything. It was a bit of a sin, and her mother left A-Xiang to sleep in the same bed with A-Sheng!</p>
<p>"Later, when A-Sheng found out what had happened to her, she quarreled with her mother. Alas, they started fighting, and that unfilial girl injured her mother, smashing her eyes and head with something. The next day, A-Sheng abandoned her mother and fled to the provincial capital, and the following year, her mother died."</p>
<p>"Didn't you say that her mother was a bit sinful?" I protested.</p>
<p>"Sinful is sinful, what's there to say! Even if she cut her into pieces or ate her, she would still be her mother! A mother can give birth to her, so it's okay to tell her to die; besides, a mother has complete control over marriage matters."</p>
<p>But I knew that my old aunt was lying to me, that she must have been hiding something and didn't want to tell me, because what she said was extremely inconsistent and contradictory with the regretful and respectful expression she had when she spoke.</p>
<p>I ran to ask the shaman Zhong Dao-yi, who could write charms, treat illnesses, drive away ghosts, and secure families, a poor and sickly old drunkard who often ran to our door and beat our two big wooden doors or lay down in the middle of the street to sleep when he was drunk.</p>
<p>"Your aunt will scold me, she won't give me a single copper!"</p>
<p>"But why do you say 'No A-Xiang, no A-Sheng' when you encounter bad luck or someone bullies you? Do you like being A-Sheng?"</p>
<p>"Don't talk nonsense, you little devil!" He scolded me like this, but he was actually very happy, so he continued with his incomplete words!</p>
<p>"I mean, those who want to destroy my whole family, their intention to harm me may instead fulfill me. They want me to suffer losses, but they may instead let me take advantage! A-Sheng lives in everyone's heart and is immortal...</p>
<p>"The year after her mother died, A-Sheng, this comet, returned to Guixiang. When she left, she was a silk worker', but when she came back, she became a free woman, a female student, a queen!... No one dared to mention the past except herself. She dared to, and often brought it up in front of the old masters and local gentry, embarrassing them... At that time, they couldn't even smile in front of her... What could they do? The local self-defense army listened to her, the county magistrate often invited her to tea, she wore a horse, and ran around the streets with many men, and no one dared to provoke those men!</p>
<p>"At first, when A-Xiang heard that A-Sheng had come to Guixiang, he prepared to run away secretly in the middle of the night, but he didn't succeed and was escorted back by several self-defense soldiers. Those self-defense soldiers all knew about their past, and they pushed him in front of A-Sheng and said: "Sister Sheng, do you still remember him? He is A-Xiang, who used to be an inspector and is now doing housework and has a wife. Would you like to treat him to something to eat?" "Okay, let me see clearly, untie the rope!" She walked up to him; whipped him a few times with her riding crop, then told people to take him to the military court.</p>
<p>They sentenced him to labor, washing horses, carrying bullets, picking mulberry leaves on the mulberry field from morning till night, and the wages he earned were confiscated. A-Xiang, who was used to being pampered, couldn't stand it, and what he couldn't stand even more was that the female workers who picked mulberry leaves ridiculed their new partner all day long, singing songs and scolding him... So one night, he hanged himself in the stable.</p>
<p>The day after many women followed her example and paraded in white shirts and black skirts on the street, I met her. She sat in my house for a long time, talking about many things from the past... "Don't be a shaman, in the future no one will believe you and your spells, and you will slowly starve to death! Go to me and find something else to do." She said this to me and gave me a piece of paper.</p>
<p>"But I didn't go to her. I was a little afraid of her, and I knew that they didn't like me, or they would ask me to do hard labor, and I couldn't stand hardship even more than A-Xiang.</p>
<p>"But what this comet said finally came true, and now, am I not slowly starving to death? However, she said that people would not believe me, that is not right. People believe me, more than ever before, only they have no money; they can't afford to ask me to perform spells?"</p>

<p>— Hu Yifan</p>
<p>In a canal with green algae, a fisherman had been submerged in the water for quite some time.</p>
<p>The canal was less than five or six zhang long and about two zhang wide, but it was the source of filth and dirt for the people of this village. Apart from drinking water, which they could draw buckets of muddy water from a public well without a lid or walls, they relied on this small canal for everything from washing rice and vegetables, laundering clothes, to emptying chamber pots.</p>
<p>At this moment, piles of people were squatting on both sides of the small canal.</p>
<p>Slap, slap, slap, the laundry sticks fell one after another, and the women's talk never stopped. The interesting thing was talking about A-San's divorce:</p>
<p>"How could A-San agree to such a thing?"</p>
<p>"Doesn't agree? What can A-San take to support his family?"</p>
<p>"He would only agree to a divorce if there was no other way to think of, right? Mother?"</p>
<p>"That's right. It's really hard to be a man these days. You can't find work, and there's no other way out. What can you do if your wife has an affair? If a man doesn't want to be a cuckold, a woman won't succeed if she doesn't find a way to make a living herself; that's for sure."</p>
<p>At this point, everyone looked at the old woman's摇头咕嘴, confident expression and stopped their hands involuntarily and laughed. However, this laughter seemed so indifferent and powerless!</p>
<p>"This can only be blamed on the bad market! A-San is such a diligent young man, how could he get divorced if he didn't lose his job? I heard that A-San wanted to… to… commit suicide…"</p>
<p>Before Yun Di's mother, with the rotten eyelids, could finish speaking, a gunshot rang out from the fence by the roadside, and the sparrows flew up in fright. Immediately, a Werther-like youth in a Western-style jacket and riding breeches appeared there, holding a red-handled black air gun, standing there arrogantly, looking around for his target.</p>
<p>They gasped, their chests pounding, and each of them spat lightly.</p>
<p>"So scary, so scary, damn animal!" The language immediately became so weak, almost inaudible.</p>
<p>Then there was silence. Experience told them that even young masters were coming out to take walks and hunt, so it was getting late. So they started doing their work even more frantically.</p>
<p>The world had obviously changed. Although this was a village and this was a morning, people had long lost their previous leisure and become more tired, and life had become more cramped.</p>
<p>In the fields, the songs of shepherd boys and the chants of famous scholars could no longer be heard, only sighs and cries of hardship. Even they knew: divorce, unemployment, suicide… this series of new terms!</p>
<p>The beginning of the day unfolded a bleak and gloomy world! (End)</p>

<p>At this time, the pastor slowly raised his head and glanced at the patient from afar: the emaciated face was covered with large black scars. Long, messy hair. The eyes were stretching upwards. The chest seemed to be still trembling slightly.</p>
<p>"Well, then," Dr. Lan took out a notebook, "How old are you?"</p>
<p>"Thirty… one years old." The patient murmured, and suddenly, the upward-stretching eyeballs glared, "Sir, please… you… don't need to treat… me… my… illness… is… not… curable…"</p>
<p>Dr. Lan was busy calling the nurse to make a phone call:</p>
<p>"Remember, Phialon Mortuary. (Immediately he turned his head again.) What's your name?"</p>
<p>"Lu… Chang… Sheng."</p>
<p>Dr. Lan closed the notebook and looked at his watch - it was already ten twenty-five. He hurried over to press the elevator bell - zzzz.</p>
<p>The pastor stood like a stone at the door of the emergency room, his thick eyebrows huddled together, his eyes shooting anger at the patient like fire, and the thunderous throat sound rang again:</p>
<p>"You are Lu Changsheng!"</p>
<p>"Yes!" The patient was startled, and immediately an unbearable pain lowered his voice, "Old… sir… thank… you!</p>
<p>"Where is your money! Where is your money! One dollar!"</p>
<p>"Thank… you… old… sir… a few… dimes… to eat… the rest… all… bought… lightning… medicine… I… last… time… in… the hospital… heard someone say… this… medicine… is… the most effective… but… it's… painful… old… sir…"</p>
<p>"Bah!" The pastor jumped up in a hurry, immediately took his bag and left, pressing the elevator bell next to the door violently, zzzz, zzzz! He wiped his nose with a handkerchief in a panic, muttering: "The Chinese are not working animals, they are stupid worms in hell!"</p>
<p>The elevator went up. The emergency room was as silent as death. Only the pale electric light reflected the crystal tears of the suicide victim, and the early autumn wind flew in from the window, blowing the white cloth on his slightly undulating chest to tremble slightly. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e224">Gonococcal Orchitis <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>After contracting gonorrhea, the causative agent, the gonococcus bacteria, immediately invades the urethra through the urethral opening. Initially, the gonorrhea infection is superficial, residing in the anterior urethra, where it first manifests as acute gonorrhea. At this stage, promptly taking the specific anti-gonorrhea medication "Miesha Lin" (滅殺淋) internally and applying "Lindu Shuyier" (淋毒舒藥耳) externally will swiftly eradicate the gonococcus, leading to a complete cure. However, if treatment is delayed or improperly administered, failing to eliminate the gonococcus thoroughly, the gonorrhea may not be eradicated. The gonococcus then gradually invades the posterior urethra, transitioning from subacute to chronic gonorrhea. Subsequently, it may invade the bladder, causing cystitis, or the prostate gland, leading to prostatitis, and eventually spread to the testicles, resulting in gonococcal orchitis and other associated complications of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>When the gonococcus invades the posterior urethra from the anterior urethra and then proceeds through the seminal colliculus and vas deferens to the testicles, causing gonococcal orchitis, the swelling of the testicles is often mistaken for a hernia (小腸氣). However, hernias are caused by the descent of the small intestine from the abdominal cavity into the scrotum, a condition medically termed "prolapse of the intestine," which is distinctly different from gonococcal orchitis. Gonococcal orchitis is solely caused by the invasion of the gonococcus into the testicles, resulting in inflammation, and is a complication of gonorrhea.</p>
<p>In the early stages of gonococcal orchitis, a pulling sensation is felt in the groin area. One of the testicles in the scrotum gradually develops a sensation of heaviness and swelling, accompanied by a severe, stabbing pain. The pain gradually progresses to redness and swelling, and the scrotum also becomes swollen and painful, eventually becoming significantly enlarged, sometimes more than half its original size. This makes movement difficult and walking becomes challenging. The condition may be bearable while lying down, but upon standing, it feels as if a very heavy object is hanging from the groin. Coughing exacerbates the pain, and the patient may also experience high fever and extreme fatigue. After about half a month, the redness and swelling may subside, but a hard mass will inevitably form. Once this mass forms, it cannot be eliminated quickly. Therefore, upon contracting gonorrhea, prompt treatment is crucial to eradicate the gonococcus thoroughly and prevent it from spreading to the testicles and causing severe conditions like gonococcal orchitis. This is the best course of action. (Editor's note: The Chun Zai Hospital (春在醫院) at 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession offers highly reliable gonorrhea treatment. The hospital is equipped with comprehensive facilities, including shortwave diathermy equipment for treating gonorrhea. The fees are exceptionally low, and the results are remarkably rapid, making it a boon for gonorrhea sufferers. Furthermore, for internal gonorrhea medication, "Miesha Lin" (滅殺淋) is considered the most effective, while for external treatment, "Lindu Shuyier" (淋毒舒藥耳) is the top choice. Both are sold by Renshou Pharmacy (仁壽西藥社) at 1 Old Dexing Lane, Mintini Road. Major pharmacies like Nanyang, Wing On, and Sincere also carry these products. Gonorrhea sufferers should not miss this opportunity.)</p>
<h3 id="e225">Nocturnal Emission, Premature Ejaculation, and An Er Shen (安彌神) <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Cui Fuqing</p>
<p>Nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation are both types of neurasthenia. They are primarily caused by masturbation and excessive sexual activity. Excessive masturbation and sexual activity deplete the body of semen, causing excessive consumption and a decline in endocrine fluids, which leads to neurasthenia. This results in conditions like nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation, which develop gradually. The reason for this is that the nervous system governing sexual desire and the central nervous system become highly sensitive and easily stimulated, leading to the rapid ejaculation of semen, resulting in nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation. Human semen is extremely precious, originating from the testicles. Through the function of the epididymis, it enters the seminal vesicle walls via the vas deferens. A portion flows into the lymphatic vessels and then into the blood vessels, circulating in the bloodstream as nourishment. Another portion returns to the testicles via the arteries, reforming into semen and completing the semen circulation. Excessive nocturnal emission, masturbation, and sexual activity all deplete semen. The physiological production of new blood cannot replenish the loss, gradually depleting the brain, spinal cord, and nervous system, leading to neurasthenia and subsequently premature ejaculation, as well as various other diseases caused by this condition, such as brain diseases, stomach diseases, sexual organ diseases, and heart diseases. Therefore, nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation can be the root cause of various diseases, potentially endangering life and should not be ignored. The causes of nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation are primarily excessive discharge leading to insufficient nourishment of the nervous system, reproductive organs, and endocrine system. The treatment method should focus on supplementing the body's endocrine fluids and replenishing essential substances for the nervous system, particularly phosphorus. "An Er Shen" (安爾神) is a highly reliable endocrine phosphorus preparation that has a special and remarkable effect on the treatment of neurasthenia and is also an effective medicine for treating nocturnal emission and premature ejaculation.</p>
<h3 id="e226">Female Infertility and Gonorrhea <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Xuan</p>
<p>Female infertility can be divided into two categories: infertility due to natural physiological defects and infertility due to illness. Infertility due to physiological defects is rare, with most cases being due to illness. There are various causes of female infertility, but infertility caused by gonorrhea is the most common and prevalent. Medical studies have shown that gonorrhea accounts for 60-70% of female infertility cases. Therefore, gonorrhea has a significant impact on female fertility.</p>
<p>In men, the gonococcus initially invades the urethra. In women, it first invades the vaginal cavity and uterus. When the gonococcus invades the vaginal cavity, it causes vaginitis. After invading the uterus, it inevitably causes endometritis and metritis, which often lead to infertility. Gonorrhea can also cause changes in the position of the uterus, which is a major cause of infertility.</p>
<p>In women with gonorrhea, the gonococcus can spread from the uterus to the fallopian tubes, causing salpingitis and abscesses. The fallopian tubes may even become completely blocked, leading to absolute infertility. Further progression to the ovaries can cause oophoritis, hindering egg maturation and preventing ovulation, which also leads to infertility. Additionally, gonorrhea can cause tumors in the uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes, as well as changes in the position of the uterus, all of which can lead to female infertility. Another major cause of infertility in women with gonorrhea is that the activity of sperm ejaculated by men is destroyed by the gonococcus in the vaginal cavity, naturally leading to infertility. Therefore, if gonorrhea in women is not cured, it will inevitably hinder fertility and cut off the family line, which is a matter of great importance.</p>
<p>If a woman contracts gonorrhea but the gonococcus has not yet deeply invaded the uterus, external treatment with "Lindu Shuyier" (淋毒舒樂耳) can completely eliminate the gonococcus in the vaginal cavity. If the gonococcus has invaded the uterus, internal medication with "Miesha Lin" (滅殺淋) should be used as the primary treatment to eradicate the gonococcus and cure the gonorrhea, preventing it from leading to infertility.</p>
<h3 id="e227">Talking About Tinea <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Sun Zhiyao</p>
<p>Tinea is a skin disease that is highly contagious. Patients often experience recurring episodes. Without effective dermatological medications, it is extremely difficult to eradicate. The source of tinea is usually through transmission. Professionals such as doctors and nurses, due to the nature of their work, have frequent skin contact with patients, making them susceptible to transmission. Privileged individuals with weakened skin resistance are also prone to transmission. Farmers exposed to sun and rain are susceptible to skin diseases of the head and face. Butchers and shepherds who come into contact with livestock often develop ringworm. Carpenters and shoemakers, who constantly work with calluses, are prone to rashes or eczema. Those living on the water, due to constant exposure to moisture, are particularly prone to various stubborn tineas.</p>
<p>Diet also has a close relationship with tinea. People who enjoy drinking alcohol are more likely to develop "wine tinea." Those who consume spicy foods are also more prone to tinea.</p>
<p>Climate also plays a role in tinea. In humid and hot regions, eczema and miliaria are prevalent in spring and autumn. In winter, lichen simplex chronicus and prurigo nodularis are common. In summer, pityriasis versicolor, rashes, and tinea versicolor are prevalent. Other types of tinea, such as ichthyosis and keratoderma, are not only infectious but also hereditary.</p>
<p>Age also affects the type of tinea that develops. Tinea in children is often characterized by pigmented measles, ichthyosis, and other conditions. Middle-aged individuals are more prone to intertrigo and athlete's foot. Elderly individuals are more likely to develop seborrheic keratosis and epithelioma. The type of tinea varies with age.</p>
<p>In addition to the above, there are countless types of stubborn tinea. However, the cause is always transmission. All types of tinea are caused by the invasion of microorganisms into the skin. Once these microorganisms are transmitted, tinea immediately develops. This is why tinea is so contagious and difficult to eradicate. Only by completely eliminating the microorganisms can the condition be cured. Current treatment methods using artificial sunlamps and quartz mercury lamps have surprisingly effective results. For external medication, "Jiejue Jun" (潔絕菌), sold by Renshou Pharmacy (仁壽西藥社) on Old Dexing Lane, Mintini Road, is considered the best. It can treat various stubborn tineas and effectively eliminate tinea.</p>
<h3 id="e228">The Scope and Miraculous Effects of "Wei Bao" (胃寶) in Treating Stomach Disorders <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Cui Zhongbin</p>
<p>Stomach disorders are not limited to the stomach itself. Many symptoms can be related to the stomach, causing stomach pain. However, most stomach pain is caused by stomach disorders. Stomach pain caused by gastric ulcers and duodenal ulcers is closely related to diet. The pain occurs when hungry and can be alleviated by eating a reasonable amount of food. The pain comes and goes. In addition to pain, there are often symptoms such as hematemesis, acid reflux, and black stools. This type of stomach disorder is the most common.</p>
<p>Some stomach pain is caused by neurasthenia and is a type of neurotic stomach pain. There are no ulcers in the stomach. The pain can be very severe. This is also a type of stomach disorder. Stomach cancer is also a stomach disorder. It is very difficult to treat and can be life-threatening. However, if detected early, it is not an incurable disease. Stomach pain caused by stomach cancer is usually continuous. The pain occurs when hungry and when full. Sometimes, a hard mass can be felt in the stomach. This type of stomach disorder is the most dangerous.</p>
<p>Other diseases such as cholecystitis and acute gastritis can also cause stomach pain. However, the location and nature of the pain vary.</p>

<p>Answer: Based solely on your description, we cannot make a definitive diagnosis. It is most likely bronchial asthma. For effective medication for this condition, such as ephedrine and calcium iodide, Dr. She Lei is a specialist in internal medicine and can provide a consultation.</p>
<p>Damaging Appearance</p>
<p>(Mr. Yang Tiannan asks) I am 28 years old, unmarried, and generally healthy. I have no venereal diseases. However, for the past year, I have been losing a lot of hair every morning when I comb my hair, almost to the point of balding, which is damaging my appearance. I don't know what medicine I can apply or take to promote hair regrowth. I earnestly request your advice so that I can follow it.</p>
<p>Answer: Your condition is likely caused by tinea favosa. Please try purchasing and applying "Miejue Jun" (滅絕菌).</p>
<p>Restless Sitting and Lying</p>
<p>I respectfully state that I suffered from inflammation in the perineal area last year. I scratched off the skin and applied ointment for two or three days, and it healed. Now it has recurred and has become so severe that I cannot sit or lie down for even a moment. Applying the ointment is no longer effective. Please have your consultants advise me in the newspaper. - Mu Zheng</p>
<p>Answer: Please try purchasing and applying "Miejue Jun" (滅絕菌). The medicine is sold by Renshou Pharmacy (仁壽西藥社) at 1 Old Dexing Lane, Mintini Road, in the French Concession, and each box costs one yuan.</p>

<p>— Physician She Lei</p>
<p>Prolonged use of morphine or opium, either as medication or as a habit, will gradually lead to addiction. Eventually, tolerance develops, and only a large dose can be effective. The most addictive method is subcutaneous injection of morphine, followed by smoking opium with a lamp. The reason why people develop tolerance to large doses of morphine or opium is that their bodies become more efficient at breaking down morphine. At the same time, the functions of various organs change to counteract the effects of morphine. Animal experiments have shown that animals accustomed to morphine have a more active morphine-degrading mechanism, even to the point where the amount of morphine excreted in its original form decreases. At this point, the animal desires morphine greatly and enters a morphine-dependent state. The more it consumes, the greater its tolerance becomes, and its craving for morphine intensifies. Over time, various health problems gradually develop, leading to chronic morphine poisoning. At this point, the visible symptoms include decreased saliva secretion, increased sweating, constricted pupils, extreme emaciation, loose skin, and digestive disorders. Initially, there is stubborn constipation, followed by diarrhea, leading to physical and mental exhaustion. The person experiences dizziness, headache, tremors in the limbs, neuralgia, insomnia, and eventually dementia and paralysis. Needless to say, for these patients, even those who have not reached this stage but are already accustomed to morphine, suddenly stopping their morphine or opium supply will trigger withdrawal symptoms. Approximately several hours after cessation, symptoms such as chills, yawning, headache, severe neuralgia, diarrhea, vomiting, and insomnia will appear. Among these, insomnia can last for several days. In more severe cases of withdrawal, the patient initially presents with manic behavior, followed by hallucinations and tremors, eventually developing full-blown psychosis. The most terrifying aspect of withdrawal is collapse, which can lead to death.</p>

<h3 id="e232">Is Bertrand Russell a Supporter of Social Darwinism? <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Paris, 19th, National Telegram: Bertrand Russell, the world-renowned political, social, economic, and philosophical thinker, told the Associated Press today that the United States cannot avoid being drawn into any European war, and that he greatly appreciates the United States' policy of seeking neutrality. However, he said that he does not believe this plan will work in the event of a war, such as the last World War, the United States initially tried to strictly maintain neutrality, but it was ineffective, because there are economic factors that make it difficult for the United States to stay out of the matter. What Italy is doing today is certainly perverse, and what Britain is doing is also very foolish. Britain should not be so strongly opposed to Italy. We must assess the facts, and we should know that Abyssinia, when viewed by Europe and the world, is not important. In the event that the war spreads, Europe and the world will be affected. For the sake of the world, it seems that we should reluctantly agree, and if necessary, we should not hesitate to sacrifice Abyssinia.</p>
<p>The Italo-Abyssinian issue has reached a dangerous point at the current stage. It is foreseeable that Mussolini may not accept the recommendations made by the Five-Nation Committee of the League of Nations, and is determined to implement his original intention to conquer Abyssinia. Therefore, the situation in East Africa, unless King Haile Selassie gives in, I am afraid there is no hope of a clear solution. Let us set this aside for the time being. However, we feel that after the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, most countries in the world have disapproved of Italy's barbarity and bullying, and sympathize with Abyssinia. In particular, a group of small and weak nations have expressed their displeasure for Abyssinia, and have given Abyssinia a lot of spiritual support. Mr. Russell, who is known as a great thinker and scholar of his generation, has actually made such a remark, which really makes people dare not believe that there is any morality and justice in the world. Is Mr. Russell a supporter of Social Darwinism?</p>
<p>According to Russell's views, the purpose is nothing more than to avoid the expansion of the war, and the intention is not necessarily bad. Naturally, when we assess the facts, Abyssinia is not important when viewed by Europe and the world, which is obvious. If Britain so strongly opposes Italy, in the event that the war spreads, Europe and the world will be affected. Therefore, for the sake of world security, not only should we reluctantly agree, but when it is absolutely necessary, we should not hesitate to sacrifice Abyssinia. Sacrificing Abyssinia is only sacrificing an unimportant country. If the war is allowed to expand, it will have a significant impact on the overall situation in the world. To resolve the Italo-Abyssinian issue, this is the most straightforward and quick solution, which is more clever and easier to implement than the plans proposed by the Three-Nation Conference and the League of Nations Conference. Mussolini, upon hearing this, will surely consider Russell as a comrade, applaud and exclaim, "It really suits my heart." However, the weak and small nations of the world will have no room to survive in the future.</p>
<p>We believe that the best way to eliminate world disputes is to stop the aggressive behavior of the strong. If we are only capable of sacrificing weak countries, it will only lead to greater chaos. Most of the international incidents arise from the strong seeking gains from the weak. Without the strong oppressing the weak, the peaceful world will rarely be disturbed. Everyone can see this fact clearly. For example, today's Italo-Abyssinian dispute, how did it arise? Is it Italy's unreasonableness, or Abyssinia's fault? To resolve this issue, sacrificing Abyssinia can indeed satisfy Italy's demands and temporarily prevent it from affecting the overall situation. However, the world in the future will have no justice to speak of. Whoever has the power can act recklessly in the world. Weak and small nations are only fit to be slaughtered. In this case, how can world peace be maintained? This is probably something that even the great thinker and scholar Bertrand Russell cannot answer.</p>

<p>— Si Quan</p>
<p>In the morning, upon rising, on my writing desk, in the purple clay vase, was a bunch of blooming crimson dahlias. The scattered newspapers and magazines on the desk were all neatly cleaned up. The gentle September sunlight streamed through the window screen and onto the desk. This small desk, usually a cat's nest that gave one a headache just looking at it, appeared so harmonious and beautiful today, so endearing.</p>
<p>I am fond of flowers and plants, but after coming to Shanghai, firstly, I was too busy with work and had no leisure for such things which outsiders might consider refined. Moreover, there was really no place to grow flowers in the cramped apartments where every inch of land was precious. However, I would occasionally buy a bunch to decorate the place when passing by a flower shop. I also have a strange quirk: I don't like flowers with strong fragrances. I prefer those with vivid colors and a faint fragrance, which is why I particularly like big flowers.</p>
<p>I'm planning to move house soon due to a job change, so I've become very lazy. Not only is my writing desk messy, but every corner of the room is filled with stuff. But when I looked away from the purple clay vase, I found that the room was a little tidier today. Perhaps my wife couldn't stand the dirtiness and took the trouble to spend some time cleaning up, I thought.</p>
<p>My wife heard me getting up and came upstairs. She pretended to be angry and said, "Lazybones, you always make it look like a pigsty a few days before moving. What will people think if friends come over?" Seeing that I was just standing there, not even washing my face, she changed her tone and said with a smile, "Hurry up and wash your face, then invite some friends over for noodles."</p>
<p>"Why?" I was surprised. Last night, my wife told me that we didn't even have enough money for the moving expenses. How could she be so extravagant as to invite guests today?</p>
<p>"It's your birthday today! You're thirty years old, and you don't even know your own birthday!"</p>
<p>When I heard this, I wanted to laugh, but seeing how excited my wife was, how she had spent the whole morning cleaning the room and tidying up the writing desk for my thirtieth birthday, and how she remembered that last year on this day, some friends happily came to our house for noodles. They said that Shanghai people celebrate the year ending in nine, so they were celebrating my birthday in advance. I wasn't particularly excited, but it wouldn't hurt to have a bowl of noodles. Twenty-nine or thirty years old...</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>But my wife thought that thirty was a significant birthday. Last year, she invited friends over for noodles, so what would it look like if it was so quiet this year? Not wanting to disappoint her, I ended up inviting a few friends over, and we had a happy day.</p>
<p>Fabricating a reason, I took a day off, considering it my thirtieth birthday. Now it's midnight, everything is quiet, and I'm sitting in front of my writing desk, gazing at the bunch of dahlias. I feel that a woman's love for her husband is all-encompassing, and that a person's birthday is a momentous occasion in their eyes. In reality, living to thirty or forty is merely a record of the time one has spent in the world. What is there to commemorate? I never remember my birthday, although when I was a child, I could wear new clothes for a day and remembered the day I was born very well. Now, the burden of the family rests on my shoulders, and I'm constantly calculating living expenses. When I think about how many days I've lived, it's actually a painful memory! But still, I am thirty years old. According to the average lifespan, I've only lived half my life. There are so many more birthdays to come. But how will I spend each of the remaining days? Perhaps like those dahlias, which are now blooming so brightly, but whose lives will be immediately taken by the purple clay vase. Maybe they'll be thrown into the garbage before I even move. Isn't human life just as fleeting? Then why bother remembering one's birthday?</p>
<h3 id="e234">Hometown <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Da</p>
<p>Main Street</p>
<p>After a war and years of disasters, Main Street was clearly in decline, devoid of vitality. When I returned home a few years ago, it was still the most bustling street in the entire city. Shopkeepers were busy with their business all day long. People going to and from the countryside carried loads of goods, and pedestrians filled the narrow road like ants. From dawn to dusk, there was hardly a moment of quiet. But now, everything had changed. Even the mornings, which used to be the busiest, saw only a few people walking around. By afternoon, it was so quiet that even the sound of a hungry dog passing by seemed unusually loud. The doors of the shops were covered with a thick layer of dust, as if they hadn't been opened in years. The goods on the shelves looked like unsold old stock, covered in dust. The shopkeepers were listlessly dozing off. All of this showed that Main Street was completely different. Perhaps the people of the hometown had seen this for so long that they found it normal. But for someone like me, who hadn't returned home in years, it was shocking. Even though Wen Di had already told me on the way back to my hometown: "The hometown is no longer the hometown it used to be."</p>
<p>In Front of the Guan Yu Temple</p>
<p>Going straight to the end of Main Street was the temple of Lord Guan Yu, considered the most efficacious in the entire city. It left a deep impression on me as a child because it was the liveliest and most fun place in the city. There were people gambling on "fish, shrimp, and crab," "twelve characters," and "four colors." There were also opera performances, storytelling, street performers doing magic tricks, and martial arts demonstrations. All sorts of entertainment gathered there, and because there were so many things to do, the place was always lively. Businesswomen would also stroll around there at night. So, anyone who had been to my hometown had almost certainly visited the Guan Yu Temple. As a child, I played there every day. Therefore, even though many years have passed, I still remember it clearly. Especially during the New Year and festivals, it was even more crowded. Merchants set up stalls, and groups of men and women from the city and the countryside came to offer incense. The temple keeper's income during these times of the year was considerable. So, every time I met the old temple keeper, he was always smiling. But now, the Guan Yu Temple in front of me had changed. The roof and the two fire doors in front of the temple used to be painted in dazzling red and gold, the walls were bright white, the red-faced Lord Guan was adorned with gold powder and wore a bright red robe every year, and the stone incense burner in front of the seat was always filled with thick smoke. All of that was gone. There were small bullet holes on the corners of the temple roof, the two main doors were missing, the walls were stained with large patches of black from rainwater leaks, the three stone incense burners were chipped and covered in spiderwebs, and Lord Guan in the seat looked older, his face covered in a layer of gray-black dust. Everything was different from the past. Under the screen wall, where gambling stalls used to be covered with white cloths, there were now only a few stalls laid out sparsely on the ground. The gamblers were just a few people wearing shorts or worn-out long gowns, and "twelve characters" had become "fan-tan." Moreover, I discovered that Old Wu from Wu Cuo Cheng, who used to be very honest and law-abiding, was in the crowd, pointing and gesticulating while discussing gambling strategies. His wrinkled face suddenly flushed red. He approached me and asked when I had returned, then lowered his head embarrassedly and said, "I'll come see you tonight," before quickly walking away.</p>
<p>Hometown, the hometown of my childhood, the hometown of the golden age, everything has passed. What stands before me is this desolate ancient city!</p>
<h3 id="e235">Mosquitoes <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Er He</p>
<p>In recent years, since I embraced the city life, I only suffered from the misery of bedbugs and forgot the ferocity of mosquitoes. This time, after returning to the fiery old home in June and staying there until after the bleak Mid-Autumn Festival before returning to Shanghai, I have deeply felt the hatred of mosquitoes. Zhuangzi's "Heavenly Movement" says, "Mosquitoes are fond of fine dust, causing sleepless nights." I have experienced this pain firsthand.</p>
<p>I never imagined that these gray, long-legged little things could be so ferocious. Although mosquitoes have always existed, I feel somewhat like Mrs. Jiu Jin, feeling that the mosquitoes of today are indeed different from the mosquitoes of the past. I clearly remember that the mosquitoes of the past were dull-witted, and it was very easy to kill ten or twenty of them. But the mosquitoes of today seem to have particularly keen senses. By the time I feel the sting and want to kill them, they have already flown away. Perhaps this is due to my old age.</p>
<p>This year, the harvest in the countryside is not bad, but there are especially many mosquitoes, which coincides with a well-known saying among the old and young in the countryside: "Many flies in a famine year, many mosquitoes in a harvest year." This means that many flies indicate a famine year, and many mosquitoes indicate a harvest year. This year, there are very few flies in the countryside, almost none. Although this is unfounded, the saying "Many flies in a famine year, many mosquitoes in a harvest year" does indeed apply to this year. However, I am the one who suffers from this. In fact, I have suffered enough because of mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Ancient books say: "Flies form a market in the morning, mosquitoes form a market in the evening." Indeed, there are particularly many mosquitoes in the evening, their momentum is vast, worthy of being called a "market." I live alone in a room that is not very big and not very small. I spend the whole day sweating in a wicker chair. Of course, I can't read, but the mosquitoes keep bothering me, preventing me from even having a moment of quiet fantasy. This makes me very sad. I have no choice but to hide inside the mosquito net. Because I got a moment of peace, I recalled a fantasy from four years ago. At that time, I imagined that I was a mosquito, and I could break into embroidered boudoirs and steal into silk curtains to suck the blood of beautiful young ladies. Even if I were killed, it could be said that I was "dying for love." But now, my mood is old after all, and these wild fantasies can no longer capture me! I feel the pain of a prisoner. Sweating, I lift the mosquito net and lie back on the wicker chair. But the mosquitoes still don't let me go. If it were in the past, I would have thought of various methods of revenge. I once painstakingly killed more than three hundred mosquitoes at once. It was a summer night, and because I was too tired, I fell asleep early. But I accidentally pushed the mosquito net open, and four or five mosquitoes came to visit me. Because I was tired, I ignored them. But they kept coming in larger and larger numbers, making it impossible to fall asleep. I woke up and decided to kill the mosquitoes to my heart's content. So, I simply pushed the mosquito net open, kept slapping everywhere, and waited quietly for the mosquitoes to come in. Finally, I tightened the mosquito net again, lit the lamp, and patiently scalded them. In this battle, I killed more than three hundred mosquitoes, none escaped. I felt victorious, turned off the light, and fell asleep soundly. But now, I have no intention of arguing with the mosquitoes. Sometimes, I stare blankly like a bookworm at the mosquitoes feasting on my blood, some flying clumsily like they are dragging "red lanterns," unable to fly, and some flying lightly like swallows, up and down. Then I hum: "When full, cherries are heavy; when hungry, willow catkins are light." I even forget the pain.</p>
<p>The reason I don't kill mosquitoes is not because I want to learn from the filial son Wu Meng of the Jin Dynasty, who did not drive away mosquitoes in the summer, fearing that they would leave him and bite his parents. I am simply too lazy to move. But after all, there is the pain of being bitten, and sometimes I unexpectedly kill two or three of them. Thinking of Meng Dongye's line, "Just seeking blood to fill, feeling life is cheap," I feel deeply saddened by the mosquitoes.</p>
<p>Around the Mid-Autumn Festival, the mosquitoes were probably more relentless because their death was approaching, making me suffer particularly severely. Now I have drifted back to the city. Based on past experience, I may not return to my hometown in three or four years. This rough article carries a bit of sadness.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Miscellaneous Notes from a Mountain Residence <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Hua</p>
<p>(1) Autumn Rain</p>
<p>Autumn, in the northern country, is the season of rain.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>I live alone in this remote mountain village, and the days are already difficult to pass. If I also encounter rainy days, the boredom is even more unimaginable.</p>
<p>At night, before going to bed, I always push open the window and look to see if there are any glittering stars in the sky. I am so afraid of rainy days. When I see the sky and earth merging into a boundless darkness, my heart sinks, and I fear that tomorrow will be a rainy day. Several times, I even dreamed of being caught in a heavy rain in the mountains.</p>
<p>Waking up early in the morning, seeing the sky outside the window a vast expanse of blue, as clear as jade in the imperial palace, and the sun like a soft tentacle, gently stroking the high wall across from me, I happily jumped out of bed, took my cane, and walked up the hillside to see the autumn forest and fields shrouded in a light veil. But autumn is the rainy season in the northern country, and it doesn't give me, this sick person, many sunny days. It's either heavy shade or drizzle.</p>
<p>Once, it rained for nearly ten days straight. The only pastime in the mountain residence was originally walking, but the mountain roads were full of yellow mud, and even after the rain, it was difficult to walk without slipping. So, I had to stay in the house all day, silently watching the rain leaking through the small thatched roof, watching the small splashes of water falling on the ground. Otherwise, I would lean against the damp windowsill, watching the reeds by the water's edge weeping and whispering in the wind and rain, or the small streams pouring down the hillside, and the blurred mountains and fields shrouded in thick smoke. At this time, my mood is depressed. I also often think about how much this humid air is ruining the health of this sick person. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Homesickness Song</p>
<p>Vast earth, where is my hometown? Before my eyes are wine-green lights and red lanterns, and melodious music rings in my ears! Hearts are intoxicated, people are frivolous, young ladies smile and feign anger, and gentlemen sip and sing lightly. They can't see the nation's vicissitudes, they can't hear the public's sighs. Light songs and graceful dances never end, never end, what a scene of peace! Vast earth, where is my hometown? Regret that distant North, the embroidered mountains and rivers have fallen! Mourning cries everywhere, wounds filling the horizon, the enemy's cannons shake the sky, and the blood of compatriots stains the desolate field, destroying cities and villages, separating children from parents and grandparents! Wandering all over the world, wandering, where is our hometown?</p>

<p>A small boat turns and returns to the home mountain. Fully loaded and returning with great wealth. I only worry, Tang Shi is still without news. If Zhao Rong comes again, how will I arrange it? I might as well go to the Tang family first. After thinking it over, I come out of the door. Leading the servant boy all the way around the long street. Walking to the side of Botong Bridge. I meet a boatman and bump into him. I ask him why he's so busy. Mi Tian Gong smiles and starts talking. He says that on the day before the Mid-Autumn Festival last year. He met Tang Sheng at the corner of the water. He calls a small boat and follows the big boat closely. He was kindly allowed to paint a hundred pieces of frost white silk. So, I've been coming to Tao Wu every day to look for news. The speaker is unintentional, but the listener is mindful. Zhishan's team is exceptionally happy. I give the boatman a gift of money first. The main planner is in my heart. I hate Zhao Rong for believing the family servant's words. She shouldn't have, she used force in my hall. Today's repayment is not difficult. I happened to meet Hengshan and his companions. They say that Tang Yin has already gone to the springs. The eight concubines all cried bitterly. Yunming hurriedly put on a smiling face. Fang will tell the whole story. The crowd of beautiful women are surprised, happy and suspicious. Although the information is conveyed, the person is not seen. I don't know when the flowers will be brought back. I beg them to go to Liting together. I persuade the good man to return to Su Tai early. Husband and wife can avoid separating.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>Under Mr. Zhao Banglu's strategy, Diantong has issued back pay. The news of the issuance of back pay naturally caused a thunderous cheer among the small clerks who had been hoping for rain after a long drought, but when the back pay was actually issued, it was a post-dated check for the next month, so the small clerks seemed to have to tighten their belts and wait for the date on the check to arrive.</p>
<p>I hope this is not a bounced check!</p>
<p>It is expected that after a month, Bao Ke "generation" will definitely borrow the power of Yuan (Muzhi) and Zhao (Bang...?) to promote Diantong's propaganda department.</p>
<p>Shang Boxun will go to Xi'an to become a movie theater owner.</p>
<p>After the rehearsal of "Xi Shi," someone said: China has such a beautiful woman, that's good one; a beauty who can save the country, that's good two; and now we can actually see such a play, that's good three.</p>
<p>In addition to these three goods, perhaps it should be added another good; such a good play is directed by Chen Dabei Guangsheng, that is good four. (Even with Mr. Chen Gexin's music direction, that is good five.)</p>

<h3 id="e243">Introduction to "Night Fragrance" <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>Script</p>
<p>"Night Fragrance" is directed by Cheng Bugao and has been in production for over a year. It was temporarily suspended for several months due to Ms. Hu Die's departure from the country. Now that Hu Die has returned, the entire project has been completed through day and night efforts and is presented to the public. The film is a love tragedy, with the main characters being a flower girl played by Hu Die, a young worker played by Zhao Dan, and a village girl played by Shu Xiuwen, forming a love triangle—Zhao Dan is deeply in love with Hu Die, while Shu Xiuwen is infatuated with Zhao Dan. Later, Hu Die is seduced by the young master Sun Min. Zhao Dan, heartbroken, angrily and resolutely marries Shu Xiuwen. In the end, Hu Die is abandoned by the young master Sun Min, Shu Xiuwen tragically dies in the chaos of war, and Zhao Dan sacrifices his own life for Hu Die. Here is an excerpt of what the director, Bugao, said about the script: "The script for 'Night Fragrance' was planned with Chen Jun Shouyin six or seven years ago. I also discussed it with Huang Jun Zibu the year before last, and finally last year, the old idea was revisited, new materials were sought, and with the enthusiastic help of friends, the play was completed."</p>
<p>Director</p>
<p>Director Cheng Bugao has a long history and significant contributions in China. The release of "Spring Silkworms" and "Raging Tides" marked a new era for Chinese cinema, rescuing it from the sentimentality of the Mandarin Ducks and Butterfly School and setting it on a new path. "Night Fragrance" is the culmination of his efforts over the past six or seven years. He had already planned to make this film when "Raging Tides" and "Spring Silkworms" were released. It can be said that "Night Fragrance" is his masterpiece following "Raging Tides" and "Spring Silkworms."</p>
<p>Actors</p>
<p>Hu Die: Needless to say, her acting skills have reached a state of perfection. She can play any type of character perfectly. The release of "Twin Sisters" demonstrated her acting ability and talent. In the same scene, she portrayed the archetypes of two different classes, rich and poor. The poor and humble expression of "Da Bao" and the luxurious demeanor of "Bao" are probably deeply imprinted in the minds of the audience, right? "Night Fragrance" is her commemorative work from her European tour, and of course, it is also a work in which she put extra effort into her acting.</p>
<p>Zhao Dan: Is a talented actor. Although his history of transitioning from stage to screen is not long, and he has not starred in many films, his name has already spread throughout the Chinese film industry. The characters he plays on screen are often very sentimental. In "Night Fragrance," he still plays a very neurotic person, but this time it is not the intellectual he is used to playing, but a passionate peasant youth. Undoubtedly, he will present a new image to us.</p>
<p>Sun Min: Is known for playing frivolous young masters. We know that playing a "villain" is more difficult than playing a "hero." The reason is that the "villain's" actions and attitudes are almost always repulsive. Actors often confuse "frivolity" with cunning and "superficiality" with "insidiousness," and cannot distinguish between them clearly. On the other hand, the scriptwriters often arrange many sympathetic plots for the "hero," making it easier to win the audience's favor. Sun Min still plays a frivolous young man in "Night Fragrance." His "cunning" actions on screen are almost unrecognizable from his usual self. Friends who know him do not believe that the superficial villain in "Night Fragrance" is the docile Sun Min. According to people who have seen the preview of "Night Fragrance," Sun Min is much more successful in this role than in his previous films.</p>
<p>Shu Xiuwen: Is also an actress who transitioned from stage to screen like Zhao Dan. She has not acted in many plays, but we can fully see her talent. In "Hot-Blooded Loyal Souls," she played the role of Qiu Jin. The expression and attitude of a pre-Qing revolutionary youth dissatisfied with the Manchus, as well as Qiu Jin's personality, were clearly expressed by her, giving people a full sense of realism. In "Night Fragrance," she plays a mean older sister who is infatuated with Zhao Dan and jealous of Hu Die, trying every means to destroy her rival in love. When she discovers that Hu Die is having an affair with Sun Min, she immediately tells Hu Die's father and Zhao Dan, making them both angry. She cunningly provokes Hu Die's father on the one hand, and comforts Meisheng on the other. With her cleverness, playing such a clever character is sure to be a success.</p>
