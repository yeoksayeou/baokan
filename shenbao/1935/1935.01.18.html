<p>技術問題法德尚待恊商</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　法國要求薩爾應包括於凡爾賽和約下萊因河不設軍備區域中、德國巳在原則上接受之、此項接受、載見於德國今日答覆國聯所草定交還薩爾辦法之牒文中、惟德國之最近行動、並未銷除法國要求所引起之僵局、因德國對於拆毁薩爾境内之鐵路軍營及其他隱含軍事價值之其他工程、曾提出對抗之建議也、尚有一點須需續加談判者、爲德國反對如德法兩國至三月一日不能於技術問題成立妥恊、應由國聯行政院爲仲裁人之議、按三月一日爲現議交還薩爾之日期也、日内瓦德總領事克魯爾今日與三人委員會討論德國之對案、繼乃以新建議電達柏林、法國在最後一分鐘所作薩爾解除軍備之解釋、德當局現視爲德國接受日内瓦建議最大之障碍、據柏林政界消息、德國無論如何、不接受足以引起薩爾與其他不設軍備區域待遇不同之任何辦法、（十七日路透電）</p>
<p>（日内瓦）　德國今巳於原則上贊成將薩爾劃爲非武裝區、今日並悉、德法巳同意於三月一日爲德國恢復薩爾主權之期、德國覆文巳於今晨提交法政府、内稱、凡爾賽和約旣巳决定薩爾之解除武裝問題、則此事無再談之必要云、是則薩爾之成爲非戰區域一事、德國巳默認矣、故如法政府接受德國此種解釋、則國聯行政院將於今日午後之會議、通過薩爾歸還德國之决議、（十七日國民電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3>薩爾投票給予我人之感想　　恒</h3>
<p>薩爾之歸屬問題。已因十三日之投票結果。而告解决。今後之政權移交。非戰區之設立。要爲枝節問題。無關大體。可不置論。今所欲一言者。卽爲吾人之感想是也。</p>
<p>薩爾者。歐洲重要煤區之一也。其所藴藏。以每年出貨一千萬噸計。可取六百年而不竭。且此處之煤。於大戰以前。德人向以鎔煉勞萊之鐵。故經濟上與技術上。與勞萊幾有不可分離之勢。戰後勞萊旣歸法國。則其欲佔薩爾。自爲情理之常。然今次投票結果。法國當局對之。殊爲坦然。不欲有所異議。此種重視諾言正義。愛好和平之精神。殊值得吾人之讚美。吾人以爲國際間之仇怨。原因雖多。然强佔他人之土地。奴隸非我之民族。要爲最大之原因。苟世界各國咸能痛餘土地之野心。尊重他人之人格。則國際間之酌隉不安。必可十去其九。不談和平而和平自至矣。此吾人甚望眞正愛好和平者。注意及之也。</p>
<p>薩爾未投票前。熟悉國際情勢者。雖多預料其歸德者居多數。唯歸德票數。竟在百分之九○以上。則殊出意料。良以薩爾自德國國社黨革命而後。現狀派因種種亡命者之鼓煽慫恿一時頗見活動。以是局外人對之。遂亦不敢遽下斷語。今觀此次投票結果。可知薩爾人民所欲者乃復國耳。苟能復國。卽切個人利害。皆可不顧。此種以民族利益爲前提之日耳曼精神。殊足爲吾國民之楷模。彼見狀派徒爭黨派個人之利益。偷安一時。宜其爲薩爾人民所唾棄也。</p>
<p>國聯統治薩爾。十有五年。對於居民。尚多覊席之處。然其結果。仍歸德國。於此可知凡以武力侵略他人之土地者。終必失敗。此一事實。古今中外。實例甚多。不必薩爾爲然。如我國晋時之五胡。宋後之遼金元。明後之清。方其侵入我國也。無不聲勢甚壯。然及其終也。每爲我所同化。曾不能損我之毫末。此一例也。再證以近代歐洲之史實。亦無不然。卽侵略他人者無不失敗。而被侵略者或竟被奴隸者。無論時間之久暫。無不有復國之可能。如巴爾幹半島上之各國。受土耳其之統治。歷數百年。然至十九世紀而後。卽紛紛獨立自主矣。又如波蘭小恊約各國。亦莫不然。於此可知民族精神。一日存在。則終有復興之一日。彼好以武力侵略人士。奴隸他人者。徒增民族間之惡感仇恨。而使世界戰爭循環不息而巳。</p>
<p>九一八來。我國人士。意氣銷沈。達於極點。人人心中。皆視失地之收復。爲不可能之事實。然觀於今次薩爾投票之結果。可知民族精神。苟其不死。則失土終能復歸祖國也。故我國今日所需者。非落拓潦倒之悲觀。乃自强不息之振奮。必先竭其智能。盡其在己。使一國之内。團結無間。以民族之利益爲前提。毋斤斤於個人一己之私。則萬事可爲。何况區區失地之收回哉。所要者在我國人有無澈底之覺悟耳。</p>

<h3>羅斯福咨文參院力促參加世界法庭</h3>

<p>（華盛頓）　昨日羅斯福總統以咨文送達參議院、建議美國加入海牙國際常設法院、官廳人士相信參議院必可通過、緣事前外間傳聞、羅斯福對於此事不致親自出馬、兹總統竟以咨文送達參議院、可見其成竹在胸、美國若干人士對於國際法院曁國聯會一切事物、雖仍熱烈反抗、但薩爾問題得以迅速順利解决、未始非國聯會之功、美國懷疑人士與反對國聯會者因亦爲之折服、頃參議院討論總統咨文、加利福尼亞州共和黨參議員强森、素來贊助總統、但反對加入國際法院、起而發言謂、「國際法院與吾美漠不相關、吾美若果加入、必致牽入歐洲漩渦而無以自拔、」此殆反對派所認爲最大理由、所幸羅斯福總統業巳預料及之、其咨文含有先發制人之語、其言曰、美國歷屆共和民主兩黨政府對於國際法院、均在原則上表示贊成、「此種政策至爲健全、與美國人民見解相符合、美國主權無論如何、絕不致因此而削弱云云（十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）　參院膨脹派領袖湯邁斯所召集之全國幣制會議今日已經開幕、首由若干全國團體之代表發言、力促卽刻减低美國幣價、經過簡短之辯論、卽行通過議案、要求早日將美元恢復一九二六年之購買力、並設立「美國中央銀行、」以代聯邦儲備制度、並擴充其統制全國放欵之權力、尚有其他計劃如下、（一）卽刻以現金支付退伍軍人之恩俸、（二）再以白銀爲幣制本位、以金銀十六對一之比價自由鼓鑄、（三）再行减低美元中之黄金成份、湯邁斯致開會詞、表示希望、謂到會人士、旣代表美國人民之半數、當能合力議成具體方案、向國會提出云、考格林神父則稱、如國會不欲引起革命、則須恢復其憲法所賦之救力、以統制國内幣價、並謂「現在我人所有者、不過簿記上之錢幣而已、」彼亦主張將聯邦儲備銀行一律收歸國營、此外尚有前任參議員奥文代表硬幣派主張國會有自私人收回調整幣價之權、耶禮大學敎授費許主張聯邦政府以現欵收回現爲銀行所執之公債、國會銀派議員如韋勒、波拉馬丁等等亦皆到會、惟無表示、銀派人士謂湯氏最注意者、爲减低黄金及美元之價值、而以白銀爭爲本位、際此以外、爲紙幣膨脹等等皆非所願聞云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　全國通貨膨脹會之提案委員會今日向該會提議發行新幣、俾退伍兵恩俸得全數付現、並提議設立中央銀行、以統制國家貨幣、依其提議、國會將接收鑄幣權、而調節通貨、並有設法應付緊急事變之權、提案委員會不主張、（一）創立與黄金脱離之穩健而充分的貨幣、庶國家可應付外幣之操縱、（二）使美國幣值處于不少可恢復一九二六年物價之地位、今日財政部長摩甘索與司法部長克明士之臨時集議、已引起當局、或將有財政上新措施之推測、（十六日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）　此間官塲深信最高法院必擁護金條文之廢止、但若法院判决不利於發問、則當局必提出立法案、而使羅總統廢止金條文之舉動爲合法、美總統减輕美元金成分、藉以提高物價之嘗試、乃總統程序中之極重要部份、而此舉之成功與否、繫於一九三三年六月間金條文之失效、是以法院如有不利於政府之判决、則美總統勢必設法以避免因此而起之後果、蓋决不願使其新措施有顚覆之危險也、際此國民亟盼法院裁判之時、通貨膨脹派已集於此、擬恊定一種計畫、使美元更爲低廉、參議員湯姆士已召集贊成通貨膨脹之各機關代表、與國會議員集議、此項集會、人稱爲全國通貨膨脹會議、湯氏宣佈此會之目的在多得更低廉之美元、以期恢復一九二六年價格云、參議員韋勒聲稱、關於貨幣之各種計畫、將視最高法院判决、載有金條文之證券是否必須用舊有美元或可用現有美元償付之、一俟判詞宣佈後、當局將採行切實程序以應付之、無論法院有何舉動、要皆無足爲患、因國會可立卽立法、以應付因此而起之局勢也、金融界一般意見以爲通貨膨脹派之活動、足以徵實羅總統寗願不服從最高法院、而不願重行提高美元價格之猜測、同時紐約證劵市塲之交易、現頗沉寂、蓋欲待金條文案之結果也、（十七日路透電）</p>

<p>孟買棉花　今日棉市、缺方之補進、吸收多頭之了結、四五月期白洛志棉、收盤價格爲二百四十一羅比七安那、漲起一安那、</p>
<p>利物浦麥　今晨麥市、有較穩趨勢、午後一時、五月期價漲半便士、而爲五先令零二五、</p>
<p>利物浦棉　今日棉市、較爲堅定、午後一時、五月期價爲六·八二、漲起三磅音、</p>
<h3>橡皮</h3>
<p>倫敦　今晨市况平靜、午時四月六月期成交價格、爲六便士五六二五、與昨日收盤價同、</p>
<p>紐約　今日開盤漲六磅音、後因散户賣出、價稍低落、</p>
<h3>證券</h3>
<p>紐約　證劵開盤前、有利於市况之因素、爲昨日證劵市塲之動作、可視爲金條文案判决前市塲中人態度較爲寗靜之表示、缺方地位近巳大增、故衆信脚地因以起色、市况當可轉佳、加以商業消息良好、故市况現漸看好、而不利於市况之因素、則爲金條文問題之無把握、仍有限制交易之影響、今晨證劵開盤清淡而穩、大都微漲、金條文案仍使人心不定、故今日市塲似仍有清淡狹小之趨勢、</p>
<p>又據路透社報告、金條文之爭議、雖仍爲今晨垣街之重要因素、然昨日市况尚能鎭定、人氣因以轉佳、證劵交易所脚地堅强、與其他市塲相同、說者乃預料今晨證市之價格、可望逐漸起色、迨今晨開盤後、交易依然不旺、惟一般證劵大都微漲、市塲中仍有若干恐慌氣象、故市况未必遽有大變動也、兹將紐約證劵市價列左、</p>

<h3>日工商視察團參觀連雲港</h3>
<p>回程經徐州西上</p>
<p>至西安後始東返</p>
<h3>抵新浦情形</h3>
<p>新浦通訊、青島日本工商會議所視察團平岡小太郎等一行十八人、於十二日抵新浦、十三日參觀連雲港、十四日往徐州、定十五日再西行赴西安、兹將該視察團一行出發及參觀情形誌下、</p>
<p>視察團團員十八人、以在華日本紡績同業會理事平岡小太郎爲領袖、其餘十七人、爲福昌公司神谷東一·大同洋紙行萬井正盛·岩城商會田邊郁太郎·正金銀行今澤節三·大裕膠皮工廠高橋哲·肥後市次·等六人爲甲組、其中除肥後市次至徐州時南下赴京訪問岡野外、餘皆北上回青島、瑞豐棉行山室欽一·大倉洋行前田孝之助·淺井商店淺井治人·隆興沙廠内田節二·末竹商店末竹庸朔·日華蠶禾會社川井正久·白石洋行白石保喜·昌和洋行小川岩男·青島工商會議所島津忠男·及伊澤公幸·三井洋行水野武男·連同團長平岡小太郎共十二人爲乙組、擬再往西安鄭州及平津一帶參觀、期以月内回程、除水野武男自清南起身外、其餘十七人皆云來自青島、視察團十八人、均持有青島或濟南日本領事頒發之護照、註明二月期限、視察起身前、青島市長沈鴻烈、分别電知灌雲縣政府及其他沿途之地方政府、派員迎接護行、一行於十日自青島乘膠濟路車出發、在濟南住一夜、十一日、乘津浦路車南下、十二日晨抵徐州、當有徐屬地方政府人員迎接、立轉乘隴海路車東行、在新安鎭、有海屬地方政府人員接替護行、下午四時半、車抵新浦、因天色巳暗、不便前往、遂留新浦、住於大東旅社、</p>
<p>十三日上午六時半、一行十八人、山海屬地方政府人員護行、乘隴海路車十時至老窰、老窰面前、即爲正在建築之連雲港一二兩號碼頭、比由隴海鐵路管理局港務處主任張傑超·及西段總段長董耀堂、領導參觀碼頭、第二號碼頭、即將竣工、且在西岸已泊有輪船二隻、第一號碼頭、正在運石鋪底、包工之河南公司、以小火車運石、甚形忙碌、視察團諸人、對於水深出高地形出入口貨物、以及當地商業、均甚注意、棉花更引日人興趣、以手撕棉、試其纖維長度、平岡小太郎、擬見治港大班哈姆氏、因適值星期、未能尋到、因時間短促、未及上山入鎭、十一時、即乘車東行、下午二時抵新浦、</p>
<p>由新浦車站至街内大東旅社、由地方政府備有汽車四輛、供視察團乘用、車至大東旅社門前、山室欽一等三人下車、要求地方政府人員允全團乘原車往大浦一行、其意初甚堅决、經地方政府人員再三告以道路因雨泥濘、車行不便、且四鄉多匪、恐出意外、乃止、視察團即進旅社休息、稍息、平岡小太郎·及肥後市次、要求參觀飛機塲、當即前往、復有白石保喜等十一人、至河上參觀、另有二人上街參觀、</p>
<p>因日間忙於參觀、未得暇進食、下午四時始就餐、餐後、在旅社休息、</p>
<p>十四日上午十一時四十分、視察團一行十八人、乘車西往徐州、甲組六人、當日即乘津浦路車分往南北各處、乙組定十五日再西行赴西安、</p>
<p>據平岡小太郎及山室欽一等談話、覺連雲港似嫌略小、至兩個碼頭完全作成時、只能停泊三千噸以下之輪船六隻、不能與可停泊萬噸以上二十五隻輪船之青島碼頭相比、但仍不失爲一吐納貨物之良港、連雲港距青島　近、正應提携、互通商輪、以求中日貿易之發展云云、</p>
<h3>過徐州情形</h3>
<p>徐州通訊、日本旅青島僑民、鑒於隴海鐵路貫通中原、東闢連雲海港、西達長安、在地理形勢上、有取青島而代之的趨向、且該路在國防商業上、亦佔重要地位、故特組織隴海路連雲港工商考察團、一行十八人、團長爲在華日本紡績同業會理事平岡小太郎、並由青島日本工商會議所主事伊澤公幸、恊同照料、一行於十二日由青過濟祗徐、轉車東去、地方行政當局、先期接得省府電令、妥加保護、計行政專員公署派虞克裕·縣府派陳捷三·公安局派趙益謙·陪行、隴海路局亦派總段長董耀堂隨行招待、該團於十二日晚到達新浦、十三日晨、由隴海路爲備包車將該團運至墟溝孫家山老窰各處、分别遊覽、尤其對於老窰港口之海深、船隻吃水量、及山勢高度、垂詢土人至詳、並按地圖分别觀察、當時並擬拍攝照片、爲隨護之行政人員婉言勸阻、渠等以有阻興、表示不滿、當晚、仍乘車返回新浦、以天雨地濘、行程不便、於十四日晨、仍乘隴海快車西返、當夜八點半抵徐、</p>
<p>該團抵徐下車後、由地方政府派員引導至花園飯店住宿、該團除大部西上考察外、另有團員肥後、於當晚乘津浦車南下、因事晉京、另有團員高橋·村井·岡巴·今澤·神谷·五人、於十五日晨六時半、乘車北返濟南、該團大部、由平岡統率、於十五日上午遊覽徐埠各處名勝、並考察商業市况、赴各洋貨商號考察日貨之銷量、同時接洽準備供給、</p>
<p>當該團抵徐後、及十五日離徐前、記者兩度往訪、承該團公推平岡小太郎·及伊澤公幸接見、記者當詢其此次考察目的、及徐海兩地參觀後之感想、答稱、吾等向住青島經營工商業、十數年不等、中國内地、向少遊歷、此次乘年終歳首、商業清淡之際、特組織隴海路考察團沿東段之海港、向西參觀、蓋連雲港距離青島甚近、且關係東方著名商港、兹銀視察、對該港之工程偉大、頗堪贊許、惟覺老窰碼頭、地居山脚、未能發展、將來於建造房屋、頗受限制、似未能充分發展、即裝卸貨之老窰碼頭、亦覺狹窄、如與滬青兩處較、固覺稍遜、但位在兩埠之間、聯絡港埠、頗有關係也、吾等前來、在可能範圍、或擬前往經營商業、此行西上、擬過鄭州·洛陽·各處下車遊覽、即直趨西安、安旬日轉鄭經北平返青云云、</p>
<p>該團在徐州遊覽半日、當於十五日午十二時四十分離徐、乘隴海西去特别快車赴鄭、其原定計劃、擬過開封下車、嗣又决定直趨洛陽、過鄭時、如有日僑在該處匝候、即擬下車、否則到洛停車、並擬到華隂時、遊覽華山、在西安擬有三日躭擱、即行東返、再轉北平、據隨同保護行政人員談、該團所到各地、對地理形勢、頗爲注意、並輒詢何處爲飛機塲、何處爲兵營、何處係要塞地帶、其行動不似單純之遊歷視察云、（中央社）</p>

<h3>保健學界之大發明營養療治赫飛靈之醫治的功效</h3>
<p>回復胃腸天賦之機能</p>
<p>制止體内毒素之發生最新發明却病助老法</p>
<p>綜合多種天然的大補品</p>
<p>具有補肺補腎補腦之功</p>
<p>（一）囘復胃腸天賦之機能，制止體内毒素之發生。</p>
<p>現在醫學進步，一日千里，昨日之是，今日之非，實可使人驚駭。醫聖梅智尼高夫博士，突然發表一嶄新學說曰：吾人於平常時，有無數細菌與食物混入腸管，逐次達到於大腸内，此乃多量糞便，長時積蓄之處，亦卽細菌之合理繁殖地。菌種一到大腸，卽以可驚之超等速度，繁殖成長不斷，使糞便起醱酵腐爛作用，造成許多毒素。此毒素從腸壁吸收，侵入於血液中，損害全身之細胞組織，此所謂自家中毒，亦卽老衰疾病之大原因，以致減少應享邁齡之生命。若使大腸内之蓄積物常打掃清潔，制止腸内腐爛菌之繁殖，則人生可得無病長夀，此梅博士之長夀論是也。吾人一旦發生胃腸病，則惡心，嘔吐，吐酸，頭痛，腸鳴，下痢，便秘，腹痛飮食不振，身體衰弱，乃致作事疲倦，病勢愈趨愈重，遂至胃腸粘膜上發炎症，食物之消化，更加不良，無力吸收，且腸内發生毒素蔓延全身，因此人生天然的抵抗力非常減退，故無法而受害於外來病菌之侵略，易染紅白痢，霍亂，瘟痧，及肺病，腎臟病危難症之虞。考察今日胃腸病之療法，其藥品種類甚多，然皆係化學製劑，不過臨時制止其病狀，補助消化之効，要非助長胃腸原來之機能，故其胃腸非但越發衰弱，而且招來反面之害。例如服用蘇打劑雖能暫止過酸之症，未免轉使胃弱增加之虞。又如服用止瀉劑，瀉雖止，而腸内積滯有害物質，嘔吐膨脹等症，因之更加厲害。總而言之，則從來之胃腸藥，均無溯源治本之功，卽對於胃腸細胞之衰弱，無力使其回復，且無力增進消化機能及吸收作用也。最新發明赫飛靈，能使萎疲不振之胃腸，變成健全之胃腸，回復天賦源來之機能，使消化能力充足，吸收作用顯著，實爲普通市藥所未有之功能。且赫飛靈之功効，使腸管内常保清潔，每日得暢快之通便，制止腸内腐敗消滅體内一切之黴菌或有害物，一併剷除，各種症狀如雲消霧散，如此而數十年來之痼疾，亦能痊愈，使食慾急進，體量增多，誠令人驚訝而有餘。不止此也，赫飛靈因爲綜合所有食品或營養劑不可比擬之各種榮養素所成生物製劑，故其榮養素不須消化而能直接吸收於體内，能使全身之衰弱從速恢復昔日之健康，此乃全世界之醫家，應用赫飛靈於胃腸病，以謀囘復胃腸天賦之機能，絕非偶然也。</p>
<p>（二）綜合多種天然的大補品，具有補肺補腎補腦之功。</p>
<p>赫飛靈竟占得肺結核治療劑中之第一位，何故而將肺病最爲危險之食慾不振，予以神速恢復而非他藥所能及者，則因赫飛靈成分中所含古高那結及因素林，曾使法國胃腸病醫聖勃阿斯博士所驚嘆曰：此方足謂之食慾素者也。蓋此成分，能促進消化原動力之胃液，膵液，膽汁之分泌，旺盛胃腸之吸收力，同時與其他諸成分互相恊力，貢獻血液之造成，使白血球增加溶殺結核菌之作用，並增加抗毒素結果熱度下降，盜汗，咳嗽，咯血等症狀均能消退。由此之故，病者之食慾，得以急速恢復，大有三餮不能靜待之勢。一面因胃腸之活動著見活潑，所進食物無不消化而吸收無遺。素來結核，消耗體力，極爲激烈，故結核患者爲補所缺，易陷過食或偏食。結果最易傷胃損腸，但此時如服用赫飛靈，則因有各種營養素，以微粒狀態，含於此中，爲量極多，例如維他命各種，酵素，燐鐵，含水炭素，蛋白質，脂肪，及其他構成身體細胞不可缺少之主要成分等，均不勞胃腸而直接供給於全身。如此而使患者能恢復昔日之體力與轉弱爲强之功能。結果集多難治之結核痼疾，亦能根本痊愈，乃當然之結果。德國肺病自然療法研究大家芙列美爾博士提倡營養新療法亦卽此也。大凡吾人之精力減退，其原因决非一部器管組織之衰弱，多因全身之氣血衰弱，元氣不足所致，故欲謀精力之强壯，非先謀全身之健康不可。若用肉享賓或刺激神經等之春藥，待發虚陽，作事繁多，其毒害與煙癮相差不遠，而致破滅健康。惟赫飛靈爲補給珍貴之營養素，如維他命，酵素，燐，鐵，含水炭素，因素林等。滋補全身之功能，回復青春時代之强壯。且赫飛靈成分中之精力素古利高堅實佔全成分之一二。三二％更爲豐富。故服用赫飛靈，能補給其精力素，使一般疲倦蒸糜症狀豁然消散而興奮起來。然而此并非如打針藥一時興奮，乃精力及其他諸種有効成分之恊成作用，其効愈久愈大。赫飛靈含有腦及神經營養素列西津，此乃有機燐酸鹽，服用赫飛靈則腦及神經組織附與活動力，故學生，敎員，辦事員，銀行家，研究家，及其他精神疲勞之人，必須服用此藥，則神經之運動作用，比平常轉加靈敏。赫飛靈專治各種胃腸病，衰老，糖尿病，腎臟炎，便秘，鴉片嗎啡中毒諸症。精力減退，乳汁分泌不足，虚弱，乳幼兒皮膚病，均有不可思議之功効，尚有老衰，婦人科，衰弱等疾病，皆有顯著之神効，惠顧諸君，認明青天白日花旗商標，方保眞實聖品。</p>

<h3>彭祥瑛講演市民與防空關係（續）</h3>
<p>那末、我們旣然知道燃燒彈引起火災的可畏、和在空襲時消防的困難、則平時就應先組織消防自衛隊、或防火班、並熱心從事訓練、努力購置消防器材、以備戰時補助消防隊的不足、</p>
<p>現在我們把日本已有的防空設備和組織、對於平時、應付災害發生的時候所得到的利益、做一個證例、試可使我們知道防空設備、不僅在戰時可以防護我們的生命財産而同時也可防止我們平時的災害蔓延、日本因爲感覺各國空軍發達、航續半經的伸張、恐其扶桑三島、易遭空襲在她的國防及戰略的觀點上、積極從事防空設備、近年以來、於其全國各重要都市、不惜巨資、努力各種防空設施、大舉的實行防空演習、她自昭和三年、（即我民國十七年）在大阪作了初次的防空演習以後、昭和四年、接着又有名古屋的防空演習、昭和六年、有九州的防空演習、昭和八年、有東京的防空演習、去年八月、又在大阪作大規模的防空大演習、其間尚有各城市的小規模的防空演習、即其殖民地的朝鮮京城、及台灣等處、亦舉行防空演習、可見日本對於防空的努力、是不亞於世界上其他各國的在未曾受過敵機襲擊的日本、對於防空的設施、尚且如此、我們這創痛未痊的赤裸裸的都市、還不應該迅速的講求防護設施嗎、鄙人在去年七月、因爲想知道日本的防空情形、特地東渡去參觀大阪的防空演習、始知她們此次的演習、是籌備了一年、費欵數十萬、到演習的時候、參加的軍隊、有四師的動員、參加的民衆、亦有千餘萬、除了飛行第一第三聯隊、轟炸第七聯隊、及明野飛行學校與海軍飛機、新聞社飛機、運輸公司飛機等、約七十餘架飛機、參加演習外、並有高射砲第一聯隊及各野砲聯隊之高射砲四十八門、照空燈·聽音機·各二十八架、高射機關砲及高射機關槍二百餘挺、配置於京都大阪神户一帶、担任軍事的防空演習、並有千葉防空氣球隊之阻塞氣球六個、高揚空中、以阻止敵機、此外如參加演習之機關、則自大阪鐵路局、名古屋鐵路局、大阪通信局、名古屋通信局、大阪税關、神户税關、及各府縣市區鄉村之各機關、與中央政府、交通部、鐵道部、所轄之各機關學校等、凡在演習區域者、幾無不參加、而最值得我們注意者、厥爲負民間防空重任的防護團、防護團是市民防避空襲的唯一機關、即是敵機投下炸彈·燃燒彈·毒氣彈時·爲减輕或避免損害而服務的一種團體、該團是由在鄉軍人會會員、青年團團員、青年訓練所學生、（以上如我國之學生軍、童子軍等、）及消防員、街坊自治會會員、醫學衛生團體、婦女團體等、組織而成、團本部設在大阪市政府内、按市中十五區、各區組織區防護團、區之下、又按各防護地區、設防護分團、分團之下、設各班、以直接担任防護勤務、其防護團的編組情形如左、</p>
<p>大阪市防護團丨某區防護團丨某防護分團丨（（一）警備班（二）警報班）（三）防火班（四）交通整理班（五）避難所管理班（六）避雖者誘導班（七）工作班（八）防毒班（九）救護班（十）配給班（十一）宣傳班（十二）連絡班</p>
<p>這次演習時、大阪市防護團、共轄二百八十個分團、合計有團員十七萬一千五百人、此外尚有工廠防護團、九百零二個分團、合計十七萬四千七百二十五人、皆由大阪各工廠的男女工人和職員組織而成、以任空襲時工廠的防護、以上共計幾達三十五萬人、都在平時受過防空的訓練、均具有防空知識和技能、而且組織很嚴義、即使不是防空演習的時期、也可隨時召集、以應付各種災難、如去年九月、大阪遭颶風和洪水的大災時、大阪因爲防護團的努力救護、對於當時的救急、以及事後的復興、收效不少、對不可防止的天災、尚且如此、對人爲的空襲、必更可發揮其能力、以達消極防空的目的、是可想而知的、</p>
<p>總之、日本就大阪一市、就有市民組織成的三十歳萬個防護團員、其他各重路市鎭的防空組織、與設施的情形、當然也可推定了、這裏、我們不僅知道日本的國民對於防空的注意與熱心、不少遜於英法的國民、而同時我們更是知道防空的設備和組織、在平時防止災害、確有莫大效能、現在我們再拿日本關東大地震時、做一個比例、更是使我們知道没有防空的設備和組織、在平時災害發生的時候、是無法防止的、當關東大地震的時候、東京市同時起火的地方、有一百三十五處、火熖彌天、繁華都市、頓成地獄、惟其中的四十三處火災、是由市民在起火的當初撲滅了、這時東京市内房屋崩倒極多、街衢阻塞不通、假若這四十三處的火災、市民不自動的加以撲滅、專待消防隊到來、則全東京市必歸於燼、然考當時東京市民、尚無空襲觀念的消防組織、若在今日、則其受害當更减少、况空襲是有防空警報傳達、原可預知危險之將臨、市民能有充分的準備時間、被投下的燒夷彈、縱然猛烈、但不能悉數命中、臨時若能努力馳救、火災的被害、自可减輕、那末、我們在這個明證之下、也就應該迅速的從事防空設施、不要等到大難臨頭、臨渴掘井、那是來不及了、（未完）</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第七回　聞語掩啼痕賣身道苦留心窺請東投靠情殷</p>
<p>於是乎我們再進行第二步功夫，實行自己去求見。有着這樣的精神，按着步驟走去，我相信總可達到目的。老實告訴你，無論什麽大官，就是怕我們見不着他的面，假如見得着他的面，用包圍的法子去包圍，不怕他不給我差事，所難者，就是見面的這一關，不容易闖過去就是了。說着，他揚揚了兩手，連連的擺了幾下頭，彷彿是說，他有些懷才不遇的意味。李士廉心裏，可也想着，你越是這樣說得有道理，越不能讓你去和程志前認識，要不，我得來這樣一個好機會，算是相送給你了。便笑道：你說着怕不是對。不過程某這個人，也是精明之極，而且有點驕氣，大概不容易對付。我不願睬他。張介夫鼻子裏哼一聲，笑道：那要什麽緊，李士廉聽到他說自有辦法，心中加倍的感着不高興，便淡淡的道：那也再看機會罷。這樣身分小，脾氣大的人，我也懶和他作朋友。張介夫在社會上淘溶的程度，那是在李士廉以上。李士廉這樣不高興的態度，如何不知道，跟着笑了一笑，也就没有向下說了。他放李士廉出去了，自己也急急忙忙的走出旅館去，約莫有一小時，方始回來。他看見程志前尚在他屋子裏，並没有出去，連自己的屋子也不要進去，站在他房門口，就半彎了腰笑道：程先生没有出去嗎？志前道：請進來坐罷。張介夫那是巴不得一聲，立刻走了進來。可是這裏有一件事讓他首先所注意的，便是桌上放了一張八行，上寫：明日午刻十一時，敬請先生在大陸春便酌，勿却是幸。弟李士廉拜啟。這眞是莫道君行早，更有早行人了。不過在張介夫方面，作法可又另是一樣呢。（一一五）</p>
<h3>國畫談</h3>
<p>— 逸梅</p>
<p>翻檢中國的畫史，可以說是人才輩出，每一時代，必有若干代表作品，如吳道子的唐畫，馬遠的宋畫，倪雲林的元畫，沈唐文仇的明畫，四王吳惲的清畫，各有各的面目，各有各的精神，無怪可以名垂久遠，爲藝術的宗匠。傳至近今，雖受着西洋潮流的震蕩，一部分的人，已努力到油畫木炭畫水彩畫方面去，可是宗旨堅定，純粹爲中國畫的也不在少數。尤其在上海，一般國畫家時常開那國畫展覽會，有合作的，也有個人的，雖表面上是給人們對於國畫的認識和欣賞，但實際却大都因爲供過於求，作品没有主顧，所以祇得東開會，西展覽，賣畫送裱，大事宣傳。結果往往有所得無幾，反而折去開銷和廣告費的。以致國畫的前途，彷彿遮了一重灰色的幕，没有些兒光明可覩。有的說書畫一類，都是富貴頑意，市面旣不景氣，農村又這樣的破産，謀衣食之不遑，那裏再有閒錢來買書畫張掛。這話當然很合於事理，但是細想起來，也有其他的原因，因爲從前的人們，把畫來代表人格的。入其室，丹青四壁，盡爲名家超逸之筆，這個主人襟懷的雅淡，也就可想而知。還有摺扇在握，携帶出門，在揮暑的時候，人家瞧到了丹青名家的署欵，便知道你這人是很有來歷的，便不敢來欺侮你，折辱你，無形中省却了多少煩惱。到了現在世風大變，處處以金錢爲前提，談不到什麽人格，更没有什麽雅俗的分别，那麽自然用不着丹青畫幅來代表。還有一層，畫是作爲裝飾品的。現在房屋競趨歐化，歐化的房屋，掛了一幅國畫來裝飾，似乎不合眼光。尤其最近一切建築和佈置，崇尚立體派，以簡樸光潔爲美，一反從前的繁文縟飾，丹青畫幅，自然付諸淘汰之列了。所以照這趨勢看起來，國畫每况愈下，已到了末路，恐再也没有發揚光大的日子。鄙人認得一位很有名的老畫師，某次有個青年很嚮慕他的丹青妙技，托人介紹，願執贄他的門下，那位老畫師便問那介紹人道：這位青年家裏有無資産，將來學成了，作何期望。介紹人說：是家境清寒，預備學成了，恃丹青爲活的，那位老畫師就很爽脆的回覆他，旣然如此，還是勸那青年好好的學習他種較有希望的生意，從了我，將來難免要餓死的，莫躭誤人家的前途吧。老畫師的話，是多麽的沉痛啊，唉！</p>
<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （吳雄劍）</p>
<p>「一張嘴，兩爿皮，翻來覆去都是伊！」這句話眞是不錯。譬如，一個窮人去赴晏，如果狼吞虎嚥，旁邊就有人說：「好像幾世没吃過的，眞像搶藥飯。」如果拘守維謹，又有人說：「這種人没上過檯面，看看都　飽了！」</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>接着，我們又回到了正中的一間小小的便殿上來，太后已凖備歸座休息了：忽然又給伊瞧見了一頭形態很生動的木馬，在一個不很明亮的牆角裏，兀立着。它的大小高低，和眞正的活馬一般無二，四條腿像生着一根的深深地植在磚土之下，它的背上，也有一副完整的馬鞍，鞍上釘着無數的發光的金屬帽釘。丨或許從前也是釘的寳石，後來才掉换的。丨伊先是似乎很詫異，便急着走過去仔細察看了一回，慢慢地點着頭，表示伊巳經領悟了：可是我們却還理會不出它的作用來，光緒是始終懶洋洋地絕不注意。於是太后的話匣子又開了。</p>
<p>「一個行獵的人所最不可缺少的技能就是箭術和騎術，關於箭術的學習，方才我們已經見過了；現在，這一匹木馬便是專門供給練習騎術用的！因爲騎術中最主要又是最不容易學習的乃是上馬的迅速和敏捷，譬如我們遇見了一頭野獸，射中了它一箭或兩箭，它已經倒在地上了，似乎它巳經是死定了，我們便少不得要馳馬過去看一看，它却依舊躺着不動，這樣我們總以爲是可以下馬去剥取它的皮或把它綑起來帶走了：不料才下馬，它倒又跳起來了，這時候，我們就不能不用最純熟的身法，一躍上馬，否則，就會中它的狡計而喪命。所以，我們過去的許多領袖，時常要到這裏來利用這匹木馬練習上馬的身法：往往繼續不斷的練上好幾個時辰，累得混身大汗，才肯歇息。（二二五）</p>
<h3>來路夥計</h3>
<p>— 張凰</p>
<p>在婦女國貨年中，都市的一般摩登婦女，却莫不以足登來路貨皮料的高跟皮鞋爲時髦的起點，習慣不以爲怪，這眞可怪！就說我們的表姊罷，伊在女親戚中久被公認爲智識最高的一人，可也未能免俗，一雙高跟皮鞋常套在伊的足下。伊說：「我本是極願提倡國貨的，可惱的是這高跟皮鞋一陣咯吱咯吱的行路聲，好似有誘惑性的，使我覺得不穿了這個，連得人也没有神氣了。卽使我要勸人服用國貨；也說不響嘴了，只有自定主意，在我個人一切採用國貨的條件下，保留了這高跟皮鞋一事。</p>
<p>一天，伊邀我陪伊到一家西人開設的皮鞋舖去買鞋，因伊知道伊的一個朋友，新近在這家舖子裏買得滿意的貨品。伊想，這總是買外國貨一回事，落得便宜。我想，陪伊去見識一下西人商店的情形，未爲不可。於是四隻脚（我的意思是說兩個人）走進了這家富於異國情調的鞋舖。</p>
<p>鞋舖裏有五六個西人和一二個華人在着。我揣測必由華人來招待的，當我們華人來光顧時，丨所謂「物以類聚」。不道一個年青的西人却爭先奔近前來，開口用英語說請坐。接着，他似在我們躊躇未答之間，領悟了與我們作英語會話的不相宜，便掉舌作半生半熟的中國國語，進行他做生意的手續。他很敏捷地取到一雙新式皮鞋，在一眼看了我表姊的脚寸之後，坐着矮凳替伊試穿，殷勤動問舒服與否。據伊對我說，實在服脚。問到價錢，五塊大洋，這果然是最低廉了，像這樣一雙新式的皮鞋，在上海的市塲上。</p>
<p>表姊對這價目，當然不作苛求的異議；但是這異常的廉價，引了伊對於工作方面草率的懷疑，伊就向這來路夥計提出這個問題。</p>
<p>這個來路夥計的含笑而興奮的答辭，好像早巳料到有此一着的，他說：「請看，這樣堅固而又新式的工作，是極可信任的，因爲我們舖子裏的貨品，全由機器製造的。一個人管理了機器，一天出品幾百雙，替代了幾個人手工合作，一天出品没有幾多雙，自然價值廉賤無疑。」</p>
<p>一番明白的解釋，立刻把這樁交易成就了。在我們取了新鞋出門的時候，我在眼梢睨見那個來路夥計面上勝利的沾沾自喜之色，似乎也有爲他祖國工藝發達自傲之意。可是我的感想中，只覺得這個遠涉重洋來謀生的人兒，給巨大的機器奪去了生路，還不自覺，正有些可憐，對照着我國人的獻納金錢以增益外國的富强，甘於目前的虚榮和享樂，也不過是五十步和一百步之比罷？</p>
<h3>重見光明</h3>
<p>— 月</p>
<p>短篇小説</p>
<h3>楊二步額間的皺紋</h3>
<p>— 蝶衣</p>
<p>楊二叔在鳴凰鎭西街上，要算是唯一的小康之家了。他有着五十多畝田，這在鄉間，是很談得上的了。</p>
<p>每天早晨，楊二叔拾了他那把瓦沙茶壺，上中街茶館子，洗過臉之後，便喝起釅濃的茶，茶葉是上好的武彝，是楊二叔自備的；一面他又慢慢地磕起西瓜子；而談鋒之健，全茶館子裏也往往數楊二叔第一，他老是那麽很高興地</p>
<p>但是，不幸的幸運漸漸地降臨到楊二叔身上了！一年遇着大兵過境，楊二叔忙着指派他所負擔的一切供應，使楊二叔感受到深重的損失</p>
<p>這一年，田裏倒是豐收的，但又出乎意料的穀價大賤，收入轉大不如往年。</p>
<p>接連着，又是兩年水災，田裏的稻，全給水淹死了！再下一年，又逢着大旱災，田裏成了龜圻，收成是一都没有。</p>
<p>本來每年春夏兩季，靠着養養蠶，也可賺數十塊錢，但是因着絲業的不景氣，繭行也没有人開，繭子没有出路，又是重大的影響。</p>
<p>而更不幸的，便是楊二嫂害了三個多月的很利害的紅眼睛病，求醫，服藥之外，再是求丹方，向觀音庵許願，化費了六十幾塊錢，纔保住了楊二嫂的眼睛没有瞎，漸漸地恢復了光明</p>
<p>在這樣的連年重重交困之下，楊二叔歷年辛勞所積存下來的一些錢，不但化用殆盡，而且還背上了一身的債。</p>
<p>於是，中街上茶館子裏，也就很少聽到楊二叔健旺的談話聲音了！</p>
<p>不久，楊二叔的第二個兒子就要娶媳婦，而次女也快要出閣了。雖然在這樣的荒年，凡事不妨簡單一點，但兒子新房裏的傢具，女兒的嫁妝，是少不得要採辦的，這樣，又得耗去不少的錢。</p>
<p>楊二叔想將他的那頭水牛賣掉，但在這樣的年成，大家都在跟楊二叔一樣的打算，又有誰來買他的牛？</p>
<p>最後，楊二叔祇有割捨自己的一部分田，售給人家，來解决目下所有的困難。</p>
<p>在往年，每畝田至少可以值二百塊錢的，現在五十塊錢一畝都没人要。楊二叔好容易託了人，又自己數次的奔走，費掉無數的唇舌，纔算和東街藥店裏的邵老闆談妥了，六畝田，作價二百五十圓，在訂立過契約之後，楊二叔的六畝田，便换了主人了。</p>
<p>二百五十塊錢中，還却了一部分不可再延宕的債務，所餘也就不多了。楊二叔每天愁慮着，往下的日子怎樣過下去？</p>
<p>本來，楊二叔一個很壯碩的身子，有着光彩的臉，現在却常常害病，而額間也起了幾條甚深的皺紋了！</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>吃茶文學論</h3>
<p>— 再青</p>
<p>吃茶是一件「雅事」，但這雅事的特權者，是屬於「山人」「名士」者流。所以往古以來，談論這件事最起勁，而又可考的，多屬此輩。若夫鄉曲小子，販夫走卒，即使在疲乏之餘，也要跑進小茶館裏去喝點茶，那祇是休息與解渴，說不上「品」，也說不上「雅」的。至於採茶人，根本上就談不上有好茶可喝，能以留下一些「茶末」「茶梗」，來供自己和親鄰們享受，已經不是茶區裏的「凡人」了。</p>
<p>然而山人名士，不僅要吃好茶，還要寫吃茶的詩，很精緻的刻「吃茶文學」的集子。陸羽「茶經」以後，我們有的是講吃茶的書。曾經看到一部明刻的「茶集」收了唐以後的吃茶的文與詩，書前還刻了唐伯虎的兩頁「煮泉圖」以及當時許多文壇名人的題詞。吃茶還需要好的泉水，從這「煮泉圖」的題名上，也就可以想到。因此，當時講究吃茶的名士，遥遠地雇了專船去惠山運泉，是時見於典籍，雖然丘長孺爲這件事，使「品茶」的人曾經狼狽過一回，鬧了一點把江水當名泉的笑話。</p>
<p>鍾伯敬寫過一首「採雨詩」，有小序云：「雨連日夕，忽忽無春，採之瀹洺，色香可奪惠泉。其法用白布，方五六尺，繫其四角，而石壓其中央，以收四至之水，而置甕中庭受之。避雷者，惡其不潔也。終夕緦緦焉，慮水之不至，則亦不復知有雨之苦矣。以欣代厭，亦居心轉境之一道也。」在無可奈何之中，居然給他想出這樣的方法，採雨以代名泉，爲吃茶，其用心之苦，是可以概見了；張宗子坐在閔老子家，不吃到他的名茶不去，而祇耗去一天，又算得什麽呢？</p>
<p>還有，所以然愛吃茶，是好有一比的。愛茶的理由，是和「愛佳人」一樣。享樂自己，也是裝點自己。記得西門度愛上了桂姐，第一次在她家請客的時候，應伯爵看西門那樣的色情狂，在上茶的時候，曾經用首「朝天子」調兒的「茶詞」開他玩笑。那詞道「這細茶的嫩芽，生長在春風下。不揪不採葉兒渣。但煮着顔色大。絕品清奇，難描難畫。日兒裏常時時呷，醉了時想他，醒來時愛他。原來一簍兒千金價」。拿茶比佳人，正說明了他們對於兩者認識的一致性，雖說其間也相當的有不同的地方。</p>
<p>話雖如此，吃茶究竟也有先决的條件，就是生活安定。張大復是一個最會吃茶的人了，在他的「全集」裏「筆談」裏，若果把講吃茶的文章獨立起來，也可以印成一本書。比他研究吃茶更深刻的，也許是没有吧。可是，當他正在研究吃茶的時候，妻子也竟要來麻煩他，說廚巳無米，使他不得不放下吃茶的大事，去找買米煮飯的錢，而發一頓感歎。</p>
<p>從城隍廟冷攤上買回的一册日本的殘本「近世叢語」，裏面寫得是更有趣了。說是：「山僧嗜茶，有樵夫日過焉，僧輒茶之。樵夫曰：「茶有何德，而師嗜之甚也？」僧曰：「飮茶有三益，消食一也，除睡二也，寡慾三也」。樵夫曰：「師所謂三益者，皆非小人之利也。夫小人樵蘇以給食，豆粥藜羹。懂以充腹，若嗜消食之物，是未免飢也。明而動，晦而休，晏眠熟寐，徹明不覺，雖南面王之樂莫尚之也，欲嗜除睡之物，是未免勞苦也。小人有妻，能與小人共貧窶者，以有同寢之樂也，若嗜寡慾之物，是令妻不能安貧也。夫如此，則三者皆非小人之利也，敢辭。」可見，吃茶也並不是人人能享到的「清福」，除掉那些高官大爵，山人名士的一類。</p>
<p>新文人中，談吃茶，寫吃茶文學的，也不乏人。最先有死在「風不知向那一方面吹」的詩人徐志摩等，後有做吃茶文學運動，辦吃茶雜誌的孫福熙等，不過，徐詩人的「吃茶論」已經成了他全集的佚稿，孫畫家的雜誌，也似乎好久不曾繼續了，留下最好的一羣，大概是祇有「且到寒齋吃苦茶」的苦茶奄主周作人的一個系統。周作人從「雨天的書」時代（１９２５）開始作「吃茶」到「看雲集」出版（１９３３），是還在「吃茶」，不過在「五十自夀」（１９３４）的時候，他是指定人「吃苦茶」了。吃茶而到吃苦茶，其吃茶程度之高，是可知的，其不得已而吃茶，也是可知的，然而，我們不能不欣羡，不斷的國内外砲火，竟没有把周作人的茶菴，茶壺，和茶碗打碎呢，特殊階級的生活是多麽穩定啊。</p>
<p>八九年前，芥川龍之介遊上海，他曾經那樣的諷刺着九曲橋上的「茶客」；李鴻章時代，外國人也有看「中國人的「吃茶」，就可以看到這個國度無救」的預言。然而現在，即是就智識階級言，不僅有「寄沉痛於苦茶者」，也有厭膩了中國茶，而提倡吃外國茶的呢。這眞不能不令人有康南海式的感歎了：「嗚呼」！吾欲無言！</p>
<h3>賣糕聲</h3>
<p>— 馬星野</p>
<p>深夜最使人感到悲凉的，在前幾個月是徂雁的無力聲音，到了冬天，雁聲已不大聽到了，每夜，在你，不睡或睡得不深的時候，總會聽到弄子裏的賣糕聲。隔壁人家常常打牌，有時打到天亮，因此賣糕的知道這邊有好主顧，在深夜三點鐘四點鐘的時候，還曼聲無力的唱着賣糕，聲音裏充滿着悲凉的情調。</p>
<p>近來，在圖書館的時間多些，腦子用得疲勞，睡眠反而失常起來。以前我的校醫曾告訴過我，在睡前拚命跑了一二里的路，回來納頭便睡，一定會一眠不知曉的。過去也曾試過，也曾生效，然而到了南京以後，你能够到什麽地方發瘋一樣的跑呢？馬路上充滿泥漿，弄巷裏充滿着煤氣，在房子中亂走，妨害樓下朋友們的睡。</p>
<p>怕聽也愛聽賣糕的聲音，因爲賣糕聲音透來，表示夜已很深，而在多少人類已經享受着他天賦的睡眠權利的時候，我是不幸的被遺棄者。我不怨恨着，因爲那曼聲無力地唱着的，他被生活壓迫着，而在寒風冷露當中，眼睜睜地讓可愛的睡眠機會放過去，在他看來，我總算是一個比較幸福者。我不知不覺的對於賣糕人發生無名的友感。我往往張着眼等待着這個聲音的到來。往往等得很久而聲音還未透進弄子來，我便担心着：或者他今天害上病，或者在演夜，出了什麽危險了。</p>
<p>近來房子收拾得十分乾凈，心兒没有什麽擾亂，腦子也没有什麽懷想，獨自張着略略乾燥了的雙眼，向四壁無目的地望着，如果夜不是太漆黑的話，我也可以看見壁上許多地圖，嚴重地向我扳着臉孔。火爐中的火已盡，鐵絲窗小孔中鑽進一線線一絲絲的寒風來。這時世界上只有一個我，我無力的把我的身體放在床上，平平穩穩的讓床子支持我全部體重和心虚的重量，我的心如止水，如深淵，那緩緩的悲凉的賣糕聲，像冷酒冲進淡水裏，慢慢地透進去，沈下去。</p>
<p>我也往往在深夜中聽到喇叭的聲音，也曾在似睡非睡中聽過古寺的鐘聲，然而都不像賣糕者的聲音那樣使我難忘。日本人某某曾寫過一篇深夜的喇叭，由喇叭聲而回憶到不少戰爭的恐怖。當我在中學時代，讀了那篇小說，曾非常感動，可是那時自己没有失眠的經騐，不能體會出牠的全部妙處來，四五年前在南京時候，便漸漸能了解這篇文字的意義。明代的文徵明有一篇醮樓鼓聲記，從鼓聲中體會出許多人間的不幸者的心情，當我在去夏回家，靜居二十多天的時候，城東的仙壇寺，常常在半夜敲鐘擊鼓，于是我知道文徵明當年的心境了。時光漸漸地送着我，使我能够了解他人心境的能力漸漸的進步。人生是一枝梅，枝上簇滿着許多悲歡，而這鐘聲，喇叭聲，和賣糕聲，也算是這一枝梅上的幾點小小花蕊吧。</p>
<p>黄仲則是一個天才詩人，他的頽廢是我最以爲要不得的，雖然是很可同情。在他許多清而且美如清宵鶴唳般的小詩裏我很喜讀這一首：「朝來小雨夢難成，是處溪頭聽賣餳。怪底桃花半零落，江村明日又清明」到底「餳簫」；是怎樣一種聲音，我還没有知道，然而我很能體會他雨宵不寐，而驚清明之又至的情境。這種意境，和那「小樓一夜聽春雨，深巷明朝賣杏花」的完全不同。一個是不願意清明之到來，一個是對于明朝賣杏花的，感到濃厚的興趣，和懷着温暖的樂意，</p>
<p>我不知道那賣糕的會是一個老者或是一個少年，如果是少年，他聲音中至少已帶着成人的悲哀。我不知道他什麽時候才可以去睡，我自己在五點鐘或四點鐘，總會矇矇矓矓睡去的。白天的時候，當我已經在圖書館裏坐着，或者在火爐邊靠着火的時候，那賣糕的不知在什麽地方，我希望他能够得到一陣甜美的睡眠。</p>
<h3>黔行散記（下）</h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>過婁山關</p>
<p>在湫溢的小房子里，能點着五六個燈，烟霧騰騰地瀰漫着：</p>
<p>「今天一盆不够了，等會得賣氣力呢！」</p>
<p>「咱倆再分一盆吧，哼，過婁山關，三上三下，够受的。」</p>
<p>這小房子里，不必貼什麽「莫談國是」的告白，雖則他們的話都是些雜亂無章的，甚至前十年的事實和後幾年的玄想都曾極輕鬆的在他們的嘴里流露着，但，「國是」對他們是無緣的，他們不去理會誰同誰交惡，某和某聯歡，這些，像與已無關的身外物一樣。</p>
<p>「還不紥，日頭跨上半天啦，這一羣龜兒𡂿！伕頭急了，挨着這條村鎭上的長街搜索着，從東面直到西面。</p>
<p>彷彿一陣急流的漩渦，人，由不同的口子里向着當中奔去。</p>
<p>「今天過關多賣點力，晚上到棧去打牙祭。（註）」伕頭笑着，像給他們一付興奮的安慰。</p>
<p>起行了，浩浩蕩蕩地，在這條悠長的山路上，我們這一羣進發着。</p>
<p>路上，也可以看到來往的客人，至少，背貨的驢子是可以看到許多的。不通洋船，不通火車，一切，都需要藉重牠們的體力來輸運日常的需要。</p>
<p>除掉落棧，打尖，在這山道上也是重要的，大站十里八里，小站三里五里，數目雖不怎樣準確，然而，跑償了的人，是可以預計出到什麽地方吃飯，到什麽地方歇脚的。在預計確定了以後，除了達到預定的地方以外，其他的站頭是很少停留的。</p>
<p>山窩里的自然景色，怪可愛的，叢濃的樹，秀綠的山，清澄的澗流，層疊的山田，還有坑坎的茫茫的路，都在我們這一夥的脚下溜去了，溜去了。然而，「望山似跑馬」看着没有多遠的婁山關，竟走了三個多鐘頭還不能走到。</p>
<p>又打了一回尖，附帶的又吃了點東西，這樣，開始邁進了關山的路。這婁山并不如何的高，不過，石級是比較着竪立點，能抽拉着行者的脚腿發着酸麻，讓全部的氣力，都疲糜下去。</p>
<p>第二個山頭比較着高了，最高的，要算末一個。本來，在平常的兩山距離中，總有着一些平坦的路的，而這婁山關却在連續的上來又下去，使疲糜的身子不能有一點蘇解的餘暇，這，也許就是被認爲艱困的一點吧？</p>
<p>很不容易的爬到了最後的山頂上，不覺的，我們共同吁了一口氣，坐了下來，太陽已經偏西了。</p>
<p>伕頭的臉上透着笑，嘴里在哼着！</p>
<p>婁山上行高又深，</p>
<p>肩擔物重沉更沉，</p>
<p>三上三下十八里，</p>
<p>汗濕衣襟，累死人。</p>
<p>註：滑杆，黔行的坐輿。油布，在坐輿的頂上必舖油布，以防隂雨。牙祭，犒勞的意思。；</p>
<h3>棄婦</h3>

<h3>人間世（三）</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>這回，不用我的朋友回答我，我也知道是什麽地方了，因爲一進屋，讓我嗅到了濃重的大烟味，這不是大烟館是什麽。但是，烟館應該開設在熱鬧的大街上才對，才能招攬顧客呀，開在黑巷中哪能有生意。就我在正陽街上見到的幾家烟館，不但門面輝煌，燈光燦爛，並且還特别有些站在門口兜攬生意的人，你一從他們身前經過，他們就會向你說：</p>
<p>「原漿土，原漿貨；抽一口，眞好過」。</p>
<p>或是：</p>
<p>「烟味好，别家比不了；烟泡大，抽烟减半價」。</p>
<p>這裏旣然是烟館，那麽，我的朋友爲什麽就不說明呢？這中間難道說還有某種難言的隱情存在着？</p>
<p>我們先走進一間黑暗的堂屋，接着又走進堂屋右手一間小屋，我的朋友在黑屋中走着，比走巷中黑路還要熟上幾倍，儼若這裏就是他自己的家。黑暗中我看出靠窗一面有一舖炕。我的先導往炕上黑暗中抓了一把，隨即抓出來一絲尖細的女人叫喊聲，我才知道炕上躺有一個女人。女人在這時開口了：</p>
<p>「是曹爺？怎麽，家裏太太放鬆了你？」</p>
<p>這句話，含有濃重的酷意，但是說來這樣率直，任何人都會猜得出這個女人的身分的。</p>
<p>一盞豆粒大的煤油燈，讓跟着我們進屋來的小姑娘點着了，我仔細把屋中打量一下：是烟館，毫無疑問丨丨炕上放置的五六個烟盤子就是最有力的證據。這女人，約有二十四五歳，她那種邊幅不修而又潑辣的樣子，分明是個女光棍，還是一個雅片烟吸食者。一句話，她是一個要人的。</p>
<p>我的朋友說話了：</p>
<p>「說這一套幹什麽，什麽放鬆不放鬆的，要不你也不天天留我住」。</p>
<p>說這種話，確是有些刺耳，可是在她這種身分的女人面前說出來，你也不能說是侮辱她，反之，她倒願意你能同她說些同類的話，好開開心。她正好，聽了我的朋友說的話，更進一步地哭着說：</p>
<p>「你有大洋就行，十天半月隨你住」。</p>
<p>這裏是烟館，丨丨是私烟館，這裏同時又是私娼。</p>
<p>我完全明白了這個地方了。</p>
<p>「得啦，說閒話没有用，我來給你介紹一個顧客罷，」我的朋友照她的臉上揑了一把，說。「這是我的朋友黎未行，警察廳某某股主任；這是」他笑着給我指點着她，「這是我的相好的罷，我的相好的郝小蘭。」</p>
<p>更正：前日刊登「明末的反山人文學」一文，薛岡恨山人不過，改「山人」爲「山雞」，誤排爲「山雜」，特此更正。</p>

<h3>洋拆步鬆收解無多</h3>
<p>昨日市塲中洋拆市價、以頭寸充裕無人受理、致價格下落、形勢大鬆、較前日市價又小五分、計爲一角五分、亦爲上年底之特殊創舉、今年獻中歳第一聲之好氣象也、劃頭加水、自三四分逐小至一二分、而亦供多求少、結果而至於濫、拆票交易、早市轉賬一百三十餘萬、新交易五十餘萬、午市交易四十餘萬、小總會中交易七十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖六十餘萬、新做出八十餘萬、鈔票收回八十餘萬、發出流通券四十餘萬、暗記券九十餘萬、客路來源三十萬、去胃四十萬、銀行收解外商銀行收解票欵一百三十餘萬、各種貨匯押墊雜欵二百七八十萬、、外匯結價欵五十餘萬、年結欵一百八十餘萬、特匯欵四十餘萬、電匯欵四十餘萬、進倉四十萬、華商銀行收解票欵一百九十餘萬、各種貨滙税雜諸欵四百十餘萬、特滙欵八十餘萬、外滙結價欵一百三十餘萬、年結欵一百三十餘萬、進倉五十萬、日商銀行收解票欵二百零數萬、各種貨滙雜欵收解四百二十餘萬、外匯結價欵五十餘萬、年結欵二百二十餘萬、出倉八十萬、錢莊洋公單收解二千九百餘萬、洋劃頭欵收解六百二十餘萬、各路滙欵六十餘萬、收解現欵直、又本市票據交换所十七日交换總數、銀元九百三十一萬九千六百六十五元零一分、内計銀元四百七十四萬八千九百六十九元五角一分、滙劃銀元四百五十七萬零六百九十五元五角、</p>
<h3>江角小同行居奇抬價</h3>
<p>昨日江南小洋、早市爲八百四十六元、午市爲八百六十元、結果兩市計差十四元之巨、緣去胃方面、又有人報裝、故小同行又勒索居奇、下午市價、遂而抬高、做出交易、早市一千角、午市六千角、廣東小洋、早市爲七百五十五元二角、午市爲七百五十五元、兩市計差二角之微、交易早市十三萬五千角、午市五萬角、銅元微縮五百文、爲三百零八千五百文、做出交易三萬三千五百三十五串、合代價洋一萬一千元、</p>
<h3>證劵散户傾抛公債盤旋轉疲</h3>
<p>昨華商證劵交易所、市面盤旋轉疲、洋拆續鬆、祗一角五分、而人心則仍係疲莫能興、零星散户之賣出、仍屬絡繹不絕、市氣與環境背道而馳、市上並有英美銀借欵兩萬萬之謡、事實雖相去甚遠、但不得不謂爲好消息、而人心之不振、仍不外年關及交易税關係、似此一再盤旋不巳、醖釀過久、當有變化、目下因交易過清、其趨勢如何、尚難捉摸也、昨日經過、趨勢幾爲逐盤帶疲、頭盤跌落稍多者、二盤即稍稍回上、頭盤未有上落者、次盤又小去五分一角、沉悶情形、令人生厭、午後收盤、稍見混沌、高低互見、本月份交易、祇餘一週、此後諒可稍形活動、綜計市價結果、繼續疲落五分一角至三四角不等、成交總數、計共八百九十九萬一千元、兹將其漲跌結果、列比較表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>紐約股市稍稍回升</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告、昨（十六日）紐約股市、開出略升、此後即轉平靜、因外匯市面巳恢復秩序、故股價始終堅定、較前日計漲數角至二元光景、除金銀股祇微升外、其餘恢復前日之損失者頗多、交易者已將前日之跌予以折扣、目下靜待最高法院之判决、債市呆滯、價頗參差、美政府公債略疲、小交易所股票堅挺、本日小麥亦漲、温尼沛方面通告、謂前日設立之價格維持、將繼續有效云、全日成交六十七萬股、兹將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>

<h3>紗花紗花浮空稍有補進</h3>
<p>紗市微現堅象、因市塲流言、謂通濟公司王某對於本月份紗有收貨數千包之訊、又有一說、廠商因棉貴紗賤、虧負殊鉅、在廢歷年頭年尾間、或者有提早停工、遲緩開車、因此人心震盪、浮空抵補、市盤稍見振作矣、</p>
<h3>金雞微升</h3>
<p>標紗前市開盤、形勢即堅、市塲上傳言紛紜、利於多頭空氣、又見濃厚、故買者略多、浮空抵補而堅、各月均漲二三四五角、午後市情仍屬平靜、無十分進展之狀、但大户之多頭態度、異常安定、檯面上籌碼枯乾、結果近平、遠漲二四角、查賣出達記二百五十包、愼記二百五十包、長豐四百包、恒昌二百五十包、德記二百五十包、大昶三百五十包、買進新昌六百包、賡豐四百五十包、遠大二百五十包、瑞大二百五十包、德記三百包、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>棉市轉堅、但印棉猛落、翁默拉一種狂跌六羅比、本埠市塲未受若何影響、足見人心一斑、實則本月份成交額量、尚剩九萬餘擔、交貨方面、大概尚未準備充足、遠期亦激高、市價乃漲矣、</p>
<h3>鄭標小俏</h3>
<p>標花前市開盤、尚屬平澹、因印棉大跌、人心看疲、而金價亦平、本應看跌者佔多數、無奈本月份因交貨問題而轉緊、但拍至收盤、近月又落、結果近平、遠月漲一角、至一角半、午後開盤仍軟、聞印棉暗盤續跌、但人氣尚緊、因本月份交割期限接近、空方漸漸抵進、市盤較挺、遠月帶高、收盤時突轉良好、各月均漲一角至一角半、查賣出源大八百担、達大一千八百担、愼記一千一百担、長豐一千六百担、新亨八百担、長和一千六百担、瑞大一千九百担、買進同孚一千一百担工裕康九百担工大豐二千二百担、永昌一千三百担、通記一千担、愼昌一千担、同興一千四百担、潤康一千二百担、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<p>又一月期紗花交割、現定三十日舉行、一月期交易亦於二十六日起停拍、</p>
<h3>美棉近漲遠跌</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、因經紀商多頭了結、各月跌一至五磅音、但人心對金條文案之恐慌巳稍减、有人視一九三五年棉産額定一千二百萬包而售出、旋因華爾街買進、並傳産棉額僅定一千零五十萬包而猛漲、收盤時、現貨商售出、市價稍疲、計現貨跌五磅音、近期漲四至七磅音、遠期跌二至四磅音、英棉市况衰頽、現貨跌九點、期貨跌六點、印棉初因投機家買進而堅、後因日商賣出及棉農套售而軟、計平果爾跌二·七五羅比、奥姆辣跌六羅比、白羅溪漲七角半、原電錄左、（十六日電）</p>

<h3>糧食期粉交易甚爲清淡</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、上午開盤後、各月份市面、大致平定、以洋麥報價、芝加哥回漲四五六角不等、坎拿大漲四分至五角零、交易甚爲清淡、半日中祗做八萬餘包、因買户觀望、且現洋麥之定價、依然鬆動、故人心未能振作也、迨至下午開盤、近遠期市面、忽又下跌頗狂、據市塲所傳、廠家又定成洋麥二船、價祗四元八角一分、由福阜兩家定去、是以抛貨大暢、一部分之浮多、亦亟於脱手、因此遠期跌度、竟達三分外、觀察後步、仍看洋麥定價爲轉移也、結果本月份跌二分七厘半、二月份跌二分半、三月份跌三分、四五月份跌三分半、六月份跌三分二厘半云、</p>
<h3>期現麥市面平疲</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、洋麥報價、雖芝加哥漲四五六角、坎拿大好四分至五角零、當開價時、以結賬日近業内外交易、均無形减少、故洋麥雖好、局面不過平靜而已、迨至下午開盤、本月份因浮空略補、市面平穩、遠期初亦挺住、後以粉市轉跌、洋麥又有定開二船之說、則此後標凖、或重有套賣、故人心又呈軟弱也、結果本月份好二分、二月份小二分、三月份不動、四月份小二分、現麥市面、價亦軟弱、因洋麥續定、廠胃不貪、開山東麥三元九角、有一千包交易云、</p>
<p>芝加哥小麥、本日市面對壓力頗能抵抗、廠家採辦現貨頗多、</p>
<p>芝加哥　一月十五日收　　一月十六日收　上落</p>

<h3>洋米産地有報漲說</h3>
<p>昨日本客銷胃甚活、内地暢辦次機米與碎米、本街貪辦高機米、故全市開出高機米西貢暹邏一號米五千包、内地去碎米及三號米六千包、市面頗見挺俏、又值暹邏西貢産地報漲、且洋米定貨登記亦將限期停止、故本客辦胃更貪、貨主一再扳俏、現洋米又見步升一角、客秈被洋米帶起五分、交易亦見活潑、全市開五千包、亦由本街内地分去云、（按如因停止登記、而米商乘機抬價、究屬不是）</p>
<h3>河下米後市轉風</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源共到七十餘號、（貨共萬二三千石）、故人心愈餒、銷塲奇滯、售方欲求速脱、祇有跌價之一途、於是相互喊低、跌風立熾、形勢殊爲紊亂、嗣經本街暢進、客路青島帮亦續辦五六百包、結果各貨行情見跌二三角、而有貨者巳脱售大半矣、至若杜尖及隂元等各花色、亦小一二角不等、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源三四十號、市上銷路仍呆、市價白粳中次價小一角、薄稻變元亦小角外、餘貨均趨下遊之象、</p>
<h3>芝蔴洋莊銷路仍有</h3>
<p>丨丨黄荳銷活續漲丨丨</p>
<p>昨日黄荳市况、承上日之漲風、行情繼升、廠家前日售出大批餅後、其荳胃尚不呆、計辦去大連四平街荳十車、價爲四元零一分、及蚌埠荳一車、本街及内地等採去漢口乍荳二千餘包、大連范禹屯荳二百包、沙市荳二百餘包、漢遲荳二百五十餘包、通州帮辦去頴州荳一車、刻下大勢因到存兩稀、市態平定、芝蔴洋莊貨續開五百噸、由沙遜辦去、價開九元九角半、鎭江帮採去一百噸、價爲九元九角、現貨東洋帮及行號採做凈貨之胃尚聯、故市面穩立、</p>
<h3>麩皮客帮亦乏採辦</h3>
<p>麩皮市面、因洋麥不動、内地帮則以結賬日近、非有急需者、均少進意、故回籠貨市氣軟弱、頗有逐疲之勢、昨開阜豐麩二元六角半、福新麩二元六角二分、</p>
<h3>南北貨　生仁復見上升</h3>
<p>生仁咋青島電訊回漲、申市因之隨緊、而廣帮銷路亦見活動、昨共成一百十噸、如開封仁週二開過七元二角者、昨開七元四角、好起二角、歸德仁六元六角、徐州仁叫升二三角、未成、市勢頗覺堅穩、</p>
<h3>厦生曬肉漲五六角</h3>
<p>厦門生曬圓肉、近期輪絕無運到、查市上存底本稀、號貨更缺、故趨勢轉緊、兼之現在較高之貨、本街頗有需要、故開價好起五六角、均爲行方做進、號貨業已告罄、後批待到、如果身份乾燥、色光紅亮、而無烏片者、後市尚防續緊、</p>
<h3>糖市　粗砂白降去角半</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、粗砂白因關金見降、且現貨增而去胃减、價乃復跌、國産潮青亦有微鬆、公會划盤、二四粗砂白現貨普通十八元七角、比前日跌去角半、轉口貨五元四角半、不動、八九號荷赤叫十三元九角、無成交、太古糖Ｂ嘜十九元二角、比前日又小五分、本廠綿白無變動、一號仍爲十八元三角、號盤有潮帮開出潮青二千餘包、價爲十二元八角至十元二角、廣帮開出祝青一百包、價爲十元二角、昨廣東輪由汕入口、到有潮青及枝洋枝赤等糖二千九百三十二包、</p>
<h3>疋頭天寒大衣生意激增</h3>
<p>邇來天氣突轉寒冷、呢絨大衣生意因之驟增、大新街一帶現買男女大衣、均非常暢盛、然對於進料方面、則依然鮮少、蓋爲時巳晚、大半均預謀結束、故除相率推銷自己存貨外、未有再多添配、致大路呢絨市面、仍無轉佳之象、</p>
<h3>絲茶上半月出口之絲經統計</h3>

<h3>油市　洋莊白桐油滬漢均動</h3>
<p>白桐油自漢市轉緊後、漢行開進客貨即加至襄桐每擔二十六元以上客規、售洋莊欲漲至三十二元洋規、而洋行雖心有未服、然因來源不湧、求過於供、需貨之家、總未能久持也、本埠售洋行者貨亦不少、據前昨兩日共有三百噸出口、係前抛售之貨、近日亦有數十百噸交易、價格每擔三十二元四角、連鐵桶關税、大概須下月交貨矣、惟本埠洋行所進、乃是浙桐、自新貨産後迄今、巳有千餘噸交易、未解者數亦不少、浙桐産數雖年有增加、若照洋莊需求如此之殷、仍是供不敷求、所以杭州市面足度貨已提至每砠二十七元二角送申、則二三日内巳加起一元以外、總是受滬上洋交之影響也、</p>
<h3>五金　黑頁鐵幾爲落令品</h3>
<p>黑頁鐵自旺到後、市上存貨即告充斥、出路因津帮進辦、烟青威海衛諸帮亦少點綴、市象異常冷落、本街搪磁廠因美貨黄鷹牌紛紛裝到、故亦無採買、幾爲五金品中之落令花色、查昨市交易祇有三四十扎、行情三尺六尺每担估九元二三角、二尺六尺每扎售九元一二角不一、</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>犧牲的代價</h3>
<p>— 無聊</p>
<p>我國古來的人生哲學，有許多明訓敎條，所謂「明哲保身。」「所謂知命者不立乎巖牆之下。」所謂「千金之子，坐不垂堂。」等等，都是見機而作，保障生命的妥當辦法。其比較更有意義而發明超人哲學的，就是孟子說「生亦我所欲也，義亦我所欲也，二者不可得兼，舍生而取義者也。」後來宋儒發揮此義，更有所謂「失節事大餓死事小」等等，他們看節看義，比較生命來得重要，此外身外之物，便没有比生命來得重要的，此東方文化之邦，其禮敎所以獨冠千古也。</p>
<p>外人到底是野蠻，他們看人生，並不是這樣重要，只要事業的成功，生命儘可置諸度外。他們冐險的精神，志多的偉大，不怕千難萬難，定要不顧一切去幹。卽如同温層探險，南北極探險，飛機飛渡大西洋，飛行環球一週等，他們不懂得生命的危險，只知道目的之能達，我國近來的青年，對於人生哲學，也稍微看透一些了。所以對於自己的生命，也並不十分重視，所以自殺的案件，也層見迭出，不勝枚舉。但一究其自殺的原因，不外兩種，（一）經濟壓迫，二是失戀，或爲經濟壓迫而不能達戀愛的目。此外不曾聽見有特别有價值的犧牲。試問這樣的犧牲有什麽價值的存在。</p>
<p>但近日確眞進步了，試一翻近日報紙，不曾有步行家潘德明行將返國麽？不曾見小學生環游全國的壯舉麽？不曾見我國女飛行家自爪拉隆坡飛至新加坡麽？的確，這幾位都有冐險的精神不能說絕對没有絲毫的意義，這是我深爲欽佩的。但現在是飛行的世界，不是步行的世界，這種環游步行的舉動，祗有增進個人的閱歷和見識，而對於社會國家，實無趣大的供獻。至於女飛行家的飛行，自爪拉隆坡飛至新加坡，僅有二百餘哩，自我人觀之，已是了不起的事，然自外人觀之，則尚卑卑不足道也。</p>
<p>但這種事情，在我國確眞已認爲難得的壯舉了。我國人的性質，往往處誹笑派的態度，他們事業成功，只有嫉妬而猜忌。不成，便多方的冷嘲熱諷。所以有人欲幹一件事，先要考慮其能否成功，成功還可，如其不成，便要被傍人嘲笑。這樣一來，欲幹辦這事的勇氣，便會無影無蹤的消失了。所以欲幹一事，不必問其成功與失敗，祗要問其應幹和不應幹，如其認爲應幹的事，我便放胆做去。成敗固屬不計，笑駡亦是由他！才能幹出驚人的事情，才能達最後勝利的目的。</p>
<h3>我第一次認識冬天</h3>
<p>— 石靜波</p>
<p>祖父是一個非常和氣的老人，身體又高又大，正是北方人中最典型的大漢子，長鬍鬚，有幾根黄金的發亮光，其餘都是蒼白的，茸突突的，裝修得他那和藹可親近的臉，格外令人尊敬。</p>
<p>他以非常辛苦的和卓越的忍耐力處理他極複雜的家務，在那龐然複雜的家庭中，他的確做成功了，是一個最有毅力的標凖人物。後來，他又運用這種力，創造他自己的家業，品格，和帶有民族意義的歷史，從一個衰落了的商人家庭之下掙扎起來，發奮讀書，並且敎導我的大伯父和我的父親也讀書，二伯父和三伯種田，自己的田不够種，就租人家的田種。雖然他的家業没有完成他美滿的希望，可是在人生的，奮鬥意義的基點上，他獲得了全部社會的尊敬和信仰。</p>
<p>在六十一歳的那一年，他因爲不可救藥的腦充血去世了。那時我只五歳，就在這個時候，我第一次認識了冬天的面目。</p>
<p>在十二月初七日的夜裏，他和大伯父和父親，不知道從什麽地方回來，我記得，那是一個很冷的夜，祖母帶我在院心裏望對面的石道坡，終於望到他們回來了。我第一個望見石道坡盡頭，出現了微微閃照的亮光，祖母就斷定是祖父們回來了。果然，我們開開大門，眞的是祖父們回來了。閃照的亮光，原來是他們的紙燈籠。</p>
<p>後來的事情，我記不清楚了。影影忽忽的，好像是祖父抱我到媽媽房裏去睡，可是我什麽都不知道了。</p>
<p>不知道誰又抱我到另一個房子裏，我驚醒了。我立刻感覺到一種驚天動地的大事情，在我的睡夢中暴發了。悽慘，悲痛，絕呌的空氣，立刻把我抓住，死也不肯放手。我得了非常沈重的傷寒</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>病。這病，立刻傳染給我的大哥。</p>
<p>我住的是我母親的産房。一個炕上，睡着我的母親，新生下來的妹妹，兩個害重傷寒病的大哥和我，還有我的六七十歳的外祖母。有時候，我的祖母和大姨媽也搭着睡。很奇怪的，這樣一個骯髒齷齪的爛臭世界，竟然我們的傷寒病没有再傳染給第三人。</p>
<p>等到我恢復了知覺的時候，我的祖父巳經被人們埋葬了。我看見我的母親蓋着被子坐在炕足頭，聽見嬰兒的哭聲。我的傍邊，躺着昏迷不醒的大哥。窗户不知道蓋上了什麽東西，很難看見外面的光亮，實在悶人；可是我一點都不能動，轉折一下身子的氣力都没有了。</p>
<p>我記得這個冬天就是這樣過去的。這是我第一次認識冬天，從我有生命以來，我第一次知道有嚴寒的冬天。在人類的社會上，我第一次朦朧的和自然界發生了意識上的關係，就是我開始理會關於社會生活的季節性。</p>
<p>這季節性裏邊的冬天，對於勞苦的人們，幾乎是一種非常巨大的威嚇和蹂躪。</p>
<h3>人生的故事</h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>他第三次把煤塊加到壁爐裏去，這舉動引起了對方的笑聲。</p>
<p>壁爐裏本來發着熊熊的火燄，他接一連二的鏟煤塊進去把火燄撲滅了，反升起刺鼻的煤煙。</p>
<p>你說他生壁爐没有經騐嗎？這是相差過遠了。他能够在打氣爐上製成美味的各種菜肴，更能在電燈熄滅了之後馬上接好保險絲，補襪縫衣，在必要時，也能來一二手的，他的各種經騐可以編成一部賣錢的百科全書，所缺乏的是對付女人的手腕，而這個女人却在五分鐘前叩着他臥室的門了。</p>
<p>「到外面去走走是太冷了，然而生壁爐却没有學會這本領！」女人的假嗓子都笑出來了。</p>
<p>這句話不是没來由的：他時常爲了她的吵擾，從公寓中逃避出來，無目的地東遊西蕩，直到再不能支持疲乏的身體的時候歸寓。對於一個自己不喜歡的女人要用這樣笨拙的方法來逃避，使她更感到一種莫可言喻的刺激而日夜纏繞於他的公寓之中。</p>
<p>今夜的風勢把冬的本來面目暴露了，這自然不適宜於扶杖獨行的散步，他曾扣了幾家朋友的門，但是這些患了都市病的青年都到瘋狂的舞塲裏去厮混了。這樣，他也想趕九時一刻的電影，不過散塲後歸寓還是太早的時候，所以他懷了或許今夜例外的念頭歸寓煮茶讀書。等到他對着壁爐，躺在摇椅裏蕩曳着兩腿的時候，甬道中響起了脚步聲。</p>
<p>他的臥室是寓中的最後一間，這脚步聲，不用懷疑，在室内人聽清了的時候，已直抵門口了。果然，輕輕地扣門了，不過來客是早已預料着没有回答的，她是像一個華經理踏進買辦間似的直闖進來，脱了大衣在門背後掛好了，拖了另一個摇椅和他並肩坐着對壁爐取火。</p>
<p>主人取不理睬的態度是陳舊的手法了。在讀報時候把報紙隨意摺疊，對着壁爐時候當然是努力加煤了。</p>
<p>他聽了她諷刺話，方始抬起頭來，吐出好像凖備着的話：</p>
<p>「你不怕冷？這末多遠的路跑來！」</p>
<p>「這裏不是生着壁爐！」</p>
<p>主人答不上第二句。衝出了煤塊的火燄蛇舌似捲着兩張緋紅的臉，彼此的呼吸之外，死樣的寂寞。</p>
<p>在這幾分鐘之間，我來介紹女客的輪廓！</p>
<p>她是被稱爲什麽交際之花的，吊在她手灣間的男子，有如她的服裝一樣瞬息萬變。她是沉溺在糜爛生活中，所以她追求刺激，自然，丨男人不是最好的對象？不過，自從她發現了這位對於女人不善於詞令的他以後，她彷彿發現了世界上最有力的刺激品。於是，這公寓的一角，搬演着這幕滑稽的悲劇。</p>
<p>現在我們當然不能預測閉幕以前的結果。</p>
<p>不過人是萬物之靈。這類的把戲是到處洽如所好的　演着，大的爭鬥，小的口角，這故事可以隨心所欲的見機而作，人生如舞台，你能不信任這句話嗎？</p>

<h3>黄昏的彷徨</h3>
<p>— 阿純</p>
<p>少女有秋天的恐怖，我却頂怕那隂沉的黄昏！</p>
<p>正是一個變態的冬天，毛毛雨連綿地，没有一些兒的風。靜悄悄裏就只有鐘聲的節奏，屋子裏每個角落裏都滿佈了抓不住的空虚，獨個兒坐着，讓長衣拖着地，讓自己的心靈自由地，讓自己的思潮解放地，讓自己的儲藏着的一切，給自己一種坦白的解剖，就在這個黄昏的隂沉裏，湧上了内心的矛盾！</p>
<p>給桃色的圈子圍住了四周，一個不懂事的孩子，竟像一隻自由的小鳥一樣的獲得了莫名的愉快，當五月的薔薇展開的時候，一個美麗的春天的故事已就跟着開始了！</p>
<p>是一個初夏的傍晚，灰暗已滿佈了大地，晚風裏帶來了稀薄的雨點，遠處的閃閃燈光，和那白渡橋上來往的喧鬧，眞是一個夜都市的開始，我倆在樹下的草地上，看自己斜陽的影子消失下去，一直到江邊的浪花聞，送走了遊人仙的閒談，還在猶預的逗留之中，那時候月姑娘有些兒微光，浪花更洶湧地上前了，除了遼遠地傳來的夜都市裏的騷動，在附近還有那個亡國的呆子！漸漸地，四周已曚上了一陣模糊，一切也就跟着消失了，像是這麽大的世界上剩下的就只我們兩顆熱誠的心！没有道德的虚僞，没有殘酷的鐵衣，脱去了不自由的桎梏，我們表現了赤裸裸春天的火花，他緊握了我的手：</p>
<p>「我不離開你，純！我永遠的不離開你！」</p>
<p>「……殉」微笑着低了頭。</p>
<p>「有什麽方法永遠不離開你呢？純！」</p>
<p>「你說有什麽方法呢？」</p>
<p>「我們「那個」吧！」</p>
<p>當意會了他的用意之後，像是接到了一個意外的霹靂，眞的，没有想到的，他會那麽快就提到這個問題上去，默默地没有話說，一直等他放了我的手，給了我一個末了的吻的時候，還是默然地低了頭離開了他。</p>
<p>晚上，急促地鑽進了被窩，把被蒙住了頭，整個的一夜，找不到一個睡魔，眞的，我又浸在矛盾的苦痛中了！</p>
<p>没有受到「神聖」的騙，更没有想到什麽墳墓的來臨，只是，一個母親生活的可怕，在幻想中開始了！啊！我將不是個孩子！我將失去了自由，我將在家庭的義務生活中過去了，我又將爬上一個另外的階段了！</p>
<p>「不，我决不答應，我得延長我黄金時代！」</p>
<p>「不，我决不答應，我得不迅速地結束，我自由的生活！」</p>
<p>在内心裏是這麽肯定地下了個决心</p>
<p>第二天，就趕到他那裏，孩子地表示了些意思，說我們該延下一二年吧？</p>
<p>我想該是個冷冰的答覆對於他當我也同樣地想到「不能没有他」的時候，我又懊悔着自己的話了！</p>
<p>於今，在這個黄昏裏，給拉長了的沉思，給過去了的遺跡，給他的那個魁梧可愛的影子，使我又浸在彷徨裏了！</p>
<p>人和人中間，免不了一些類同的事情，一個女人總也脱不了那些必經的階段，我爲什麽要經質地苦着自己呢？</p>
<p>給這個結論的下塲，趕去了黄昏的彷徨！</p>
<h3>暮航</h3>
<p>— 丁蔚南</p>
<p>這是一個秋天。</p>
<p>乾涸的河水，表徵出了河床的消瘦，灰黑色的小礁石，崢嶸地露出牠底凄凉的氣息，帶來了寥落的犬吠，這是輕風裏漾來的微波。舟子們摇着詩人們所謂一葉扁舟，泛乎這淙淙泊泊的河流而上溯到古舊的城堡。所謂一葉之舟，在這些舟子們的手裏摇時，眞是比上蜀道還難，拉縴的人，在岸上駝痛了腰，把舵的人郁很吸勁，而航行的慢，仍是在這個河灣裏掙扎了一天。</p>
<p>從晨光曦微的早晨，就看見了那從地平綫上　了出來的龍潭高塔，在日出的光芒裏，沐着牠那山和雲的混和浴，偉麗地，清晰地巍立在那邊凸起的山坵上，像傲然的竹筍，也像挺直的筆桿兒；在它的旁邊有一所廟宇圍着，它是傲立在這廟的中心，屹屹然。白色的廟的圍垣，那麽低小的蹲在它底脚下，像西洋人項上的白色的領圈。在人們的視綫裏面，這塔是放出了龐大的尊嚴。那銅質的塔頂的葫蘆，在夕陽的斜照之下，它是回出了那金色的光芒，在人　的眼簾裏眩着，像海灘上的貝壳一樣，在那老遠的地平上，閃閃地顫着這傍晚裏的自然中的脈搏，孕育了夜底胚胎！</p>
<p>掙扎的人，究竟拖進了船底行程，雖然河水是乾涸的露出了骨頭。漸漸地是航近了塔底下的龍潭，河水也漸漸地的深起來了，塔是在緩緩地朝着我們挺上，輪廓是更其清晰，河水是深碧了，信拉縴的事情，仍是不能减輕用子們的</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>工作。風是輕輕的差不多吹動不起河水的微波，但，蕩起人們的身上，差不多是有很多的凉意。那邊的蘆葦雖是有點摇摇，有點飄飄，可是落在水裏的倩影，給上航的舟底浪痕，破碎了她在那水裏底柔情，她們似在低語的那些苗條的倩影！雁有時在她們的叢裏舉起牠們的飛程，是會驚動她們纖弱底靈魂，但，在她們的身上是結癥了秋的深訊，和這夜的醖釀裏底幽吟！</p>
<p>漸漸地是糢糊了，塔的雄影，倒在潭底，在這裏有許多航去與駛來的船隻，揚起白色的風帆，在這蒼茫的瞑色裏，破壞了這沐浴在潭底的塔影，摇摇地，這顫顫着的天空呵！船的艙裏面，燃起了燈，炊飯的事是在開始了。俯首望水底，祇看得見白的天空，和流的閑雲，但仔細的細看底下，黑黝黝的有點駭人，像神話中的東西，出現了在眼前，如果白的天空，和流的閑雲，都消失了的時候，那幻變的成分是不會有破滅的。</p>
<p>那個古舊的城堡，也迷離地在顯現了，月是升起來了，掛在東空。不知是何處的鐘聲，深長地敲着這踏上征塵的游子底心，每一個過客的靈魂，如果說這是不會帶上旅人的喜訊，那一定的是沉痛底悲悽的離忱！</p>
<p>航行的人都懷着驚悸的心，亂動的時代是帶來了農村裏的不寗，那邊茫茫裏古舊的城堡，是安慰人們的表徵，尤其是這個時分。茫茫的夜，節奏着淙淙的行舟的水聲，摇着月影，破着天星，載上一顆游子的心，飄上這渺茫底旅程！</p>
<h3>誘惑</h3>
<p>— 羅姗</p>
<p>（你那兒子們是吃母親的眼涙以生活，你倒底想回去不？）</p>
<p>那是個苦冷的冬天的黄昏，我正寒縮地坐在爐邊烤火，幽閒地讀着勃郎寧的抒情詩，詩，抒給我那熱戀的女人聽的。記得我做了個鬼臉呌他我那朋友丨停住了話頭，爲的是怕我們之間引起或種的誤會。我僅僅回答着一個苦笑！</p>
<p>（人生的過程是這個方式的，我的人生哲學你也明白，不是麽？這便是吾强有力的證明吾的人生哲學！）</p>
<p>委實那個朋友的話没有刺激我一根纖維，我也十分奇怪，明白曉得冬天的漠北的黄沙與颶風，屋子的搆造和不完全的設備，那情况，素患失眠症的神經衰弱者的妻底可憐，然而我没有因着那可憐而生出一滴憐愛之情來，至於孩子，在享樂主義的我更以爲那是一種負累，毫無意思的事，然而由那朋友去後的第三天晚上，在光亮的電燈下面，吾和我的情人各各低着頭看書於舒適之沙發中，我發現了一篇類似我的生活的寫眞的作品，我的心微微地顫動了下，於是開始了不安寧的生活，而幾乎把並坐於一起的女人當作魔鬼的化身，而開始咒詛着生活的盲目化，全個人主義出發點的差誤。</p>
<p>（「人」的生存於世界的最大使命不在於改少人類痛苦，多帮助人類爲天職的麽？我做下來……）</p>
<p>我的眼睛闔上了。内心受了鞭韃。</p>
<p>那是德國霍卜特曼的戲劇「沈鐘」，說述主人翁享立希被陸丹特倫迷住而忘却做人父人夫的義務，而牧師的勸他的話正和那三天前朋友勸我的話是一般地的，然而「沈鐘」的主人公直到死才想得那妻子以及吃眼涙以生活的兒子們的。我呢？</p>
<p>（我呢？主宰我的這些啊，這些虚榮和物質享受的桎梏，我，用什麽方法洒脱它們呢？</p>
<p>低下去，低下去我那梳得光光的頭，一支鋼箭似的東西，彷彿恰巧穿進於我的胸膛微微作痛。</p>

<h3>克勞黛考爾白的和一個奇特的影迷的通訊（下）</h3>
<p>— 緹雲</p>
<p>過了多日，那影迷又來了一封信，裏面除了上下欵外，别無他言，祗有一個小點。</p>
<p>克勞黛接到了那封信，不覺失聲笑了起來。寫信越來越簡單，竟簡單到這樣。於是她又異想天開起來，想寫封信給他，索性連一個小點都没有。她於是寫了一封信，祇具了上下欵，當中空白着，下面話了一行小字，寫的是：「你自己以爲聰明得很，請你自己去塡進去吧」！果然，過了幾天，一封厚厚的回信來了。裏面那影迷自己的信上說的是：「謹遵台命，將你的信的空處塡上了，但不知你敢寄不敢寄」？</p>
<p>克勞黛考爾白聽到這裏，又哈哈笑了起來道：「你看他替我寫的信，多大的膽子」！她說着，就將那位但尼爾葛克先生替她寫的信，交給了那新聞記者。他接過來一看，裏面寫的是：「親愛的葛克先生：我談了你的許多信，覺得你的人，不會討厭到那裏去的。你何不到落杉磯來玩玩呢？我們大大可以歡聚一下。並且拿我們的通訊作個標準，我相信我們團聚之後，一定是要談得舌敝唇焦，都没有止境的。你來吧。我一顆芳心，爲你歡躍着，靜待你的賁臨呢」！上面還替她署上了一個：「你的摯愛的克勞黛考爾白」。</p>
<p>克勞黛考爾白自從接到了那封信，知道這玩笑開得太大了。怎樣應付下去呢？如果她眞的將那信寄了去，那影迷當眞的跑到好萊塢來看她，那豈不是更使她爲難了嗎。但是要使她不寄那封信，又顯得她是個半吊子，不够幽默的味兒。</p>
<p>她委實遲疑不决起來。她將那信放在自己皮夾子裏，從家裏帶到攝影塲，又從攝影塲帶到家裏。如是者有　個禮拜之久，那信還没有寄出去。有一天，她忽然自己喊着自己的名字道：「克勞黛考爾白，你眞是個儍子」！她就拿定了主意，就那封信寄了出去。但是她在信後面，又加註了一行字，寫的是：「我信是敢寄的，但是你不要亦敢來起來。」</p>
<p>信去之後，大的有三個禮拜之久，有一天克勞黛在公司裏，一個公司裏的信差，遞給了她一封信。她一看，正是那位影迷寫來的。她那時候，正在化妝室裏用午膳。她隨即打開信來一看，裏面寫的是：「親愛的考爾白小姐：對不起得很，没有來陪你吃中飯。公司裏的職員，似乎不相信我的話：那裏來的這樣一位但尼爾葛克先生，會老遠的從烏克拉霍麥州跑到這裏來見這一面呢，因此，我留了這封信，請你今晚在大使館飯店吃晚飯吧」。下面署着：「你的大膽的但尼爾」。</p>
<p>克勞黛好像觸了電似的，動彈不得了。這個傢伙，眞的來了！怎麽辦呢？不知道他是怎麽樣的人。是的呢？老的呢？年輕的呢？她問着那公司裏的信差，看見那人没有？他摇着頭說没有。克勞黛於是請了一位朋友來，告訴了他一切國難的情形，請他先到飯店裏去看一看。</p>
<p>那人去了半天回來了。他微笑着道：「葛克先生眞是一個英俊男子，是是從來没有看見過的。他有六尺多高，身材甚爲魁梧。皮膚略帶，黝黑色。年紀大約三十左右」。克勞黛聽了，芳心怒放，恨不得立即跑過去吻他一下，但是她爲矜持起見，寫了一封信，謝了他的請柬，請他在一個禮拜五的晚上，到她家中來一叙。</p>
<p>禮拜五到了。七點半亦到了。跟着但尼爾葛克先生亦到了。克勞黛正在梳頭，她的閽人拿了一張名片進來，說葛克先生已到。克勞黛說：「請他等一等，我立即下來」。那閽人遲疑了一回，然後囁嚅着道：「葛克先生是一個女子」。克勞黛聽了莫名其妙。等到她親自下去一看，會客室裏祇有一位老太太。她看見了克勞黛就搶上一步，和她握着手。她的頭髮，白姑娘。面上除了些小縐紋之外，皮色紅嫩得和小孩子的一樣。她的眼睛，可以當得起「剪水雙瞳」四個字的雅號，眞是活動可愛極了。她開口說道：「讓我來介紹我自己吧。我是露茜彭勃羅克夫人，我就是和你通信的人。但尼爾葛克不過是我的筆名……」</p>
<p>克勞黛叙述到這個地方，又奔了出去。一回兒，她拿了一張大幅的照相來。她說道：「你看看。這就是葛克先生，再有趣没有的人了。我遇見失意的時候，祇要看見了她的照相，就憤怒全銷了」！（完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「國際大秘密」</h3>
<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>British　Agent　丨大光明</p>
<p>自中俄復交之後，我們得有機會鑒賞不少蘇聯影片。自美俄恢復通常關係之後，我們又有機會看到美國製片者採取蘇聯革命的故事製成的影片了。</p>
<p>現在的蘇聯，已不再被人視爲洪水猛獸了，最近它又加入了國聯，巍臨着日内瓦重要的局面。所以，如此作品之産生，在營業上也不是没有保障的，當全世界人民都在注意着這新的國家的時候。因此R.H.Bruce　Lookhart的原著便在好萊塢的攝影塲上被表現出來了。</p>
<p>是的，這裏是若干的表現了克倫斯基政府崩潰以後的所謂革命的故事，在列寗所領導的政權之下，怎樣和德國單獨媾和，怎樣打擊歐美各國對於革命的干涉。但是這在美國電影作家的表現之下，乃是不能不變質的，在眞實的史乘中出入不少主觀的僞造。顯然的，劇作者强調着反對蘇維埃政府單獨停戰，以爲損傷了恊約國的聯合戰綫，而有意忽視當時全國大衆，在飢餓死亡綫下對於和平之熱烈的要求。（這些在普多敷金的「聖比得堡之最後」或其他蘇聯影片中，都是表現得很充分的，）同樣，對於干涉革命的實質，也是在反對講和的口實之下掩飾着的，正面的表現十分微薄，雖然這裏也有着在跳舞會中國際干涉之隂謀的暴露。更主要的將革命黨的女偵探和英國的外交代表的羅曼斯，非常有興趣的誇張起來，在全部膠片中，所謂革命與戀愛的糾紛，佔了很重要的部份，最後是貴族出身的革命女子隨着愛人回到所謂美麗温柔的英國去。愛情戰勝了革命，這一Ｅnding正表現了劇作者觀念的庸俗。</p>
<p>從任何方面來說，這裏始終是美國電影作家所能理解的蘇聯革命故事。假使我們從蘇聯影片中所得來的印象，在此比較一下，很明顯的可以看到在相同的題材之下，完全有着不同的作風。劇作者的觀念旣如上述，更在表現技巧上來對照的窺探。</p>
<p>在蘇聯片中，通常可以看到的是沉毅，剛果，勇敢率直的民族性，這些，蘇聯作家是以重厚的氛圍，弛緩的調子表現出來的。然而在這「國際大秘密」中所表現的乃是十足的美國情調。在國防紳士一方面，如主人公施丹的風度，如美國的少爺軍官，固然不必說，而在女主人公革命女子身上，也同樣不是俄國味兒的女姓。總之，俄國固有的生活，習慣，感情，在這裏是没有若干把握的。我們所感覺到的，這始終是美國作家所表現的俄國的思想，山水，人物，不曾給與我們眞實的重厚的俄國味兒。可喜的是對於幾個當時的領袖人物，如列寗，如斯達林，如克倫斯基，由於演員們的化裝，都與我們在照片中所看到的相像，特别是列寗的風度，在葉靈鳳譯的某一小說中，我們曾經續過那樣的描寫。這一種回味頗能使人們感覺興趣。此外没有别的必需說及的了。</p>

<h3>「抵抗」今日公映</h3>
<p>「抵抗」是一部描寫歐洲大戰的影片。這片除了和以前所見到的幾部偉大戰事影片同樣給與我們驚心動魄的刺激以外，牠在逼眞的戰事描寫中很巧妙地藴藏着極深刻的意義和極趣味的劇情。因此這片是不能和其他的戰事影片同日而語的。</p>
<p>從含義方面而言，「抵抗」着重在暗示人們怎樣準備國防，以應付或有的外患。在此列强正在積極準備二次世界大戰之時，尤其是在今日的中國現狀之下，這一類用意在提醒我們，激發我們的民族主義的影片，是有牠的特殊的地位和時代的價值而爲我們所不能忽視的。</p>
<p>再從劇情方面而言，這片始述德軍怎樣於平靜無事的時候狙擊英法聯軍。繼言英法聯軍怎樣訓練槍手以應付德軍的狙擊。最後則以聯軍中兩個俄國槍手的下塲做結束。故事的演進，處處引人入勝。是亦戰事影片中之特色。</p>
<p>片中有中英文字幕，可謂外國片之别開生面。聞是片今日在卡爾登開映云。</p>

<h3>相逢待嫁（Forsaking　all　Others）（七）</h3>
<p>— 素因</p>
<p>康妮突然出現之後，傑弗雷亦突然出現了。傑弗雷知道康妮是有計劃的，要想拿圈套給曼麗戴的，他於是時時加以提防，跟住了康妮。但是康妮和曼麗兩個人，都不知道。等到曼麗知道的時候，她已經和傑弗雷坐在汽車裏了。康妮的計劃，亦就此没有能實行。</p>
<p>可是曼麗終究是愛迭倫的。自從他們久别重逢之後，她心中的愛苗，又突然茁生了。她想偶然的見見面，偶然的談談話，以及難得的在星期日，一同開着汽車到鄉下去玩玩，是不妨事的。她喜歡看看他的笑容，因爲他到底是個美男子，她早已心許了也。傑弗雷後來知道了，他曾苦苦地勸過她，可是她將他的話，當作耳邊風，絲毫没有發生什麽效力。她有一天在急不過的時候，就說道：「難道我是個不知廉恥的人，犯法的人，不能和一個男子見面的嗎？」傑弗雷亦說道：「迭倫是兩樣的！他曾經叫你一個人站在神壇前面結婚的。况且你已經深深愛了他，你會不顧一切的。你這是自己害自己。」曼麗道：「好了，好了。我就害我自己！你不用管我又不要造什麽貞節牌坊。」果然傑弗雷亦就從此不管了。</p>
<p>有一天，她和迭倫兩個人，又坐了車子到鄉下去玩了。他們走了無窮無盡的路，要想到葆拉的家裏去。曼麗說：「那是鄉間的一所空房子。」迭倫道：「我們去到那裏，就不空了。」曼麗看着迭倫的臉，要想知道他到底是什麽用意。迭倫笑了一笑，回答了一聲：「我愛你。」就低下頭去嚮着她。曼麗不覺芳心蕩漾，將兩隻手勾住了迭倫的頸𩓐子。就在這一霎那間，出了岔子了。汽車掉在路旁溝裏了！</p>
<p>他們没有法子，祇可以離開了汽車，在灰沙道上走着。他們走了無數里路，走得大家一身臭汗，亦無羅曼斯可言了。最後，他們走到了一個汽油站，但是那裏没有修理汽車的人。幸虧那裏有一個少年，用車子送了他們一段，送到離葆拉家，最近的一個人家，叫他們先去取空屋子的鑰匙。他們取了鑰匙，於是再開步走。可是天公又不作美，下起一陣大雨起來。因此，等到他們到目的地的時候，兩個人的身上，已經浸透了。</p>
<p>他們進了屋子，四面翻尋着舊衣服。可是他們祗尋到些葆拉的襯衣，因此迭倫亦祇可以將自己的衣服褪了下來，穿上了女人的襯衣了。下午變成了黄昏。黄昏變成了晚上。他們起初在汽油站的時候，曼麗本來叫迭倫去打電話，呌他的侍者莊生拿汽車來接的。可是迭倫故意的没有打電話。到了現在，迭倫自己亦後悔起來了。因爲這所空屋子裏，一些吃的東西都没有。他們尋到了一聽沙丁魚，可是等到罐頭開好，一不小心，掉在地下，給猫吃掉了。</p>
<p>他們於無法可想，無事可爲之中，祗可以點起一盞煤油燈，在壁爐裏生了一個火取取煖。過了一回，迭倫忽然想到一個奇妙的取暖方法。他突然將曼麗摟了過來吻着，嘴裏說着：「我愛你愛得不得了了……」曼麗將他推開了，指着鋼琴上一個東西說道：「你看。那是什麽？」迭倫一看，不覺心頭火起，原來是一隻猫，剛才吃沙丁魚的猫，很乖覺地坐在鋼琴上看着他們。迭倫抓起一個枕墊來，喊了一聲：「滾你媽的！」就颼的擲了過去。曼麗連忙喊住他，巳經來不及了。又闖了　禍了。（未完）</p>

<p>Huang Fu Paid a Visit for a Long Conversation</p>
<p>The Entire Military Sub-Committee Hosted a Banquet</p>
<p>Huang Jinjing to Take Over Zhengwei Matters, Wang Kemin to Act as Representative</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin arrived in Beiping at approximately 7 AM this morning. Party and government agencies had prepared a grand welcome in advance. Approximately 600-700 welcomers were present at the station. After alighting from the train, He proceeded to the Jurentang for rest. He was accompanied by his wife, son, and secretaries Xie Zhongyuan and Zeng Wancang. At approximately 9 AM, all members of the Military Sub-Committee paid their respects and He gave a speech. At approximately 10 AM, Huang Fu and his wife paid a visit and Huang and He began a lengthy conversation that continued until noon. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin went to Zhengwei at 3 pm this afternoon to return the visit. They talked for one hour. Afterwards, he returned to Jurentang for rest. Due to the long journey, He has scheduled appointments with visiting guests. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) All members of the Military Sub-Committee will host a banquet for He tonight. Yu Xuezhong rushed to attend. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Due to He Yingqin's return to Beiping, Yu Xuezhong took a car to Beiping this afternoon to pay his respects. The Military Sub-Committee regular meeting will be convened next Monday, and Yu will attend before returning to Tianjin. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Xuezhong came to Beiping this afternoon to visit He and reported on the recent military and political situation in Hebei Province. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This morning, Huang Fu sent someone to return a visit to Panchen Lama's younger brother, Cejuelin. The conversation lasted for half an hour before they left. Cejuelin is scheduled to continue touring the Forbidden City on the 18th. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin issued a written statement saying, "Last year, due to my long absence from Beijing, there were matters in the Ministry of Military Administration that needed attention. I went to Beijing in October and took the opportunity to attend my mother-in-law's funeral in Shanghai. Then, due to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee, I stayed in Beijing to attend. I have been living in Beijing for nearly three months. Recently, the affairs of the Ministry have been largely settled, and I left Beijing on the 9th of this month and went north, detouring to Hebian Village to offer sacrifices to the late Yan Fengweng on behalf of Chiang. The funeral of the late Yan Fengweng was completed on the 14th. I left Bing yesterday afternoon and returned to Beiping. Shanxi Province is working hard on production and construction. The Tongpu Railway, which was built by the Shanxi Provincial Ordnance Factory, has been opened to traffic to Xinzhou in the north and to Huoxian in the south. It will be fully opened to traffic next year. After the Red bandits in Jiangxi were defeated in their old nest in Ruijin, they fled west one after another. Although they were intercepted by government troops along the way, a part of them still took the opportunity to flee into Guizhou Province, attempting to contact the Red bandits in Sichuan. The central government now has an overall plan for suppressing the bandits in Sichuan and Guizhou, with the aim of completely eliminating them in the shortest possible time. Because the affairs of the Ministry of Military Administration and the Beiping Military Sub-Committee are very important, I may travel between Beiping and Beijing from time to time in the future in order to handle all important public affairs. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Huang Fu is about to go to Beijing, and the Railway Bureau has prepared two special cars, which have been parked at the platform. Huang's bamboo suitcases and gifts, more than 70 pieces, have been transported to the East Station this morning to be loaded onto the train. It is said that Huang will get off the train in Tianjin to meet with foreign guests. After Huang goes to Beijing, the affairs of the Zhengwei will be handled by committee member Wang Kemin. Huang will stay in Beijing and Shanghai for about a month before returning north. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Chiang Orders All Troops to Prohibit Disturbing the People</h3>
<p>(Hankou) Chairman Chiang issued an order to all troops, strictly prohibiting all troops from disturbing the people, or arbitrarily searching on the pretext of bandit areas. The marching and supply of each bandit suppression force should be carried with them and may not be searched from the people. Not disturbing the people is an effective way to eliminate local communists. (17th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Ma Yinchu Discusses China's Economic Crisis</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Yinchu said that China's industry is now mostly concentrated in Shanghai, one because of convenient transportation, two because of sufficient fuel, and three because of convenient exports. In fact, it is very dangerous. The more convenient Shanghai is, the more inconvenient the interior is. Once an international danger occurs, Shanghai will bear the brunt. At that time, it will be impossible to move to the interior. In my personal opinion, although it is impossible to make Shanghai factories leave the convenient area and move to inconvenient places now, it is not impossible to divide its strength and develop evenly in Nanjing, Hankou, Jiujiang, Wuhu, Wuxi, Ningbo, Hangzhou, etc., in order to build inland industry. I hope the industrial community will pay attention. China's silver is completely concentrated in Shanghai, which is extremely dangerous. Not only does it affect the development of the entire rural economy in peacetime, but once international changes occur, foreigners' cash in Shanghai can still be transported to Hong Kong, while China's cash in Shanghai cannot be transported abroad or inland. Then, the 2.1 billion yuan of deposits that the people of the country have stored in banks and the 400 million yuan of banknotes issued by banks will all be reduced to nothing. For the sake of preparing for a rainy day, the only way is to fully invest in rural areas to make China's silver completely distributed in the interior, so that it can be prepared for contingencies and rest easy. In summary, the danger of China's economy today lies here. It cannot be saved without the people's self-determination and self-awareness. (17th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zhang Naiyan Discusses the International Situation in Europe</h3>
<p>Denies Resignation as Envoy</p>
<p>(Nanjing) A reporter visited Zhang Naiyan on the evening of the 17th and asked about the international situation in Europe after the Saar returned to Germany. Zhang said that there are many fuses for the international crisis in Europe. The Saar issue is only one of them. Even if the Saar returns to its old master, it will only be a local easing between France and Germany. The world crisis can be expected to pass safely this year, but in Europe, special events may occur at any time, causing the possibility of war. As for the major powers such as Britain and France, they have a sense of being out of reach on the Far East issue. Even if they want to intervene, it is only for their own interests. Our country is in this crisis, and the only way is to unite to deal with it. I have taken a three-month leave to return to China to report on the diplomatic situation in China and Belgium and to inspect the construction projects in Europe. The leave will expire next month and I will return to my post. The news that I resigned yesterday is not true. (17th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Saarland Designated as a Demilitarized Zone, Germany Accepts in Principle</h3>
<p>Counter-Proposal Submitted for Removal of Military Engineering</p>
<p>Agreement Reached on March 1st as the Return Date</p>
<p>Technical Issues Still to be Negotiated Between France and Germany</p>
<p>(Geneva) France's demand that the Saarland should be included in the demilitarized zone of the Rhineland under the Treaty of Versailles has been accepted by Germany in principle. This acceptance is contained in Germany's reply today to the draft plan of the League of Nations for the return of the Saarland. However, Germany's recent actions have not eliminated the stalemate caused by France's demand, as Germany has put forward a counter-proposal regarding the demolition of railways, barracks, and other engineering works with implicit military value in the Saarland. Another point requiring further negotiation is Germany's opposition to the proposal that if Germany and France cannot reach an agreement on technical issues by March 1st, the Council of the League of Nations should act as arbitrator. March 1st is the currently proposed date for the return of the Saarland. Consul-General Krull of Germany in Geneva discussed Germany's counter-proposal with the Committee of Three today and then telegraphed new suggestions to Berlin. The German authorities now regard France's last-minute interpretation of the demilitarization of the Saarland as the biggest obstacle to Germany's acceptance of the Geneva proposals. According to political circles in Berlin, Germany will not accept any solution that would result in the Saarland being treated differently from other demilitarized zones. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is now known that Germany has agreed in principle to designate the Saarland as a demilitarized zone, and that Germany and France have agreed on March 1st as the date for Germany to regain sovereignty over the Saarland. Germany's reply was submitted to the French government this morning, stating that since the Treaty of Versailles has already decided the issue of the disarmament of the Saarland, there is no need to discuss the matter further. Therefore, Germany has tacitly acknowledged the Saarland as a demilitarized zone. If the French government accepts this interpretation by Germany, the Council of the League of Nations will pass a resolution on the return of the Saarland to Germany at its meeting this afternoon. (National Telegram, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Saarland Committee today resolved to recommend to the Council of the League of Nations that the Saarland be returned to Germany on March 1st. However, according to reliable sources, France may demand that after the return, the Brown Shirts and Stormtroopers should still be prohibited from entering the Saarland. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The meeting of the Council of the League of Nations, originally scheduled for 4 pm today, has now been postponed by half an hour. It is generally believed that this is a good sign and that the Saarland issue still has a chance of being resolved this month. The Chairman of the Committee of Three, Aloisi, is continuing to exchange views with the German Consul-General in Geneva, Krull, in the hope of reaching a definitive solution. German sources say that they are willing to reach an agreement, but believe that being too hasty will harm important interests. The German government has no objection to the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles being implemented in the Saarland region, but has raised some reservations, the most important of which are the removal of military railways and the demolition of existing fortifications. The President of the Council, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü, hosted a luncheon for the representatives of the Council countries at noon today for a social gathering. After the banquet, French Foreign Minister Laval met with British Lord Privy Seal Eden and Italian representative Aloisi. (Havas, 17th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Germany can take over the Saarland on March 1st if issues such as disarmament can be resolved first. France cited the Treaty of Versailles, demanding that all German territory on the left bank of the Rhine be demilitarized, which caused the Council of the League of Nations meeting this afternoon to fail to formally announce the return of the Saarland to Germany. European political circles were quite surprised and feared that it would cause resentment in Germany and create unnecessary complications. A compromise was drafted in the evening under the supervision of the Aloisi Committee, and people's hearts began to settle down. The solution is that before the formal return, France and Germany should negotiate existing issues, the most important of which is the demilitarization of the Saarland. If the two countries cannot reach an agreement within a week of the end of February, a special meeting of the Council of the League of Nations should be convened to resolve the dispute between the two countries. It is expected that Germany will accept this solution, and it is hoped that the Council of the League of Nations can meet tomorrow to discuss the Saarland plebiscite. It is heard that Germany has accepted in principle the extension of the demilitarized zone to the Saarland, but has not yet agreed to France's proposal to demolish certain transportation facilities related to military use. It is also heard that the Franco-German expert committee has decided to request the Council of the League of Nations to advocate the return of the Saarland to Germany between February 15th and March 1st. The Council of the League of Nations meeting this afternoon was originally intended to formally announce the return of the Saarland to Germany, but was postponed due to France's proposal for the demilitarization of the Saarland. France claimed that, according to Articles 42 to 44 of the Treaty of Versailles, no armaments or troops may be stationed on the German territory on the left bank of the Rhine, and all military railways, transportation equipment for troops and trains, and bridges and canals with military value must be demolished. The German government asked the Aloisi Committee to apply to the Council of the League of Nations to determine the date of the return of the Saarland. The French government opposed the immediate return, fearing that Germany would delay the solution of the important issue of the demilitarization of the Saarland until after the return, in which case any intervention by the League of Nations would be futile. (Reuters, 16th)</p>
<h3>Committee of Three Redrafts Report</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After convening a meeting for one hour this afternoon, Mr. Aloisi, Chairman of the Saarland Committee of Three, made a statement that the Committee of Three had redrafted the report to be submitted to the Council of the League of Nations. The Committee's recommendations are still based on the results of the Saarland plebiscite. The contents of the newly drafted report are not detailed, but it is known that a draft has been sent to the German Consul in Geneva for him to submit to Berlin for review by the German government. Germany will issue a statement on the report of the Committee of Three on Thursday. The Council of the League of Nations is scheduled to convene a meeting at 4 pm on Thursday, and the German government's statement will be sent to Geneva before the meeting.

<h3>Customs Posts Established on the Franco-Saarland Border</h3>
<p>Saarbrücken According to reliable sources, the French customs authorities have announced that from January 16th, a customs post should be established on the border between France and the Saarland, because according to the Treaty of Paris, the Saarland has had no customs border with France for the past fifteen years. The Saarland Mining Bureau, managed by the French, has also announced that all its staff will be dismissed at the end of February, with appropriate subsidies. After this is implemented, 1,100 French staff will be affected and will have to return to France with their families. Furthermore, the French mining bureau will also move to Metz in the near future, where suitable houses have already been rented. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>French Forbach The customs union between France and the Saarland has effectively been abolished. The French customs office, which was previously located on the border between the Saarland and Germany, has now been moved to the border between Lorraine and the Saarland.

<h3>An Atmosphere of Revenge is Everywhere</h3>
<p>(Paris) The special correspondents of major French newspapers stationed in Saarbrücken all say that everything in Saarbrücken is already like a German city. Anti-National Socialist Party figures have begun to withdraw from the Saarland region. "Le Matin" said, "The whole city is like it has been liberated, like the day after a holiday." "Le Journal" expressed pleasure at the peaceful order in Saarbrücken, but said, "The current situation is not yet reliable, as an atmosphere of revenge is still everywhere. Those who are strong in the German front line still want to punish those they call 'traitors' and will not give up. When Germany formally recovers the Saarland region in the future, it will inevitably carry out political retaliation. Therefore, most people, thinking of this, cannot help but feel terrified and believe that now is still a time to hide and should not miss the opportunity." Le Petit Parisien said, "The withdrawal of anti-National Socialist Party figures from the Saarland is only the beginning, but the scene in front of the French consulate is already too horrible to look at. Families who have been displaced, supporting the old and carrying the young, live in front of the consulate gate. Men and women sit on luggage baskets, and are afraid of being spied on by secret agents. They deliberately avoid showing their identity cards when they present them, and when someone takes a film, they often turn their heads to avoid being filmed." L'Echo de Paris also said that anti-National Socialist Party figures are now suffering from real fear. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Political Exiles Flee to France</h3>
<p>(Paris) Three Marxists from the Saarland, Mr. Braun, Mr. Woerther, and Mr. Haffmen, who were in favor of maintaining the status quo in the Saarland, fled to France today. According to Mr. Braun, he has no intention of returning to the Saarland. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>French Sarreguemines Residents of the Saarland who voted against returning the Saarland to Germany, fearing that they would not be able to protect themselves under Hitler's rule, have begun to migrate. Hundreds of people have arrived here today, and another 2,000 people will cross the border into France tomorrow. The police are now strictly checking the passports of those arriving here from the Saarland, and several people have been barred from entering the country because their passports did not meet the regulations.

<p>Saarbrücken The Saarland Administrative Committee has received information from the French side that last night in Uting, several Saarland women, believing that their environment had been threatened, temporarily took refuge in Simbach, France. Shortly afterwards, they returned to the Saarland, and on the way, five people in uniform fired at them, fortunately without hitting them. It was later found by the French gendarmerie that the bullet casings had fallen within French territory. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Hitler Attacks the Treaty of Versailles</h3>
<p>Contradictory Statements</p>
<p>(Paris) German leader Hitler made a statement to American reporters yesterday, saying, "Once France can grant Germany equal rights, I am prepared to give up demands regarding territorial issues on France." This statement was reprinted by Paris Midi today and commented on by the newspaper's reporter, Schner, who said, "Hitler is using the Saarland plebiscite as a starting point to attack the Treaty of Versailles." After the results of Tuesday's plebiscite were announced, Hitler made a statement on the radio, saying that after the Saarland was returned to Germany, Germany would no longer make territorial demands on France. Now he has made contradictory statements to American reporters. His intentions are unpredictable. (Hannes, 17th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Troops Increase Border Defense</h3>
<p>Vienna The Austrian government, fearing that the results of the Saarland vote would cause demonstrations, today sent new troops to Linz in Upper Austria to strengthen the defenses on the border between Austria and Bavaria. At the same time, according to Reuters Berlin, the general manager of a steel factory in Zile, Saxony, Mr. Gort Beck, has been placed under protective custody at the request of the local National Socialist Party leader for not allowing his workers to listen to Hitler's speech during the Saarland vote. The factory has a total of 10,000 workers. (Reuters, 17th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Should Impose Arms Embargo on Paraguay</h3>
<p>Subcommittee Submits Recommendation</p>
<p>Paraguay Threatens to Withdraw from the League</p>
<p>(Geneva) Regarding the Chaco dispute, the Advisory Committee of the League of Nations has received the report of the Subcommittee to impose sanctions on Paraguay, but Bolivia is not sanctioned because it has accepted the recommendations of the Special Assembly. Hu Shih-tse, the Chinese representative on the Chaco Committee, has advocated this approach from the beginning. (Central News Agency, 16th)</p>
<p>Asunción According to sources close to the government, if the League of Nations accepts the construction of the Advisory Committee and implements an arms embargo that favors Bolivia, Paraguay will withdraw from the League of Nations. According to the government's opinion, Bolivia is the head of the Chaco War, and any arms embargo that favors Bolivia violates the spirit and provisions of the League Covenant. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The dispute between Bolivia and Paraguay in South America over the Chaco territory has been pending for a long time. The League of Nations previously resolved to prohibit the shipment of arms to these two countries, and the United States also joined the embargo. The Advisory Committee of the Chaco Incident of the League of Nations has now submitted a report to the Advisory Committee, advocating that the ban on the transportation of arms to Bolivia be lifted, but Paraguay should still be embargoed for rejecting the recommendations passed by the League of Nations General Assembly last November to show sanctions. The United States is unlikely to consider this proposal, because the majority party leaders in Congress are not prepared for this. Senator Johnson and other senators who oppose the United States joining the League of Nations previously supported participating in the League of Nations' resolution to ban arms shipments because this ban applied to both belligerent countries. Now they declare that they do not want to allow this ban to be changed. The State Department may not take any action on this matter. Some informed sources believe that Bolivia bought arms from the United States during the implementation of the arms embargo, and was still able to buy them as usual after the implementation. The Ministry of Justice said that it has no power to force the people to respect this ban. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<h3>Marseille Case, South Tyrol Dispute Included in Next Agenda</h3>
<p>Italian-Albanian Dispute, the Two Countries Conduct Negotiations</p>
<p>(Geneva) Hungary has submitted a memorandum on the dispute between South Tyrol and Hungary over the Marseille assassination, stating the results of the investigation into the issue of responsibility for the case. Because the memorandum is too long, this session of the Council of the League of Nations has not been able to discuss it and will be handed over to the next session of the Council. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Albanian representative today applied to include the Italian-Albanian dispute over Ulzur in the agenda of this session of the Council of the League of Nations, but many believe that the representatives of the two countries in dispute are now conducting informal talks, the result of which may resolve the dispute without the League of Nations' intervention.

According to Polish sources, French Foreign Minister Laval visited Polish Foreign Minister Beck and discussed various international issues and suggestions. According to reliable sources, the Polish Foreign Minister has agreed to participate in the Non-Intervention Pact proposed by Italy and France, but Poland still believes that there is no need to join the Eastern European Pact. The Polish Foreign Minister also met with Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov and Spanish representative Madariaga, and French Foreign Minister Laval also met with Soviet Russian Foreign Affairs Commissioner Litvinov. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French government's response to Germany's memorandum of September 10th last year on the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact will not be published, but it is generally believed that today's meeting between Polish Foreign Minister Beck and French Foreign Minister Laval has brought the negotiations on the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact into a vigorous new stage. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>Vienna The Franco-Italian Non-Intervention Agreement has now been formally submitted to the Austrian government.

<p>Navy Aims to Complete Treaty Permitted Limits</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson declared today that the United States government has no other plans to immediately build new ships or renovate warships other than to complete the limits allowed by the treaty. Therefore, if a naval competition occurs internationally, the initiator must be another country, not the United States. Mr. Smith also said that he still advocates maintaining the current naval ratio. Secretary of War Germany declared that there is no need to dig a canal in Nicaragua, because the Panama Canal is sufficient to meet all needs. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>

<h3>London Prepares to Hold a Chinese Art Exhibition</h3>
<p>Treasures from the Forbidden City Will Be Shipped for Display</p>
<p>Chairman Lin and the King of England Serve as Honorary Presidents</p>
<p>(London) A large-scale Chinese art exhibition will be held in London from November 18th of this year to March 1936. After the Royal Academy of Fine Arts in the United Kingdom contacted the Chinese authorities, it plans to ship many of the antiquities from the Palace Museum in Peiping, which have not been seen by Europeans, to London for display. The exhibition will be co-hosted by the Chinese and British governments. The Chairman of the Chinese National Government, the King and Queen of England are all honorary presidents of the exhibition. Chinese cultural and artistic items from ancient times to 1800 years ago will be displayed separately. The Chinese government has allowed experts from the Chinese and British governments to jointly select antiquities from the Peiping Ancient Palace, including calligraphy, painting, ceramics, bronzes, jade, textiles, lacquerware, etc. In addition, collectors from Europe and the United States are invited to exhibit their rare treasures. Recent archaeological discoveries will also be displayed throughout the venue. It is generally hoped that this Chinese art exhibition, from an artistic point of view, can at least match previous international exhibitions, and Europe's understanding of Eastern art, especially Chinese art, will open a new era. (Havas, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) Four members of the organizing committee of the Chinese Art Exhibition will go to China, Japan, and the Americas this spring to discuss exhibition matters. (Havas, 17th)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Reflections on the Saar Plebiscite 　　Heng</h3>
<p>The issue of the Saar's allegiance has been resolved due to the results of the 13th's plebiscite. The transfer of power and the establishment of a non-war zone afterward are minor details, not substantial issues, and not worth discussing. What I wish to say now is my own feelings.</p>
<p>The Saar is one of Europe's important coal regions. Its reserves, based on an annual output of 10 million tons, can be mined for 600 years without depletion. Moreover, before the Great War, the Germans used this coal to smelt the iron of Lorraine, so economically and technologically, it was almost inseparable from Lorraine. After the war, Lorraine was returned to France, so its desire to occupy the Saar was a matter of course. However, with the results of this plebiscite, the French authorities have been very open-minded about it, and do not want to raise any objections. This spirit of valuing promises, justice, and loving peace is truly worthy of our admiration. I believe that there are many causes of international hatred, but the forceful occupation of other people's land and the enslavement of other nations are the greatest causes. If all the countries in the world could deeply regret their territorial ambitions and respect the personality of others, then the precariousness and unease in international relations could be reduced by ninety percent. Without talking about peace, peace will come naturally. This is what I hope those who truly love peace will pay attention to.</p>
<p>Before the Saar plebiscite, those familiar with the international situation mostly predicted that a majority would return to Germany. However, the number of votes for returning to Germany was actually over 90 percent, which was quite unexpected. The reason is that since the German National Socialist Party revolution, the status quo faction has been quite active for a time due to the instigation and encouragement of various exiles. Because of this, outsiders did not dare to make a hasty judgment. Now, looking at the results of this plebiscite, we can see that what the people of the Saar want is national restoration. If they can restore their country, they can disregard all personal interests. This Germanic spirit, which prioritizes national interests, is truly worthy of being a model for our nation. Those status quo factions who only fight for the interests of their parties and individuals, and seek temporary comfort, deserve to be spurned by the people of the Saar.</p>
<p>The League of Nations governed the Saar for fifteen years, and there were many restrictions on the residents. However, the result was still a return to Germany. From this, we can see that anyone who uses force to invade other people's land will ultimately fail. This is a fact with many examples throughout history, both in China and abroad. The five barbarian tribes of the Jin Dynasty, the Liao, Jin, and Yuan dynasties after the Song Dynasty, and the Qing Dynasty after the Ming Dynasty, all had great momentum when they invaded our country. But in the end, they were all assimilated by us and could not harm us in the slightest. This is one example. Furthermore, evidence from modern European history also shows that this is always the case. Those who invade others inevitably fail, and those who are invaded, or even enslaved, have the possibility of national restoration, regardless of how long it takes. For example, the countries in the Balkan Peninsula were ruled by Turkey for hundreds of years, but in the nineteenth century, they successively became independent and autonomous. The same is true of Poland and the countries of the Little Entente. From this, we can see that as long as the national spirit exists, there will eventually be a day of revival. Those who like to invade others by force and enslave others only increase the animosity and hatred between nations and make world wars cycle endlessly.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, the spirit of our people has been extremely depressed. Everyone believes that the recovery of lost territory is an impossible fact. However, looking at the results of this Saar plebiscite, we can see that if the national spirit does not die, then lost territory can eventually be returned to the motherland. Therefore, what our country needs today is not pessimistic resignation, but vigorous self-improvement. We must first exhaust our intelligence and do our best to strengthen unity within the country and prioritize the interests of the nation, without being petty about personal interests. Then everything is possible, let alone the recovery of a small amount of lost territory. What is needed is whether the people of our country have a thorough awakening.</p>

<h3>Roosevelt's Message to the Senate Urges Joining the World Court</h3>
<p>Expresses Support for Peace While Not Harming U.S. Sovereignty</p>
<p>Asks Congress to Abandon Partisan Prejudices and Consider the Matter</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Johnson today launched a major attack in the Senate on the issue of the United States joining the World Court. At the same time, President Roosevelt's message was read out, and Johnson immediately declared that he would do everything possible to keep all U.S. actions free and independent. He believes that the United States is being invited to participate in various disputes under the League of Nations system. As for President Roosevelt's message, it urges Congress to abandon partisan prejudices and consider the matter. The President also said, "The movement to promote international justice should be non-partisan. I sincerely hope that the Senate will pass the bill to join the World Court as soon as possible to realize this prudent and pure American policy." The President also stated that after joining, there is no danger of the United States' autonomy being harmed. "Moreover, at this time, international relations can all affect the future world peace, and it is an excellent opportunity for the United States to express its support for peace." Observers here expect that since the President has strongly advocated for the bill, the government's Senate leaders will exert great pressure on the opposition. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Yesterday, President Roosevelt sent a message to the Senate recommending that the United States join the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague. Officials believe that the Senate will definitely pass it, because it was rumored beforehand that Roosevelt would not personally come forward on this matter. Now that the President has actually sent a message to the Senate, it shows that he is confident of success. Although some people in the United States are still strongly opposed to everything related to the International Court and the League of Nations, the fact that the Saar issue was resolved quickly and smoothly may be due to the League of Nations. American skeptics and opponents of the League of Nations have also been convinced by this. Recently, the Senate discussed the President's message. Senator Johnson, a Republican from California who usually supports the President but opposes joining the International Court, rose and said, "The International Court has nothing to do with the United States. If the United States joins, it will inevitably be drawn into the European vortex and will not be able to extricate itself." This is probably the biggest reason the opposition believes in. Fortunately, President Roosevelt had already anticipated this, and his message contained preemptive words, saying that successive Republican and Democratic governments in the United States had expressed approval of the International Court in principle. "This policy is very sound and consistent with the views of the American people. The sovereignty of the United States will in no way be weakened by this." (Havas Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Senate Inflationists Convene Monetary System Conference</h3>
<p>Negotiate a Specific Plan to Submit to Congress</p>
<p>Treasury Secretary Also Meets with the Attorney General</p>
<p>(Washington) The resolution passed by the National Monetary System Conference today has been submitted to Congress. The resolution advocates that the U.S. dollar should be detached from a fixed relationship with gold and abandon any similar gold standard situation in order to facilitate the U.S. response to foreign currency devaluation. The spokesperson of the conference also requested immediate minting of coins. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The National Monetary System Conference convened by Senator Thomas, the leader of the Senate inflationists, opened today. First, representatives of several national organizations spoke, urging immediate devaluation of the U.S. currency. After a brief debate, a resolution was passed requesting that the U.S. dollar be restored to its 1926 purchasing power as soon as possible, and that a "U.S. Central Bank" be established to replace the Federal Reserve System and expand its power to control national lending. There are also other plans as follows: (1) Immediately pay veteran bonuses in cash; (2) Restore silver as the monetary standard, with free minting at a ratio of sixteen to one between gold and silver; (3) Reduce the gold content of the U.S. dollar again. Thomas delivered the opening speech, expressing hope that the attendees, representing half of the American people, would be able to jointly negotiate a specific plan to submit to Congress. Father Coughlin said that if Congress does not want to cause a revolution, it must restore its constitutionally granted power to control domestic currency prices, and said, "What we have now is just bookkeeping money." He also advocated that all Federal Reserve Banks should be nationalized. In addition, former Senator Owen represented the hard currency faction, advocating that Congress has the power to recover the right to adjust currency prices from private individuals. Congressional silver advocates such as Wheeler and Borah Martin also attended the meeting, but did not express their opinions. Silver advocates said that Thomas is most concerned with reducing the value of gold and the dollar and fighting for silver as the standard. In addition, paper money inflation is not what he wants to hear. (National Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The proposal committee of the National Inflation Conference today proposed to the conference to issue new coins so that veteran bonuses can be paid in full, and proposed to establish a central bank to control the national currency. According to its proposal, Congress will take over the minting power, regulate the currency, and have the power to deal with emergencies. The proposal committee does not advocate: (1) Creating a sound and sufficient currency that is detached from gold so that the country can deal with foreign currency manipulation; (2) Placing the U.S. currency value in a position that can at least restore 1926 prices. Today, the temporary meeting between Treasury Secretary Morgenthau and Attorney General Cummings has aroused speculation that the authorities may have new financial measures. (Reuters Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Officialdom here firmly believes that the Supreme Court will uphold the abolition of gold clauses, but if the court rules unfavorably to the issue, the authorities will submit a legislative bill to legalize President Roosevelt's move to abolish gold clauses. President Roosevelt's attempt to raise prices by reducing the gold content of the U.S. dollar is an extremely important part of the President's program, and the success or failure of this move depends on the invalidation of the gold clauses in June 1933. Therefore, if the court makes a ruling unfavorable to the government, President Roosevelt will inevitably try to avoid the consequences arising therefrom, because he does not want his new measures to be in danger of being overturned. At a time when the people are eagerly awaiting the court's decision, the inflationists have gathered here to negotiate a plan to make the U.S. dollar even cheaper. Senator Thomas has convened representatives of various organizations that support inflation and members of Congress to meet. This meeting is called the National Inflation Conference. Thomas announced that the purpose of this meeting is to obtain a cheaper U.S. dollar in order to restore 1926 prices. Senator Wheeler stated that various currency plans will depend on the Supreme Court's decision on whether securities containing gold clauses must be paid with old U.S. dollars or with current U.S. dollars. Once the verdict is announced, the authorities will take practical steps to deal with it. No matter what the court does, there is nothing to worry about, because Congress can immediately legislate to deal with the situation arising therefrom. The general opinion in financial circles is that the activities of the inflationists are enough to confirm the speculation that President Roosevelt would rather disobey the Supreme Court than re-raise the price of the U.S. dollar. At the same time, trading in the New York stock market is currently quite quiet, because it wants to wait for the result of the gold clause case. (Reuters Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<h3>Roosevelt's Old-Age Pensions and Poverty Relief</h3>
<p>(Washington) The U.S. government today implemented two major relief measures for the issue of old-age pensions and poverty relief:</p>
<p>(1) Providing unemployed people with a weekly subsidy of $15;</p>
<p>(2) Providing elderly people with a monthly old-age pension of $15 to $60.</p>
<p>This bill has been submitted to the House of Representatives by Senator Wagner. (National Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<h3>France Ships Gold to the United States</h3>
<p>(Paris) France is now shipping gold to the United States again because it has received news from Washington that the U.S. authorities do not want to change the U.S. gold price. U.S. officials are confident that the Supreme Court will support the authorities in the gold clause case, but even if the court recognizes the abolition of gold clauses as illegal, the authorities will try to circumvent it. France and the United States both hold a kind of trust that President Roosevelt will try to overcome any legal obstacles encountered by his monetary policy. This situation can be seen in today's Reuters telegraph. (Reuters Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<p>(Paris) After receiving news from the U.S. Treasury Department that it does not want to lower the gold price, French bankers are now preparing to load more gold to go to the United States. The first batch will be loaded on the German ship Europa on Saturday and Sunday to cross the Atlantic. (Reuters Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<h3>Polish Senate Passes New Constitution Draft</h3>
<p>Abolishes the Name of the Republic</p>
<p>Cancels Proportional Representation</p>
<p>Warsaw The Polish Senate recently passed the new constitution draft with a majority of 74 votes to 24. One of the most important aspects of this new constitution is that the name "Polish Republic" is no longer in the constitution, only "Polish State." The proportional representation system has been completely abolished. As for the new election law, it is not included in the constitution and will be submitted and passed separately later. The general rights of citizens are still maintained in the new constitution, but some are restricted. In addition, what the opposition party members are particularly uneasy about is the autonomous system of Upper Silesia, because according to the new constitution, the autonomous system of Upper Silesia can be changed or completely abolished only after the State Council decides. After this new constitution draft is passed in the Senate, it will be submitted to the House of Representatives for discussion starting next week. The House of Representatives only needs a majority to pass the constitution draft. (Note: Upper Silesia originally belonged to Germany, and part of it was划归to Poland after the European War) (Havas Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<h3>Japan-Russia Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Sino-Eastern Railway issue, which has been under negotiation for two years since the start of negotiations, can be satisfactorily resolved after two or three more consultations. Foreign Minister Hirota is determined to take this opportunity to resolve various pending issues between Japan and Russia in order. After Ambassador Ota returns to Russia, he will immediately start negotiations with the Russian government on the revision of the Japan-Russia Fisheries Treaty, and negotiate the establishment of a committee to prevent border wars, the North Sakhalin oil rights issue, etc. (Japan United Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Moscow newspapers all carried the following Harbin news: A Harbin newspaper reported that the Soviet Deputy Consul in Harbin, Trepinsky, had a conversation with a "certain important person in Manchuria," falsely claiming that Trepinsky had said, "Whether the Sino-Eastern Railway issue can be resolved is doubtful, because the Soviet Union has not been eager to sell the railway recently," etc. The intention of this rumor is very obvious, that is, the Soviet Union does not want to sell the railway, so the Tokyo talks must be stopped, and at the same time, the railway must be forcibly seized by force. The Soviet Consulate General in Harbin issued a denial of this, pointing out that this is purely fabricated. However, the Manchurian semi-official news agency Guotongshe claimed that although the Consulate General denied it, "reliable sources" proved that Trepinsky's conversation was indeed true. The Soviet side made an oral protest to Guotongshe, and the "Manchukuo" Foreign Affairs Bureau replied that it had no say in Guotongshe, because the latter had extraterritorial rights and was under the jurisdiction of the Japanese. These Japanese are not subject to the control of the Manchurian authorities because they have consular jurisdiction. (Tass Telegraph, 16th)</p>
<h3>British Liberal Party Leader Announces Major Economic Recovery Plan</h3>
<p>Advocates British-American Cooperation to Guarantee World Peace</p>
<p>Actively Use Tariffs to Eliminate Trade Barriers</p>
<p>Organize Public Works to Absorb Domestic Unemployment</p>
<p>Declares It Is Purely for the Country and Does Not Want to Promote Doctrines</p>
<p>Former Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden Expresses Strong Support</p>
<p>(London) Liberal Party leader Lloyd George took the opportunity of his 72nd birthday today to address the public at a gathering in Bangor, announcing his major plan to relieve the British economic difficulties. Although George is old, his speech was as impassioned and fluent as ever, so he was able to attract the attention of thousands of listeners in attendance. It is estimated that no less than 5,000 people stood outside in the cold wind listening to his speech through loudspeakers. The number of people who came from all over Wales by special car to listen to the speech was unprecedented. Although George did not criticize the party system at the beginning of his speech, he said that political parties are indeed useful in ordinary times, but his advance has no party nature at all.</p>
<p>George detailed the collapse of the world economic system and said that although there had been predictions that trade in Britain was about to recover, in 1934 our country's trade deficit reached the highest record in peacetime. If Britain has a more courageous foreign policy in diplomacy and commerce, then commerce will definitely improve, and those who can absorb temporary unemployment, all undertakings that can increase national assets, can absorb permanent unemployment. The finances required for this plan should be limited to assets that can be raised annually without harming ordinary commercial operations. He believes that it can prosper the country's debt, and will definitely be happily purchased by the public. National credit should not be used too much. The previous plans of the Bank of England can be said to be misleading, short-sighted and leave future troubles. He is not saying that the Bank of England should be a part of the government, but that the directors of the bank should be carefully selected to have closer contact with industry and commerce. He can nationalize banks that will be established jointly. George then briefly outlined his plan as follows: (1) British-American cooperation to guarantee world peace; (2) Actively use Britain's tariffs and other negotiation tools to eliminate international trade barriers; (3) Organize real public undertakings to absorb permanently unemployed people and settle more people in farming; (4) Establish a committee with power but no party nature to plan and implement the plan, and raise funds; (5) Organize a committee of five cabinet members according to the wartime cabinet method to constantly consider domestic and foreign policy issues. (Reuters Telegraph, 17th)</p>
<p>(London) Former Labour cabinet Chancellor of the Exchequer Snowden published a letter to Liberal Party leader Lloyd George. This letter has aroused great attention in political circles, because Snowden's letter contains the intention of supporting George. Snowden said that the movement advocated by George that the whole country should make great efforts to prosper industry and relieve the people's poverty should be supported by the electors. George will give a speech in Bangor today to explain his new plan to prosper the country, and Snowden's letter was published last night. Snowden said that the people have been waiting for a long time to get a leader who can carry out a great national plan. If the country's efforts are spent on waste, and if the great power of Britain is organized and actively used, then unemployment can definitely be eradicated, and the high living standards of labor can also be achieved. He can see it put into practice and solve this problem. In between, Mr. Shi will sometimes give speeches in the same place as George. George will announce his new plan in September, but I will explain that the methods he intends are by no means political and party-based, and he does not want to promote liberalism, socialism, capitalism, or any other doctrine, but a sincere contribution to solving the current great difficulties. The national management of the Bank of England is a part of his plan, but not all of it. After the details are published, the people will be able to judge before the next election. He intends that a general election may be held within the next eighteen months. It is said that Snowden was the mainstay of the MacDonald Labour cabinet. Later, because MacDonald agreed to cooperate with the Conservative Party, Shi resigned and went into opposition. Lloyd George was the British Prime Minister during the war and is one of the most prestigious figures in British political circles. (Reuters Telegraph, 17th)</p>

<h3>International Commercial Telegram</h3>
<p>丨Reuters Special Commercial News Telegram, January 17th丨</p>
<h3>Gold and Silver</h3>

<h3>Exchange Rates</h3>
<p>British-American: The London foreign exchange market has been very volatile recently, but the market was calm this morning, with little fluctuation. The British-American exchange rate opened at 4 dollars 87 and 75 cents, the same as yesterday's American-British closing price. After falling to 4 dollars 87 and 6875 cents once, the price rose again to 4 dollars 87 and 9375 cents, which is the most recent price. Also, 1 US dollar equals 4 shillings 1 penny 186 British gold.</p>
<p>British-French: Opened unchanged at 74 francs 28. This price has not changed until the time of the telegram.</p>
<p>American-British: The New York foreign exchange market is gradually returning to normal today. The American-British exchange rate opened at 4 dollars 88 and 25 cents, up half a cent. Within an hour of opening, there were occasional fluctuations, but not far from this price. The American-French exchange rate was firmer, opening at 6 dollars 57 and 875 cents, up 1 cent and 125.</p>
<h3>Cotton and Wheat</h3>
<p>New York Cotton: The allocation of the Penhaid cotton field quota will be announced by the Department of Agriculture at 11 am this morning, so the focus of the cotton market is mostly on this. The opening was stable, and industry demand remained good, so the price rose, about 25 cents per bale. After the price rose, selling pressure increased sharply, and the price quickly fell back to yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>New York Wheat: The wheat market opened relatively stable, but unpredictable. Prices changed little from yesterday's close. The weather report was unfavorable, and the cold was even more severe in the winter wheat region.</p>
<p>Bombay Cotton: Today's cotton market saw sellers covering shorts, absorbing long positions being liquidated. The closing price for April-May White Rose cotton was 241 rupees and 7 annas, up 1 anna.</p>

<p>New York: The opening price rose 6 points today, but the price fell slightly due to retail sales.</p>
<h3>Securities</h3>
<p>New York: The factors favorable to the market before the securities opening were that yesterday's movement in the securities market could be seen as a calmer attitude among market participants before the Gold Clause decision. Short positions have recently increased greatly, so the market is expected to improve due to increased confidence. Coupled with good commercial news, the market is gradually looking good. The unfavorable factor for the market is the uncertainty of the Gold Clause issue, which still has a limited impact on trading. The securities market opened sluggish but stable this morning, with most securities slightly up. The Gold Clause case still makes people uneasy, so the market seems to have a sluggish and narrow trend today.</p>
<p>According to a Reuters report, although the Gold Clause dispute is still an important factor on Wall Street this morning, the market was able to calm down yesterday, and morale improved as a result. The securities exchange's base is strong, as is the same for other markets. Speakers therefore expect that prices in the stock market may gradually improve this morning. After the market opened this morning, trading was still not active, but most stocks were slightly higher. There are still some signs of panic in the market, so the market may not change drastically soon. The New York stock market prices are listed on the left:</p>

They are scheduled to travel west to Xi'an on the 15th. The following is a record of the group's departure and visit.</p>
<p>The inspection group of eighteen members is led by Hiraoka Kotaro, director of the Japanese Textile Industry Association in China. The other seventeen members include Kōichi Kamiya of Fukusho Company, Masamori Man'i of Daido Yōshi Store, Ikutarō Tanabe of Iwaki Shōkai, Setsuzō Imazawa of Yokohama Specie Bank, Tetsu Takahashi of Dairyo Rubber Factory, and Ichiji Higo, etc., six people as Group A. Except for Ichiji Higo, who went south to Beijing to visit Okano when he was in Xuzhou, the rest all went north back to Qingdao. Kin'ichi Yamamuro of Zuifeng Cotton Store, Takayuki Maeda of Okura Yōkō, Haruhito Asai of Asai Shōten, Setsuji Uchida of Ryūkō Textile Factory, Yōshaku Suetake of Suetake Shōten, Masahisa Kawai of Nikka Sanshi Kai, Yasuyoshi Shiraishi of Shiraishi Yōkō, Iwao Ogawa of Shōwa Yōkō, Tadao Shimazu and Kōkō Izawa of Qingdao Chamber of Commerce and Industry, and Takeo Mizuno of Mitsui Bussan, together with the leader Hiraoka Kotaro, twelve people as Group B, plan to visit Xi'an, Zhengzhou, and Tianjin before returning within the month. Except for Mizuno Takeo, who departed from Qingnan, the other seventeen people all claimed to have come from Qingdao. All eighteen members of the inspection group hold passports issued by the Japanese consuls in Qingdao or Jinan, with a two-month validity period. Before the inspection began, Qingdao Mayor Shen Honglie telegraphed the Guanyun County Government and other local governments along the way to send personnel to greet and escort them. The group departed from Qingdao on the Jiaoji Railway on the 10th, stayed overnight in Jinan, and on the 11th, took the Jinpu Railway south. They arrived in Xuzhou on the morning of the 12th, where they were greeted by personnel from the Xuzhou local government, and immediately transferred to the Longhai Railway eastward. At Xin'anzhen, they were replaced by personnel from the coastal local government for escort. At half past four in the afternoon, the train arrived in Xinpu. Because it was already dark, it was inconvenient to go ahead, so they stayed in Xinpu at the Datong Hotel.</p>
<p>At half past six on the morning of the 13th, the group of eighteen people, escorted by personnel from the coastal local government, took the Longhai Railway train to Laoyao at ten o'clock.

They were led by Zhang Jiechao, director of the Port Affairs Office of the Longhai Railway Administration, and Dong Yaotang, chief of the western section, to visit the pier. The No. 2 pier is nearing completion, and two ships are already berthed on the west bank. The No. 1 pier is being paved with stones, and the Henan Company, which is contracting the project, is busy transporting stones with small trains. The members of the inspection group paid close attention to the water depth, high terrain, import and export goods, and local commerce. Cotton was of particular interest to the Japanese, who tore the cotton by hand to test the length of its fibers. Hiraoka Kotaro intended to see Mr. Hamm, the director of the port construction, but was unable to find him because it was a Sunday. Due to the short time, they did not have time to go up the mountain and enter the town, so at eleven o'clock, they took the train eastward and arrived in Xinpu at two o'clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>From Xinpu Station to the Datong Hotel in the street, the local government provided four cars for the inspection group to use. When the car arrived in front of the Datong Hotel, Kin'ichi Yamamuro and three others got out of the car and asked the local government personnel to allow the entire group to take the original car to Dapū, their intention was very firm at first. After the local government personnel repeatedly informed them that the road was muddy due to rain, making it inconvenient for the car to travel, and that there were many bandits in the countryside, fearing accidents, they stopped. The inspection group then entered the hotel to rest. After a short rest, Hiraoka Kotaro and Ichiji Higo requested to visit the airfield, which they immediately did. In addition, eleven people, including Yasuyoshi Shiraishi, visited the river, while two others went to visit the street.</p>
<p>Because they were busy visiting during the day and did not have time to eat, they had their meal at four o'clock in the afternoon. After the meal, they rested at the hotel.</p>
<p>At forty minutes past eleven on the morning of the 14th, the inspection group of eighteen people took a car to Xuzhou. The six people in Group A took the Jinpu Railway train to various places in the north and south that day. Group B scheduled to travel west to Xi'an on the 15th.</p>
<p>According to Hiraoka Kotaro and Kin'ichi Yamamuro, Lianyungang seems a bit small. When the two piers are completely completed, they can only berth six ships of 3,000 tons or less, which cannot be compared to the Qingdao pier, which can berth more than 25 ships of 10,000 tons or more. But it is still a good port for handling goods. Lianyungang is close to Qingdao, and they should cooperate and promote communication between commercial ships to seek the development of Sino-Japanese trade, and so on.</p>
<h3>Situation Passing Through Xuzhou</h3>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Japanese residents in Qingdao, recognizing that the Longhai Railway, connecting the Central Plains, opening the port of Lianyungang to the east, and reaching Chang'an to the west, has a tendency to replace Qingdao in terms of geographical advantages, and that the railway also occupies an important position in national defense and commerce, have organized the Longhai Railway Lianyungang Industrial and Commercial Inspection Group, a party of eighteen people. The head of the group is Hiraoka Kotaro, director of the Japanese Textile Manufacturers Association in China, and Izawa Kimiyuki, head of the Qingdao Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, is assisting in the arrangements. The group departed from Qingdao via Jinan to Xuzhou on the 12th, and then traveled east by train. Local administrative authorities received a telegram from the provincial government in advance to provide adequate protection. The Administrative Commissioner's Office dispatched Yu Keyu, the County Government dispatched Chen Jiesan, and the Public Security Bureau dispatched Zhao Yiqian to accompany the group. The Longhai Railway Bureau also dispatched General Section Chief Dong Yaotang to accompany and entertain the group. The group arrived in Xinpu on the evening of the 12th. On the morning of the 13th, the Longhai Railway prepared a special train to transport the group to various places such as Xugou Sunjiashan Lao Yao for sightseeing. In particular, they inquired in detail about the depth of the sea in the Lao Yao port, the draft of the ships, and the height of the mountains, and observed them on the map separately. At that time, they also planned to take photos, but the accompanying administrative staff politely dissuaded them. They expressed dissatisfaction with this obstruction. That evening, they returned to Xinpu by train. Due to the rain and muddy roads, the journey was inconvenient. On the morning of the 14th, they took the Longhai Express train west again, arriving in Xuzhou at 8:30 that night.</p>
<p>After the group arrived in Xuzhou and got off the train, they were guided by local government officials to stay at the Huayuan Hotel. In addition to most of the group heading west for inspection, group member Higo took the Jinpu train south that evening to go to the capital for business. In addition, group members Takahashi, Murai, Okaba, Imazawa, and Kamiya, five people in total, took the train north back to Jinan at 6:30 on the morning of the 15th. The majority of the group, led by Hiraoka, toured various scenic spots in Xuzhou on the morning of the 15th and inspected the commercial market situation, and went to various foreign goods firms to investigate the sales volume of Japanese goods, and at the same time made preparations for supply.</p>
<p>After the group arrived in Xuzhou and before leaving Xuzhou on the 15th, the reporter visited them twice. Hiraoka Kotaro and Izawa Kimiyuki were elected by the group to receive the reporter. The reporter asked them about the purpose of this inspection and their impressions after visiting Xuzhou and Lianyungang. They replied that they had been engaged in industry and commerce in Qingdao for more than ten years and had rarely traveled to the Chinese mainland. Taking advantage of the slack season at the end of the year and the beginning of the year, they organized the Longhai Railway inspection group to visit the seaports along the eastern section to the west. Lianyungang is very close to Qingdao and is related to the famous commercial ports in the East. After inspection, they praised the greatness of the port's construction. However, they felt that the Lao Yao wharf was located at the foot of the mountain and could not be developed. In the future, the construction of houses would be quite limited, and it seemed that it could not be fully developed. The Lao Yao wharf for loading and unloading goods was also narrow. Compared with Shanghai and Qingdao, it was slightly inferior, but it was located between the two ports and had a great relationship in connecting the ports. They came here and planned to engage in business within the possible range. This trip to the west was intended to stop in Zhengzhou and Luoyang for sightseeing, and then go straight to Xi'an, and after a few days in An Xun, they would return to Qingdao via Zhengjing Beiping.</p>
<p>The group toured Xuzhou for half a day and left Xuzhou on the 15th at 12:40 noon, taking the Longhai Westbound Special Express train to Zhengzhou. Their original plan was to get off the train in Kaifeng, but later decided to go straight to Luoyang. If there were Japanese residents waiting for them in Zhengzhou, they planned to get off the train there, otherwise they would stop in Luoyang. They also planned to visit Mount Hua when they arrived in Huayin. They planned to stay in Xi'an for three days and then return east and then to Beiping. According to the administrative staff accompanying the group, the group paid close attention to the geographical situation in the places they visited, and often asked where the airfield was, where the barracks were, and where the fortress area was. Their actions did not seem like a simple tour and inspection, according to the Central News Agency.</p>
<h3>Major Panic in Xiamen's Financial World</h3>
<p>Three Major Money Houses Collapse in Five Days</p>
<p>Xiamen Commercial Bank Also Closes</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: After the New Year, a major panic suddenly broke out in Xiamen's financial world. In one week, the three major money houses of Huang Jianyuan, Yu Feng, and Yinjiang collapsed one after another. Jianyuan and Yu Feng had been established for more than 20 years, had a good reputation, and the most abundant capital, and were the largest and most famous money houses in Xiamen. Unexpectedly, on the 12th, Xiamen's only Xiamen Commercial Bank also announced its closure.</p>
<p>On January 6, Yinjiang Money House on Shuixian Road announced its closure. Manager Li Zhai went into hiding, owing people 170,000 to 180,000 yuan, deposits of more than 200,000 yuan, and owing banks more than 100,000 yuan, with a total debt of about 500,000 yuan. On the 9th, Huang Jianyuan, a famous money house in Xiamen, also ran aground. Huang Jianyuan was operated by Huang Shijin, a wealthy businessman in Xiamen. Huang's operations included Jianyuan Bank, Jianfeng Grocery, and Jiansheng Pawnshop, and also engaged in savings mortgages. All had been open for decades and had a good reputation in Xiamen. Hong Kong had a branch called Jianyuan Zhan, and Shanghai had Jianji Remittance Bank. After Yinjiang closed, Jianyuan suddenly experienced a run. Huang planned to mortgage 500,000 yuan of assets to the Bank of China for 200,000 yuan to cope with the situation, but unfortunately it failed, and he announced a shutdown. Jiansheng Pawnshop was also trapped in a shutdown. Deposits and debts totaled more than 1.2 million yuan, and all assets and debts owed could be offset. For a time, people were shocked, and the financial storm expanded further. On the 10th, Yu Feng Money House, operated by Liao Yuefa, a leader in the city's money house industry, whose capital and reputation were comparable to Jianyuan, also stopped business because it could not cope with depositors' withdrawals. Debts also reached more than 1 million yuan. In total, the three houses collapsed in succession in five days, with debts reaching more than 2.5 million yuan, and people were even more panicked. On the 12th, Xiamen's only Xiamen Commercial Bank also suspended business due to withdrawals. Xiamen Commercial Bank was established in the 11th year of the Republic, with a capital of 600,000 yuan, and later increased by 60,000 yuan, totaling 660,000 yuan. It had a branch in Shanghai and an office in Ningbo, and had a good reputation. On Saturday the 12th, the treasury had only more than 40,000 yuan in stock. The depositors continued to arrive after the bank opened at nine o'clock. Manager Ouyang Ze, seeing that Jianyuan and Yu Feng had closed successively in two days, and that Huang Shijin, a shareholder of Jianyuan, and Liao Yuefa, a shareholder of Yu Feng, were both directors of Xiamen Bank, was already wary. On the one hand, he first borrowed money from Huang Boquan, president of the Bank of China (also a director of Xiamen Bank), Huang Qinshu, president of the Bank of Communications (also a director of Xiamen Bank), and Ye Tianxuan, president of Zhongxing Bank, to maintain the situation. Huang (Qinshu) and Ye initially agreed. Ouyang then ordered the staff to silently record the number of withdrawals on the morning of the 12th, promising to pay them later. He went to the two banks to urge the loans, but the loan matter suddenly changed. Those waiting to withdraw money at Xiamen Bank had more than 30,000 yuan by 10:30, and suddenly increased to 70,000 to 80,000 yuan at 11:00. The treasury had only more than 40,000 yuan in stock, which was not enough to pay. He announced that payments would be temporarily suspended until Monday, the 14th, to resolve the issue. The bank convened a board meeting on the 13th, which was a Sunday. Huang Yizhu (represented by Huang Yishou), Liao Yuefa (represented by Wu Shihan), Chen Qingbo, Zeng Shangyuan, Huang Boquan, Chen Yitang, Shen Jinting, Zhang Naiping, Huang Zhitin, and Huang Qinshu attended the meeting and resolved to "temporarily suspend business for 15 days from the 14th, and convene a temporary shareholders' meeting on the 30th of this month to resolve everything." The board of directors hired lawyer Du Baoqi and accountant Wang Yunyu to handle legal and accounting matters. On the morning of the 14th, the bank posted a notice, which read, "Due to the tight financial situation in the market, the bank has temporarily suspended business for 15 days after a resolution by the board of directors, pending the convening of a temporary shareholders' meeting in accordance with Article 16, Section 2 of the bank's articles of association to resolve all matters. January 14, 24th year." It also submitted a report to the Public Security Bureau, which read, "Recently, due to the tight money supply in the market, all loans have not been recovered, and all deposits have been withdrawn due to the impact of withdrawals from various money houses. Business has been temporarily suspended for 15 days after a resolution by the board of directors to convene a shareholders' meeting to resolve the issue. During this period, the accounts will be sorted out and reported to the meeting. Please send police to protect the bank," etc.</p>
<p>It is rumored that Xiamen Bank absorbed more than 4 million yuan in deposits. According to Liu Yunsong, deputy manager of the bank, "Xiamen Bank has temporarily suspended business due to a temporary cash flow problem. The Shanghai branch and the Ningbo office under the Shanghai branch will not be suspended. The Shanghai branch has sent a telegram requesting instructions and has replied that it will handle the situation as it sees fit. The bank's deposits reached more than 3 million yuan at the peak. In recent years, the market has been sluggish and the money supply has been tight, and more than half of the deposits have been withdrawn. The current fixed-term and current deposits are more than 1.5 million yuan, plus more than 2 million yuan in transactions with various counterparts. The bank's assets are sufficient to offset the debts," etc.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for the financial turmoil in Xiamen this time is that the price of gold has soared in the past three years, and commerce in Nanyang has declined. Overseas Chinese in Nanyang have no business to operate, and the exchange rate is high, so they are competing to remit money back to China. However, the hometowns of the overseas Chinese in southern Fujian have been plagued by bandits for years, and they dare not invest in the mainland. This large amount of capital returning to the country is concentrated in Xiamen, and its channels for disposal are (1) investing in real estate and building municipal houses, and (2) depositing in banks and money houses. Xiamen has been building roads and new markets for only a few years, and the construction is all new. The buildings are lined up and there is almost no space, and most of them are four-story steel frames, and the construction is very sophisticated, all of which is the capital of overseas Chinese. As a result, land prices in Xiamen soared two years ago. For example, the old site of Guandi Temple on Datong Road rose to 4,000 yuan per square foot. The rent is so high that a three- or four-story building on Zhongshan Datong Road that is only 1.2 feet wide costs more than 200 yuan per month. In addition to investing in real estate, they deposit in banks and money houses. Last summer, the Chamber of Commerce investigated and found that the deposits received by various banks reached more than 40 million yuan. Although the number of deposits received by money houses is unknown, it can be known that it exceeds the number of banks. In recent years, the market has been sluggish, and stores are competing to hold low-price sales, but few people care. As a result, closures are common, and municipal houses are empty. As a result, land prices have plummeted, and the money industry is unable to recover loans. For example, the price of a square foot on Datong Road that was sold for 4,000 yuan before is now 800 yuan and no one cares. Tenants are competing to reduce rents. Monthly rents of more than 200 yuan have fallen to more than 100 yuan, and there are still many vacant buildings along Zhongshan Shengping Road. Banks and money houses absorb deposits and invest a lot in real estate. Since no one cares about real estate and houses, cash is therefore dead. At the same time, the money supply is extremely tight, and there are many withdrawals, so exhaustion appears. It also happened to be near the end of the lunar year, and there was a great need for cash. No one was willing to accept mortgages on real estate and houses, and the lending merchants were unable to recover their loans, so Jianyuan and Yu Feng collapsed, and the repercussions became a major wave. Xiamen Commercial Bank had no choice but to be involved. On the 13th, the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the city, stating that the financial panic in the city was becoming increasingly dangerous, and that a joint meeting would be held this afternoon (the 14th) at 2:00 pm, inviting local authorities such as the Public Security Bureau, the Siming County Magistrate, the presidents of various banks, various trade associations, and all members of the executive and supervisory committees of the chamber to discuss relief measures. At present, people are still very agitated, and we are waiting for the results of the joint meeting to shift the situation. (January 14)</p>
<h3>Fujian Provincial Pacification Conference</h3>
<p>Fourteen Commanders and Division Commanders Attended</p>
<p>Sixty-Seven Proposals Passed in Two-Day Meeting</p>
<p>Zhangzhou Correspondence: Jiang Dingwen, the special envoy for pacification stationed in Fujian, considering that the pacification mission was heavy and in order to pool ideas, returned to Zhangzhou from the province on the 4th of this month and telegraphed all commanders of subordinate districts and division commanders stationed in Fujian to Zhangzhou to hold a provincial pacification conference to decide on all operational guidelines and implementation steps. The conference opened on the morning of the 10th and closed on the afternoon of the 11th. Four meetings were held in two days, and 67 proposals were passed. The details of the process are recorded below.</p>
<h3>Attendees</h3>
<p>The attendees were Li Yannan, Commander of the 11th Pacification Zone, Wang Jingjiu, Commander of the 12th Pacification Zone, Wang Jicheng, representative of Liu Heding, Commander of the 9th Pacification Zone (Chief of Staff of the Command), Guo Jiqiao, representative of Wei Lihuang, Commander of the 10th Pacification Zone (Chief of Staff of the Command), Li Yutang, Commander of the 3rd Division, Peng Shuru, Deputy Commander of the 10th Division, Zhang Yiyang, representative of the 36th Division, Dai Minquan, Commander of the 45th Division, Lu Xingrong, Commander of the 52nd Division, Chen Qi, Commander of the 80th Division, Liu Kan, Commander of the 83rd Division, Shi Honglie, Deputy Commander of the 87th Division, and Ding Jianfan, Deputy Commander of the New 11th Division, etc., totaling 14 people. Li Jianai, Chief of Staff of the Pacification Headquarters, Zhang Jiong, Chief Advisor, and Shao Qiyong, Tian Xiyuan, Wang Qibo, Feng Chizhong, Yang Huaidang, and Li Yi, directors of various departments, also attended the meeting.</p>
<h3>Meeting Details</h3>
<p>The meeting venue was set up in the main hall on the third floor of the Pacification Headquarters. The first meeting opened at 10:00 am on the 10th. After performing the ceremonial formalities, Chairman Jiang Dingwen delivered the opening remarks, which read, "Gentlemen, we entered Fujian from Jiangxi in the 22nd year of the Republic to suppress bandits and quell rebellions. After a year, we have finally come to an end. During this year, because you were all on the front lines and had your own missions, we did not have the opportunity to gather together. Now we have entered the pacification period, and although the situation is more relaxed, the mission has become more onerous. In order to easily achieve the goal of pacification, I have specially invited you to the headquarters to conduct in-depth discussions. Now, I will first report the important tasks and significance of pacification as follows. The task of pacification is first to eliminate scattered bandits in the shortest possible time. This is without a doubt. Now that the national crisis is deep and the people's difficulties have not been relieved, it is not enough to talk about internal peace if the scattered bandits are not eliminated, and it is not enough to resist foreign aggression. To eliminate scattered bandits, it is even more necessary to complete transportation, organize the people, handle the aftermath of bandit areas, and reorganize local teams, all at the same time, as a fundamental solution. As for the people's armed forces in various places, Fujian has a special situation, and the number is particularly large. Most of them have been loyal to the party and the country and participated in the revolutionary movement. We also intend to work with Chairman Chen to conduct a thorough verification and separately reorganize them into provincial security regiments and county security teams, and actively reorganize and train them for national use. If there are still a few who do not cherish themselves and are outside the group, and ultimately do evil, we can only proceed with the purpose of pacification and actively handle it, so that the people's pain can be relieved as soon as possible and the local area can be stabilized as soon as possible. All government construction plans can be realized as soon as possible. I hope that you will follow this main point, discuss it in depth, and follow the spirit of the leader of the committee, who is determined to overcome all difficulties, and to work hard, practically, and resolutely, so that you will not fail the trust of the central government and the expectations of the people." After the speech, the discussion of various proposals began, and the meeting adjourned at 12:00. Jiang Dingwen hosted a banquet at his private residence on Xianhou Street for the participants to gather. The second meeting continued at 2:00 pm and adjourned at 5:00 pm. The third meeting opened at 10:00 am on the 11th and adjourned at 12:00 pm. At noon, the officials of the Pacification Headquarters hosted a banquet for the attendees at the Ziyuan Hotel. The fourth meeting continued at 2:00 pm. Jiang Dingwen delivered the closing remarks and adjourned the meeting after taking a group photo.</p>
<h3>Types of Proposals</h3>
<p>A total of 67 proposals were passed at the two-day meeting, including 13 on reorganizing local teams and eliminating remnants of bandits, 10 on training the people and clearing the countryside and organizing the baojia system, 12 on building roads and adding telegraphs and telephones, 15 on pacifying refugees and handling local aftermath, 3 on promoting market prosperity and rescuing rural areas, 2 on promoting the New Life Movement, 4 on the powers and expenses of various pacification zones and their subordinate organizations, and 8 on military transportation.</p>
<h3>Report to the Capital</h3>
<p>After the meeting closed, Jiang Dingwen hosted a banquet at his private residence at 6:00 pm that evening to bid farewell to the attending commanders, division commanders, and representatives. The commanders and division commanders all returned to their defense posts on the 12th. Jiang originally planned to go to the capital in person to report everything, but since he could not make the trip, he decided to send Li Jianai, Chief of Staff of the Pacification Headquarters, as a representative to report to the central government and meet with Chairman Jiang to ask for instructions on everything. It is heard that Chief of Staff Li will take the plane north as soon as the proposals are sorted out.</p>
<h3>Central Government Sends Commissioners to Songjiang to Investigate Land</h3>
<p>Since the land survey work in Songjiang County began under the guidance of Wang Shaoyou, the special district investigator of the Land Committee, the work has been progressing smoothly, and the party and government sides have been cooperating effectively. In order to provide on-the-ground guidance, Wang has started the first phase of sampling inspections. Since the 10th, he has successively completed sampling inspections in Zhangze Tinglin Jinshanwei and Hua Yang Xinzhuang Fengjing Tianmashan districts in Punan and Pubei. Whenever Wang arrives at a place, he must first inquire in detail about the investigation process from the county investigators, review the completed forms, and give detailed instructions separately. Then, he immediately sets off with them for sampling inspections. His actions are extremely swift and his attitude is very amiable, so the people in all places can tell him the truth. The results of the sampling inspections are very good. Wang also believes that local party affairs, education, winter defense, and other undertakings are closely related to the revitalization of rural areas. Therefore, he has successively inspected the second district party headquarters and the first branch of the third district, visited Huayang Yandong Zhel Linwei City and other elementary schools, and the winter defense organizations in various places. He also gave a speech in Yandong. He also inquired in detail about the situation of the salt fields, the lives of the salt farmers, and the Zhelincheng, where the generals Yu Dayou and Qi Jiguang put down the Japanese pirates, and the Punans Academy, where the sage Gu Tinglin encouraged agriculture and lectures, and their anecdotes. It is heard that his impressions of this trip will be reported to the central government in detail.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Requests Abolition of Vegetable Tax</h3>
<p>The vegetable market tax inside and outside Suzhou City is contracted by Wei Du to the county government, and 300 yuan is paid monthly. The contractor also dispatches a large number of tax collectors to collect taxes from various vegetable vendors. Whether they are peddlers or stallholders, they must pay the tax. Therefore, the vegetable vendors believe that the tax is excessive and disruptive. They submitted a petition to the county government a few days ago requesting the cancellation of the business license. Yesterday (the 17th), more than a dozen people from the business community, including Pang Tiansheng, Song Youpei, and Cheng Ganqing, jointly submitted a petition to the civil and financial departments and the county government, stating that the contracting system had been abolished long ago. Furthermore, the vegetable tax in Suzhou only amounted to 300 yuan per month in the government's revenue, while the contractor arbitrarily imposed excessive taxes and harassed the vendors in every way. These small vendors are making a small profit and cannot bear the harassment. Furthermore, this vegetable tax is one of the excessive taxes and miscellaneous levies and should be abolished by order to reduce the burden on the small people.</p>
<h3>Wuxi Yixing Liyang Refugees Sell Their Children</h3>
<p>Last year's drought and insect plague were the worst in 60 years. Yixing and Liyang counties in Jiangsu Province were the most severely affected. Residents of the disaster areas fled outwards en masse. At this time of severe winter weather, they were suffering from hunger and cold, and their cries of grief were unbearable. Although charitable organizations in various places are raising funds for relief, they are unable to help because of the large number of people. According to a visitor from Houqiao, a suburb of Wuxi, dozens of refugees from Yixing and Liyang have arrived in the area recently, begging from farmers. At the end of their tether, they painfully sold 12 of their children, large and small, to others for only a dozen or twenty yuan each. However, it is difficult to determine whether they are criminals taking the opportunity to abduct children.</p>
<h3>Suzhou Zhenjiang Continues to Catch Human Traffickers</h3>
<p>The Supervisory Department of the County Public Security Bureau cracked down on a general organization for human trafficking in the southeast in Xiang'anli and other places a few days ago, and detained 10 male and female criminals. The details have been recorded in yesterday's newspaper. It is now learned that the Public Security Bureau dispatched inspectors Ge and Wu again that day, carrying documents to Suzhou and Zhenjiang, and together with the police officers of the respective counties, cracked down on a branch organization at No. 24 Xiqilin Lane in Suzhou, and arrested the main criminal, Meng Ruifu. They also continued to arrest a female criminal, Jin Xiangyun, at No. 1 Changanli, Xiaojie, Zhenjiang. They were separately escorted back to Wuxi yesterday for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Major Fire at Northwest Corner of Nantong City at Midnight</h3>
<p>A sudden fire broke out at twelve o'clock on the 15th at the northwest corner of Nantong City, where the shops were lined up. Fire brigades from all roads rushed to the rescue. It was extinguished at three o'clock on the morning of the 16th. It is estimated that 13 shops, including Datong Lumber Yard and Xiangxing Basin Bucket Shop, were burned down.</p>
<h3>Method for Eliminating Smuggling Disputes</h3>
<p>Due to the conflict between the anti-smuggling tax police in Tonghai area and the villagers when inspecting salt, the tax police district chief and the county magistrate are discussing ways to eliminate smuggling disputes. It has been decided that for cases reported that are not caught in the act, the reporter should obtain a counter-prosecution pledge from the officers of each team at any time, and the district chief will issue a warrant to allow execution, and temporarily notify the township head of the location to report the search with the reporter to prevent abuses.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Province Public Bonds Mortgaged for 2 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Today's Discussion of Loan Contract</p>
<p>The Zhejiang Provincial Government, in urgent need of funds for various public works, disaster relief construction, and settlement of old debts, has decided to mortgage local public bonds with a face value of 10 million yuan from the 23rd year of the Republic of China to Shanghai banks for 6 million yuan at a 60% discount for application. It specially appointed Xu Qingfu, Director of the Department of Finance, to come to Shanghai to negotiate with various banks. After several days of negotiations in Shanghai, the banks considered that the end of the lunar year was approaching and it would be difficult to approve the full amount. It has now been decided to first borrow 2 million yuan, and the remaining 4 million yuan will be discussed after the lunar New Year. After the amount of the loan was determined, Xu decided to convene representatives of the borrowing banks, including China, Communications, Zhejiang Xingye, Zhejiang Industrial, China Industrial, Siming, Shanghai, Jin Cheng, Zhongnan, Yanyeh, Dalu, and Tongshang, today to discuss the draft mortgage loan contract in order to finalize and sign it as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Federation Issued a Declaration of Market Relief Yesterday</h3>
<p>Scheduled to Convene Industrial and Commercial Figures to Discuss Specific Measures</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, considering the increasing decline of industry and commerce and the impending collapse of the Shanghai market, is seeking ways to provide relief as a matter of urgent importance. The representative assembly has resolved on a relief plan. In order to concentrate efforts and actively proceed, it has been decided to convene various industrial and commercial organizations in the city on January 21 to discuss effective overall relief measures to alleviate the difficulties faced by businesses. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Scheduled Meeting</h3>
<p>The Federation sent letters to various organizations yesterday, scheduling a general meeting on the 21st of this month. The original letter stated: "Dear Sirs, the decline of industry and commerce and the slump in the market in recent years are unprecedented in the history of Shanghai's commercial prosperity and decline. In view of this, the Federation has submitted the following resolutions to the Fourth Representative Assembly: (A) A one-year extension of the general closure of industry and commerce, with interest settled as usual, and a six-month extension of rent payments. We hereby record these resolutions and respectfully inform you. We have scheduled a general meeting of representatives from various industrial and commercial organizations in the city at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 21st of this month to proceed together. The matter concerns the relief of the market situation, so we hope that you will send two representatives with a letter to attend and participate in order to gather diverse opinions and achieve greater benefits. Please do not delay."</p>
<h3>Declaration Published</h3>
<p>The Federation issued a declaration yesterday, stating: "The decline of the Shanghai market is a fact that is obvious to everyone and cannot be denied. All citizens with a vested interest should immediately take action to seek relief in order to avoid mutual destruction. Historically, Shanghai has been a base for economic aggression by various countries, and its collapse would be of little regret. However, if the Chinese people can utilize it properly, it can be transformed into a key to expanding foreign trade, reversing the trade deficit, and turning it into a trade surplus. Some attribute the decline of the Shanghai market to the resistance against Japan on January 28. In fact, the Shanghai market was able to survive until this year before showing an even greater decline, which was due to the benefits of the January 28 incident. Before January 28, the frenzy of speculation in Shanghai's real estate was like the scorching sun at midday. There were countless instances of raising rents, forcing evictions, and rebuilding to benefit oneself at the expense of others, so that citizens had to reduce other essential needs in order to meet the insatiable demands of real estate speculators. After the January 28 incident, this trend subsided slightly, and the rent reduction movement was able to begin. Otherwise, the continued increase in rents would not have stopped. Therefore, the primary factor contributing to the decline of the Shanghai market was real estate speculation. The second factor was the years of famine and banditry in the interior, which led to the disappearance of purchasing power in rural areas, resulting in the stagnation of Shanghai goods. The third factor was the lack of sales channels for industry and commerce, so businesses used stages, extensive advertising, and erected electric light arches to attract customers. One store did this, and then a hundred stores did this. One industry did this, and then a hundred industries did this. Business remained the same, but expenses increased. However, outsiders and real estate speculators still claimed that stores were crowded with customers and business was booming. In reality, those standing there were listening to the radio, watching discount advertisements, and admiring the electric light signs. It was just people watching people. There were no real customers. The Federation convened a representative assembly on January 16 to discuss in detail how to relieve the depression in the Shanghai market and the decline of industry and commerce. The assembly unanimously resolved: (A) To extend the general closure of industry and commerce for one year, with interest settled as usual. (1) To issue a declaration. (2) To petition the party and government organs to issue a clear order of approval. (3) To send letters to the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and various industrial and commercial organizations to proceed together. (B) To petition the Executive Yuan to instruct the Ministry of Finance to allocate loans from the Central Bank to relieve industry and commerce in Shanghai. (C) (1) To petition the municipal government and send letters to the Municipal Council to collect property taxes on vacant houses. (2) To petition the competent authorities to issue a clear order postponing rent payments for six months. (3) To petition the municipal government and send letters to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association to reduce rents. All of the above are merely the minimum measures required by the facts. Some may think that extending the general closure is too extraordinary and useless. It should be noted that distant examples include the postponement of American war bonds and German domestic debt, which were both clear and decisive actions taken by great statesmen in power. A recent example is the extension of the general closure in Shanghai after the January 28 incident, which was due to the efforts of Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at the time. Anyone in the market who is capable and active will be able to recognize the needs of the situation and express them to respond to extraordinary circumstances. If the above-mentioned measures are delayed, industry and commerce will disappear without a trace, and real estate will not only "sell for 70% off without a buyer or be mortgaged for 50% off." Under the circumstances where lenders only take in and do not release, it will also become worthless. What can be done with all businesses among the overflowing ranks of the unemployed? As for industry and commerce themselves, (1) those that can be merged should be merged, and those that can form business associations should do so. As the number of vacant houses in the market increases, it can reduce rents and encourage real estate speculators to return to their provinces, thereby lowering rents. (2) Minimize the use of electric lights, billboards, telephones, etc., and promote business methods to reduce expenses. If each store does this, the total amount of business will not increase. It will only increase expenses, increase costs, and make it more difficult to sell goods, thereby accelerating the rate of bankruptcy. If we can overcome this difficulty, and the interior improves next spring, purchasing power will recover, and goods will move, then we will enter a path of prosperity. Who can say for sure that this will not happen? It is precisely for the purpose of treating a serious illness quickly and then gradually recuperating and recovering. We also hope that municipal leaders like Yu Qiaqing will follow the example of 1927 and re-establish the Commercial Federation to respond to this extraordinary period in the market. This matter concerns the prosperity and decline of the Shanghai market. This declaration is hereby made for your public consideration. Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation, January 17, 1935."</p>
<h3>The Emergency Relief and Universal Donation Association Resolved to Continue Fundraising</h3>

The association is a support team for the Various Provinces' Drought Relief Association and intends to continue its efforts after the lunar New Year. Qu Wenliu also reported on the allocation of disaster relief donations to various provinces by the Various Provinces' Drought Relief Association (details omitted). The following matters were discussed: 1. To continue fundraising. 2. The principle of using donated funds for both bandit and drought disaster relief will be given equal importance. 3.

All requests for disaster relief should be forwarded to the Various Provinces' Drought Relief Association for processing.</p>
<p>The association is actively working on donations from the wealthy and is adopting effective measures to reach a strong resolution so that all wealthy individuals in the city can donate to help the disaster victims. The association also received the following donations yesterday: Yarn Industry Association, 100 foreign dollars; National Bank, 88.60 yuan in large silver dollars and 50 cents in small silver dollars; Meiwen Electric Silk Weaving Factory, 73.40 yuan in large silver dollars; East Asia Hotel, 27.80 yuan in large silver dollars and 78 cents in small silver dollars; Chengdong Elementary School, 5.20 yuan in large silver dollars and 78 cents in small silver dollars, and 6 copper coins; Songchun Elementary School, 7 yuan in large silver dollars and 52 cents in small silver dollars, and 23 copper coins; Minguang School, 42 cents in small silver dollars; Maicun Elementary School, 1 yuan in large silver dollars and 46 cents in small silver dollars; Qiming Girls' Middle School, 50 yuan in large silver dollars; Qiming Girls' Elementary School, 42 yuan in large silver dollars; Dagong Elementary School, 5 yuan in large silver dollars and 174 cents in small silver dollars, and 376 copper coins.</p>
<h3>Suma Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Visited the Japanese Ambassador to Report Everything, Scheduled to Enter Beijing Within Days</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Suma, the Japanese Consul General in Beijing, was summoned back to his country last year to report everything to the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs. Having completed his report, he toured various ports such as Pingjin and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM on the Dalian Steamship Company's Fengtian Maru from Qingdao, which docked at the Huishan Wharf. His friends in Shanghai welcomed him at the port. After disembarking, he went to the Japanese Consulate General to meet with Japanese Ambassador Arimasa Akira and reported on his return to Japan. He is scheduled to leave Shanghai for Beijing within one or two days to assume his duties.</p>
<h3>Consular Body Selects Consuls for the Year</h3>
<p>Mr. Cunningham, the American Consul General and leader of the consular body in Shanghai, recently informed the Municipal Council that the American, British, and Japanese Consuls General have been publicly elected as the Consuls for the Year for the consular body, and Mr. Lange will continue to serve as the secretary. His correspondence address is the American Consulate General.</p>
<p>The leading consul also notified the Municipal Council that the consular body has designated the Dutch, Swiss, and Swedish Consuls General to serve as directors of the Public Hospital for this year. In the event of an absence, their respective acting Consuls General will take their place.</p>
<p>In addition, according to consular practice, three prison inspectors are elected each year to form an inspection committee. The acting Polish Consul General (Chairman), the German Vice Consul, and the British Consul have been selected to serve. The secretary of the committee will be the secretary of the consular body.</p>
<h3>River Waters Recede, Few Ships</h3>
<p>The water level in the Sichuan River has been receding sharply in recent days, and shipping has also declined. The transportation of goods from Shanghai to Sichuan has completely stopped, and the number of ships has been greatly reduced. The situation is described in detail below:</p>
<h3>Great Reduction in Chinese Ships</h3>
<p>In recent years, various small Chinese steamship companies operating on the Shanghai-Sichuan River route have suffered from business depression and price drops and have closed down one after another. However, the number of ships of the Minsheng Company has increased. Most of the ships of small companies have been merged into the Minsheng Company. Therefore, Minsheng Company has the greatest influence on the Shanghai-Chongqing, Yichang-Chongqing, and inland ships. Recently, troops are being transferred to Sichuan to suppress the communists. There is a need for commercial ships to be used for military purposes in the Sichuan River. Many Chinese commercial ships have been requisitioned, resulting in a great reduction in Chinese ships on the Shanghai-Chongqing and Yichang-Chongqing routes in recent days, a decrease of three-quarters compared to normal. Foreign commercial ships have also switched to smaller, shallow-draft vessels due to the low water level.</p>
<h3>Suspension of Passenger and Freight Services</h3>
<p>Two weeks ago, the exchange rate for Sichuan currency in Shanghai rose to 1,700 yuan. Although it has fallen slightly recently, it is still around 1,500 yuan. Due to the exchange rate, it is extremely uneconomical to send goods from Shanghai. For example, goods that cost one yuan in Shanghai cost two yuan in Sichuan. Passengers have been affected by this, and the transportation of goods from Shanghai to Sichuan has been temporarily suspended. Recently, due to the suppression of the communists and the approach of the lunar New Year, the transportation of goods to Sichuan has been affected by the inability to turn over funds in time, so people have stopped purchasing goods. According to people in the Sichuan business community, goods will not be available for loading until after the Lantern Festival (15th day of the first lunar month).</p>
<h3>Two Important Telegrams from the All-Zhejiang Association Regarding Drought Relief</h3>
<p>Seed Grain Should be Purchased in the Same County or Neighboring County to Suit the Soil</p>
<p>Water Conservancy Projects Should Focus on Local Tributaries and Small Rivers</p>
<h3>Purchase and Distribution of Seed Grain</h3>
<p>To Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government: The drought last summer was too severe, and in the severely affected areas, the rice crops failed completely. Those that had some harvest had dry and shriveled rice grains that could not be stored as seeds. Now that winter has arrived, the disaster-stricken farmers are facing starvation and freezing. It is not easy for them to even feed themselves, let alone have the resources to purchase seed grain. Spring plowing is approaching, and the spring planting season is about to begin. If seed grain is not provided for them, the farmers will be unable to plant, and the fertile fields will become barren. This will lead to continuous crop failures. It is important to seize the opportunity during this winter season to purchase the grain. If this is delayed, the grain will be milled into rice and stones, making it difficult to purchase. Please instruct the Relief Commission to quickly purchase and store a large amount of seed grain and send letters to the county governments to instruct the district townships to distribute the grain to the extremely poor farmers after verifying their identities. If there are concerns about insufficient funds, please allocate funds from the one million yuan of relief funds for this purpose. As there are differences in soil suitability for seed grain, the seed grain distributed to a particular county should be purchased from a nearby area with suitable soil to ensure growth. This matter concerns the preparation for disaster relief and should not be treated as a slow matter. Therefore, we are sending this telegram for your consideration and implementation. It would be in the public interest. The Shanghai All-Zhejiang Association, sincerely.</p>
<h3>Expediting the Repair of Water Conservancy Projects</h3>
<p>To Chairman Huang of the Zhejiang Provincial Government: The 20 million yuan of Zhejiang Province public bonds, approved by the Legislative Yuan, will be mostly used for public works. Since Committee Chairman Chiang issued the telegraphed announcement, the public works project has gained increasing attention. Zhejiang is an agricultural area, and agricultural water conservancy is of paramount importance for production and construction. Our association paid attention to the repair of water conservancy projects and the dredging of large and small rivers at the beginning of the drought last summer. Even now, after reflecting on the pain, it is not too late to mend the fold. The main rivers and ponds are related to transportation and water conservancy in one or several counties, requiring large-scale construction and huge costs. We should wait until a definitive plan is established before seeking large funds for dredging. However, tributaries and small rivers have been neglected by people, but their benefits for irrigating fields are significant. During this drought, areas near the ponds were able to have some harvest, while areas far from the ponds had severe reductions in harvests, even complete failure, due to shallow and blocked rivers, obstructed water sources, and difficult water lifting. Therefore, dredging local tributaries and small rivers is the most urgent priority for water conservancy. Now that we are preparing for public works, we should take advantage of the low water level in winter and the slack farming season to order all counties to organize and implement them simultaneously. In this severe winter, people are suffering from cold and starvation, and are crying out for food. Winter relief has not been widespread, and public works should not be delayed. There are also concerns that the spring floods will rise, and the farming season will begin, making the work difficult and interfering with farming. The public works project may be suspended, and the starving people will be left to die in ditches. Therefore, we are sending this telegram for your consideration and implementation. The Shanghai All-Zhejiang Association, sincerely.</p>

<h3>A Major Invention in the Field of Healthcare - The Therapeutic Effects of Nutritional Therapy with Hepheling</h3>
<p>Restoring the Natural Function of the Stomach and Intestines</p>
<p>Preventing the Generation of Toxins in the Body - The Latest Invention for Disease Prevention and Longevity</p>
<p>A Comprehensive Blend of Various Natural Tonics</p>
<p>With Lung-Nourishing, Kidney-Nourishing, and Brain-Nourishing Effects</p>
<p>(1) Restoring the Natural Function of the Stomach and Intestines, Preventing the Generation of Toxins in the Body.</p>
<p>Medical science is advancing rapidly. What was right yesterday is wrong today, which is truly astonishing. Dr. Metchnikoff suddenly published a new theory, stating: "We normally have countless bacteria mixed with food entering the intestinal tract, gradually reaching the colon. This is where a large amount of feces accumulates for a long time, which is also a suitable breeding ground for bacteria. Once bacteria reach the colon, they multiply and grow at an alarming rate, causing the feces to ferment and rot, creating many toxins. These toxins are absorbed through the intestinal walls and enter the bloodstream, damaging the cells and tissues throughout the body. This is called self-poisoning, which is a major cause of aging and disease, leading to a reduction in one's lifespan. If the accumulated substances in the colon are regularly cleaned and the reproduction of putrefying bacteria in the intestines is prevented, one can achieve a disease-free and long life." This is Dr. Metchnikoff's theory of longevity. Once we develop stomach and intestinal problems, we experience nausea, vomiting, acid reflux, headaches, intestinal rumbling, diarrhea, constipation, abdominal pain, poor appetite, and physical weakness, leading to fatigue. The condition becomes increasingly severe, eventually causing inflammation of the stomach and intestinal lining, further impairing the digestion of food and reducing the ability to absorb nutrients. In addition, toxins are generated in the intestines and spread throughout the body, greatly weakening the body's natural resistance. As a result, we are vulnerable to external pathogens, making us susceptible to dysentery, cholera, plague, and even lung and kidney diseases. Examining the current treatments for stomach and intestinal diseases, there are many types of medications, but they are all chemical preparations that only temporarily suppress the symptoms and aid digestion. They do not help to promote the original function of the stomach and intestines. Not only do they weaken the stomach and intestines, but they also cause adverse effects. For example, taking antacids can temporarily relieve excessive acidity, but it can also increase stomach weakness. Similarly, taking antidiarrheal drugs can stop diarrhea, but they can also worsen intestinal blockage and harmful substances, causing vomiting and bloating. In short, traditional stomach and intestinal medications do not address the root cause of the problem, nor do they have the power to restore the weakened stomach and intestinal cells, nor can they enhance digestive function and absorption. The latest invention, Hepheling, can turn a weakened stomach and intestines into a healthy one, restoring its natural function, providing sufficient digestive capacity, and significantly improving absorption. This is a function not found in ordinary over-the-counter medications. Moreover, Hepheling's effects keep the intestinal tract clean, promoting daily bowel movements, preventing intestinal decay, and eliminating all molds or harmful substances in the body, clearing away various symptoms like dissipating clouds. Even chronic diseases of decades can be cured, rapidly increasing appetite and weight. This is truly amazing. More than that, Hepheling is a biological preparation made from a combination of various nutrients that are incomparable to ordinary foods or nutrients. Therefore, its nutrients do not need to be digested and can be directly absorbed into the body, quickly restoring the overall weakness of the body to its former health. It is no accident that doctors around the world are using Hepheling for stomach and intestinal diseases to restore the natural function of the stomach and intestines.</p>
<p>(2) A Comprehensive Blend of Various Natural Tonics, With Lung-Nourishing, Kidney-Nourishing, and Brain-Nourishing Effects.</p>
<p>Hepheling unexpectedly ranks first among tuberculosis treatments. The reason it can rapidly restore the loss of appetite, which is most dangerous in lung disease, and other medicines cannot, is because the ingredients contained in Hepheling, such as Gu Gaona Jie and Insulin, amazed Dr. Buas, the French gastrointestinal disease medical saint, who said: "This formula can be called an appetite-stimulating element." This ingredient can promote the secretion of digestive enzymes such as gastric juice, pancreatic juice, and bile, and enhance the absorption power of the stomach and intestines. At the same time, it cooperates with other ingredients to contribute to blood formation, increasing the ability of white blood cells to dissolve and kill tuberculosis bacteria, and increasing the production of antitoxins, resulting in a decrease in fever, night sweats, coughing, and hemoptysis. For this reason, the patient's appetite can be rapidly restored, to the point where they cannot wait for the next meal. On one hand, because the activity of the stomach and intestines is lively and visible, the food consumed is completely digested and absorbed. Tuberculosis consumes the body's energy extremely quickly, so patients with tuberculosis tend to overeat or be picky eaters to compensate for the deficiency. As a result, they easily damage their stomach and intestines. But at this time, if you take Hepheling, it is because there are various nutrients in a fine-grained state in it, and the amount is very large, such as various vitamins, enzymes, phosphorus, iron, carbohydrates, proteins, fats, and other essential components that make up the body's cells, which are directly supplied to the whole body without the need for stomach and intestines. In this way, patients can restore their former physical strength and turn weakness into strength. As a result, even the incurable tuberculosis can be cured fundamentally, which is a natural result. This is also what Dr. Fruemmel, a German expert in natural therapy for lung disease, advocates for new nutritional therapy. Generally, the decline in our energy is not only due to the weakness of one organ or tissue, but mostly due to the weakness of the whole body's Qi and blood, and insufficient vitality. Therefore, if you want to strengthen your energy, you must first seek the health of the whole body. If you use Rouxiangbin or aphrodisiacs that stimulate the nerves, wait for false yang to develop, and do too many things, the harm is not far from that of smoking addiction, and it will destroy health. However, Hepheling is a supplement of valuable nutrients, such as vitamins, enzymes, phosphorus, iron, carbohydrates, insulin, etc. It nourishes the function of the whole body and restores the strength of youth. Moreover, the vitality element, Guligaojianshi, in Hepheling's ingredients accounts for one-two-point-three-two percent of the total ingredients, which is even richer. Therefore, taking Hepheling can supplement its vitality element, making the general symptoms of fatigue and steaming suddenly disappear and become excited. However, this is not a temporary excitement like an injection, but the synergistic effect of vitality and other effective ingredients, and the effect becomes greater and greater over time. Hepheling contains the brain and nerve nutrient Lecithin, which is an organic phosphate. Taking Hepheling attaches vitality to the brain and nerve tissues, so students, teachers, office workers, bankers, researchers, and other mentally fatigued people must take this medicine, and the motor function of the nerves will become more sensitive than usual. Hepheling specializes in the treatment of various stomach and intestinal diseases, aging, diabetes, nephritis, constipation, and opium and morphine poisoning. It has incredible effects on energy loss, insufficient milk secretion, weakness, and skin diseases in infants and young children, and it also has significant effects on aging, gynecology, weakness, and other diseases.

<h3>Joint Petition to the Central Government by Five Exchanges to Request Exemption from Exchange Tax</h3>
<p>Narrating Business Difficulties and Requesting Postponement</p>
<p>Issuing a Joint Declaration and Seeking Assistance from the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Da Gong News Agency reports that the Ministry of Finance has decided to start collecting exchange tax from February 1st. The gold industry and other five exchanges in this city, burdened by the increased cost and its impact on business, have unanimously resolved to strive against it. Yesterday, they sent a special telegram to the central government requesting exemption and issued a joint declaration, also sending a letter to the city's Chamber of Commerce for assistance. The contents of the telegrams are transcribed below:</p>
<h3>Telegram to the Central Government</h3>
<p>Respectfully submitted to Chairman Lin of the National Government, Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, President Wang of the Executive Yuan, President Sun of the Legislative Yuan, Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance, and Minister Chen of the Ministry of Industry: We, the associations, previously heard of the proposed collection of transaction tax by the esteemed Yuan and Ministry and submitted a petition, laying out the merchants' difficult business situation. Now reading in the newspaper that the tax item will be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review, we are deeply alarmed. Taxation is the duty of the citizens, and the merchants of our associations dare not lag behind. However, with the current market depression, financial exhaustion, and national industry and commerce on the verge of bankruptcy, it is truly impossible to bear. We must again present to the esteemed Yuan and Ministry the actual situation of our associations' business difficulties, as well as the interests of the entire economy. Throughout the years, our country has suffered from internal and external troubles, and the recent water and drought disasters have further aggravated the situation. The people's vitality has been greatly damaged. Coupled with the economic aggression of European and American powers, as well as our eastern neighbor, the outflow of silver, the decline in prices, the closure of shops, the unemployment of workers, the bankruptcy of rural areas, and the decline of cities are all recorded in newspapers. All these phenomena indicate the shaking of the entire economy and the hidden crisis of the future. Although our government has made every effort to manage and provide relief, due to the deep weakness, like a long-ill person, it is difficult to recover even with daily ginseng. Therefore, although prevention work is thorough, the severe situation has not diminished. At this critical moment, the national industry and commerce are all breathing their last, struggling to survive. The merchants of our associations are in the same situation. How can they be an exception? If transaction tax is levied again, burdening the entrustees, it would be no different from strangling a dying person. Moreover, the adverse effects will not only affect the business of our associations, pushing them into a dead end with no way to survive, but also directly eliminate the function of the exchange in the economic sphere, leading to a de facto standstill. Indirectly, it would be tantamount to a fatal blow to the entire industry and commerce of our country. Furthermore, after the stagnation of the exchange, foreigners will inevitably have the opportunity to control our industry and commerce. The activity of foreign merchants' exchanges in the past may even resume today. In that case, the effect of taxation will not be seen, and the economic crisis will break out. What could be more urgent than this? As a result, the government's goal of collecting new taxes may not be achieved, and the original business tax revenue will also disappear. This is not what our government initially expected, nor is it the intention to cherish industry and commerce. Our associations dare not deliberately make alarmist remarks to sensationalize. We do so because of a sense of impending danger and cannot remain silent. Therefore, we respectfully submit another telegram explaining the reasons why we cannot bear the transaction tax, earnestly requesting the esteemed Yuan and Ministry to discern the subtle points and approve the postponement of the tax bill to cultivate the national strength and maintain the overall situation. This would be a great virtue. We await your orders with extreme anxiety and fear. Respectfully submitted, Shanghai Chinese Cotton Cloth Exchange Brokers Association Representative Bian Futang, Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange Brokers Association Representative Wang Zhengruo, Shanghai Gold Exchange Brokers Association Representative Zhan Liansheng, Shanghai Flour Exchange Brokers Association Representative Zhang Weiyun, Shanghai Grain Exchange Brokers Association Representative Xue Chengzhang, together with reverence, Xiao Yin.</p>
<h3>Letter to the City Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>Respected Sirs, the establishment of formal exchanges in our country began after 1918. After the turmoil of the 1920s, the foundation gradually became solid. After more than ten years of painstaking management, it has become the current situation, fulfilling its functions of forming prices, transferring risks, and circulating materials. Now, our government is collecting transaction tax on exchanges. The issue is not whether the legal intention is correct. In fact, under the current situation of the business community in our country today, the implementation of transaction tax must take into account the associated malpractices. Once transaction tax is collected, if brokers, for their own benefit, do not pass on the burden to the entrustees but raise the commission fee for trading, they will only endure the burden for a while and maintain the original commission rate. The malpractices above are all very serious. For example, if the commission fee for trading is raised, the direct result will inevitably affect the reduction of all transactions. The exchange will inevitably fall into a state of stagnation because of this, which will inevitably make the depressed business situation more dull, and the stagnant materials will be more difficult to activate. Then the business tax originally paid by the exchange based on profit will also be greatly reduced, which will harm the income of the national treasury. This is a matter of concern. If transaction tax is also collected on the trading of public bonds (exempt in Japan), the result in the future will inevitably lead to the stagnation of old debts, and it will be even more difficult to issue new debts. This is a matter of concern. If there is more hindrance to exchange trading, there will be more difficulty in the transfer of enterprise stocks. Thus, established enterprises will be difficult to develop, and unborn enterprises will be difficult to produce. This is a matter of concern. The loss of brokers will inevitably affect the survival of the exchange over time. Unfortunately, if foreign exchanges that are not subject to our legal control take the opportunity to revive and deliberately disrupt the market, then our country's exchanges will inevitably have to shut down completely, and the prices of our country's goods will not be able to but listen to foreigners. The exchanges that have been fought for over the past ten years will be handed over to others. This is a matter of concern. Therefore, in terms of today's facts, in order to save the depressed business situation, the transaction tax should be temporarily suspended. In recent years, the world economic panic has invaded from the outside, and the scourge of water, drought, bandits, and chaos has besieged from the inside. The phenomenon of rural bankruptcy and fleeing famine has increased day by day. Industry and commerce have declined, and the circulation of materials has become more difficult. China's entire economic activity is deteriorating, and the future crisis is appalling. The economy is so sluggish that its representation in the exchanges is the gradual decline of transactions. Moreover, recently, the financial market in Shanghai has experienced sudden changes from time to time. People are panicked and cannot live in peace. At the end of the lunar year, the number of companies declared closed by the industrial and commercial sectors can be seen in newspapers every day. The end of the lunar year is approaching again. Since the Ministry of Finance's proposal to collect transaction tax, people have panicked, and all transactions have suddenly shrunk. If the transaction tax is collected at this time, the depressed business situation may become increasingly depressed, and the devastated economy will be transformed into panic. If unfortunately it comes to this, the effectiveness of taxation will not be seen, and the economic crisis has already begun, which is contrary to the original intention of taxation. In order to alleviate the current economic crisis and stabilize people's hearts, the transaction tax really needs to be temporarily suspended. Furthermore, the current transaction tax was promulgated in 1927, but it was not implemented because the tax rate at that time was lower than the current tax rate, and the business situation at that time was more prosperous than the current business situation. At that time, it was not implemented due to the request of our associations. Today, the situation of the industrial and commercial sectors is far worse than that at that time. The distance between the two cannot be calculated by miles, and the tax rate has been increased. Moreover, the tax rate proposed by the Ministry of Finance this time seems to be based on one-tenth of the gross commission of the exchange and brokers for the calculation of goods. However, the collection of stamp tax is particularly high. The following table can be used as proof:</p>
<p>Item Category Ministry of Finance Tax Rate Exchange and Broker Gross Commission Ratio</p>
<p>Stamp Tax (per item) 1 jiao 8.41 times and 2</p>
<p>Cotton (per 100 dan) 9 jiao 9 yuan 1/10</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn (per 100 bales) 3.5 yuan 35 yuan 1/10</p>
<p>Flour (per 1000 bags) 7 jiao 7 yuan 1/10</p>
<p>Wheat, Grains, Yellow Beans, Red Beans (per cart) 1.4 yuan 14 yuan 1/10</p>
<p>Soybean Cake (per 1000 jin) 7 jiao 7 yuan 1/10</p>
<p>Soybean Oil (per 100 dan) 7 jiao 7 yuan 1/10</p>
<p>In terms of the ratio of the above tax rates, the stamp tax rate is more than twice that of the gross commission of the exchange and brokers, which is really unreasonable. For example, in terms of valuation of various grains, the tax rate is as high as 6 or 7 ten-thousandths, which is higher than other goods, and is unfair. It is also easier to make the shaky financial market more depressed. In 1927, it was not implemented due to various relationships. Today, in order to maintain the depression of commerce and take care of the difficulties of merchants, the transaction tax should be temporarily suspended. In short, today's collection of transaction tax still has great difficulties in implementation. If it is forcibly implemented, the effectiveness cannot be foreseen, and the danger is imminent. The above-mentioned matters have long been understood by your association. We have always admired your association for protecting the interests of merchants and making every effort. We hereby earnestly request your association to uphold justice and quickly forward it to the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance to revoke the original case of collecting transaction tax in order to maintain the overall situation and relieve merchants' difficulties. We are extremely grateful. This is addressed to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Cotton Cloth Exchange Mu Ouchu, Flour Exchange Wang Yiting, Gold Industry Exchange Xu Fenghui, Grain Exchange Gu Xinyi, Securities Exchange Zhang Weiru, Cotton Cloth Brokers Association Bian Futang, Securities Brokers Association Wang Zhengru, Flour Brokers Association Zhang Weiyun, Gold Industry Brokers Association Zhan Liansheng, Grain Brokers Association Xue Chengzhang, jointly initiated.</p>
<h3>Joint Declaration</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Cloth, Flour, Gold Industry, Securities, and Grain Exchange Brokers Association declares a request for the temporary suspension of the collection of transaction tax. In recent years, the world economic panic has invaded from the outside, and the scourge of water, drought, bandits, and chaos has besieged from the inside. As a result, the phenomenon of rural bankruptcy and fleeing famine has increased day by day. Industry and commerce have declined, and the circulation of materials has become more difficult. China's entire economic activity is deteriorating, and the future crisis is appalling. The economy is so sluggish that its representation in the exchanges is the gradual decline of transactions. If we take the number of flour transactions as an example, it reached about 300 million bags in 1931, and it decreased to 100 million bags in 1932. In 1933, it was less than 100 million bags. In the past three years, it has gradually decreased by two-thirds. In terms of the gold industry, the number of transactions this year is only half of that in 1930. The trading of securities, cotton, and grain is also in the same situation, tending to decline. The business of merchants depends entirely on the amount of transactions. Therefore, the large reduction in the amount of transactions can also indirectly indicate the decline in the business of merchants. (The content of the middle paragraph of the joint declaration is the same as the meaning of the letter to the city chamber of commerce, and the full text is published on the front page of various newspapers, so it is omitted). In short, today's collection of transaction tax still has great difficulties in implementation. If it is forcibly implemented, the effectiveness cannot be foreseen, and the danger is imminent. Our associations are in it, and the feelings are real. We dare not remain silent because of the danger. In addition to submitting separate requests to the Central Political Council, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, and the Ministry of Finance, we will publish the reasons for the request to the society. In order to save the current economic crisis, we hope that the national industrial and commercial sectors will rise up to assist and advocate together. Then the industrial and commercial sectors will be fortunate, and the society will be fortunate. We hereby declare.</p>
<h3>Shi Shouyu Talks About the Situation of Overseas Chinese in Celebes Island</h3>
<p>Mr. Shi Shouyu, a Fujianese overseas Chinese businessman from Celebes Island, Dutch East Indies, returned to China this time to investigate the industry. He arrived in Shanghai from Hong Kong yesterday and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. A reporter from the Guowen News Agency, introduced by Mr. Liu Shimu, went to interview him and inquired about the situation of the islands in Southeast Asia. According to him, the commercial situation in the various parts of Southeast Asia has been declining day by day, and the export of goods has been decreasing day by day. If there is no turning point in a few days, the tragic situation cannot be described in words. Moreover, the situation in the Dutch East Indies is even more dangerous after the failure of the Japanese-Dutch commercial conference. In order to protect their own interests, countries have raised tariffs, making it difficult for foreign goods to enter. For example, the major commodities produced in Celebes Island, such as trepang, coconut, rattan, resin (industrial supplies translated as dianmatou), etc., are all important local products, but there is no market. The natives are bloodless and exhausted, and the resident government is exacting various taxes. The Chinese Ma Yao Tang Longfei family in this island has been taxed by the resident government as much as 200,000 guilders (about 400,000 yuan in national currency) in the past two years. Other families can be inferred. Middle-class families can barely cope, and ordinary families often sell all their property to pay the heavy tax. The incidents of our resident overseas Chinese being robbed and killed by natives in rural areas are often heard. If they move to cities to run businesses, those with weak capital often find that their income cannot offset the heavy taxes of the government, and the result is bankruptcy. Alas, how difficult is the current situation of our overseas Chinese! Many overseas Chinese now want to take the remaining assets and return to their home country to run businesses, but soldiers and bandits are everywhere in the two provinces of Fujian and Guangdong, and there is almost no clean land to live in. Now, overseas Chinese hope that the government of their home country will have a relief plan. I have returned to China this time to investigate the industries in the country in which overseas Chinese can invest, and I plan to report to overseas in the future. I plan to stay in Shanghai for a week and go to the Yangtze River and other places.</p>
<h3>Our Country Will Establish a Large-Scale Production and Sales Company in Chicago</h3>
<p>Because of Winning Awards at the Chicago Exposition</p>
<p>To Develop International Trade</p>
<p>At the exposition held in Chicago on May 26 last year, our country organized the Chicago Expo Association to collect famous products from various provinces and transport them to Chicago for participation. A total of more than 1,000 boxes and more than 800 kinds of products were collected from various provinces. The above-mentioned products were exhibited at the Chicago Expo and priced for sale. Many foreigners bought them. It is understood that all the products, such as silk, tea, paper, lacquerware, and fabrics, were sold out and received many praises. Therefore, Zhang Xianglin, Dong Kunfan, Zhou Guanhong, and other directors in Chicago plan to obtain a market overseas, promote the above-mentioned famous products of our country, and develop our country's international trade. They specially plan to establish a large-scale production and sales company in Chicago. It is said that Zhang Xianglin and others will return to China this time and start planning to proceed. Many leaders in the business community in this city also support this move.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Increasing the Number of Chinese Directors in the French Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The French Consul-General Replied to the Taxpayers' Association Yesterday</p>
<p>The Request Has Been Forwarded to the French Government for Approval</p>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the French Concession repeatedly requested Mr. Du Yuesheng, chairman of the association, to negotiate with Mr. Meyrier, the French Consul-General, on the issue of increasing the number of Chinese directors last year. As a result, Mr. Meyrier agreed in person, but he has not fulfilled it. Therefore, on the 9th of this month, a letter was sent to the French Consul-General requesting the fulfillment of the previous agreement. The association received a reply from the French Consul-General yesterday, which read: "In response to your letter of the 9th of this month regarding the proposed increase in the number of Chinese directors in the French Municipal Council, this matter is quite important and should be forwarded to the French government for review. I have also promised Mr. Du Yuesheng, chairman of your association, that I will forward the true request of your association to the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs. A corresponding reply is hereby given for your information. To the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the French Concession."</p>
<h3>Xu Jianping Talks About the Economic Decline of Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia</h3>
<p>Affected by the Dumping of Japanese Goods</p>
<p>Mr. Xu Jianping, Director of the General Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance, was previously dispatched to Southeast Asia to investigate the economic decline of overseas Chinese in order to provide relief. Mr. Xu returned to Shanghai a few days ago. A reporter from the Central News Agency went to inquire about the results of this investigation yesterday morning. According to Mr. Xu, the overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia used to occupy a superior economic position, but in recent years, they have been declining day by day, far from what they used to be. The reason for this is due to the oppression of the Japanese side. Most of the overseas Chinese living in Southeast Asia are engaged in business. In recent years, Japanese goods have been actively dumped in Southeast Asia, which has greatly affected the overseas Chinese. If this continues, the future will be unimaginable. Therefore, the Ministry of Finance decided to provide relief and first sent me to investigate. Now, the results of the investigation will be compiled and sent to the Ministry of Finance for adoption. The report will be completed within days. As for the future relief measures to be carried out by the Ministry of Finance, it is still to be decided.</p>
<h3>The Machine Association Requests the Temporary Suspension of the Implementation of the Regulations on the Management of Steam Engines in the French Concession</h3>
<p>A Letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the French Concession</p>
<p>The Shanghai Machine Industry National Goods Factory United Association sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association in the French Concession regarding the inspection of factories by the French Works Department, which read: "Respected Sirs, the French Municipal Council promulgated the Regulations on the Management of Steam Engines last year. Since its implementation, the factories in the concession have suffered greatly from the strict regulations, which are difficult to comply with. They have repeatedly sent letters to the association, requesting negotiation. In addition to requesting instructions from the Ministry of Industry and the municipal government, the association submitted it to the members' representative meeting on January 15. The meeting decided to quickly send a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, requesting the French Municipal Council to temporarily suspend the implementation. A special committee will be formed by the association to be responsible for this matter, so that practical suggestions can be made. Your association is the highest authority for Chinese in the French Concession. You must have long known the difficulties in the regulations on the management of steam boilers. We rely on you for upholding justice. Now, we are submitting a copy of the regulations published in the National Goods News of our association (the difficulties are marked in red), requesting you to look into it and quickly send a letter to the Municipal Council, requesting a temporary suspension of the implementation and considering the difficulties of the factories, re-examine the current regulations, so that our association can also make suggestions at ease. Otherwise, cutting feet to fit shoes, the factories will inevitably protest en masse, or stop work and close down, and the chaos will inevitably be out of control."</p>
<h3>Cotton Expensive and Yarn Cheap, the Yarn Association Held a Meeting Yesterday to Discuss</h3>
<p>The National Chinese Yarn Factories United Association held a meeting yesterday afternoon to discuss the fact that the futures trading price of raw cotton has been rising steadily recently, resulting in cheap yarn and expensive cotton, resulting in huge losses. If no relief is sought, all four yarn factories will inevitably collapse. Therefore, all the yarn factories jointly submitted a petition to ban this type of trading, so that the price of yarn and cotton can be balanced, and to save the future of the yarn factories. The meeting was presided over by Chairman Nie Cansheng. After discussing, everyone agreed that the market is declining day by day, and if they do not seek self-rescue, they will not be able to survive. However, the decisions made are internal and difficult to announce to the outside world for a while.</p>
<h3>Statistics on Syphilis Tests for Wet Nurses at the Health Testing Institute</h3>
<p>Also Tested for Tuberculosis and Trachoma Infectivity in Breast Milk</p>
<p>The Shanghai Health Bureau's Health Testing Institute, in view of the fact that wet nurses suffering from hidden diseases have a great impact on the health of infants, previously notified the citizens who employ wet nurses to send them to the institute for blood tests for syphilis. The results of the tests in the past four months are as follows: in September, a total of 60 people were tested, and 6 people were found to have syphilis. In October, a total of 74 people were tested, and 17 people were found to have syphilis. In November, a total of 58 people were tested, and 15 people were found to have syphilis. In December, a total of 65 people were tested, and 21 people were found to have syphilis. In total, 257 wet nurses were tested in the four months, and 59 people were found to have syphilis, accounting for almost more than a quarter. For the safety of infants, all wet nurses who are sent to the institute for blood tests for syphilis can also be tested by the institute for tuberculosis, trachoma, infectivity, skin diseases, and the chemical composition of breast milk at the same time. The fee for each person is 5 yuan, including the blood test.</p>

(2) The case of reorganizing the Xiamen Leprosy Hospital was satisfactory after Mai's investigation. It was decided to organize a committee to discuss it in detail and to elect Mai Yagu, Zhu Shaoping, and Wu Zhijian as members. Then Wu reported on his trip to Japan and the United States to investigate leprosy. He said that he stayed in Japan for about three weeks and visited seven famous leprosy hospitals. All the hospitals were well managed. He stayed in the United States for about three months and gave an average of more than four lectures to various groups every day. The American Leprosy Relief Association is now engaged in raising 5,000 US dollars for the construction of a auditorium for the Shanghai Chinese Leprosy Sanatorium. All other details will be drafted in a report and published in the Leprosy Quarterly, etc. (2) Discussion matters, (1) The drawings of the Chinese Leprosy Sanatorium were provided by Fan Wenzhao</p>
<h3>To Mr. Ding Dizhai</h3>
<p>We have found that on the 28th day of the third month of the lunar calendar in the summer of 1929, Mr. Qiao Xiuting introduced Mr. Ding Yulin and the Zhongxing Company under Shenxiutang to pledge 1,000 yuan of stocks to our place for 1,000 yuan of ocean, stating that it would be returned in six months. It has been overdue for five years, and the principal and interest have not been returned. We do not know where Mr. is now. We hereby solemnly declare that if Mr. comes to Beijing in person or sends a representative to our residence at No. 17 Zhongjie Street, Hepingmen, within one month after seeing the newspaper, we will negotiate the repayment. If it is overdue, the stocks will be freely disposed of to clear the debt. Important Hongjitang Pan Qi</p>

(2) The medical committee member Dr. Ding Huikang is about to go to Europe to study medicine. The plenary session decided to include it in the agenda to express welcome. (3) The position of director left by Mr. Wu when he went to the United States was invited by Mr. Zhu Shaoping and Cheng Lian to be acting. The chief writer of the Leprosy Quarterly was invited by Dr. Lai Douyan to be acting, which was quite virtuous. The plenary session decided to include it in the agenda to express gratitude. (4) The review of the income and expenditure accounts for the previous year was approved by the plenary session, and accountant Chao Jimei was hired to audit it free of charge. There were many other important cases, which cannot be described in detail. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>
<h3>Flower Powder Industry Guild Discusses Trademark Name Issues</h3>
<p>Because it does not conflict with the central government's interpretation</p>
<p>Requesting the Bureau of Social Affairs to approve registration</p>
<p>Chinese social customs often lead to identical store names. This system violates current trends. Recently, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce received instructions from the Executive Yuan, based on Judicial Yuan Interpretation No. 1140 regarding Article 19 of the General Principles for Merchants, stating that within the same city or town, no one may imitate a previously registered trademark to operate the same business, limited to the same city or town. A notice was issued to all trade associations to comply. The Shanghai Flower Powder Industry Guild, because flower powder shops have traditionally used the name "Dai Chunlin" for fifty to sixty years, believes this interpretation will inevitably cause disputes. A meeting of the executive committee was held yesterday at 2:00 PM at the guild's location on Guanyi Street in the city. Xu Furu presided, and Sheng Shiwei recorded the meeting. The chairman reported that the interpretation was related to the "Dai Chunlin" trademark, which our industry has used for decades. Dozens of businesses have registered with the Bureau of Social Affairs simultaneously, but only one has been approved. If this interpretation is mistakenly used as an example, dozens of "Dai Chunlin" trademark businesses will be affected. A public discussion was requested to avoid disputes. Standing committee member Zhao Guohua stated that the interpretation does not apply to our industry. Our industry has used the name "Dai Chunlin" for a long time without registration, so it does not conflict with the interpretation. It was resolved that Xu Furu, Yang Housheng, and Cheng Guichu, three committee members, would explain the situation to the Bureau of Social Affairs and request approval.</p>
<h3>Spring Board Meeting of the Pushan Villa</h3>
<p>The Pushan Villa, which handles the burial of the exposed and provides medical treatment and medicine at the hospital, is commended by local people for its good deeds related to public health and poverty relief. The spring board meeting was held at 5:00 PM the day before yesterday at the office on Six Malu. Attendees included Director-General Wang Yiting, as well as directors Huang Hanzhi, Wang Xiaolai, Li Shoushan, Luo Kunxiang, Chen Liangyu, Shi Gengyin, Wu Zhiping, Lu Weiyong, Wang Junsheng, and others. After performing the customary rituals, Wang Yiting was elected chairman. Director Wang Junsheng reported on the approximate income and expenditure accounts and work achievements for the 23rd year, noting that the villa has no designated funds and relies entirely on donations from all sectors to maintain operations. The budget for this year requires 50,000 yuan to carry out various projects. Besides the donations of approximately 15,000 yuan from Chinese and Western benefactors, there is still a shortfall of over 30,000 yuan, with no clear source, posing significant difficulties. They should figure out how to raise the money urgently. Subsequently, directors Chen Liangyu and Wu Zhiping expressed their opinions, stating that the matter is complex and the funds are short, which is indeed the reality. For the sake of charitable deeds, a fundraising committee should be organized to facilitate progress. Wang Xiaolai, Huang Hanzhi, Yuan Ludeng, Li Shoushan, Gu Jisheng, Luo Kunxiang, Wu Shuren, Shi Gengyin, and Chen Liangyu were nominated as committee members to jointly support the charitable cause. The chairman put it to a vote, and it was unanimously approved. The meeting adjourned at 7:00 PM.</p>
<h3>Merkley Company Accused of Imitating Huayang Products</h3>
<p>Huayang Factory, located in Wufengli, Laoxue Father Road, produces the famous "Huisi" fruit candies, known for their excellent quality and widely praised by the public. The Merkley Candy Company was found to be imitating the candy and selling it on the market. Huayang discovered evidence, and the French Concession police filed a public lawsuit in the Second Court. The initial trial resulted in a prison sentence and a fine. Merkley appealed, and the case was heard in the Second Criminal Court yesterday at 2:00 PM. Because Zhang Ruqin's grounds for appeal were insufficient, the original bail was maintained, and the hearing was adjourned to a later date.</p>

<h3>Three More Shops Liquidated Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Huachang Materials Firm</h3>

<p>Huangxing Toy Store, located at the entrance of the City God Temple in this city, was founded by Huang A'gen and has been in business for quite some time. Initially, it was profitable, but recently, due to the impact of the decline of various industries, it could not be sustained. This morning, lawyer Peng Qixiu was appointed to represent the declaration of liquidation. The announcement states, "According to the aforementioned party, due to the current economic recession, the commercial market is sluggish, and finance is tight, making it difficult to maintain operations. Therefore, we have appointed a representative to handle the liquidation.

<h3>Lawyer Zhu Sifu Requests Severe Punishment for Ke Yinghao</h3>
<p>If it is proven that he has become a Japanese citizen</p>
<p>Then he should be sent to the Japanese Consulate for punishment</p>
<p>Lawyer Zhu Sifu, representing Liu Yide's rental property, has accused Fujian native Ke Yinghao of owing more than 1,000 yuan in rent for No. 5, Pingle Lane, Xizang Road. On the 10th of this month, when Judge Luo Chongtai of the First Special District Court heard the case in Civil Court No. 7, Ke claimed to be a Japanese citizen and not under jurisdiction. Lawyer Zhu immediately requested the court to order Ke to produce his certificate of renunciation of Chinese nationality, according to the Nationality Law. This angered Ke, who wanted to assault Lawyer Zhu. Court officers stopped him, preventing an unfortunate incident. Details were reported in this newspaper on the 11th. Lawyer Zhu believes that this kind of incident is not only an insult to an individual but also a contempt of court. If he is not severely punished, how can national law be upheld? Therefore, he submitted a report to the Lawyers Association, requesting that it be forwarded to the First Special District Court, requesting that Ke be severely punished. The report was sent to the Lawyers Association yesterday. The original text is recorded below: Regarding the report, Liu Yide, a representative of a member, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the First Special District Court against Ke Yinghao, a Fujian native residing at No. 5, Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, for owing more than 1,000 yuan in rent. When Judge Luo Chongtai of the First Special District Court summoned him to Civil Court No. 7 on the 10th of this month, the member representative, the plaintiff, appeared in court, and Ke Yinghao also appeared in court. He stated that he was originally from Shanghang County, Fujian Province, and that in the 8th year of the Republic (1919), a Mr. Ji from the Japanese Consulate in Shanghai applied to the Ministry of Interior of our country for renunciation of his Chinese nationality. In the 9th year of the Republic (1920), he officially became a Japanese citizen. Therefore, he is not under the jurisdiction of our national court, and he submitted a Japanese citizenship certificate as proof. At that time, the member immediately based on Article 11 of the Nationality Law, which states that the renunciation of nationality by the people must have a certificate of renunciation of nationality from the Ministry of Interior of our country to be valid. Ke Yinghao only submitted a certificate of naturalization but not a certificate of renunciation, so he cannot be recognized as a Japanese citizen according to law. Unexpectedly, at this time, Ke stepped down from the defendant's box and strode back and forth in front of the judge's seat. Although the judge stopped him, it was to no avail, and he even transferred his anger to the member, raising his fist to strike the member. Fortunately, he was stopped by court officials, avoiding assault. However, Ke Yinghao spoke in the Min dialect and insulted and cursed the member, saying that he had to beat him. At that time, he was menacing. Judge Luo then announced that the case would be adjourned to investigate his nationality with the Ministry of Interior and adjourned the court. Ke was still unwilling and waited outside the court, wanting to get the member. After being informed, the member stated this situation to the court at that time. To avoid his attack, he had to temporarily avoid him in the court. After a long time, Ke left the court. This is the situation at that time. The lawyer only knows to represent the party in litigation according to law. If the defendant has any defense, he can make a legitimate statement to the court based on legal principles. He cannot transfer his anger to the agent lawyer. Now, Ke Yinghao relies on being a Japanese citizen and dares to act arbitrarily in the dignified court, even attempting to beat the member in court. Regardless of nationality, the order of the court should be strictly observed. If there is a violation, the judge can place him in custody and send him to the consulate for investigation. Moreover, it is difficult to prove whether Ke Yinghao has indeed become a Japanese citizen before the Ministry of Interior replies. Now he is so violent. If he is formally a Japanese citizen, I don't know how violent he will be. Ke's behavior is not only an insult to the member but also damages the prestige of our country's courts. Insulting the member is a small matter, and disrespecting the dignity of the national court is a big matter. If he is not severely punished, then this kind of incident will inevitably follow one after another. It must be urgently reported. Therefore, we request your association to forward it to the Procuratorate of the First Special District Court to investigate it quickly and detain Ke Yinghao. If the reply from the Ministry of Interior arrives in the future and proves that he has indeed renounced his nationality, he will be sent to the Japanese Consulate for punishment. If it is found that he is not a Japanese citizen, then he will be severely punished according to law to uphold the law and warn others. This is presented to the Executive Supervisory Committee of the Shanghai Lawyers Association.</p>
<h3>Verdict in Tang Jishan's Lawsuit Against Zhang Damin</h3>
<p>Zhang Damin Not Guilty</p>
<p>Tang Jishan, the manager of the Huacha Company, had a love affair with the movie star Zhang Zhiyun, and they lived together. After a considerable period, their feelings gradually cooled, and they ended in resentment. They went their separate ways and developed new paths. As the saying goes, "Where there is life, there is hope." Zhang later lived with lawyer Zhou Xiaobo, as well as Lai Gang and others who served as head of the Fifth District. However, they all broke up soon after. Tang was not willing to be lonely, and he was fortunate to become engaged to Miss Ruan Lingyu, Zhang Damin's fiancée. Ruan was as famous as Zhang Zhiyun in the film industry, so Tang was even more pleased. He decided to marry Ruan. Ruan broke off the cohabitation relationship with Zhang Damin and formally served Tang. Recently, Zhang Damin, believing that Ruan had taken away property when she left, entrusted lawyer Sun Biwu to file a lawsuit. Lawyer Sun first sent a letter to Tang Jishan with warnings. Tang believed that the statements in the letter were not true, so he hired lawyer Xiong Fei to file a lawsuit against Zhang Damin for damaging his reputation. The First Special District Court summoned both parties for questioning and concluded the hearing. Yesterday afternoon was the date for the verdict. Only Lawyer Xiong represented the plaintiff. The defendant, Zhang Damin, surrendered with his defense lawyer, Hong Shihao. At 2:30 PM, Judge Ye took the stand and declared Zhang Damin not guilty. However, since the newspapers published the trial of this case, the outside world mistakenly believed that Ruan Lingyu would also be present. Therefore, many people went to the court yesterday afternoon to see Ruan's beauty. In fact, Ruan was never involved in the swirl.</p>

<h3>Party Headquarters Sends a Letter to the Bureau of Public Works, Asking Not to Approve Five-Story Lofts</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau recently received a letter from the Executive Committee of the Municipal Party Headquarters, according to the report submitted by the 26th Branch of the Fourth District of the Association. It was found that most of the residential buildings in the city are one story with a basement, with kitchens, pavilions and drying platforms. Most of the second landlords, in order to reduce their burden, have built two-story lofts, a total of two-story lofts upstairs, and a total of four floors including the pavilion, which are rented to three tenants. There are few houses and many people, which is extremely detrimental to health and public morals. More greedy people built five-story shacks on the drying platform with only air circulation. As a result, they had to hang laundry along the street to dry. This port is a major commercial port, and the world is concerned. The people's lives are enough to represent the whole country. This phenomenon hinders the international image and does not conform to the new life items. It should be strictly banned to rectify the appearance of the city. If you are not careful, a fire will easily spread. Once there is a fire, nothing will be left. For the above reasons, this is to request the superior agency to send a letter to the Bureau of Public Works, and it should not be allowed to repair the five-story lofts that have already been built, so as to allow them to disappear naturally. As for the houses that have not been built or are newly built, no more licenses will be issued in the future to maintain the appearance and avoid danger. A separate letter will be sent to the Municipal Public Security Bureau to notify all the subordinate staff of the situation.</p>
<h3>The Security Council's Notice to All Subordinates to Intensify Patrols as the Closing Date Approaches</h3>
<p>The Municipal Security Council believes that it is the closing period of various industries, so it specifically appointed Deputy Chen Ce, Manager Wu Chuiying, Staff Xie Shouquan, etc., four people in turn to examine the 16 district groups, starting last night. Yesterday, the association instructed each regiment: It is found that this city is commercially prosperous. During each closing period, there are often movements to carry funds, which are coveted by bandits, resulting in robbery incidents. Our security regiment protects the local area and has a reputation. The past winter defenses have been particularly effective. This year, the city's situation is not good, the silver is extremely tight, and there are more petty thieves. This association, in order to maintain its past reputation and benefit the merchants, has previously ordered the implementation of winter defense in the case. Now it is near the closing date, and it is again ordered that the regiment in the area intensify the deployment of defenses to prevent accidents. In addition to the association sending personnel from this week onwards to the team to check attendance at any time, the regiment headquarters and units should also send personnel to inspect from time to time to ensure thoroughness. In addition to the separate order, the regiment in the area is ordered to forward the information to all subordinates to comply with, which is extremely important. This order,</p>
<h3>All Sectors Enthusiastically Donate Clothing, Bedding, and Rice to the Shelter</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Charity Organization Federation, in accordance with the Social Bureau's request to collect 300 sets of cotton clothing and bedding to be sent to the Garrison Headquarters for distribution to people arrested for serious drug offenses, distributed a request to various charity organizations to collect cotton clothes and trousers. There were 200 sets from the Shanghai Charity Organization in the city, 50 sets from Jishenghui, 10 sets each from Guangyitang Weizhongtang, 10 sets from Lianyi Charity Association, and 10 cotton quilts. However, now that the Command has purchased them on its own, there is no need to raise more. Therefore, the day before yesterday, the donors were notified that the Shanghai Songhu Garrison Command has issued a letter requesting donations of cotton clothing and bedding for prisoners arrested for serious drug offenses. The Association has sent letters to various charitable organizations to collect donations. The letter from the Society (Tang) (Group) included a certain number of cotton clothes (a certain number of quilts), which are being compiled and sent to the Bureau. Now we have received a letter from the Social Affairs Bureau, saying that the Command has purchased these clothes and bedding on its own and there is no need to raise more. There are now many poor people in the Shelter, who are in great need of the cotton clothes and quilts donated by the Society (Tang) (Group). The Association will hand it over to the Institute for application. In addition to waiting for the end of the Shelter, it will be entered into the credit record, and a special letter will be sent first, hoping to check and know it. Since its establishment, the Shelter has received donations of clothes, rice, and other items from all sectors. The Red Cross Society has donated rice twice, a total of 200 bags, Shen Yeqi donated 1 stone of white rice, Zhang Hengdetang donated 40 cotton quilts, Fang Mengfang donated 40 sets of new cotton clothes and trousers, Renji Charity Hall donated 20 sets of new cotton clothes, Chunhetang donated 3 cotton quilts, also Tongren donated 10 dozen gauze shirts, Chunshentang donated 16 cotton clothes, 3 cotton quilts, 1 cotton blanket, Lianyi Charity Association donated 1200 bottles of security water.

The weather is suddenly cold, and the number of adoptions is increasing. The honor place donates 600 cotton clothes and trousers to rescue the poor people. The enthusiasm is admirable. Now, the receipt has been sent to the staff to receive it, hoping that the inspection will be in order.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Congestion of Postal Parcels</h3>
<p>Customs Inspection Takes Time</p>
<p>The other day, the newspaper reported that the people of the city felt that the post office and postal parcels were very congested, and it took a lot of time to send the parcels out, which caused complaints. They planned to ask the post office to find a way to improve it. The reporter from the Central News Agency inquired about the post office. According to the person in charge, the postal authorities have ordered the Shanghai Postal Administration to find a way to improve it as soon as possible to facilitate it. However, the reason for the congestion is that the customs has exempted the parcels sent and received by the post office from transshipment tax, so the number of pieces has increased sharply. However, although the transshipment tax is exempted, the customs inspection procedures are still the same, and they must be inspected one by one, resulting in backlog congestion. The people who send the parcels have to wait for a long time and misunderstandings occur.</p>
<h3>Assassination in a Tram</h3>
<p>Chief Detective Zhou Honglin Shot</p>
<p>The Murderer Fired a Gun Separated by the Doors of the First and Third Classes</p>
<p>Zhou Honglin, a native of Yancheng, 34 years old, lived in Jinyuanli, Datong Road, Avenue Edward VII, Public Concession. He served as a detective in the Criminal Investigation Department of the Fuzhou Road Police Station for several years. He was very serious in his work, so he was trusted by his superiors. Zhou never prepared a car to go home after work. He must take the Public Concession's Route 16 or Route 19 trolleybus. Yesterday afternoon at 12:00 p.m., Zhou took Route 16 trolleybus No. 300 to return home for lunch after finishing his official business. On the way, he happened to meet Detective Xu Zhenting of the Xinzha Police Station and Chinese policeman Zhang Shaobo of the Jiaxing Road Police Station, who also took the same bus to return home. Since they knew each other, they greeted each other briefly and chatted side by side. When the bus arrived at the Enterprise Company station at No. 517, Avenue Edward VII, more than a dozen passengers got off the bus, and at the same time two or three passengers got on the bus, so it was very crowded. When the bus got off, there were only one or two passengers left. When the conductor was about to ring the bell to start the bus and close the door, two male passengers in the third-class seat, one wearing a yellow gown and the other wearing an overcoat, suddenly got off the bus in a hurry. The conductor thought that they had missed the station, so he reopened the door for them. Unexpectedly, in a short time, the man wearing the overcoat took out a box gun and fired two shots at Zhou Honglin from across the glass door between the first and third classes. The glass was pierced with two holes, and the bullets hit Zhou's head and waist. Immediately, blood flowed like a waterfall, and he fell in the car. The murderer, seeing that the goal had been achieved, jumped off the trolleybus and fled. At that time, Xu Zhenting and Zhang Shaobo witnessed this situation, so they ordered the bus to stop immediately and drew their guns to chase down. Seeing that the murderers had turned into Jinjiazhai and fled, they hurried up, but the alley was intricate and they escaped. Xu and others rushed to the Xinzha Police Station to report. They immediately called an ambulance to rush Zhou to the Public Works Bureau Hospital for treatment. Because the injuries were in key areas, the situation was very critical. They also unloaded the glass that had been shot through and brought it back to the police station for research, and asked the passengers who witnessed it in detail about the appearance of the murderer and sent out a strict search.</p>
<h3>British Woman's Drug Manufacturing Case</h3>
<p>Her Husband Johnson Has Already Left for Shanghai</p>
<p>The Trial of the Defendant Has Been Postponed and Bail Granted</p>
<p>According to the Zilin Bao, the case of an English woman residing at No. 361, Fahua Road, the wife of Englishman Johnson, being accused of violating the ban and manufacturing narcotics at her residence, was heard again by the British Consulate Court on Wednesday morning and afternoon. The defendant was still defended by lawyer L克斯. Lawyer 白郎 applied on behalf of the defendant to postpone the trial to await the return of the defendant's husband Johnson from England, and produced two telegrams proving that Johnson would soon set off to return to Shanghai and was expected to arrive in port in early April. The case was then postponed to next Wednesday for continuation of the trial, and the defendant was still granted bail. Yesterday, Mr. Walker, a chemist from the Public Health Department of the Public Works Bureau, went to court to submit 14 kinds of samples obtained from the defendant's residence and a report, proving that except for one kind of E, the rest were heroin products. Subsequently, West Detective Du En陈述陈述 the beginning and end of the case, and said that in 1934, Johnson and his wife both made a living from the funds given by the charity. Last December, the defendant and her husband bought a car, first paying 800 yuan in cash, and the remaining money was paid in monthly installments of 255 yuan. One installment had been paid, and 4,000 yuan was still owed. The furniture in the residence was purchased from a Chinese furniture store, priced at 1,760 yuan. 300 yuan was paid in cash, and the remaining money was paid in monthly installments of 300 yuan, which had not yet been paid. It was also proved that before November 1934, the defendant and her husband had lived in various boarding houses, all of which owed several months' rent.</p>
<h3>Cessation of Trial Proceedings; Release of Lu Xihou and Others on Bail</h3>
<p>The Judge Views Lu's Progress in Clearing Debts</p>
<p>As a Reference for Adjudicating the Accusation Against Him</p>
<p>Following the collapse of the Banque Industrielle de Chine, the Legal Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council considered the bank's Chairman, Lu Xihou, the Deputy Manager, Lu Mengxiang, and the Manager of the Xinhua Trading Company, Sun Xiren, to be jointly involved in fraud. It therefore brought a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, alleging incomplete records in the bank's account books. Important officers of the bank, Wan Weijian and Zhou Shaopeng, etc., were also prosecuted under company law in the same case. The First Special District Court has conducted several hearings. These matters have been detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday morning, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, opened the criminal court to continue the hearing. Tao Youxin, the British accountant engaged by the police to investigate the accounts, also appeared in court. Judge Qian questioned Tao about the doubts in his report and ordered him to swear an oath of responsibility, stating that the facts in the report were true. He also inquired of Lu Xihou about the Wang Guozhi mortgage incident. Immediately afterward, he proceeded to hear the portions of the case against the defendants accused of violating company regulations. Only the defendant Zhou Shaopeng appeared in court; the others were absent. The police lawyer, Ru Bao Yi, stated the reasons for the prosecution, announcing that the charges against the absent defendants would be withdrawn, and requesting that those present be judged according to the law. Lu Xihou's lawyers, Wu Lin Kun and Fan Gang, briefly stated the facts. Judge Qian then instructed Lu Xihou that the presiding judge could independently judge whether he was guilty or innocent according to the law. However, if found guilty, he would definitely not settle his debts, and if found innocent, he would be even less willing to do so. Therefore, in order to protect the interests of the creditors, the trial was suspended to observe his progress in clearing his debts, as a reference for the judgment. The court ruled that the trial proceedings regarding Lu Xihou, Sun Xiren, and Lu Mengxiang be suspended. Lu Xihou was allowed to be released from custody upon payment of 20,000 yuan in cash and 30,000 yuan in surety bonds. However, if the judge deemed it necessary to detain him during the liquidation process, he could still be detained. The court also issued judgments on the parts of the case concerning the defendants accused under company law. Zhou Shaopeng and Wan Weijian were both found not guilty. The cases against Chen Jikan, Xiang Xiang, Wu Lihua, Feng Weiqin, Lu Ruizheng, Wang Qi, Lu Xifan, and Wang Jixuan were not accepted.</p>

<h3>Extortion Under False Pretense of Court's Name is Urgent</h3>
<p>Zhao Yongliang and He Shouming Are Extremely Despicable</p>
<p>Police Arrest and Prosecute After Disturbance in Front of the Court</p>
<p>Zhou Fugen, a local resident residing at No. 3 Ruyi Lane, Lan Weiai Road, in the French Concession, was found to have supplied handguns and shared the spoils in a robbery case. Detectives Wang Rusong and Liu Jinrong of the French police learned of this. First, the robbers were apprehended and based on their confessions, Zhou and his wife, Wang (26 years old this year), were arrested by the police on October 30th of last year and sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. On November 9th, the police formally filed a public prosecution. During the trial, it was found that there was no suspicion of criminal activity on the part of Zhou and Wang, and they were released in court without prosecution. Zhou Fugen was prosecuted for the crime of illegally possessing military weapons, and the trial concluded on November 26th with a fine of 300 yuan. However, after Zhou Wang was released, she went around seeking people to help her find ways to reduce her husband's sentence. At that time, Zhao Yongliang, a Nanjing native, 28 years old this year, residing at No. 1 Liangyi Lane, Dafang Lane, in the Chinese district, and He Shouming (also known as Hu Bin, 35 years old this year, from Nanjing, residing at No. 5 Songshou Lane, Xin Zha Road, who previously worked as a dispatcher in the Second Special District Court Detention Center and was dismissed for cause, and has been idle lately), were two people who usually lingered in front of the Second Special District Court, soliciting bail, soliciting lawsuits, and swindling. Zhao and He were acquainted with Liu Kezhong, Zhou Wang's sub-landlord. Through Liu's introduction, they met Zhou Wang. Zhao and He then bragged that they knew various judges in the court and could help with lobbying, and could guarantee a reduced sentence, but required a fee of 500 yuan. Zhou Wang vaguely agreed. After the court's judgment, Zhou Fugen was fined, believing that they had voluntarily done so, and demanded a reward of 500 yuan from Zhou Wang. Because of her difficult circumstances and the fact that her husband was imprisoned, she could not afford it and asked for a delay. Zhao and He were impatient, and on November 29th, they urged Zhou Wang to issue a note, and because she was a woman and could not make decisions, they asked her to invite a man to the scene. Zhou had no choice but to invite her father, Zhou Guanyun (56 years old, who runs a rattan chair shop in Tilanqiao) to the scene, and after Wang's repeated requests, the amount was reduced by 100 yuan, and Zhou Guanyun issued a promissory note for 400 yuan, accruing interest according to the code, and to be delivered in ten days. When the time came, Zhao and He again urged Zhou Wang to pay, and she promised to wait until her husband was released to raise the money. Unexpectedly, Zhao and others forced Zhou Wang to sell her furniture to pay off the debt, limiting the time to do so and then dispersed. On the 14th of this month, at noon, Zhou Wang brought clothes and food to the Second Special District Court Detention Center to visit her husband. She met Zhao and He in front of the court, and they again urged her to pay, surrounding her and forcing her to sell her furniture to pay immediately. At this point, Zhou Wang could not delay any longer and started an argument. After the argument, she reported to the French police, accusing Zhao and He of intimidation and extortion. The police chief then sent detectives Wang Rusong, Zhang Daorong, and Wang Dongwan to the front of the Second Special District Court to arrest Zhao and He. Evidence of fraud was found on them: a list of names of judges and prosecutors from the Second Special District Court, the Primary and Local Courts, and the Third Branch Court, as well as clerks, a business card of the police lawyer, a promissory note issued by Zhou Guanyun, and many miscellaneous notes. After questioning by the police chief, they were ordered to be detained. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District Court. The police lawyer, Yuan Jiahuang, stated the case and requested a postponement in order to conduct a detailed investigation and file a lawsuit for trial, and presented the seized evidence. Zhou Wang and Zhou Guanyun then testified about the previous situation. After the judge examined the presented evidence and various notes, he was greatly angered by the fact that the two defendants falsely used the names of court judges and prosecutors to swindle money. After separate interrogations, both defendants made evasive remarks, denying that they had falsely used names to deceive, claiming that the plaintiff had asked people to find bail for her husband, and that the promissory note was a guarantee for the bail, not extortion. After reviewing the confessions in court, the court ordered a postponement of the hearing to the 26th of this month, and the defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Receipt Issued by Kidnappers in the Zhang Zhongyu Kidnapping Case</h3>
<p>One Hundred Yuan Already Paid to the Kidnappers</p>
<p>The Ransom Amount Has Not Been Agreed Upon</p>
<p>Zhang Yangge, the four-year-old son of Zhang Zhongyu, a silk merchant from Shaoxing residing at No. 10 Senchang Lane, Kunming Road, was kidnapped on December 12th of last year at 1:00 PM. On the previous day, the kidnappers, Shi Yushu from Ningbo, Shi Wenmao from Shaoxing, and He Rencheng from Ningbo, were arrested in Room 321 of the Far East Hotel on Xizang Road by Lu Liankui, the Chinese superintendent of the Shanghai Municipal Police, and detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, and Yu Chengying. Based on Shi's confession, detectives Shen Tianbao and Chen Yaoting were instructed to go to No. 9 Guangxing Lane, Wuchang Road, to rescue the hostage Zhang Yangge, and a Shaoxing woman, Wei Wang, who was guarding the hostage, was arrested. Then, at Shi Yushu's home at No. 665 Beile Road in the French Concession, Shi's wife, Lin, Shi's daughter, Aju, the maid, Li Yang, and Shi's friend, Wang Caiqing, were arrested, and a Mauser pistol with the number 93928 was confiscated. These individuals were detained separately. These matters were detailed in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday morning, the police sent the captured criminals to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. The police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, explained the circumstances of the arrest, stating that after the plaintiff's son was kidnapped, the kidnappers sent three letters to the plaintiff, demanding a ransom of 50,000 yuan. The plaintiff sent people to contact the kidnappers four times, but the amount was too large and could not be agreed upon. However, the plaintiff paid the kidnappers 100 yuan, for which the kidnappers issued a receipt. The police have retrieved the three letters and the receipt. However, the case still requires a thorough investigation, so he requested that all the defendants be detained and a hearing be postponed. Judge Qian Hongye questioned each defendant briefly and ordered that the case be postponed for one week. Li Yang and Shi Aju were allowed to be released on bail, and the rest were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Bank of China Employee Xu Jianhou Arrested for Embezzling Huge Sum</h3>
<p>Confessed to Failed Speculation</p>
<p>Will Be Sent to Court for Handling</p>
<p>Xu Jianhou, a young man from Dantu, 23 years old, formerly residing at Hanyang Village, Connaught Road in the International Settlement, was introduced to the Treasury Department of the Bank of China at No. 10 Bund in the spring of the 22nd year of the Republic of China through the recommendation of a friend who guaranteed him. Unexpectedly, Xu embezzled 22,800 yuan in the treasury last year. When the director of the bank's Treasury Department found out and reported to the manager for investigation, Xu knew things were not good and had already taken the opportunity to escape without a trace. The bank then reported the amount of Xu's embezzlement and his photograph to the police in charge, who were allowed to send officers to investigate and arrest him. The First Special District Court issued an arrest warrant, which was sent to the French Concession and Chinese district police authorities on July 12th of last year for assistance in the arrest. It is now learned that the case was discovered by Wang Shenqing, the squad leader of the stationed detective team of the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Xu Jianhou had recently been hiding on the second floor of the Shen family's residence at No. 2 Baishou Lane, Penglai Road in Nanshi. He reported the case information to Captain Lu Ying for instructions on how to handle it. After receiving the report, Lu ordered squad leader Zhou Peisan to lead detectives Wu Songshan and Xu Changbiao, as well as the original investigator, squad leader Wang, and officers from the Wenmiao Road Police Station in charge, to secretly go to the address at approximately 9:00 AM yesterday to arrest Xu Jianhou. Xu surrendered without a word. The team then notified the bank. Captain Lu then summoned the case for interrogation at approximately 10:00 AM. Xu Jianhou confessed that he had taken this step due to failed speculation. The team believed that the case involved embezzlement and immediately prepared a document to send Xu and his confession to the Third Section of the General Bureau for review in the afternoon. It is heard that Director Huang sent the interrogation section chief to clarify the matter before transferring it to the court for handling according to the law.</p>
<h3>Gao Weixiang's Latest Invention, the Exposure Meter, Already Being Sold Abroad</h3>
<p>Gao Weixiang, a photography expert who studied in Germany and was previously known in the photography community for creating the exposure meter timer, observed that the failure of general photography is attributed to the error in exposure time. Not only do beginners in photography have no grasp of the determination of exposure time, but even those with more experience in photography also find it difficult in particularly difficult situations and in the exchange of new experiences, resulting in wasted money and missed opportunities, which is very regrettable. According to expert investigation, at least 70% of the films have exposure errors. Although there are already various exposure meters to help, it is impossible to find one that is easy to use and accurately calculates. Therefore, he specially researched and developed the only perfect "Zheqin-style exposure meter" based on many years of research on exposure problems. No matter where or when, indoors or outdoors, just move it lightly to get the correct exposure time for taking photos and videos, eliminating the need for thinking or measuring. The results are completely the same as the most accurate photoelectric method, but it is easy to use and low in price, which is not its reach. Various still cameras and movie cameras can be applied. With various charts and explanations, it is very practical. He has already applied for patent rights in various countries. Since its release, it has been printed in various languages ​​and sold to hundreds of thousands at home and abroad. Major photography magazines and photography societies have unanimously praised it as easy to use and accurate in calculation. Its value can be imagined. It is now learned that the Chinese version of the Zheqin-style exposure meter has also been released. It is made of high-quality celluloid and is exquisitely printed, small and exquisite, and easy to carry. The price is 2.5 yuan. It is exclusively managed by Lin Fu Construction Company, No. 54 Nanjing Road in this city. Those who purchase directly from the company before February 15th of this year will be charged 2 yuan per unit, and there will be additional preferential benefits. After the deadline, the price will be charged without discount. Mr. Gao also has other inventions, which will also be released one after another soon.</p>

It is now heard that the newly built Jinhua China Travel Service Hostel has been completed and the opening ceremony will be held on the 19th of this month. At that time, the traffic on the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Road will be heavy, and there will be a grand occasion.</p>

<h3>Robbers Change Clothes After Robbery, Wearing the Victim's Overcoat and Fur Coat</h3>
<p>Both Robbers Have Been Arrested</p>
<p>The residence of Li Yiji at No. 8 Taide Lane, Xujiahui Road, in the French Concession, was suddenly visited by four robbers at 11:00 AM on the previous day.

<h3>Introducing New Book "Talks on the Current Situation of China's Economy"</h3>
<p>The complexity of China's economic organization and the chaos of its current situation make it impossible for the general public to understand. There are few good books on the market that can provide a concise analysis and a simple introduction. The Shen Bao Monthly of the Shen Bao Newspaper, in view of this, specially invited domestic economists to compile the book "Talks on the Current Situation of China's Economy" and listed it as one of the company's series of books. The current situation of China's economy is divided into eight lectures, namely (1) Overview, (2) Finance, (3) Domestic and Foreign Trade, (4) Agriculture, (5) Industry, (6) Transportation, (7) Economic Power of the Great Powers in China, and (8) Way Out. Each lecture uses simple language to make a systematic description. Those who have no economic knowledge at ordinary times can get a clear concept of the entire current situation of China's economy after reading it once. The last lecture, "The Way Out of China's National Economy," is especially wonderful and worthy of Chinese people to ponder. The book was published on the 15th of this month and is priced at six jiao. It is also heard that those who subscribe to the Shen Bao Monthly for the whole year before the end of February will receive a copy as a gift. A coupon for the book is attached to the New Year's issue of the Shen Bao Monthly.</p>

<h3>Peng Xiangying's Speech on the Relationship Between Citizens and Air Defense (Continued)</h3>
<p>Therefore, since we know the terror of fires caused by incendiary bombs and the difficulty of firefighting during air raids, we should organize fire self-defense teams or fire prevention squads in peacetime and enthusiastically engage in training, and strive to purchase firefighting equipment to supplement the shortcomings of the fire brigade in wartime.</p>
<p>Now, let us take the benefits of air defense equipment and organization already in place in Japan, for peacetime, when dealing with the occurrence of disasters, as an example to see that air defense equipment can not only protect our lives and property in wartime but also prevent the spread of our peacetime disasters. Because Japan feels that the air forces of various countries are developed and the range of flight has expanded, it is afraid that its islands of Fusang will be easily attacked by air. From the perspective of its national defense and strategy, it is actively engaged in air defense equipment. In recent years, in its important cities across the country, it has spared no expense to make efforts in various air defense facilities and carry out large-scale air defense exercises. Since it carried out its first air defense exercise in Osaka in Showa 3 (i.e., our Republic of China 17), it followed up with the Nagoya air defense exercise in Showa 4, the Kyushu air defense exercise in Showa 6, and the Tokyo air defense exercise in Showa 8. Last August, it also carried out a large-scale air defense exercise in Osaka. In the meantime, there are still small-scale air defense exercises in various cities, even in its colonies such as Gyeongseong in Korea and Taiwan, which also held air defense exercises. It can be seen that Japan's efforts in air defense are no less than those of other countries in the world. Japan, which has never been attacked by enemy aircraft, is still so concerned about air defense facilities. Shouldn't we, this naked city with unhealed wounds, quickly seek protective facilities? Last July, I wanted to know about the air defense situation in Japan, so I went to Japan to visit the Osaka air defense exercise. Only then did I know that their exercise was prepared for a year and cost hundreds of thousands of dollars. When the exercise took place, the participating troops had the mobilization of four divisions, and the participating people also had more than ten million. In addition to the 1st and 3rd flight regiments, the 7th bombing regiment, and the Akeno Flight School and naval aircraft, newspaper aircraft, transportation company aircraft, etc., about 70 aircraft participated in the exercise. There were also 48 anti-aircraft guns from the 1st anti-aircraft artillery regiment and various field artillery regiments, 28 searchlights and listening devices, and more than 200 anti-aircraft machine guns and anti-aircraft machine guns deployed in the Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe areas to serve as military air defense exercises. There were also six barrage balloons from the Chiba Air Defense Balloon Team raised in the air to prevent enemy aircraft. In addition, the agencies participating in the exercise included the Osaka Railway Bureau, the Nagoya Railway Bureau, the Osaka Communications Bureau, the Nagoya Communications Bureau, the Osaka Customs, the Kobe Customs, and the various agencies and schools under the jurisdiction of the central government, the Ministry of Communications, and the Ministry of Railways in various prefectures, cities, districts, townships, and villages. Almost everyone in the exercise area participated. The most noteworthy thing for us is the protection corps, which bears the heavy responsibility of civil air defense. The protection corps is the only agency for citizens to prevent air raids. It is a group that serves to reduce or avoid damage when enemy aircraft drop bombs, incendiary bombs, and gas bombs. The group is composed of members of the veterans' association, members of the youth corps, students of the youth training institute (such as our country's student army, boy scouts, etc.), firefighters, members of neighborhood self-government associations, medical and health groups, women's groups, etc. The group headquarters is located in the Osaka Municipal Government. According to the 15 districts in the city, each district organizes a district protection corps. Under the district, a protection branch is set up according to each protection area. Under the branch, there are various classes to directly undertake protection duties. The organizational situation of the protection corps is as follows:</p>
<p>Osaka City Protection Corps | District Protection Corps | Protection Branch | ((1) Security Class (2) Alarm Class) (3) Fire Prevention Class (4) Traffic Control Class (5) Shelter Management Class (6) Evacuee Guidance Class (7) Work Class (8) Poison Gas Prevention Class (9) Rescue Class (10) Supply Class (11) Propaganda Class (12) Liaison Class</p>
<p>During this exercise, the Osaka City Protection Corps had a total of 280 branches, totaling 171,500 members. In addition, there were 902 factory protection corps branches, totaling 174,725 people, all organized by male and female workers and staff from various factories in Osaka to be responsible for the protection of factories during air raids. The above totaled nearly 350,000 people, all of whom had received air defense training in peacetime and possessed air defense knowledge and skills, and the organization was very strict. Even if it is not an air defense exercise period, it can be convened at any time to deal with various disasters. For example, last September, when Osaka suffered a major disaster of hurricanes and floods, Osaka achieved a lot of results in the emergency rescue at the time and the post-disaster reconstruction due to the efforts of the protection corps. It is conceivable that if it is such a natural disaster that cannot be prevented, it will be able to exert its ability to achieve the purpose of passive air defense in the face of man-made air raids.</p>
<p>In short, in Osaka City, Japan, there are 300,000 protection corps members organized by citizens. The air defense organization and facilities of other important cities and towns can also be inferred. Here, we not only know that the Japanese people's attention to and enthusiasm for air defense are no less than those of the British and French people, but we also know that air defense equipment and organization are indeed very effective in preventing disasters in peacetime. Now, let us take the Great Kanto Earthquake in Japan as an example to make us know that without air defense equipment and organization, it is impossible to prevent disasters from occurring in peacetime. During the Great Kanto Earthquake, there were 135 fires in Tokyo at the same time. The flames covered the sky, and the prosperous city turned into hell. However, 43 of the fires were extinguished by the citizens at the beginning of the fire. At this time, many houses collapsed in Tokyo, and the streets were blocked. If the citizens did not automatically extinguish these 43 fires and waited for the fire brigade to arrive, the entire Tokyo would be reduced to ashes. However, considering that the citizens of Tokyo at that time did not have a fire organization with the concept of air raids, if it were today, the damage would be reduced even more. Moreover, air raids have air defense warnings that can be transmitted, and the danger can be foreseen in advance, and citizens can have sufficient preparation time. Even if the incendiary bombs dropped are fierce, they cannot all hit the target. If they can be rescued with effort at the time, the damage from the fire can be reduced. Then, under this clear proof, we should quickly engage in air defense facilities and not wait until disaster strikes, digging a well when thirsty, which is too late. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Ministry of Education Plans to Produce Tools for Popularizing Compulsory Education and Mass Education</h3>
<p>Plans to Invite Experts to Develop Simplified Character Chart</p>
<p>And Cast Copper Molds with Phonetic Annotations for Chinese Characters</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education believes that in order to popularize compulsory education and mass education in various provinces and cities, it is necessary to have simple methods and tools to achieve twice the result with half the effort. It has been noted that during the Song and Ming dynasties, many idle people advocated simplified character charts (such as "Liu" written simply as Liu, "Zhang" written simply as Zhang, etc.), which were popular for a while and passed down through the ages, and may be adopted as tools for promoting compulsory education (because simple "Liu" is easier to recognize and write than complex "Liu," and the same for "Zhang," making it easier for elementary school students and the masses to learn). Also, because Chinese characters are numerous and complex, it is planned to produce copper molds with phonetic annotations for Chinese characters (adding phonetic alphabet annotations next to Chinese characters, so that knowing the phonetic symbols can also be used to spell out and recognize difficult Chinese characters) to assist in popularizing compulsory education and mass education. The Ministry of Education therefore plans to realize this and has already sent letters to Li Shaoxi and Wang Yian, members of the National Language Unification Preparatory Committee, asking them to draft a plan for completing the simplified character chart and casting copper molds with phonetic annotations for Chinese characters during the winter vacation and come to Beijing to discuss the matter in order to realize it as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Measures</h3>
<p>Measures for the Trial Implementation of Literacy Education by the Youth Vacation Service Corps During the Winter Vacation. (1) These measures are formulated by this Corps in order to utilize the winter vacation time of the members of this Corps to implement literacy education. (2) Each member should teach at least three illiterate people at home or in the neighborhood so that they can recognize more than 100 commonly used characters (see the attached list of 100 most commonly used single characters). (3) The method of trial implementation of literacy education should be based on the convenience of the person being taught, with door-to-door individual instruction as the principle, and it may also be taught in groups. (4) The trial implementation of literacy education should be based on one hour per day, and each person must have at least ten hours of direct instruction. (5) Before the Corps Headquarters has compiled and issued teaching materials for the trial implementation of literacy education, each member will temporarily adopt their own. It is best to use various mass textbooks or elementary school textbooks as a basis, and string words into sentences according to the single characters listed in the list of 100 most commonly used single characters, and teach them repeatedly. (6) The commonly used characters taught should pay attention to joint application, and the learners should be instructed to practice calligraphy. (7) The trial implementation of literacy education should pay attention to arousing the learners' interest in literacy so that they can continue to study or be admitted to school for instruction (learners in the location of the school will continue to be instructed by the member in their spare time after opening the writing, and learners not in the location of the school should find ways to introduce them to nearby mass schools for instruction in order to achieve complete success). (8) The trial implementation of literacy education should pay attention to persuasion and promote their voluntary instruction, avoiding coercion. (5) The implementation process of the trial implementation of literacy education, and the literacy progress of the learners should have simple records. (10) Corps members with outstanding results in the trial implementation of literacy education will be rewarded at the discretion of the Corps Headquarters after verification.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Branch of the Educational Film Association Continues to Collect Educational Film Fees</h3>
<p>Distributes Letters to Public and Private Schools at All Levels</p>
<p>Collect and Submit Fees for New and Old Students Two Weeks After the Start of the Next Semester</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Educational Film Association, which submitted a request to the Ministry of Education for approval last autumn to collect educational film fees from public and private schools at all levels within the city's borders and store them as the association's fund for development, has, since the first semester of the 23rd year, had the Municipal Education Bureau forward the Ministry's order to all schools to comply with the assistance in collection. Students above the vocational school level are charged one yuan each, secondary school students are charged fifty cents each, and elementary school students are charged twenty cents each. This fee is only paid once by each student during their respective academic programs, and will not be collected again. For example, if a first-year student in primary school pays the fee once, they will not have to pay again until they graduate from sixth grade and enter middle school, at which time they will pay the educational film fee for secondary school students once. Many schools at all levels have complied with the order to collect and submit fees to the association this semester. The association has entrusted the collected funds to the Fund Management Committee for special storage. It is now reported that the association needs to collect fees from schools that have not yet collected this semester, and that the educational film fees for new students entering schools next semester should also be collected as required. Therefore, yesterday, letters were sent to schools at all levels, uniformly requiring them to collect and submit the fees within two weeks after the start of the winter vacation, and to submit them to the Municipal Education Bureau for forwarding to all schools for compliance, in order to increase the collection of funds and facilitate the thorough implementation of the plan.</p>

<h3>News Roundup from Various Schools</h3>
<p>Zhaohe Middle School: Zhaohe Middle School, located at the intersection of Robert Road and Pinlang Road in this city, was originally established with special permission from the Ministry of Education in memory of the Zhaohe warship's uprising. Since its establishment, thanks to the support of the government authorities, the promotion of people from all walks of life, and the cooperation of Principal Jia Botao and all the teachers and students, the school has achieved outstanding results. Furthermore, because the school has always emphasized populism and militarization, the tuition fees are low and the education management is strict. It is reported that there are still a dozen or so vacancies for transfer students in various grades. Entrance examinations will be held at 9:00 AM on January 20 and February 1. Registration will be accepted until the day before the examination date.</p>
<p>Guangzhao Girls' School: Guangzhao Girls' Primary School in North Sichuan Road, Yokohama Bridge, has been in operation for many years and has achieved remarkable results. Currently, there are hundreds of students in various grades. Since Liu Hongwei took over as principal, he has strived to expand the number of students. Therefore, transfer students are being recruited for all grades and kindergartens at the beginning of the spring semester in order to achieve universal education.

<p>Chapter 7: Hearing Words, She Hides Her Tears and Sells Herself to Tell of Hardship; Cautiously Observing, He Asks to Rely on the East with Earnest Affection</p>
<p>"So then, let us proceed with the second step of our plan, to actually seek an audience ourselves. With this spirit and following these steps, I believe we can achieve our goal. To be honest, no matter how high-ranking an official, they are most afraid of us not being able to see their face. If we can see their face, and use the method of encirclement to surround them, we need not fear that they will not give us a position. The difficulty lies in this hurdle of meeting, which is not easily overcome." As he spoke, he raised his hands and shook his head repeatedly, as if to say that he felt somewhat unappreciated for his talents. Li Shilian thought to himself, "The more you say this makes sense, the more I cannot let you get to know Cheng Zhiqian. Otherwise, I would be giving away such a good opportunity to you." So he smiled and said, "What you say might not be correct. However, this Cheng is also extremely shrewd and a bit arrogant, probably not easy to deal with. I don't want to bother with him." Zhang Jiefu snorted in his nose and laughed, "What's the big deal?" When Li Shilian heard him say that he had his own methods, he felt even more displeased, and said faintly, "Then we'll see if there's an opportunity. I'm too lazy to be friends with people of such low status and high temper." Zhang Jiefu's level of experience in society was above that of Li Shilian. How could he not know Li Shilian's unhappy attitude? Following that, he smiled and did not continue the conversation. He let Li Shilian leave, and himself hurried out of the hotel, only returning after about an hour. He saw that Cheng Zhiqian was still in his room and had not gone out. Without even entering his own room, he stood at the door and bowed slightly, saying with a smile, "Mr. Cheng hasn't gone out yet?" Zhiqian said, "Please come in and sit." Zhang Jiefu could not have wished for that more, and immediately walked in. But there was one thing that immediately caught his attention: on the table was a card with eight lines written on it, saying, "Tomorrow at 11:00 AM, please grace me with your presence at the Dalu Spring for a simple meal. Please do not decline. Your humble younger brother, Li Shilian, bows." This was truly a case of "Do not say you travel early, there are those who travel even earlier." However, on Zhang Jiefu's side, the approach would be different. (115)</p>
<h3>Discussion of National Painting</h3>
<p>— Yi Mei</p>
<p>Looking through the history of Chinese painting, it can be said that talent has emerged in abundance. Every era has had several representative works, such as Wu Daozi's Tang paintings, Ma Yuan's Song paintings, Ni Yunlin's Yuan paintings, and Shen Zhou, Tang Yin, Wen Zhengming, and Qiu Ying's Ming paintings, as well as the Four Wangs, Wu Li, and Yun Shouping's Qing paintings. Each has its own style and spirit, so it is no wonder that they can be remembered for a long time as masters of art. Reaching the present day, although shaken by the Western trends, some people have worked hard in the areas of oil painting, charcoal drawing, and watercolor painting, but there are also not a few who are steadfast in their principles and purely pursue Chinese painting. Especially in Shanghai, national painters often hold national painting exhibitions, both collaborative and individual. Although superficially, these exhibitions are meant to give people an understanding and appreciation of national painting, in reality, they are mostly due to supply exceeding demand, with no patrons for the works. Therefore, they have no choice but to hold exhibitions here and there, selling paintings and offering framing, and engaging in major publicity. As a result, they often gain very little and instead lose money on expenses and advertising fees. As a result, the future of national painting seems to be covered by a gray curtain, with no light to be seen. Some say that painting and calligraphy are luxuries for the wealthy. Since the market is not prosperous and the countryside is bankrupt, people are struggling to make a living, so where would they have spare money to buy paintings and calligraphy to hang up? This is certainly very reasonable, but on closer thought, there are other reasons. In the past, people used paintings to represent personality. Entering a room with famous artists' transcendent works on all four walls, one could imagine the elegant and refined character of the owner. Moreover, when carrying a folding fan with the signature of a famous painter, others would know that you were a person of great importance and would not dare to deceive or humiliate you, saving you much trouble. Nowadays, the social atmosphere has changed drastically, with money being the prerequisite everywhere. There is no talk of personality, let alone any distinction between elegance and vulgarity, so naturally there is no need to use paintings to represent anything. Furthermore, paintings are used as decorations. Now, houses are trending towards Westernization. Hanging a Chinese painting in a Westernized house seems out of place. Especially recently, all architecture and arrangements have favored the Cubist style, with simplicity and cleanliness being considered beautiful, a complete reversal of the previous elaborate decorations, so paintings are naturally relegated to the list of things to be eliminated. Therefore, judging from this trend, national painting is getting worse and worse and has reached its end. I fear that there will be no more days of flourishing and great development. I know a very famous old painter. Once, a young man admired his wonderful painting skills and asked someone to introduce him, wishing to become his disciple. The old painter asked the introducer: "Does this young man have any assets at home? What are his expectations for the future after he learns?" The introducer said: "His family is poor and he plans to make a living by painting." The old painter replied very bluntly, "In that case, it is better to advise the young man to learn some other business that has more hope. If he follows me, he will inevitably starve to death in the future. Don't delay his future." How painful were the old painter's words! Alas!</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Wu Xiongjian)</p>
<p>"One mouth, two pieces of skin, turning it over and over, it's always him!" This saying is really true. For example, if a poor person goes to a banquet and gorges himself, someone next to him will say, "He looks like he hasn't eaten in several lifetimes, just like he's grabbing medicine rice." If he is restrained and cautious, someone else will say, "This kind of person has never been to a decent gathering, just looking at him is enough to make me full!"</p>
<h3>Records of Faint Fragrance of Imperial Incense</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>After that, we went back to a small informal hall in the center, and the Empress Dowager was ready to go back to her seat to rest: suddenly, she saw a very lively wooden horse standing alone in a not very bright corner. Its size and height were exactly the same as a real horse, and its four legs seemed to be deeply planted in the bricks and soil as if they were growing out of it. On its back, there was also a complete saddle, with countless shiny metal nail heads nailed to the saddle. | Perhaps they were originally nailed with jewels, but were later replaced. | At first, she seemed very surprised, then hurried over to examine it carefully, slowly nodding her head to show that she already understood: but we still couldn't figure out its purpose, and Guangxu remained lazy and paid no attention at all. So the Empress Dowager's chatterbox opened again.</p>
<p>"The most indispensable skills for a hunter are archery and horsemanship. We have already seen the learning of archery; now, this wooden horse is specially provided for practicing horsemanship! Because the most important and most difficult thing to learn in horsemanship is the speed and agility of mounting a horse. For example, if we encounter a wild animal and shoot it with one or two arrows, it has already fallen to the ground and seems to be dead. We have to ride over to take a look, but it is still lying motionless. So we always think that we can dismount to skin it or tie it up and take it away: unexpectedly, as soon as we dismount, it jumps up again. At this time, we must use the most skilled posture to jump onto the horse, otherwise, we will fall into its trick and lose our lives. Therefore, many of our past leaders often came here to use this wooden horse to practice the posture of mounting a horse: often they would practice continuously for several hours, sweating all over before they were willing to rest.

<h3>Goods from Afar</h3>
<p>— Zhang Huang</p>
<p>During the year of promoting national goods for women, the fashionable women in the cities invariably regarded high-heeled leather shoes made of goods from afar as the starting point of fashion. They are accustomed to it and do not find it strange, which is really strange! Take my cousin, who has long been recognized as the most knowledgeable among the female relatives, but she has not been able to escape this custom. A pair of high-heeled leather shoes is always on her feet. She said: "I am very willing to promote national goods, but the annoying thing is that the sound of these high-heeled leather shoes making a creaking sound when walking seems to be tempting, making me feel that without wearing them, I don't even have any energy. Even if I want to persuade others to use national goods, I can't speak up. I can only decide on my own that under the condition that I personally use all national goods, I will retain the matter of these high-heeled leather shoes."</p>
<p>One day, she invited me to accompany her to a leather shoe store opened by a Westerner to buy shoes, because she knew that one of her friends had recently bought satisfactory goods in this store. She thought that buying foreign goods would be cheaper. I thought that it would not be bad to accompany her to see the situation in a Western store. So four feet (I mean two people) walked into this shoe store full of exotic flavor.</p>
<p>There were five or six Westerners and one or two Chinese in the shoe store. I guessed that the Chinese would definitely be the ones to greet us when we Chinese came to patronize, | the so-called "birds of a feather flock together." Unexpectedly, a young Westerner rushed forward, and opened his mouth in English to say please sit down. Then, as if he had realized the inappropriateness of conversing with us in English while we hesitated to answer, he switched to a half-baked Chinese Mandarin to carry out his business procedures. He very quickly took out a pair of new-style leather shoes, and after looking at my cousin's foot size, he sat on a low stool to try them on for her, asking diligently if they were comfortable. According to her, they were really comfortable on her feet. When asked about the price, it was five dollars, which was indeed the lowest price. Such a pair of new-style leather shoes is on the market in Shanghai.</p>
<p>Of course, my cousin did not make any harsh objections to this price; but this unusually low price led her to suspect sloppiness in the workmanship, so she raised this question to this goods-from-afar clerk.</p>
<p>The goods-from-afar clerk's smiling and excited reply seemed to have anticipated this move. He said, "Please see, such sturdy and new-style workmanship is extremely trustworthy, because all the goods in our store are made by machines. One person manages the machine and produces hundreds of pairs a day, replacing the manual labor of several people, who can only produce a few pairs a day, so naturally the value is undoubtedly low."</p>
<p>A clear explanation immediately concluded the transaction. When we took the new shoes and went out, I saw a smug look of victory on the face of the goods-from-afar clerk, which seemed to be a source of pride for the industrial development of his country. But in my feelings, I only felt that this person who had traveled across the ocean to make a living had his livelihood taken away by huge machines and was still unaware of it, which was somewhat pitiful. Compared with the Chinese people's donation of money to increase the wealth and power of foreign countries, and their willingness to indulge in current vanity and enjoyment, it was only a matter of fifty steps compared to a hundred steps, wasn't it?</p>
<h3>Recovery of Light</h3>
<p>— Yue</p>
<p>Short story</p>
<h3>Wrinkles on Yang Ershu's Forehead</h3>
<p>— Die Yi</p>
<p>Uncle Yang Er, in the west street of Minghuang Town, could be considered the only well-to-do family. He had more than fifty acres of land, which was quite a lot in the countryside.</p>
<p>Every morning, Uncle Yang Er picked up his tile teapot and went to the teahouse in Zhongjie Street. After washing his face, he drank strong tea. The tea leaves were of the best Wuyi variety, which Uncle Yang Er provided himself. At the same time, he slowly cracked watermelon seeds. He was often the most eloquent person in the entire teahouse, and he was always so happy.</p>
<p>However, unfortunate luck gradually befell Uncle Yang Er! One year, he encountered troops passing through, and Uncle Yang Er was busy assigning everything he was responsible for supplying, which caused Uncle Yang Er to feel a heavy loss.</p>
<p>This year, the fields did have a good harvest, but unexpectedly the price of grain was very low, and the income was much worse than in previous years.</p>
<p>Following that, there were two years of flooding, and all the rice in the fields was drowned! The following year, there was a major drought, and the fields became cracked turtle shells, and there was no harvest at all.</p>
<p>Originally, relying on raising silkworms in the spring and summer seasons, he could earn dozens of dollars, but due to the depression of the silk industry, no silkworm cocoon shops were open, and there was no way to sell the cocoons, which was another major impact.</p>
<p>And more unfortunately, Yang Er's wife suffered from a very severe red-eye disease for more than three months. In addition to seeking medical treatment and taking medicine, she also sought secret prescriptions and made vows to Guanyin Temple, spending more than sixty dollars before ensuring that Yang Er's wife's eyes did not go blind and gradually regained their sight.</p>
<p>Under such repeated difficulties year after year, the money that Uncle Yang Er had accumulated through years of hard work was not only used up, but he also incurred a lot of debt.</p>
<p>As a result, in the teahouse on Zhongjie Street, it was rare to hear Uncle Yang Er's strong voice of conversation!</p>
<p>Soon, Uncle Yang Er's second son was about to marry a wife, and his second daughter was also about to get married. Although in such a famine year, everything could be simpler, the furniture in the son's new house and the daughter's dowry had to be prepared, which would cost a lot of money.</p>
<p>Uncle Yang Er thought about selling his water buffalo, but in such a year, everyone was planning the same thing as Uncle Yang Er, so who would buy his cow?</p>
<p>In the end, Uncle Yang Er had no choice but to sell a portion of his own land to others to solve the immediate difficulties.</p>
<p>In previous years, each acre of land could be worth at least two hundred dollars, but now no one wants it even for fifty dollars an acre. Uncle Yang Er finally entrusted someone and ran around himself several times, spending countless words, before he finally reached an agreement with Shao, the owner of the pharmacy in East Street. Six acres of land were valued at two hundred and fifty yuan. After signing the contract, Uncle Yang Er's six acres of land changed hands.</p>
<p>Out of the two hundred and fifty dollars, a portion was used to pay off debts that could no longer be delayed, and there was not much left. Uncle Yang Er worried every day about how to live in the days to come?</p>
<p>Originally, Uncle Yang Er had a very strong body and a radiant face, but now he often gets sick, and several deep wrinkles have appeared on his forehead!</p>

<h3>On Tea-Drinking Literature</h3>
<p>— Zai Qing</p>
<p>Tea-drinking is an "elegant matter," but the privilege of this elegant matter belongs to "mountain men" and "famous scholars." Therefore, since ancient times, those who have discussed this matter most vigorously and reliably belong to this group. As for country bumpkins and peddlers, even if they are tired, they have to run into a small teahouse to drink some tea, which is just for rest and thirst quenching. There is no "tasting" or "elegance" involved. As for tea pickers, they basically have no good tea to drink. Being able to keep some "tea crumbs" and "tea stems" to enjoy with themselves and their neighbors is already something that ordinary people in the tea region do not have.</p>
<p>However, mountain men and famous scholars not only want to drink good tea, but also want to write poems about drinking tea and engrave exquisite collections of "tea-drinking literature." After Lu Yu's "The Classic of Tea," we have many books on drinking tea. I once saw a Ming Dynasty edition of "Tea Collection" which collected essays and poems about drinking tea since the Tang Dynasty. Before the book, there were also two pages of "Boiling Spring Picture" engraved by Tang Bohu, as well as inscriptions by many famous literary figures of the time. Drinking tea also requires good spring water, as can be imagined from the title of this "Boiling Spring Picture." Therefore, famous scholars who were particular about drinking tea at that time hired special ships to transport spring water from Huishan from afar, which is often seen in classics. Although Qiu Changru caused the "tea tasters" to be embarrassed once by mistaking river water for famous spring water and making a bit of a joke.</p>
<p>Zhong Bokjing wrote a "Collecting Rain Poem" with a short preface saying: "It has been raining continuously for days and nights, and there is no spring. Collecting it to brew the tea, the color and fragrance can rival Huiquan. The method is to use white cloth, five or six feet square, tie its four corners, and press it with a stone in the center to collect water from all directions, and place it in a jar in the courtyard to receive it. Those who avoid lightning dislike its impurity. All night long, I worry about the water not arriving, and then I no longer know the hardship of rain. Replacing annoyance with joy is also a way to change the environment with the mind." In helplessness, he actually came up with such a method to collect rain instead of famous spring water. For the sake of drinking tea, the painstaking effort can be generally seen; Zhang Zongzi sitting in Min Laozi's house, not leaving until he had drunk his famous tea, and only spending a day, what did that count for?</p>
<p>Also, the reason why Ran Dian loves to drink tea is good for comparison. The reason for loving tea is the same as "loving a beautiful woman." Enjoying oneself is also decorating oneself. I remember when Ximen Qing fell in love with Gui Jie, when he first invited guests to her house, Ying Bojue, seeing Ximen Qing's lust, once teased him with a "tea poem" in the tune of "Chao Tianzi" when serving tea. The poem said, "The tender buds of this fine tea grow in the spring breeze. If you don't pick or pluck them, the leaves will be residue. But boiling them gives them a great color. The exquisite quality is hard to describe or paint. I sip it often in the daytime, thinking of it when I'm drunk, and loving it when I wake up. Originally, a basket of it is worth a thousand gold." Comparing tea to a beautiful woman illustrates their consistent understanding of the two, although there are considerable differences between them.</p>
<p>However, drinking tea ultimately has prerequisite conditions, which is a stable life. Zhang Dafu was one of the best at drinking tea. In his "Complete Works" and "Pen Talks," if the articles on drinking tea were separated, they could also be printed into a book. Perhaps no one has researched drinking tea more deeply than him. However, while he was studying drinking tea, his wife actually came to bother him, saying that there was no rice in the kitchen, forcing him to put down the important matter of drinking tea and go to find money to buy rice and cook, and to express a sigh.</p>
<p>I bought a Japanese remnant book "Recent Words" from a cold stall at the City God Temple, which was written even more interestingly. It said: "A mountain monk loved tea, and a woodcutter passed by every day, and the monk always served him tea. The woodcutter said: "What virtue does tea have that the master loves it so much?" The monk said: "Drinking tea has three benefits, one is to aid digestion, two is to dispel sleep, and three is to reduce desires." The woodcutter said: "What the master calls the three benefits are all not for the benefit of the little man. The little man cuts firewood to provide food, and eats bean porridge and coarse food. If he loves digestive things, he is bound to be hungry. I move when it is light, and rest when it is dark, and sleep soundly, not waking until dawn, and the pleasure of a king facing south cannot surpass it. If he loves things that dispel sleep, he is bound to be hard-working. The little man has a wife who can share poverty with the little man, for the pleasure of sleeping together. If he loves things that reduce desires, he will make his wife unable to endure poverty. Therefore, all three are not for the benefit of the little man, and I dare to refuse." It can be seen that drinking tea is not a "pure blessing" that everyone can enjoy, except for those high-ranking officials and nobles, and mountain men and famous scholars.</p>
<p>Among the new literati, there is no shortage of people who talk about drinking tea and write tea-drinking literature. First, there was the poet Xu Zhimo, who died in "the wind does not know which way to blow," and later there was Sun Fuxi, who did the tea-drinking literature movement and ran a tea-drinking magazine. However, Xu the poet's "On Drinking Tea" has become a lost manuscript in his complete works, and Sun the painter's magazine also seems to have not continued for a long time. The best group left is probably only Zhou Zuoren, the master of the bitter tea hermitage, who says "let's go to my humble house to drink bitter tea." Zhou Zuoren started "drinking tea" from the "Rainy Day Book" era (1925) to the publication of "Watching Clouds Collection" (1933), and he was still "drinking tea," but when he was "fifty years old" (1934), he designated people to "drink bitter tea." Drinking tea to the point of drinking bitter tea, the high degree of his tea drinking is knowable, and the inevitability of his drinking tea is also knowable. However, we cannot but admire that the continuous domestic and foreign artillery fire has not smashed Zhou Zuoren's tea hermitage, teapot, and teacup. The life of a special class is so stable.</p>
<p>Eight or nine years ago, Ryunosuke Akutagawa visited Shanghai, and he satirized the "tea drinkers" on the Nine-Bend Bridge; During the Li Hongzhang era, foreigners also had the prediction that "seeing the Chinese people's 'drinking tea,' one can see that this country is hopeless." However, now, even in terms of the intellectual class, there are not only those who "entrust their grief to bitter tea," but also those who are tired of Chinese tea and advocate drinking foreign tea. This truly cannot but make people have a Kang Youwei-style sigh: "Alas"! I want to say nothing!</p>
<h3>The Sound of Selling Cakes</h3>
<p>— Ma Xingye</p>
<p>What makes people feel the saddest at night, in the past few months, was the weak sound of the passing geese. In winter, the sound of geese is no longer heard much. Every night, when you are not asleep or not sleeping deeply, you will always hear the sound of selling cakes in the alley. The neighbors often play cards, sometimes until dawn, so the cake seller knows that there are good customers here, and at three or four o'clock in the middle of the night, he still sings weakly about selling cakes, and the sound is full of sad emotions.</p>
<p>Recently, I have spent more time in the library, and my brain is tired, so my sleep has become abnormal. My school doctor once told me that if you run a mile or two desperately before going to bed, you will fall asleep and not know the dawn. I have tried it in the past, and it has worked, but after arriving in Nanjing, where can you run like a madman? The roads are full of mud, the alleys are full of coal gas, and walking around in the house interferes with the sleep of the friends downstairs.</p>
<p>I am afraid to hear and love to hear the sound of the cake seller, because the sound of the cake seller indicates that the night is very deep, and while many humans are already enjoying their God-given right to sleep, I am unfortunately abandoned. I do not resent it, because he is singing weakly, he is being oppressed by life, and in the cold wind and dew, he is watching the opportunity to sleep pass by. In his opinion, I am considered a relatively happy person. I unconsciously have a nameless feeling of friendship for the cake seller. I often wait with my eyes open for the arrival of this sound. Often I wait for a long time and the sound has not yet penetrated into the alley, and I worry: perhaps he is sick today, or there is a night show, and something dangerous has happened.</p>
<p>Recently, the house has been cleaned very cleanly, my heart is not disturbed, and my brain is not reminiscing, and I am staring alone with my slightly dry eyes, aimlessly looking at the four walls. If the night is not too dark, I can also see many maps on the wall, seriously scowling at me. The fire in the stove is out, and a line of cold wind is drilling into the small holes of the wire window. At this time, there is only one me in the world. I weakly put my body on the bed, and let the bed steadily support my entire weight and the weight of my emptiness. My heart is like still water, like a deep abyss, and the slow and sad sound of selling cakes is like cold wine pouring into fresh water, slowly penetrating in and sinking down.</p>
<p>I often hear the sound of horns in the middle of the night, and I have also heard the sound of ancient temple bells in a state of semi-sleep, but neither is as unforgettable as the sound of the cake seller. A certain Japanese person once wrote an article about the trumpet at night, and recalled many terrors of war from the sound of the trumpet. When I was in middle school, I was very moved when I read that novel, but at that time, I had no experience of insomnia, so I could not appreciate all its wonderfulness. Four or five years ago in Nanjing, I gradually began to understand the meaning of this text. Wen Zhengming of the Ming Dynasty has an essay "Record of the Drum Sound of the Offering Tower," from which he realized the feelings of many unfortunate people in the world. When I went home last summer and stayed quietly for more than twenty days, the Xiantan Temple in the east of the city often rang bells and drums in the middle of the night, so I knew Wen Zhengming's state of mind in those years. Time is gradually sending me, and my ability to understand the state of mind of others is gradually improving. Life is a plum branch, and the branch is full of many joys and sorrows, and these bell sounds, trumpet sounds, and cake-selling sounds can also be regarded as a few small buds on this plum branch.</p>
<p>Huang Zhongze was a talented poet, and his decadence is what I think is most unacceptable, although it is very sympathetic. Among his many clear and beautiful little poems like the cry of a crane on a clear night, I like to read this one: "In the morning, light rain makes it difficult to form a dream, everywhere I hear the selling of maltose by the stream. No wonder the peach blossoms are half fallen, tomorrow will be Qingming in the riverside village." After all, what kind of sound is "maltose flute"; I still don't know, but I can very well understand his state of mind of not being able to sleep on a rainy night, and being surprised that Qingming is coming again. This kind of artistic conception is completely different from that of "listening to the spring rain in a small building all night, selling apricot blossoms in a deep alley tomorrow morning." One is unwilling to see the arrival of Qingming, and the other is very interested in selling apricot blossoms tomorrow, and has warm pleasure.</p>
<p>I don't know if the cake seller will be an old man or a young man. If he is a young man, his voice will at least carry the sorrow of an adult. I don't know when he can go to sleep. I myself will always fall asleep groggily at five or four o'clock. During the day, when I am already sitting in the library, or leaning against the fire by the stove, I don't know where the cake seller is. I hope he can get a sweet sleep.</p>
<h3>Random Notes from Guizhou (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>Passing Lou Mountain Pass</p>
<p>In a small, damp house, five or six lamps could be lit, filling the air with swirling smoke:</p>
<p>"One basin isn't enough today. We'll have to sell our strength later!"</p>
<p>"Let's split another basin, huh? Crossing Lou Mountain Pass, three ups and three downs, is tough enough."</p>
<p>This small house doesn't need any "Do Not Discuss State Affairs" notices. Although their words are all disordered, even facts from the past decade and fantasies about the next few years flow casually from their mouths, "state affairs" are irrelevant to them. They don't care who is feuding with whom, or who is celebrating with whom. These things are like external matters that have nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>"Not hurrying yet? The sun's halfway up the sky! This bunch of turtles!" The foreman searched anxiously along the long street of the village, from east to west.</p>
<p>Like a whirlpool of rushing water, people rushed towards the center from different openings.</p>
<p>"Put in some extra effort to get through the pass today, and we'll have a good meal at the inn tonight. (Note)" The foreman smiled, offering them some encouraging comfort.</p>
<p>We set off, a mighty group, advancing along this long mountain road.</p>
<p>On the road, you could also see passing travelers. At least, you could see many donkeys carrying goods. Without access to foreign ships or trains, everything needed to rely on their physical strength to transport daily necessities.</p>
<p>Besides lodging and having a quick meal, stopping along the mountain road was also important. Large stations were ten to fifteen li apart, and small stations were three to five li apart. The distances weren't very accurate, but those who traveled the route frequently could estimate where to eat and where to rest. Once these places were decided, there were very few stops at other stations.</p>
<p>The natural scenery in the mountain hollows was quite lovely: dense trees, beautiful green mountains, clear streams, terraced fields, and the endless, bumpy roads all slipped away beneath our feet, slipped away. However, "mountains seem to run away as you approach." Lou Mountain Pass, which didn't seem far away, actually took more than three hours to reach.</p>
<p>We had another quick meal and ate a little more food. Then, we started to climb the mountain pass. Lou Mountain wasn't that high, but the stone steps were quite steep, causing the travelers' legs to ache and their strength to weaken.</p>
<p>The second peak was higher, and the last one was the highest. Usually, there are some flat stretches between two mountains, but Lou Mountain Pass had continuous ups and downs, leaving the weary body no chance to recover. Perhaps this was why it was considered so difficult?</p>
<p>With great difficulty, we climbed to the final summit. Involuntarily, we all took a deep breath and sat down. The sun was already setting.</p>
<p>The foreman's face was smiling, and he was humming:</p>
<p>Lou Mountain is high and deep,</p>
<p>Shoulders carry heavy loads, so heavy,</p>
<p>Three ups and three downs, eighteen li,</p>
<p>Clothes soaked with sweat, exhausting.</p>
<p>Note: Sedan chair, a mode of transportation in Guizhou. Tarpaulin, a waterproof cloth that must be placed on top of the sedan chair to prevent rain. A good meal, meaning a treat.</p>
<h3>Abandoned Woman</h3>
<p>— Written by 丨丨Maud Jousey Fangel</p>
<h3>The Human World (3)</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>This time, without my friend answering me, I knew where we were because as soon as I entered the room, I smelled a strong odor of opium. What else could this be but an opium den? But opium dens should be located on busy streets to attract customers. How could they have business hidden in a dark alley? The few opium dens I saw on Zhengyang Street were not only brightly decorated with brilliant lights, but they also had people standing at the door soliciting business. As you passed by, they would say to you:</p>
<p>"Original raw opium, original product; take a puff, it's really better."</p>
<p>Or:</p>
<p>"The opium tastes good, no other place can compare; the bubbles are big, smoking costs half the price."</p>
<p>Since this place was an opium den, why didn't my friend say so? Could there be some unspeakable secret hidden in this?</p>
<p>We first walked into a dark hall, and then into a small room to the right of the hall. My friend walked through the dark room as if he knew it better than the dark roads in the alleys, as if it were his own home. In the darkness, I saw a kang (brick bed) by the window. My guide grabbed something on the kang in the darkness, and immediately a shrill female cry came out. Only then did I realize that there was a woman lying on the kang. The woman then spoke:</p>
<p>"Is it Cao, Master? What, did your wife at home let you off the leash?"</p>
<p>This sentence contained a strong hint of sarcasm, but it was said so bluntly that anyone could guess the woman's identity.</p>
<p>A small kerosene lamp, about the size of a bean, was lit by the young girl who had followed us into the room. I carefully looked around the room: it was an opium den, no doubt about it – the five or six opium trays placed on the kang were the most powerful evidence. This woman, about twenty-four or twenty-five years old, looked unkempt and feisty, clearly a female rogue, and an opium addict. In short, she was someone who mattered.</p>
<p>My friend spoke:</p>
<p>"What's the point of saying that? What do you mean, 'let me off the leash'? If you didn't want me to stay every day, you wouldn't have kept me."</p>
<p>Saying such words was indeed a bit harsh, but saying them to a woman of her status could not be considered an insult. On the contrary, she wanted you to say some similar things to her so that she could be happy. As expected, after hearing my friend's words, she cried even more and said:</p>
<p>"As long as you have dollars, you can stay for ten or fifteen days at your leisure."</p>
<p>This place is an opium den, a private opium den, and at the same time it is also a private brothel.</p>
<p>I completely understood this place.</p>
<p>"Okay, talking idle talk is useless. I'll introduce you to a customer," my friend pinched her face and said. "This is my friend Li Weixing, director of a certain section of the police department; this is," he pointed to her with a smile, "this is my lover, my lover Hao Xiaolan."</p>
<p>Correction: In the article "The Anti-Mountain Humanistic Literature of the Late Ming Dynasty" published the other day, Xue Gang hated Shanren (mountain man) so much that he changed "Shanren" to "Shanjī" (mountain chicken), which was mistakenly printed as "Shanzá" (mountain mongrel). We hereby correct this error.</p>

<h3>Financial and Gold Markets Remain Unstable</h3>
<p>Rebound After a Fall, Recovering 3.7 Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was filled with uncertainty and hesitation. Initially, it fell due to the strengthening of the foreign exchange market. However, positive news and intervention from the central bank stimulated buying, eventually pushing the price above 70 yuan. The buying frenzy was intense. In the morning, the overseas silver market was stable in both the UK and the US, but brokers predicted that the US would rise after the market closed, and the forward silver price in Montréal actually fell. Foreign exchange rates generally rebounded. London spot gold fell 10 pence. Premarket trading opened and quickly dropped to 67.8 yuan, then rose to 68.9 yuan. The central bank's official exchange rates were announced, with the British rate unchanged and the US rate up 0.0625. The customs gold unit fell 0.012. The standard gold price retreated to 988.7 yuan, then weakened slightly after that. The supply of gold continued to surge after the opening, causing the price to continue to fall, but there was strong support to maintain the price at the lower level. The market was generally stable, allowing for some upward movement. However, major players continued to sell aggressively. The central bank supplied spot silver, and Sassoon sold forward silver, which kept downward pressure on the market. Banks seized the opportunity to buy at cheap prices, and the foreign exchange market potentially tightened. Buyers became active in the market, gradually pushing the price back up. The silver balance tax was announced, but there were no changes. At this time, the HSBC bought forward silver, tightening the foreign exchange market, and the price rose above 9 yuan. After the high, suppliers tried to balance the market, struggling slightly. However, major players sold off in droves, making it difficult to avoid a decline. However, the overall trend was stable, and there was strong support to maintain the price at the lower level. Major players also bought after selling. Although there were some rebounds, trading in the market was sluggish, and the trend remained mediocre, hovering around 8 yuan. The market became more stable at noon. In the afternoon, the foreign exchange market continued to strengthen, and sellers continued to surge and fall. However, due to the slight reduction in the printing of silver, there were many buying orders after the low. When the central bank intervened with spot gold, and the Associated Press in Nanjing reported positive news for the buying side, the price rebounded. However, it continued to fluctuate. Later, as market sentiment turned positive, the foreign exchange market tightened, and the central bank continued to intervene with spot silver, pushing the price above 70 yuan. Although there were some setbacks due to major players taking profits, eager buying and rumors favorable to the buying side fueled the market. The closing price was very strong. The overall trend for the day was uncertain, and the market was jittery. Overnight interbank lending rates fell to 0.15 yuan. Swap premiums also fell to around 7 yuan.

When Dingchang vigorously bought bars, retail investors and Fuxingyong, Yongli, and others all bought, rising to 8.6 yuan. Retail investors sold out, retreating to 7.8 yuan. The silver balance tax was announced, but there were no changes. At this moment, the situation was stable. However, because Dehua sold June silver at 5.625 to HSBC, the market was bullish. The news that the central bank continued to ship cash for export caused Yuanchangyong, Tongtaichang, and others to buy, rising to 9.4 yuan. Dafayong, Changda, Dayuan, Maoyong, Xiangfeng, and Fuyu sold off, retreating to around 7 yuan. However, because Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, Dafayong, and others maintained support, the market was very stable. Fuyu sold and then bought, finally rebounding to 8.4 yuan. Yuanyi and Dingkang continued to sell at the high price, falling to 7.5 yuan. After fluctuating, the market closed at noon at 968 yuan. The market continued to stabilize after the close.</p>
<p>The market opened in the afternoon at 968.1 yuan, quickly rising to 8.5 yuan. Dadecheng, Yuli, Fuxingyong, Shengda, Qianchangxiang, and Hengxing came to sell. Mitsui sold February US dollars at 5.625. Dongfang sold February silver at 5 pence, falling to 5.6 yuan. The initial telegraph report on the reduction of silver printing was 1.11 anna. Fuchang and Fuxingyong advanced to 6.5 yuan. Hengxing and Yuankangxiang sold to 5.7 yuan. Fuyu and Fuxingyong again advanced to 6.5 yuan. However, the domestic market strengthened, and Zhaofengchang and Dadecheng still sold to 5.5 yuan. The second silver printing report came back unchanged, and market sentiment stabilized. Yuansheng and Hengyu sold, but due to rumors of the central bank intervening with spot silver, and an Associated Press telegram stating that a high-ranking leader in Nanjing said that inflating the currency could not cure China's economic ills, but that a remedy must be found, Fuxingyong, Yuanyong, Dingtangsheng, Daheng, and Hongxingyong advanced to 8.3 yuan. Yicheng, Chunyuan, Fuxingyong, Yuanheng, and Fuyu took profits at the high, retreating to 7 yuan. Dadecheng and Yuankangxiang came to buy, and rumors of the central bank intervening with spot silver spread, rising to over 70 yuan.

By the time the market closed, it had risen to 972.8 yuan. Changda and others bought after the close, rising to over 3 yuan. Wanxing and Fuxingyong supplied bars, retreating to under 3 yuan. Juchang and others vigorously bought, rising to over 3 yuan again. The highest price of the day was 972.8 yuan, and the lowest price was 965.5 yuan, a difference of 7.3 yuan. As a result, the price recovered and rose 3.7 yuan compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The settlement price was 988.7 yuan according to the central bank's standard gold price, approximately 16 yuan lower than the closing price, and 9 yuan less lower than the previous close. The registration price for February was 961 yuan, and for March it was 968 yuan. The morning make-up payment was 951 yuan, and the afternoon make-up payment was 956 yuan. The price of pure gold was 967.8 yuan. The spot market was stable, and trading was still active. The Tianjin gang sold 700 taels to Dafengheng, at a premium of 6 yuan, and another 1,050 taels at a premium of 5.5 yuan. The market weakened in the afternoon due to the central bank's intervention with spot silver, which was much lower than the premium. Buying appetite in the market became sluggish. The Tianjin gang sold 470 taels to Yingfenghong at a premium of 4.8 yuan. Swap premiums declined. Fuchang paid Futaiheng 420 bars from 7.3 yuan to 7.1 yuan. Afterwards, Hengxing and Dadecheng also had an appetite for premiums, but there was a lack of buyers, and it fell to around 7 yuan.

<h3>Overnight Interbank Lending Rates Gradually Eased, With Little Change in Settlement</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market price of overnight interbank lending rates was low because of abundant funds and no one accepting them, leading to a decline in prices, with a generally relaxed situation, down 0.05 yuan from the previous day's market price, calculated as 0.15 yuan, which was also a special initiative at the end of last year, presenting a good omen for the beginning of the year. The interest rate for drawing head money was gradually reduced from 3-4% to 1-2%, but supply still exceeded demand, resulting in an excessive amount of funds. The trading volume of loan tickets was over 1.3 million in the morning session, over 500,000 in new transactions, over 400,000 in the noon session, over 700,000 in small general meetings, 600,000 in pledged foreign currency transactions, 800,000 in new loans, 800,000 in banknotes withdrawn, 400,000 in banknotes issued, 900,000 in marked banknotes, 300,000 in customer funds, 400,000 in expenditure, commercial banks settlement of foreign bank bills 1.3 million, miscellaneous loans of various currencies and taxes 2.7-2.8 million, foreign exchange settlement payments of over 500,000, annual settlement payments of over 1.8 million, special exchange payments of over 400,000, telegraphic transfer payments of over 400,000, warehouse entry 400,000, Chinese banks settlement of bills over 1.9 million, taxes and miscellaneous payments of various currencies over 4.1 million, special exchange payments of over 800,000, foreign exchange settlement payments of over 1.3 million, annual settlement payments of over 1.3 million, warehouse entry 500,000, Japanese banks settlement of bills over 2 million, settlement of various currencies and miscellaneous payments over 4.2 million, foreign exchange settlement payments of over 500,000, annual settlement payments of over 2.2 million, warehouse release of 800,000, money changers' foreign public orders settlement of over 29 million, settlement of foreign head money of over 6.2 million, remittance payments from various sources of over 600,000, settlement of cash directly.

<h3>Jiangjiao Small Traders Speculating and Raising Prices</h3>
<p>Yesterday, Jiangnan small silver dollars were 846 yuan in the morning session and 860 yuan in the afternoon session, resulting in a huge difference of 14 yuan between the two sessions, because on the expenditure side, someone reported to be equipped again, so the small traders blackmailed and speculated again, and the market price in the afternoon was raised accordingly, with transactions of 1,000 jiao in the morning session and 6,000 jiao in the afternoon session. Guangdong small silver dollars were 755.2 yuan in the morning session and 755 yuan in the afternoon session, with a small difference of 0.2 yuan between the two sessions, with transactions of 135,000 jiao in the morning session and 50,000 jiao in the afternoon session.

<h3>Scattered Investors Selling Public Bonds, Market Rotating and Weakening</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the market of the Chinese Securities Exchange was fluctuating and weakening. Overnight interbank lending rates continued to ease, down to 0.15 yuan, but market sentiment was still weak. The scattered sales of retail investors were still incessant, and the market sentiment was contrary to the environment. There were also rumors in the market about British and American banks lending 200 million, which, although far from the truth, must be said to be good news, but the lack of market sentiment was still due to the year-end and transaction tax issues. If the market continues to fluctuate repeatedly like this, brewing for too long, there will be changes. At present, because trading is too clear, it is still difficult to grasp how the trend will be. Yesterday's progress was almost every session leading to weakness. The decline was slightly larger in the morning session, and it recovered slightly in the afternoon session. There was no change in the morning session, and the afternoon session declined slightly by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan, creating a dull situation. The afternoon closing showed some chaos, with high and low mutual visibility. There is only one week left of trading this month, and it is expected that it will be slightly more active afterwards. In summary, the market prices continued to weaken by 0.05 to 0.3-0.4 yuan. The total number of transactions was 8,991,000 yuan. The results of its rises and falls are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Slightly Recovers</h3>
<p>New Fung &amp; Co. reports that yesterday (the 16th) the New York stock market opened with a slight increase, then turned flat. As the foreign exchange market had returned to order, stock prices remained firm, rising a few cents to two dollars compared to the previous day. Except for gold and silver stocks, which rose only slightly, many others recovered their losses from the previous day. Traders have already discounted the previous day's declines and are now awaiting the Supreme Court's decision. The bond market was sluggish with mixed prices. U.S. government bonds were slightly weak. Stocks on the small exchange were firm. Wheat also rose today.

<h3>Yarn Market Shows Some Covering</h3>
<p>The yarn market shows a slight firming trend due to rumors that Mr. Wang of the Tongji Company has taken delivery of several thousand bales of yarn for this month. Another rumor suggests that manufacturers are suffering significant losses due to high cotton prices and low yarn prices, and may consider early shutdowns or delayed start-ups between the end of the lunar year and the beginning of the new year. This has caused market sentiment to stir, leading to short covering and a slight boost in the market.</p>
<h3>Gold Rooster Slightly Up</h3>
<p>The opening of the raw yarn futures market was firm. Market rumors were rife with bullish sentiment, leading to slightly more buying. Short covering contributed to firmness, with all months rising by two, three, four, or five cents. The afternoon market remained calm without significant progress. However, the bullish attitude of major players was unusually stable, and available lots were scarce. As a result, near-term contracts closed flat, while distant contracts rose by two to four cents. Sales included 250 bales from Da Kee, 250 bales from Shen Kee, 400 bales from Chang Feng, 250 bales from Heng Chang, and 250 bales from De Kee; purchases included 600 bales from Xin Chang, 450 bales from Geng Feng, 250 bales from Yuan Da, 250 bales from Rui Da, and 300 bales from De Kee. The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Yarn Futures　Highest Price　Lowest Price　Closing Price　Change　Open Interest</p>
<p>January　　184.1　　183.8　　184.0　Up 0.40　27,000</p>
<p>February　　185.5　　184.6　　184.8　0.10　41,850</p>
<p>March　　186.8　　186.4　　186.8　0.60　52,650</p>
<p>April　　187.9　　187.3　　187.7　0.30　52,550</p>
<p>May　　189.2　　188.6　　188.8　0.20　29,000</p>
<p>June　　189.5　　189.3　　189.5　0.50　6,400</p>
<p>Total　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　209,450</p>
<h3>Actual Sales Are Slow</h3>
<p>Actual yarn sales are somewhat sluggish. Total purchases by various firms for the day amounted to 520 bales, with little change in prices. The purchase amounts by various firms are as follows:</p>
<p>Haizhou 50, Wuhu 5, Guangdong 170, Henan 20</p>
<p>Shantou 15, Xiamen 5, Inland 50, Nanyang 20</p>
<p>Counterparts 35, Anqing 10, Changsha 10, Yunnan 120</p>
<p>The cotton market is firming, but Indian cotton is falling sharply, with Omra falling by six rupees. The local market has not been significantly affected, showing a glimpse of market sentiment. In reality, the transaction volume for this month still has more than 90,000 dan remaining. Delivery is likely not yet fully prepared. Distant contracts are also sharply higher, leading to a price increase.</p>
<h3>Zheng Brand Cotton Is Slightly Lively</h3>
<p>The opening of the raw cotton futures market was relatively flat due to a sharp drop in Indian cotton prices and a bearish outlook. With flat gold prices, most expected a decline. However, tightness due to delivery issues for this month caused a turnaround. Near-month contracts fell until the close, ending flat, while distant months rose by one to one and a half cents. The afternoon opening remained soft, with rumors of further declines in the Indian cotton gray market.

Spot prices fell by five points, near-term contracts rose by four to seven points, and distant contracts fell by two to four points. The British cotton market was weak, with spot prices down nine points and futures down six points.

<h3>The Price of Sacrifice</h3>
<p>—Bored</p>
<p>Our country's ancient philosophy of life has many clear teachings and creeds, such as "A wise man protects himself," "A man who knows fate does not stand under a crumbling wall," "A son of a thousand gold should not sit under a drooping eave," etc., all of which are appropriate ways to assess the situation and protect one's life. A more meaningful and superhuman philosophy is expressed by Mencius: "Life is what I desire, and righteousness is also what I desire. If I cannot have both, I will give up life for righteousness." Later, Song Confucian scholars elaborated on this meaning, saying that "Losing integrity is a major matter, while starvation is a minor matter." They saw integrity and righteousness as more important than life. Apart from that, there is nothing more important than life itself. This is why the land of Eastern culture has stood alone for thousands of years.</p>
<p>Foreigners are, after all, barbarians. They do not view life as so important. As long as they succeed in their careers, they can disregard their lives. They have a spirit of adventure, great ambition, and are not afraid of thousands of difficulties. They are determined to do whatever it takes. Just like exploring the temperate zone, the North and South Poles, crossing the Atlantic by plane, and flying around the world in a week, they do not understand the danger of life, they only know that the goal can be achieved. Young people in our country have recently understood some of the philosophy of life. Therefore, they do not value their own lives very much. Therefore, cases of suicide have emerged one after another, countless. But upon investigating the reasons for suicide, there are only two: (1) economic oppression, and (2) heartbreak, or being unable to achieve the goal of love due to economic oppression. Besides this, I have not heard of any particularly valuable sacrifices. I ask, what value exists in such sacrifices?</p>
<p>But recently there has been genuine progress. Just turn to the recent newspapers. Haven't you seen that pedestrian Pan Deming is about to return home? Haven't you seen the heroic feat of elementary school students traveling around the country? Haven't you seen a Chinese female aviator flying from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore? Indeed, these individuals all have a spirit of adventure, and it cannot be said that they have absolutely no meaning. This is something I deeply admire. But now is the world of flying, not the world of walking. Such a round-the-world walking endeavor only increases personal experience and knowledge, and does not make a great contribution to society and the country. As for the female aviator's flight, the flight from Kuala Lumpur to Singapore is only a little over two hundred miles. In the eyes of us Chinese, it is already a remarkable thing, but in the eyes of foreigners, it is still insignificant.</p>
<p>But this kind of thing is indeed considered a rare heroic feat in our country. The nature of our Chinese people is often to take a derisive attitude. When they succeed in their careers, they only feel jealous and suspicious. If they fail, they will ridicule in every way. Therefore, if someone wants to do something, they must first consider whether they can succeed. Success is good, but if it fails, they will be ridiculed by others. In this way, the courage to do this will disappear without a trace. Therefore, to do something, one does not have to ask whether it will succeed or fail, but only ask whether it should be done or not. If I think it is something that should be done, I will boldly do it. Success or failure is certainly not a concern, and let them laugh and scold! Only then can</p>
<h3>My First Acquaintance with Winter</h3>
<p>— Shi Jingbo</p>
<p>My grandfather was a very amiable old man, tall and large in stature, a most typical northerner, with a long beard, a few strands of which were golden and gleaming, the rest pale and fluffy, adorning his kind and approachable face, making him especially respectable.</p>
<p>He managed his extremely complex family affairs with great diligence and remarkable patience. Within that huge and complicated household, he indeed succeeded, being a model of perseverance. Later, he used this strength to create his own family business, character, and historically significant achievements, struggling up from a declining merchant family, striving to study, and teaching my eldest uncle and my father to read as well. My second and third uncles farmed, their own land not being enough, so they rented land from others. Although his family business did not fulfill his perfect hopes, on the basis of the significance of striving in life, he gained the respect and faith of the entire society.</p>
<p>He passed away from incurable cerebral hemorrhage at the age of sixty-one. I was only five years old at that time, and it was then that I first came to know the face of winter.</p>
<p>On the night of the seventh day of the twelfth month, he, my eldest uncle, and my father returned from somewhere. I remember it was a very cold night. My grandmother took me to the center of the courtyard to look towards the stone path opposite, finally seeing them return. I was the first to see a faintly shining light appear at the end of the stone path. My grandmother immediately determined it was my grandfather and the others returning. Sure enough, we opened the gate, and it really was my grandfather and the others returning. The shining light turned out to be their paper lanterns.</p>
<p>I don't remember what happened later. Vaguely, it seems my grandfather carried me to my mother's room to sleep, but I knew nothing.</p>
<p>I don't know who carried me to another room, and I woke up. I immediately felt that a tremendous event had erupted in my sleep. A miserable, painful, and despairing atmosphere immediately seized me, refusing to let go. I contracted a very severe case of typhoid fever.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>The disease immediately spread to my eldest brother.</p>
<p>I was staying in my mother's birthing room. On one heated brick bed (炕), slept my mother, my newborn younger sister, my two eldest brothers and I, all suffering from severe typhoid fever, and my maternal grandmother, who was sixty or seventy years old. Sometimes, my grandmother and eldest aunt also slept there. Strangely, in such a dirty and foul-smelling world, our typhoid fever did not spread to a third person.</p>
<p>By the time I regained consciousness, my grandfather had already been buried. I saw my mother sitting on the edge of the heated brick bed, covered in a quilt, and heard the baby crying. Beside me, my eldest brother lay unconscious. The windows were covered with something, making it difficult to see the light outside, which was very stifling; but I couldn't move at all, not even having the strength to turn over.</p>
<p>I remember that winter passed like this. This was my first acquaintance with winter, and the first time since I had life that I knew there was a severe winter. In human society, I first vaguely developed a conscious relationship with nature, which was when I began to understand the seasonality of social life.</p>
<p>Winter in this seasonality is almost a huge threat and ravagement for the working people.</p>
<h3>A Story of Life</h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>He added a lump of coal to the fireplace for the third time, a move that elicited laughter from the other person.</p>
<p>The fireplace was originally blazing with flames, but he extinguished them by shoveling in lumps of coal one after another, instead raising a pungent coal smoke.</p>
<p>Would you say he lacked experience with fireplaces? That's far from the truth. He could make delicious dishes on a gas stove, and could immediately fix a fuse after the electric lights went out, mend socks and sew clothes. When necessary, he could even do a thing or two... His various experiences could be compiled into a profitable encyclopedia. What he lacked was the knack for dealing with women, and this woman had knocked on his bedroom door five minutes ago.</p>
<p>"It's too cold to go outside for a walk, but you haven't learned the skill of lighting a fireplace!" The woman's affected voice burst into laughter.</p>
<p>This sentence was not without reason: he often escaped from his apartment because of her disturbances, wandering aimlessly until he could no longer support his tired body and returned home. Using such a clumsy method to escape a woman he didn't like only further stimulated her unspeakable feelings, causing her to entangle herself in his apartment day and night.</p>
<p>Tonight, the wind exposed the true face of winter, naturally unsuitable for a stroll leaning on a cane. He had knocked on the doors of several friends, but these urbanites had all gone to the frenzied dance halls. So, he thought of catching the 9:15 movie, but returning to the apartment after it ended would still be too early, so he went home with the thought that tonight might be an exception, planning to brew tea and read. As he was facing the fireplace, lying in a rocking chair and swinging his legs, footsteps sounded in the hallway.</p>
<p>His bedroom was the last one in the apartment. Without a doubt, the footsteps had reached the door by the time people inside could hear them clearly. Sure enough, there was a gentle knock on the door, but the visitor had already anticipated there would be no answer, barging in like a Chinese manager entering a compradore's office, taking off her coat, hanging it behind the door, and dragging another rocking chair to sit next to him to warm herself by the fireplace.</p>
<p>The host's attitude of ignoring her was an old trick. While reading the newspaper, he folded it haphazardly, and when facing the fireplace, of course, he worked hard at adding coal.</p>
<p>He heard her sarcastic remarks and finally raised his head, spitting out words that seemed to have been prepared:</p>
<p>"Aren't you afraid of the cold? Coming such a long way!"</p>
<p>"Isn't there a fireplace here!"</p>
<p>The host couldn't answer with a second sentence. Flames bursting from the coal licked at two crimson faces like serpent tongues, a deadly silence except for their breaths.</p>
<p>In these few minutes, let me introduce the female guest's outline!</p>
<p>She was known as some kind of social butterfly, and the men hanging on her arm were as changeable as her clothes. She was immersed in a decadent lifestyle, so she sought stimulation. Naturally, wouldn't men be the best targets? However, since she discovered this man who was inept with women, she seemed to have discovered the most powerful stimulant in the world. Thus, this corner of the apartment was staging this farcical tragedy.</p>
<p>Of course, we cannot predict the outcome before the curtain falls.</p>
<p>But humans are the soul of all things. This kind of trick is being acted out everywhere just right; big fights, small quarrels, this story can be created at will, seeing the opportunity and acting. Life is like a stage, can you not believe this saying?</p>

<h3>Hesitation at Dusk</h3>
<p>— A Chun</p>
<p>Girls are afraid of autumn, but I am most afraid of that gloomy dusk!</p>
<p>It is a distorted winter. The drizzle is continuous, without any wind at all. In the quietness, there is only the rhythm of the clock. Every corner of the room is filled with an elusive emptiness. Sitting alone, letting my long dress drag on the ground, letting my soul be free, letting my thoughts be liberated, giving myself an honest dissection of everything I have stored, in this gloom of dusk, internal contradictions surge!</p>
<p>Surrounded by a rosy circle, a child who doesn't understand anything strangely obtains inexplicable joy like a free little bird. When the roses of May unfold, a beautiful spring story has already begun!</p>
<p>It was an early summer evening. Darkness had filled the earth. The evening breeze brought sparse raindrops. The distant shimmering lights and the hustle and bustle on the Waibaidu Bridge were truly the beginning of a night metropolis. The two of us were on the grass under the trees, watching our slanting shadows disappear, all the way to hearing the waves of the river, seeing off the leisurely chats of the wandering immortals, still hesitating in our lingering. At that time, the moon girl had some light, and the waves surged even more eagerly forward. Besides the distant commotion coming from the night metropolis, there was also that foolish man who mourned the fallen nation nearby! Gradually, a blur had enveloped the surroundings, and everything disappeared with it, as if only our two ardent hearts remained in this large world! Without the hypocrisy of morality, without the cruel iron armor, shedding the shackles of unfreedom, we showed the naked sparks of spring. He gripped my hand tightly:</p>
<p>"I won't leave you, Chun! I will never leave you!"</p>
<p>"... Martyrdom." Smiling, I lowered my head.</p>
<p>"What method is there to never leave you, Chun!"</p>
<p>"What method do you say there is?"</p>
<p>"Let's 'that'!"</p>
<p>When I understood his intentions, it was as if I had received an unexpected thunderbolt. Truly, I hadn't expected him to mention this issue so quickly. Silently, I said nothing, waiting until he let go of my hand and gave me a final kiss, I still silently lowered my head and left him.</p>
<p>At night, I hurriedly burrowed into bed, covering my head with the quilt. The entire night, I couldn't find a sleep demon. Truly, I was immersed in the pain of contradiction again!</p>
<p>Without being deceived by the "sacred," and without thinking about the coming of any grave, only the terrible life of a mother began in my imagination! Ah! I will not be a child! I will lose my freedom, I will pass away in the obligatory life of a family, and I will climb to another stage!</p>
<p>"No, I will never agree, I must prolong my golden age!"</p>
<p>"No, I will never agree, I must not quickly end my free life!"</p>
<p>In my heart, I made such a definite resolution.</p>
<p>The next day, I rushed to his place and expressed some childish thoughts, saying that we should postpone it for another year or two, right?</p>
<p>I thought it should be a cold reply. When I also thought, in the same way, of "not being able to live without him," I regretted my words again!</p>
<p>Now, in this dusk, given the prolonged contemplation, given the past remains, given his burly, lovely shadow, I am immersed in hesitation again!</p>
<p>Between people, some similar things are unavoidable. A woman can never escape those inevitable stages. Why should I deliberately make myself suffer?</p>
<p>Giving way to this conclusion, I hurried away from the hesitation of dusk!</p>
<h3>Evening Voyage</h3>
<p>— Ding Weinan</p>
<p>This is an autumn.</p>
<p>The dried-up river water shows the leanness of the riverbed. The gray-black small reefs reveal their desolate aura, bringing the sparse barking of dogs. This is the slight ripple rippling in the gentle breeze. The boatmen row what poets call a small leaf boat, floating on this babbling river and going up to the ancient castle. The so-called one-leaf boat, when rowed by these boatmen, is truly more difficult than going up the Shu Road. The people pulling the towline on the shore have their waists aching. The person at the helm is very strong, but the slowness of the voyage is still struggling in this river bay for a day.</p>
<p>From the faint light of dawn, one can see the Longtan Pagoda emerging from the horizon. In the light of the sunrise, bathing in its mixture of mountains and clouds, it stands majestic and clear on that protruding hill, like a proud bamboo shoot, also like a straight pen. Next to it is a temple surrounded by it. It stands proudly in the center of this temple, towering. The white surrounding wall of the temple is so small and squatting at its feet, like a white collar on the neck of a Westerner. In people's sight, this pagoda releases immense dignity. The copper gourd on top of the pagoda reflects golden light under the oblique rays of the setting sun, dazzling people's eyes, like a seashell on the beach, shimmering and trembling with the pulse of nature in this evening on that distant horizon, nurturing the embryo of the night!</p>
<p>The struggling people finally dragged the bottom of the boat forward, although the river water was dry and the bones were exposed. Gradually, they were sailing near Longtan under the pagoda. The river water was gradually getting deeper. The pagoda was slowly rising towards us, its outline even clearer. The river water was deep and green. The matter of pulling the towline still could not reduce the boatmen's</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>work. The wind was light, almost unable to stir up the slight ripples of the river water, but it stirred up the people's bodies, and there was almost a lot of coolness. Although the reeds over there were a little swaying, a little floating, the shadows falling in the water, given the wave marks on the bottom of the boat going upstream, shattered her tenderness in that water. Those slender shadows seem to be whispering! Geese sometimes raise their flight from their clusters, which will startle their fragile souls, but on their bodies is crystallized the deep news of autumn, and the quiet moan in the brewing of this night!</p>
<p>Gradually, it became blurred. The majestic shadow of the pagoda fell in the pool. There are many ships sailing to and from here, raising white sails, destroying the shadow of the pagoda bathing in the pool in this vast twilight. Shaking, trembling sky! In the cabin of the ship, the lights were lit, and cooking was beginning. Looking down at the bottom of the water, one can only see the white sky, and the drifting idle clouds, but if you look carefully underneath, it is dark and a little frightening, like things from mythology, appearing before your eyes. If the white sky and the drifting idle clouds all disappear, the changing components will not be destroyed.</p>
<p>That ancient castle is also appearing vaguely. The moon is rising, hanging in the eastern sky. I don't know where the sound of the bell is, deeply knocking on the heart of the traveler who is embarking on the journey. If it is said that this will not bring good news to the traveler, it must be a deeply painful departure!</p>
<p>The voyagers are all holding frightened hearts. The turbulent era has brought unrest in the countryside. The ancient castle over there in the vastness is a symbol of comfort for people, especially at this moment. The vast night, with the sound of the water of the boat moving forward, rocking the shadow of the moon, breaking the stars, carrying the heart of a traveler, floats on this vast journey!</p>
<h3>Temptation</h3>
<p>— Luo Shan</p>
<p>(Your sons are living off their mother's tears, do you really want to go back or not?)</p>
<p>It was a bitterly cold winter dusk. I was shrinking and sitting by the stove, warming myself and leisurely reading Browning's lyric poetry, poetry, to express to my passionately loved woman. I remember I made a face and called him my friend, stopping mid-sentence for fear of causing some kind of misunderstanding between us. I merely answered with a bitter smile!</p>
<p>(Life's process is in this way, you understand my life philosophy, don't you? This is the powerful proof of my life philosophy!)</p>
<p>Indeed, that friend's words did not stimulate even a single fiber in me, and I was very surprised. I understood very well the desert sands and hurricanes of northern Mongolia in winter, the construction and incomplete equipment of the house, the situation, the pity of the wife suffering from insomnia and neurasthenia. However, I did not feel a single bit of compassion for that pity. As for children, I, in my hedonism, thought it was a burden, a meaningless thing. However, on the third night after that friend left, under the bright electric lights, my lover and I were each looking at books with our heads lowered in a comfortable sofa, I discovered a piece of work that resembled a true depiction of my life. My heart trembled slightly, and then an uneasy life began, and I almost regarded the woman sitting next to me as an incarnation of the devil, and began to curse the blindness of life, the error of the starting point of complete individualism.</p>
<p>("Isn't the greatest mission of 'man' living in the world to reduce human suffering and help humanity as his duty? What I have done...")</p>
<p>My eyes closed. My heart was whipped.</p>
<p>It was Hauptmann's German drama "The Sunken Bell," which tells how the protagonist Heinrich is fascinated by Rautendelein and forgets his duties as a father and husband, and the pastor's advice to him is the same as the words my friend advised me three days ago. However, the protagonist of "The Sunken Bell" did not think of his wife and sons who lived off his tears until his death. What about me?</p>
<p>(What about me? What method do I use to get rid of these ah, these shackles of vanity and material enjoyment, which dominate me?</p>
<p>I lowered, lowered my slicked-back head. Something like a steel arrow seemed to have pierced right through my chest, causing a slight pain.</p>

<p>Opening "Dancing Girl"</p>
<p>Sighing frequently, sighing repeatedly. The dancing girl who runs the business is too unfeeling. Remembering meeting for the first time in the dancing hall. Falling in love at first sight. Remembering the intimate words whispered by the pillow. I thought it was a thousand-mile marriage led by a single thread. Who knew that the words were still ringing in my ears when the heart had already changed. Abandoning all previous affection in one stroke. Wishing I could cut you into two pieces. Cutting the threads of love to avoid hurting the spirit. I hate that you willingly betrayed the promises made before the flowers. What about living together in the same bed and dying together in the same grave? What about wishing to be birds flying wing to wing in heaven? What about wishing to be rooted trees growing inseparably on earth? Fortunately, my heart carefully awakened to the situation. Recognizing your false affection, false righteousness, and false diligence. I have spent countless money on you. I have been slighted several times. I have often quarreled with my wife because of you. Abandoning the love of a married couple. I have wasted time and lost my job for you, enduring much suffering. Friends and relatives have severed contact, not coming to my door. Now you are you and I am me. Beating the mandarin ducks, separating them in two places. I regret not listening to my wife's good advice. I regret not listening to my relatives' and friends' admonishments. It would be better to retreat while the tide is high and seek a way to make a living. A prodigal son can turn over a new leaf. I advise everyone to be careful when falling in love in the dancing hall.</p>

<p>Clouds and mist blow open, revealing the green sky. The sun rises to the top of the valley, and the shadows are round. Luxuriant and tender threads along the grass on the steps. The color is like immortal sesame, green reflecting the curtain. Flowers bloom with purple buds containing morning dew. Birds sing on the living branches. A recluse on the sunny slope has a broad mind. Sitting alone leisurely, creating double cave eaves. Hanging a cold and accurate plum tune. White paper letters facing a couplet. The upper couplet is: The wind blows jasmine, and the fragrance is far away. The lower couplet is: The rain moistens pine cones, and the green color is fresh. The calligraphy is generous and truly wonderful. The inscription at the end is Mao Jian. Even the strange Buddha hand is offered with ice in a basin. Lotus flowers bloom in the vase before the rain. The purple sandalwood frame is adorned with pearl orchids. The smoke from the Meng Ding furnace permeates the fragrance. Looking at several volumes of early spring golden pieces and illustrated books of all flowers. Drinking several cups of Long Jing flag spears and superior spring. Playing a plain zither and lamenting the concubine's grievances. Singing of the Fisherman and Woodcutter's Answers from Mount Wuyi. Ignoring the Qimen market is bustling. Only seeking the crane top to flow freely. Longevity spring often plays in the garden scenery. The elixir tries the immortal dan in person. Cloud dwellers enjoy the lotus heart joy. Six An has nothing to do, like a god. Avoid being pulled by bitter nails.</p>

<h3>Claudette Colbert's Correspondence with a Peculiar Fan (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Ti Yun</p>
<p>Several days passed, and the fan sent another letter, with nothing but the salutation and closing, and a small dot in the middle.</p>
<p>Claudette received the letter and couldn't help but laugh. The letters were getting simpler and simpler, so simple as to be just a dot. Then she had another whimsical idea: to write him a letter with nothing at all, not even a dot. So she wrote a letter, with only the salutation and closing, and a blank space in the middle, adding a line of small print below: "You think you're so clever, please fill it in yourself!" Sure enough, a thick reply arrived a few days later. In the fan's letter, he wrote, "As you commanded, I have filled in the blank space in your letter, but I wonder if you dare send it?"</p>
<p>Claudette Colbert laughed heartily upon hearing this, saying, "Look at the letter he wrote for me, how daring!" As she spoke, she handed the letter that Mr. Daniel Burke had written for her to the journalist. He took it and read it, and it said, "Dear Mr. Burke, I have read many of your letters, and I feel that you are not an unpleasant person. Why don't you come to Los Angeles for a visit? We can have a great time together. And using our correspondence as a benchmark, I believe we will talk endlessly after we meet. Come on. My heart is jumping for joy for you, and waiting for your glorious arrival!" At the end, he even signed it for her: "Your beloved, Claudette Colbert."</p>
<p>Since receiving that letter, Claudette Colbert knew that this joke had gone too far. How should she deal with it? If she really sent that letter, and the fan really ran to Hollywood to see her, wouldn't that make it even more difficult for her? But if she didn't send the letter, it would seem that she was a half-wit and lacked a sense of humor.</p>
<p>She was really hesitant. She put the letter in her wallet, took it from home to the studio, and from the studio to home. For a week, the letter was not sent. One day, she suddenly shouted her own name: "Claudette Colbert, you are really a fool!" She made up her mind and sent the letter. But she added a line at the end of the letter: "I dare to send the letter, but don't you dare to come!"</p>
<p>Three weeks after the letter was sent, one day Claudette was at the studio when a studio messenger handed her a letter. She took a look, and it was from the fan. She was having lunch in the dressing room at the time. She immediately opened the letter and read it. It said, "Dear Miss Colbert: I am very sorry for not being able to join you for lunch. The staff at the studio don't seem to believe me: where would a Mr. Daniel Burke come from, travelling all the way from Oklahoma to see you? Therefore, I left this letter, please have dinner with me at the Ambassador Hotel tonight." It was signed: "Your daring Daniel."</p>
<p>Claudette felt as if she had been electrocuted, and couldn't move. This guy really came! What to do? She didn't know what kind of person he was. Was he old? Young? She asked the studio messenger if he had seen the person. He shook his head and said no. Claudette then asked a friend to come and told him all about her predicament, asking him to go to the hotel first to take a look.</p>
<p>The friend returned after a while. He smiled and said, "Mr. Burke is a handsome man, the likes of which I have never seen before. He is over six feet tall and very burly. His skin is slightly dark. He is about thirty years old." Claudette's heart fluttered, and she couldn't wait to rush over and kiss him, but out of consideration, she wrote a letter, thanking him for the invitation, and inviting him to her home on a Friday evening for a chat.</p>
<p>Friday arrived. Half past seven arrived. Then Mr. Daniel Burke arrived. Claudette was combing her hair when her butler brought in a card, saying that Mr. Burke had arrived. Claudette said, "Please ask him to wait, I'll be down in a moment." The butler hesitated for a moment, then stammered, "Mr. Burke is a woman." Claudette was baffled. When she went down to see for herself, there was only an old lady in the drawing-room. She took a step forward when she saw Claudette and shook her hand. Her hair was snow white. Apart from a few small wrinkles, her skin was as red and tender as a child's. Her eyes deserved the elegant title of "clear, sparkling eyes," they were truly lively and lovely. She opened her mouth and said, "Let me introduce myself. I am Mrs. Lucy Pembroke, and I am the one who has been corresponding with you. Daniel Burke is just my pen name..."</p>
<p>Claudette rushed out again at this point in the story. After a while, she brought a large photograph. She said, "Look. This is Mr. Burke, the most interesting person. Whenever I encounter disappointment, I just need to see her photo, and all my anger disappears!" (The End)</p>

<h3>Review of "The Great Secret"</h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>British Agent 丨 Grand Theater</p>
<p>Since the resumption of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, we have had the opportunity to appreciate many Soviet films. Since the restoration of normal relations between the United States and Russia, we have also had the opportunity to see American producers adapting Soviet revolutionary stories into films.</p>
<p>The Soviet Union is no longer regarded as a monster, and it recently joined the League of Nations, presiding over the important situation in Geneva. Therefore, the production of such works is not without commercial security, as the people of the world are paying attention to this new country. Thus, R.H. Bruce Lockhart's original work was portrayed on the Hollywood set.</p>
<p>Yes, this somewhat depicts the so-called revolution after the collapse of the Kerensky government, and how, under the Lenin-led regime, it made a separate peace with Germany and how it countered the intervention of European and American countries in the revolution. However, under the representation of American filmmakers, it cannot but be distorted, with many subjective fabrications deviating from the true historical record. Obviously, the playwright emphasized the opposition to the Soviet government's separate armistice, believing that it damaged the Allied front, and intentionally ignored the ardent desire for peace of the general public under the line of hunger and death at that time. (These are fully portrayed in Pudovkin's "The End of St. Petersburg" or other Soviet films.) Similarly, the essence of intervention in the revolution is also concealed under the pretext of opposing peace talks, with very little positive representation, although there is also an exposure of the international intervention conspiracy at the dance party. More importantly, the romance between the revolutionary female detective and the British diplomatic representative is exaggerated with great interest. In the entire film, the so-called entanglement of revolution and love occupies a very important part. In the end, the aristocratic revolutionary woman follows her lover back to the so-called beautiful and gentle England. Love triumphs over revolution, and this ending reveals the vulgarity of the playwright's ideas.</p>
<p>In any case, this is always a Soviet revolutionary story as understood by American filmmakers. If we compare the impressions we get from Soviet films with this, we can clearly see that under the same subject matter, there are completely different styles. Since the playwright's ideas are as described above, we will further explore the contrast in presentation techniques.</p>
<p>In Soviet films, what can usually be seen is the resolute, determined, brave, and straightforward national character, which Soviet writers express with a heavy atmosphere and relaxed tones. However, what is presented in "The Great Secret" is a completely American sentiment. On the one hand, the demeanor of the defense gentlemen, such as the protagonist Stan, is like that of an American young master officer, not to mention, but on the revolutionary woman, she is also not a Russian-flavored woman. In short, the inherent Russian life, habits, and emotions are not grasped in this. What we feel is always an American writer's representation of Russian thoughts, landscapes, and characters, without giving us a real and profound Russian flavor. What is gratifying is that for several leading figures of the time, such as Lenin, Stalin, and Kerensky, the actors' makeup is similar to what we see in the photos, especially Lenin's demeanor. In a novel translated by Ye Lingfeng, we once read such a description. This kind of aftertaste can make people feel interested. Beyond that, there is nothing else that needs to be mentioned.</p>

<h3>"Resistance" Opens Today</h3>
<p>"Resistance" is a film depicting the Great War in Europe. In addition to giving us the same thrilling stimulation as the several great war films seen before, this film skillfully contains extremely profound meaning and extremely interesting plot in the realistic depiction of war. Therefore, this film cannot be compared with other war films.</p>
<p>In terms of meaning, "Resistance" focuses on suggesting how people should prepare for national defense to cope with possible foreign troubles. At a time when the great powers are actively preparing for the Second World War, especially under the current situation in China today, this kind of film, which is intended to remind us and stimulate our nationalism, has its special status and the value of the times and cannot be ignored by us.</p>
<p>In terms of the plot, this film begins with how the German army sniped at the British and French Allied forces when everything was calm. Then it tells how the British and French Allied forces trained gunmen to deal with the German snipers. Finally, it ends with the ending of two Russian gunmen in the Allied forces. The evolution of the story is fascinating at every turn. It is also a characteristic of war films.</p>
<p>The film has Chinese and English subtitles, which can be said to be a unique feature of foreign films. It is said that the film will open today at the Carlton.</p>

<h3>Forsaking All Others (7)</h3>
<p>— Su Yin</p>
<p>After Connie appeared suddenly, Geoffrey also appeared suddenly. Geoffrey knew that Connie had a plan to trap Mary, so he was constantly on guard and followed Connie. But neither Connie nor Mary knew this. By the time Mary found out, she was already sitting in the car with Geoffrey. Connie's plan also failed to materialize.</p>
<p>But Mary still loved Dillon after all. Since their reunion after a long absence, the flame of love in her heart suddenly sprouted again. She thought it wouldn't hurt to meet occasionally, talk occasionally, and have a rare Sunday drive to the countryside together. She liked to see his smile, because he was a handsome man after all, and she had already promised her heart to him. Geoffrey later found out and had tried to persuade her bitterly, but she took his words as water off a duck's back, and it had no effect at all. One day, when she was in a hurry, she said, "Am I a shameless person, a lawbreaker, who can't meet a man?" Geoffrey also said, "Dillon is different! He once left you standing alone in front of the altar to get married. Besides, you already love him deeply, and you will disregard everything. You are hurting yourself." Mary said, "Alright, alright. I'm hurting myself! You don't have to worry about me, and you don't have to build any monuments to chastity." Sure enough, Geoffrey stopped interfering from then on.</p>
<p>One day, she and Dillon drove to the countryside to play again. They drove endlessly, wanting to go to Paula's house. Mary said, "That's an empty house in the countryside." Dillon said, "It won't be empty when we get there." Mary looked at Dillon's face, wanting to know what he meant. Dillon smiled and replied, "I love you." and lowered his head to kiss her. Mary's heart couldn't help but flutter, and she hooked her arms around Dillon's neck. In that instant, something went wrong. The car fell into a ditch by the road!</p>
<p>They had no choice but to leave the car and walk on the dirt road. They walked countless miles, walking until they were covered in sweat, with no romance to speak of. Finally, they came to a gas station, but there was no one there to repair cars. Fortunately, there was a young man there who drove them for a while, taking them to the house closest to Paula's, asking them to go there first to get the key to the empty house. They took the key, and then set off on foot again. But the heavens were not beautiful, and a heavy rain started. Therefore, by the time they reached their destination, they were both soaked to the skin.</p>
<p>They entered the house and rummaged around for old clothes. But they only found some of Paula's shirts, so Dillon could only take off his own clothes and put on women's shirts. Afternoon turned into dusk. Dusk turned into night. At first, when they were at the gas station, Mary had asked Dillon to make a phone call and ask his waiter Johnson to bring the car to pick them up. But Dillon deliberately didn't make the call. Now, Dillon himself regretted it. Because there was nothing to eat in this empty house. They found a can of sardines, but after the can was opened, it accidentally fell to the ground and was eaten by the cat.</p>
<p>With nothing to think about and nothing to do, they could only light a kerosene lamp and light a fire in the fireplace to keep warm. After a while, Dillon suddenly thought of a wonderful way to keep warm. He suddenly put his arms around Mary and kissed her, saying, "I love you so much..." Mary pushed him away and pointed to something on the piano and said, "Look. What is that?" Dillon took a look and couldn't help but feel angry. It turned out to be a cat, the cat that had just eaten the sardines, sitting obediently on the piano and looking at them. Dillon grabbed a pillow and shouted, "Get out of here!" and threw it over. Mary quickly called out to stop him, but it was too late. Another disaster. (To be continued)</p>
