<p>時評</p>
<h3>讀北平文化敎育界宣言</h3>
<p>— 秉</p>
<p>北平文化敎育界蔣夢麟·傅斯年·胡適·蔣廷黻等二十餘人日前發表宣言。謂「我們堅决的反對一切脫離中央和組織特殊政治機構的陰謀的舉動。我們要求政府用全國力量。維持國家的領土及行政的完整。語極簡短。而剛之氣。自然流露於言外。當華北巳有所謂　冀東防共自治委員會出現之今日。讀之尤覺精神發皇。我族大衆之要求。雖端緒萬千。然衡量之勢。降至最低最少限度。務期其必須兌現者。亦惟此宣言中所舉之數語而已。</p>
<p>知識分子多數好爲憑空之論。其評議時事也。「中國」「中國」不離於口。不絕於書。伴之者則爲誕責之辭。指摘弊病。不一而足。使人聆其語言。誦其文章。搔首徬徨。莫知所可。而彼固超然於雲表。一若不隸於任何國籍者。夫諱疾忌醫。誠屬非是。顧立言允宜注目於此時此地之實際情勢。我國現况。鮮可滿意。誰不知者。惟其所以致此。咎不歸於個人。亦不屬於一羣人。凡所謂中國人者。肩背上殆莫不多少負有責任。故今日之至要。卽不能對一切現實悉不加以譴貢。亦須於譴責以外。別謀自處之道。其義甚明顯。緣中國乃中國人之中國也。</p>
<p>知識分子多數又好爲妥協苟安之計。昔年有人提議。以北平為文化城。最爲此說之堅證。而南方人士。以爲華北危機隱伏。家有子弟。不欲送往北方學校肄業。亦爲此種心理之具體表現。詎知凡此逆來順受之舉。適足以鼓起野心者加緊侵迫之熱望。苟舉國如是。鐵蹄馳驅。如入無人之境矣。胡適氏曾有言曰。「華北停戰雖不能使敵人將東四省退出一尺一寸。至少也應該使他們不得在東四省以外多佔一尺一寸的土地。」至於最近。胡氏慨然曰。「現在看來。我完全錯了。」（見本月十七日大公報星期論文）雖胡氏歸咎於守禦工作之忽略。然於其當時之持論退讓。缺乏心理上之守禦力量。未必不深自悔之。故於其所簽署之宣言中。乃有「用全國力量。維持國家的領土及行政的完整」之語。此一轉變。實我族前途生命之所繫。自信有力量。而又善用其力量。爭存之樞機。在於是矣。</p>

<h3>具象美（續）</h3>
<p>— 豐子愷</p>
<p>在古人的詩文各方面，我的記憶沒有這般壞，現在就可想起不少的例子來。也摘錄些在下面，以供吟味：</p>
<p>太平待詔歸來日，睽與先生解載袍。</p>
<p>十四萬人齊解甲，更無一個是男兒。</p>
<p>强欲從君無那老，將因臥病解朝衣。</p>
<p>嚴陵台下桐江水，解釣鱸魚有幾人？</p>
<p>年年戰骨埋荒外，空見葡萄入漢家。</p>
<p>天命苟如此，且進杯中物。</p>
<p>安得萬里裘，蓋裹周四垠。</p>
<p>君王忍把平陳業，只據雷塘數畝田？</p>
<p>舊時王謝堂前燕，飛入尋常百姓家。</p>
<p>人生在世不稱意，明朝散髮弄扁舟。</p>
<p>座中泣下誰最多？江州司馬靑衫濕。</p>
<p>何當共翦西窗燭，却話巴山夜雨時。</p>
<p>夜雨翦春韭，新炊間黃粱。</p>
<p>客從遠方來，衣上壩陵雨。</p>
<p>城市不堪飛錫到，恐驚鶯語畫樓前。</p>
<p>篋有吳箋三百個，擬將細字說春愁。</p>
<p>若敎解愛繁華事，凍殺黃金屋裏人。（詠蠶婦）</p>
<p>遙觀正殿簾開處，袍袴宮人掃御床。</p>
<p>苦恨年年壓金線，爲他人作嫁衣裳。</p>
<p>平陽歌舞新承寵，簾外春寒賜錦袍。</p>
<p>東風不與周郞便，銅雀春深鎖二喬。</p>
<p>君自故鄉來，應知故鄉事。來日綺窗前，寒梅着花未？　　　妾有罗衣裳，秦王在時作，爲舞春風多，秋來不堪著。　　打起黃鶯兒，莫敎枝上啼。啼時驚妾夢，不得到遼西。</p>
<p>所謂「朕與先生解戰袍，」豈眞僅解戰袍而巳？乃舉此具體瑣屑淺顯的一事來暗示升官發財等重賞。又豈眞要皇帝親與解戰袍哉？說肯與解戰袍，則有重賞可知，不必眞解戰袍也。但抽象地說有重賞乏味；具象地說解戰袍，便有詩趣。同理，「齊解甲」就是齊受降，「解朝衣」就是辭官職，「解釣鱸魚」就是肯隱居的具象的寫法。詩人最懂得小中見大，個中見全的秘訣，最善於運用一伴具象的小事來暗示抽象的大事。言「安得萬里裘，」其救世之願可知。言「堂前燕飛入尋常百姓家，」其堂其人之廢逝可知。言「靑衫濕，」其悲哀可知。言「掃御床」，「賜錦袍，」其恩寵可知。言「鎖二喬，」其勝利可知。同時這些小事件因爲都是具象的，瑣屑的，淺顯的，故能給讀者一個確實，强明，生動，活躍的印象。讀了「共翦西窗燭」，「夜雨翦春韭，」便可想見故人久別重逢，燈下把酒談心的種種情味，如同身歷其境一樣。尤其是最後的三首五絕，整個兒是具象美。第一首但言「寒梅」，第二首但言一件「羅衣裳」，第三首但言要「打黃鶯」。而思故鄕，傷遲暮，懷遠人之情，强明地站出在這等小事伴的背後，深切地印象於讀者的心目中。</p>
<p>照藝術的領域說，音樂主聽覺美卽聲音美，繪畫主視覺美卽形式美，文學主思想美卽言語美。則現在所謂「具象美，」照理是繪畫的領域中所有的事。繪畫除了立體派構成派等以外，常含有多量的思想美卽意義美，而文學中亦如上述地盛用具象美。這可以看作文學與繪畫的交流，文學與繪畫的握手。我曾作一册「文學與繪畫」（開明版）說文學與繪畫的種種交涉，巳是二三年前往事了。現在又發見了上述的一種交涉，覺得往日的興味從新濃重起來。</p>

<p>（倫敦）此間官塲人士宣稱、美國政府對於該國輸往交戰國煤油數量、决定加以限制之後、國聯會對於禁運煤油輸往意國一層、自己易於着手、其决定之期當較預期者爲早、英國政府前此不欲要求國聯會從速進行此事者、蓋恐美國國會或在事後加以反對、茲美國行政當局旣已有所舉動、則局勢已屬不同、美國對於國聯會擁護和平所作努力、定可加以贊助、該國國會明年一月復會時、亦當贊成羅斯福總統主張、而允將煤油列入禁運物品淸單之內、至英國駐法大使克拉克昨日與法國賴伐爾總理會晤時、其談話內容、當係禁運煤油與英法兩國在地中海實行互助兩項問題、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間當局今日接得消息、謂意軍不久卽將佔領查那湖區域、査那湖爲藍尼羅河之水源、埃及蘇丹賴以灌漑、故佔領之後、英國將視意國爲破壞諾言、並破壞一七零六年劃分阿國經濟勢力範圍之條約、及一九二五年英意二國所交換之文件、並悉內閣全體會議已决定設法使國聯會員國家早日施行對意禁運煤油、外相霍爾且已向美國代請阿德登保證、謂制裁委員會大槪於十二月初卽將開會、以討論立刻對意禁運煤油之問題云、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國政府不准油船優列塞斯號載運媒油開往意國、美意兩國顯已發生爭議、惟外交方面今日猶嚴守秘密、消息靈通之觀察者今日相信、意國大使羅索曾爲此事向國務總理赫爾提出抗議、惟國務院及意國使館咸不願證實此項消息、某要員謂此事過於複雜、不能討論、此間外交家認爲卽此已是默認雙方已起爭議、美國運輸局長皮考克聲稱、一優烈塞斯號之地位並無更動、」足見美國之態度頗爲堅决云、（二十七日國民電）</p>

<p>（維也納）匈牙利總理貢博斯曁外長加尼亞、將於明日來此間、訪問休樞尼格總理、此間官方人士雖稱匈國要人來此、乃係一種交際性質、蓋奧匈兩國閣員隔相當時間、循例必相互聘問交換意見、然半官方面人士、則以爲奧匈兩國總理將商談兩國經濟情形、並擬就兩國對於制裁問題所採取之共同態度、有所商討云（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>南北路前綫　意軍同時退卻　深恐後方交通橫遭截斷　阿饒將攻入意屬索謀里　意軍新總司令抵菲</h3>
<p>阿京　今日阿當局宣稱、意軍已退棄瑪加爾、消息旣佈、數萬人民充斥道中、歡呼慶祝、內有許多、謂意人今巳覺悟食逾其量、同時據政府消息、駐瑪加爾之意軍昨日開始携坦克車大砲軍需載重汽車忽遽退走、滿集車站、開回伊利特里邊界附近之阿狄格拉特、（距瑪加爾五十哩）據被俘之土著軍官一人聲稱、意軍因前進過速、故不得不急退、教錯在未廓淸連丹比安在內之四周土地、而保其交通綫之穩固、遽行進攻所致云、（廿七日路透社電）</p>
<p>阿京　今日此間正式宣布、意國白種軍隊千人已自瑪加爾退往阿狄格拉、放棄先頭部隊之陣綫五十三公里、惟阿斯加里利種士兵則仍在該處駐守、阿人聞此消息之後、興奮異常、深信意軍係因「淸鄕」未能成功故不得已而退却、俾可在稍近意屬伊利特里之處鞏固陣綫、阿皇宮中某官員談及昨日所宣布意軍退出戈拉海及蓋洛戈比之消息、謂阿皇所稱阿軍力能戰敗意軍、確有根據、而羅馬所稱沃加登省已向意國降伏云云、則已證明不確、按阿方之消息如屬事實、則意國巳回復至去年十一月二十三日之地位、卽劃界委員在華爾華爾所定之界綫云、（二十七日國民電）</p>
<p>哈拉爾　南路阿將台斯太所統之軍隊、已攻入意屬索瑪里倫、現對意軍之交通綫作嚴重之威脅、據今日消息阿軍前鋒方諾部落之隊伍、現逼近意屬索瑪里亞要鎭伊斯西亞培杜亞、該地距索瑪里倫都會摩迦狄舒僅一百五十哩、聞阿軍主力現距先鋒隊西北不遠、據可靠消息、此奇將（台斯太）策白馬、率西杜摩部落之衆約十萬人、沿巨巴河流域直下、繼乃越邊而入意屬索瑪里倫、一路雖死於戰鬥或死於熱病者實繁有徒、但此軍如一巨蛇蜿蜓而進、卒達敵境、而使摩迦狄舒爲之震動、致意將格拉齊亞尼不得不由巨達高地分兵拒之、（廿七日路透社電）</p>
<p>阿斯瑪拉　新任東菲意軍總司令巴杜格略上將、已於今晨行抵瑪薩華、卽將到此、（二十八日路透社電）</p>

<h3>意軍後退原因</h3>
<p>阿京　本社特派員奧柴納訊、此間官塲對於意軍進攻査那湖一帶之說、表示懷疑、惟南路沃迦登區域與北路蒂格里省前綫意軍、同時退却、則在此間頗引起重大之注意、軍界人士探討意軍退却之確實動機、多謂由於蒂格里省前綫阿國軍隊攔擊意軍出沒無常、意軍深恐後方與前綫交通遭阿軍切斷、故不已而退却、至於沃迦登前綫意軍、則恐阿國駙馬德斯都將軍所部包抄後路、或攔擊意軍左側、故亦不得不退走云、至於一般人推測、則以爲意軍新任前敵總司令巴陀格里奧將軍抵前方後、戰略必將有所變更、目下阿軍正在齊齊加城至達伽蒲城一帶陣綫集中、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>阿王去一政敵</h3>
<p>（羅馬）阿國廢皇里德雅蘇、最近在押所去世、傳聞係飲有毒牛乳、慢性中毒所致、據蒂格里省前綫隨軍記者所稱、當里德雅蘇拘禁阿國京城時、其舊部曾謀設法越獄逃亡、其後意阿戰爭發生、里德雅蘇拘禁地點、更換至三四次、蓋恐或有意外也、今里德雅蘇已死、阿皇失一政敵、其地位自因而增强、（廿七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）巴黎周圍一百哩內之警備部隊今日淸晨開入京城、防範國會重行開會、或內閣傾覆時之騷擾（二十八日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）急進黨已贊助政府之要求於衆院開會時、先行辯論佛郎問題、故政府渡過難關之希望今日益見轉佳、第一次投票表决信任政府、政府必獲勝利、或可預決、左翼各黨今日集議、仍未商妥抵制政府之共同策略、（二十八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）衆議院定於本日午後三時復會、賴伐爾總理定於四時發表演說、依照向例、衆議院每次舉行重要辯論之前、各政黨必預行集議、决定態度、此次各主要政黨、業於昨日今晨分別開會、其在最後時間所作决議、足使賴伐爾內閣所處地位趨於穩定、其中右翼暨中央各黨已决定贊助內閣、急進黨在衆議院各黨派中、居於最重要地位、業於今晨舉行會議、獨立社會黨亦然、該黨雖决定贊成正統派社會黨之主張、要求衆議院立卽討論共和制度保護問題、（按卽取締法西斯團體問題）然後再議財政問題、但急進黨則以三十九票對二十八票（其餘黨員均未投票）通過决議案、贊成政府主張、首先討論財政問題、該黨領袖卽不管部閣員赫禮歐幷要求全體議員、一致投票贊成、該黨左翼份子雖有微詞、非所計也、此外衆議院左派各黨定於午後一時三十分舉行聯席會議、以兾决定同一態度、但反政府派之共產黨社會黨獨立社會黨與急進黨之間意見參差、未必能互相妥協、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）急進黨國會　黨團今晨開會時、該黨領袖不管部閣員赫禮歐發表演說、爲賴伐爾內閣作聲援、其言曰、「現內閣若果傾覆、則有三種可能之解决辦法、其一、卽組織「人民陣綫政府、」勢須解散衆議院、其二、卽急進黨單獨組閣、但在目前情勢之下、本黨中無人敢于單獨負責、其三、卽組織與現閣相同之新閣、又何必多此一舉」云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>北平　金融益形紛亂　商人憂不願收受中央角票　乘車購物銅元票不易兌現　平津發行新銅元票準備金念萬元</h3>
<p>北平通訊、北平因通州宣布自治、市面愈覺蕭條、金融界更爲不穩、又因天津自治敢死隊紛擾、銅元益形囤積、致有紙幣兌不出銅元之苦、一般小錢莊紙烟店、多囤積銅元、不肯兌現、當局亦未商得具體有效之取締辦法、東安市塲、西單商塲、勸業塲商店及一般小販、均不願接受角票與銅元票、甚至角票、亦不歡迎、電車上亦不願收受紙票、市民苦於無法兌現、徒喚奈何、金融界之紛亂、一至於此、平市當局雖擬澈底解决、將銅元標準價格、改爲每元兌換五百枚至四百七十枚、卽上海所謂五千文至四千七百文、使之有伸縮之餘地、但尙未决定實行、</p>
<p>其實北平銅元、並不缺乏、因行市較低、多數囤積商人、不肯售出、此項囤積鋼元之屬頗為複雜、電車公司茶葉油鹽店、均囤積零星收入之銅元、儂役走卒、見鋼元缺乏、亦設法零星收存、雖每人所存有限、而存者衆多、數量當然不少、因鋼元供不應求、價格高漲、但新鑄銅元又爲事寬上所不許、故只有發行新銅元票、使市面週轉靈便、則銅元價格自跌、而所積囤之銅元、當源源而出矣、</p>

<h3>近代科學發達簡史　（十一月十六十八日對全國中學生講）</h3>
<p>— （續）</p>
<p>（二）近代科學猛進的原因</p>
<p>近代科學史起自哥倫布發現美洲，前面巳經講過，新大陸發現以後不久的時候，葡萄牙人麥哲倫等就環繞全球一週，地圓學說，得以證明，於是歐洲人的思想觀念，大爲振作。除這以外，近代科學猛進的原因還有下面五種，茲特分述於後。</p>
<p>一·文藝復興——十四世紀至十六世紀爲歐洲的文藝復興時代，其最大的成功爲「人類的自覺」意思就是說：「我有耳目，不能絕聰明；我有頭腦，不能絕思想，我有良心，不能絕判斷」。不但科學研究的發達是這種精神的表現，就是宗敎革命的爆發，國語文學的產生，也無不受這種精神的影響。</p>
<p>二·科學方法的成立——根據考古家的推測，我們地球的存在約有二十五萬萬年，人類的歷史也有一百萬年，何以這一百萬年長時候的科學還沒有最近一二百年來的科學進步得快？這是因爲科學方法在十七世紀起頭的時候才完全成立。英人培根與法人笛卡兒反對當世所盛行的演繹法，而提倡歸納法。培根著新工具一書，即爲闡發歸納法的義蘊。他說我們應當先觀察天然的事物，以尋原理及原則；不當只憑主觀的理性，而一切事實勉强配合，培根的歸納方法共有三個步驟：（一）收羅所有事實而無遺：（二）取所有事實加以分析及比較；（三）發現各現象的原因。我再來舉個例子，將這方法的運用說明一下；有人看見塘裏面的氣泡由下上昇的時候，體積逐漸變大，因而問道氣體的體積何以爲變大？要解决這問題，第一步，收羅所有氣體體積變化的事實；第二小，就作分析及比較的工夫，因此發現了氣壓與溫度都能使氣體的體積改變；第三步，假定氣體分子間的距離可以改變，再用實騐方法來證明這假定是否正確。因而得着這個結論：氣體分子中間的距離是可因外面的壓力而改變的，塘裏的水，下面壓力大而上面小，所以氣泡由下向上升的時候，體積漸漸變大。這個結論是根據許多觀察與實騐，經過嚴格的批評與比較而得來的，所以比較可靠。笛氏的方法更進一步；他主張先將一問題分爲最簡單的因子，然後用培根的方法將每一因子作科學的硏究。培笛二氏的方法實在是科學發達的重要利器。</p>
<p>三·實騐精神的發展——科學方法須根據精密的觀察與實騐，否則結論殊不可靠。例如希臘大哲學家亞里士多德說：「兩種物體由上壓下，重者快而輕者慢。」照一般觀察，這種結論似乎是正確的，相傳二千多年沒有人能指出他的錯誤來，直到十七世紀伽利略才利用闢薩歪塔的高度，將兩鐵球，一重一百磅，一重一磅，同時下墜，證明輕重物體同時隊落，速度與重量無關，這實騐的本身是很簡單牠的出名也不在能指正亞氏的錯誤。這實騐能表揚伽利略實騐精神的偉大，在先伽利略發明落體三定律大家認爲同亞氏學說不符合，斥爲不經。伽利略竟敢不顧大衆的指責，率領羣衆來做「歪塔實騐。」他的實騐精神真是偉大，他因爲科學的主張，受當時教會種種逼迫，但他的志向與主張始終不改變，後人稱他爲近代科學的鼻祖，就是由於他的硏究與實騐精神。</p>
<p>四·大學與學會的林立——大柴供給研究學術的環境，學會使會員有切磋的機會，兩樣都能促進科學的發展。當近代時期的開始，歐洲各國大學已經林立，當時大科學家如歌白尼，刻卜勒，培根，伽利略，牛頓等皆受過大學敎育，並且是在大學或其硏究機關服務，各大學獎勵科學研究，所以科學得以猛進。歐洲學會發源於意大利的拿普里（Napler）。這是西方第一個科學學會，成立於一五六〇年。英國第一個科學學會成立在一六四五年，法國的第一個科學學會則成立於一六六六年。現在各國學會林立，爲促進科學的重要因素之一，果會比大學更加重要，因爲學會開會的時候，各會員先將研究結果提出報吿，然後大家加以討論，彼此辯駁問難，往往可以引起大家硏究的興趣，有時也可以指這個人硏究的途徑或校正他的錯誤，學會與大學合起來造成了優良的科學環境，造成了濃厚的硏究科學的空氣。</p>
<p>五·印刷術的發明與科學書報的繁盛！一在印刷術沒有發明以前，書籍多屬抄錄，或用刀刻於石木上面，價値昂貴，常人不易購買。自從德人在一四四五年發明活字板以後，不數年歐洲出版圖書即有萬餘部之多，這對於科學進步，自然有着極大的關係。到十七世紀中葉，科學家漸覺有互通消息的必要，於是各學會出版科學定期刊物，法英兩國於一六六五年同時有科學雜誌出版，科學雜誌的用途有三：（一）刊載各種硏究記錄和報吿，使別人研究同樣問題時，可以用作參考；（二）彼此互通消息，可以免除重複的弊病；（三）獎勵個人硏究與促進各科學家彼此善意的競爭，有人講「大凡一種科學的發明，需要十年的工夫，才得用作中學敎材，但是重要的發明，當天的報紙就有發表，至多一兩月內雜誌就有記載。」這話有相當理由，所以我順便的請諸位中學同學，踝外，多看報紙同科學雜誌，因爲現在科學的進步，决不是課本所能跟得上的。</p>
<p>上面五個因很是重要，我來講一個比喩以帮助諸位記憶，科學像火車的邁進；文藝復興好比鐵道使火車能猛力的大膽的前進，科學方法好比火車頭使火車有前進的技能，實騐精神好比煤炭是火車的原動力；硏究櫬關與學會好比火車本身載運着許多科學家，雜誌刊物好比信號如紅綠燈等，指示火車應行的路綫。這五樣倏件，經過一百五十年的時光才得齊備，以後科學就在軌道上向着光明的前途，加遠的猛進。</p>

<p>毛　綫製造業，乃毛紡織工業中之一部門　故毛　綫之製造，亦迄未為人注意，以致日用，在歐美日本等工業光進國家，此項工業，現所需之各稱毛　綫，殆全仰給外貨，據海關記載，近三年來，每年平均進口數額，均在六百萬金單位以上，無形中已成我國國民經濟上之一大漏　，年來實業救國之聲　起，有志之士，為補救此項損失計，乃開始自已設廠仿造，國內從事此項製造事業者，先是天津有東亞祥和二廠，上海有振興，章華，三廠，然此等工廠，多係利用其主要生產事業之餘暇而兼營毛　綫之製造，此外英商怡和紗廠，日商上海紗廠，亦附營斯業，去秋以來，上海毛　紡織廠，裕民紡織公司，與中國毛　紡織廠，先後成立，同時過去向以蜜蜂牌毛　綫載譽中國市塲之英國博德運　綫廠，為避免我國政府高度課稅，與便利競爭起見，亦於今年春來華設廠製造，於是毛　綫製造業，遂成為我國新興工業之一，記奢為明暸此項新興工業內容起見，乃於十一月二十一日，隨本館工商參觀團，前往最近成立之中國毛　紡織廠，一往參觀焉。</p>
<p>中國毛絨紡織廠，位於揚樹浦之臨青路，主事者為該廠經理陳兀欽先生，記者等抵廠時即由陳先生及協理畢仲英先生殷勤招侍，首先時均稱發達，惟我國百業落後，創辦近四十年介紹該廠創設之經過，據稱，訪廠之籌備，遠呢絨之紡織業，其製品迄今尚歎與外貨抗衡，在去年六月、主事者曾一度赴日本考察毛　製造事業，以資借鏡，惟日本各種工業，大都保守密秘，致首次考察之結果，僅知日本之毛　紡織業，係採用法國機器，與澳洲羊毛之大概情形，迄二次考察，方能略知其中底蘊，回國後，遂立即籌集資本二十五萬元，向法商德盛洋行訂購機器，聘請法國技師，同時選定地址，租建房屋，至本年九月，機器方裝置完竣，乃正式開工製造，從去年六月至本年九月，籌備時期，歷經一年有餘，機器裝置，約費時四月，工廠資本，實際上亦已擴充至百數十萬元</p>
<p>陳畢兩先生略述該廠成立之經過後，隨即領導記者等入工廠巡視一週，工廠之建築分為三部，前一部為毛　綫之紡織塲所，其中有拉綫車八部，錠子車五部，打綫車一部，併綫車一部，八部拉綫車之工作，總稱為前務，第一，二，三，部拉綫車，每車同時有（一）拉長，（二）拉細，（三）去污，（四）梳勻，等四種工作，原料毛條（竿毛之半製品）經過第一，二，三拉綫車後，逐漸成為細長均勻清潔之　綫，第四部拉綫車，除具有上列三部拉綫車之同樣工作外，並另增有一稱揉軟工作，此機乃最近所淅發明者，凡創辦較久之毛紡工廠，大都無此種設備，其售價每部約位國幣一萬九千元，第五，六，七，八部拉綫水，則僅具拉長與揉軟二種工作，因經過前四部拉綫車工作後之　綫，去污與均勺等工作，皆巳完成，以後四部拉綫車之工作，則以所需　綫之粗細，而決定其所應經過拉綫車之部數，拉綫工作完竣後，製造程序，旋即轉入後紡織段，後紡包括錠子車，併綫車，打綫車，三種機器之工作，先將經過該紡工作之　綫　送入錠子車，使其成為　綫欽子，然後再將錠子上之　綫，經過併綫車而成為合股之毛　綫最後，則經過打綫車使其成為成束之毛　綫。（未完）</p>

<p>學校因多數敎員假期旋里之故、不能實行假期作業、應由校供給家眷宿舍、以免全體敎員離校、農塲無人負責指導、校舍非常優美、恐不合農業學生生活、以養成適應環境能力、爲求學校設施完備計、應添設女子職業班、注意家政與農村家庭工藝之敎育、蓋該校附設之小學部男女同學、而初級農業部祗收男生、女子即失去敎育機會、甚可惜也、</p>
<p>十、省立錦堂鄕師初級農科　該科設初級二班、學生四十二人、近因投考人少、且對於農業訓練、易受師範空氣所影響、畢業生，亦多從事敎育、故巳暫停招生、農田百二十畝、菓園三十餘畝、除指定若干園地爲公共實習塲所兼事試騐外餘七八十畝、令每生承租一二畝、自耕自種自收、學校僅負指導之責、一切盈餘、補助學生費用、方法甚善、農作物成績尙好、暑假實習三週、伙食由校供給、各項設備除新式農具外、勉强够用、惟因敎員佔用房屋太多、致理化室圖書室及農具室、均形凌亂擁擠、該科可試將初農畢業學生、予以一年之師範訓練、或師範與農業並重、同時附設農民補習班、注意棉種之改良、不必停止招生、</p>

<h3>小男兒（一）（〇）（九）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>其時賴司務正坐了裝着乾草的車子過去聽到蜀夫人呌他就掉轉頭來。她要他送這全班人到那草原，到五點鐘去接他們。</p>
<p>『這免不了要躭遲你一些工作約時間但是不打緊：我們願意故了黑苺餅來酬謝你們」，蜀夫人又說道，她是曉得賴司務的弱點的。</p>
<p>他的粗黑焦黄的臉兒頓時發出光亮來，他愉快地笑着說道，「哈！哈！呀，裴太太你先允許了我這好吃的東西，我就立刻聽從了」。</p>
<p>裴夫人於是心中大爲釋然，便走回室中，對大家說道，「孩子們，我已經將一切安排好了。你們都可以去了』。她愛使他們快快活活，偶然驚動了他的小兒子恬靜的生活，便感覺十分苦惱；因爲相信成人們對於孩子們小小的希望，計畫和樂趣應予以同情的尊重，而不當加以粗率的阻止或誹笑的。</p>
<p>唐恩聽了，不勝歡喜，便問道，「我可以去嗎』？</p>
<p>「我特別想到你，要小心，也不要去管那些草苺，只是坐坐，好在你常能從你的四周找見你所心愛的東西便將它們來靜觀玩賞罷』，裴夫人回答道，她是分明記得他剛才表示對她孩子的一片好心的。</p>
<p>「我也去的！我也去的」！羅勃歡喜之極，載舞載歌，用馬口鐵手桶的蓋去撞擊那手桶，發聲恍如鐃鈸。</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市又遭挫折　收盤前由疲轉挺　結果尚跌二元餘</h3>
<p>紗市續挫、初因平津日軍、昨晨發生扣車紛擾事件、市塲人心震盪、賣風奇熾、一般浮多鑒於環境惡劣、斬結尤衆、賣方遑勢壓迫、市價乃呈不支之狀、午後聞豐奎日軍業已撤退、市氣頓見活躍而轉髙、終則仍落一元一角至二元四角、但銀行界及業外者之多頭仍不動云、</p>

<p>鄭標甬帮拋出</p>
<p>棉花前市開盤、各月一致狂落、形勢益覺驚虛、良以華北局勢突趨嚴重、賣風驟起、空方壓迫、市價步步下墮、惟美安洋行逢低大量吸收、甬帮拋出甚多、結果各月比上日收盤價均跌七角半、至八角、遠月敲破三元大關、午後開盤市况頗弱、賣風濃厚、各月續跌三角半、但拍至二三盤、外商繼續收進、同時北方消息轉佳、紗市回髙、市價由疲乏而轉挺、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一角至一角半、査賣出裕大二千二百擔、益裕一千五百擔、大孚二千五百擔、大豐二千一百擔、明華二千一百擔、賡豐三千一百担、元一二千七百担、長豐七千四白担、協成二千七百担、同和五千七百担、源興昌五千三百担、瑞源一千三百担、合興二千五百担、買進賡豐二千四百担、達記三千三百担、大豐二千三百担、梅記四千八百担、源大二千一百担、合興四千三百担、大昌成二千八百担、益昶五千担、潤康三千五百担、益康三千七百担、通記二千三百擔、信誠四千一百擔、永大一千二百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>刻石</h3>
<p>— 江京</p>
<p>不曉得是一種什麼因緣，孩子們很熱心地刻起石章來了。</p>
<p>孩子們對於新鮮的事物，都是有着非常强烈的興趣的。這興趣，在他們過着團體生活的時候就更被提高。這是一種得不到的東西麽，他們非想法弄到手不可。這是一件做不來的事情麼，他們非得要試試不行。那怕你冉三再四警吿他們這是一種愚蠢的或狂妄的舉動。</p>
<p>刻圖章，在字體還寫不正當的他們，自然是不會弄得好的。然而他們偏要刻，而且很熱心地刻。</p>
<p>自從我替了一個孩子在石頭上寫過字以後，所有在刻圖章的孩子，大家都曉得這回事了。正是寫不來字的他們，曉得有人可以寫字，那歡喜是能够猜想得到的。於是，「先生！替我寫寫」這類的聲音，合起來就成了巨嚮。</p>
<p>這種風氣，最初是在髙年級的孩子中間盛行。因爲去了一層寫字的困難，連低年級的孩子也跟着刻起來了。</p>
<p>寫字的總歸是我。我似乎成了廟裏有求必應的偶像。只要你一下課，他們不管你要不要休息，就爭着把石頭（多數是不曾磨平的石頭）伸過來，急口嚷着「替我寫寫！先生」！有的竟連「先生」兩字都來不及喊。</p>
<p>在吃過中飯到上課的當中，是大家都空着的時候。要寫字的孩子，就成羣地圍繞着你。學校里本有糾察隊維持秩序的，看見他們這樣擁擠，這樣呌囂，是要行使他們糾察的權威的。然而沒有用，一致的回答，幾乎全是「又不請你寫」幾個字。</p>
<p>字寫好了，就一個一個急急忙忙地跑開，一刻也不停留，拿起小刀就刻。上國語課也好，上算術課也好，這個敎室也好，那個敎室也好，總歸有那些不怕先生威喝的孩子，埋頭『在刻他們的圖章。</p>
<p>他們這樣瘋狂地刻了三四天，我也就被他們瘋狂地包圍了三四天。在這幾天內，以一百幾十個孩子的手，和五六百顆（每人平均至少有四顆）石頭，鋸呀磨呀，把弄堂里的牆壁，敎室里的檯面，到處都蒙上了雪白的石粉。——到現在，敎室里的早已拭去了，那牆壁上的，還當作他們這次盛大的熱情的活動的紀念而遺留着。</p>
<p>就在這活動最當高潮的時候，孩子們的厄運來了！他們的石頭統被先生挨桌沒收了。怨聲載道是不消說得的。然而沒收的先生也有理由：弄髒了牆壁，弄髒了檯面，有碍觀瞻：這還不算，連上課的時候都要雕刻，却是有荒學業，不能縱容的事。</p>
<p>經過這個打擊，孩子們是大大地掃興了。但仍然有些孩子偷偷地來請我寫，偷偷地在刻</p>
<p>現在，自己是沒有這種對事物的瘋狂的熱愛了，對於孩子們這次的活動，却感到很大的喜悅。我不斷地想着，如果有賢明的敎師，能够抓住孩子們這種寳貴的情趣，乘機引導，使他們拋棄這秤帶着「私佔」性的圖章的雕刻，轉向現實事物的雕刻，一定是有良好的效果的。或許在這些孩子們當中，能够陶養出一兩個羅丹那類的人物也未可知。即使不然，就是次等的，更次等的也好。</p>
<p>我一看到牆壁上石粉的遺跡，總覺得我的想念一定會得着眞確的證明似的，我是非常悵罔了！</p>
<h3>東京電影界雜寫</h3>
<p>— 方洵</p>
<p>在秋季開始的時候眞的映畫（電影）Season還不曾開始，但是那時候在一家小影戲院舉行的「名片週間一却充分地引起了我去看的慾望，不過一則因爲醫生不准進出人多雜踏的地方，二則因爲上映時間又和醫院的時間有了衝突，但是，在這一週裏面，我終於瞞着醫生去了兩次。日本電影院的規矩，是每次選映長片兩部，所以我所看的是在中國恐怕永無看到希望的德國片「夢裏香唇」（Der　Traumende　Mund）和法國片「外人部隊」（Le　Grand　Jen），和美國片金維多（King　Jidor）導演的「情聖」（Cynan.a）和「街頭小景」（Street　Scenca）。在「夢裏香唇」，我所想看的祇是Elizabeth　Bergner的演技，在「外人部隊」，要看的是Jack　Fede的導演，「情聖」曾在上海的蘭心看過，再看一次也不過是爲了Marion　Irances女士的編劇，而「街頭小景」，却是我在上海因事錯過而在兩年之內不曾重映過的渴望着的影片，果然，這是一張美國影片所僅有的傑作，看了這影片之後，使我重新去找Emer　Rriee作的劇本，有機會也許想將這劇本和電影劇本翻譯出來，我所看過的所謂文學電影裏面，這一片可算是最成功和最有異色的了。舉行這「名片週間」的，是一家很小的戲院，坐位也不過四百左右，當然沒有冷房和通風的設備，座價又是特別的公道，每票二毛，買一送一，所以結果化中國錢小洋二角，一共可看四張出色的影片。因爲是「名片」的原故吧，來看的都子智識分子，大部分對於電影有了外行人」以上的興味，所以開映的時候絕沒有談話聲音，也很有人拿了札記簿在暗中記錄他所感到有興味的塲面。</p>
<p>日本的電影院，在制度上實在和中國的有了很大的相差，除出上述的每一Program要映兩張乃至三張長片之外，大多都是繼續放映制度，祇要你不怕頭疼，出了一次票價，你儘可在裏面坐這麼九，十個鐘頭，他們放映的時候，除出禮拜日上午九十點鐘放映之外，大部分是每日正午放映，到下午十點半完結，你假使不願同看二片，那麽你儘可到下午八時以後去買「割引」（折扣）券，所以當上海的紳士淑女們Dinner　at　Eight之後，從容地在九點一刻左右到電影院去的時候，東京電影院的賣票和引客的小姐們早已經撲一撲臉上的粉，換一換衣服，而和她們所契合的朋友到銀座街頭去散步了。第三，是劇塲設備，從收容人數講，東京很有大規模的地方，如日本劇塲的二千九百五十八席，日比谷劇塲的一千七百席等等，但是他們的經營的標語祇是精密的選片，和殷勤的服務，除出這兩者之外，一些不必要花費，都是極瑞的節約，就是那日本人以「東洋第一」自誇的日本劇塲，講華麗和時髦，還得讓上海的大光明和國泰一步，再如新宿一流的「帝國座」，那可還不及中國映二輪片的麗都和光陸。從這些地方，可以看出中國人別的地方不講，在時髦和愛舒適之點，是充分可以說已紅站在世界之最頂點了。</p>
<p>在日本放映的美國影片，除一二例外，大都要比上海遲到半年以上，這原因也許是爲着要製日本版（就是在畫面上加印日本字幕）的原故，——最近更進一步，他們除出製日本版之外，還製成了「日本語版」，就是除去原來的音希，而再配上日語旁白，這一次，P.C.L.的試騐品羅克的Feet　ficel得了很大的成功，雖則「非同時」的地方很多，但是，那些巧妙地譯出了的對白已經充分地補償了這些缺點，往後，也許要出現個日本語似的時代吧。——但是在日本有一個好處，就是可以豐富地看到歐洲（蘇俄在外）的作品，不過，有一二在上海熱鬧的歐美電影，在日本竟遭了禁映的厄運，例如「英宮艷史」（The　Private　Life　of　HenryViii），「嘉塞琳女皇」（Kartherine　the　Great），「風流貴娣」（Madame　Du　Barry）等等，就是這一次在上海哄動過的「風流寡婦」，也遭遇了殘酷的剪禍，爲什麽對於這些上海人心目中認爲「無所謂」的影片要加禁止，這原因祇能讓聰明的讀者自己去惴度了。</p>
<p>對於日本電影，老實說我並沒有多大的期待，到東京之後第一次看的一部「急行列車」，又使我「不忍卒視」而中途退了出來，這是一部冗漫，混亂，連敘述故事都不能做到的極低劣的作品，導演，却是十年之前巳經「頗有聲名」的牛原虛彥！這樣的作品，祇要有相當設備，中國現有的最起碼的導演也可以做得出來，於是我對日本電影更存了一些不很恭敬的感想，可是在一禮拜前，因爲一般的報紙批評過分的恭維，終於又到上面說到過的「日本劇塲」去看了一部呌做「二人妻」的影片。在作爲一個藝術品看，這决不是値得讚揚的作品，但是單就技術和演技，這的確可以說是一部很像樣的到了世界水準的聲片。原作是通俗作家中野實，導演是成瀨已喜男，演員是前築地小劇塲的名優丸山定夫，英白台丫，和P.C.L.的新進千輩卓智子。（丸山和英兩位的名字，使我回想起愉快的東京時代，他在榮地扮演柴霍夫名劇「櫻桃園」中的洛伯欣的那種出色的演抜，那是到現在還是記憶得很淸楚的！）故事的內容，是寫一個男子在娶了一個女歌人的妻子和生了一個女孩之後，因爲性格不合而和他的妻子分開，後來又在北國和一個藝妓出身的女子結婚而生了子女，片子開始的時候前妻所生的女兒，已經到了訂婚的年齡，爲着要求父親出面辦理親事，所以自吿奮勇地到信州去尋找她的父親，在她預想裏面，以爲父親和他祥妻一定過着享樂的生活，可是到了當地一看，事實全和預想相反，她的後母是一個非常「賢淑」的婦人，不僅愛護丈夫，而且每月瞞着丈夫寄給在東京的前妻使用，她覺得不該從這和靄的家庭裏面奪去她的父親，於是等父親在東京替她辦好婚事之後就毫不代她母親挽留地一任她的父親回去。就故事看，作者的世界觀還是徘徊在明治後期和大正的初代，在現今，也可以說和軍部提倡的「賢妻良母主義」的婦道會的主張有一抹相通之感，在這兒導演祇是無定見地用前妻的女兒（看樣子應該是一個現代女性）的眼光去觀察明治時代的男女關係，他非特不加任何的批評和解釋，而竟很感盛地受了賢妻良母的感動而加以全幅的讚揚，這就是這影片祇能使人愉悅而不能便人銘感的原故。但是在演技，導演，尤其是收音機的驅使，我們决不能輕視他的成功，我不懂得，爲什麽有了這樣的物質的及人的環境，不製造出一些更髙度的作品？</p>
<p>除也P.C.L.之外，松竹，日活，和新與各有了國產的餘音機械，但是實質上，除出P.C.L.的差可勝過明星的機械之外，日活的和中國的三友式乃至中華通相仿，新興的Oriental　Sy-tem祇不過是一年前的中國自製收音機的程度而已。</p>
<p>為着「二人妻」這片影片，在細雨中差不多等了半個鐘頭，入秋以來，據說這「日本劇塲」遭遇了「殺人一般的景氣」，日本電影院大都售票不加限制，所以從有樂町經過的時候，常當看見「坐位已滿，祇有三位」的掙扎，但是買票的人還像長蛇一樣的蜿蜓。亦看見這劇本在的魔力的一斑了。</p>
<h3>晚清的「詩界革命」</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>晚淸時候在文學上有所謂「詩界革命」，那是和政治上的所謂「維新運動」相應而起的。換句話說，有政治上的維新運動，纔有文學上的維新運動。其實那個時候的詩界革命，只算維新，說不上革命。而且政治上的維新失敗，文學上的維新也失敗。</p>
<p>這話說來很長，只好扼要的來說罷。</p>
<p>文學上的維新派是由政治上的維新派譚嗣同夏曾佑梁啟超黄遵憲幾個人兼差。當然康有爲也屬於這一派，不過他最先只注意政治，政治上失敗後纔注意做詩，而且他較老成穩健，在詩上新到怎樣，究竟有限。</p>
<p>譚嗣同總算是維新派的第一位先鋒大將了。他沒有失掉湖南人的戇氣。他在政治上失敗，不肯逃走，這是革命家的叛逆精神，也是宗敎家的殉道精神。可惜他被殺了，他的所謂「新學」的詩，正和他的新政治的理想一樣，都沒有如他的素志。</p>
<p>夏會佑還沒有跑上政治舞臺，幸而不和譚嗣同同死，不幸而他在文學上的維新運動，再也不敢出頭。固然像他那樣的新學詩，只「挦搶新名詞」，「新約字面，絡繹筆端，」同伴如梁啟超，也說「無從索解」，便是他要再弄下去，此路不通，可想而知。梁啟超說是「當時在祖國，無一哲理政法之書可讀，吾黨二三子，號稱得風氣之先，而其思想之程度若此。」這倒是考實話。他們的維新運動，無論政治的，文學的，都歸失敗，雖說由於客觀的環境不許，主觀的力量不够，不能不說這也是一個大原因</p>
<p>戊戍政治上的維新運動雖說失敗了，因爲經過庚子八國聯軍之役，顓預的滿淸政府又想起舉辦幾件「新政」來。總之，經過甲午戊戍庚子三次很慘痛的經騐，政治上似乎又露了一點新的曙光。同時在文學上，不，在詩上，能够稍稍反映出這個慘痛時代的政治社會，能够作爲代表這一時代的詩，因此在所謂「詩界革命」上，還表現了一點點成績，就不能不推黄遵憲的人境廬詩草。</p>
<p>黃遵憲在政治上失敗以後，他就閉門讀書吟詩。他在當時算是一個稍懂國際大勢的新人物，他做過外交官多年，他到過日本印度南洋美國等地方。他是維新黨人中頂有見識頂有學問的一個，政治上旣不得志，把精力完全用在詩上，所以他在詩上的成就比同時任何人都大。梁啟超說是一近世詩人能镕鑄新理想以入舊風格者，當推黄公度。」這是不錯的。倘若嚴格說起來，他還只是詩界中的維新派，不是革命派。因爲他還在舊風格中兜圈子。不過他的詩料比古人稍豐富，他不僅偶然採用方言諺語，他還能够把「古人未有之物，未闢之境，耳目所歷，皆筆而書之。」只可惜他的耳聞目見有限，寫出來的又不算多。至於他說：「我手寫我口，古堂能拘牽。即令流俗語，我若登簡綢。五千年後人，驚爲古斑斕。」他自己並沒有眞正實踐他的這一主張。他的山歌九首，雖係摹倣民間歌謠的調子，也只是偶然嘗試。後來胡適之先生嘗試集裏的白話詩，似乎可以說就是實行黄遵憲「我手寫我口」的主張了。倘若我們要把黄遵憲作為「詩界革命」的先驅者，他是實在有先驅者的精神和魄力的。康有爲論詩，說是「新世瑰奇異境生，更搜歐亞造新聲，」實則他的詩也只是舊體，並非新聲，不算他把握住了這個瑰奇的新世界，環遊過世界，也是徒然。至於他說「意境幾于無李杜，目中何處著元明，」他不學元明人的詩，或許是眞的，不學李杜，他學不到，雖說他熟讀過杜集。有人把他和黄遵憲齊名並論，那是因爲他做過政治上的維新派首領罷。</p>
<p>當日黄遵憲的「新詩體」有名，梁啟超的「新文體」更有名。梁先生文名滿天下，却沒有詩名。他不歡喜作詩，却歡喜談詩。他在他的詩裏提倡愛國尙武，變法自强，民權平等，那是和黄遵憲及其他新派詩人大體相像的。他不在詩裏發牢騷，作呻吟語，愛說誇張個人的話，愛說積極進取的話，却和同時任何詩人兩樣。他說，「今日不作詩則已，若作詩，必爲詩界之哥侖布，瑪賽郎然後可。猶歐洲之地力已盛，不能不求新地於阿米利加及太平洋沿岸也。欲爲詩界之哥侖布，瑪賽郎，不可不備三長：第一要新意境，第二要新語句，而又須以古人之風格入之，然後成其爲詩。」這是他在一八九八年遊檀香山的時候說的，將近四十年了，今日看來，不免是淺薄的平常話頭，但在當時，却是另有一番意義。他知道要「竭力輸入歐洲之精神思想，以供來者之詩料。」他知道「中國非有詩界革命，則詩運殆將絕，」他知道「革命之機漸熟。」他在文學革命上，不能不算他是第一個先知先覺的人。可惜他幾乎把他的全副精力用在政論上，雖創了一種「新文體」，却不曾創出一種新詩體。要是他肯多做詩的話，像他那樣的才氣縱横，筆勢放恣，替自譚嗣同夏曾佑以來的所謂詩界革命，建立一點動續，比黄遵憲所建立的來得偉大，我想是可能的。</p>
<p>平心論之，這次的「詩界革命」，不能不說是失敗。可是在這一次失敗的經騐裏給了我們幾個很寳貴的敎訓。第一，他們原想「鎔鑄新理想以入舊風格」，換句話說，他們想把新內容裝入舊形式，結果，使我們知道形式不變，有些新的內客裝不進去。要表現這一個大時代的新現象新想念，是要創出一種新的形式，雖說舊詩體在某種情形也還有牠的用處。第二，他們究竟是士大夫，是智識階級，他們的「詩界革命」是爲了推進君主政治上的「維新」，爲了自己一個階層呐喊的；不是爲了大衆服務，他們的詩和大衆不相干，當然當日的大衆，較有覺悟的大衆，也不會擁護他們的這一運動。何况大衆的覺悟，還靠詩歌及其他的文學部門，乃至整個的文化敎育，共盡喚起之責呢！第三啥也們想採用和大眾接近的方言　語做詩，雖然不曾實踐，這一理論卻是正確的。</p>
<p>至於這一羣詩人的議論及其作品，在我編的：「中國近代文學之變遷」和「最近三十年中國了文·學史」兩部書裏都有引證介紹，這里就不贅了。</p>
<p>還有和這新派詩人站在相反的地位，可以作爲純正的舊派詩人看待的，有復古派的王蘭運。他說他的詩只是「雜凑模倣」，那倒不錯。他說「五十年來事事新，吟成詩句定驚人」。但他沒有吟詠當代新事的可以驚人的詩句。又有所謂「同光體」的沈曾植·陳三立等·原來同治光緒間的一些詩人，標榜學宋詩，學黄山谷王荊公一派的詩，成爲一時風氣，有人稱做「宋詩運動」，這一運動是開倒車，詩界革命運動却是進步的。開倒車的，做詩要模倣古時某一代某一派某一人；比較進步的，做詩就想採取近代歐洲人的精神思想做詩料，不妨自我開派。開倒車的，做詩要塡難字，造抝句；比較進步的，做詩想用方霄諺語，想用新名詞新語句。再有才子派的樊樊山，易實甫。他們的詩貪多鬥巧，賣弄風流。好疊韵得多，好對仗得巧，好捧戲子，好玩女人。他們過的是享樂的頽廢的生活，詩就是這種生活的紀錄，在舊派詩人中，只有他們最下流。總之，舊體詩經過這許多舊派詩人的灵作，把所有的壞處都暴露了出來。詩界革命運動能够支持下來，似乎還得靠他們帮忙，因此黄遵憲就成了晚淸唯一的大詩人了。</p>
<h3>薄暮登山小記</h3>
<p>— 沈聖時</p>
<p>夕陽的金光潑紅了山坡。</p>
<p>我們三個人全愛在薄暮時分爬山。</p>
<p>山坡上靜寂地沒一個遊人，在龐大山石間，我們三個彷彿三條小爬蟲似的。偉大的山之容姿，襯出生命的渺小。</p>
<p>一座座大山石，有如身材龐大的怪獸蹲坐在山坡上，靑苔斑痕爬滿了臉，攀爬上去，脚底裏滑瀉得不許自己作主，拉緊住一把把野草小心地爬上去</p>
<p>半途上我抱住一塊巨大的山巖，我傻傻的檢尋着，想尋出一點幾千百年來歷史的跡痕，然而石臉上僅留着粗糙的斑痕，是一臉風霜的蒼考。</p>
<p>我們一起爬到一個大石窟前坐下來休息，頭頂上是闊朗的天，窮望遠處，如薄霧的暮色從天四邊降下去，降下去，烟樹處托曳着紫暗的雲，漸漸地在混合起來·一片街市村舍，也沉在迷糊中。</p>
<p>夕陽收盡後，山風就有襲人的寒凉。</p>
<p>仰望髙峰上，怪大的山石重重疊疊的，擠馱在一起，山色翻出紫暗色，山風裏帶來一陣陰森的寒意。</p>
<p>暮色縈繞了山，一派陰寒逼近我們身邊。</p>
<p>在三個人痴痴的沉默中，我尋天邊漏露出來的星星。一點，二點，疎疎地。</p>
<p>趁天還沒黑盡就爬下去吧。</p>
<p>山上的夜，縈繞着陰暗深冷的思緒。一派陰寒碰到心邊。</p>
<p>一個朋友說：</p>
<p>夜的山，不適宜於一個平常人留住，月亮淡光裏，有神話裏翩翩的神仙出來夜遊，飄飄忽忽地，有三三二二的仙童到山坡上唱歌，這境界才是理想的幽美。</p>
<p>攀拉着樹幹革根爬下去，天巳暗，脚底下看不淸山路上突凸出的小石塊，一不留意就蹶鱉一下；大家呌呼着摸尋上來的跑徑，在不留意中一座座大山石蹲坐着有如大魔鬼似的攔障在眼前。</p>
<p>爬到山脚地方，大家額上全滲出了汗，脚心裏熱辣辣地。</p>
<p>回望山頂上，有一彎上弦月，從深藍的天邊慢慢移上來了。</p>
<h3>不繳制服　的兄弟二人</h3>
<h3>生活</h3>
<p>— 莫孚</p>
<p>生活是一個膠皮囊，倘若自已沒有點架子，它會縮得你緊緊的，以至想像不到的那末小的程度；同時它亦會被支撑到無限大，縱然中間是空的，使一般人摸不着邊際，揣測不透這之間究竟裝了些什麼寳貝貨色。</p>
<p>一個陰沉，寒冷的早晨，我依然躺在被窩裏胡亂想一些連自己亦不十分淸楚的事，一位久別的相識突然來了，同他離開此地時一樣，一些兒影踪都沒給我知道。</p>
<p>「啊！」他驚愕地髙呌一聲，彷彿看見甚麽怕人的，什麼。「以爲你早已走開這裏了，我原只是來碰碰看。……」</p>
<p>他一點也不容許我回話，直楞楞地返覆了幾次「你怎來過來？……」</p>
<p>「怎末過嗎？……一天二十四個小時。」</p>
<p>除此之外我不能够說得更具體，更多。</p>
<p>經他這末一詢問，倒當眞引起我思索這末一個問題——我究竟怎末過來者？自己確乎沒曾覺察。旣沒有可以生產的技能和機會，而且——這裏我想引用希臘詩人Marcus　Argentarins的一句詩「……什麽都沒的人，是沒有朋友的！」在這種情形之下，事先我决想不到會逗留如是長久，回憶起來，簡直是混沌的夢幻。肚子餓了，我生法到飯舖賒欠：房東討房租，我極力搪塞；而且竟然能在橋梆子的手裏哄到煤油；一西山紅煤一廠中騙（也許這字眼是最恰當，可是却是十分信任我。）來煤球；在什麽地方，雖是應當，却依然是意外地拿到幾許另用錢。於是一年四季……嚇，這是神蹟！</p>
<p>「將來打算怎末辦？」</p>
<p>「能怎末辦？……過一天算兩晌。」</p>
<p>略叙別後離情，他匆匆去了。所帶來的溫暖，復悉爲他帶去。我這小小房間仍舊冰凉。</p>
<p>呆站着。觀察周圍的什物，我笑了——我覺得我當眞笑了。</p>
<p>「反正還會生活下去，還要生活下去，有權利生活下去，……直到我應該生活的最後」。</p>

<h3>「志在救國」</h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>河北省灤楡區行政督察長員股汝耕，背叛國家，宣言獨立，成立所謂冀東防共委員會，自爲委員長，和國家脫離關係，這事件，此刻已由國府下令予以討伐了。然而據前日報載，股汝耕還對記者說，此舉爲「志在救國」云。這眞可謂「荒天下之大唐」。這也得自稱爲志在救國，那賣國和救國又有什麽分別？這樣解釋救國，我們眞會覺得救國不知從何處救起了。</p>
<p>賣國者本不一定會自稱賣國，儘可用通天的手段來賣國，然而他口中决不會朋白說一聲我是在賣國；而必有什麼很好聽的名詞或口實來掩飾其賣國行爲，甚至反會說是在救國。這是古今中外的通例。鄭孝胥實實在在在做着他人的奴隸，然而他决不肯承認自己是在做奴隸，也許他會說這是在「忠心前朝一，要「拯斯民於水火」呢。做賊的人會自己說做賊嗎？任是他實際的行動是怎樣的可恥卑劣，然而他口上却不妨說得儘漂亮的。殷汝耕不過此類人中之一個罷了。而且，比起其他的大漢奸（如鄭孝胥等）來，他還眞是不足道呢！</p>
<p>然而這班人的無恥與卑劣，因他口頭上的善於掩飾，他們的眞相，就會永遠不被我們發現嗎？也不然的。這要看這班人事實上的行動，是否和口頭相符。殷汝耕儘管髙唱「志在救國」，然而他所幹的勾當明明是賣國，這豈是編得人的。救國要拿事實來！賣國的勾當，任是怎樣掩飾，人家還是看得很淸楚。現在有誰會相信殷汝耕確是「志在救國」？人的眼睛是亮的！</p>
<p>世間儘多和殷汝耕同類的人在活躍於我們眼前，所可惜的，國府討伐的明令，僅及於殷汝耕一人，我就不禁爲殷汝耕呼寃了！</p>
<h3>議親（續）</h3>
<p>— 沈千里</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>「哈哈，倒底是母女就不同，有了私房話跑到外面去說呀！」</p>
<p>「你跑到那來，雲兒？」面孔綳緊得像一面鼓。</p>
<p>「潤翁！你要嚇壞了她，可不得了呀！」磔磔地笑了。</p>
<p>「不，我倒不是和她說的玩話；」還是一本正經地，臉上沒有一絲表情，像父親敎訓兒子似的：「我老實和你說，你願意嫁給我就乾脆地死了這條心，不許和那個窮小子來往：不然的話，你媽還欠着我二百塊錢，我拏到什麽地方都不愁娶着女人……」</p>
<p>「算了罷，潤翁！別嚇了她；像她這麽一位花一樣的大姑娘，那裏還會那些窮小子勾搭呢？唉！我還說你這人是陸地神仙，你這未免比神仙太操心了……」說話的人嬌小的眼睛斜晲到紳士的臉上，見他不爲自己的話所動，便也不再說下去了。</p>
<p>「這是你媽在這裏，我娶你總不叫你受委屈，」呷了口熱茶，接着噓的一聲，那一股烟草味使得立在距他不遠的雲英意識的往後退了一步；他似乎沒有覺得，仍就一本正經地說下去：「起初和你媽說的是：你應允嫁我，兩百塊錢我就不要她還，另外還現找一百塊錢做聘禮，從此我們便是親戚來往，她沒有事就相帮我一點，在我家裏吃一碗閒飯。我這種主意，總不見得不合你的心意能？」臉上閃了一點兒笑容，但等雲英抬起頭時，便又馬上收住了。</p>
<p>「潤翁！眞是風情老手，設想得「無微不至」，我們眞是自愧不如！哈哈…」</p>
<p>潤老爺做的事，是不會錯的，祗是怪我生苦了命，就養這麽一個女兒：」眼晴裏藏着的兩包淚水，偸偸地流着。</p>
<p>「就祗這一個女兒，也沒人吃她，哭的什麽？」話是像刀一樣的截斷了她的哀訴。「不是說怕人吃，她跟了潤爺還有人敢摸她一根汗毛麼？我是說她今年長到十七歲了，從來就不曾離開我一步，什麽事，也不懂，怕她將來不會服侍潤爺，又惹你生氣！」聲帶像斷了似的忍不住抽泣起來。</p>
<p>「媽，你答應人家還哭什麽？好歹碰命罷了！」斜對着紳士飛了一眼，像鐵那麽地堅强。</p>
<p>這時，他不自主地一骨碌跳下牀來，握住了她的一隻胳膊，把一張乾癟的往她臉上凑上去；骨頭都軟了半截似的，彎着腰把她緊緊地摟着：「好人，你媽怎麽替你裝上這麽一張利嘴？我滿肚子的氣就給你幾句話趕走了：快過來，不要再嘔我：來，來香一個，香一個……」</p>
<p>「不，不行，這成麼樣兒？」頭臉蜷曲得像刺蝟似的，兩隻手緊緊地捧着。</p>
<p>「好了啊！潤爺！逼很了她要發脾呢！一顆淚珠在話聲當中落了下來。「哈哈…女兒到底女兒，女婿就要不同點…」又是一陣轟笑。（完）</p>

<h3>雪</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>在去年的冬天，我居住在一個小城裏。那兒成天被嚴寒包圍著。早晨打開窗望出去，一片白芒芒的雪野展開了。對着這坦白的雪野，憂鬱地心馬上換披上一層的快的調子。</p>
<p>我和一位朋友居住在一間三層樓上。這幢房子是一家親戚的別墅，在城外。他夏天移居此地，冬天就仍舊住在城裏的住宅裏。我從大學裏下來，找不到職業，親戚的意思，是叫我住在這兒玩好了，反正那時家裏還沒破產。我就和這位朋友住在一起了：他從北平回到這小城，也很寂寞，在一起，也許好些，——各人辦各人的事，沒事辦了就在一起玩。</p>
<p>但是我們實在沒有事情作，我們大概半把時間消磨過去了。</p>
<p>早晨我正預備寫一封信，給我在上海的哥哥，他進來了。穿着一身杏黃色的晨衣，坐在沙發上。他不愛說話，雖然大家在一起，談起話來就沒有多少；比方說他成天看報紙，我就不看。實在說，報紙我是沒有看的勇氣的。每天，孰是在這小城，搶案時常地發生着。消息是會叫人生病的，看他作什麼呢？他却一定要看報。</p>
<p>『昨天槍斃了十四個！都是年靑靑，——只有一個是五十歲的老頭！」</p>
<p>臉擺得很平穩，像一杯無波的白水，他好像來打動我的心似的，其實，我是不愛聽極了，而且這種成了俗調的消息已經失去了刺激性，在我的平板的腦膜上，再也不會被他感動了。我看着他的臉，點了點腦袋隨手他娘姨放好的兩杯牛奶推給他一杯。</p>
<p>「快要凉啦，——吃下去出去跑跑吧，今天雪景很好啊！」</p>
<p>他也許是看出我不高興聽這些了吧，話沒下說。我吿訴他，在這時代裏，我們也不過是個配角，一點兒也不重要，世界，隨他變去吧，變成無論怎樣的世界，我們這些沒有用的人。將依舊還是沒有用。而且，像他這樣沒有勇氣的人，更是不要担憂的我很清楚這世界。大學課程中曾經讀到了。但是，我乃然是作一個配角。我不願去作一個主角，去担當這時代的改變的任務。他聽了我的話，又被我說着，牛奶飮下了：對我說：</p>
<p>「還有一個消息，對你有點關係！</p>
<p>「還有對我有關係的消息？走吧！」</p>
<p>我毫不在意地對他說。於是，我們在雪野裏聽着寂靜地發出的聲音回首，一條脚印長長地隱沒在白色裏了。對着這發亮的雪，望着遠樹，和海藍色的天空，我唱着一首雪萊的詩，他唱着海涅的「鬭爭頌」聲音高亢而興奮，使我驚服他那不常說話的喉嚨。</p>
<p>在雪裏爬山是最有趣的。像一個人在血泊裏尋覓自己的路。我們爬山，上樹，一個上午過去了。身上流着熱，充滿了熱。</p>
<p>歸途上，我到另外一位朋友家裏去了，他自已回去的。</p>
<p>我回家的時候，天已經黄昏了。遠處的山影依稀在白色裏。</p>
<p>娘姨送給我一封信：</p>
<p>「老張：我走了，你說我沒有勇氣，試試看。也許會有的。</p>
<p>這裏有關於你的消息一條，希望你看他？</p>
<p>以後見。祝你發福。金。』</p>
<p>「什麼時候給你的？」</p>
<p>『今天下午。』</p>
<p>我坐在沙發上，看那條報紙，是說我哥哥在上海的那家銀行倒閉了。還有一條說這幾天倒處都很吃緊：年關已經迫近，倒閉倒閉，槍斃，到處都是。</p>
<p>他就爲了這走了嗎？是的，他就爲這走了。第二天我就接到哥哥的電報。說預備卽時回這小城避避風。但是，第二天的報紙上却說他已被扣押。</p>
<p>我也就離開那地方，到這裏來了。在這裏的生活，沒有了牛奶，娘姨，我在「生活」。</p>

<h3>上午</h3>
<p>— 彬</p>
<p>妻帶了菜籃到灶下去，把孩子放在房里。最近失業了，閒在家里，就把一架舊書橱搬出來，里面都是自己所喜歡的書，但是貿來後從沒有功夫翻過幾頁。現在一天到晚獃在家里，就想從這里面發掘一點新的智識，作爲朱業後的精神上的補償。但是早上妻買了菜回來就到灶下去做菜，孩子關在這間狹小的臥室里，到處闖禍，不是摔壞了東西，便楚自己跌到了放聲大哭，簡直沒有數分鐘的安靜使我好翻讀幾頁書。爲了這樣，我將地買了一堆廉價的玩具，由他獨自玩耍；最近幾天果然由於這些新的東西，孩子安安穩穩在一角落弄着玩具不作聲了。但是這幾件廉價的玩具，三五天後，已是一堆不堪入目的垃圾了，孩子就恢復了常態。今天又是這樣吵鬧着，我把他打了一頓，但是妻聽了哭聲跑上來嘮叨了。她那樣怒氣勃勃地說我不中，一個男人家不會賺錢，反一天到晚獃在家里打孩子，後來竟是說出嫁了我這個男人是她的倒霉。一股子勁抱着孩子下樓去了。</p>
<p>失了業，親戚，朋友都連帶着失了人類與人的間那種互助的關係。獃在家里，自然不是自己所願意的，但是我已不能享受那份拜訪親戚朋友的資格了。他們一碰見你的面，好像你的面色吿訴他們是借錢來的，於是在你沒有啟口之前，就可以聽見一連串的市面不景氣呵，生意難做呵，把臉孔綳得緊緊地，彷彿馬上有禍事降臨到他們頭上似的，使你如坐針氈不好意思揩油他一頓飯。自己明白這層做人的藝術，這個窮倒底還屬於自己的，讀一點書比較獃在朋友家里聊天總有意思，而女人家却有她們的不可理喩的道理，這又是我第一次的新發見。</p>
<p>不過事實擺在面前，在這個以經濟關係維持着秩序的社會中，一個丈夫就負有妻子生活的義務。失業後老獃在家里翻破書，就顯得不識時務了。於是我戴上呢帽，跑上馬路了。</p>
<p>已經是冬天了，道旁的注梧桐都禿了頂，太陽灑着我的薄薄的棉袍感到一種親切的暖意。溜過了幾道馬路，我思索着可以到一個坐坐的地方去，那個地方不要把我看做一個不識趣的討債鬼。腦海里像翻着一冊記錄簿一樣，把我所認識的親戚，朋友，一個個都翻遍了，但是當他們那付難看的嘴臉在目前浮現的時候，我慷慨地又一個個把他們拋棄。最後由於一所學校的啟示，我逕向一位從前的敎授家去了。</p>
<p>在學校里，那敎授是十分賞識我的一個，他常常喜歡我到他家里去談天，敎授夫人知道我是她丈夫的得意門生，史是特別殷動招待，卽是敎授不在家的時候，她留着我吃飯，聊天。我幾乎像發掘了寳藏似的去按那小洋房的門鈴，來開門的正是敎授。他見了我，推了推那付無邊的眼鏡，一個孩子那樣地把我抱進門去，同時高聲喊着她妻子的名字。敎授眞是十分高興，他說他很掛念我們同班同學，師生之間在學校里還得維持一層做尊嚴，畢業後應該像老家那樣時常來往的，他一口氣說了許多話，這些話我最近幾個月來沒有從任何人那里聽到過。在敎授夫人踏到會客室里來的時候，他開始問我的近狀了。我的答話使他獃住了，他又下意識地推了推眼鏡說：「智識階級的末路啊，智識階級的末路啊！我沒有見過一個我的學生像我所希望的那樣在社會上獲得地位，怪不得學校里的學生每年减少下去，普及敎育，眞是談何容易！」敎授感慨地在客堂內徘徊着。</p>
<p>敎授夫人吿訴我：學生每年减少，學校經費不敷支出，已經欠了三個月薪了！我望望敎授的臉，那張長了的臉，我忖着應該走了，我不需要牢騷與同情，這個社會，或者說這個世界上已沒有我可以坐坐的地方了。</p>
<p>回到家來，孩子爬上來桌子用手指抓着菜吃，太陽已經高掛在頭頂上，上午過去了，下午呢？還是那一連串跟在你背後的日子呢？</p>

<p>(Beiping) Yesterday morning, more than 90 Japanese soldiers departed from Beiping for Fengtai, staying in Fengtai for a day and night to inspect traffic on the Beining and Pinghan Railways and prevent freight trains from heading south. Passenger trains on both lines heading south and north ran as usual yesterday and today. Only through freight trains were temporarily suspended. After our side negotiated, more than 80 of these Japanese soldiers were ordered to return this morning, leaving more than ten people in Fengtai to clean up miscellaneous items. Also, yesterday afternoon, dozens of Japanese soldiers from the Guang'anmen Railway Station occupied the station platform, office rooms, and freight yard, inspecting all vehicles heading south. These Japanese soldiers also returned to their teams this morning. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Trains on the Beining and Jinpu Railways ran as usual on the 28th. Japanese soldiers did not interfere at the stations. The two railway bureaus are responsible for not transferring train cars to head south. Regarding the allocation of trains by the two railways to transport military supplies, the Deputy Director of the Beining Railway, Lu Mengneng, and the Director of the Jinpu Railway's Tianjin Office, Gao Hengru, are currently in discussions with the Japanese side to formulate a separate method to avoid misunderstandings during loading and unloading. As of noon on the 28th, more than 40 Japanese soldiers stationed in Fengtai had withdrawn back to Beiping, leaving only more than 20 people at the station, living in local houses near the station. Today, Japanese soldiers did not monitor the transfer of through trains on the Pinghan and Beining Railways. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the afternoon of the 28th, a Japanese squad leader and four soldiers from the Jinpu Railway's Tianjin Main Station were stationed to monitor the railway traffic. This did not yet obstruct railway operations. (28th Dispatch)</p>

(28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) After the Japanese army forcibly occupied Fengtai, traffic on the Pinghan Railway continued as usual. Passenger and freight trains headed south and north today without any obstruction. Revenue along the entire line remained strong. However, through transport between Pinghan and Beining has been virtually suspended due to train car issues. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Japanese Consul-General in Nanjing, Suma, visited Vice Minister Tang at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:10 am on the 27th, offering an explanation for the actions of the Japanese army at Fengtai and Zhangyimen Railway Stations. He left an hour later. (28th Dispatch)</p>

More than ten people remain stationed to inspect the station. Japanese soldiers at Guang'anmen Railway Station have all been withdrawn. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Japanese military authorities withdrew the Japanese troops stationed at Fengtai and Zhangyimen Railway Stations this morning. According to the Japanese military spokesman yesterday, the Japanese troops occupied the two stations to protect traffic and prevent trains from moving south. The sudden withdrawal is unexplained. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the Jinpu Railway traffic was temporarily suspended, negotiations began and have now been settled. Passenger trains can run as usual, but freight trains heading south must return to Tianjin. For surveillance purposes, the Japanese army has dispatched a team of Japanese soldiers to be stationed at the Jinpu Railway Station here. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Today, the Japanese military spokesman answered inquiries regarding the Japanese army's occupation of Zhangyimen and Fengtai Railway Stations, saying that the Japanese troops there had withdrawn this morning, but a few remained to monitor the traffic of vehicles. The withdrawal of Japanese troops from Fengtai and Zhangyimen is seen by the people of Beiping as an unexpected move. Yesterday, the Japanese military spokesman stated that the occupation of the two stations was aimed at protecting traffic and preventing vehicles from moving south. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Japanese Troop Movements</h3>

<h3>Cheng Ke Visits Song Zheyuan to Discuss the Issue of Public Security in Tianjin – The Beiping Military Affairs Commission is Being Wound Up – He Yingqin Sends a Telegram to Song to Urge Him to Stay – Several Japanese Planes Will Fly to Tianjin</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Cheng Ke came to Beiping from Tianjin last night and visited Song Zheyuan this morning to discuss the issue of public security in Tianjin. Cheng said that the public security in Tianjin has recently been very important. The municipal government has received a telegram from the Executive Yuan ordering the police and security forces in Beiping and Tianjin to be under the control and command of Song. A Japanese air force chemical warfare unit has recently arrived at the Tianjin Wanguo Sports Ground, and it is rumored that 50 Japanese planes will fly to Tianjin within a few days. According to the Japanese side, this is because a large-scale exercise is being held in Tianjin, but its intentions are unpredictable. After a small disturbance occurred in Tianjin a few days ago, residents in the suburbs were alarmed and moved back and forth, and order seemed to be disrupted. Therefore, the public security in Tianjin must be discussed with Commander Song to be effectively maintained. The public security in Tianjin has been properly arranged during my visit to Beiping, and there is no need to worry. I will leave Beiping and return to Tianjin soon. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Cheng Ke said that the activities of ignorant people in Tianjin have recently been eliminated, but the crisis is still there. Before I came to Beiping, I had already made careful arrangements with Liu Yushu on public security. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the Beiping Military Affairs Commission was ordered to be abolished, it has been winding up its affairs in recent days and can be completely completed by the end of the month. The commission has specially sent the ninth group leader, Shen Zhenrong, to Beijing to meet with He to report on the winding-up situation. Shen is scheduled to leave Beiping for Beijing today or tomorrow. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 28th, the city of Tianjin returned to calm. There are fewer people moving from the Hebei area. The stores and night markets in the Nanshi area have resumed. The municipal public security bureau's announcement dispelling rumors and prohibiting relocation has taken effect. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan telegraphed He last night to resign from his new position, but as of noon today, he has not received He's reply. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Telegrams from Song Zheyuan and Shang Zhen arrived in Beijing yesterday reporting on the public security in Beiping and Tianjin. Song telegraphed Minister He the day before yesterday, expressing his humble resignation from the position of Director of Pacification for Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan. It is heard that after various parties telegraphed to express their comfort and encouragement, his intention to resign is expected to be withdrawn. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Song Zheyuan humbly resigned from his position as Director of Pacification for Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan, and telegraphed He Yingqin to request that he withdraw his order. He replied with a telegram of comfort on the 28th. The original telegram stated: (Title omitted) "At this time of national crisis, we rely on the collective wisdom and strength to jointly plan for salvation. The intention of the Chairman and the Central Government is that I hope you will exert yourself to overcome difficulties, take office on a specific date, and not decline again." (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) After the Military Affairs Commission was ordered to be abolished, it is handling the winding-up. On the 28th, the ninth group leader, Shen Zhenrong, and others were sent to Beijing to request instructions from the Military Affairs Commission on handover matters. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Cheng Ke visited Song Zheyuan on the morning of the 28th to discuss the issue of public security in Tianjin and decided to return to Tianjin on the evening of the 28th or the morning of the 29th. According to Cheng, after the Central Government telegraphed that the Tianjin police and security forces were under the command of Commander Song, there were many issues regarding public security that needed to be discussed. Therefore, he came to Beiping to negotiate. Residents in the suburbs of Tianjin and the Chinese concession are mostly moving back and forth, and people seem to be feeling panic. At present, public security is still not a concern, but those who are not ambitious are still thinking of making trouble, and strict precautions are being taken. After I negotiated with Tada regarding the Japanese army's detention of trains at the Jinpu Railway Station, Tada stated that it was a misunderstanding, and now traffic is normal and unobstructed. The Japanese Air Force and Chemical Warfare Equipment Team arrived in Tianjin yesterday and set up a parking lot at the Wanguo Sports Ground. It is rumored that forty to fifty planes will fly in within a few days. According to the Japanese side, it is holding exercises and has no other intentions. As for the current situation, the Japanese side has never made any formal statement. (28th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Although the situation in Tianjin is still peaceful, it is still serious. The police station issued a notice to reassure the people today, stating that the authorities will do their best to maintain public order, and those who spread rumors will be severely punished. On Sunday, the police quickly put down the rioters, which has won praise from the general public. A certain anonymous Chinese person donated 1,000 yuan to reward those who contributed to the efforts. The Japanese military authorities here have installed a telephone in the East Station to connect to the Japanese military commander and Tanggu. There were no Japanese soldiers here today. Seven hundred arrived yesterday, but half have gone to Beiping. There are currently empty cars being detained in both Beiping and Tianjin for the use of the Japanese army. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Yin Tixin in Tangshan – Discussing Methods for Remitting Taxes – All Agencies Have Virtually Stopped Operating – Postal and Telegraph Services are Subject to Inspection – Su Yuqi Has Resigned – Yin Rugeng Flees to Yutian – Beining Railway Bureau Issues Circular to All Stations Prohibiting Acceptance of False Orders – Zhang Qingyu, Zhang Yantian, and Ge Shi Have Not Participated in the New Action</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Tangshan phone call: After Yin Tixin, director of the Anti-Communist Office of the Jidong Autonomous Council stationed in Tangshan, arrived in Tangshan, he immediately summoned the magistrates of various counties in eastern Luan, including Chen Zengshi, the magistrate of Luan County, and Zhang Renli, the magistrate of Fengrun County. In addition to announcing the significance of autonomy, Yin also discussed methods for remitting taxes. Postal and telegraph bureaus in Tangshan have people permanently stationed to conduct inspections and allow delivery only after stamping. There are also people monitoring the tax bureau. Most agencies have entered a state of suspension. Taxes are remitted to the Tangshan Office. The Tangshan Security Team, Zhao Lei's department, dispatched a company to the city on the 27th to suppress the situation. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Lu Qiu, formerly known as Zhenhuan, the director of the Xin-Yu section of the Beining Railway under the puppet Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee, served as a secretary in the Beining Railway Bureau and later as the head of the General Affairs Section of the Ao-Yu Commissioner's Office. Although he took office in Tangshan on the 26th and announced the establishment of a puppet organization to all stations, Lu is observing the situation with caution, as the Central Government has ordered the strict arrest of Yin Rugeng, and has not yet taken over the railway. On the 28th, the Beining Railway Bureau issued a circular to the station masters and railway staff in eastern Tianjin, telling them to work in peace, not to believe rumors, and not to accept any false orders. Also, the bureau has not yet received instructions after reporting the puppet organization to the Ministry. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The magistrates of Changli, Leting, Lulong, Qian'an, and other counties in eastern Ao refused to join the puppet Jidong Anti-Communist Committee and quietly left their posts one after another, heading to Baoding to report to the provincial government. The affairs of the counties are at a standstill, temporarily maintained by section chiefs and others. The Tangshan Office of the puppet Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee is preparing to send people to take over. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Among the county magistrates in the war zone who have defected, Zhang Renli, the magistrate of Fengrun County, and Chen Zengshi, the magistrate of Luan County, are the most prominent. All agencies with the words "Hebei Province" in the county have been cancelled. The rest of the county magistrates are observing the situation. Yin Rugeng transferred from Tongzhou to Yutian on the 28th, protected by a certain foreigner, to prevent personal danger. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Zhang Qingyu and Zhang Yantian, the commanders of the first and second security brigades in the war zone, went to Tong County and the Liushouying defense area respectively on the 28th.

The salaries of their units for August have been issued by the provincial government. (28th Dispatch)</p>

On the 27th, Yin Rugeng sent Wang Zhi to Yu Guan to investigate various Central Government agencies and planned to take over the local public security bureau. The Tangshan and Qinhuangdao postal and telegraph bureaus are being monitored by members of the puppet organization, who are stationed there permanently and conduct strict inspections. Although the tax collection agencies have been taken over, they are equivalent to being at a standstill. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yu Guan reports that after the director of the Yu Guan Public Security Bureau, Su Yuqi, resigned, no one is responsible for the bureau's affairs, and most of the staff have left, resulting in a standstill. It is now being continued by personnel sent by a certain party. The puppet Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee in Tong County sent official Wang Zhi here on the 27th to inspect postal and other agencies in preparation for taking over. Some county magistrates in the war zone have left their posts, and the Tangshan Office of the Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee in Jizhou is about to send personnel to take over.

<p>(Beiping) After the Yu Guan Public Security Bureau was taken over by the puppet Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee, it recently issued a notice declaring that it would implement autonomy and break away from the central government. The county magistrates of the five counties of Linyu, Changli, Leting, Lulong, and Qian'an in the war zone all left their counties one after another on the 27th to report to the provincial government because they were unwilling to participate in Yin Rugeng's Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee, resulting in a standstill in the five counties of Linyu and others. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Tongzhou Telegraph Bureau is now ordered by Yin Rugeng to have personnel from the First Security Brigade stationed at the bureau to inspect incoming and outgoing telegrams. According to the Beiping Telephone Bureau, the Tongzhou branch has been monitored by telecommunications officers sent by the Commissioner's Office of the Jizhou-Miyun District. Currently, all telegrams sent to Sanhe, Pinggu, Jixian, Xinglong, Xianghe, and Baodi are being detained. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Among the 22 counties in the war zone, as many as 15 counties are now opposed to Yin Rugeng, which is clearly against the will of the people. It is expected here that it will disintegrate soon. (28th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Baoding) After Gu Rugeng started the rebellion, the provincial government and various departments still send documents regarding the war zone as usual, but because Yin has isolated himself from the people, they are sent directly to the county magistrates. (27th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) An official of the Jidong Autonomous Government issued a statement today declaring his withdrawal from the organization. The telegraph bureaus in the non-stationed areas are still managed by central government personnel, but the autonomous government has sent people to supervise incoming and outgoing telegrams. Yin Rugeng appointed a certain Lu, the former station master of Qianmen Station on the Jinpu Railway, as the director of the Tangshan Bureau. Lu has issued a notice stating that all station masters between Lutai and Yu Guan must report everything to Tangshan, but no one has complied so far. (28th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Reading the Declaration of the Beiping Cultural and Educational Circles</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>More than twenty figures from the Beiping cultural and educational circles, including Chiang Meng-lin, Fu Szu-nien, Hu Shih, and Chiang Ting-fu, recently issued a declaration stating, "We resolutely oppose all conspiracies and actions that detach from the central government and establish special political organizations. We demand that the government use the power of the whole country to maintain the territorial and administrative integrity of the country." The language is extremely concise, and a spirit of integrity naturally flows from the words. Today, when the so-called "Jidong Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee" has already appeared in North China, reading it feels particularly inspiring. The demands of our people, though numerous, when measured to the lowest and most minimal extent, and what must be fulfilled, are only the few words mentioned in this declaration.</p>
<p>Most intellectuals are fond of engaging in empty theories. When they comment on current affairs, "China" and "China" are constantly on their lips and in their writings, accompanied by reckless accusations and endless criticisms of shortcomings. Listening to their words and reading their articles leaves people scratching their heads, at a loss as to what to do. Yet, they remain aloof, as if they do not belong to any nationality. To conceal illness and avoid treatment is certainly wrong. However, when making pronouncements, one should pay attention to the actual situation at this time and in this place. The current state of our country is far from satisfactory; who does not know this? However, the blame for this should not be placed on any single individual or group. All those who are called Chinese bear some responsibility on their shoulders. Therefore, the most important thing today is that even if we cannot but condemn all realities, we must, in addition to condemnation, devise ways to handle the situation ourselves. The meaning is very clear: China belongs to the Chinese people.</p>
<p>Most intellectuals are also fond of seeking compromise and temporary peace. In the past, someone proposed making Beiping a cultural city, which is the strongest evidence of this idea. Moreover, people in the South believe that a crisis is lurking in North China, and they do not want to send their children to study in northern schools, which is a concrete manifestation of this mentality. How could they know that all these acts of passively accepting misfortune only serve to encourage those with ambitions to intensify their aggression? If the whole country were like this, iron hooves would gallop as if entering a land without people. Hu Shih once said, "Although the ceasefire in North China cannot make the enemy withdraw an inch from the four eastern provinces, at least it should prevent them from occupying an inch of land outside the four eastern provinces." Recently, Hu Shih said with emotion, "Now it seems, I was completely wrong." (See the *Ta Kung Pao* weekly essay on the 17th of this month.) Although Hu Shih blames the neglect of defense work, he may deeply regret his previous stance of concession and lack of psychological defense. Therefore, in the declaration he signed, there is the phrase "use the power of the whole country to maintain the territorial and administrative integrity of the country." This transformation is truly related to the future life of our nation. Having confidence in our strength and using it well is the key to survival.</p>

During the nighttime exercise, strict light control was implemented in various places.

<h3>After the Breakup of the Manchuria Conference, the Mongolian Delegate Returned to Kulun; Refusing to Accept Unreasonable Demands from the Puppet Government Was the Reason for the Breakdown of the Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Moscow) A report from Kulun states that the Manchuria-Mongolia Conference in Manchuria broke down again on November 25. The conference discussed the establishment of a Manchuria-Mongolia border committee and the exchange of representatives between the two sides. On the 25th, the "Manchurian" side refused to continue negotiations because the Mongolian side could not accept its final ultimatum-style request to send three representatives (one of whom was stationed in Kulun with the qualification of diplomatic representative). On the 26th, the Mongolian delegation, led by Sambu, rushed back to Kulun. According to well-informed sources in Mongolia, the reason for the breakdown of the negotiations was that the "Manchurian" side wanted to expand the scope of the negotiations beyond the original task. The Manchurian delegation did not discuss border issues, but rather demanded the establishment of Manchuria-Mongolia diplomatic relations in the form of an ultimatum. Although the "Manchurian" delegation later formally withdrew this request and agreed to limit the scope of negotiations to mediating border disputes, it still insisted on sending a "border" delegate to Kulun (Kulun is 1,000 kilometers from the border) in the form of an ultimatum. This actually maintains the original proposal, demanding recognition of the puppet state and the establishment of diplomatic relations. According to reports, the "Manchurian state" has not established diplomatic relations with other countries (including its neighbors), so the attitude of the "Manchurian government" is extremely surprising. At the same time, "Manchuria" has not issued any similar ultimatum to any country, nor has it made demands to intimidate with military action. Even if they were to exchange actual envoys, it would not contribute to peace and friendship. For example, China and Japan still maintain diplomatic relations to this day, but they have no normal and friendly relations. (28th TASS Telegram)</p>

<h3>Imagery Beauty (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Feng Zikai</p>
<p>My memory isn't so bad when it comes to the poetry and prose of the ancients. I can still recall quite a few examples. I've also excerpted some below for contemplation:</p>
<p>On the day the Taiping Scholar returns,</p>
<p>He and the Emperor shall untie robes of war.</p>
<p>One hundred forty thousand men all laid down their armor,</p>
<p>Not a single one was a man.</p>
<p>I strongly wish to follow you, but I'm too old,</p>
<p>I'll use illness as an excuse to resign from office.</p>
<p>Beneath Yanling Terrace, the Tongjiang River flows,</p>
<p>How many people untie their fishing lines to catch bass?</p>
<p>Year after year, war bones are buried in the wilderness,</p>
<p>Only to see grapes enter the Han court.</p>
<p>If Heaven's will is so, then let us enjoy the cup.</p>
<p>How can I obtain a ten-thousand-mile fur coat</p>
<p>To cover the four borders of the land?</p>
<p>Could the ruler bear to give up the conquest of Chen,</p>
<p>And only occupy a few acres of fields in Leithang?</p>
<p>Swallows before the halls of the old Wang and Xie families,</p>
<p>Fly into the homes of ordinary people.</p>
<p>Life in this world is not always satisfactory,</p>
<p>Tomorrow I will let my hair down and sail a small boat.</p>
<p>Who wept the most in the gathering?</p>
<p>The Jiangzhou Sima's green robe was wet with tears.</p>
<p>When shall we trim the western window candles together,</p>
<p>And talk about the night rain of Bashan?</p>
<p>Night rain trims spring chives,</p>
<p>New rice is cooked with yellow millet.</p>
<p>A guest comes from afar,</p>
<p>His clothes are covered in the rain of Baling.</p>
<p>The city cannot bear the arrival of the traveling monk,</p>
<p>Lest he startle the orioles before the painted tower.</p>
<p>I have three hundred Wu writing papers in my box,</p>
<p>I plan to use delicate strokes to express my spring sorrow.</p>
<p>If she could understand the love of extravagance,</p>
<p>She would freeze to death in the house of gold. (Ode to a Silkworm Woman)</p>
<p>From afar, I see the curtains of the main hall opening,</p>
<p>Palace women in robes and trousers sweep the imperial bed.</p>
<p>I bitterly hate pressing gold thread year after year,</p>
<p>Making wedding clothes for others.</p>
<p>Pingyang's singing and dancing newly receive favor,</p>
<p>Beyond the curtain, the spring cold bestows brocade robes.</p>
<p>If the east wind did not favor Zhou Lang,</p>
<p>The bronze sparrow terrace would lock up the two Qiaos in the depths of spring.</p>
<p>You come from my hometown,</p>
<p>You should know the affairs of my hometown.</p>
<p>The day you left, before the patterned window,</p>
<p>Did the winter plum blossoms bloom? I have a silk dress, Made when the Qin king was alive, I danced in the spring breeze a lot, But now in the autumn is no longer suitable. Hit the yellow oriole, Do not let it chirp on the branches. When it chirps, it disturbs my dreams, And I cannot reach Liaoxi.</p>
<p>The so-called "The Emperor and the General untie war robes" – is it really just untying war robes? It uses this concrete, trivial, and simple matter to suggest great rewards like promotions and riches. And does the Emperor really need to personally untie the war robes? Saying that he is willing to untie war robes implies great rewards, without the need to actually untie them. But to speak abstractly about great rewards is uninteresting; to speak concretely about untying war robes has poetic appeal. Similarly, "all lay down their armor" is the concrete way of saying they all surrendered, "resigning from office" is the concrete way of saying they resigned their positions, and "untying fishing lines to catch bass" is the concrete way of saying they were willing to live in seclusion. Poets best understand the secret of seeing the big picture in small things and the whole in individual cases; they are best at using a small, concrete matter to suggest a larger, abstract one. Saying "How can I obtain a ten-thousand-mile fur coat" reveals the desire to save the world. Saying "Swallows before the halls fly into the homes of ordinary people" reveals the decline of the halls and their people. Saying "green robe is wet" reveals the sorrow. Saying "sweep the imperial bed" and "bestows brocade robes" reveals the favor. Saying "locks up the two Qiaos" reveals the victory. At the same time, because these small events are all concrete, trivial, and simple, they can give the reader a definite, strong, vivid, and lively impression. After reading "trim the western window candles together" and "night rain trims spring chives," one can imagine the various sentiments of old friends reuniting after a long separation, drinking wine and talking under the lamp, as if one were there in person. Especially the last three five-character quatrains are entirely imagery beauty. The first only mentions "winter plum blossoms," the second only mentions a single "silk dress," and the third only mentions "hitting the yellow oriole." And the feelings of missing home, lamenting the passage of time, and longing for someone far away stand out clearly behind these small matters, deeply impressing themselves on the reader's mind.</p>
<p>From the perspective of the arts, music focuses on auditory beauty, i.e., the beauty of sound; painting focuses on visual beauty, i.e., the beauty of form; and literature focuses on the beauty of thought, i.e., the beauty of language. Then the so-called "imagery beauty" logically belongs in the realm of painting. Painting, apart from Cubism and Constructivism, often contains a large amount of the beauty of thought, i.e., the beauty of meaning, while literature, as mentioned above, also makes great use of imagery beauty. This can be seen as an exchange between literature and painting, a handshake between literature and painting. I once wrote a book "Literature and Painting" (Kaiming edition) discussing the various interactions between literature and painting. That was already two or three years ago. Now I have discovered another kind of interaction as described above, and I feel the interest of those days growing thick again.</p>

<h3>League of Nations Vigorously Seeks to Shorten the War by Expanding Sanctions; Oil Added to the List of Prohibited Items; US Support Facilitates Success; Eighteen-Nation Committee to Meet Next Month to Decide on Implementation Date</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is expected that the Eighteen-Nation Committee will convene on September 12 to consider the issue of an oil embargo. Hungary and Lithuania have also notified the League of Nations that they have resolved to implement full sanctions against Italy. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations officials believe that the Eighteen-Nation Committee will decide to implement the oil embargo soon. Although Italian headquarters troops have been moving recently, their purpose is to threaten any resolutions the League of Nations may adopt, and they are unlikely to have any impact. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Official sources here state that after the US government decided to limit the amount of oil it exports to warring countries, the League of Nations will find it easier to initiate an oil embargo against Italy, and the decision is expected sooner than anticipated. The British government previously hesitated to urge the League of Nations to proceed with this matter quickly, fearing that the US Congress might object later. Now that the US executive branch has taken action, the situation is different. The US will definitely support the League of Nations' efforts to maintain peace. The US Congress, when it reconvenes next January, will also support President Roosevelt's proposal to include oil in the list of prohibited goods. Furthermore, when the British Ambassador to France, Clark, met with French Premier Laval yesterday, the content of their discussion likely concerned both the oil embargo and the mutual assistance between Britain and France in the Mediterranean. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) Authorities here received news today that Italian troops will soon occupy the Lake Tana region. Lake Tana is the source of the Blue Nile, on which Egypt and Sudan rely for irrigation. Therefore, after the occupation, Britain will regard Italy as violating its promises, as well as violating the 1906 treaty dividing the economic spheres of influence in Abyssinia and the documents exchanged between Britain and Italy in 1925. It is also understood that a full cabinet meeting has decided to find ways to enable member states of the League of Nations to implement an oil embargo against Italy as soon as possible. Foreign Secretary Hoare has also asked US representative Atherton to assure that the sanctions committee will likely convene in early December to discuss the immediate oil embargo against Italy. (National News, 27th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US government has refused permission for the oil tanker Ulysses to sail to Italy carrying oil, and a dispute has apparently arisen between the US and Italy. However, diplomatic circles remain tight-lipped today. Well-informed observers believe today that Italian Ambassador Rosso has protested to Secretary of State Hull about this matter. However, both the State Department and the Italian Embassy are unwilling to confirm this news. One official said that this matter is too complicated to discuss. Diplomats here believe that this already implicitly acknowledges that a dispute has arisen between the two parties. The US Director of Transportation, Peacock, stated that "the status of the Ulysses remains unchanged," which shows that the US attitude is quite firm. (National News, 27th)</p>
<h3>Hungarian Premier Visits Vienna to Discuss Economic Issues Between the Two Countries</h3>
<p>Budapest: Prime Minister Gömbös and Foreign Minister Kánya are scheduled to visit Vienna tomorrow to confer with Austrian Chancellor Schuschnigg. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös and Foreign Minister Kánya will arrive here tomorrow to visit Prime Minister Schuschnigg. Although official sources here state that the visit of Hungarian dignitaries is of a social nature, as cabinet members of Austria and Hungary routinely exchange visits and exchange views after a certain period, semi-official sources believe that the prime ministers of Austria and Hungary will discuss the economic situation of the two countries and plan to discuss the common attitude that the two countries will adopt towards the sanctions issue. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Company Leases Cotton Fields in Dutch New Guinea; Dutch Officials Say There Is No Need to Overreact</h3>
<p>The Hague: Government officials stated today that while there is concern that Japan will gain a foothold in the East Indies because Dutch merchants have allowed a certain Japanese company to lease cotton fields in Dutch New Guinea, there is actually no need to overreact. This is because the leased land is only 300 hectares, and the number of Japanese people who can work there is at most 400. (National News, 27th)</p>
<h3>Over Forty Countries Have Implemented Sanctions Against Italy; Egypt and Persia Respond to Italian Protests</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Experts met here today and stated that the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy are not being relaxed. The Chairman of the Sanctions Coordination Committee, Portuguese representative Vasconcelos, announced that 47 countries have banned the shipment of arms and ammunition to Italy, 43 countries have implemented financial sanctions, 37 countries have boycotted Italian goods, and 38 countries have banned the shipment of major items to Italy. In addition, many countries are either preparing to implement sanctions or have already accepted the plan in principle. It was learned today that representatives from various countries are currently considering expanding the scope of sanctions as soon as possible to include items such as oil, coal, iron, and steel. (National News, 27th)</p>
<p>Cairo, Egypt: The Council of Ministers has recently issued an order prohibiting the import of all Italian goods into Egyptian territory and prohibiting the transport of manganese ore and livestock to Italy. However, cotton is still permitted to be transported to Italy. In addition, the Council of Ministers has also decided to respond to Italy's protest against sanctions and will send the reply to the Italian government immediately. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Tehran, Iran: The Iranian government has submitted a reply to the Italian protest against sanctions and delivered it to the Italian envoy to Iran today. The reply stated that the Iranian government regrets that it has had to adopt the resolutions of the League of Nations. However, the good relations between Iran and Italy still exist, and it is hoped that the current efforts of various countries will be sufficient to promote the restoration of world peace and justice.

<h3>Italian Troops Retreat Simultaneously on the Northern and Southern Fronts; Deeply Concerned That Rear Communications Will Be Severed; Arrawe to Attack Italian Somaliland; New Italian Commander-in-Chief Arrives in Eritrea</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: Today, the Abyssinian authorities announced that Italian troops have abandoned Magal. After the news was released, tens of thousands of people filled the streets, cheering and celebrating. Many said that the Italians have now realized they have bitten off more than they can chew. According to government sources, the Italian troops stationed in Magal suddenly and hurriedly retreated yesterday, carrying tanks, artillery, military supplies, and heavy vehicles, gathering at the station and heading back to Adigrat, near the Eritrean border (50 miles from Magal). According to a captured native officer, the Italian troops had to retreat urgently because they had advanced too quickly, failing to clear the surrounding area, including Lantanbian, and ensure the stability of their communication lines before attacking. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: It was officially announced here today that 1,000 Italian white troops have retreated from Magal to Adigrat, abandoning the front line for 53 kilometers. However, Askari troops are still stationed there. Abyssinians were extremely excited after hearing this news and believe that the Italian troops retreated because "clearing the countryside" was unsuccessful, so they had no choice but to retreat to consolidate their front closer to Italian Eritrea. An official in the Abyssinian palace, referring to the news announced yesterday of the Italian withdrawal from Gorahei and Galogobi, said that the Emperor's claim that the Abyssinian army could defeat the Italian army was indeed well-founded, and that Rome's claim that the Ogaden province had surrendered to Italy had been proven inaccurate. According to Abyssinian sources, if the facts are true, then Italy has returned to the position of November 23 last year, i.e., the boundary line set by the demarcation commission in Walwal. (National News, 27th)</p>
<p>Harar: The troops under the command of General Tafari on the southern front have invaded Italian Somaliland and are now seriously threatening the Italian communication lines. According to news today, the vanguard of the Abyssinian army, the troops of the Fano tribe, are approaching the important Italian town of Ischia Baidoa in Somaliland, which is only 150 miles from the capital of Somaliland, Mogadishu. It is reported that the main force of the Abyssinian army is not far northwest of the vanguard. According to reliable sources, this extraordinary general (Tafari) rode a white horse and led a crowd of about 100,000 from the Sidamo tribe straight down the Juba River valley, then crossed the border and entered Italian Somaliland. Although many died in battle or from fever along the way, this army advanced like a giant snake, finally reaching enemy territory and shaking Mogadishu. As a result, Italian General Graziani had to divide his troops from the Gota highlands to resist them. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<p>Asmara: The newly appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Italian East African Forces, General Badoglio, arrived in Massawa this morning and will soon arrive here. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Authorities here today denied the Abyssinian claim of a great victory and the Italian abandonment of Magal, calling it a joke and saying that there is no need to deny such obviously fabricated news. Furthermore, the Italian troops in Abyssinia are still firmly holding the positions they have captured. (Reuters, 27th)</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Italian Retreat</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: Our special correspondent O’Chana reports that official circles here are skeptical of the claim that Italian troops are attacking the Lake Tana area. However, the simultaneous retreat of Italian troops on the Ogaden area of the southern front and the Tigray province of the northern front has attracted significant attention here. Military personnel investigating the true motives for the Italian retreat mostly say that it is because the Abyssinian army on the Tigray province front is intercepting Italian troops erratically, and the Italian army is deeply concerned that communication between the rear and the front will be severed by the Abyssinian army, so they had no choice but to retreat. As for the Italian troops on the Ogaden front, they feared that General Dejazmach Destas's troops would outflank their rear or intercept the left flank of the Italian army, so they also had no choice but to retreat. As for general speculation, it is believed that after the new commander of the Italian front, General Badoglio, arrives at the front, the strategy will definitely change. Currently, the Abyssinian army is concentrating its forces on the line from Jijiga to Dagahbur. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian King Removes a Political Enemy</h3>
<p>(Rome) The deposed Abyssinian Emperor Lij Iyasu recently died in custody. It is rumored that he was poisoned by drinking poisonous milk, causing chronic poisoning. According to a war correspondent accompanying troops on the Tigray province front, when Lij Iyasu was detained in the Abyssinian capital, his former subordinates planned to escape from prison. Later, when the Italo-Abyssinian war broke out, Lij Iyasu was moved to three or four different detention locations for fear of accidents. Now that Lij Iyasu is dead, the Abyssinian King has lost a political enemy, and his position has naturally been strengthened. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Naval Conference Next Month; Britain to Submit Proposals; Emphasis on Both Qualitative and Quantitative Restrictions</h3>
<p>(London) It was learned here today that after the Naval Conference opens on December 6, Britain intends to submit a strong request to abolish submarine restrictions on battleship size and cannon caliber. British representatives will also propose that major naval powers exchange warship construction plans for the next six years and determine the maximum tonnage of warships of all classes. Britain advocates using this as the basis for a new naval treaty. (National News, 27th)</p>
<h3>Britain and the United States Secretly Cooperating</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Noteworthy news has emerged from Japan that Britain and the United States have recently been engaged in secret negotiations and have agreed to cooperate with each other. That is, at the upcoming formal disarmament conference, Britain will disregard Japan's proposed equal ratio and fully support the US position in order to suppress Japan's new demands. They have also agreed not to propose any further reductions in battleships. On the Geneva front, the US government is secretly supporting Britain's policy toward Italy, so that Britain can fulfill its original intention of using the League of Nations to sanction Italy. Therefore, the US government is disregarding the formal naval conference, while on the other hand, it will try to put forward a new proposal to maintain peace in Europe in order to curry favor with Britain, hoping that Britain can help the US restrain Japan's attitude on the naval conference and East Asian issues. This secret cooperation plan has attracted great attention from the Japanese government. (China United Press, 28th)</p>
<h3>Britain Asks League of Nations to Send Observers</h3>
<p>(London) The British government intends to ask the League of Nations to send observers to attend the Naval Conference. It has sent telegrams to the governments of Japan and the United States to seek their consent. Although the replies from those countries have not yet arrived, official sources believe that they will definitely agree. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Japanese General Nagano to Stay Briefly in Berlin</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The Japanese Chief Delegate to the London Naval Conference, General Nagano, and his entourage of 15 people will arrive here from Moscow on Saturday. They are scheduled to stay here for one day. (Note: The conference of Japanese military attachés in Europe is scheduled to be held in Berlin on that day). (Havas, 28th)</p>
<h3>Pacific Situation; Determining Future Policy</h3>
<p>(Washington) The East African War has made the US government pay more attention to the Pacific. Americans are well aware that the major commercial and policy issues of the future lie in the Pacific. The US fleet's presence on the Pacific coast indicates that if the international balance of power is shaken, the US will devote all its efforts to the Pacific rather than the Atlantic. The government has repeatedly hoped to implement its good neighbor policy in the Pacific. The National Anti-War Association also supports this proposal. The association has made every effort to improve relations in the Pacific. (National News, 27th)</p>
<h3>Italy to Expand Navy; Needs 400 Million Lire</h3>

<h3>League of Nations Technical Expert Mr. Gheerbrant to Come to China</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Communications and Transit Section of the League of Nations, at the request of the Chinese government last year, sent four technicians to China to investigate various issues concerning water conservancy projects and road transportation, and to serve as liaison between the League of Nations and China for technical cooperation. One of the four technicians is Mr. Gheerbrant, Director of Public Works of Madagascar, French Africa. Mr. Gheerbrant is scheduled to depart for China soon. Today, he was received and held talks by Colonial Minister Roland. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Military Attachés in Europe to Convene Meeting in Berlin</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The conference of Japanese military attachés in Europe is scheduled to be held in Berlin on November 30 and will last for four days. The military attachés from the Japanese embassies in the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Latvia arrived here today. The military attachés from the Japanese embassies in Britain, France, and Italy will arrive here tomorrow. It should be noted that the last conference of Japanese military attachés in Europe was held in Berlin two years ago. Major Oshima, the military attaché at the Japanese embassy in Germany, and other Japanese military attachés in Germany, totaling 22 people, will all participate in this conference. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3>Laval Cabinet Successfully Navigates First Major Hurdle; Financial Plan Passes Vote of Confidence in the Chamber of Deputies; Radical Socialist Party Strongly Supports the Government; Tight Security Around Paris to Prevent Riots</h3>
<p>(Paris) After deliberation, the Chamber of Deputies has passed a vote of confidence in the government's current financial plan. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies reconvened at 3:10 PM and the leaders of each party immediately accepted Premier Laval's proposal to discuss the activities of fascist groups next Tuesday. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Security forces within 100 miles of Paris entered the capital this morning to guard against disturbances during the reconvening of Parliament or the collapse of the cabinet. (National News, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The hopes for the government to overcome its difficulties have improved today as the Radical Party has endorsed the government's request to debate the franc issue first when the Chamber of Deputies meets. The first vote on a vote of confidence in the government is sure to be a victory for the government. The Left parties met today and have not yet agreed on a common strategy to resist the government. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Chamber of Deputies is scheduled to reconvene at 3 PM today. Premier Laval is scheduled to deliver a speech at 4 PM. As usual, before each major debate in the Chamber of Deputies, each political party must meet in advance to decide on its stance. The major parties have held separate meetings yesterday and this morning, and their decisions made at the last minute have stabilized the Laval cabinet's position. Among them, the parties of the Right and Center have decided to support the cabinet. The Radical Party, which occupies the most important position among the parties in the Chamber of Deputies, also held a meeting this morning, as did the Independent Socialist Party. Although that party decided to endorse the Orthodox Socialist Party's demand that the Chamber of Deputies immediately discuss the issue of protecting the Republican system (i.e., the issue of suppressing fascist groups) before discussing financial issues, the Radical Party passed a resolution by a vote of 39 to 28 (the remaining party members did not vote), endorsing the government's proposal to discuss financial issues first. The party leader, Minister of State Herriot, also asked all members of parliament to vote unanimously in favor. The voices of the left wing of the party, however, were not taken into account. In addition, the Left parties in the Chamber of Deputies are scheduled to hold a joint meeting at 1:30 PM to decide on a common attitude. However, the opinions of the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Independent Socialist Party, and the Radical Party, which are opposed to the government, are divergent and may not be able to compromise with each other. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) At the Radical Party's parliamentary caucus this morning, the party leader, Minister of State Herriot, delivered a speech in support of the Laval cabinet, saying, "If the current cabinet collapses, there are three possible solutions: first, to organize a 'People's Front government,' which would require dissolving the Chamber of Deputies; second, for the Radical Party to form a cabinet alone, but in the current situation, no one in our party dares to take sole responsibility; third, to organize a new cabinet similar to the current cabinet, so why bother?" (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Left parties' plan to overthrow the Laval government has already been split, so Laval may be able to win a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies when Parliament opens tomorrow. The Left parties already showed signs of division when they met yesterday. Today, the Socialist Party, the Radical Party, and the Communist Party have failed to agree on financial policy, and so the rift has been confirmed. (National News, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) Circles here say that France's failure to acknowledge the necessity of lowering the price of the franc is only delaying the inevitable. The franc is falling step by step, and today the British Exchange Equalisation Account had to step in to assist it. Recent news from Paris says that some of the capital that has flowed out recently has been returned to Paris because Laval has a good chance of winning a vote of confidence in the Chamber of Deputies today. However, it will be difficult for the French government to raise 60 billion francs in domestic debt in the current market, as the French financial community is well aware that there are no sufficient repayment measures in the budget for this bond. Furthermore, the purchasing power of the franc is too high abroad and too low domestically, which is inconsistent. This is well known to people in London and Paris, and it is expected that the French people will understand that losing the franc is better than losing gold reserves, and France may not be willing to allow the currency to depreciate.

<h3>French Gold Flows to the US</h3>

<h3>Grand Gathering in London - Tens of Thousands Throng the Streets - Eager to See the Preview of Our Country's Antiquities - Important Figures from Britain and Other Countries Attend Together - Viewers Praised the Rare Treasures - Will Have a Great Impact on British Art</h3>
<p>(London) The preview of the International Exhibition of Chinese Art was held today. Many important figures from Britain and other countries attended, and there were many guests. Hundreds of cars were parked on the roadside, causing extreme traffic congestion. Home Secretary Simon and his wife waited outside the venue before the doors opened and only entered with the crowd more than half an hour later. Almost the entire London diplomatic community spent most of the day at the venue. Lord President of the Council MacDonald arrived early with his daughter and only left in the afternoon. Prime Minister Baldwin and his wife also spent several hours at the venue. British nobles and important figures from London society came together, but there were too many visitors to appreciate the exhibits carefully. Foreign Secretary Hoare and others arrived a little late and did not have time to see everything, so they all said they would come again another day. Government officials, such as the Overseas Trade Secretary and the Under-Secretary of State for India, as well as the Bishop of London and the Poet Laureate, were among the visitors.</p>
<p>The jade exhibition room aroused great interest, and the tiny characters engraved on the gemstone flakes, which could only be read with a magnifying glass, were especially appreciated. One room with a carved lacquer ceiling, a Ming Dynasty carved lacquer table inlaid with gold and silver threads, and a screen and large vase placed daily, was crowded with visitors. A box sent by Soviet Russia for display, containing various Chinese gold ornaments such as rings, hairpins, and bracelets, was especially noticed by women. Many viewers seemed to find the Chinese paintings hanging in the venue incomprehensible, but members of the Royal Academy of Arts of Britain studied them intently. One member said privately, "This is what I have been seeking day and night. I feel I have wasted my life." Many scholars are trying to conduct long-term research work at the venue. One scholar has been studying ancient bronzes from before the Common Era for three weeks and has not yet visited other exhibition rooms.</p>
<p>Today, visitors all praised the exquisite beauty of the antiquities and the thoughtful arrangement. The general opinion is that at a time when the artistic conception of Britain needs new supplements, this exhibition will have a great impact on the artistic conception of Britain. The Royal Central Asian Society of Britain will hold a reception on December 2nd, at which Guo Taiqi and the famous British scholar Pinyang will give speeches. The British government also plans to hold a banquet on December 3rd, chaired by the Minister of Works Gore, and members of the cabinet, diplomats stationed in Britain, and important Chinese figures will all attend. (Reuters telegram, 27th)</p>
<p>(London) The London Exhibition of Chinese Art will continue to be open to the public until it closes in March next year. This Exhibition of Chinese Art is hosted by the Royal Academy of Arts of Britain and is of grand scale, unprecedented in previous exhibitions. Even the Exhibition of Chinese Art held in Berlin in 1929 is far inferior. The exhibits this time were collected with unprecedented effort from all sides, displaying Chinese art from the past 3,500 years for viewing. Since the beginning of 1924, experts from Chinese art and hygiene groups here have organized study groups to go to the Far East to select and collect art treasures and negotiate with local people to transport China's priceless treasures to Britain for exhibition. Fortunately, with the support of the British government and the cooperation of the Chinese authorities, it was possible to collect all of China's most precious works of art, the essence of which is especially the treasures collected in the Forbidden City in Beijing. It is known that only a few famous officials and dignitaries have been able to feast their eyes on the treasures of the Forbidden City until recently, so their preciousness is evident.</p>
<p>Because the collection of Chinese art this time is so vast, the cruiser Suffolk was specially dispatched to transport it to Britain. In addition to the treasures of the Forbidden City, the exhibits on display at the exhibition also include the collections of famous collectors in Europe and the United States, which are displayed together, especially the collections of Buckingham Palace and private treasures, which add to the splendor.</p>
<p>After these treasures were transported to Britain, those in charge of the exhibition affairs were also very careful in the procedures such as unpacking and arranging them to avoid damage. Many experts in Chinese antiquities came to Britain to participate in the preparatory work. Only Chinese experts were allowed to enter the antique arrangement and window display. These windows were all locked in a special way. The preparatory members had carefully arranged each exhibition room, compiled an extremely noteworthy catalog, and invited various experts familiar with Chinese art to hold lectures to facilitate British and foreign audiences. The exhibits on display at the venue included carvings, paintings, porcelain, jade, bronzes, etc., a dazzling array of beautiful things, and all kinds of antiquities were full of vitality, which were all obtained from direct observation of life.

<h3>Greek King Orders Themistocles - To Organize a Supra-Party Cabinet - Conflict Over Amnesty Issue with Former Regent</h3>

Former Prime Minister Venizelos, who is currently exiled in Paris, is also on the amnesty list. However, the cabinet was unwilling to pardon Venizelos and refused to sign the amnesty order, so the King ordered Themistocles to organize a temporary supra-party cabinet.

<h3>Christmas is Near - US Commerce Develops - Coastal Guards Deployed to Prevent Liquor Imports</h3>
<p>(Washington) Coastal guards deployed to prevent liquor imports. Commerce Secretary Robb, based on reports from across the country, said today that US Christmas commerce will increase by 10% to 25% compared to last year, reaching its highest peak since 1930, providing jobs for thousands of unemployed people. A report from the Federal Reserve Bank stated that national industrial production in October increased compared to before, and the total number of workers and wages was also higher. Bank deposits also increased, and foreign gold continued to flow in. (National Telegram, 28th)</p>
<p>Boston: A large number of cargo ships loaded with liquor to meet Christmas purchases have appeared offshore. It is widely believed that this is the largest smuggling operation since the repeal of Prohibition. Therefore, today, the entire coastal guard of New London, New Hampshire, was deployed. Although today is a national holiday, guards were not allowed to take leave and go ashore and patrolled the sea all day long. Sky patrols have also been doubled. According to Maynard, a tax collector from this port, the matter is related to the large-scale smuggling operation Trus in New York. The team has a total of six to eight cargo ships, anchored 75 miles offshore, surrounded by dozens of speedboats, so that smuggled goods can be transported ashore at any time.

<h3>Zhangzhou Prefecture Rice Tax - Decision to Start Collecting Next Month - Representatives from Various Places Petition to Exempt Tax, Rice Merchants Unanimously Suspend Distribution of Rice for Export</h3>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: People from various parts of Southern Fujian previously petitioned the provincial government to exempt the collection of the Zhangzhou Prefecture rice tax, but the provincial government has not yet approved it. At 2 PM on the 25th of this month, more than a dozen representatives from the Longxi Shima Haicheng Chamber of Commerce and farmers jointly went to Zhangzhou to meet with the Director of the Tax Bureau to request a postponement of the rice tax. The Director of the Tax Bureau stated that he dared not disobey the orders of his superiors and agreed to start collecting the tax on the first day of next month. Thereupon, the representatives returned in disappointment. At the same time, the Rice Tax Office issued a notice on the implementation of the rice tax, stating: "According to the order of the Fujian Provincial Government Finance Office No. 1999, with the confidential order No. 4743 of the Provincial Government Secretariat, the 61st meeting of the Provincial Government Committee on October 30 this year resolved to prepare rice donations to offset security expenses in order to abolish the collection of various county group fee surcharges. In addition to ordering the Administrative Inspector of the Fifth District and the county magistrates of Zhangzhou Prefecture to assist earnestly and issue a notice, copy the original resolution and order immediate compliance, report the collection date, etc. This Director should comply and implement, in addition to setting up offices for inspection and verification in Shima, Shimei, Port, and Fuhe, etc., starting from the 25th of this month, according to the donation rate in the original proposal, Zhangzhou's export rice is 230 pounds, converted to the new standard weight of 211 catties, and five dimes of ocean is collected, which all should comply."</p>
<p>It is found that the Shima Tax Office is attached to the Che Lu Tou Tax Inspection Office, and the original plan was to start collecting on the 25th. As a result of the petitions to the Tax Bureau by representatives from various places, only a postponement to the first day of next month was granted. The Shima Rice Industry Association immediately convened a meeting on the 25th, attended by more than 30 rice merchants. After discussion, it was decided that from the 26th, all rice merchants would unanimously suspend the distribution of rice for export and stop purchasing from rural areas for ten days to wait for a resolution. After ten days, another meeting will be convened, and rice merchants in Zhangzhou Haicheng have also expressed their views. (November 27th)</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province Issues Short-Term Treasury Bills for the Third Time - Total Issuance of 10 Million Yuan, Provincial Bank Increases Issuance of Vouchers</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Guangdong Province is imitating the central government in implementing the new currency policy, but without adequate preparation beforehand, the small banknotes and legal tender issued by the provincial and municipal banks are insufficient. Even the silver dollar notes printed previously have been used as small banknotes and legal tender, and those bringing silver to the bank to exchange for banknotes are still overcrowded. In recent days, the provincial bank has restricted those exchanging for banknotes, but it is still difficult to cope with the demand. Therefore, special vouchers have been issued. Local bank drafts are issued at branch offices and business offices in various prefectures, and legal tender vouchers are issued at the Guangzhou head office, divided into 50 yuan, 200 yuan, 300 yuan, 500 yuan, and 1,000 yuan denominations. It is also stipulated that for those exchanging large amounts of silver for legal tender, vouchers will be issued together at the time of payment. In addition to allowing taxpayers to use 50 yuan silver dollar legal tender vouchers or various legal tender notes for all taxes under 100 yuan, all taxes above 100 yuan should be paid with vouchers issued by the provincial and municipal banks to facilitate circulation. Recently, the Department of Finance issued treasury bills for the third time, with a total issuance of 10 million yuan, which will be issued starting on the first day of next month. The regulations for these treasury bills are as follows: Article 1: The Guangdong Provincial Government, in order to regulate finance, issues short-term treasury bills, named the "Guangdong Province Third Short-Term Financial Treasury Bills of the Republic of China, Year 24." Article 2: The total amount of these treasury bills is set at 10 million yuan in Guangdong Province's legal tender. Article 3: These treasury bills are guaranteed by the provincial treasury's income from the special tax on miscellaneous items of imported agricultural products and the business deed tax from the entire province. Counting from the date of issuance, the issuance period is 20 days. After the issuance period expires, the lottery will begin in two months, and the principal and interest will be repaid evenly over three months. Article 4: The interest rate on these treasury bills is 1% per month, calculated monthly based on the order of the lottery. That is, 1 yuan of interest is paid per 100 yuan for the first month's lottery, 2 yuan of interest is paid per 100 yuan for the second month's lottery, and so on. Article 5: From the third month after the expiration of the issuance period of these treasury bills to the date of the lottery in the fifth month, the Department of Finance will allocate the amount of principal and interest due for that month from the income from the special tax on imported agricultural products and the business deed tax and hand it over to the Guangdong Provincial Bank for safekeeping to be used for the repayment of principal and interest after the lottery. Article 6: The issuance, promotion, repayment of principal, and payment of interest of these treasury bills shall be entrusted to the Guangdong Provincial Bank by the Department of Finance. Commercial banks and silver shops in Guangzhou City, as well as miscellaneous shops, may collect vouchers for distribution in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of these regulations. Article 7: These treasury bills are divided into 100 yuan, 50 yuan, and 10 yuan denominations. Article 8: These treasury bills are designated as bearer bonds. Article 9: These treasury bills are scheduled to be issued on December 1, 1935. Article 10: The Guangdong Provincial Bank will issue these treasury bills at 94% of the face value. Distributing firms will receive 100 yuan of vouchers for every 94 yuan of legal tender per 100 yuan of face value. Of the six yuan deducted, two yuan is stipulated as the distributing fee for distributing firms, and the remaining four yuan belongs to the voucher purchaser, that is, it is stipulated that voucher purchasers purchase vouchers from distributing firms at 96% of the face value. Article 10: Voucher purchasers or distributing firms may freely mortgage, buy, and sell these treasury bills from the date of issuance to the date of the last month's lottery and may also use them as security deposits or guarantees for other public affairs. Article 12: Those who forge these treasury bills or damage credit and other acts will be punished according to law. Article 13: These regulations shall be implemented from the date of promulgation (November 23rd)</p>

<h3>Fujian Province Tobacco Label Proceeding - Tobacco Prohibition Associations Established in Various Counties One After Another - Annual Sales of Local Opium in the Province Approximately 6 Million Yuan</h3>
<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The Fujian Provincial Tobacco Prohibition Committee was organized and established in September. The counties that have reported the establishment of branch associations include Minhou, Changle, Ningde, Nanping, Gutian, Yong'an, Shunchang, Pucheng, Jianyang, Songxi, Zhenghe, Shaowu, Hui'an, Anxi, Zhangpu, Dehua, Haicheng, Longyan, Zhangping, Shanghang, Jianning, Tong'an, Jinjiang, Zhao'an, Luoyuan, Fuding, Minqing, Putian, Nan'an, Changtai, Ningyang, and other counties. The remaining counties are being urged to organize by the Provincial Tobacco Prohibition Committee in conjunction with the Department of Civil Affairs, with a deadline of the end of the year for uniform establishment. The association plans to eradicate opium throughout the province within three years. The first step is to register opium addicts, and the second step is to establish opium addiction treatment centers, each with a term of six months. The first term is for voluntary registration and voluntary opium cessation, and the second term is for compulsory registration and compulsory opium cessation. For each county branch association that has been established, the provincial capital sends one investigator to handle the registration of seedling varieties and opium addicts. These investigators are publicly selected and recruited, trained for three weeks, and taught various opium prohibition regulations before being sent to serve in various counties. The first batch of more than 20 people has completed training and has been dispatched recently. The second batch has also begun training. Recently, the Provincial Tobacco Prohibition Committee also resolved that the local opium paste companies in various counties should be managed by the county government to prevent the theft and sale of private opium. Opium paste shops are not allowed to sell opium paste to unregistered opium addicts. Although opium addicts have been registered, they should also smoke at home and not gather to smoke in opium dens. In addition, each county is ordered to report the situation of opium addict registration on a monthly basis for verification. For those that have been completed, each county district should obtain a certificate of guarantee and submit it for review. If there are any inaccuracies, the county magistrate and district chief should be severely punished. As for the situation of opium paste sales in various counties of the province, according to the latest report from the Opium Prohibition Supervisory Office, a large county such as Jinjiang can sell 12,000 taels per month, and a small county such as Zhangpu can sell 2,000 taels per month. The price of each tael of opium is approximately 3 yuan. Jinjiang should sell more than 400,000 yuan annually, and Zhangpu should sell more than 70,000 yuan annually. If the average annual sales of opium in each county, large or small, is standardized at 100,000 yuan, then the more than 60 counties in the province should sell more than 6 million yuan of opium paste, which can be said to be huge. However, Zhao Dajun, Director of the Opium Prohibition Office, still believes that the party, government, and military organs in various places have failed to understand the tasks of the opium paste companies and shops, resulting in many obstacles to the process and making it difficult to handle. The tax revenue has not improved. He went to Hankou this month to report the situation to the head office and requested resignation. After being retained by the head office, in addition to urging him to actively proceed with methods to promote sales, he also sent a letter to the provincial government ordering its subordinates to assist in handling the matter. Another person, Feng Wenyu, was appointed as Deputy Director to assist in planning. Zhao and Feng both arrived in the province yesterday. There may be some changes to the province's future methods for promoting opium sales. (November 27th)</p>
<h3>Beiping: Financial Situation Increasingly Chaotic - Merchants Worry and Unwilling to Accept Central Government Dime Notes - Difficult to Exchange Copper Yuan Tickets for Bus Rides and Purchases - Tianjin Issued New Copper Yuan Tickets with a Reserve of 200,000 Yuan</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: Due to Tongzhou's declaration of autonomy, the market in Beiping feels more depressed, and the financial sector is even more unstable. In addition, due to the disturbances of the Tianjin Autonomy Daredevil Team, copper coins are increasingly being hoarded, resulting in the suffering of not being able to exchange paper money for copper coins. Many small private banks and cigarette shops are hoarding copper coins and are unwilling to exchange them. The authorities have not been able to negotiate concrete and effective measures to crack down on this. Stores in Dong'an Market, Xidan Market, and Quanye Market, as well as ordinary vendors, are unwilling to accept dime notes and copper yuan tickets, and even dime notes are not welcome. Trams are also unwilling to accept paper tickets. Citizens are suffering from not being able to exchange them and can only cry in despair. The chaos in the financial sector has reached this point. Although the Beiping municipal authorities intend to thoroughly resolve this, they intend to change the standard price of copper coins to 500 to 470 coins per yuan, that is, 5,000 to 4,700 wen, as in Shanghai, so that there is room for flexibility, but a decision has not yet been made to implement this.</p>
<p>In fact, there is no shortage of copper coins in Beiping. Because the market price is lower, most hoarding merchants are unwilling to sell them. The hoarding of steel coins is quite complex. Tram companies and tea, oil, and salt shops are hoarding the copper coins they receive in small amounts. Farmers, servants, and footmen also try to collect and save small amounts of copper coins when they see that steel coins are scarce. Although the amount saved by each person is limited, the number of savers is large, so the quantity is naturally not small. Because the supply of steel coins cannot meet the demand, prices have risen sharply, but the casting of new copper coins is not allowed by the authorities, so the only option is to issue new copper yuan tickets to facilitate market circulation, and the price of copper coins will naturally fall, and the accumulated copper coins will flow out.</p>
<p>In order to rescue the copper yuan, the Beiping financial community organized the Hebei Province Copper Yuan Ticket Issuance Reserve. The internal organization consists of six directors, appointed by Zou Quansun, Ji Hua, Zhou Zuomin, Zhong E, Yao Zesheng, Wang Xiaoyan, and others. The Hebei Provincial Government and the Pingjin Municipal Governments will each appoint one supervisor. The reserve fund is tentatively set at 200,000 yuan, which will be raised by groups such as the Pingjin Chambers of Commerce, banks, and silver coin guilds. The expenses will be met from the interest generated by the reserve fund. If it is not enough, the Hebei Provincial Government and the Pingjin Municipal Governments will be asked to subsidize it. The scope of work is to rescue finance and circulate the market, and it does not engage in profit-making businesses. In order to meet urgent needs, the old copper yuan tickets stored but not yet issued by the Hebei Provincial Bank in Tianjin will be used temporarily, totaling approximately 300,000 yuan. After new tickets are printed, they will be gradually withdrawn. During the period of substitute use, the ticket face will be stamped with a small seal of the "Hebei Provincial Bank Copper Yuan Ticket Issuance Reserve." This has been approved by the last meeting and entrusted to Zhou Zuomin to be fully responsible. It is expected that it will be realized in the shortest possible time. (26th)</p>
<h3>Japanese Steel Materials - Sharp Increase in Imports to China - Trying to Compete with European and American Markets</h3>
<p>Dalian Correspondence: The import of Japanese steel materials to China has greatly increased this year. Showa Steel Works in the Northeast market has been increasing production, and Anshan Steel Materials has also begun to extend pressure. In the future, the Japanese mainland side will have a more aggressive situation for opening up the Chinese market due to geographical conditions. Because Japanese steel materials will engage in fierce competition with the goods of European and American enterprises in the Chinese market and gain a foothold. Therefore, Mitsui Bussan, the number one overseas advancement company in Japan, has already made great sacrifices, inviting the Shanghai Steel Merchants Group, and this time also inviting the Chinese Tianjin Hardware Association Group, to understand the current situation of the Japanese iron and steel industry, so the recent liaison and advancement to China is very active. Mitsubishi, Iwai, and other foreign firms have further strengthened the internal structures of their Shanghai and Tianjin branches, all in an attempt to seize the Chinese market from European and American merchants in order to monopolize the dumping position.

<h3>A Brief History of the Development of Modern Science (A Lecture to National Middle School Students on November 16th and 18th)</h3>
<p>— (Continued)</p>
<p>(II) Reasons for the Rapid Advance of Modern Science</p>
<p>Modern science history begins with Columbus's discovery of America, as mentioned earlier. Not long after the discovery of the New World, the Portuguese Magellan and others circumnavigated the globe, proving the theory of a spherical Earth, which greatly invigorated the thinking of Europeans. Besides this, there are five other reasons for the rapid advance of modern science, which are detailed below.</p>
<p>I. The Renaissance - The period from the 14th to the 16th centuries was the European Renaissance, its greatest achievement being "the awakening of mankind." This means: "I have ears and eyes and cannot abandon intelligence; I have a brain and cannot abandon thought; I have a conscience and cannot abandon judgment." Not only is the development of scientific research a manifestation of this spirit, but also the outbreak of the religious revolution and the emergence of vernacular literature were influenced by this spirit.</p>
<p>II. The Establishment of the Scientific Method - According to archaeological estimates, our planet has existed for about 250 million years, and human history for about one million years. Why has science not progressed as rapidly in this long period of one million years as it has in the last one or two hundred years? This is because the scientific method was only fully established at the beginning of the 17th century. The Englishman Bacon and the Frenchman Descartes opposed the prevailing deductive method and advocated the inductive method. Bacon's book "New Organon" elaborates on the meaning of the inductive method. He said that we should first observe natural things in order to find principles; we should not rely solely on subjective reason and force all facts to fit. Bacon's inductive method has three steps: (1) collect all facts without omission; (2) analyze and compare all facts; (3) discover the causes of each phenomenon. I will give another example to illustrate the application of this method: someone sees bubbles in a pond getting larger as they rise from the bottom and asks why the volume of the gas increases. To solve this problem, the first step is to collect all the facts about changes in gas volume; the second step is to analyze and compare, thereby discovering that both pressure and temperature can change the volume of a gas; the third step is to assume that the distance between gas molecules can change, and then use experimental methods to prove whether this assumption is correct. Thus, the conclusion is reached: the distance between gas molecules can be changed by external pressure; the pressure of the water in the pond is greater at the bottom and smaller at the top, so the bubbles gradually increase in volume as they rise from the bottom. This conclusion is based on many observations and experiments, and has undergone rigorous criticism and comparison, so it is more reliable. Descartes' method went further; he advocated first dividing a problem into the simplest factors, and then using Bacon's method to conduct scientific research on each factor. The methods of Bacon and Descartes were indeed important tools for the development of science.</p>
<p>III. The Development of the Experimental Spirit - The scientific method must be based on precise observation and experimentation, otherwise the conclusions are unreliable. For example, the great Greek philosopher Aristotle said, "When two objects are dropped from above, the heavier one falls faster and the lighter one falls slower." According to general observation, this conclusion seems to be correct, and it is said that for more than two thousand years no one could point out his error, until Galileo used the height of the Leaning Tower of Pisa in the 17th century to drop two iron balls, one weighing one hundred pounds and the other weighing one pound, at the same time, proving that light and heavy objects fall at the same time, and the speed is not related to weight. The experiment itself is very simple, and its fame does not lie in being able to correct Aristotle's error. This experiment demonstrates the greatness of Galileo's experimental spirit. Before, when Galileo discovered the three laws of falling bodies, everyone thought they were inconsistent with Aristotle's theory and denounced them as absurd. Galileo dared to disregard the accusations of the public and led the crowd to conduct the "Leaning Tower Experiment." His experimental spirit was truly great. Because of his scientific views, he was subjected to various persecutions by the church at the time, but his aspirations and views never changed. Later generations called him the ancestor of modern science because of his research and experimental spirit.</p>
<p>IV. The Establishment of Universities and Academic Societies - Universities provide an environment for academic research, and academic societies provide members with opportunities to learn from each other. Both can promote the development of science. At the beginning of the modern period, universities in various European countries were already established. At that time, great scientists such as Copernicus, Kepler, Bacon, Galileo, Newton, etc. all received university education and worked in universities or their research institutions. Universities encouraged scientific research, so science was able to advance rapidly. European academic societies originated in Naples, Italy. This was the first scientific society in the West, founded in 1560. The first scientific society in England was founded in 1645, and the first scientific society in France was founded in 1666. Now, academic societies are established in various countries and are an important factor in promoting science. Academic societies are even more important than universities, because when academic societies hold meetings, each member first presents the research results, and then everyone discusses them, debating and asking questions, which often arouses everyone's interest in research, and sometimes can point out the direction of a person's research or correct his mistakes. The combination of academic societies and universities has created an excellent scientific environment and a strong atmosphere for scientific research.</p>
<p>V. The Invention of Printing and the Flourishing of Scientific Books and Newspapers! - Before the invention of printing, books were mostly copied or carved on stone or wood, and were expensive and difficult for ordinary people to buy. Since the German invented movable type in 1445, more than ten thousand books have been published in Europe in just a few years, which naturally has a great relationship with the progress of science. By the middle of the 17th century, scientists gradually felt the need to communicate with each other, so various academic societies published scientific periodicals. Scientific journals were published in France and England in 1665 at the same time. Scientific journals have three purposes: (1) to publish various research records and reports, so that others can use them as reference when studying the same problem; (2) to communicate with each other to avoid the drawbacks of duplication; (3) to encourage individual research and promote benign competition among scientists. Someone said, "Generally, it takes ten years for a scientific invention to be used as middle school teaching material, but important inventions are published in the newspaper on the same day, and are recorded in magazines within a month or two at most." This statement has considerable reason, so I would like to ask all middle school students to read newspapers and scientific magazines in addition to textbooks, because the progress of science now is definitely something that textbooks cannot keep up with.</p>
<p>The above five reasons are very important. I will give an analogy to help you remember. Science is like the advancement of a train; the Renaissance is like the railway, enabling the train to advance boldly and vigorously; the scientific method is like the locomotive, giving the train the ability to advance; the experimental spirit is like coal, which is the driving force of the train; research institutions and academic societies are like the train itself, carrying many scientists; magazines and publications are like signals, such as traffic lights, indicating the route the train should take. These five conditions were only fully met after one hundred and fifty years, and since then science has been advancing rapidly on the track towards a bright future.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: The Director of the Library Goes Mad and Joins the Rebels</h3>
<p>Wang Delin, the director of the Suzhou Canglang Pavilion Provincial Library, secretly went to Tianjin to participate in Yin Rugeng's puppet autonomous organization in eastern Hebei, taking up the position of committee member and puppet director of education. It is reported that Wang is 38 years old, from Wu County, Zhejiang, and graduated from National Peking University. He was appointed director of the Provincial Suzhou Library in the summer of 1935. Recently, he secretly left his post to engage in activities in Peiping and Tianjin. Unexpectedly, he actually participated in the puppet organization of Yin Rugeng and others. After reading the newspaper, the provincial government believed that Wang's rebellious actions were obvious, so it specifically submitted the matter to the provincial government meeting and dismissed Wang from his post.</p>
<h3>The Suburbs of the City Capture Two Bandits in a Robbery Case</h3>
<p>At the home of Chen Guiquan, a villager in Chengeng Village, Huangtu Bridge, Huangmu Township, on the night of the 27th, more than 20 bandits suddenly arrived, broke down the door, tied up the second son of the victim, and forced him to reveal the location of the stored money. However, they were discovered by a neighbor, who sounded the alarm and gathered the crowd. The bandits, fearing for their safety, fled in a panic. Two bandits, Shen Xuesheng and Wang Changsheng, were captured by the villagers in a brave pursuit. The next morning, the police precinct in charge of the area continued to capture four bandits, Wang Yonghe, Chen Yunsheng, Zhu Guiqing, and Fan Amao, in the wilderness, and seized a pistol and stolen goods. The case was handed over to the Public Security Bureau for investigation on the morning of the 28th.</p>
<h3>Songjiang: A Kidnapping Case Discovered in Tianma Mountain</h3>
<p>Fan Shulou, a villager in Xigang Township, Tianma Mountain, had a normal family situation and could barely make ends meet. Unexpectedly, at around 11:00 p.m. on the 24th, twelve bandits arrived, each holding a pistol and a flashlight, broke into the house, tied up Fan Shulou's son, Jiefa, and beat him in the waist. Then they searched everywhere, but found nothing of value, so they kidnapped Fan Shulou's grandson (the young son of Shengfa), Jinlan, and fled. Before leaving, they also told him to quickly prepare money for ransom. Since his young grandson was kidnapped, the Fan family has been extremely worried.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: An Indian Monk Arrives to Preach</h3>
<p>Indian monk Banama Lun, a graduate of the University of Calcutta with a Bachelor of Arts degree, departed from India last August to investigate the situation of Buddhism in China. He arrived in Wuxi from Shanghai on the 日th and resided in Juesheng Temple in Huishan. Mr. Ba's luggage consisted only of a suitcase, containing two Chinese maps. He speaks fluent English and also understands Chinese. After arriving in Wuxi, he walked alone to visit famous scenic spots such as Meiyuan, Xiao Jishan, and Yuantouzhu. At night, he wrote travel notes in English to prepare for future publication. Mr. Ba stayed in Wuxi for about a week, and then went to Changzhou, Nanjing, and then to Peiping, Japan, and other places for investigation. On the 28th, a incense offering was held at Dianlonghai Temple, and the abbot Dao Ci invited Mr. Ba to the temple to preach, forming a good karmic connection. The venue was crowded with people, which was a grand occasion for a time.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Hai Prefecture Refugees Rob Rice</h3>
<p>At Yutai Rice Store in the north entrance of Taiping Lane, Xi Dou Wai, Wuyi County, at around 9:00 a.m. on the 27th, sixty to seventy refugees from Haizhou who had walked to Changzhou from Xinmin Town suddenly arrived. First, seven or eight men went to the store under the pretext of buying rice, followed by more than twenty women who crowded into the store and poured rice into the cloth bags they carried, taking away three or four dou of white rice in total. Seeing the bad situation, the store immediately telegraphed the first police station in charge of the area, requesting the dispatch of police to maintain order. The station immediately dispatched Police Chief Yin to lead the police to suppress the situation. However, the women who robbed the rice had already fled far away. Then, each refugee was searched one by one, but nothing was found. In order to avoid further disturbances, the station sent more police to escort all the refugees out of the city.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Protecting Sailing Vessels During the Winter Defense Period</h3>
<p>In order to ensure the safety of sailing vessels, the county government has formulated measures for winter vessel protection. All ships passing through townships and stopping are inspected by the military and police. During the winter defense period, remote small ports are closed and navigation is suspended. Regardless of the size of the vessel, no vessel may stop or embark/disembark passengers within the county's boundaries except at designated ports.</p>
<h3>Ningbo: Zhejiang Customs Seizes Smuggled Artificial Silk</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the 26th, the Zhenhai sub-customs received a secret report stating that a large quantity of artificial silk was loaded onto a sailboat and was currently docked near the waters of Donghuoshan. The customs immediately dispatched personnel together with the chief of the Zhenhai County Public Security Bureau to hire the Lianyi Wheel to investigate. As expected, 50 boxes of smuggled artificial silk, worth more than 10,000 yuan, were seized inside the Lu Ri boat. The silk was immediately transported to the Zhejiang Customs for disposal.</p>
<h3>Haimen: Telegram Requesting the Finance Department to Reduce Autumn Harvest</h3>
<p>This county has suffered severe insect plagues this autumn, and the harvest has been sharply reduced. After the county government submitted a report to the Department of Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction requesting the dispatch of personnel to inspect, the harvest was reported to the provincial government for approval at 85%. On the afternoon of the 26th, the county government received instructions from the Finance Department to change it to 90%. A meeting of representatives from various agencies and organizations was immediately convened, and it was decided to telegraph the Finance Department to maintain the 85% assessment in order to alleviate the people's difficulties.</p>

<h3>In the Midst of Denouncing Yin Rugeng, Telegrams Arrive from All Sides</h3>
<p>Since Yin Rugeng openly betrayed the country and established the so-called Eastern Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee, telegrams from various groups in the city requesting the central government to denounce him have been pouring in. Yesterday, the two railway unions sent telegrams to the central government and northern China generals requesting the suppression of the puppet Hebei Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee. The City Chamber of Commerce has received a reply from the National Government, and Mr. Shang Qiyu has also received a reply from the Local Association. The telegrams are recorded separately below.</p>
<p>Reply from the National Government to the City Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The City Chamber of Commerce received a telegram from the National Government yesterday stating, "To the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce, Your telegram has been read by the Chairman and noted. The President has instructed that the nation is in difficulty, and it is up to the entire nation to unite and work together to save the situation. The matters stated in your telegram demonstrate your patriotic loyalty and are deeply appreciated. The rebellious Yin Rugeng has colluded with traitors in an attempt to betray the country and has been dismissed and ordered to be arrested. All administrative inspectors of Aoyu, Jimi, and other districts have been dismissed, and all duties have been handed over to the Hebei Provincial Government for direct handling. He Yingqin has been appointed as the Chief Administrative Officer of the Executive Yuan in Peiping, and Song Zheyuan as the Pacification Director of Hebei, Chahar, and Suiyuan, responsible for stabilizing the people's hearts and suppressing local rebellions. Secretary-General Wei Huaijian of the National Government, respectfully."</p>
<p>Shang Zhen Responds to the Local Association's Telegram</p>
<p>Chairman Shang Qizi of Hebei Province responds to the Shanghai Local Association's telegram, "To the Shanghai Local Association, I have received your telegram. The nation is in great difficulty, and traitors are rampant. Your teachings have only added to my anger. The rebellious [Yin Rugeng] has been dismissed and is under investigation. I have a duty to defend the territory and hate evil as an enemy. Following the central government's orders, I will not hesitate. I hope you will continue to teach me and show me the way. I have expressed my sincerity and hope you will understand. Shang Zhen respectfully, Provincial Secretary."</p>
<p>Two Railway Unions Telegraph Request for Suppression</p>
<p>The Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Unions, directly under the Ministry of Railways, telegraphed to the central government and northern China generals yesterday, requesting the extermination of the pseudo Hebei Provincial Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee. The original text is extracted below: (Telegram 1) To the Central Executive Committee, Chairman Lin of the National Government, Premier Kong of the Executive Yuan, and Chairman Jiang of the Military Affairs Commission, I have read your telegram. It is reported that the rebellious Yin Rugeng fabricated public opinion, was used by others, and conspired to rebel. On the 日th, he established the Hebei Provincial Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee in Tong County, openly declaring independence, betraying the country, destroying the territory, and going to extremes. The news has spread and caused deep indignation. At this critical moment of national survival, how can we allow villains to seize and divide, endangering the country? We hereby telegraph, requesting a clear order for suppression, to curb the source of chaos, consolidate our borders, and determine the national policy. We urgently submit this request, and we hope you will take it into consideration. The Two Railway Unions respectfully, (Telegram 2) To Commander Song of the Peiping Garrison Command, Chairman Shang of the Hebei Provincial Government, Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government, and Mayor Cheng of Tianjin, I have read your telegram. The rebellious Yin Rugeng betrayed the country and established the Hebei Provincial Anti-Communist Autonomous Committee in Tong County on the 日th, destroying the territory and falsely claiming independence. The people of the entire country have risen up to denounce him. You are loyal and patriotic, defending the country, and stationed in northern China. The central government relies on you, and the nation looks to you. We hope that you will decisively eliminate the rebels, protect the territory in its entirety, prevent conspiracies from succeeding, and ensure the safety of the whole situation. I sincerely express this and respectfully request your consideration. The Two Railway Unions respectfully.</p>

<h3>Sanbei Company's River Steamer: Changxing Stranded in Zhenjiang; Hengshan Already Heading to Rescue</h3>
<p>Sanbei Company received a telegram yesterday afternoon from the Yangtze River steamer Changxing, stating that it was stranded above Zhenjiang and had taken on water. The company is currently sending a vessel to rescue it. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Encountered Fog En Route</p>
<p>The Changxing vessel has a large capacity and many passenger seats, making it a leading first-class ship among the company's Yangtze River vessels. Captain Jia Dingxiu has a deep reputation and is a senior veteran among Chinese pilots. He has a long tenure and can always turn danger into safety. On Tuesday night of this week at 2 a.m., the vessel departed from Shanghai, sailing upstream to Wuhan, fully loaded with cargo.</p>
<p>Vessel Stranded</p>
<p>After midnight on the 27th, the vessel was traveling above Zhenjiang, near Twelve Fort, at a place called Shihyeh Chow. Due to the heavy fog and rain at that late hour, the river pilot mistakenly navigated to shallow waters, causing the vessel to run aground. The captain measured the waterline on the starboard side and found that the vessel's heavy cargo caused it to sit deep in the water. He planned to try to dislodge the vessel himself at high tide, as there is a difference of seven to twelve feet between high and low tide.</p>
<p>Reported to Shanghai by Telegram</p>
<p>Two hours after running aground, Captain Jia attempted to reverse at full speed to free the vessel. However, water was discovered in the engine room, making self-rescue impossible. Yesterday afternoon, two telegrams were sent to Shanghai, reporting the situation of the Changxing's grounding and the flooding of the vessel.</p>
<p>Hengshan Heading to Rescue</p>
<p>The Changxing vessel departed from Shanghai carrying over 11,000 pieces of cargo and a significant number of passengers bound for Wuhan. Passengers panicked after the grounding. Yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m., another telegram was received from Captain Zheng stating that the company's Hengshan vessel was passing through the area and had been requested to assist in the rescue. If it can be rescued, that would be best. If the rescue is unsuccessful, other measures will be considered, such as unloading the cargo from the vessel.</p>
<h3>Pilots Association Strives: Prioritize Hiring Chinese Crew; Break the Habit of Preferring Foreign Crew; Request the Navigation Bureau to Enforce</h3>
<p>The Chinese Merchant Marine Pilots Association has petitioned the Ministry of Communications to instruct the Navigation Bureau to enforce the prioritization of hiring Chinese crew members to help unemployed Chinese crew. The full text of the petition is as follows: "Petition for the enforcement of prioritizing the employment of Chinese crew members for the sake of many unemployed national crew members. It is requested that an order be issued not to be deceived by foreigners. We have found that since China opened its seas, we have had to rely on talent from other countries due to the lack of navigational expertise. This led to the loss of maritime rights, which was a painful but necessary measure at the time. Fortunately, in recent years, the country has spared no effort in cultivating navigational talent. According to the current statistics of Chinese crew members, there are enough to serve Chinese merchant vessels, and there is no need to rely on foreigners. Some shipping companies do support Chinese crew members, but many still prefer to hire foreign crew members, leading to a significant number of unemployed Chinese crew members. In order to provide relief, our association has petitioned your ministry to instruct the Navigation Bureau to order all shipping companies to prioritize hiring Chinese crew members when recruiting crew members. Your ministry approved this petition and instructed all companies to comply. The companies should strictly abide by the ministry's order to create job opportunities for Chinese crew members. However, we have recently discovered that some shipping companies, such as the Northern Shipping Company's Beihang vessel, hired a foreign first mate to replace another who was transferred. The Shanghai Navigation Bureau informed them of the ministry's order and demanded compliance, ordering them to dismiss the foreign first mate and quickly hire a Chinese replacement. The company was forced to comply with the law. However, we have recently heard that the foreign first mate, holding a valid first mate certificate, claims that he should have the right to perform his duties and that the Shanghai Navigation Bureau should not refuse to clear him, and will appeal to your ministry. We believe that the Navigation Bureau, given the large number of unemployed Chinese crew members, should prioritize hiring Chinese nationals when the company recruits crew members, as a means of providing relief, and should not refuse clearance to the foreign crew member. This is a legitimate action that both upholds the law and helps unemployed Chinese crew members. Our association is deeply concerned that your ministry will listen to only one side of the story and be deceived by the foreigner. If this happens, not only will the Navigation Bureau find it difficult to enforce the law in the future, but the number of unemployed Chinese crew members will increase. Furthermore, the Northern Shipping Company has always been dominated by foreign crew members. If we do not fight for it this time and allow the company to hire another foreign crew member, it is feared that Chinese crew members will never find employment with that company. Therefore, we urgently petition your ministry to order the Navigation Bureau to enforce the law of prioritizing the employment of Chinese crew members. If foreigners file complaints, please investigate carefully and not be deceived. This will be a great virtue."</p>
<h3>Social Bureau: Regulates Silver Dime Exchange Rate; Yesterday Ordered the Chamber of Commerce and the Banking Association to Discuss and Report</h3>
<p>The Municipal Social Bureau, upon receiving a petition from the Civil Federation of the First Special District of the city to restrict the exchange rate of silver dimes, issued orders to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Banking Association yesterday: "According to the report submitted by the Civil Federation of the First Special District of this city, 'Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the reform of the currency system on the third of this month, the market was temporarily chaotic at the beginning, but it quickly returned to normal. However, unscrupulous merchants have been engaging in selfish activities, and there have been rumors of buying silver-content coins, resulting in extremely disparate exchange rates on the market, ranging from the regulated rate of twelve dimes to less than eleven dimes, and sometimes even ten dimes and three hundred cash. As the use of legal tender begins, people's hearts are initially stabilized, but unscrupulous merchants dare to create such a fraudulent market to disrupt people's hearts, which should be strictly prohibited. We hereby submit this report to your bureau, requesting that you, together with the Public Security Bureau, etc., strictly investigate and arrest these fraudsters to restore order. We respectfully submit this to the Shanghai Social Bureau for your consideration.'" According to this, the report is indeed true. This matter concerns finance and should be strictly investigated. In addition to issuing orders, we hereby order your association to promptly discuss and report with the local banking association and the local chamber of commerce so that we may review and handle this matter. This order is issued."</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Beiping Flights: Still Heading North as Usual Yesterday</h3>
<p>According to the Guowen News Agency, although the Japanese troops occupying the Fengtai Railway Station and the Tianjin civil airport have withdrawn, there are still a small number of Japanese soldiers stationed at both locations, according to yesterday's news. A reporter inquired with the China National Aviation Corporation about air transportation between Shanghai and Beiping due to the airport being occupied, which affects civil aviation traffic. According to the company, the Shanghai-Beiping northbound plane will still fly as usual this morning. Although there are reports of Japanese troops stationed at the airport, the southbound plane from the previous day still arrived in Shanghai as usual, indicating that there are no obstacles to transportation. The Shanghai-Beiping flights will continue to operate as usual.</p>
<h3>Shanghai-Chengdu Downbound Flight: Safely Arrived in Zhengzhou Yesterday; Continuing Flight to Shanghai This Morning</h3>
<p>The Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Sichuan-Shaanxi-Shanghai route was originally scheduled to arrive on the same day. The downbound flight on that route departed from Chengdu at 8 a.m. the day before yesterday. Around 10 a.m., while flying over the Qinling Mountains, the weather changed drastically, with dark clouds gathering and visibility severely reduced. Fortunately, the blind-flying instruments were fully equipped, allowing the plane to continue flying at high altitude and safely reach Xi'an. Subsequently, a telegram was received stating that there was heavy snow in the Zhengzhou area, so the plane was delayed in Xi'an, waiting for the weather to improve before continuing the flight. According to news from the company yesterday, the plane had departed from Xi'an yesterday morning and safely arrived in Zhengzhou at noon. It is scheduled to continue the flight to Shanghai this morning.

<h3>Beijing-Shanghai Railway: Derailment Locomotive Repaired</h3>
<p>The derailment of a freight train locomotive on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway at Hushu Pass Station the night before last has been reported in various newspapers. The true story of the derailment, as investigated, is continued below. According to reports, at 9:20 p.m. the night before last (the 27th), after freight train No. 503 on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway arrived at Hushu Pass Station, locomotive No. B-46 was detached and driven from the bend to the east end of the station's siding, then reversed back onto the main track in preparation for towing other vehicles. Unexpectedly, while the single locomotive was reversing onto the main track, two large wheels and the water tank car wheels derailed simultaneously, blocking the track. The railway promptly dispatched rescue trains from Changzhou and Shangbei to provide assistance. At 2:20 a.m., all the derailed wheels were returned to the track, and the entire line was operating normally after 3:00 a.m. Due to the derailment, passenger trains No. 3 and No. 80 arrived at the scene of the accident.

<h3>Famine Refugees Sell Children: Westerner Appeals on Their Behalf</h3>
<p>Yesterday, a Westerner submitted the following letter to this newspaper for translation and publication: "Returning home on Sunday evening, walking west on Difeng Road near St. George's, I saw two men and two women next to a stone wall. Each woman held a baby. As I approached, the two men spoke in a northern dialect, saying 'Selling children,' shouting it two or three times. The plaintive sound pierced my heart and will never be forgotten. I hope that readers who are sleeping soundly in their warm beds at night can also hear it. I asked them where they came from and learned that they were all honest farmers from the north, who had fled to Shanghai due to the drought and famine. Unfortunately, although Shanghai is prosperous, it is also frighteningly indifferent. They had no relatives or friends and their meager savings were quickly exhausted. Therefore, they had no choice but to sell one of their children in order to get a few days' worth of food to survive. I gave them all the money I had in my pockets so they could buy food to eat, and then asked for help from the patrolman at the intersection. He said there was no place for them. I then asked the New Royal Hotel for assistance, hoping to find some spare space where the suffering people could find shelter from the wind and frost, but they refused, saying there was no room. I then consulted with the Salvation Army, which has hostels for foreigners and shelters for released prisoners, but does not accept honest farmers fleeing from famine. I then pleaded with one of China's largest churches, but they also closed their doors. Finally, I inquired with the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association, who treated me with courtesy, but also said they could not accommodate refugees arriving in Shanghai. Alas, where can these hungry crows roost? Or why are they being rejected by everyone?"</p>
<h3>Antiquities Exports Must Be Declared: Education and Interior Ministries Issue Passports: Jianghai Customs Announces</h3>
<p>Jianghai Customs Announcement to the Public Regarding Antiquities Exports Requiring Submission for Verification, Education and Interior Ministries Jointly Issuing Passports: Announcement: By order of the Ministry of Finance, the circulation of antiquities is limited to domestic use.

<h3>City Federation Petitions the Municipal Government: Stop Increasing Raw Material Prices; and Distribute Letters to Various Industries to Monitor Each Other</h3>
<p>The Civil Federation of the First Special District of this city sent a document to the Municipal Government yesterday, titled "Petition to Stop the Price Increase of Raw Materials." The document stated, "We have found that recently, raw material manufacturers in Shanghai have been taking advantage of the currency reform to increase prices, but the prices of finished goods cannot be increased simultaneously due to weak purchasing power, causing difficulties for small factories. The Federation convened a joint meeting of various groups and decided to petition your government to strictly prohibit this behavior to avoid causing panic. We respectfully submit this document for your consideration and implementation." The Federation also distributed letters to various trade associations, requesting them to instruct their members to monitor each other to prevent arbitrary price increases.</p>
<h3>Shipping Industry to Increase Cargo Fees by 20% Starting January 1st Next Year: Due to Increased Prices of Hardware and Coal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Shipping Industry Association received instructions from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which had been forwarded by the Social Bureau, prohibiting price increases during the government's currency policy implementation, and requiring them to submit proposed reasonable prices to the bureau for record-keeping. The Shipping Industry Association responded that the member companies are currently facing higher operating costs due to rising prices and have requested the association to review the situation. This matter was submitted to the 37th Executive Committee meeting on the 22nd of this month for discussion. The committee members agreed that the value of ships has increased and the prices of hardware, materials, machinery, and iron plates have soared due to exchange rate issues. Other essential items such as coal have also increased in price. All expenses have increased significantly compared to the past. At a time when the shipping industry is declining, this sudden increase in burden makes it difficult to sustain operations. If no remedies are taken, it will be difficult to maintain the status quo. The only source of income for shipping companies is cargo fees. Since expenses have increased, they must find ways to compensate from the income side to survive. Shipping expenses are like the cost of goods. When the cost of goods increases, the price naturally follows. This is a matter of common sense and should not be compared with speculative attempts to deliberately raise prices. In this environment, shipping companies have no choice but to increase cargo fees to some extent to make up the difference.

In your letter, the eight shareholders each hold a copy of the contract, which is stamped. The other copy is held by the manager, who does not have any shares. The manager does not hold this as proof of rights, but only for verification purposes. Therefore, this is a copy as referred to in Article 3 of the Implementing Rules and does not need to be stamped. However, the word 'copy' should be noted on the contract to avoid confusion by the inspectors."</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: New River Steamer Bidding Opened Yesterday: Resumption of Yangtze River Service Temporarily Difficult</h3>

<h3>Domestic and Foreign Wireless Telephone to Open; Ministry of Communications Orders Shanghai Telegraph Bureau to Improve Long-Distance Lines</h3>
<p>The Daily News reports that the Ministry of Communications yesterday instructed the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, stating, "The international and domestic wireless telephone services planned by this Ministry are about to open for business. The construction of long-distance telephone trunk lines connecting various provinces is underway and will soon be completed in stages. To ensure clear communication, the urban telephone lines connected to the aforementioned wireless telephones and long-distance trunk lines must be improved to meet the telephone circuit transmission standards promulgated by this Ministry. After investigation, it has been found that the resistance of the supervisory signal coils within the cord circuits of small exchanges installed by long-distance telephone users is generally low, resulting in very low impedance, which is detrimental to long-distance communication. Each such case should be inspected, and those with the aforementioned circumstances must have their supervisory signal coils replaced, or one pair in the cord circuit can be modified into a straight-through type specifically for long-distance communication. Furthermore, the telephones used by users to connect to domestic and foreign wireless telephones and national long-distance trunk lines are of great importance to the volume of communication and should also be carefully selected and inspected from time to time to ensure they are suitable for long-distance communication. You are hereby instructed to comply and implement the above. The Shanghai Telephone Bureau, Jinan Bureau, and Hangzhou Bureau are to separately notify the Shanghai Telephone Company, Jinan Telephone Company, and Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau to comply accordingly and report on the implementation status. Minister Zhu Jia驊."</p>

<h3>Municipal Public Utilities Bureau; Stipulates Taxi Fares for City Center; Xiang Sheng Company Willing to Comply</h3>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education; Convenes Biao Biao Opera Actors for Training; More Than 30 Actors Including Bai Yushuang Attend; Section Chief Jiang Instructs on Areas for Improvement</h3>
<p>The Municipal Bureau of Education, recognizing that the Biao Biao operas performed by Bai Yushuang and others at the Empire Theatre and the North China Opera Theatre are obscene, has been sending personnel to review them daily, banning or censoring them separately. Yesterday, it specially convened all the actors for training at 10:00 a.m. in the lecture hall of the Citizens' Education Center. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attendees: Including Section Chief Jiang Jianbai of the Municipal Bureau of Education, Lei Kenan of the Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs, Lu Hailan, Yuan Zengyu, Ding Shoutang, and Sun Yucai of the Opera and Record Review Committee, and actors Bai Yushuang, Chen Peigen, Guo Yunfang, Wang Shaolun, Xian Lingzhi, Ai Lianjun, Wang Baolan, Sai Lingfa, Xiao Yufeng, Li Guiqin, Ya Lijun, Zhang Xiangzhong, Mao Enqiang, Zhao Yueting, and others, more than 30 people.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report: Chairman Cai, Section Chief, began by stating, "The Municipal Bureau of Education has convened everyone here today, hoping that after this conversation, there will be improvements. Shanghai is a place where people from all over gather, with a dense population. Various entertainment groups have been organized and guided by the Bureau of Education from time to time. However, there are not many Biao Biao opera performers, so there has been no opportunity to talk. The Bureau of Education has sent personnel to review, and they feel that the content and review standards are quite inconsistent. It should be strictly banned, but considering the livelihood of the actors, we are giving them an opportunity to improve. We know that drama today is no longer as despised by the general public as it used to be. Drama is social education. The strength or weakness of a country depends entirely on education. China's weakness and stagnation are due to the lack of widespread education. To popularize education, we rely on school education on the one hand and social education on the other. To ensure that all social dynamics contain good educational meaning, the general public will be educated through what they see and hear. Drama is even more widespread education and can influence countless audiences. Therefore, in terms of performance, we must pay close attention and not allow the audience to become depressed or extreme as a result of watching the play. We must be able to give the audience a good effect. The drama review standards prohibit anything that violates the Three Principles of the People, loses the national image, harms public safety or morals, or promotes superstition, heresies, or feudal ideology. There is a lot of obscenity in Biao Biao opera. We hope that you will pay attention to the singing, dialogue, expressions, and movements, and also improve the script. You are all teachers of the people. We hope to work with educators to be good social teachers, whose power is even greater than that of elementary school teachers."</p>
<p>Review Opinions: Next, Lei Kenan, a representative of the Bureau of Social Affairs, gave a speech, hoping that actors would improve their knowledge to improve themselves. Then, Lu Hailan, a member of the Opera and Record Review Committee, reported on the review opinions and the areas that should be improved: (1) In terms of tone, do not have obscene puns; (2) In terms of tone, do not have decadent music; (3) Do not have obscene movements; (4) Horror plots, such as killing children for revenge, are prohibited; (5) Actors should not have behaviors that seduce the audience; (6) The insertion of other elements should not be overly exaggerated. If you can do these points, you can get on the right track.</p>
<p>Representative's Response: Finally, Wang Shaolun, a representative of the actors, gave a speech, stating, "Today, we are grateful for the invitation and training by the Municipal Bureau of Education, and we accept and thank you for your instructions. Biao Biao opera has been performed in Shanghai for a year. This opera is most popular in Tanggu and Jinzhou in the north, and it is done by two or three people playing the basin drum in a grass band. It is very low-class. Therefore, the two groups performing in Shanghai this time are no longer Biao Biao opera. It is the same status as Ping opera and Ping opera, but the erhu and bangzi are slightly different. However, in order to cater to the psychology of the general public, the name is still used. Because the plot of this play is very old, there are many things that do not fit the times. We hope that you will guide us to improve it."</p>

<h3>County Government Reaffirms Previous Order; Branding Superior Cattle; Severe Punishment Upon Discovery</h3>
<p>Shanghai County Government issued Public Notice Min No. 1527 yesterday, stating, "According to the report submitted by Zhang Yi, Director of the Zhuanqiao Public Education Center of the County, on November 19th of the 24th year of the Republic of China, 'The Rural Improvement Association of Zhuanqiao held its 32nd Rural Improvement Meeting on November 16th.

<h3>Ningbo Bank Recovery Rumors; Creditor Sues; Demands Repayment of Deposits; Defendant Hopes to Settle</h3>
<p>Wu Zhihao, a wealthy businessman from Ningbo, previously founded the Ningbo Industrial Bank on Nanjing Road in Shanghai. Due to financial difficulties, it announced its closure on June 5th of this year. It is currently preparing to resume operations. According to the recovery plan, creditors will be repaid 20% in cash first, 30% will be a two-year term deposit, and the remaining 50% will be used as the bank's capital after it resumes operations. Seven out of ten creditors have agreed. Now, 51 creditors, including Gu Jiating, have jointly hired lawyers Chen Kunyuan and Liu Yan to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against the bank's directors Wu Zhihao, He Shaoting, Yu Guozhen, Wang Boyuan, Zeng Guohua, Wu Zhihe, Chen Cuifu, Dong Zhongxiu, Yang Songren, Zhuo Yuting, Sun Yihan, Xiang Shengwu, Zhou Yongsheng, He Shaoyu, Lin Kanghou, and supervisors Zhuang Songfu, Guo Yonglan, Yuan Duanfu, and Lu Qisheng, totaling 19 people. The object of their claim is divided into two parts: (1) A ruling that the Ningbo Industrial Bank's assets should be liquidated to repay the 43 plaintiffs' savings deposits of 11,698 yuan and 6 jiao. If this is not enough to repay the outstanding deposits, the 19 defendants should be jointly and severally liable for the repayment; (2) The Ningbo Industrial Bank's assets should be liquidated to repay the 11 plaintiffs' current deposits of 1,574 yuan, 3 jiao, and 7 fen, and they should bear their litigation costs separately. According to Article 15 of the Savings Bank Law, the directors and supervisors should be jointly and severally liable for the repayment. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Daxi of the First Special Court convened a hearing in Civil Court No. 13. Only four defendants, Wu Zhihao, Wang Boyuan, Xiang Shengwu, and Lin Kanghou, arrived with lawyers Yu Hualong, Zheng Wenbang, and Wu Baotai. First, the plaintiff's lawyer stated the reasons for the lawsuit and requested a default judgment against the defendants who did not appear. The defense lawyer for Wu Zhihao stated that the Ningbo Industrial Bank has been approved by the Ministry of Finance to resume operations, and seven out of ten creditors have signed subscription agreements. Shao Quan, one of the plaintiffs in this case, has already received the deposit and returned the deposit certificate. Zhou Xiangguang and Wu Peigao, also plaintiffs, have agreed to the recovery plan and signed the subscription agreement. Some of the plaintiffs have also settled. Therefore, this case should be settled. The lawyers for Lin Kanghou and Xiang Shengwu denied that Lin and Xiang were directors of the bank. The court, considering that this case still requires investigation and summoning the plaintiffs, adjourned the case to be heard again at a later date.</p>
<h3>French Concession: Car Theft Ring Cracked; Four Criminals Sentenced</h3>
<p>The French police, led by Detective Xu Kai (transliteration), Chinese Detective Zhou Ruzhang, and Officer Peng Zhengyou, recently cracked a ring specializing in the theft of rickshaws (referred to as "pulling yellow oxen" in their jargon). They arrested Zhili An, a Jiangbei native responsible for the thefts, and Zhou Chuanfa, who managed transportation. In a house at 167 Haig Road, which served as their base, they recovered five stolen rickshaws. They then apprehended Zhao Yongnian and Shen Weiqing, who were guarding the stolen goods.</p>
<p>Taken to the police station, Zhili An and others confessed that Liu Wenkui (aka Xiao Wuzi) and Zhao Kaisi were the ringleaders, that Rong Tiancai was responsible for contacting rickshaw owners to negotiate ransom, and that Tang Xiaoshunzi, Yang Tiancheng, and others posed as passengers to plan thefts.</p>
<p>The detectives went to arrest Liu and the other five, but they had caught wind of the operation and fled. Therefore, Zhili An, Zhou Chuanfa, Zhao Yongnian, and Shen Weiqing were presented along with twelve victims to the Second Special Court, where public prosecution was initiated according to law. Judge Li Changnian held a court hearing to investigate the situation. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper.</p>
<p>The interrogation in this case has now concluded. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Li presided over the first criminal court and sentenced Zhi Anli to three years in prison for habitual theft. Zhou Chuanfa, a repeat offender of theft, was sentenced to two years and six months. Zhao Yongnian and Shen Weiqing were each sentenced to four months for harboring stolen goods. Shen Weiqing received a two-year suspended sentence. During the appeal period, Shen Weiqing was allowed to be released on bail, while the others were returned to the detention center to await transfer to prison after the appeal period. Since this cracking down and punishment of thieves, this trend can be curbed, and rickshaw owners can enjoy a period of peace.</p>
<h3>University Student Sentenced for Abusing Servant Boy; Combined Sentence of One Year and Two Months</h3>
<p>Zhong Qichang, a twenty-three-year-old student from Pinghu, Zhejiang, residing at 36 Shikang Lane, Avenue Joffre, French Concession, bought Lai Fa, the son of his neighbor Qing A'long, in his hometown two years ago as a servant for seventeen yuan. He brought him to Shanghai and forced him to do adult work. He also made him serve Zhong's opium smoking every night until 2:00 or 3:00 AM before he could sleep.</p>
<p>If Lai Fa was careless in his work or dozed off at night, he would be whipped and abused in every way, making the child's life unbearable. His body was covered in wounds, a truly inhumane situation. The second landlord advised Zhong to stop, but to no avail. On the 15th of this month at 2:00 AM, Zhong severely beat Lai Fa again, causing swelling and injuries to his head and body. The second landlord, who was actually French police officer Li Liansheng, reported it to the French police, who arrested Zhong. A search uncovered weapons such as rattan canes and wooden sticks, as well as opium paraphernalia. Lai Fa was taken into custody.</p>
<p>The Legal Affairs Office of the Police Department initiated public prosecution on charges of restricting freedom, enslavement, assault, and opium use, according to the criminal law. Criminal Court President Wang Gangxu conducted a thorough investigation and set a date for sentencing. The details have been reported in previous issues. Yesterday was the sentencing date. At 10:00 AM, Judge Li Changnian presided over the first criminal court and ordered the defendant to be brought to the stand. Zhong Qichang was sentenced to six months imprisonment for abusing a male under the age of sixteen and hindering his natural physical development, one year imprisonment for enslavement, and a fine of sixty yuan for opium use. He was given a combined sentence of one year and two months imprisonment. The fine was included in the execution of his sentence. The charge of assault was not accepted. If the fine is converted to labor, it will be at a rate of two yuan per day. Lai Fa was permitted to be adopted by Pan Jishi (Lai Fa's biological older brother), who provided a guarantee. If no guarantee is provided, he would be sent to the Xin Pu Yu Tang orphanage.</p>
<p>During the appeal period, the defendant was held in the detention center. His defense lawyer requested bail. After deliberation, the court granted bail upon payment of five thousand yuan and a guarantee to appear whenever summoned.</p>
<h3>Counterfeit Currency Dealers Arrested; Three Defendants Remanded for Further Interrogation Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Chen Deshan, a native of Henan, and Cheng Daosheng, a native of Anhui, were in the business of selling counterfeit currency. The other day, Chen and Cheng went to the Taihexiang Cigarette and Paper Shop at 354 Avenue Edward VII to peddle counterfeit money. The shop feigned interest, and they agreed on a price of thirty-four yuan in silver for every hundred yuan of new counterfeit notes from the Bank of China. However, due to the greater ease of using older counterfeit notes, the price was raised by one yuan, making the price thirty-five yuan per hundred yuan. The delivery was scheduled for the previous evening.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the plan was leaked to Chief Inspector Feng Zhiming and Detective Wu Hanzhang of the Inspectorate General. The two officers, along with French Inspector Brett, waited outside the Taihexiang Cigarette and Paper Shop around 8:00 PM the previous evening. Soon enough, Chen and Cheng arrived and were whispering to each other nearby. They were apprehended by the officers. Thirty new counterfeit one-yuan notes from the Bank of China were found on Chen, and one new and one old counterfeit one-yuan note were found on Cheng. They then went to 141 Zhifu Road and apprehended another accomplice, Zhang Churong, a native of Anhui, and found another counterfeit one-yuan note on him. All three were taken to the Xinzha Police Station and detained.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Legal Advisor Zhang Tianyin of the Police Department presented the case to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court, charging them with counterfeiting currency in violation of Article 196 of the Criminal Law. Chen Deshan confessed that the counterfeit money was given to him by Hou Cuixi, who is at large, at Pingjiang Lane in Ximen, who asked Cheng to find a way to sell it. Cheng Daosheng also admitted to peddling the money to Taihexiang. Zhang Churong claimed that the counterfeit one-yuan note found on him was given to him by Chen.</p>
<p>Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the confessions and ordered the three defendants remanded in custody for further interrogation on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3>Policeman's Handgun Snatched; Assailants' Actions Seemingly Planned</h3>
<p>In the early hours of the morning, around 2:00 AM, Officer Li Changsheng, stationed at post number 19 at the intersection of Qiujiang Road in Zhabei, was on duty when two assailants suddenly approached. One was wearing a cotton robe and the other a Zhongshan suit. They initially lingered around the officer. Then, taking advantage of his unguarded state, the one in the robe suddenly threw a rock at his head, hitting him hard in the back of the head, causing him to bleed profusely. At the same time, the two men rushed forward, grabbing the officer tightly and snatching his number 73212 six-inch Browning handgun and six bullets.</p>
<p>They fled in different directions and disappeared without a trace. Officer Li tried his best to chase them, but it was too late. He immediately reported to Chief Zhang, who ordered Detective Team Leader Li Xiaobao to conduct a thorough investigation to apprehend the perpetrators. The incident was also reported to the main bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Using Deceptive Tactics to Lure Back Victim; Fraudulently Claiming and Spending Compensation; Zhang Ke-shi and Others Falsely Accuse Police Chief of Embezzlement</h3>
<p>Wu Jinbao, a 63-year-old man from Anhui, residing at 81 Daji Road, was knocked down by a car driven by a foreigner named Huatesun on the 3rd of August on Minguo Road, Xinbeimen. He was taken to Nanyang Hospital for treatment but died on the 5th due to his old age. Wu's daughter, Zhang Wu-shi, hired lawyer Huang Menggang to negotiate with the foreigner and pursue legal action.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Zhang Wu-shi's sister-in-law, Zhang Ke-shi, along with her husband Zhang Zhikui (aka Xiao Mazi), persuaded her to return to her hometown to save expenses. Zhang Wu-shi then returned to her hometown. Not long after, Zhang Zhikui also returned to their hometown and told her that the foreigner had offered eight hundred yuan in compensation for her father's death, but the police chief in charge had embezzled it. He also said that the hospital had already filed a lawsuit regarding the medical expenses, and that she should not go to Shanghai to avoid further trouble.</p>
<p>Zhang Wu-shi believed this to be true, but the next day she received a letter from lawyer Huang, informing her that the compensation money was available and instructing her to come to Shanghai to claim it. Upon arriving in Shanghai, she secretly investigated and discovered that Zhang Ke-shi, Zhang Zhikui, Su Xue-shi, and others had schemed to impersonate her and collect 550 silver dollars in compensation from the foreigner Huatesun, which they then divided and spent.</p>
<p>Therefore, she requested lawyer Huang to send a letter to the Yimiao Police Station to investigate. Police Chief Liu discovered that Zhang Ke-shi and her husband had dared to fraudulently claim the compensation money, falsely accused the police chief of embezzlement, and intimidated the plaintiff, which was extremely illegal. He immediately dispatched Officer Shi, together with the French police, to 94 Balijiao Road, where they arrested Zhang Ke-shi and Su Xue-shi and brought them to the station. After confirming the facts through interrogation, they were handed over to the main bureau for strict punishment.</p>
<h3>Huikang Steamer is Out of Danger; Repaired the Hole… Sails Back to Shanghai on its Own</h3>
<p>It has been previously reported in this newspaper that the Huikang steamer of the Huitung Company ran aground after hitting a reef north of Dazu Island, Quanzhou. Yesterday, we learned that the ship telegraphed that the crew of the Huikang steamer had repaired the large hole in the rudder, pumped out the accumulated water, and managed to pull the ship off the shoal. It can now sail back to Shanghai on its own. The company has already notified the insurance consortium.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau Urges Expediting Winter Relief Shelters and Soup Kitchens</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau establishes winter relief shelters and soup kitchens every year, given the large number of poor people who inevitably suffer from cold and hunger. This year, due to floods in various regions, many refugees have fled their homes in search of food. The bureau has specially instructed charitable organizations in the city to prepare as soon as possible.</p>
<p>We understand that charitable organizations in Shanghai have begun planning since receiving the instructions from the Social Affairs Bureau. Fundraising is also underway. Once the funds are raised and the locations of the winter relief shelters and soup kitchens are determined, the Social Affairs Bureau will be notified again so that they can be opened as soon as possible.</p>
<h3>Student's Absurd and Outrageous Act: Falsely Accuses Teacher of Being a Communist; Teacher Reports Himself to the Police, Truth Comes to Light; Student Sentenced to Three Months Imprisonment, Suspended for Two Years</h3>
<p>Zhang Menghen, a practitioner of traditional Chinese medicine from Qingpu, in addition to practicing medicine at 24 Yuehua Lane, Jingzhou Road, also had his wife open Xinhua Primary School at the same location. Gong Wenhao, a seventeen-year-old native of the same county, had been learning medicine from Zhang. One time, Gong had not come for a week and had not asked for leave. Afterwards, Zhang reprimanded him, which Gong resented. The other day, Gong sent a letter to the Huishan Police Station, falsely accusing his teacher of being a communist. Another classmate, Zhao Fujun, saw the letter and secretly reported it to Zhang Menghen. Zhang questioned Gong, but Gong firmly denied it.</p>
<p>Therefore, the previous afternoon, Zhang took Gong and Zhao to the Huishan Police Station and requested an investigation. The police station had just received Gong's letter and ordered an investigation. Because Zhang and the others had already arrived at the police station, Detective Wang Tongpo conducted an investigation. Gong initially denied it, but eventually admitted the truth. Gong was detained and brought to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District yesterday morning. Legal Advisor Zhang Shizhu of the Police Department explained the situation, charged him with false accusation in violation of Article 169 of the Criminal Law, and stated that the defendant was not yet eighteen years old and should be treated with leniency. Zhang Menghen then submitted a written account of the incident and stated that, due to the defendant's actions, his life and property were in grave danger, and that he might file a civil suit.</p>
<p>When questioned, Gong Wenhao confessed that he had a history of nervous disorders, and that he was stimulated by the plaintiff's reprimand, causing him to do this absurd thing. He then confessed to the plaintiff. Judge Jiang Shuzi reviewed the confessions and sentenced Gong Wenhao to three months imprisonment for false accusation, suspended for two years. During the probation period, he was placed under the supervision of his mother, Gong Wang-shi.</p>
<h3>Charity Organizations Plan Winter Relief Shelters, Request City Government to Allocate Funds for Subsidies</h3>
<p>Wang Yiting and other members of the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Association believe that in recent years, disasters have been frequent in various provinces, rural areas are bankrupt, and industry and commerce are in a state of extreme decline. Many poor people and disaster victims are gathering in Shanghai. With winter approaching, they lack clothing and food, which is extremely pitiful. Therefore, they convened a meeting on the 21st to discuss opening the winter relief shelters early. Yesterday, they sent a letter to the Social Affairs Bureau requesting that the city government allocate additional funds.</p>
<p>The original text of the letter is as follows: "In reply, we acknowledge receipt of your letter instructing us to prepare for the winter relief shelters early, etc. Our association convened a meeting of various charitable organizations on the 21st of this month. All agreed that the city is in decline this year, rural areas are bankrupt, industry and commerce are stagnant, the number of unemployed is increasing, and since the floods in various provinces, disaster victims are flocking to Shanghai, lacking clothing and food and urgently needing relief. The winter relief shelters should be prepared early, following the same methods as last year, borrowing the Chaozhou Guild Hall on South Railway Station Road as the first shelter and the Chao Hui Shanzhuang on Xietu Road as the second shelter. We will expand the shelters after the two shelters are full. However, the Chao Hui Shanzhuang is currently occupied by security troops. Our association will find a house for them and negotiate their relocation. We also request that your bureau send personnel to contact the troops to facilitate the matter, as the Chao Hui Shanzhuang has a larger building, which can accommodate over three thousand people. At this time of financial difficulty, rather than establishing multiple shelters and spending more, it is better to combine them into one place, which is more economical. Therefore, it is necessary for the security troops to relocate. The reception period is expected to begin around December 10th. If the weather turns cold suddenly, it will be advanced at any time. Now we are preparing all the necessary matters. As for the reception expenses, each charitable organization will donate at the meeting on the 21st, totaling over eleven thousand yuan. However, based on past years' expenditures, at least twenty thousand yuan is needed. This year the number of people to be accommodated will definitely increase, and expenses will definitely increase. The amount donated by each charitable organization is far from enough, and fundraising is extremely difficult. The city government has allocated three thousand yuan each year. The difficult situation this year is even worse than in previous years. We earnestly request your bureau to forward a request to the city government to allocate an additional two thousand yuan in addition to the usual three thousand yuan. Any additional amount will be raised by our association to cope with the situation. In addition to notifying you of the scheduled reception, we respectfully reply and request your review and processing.</p>

The bureau, aware of this, has decided to implement tailor shop registration. Currently, all matters are being planned, and registration should begin in the shortest possible time. As for the registration of employment agencies, the bureau has distributed application forms to the sub-bureaus and police stations, instructing them to distribute them to the employment agencies in their respective jurisdictions to fill out. Registration will begin next month. After the application forms have been submitted and reviewed, those that are found to be upstanding will be granted a business license.

When the manufacturer representatives arrived in Singapore, they were warmly welcomed by the local overseas Chinese. On the first day of the opening of the fair, over 50,000 people attended. People from remote areas even came by carriage to attend the grand event. During the fair, it rained occasionally, but the spectacle was not diminished. The goods shipped by each factory were sold out. For example, the goods shipped by our company, worth about six thousand yuan, were all sold out. Upon returning to Shanghai, we received orders totaling over eighty thousand yuan. The patriotism of the overseas Chinese in Nanyang to support domestic goods is unparalleled. Each factory has now appointed an agent in Nanyang to specialize in sales and accept orders.</p>

<h3>Swindler Zhang Xinying Flees in Secret; Court Has Issued an Arrest Warrant</h3>
<p>Zhang Xinying, who used to manage the dancers at a certain dance hall, fraudulently obtained money by falsely claiming to be establishing a Far East Library and distributing promotional letters, and used the money to purchase books for the library. Last month, the police, led by Detective Gao Xian'gen and Detective Ding Huaguo, discovered that Zhang had been swindling for a long time and was a habitual swindler. The Public Works Department filed a lawsuit against Zhang with the First Special District Court. Zhang was summoned to court and released on bail of 1,000 yuan.</p>
<p>It is now learned that the bail for Zhang was provided by Jiu Hua Paper Store at 153 Zhifu Road, owned by Jiang Jicheng; He Feng Paper Store at 165 Zhifu Road, owned by Cui Ziyan; and Yuanli Leather Goods Factory in Changkang Lane, Alabaster Road, owned by Nai Shuqi. However, after being released on bail, Zhang, knowing that he would be held responsible and that the charges were serious, fled with his lover, a former famous prostitute who has now reformed. As a result, the court has repeatedly summoned him for trial, but he has not appeared, and the proceedings could not proceed. The presiding judge, Liu Yuzhu, then ordered the bailors to hand over the defendant. However, the three bailors, Jiang, Cui and Le also pursued Zhang after fleeing, and Yuanli Leather Manufactory has moved to parts unknown. The two paper and cigarette shops have both closed their businesses, and the goods remaining in the two shops have been—Yesterday, Chief Detective Gao and Detective—went to investigate, estimating the value to be less than two hundred gold. This morning, the legal representative of the police department, Zhang Tianyin, reported the above situation to the court and requested a hearing. Judge Liu was very angry and decided to issue an arrest warrant for Zhang Xinying to be brought to justice.</p>
<h3>Shi Jiurong Kidnapping Case: Insufficient Evidence Against Zhang Sanjiuzi</h3>
<p>Shi Jiurong, a Ningbo native and the business department director of the American-owned Meitong Automobile Company at the intersection of Avenue Foch and Rue Massenet, was on his way to the company in a car on the morning of April 18th of this year at 9:00 AM. When the car arrived in front of Meitong Automobile, he was suddenly kidnapped by a gang of bandits, but the kidnapping failed. The bandits scattered and fled, and one was shot dead by detectives on Rue Giraud, but the case remained unsolved. On September 24th of this year, based on a report from Jiangbei native Tian Zonglang to the Chinese police, it was said that his brother, Tian Dazhong, was invited out by Zhang Sanjiuzi on the afternoon of April 14th and had not returned. Later, it was learned that the bandit who was shot dead on April 18th was indeed his brother, Tian Dazhong, who was lured by Zhang to participate in the kidnapping. Consequently, detectives arrested Zhang Sanjiuzi and sent him to the Second Special Court, initiating a public prosecution. After Judge Wang Gangxu opened the court, summoned witnesses, and conducted an investigation, the details of which have been recorded in this newspaper, the case has been repeatedly heard and witnesses have been gathered. The result of the trial was that Zhang vehemently denied participating in the kidnapping. Yesterday morning, the verdict was announced, deeming the evidence insufficient to prove the defendant Zhang Sanjiuzi guilty of the crime of suspicion. The defendant was declared not guilty, but he will remain in custody in the detention center during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Widow Sues Father-in-Law for Support</h3>
<p>Chen Gensheng, a local resident, possessed modest property. His son, Xianzhang, married Ju, and they had two daughters. Unfortunately, Xianzhang fell ill and died in 1933. Chen Gensheng and his wife gradually mistreated their widowed daughter-in-law, Ju, forcing her to work. As a result, she became ill from overwork and was bedridden for several months. Fortunately, Ju's mother was alive and provided occasional relief. However, because she was not tolerated by her parents-in-law, Ju temporarily returned to her mother's home. Later, through the mediation of friends, Chen Gensheng agreed to pay Ju and her two children ten yuan per month for living expenses. Unexpectedly, after only a few months, he stopped the payments, resulting in a significant accumulation of debt. Furthermore, during Xianzhang's illness, medical expenses and business losses led to urgent demands from creditors. Ju borrowed 800 yuan from Mr. Li to repay the debts. However, when the loan came due, she had no money, leading to legal pressure. In this situation, Ju had no choice but to hire lawyer Feng Song to file a lawsuit in the First Court's civil division against her father-in-law, Chen Gensheng, requesting an order for support. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wang Wenkui presided over the hearing in the Seventh Civil Court. The defendant did not appear, and lawyer Zhou Xiaoan appeared to defend him. Lawyer Feng Song, representing the plaintiff, stated that the plaintiff, Chen Ju, is currently 28 years old. She requests support payments from this year until she reaches 60 years of age, at ten yuan per month, as well as the 800 yuan debt, and the assumption of legal costs. Judge Wang reviewed the case and announced that the case would be scheduled for a hearing at a later date.</p>

<h3>Barber Oversteps Boundaries of Decency</h3>
<p>Sun Yongcai, a Funing native, and his wife, Wang, lived together in a straw shed in the Datong Road area of Zhabei. Wang was young and beautiful, which made Yuan Jinyu, a barber, covet her and repeatedly plot to take advantage of her. The day before yesterday evening, Yuan Jinyu devised a plan and secretly instructed Sun's acquaintance, Yu Xiaokouzi, to lure Sun Yongcai out. Meanwhile, Yuan Jinyu sneaked into Wang's bedroom, intending to rape her. Wang resisted to the death and cried for help. Soon, the neighbors gathered, apprehended Yuan Jinyu, and called the police, who arrested him. Yu Xiaokouzi was also taken into custody. Yesterday, they were both sent to the local court for interrogation.</p>
<h3>Teahouse Waiter Rapes Young Girl; Sentence Slightly Reduced After Appeal</h3>
<p>Yang A'ming, also known as Xiao Yang, a 26-year-old teahouse waiter from Changzhou at No. 335 Rue Gallieni in the French Concession, on the morning of the 16th of last month, at around 8:00 AM, forcibly raped Yu Feng, the 14-year-old daughter of Wu Ming, a guest from Liyang in room number seven. He then fled. After the girl's father returned to the hotel and discovered what had happened, he reported it to the Chinese police. Detectives arrested Yang A'ming and sent him to the Second Special Court for public prosecution. At the end of the trial, Yang was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment and ten years of deprivation of civil rights. Yang was not satisfied with the verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the High Court. After a final trial, yesterday afternoon, Acting Judge Sun, along with Judges Wang and Xiong, and Prosecutor Dong, rendered a decision in the Third Criminal Court. The original judgment was revoked. Yang A'ming was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for rape and eight years of deprivation of civil rights. After the judgment, Yang was given a summary explanation of the court's intention, stating that he claimed the girl's mother had abnormal behavior and gave permission for the rape. However, the girl was only fourteen years old. After reviewing the case, the court determined that the rape was indeed committed, but the original sentence was slightly too harsh, so it was reduced to eight years. If he was not satisfied, he could appeal to the Supreme Court after receiving the judgment. During the appeal period, he will remain in custody.</p>
<h3>Elderly Woman Abuses Adopted Daughter-in-Law; Zhou Wu Brutal and Inhumane</h3>
<p>Yang Wangjin, a 16-year-old girl from Yixing, was betrothed this summer through a matchmaker to Zhou Wu, an elderly woman from Suzhou residing at No. 84, 11 Old Guangdong Street, Gaochang Temple, to be her child bride. After entering the family, the woman forced her to do hard labor. If she was not satisfied, she would whip her. The girl suffered this abuse, crying all day long, and her suffering was unbearable. The day before yesterday, the woman used an iron rod to beat the girl, causing her to scream in agony, and her cries reached the outside. This was heard by the nearby patrol officer, who went forward to investigate and discovered that the girl was covered in bruises and scars. The officer took the girl and the elderly woman, Zhou Wu, to the police station in his jurisdiction and sent them to the Ximen Branch Bureau. Director Yao interrogated the woman, who stated that she was sixty years old and that Yujin was her adopted daughter-in-law, who entered the family in June of this year. Because she did not listen to her commands, she scolded her slightly. Her other statements were evasive. Because the woman had abused her adopted daughter-in-law in a cruel and inhumane manner, the situation was particularly egregious. It was ordered that a written report be prepared and sent to the General Bureau for interrogation.</p>

(4) This year, many factories have made considerable profits, and it was proposed that all factories should issue the original year-end double salary to employees. The proposal was approved and passed.</p>

<h3>Minutes of the Meeting of the 25th Branch of the First Special Municipal Union</h3>
<p>The 25th branch of the First Special Municipal Union held a plenary executive committee meeting yesterday, stating that rumors are rampant in the area, creating a state of panic. Large and small households are moving into a single room. This economic downturn is making the market even more deserted. Shops are empty, making it impossible to close down, but it will be impossible to do anything without seeking fundamental solutions. Therefore, it is only possible to request a rent reduction from the owners as a temporary measure to save the situation and revitalize the business community. Next, the meeting discussed the rent reduction requests from over one hundred businesses, including Taishan Tang, Da, Lu Gao, Wan Kang, Wan Tai Guo, and Jin Tai Chang.

<h3>The Popularity of "Kejing," the Sacred Medicine for Tuberculosis</h3>
<p>Tuberculosis is often regarded as an incurable disease by the world. Since the launch of "Kejing," a special medicine for tuberculosis, this notion has been disproven. However, due to the prevalence of inferior medicines on the market, using counterfeit products to deceive, those who mistakenly take them not only fail to reduce their illness but may even increase other diseases, creating a situation where people are afraid of even mentioning the disease. It is reported that the general manager of the medicine, Baixin Bank at No. 33 Sichuan Road in this port, in order to prove the effectiveness of "Kejing" in treating tuberculosis, has specially contracted with advanced hospitals since last month to use X-ray fluoroscopy and photography to confirm the true efficacy of the medicine. Since the implementation of this method, the public has more deeply understood the actual medicinal power of the medicine. It is reported that the medicine has the effect of curing all lung diseases such as cough, asthma, pneumonia, hemoptysis, and night sweats. Major companies and pharmacies in this and other ports all sell it. If you wish to request a free X-ray consultation method, please send a letter to the bank, and it will be sent to you immediately.</p>

<h3>Letters</h3>
<p>To the Editor-in-Chief of Shenbao,</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>I recently read a notice in today's news section of your newspaper, stating that our association has decided to close all branches managed by Chinese personnel from July 1, 1936. Our association's Shanghai head office and branch offices in various locations are operating as usual and have not changed. All branch offices in the interior were closed on July 1 of this year. Therefore, July 1, 1936, as reported in your newspaper, is actually a mistake for July 1, 1935. I am writing to you specifically to request that you check and correct it.</p>
<p>Yours sincerely,</p>
<p>Head Office of the International Savings Society</p>
<p>November 28</p>
<p>Dear Sir,</p>
<p>Regarding the matter of our shop being defrauded of cloth by a swindler on the 25th of this month, the details have been published in your newspaper, but there are slight inaccuracies. Our shop's name is Yin Yuanshun, and it was mistakenly written as "Yin Shunyuan." The swindler's name is Zai Weiqing. After taking the cloth on that day, Song Bangyi arrived at our shop within five minutes to make trouble over plain cloth, but your newspaper mistakenly wrote that he came to demand cloth "a few days" before. Because the matter is of great importance to the lawsuit, I am writing to inform you specifically and request that you correct it immediately to avoid giving the villains an excuse.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Yin Yuanshun Shop</p>

<h3>A Visit to the China Wool Spinning Factory</h3>
<p>— Wu Yuxuan</p>
<p>The manufacture of woolen yarn is one of the departments of the wool textile industry. Therefore, the manufacture of woolen yarn has not yet received attention. As a result, the various woolen yarns used daily are almost entirely supplied by foreign goods in industrialized countries such as Europe, America, and Japan. According to customs records, the average annual import amount has been more than six million gold units in the past three years, which has invisibly become a major loophole in my country's national economy. In recent years, the voice of saving the country through industry has risen, and people with lofty ideals have begun to set up their own factories to imitate foreign goods to remedy this loss. The first domestic manufacturers engaged in this business were the Dongya Xianghe two factories in Tianjin, and the Zhenxing, Zhanghua, and San factories in Shanghai. However, these factories mostly operate woolen yarn manufacturing as a sideline to their main production business. In addition, the British Jardine Matheson Spinning Mill and the Japanese Shanghai Spinning Mill also operate this business as a side business. Since last autumn, the Shanghai Wool Textile Factory, Yumin Textile Company, and China Wool Textile Factory have been established one after another. At the same time, the British Baldwin Knitting Yarn Factory, which was once famous in the Chinese market for its Bee Brand woolen yarn, also set up a factory in China this spring to avoid high taxes from the Chinese government and facilitate competition. As a result, the woolen yarn manufacturing industry has become one of my country's emerging industries. To understand the content of this emerging industry, the reporter visited the recently established China Wool Spinning Factory on November 21 with the industrial and commercial visiting group of this newspaper.</p>
<p>The China Wool and Velvet Textile Factory is located on Linqing Road in Yangshupu. The person in charge is Mr. Chen Wuqin, the manager of the factory. When the reporter and others arrived at the factory, Mr. Chen and Associate Manager Bi Zhongying warmly welcomed them. First, they introduced the establishment of the factory. According to them, the preparation for visiting the factory, which has been developing vigorously for nearly forty years, is to introduce the establishment of the factory. However, my country's hundred industries are backward. To this day, people can only sigh that the textile industry can compete with foreign goods. In June of last year, the person in charge once went to Japan to inspect the woolen yarn manufacturing business to learn from it. However, most of Japan's industries are kept secret, so the results of the first inspection only revealed that Japan's woolen yarn textile industry uses French machines and the general situation of Australian wool. It was not until the second inspection that they could slightly know the inside story. After returning to China, they immediately raised a capital of 250,000 yuan, ordered machines from the French Desheng Foreign Company, hired French technicians, and at the same time selected a site and rented a house. By September of this year, the machines were finally installed, and the factory was officially put into production. From June of last year to September of this year, the preparation period lasted for more than a year, and the machine installation took about four months. The factory's capital has actually expanded to hundreds of thousands of yuan.</p>
<p>After Mr. Chen and Mr. Bi briefly described the establishment of the factory, they immediately led the reporter and others to inspect the factory for a week. The factory's building is divided into three parts. The first part is the woolen yarn weaving workshop, which has eight drawing machines, five spindle machines, one carding machine, and one joining machine. The work of the eight drawing machines is collectively called the front section. The first, second, and third drawing machines each have four functions at the same time: (1) lengthening, (2) thinning, (3) removing dirt, and (4) combing evenly. After the raw material wool tops (semi-finished products of raw wool) pass through the first, second, and third drawing machines, they gradually become thin, long, even, and clean yarns. In addition to having the same functions as the above three drawing machines, the fourth drawing machine also has a softening function. This machine is the latest invention. Most of the wool spinning factories that have been established for a long time do not have this equipment. Its selling price is about 19,000 yuan in national currency per machine. The fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth drawing machines only have two functions: lengthening and softening. Because the dirt removal and uniform scooping of the yarns after passing through the first four drawing machines have been completed, the work of the last four drawing machines is determined by the thickness of the required yarn and the number of drawing machines it should pass through. After the drawing work is completed, the manufacturing process immediately turns to the back spinning section. The back spinning includes the work of three machines: spindle machines, joining machines, and carding machines. First, the yarns that have passed through the spinning work are sent to the spindle machine to make them into yarn bobbins. Then, the yarns on the bobbins are passed through the joining machine to become twisted woolen yarns. Finally, they are passed through the carding machine to become bundled woolen yarns.

<h3>Ministry of Education Supervisor Zhong's Inspection: Zhejiang Provincial Vocational Education Report (3)</h3>
<p>9.  Private Wu Ling Elementary Vocational School: This school was established with donations from Mr. Chiang Kai-shek. It has four elementary classes with ninety students. Fourth-year students focus on practical work, and are assigned to various agricultural organizations for apprenticeships, divided into four groups: Agricultural Economics, Agricultural Technology, Rural Education, and Agricultural Extension. The intention is commendable. It has over two hundred acres of farmland, not including the forest area. It is divided into four sections: crop cultivation, horticulture, animal husbandry, and extension. It has achieved some success in selecting seeds and raising livestock. Teaching emphasizes self-study, encouraging students to read carefully instead of relying solely on lectures. Assessments are also rigorous.</p>
<p>Due to many teachers returning to their hometowns during the vacation, the school cannot implement vacation assignments. The school should provide dormitories for teachers' families to prevent all teachers from leaving the school, leaving the farm without responsible guidance. The school buildings are very beautiful, but may not be suitable for the living conditions of agricultural students to cultivate adaptability to the environment. To ensure the school's facilities are complete, a girls' vocational class should be added, focusing on education in home economics and rural household handicrafts. The affiliated elementary school has both male and female students, but the elementary agricultural department only admits boys, depriving girls of educational opportunities, which is a great pity.</p>
<p>10. Provincial Jin Tang Normal School Elementary Agricultural Science Department: This department has two elementary classes with forty-two students. Recently, due to the small number of applicants and the susceptibility to the influence of the normal school atmosphere in agricultural training, many graduates have also engaged in education. Therefore, enrollment has been temporarily suspended. It has one hundred and twenty acres of farmland and over thirty acres of orchards. Apart from designating certain areas of land as public practice fields for experimentation, the remaining seventy to eighty acres are leased to each student at one to two acres per student for self-cultivation, planting, and harvesting. The school is only responsible for guidance. All profits are used to subsidize student expenses, which is a very good method. Crop yields are satisfactory. The summer vacation internship lasts three weeks, with meals provided by the school. All equipment, except for modern agricultural tools, is barely adequate. However, due to teachers occupying too many rooms, the physics and chemistry lab, library, and farm tool room are all cluttered and crowded. The department could try providing one year of normal school training to elementary agricultural graduates, or emphasizing both normal school and agricultural studies, and simultaneously establishing farmer's supplementary classes, focusing on cotton seed improvement, without suspending enrollment.</p>
<p>11. Private Ming De Nursery Elementary Normal School with Affiliated Home Economics Vocational Department: The school has three departments: a four-year elementary normal school, a three-year ordinary home economics department, and a three-year women's ordinary supplementary department, with a total of eighty students. For the first three years, the home economics and normal school departments attend classes together. Those who wish to become teachers are instructed to study education and teaching practice for one year. The supplementary department aims to complete the entire elementary school curriculum. It should be converted into a vocational supplementary school, providing home economics training to older, unschooled women to lay the foundation for improving family life.</p>
<p>The school has an affiliated elementary school, kindergarten, and nursery, paying close attention to the diet and nutrition of children and infants. Some students even bring their children to study at the school, educating the children while studying themselves. Those from slightly poorer families also take care of children for others, earning seventy to eighty yuan per year to subsidize their expenses, which is a very good approach. The main goal of students coming to the school is to acquire knowledge and skills in managing a household, which aligns well with the original purpose of home economics education. Therefore, among the students are mothers and young women, making it a rare school in the country. The students range in age from sixteen or seventeen to thirty or forty, with an average age of twenty-eight. The teaching and equipment for ordinary subjects urgently need improvement, but the implementation of specialized subjects is quite good. The equipment is not yet fully complete, and there are only two specialized teachers, which should also be supplemented to ensure completeness.</p>
<p>12. Private Continental Senior Surveying Vocational School: The school is divided into three classes: surveying and control surveying, with approximately eighty students. The control surveying training class admits students who have completed the second year of junior high school and graduates in one year. Although the career prospects are good, their academic ability is too poor to be useful. They should be given opportunities for further study, and in the future, junior high school graduates should be admitted and given one and a half years of training.</p>
<p>The subjects in the senior surveying department are appropriately allocated. Specialized subjects have a teaching schedule. Most of the teachers are part-time personnel from the surveying bureau, and the teaching is considered effective. The practical training time is also sufficient. Basic exercises are conducted in the first year, concentrated practical training for six weeks each semester in the second year, and two months of practical training in the third year. The methods are quite good, and surveying instruments are also sufficient. Students' career prospects do not seem to be a problem.</p>
<p>13. Private Hangzhou Women's Elementary Home Economics Commercial Vocational School: The school has three elementary sewing classes, four elementary commercial classes, two ordinary supplementary classes, and one apprentice class, with a total of approximately three hundred students. Among them, the commercial department is more developed. The commercial department focuses on Chinese, English, and mathematics, all exceeding the prescribed hours. Practical training is a maximum of four hours per week per person (half in banks and half in stores). Typewriters are insufficient for practice, and there are no Chinese typewriters. Research on commodities and surveys of market conditions are both lacking. Graduates still have credibility in the financial sector. In recent years, career prospects have gradually become difficult. Of the forty recent graduates, twenty-two wish to work, while the rest plan to pursue further education or are sent to banks outside the school for practical training, which should be scheduled before graduation and considered as part of the practical training. The school's internal store has overly simple equipment and provides little benefit. After graduating from the sewing department, many serve the country, but the situation is not clear. Their work performance is quite good, but cutting skills still need more attention. The school's name includes "home economics," but the class hours for home economics subjects are very few, which should be addressed. If a separate department cannot be established, it can be attached to the sewing department. Teaching should emphasize imparting knowledge of household hygiene, parenting, and household economics. The commercial department can also pay attention to this. The ordinary supplementary class should be transformed into a supplementary class with vocational implications, providing sufficient training in life skills and housekeeping knowledge to older, unschooled women, with classes held in the afternoon and evening. The continuation of this type of education should not be judged based on the number of students, as a new facility cannot initially outperform others. The apprentice class focuses on work and has very few classes, being entirely business-oriented. Subjects should be appropriately added to align with the purpose of vocational supplementary education. Principal Ms. Xie Xue maintains the school affairs with painstaking effort. Recently, due to old age and declining strength, there is a lack of successors. She has repeatedly requested the Education Department to take over. The Education Department should consider this. If it can be taken over by the province and expanded, it would greatly benefit women's vocational education in Zhejiang.</p>
<p>14. Provincial Financial Personnel Training Institute: This school was originally private but recently became provincial. It currently has four classes with one hundred and sixty students, graduating in three years. All courses focus on accounting, statistics, and bookkeeping, which are very similar to senior commercial studies. It should be renamed Senior Commercial or Senior Financial Vocational School to comply with regulations. It once tried a one-year program, assigning graduates to serve in various counties, but the results were poor. Later, it recruited elementary school students to graduate in three years, but the results were also unsatisfactory. Judging from the service status of graduates, most can use what they have learned. However, all training and effectiveness are similar to the provincial senior high school commercial department. The two schools should find a way to merge to avoid duplication. First-year students have no practical training, second-year students have internal practical training, and third-year students are introduced to various financial collection agencies for apprenticeships in the second semester, which is a very good approach. Teaching management is also practical and strict.</p>
<h3>Interpretation of Foreigners Establishing Supplementary Schools in China</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 28th dispatch) The Ministry of Education, based on a request from the Ping Municipality Social Bureau for an interpretation of the doubts regarding foreigners establishing public supplementary schools in China, has specifically instructed the bureau, stating that if the nature of the school involves imparting skills or lecturing on academics, targeting those who have already received education, and providing higher knowledge or skills training, it is permissible to establish such schools under guidance and supervision. However, if the purpose is to provide supplementary education for unschooled citizens or illiterate individuals, foreigners are not allowed to operate such schools.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (1)(0)(9)</h3>
<p>—Original by Louisa M. Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>At that moment, Mr. Rice, who was driving past in a cart loaded with hay, heard Mrs. Jo calling him and turned around. She wanted him to take the whole class to the meadow and pick them up at five o'clock.</p>
<p>"This will inevitably delay some of your work, but it doesn't matter: we're willing to reward you with blackberry pie," Mrs. Jo said, knowing Mr. Rice's weakness.</p>
<p>His rough, dark, and yellow face immediately lit up, and he laughed happily, "Ha! Ha! Oh, Mrs. Pei, if you first allow me this delicious thing, I will immediately obey."</p>
<p>Mrs. Pei was then greatly relieved and walked back into the room, saying to everyone, "Children, I have already arranged everything. You can all go." She loved to make them happy, and she felt very distressed when she occasionally disturbed the quiet life of her youngest son; because she believed that adults should give sympathetic respect to children's small hopes, plans, and pleasures, and should not rudely stop or ridicule them.</p>
<p>Upon hearing this, Don was overjoyed and asked, "Can I go?"</p>
<p>"I especially thought of you, be careful, and don't bother with the strawberries, just sit and be glad that you can often find your beloved things around you and quietly observe and enjoy them," Mrs. Pei replied, clearly remembering his kindness to her child just now.</p>
<p>"I'm going too! I'm going too!" Rob was extremely happy, dancing and singing, hitting the lid of the tin bucket, making a sound like cymbals.</p>

It was predicted that Indian silver would shrink by one anna. At noon, the trend was stable. The afternoon market also opened stable. Nikko dumped foreign exchange, causing the market to gradually decline. Although Indian silver fell by a small anna, it had little impact.

<h3>Securities Securities Transaction Over 65 Million Yuan Bond Discounts at 92 Highest, 75 Lowest</h3>
<p>Transaction Volume Yesterday, November 28th, was the settlement date for the November futures of the Chinese Securities Exchange. The market was closed the day before (November 27th) to prepare for the settlement. This settlement, excluding over-the-counter transactions, amounted to more than 65,495,000 yuan. In terms of settlement volume, aside from the 96 bonds, which had the most at approximately 9 million, the 22 Customs bonds surprisingly ranked second with over 7.1 million, and the Disarmament bonds also had 6.91 million. On the delivery side, aside from general arbitrageurs accounting for half, the majority was due to retail investors releasing bonds and being unable to recover them for delivery. On the receiving side, the majority was arbitrage by the financial sector, with the remainder being general giants, as they were easier to mortgage to banks.</p>
<p>Market Price History The lowest point was on October 17th, when salt tax was only 43.85 yuan, Disarmament bonds were 62.3 yuan, Finance Short-term bonds were 64.5 yuan, and Sixth-Year bonds were 59.5 yuan. At that time, the Italo-Ethiopian conflict, the potential involvement of Britain, the Japanese Dalian Conference, and the Shantou Japanese military incident all impacted market prices, leading to a crowded short position. However, starting that afternoon, the financial sector began to raise prices. At the time, there were rumors in the market that spot goods were extremely scarce. Upon investigation, it was found that the financial sector was still engaged in arbitrage and not actual receipt of goods. If this is true, future turbulent waves are yet to come. The rumors of currency reform, after a long period of circulation, suddenly materialized on November 4th. Neither the assassination of former President Wang, nor the Japanese naval incident on Searle Road, nor the recent North China Incident seemed to shake the confidence of the bulls. Market prices rose in a straight line, reaching new highs from November 21st to 24th. Salt tax reached 57.5 yuan, Disarmament bonds reached 85.5 yuan, Financial bonds reached 80.08 yuan, and Sixth-Year bonds reached 78.8 yuan, creating new highs unseen in recent years. Bullish investors advanced aggressively, extremely recklessly. Recently, Yin Rugeng's unusual actions have involved foreign affairs and are gradually expanding. The future turmoil is difficult to predict. The futures settlement and total transaction volume for November are listed below (unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>Progress in French Politics New York Stock Market Recovers</h3>
<p>According to a report from New Fook Tai &amp; Co., the New York stock market advanced yesterday (November 27th). Because there was no market the following day, trading was quite light.

Stocks on the smaller exchange were quietly firm. The total daily transaction volume was 1.86 million shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Yarn Market Suffers Another Setback Market Turns Upward Before Close Results Still Down More Than Two Yuan</h3>
<p>The yarn market continued to decline. Initially, due to the detention of vehicles by the Japanese army in Tianjin yesterday morning, market sentiment was shaken, and selling was extremely intense. Most bullish investors, aware of the deteriorating environment, closed their positions, and the selling pressure caused prices to fall. In the afternoon, news that the Japanese army had withdrawn from Fengtai became known, and market sentiment immediately became active and turned upward. However, the final result was still a fall of 1.1 to 2.4 yuan. However, it is said that the bullish positions of banks and non-industry players remained unchanged.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Steps Down</p>
<p>Before the auction of marked yarn, the opening prices for each month were consistently low. Due to tense news about the situation in North China, people were worried, and selling became more intense. The market price decreased step by step, and sellers exerted pressure, causing the situation to worsen. However, non-industry players and the financial sector's large positions remained unchanged. As a result, each month fell by 1.7 to 2 yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. In the afternoon, the situation was extremely weak, and the market situation was severe, causing the February price to break through the 200 yuan mark. Each month fell by 1.3 to 4 yuan. The second and third rounds gradually recovered, and the market improved even more at the closing. It was said that the news of the withdrawal of the Japanese army from the Fengtai station spread, and buying began, causing the market to rise again. As a result, each month fell by 1 to 4 jiao compared to the closing price of the morning. It was found that 1,650 bales of Dafeng, 1,100 bales of Jinchang, 550 bales of Minghua, 750 bales of Gengfeng, 650 bales of Senkang, 600 bales of Tongfeng, 1,100 bales of Yuan Yi, 2,250 bales of Runkang, and 750 bales of Tonghe were sold. 500 bales of Tongfu, 950 bales of Yuanda, 600 bales of Zhenda, 2,000 bales of Taichang, 1,250 bales of Yichang, 900 bales of Tonghe, 1,850 bales of Gengfeng, 1,000 bales of Dachangcheng, and 950 bales of Daji were purchased.

<h3>Cotton Falls First, Then Recovers American Ann Buys Up Chinese Cotton, Industry Players Switch from Bullish to Bearish</h3>
<p>The cotton market initially fell, then recovered. American cotton still saw mixed gains and losses. Most industry players who had made profits in the local market have already switched from bullish to bearish. Any bad news would cause pressure to worsen. However, the American and Ann Foreign Firm, considering that the calculated price of American and Indian cotton was more than 10 yuan per dan jin higher than the price of equivalent Chinese cotton, continued to buy up Chinese cotton. As for the Japanese merchants, they closed out a considerable amount of positions, but their overall position was still bullish.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Ningbo Gang Sells Off</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton market, prices for each month fell sharply, and the situation became more alarming. Due to the sudden seriousness of the situation in North China, selling increased sharply, and short sellers put on pressure, causing market prices to fall step by step. However, the American and Ann Foreign Firm absorbed a large amount at low prices, and the Ningbo Gang sold off a lot. As a result, each month fell by 7.5 to 8 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The far-month price broke through the 3 yuan mark. In the afternoon, the market situation was weak, and selling pressure was strong. Each month continued to fall by 3.5 jiao. However, after the second and third rounds of trading, foreign firms continued to buy in. At the same time, news from the north improved, and the yarn market recovered, causing market prices to turn upward from weakness. As a result, each month rose by 1 to 1.5 jiao compared to the closing price of the morning. It was found that 2,200 dan of Yuda, 1,500 dan of Yiyu, 2,500 dan of Dafu, 2,100 dan of Dafeng, 2,100 dan of Minghua, 3,100 dan of Gengfeng, 2,700 dan of Yuan Yi, 7,400 dan of Changfeng, 2,700 dan of Xiacheng, 5,700 dan of Tonghe, 5,300 dan of Yuanxingchang, 1,300 dan of Ruiyuan, and 2,500 dan of Hexing were sold. 2,400 dan of Gengfeng, 3,300 dan of Daji, 2,300 dan of Dafeng, 4,800 dan of Meiji, 2,100 dan of Yuanda, 4,300 dan of Hexing, 2,800 dan of Dachangcheng, 5,000 dan of Yichang, 3,500 dan of Runkang, 3,700 dan of Yikang, 2,300 dan of Tongji, 4,100 dan of Xincheng, and 1,200 dan of Yongda were purchased.

<p>American Cotton Firm in the Near Term, Weak in the Far Term</p>
<p>British and Indian Cotton also Show Little Progress</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened steadily, but because it was before the holiday, trading was very quiet. Prices initially rose due to purchases by industry players and foreign firms, but later softened due to hedging sales and profit-taking by bullish investors. Ordinary demand was sluggish due to waiting for the development of the French political situation and the upcoming release of the next year's cotton industry plan on Monday. Hedging volume in the South was not large, and factory demand was relatively quiet. The footing of low-grade cotton was slightly soft. Later, short covering and industry purchases of near-term contracts caused the market to firm again. As a result, spot prices remained unchanged, near-term prices rose by 1 to 6 points, and far-month prices fell by 1 to 2 points. British cotton spot prices fell by 2 points, and futures fell by 4 to 7 points. Indian cotton European exporters sold slightly, and trading was sparse. Bengal rose by 0.5 to 1.75 rupees, Oomra rose by 0.5 rupees, and White Broach fell by 0.25 rupees. The original telegraph is on the left (November 27th telegram):</p>

<h3>Recent Foreign Cotton Import Statistics</h3>
<p>According to recent foreign cotton imports into this city, there were 1,100 bales of American cotton, 1,400 bales of Indian cotton, and 545 bales of Egyptian cotton. There were no imports of Burmese cotton, South American cotton, or African cotton.</p>
<h3>Grains High Prices Cause Buyers to Be Cautious Futures Flour and Wheat Remain Calm</h3>
<p>The flour market showed a state of falling first and then stabilizing. At the initial opening, because the price of foreign wheat fluctuated by one jiao, market sentiment paid little attention. As the situation in North China entered a serious state, spot sales there seemed to have completely stopped. Although the inventory of factories was not abundant, because spot sales were quiet, each factory had a small amount of inventory. Therefore, market sentiment turned soft, and transactions also decreased. However, after the second round of trading, non-industry players came to absorb again, and near-term contracts recovered slightly, while far-term contracts recovered by about two fen. At the opening of the afternoon session, it was initially stable, but because rumors about the situation in North China became more prevalent, buyers became even more silent, and transactions were only around 200,000. Because the settlement for this month is approaching, the near-term is slightly more than two fen, and the far-term is slightly one fen. Looking at the subsequent situation, if spot sales are not smooth, the upward trend will be less than expected.</p>

<p>April 3.1400 3.2325 Down 0.0075</p>
<p>At the opening of the wheat market in the morning, transactions for each month remained sluggish. Both buyers and sellers showed little interest. Market prices for each month were slightly lower than the closing price of the previous day, by two to three fen. At the opening of the afternoon session, transactions were still quiet. December and January both broke through the floor price, while the remaining months were in a state of mutual rejection, with little vitality. From the perspective of inventory, most people are optimistic, but because market prices have reached a peak, buyers are also cautious, and transactions are quieter, which is not without reason. Spot wheat showed slight weakness due to the consistent decline in futures flour and wheat. Kaishaheji Bengbu wheat was 5.06 yuan, Qianjiao wheat was 5.04 yuan, Pinghu wheat was 4.88 yuan, Tiantai wheat was 4.91 yuan, and Hankou wheat was 4.78 yuan. Xinda sold 2,500 bags, and Fuxin sold 1,000 bags.</p>

<h3>Foreign Firms Resume Trading in Sesame and Rapeseed</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sesame and rapeseed market saw a decline, with 500 tons traded throughout the day at a price of 11.5 yuan. This caused the price of spot raw sesame to fall by 5 fen to 1.67 jiao, and the number of transactions also increased. A total of more than 3,000 bags of various sesame seeds were traded. From the perspective of sales, the market has become more active again. Rapeseed trading opened with 1,000 bags of Changshu goods at a price of 9.05 yuan, and the market situation was relatively stable. Soybean sales were sluggish, and factories were watching, so vehicle beans were not opened, and the market was calm. For other beans, firms in Nanyang continued to trade, with more than 2,000 bags of various beans traded, and prices fluctuated.</p>
<h3>Hexia Rice Market Weak in the South, Firm in the North</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various gangs still reached more than 40, with approximately 8,000 shi of goods arriving. The drizzling rain and depressed sentiment continued, so the sales in this street were sluggish, and the market situation was mediocre. The price of high-grade early-season japonica rice, due to limited arrivals, remained stable, while mid-grade rice depreciated by 1 to 2 jiao. Although various thin rice shipments from Qingdao, Yantai, and other gangs continued to move 4,000+ bags, it was difficult to raise the market. The result was still a high-stable, mid-weak situation, with mid-grade goods down a small amount.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from Hexia reached 32 or 33. Due to the rain, there was not much stock at shops. Sales were sluggish. The price of high-grade japonica rice was stable to tight, and the digestion of early rice was slightly better due to less stock. Yangbu tips also followed suit, and the price of thin rice remained unchanged at 6 to 7 fen. The prices of other goods were stable.</p>
<h3>Customer's Rice Transactions Suddenly Become Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, foreign rice did not make a transaction, because warehouses kept prices high, and importers did not chase the price. On the other hand, the amount of customers' rice shipments continues and are nonstop. The purchasing in this street was also still. The north gang had the reason that the situation in North China was unstable, so they did not teach continuous transporting, and the warehouse viewing didn't advance, the street price was short by 3 to 4 fen. The whole day was opened with 650 bags of Gan rice, 500+ bags of Liangshao rice, 500 bags of Wental rice, and 130 bags of Anqing. All of those were purchased by the street.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Last Month's Tung Oil Sales Decreased For Months, Foreign Sales Were Extraordinarily Smooth, Inventory Was Exhausted, Sales Were Sparse</h3>
<p>According to a report from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, the domestic and foreign sales of tung oil in this city in October were both less than in September. The amount of foreign sales that passed inspection decreased by 1,803.36 metric tons compared to the previous month, while domestic sales decreased by 107.5 metric tons compared to the previous month. It is believed that this reduction is not a sign of market weakness. In recent months, foreign sales of tung oil have been extraordinarily smooth, and the inventory has been exhausted, resulting in an inevitable trend of insufficient supply. The following is an excerpt of the figures for exports and domestic sales of tung oil that passed inspection in September and October for reference (unit: metric tons):</p>
<p>Exports to October September Domestic Sales October September</p>

<h3>Sugar Market Coarse Sand White Also Falls by Five Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was weak due to sluggish spot sales. The guild's assessed price for spot No. 24 coarse sand white was 21.8 yuan, down 5 fen from the previous day, with slight transactions. Transshipment goods were quoted at 6.9 yuan but did not succeed. Zhenji No. 1 local refined white was 20.9 yuan, unchanged. Nos. 2, 3, 4, and 5 were quoted as usual, and the Chao gang continued to open new Chaoqing for more than 100 bags, at 10 yuan. Jiandu also opened more than 50 bags of Yuanqing, at 8.8 yuan, with little fluctuation. Dongchi was quoted at 17.2 to 17 yuan. No. 8 white spot and transshipment goods were quoted at the original price. No. 9 white SH mark spot and transshipment goods were down 5 fen, with no transactions.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods Whole Batch of Quanzhou Longans Expected Today</h3>
<p>There have been no arrivals of Quanzhou longans for more than three weeks. Yesterday, the firm heard that a whole batch had been shipped out and is expected to arrive today.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods Yuanfang Yu Silk Had The Most Transactions</h3>
<p>Yesterday was Thursday and the 2,968th of the Yuanfang Foreign Firm. It was announced that 180 pieces of Taisi Satin, 40 pieces of Yuan Velvet, 20 pieces of Yuan Zhaigong wool, 1,370 pieces of Yuan Yu Silk, 30 pieces of Foreign Factory Cloth, and 60 pieces of Foreign Blue Cloth were to be auctioned. Customer trade was active, the price of Taisi Satin had up and down, the price of Yuan velvet was slightly up, and the price of Yuan Yu Silk, Luangfeng Renqiu, Sandingjia, Kuailei, and Baziwu were down. The rest all saw an increase in price. The price of red and blue foreign cloth has improved slightly compared to the previous period.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Luzhuang Zhenmei Has Some Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, there were no transactions in Zhenmei, Zhucha, Gongxi, and other green teas. However, as a result of Hua tea merchants repeatedly reducing prices for Zhenmei green tea from Luzhuang such as Wuyuan Tunxi, Morocco slightly required to purchase. The whole city was purchased by foreign firms such as Jardine, Baochang, and Fushi, with 270 boxes. The sales price of core-pulling goods was reduced to 84 yuan, and the wholesale price was reduced to 51 yuan. The losses of merchants have increased even more than before.</p>

<h3>Stone Carving</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jing</p>
<p>I don’t know what kind of fate it is, but the children are enthusiastically carving stone seals.</p>
<p>Children have a very strong interest in new things. This interest is further heightened when they live a group life. If it is something they can't get, they will definitely find a way to get it. If it is something they can't do, they must try it. Even if you repeatedly warn them that it is a stupid or arrogant act.</p>
<p>Carving seals, when they can't even write characters properly, they naturally won't be able to do well. However, they insist on carving, and carve with great enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Ever since I wrote characters on a stone for one child, all the children who are carving seals know about it. They, who can't write characters, know that someone can write characters, and their joy is imaginable. So, sounds like "Teacher! Write for me" combined into a huge noise.</p>
<p>This trend was initially prevalent among older children. Because the difficulty of writing characters was removed, even younger children followed suit and started carving.</p>
<p>Writing characters is always my job. I seem to have become a responsive idol in a temple. As soon as class is over, they, regardless of whether you want to rest or not, rush to extend the stones (mostly unpolished stones) and shout eagerly, "Write for me! Teacher!" Some even don't have time to say the word "Teacher."</p>
<p>During the time from lunch to class, everyone is free. The children who want to write characters surround you in groups. The school originally has a disciplinary team to maintain order, but when they see them so crowded and shouting, they want to exercise their disciplinary authority. However, it is useless. The unanimous answer is almost entirely "I'm not asking you to write" and other similar words.</p>
<p>Once the characters are written, they run away one by one in a hurry, without stopping for a moment, pick up a knife and carve. Whether it is Chinese class or arithmetic class, this classroom or that classroom, there are always those children who are not afraid of the teacher's scolding, burying their heads in carving their seals.</p>
<p>They carved so frantically for three or four days, and I was surrounded by their frenzy for three or four days. In these few days, with the hands of one hundred and several dozen children, and five or six hundred stones (each person averaging at least four), sawing and grinding, the walls in the lane and the table tops in the classroom were covered with snow-white stone powder. — Until now, the ones in the classroom have long been wiped away, but the ones on the walls are still left as a memorial to their grand and enthusiastic activity.</p>
<p>Just when this activity was at its climax, the children's misfortune came! All their stones were confiscated by the teacher at each desk. It goes without saying that there were complaints everywhere. However, the teachers who confiscated also had their reasons: they soiled the walls and the table tops, which was unsightly; and what's more, they were carving even during class, which was a waste of their studies and could not be tolerated.</p>
<p>After this blow, the children were greatly disappointed. But still some children secretly come to ask me to write, and secretly carve.</p>
<p>Now, I myself no longer have this kind of crazy love for things, but I feel great joy for the children's activity this time. I keep thinking that if there are wise teachers who can grasp this precious interest of the children, take the opportunity to guide them, and make them abandon this carving of seals with a "private possession" nature, and turn to the carving of real things, it will definitely have good results. Perhaps among these children, one or two Rodin-like figures can be nurtured, which is not impossible. Even if not, even second-rate, or even worse, would be fine.</p>
<p>Every time I see the traces of stone powder on the wall, I always feel that my thoughts will definitely get true proof, and I am very disappointed!</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous Notes on the Tokyo Film Industry</h3>
<p>— Fang Xun</p>
<p>At the beginning of autumn, the real movie season has not yet begun, but the "Famous Films Week" held in a small cinema at that time fully aroused my desire to see it. However, firstly, because the doctor did not allow me to go to crowded places, and secondly, because the screening time conflicted with the hospital's schedule, but, during this week, I finally went twice without the doctor's knowledge. The rule of Japanese cinemas is to select two feature films for each screening, so what I saw were the German film "Dreaming Lips" (Der Traumende Mund) and the French film "Foreign Legion" (Le Grand Jen), which I probably will never have hope of seeing in China, and the American film "Cynan.a" directed by King Jidor and "Street Scenca." In "Dreaming Lips," what I wanted to see was just Elizabeth Bergner's acting skills. In "Foreign Legion," I wanted to see Jack Fede's direction. "Cynan.a" had been seen in the Lyceum in Shanghai, and seeing it again was just for Marion Irances's script, while "Street Scenca" was a film that I had missed in Shanghai due to circumstances and had been eagerly awaiting for two years without a re-release. Sure enough, this is a masterpiece unique to American films. After watching this film, I went back to find the script written by Emer Rriee. If I have the opportunity, I might want to translate this script and the film script. Among the so-called literary films I have seen, this film can be regarded as the most successful and unique. The "Famous Films Week" was held in a very small theater with only about four hundred seats. Of course, there were no air conditioning or ventilation facilities, and the seat prices were particularly fair, with each ticket costing two dimes and buying one getting one free, so the result was that it cost two jiao of Chinese money, a total of four excellent films to watch. Perhaps because it was a "Famous Film," the audience was all intellectuals, and most of them had an interest in film beyond that of a layman, so there was absolutely no talking during the screening, and some people even took notebooks to secretly record the scenes that they found interesting.</p>
<p>In terms of the system, Japanese cinemas are indeed very different from Chinese cinemas. In addition to the above-mentioned fact that each program screens two or even three feature films, most of them are continuous screening systems. As long as you are not afraid of a headache, you can sit inside for nine or ten hours with one ticket price. When they screen, except for the screenings at nine or ten in the morning on Sundays, most of them screen at noon every day and end at ten thirty in the afternoon. If you don't want to watch two films, then you can go after eight o'clock in the afternoon to buy a "discount" ticket, so when the gentlemen and ladies of Shanghai are having Dinner at Eight and leisurely going to the cinema at around 9:15, the ticket sellers and ushers in Tokyo cinemas have already patted the powder on their faces, changed their clothes, and gone to stroll on the Ginza streets with their matched friends. Thirdly, is the theater equipment. In terms of capacity, Tokyo has very large-scale places, such as the Japan Theater with 2,958 seats and the Hibiya Theater with 1,700 seats, etc., but their business slogan is only precise film selection and attentive service. Apart from these two, all unnecessary expenses are extremely frugal. Even the Japan Theater, which the Japanese boast as "the best in the Orient," has to let the Grand Theater and Cathay in Shanghai take a step in terms of splendor and fashion. Furthermore, the first-class "Imperial Theater" in Shinjuku is not even as good as the Lido and Guanglu, which screen second-run films in China. From these places, it can be seen that Chinese people, not to mention other things, are fully entitled to say that they have already stood at the very top of the world in terms of fashion and love of comfort.</p>
<p>With one or two exceptions, American films screened in Japan are usually more than half a year behind Shanghai. The reason for this may be for the purpose of making Japanese versions (that is, adding Japanese subtitles on the screen) — recently, they have gone a step further. In addition to making Japanese versions, they have also made "Japanese language versions," that is, removing the original sound and re-dubbing with Japanese narration. This time, P.C.L.'s trial product, Locke's Feet ficel, was a great success. Although there were many places that were "not synchronous," the cleverly translated dialogues fully compensated for these shortcomings. In the future, perhaps an era similar to the Japanese language will appear. — But there is one good thing about Japan, that is, you can see a wealth of European (excluding Soviet Russia) works. However, a few European and American films that were popular in Shanghai have suffered the misfortune of being banned in Japan, such as "The Private Life of Henry VIII," "Catherine the Great," "Madame Du Barry," etc. Even "The Merry Widow," which caused a sensation in Shanghai this time, suffered a cruel editing disaster. Why these films, which Shanghai people consider "nothing special," are banned, the reason can only be left to the intelligent readers to ponder for themselves.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don't have much expectation for Japanese films. The first film I saw after arriving in Tokyo, "Express Train," made me "unable to bear to finish watching" and I left halfway through. This is a extremely inferior work that is verbose, chaotic, and unable to even tell a story. The director, however, is Uehara Takehiko, who was already "quite famous" ten years ago! With decent equipment, even the most basic existing directors in China can make such a work. So I harbored some disrespectful feelings towards Japanese films. But a week ago, because the general newspapers excessively praised it, I finally went to the "Japan Theater" mentioned above to see a film called "Two Wives." As a work of art, this is by no means a praiseworthy work, but in terms of technology and acting skills alone, this can indeed be said to be a very decent sound film that has reached world standards. The original work is by the popular writer Nakano Minoru, the director is Naruse Mikio, and the actors are the famous actors of the former Tsukiji Little Theater, Maruyama Sadao, Hanabusa Yae, and P.C.L.'s new junior Chiba Tokuko. (The names of Maruyama and Hanabusa reminded me of the pleasant Tokyo days. His outstanding performance as Lopakhin in Chekhov's famous play "The Cherry Orchard" in Sakae-za is still clearly remembered!) The content of the story is about a man who marries a female singer and has a daughter. Because of incompatibility, he separates from his wife, and later marries a woman from a geisha background in the northern country and has children. At the beginning of the film, the daughter born to the first wife has reached the age of engagement. In order to ask her father to come forward to handle the marriage, she volunteers to go to Shinshu to find her father. In her expectation, she thought that her father and his second wife must be living a life of pleasure, but when she arrived there, the facts were completely contrary to her expectations. Her stepmother is a very "virtuous" woman who not only loves her husband, but also secretly sends money to the first wife in Tokyo every month without her husband's knowledge. She feels that she should not take her father away from this kind family, so after her father handles her marriage in Tokyo, she does not retain him on behalf of her mother and lets her father return. Judging from the story, the author's worldview is still hovering in the late Meiji and early Taisho eras. Today, it can be said that it has a hint of commonality with the Women's Association's advocacy of "wise wife and good mother" promoted by the military. Here, the director only uses the perspective of the daughter of the first wife (who should be a modern woman in appearance) to observe the relationship between men and women in the Meiji era without any opinion. He not only does not add any criticism or explanation, but even greatly admires the wise wife and good mother and gives it full praise. This is why this film can only make people happy but cannot make people feel deeply. However, in terms of acting skills, direction, and especially the use of radio, we must not underestimate its success. I don't understand, why, with such material and human environments, are they not producing some higher-level works?</p>
<p>In addition to P.C.L., Shochiku, Nikkatsu, and Shinko all have domestically produced aftersound machines, but in essence, except for P.C.L.'s machine, which is slightly better than the celebrity's machine, Nikkatsu's is similar to China's Sanyou type and even Zhonghua Tong type, and the emerging Oriental Sy-stem is only at the level of a Chinese self-made radio a year ago.</p>
<p>For the film "Two Wives," I waited in the drizzle for almost half an hour. Since the beginning of autumn, it is said that this "Japan Theater" has encountered "business as terrible as murder." Most Japanese cinemas sell tickets without restrictions, so when passing through Yurakucho, you often see the struggle of "seats are full, only three seats are available," but the people buying tickets are still meandering like a long snake. Also seeing a glimpse of the magic of this script.</p>
<h3>The "Poetry Revolution" in the Late Qing Dynasty</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>In the late Qing Dynasty, there was a so-called "Poetry Revolution" in literature, which was corresponding to the so-called "Reform Movement" in politics. In other words, there was a reform movement in politics before there was a reform movement in literature. In fact, the poetry revolution at that time was only a reform, not a revolution. Moreover, the political reform failed, and the literary reform also failed.</p>
<p>This is a long story, so I can only say it briefly.</p>
<p>The reformists in literature were also the reformists in politics, such as Tan Sitong, Xia Zengyou, Liang Qichao, and Huang Zunxian. Of course, Kang Youwei also belonged to this faction, but he initially only paid attention to politics. It was only after the political failure that he paid attention to writing poetry. Moreover, he was more mature and steady. No matter how new he was in poetry, there were limits after all.</p>
<p>Tan Sitong can be regarded as the first vanguard general of the reformists. He did not lose the stubbornness of the Hunan people. He failed in politics and refused to escape. This is the rebellious spirit of a revolutionary and the martyrdom spirit of a religious person. It is a pity that he was killed. His so-called "new learning" poetry, like his new political ideals, did not fulfill his original aspirations.</p>
<p>Xia Zengyou had not yet run onto the political stage. Fortunately, he did not die with Tan Sitong, but unfortunately, he never dared to come forward again in the literary reform movement. Of course, his new learning poetry, only "snatching new terms" and "new contract words, endlessly at the tip of the pen," even his companions like Liang Qichao said "impossible to understand," which shows that it was conceivable that he would never get through it if he continued. Liang Qichao said that "at that time in the motherland, there was not a single book on philosophy, politics, and law to read. Two or three of us claimed to be the first to get the atmosphere, but the level of our thinking was like this." This is indeed an honest statement. Their reform movement, whether political or literary, ended in failure. Although it is said that it was due to the objective environment that did not allow it, and the subjective strength was not enough, it cannot be said that this was not a major reason.</p>
<p>Although the political reform of 1898 failed, because of the invasion of the Eight-Nation Alliance in 1900, the autocratic Qing government thought of holding a few "new policies" again. In short, after three very painful experiences in 1894, 1898, and 1900, a little new dawn seemed to be revealed in politics again. At the same time, in literature, no, in poetry, being able to slightly reflect the politics and society of this painful era, and being able to be representative of the poetry of this era, we have to promote Huang Zunxian's Renjinglu Poetry Draft for a little achievement in the so-called "poetry revolution".</p>
<p>After Huang Zunxian failed in politics, he closed his doors to read and write poetry. He was considered a new figure who slightly understood the international situation at that time. He had been a diplomat for many years, and he had been to Japan, India, Nanyang, the United States, and other places. He was one of the most knowledgeable and learned among the reformers. Since he was not successful in politics, he put all his energy into poetry. Therefore, his achievements in poetry were greater than anyone else at the same time. Liang Qichao said that "among modern poets who can melt new ideals into old styles, Huang Gongdu is the most worthy." This is correct. Strictly speaking, he is still only a reformist in the poetry world, not a revolutionary. Because he is still circling in the old style. However, his poetry materials are slightly richer than those of the ancients. He not only occasionally adopts dialects and proverbs, but he can also "write down whatever objects, uncharted realms, and experiences of the ear and eye the ancients did not have." It is a pity that his hearing and sight are limited, and what he writes is not much. As for what he said: "I write what I say, the ancient halls can restrain. Even if it is colloquial, I will register it on silk. People five thousand years later will be surprised to see it as ancient and colorful." He himself did not truly practice this proposition of his. His Nine Mountain Songs, although imitating the tunes of folk songs, are only occasional attempts. Later, Mr. Hu Shi's vernacular poems in his Collection of Experiments can be said to be the implementation of Huang Zunxian's proposition of "I write what I say." If we want to regard Huang Zunxian as a pioneer of the "poetry revolution," he really has the spirit and courage of a pioneer. Kang Youwei's theory of poetry is that "new worlds and bizarre realms are born, and new sounds are created by searching Europe and Asia." In fact, his poetry is only in the old style, not a new sound. It is not considered that he has grasped this bizarre new world, and it is in vain to have traveled around the world. As for what he said, "the artistic conception is almost without Li Du, and where do I put Yuan and Ming in my eyes," it may be true that he did not learn the poems of the Yuan and Ming people. He could not learn from Li Du, even though he had read Du Ji. Some people put him on a par with Huang Zunxian because he had been the leader of the political reformists.</p>
<p>In those days, Huang Zunxian's "new poetry style" was famous, and Liang Qichao's "new prose style" was even more famous. Mr. Liang was famous all over the world, but he had no reputation as a poet. He did not like to write poetry, but he liked to talk about poetry. In his poems, he advocated patriotism, martial arts, reform, self-reliance, civil rights, and equality, which was generally similar to Huang Zunxian and other new school poets. He did not express complaints or groans in his poems, but loved to say exaggerated personal words and actively enterprising words, which was different from any other poet at the same time. He said, "If I don't write poetry today, then that's it. If I write poetry, I must be the Columbus and Magellan of the poetry world before it is possible. It is like the land of Europe has been prosperous, and new lands must be sought in America and along the Pacific coast. If you want to be the Columbus and Magellan of the poetry world, you must have three strengths: First, you must have a new artistic conception; second, you must have new words and sentences; and you must also enter it in the style of the ancients, and then it will become poetry." This is what he said when he was traveling in Honolulu in 1898. It has been nearly forty years, and today it seems to be a shallow and ordinary remark, but at that time, it had a different meaning. He knew that he had to "try his best to import the spirit and thoughts of Europe to provide the poetry materials for the future." He knew that "if China does not have a poetry revolution, then the fate of poetry will be exhausted." He knew that "the opportunity for revolution is gradually ripening." In the literary revolution, he cannot be regarded as the first prophet. It is a pity that he almost put all his energy on political commentary. Although he created a "new prose style," he did not create a new poetry style. If he had been willing to write more poetry, with his talent and unrestrained writing, and established a little momentum for the so-called poetry revolution since Tan Sitong and Xia Zengyou, it would have been greater than what Huang Zunxian had established, I think it is possible.</p>
<p>In all fairness, this "Poetry Revolution" cannot but be said to have failed. However, in this experience of failure, we were given several very valuable lessons. First, they originally wanted to "melt new ideals into old styles." In other words, they wanted to put new content into old forms. As a result, we know that if the form does not change, some new content cannot be put in. To express the new phenomena and new ideas of this great era, it is necessary to create a new form, even though the old poetry style still has its uses in certain situations. Second, they are still officials and intellectuals. Their "Poetry Revolution" was to promote the "reform" of the monarchical politics, and to shout for their own class; it was not to serve the public, and their poems had nothing to do with the public. Of course, the public at that time, the more aware public, would not support their movement either. What's more, the awakening of the public still relies on poetry and other literary departments, and even the entire cultural education, to jointly fulfill the responsibility of arousing it! Third, they wanted to adopt dialects and proverbs close to the public to write poetry, and although they did not practice it, this theory is correct.</p>
<p>As for the opinions and works of this group of poets, there are citations and introductions in my books: "Changes in Modern Chinese Literature" and "A History of Chinese Literature in the Last Thirty Years." I will not repeat them here.</p>
<p>There are also those who stood on the opposite side of this new school of poets and can be regarded as pure old school poets, such as the retro school Wang Lanyun. He said that his poems were just "a hodgepodge of imitations," which is correct. He said, "Everything is new in the last fifty years, and the lines will surely be startling." But he did not write any startling poems that could be praised for contemporary new things. There was also the so-called "Tongguang Style" of Shen Zengzhi, Chen Sanli, etc. Originally, some poets during the Tongzhi and Guangxu years promoted the study of Song poetry, and the poetry of the Huangshangu and Wangjinggong schools, which became a trend for a time. Some people called it the "Song Poetry Movement." This movement was a step backward, while the poetry revolution movement was progressive. Those who went backward had to imitate a certain generation, a certain school, or a certain person in ancient times when writing poetry; those who were more progressive wanted to adopt the spirit and thoughts of modern Europeans as poetry materials and did not hesitate to start their own schools. Those who went backward had to fill in difficult words and create awkward sentences when writing poetry; those who were more progressive wanted to use dialects and proverbs, and wanted to use new terms and new sentences when writing poetry. There were also the talented people Fan Fanshan and Yi Shifu. Their poems were greedy for quantity and competed for skill, showing off their romanticism. They liked to stack rhymes a lot, liked to make clever antithetical couplets, liked to praise actors, and liked to play with women. They lived a decadent life of enjoyment, and poetry was a record of this life. Among the old school poets, they were the most depraved. In short, after these many old school poets' spiritual works, all the disadvantages of old style poetry were exposed. It seems that the poetry revolution movement was able to survive thanks to their help. Therefore, Huang Zunxian became the only great poet in the late Qing Dynasty.</p>
<h3>A Short Account of Climbing the Mountain at Dusk</h3>
<p>— Shen Shengshi</p>
<p>The golden light of the setting sun splashed the mountain slopes red.</p>
<p>All three of us loved climbing mountains at dusk.</p>
<p>The mountain slope was quietly devoid of tourists. Among the massive rocks, the three of us seemed like three small crawling insects. The magnificence of the mountain highlighted the insignificance of life.</p>
<p>Huge rocks, like gigantic monsters, squatted on the mountainside, their faces covered in mossy patches. As we climbed, our feet slipped, refusing to be controlled, so we clung tightly to clumps of weeds, carefully ascending.</p>
<p>Halfway up, I embraced a massive boulder, foolishly searching for traces of history from thousands of years past. However, the stone face bore only rough marks, a weathered and ancient countenance.</p>
<p>We climbed together to a large grotto, where we sat down to rest. Above us was the vast sky. Looking into the distance, the twilight, like a thin mist, descended from all sides, descending, descending. A purplish-dark cloud lingered over the smoky trees, gradually blending together. A vast expanse of city streets and villages also sank into the hazy obscurity.</p>
<p>After the setting sun had completely faded, the mountain wind brought a chilling coolness.</p>
<p>Looking up at the high peaks, huge rocks piled upon rocks, crowded together, the mountain color turned purplish-dark, and the mountain wind brought a chilling, gloomy air.</p>
<p>Dusk enveloped the mountain, and an atmosphere of coldness pressed in on us.</p>
<p>In the foolish silence of the three of us, I searched for the stars leaking out from the edge of the sky. One, two, sparsely.</p>
<p>Let's climb down before it gets completely dark.</p>
<p>The mountain night is filled with dark and cold thoughts. A sense of coldness touches the heart.</p>
<p>A friend said:</p>
<p>The mountain at night is not suitable for an ordinary person to stay. In the faint moonlight, graceful immortals from myths come out for a night stroll, floating ethereally. Groups of three or two celestial children sing on the mountainside. This scene is truly an ideal beauty.</p>
<p>Clinging to tree trunks and exposed roots, we climbed down. The sky was already dark, and the small protruding stones on the mountain path under our feet were not clearly visible. A moment of carelessness could cause a stumble. Everyone called out, feeling for the path we had come up. Unnoticed, huge rocks squatted like giant demons, blocking our way.</p>
<p>When we reached the foot of the mountain, sweat had soaked everyone's foreheads, and the soles of our feet were burning.</p>
<p>Looking back at the mountain peak, a crescent moon slowly ascended from the deep blue horizon.</p>
<h3>Brothers Who Didn’t Turn in Their Uniforms</h3>
<h3>Life</h3>
<p>— Mo Fu</p>
<p>Life is a rubber bladder. If you don't have some backbone, it will shrink and constrict you tightly, to an unimaginably small extent. At the same time, it can be stretched to infinite proportions, even if it is empty inside, leaving most people unable to grasp the boundaries and unable to guess what treasures it contains.</p>
<p>One gloomy, cold morning, I was still lying in bed, haphazardly thinking about things that I myself wasn't entirely clear about. A long-lost acquaintance suddenly arrived, just as he had when he left this place, without leaving a trace.</p>
<p>"Ah!" he exclaimed in surprise, as if he had seen something frightening. "I thought you had already left here. I was just coming to see if I could find you..."</p>
<p>He didn't allow me to reply, repeating several times, "How did you manage to stay here?..."</p>
<p>"How did I manage? ... Twenty-four hours a day."</p>
<p>Beyond that, I couldn't say anything more specific or detailed.</p>
<p>His question prompted me to think about the question—how did I manage to stay here? I certainly hadn't realized it. I had neither the skills nor the opportunity to produce anything, and moreover—here I want to quote a line from the Greek poet Marcus Argentarius: "...A person who has nothing has no friends!" In this situation, I never expected to stay so long. Looking back, it's simply a chaotic dream. When I was hungry, I found a way to get credit at a restaurant; when the landlord demanded rent, I tried my best to stall; and I even managed to coax kerosene from the bridge watchman; and I tricked (perhaps this word is the most appropriate, but he trusted me a lot) coal briquettes from the Yi Xishan Red Coal Factory; and somewhere, even though it was to be expected, I unexpectedly received some extra money. And so, all year round... wow, it's a miracle!</p>
<p>"What are your plans for the future?"</p>
<p>"What can I do? ... I take it one day at a time."</p>
<p>After a brief account of our separation, he left in a hurry. The warmth he brought was taken away with him. My small room remained cold.</p>
<p>Standing there blankly, observing the things around me, I smiled—I felt like I really smiled.</p>
<p>"Anyway, I will continue to live, I must continue to live, I have the right to live, ... until the end of my life."</p>
<h3>An Ode to Shenzhen</h3>
<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>Winding around the nine-bend bridge;</p>
<p>There is a dog racing track there,</p>
<p>There is a gambling den,</p>
<p>All day, all night,</p>
<p>Seductive songs are swirling.</p>
<p>Red neon lights,</p>
<p>Dazzling brilliance;</p>
<p>Also, women's breasts,</p>
<p>Hazy night,</p>
<p>Can't see the lonely stars in the sky,</p>
<p>Can't see the misery of the people in the semi-colony.</p>
<p>This is just a scene of intense frenzy.</p>
<p>Shenzhen! is a paradise for pleasure-seekers,</p>
<p>Is a vast and fertile square.</p>
<p>The oppressors' flags are fluttering,</p>
<p>On the tracks of the Guangzhou-Kowloon Railway.</p>
<p>But, it's no use going in without money,</p>
<p>It only welcomes—</p>
<p>High-class Chinese, compradors,</p>
<p>A soulless crowd.</p>
<p>Using our homeland,</p>
<p>Using our labor,</p>
<p>Developing it day by day,</p>

<p>Look! Whose paradise of pleasure is that?</p>

<h3>"Aspiring to Save the Country"</h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>Yin Rugeng, the administrative inspector of the Luan-Yu district in Hebei Province, betrayed the country, declared independence, established the so-called Jidong Anti-Communist Committee, appointed himself as the chairman, and severed ties with the country. The national government has now ordered a campaign to suppress him. However, according to a report in the newspaper the other day, Yin Rugeng even told reporters that this move was "aimed at saving the country." This is truly "the greatest absurdity under heaven." If this can be called aspiring to save the country, then what is the difference between betraying the country and saving it? With this kind of interpretation of saving the country, we really feel at a loss as to where to begin saving the country.</p>
<p>A traitor does not necessarily claim to be a traitor. He can use all kinds of means to betray the country, but he will never openly say that he is betraying the country. He will surely use some nice-sounding terms or pretexts to cover up his treacherous behavior, and may even say that he is saving the country. This is a common practice throughout history, both in China and abroad. Zheng Xiaoxu was truly acting as someone else's slave, but he would never admit that he was acting as a slave. Perhaps he would say that he was being "loyal to the former dynasty" and wanted to "rescue the people from fire and water." Would a thief admit to being a thief? No matter how shameful and despicable his actual actions may be, he can always say something beautiful. Yin Rugeng is just one of these people. Moreover, compared to other great traitors (such as Zheng Xiaoxu), he is truly insignificant!</p>
<p>However, will the shamelessness and baseness of these people, because of their skillful cover-ups, mean that their true nature will never be discovered by us? No, that's not the case. It depends on whether the actual actions of these people match their words. Yin Rugeng sings loudly about "aspiring to save the country," but the things he is doing are clearly betraying the country. Who can be deceived by this? Saving the country requires facts! No matter how you try to cover up treacherous actions, people can still see them very clearly. Who would believe that Yin Rugeng is truly "aspiring to save the country"? People's eyes are sharp!</p>
<p>There are many people like Yin Rugeng active before our eyes. Unfortunately, the national government's decree of suppression only applies to Yin Rugeng alone. I can't help but feel wronged for Yin Rugeng!</p>
<h3>Arranging a Marriage (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Shen Qianli</p>
<p>(III)</p>
<p>"Haha, mother and daughter are different after all. You have private things to say, so you run outside to talk!"</p>
<p>"What are you doing here, Yun'er?" Her face was as tight as a drum.</p>
<p>"Runweng! You're going to scare her! You can't do that!" He laughed dryly.</p>
<p>"No, I'm not joking with her," he said seriously, his face expressionless, like a father scolding his son. "I'll be honest with you. If you want to marry me, just give up on that poor kid. Don't associate with him anymore. Otherwise, your mother still owes me two hundred yuan. I can marry a woman anywhere I go..."</p>
<p>"Alright, Runweng! Don't scare her. How could such a beautiful girl like her be hooking up with those poor kids? Sigh! I still thought you were a terrestrial immortal. You're worrying too much for an immortal..." The speaker's small eyes glanced sideways at the gentleman's face, and seeing that he was unmoved by her words, she stopped speaking.</p>
<p>"This is your mother here. Marrying you wouldn't mean you'd suffer any grievances," he said, taking a sip of hot tea, followed by a "hiss." The smell of tobacco made Yunying, who was standing not far from him, consciously take a step back. He didn't seem to notice and continued seriously, "At first, I told your mother that if you agreed to marry me, I wouldn't ask her to repay the two hundred yuan. I'd also give her an additional hundred yuan as a bride price. From then on, we'd be relatives. If she has nothing to do, she can help me a little and have a free meal at my house. Don't you think this idea suits your wishes?" A hint of a smile flashed across his face, but he immediately suppressed it when Yunying looked up.</p>
<p>"Runweng! You're really an old hand at romance, thinking of everything in such excruciating detail! We're truly ashamed of ourselves! Haha..."</p>
<p>"Everything that Master Run does is right. It's just that I was born with a hard life, and I only raised such a daughter." Tears welled up in her eyes, secretly flowing.</p>
<p>"You only have this one daughter. No one is going to eat her, what are you crying about?" Her words cut off her lament like a knife. "It's not that I'm afraid people will eat her. If she follows Master Run, would anyone dare to touch a hair on her head? I'm just saying that she's seventeen years old this year and has never left my side for a moment. She doesn't understand anything and I'm afraid she won't be able to serve Master Run in the future and will make you angry!" Her vocal cords seemed to have snapped, and she couldn't help but sob.</p>
<p>"Mom, you promised him, what are you still crying about? I'll just have to accept my fate!" She glared at the gentleman, her expression as hard as iron.</p>
<p>At this moment, he jumped out of bed involuntarily, grabbed her arm, and brought his withered face close to hers. His bones seemed to have softened halfway as he bent over and hugged her tightly. "Good girl, how did your mother give you such a sharp tongue? All the anger in my belly was driven away by your few words. Come here, don't upset me anymore. Come, give me a kiss, give me a kiss..."</p>
<p>"No, no, this won't do. What will it look like?" She curled up her head and face like a hedgehog, holding her hands tightly.</p>
<p>"Alright, Master Run! If you push her too hard, she'll get angry!" A tear fell in the middle of her words. "Haha... a daughter is still a daughter, a son-in-law should be different..." Another burst of laughter. (End)</p>
<p>(Yesterday, due to space constraints, it was not possible to publish it. I would like to apologize to the author and readers.)</p>
<h3>Snow</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>Last winter, I lived in a small town. It was surrounded by severe cold all day long. In the morning, when I opened the window and looked out, a vast white expanse of snow unfolded. Facing this frank snowfield, my melancholy heart immediately put on a layer of cheerful tune.</p>
<p>A friend and I lived on the third floor of a house. This house was a relative's villa, outside the town. He moved here in the summer, and in the winter he still lived in his town residence. I came down from the university and couldn't find a job. My relative meant for me to stay here and have fun. Anyway, the family hadn't gone bankrupt at that time. I lived with this friend: he returned from Beijing to this small town, and was also very lonely. Being together might be better—each doing his own thing, and when there was nothing to do, we'd play together.</p>
<p>But we really didn't have anything to do, we spent about half our time this way.</p>
<p>One morning, I was preparing to write a letter to my older brother in Shanghai when he came in. He was wearing an apricot-yellow morning gown and sat on the sofa. He didn't like to talk, even though we were together. There wasn't much conversation. For example, he read the newspaper all day, but I didn't. To be honest, I didn't have the courage to read the newspaper. Every day, even in this small town, robberies occurred frequently. The news would make you sick, so why look at it? But he had to read the newspaper.</p>
<p>"Fourteen people were executed yesterday! All of them were young—only one was an old man in his fifties!"</p>
<p>His face was very calm, like a cup of still white water. He seemed to be trying to stir my heart, but in reality, I hated listening to it. Moreover, this kind of cliché news had lost its stimulating effect. On my dull eardrums, he would no longer be moved by it. I looked at his face, nodded my head, and pushed one of the two cups of milk that his nanny had prepared for him.</p>
<p>"It's going to get cold soon—drink it and go out for a run. The snow scene is very beautiful today!"</p>
<p>Maybe he could tell that I didn't like hearing these things, because he didn't continue speaking. I told him that in this era, we were just supporting actors, not important at all. Let the world change as it may. No matter what kind of world it becomes, we useless people will still be useless. Moreover, a person like him, who lacks courage, shouldn't worry. I understood this world very well. I had read about it in my university courses. But, I was still playing the role of a supporting character. I didn't want to be a protagonist and take on the task of changing this era. He listened to my words, was spoken to by me, and drank the milk. He said to me:</p>
<p>"There's another piece of news that's a bit related to you!</p>
<p>"Another piece of news related to me? Let's go!"</p>
<p>I said to him nonchalantly. So, we listened to the sound of silence in the snow, and looked back. A long trail of footprints was hidden in the white. Facing the shining snow, looking at the distant trees and the sea-blue sky, I sang a poem by Shelley, and he sang Heine's "Struggle Song," his voice high and excited, which surprised me, given his usually quiet throat.</p>
<p>Climbing mountains in the snow is the most interesting thing. It's like a person searching for his own path in a pool of blood. We climbed mountains, climbed trees, and a whole morning passed. Our bodies were hot, full of heat.</p>
<p>On the way back, I went to another friend's house, and he went back by himself.</p>
<p>When I returned home, it was already dusk. The distant mountain shadows were faintly visible in the white.</p>
<p>The nanny gave me a letter:</p>
<p>"Old Zhang: I'm leaving. You said I didn't have courage, I'll try to have it. Maybe I will.</p>
<p>Here's a piece of news about you. I hope you'll read it?</p>
<p>See you later. I wish you good fortune. Jin."</p>
<p>"When did she give it to you?"</p>
<p>"This afternoon."</p>
<p>I sat on the sofa and read the newspaper article. It said that the bank in Shanghai where my older brother worked had gone bankrupt. There was also another article saying that things were very tight everywhere these days: the end of the year was approaching, bankruptcies, executions, were happening everywhere.</p>
<p>Did he leave because of this? Yes, he left because of this. The next day, I received a telegram from my older brother saying that he was preparing to return to this small town immediately to take refuge. However, the next day's newspaper said that he had been detained.</p>
<p>So, I left that place and came here. Living here, without milk, without a nanny, I am "living."</p>

<h3>Morning</h3>
<p>— Bin</p>
<p>My wife took the shopping basket to the kitchen, leaving the child in the room. Recently, I lost my job and have been idle at home, so I moved out an old bookshelf. It's full of books that I like, but since I bought them, I've never had time to flip through more than a few pages. Now that I'm stuck at home all day, I want to dig up some new knowledge from them as a spiritual compensation after losing my job. But in the morning, my wife came back from shopping for groceries and went to the kitchen to cook. The child was shut up in this small bedroom, making trouble everywhere. Either he broke something, or he fell and cried loudly. There wasn't a minute of quiet to let me flip through a few pages of a book. Because of this, I bought a pile of cheap toys for him to play with on his own. For the past few days, thanks to these new things, the child has been quietly playing with the toys in a corner without making a sound. But these few cheap toys, after three or five days, have become a pile of unsightly garbage, and the child has returned to his normal state. Today, he was making noise again, and I gave him a beating, but my wife heard the crying and ran upstairs to nag. She said angrily that I was useless, that a man couldn't earn money and instead stayed at home all day beating the child. Later, she even said that marrying me was her bad luck. In a fit of anger, she picked up the child and went downstairs.</p>
<p>After losing my job, relatives and friends also lost that kind of mutually supportive relationship between human beings. Staying at home is naturally not what I want, but I can no longer afford to visit relatives and friends. As soon as they see your face, it's as if your expression tells them that you're there to borrow money. Before you can even open your mouth, you can hear a string of complaints about the bad economy and how hard it is to do business, their faces drawn tight, as if a disaster is about to befall them, making you feel like you're sitting on pins and needles, too embarrassed to freeload a meal. I understand this art of living. Poverty is still my own. Reading a book is better than chatting at a friend's house anyway, but women have their own incomprehensible logic. This is my first new discovery.</p>
<p>But the fact is that in this society where economic relations maintain order, a husband has an obligation to support his wife. Staying at home reading broken books after losing my job makes me seem out of touch. So, I put on my felt hat and went out onto the street.</p>
<p>It's already winter, and the plane trees along the road are all bald. The sun shines on my thin cotton robe, and I feel a kind of warm comfort. After wandering past a few streets, I thought about a place where I could sit for a while, a place that wouldn't see me as a tactless debt collector. My mind flipped through a record book, going through all the relatives and friends I knew, one by one. But when their ugly faces appeared before me, I generously discarded them one by one. Finally, inspired by a school, I went straight to the house of a former professor.</p>
<p>At school, the professor was very fond of me. He often liked me to go to his house to chat. The professor's wife knew that I was her husband's prized student and was especially warm and welcoming. Even when the professor wasn't home, she would keep me for dinner and chat. I rang the doorbell of that small Western-style house, almost as if I had discovered a treasure. The professor himself came to open the door. When he saw me, he pushed up his rimless glasses and hugged me into the house like a child, while shouting his wife's name loudly. The professor was really very happy. He said that he missed our classmates very much. He said that between teachers and students at school, they still had to maintain a layer of dignity, but after graduation, they should visit each other often like family. He said many things in one breath, things that I hadn't heard from anyone in the past few months. When the professor's wife stepped into the parlor, he began to ask about my recent situation. My answer stunned him. He subconsciously pushed up his glasses again and said, "The dead end of the intellectual class, the dead end of the intellectual class! I haven't seen a single one of my students achieve the kind of position in society that I hoped for. No wonder the number of students in schools decreases every year. Universal education is really easier said than done!" The professor paced the parlor with emotion.</p>
<p>The professor's wife told me that the number of students was decreasing every year, and the school's funds were insufficient to cover expenses. They were already three months behind on salary! I looked at the professor's face, that long face. I thought I should leave. I don't need complaints and sympathy. This society, or rather this world, no longer has a place where I can sit for a while.</p>
<p>When I returned home, the child climbed onto the table and grabbed the food with his fingers. The sun was already high overhead. The morning had passed. What about the afternoon? Still that endless series of days following behind you?</p>

A jade maiden descended from the ninth heaven. Crying for you, serene, dignified, virtuous, and prudent. Fit to scold, fit to smile, you pleased my heart. Crying for you, with unparalleled intelligence and ingenious mind. With penetrating and sharp understanding, you were truly talented. Crying for you, with a straightforward and upright heart like a man, innocent and genuine, like a child. Qing Wen, which of the four beauties can compare to you? Among women, past and present, you can be called the best. We relied on each other, morning and night, for only a few years. How did I accumulate such ill fortune to have a fairy accompany my impure jade? Qing Wen, sometimes I recited books on freezing winter days. Only you, kept me company all night, unafraid of the cold. Qing Wen, sewing a fur coat while ill, your care was so profound. Each thread was made with painstaking effort. Qing Wen, the Wang family hag truly deserves to die. Spreading rumors and daring to slander. Qing Wen, madam listened to malicious gossip. Forced you to return, like boiling cranes and burning zithers. I stood by, silently, it shouldn't have been.

<p>Since Mr. Xu Jingsheng of the Era Society began dating Miss Fang Yunhe, it has been over a year. They have now obtained the consent of both parents, and it is rumored that they will hold a wedding ceremony at the Hangzhou Hotel on December 24th. The best man will be Zhu Shuya, the president of the Era Society. The bridesmaid is unknown, but it is said that she is quite beautiful. It is also rumored that Mr. Xu announced to his friends on the engagement day that all relatives and friends attending the wedding will receive a sweet kiss from the bride. It is expected that there will be extraordinary fun at that time, and so on.</p>
<p>Editor's note: This manuscript was sent by the Era Society, so it is published as above. Also, regarding the "Rumors from the Past" published on the 26th, the Era Society's Xu Jingsheng also stated that he will officially marry on December 24th, and that "Rumors from the Past," etc., are "not true." Some people misunderstood "Rumors from the Past" as being connected to Mr. Xu's wedding, leading to a misunderstanding, so this is specifically stated. "Rumors from the Past" means "rumors that someone lives in Ireland." The editor's good intentions were in vain, alas!</p>

<h3>Silver Jottings</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>"The Inspector General" will make a comeback next Friday (December 6th) at the Lake Society, with a three-day run.</p>
<p>The Electrics Troupe's "Resurrection" is currently in active rehearsal and is said to be progressing smoothly. It is expected to be staged within the next month.</p>
<p>It is rumored that when Pan Yousheng invited Yuan Meiyun to be the bridesmaid, he said, "Chen Jiazhen is causing trouble outside, I'm going to stop his business."</p>
<p>Pan Yousheng stops Chen Jiazhen's business and wants to tell Yuan Meiyun, and he said it when inviting her to be the bridesmaid, how wonderful. I wonder what Yuan Meiyun felt in her heart, and I wonder if Yuan Meiyun had anything else to say at the time?</p>
<p>Some say that when Pan Yousheng was inspecting the gifts sent by various parties, he sighed and said, "If I had known this, why would I have sent so many invitations!" Most of the gifts sent by various parties were wedding canopies and hanging scrolls that could only be hung and displayed at the wedding and were useless afterward. Some even had five or six people jointly sending a wedding canopy.</p>
<p>Someone said: Mr. Pan is ultimately a businessman. Although there is no abacus in the "foreign firm," I think there must be a "mechanical abacus."</p>
<p>May I ask, how does the income and expenditure of this wedding balance out?</p>
<p>Someone said: The Pan-Hu wedding used the Four Shan Hall and spent a total of six large ocean. Even if it loses money, it won't lose much.</p>
<h3>"Boatwoman" Premieres Today</h3>
<p>Free Songsheets and Scales</p>
<p>Directed by Shen Xiling, starring Gao Zhanfei, Xu Lai, and Sun Min, the all-dialogue and singing sound film "Boatwoman," recently produced by the Mingxing Film Company, is scheduled to premiere today at the Jincheng Theater on Beijing Road. In order to enhance the audience's interest and increase their knowledge of film, a copy has been reprinted, and 10,000 pieces of scales have been cut from this copy, along with a finely printed songbook (containing "West Lake Spring Dawn," "Boat Song," and "Goddess Song"), which will be given to the audience with the Jincheng Theater tickets. The company will first pre-select 50 feet and keep them safe. After the event, the scale with the selected portion will be revealed. If any audience member receives a scale identical to the selected one, they will receive a photograph of the protagonist of "Boatwoman" (as specified by the audience member). However, the interest can be greatly increased by comparing the scale with the action on the screen. However, due to restrictions, the photographs will be given out until they are gone. Therefore, those who wish to obtain the scales and the photograph of the protagonist of "Boatwoman" are requested to be quick to arrive first so as not to regret being too late. The songbook is not limited. It is also rumored that "Boatwoman" will have a public screening at the Jincheng Theater at 10 AM this morning, and invitations have been sent to people from all walks of life to attend.</p>
<h3>Mingxing's New Film "Boatwoman"</h3>
<p>— Directed by Shen Xiling, starring Gao Zhanfei, Xu Lai, and Sun Min</p>
<h3>New Film Introductions</h3>
<p>East Wind and Begonia</p>
<p>Chinese and foreign movie fans consider Joan Crawford to be the standard modern daughter. She recently married Franchot Tone. The story of their love has long been a world-famous tale, and Joan boldly displays a new posture in her latest masterpiece, "East Wind and Begonia," especially opening up a new path for the study of "kisses." The supporting male lead is the Scottish tough guy Brian Aherne, and the humorous master of "The Gay Divorcee," Frank Morgan, also participates. The film is produced by MGM and is now showing in Nanjing.</p>
<p>The Dark Angel</p>
<p>Guy Bolton's world-famous play "The Dark Angel" has now been produced by United Artists and translated as "Tears on the Land of Longing." It is a collaboration between Frederic March, the cinematic genius of literary works such as "Resurrection" and "Les Misérables," British standard beauty Merle Oberon, and Herbert Marshall, who recently co-starred with Garbo. The poignant and glamorous nature of the play is no less than that of China's Dream of the Red Chamber and Romance of the West Chamber, so European and American men and women often regard it as a sacred book for discussing love. Therefore, it goes without saying that its screen performance can resonate with the hearts of lovers around the world. The director of the film is Sidney Franklin, the director of massive productions such as "The Good Earth" and "Smilin' Through."</p>
<p>Rendesvouz</p>
<p>Since the First World War, international espionage and counter-espionage in Washington when the United States entered the war were extremely active. The book "Black Chamber" provides a comprehensive overview of this situation. The book was originally a secret treasure translated worldwide. MGM selected the most exciting parts of the book, including the secret assembly of the Allied naval and land forces, and the German adoption of submarine policies using espionage to steal American radio telegrams to carry out threats of surprise attacks, and filmed them into a film called "Rendesvouz," now translated as "Washington's Big Secret." Starring William Powell, it is truly a rare and great military espionage film.</p>
<p>In addition, Weissmuller of "Tarzan the Ape Man" will again co-star with Maureen O'Sullivan in a "Tarzan" film originally titled "The Tarzan Escapes," which is more magnificent and exciting than "Tarzan and His Mate." Movie fans at sea, wait and see. (According to the "Tarzan" series of films, there is now a new film starring world sports champion Herman Brix, called "New Adventures of Tarzan," which is well worth seeing and will be shown at the Grand Shanghai.)</p>
