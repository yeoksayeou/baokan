<p>張公堤金銀潭災情之訪問</p>
<p>漢口當江漢匯流之衝、前爲大江、後爲襄河玉湖、沿江防堤及張公堤、適將市區環抱成一半月形、邊長凡八九十里、堤外汪洋一片、盡成澤國、堤內地勢低下、較水位低至一丈左右、二十年張公堤潰决、漢市平地水深數尺、此次江河徙漲、該堤雖曾略有潰漏、幸防範得力、未蹈二十年覆轍、記者因候溯江再上之輪船、爰先作張公堤視察之行、</p>
<p>二十五日淸晨五時驅車出發、過平漢路軌、都市景象瞥過、鄕村風味迎來、沿路黄稻白蓮、淸香四溢、在晨曦斜照之下、幾疑濯魄於冰壺、前行未及十五里、而姑嫂樹堤工噯唷之聲、血汗之氣、又已迎風送至矣、姑嫂樹爲負堤而居之一小鎭、堤工難民麆集、頗形熱鬧、數日前、附近堤之內坡、忽隱隱下陷於蓮沼、當卽星夜搶救、因堤外月湖、水位高漲、堤內低窪、不能與水勢抗力、遂致打椿椿移、壓土七陷、連打五排大椿、均連榕帶土、漸移塌於蓮沼之內、嗣因水退五六尺、始得倖渡險關、而打椿壓土之工作、迄今猶夙夜匪懈、積極進行也、</p>
<p>其地靠堤遍搭蘆蓆草棚、或爲「江漢工程局」「防水會」「兵工」之辦公處、或爲「善聯會」「市衛生處」「市油業公會」「各慈善圑體」施茶施藥及發饅頭之所、或爲貯備蔴袋蘆卓·竹木·蔴繩·等工料之地、男工多從　打椿築土工作、數十成羣、呼聲遠聞數里、婦女揹土運物、往返奔走、亦若忘其倦意者、便裝軍人及監工職員、則多手拿長竹片、指揮工作、維持秩序、一般零食小販、亦就地設肆於道旁、全塲熙熙攘攘、直若山利之集市、但細察在塲各人眉宇間所顯示出之一種說不出的內在憂慮、畢竟未爲抗赤燄挽狂瀾之緊張空氣所掩飾、此無他、蓋漢市八十餘萬人口牛命財產之安危、皆視此堤能否防範安全爲轉移也、</p>
<p>漢口臨江路漫水景象</p>
<p>沿堤順流下行、約行七八里、又見二十餘工人、正塡補滲漏之處、用土須由蓮沼對岸挖取、往返舟載、亦覺不便、堤內坡地、綠草茸茸、時見牧牛成羣、遠視田畝、穀黃如雲、棉花正開、仍似有大熟之望、惟左顧堤外、駭浪擊堤、時發巨聲、金銀潭·祁家屯·邢家屯·張家屯·等村落、均淪爲水晶宮矣、作物全被洗蕩、村民避居堤上、張蓆爲廬、鑿地爲灶、聊避風雨、苟延殘喘而已、</p>
<p>金銀潭隔堤僅一二里、壁塌柱立、樹枝拂流、晣然可見、買舟渡過、所經似覺甚深、請舟子以槳試之、果深丈五以上、先抵金潭、瓦尾數十椽、四顧皆靑山、蓋門窗竹籬、順水漂去、特磚瓦倒塌遍地、浪沬堆積其上、有一楊姓家、基地較高、，水已退出院外、主人掃除淤泥、擬作歸計、詢其「水未全退、何可急歸」、據答、「堤上草棚、僅可勉以避日、若夜雨襲至、仍不免全身淋漓也」、繼詢村民生活狀况」、答稱、「七月十一日午夜、大水猛至、初漲尺許、天將明、水竟登堂入室、節節上漲五六尺、金潭戶口約一百七十餘戶、銀潭一百一十戶、一時哭聲震野、有如山崩地陷、倉猝各奪小舟木器、冒險浮逃堤邊、麥熟甫穫、瓜甜未摘、人各逃生之不暇、遑論顧及瓜麥、逃出之災民半月來除日前賑會每人散發饅頭二枚外、餘則無日不以水花（浮萍）菱角菜（卽菱葉）麥麩子等爲食、然尙有難繼之虞、倘再不蒙仁人振救、恐水患　生、旋將轉爲陸上餓殍也、主人有一子、年十二三、在黄陂小學肄業、時亦在旁、並爲指殘壁水蹟、以身量之、活潑可愛、主人旋嘆日、「此子差一年卽畢業、成績亦不惡、但從此勢將輟學、奈何奈何」、乃子聞之、雖强作笑容、但童心天眞、淚竟奪眶而出、</p>
<p>轉舟銀潭、景象與金潭相同、惟銀潭於四月十一日、曾遭回祿之災、村民生活苦痛、當更較爲慘烈、登岸見一老婦、率女孫輩、泥足蓬首、收拾水未漂沒之餘燼、乍見記者、疑係　災、跴泥踉蹌來迎、並以衫角揩淚記者料知其意正思安慰之術詎伊忽爲泥滑仰跌一交、趨前將其扶起、彼之女孫、亦已奔至、老婦自怨自艾、且泣且語日「銀潭不出百天、連遭水火兩災、老百姓眞造孽、但做官的不准唱神戲、也有過失、一夜間漲到丈多高水、不是神水是什麼、唉、眞造孽眞造孽」、經記者勸慰走入一較像樣之房院、見中樑上倒轉一床、上藏雜具及木偶、庭柱繫一死犬、已發臭、想因主人匆匆逃出、忘解其繩以致死也、歸舟中、舟子忽以「張學良是否張之洞之子、見問、以其趣甚、反誌「何故」、渠答、「這道張公堤、就是張之洞修的、水大漲時、有靑龍張牙舞爪於湖中、爲張氏所見、許於二十八日起、在姑嫂樹唱神戲三天、故龍昇水退、若張氏眞是張公之子、以後担任防務、可望水災减少」、云云愚氓意外、禍福恒歸之天命、大災之後、尤多附會迷信之說、其情雖不無可原、然亦敎育不普及之破綻也、</p>
<p>後經晒里山·丹水池·分金爐·諸處、繞過日租界江堤、初不知爲日租界第見沿江馬路、堆棄沙袋甚多、堤外風浪　亦覺較江漢關爲大、擬攝一影、旋見袋堆旁立「昇降自由」一牌、因　字句有異頓悟地區所在、特先吿印捕、見其搖首而止、再過特三區二三碼頭之間、十餘工人、在堤外臨汀路赤身沐浴、巡警驟由堤內跳出、抱其衣服而去、此輩妄享江水上岸之便宜、遭此打擊、一時且無法脫離苦海、亦可謂得不償失矣、</p>
<p>張公堤搶修情形</p>
<p>渡江訪省府秘書馮若飛鄧鶴九諾先生、據談、「此次鄂省水災、堤倒五六十處、垸破五百左右、災區面積及人口尙無統計、按報災縣估計、全省產棉區僅餘一二縣、棉收損失達一萬萬元以上、省營業稅收損失、亦將達六七十萬元、報災者共四十九處、雖不完全爲縣、但皆精華所在、漢川天門、至今尙淪水中、其餘水漸退出者、已達過半數、惟急·農·工·賑欵、須一千二百萬元、今所籌獲四十餘萬元、尙不到計劃十分之一、亟盼中央曁社會人士、予以鼎力之贊助」、又謂、「長江上游災情雖重、但究不若襄河流域之甚、且江域如荆門宜昌各重災區、水位都已漸退、而襄域各縣、此刻尙多在水深火熱中、欲往視察、應先擇襄域各縣、惟此路交通不便、征程殊較江輪爲苦」云云、記者因决先往襄城視察、定於二十六日起行、若公路無阻、或由襄襄花路、轉搭平漢車北上、察勘黄災、</p>

<p>黃水未即灌微原因　大堤工程完成大半</p>
<p>徐州通信、魯西河决、黄水灌入南陽湖、以南陽湖與微湖之間、地勢較髙、且無大溜續來、是以黄水未即灌微、即微湖北岸上通中運之夏鎭、亦未見有黃流、惟以蘇北魯南之間、各湖相通、且連日又多大雨、水位不無稍漲、監察使丁超五·專員邵漢元·委員藍渭濱、於二十四日曾由沛城同乘汽軍赴微岸視察、並督看堤工、建廳特派工程師兪漱芳、亦於二十四日由沛往夏鎭察看、設立水標、確知水山南陽湖向北倒溢、故暫時尙未灌入蘇北·徐屬各縣、刻正忙於建築蘇北大堤、及藺家閘堤、並察看運河閘口、魯皖邊境各縣技術員及徐屬各縣技師、連日均集徐察看、各方利害不同、對於堤防之看法亦異、丁邵藍三人、均以爲亟應完成蘇北大堤、藺家壩之堤防、尙待視察復以爲斷、省峰往歲未能顧及江北水利、及今當爲澈底籌劃也、</p>
<p>南陽湖水　溢</p>
<p>黃水自臨濮集决南流、係分兩股注入南陽湖、一股經鉅野入趙王河、注獨山潮以灌南陽湖、一股經嘉祥入牛頭河、以灌南陽潮、兩流爭趨、故南陽湖水盛漲、而南陽湖與微山潮之間、地勢較髙、致湖漲而後、向北倒溢、一部泛往濟寗、一部侵入魚台、刻下魚台濟寗間之郵電已隔絕、而魚台南與徐屬之豐沛接境、豐縣前日派彭世亭黄體潤兩人赴魚台南陽湖一帶視察、魚台東北境之袁窪湖堰、决口二十餘丈、魚台之五區一帶被災類重、該處濱湖有舊堰一道西北起至袁窪、東南接至沛境之程子廟、長八十餘里、魚台正在征集民夫修葺抱堵中南陽湖水因此倒溢之故、未能灌微、是以當昨日丁那藍等視察之際、水位仍吿平穩、夏鎭在沛北邊境、當微湖北岸、爲湖口上通運河之要道、東與魯南臨城相接近、在昔漕運未廢、爲重要之區、沛巳在此設水標、兪工程師昨往察看、未見黄流、倘若大汎不再續來、則蘇北或可免於水厄、惟據建廳及導淮會所派赴魯察看决口之工程飾周玉山趙雨蘇兩氏、由臨濮集視察返徐稱、二十日在决口處視察一日、該處共决六口、第一二口巳淤、第三四口水量甚少、第五口最大、長三百公尺、第六口次之、長一百二十公尺、五六兩口之間、距離約八百公尺、兩口水勢均溜、察看時乘船逆流而上、渡五里之地、費三小時、順流而下、則僅半小時、且　大汎續至、或竟將五六兩口中間之殘堤冲决、兩口台而爲一、則水勢將不可收拾、魯河務局長張連甲、在决河處監視、方擬從事棑柳落淤工作、正未知能否收効也、</p>
<p>蘇北大堤係</p>
<p>蘇北大堤、　徐屬視之、為西北半壁之保障、然絕不是以遏止黄流之奮運、缘是堤北起沛北之程子廟、上與魯台之舊堤相接、南迄銅北之房村、與運口閘相接近、魚台堤濱南陽口西岸、所以遏南陽湖　之西泛、是堤濱微湖西岸、所以遏微湖水之西溢、假使黄水入微、勢在奪運、誠不得已、只能任其山湖之東南岸以入運、絕不能聽其向西南岸漫溢、是以此堤之建、旨在防微水之上岸泛濫、爲豐沛簫碭銅五縣東北境之屛蔽、與黄河之改道奪運、渺不相干、運口閘與微運之聯絡上、確有關係、但是閘而非堤、在昔漕運所經、微運水勢之蒂浪、惟以一閘司其啟閉、省廳及沿運各縣、均主張修建、以此閘爲微運之關鍵、誠以運久失修、若驟下多量之水、將爲運道所不能容、有閘有壩、則可以資蘇息、同時沿運堤防、亦在趕修之中、若澈底治運、則以工程甚大、需俟諸異日、沿運各縣、固甚望省峰之早能治運、以免臨時倉惶、難於防範、周玉山趙雨蘇兩工程師、昨晨赴韓莊察看運口閘、晚車巳山韓逕返省垣、大約運口閘須俟兩工程師報吿後、省峰當有所規列整理、魯建廳爲蘇北堤及運口閘關係、前日派滕縣技師張樹椿來徐、調查切、對於建堤及修閘、似持異議、經調查後、或可釋然、</p>
<p>藺家　之視察</p>
<p>家壩在銅山北境、當張　山之南、為上通微湖之主要閘壩、緣微湖南岸、一衣帶水、通至張孤山、經張孤山南流至藺家壩、有新舊兩河、一東流、南流東折、仍滙為一、爲不老河、以入邳縣之中運、是爲銅北之幹河、銅山縣府、奉令修閘築壩、雖在銅境、而徐東西各縣、頗有連帶關係、近日各縣建設科長技術員碭山廖成章·蕭縣袁馮磐·睢寗何世梁等、均經專署調徐、以從事防黃之技術工作、各縣對　家壩之閘壩、看法不同、徐西各縣、主導水下流、以防决而倒灌、徐東各縣、主防水東下、改堤以斷其流、查微湖大堤之築、對於通銅通沛之河口、均留出涵洞、設閘以資蓄洩、幷非一例堵水、銅縣府昨召各界會議、决定山建設科長劉心源偕各代表於今晨乘汽車前往藺家壩履勘、察看形勢、再定與工辦法、大抵修壩設閘、以司啟閉、俟防黄工作完成後、再疏導不老幹河、爲預定必然之步驟、亦爲銅北水利之通盤計劃、銅山正當皖省宿縣之北、日前宿縣派丁技術員來徐、調查黄汎、對徐屬各縣及銅山之防黄設施、均表同情、徐皖科害一致、銅宿尤爲密切、决　相助進行、</p>
<p>慰　築堤民衆</p>
<p>銅山縣黨部縣政府、迭開防黄會議、巳組設防黄恊會、由各機關及建委幷士紳任委員、對於築堤民衆、表示慰勞、日前山縣黨部徵集各界贈送物品、推定代表、於令晨乘汽車赴銅北微湖沿岸、實行慰勞、縣長王公瑛、自築堤興工以來、即在微岸督工、各代表致慰後、幷視察微岸、該堤已完成大部工程、各民夫於驕陽　蒸之下、或太雨滂沱之中，不停其工作、王縣長風塵滿面、黄泥滿足、民衆呼之爲總工頸、據談、堤工可以如期吿竣、（二十五日）</p>

<h3 id="c98">日評論家　室伏高信正論　主張日本武官全部退出中國日本應避侵略中日方得接近 <a href="#c98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>昨日日文每日新聞云、現代日本著名評論家室伏高信氏、本月八日、由東京出發、視察華北各地、旋經南京訪問要路、業於二十三日來滬、二十四日、日本記者往訪於東和館、渠對中日關係、與日本對華之態度、日本國民之使命等、披瀝所見、發表如下、</p>
<p>（一）關於「新生」不敬事件　對日不敬記事、不獨中國一國、卽其他外國、亦屢見不鮮、然獨對比日本武力國力薄弱之中國、竟小題大做、實非大國民之熊度、若以些微瑣事、一一壓迫中國、則中日關係之調整、永無希望、</p>
<p>（二）對於中國之排日運動　日本釀成滿洲上海兩專變後、要求中國禁止徘日運動一節査事績以前之排日、究有何種原因、應先究明、蓋中國國民、在國情上、自古從無反抗日本之理、昔年排英運動發后、因英國政策巧妙、漸次消滅、其後漸次對日本帝國主義發生反感、於是一部分子、肆意排日、然日本苟無激昻中國國民　情之理由、雖有一部分策動全國國民、豈皆　追隨乎、</p>
<p>（三）對於蔣汪　氏之見解　世人以蔣汪二氏、認爲非絕對對權力者、出實根本的誤謬、其實蔣汪二氏、爲代表中國文武之偉大人物、</p>
<p>（四）日本對華之態度　我日本以皇道爲基礎、正在大發出之時機、然日本切不可如十九世紀之歐美列强、專採侵略主義、應正正堂堂之立論、堅守正義之、軍人須有軍人之態度、正當實踐共職、嘗有人謂、滿洲稱爲　道樂十之獨立國、但事實上果如此乎、若以滿洲爲獨立國、則討伐匪賊、應一任滿洲人之手、日本不應以維持他國之治安、犧牲自己之生命、至在中國、不假外交官之手、而用其他手段、壓迫國民政府與國民黨部、對華政策、根本上完全錯誤　余之所見、（室伏氏自稱）欲調整中日係、應將駐華日本武官、退出中國全境、不留一人、同時减少關東軍兵力十分之一、</p>
<p>（五）對於日本軍人侵犯大權之　批評　軍人應公明正大、處理直接問題、不應虛構揑造、日本軍部之人、屢有干犯大權問題、例如滿洲上海之動亂、不曰「戰爭」、而曰「事變」、因爲出變、不必經過議會之協贊、樞密院之審議、實際上所謂事變、卽戰爭也、僅就軍部單方面之意向而行、豈非侵犯大權乎、故就余之管見、專在缺乏公明的小事上着想、對於日本之前途、不堪憂慮也、</p>
<p>譯者按室伏高信氏、為日本評壇巨擘、著作宏富、熟悉中國情形、此次受東京讀賣新聞社之託、特來華視察實情、渠以犀利筆鋒、精確觀念、為全日本所崇仰、聞將遊華情形作有系統的「支那遊記」、逐日登載讀賣新聞、容該報寄到後、再行多譯、</p>

<p>司法院副院長覃振氏、應中委李石曾之邀、來滬籌備先烈黃克強紀念室、覃氏於昨晨七時一刻、由京乘夜車抵埠後、即赴滬西某大廈休息、日日社記者特往訪晤、叩以修正出版法、經立法院通過後、全國新聞界咸認新法實施、窒礙難行之處殊多、已紛電中央、請求覆議、覃氏對此之意見如何、承見告甚詳、並談及整頓全國司法諸問題、亟為分紀如次、</p>
<p>修正新出版法意見</p>
<p>覃氏首談、關於立法院所通過之修正出版法內容、本人認為法律本身、尚無多大瑕疵、惟國家法律之施行、在求乎適用、倘該法實行以後、於社會發生窒礙、則適違反立法之主旨、當然應加以酌量修改、故此間題有待研究之必要、此次中政會通過之取締出版品三項標準、本人則認為十分適當、</p>
<p>對陰私事件之見解</p>
<p>禁載個人及家庭陰私事件一節、所謂陰私云者、固無一定之範圍、但應以有關風化無須披露者為解釋、不然、將漫無限制也、將來將有一定範圍之規定、立法者無非為兼顧社會與個人之法益而設、即歐美各國、亦莫不有此類似之法律、然因風俗習慣之不同、故其所規定者亦互異耳、至報載新聞界有認為出版法幾為專對新聞事業之取締而發、未必盡然、</p>
<p>司法會議決不延期</p>
<p>至全國司法會議、已定九月十六日舉行、決定如期開幕、不致展延、所有籌備手續、大部份已告就緒、屆時各省各級法院院長、首席檢察官曁推事檢察官代表、均應赴京出席、此外全國律師協會代表、按照定章可出席六人、</p>
<p>整頓司法注重一審</p>
<p>三級三審制度實行後、各地地方法院、均感司法經費與人才之缺乏、現司法當局對此極端注意、蓋第一審關係極為重要、所有訴訟案件之事實與證據之調查、初審法院、方能盡其職責、而過去初級法院、往往因人才缺案情多之故、對判案不事認真、致第二審第三審訟案擁塞、影響甚大、此次實行三級三審制、即為注意整頓第一審而發也、</p>
<p>北上視察決定中止</p>
<p>本人自歐洲返國、原擬北上視察華北一帶司法、嗣因公務冗繁、一再延期、迄未成行、茲以司法行政部部長王用賓、已定二十七日（即今日）由京出發、北上視察平津魯豫察綏晉陜各省司法、本人現已無須前往矣、</p>
<p>籌辦黃克強紀念室</p>
<p>覃氏末稱、本人此來係應中委李石曾先生之約、因李現下榻於福開森路世界學社、該屋前為先烈黃克強氏之住宅、黃即仙逝其間、今欲就是屋闢一紀念室、以誌不朽、李先生特招余來此計議一切、並無其他任務、擬明後日即行返京云、</p>

<p>— （隱湖）</p>
<p>常在九十　　　　　　　　　的人都　避暑了。沒錢的人雖然揮着一把一把的汗，仍舊要工作，而一到空間的時候也要消暑。雖是情形不同，樂趣却是大家有的。</p>
<p>有錢的人　　到高山上，　谷風來，凉沁心脾，果然是特別的舒適。　　的人，間　　野田流水之間，柳岸微風，月明人靜，　也够人消受。</p>
<p>坐着汽車在電光照耀的大道上馳逐，或者不如扁舟一葉，容與中流，江風山月，任人消潰的好罷。</p>
<p>在金碧輝煌的大厦裏面，開着電扇，吃冰結淋，和坐在瓜棚底下，搖搖芭蕉扇，隨開惆西瓜吃吃，各有妙境。</p>
<h3 id="c142">西瓜 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 消癯</p>
<p>西瓜以雪練蝴蝶子者、爲最上品，其皮薄，而色綠沉者厥爲正宗，蓋其味甜，而水分多，入口淸凉，沁人齒頓，足以消煩暑血滌　襟，莫如此物已；當其舉刀，部食時，聲書然，而流汗四溢，清芬　鼻，　與子，黑白秩然有序，而嚼之無液滓可吐，比西瓜之最佳者也。</p>
<p>據老於種西瓜者言：第須擇種子，若種子不良，雖善爲栽植，亦無佳果；且其影響，可以波及他瓜，緃有良種，漸變劣種而後已，因西瓜藉媒介而結成，故下種時，不可不慣；第二在於壓藤大約每畝以二十潭爲率，每稞須壓藤十餘處，如是，則其根徧埋土中，而得地力始厚，一棵可結西瓜七八個，過多則瓜身不大，其間且分先後，尤以最先結者爲頭藤瓜，次則爲　藤瓜，最末爲了藤瓜，品斯下已，第三以施肥爲要，蓋以械物學言：西瓜亦屬胡盧科，其性喜培壅，種植者以省費用，有施以猪糞者，則其味必酸，若以人之糞溺，即無此弊，最講究者，有用狗屎，及鴿糞者，則北瓜露之佳，無與倫比；第四賴於天時，如去歲亢早不雨，朝夕灌溉，殊費勞力，而瓜實衆多，收穫亦整，倘雨澤不時而降，非特開花後，結實易墮，而瓜之甜者，亦不易吃着，故西瓜之年成，歲歲不同，此其大較耳。</p>
<p>就地位而言：上海西瓜，以三林塘爲最著，以前出柵，橋海源市，以及閡行，亦頗有名；唯三林塘有靑皮烏皮之別，靑皮者多雪　，烏皮者多紅黃練，有一種瓜形較小，而皮色略淡，中雜細紋，厥名洋西瓜，味甜，子色紅，而皮極薄，亦良種也；如製瓜燈，去其　，於外殻刻花紋於面，燃燭其中，懸之廊下，極爲可觀，亦夏夜消暑時不可少之淸興，故附及之，以供嗜西瓜者之一試焉。</p>
<h3 id="c143">冷飲品 <a href="#c143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>暑天，誰都愛進一些冷飲品</p>
<p>說起了冷飲，那自然沒有更比我們這個都市裹多的了。就只冰結漣一種有價格高貴到合於第一流人物口胃的，而同時，也有適宜於最下層階級中的人們的經濟能力所能應付的。自然在這最貴和圾賤之中，還分着三等九格，不拘那一等資產階級中的人，都有恰合身份的冰結漣可吃。雖然上等的冰結漣，據說每一杯中，不過附着一二千細菌，下等的冰結漣，據說每一杯中，附着三萬五萬，都不希罕，但是冰結漣的買賣，不分上等下等，都一樣的生意興隆。</p>
<p>就是刨冰，也是如此。咖啡座裹，女招待用磁盤子托着的，是賣刨冰，街頭二十大錢一盃的，也是在直賣着刨冰。再形而下的，那麽提着一只破蒲包，在弄裹直着嗓子喊「冷陰呀，賣冰呀」的，雖然所賣的，不知是磯器冰呢還是天然冰，但是他們所幹的「替人消炎解渴」的工作，則一也。</p>
<p>汽水，自然也是暑期中的恩物，可是繼汽水而興的，有鮮橘水。繼鮮橋水而興的，有礦泉水。這個有消炎却暑之功，那惆有袪熱驅煩之效，而更有人在頌揚着喝甚麽水，可補脾健胃，喝甚麽水，可却病延年。我輩眞不知前生敲破了多少木魚，今世却得　這些好味道。</p>
<p>此外，還有的「陰凉薄荷綠豆湯」，「眞正北京酸梅湯」。還有，嗯我一時想不起來了，總之，正多着呢，都是些，旣可却暑，又合衛生，更具美味的冷飲品，隨心所欲的挑着喝，檢着吃便了。</p>
<p>但是，販夫走卒們，却老是把嘴承上自來水龍頭，　嘟　嘟的如飲甘露瓊漿。若不是這些販夫走卒，對於自來水，有奇嗜的話，那麽我想這個都市裏，雖有這麼多的冷飲品，至少總還有部分人，是抱着向隅吧！</p>

<p>— 火雪明</p>
<p>睡在凉滑的竹蓆子上，還要蒸出珍珠朶兒的汗滴，如何不使淸晨起身，先向天空盹一眼？瞧藍蒼蒼的晴雲，又固定，又高遠；縱然凝着一團灰色的雲，但不久會烟似的銷沉，想到立刻拋不下一陣急雨，皮膚裏便又滲出了膩的汗質。細細兒鑒賞，即使自家的肌理並不柔嫩：其實這魔術的變幻，神奇地跳出一點又一點，倒也可以添增些兒雜興。要是天陲的一團灰色雲，愈凝愈黑，面積也愈大，為着怕熱；我的心便　進了甜香的湖風。只希望　外的楊柳枝王舞，太陽破吹滅，灰色的雲飛上樹梢，化爲淸淚，從柳眼裹瀉，綠的雨，綠的風，綠的世界；夠多和平？多未清澄？再不能撥出餘情再推想到黃河在汛濫，長江在發洪，棉苗浸爛後又將怎樣。因爲世界上的人，誰都自私得可憐。然而你能嗎—？</p>
<p>得悠悠地思維一番呀！在這世界化爲溶爐的炎暑的現在，每個人是一埭鐵，被燒得火紅。幾乎沒有一個人的身上，不在灼着苛刻的熱流，你　着我，我　着你；跳舞在　花上，歌唱在鐵錘下，被炙得無可再熱，被打得無可再暴；然而應該忍，應該笑，應該剜却自己的靈魂，你縱然再也忍不住這熱，這皆打，可是你不能逃避這溶爐。</p>
<p>另外，儘有一角的世界，確被埋葬在浩淼的冷水裏：市街上正划着漁艇，城齒沒在艇底；山尖滿踞着人，　着肚皮期待天神；孩子拉着娘的衣襟啼哭，伸出乾枯的手指，然而娘沒辦法，忍心把孩子推下山去，像一顆爛熱的蘋果，「凍」的一擊漂向波浪中；繼着自己也跌下去死了。連　棲的島，被人驚擾，也飛到熱的地方去生活。——想着，想着這一幅悲哀的「水盡，」即使你滿身火熱，你的心還不早已凍了嗎！願大家閉一閉眼，像默誦「南無阿彌陀佛」一樣；默誦民國二十年，繼大水災後而來的是些什麼歷史！</p>
<h3 id="c147">安全的海水浴 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>天氣太熱，海水浴又當令了，海水浴塲已經開放，等候着我們去消　炎然的時光。不過有幾種預防危險的方法，喜歡海水浴的人，不可不注　的；尤其是身體不甚健而年紀大的人，以及做過十分費力工作而尙未恢復缺勞的人，史應謹懈。這種人在未得充分時間的休養，或在新環境中使服水土之前，切不可貿然去作海水浴。飯後未過三小時的休息時間，也不可到海水裏去；因爲胃裏裝滿了食物而去洗浴，好比請求災禍來臨。</p>
<p>耳朵定要保　，最好用完全滴配的軟帽奔牢，或用棉花塞住；否則巨浪的力要傷害耳內鼓膜的。在高潮處洗浴，比在低潮處洗浴來得好，因爲低潮處近沙灘，而沙灘却能把從太陽光綫所得來的熱，傳給海水的。如其身上覺得寒冷，那是留在海水中時間太長的種明確的微井。在此情形中，浸水的時閒應當减少；假使選覺得寒冷，那麽海水浴要避免了。總之，海水浴不能有絲毫不舒服。不得絕對舒服，寗可不去浴海水浴，這是聰明的主意；否則所遇的刺激，恐怕要受不住。</p>
<p>在海水浴之前或後，穿了露出胸背的浴衣，行一次日光浴或戶外遝動，更有益處。假使日光强烈，祇要頭上戴頂凉帽，鼻上架副遮陽鏡。第一天橫臥在陽光射綫之下的時間，應當短些，大約五分鐘至十分鐘爲度。浴後　　　　　　　　　　　　　　，不但可除身上一切污物，而且可使血液循環增進健全。</p>
<p>海水中含有不少很有價値的監，這種　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　　水浴，受到冷水的刺激，便可增進而加速血液循環，使我們的身體更容易把污濁物從皮膚中排洩出來。而且波浪術擊我們的身體，可以得到和强有力的按摩所生的同樣效力。所以一個健全的海水浴者，愈和波浪術擊得多愈好，尤其是背心和四肢等部分。</p>
<h3 id="c148">夏之夜 <a href="#c148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— 醒生</p>
<p>在這炎熱的夏天裏，誰都感到一種苦悶的情緒。但，到了夜間，驕陽歛跡，淸風徐來，却又換了凉爽的空氣。當吾人整日價揮着汗工作以後，身子是疲乏了，精神也覺得枯燥，正需要這種凉爽的空氣來調劑調劑，所以，一到了夏天，無人不歡迎着夜的降臨。</p>
<p>夏夜，到底是可愛的，每一條馬路的邊廊，或一條弄堂裏，總可以看到一堆一堆的人在納凉，老的，幼的，男的，女的，熙熙攘攘，談笑風生。有的在引吭高歌，有的在拉胡琴，唱灘簧，有的在唱着「妹妹我愛你」，以及「小小郞兒進房來」等的淫詞艷曲，這，這或者就是他們在這可愛的夏夜裏，認爲是一種消暑納凉唯一的方法吧！然而，有心人聽了，却要生着「商女不知亡國恨，隔江猶唱後庭花」的感慨哩！</p>
<p>還有一般平時很不容易接近的靑年男女，到了夏夜，正好借着納凉的機會，與意中人談情說愛；加以單薄的衣裳，緊裏着身體，處處顯露着誘人的肉感，人是最富情慾的靈性動物，安得不爲之顚倒，於是在這夏夜裏，隨時隨地都可以發現男女們的追逐，擁抱，接吻，調笑等這一類風流的案件。</p>
<p>啊！夏夜，到底是可愛的；同時，還是一個神秘的夜咧！</p>

<p>沈李浮瓜，雖爲昔人夏季韻事，但時至今日，科學發達，論者謂以瓜果消夏，已失時代精神，衛生家尤極端忌瓜果食口，謂其易染微菌，易生蟲毒，然則炎炎長夏，將何以度？</p>
<p>啤酒淸凉而味醇，以泉水製成，且含滋養料，顧市上甚乏精良國產。雖時代士女，需要甚殷，（西方人士，四季咸飲啤酒。）但貨品之是否迎合一般人心理，價格之合否社會購買力，均在在値得注意。</p>
<p>今中國陶樂啤酒公司，將崛起於滬上，主持人李兆蕃君，爲一靑年典型商人，積多年之硏求，問世於一旦。該公司之陶樂啤酒，凡物質，價格，均能迎合一般需要，且抱犧牲宗旨，志在排廣，不在圖利，設發行所於漢口路一百十五號，比來門庭如市，實爲消夏聲中之好消息也。</p>

<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>在大都會的中流家庭，爲防食物腐敗與冷飲冷食的便利，差不多都置鎭冰箱的。可是使用冰箱，須汴意下列數點：（一）箱內冷氣，不使多洩，就是不宜時常開閉箱門，使外抓熱氣流入，溫度急　，貯藏品的出入，須非常迅速。（二）如溫熱的東西，貯藏於箱時，應用白布或薄紙，覆蓋哭皿上面，勿使因熱氣而發生的露水落在食物中，損害食物的風味，置藏新鮮鷄魚肉類，應用冰塊，壓在上面，那可保持新鮮的風味。（三）冰的用量，依食物的種類數量以及箱門開閉次數，有多有少，最初二三日內，應多放冰，其後每晨放一定的量。那末，可使內部溫度，平均保持，不會大變。（四）箱內應常乾燥淸潔，勿使潮濕，每月用開水洗滌三四次，如有　氣脂肪氣時，須用肥皂，　末泡開水冲洗。（五）箱內如有冰溶的水，急應揩拭，因爲冰水要减少冷度，且極不衛生，其排水口，須常洗濯淸潔，勿使污物積留，夾在冰上的鋸屑等，先洗凈後入箱，排水口往往爲汚物所塞，發出臭氣，且有害蟲隱伏，切宜留心，（六）箱內亞鉛皮，沾了油膩，即生鐵銹，先用鹼水洗後，再用消精揩拭。（七）普通箱內能保持　氏四十度，最適合於貯藏食物。（八）冰箱放置的地方，須避日光直射與爐灶附近，免得　熱傳道而損失冰的消費量。（九）箱內不可放入有熱氣的束四，因爲放到箱內，與箱內溫度不同，就有露水落至食物上面。（十）牛奶魚肉放在最低下層，啤酒水果，可放在上層，因爲下層溫度最低，冰的冷空氣因比重關係，自上降下的。至於冰的效用，原爲抑制細菌的繁殖，在義氏四十度時，亦不能死滅細菌，用水的量與箱的構造，關係很大，譬如用二十磅冰，能保華氏五十二度的冰箱，如冰溶至十五磅，那溫度就要昇高六十度，如溶至十磅時，溫度昇高七十度，所以箱內的冰，應當時常補給，那來，可以常保原有的溫度的。說到細菌繁殖與溫度關係如下：在一晝夜間，華氏四十度時，細菌能繁殖九粒，四十五度十三粒，五十度三十九粒，五十五度九十粒，六十度百一十粒，山此可知溫度上昇，細菌的繁殖愈快哩。</p>

<h3 id="c191">文化運動與革命運動 <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 語實</p>
<p>恰像一般玄學的唯心論者不理解革命運動與文化運動之關係一樣，一般機械的唯物論者也不理解文化運動與革命運動之關係。</p>
<p>在一般機械的唯物論者看來，文化運動與革命運動完全是兩個不可調和的對立運動。這兩運動之對立，恰像離心力和向心力之對立一樣，總是一端排斥另一端的。</p>
<p>文化運動與革命運動果眞是對立的麽？我很懷疑這種糊塗的肯定。</p>
<p>我首先要向大衆指出的，第一，就是革命運動决不是一種單純的行動可以包括盡的。克魯泡特金在其大著法國大革命史中一開首說：兩大潮流準備了並造成了法國的大革命。其一，是思想的潮流；其二，是行動的潮流。這兩個潮流匯合起來，結果就是革命。其實何止法國大革命，近代一切革命無一不是思想潮流與行動潮流匯合之結果。由此看來，反對思想文化運動不是運革命一起反對了麽？</p>
<p>第二，一切革命决不是成直綫的發展的，特別是在革命受到挫折之後，革命要想復興，非經過一個新階段的思想文化運動不可。</p>
<p>遠者不論，我們的「五四」新文化運動是怎樣有效的復興了我們的第一次革命運動，這事該還在大家記憶之中吧。假使善忘的人們，連這個歷史事實也忘記了，那就請他去翻讀一下近年的歷史罷。</p>
<p>在我看來，目前剛開始展開的思想文化運動。它不但不是反對中國革命的，它反而是爲中國未來革命作先導。在國民經過了最近六七年來的實際敎訓之後，國民不僅要求對民族現狀加以改變，國民同時也要求對自己本身加以改變—使自己本身的知識發展更能適合未來的社會運動。這是目前思想文化運動之眞意義。由此，可知思想文化運動不但不是阻止革命的，而且是未來的革命之最大的準備者和組織者。沒有牠，革命也許就這樣死了也未可知的。</p>
<p>歷史上右那一次思想文化運動不是民族覺悟之先導呢？</p>
<p>我們不能單從敎派的觀點出發把目前的文化運動看爲是某種陰謀或策略之結果，我們應從整個歷史發展出發把它看作是現時的歷史之必然要求。這是國民在較大的範圍內自覺起來改變以往的絕望的錯誤運動的表現；這是整個革命之舟駛入死港以後，國民重開革命海洋的表現；這是旁門左道的革命的煉金術士葬送了革命以後，國民企圖從全國範圍全社會範團再來復活革命生長革命的表現。</p>
<p>恰和『五四思想文化運動之復活已死的第一次革命一樣，現在的思想文化運動是有復活未來中國革命之偉大的歷史任務的。</p>
<p>已往的錯誤以及由此錯誤所生的嚴重的後果，它不僅把國民大衆弄到無所措手足的地步，甚且也把國民大衆引導到麻痺不仁的狀態。國民的心房已陷於麻痺病態，你怎能叫他的肢體給你跳舞呢？難道你能對國民大衆不用思想文化運動的啟示手段而能用玩木偶戲的手法叫他們給你跳舞麽？如我們所知，玩木偶戲者固能用其特有手法使木偶向觀者裝腔做勢，但這絕不是純眞的偉大的歷史劇，它不過是江湖藝人之逢塲作戲而已！</p>
<p>不分皂白地反對文化運動乃至反對讀書運動識字運動，這完全是一種無靈魂的舉動。這是這時代一種最悲哀最病態最暴虐最卑陋的狂妄表現。我希望這種表現趕快不再發生才好。</p>
<p>在我看來，發展目前的思想文化運動與提高國民知識水平，這不僅是爲復興中國革命所必需，並且對於這般落伍的官能萎縮的革命的煉金術士們也是非常的必需。</p>
<h3 id="c192">從著書到出書（二） <a href="#c192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— 器重</p>
<p>排版</p>
<p>走進排字房，但見一座一座的字架，像小學生排隊似的排列着，裏面有一號字二號字三號字四號字五號字六號字，正如小學校的由一年級以至六年級。其中用途最大的是五號字和六號字。這一座座的字架，上面的排列，都是依照字典的部首略有更變。我們局外人走上去，想要找一個需要的字，費了半天的光陰還是不能得到，他們工人熟的，跑東跑西的取字，一點鐘可以取到八百個左右，你看了不免要使你驚異。</p>
<p>除了這字架之外，還有一盤一盤的『標點』『符號』『空鉛』『鉛條』『鉛線』等，排列桌上，熟練工人也不必用眼睛看，只是用手取着。這是預備拚版時用的。</p>
<p>排版的第一步工作是『檢字』（他們工塲中呌做『撖毛坯』），由一種專門檢字的工人，依照了原稿上批明的幾號字，將所需的字從字架上取下來照預定每行的字數一個個放在字匣裏。假使這一個字恰好字架上沒有，或是一時找不到，那就用一個空鉛或是墨片放在那裏，或是用別的字倒放或是側放着。以備校對後再行改正。檢字的工人把字檢好了，於是由另一個工人將所檢之字一一加起標點符號來，把鉛條鉛線嵌進去，使其成爲預定的版口一樣大。這是叫做拚版。版拚好後，於是送上打樣架打出一張樣子，送交校對的人去依了原稿校對。</p>
<p>在這裹，我再說一下機器的排字：前面我所說的是中文的排字，至於排西文，因爲西文只是少數的字母，所以用手工排的，不要像排中文樣檢字工人東奔西跑，他們是可以坐了工作的。至於用機器排，是像打字機樣打的，你一面把原文打字機樣打着，一面就有一個個鑄成的新的鉛字跳出來爲你排好在字盒中了。所以這種排字的機器，他們不要預先鑄鉛字，一個個都是臨時鑄成的。有人想用這方法發明一架排中文字的機器，畢竟因中國字不是拚音字，字數太多而沒法發明，可見中國的漢字，却有改良之必要了。</p>
<p>校對</p>
<p>第一步的校對呌做「毛校」，通常是由排字房裹擔任的。這毛校，不過是將樣子上缺着的字校出來，使樣子上不要成爲滿是黑點。至於式樣等等，那是他們不管的。這種毛校的工作，</p>
<p>讀者，你將說校對不過是改正錯字，這工作是很容易的罷。然而，讀者，你若如是想，那可錯了；因爲校樣是不大淸楚的，每易使人頭昏眼花，我們看印得很淸楚的書，常常會內中有一個錯字隨眼看過而不覺得，那看着滿子錯字的校樣，怎不要令人頭昏眼花！如果一個印刷局中，並沒有「拔丁子」的毛校先生，那校對者當然更苦痛不堪了！</p>
<p>普通校稿大都校三次，第一次呌做初校，校對者展開校樣，照了原稿一個一個字看下去，有錯的字爲之改正，有多的字爲之刪去，有脫漏的再爲之補上。同時，還要注意到格式和版口。這一次的校對最爲痛苦，因爲錯字很多，每易頭昏眼花。校對好了，將校樣再送印刷局去，印刷局呂爲之一一更正，再打一份樣子送來校對，這呌個二校·二校比較運淸爽多了，雖然中間還不免有「丁子」和錯字，但不像初校時那樣一團糟，所以校對也比較容易。不過校對者不譜校對技衛，所用改正的符號，不能使工人懂得，那你校你的，他改他的，結果弄得還是一團糟，仍與初校未校時一樣。仍舊令人要頭昏腦腲。二校校好了再送印刷局去，改正了送來再校的呌做三校。校得好的，三校大都沒有什麽錯字，就可以簽字了。不過，在二校時失眼而未校出者，仍不妨加以改正。所以三校的人員的責任很大。可是，三校失眼而還沒有看出的錯字，你已簽字而打紙版了，那就沒法校正，只好待紙版打出之後，在紙版上挖改了。然而，紙版上偶改一字還不打緊，多改了就麻煩了；因爲改紙版，有一個字算一個字的改費的。至於格式，那是紙版上沒法改的。所以三校之人，責任眞是重大！</p>
<p>製型</p>
<p>稿子已經校好，於是就以鉛字去打紙版。這叫做「製型」。製型是預備印書以前的一件重要工作，因爲用活字排成的版子，犬批送上機器去印刷，是很不方便的；而且這許多鉛字放在機器上印行，排字房裏要感到周轉不靈，工作不免要發生影響；再有，鉛字因印書而受機器重壓，鉛字自然也要損壞，不久就字面模糊，不能再用，成了一堆廢鉛，須得回爐鎔化，重鑄新字，豈不損失很大！還有，化了不少的心血，排成的版子，印成了初版新書，將來要再版了，如果沒有紙型，必須從新再行排了，再行校對，這不僅費時，而且也費錢，所以打成紙型，到再版時只須把紙型檢出來澆成鉛版就得，豈不一舉數得！所以，把排成之版打紙型，是必不可少的一種步驟。（未完）</p>

<p>『化學奇談』，顧均正譯，法布爾著。</p>
<p>開明出版　定價九角</p>
<p>我們的敎育界大多　在死書裹，先生依書本像留聲機般的講述，學生依樣書葫蘆把他收了音來，這就呌做好學生。可是這好學生假使把他送進一個實騐的地方，他就不知所措了。這是因爲敎育方面還沒有把學和用打成一片的緣故，尤其是理科方面。要解决這個因難，我要鄭重的介紹一本『化學奇談』給我們的讀者。</p>
<p>人家都說化學是一門枯燥艱　的科目，可是在化學奇談裹却給每個讀者以很豐富的興趣，作者由可愛的愛彌兒，裘爾斯向他們的叔父保羅的有趣對話，寫出神秘的化學來。我們一見到保羅叔懇切新奇和愛的熊度，這本書就會使我們感到硏究的興趣，當然，法布爾要是沒有文學的修養，他是不能寫出這本書來的。</p>
<p>例如第三章他說到碳，他不從碳說起，而從一塊烘焦的麵包脫到薇來，這是多慶引人　味呀！</p>
<p>又像他說郅化合的意義，他說：</p>
<p>『硫黃和鐵結婚後所變成的什麽東西，我們不能稱他爲硫黃，因爲牠不復是硫黃了；我們也不能稱牠爲鐵，因爲牠不復是鐵了，我們也不能脫牠是爲硫黃和鐵的混合物，因爲牠起初雖然是混合物，但後來已不是復是混合物了。這東西在化學上稱爲硫化鐵，從這一個名詞，使我們想起這兩種物質是受了化學婚姻的約束而結合起來的。』</p>
<p>他把化合稱爲結婚，這醫喩是最切合沒有了，他又把化合作用時所生的熱，光，爆發，炸裂，火花等，　　做祝賀他們結婚的爆竹和燈彩，這不是很令人玩味嗎？</p>
<p>葉紹鈞先生在這書序裹說得最透切：</p>
<p>『這本化學奇談雖然也是一本書，但不是叫人讀的書，也不是叫人『記憶』的書，原著者法布請很巧妙的筆把「賦」字的工夫曲曲描寫出來，使讀者不個具有化學的知識，並且能作化學的實騐，同時又增進了試的能力。可用以對付別的事物。「化學」。這名詞寫在課程表裏多少枯燥乏味，但在這本書裹差不多是最動人的故事了。『我也能像　爾斯愛彌兒那樣做的呀！讀者將這樣想，又因實騐的設備是」俯拾即是」的，或者是自製的，讀者將馬上「自己動手」照書上所說的做。更自出心裁地做。</p>
<p>『誰僅僅「讀」或「記憶」這本書，誰就辜負了這本書。』</p>
<p>需要智職的靑年朋友，記着這句話，來讀這本有趣的書吧</p>
<p>編者按自然科學的書物所以在我國不甚爲人所歡迎，其最大的原因，即是由於枯燥乏味，不僅是學理，最主要的還是文字，故欲使自然科學的知識普及於國民大衆，我們不可不把這種說理的文字，加以趣味化，文藝化。這就需要文字體裁的改革，編者敢在這裏提出這個問題，希望能引起大衆的討論。</p>

<p>性神經衰弱　植物之灌溉在於肥料，人體之培養在於滋養品，生殖器之不發育，亦此中之一者也。究其原，胥皆歸罪於父母。人在孩童時期，責任負之於家長。本來孩童除營養及消化注意外，生理上健康定可完美，發育完全不成問題。所可惜者，處幼至成年，家長不加注意，聽其自然，致造成習慣性之惡習。青年失志者，不知凡幾。倘事前注意，究其有無病癥，生理上有無變化，應卽分別清楚，早期糾正，庶可保持幸福。今觀意志薄弱之青年，身體素甚健康，而於發育時期妄加非動，身體旣日形瘦削，終成神經衰弱，如記憶力不強，生殖器短小，及一切性機能衰退之現象立現。治療本癥時，除使用藥物的治療外，施使電械，實為不可或缺乏輔助。</p>

<p>濕疹好發之部位。十九在關節陰處。如大腿內側。陰囊左右固圍及上腦內側等。間有散在四肢者。</p>
<p>本癥發生時。通常先覺皮膚瘙癢。灼熱。腫起。次發生帽針頭大之邱疹。漸變焉水泡。也有例外。或破潰。或結軟痂。頑固難治。</p>
<p>致發本癥之原因。大都為皮胦不潔。寄生菌。腺病性惡心液質及血行障礙等。然也亦由於化學。溫熱及器械的刺戟如苦力勞作者最易罹斯疾。也有由於貧血。萎黃病及糖尿病者。但甚罕見。</p>
<p>治療本癥。大都着重局所療注。全身狀態亦須注意。局所療法。最忌用酒精配合之液體藥。因其有刺激表皮剝離之部分。不但無效。反而有害。此時最好用軟膏劑或油劑。法租界八仙橋中法學堂隔壁卽敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號仁壽西藥社經售之滅絕菌MIDULZINE係用最化學製劑。凡撲滅皮膚細菌。助長皮膚抵力之藥物。此藥配合俱全。各種癬患。用之有效。殊不知對於濕疹。尤能迅速奏功。其他各種之皮膚疾患。施搽此藥。均收良果。</p>

<p>有鴉片癮者，其體內必含有抗雅片毒及中和鴉片毒之素質。此素質乃因鴉片之習慣作用而來，因抵抗及分解鴉片毒素而產生。旣具有此素質後，非及不可。在醫學上謂之鴉片慢性中毒，卽俗謂成癮。戒煙之意義，就是排除此種素質之手段。此素質旣除，原與常人無異。從前是被動的遞減，現在是自然的消滅。戒時的痛苦和愉快，戒期的冗長和短促，可以不必權衡而知之。用血清戒煙痛苦旣無，戒期又短，且永不反癮。煙癮之大小，成癮之年數，或因病上癮，身體孱弱，均無足阻礙於戒煙。若同時施以蛋黃素福司福爾命來豈丁及福爾賜保命等營養劑，則愉快神情，不亞吸時。</p>

<p>（一）潛伏期之診辦　於患者之尿道內。子宮外口部。或腔內。用白金銀線。採取其分泌物。以之製塗抹標本。染色後。鏡檢之。得發現病原菌。多數之上皮細胞。</p>
<p>（二）前驅期之診斷　由前述之方法。鏡檢由各部所採取之塗抹標本。由尿道受者。得發現病原菌。上皮細胞。及少量之粘液。由性器管者即子宮口及腔部所採者。大致亦相同。但其病原菌之數較多。</p>
<p>（三）膿漏期之診斷　當此期外尿道口及腔內。肉眼上卽能見多量膿汁。鏡檢之。在尿道口之上皮細胞。得以知其為本病。僅為尿道淋時。用二杯法。前尿混濁。後尿證明。起膀胱炎。賢盂炎。賢臟炎者。用二三四杯法。其各杯之尿。均呈混濁。</p>

<p>— 崔馥卿</p>
<p>淋病通稱為白濁，在花柳病中，要占十分之六七，究其來由，係男女交媾之不潔，涉足花叢而來，是為普通人所共知，為一種淋毒球菌，侵襲於男子尿道黏膜上，或女子子宮頸部，且其繁殖力極強，能在最短時間，發生泌尿器妨礙，初感尿道灼熱，排便刺痛，小便混濁不清，組織腫脹，分秘一種膿樣之汁，更甚則出血，體溫頗高，此謂之急性淋病，若不加之適當治療，淋毒菌則侵入尿道深部，成為慢性淋病，表面上雖有和緩之現象，分秘疼痛減輕，實際則病根日深，毒菌潛伏尿道深部，非藥力一時可能殺滅，則成為終身之害，更則有絕嗣及殺身之禍，試觀現今一般醫家，對於淋疾治療藥品，多數應用黃色素靜脈注射，或用蛋白銀及利佛羅爾溶液　RERGON.　ARGNON.　HEGONON等悄道洗滌，其效果亦有收相當之成績不過收效時間緩，對於除根一層，尚有疑問，而黃色素注射，普通用〇·五％溶液每次注射　10.CC至20CC，常有因患者體質，而發生嘔吐及中毒癥狀，若注射急速，則招劇烈之急性中毒，危險者多，不可不考慮之，近年來醫藥，特飛猛進，日新月異，漸趨精美，實以科學倡朋之故，例如現今法租界寗波路六十六號春在醫院所用之短波電療，及法租界八仙橋敏體尼蔭路老德行里一號，仁壽西藥社所經售之MESALTROPIN（減殺淋片）專治男女急慢性淋疾，及一切由淋濁引起之疾患，尤為特效，此外尚有德國滿爾志洋行最新出品，淋毒舒樂耳GONO—SEROL血清，為治療淋毒尿道炎之特效藥，應用簡單，而無痛苦，注入尿道內，而能達於黏膜之皺裂，及微細之裂隙間，使表面與深部之菌淋，可同時殺滅，除治療外兼有預防白燭之功。</p>

<p>戒過一次</p>
<p>余染　十餘年，游戲上癮，並無疾患，民十八年冬曾戒過一次，醫生為余注射及日給內服藥水，經過一旬頗舒適，迨後則手足酸軟，泄瀉等相繼襲來，致又中止，貴刋服務社會，誠意可欽，祈介紹良醫，俾得脫離所苦（吳祥雲君問）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3 id="c201">窮人的醫病問題 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>頃閱報載南京電：市黨部函市府，本京醫生，對於市府所定標準，多有陽奉陰違，增索診金者，請嚴加取締，請飭衛生事務所，隨時調查，如有不遵守診金標準，任意超過原定數目收費者，應卽從嚴取締，這真是一件功德無量的事。</p>
<p>一個人的生活費，除衣食住等必需開消外，醫藥費也是不能缺少的。肚子餓沒得飯吃難過，身體失和沒有服藥，其痛苦更不堪言。常人云，天有不測風雲，人有旦夕禍福。體魄強健的還可以，身體衰弱的，時時就要受疾病的侵襲。醫藥費的重要，於此可知。</p>
<p>然看藥服藥，又豈是容易嗎？這裏所說的不容易，自然是指大多數窮人而言。有錢人無病也有補藥吃，當作別論。其他地方或許情形好一點，上海醫藥費的昂貴，簡直叫人不敢問津。掛着博士或名醫招牌的不消說，他們的主顧不會是窮人。卽一般普通醫生，診費也多至三兩塊，少的一塊。再加上藥資，你想請一位到家裏來看，出診費比門診費得高上三五倍，還要花若干車馬費。有時醫生認為必要，給你打這麼一兩針，費用就些擔不起。</p>
<p>但疾病是每個人都無法避免的，這真要命。許多窮人因為有病看不起醫生，只好用自己的肉體，去同病魔掙扎。掙扎得過算是僥倖，抵抗不住正是你的命運該休。</p>
<p>不過上海也有一些慈善機關附設的貧民施診所，不但看醫生免費，藥也發給。委實加惠貧民不淺，惟據說這種施診所，類多設備不周，看病也很隨便。致有人卽使患病，亦不願意去請教。這實有充分改良的必要。須知慈善事業，也要辦到一個相當的程度。我們並不能因為免費施診，便馬虎從事。我們希望市當局，能在上海多建設幾處貧民醫院，完全免費施診給藥，這倒是一種很好的社會事業。</p>
<h3 id="c202">哲學家 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 克明</p>
<p>——令人物行述</p>
<p>在熱鬧區的大街上，在大都會的陰暗的一角，在下等宿店的沿街的窗口，甚至在赤裸裸的人行道上，張起一間狹小得可怕的門面，題上了「居士」或「客「等的雅號，在門外，雜亂地張掛着宋洪武，黎元洪，以及中國偉人孫中山的肖像，附着滿綴着朱紅圈點與詳批的命書，神秘得莫名其妙的干支的排列與江湖訣的術語，掛着招牌：「哲學家　　山人命相館」；於是，在另一塊牌子上，看到的是「哲學家」服務的代價了：「談相半元，批命一元……」，此外，剩下來的，便該提起那標着「科學哲理命相」的「哲學家」了。</p>
<p>正和一切殘餘在仕宦社會中的江湖識字份子一樣，一件長衣服在他們是非常重要的；靠了它，他們便可對「平民百姓」們區別起來，自己把自己放到比一些勞働人們更高的地位上去，把自己拼命地擠進「讀書人」的堆裏去，把自己擠進「來往客商，高尚仕女」的圈子裏去。</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>。</p>
<p>是的，從那兒，他們扮着「墨客」的人物，利用着這一天比一天凋敝的世界裏的困難，利用着在宿命論中長成的小市民的心理，他們，在「居士」，「山人」，「哲學家」等這一些銜頭中，像一片腐爛了的葉子上的寄生虫一樣，喘息着，寫劃着，一天比一天更沒有把握地活下去。</p>
<p>可是，據說，「哲學家」，小的時候也會在私塾裏，在小學或中學裏唸過書呢。跟着老先生唸四書，唸易經，唸左傳；讀書人，也是「讀書人」啊！可是，長大來，靠看空洞的「字目」，經商是幹不來的，切實的技能是沒有的；浪着，飄着；好在這古國的人民全是相信着靠天吃飯，與靠命運過日子的，這一條路也許是走得通的啊。於是，先得化上百來日的功夫，「做」得一手彷彿是「龍飛鳳舞」的字，弄熟了「甲乙丙丁」，摸通了江湖訣，化起本錢，場面鋪起了，於是，人坐在裏面，等候着宿命論的信徒：失意的，艱難的，疑慮與彷徨的，在這時代的衰敗的必然性中迷失了理智的…於是，訊問着，「指點」着，這時候，「機警」的天才是需要的，「察言辯色」的技巧也是需要的。「哲學家」同時也得是「心理學家」，用了這樣的「才能」，向那些懦弱的宿命論者勸誘着，恫嚇着：企圖在他人底求安與免事的心理中得到一些更大的利潤，他們活下去，活下去。</p>
<p>然而，年世是真的不行了，這一門生意却也難做啊，得應付同業的競爭，得想點新奇的幌子：近來，卽使對一個宿命論的虔誠的信徒罷，那怪形怪狀的朱洪武的肖像與他的「真命天子」的「八字」，也不再有吸引力了——日來，一切都要講新法子呀，於是，當人家掛起「一等文學博士」的招牌來時，自己也得想個「哲學家」與「科學推命家」來混混看了。但是，不管有着那麼多的巧計，近來生意難做是真的：人縱然想知道命裏註定幾時發財，然而這幾角錢的代價却也儘夠打算一下了呢。這世界，錢是頂真的呀。</p>
<p>為了這，現在的我們的「哲學家」也得打算一下，而打起「跑狗票必勝法」，「航空獎券購買法」來抓取另外一羣的顧客，另外一羣的人了。</p>
<p>可是，頂叫「哲學家」想不懂的是：「也是讀書人呀，連飯都沒有好好地吃呢。」</p>
<p>這是連「哲學家」也不懂的「哲學」！</p>

<h3 id="c204">望雲小感 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 陳田舍</p>
<p>我愛雲，夏天是多雲的季節，我愛望雲的幻變，夏天傍晚的雲是幻變得格外玄妙而迅疾，每片雲的每個姿態不會保持到半個分碼的。郊外寫生者當他要描寫一幅夏天傍晚的野空的時候，要用多麼靈敏的視覺和迅疾的筆法呵，而且，夏晚的雲霓的色調是非常複雜的，說不定有時候色調板會被難住以人工的色調去適應自然的幻變，卽使是超越的藝術家，而偶然的棘手仍免不了吧！</p>
<p>兒時在鄉間，夏天傍晚洗了身子，輕快地穿着米色粗夏布領衣和短褲，套着小木屐兒，坐在場上矮竹凳上，媽在半邊剝青豆。凉風是那棵老桂楊樹頂上抖下來的，帶着樹葉的青氣。我幽閑地捏着柄並不需要的蒲扇，望着天空，望着天空的片片浮雲，憑着自己的相像，會把那些雲片看成各種各樣的人或動物。出神的時候，便嚷了出來：「媽，那邊不是一輛牛車嗎！」</p>
<p>逢到媽高興，也抬起頭來望，晚霞的光彩照着她平滑的額角，眼睛是　青的，裏面也有雲片在流動，那時媽還在壯年時代。當我指着一片雲，拖着她的胳臂，頭傾倚在她肩膊上，和她糾纏的時候，她會假裝憤怒的說：「我看你要變痴子了。」而結果，總是那樣慈和地笑了起來，這在我是懂得的，我依舊要和她糾纏：「媽，那邊不是一個挑擔兒的老太婆嗎。」指着天空。</p>
<p>可是，媽媽就在雲兒的飄流中漸漸地衰老了，如今，她不會在我身邊說：「雲是山谷中放出來的，有仙人仍把它收進山谷去。」這類神話。她仍擁着一個多病的身子隱息在遙遠的近海的故鄉，而我却被生活的狂風吹到這都市裏來，許多兒時的脾氣完全絡續在生活途中失落了，境遇也正如夏晚的浮雲那般地，連叫人去體味一些時候的機會都沒有，一些都沒有……</p>
<p>「薄倖的浮雲呵，薄倖的年華！」</p>
<p>每一想到，便會這樣嘆息起來，尤其是在這夏天的傍晚，捲起小樓的簾子，讓白天奔波下來的疲乏的身子斜倚在窗欞上，含着一支賤價的烟捲，在苦淡的境味中，仰望着天空雲片的流蕩，至今還祗有這望雲的興緻沒有减去，我想從雲霓上反映出自己漂泊的人生，可是，我的屋子太低了，在都市裏，不容易獲得一塊寬朗的天空，生活在都市裏的人也不容易有一個豁達的胸襟，於是，明亮的陽光一來就被雲霓遮掩而眼前感到一片陰晦。</p>
<p>「那片灰雲是不是從故鄉的海空飄流來的呢？是不是也經過我年老的媽媽的頭頂上呢？…我媽媽有沒有仰起脖子望過，而知道那片雲要飄流到幾千里外的兒子的眼前來呢？」……</p>
<p>常常這樣在自己的腦神經裏反詰着。</p>
<p>烟捲味更覺的苦淡了。我覺得人生每個境遇的段落，正和雲的流散幻變一樣，永遠不再會恢復原狀的。誰都不能預料那片牡丹形的浮雲會變成怎樣的形態為止，嘆息亦是無用的，總還得防着驟然而來的巨風。</p>
<h3 id="c205">夜奔 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 吉彖</p>
<p>那一天，從黃昏起，天就就開始陰沉沉地把黑雲鋪起，接着是可怕的雷電，最後，一陣必然的，不可避免的大雨便像倒一般地落下了。</p>
<p>大雨不住地下，打在小屋的鐵皮頂上，急促得像戰場上的鼓，把人底心情攪得像混水一樣的打起旋來了。望着天空，雨依舊不住地在下，好像立誓非把稽留在空中已經好久了的水分全盤一滴不剩地傾下來不可；已經是深夜了啊，雨依然沒有一點兒止意。然而在我，這好像已經是沒有關係的事情了；為了生活，這深夜，我必需立刻投向雨水淋漓的門外去，投向幾百里路以外的都會中去；一切留戀着，離不開的，在生活的找尋下已經完全粉碎：我得冒着夜的黑暗，夜的雨水，投身奔向外面去了。</p>
<p>妻為我祝了福，為我理好了行裝，為我披上雨衣，為我把手燈照亮了幽暗的甬道，為我開了門，為我用笑與眼淚來囑託珍重；而我，一定的，我得絕不遲疑地奔向夜之大地去。</p>
<p>（也不用再說愛戀與感情等等的名詞吧：我們都年輕——是的。然而近一二年來從生活的困苦中所受到的教養難道還不夠嗎？人是不應當有感情的——人為什麼要有它呢？人要是沒有感情，他該是多麼幸福的呢…）</p>
<p>為了年輕的時候（然而，難道現在已經是年老了嗎？），大家有一對眼睛與一條靈魂，而當發現了這世界是不十分適宜於有眼睛與有靈魂者所居住的當兒，我們都在生活的面前使了孩子氣，會橫過一橫心，便毅然地擺脫了難受的世界底嘴臉，固執地走到這簡樸的地方來，打算用自己的勞力與熱情來當作肥料，把這卽使是簡單的生活灌溉起來——不一定要成功茂盛的大樹，就是頂細的嫩芽，也就滿足的了。</p>
<p>然而，「是個多傻的想頭呢？」這時代的人，他們是十分地關心着生活，而並不把注意放在這以外的地方的呀（在生活的圈子中，他們是精細，靈敏，狡獪而能幹的；而在生活的圈子以外他們是傻子與愚昧者啊，他們是……）。於是，日子一天天地走下去，生活一天天地難起來；到這時，世界懂得了人，人也懂得這世界了。</p>
<p>但，生活的意思就是「要吃」，而不僅是柳花式的浮絮啊！——這一些日子裏，為了生活，兩個年青人已經磨折得足夠；到不再有機會讓你記得世界之醜惡的當兒，人已經躅躑在飢餓的邊綫上，什麼都不再想到了。</p>
<p>於是明白：又應該是着急的時候了。已經不再是頂小的孩子，畏懼着外面的世界，卽使是沒有罪惡，然而却是危險的——生活從來不與人打謊或說玩話的，他是扳着臉來對付人的啊！</p>
<p>這樣一來，所留戀的，除了以後的日子以外，還有什麼呢——可怕也好，醜惡也好，難受的離情的煎熬也好，生活要求你浪出去，人是不能（或者說，也不應當）反抗的，是的！</p>
<p>學到沒有感覺，在我想來，也許是不難的吧？而據說沒有感覺又往往是幸福的。那末，夜也好，大雨也好，家人的別離的眼淚也好，這一切有什麼關係呢？夜是無邊地鋪在外面，雨依舊沒有停止，路是黑而泥濘，而我，則終於冒着雨水，冒着夜，悠遠地奔出去了。</p>

<p>— 容</p>
<p>素從吳淞來信說：「來吧，雖然你們在一百零一度的熱波中喘息着，但是在這裏，是和你過着兩個季節的，夏是個盛裝的少婦，你為什麼失去和她親暱的機會？我們這裏有蟬聲，日光，和碧青的海水，入夜更有半圓的月亮，來吧，來吧！</p>
<p>因了那橋的魅力，便帶了一些輕便的小行李，被小蒸汽車帶到吳淞。</p>
<p>海濱的風物都是極饒詩趣的，我和素走在細碎砂石的小徑上，茂草拂着我的衣，上面是終古不動的藍色的天，遠處是蒼茫無際的翻著細浪的海，天海交界處，幾頁白帆在微風中懶洋洋地前進，晚霞一抹紫，美極了，在那反射過來的光綫中，什麼屋宇，道路，樹葉，人畜，都帶上一層奇麗的令人神往的金色。我凝心是自己走進荷蘭派畫家的迷離情調的風景畫裏。</p>
<p>入晚，大家便在海岸上徘徊，看着天色那麼可愛地（不是可怖地）黑了下來，海波，岸，岸上的人，都迷失在那濛濛的夜霧裏。沿着石板砌成的蛇一樣的長堤，帶着微含一點希望的心情，數着那石板靜，走過了，如一個神話裏的英雄，向不可知的境地去搜索那為魔思所守護的寶貝。海水是不問晝夜地在翻騰，在嚙着堤脚的亂石，奏着銅鈸鼓鐃樣的妙樂。靜坐在長堤的盡端，聽脚底洶湧着的無盡的波濤，看繁星在七月天明潔的天空中燿燿，隱現，與隕落，我好像在誦讀一個用宇寅萬象所譜出的和諧的詩章。海風從氣象臺那一帶緩緩吹來，夾帶着不知什麼人唱出的歌聲，我側着頭靜靜傾聽，愈聽愈覺得心醉，那凄婉的音調幾乎和當前的景物打成一片，等到那歌聲停住而轉過頭來時，不知在什麼時候我們已經被朦朧的月光包圍住了</p>
<p>在這樣月白風清的良夜，坐在這麼一個人跡不到的僻靜的海隅，聽着連人的歌曲，都不說話，我們疑心自己是做着悠古而神奇的夢！</p>
<p>夢中，包羅千萬人的大上海在向天空吐着把毒蛇似的烈燄，那一角的天宇整個是紅的，紅光籠罩下，有無數的人是在歌着，哭着，享着樂，犯着罪，受着苦痛，懷著希望——一個永恒的生命掙扎之不斷的持續……</p>
<p>把我們幻想冲散的，是一隻碩大無比的汽船，像巨獣那樣從海口衝過來，冒着烟，烟和夜霧裊在一起，看得見的只有滿船的燈火，只一停，便聽到怒吼一樣的沉重的拋錨聲，聲音像震動了周圍的一切，一刹那間，又復歸於靜寂。我們的幻想又隨着海波的溫柔的號召而復甦起來。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Lu Province Government Makes Every Effort to Actively Handle Flood Control and Disaster Relief. Reception Centers are Established in Various Counties Along the Jinpu and Jiaoji Railways. Five Million Disaster Victims Are Being Transported in Succession. Provincial Government Meeting Passes the Establishment of the Flood Control Project Office. <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan) The Provincial Government is now making every effort to actively handle flood control and disaster relief. In addition to ordering the establishment of reception centers in various counties along the Jinpu Railway, it has now also ordered their establishment in various counties along the Jiaoji Railway. Governor Han personally instructed the county magistrates to have a compassionate heart, fulfilling the desire to relieve the hungry and rescue the drowning. Five million disaster victims are currently being transported in succession, with over 20,000 people already transported. The Governor has ordered Provincial Committee member Zhang Yue to inspect the various reception centers. He telegraphed Gu Chenglu of the Railway Department to transport disaster relief grain free of charge. Today, the Provincial Government Meeting passed the establishment of the Flood Control Project Office, with Construction Department Head Zhang Honglie as the director and River Bureau Head Zhang Lianjia as the deputy. The light railway from Guantai and Lanfeng to Dongbatou is to be retained according to a telegram from the River Bureau to Kong Xiangrong, so as to provide materials for future flood control. Song Zheyuan donated 3,000 yuan for disaster relief. The losses of fields, crops, houses, and livestock in Yuncheng County alone have been statistically determined to reach 8 million yuan. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Jinning Canal breached, and the water is very strong, flowing north and only two li away from the Jinning Station. The situation is critical. The stationed troops and students from various local schools are urgently cutting reeds from Nanyang Lake to block the water and facilitate the discharge of lake water. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The Yellow River's three branches are all rising today. The water level at Luokou is 28.9 meters. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The canal southeast of Jinning breached, and the situation is serious.

<h3 id="e2">The Water Level of Weishan Lake is Stable <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Huaiyin) According to news from the Huaipi Section Engineering Office, after the floodwaters in Xiazhen receded, the water in Weishan Lake, which had increased due to heavy rains in western Shandong, also dropped by three sheng on the 25th, with only 31,173 meters of water remaining. The floodwaters in various flood control areas such as Pisu and Qing'an have also fallen sharply. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Copper Construction Committee and representatives from all walks of life went to Lanjia Dike in the morning for inspection and returned to Xuzhou that evening. It was determined that the dike site was located at the breach on the south bank of Weishan Lake, which is extremely important. It was resolved to submit a report to the province to build a solid stone dike at that location for flood protection and to install a large sluice gate to facilitate storage and discharge. Various sectors in Xuzhou formed a comfort delegation and raised a large amount of supplies. Today, they went to the construction site of the dike on the northern shore of Weishan Lake in Tongshan to comfort the dike-building workers. (Special dispatch from the 25th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) A dispatch from Pei County stated that the Yellow River Prevention Association received a report from the water monitoring post in Yanggutun on the eastern shore of Weishan Lake stating that the lake water level rose by one meter yesterday afternoon. Three li of the upper beach overflowed the old three-way border dikes, and the water flowed in from the northeast bank of the lake. It was confirmed that Nanyang Lake had overflowed. However, the water color was still clear. It is not yet known whether there is a large torrent upstream. Commissioner Shao has urgently telegraphed all counties to step up their vigilance. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Commissioner Shao Hanyuan telegraphed County Magistrate Wang on the night of the 25th, stating that Weishan Lake had risen sharply by about one meter, and the northeast of Pei County had exceeded the three-way border. He ordered him to immediately supervise the dike construction day and night to start construction before dawn to avoid delays. Another telegram was sent to Xuzhou on the 26th, stating that the water level of Weishan Lake was continuing to rise as of the 26th. It had already submerged about three li of the lake shore. Commissioner Shao personally inspected the dike construction and encouraged the people to speed up construction, requiring completion within one week, day and night. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 26th)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Zhou Yushan returned to the provincial capital and said that if the water level does not rise further, northern Jiangsu can be protected. In addition, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, worried that the breach of the Yellow River in Shandong has not been blocked and the water is flowing south, threatening northern Jiangsu, has specially ordered the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau to rush to build water barriers upstream of the Huiji Sluice and in the middle reaches of the Liu Lao Jian River to prepare for the worst.

<h3 id="e3">The Yongding River Shows No Rise or Fall <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The water level of the Yongding River was stable on the 26th. It had risen sharply by about one foot on the night of the 25th and then fell in the morning. The Maritime Customs Bureau is still closely monitoring the downstream situation. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The water level of the Yongding River rose sharply by one foot yesterday due to heavy rain the night before, reaching a water level of one zhang. Today, the weather cleared, and the water level dropped again by one foot. The current water level is still the same as the day before, calculated to be nine feet. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The North China Water Conservancy Commission telegraphed the Hebei Provincial Government on the 26th, explaining that the Yongding River has established a South Dike Defense Committee and is not likely to be in danger. Even if the Zhonghong in the Sanjiao Lake overflows, it is not likely to cause a disaster because of the South Dike's protection. If the South Dike is not maintained, there are still No. 22 House's Rolling Water Dike and Control Gate that can settle sediment, preventing the Hai River from silting up. The Zhonghong overflowed in Shuangkou Town last year, but Tianjin did not experience a disaster. Therefore, the danger this time is not in the Yongding River but in the South Canal. On the 26th, the Yongding River water level was 6.8 meters in the morning. According to the North China Water Conservancy Commission, the water level has fallen. The highest water level rose to 6.3 meters, which would cause an overflow, but it is still far from the danger period. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Tianjin River Defense Committee held a meeting on the 26th, and all members attended. Specific flood control measures were decided. In the afternoon of the 26th, there was rain to the north of Tianjin, but there was still a possibility of rain. Generally, there is considerable concern about flood control and the rise and fall of various rivers, fearing disaster. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Municipal Government allocated 20,000 yuan to the Public Works Bureau on the 26th as flood prevention funds for the city's rivers. The bureau sent section chief Chen Yanzhong and others to form a fund management committee. On the 26th, the bureau's flood prevention and emergency repair plan was drawn up, and it immediately transported soil to repair the dikes of various regiments and the suburban river dikes. Liu Zhiwei was appointed as the captain of the various river flood prevention teams to supervise the staff in flood prevention. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) According to a telephone call from Baoding, there was heavy rain for two days, and the weather cleared by noon on the 26th.

<p>(Tianjin) There was heavy rain in Changli. The water near Beining Station accumulated to several feet. As of around the 26th, the Luan River water level had risen by a total of one zhang. The Beining Railway Bridge is in danger due to the scouring of the waves. Trains are running slowly, and the railway bureau has allocated additional workers to cooperate with the police to guard it. Luan County is a vast expanse of water inside and outside the city, with the floodwaters connected to the river water. Shops and residents have moved to higher ground. A large amount of grain and stone accumulated on both sides of the Luan River was washed away by the water because it could not be transported in time. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to people from Yuguan, there has been continuous heavy rain in the counties west of Yuguan. Farmland in low-lying areas in counties such as Changli has been flooded.

The water outside the city is eight feet high, and residents are moving to higher ground or rooftops. The fields and gardens in the four suburbs are a vast expanse of water. Other counties under the jurisdiction of Chaozhou have also experienced severe flooding, and the losses to fields and gardens are extremely heavy. (Special dispatch from the 26th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The Yutian County Government has been vigorously banning drugs and trafficking recently, which has caused dissatisfaction among Korean vagrants. Previously, more than a dozen Koreans, including Cui Lie, broke into the county government, destroying the first and second sections, the mail room, and the communications office.

<p>(Nanjing) Gao Yihan, accompanied by his secretary Shao Yunfu, arrived in Beijing at 5:00 PM on the 26th, taking the Jianghua ship from Hankou. Reporters greeted him on the ship to inquire about the actual situation of the disaster in Hubei. According to him, this year's disaster in Hubei is even more severe than in the 20th year of the Republic. The counties and cities flooded in the flood of the 20th year of the Republic were mostly areas that had been flooded in previous floods. This year, the Zhen River also breached, and 49 of the 70 counties in the province were completely flooded. Although the remaining 21 counties were spared from the disaster, several counties in northern Hubei reported drought. Regarding the responsibility for this flood of Yang Silian, Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, we will not discuss it for the time being. However, from the 12th to the 16th, when the Zhanggong Dike was at a critical juncture, he was never seen on the dike. Later, it was found that Yang was staying in Tongren Hospital for several days to treat a skin rupture on his wrist, which is regrettable. The purpose of my visit to Beijing this time is to report the results of the disaster survey and the process of supervising the emergency rescue project to the Control Yuan. I also have some suggestions to the Central Government on the current water conservancy administrative system in China, in order to seek a long-term solution.

<h3 id="e23">Appealing on Behalf of Disaster Victims <a href="#e23" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c23" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">23</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>In recent days, the water level of the Yangtze River has been receding. The people in the Wuhan area are fortunate to have avoided the disaster of becoming fish food. The Yellow River's torrents have not yet reached Weishan Lake, and northern Jiangsu also seems to be without immediate danger. Although the autumn flood season has not yet passed and the future is still uncertain, the current situation can be tolerated for the time being. In this time of initial respite, the issue that concerns us the most is the resettlement of the people in the disaster areas. According to the statistics of the Hubei Provincial Disaster Relief Association, in the disaster-stricken areas of 49 counties, there are 7,149,712 disaster victims. In other provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Hunan, and Jiangxi, the number of disaster victims gathered and awaiting relief may be even higher than this number. The funds required for relief, just for Hubei Province alone, already require 19 million yuan. Combined with the expenses of the whole country, the amount will be even more alarming. Recalling the government's depleted treasury, there is a risk of being unable to make ends meet at any time. Even if preparations are sufficient, the huge amount needed to cope with the flood control effort is already a cause for concern. The plan for post-disaster recovery seems even more difficult to implement.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, human beings are most endowed with the sympathy of weighing and considering [others' needs]. Natural disasters occur in every country from time to time. Even enemies think about showing sympathy. The event of Qin and Jin sailing boats together is a beautiful story passed down through the ages. Moreover, we all live in the same region, sharing weal and woe. Fortunately, we have not been affected by the flooding, and we are able to protect ourselves with our families and children after having our fill. Thinking of the disaster victims in the flooded areas of the north and south, who are exposed to the wind and dew and crying for food, their situation of being displaced, wandering, and helpless can be imagined without the need for elaborate description. Since we are all human beings, how can we not have feelings of fear and compassion? We should reduce our clothing and food consumption and contribute generously. Even if a drop in the bucket is not enough, it can be gathered to form a fur coat. When things have come to this point, we should not consider the effectiveness, but only do our best to respond to the situation to put our minds at ease. As for the government's relief funds, if they can raise a substantial amount, they should determine the steps to take and manage them in a unified manner. Emergency relief is indeed a timely measure, but there should be a permanent plan for post-disaster recovery. For example, if there are 7 million disaster victims, the number of educated men and women, children of school age, and those with construction skills among these 7 million people should be clearly investigated and provided with places to settle down separately. The remaining personnel who cannot be settled may as well be used as the backbone team for water management. With the relief funds as capital and the disaster victims as labor, we can start the dredging project. When the pain is just beginning to be felt, and the past is not forgotten, it is easier to achieve results by considering the time and effort. Moreover, if this is used to appeal to the public, the relief funds will have a twofold meaning, and the willingness to donate will surely be greatly increased. It depends on human effort. The authorities must not neglect it.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The righteous army besieging Xing'an Naiman Banner is from the Liu Zhendong unit, with a strength of approximately eight hundred men. This morning at five o'clock, the Japanese air force stationed in Gongzhuling was ordered to dispatch. The cavalry unit stationed in Kailu and the Japanese garrison in Zhengjiatun also departed at five o'clock this morning. The vanguard, a police force of one hundred and fifty men from "Manchukuo," engaged in battle with the righteous army at ten o'clock this morning. Once the Japanese-Manchu allied forces arrive, a general offensive will commence. The "Manchu" and Mongolian Affairs Department convened a meeting this morning to discuss countermeasures, seeking the cause of the mutiny in order to fundamentally resolve the situation. (Hualian Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to a telegram received by the Mongolian Affairs Department, the Liu Zhendong unit has completely occupied Naiman City and openly taken hostile actions against the Japanese army. The "Manchukuo" Gendarmerie and the Xing'an West Province Police Force launched a general offensive this morning with a small force of one hundred and fifty men. After fierce fighting, numerous casualties have occurred. However, the Liu Zhendong unit is resisting stubbornly, so the "Manchu" army is currently awaiting Japanese reinforcements. (Dentsu Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Yesterday, the Zhengjiatun Independent Garrison Unit, leading a machine gun unit, infantry unit, communications unit, and cavalry unit, departed to suppress the Liu Zhendong unit occupying the Naiman Brigade Public Office. (Dentsu Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to a statement from the "Manchu" Military and Political Department authorities, the Xing'anling Flying Squadron, after reconnaissance of the Naiman Banner Public Office at seven o'clock this morning, has commenced suppression operations. Currently, the sorghum is lush, and out of concern for damaging the city streets of the banner, bombing has not been carried out. However, if the "bandits" resist stubbornly, bombing will be unavoidable. As for the Japanese who have been kidnapped, there is likely no hope for them. (Dentsu Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The Japanese and Mongolian Affairs Department authorities convened an emergency meeting at ten o'clock this morning regarding the follow-up measures for the Naiman Banner incident. The issue behind this incident involves the governance of both Mongolian and Manchu ethnicities in the Rehe Mongolian region. Therefore, it has a significant impact on the administrative direction of Manchukuo and is worthy of serious attention. (Dentsu Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) According to a public announcement received by the Changchun Mongolian Affairs Department at four o'clock in the afternoon on the 25th, the purpose of the attack on the Naiman Banner Public Office was indeed to brutally massacre Japanese. Nakane and Tsuruta have already been killed in action, and other Japanese have been kidnapped, their fates unknown. Furthermore, the Japanese and Manchu armies have completed a complete encirclement of the "bandit" group. (Dentsu Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) The following is a statement by Vice Minister Yoda of the Manchukuo Mongolian Affairs Department: Before the Manchurian Incident, "bandits" were already rampant in the Naiman Banner area. The situation has greatly improved after the Incident. Currently, security is mainly maintained by the Manchu police, and self-defense corps are organized to promote the autonomy of the Mongolian ethnicity. The reasons for the occurrence of this incident are: (1) The area was formerly known as Suidong County, and dissatisfaction arose after it was changed to a banner and incorporated into Inner Mongolia. (2) Councilor Yamamori secretly and strictly suppressed bandits, causing resentment. (Dentsu Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol has received a note from the Abyssinian government, reiterating its request for the immediate convening of a League of Nations Executive Council meeting to address the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. The note states that due to the urgency of the situation, the League of Nations Executive Council should intervene immediately. The negotiations made by several countries to peacefully resolve the dispute will not be hindered by the intervention of the Executive Council. The resolution previously passed by the Executive Council stipulated that if the Italo-Abyssinian arbitration committee cannot reach a compromise by July 25th, the Executive Council should immediately convene a meeting to appoint a fifth neutral arbitrator. Currently, this deadline has passed, and the situation has not changed. After receiving this note, Avenol telegraphed all members attending the Executive Council in the afternoon. Once he receives replies from various countries, he can decide the date of the Executive Council meeting, which is expected to be around July 31st. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Abyssinia today requested the League of Nations Executive Council to convene a meeting to find a way to avoid the East African war. Italy suddenly sent a telegram, signed by Undersecretary Suvich, stating its willingness to submit the Italo-Abyssinian dispute to arbitration negotiations. The Italian telegram arrived on the day the League of Nations' deadline for arbitration negotiations was about to expire. The telegram stated that Italy's previous opposition to arbitration was because the matters that Abyssinia requested to discuss were not within the scope of the League of Nations arbitration agreement. Italy sent two telegrams to the Abyssinian capital on July 14th and 23rd, urging Abyssinia to withdraw these requests so that the arbitration committee could continue its work. The League of Nations authorities are studying the telegrams from both Italy and Abyssinia in order to decide whether to immediately convene an Executive Council meeting and to determine whether arbitration negotiations can continue. (Guomin Telegram, 25th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Executive Council today asked Secretary-General Avenol to decide before tomorrow afternoon whether the meeting to consider the Italo-Abyssinian dispute should be held on July 30th or August 1st. The first task of the League of Nations Executive Council at the meeting will be to decide whether the scope of discussion should be limited to border conflicts or whether to consider the entire dispute. Avenol replied that the Executive Council members could decide on July 31st or August 1st. However, regardless of which day the meeting is held, it will begin at 5:00 PM. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Attempts to peacefully resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute have made no progress after Undersecretary Suvich held talks with the British Ambassador to Italy yesterday. Yesterday, British Ambassador Drummond visited Undersecretary Suvich, claiming to discuss minor matters unrelated to the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. However, during the conversation, he still brought up the Abyssinian issue as an aside. Drummond did not put forward any new suggestions. Britain expressed its support for the compromise plan established last week (i.e., Italy would build a railway through Abyssinia in Italian Somaliland and Eritrea, and Abyssinia would grant Italy broad trade benefits as conditions for resolving the dispute). If this compromise plan cannot be established, it is decided to submit the issue to the League of Nations Executive Council for handling in its entirety. Also, during yesterday's mass rally in Rome to send off troops to East Africa, the masses held various insulting signs against Britain, which greatly angered the British expatriates in Italy. The disputes between Britain and Italy have therefore increased. As for France's efforts, its purpose is to support last week's compromise plan. According to the 1906 Anglo-Franco-Italian Treaty (i.e., if one of the signatory countries wants to intervene in the Abyssinian issue, it should first consult with the other countries), a conference of Britain, France, and Italy should be convened to resolve the dispute. France advocates expanding Italy's rights in Abyssinia, imitating the cooperation model between Britain and Iraq. On the one hand, Italy abandons its war against Abyssinia, and on the other hand, Britain makes broad concessions to Italy. However, given the current situation, this compromise plan seems unlikely to be realized, because the Italian newspapers continue to make anti-British remarks, and the tensions between Britain and Italy are high. The only outcome may be to submit the matter to the League of Nations Executive Council for handling. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<h3 id="e28">Italian Government Document Reopens Path to Mediation, Does Not Refuse to Send Representatives to Attend League of Nations Meeting <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Secretary-General of the League of Nations has released an Italian government document, which shows that Italy hopes that the League of Nations Executive Council will postpone its meeting to consider the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. The document states that the mediation and arbitration procedures were suspended entirely because the Abyssinian government's representatives in Sheveningen made requests and insisted that the committee discuss issues not included in the arbitration agreement. The Italian government now wishes to continue with these procedures to completion. At the same time, the League of Nations Executive Council has received a letter from the Abyssinian government stating that the League of Nations Executive Council should convene a meeting as soon as possible to consider the Abyssinian request made under Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. The Italian government document also states that the Italian government has notified the Abyssinian government that it is willing to have the committee reconvene in accordance with the scope of the arbitration committee agreement to mediate the disputes between the two countries, and asks the Abyssinian government to withdraw its previous requests so that the committee can continue its work. Geneva sees this Italian document as indicating that the Italian government believes that mediation has not yet reached a dead end. The document implies that the Italian government will limit the discussions in Geneva to border conflicts and conditions for mediators to refer to, and that the League of Nations Executive Council will be allowed to propose the appointment of a fifth arbitrator. This policy conforms to the government's views and will postpone the general discussion of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute by one month. However, it is still doubtful whether the Abyssinian representatives agree to this procedure. According to opinions within the League of Nations, the Italian government document has actually reopened the path to mediation. If the Abyssinian government's reply agrees, the deadline for negotiations will be extended to August 25th. If so, the issue of the League of Nations Executive Council meeting next week will be void. If the Abyssinian government's reply refuses, the Executive Council will meet as scheduled. Most people expect the Abyssinian government to refuse. However, in any case, the Italian government will obviously try its best to limit the discussion of the Executive Council meeting to mediation issues. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Regarding the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, Italy believes that it can now obtain a solution that can be accepted by the country. Therefore, the country does not have to withdraw from the League of Nations and can obtain freedom of action in East Africa. Italian government officials believe that Japan's actions in the four northeastern provinces of China in the past, although criticized, are not as serious as the current Italo-Abyssinian dispute. Italian public opinion has recently eased because the British Cabinet refused to issue export licenses for military supplies to Abyssinia. The British government has now decided to send Minister without Portfolio Eden to Geneva to attend the extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council, and has reportedly ordered him to adopt a moderate attitude. (Havas Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to Italian semi-official sources, Italy does not recognize the League of Nations' right to fully discuss the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, believing that the Italo-Abyssinian Treaty was signed after Italy and Abyssinia joined the League of Nations. Therefore, the procedures contained in the Italo-Abyssinian Treaty should be applied to disputes between the two countries, and not the procedures of the League of Nations Covenant. As for the present, Italy does not refuse to send representatives to Geneva to attend the meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council. However, if the methods passed by the Executive Council to handle the Italo-Abyssinian dispute are contrary to Italy's claims, Italy will withdraw from the League of Nations and withdraw its representatives from the League of Nations.

<p>(Paris) According to official sources, the League of Nations Executive Council has scheduled a meeting on the 31st of this month to discuss the Italo-Abyssinian dispute.

One flag depicted a Fascist Party member holding an axe and splitting a flag with a cross of Britain and Japan. Another flag depicted the Abyssinian King hanging upside down by his trousers. Demonstrators shouted "Down with Abyssinia!", "Down with Britain!", "Down with Japan!" The cries were echoed by tens of thousands of people, shaking the streets. The Fascist Youth League sang revolutionary songs, interspersed with shouts against Britain, Abyssinia, and Japan. The League of Nations was also subjected to venomous slander. Huge posters were pasted all over the streets, alluding to the three countries of Britain, Abyssinia, and Japan. Under the posters were slogans saying, "Rome will preserve Europe, we must win!" There were also brown posters depicting Europeans, Japanese, and Filipinos having friendly relations, and Abyssinia selling slaves. The slogans occasionally included the cry of "Malta! Malta!" General Starace, the Secretary of the Fascist Party, gave a speech to the crowd on the platform, demanding the opening up of territories for Italy. Similar gatherings were held in major cities across the country. Given the public's resentment towards Britain and Japan, the authorities have dispatched special guards to strictly protect the British and Japanese embassies. At the same time, the diplomatic circles of France, Britain, and Italy are also very active. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has moved to his residence at the Rocca delle Caminate castle. Mussolini goes there whenever he makes important decisions. Emergency documents are now being sent there daily for review. Last night, a large ship departed from Liverpool for East Africa, carrying 1,000 machine gunners, who were disbanded from the Italian army's cavalry. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) A demonstration was held here to send off troops to East Africa, initiated by various Fascist Party groups. At 10:00 PM, they gathered at the Piazza Colonna in front of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, each holding a sign saying that Italy should maintain freedom of action and not be bound by world public opinion, and that the firm will of the Italian nation cannot be hindered by anything. Fanziogli Gracci, the General Secretary of the Fascist Party, gave a passionate speech, saying that the war against Abyssinia can be won, and we should all sacrifice ourselves for the country.

<p>(Rome) Italy continues to prepare for war on a large scale today. Troops, supplies, and arms are being concentrated throughout the country, and soldiers and military supplies are being continuously transported to East Africa. According to news here today, 40,000 officers are currently undergoing strict training, so that after the mobilization of the 1915 and 1916 classes, 500,000 troops can have commanders. According to Italy's military plan, 1.7 million people can be mobilized within two months. (Guomin Telegram, 25th)</p>

<p>(Paris) The Abyssinian Emperor, in an interview with a special correspondent of "Paris Evening News," stated, "I have always trusted the resolutions that the League of Nations can make, especially if Britain and France can uphold justice and join Abyssinia's side, then I should trust them even more. However, it is impossible to make any territorial or economic concessions to Italy. If the two countries declare war, I should first serve on the battlefield and live and die with the soldiers. As for the Italian army, it is very likely to fail. Firstly, the Italian army is separated by Italian Somaliland on one side and British Somaliland on the other, making communication very inconvenient. Secondly, it will encounter endless difficulties fighting in the high mountains. Thirdly, there is a complete lack of drinking water in the Gorden Desert, making it inconvenient to march. Fourthly, there will be many deserters from the indigenous troops of Italian Somaliland and Eritrea. These are all ways for Italy to fail." The Abyssinian Emperor then lamented that various countries have banned the transport of military supplies to Abyssinia, and that the contracts for the purchase of military supplies signed by Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and the United States have all been cancelled.

<p>(London) According to semi-official sources, if Italy goes to war with Abyssinia, the issue of blocking the Suez Canal should be considered. However, this move should be initiated by the League of Nations. It is also said that the actual power to block the canal is currently in the hands of the Suez Canal Board of Directors. If the canal is blocked, the canal's income will be greatly reduced. Therefore, it is feared that this proposal will be difficult to obtain the consent of the Board of Directors. However, it is generally believed that if the governments of the countries participating in the Suez Canal Board of Directors unanimously request a blockade, the Board of Directors will not be able to refuse.

<p>The Hague Queen of the Netherlands today appointed Dr. Aalberse, leader of the Catholic Party in Parliament, to form a cabinet. The Colijn cabinet resigned this morning because it was unable to cope with the country's economic difficulties.

After the cabinet resigned, the Queen was very willing for Colijn to temporarily stay in office to maintain the stability of the Dutch currency, but Colijn's determination to leave was so strong that he could not be retained. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>Netherlands Financial circles believe that the Catholic Party leader Aalbers will decline to form a cabinet, because Aalbers cannot find sufficient support from other political parties to create a majority in parliament.

As a result of the invention of this method, each ton of coal costing ten yuan can be used to produce a ton of heavy oil worth forty yuan, which is a major revolution in heavy industry.

<p>(London) Employees of Burlington House found this morning when they arrived at the building that the 18-foot-high iron gate had been locked, the first time this has happened in many years. There were many armed guards in the courtyard protecting the trucks carrying Chinese antiques. After 9:00 AM, the gate was opened, and a truck drove to the side of Burlington House, after which the gate was closed again. The boxes were then successively transported into the warehouse to await unpacking. Great care was taken when unloading, for fear of damaging the antiques. This work was supervised by Zheng Tiansi. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>
<p>(London) Now that the British warship Suffolk has transported Chinese antiques to England, its captain, Manners, has been promoted to rear admiral. He has requested to retire due to old age. Many newspapers have commented on the arrival of Chinese antiques in England, which is very beneficial to the promotion of the exhibition. The Times stated that the beauty of the exhibits will certainly fill and exceed the excitement that has already arisen. The timing of this exhibition is quite good, because due to the cultivation of Lawrence Binyon and other scholars of Eastern art, the general public has recently become deeply aware of the greatness of Chinese art. Chinese artists are respected by the world, unlike some later Eastern artists who are jealous and afraid of them and impose their needs to exclude others' strengths by being arrogant. It would be a pleasure if Western art continued to be influenced by Chinese art in what it urgently needs. Will these ninety-three boxes of Chinese art exhibit their strange power here? The Morning Post stated that Chinese works of art have now arrived safely in England. No ship that has come to England has ever carried items of greater value than this. Britain has been using Burlington House as a place for winter exhibitions of the art of a country for many years, and it has become a very good habit. Masterpieces of Italy, France, Belgium, Holland, and Persia have been appreciated by London. Now, thanks to the generosity of the Chinese government, England can appreciate some of Chinese art. Perhaps the exhibits can be poetic material for the vagaries of the world. (Reuters Telegram, 26th)</p>

<p>(Moscow) The Seventh Congress of the Third International opened today in the Workers' Auditorium. More than 600 people attended, representing 65 countries around the world. Representatives from various countries had been attending preparatory meetings here for several weeks. Due to the inconvenience of their actions in their home countries, they all attended under assumed names. The reports from representatives of various countries stated that the economic panic in capitalist countries has not yet turned around. If this situation continues as before, the world revolution will not be far off. The leader of the German Communist Party, Thalmann, who previously participated in the German presidential election, is currently detained by the German National Socialist Party and was unable to attend. However, the representatives at the meeting unanimously elected Thalmann as the honorary chairman of this session. When Stalin, in his capacity as Secretary-General of the Central Executive Committee of the Soviet Communist Party, attended the congress, the whole venue erupted in thunderous applause. The Soviet Communist Party's organ, *Pravda*, argued that the work of the Communist Party today is to maintain liberal democracy as the only bulwark against fascism. Some people believe that this kind of argument by *Pravda* can be seen as a major revolution in communism, because before this, the Communist Parties of various countries attacked the governments of property owners, regardless of whether they were liberal or not, but from now on, they will differentiate between them.

<p>(Paris) A carpenter named Milian here has ingeniously created a small airplane with an engine power of 25 horsepower, costing only 10,000 francs. After completion, it was named "Flying Locust". It is estimated that up to 10,000 units can be manufactured within a year. The advantage of this aircraft is its simple structure. The two wings are installed on the same horizontal plane in front and behind the fuselage. The wings are fully extended during flight, and when it reaches maximum speed, the ends of both wings can be retracted into the fuselage. Thus, the width of the wings is reduced by one-third, and the air resistance is reduced accordingly, and the speed will naturally increase. When landing, simply extend the wings to gradually reduce the speed. This method was invented by a Russian immigrant named Makunin and has recently been approved by the Ministry of Aviation. Currently, the enthusiasm for promoting the "Flying Locust" throughout France is comparable to Germany's promotion of gliding. (Havas News Agency Telegram of the 26th)</p>

<h3 id="e90">Inspection Report on Flood Conditions Along the Rivers, Special Correspondent Geng Ya of This Newspaper <a href="#e90" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c90" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">90</a></h3>
<p>Visit to the Disaster Areas of Zhang Gong Embankment and Jinyintan</p>
<p>Hankou is situated at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers. It is bordered by the Yangtze River in the front, and the Xiang River and Yu Lake in the back. The embankments along the rivers, including the Zhang Gong Embankment, encircle the city like a crescent moon, spanning eighty or ninety li in length. Outside the embankment, the vast expanse of water has transformed into a marshland. Inside, the terrain is low-lying, with the water level reaching about ten feet higher. During the 1931 Zhang Gong Embankment breach, the city of Hankou was flooded to a depth of several feet. This time, despite minor leaks, the embankment was successfully defended due to effective precautions, avoiding a repeat of the disaster from twenty years ago. As I awaited the ship heading further up the Yangtze River, I decided to conduct an inspection of the Zhang Gong Embankment.</p>
<p>On the 25th, I set off by car at five in the morning. As the urban landscape of the Pinghan Railway faded into the distance, the rural scenery came into view. The roadside was adorned with golden rice paddies and white lotus flowers, their fragrant aroma permeating the air. Bathed in the morning sun, I felt as if I were cleansing my spirit in an ice urn. Before we had traveled fifteen li, the sounds of laboring and the scent of sweat from the embankment workers at Gusushu greeted us. Gusushu is a small town nestled against the embankment, crowded with embankment workers and refugees, creating a bustling scene. Several days ago, the inner slope of the nearby embankment suddenly began to sink into the lotus swamp. Immediate rescue efforts were launched around the clock. Due to the high water level in Moon Lake outside the embankment and the low-lying terrain inside, it was impossible to resist the water's force. As a result, the pilings shifted, and the soil subsided. Five rows of large pilings were driven in, but they all gradually moved and collapsed into the lotus swamp along with the surrounding soil. Fortunately, the water receded by five or six feet, allowing them to narrowly avert disaster. However, the work of driving pilings and pressing soil continues day and night, proceeding actively.</p>
<p>The area along the embankment is covered with reed and straw sheds, serving as offices for the "Jianghan Engineering Bureau," the "Flood Prevention Association," and the "Ordnance Factory." They also serve as places where the "Good Deeds Association," the "Municipal Health Department," the "Municipal Oil Industry Association," and various charitable organizations provide tea, medicine, and steamed buns. Other areas serve as storage for engineering materials such as burlap sacks, reed mats, bamboo, wood, and hemp rope. Most of the male workers are engaged in driving pilings and building earthworks, working in groups of dozens, their voices echoing for miles. Women carry soil and transport materials, tirelessly working back and forth. Plainclothes soldiers and supervisory personnel, often armed with long bamboo poles, direct the work and maintain order. Small snack vendors have also set up stalls along the roadside, creating a lively atmosphere reminiscent of a rural market. However, a closer look at the faces of those present reveals an unspoken inner anxiety, which the tense atmosphere of fighting the raging floodwaters cannot completely conceal. This is because the safety and well-being of Hankou's eight hundred thousand residents and their property depend on whether this embankment can be effectively defended.</p>
<p>Flooded Scenery on the Riverside Road of Hankou</p>
<p>Traveling downstream along the embankment for about seven or eight li, we encountered more than twenty workers repairing leaks. The soil needed for the repairs had to be dug from the opposite bank of the lotus swamp, making transportation by boat inconvenient. The inner slope of the embankment was covered in lush green grass, with herds of cattle grazing. In the distance, the fields were golden with grain, and the cotton was in bloom, suggesting the promise of a bountiful harvest. However, to the left, the raging waves crashed against the embankment with a deafening roar. Villages such as Jinyintan, Qijiatun, Xingjiatun, and Zhangjiatun had all been submerged, transformed into underwater palaces. Crops had been washed away, and villagers had sought refuge on the embankment, erecting makeshift shelters with reed mats and digging holes for stoves, barely able to escape the wind and rain and eke out a living.</p>
<p>Jinyintan is only a li or two away from the embankment. The collapsed walls and standing pillars, along with the tree branches brushing against the water, were clearly visible. We hired a boat to cross over, and the depth of the water felt considerable. The boatman tested the depth with an oar, revealing it to be more than fifteen feet deep. We first reached Jintan, where only a few dozen roof tiles remained visible. Everywhere else was water. One family, surnamed Yang, had a house on slightly higher ground, and the water had receded from their courtyard. The owner was sweeping away the silt, preparing to return home. When asked, "The water hasn't completely receded, why are you rushing back?" he replied, "The reed shed on the embankment only provides minimal shelter from the sun. If it rains at night, we will still be drenched." When asked about the living conditions of the villagers, he replied, "On the night of July 11th, the floodwaters came fiercely, initially rising by a foot or so. By dawn, the water had entered our homes, rising steadily by five or six feet. Jintan has about 170 households, and Yintan has 110. The cries of despair shook the fields like an earthquake. In a panic, everyone grabbed small boats and wooden objects, risking their lives to float to the embankment. The wheat had just been harvested, and the melons were ripe but not yet picked. Everyone was too busy trying to save their lives to worry about the melons and wheat. For the past half-month, the flood victims have been relying on duckweed (floating plants), water chestnut leaves (i.e., water chestnut leaves), and wheat bran for food, but even these are becoming scarce. If benevolent people don't come to our rescue, the flood victims will soon turn into starving corpses on land." The owner had a son, twelve or thirteen years old, who was studying at a primary school in Huangpi. He was also present and pointed out the watermarks on the remaining walls, measuring them with his height, appearing lively and adorable. The owner sighed and said, "This child would have graduated in a year, and his grades are not bad, but he will have to drop out of school from now on. What a pity!" The boy, hearing this, forced a smile, but his innocent heart could not contain his tears, which welled up in his eyes.</p>
<p>We then boated to Yintan, where the scene was similar to Jintan. However, Yintan had also suffered a fire on April 11th, making the lives of the villagers even more miserable. Ashore, we saw an old woman leading her granddaughters, their feet covered in mud and their hair disheveled, salvaging what remained of their belongings that had not been washed away. Upon seeing the reporter, she mistook me for a disaster relief worker and stumbled forward through the mud to greet me, wiping away tears with the corner of her shirt. Knowing what she wanted, I was thinking of how to comfort her when she suddenly slipped and fell in the mud. I rushed forward to help her up, and her granddaughters also ran over. The old woman lamented, crying and saying, "Yintan has suffered both flood and fire within a hundred days. The common people are truly cursed. But the officials don't allow us to perform operas for the gods, which is also a mistake. The water rose more than ten feet high overnight. What else could it be but divine water? Alas, truly cursed, truly cursed." After comforting her, I entered a relatively intact house. I saw a bed turned upside down on the central beam, with miscellaneous items and wooden puppets stored on it. A dead dog was tied to a pillar in the courtyard, already smelling foul. The owner must have fled in a hurry, forgetting to untie it, leading to its death. On the way back by boat, the boatman suddenly asked, "Is Zhang Xueliang the son of Zhang Zhidong?" Amused by his question, I asked, "Why do you ask?" He replied, "This Zhang Gong Embankment was built by Zhang Zhidong. When the floodwaters rose, a blue dragon was seen baring its teeth and claws in the lake by a member of the Zhang family. It is said that a god opera will be performed in Gusushu for three days starting on the 28th, and then the dragon will ascend and the water will recede. If Zhang is truly the son of Zhang Gong, we can hope that floods will be reduced in the future." It is unexpected that ignorant people constantly attribute fortune and misfortune to fate. After a major disaster, there are even more far-fetched superstitious claims. While their feelings are understandable, it also reveals the shortcomings of a lack of education.</p>
<p>After passing through Shanlishan, Danshuichi, Fenjinlu, and other places, we bypassed the Japanese concession's riverside embankment. At first, I did not realize it was the Japanese concession until I saw many sandbags piled up along the riverside road. The wind and waves outside the embankment also seemed stronger than near the Jianghan Customs House. I was about to take a photo when I saw a sign next to the sandbag pile that read "Freedom of Entry and Exit." Realizing where I was because of the different wording, I first informed the Indian police officer, who shook his head and stopped me. Passing between wharves 2 and 3 in Special District 3, I saw more than ten workers bathing naked outside the embankment on Linjiang Road. A patrolman suddenly jumped out from inside the embankment, grabbed their clothes, and left. These people recklessly enjoyed the convenience of bathing in the river and suffered this blow. It could be said that they gained less than they lost.</p>
<p>Zhang Gong Embankment Repair Situation</p>
<p>Crossing the river, I visited Mr. Feng Ruofei and Mr. Deng Hejiu, secretaries of the provincial government. According to them, "This time, the flood in Hubei Province has caused fifty or sixty embankment breaches and around five hundred polder breaches. The area and population affected by the disaster have not yet been statistically determined. According to estimates from the counties reporting disasters, only one or two cotton-producing counties remain in the entire province, and the loss of cotton harvest is estimated to be over 100 million yuan. The loss of provincial business tax revenue will also reach 600,000 to 700,000 yuan. A total of forty-nine locations have reported disasters. Although these are not all counties, they are all key areas. Hanchuan and Tianmen are still submerged. The water is gradually receding in more than half of the remaining areas. However, 12 million yuan is needed for emergency, agricultural, industrial, and relief funds, and only over 400,000 yuan has been raised, which is less than one-tenth of the plan. We urgently hope that the central government and people from all walks of life will provide strong support." They also said, "Although the disaster situation in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River is severe, it is not as bad as that in the Xiang River basin. The water level in the Yangtze River basin, such as in the severely affected areas of Jingmen and Yichang, has gradually receded. However, many counties in the Xiang River basin are still suffering in deep water and scorching heat. To inspect the situation, we should first choose counties in the Xiang River basin. However, transportation is inconvenient, and the journey is much more arduous than traveling by Yangtze River steamer." Therefore, I decided to inspect Xiangcheng first and planned to depart on the 26th. If the roads are clear, I may take the Xiangxianghua Road and then take the Pinghan train north to investigate the Yellow River disaster.</p>
<h3 id="e91">Emergency Construction of the Great Embankment in Northern Jiangsu <a href="#e91" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c91" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">91</a></h3>
<p>Reasons Why Yellow River Water Has Not Immediately Flooded Weishan Lake; Major Construction of the Great Embankment is Nearing Completion</p>
<p>Xuzhou Correspondence: Following the Yellow River breach in Western Shandong, the Yellow River water flowed into Nanyang Lake. Because the terrain between Nanyang Lake and Weishan Lake is relatively high, and there is no continuous major flow of water, the Yellow River water has not yet flooded Weishan Lake. Xia Town, located on the northern bank of Weishan Lake and connected to the Central Canal, has also not seen any Yellow River water. However, because the lakes between Northern Jiangsu and Southern Shandong are interconnected, and there have been heavy rains in recent days, the water level has risen slightly. Inspector Ding Chaowu, Commissioner Shao Hanyuan, and Committee Member Lan Weibin traveled by steamship to the banks of Weishan Lake on the 24th to inspect the situation and supervise the embankment construction. Engineer Yu Shufang, specially dispatched by the Construction Department, also went from Pei County to Xia Town on the 24th to inspect the area and set up water gauges to confirm that the water from Nanyang Lake was overflowing northward. Therefore, the water has not yet flooded into the counties under the jurisdiction of Northern Jiangsu and Xuzhou. Currently, they are busy constructing the Great Embankment of Northern Jiangsu and the Lianjia Dam Embankment, as well as inspecting the canal locks. Technicians from the counties bordering Shandong, Anhui, and the counties under the jurisdiction of Xuzhou have been gathering in Xuzhou in recent days for inspection. Due to differing interests, they have different views on the embankment construction. Ding, Shao, and Lan all believe that the Great Embankment of Northern Jiangsu should be completed as soon as possible, while the Lianjia Dam Embankment requires further inspection before a decision can be made. The Provincial Governor has not been able to attend to the water conservancy issues in Jiangbei in the past, and now should thoroughly plan for them.</p>
<p>Overflowing Water from Nanyang Lake</p>
<p>The Yellow River water flowing south from the breach at Linpu is divided into two streams that flow into Nanyang Lake. One stream enters Zhaowang River via Juye and flows into Dushan Lake to flood Nanyang Lake. The other stream enters Niutou River via Jiaxiang to flood Nanyang Lake. The two streams are competing, so the water in Nanyang Lake is rising rapidly. Because the terrain between Nanyang Lake and Weishan Lake is relatively high, the lake water overflows northward. Part of the water floods towards Jining, and part of the water enters Yutai. Currently, postal and telecommunications between Yutai and Jining have been cut off. Yutai's southern border is adjacent to Feng and Pei counties, which are under the jurisdiction of Xuzhou. Feng County sent Peng Shiting and Huang Tirun to inspect the Nanyang Lake area near Yutai a few days ago. The Yuanwa Lake dam in the northeast of Yutai has a breach of over 20 zhang. The Fifth District of Yutai is severely affected by the disaster. There is an old dam along the lake, starting from the northwest at Yuanwa and extending southeast to Chengzi Temple in Pei County, for a length of over 80 li. Yutai is currently conscripting laborers to repair the dam. Because of this overflow of water from Nanyang Lake, the water has not been able to flood Weishan Lake. Therefore, when Ding, Lan, and others inspected the area yesterday, the water level was still stable. Xia Town is located on the northern border of Pei County, on the northern bank of Weishan Lake. It is an important passage connecting the lake to the canal. In the past, before the canal transport was abolished, it was an important area. Pei County has set up a water gauge here. Engineer Yu went to inspect the area yesterday and did not see any Yellow River water. If there are no more major floods, then Northern Jiangsu may be spared from the water disaster. However, according to Engineers Zhou Yushan and Zhao Yusu, who were sent to Shandong by the Construction Department and the Huai River Conservancy Committee to inspect the breach, they returned to Xuzhou and reported that they inspected the breach at Linpu on the 20th. There were a total of six breaches. The first two breaches have silted up. The third and fourth breaches have very little water flow. The fifth breach is the largest, with a length of 300 meters. The sixth breach is the next largest, with a length of 120 meters. The distance between the fifth and sixth breaches is about 800 meters. The water flow is strong in both breaches. When inspecting the area, it took three hours to travel five li upstream by boat and only half an hour to travel downstream. Moreover, if a major flood continues, it may even wash away the remaining dam between the fifth and sixth breaches, and the two breaches may merge into one, then the water situation will be uncontrollable. Zhang Lianjia, Director of the Shandong River Affairs Bureau, is monitoring the breach and plans to carry out willow plugging work, but it is unknown whether it will be effective.</p>
<p>The Great Embankment of Northern Jiangsu</p>
<p>The counties under the jurisdiction of Xuzhou view the Great Embankment of Northern Jiangsu as a safeguard for the northwestern half of the region. However, it is by no means intended to stop the Yellow River water from diverting the canal. The embankment starts from Chengzi Temple in northern Pei County, connects to the old dam in Lutai in the north, and extends to Fangcun in northern Tong County in the south, close to the Yunkou Lock. The Yutai Embankment borders the west bank of Nanyang Port and is intended to prevent the westward flooding of Nanyang Lake. The embankment borders the west bank of Weishan Lake and is intended to prevent the westward overflow of Weishan Lake water. If the Yellow River water enters Weishan Lake, it will inevitably divert the canal. If it is unavoidable, the water can only be allowed to enter the canal from the southeastern bank of the lake. It must not be allowed to overflow to the southwestern bank. Therefore, the construction of this embankment is intended to prevent the flooding of Weishan Lake and serve as a barrier for the northeastern border of Feng, Pei, Xiao, Dang, and Tong counties. It has nothing to do with the Yellow River changing its course and diverting the canal. The Yunkou Lock is indeed related to the connection between Weishan Lake and the canal. However, it is a lock and not an embankment. In the past, during canal transport, the water in Weishan Canal was regulated by the lock. The provincial government and the counties along the canal all advocate for its repair, as the lock is the key to Weishan Canal. The canal has been in disrepair for a long time, and if a large amount of water is suddenly released, the canal will not be able to accommodate it. With a lock and a dam, the canal can be maintained. At the same time, the embankments along the canal are also being repaired urgently. However, a thorough overhaul of the canal would involve a large project and would have to wait for a later date. The counties along the canal hope that the provincial government will be able to repair the canal as soon as possible, so as to avoid being caught off guard in emergencies. Engineers Zhou Yushan and Zhao Yusu went to Hanzhuang yesterday morning to inspect the Yunkou Lock. They returned to the provincial capital by train last night from Hanzhuang. It is likely that the provincial government will formulate plans for reorganization after the two engineers submit their reports on the Yunkou Lock. Zhang Shuchun, a technician from Teng County, was sent to Xuzhou by the Shandong Construction Department to investigate the relationship between the Great Embankment of Northern Jiangsu and the Yunkou Lock. He conducted a thorough investigation and seemed to hold dissenting opinions regarding the construction of the embankment and the repair of the lock. After the investigation, he may be persuaded.</p>
<p>Inspection of Lianjia Dam</p>
<p>Lianjia Dam is located in the northern part of Tongshan County, south of Zhanggushan. It is the main lock and dam connecting to Weishan Lake. The southern bank of Weishan Lake is separated by a narrow strip of water, connecting to Zhanggushan. The water flows south through Zhanggushan to Lianjia Dam, where there are two rivers, the old and the new. One flows east, and the other flows south and then east, merging back into one to form the Bulao River, which enters the central canal of Pi County. This is the main river in northern Tong County. The Tongshan County Government has been ordered to repair the lock and build the dam. Although it is located in Tong County, it has a related impact on the counties to the east and west of Xuzhou. Recently, the heads of the construction departments and technicians of various counties, including Liao Chengzhang of Dangshan, Yuan Fengpan of Xiao County, and He Shiliang of Suining, have been transferred to Xuzhou by the special commissioner to engage in Yellow River flood control technical work. The counties have different views on the locks and dams in Lianjia Dam. The counties to the west of Xuzhou mainly focus on leading the water downstream to prevent backflow in the event of a breach. The counties to the east of Xuzhou mainly focus on preventing the water from flowing east and changing the embankment to cut off its flow. The construction of the Great Embankment of Weishan Lake has left culverts at the river mouths connecting Tong and Pei counties, with locks set up to store and discharge water, not just blocking the water in one way. The Tong County Government convened a meeting with representatives from all sectors yesterday and decided that Liu Xinyuan, head of the construction department, and representatives will go to Lianjia Dam this morning by car to conduct an on-site inspection, assess the situation, and then determine the construction methods. Generally speaking, repairing the dam and setting up the lock to control the opening and closing of the dam, and then dredging the Bulao River after the Yellow River flood control work is completed, is a predetermined and inevitable step, and also a comprehensive plan for water conservancy in northern Tong County. Tongshan is located directly north of Suxian County in Anhui Province. A technician from Suxian County was sent to Xuzhou a few days ago to investigate the Yellow River flooding and expressed sympathy for the Yellow River flood control facilities in the counties under the jurisdiction of Xuzhou and Tongshan. The interests of Xuzhou and Anhui are consistent, and Tong and Su are particularly close, and have decided to assist each other.</p>
<p>Comforting the Residents Building the Embankment</p>
<p>The Tongshan County Party Department and County Government have held several Yellow River flood control meetings and established a Yellow River Flood Control Coordination Association, with committee members from various agencies, construction committees, and local gentry. They have expressed their condolences to the residents building the embankment. A few days ago, the Tong County Party Department collected donations from all sectors and appointed representatives to go to the northern Tongshan and Weishan Lake coast this morning by car to provide comfort. County Magistrate Wang Gongying has been supervising the construction work on the Weishan Lake coast since the construction of the embankment began. After the representatives expressed their condolences, they inspected the Weishan Lake coast. The embankment has completed most of the project. The laborers have been working tirelessly under the scorching sun or in torrential rain. Magistrate Wang's face is covered with dust and his feet are covered in yellow mud. The residents call him the Chief Engineer. It is said that the embankment project can be completed on schedule (25th).</p>

<p>Patrol Police Catch a Criminal Carrying Soil</p>
<p>Ma Wenguang, a detective from the Sixth Police Station of the Xin Zhuang Public Security Bureau, and police officer Wu Xuewen, while patrolling near the east side of the Xin Zhuang train station at around 2:00 a.m. on the 26th, noticed a suspicious pedestrian. When questioned, the person appeared flustered. As the officers attempted to search him, the pedestrian, relying on his strength, tried to punch the officers and escape. Fortunately, the military police stationed at the station heard the commotion and rushed over to help subdue him. They found 27 taels of secretly transported soil from Qia Ji hidden in his belt. He confessed that his name was Zhang Yushan, from Jinan, Shandong Province, and he lived on New Tokyo Road in the British Concession of Shanghai, where he ran the Yi He Da Bing shop. He was traveling to Songjiang to meet a fellow villager who ran a pancake stall there. Also, at around 1:00 p.m. on the 26th, detective Shen Zaihua of the Public Security Bureau saw a well-dressed pedestrian holding a "Beautiful" brand cigarette tin in front of the Quan Da Pawnshop on Dajie. When the pedestrian saw Officer Shen, he entered the pawnshop, arousing suspicion. Upon searching him, they found one tael of smuggled soil and half a tin of cigarette ash in the cigarette tin. Both cases have been handed over to the bureau for investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Suzhou</p>
<p>Merchants Petition Against Store Closures</p>
<p>Shops on Daogian Street and Yangyu Lane in the western part of the city have been greatly affected by the county government's construction of a small vegetable market in the Xiliku area, which forced all vegetable vendors to move into the market. To alleviate the impact, the shops jointly invested in establishing the Minsheng Vegetarian Food Store. However, the county government deemed this to be in violation of vegetable market regulations and sealed the store. The shops staged a strike to protest, but to no avail. Zhang Linsheng, the manager of the Minsheng Vegetarian Food Store, believes that the county government's closure was illegal and has expressed his dissatisfaction. He has submitted a petition to the county Party department seeking relief and also filed an administrative appeal with the provincial government on the 26th.</p>
<p>Provincial Committee Inspects the Demolition of Enclosures in Taihu Lake</p>
<p>The lake fields enclosed by residents from other provinces in Eastern Taihu Lake, located within the borders of Wu County, have been demolished through the joint efforts of the military and civilians. Gu Jiaoruo of the Provincial Committee, together with the Wu County Magistrate and the Nie Detachment Commander, traveled by boat to Eastern Taihu Lake on the 25th to inspect the demolition project. The results of the inspection were very satisfactory. When they returned to the Hengjing District Office at noon that day, hundreds of villagers blocked the road to petition for: (1) the petitioning committee to instruct Wujiang County to demolish all 70 shares of enclosed fields; (2) strict punishment of the 14 rioters who have been apprehended; (3) the dispatch of troops to disperse the residents from other provinces. Committee Member Gu agreed, and the villagers left satisfied. Shortly thereafter, Committee Member Gu notified Xu, the Magistrate of Wujiang County, by telephone to quickly demolish the 70 shares of enclosed fields to appease public opinion. Magistrate Xu replied that he would execute the order after receiving instructions from the province. Committee Member Gu and others returned to Suzhou at around 5:00 p.m. Committee Member Gu went to Wujiang County on the morning of the 26th to discuss the demolition of the 70 shares of enclosed fields with Magistrate Xu. He will return to Suzhou that evening.</p>
<p>Wuxi</p>
<p>Tea Houses Petition to Abolish the Tea Tax</p>
<p>The local Tea House Trade Association has previously submitted requests to the Jiangsu Provincial Tax Supervision Committee and other agencies, seeking the abolition of the tea tax, as they were already bearing four types of taxes: business tax, property tax, tea house tax, and public security license tax. They found the tax burden unbearable. Zhejiang Province abolished the tax in October last year, and Suzhou, Jiading, Nanxiang, and other counties in this province have also abolished it. However, this county is the only one that retains the old tax. Therefore, they have sent another letter to Zhang Peng, a member of the Jiangsu Provincial Tax Supervision Committee, requesting him to make a prompt decision, implement the original intention, alleviate the suffering of the people, and abolish the heavy taxes and abuses.</p>
<p>Changzhou</p>
<p>Case of Rape and Murder Near Banshang</p>
<p>Zhao Jin, a resident of Zhoujiaqiao Village near Banshang Town in the Sixth District of the county, had a son named Fu Lin, aged 28, who worked as a farmer. Several years ago, he married a woman named Zhang through a matchmaker. Zhang was of dissolute nature and had an affair with Zhao Arong, a neighbor. Unfortunately, their secret was discovered by Fu Lin's mother. Wishing to avoid public scandal, she gently tried to persuade them to stop. However, Zhang not only did not repent but also colluded with her lover, Zhao Arong, to beat her mother-in-law severely, pouring urine and feces on her, causing her to die. When her son returned home, she had already passed away. He reported the incident to the Sixth District Office, who then reported it to the local court for investigation. Prosecutor Guan Junjie led officials to the village on the 25th and found that the corpse had injuries all over its body, with clear marks of forceful pressure on the face. He determined that she had been beaten and suffocated to death before her death. The perpetrator, Zhao Arong, had fled. Prosecutor Guan ordered the parties involved and neighbors to report to the court for questioning.</p>

<p>Relief for Farmers in Three Counties on the Zhejiang Border</p>
<p>The people of Longquan, Qingyuan, and Jingning counties in southern Zhejiang Province mostly rely on growing water shield (Gorgon fruit) for a living. In years of good harvest, the total income can be over one million yuan. However, the industry has been declining in recent years. The total winter shield business is less than 300,000. The water shield farmers are unable to continue planting and are seeking to return to their hometowns or even resorting to desperate measures. Chen Shizheng, the Administrative Inspector of the Second Special District, has ordered each county to establish a water shield production cooperative to provide relief, and also formed a general cooperative. They borrowed 90,000 yuan from the banking industry and distributed it to each cooperative. The Department of Finance and Construction submitted a proposal to the provincial government for approval, sending personnel to investigate the situation of the cooperatives and to negotiate loans with the banks in order to maintain the livelihoods of the farmers.</p>
<h3 id="e92">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>To the Editor: I am writing regarding the article "Judge Investigates Corpse-Stealing Case" in the Songjiang News section of your paper on the 24th of this month. I find that the facts are not in accordance with the truth and hereby request a correction as follows. The ownership of the land in question belongs to the Jiazi War Memorial Association, which holds two certificates issued by the Ministry of Finance. Yin Wuben's household owns 7.86 mu, and Zhang Shude's household owns 6.148 mu. It has also been registered with the Songjiang County Government, and there is a record of grain transfer. During the war between Qi and Lu, Songjiang was a strategic location in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and large numbers of troops gathered here. American missionary Bu Huilian maintained local order and provided relief to refugees, which was greatly appreciated by the people of Songjiang. They raised funds to build a pavilion here to commemorate this. This led to the founding of the Association. Later, because the pavilion was too high and was about to collapse, a meeting of directors and supervisors was held at the County Chamber of Commerce on the 22nd of September, 1933. A public discussion was held to rebuild the memorial pavilion and develop a park. The land was leveled and the half of the pavilion was demolished in February of this year. When skeletal remains were discovered, they were immediately reburied. All expenses, in addition to the 120 yuan provided by missionary Bu, were raised by members of the Association. The dismantling of the pavilion was in fact for the purpose of rebuilding it, as can be proven by Missionary Bu. The land is commonly known as Nijiatan, or Huchong, totaling 6.934 mu. The river mud is piled up like a mountain. It is neither a scenic spot in Songjiang nor a place where loyal souls are buried. The county gazetteer clearly states that the righteous soldiers who died during the late Ming Dynasty, including Dai Hong and 30 others, were buried behind the Dacheng Hall of the Confucius Temple in the city. The burial place of the Hong Yang rebel army is not recorded in the gazetteer. Since the Association built the memorial pavilion on this site in 1925, it has been protected by fences and wire mesh. No coffins have ever been buried here. Therefore, the story of the wounded soldiers being buried in 1927 is a fabrication, a distortion of the facts. I urge your newspaper to promptly issue a correction. Tang Zhi, representative of the Songjiang War Memorial Association. July 27th, 1935.</p>

<h3 id="e96">Notice from the Industry and Commerce Loan Association: Review of Credit Loan Applications Begins; Application Forms Delivered to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yesterday for Distribution; National Products Factories Can Obtain and Fill Out Forms from the Chamber; Personnel from Various Banks and Firms Met Yesterday to Discuss Work Assignments <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports: The Municipal Industry and Commerce Small Credit Loan, managed by the Loan Committee, is scheduled to begin processing on August 1. It was also decided that application forms would be sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for distribution. It is learned that the various forms prepared by the Chamber, including the loan application form, application report, balance sheet, profit and loss statement, and a description of the small credit loan, have been printed and were sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce with a letter yesterday for distribution. An official notice was also published to announce the start of the review and lending process. As for the application procedures, they will generally follow the instructions in the description. Details are extracted below:</p>
<p>Notice Regarding Loan Processing</p>
<p>The Loan Committee issued a notice yesterday announcing the commencement of small credit loan lending, stating, "As per the order from the Ministry of Finance promulgating the Detailed Rules for Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loans, we are instructed to comply accordingly. The Detailed Rules stipulate that small credit loans for industry and commerce will be reviewed and lent by this Committee. It is hereby announced that processing will commence on August 1. All loan application forms, application reports, balance sheets, profit and loss statements, and instructions have been sent to the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce for distribution to various trade associations, for applicants within those industries to fill out and submit to this Committee for review. Factories and firms that are not members of trade associations can directly obtain application forms from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and submit them to this Committee for review. Detailed procedures are all contained in the instructions. Applicants should pay special attention to this notice."</p>
<p>Talks Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee, in accordance with Article 10 of the organization charter approved by the Ministry of Finance (this Committee may borrow personnel from related banks and firms to handle investigation and review matters), sent letters to various banks and firms, requesting them to send personnel to participate. To date, over twenty personnel have been sent by various banks and firms. Cai Zengji, Chairman of the Committee, held a discussion meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday at the National Products Bank on the second floor to discuss investigation and review procedures and assign tasks. The meeting lasted for about an hour before adjourning. According to Xin Xin News Agency reporters, the personnel sent by various banks are all volunteers and receive no salary.</p>
<p>Forms Sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>After deciding to commence lending on August 1, the Loan Committee had the drafted loan application forms, application reports, balance sheets, and profit and loss statements printed. A total of over 3,000 copies were sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce with a letter at 2 p.m. yesterday for distribution to various trade associations. The Chamber immediately sent a portion to various trade associations for applicants in those industries to fill out. Factories and firms that are not members of trade associations can directly obtain the forms from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce from today onwards, fill them out according to the various forms, and submit them to the Loan Committee for review.</p>
<p>Description of Credit Loan</p>
<p>Description of the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee's Small Credit Loan: (1) Total amount: 5,000,000 yuan. (2) Requests for credit loans are limited to factories manufacturing national products, businesses selling national products, and those transporting national products for export. (3) In order to ensure that industry and commerce evenly enjoy the benefits of these credit loans, the maximum loan amount is limited to 5,000 yuan. (4) The credit loans are specifically for maintaining production and cannot be used to repay old debts. They cannot be used for speculative ventures or any other improper purposes. Otherwise, once discovered, this Committee will report to the government and prosecute according to the law on embezzlement of public funds. Goods and items purchased with the loans cannot be mortgaged elsewhere. Borrowers should submit monthly expense reports to the Committee for review. (5) Credit loan application forms and other forms will be sent by this Committee to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for distribution to various trade associations, for applicants in those industries to fill out and return to this Committee at the National Products Bank, 2nd floor, at the intersection of Henan Road and Tianjin Road for investigation and review. Factories and firms that are not members of trade associations may also obtain the above forms from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and submit them to this Committee for review. (6) Applicants should fill out the application form, together with guarantees from two reputable firms (if it is a limited liability company, the company manager must provide the guarantee), and a balance sheet and profit and loss statement (these documents must be certified by a CPA, bank, firm, or reputable business). Once approved, the loan will be issued. (7) If the applicant is also a guarantor for other credit loans, the approved loan amount will be calculated by combining the amount guaranteed. For example, if the applicant is qualified for a loan of 10,000 yuan but has a guarantee liability of 3,000 yuan, they can only borrow 7,000 yuan themselves. (8) The Committee incurs substantial expenses in handling loan investigations. Following established practices, applicants will be charged an investigation fee of 2 yuan to cover these costs. This fee should be paid to the Committee when submitting the application form, and a receipt will be issued. If the application is not approved, the fee will be refunded upon presentation of the receipt. (9) Applicants should carefully note all the provisions of the Loan Rules promulgated.

<h3 id="e97">Japanese Commentator Takashige Murofushi's Assertions: Advocates for the Complete Withdrawal of Japanese Military Attaches from China; Japan Should Avoid Aggression, and Only Then Can China and Japan Approach Each Other <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's Japanese Mainichi Shimbun reported that Takashige Murofushi, a prominent contemporary Japanese commentator, departed from Tokyo on the 8th of this month to inspect various parts of North China. After visiting key figures in Nanjing, he arrived in Shanghai on the 23rd. On the 24th, Japanese reporters visited him at the Towa Hotel. He frankly expressed his views on Sino-Japanese relations, Japan's attitude towards China, and the mission of the Japanese people, as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Regarding the "Shinsei" Disrespect Incident: Articles disrespectful to Japan are not unique to China; they are frequently seen in other foreign countries as well. However, singling out China, whose military and national strength is weaker than Japan's, and making a big fuss over it is not the attitude of a great nation. If China is oppressed over every trivial matter, there will be no hope for adjusting Sino-Japanese relations.</p>
<p>(2) Regarding China's Anti-Japanese Movement: After Japan caused the Manchurian and Shanghai incidents, the demand that China prohibit the anti-Japanese movement should first examine the reasons for the previous anti-Japanese sentiment. Chinese people, in terms of national sentiment, have historically never had any reason to oppose Japan. After the anti-British movement broke out in the past, it gradually diminished due to the skillful policies of the British. Later, they gradually developed a dislike for Japanese imperialism, and a segment of the population wantonly engaged in anti-Japanese activities. However, if Japan had no reason to incite the emotions of the Chinese people, even if a portion instigated the entire nation, would they all follow suit?</p>
<p>(3) Regarding His Views on Chiang and Wang: The world considers Chiang and Wang not to be absolute power holders, which is a fundamental misconception. In reality, Chiang and Wang are great figures representing the civil and military aspects of China.</p>
<p>(4) Japan's Attitude Towards China: Japan, with the Imperial Way as its foundation, is at a time of great development. However, Japan must not adopt the aggressive policies of the 19th-century European and American powers. It should establish itself openly and uprightly, uphold justice, and soldiers must have the attitude of soldiers, properly fulfilling their shared responsibilities. Some have said that Manchuria is a "paradise" for independent states, but is this really the case? If Manchuria is an independent state, then suppressing bandits should be left entirely to the Manchurians. Japan should not sacrifice its own lives to maintain the security of other countries. Furthermore, in China, using means other than diplomatic channels to pressure the National Government and the Kuomintang is a fundamentally wrong policy. In my opinion (Murofushi stated), in order to adjust Sino-Japanese relations, all Japanese military attaches stationed in China should be withdrawn, leaving no one behind. At the same time, the strength of the Kwantung Army should be reduced by one-tenth.</p>
<p>(5) Criticism of Japanese Military's Infringement on Authority: Soldiers should handle direct issues fairly and openly, and should not fabricate or invent things. The Japanese military has repeatedly infringed on authority. For example, the disturbances in Manchuria and Shanghai are not called "wars" but "incidents," because incidents do not require the approval of the Diet or the deliberations of the Privy Council. In reality, so-called incidents are wars, carried out solely based on the intentions of the military, which is an infringement on authority. Therefore, in my humble opinion, focusing solely on small matters lacking transparency causes me great concern for the future of Japan.</p>
<p>Translator's note: Takashige Murofushi is a leading figure in the Japanese commentary world, with extensive writings and familiarity with the situation in China. He was commissioned by the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun to come to China to observe the actual situation. His sharp pen and precise insights are admired throughout Japan. It is said that he has written a systematic "China Travelogue" about his travels in China, which will be published daily in the Yomiuri Shimbun. Once the newspaper arrives, more will be translated.</p>

<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports: The national gold and silver import and export situation for the first half of this year shows that silver outflow has decreased, with a trade deficit of nearly 6 million yuan. The gold trade surplus has also decreased compared to the same period last year. According to detailed statistics obtained by Shen Shi News Agency reporters, the national silver imports for the first half of the year totaled 2,925,000 yuan from Great Britain, 5,556,208 yuan from Hong Kong, 52,899 yuan from Japan, and 244,353 yuan from other countries, totaling 8,778,460 yuan (national currency). This is an increase of over 2 million compared to the import figure of 6,071,539 yuan for the same period last year. On the export side, 33,787 yuan were shipped to Annam, 1,967,050 yuan to Hong Kong, 707,080 yuan to Japan, and 54,320 yuan to the United States, totaling 2,862,237 yuan (national currency). This is a decrease of far more than 14 times compared to the export figure of 14,271,597 yuan for the same period last year. The silver trade deficit for the first half of the year was 5,916,223 yuan. Regarding gold imports and exports, the national imports for the first half of this year totaled 112,117 Customs Gold Units, an increase of over 100,000 Customs Gold Units compared to the import figure of 5,856 units for the same period last year. Gold exports totaled 13,969,110 Customs Gold Units, a decrease of over 4 million Customs Gold Units compared to the export figure of 18,175,344 units for the same period last year. The trade surplus for this year was 11,856,993 Customs Gold Units, a decrease of several million yuan compared to the surplus for the same period last year. In June alone, the gold trade surplus was 23,990 Customs Gold Units, and the silver trade surplus was 48,058 yuan (national currency). Therefore, the gold and silver trade situation this year is much better than last year.</p>

<p>Since the occurrence of floods in various provinces and the displacement of disaster victims, all sectors of the city have begun to discuss disaster relief measures. It is reported that the municipal government, in order to concentrate efforts, will have the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau draft a plan to assist and coordinate with various sectors in organizing relief efforts in the disaster areas. However, all measures are pending the return of Xu Shiying, Chairman of the Disaster Relief Committee, to Shanghai for an exchange of views before they can be implemented. According to sources from the Disaster Relief Committee, Chairman Xu has arrived in Nanchang and, after a brief stay, will proceed to Nanjing before returning to Shanghai. Joint efforts will be launched as soon as Chairman Xu arrives in Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e100">National Grain Imports Exceed 100 Million Yuan in the First Half of This Year; Account for Over One-Fifth of Total Imports for the Half-Year; Sharp Increase in Rice Imports; Significant Value of Wheat Imports <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>Shen Shi News Agency reports: Our country is based on agriculture, but in recent years, the import of foreign grains has increased. Last year, due to drought in various provinces, our agricultural products were greatly reduced. This year, not only is foreign rice being imported in large quantities, but wheat imports are also considerable. Grain imports, including other miscellaneous grains, have reached over 100 million yuan in the first half of the year, accounting for one-fifth of the total imports for the half-year. Shen Shi News Agency reporters learned the following details from the Customs Office yesterday:</p>
<p>Rice Imports Exceed 70 Million</p>
<p>In the first half of the year, the national import of foreign rice totaled over 11 million metric tons, valued at over 75 million yuan (national currency). This included 8,093,627 Customs Gold Units from India, 25,074,763 Customs Gold Units from Annam, 100,511 Customs Gold Units from Hong Kong, 47,297 Customs Gold Units from Japan, 10,046,107 Customs Gold Units from Siam, 4,246 Customs Gold Units from Singapore, 31,047 Customs Gold Units from Dalian (Japanese rice), and 51,051 Customs Gold Units from other countries, totaling 43,359,190 Customs Gold Units, equivalent to 75,672,815 yuan (national currency). This is an increase of almost double compared to the import figure of 40,733,423 yuan for the same period last year and ranks first among foreign goods imported in the first half of the year.</p>
<p>Wheat Imports Also Show a Sharp Increase</p>
<p>In the first half of this year, not only were national rice imports huge, but wheat imports were also considerable. During the half-year, 1,054,156 metric tons were shipped from Argentina, valued at 3,752,863 Customs Gold Units; 3,299,795 metric tons from Australia, valued at 12,688,175 Customs Gold Units; 10,124 metric tons from Canada, valued at 47,748 Customs Gold Units; 48,281 metric tons from the United States, valued at 196,310 Customs Gold Units; and 28,099 metric tons from other countries, valued at 97,933 Customs Gold Units. In total, wheat imports amounted to 4,440,455 metric tons, valued at 16,783,029 Customs Gold Units, equivalent to 29,428,110 yuan (national currency). This is also an increase compared to the import figure of 15,194,783 Customs Gold Units for the same period last year.</p>
<p>Miscellaneous Grain Imports: The Total Value is Alarming</p>
<p>In addition to the large imports of foreign rice and wheat, this year's imports of other miscellaneous grains included 1,200,695 Customs Gold Units for bran, 171,408 Customs Gold Units for unnamed miscellaneous grains, 111,337 Customs Gold Units for sago, 1,863,097 Customs Gold Units for wheat flour, and 352,605 Customs Gold Units for unnamed miscellaneous grain flour. Including rice and wheat, the total value reached 63,841,361 Customs Gold Units, equivalent to 111,166,3759 yuan (national currency). This accounts for over one-fifth of the total value of foreign trade imports for the first half of this year, a truly alarming figure.</p>

<p>Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, recorder Zhu Guilin, master of ceremonies Tan Fengyan, and receptionists Wang Gang, Zhang Zhenyuan, Nie Haifan, Zheng Gongbi, and Xie Chenghsun, after performing the customary formalities, Yu Zuoting first delivered the opening remarks, saying, "Today, our Chamber of Commerce is convening everyone here because the municipal government has announced the implementation measures for workers' literacy education, ordering all factories to establish workers' literacy schools within a prescribed period. Our Chamber of Commerce has specifically convened representatives from various factories to comply with the government's orders and establish workers' literacy schools within the deadline. We have also invited Director Pan Gongzhan of the Education Bureau, Lu Jingshi of the Municipal Party Committee, Jiang Jianbai of the Literacy Education Committee, and Wu Huanru, Section Chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, to provide guidance," and so on.</p>
<p>Report on Implementation Measures</p>
<p>Following this, Jiang Jianbai reported on the methods for workers' literacy education, saying, "After Shanghai launched the literacy movement, and having established workers' literacy education measures, all illiterate workers within the city's boundaries must receive literacy education. Workers who are required to receive literacy education must, after receiving the enrollment notice from the literacy school or workers' school, if they delay or fail to enroll without reason, be subject to a fine of one dime to five yuan, or two hours to five days of labor service, in addition to being ordered to enroll within a prescribed period. The same applies to those who are absent from classes without reason. Workers who are required to receive literacy education, if they still have not received literacy education by July 1, 1936, will be ordered to stop working immediately until they have completed their literacy education, at which point they will be allowed to resume work. Factories, companies, shops, etc., that employ workers and staff who are required to receive literacy education, when they have 30 or more such individuals, should establish workers' literacy schools to conduct worker literacy education. When they have fewer than 30, their literacy education will be handled by the municipal literacy schools. The expenses of the schools will be borne by the respective factories, companies, shops, etc. If it is inconvenient to establish their own workers' literacy school, they may, depending on the number of illiterate workers, pay a fee of one yuan per person and request the Municipal Literacy Education Committee to handle it on their behalf. Factories, companies, shops, etc., that should establish workers' literacy schools, in any of the following circumstances, will be subject to a fine of up to 100 yuan, and will also be ordered to comply within a prescribed period: (A) failing to establish a workers' literacy school by August 31, 1935; (B) failing to ensure that all workers and staff who are required to receive literacy education have completed their literacy education by July 1, 1936. All factories, companies, shops, etc., within the city should conduct their own survey of the literacy and illiteracy status of their employed workers, including staff: (A) Those who have graduated from people's schools or other equivalent schools and hold relevant diplomas should submit the names of these workers and their graduation certificates to the district office of the Shanghai Municipal Literacy Education Committee. After verification by the district office, they will be recognized as literate workers and exempt from literacy education. (B) Those who can recognize the 600 characters stipulated by the Shanghai Municipal Literacy Education Committee should submit a list of these workers to the district office of the Shanghai Municipal Literacy Education Committee. After passing a periodic examination conducted by the district office, they will also be recognized as literate workers and exempt from literacy education. (C) Workers who do not fall into categories A or B will be considered illiterate workers and must receive literacy education. Workers' literacy schools should have a standard class size of 50 people, with men and women taught in separate classes as a matter of principle, according to the number of illiterate workers and the financial situation of the respective factories, companies, shops, etc. However, at least one class must be established before August 31, 1935, and the literacy education of all workers required to receive literacy education must be completed before June 30, 1936. Each class should have a standard teaching time of one hour per day. In special circumstances, with the approval of the district office of the Municipal Literacy Education Committee, this may be increased or decreased as appropriate. The best time for classes each day is before work in the morning, followed by after work at noon and before work in the afternoon. Except in cases of absolute necessity, classes should not be held after work in the afternoon. For those who work ten hours or less per day, class time may be outside of work hours. For those who work more than ten hours, class time should be within work hours. The duration of study should generally be two months. In special circumstances, with the approval of the district office of the Municipal Literacy Education Committee, the duration of study may be shortened or extended as appropriate. Budget standards, assuming the establishment of two workers' literacy school classes, the budget for start-up costs and monthly recurring expenses: (A) Start-up costs: eight yuan; (1) one large blackboard: five yuan; (2) one handbell: one yuan; (3) other (such as stationery for teachers): two yuan; (B) Recurring expenses: twenty-two yuan per month; (1) teacher's salary: fifteen yuan per month; (2) student stationery costs: five yuan per month; (3) miscellaneous expenses: one yuan per month; (4) school worker's allowance: one yuan per month. Preparatory steps: Factories, companies, shops, etc., establishing workers' literacy schools may follow the following steps: (1) determine the budget; (2) decide on the number of classes to establish; (3) appoint a teacher to be responsible for preparation; (4) select a school site and arrange the classroom; (5) determine the opening date; (6) submit a report on the opening; (7) open the school; (8) apply for registration. Within one week of opening, fill out the registration form and student roster in duplicate and request registration from the district office and the Chamber of Commerce." The speeches from Director Pan and Wu Yun-Chu are omitted here.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Tan Zhen Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday to Discuss Publication Law and the Judiciary; Emphasis on the First Instance After Implementing the Three-Tier, Three-Trial System <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Tan Zhen, Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, arrived in Shanghai at the invitation of Central Committee Member Li Shizeng to prepare the Huang Keqiang Memorial Room for the martyrs. Tan arrived in port yesterday morning at 7:15 am by overnight train from Beijing and went to rest in a mansion in West Shanghai. A reporter from Riri News made a special visit to interview him, asking about the revised publication law. After it was passed by the Legislative Yuan, the national press felt that the implementation of the new law would be extremely difficult, and many telegrams were sent to the central government requesting reconsideration. Tan's opinion on this was very detailed, and he also discussed the problems of rectifying the national judiciary. The following is a detailed record:</p>
<p>Opinions on the Revised New Publication Law</p>
<p>Tan first spoke about the content of the revised publication law passed by the Legislative Yuan, saying, "I believe that the law itself does not have many flaws. However, the implementation of national laws seeks to be applicable. If the implementation of the law causes obstacles in society, it will violate the purpose of legislation and should be modified. Therefore, this issue needs to be studied. I think the three standards for banning publications passed by the Central Political Council this time are very appropriate."</p>
<p>Views on Private Matters</p>
<p>Regarding the section prohibiting the publication of personal and family private matters, the so-called private matters do not have a fixed scope, but should be interpreted as matters related to morality that do not need to be disclosed. Otherwise, there will be no restrictions. In the future, there will be a certain scope of regulations. Legislators intend to balance the legal interests of society and individuals. All countries in Europe and the United States have similar laws. However, due to different customs, the regulations are different. Some people in the press believe that the publication law is specially aimed at the suppression of the news industry, which is not necessarily the case.</p>
<p>Judicial Conference Will Not Be Postponed</p>
<p>The National Judicial Conference is scheduled to be held on September 16 and will open on schedule without delay. Most of the preparations have been completed. At that time, presidents of courts at all levels in each province, chief prosecutors, and representatives of judges and prosecutors should attend the meeting in Beijing. In addition, representatives of the National Lawyers Association can attend six people according to the regulations.</p>
<p>Rectify the Judiciary, Focus on the First Instance</p>
<p>After the implementation of the three-tier, three-trial system, local courts in various places feel the lack of judicial funds and talents. The judicial authorities are paying close attention to this because the first instance is extremely important. The facts and evidence of all lawsuits can be investigated by the trial court. In the past, the primary courts often did not seriously deal with cases because of the lack of talent and many cases, resulting in congestion in the second and third instances, which had a great impact. The implementation of the three-tier, three-trial system is intended to rectify the first instance.</p>
<p>Decision to Stop the Inspection in the North</p>
<p>I originally planned to go north to inspect the judiciary in North China after returning from Europe. However, due to busy official duties, it was postponed again and again and has not been completed. Now, Wang Yongbin, Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, is scheduled to depart from Beijing on the 27th (today) to inspect the judiciaries in the provinces of Hebei, Tianjin, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, Suiyuan, Shanxi, and Shaanxi. I don’t need to go now.</p>
<p>Preparing Huang Keqiang Memorial Room</p>
<p>Tan finally said that I came here at the invitation of Mr. Li Shizeng of the Central Committee. Li is currently staying at the World Society on Foch Road. The house was formerly the residence of martyr Huang Keqiang, and Huang died there. Now, he wants to open a memorial room in this house to commemorate his immortality. Mr. Li specially invited me here to discuss everything, and there are no other tasks. I plan to return to Beijing the day after tomorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e103">New Initiatives of the Local Court; President Luo Rectifies Court Affairs <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Since taking office, Luo Tong, president of the Shanghai Local Court, has devoted himself to court affairs and carefully planned them. Recently, from July to August of this year, court has opened at 7:00 am every morning to hear various cases, but the parties involved often do not report on time, so it is announced that the parties must not delay any longer. In addition, those who attend the hearing of the case must first obtain an audience permit before they are allowed to sit in the audience. People who are not involved in the case are not allowed to enter or stay. Secretary-General Xu Bentang is entrusted to inspect each court at any time. Recently, the road in front of the court gate has been repaired by craftsmen and was completed yesterday. Trees have also been planted along the walls to enhance the appearance, so the atmosphere has been renewed.</p>
<h3 id="e104">Postmaster General Chaphekar; Improving Postal Delivery Methods; Hoping That Senders and Receivers Will Pay Attention <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Shanghai Postal District Postmaster General Chaphekar sent a letter to this newspaper yesterday, saying, "To the editor: Our Postmaster General would like to say a few words to all Shanghai residents, that is, the employers of the post office. Would your newspaper please sacrifice its precious space to publish them so that readers may be slightly helped in sending and receiving mail. It should be remembered that the public's desire for the improvement of the local post office is the same as what our Postmaster General hopes for. The bureau is working hard to reform and will not slack off. If our customers can fully cooperate, the effect will be even more considerable. Looking at various countries around the world, the public in cities similar to Shanghai seems to be less concerned about their mail than the people in Shanghai. The people of Shanghai not only regard changing addresses as commonplace, but also believe that whether or not the post office has been notified of the new address, or whether there are errors or incompleteness in the name, address, and house number on the mail, the mail will definitely arrive. This is probably due to their trust in the post office. A few years ago, Shanghai was smaller, and this could be done. Now, even if there are several possibilities, all sectors must know that since the city has expanded, the scope has become very broad. To ensure timely and accurate delivery of mail, the following points are necessary: 1. The name and address of the recipient (such as street name and house number, etc.) should be written as clearly as possible. 2. If residing in a one-story or rented group of houses, the floor or group in which the recipient lives should also be indicated. 3. If in a lane, the lane number and house number should be indicated together. 4. If the name and address on the mail are written in a foreign language, it would be helpful to add the street name and house number in Chinese, as this will speed up delivery. All such mail must be translated into Chinese before delivery and then sent to the mail carrier, which is time-consuming and inevitably hinders delivery. 5. Each household should install a mailbox or door slot of appropriate size at the entrance, where the mail carrier can easily reach it. Those residing in a one-story or rented group of houses should also install a mailbox at a suitable location at the entrance or in the hallway. These mailboxes are necessary and not only ensure accurate delivery and reduce errors and losses but also protect the mail. The post office's promotion of this method is not to force the public to send mail in this way. It is hoped that it will benefit both the mail carriers and the public. In the future, due to the trend of the times, it is possible that all mail may be stopped delivery to those who have not installed these mailboxes or door slots. 6. Mail carriers are strictly prohibited from delivering mail to the back door. 7. If a registered letter is delivered, the person responsible for receiving it should immediately sign a receipt as quickly as possible, as there are others who are eagerly waiting for their mail. No matter how loyal servants are, please do not trust them too much, as they may forget sometimes. Therefore, all mail for a certain person, no matter how the address is written, must be entrusted to the responsible person for proper receipt. If this is done, even if the recipient is out, the mail will eventually be delivered to the recipient intact. It should be known that once the mail has been delivered according to the address written on it, the post office's responsibility ends. 8. Those who often change addresses should rent a private mailbox at the post office to have a fixed address so that their mail will not fall into the hands of bad people. The post office only accepts and registers applications for changing addresses. If any accidents occur, the seller must bear the responsibility themselves, and the post office will not be liable for any responsibility. 9. Please do not argue with the mail carrier. Most mail carriers are well-intentioned, but misunderstandings often occur due to differences in dialect. If there are any difficulties, please report the details to the Postmaster General, who will immediately pay attention. Sending mail according to the following methods can also be of great benefit: 1. The name and address written on the mail must be clear and correct. 2. The stationery used must be good, especially the envelope. Cheap envelopes cannot withstand long-distance transportation, resulting in a large number of letters that cannot be delivered even with the best efforts of the post office's delivery staff. All seals should be properly glued and tightly sealed to prevent private opening. It should be known that private opening of mail does not occur in the post office but mostly outside the post office. 3. Please avoid entrusting others to send mail as much as possible. The trusted friend may be forgetful and leave the letter in his pocket for a long time before sending it. Even the most loyal servants often make mistakes, especially when the mail does not require a receipt from the post office to prove that it has been sent. For the sake of prudence, it is better to purchase some stamps in advance for use at any time. When sending mail, stick the stamps yourself and put them in the postal mailbox collected by the mail carrier, or send them directly to the post offices located throughout the city, which is more appropriate. If the public can follow the above points, the post office will receive great help, and all facilities will be able to better satisfy customers. We have long admired your newspaper's enthusiasm for public welfare, so we have sent this letter. We hope you will agree to publish it. Thank you very much. Sincerely, The Editor of Shen Bao, Shanghai Postal District Postmaster General Chaphekar, July 26, 1935, Republic of China.</p>

<p>The Chang An, a ship of the Liji Shipping Company in Shanghai, runs on the route from Shanghai to Xinghua, Quanzhou, Fujian. This time, when sailing from Shanghai to Quanzhou, it hit a reef by mistake when it was about to reach the sea off Fuzhou. The bottom of the ship collided, but it was fortunate enough to escape by itself. Fearing danger at the time, the shipowner telegraphed the company and ordered it to return to Shanghai immediately to check the extent of the damage and then decide on a repair plan. The company also reported this to the Maritime Administration and the China Ship Insurance Association for notification. The ship returned to Shanghai yesterday and sailed to the Gaochangmiao Jiangnan Shipyard to enter the dock to check the extent of the damage for repairs. The Insurance Association also sent ship surveyors to conduct a joint survey.</p>
<h3 id="e107">Committee for the Revival of Industry and Commerce; Approved the Training Program; Establishing Training Classes and Holding Lectures; Paying Attention to Accounting Management and Sales <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Since its establishment, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce's Committee for the Revival of Industry and Commerce has begun to work in groups. The Investigation Group has been researching and studying the procedures for conducting investigation work by jointly inviting experts and leaders from various industries to meet and discuss with the director and deputy director of the group, Xi Yushu and Xu Xiaochu, and the director and deputy director of each group every day. The Training Group also held its first meeting at 4:00 pm the day before yesterday. It was convened by Luo Qinghua, Director of the Group. Xu Xiaochu, Xi Yushu, Pan Xulun, Luo Qinghua, Zheng Chengqing, and Ren Jinpin attended. The meeting was chaired by Luo Qinghua and Ren Jinpin served as the recorder. First, Ren Jinpin read aloud the original text of the training program proposed by Luo Qinghua and Pan Yangyao, and then submitted the original proposal for discussion. In addition to passing the principles, the following five items were also resolved: (1) In addition to establishing training classes, two lectures will be held each month, and another method of communication will be formulated. (2) To enable the industrial and commercial circles to deeply understand the importance of accounting, industrial and commercial management, and commodity sales, the director of the group will invite experts to put forward important outlines and compile small booklets for training and publicity. (3) It is recommended that Pan Xulun and Xi Yushu be responsible for planning the compilation of booklets on accounting issues. (4) It is recommended that Pan Yangyao contact the Industrial and Commercial Management Society to discuss the compilation of booklets on commodity sales issues. (5) It is recommended that Luo Qinghua and Pan Yangyao discuss the compilation of booklets on commodity sales issues. The training group's work plan that was passed is recorded below: (Work Plan) The preliminary cause of this committee is investigation, and the basic work is training. There are thousands of aspects to training problems. It should be suitable for the purpose of the industrial and commercial circles. Like treating a disease, investigation work is diagnosis, and training work is a prescription. At present, observing the difficult situations of various factories, although the reasons are different, the main points are that accounting is chaotic, management is lax, and sales are weak, which seem to be the biggest problems. The work of this group is based on this strategy. The outline is as follows: (1) Organize research classes. This group intends to invite experts to provide practical guidance and open the following three classes: (A) Accounting Research Class, (B) Industrial and Commercial Management Research Class, (C) Commodity Sales Research Class. The above three items seem to be essential subjects at present. Using the spare time of the industrial and commercial circles, this committee will notify industrial and commercial firms in various industries to send personnel in charge of accounting management and sales to come to the meeting for research. Each class will have two lessons per week, each lesson lasting about 2 hours. A small fee will be charged for the handouts. The research period is three months for each subject. The teachers will be given a small travel allowance. Each class will start with 30 students. If there are too many students, they will be divided into classes for research. (2) Specially appointed experts provide on-site guidance. Opening classes for training is very beneficial to industrial and commercial employees. However, the nature of each industry and each factory is different, and the environments are different. In many places, it is necessary to have technical experts to provide on-site guidance and improvement. After investigation and research, this committee should recruit experts to be available for various industries and factories to invite to provide guidance at any time, especially in the following talents. Special appointments should be made first so that they can be consulted at any time: (A) Mechanical aspects, (B) Architectural aspects, (C) Chemical industry aspects, (D) Accounting aspects, (E) Management and organization aspects. (3) Train the staff of this committee. The staff of each group of this committee has close relationships with various industrial and commercial industries. All work has the need for contact. Self-importance and self-reliance are likely to spoil things, and perfunctory treatment is also contrary to the purpose of the establishment of this committee. Therefore, this group should also formulate methods for training the work of this committee and hand them over to this group for training to achieve perfection. In addition, for the training plans of various factories, employee management methods, and plans to improve the intelligence of service personnel, they should be implemented in order of priority, step by step, etc.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County Government received instructions from the Jiangsu Department of Finance to handle unclaimed land, supplement grain, and upgrade the land tax, which must be completed by the end of 1935. In addition to ordering the chiefs of districts, townships, and villages to supervise and check the work, the county government has now set October 14 as the deadline for implementation of the cleaning up. Yesterday, a notice was posted to the public, urging anyone who has concealed grain or unclaimed land to report to the county government within the deadline. At the same time, instructions were given to the director of the land tax collection office to thoroughly investigate the old unclaimed land areas that had been removed from the county in the past, and to prepare a list of unclaimed land based on the old grain collection register, and submit it for verification.</p>

<p>The Cao E Filial Daughter Temple, destroyed by fire in 1929, had stood for approximately two thousand years since its establishment in the first year of the Yuanjia era of the Later Han Dynasty. The enduring faith of people from far and wide demonstrates that her extraordinary filial piety is eternally immortal. Successive dynasties, Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing, all praised her, benefiting the moral fabric of society. Prominent figures Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Zhang Xuanchu, Jiang Weiguo, Ren Fengkui, Zhang Deyi, and others, recognizing this, initiated fundraising for reconstruction. Three years have passed, but due to the economic downturn, the donations have been meager, falling short of the substantial amount of fifty to sixty thousand yuan. It is said that loans were taken out to construct the temple, and the initiators will further solicit donations in the future. It is reported that the main hall's ridge beam will be installed on August 1st, and Wang Xiaolai, Zhang Deyi, Ren Fengkui, He Zhongxiao, Pei Yunqing, and others plan to inspect the construction.</p>

<p>The Old North Gate Police Station, acting on a tip, raided No. 8 Ren'an Lane in Nine Acres, where a large-scale opium den was operating, selling opium and providing beds for smoking. Police Chief Shen, considering the current strict opium prohibition, deemed the unrecorded opium den a blatant disregard for the law. He secretly dispatched Inspector Xu Wenrui, along with Sergeant Gao Kui and other officers, to the premises at 9 PM the night before. They arrested twenty-five opium addicts, including Lü Ziying, Yao Genfa, Zhou Lifang, Tang Lianchi, Wang Asan, Zhang Zhongren, and seized four opium pipes, five opium lamps, and a large amount of other opium paraphernalia. All were taken to the station for investigation. According to Chief Shen's interrogation, the defendants' testimonies were evasive, denying being the den owner. The case, involving the strict opium prohibition, has been referred to the General Bureau for legal action.</p>

<p>Doris Duke, the world's wealthiest American heiress, and her newlywed husband, Mr. Cromwel, are touring the world. After arriving in Hong Kong, they visited Guangzhou. Originally planning to take a China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) plane north to Shanghai, they have temporarily changed their plans and will now travel by sea on the Changxing Company's Empress of Asia liner. It is understood that the liner is scheduled to arrive at 1:00 PM on the 28th. According to CNAC sources, the previous northbound plane only flew to Shantou due to fog and, due to scheduling issues, went directly north from Shantou. If it did not arrive in Shanghai last night, it is expected to arrive this morning. Therefore, Doris Duke changed her plans, traveling by train from Guangzhou to Hong Kong and then by ship to Shanghai.</p>

<p>Xu Heshang, a local resident, aged 44, lived at No. 8, Lane 310, Tangshan Road. He was a peddler. On the morning of the 17th of this month, at around 8 AM, he went to the Tongzhou Road vegetable market to buy vegetables and returned home. Passing by the Fuxingguan Congee Shop at No. 643 East Xihua Road, he saw a shaved ice stall run by Lu Axiao, a native of Nanxiang. Because of the hot weather and dry mouth, he ordered a cup of shaved ice for six copper coins. After finishing it, he forgot to pay, leading to an argument with Lu Axiao, which escalated into a fight. As a result, Xu suffered chest injuries and fell to the ground. The congee shop owner, Yang Xizeng from Zhenjiang, and the shop assistant, Liu Changlin from Yangzhou, intervened to stop the fight. Xu returned home and felt a slight pain in his chest. Two friends, Zhang Awei, went to the ice stall to negotiate with Lu, paying ten foreign triangular copper coins. Liu Changlin bought medicine on their behalf and gave it to Xu, who felt a little better. The next morning, Xu went to the South City to sell watermelons but suddenly felt pain under his chest again. He returned home and went to bed. At 1 PM in the afternoon, he suddenly died. Someone reported it to the Jiaxing Road Police Station, which sent detective Jin Yangwu to investigate. The body was taken to the forensic examination office on Pelleng Road, where prosecutor Guo Wei from the First Special District Court conducted an examination. Because Xu's injuries were internal, a forensic autopsy revealed that two ribs on the lower left chest were broken. He had a pre-existing lung condition. Lu Axiao was sent to the court for interrogation and detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi from the Third Criminal Court conducted a hearing. The Public Works Department's lawyer, Wang Yaotang, stated that according to the forensic examination, although the deceased had a lung condition, the cause of death was the broken ribs. After deliberation, according to the testimonies of Yang Xizeng, Liu Changlin, Zhang Awei, and Xu's wife, Zhang, about the incident, and the report, the judge determined that because the deceased did not pay for the shaved ice and cursed at the shop owner, who tried to slap him but failed. He then hit the shop owner, who resisted and pushed him, causing him to fall to the ground and hit an electric pole, breaking his ribs. Judge Jiang sentenced Lu Axiao to three years and six months of imprisonment, with two days of pre-trial detention counting as one day of imprisonment.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Money Exchange Shop Sues for Recovery of Share Capital; Hearing Concluded, Sentence to Be Announced Next Wednesday <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>The Rongkang Money Exchange in Tongji Lane, Tianjin Road, has been operating for many years. The shop's capital totaled 300,000 yuan, divided into ten shares, each worth 30,000 yuan, subscribed to by Sun Zhizhai, Wang Xiancheng, Xi Qisheng, and others as shareholders. In the winter of last year, some shareholders, including Gu Liancheng, had no intention of continuing the business. They planned to reorganize Rongkang Money Exchange into Rongkang Fengji Money Exchange and recruit new shares. The old Rongkang shareholders would subscribe to six shares, totaling 180,000 yuan, and four new shares would be recruited to facilitate the name change and business.</p>
<p>Among the new shareholders, a Russian doctor, Ding Jiwan, subscribed to one share. Another one-quarter share under Ding's name, worth 7,500 yuan, was attached by Dr. Zhu Xiangshan (aka Zhu Ziyun). Therefore, Ding issued a formal receipt. Although all the share capital for Rongkang Fengji Money Exchange had been collected, Rongkang Money Exchange, affected by the economic downturn, suddenly announced its closure on January 30th of this year, engaging a lawyer for formal liquidation. This affected Fengji Exchange,</p>
<p>preventing its official opening. The collected share capital could not be repaid immediately. Recently, Zhu Ziyun, whose share was attached to Ding Jiwan, engaged lawyer Lu Qijin and filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court, accusing Rongkang Exchange's manager, Xi Qisheng, assistant manager, Qin Guangzhao, and associate, Zhu Pinsheng, of jointly breaching trust and embezzling the 7,500 yuan share capital. Ding Jiwan was also listed as a person of interest. The Special Court</p>
<p>had summoned them once, but because the defendants did not appear, the hearing was rescheduled. All details were recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Zhaoting continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Court. The three defendants also arrived with their defense lawyer, Yuan Hanyun. Complainant Zhu Ziyun stated that in the winter of last year, he met Xi and Qin at Ding Jiwan's place. They solicited him to become a shareholder in Rongkang Fengji Money Exchange. Seeing that Ding had already joined, he agreed. The 7,500 yuan share capital was attached to Ding's name. At that time, Ding</p>
<p>issued a receipt, which was written by Xi and signed by Ding. He then gave Rongkang promissory notes to Xi and Qin. All share capital was claimed to have been fully collected and deposited in the Fuyuan and Anyu money shops. Unexpectedly, Xi and others later transferred the share capital to Rongkang Money Exchange, leading to its collapse. Rongkang Fengji Money Exchange also did not open. The defendants' actions constituted embezzlement and should be prosecuted. Xi Qisheng and others stated that they were the</p>
<p>Rongkang manager. Because Rongkang shareholder She Biancheng had no intention of continuing the business, they initiated a reorganization, adding Fengji to the name. The old Rongkang shareholders subscribed to 180,000 yuan, and Yu Zhendong, Lu Shaotang, Ding Jiwan, and others joined as new shareholders. Ding subscribed to one share, totaling 30,000 yuan. Complainant Zhu Ziyun was Ding's attached share, an undisclosed partner. The total capital of 300,000 yuan had been fully collected and initially deposited in the Fuyuan and Anyu money shops. But because Fengji Exchange was a reorganization of Rongkang,</p>
<p>all share capital should be transferred to Rongkang. This could be verified with the Money Exchange Association, as it was a common practice. Rongkang announced its liquidation on January 30th of this year. All the old Rongkang shareholders of Fengji expressed their willingness to repay the share capital, but it was only a matter of time. This case was entirely within the scope of civil matters. According to regulations, the complainant should negotiate with Ding Jiwan, who should then file a civil lawsuit against the defendants, which would be the proper course of action. It was inappropriate to rashly file a criminal lawsuit. After the lawyers for both sides argued, the court announced that the case would be adjourned and a sentence would be announced next Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Rickshaw Merchants Submit Opinions in Letter; Taxpayer Association Forwards to Public Works Department for Correction on Two Points <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Lu Dexing, Gu Songmao, Zhang Jingbo, Wang Runling, and five hundred other representatives of Shanghai's public rickshaw merchants, wrote to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, stating: "We respectfully submit that since the Public Works Department's Vehicle Committee ordered the public rickshaws to adopt the new style, we rickshaw merchants have experienced hardship for years. The results have shown only disadvantages, with no benefits. As taxpayers, we respectfully bring this to your esteemed association's attention to protect taxpayers' interests and request your association to urge the Public Works Department to promptly make corrections to alleviate the merchants' difficulties. We present the two most important points below: (1) Vehicle style: The existing vehicle style adopted by us rickshaw merchants has been in use for twenty years. Both the riders and pullers find it satisfactory. The evolution of this style involved iron-clad wheels, then solid rubber wheels. With the advancement of transportation and the widespread installation of tram tracks on the roads, to avoid the wheels getting caught in the tracks and causing accidents, they were universally changed to inflatable rubber tires, which have been in use ever since without incident. The road traffic conditions today are the same as before, yet the Public Works Department suddenly issued an order for a so-called new style rickshaw, seemingly enforcing it mandatorily. To promote the new style, the Public Works Department is willing to increase the taxpayers' burden by 40,000 yuan annually, establishing a Vehicle Committee to oversee it. The committee was originally intended to last for eight months, but now it seems to be established permanently and unconditionally, further increasing the taxpayers' burden. The so-called new style is neither more convenient for the pullers nor provides any special comfort for the riders. It is merely expensive and difficult to place, harming the rickshaw merchants. To comply with the wishes of the Public Works Department's Vehicle Committee, the rickshaw merchants specially submitted a sample for inspection, requesting that, while maintaining the existing vehicle style, we be allowed to make improvements within our means. However, despite submitting this request many days ago, we have yet to receive any approval. Within the Vehicle Committee, only one person is diligently designing behind closed doors. This will only waste large sums of money without any practical benefit. In short, anything that requires mandatory enforcement must have minimal benefit and significant drawbacks. Otherwise, the Vehicle Committee's new style would naturally gain popularity without needing to be promoted or forced. The inconvenience of pulling the Vehicle Committee's new style is an undeniable fact. We rickshaw merchants are the ones who perform this labor, and our understanding of the advantages and disadvantages is not something that those who merely argue can comprehend. Therefore, the new style that rickshaw merchants are being forced to use must be abolished. We rickshaw merchants should strive to make improvements to the existing vehicles so that both pullers and riders are satisfied. (2) Rickshaw Mutual Aid Association: The rickshaw pullers' status is precarious due to their small business, weak individual strength, and lack of leadership. There has never been a comprehensive relief system. Recognizing this, the Public Works Department formulated a draft plan for managing and assisting rickshaw pullers last year, appointing responsible personnel to organize the association. All mutual aid funds are collected from the rickshaw pullers, with seven cents per day. This collection process is handled daily by the rickshaw merchants, who also have to prepay the fees when renewing licenses. This matter concerns the rickshaw pullers themselves, and we rickshaw merchants have no say in it. However, we rickshaw merchants not only bear the burden of collecting the fees but also the obligation to prepay them. Therefore, we feel compelled to speak out. The Mutual Aid Association aims to provide relief to rickshaw pullers, and the significance of this relief is substantial. Since the collection of mutual aid fees began, it has amounted to a substantial 180,000 yuan. However, the results of the relief efforts have been negligible, with the rickshaw pullers receiving virtually nothing. During the summer, the Public Works Department provides water buckets for horses pulling carts to relieve their thirst and prevent heatstroke, without collecting mutual aid fees from the horses. However, the rickshaw pullers are only subject to the sacrifice of paying mutual aid fees without receiving the right to relief. Now, in the heat of summer, they are proposing to set up only twenty-two teapots, which is insufficient. This is a great disparity in treatment between humans and animals. We also understand that the person in charge of the association's affairs is Dr. Zhu Maocheng, a former labor director who attended international labor conferences. We rickshaw merchants are greatly pleased to hear this and congratulate the rickshaw pullers, believing that Dr. Zhu will use his knowledge and experience to relieve the laborers and provide them with genuine assistance, making him a savior to the labor community. However, the actual results have been the opposite. There is still time to improve the situation. Given the urgent need during this hot weather, the rickshaw pullers should be provided with water bottles like those used by Boy Scouts or the military, numbered to match the vehicle licenses, and distributed to each vehicle to provide water for thirst. At the same time, each rickshaw puller should be given two bottles of "Seven Good" medicine and items like straw hats and running shoes to prevent heatstroke when walking under the scorching sun. If the substantial funds collected from the rickshaw pullers are not used to provide them with relief, how can Dr. Zhu answer to the rickshaw pullers who pay the mutual aid fees, to the Chinese directors who recommended him, and to the taxpayers who support his salary? The above two points are the common grievances and suffering felt by both rickshaw merchants and rickshaw pullers. We respectfully submit this and request your association to provide fair and impartial guidance and assistance. We humbly submit this and hope for your consideration, for the sake of virtue and convenience. We respectfully submit this to the Shanghai Public Concession Chinese Ratepayers' Association. The Taxpayers' Association has forwarded it to the Public Works Department."</p>
<h3 id="e116">French Concession Municipal Council Urges Rickshaw Pullers to Register Promptly; Starting Next Month, Those Who Violate the Regulations and Are Not Registered Will Be Prohibited from Operating <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>The French Concession Municipal Council has been conducting rickshaw puller registration for two months, and the registration process has been enthusiastic. However, there are still a few rickshaw pullers who, influenced by others, are taking a wait-and-see approach. To expedite the completion of the registration, the council has decided on strict measures and announced that all rickshaw pullers must register promptly. The announcement states: "The French Concession authorities have recently discovered that certain organizations are obstructing the registration of rickshaw pullers. The authorities have decided on the following measures: (1) Starting August 1st, rickshaw pullers who do not comply with the registration regulations and hold licenses above number 16,000 will not be allowed to operate in the French Concession. (2) Starting August 1st, rickshaws whose pullers do not comply with the registration regulations and hold licenses above number 16,000 will be immediately detained. (3) Detained rickshaws will only be returned to the owners after the rickshaw pullers comply with the registration regulations. Regarding the registration dates for rickshaw pullers, in accordance with the French Concession authorities' regulations for rickshaw puller registration, this police station will begin processing the registration of rickshaw pullers with the following license numbers starting on August 1st of this year: August 1st to 10th: register numbers 15,501 to 16,000; August 12th to 20th: register numbers 15,001 to 15,500; August 21st to 31st: register numbers 14,501 to 15,000. Rickshaw pullers must bring their registration application forms (vehicles do not need to be brought) to No. 28 Xuehuali Road."</p>

<p>In recent years, various industries have been in decline, and the shipping industry has inevitably been affected. There are few purchases of new ships, and shipping companies, in order to save expenses, are adopting a policy of minimizing ship repairs. There are two British-owned shipbuilding and ship repair companies in Shanghai: one is Ruirong, and the other is the Yiesonglao Dockyard. Recently, both have seen a significant decrease in work and are struggling to profit. Therefore, during the recent annual shareholders' meeting of the Yiesonglao Dockyard, a proposal was made for the two companies to merge their operations to avoid competing with each other and suffering losses together. The proposal will be reviewed by the board of directors and assisted by three or four major shareholders. After the review is completed and a written opinion is prepared, a shareholders' meeting will be convened for a decision.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Hangzhou Buddhist Association Sues Cihang Weekly for Defamation; Details of Defamatory Facts and Violations Presented; Defendant Did Not Appear at Yesterday's Court Hearing <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Master Quefei, 63 years old, from Fujian, the abbot of Lingyin Temple and a standing committee member of the Hangzhou Buddhist Association, Master Mutao, 40 years old, from Wuxing, the abbot of Fajing Temple, and Master Benlian, 39 years old, from Haining, recently filed a lawsuit because the Cihang Weekly (located at No. 254, Xiafei Road (intersection of Songshan Road)), published on June 17th of this year, an article about the re-election of the abbot of Liansi Temple in Hangzhou, which contained malicious defamation, accusing the Hangzhou Buddhist Association of not being a legitimate organization of monks. Although the abbots are</p>
<p>detached from worldly concerns, they must strictly adhere to the monastic rules. The defamed party is a group, and Hangzhou is a place where ancient Buddhist temples and cultural treasures converge. The association is the only religious organization legally registered. Therefore, the credibility is greatly affected. In their capacity as legal representatives of the association, they engaged lawyer Gu Kenfu to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, suing the Cihang Weekly for disseminating words to damage the reputation of the organization. The complaint stated that the weekly disseminated words defaming</p>
<p>a religious organization, failed to legally record the names of the publisher and editor, and filed a private lawsuit, along with civil charges. The complaint stated that the association is composed of monasteries in Hangzhou and has been registered with party and government agencies as a legitimate religious organization and has been repeatedly rewarded by the government for its social service. On June 17th of this year, the defendant published an article about the re-election of the abbot of Liansi Temple in Hangzhou, stating that the city's Buddhist association was not organized by legitimate monks and had repeatedly violated the law. These accusations were groundless and malicious. Although the monks are detached from worldly concerns, they must</p>
<p>adhere to the monastic rules. The defamed party is not a single individual but a group. Hangzhou is a major center of Buddhism, with many ancient monasteries. The association is the only representative organization of Buddhism in Hangzhou. Its credibility is greatly affected. This matter concerns the public, and silence cannot be maintained. The reasons for filing the private lawsuit are stated separately as follows: Regarding the defamation,</p>
<p>freedom of speech is essential. However, there must be true facts, and the facts must be related to public interest and subject to fair comment. This is the inevitable interpretation of the law. Reading the defendant's article, it is unfounded and maliciously accuses the association of being an illegal organization of monks and falsely states that the association has been involved in illegal activities. It is not known who the so-called illegal monks are or what illegal activities they have been involved in.</p>
<p>The defendant's actions violated Article 246, Paragraph 1, and Article 310, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code and Article 261, Paragraph 1, and Article 325, Paragraph 2 of the old Criminal Code. Regarding the failure to record the names of the editor and publisher, the names of the publisher and editor of newspapers and magazines must be recorded, as stipulated in Article 12 of the Publication Law. According to Article 30 of the same law, publications without the records specified in Article 12 or with inaccurate records are subject to a fine of up to 200 yuan. Since its publication, the defendant has repeatedly made insinuations against monks. This time, it has defamed a public organization.</p>
<p>A thorough search of the newspaper revealed that there were no records of the names of the editor and publisher. The intention to evade responsibility after committing a crime is self-evident. The defendant's illegal actions violated Article 12 of the Publication Law and should be punished in accordance with Article 30 of the same law. Regarding the supplementary civil charges, the defendant's criminal actions directly damaged the association's credibility. The defendant should be responsible for restoring the association's reputation and compensating for the damage. To restore the reputation, the court must order that</p>
<p>the full text of the court's judgment be published in major newspapers in Shanghai and Hangzhou for three days, with the defendant bearing the cost. Regarding damages, the value of the association's reputation cannot be estimated with money. Therefore, we only request the court to order compensation of one yuan as a legal expression. Based on the above reasons, we request the court to promptly summon the responsible editor and publisher of the newspaper to court and punish them for their crimes, and in the supplementary</p>
<p>civil lawsuit, order the defendant to fulfill the plaintiff's request to maintain the law and protect the reputation of public organizations. Based on the complaint, the court opened the Second Criminal Court at 11:00 AM yesterday, presided over by Judge Qiu Huanying. The lawyer representing the plaintiffs stated the purpose of the complaint as above. No one from the defendant, Cihang Weekly, appeared in court. The court then ordered the plaintiff to investigate and report the names of the defendant's publisher, editor, and other personnel to the court for a rescheduled hearing and then adjourned.</p>

<p>Hunan Association in Shanghai: The office of the Hunan Drought Relief Association's representative in Shanghai received a telegram from Chairman He Hao of the Hunan Provincial Flood Relief Headquarters and a detailed letter from Cao Bowen, Director of the Hunan Civil Affairs Department, reporting on the forty counties affected by the disaster and the collapse of over a thousand embankments. The letter detailed the situation in the most severely affected counties of Hunan as follows: (1) Yiyang: On the 8th of this month, the Zi River experienced a flash flood, with the water level rising to several Zhang (丈 - approximately 3.3 meters). Areas such as He Xing, Hucheng, Gaojia, Yanhe, Wenjia, Datian, Paitou, Xujia, Tongyou, Jinhua, Xiaozhou, Shahe, Yongxing, Yonghe, and Changchun were flooded. Baolian, Nanmen, and Dugong were submerged, and fields, crops, and houses were completely destroyed. (2) Changde: Floodwaters from Chenzhou's Baihe River reached several Zhang, flowing downstream and reaching depths of over a Zhang in Changde's Nanmen area. The Baguan Embankment outside Dongguan collapsed. (3) Yueyang: From June 20th to July 3rd, the lake water rose by more than two Zhang. Small embankments throughout Hunan were submerged, resulting in the submersion of over 113,000 Mu (畝 - approx. 667 sq meters). (4) Anxiang: The Yuan and Feng Rivers flooded, submerging over 300,000 Mu of fields in Anxiang County, and drowning over 1,000 people. (5) Yuanjiang: 197 embankments of various sizes were breached, affecting over 200,000 people, with over 1,000 killed by the floods. (6) Cili: Starting in June, continuous heavy rain fell for five days and nights. The Lou and Feng Rivers rose more than six Zhang, turning the county seat and districts one, two, three, four, and five into a watery expanse, drowning over 10,000 people. (7) Lixian: At You Shi (5-7 PM) on June 5th, the city wall was breached by the floodwaters. The orphanage, poor people's factory, relief center, prison, girls' school, low-lying houses, shops, and people were all lost, buried in the bellies of fish. The estimated death toll exceeded 2,000 people. (8) Shimen: Since June 20th, continuous rain fell. On July 3rd and 4th, torrential rain fell in Cili for two full nights. From Nishan, Suoshi, Zaoshi, Yanshi, Zaoshi, Baishadu, Xinguang, Yijiadu, and Tongziping, hundreds of Li (里 - approx. 500 meters) were turned into a vast expanse of water. All buildings in the county, except for the county government which was spared from collapse, including other agencies, schools, shops, and civilian homes were reduced to rubble. The death toll exceeded 10,000 people. (9) In Hanshou County, over 300 embankments of various sizes were breached, and the loss of fields, homes, livestock, and human lives was incalculable.</p>
<p>Hubei Association: Yesterday, we received a telegram from Sun Zhounian, representative of the former inspection and relief deputy director, saying: "Guan Jiongzhi, Liu Wanqing, Gao Jianqing, and all village elders, please be advised. Our Hubei province is unfortunately facing overlapping calamities. The Red Scourge has not been quelled, and natural disasters continue to strike. The early drought caused immense suffering to the people. Before we could catch our breath, continuous heavy rains this summer led to flash floods, creating an unstoppable force. Xiang and Yun were the first to bear the brunt, followed by the Han River region. Embankments collapsed, unleashing devastation for thousands of Li. Jing and Sha became vast pools, and Hanyang was submerged. The Yangtze River surged, causing widespread flooding. The entire city of Hankou was nearly turned into a swamp. Fortunately, the military and civilians joined forces and worked through the night to avert a major catastrophe. Now that the river level has receded slightly, strong winds and waves persist. As we enter the flood season, water levels continue to fluctuate. Hankou, located at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers, is a low-lying area facing constant danger. Despite the protection of the Zhang Embankment, years of disrepair have weakened its structure, making breaches imminent. The area affected by the floods has reached forty-nine counties, with hundreds of thousands of people dead and countless properties lost. Fields were washed away, houses were destroyed, and entire families of more than ten people tied themselves together and perished in the flood. Floating corpses drift everywhere, leaving the dead without burial. The situation is unspeakably tragic, with countless livestock lost. It is reported that Yangluo Town, located at the confluence of the Yangtze and Han rivers, is retrieving over a thousand corpses daily. The stench of decaying bodies is unbearable. This is a catastrophe unseen in a century. Natural disasters have struck, and the calamities have not ended. The dead are gone, but the living are in dire need. Millions of refugees are in urgent need of assistance. Some are clinging to rooftops and tile ridges, while others are taking refuge in corners of cities and treetops, exposed to the sun, dew, heat, and water. Cries of hunger and weeping fill the air, as lives hang by a thread. The suffering is so severe that even Zheng Xia's 'Refugee Picture' cannot fully capture its horror. Without swift aid, millions of survivors will die not only from the floods but also from starvation and disease. The situation is more severe than the great flood of 1931. People are on the verge of death, like lamps flickering in the wind, desperately seeking food like a great drought yearning for rain. We implore you, gentlemen, to show compassion and concern for your homeland, and to treat this unprecedented disaster as a call for action. Let us pool our resources, no matter how small, and gather strength to create a significant impact. Your efforts will not be in vain, and the people will benefit greatly. We rely on your generosity and compassion to bring relief and restore harmony. Your kindness will be remembered forever. The Yangtze River flows ahead, and we await your benevolent response. With tears in our eyes, we present this urgent appeal, hoping for your compassionate assistance. Sun Songnian and San Jiguang, on behalf of millions of flood victims, bow and plead."</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Famine Relief Committee: We have previously reported on the disasters along the Yellow River and the Yangtze River. We now present the recent relief reports as follows: (Hubei) The Chamber of Commerce of Laohekou City sent a telegram stating: "Since the 3rd of this month, heavy rain has fallen continuously for several days and nights. On the 5th, a flash flood occurred, submerging nearly all of the town's seventy streets and lanes. The water depth ranged from several Zhang to several Chi (尺 - approx. 0.33 meters). Countless people and livestock were swept away, and many houses collapsed. The rain stopped on the 8th, and the water receded slightly. The cries of mourning are unbearable. Countless people are without food or shelter. Transportation to surrounding areas has not yet been restored. We hear that hundreds of Li upstream and downstream have been affected, but the extent of the disaster is unknown. Our Chamber of Commerce has joined with various agencies and organizations to form a relief committee and is providing aid to accessible areas. However, the town's food supply is only sufficient for a few days. Raising funds is difficult, and finding food to purchase is impossible. The future is bleak. We are doing our best to make arrangements and will provide a detailed report with photos later. We urgently appeal for relief." (Henan) The educators of Yanshi County sent a telegram stating: "Since the Yi and Luo River flood of 1931, our county has suffered from severe drought, causing the people to become destitute and displaced. They have not yet recovered. Suddenly, on the 6th of this month, heavy rain fell. That night, the Yi and Luo Rivers flooded, roaring and surging. In an instant, the embankments were in danger. On the afternoon of the 8th, the embankments breached, flooding the city. The water level was as high as the city walls. By nightfall, the floodwaters were even more violent. The city and surrounding areas were submerged in a vast expanse of water. Mothers disregarded their own safety to save their children, and filial sons struggled to rescue their fathers. The cries of terror were heartbreaking. Corpses littered the streets, and a foul stench filled the city. Most of the houses were swept away. Those who managed to escape were left to sleep in the wilderness, without warm clothing or food. The scene was truly heart-wrenching. Along the riverbanks, for dozens of Li, the water merged with the sky. Over a thousand villages were turned into swamps. About five hundred people died, and almost no houses remained intact. Tens of thousands of acres of fertile land were covered in sand. The tragedy is beyond words. We urgently appeal for immediate assistance." (Anhui) Yang Jiaoguang and others, representatives of Zhang Gaobao in the third district of Dongliu, sent a telegram stating: "Zhang Gaobao, Dongliu County, is located near the river and is a low-lying area. The great flood of 1931 and the severe drought of last year have severely damaged the region. Recovery has not yet occurred. However, heaven continues to inflict disaster. Since June 21st, continuous heavy rains have caused flash floods and tidal waves to reverse flow, creating a confluence from both sides. The entire area has turned into a swamp. Houses and graves are submerged in water. Low-lying areas are submerged by 11 or 12 Chi, and short houses have completely disappeared. High-lying areas are submerged by 7 or 8 Chi. Those who have survived the disaster are once again suffering from this severe and unprecedented catastrophe. Like water becoming deeper and fire becoming hotter, we, the representatives, are heartbroken by the sight of the disaster. We urgently appeal for relief to save the victims."

<h3 id="e123">Opening of National Products Exhibitions in Various Districts <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Gaochang District:</p>
<p>Due to the delayed setup by various manufacturers, the official opening ceremony was rescheduled for 2:00 PM yesterday. Over seventy manufacturers participated, and each booth was adorned with red and green, creating a visually appealing scene. To attract public attention, the association held a three-day promotional parade starting yesterday.</p>
<p>Hudong:</p>
<p>The Hudong District National Products Exhibition, organized by the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, held its opening ceremony at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Over 200 people attended, including Lin Kanghou, Chen Jicheng, Sun Xinzhu, Xu Xiaochu, Liu Zhongying of the Manufacturers Association, Ge Futian of the Nantong Association, Qi Zhigong, Chen Jiufeng, and Tao Leqin of the Citizens Association. Lin Kanghou, Sun Xinzhu, and Liu Zhongying served as the presidium. After the meeting commenced, Chairman Liu Zhongying reported: "Our association recognizes that in recent years, the decline of the agricultural sector and the economic recession have led to a weakening of industry and commerce in our country. Foreign goods have taken advantage of this opportunity to flood our markets, pushing the domestic industry to the brink of collapse. Therefore, we have joined with various national products manufacturers to hold this exhibition. The Hudong area has lacked this kind of promotion in the past, making this event a pioneering endeavor. We are honored by the presence of guests from all walks of life despite the summer heat. We hope for your continued support so that the future of industry and commerce may see a glimmer of hope." Cao Zhigong spoke next: "In recent years, our country has suffered from the economic aggression of foreign powers. Every year, the import of foreign goods reaches over 600 million Yuan. On average, each citizen spends one Yuan and five Jiao (角 - one-tenth of a Yuan) on foreign goods. This massive outflow of money weakens the nation's vitality. We must recognize that the people of other countries deeply love their own. However, the intellectual class in our country idolizes foreign goods, and domestic manufacturers stick to outdated methods, making it difficult to compete with foreign goods. Now that domestic products are still in their early stages, our people should promote and nurture them so they can thrive. I hope that all our Hudong compatriots will support this national products exhibition. This is what I hope for from you all." Due to the delayed setup, the Gaochang exhibition will open for business today.</p>

<p>The rebellious spirit is full of his poems, letters, travel notes, and essays. The Qing Dynasty was listed as a banned book and destroyed for more than 300 years. Recently, thanks to the advocacy of Zhou Zuoren, Lin Yutang, and other gentlemen, the introduction of the text can be found in various publications. There have been reprints in the market, but the better ones are too expensive, ranging from more than ten yuan, and the inferior ones are full of mistakes, and the price is also one yuan or so. The owner of the China Library has published the good books he collected, reprinted with live typefaces, carefully proofread and beautifully bound, divided into three styles, each to meet the needs of readers. A book of cloth-faced gold-letter fine binding sells for only one yuan and five corners. A book in a combined book sells for only eight corners. There are five books on the collection of poetry, the collection of essays, the ruler, the travel notes, and the pen, which are sold together for eight corners and five minutes. The price is only enough for the cost of the initial publication, so the book has just been printed and has been pre-ordered by the same industry in various ports for the most part. Some are entrusted to Shanghai Magazine Company, No. 324 Sima Road, for general distribution.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn Summer Coolness</p>
<h3 id="e140">Tidbits <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>— (Yinhu)</p>
<p>People who are always around ninety (degrees) have all gone to escape the summer heat. Those without money, though wiping away buckets of sweat, must still work, and when they find a space, they also need to cool off. Though the situations are different, everyone can enjoy the pleasure.</p>
<p>Those with money go to the high mountains, where the valley breeze comes, cooling the heart and spleen; it is indeed especially comfortable. People who are... between the flowing waters of the countryside, with willow banks and gentle breezes, a bright moon and quiet people, is also enough for one to enjoy the summer.</p>
<p>Racing in cars on the brightly lit avenues might not be as good as drifting in a small boat, leisurely in the middle of the river, with the river breeze and mountain moon, allowing one to dissipate one's worries.</p>
<p>In magnificent buildings, turning on electric fans and eating ice cream, and sitting under a melon trellis, waving a palm-leaf fan, and eating chilled watermelon are each wonderfully enjoyable.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Watermelon <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— Xiaochu</p>
<p>Watermelon with seeds like snowflakes and silk is the best quality. The ones with thin skin and deep green color are the genuine article. They taste sweet, have plenty of water, and are cool and refreshing in the mouth, enough to dispel summer heat and cleanse the chest. Nothing compares to it. When you raise a knife to cut it open, the sound is crisp, and juice flows everywhere, the fragrance filling the nose. The seeds are arranged in neat rows of black and white, and when chewed, there is no residue to spit out. This is the best of watermelons.</p>
<p>According to experienced watermelon growers, the most important thing is to choose the seeds. If the seeds are bad, even if the planting is done well, there will be no good fruit. Moreover, the influence can spread to other watermelons. Even if you have good seeds, they will gradually become inferior. Because watermelons are formed by cross-pollination, you must be careful when planting. Secondly, it is important to press down the vines. About twenty pools per acre is the rate. Each plant should have its vines pressed down in more than ten places. This way, the roots will be buried deep in the soil and get a thick foundation. One plant can produce seven or eight watermelons. Too many and the watermelons won't be big. There is also a difference in timing. The first ones to form are the "head vine" watermelons, followed by the "...vine" watermelons, and the last are the "final vine" watermelons. The quality is then lower. Thirdly, fertilization is essential. In botanical terms, watermelons belong to the gourd family, which likes to be nourished. Some planters save money by using pig manure, which makes the watermelons taste sour. If human waste is used, this problem doesn't occur. The most particular growers use dog feces or pigeon manure, which makes the northern melon (referring to a high quality watermelon) incomparable. Fourthly, it depends on the weather. If there is a severe drought like last year, watering morning and evening takes a lot of effort, but the watermelons will be numerous, and the harvest will be good. If the rain doesn't come when it should, not only will the fruits easily fall off after flowering, but also it will be hard to get a sweet watermelon. Therefore, the success of the watermelon harvest varies from year to year. This is the general picture.</p>
<p>In terms of location, Shanghai watermelons are most famous from Sanlintang. In the past, Zhaishan, Qiaohaiyuan Market, and Hexing were also quite famous. However, Sanlintang has green-skinned and black-skinned varieties. The green-skinned ones are often snowy, and the black-skinned ones are often red and yellow. There is a type of watermelon that is smaller in shape, with a slightly lighter skin color and fine stripes. It is called a foreign watermelon. It is sweet, with red seeds and extremely thin skin. It is also a good variety. As for making watermelon lanterns, the pulp is removed, and floral patterns are carved on the outside, with a candle lit inside, hanging in the corridor, which is very attractive. It is also an indispensable pleasure for cooling off in the summer nights, so I mention it to give watermelon enthusiasts a try.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Cold Drinks <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>In hot weather, everyone loves to have some cold drinks.</p>
<p>Speaking of cold drinks, there is naturally no city with more than ours. Just ice cream alone has prices ranging from high-end to suit the palates of the first-class people, while at the same time, there are also ones that are affordable for people in the lowest social classes. Naturally, between the most expensive and the cheapest, there are still three levels and nine grades. No matter what class of people you are, there is ice cream that suits your status to eat. Although the high-end ice cream is said to have only one or two thousand bacteria in each cup, and the low-end ice cream is said to have thirty or fifty thousand bacteria in each cup, it's not uncommon, but the ice cream business, whether high-end or low-end, is equally prosperous.</p>
<p>The same goes for shaved ice. In cafes, waitresses carry it on porcelain plates, selling shaved ice. On the streets, cups that cost twenty copper coins also sell shaved ice. Even more grassroots, those carrying a tattered straw bag, shouting in the alleys, "Cold drink! Selling ice!" Although what they sell, who knows if it's machine-made ice or natural ice, but the work they do of "relieving thirst and cooling off" is the same.</p>
<p>Soda is naturally also a blessing in the summer, but following soda, there's fresh orange juice. Following fresh orange juice, there's mineral water. This has the effect of relieving inflammation and cooling off, that has the effect of relieving heat and driving away煩惱，and even more people are praising what kind of water can invigorate the spleen and stomach, and what kind of water can cure diseases and prolong life. We really don't know how many wooden fish we broke in our previous lives, but in this life, we get to enjoy these good flavors.</p>
<p>In addition, there are also "Cool Mint Mung Bean Soup," "Authentic Beijing Plum Juice." And, um, I can't remember all of them for a moment. In short, there are so many, all of which are cold drinks that are both cooling, hygienic, and delicious. You can pick and choose whatever you want to drink and eat.</p>
<p>However, peddlers and coolies always put their mouths to the tap and drink greedily as if drinking sweet dew and jade nectar. If it weren't for these peddlers and coolies having a strange fondness for tap water, then I think that even though there are so many cold drinks in this city, there would at least still be some people feeling left out!</p>

<p>— Huoxueming</p>
<p>Sleeping on a cool, smooth bamboo mat, yet pearls of sweat still steam out, how can one not, upon waking in the morning, first cast a glance at the sky? Behold the azure blue, clear clouds, both fixed and far away; even if there is a clump of gray cloud, it will soon dissipate like smoke. Thinking that a sudden downpour will not immediately be unleashed, the greasy sweat seeps out from within the skin. Appreciating closely, even if one's own flesh is not tender: in fact, this magical transformation, leaping out miraculously point by point, can indeed add some miscellaneous interest. If a clump of gray cloud on the horizon becomes denser and darker, and the area also becomes larger, for fear of the heat; my heart flies into the sweet-smelling lake breeze. I only hope that the willows outside dance wildly, the sun is blown out, the gray clouds fly to the treetops, transforming into clear tears, flowing from the willow eyes, green rain, green wind, green world; is there enough peace? Enough that hasn't been cleared? I can no longer spare any emotion to further think of the Yellow River in flood, the Yangtze River overflowing, and what will happen after the cotton seedlings rot. Because everyone in the world is pathetically selfish. Yet can you—?</p>
<p>You must reflect carefully! In the current scorching heat of the world, like a melting furnace, everyone is a piece of iron, burning red. Almost no one's body is not scorching in the harsh heat flow, you scorch me, I scorch you; dancing on thorns, singing under the iron hammer, being baked until unbearable, being beaten until unbearable; yet one should endure, one should smile, one should carve out one's own soul. Even if you can no longer bear this heat, this beating, you cannot escape this melting furnace.</p>
<p>Furthermore, there is indeed a corner of the world, buried in the vast cold water: fishing boats are rowing on the streets, the city walls are submerged at the bottom of the boats; the mountain peaks are full of people, holding their bellies, waiting for the gods; children are pulling on their mothers' sleeves, crying, stretching out withered fingers, yet mothers have no way, and cruelly push their children down the mountain, like rotten, hot apples, "thump" a hit, drifting into the waves; then they themselves fall down and die. Even the birds and beasts that perch on the islands, disturbed by the people, also fly to hot places to live. - Thinking, thinking of this sad picture of "the end of the water," even if you are full of fire, isn't your heart already frozen! May everyone close their eyes, like silently reciting "Namo Amitabha"; silently reciting what history will come after the great floods of the twentieth year of the Republic!</p>
<h3 id="e146">Safe Sea Bathing <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Peiyu</p>
<p>The weather is too hot, and sea bathing is in season again. The sea bathing beaches have already opened, waiting for us to dissipate the sweltering heat. However, there are several ways to prevent danger that people who like sea bathing must pay attention to; especially people who are not very healthy and are older, and those who have done very strenuous work and have not yet recovered from their fatigue should be cautious. Such people should not rush to take a sea bath before they have had sufficient time to rest, or before they have acclimatized themselves to the new environment. You should also not go into the sea less than three hours after a meal; because going bathing with a stomach full of food is like inviting disaster to come.</p>
<p>The ears must be protected. It is best to wear a well-fitting soft cap or plug them with cotton; otherwise, the force of the waves will damage the eardrums inside the ears. It is better to bathe at high tide than at low tide, because low tide is close to the beach, and the beach can transmit the heat obtained from the sun's rays to the sea water. If you feel cold on your body, it is a clear sign that you have stayed in the sea water for too long. In this case, the time spent in the water should be reduced; if you feel cold, then sea bathing should be avoided. In short, sea bathing should not cause any discomfort. If you cannot feel absolutely comfortable, it is a smart idea not to take a sea bath; otherwise, you may not be able to withstand the stimulus you encounter.</p>
<p>Before or after a sea bath, it is even more beneficial to wear a swimsuit that exposes the chest and back, and take a sunbath or outdoor exercise. If the sunlight is strong, just wear a cool hat on your head and a pair of sunglasses on your nose. The first day you lie in the sun's rays should be shorter, about five to ten minutes. Showering after bathing can not only remove all the dirt from the body, but also promote and improve blood circulation.</p>
<p>Sea water contains many valuable salts, which increase and accelerate blood circulation when stimulated by cold water, making it easier for our bodies to excrete dirt from the skin. Moreover, the waves hitting our bodies can have the same effect as a strong massage. Therefore, a healthy sea bather should be struck by the waves as much as possible, especially on the back and limbs.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Summer Night <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Xingsheng</p>
<p>In this hot summer, everyone feels a sense of depression. But when night comes, the scorching sun hides its tracks, and a cool breeze slowly arrives, bringing a refreshing change of air. After we have been working hard and sweating all day, our bodies are exhausted, and our spirits feel dry and dull, we need this refreshing air to regulate us. Therefore, in the summer, everyone welcomes the arrival of night.</p>
<p>Summer nights are ultimately lovely. On the edges of every road or in an alley, you can always see groups of people enjoying the cool. Old and young, men and women, bustling and chatting happily. Some are singing loudly, some are playing the erhu, singing滩簧, some are singing lewd songs such as "Sister, I love you" and "Little boy comes into the room." Perhaps, this is the only way they think to cool off in this lovely summer night! However, a thoughtful person who hears it will feel the "a courtesan does not know the hatred of a fallen nation, still singing courtyard flowers across the river!"</p>
<p>There are also some young men and women who are usually not very easy to approach. In the summer night, they can take advantage of the opportunity to enjoy the cool to talk about love with the people they are interested in; plus, the thin clothes cling tightly to the body, revealing an alluring sensuality everywhere. People are the most sensual and spiritual animals, so how can they not be captivated? Therefore, in this summer night, you can find men and women chasing, hugging, kissing, joking, and other such romantic cases anytime, anywhere.</p>
<p>Ah! Summer night, ultimately lovely; at the same time, it is also a mysterious night!</p>
<h3 id="e148">Wonderful Summer Products <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Ting Gong</p>
<p>Shen Li floating melon, although it was a summer pastime of the ancients, but today, with the development of science, commentators say that using melons and fruits to relieve the summer heat has lost the spirit of the times. Hygienists are particularly extremely忌瓜果食口，saying that they are easy to get germs, easy to breed worms，then how will they spend a long, hot summer?</p>
<p>Beer is cool and mellow, made from spring water, and contains nutrients. However, the market lacks excellent domestic products. Although fashionable men and women need it a lot, (Westerners drink beer in all seasons.) But whether the goods cater to the psychology of the general public and whether the price is in line with the purchasing power of the society are both things that are worth paying attention to.</p>
<p>Now the China Tao Le Beer Company will rise in Shanghai. The host, Mr. Li Zhaofan, is a typical young businessman who has accumulated many years of research and is launching it at once. The company's Tao Le beer, in terms of materials and prices, can cater to the general needs, and it also holds a spirit of sacrifice, aiming to expand the market, not to make profits. It has set up a distribution office at 115 Hankou Road. Recently, the door is like a market, which is really good news in the sound of summer.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Icebox Notes <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Chuyu</p>
<p>In middle-class families in big cities, almost everyone has an icebox to prevent food spoilage and for the convenience of cold drinks and food. However, there are several points to pay attention to when using an icebox: (1) Do not let the cold air inside the box leak out too much, that is, do not open and close the box door frequently, so that the hot air from the outside flows in, and the temperature drops sharply. The entry and exit of stored items must be very rapid. (2) When storing warm things in the box, cover the top of the container with white cloth or thin paper, so as not to let the dew caused by the hot air fall on the food and damage the flavor of the food. When storing fresh chicken, fish, and meat, put ice on top to keep the fresh flavor. (3) The amount of ice used varies depending on the type and quantity of food, and the number of times the box door is opened and closed. For the first two or three days, put more ice, and then put a certain amount every morning. Then, you can keep the internal temperature evenly and will not change greatly. (4) The inside of the box should be kept dry and clean, and not be damp. Wash it with boiling water three or four times a month. If there is a foul smell or fatty smell, wash it with soap and boiling water. (5) If there is water melted from ice in the box, wipe it off immediately, because ice water reduces the coldness and is extremely unsanitary. The drainage hole should be washed clean frequently to prevent dirt from accumulating. Sawdust and the like that are夹在冰上, wash it clean before putting it in the box. The drainage hole is often blocked by dirt, emitting a foul smell, and pests hide there, so be careful. (6) If the亜鉛皮inside the box is沾了油膩，it will rust. Wash it with alkaline water first, then wipe it with 酒精. (7) An ordinary box can maintain 40 degrees Fahrenheit, which is most suitable for storing food. (8) The icebox should be placed away from direct sunlight and near stoves to avoid热传道 and loss of ice consumption. (9) Do not put hot things in the box, because when put in the box, the temperature is different from the temperature in the box, and dew will fall on the food. (10) Milk, fish, and meat should be placed on the bottom layer, and beer and fruit can be placed on the top layer, because the temperature of the bottom layer is the lowest, and the cold air of the ice descends from above due to the specific gravity. As for the effect of ice, it is originally to inhibit the growth of bacteria. At 40 degrees Fahrenheit, it cannot kill bacteria. The amount of water and the structure of the box are very important. For example, if you use 20 pounds of ice, you can keep the icebox at 52 degrees Fahrenheit. If the ice melts to 15 pounds, the temperature will rise to 60 degrees. If it melts to 10 pounds, the temperature will rise to 70 degrees, so the ice in the box should be replenished frequently, so that the original temperature can be maintained. The relationship between bacterial growth and temperature is as follows: in one day and night, at 40 degrees Fahrenheit, bacteria can multiply 9 grains, 45 degrees 13 grains, 50 degrees 39 grains, 55 degrees 90 grains, 60 degrees 110 grains. From this, we can know that as the temperature rises, the bacteria multiply faster.</p>

The college's curriculum still lacks a general physics course, which should be established immediately. A physics laboratory, soil laboratory, and greenhouse are necessary facilities for agricultural science and should be added in order. The Physics Laboratory at the Hebei Medical College is also lacking, so the two colleges can temporarily negotiate to jointly organize and use it. 2. The college's research work has been paying attention to the needs of the province. In the future, they should establish contact with the agricultural experimental fields of the Provincial Department of Construction to seek promotion. This is hereby ordered for compliance and reporting."</p>

Upon reviewing the report of the inspectors this time, the college is still planning to improve the points raised by this department. The following key points are now listed for reporting and handling: 1. The college should add a public health department within the possible range of funding to meet local needs, and appropriately increase the equipment of the midwifery class and expand it into a nursing midwifery department. 2. If the college's internship facilities cannot be fully equipped at once, it may temporarily negotiate cooperation methods with the local Si Luo Hospital and the Health Education Department of the Dingxian Chinese Semi-Civil Education Promotion Association to provide internships. 3. The college's training management officials should strictly implement the established implementation methods and encourage teachers to provide guidance in order to cultivate the ability to serve society in the future. This order is hereby given," etc.</p>

In the early morning, overseas silver markets and forward silver prices were stable. Exchange rates were slightly higher. London gold rose one penny. Sentiment was normal.

<p>The yarn market, which has been rising wildly for days, saw a reaction and a drop yesterday. However, rumors in the market have not stopped, claiming that someone is buying in large quantities in preparation for a squeeze in the near-term market. However, the spot price of yarn has not been raised for the time being. The price of August-dated bid yarn has exceeded a portion of the spot price. Buyers' sentiment is extremely strong, and speculators are buying indiscriminately. However, several yarn mills are selling a significant amount of forward-dated contracts for prudence, it is said.</p>
<p>The price of forward yarn also fell by $1.70. Before the opening of the bid yarn market, there was much discussion and debate, with many bullish views on the yarn market. It was said that a certain party was buying in an organized manner in the near-term market, so the August market was still tight. After the mills sold contracts in the forward market, the market loosened and fell by $0.70-0.80. When bidding began, although this month's price fell, the longs raised the price again in the forward market, with the mid-month price being higher and then rebounding. When the market closed, it was heard that sales in the spot yarn market were not smooth, and selling sentiment suddenly intensified. The market suddenly dropped. As a result, the near-term price fell by $0.40-$0.80 compared to the previous day's closing price, and the forward price fell by $1.60-$1.70. The following companies sold: Dafeng 600 bales, Yida 750 bales, Zhenda 550 bales, Hexing 450 bales, Senkang 700 bales, Shenyu 650 bales, Renfeng 900 bales, Yichang 2,000 bales, Xinhua 750 bales, and Tonghe 450 bales.

<p>After the squeeze in the cotton market on the previous day, there were slight signs of fatigue. Yuan Yi's longs released a large amount of stock. However, most cotton merchants are still in a long position. However, spot cotton sales have been sluggish recently, and mill demand is not strong. The trading volume for August-dated contracts is approaching 110,000 bales, so a fierce battle is inevitable in the future.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Yuan released stock. The preliminary report on the bid cotton market stated that the US cotton situation was flat and that Yuan Yi's longs continued to release stock in huge quantities, causing the surface to loosen and fall by $0.03. When bidding began, Gengfeng bought again, raising the price by $0.01-0.02. When the market closed, the market price decreased due to the weak yarn price. As a result, the prices for each month fell by $0.035-$0.05 compared to the previous day's closing price. The following companies sold: Taixing 2,800 bales, Renfeng 1,000 bales, Yuan Yi 5,800 bales, Yichang 2,500 bales, Runkang 2,600 bales, Deji 1,000 bales, and Yuanxingchang 2,700 bales. The following companies bought: Dafu 2,600 bales, Gengfeng 2,600 bales, Changji 1,300 bales, Shenji 2,000 bales, Tongxing 1,400 bales, Changfeng 1,300 bales, Yongchang 1,000 bales, Yongda 1,500 bales, Yikang 1,800 bales, and Weihe 1,400 bales. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for one day are listed below.</p>
<p>The demand for cotton mills remains sluggish. Spot cotton consumption is extremely light. Mill demand is particularly sluggish. The sources were 451 bales of Yao cotton and 808 bales of general cotton.</p>
<p>The Spot Price of American Cotton Fell More</p>
<p>The American cotton market opened yesterday. The market was flat. The prices for each month fell by 1-4 points. Trading was uncertain. Sentiment was concentrated on the July contract. Later, the longs in the July contract suddenly started liquidating, and the government also released 4,000 bales. The morning's delivery notices were for 500 bales. There was little hedging. Traders were all waiting for developments. Spot demand was sluggish. Traders were unwilling to buy at the current market prices, as it was generally believed that the supply of new cotton would be more abundant. The closing price was flat and sluggish. It was estimated that the spot price fell by 25 points, and the futures price fell by 2-4 points. The spot price of British cotton rose by 2 points, and the futures price rose by 3-5 points. Indian cotton shorts had already covered, and a few exporters were buying, which was offset by the longs' liquidation. It was estimated that plain cotton rose by 1.25 rupees, Oomra rose by 0.75 rupees, and Berar Creek rose by 5 points. The original telegraphic record is on the left (25th day's telegram).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Mumbai, the opening price forecast for April/May-dated Berar Creek cotton on the 26th was 210.5 rupees, a decrease of 0.75 rupees compared to the previous day's closing price.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Securities and Bonds: Shorts Rebound, Almost Collapsing <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange only traded August-dated futures, and the price fluctuations were quite unique. Major players absorbed at low prices, and the force was still strong. Market rumors stated that the currency issue was still a case of nervous sensitivity. However, since the Hebei Incident, followed by floods, coupled with financial exhaustion, short sellers were extremely enthusiastic. What they did not know was that this had created a new trend of using deposited funds to buy government bonds. The abnormal development of the bond market was truly beyond the expectations of some people. The longs were preparing to take delivery, and the shorts had to concede. Coupled with the unexpected pull-up by the major players, the market price soared. If the major longs remained steadfast, the market price would not easily fall back. The events of yesterday were as follows: at the opening, No. 69 sold off, and the market price trended slightly weaker. Therefore, the front rows were still able to carry the momentum from the previous day, rising by $0.01-$0.04. The back rows gradually turned weaker by $0.03-$0.04 since the shortage of gold, and sentiment seemed to have weakened slightly. In the second round, the front rows slightly fell back, but Nos. 13, 14, 15, 54, and 78, etc. continued to absorb sequentially. After entering, a counter-movement started again since the shortage of gold, and the rebound was very strong. Zheng San Guan was the most up to 8.5 cents, and 96 also broke through 11 yuan. The market price advanced step by step. It is not unjustifiable. The market price increase result was $0.11-$0.50 respectively. Only 1.9 Guan was slightly worse. The total trading volume was 9.9 million yuan. The comparative list of increases and decreases is on the left (unit yuan, trading unit 100 yuan).</p>
<p>New York Preferred Stock Reaches Record High</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that the New York stock market (25th) fell and closed due to the news and the profit taking sale by speculators. However, buying on the dip surged, so the drop was limited. Utility stocks rose instead, and many preferred stocks reached this year's high records. The small exchange market was sluggish, and bond prices were mixed. The total trading volume for the day was 1.33 million shares. The Dow Jones index is listed on the left.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Grain: Northern Observation, Flour Market Silent <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market showed a slight pause in activity. This was due to the reported prices of foreign wheat, with Chicago down 8 to 10 points and Canada unchanged. Market sentiment was only slightly affected by the minor fluctuations in foreign wheat prices. For the current month, Northern buyers have turned to observation. Although manufacturers are still collecting monthly orders, they are also hedging long-term positions, leading to a generally relaxed market sentiment. However, the asking price for domestic wheat has increased by 30 to 40 cents since the beginning of the month due to exchange rates and other factors. Yesterday, monthly contracts were offered at $4.80. Given the current situation, it seems that both sides have temporarily ceased activity while awaiting a market price consensus. The result was a slight decrease of half a point for July/August small #2 wheat, no change for September, a slight decrease of half a point for October small, and a slight decrease of half a point for November/December small.</p>
<p>Clients: Many bulls exiting, futures wheat sales don't decline</p>
<p>In the futures wheat market yesterday morning, prices initially stabilized and then remained flat across all months. This was due to slightly better foreign wheat prices and stable market sentiment. Prices for all months were comparable to the previous day. However, as the flour market remained quiet, many bullish clients sold their positions, leading to a slight weakening of market sentiment. However, foreign wheat prices are already relatively high, and the downward trend seems to have stopped. The result was no change for the current month, a slight decrease of one point for August, a slight decrease of three points for September, a slight decrease of two points for October, and a slight decrease of three points for November. Due to difficulties in distinguishing the origin of current wheat, clients are selling, and high-quality wheat is being offered at 20 to 30 cents higher. Medium-grade wheat remains flat. Wheat from the Five Rivers area of Jiangbei is priced at $3.45, Wuyi wheat at $3.39, Zhenjiang wheat at $3.33-$3.34, Liuhe wheat at $3.37, Yangzhou wheat at $3.40, and Suzhou wheat at $3.45, with lower grade wheat at $3.42. Kunshan wheat is priced at $3.43, and Nanjing wheat at $3.35, with lower grade wheat at $3.29. Shanfu New moved 5,000 bags, Fufeng moved 1,000 bags, and Shenda moved 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>Imported rice sales slow, old rice drops 20-30 cents, new indica rice falls 40 cents</p>
<p>The supply of local rice (Shanghai South) was particularly abundant yesterday, reaching number 30 (totaling over 6,000 stones), leading to a further weakening of the market. Sales in the local market have virtually stopped, and transactions are very limited. However, some merchants from Tianjin and Hebei suddenly purchased over 1,000 bags of thin indica rice. Thick japonica rice fell another 10-20 cents, and medium-grade rice fell even further by 20-30 cents. The various thin indica rice varieties are also experiencing a similar situation. High-quality Yuan rice remained unchanged, while Variable Yuan rice remained unsold. Su Xin rice fell slightly by 40 cents, with a price of $10.60.</p>
<p>(In Shanghai North, new rice from Pudong was launched yesterday, with approximately 50-60 stones available per day. The rice quality is better, and retail sales are not bad, with a price of $10.60. The supply from various merchants in Hexia is about 15-16, and the white japonica rice on the market is sluggish, causing prices to fall by 20-30 cents. Early rice also followed suit. Sales of high-quality thin indica rice are still acceptable, while medium-grade rice is sluggish, with prices indicating a weak trend. Medium-grade rice is down 20-30 cents, and Zi Yuan rice is also down 20-30 cents. Other varieties are down by nearly 10 cents.</p>
<p>Imported rice trading on the market decreased again yesterday. Merchants from various local groups and the Yangtze River groups, including Nanjing and Beiyang, only engaged in routine transactions. Owners, citing high costs and firm production prices, are unwilling to sell off cheaply. The market has managed to stabilize in a soft and flat environment. The total volume offered for sale citywide was 5,000 bags of Western rice and 800 bags of Small Pattern Siamese rice, totaling less than 6,000 bags. The market is currently stable, and barring unforeseen changes, it should remain at this level.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Local Bean Cake Drops Another 3 Cents <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the bean cake market weakened again due to sluggish trading from Shantou buyers and weak sales in inland areas. Market sentiment was uncertain, causing prices to fall. Factory-made bean cake fell by 3 cents, and merchant bean cake fell slightly more. Transactions involved 2,500 pieces of current cake from various factories, priced at $1.30 to $1.39. Futures trading involved 7,000 pieces, priced at $1.17. Hankou Xingye brand #2 old-color cake totaled 20,000 pieces, priced at $1.10. Merchant bean cake totaled 6,400 pieces.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Foreign Firms and Domestic Sales Rise Together; Bran Price Increases Sharply by 10 Cents <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Since the active trading by foreign firms, the bran market has seen rising prices. At the beginning of the week, the market price was around $1.90, but recently it has been steadily increasing. This is partly due to the activity of foreign firms, which has stabilized market sentiment, and partly due to the sluggishness of domestic sales, which has led to a small number of buyers eagerly trying to replenish their supplies. As a result, the price has increased by a significant 10 cents in just a few days. Yesterday, Fufeng bran was offered at $2.0375, while Fuxin bran was not offered. In the past week or so, foreign firms have reportedly moved around 100,000 units.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the green tea market continued to be active. Many merchants from Tunxi and other areas, including Yingzhuang, Xiehe, Tongfu, Baochang, and Tianyu, were keenly interested in Zhenmei green tea, with a total of over 1,600 boxes traded. Wholesale prices for Zhenmei tea from Wuyuan merchants have reached $82, which is slightly higher than before. Since Tongfu Foreign Firm began trading Pingshui Grade #1 Pearl Tea, Xiehe, Jinlong, and other firms have also been actively purchasing, and trading is quite brisk. The market price has rebounded to $48, which is $2-$3 higher than before. Other teas, such as Zhenmei Gongxi, are also showing signs of stability.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Oil Market: Hongjiang Tung Oil Production and Sales Both Slow <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Hongjiang Tung Oil is normally in high demand during the summer season. However, during the previous winter, many local presses reduced or completely stopped production due to unrest in the area. As a result, both the inventory and supply are scarce, leading to tight market conditions. Prices for Zheng Hong Ji Chang He brand have risen the most, from $25-$26 per barrel last winter to a high of $31.45 this summer. Secondary Hongjiang oil has also increased from just over $21 to over $26, which is unprecedented in the past five to six years. However, the decrease in sales volume is also unprecedented in decades. Zheng Pi Ji Hong has reportedly loosened to $31, and secondary Hongjiang oil, such as Yang Hengyuan and Qing Yuanfeng, has dropped to $25.78.</p>

<p>The first batch of new Hainan Longan Flesh only amounted to five pieces. Initially, it was not offered due to mismatched prices. Later, it was offered via private placement, with a reported price below $40. Yesterday, the second batch of 19 pieces arrived, with good quality but some with black spots. Twelve pieces were immediately offered, slightly lower than the previous price by one dollar. With more arrivals expected, prices may decrease further.</p>

<p>The demand for prime grade tinplate has been quite good recently. However, with depleted inventory, the market is unusually strong. Sentiment has also stabilized due to the improved environment. Current market prices have increased by 25 cents to 50 cents compared to before. However, buyers have not reduced their purchases despite the higher prices. It is found that most of the buyers are local manufacturers, with relatively few buyers from other regions. Here is a list of estimated current market prices (unit: dollar):</p>

<h3 id="e190">Cultural Movement and Revolutionary Movement <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Shi</p>
<p>Just as general metaphysical idealists fail to understand the relationship between revolutionary movements and cultural movements, so too do general mechanical materialists fail to understand the relationship between cultural movements and revolutionary movements.</p>
<p>In the eyes of general mechanical materialists, cultural movements and revolutionary movements are two completely irreconcilable and opposing movements. The opposition between these two movements is like the opposition between centrifugal force and centripetal force, always repelling each other at one end.</p>
<p>Are cultural movements and revolutionary movements truly opposed? I am very skeptical of this confused assertion.</p>
<p>The first thing I want to point out to the public is that revolutionary movements are by no means a simple action that can encompass everything. Kropotkin, in his great work "The Great French Revolution," begins by saying: Two great currents prepared and brought about the French Revolution. One is the current of thought; the other is the current of action. The combination of these two currents resulted in revolution. In fact, not only the French Revolution, but all modern revolutions are the result of the convergence of ideological currents and action currents. From this point of view, isn't opposing ideological and cultural movements opposing revolutionary movements as well?</p>
<p>Secondly, all revolutions do not develop in a straight line. Especially after a revolution suffers setbacks, if the revolution wants to revive, it must go through a new stage of ideological and cultural movement.</p>
<p>Without discussing distant events, how effectively our "May Fourth" New Culture Movement revived our first revolutionary movement should still be in everyone's memory. If forgetful people have even forgotten this historical fact, then please have them read recent history.</p>
<p>In my view, the ideological and cultural movement that has just begun to unfold is not opposing the Chinese revolution; on the contrary, it is paving the way for the future Chinese revolution. After the people have gone through the practical lessons of the past six or seven years, the people not only demand a change in the current state of the nation, but also demand a change in themselves—to make their own knowledge development more suitable for future social movements. This is the true meaning of the current ideological and cultural movement. From this, it can be seen that ideological and cultural movements not only do not hinder revolution, but are the greatest preparers and organizers of future revolutions. Without it, the revolution might just die.</p>
<p>Which ideological and cultural movement in history has not been the precursor to national awakening?</p>
<p>We cannot simply view the current cultural movement from a sectarian point of view as the result of some conspiracy or strategy. We should view it from the perspective of the entire historical development as the inevitable requirement of the present historical moment. This is the manifestation of the people consciously changing the desperate and erroneous movements of the past on a larger scale. This is the manifestation of the people reopening the revolutionary ocean after the ship of revolution has sailed into a dead harbor. This is the manifestation of the people attempting to revive and grow the revolution on a national and societal scale after revolutionary alchemists who followed unorthodox paths have ruined the revolution.</p>
<p>Just as the "May Fourth Ideological and Cultural Movement" revived the dead first revolution, the current ideological and cultural movement has the great historical mission of reviving the future Chinese revolution.</p>
<p>Past mistakes, and the serious consequences resulting from these mistakes, have not only brought the people to a loss, but have even led the people to a state of numbness and apathy. The heart of the nation has fallen into a state of paralysis. How can you ask its limbs to dance for you? Can you use the manipulative techniques of a puppeteer to make them dance for you without using the enlightening means of an ideological and cultural movement? As we know, puppeteers can use their unique techniques to make puppets make gestures to the audience, but this is by no means a pure and great historical drama, but merely a performance by江湖 entertainers!</p>
<p>Indiscriminately opposing cultural movements, and even opposing reading and literacy movements, is a completely soulless act. It is the most sad, morbid, tyrannical, and despicable manifestation of arrogance in this era. I hope that this kind of performance will never happen again.</p>
<p>In my view, developing the current ideological and cultural movement and raising the national level of knowledge is not only necessary for the revival of the Chinese revolution, but also very necessary for those backward, functionally atrophied revolutionary alchemists.</p>

<p>— Qi Zhong</p>
<p>Typesetting</p>
<p>Entering the typesetting room, one sees rows and rows of type cases, arranged like elementary school students lining up, containing type sizes such as No. 1, No. 2, No. 3, No. 4, No. 5, and No. 6, just like the grades from first to sixth in elementary school. The most widely used are No. 5 and No. 6 types. The arrangement of these rows of type cases is based on the radicals in the dictionary, with slight modifications. When we outsiders go up and want to find a required character, we spend half a day without success. The skilled workers, however, run around to retrieve the characters and can pick up about eight hundred characters per hour, which will undoubtedly surprise you.</p>
<p>In addition to the type cases, there are also trays and trays of "punctuation marks," "symbols," "blank leads," "lead strips," and "lead wires," arranged on the table. Skilled workers do not even need to look at them with their eyes, but simply pick them up with their hands. These are prepared for page makeup.</p>
<p>The first step in typesetting is "character retrieval" (called "picking rough castings" in their workshop). A specialized character retrieval worker, according to the type size specified on the original manuscript, takes the required characters from the type case and places them one by one in the type box, according to the predetermined number of characters per line. If a character is not in the type case or cannot be found temporarily, a blank lead or ink chip is placed there, or another character is placed upside down or sideways, for correction after proofreading. After the character retrieval worker retrieves the characters, another worker adds punctuation marks and embeds lead strips and lead wires to make it the same size as the predetermined page opening. This is called page makeup. After the page is made up, it is sent to the proofing frame to print a sample, which is sent to the proofreader to proofread according to the original manuscript.</p>
<p>Here, I will say a few more words about machine typesetting: What I said before was Chinese typesetting. As for typesetting Western languages, because Western languages have only a small number of letters, manual typesetting does not require the character retrieval worker to run around like Chinese typesetting. They can sit down and work. As for machine typesetting, it is like typing on a typewriter. As you type the original text, new lead characters are cast one by one and jump out to be arranged for you in the character box. Therefore, this kind of typesetting machine does not require pre-casting lead characters; they are all cast temporarily. Some people have tried to invent a machine for typesetting Chinese characters using this method, but after all, because Chinese characters are not phonetic and there are too many characters, they could not invent it, which shows that Chinese characters do need to be improved.</p>
<p>Proofreading</p>
<p>The first step of proofreading is called "rough proofreading," which is usually handled by the typesetting room. This rough proofreading is only to correct the missing characters on the sample, so that the sample does not become full of black dots. As for the style, etc., that is not their concern. This kind of rough proofreading work,</p>
<p>Reader, you will say that proofreading is just correcting typos, this work is very easy. However, reader, if you think so, that is wrong; because the proofs are not very clear, it is easy to make people dizzy. We often see books that are printed very clearly, but there is often a typo in them that we look over without noticing. How can looking at a proof full of typos not make people dizzy! If a printing bureau does not have a "troubleshooting" rough proofreading master, then the proofreaders will certainly be even more miserable!</p>
<p>Ordinary proofreading is mostly done three times. The first time is called the first proofreading. The proofreader unfolds the proof and looks at the original manuscript character by character. The wrong characters are corrected, the extra characters are deleted, and the omissions are added. At the same time, attention must also be paid to the format and page opening. This first proofreading is the most painful, because there are many typos, which easily make people dizzy. After the proofreading is done, the proof is sent back to the printing bureau, and the printing bureau corrects them one by one, and then prints another sample to send back for proofreading. This is called the second proofreading. The second proofreading is much easier, although there are still inevitably "problems" and typos, but it is not as chaotic as the first proofreading, so proofreading is also easier. However, if the proofreader does not know the proofreading skills, and the correction symbols used cannot be understood by the workers, then you proofread yours, and they correct theirs, resulting in the same mess, still like the first proofreading before it was proofread. It still makes people dizzy. The second proofreading is sent back to the printing bureau, corrected and sent back for proofreading, which is called the third proofreading. If the proofreading is good, there are not many typos in the third proofreading, and it can be signed. However, if a typo was missed during the second proofreading, it can still be corrected. Therefore, the responsibility of the personnel in the third proofreading is very great. However, if a typo is missed in the third proofreading, and you have already signed it and made the paper plates, then there is no way to correct it, and you can only wait until the paper plates are made before digging and correcting them on the paper plates. However, it doesn't matter if you occasionally correct one character on the paper plate, but it is troublesome to correct too many; because correcting paper plates is charged per character. As for the format, it cannot be changed on the paper plate. Therefore, the responsibility of the personnel in the third proofreading is truly great!</p>
<p>Model Making</p>
<p>After the manuscript has been proofread, lead type is used to make paper plates. This is called "model making." Model making is an important step in preparing to print a book, because it is very inconvenient to send the pages typeset with movable type to the machine for printing; moreover, putting so many lead characters on the machine for printing will cause the typesetting room to feel short of resources, and the work will inevitably be affected; furthermore, the lead characters will naturally be damaged by the heavy pressure of the machine during printing, and soon the characters will become blurred and unusable. They become a pile of scrap lead and must be returned to the furnace for melting and recasting new characters, which is a great loss! Also, if you have spent a lot of effort typesetting a page and printed the first edition of a new book, if you don't have paper plates, you must re-typeset and re-proofread, which is not only time-consuming but also expensive. Therefore, making paper plates means that when you reprint, you only need to take out the paper plates and cast them into lead plates. Wouldn't that kill several birds with one stone! Therefore, making paper plates from typeset pages is an indispensable step. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e192">Introducing a Lively Book on Studying Chemistry <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Ren You</p>
<p>"Chemical Curiosities," translated by Gu Junzheng, written by Fabre.</p>
<p>Kaiming Publishing Price 90 cents</p>
<p>Most of our educational circles are immersed in dead books. Teachers lecture like gramophones according to the textbooks, and students record the sound like gourds, which is called being a good student. But if you send this good student to a laboratory, he will not know what to do. This is because education has not yet integrated learning and application, especially in the sciences. To solve this difficulty, I would like to solemnly introduce "Chemical Curiosities" to our readers.</p>
<p>Everyone says that chemistry is a boring and difficult subject, but "Chemical Curiosities" gives every reader a wealth of interest. The author writes about mysterious chemistry through the interesting dialogue of the lovable Emile and Jules with their uncle Paul. When we see Uncle Paul's earnest, novel, and loving attitude, this book will make us feel interested in studying. Of course, Fabre would not have been able to write this book if he had not had literary cultivation.</p>
<p>For example, in the third chapter, when he talks about carbon, he does not start from carbon, but starts from a piece of burnt bread to薇, which is so 引人 嚼味!</p>
<p>Also, when he talks about the meaning of chemical combination, he says:</p>
<p>"What does sulfur and iron become after they get married? We cannot call it sulfur, because it is no longer sulfur; we cannot call it iron, because it is no longer iron; we cannot say that it is a mixture of sulfur and iron, because although it was initially a mixture, it is no longer a mixture later. This thing is chemically called iron sulfide, and this term reminds us that these two substances are combined under the constraints of chemical marriage."</p>
<p>He calls chemical combination marriage, which is the most appropriate metaphor. He also比喩 the heat, light, explosion, crackling, and sparks produced during chemical reactions as firecrackers and lanterns to celebrate their marriage, isn't that very interesting?</p>
<p>Mr. Ye Shaojun's preface to this book is the most thorough:</p>
<p>"Although this book, 'Chemical Curiosities,' is also a book, it is not a book to be read, nor is it a book to be 'memorized.' The original author, Fabre, skillfully used his pen to depict the efforts of the '赋' character, so that readers not only have chemical knowledge, but also can do chemical experiments, and at the same time increase their ability to try, which can be used to deal with other things. 'Chemistry'—this term is so boring and tasteless when written on the curriculum, but in this book it is almost the most touching story. 'I can do it like Jules Emile!' the reader will think, and because the experimental equipment is 'readily available' or self-made, the reader will immediately 'do it himself' according to what the book says. And do it more creatively."</p>
<p>"Whoever only 'reads' or 'memorizes' this book is letting this book down."</p>
<p>Young friends who need wisdom, remember this sentence and read this interesting book.</p>
<p>Editor's note: The reason why books on natural science are not very popular in our country is mainly because they are boring and tasteless, not only the theories, but mainly the writing style. Therefore, if we want to popularize natural science knowledge among the general public, we must make this kind of explanatory writing interesting and literary. This requires the reform of the writing style. The editor dares to raise this issue here, hoping to arouse public discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Neurasthenia <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>Brain Neurasthenia: The brain is the main organ of a person. The exercise of will is all commanded by the pivotal organ. If the brainpower is not strong, everything cannot be fully developed. If hereditary syphilis or alcohol poisoning damages the central nervous system, resulting in dementia (loss of consciousness) and becoming ignorant and insensible, happiness is lost. How can one be human? Brain damage is critical to health. The impact on lifelong happiness is significant. Many modern young people also suffer from neurasthenia. Although the occurrence of this symptom is sometimes due to the destruction of bad habits, it is also caused by congenital deficiency and acquired imbalance. In addition, those who study too hard, work excessively, and are overly sensitive are all at risk of developing this symptom. If ignored arbitrarily, or even excessively harming oneself, it will eventually become an incurable disease.</p>
<p>Sexual Neurasthenia: The irrigation of plants depends on fertilizer, and the cultivation of the human body depends on nutrients. The underdevelopment of reproductive organs is one of these factors. In the end, all blame falls on the parents. When a person is a child, responsibility falls on the parents. Originally, children could have perfect physical health and complete development without any problems, except for paying attention to nutrition and digestion. Unfortunately, from childhood to adulthood, parents do not pay attention and let them develop naturally, resulting in habitual bad habits. How many young people lose their ambition! If attention is paid in advance to investigate whether there are any symptoms or physiological changes, it should be distinguished clearly and corrected early, so that happiness can be maintained. Now, observing young people with weak wills, whose bodies are generally healthy, recklessly engaging in non-actions during the developmental period, their bodies gradually become thin and weak, eventually developing neurasthenia. Symptoms such as poor memory, small reproductive organs, and all phenomena of sexual dysfunction appear immediately. When treating this symptom, in addition to the use of drug treatment, the application of electrotherapy is an indispensable and necessary auxiliary.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Eczema <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Wu Sheng</p>
<p>The areas where eczema is most likely to occur are usually in the joints and genital area, such as the inner thighs, around the scrotum, and the inner side of the upper brain. Sometimes it is scattered on the limbs.</p>
<p>When this symptom occurs, the skin usually feels itchy, burning, and swollen first. Next, papules the size of pinheads develop, gradually turning into blisters. There are also exceptions, either rupturing or forming soft scabs. It is stubborn and difficult to treat.</p>
<p>The causes of this symptom are mostly unclean skin, parasitic bacteria, glandular nausea liquid, and blood circulation disorders. However, it is also due to chemical, thermal, and mechanical stimulation, such as hard laborers being most susceptible to this disease. It is also due to anemia, chlorosis, and diabetes, but it is very rare.</p>
<p>Treatment of this symptom mostly focuses on local treatment. The overall condition must also be considered. For local therapy, it is best to avoid using alcohol-based liquid medicines, as they stimulate the peeling of the epidermis, not only are ineffective, but also harmful. At this time, it is best to use ointments or oils. The MIDULZINE sold by the Ren Shou Western Drug Store at No. 1 Lao De Xing Li, next to the French School in Bāxiānqiáo, French Concession, is made with the most chemical preparations. This medicine combines all the medicines that destroy skin bacteria and promote skin resistance. It is effective for all kinds of tinea infections. What is not known is that it can quickly work for eczema. Applying this medicine to various other skin diseases also yields good results.</p>
<h3 id="e195">The Significance of Quitting Opium <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— She Lei</p>
<p>Those addicted to opium invariably possess within their bodies elements that resist and neutralize the drug. These elements arise from the habitual effects of opium, produced by the resistance and decomposition of its toxins. Once these elements are present, opium becomes indispensable. In medical terms, this is referred to as chronic opium poisoning, or what is commonly known as addiction. The significance of quitting opium lies in the means of eliminating these elements. Once these elements are removed, the individual returns to a state no different from that of an ordinary person. Previously, the reduction was passive; now, it is a natural elimination. The pain and pleasure of withdrawal, the length and brevity of the withdrawal period, can be known without the need for extensive deliberation. With serum-based opium withdrawal, there is no pain, the withdrawal period is short, and relapse is impossible. The severity of the addiction, the number of years addicted, or addiction due to illness and bodily weakness, are no impediments to quitting opium. If nutritional supplements such as egg yolk lecithin, phosformentin, lecithin, and formicine are administered simultaneously, the joyful expression is no less than when smoking.</p>

<p>— Dr. Liu Xuan Nu</p>
<p>(1) Diagnosis During the Latent Period: Collect secretions from the patient's urethra, the external os of the uterus, or the uterine cavity using platinum or silver wire. Prepare a smear specimen, stain it, and examine it under a microscope. This will reveal the presence of pathogens and numerous epithelial cells.</p>
<p>(2) Diagnosis During the Prodromal Period: Examine smear specimens collected from various locations using the method described above. Specimens taken from the urethra will reveal the presence of pathogens, epithelial cells, and a small amount of mucus. Specimens taken from the genital organs, specifically the cervical os and the uterine cavity, will show similar findings, but with a greater number of pathogens.</p>
<p>(3) Diagnosis During the Purulent Discharge Period: During this period, a large amount of pus can be seen with the naked eye at the external urethral orifice and within the uterine cavity. Microscopic examination of the epithelial cells from the urethral orifice can confirm the diagnosis of gonorrhea. When gonorrhea is limited to the urethra, the two-glass test is used. Turbidity in the first glass of urine indicates urethritis, while turbidity in the second glass indicates cystitis, pyelitis, or nephritis. For the latter conditions, a three- or four-glass test is used, where all glasses of urine appear turbid.</p>
<h3 id="e197">A Discussion on the Treatment of Gonorrhea <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Cui Fuqing</p>
<p>Gonorrhea, commonly known as "white turbidity," accounts for sixty to seventy percent of venereal diseases. It is generally understood to result from unclean sexual intercourse between men and women, or from frequenting brothels. It is caused by a gonococcal bacterium that invades the mucous membrane of the male urethra or the cervix of the female uterus. This bacterium has a strong reproductive capability, quickly causing urinary tract disturbances. Initial symptoms include urethral burning, painful urination, cloudy urine, tissue swelling, and the secretion of a pus-like fluid, or even bleeding, accompanied by a high fever. This is known as acute gonorrhea. If not treated properly, the gonococci will invade the deeper parts of the urethra, leading to chronic gonorrhea. Although the symptoms may appear to subside, with reduced secretion and pain, the root of the disease deepens. The bacteria lie dormant in the deep urethra, and cannot be eradicated by medication in a short time, resulting in lifelong harm, or even sterility and death. Currently, most physicians treating gonorrhea use intravenous injections of yellow dye, or vaginal irrigations with silver protein, Rivarol solutions, such as RERGON, ARGNON, and HEGONON. These treatments can achieve considerable results, but their effectiveness is slow and the issue of complete eradication remains questionable. Injections of yellow dye, typically a 0.5% solution, administered at 10 to 20 cc per injection, can cause nausea and toxic symptoms due to the patient's constitution. Rapid injections can trigger severe acute poisoning, posing considerable danger and requiring careful consideration. In recent years, medicine has advanced rapidly, becoming increasingly refined, thanks to the promotion of science. For example, the shortwave diathermy used at the Chun Zai Hospital at No. 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, and MESALTROPIN (Gonorrhea Reduction Tablets) sold by Ren Shou Western Pharmacy at No. 1, Laodexing Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao in the French Concession, are particularly effective for treating acute and chronic gonorrhea in both men and women, as well as all conditions caused by gonorrhea. Furthermore, GONO-SEROL serum, a new product from the German Munel Zhi foreign firm, is an effective medicine for treating gonococcal urethritis. It is easy to use, painless, and can reach the folds of the mucosa and the small fissures within the urethra, allowing the bacteria on the surface and in the deeper layers to be killed simultaneously. In addition to treatment, it also helps prevent "white candles" [a slang term for advanced stages of gonorrhea].</p>

<p>My wife, Jian Yao, has suffered from stomach ailments for seven or eight years, recurring intermittently. Treatment by both Chinese and Western doctors only brought temporary relief. The longer the ailment lingered, the greater the suffering. Later, through the introduction of my friend, Mr. Wang Lenian, we consulted Dr. Ma Fangweng. Dr. Ma treated her with shortwave diathermy for seven sessions. In addition, he prescribed Wei Bao [Stomach Treasure] from Ren Shou Western Pharmacy at No. 1, Laodexing Lane, next to the French School in Baxianqiao, French Concession (i.e., Mintiniyin Road), which she took for three boxes. The cost was only six yuan. After taking it for about ten days, her illness disappeared as if lost. Half a year has passed and she has not relapsed. Such a good doctor, such a good medicine, deserve to be praised, so that those suffering from this ailment can be spared the pain.</p>

<p>Quit Once Before</p>
<p>I have been addicted to opium for over ten years, simply out of habit, without any underlying health problems. I quit once in the winter of 1929 [Republican Year 18]. The doctor gave me injections and daily oral medication. For about ten days, I felt quite comfortable, but afterwards, I experienced weakness in my limbs and diarrhea, leading me to discontinue the treatment. Your journal's service to society is admirable. I hope you can recommend a good doctor to help me break free from this addiction (Question from Mr. Wu Xiangyun).</p>
<p>(Answer) Dr. She Lei at Chun Zai Hospital, No. 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city, uses the latest serum-based opium withdrawal method, supplemented with nutritional injections such as egg yolk lecithin, phosformentin, lecithin, and formicine. The withdrawal process is comfortable and stable, and the withdrawal period is extremely short. The fees at Chun Zai Hospital are also very reasonable, costing only two yuan per day, including medication and injections. Many have successfully quit under his care. You can go there for treatment.</p>
<p>Never Relapsed</p>
<p>(Question from Zheng Zhujun) I had gonorrhea last year and have not relapsed since. Recently, however, I have again noticed a pus-like discharge. I usually work very hard, but I have not engaged in prostitution. Is this a relapse of gonorrhea? Please advise on the details. What medicine is effective, and which hospital offers the fastest treatment?</p>
<p>(Answer) Your condition is undoubtedly a relapse due to overexertion and incomplete treatment of your gonorrhea. You should rest and recuperate. Chun Zai Hospital, No. 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city, has advanced gonorrhea treatment equipment, including shortwave diathermy and the latest gonorrhea treatment machines. They employ expert physicians specializing in internal medicine, dermatology, and venereal diseases. They use world-renowned medications and provide reliable treatment at reasonable prices. You can go there for diagnosis and treatment. If you prefer to self-treat, please purchase Gonorrhea Reduction Tablets for oral use and GONO-SEROL for external use. Both medications are sold by Ren Shou Western Pharmacy at No. 1, Laodexing Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao in the French Concession of this city. The former costs one yuan per box, and the latter costs two yuan and fifty cents per bottle. Add one cent for postage to other locations.</p>
<p>Difficulty Walking</p>
<p>(Question from Mr. Yu Jixing) This spring, my feet swelled, but they recovered after treatment. Recently, my toes have been extremely itchy and developed blisters. When broken, they become eroded when exposed to water, making it difficult to walk. I then purchased and applied Anti-Germicide from Ren Shou Western Pharmacy at No. 1, Laodexing Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao in the French Concession, and it healed. I have some of it left. My friend has a stubborn sore. Can he use the remaining Anti-Germicide?</p>
<p>(Answer) Anti-Germicide is specially formulated for various skin diseases, and is particularly effective for treating scabies, sores, and ringworm. Its effectiveness has been increasingly confirmed since Dr. Wu Sheng started using it in his practice. It can be used for all skin conditions with curative effect. Your friend can certainly use it for his sore.</p>
<p>Nocturnal Emission</p>
<p>(Question from Cai Bingsheng) Thanks to your journal's recommendation, my nocturnal emission problem has been cured by AROLSEN Tablets from Ren Shou Western Pharmacy at No. 1, Laodexing Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao in the French Concession of this city. Now, Mr. Qi Yang, a friend of mine, is suffering from neurasthenia. I wonder if he can take the same medication, and please recommend a good doctor.</p>
<p>(Answer) AROLSEN is specifically formulated for treating neurasthenia. Your friend can purchase and take it. As for seeking medical treatment, it is necessary to see an expert physician for effective and rapid results. Dr. Feng Shanliang at Chun Zai Hospital, No. 66 Ningbo Road in the French Concession of this city, is skilled in treating neurasthenia. You can go there for consultation.</p>
<p>Years of Stomach Ailments</p>
<p>(Question from Wu Zhihua) Since childhood, I have mistakenly eaten raw and cold foods and indulged in spicy and stimulating foods, resulting in stomach ailments at an early age. Although I have sought treatment from famous Chinese and Western doctors, I have not been able to eradicate the problem, and it continues to cause me great suffering. I heard that my relative's stomach ailment was cured after your journal recommended Wei Bao from Ren Shou Western Pharmacy at No. 1, Laodexing Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao in the French Concession of this city. I wonder if I can take it for my ailments.</p>
<p>(Answer) Wei Bao is a specially formulated treatment for chronic gastritis. Dr. Ma Fangweng has strongly advocated for this medicine, further confirming its remarkable and reliable effectiveness. It is effective for treating stomach pain, bloating, vomiting, and regurgitation. You can quickly purchase and take it.</p>

<h3 id="e200">The Problem of Medical Treatment for the Poor <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>I recently read a Nanjing news report stating: The Municipal Party Department sent a letter to the Municipal Government stating that many doctors in the city were outwardly complying with the standard fee schedule set by the Municipal Government but secretly increasing their charges. It requested strict enforcement and ordered the Health Bureau to conduct regular investigations. Those who do not adhere to the fee schedule and arbitrarily charge more than the prescribed amount should be strictly punished. This is truly a meritorious act.</p>
<p>In addition to the necessary expenses for food, clothing, and shelter, medical expenses are also an indispensable part of a person's living expenses. It is difficult to bear the discomfort of hunger, but the suffering of physical imbalance without medication is even more unbearable. As the saying goes, "Heaven has unpredictable winds and clouds, and people have unexpected misfortunes." Those with strong bodies can still manage, but those with weak bodies are constantly susceptible to disease. The importance of medical expenses is evident.</p>
<p>However, seeing a doctor and taking medicine is not easy. The "not easy" here naturally refers to the majority of poor people. Wealthy people take tonics even when they are not sick, which is a different matter. Perhaps the situation is better in other places, but the high cost of medical care in Shanghai is simply daunting. Needless to say, those with doctorates or famous doctors are not catering to the poor. Even ordinary doctors charge three or two yuan for a consultation, and at least one yuan. Adding the cost of medicine, trying to invite one to come home and see you, the house-call fee is three to five times higher than the consultation fee, plus travel expenses. Sometimes the doctor considers it necessary and gives you one or two injections, the cost of which can be unbearable.</p>
<p>But illness is unavoidable for everyone, which is truly life-threatening. Many poor people cannot afford to see a doctor when they are sick, so they have to struggle with their illness using their own bodies. Surviving is a matter of luck, and not resisting is a matter of fate.</p>
<p>However, there are some charitable organizations in Shanghai that provide free clinics for the poor, not only providing free consultations but also dispensing medicine. They are indeed benefiting the poor, but it is said that many of these clinics are poorly equipped and the consultations are perfunctory. As a result, some people are reluctant to seek help even when they are sick. This really needs to be improved. It should be understood that charitable work should also be done to a considerable degree. We cannot be perfunctory just because we are providing free consultations. We hope that the municipal authorities can build more hospitals for the poor in Shanghai, providing completely free consultations and medications. This would be a very good social undertaking.</p>
<h3 id="e201">The Philosopher <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Kemin</p>
<p>—— Sketches of Characters</p>
<p>On the bustling streets in the noisy areas, in the dark corners of the metropolis, in the street-facing windows of low-grade lodgings, or even on the bare sidewalks, a frighteningly small shop front is set up, with elegant titles like "Lay Buddhist" or "Traveler" displayed. Outside, there is a jumbled display of portraits of Song Hongwu, Li Yuanhong, and the great Chinese leader Sun Yat-sen, along with fate charts covered with red circles and detailed annotations, mysterious arrangements of stems and branches, and jargon from the world of fortune-telling. A sign hangs: "Philosopher – Shanren [Hermit] Fortune-Telling Hall"; and on another sign, one sees the cost of the "Philosopher's" services: "Palm Reading Half Yuan, Fate Reading One Yuan..." In addition, there is the "Philosopher" who advertises "Scientific and Philosophical Fortune Telling."</p>
<p>Like all the leftover literate figures in the officialdom, a long gown is very important to them; with it, they can distinguish themselves from the "common people," putting themselves in a higher position than some laborers, desperately squeezing themselves into the ranks of "scholars," squeezing themselves into the circle of "visiting merchants, high-class ladies."</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>.</p>
<p>Yes, from there, they play the role of "men of letters," taking advantage of the difficulties in this increasingly desolate world, taking advantage of the mentality of the petty bourgeoisie who grow up in fatalism. In titles like "Lay Buddhist," "Hermit," "Philosopher," they breathe and write like parasites on a rotten leaf, living from day to day with less and less certainty.</p>
<p>However, it is said that the "Philosopher" may have studied in private schools, primary schools, or middle schools when he was young. Following the old teacher to study the Four Books, the Book of Changes, and the Zuo Zhuan; a scholar is also a "scholar"! But, growing up, relying on empty "words," he cannot make a living in business, and he lacks practical skills. Drifting, floating; fortunately, the people of this ancient country all believe in relying on Heaven for food and on fate for life, so this path may be passable. So, he must first spend hundreds of days "doing" a hand of writing that seems to be "dragons flying and phoenixes dancing," mastering the "jia yi bing ding" [the ten Heavenly Stems], understanding the jargon of the fortune-telling world, raising capital, and setting up the scene. Then, he sits inside, waiting for the believers of fatalism: the disappointed, the struggling, the doubtful and wandering, those who have lost their reason in the inevitable decline of this era... Then, questioning and "pointing out," at this time, the genius of "alertness" is needed, and the skill of "observing words and discerning colors" is also needed. The "Philosopher" must also be a "psychologist," using such "talent" to persuade and intimidate those weak fatalists, trying to gain greater profits from others' desire for security and avoidance of trouble. They live on, live on.</p>
<p>However, times are really bad, and this business is also difficult to do. They have to cope with the competition from the same industry and think of some novel tricks. Recently, even for a devout believer in fatalism, the strange-shaped portrait of Zhu Hongwu and his "True Son of Heaven" "eight characters" are no longer attractive – these days, everything must be new! So, when others put up the sign of "First-Class Literary Doctor," one must also think of a "Philosopher" and "Scientific Fortune Teller" to muddle through. But, no matter how many tricks there are, it is true that business is difficult these days: even if people want to know when they are destined to get rich, the cost of a few cents is enough to think about. In this world, money is the most real.</p>
<p>For this reason, our "Philosopher" must also plan and start "Dog Racing Winning Method" and "Aviation Lottery Purchasing Method" to grab another group of customers, another group of people.</p>
<p>But, what the "Philosopher" can't understand most is: "He is also a scholar, and he doesn't even have a good meal."</p>
<p>This is a "philosophy" that even the "philosopher" does not understand!</p>

<h3 id="e203">A Small Feeling Looking at Clouds <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Tianshe</p>
<p>I love clouds. Summer is the season of clouds. I love watching the illusions of clouds. The clouds of summer evenings are extraordinarily mysterious and rapidly changing. Each posture of each cloud will not be maintained for even half a minute. When a plein air painter wants to depict a summer evening wilderness, how sensitive a vision and rapid a brushstroke he must use! Moreover, the colors of the summer evening clouds are very complex. Perhaps sometimes the palette will be stumped by the artificial colors used to adapt to the illusions of nature. Even the transcendent artist will inevitably encounter occasional difficulties!</p>
<p>When I was a child in the countryside, I took a bath on summer evenings, lightly wore a beige coarse summer cloth tunic and shorts, put on small wooden clogs, sat on a low bamboo stool in the field, and my mother peeled green beans on the side. The cool breeze shook down from the top of that old cassia tree, carrying the green scent of the leaves. I leisurely held a palm fan that was not needed and watched the sky, watched the floating clouds in the sky. Relying on my own imagination, I would see those clouds as various people or animals. When I was in a daze, I would shout out: "Mom, isn't that a bullock cart over there!"</p>
<p>When my mother was happy, she would also look up. The glow of the sunset illuminated her smooth forehead. Her eyes were green, and there were clouds flowing inside. At that time, my mother was still in her prime. When I pointed to a cloud, dragged her arm, and leaned on her shoulder, entwining with her, she would pretend to be angry and say: "I think you're going to turn into a fool." But in the end, she would always smile so kindly, which I understood. I still wanted to entwine with her: "Mom, isn't that an old woman carrying a load over there." Pointing to the sky.</p>
<p>But, mother gradually aged in the drifting of the clouds. Now, she will not say to me: "The clouds are released from the valley, and the immortals still take them back into the valley." This kind of myth. She still lives with a sickly body hidden in her distant coastal hometown, but I have been blown by the storms of life into this city. Many of my childhood temperaments have been completely lost along the way, and my circumstances are just like the floating clouds of summer evenings, without even a chance to appreciate them for a while, not at all...</p>
<p>"Unfeeling floating clouds, unfeeling years!"</p>
<p>Every time I think about it, I will sigh like this, especially on these summer evenings. I roll up the curtains of the small building, let my tired body after running around during the day lean on the window lattice, hold a cheap cigarette, and, in the bitter taste, look up at the flowing clouds in the sky. To this day, only the interest in watching the clouds has not diminished. I want to reflect my drifting life from the clouds, but my house is too low. In the city, it is not easy to get a wide sky. People living in the city also do not easily have an open mind. Thus, as soon as the bright sunlight comes, it is obscured by the clouds, and the eyes feel a gloom.</p>
<p>"Is that gray cloud floating from the sea sky of my hometown? Has it also passed over the head of my elderly mother? ...Has my mother ever looked up at it, and known that that cloud is going to drift to her son's eyes thousands of miles away?"…</p>
<p>I often question myself like this in my brain.</p>
<p>The taste of the cigarette feels more bitter. I feel that each stage of life is just like the dispersion and illusion of clouds, and will never return to its original state. No one can predict what kind of shape the peony-shaped floating cloud will turn into. Sighing is also useless. You still have to guard against the sudden arrival of a great wind.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Night Flight <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Tuan</p>
<p>That day, from dusk, the sky began to gloomily spread out black clouds. Then came terrifying thunder and lightning. Finally, a necessary and unavoidable downpour fell as if poured from the sky.</p>
<p>The heavy rain kept falling, hitting the iron roof of the small house, as rapid as the drums on a battlefield, stirring up people's hearts like swirling muddy water. Looking at the sky, the rain continued to fall, as if vowing to pour down all the moisture that had been lingering in the sky for so long, not leaving a single drop. It was already late at night, yet the rain showed no sign of stopping. However, to me, it seemed like it didn't matter anymore. For the sake of life, I had to immediately throw myself out of the rain-soaked door in the deep night, and head towards the metropolis hundreds of miles away. All the attachments and reluctance had been completely shattered in the search for a livelihood. I had to brave the darkness of the night, the rain of the night, and throw myself out.</p>
<p>My wife blessed me, packed my luggage, put a raincoat on me, lit the hand lantern to illuminate the dark alley, opened the door for me, and entrusted me with laughter and tears to take care of myself. And I, certainly, had to rush without hesitation into the land of the night.</p>
<p>(There's no need to say any more about love, affection, and other such terms. We are both young—yes. But haven't we learned enough from the hardships of life in the past year or two? People shouldn't have feelings—why should people have them? How happy a person would be without feelings...)</p>
<p>When we were young (but is it old age now?), we all had a pair of eyes and a soul. And when we discovered that this world was not very suitable for those with eyes and souls to live in, we all acted childishly in the face of life, made up our minds, and resolutely broke away from the repulsive face of the world, stubbornly coming to this simple place, intending to use our own labor and enthusiasm as fertilizer to irrigate this even simple life. It doesn't have to be a successful and lush tree; even the finest young sprout would be satisfying.</p>
<p>However, "What a silly idea!" People of this era are very concerned about life and do not pay attention to anything outside of it. (Within the circle of life, they are refined, sensitive, cunning, and capable; but outside the circle of life, they are fools and ignorant people, they are...) So, the days went by, and life became more and more difficult. At this time, the world understood people, and people also understood the world.</p>
<p>But the meaning of life is "to eat," and not just willow-like floating catkins! In these days, two young people have suffered enough for the sake of life. When there is no longer a chance to remember the ugliness of the world, people have already hesitated on the edge of hunger and no longer think about anything.</p>
<p>Then understand: It should be a time to worry again. We are no longer the smallest children, fearing the outside world, even if it is without sin, but it is dangerous—life never lies or jokes with people, it deals with people with a straight face!</p>
<p>In this way, what else is there to miss other than the days to come—whether it is terrible, ugly, or the suffering of difficult parting, life requires you to drift away, and people cannot (or should not) resist, yes!</p>
<p>Learning to be without feeling, I think, may not be difficult? And it is said that being without feeling is often happiness. Then, what does the night, the heavy rain, or the tears of farewell from family members have to do with anything? The night is spread out endlessly outside, the rain still hasn't stopped, the road is dark and muddy, and I, finally braving the rain, braving the night, have run far away.</p>

<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Su wrote from Wusong, saying: "Come! Although you are panting in the heat wave of one hundred and one degrees, here, we are living in two seasons. Summer is a fully dressed young woman. Why are you losing the opportunity to be intimate with her? We have cicada songs, sunlight, and green sea water here. At night, there is even a half-moon. Come, come!"</p>
<p>Because of the charm of that bridge, I brought some light luggage and was taken to Wusong by a small steam train.</p>
<p>The scenery of the seaside is extremely poetic. Su and I walked on the small path of fine gravel. The lush grass brushed my clothes. Above was the eternally still blue sky. In the distance was the vast, endless sea with fine waves. At the junction of the sky and the sea, a few white sails were lazily moving forward in the breeze. A touch of purple in the sunset glow was extremely beautiful. In the reflected light, all the houses, roads, leaves, people, and livestock were covered with a strange and fascinating golden color. I felt like I was walking into a landscape painting with the confusing mood of a Dutch painter.</p>
<p>In the evening, everyone wandered on the coast, watching the sky darken so lovely (not terribly). The sea, the shore, and the people on the shore were all lost in the misty night fog. Along the snake-like long dike made of stone slabs, with a slightly hopeful mood, counting the quiet stone slabs, we walked past, like a hero in a myth, searching for the treasure guarded by demons in an unknown land. The seawater was churning day and night, gnawing at the rocks at the foot of the dike, playing wonderful music like cymbals and drums. Sitting quietly at the end of the long dike, listening to the endless waves surging under my feet, watching the stars shining, appearing, disappearing, and falling in the clear July sky, I seemed to be reciting a harmonious poem composed of the universe and all things. The sea breeze slowly blew from the direction of the weather station, carrying the singing of someone, I tilted my head and listened quietly, the more I listened, the more I felt intoxicated. The sad melody almost blended with the current scenery. When the singing stopped and I turned my head, we were surrounded by the hazy moonlight at some point.</p>
<p>On such a bright moonlit night, sitting in such a secluded corner of the sea where no one can reach, listening to the songs of even people, without saying a word, we suspected that we were having an ancient and magical dream!</p>
<p>In the dream, the great Shanghai, encompassing millions of people, was spewing venomous snake-like flames into the sky. That corner of the sky was entirely red. Under the red light, countless people were singing, crying, enjoying themselves, committing crimes, suffering, and harboring hope—an eternal struggle of life that continues uninterrupted...</p>
<p>What shattered our fantasies was an incomparably huge steamship, rushing out of the sea mouth like a behemoth, emitting smoke. The smoke and the night fog curled together. All that could be seen was the lights on the ship. With just one stop, we heard a heavy anchoring sound like a roar. The sound seemed to shake everything around. In an instant, it returned to silence. Our fantasies were resurrected again with the gentle call of the sea waves.</p>

<p>Since the organization of the Great Nature Singing Troupe in March, it has broadcast special programs on major radio stations and has been well received by all walks of life. Recently, many listeners have written letters requesting to join. In order to connect listeners' singing interests, the troupe welcomes those who have a good impression of the troupe to join. Please first send a letter to Miss Mary, Post Office Box 157. If suitable, you will be invited for an interview.</p>
<p>The Vienna Music Singing Society, organized by Mr. Zhang Yilu, will soon broadcast the latest famous movie songs. The society previously appointed Mr. Ma Bo as the leader, Mr. Xiao Peilin as the social director, and Mr. Ni Bao and Mr. Ni Maozhang as the officers. The female singers hired include Miss Zhang Yan, Lv Yin, Liao Yan, Ni Ying, etc. The orchestra specially hired the famous Mr. Zhu Xing to guide. It is understood that the society wants to recruit several female members. Those who are interested in singing are welcome to visit the society for an interview. The address of the society is No. 14 Da Da Lane, across from the Aivin羲 Road Patrol Room, telephone number 32045.</p>
<p>The International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, in view of the lack of statistics on domestic radio owners, hereby reiterates the order that a radio registration application form must be completed and submitted for registration before the end of August. The Shanghai Radio Research Society at No. 390 Nanjing Road (at the mouth of Wufu Lane) has specially obtained many copies of the registration application form from the International Telecommunications Bureau for all sectors to request registration and guide all registration procedures, specifically to serve those who have radios, and does not charge any fees. It is also heard that the society's repair department has gathered many specialized personnel to be responsible for repairing damaged radios, with low fees and fast delivery. Business has been very busy recently.</p>

<h3 id="e209">Jin Cheng Premieres "Grace of a Beauty" <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The new production "Grace of a Beauty" by Tianyi Film Company is directed by Wen Yimin, starring Lu Lixia, Li Ying, Wei Pengfei, Shen Yarlun, Zhang Zhenduo, etc. This film is based on the novel "Grace of a Beauty" by the famous novelist Zhang Henshui. The plot takes a singing and dancing troupe as the background, with joys and sorrows mixed, laughter and tears intertwined. Its depiction of urban love is especially penetrating. Famous singers Bai Hong, Liming Jian, Yan Fei, Zhou Xuan, Xu Jian, etc. have also joined in the show, making it even more splendid. The film is scheduled to be premiered at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater, which is filled with the fragrance of coldness, on the 27th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Dancing Stars and Singers in "Peach Blossom Dream" <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>

<h3 id="e211">Cathay Premieres "Symphony of Two Hearts" <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>The long-rumored "Symphony of Two Hearts" Two Hearts in Walt Time has been scheduled to be premiered at the Cathay Grand Theater on Avenue Joffre today (Saturday). The film stars Carl Brisson, who leaped from a singing star to a movie star. Although he has only starred in three films, "The Ring", "The Private Life of the Emperor", and this "Symphony of Two Hearts," his suave attitude has long been deeply imprinted in the minds of thousands of movie fans. "Symphony of Two Hearts" takes love as the warp and singing and dancing as the weft. The background is beautiful, the scenes are grand, and the description of how men pursue women and how women deal with men is particularly profound. When this film was produced, the film company specially invited Francesca, a red singer famous in Europe and America for her singing and dancing skills, to play the heroine in the film, so both the singing and the dancing are original and completely different from ordinary singing and dancing films. The picture below is a scene from the film.</p>
<h3 id="e212">Sun Shiyi's Dirge for Nie Er <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>The young composer Nie Er drowned in the sea off Kugenuma Beach in Fujisawa Town, Kanagawa Prefecture, Japan, on the night of the 17th of this month. His body is missing. His memorial service is currently being prepared and launched in Shanghai. His close friend Sun Shiyi, with unlimited sorrow, wrote a dirge, which has been set to music by Lü Ji. It will be printed and distributed soon. Here is the original version of Sun's dirge:</p>
<p>Dirge for Nie Er Sun Shiyi</p>
<p>The wind is calling,</p>
<p>The sea is roaring,</p>
<p>The waves are beckoning;</p>
<p>When the night is deep,</p>
<p>The moon is shining in the long sky,</p>
<p>Young friend—he,</p>
<p>Threw himself into the embrace of the ocean;</p>
<p>Swallowed in the raging waves and high tide</p>
<p>How could I have imagined?</p>
<p>From now on, farewell forever!</p>
<p>From now on, we have been deprived of our ambitious hero;</p>
<p>From now on, we are missing you at our outpost.</p>
<p>From now on, drifting where, far away from the homeland!</p>
<p>From now on, longing for people thousands of miles away, only dreams are distant!</p>
<p>Great ambitions are thrown away,</p>
<p>Heart and soul are not in vain.</p>
<p>Listen to thousands of people singing the heroic songs you composed,</p>
<p>You should be smiling in the underworld.</p>
<p>Facing the shocking bad news,</p>
<p>Looking at the boundless waves,</p>
<p>Do you know that your friends in your homeland, today,</p>
<p>With broken hearts, are mourning you!</p>
