<p>墨西哥京城　鑛業金融雜誌、鑒於近日銀價繼續跌落、深恐長此以往、對於墨西哥銀鑛工業、發生不利影響、爰向熟悉銀鑛業者、探詢究竟、據稱、本國銀鑛業所開採之鑛砂、如其每噸所含純銀、平均在五五零格蘭姆以上、則銀價縱較每盎斯美元六角零二五之行市、再跌去數分、當猶可勉强支持、但若銀價一蹶不振、繼續跌落、則該業惟有兩途可循、一卽僅限於開採含銀成分較高之鑛砂、以增加收入、一卽設法减低工資運費捐稅等、以减輕成本、捨此二法、該業卽無以支撐因銀價傾跌所致之危局也、至以墨國產銀數量而論、按經濟部十月份公報所載、年來銀價雖已高漲、（按銀價直至最近美國停止在倫敦購銀之後　始乃跌落、在此以前則以美國推行購銀政策之故、始終趨漲、）但該國產銀總額、較之往年、無甚出入、例如去年一月份產額為一九四·〇〇〇公斤、同年十月份則為二一二·〇〇〇公斤、相差之數幷不甚鉅、可見銀價上漲、未足以增高產銀總額、唯若干處含銀成分較低之鑛山、前經棄置不開者、今以有利可圖、多已重行開採、其成分較高之鑛苗、則無不加以節制、務使地力不竭、留待將來採用　斯為銀價上漲之影響、抑自銀價上漲以來、政府曾對銀鑛業者徵收盈餘稅、最近各鑛主以此項稅率過高、商民不勝負担、曾向政府提出節略、聲請减輕、但此項稅收為數不貲、大有裨于國家財政、又况銀價上漲之後　國內一般經濟、皆有起色、政府各種財政收入、自亦隨之增加、此其結果、遂使預算情形、大為改善、例如一九三二年度預算、共虧短二八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇貝索斯、（墨西哥幣名（迨一九三四年度預算　則收支相抵、反而凈餘四〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇貝索斯、此皆受銀價高漲之賜、政府得此鉅欵挹注之後、乃得在公用事業方而、多所建樹、最近且由國會通過、將全國公務人員三萬八千名之薪資、凡　月薪在二百貝索斯以下者、一律增加百分之五、將來聞尚有繼續加薪之望、由是觀之、銀價若果逐步跌落、其影響所及、不僅墨國一般　濟將受嚴重打擊、卽國家預算、亦將·　之動搖、關於此　、著名經濟學家瑪萊洛斯柴拉哥薩會發表一文、共言曰、「自美國成為銀貨唯一買主以還、白銀一物、已不復為工業用　鑄幣用之一種商品、顧反蛻變而為具有强迫力量之武器、凡多少以產銀事業維持國家經濟平衡之國家、尤其如墨西哥國、隨時可受此種武器之扼制、結果自必迫令吾人直接成為此北方鄰邦（指美國而言）之附庸而已」云云、（二十八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>國語科講演　寫作什麼（續）</h3>
<p>— 開明書店編輯葉紹鈞</p>
<p>以上說了許多的話，無非說明寫作材料應該以自己的經騐爲範圍。諸位現在動手寫作的幾個方面原都不出這個範圍，只要所抱的態度合乎正常，動一回筆自然得到一回的實益，我想諸位或者要問：「敎師命題作文，恐怕不屬於我們的經騐範圍以內吧」？我可以這樣回答，凡是賢明的國文敎師，他所出的題目决不會超出了學生的經騐範圍。他出題目的時候，完全放棄了自己的主觀見解，只是站在學生的立脚點上來代替學生設想，什麼材料是學生所有的經騐，是學生所能寫的，要寫的，選擇定了，他才寫出他的題目來。這樣，題目雖然由敎師出，在學生方面，郤同寫一封信作一篇游記一樣，仍然是爲着發表自己的經騐而寫作。同時又得到了練習的益處。我知道現在的國文敎師賢明的很多，他們根據實際的經騐和平時的研究，斷不肯出一些離奇的題目，離開了學生的經騐十萬八千里，敎學生搔頭摸耳，歎息說：沒有意思，沒有材料的。自然，也難免有一些敎師受習慣和環境的限制，所出題目不很適合學生的胃口，如我所見過的「學而時習之論」就是一個例子。我若是學生，就不明白這個題目應該怎樣地論學而時習之，照常識講，大概是不錯的，那末除了說這個話不錯以外，還有什麼可設呢？這種題目，從前書塾裹是常出的，現在升學考試和會考也間或有類似的題目，那位敎師出這個題目，大概就由於這兩種影響。諸位如果遇見了那樣的敎師，只得誠誠懇懇地請求他，說現在學會作怎樣題目，只有逢到會考也許有點用處，在實生活中，簡直沒有需要作這樣題目的時候。即使您先生認爲預備會老的偶爾有用也屬必要，可否讓我們少作幾回這樣題目，多作幾回發表自己的經騐的文字。這樣的話很有道理，並不是什麼非分的請求。話語只要有道理，誰不願意聽？我想諸位的敎師一定會依從你們的。</p>
<p>再說經騐有深切淺薄和準確錯誤的不同。譬如我們走過一條街道，約略知道這條街道上有二三十家店舖，這不能不算是經騐。但是我們如果仔細觀察，知道這二三十家店舖屬於那一些部門，那一家的資本最雄厚，那一家的營業最發達，這樣的經騐就比前面的經騐深切得多了。又譬如我們在小時候看見月食，老祖母就告訴我們，這是野月亮要把家月亮呑到肚皮裹去，若不敲鑼打鼓來救，家月亮眞個要被吃掉的：我們聽了記在心裏，這就是我們的經騐，然而是錯誤的，後來我們學了地理，懂得星球運行的大概，才知道並沒有什麼野月亮，更沒有呑食家月亮這回事，那遮沒了月亮的原來是地球的影子。這才是一種準確的經騐，前面說的不過是兩個例子，此外可以依此類推：我們拿起來寫作，正同我們開口說話一樣，總希望寫出一些深切的準確的經騐，不願意塗滿一張紙頭全是一些淺薄的錯誤的經騐，不然寫下來的不是無聊的話，就是瞎說的話，這就把寫作的事看得太不嚴正，和我們所抱的態度違背了。這樣說起來，單是寫出我們自己的經騐還嫌不够，須要更進一步，給經騐加上一番洗煉，才可以下筆絕不隨使，合乎我們的寫作態度</p>
<p>給經騐加上一番洗煉，這就不是寫作方面的事了，而且也不只是國文科和各學科方面的事，却是我們整個生活裏的事，我們每天上課，每天看書，每天勞作，每天游戲，隨時隨地在那裏把經騐弄得深切修到準確。這並不是爲着要作文才這樣做，我們要做一個有用的人，要做一個健全的公民，就不得不這樣做。可是同時也就給寫作開了個活活的泉源，從這個泉源裏去汲取，總可以得到澄淸的水。所怕的是上課不肯好好地用功，看書沒有選擇又沒有方法，勞作和游戲也只是隨隨便便，馬馬虎虎，不用全副精神對付，只圖敷衍過去就算，這樣，經騐就很難達到深切和準確的境界，這樣的人去做任何事悄都難弄得好，當然不能稱爲有用，當然彀不上呌做健全的公民。同時他的寫作的泉源是乾涸了，勉强要去汲取，汲起來的也只是一盞半盞混着泥的髒水。所以，寫作材料的來源普遍於整個生活裏，整個生活時時刻刻在那裹向上發展，寫作材料自會滔滔汨汨，無窮盡地，流注出來，而且常是澄淸的，有些人不明白這個道理，以爲寫作只是伏在桌子上拿起筆來硬幹就會進步的事，他們不顧到自己的經騐的洗煉，他們沒有想到寫作和自己的經騐原是糾結而不可分的。這樣硬幹的結果，也許因爲技術的熟練，會寫成一些海市蜃樓那樣很像樣很好的文字。但這只是一種毫無實用的玩意兒，在實生活裏好比贅瘤，所以這種熟練的技術也是毫無實用的技術。我希望諸位不要犯這些人的毛病，須記着寫作材料的來源普過於整個的生活，寫作的時候固然要伏在桌子上，但是洗練寫作材料不能够單單伏在桌子上，離開了寫作的桌子，在上課看書勞作游戲的時候，刻刻認眞，處處努力，一方面做人本來應該這麼做，另一方面也就是開鑿了寫作材料的泉源。這並不是什麼艱難的事，一個合格的中等學生就能够這麼做。我希望諸位個個是合格的中等學生。</p>
<p>現在來一個結束。寫作什麼呢？要寫出我們自己的經騐。自己的經騐又必須深切，必須準確，這要整個生活裏去下工夫，才可以如願以償。有了深切的準確的經騐，就不愁沒有很好的材料寫成很好的文字。（完）</p>

<h3>農村生活嚴淡</h3>
<p>— 俞慶棠主編</p>
<p>中國黃土平原的農村婦女印象　　張錫昌</p>
<p>中國的黃土平原，包括山東·河北·山西的全部，江蘇和安徵的北部，河南的中部和北部。這個廣大的區域，因為農業生產的落後，農民的意識跟着也就　殘存著封建的遺跡。這種意識反映在　　婦女生活上，便表現為被「舊禮教一東縛得緊緊，婦女幾乎處於「家庭的奴隸」的地位，不見世面，沒有獨立的人格，沒有社會的地位。在生產落後的黃土平原，整個貧苦農民階層都在過着「非人的」生活，特別是在最近加緊殖民地化過程中的地帶。最倒霉的自然是這廣大的農民層；而罩上「封建面紗」的農村婦女，其生活將更形慘淡了。</p>
<p>最近幾年，因為有好幾次的機會，在河北，山東，河南，蘇北，皖北等處的農村中旅行，對於這區域的農村婦女生活，得到一些印象，也祇能說是印象。我想寫出來，作為關心中國婦女問題者之參考。因為所寫的是「印象」就不免與實際情形有程度上的差異，但一般說來，是與「實際」距離不遠的。</p>
<p>一個笑話　　這一帶的農村婦女，最怕見人，尤其是怕見陌生的人。平常守在家裹，不輕易出門。有時坐在門前，看見生人走過，便馬上面向屋內，或竟向裹面跑去。所以你在農村中跑，不大會看見中年婦女。</p>
<p>有一次，一位北方朋友吿訴我一個笑話。一天，有一個農民跑到某一個農家去，那農家的丈夫到田裹「幹活」去了，只有他的妻子在家裏守着。那位農夫在外面敲着門，說：「有人在家嗎？」「沒有人在家！」裏面女人的聲音這樣回答。她也不出去開門。其實在她們看來，農村中婦女不當自己是一個堂堂的人，這已經不是一個笑話了。</p>
<p>小學裏找不到女學生　　在中國農村中，上學的孩子根本就不多。現在的教育，固然為少數有錢人所享有，沒有錢的大批兒童，都被拒在學校的門外。而少數有福享受「教育權」的孩子，又大多數是男孩子。卽就全國而論，據教育部最近發表的統計，受過小學教育的兒童，男生佔有百分之八四·九，女生只佔百分之一五·一。跟着生產落後而文化也落後的黃土平原，在農村中的小學裹很不易見到女學生。我們因為調查農村經濟的關係，常常住在村子裹，小學校是我們最好的住所。一個三四百家人家的大村莊，由於全體村民的負担，開設了一個小學校，上學的却只有寥寥繼個人。我們很少看到有女學生，便間他們：「為什麼不把女孩子送到學校裏去？」「女孩子要上學嗎？我們連男孩子還在家裹呢！」這是他們理由十分充足的回答。</p>
<p>「查放足的來了！」</p>
<p>七八年前，南方婦女的剪髮是成問題的。現在無論你到窮鄉僻壤，你很難找到拖辮子的女孩了。這不能不說是一種進步。（雖然是表面的）可是在山東，河北，河南等省農村中，她們的問題還不是剪髮，而是「纏足」的問題。不但中年的婦女，甚至五六歲七八歲的女小孩，還都把她們的「天足」緊緊地束縛住。有一次在河南北部輝縣的農村裏調查，我們幾個人跑到某一個村莊上去的時候，許多人都嚷着說：「查放足的來了！查放足的來了！」嚇得許多女小孩都跑得乾乾凈淨。</p>
<p>原來區公所鄉公所把「放足」列入主要施政工作之一。在街鎭和大村莊上，張貼着禁止纏足的皇皇佈吿。有許多區長和鄉長的太太，她們「以身作則」，自己先放起足來。在河南許昌，襄縣等處，縣政府　有放足委員會的組織，縣長的太太是當然委員。所有三十歲以下的婦女，一律須受檢查。不放足者，處以一元的罰金。這次看見我們許多人下鄉，自然要嚇得「魂不附禮」了！</p>
<p>有許多農村婦女，她們死也不肯放足；因為放了足就嫁不到丈夫。所以情願繳一塊錢的「纏足捐」（這名詞並不是作者杜撰的），而不情願放足。但這樣一來，農民又多了一層負担！</p>
<p>「是姊姊還是母親？」</p>
<p>在北方，很難跑到農民家裹去的；就是進去了，也不輕易看見他們的主婦。有一次，我們走進一個比較開通的靑年農夫家裏，看見一個年齡比他大許多的婦女，我們便問一她是你姊姊還是你母親？」這位靑年農夫被我們問得「面紅耳赤」，羞答答地笑起來了。她原來是他的妻子。</p>
<p>男子結婚一般的早，而妻子的年齡，一般的比丈夫來得大。男子普通十三四歲結婚，女子二十左右出嫁，女子往往比男子大五六歲。有時，男孩子的年齡實在太小了，妻子簡直還要兼擔母親的任務。我們在山東濰縣調查的時候也聽到一個笑話。某村農家的孩子祇有九歲，那年居然也結了婚。某一個夏天的晚上，家人都在天井裹乘凉，那九歲的新郎睡着在一張躺椅裹。其他的人和新娘開玩笑，大家躲開，新娘沒法，只得抱着「他」到自己房裹去；那　，躲　的人自然在暗笑了！</p>
<p>北方人不說「娶妻」而說「娶媳婦兒」，好像是為父母娶了一個「兒媳」而不是為自己娶一個「妻子」。　　的確如此。在父母的意思，早早為兒子娶了個「媳婦兒」，不但可以了却一樁心事，從此家裹許多雜事也有人代勞。不過還得要有一個前提，就是手頭有錢。近幾年來，農村經濟急劇崩潰的結果，中年的農夫無錢「娶媳婦兒」的，也在天天增加啊！</p>
<p>女學生的一個難題</p>
<p>河北山東以及河南北部等地，受過中等教育的女學生，眞是「鳳毛麟角」。她們的家屬，不是農村中收租放債的地主，便是有勢有威的豪紳。他們的「小姐」，既然送進中等學校去讀書，自然多半不會輕易「許」人的。去年我們住在山東某處一座男女同學的師範學校裹，據幾個男學生吿訴我們說，北方各學校裹的女學生，都有一個難題。因為所有男同學差不多早就結了婚，所以她們的婚姻問題，往往很難解次。因為師範畢業的女學生找不到男學生做伴侶，往往隨便家庭的意旨嫁給有財有勢的官僚政客，所以農村小學裏也就很難找到一個女先生，農村婦女的教育問題，自然就無人間訊了。</p>
<p>一件特別嫁裝</p>
<p>前年夏天，我們在河南內鄉。一天晚上，我們和各區區長閒談，（因為第二天有一個區長會議，所以他們事前已到了城裹）談起了河南人重男輕女的風尚，談起了女子出嫁的習慣。據說，在唐河，鄧縣，南召一帶十匪出沒無常的區域，嫁女時往往除掉「賠田」外，還要「賠槍」（盒子砲及快槍都有）。在這一帶，溺女的風氣很盛，因為賠不起的人家，只得早些犧牲女兒。我們從來沒有聽說有還樣「特別的嫁裝，當時我們不信。後來在別處又聽得同樣的傳說，我想　實一定不會沒有了。</p>
<p>完全和農業生產脫離</p>
<p>黃十平原的農村婦女，所以受到這樣種種不平等的殘酷的待遇，我想最某本的原因是幾千年來她們完全和農業生產脫　的結果。你不看見廣東廣西的農村婦女嗎？她們能插秧，她們能肩挑，她們能搖船，她們能比男子做更多的勞動。在南方，當農忙的時候，你可以在市集上看見成羣的農婦「擺行」（卽待　女工排列街頭之謂）的情形，　可以看見農田裹婦女一面插秧一面唱歌的情形。可是你走到一片黃土的北方去，除掉少數貧困的農婦小得已在田間做些輕便的工作外，你就萬萬找不到一個赤足短褲拿了笨重的農具在田間工作的婦女。因為她們脫離了農　勞動，脫離了農業生產，幾千年來就沒有做一個「堂堂的人」，永遠做家庭的「　庸」，做男子的「奴隸」無怪山西閣錫山先生在他最近提議而尚未見諸賓行的「土地村公有」辦法中，分配「份地」的時候，沒　婦女的「分」了！</p>

<p>新聲社云、各銀行下半年度結賬、儲蓄部於十五日起、商業部於二十日起、開始結息後、同時視各銀行賬務對內延長辦公時間、昨日雖為星期例假、各銀行仍有對內照常辦公者、連日因在銀行總賬期內、收解紛繁、例如銀行票擴交換所交換總額、前日為二千二百五十五萬六千二百十元八角一分、新年各銀行一律休假三天</p>
<p>商業銀行盈餘較少</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向銀行界探悉、各銀行在此百業凋敝之際、一切放欵、早已特別謹愼、况銀行放欵、素以抵押為主、故呆賬甚少、尚能獲盈利、預料中央銀行、贏餘最大、中國交通等行次之、惟各商業銀行之盈利、較往年減少、</p>

<p>各莊放欵均已緊縮</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨向錢業界探悉、錢業放欵、素以信用為主、抵押次之、各莊雖均已緊縮、但本年度如華豐麵粉廠·錦興地產公司·泰豐罐頭餅干公司·華英藥房·老祥泰皮貨局·等之停閉、其所負之債、以錢莊長期放欵及往來透支甚多、因此有少數錢莊受累匪淺、不得已改組、所以錢莊今年之盈利報吿、恐平平者甚多、</p>

<h3>在黔被擄兩敎士　述在匪區生活</h3>
<p>日日社云、前在貴州東北、湖南西北境、被赤匪擄去、之紐西蘭內地會派遺來華、之宣敎士海曼M　r．A．Haymran、已於上月十八日由匪釋放、惟海氏因病關係、昨日始能自述其在匪區經過情形、海氏被匪擄去、計共四百零十三日、至於與海氏同被擄去之鮑斯哈安得特　Mr．R．Bosshardt氏、理在何處、尚不明晰、緣赤匪已由舊日藏匿二人之住處、向南移動、據聞鮑氏現在湖南西部溆浦縣境、情形尚好、現正設法脫難、海氏得以被釋者、實因匪徒意其必死故也、海氏被釋後臥病數週、體亦極弱、曾在長沙及此間醫院將養多日、近始恢復健康、海氏擬在此間與其家屬過冬後、再行離滬</p>
<p>海氏被匪　擄去經過</p>
<p>去年（民二十三）十月二日、赤匪蕭克侵入貴陽東八十英哩地方時、海氏與鮑氏夫婦及渠等家屬均被蕭匪擄去、當時赤匪係由貴州東南小路向東北移動、中央軍正沿大路開　、事先僅知左近多有苗匪踪跡、故敎會方面均未避退、赤匪在黔僅停一日卽棄留海鮑兩夫人等、恊同海鮑兩氏及愛姆比蘭Miss　Emblen三人等逃竄、惟愛小姐於數日後卽行釋放、嗣後海鮑與匪東竄西逃、約經廿六七日、直至蕭克與賀龍合股後始比較以先安定、惟偊爾仍在湖南西北部不時變更地方、</p>
<p>赤匪待遇　外人尚優</p>
<p>赤匪待遇被擄之外國人士、尚稱優厚、所予食物、與赤匪所食者相同、（米辣椒等）、至對被擄之中國人、則備極虐待、每日僅予以鍋渣少許、若遇中央軍飛機來轟炸時、赤匪卽將彼二人藏匿於避彈洞穴附近、至於被擄之中國人、則一律加以手拷或加以捆綁、置於露天處所、據海氏稱、赤匪最恨英國、因渠等認英國為帝國主義者中之最兇惡者、并認紐西蘭為英之殖民地、與赤匪同為帝國主義者之犧牲品、故對彼尚好、但渠等殊不知鮑氏為瑞士籍、不過生於英曼遮斯德、學於倫敦聖經學校而已、故渠等多認其為帝國主義者之偵探、監視亦較為嚴厲、</p>
<p>赤匪軍營　生活一斑</p>
<p>赤匪對海鮑兩氏、俱疑為帝國主義者之偵探、故時時分別訊問、并將其在黔所擾敎堂、敎徒等照片、時時加以仔細之考察、因海鮑原在之敎會中、存有照像用具甚夥、故對之甚為疑惑、據海氏稱、此種照像、係另外兩敎會寄存者、關於赤匪軍營生活、海氏所述甚少、惟海氏允許他日有機、或將赤匪之偵探術、略述一二、繼謂、赤匪終日忙碌、無片刻間暇、每赤匪居住之處、多闢有聚會處所、墻壁上均懸有列寗及馬克斯照片、赤匪又時常開會、會中每人均須演說、成互述從匪經過、</p>
<p>海鮑兩氏　匪窟生活</p>
<p>海鮑兩氏在匪窟中、寢食均在一處、自備之用具亦均允其携帶、惟聖經一類書籍、均行沒收、據海氏稱、彼曾以其所有之印花布、為一赤匪做成褲子兩條、又謂、赤匪所戴之帽為一尖形之小帽、如賽馬者所御之帽、上綴以五角星形符號、海鮑兩氏曾被匪懲罰一次、計在一黑屋子中、禁閉五週、至受懲罰原因、迄今不明、每日無事、海鮑兩氏、則以互相答問聖經上之句子或歌唱讚美詩、藉以消磨時光、</p>
<p>圖逃未得　變成敎師</p>
<p>去冬、海鮑兩氏曾一度潛逃、但不幸復被攫回、并送交赤匪法庭判罪、赤匪法庭、頗有一述價値、法官為赤匪領袖、高坐於一台上、犯人亦立於台上、臺下為羣眾、判决結果、當眾宣佈、并允羣眾自由發言、審訊海鮑兩氏時、開庭甚久、并曾延長多時、故羣眾多因疲倦散去、赤匪法官訊問羣眾意見時、中有一人喊稱「處以死刑、」有人喊稱「打屁股一、最後、法官主張科以罰金、判决後卽將彼兩人拘禁、與渠等一同拘禁者、尚有一赤匪、惟此匪最後因令其自行補綴襪子、得以獲釋、但因此致令鮑氏憶及彼之針織技術、彼曾以箸削成一鈎針、并以此針織成一雙套鞋、不意此事竟得赤匪讚賞、此後時時送來毛綫令其織綴、更不時將破舊之毛綫衫等送來、令其重行織綴、海氏則多作拆綫工作、鮑氏則忙於織綴工作、據海氏稱、此時彼之身體、日形衰弱、手臂亦感不靈、赤匪特允其飲食用匙、并與以鷄卵、最初赤匪均喊彼二人為「洋狗」、或「帝國主義者們走狗」、在海氏被釋前、則已呼彼兩二人為「洋先生」矣、</p>

<h3>小男兒　（一）（三）（九）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>第十八章　眞好朋友</p>
<p>大風波已經過去，一片和平又復降臨到梅莊，並且繼續不斷至數星期之久，因為大的童子覺得南恩和羅勃的迷失，咎實在於他們，因此他們竟如嚴父一般看管他們，使得別人也覺得他們太麻煩了；至於小的呢，聽到南恩叙述她的險遇不知多少次數，因此他們視迷失為人間莫大的慘禍，從此不敢探首出大門以外，否則黑夜便欲忽然來臨，鬼一般的黑牛會從黑暗中朦朧出現的。</p>
<p>「這是太好了，恐怕不能經久罷，」蜀夫人說道：因為多年從事於兒童的養育的，知道這麽的沉靜常常埋伏着大紛擾的種子。</p>
<p>裴夫人確是對的；和平祗是暫時的靜歇，風暴正在醞釀中，所以不到一月，一種道德上的天崩地坼，竟震撼着整個的梅莊。</p>
<p>韜摩的幾個母鷄，可說是這次大禍的本原所在，因為假如她們不繼續生這麽多的蛋，他是不會以它們作買賣，購得這麽多的錢。金錢是萬惡的根，然而這却又是一種有用的根，我們非此不能生存，正如我們非有番薯不能生存是一樣的。無論如何，韜摩是非此不可的，因為他揮金如土，因此裴先不得不强迫他將錢存在儲蓄庫裏，而且送給他一個人自用的——一所巍錫製的建築物，門上鐫着一個名字，頂上有一個高高的烟囱，銅元從這裏下去，於是便在那裏麥克麥克響着，直到裴先生許他在底邊開個旁門，才可放它們出來。</p>

<h3>一年來之上海金融</h3>
<p>— 魏友棐</p>
<p>一　全年金融概况</p>
<p>二十四年這一年，可以說中國空前未有的恐慌年。外形的原因，是美國的購銀，從二十三年度繼續下來，雖有平衡稅的壓制，仍不能不阻當白銀出口的趨勢，因現底的缺乏，形成金融收縮，信用停滯的狀態，工商業更顯出棻敝了素握全國令融權威的上海遂呈露擾亂的局面。最明顯的是金融機關的停業，繼之通國金融恐慌的漸動，重要工商業者的歇業，</p>
<p>列强的在華勢力，因國際形勢的演變，也互有消長。但國內的弱小工商業，却因各資本主義國家的侵蝕，破壞無餘，同時，復有經常性的水災，二漫全國。本已百孔千瘡的農村，其生路愈形絕望。綜計一月至六月半年中，洋米的進口，估全國總輸入的第一位。則即無水災，農民的生計被掠奪，已可見一斑。</p>
<p>在這種內外交迫的經濟恐慌中，金融狀態之緊迫，雖因各方面的救濟，稍蘇喘息。而十月下旬，到十月底，十日之內，金價突因投機者的猛抬，由九百元而漲到一千二百元。並因金價的暴騰，又影響到匯價，國內連年極度萎縮的物價，忽又有警人的漲起，市塲呈極紊亂的狀態，於是遂有政府改革幣制安定外滙的計劃。</p>
<p>現在想把全年的金融情形約略叙述如下。</p>
<p>我國改用陽曆已久，而商業界則仍保守着險曆。其重要的金融季節，仍以陰曆的三，六，九月三期，及端午，中秋，年關三節為主，因此凡是發生風潮的季節，差不多仍以上述的習慣做經緯。本文為便於叙述計，仍照陽曆的分野。</p>
<p>在一月到三月的第一季中，一月份還是舊曆二十三年的範圍中，因結帳期近，內地的現銀運集上海，存底較爲豐厚，拆息也低下，但票據收解數却要比上年本月减少一萬萬元，足見金融萎疲的情形，到　月初旬的大結束期，上海錢莊因放欵不能收回而宣吿停業者，計八家之多。結帳期後，雖以白銀的出口，而存底薄弱，但拆息仍極形萎疲，可見工商業發動的情形，已大非昔比。同時，金融界也各自保持現金以防萬一，工商界毫不得實惠，全國有名的申新七廠，就於此時發生被拍賣糾紛。</p>
<p>四月到六月的一季，是最緊張的一季。因爲這時期包括錢業的四底放欵到期，端午節，銀行决算的日期。在四底期，因放欵不能到期收回，又發生周轉不靈而淸理的金融機關。五月中本是絲茶麥上市，金融季節最吒盛時期，近年却因絲茶價格慘落，存貨壅積，不能推動。麥市也因爲洋米的進口，沒有出路，反抓增了入超數字。所以市塲成爲有行市情形。交到了六月，銀錢業對於交易，都保持非常謹愼，市塲表面十分淸靜，而暗中却十分緊張。所以一到六月底，因銀行的結帳，現底雖不减少，運用的籌碼却大起恐慌，因此拆息漲到一角九分，劃頭漲到七角以上，無怪乎各銀錢業倒閉疊出，而全國靑島，漢口，北平，厦門，廣州……等處都要此起彼應了。</p>
<p>這時發生各大工廠的停業消息，水災也開始發動，同時沙遜爵士乘機發表鎊券計劃，誘致中國加入英鎊集團。</p>
<p>七八九月的第三季，經過一决重大風潮，又因政府方面公布救濟市面辦法，白銀的進口，銀根稍爲鬆動。但仍打不破沉悶的局面。復因內地金融恐慌深刻化的關係，各內地滙兌銀行，都發生周轉不靈情形。</p>
<p>第四季的十月，繼安靜第三季之後，因意阿戰事的暴發，國內產業如絲，桐油等類，因刺激而鬆動，市面也稍顯活潑。一到了十月中旬，因爲美國的白銀政策沒有新的發展，又因爲中央銀行購買標金，以及市塲對於通貨膨脹關係，標金突然飛漲，外匯空前縮緊，金價的最高額曾到一千二百十七元高峯。到十★月初，我國的對外滙市，旣縮到百分之二十左右，於是紗，紛，桐油，絲茶，都一致高漲，財部當局鑒於外　高下不一，對於國民經濟上的影響，因此於十一月四日毅然宣布改革幣制，將白銀收爲國有，以中央，中國，交通，三銀行的紙幣爲無限法幣，並且由三行無限制買賣外滙，以安定滙價。</p>
<p>從十一月到十二月，市面因法幣的流通，籌碼已感鬆動，十底的結帳期，也因財部通令展期而勉波。中央銀行揭示的外滙行市，到十二月下旬，仍保持十一月四日的平價，已未有從前突上突下的弊了。</p>
<p>籌碼缺乏的病，已相常解除。而因匯價穩，定一般人對于法幣的疑慮，物價隨趨於漲上。但基於購買力薄弱關係，國內產業仍沒有生氣。到了十二月中旬，美國因爲中國幣制的改革，脫離了白銀政策的覊伴，因即停購白銀，銀價父趨回跌，金價日趨高翔，又回恢到十一月初的擾攘形態，金融的恐慌性還沒有轉機，而例强的貨幣權的掠奪，已在短兵相接的時期了。工商業在統年中，沒有抬頭，因此金融業對於營業上的欵項失去周轉的功能，預計在本年的結束期，一定有許多如着太沉悶血無意營業的，這因由於銀錢業本身的不健會又何嘗不是工商業的厄運呢？</p>
<p>下面是全年的拆息平均情形：（單位分）</p>
<p>二　銀業錢的興替</p>
<p>二十三年是全國銀行最活躍的一年，新設的銀行凡二十家，創十年來的最高紀錄。而這個二十家的數字中，上海的一部佔五分之三。其中由內地分設到上海來的，允屬多數，上海成爲銀行的集中區了。</p>
<p>銀行業所以特殊發皇的原因，由於近年來農村的衰落，都市擁集着資金，又因爲投機事業的發達，不覺忽略了余融業扶植工商業者的正規途徑，在銀行最發皇的時候，早有人指出，認爲這是一種畸形現象，而必出之於崩潰之途，這預測在二十四年的一年中，不幸見之實現。自從上海感覺現銀出口的恐慌以後，佔有上海金融籌碼極大數字（照一九三〇年的估價是二十萬萬）的地契，驟然失其運用。一般擁有大量地產的銀錢業，因着地產交易的呆滯，地値的减低，無形中造成周轉不靈，財產减値的形態，到二十四年的上半委就各顯出窘態來，乃不得不趨於倒閉或停業之一途。當然，因工商業的衰落，而使到期的欵項不能收回，因而感覺吉轉不靈者也是重要的一個原因。</p>
<p>全社會的通貨緊縮，復發生了擠提情形。當金融業者在開拓業務常兒，對於搜集零星存欵，都是不遺餘力，以便從事於大最的投機，增殖其利潤，不幸在這一時期，已搜集的存欵，或者變爲呆賬，或者變爲不動產，或者因運用失宜而侵蝕，遂致不能應付存戶的擠提。因一二家少數的停業，而影饗到全綫的崩潰。向之惟恐搜集存額不多的金融機關，這時又恐存額的太多，不易應付了。</p>
<p>一年來的上海銀錢業，綜計開辦商辦銀行三家，公辦銀行一家，停閉銀行十四家，錢莊八家，現在分寫在下面：　新設商辦銀行三家——國信銀行，永大銀行，建華銀行。</p>
<p>新設公辦銀行一家——浙江地方銀行。停閉銀行十四家——嘉華銀行，通易銀行，</p>
<p>明華銀行，美豐銀行，寗波實業銀行，江南銀行，厦門銀行，世界銀行，正大銀行，廣東銀行，香港國民銀行，信通銀行，大滬銀行，華業銀行。停閉錢莊八家——榮康莊，益康莊，寳大裕莊，德昶莊，寅泰莊，益昌莊，永興莊，同泰莊。</p>
<p>上述新設的銀行，最大的是資本額國幣一百萬元，最少是五十萬元。停閉的銀行，最大的是港幣一千一百萬元，國幣五百萬元，最少的是國幣一十萬元。</p>
<p>此外還有關於國家財政的銀行新設施，是中國交通兩行的增加官股，又將中央，中國，交通三行合併力量，以便統制。在金融最恐慌的第三李中，還將四明，中國實業，中國通商三發行鈔券銀行改組，增　實力，恊助國家銀行的建設。</p>
<p>在四月到六月的一季中，各行的擠提，造成資本逃避的恐慌，中國銀行並於其時奉命開辦儲蓄部，收受儲蓄。在十月中，中央信託局成立，辦理各種的信託業務，金融上的力量，已歸入於一統了。</p>
<p>所以這一年就銀錢業的本身上說，雖是極暗淡的年份，而就政府統制金融的力量上來說，可以說是成功的。</p>
<p>三　業務上的演變</p>
<p>在業務方面，可以從存欵，放欵，兩方面得一槪略的觀念。</p>
<p>下面的數字，因爲錢莊無數字可依，所以都是銀行的統計。其二十三年底的數字，是推定額，二十叫年的數字，則是僅乎六月底的情形。</p>
<p>近年各行的存欵是逐漸增加的，其原由一種是銀行的發達，將游資集中；一種是各種舊式金融組織的沒落，遂集中於銀行。下面是十五年來的存欵數字：（單位元）</p>
<p>上面的數字，就廿三年到二十四年，計其增加額實在很少，如果除去了息，則所增加利的不過三百萬元。其一十四年的數字須特別注意者，則其時適在上海金融恐慌，中國銀行開辦儲蓄的時候，所以有許多是一種信用的移轉。若除去中國銀行的儲蓄存欵九百萬元，則反有减少的趨勢。</p>
<p>各銀行的資金的運用方面，可以舉抵押放欵及有價證券的購置爲例：</p>
<p>這兩項數字也是增加的。兩項數字在營業總額的地位，則用於抵押放欵者，以佔營業總額百分之六〇為最高，百分之一二為最低。用於購買有價證券者，以百分之六四爲最高，百分之十六爲最低。</p>
<p>放欵數字的增加，是吾於工商界有利，固然無從分析，但就銀行的本身而論，則其對於資金的運用，已漸向正規而發展，是差强人意的事。</p>
<p>就他方面觀，則工商業的恐慌情形，日益深刻化，下面是二十三年一月至六月與二十四年同期的統計：</p>
<p>我們若以金融業樞紐百業的原則而論則，一年來物價的低下，百業的衰敝，金融業存欵的减少，是無可疑的，是則放欵的增加，僅乎是科目的移轉而已，其內實未擴大。</p>
<p>在這一年中對於金融界的設施，有可以特別提出者三點：</p>
<p>銀錢業力量的集中　上海的金融，除去了洋商銀行不計，本來分成銀行與錢莊兩大集團，規模較小的銀行是隸屬於錢莊的。錢莊的票據交換所，（總會）跟銀行的票據交換所並不通氣。自二十四年六月金融風潮之後，銀錢業雙方感到非合一步驟；無以應付這嚴重的局面。因之由錢業聯合凖備庫，與銀行票據交換所恊議，凡錢莊向銀行收的票據，統留錢業聯合準備庫代收；銀行向錢莊收的票據，也統留票據交換所代表收取。其中計錢業方面的會員錢莊計五十五家，銀行的會昌銀行計三十七家。從此素來分野的銀錢業，開始合作起來。</p>
<p>政府對工商業的救濟　在二十四年四六季的金融風潮後，因為工商業的衰落，對於放欵都無法歸還，又因爲銀行結帳期近，感覺籌碼不足，因此工商業本身以及放欵給工商業的錢莊都需要救濟。政府在那時發表救濟錢業的辦法，同時成立工商業貸欵委員會辦理救濟事宜。秋季以後市面的安定，這舉動，是不能不認爲佔着事要的成分的。</p>
<p>中央銀行機能的發揮　中央銀行在這一個年度加大了他的力量，允其是三行合併以後。當秋後救濟工商業的時季，中央銀行承受了大量的押欵以及轉押。十一月政府管理通貨之後，統一了發行，中央銀行的權能又無形增大。中央銀行並有權無限制買賣外滙，從此中央銀行的外滙掛牌行市，父矯正素來由洋商掛牌的畸形狀態。同時，銀錢業贊同的承兌滙票，並由中央銀行承認轉貼現，於推行方面，顯然便利不少。他如中央信託局的成立，由國家力量來提倡儲蓄，當然比私家銀行好得多。</p>
<p>四　今後的展望</p>
<p>這一年金融黯淡的原因，我們仍不能不歸之於農工商業的萎縮，物價的下跌，失業的增加，政治的不安。種種原因。如此，富力的增加，旣屬困難的事，則要希望金融業力量的增大自然無從說起。</p>
<p>站在二十四年的盡頭，瞻望着前途。加甚中國余融恐慌的美國白銀政策，雖因着幣制改革而緩和，而美國對於這東方用銀國家的脫離了他的樊籠，正在時刻想表示他的威力，然則外來的貨幣勢力的脅迫是正在進展着。</p>
<p>剩餘商品的傾銷無法抵制，國內農村的破產，對於必需品之輸入不能减少，又沒有輸出品可以抵銷。桐油跟絲，在二十四年下半期雖有推進，但也曇花一現而已，於整個的工商界仍不能有所裨益，是則無論國內國外，其危難惰形是日在深刻着的。</p>
<p>上海把握了全國金融的重心，而近年全國的衰落，政治的不安定，反映出都市金融的萎疲。農村的人口，佔據了全國的大多數，我們要决定中國金融的前途，假定一切條件良好的話仍麒以農村狀態爲轉移的。吾則，連這一些閒散的金融，恐怕也不免歸納到摧枯拉朽中間去的呢。</p>
<h3>山東漁業之現狀及其改進（三續）</h3>
<p>— （丁逢白）</p>
<p>建設魚市塲。魚市塲爲魚介類集中我分配的樞紐，就是接受貨主這來的貨品的委託，一方以公正的卸賣，脫售於魚販，以便在當地消費。一方更就各需要地的消費狀况而施以適當的分配，務使其分配得宜，保持平衡狀態。因此魚市塲一方面須建築在大都市的消費塲所，更須有魚港的設備，予漁船以種種的便利；他方須聯絡交通機關，使所獲魚類能暢銷於各地以調節魚價。目前山束魚類的交易，都由魚行之魚販經手，凡漁民所捕獲之魚類，直接間接都是由魚行代售，魚行爲着了與同業競爭及本身營業繫榮計，不惜從漁民千辛萬苦中所獲來的魚物，削價競售，只圖拿得到佣金，漁民的生計如何，却無暇顧及了。所以魚行便形成了直接剝削漁民的機關。魚市塲的建設，能免除此種缺點：牠是用競賣的方法，以獲得公正的高價，而在魚市塲本身却只收很少數的佣金來維持牠的存在，這樣可使漁民從千辛萬苦中得來的生產物，能換到相當的代價。再魚市塲能設容量極大的冷藏庫，在魚類進口過多時，可以貯入其中，以節制魚市的降落，而使其價格經常得以保特牛衡。（註十四）</p>
<p>創辦水產學校。山東漁業之失敗，新式捕魚方法之未採用及製造方法之不良，也是其原因之一。水產學校之設立，在造成一批專鬥業漁的人才，將來可以由水產學校的專門人才來主持魚業，這樣，能利用新式的捕魚方法，使魚介類的產量增加，製造的方法改良，庶幾魚產品達到價廉而物美的地步，如是才能與外貨相傾銷。</p>
<p>成立漁業銀行。山東漁業，素即缺乏漁業金融之組織，所以大多數漁民之資本，均向魚行魚商處借貸而來，重利盤剝，尙屬餘事。弊端最大者，莫過於漁民因曾向某魚行借了資本，則其所有魚獲物一定要向該魚行代售，魚價之高下，遂任魚商之操縱支配，漁民反而無過問之權，這樣，獲利者爲魚商，漁民簡直等於牛馬。漁業銀行的設立，主要在於挹注漁民，實行微利的借貸，以减輕漁民的担負。同時漁民更有活動的資金以從事於漁業。</p>
<p>成立漁民合作社。漁民合作社之成立，完全是在相互的互助條件之下共謀漁民本身的利益。此合昨社的用途，完全是一個代表漁民利益的機關，所以應由漁民自己來主持，而不應當落入一般漁商之手。合作社在業務上應當形成漁民的指導和互助的機關；同時漁業銀行應與合作社取得密切之聯絡，如銀行耍放欽於漁民，頂好由合作社來支配，在漁民本身固然直接受益，在銀行方面亦可免很多麻煩。合作社更可直接向銀行借貸大批欵項，購置大批適合之漁船漁具，以供漁民之租用，而收以最低廉之租金。</p>
<p>加工製造的增設。增設水產品加工製造利益，一方可以調節魚價，他方叉可以推廣銷路。譬如某地水產品一旦生產過剩，就可以馬上將此水產品做成鹽乾品或罐頭等，以供不時之需，或者運到別地去銷售，這樣一來，該地就不會有貨物壅塞，魚價暴跌的敝病；同時也就是抵制舶來品傾銷的一個辦法。山東在幾個主要的漁業區域內若能設以幾個大規模的水產品製造廠，用科學化製造方法來製造，舶來品雖是價廉物美，但我以地理上的便利關係，終是能够戰勝牠的。（註十五）</p>
<p>改良運銷。在大規模的水產品製造廠設立之後，第二步就在改良運銷。因爲任以一種商品，必須推廣銷路，其目的不僅可以促進生產，調節余融，且能免除貨物壅塞一地，使物價趨於暴跌之弊。山東在運銷的便利上，無論水陸兩面，都比較發達，惟在運銷上須加何改良者，即冷藏火車及冷藏輪船之創設是也。此種創設，在於使水產品之運銷於遠地，頗為重要，尤其是如鮮魚一類的水產品之運送，更非冷藏沒備不可的。此外如漁業運輸公司之創設，在事實上也是必要的。</p>
<p>改良捐稅。取銷苛捐，重訂稅則，也是改革山東漁業听必要的條件。如果苛捐不取銷，則水產品之生產和暢銷上均要受其妨害，結果魚價高漲，銷路停滯，而生產也就因之不發達了。取消苛捐，在山東幾處漁業區域業已開始實行，而且收得了相當的成效。重訂稅則，目前即應實行，吾則只見外貨充斥，自己的漁業經濟無從振興，反之，只有日漸破產而已。「作繭自縛」，是誰之咎？</p>
<p>以上十項，僅是一個改革計劃大綱，至於如何措施？如何進行？都是政府當局和漁業專家仍所應有的責任了。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （嚴懋德）</p>
<p>時間一秒一秒的過去，因此人生愈短促，所以我們應該加緊馬鞭，努力工作，勿使有一些時間荒廢了。文學家萊蒙托夫說：「時間是我們的戰馬，迅速馳聘的戰馬」。這話可以做我們的座右銘。</p>

<p>「天下不如意事，常十之八九。」在現在社會中，隨時隨地，都能使我們受重大刺激。但我們需要刺激，正如生活需要空氣一樣。惡劣的環境，正是我們產生有希望的人生好塲所。所謂「吃得苦中苦，方爲人上人。」豐盛的佳果，原藏在荆棘叢中。</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統的攝生術</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>現任美國大總統羅斯福，很重衛生，每日運動一點十五分鐘，每夜睡足八點鐘，每晨在牀上進餐，這幾條簡單攝生方法，他遵行有年，因此身體很覺康健，這是他的醫士美海軍大尉麥克英台爾傳授的。據麥氏說：這種習慣，無論何人，都應該遵守的，羅總統的運動術，每星期至少有五夜游泳二十分鐘，並且時常在運動之後按摩週身，這是在公畢之後晚餐之前實行的。羅總統每日午夜之前必就寢，晨間八時在牀上淮餐，晚間無政務會商，他便以讀書和收集郵票消磨光陰。有時看看電影，因爲白宮中有一個私用小電影所。凡各公司新出的佳片，總送白宮放映。據麥氏吿客，羅總統的體况，從無像現在這麼康健的。麥氏又說：羅總統從不點製餐品，但揀心愛的飽啖他的精神强旺，辦事不辭勞瘁，幼年時曾患軟足病，綿延多年，但今日已病根全除，這多由於他的意志力極强，他以爲此病纏身，一生的事業將被斷送，所以努力和病魔奮鬬，而獲勝利。「自强不息」這四個字，是很可以奉贈羅總統的。</p>
<h3>誘惑</h3>
<p>— 闌删</p>
<p>倘若你行到那條文化之街，——四馬路棋盤街的別稱，——附近一帶的衖口，又倘若你是一個年靑的小夥子時，你的身邊一定有個善於鑒貌辨色的老槍擦過來，以最動聽的低音誘惑着你：「阿要買一套新出的春×」？如果你一聲不響的向前去了，他倒不來拖你。假使你朝他看一眼，或是牙縫裏洩出些兒聲音來，他便老把你纏着，跟你跑幾步路，嘴裹說得更動人，不將你引入衖堂裏，做成功他的不正當的小買賣不止。</p>
<p>讀者須知，他賣的不是別物，却是那些害人最深的淫畫。這些不道德的老槍們，是專向靑年肌友進攻的，那完全是利用靑年人的好奇心。靑年們旣然招惹了他就得買他的畫；買了之後，從此父要多一種煩惱了。—精神上和肉體上，皆所不免。</p>
<p>甚願當局對於這些老槍們，加以嚴密的查緝取締，救救那些未經人道而血氣方剛的青年！</p>
<h3>閒話金魚</h3>
<p>— 愛梅</p>
<p>予於昔年，具金魚癖，間嘗徵諸古籍，俾得按圖索驥，搜求異種；供今檢行篋，舊稿猶存，蕞錄數條，藉世之同嗜者參考。</p>
<p>羣芳譜：「金魚有鯉，鯽，鰍，鼈，數種，鰍，鼈，允難得，獨金鯽耐久。……初出黑色，久乃變紅，又或變白，名銀魚。有三尾，五尾者，甚且有七尾</p>
<p>養魚經：「五色文魚，其色相本異，而金魚特總名也。初尙純紅，純白，連顋紅，鶴頂紅；繼尙雪眼，珠眼，紫眼，瑪瑙眼，琥珀眼；至十二紅，二六紅；甚有所謂十二百，及堆金砌玉，落花流水，隔斷紅塵，蓮台八瓣；命名種種不一。」又：「神品，都出由花魚，將來變幻，可勝紀哉！，而紅頭種類，竟屬庸板矣」。又：「眼貴紅凸；然必泥此，無金魚矣。乃紅忌黃，白忌蠟」。又：「三尾，四尾品，尾原係一種，體材近滯，而色都鮮艷，可當其品。第金管，銀管，廣陵，新都，姑蘇，競珍之。」</p>
<p>山堂肆考：「金魚，一名火魚，色象各各不同；碧鷄山下，有洞，內有金綫魚，中都有金錢魚，雪質而黑章，的礫若黍，儼然玳瑁，文采尤可觀也」。</p>
<p>正字通：「金魚，吉安有一身具五色者，名手巾魚。」</p>
<p>閩書：「金魚有數種，而金箍魚最佳；又有寸金魚。」</p>
<p>粵志：「金魚咬子時，以大蝦蓋之，則多蝦尾；又以撒開象芙蓉葉者爲佳，謂之芙蓉尾。」按：此法予曾試之，果如所言。</p>
<p>又嘗記有古人詠金魚之名句，吉光片羽，亦屬可珍。如蔡羽詩：「古崖屏風靑，冰壺金鯉赤。」馬玉麟詩：「出入微波霞作片，吐吞細雨錦爲麟。」徐中行詩：「朱麟射赤日，火鬣走黃金。」王穉登詩：「簾攏寂寂雨斜斜，一寸金麟似赤砂。」歸有光詩：「勺水停淵澄，一方池恣回繞。「他如，蘇軾復游西湖詩：「我識南屏金鯽魚，重來拊檻散齋餘」一。吳國倫宮詞：「媆荷香撲釣魚亭，水面文魚作隊行。」皆足爲金魚生色者也</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十二回　俠語動脂唇羣姝集議　虛情驚玉腕苦女逃囚</p>
<p>這裏面有一件很奇怪的事，便是那位事主月英姑娘，始終在屋子裏藏着並沒有出來，好像這樣一塲大熱鬧，與他無關似的。那周太太站在過廳裏人叢中，向四處張望了一會子，便道；這位朱女—呢：怎麼到了他本人，倒是不肯露面。只這一句話，就有兩位女賓，帶推帶拉，把他擁了出來。那月英姑娘，倒是難爲情似的，低了頭，不肯抬起來。周太太道；朱女土，你不用害怕。你不看到我們這樣和他吵嘴嗎？他果然有理，我們和他這樣大吵大鬧，他早也就把我們推走了。你看，現在他不但不能推走我們，我們反是把他　走了，趁了這個樣會，你就快快的走罷。月英抬起頭來噗嗤一笑。立刻又把臉色正住了，因道：這樣我怎麼敢走？我們是窮人，又住得近，假使他報了官，把我一家人都關了起來，我們到那裏去伸寃？周太太就指着藍夫人道：這是專員太太，吿到官裏，自有他專員出來作主。月英聽到專員專員的，鬧了一天一晚，腦筋裏已很有印象了。不就是昨天晚上，在樓上聽到哭聲，大發脾氣的那個女人嗎？怎麼今天又大發慈悲，放出好心腸，倒來替人帮忙呢？心裏這樣想着，眼睛可就不由得向藍夫入連連瞟了一眼。只看他站在一羣太太後而，臉上放出一種得意的樣子，輕輕的拍了胸道：他要把你吿到居去、你就說是我把你拖了出來的，官要辦人，辦我們就是了。月英又是向大家看看，沒有作聲。可是那眼神由這羣太太臉上，橫掃了過來，就掃到在報桌上翻報的那個王北海臉上來。北海自也不免微微抬頭，向他身上瞟了兩眼，就不期在這個常兒，兩個入對射了一下。月英想不到北海還會在這裏等着，因之那兩片臉腮，紅出了兩塊大血彙。這裏一羣太太誰也不會想到他另外還有一個少年男子在心眼要，所以依然衆星拱月一般把月英包圍着。（三八五）</p>

<p>江允虎博士游興殊豪，近自西北歸來，息影滬上，寓居辛家花園淸凉寺，予與之暌違者半載有餘，乃於一昨往訪之。抵寺，博士殷勤接待，詢別後狀况，甚爲懇摯，而神采依舊，毫無風塵之色，則其平日之修養可知。博十謂：「此决所歷凡五省，而以出塞至內蒙古，印象尤深，曾蒞百靈廟，爲彼方之偉大建築，德王福王，特飭所部奏凱旋樂以娛客，凱旋樂者，成吉思汗所製之曲也。厥聲激楚，嗚嗚動人，而前面爲女兒山，亂磧荒沙，日色悽黯，對此境象，益覺百感交集，不能自己。而蒙人之最敬禮，爲全羊宴，烤羊一頭，且割且啖，木椀骨箸，異常簡樸，佐之者爲焦粟，無所用其醇醪飯顆也。」博士且言捻佛珠一串，光澤特異，視之，博士曰：「此西康所產之星月菩提子，蜀中超一禪師所見貽者也，」因指示每子各有一小孔，無數黑點繞之，如衆星之拱月，蓋完全出於天然，不假人力，自屬名貴可喜也。臨別，承贈最近在北平刋行之「江亢虎思想一斑，」頗多關於文化之討論，最爲予所服膺者，如謂：「中國文化所有遺蹟，第一步常無條件的尊重保存，第二步當本世界眼光，用科學方法，比較研究，分析整理，第三步當儘量發揮其優點，設法補充其缺點，必如是中國文化乃爲活文化，而非死文化；有世界性，且有未來性；但非兼通他種文化，並能應用現代文化者，不能担當此責任，完成此使命，故一面當與歐美之文化學者合作，一面當向世界爲中國文化宣傳，」不偏不倚，洵爲中庸之談，聞博士擬在海上盤桓一二月，每日午前會客，午後著書，俟舊歷歲杪，然後赴平度歲，日內頗思一訪馬相伯老人，一叙二十年之契闊云。</p>
<p>小常識</p>
<h3>冬季之疾病預防法</h3>
<p>— 朱靑雲</p>
<p>天是這般的寒冷，偶而不小心，就容易患着疾病：加以風勁天燥，皮膚上就容易起着龜坼，或發生凍　，不但肉體上飽受痛苦，就是精神方面，當然也有哭不出的苦處。在養尊處優的富貴人家，尙有奴婢可供使喚；窮人們有了疾病，那就苦不堪言了。所以俗語說得好：「窮人的身體，富人的金錢。」窮人們有了健全的身體，才能胼手胝足，爲生活掙扎，混一口飯吃。所以對於疾病的預防，却不可不懂得些常識，下面的幾種預防法，雖是不値錢，然而却都是經渦實騐的有效方法。</p>
<p>凍瘃預防法冷天因爲血液容易停流的關係，凍　是幾乎普通人們必犯的皮膚病。這雖然一種小病，然到淸爛之後，非到春回大地，氣候溫暖，就難有痊愈之望，一個冬季就够苦惱了。凍　發生的原因，大都是爲缺少運動之故，所以一班勞動份子，不大會生凍瘃；其决就爲了骸國關係，所以預防凍瘃的主要辦法，當然是努力運動動於沐浴，使患處的血液，常有迅速流動之可能，凍瘃根本就不會發生了。其次是保暖法，在患凍瘃的所在，早早使他溫暖如凍瘃的脚上，天氣一冷，立即改着棉鞋，在這種防禦下，假使仍還覺得發癢時，趕快將新棉花蘸着洋油，先把熱水將患處洗凈，趁着熱的時候，將洋油棉花，在患處揩擦，然後用乾棉花包好，不使着冷。（最好在臨睡時做）這樣至多四五决，患處就會縐皮化散，至於潰爛以後，那就不易治了，市上出售的凍瘃藥，雖然名目繁多，然有實效的，我却還沒有試騐判呢</p>
<p>咳嗽預防法　大冷汛裏，屋外的空氣，是那麼的冷，而室內有些人家，或裝着火爐；在道冷熱不調的環境中，一個不小心，就容易傷風咳嗽，預防的方法，當然注意衣服的寒暖，以略帶溫暖爲主。假使發生了傷風咳嗽，也有幾種實騐的丹方：貴些的，將生杏仁搗汁，加入氷糖，煮成杏酪；其决將生梨挖去心，加入川貝，氷糖，在飯鑊上將氷糖燉成糖汁；或將冬瓜子氷糖煎湯，在臨睡時喝下，就蒙被而腫，出一身汗，自然霍然了。</p>
<p>喉痛預防法　冷天因爲容易和火爐接近，而暖鍋等，又大都生着炭火，天寒氣燥，人們的喉嚨，往往因火燥而發生喉痛，及嘴碎的毛病，預防之法，最好是仿照歐美人的吃西餐，在吃過飯後，吃一隻橘子，或一隻生梨。如果因爲水果價昂，價廉些，還是吃些生蘿蔔，並且生蘿蔔絲，和鹹蘿蔔，還是很好的菜肴旣可防了疾病，父可下粥下飯，可稱一舉兩得。至於喉痛發生以後，最簡便的洽療法，在喉頭紅腫的所在，點」些食鹽，其他是喝些鹽湯或靑橄欖湯，假使不是白喉，那是很容易痊愈的。</p>

<h3>第四次全國醫師代表大會會務報告（上）</h3>
<p>— 徐乃禮</p>
<p>一　執行第三屆代表大會决議各案之經過</p>
<p>上屆大會中所提出之議案，計六十三件，除醫字第一七，四一，四六，四九，五九號案，由原提案人自動撤銷，醫字第二五，二六，三九，五五，號案，經大會議决撤銷，醫字第二四，二七，五七號案議决不成立，醫字第五三號案議决原則通過，辦法留至下屆大會開會時再行討論，及臨時提案三件，因時間不及，保留交下屆大會討論外，其餘四十七伴，業經遵照當時决議，分別執行，每値執監聯席會議執行委員例會，迭經提出報告，並在醫事彙刋會務欄內發表，最近且製成簡表，附刋七卷四號醫事彙刋中，諒已邀覽，茲再擇其要者，爲諸公一縷陳之：</p>
<p>關於提高醫師公會職權及醫師公會法原則草案等案，醫字第一，九，二三，五二，及六〇號案，雖大會所决議者，並未指定合併辦理，但經執行委員會審查結果，完全有相聯關係，爰經三屆四决執委會議决，將各案彙集，並錄同歷來關於醫師公會法之言論事實，印發各地，徵求意見，自二十三年冬發出後，計半年之間，絡續收到各方回信簽註，根據前衛生部醫師會法草案參加意見，俾供當局採納，嗣又經全體執監委買詳細簽註，最近又經常務委員整理就緒，全國輿論似已一致，惟爲愼重起見，特將三屆二决執監　席會議之意見，再提出本屆大會，請予討論。</p>
<p>於整理歷屆人會議决谷案，並促政府實行本會建議各議案等案，醫字第五，一六，五六，號案，早經常務委員會督同幹事，依大會意旨，切實整理。結果製成簡表，迭經提出執行委員會議討論，將建議各項，彙爲意見書，於二十四年歲首呈請衛生署採納，（全文載醫事彙刋七卷一號）奉批存備參考，其他各案，除因時效關俘者外，莫不分別實施，並將辦理經過，彙同歷屆議案，列表刋入醫事彙刊第七卷第三，四兩號公布，大致可吿一段落。所最引憾者，旱請政府實施之案伴，每被留中，（如醫事建設及實施大綱一案，幾經起草，幾費審查，曾於二十四年三月具呈行政院，請其採納，迄今消息沉沉，由此可見一般矣，）卽使奉批，亦屬浮汎之辭，並無負責表示，此爲歷來公事上積習，固不獨對吾醫會爲然，故欲敦促政府實行本會建議，除私人接洽外，至今未獲相當途徑，實覺有負全體會員之期望矣。</p>
<p>關於建議敎育部衛生署切實注意衛生敎育等案，（醫字第三五，三七，五〇，號案，）業於二十三年夏，將大會議决之四項主張，一，請敎育部組織衛生敎育委員會，二，審查敎科書時應請中小學敎科書課程標準起草委員會參加審查工作，三，請衛生署多準備衛生敎育材料，四，請敎育部通令敎育機對於衛生設備環境改良，保健事項，積極辦理等，備文呈請去後，奉敎育部批，已組織中小學衛生敎育設計委員會，衛生敎材亦已於中小學課程標準內明白規定，並奉衛生署批，除關於衛生敎材之預備，由本署積極辦理外，敎育部範圍已轉咨核辦云云，是本案已獲相當結果。</p>
<p>關於助產敎育及助產待遇案（醫字一三及二一號案）早經三屆四决執委會推出專家，依大會審查報吿，反覆討論，結果歸納成十一項於二十四年六月，分呈敎育部及衛生署提供意見，當時適★海各助產學校爲部頒新條例有所請願曾推代表入京，傳聞當局口頭有採納本會意見之表示，然迄今未奉批示，其採納之稈度如何，則須待今後事實之證明矣。</p>
<p>關於成立病理解剖同志會，並表彰余子維先生案，（醫字八，一二號）茲已依大會决議辦理，惟其間因原推起草病理解剖同志會章程之龐京周委員出國考察，及收集余子維事蹟頗費時日，故同志會章稈直至二十四年十一月初始克公　，而余先牛紀念冊，亦至最近始附於醫事彙刋七卷四號發行，至於同志會之正式成立，想亦不遠，已由原發起人徵求同志，惟望吾會全體一致努力推廣耳。</p>
<p>關於組織急務保障　員會，及人才介紹醫務設計委員會各案，（醫字第二八，及三，三六，四二號案）自經大會通過後，執委會一再討論，認爲對於醫事糾紛，暫照向例，如遇特別情形時，可再組織專門委員會解决之，在此二年之中，是項委員會之組織，已經四决如杭州裘案常熟顧案，蕪湖王案魏案等是也，後文尙須詳細報吿，至於人才介紹及醫務設計委員會，業經三屆二决執監聯席會議將章程修正公布，並由三屆二十一决執委會議中，暫推常務委員兼任常任委員，負責進行。</p>
<p>關於整理新藥及提倡創辦醫材藥械廠案，（醫字第一五，三〇，三一號）大會議决與上海市醫師公會新藥整理委員會合作進行，嗣於三屆二决執行委員會推定陳方之，謝筠壽，吳濟華，前往參加，惟該會爲情勢關係，工作遲滯，故尙無成績可舉。</p>
<p>他如一，設立通俗演講會，（醫字二號）採用國製醫藥用品，（醫字四號）取締非法墮胎，（醫字十九號）統一度量衡，（醫字二〇號）取消國別冠詞，（醫字三二號）等五案，均已分別通吿各會　團體照辦，二，廣設騐屍所，（醫字十號）編審衛牛書籍採用同一名詞，（醫字三三號）檢騐入口之外國藥品（醫字四十號）梭醫應聘正式醫師，（翳字五一號）管理外籍醫師，（醫字五八號）等五案，則已分別呈請主管官署，得其批覆，尙不致爲所漠視，三，各縣　增設衛生技術人員規定衛生經費並規定衛生人員資格各案，（醫字七，二二，四四，四八，五四等號）則已於二十四年歲首彙入本會所貢獻於衛生署之意見書中，奉批存備參考矣，四，取消漢口市診所登記暫行規則（醫字四七號）一案，雖經二决呈衛生署力爭，惟微聞結果不甚圓滿。</p>
<p>最後尙須報吿者，如（一）取締濫施注射針藥及手術。（醫字六、一四號）增設醫　專科學校，（醫字十一、廿九號）設立衛生警察訓練所，（醫字一八號）醫用文字應以國文爲主體，（醫字三四號）厲行毒物法規，（醫字三八號）通令地方政府不得規定診金（醫字四五號）等案，均經分別呈請主管當局施辦，（二）闡研國產藥物以挽利權（醫字四三號）一案，亦經函請經委會衛生實騐處辦理，事極切要，詎皆留中不覆，　則同人等所引疚而自認爲執行不力者也。</p>
<p>二　辦理本會立案問題之經過</p>
<p>本會成立六年，初因所屬統系未有明文規定，迭向上級機關請求立案，每遭婉却，自人民團體組織　公布以後，曾根據條文，申請上海特別市黨部登記，呈文甫進，而中央停止登記之令忽下，遂吿延擱，二十三年夏，聞前令取消，始再具呈市黨部，請其通融，補予備案，手續　繁，費時自久，故批准之令，直至除夕方接，同時根據組織法所規定，將本會圖章，依式改製，爰於二十四年元旦，有啟用新章之通吿，然此尙初步，依法於批准之後，應再請市黨部派員視察，核發健全訓令，始准分向主管官署，請求備案，詎中央黨部民訓會，忽飲令我改名全國醫師公會聯合會，並須加入舊醫團體，以更組織，波瀾倐起，而立案問題，又覺遙遠，嗣經書面解釋，縷述困　情形，請　黨部轉覆，公牘往還，又大費周折，結果幸邀俯諒，至去秋，乃獲姑准仍舊之續命，至此始吿段落，嗣又重經依法呈請，故接奉健全訓令，已在去冬十一月，隨向行政院衛生署內政部呈請備案，雖均於短時日內，卽獲邀准，然前後費時不少，洵非易事也。</p>
<p>三　處理醫病糾紛各案之經過</p>
<p>此二年中所經過之醫病糾紛訟案，計有七條，茲特摘要報吿如下：</p>
<p>杭州市醫師公會會員裘伯勳醫師，因王雪飛，病死被誣，初刺審决失當，來文請加檢討一案，曾於二十三年三月推專家劉以祥周景文陳方之余霖駱傳榮五君審查，並根據專家意見，函請浙省高等法院參考，嗣聞二審判决無罪，方謂世間尙有公道，不意去年，最高法院發回更審，而重審結果，又不獲直，爰於九月續請原有專家再付審查茲雖已經具文向最高法院貢獻意見，第不知結果如何，洵堪注意。</p>
<p>南通樂仁醫院尹樂仁醫師，被病家誣訴一案，本會接得報吿後，曾於二十三年八月函請南通地方法院，將訴訟文伴副本寄會，以供研究，不料此函尙未獲覆，而案已判决，罰余千元，殊駭聽聞，後經上訴於江蘇高等法院始判决無罪云。</p>
<p>常熟醫師公會送來該地產科顧志和女士被訴案件，請作學術上研究一案，曾於二十三年八月推金問洪瞿紹衡林惠貞三專家審查，並將審查意見去覆，聞此案因此獲有相當結果。</p>
<p>蕪湖醫師公會爲會員鍾壽芝被病家無理控吿，請求主張公道一案，因當初未將全卷送來，曾於二十三年十月去信催補，嗣聞鍾醫師宜吿無罪，而該院護士則受小公道之宣判，爰於去年九月，推專家宋國賓顧毓琦夏慎初劉之綱沈德五君審查，當卽擬具意見，函送安徽高等法院參考，藉申學理，而衛無辜，</p>
<p>南昌醫學會來函，爲江明劉懋淳二醫帥，被控案件，判决失當，請予聲援，當時因此兩案，早有學術團體研究，蹬明在學理上毫無者任可言。爰經去年三月五日，常務委員會提出審查，曾將二案相似之點，彙爲意見書，寄江西高等法院，藉作聲援。</p>
<p>廣州市醫師公會會員洗家齊，在廣西地方，被江氏誣訴一案，去年五月曾推余霖張致果謝筠壽三專家審查，亦經擬具意見書，逕寄廣西高等法院，請其參考矣。</p>
<p>最近蕪湖醫師公會寄來魏文霸醫師被控案卷，雖纏訟久年，事由複雜，核其關於中毒部份，採證失當，於學理</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>上不無可議，愛亦於去年十月，推陳方之劉之綱沈德三專家審査，提出意見，送安徽高等法院參考。</p>
<p>此外尙須連附報吿者，卽年來醫病糾紛案件，與時俱增，開業醫師，法無保障，殊非社會人羣之福，爰於去年一月二十五日第三屆第十三次執行委員會議席上，議决調査全國醫病糾紛案例，以便彙齊研究，洞燭癥結，藉求根本防杜之道，現在已將收到各案，分別於醫事彙刋中發表，今後尙擬請全體會員合作，代為徵集，以備將來組織專門委員會審査研討。</p>
<h3>論法律思想之變遷而影響於醫制</h3>
<p>— 汪企張</p>
<p>粵古帝王御世。統屬萬姓。國法家法也。商書曰。萬方有罪。罪在朕躬。韓非子曰。人主不能明法。而以制大臣之威。無道得小人之信矣。人主釋法。而以臣備臣。則相愛者。比周而相譽。相憎者。朋黨而相非。非譽交爭。則主惑亂矣。人臣者。非名譽請謁。無以進取。非肯法專制。無以為威。非假於忠信。無以為禁。三者惛主。壞法之資也。於以知帝王時代之所謂法。人主之淫威。臣下之詐偽而已。史稱漢高入關。與父老的法三章。似接受民意。而脫離帝王對象之一種表現。其實不外收拾人心之權術。故我國上下數千年。政體如此。主義如此。法律亦如此也。顧彼泰西各國。亦何獨不然。上中世紀之經過情形。茲姑不論。讀近世史。法蘭西大革命前。其法律思想。學者皆認為警察國時代。蓋其絕對主權之操持者。厥為國王。授意朝臣。奉為準則。絕不知法律乃社會之規範。舉凡人民。在國法上。應有一定之權利與人格一層。此思想不惟夢想所不及。時或偶言。將遭不測。是帝王時代之專制淫威。炙手可熱。本無足怪。所以路易十四。有朕卽國家之語也。不寗惟是。君民上下。相互為因。朋比其間。玩弄法則。孟子之所謂。縱有井田良法。暴君汚吏。必慢其經界者。蓋謂此也。於是乎國法弛矣。人民苦矣。徵此以觀。古者之所謂國法。殆為帝王一家。並官吏之私物。絕不知有公布之事。一二學者。或加研究。且目為叛逆。指為訟師。嗚呼。天賦人權。剝奪盡矣。自法國大革命。盧梭等輩。絕叫自由。而不自由母寗死之新聲。遂風靡四海。世間始如大夢初覺。知人民實為國家之全體。應享受法律上權利。須保持個體之人格。而憲法的法之眞義。方實現於世。恍然於國法。宜共尊共守者也。故自拿破崙法典公布以降。至挽近各國之法律趨勢。自第一章開宗明義。至最後結尾。一貫的以人民之權利為主觀。或享有。或行使。或讓渡變更。或救濟。詳加規定無遺。簡言之。近代之法律趨勢。個入醒覺之現狀也。近徵束鄰日本。雖仍維其帝制。溯在明治以前。固不脫朕卽國家之勢。然自維新而后。初不由人民自動。而有五條御誓文之頒布。蓋惕於泰西潮流之東漸。不得不尊重民權也。其後。遂發布憲法。而擺脫警察國之範。以入法治國之域。其國民基本法之民法第一條。卽規定私權之享有。與承認人民法律上之人格。直至最後第千一百四十六條。始終認定保障人民在法律上之權利。所以取得其國籍之人民。不論任何階級。所受法律上之拘束者。其本位。實係權利兩字而已。英吉利。雖自來君主政體。然自行君主立憲后。人民應有權利。亦得其保障。而上下翕然矣。</p>
<p>最近時勢變遷。人心漾盪。歐美各國之法律思想。更漸脫個人醒覺之域。而進入社會之醒覺範圍。卽個人權利之本位。乃對於社會義務之本位是巳。蓋其思想。巳越超自由民權時代。而不以個人之權利。受國家之承認為滿足矣。換言之。人民個人。不必爭執應得如何之權利。當以此權利。致力於國家社會。以為職志。更詳言之。國家旣承認各個人之權利矣。而個人不可自私自利。白由行動。各遂其私欲。必也。發展而活用之。以有利於國家社會。為最大目的。所以共所主張個人之權利。並非因個人而主張。乃社會而主張之一種義務。譬如富者。在其主張權利之先。不可不利用其富。與社會共之。貧者。主張權利之先。不可不供其體力。與社會共之。如是。富者。有利用其富之義務。而貧者。有供給其力之義務。凡此義務之原動。殆皆由社會所促成。是乃今日個人主張權利之前提也。於是國家之行政。無論其為取締行政。警察行政。其實皆助長行政也。所以國家對於人民主張絕對之權力。亦不得不有希冀其貢之社會。以助長社會之義務。譬若有特殊能力之我醫師。經國家承認而登記之。是賦與其權利矣。然醫師。為社會服務之分子。負服務社會之義務。因其能盡義務。始有相當權利之享受。是卽義務。應為權利之前提。蓋最近法律思想之趨勢。世界文明各國。殆取於同軌矣。卽由權利為本位之法律。轉移而為以義務為本位之法律矣。以個人為本位之法律。轉移而為以社會為本位之法律矣。</p>
<p>吾國醫制。說者以為自近二十年。有衛生科。衛生局。衛生部。衛生署。而始有法律之規定。其實吾醫制之設。早發端於上古。周禮天官云。醫師上士二人。下士四。府二人。史二人。徒二十人。掌醫之政令。聚毒藥。以共醫　。又曰。凡邦之有疾病者。有庀瘍者。造焉。則使醫分而治之。歲終。則稽其醫事。以制其食。十全為上。十失一决之。十失二决之十失。三决之。十失四為下。又曰。疾醫。中土八人。掌養萬民之疾病。以五味。五穀。五藥。養其病。以五氣。聲五五色。眠其生死。又曰。瘍醫。下士八人。掌腫瘍。潰瘍。金瘍。折瘍。之祝藥制殺之齊。是以萬民傷疾為主觀。而設醫編制焉。又曰。食醫。中士二人。掌和王之六食。六飲。六膳。百羞。百醫。八珍之齊。凡君子之食。恒倣焉。此雖專供御用之醫。而暗愚飲食示民以標準。知古之醫制。殆為人民而設也。及中世紀。君權膨脹。遂只有太醫院之設置。是專供帝王之家族之需。去國家設醫之本旨遠矣。</p>
<p>近三五十年中。我國醫界。漸入覺醒時期。或唱醫權之擴張。或主醫權之擁護。一片聲囂。將以求得醫師個人權利之保障。所請由取締主義。而入醫之權利主張時代矣。換言之。醫師職務。已在國家法律保障之下。而得自由行使矣。醫師權利。已在國家法律保障之下。而可無虞喪失矣。徵前。有衛生部正式登記醫師之令。後有衛生署通融登記醫師之令。宜乎醫制之已人正軌。而無疑義矣。然吾醫師本位。今後當應時勢潮流。脫離個人之域。而為國家社會服務之公僕。宜本此目標與主旨。為國家社會犧牲貢獻。盡其天職。不當如從前醫卜星相視同一例時代之以個人權利。聚歛居積為心。庶幾不失其人格職位。而合乎現代醫制之本旨矣。孔子曰。所謂士人者。知不務多。必審其所知。言不務多。必審其所謂。行不務多。必審其所由。知旣知之。言旣道之。行旣由之。則若性命之形骸之不可易也。富貴不足以益。貧賤不足以損。鑒於此。吾今日之醫師。知所處矣。</p>
<h3>波蘭衛生事業概况</h3>
<p>— 章尹明</p>
<p>衛生費佔全國政費百分之七</p>
<p>全國有衛生所三百六十餘處</p>
<p>醫的對象不僅限於醫治個人的病。應該擴充到整個社會或整個民族上去。換言之。就是醫的最終目的。乃在增進或保障民衆健康。醫學的一切技能。應當作為服務全民健康的技術。並非單純以營利為目的。國家的公共衛生事業。就是以全民健康為目標。把事業設施健全組織起來。所以一國衛生事業之良吾。足以判別其國民健康的程度。全世界各國的衛生事費以美國為最多。　佔全行政費百分之十七强。日本德國决之。的為白分之十三。我國則僅佔千分之一左右。相去遠甚。年前國聯特派其衛生部長拉西曼來華。協助建設事業。對於我國的衛生行政。狠有不少貢獻。拉氏是波蘭人。主持波蘭衛生行政多年。有極豐富的經騐。波蘭復國雖僅有十七年短促的歷史。因為全國一　努力。各項建設猛晋。工商業欣欣向榮。就是衛生行政也有特殊的畏處。是為我國師法。波蘭的醫學。與德奧齊名。功國各地有不少波蘭名醫。內外科均有　長。波蘭全國衛生事業費的佔全部行政費百分之七強。組織異常嚴密。其中央衛生行政直屬於內政部。辦理全國衛生設施　疫保健工作。每省有一衛　處。由著　醫師充處長。每區再設一專任衛生行政長官。均由內政部衛生司委派。衛生行政長官下設衛生稽査若干名。視察地方衛生考績。報吿長官取締及管理之。此外全國共有衛牛所三百六十餘處。衛生所主任均係公共衛生專家。其職務為衛生視察。食品檢査。預防疫厲。辦理門診病人。家庭訪問。婦嬰訪問等。較我國普通公立醫院範圍為擴大。於全民健康確有直接關係。每衛生所區域內約有六萬至十　的人口。全國衛生所每年經費的需六百餘萬波金。其來源則政府佔百分之九。民衆捐助百分之七三。保險費百分之八。收費百分之五。美國羅氏基金百分之二。其他百分之三。衛生所與民衆有直　發生關係。除去免費治病外。尙有化騐室。公共洗衣房。公共浴室。牛乳廚房的設備。以最低廉的價格。供給　衆以衛生上的便利。此外關於衛生敎育方面。有公共衛生學校下設各種，期訓練班。如公共衛生講習班。衛生工程講習班　衛生稽査訓練班。公共衛生護士訓紗班等。凡一切衛生行政人員均須受嚴格的公共衛生訓練。故波蘭衛生事　確實辦有相當成績。全民健康無形中年有增進也。</p>

<p>讓我舉出若干可笑的例子來吧。赫爾蒙脫（Van　Helmont，1577-1644）是latro-chemicak學派的提倡者。他說：每一種生理法則各由一種特殊的精靈掌理；他用一種特殊的酵因或氣體以完成牠的機能或消滅牠的機能。這些方法的始祖都博得一身盛大名譽，被入當作好醫生好敎師看待。在蓋冷（Galen）與梅霞（Mayo）兄弟之間，名譽最大的大概算是婆爾海胡（Boerhave，1668-1738）了。據傳說，有一個中國官吏寫一封信寄給「歐洲最著名的醫生；這封信就是遞給婆爾海胡的。請他看病的人非常擁擠。有一决，彼得大帝請他看病，居然等候了一整夜，因為他對於病人是不因貴賤而加歧視的。他採用的是折衷療治術，大致以各種藥物間的「親和力」為基礎。據說，他的藥方的效力還不及他和病人見一面的效力來得大。和他同時代的，還有一個著名人物，就是的翰勃朗（John　Brown，1735-788）他的「勃魯諾寗方法（Brunonian　System）成了後極大的爭論。這就是：在他死後二十二年，各丁金大學（Universityof　Gottigen）中的学生分为「勃魯諾寗」與「非勃魯諾寗」兩派，兩派爭辯頗烈，卒至雙方用武，用馬隊壓制纔得平服。所謂勃魯諾寗方法，是以各種人體組織的「受刺戟性」為某礎的：根據疾病是「盛」或「虛」，療治的方法就用「刺戟」或「壓制」。假如你患的是「盛」病，他就給你一個壓制藥物—雅片。他的理論的前提是：「生命不是自然狀態」。醫藥歷史家裴斯（Hermann　Bas[as)曾批評說：「要是人身不具有矯正醫生的過失的自然能力，那就被勃魯諾寗方法所戕害的生命要比死於法南西革命和拿破侖戰役的人數的總和更大了。」</p>
<p>到了病理學的眞正科學方法被採用以後，這些病理的幻想家便逐漸絕跡了。所謂病理學的眞正科學方法是什麽呢？這就是：生存時期的徵候的觀察和死後的身體檢騐相比較，相對核。這就是被稱為屍體檢騐的方法了。波尼忒斯（Thesghilc　Bonetus）是第一個從事屍體檢騐記錄的研究者。在波尼忒斯以前，固然也有許多叫於屍體檢騐的秘密的記錄，但那些都不及他的記錄未得公開和成系統。他的著作，Spnlchrefum是於一六七九年出版的。</p>
<p>Sepnlchretum所叙述的，從身體的頂端開始就是關於頭痛的記錄。各式各樣的頭痛給叙述着，然後就每一例子詳細記錄從屍體檢騐所得的內部器官的變化。他是去棄了理論的觀察而注重明白的事實的。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>「告復旦同學書」</h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>上海各大中學晋京請願的學生昨日回來了，雖然這次的結果並不能儘如初願那麼的達到，雖然在凄風苦雨中相持達五書夜，雖然因爲十二小時的沒有水喝而不得不捧起雪來當作飲料，……總之，雖然歷盡艱辛，結果還是半途折回，然而那種奮發有爲，百折不回的大無畏精神，可是已經使全世界的人士以深深的感動，知道中國的民衆並不是「羔羊」。從這决驚天地而泣鬼神的事件裏，不僅顯示出集團的力量是如何的不可侮的更且是掃除了以前「大學生祗配享福，不能受苦」的近乎侮辱的讕言。至少，從這决偉大的英勇的舉動中，給了我們確立的昭示現在的學生們已不比從前了，早已從威情的英雄主義的熱情衝動，而進居爲集團的理智的集合。</p>
<p>由這决英勇的舉動，我們不知該怎樣來表示我們的欽敬！</p>
<p>而在看到英勇的同學們回來的新聞同日，在報上，也看到了九六老人馬相伯先生的告復旦同學書。</p>
<p>馬先生的信雖是吿復旦同學的，然而在報上公開之後，也就不啻是吿全國同學的，而那封信的內容，也並不專指復旦同學；所以我們卽使說它是吿全國同學書，也未始不可。</p>
<p>「故諸君南京之行，縱成事實，亦屬無謂；惟國家柱石，端在人民，今日亡國現象，其根源首在人民之愚魯，誠看其他文明國家，有此等情形吾？其故可深長思矣。爲諸君計，與其呼籲政府，莫如開導人民，街頭巷尾，茶寮酒肆，皆諸君爲國宣力處也，務使彼等曉然於自身之力量與責任之所在，執干而起，戮力前驅，則諸君之所以盡其天職者，亦卽所以補政府敎育之力所不及……」</p>
<p>馬先生的話，是不錯的。要民族解放鬥爭得到最後的勝利，那是非轟轟烈烈的舉國一致的把民衆團結在一起不可，而要舉國一致的把民衆團結在一起，那就非僅僅做到「呼籲政府」為止。救亡運動如果祇是孤另另的學生運動，那麼失敗是可期的。</p>
<p>過去的經騐告訴我們，當國難到來時，站在時代前錢的智識靑年們總是第一個起來，可是，如果沒有別的團體來作爲後盾的話，這個運動也往往矢敗，我們並不否認學生運動在民衆運動中有推動的作用的但也並不諱言孤軍苦鬥，必歸失敗。</p>
<p>所以，「與其呼籲政府，莫如開導人民」，政府有政府的事，「縱成事實，亦屬無謂」；我們現在急切要幹的，是如何把全國民衆團結在一起，用全國民衆的力量，來督促政府執行我們的要求。</p>
<p>惟有集團的力量纔是最偉大的力量，我們在幾次來的經騐，已確信這樣的結論了；而請願回來，也正是「呼籲政府」的終止，「開導人民」的開始，「務使彼等曉然於自身之力量與責任之所在，「執干而起，戮力前驅」，用全民衆的力量，來保衛我們的國家。</p>
<h3>街景</h3>
<p>— 羅之華</p>
<p>屋里充滿了溫和的陽光。再不像往日亭子間里那樣的陰冷了；也不像剛才陰雨時的憂悶。</p>
<p>聽鄰室里的鐘，無力地敲過三點。肚子是餓了。我該去吃東西了，這窮困的生涯，是怎樣地愁人呀！等老金去借錢，已經三四個鐘頭，還沒見他的歸來，心里被焦燥瀰滿了。就只好走出屋子，到街頭去看一看，看一看那些擺在用玻璃裝著的精美的食品，心里也許會暫時的溫暖的。</p>
<p>走下樓梯口，恰巧碰到二房東，他遞給我一封信，帶著那種厭人的鄙視的眼色。</p>
<p>信是北平來的。我懷著驚喜拆開了；我懷念的北平呵，懷念的北平的友人呵。像看到北平，或北平的友人一樣的歡欣，我拆開了信，二房東側眼看了我一眼，走上去了。</p>
<p>「北平，這古老的東西，被我們的强健的呼聲，英勇的行動震動得發顫了。　信？開頭這樣說，「我們在零點以下的冰冷的風寒里，在那平時修整的王府井大街上走著，手臂腕着手臂，脚步整齊的，一切敵人都不能不被我們的行動威嚇著；但是，悲劇發生了；我們的隊伍被大刀，木棍，和自來水的噴射衝開了。這時，我們的羣衆憤怒地向他們攻去，佔據了水龍頭，進入他們的營壘。我們是勝利了，在冰冷的風寒里，强　的壓迫下。但是，朋友，我受傷了，我的肺受木棍的震動而毁壞了　最後他說：「現在，我被親熱的同學們送進醫院里來了，一閉起眼睛，那長長的行列，揮舞的手臂，就在晃動。我忠實地等待這行列的延長。」</p>
<p>讀著信，我的心跳躍得吏緊了。每一句話像一隻針刺激著我的神經，每讀一句話，全部靈魂像被吸引住了。隨讀著信，脚步慢慢地走出門來，弄堂口邊，堆擠著一排貨物似的，全是人。這些人像信上的話句一樣，吸引著我，加快脚步走出向前去。走在人衆的隊伍里。</p>
<p>這里的人，正是信上所說的那些人　他們穿著單薄的衣服，到處找賣食物的地方，他們餓了。</p>
<p>街上全被他們佔有了。昔日冷落的街市，於今成了一個集塲似的熱鬧。</p>
<p>他們找著每一家食物店，從大餅到麵包，一霎時全都吃光了。</p>
<p>我立在一家買包子的舖子前，看他們爭奪的購買的踴躍。一鍋剛剛出來，第二鍋還不够分配的。年靑人永遠是那樣地飢渴，永遠是那樣地英勇，他們身臨著敵人的時候，是一點見也不膽怯的。何况他們是身臨著這些食物，而他們正是飢餓呢。我聞著包子的香，肚子像忘却了餓。</p>
<p>我的手緊緊地握著友人的信，望著這里的年靑的人。心里緊緊地跳動著，血沸騰了。</p>
<p>這些人手里拿著一張白白的紙，上而印著黑黑的像用血寫著的字句，每　字像一朶火苗，在燒熱著人的眼睛。我，望著那些緊張的臉，從樓窗里伸出來的頭顱，就想起友人信里的語句，—一一閉起眼睛，那長長的行列，揮舞著的手臂，就在晃動。我忠實地等待這行列的延長。」現在，這行列，從北平延長到××了，忠實的友人呵，你看馬上就延長到全國了。</p>
<p>不一刻的工夫，隊伍結成了。四個人一排，四個人一排地，結成了長長的行列。</p>
<p>一陣口號喊了，從樓上的窗子里，從路上的行人羣里。</p>
<p>一個穿黃色制服的靑年人，跳到一個台子上，喊「歡迎民衆參加！」</p>
<p>我隨著別人進去了，握著那封信。</p>
<h3>幻想之什</h3>
<p>— 寒邨</p>
<p>安居</p>
<p>我常常有許多幻想，允其是　沉沉的冬夜，我在夜半醒來，聽着風在屋角上呼號，於是立刻沉入幻想中。</p>
<p>當然我是一個平凡的人，所以，卽使幻想，也是平凡的。我沒有想到過天外的瓊樓，我也沒有想到過人間的玉宇。我所想到的’只是自己的小小的希望</p>
<p>自然有許多希望，是不應該的。我許多希望，連我自己也覺得難爲情的：但我沒有理由，來隱匿我的眞實。</p>
<p>我也曉得，這一些並不能算得幻想，不過我却明明的當他幻想看的；何况拈出幻想兩字，正含有自己諷刺的意思</p>
<p>我總覺得自己是非常老了，至少至少，也得在四十歲左右。大概我的精力比人家不行得多，所以二十幾年短短的人生旅途，已經把這寂寞的旅人弄倦了</p>
<p>據說奮鬥是年靑的特徵，但我却十二分的需要安穩，郁達夫已經四十左右的人了，所以他有資格在今年春天作開始在杭州造二所屋子的幻想。（現在據說那所屋子已經造好了。那末他的幻想已經成了事實）而我却在少去他的二分之一的年歲的現在同樣想有一所房屋了。</p>
<p>我理想中的那所房屋，旣小在都市，也不在鄉邨，而在一個江南的小城裏，房屋一共五間，前邊一連三間，後邊一連二間。前邊三間中間，一間是客座，左邊一問是書室，右邊一間是臥室。後邊兩間，一間是廚房，一間是僕人的臥室。室內的東西是極簡單的够用而已。</p>
<p>在前邊三間屋的面前，有一塊空地，空地上，有四五株極大的槐樹。更前邊是一道竹籬，自然大門就開在竹籬間。籬下種着　十本芭蕉，籬上爬着些薔薇之類。春天畫是長長的，門靜靜的關着。薔薇花在竹籬上鬧熱的開着，但沒有一個人去管牠。</p>
<p>傍晚了，夕陽已經歛沒了，天靑得可愛，老槐的葉綠得快要染上人的衣袖，我一個人穿着鞋，慢慢的從書屋中走出，脚步輕輕的不讓自己聽到一些兒聲息，仰着頭，從槐葉的隙間望望天，然後再就所記得的詩句中搜尋一句來形容這時候的景色和心情。</p>
<p>天漸漸的黑了，第一個出頭的星星</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>在高處，閃着俏皮的眼睛。这眼睛，我是非常熟悉的，因為他就想起生着這雙眼睛的人，這一個人或則正遠在天邊，或則已歸黃土，或則是小別數朝，——這都沒有關係，總之，不在身邊。於是一根游絲一樣的悲哀從心上浮起，但你正要蓄意搜尋他又游絲一樣的飄忽，</p>
<p>夏天，槐葉綠得發黑，芭蕉也高接簷頭，好幾匹蟬在槐葉中拚命的叫着，因爲整天不停，耳朶中反而像沒有聲音一樣。我一個在槐蔭下用一張竹榻睡午覺，醒來的時候，就看看並不費力的筆記，再睡着時，書就讓他吊在地上。晚上，坐在竹榻上納凉，忽然幾個朋友走來，於是就互相談着無稽的故事。半夜過了，開了門，送他們回去，歸來暑氣全消，就回房去睡。</p>
<p>秋凉了，夏天的疲倦都要靠這時候恢復。我睡得極早，但醒來時正好夜半，窗外無數秋蟲像驟雨似的叫着，反復不能入睡，就披衣出戶，月明如畫，芭蕉葉上着了露水，反激起一片銀光，這時候，春夜的懶意，已經全沒有，代他的，是一片凉意；這凉意縈魂入骨，使我忘記一切。忽然遠處高樓上吹來一聲長笛，凄淸激越，好像連竹笛都要裂開的樣子，於是我就爲這笛聲吹起一片悲哀，幾乎忍不住自己的眼淚。月似乎更加皎潔，一兩片羅樣的輕雲，悠然的流過，激着月光作美麗的彩暈，蟲們大概也叫得倦了，大家一齊停止。只有牆根最弱的一匹，遝是歎息一樣的叫。不知道什麼時，銀河已經掛在短牆頭上了，忽然一聲淸越的雄鷄叫了起來。</p>
<p>冬日，雪連夜的下着。第二天，天已經晴了，傍晚金黃的太陽射在雪上，但是不能使雪溶化。我一個人站在門口，看着熟悉的隣人買了東西慢慢的歸去。天黑了，屋裏的爐火加倍的旺，我坐在燈下，看看囂俄的長篇小說，忽然一個韶秀的人影飄然的落在我的身邊，她靜靜的不說一句話，好久才從一句書本上的話談到我們的過去，她不加考慮的把一切高興和悲哀的事情都說出來，因爲時間較久，高興與悲哀都失了激刺，所以感覺到的只是一片溫柔。</p>
<p>夜深了，煤油燈罩上添了一層薄暈，我們的談話，就從過去轉向了現在，自然共同的，——對於現在的滿足！</p>
<h3>初雪（續）</h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>「餓死，像你這種懶惰東西不餓死等幾時」？</p>
<p>「你不餓死，看你，你勤儉才不配餓死……」</p>
<p>「倒像是人說的話，討了女人，生了孩子，打算不養家嗎」？</p>
<p>「這樣的時勢自顧自還不能够，有什麼兒子女人……」</p>
<p>「你爲什麼不早打主意，要現什麼世，來害我們呢」？</p>
<p>「……三寳不再回答，只默默地走釗房裏去躺了；祇有那個孩子仍舊在他媽身邊哭嚷……</p>
<p>三寳娘子這時心裹已經塡滿了一腔悲憤與哀愁，看看孩子，望望天，雖然有眼淚也哭不出來，一顆心却比刀剜還要難過。</p>
<p>雪依然在繼續飄着，而且不時會從灶脚邊的破牕隙裏飛進幾片雪花來，溶消在沒有熱氣的鑊蓋上；地上屋上却已積下了一厚層。</p>

<p>邢瑞亭釵頭鳳</p>
<p>惠靈（一三八〇）下午九時至十時</p>
<p>開篇「愛情」</p>
<p>社會現今講愛情。摩登男女更紛紛。情書暗暗投遞送。妹妹哥哥纏不淸。說什麼。一見花容神志亂。忘餐廢寢失晨昏。請慈悲妹妹垂隣我，得償夙願訂三生，女兒家一見墜共術。只道是。男千多情喜不勝。意志不堅遭誘惑。同心蒂　訂鴛盟。園林同步多恩愛。影戲院中出入頻。有意相邀吃大菜。暗開旅館兩心傾。情投意合如膠漆。恨不兩身拚一身。那曉男兒眞薄倖。朝秦暮楚却無情。棄如倣屣掉頭去。又去授書想別人。女子含寃無可訴。祇能暗泣又呑聲。還有。毒心拆百年輕子。口蜜腹劍起邪心。騙你錢。汚你身。更皎薄倖邊三分。當初海誓山盟語。完全一片假懂惺。所以是。戀愛無非盡是假。一朝熱度化爲冰。有什麼愛有什麼情。前世寃家今世遇。可嘆芸蕓彼衆生。總之是。　海況沉多怨鬼。金錢　力愛情輕。倘得金錢來調濟。愛情穩妥不離分。所以是。金錢萬惡情塲險。情海茫茫可殺人。愛情還是化靈魂。</p>

<p>電影消息</p>
<h3>林楚楚與「慈母曲」</h3>
<p>只要是注意聯華新片攝製消息的，一定特別注意「慈母曲」，因爲這部片是三年來聯華男女明星最新的一次大會串。大家從片名可以知道，這是一部倫理劇，當然，這個慈母的角色在聯華的演員隊中是非林楚楚莫屬，林楚楚有着多年的銀幕經騐，老練的演技，在「國風」獲得極高的評價，是人人知道的，在「天倫」更是好得很。但我們可以武斷地說一句：這「慈母曲」可稱是她的藝術的最高表現呢。</p>
<h3>談「凱歌」的攝影與收音</h3>
<p>「凱歌」的攝影師是吳蔚雲，過去如「中國海的怒潮」「逃亡」等已有目共賞，母庸贅述。不過，他平素對於攝影的技術很肯用心研究，對於調色片的運用又十分靈巧，因此在「凱歌」中，不僅美滿地把大旱的特徵拍攝出來，同時，一個鏡頭者極盡美奐美輪，優美靈活。並且有時候，須將鏡架放在汚水的田中，他能毫無難色地，親自調度工作，等到鏡頭拍好，雖然兩隻腿已被馬蝗釘得血跡斑斑，但他尙能神氣自如，若無其事，所以說，他不但是一個優秀的攝影人員，同是更是一個忠於工作的藝術家。</p>
<p>「凱歌」的收音師是顧宗義，他知道「凱歌」不但是對白的聲片，對於音響尤屬重要，所以無論是蟬叫聲，虫鳴聲，鴉啼聲，乃至其他一切微妙聲音，都事先經過一番的探討和研究，因此成績優美，充分地表現出聲片的特點並音響的效果。</p>
<h3>「春色」兩卷一期出版</h3>
<p>上海卡德路一五三弄四號千秋出版社出版之春色，兩卷一期已准期出版，三色版歌星徐粲鶯裸影封面，銅圖有黎莉莉黎灼灼江曼莉等，照片漫畫有張白鷺之唐詩漫書，江毓祺金劍凡等漫畫，每冊只售八分，預定全年連郵國幣二元，贈芷芬女史扇面一頁，可加上欵，不取分文云。</p>

<h3>Song Zheyuan Receives Tada; Hopeful Signs in Negotiations on the Hebei-Chahar Issue; Resolution Plan to be Carried to Changchun by Doihara; Joint Discussion in Beiping Soon; Japan's Expansion of North China Garrison to be Realized Within Six Months; Song to Assume Office as Pacification Commissioner and Hebei Chairman on the 5th</h3>
<p>Tianjin: Song Zheyuan hosted a gathering at his private residence in the British concession of Tianjin, inviting over twenty key figures from the Japanese army and navy, including Tada, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin; Nagami, the chief of staff; Sakai, the former chief of staff of the garrison army; Ishii, Nakai, and Dogaki, staff officers; Kayashima, a company commander; Otake, an adjutant; and Kubo, a naval captain and director of the Tianjin office. The purpose was to foster camaraderie. The expansion of the Japanese army in North China is planned to be realized by the end of June next year at the latest. According to the Japanese military, the increase in troops is based on Articles 7 and 9 of the Boxer Protocol, which do not limit the number of soldiers. Therefore, other countries will have no excuse to object to the expansion based on the treaty. However, due to national finances and other factors, the garrison army headquarters hopes for a strong force, but it will be limited to stationing a mixed brigade and an air squadron of nine to twelve aircraft. Currently, the barracks at Haiguang Temple in the Tianjin concession and the Nandasi barracks in Qinhuangdao are being expanded to prepare for the arrival of new troops. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Regarding the Hebei-East Chahar issue, Song and others have been negotiating with the Japanese authorities for days since arriving in Tianjin, and there are considerable signs of progress. Currently, Qin Decun and Xiao Zhenying are continuing their efforts in the negotiations. According to sources, Doihara, the representative of the Japanese Kwantung Army, returning to Changchun from Tianjin has no impact on the negotiations with Hebei-East. The negotiating counterpart this time is Tada Shun, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin. Tada and Song have been exchanging visits for days. Last night, Tada hosted Song at the Zhangyuan headquarters, and tonight Song will also host a banquet at his private residence in the British concession to strengthen ties. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Song Zheyuan, Qin Decun, and Xiao Zhenying are scheduled to return to Beiping on the 30th or 31st. A military parade will be held on New Year's Day.

The negotiations on the three items of Hebei-East, Chahar-East, and Tanggu are currently not being handled. A solution was jointly discussed by Tada, the commander of the Japanese garrison in Tianjin; Nagami, the chief of staff; and Qin Decun, Xiao Zhenying, and Chen Juesheng. Doihara will take a plan to Changchun, and a decision can only be made after the Kwantung Army staff thoroughly discuss it in a meeting. Doihara is expected to return to Tianjin around the 5th to meet again. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: The Hebei issue is expected to improve in the near future after negotiations by the authorities in Tianjin. Doihara's mission to Changchun, in addition to reporting on his stay in Tianjin and Beiping, also includes seeking instructions on the Hebei-East issue. Doihara will return to Tianjin the day after tomorrow, and negotiations are scheduled to continue in Beiping after January 4th next year. The Chahar-North issue will also be discussed jointly at that time. As for the Tanggu issue, it is part of the Hebei-East issue.

<p>Tianjin: At 9:05 a.m. on the 29th, Lei Sishang, the director of the Beiping Social Affairs Bureau, left Tianjin and returned to Beiping. (29th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>After Lei Sishang arrived in Beiping from Tianjin on the afternoon of the 29th, reporters visited him to inquire about his trip to Tianjin to meet with Song Zheyuan. According to him, the Chinese and Japanese sides had several contacts in Tianjin regarding the Hebei-East and Chahar-East issues. Both sides are willing to resolve them simultaneously, but the Japanese side attaches more importance to Chahar-East. Therefore, Doihara made a special trip to Changchun to seek instructions on everything. Before Doihara returns to Tianjin, Tada will temporarily negotiate directly with Song Zheyuan. The current progress is quite smooth, and it is expected that it can be resolved after Doihara returns to Tianjin. Song, Qin, and Xiao are scheduled to return to Beiping on the evening of the 30th or the morning of the 31st. (29th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: Lieutenant General Doihara is about to return to Changchun. Only after his return to Tianjin can there be new developments in the negotiations between China and Japan regarding Hebei-East and Chahar-East. According to Chinese sources in Tianjin, Xiao Zhenying, the mayor of Tianjin, accompanied Doihara, the purpose of which is to meet with the authorities of the Kwantung Army to discuss the issues of Hebei-East and Chahar-East. According to another source, the Japanese military defense office in Fanzhi may be moved to Tianjin to facilitate its negotiations with China, and Doihara may be appointed commander of the Japanese army in North China to replace Tada. The Chinese here feel that since the six counties of Chahar-East have been occupied by the "Manchu" army, there is little hope of recovering them. As for the Hebei-East issue, it is doubtful whether we can resolve it immediately without further damage to Chinese sovereignty. (29th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Beiping: A cable from Chinese who have naturalized in "Manchukuo" states that the "Manchu" army occupying the six counties of Chahar-East is continuing its activities and may invade Suiyuan-East.

<p>Current Affairs Commentary</p>
<h3>Today's Educators</h3>
<p>— Bing</p>
<p>Since the rise of the student national salvation movement, the responses of local authorities have generally been measured, taking into account both reason and sentiment, without resorting to bias or extremism, sometimes expressing sympathy or offering sincere advice. Where some localities have taken regrettable measures, it has often been due to the limited vision of lower-level officials carrying out orders. Once explanations are provided, the disputes are quickly resolved. At this time, those who feel most distressed and are racking their brains are probably none other than the educators in charge of school affairs. Today, among school principals and professors, those who rose to prominence through student movements are too numerous to count. In their youth, they shouted in the streets and raised their arms in meeting places with a heroic spirit that they not only have not forgotten themselves, but which others still vividly recall. For such people to now accuse today's students of reckless actions, going beyond their bounds, and straying from their course is tantamount to "repenting of their youthful works," fundamentally denying their past. Those who bear a sense of responsibility for their actions would never do this. Some might say that today's circumstances are different from the past: the rulers of the past were warlords, dim-witted and senile, so it was right to launch student movements to awaken them; but now there is a revolutionary government at the top, so student movements are useless appendages. This statement sounds like the kind of argument one finds in humorous publications, and those who usually adopt a serious and upright attitude in their pronouncements would never want to utter it. However, considering the facts, adhering to reason, and weighing one's position, one is compelled to advise students against participating in movements. Therefore, they write documents, give talks, and speak in a roundabout way, full of heartfelt concern, praising the students' enthusiasm but regretting that national salvation work should not be done in such a simplistic manner. Even the most immature students understand this principle; their perseverance stems from a desire not just to hear empty words, but to grasp concrete evidence that they can rely on to pursue their studies with peace of mind. Yet the earnest advice of educators still does not go beyond the principles that students already know well. Educators claim that their patriotism is no less than that of the students, but students might jokingly label the educators as "tailists." Recently, some localities have brought forward the holidays, but when the holiday period ends, schools must reopen. If the objective factors of the student movement still exist, the educators' dilemma will inevitably recur. A few principals, feeling the difficulty of handling the situation, have even resigned. From a personal point of view, this is a simple solution, but considering the educator's duty, such weakness and retreat are inappropriate. Moreover, the nature of student movements is fundamentally different from that of unreasonable student unrest.</p>
<p>We believe that today, if educators want to dispel their distress, they should not resort to the kind of old-womanish "tailism," nor to inadequate measures, nor to the passive expression of weakness and retreat. Instead, they should examine themselves, thoroughly renew themselves, and establish a firm footing in education. Educators should be one with the students. If there is a distinction between "you" and "us," it must be removed. Educators should have an independent and unyielding personality. If they see themselves merely as tools for conveying orders, this must be changed. It has been said that professors who take a cynical view tell students, "We come for our salaries, you come for your grades; we each get what we need, and we have nothing to do with each other." It has also been said that a seemingly upright principal encourages students to focus on their studies, citing the example of foreign universities during the European war, where teachers and students continued to study diligently in the classroom even when cannons were firing in the suburbs and planes were flying in the sky. These two statements seem to differ in their laxity and strictness, but both fail to hit the mark. The first statement regards education as nothing, and the school as a marketplace; it is clear to all that such a person is not an educator. The second statement, at first hearing, makes everyone solemn, but those who make this statement have also considered the spirit of the teachers and students in the foreign universities who study diligently. Those teachers have lifelong specialties that they devote themselves to; to force them to abandon their research would be more painful than taking their lives. The students have the quality of learning with tireless enjoyment and are unwilling to close their books and leave even in the face of danger. If this kind of spirit is not instilled in them, then teachers and students will rush out of the school gate as soon as they see a notice of a holiday, let alone wait for cannons and planes. Therefore, this statement is also close to empty talk and is not the true color of an educator. Alas, the national crisis is serious and the danger of destruction is imminent. If educators want to devote their strength to this, they should focus on their duties and be educators of true color. Decadent ideas should not be allowed to exist, empty talk should not be uttered, they should be one with the students, not take a "tailist" approach, but lead them with a personality that is both impressive and responsive. If the educational circles of Beiping issued a declaration against the autonomy of North China and the teachers in various places opposed the deletion and revision of textbooks, this is enough to express this spirit. May this spirit spread throughout the national education circles and converge into a huge and strong force. If this is the case, not only will the handling of student movements not be so distressing, but it will also greatly benefit the great cause of our nation's struggle for survival.</p>

<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Law noted that in recent years, although a considerable number of probation sentences have been pronounced by courts at all levels, the level of leniency implementation is still far from satisfactory. On the 29th, it issued a general order to all courts that probationers who are placed under protective supervision should be given admonitions by protective supervisors at any time. Those not placed under protective supervision should be given admonitions by the judicial officers pronouncing the probation at the time of the probation declaration, encouraging them to turn over a new leaf.

<h3>National Assembly Discusses Diplomacy; French Cabinet Achieves Two Important Victories; Laval's Policy Passes Vote of Confidence; Upholding Covenant of League of Nations and Seeking Peace; Close Ties Maintained Between Britain and France</h3>
<p>Paris: The government achieved a double victory in the Chamber of Deputies last night. After two days of debate on diplomacy, the opposition party proposed a vote of no confidence, which was defeated by 404 votes to 261. Before the vote, Prime Minister Laval delivered a speech stating that France's policy is still based on the League of Nations, and the relationship between France and Britain remains as close as before. Laval reiterated his belief that the cooperation between France and Britain is necessary not only for the security of France but also for the peace of Europe. The motion of no confidence proposed by the opposition party deeply regretted that the government had not shown the world a clearer impression of faithfully adhering to France's consistent policy since 1919. The motion was rejected by 296 votes to 276. Subsequently, the Central Party's Chappetelen proposed a vote of confidence in the government, saying that the government must respect the League of Nations covenant on the one hand and seek peace on the other. When Laval stood up to speak and conclude the debate at 4:10 pm, the atmosphere in the chamber was very tense. Laval said that he had always been determined to answer all criticisms and announce all facts. His actions still adhered to the League of Nations covenant to fulfill France's obligations to the League of Nations. He had previously made a declaration in Geneva that France still fully supports the League of Nations, the French government is still based on the League of Nations, and France advocates open cooperation with all nations. His conscience is very open. He has not endangered the relationship between France and Britain. When the oil embargo against Italy is implemented in the future, he intends to consult with the Chamber of Deputies. Before the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian War, he had long been engaged in mediation efforts. On September 10th, he began talks with former British Foreign Secretary Hoare and British Minister Without Portfolio for League of Nations Affairs Eden. At that time, everyone thought that the first step in mediation efforts had failed, so they discussed how to continue their efforts. He has been working closely with the British authorities. They had agreed on sanctions against Italy and decided not to implement sanctions that would cause naval blockade or closure of the Suez Canal. Laval then detailed his efforts to seek a basis for reconciliation, saying that he admitted that the peace plan drafted with Hoare had failed in the British House of Commons and the League of Nations, but he would never be discouraged by this. As for the oil embargo issue, the British House of Commons did not understand France's loyalty to the League of Nations. The oil embargo must be approved by the US government to be effective, and the US government's support must be passed by Congress convened after January 15th next year. Laval finally mentioned the technical details of mutual assistance inquired by Britain, saying, "Some people ask me to give Britain a guarantee from France, but I am not very enthusiastic. I now accept this insult as an individual, not as France." Before Laval finished his speech and concluded the debate, the Radical Socialist Party and the Central Republican Party had convened meetings to discuss whether to support the government. The leader of the Central Republican Party, Reynaud, had resigned from the party because someone criticized his speech on Friday, but his resignation was rejected. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Rome Expresses Gratification; Awaits Future Actions of Britain and France</h3>
<p>Rome: Regarding the current French foreign policy, after Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval won a victory in the Chamber of Deputies, this question is expressed with satisfaction, and the news is published with large-character headlines. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Rome: Yesterday, French Prime Minister Laval won a victory in the Chamber of Deputies, which was heard with great joy here. British Ambassador Drummond has left for London today for vacation. It is expected that there will be no development in the overall situation before the League of Nations Executive Council meets on January 20th next year. It is believed that the oil embargo is no longer a problem, so the situation is not as tense as it was a few days ago. The Italian government is now quietly waiting for the movements in London and Paris. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>London: Foreign Secretary Eden is now resting in Yorkshire and is scheduled to return to Beijing to work on January 1st next year. Sir Drummond, the ambassador to Italy, has recently returned to his country and will pay a visit to the Foreign Secretary for consultation at that time. However, as far as the general public knows, Sir Drummond's decision to return to his country is for vacation purposes and not a recall to submit an oral report to the Foreign Secretary. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Rome: After the French Chamber of Deputies expressed confidence in the cabinet's foreign policy yesterday, the official circles here believed that the majority of French people still support the mediation policy on the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, which can be seen from this move. It is also within expectations that other important member states of the League of Nations will follow in France's footsteps. Regarding this, although the governments of these countries have not put forward any new suggestions since the peace solution proposed by French Prime Minister Laval and former British Foreign Secretary Hoare was aborted, the official circles here firmly believe that the future work of the League of Nations will not be limited to tightening sanctions (such as the implementation of an oil embargo), and a new attempt to resolve the situation peacefully will occur again one day. According to a reporter from this agency, the Vatican is also eager to continue its efforts for peace. Pope Pius XI, on the eve of Christmas yesterday, commented on the failure of the peace plan between Britain and France, saying that the main virtue of Christianity is to maintain hope. In addition, Cardinal Lorenzo also declared yesterday, "The dead can be resurrected," implying that mediation work will continue one day and there is no need to be disappointed.

<h3>French Radical Socialist Party Supports Government; Avoids Triggering Political Upheaval; Differences Among Cabinet Members Completely Eliminated</h3>
<p>Paris: When the Chamber of Deputies voted on the motion of confidence in the government, all members of the left wing of the Radical Socialist Party voted against it. Other members of the party voted in favor of it and issued a declaration explaining the reasons for this move, saying that the budget bill and the bill to ban military-style organizations have not yet been completely passed at this moment, and they are unwilling to cause a political upheaval and bear the responsibility for it. They are also very satisfied with Prime Minister Laval's declaration on foreign policy. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Paris: Laval's speech in the Chamber of Deputies yesterday was well received and was probably the best one since he attended the Chamber of Deputies. Observers commented on the results of the diplomatic debate, saying that Laval is now openly pursuing a policy of British-French mutual assistance. At the same time, Laval has defeated the conservatives in the Chamber of Deputies with a policy of cooperation with the League of Nations. Laval has now decided to make the Chamber of Deputies bear the responsibility for whether France should implement an oil embargo. Laval has eliminated the differences between him and Herriot and other Radical Party cabinet members, and the cabinet is now in a stable position. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>French Chamber of Deputies Announces; Bill to Ban Armed Associations</h3>
<p>Paris: Last night, after the important diplomatic debate was completed, the Chamber of Deputies passed the bill to prohibit the establishment of armed associations by 433 votes to 104. The Chamber of Deputies also passed the full text of the bill to prohibit people from carrying weapons, which had been passed by the Senate, and also passed the revised text of the plan on freedom of speech in newspapers. The case will be sent back to the Senate. The Chamber of Deputies adjourned at 11:50 p.m. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Paris: After the Chamber of Deputies expressed confidence in the cabinet's foreign policy, it adjourned at 7:00 p.m. in the evening and resumed the meeting at 9:00 p.m. The bill to ban political groups of a military nature, which had been passed by the Senate, was brought up for discussion. According to this bill, which was previously passed by the Chamber of Deputies, it advocates three points: 1. The Minister of the Interior has the power to dissolve military-style groups that endanger the security of the political system. 2. Those who illegally possess weapons will be severely punished. 3. Those who publish radical remarks in newspapers aimed at inciting murder, even if they do not have any effect, the person in charge can still be brought to court for punishment. The Senate passed the original proposal for the second and third points. For the first point, the Minister of the Interior was allowed to dissolve, and the revision was that the State Council could decide to dissolve it. What the Chamber of Deputies is discussing at this time is this amendment. (Havas dispatch on the 28th) Budget Bill Passed by Senate</p>
<p>Paris: The Senate passed the government's proposed full budget for the coming year by 268 votes to 17. The expenditure part totals 40,376,316,643 francs, and the income part totals 40,431,202,266 francs. After offsetting the income and expenditure, there is still a surplus of 54,885,623 francs. (According to this budget bill, which was previously passed by the Chamber of Deputies on the 19th of this month, the figures are slightly different from those passed by the Senate. The expenditure part in the Chamber of Deputies' proposal: 40,431,074,000 francs, and the income part totals 40,534,052,000 francs. After offsetting the income and expenditure, there is still a surplus of 102,978,000 francs.) (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Ethiopian Army Divides into Three Routes; Surrounding the City of Mek'ele; Southern Route Also Prepares to Take the Offensive</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: The government and the public were elated to hear the news that the Ethiopian army on the northern route had recovered the important town of Addi Abbi in the Denbian region and won other victories. It was reported that the Ethiopian army had captured about twelve tanks and forty to fifty machine guns, and captured two hundred enemies. In the battle to recover Addi Abbi, twenty-five bodies of Italian officers were found after the war, as well as hundreds of bodies of soldiers. Mek'ele has not yet been recovered, but the Ethiopian army is now carrying out a large-scale encirclement operation in three routes. One is the army commanded by Sebhat Hat, which attacks from the north, one is the army commanded by Gasa, which attacks from the south, and one is the army commanded by Siyoum, which attacks from the west. The three are the most trusted leaders of the Ethiopian Emperor. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The line-up of the Ethiopian army on the northern route is learned by the reporter of this agency as follows: On the left wing, General Haylu Kebede, whose headquarters is located in Antelasi, Hilae Mountain, will advance towards the holy city of Aksum within days. The middle-left wing is presided over by General Seyoum, the governor of Tigray Province. No news has been received for many days, only that the army is expected to advance towards the city of Adwa. The middle-right wing is commanded by General Gasa, who is advancing towards the city of Mek'ele from the south. The extreme-right wing is undertaken by General Sad, whose troops are currently active in the Emba Aradam area east of the city of Mek'ele. The eastern Weressa front line and the southern Wogga Eden front line are peaceful and uneventful. The Italian troops on each route have retreated to the positions they occupied at the beginning of the war. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Rome: Yesterday's communique issued by this agency did not mention the Ethiopian army's recovery of the city of Addi Abbi, only that a large team of Eritrean soldiers won a victory there on December 22. The communique also mentioned that Italian soldiers fought with the enemy in the mountain pass west of Afgā and that Italian aircraft bombed the Tagaze River and Amba Aradam. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: This agency's reporter Ochanate reports that the Italian army in the Hilae area on the northern route was recently defeated by the Ethiopian army and has retreated from Antelasi, setting fire to many local churches beforehand. Italian military aircraft are currently flying reconnaissance missions in the Amba Aradam area. (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Harar: On the 26th of this month, an Italian aircraft was forced to land near Daggah Bur on the southern route and was captured by the Ethiopian army. A traveler came here from Jijiga and recounted the situation at that time, saying that the aircraft ran out of gasoline and had no choice but to land six kilometers away from Daggah Bur. It was spotted by the Ethiopian army, who shot and killed the pilot and detained the aircraft. The other two people in the aircraft escaped in the meantime and were also captured by the Ethiopian army the next morning. Until the 27th, several Italian aircraft flew to the Daggah Bur and Jijiga areas to search for the missing aircraft. The local residents thought that these aircraft would carry out bombing and were very frightened. The aircraft then flew back to the front line and had no other actions. In addition, according to the traveler, the Wogga Eden front line on the southern route is currently very peaceful. It is generally believed that the Ethiopian army in that area will take the offensive sooner or later. Many soldiers of the Italian Somaliland army have surrendered to the Ethiopian army. Since the beginning of the war in the Wogga Eden area on the southern route, a total of fifteen soldiers of the headquarters and six hundred soldiers of the Somaliland army have been killed in action.

<p>Addis Ababa: The past week of Christmas has seen the most intense fighting since the beginning of the Italian-Ethiopian War. It is now believed that the fighting will be even more intense next week. As a result of the fighting on the northern route, thousands of wounded warriors are lying on the battlefield, groaning and waiting to die, with no one to rescue them. It is truly a tragedy. According to Taixi Lai, the British Red Cross rescue team arrived safely there yesterday after a very dangerous journey. The team plans to go to the front line immediately to set up a temporary dressing station. According to a doctor in the team yesterday, we can treat the wounded soldiers before the New Year.

<h3>Ethiopian Emperor Issues Proclamation to the Nation</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Emperor recently took the opportunity of Coptic Christmas to issue a proclamation to the nation, which reads, "Although we will encounter more hardships in the future, we will surely receive the help of God. The poor soldiers who shed their blood on the battlefield to defend the motherland will surely be protected by God. Our 'Lion of Judah' nation will also achieve final victory. You should all pray for loyal and brave soldiers, 'so that they can bravely kill the enemy and win the victory in one fell swoop.'" This agency's special correspondent Ochanate cabled that after the Emperor's proclamation to the nation was sent here from Taixi City, the residents in the city gathered in churches to pray together for the Ethiopian army to win a quick victory. In addition, the Taixi City Church was bombed and destroyed by the Italian Air Force. The Emperor recently ordered the Bulgarian architect Tel to repair it. (Havas dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Aircraft Throw Bombs into Volcano Crater; Failure to Change Direction of Molten Stone Flow</h3>

The molten stone is still flowing downward as usual. The aircraft dropped thirty tons of bombs and bombed the center point of the volcano. One stream of molten stone has now advanced to within three miles of the Hilo reservoir. (Reuters dispatch on the 29th)</p>
<h3>Mexican Finance Minister Fang Mei; Discusses Silver Issues; Falling Silver Prices Affect Mexican Economy; Only Two Ways to Cope with the Crisis</h3>
<p>Washington: According to news here today, Mexican Finance Minister Suarez has arrived here by plane and plans to discuss silver issues with Finance Minister Morgenthau on Monday. (National News dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<p>Mexico City: The Mining and Financial Magazine, in view of the recent continuous decline in silver prices, is deeply concerned that if this continues, it will have an adverse impact on the Mexican silver mining industry. Therefore, it has inquired about the situation from people familiar with the silver mining industry. It is said that if the ore mined by the national silver mining industry contains an average of more than 550 grams of pure silver per ton, then even if the silver price falls a few more points than the market price of 60.025 cents per ounce, it can still be barely supported. However, if the silver price falls sharply and continues to fall, then the industry can only follow two ways: one is to limit the mining of ore with a higher silver content to increase income, and the other is to find ways to reduce wages, freight, donations, taxes, etc. to reduce costs. Without these two methods, the industry will not be able to support the crisis caused by the collapse of silver prices. As for the amount of silver produced in Mexico, according to the Ministry of Economy's October bulletin, although silver prices have been rising in recent years (silver prices only fell until recently after the United States stopped buying silver in London. Before that, silver prices had been trending upward due to the US government's silver purchase policy), the total amount of silver produced in the country is not much different from previous years. For example, the output in January last year was 194,000 kilograms, and the output in October of the same year was 212,000 kilograms. The difference is not very large. It can be seen that rising silver prices are not enough to increase the total amount of silver produced. Only some mines with lower silver content that were abandoned and not mined in the past have now been reopened for profit, and the higher-content ore veins are all controlled to ensure that the land is not exhausted and reserved for future use. This is the impact of rising silver prices. Moreover, since silver prices rose, the government has levied a surplus tax on silver mining operators. Recently, various mine owners have submitted memos to the government, claiming that the tax rate is too high and businesses cannot bear it, and requesting a reduction. However, the amount of tax revenue is not small and is of great benefit to national finances. Moreover, after silver prices rose, the general economy in the country has improved, and the government's various financial revenues have also increased accordingly. As a result, the budget situation has greatly improved. For example, the 1932 budget had a deficit of 28,000,000 pesos (the name of the Mexican currency). By the 1934 budget, the income and expenditure were offset, and there was a net surplus of 40,000,000 pesos. This is all due to the high silver prices. After the government obtained this huge amount of funds, it was able to make many achievements in public utilities. Recently, it was also passed by Congress to increase the salaries of 38,000 civil servants across the country, all those with monthly salaries below 200 pesos, by 5%. In the future, it is said that there is still hope for continued salary increases. From this point of view, if silver prices gradually fall, the impact will not only be a serious blow to Mexico's general economy, but also shake the national budget. Regarding this, the famous economist Marellos Chaiaragoza once published an article, saying, "Since the United States has become the only buyer of silver coins, silver has no longer been a commodity for industrial use or coin minting, but has been transformed into a weapon with coercive power. All countries that maintain the national economic balance by the silver production industry, especially countries like Mexico, can be controlled by this weapon at any time. As a result, we will inevitably be forced to directly become a vassal of this northern neighbor (referring to the United States)." (Havas dispatch on the 28th)</p>
<h3>World Colonial Markets; All Countries Should Enjoy Equal Rights; US Deputy Secretary of State Advocates; "Economic Disarmament"</h3>
<p>Cheng: Deputy Secretary of State Cell said today in a speech to Democratic Party women members that he advocated "economic disarmament." If trade is not smooth, then the army will cross the border. He also said that all countries should have complete and equal rights to enter the world's colonial markets for trade. The view of developing colonies as the tail end of surplus population is an absurd talk. If the living standards of the surplus population are not reduced, then the solution is not to immigrate out of the country, but to enable them to enter various markets for trade.

<h3>Uruguay Severs Ties with Russia; Expels Diplomatic Representatives; Accuses of Inciting Revolution; Russian Ambassador's Protest Rejected</h3>

<p>Washington: Informed sources said today that Uruguay's severance of relations with Russia has made it impossible for Moscow to expand its political influence in the Western Hemisphere. Among the democratic countries in Latin America, Uruguay has maintained diplomatic relations with Russia for the longest time. Therefore, the capital of Uruguay has been regarded as the center of Soviet Russian power and the main place for Soviet Russian commercial contact with South America.

<h3>Sugar Production Quota Allocation for Areas Outside the US Mainland</h3>
<p>Washington: Agriculture Secretary Wallace today formulated the sugar production quota for areas outside the US mainland in 1936 under the Constington and Jones Act, totaling 4,624,000 short tons (2,000 pounds per ton). The quota for 1935 was 4,549,000 short tons. The allocation is as follows:</p>
<p>1936  Cuba 1,853,000 short tons Philippines 990,000 Puerto Rico 801,000 Hawaii 941,000 Virgin Islands 5,000 Tax-free countries 26,000</p>
<p>1935  Cuba 1,825,000 short tons Philippines 982,000 Puerto Rico 788,000 Hawaii 926,000 Virgin Islands 5,000 Tax-free countries 25,000</p>
<p>The case also stipulates that the basic sugar production quota for the US mainland in 1936 is 150,000 tons for beet sugar and 260,000 tons for cane sugar. The estimated US sugar consumption in 1936 is 6,434,000 tons. (Reuters dispatch on the 28th)</p>

<h3>New York Newspaper Correspondent Observes: Russo-Japanese Conflict Tends to Surface, Russia Builds New 7,000-Mile Railway in the West, Siberian Eastern Section is Laid with Double Tracks</h3>
<p>New York: A newspaper of the New York Scripps-Howard chain today published an article by Mr. Sins, stating that according to semi-official sources, two major forces, encompassing half of the world's population, are gradually heading towards conflict. Japan's actions in North China and Inner and Outer Mongolia, and contact with the Manchurian-Mongolian-Siberian border, are merely superficial disputes. Mr. Sins stated that the Japanese semi-official circles are deeply concerned about Russia's railway construction plan in the Far East, such as the 630 miles from Fort Nyudinsk to Kulun, the 1,250 miles from Baladinsky to Uriassutai, and three other shorter lines, all of which are extremely important militarily. Russia is also quite anxious about Japan's highway and railway construction plans in Manchuria and Jehol. Japan has pushed Russia's strategically important border back to Lake Baikal, 200 miles from the Pacific coast. If Kulun is further controlled, the Lake Baikal defense line will also be threatened by Japan. Once the Siberian Railway is interrupted at Lake Baikal, eastern Siberia will no longer be able to receive foreign aid. At that time, if Russia wants to take Japan, it can only break out from Russian Turkestan. Japan's efforts to create anti-Russian buffer states are also aimed at preventing danger in that area. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>According to the Moscow dispatch of the Observer, the double track of the Siberian Railway from Lake Baikal to Boly has now been completed, and the locomotive factory, repair shop, and warehouse have also been completed. Therefore, the new track is expected to open to traffic soon. Most of the road construction workers are criminals, including many women. Soviet Russia is now planning to build a new 7,000-mile railway from the Black Sea to the Pacific Ocean. Its plan is even greater than the Siberian Railway, and the various sections of the new road have been planned. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>Japan's War Preparations: Changtu and North Korean Railway Lines Completed, Japanese-Korean-Manchurian Military Transport Connected</h3>
<p>Tokyo: The Japanese military's work to connect the Japanese-Korean-"Manchurian"-North China military transport, which was planned to facilitate the transportation of troops from the Japanese mainland to Korea, Manchuria, and North China, has now been largely completed. That is, the railway line from Changchun to Tumen River (the extension of the old Jihui Line) has been completed, and the North Korean railway will soon be connected for through traffic. From now on, Japan's troop transport to "Manchuria" and North China no longer needs to land in Dalian, but can directly enter Manchuria through Korea and enter the pass via the Beining Road. The Japanese Army Department has decided to establish a new army transport detachment at Rajin Port in northern Korea in April next year, seeking to complete the military transport between Japan, Korea, Manchuria, and North China.

<h3>Japanese Telegram Propaganda: Russo-Mongolian Military Alliance</h3>
<p>The meeting held in Moscow between the Soviet Union and Outer Mongolia, which is a prerequisite for the conclusion of a military alliance between the two countries, has attracted attention from all parties. According to the Berlin Tagblatt, which reprinted the special telegram from the Peiping correspondent of the Daily Telegraph, the facts of the military cooperation between the two countries of Outer Mongolia have been clearly stated. Recently, the Soviet Union has carried out a major military mobilization in Outer Mongolia. Under the guidance of the Soviet Air Force commander, a division of the Outer Mongolian Red Army is stationed in the capital Ulaanbaatar, boasting its mechanical equipment, and several mechanized corps are stationed in the Manchurian-Mongolian border area. 200 Soviet aircraft will take joint action to complete the close military connection between the two major important cities of Moscow, Ulaanbaatar, and Khabarovsk. In addition, according to local reports in northern Manchuria, the Outer Mongolian army is recently moving its troops on the south bank of Lake Boi'er eastward. Since a certain task of the Soviet-Mongolian Allied Forces will become a reality, the "Manchurian"-Mongolian border area is shrouded in an atmosphere of anxiety. On the one hand, the Soviet Union vigorously advocates the rationality of its Moscow military conference, saying that preventing Japan's continental policy is to promote the realization of world peace, and it fabricates the news of the Japanese-German military alliance to stimulate the nerves of Britain and France, and wants to prevent Japan's anti-communist work in North China. The Soviet Union's major propaganda is to regard the progress of anti-communist work in North China as a thorn in its side, and it is using all kinds of tricks to try to hinder its progress, in order to advance the redification work in the East Asian continent. Its situation is indeed of great interest. (29th Japan United Press)</p>
<h3>Japanese-German Military Agreement: Japanese Army Attaché in Berlin Denies</h3>
<p>Berlin: The French Communist Party's newspaper "L'Humanité" reported that the Japanese Army Attaché at the Japanese Embassy in Germany had negotiated a military agreement with Ribbentrop, the German leader Hitler's special envoy for disarmament, to jointly deal with the Soviet Union. The Japanese here firmly denied this, saying that this statement was fabricated and laughable. The last time the Japanese Army Attaché met with Ribbentrop was at a German government banquet a year ago, at which all the army attachés of various countries participated. As for the so-called military agreement in "L'Humanité", according to common practice, it should be discussed by the ambassador and the foreign minister, and it is not something that the army attaché can handle on his own authority. Although Japan's policy of resisting the Third International is the same as Germany's views, there is currently no intention to conclude any agreement. At present, there is only one agreement between Japan and Germany, stipulating that both parties may send officers to practice in the other country's army, and there are no other military agreements.

<h3>All Provincial Mint Factories Have Stopped Minting</h3>
<p>Nanjing: The Ministry of Finance previously issued a notice to all provinces and cities in order to unify the currency policy, ordering all privately established mints within their jurisdictions, and those that privately opened and minted silver and copper coins in the original mints, to stop minting, and send the original molds to the Ministry for verification and destruction. It is now known that only Anhui, Hunan, Yunnan, Fujian, Shaanxi and other provinces have mints. The Anhui and Fujian mints had already stopped minting. The Hunan mint originally minted double copper coins. After it was closed in 1924, all factory sites and machines were transferred to the Hunan People's Livelihood Factory in 1928 and converted into a manufacturing industrial supplies organization. Yunnan minted half-opened silver coins, which can be gradually closed after the legal currency is circulated in Yunnan in the future. Shaanxi has stopped minting light silver coins and copper coins, and has submitted the coin molds to the Ministry. According to the Finance Standing Bureau, the secret minting of coin factories in various provinces has been basically eliminated. (29th Central News Agency Telegram)</p>

<h3>Lecture on Chinese Language and Literature: What to Write (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Ye Shaojun, Editor of Kaiming Bookstore</p>
<p>What I have said above is nothing more than to explain that the writing material should be within the scope of one's own experience. The aspects that you are currently starting to write about are all within this scope. As long as the attitude you hold is normal, you will naturally gain something from each time you write. I think you may ask: "The essay questions set by teachers may not be within the scope of our experience, right?" I can answer this way. Any wise Chinese language teacher will never set questions that exceed the scope of students' experience. When setting questions, they completely abandon their own subjective views and instead stand from the student's perspective to imagine what materials are students' experiences, what students can write, and what they want to write. After choosing, they then write their questions. In this way, although the questions are set by the teacher, from the student's perspective, it is the same as writing a letter or a travelogue, and it is still writing to express one's own experience. At the same time, you also get the benefit of practice. I know that there are many wise Chinese language teachers now. Based on their actual experience and usual research, they will never set some strange questions that are 108,000 miles away from the students' experience, causing students to scratch their heads and sigh: there is no meaning, no material. Of course, it is inevitable that some teachers are limited by habits and the environment, and the questions they set are not very suitable for students' tastes. For example, the "On Learning and Practicing It Regularly" that I have seen is an example. If I were a student, I would not understand how this question should discuss learning and practicing it regularly. Speaking of common sense, it is probably correct, so what else can be said besides saying that this statement is correct? This kind of question was often set in the former private schools, and similar questions are occasionally set in the current entrance examinations and public examinations. The teacher who set this question probably did so due to these two influences. If you encounter such a teacher, you can only sincerely ask him to say that learning how to write such questions now may only be a little useful when you encounter a public examination. In real life, there is simply no need to write such questions. Even if your teacher thinks that occasionally preparing for the old exam is necessary, can you let us write fewer such questions and more articles that express our own experiences? These words are very reasonable and are not an excessive request. As long as the words are reasonable, who would not want to listen? I think your teachers will definitely follow your wishes.</p>
<p>Furthermore, experiences have different depths, superficiality, accuracy, and errors. For example, if we walk down a street and roughly know that there are two or thirty stores on this street, this cannot but be regarded as experience. However, if we observe carefully and know which departments these two or thirty stores belong to, which one has the most abundant capital, and which one has the most developed business, then this kind of experience is much deeper than the previous experience. For example, when we were young, we saw a lunar eclipse, and our grandmother told us that this was the wild moon wanting to swallow the family moon into its belly. If we don't beat gongs and drums to save it, the family moon will really be eaten up. We heard it and remembered it in our hearts. This is our experience, but it is wrong. Later, we learned geography and understood the basics of planetary movement. We realized that there was no wild moon, let alone the matter of swallowing the family moon. It turned out that what obscured the moon was the shadow of the earth. This is an accurate experience, and the previous one was just two examples. In addition, we can draw inferences from this: When we pick up a pen to write, it is the same as when we open our mouths to speak. We always hope to write some deep and accurate experiences and don't want to fill a piece of paper with superficial and erroneous experiences. Otherwise, what is written is either boring or nonsense. This is taking the matter of writing too unseriously and violates the attitude we hold. In this way, it is not enough to just write our own experiences. We need to go a step further and refine our experiences before we can write without being arbitrary, in accordance with our writing attitude.</p>
<p>Refining the experience is not a matter of writing, nor is it just a matter of Chinese and other subjects, but it is a matter of our entire lives. We go to class every day, read books every day, work every day, and play games every day, always and everywhere making our experiences deeper and more accurate. We are not doing this just to write essays. We have to be useful people and healthy citizens, so we have to do this. At the same time, it also opens up a vivid source for writing. Drawing from this source, we can always get clear water. What we fear is that we are not willing to work hard in class, reading books without selection or method, and work and games are just casual and careless, perfunctory, and do not use our full energy to deal with them, just trying to get by. In this way, experience is difficult to achieve the realm of depth and accuracy. It is difficult for such people to do anything well, and they certainly cannot be called useful, and they certainly cannot be called healthy citizens. At the same time, his source of writing is dry. If he reluctantly goes to draw, what he draws is only half a glass of dirty water mixed with mud. Therefore, the source of writing material is pervasive throughout the entire life. The entire life is constantly developing upwards, and the writing material will naturally flow out endlessly and constantly, and it is always clear. Some people do not understand this principle and think that writing is just a matter of lying on the table and picking up a pen to work hard to improve. They do not pay attention to the refinement of their own experience. They have not thought that writing and their own experience are intertwined and inseparable. The result of this hard work may be that, due to technical proficiency, they can write some very decent and good articles like mirages. But this is just a useless toy, which is like a tumor in real life, so this kind of skilled technology is also a useless technology. I hope you will not make these people's mistakes and must remember that the source of writing material is pervasive throughout the entire life. Although you have to lie on the table when writing, refining writing material cannot be done simply by lying on the table. When leaving the writing table, in class, reading, working, and playing, you must be serious and diligent everywhere. On the one hand, people should do this, and on the other hand, it is also opening up the source of writing material. This is not a difficult thing, and a qualified secondary school student can do it. I hope you are all qualified secondary school students.</p>
<p>Now let's come to a conclusion. What to write? We must write our own experiences. Our own experiences must be deep and accurate. This requires effort throughout our entire lives to achieve our wish. With deep and accurate experiences, we do not have to worry about not having good material to write good articles. (End)</p>

<h3>Conflict Between Villagers and Police in Weiting Township</h3>
<p>Suzhou: Zhang Jianqing, a tax collector from Yangjiatian Village in Weiting Township, privately demolished a house and was torn down by the villagers. Today, the township district office held a meeting to discuss the training of tax collectors. The township head of Yangjiatian also attended. While they were discussing, they suddenly received a report that more than a thousand villagers had gathered and were going to the township. The patrol officer of the Fifth Police Station under the direct jurisdiction of the Public Security Bureau, after receiving the information, immediately dispatched a group of police officers and security team members to the township to be on guard. At this time, the villagers had already reached the bridge near the township. The police immediately fired shots into the air. The villagers in the back row immediately rushed forward. The villagers on the bridge could not stand their ground and rushed straight off the bridge. When Patrol Chief Lu Zhenjia saw this situation, he drew his pistol and fired into the crowd, injuring a villager named Gui Xichun on the spot. As a result, the villagers became even more angry and rushed to the Fifth Sub-Bureau, destroying the sub-bureau. The police were outnumbered and fled without a trace. Afterwards, the villagers went to the district office to petition and took control of the office's telephone. It was not until 8:30 PM that the county government learned of the matter from the Beijing-Shanghai Railway and sent a team to suppress the situation. The injured villagers were also sent to the Gengsheng Hospital in the city for treatment at 9:00 PM. (29th Special Telegram)</p>

<h3>Statement from the Fujian Construction Department: The Truth About Mineral Exploration in Anxi; Hiring Japanese Technicians Was Approved by the Central Government</h3>
<p>Xiamen Dispatch: The Construction Department of the Fujian Provincial Government organized the Anxi Iron Mine Exploration Engineering Office and appointed Zhao Xiujin as its director. Japanese technicians were hired to conduct mineral exploration and survey railways and harbors. Five Japanese technicians, including Ishida Sei, Soma Hideo, Otake Akira, Nakagawa Kikamatsu, and Isobe Tsunesugu, arrived in Xiamen. Zhao Xiujin also arrived on the 23rd from the provincial capital by land, accompanied by Lin Zhaojin, chief engineer of the Construction Department's Water Conservancy Engineering Office and deputy engineer of the Anxi Iron Mine Engineering Office, as well as water conservancy technician Chen Yingjie and railway technician Chen Zilong. After arriving in Xiamen, Zhao issued a written statement as follows: "The iron ore in Anxi is abundant. This year's construction policy of the provincial government focuses on agriculture and forestry, as well as the development of mineral resources, in addition to transportation. Therefore, the Construction Department sent personnel to conduct surveys in April of this year. At the same time, the provincial government sent a letter to the Geological Survey Institute in Beiping, requesting them to send personnel for on-site investigation. However, for the sake of research, we sought detailed information and consulted with the Japanese Consul General in Fuzhou, requesting the Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences to send personnel for investigation. All of the above were completed in May of this year. According to reports from all parties, the Construction Department found that the ore quality in the area is excellent, especially the iron sand in Pantian, which has a high iron content and very few impurities such as phosphorus, making it a rare and excellent iron ore. However, Pantian is located in the midst of mountains and steep peaks, and transportation is the biggest problem for development. Even if the ore quality is excellent, if the reserves are not economically viable for independent mining due to transportation conditions, it will have to be abandoned temporarily. The Construction Department, recognizing this, decided to conduct further investigation, implement exploratory drilling, and conduct quantitative surveys. At the same time, it is necessary to study transportation routes for planning purposes. Furthermore, the trial drilling work requires diamond drilling rigs, which are very expensive, so we plan to borrow from various parties. As for the personnel, we plan to hire foreign technicians with more experience to assist Chinese technicians in handling the work. We have also consulted and hired several Japanese technicians. The Construction Department has organized the Anxi Iron Mine Exploration Engineering Office to take charge of the matter. Currently, both Chinese and foreign technicians have set off and are working in shifts. It is estimated that the investigation and surveying of the railway terminus and harbors will be completed in about two to three months. The trial drilling work will take about ten months. In the future, if the investigation results indicate that it is economically viable for independent mining, then how everything should proceed will be decided by the central government. Therefore, the Construction Department was ordered to organize an engineering office and go to Anxi to work, entirely for technical research. Before the amount of ore and transportation issues are clear, it is premature to talk about whether the mine will be developed or how funds will be raised. Regarding renting machinery and hiring Japanese technicians, we also requested instructions from Chairman Chiang, the President of the Executive Yuan, and the ministers of the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Industries for special caution. After their approval, the provincial government's Councilor and Foreign Affairs Section Chief Chen Hongsheng arrived in Xiamen on the 22nd and also issued a statement, saying, 'In May of this year, regarding the issue of surveying Anxi mineral resources, a leaflet was discovered that was extremely suspicious of the provincial government and myself. After investigation, it was found to be a misunderstanding. Therefore, Director Chen (Ticheng) and myself both believe that it is necessary to publicly announce this matter to clarify it to the public. Today, Director Yang came to Xiamen and issued a written statement, which is the truth about this matter.' Furthermore, on the 23rd, the Mining Affairs Office of the Construction Department also issued a statement in the province, stating that renting machinery and hiring technicians for mineral exploration in Anxi were all approved by Chairman Chiang, President Wang, and the Ministry of Railways and the Ministry of Industries. Investigating railway routes and surveying harbors is part of planning for transportation issues. Whether the mine will be developed and how funds will be raised will also be decided by the central government. Mineral exploration requires expensive diamond drilling machines and instruments, so the Construction Department also leased them from the South Manchuria Railway Company. The Japanese technicians have brought them on the Kaizan Maru. In addition to mining specialists, there are also railway and harbor specialist engineers who are responsible for mineral exploration, surveying routes, and harbor work. According to Lin Zhaojin and Chen Yingjie, the work will be divided into four categories: minerals, trial drilling, railways, and harbors. Lin and Chen are only responsible for harbor work and will not enter Anxi, but will inspect Zhangping and Huaan. Director Zhao and Li Qishan are responsible for mineral exploration, and Chen Zilong is responsible for surveying routes. Each department has about four or five key personnel, all with Japanese technicians. Zhao plans to stay in Xiamen for a short time and then lead the seventeen Japanese technicians and Lin, Chen, Li, and others, a total of twenty-two people, to depart. The provincial government has also transferred a battalion from the Fifth Security Regiment to Anxi for protection. (December 25th)</p>

<h3>Austere Rural Life</h3>
<p>— Edited by Yu Qingtan</p>
<p>Impressions of Rural Women in the Chinese Loess Plateau Zhang Xichang</p>
<p>The Chinese Loess Plateau includes the entirety of Shandong, Hebei, and Shanxi, the northern parts of Jiangsu and Anhui, and the central and northern parts of Henan. In this vast region, due to the backwardness of agricultural production, the consciousness of the farmers is also stained with remnants of feudalism. This consciousness, as reflected in the lives of women, is manifested as being tightly bound by the "old etiquette", with women almost in the position of "domestic slaves," unseen by the world, without independent personalities, and without social status. In the backward Loess Plateau, the entire poor peasant class is living a "non-human" existence, especially in the areas where the colonization process has been intensified recently. The most unfortunate are naturally the vast peasant class; and the lives of rural women, veiled with "feudalism", are even more bleak.</p>
<p>In recent years, I have had several opportunities to travel in the rural areas of Hebei, Shandong, Henan, northern Jiangsu, and northern Anhui. I have gained some impressions of the lives of rural women in this region, which can only be said to be impressions. I would like to write them down as a reference for those who care about Chinese women's issues. Because what I am writing is "impressions," there will inevitably be differences in degree from the actual situation, but in general, they are not far from "reality."</p>
<p>A Joke The rural women in this area are most afraid of seeing people, especially strangers. They usually stay at home and do not go out easily. Sometimes, when sitting in front of the door, they see a stranger passing by and immediately turn to face the house, or even run inside. Therefore, when you travel in the countryside, you rarely see middle-aged women.</p>
<p>Once, a friend from the north told me a joke. One day, a farmer ran to a farmer's house. The farmer's husband had gone to the fields to "work," and only his wife was at home. The farmer knocked on the door from the outside and said, "Is anyone home?" "No one is home!" the woman's voice replied from inside. She did not go out to open the door. In fact, in their view, rural women do not consider themselves to be dignified people. This is no longer a joke.</p>
<p>No Female Students Can Be Found in Elementary Schools In Chinese rural areas, there are not many children going to school at all. Now, education is enjoyed by a few wealthy people, and the vast majority of children without money are refused entry to schools. And the few children who are fortunate enough to enjoy the "right to education" are mostly boys. Even if we look at the whole country, according to the statistics recently released by the Ministry of Education, boys account for 84.9 percent of children with elementary school education, while girls account for only 15.1 percent. In the Loess Plateau, where culture lags behind due to backward production, it is very difficult to find female students in rural elementary schools. Because of our investigation of the rural economy, we often live in villages, and elementary schools are our best accommodation. A large village with three or four hundred families has opened an elementary school with the support of all the villagers, but only a few children attend. We rarely see female students, so we ask them, "Why don't you send girls to school?" "Do girls need to go to school? We still have boys at home!" This is their perfectly reasonable answer.</p>
<p>"The Unbinding-Feet Inspectors Are Coming!"</p>
<p>Seven or eight years ago, women cutting their hair in the south was a problem. Now, no matter where you go, you will hardly find girls with braids. This cannot be denied as a kind of progress (although it is superficial). But in the rural areas of Shandong, Hebei, Henan and other provinces, their problem is not cutting their hair, but "foot-binding." Not only middle-aged women, but even girls of five, six, seven, and eight years old have their "natural feet" tightly bound. Once, when we were investigating in a village in Huixian County, northern Henan, many people shouted when we ran to a village, "The unbinding-feet inspectors are coming! The unbinding-feet inspectors are coming!" Many girls were so scared that they ran away.</p>
<p>It turns out that the district and township offices have listed "unbinding feet" as one of the main administrative tasks. Notices prohibiting foot-binding are posted in towns and large villages. Many district chiefs and township chiefs' wives have "set an example" and unbound their feet first. In Xuchang, Xiangxian and other places in Henan, the county government has an organization for the Foot Unbinding Committee, and the county magistrate's wife is a natural member. All women under the age of 30 must be inspected. Those who do not unbind their feet are fined one yuan. Seeing so many of us going to the countryside this time, they were naturally scared "out of their wits"!</p>
<p>Many rural women are unwilling to unbind their feet even if they die, because they cannot marry a husband if they unbind their feet. Therefore, they would rather pay a "foot-binding donation" of one yuan (this term is not invented by the author) than unbind their feet. But in this way, the peasants have another burden!</p>
<p>"Is She a Sister or a Mother?"</p>
<p>In the north, it is difficult to run into a farmer's home; even if you enter, it is not easy to see their mistress. Once, we walked into the home of a relatively open-minded young farmer and saw a woman much older than him. We asked, "Is she your sister or your mother?" The young farmer was asked until his "face turned red" and he smiled shyly. She turned out to be his wife.</p>
<p>Men usually marry early, and wives are usually older than their husbands. Men usually marry at the age of thirteen or fourteen, and women marry at the age of about twenty. Women are often five or six years older than men. Sometimes, the boy is really too young, and the wife has to take on the task of being a mother. We also heard a joke when we were investigating in Weixian County, Shandong. A farmer's child in a village was only nine years old, and he actually got married that year. One summer evening, the family was enjoying the cool in the courtyard, and the nine-year-old groom fell asleep in a deck chair. The others joked with the bride. Everyone hid, and the bride had no choice but to carry "him" to her room. Naturally, the people hiding there laughed secretly!</p>
<p>Northerners do not say "marry a wife" but say "marry a daughter-in-law", as if they are marrying a "daughter-in-law" for their parents rather than a "wife" for themselves. Indeed, it is so. In the parents' opinion, marrying a "daughter-in-law" for their son early can not only end a worry, but also have someone to take care of many chores in the family from then on. However, there must be a prerequisite, that is, having money on hand. In recent years, as a result of the rapid collapse of the rural economy, the number of middle-aged farmers who cannot afford to "marry a daughter-in-law" is also increasing every day!</p>
<p>A Difficulty for Female Students</p>
<p>In Hebei, Shandong, and northern Henan, female students with secondary education are truly "rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns." Their families are either landlords who collect rent and lend money in the countryside, or powerful and influential gentry. Since their "young ladies" have been sent to secondary schools to study, they will naturally not easily "promise" themselves to others. Last year, we lived in a coeducational normal school in a certain place in Shandong. According to several male students, female students in schools in the north have a difficulty. Because almost all male students have already married, their marriage problems are often difficult to solve. Because female normal school graduates cannot find male students as partners, they often marry bureaucrats and politicians with wealth and power at the behest of their families. Therefore, it is also difficult to find a female teacher in rural elementary schools, and the education of rural women is naturally unheard of.</p>
<p>A Special Dowry</p>
<p>The summer before last, we were in Neixiang, Henan. One evening, we were chatting with the district chiefs of various districts (because there was a district chief meeting the next day, so they had arrived in the city in advance) and talked about the custom of Henan people valuing men over women and the custom of women marrying. It is said that in the areas around Tanghe, Dengxian, and Nanzhao, where bandits often appear and disappear, when marrying a daughter, in addition to "compensating fields," they also have to "compensate guns" (both Mauser pistols and rifles). In this area, the custom of drowning baby girls is very prevalent, because families who cannot afford compensation have to sacrifice their daughters early. We had never heard of such a "special dowry" before, and we did not believe it at the time. Later, we heard the same legend elsewhere, and I thought it must be true.</p>
<p>Completely Separated from Agricultural Production</p>
<p>I think the most fundamental reason why rural women in the Yellow Plateau suffer from such unequal and cruel treatment is that they have been completely separated from agricultural production for thousands of years. Don't you see the rural women in Guangdong and Guangxi? They can transplant rice seedlings, they can carry loads, they can row boats, and they can do more labor than men. In the south, when it is busy farming, you can see groups of rural women "setting up rows" in the market (that is, female workers waiting to be hired lined up on the street), and you can see women singing while transplanting rice seedlings in the fields. But when you go to the north with a yellow land, except for a few poor rural women who have to do some light work in the fields, you will never find a woman working barefoot and in shorts with heavy farm tools in the fields. Because they are separated from agricultural labor and agricultural production, they have not been "dignified people" for thousands of years, and they will always be "useless" in the family and "slaves" of men. No wonder Mr. Yan Xishan of Shanxi, in his recently proposed but not yet implemented "land village public ownership" method, did not allocate "shared land" to women!</p>
<h3>Song Zheyuan Speaks in Tianjin: The Military, Political, and Diplomatic Affairs of Hebei and Chahar; Pacifying the Region and Suppressing Bandits Takes Priority; Maintaining Territorial Sovereignty Against External Forces</h3>
<p>Tianjin Dispatch: On the evening of the 25th at 6 o'clock, Song Zheyuan, accompanied by Chen Juesheng, Chief Councilor of the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters, Zhang Jianhou, Director of the 29th Army's Office in Beiping, and others, arrived in Tianjin from Beiping. Qin Dechun, Mayor of Beiping, and Xiao Zhenying, Mayor of Tianjin, both went to the station to welcome them. Li Sihao, former Minister of Finance of the former Northern Government, had been invited by Song to meet and talk in Beiping. That night, he took the same train with Song to pass through Tianjin without stopping and went south. Song got off the train at the East Station and returned to his residence at No. 131, 17th Road, British Concession. After a short rest, he returned to his mother's residence on Qiangzihe Road to visit his relatives, accompanied by Qin, Xiao, Chen, and others. At 7:00 p.m. and 11:30 p.m., Pan Yugui, Director of the Political Affairs Department of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee, Sun Longji, Director of the 29th Army's Office in Shanghai, and Wang Shijiu, Director of the Secretariat of the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters, came to Tianjin to pay their respects. Liu Jialuan, Chief of Staff of the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters, came to Tianjin in the morning to handle the takeover of the Tianjin-Goubao Security Command in accordance with Song's orders. All files were transferred to the custody of the Garrison Headquarters. Most of the lower-level employees of the Tianjin-Goubao Security Command were transferred from the 32nd Army, so they were given half a month's bonus and ordered by Shang Zhen to return to the Shunhe Military Headquarters to serve. Liu Jialuan, who handled the takeover, will have to stay in Tianjin for another two or three days. If there are any difficult matters, he will ask Song for instructions nearby. In addition to discussing and resolving the issues of Hebei East and Chahar East with the Japanese side, Song also intends to visit celebrities in Tianjin. Tufeiyuan, Chief of the Special Service Agency of the Japanese Army stationed in Shenyang, came to Tianjin from Beiping at 4:00 p.m. on the 25th to wait for Song. The Japanese side is responsible for the negotiations on the Hebei-Chahar incident, and the Chinese side is in contact with Qin and Xiao. On the afternoon of the 20th, Song's daughter and Fei Deyao's son were married. Both sides hosted relatives and friends at their residences in Tianjin. Jia Deyao also rushed back to Tianjin to hold the betrothal ceremony. The reporter visited Song at his private residence in the British Concession on the afternoon of the 26th and asked about various matters. According to Song, he will stay in Tianjin for about three or four days this time and return to Beiping before the New Year. A military parade will be held in Xiyuan on New Year's Day. It is scheduled to invite foreign envoys and guests stationed in Beiping on January 4th. The takeover of Baoding has been completed, so it does not matter when he goes there. If he goes, it will be after January 5th. The most urgent task to be carried out in Hebei Province is to appease the region and enable the people to live and work in peace. Recently, due to the mobilization of troops in various counties and towns, the defenses have been weakened, and bandits have taken the opportunity to rise up. There are bandits lurking in Renqiu, Guxian, Cangxian, and Xianxian. If they are not suppressed quickly, they will inevitably become a problem. It has now been decided to dispatch troops from the 29th Army to take on the responsibility of guerrilla warfare. Before the Military Sub-Committee was dissolved, the troops stationed in Hebei and Chahar provinces were stationed in sections, and the defenses were dense. Now, they are completely filled by the 29th Army, from Dushikou in eastern Chahar to the Tianjin-Beiping area. The defense line is vast, and Beiping can barely exert its joint efforts. If there is an emergency, it is difficult to allocate troops. The closure of the Tianjin-Goubao Security Command was handled by Liu Jialuan, Chief of Staff of the Pingjin Garrison Headquarters, who was sent to come and count the files. There are still more than sixty cases that have not been closed, so it is inconvenient to transfer them to Beiping. It is planned to set up an office-like agency in Tianjin after the establishment of the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Office to handle them locally, so that banditry and theft cases do not need to be transferred. The Hebei-Chahar Pacification Office is expected to be established after the New Year. This kind of organization is relatively easy. After the dissolution of the Military Sub-Committee, there are more than 500 staff members who can be assembled at any time. The Pingjin Garrison Headquarters, the Tianjin-Goubao Security Command, and the Hebei-Chahar Pacification Office have the same nature and the same responsibilities. If the Pacification Office is established, the two agencies will be abolished. It is planned to start organizing the Pacification Office after the organization of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee is completed. The staff members below the group leaders of the Hebei-Chahar Political Affairs Committee have not yet been appointed. There are many recommendations, but for the sake of caution, although it is not necessary to use examination procedures, it is planned to conduct a brief screening to prevent fraud. The problems of Eastern Chahar, Eastern Hebei, and Tanggu are being negotiated. The issue of Eastern Hebei is more important. Whether Yin Rugeng is truly supported by the people and whether it is in line with international organizations is known to the world. If it has nothing to rely on, it only needs to withdraw its background, and an order can be issued to dissolve it immediately. I once said that the hope for foreign relations is nothing more than three points: 1. China and Japan should implement friendship and maintain peace in East Asia. 2. Maintain China's territorial integrity. 3. Both sides should send responsible persons to negotiate. Regarding the fake organization in Eastern Hebei, if they can meet each other frankly and respect the meaning of territorial integrity, they should first restore the organization in Eastern Hebei. The commissioner of the Aoyu Jimmi area should be appointed by the Hebei Provincial Government, and Yin Rugeng should withdraw from the war zone. What hope is there to discuss again? Now Yin occupies the war zone, controls the mouth of the Datang Sea, and intercepts the salt and other taxes to kill the cargo transportation in North China. Is this really the true will of the people? If I have no scruples, it will be very easy to solve. In the Eastern Chahar incident, Guyuan and Douchang retreated due to the weakness of the troops. The situation there has not changed. I am not prepared to meet with anyone from the Japanese side in Tianjin. The Japanese side is responsible for negotiating the three issues of Eastern Hebei, Eastern Chahar, and Tanggu. He will go to Changchun within a few days to report to the Commander of the Kwantung Army and ask for instructions before returning to continue the discussion. Regarding the affairs of the Beijing-Ning Road Bureau, I received a telegram from Minister Kong this morning saying that Chen Juesheng will be appointed as the director of the bureau, and the order will be issued soon. Therefore, I directly sent Chief Councilor Chen (Juesheng) to act as the agent. The outside world does not know the truth about this matter, and there is much speculation. In fact, in the Luan East area, the establishment of the fake Eastern Hebei Xin Yu Section Supervision Office is also planning to interfere in the road administration. If there is no responsible person to hand over early, it will inevitably be a continuation of the severance of the section outside the pass. What is the truth? It will become clear over time, and there is no need to rush to defend it. I once said that a general, when facing the battle, although he cannot help but have a retreat, he should not show a defeat. Once there is a defeat, the morale of the army will be scattered, and the morale will be frustrated, and collapse is inevitable. The situation in North China shows people a defeat everywhere, which inspires people's covetous thoughts. We must uphold the meaning of not losing our own territorial sovereignty and strive to support it." (December 26th)</p>
<h3>The Origin of Banditry in Eastern Shandong: The Main Reason Is That People Have No Work and No Food to Eat; The Magistrate of Rongcheng County Presents a Detailed Report on Preventing Banditry</h3>
<p>Yantai Dispatch: A bandit outbreak occurred in Jiaozhou recently, gathering thousands of people and spreading to four or five counties. Zhan Shutang, commander of the 81st Division, led troops to search and suppress them. After repeated efforts, they have been completely suppressed. However, the bandits have been lurking among the people and spreading rumors, which has a considerable history. In addition, the loss of the Northeast has prevented people from going there to make a living. The fishing and salt industries along the coast have also been hit hard. Poor people have no work and no food to eat, so evil sayings are easy to enter. Fortunately, the bandits' force is insufficient and their organization is not tight, so they can be quickly suppressed. Now, the counties are conducting a household registration check very seriously to reduce the seeds left behind by the bandits. Qiu Zhongdu, the magistrate of Rongcheng County, recently submitted a document to the provincial government detailing the origin of the bandits and presenting methods of prevention. His document is as follows: 1. The reason why the Red Bandits were able to lurk and spread rumors in Wen, Rong, Yang, and Mou counties and riot is nothing more than the following reasons: a. These counties are too far away from the province and have no troops stationed there. b. The fishing and salt industries have been bankrupted, and many of those engaged in fishing and salt have no food to eat. c. Most of the people in the education circles in these counties are graduates of primary and secondary schools. They have neither received advanced education nor been aware of the current situation. d. In the past, most of the poor people in the counties went to the Northeast to make a living. Now, the Northeast is very restrictive, and they cannot go out. As a result, there are many people who do not have a good life, and the Red Bandits recognize this as a great place to promote redification. This is the reason why the Red Bandits lurk and promote themselves in these counties. Two months ago, I detected a Red Bandit organization in Shidao, so I immediately sent the local militia and public security to conduct a real investigation and pay attention to it at any time. This time, the Red Bandits originally planned to riot in Shi on November 29. Because our defenses were very strict, we captured seven Red Bandits who came to Shi to gather on the 28th. At the same time, we suppressed and captured the bandit organization in Shi, so their plan was revealed and could not be implemented. The Red Bandits who fled from Rong to Wen and Mou have united with those in the Wen Mou Hai area to carry out riots. Fortunately, your Excellency sent a team to encircle and suppress them, and they have not caused a major disturbance. Most of them have been gradually cleaned up. In the future, the aftermath should focus on implementing rural cleansing, but attention should also be paid to the four reasons mentioned above to avoid being used by the Red Bandits again. I believe that in the future, a part of the military force should be stationed in the east of Yantai and stationed in the Wen Mou area on a regular basis to strengthen the garrison. For fishermen and salt miners, we must earnestly find ways to provide relief. All primary school teachers in the counties should be given strict training, and they should be required to find a real guarantor before they are allowed to be employed. For the poor and unemployed vagrants, we should conduct an investigation. If they are purely residents of other counties, they should be immediately expelled. If they are local people who used to rely on going to the Northeast to make a living, the counties should find ways to force them to implement civil education methods, so that they can instill knowledge and change their thinking. If we can do so, the Red Bandit troubles in these counties can be eradicated forever. My humble opinion is as follows. I respectfully submit this document to your government for inspection and instructions. If you are willing to accept it, please also instruct the counties to implement it, so as to eliminate the banditry.</p>
<h3>Northeastern Soybean Dampness</h3>
<p>Bathhouses Transformed into Dry Bean Factories</p>
<p>Harbin Dispatch: This year's soybean production in the Northeast has suffered from excessive rainfall, resulting in abnormally damp soybeans with high moisture content. This situation has caused inconvenience for export to Europe and for sales and transportation. At the same time, the method of processing these damp beans has become a significant concern for farmers and bean merchants. Recently, an employee of the North Manchurian Suihua Pseudo-Railway Bureau has researched a solution for processing damp beans, achieving considerable success. Their drying method involves utilizing the "earth beds" (地炕) within old-style bathhouses to dry the damp soybeans. This method can dry forty to fifty tons of soybeans in a single day and night. Even the lowest quality beans, originally considered substandard, can be transformed into second-grade quality after drying. These dried bean bathhouses can generate profits of eighty to over a hundred yuan per day and night. Since the implementation of this method, most bathhouse operators in the area have shifted their focus to drying beans, completely abandoning their original purpose of providing public hygiene services. As a result, the local population has suffered, accumulating significant amounts of dirt on their bodies. The transformation of bathhouses into dry bean factories has spread throughout North Manchuria, becoming a source of amusement. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<p>Inspector Ding Visits the County for Inspection</p>
<p>Jiading: Jiangsu Inspector Yi Chao-wu, accompanied by his staff, arrived in Jiading from Shanghai on the afternoon of the 28th to conduct an inspection. He inquired about the county's financial and self-governance situation at the county government. Subsequently, County Magistrate Xu and Section Chief Ouyang accompanied him to inspect the prison, public security bureau, education bureau, educational association, central people's education center, Kuishan central school, and the county party headquarters. Around 5:00 PM, they traveled by the Shanghai-Nanjing railway to Taicang.</p>
<p>Various Organizations Request Strict Prohibition of Prostitution</p>
<p>Jiaxing: Jiaxing is rife with private prostitutes, and despite strict crackdowns by public security authorities, there has been no significant improvement. Recently, authorities considered implementing a public prostitution system. The First District Branch directly under the County Party Headquarters, considering this system to be detrimental to public morals, convened a meeting on the 29th with members of various branches and organizations to discuss the issue of eradicating private prostitution. It was generally agreed that implementing public prostitution might not eliminate private prostitution, and that prostitution is deeply and profoundly harmful to society. As a result, five principles for prohibiting prostitution were decided upon and submitted to the county government for investigation and enforcement: 1. Utilize baojia (neighborhood watch) to strictly prohibit prostitution. 2. Severely punish hotels that accommodate prostitutes. 3. Establish a Jiliang Institute (refuge for women) or add a women's section to the vagrant vocational training center, sending captured prostitutes there for education and rehabilitation. 4. Find ways to send prostitutes back to their original hometowns. 5. If pimps are caught, they should be detained for fifteen days, and fines should not be accepted in lieu of detention.</p>
<p>Holding a Rice Stem Borer Eradication Campaign</p>
<p>Wuxi: The First District Office held its first Rice Stem Borer Eradication Campaign on the 29th, chaired by Qian Zhongliang. The following resolutions were passed: 1. Regarding publicity for the eradication campaign, the District Office will organize a publicity team to work in groups, preparing publicity materials and going to rural areas for on-site promotion. Three teams will be formed: the first team will be responsible for Xi Jing Town and will be led by the Shan County District Office; the second team will be responsible for Xia Du Town, Da Yao Township, Huangni Town, and Qingming Town, and will be led by the Public Security Bureau and the People's Education Center; the third team will be responsible for Huishan Town, Yinglong Town, Huihe Town, Lihua Town, and Huangxiang Township, and will be led by the Education Bureau and the County Party Headquarters. 2. Regarding implementing eradication measures, the responsible personnel from each team will, together with the local township heads, encourage farmers to burn rice roots and flood low-lying fields. The period from January 6th to 11th of the fifteenth year of the Republic will be designated for publicity and eradication, and the District Office will determine the group work schedule and notify the relevant parties to implement it.</p>
<p>Representative of Jiangsu Province Rushes to the Construction Site</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: In order to expedite the closure of the breach in the Dongzhuang embankment in Shandong, the Provincial Flood Relief Headquarters has appointed Tu Shuxiang, Xu Xicheng, and Wu Xiafeng as committee members to be stationed permanently at the construction site. Subsequently, Committee Member Wang was unable to travel due to illness and was replaced by Xu Baoyu as a representative. However, Xu was also unable to accompany them as scheduled due to other commitments, so Shen Baojun was appointed as a representative. Mr. Wu and Mr. Shen, recognizing that the project is now being handled by Committee Member Kong Xiangrong, acting chairman of the Dong Committee, should rush to the construction site as soon as possible to facilitate communication. On the 29th, they accompanied him to the provincial headquarters to meet with Chairman Yu Tang of the General Committee to discuss all matters. That evening, they boarded a through train to the north. The Wang Jinfa sailboat from Qi Dong Sanhe Port, carrying 17 passengers and goods, set sail for Chongming on the afternoon of the 19th. When it reached the waters off the old port of Chongming, it encountered a sudden gale that broke the mast, causing the boat to capsize instantly. The boat owner, Wang Jinfa, and all 17 passengers were submerged. The goods drifted away with the waves. Boatmen Zhu Lijiang and Zhu Gengang, who knew how to swim, managed to swim to the shore and escaped danger. They returned to Qi Dong on the 10th to inform the families of the victims, who went to search for the bodies. According to confidential information received by Yu Guangtao, the leader of the third squad of the first company of the 23rd Security Brigade stationed at Sanlang Temple, there was a clandestine arms manufacturing facility in Mujia Village, across the river from Cao Liuzhuang, about four or five li southwest of the town. Squad Leader Yu led his squad to the location on the 19th. While they were distributing work, they were immediately surrounded and apprehended. Fourteen individuals were arrested on the spot, including Bian Fujie, Li Guanggui, Liu Qing, Luo Gang, Liu Zhuangzi, Zhao Sanzi, Wang Zechun, Song Xueren, Wang Xinfa, Wang Dacai, Min Renxi, Zhao Songshan, Wang Wenjie, and Han Yuncheng. A large number of manufacturing machines and various rifle parts were also confiscated. They were immediately sent to the headquarters of the first company in Sanduo Town. Acting Company Commander Shi Xingrui, considering the seriousness of the case, transferred them to the county on the 20th and detained them in the Qianming Temple within the city, the location of a company headquarters. On the 21st, a document was prepared and sent to the county government for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Ancient Temple Robbed, Tenant Killed</p>
<p>Ningbo: The ancient Tianmu Temple, located on Tianmu Mountain near the Ci Xi He Mu area, is home to Abbot Bingqing, who has a small accumulation of wealth. Several tenant farmers cultivate the land, providing them with a reasonable livelihood. At around 10:00 PM on the 18th, more than ten bandits, speaking with mixed accents and wielding wooden-cased guns, stormed into the temple. Upon entering, they tied up Abbot Bingqing and the workers Yan Abing with ropes, forcing them to reveal the location of their hidden silver. Tenant farmer Wang Changfu attempted to go down the mountain to report the crime but was shot in a vital area by a bandit and died instantly. The bandits then went upstairs and searched, robbing more than eighty silver dollars in cash, along with countless clothes and utensils. Not satisfied with their loot, the bandits not only beat Abbot Bingqing but also injured tenant farmer Yan Abing's forehead with wooden sticks, causing a gaping wound with profuse bleeding, before fleeing with shouts. Afterwards, the victims reported the incident, and the authorities dispatched personnel to the temple to investigate and ordered the local public security sub-bureau to solve the case within ten days.</p>
<p>Zhejiang-Fujian Inspector Arrives in Shaoxing, Transfers to Sheng County</p>
<p>Shaoxing: Zhejiang-Fujian Inspector Chen Zhaoying, who departed from Hangzhou to inspect various counties in eastern Zhejiang, arrived at the Wuyun station at 9:30 AM on the 27th, accompanied by Secretary Li Xiong, Section Chiefs Wu Chunxiang and Hu Bochong, staff member Chen Peizhi, accountant Wu Xingchao, guard captain Wu Biao, and more than ten fortunetellers. He disembarked from the train, greeted the welcoming party at the station, and then proceeded to the county government with Commissioner He for a brief rest. He met with the county government secretaries and section chiefs to inquire about the political situation in Shaoxing and delivered a speech at the government auditorium. Afterwards, he attended a banquet hosted by the county party headquarters, using the Longshan Hotel as his temporary residence. A public banquet was held at the county government in the evening. He plans to proceed to Sheng County for inspection on the 18th, accompanied by Commissioner He.</p>
<p>Chu Yupu's Concubine Arrested for Smoking Opium</p>
<p>Xuzhou: Chu Yupu, the former military governor of Zhili, was shot dead by Liu Zhennian. Most of his assets were secretly controlled by his favorite concubine, making it difficult to investigate. On the evening of the 26th, she was lying on a couch in a secret room with her brother Chu Yuzhang, also known as Chu Ruisheng, indulging in opium smoking, when they were discovered by the head of the county government's anti-opium section. He immediately led police to arrest them, seizing both of them along with a complete set of opium paraphernalia and two boxes of opium paste, and brought them to the government for legal proceedings.</p>
<p>Chumen Egg Industry Gradually Declining</p>
<p>Wenzhou: The Chumen egg industry in the third district of Yuhuan flourished in 1931. According to egg merchants, exports that year totaled around 300,000 pieces. This fell to 150,000 in 1932, about 110,000 in 1933, and about 50,000 to 60,000 in 1934. This year, the number is likely to be even lower. The reason is that farmers, facing economic hardship, are mostly refraining from raising chickens, leading to a gradual decline in production and a corresponding drop in exports.</p>

<h3>Eurasia's New Giant Aircraft Arrives in Longhua Yesterday Afternoon. The Model, Speed, and Equipment Are Identical to the Previous Two Aircraft. Miss Shi Yongyi Presents Flowers, and Li Jingcong Delivers a Welcome Speech</h3>
<p>The third Junkers tri-motor giant aircraft borrowed by Eurasia Aviation Corporation from Germany, piloted by the renowned German aviator Guri Ge and others, took off from Berlin and arrived in Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 4:15 PM, landing at Longhua Shanghai City Airport. Despite extremely adverse weather conditions encountered en route, it was still able to fly to Shanghai on schedule, which is particularly commendable. Yesterday, people from all walks of life, both Chinese and foreign, flocked to welcome the aircraft. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Airport Arrangements</p>
<p>After receiving a telegram from the aircraft company the day before yesterday afternoon, reporting that the aircraft had flown from Hanoi to Hong Kong, they dispatched personnel to the airport yesterday morning to arrange everything. In addition to the Chinese and German national flags being raised high outside the temporary executive office, the interior equipment was the same as before. Secretaries and staff of the company were responsible for reception.</p>
<p>Enthusiastic Welcome</p>
<p>Yesterday's weather was gloomy and cold, with a biting north wind. However, many Chinese and foreign guests flocked to participate in the welcome. In addition to the company's general manager, Mr. Li Jingcong, who took a flight from Beijing to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM to welcome the aircraft, those present included Mr. Walter, the Shanghai representative of Deutsche Lufthansa; Mr. Noli Mo, the Minister of Eastern Culture of the German National Socialist Party; Mr. Stasi, the Shanghai representative of Junkers Aircraft Factory; Mr. Weiteman of the German Association; officials from the German Consulate; and more than a hundred German guests, both male and female. Secretaries of the company, such as Zha Zhenhu, Liao Guanxuan, and Wang Yanyun, were mobilized to provide reception.</p>
<p>Landing Situation</p>
<p>Around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon, Chinese and foreign guests had arrived one after another and gathered in the Eurasia Company's Shanghai station office, warming themselves by the stove. At 4:15 PM, airport staff reported that the giant aircraft had arrived. The crowd immediately rushed outside and stood waiting. The aircraft was spotted in the eastern sky. After about two minutes, the aircraft flew over the airport, and the sound of the engines reverberated throughout the field. After circling twice in the air, it landed safely at 4:25 PM. The aircraft's fuselage was silver-gray and bore the number Junkers J.U.52. The fuselage was marked "D AMAR," and the tail was painted with the red swastika, the emblem of the German National Socialist Party. All the speed and safety equipment were identical to the two previously borrowed aircraft. The company's general manager, Li Jingcong; the head of the aviation group, He En; and Chinese and foreign guests rushed forward, crowding around the aircraft. Before long, the door opened, and the four pilots, including the famous aviator Guri Ge, stepped down. Except for Guri Ge, who wore an ordinary black suit, the other three wore black aviation suits. Miss Shi Yongyi presented flowers to each of them, and then took a group photo with Li Jingcong and others. They then proceeded to the passenger reception room, where Mr. Li delivered a welcome speech, and Mr. Guri Ge gave a reply. Finally, they shared champagne. The gathering dispersed around 5:00 PM.</p>
<p>Four Arriving Together</p>
<p>The aircraft departed from Germany and flew directly to China. The arriving personnel included the chief pilot, Guri Ge; the co-pilot, Tu Xu; the mechanic, Klausen; and the telegraph operator, Baulier. During the European War, Chief Pilot Guri Ge served in the military and repeatedly flew to the front lines for bombing missions. He also fell from airplanes multiple times, surviving by sheer luck. However, he suffered severe leg injuries, with a fractured ankle. After being fitted with a wooden leg, he walked normally. After the European War, he joined a civilian airline, namely Deutsche Lufthansa.</p>
<p>Flying to Shanghai as Scheduled</p>
<p>According to Mr. Walter, the Shanghai representative of Deutsche Lufthansa and vice chairman of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, speaking to a New News Agency reporter, the Junkers 52 giant aircraft, piloted by the famous German aviator Guri Ge and others, took off from Berlin on the 20th and flew to China along the same route as the previous two aircraft, via the Indian Ocean, Rangoon, Hanoi, and Hong Kong. It flew to Hong Kong on the 28th and continued to fly to Shanghai from Hong Kong at 9:00 AM on the 29th. Although the weather was very bad en route, it was still able to reach Shanghai within the scheduled flight time of seven hours. Most of this seven-hour flight was spent speeding through the clouds, as the weather was bad and the air pressure was low. Therefore, blind-flying instruments were used for the flight. The journey from Germany to China is 15,200 kilometers, and being able to fly there in nine days is particularly commendable.</p>
<p>Mr. Li's Speech</p>
<p>Li Jingcong, general manager of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, said in his welcome speech: "Distinguished guests, today Mr. Guri Ge piloted the Junkers 52 giant aircraft directly from Germany to China. On behalf of Eurasia Aviation Corporation, I extend a sincere welcome to Mr. Guri Ge. Deutsche Lufthansa has leased three giant aircraft, and we are especially grateful for this kindness. This is the third time flying from Germany to China, which proves that direct communication between Eurasia is no longer a problem. We still need to continue our efforts in terms of personnel. There is a Chinese saying, 'Everything must pass three times.' Direct communication between Eurasia has now occurred three times. We should strive to realize direct communication between Eurasia under this significance. I propose a toast with champagne to wish you all good health."</p>
<p>Pilot's Reply</p>
<p>The chief pilot, Mr. Guri Ge, gave a reply, saying briefly: "Today, I am very honored to receive such a warm welcome from General Manager Li and everyone. This is my first time coming to China, and I am very happy to fly directly from Germany to China this time. I hope that both sides will continue to work hard to make the Eurasia airline route a reality as soon as possible." After the speech, Eurasia Corporation immediately hired cars to take the pilots to the International Hotel on Jingan Temple Road for rest.</p>
<p>Today's Banquet</p>
<p>Mr. Li Jingquan is scheduled to host a banquet at Xinghua Lou today to welcome the pilots. At that time, he will also invite Chinese and German celebrities to accompany them. It is also learned that Guri Ge plans to stay in Shanghai for two or three weeks. After inspecting the company's existing routes, he will return to his country. The other three, the co-pilot Tu Xu, the mechanic Klausen, and the telegraph operator Baulier, plan to stay in Shanghai for a week before taking a ship back to their country. The giant aircraft that arrived in Shanghai yesterday will be deployed slightly and then fly to Chengdu to join the Shanghai-Xinjiang-Chengdu line.</p>
<h3>President and Vice President of the Supervisory Yuan Arrive in Shanghai</h3>
<p>Xu Chongzhi to Hold Oath-Taking Ceremony on New Year's Day Next Year. Yu Youren, president of the Supervisory Yuan, left Beijing by night train the night before last at 11:00 PM and arrived at the North Station in Shanghai at around 7:00 AM yesterday morning. He went directly to his residence at Jingan Villa on Jingan Temple Road to rest. Xu Chongzhi, vice president of the Supervisory Yuan, also arrived in Shanghai on the same train. Mr. Xu will return to Beijing in the next few days and is scheduled to hold an oath-taking ceremony on New Year's Day next year.</p>
<h3>National Highways Reach 90,000 Kilometers. Announcement by the Highway Department of the Economic Development Council</h3>
<p>According to Shiye News Agency, road construction in our country has progressed rapidly in recent years. According to an announcement by the Highway Department of the National Economic Council yesterday, the total length of motorable roads in the country has now reached 90,000 kilometers. The main trunk lines connecting the provinces have a total length of over 20,000 kilometers. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>90,000 Kilometers of Motorable Roads</p>
<p>According to statistics, in 1921, there were only over 1,000 kilometers of roads in the country. By 1931, this had increased to over 66,000 kilometers, an increase of four to five times in ten years. Recently, there have been 90,000 kilometers of motorable roads. Among these 90,000 kilometers, Guangdong has over 11,000 kilometers, ranking first in the country. Shandong and Jiangxi each have over 5,000 kilometers. Other provinces with over 2,000 to 3,000 kilometers account for more than half of the country's provinces. However, in terms of the degree of progress in recent years, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Anhui, Hunan, and Hubei have been the fastest. This year, the northwestern and southwestern provinces have been the most active. The reasons for this are, on the one hand, the planned and systematic construction, and on the other hand, the needs of politics and military affairs.</p>
<p>Active Construction of Connecting Highways</p>
<p>In order to rationalize highway construction in various provinces, the Economic Council has integrated the highway plans of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui into a systematic connecting highway network, consisting of six lines: 1. Jinghang, 2. Shanghai-Hangzhou, 3. Jingwu, 4. Hangzhou-Huizhou, 5. Sujia, 6. Yichang, with a total length of 1,043 kilometers. Of these, 538 kilometers have been completed, and the unbuilt sections will be completed by 1933. As a result, the range of interconnected motorable roads will be expanded to over 2,000 kilometers. The scope of connection will then be expanded to seven provinces: Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, Hunan, and Henan. The planned system includes 11 trunk lines and 60 branch lines, with a total length of 22,300 kilometers. After phased construction, Fujian, Shaanxi, Gansu, Qinghai, and other provinces will also be included in the supervision scope. Currently, the Economic Council's provincial connecting highway lines have a total length of 29,293 kilometers, of which the trunk lines are 17,255 kilometers long and the branch lines are 2,938 kilometers long. As of the end of October this year, a total of 20,289 kilometers of road sections have been opened to traffic, with trunk lines accounting for 12,441 kilometers, including 6,350 kilometers with paved roads and 4,530 kilometers with dirt roads. The remainder are mostly under construction.</p>
<p>Progress Status of Trunk Line Projects</p>
<p>The progress status of various important trunk line projects is listed below: 1. The Jinghu trunk line, from Beijing via Jurong, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Wuxi, Changshu, to Shanghai, has been fully completed and opened to traffic. 2. The Jingwen trunk line, from Beijing via Yixing, Changxing, Hangzhou, Shaoxing, Sheng Linhai, Yueqing, to Wenzhou, has long been open to traffic, with a total length of 792 kilometers. The section south of Wenzhou is under construction. 3. The Shanghai-Guilin trunk line, from Shanghai via Hangzhou Tonglu, Shouchang, Jiangshan, Shangrao, Guixi, Dongxiang, Linchuan, Ji'an, Chaling, Hengyang, Lingling, Quanxian, Guilin, to Nanning, except for the sections from Shouchang to Longyou in Zhejiang Province, Dongxiang to Linchuan in Jiangxi Province, and Chaling to Hengyang in Hunan Province, which still require detours, the rest can be directly accessed by car. The total length of this line is 1,549 kilometers, and the completed section, calculated up to the Hunan border, has a total length of 1,324 kilometers. 4. The Jingqian trunk line, from Beijing via Wuhu, Huizhou, Nanchang, Liuyang, Changsha, Xiangxiang, Shaoyang, to Dongkou, can be directly accessed by car, with a total length of 1,564 kilometers. However, the section from Dongkou to Zhijiang is yet to be built. The total length of the entire line is 1,802 kilometers, but it is possible to reach Zhijiang via Changsha, Changde, and Yuanling, and then directly reach Guiyang in Guizhou. 5. The Jingchuan trunk line, except for the sections from Pukou to Wujiang in Jiangsu, Taihu to Susong in Anhui, and Huangmei to Guangji Xishui to Lijiaji in Hubei, which are either yet to be constructed or are under construction, the rest have long been opened to traffic. The completed sections have a total length of 943 kilometers, with a total length of 1,407 kilometers. 6. The Bianyue trunk line, from Kaifeng in Henan to Shaozhou in Guangdong, can be fully accessed by car, with a total length of 1,613 kilometers. 7. The Luoshao trunk line, except for the section from Luoyang to Lin'an in Henan, which is under construction, and the section from Linru to Laokou in Hubei, which is yet to be built, the section from Laokou via Changde and Changsha in Hunan to Xiaotang on the Guangdong border has been completed and opened to traffic, with a total length of 1,167 kilometers, and a total length of 1,638 kilometers. 8. The Jingshan trunk line, from Beijing to Hefei in Anhui Province, is the same as the Jingchuan trunk line. From Hefei to Xinyang in Henan Province, it is 3,698 kilometers long and can be accessed by car.</p>
<p>Border Area Highways to be Completed Next Year</p>
<p>In order to develop transportation in the northwestern border areas, the council directly constructed the Xilan and Xihan roads. The Xilan road starts from Xi'an and ends in Lanzhou, with a total length of 750 kilometers. It is the most important route for developing the northwest and consolidating border defenses and has been officially opened to traffic. The Xihan road is an important route connecting the Wei River basin and the Sichuan Basin. The section from Xi'an to Baoji was originally motorable, with a length of about 150 kilometers. The section from Baoji to Nanzheng has a total length of 253 kilometers and is currently under active construction. It is expected that the entire line will be open to traffic in January next year. Although highway construction in our country has shown development, automobiles and fuel are imported from abroad. In order to prevent loopholes, the Automobile and Oil Cooperation Committee and the Charcoal Automobile Research Committee, established by the council and the transportation committees of five provinces and cities, are actively researching self-sufficient vehicles and fuel.</p>
<h3>Taikoo Company's Guangdong Steamer Runs Aground in Guangdong. Passengers Rescued, Cargo Unloading Begins. Decision to Attempt Rescue When the Tide Rises.</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency: The British-owned Taikoo steamer Guangdong, with a total tonnage of 2,626 tons, which runs on the Shanghai-Guangdong route, set sail from the company's wharf on the Bund of the French Concession in Shanghai on the afternoon of the 24th of this month, loaded with cargo and passengers, bound for Guangdong. As it approached Gao Island in the Pearl River outside Guangzhou's port this morning, it ran aground due to fog. The British captain made efforts to rescue the vessel, but due to the heavy load, he was unable to free it. The hull suffered minor damage and was stuck on the rocks. After inspection, it was deemed that there were no major breaches.</p>
<p>Rescuing Passengers and Unloading Cargo</p>
<p>After receiving a telegram from the captain of the Guangdong, the Guangzhou Taikoo branch sent a ship to the grounding site to assist in the rescue. The passengers were transferred to the rescue ship and transported to Guangzhou. At the same time, the unloading of cargo, such as cotton yarn and foreign cloth, onto barges began. It is expected that once the cargo is unloaded, the vessel will be freed when the tide rises. The damaged area will then be sealed with cement. After being freed, the extent of the damage will be assessed to determine the repair method, whether it will be repaired in Guangzhou or Shanghai. This has not yet been decided.</p>
<p>British Warship Protection</p>
<p>The British cruiser HMS Dainty, with a tonnage of 1,162 tons, stationed in Hong Kong, has been ordered to sail to the grounding site to provide protection against theft. However, according to news from the Shanghai Taikoo Company, although the vessel has run aground, the damage is still minor. It is expected that it will be freed after the cargo is unloaded. There is no other cause for concern. The total amount of losses is currently unknown. It is also not known whether the unloaded cargo has been damaged by water.</p>
<h3>Bank Annual Closing This Year: All Banks Expected to Profit, but Commercial Banks' Profits Decline Compared to Previous Years; Money Shops Tighten Lending, Profits Feared to Be Just Average</h3>
<p>New Sound News Agency reports that various banks' second-half-year closing of accounts will commence with the savings department starting on the 15th and the commercial department starting on the 20th, simultaneously extending internal office hours based on each bank's accounting situation. Although yesterday was a regular weekly holiday, some banks remained open internally as usual. These days are within the banks' general ledger period, with busy receipts and disbursements. For example, the total exchange volume at the bank clearing house was 22,255,621.81 yuan the day before yesterday. All banks will be closed for three days for the New Year.</p>
<p>Smaller Surplus for Commercial Banks</p>
<p>A New Sound News Agency reporter learned from banking circles yesterday that, amidst the current decline of all industries, all lending by various banks has long been especially cautious. Moreover, bank lending is primarily based on collateral, so bad debts are minimal, and profits can still be obtained. The Central Bank is expected to have the largest surplus, followed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications. However, the profits of various commercial banks will be less than in previous years.</p>
<p>Money Shops Association Regular Meeting Tomorrow</p>
<p>The Money Shops Association is scheduled to hold a regular members' meeting tomorrow at 2:00 PM at its Ningbo Road location. In addition to approving January 23 as the final closing date for the 24th year of the Republic, they will also decide on the interbank lending rate for December and the matters to be prepared before the final closing. All money shops will be closed for two days during the New Year, in accordance with industry regulations.</p>
<p>All Shops Have Tightened Lending</p>
<p>A New Sound News Agency reporter learned from money shop circles yesterday that money shop lending is primarily based on credit, with collateral secondary. Although all shops have tightened lending, the closures of companies such as Huafeng Flour Mill, Jin Hing Real Estate Company, Taifeng Canned Food and Biscuit Company, China-England Pharmacy, and Lao Xiangtai Leather Goods Store this year have resulted in substantial debts owed to money shops through long-term lending and overdrafts. As a result, a small number of money shops have been heavily affected and have had to reorganize. Therefore, many money shops' profit reports this year are feared to be just average.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces Implement Joint Water Defense Covering Fourteen Counties, Including Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Shanghai</h3>
<p>To strictly prevent bandits from taking the opportunity to rob, the water police agencies of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces will delineate areas and implement joint defense starting today. To facilitate close communication, a third joint defense meeting is scheduled to be held on January 20 next year to discuss measures. Inland waterway merchants in this port will also send representatives to attend. The following are the details as investigated by a Daily News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Implementing Joint Defense</p>
<p>The Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial water police bureaus, noting that it is now winter, the weather is cold, inland waterways are dry and low, and navigation of ships is slow, and with the year-end approaching and various businesses busy receiving and remitting funds, it is easy to arouse the covetousness of bandits, especially on the Shanghai-Pinghu line (Shanghai to Pinghu), which has already been attacked by bandits several times. To proactively prevent this, a joint defense association has been organized and has already held three meetings, deciding to start implementing joint defense starting today.</p>
<p>Delineating Areas</p>
<p>The joint defense alert areas are divided as follows: In Jiangsu province, the nine counties of Shanghai, Fengxian, Jinshan, Qingpu, Wuxi, Wuxian, Wujiang, Wujin, and Yixing will be the responsibility of the Jiangsu Provincial Water Police Team for alert. In Zhejiang province, the six counties of Jiaxing, Pinghu, Jiashan, Tongxiang, Wuxing, and Changxing will be the responsibility of the Zhejiang Provincial Water Police Special Task Force and the Second, Third, Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, and Seventh Squadrons for alert.</p>
<p>Third Meeting</p>
<p>The Jiangsu and Zhejiang provincial water police bureaus believe that the areas delineated above are very broad, and the communication between counties and between the two provinces needs to be discussed in detail. It is learned that a third joint defense meeting is scheduled to be held on January 20 next year at the Jiashan Xitang Public Security Branch. It is reported that various inland waterway transport companies in this port also plan to send representatives to attend to provide assistance, so that waterway navigation will become more strictly secured.</p>
<h3>Fellow Villagers from Jing County in Shanghai Concerned About Banditry in Their Hometown, Sending Two Representatives to Nanjing and Wuhu to Join Local Representatives in Petitioning Anqing</h3>
<p>Fellow villagers from Jing County in Anhui province residing in Shanghai recently received letters from their hometown reporting that a remnant bandit gang has infiltrated the eastern townships of Ding and Cao in the county and once reached the northern township of Chitan Town last month, burning and looting. The situation is worsening, and large villages and towns such as Longtan, Huangtian, and Langqiaohe in the eastern township are in great danger. Bandit tracks have also been discovered in Caicunba in the northern township and Maolin Village in the southwestern township. A meeting was held yesterday to discuss measures, attended by Hu Puan, Zhu Jingan, Wei Shoujing, Hu Huisheng, Zhu Zunyi, and many others. It happened that fellow villagers from the county residing in Wuhu also sent a representative, Zha Shihan, to Shanghai to discuss the matter. They also invited Mr. Zha to jointly discuss the matter and decided to send representatives to Nanjing and Wuhu to join representatives from those two locations in going to Anqing to petition the Anhui provincial authorities, requesting that capable troops be dispatched to suppress the bandits quickly and pacify the people. Zhu Zunyi and Hu Naian were selected as representatives and are scheduled to depart on January 2, together with Mr. Zha, to contact Nanjing and Wuhu before proceeding to Anqing.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Shanghai to Use Japanese Currency, Implementation Decided to Start on New Year's Day</h3>
<p>Japanese residents in this port plan to issue a type of Japanese banknote, intending for mutual use among Japanese residents. However, this system may hinder our national monetary system. It is subtly learned that the Japanese side has decided to implement and use it starting on New Year's Day next year. According to general speculation, the Japanese residents' issuance of Japanese banknotes in Shanghai aims to promote Japanese goods. It is believed that when Chinese people obtain these banknotes, they will inevitably have to purchase Japanese goods in order to use them with the Japanese.</p>
<h3>Smoker Registration Deadline Approaching: Shanghai Public Security Bureau Issues Final Notice; Total of 30,636 People Registered Since June, 26,101 Men and 4,535 Women</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Public Security Bureau issued a final notice yesterday regarding the mandatory registration of smokers, stating: "Fellow smokers, it has been over five months since the city began implementing the smoking ban, transitioning from a period of free voluntary registration to a period of mandatory registration. It is stipulated that this year-end will also be the deadline. After the deadline, how will unregistered smokers be dealt with? I believe this is what unregistered smokers are eager to understand, and the bureau should also make it clear to smokers. I might as well take advantage of the approaching deadline for mandatory registration to briefly explain the handling of unregistered smokers as a final warning. The previous city government received a telegram from the chairman of the Military Affairs Commission's headquarters, ordering all smokers in the city to complete registration by the end of this year, without any extension. Naturally, we should comply and complete the registration. After registration, if the bureau finds unregistered smokers, regardless of age or illness, the issuance of smoking cessation permits will be uniformly suspended, and they will be sent to military law agencies to be sentenced in accordance with Article 8 of the Provisional Regulations on the Punishment of Crimes Related to the Prohibition of Smoking, to imprisonment for a term of six months to two years, and fined up to 200 yuan. Those with smoking addiction will be ordered to quit within a time limit. This is prescribed by law and cannot be relaxed. At that time, even if you want to register and obtain a permit to quit smoking at your leisure, it will definitely be impossible. Think carefully, is it better to voluntarily register now, or to be punished in the future? Needless to say, you will definitely distinguish very clearly. There are only two days left until the registration deadline. These two days are the last fleeting opportunity for unregistered smokers. The advantages and disadvantages of registering or not registering have been clearly stated above. Unregistered smokers should quickly surrender to the Public Security Bureau for registration within these two days, not only to avoid fines but also to quit smoking at your leisure. If you continue to be stubborn and attempt to hide, that is disobeying orders. After the mandatory registration deadline, any unregistered smokers discovered will be severely punished according to the law without any leniency. At that time, you may regret it too late. Therefore, unregistered smokers who see this article must carefully weigh the pros and cons, make a quick decision, and not hesitate on the wrong path, delaying your own detriment. I have said all that needs to be said, and each of you should take heed."</p>
<p>The registration of smokers in this city, which began on July 1, has been in progress for more than five months, and will end the day after tomorrow (31st).

<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Organizations Strive for the Shengsi Islands</h3>

The text of the petition stated: "To Chiang, President of the Executive Yuan, Chiang, Minister of the Interior, and Wu, Minister of Industry, the Shengsi Islands are the fisheries center of the outer seas of Jiangsu. In recent years, the Jiangsu Provincial Government has worked hard to improve fisheries on the islands, which has been resented by a small number of fishery magnates who have fabricated falsehoods to request the transfer of the islands to Zhejiang jurisdiction, destroying fisheries. Their intentions are clear. The matter concerns the livelihoods of millions of fishermen in Jiangsu, and we must fight to the death to defend it. Moreover, the national crisis is severe, and all provinces should unite as one. How can we create internal strife and rob each other? We respectfully request that the status quo be maintained in order to stabilize people's hearts. We are waiting for orders with urgency." Signed by the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries School, the Jiangsu Provincial Fisheries Experiment Station, the Jiangsu Provincial Lianyungang Fisheries School, and the Shanghai Fisheries Guidance Institute.</p>

<h3>Expiration of the Special District Court Agreement: Lawyers Association Engages in Research</h3>

<h3>Tea Shop Employee Commits Suicide by Poisoning</h3>
<p>Wang Shenghui, aged 30, from Jixi, Anhui Province, had been working as a senior clerk at Hongyitai Tea Shop at No. 289 Fada Road (opposite the Big Ben) for many years. His family resided in his hometown, while Wang lived alone in Shanghai. He recently suffered from leucorrhea and despite medical treatment, his condition did not improve. On the 26th, at 8 PM, he went to sleep. At 3 AM in the deep night, he suddenly experienced phlegm in his throat, groaning incessantly. His roommates discovered this and informed the manager, Yu Boliang (40 years old, from Wuyuan, Anhui). He was rushed to Renji Hospital for treatment. After examination by the doctor, it was determined that Wang had taken poison. He was immediately admitted for emergency treatment. The manager and colleagues in the shop knew that Wang was indeed suffering from leucorrhea and had recently shown no signs of distress. It was impossible to ascertain whether he had committed suicide by taking poison or had been poisoned by taking leucorrhea medicine. Ultimately, due to the deep poisoning, the treatment was ineffective, and he died in the hospital at 1:30 PM on the 28th.

<p>Marriage Congratulatory Speech</p>
<p>The marriage witness Chen Aishi and Shen Tianxin have jointly written a congratulatory speech. The wording is elegant. The words are: "It is said that the foundation of society lies in the family, and the foundation of ethics begins with husband and wife. Asking names and presenting betrothal gifts are established rules, and choosing auspicious dates should not be done without specific principles. In recent times, customs have declined, laws and regulations have not formed unified norms, and models have blindly followed foreign lands. Changing customs and transforming practices are unavoidable duties, and establishing rituals and civilizing the people are undeniable responsibilities. This is why the city first established the practice of collective marriage, and the Lake Society immediately followed suit. Now, the Lake Society is holding its first collective marriage ceremony. A total of twelve people are participating, and the chairman of the committee and the chairman of the executive committee will witness the marriage. We hope that the boudoir is peaceful and that your home is harmonious. We also hope that your children and grandchildren are healthy and will bring glory to our hometown. We offer these humble words to congratulate the newlyweds. New Year's Day, the 25th year of the Republic of China, Chairman of the Lake Society Chen Qicai, Chairman of the Executive Committee Shen Zechun."</p>
<h3>Two Missionaries Kidnapped in Guizhou Recount Life in Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>The Daily News reports that Mr. A. Haymran, a missionary from the New Zealand Inland Mission, who was previously kidnapped by Red bandits in northeastern Guizhou and northwestern Hunan, was released by the bandits on the 18th of last month. However, due to his illness, Mr. Haymran was only able to recount his experiences in the bandit area yesterday. Mr. Haymran was kidnapped by the bandits for a total of 413 days. As for Mr. R. Bosshardt, who was kidnapped with Mr. Haymran, his whereabouts are still unclear. The Red bandits have moved south from their old hideout. It is said that Mr. Bosshardt is now in Xupu County, western Hunan, and is in good condition, and efforts are being made to escape. Mr. Haymran was released because the bandits thought he was going to die. Mr. Haymran was ill for several weeks after his release and was very weak. He has been recuperating in hospitals in Changsha and here for many days and has recently recovered his health. Mr. Haymran plans to spend the winter here with his family before leaving Shanghai again.</p>
<p>Mr. Haymran's Kidnapping Experience</p>
<p>On October 2nd of last year (the 23rd year of the Republic of China), when the Red bandit Xiao Ke invaded 80 miles east of Guiyang, Mr. Haymran, Mr. Bosshardt, their wives, and their families were kidnapped by Xiao Ke's bandits. At that time, the Red bandits were moving northeast along a small road in southeastern Guizhou, while the Central Army was advancing along the main road. It was only known beforehand that there were many Miao bandits nearby, so the churches did not retreat. The Red bandits only stayed in Guizhou for one day and then abandoned Mrs. Haymran, Mrs. Bosshardt, Mr. Haymran, Mr. Bosshardt, and Miss Emblen. However, Miss Emblen was released a few days later. Afterwards, Mr. Haymran and Mr. Bosshardt fled east and west with the bandits for about 26 or 27 days. It was not until Xiao Ke and He Long joined forces that they became relatively stable. However, they were still constantly changing places in northwestern Hunan.</p>
<p>Red Bandits Treat Foreigners Better</p>
<p>The Red bandits treat the kidnapped foreigners quite well. The food they are given is the same as what the Red bandits eat (rice, peppers, etc.). However, the kidnapped Chinese are treated very cruelly, only given a little pot residue each day. When the Central Army planes come to bomb, the Red bandits hide the two foreigners near the bomb shelters. However, the kidnapped Chinese are all handcuffed or tied up and placed in the open air. According to Mr. Haymran, the Red bandits hate Britain the most because they consider Britain to be the most ferocious of the imperialists. They also consider New Zealand to be a British colony and a victim of imperialism like themselves, so they treat him well. However, they do not know that Mr. Bosshardt is a Swiss citizen, but was born in Manchester, England, and studied at the London Bible School. Therefore, they think of him as an imperialist spy, and their surveillance is stricter.</p>
<p>A Glimpse of Life in the Red Bandit Camps</p>
<p>The Red bandits suspected that Mr. Haymran and Mr. Bosshardt were imperialist spies, so they questioned them separately from time to time and carefully examined the photos of the churches and believers in Guizhou that they had disturbed. Because the church where Mr. Haymran and Mr. Bosshardt originally stayed had many photographic equipment, they were very suspicious. According to Mr. Haymran, these photos were stored by two other churches. Mr. Haymran said very little about life in the Red bandit camps. However, Mr. Haymran allowed himself to elaborate on the Red bandits' espionage techniques at a later date. He continued that the Red bandits were busy all day long, without a moment to spare. Each place where the Red bandits lived had a gathering place, and photos of Lenin and Marx were hung on the walls. The Red bandits also held meetings from time to time, and everyone had to give a speech, telling each other about their experiences as bandits.</p>
<p>The Life of Mr. Haymran and Mr. Bosshardt in the Bandit's Den</p>
<p>Mr. Haymran and Mr. Bosshardt lived and ate in the same place in the bandit's den, and were allowed to carry their own supplies. However, books such as the Bible were confiscated. According to Mr. Haymran, he once made two pairs of pants for a Red bandit with all the printed cloth he had. He also said that the hats worn by the Red bandits were small, pointed hats, like those worn by jockeys, with a five-pointed star symbol attached. Mr. Haymran and Mr. Bosshardt were punished by the bandits once, imprisoned in a dark room for five weeks. The reason for the punishment is still unclear. Every day, Mr. Haymran and Mr. Bosshardt would answer each other's questions about the Bible or sing hymns to pass the time.</p>
<p>Failed Escape Turns Into Teaching</p>
<p>Last winter, Mr. Haymran and Mr. Bosshardt once tried to escape, but were unfortunately captured and sent to the Red bandit court for trial. The Red bandit court is worth describing. The judge was the Red bandit leader, sitting high on a platform, and the prisoners also stood on the platform. Below the platform was the crowd. The results of the verdict were announced to the public, and the crowd was allowed to speak freely. The trial of Mr. Haymran and Mr. Bosshardt lasted a long time and was extended for a long time, so many people in the crowd left due to fatigue. When the Red bandit judge asked for the opinions of the crowd, one person shouted "Sentence them to death!" and another shouted "Spank them!" Finally, the judge advocated a fine. After the verdict, the two were detained with a Red bandit. However, this bandit was finally released because he was ordered to mend his socks himself. However, this reminded Mr. Bosshardt of his knitting skills. He made a crochet hook from chopsticks and used this needle to knit a pair of overshoes. Unexpectedly, this was praised by the Red bandits. Since then, they have often sent him wool to weave, and from time to time, they send old wool sweaters to him to re-weave. Mr. Haymran did most of the thread removal, while Mr. Bosshardt was busy with the weaving work. According to Mr. Haymran, his body was weakening day by day at this time, and his arms were also feeling numb. The Red bandits specially allowed him to eat with a spoon and gave him chicken eggs. Initially, the Red bandits called them "foreign dogs" or "running dogs of the imperialists." Before Mr. Haymran was released, they were already calling them "foreign gentlemen."</p>
<h3>Real Estate Market Stagnation - Lawsuit Involving Land Purchase Termination - Lu Zhongdao Sues Zhejiang Industrial Bank - Demands Termination and Compensation for Losses - Zhejiang Industrial Bank Also Files a Counterclaim</h3>
<p>In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the day before the September 18th Incident in Northeast China, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank sold its 30 mu, 2 fen, 3 li, and 9 hao of British-registered land located at the intersection of Xiaoshadu Road and Haifang Road to Lu Shendao, a wealthy businessman from Suzhou. Kui Yanfang, the director of the Real Estate Department of the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, represented the bank in signing a preliminary agreement with Lu, with the price set at 19,500 taels of silver per mu. Lu paid a deposit of 85,000 taels on the same day, and the transaction was to be completed once the bank had exchanged the official deed. Not long after, the bank completed the deed exchange and informed Lu to pay the balance and complete the transfer. However, Lu's funds were not yet collected, so he accepted Kui's suggestion to mortgage the land to the bank to pay the price with the mortgage money. He mortgaged it for 420,000 yuan, with a six-month redemption period. However, even after repeated extensions, until April of this year, when the fourth extension period expired, the bank urged redemption and refused to extend it further. Lu suddenly learned that the Public Works Department needed to requisition 3 mu and 5 fen of land from the entire plot for the construction of a road, and that the requisitioned land was in the heart of the plot, dividing the entire plot into two. Lu believed that the land in such a form was no longer useful, so he requested the bank to terminate the sales contract. After a long negotiation, no solution was reached. Recently, Lu hired Lawyer Xian Zhang to file a lawsuit against the Zhejiang Industrial Bank and its president Xu Xinliu in the First Special District Court, seeking termination of the contract and compensation for losses. The lawsuit stated that the defendant stated in the notice of preparing funds for transfer on October 24th of the 20th year that the deed had been exchanged on his behalf. Since the defendant claimed it had been exchanged, it should have been transferred to the plaintiff's name. However, the defendant used the mortgage relationship as an excuse and never transferred the ownership from the beginning. The plaintiff was never the nominal owner for a single day, but had repeatedly paid the deed transfer fee. The sale of the land was not completed with a written document transferring the rights, and there was a legal deficiency. He had sent a letter to the defendant declaring the termination of the contract, but the defendant refused to acknowledge it. Therefore, he had to sue to request the court to order the defendant to return the actual land price of 402,700 yuan, and to compensate the plaintiff for the loss of mortgage interest of 114,682.38 yuan at an annual interest rate of 9%, and to compensate the plaintiff for losses such as land tax, registration fee, and deed transfer fee of 7,572.50 yuan, and a brokerage fee of 8,391.60 yuan, as well as bear the litigation costs. After the lawsuit was filed, the bank hired Lawyers Wang Fuchang and Yuan Hanyun to submit a statement defending the case, based on the facts of the establishment of the sales contract and mortgage contract, the habits of land transfer in Shanghai, and the legal position of the contract, confirming that the ownership of the land had been legally transferred to the plaintiff. The plaintiff's claim for termination was inappropriate, and the court should reject his lawsuit and file a counterclaim against Lu Zhongdao, requesting the court to order Lu to repay the principal and interest of the mortgage of 480,016.39 yuan, as well as interest at an annual rate of 9.5% as agreed upon and litigation costs. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Daxi held a hearing. Both parties were represented by their lawyers, who presented evidence and debated each other. The court stated that the circumstances of the case were important and ordered the matter to be investigated and adjourned for further hearing.</p>

<h3>Assistant Manager of Xinda Fang Hotel Accused of Embezzlement - Two Sets of Account Books Found with Conflicting Balances</h3>
<p>Xia Zhanqi, a native of Nanhui, residing at No. 10 Ningbo Road in the French Concession, is 40 years old and was previously employed on a ship. In March of this year, he invested 1,000 yuan and partnered with friends to take over the Xinda Fang Hotel at the intersection of Baoyu Lane on Edward Road. Xia Linshu (with a 500 yuan share), a fellow townsman among the shareholders, was appointed manager, Yang Qing (also known as Lin Sheng), a fellow townsman, was appointed assistant manager, and Qian Xiaode was appointed accountant. After the hotel opened, it coincided with the market downturn. All the large and small hotels in Shanghai uniformly offered discounts to compete for business. The Xinda Fang Hotel suffered from poor business in this trend, and gradually accumulated losses, resulting in arrears in rent. The landlord sued in court, and on November 18th, the Second Special District Court executed the seizure of the Xinda Fang Hotel and auctioned off its assets to offset the rent arrears. Shareholder Xia Zhanqi checked the hotel's account books and found that there were two sets of account books, one with a balance of 1,580.874 yuan and one with a balance of 1,161.105 yuan, with a discrepancy between the two figures. It was balanced on October 2nd, but the accounts were written until November 3rd. There were no other accounts or remaining balances. He then discovered that the manager, assistant manager, and accountant had engaged in joint embezzlement and falsification of account books. He reported this to the French Concession Police, who dispatched detectives to arrest manager Xia Linshu, assistant manager Yang Qing, and accountant Qian Xiaode. After investigation, Yang Qing was released because there was no evidence of collusion in illegal activities. Xia Linshu and Qian Xiaode were escorted to the Second Special District Court, where a lawyer from the Police Department filed a public prosecution against them for the crime of embezzlement in accordance with Article 336 of the Criminal Law and were detained in custody. The day before yesterday, Judge Xiong Yicui of the Second Special District Court opened a special court hearing. The plaintiff Xia Zhanqi brought all the account books to the court and stated that the general ledger and the circulating ledger were missing. He also appointed a lawyer to represent him in the case and filed an ancillary civil lawsuit, seeking to recover the embezzled money of over 1,000 yuan. When questioned, Xia Linshu confessed that he was the manager and that the money from daily sales was handed over to him by the accountant for safekeeping. The missing 400 yuan from the account was taken away by the plaintiff, Dai Jinsheng, and Wu Boyi. Dai and Wu are now not in Shanghai. Qian Xiaode confessed that he was introduced to Xinda Fang as an accountant by Zhou Xiqing of the Hulu Steamer Division on May 1st. There were two sets of account books. The new account book was replaced when Wu Boyi joined as a shareholder. The remaining money on both accounts was used for expenses and there was no embezzlement. The accounts from November 3rd to 17th were written in a new book and handed over to Wu Boyi. The court verified the confessions and reviewed the account books, and then ordered an adjournment for further hearing at a later date.</p>
<h3>The Case of Buying Silver Dollars - Decision to Prosecute by the Police</h3>
<p>Zhenjiang police officers previously captured three suspects, Wang Minggao and others, who were buying silver dollars and seized hundreds of silver dollars. Wang and others confessed that they were instigated by Liu Zhengxi, a native of Zhenjiang, from the Rongtai Cigarette Paper Shop at No. 269 Jiangxi Road in Shanghai. The Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance sent a letter to the Shanghai District Court, requesting assistance in the arrest. The court transferred the letter to the First Special District Court because Jiangxi Road was under the jurisdiction of the First Special District Court. The First Special District Court issued a warrant to the General Police Department, and Chinese Detective Wu Chunrong arrested Liu and escorted him to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. The day before yesterday, Chief Judge Feng Shide of the First Special District Court opened a hearing to continue the interrogation. According to the police lawyer, Wang Yaotang, in accordance with the letter from the District Court, the police decided to prosecute the case. However, the police had gone to the District Court to investigate the evidence, but the court could not clarify the situation because it was entrusted by the Department of Finance. Therefore, he requested the court to send a letter to the Jiangsu Department of Finance to retrieve the files in order to understand the facts. When questioned, Liu Zhengxi confessed that Wang Minggao had previously worked in Rongtai, but had left long ago and was being framed. He hired lawyer Wu Linkun to request bail. The court stated that it was currently in the evidence collection period and it was difficult to grant bail, so Liu was ordered to be returned to custody and a further hearing was scheduled. The police were also ordered to retrieve all the account books of Rongtai for examination.</p>

<h3>Shanghai-Hangzhou Train Kills Rural Woman</h3>
<p>At 7:09 AM yesterday morning, the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway's 31st early express train, heading from Shanghai North Station to Hangzhou, passed through Meilong Station, at the 20-kilometer mark. At around 8 AM, a rural woman, about 20 years old, was walking on the tracks. When the passenger train arrived, she was unable to avoid it and was crushed to death by the 62nd locomotive of the train. The conductor reported this to the stationmaster, who dispatched road police to take care of the matter. The local bailiff was notified to perform an examination. The Railway Administration paid 20 yuan for the coffin and ordered the local bailiff to summon the family of the deceased to the station to identify the body and arrange for burial.</p>
<h3>Railway Worker Crushed in Two Pieces</h3>
<p>Guan Shitian, a 23-year-old native of Suqian County, Jiangsu Province, was working as a railway worker at the Xinlonghua Railway Station on the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway.

Guan was unable to avoid it and was crushed in two pieces by the train, dying on the spot. Li Huapu, the police chief of the local branch station, learned of this and confirmed the facts. He notified the family of the deceased. Because they did not want to report the incident for examination, the Railway Administration purchased a coffin and buried the deceased, and provided compensation to the family of the deceased in accordance with regulations.</p>
<h3>Fire at Qinghe Balloon Factory</h3>
<p>The Qinghe Balloon Factory, located at No. 874 Baoshan Road, Zhabei, is operated by Japanese merchants and specializes in manufacturing various balloons. Because the New Year is approaching, there is a great need for goods, so they are processing and manufacturing day and night. However, the gas in the balloons must be made with nitric acid. A slight mistake can easily cause a fire. At around 4 PM the day before yesterday afternoon, while the workers were working, they accidentally set fire to the nitric acid, causing a raging fire. The fire immediately broke through the roof. Fire brigades from various sections drove to the scene and tried to put out the fire. After some time, the fire was extinguished, but only one building was destroyed, and thousands of balloons inside the building were reduced to ashes.</p>
<h3>Automobile Collision on Xietu Road</h3>
<p>At 4:30 PM the day before yesterday, a Zhenjiang native named Zhong Yao (driver's license number 14648), while driving a car turning at the intersection of Xietu Road in West Shanghai, heading south from the east, had to swerve to avoid a manure cart blocking the road. Unexpectedly, a car driven by a Frenchman, Elias Laut (transliteration, license number 19745), came speeding towards them, resulting in a collision between the two vehicles. Both cars sustained damage, and neither party would admit fault, leading to an argument. The police chief He Hanchen from the Sanjiaodi police station arrived, confiscated both driver's licenses, and submitted them to the General Bureau for settlement.</p>
<h3>Wu Zhijian Defrauds Goods and Flees</h3>
<p>A man named Wu Zhijian, residing at No. 10 Zhongxing Lane, Zhaofeng Road, this spring opened the Fuxing Yong firm at No. 6075 Baifu Lane, Broadway Road, Hongkou. He ordered goods from the Zhenfeng Wood Core Factory at No. 851 Feili Road, valued at approximately 3,277 yuan. To gain the factory's trust, Wu falsely claimed that certain commercial tycoons in Shanghai were shareholders of Fuxing Yong. Zhenfeng, without suspicion, delivered the goods in full. Wu paid with a Zhejiang Industrial Bank check dated May 31st, for 2,180 yuan. However, upon attempting to cash it, there were insufficient funds, causing it to be returned. Shi Fulin, the owner of Zhenfeng, a native of Shaoxing, went to negotiate on June 1st, only to find the place deserted. According to neighbors, the lease was terminated on the 30th, and all furniture, which was rented, had been taken away. Shi realized he had been defrauded and, after investigation, learned that Fuxing Yong had sold the purchased goods at less than half the cost. He filed a lawsuit with the First Special District Court for fraud under Article 339 of the Criminal Law, with a supplementary civil suit seeking the return of 3,277 yuan. The court approved the request and issued a summons for Wu Zhijian. However, his residence at No. 10 Zhongxing Lane, Zhaofeng Road, had been vacated for a month, making it impossible to deliver the summons. Yesterday, Judge Huang Risheng of the Fifth Criminal Division of the First Special Court summoned the plaintiff for preliminary questioning and adjourned the hearing for a later date.</p>

<p>Flames licking, hunger rampant, hot kisses hammered a thousand times, like young lovers, on the eve of military departure, unable to stop the myriad blooms of spring, redness about to burn eyebrows – Living.</p>
<p>Setting off the red sun, seen as even, thin clouds, how can the lake water resemble – Lake Water.</p>
<p>A hundred miles square, searching everywhere for that person, fireflies flickering several times – Autumn Night.</p>
<p>What is the matter with frying sorrow, the scheming mind refuses to yield even a little, insisting that the depths of Huoniu Mountain are the place, troubled and sleepless, having a time of enduring and refining night to achieve success – Touring Verdun. Like an example, the sea connecting the mountains, dragons and snakes rising from the land, scales and armor lifting, looking up at the heavenly shell leaking clouds – Car Crash.</p>
<p>Looking up at the long sky, a long cup of bitter wine, warming the liver and gallbladder like fire in the wind and snow – Resurrection.</p>

<p>Children's Education Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (1)(3)(9)</h3>
<p>—Original by Louisa M. Alcott Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Chapter 18 True Good Friends</p>
<p>The big storm had passed, and a period of peace had descended upon Plumfield, and continued for several weeks, because the older boys felt that Nan and Rob's disappearance was really their fault, so they watched over them like strict fathers, making others feel that they were too much trouble; as for the younger ones, after hearing Nan describe her adventures countless times, they regarded getting lost as the greatest tragedy in the world, and never dared to stick their heads outside the door, otherwise the night would suddenly come, and the ghostly black bull would appear dimly from the darkness.</p>
<p>"This is too good to be true, I'm afraid it won't last long," said Mrs. Jo, because having been engaged in raising children for many years, she knew that such tranquility often harbored the seeds of great disturbances.</p>
<p>Mrs. Jo was right; the peace was only a temporary respite, and a storm was brewing, so that in less than a month, a moral cataclysm shook the entire Plumfield.</p>
<p>Tommy's chickens can be said to be the origin of this disaster, because if they hadn't continued to lay so many eggs, he wouldn't have bought and sold them and made so much money. Money is the root of all evil, but it is also a useful root, without which we cannot survive, just as we cannot survive without sweet potatoes. In any case, Tommy could not do without it, because he spent money like water, so Mr. Bhaer had to force him to deposit the money in a savings bank, and gave him one for his own use - a magnificent tin building, with a name engraved on the door, and a high chimney on top, from which copper coins went down, and then it McMc'ed there until Mr. Bhaer allowed him to open a side door at the bottom, and then he could let them out.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Finance Over the Past Year</h3>
<p>— Wei Youfei</p>
<p>I. Overview of the Year's Financial Situation</p>
<p>The year 24th year of the Republic (1935) can be described as a year of unprecedented panic in China. Externally, the United States' silver purchase policy, which had been continuing since the 23rd year of the Republic, while suppressed by the equalization tax, still could not prevent the trend of silver exports. Due to the lack of actual reserves, a state of financial contraction and credit stagnation was formed, and industry and commerce showed even greater signs of decline. Shanghai, which held the authority over the nation's financial power, revealed a chaotic situation. The most obvious signs were the closure of financial institutions, followed by the gradual spread of financial panic throughout the country, and the closure of major industrial and commercial enterprises.</p>
<p>The power of foreign powers in China waxed and waned due to the evolution of the international situation. However, domestic small and weak industries and businesses were completely destroyed by the encroachment of various capitalist countries. At the same time, there were also frequent floods that inundated the entire country. The already dilapidated rural areas faced even more desperate circumstances. To summarize, in the first half of the year from January to June, imported foreign rice ranked first in the total national imports. Even without the floods, the plundering of farmers' livelihoods was evident.</p>
<p>In this economic panic beset by internal and external difficulties, the financial situation was tight. Although it experienced a brief respite due to various rescue efforts, from late October to the end of October, within ten days, the price of gold suddenly soared from 900 yuan to 1,200 yuan due to speculators' aggressive pushing. The soaring gold price also affected exchange rates. The prices of goods, which had been severely depressed for years, suddenly saw an alarming rise, and the market was in a state of extreme chaos. As a result, the government planned to reform the currency system and stabilize foreign exchange rates.</p>
<p>Now, I would like to briefly describe the financial situation of the entire year as follows:</p>
<p>Although China has long adopted the Gregorian calendar, the business community still adheres to the lunar calendar. The important financial seasons are still based on the three periods of the third, sixth, and ninth months of the lunar calendar, and the three festivals of the Dragon Boat Festival, Mid-Autumn Festival, and the Lunar New Year. Therefore, almost all the seasons in which disturbances occurred followed the aforementioned customs. For the convenience of narration, this article will still follow the divisions of the Gregorian calendar.</p>
<p>In the first quarter from January to March, January was still within the scope of the old lunar year of the 23rd year of the Republic. Due to the approaching settlement period, cash from the inland areas was transported to Shanghai, and reserves were relatively abundant, and interbank lending rates were also low. However, the number of bills cleared decreased by 100 million yuan compared to the same month last year, which shows the weakness of the financial situation. During the major settlement period in early February, eight Shanghai money shops declared bankruptcy due to their inability to recover loans. After the settlement period, although the export of silver weakened the reserves, the interbank lending rate was still extremely low, indicating that the activity of industry and commerce was not what it used to be. At the same time, financial circles also maintained cash to prevent emergencies, and the industrial and commercial sectors did not benefit much. The famous Shenxin No. 7 Factory even experienced a foreclosure dispute during this time.</p>
<p>The quarter from April to June was the most tense quarter. This period includes the expiration of money shops' loans at the end of April, the Dragon Boat Festival, and the banks' settlement dates. During the period at the end of April, financial institutions experienced liquidation due to their inability to recover loans and their inability to turn over funds. Mid-May was originally the most prosperous period for the silk, tea, and wheat markets, but in recent years, the prices of silk and tea have plummeted, and inventory has accumulated and cannot be moved. The wheat market also has no way out due to the import of foreign rice, which has further increased the import surplus. Therefore, the market has become a nominal market. In June, the silver and money industry maintained extreme caution in transactions. The market appeared very quiet on the surface, but was very tense underneath. Therefore, by the end of June, due to the banks' settlement, although the reserves did not decrease, the funding for operations caused great panic, so the interbank lending rate rose to 19%, and the commission for cross-day transactions rose to over 70%. No wonder the collapse of various silver and money shops emerged one after another, and Qingdao, Hankou, Beiping, Xiamen, Guangzhou... and other places across the country all echoed the situation.</p>
<p>At this time, news of the closure of major factories broke out, and floods also began to occur. At the same time, Sir Victor Sassoon took the opportunity to announce the pound sterling plan, enticing China to join the sterling bloc.</p>
<p>In the third quarter of July, August, and September, after a major storm, and due to the government's announcement of measures to rescue the market, the import of silver eased the money supply somewhat. However, it still could not break the dull situation. Due to the deepening financial panic in the inland areas, various inland remittance banks experienced a cash flow problem.</p>
<p>In October of the fourth quarter, after the quiet third quarter, domestic industries such as silk and tung oil were stimulated and eased due to the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian War, and the market also showed some activity. In mid-October, because the United States' silver policy did not develop further, and because the central bank purchased gold bullion, and the market's concerns about inflation, the price of gold bullion suddenly soared, and foreign exchange became unprecedentedly tight. The highest gold price reached a peak of 1,217 yuan. By early November, China's foreign exchange market had shrunk to about 20%. As a result, yarn, flour, tung oil, silk, and tea all rose sharply. The Ministry of Finance, in view of the uneven high and low exchange rates and their impact on the national economy, resolutely announced on November 4 the reform of the currency system, nationalizing silver, and making the banknotes of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications unlimited legal tender. The three banks were also allowed to buy and sell foreign exchange without restrictions to stabilize exchange rates.</p>
<p>From November to December, due to the circulation of legal tender, the money supply eased. The settlement period in October was also barely passed due to the Ministry of Finance's order to extend the period. The exchange rates announced by the Central Bank remained at the par value of November 4 until late December, and the previous drawbacks of sudden ups and downs had disappeared.</p>
<p>The problem of lack of funding has been largely resolved. The stable exchange rate alleviated the public's concerns about legal tender, and prices tended to rise. However, due to weak purchasing power, domestic industries still lacked vitality. In mid-December, the United States, because of China's currency reform, broke free from the shackles of the silver policy, and immediately stopped purchasing silver. The price of silver tended to fall again, and the price of gold soared again, returning to the chaotic state of early November. The financial panic has not yet turned around, and the scramble for monetary power by the great powers has entered a period of direct confrontation. Industry and commerce did not improve throughout the year, so the financial industry lost the function of turning over funds for business loans. It is expected that at the end of this year, there will definitely be many businesses that are too depressed to operate. This is due to the unsoundness of the silver and money industry itself, and is it not also the misfortune of industry and commerce?</p>
<p>The following are the average interbank lending rates for the whole year: (unit: fen)</p>
<p>II. Rise and Fall of the Silver and Money Industry</p>
<p>The 23rd year of the Republic (1934) was the most active year for banks in the country, with 20 new banks established, a record high in the past decade. Shanghai accounted for three-fifths of these 20 new banks. Among them, most were branches established in Shanghai from the inland areas, and Shanghai became a concentration area for banks.</p>
<p>The reason why the banking industry has developed so exceptionally is that in recent years, the decline of rural areas has concentrated funds in cities. Also, because of the development of speculation, the normal path of the financial industry supporting industry and commerce has been neglected. When the banking industry was at its peak, some people pointed out that this was a kind of malformed phenomenon, and it would inevitably lead to collapse. This prediction unfortunately came true in the year of the 24th Republic. Since Shanghai felt the panic of silver exports, land deeds, which accounted for a very large amount of Shanghai's financial funds (estimated at 200 million in 1930), suddenly lost their use. Silver and money industries, which generally owned a large amount of real estate, gradually created a situation of cash flow problems and property devaluation due to the sluggishness of real estate transactions and the reduction of land value. By the first half of the 24th year, they all showed embarrassment and had to tend towards bankruptcy or closure. Of course, the decline of industry and commerce, which made it impossible to recover the loans when they were due, and thus felt a cash flow problem, was also an important reason.</p>
<p>The currency contraction of the entire society also led to bank runs. When financial institutions were developing their business, they spared no effort to collect scattered deposits in order to engage in large-scale speculation and increase their profits. Unfortunately, during this period, the collected deposits either became bad debts, or turned into real estate, or were eroded due to improper use, resulting in their inability to cope with the depositors' bank runs. The closure of a few banks affected the collapse of the entire line. Financial institutions, which previously feared collecting too few deposits, now feared that too many deposits would be difficult to cope with.</p>
<p>Over the past year, the Shanghai silver and money industry has established a total of three commercial banks, one public bank, and closed 14 banks and eight money shops. They are now written down below: Three newly established commercial banks: Guoxin Bank, Yongda Bank, Jianhua Bank.</p>
<p>One newly established public bank: Zhejiang Local Bank. Fourteen closed banks: JiaHua Bank, Tongyi Bank,</p>
<p>Minghua Bank, Meifeng Bank, Ningbo Industrial Bank, Jiangnan Bank, Xiamen Bank, World Bank, Zhengda Bank, Guangdong Bank, Hong Kong National Bank, Xintong Bank, Dahut Bank, Huaye Bank. Eight closed money shops: Rongkangzhuang, Yikangzhuang, Baodayuzhuang, Dechangzhuang, Yintaizhuang, Yichangzhuang, Yongxingzhuang, Tongtaizhuang.</p>
<p>Among the above-mentioned newly established banks, the largest had a capital of 1 million yuan in national currency, and the smallest had 500,000 yuan. Among the closed banks, the largest had 11 million Hong Kong dollars and 5 million yuan in national currency, and the smallest had 100,000 yuan in national currency.</p>
<p>In addition, there were new banking facilities related to national finance, which was the increase of official shares in the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, and the merger of the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications to consolidate strength for the purpose of unifying control. During the most financial panic in the third quarter, the three banknote issuing banks, Siming Bank, China Industrial Bank, and China Tongshang Bank, were reorganized to increase their strength and assist in the construction of the national bank.</p>
<p>During the quarter from April to June, bank runs in various banks caused a panic of capital flight. At that time, the Bank of China was ordered to open a savings department to receive savings. In mid-October, the Central Trust Bureau was established to handle various trust businesses, and financial power was unified.</p>
<p>Therefore, although this year was a very bleak year for the silver and money industry itself, it can be said to be a success in terms of the government's control over finance.</p>
<p>III. Changes in Business Operations</p>
<p>In terms of business operations, a general idea can be obtained from the two aspects of deposits and loans.</p>
<p>The following figures are statistics from banks because there are no figures available for money shops. The figures for the end of the 23rd year of the Republic are estimated amounts, and the figures for the 24th year of the Republic are only the situation at the end of June.</p>
<p>In recent years, the deposits of various banks have gradually increased. One reason is that the development of banks has concentrated idle funds; another reason is that the decline of various old-fashioned financial organizations has concentrated funds in banks. The following are the deposit figures for the past 15 years: (unit: yuan)</p>
<p>The above figures show that the increase from the 23rd to the 24th year of the Republic was actually very small. If interest is excluded, the increase was only about 3 million yuan. What needs to be specially noted about the figure for the 24th year of the Republic is that it was during the Shanghai financial panic and the opening of the savings department of the Bank of China, so much of it was a transfer of credit. If the savings deposits of the Bank of China of 9 million yuan are removed, there is a downward trend.</p>
<p>The use of funds by various banks can be illustrated by mortgage loans and the purchase of marketable securities:</p>
<p>Both of these figures have also increased. In terms of the status of the two figures in the total operating amount, the highest percentage used for mortgage loans is 60% of the total operating amount, and the lowest is 12%. The highest percentage used to purchase marketable securities is 64%, and the lowest is 16%.</p>
<p>The increase in the number of loans is undoubtedly beneficial to the industrial and commercial sectors, but it is impossible to analyze in detail. However, from the banks' own point of view, the gradual development of their fund utilization in a more regulated manner is a somewhat satisfactory matter.</p>
<p>From another perspective, the panic in industry and commerce is deepening. The following is a statistic for the same period from January to June of the 23rd and 24th years of the Republic:</p>
<p>If we take the principle that the financial industry is the hub of all industries, then the decline in commodity prices, the decline of all industries, and the reduction in the deposits of the financial industry are undoubtedly true. The increase in loans is only a transfer of items, and its internal essence has not expanded.</p>
<p>In this year, there are three points that can be specially mentioned regarding the facilities in the financial sector:</p>
<p>Concentration of the power of the silver and money industry Apart from foreign banks, Shanghai's finance was originally divided into two major groups: banks and money shops. Smaller banks were subordinate to money shops. The money shops' clearing house (general association) and the banks' clearing house did not communicate with each other. After the financial turmoil in June of the 24th year of the Republic, both the silver and money industry felt that it was necessary to take a united step in order to cope with this serious situation. Therefore, the Money Industry Joint Reserve and the Bank Clearing House negotiated that all bills received by the money shops from the banks would be retained by the Money Industry Joint Reserve for collection; bills received by the banks from the money shops would also be retained by the Clearing House for collection. Among them, there were 55 money shop members on the money shop side and 37 Huichang Bank members on the bank side. From then on, the silver and money industry, which had always been divided, began to cooperate.</p>
<p>The government's relief to industry and commerce After the financial turmoil in the fourth and sixth seasons of the 24th year of the Republic, because of the decline of industry and commerce, the loans could not be repaid. Also, because the banks' settlement period was approaching, they felt that the funding was insufficient, so industry and commerce themselves and the money shops that lent to industry and commerce needed relief. At that time, the government announced measures to relieve the money industry and established the Industrial and Commercial Loan Committee to handle relief matters. The stability of the market after the autumn season cannot but be considered to have played an important role.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's exercise of its functions The Central Bank has increased its power in this year, especially after the merger of the three banks. During the autumn season of relief to industry and commerce, the Central Bank undertook a large amount of collateral and re-collateral. After the government managed the currency in November and unified the issuance, the power of the Central Bank was invisibly increased again. The Central Bank also has the power to buy and sell foreign exchange without restrictions. From then on, the Central Bank's foreign exchange listing price corrected the deformed state that had always been listed by foreign companies. At the same time, the acceptance of bills of exchange endorsed by the silver and money industry and the rediscount by the Central Bank have obviously facilitated the promotion. In addition, the establishment of the Central Trust Bureau and the promotion of savings by the state's power is of course much better than private banks.</p>
<p>IV. Future Prospects</p>
<p>The reason for the financial bleakness this year is still due to the shrinking of agriculture, industry, and commerce, the decline in commodity prices, the increase in unemployment, and political unrest. All kinds of reasons. In this way, the increase in wealth is already a difficult task, so it is naturally impossible to hope for an increase in the power of the financial industry.</p>
<p>Standing at the end of the 24th year of the Republic and looking to the future, the US silver policy, which is aggravating China's financial panic, has been alleviated by the currency reform. However, the United States, for this Eastern silver-using country that has escaped its cage, is constantly trying to show its power. The coercion of foreign currency forces is progressing.</p>
<p>There is no way to resist the dumping of surplus goods. The bankruptcy of domestic rural areas cannot reduce the import of necessities, and there are no exports to offset them. Although tung oil and silk were promoted in the second half of the 24th year of the Republic, they were only a flash in the pan and could not benefit the entire industry and commerce. Therefore, the dangerous situation at home and abroad is deepening day by day.</p>
<p>Shanghai holds the center of the country's finance, and in recent years, the decline of the country and political instability have reflected the weakness of urban finance. The rural population accounts for the majority of the country. To determine the future of China's finance, assuming that all conditions are good, it will still depend on the state of the countryside. Otherwise, I am afraid that even these idle finances will inevitably be included in the destruction.</p>
<h3>The Current Situation and Improvement of Shandong's Fishing Industry (Continued 3)</h3>
<p>— (Ding Fengbai)</p>
<p>Construction of Fish Markets. Fish markets are the hub for the concentration and distribution of seafood. That is, they accept consignment of goods from owners and sell them to fishmongers at a fair wholesale price for local consumption. On the other hand, they apply appropriate distribution based on the consumption situation in various areas of need, ensuring proper distribution and maintaining a balanced state. Therefore, fish markets must be built in consumer venues in large cities and must have port facilities to provide various conveniences to fishing boats. On the other hand, they must contact transportation agencies so that the fish caught can be sold smoothly in various places to regulate fish prices. Currently, the transaction of Shandong's fish is all handled by fishmongers of fish firms. All fish caught by fishermen are sold directly or indirectly by fish firms. For the sake of competing with peers and their own business, the fish firms do not hesitate to cut prices to compete for sales of fish obtained from the hard work of fishermen, just to get commissions. They have no time to take care of the livelihood of fishermen. Therefore, the fish firms have formed an organ that directly exploits fishermen. The construction of fish markets can eliminate this shortcoming: it uses the method of auction to obtain a fair high price, while the fish market itself only charges a small number of commissions to maintain its existence. This allows fishermen to exchange the products they have worked so hard for for a considerable price. In addition, the fish market can set up cold storage with extremely large capacity, which can be stored in it when there are too many fish imports to control the fall of the fish market and keep its price always balanced. (Note 14)</p>
<p>Establish Aquatic Schools. The failure of Shandong's fishing industry, the failure to adopt new fishing methods, and the poor manufacturing methods are also one of the reasons. The establishment of aquatic schools is to create a group of people who specialize in the fishing industry. In the future, specialized talents from aquatic schools can be used to preside over the fish industry. In this way, new fishing methods can be used to increase the production of fish and shellfish, and the manufacturing methods can be improved, so that fish products can reach the point where they are cheap and of good quality. If so, they can compete with foreign goods.</p>
<p>Establish a Fisheries Bank. Shandong's fishing industry has always lacked the organization of fisheries finance. Therefore, most of the capital of fishermen comes from loans from fish firms and fish merchants. Heavy profits and exploitation are just trivial matters. The biggest drawback is that if a fisherman borrows capital from a certain fish firm, all his fish catches must be sold by the fish firm. The fish merchants can manipulate and control the high and low fish prices, and the fishermen have no right to interfere. In this way, the fish merchants profit, and the fishermen are simply equal to cattle and horses. The establishment of the Fisheries Bank is mainly to inject capital into fishermen and implement low-profit loans to reduce the burden on fishermen. At the same time, fishermen have more active funds to engage in fishing.</p>
<p>Establish a Fishermen's Cooperative. The establishment of a fishermen's cooperative is entirely to seek the interests of the fishermen themselves under the conditions of mutual assistance. The use of this cooperative is entirely an organ representing the interests of the fishermen, so it should be presided over by the fishermen themselves and should not fall into the hands of ordinary fish merchants. In terms of business, the cooperative should form an organ for the guidance and mutual assistance of fishermen; at the same time, the Fisheries Bank should maintain close contact with the cooperative. If the bank wants to lend to fishermen, it is best to be controlled by the cooperative. The fishermen themselves can benefit directly, and the bank can also avoid a lot of trouble. The cooperative can also directly borrow a large amount of money from the bank to purchase a large number of suitable fishing boats and fishing gear for fishermen to rent, and charge the lowest rent.</p>
<p>Increase in Processing and Manufacturing. Increasing the benefits of processing and manufacturing aquatic products can regulate fish prices on the one hand, and promote sales on the other hand. For example, if aquatic products in a certain place are once overproduced, they can immediately be made into salted dry products or canned food for future needs, or transported to other places for sale. In this way, there will be no problem of goods being congested and fish prices plummeting in the area; at the same time, it is also a way to resist the dumping of imported goods. If several large-scale aquatic product manufacturing plants can be set up in several major fishing areas in Shandong, and scientific manufacturing methods are used, although imported goods are cheap and of good quality, I can still defeat them due to geographical convenience. (Note 15)</p>
<p>Improvement of Transportation and Sales. After the establishment of large-scale aquatic product manufacturing plants, the second step is to improve transportation and sales. Because any kind of commodity must be promoted for sales, its purpose is not only to promote production and regulate the balance, but also to avoid the problem of goods being congested in one place and causing prices to plummet. Shandong is relatively developed in both water and land transportation, but what needs to be improved in transportation and sales is the creation of refrigerated trains and refrigerated ships. This creation is very important for the transportation of aquatic products to distant places, especially for the transportation of aquatic products such as fresh fish, which cannot be transported without refrigerated equipment. In addition, the establishment of a fisheries transportation company is also necessary in fact.</p>
<p>Improvement of Taxes. Abolishing exorbitant taxes and redrafting tax rules are also necessary conditions for reforming Shandong's fishing industry. If exorbitant taxes are not abolished, the production and smooth sales of aquatic products will be hindered. As a result, fish prices will rise, sales will stagnate, and production will therefore not develop. The abolition of exorbitant taxes has already begun in several fishing areas in Shandong, and considerable results have been achieved. The redrafting of tax rules should be implemented now, or we will only see foreign goods flooding the market, and our own fishing economy will have no way to revitalize. On the contrary, it will only go bankrupt day by day. "Spinning a cocoon and binding oneself," who is to blame?</p>
<p>The above ten items are just an outline of a reform plan. As for how to implement and proceed, it is the responsibility of the government authorities and fishery experts.</p>

<h3>Securities Request for Foreign Exchange - Many Sell Bonds</h3>
<p>Last week (December 23rd to 28th), the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange had the last day of trading for December, and trading for February began. With a three-day holiday in between, the market situation already showed signs of decline. Initially, there was a short squeeze, but then many long positions were unloaded, and financial institutions sold off. Aside from a few covering short positions, there were very few new buyers. The selling pressure was as intense as the buying frenzy before. Selling and buying back and forth, constantly changing, whether pushing up or pulling down, all served the same purpose. The enthusiasm for speculation was partly due to the poor economic environment and partly due to tight credit conditions. After the scheduled delivery of January futures on January 31st, 1936, a precedent was unexpectedly set by opening the exchange. The weaknesses of long positions were already exposed. As I mentioned before, this can now be proven. Therefore, the previous rise was because long positions believed they had a rare commodity, but now, with the fall, they will face the difficulty of not being able to sell. First, "Golden Gang" began to sell, gradually turning short. Then, financial institutions sold off. This is still in the early stages of significant change. Watching the strong selling pressure from large investors, following one after another, the future is still worrisome. Rumors in the market about bond interest rate reductions are just speculation. The only real danger is that after the fall of American banks, some capitalists and financial institutions are buying foreign exchange and selling government bonds, which is an unavoidable fact. Investors should pay attention to this. Last week, except for Wednesday, which was the Yunnan Uprising commemoration, and Thursday and Friday, which were the December futures delivery, the market was closed for three days. There were only three actual trading days. Monday was the last day for December futures, and "Golden Gang" continued to sell, creating a short squeeze. Numbers 43 and 48, etc., took the lead, selling off small amounts, earning up to one yuan or more. On Tuesday, only January futures were traded for one month, and selling pressure remained strong. Although there were buyers, the imbalance between supply and demand continued, falling by two, three cents to seven or eight cents. The market was closed from Wednesday to Friday. On Saturday, trading in February futures began, and selling pressure was strong, mainly from financial institutions. As a result, except for December, which was relatively strong due to only one day of trading, January fell by several cents to three yuan and seven or eight cents. The largest drop was in "Golden Short." The total transaction volume was only 84,165,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed below: (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan)</p>
<p>New York Stocks Even Out</p>
<p>Sinfeng Foreign Company reports that yesterday (28th), the New York stock market was the last day for calculating income tax gains and losses. Various parties evened out their positions, with a slight outflow. At the same time, due to the holidays, many speculators also began to sell. Prices varied slightly, declining slightly. Stock prices on smaller exchanges saw mixed ups and downs. The bond market was calm, with a half-day trading volume of 1.14 million shares.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn - American Cotton Sales Predominate</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened quietly. Prices for all months fell by two to six points. Trading in the market was mostly for settlements and rollovers. Prices were weak due to the liquidation of long positions and selling from the South and foreign merchants. However, there was some demand from industry players and brokers. Afterwards, the market situation was peaceful. Short sellers bought March and May contracts and sold October contracts. Finally, short covering caused the market to rebound. Spot prices remained unchanged, near-term prices fell by one to two points, and deferred prices rose by two to four points. British cotton spot and futures both fell by one point. Indian cotton was closed. The original telegram is recorded on the left. (Telegraph dated 28th).</p>
<p>According to a telegram from Bombay, the opening forecast for White Rosie cotton on the 30th was 217.5 rupees, up half a rupee from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Food - Wheat Delivery Not Yet Complete - Foreign Firm Sesame Sales Still Low -</h3>
<p>December wheat has not yet been fully delivered. It is said that a large amount of 33 cars are outstanding, but as of yesterday, only 22 cars have been officially delivered. Those delivering included Dingtai (16 cars) and Houde (6 cars). Those receiving included Jinji (2 cars) and Sinfeng (10 cars). Most of the goods were Hankou wheat. There were only two or three cars of Jiangnanbei goods. The delivery of standard sesame was also a large amount of four to five hundred tons. Those delivering were Sinfengtai, Runrencheng, Wanxing and other firms. Those receiving were Dache and other firms. As for the sales of foreign firms, it is said that they are still active. However, the source of supply is also quite smooth. Coupled with the exchange's responsibility for the safe storage of sesame, both buyers and sellers say it is convenient.</p>
<p>Overseas wheat exports from Russia and the Southern Hemisphere have decreased, which has emboldened long positions. However, public interest is very low. The situation in Winnipeg is lagging behind.</p>
<p>River Rice Drops Slightly</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 20 sources from various gangs (totaling more than 5,000) stones. Sales in this street were even slower, and the market was weak. Houzaogeng fell by 5 cents to 1 dime. The Hakka buyers of Bo rice still handled around 2,000 bags, and the market price was stable. Retail sales also showed signs of weakness. Du Yangjian and Yinbianyuan saw no change in prices, and the situation felt flat and weak.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than 40 sources from various routes downstream. The market's appetite for various goods was weak because the end of the lunar year was approaching and shops were closing accounts. Both shops' appetite and stockpiling were weak. The market price of Bai Geng high-quality materials was barely standing, and medium-quality prices were weak and cut off outside the corners. Early rice followed, weakening by nearly a dime. Bo rice was also a small angle. Yangbu Jian was weak by a small number of points. Bai Yuan prices were adjusted near a foot. Hakka Jian had a weak trend, and the rest of the goods were all about a dime lower.</p>
<p>(Retail Price) Yesterday, the municipal rice industry publicly agreed on the retail price of rice as follows:</p>
<h3>Finance - Guangjiao Dark Market Better by Five Li</h3>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Yan Maode)</p>
<p>Time passes second by second, so life is getting shorter and shorter. Therefore, we should tighten the reins, work hard, and not allow any time to be wasted. The writer Lermontov said, "Time is our warhorse, a warhorse that gallops swiftly." This saying can be our motto.</p>
<p>As the Western proverb says, "A bad decision is better than no decision at all." Hesitating and being at a loss when encountering things will not only miss opportunities, but often lead to debts. People must have resolute decisions.</p>
<p>"Things in the world are often unsatisfactory in eight or nine out of ten cases." In today's society, at any time and any place, we can be subjected to significant stimulation. But we need stimulation, just as life needs air. An adverse environment is a good place for us to create a hopeful life. As the saying goes, "Only by enduring the hardships can one become a superior person." Abundant fruits are originally hidden in thorny bushes.</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt's Health Regimen</h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>The current American President Roosevelt attaches great importance to hygiene. He exercises for 1 hour and 15 minutes every day, sleeps for 8 hours every night, and has breakfast in bed every morning. He has followed these simple health methods for many years, so he feels very healthy. This was taught to him by his physician, Navy Captain McIntyre. According to McIntyre, everyone should follow this habit. President Roosevelt's exercise regimen includes swimming for 20 minutes at least five nights a week, and he often massages his whole body after exercise. This is done after finishing work and before dinner. President Roosevelt always goes to bed before midnight and has breakfast in bed at 8:00 a.m. In the evening, when there are no government affairs to discuss, he spends his time reading and collecting stamps. Sometimes he watches movies, because there is a private small movie theater in the White House. All the best new films released by various companies are always sent to the White House for screening. According to McIntyre, President Roosevelt's health has never been as good as it is now. McIntyre also said that President Roosevelt never orders specific meals but eats whatever he likes. His spirit is strong, and he works tirelessly. He suffered from polio in his childhood, which lasted for many years, but today the root of the disease has been completely removed. This is largely due to his strong willpower. He believed that if this disease were to plague him, his life's work would be ruined, so he worked hard and fought against the disease and achieved victory. The four words "self-improvement without ceasing" can be offered to President Roosevelt.</p>
<h3>Temptation</h3>
<p>— Lanshan</p>
<p>If you walk to that cultural street—a nickname for Simalu Qipan Street—near the alleyways, and if you are a young lad, there will definitely be an old "gun" who is good at reading faces who will come over and tempt you in the most pleasant low voice: "Do you want to buy a set of newly released Spring ×?" If you walk forward without saying a word, he won't drag you. If you glance at him or let out some sound between your teeth, he will pester you and run a few steps with you, saying even more moving things in his mouth, not stopping until he leads you into the alley and completes his illicit little business.</p>
<p>Readers must know that what he is selling is not something else, but those pornographic pictures that are most harmful to people. These immoral old "guns" are specifically attacking young friends, completely exploiting young people's curiosity. Once young people have provoked him, they have to buy his paintings; after buying them, the father will have one more worry—both mentally and physically, all are unavoidable.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the authorities will strictly investigate and ban these old "guns" and save those young people who have not yet been exposed to humanity and are full of vigor!</p>
<h3>Idle Talk about Goldfish</h3>
<p>— Aimei</p>
<p>In the past, I had a passion for goldfish and often consulted ancient books so that I could follow the illustrations and search for different species. Now that I am checking my travel trunk, old drafts are still there, so I will transcribe a few items for reference by those with the same hobby.</p>
<p>"Qunfangpu": "There are several types of goldfish: carp, crucian carp, loach, and turtle. Loach and turtle are certainly difficult to obtain, only goldfish are durable... They are initially black, then turn red after a long time, and may also turn white, called silver fish. Some have three tails, some have five tails, and some even have seven tails."</p>
<p>"Yangyujing": "Five-colored ornamental fish have inherently different colors, and goldfish are just a general name. Initially, they are pure red, pure white, red cheeks, and red caps; then, they are snow eyes, pearl eyes, purple eyes, agate eyes, and amber eyes; then, they are twelve reds, twenty-six reds; and even so-called twelve hundreds, and piled gold and jade, falling flowers and flowing water, isolating the red dust, and lotus pedestal eight petals; the names are various." Also: "Divine products all come from flowery fish, and future changes are beyond description! And the red head species are completely ordinary." Also: "Eyes are prized for being red and protruding; however, one must not be bound by this, or there will be no goldfish. Furthermore, red dislikes yellow, and white dislikes wax." Also: "Three-tailed and four-tailed varieties, the tails are originally of one type, the body material is close to stagnant, and the colors are all bright, which can be considered their quality. However, gold tubes, silver tubes, Guangling, Xindu, and Gusu compete to treasure them."</p>
<p>"Shantang Skao": "Goldfish, also known as fire fish, the colors are all different; under Biji Mountain, there is a cave, inside there are gold thread fish, and in Zhongdu there are gold coin fish, snowy texture with black patterns, distinct like millet, just like hawksbill turtle, the patterns are particularly worth seeing."</p>
<p>"Zhengzitong": "Goldfish, there is one in Ji'an that has five colors, called hand towel fish."</p>
<p>"Min Shu": "There are several types of goldfish, and the gold hoop fish is the best; there is also the inch gold fish."</p>
<p>"Yue Zhi": "When goldfish bite their eggs, cover them with large shrimp to produce more shrimp tails; also, those with leaves scattered like hibiscus are good, called hibiscus tail." Note: I have tried this method and it is as said.</p>
<p>I also remember ancient people's famous lines about goldfish, scraps of light and feathers, which are also precious. Such as Cai Yu's poem: "The ancient cliff is a green screen, the ice pot gold carp is red." Ma Yulin's poem: "Entering and exiting the micro-waves, the clouds are like slices, spitting and swallowing the fine rain, the brocade is like scales." Xu Zhonghang's poem: "Zhu Lin shoots the red sun, the fire mane runs the gold." Wang Zhiden's poem: "The curtains are lonely, the rain is oblique, an inch of gold scales is like red sand." Gui Youguang's poem: "A spoonful of water stops in a deep pool, a square pond is free to meander." Also, Su Shi's poem "Revisiting West Lake": "I recognize the gold crucian carp of Nanping, and I come again to stroke the railing to disperse the remaining sadness." Wu Guolun's palace poem: "The fragrance of the tender lotus floats to the fishing pavilion, the ornamental fish on the water form a line." All of these are enough to enhance the color of goldfish.</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Two: A Knightly Word Moves Rosy Lips, A Group of Beauties Discuss; False Emotion Startles Jade Wrists, A Distressed Woman Escapes Imprisonment</p>
<p>There was something very strange here, and that was that the complainant, Miss Yueying, remained hidden inside the house and did not come out, as if such a great commotion had nothing to do with her. Mrs. Zhou stood in the crowd in the overhall and looked around for a while, and then said; Where is this Miss Zhu? How come she herself is unwilling to show her face. With just this sentence, two female guests pushed and pulled her out. That Miss Yueying was rather embarrassed, and lowered her head, refusing to look up. Mrs. Zhou said; Miss Zhu, you don't need to be afraid. Don't you see us arguing with him like this? If he was truly right, if we were arguing with him like this, he would have pushed us away long ago. Look, now not only can he not push us away, but we have driven him away. Taking advantage of this opportunity, you should leave quickly. Yueying raised her head and smiled. Immediately, she straightened her expression again, and said: How dare I leave like this? We are poor people and live nearby. If he reports to the authorities and has my whole family imprisoned, where will we go to seek redress? Mrs. Zhou pointed at Mrs. Lan and said: This is the Special Commissioner's wife. If you report to the authorities, her Special Commissioner will come out to take charge. Yueying had heard about the Special Commissioner for a whole day and night, and she had a good impression in her mind. Wasn't she the woman who cried upstairs last night and lost her temper? How could she be so compassionate today, showing kindness and helping people? Thinking this in her heart, her eyes couldn't help but glance at Mrs. Lan again and again. She only saw her standing behind a group of ladies, with a smug look on her face, lightly patting her chest and saying: If he wants to report you to the authorities, just say that I dragged you out, and if the official wants to deal with someone, deal with us. Yueying looked at everyone again, without saying a word. However, her gaze swept across the faces of this group of ladies, and then swept across the face of Wang Beihai, who was flipping through a newspaper at the newspaper table. Beihai couldn't help but raise his head slightly and glance at her, and unexpectedly, at this moment, the two of them looked at each other. Yueying did not expect that Beihai would still be waiting here, so two large red clots appeared on her cheeks. None of the ladies here would have thought that she had another young man in her heart, so they still surrounded Yueying like stars around the moon. (385)</p>
<p>Exclusive Interview by This Publication</p>
<h3>An Interview with Mr. Jiang Kanghu</h3>
<p>— Yimei</p>
<p>Dr. Jiang Kanghu has a special interest in traveling. Recently, he returned from the Northwest and retired to Shanghai, residing in Qingliang Temple in the Xin family garden. I had not seen him for more than half a year, so I went to visit him yesterday. Upon arriving at the temple, Dr. Jiang received me warmly and asked about my situation after our separation, very sincerely. His spirit was as good as ever, without any sign of travel weariness, which shows his usual cultivation. Dr. Jiang said, "This trip covered five provinces, but the most impressive was going out of the pass to Inner Mongolia. I visited Bailing Temple, a magnificent building in that area. Prince De and Prince Fu specially ordered their subordinates to play triumphal music to entertain guests. The triumphal music is a piece composed by Genghis Khan. Its sound is intense and moving, but in front of it is Daughter Mountain, a chaotic and desolate desert, with a sad sunset. Facing this scene, I felt a hundred emotions and could not control myself. The Mongolians' most respectful etiquette is the whole sheep banquet, roasting a whole sheep and eating it while cutting it. Wooden bowls and bone chopsticks are extraordinarily simple, accompanied by scorched millet, without the use of pure wine." Dr. Jiang also mentioned a string of prayer beads, the luster of which was particularly unique. Looking at it, Dr. Jiang said, "This is a Star Moon Bodhi seed produced in Xikang, given to me by Zen Master Chao Yi from Sichuan." He pointed out that each seed has a small hole and countless black spots surrounding it, like a crowd of stars surrounding the moon. It is completely natural, without human intervention, and is certainly precious and pleasing. Upon parting, I was given his recently published "Glimpses of Jiang Kanghu's Thought" in Beijing, which contains many discussions about culture. The most convincing thing to me was that "All the relics of Chinese culture, the first step is to unconditionally respect and preserve them, the second step is to use a world perspective and scientific methods to comparatively study, analyze and organize them, and the third step is to maximize their advantages and try to supplement their shortcomings. Only in this way will Chinese culture be a living culture, not a dead culture; have universality, and also have a future; but those who are not proficient in other cultures and cannot apply modern culture cannot undertake this responsibility and complete this mission. Therefore, on the one hand, we should cooperate with European and American cultural scholars, and on the other hand, we should promote Chinese culture to the world." Impartial and moderate, it is truly a middle-of-the-road talk. It is said that Dr. Jiang plans to stay in Shanghai for a month or two, meeting guests in the morning and writing books in the afternoon. He will then go to Pingdu to spend the end of the year, and he is thinking of visiting the old man Ma Xiangbo soon to discuss the separation of twenty years.</p>

<h3>Winter Disease Prevention Methods</h3>
<p>— Zhu Qingyun</p>
<p>The weather is so cold, and it is easy to get sick if you are not careful. In addition, the wind is strong and the sky is dry, and the skin is prone to cracking or frostbite, which not only causes physical pain but also mental pain that cannot be cried out. In wealthy families that are well taken care of, there are still servants to be ordered; poor people suffer unspeakable hardships when they get sick. Therefore, as the saying goes, "A poor man's body is a rich man's money." Poor people need a healthy body to work hard and struggle for a living, to make a living. Therefore, it is essential to understand some common knowledge about disease prevention. The following prevention methods, although worthless, are all effective methods based on actual experience.</p>
<p>Frostbite Prevention Cold weather easily causes blood to stagnate, so frostbite is a common skin disease among ordinary people. Although it is a minor illness, it is difficult to recover until the earth returns to spring and the climate is warm after it has become ulcerated. One winter is enough to be distressing. The cause of frostbite is mostly due to lack of exercise, so laborers are less likely to get frostbite; the reason is that it is related to the skeleton. Therefore, the main way to prevent frostbite is to work hard and exercise, so that the blood in the affected area is constantly flowing rapidly. Then frostbite will not occur at all. The second is to keep warm. At the location where frostbite occurs, keep it warm early. For example, on frostbitten feet, immediately change to cotton shoes when the weather turns cold. Under this defense, if you still feel itchy, quickly dip new cotton in kerosene. First wash the affected area with hot water, and while it is hot, wipe the affected area with the kerosene-soaked cotton, and then wrap it with dry cotton to prevent it from getting cold. (It is best to do this before going to bed.) This will at most four or five times, and the affected area will wrinkle and disperse. As for after it has ulcerated, it is not easy to cure. Although there are many kinds of frostbite medicines sold on the market, I have not yet tested and judged whether they are effective.</p>
<p>Cough Prevention In the cold season, the air outside is so cold, and some people in the room have a stove; in an environment where the cold and heat are not adjusted, it is easy to catch a cold and cough if you are not careful. The way to prevent it is to pay attention to the warmth of your clothes, mainly to keep them slightly warm. If you catch a cold and cough, there are also several effective prescriptions: for a more expensive one, mash raw almonds into juice, add rock sugar, and cook into almond juice; the best way is to dig out the core of a raw pear, add Sichuan fritillary and rock sugar, and steam the rock sugar into syrup on the rice pot; or boil winter melon seeds and rock sugar into a soup, drink it before going to bed, and then cover yourself with a quilt and sweat, and you will naturally recover.</p>
<p>Sore Throat Prevention In cold weather, people are prone to being close to the stove, and hot pots and other things mostly use charcoal fire. The weather is cold and the air is dry, and people's throats often become sore and cracked due to the dryness of the fire. The best way to prevent it is to imitate Europeans and Americans by eating a Western meal and eating an orange or a raw pear after eating. If the fruit is expensive, it is cheaper to eat some raw radish, and raw radish shreds and salted radish are still good dishes that can prevent diseases and go well with porridge and rice, which can be called a win-win situation. As for the most convenient treatment after a sore throat occurs, put some salt on the red and swollen area of the throat, and otherwise drink some salt water or Qing olive soup. If it is not diphtheria, it is easy to recover.</p>

<h3>Fourth National Physicians' Representatives Conference Work Report (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xu Naili</p>
<p>I. Implementation of Resolutions from the Third National Representatives Conference</p>
<p>Sixty-three proposals were put forward at the previous conference. Of these, proposals Yi No. 17, 41, 46, 49, and 59 were withdrawn by the original proposers. Proposals Yi No. 25, 26, 39, and 55 were resolved to be withdrawn by the conference. Proposals Yi No. 24, 27, and 57 were resolved to be rejected. Proposal Yi No. 53 was resolved to be approved in principle, with the specific methods to be discussed at the next conference. The three temporary proposals were reserved for discussion at the next conference due to lack of time. The remaining forty-seven proposals have been implemented in accordance with the resolutions passed at the time. Reports have been submitted at each joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, and published in the "Conference Affairs" section of the Medical Affairs Bulletin. Recently, a summary table has been prepared and published in Issue 4 of Volume 7 of the Medical Affairs Bulletin, which I believe you have all seen. Now, I will elaborate on the key points for your consideration:</p>
<p>Regarding the proposals to enhance the authority of physicians' associations and the principles of the Physicians' Association Law, Yi No. 1, 9, 23, 52, and 60, although the conference resolutions did not specify a merger, the Executive Committee determined that they were completely related. Therefore, the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Executive Committee resolved to compile the proposals, record historical opinions and facts regarding the Physicians' Association Law, and distribute them to various regions to solicit opinions. After being sent out in the winter of the 23rd year, over half a year, responses were continuously received from various parties, expressing opinions based on the draft Physicians' Association Law of the former Ministry of Health, for consideration by the authorities. Subsequently, all executive and supervisory committee members carefully annotated them, and recently, the standing committee members have organized them into a final form. It seems that national public opinion is already consistent. However, for the sake of prudence, the opinions of the Second Plenary Joint Meeting of the Third Executive and Supervisory Committees are being resubmitted to this conference for discussion.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposals to organize resolutions from past conferences and urge the government to implement the association's recommendations, Yi No. 5, 16, and 56, the Standing Committee had instructed the staff to organize them diligently according to the conference's intentions. As a result, a summary table was prepared and presented to the Executive Committee for discussion. The recommendations were compiled into a written opinion and submitted to the Health Department at the beginning of the 24th year for adoption (full text published in Issue 1 of Volume 7 of the Medical Affairs Bulletin). The response received was "saved for reference." Other proposals, except those that were time-sensitive, were implemented separately, and the implementation process, along with the resolutions of past conferences, was listed and published in Issues 3 and 4 of Volume 7 of the Medical Affairs Bulletin, which can be considered a conclusion. What is most regrettable is that the proposals to urge the government to implement them were often shelved without action (such as the "Outline for Medical Affairs Construction and Implementation," which was drafted and reviewed several times, and submitted to the Executive Yuan in March of the 24th year for adoption, but has remained silent ever since, as can be seen from this). Even if a response was received, it was only a superficial statement with no responsible commitment. This has been a long-standing practice in officialdom and is not unique to our medical association. Therefore, in order to urge the government to implement the association's recommendations, apart from private contacts, no suitable channel has been found to date, and it is truly felt that we have failed to meet the expectations of all members.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposals to suggest that the Ministry of Education and the Health Department pay close attention to health education (Yi No. 35, 37, and 50), in the summer of the 23rd year, the four propositions resolved by the conference were: 1. Request the Ministry of Education to organize a health education committee; 2. Request the drafting committee of curriculum standards for primary and secondary school textbooks to participate in the review of textbooks; 3. Request the Health Department to prepare more health education materials; 4. Request the Ministry of Education to issue a circular to educational institutions to actively improve health facilities and the environment, and handle health care matters. After submitting a written request, the Ministry of Education replied that a design committee for health education in primary and secondary schools had been organized, and health education materials had been clearly stipulated in the curriculum standards for primary and secondary schools. The Health Department replied that, apart from the preparation of health education materials, which would be actively handled by this department, the scope of the Ministry of Education had been transferred to the department for review. Thus, this proposal has achieved considerable results.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposals on midwifery education and treatment (Yi No. 13 and 21), experts were appointed by the Fourth Plenary Session of the Third Executive Committee to repeatedly discuss them based on the conference's review report. The results were summarized into eleven items in June of the 24th year and submitted to the Ministry of Education and the Health Department for comments. At that time, the midwifery schools in Shanghai were petitioning about the new regulations promulgated by the Ministry and sent representatives to Beijing. It was rumored that the authorities had verbally indicated that they would adopt the association's opinions. However, no official reply has been received to date. The degree to which they will be adopted remains to be seen in the future.</p>
<p>Regarding the establishment of a pathological anatomy association and the honoring of Mr. Yu Ziwei (Yi No. 8 and 12), this has been handled in accordance with the conference resolution. However, during the process, the original member appointed to draft the charter of the Pathological Anatomy Association, Committee Member Pang Jingzhou, went abroad for investigation, and collecting the deeds of Yu Ziwei took a lot of time. Therefore, the charter of the association was only made public in November of the 24th year, and Mr. Yu's commemorative album was only recently issued as an attachment to Issue 4 of Volume 7 of the Medical Affairs Bulletin. As for the formal establishment of the association, it is expected to be soon. The original initiators are soliciting comrades, and we hope that the entire association will work together to promote it.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposals to organize an emergency service guarantee committee and a talent introduction and medical service design committee (Yi No. 28, and 3, 36, and 42), after being approved by the conference, the Executive Committee repeatedly discussed them and believed that medical disputes should be handled according to past practice. In special circumstances, a specialized committee could be organized to resolve them. During these two years, the organization of this committee has been resolved four times, such as the Qiu case in Hangzhou, the Gu case in Changshu, and the Wang and Wei cases in Wuhu, etc. This will be reported in detail later. As for the talent introduction and medical service design committee, the charter has been revised and announced by the Second Plenary Joint Meeting of the Third Executive and Supervisory Committees, and standing committee members have been temporarily appointed as permanent committee members by the Twenty-First Plenary Session of the Third Executive Committee to be responsible for the implementation.</p>
<p>Regarding the proposals to organize new drugs and promote the establishment of medical equipment and machinery factories (Yi No. 15, 30, and 31), the conference resolved to cooperate with the New Drug Organization Committee of the Shanghai Physicians' Association. Subsequently, the Second Plenary Session of the Third Executive Committee appointed Chen Fangzhi, Xie Yunshou, and Wu Jihua to participate. However, due to situational factors, the work of the Shanghai committee was delayed, so there are no achievements to report.</p>
<p>Other cases include: 1. Establishing popular lecture halls (Yi No. 2), adopting domestically produced medical supplies (Yi No. 4), prohibiting illegal abortions (Yi No. 19), standardizing weights and measures (Yi No. 20), and abolishing national prefixes (Yi No. 32). All five proposals have been notified to various associations and groups for implementation. 2. Establishing more autopsy centers (Yi No. 10), compiling and reviewing hygiene books using the same terminology (Yi No. 33), inspecting imported foreign drugs (Yi No. 40), and doctors should hire formal physicians (Yi No. 51), and managing foreign physicians (Yi No. 58). All five proposals have been submitted to the主管官署, and their responses have been received, so they are not ignored. 3. 各縣 Increase the number of sanitary technicians, stipulate sanitary expenses, and stipulate the qualifications of sanitary personnel (Yi No. 7, 22, 44, 48, 54, etc.) These have been incorporated into the association's opinion letter to the Health Department at the beginning of the 24th year, and the reply was "saved for reference." 4. Canceling the temporary regulations for registering clinics in Hankou (Yi No. 47). Although the Health Department was strongly urged at the Second Plenary Session, the result was not very satisfactory.</p>
<p>Finally, it must be reported that (1) Prohibiting the abuse of injections and surgery (Yi No. 6, 14), increasing medical specialist schools (Yi No. 11, 29), establishing a sanitary police training institute (Yi No. 18), medical texts should be mainly in Chinese (Yi No. 34), strictly enforcing poison regulations (Yi No. 38), and issuing a circular to local governments not to regulate consultation fees (Yi No. 45). All have been submitted to the主管當局 for implementation. (2) Exploring and researching domestic drugs to recover profit rights (Yi No. 43) has also been sent to the Health Experiment Office of the Economic Committee for handling. The matter is extremely important, but unfortunately, no reply has been received. Therefore, colleagues feel guilty and acknowledge that the implementation has been ineffective.</p>
<p>II. Process of Handling the Association's Registration</p>
<p>The association has been established for six years. Initially, due to the lack of clear regulations on the affiliated system, repeated requests were made to higher-level agencies for registration, but were repeatedly rejected. After the promulgation of the People's Organization Law, an application was made to the Shanghai Special City Party Department for registration based on the provisions. However, the order from the Central Government to suspend registration suddenly came down, and it was delayed. In the summer of the 23rd year, it was heard that the previous order had been revoked, and another request was submitted to the City Party Department, asking for accommodation and supplementary filing. The procedures were cumbersome and time-consuming, so the approval order was not received until New Year's Eve. At the same time, according to the provisions of the organization law, the association's seal was redesigned in accordance with the regulations. Therefore, on New Year's Day of the 24th year, a notice was issued to start using the new seal. However, this was only a preliminary step. According to the law, after approval, the City Party Department should send someone to inspect and issue a sound instruction before being allowed to apply to the主管官署 for filing. Unexpectedly, the People's Training Committee of the Central Party Department suddenly ordered me to change the name to the National Federation of Physicians' Associations and to join the old medical groups for reorganization. A sudden wave arose, and the registration issue felt distant again. Subsequently, a written explanation was given, detailing the difficult situation, and requesting the Party Department to forward it. The exchange of official documents was also very troublesome. Fortunately, understanding was finally won, and permission was granted to continue as before last autumn. Only then did this come to an end. Subsequently, a request was resubmitted in accordance with the law, so the sound instruction was received in November of last winter. Applications were then submitted to the Executive Yuan Health Department and the Ministry of Interior for filing. Although approvals were obtained in a short period of time, it took a lot of time before and after, and it was not easy.</p>
<p>III. Process of Handling Medical Dispute Cases</p>
<p>There have been seven medical dispute litigation cases in the past two years. A summary report is given below:</p>
<p>The case of Dr. Qiu Boxun, a member of the Hangzhou Physicians' Association, being falsely accused of causing the death of Wang Xuefei, and the initial trial was deemed inappropriate, and a request was made to review the case. Experts Liu Yixiang, Zhou Jingwen, Chen Fangzhi, Yu Lin, and Luo Chuanrong were appointed in March of the 23rd year to review the case. Based on the experts' opinions, a letter was sent to the Zhejiang Provincial High Court for reference. It was later heard that the second trial resulted in acquittal, which was said to be justice in the world. Unexpectedly, last year, the Supreme Court sent it back for retrial, and the retrial did not result in justice. Therefore, in September, the original experts were requested to review the case again. Although a written opinion has been submitted to the Supreme Court, the outcome is unknown and worthy of attention.</p>
<p>The case of Dr. Yin Leren of Nantong Leren Hospital being falsely accused by a patient's family. After receiving the report, the association sent a letter to the Nantong District Court in August of the 23rd year, requesting a copy of the litigation documents for research. Unexpectedly, no reply was received, and the case had already been decided, fining Dr. Yin 1,000 yuan, which was shocking. Later, an appeal to the Jiangsu Higher Court resulted in acquittal.</p>
<p>The Changshu Physicians' Association sent a case of Ms. Gu Zhihe, an obstetrician in the area, being sued, requesting academic research. Experts Jin Wenhong, Qu Shaohang, and Lin Huizhen were appointed in August of the 23rd year to review the case, and the review opinions were sent back. It is heard that this case has had a considerable result as a result.</p>
<p>The Wuhu Physicians' Association reported that member Zhong Shouzhi was unreasonably accused by a patient's family and requested that justice be upheld. Because the entire file was not sent in the beginning, a letter was sent in October of the 23rd year to request a supplement. It was later heard that Dr. Zhong was declared not guilty, and the nurse of the hospital was sentenced to a small amount of justice. Therefore, in September of last year, experts Song Guobin, Gu Yuqi, Xia Shenchu, Liu Zhigang, and Shen De were appointed to review the case. Opinions were immediately drafted and sent to the Anhui Higher Court for reference, to uphold academic principles and defend the innocent.</p>
<p>The Nanchang Medical Association sent a letter stating that the judgments in the cases of doctors Jiang Ming and Liu Maochun were inappropriate and requested support. At that time, because academic groups had already researched the two cases, it was clear that there was no negligence in the academic theory. Therefore, the Standing Committee submitted it for review on March 5 of last year and compiled the similarities between the two cases into an opinion letter and sent it to the Jiangxi Higher Court for support.</p>
<p>In Guangzhou, member Xi Jiaqi of the Guangzhou Physicians' Association was falsely accused by the Jiang family in Guangxi. In May of last year, experts Yu Lin, Zhang Zhiguo, and Xie Yunshou were appointed to review the case, and an opinion letter was drafted and sent directly to the Guangxi Higher Court for reference.</p>
<p>Recently, the Wuhu Physicians' Association sent the case file of Dr. Wei Wenba being accused. Although the litigation has been going on for many years and the case is complicated, the evidence regarding the poisoning part was improperly collected, and there are questionable points in academic theory.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>Therefore, in October of last year, experts Chen Fangzhi, Liu Zhigang, and Shen De were appointed to review the case, and they submitted their opinions to the Anhui Higher Court for reference.</p>
<p>In addition, it should be reported that the number of medical dispute cases has been increasing year by year, and practicing physicians lack legal protection, which is not a blessing for the community. Therefore, at the 13th Executive Committee meeting of the Third Session on January 25 of last year, it was resolved to investigate medical dispute cases across the country in order to compile and study them, understand the crux of the problem, and seek a fundamental solution. The received cases have been published separately in the Medical Affairs Bulletin. In the future, it is planned to ask all members to cooperate and collect them on behalf of the association in preparation for the organization of a specialized committee to review and discuss them in the future.</p>
<h3>On the Changes in Legal Thought and Their Impact on the Medical System</h3>
<p>— Wang Qizhang</p>
<p>In ancient times, emperors ruled the world, and all belonged to the emperor. National laws were family laws. The Book of Documents states, "If there are crimes in all directions, the fault lies with me." Han Feizi said, "If the ruler cannot clarify the law and uses it to control the prestige of ministers, he will gain the trust of petty men who have no virtue. If the ruler abandons the law and uses ministers to guard against ministers, then those who love each other will form factions and praise each other, and those who hate each other will form cliques and slander each other. If praise and slander compete, the ruler will be confused. If ministers do not seek fame and promotion through requests, they will have no way to advance. If they do not rely on the law and exclusive control, they will have no prestige. If they do not pretend to be loyal and trustworthy, they will have no way to prohibit. These three are the resources for a昏主 to destroy the law." From this, we know that the so-called law in the imperial era was merely the licentious power of the ruler and the deceitfulness of the ministers. History says that when Han Gao entered the customs, he made three laws with the elders, which seemed to be an expression of accepting public opinion and breaking away from the imperial object. In fact, it was nothing more than a tactic to win people's hearts. Therefore, the political system, the ideology, and the laws of our country have been like this for thousands of years. However, how is it different in Western countries? The situation in the Middle Ages will not be discussed here. Reading modern history, before the French Revolution, scholars believed that its legal thought was in the era of the police state. The absolute sovereignty was in the hands of the king, who instructed the courtiers and regarded them as the criteria. They did not know that the law was the norm of society. All people should have certain rights and personality under the national law. This idea was not only beyond dreams, but even if it was occasionally said, it would be disastrous. The autocratic power of the imperial era was very hot, and it was not surprising. Therefore, Louis XIV had the saying that "I am the state." Not only that, but the ruler and the people were mutually dependent, and they colluded in the middle, playing with the laws. Mencius said, "Even if there is a good law of the well-field system, the tyrant and corrupt officials will certainly despise its boundaries." This is what it means. As a result, the national law was relaxed, and the people suffered. From this, we can see that the so-called national law in ancient times was almost the private property of the imperial family and officials. They did not know that there was a matter of publication. A few scholars, or added research, and regarded it as treason, pointed it as a litigator. Alas. Natural human rights have been deprived. Since the French Revolution, Rousseau and others have exclaimed freedom. The new voice of "I would rather die than be unfree" swept across the world. The world began to awaken from a great dream, knowing that the people are the whole of the country and should enjoy legal rights and maintain individual personality. The true meaning of the constitution as law was realized in the world. It was suddenly realized that the national law should be respected and observed by all. Therefore, since the promulgation of the Napoleonic Code, up to the recent legal trends in various countries, from the opening chapter of the first chapter to the final ending, the consistent focus is on the rights of the people. Whether they are enjoyed, exercised, transferred, changed, or remedied, detailed regulations are made without omission. In short, the modern legal trend is the awakening of individuals. Recently, the neighboring Japan, although still maintaining its imperial system, before the Meiji Restoration, was still in the situation of "I am the state." However, since the Restoration, the Five Article Oath has been promulgated, not by the people voluntarily. This is because they are wary of the eastward spread of Western trends and have to respect civil rights. Afterwards, the constitution was promulgated, and they broke away from the category of the police state and entered the domain of the rule of law. The first article of its Basic Law of the People, the Civil Code, stipulates the enjoyment of private rights and recognizes the legal personality of the people. Up to the last article, No. 1146, it has always recognized and protected the rights of the people under the law. Therefore, the people who have obtained their nationality, regardless of any class, are bound by the law, and their position is actually the word right. England has always had a monarchy, but since the constitutional monarchy, the rights of the people have also been protected, and the upper and lower classes are in harmony.</p>
<p>Recently, the situation has changed, and people's minds are shaking. The legal thoughts of European and American countries have gradually broken away from the domain of individual awakening and entered the scope of social awakening. That is, the position of individual rights is the position of social obligations. This thought has surpassed the era of freedom and civil rights, and they are no longer satisfied with the recognition of individual rights by the state. In other words, individual citizens do not have to argue about what rights they should have. They should devote these rights to the country and society as their mission. In more detail, the state has recognized the rights of each individual. However, individuals cannot be selfish and self-interested, acting freely and pursuing their own desires. They must develop and use them to benefit the country and society as their greatest purpose. Therefore, the rights that are advocated by all are not advocated for individuals, but are a kind of obligation advocated for society. For example, the rich must use their wealth to share with society before claiming their rights. The poor must provide their physical strength to share with society before claiming their rights. In this way, the rich have the obligation to use their wealth, and the poor have the obligation to provide their strength. The original motivation for all these obligations is mostly promoted by society. This is the premise of individual rights today. Therefore, the administration of the country, whether it is 取締行政 or 警察行政, is actually助長行政. Therefore, the state must also hope that the people will contribute to society and help society in order to promote the obligation to society. For example, I, a doctor with special abilities, am recognized and registered by the state. This is giving me rights. However, doctors are members of the social service and bear the obligation to serve society. Because they can fulfill their obligations, they can enjoy corresponding rights. That is, obligations should be the premise of rights. The recent trend of legal thought in civilized countries around the world is almost the same. That is, the law based on rights has shifted to the law based on obligations. The law based on individuals has shifted to the law based on society.</p>
<p>Some say that our country's medical system has only had legal regulations since the establishment of the Health Section, the Health Bureau, the Ministry of Health, and the Health Department in the past twenty years. In fact, the establishment of our medical system began in ancient times. The Zhou Rituals 天官 says, "There are two physicians上士, four physicians下士, two府, two史, and twenty徒. They are in charge of medical orders, gather poisons, and share medical instruments." It also says, "Whenever there is illness or sores in the country, there are those who take care of the sores, and they go to them. Then they send doctors to treat them separately. At the end of the year, they examine their medical affairs and make their food according to it. Those who are perfect in all aspects are the highest. Those who lose one out of ten are决之. Those who lose two out of ten are决之. Those who lose three out of ten are決之. Those who lose four out of ten are the lowest." It also says, "There are eight physicians for diseases in the Central Plains. They are in charge of nourishing the diseases of the people, using five tastes, five grains, and five medicines to nourish their diseases, and using five airs, five sounds, and five colors to眠 their life and death." It also says, "There are eight physicians for sores下士. They are in charge of the tumors, ulcers, 金瘍, 折瘍, to wish medicine to control and kill." Therefore, the medical system is set up with the people's injuries and diseases as the subjective. It also says, "There are two physicians for food中士. They are in charge of harmonizing the king's six foods, six drinks, six dishes, hundred delicacies, hundred medicines, and eight treasures. All gentleman's food is constantly imitated." Although this is only for the royal family, it implicitly shows the people the standard of diet. It is known that the ancient medical system was set up for the people. In the Middle Ages, the monarchy expanded, and there was only the establishment of the Taiyi Yuan, which was only for the needs of the Emperor's family, which was far from the original intention of the country to set up a medical system.</p>
<p>In the past thirty to fifty years, China's medical community has gradually entered a period of awakening. Some advocate the expansion of medical rights, and some advocate the protection of medical rights. There is a chorus of voices that seek to protect the individual rights of physicians. It is requested to enter the era of medical rights by 取締主義. In other words, the physician's duty is now under the legal protection of the state and can be exercised freely. The physician's rights are now under the legal protection of the state and can be maintained without fear of loss.徵前, There is the order for physicians to formally register with the Ministry of Health. Later, there is the order for physicians to flexibly register with the Health Department. It is appropriate that the medical system has entered the right track without doubt. However, our physician's position should follow the trend of the times, break away from the domain of the individual, and be a public servant of the state and society. We should base ourselves on this goal and purpose, sacrifice and contribute to the country and society, and fulfill our natural duties. We should not, as in the old days when medicine, divination, astrology, and physiognomy were regarded as the same, focus on accumulating personal rights and property. Perhaps this will not lose our personality and position and will be in line with the original intention of the modern medical system. Confucius said, "The so-called gentleman does not strive for much knowledge, but must examine what he knows. He does not strive for much speech, but must examine what he says. He does not strive for much action, but must examine what he does. When he knows what he knows, when he speaks what he says, when he does what he does, it is as if the form and body of life cannot be changed. Wealth and honor cannot increase it, and poverty and meanness cannot diminish it." In light of this, our physicians today know where to处矣.</p>
<h3>Overview of Poland's Public Health</h3>
<p>— Zhang Yinming</p>
<p>Health expenditure accounts for 7% of national government expenditure.</p>
<p>There are more than 360 health centers nationwide.</p>
<p>The object of medicine is not limited to treating individual illnesses. It should be expanded to the entire society or the entire nation. In other words, the ultimate goal of medicine is to promote or safeguard public health. All medical skills should be used as techniques for serving the health of the entire people, not purely for profit. The national public health undertaking takes the health of the entire people as its goal and organizes business facilities in a sound manner. Therefore, the quality of a country's public health undertaking is sufficient to determine the degree of health of its people. Among all countries in the world, the United States spends the most on public health, accounting for more than 17% of total administrative expenses. Japan and Germany are second, accounting for 13%. My country only accounts for about one-thousandth, which is far from sufficient. Years ago, the League of Nations sent its health minister, Rajchman, to China to assist in construction projects. He made many contributions to our country's health administration. Mr. Rajchman is Polish and has presided over Polish health administration for many years with very rich experience. Although Poland has only a short history of seventeen years since its restoration, because of the efforts of the entire country, various construction projects have progressed rapidly, and industry and commerce are flourishing. Even health administration has special advantages that can be learned by our country. Polish medicine is as famous as German and Austrian medicine. There are many famous Polish doctors throughout the country, with strengths in both internal and surgical medicine. Poland's national health expenditure accounts for more than 7% of the total administrative expenditure. The organization is extremely strict. Its central health administration is directly under the Ministry of Interior and handles national health facilities, epidemic prevention, and health care work. Each province has a health department, headed by a well-known physician. Each district also has a full-time health administrative officer, all appointed by the Health Department of the Ministry of Interior. The health administrative officer has several health inspectors under him to inspect local health performance, report to the chief, and supervise and manage it. In addition, there are more than 360 health centers nationwide. The directors of the health centers are all public health experts. Their duties are health inspections, food inspections, epidemic prevention, outpatient treatment, home visits, and mother and child visits, etc., which is broader in scope than ordinary public hospitals in our country and has a direct relationship with the health of the entire people. Each health center area has a population of approximately 60,000 to 100,000 people. The annual expenditure of health centers nationwide requires more than 6 million Polish zlotys. The sources are: government accounts for 9%, public donations account for 73%, insurance premiums account for 8%, fees account for 5%, the American Rockefeller Foundation accounts for 2%, and other accounts for 3%. Health centers have direct relationships with the public. In addition to free medical treatment, there are also laboratories, public laundries, public bathhouses, and milk kitchen facilities to provide the public with hygienic convenience at the lowest possible price. In addition, in terms of health education, there are public health schools with various short-term training courses, such as public health training courses, health engineering training courses, health inspector training courses, and public health nurse training courses. All health administrative personnel must receive rigorous public health training. Therefore, Poland's public health undertaking has indeed achieved considerable results, and the health of the entire people has invisibly improved year by year.</p>
<h3>The Development of Pathology (Middle)</h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>Let me give a few ridiculous examples. Van Helmont (1577-1644) was an advocate of the Iatro-chemical school. He said: Each physiological rule is governed by a special spirit; he uses a special yeast factor or gas to complete its function or eliminate its function. The ancestors of these methods all earned a great reputation and were regarded as good doctors and good teachers. Between Galen and the Mayo brothers, the most famous was probably Boerhaave (1668-1738). According to legend, a Chinese official wrote a letter to "the most famous doctor in Europe; this letter was given to Boerhaave. The people who asked him to see a doctor were very crowded. Once, Peter the Great asked him to see a doctor and waited all night because he did not discriminate against patients based on their wealth. He adopted eclectic treatment, largely based on the "affinity" between various drugs. It is said that the effectiveness of his prescription was not as great as the effectiveness of his meeting with the patient. A famous figure contemporary with him was John Brown (1735-788). His "Brunonian System" became a huge controversy in later years. This is: twenty-two years after his death, the students at the University of Gottingen were divided into "Brunonians" and "Non-Brunonians". The two factions argued fiercely, and finally used force against each other. It was only suppressed by cavalry. The so-called Brunonian method is based on the "irritability" of various human tissues: according to whether the disease is "excessive" or "deficient", the method of treatment is to use "stimulation" or "suppression". If you suffer from an "excessive" disease, he will give you a suppressing drug—opium. The premise of his theory is: "Life is not a natural state." Medical historian Hermann Baas criticized: "If the human body did not have the natural ability to correct the mistakes of doctors, then the lives harmed by the Brunonian method would be greater than the total number of people who died in the French Revolution and the Napoleonic Wars."</p>
<p>After the true scientific method of pathology was adopted, these pathological fantasists gradually disappeared. What is the true scientific method of pathology? This is: comparing the observation of symptoms during the survival period with the post-mortem physical examination. This is the method called autopsy. Theophilus Bonetus was the first researcher to engage in autopsy records. Before Bonetus, there were many secret records of autopsies, but none of them were as public and systematic as his records. His book, Sepulchretum, was published in 1679.</p>
<p>Sepulchretum, starting from the top of the body, describes records about headaches. Various types of headaches are described, and then the changes in the internal organs obtained from the autopsy are recorded in detail for each example. He abandoned theoretical observation and focused on clear facts.</p>

<p>Talk</p>
<h3>"Letter to Fudan Students"</h3>
<p>— Zi Nan</p>
<p>The students from major middle schools in Shanghai who went to Beijing to petition returned yesterday. Although the result of this time could not be as satisfactory as initially hoped, although they persevered for five days and nights in the bitter wind and rain, although they had to hold up snow as a drink because they had no water to drink for twelve hours, ... In short, although they went through all kinds of hardships, they still returned halfway, but that spirit of striving for progress and never giving up has deeply moved people all over the world, knowing that the Chinese people are not "lambs." From this earth-shattering and tear-jerking incident, it not only shows how inviolable the power of the group is, but also eliminates the almost insulting slander that "college students are only worthy of enjoying happiness and cannot endure hardship." At least, from this great and heroic act, it gave us a clear indication that today's students are no longer what they used to be, and have long since moved from the enthusiasm of emotional heroism to a collection of rational intellect in the group.</p>
<p>From this heroic act, we don't know how to express our admiration!</p>
<p>And on the same day that we saw the news of the heroic students returning, we also saw Mr. Ma Xiangbo, an old man of ninety-six, on the newspaper's letter to Fudan students.</p>
<p>Although Mr. Ma's letter is to Fudan students, it is no different from telling students across the country after it is made public in the newspaper, and the content of that letter is not specifically for Fudan students; so we can say that it is a letter to students across the country.</p>
<p>"Therefore, your trip to Nanjing, even if it becomes a reality, is meaningless; only the pillars of the country lie in the people. Today's phenomenon of national subjugation, its root cause lies first in the ignorance of the people. If you sincerely look at other civilized countries, do they have such a situation? The reason for this can be deeply considered. For your sake, it is better to guide the people than to appeal to the government. Streets and alleys, teahouses and taverns are all places for you to exert your strength for the country. You must make them understand the strength and responsibility of themselves, take up their weapons and rise up, and work together to drive forward, then what you do to fulfill your heavenly duty is also to supplement the government's educational efforts..."</p>
<p>Mr. Ma's words are correct. To achieve the final victory in the national liberation struggle, it is necessary to unite the people together in a vigorous and nationwide effort, and to unite the people together in a nationwide effort, it is not enough to simply "appeal to the government." If the national salvation movement is only an isolated student movement, then failure is to be expected.</p>
<p>Past experience tells us that when national disasters come, the intellectual youths standing in front of the times are always the first to stand up, but if there are no other groups to serve as a backing, this movement will often fail. We do not deny that the student movement has a driving role in the popular movement, but we do not shy away from the fact that fighting alone will inevitably lead to failure.</p>
<p>Therefore, "it is better to guide the people than to appeal to the government." The government has the government's affairs, and "even if it becomes a reality, it is meaningless." What we urgently need to do now is how to unite the people of the whole country and use the strength of the people of the whole country to urge the government to implement our demands.</p>
<p>Only the power of the group is the greatest power. We have firmly believed in this conclusion in several past experiences; and returning from the petition is precisely the end of "appealing to the government" and the beginning of "guiding the people," "to make them understand the strength and responsibility of themselves, 'take up their weapons and rise up, and work together to drive forward'," and use the strength of the whole people to defend our country.</p>
<h3>Street Scene</h3>
<p>— Luo Zhihua</p>
<p>The room is full of warm sunshine. It is no longer as cold and gloomy as it used to be in the pavilion room; nor is it as depressed as it was during the rainy weather just now.</p>
<p>Listening to the clock in the next room, it struck three o'clock weakly. I am hungry. How distressing is this impoverished life! It has been three or four hours since Lao Jin went to borrow money, and he has not yet returned. My heart is filled with anxiety. I have no choice but to go out of the house and take a look at the streets, to see those exquisite foods displayed in glass, and my heart may be temporarily warm.</p>
<p>Walking down the stairs, I happened to meet the second landlord, who handed me a letter with that annoying contemptuous look.</p>
<p>The letter is from Beiping. I opened it with surprise; I miss Beiping, I miss the friends in Beiping. As happy as seeing Beiping, or a friend in Beiping, I opened the letter, and the second landlord glanced at me sideways and went upstairs.</p>
<p>"Beiping, this ancient thing, was shaken and trembling by our strong voices and heroic actions." The letter began like this, "We were walking in the cold below zero, on Wangfujing Street, which is usually repaired, arm in arm, our steps were neat, and all enemies could not help but be intimidated by our actions; but tragedy happened; our team was broken up by broadswords, wooden sticks, and the spraying of tap water. At this time, our masses angrily attacked them, occupied the faucets, and entered their barracks. We were victorious, in the cold and strong oppression. But, friends, I was injured, my lungs were damaged by the shock of the wooden stick," he finally said, "Now, I have been sent to the hospital by my affectionate classmates. When I close my eyes, the long line and the waving arms are shaking. I faithfully await the extension of this line."</p>
<p>Reading the letter, my heart beat faster and faster. Every word was like a needle stimulating my nerves, and every time I read a word, my entire soul seemed to be attracted. As I read the letter, I slowly walked out of the door. At the entrance of the alley, there were a row of goods piled up, all people. These people, like the words on the letter, attracted me and quickened my pace to go forward. Walking in the crowd.</p>
<p>These people here are exactly the people mentioned in the letter. They are wearing thin clothes and looking everywhere for places to sell food. They are hungry.</p>
<p>The streets are all occupied by them. The deserted streets of the past have now become as lively as a market.</p>
<p>They found every food store, from sesame cakes to bread, and all were eaten up in an instant.</p>
<p>I stood in front of a steamed bun shop, watching them compete to buy enthusiastically. One pot had just come out, and the second pot was not enough to distribute. Young people are always so hungry and thirsty, always so heroic. They are not afraid at all when they are facing the enemy. What's more, they are facing these foods, and they are precisely hungry. I smelled the fragrance of the steamed buns, and my stomach seemed to forget that it was hungry.</p>
<p>My hand tightly held the friend's letter, looking at the young people here. My heart was beating tightly, and my blood was boiling.</p>
<p>These people were holding a white piece of paper in their hands, and the black words printed on it were like written in blood. Every word was like a flame, burning people's eyes. I looked at those tense faces and the heads sticking out from the windows, and I remembered the words in my friend's letter—I closed my eyes, and the long line and the waving arms were shaking. I faithfully await the extension of this line." Now, this line has been extended from Beiping to ××. Faithful friend, you see, it will soon be extended to the whole country.</p>
<p>In a short while, the team was formed. Four people in a row, four people in a row, formed a long line.</p>
<p>A slogan was shouted, from the windows upstairs and from the crowd on the road.</p>
<p>A young man in a yellow uniform jumped onto a platform and shouted, "Welcome the public to participate!"</p>
<p>I followed others in, holding the letter.</p>
<h3>Random Thoughts of Fantasy</h3>
<p>— Hancun</p>
<p>Settling Down</p>
<p>I often have many fantasies, especially on dark winter nights, I wake up in the middle of the night and listen to the wind howling on the corner of the roof, and then I immediately sink into fantasy.</p>
<p>Of course, I am an ordinary person, so even my fantasies are ordinary. I have never thought about the jade towers outside the sky, nor have I thought about the jade palaces in the world. What I think about is just my own little hope.</p>
<p>Naturally, there are many hopes that should not be. I have many hopes that even I myself feel embarrassed about: but I have no reason to hide my truth.</p>
<p>I also know that these cannot be regarded as fantasies, but I clearly treat them as fantasies; what's more, picking out the word fantasy contains my own irony.</p>
<p>I always feel that I am very old, at least, at least, I must be around forty years old. Probably my energy is much worse than others, so the short journey of twenty-odd years of life has already tired this lonely traveler.</p>
<p>It is said that struggle is a characteristic of youth, but I desperately need stability. Yu Dafu is already around forty years old, so he is qualified to start this spring with the fantasy of building two houses in Hangzhou. (Now it is said that the house has been built. Then his fantasy has become a reality.) But I, who am two-thirds of his age, also want to have a house.</p>
<p>The house I idealize is neither in the city nor in the countryside, but in a small town in Jiangnan. The house has a total of five rooms, three in a row in the front and two in a row in the back. The middle one of the three rooms in the front is a guest room, the one on the left is a study, and the one on the right is a bedroom. The two rooms in the back, one is a kitchen and one is a servant's bedroom. The things in the room are very simple and only enough to use.</p>
<p>In front of the three rooms in the front, there is an open space. On the open space, there are four or five extremely large locust trees. Further in front is a bamboo fence, and naturally the gate is opened between the bamboo fences. Ten or so banana trees are planted under the fence, and some roses and the like climb on the fence. In spring, the day is long and the door is quietly closed. Roses are blooming lively on the bamboo fence, but no one cares about them.</p>
<p>In the evening, the setting sun has already set, the sky is lovely blue, the leaves of the old locust tree are green and about to stain people's sleeves, I walk out of the study alone wearing shoes, my footsteps are light so that I don't hear any sound, I look up and look at the sky through the gaps in the locust leaves, and then search for a sentence in the poems I remember to describe the scenery and mood at this time.</p>
<p>The sky is gradually getting dark, the first star to come out</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>is high up, flashing mischievous eyes. I am very familiar with these eyes, because he reminds me of the person with these eyes. This person may be far away at the end of the world, or may have returned to the yellow earth, or may be separated for a few days,—it doesn't matter, in short, not by my side. So a gossamer-like sorrow floats from my heart, but just as you are about to intentionally search for him, he flickers like a gossamer,</p>
<p>In summer, the locust leaves are dark green, and the banana trees are as high as the eaves. Several cicadas are desperately chirping in the locust leaves. Because they chirp non-stop all day long, it is as if there is no sound in my ears. I take a nap under the shade of the locust tree on a bamboo couch. When I wake up, I look at the notes that do not take much effort, and when I fall asleep again, the book is left hanging on the ground. In the evening, I sit on the bamboo couch to cool off. Suddenly, a few friends come, so we talk about absurd stories with each other. After midnight, I open the door and send them back. When I return, the summer heat is completely gone, so I go back to my room to sleep.</p>
<p>It's cool in autumn, and the fatigue of summer has to be recovered at this time. I sleep very early, but when I wake up, it is just midnight. Countless autumn insects are chirping outside the window like a shower of rain, and I can't fall asleep again and again, so I put on my clothes and go out. The moonlight is like a picture, and the dew is on the banana leaves, reflecting a silver light. At this time, the laziness of the spring night is completely gone, and what replaces it is a coolness; this coolness lingers in the soul and penetrates the bones, making me forget everything. Suddenly, a long flute sound came from a distant tall building, desolate and passionate, as if even the bamboo flute was about to crack, so I was moved by this flute sound and aroused a piece of sorrow, almost unable to hold back my tears. The moon seemed even brighter, and one or two light clouds like silk gauze floated by leisurely, stirring the moonlight into a beautiful halo. The insects were probably tired of chirping, and everyone stopped together. Only the weakest one at the base of the wall was chirping like a sigh. I don't know when, the Milky Way has already hung on the short wall. Suddenly, a clear and loud cock crowed.</p>
<p>In winter, it snows all night long. The next day, the sky is clear, and the golden yellow sun shines on the snow in the evening, but it cannot melt the snow. I stand alone at the door, watching familiar neighbors slowly returning home with things they bought. It gets dark, and the fire in the stove in the house is doubly strong. I sit under the lamp and look at the verbose long novel. Suddenly, a graceful figure falls gently by my side. She doesn't say a word quietly. After a long time, she talks about our past from a sentence in the book. She says all the happy and sad things without thinking, because the time is long, and both the happiness and the sadness have lost their stimulation, so what I feel is only a piece of tenderness.</p>
<p>Late at night, a thin halo is added to the kerosene lamp shade, and our conversation turns from the past to the present, naturally common,—satisfaction with the present!</p>
<h3>First Snow (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>"Starve to death, when else will a lazy thing like you starve to death"?</p>
<p>"If you don't starve to death, look at you, only the diligent and thrifty are not worthy of starving to death..."</p>
<p>"It sounds like human words. You took a wife and had children. Don't you plan to support your family"?</p>
<p>"In this kind of situation, taking care of yourself is not enough. What sons and daughters..."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you make up your mind earlier? Why are you showing the world now and harming us"?</p>
<p>"...Sanbao no longer answered, but silently walked into the room to lie down; only the child was still crying by his mother's side..."</p>
<p>At this time, Sanbao's wife's heart was already filled with a cavity of grief and sorrow. She looked at the child and looked at the sky. Although she had tears, she could not cry. Her heart was more painful than being cut by a knife.</p>
<p>The snow was still falling, and from time to time, a few snowflakes would fly in from the broken window gap near the stove, melting on the lid of the pot without heat; a thick layer had accumulated on the ground and the roof.</p>

<p>Opening "New Year"</p>
<p>Amidst the sound of firecrackers, spring returns. The north wind finishes blowing, and the warm wind comes. Three abundance bamboo leaves report in front of the courtyard. Five-colored plum blossoms bloom on the mountain ridge. Temples go in, reverently worship and bow down. The sound of Yuanxiao gongs and drums resonates like thunder. The accountants loudly shout numbers. Drink two or three cups of Tusu wine. Opponents clench their fists for quick fortune. Everywhere, children wear splendid clothes. Every household, women display golden hairpins. Auspicious peach wood charms are newly painted everywhere. The city is full of festive atmosphere, illuminating the doorways. Children set off firecrackers in the streets. Officials congratulating the New Year come and go. New Year, new year, new second day of the new year. New Southern-style ballad singers newly come on stage. New goods have arrived. The New Year begins. Newly undertake great careers in the New Year. New fortunes come to the village, new guests arrive. I, the younger generation, newly congratulate the joys of the New Spring. Please forgive me for not visiting to offer New Year greetings in person. It's not right to calculate the debt of New Year greetings.</p>
<p>Xia Hesheng's Three Smiles</p>
<p>Dunben (800) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "The West Chamber: The Long Pavilion"</p>
<p>Parting and reunion, sorrow and joy, in a cup of wine. A feast is set up at the Long Pavilion to bid farewell to Qiu Kui. Only because the madam is forcing him to take the exam, it's difficult to disobey. He has no choice but to go to the capital city. But seeing the shadow of parting and sorrow in the blue clouds beyond the sky. Yellow flowers cover the ground, stirring up sorrow. Thinking of Liang Hao ascending to the clouds with sweet dew. Sooner or later, it will be difficult to defy destiny. I will steadily climb the immortal osmanthus in the moon palace. I vow not to return without making the gold list. Elder brother! Please take care on the windy and frosty journey. Don't rush on the long horse ride. The horse walks slowly. The carriage closely follows. The setting sun urges with a whip. Don't think about the beautiful spring scenery in the capital. Return to your hometown in glory. Good things are often hard-won, as the saying goes. Don't hang misfortunes on your chest. Rely on river fish and sky geese to convey messages. Specially waiting for news of your success. Unspeakable are ten thousand words of concern. Intolerable is the chaotic dust blowing in the face. Life is bitter with separation. Sending you a thousand miles requires parting. Two hearts will dream together tonight.</p>

<p>Huiling (1380) 9:00 PM to 10:00 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Love"</p>
<p>Society today speaks of love. Modern men and women are even more confused. Love letters are secretly delivered. Sisters and brothers are entangled. What is said. A glance at her beautiful face confuses the mind. Forgetting meals and abandoning sleep, losing track of morning and evening. Please be kind, sister, and favor me. Fulfill my long-cherished wish and make a three-life vow. Daughters fall in love at first sight. Only to say. The man is very amorous and overjoyed. Weak will is tempted. The hearts are connected and a marriage alliance is formed. Walking in the garden together, they are very affectionate. Going in and out of the cinema frequently. Intentionally invited to eat a big meal. Secretly open a hotel, two hearts lean. They are in love like glue and lacquer. Wishing to combine two bodies into one. They don't know the man is really unfaithful. Switching loyalties, they are heartless. Discarded like worn shoes, turning away and leaving. Again, I want to teach others. Women have no one to complain to. Can only cry silently and swallow their voices. Also. Vicious hearts break up young couples. Honey-mouthed and sword-bellied, stirring up evil intentions. Cheating you of your money. Defiling your body. Even more treacherous. The vows of eternal love at the beginning. Completely a false pretense. Therefore. Love is nothing but fake. Once the heat fades, it turns to ice. What love is there, what affection is there. Previous life's enemies meet in this life. Pitiful are the countless masses of people. In short. In the sea of bitterness, there are many wronged ghosts. Money is powerful, and love is light. If money can be used to help. Love is stable and unwavering. Therefore. Money is the root of all evil, and the field of love is dangerous. The sea of love can kill people. Love still turns into a soul.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Lin Chuchu and "Song of the Loving Mother"</h3>
<p>Anyone who pays attention to the news of Lianhua's new film production will definitely pay special attention to "Song of the Loving Mother" because this film is the latest grand gathering of Lianhua's male and female stars in the past three years. Everyone can know from the film title that this is an ethical drama. Of course, the role of this loving mother in the Lianhua actor team belongs to Lin Chuchu. Lin Chuchu has many years of screen experience. Her acting skills are well-honed, and she has received extremely high evaluations in "National Customs," which everyone knows. She is even better in "Tianlun." But we can assert that "Song of the Loving Mother" can be called the highest expression of her art.</p>
<h3>Talking about the Photography and Sound Recording of "Triumphant Song"</h3>
<p>The cinematographer of "Triumphant Song" is Wu Weiyun. In the past, his works such as "Rage of the China Sea" and "Escape" have been admired by everyone, so there is no need to repeat them. However, he usually puts a lot of effort into studying photography techniques and is very clever in using color toning. Therefore, in "Triumphant Song," he not only perfectly captured the characteristics of the great drought, but also made every shot extremely beautiful, round, elegant, and flexible. Moreover, sometimes it is necessary to place the camera frame in the dirty water field. He can personally coordinate the work without any difficulty. After the shot is taken, although his legs are covered in leeches and bloodstains, he can still be calm and composed as if nothing happened. Therefore, it can be said that he is not only an excellent photographer but also an artist who is loyal to his work.</p>
<p>The sound recordist of "Triumphant Song" is Gu Zongyi. He knows that "Triumphant Song" is not only a sound film with dialogue, but also the sound effects are particularly important. Therefore, whether it is the sound of cicadas, the sound of insects, the sound of crows, or even all other subtle sounds, he has conducted a series of explorations and research in advance. Therefore, the results are excellent, fully expressing the characteristics of sound films and the effects of sound.</p>
<h3>"Spring Colors" Volumes 1 and 2 Published</h3>

<h3>Yihua Magazine</h3>
<p>Xu Suling's "Night Bird" has been renamed "A Flower," and the script has been sent to Beijing. The leading actors have also been determined as Yuan Meiyun and Wei Heling.</p>
<p>Only three sets of scenery are left for "The Wedding Night."</p>
<p>Zhou Xuan plays a maid in "The Wedding Night," and her performance is excellent, sweet, and lovely.</p>
<p>The actors for "The Incarnation Girl" have all been arranged, and they are rushing to make costumes.</p>
<p>The "Triumphant Song" sung by the stars in "Triumphant Song" and the "Water Chestnut Picking Song" sung by Yuan Meiyun have been recorded by the Baidai Company, and at the same time, Mr. Tian Han's "Sports Song" specially written for "Heroes of the Times" has also been included on the wax disk by the Baidai Company. Therefore, the singing voice will be flooded in the streets in just a few days.</p>
<p>It is heard that Lin Lingling, a new actor discovered in "The Wedding Night," has a very wonderful performance.</p>
<p>Fang Peilin's script has been sent to Beijing for preliminary review.</p>
<p>"The Wedding Night" will go to Nanjing, Wuxi, and other places in the next few days to take outdoor scenes.</p>
<p>The dam scenery in "Triumphant Song" has been supervised by the set designer Fang Pei every day, with fifty or sixty workers setting it up. At the same time, five large trucks are constantly transporting sand and soil in preparation. It is expected that the scale of the project and the grandeur of the scene will break Yihua's latest record.</p>
<h3>The Ecstasy of "Love Letter"</h3>
<p>Li Pingqian's "Love Letter" has been working intensely every day since it began filming. According to the timeline of the plot, the story begins in a hot early summer. Therefore, although it is early winter, the costumes of the leading characters are early summer new clothes. Wang Zhengxin is wearing a white serge suit, and Ye Qiuxin, Gu Lanjun, and others are also wearing thin gauze cheongsams, holding fans. In the face of the cold north wind, they really have a sense of floating ecstasy!</p>
