<p>— 紀</p>
<p>美國海軍在太平洋上之六週大操演已於本月三日開始。參加操演之各種軍艦百五十餘艘。飛機四百餘架。在海軍司令黎夫斯指揮之下。均已由停泊地向重洋進發。其演　之範圍。北起阿留申羣島。南至密德威島東達加里福尼亞州海岸。適成一三角形。佔海面約五百萬哩。先頭一隊違國際界綫。規模之大。計劃之週軍容之盛。據黎夫斯所言。爲美國海軍有史以來所未有。當此太平洋風雲緊張之時。美國斯舉。誠未容吾人忽視也。</p>
<p>此次美國海軍在太平洋上之大操。事前早於去年倫敦海縮第一次預備會談失敗時透露其消息。迨九月中旬。美海軍部長史璜生氏乃公開宣佈其事。及至去年十二月末。日本公然宣告廢棄華盛頓海軍條約。美海軍總司令黎夫斯始發表其在太平洋空前大操演之計劃。是美國海軍此次大操。與去年海縮預備會談之失敗以及日本之廢棄華盛頓海軍條約。胥有關係也。</p>
<p>美國海軍對日本艦隊之戒懼不自今日。始去年三月。美參衆院有文生大海軍案之通過。同年七月復有無敵海軍計劃之提出。且於巴拿馬運河兩岸美艦隊曾舉行海戰大演習。運用非常之手段。進行其對於巴拿馬運河及美國東部之戒備。本年四月十九日。華盛頓當局又公開發表其太平洋上三種軍事計劃。（一）為北太平洋航空演習之計劃。（二）爲整備巴拿馬運河陸海軍各項設備。並研究運河地帶鐵路職員。限於有美國市民權者充任之問題。因空軍司令部寇爾少校曾有報告。謂亞洲某國。現正用其敎練官。以訓練秘魯軍隊故也。（三）爲將亞細亞艦隊旗艦奧加斯太號編入聯合艦隊。而以輕巡洋艦澳哈馬號代之。此計劃最令人注目。蓋不如此。則設若日美間戰事一日美之亞細亞艦隊將有被犧牲之危險。故以速力極快之輕巡洋艦任旗得策。以上二者。無一而非美國未雨綢繆之舉。美國海軍部長史璜生曾言。「美國海軍此次操演。所以選擇太平洋北部者。係根據海軍部之政策。使艦隊熟悉該處海岸情形」。足見美國海軍此次大操。其目標蓋在由模擬之戰爭。糾正其本身之弱點。以準備應付未來戰爭之危機也。</p>
<p>故太平洋上美國海軍之大演習。不但示人以美國政府有備戰之心。且亦所以示美國對於太平洋問題之態度。羅斯福之復興計劃已走上向海外發展之途徑。所謂「睦鄰政策。」所謂「不干涉主義。」所謂放棄遠東「門戶開放」原則。竊恐皆不過爲其海軍實力準備未充足前之烟慕彈而已。</p>

<p>陝西建設事業及其計劃（下）</p>
<p>（乙）交通建設方面、首堪稱述者、即去歲杪隴海路通車西安、新通車之潼西段、分站未建、路基未固、而營業狀况、卽蒸蒸日上、可　該路前途之發達、必與路綫之延長爲正比、據鐵部對該路西展辦法、擬暫以修至寳鷄爲標準、將組西寳工程局、一面進行西安至威陽問及渭河大橘工程、一面着手測勘咸陽至寳雞之路綫、公路（甲）在經委會西北交通建設系統下之公路、（一）西蘭公路、長七百五十餘公里、在陝省境內、由西安經咸隊醴泉乾縣永壽邪縣至長武、計二百三十十六公里、此段原係省道、於本年元旦日始歸由西蘭公路局管理之、全路跨山越嶺、工程艱鉅、淸時左　　棠曾以兵工修成驛道、前數年華洋義賑會再度修築、勉以通車、今經委會又耗資百數十萬元、方完成所謂標準土路、迭經鉅工修築、代價可謂不少、全路爲便商運起見、前年本可勉以通車西蘭公路局茲復定於五月一日、舉行正式通車典禮、並重規定行車時間及票價以便商運、而利交通、</p>
<p>（二）西漢公路、自西安經咸陽武功岐山寳鷄鳳縣留壩褒城等以達南鄭縣止、凡四百二十公里、由西安至鳳翔一段、係借用省道西隴路之西鳳段、由鳳翔至漢中、經委會現正修築中、</p>
<p>（乙）在建廳交通建設系統下之省道、（三）西潼路、由西安經臨潼渭南華陰至潼關、長一百六十七公里、自　海通車至西安、運費輕廉、致汽車營業逐漸呈减色、尙有「西潼北支路」亦名西朝路、係渡渭水經三原富平蒲城大荔朝邑而達、全長二百六十公里、（四）西隴路、由西安經鳳翔等地至　縣、長三百四十七公里、（鳳翔名產高粱酒。盛銷各地）（五）西長及（六）西漢兩路、已歸由經委會經營、（七）西　路、由西安經藍田商縣商南、以達紫金關、長四百零三公里、惟監田至紫金關、長三百五十五公里、經費無着、僅已踏勘測量、尙未修築、（八）咸榆路、由咸陽經涇陽三原耀縣同官宜君中部洛川　縣甘泉膚施延長延川淸澗綏德米脂、以達榆林、長八百二十九公里、咸陽至三原已通車、今春提倡民族掃墓、更通至距安西約二百公里黃陵所在之縣、全路擬先修三原至石油礦區已令各該縣先修境內土路、等石工橋涵、正在籌修中、以上係主要幹綫、支綫則有由西安至三原、至子午鎭、至南五臺、又由三原至渭南等路、各長數十公里不等、均已通車、尙有一漢白路、由南鄭經城固西鄉石泉漢陰安康洵陽至白河、長五百六十公里、前已草測完竣、若正式修築、約需二百餘萬元、目前尙無其力、惟因軍事關係、已受命趕築便道矣、</p>
<p>此外建廳尙籌辦西京電氣公司、原定官商合辦、資本五十萬元、嗣因商股難集、改爲完全官辦、發電機暫購七百五十啟羅瓦特、營業以電燈電力電熱爲範圍、中央建設委員會以舊機一部、作價入股、現已採定西安北關西火巷外爲廠址、據建廳長雷寳華氏談、擬於本年秋九月前籌備完成、可供三萬電燈之用、關中三十八縣、已架設有環境電話、中有兩縣、且已自辦長途電話、惟長途電話網、應歸交部辦理、故他縣不再擴展矣、</p>
<p>黃河保安造林、近亦提倡甚力、實部計劃在本年度預算下提欵兩萬元、津貼陝西及甘肅綏遠三省、三省並各籌萬八千元、於沿河酌量造林、而陝建廳曾派員調查沿黃堤防、據禹門口北段、可廣植松柏椿槐榆等樹、且沿岸溝岔澗溪之間、現有棗梨桑柳諸菓品樹、雖未成大規模林况、然亦星羅棋佈、株株叢生、可按舊有樹木種類、沿河充分造植、以期編成經濟林况、南段自禹門口至潼關之五里關、長約二百八十餘里、非如北段有山、而乃全係平原、河水東流西汛、寬由里許達數十里不等、北段堤防造林、已若亡羊補牢、原以各縣濱河田舍、殆與河面上下平衡、每屆陽春上遊冰雪融化、或七八月間暴雨發洪、無不立成澤國、哀鴻遍野、故此段造林防災、尤爲刻不容緩也、</p>
<p>關於西京市政之建設、原應由西京市辦理之、惟西京市迄未成立、去歲七月間、西京籌委會、與全國經濟委員會及代表陝西省政府之建設廳、另合組一西京市政建設委員會、以主辦市政之建設、西京籌委會經費月爲三千元（？）、自是按月向財部承領所定西京市經費三萬元、轉交市政建委會、市政建委會則决定各項市政工程、轉送省政府飭屬或逕送建廳執行、所需工程費、亦逕交建廳領發、總觀各該機關工作概况、略爲修築城內碎石路、開闢火車站城門、測量全城水準、擬定市區道路圖表、保存古蹟、修葺陵墓古祠及行道路等等、因此、一古老之長安、果已漸有新氣象矣、惟機關似有駢複、事權未盡集中、此或凡百革新創始時所不易盡免之現象也、</p>

<p>本屆江大排球賽、於四月三十日開始、南京方面、金陵中央、上海方面光華持志復旦暨南、共計六校參加、然金陵中央均因臨時發生事故、自願放棄、故相與抗爭者、衹上海四校耳、轉戰數日、奪得決零權者、為復旦暨南、兩雄於昨日下午三時在持志球場決賽、查復旦乃江大排球盟主、實力至為雄厚、暨南亦傾全力來攻、徐亨雖由杭趕回歸陣、便全隊缺乏聯絡、大有孤掌難鳴之概、結果復旦卒賴丘陳周等之壓殺、以三對零擊退暨南、保持錦標、</p>
<p>第一局</p>
<p>比賽開始、暨南氣燄極盛、徐亨攔網壓殺、連得三分、復旦丘廣燮、周達云、陳宗祺、聯絡進攻、左壓右扣、轉瞬間以十一對五奪得換邊、易地再戰後、復旦蒸蒸日上、一氣呵成六分、暨南僅得一分、比數造成、一七對六、暨南沉着應戰、曾有一度復與氣象、追成十七對十、但復旦方與未艾、丘陳兩將、舉手間、無不立功而返、復旦遂以二十一比十勝第一局、</p>
<p>第二局</p>
<p>復旦益形兇猛、暨南不甘雌伏、復旦始終以二分佔先、自此以後、復旦氣燄萬丈、每有所求、莫不得心應手、十五對六後、暨南徐亨得王南珍之接濟、打成十五對八之比、入後、暨南殊少建樹、復旦丘廣燮之壓球、則有如天崩地烈、暨南無法招架、卒以十一對二十一再敗、</p>
<p>第三局</p>
<p>暨南連失二局後、主將徐亨乃召集諸將士、在網下秘授機宜、果然軍容大振、徐亨一托一壓、以三分遙居上風、復旦丘周陳三將、乃各顯其拿手好戲、臂殺攔網、水到渠成、以十一對九換邊後、暨南猶思出奇勝、徐亨仗其匹夫之勇、扳轉三分、但杯水車薪、終難濟事、卒以十九對二十一敗陣、</p>

<p>— （嚴懋德）</p>
<p>假使一個人做事，能不錯過一分一秒，則他在事業上，一定能占大便宜。拿破崙自己曾說過：他之所以能擊敗奧國的軍隊，就因為奧國的軍人，不懂得「五分鍾」時間的價值。他們每錯過一分鍾，即是多予「不幸」以一分可乘之隙。</p>
<p>訥爾遜有一句話：也能作我們青年人辦事的榜樣。「我一生事業的成功，就每做一事，必提前一刻鍾下手。」</p>
<p>成功的大小，永不會超出你自信力的大小，拿破崙的軍隊決不會爬過陳爾卑斯山。假使拿氏自己以為此事太難的話，同樣；在你一生中。假使你對於自己的能力，存著重大的懷疑不信任，那末也決不能成重大的事業。</p>

<p>— 沙洲</p>
<p>這年頭兒，銀根太緊，對於什麼化錢的事情，都得劃算劃算。好比這一次從上海回家來吧，明知道從上海開出的上行車，一天很有幾班，可是特快太貴，慢車又不經濟時間。我雖沒有什麼急事必須星夜奔回，但是旅客一上了歸程，沒有一個不盼望早一刻到家，劃算了很久，結果決定趁夜晚零點五十分的夜四等，因為夜四等並不比特快慢，而價錢可便宜得多了。在我決定趁夜四等的時候，我還滿以為自己是一個會划算的人，可是誰知一進了月台，走到每一節車的門口，都有人在阻止我的登車，話兒是這樣說：「再多一個人都坐不下了，請你到別一節去看看。」我聽了這話，還不十分相信，把眼睛直向車廂裏望，一望才知道車裏果真擠滿了人，方才恍然大悟，明白到所謂會划算的人，原就不止我一個，而有不知幾多人在。但是不管怎樣擁擠，不登車總不是個辦法，轉了兩轉，衹得向車門口的臨時守衛者說了許多好話，方才允許我上去，上了車一看，我的天啊，車廂裏已經坐滿了人固不必說，就是廁所內外，走道兩旁都坐滿了人，往前呢？退後呢？一無所據了。</p>
<p>「出門本來沒有什麼可以舒服的，馬馬虎虎立幾點鍾吧。」我心裏這樣想著，同時我看見這車上的人也都跟我一樣地，很不整齊，看來都是被市場的不景氣逼了出來，好吧，讓市場的不景氣把我們趕回貧困無依的鄉村吧，我們都是一路的啊！</p>
<h3 id="c197">阿長 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>阿長是從前我們家監督僱用的一個長工，他是江北人，是祖母的北北福祥舅公到長興去開山而帶回來的。阿長沒有姓，本來的名字呌「大鬯子」；我們為了呌起來太難聽，於是就替他改了這樣一個名字。</p>
<p>他在我們家裏足足有五六個年頭，就幫著我們往地裏山上去做工，工資當然是很薄很薄的，——講明三塊錢一個月。這個人本來在我們根本是一個不必需要的角色，有也用得著，沒有亦不妨；所以我們這留用他，還實在純係出於憐憫他無家可歸和漂泊流浪的緣故。</p>
<p>他年紀很輕，長得倒還不十分討厭，氣把子也不錯，不過他卻有些貧懶的性兒。吃飯有些驚人，每次總是四大碗，二升白米還不夠他一天飽，沒有菜餚白飯也會吃的。</p>
<p>我和姊姊不歡喜他，因為他說的一口不折不扣的純粹江北土白，委實難聽極了。我們的小嬸子卻是一位很會打趣而惡作劇的女人，所以伊時常要去捲了舌尖學他樣的：「拉塊，這塊，阿唷噲」！</p>
<p>「阿長，你這人真笨：到了這裏五六年，還連一句江北話也去不掉的」。我的母親有時候對他說話，他「拉塊？這塊」？的弄不清楚的當兒，伊就憤憤地這樣說他，可是他卻「嘻嘻嘻」的裂著嘴笑笑，回答一聲：「這塊的話我學不來」？就算了。</p>
<p>父親死了之後，我們的家境就一天不如一天了：於是在日常開支項下不得不竭力撙節，同時那位多餘的角色，便也在辭退之例。</p>
<p>「太太！我沒有地方去，請求你救救我吧！」當母親算還了他的工資而準備呌他走的時候，他是這樣跪在地下，磕著頭向母親懇求了。母親畢竟動了下慈悲心，所以終於又留了他半年。過了半年，母親便介紹他到附近一位鄉紳家裏去做了一名轎夫。</p>
<p>阿長幾年的積蓄，居然已有了三百多塊錢；在前年，他便要求母親幫他到湖州去娶了一名人家的使女做老婆。今年我返鄉的時候，他的孩子也能夠牙牙學語了。</p>

<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避客辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>志前道：這個我卻不知道。不過根據著大家這樣節省燈油看來，當然燈火是學生自備的。你想想，他們吃飯，連菜蔬也不預備一樣，還肯多用錢買燈油點嗎？他們不買油，學校裏也不買油，結果就是得大家摸黑坐著了。天一黑了，時間就白廢了，那也覺得可惜，所以他們就因時制宜的，老早的睡覺，天一發亮，就起床做事。王北海在旁邊聽到，始終不作聲，現在志前已經說完，他就忍不住插嘴了，因笑道：程先生說到內地學生苦，當然，是在西安學生以上。可是吃飯咬黑饝嗎，喝小米湯，不用菜蔬，這或者不苦。志前一拍腿笑道：呵！我忘了你也是那樣的。不過像你這樣的學生，在西安城裏，總不過是一部分，然而我所說的這個學校，全體學生可都是一樣呢。再說，想徹夜讀書，摸不著燈光，這樣的痛苦，你也總不至於有。所以那天我在那小學參觀以後，發生了無窮的感慨。覺重從事教育的人，自己不到民間去，坐在通都大邑，談些教育理論，想些教育計劃，那有什麼用？好像我說的這小學，那問題就太多了，怎樣子不必讓他抄書讀？怎樣子免了他們天黑就睡，天亮就起來抄書？這就是第一步實施教育的辦法。可是我想教育行政長官，他不會夢想到縣城裏的縣立小學，有這種現象吧？（一九八）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>讀者試想上面我們講的都是何等的瑣碎啊？在頤和園內，就像蜂窩似的簇聚著這麼許多特殊的工業機關，它們又是一般的瑣碎，一般的忙碌。個個藝工都在不斷的努力著，可是伊們和他們的所以要如此努力的原動力，都只是發乎太後偶然的高興：伊老人家只在隨意想到一個念頭，便夠這些藝工們忙碌了！雖然伊們和他們同樣都受著遠勝過尋常的工人所夢想不到的優遇，可是對於工作是半些不能有什麼主張的，所以就稱他們為一羣男女犯人，也未嘗不可。</p>
<p>不過在事實上，無論男女藝工，看起來大半倒是十分舒適樂意的犯人，自願無期的安處在這座監獄中。</p>
<p>他們這樣勞苦的工作了幾年或幾十年之後，難得逢到湊巧，有某一個人的作品，竟給太後愛上了，當著眾人讚美了一句：這個人便會快活得連自己的生辰八字也忘了，而其餘的人，也會因此受到激勵，格外甘心的埋頭力作起來。但是太後豈肯隨便讚美他們的？真不知道要隔多少時候，才有這樣一次希逢的盛事呢！</p>
<p>太后每次和我談到宮內這些工業，總得有一長篇的話兒，不是計劃怎樣增添新的生產品，便是打算怎樣訓練新進的藝工，而且語語精詳，切合實用：因些常使我暗暗地佩服，深信伊老人家如其給人家聘去管理什麼工廠，保管是一個極能幹的領袖。尤其教人詫為天賦奇才的是伊的記憶力：常有許多很小很小的事情，雖然那些親臨其事的藝工已忘懷了，而伊老人家卻依舊還記得很清楚；因此，無論那一項工藝，這總是提調的一職，都非太後自任不可。（三〇八）</p>

<p>珍奇的指環</p>
<p>美國雷羅地開里夫人，最近收到埃及時代珍奇的一個指環，這指環本在埃及王的棺中，用金銀鑄成，有赤綠藍等光彩，箝有黃金製的木乃伊像與愛人的像，外面有蓋，據考古學家的推測，這指環是二千年前的東西，實為無價之寶。</p>
<p>絕食最高紀錄</p>
<p>印度甘地氏為國民　　，曾經絕食了二十一天，但是愛爾蘭的志士台倫士馬克士維尼，係前考克市長，他為支持獨立運動，被英國官廳所捕，監禁在倫敦獄中，然而他不屈不撓，拒絕進食，計前後絕食七十一天，至第七十五日，遂致餓死，其次為印度志士茄丁特拉那德達士，他亦在獄中絕食六十一日而死，第三為埃及志士泰懷夫生，他以絕食五十天而死。</p>
<p>強制老幼喫煙</p>
<p>塞爾維亞東部達紐浦河流域一帶地方，繁生了猛烈性的毒蛇，住民被害者，日有聽聞，其後發覺為毒蛇所咬，可噴煙草的煙，就可解毒，因此塞爾維亞政府頒布喫煙令，不令男女老小，均須喫煙，並令各小學校教師，指導吸煙的方法，因此該地方的人，人人口銜紙煙雪茄，到處煙霧瀰漫，對面亦不見人，尤以婦女們，以吸煙認為最摩登，競尚新奇。</p>

<h3 id="c220">作品中底心理描寫 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>作品中底心理描寫，從其手法上說，大約有三種樣式。其一，是作者在寫出一個人物之前後，由作者加以講義式的說明。其二，是作者在描出一個人物之時，一路叙述其行動，一路反映其心理。其三，便是作者很客觀地刻畫出一個人物，使這人物渾然地站在讀者眼前。作者並未着墨於描寫心理，而人物之心理已顯明地理會於讀者心裏。這三種樣式，要找例子來說明，是並不困難的。但在這短文裏，我們祇能提一提頭，不能把目前作家底文字大篇的引來作證。</p>
<p>大槪第一種手法，新作家作品裏已不很多見。這是一種最偷懶的老舊的手法。啼笑姻緣的作者，在他每天必需寫上五六千字的著作生活中，是專門用這手法，來拉長篇幅的。所以這手法有時反成了一篇文章底累贅。</p>
<p>第二種手法，是最新頴的。在這種描寫裏，全篇祇看到人物的跳動，作者底面目，絕不在篇幅中顯露。張天翼先生對於這個手法，運用得非常熟練而且巧妙。他底蜜蜂和定命論與算命論，是最好的例子。</p>
<p>第三種手法雖然「古已有之」。但運用得恰得好處，要算彷徨吶喊的作者。在彷徨和吶喊二册小說裏的不少典型人物，全是活現的，各有各的特性。作者無意於心理描寫，而實際却深入於心理描寫的境地。在這一手法裏，作者並不黏着於人物之心理的說明，而能有人物與人物之關涉上作一個對比，或作一反映。紅樓夢有一段賈蓉向王熙鳳借玻璃坑屏的描寫，眞是一段很好的心理描寫。直到賈　已經借得了風屏，「這王熙鳳又想起一件事來。便向窓外呌：「蓉兒回來」，外面幾個人接聲說：「　大爺快回來」……垂手侍立，聽何指示。那鳳姐只管慢慢的吃茶，出了半日神方笑道：「罷了，你且去吧。……這可謂把王熙鳳歡喜賈蓉的心理活活描出了。</p>
<p>但這二種心理描寫的手法，是爲各個作家創作的方法所决定的。大抵第一種作者，多半是立足於唯心論哲學基礎上的，想在文學裏，由於個人底心理的解部，，進而理解社會心理的。第二種作者，未嘗不認識作品中人物之社會關係，但每每把人物底社會關係單純化了。結果，人物個性，表現得非常活躍，而掩沒了個性底發育的基礎。無疑地作者是從現實觀點出發，又走到心理路上去了。祇有第三種作者，是有他正確的社會觀的。雖然他那一書中之人物，乃用以示例，而非注重個性。」雖然「彼等之價値，不在與同境遇之其他人物相異，乃在與之相同，卽在其共性，而非在其特性」。但「示例」，亦必須有其「典型性」，「共性」亦必須與另一「共性」，作一個明白的對比；而顯示其特性。祇有這樣作品中人物，是能表現得更現實的。更有生命的。</p>
<h3 id="c221">出於意料的情事 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>因爲蚊子和老鼠吵鬧得厲害，後半夜才睡着，到了天亮還是沒有醒，而且做起夢來了。做夢本是常事，但夢得這樣美妙，感到這樣快慰，實在是少有的。會得突然做到這樣的夢，前些時候同然不曾想着，也是元從想到的，因爲同在夢中一道游嬉的人，是不久以前才認識的。</p>
<p>做夢固然是常事；夢做得好，有時還期望着，並不怎樣奇怪。同樣，夢被驚醒也是常事，好夢當然　也難免被驚醒。可是這次，我這樣突然做了非常難得的夢，正在一道玩得有趣，甜蜜的感受忽然中斷了，是被地動震醒的。</p>
<p>我本住在台灣海峽的一邊，所以入春兩個多月以來，不時的受到狂風大雨的襲擊。這次台灣大地震，餘波所及，眠床和窗門都被震得格格作響，說起來不能算是怎樣奇怪。可是怎麼這樣凑巧呢：我在這僩時候會得漂泊到這裏來住着，認識這樣的人，這樣的在夢中聚會，而且這樣的被驚醒？</p>
<p>眠床和窗鬥接連格格的響了三次，過了二十多分鐘又響了一次；我再也睡不着，於是東思西索，愈想愈覺得莫明其妙。計算起來，在這幾年中，大而國家，小而個人，所遭遇的事情，實在有着　許多多都是出於意料的。</p>
<p>我也記起來了這樣出於意料的事情；前年的春　，我到峨眉山上去遊玩，從金項走往萬佛頂，在千佛頂的一邊，看到了個徘徊在路上的靑年，二十多歲，穿着破小衫，系着短脚袴。　非和尙，也非施主遊客，照他瘦弱的神情，又不象是個「背子」。在這種高山上面碰着這樣的人，已經　得出於意料。可是他，一見着就走攏來問我了：</p>
<p>「先生！我可以在這　做和尙麼？」</p>
<p>這更出於意料，我一時實在不能對付。但事情愈來愈出於意料，等不到我的回答，他的臉皮一緊縮，就鳴鳴的哭起來了；眼淚點點的滴下，接連的掉在他脚前的砂土上。我問爲着什麼，他運話都說不成了。</p>
<p>仔細研究起來，這也不能說是怎樣奇怪。當時蜀中，常常發生用馬刀砍死人在街上的事情，那被砍死的是一逃兵；這　一兵」是一拉」來的，所以往往要逃一。又因爲捐稅的繁重，有些人被迫得只好丟棄產業離開家鄉。這個靑年，雖然不能說一定是亡侖者，被生活的困難迫上峨眉山是可以斷言的。生活不好的人委實很多很多，那末實在元所謂奇怪。不過在我當時，總覺得是出於意料的</p>

<p>— 楊偁</p>
<p>婦兒醫院的候診室裏，充塞着孩子們的叫號。</p>
<p>媽媽們坐在長椅上。大孩子女邊走着。小寳實儘在咕嘰着學說話，有時不知不覺的在媽的懷抱裏撒尿，把媽的只有出門才穿的旗袍弄上上片濕潤的花樣。</p>
<p>一個穿着破衣服的女人走進來了。全身堆雪花，眼皮事疲困地瞪着，一閃閃地翻起紅絲：把一塊乾癟的險逗近抱住的孩子，孩子的頭上長起高低的小瘡，兩條鼻涕沿口角掛下來。拿了個窩窩頭亂咬。</p>
<p>她驚奇的眼光，不住地向這陌生的地方打轉，她　想跟她一魄坐在長椅上而，可是，她又不敢；只有獨個兒挨着牆角，就此向地板上蹲下來。</p>
<p>一個白衣的看護，向她面前走近來，先掩上鼻子，才惡狠狠地說：</p>
<p>一那地方不是給　坐的嗎？哼，這樣蹲着幹嗎呀？」用手指着長椅，「是—先生，呵，小姐。」瞪大無神的限，感激似的。却又苦笑了。</p>
<p>人們已起了一陣哄笑。她一坐上長椅，立刻，鄰近的太太們掩着鼻子走開去，故意吐着口水。</p>
<p>到十一點半鐘，室裏剩下零零落落的幾個人，她才給人發現，跟着，叫進去。一個癆病兒般瘦的醫生，在看過了孩子以後，才慢慢地開口：</p>
<p>「別亂給窩頭孩子吃，天天用藥水洗洗腦袋的瘡，發燒的人，最好喝點牛奶，唔，牛奶……現在拿藥罷。一於是給她一張紙片。</p>
<p>「一天擦三次，兩塊錢。」藥劑師遞出靑紅色的藥水。</p>
<p>她起先呆頭呆腦聽着，最後一句，才給什麼扎一下似的，衝口就問：</p>
<p>「多錢？小姐。」</p>
<p>「兩塊一，那個人用點鼻音。「我沒有這麼多錢，掛號的三毛錢，也凑了幾天。求求你，施點功德罷，還我這三毛錢，我不要藥了」</p>
<p>「那我管不着，得問掛號處」。她低下腦袋，看看手錶剛好十二點，拍的一聲，把售藥的窗關上了。</p>
<p>她出了大門，心中覺得很悶氣，孩子沒　好；白白掉了三毛錢。她後悔不該上這兒的洋醫院，單是那套洋氣她可受不了。</p>
<p>外邊雪仍舊落下來，她一步一步的向白色的街上走過去。心中一橫：還是找一個雜症的大夫罷。這麼想，脚步就變得經快了許多了。</p>

<p>— 熾夏</p>
<p>在有一個時候，我失去了一顆友人的心。在上面，我曾取過溫暖，獲得同情，爲了一伴小事，我　易地失去了牠，當時，我並不感到難過，可是時間的荒凉，帶起往昔的回憶，漸漸地使我覺得可惜，一種莫名的空虛，夾着無限的悲哀，驀然地從我心底裏浮了起來。</p>
<p>已兩年了，我不見這友人一面，這兩年來，我在）’羣中活着，好比在沙漠裏旅行，遠遠的，一顆心離開了我而去了，我好似沒有力量把牠拉回來似的，靈魂是慢慢的變成枯乾了，我拋棄了一切友人，以隔離的方法斷絕友人，一切的友人也拋棄了我，用輕蔑的態度小祝我，我只感到孤寂，友人的心是多麼地可寳貴啊！若把女人在生命的欣慰中當作上粒珍珠的話，那麼眞情的友人可以比如一顆堅定的金剛石，不幸這顆堅定的金剛石竟從我手縫裏溜去了，兩年來，我如失了重心似的，靈魂常在薄霧中浮着。</p>
<p>讀過法郎士之“Lettrede　mon　ami"的，想　能理會得到友情的可貴吧，「在生命的旅途上，友人是你唯一的安慰者」，「女人只能使你的靈魂潤　，而不能使你的靈魂充實，友人在後者的要求中，給予你最大的襄助」，當日，我並不理會到此話的眞意，至今，才體味得個中的奧義，眞正的友情能使你生命向上，困難時，　給予你以不索報酬的濟助，失意時，牠滴出了自己的生命之力鼓勵着你再向前進，在不意盼中，你會得到他從遠地寄來的信件，長長的紙箋上，可以讀到每段都是十分關切的字句，無論是花下，或是燈前，他的影子爲在你周圍閃動，因而起了一種欣慰，覺得四周底種切都很可愛，前途是充滿着很大的希望，縱使在事業失敗時也可以鼓起未死之力來奪回已失底一切。</p>
<p>像這樣一種情感之力從我身邊離去，日子久長了，自然會感到一種難言的空虛，兩人的心愈離愈遠，甚至比陌生的人還來得隔離，我想着要去拉回牠，然而終究沒有力量去做，日子在猶豫中過着，往日的友情終如逝水般流走而不再來了。</p>
<p>如烟一般底往事，織在我此時的心頭，人事變化得太快了，兩年前的今日，夢也料想不到會失去這個友人的一顆心啊！</p>

<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>就像他自己吧，廿三歲上死了父親，那時他弟弟有才年紀還小，做不了多少的事，他一個人辛苦了七八年，還清父親身後的費用，料理有才的一椿親事，雖沒有把舊債了清，可是移東補西地一年年過去，總算新債沒多起來。不過性命的確是越活越難了，要是到鎭上去買點東西，總是一年比一年貴咧。照胡永良他們說起來，又是有錢人在中間作怪，他眞不懂得這些話是怎麼想了來的，這些事跟有錢人有什麼出人呢。那一年鬧　荒的時候，田裏一顆米都不能收起，雖是到倉間　去報了荒，租米可以不還，可是自己的飯米，和明年種田的本錢却少不了的。幸虧陸大爺跟縣裏幾個師爺們商量，做成了這個龍會，每人家都司以去借，只有分　的利息。借的時候，先在本錢中間扣了十分之一，譬如你借一百的，先扣下十塊，等到明年本利歸淸的時候，這扣下的就在息息裏除去。不過大家先得交出押米，你種五畝的，一畝量出一斗，去存在這龍會裏，如果滿十畝的人家，一畝就得量出五斗了。等到田裏稻一熟，無論收數怎樣，這押米先得交出去。向龍會借的錢，等到稻熟也就得還淸，否則下次便不能再借。可是這一村的人，十家中間難得有一家不靠着這個龍會，他們一等稻熱先還掉借的債，　到年底又借來了。要是沒這些大爺們發熬悲行好事，他們一年年就不得過去。</p>
<p>有發重重地嘆一口氣仲起右手摸了摸毛刷帚樣的　子，他不明白比自己只差十來歲的人，怎麼都變得這樣古怪。他弟弟年來做事旣勤懇，又不多說話，村　無論什麼事都沒有份，却不料胡永良鬼鬼祟祟地說了什麼話，便變成那股討厭樣子了。</p>
<p>可是陸大爺那邊怎麼去回話呢？如果說有才的媳婦不能去做奶媽，那麼二百　錢是無論怎麼都不能借到的。要是大着膽去答應了，那有才又是那　蠻勁，看那神色是一定不肯的。</p>
<p>孩子的哭聲又從灶間裏衝着出來，那聲音很粗大，好像也生了點兒氣。這哭聲把有發的思索打斷了，他看看天空，雨已經小了好些，那鉛塊樣的天色，還沉重地往地面壓下來，看去三天五天也不會放晴。於是他又怨着天，要是遲下幾天雨，他們割起了稻，摜下了穀子，那麼到實在沒辦法的時候，把穀子去抵押一點錢，也許有希望的。然而如今只割起一畝多的稻，有什麼用！</p>
<p>同在這個時候，陸大爺鼓起那稀稀的　十根牙鬚，也重重地嘆了一口氣。可是那聲氣决沒像有發的一樣沉重，雖拉得那麼長，還遮不住臉上那股，傲然自得一的神色。</p>
<p>「大爺你莫這樣子愁，我總得替你想法子。」坐在陸大爺斜對面的黃忠樸，露着滿口焦黃的牙齒，堆了一臉的笑，接着陸大爺的嘆聲說。</p>
<p>那陸大爺好像沒有聽見，他只顧望着右手　的烟捲，那象牙烟嘴是新近從城　買來的，有半尺來長，據說是最時髦的貨色。陸大爺雖不贊成新派事，這烟捲他倒很贊成的，比水烟袋强得多，又簡便，又好看。他看着烟捲出神的樣子，只有下分像是嘆息，倒有七分是在贊賞那隻象牙烟嘴呢。</p>
<p>黃忠樸的笑臉收歛了一半，那　焦黃牙齒在外面露了一分多鐘，還不見陸大爺有什麼動靜，他才合上了嘴唇，把舌尖潤了澗那排焦黃的牙，又堆着笑臉說：</p>
<p>「大爺你莫愁，得了個寗馨兒多點周折也不在乎的。換奶媽，你陸府上說聲要奶媽，那個不願來，儘你大爺挑剔好了。「</p>
<p>陸大爺的眼睛這時才離開了象牙烟嘴，用食指輕輕在烟嘴上彈了兩下，指甲跟象牙碰出了極淸脆的聲音，一堆烟灰便飄到了地上。然後用力吸了兩口，一面噴着烟一面說：</p>
<p>「不過我做事情就要越快越好，你不是說有才的老婆奶水挺好的，那一定叫她先來試試。」</p>
<p>「可是……可是那個欵子，」</p>
<p>「那個欵子等他們答應了我肯借的。我要我奶媽不怕沒有人，他們如果不肯，讓他們向別人去借好了」。</p>
<p>「陸大爺把這最後一句活說得格外沉重，他心裏十分明白，有發他們在這個時候要借錢，除了他陸大爺是沒有別個人的。</p>

<p>— 宸</p>
<p>「中學爲體西學爲用」的結果，是替我們的「東方文明」增加不少的威勢。大之如槍砲電椅等，增進不少殺人與刑鞫的技術，小之如無綫電留音音機，則擴大了「揚州調」無錫景　以至「南無阿彌陀佛」的範圍，使其「普及」。其間如「廻避」「肅靜」之後，殿以「紅頭阿三」的騎巡，「四人花轎」之前，狀以有氣無力的軍樂隊，在此「國際都市」的上和其他大城市，都時時展覽出我們會萃古今中外於一堂的奇景。</p>
<p>這種現象的本身，事實上已經光怪陸離，不倫不類，但是上而至於名公巨賈，下而至於市井小民，每當「紅白吉慶」都看作必要的「排塲」，非如此似不足以表示「哀戚」或「喜慶」，其實就是非如此不足以表示「闊氣」。「闊氣」的結果，便鬧出不少的笑話，特別在此「中外觀瞻所繁」的十里洋塲，眞是未免「有傷國體一。故當道從而取締之，在「昭莊重敦風尚」上，實亦不失爲一件快人意的要舉。</p>
<p>我想中國許多幸運者流，如果說他們有民族性時，則一　一毛而利天下不爲也，」如果說他們無民族性時，但對「世家門第」的繁文褥節，則竭盡舖張揚厲的能事，我們在上海所看某某「堂」之「冠婚喪祭」的行幛，其偉大與壯觀，較之出師抗敵的警師禮，常是過之而無不及。此風所屆，則馬巡隊，紅頭阿三，戲屏，喇叭，和尚道士，砲仗，軍樂隊，種種笙簫鼓樂三敎九流的東西都拉來　在一起，於是「廻避肅靜」的木牌，惹得一般市民摩肩接踵，道途梗塞。這種物事，實無異於「上下數千年縱　數萬里」的古物博覽會。</p>
<p>所以如果說音樂隊的在出喪時奏時行小調，喜宴時奏哀樂「不成事體」，那這許多形形色色五花八門的東西換在一起，也不見得能「昭莊重而敦風尚」理！</p>

<p>— 沅芷</p>
<p>一夥五個人，大家爲一種好奇，一種美麗的想像，和悠久的憧憬，所激越着；於是不顧一切，勇敢地踏上了夜的鄉道。</p>
<p>是陰曆初十邊，上弦月斜斜地掛在天的一角。鄉野間瀉着一片銀白，可是遠地方的情景，糊糊茫茫的看不十分眞切。</p>
<p>五個人用着不甚迅速的步子走着，在月光的海洋中，輕飄飄地像在游泳。狹窄的田埂邊，是一望無際的麥田。負重的麥桿，傾斜地側向路旁，穗子和麥葉，時時拂着夜行者的下衣和鞋襪。</p>
<p>然而他們不去顧到這些，只是把注意集中在一個焦點，即是如何使這短期的旅行變得更有趣更有意義一些。大家在起勁地談着，笑着。有的人還在吸着烟捲，灰白的烟霧，裊裊地繞向空中，慢慢地淡薄，消失。</p>
<p>三里路的鄉道，在幾個人的興奮的脚底滑過去了，他們還好似毫不覺得。待到聽得前面茅湖頭村上的狗子狂吠起來的時候，大家才似夢初醒地覺悟已是到湖邊上了。</p>
<p>村莊裏的人還沒睡，有的尚在喫着晚飯。許多人全注意到這五個陌生的靑年，於是很快地把他們圍籠了。可是村民們完全沒有惡意，只是驚奇吧了。等靑年說明了要雇一隻船渡過湖去的時候，幾個船家就搶着兜攬生意。</p>
<p>靑年們决定了雇那個人的船，便隨着他去到湖邊。（其實就在村莊前面五六丈遠的地方）循着次序，他們一個個踏上「跳板」，鑽進船艙裏去。船家也跨上了船，共總是二個人；一個在船頭上撑篙，一個在船尾上搖櫓。一切安排妥當，就十分熟練地，船向着湖中那黑　　的夫椒山駛去。</p>
<p>船是專門過湖用的，所以名呌「過湖船」，他和內河航行的那些船不同，他多兩個翅膀。卽是船兩旁有兩塊板子，拖在水裏。這樣子，就不愁湖波顚狂，也能平安地航行着了。</p>
<p>「夥計，過湖要多少時光」。</p>
<p>「今天順風，浪頭又不大，二支香烟的工夫，包可到夫椒山。」船家沒有時計，他們不知究竟要幾十分鐘才能到達彼岸，不過他們用香烟來試騐過，經騐使他們的回答有十分把握。</p>
<p>靑年們早已知道湖面有十里路闊，可是想不到只要抽兩支烟捲的工夫就能航過；這在他們是一種新的知識。爲了這使各人更高興，覺得此次的旅行更有價値。因此船雖在那裏微微搖擺，湖波不時拍着船弦潑刺澎湃地饗，他們也毫不介意，毫沒有一點膽怯。</p>
<p>月亮拖在船尾，照映着波面，時時給船櫓撥得粉碎。每一絲月光射在隆起的浪紋上，恰像每一條閃光的水蛇的背脊，永遠追逐着船身游泳前去。</p>
<p>夜的湖面，空曠遼闊，茫蒼蒼地不見邊際。航行的船隻，僅只有這麼一艘，因此更顯得寂寥和靜穆。然而靑年們的心是熱的，他們希冀着彼岸的到達；大家的目光，全射在一個　算着途程的靑年的烟頭上。</p>
<p>等第二支烟捲抽到大半時，船家喊夫椒山到了。靑年付了豐厚的船資，一個個跳上岸去。各人的心上，皆充滿了新的興奮和新的情緻。</p>

<p>— 夏蔭</p>
<p>幾天來，迷迷漫漫的霧，眞呌人厭膩極了。在沒有起霧的時候，這一角小樓中，早晨的晴空，麗陽下的原野，柳林的落照，都像一個特寫鏡頭，那麼詩情畫意的展開在東西窗口。雖然自己不是詩人或畫家，不會在這景色裏想出一句美妙的詩，或描成一張畫，但確會從無語的展望裏，感受到快適的陶醉與新麗的滿足。於其說這是逸致閑情，可不如說給生活疲倦了的身心，特別對於舒徐鬆逸的環境，物態來得需要，感受得深切爲妥貼些。因此這幾天的濃霧給與我的觀戚也就特別來得渾濁沉悶，像突然在眼前遮上一張白沙，迷迷濛濛的一片渾濁，辨不出方向，高低，寬窄；連呼吸也起了不自然的感覺，好像與世界隔絕了似的。於是，我不由不討厭霧，甚至詛咒霧，心裏感到無限的厭膩與難受了。</p>
<p>人，總愛有個足供自由，馳騁活動的光明的天地。霧，雖然還不至阻碍我，牽制我在人事上的活動，但它可有一股無形無聲的魔咒，濛迷住我的心，迷濛住我的眼，使我像墜陷在水沫飛噴的渾濁的海裏；就如霧天的飛機，輪船，無論它有如何大的動力，此時都不由它去自由施展運用。雖然霧裏的天空河海可還有着固定的航綫。霧雖然不會把宇宙做成黑暗，可把宇宙撤了一團無底的渾濁與朦朧了。</p>
<p>記得一次在海上，輪行遇了大霧，時正暗夜，漫天的霧，密密濛濛的向海上蓋下，燈塔的光標朦住了，四面是一片無邊無涯的黑暗，潮　的海風挾着十二月的寒冷，吹得人打慄，海浪打着船舷發出激怒的嘆息。遠遠的燈台的警吿笛，穿過霧夜的海面，拖長地，由高而弱，像一隻獸呌，哀厲冷漠的發散在濃濃的夜霧的海面，輪上的笛聲也鳴鳴嗚地的應呌起來了，接着是繁促的鐘聲間歇地敲打起來，一種恐怖的緊張的空氣，幾使人疑慮到船遇了險。這樣在恐怖的警笛與亂鐘聲中度了一夜，直到第二天霧散了輪纔起錨前行。那一次的霧給與我的恐怖的印象實在太深了，每遇一次海行，都會疑慮到霧的忽然蓋下，覺得海上的霧簡直是海行人生命的殘酷的威脅。</p>

<p>— 華木</p>
<p>一提起外婆的家，就會想起長年長月躺在烟榻上的二舅，和那個年紀只有十八歲也吹上大烟的表弟。母親一定很生氣而又傷心地說。</p>
<p>—若不是念在一個年老的外婆，我眞不願再踏張家門一步！那一次回去不是加深一層傷心？</p>
<p>外婆的家雖然不是什麽書香世家那樣。因爲外公半生的克勤克儉，掙下幾十畝田地，和一間規模不小的染坊，在貧瘠的塲林村也算得是個豐衣足用的小富之家了。外公雖出身商場，可有一副人不可及的古風心腸—一個親鄰睦族的長者，因此很得村人的親敬。晚年，樓房一棟，媳孫盈堂，日子倒也過得非常融洩優渥。</p>
<p>只是，這樣的日子到了外公死前兩年，就因爲二舅的浪蕩行爲，吹上大烟，使他非常傷心悲憤而破壞了，外公更因此不由不想起他死去的大兒子，心中的悲鬱傷痛益深，不久就咽了一口長氣，撤手人間，倒了。</p>
<p>有了烟癮後的二舅，懾於外公的威嚴，只好浪蕩在外，有時偷偸走回去，給外公知道了，又給他的手杖打出來。那時的二舅躲在烟館裏日子過得很是狠狽。後來外公病危了，纔得回去；外公死後，家中大權就攬在二舅手裏，一個好好的豐衣足食的家在他的烟槍吮吸下，開始　敗下去。</p>
<p>外婆本來淸閑慣了的，從來又只會拜佛施捨，對於二舅的胡花亂用，奈何不得；痛恨至無可忍耐時，也只有在女兒媳婦面前長吁短歎，怨自己命苦，生前不知作了什麽　，生下這樣個冤家兒子。只有一個大舅母算作了二舅的對頭，無日無夜　　囌囌，罵了勸，勸了罵。不過到了發覺那個表弟也吹上大烟時，這個無事不求講究，體面，闊綽，好勝心强過人的大舅母，一下子就激瘋了。</p>
<p>大舅母一病，外婆也就更苦怕。不過這於二舅可淸凈得多了。家裏雖無日無夜攪得鷄犬不寗，躺在烟榻上的二舅反心閑氣順的在吞雲吐霧過足了癮後，映着眼迷，神遊在木枕箱內的契紙埋裏打腹稿。二舅的烟癮也眞大得嚇人，日帶夜至少要二兩烟膏給他吹；對着一盞豆大的油燈，幽靈一般地躺在那兒，除了吃飯，撒汚，和拿着契紙出去找主顧，平時那雙脚是不會跨出房門一步的。</p>
<p>一年兩年過去，田地完了，染坊換了財主了，到了第三年——外公死後的第三年，大舅母的病雖然漸漸好起來，二舅的烟糧可起了恐慌，外婆也由於鬱憂內傷，害了不治的虛弱病。</p>
<p>不久，擺在二舅烟榻上的烟燈烟具都進了烟館變了抵押品，二舅又恢復了當年給外公逐出來時的狼狽日子。一次，二舅脚下拖着一雙斷了腰的破鞋，低頭沮氣的走上門來，他懇求母親給他兩雙角子，說是頭髮已經三個月沒有剪。但是，母親沒有拿給他。過後我說母親未免大過使氣了，母親眼眶一紅就說：</p>
<p>——我心裏何嘗不傷痛？只是我早就，對他說過到有這樣的日子。外婆我都無能力分點孝心去養奉她，還能顧恤他！若果還有汝爺在，我也倒不……　　母親的話梗住了，一團悽澹的影子在我眼前掠過，我懂得了母親的苦酸的心。</p>

<p>— 吉豢</p>
<p>在大街上的行人堆裏過見了子酋先生的時候，照老例，對方總是用酸相的拱手來開始「今天天氣好啊」之類的談話的；於是我粗粗地對子酋先生打量了一下：依舊是乾枯的肢軀，與彷彿是披在身上的大得籠統的長袍；依舊是聳峭的肩頭；依舊是枯槁的臉容；依舊是彷彿永久因睡眠不足而失了神的眼睛；依舊是那頂泛了色而又破了邊的毡帽；依舊是一付給現實的厲相所威嚇，在生活的尖塔上給摔下來而受了重傷，　鑽着躲避的牛角尖，而企圖用酒精與多量的睡眠來做避難所，而給弄得糊塗了的腦子；依舊是一述串的彷彿因爲辭不勝意而着急，而慌亂，而羞嚇的疊音的語句：「您您……足下近來得意——得意？我我我——兄弟近來是，近來是——有空請到　舍來叙叙，請到寒舍來叙叙，我現在已搬了家，唔，搬了家……」</p>
<p>彷彿又觸着了什麼不快意的事情，在街之大太陽中，子酋先生不等人的回答，又忽忽地拱一拱手，糊裏糊塗的混進行人堆中走了。</p>
<p>「寒舍」這個語音又一次地打進我底感受，這縱然是二個音節簡單的單字，可是在子酋先生底口中讀出來的時候，呌人聽着會感到一種怎樣的沈重與窒息啊。我彷彿看見了負着重厚的甲殼緩緩地在墻脚下面爬行的螺牛；我，彷彿意一味到了頹伏在地上的大山的重量；我彷彿感覺到　上了無限重的担子，它，壓着人去踏着沈重而困苦的步子，一步步地走向不知那兒才是安息的終點的生活之原野去……</p>
<p>子酋先生在三年前已經有看一付枯槁的臉與不淸楚的舌頭了。那時我寄住在一個南方的都會裏，租了一個人家的亭子間做住房；子酋先生便算是住在客堂樓上的鄰居了。人並不算老，可是在怕人的瘦峭的骨架中，却老是有着一付洗刷不　的「破靴黨」的酸而肉麻的氣派。甚至有時和房東太太因房錢吵起嘴來的時候，也打算向十三經裏去找二個「典」來文飾一下；可是據說總是「一時想不起了」的時候多，結果最多哼一句「唯女子與小人爲難養也！」，在他，已經和阿C的「老子給兒子打！」一樣的心滿意足了。</p>
<p>那麽着，每到月底就總有一塲吵，吵過了之後就聽見「寒舍」裏有女人的怨命的哭……</p>
<p>可是終於有一天，當我走下樓梯的時候，和子酋先生打了個招面，便點一點頭，且在他底拱手之下，招呼起來了。</p>
<p>第二次在門口閑望的時候又看見了他，便給他執意地拖到客堂樓上的「寒舍」去了；所謂「寒舍」，除了子酋先生自己之外，是還包括着一個還裏着小脚的妻子與一個已經是七十開外了的老娘，和散亂在屋子裏的凡件舊木器。</p>
<p>於是聽他談家世，談他父親的一世候補而始終未補到的窮知縣，談事世的變遷，談桐城派的偉大，談房東太太的不懂道理，談生活的困難『寒舍』的</p>

<p>担負重……</p>
<p>「要不是爲了寒舍的幾口子，我眞早就想往黃浦裏一跳，跟着大清王恩去了。現在臼子可眞不好過，幾口子可難活呢。」</p>
<p>接着來的就是想商量借幾個錢對付房東太太：「足下是——足下是大概不在乎的，看看寒舍的幾口兒面上，也，也——」</p>
<p>我彷彿在可厭的卑污中看到了一個悲劇；但，一陣死去了的時代的腐氣冲得人發嘔，在一股酸腐與惱怒的氣燄中，我沒給一句回話，便立起身來走開去了。</p>

<p>「夜來香」，只等待胡蝶歸來，拍了剩餘的鏡頭，即可功吿圓滿了。</p>

<p>— 劉旣漂</p>
<p>E（×光錢部）地位須乾燥不潮。並須設病人出入方便之處。其規模小者有。</p>
<p>（１）螢光鏡檢查室——放射錢照相室及治療室合而爲一。２——診斷辦公室。３——洗相室。４——候診室。規模大者有１——一個或多個放射錢照相室。２——一個或多個螢光鏡檢查室。３——診斷及辦公室。４——治療室。５——洗相室。６——候診室。７——更衣室。大致如此。惟須視其經濟及需要而定其室之多寡。</p>
<p>平頂不可低於１０（由地板面至梁底）內部墻面須蓋於鉛（就螢光檢查室及放射錢照相室而言）入此二室之門。亦應以鉛包之。如其上下層均有病室。則此二室之地板及平頂亦須以　蓋之。以備防光。</p>
<p>f.（解剖部）須設於地下層。與電梯接近而出入不使病人望見的地方。</p>
<p>g.（藥材部）藥局局藥材室及試騐室。均應有北方之光綫。</p>
<p>h.（職員宿舍）無論醫院大小。職員居往問題。爲必待解决者。因辦公以後精神疲勞。當有相當休息。故宿舍位置。一則須與醫院接近一則須得享受公餘之樂。故綱球塲及戶外運動的設備。均不可少。醫生之有家族者。需要往宅式之房屋。故設計也當顧及此問題。</p>
<p>看護婦宿舍及學校。看護婦宿舍以獨立爲佳。然亦須以廊與醫院聯絡之。普通房間。以容二人爲準。浴宅與厠所宜另闢一間。但須由臥室可通。並須可供四五人之用。每層備有小廚房及縫紉室，公用之起居室。接待室。體育館。雨浴室等亦應盡量設置近街處應有大門，而入院時不必經過之。看護婦學校可設於宿舍內。但亦可獨立。設計者當就其需要。臨時佈置之。</p>
<p>i.（炊食部）炊食部分須設於出入方便並易於供給物品之地方。另設一門以使不與醫院之業務上發生阻礙。但須接近電梯，內有總廚房。規定飲食的廚房。看護婦，監督員。工人及職員等餐室。炊食管理室。</p>
<p>j.（鍋爐房）鍋爐房有附於醫院內部者。有獨立者。有附於內部者。須靠近物品供給之出入口。如經費充作。能設於獨立之位置至佳。蓋可使各事便捷也</p>
<p>k.（洗衣房）宜設於地下層最好位置在兒童病下。因兒童之精神。不致被洗濯工作所擾亂也。然平頂亦須以防音方法構造之。如取獨立位置時。則以設鍋爐房上層爲佳。</p>
<p>以上所述各項僅述其槪要。然一院有一院之條件及需要。設計者當於臨時視察情形酌定計劃。固非上述各點所能一一解決也。（完）</p>

<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>——關於建築塲裏用——</p>
<p>帮浦—築塲裏對於給積水所漫延的地方。在工作上有時是感到有相當防害的。監工者應隨時命令小工用打水器具抽乾。這打水器具呌帮浦。（Pump）猶之護板椿呌惠林（Waling）同樣是取於譯音的。</p>
<p>節笆——洋松料有凈貨和次貨之別。（卽頭號副號的意思。）凈貨的質地比較考究。它是經過一番選揀的手續的。次貨多破壞的地方。毛病大都出在節笆（Knot）上。對於有節笆的洋松料是不可以做裝修用。然而往往有些人愛貪便宜。出賤價細買了大批次貨備做裝修。於是乎貪小失大的事情出現了。第一。在木匠方面必需要浪費一次選揀的功夫。第二。將節笆的地方斫斷。偈這種一費時傷料」　的不經濟的辦法。是最不值得的一回事。不過這種次貨用於做水泥壳子。倒是絕好的用途呢。</p>
<p>作凳——木匠在上面做工作的長凳。統呌作凳。</p>
<p>泡脚——建築三層樓的市房·其底脚部份。有時可以减輕壓力的地方。是不必用底脚大料的。那末。對於柱子的墩子勢必加大。好像這是一定的原理。無論一伴什麽東西其擺脚越大。則其上身的高度越高。關於這墩子和柱身相連的部份就呌泡脚（Buttess）</p>
<p>帽頭——壓　墻（Purapet）烟囪頂之類的上面另有一塊二三寸厚度的水泥板。這是　頭。（Apitel）</p>
<p>跳口——天溝（Gutter）的面積比較闊。則跳口的距離大。可是這跳口是指的那一部份。那就是外角度的地方。差不多考究的房屋。粉刷匠在做綫脚時。往往因爲扯馬的緣故。感到極大的困難。</p>
<p>塡頭——什麽呌塡頭（Plate）是一種薄片的洋松之類的料作。用以塡起一樣器具的不敷尺寸的標記。</p>
<h3 id="c240">露天游泳池之設計 <a href="#c240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— 小昂</p>
<p>天氣漸漸底炎熱了，上海的仕女們，對于游泳，感覺到特別的狂熱與需要，誠然，游泳是一種最好的運動，可以鍜練你的身體，可以解除熱的煩悶，但是在上海這地方，每每使愛好游泳的人們，感覺游泳池的缺乏，設備的馬虎，不錯，游泳在中國，最近幾年，方才提倡，無怪乎建築家，對于牠的設計，忽略了，但是看現在的趨勢，游泳池的建築，必定一年一年的增加，牠的設計方面，也要一天一天的改良才好，英國皇家建築學會，曾經發表一　論文，申述露天游泳池的設計，極爲詳盡，我把牠介紹一下罷。</p>
<p>（一）地點的選擇</p>
<p>選擇露地游泳池位置最緊要的問題，就是給水問題，有的取自海水，有的取自自來水廠或井水，總之是要來源豐富，質量淸潔，如果是海濱游泳池，那麼越近海濱越好，因爲給水問題，便當多了，看客的座位，不妨大一點，高一點，使那游罷的人們，可以飽覽那海水共長天一色的滋味，如果是內地的露天游泳池，四周必需有綠茵茵的草地，綱球塲，運動塲，這種位置，最好在公園內，上海的虹口公園有一個，其他公園也應有一個才好。</p>
<p>（二）建築物</p>
<p>甲，辨公室內設買票間</p>
<p>乙，換衣室內置有衣箱男女各一</p>
<p>丙，厠所男女各一</p>
<p>丁，沐浴室，在未游泳以前，必需用溫水洗灌全身，以免受寒，又可保持池內淸潔，男女各一</p>
<p>戍，游泳池己，咖啡店等以便游泳者休息</p>
<p>庚，看台以便比賽時用</p>
<p>（三）游泳池設計</p>
<p>最小的游泳池必需長二十五米，闊十米，最大的游泳池，長一百米，闊五十米，三分之一的長度，是很淺的，以便小孩及初學游泳者之用，三分之二的長度，是比較水深一點，最深的地方爲三米到五米。</p>
<p>大部分的游泳池，是用鋼骨水凝土造成的，四周用白色水泥粉刷，因爲這種建築，是不透水的，有許多游泳池，四周用有色水泥和大理石的碎片去粉　，這種建築，是最富麗堂皇無比了。</p>
<p>在游泳池的一邊，每隔十米，應該有一扶梯，以便入池出池。</p>
<p>跳板應放在水最深的一端，大多數是用富有彈性的木料做成的，上面包以粽氈，以免滑脚。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Continued Negotiations Between Chinese and Japanese Personnel Regarding Police Affairs in the War Zone; New Special Police Force to Depart by the 10th <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Li Yunsheng and Others Go to Tongzhou for Streamlining Procedures</p>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 6th, at noon, Takahashi, a military attaché from the embassy, and a Japanese man named Fujino arrived in Tianjin from Beiping. Yin Rugeng was scheduled to arrive at 8 PM. Iga, Takahashi, Okitabo, and Ishii, staff officers of the Japanese army in Tianjin, along with Tanaka, Tao Shangming, and Yin Rugeng, were planning to meet at the Tokiwa Inn in the Japanese Concession on the night of the 6th to continue discussing the matter of dispatching the new special police force eastward. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At 6 PM on the 6th, Yin Rugeng arrived in Tianjin from Beiping to meet with Tao Shangming and Iga to discuss the eastern deployment of the new special police force. Although there are some minor issues that still need to be resolved, there is no obstacle to the deployment, and it is expected to move out by the 10th. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of rotating the guard of the war zone security team, the relevant personnel have previously agreed on six implementation measures in Tianjin. The commissioners of the Luan, Yu, Ji, and Mi districts are now actively handling it. Iga, a special commissioner of the Japanese Kwantung Army, flew to Tianjin yesterday to negotiate with our representatives. Tao Shangming and Zhu Shiqin have both arrived in Tianjin. Takahashi, the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy, rushed to Tianjin from Beiping this morning to meet with Iga. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Rugeng visited Iga this afternoon. It is reported that representatives from both sides will hold a meeting in Tianjin tonight to discuss everything. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the streamlining of Li Yunsheng's troops stationed in Xiazhu and Yanjiao, Li himself went to Tianjin to meet with Yu and request instructions. He returned to Beiping last night and reported everything to Yin Rugeng this morning. Subsequently, he, along with Li Yupeng, the supervisor sent by the Hebei Provincial Government, and Qu Shihe, the secretary of the Ji-Mi District Public Office, discussed the reorganization procedures. The three of them went to Tongzhou this afternoon. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Yunsheng said that the streamlining of his troops has been decided after seeking instructions from Yu. He is going to Tongzhou to meet with Section Chief Li of the Provincial Government and Secretary Qu of the Commissioner's Office to handle the matter. However, the procedures are quite complicated, and it is difficult to predict when it will be completed. Li Yupeng said that they are going to Tongzhou to begin the reorganization of Li Yunsheng's troops, which will be reorganized according to the initially legally determined quota. The required reorganization expenses have already been fully raised, so there are no problems. Those who are eliminated will be transported back to their hometowns in batches. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Japanese and Puppet Troops Increase Garrison in the Dolon Area; Japanese Establish Two Reclamation and Grazing Companies <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army in Dolon recently rotated its garrison with the Japanese army in a certain location. The puppet troops are still led by Li Shouxin, the puppet Chahar East Garrison Commander. The Japanese now believe that there are too few troops stationed in Dolon, so they have specially transferred Chen Jing's regiment, which belongs to Wang Jingxiu's 7th Puppet Rehe Army, to Dolon. Chen's regiment, consisting of Du Zhiqiang and Zhao Shouyuan's two battalions, is stationed in Daliangdi and Yushugou, which are under the jurisdiction of Dolon County. The Japanese have established the Huaxing Reclamation and Grazing Company in Daliangdi, with Ji Xunian as the general manager, and have organized the Xinji Reclamation and Grazing Company in Guyuan, with Zhang Lianzhu as the general manager, to handle reclamation and grazing affairs in various parts of eastern Chahar. They are forcing Mongolians with sheep flocks to pay taxes to these companies, otherwise, they will not be allowed to graze livestock. In addition, the Japanese have recently been found to be surveying land in the villages of Zhanyuan Erdaoqu, causing extreme panic among the residents. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) It is widely rumored in Gubeikou that Sun Wenqin's Rehe Righteous Army, leading more than 1,200 people, occupied Xialicheng on the 4th of this month. The main force has already approached Chengde. The Japanese and puppet troops are extremely panicked and have dispatched Japanese and puppet troops from Gubeikou and other counties near Chengde to provide assistance and ordered Li Shouxin's puppet Chahar East Army to block the Huai River area. After receiving the order, the Japanese army in Gubeikou has completely moved out. Refugees from Chengde are fleeing everywhere, in a state of extreme distress. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) He Yingqin returned to Beiping from Tianjin by special train at 2:40 PM on the 6th. He stopped in Langfang for an hour to inspect the garrison. He is expected to arrive at 7:30 PM. Fu Zhan Kui, Men Zhizhong, and some of his staff returned to Beiping from Langfang by special train at 2:20 PM this afternoon. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) He Yingqin left Tianjin at 2:30 PM on the afternoon of the 6th. Yu Xuezhong, Zhang Ting'e, and representatives from the Tianjin Japanese Army Command welcomed him at the station. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) At noon on the 6th, He Yingqin attended a banquet hosted by Yu Xuezhong at the provincial government. Leaders of various provincial and municipal agencies were present. He gave an impromptu speech, stating that "Currently, due to the calm and dedicated efforts of the entire nation and the direct and indirect assistance from various parties, the initial unification of the country has been completed. Construction in various regions has been able to follow the central government's regulations and gradually implement them in accordance with local conditions. Even in bandit suppression areas, such as Sichuan and Guizhou, the political construction is progressing along with the military power. These situations are unprecedented in decades and are truly a ray of hope for the country. I hope that all comrades and compatriots across the country will continue to unite sincerely, work together, and continue the spirit of past endeavors to jointly seek the prosperity of the country's future. During my inspection, I deeply felt that rural construction is more important than other constructions. China is founded on agriculture, and all foundations are in the countryside. Over the years, disasters such as floods, droughts, wars, and bandits have caused the greatest losses to the countryside. If we do not make timely repairs, the established foundation will inevitably collapse. When I was in Qingdao, I took the time to visit Cangku and Licun and heard various reports from personnel in the rural construction office. The planning of various rural construction projects is thorough and has been put into practice, especially in the areas of transportation and education, which have been handled extremely well. The rural roads are as dense as spider webs and can all accommodate cars. Schoolchildren in uniforms can be seen everywhere. If all parts of the country can work hard in this way, everyone will fulfill their responsibilities, live in peace, and enjoy their work, then the prosperity of the local area can be expected in the near future."

<p>(Tianjin) The Liujiang Coal Mine Company telegraphed the province, stating that 30 Japanese policemen from Shanhaiguan and Qinhuangdao, led by Director Sato, forcibly seized the mine, warehouses, and docks in Qinhuangdao on the morning of the 4th. They also demolished the mine's self-built railway between Liujiang and Qinhuangdao, drove away passengers on the train, and detained the locomotive, causing traffic to be cut off.

<p>(Tianjin) Hu Yuanhui, the Director of the Hebei Construction Department, said that the Liujiang Coal Mine affair has occurred. According to Yuan Tai's report to the province, Liujiang has not violated any mining laws. Ishida Hisatomo, the Japanese manager of the Sino-Japanese joint venture Taiji Coal Mine, stated that the matter could be resolved locally. Therefore, it was decided to order Yuan Tai to rush back to handle the matter so that the situation would not escalate. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Liujiang Coal Mine is a commercial enterprise with Du Yuesheng, the general manager of the Shanghai Merchants Steam Navigation Company, as the major shareholder. The mine produces high-quality coking coal and has a mining area of 4,000 acres. It is adjacent to the Taiji mining area, which is jointly operated by China and Japan. Recently, Liujiang began mining the Heishiwo mine, and Ishida, the Japanese manager of Taiji, claimed that it was encroaching on their mining area. The dispute has not been resolved for a month. Suddenly, the Liujiang mine's docks and warehouses were forcibly blockaded, and the railway tracks were cut off, causing the negotiations to reach a stalemate. The Hebei Construction Department has checked that the disputed Heishiwo mining area between the Liujiang and Taiji mines covers an area of about 1,000 acres. The old maps of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the Republic of China show that this area was not clearly demarcated. The Japanese manager of Taiji claims it as belonging to the mine. However, according to the old map of the Republic of China's third year, the area contracted by Sun Jiwu, a Chinese, on behalf of Taiji clearly indicates that Heishiwo is the boundary between the two mines and is included within the Liujiang mining boundaries. It is planned to order Yuan Tai to negotiate based on this. (Special dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Chiang once telegraphed Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi and Transportation Minister Zhu Jiahua, instructing the Chongqing Customs to jointly form a shoal blasting committee with the Sichuan River Navigation Administration to carry out the blasting of dangerous shoals on the Sichuan River, aiming to complete it within three years. According to the Ministry of Finance, the telegram was sent directly to Minister Kong, and the Hanzhong has not yet seen formal official documents, so how to proceed is not yet known. It is reported that the dangerous shoals on the Sichuan River hinder navigation. In the past, the Sichuan River Shipping Association had repeatedly petitioned the Ministry of Transportation and the Ministry of Finance to carry out the shoal blasting project. The customs collected an additional donation to organize the Sichuan River waterway. Test bombings were carried out last year. The method was to hire workers to enter the water during the shallow water in winter to drill holes, place gunpowder, and ignite it on the shore to blast the bottom rock, with good results. However, it took a lot of time and was costly. After the test bombings, it stopped being implemented. This time, Chairman Chiang telegraphed to proceed, so the two departments will discuss it again and telegraph the customs and the Sichuan River Navigation Administration to jointly handle it. As for how the committee will be organized, how the funds will be raised, and how the blasting plan will be carried out, it will all be discussed in the coming weeks.

<p>(Kunming) Xue Yue arrived in the province from Malong at noon on the 4th, accompanied by Chen Xin, the deputy commander of the Fourth Army, Liao Pinzhuo, the chief of staff, and others. They went to the Doulan Hotel for a short rest and then went to the headquarters to meet with Commander-in-Chief Long to report on the bandit suppression process. They were very happy. In the evening at 7 PM, Long hosted a banquet for Xue Yue at the State Department, with Chief of Staff Liao and members of the provincial government seated. They talked happily until 9 PM. Xue said to reporters that he came here to follow the order to enter Yunnan to suppress the bandits. He will fulfill the mission. The bandits are fleeing in the Yuandao area, still trying to cross the river. Our army has been tracking and pursuing them. They plan to gather troops on the south bank of the Jinsha River. After asking for instructions, he will go to the front to pursue the bandits. He continued that he was very impressed with the counties in Yunnan he passed through. The people of Yunnan are honest, simple, hardworking, and the local gentry are committed to security. When the bandits entered the country, they bravely resisted them. Although the numbers were unequal, they showed the spirit of coexisting and dying with the city and the spirit of "either the bandit or me", as well as the traditional Chinese virtues of propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame, which is in line with the spirit of the New Life Movement. If this spirit can be upheld and carried forward, the revitalization of the nation will depend on it. Xue Yue concluded that the armed comrades in the Third Column in Yunnan have strict military discipline, quick action, obey orders, and are brave in combat. They can be called model soldiers of China. In the future, the various columns of our army will have a unified goal, coordinated spirit, and the elimination of the bandits is inevitable. He hoped that the people of Yunnan would continue to supervise them so that they could complete the mission. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held its 181st Memorial Week on the morning of the 6th. Committee members Ju Zheng, Ding Chao Wu, Hong Lu Dong, Miao Peicheng, Wang Qi, Wang Luyi, and staff members totaling approximately 500 people attended. Ju Zheng presided, and Ding Chao Wu reported, stating that "I have recently felt that the people of our country lack a spirit of discipline, resulting in uncoordinated actions. To discuss only trivial matters, such as the use of domestic products, those who advocate it have been shouting themselves hoarse for years, but those who actually do it are few, resulting in foreign goods still flooding the market and wealth flowing out as before. Taking the New Life Movement as an example, Chairman Chiang has been shouting loudly and ordered it to be promoted nationwide for more than a year, but there are few among the general population who can truly observe it and act accordingly, which shows that the spirit of the people is scattered. Speaking of saving the country, it is difficult to achieve effective results. All countries in the world have become rich and strong because their people strictly abide by discipline and the whole country takes a unified step. Therefore, the most important thing at present is how to make the people disciplined, strictly abide by national laws and regulations, and create a spirit of national unity. All party and government authorities and social leaders should set an example to make the people naturally moved and able to earnestly follow, creating a good atmosphere. Only in this way can we bear the important task of saving the country. Do not neglect these trivial matters." The meeting adjourned at 10 AM. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 6th)</p>

Chief Zhang presided over the ceremony and reported on his impressions of flying to various places recently and gave instructions on the spirit of self-discipline and administration that staff members should possess on a daily basis. He stated that, "In the past month, I have flown to Luoyang, Chongqing, Guizhou, Kaifeng, Xi'an, and other places. Although I only stayed for short periods, I gained many impressions. The impressions I gained were mostly optimistic, but there were also many points that made me pessimistic. The optimistic points were that the general situation in Luoyang, Kaifeng, and Xi'an had improved compared to the last time I went there. The local authorities in Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Henan are doing their best to make progress. The pessimistic points were that the officials in various places still failed to completely get rid of the hypocrisy and pretense. The poverty in Guizhou is something that people can't imagine. Looking back at the highest leader, who is struggling to ensure the survival of the country and the nation, in that extremely difficult environment, we should bury ourselves in hard work and strive to follow and move forward, so as not to fail the highest leader's painstaking efforts and complete our greatest mission. This is what civil servants today should practice, especially the colleagues in this headquarters, under the personal leadership of the highest leader, should work diligently and strive hard to be role models for others. Recently, there have been many rumors, which are a symptom of society, and we should be responsible for correcting them. As for protecting the confidentiality of our work, striving for impartiality in dealing with people and things, strictly guarding against corruption, and striving for greater energy and encouragement, we must pay attention to them at all times."

<p>(London) The 450 million people of the British Empire today joined in celebrating the 25th anniversary of the accession of King George V of England. Since ascending the throne on May 6, 1910, the world has become increasingly complex, and his love and esteem for the people are far beyond what previous British monarchs could achieve. Therefore, today, all over the world, whether in remote villages, as far as small villages in Africa, and the snowy Arctic regions of northern Canada, wherever there are British people, they are raising their glasses to celebrate George. As for the capital, London, the celebration opened this morning with a thanksgiving service at St. Paul's Cathedral. The entire city was adorned with flags and flowers. At dawn, the road from Buckingham Palace to St. Paul's Cathedral was crowded with people, waiting for the King and Queen's carriage to pass by. All shops were closed to enjoy the festivities, so it seemed that all eight million people of London were in the streets. By 9 AM, traffic was completely cut off in the areas where the procession was passing. The Red Coats of the Guard stood in rows on both sides, and countless spectators were present. Behind them were high stands, with the lowest-priced seats costing 25 shillings and sixpence, and the highest costing five pounds and ten shillings. At 10:54 AM, the carriage emerged from Buckingham Palace, and the people cheered loudly. The King and Queen rode together in an open carriage drawn by six horses. The King wore the uniform of a marshal, with shining medals, while the Queen wore a fashionable blue dress and held her hat in her hand. Behind the royal carriage were six more open carriages of the same style, each drawn by four horses, all carrying royal relatives and guests, as well as four Indian princes. The royal carriages were guarded by the Royal Guard.</p>
<p>In total, there were seven major processions today, as reported in yesterday's dispatch from our agency. The royal carriage was the last to depart and arrived at St. Paul's Cathedral at 11:30 AM. People along the way waved flags and cheered, and the King smiled and nodded in response, while the Queen also lightly waved her hand. When they entered St. Paul's Cathedral, all the famous people who participated in the ceremony had already arrived, numbering about 5,000. The service was simple. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr. Lang, specially wrote a prayer, which he read as follows:</p>
<p>"We thank our Lord Almighty Father God, who 25 years ago today, made our Emperor George ascend the throne to govern our country, and has always blessed him. We, for our Emperor George and our Queen Mary, set an example for the people, and the people of the whole country unanimously love them. Therefore, today, Englishmen all over the world are praising our Lord's holy name together."</p>
<p>After the ceremony, the King, Queen, and royal family left first and returned to Buckingham Palace. Tonight, at 8 PM, the King will give a radio broadcast speech to the world in the palace. At 10 PM, he will turn on a switch in the same room to light the great beacon in Hyde Park with electricity, and at the same time, scouts across the British Isles will also light beacons along the coast. Today's celebration will last all night. Tomorrow, London will return to its original state, but on Thursday, the King and Queen will go to Parliament to receive the audience of the two houses and listen to their speeches of loyalty to the monarch, which will be another lively occasion.

<p>(London) This morning, the British Monarch and Queen attended a thanksgiving service to God at St. Paul's Cathedral. The grandeur of the procession was rarely seen in London. In the past, artillery units fired salutes in the park, and the Tower of London also fired cannons in response. The cheers along the way were deafening. As the royal carriage was about to leave Buckingham Palace, the bells of various churches in London rang in unison. At 10:54 AM, the King and Queen emerged from the palace, greeted by thunderous cheers. The King wore the uniform of a Field Marshal and a white-plumed helmet. The Queen sat to his right, radiating dazzling beauty. Both appeared very happy. The King smiled and raised his hand to greet the crowd, and the Queen also bowed her head to the left and right in response to the warm enthusiasm of the people. At 10:02 AM, Prime Minister MacDonald and the prime ministers of the various dominions traveled to the cathedral in seven cars, escorted by mounted police. Spectators along the way also cheered for those in the cars. The Crown Prince and other royal dignitaries also departed one after another, proceeding in a grand procession towards St. Paul's Cathedral. When the British Monarch's carriage arrived at Temple Bar, according to ancient custom, the Lord Mayor of London greeted him. The British Monarch requested the Lord Mayor's permission to enter London and received the Lord Mayor's pearl-encrusted sword. Before the Monarch arrived at the cathedral, trumpets blared loudly, and the Bishop of London respectfully welcomed him into the cathedral. The thanksgiving service was presided over by the Dean of St. Paul's Cathedral, who first addressed the congregation, praising the British Monarch's merits during his 25-year reign.

Yesterday afternoon, the British Monarch sent his herald to lay a wreath at the Cenotaph to commemorate the fallen heroes. The whole world seemed to echo the British Empire's congratulations to the British Monarch. Prominent foreign weekly magazines almost all carried articles commemorating the British Monarch's anniversary. Dozens of American newspapers devoted extensive coverage to praising the British Monarch and carried his portrait, and several published commemorative special editions. The route that the British Monarch will pass through today is decorated with lanterns and festoons, which are extremely beautiful. Since dawn, sightseers have gathered in droves. In the bustling areas, cars snaked along, only able to inch forward through the crowds. Thousands of people gathered outside Buckingham Palace yesterday morning, hoping to catch a glimpse of the King and Queen. When the King and Queen were having breakfast, they heard thunderous cheers outside the palace and paused at the window for a moment. At night, the public repeatedly cheered outside the palace, and the British Monarch repeatedly appeared on the balcony to accept their expressions of loyalty. The palace has been extremely busy in recent days. The grand masters of ceremony and others held the final meeting regarding today's celebration ceremony. At the same time, senior officials and secretaries in the inner court separately copied hundreds of congratulatory telegrams sent from all over the world, including one from Hitler, which, after extending congratulations, expressed gratitude for the efforts of the British Monarch and the British government in establishing peace in Europe. Commemorative medals will be issued within this month. According to the British Monarch's wishes, nurses and other professions related to the celebration will also be awarded commemorative medals. This medal can be worn on the left chest along with other awards. This morning, when the British Monarch and others went to St. Paul's Cathedral for the ceremony, there were a total of seven processions. The British Monarch's procession had seven carriages.

The Koenigsblatt newspaper carried an article that was particularly brilliant, stating that the development of the British monarchy has nothing to do with the usual concept of monarchy. The British Monarch is merely a symbol of unity for the vast British Empire. Without this monarch, although the various dominions have blood ties, they would inevitably be in danger of falling apart and going their separate ways, just like North America 150 years ago. Therefore, the term "British Monarch" is no different in meaning from the country. Only in this way does this term have a closer relationship with a monarch who has the personality and governs by doing nothing. Fortunately, Britain has a George V, so in addition to using the monarch to symbolize the unity of the country, he also gives this symbol a living personality, making him the head of state commonly admired by all parts of the British Empire.

<p>Warsaw The official position here regarding the Franco-Soviet mutual assistance pact is neither to express surprise nor to express satisfaction. However, it is believed that the pact has failed to safeguard peace and clarify the international situation as generally hoped. The news of France's negotiations to lend money to Soviet Russia has increased this ill feeling. Recently Poland has also sought to borrow from France, unfortunately without success. Regarding this matter, the military organ advises France to consider carefully when making investments, because from the standpoint of French investors, building new railways in Soviet Russia is very dangerous. The newspaper and other newspapers agree that the extension of Soviet railways to the western border is a sufficient threat to Poland. The newspaper finally questions whether the Franco-Soviet pact is consistent with the spirit of the Franco-Polish and Soviet-Polish pacts. (National News Agency dispatch, 5th)</p>

<p>Venice Although the situation at the Italian-Austrian-Hungarian conference has made progress due to Hungary's expression of compromise, there are still many difficulties. Hungary is still demanding the restoration of military equipment and the amendment of existing boundaries. This morning, the third meeting began at 10:30 AM and ended at 1:00 PM. An Austrian legal expert recently came here from Vienna and also participated in the meeting. This morning's meeting focused on seeking a way that would be acceptable to Hungary without raising the issue of restoring military equipment and amending boundaries. According to the Franco-Italian Agreement of January 7, although a general non-interference in internal affairs pact for the Danube River region was stipulated, the issue that should be emphasized at present is the problem of guaranteeing Austrian independence. The main objective of the countries concerned is to conclude an agreement that is not too broad in scope, so as to avoid difficulties between Hungary and the Little Entente countries. A communiqué was issued after today's meeting, stating that the goals of the Italian, Austrian, and Hungarian governments are completely the same. (Havas dispatch, 6th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Statistics from recent population changes prove that the movement to reduce infant mortality has made great progress. In 1924, births in France exceeded deaths by 42,840 people, while in 1933, they only exceeded deaths by 21,598 people. The reason for the increase is not due to an increase in births, but due to a decrease in deaths. Last year, the number of deaths in France decreased by about 4,000 compared to the previous year, due to improvements in public health. Recently, French doctors and health authorities have worked closely to inspect milk and stipulate that the milk sold should contain a certain amount of nutrients. In addition, prenatal and postnatal consultation centers for women have been established, so there has been a reduction in deaths. (Havas dispatch, 5th)</p>

<h3 id="e28">The Significance of the US Naval Exercise in the Pacific <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>The six-week major exercise of the US Navy in the Pacific began on the 3rd of this month. More than 150 warships of various types and more than 400 aircraft participated in the exercise. Under the command of Navy Commander Reeves, they have all departed from their anchorages and set out into the open sea. The scope of the exercise extends from the Aleutian Islands in the north to Midway Island in the south, and to the coast of California in the east, forming a triangle that occupies approximately 5 million miles of sea surface. The vanguard team violates international borders. The scale is large, the plan is thorough, and the military is strong. According to Reeves, this is unprecedented in the history of the US Navy. At a time when the situation in the Pacific is tense, this move by the United States cannot be ignored.</p>
<p>The news of this major exercise by the US Navy in the Pacific was revealed before the failure of the first preparatory meeting for the London Naval Conference last year. In mid-September, US Secretary of the Navy Swanson publicly announced the matter. By the end of December last year, Japan openly declared its abandonment of the Washington Naval Treaty. US Navy Commander Reeves then announced his plan for an unprecedented major exercise in the Pacific. The major exercise of the US Navy is related to the failure of last year's preparatory meeting for the Naval Conference and Japan's abandonment of the Washington Naval Treaty.</p>
<p>The US Navy's fear of the Japanese fleet did not begin today. Last March, the US Senate and House of Representatives passed the Vinson Naval Act. In July of the same year, the Invincible Navy plan was proposed. A major naval battle exercise was held by the US fleet on both sides of the Panama Canal, using extraordinary means to prepare for the Panama Canal and the eastern United States. On April 19 of this year, Washington publicly announced three military plans in the Pacific. (1) The plan for the North Pacific aviation exercise. (2) To improve the various facilities of the army and navy in the Panama Canal and to study the issue of restricting railway staff in the canal zone to those with US citizenship, because Air Force Commander Colonel Cole had reported that a certain Asian country is currently using its instructors to train the Peruvian army. (3) To incorporate the flagship of the Asiatic Fleet, the USS Augusta, into the Combined Fleet and replace it with the light cruiser USS Omaha. This plan is the most striking. Otherwise, if war breaks out between Japan and the United States one day, the US Asiatic Fleet will be in danger of being sacrificed. Therefore, it is a wise strategy to use a fast light cruiser as a flagship. None of the above is not a move by the United States to prepare for a rainy day. US Secretary of the Navy Swanson said, "The reason why the US Navy chose the northern Pacific for this exercise is based on the policy of the Navy Department to familiarize the fleet with the coastal conditions there." It can be seen that the goal of the US Navy's major exercise is to correct its own weaknesses through simulated warfare in order to prepare for the crisis of future wars.</p>
<p>Therefore, the major exercise of the US Navy in the Pacific not only shows people that the US government has a heart to prepare for war, but also shows the US attitude towards the Pacific issue. Roosevelt's recovery plan has embarked on the path of overseas development. The so-called "good neighbor policy," the so-called "non-interventionism," and the so-called abandonment of the "open door" principle in the Far East, I am afraid, are nothing more than smoke bombs before its naval strength is sufficiently prepared.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Ramos, the leader of the Philippine rural communist "Sakdalista" party, secretly arrived and went into hiding. On the afternoon of the 6th, at 3:00 PM, he explained his position to a group of reporters at a sake house in Yamashita-cho, Kojimachi-ku. The content of his speech was as follows: "This problem is not that we are creating disturbances against the United States, but that the United States is extremely restricting our freedom, which is the main cause of the riots. According to intelligence, Philippine local authorities are encouraging the Japanese government to extradite me. If Japan sends me back, an innocent man, it will be the moment I become a traitor. The authorities have already threatened to suppress us, who are empty-handed. However, until the Philippines achieves complete independence, our movement will never stop. Only the rural communist faction is actually fighting for the independence of the motherland. The American people are all good, but their government is hateful. I must go to South America for the sake of uniting my comrades, and I will definitely return to serve my compatriots who are waiting for me to return home. As for the rumor that the U.S. government is requesting extradition from Japan, the U.S. Embassy in Japan has definitely not heard of such a measure because I am a political prisoner. I have also not inquired as to how Japanese authorities will handle this. The spread of such rumors while I am staying in Japan is truly unbearable," and so on. (6th J.U. News Agency telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Soviet Union is aiming to build an invincible air force and is continuously implementing its Five-Year Plan. The Soviet Air Force previously built the "Gorky" large aircraft with its own technology, astounding the world's aviation industry. Recently, according to information received from a certain source, the Soviet Red Army is currently rushing to attack and defend with super-heavy bombers. Each wing carries small fighter planes, and its power is great enough to make the air forces of various countries feel chills in their hearts. This large bomber is equipped with two TB and small B and M engines, and the small planes installed on its left and right wings are the maximum-performance !·4 single-seat fighter planes. When the mother plane flies far into enemy territory to carry out bombing, it leaves its mother plane to prevent attacks from enemy fighter planes, allowing the mother plane to completely fulfill its bombing mission. The mother plane has a performance of 200 kilometers per hour, and a flight time of eight hours, while the child plane has a speed of 280 kilometers per hour, and a flight time of two hours. Therefore, within a distance of 500 kilometers, the mother and child three aircraft can return to their base after reaching their destination. However, in the bombing of remote areas, the child plane flew out from the mother plane one day, with no hope of survival. This can prove the fierce fighting will of the Soviet Air Force. (6th J.U.

After this balloon is made, it will be launched for testing this summer.

Now they want to avoid similar tragic failures. (5th Kokumin telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Due to the increasing tension in the international political situation due to Germany's reconstruction of its military, the Japanese Army authorities are also preparing to implement a third military expansion plan. The financial authorities are struggling to compile the 11th year budget because the 11th year budget cannot bear the heavy pressure of national defense expenditures. Finance Minister Takahashi intends to discuss the harmonization of national defense and finance after the establishment of the Cabinet Deliberation Council. The Finance Minister, of course, has no objection to the truly unavoidable national defense expenditures, but has repeatedly expressed his opinion since the 67th Diet, advocating the harmonization of national defense, finance, and industry in order to expand the digestion capacity of public bonds and maintain the credit of currency, and expressing his financial policy. In order to prevent the malpractice of various provinces vying for budgets, the Finance Minister's opinion expressed at the Cabinet Deliberation Council before the defense and political authorities compiled the budget this year is quite noteworthy.

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government will begin negotiations with the Japanese government within days regarding the transfer of North Sakhalin to Japan. Regarding the Soviet government's determination to abandon this territory, the government side stated informally that if the North Sakhalin transfer issue is resolved satisfactorily in the future, it can reduce disputes in the border areas between Japan, the Soviet Union, and Manchuria, and have good results diplomatically. It is said that this move is aimed at reducing disputes. According to reliable sources, the negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union on the sale of North Sakhalin will be initiated in Tokyo in the near future by Foreign Minister Hirota and Ambassador Yurenev. As for the amount of the transfer fee, it is currently unknown. It is questionable whether the Soviet Union will sell it to Japan at a price lower than the amount proposed during the first transaction in 1923. News reports commonly state that these transfer talks will begin at the same time as the diplomatic negotiations between Japan and the Soviet Union on the establishment of a demilitarized zone between Japan, the Soviet Union, and Manchuria, which will be held within days. According to the observation of news sources, the Soviet Union is willing to sell North Sakhalin to Japan because the oil production of the North Sakhalin oil fields is not as abundant as expected. In fact, the expenses invested in developing this oil field have reached a very large amount, and the military maintenance fees for using the local troops are also not small.

Because Ambassador Ota hopes to start negotiations as soon as possible, he requested the Russian side to handle it well.

The People's Committee of Health of the Russian Soviet Republic has established a committee to unify the work of all parties and improve efficiency, so that experts from all parties can exchange views on this. For several years, Moscow, Leningrad, Kharkov, Rostov and other places have established neurological sanatoriums, and are presided over by famous scholars Fedorov, Lorenov and others. The Moscow Central Neurological Disease Treatment Research Institute and the Moscow Medical Research Institute have completed approximately one thousand types of surgery for neurological diseases. Recently, a patient had a tumor growing in the left corner of his brain, weighing 200 grams, and its roots were very deep. After being cut, the process was very good. After more than ten days, the patient requested to be discharged from the hospital. Soviet technology in the treatment of neurological diseases is progressing day by day, so the international scientific community is paying close attention.</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance's implementation of budget and settlement measures regarding the conclusion of revenue and expenditure matters has been agreed with the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics and will be extended to the end of May. Previously, the revenue and expenditure of various agencies before the end of the 22nd year were not handled in accordance with the budget and settlement. In order to seek fundamental remedies, the Ministry of Finance has formulated a conclusion method by the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics, and the National Government has issued an order to various agencies to uniformly conclude by the end of March of this year in accordance with this method. Because various agencies requested a one-month extension, it was extended to the end of April. However, due to procedural relationships, such as delays in review and compilation, it is estimated that all matters can be concluded by the end of May. Regarding the handling of the 22nd year settlement matters, it was originally stipulated that the first-level settlement should be collected before October of the 23rd year, and the second-level settlement should be collected before the end of December of the 23rd year. Also due to various reasons, the first-level settlement failed to arrive as scheduled, causing the second-level settlement to also fail to be completed on time. The Ministry of Finance has repeatedly ordered results to be submitted. As of now, the collected materials have reached more than 85 percent, but Xinjiang and Guangdong provinces have not yet submitted them. It is estimated that it can be completed before the end of June. (6th Special Telegram)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance, based on the detailed report submitted by Shi Jianhan regarding the reorganization of tobacco and alcohol tax revenue in Fujian Province, stated that the province's tobacco and alcohol tax revenue has been too low for years, resulting in national losses of over 200,000 annually. Various branch bureaus and collection bureaus have accumulated malpractices over the years, with private commissions alone totaling at least four to five thousand yuan per month, resulting in direct national losses of five to eight hundred thousand annually. The Ministry of Finance believes that the proposed reorganization measures in the original report are not without merit and has instructed the Director of the Fujian Stamp Tax Bureau to assess the situation, promptly formulate reorganization measures, and actively remedy the situation. The collection of tobacco and alcohol taxes in all subordinate areas must uniformly comply with the regulations and issue various certificates issued by the Ministry, absolutely prohibiting the private production of receipts to prevent the erosion of tax revenue. The Bureau Director should conduct strict inspections at all times, and any subordinate collection staff who dare to disobey the regulations should be severely punished according to the law. The original report's mention of private commissions indicates that this type of malpractice violates laws and regulations. The Bureau Director, now that the reorganization is beginning, must thoroughly eliminate all previous accumulated malpractices. (6th dispatch)</p>

The bank protection project upstream of the Qin River has also been funded with 70,000 yuan by the Yellow River Conservancy Commission. Emergency projects in other parts of Henan are being planned and built by technical personnel. (6th Central News dispatch)</p>

<p>Shaanxi's Construction Projects and Plans (Continued)</p>
<p>(B) In terms of transportation construction, the most noteworthy event is the opening of the Longhai Railway to Xi'an at the end of last year. Although the new Tongxi section has not yet had stations built and the roadbed is not yet consolidated, the business situation is flourishing, indicating that the development of the railway's future will be directly proportional to the extension of the route. According to the Ministry of Railways' plan for the western expansion of the railway, the plan is to temporarily take the repair to Baoji as the standard. The Western Baoji Engineering Bureau will be set up, while proceeding with the Xi'an to Weiyang section and the Wei River Bridge project, and starting surveying the Xianyang to Baoji route. Highways: (A) Highways under the Northwest Transportation Construction System of the Economic Commission, (1) Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, over 750 kilometers long. The section within Shaanxi Province, from Xi'an via Xianyang, Liquan, Qianxian, Yongshou, Zhaoxian to Changwu, is 236 kilometers. This section was originally a provincial road, but was brought under the management of the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway Bureau on the first day of this year. The entire road crosses mountains and ridges, and the project is arduous. In the Qing Dynasty, Zuo Zongtang once used soldiers to build a post road. In recent years, the China International Famine Relief Commission rebuilt it again to allow passage. Now the Economic Commission has spent hundreds of thousands of yuan to complete the so-called standard earthen road. It can be said that the construction has been costly. To facilitate commercial transportation on the entire road, it could have been barely opened to traffic last year. The Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway Bureau has now set the date of May 1 for a formal opening ceremony and has re-stipulated driving times and fares to facilitate commercial transportation and benefit traffic.</p>
<p>(2) Xi'an-Hanzhong Highway, from Xi'an via Xianyang, Wugong, Qishan, Baoji, Fengxian, Liuba, Baocheng, etc., to Nanzheng County, a total of 420 kilometers. The section from Xi'an to Fengxiang borrows the Xifeng section of the provincial road Xi'an-Longhai Road. The section from Fengxiang to Hanzhong is currently being built by the Economic Commission.</p>
<p>(B) Provincial roads under the Transportation Construction System of the Construction Department, (3) Xi'an-Tongguan Road, from Xi'an via Lintong, Weinan, Huayin to Tongguan, 167 kilometers long. Since the opening of the Longhai Railway to Xi'an, the freight costs have been low, causing the automobile business to gradually decline. There is also the "Xi'an-Tongguan North Branch Road," also known as the Xi'an-Chaoyi Road, which crosses the Wei River via Sanyuan, Fuping, Pucheng, Dali, and Chaoyi, with a total length of 260 kilometers. (4) Xi'an-Longxian Road, from Xi'an via Fengxiang and other places to Longxian, is 347 kilometers long. (Fengxiang's specialty sorghum wine is sold extensively in various places.) (5) Xi'an-Changwu and (6) Xi'an-Hanzhong roads have been taken over by the Economic Commission. (7) Xi'an-(missing character) Road, from Xi'an via Lantian, Shangxian, Shangnan, to Zijing Pass, is 403 kilometers long. However, the section from Lantian to Zijing Pass, which is 355 kilometers long, has no funding and has only been surveyed and has not yet been built. (8) Xianyang-Yulin Road, from Xianyang via Jingyang, Sanyuan, Yaoxian, Tongguan, Yijun, Central, Luochuan, (missing character)xian, Ganquan, Fushi, Yanchang, Yanchuan, Qingjian, Suide, Mizhi, to Yulin, is 829 kilometers long. The Xianyang to Sanyuan section is open to traffic. This spring, in promoting ethnic tomb-sweeping, it was further extended to the county where the Huangling Mausoleum is located, about 200 kilometers from Anxi. The entire road is planned to first repair the Sanyuan to Oil Field section, and each county has been ordered to first repair the earthen roads within their boundaries. Stone works, bridges, and culverts are currently being planned for repair. The above are the main trunk lines. The branch lines include roads from Xi'an to Sanyuan, to Ziwu Town, and to South Wutai, as well as from Sanyuan to Weinan, each several tens of kilometers long and already open to traffic. There is also a Han-Bai Road, from Nanzheng via Chenggu, Xixiang, Shiquan, Hanyin, Ankang, Xunyang to Baihe, 560 kilometers long. It has been roughly surveyed and completed, and if formally built, it will cost more than 2 million yuan. Currently, there is no capacity to do so. However, due to military relations, orders have been received to rush the construction of a temporary road.</p>
<p>In addition, the Construction Department is also preparing to establish the Xijing Electric Company. It was originally planned as a joint venture between the government and merchants, with a capital of 500,000 yuan. However, because it was difficult to raise merchant shares, it was changed to a completely government-run enterprise. The generator will temporarily purchase 750 kilowatts. The business scope is limited to electric lights, electricity, and electric heat. The Central Construction Committee has invested an old machine as a share, valued at a certain price. The factory site has now been selected outside the Xihuo Lane in the North Gate of Xi'an. According to Construction Director Lei Baohua, the preparations are planned to be completed before September of this year, capable of providing 30,000 electric lights. 38 counties in Guanzhong have already installed ring-type telephones, and two of them have even self-managed long-distance telephones. However, the long-distance telephone network should be handled by the Ministry of Communications, so other counties will no longer expand.</p>
<p>Yellow River security afforestation has also been strongly promoted recently. The Ministry of Industry plans to allocate 20,000 yuan from this year's budget to subsidize the three provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Suiyuan. The three provinces will each raise 18,000 yuan to plant trees along the river as appropriate. The Shaanxi Construction Department has sent personnel to investigate the Yellow River embankment. According to the section north of Yumenkou, pine, cypress, Chinese toon, elm, and locust trees can be widely planted. Moreover, there are currently jujube, pear, mulberry, willow, and other fruit trees between the ditches and streams along the coast. Although they have not formed large-scale forests, they are scattered, growing in clumps. The types of trees that already exist can be used to fully plant along the river, so as to form an economic forest. The southern section, from Yumenkou to Wuliguan in Tongguan, is about 280 li long, not mountainous like the northern section, but entirely plains. The river water flows east and west, varying in width from one li to tens of li. Embankment afforestation in the northern section is like locking the stable door after the horse has bolted, as the riverside houses and fields in each county are almost level with the river surface. Every year in early spring, when the ice and snow melt upstream, or during heavy rains in July and August, the area immediately becomes a swamp, and lamentation echoes everywhere. Therefore, disaster prevention by afforestation in this section is particularly urgent.</p>
<p>Regarding the construction of the Xijing municipal government, it should have been handled by the Xijing City. However, Xijing City has not yet been established. In July of last year, the Xijing Preparatory Committee, the National Economic Commission, and the Construction Department, representing the Shaanxi Provincial Government, jointly formed a Xijing Municipal Construction Committee to take charge of municipal construction. The Xijing Preparatory Committee's expenses are 3,000 yuan per month (?). Since then, it has received 30,000 yuan in Xijing City expenses from the Ministry of Finance each month, which it transferred to the Municipal Construction Committee. The Municipal Construction Committee then decided on various municipal projects, which it forwarded to the Provincial Government for orders or directly to the Construction Department for execution. The required project funds were also directly delivered to the Construction Department for receipt. Overall, the work of the various agencies can be briefly described as repairing crushed stone roads within the city, opening railway station gates, measuring the city's water level, formulating urban road maps and charts, preserving historical sites, repairing mausoleums, ancient ancestral halls, and sidewalks, etc. As a result, the ancient Chang'an has gradually taken on a new look. However, it seems that the agencies are somewhat redundant and the authority is not fully centralized. This is perhaps an inevitable phenomenon during any reform and creation.</p>

<p>Meetings held simultaneously throughout Shandong Province</p>
<p>Jinan Correspondent: The May Third Tragedy occurred seven years ago. The people of Shandong, remembering that the blood of their compatriots had not yet dried and that the scars of the artillery fire had not yet healed, and reflecting on the pain, were overwhelmed with grief and indignation. They held a meeting in the Provincial Party Headquarters' auditorium at 9:00 AM this morning to express their continued remembrance. The entire province lowered flags to half-mast, suspended entertainment, and all schools took a day off. At the same time, people from all over held memorial meetings at the local Party headquarters to commemorate the seventh anniversary of the May Third Tragedy. Regarding the situation of the meeting in Jinan City, at 9:00 AM this morning, more than 1,000 representatives from all walks of life held a representative memorial meeting in the Provincial Party Headquarters' auditorium, presided over by Li Wenzhai. After opening the meeting, Li Wenzhai reported on the purpose of the meeting, stating that the Jinan Tragedy occurred in 1928, and the people of the whole country were in grief and anger. It was truly a great humiliation to our country. Although seven years have passed, the national situation is still critical. All Chinese people should strive to become strong and share the responsibility of saving the country. Today, everyone is here to commemorate May Third. We must recognize the current situation of the country and strive to wash away this shame, so as not to betray the meaning of the memorial meeting, he said. This was followed by speeches by Qin Qirong, a member of the Provincial Executive Committee, and others, which were all extremely tragic. The meeting adjourned at around 11:00 AM. (3rd)</p>

<p>—Providing Loans to Farmers to Resume Cultivation—</p>
<p>A dispatch from Fuchang: The Jiangxi Provincial Rural Cooperation Committee was previously ordered to handle rural relief in the bandit areas of southern Jiangxi. An appropriation of 700,000 yuan was made from the Post-War Rehabilitation Fund. The plan was to loan 100,000 yuan to disaster-stricken farmers in each of the six counties of Ningdu, Xingguo, Yudu, Hui’chang, Ruizhi, and Shicheng. The remaining 100,000 yuan was to be used for land management. Zou Huagai was appointed as the director of the Rural Relief and Land Management Office for the six counties, with an office established in Ningdu and branches in each county to actively carry out the work. According to a letter from Ningdu, the reclaimed areas here are desolate and miserable beyond description. However, the local products are abundant, the people are strong and brave, deeply resent the bandits, and eagerly hope for governance. It is expected that the old appearance can be restored in a few years. The offices in the six counties are proceeding according to the newly promulgated Rural Relief and Land Management Plan of the Headquarters. Regarding the abolition of land boundaries by the Red bandits, due to the utter chaos, they will be reorganized to determine ownership, rectify boundaries, and eliminate disputes, so that everyone has land to cultivate, and every field has someone to cultivate it. At the same time, disaster-stricken farmers who are unable to resume cultivation will first be organized into cooperative societies, and then provided with loans to purchase plowing cattle, seeds, farm tools, and food to resume cultivation and engage in production. Currently, one-third of each of these tasks has been completed. As of April 20th, there are 400 cooperative societies in the six counties, with more than 4,400,000 farmers participating. Loans of more than 100,000 yuan have been issued, and progress is continuing. (May 4th)</p>
<h3 id="e88">Headquarters Convenes Military Industry and Construction Conference <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>Experts from National Construction Agencies Attend / Proposals Reviewed by Four Groups / Conference Scheduled for Three Days</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou: Chairman Chiang, in order to promote the National Economic Construction Movement, has been actively advocating military industry and construction. Recently, he telegraphed the Headquarters to convene responsible personnel and experts from national construction agencies to hold a Military Industry and Construction Conference to study and implement the plan. The conference opened at 10:00 a.m. on the 3rd at the Headquarters. More than 70 representatives from provincial construction agencies and directors of various departments of the Headquarters, totaling more than 70 people, attended. Zhang Xueliang, Director of the Headquarters, had not yet returned to Hubei and was represented by Chief of Staff Qian Dajun as chairman. He also delivered a speech on behalf of Chairman Chiang, which stated: "Today, the Military Industry and Construction Conference opens. Chairman Chiang is in Guizhou supervising the remnants of bandits, and Director Zhang has also flown out on official business and are unable to attend. I will say a few words on behalf of the Chairman. Currently, the most important and urgent problems facing our country are nothing more than bandit suppression, national defense, and construction. In terms of importance, bandit suppression is of course the first priority, followed by national defense, and then construction. However, under the current international situation and the urgent needs of the national economy and the people's livelihood, it is necessary to plan for all three and advance them simultaneously. Therefore, during the period of implementing military bandit suppression, we must, of course, aim at bandit suppression while also taking into account the two conditions of national defense and construction. Conversely, when we carry out construction work, we should also strive to take into account the two conditions of national defense and bandit suppression. The significance of this Military Industry and Construction Conference lies in this, and the significance of our future implementation of military industry will also lie in this. In his speech at the welcoming meeting for the Yunnan and Guangxi armies in 1922, the Premier spoke of peaceful unification and transforming soldiers into workers. When we recall the Premier's raising of this issue at that time, it had a very profound and significant meaning. Because the army is only prepared but not used in peacetime, it can be said that it can only consume and cannot engage in production. In wartime, it is nothing more than fighting for cities and seizing land, it can be said that it is only destructive and cannot engage in construction. How can we transform these armies, which only consume and only destroy, into producers and builders that benefit the country and the people? I think that any country will feel the importance of this issue when disposing of surplus troops after the war. This Military Industry and Construction Conference should research and discuss this important point. Military industry and construction can be divided into two aspects. From the perspective of the military, it is how to transform all the troops into good soldiers, then transform the good soldiers into good citizens, and then transform the good citizens into good workers. From the perspective of construction, it is how to train and use these soldiers to do construction work, how to maximize the effectiveness of military workers, and how to engage in productive enterprises. At the same time, how can we ensure that the armed comrades who have survived hundreds of battles can find a career and security? These are all the main issues that need to be urgently studied and resolved at this Military Industry and Construction Conference. In other words, the Military Industry and Construction Conference can also be said to be proceeding with this meaning in mind. As for the standards for carrying out military industry and construction, first, it must be a work that requires more manpower and a longer time; second, it is a work that is easy for soldiers to do under the guidance of technical personnel and does not require a long period of training; and third, it is a work that can concentrate the troops in one place for easy command and management. Speaking of the methods of implementation, we are prepared to select one of the projects that have been planned and financed by the various construction agencies, which are prepared to solicit bids from merchants, and take them to be tried out by military industry. Once we have achieved results, we will actively promote them. Today, many of the comrades attending the meeting are construction experts and responsible personnel from national construction agencies. In terms of theory and experience, they naturally have a lot to contribute. I hope that they will give full play to their opinions on the military industry and construction plan, and study and discuss it in detail, so as to seek a bright future for the country, the nation, and the army from the three conditions of bandit suppression, national defense, and construction." On the morning of the 4th, the first general meeting was held at the Headquarters, still chaired by Qian Dajun. He reported on the 24 proposals from various parties and divided them into four groups for review: agriculture and forestry, general affairs, road administration, and water and soil conservation. Zhao Lianfang and others were designated as review committee members for the first group, Cai Guangxun and others for the second group, Liu Shoupeng and others for the third group, and Zhang Hanying and others for the fourth group. After the adjournment, the groups convened review meetings separately, preparing to submit them for discussion at the second general meeting on the 9th. The conference is scheduled for three days and will close immediately. (4th)</p>
<h3 id="e89">Zhejiang Province Promotes Cotton Industry Plan <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>—To be Carried Out in Three Years—</p>
<p>A dispatch from Quzhou: Most of the cotton produced in Zhejiang Province is of a coarse grade, which is not suitable for modern needs. Therefore, the Department of Construction has been making efforts to promote fine-grade cotton in recent years, and has made considerable progress. However, the planting area is too small and production is insufficient. Last year, the area of improved cotton fields promoted was only 20,000 mu, producing only 4,000 dan of cotton, which is not enough to meet the demand of domestic yarn factories. In order to develop cotton production and promote the improvement of coarse-grade cotton, the Department of Construction has decided to promote the improvement of 150,000 mu of cotton fields starting this year. 80,000 mu of Million Dollar cotton will be promoted in the cotton areas along the river in Hangzhou, Xiaoshan, Yuyao, Shaoxing, and Shangyu counties, and 70,000 mu of American cotton will be promoted in the coastal cotton areas of Zhenhai, Cixi, Yuyao, and Haiyan. This is because American cotton is suitable for the coast, and the soil properties for planting Million Dollar cotton are suitable for the riverbank. These cotton varieties have also been tested in Zhejiang Province for six or seven years, and the soil quality and climate are very suitable. Moreover, the quality is good enough to spin fine yarn of 20 counts or more, which can compete with fine-grade cotton from foreign countries. The yield is higher than that of local varieties, and the value is 20% higher. The Agricultural Management Committee estimates that the yield of improved cotton is 80 catties of cotton seeds per mu, which is calculated to be 24 catties of lint cotton per mu, about one dan of lint cotton per four mu. 150,000 mu can produce 30,000 dan of cotton, and the income can be increased to 1.5 million yuan. As for the promotion methods, a three-year plan will be implemented. In the first year, 150,000 mu of improved cotton fields will be promoted, producing 30,000 dan of cotton, and the income will be 1.5 million yuan. In the second year, 500,000 mu of improved cotton fields will be promoted, producing 120,000 dan of cotton, and the income can be increased to 6 million yuan. In the third year, 1 million mu of improved cotton fields will be promoted, producing 500,000 dan of cotton, and the income can be increased to 25 million yuan. Half of the promoted cotton fields will be improved from local cotton fields, and half will be reclaimed from wasteland. A certain amount of local cotton fields will still be retained to meet the needs for planting coarse-grade cotton. (4th)</p>

<p>Li Zehuan (from Hunan), the chief of the First Branch of the Songjiang County Public Security Bureau (stationed in Tinglin Town), released morphine offenders Sun X, Chen X, and Zhang X, along with six small packets of morphine, after the Hougang police station apprehended them. After the case was transferred to the bureau, Dai X provided bail and they were released, causing a public outcry and allegations of bribery. After the Third District Party Department discovered this, Li immediately fled to Suzhou with his family and was apprehended by Fei Gongxia of the Water Patrol Team and sent to the court's prosecutor's office for investigation. On the morning of the sixth, Judge Zhang Yihuang summoned Hougang patrolman Xiao Huanjun, First Branch guard Xu Faren, clerk Tao Huimin, and Hua Yutong, Chen Quqing, and others to court to examine the case. Prosecutor Liu presented his arguments in court. Patrolman Xiao testified about the circumstances of the arrest. Guard Xu testified that the chief made the decision to release them and that he did not know the details of the bribery. Clerk Tao testified that the bail bond was written by him at the chief's order, that the guarantor was surnamed Dai, that he did not remember the name, and that he did not know anything else. Hua Yutong and Chen Quqing both testified that they were not involved in the case and that the rumors of a three- or four-hundred-yuan bribe were just street talk and not credible. Chief Li was brought to court and claimed that Hua and Chen had come to him and that the bail bond was written with the surname Dai. He said that the case file had been lost, so he did not remember the name. He also claimed that the Sun and Shen were opium smokers, not morphine users, that the small packets contained coffee sugar instead of morphine, and that he did not receive any bribes. The judge announced the conclusion of the debate and that the verdict would be announced on the tenth. Li and Tao were returned to custody, and the others were dismissed.</p>

<p>Zhang Jingtang, a villager from Huajiaqiao near Wangting Township in the Houzhai area of the Eighth District, originally from Jiangyin, usually rows a boat in the Hengfeng Sauce Garden in Shanghai. He recently happened to be at home. At one o'clock the night before, the family had already gone to sleep when four bandits suddenly broke into the house, tied up the family members, both male and female, and looted everything. They stole all the rice, clothes, and money and loaded them onto the boat docked on the riverbank. Just as they were about to escape, they were discovered by neighbors, who immediately beat gongs and gathered to pursue them. The bandits hurriedly rowed the boat to the opposite bank, but they had already alarmed Zou Xinzhuo, the head of Beidu Township, and more than ten villagers, including Yang Errong, Hua Guilin, and Hua Xinggen, who divided up and surrounded them. Seeing that there were many people surrounding them, the bandits abandoned their loot and landed, hiding in the wheat fields. When Zou and others chased them, they saw that the boat was empty and the bandits had fled. They searched everywhere until the next morning when they captured the four bandits, Xue Keming, Ma Futang, Gu Jiaquan, and Zhao Linchang, in the wheat fields. They were immediately taken to the office of the security regiment. Under interrogation, they confessed that they had been involved in robberies in Wuxian County. They immediately telegraphed the County Public Security Bureau, which sent investigator Luo Shaoxiang and others to the township to escort the four bandits to the city. A steel bar, a fake Mauser pistol, and many stolen items of clothing were found in the bandit boat. The case has been reported to Director X for investigation, and the bandit boat has been handed over to the village head for safekeeping.</p>

<p>In order to facilitate the operation of railroad vehicles throughout the country, the Ministry of Railways immediately ordered Lu Weiyan, the chief of the Changzhou-Danyang-Suzhou section of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, to order the stationmasters of each station to actively plan and rectify. After receiving the order, Li Guisheng, the stationmaster of Wuxi Station, argued that Wuxi Station had more vehicles than other stations, and that the loading and unloading of goods by merchants was also not small. Therefore, he proposed to add a track of about five or six zhang from Yangqi in Dongli to the original Yangqi in the west of Fenlu. The roadbed has already been built. Steel rails and sleepers have been continuously transported to Wuxi by the Engineering Department and will be laid in the coming days. It is also hoped that the Wangting and Henglin stations will also add tracks at the same time. In addition, according to the report of the Dispatching Section of the Engineering Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway Administration, the existing long-distance telephones in various stations of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway are extremely busy when dispatching vehicles, and it is necessary to add dedicated dispatching telephones so that the original long-distance telephones are not obstructed. The Railway Administration ordered the Shanghai Engineering Department to be responsible for the preparations. Twenty new-style telephones have been prepared and will be installed first in Shanghai and Changzhou stations. Wuxi Station will also need to install them soon.

<h3 id="e108">Small Credit Loans: Changes in the Distribution of Amounts <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>Banks Confirm 1.5 Million, Money Shops Also Decide on 1 Million</p>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, regarding the 5 million yuan loan for the relief of industry and commerce jointly organized by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, as well as the banking and money shop associations, since Minister of Finance Kong invited financial circles to a tea party a few days ago to exchange opinions and urge its implementation, the amounts undertaken by each party have been changed. The Banking Association held a special meeting yesterday to discuss it, and the Money Shop Association will also hold a meeting in the coming days to discuss and formally implement it. The timeline for this should not be far off. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Redistribution of Confirmed Amounts: Regarding the 5 million yuan loan for the relief of industry and commerce jointly organized by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, as well as the banking and money shop associations, after receiving the instructions and ten principles from the Ministry of Finance, it has not been implemented due to the ongoing discussions on the loan amounts undertaken by each party. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi specifically invited representatives from Shanghai's financial circles to a tea party at his residence last Saturday. Responsible persons from the banking and money shop associations, such as Ye Fu, Qin Runqing, etc., attended. After exchanging opinions, it was decided that the Central Bank and Bank of China would each commit 1 million yuan, and the Bank of Communications would commit 500,000 yuan, totaling 2.5 million yuan for the three banks. In addition, the Banking Association would commit 1.5 million yuan, and the Money Shop Association would commit 1 million yuan.</p>
<p>Suspension of the Subcommittee: The Banking Association previously, in response to the requests of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Local Association, and Shanghai's industrial and commercial circles, handled credit loans. A subcommittee was established, and member banks were notified to confirm the loan amounts undertaken. The Bank of China committed 1 million yuan, the Bank of Communications committed 400,000 yuan, and other banks committed 475,000 yuan, totaling 1,875,000 yuan. However, after Minister Kong convened a meeting with banking circles and decided to expand the program, the subcommittee suspended its activities to participate in the larger initiative. It was originally intended to incorporate the amounts already committed by each bank, and a meeting was convened to decide to send Ye Fu and Wang Yansong, two standing committee members, as representatives. The result of Minister Kong's subsequent convening of a meeting to distribute the amounts has resulted in changes. Since the 1.4 million yuan already committed by the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications will be put forward, the association convened another meeting yesterday to discuss the distribution of amounts among the banks.</p>
<p>Resolution of the Banking Association Yesterday: The Banking Association specifically convened its 67th Executive Committee meeting at 1:30 PM yesterday, and invited all member banks to attend. Executive Committee members Ye Fu, Wang Yansong, Xu Jiqing, Wang Zhixin, Qu Jigang, etc., and representatives from all member banks, totaling more than 30 people, attended. Ye Fu was unanimously elected as chairman. After the formalities, Ye Fuxiao first reported on the proceedings of the tea party attended by Minister Kong and the revised distribution of amounts. Of the amount already committed by the Banking Association, excluding the Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, only 475,000 yuan was available. It was resolved on how to raise the remaining 1.5 million yuan: (1) Each member bank of the Banking Association will commit 1 million yuan, and those that have already committed will be notified to double their commitment. (2) Banks that have not committed or have committed a smaller amount will be requested to commit or increase their commitment. (3) For the remaining 500,000 yuan, the Ministry of Finance will be requested to negotiate with non-member banks to commit. (4) Ye Fuxiao and Wang Yansong, two standing committee members, will be appointed to report to the Minister of Finance. Next, Secretary-General Lin Kanghou reported on the recent negotiations regarding the Post Office's restriction on attaching letters to remittances. It was resolved to notify all member banks: (1) to comply with the Postal Regulations, and (2) to use remittance slips instead of attached letters to the greatest extent possible. The meeting adjourned around 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Money Shops Will Also Hold Meetings to Discuss: As for the money shops, the previous meeting of member representatives resolved to agree to participate and decided that each member money shop would commit an equal share, totaling 250,000 yuan. Minister Kong's tea party requested an increase to 1 million yuan. The association will also convene a meeting to report and discuss ways to increase the commitment. However, the meeting date has not yet been decided. It is heard that after substantial contact is made regarding the distribution of amounts by each party, a meeting will be scheduled to discuss implementation. When formally implemented, a committee will be formed according to the provisions of Articles 9 and 10 of the principles promulgated by the Ministry of Finance to preside over it. The Ministry of Finance may also appoint representatives to participate.</p>

<p>According to a Central News Agency report from Nanjing on the 6th, the Executive Yuan approved that the various banks with official shares, which previously established branches in Liaoning and other places, suffered significant losses.

<h3 id="e111">National Federation of Commerce Plans to Establish a Commercial Joint Bank, with Each Store Contributing Five Yuan <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, previously received a letter from the Guangdong Chamber of Commerce advocating that the National Federation of Commerce initiate the organization of a Commercial Joint Bank to concentrate strength and circulate finance. Mr. Lin then sent letters to chambers of commerce across the country to solicit opinions. He has now received replies of support from the chambers of commerce in Hubei and other provinces. Mr. Lin is drafting organizational laws and plans for raising shares. The motivation and implementation methods of the initiative are as follows:</p>
<p>Motivation: According to the person in charge of the federation, in recent years, China's economy has been declining, and commerce has been sluggish. Although the reasons are multifaceted, they are mainly due to the invasion of foreign goods and the collapse of the rural economy. Exhaustion has not occurred overnight. Recently, the global economic downturn and the impact of silver policies have further dealt a major blow. At this critical time for the survival of the commercial economy, there is no way to reverse the decline without uniting in spirit and concentrating strength. Therefore, it is proposed to unite the chambers of commerce of various provinces and cities across the country in order to establish the most powerful financial institution and devote itself to the relief of commerce and the rural economy.</p>
<p>Implementation Methods: The implementation method is to require each member store of the local chambers of commerce to subscribe for a minimum of five yuan as a necessary condition. With the large number of chambers of commerce and member stores across the country, it is enough to accumulate little by little to easily establish a Commercial Joint Bank with strong capital. Moreover, this method is most suitable for modern commercial economic principles. China has a vast territory, and transportation is inconvenient. In addition to the major cities, there are many places where the remittance network is not accessible, so the economy cannot be active and commerce cannot develop. If the Commercial Joint Bank is established, then wherever there is a chamber of commerce in the country, that is where the economic power reaches. Even in remote areas, ways can be found to circulate finance, and this can be used to unify the connections of merchants, which will greatly benefit the future of commerce and the adjustment of the rural economy. Everything is interconnected.</p>

<p>Lending 1.8 Million to the Construction Department, Rejection of Silk Cocoon Merchants' Request</p>
<p>Due to the sluggish overseas sales of silk in recent years, the Zhejiang Provincial Construction Department controlled the collection of cocoons throughout the province last year, dividing it into sixteen districts. The Construction Department occupied six districts, and Zhejiang silk cocoon merchants occupied four districts. This year, as spring cocoons are about to mature, Director Zeng Yangfu of the Zhejiang Construction Department and Director of Finance, etc., have come to Shanghai several times to negotiate with the syndicate for a loan of six million yuan to be used for cocoon collection. After discussions, the syndicate decided to lend 1.8 million yuan. The loan contract will be signed soon. Regarding the loan requested by the Zhejiang Provincial Silk Cocoon Industry Association, the syndicate has replied to the association, asking it to borrow from the Zhejiang Construction Department.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Joint Office Operation by the Municipal Government: Still Difficult in Practice <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, in order to simplify operations, the Municipal Government plans to implement a joint office system. Mayor Wu has instructed the Secretariat to draft measures. According to a responsible person of the Municipal Government, some provinces have already implemented joint office operation. However, the provincial governments and departments in various provinces are mostly supervisory in nature. The Municipal Government's business is complex. In addition to supervising subordinate agencies, it also performs executive functions. Therefore, joint office operation is still difficult in practice. The current plan is to first eliminate redundant agencies to save public funds, while striving for simplicity in operations. Therefore, the Municipal Government's joint office operation focuses on achieving results in spirit.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Lawyers Association: Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>The Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee of the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China issued a declaration yesterday stating: "In accordance with the resolution of the Sixth Congress of Representatives, the Association has organized the Wrongful Imprisonment Compensation Movement Committee to seek the realization of a national compensation system. From the beginning of the movement, public opinion has been greatly in favor. Now, at the plenary committee meeting held in Suzhou, after detailed discussion, it is believed that the legal community nationwide should concentrate its efforts and proceed in unison to meet the requirements of social justice and promote the country's fulfillment of its moral and legal obligations. Considering modern civilized countries, since the end of the 19th century, with the changes of the times and the advancement of the theory of corporate responsibility, in terms of public and private law, it is common practice to provide compensation to the people for damages caused by the exercise of power by government agencies. The wrongful imprisonment compensation system is also based on the two kinds of responsibilities of the state in public and private law. The legislative examples include those that have enacted special laws, such as Germany and Austria, those that have stipulated it in the Criminal Procedure Law, such as France and Italy, and those that have established it as a precedent, such as England and the United States. Although the forms vary, it is always the same that the state should be responsible for compensating innocent citizens for improper damages caused by the exercise of power by its judicial organs, whether due to the pure official actions of judicial officials or the illegal actions of judicial officials taking advantage of their positions. Looking back at our country, the wrongful imprisonment compensation system, after the Qin and Han Dynasties, ultimately could not eliminate wrongful imprisonments, so it severely punished those who caused them, based on the principle of retribution. Emperor Gaozong of the Song Dynasty provided money and rice to those who were innocently released to return home, reducing the material losses suffered by the innocent due to the improper actions of state organs. However, the idea of state compensation was not established as a regular law. The Ming Law had provisions for the perpetrator to compensate the victim's property. However, for wrongful imprisonments caused by judicial misconduct, the state was never held responsible for compensation. This kind of legislative example, which expresses autocratic thought, continued from the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China without any change. Recently, the judicial system has not yet reached perfection, and although there are many judicial officials who are respected for their integrity, incorruptibility, law-abidingness, and impartiality, there are also many who are immoral, greedy for wealth, or have shallow knowledge and make hasty judgments. As a result, innocent people are wrongly accused, and their cries go unheard. How many of our people have been ruined and killed because of this! How many have been demoralized and unable to recover! A stroke of the pen in the courtroom, a thousand drops of blood below. This kind of tragic phenomenon still exists in 20th century China. What is the misfortune of the people like? The Association, mindful of the teachings of the weakness of the law and deeply concerned about the resentment of the courts, takes advantage of the opportunity of the chief judicial officer to rectify the system and discipline the officials, and is determined to realize the wrongful imprisonment compensation system to protect the right to life of our people and to improve the organization of our country. A country is an organic whole. If its constituent elements cannot pursue their legitimate survival, it is no different from the cells of the human body losing their physiological nutrition. If the cells do not receive nourishment, the person is injured. If the constituent elements are not protected in their survival, the country will not be a country. Therefore, the Association advocates that the state should compensate for wrongful imprisonments not only for the individual, but also to protect individuals for the sake of the country, and to protect its constituent elements. In other words, the Association's advocacy of wrongful imprisonment compensation is not subject to the legal thought of individualistic tendencies, but is subject to the legal thought of socialistic tendencies. This is especially what the Association must solemnly tell the people of our country. People of the country, would you like to sympathize with this movement of the Association and help it to be realized quickly? The Association is willing to work together with you to achieve it."</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Guangdong Provincial Government Observation Group, consisting of eleven people, after arriving in Shanghai, has been inspecting in various places in Shanghai for several days. Yesterday morning, the group went to the Commercial Press on Henan Road and the Meya Silk Weaving Factory for inspection. In the afternoon, they visited the Industrial and Educational Group hosted by Tao Zhi-xing. At 7:00 PM, Lin Baisheng hosted a banquet at the New Asia Restaurant.

<p>The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Association dispatched members yesterday morning, accompanied by representatives of overseas Chinese in Siam who have returned to the country to petition, introduced by Chaozhou rice merchants stationed in Shanghai, to the Grain Industry Association and the Bean and Rice Industry Association to report to Chairman Gu Xinyi and Standing Committee members Chen Ziyu and Zhu Zixiang on the various illegal acts of the Siamese government to oppress overseas Chinese and the suffering of the overseas Chinese, requesting Shanghai rice merchants to boycott the import of Siamese rice in order to promote the awareness of that country. They left at 12:00 PM. The two groups, Grain and Bean Rice, specifically scheduled a meeting of the entire executive supervisory committee at 4:00 PM this afternoon to discuss implementation measures. However, according to people familiar with the situation in Siam, the number of overseas Chinese in Siam accounts for seven-tenths of the Siamese population, and most of them are engaged in commerce and agriculture. If a "boycott" is implemented, it will directly affect the overseas Chinese, and this should be considered. At the same time, the price of Siamese rice at the place of origin exceeds the price sold in the Chinese market by more than one yuan per dan. In recent months, imports have been greatly reduced.</p>

<p>Municipal Farmers' Association Issues a Letter to All Farmers in the City, Farmers' Associations in Various Districts Conduct Recreational Promotions Separately, Literacy School Teachers to Take Exams on the 10th</p>
<p>Today is the last day of the Literacy Movement Promotion Week in the city, which is Farmers' Promotion Day. The Municipal Farmers' Association leads farmers' associations in various districts to organize promotion teams and hold recreational gatherings. The Municipal Farmers' Association also issues a letter to all farmers in the city, detailing the various situations as follows:</p>
<p>Academic Promotion: Yesterday was Academic Promotion Day. All schools in the city, in addition to the principals of each school reporting on the meaning of literacy education during Memorial Week, also organized promotion teams of students to promote to the public in busy areas and distributed literacy promotion pictures and leaflets on the spot.</p>
<p>Teacher Examination Date: The deadline for registration for the association's recruitment of literacy school teachers was yesterday. A total of more than 900 people registered. The oral exam is scheduled for the 10th of this month and the written exam on the 11th. The location is Aurora University on Rue Labbé. An examination committee has been organized to preside over the exams.</p>
<p>Letter to the Educational Community: The Municipal Education Association issued a letter to colleagues in the educational community yesterday as follows: "We should all know that the current stage of the Chinese National Revolution is the "Construction Period", and the literacy education movement is the core of the construction work. Because China has more than 80% illiteracy and 10% semi-illiteracy (that is, although they know how to read, they lack common sense and civic training), it is undoubtedly lacking in theoretical basis and too far from the facts to ask them to shoulder the mission of building the country and benefiting society. Since the establishment of the first session of the Association, it has first noticed this most basic literacy education, created a one-yuan-a-month education movement, established many public schools, and educated thousands of illiterate people, and is still continuing to do so. However, we regret that we do not have many people and have limited ability. The one-yuan-a-month education movement has only achieved a very small effect on our ideals. Fortunately, the Municipal Government has launched a large-scale literacy education movement, aiming to eliminate illiteracy in the city within a year and make them all healthy citizens. This is the revolutionary process of the planning period, and this is a pioneering initiative of the literacy movement that has never been done before. On the occasion of the Academic Promotion Literacy Education Movement Day, the colleagues of the Association extend the following four hopes to the comrades in the educational community throughout the city: (1) Starting from today, every student should teach at least one illiterate person to read, for a period of two months, and then continue to teach. Teachers and staff in schools should gather them for training from time to time, and instill a lot of civic common sense. (2) Students in secondary schools and above should set up more public schools to provide literacy education, common sense guidance, and civic training. (3) School authorities should fully provide convenience for promoting the literacy education movement, both materially and spiritually. (4) School janitors, guards, and other workers in the school should first be encouraged to become literate in order to advocate for it. The above four points are the minimum duties that colleagues in the educational community should fulfill in promoting the literacy education movement. Because we can read and have knowledge and enjoy a unique cultural life, how can we not be served by a large group of hardworking people in society? In order to repay their kindness and fulfill our national duty, we must quickly get up and work hard to promote the literacy education movement."</p>
<p>Farmers' Promotion: Today is Farmers' Promotion Day. The South Shanghai District Farmers' Association and the Gaohang District Association held a recreational promotion meeting for literacy. The South Shanghai District's program included a drama by the New Farmers' Theater, a costumed speech by the Juvenile Speech Group, and magic. The Gaohang District's program included harmonica by the China Harmonica Association, Chinese martial arts by the Chinese Martial Arts Research Society, and a drama by Peiying Primary School. Farmers' associations in other districts organized promotion teams to go to the countryside to promote literacy. At the same time, literacy promotion was held during the Spring Plowing Movement Conference held in Yangsi District today. The Municipal Farmers' Association also plans to convene a discussion meeting with the cadres of farmers' associations in various districts to discuss the establishment of literacy schools in various districts.</p>
<p>Letter to Farmers: The Municipal Farmers' Association issued a letter to all farmers in the city as follows: "Dear farmers, do you know how many illiterate people there are in China? Can you imagine how painful those illiterate people are? Can you also imagine that because there are too many illiterate people in China, the country is weak and the people are poor? According to surveys and statistics, in every hundred Chinese people, about eighty are illiterate. Farmers account for a large part of these many illiterate people. If we compare this situation with foreign countries, it is naturally very different. Because in today's world, there is no country like China with so many illiterate people. In various parts of Japan, even rickshaw drivers and farmers can read and like to read the daily newspaper, so they can be strong. How painful it is for a person not to be literate! They cannot write, they cannot calculate, and they will not know ordinary common sense. How can they understand domestic politics and the international situation? Even their own farming affairs, such as new knowledge and new technologies, cannot be known or improved. Why? Because these all require the power of writing to be known. Not knowing how to read is painful. Dear farmers, it is really painful not to be literate, like a blind man with open eyes. If farmers do not know how to read, they will not be able to obtain all kinds of new agricultural knowledge, and agriculture will never progress. Now about 80% of the people in China are illiterate, so the lack of progress in all undertakings in China is inevitable. Therefore, it is an urgent matter to make many of our compatriots literate. Now the city's literacy movement is being actively launched. This is good news for our illiterate compatriots, and it is also the good news for our farmers, who account for the largest number of illiterate people. We demand the knowledge of writing, we demand the knowledge of all kinds of common sense needed in our lives, and we demand that we can be good citizens. Therefore, we should enthusiastically promote this great literacy movement. In the near future, dozens of schools will be established in various districts of the city. At that time, everyone who is illiterate will have to go to these schools to learn to read, reading for one hour a day. Tuition is free and books are given away. After graduating in two months, they will be able to keep accounts, write letters, and read simple newspapers. How convenient! If they really cannot go to school to study, then teachers will come to their homes to teach them in person. And after two months, if they pass the exam, they can also graduate. It is hoped that the dear farmers will unite to participate in this movement. It is hoped that the illiterate farmers will quickly go to literacy schools to study. This is not only to increase the daily knowledge and life of the illiterate farmers, but also a major key to reviving the countryside and improving the national status. Farmers, unite!"</p>

<p>Report by British Army Commander Brigadier General Crake</p>
<p>The Shanghai Commercial Corps was reviewed by Brigadier General Crake, commander of the British garrison in Shanghai, on the 27th of last month. The Brigadier General has prepared a report to the Chairman of the Public Works Department as follows: "I am pleased to submit a report on the inspection of the Shanghai Commercial Corps on April 27th. Over the past year, the commander of the corps has given me the convenience of inspecting the training of the various detachments of the corps. I was able to inspect the evening exercises of the various teams and participate in the mobilization plan. I feel that the training is very dedicated, and all members are able to pay attention to their work. The mobilization plan is very practical and satisfactory. On April 27th, the marching pace and discipline of the various teams were excellent. The commander of the corps has told me about the reorganization of the corps into a brigade. This move requires increasing his staff. I believe that increasing personnel is necessary. The commander only has one permanent officer to assist him, and it is impossible to properly and interestingly train the various teams composed of people from various countries. I have had the opportunity to inspect the headquarters of the corps and all administrative and reserve arrangements, and I feel that they are all worthy of praise, and their emergency preparations are very thorough."</p>

<h3 id="e126">Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Cables Southwest Political Committee Requesting Suspension of National Special Tax on Domestic Agricultural Products <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>How can we divide ourselves within the same country, and there should be no more existence of distorted tax systems.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce yesterday telegraphed the Southwest Political Affairs Committee in Guangzhou, the Guangdong Provincial Government, the Guangdong Department of Finance, and the Guangdong Provincial Party Headquarters (titles omitted). According to a letter from the Miscellaneous Grains and Oilseed Cake Industry Association on the 4th of this month, based on a letter from the Lyu Lan Business Miscellaneous Grain Help Shenshou Hall on April 26th, and a letter from the Guangzhou Peanut Sesame Miscellaneous Grain Industry Association, the Guangdong Department of Finance has been collecting taxes on peanuts, sesame, and other oilseeds at a rate of $1.80 per load for various beans and peanut kernels, $1.50 per load for shelled peanuts, and $3.50 per load for peanut oil and soybean oil, effective April 21st, which is unbearable for merchants. They requested an appeal. An examination of the special tax bureau for imported agricultural products and miscellaneous items established in Guangzhou in 1933 showed that regulations stipulated that domestic products were tax-exempt. Peanuts and oil transported to Guangdong come from Shandong, Henan, Hebei, Jiangsu, and other provinces and are purely domestic products, not imported goods. Not long after, the Guangdong authorities started collecting taxes in the name of “educating the countryside.” Now, taxes have been reimposed, which not only benefits imported products but also, during this period of commercial decline and economic hardship, how can businesses bear this heavy burden? This also greatly affects the domestic sale of agricultural products. Therefore, we earnestly request your association to telegraph the Guangdong Southwest Political Affairs Committee, the Provincial Government, the Department of Finance, and the Provincial and Municipal Party Headquarters to consider the difficulties of merchants and the livelihood of the people and immediately abolish this tax. We also request that you appeal to the city chamber of commerce to show public spirit. According to this, the Guangdong province has been collecting special taxes on imported agricultural products for years, and domestic products are tax-exempt. Not for a year, it suddenly taxed domestic agricultural products in the name of saving the countryside. Now, it also heavily taxes peanut oil and beans transported from Yilu, Yu, and Su provinces to Guangdong. The policies have been inconsistent over the past two years, leaving farmers and merchants unable to bear the burden. In addition to telegraphed the Guangdong Provincial authorities to abolish it, we must also prepare letters to inform you, hoping that you will investigate and grant a unified appeal to enrich public morality and other matters. An investigation of the Guangdong Provincial Agricultural Special Tax Bureau shows that when it was first established, it was limited to imported goods, and it should not have changed its purpose to tax domestic goods. If it is to save the countryside, then Guangdong province is within the Chinese territory, and the bankruptcy of rural areas is a common phenomenon in all provinces. Why create divisions and harm one to benefit the other? Now that the transit taxes in various places are about to be abolished on a regular basis, within the same country, there should be no more existence of distorted systems of domestic passage tax. Guangdong province is setting an example of reforming various policies for the country and should not repeat this bad policy to be criticized. If other provinces also use saving their own agricultural products as an excuse to heavily tax the import of Guangdong's special products, how can Guangdong remain silent? The principle of loyalty and forgiveness is a good plan for collecting taxes and a key to national development.

<p>According to the Guomin News Agency, the Hangzhou Guanghua Match Factory, founded solely by Zhejiang gentry Tang Shouqian, was the first self-made match factory in China. Since its establishment, it has been a giant in the Chinese match industry for decades and the largest producer in the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui unified tax area. The factory currently has more than 400 male workers and 700 female workers, totaling more than 1,000 people, and the scale can be imagined. Last year, match production was 32,643.6 cases, and the production volume in the previous year was 43,507.7 cases. Compared to each other, last year's production volume has been greatly reduced.</p>
<p>Formally merged in The factory has been experiencing difficulty in recent years due to competition from peers, resulting in a backlog of products and difficulty in selling them. Prices have also fallen tragically, making it difficult to maintain operations. Furthermore, increased unified taxes have made business even more difficult. Therefore, in July of last year, it joined Dachanghua Match Co., Ltd. Now, it has formally merged into Dachanghua Match Company and has submitted documents for change of registration and trademark transfer to the Ministry of Industry for registration.</p>

<p>The French Concession Shanghai Second Special District Citizens' Union, because the French authorities often do not follow legal procedures and arbitrarily search residents, causing citizens to feel uneasy, had once sent personnel with letters to visit the French Consul General, requesting handling of various matters, which has been reported in the previous newspapers. To date, there has been no response. The association specially sent letters again to the French Minister and the French Consul General yesterday, requesting prompt correction and hoping for a sincere response. The original text of the two letters is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Letter to the French Minister: Respectfully opening, the case is that this association had previously reported, based on a joint report from the sub-district associations, that due to the recent market depression and business bankruptcies, the concession authorities arbitrarily increased donations and taxes and abused penalties, requesting relief. This association had listed the facts and sent a letter to your country's Consul General in Shanghai for investigation and handling, but after many days, there has been no response, which is a great disappointment to the citizens within the concession. Considering that the relations between China and France have always been cordial, this association is making the lowest possible demands in order to relieve the suffering of merchants and people, but it has been uniformly rejected, which is very regrettable. Now, in order to take into account the relations between the two countries, this association is unwilling to cause adverse effects on both sides due to trivial matters. The full district representative assembly on April 27 resolved to describe the suffering of the citizens and sent a letter to your minister for review (attached six major points omitted). The above points are the most recent discoveries of the facts, please your minister quickly order the Consul General in Shanghai to seek correction measures in order to appease the merchants and people and promote friendship, and hope to see a reply.</p>

This association had listed the facts and on April 20 publicly elected five directors, Mao Yun, Wang Shunfa, Li Weiliang, Qu Zhenhua, and Zhu Wenqi, to take a letter to request investigation and handling, but after many days, there has been no reply, which is deeply surprising.

<p>A Westerner, Hagens, residing at No. 17 Fuen Road in the French Concession, previously reported to the Jing'an Temple police station by telephone, saying that his hired domestic servant, Wu Ruqing from Hebei, was suspected of colluding with others to privately manufacture the narcotic morphine. He requested an investigation. The Chinese detective Shi Sijian went to investigate and arrested Wu first. He was then taken to the morphine factory at No. 12 Pushi Road, where Pan Zhenlin, Liu Zhongxian, Zhao Jianqiu, Li Deyuan, Zhao Wu's wife, and others were apprehended.

<h3 id="e136">This Year's Fishing Season Peaceful on the Ocean Surface <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>However, the market price is falling, and the profits are much lower.</p>
<p>According to reports from various patrol ships of the Fisheries Protection Office of the Ministry of Industry, this year's fishing season in Jiangsu and Zhejiang has been exceptionally peaceful. A total of five patrol ships have been dispatched to the fishing areas of Shengshan, Xiangshan, Shimen, Zhenhai, Ningbo Port, Dinghai, Huawu, and Shenjiamen. Due to the strict patrols, pirates have disappeared, and the ocean surface is peaceful. However, this year the price of small yellow croaker has fallen. At the end of April, the selling price per load was 60 cents to 1 yuan, and at most, it did not exceed 2 yuan. Many fishermen, believing that the price was too low, pickled salted goods and transported them to various places for sale. Therefore, the profits of fishermen this year are much lower than in previous years. The reason for the low price is that the discovery of fish schools was too late, which did not meet the timeliness. The Central News Agency reporter also inquired in detail with the person in charge of the Jiangzhe Cuttlefish Trap-netting dispute, which has been pending for years. According to reports, fishermen in Zhejiang Province all use trap-netting, while fishermen in Jiangsu Province use nets. If it is based on hindering reproduction, then the harm is equal. However, when trap-netting, the fish spawn in the traps. Because the walls of the traps are too dense, the eggs stick to the four sides of the traps. When they are taken out of the water, they are exposed to air, which causes the eggs to become infertile, causing more damage. When net-fishing, the eggs spawn in the nets, and the eggs are scattered in the sea and can survive. If they stick to the edges of the nets and are taken out of the water, the eggs will also be infertile, and the damage is less. However, according to Zhejiang Province fishermen, the windlass on the edges of the nets shakes and rotates on the seabed, which can also crush fish eggs, which is the same as trap-netting. This is the focus of the dispute. In short, trap-netting and net-fishing both have the harm of reducing production and cannot be denied. It remains to be studied whether there is a danger of extinction of fish species. The question of banning trap-netting, because it affects the lives of fishermen in Zhejiang Province, still needs to be considered. This is a pending case. To solve it, we must still explore the root of the problem in the fishing method to avoid hindering the main issue under the principle of reproduction.</p>

<h3 id="e138">Jiangxi Guangda Porcelain Factory: Promoters' Meeting <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>Share payments limited to the end of May; Inaugural meeting scheduled for June 8th</p>
<p>The Jiangxi Guangda Porcelain Factory, since last year, had 200,000 yuan allocated by the Jiangxi Provincial Government as initial capital. The remaining 800,000 yuan was to be raised by Mr. Du Chongyuan. Since the fundraising and preparation began, progress has been reported in this newspaper. Regarding the Shanghai share payments, due to tight financial conditions among Shanghai merchants, although 400,000 yuan in commercial shares had been raised, they could not be fully paid up immediately. When Mr. Du Chongyuan returned to Jiangxi at the beginning of last month, Minister Kong, Li Shizeng, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Gongquan, and leaders from Shanghai's financial and industrial circles jointly sent a letter to Jiangxi Chairman Xiong Tianyi, reporting on the Shanghai share fundraising situation, with Kong, Li, Du, and Zhang undertaking to collect the 400,000 yuan in share payments and remit them within a short period. After Mr. Du Chongyuan returned to Jiangxi, he surveyed factory sites, supervised factory construction, and trained workers, preparing to commence operations. Recently, with factory affairs arranged, he returned to Shanghai to discuss the collection of share payments with the promoters. Yesterday, at 1 PM, Minister Kong, Song Ziwen, Mayor Wu, Li Shizeng, Zhang Xiaolin, Du Yuesheng, Zhou Zuomin, Qian Xinzhi, Zhang Gongquan, Xu Jiying, Wu Yunzhai, and Du Chongyuan, among others, hosted a banquet at the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road for the shareholders, with over twenty guests in attendance. It was resolved that all share payments must be made in full by the end of this month, and the inaugural meeting would be held on June 8th. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Minister Kong's Speech: Westerners call porcelain "China." If we cherish porcelain, it is equivalent to loving our country. Jiangxi's porcelain industry was once world-renowned, but due to a lack of innovation, it gradually fell behind, allowing foreign porcelain to increasingly penetrate the market. The extent of the outflow of wealth is alarming. However, due to a lack of specialized talent, improvement was impossible. The year before last, Mr. Du Chongyuan came to Shanghai, proposing a plan to establish a large-scale porcelain factory in China. Mr. Du originally ran a porcelain factory in the Northeast with excellent results. Within a few years, he managed to suppress foreign porcelain to the point where it could not be sold. I believe everyone is familiar with Mr. Du's experience in establishing a porcelain factory in the Northeast, so I won't reintroduce it. Fortunately, the Jiangxi Provincial Government, because the Red bandits within the province were suppressed last year, strived for construction and very much wanted to improve the Jiangxi porcelain industry. I then introduced Mr. Du to Jiangxi to discuss the matter. The Jiangxi Provincial Government, despite financial difficulties, was able to allocate 200,000 yuan from the provincial treasury to start the porcelain factory, which is truly commendable. Since everyone in Shanghai was previously supportive, I hope everyone will continue to encourage each other and pay up their shares as soon as possible, so that the fundraising can be completed and the company can open early. This is not a solicitation for donations. When the porcelain factory is established in the future, everyone will benefit. For example, the porcelain used in the International Hotel is entirely foreign-made. This is not only an economic outflow, but also a disgrace to our production sector. I hope that when the shareholders of our Guangda Porcelain Factory come to the International Hotel for meetings in the future, the porcelain used will be entirely from the Guangda Porcelain Factory. Now, I would like to invite Mr. Du Chongyuan to report.</p>
<p>Mr. Du's Report: Mr. Du Chongyuan rose and reported, stating, "Minister Kong has already spoken generally about the importance of the porcelain industry and the establishment of the porcelain factory. I also gave a more detailed report at the previous World Society meeting. What I want to report now is a brief review of the changes during the factory establishment period and the recent situation. I originally planned to establish a porcelain factory in Shanghai, initiated by Mr. Li Shizeng and Mr. Zhang Gongquan to raise shares. Later, because Minister Kong introduced me to Jiangxi, I canceled the original plan. During the negotiations with the Jiangxi Provincial Government, the Jiangxi Provincial Government initially advocated for government supervision and commercial operation, then government-commercial joint operation, and finally decided on complete commercial operation. As for the allocation of shares, the Jiangxi Provincial Government allocated 200,000 yuan as commercial shares, and I was responsible for raising the remaining 800,000 yuan. In the winter of last year, I raised 200,000 yuan in the Pingjin area and planned to raise 400,000 yuan in Shanghai, with the remaining 200,000 yuan to be raised in Hankou, Changsha, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces. Now, the Jiangxi Provincial Government has allocated more than 200,000 yuan, and most of the share payments from various parties have been received. The 400,000 yuan in Shanghai shares have not been paid up because this year is a period of unusually tight financial conditions, unlike previous years. When I returned to Jiangxi last time, I discussed with the promoters and was instructed to return to Jiangxi first to prepare everything, and the share payments would be paid later. After I returned to Jiangxi, I began to reorganize Jiangxi porcelain through the Pottery Industry Administration and transferred important staff from the Northeast Porcelain Factory to plan and arrange everything. This time, my return to Shanghai is short, and I cannot negotiate everywhere, which I regret very much. As for how to raise the share payments, everyone present today is an important leader in the financial and industrial sectors, and I hope we can jointly agree on a solution, which I greatly appreciate."</p>
<p>Resolutions: After discussion among the promoters and shareholders, three resolutions were passed: (1) All share payments must be paid in full before the end of May. (2) The collection of share payments will be the responsibility of Zhang Gongquan, Qian Xinzhi, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, and Li Shizeng. (3) The inaugural meeting will be held at 2 PM on June 8th at the World Society at 393 Fookaisen Road. All of the above resolutions were passed and will be implemented separately. The meeting adjourned at 3 PM.</p>

<p>The City Health Bureau recently received an order from the Municipal Government, which relayed a telegram from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: "It has been found that in various provinces and cities, Western doctors and dentists without licenses are practicing medicine, which is extremely harmful to the health of the people. Suppression should be carried out swiftly. In particular, those who engage in tooth filling while operating other businesses, as well as medical clinics that are neither fish nor fowl, should be strictly ordered. Local public security bureau chiefs and health authorities should be responsible for personally inspecting them once a week to check whether all their equipment and instruments are clean and legal. If there are any violations, they should be corrected immediately if minor, and severely punished if major. I hope you will instruct your subordinates to strictly comply." After receiving the order, the Bureau immediately complied and agreed with the Public Security Bureau on a date to dispatch personnel to conduct strict inspections in various parts of the city. It is reported that in the past two weeks, in the area from Zhonghua Road to Minguo Road, Zhao Hongsheng, claiming to be a traditional Chinese medicine doctor but without a license, was found to be illegally practicing medicine at Yongchuntang in Baoguan Lane inside Xiaodongmen, advertising treatment for venereal diseases and injecting "606" and "914" brands. Traditional Chinese medicine doctors Bu Hongyin and Chang Molin were also found in the Zhonghua Road area, posing as Western doctors, advertising treatment for venereal diseases, and injecting patients. Liu Genfu, Li Guiqing, Hua Meili, and others were found in Zhaojia Road and Penglai Road engaged in unlicensed tooth plating. All have been ordered to cease operations or severely punished as a warning.</p>

<p>Sun Baobao Repeatedly Impersonating; Suspect Under Investigation</p>
<p>Gao Xueqiao, a performer at the Gongwutai Theater in the French Concession, and Chen Hefeng, a performer at the Datutai Theater, have recently had their names impersonated to defraud Beshixin Shoe Store and various costume shops of shoes, costumes, and other items. False signatures and stamps were used on cards, instructing recipients to collect payment from the backstage. After Gao Xueqiao discovered this, he issued a statement in the newspaper. Unexpectedly, the swindler brazenly continued to deceive in secret. Yesterday afternoon, at approximately 2 PM, the swindler went to the Jinghuatang Gift Shop in the Chenghuangmiao area to deceive them into giving him red satin. Because the shop had previously been deceived by a fake Mr. Gao, they questioned him, and he revealed his deceit. They summoned police officer Wu Guangzhen from post #4 and brought him to the Chenghuangmiao Police Station for investigation. According to Director Liu's interrogation, the defendant's name is Baobao, 24 years old, from Pudong, and he is a mahjong player, residing at 27 Shenjiazhen, Yangshupu. Last month, he impersonated Gao Xueqiao and defrauded Xie Feng, a ceremonial banner shop, out of two red satin banners, and also defrauded the Twelfth Floor restaurant out of three bolts of red satin, which were accompanied by apprentice Chen Chunsheng to the Yong'an Gift Shop on Sanma Road. He then escaped through the back door. He also obtained two Xiang brand mirror frames and gave them to the Guangdong Grand Theater. Later, he discussed with Chen that he wanted to perform a comedic play that required 100 sets of Western suits and watches, but Chen did not have that many Western suits. He was deceived out of two gold watches, and Cao Wangshi was deceived out of a treasure ring and a raincoat, among other things. After Director Liu immediately summoned the victim Gao Xueqiao, represented by Yang Wenshan, as well as the performer Chen Hefeng, Wang Hongfu of Xie Feng, Chen Yulin of the Twelfth Floor, Chen Jingwen of the Guangdong Grand Theater (represented by Ji Songpo), Wang [blank], and Cao Wangshi and Zhu Jiaxin, the plaintiffs, the case is currently under investigation. Once the investigation is complete, he will be sent to the bureau for severe punishment. It is said that the swindler speaks various dialects very fluently.</p>

<h3 id="e142">American Protestant Episcopal Church to Build Large-Scale Hospital in Shanghai <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Budget Set at US$500,000; St. Luke's and St. Elizabeth's Hospitals to Merge</p>
<p>The American Protestant Episcopal Church has two hospitals in Shanghai, St. Luke's and St. Elizabeth's. The church has raised US$500,000 to build another large-scale hospital in Shanghai, planning to merge St. Luke's and St. Elizabeth's. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Budget of US$500,000: According to Bishop Guo of St. John's University of the Episcopal Church, the Council of the American Episcopal Church believes that hygiene facilities in China are still very rudimentary, and has decided to build a large-scale hospital in Shanghai, with a budget of US$500,000, which has been fully raised. It also plans to establish a nursing school within the hospital to cultivate nursing talent. After the American archbishop comes to Shanghai, bidding will be opened for construction.</p>
<p>New Hospital to Be Eight Stories: The hospital to be built by the Episcopal Church this time will be eight stories high. The site has been determined at the corner of Hardoon Road and Changping Road. The hospital will have 270 beds, and the eighth floor is reserved for an obstetrics hospital. In addition to the medical equipment provided by St. Luke's and St. Elizabeth's hospitals, new equipment will be purchased. St. Luke's Hospital has approximately one million yuan remaining from previous years, which can be used for equipment expenses. Therefore, after the hospital is established, it will be very large in scale.</p>
<p>St. Elizabeth's and St. Luke's to Merge: St. Elizabeth's and St. Luke's hospitals in Shanghai were established in 1880, and have a long history of 55 years. After the new hospital is completed, it is planned to merge the two hospitals into the new hospital. The original St. Luke's hospital will be used as an emergency room and ambulance station, and St. Elizabeth's Hospital on Avenue Road will be converted into an obstetrics hospital. Some medical equipment is prepared to be transferred to the new hospital for use. This plan has been confirmed by the American headquarters.</p>

<p>A Page of 25 Years of British History</p>
<p>To commemorate the 25th anniversary of the accession of King George V of England, grand celebrations are being held everywhere. The Cathay Theater on the south bank of the Second Bridge will show "A 25-Year History of England" at 9:15 PM on the 8th to express its congratulations. This film is a joint production of all the British film companies, specially produced to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the British monarch's accession. All staff members were mobilized, with 200 main actors and 5 directors, setting an unprecedented record in British film history. The entire plot takes the British monarch as the warp and the events of the past 25 years in England as the weft, touching on local customs and the increasing changes, which is extremely interesting. By watching this film, the changes and evolution of England in the past 25 years are vividly displayed, making it a page of modern history, the value of which is extremely precious. All major events occurring from 1910 to 1935 are outlined in detail and vividly narrated. On the day the film was completed, the company immediately printed copies and shipped them to British locations around the world. For long distances, they were shipped by plane. The copies for Shanghai and Hong Kong were delivered by plane, first arriving in Singapore and then being transferred from Singapore to Shanghai. The shipping cost for this leg alone was 60 British pounds, showing the extent of their willingness to sacrifice. It is expected that there will be a grand occasion on the day the film is shown.</p>

<p>Tang Fuhai, Tian Qiyu, and others from Jiangbei are devout believers in gods and Buddhas. In December of last year, they raised funds and built three bungalows in the North Tanjia Ferry area of West Shanghai, where they sculpted three golden statues of Guanyin Buddha and named the place Cihang Pudu Ten Buddha Hall. Tang and others burned incense and worshipped, chanting sutras day and night. In January of this year, Xue Hui and Wang Dexing falsely claimed to Tang and others that they were living Buddhas who had descended to earth, able to enlighten the masses and possessed various secret incantations to cure diseases with miraculous results. They said that if they could cooperate, they would surely become prosperous in the future. Tang and others believed them to be true and invited Xue and Wang to cooperate. Xue then went out to promote their cause. Before long, a general crowd of ignorant men and women arrived at the hall to burn incense and seek treatment for their illnesses. Whenever someone sought treatment and kowtowed, Xue would chant incantations silently and then give them ash water, claiming that it was immortal water and charging a few dollars. Unexpectedly, over time, more and more people sought help, and the place became very crowded. Xue and Wang, seeing that the villagers were gullible, boldly extorted money. A Yu woman, seeking treatment for her illness, was swindled out of $1,000 by Xue. Xue then took the money and claimed it for himself. Seeing that Tang and others were weak and easily bullied, he took over the place. Tang and others became extremely resentful and filed a complaint with the Caodu Public Security Sub-Bureau the other day. Yesterday, Director Wang sent police officer Liu Pei, accompanied by police chief Hu Fuzhong, to investigate the hall and found the claims to be true. They arrested Tang, Tian, Xue, and Wang for setting up a temple without authorization and defrauding people of money, and confiscated the Buddha statues and paper cylinders. After the bureau staff questioned them separately, they decided that the case was related to setting up a temple and defrauding people of money, and ordered them to be sent to the General Bureau for further investigation.</p>

Thirty-six red pills were found on Lan, and one "shuanghao" coin and over two hundred copper coins were seized from Ding. They were taken to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, they were escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District. The lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, Zhi Shan, described the incident and presented the evidence for inspection. When questioned, the defendants claimed the red pills belonged to a fugitive petty criminal. The rest of their statements were evasive.

<h3 id="e156">Jisheng Society Reports on Liyang Disaster, Requests Increased Relief Funds <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society, along with other charitable organizations such as the Sino-Foreign Relief Committee, jointly organized spring relief efforts in Liyang. Director Li Yunmen was publicly dispatched, accompanied by relief workers, to investigate and decided to take responsibility for the first, second, third, and sixth districts of the county, conducting investigations separately. According to the director's report, Liyang has suffered from years of famine, war disasters, banditry, and financial losses. Last year, it suffered another severe drought. Over one million mu of paddy fields throughout the county suffered complete crop failure. The county is divided into six districts. Except for the fourth and fifth districts, which are being handled by the Wuxi Red Swastika Society, the first, second, third, and sixth districts have been inspected by the Sino-Foreign Relief Committee and the Jisheng Society. The sixth district is the most severely affected, being high in altitude and mountainous. The first, second, and third districts are slightly less severe. The suffering people are on the verge of death. They have pawned or sold everything. They are temporarily sustaining their lives on "Guanyin flour," bran, tree bark, and grass roots. It is said that "Guanyin flour" is actually fossilized stone, which causes severe intestinal pain after consumption, leading to countless deaths. Furthermore, those who fled to other places last winter to seek food are now returning due to the relief efforts, bringing their elderly and children, one after another. Dogs are nowhere to be seen in the villages they pass through, no chickens are heard, and no smoke rises from the chimneys. The situation is extremely dire. A sudden frost and snow fell last month, severely damaging the mulberry gardens and wheat crops. Natural disasters and human calamities are difficult to reverse. The society is responsible for the first, second, third, and sixth districts, which have more than 70,000 affected households, with a population of over 200,000 people, crying out for food and unable to survive without relief. It is estimated that there are over 50,000 households. According to the original relief funds, the resources are too meager to effectively distribute among so many people. Each incense officer constantly sends letters requesting an increase in relief tickets, which requires an increase in relief funds. Even after reducing the amount for the less severely affected, adhering to the principle of saving lives rather than alleviating poverty, many are disappointed. The overall plea is for increased funds to save these surviving people. The director witnessed the suffering firsthand and requested that the Sino-Foreign Relief Committee and other charitable organizations be implored to generously provide compassion during this most difficult time between harvests, jointly increase their efforts, and add even one more yuan, as it could save a life and create immeasurable blessings. In the past, the disasters in Shaanxi and Henan were the most severe. Now, the natural disasters have shifted to the Jiangsu and Zhejiang regions. Saving lives is an urgent matter, and those who want to live cannot. It is hoped that all the great philanthropists at home and abroad will be inspired to save lives at this critical juncture, and the merit will be ten times greater than usual.</p>

<p>The Red Swastika Society achieved considerable success in organizing relief efforts in Jiangsu and Jiangxi provinces last year. It is reported that the society is now raising over 100,000 yuan in relief funds to continue spring relief efforts. A summary of the society's relief efforts in various regions is detailed below.</p>
<p>Relief Efforts in Jiangsu Province: The disaster area in Jiangsu Province that is the most affected is Liyang. The Red Swastika Society is responsible for the fourth and fifth districts, allocating 40,000 yuan. Tang Huiqing and others from the Wuxi Red Swastika Society purchased 140,000 pieces of bean cakes, each weighing nine catties and four ounces, for distribution. They also allocated 4,000 yuan. Hua Jingxiu from the Wuxi Red Swastika Society personally went to the county to discuss purchasing two types of seeds, sheep willow and broadleaf, to be distributed by the Drought Relief Association. The disaster situation in Wuxi is also severe. Chairman Cai Quchen of the Wuxi branch is working with local authorities to raise 10,000 shi of foreign rice. The Ministry of Finance has approved and issued a duty-free passport for this purpose. Additionally, 1,000 yuan each was provided to Yizheng and Liuhe counties for spring relief.</p>
<p>Relief Efforts in Jiangxi Province: Zhao Yulin, the captain of the Second Relief Team of the Red Swastika Society, reported that 400 shi of rice has been allocated to the disaster area of Nanfeng, and distribution in the seventh district has been completed. The fifth and sixth districts are currently under investigation. The disaster situation in Nancheng is relatively mild, and distribution in the second and sixth districts has been scheduled. The disaster situation in Lichuan is extremely severe, with starving people everywhere. The county has six districts. According to the "strict and lenient distribution" method, 800 shi of relief rice was allocated, which should be enough to provide universal relief. The districts are currently being investigated. In areas with rugged roads and inconvenient transportation, rice has been purchased nearby for distribution. In addition, Poyang suffered from hail damage, destroying the wheat crops. The disaster victims are in dire need of relief. The Red Swastika Society has allocated 300 shi of emergency relief rice. Another 300 shi of emergency relief rice has been allocated to Donggu Town in Ji'an. As for the relief efforts in Gao'an, they have already begun, with the two team leaders, Hong Chenglin and Hu Zhongcheng, working with local communities to manage the process.</p>
<h3 id="e158">Selling Dried Tobacco: Zhang Jiangshan Drowns in the River <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Jiangshan from Zhenjiang, age thirty-six, recently opened a Dadesheng dried tobacco shop at number 266 Linping Road, Xiangyan Bridge, Hongkou, specializing in wholesale business. The day before yesterday in the early morning, Zhang Jiangshan and the shop clerk Yan Guozhen, each carrying two shoulder poles, transported 2,200 packages of dried tobacco by ferry from Dongjiadu to Tangqiao Town in Pudong. They sold dried tobacco to various grocery stores, sometimes dozens of packages, sometimes one or two hundred packages. They gradually moved to Yangjiadu Town, having sold a total of 750 packages. At about 11:30 AM, Zhang Jiangshan, with the remaining goods, intended to sell them in the Nanshi area. Thus, he and the shop clerk Yan Guozhen boarded the Yangjiadu ferry (which uses a small boat for towing). Because it was noon, there were fewer passengers, so there were five empty ferries docked at the pier. Passengers had to cross over these empty boats to board. The empty boat on the outside would then take passengers in turn. Zhang Jiangshan was the first to step onto Gu Hongsheng's ferry. Subsequently, Yan Guozhen, carrying the tobacco basket on his shoulder, followed him onto the boat. He lost his footing and fell into the river. Zhang Jiangshan, in an attempt to help Yan Guozhen, also fell into the water. Gu Hongsheng, the owner of the ferry, saw the accident and quickly called his companions to rescue them. They managed to rescue Yan Guozhen, saving him from drowning. However, Zhang Jiangshan did not resurface after falling into the river and apparently drowned. The body's whereabouts are unknown and efforts to locate it have been unsuccessful. The shoulder pole and over a thousand packages of dried tobacco had already scattered and drifted away. Afterwards, Gu Hongsheng, the owner of the ferry, and Yan Guozhen went to the water patrol station to report the incident and request the recovery of the body. According to Yan Guozhen, "When I stepped onto the ferry, I fell into the river. The shop owner Zhang Jiangshan helped me, causing him to fall into the river and drown." Yesterday afternoon, the detective summoned Zhang Jiangshan's wife, Zhang Jiangshi, and briefly questioned Yan Guozhen and Zhang Jiangshi, before handing them over to the local court for interrogation. Meanwhile, patrol boats were ordered to search for the body at the scene of the incident. The deceased was wearing a blue lined spring robe, a black lined spring jacket, black cloth shoes, and black lined trousers. As of yesterday evening, the body had not been recovered.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Woman Commits Suicide by Taking Three Bottles of Miltown <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Huang Canhui, age twenty-eight, from Guangdong, is the owner of the Meihua Art Advertising Agency at number 47 Wufu Lane, Nanjing Road. His wife, Ms. Lu, also age twenty-eight and also from Guangdong, named Yuqing, had been married for a long time but had not yet given birth. Recently, Huang's advertising agency failed, resulting in losses. According to Ms. Lu's intentions, Huang's depression led to a rash decision. On the afternoon of the 4th at 11 PM, she went alone to the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Muqiao Street in the French Concession and registered under her own name, Lu Yuqing, for room 107 on the second floor. After booking the room, she went to the bathroom to take a bath. After finishing, she returned to the room, put on makeup, powdered her face, put fresh flowers in her hair, dressed neatly, and swallowed three bottles of Miltown sleeping pills, committing suicide. After taking the pills, she closed the door, lay down on the bed, and waited for death. At approximately 6 AM the next morning, the poisoning caused her to moan, which was discovered by the tea attendant Shi Rumei (age forty, from Shaoxing). He entered the room and reported it to the French police, who immediately summoned an ambulance to take her to Renji Hospital.

<p>Chen Jinlan from Ningbo, a prisoner detained in the Second Special District Local Court Detention Center for murder, was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment after being upheld by the Supreme Court in the third trial. When the Third Branch Court received the verdict and was about to send her to prison, she escaped from prison on the morning of December 27th of the previous year at approximately 1 AM, taking advantage of the guards' negligence and using a wire to open the inner and outer prison doors. The Procuratorate of the High Third Branch Court issued an arrest warrant. On the afternoon of the 15th of last month at 4 PM, Bao Dongliang and Yang Zhongfang, detectives from the French Police Department, learned that after Chen escaped, she fled to Hankou. Unable to make a living, she returned to Shanghai and hid in the home of Bian Wuchang, a fellow villager on the front floor of a carpentry shop at number 32 Lao Yong'an Street. They immediately went to the address, arrested Chen, and arrested Wang Afu from Suzhou, who had lent money to Chen to help her hide. They were escorted to the Second Special District Court, where the prosecutor and the police department separately filed public prosecutions for the crimes of escape and harboring a criminal. The circumstances of the trial have been reported in this newspaper. After a final trial by Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special District Court, Judge Zhang went to the First Criminal Court yesterday morning at 10 AM and ordered Chen and Wang to be brought to the court. Chen Jinlan was sentenced to four years of imprisonment for damaging the implements of the detention facility and escaping, and Wang Afu was sentenced to two years of imprisonment for enabling an escapee to hide. The number of days of detention before sentencing will be offset by two days for each day of imprisonment. After the sentencing, Chen requested the court to return the five yuan in banknotes that were confiscated from her when she was arrested. The court stated that the money was lent to Chen by an informant who was paid by the detectives handling the case and denied her request. Chen cursed the court and was taken back to the detention center by the bailiff to await further action.</p>

<p>(3) Business in the Jiangbei Area: The Jiangbei area south of the river is a production area for cotton, grains, and miscellaneous crops, and commerce is traditionally prosperous. In order to promote business, the bank has successively established branches in Dongtai, Lincheng, Rufou, Huai'an, Gaoyou, Jiangyan, Shentong, Shiying, Taixing, Huangqiao, and other places to actively conduct business, which has been quite fruitful.</p>
<p>(4) Adding Warehouses: In order to provide credit based on goods, it is necessary to establish warehouses. The bank already has warehouses in places such as Shanghai, Nanjing, Qingdao, Xuzhou, Bengbu, Changshu, Ningbo, and other places, which are already of considerable scale. However, those already established still need to be expanded, and those not yet established urgently need to be added. In this fiscal year, efforts have been made in this regard, and preparations have been made in various commodity distribution centers, either by purchasing land for self-construction, renting houses for trial operation, cooperating with other banks, or operating independently by the bank, all depending on the local situation, with a degree of flexibility. It is estimated that within one year, the number of newly added and expanded warehouses has reached seventy-seven, including eighteen warehouses, thirty-eight sub-warehouses, and twenty-one specially contracted warehouses. The main items stored are cotton yarn, rice, wheat, silk, ramie, peanuts, miscellaneous grains, flour, hides, and furs. The distribution locations of each warehouse are listed as follows:</p>
<p>Location | Warehouse | Sub-warehouse | Special Contract Warehouse | Cooperation</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Hankou | 3 | 3 | |</p>

<p>In addition, warehouse foundations have also been secured in Danyang, Wuhu, Bengbu, Nantong, Weinan, and other places, and construction has begun, so they can also be established soon.</p>
<p>(5) Emphasis on Agricultural Investment: The bank has always attached great importance to agricultural investment. Items such as cotton, silk, rice, and wheat are all necessities for the livelihood of the common people and are especially the investment targets of the bank. This year, Jiangbei, Hebei, and Northwest agricultural production have generally reported bumper harvests, and the increase in the bank's inland branches and warehouses has also made the provision of funds more convenient. Therefore, the amount of investment has increased quite rapidly. As of the end of the year, the investment in various agricultural products is as follows (unit: yuan):</p>
<p>Category | Investment | Total Amount | Percentage</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>Cotton | 14,107,035 | 57.13</p>
<p>Rice | 3,602,940 | 14.59</p>

<h3 id="e177">Jiangda Volleyball Finals: Fudan Retains Championship, Score 3-0, Jinan Loses Again <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>This year's Jiangda Volleyball Tournament, which began on April 30th, included Jinling and Central from Nanjing, and Guanghua, Chizhi, Fudan, and Jinan from Shanghai, a total of six schools. However, Jinling and Central both withdrew voluntarily due to unforeseen circumstances, so only the four Shanghai schools competed. After several days of competition, Fudan and Jinan won the right to compete in the finals. The two teams played the finals yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the Chizhi Stadium. It is understood that Fudan is the volleyball champion of Jiangda, and its strength is very strong. Jinan also made every effort to attack, and although Xu Heng rushed back from Hangzhou to join the team, the whole team lacked coordination, and he had little support. As a result, Fudan relied on the spiking of Qiu, Chen, Zhou, and others to defeat Jinan 3-0 and retain the championship.</p>
<p>First Set</p>
<p>At the start of the match, Jinan's momentum was very strong. Xu Heng's blocking and spiking won three points in a row. Fudan's Qiu Guangxie, Zhou Dayun, and Chen Zongqi coordinated their attacks, spiking left and right, and in an instant, they won the switch with a score of 11-5. After switching sides, Fudan continued to improve and scored six points in one go. Jinan only scored one point, making the score 17-6. Jinan calmly responded and once revived its momentum, chasing the score to 17-10. However, Fudan's momentum did not wane, and Qiu and Chen made contributions with every move. Fudan then won the first set 21-10.</p>
<p>Second Set</p>
<p>Fudan became even more fierce, and Jinan was unwilling to give in. Fudan consistently led by two points. From then on, Fudan's momentum was overwhelming, and everything they sought was achieved easily. After 15-6, Jinan's Xu Heng, with the assistance of Wang Nanzhen, made the score 15-8. After that, Jinan made few gains, and Fudan's Qiu Guangxie's spiking was like the collapse of heaven and earth, which Jinan could not resist. They eventually lost again with a score of 11-21.</p>
<p>Third Set</p>
<p>After losing two sets in a row, Jinan's main player Xu Heng gathered the players and secretly gave instructions under the net. Sure enough, the team's morale was greatly boosted, and Xu Heng's setting and spiking gave them a three-point lead. Fudan's Qiu, Zhou, and Chen then showed their best skills, with arm spikes and blocks, achieving success naturally. After switching sides at 11-9, Jinan still thought of winning with surprise moves, and Xu Heng relied on his courage to pull back three points, but it was a drop in the bucket and ultimately failed to save the situation. They eventually lost 19-21.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Opening of the Junior Baseball League: John's Overwhelming Victory Over American School, 12-3, Today Hujiang vs. Jiaotong <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Junior Baseball League, initiated by the Huadong Company, with the participation of John's, American School, Hujiang, and Jiaotong Universities, began yesterday afternoon. John's played against American School at the American School field on Beidang Road. As a result, John's won overwhelmingly by 12-3. Hujiang vs. Jiaotong will be held today at 4:00 PM at Jiaotong University in Xujiahui.</p>
<p>The situation was completely one-sided. John's was superior to American School in all aspects. John's pitcher, Gan Zhen, had decent technique, and although there were often four balls, American School players were often struck out and had to leave the field. The American School's pitcher was weak and unable to do much, reportedly due to a hand injury. John's had as many as four home runs. John's batted first and scored one point each in the second and third innings. In the fourth inning, a long ball flew into the flowers and trees, and three people ran in a row. This inning totaled as many as five points. After John's scored eight points, American School also got a home run in the sixth inning, only to add two more points. As a result, John's won overwhelmingly by 12-3. Because of the weakness of the American side, the match was not very tense. The scores of each inning are as follows:</p>
<p>John's 0 1 1 5 2 1 2 Total 12 points</p>
<p>(1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7)</p>
<p>American School 0 0 1 0 2 0 Total 3 points</p>
<p>John's: Pitcher Gan Zhen, Catcher He Ruihua, 1st Base Huang Guanchang, 2nd Base Fang Guanxian, 3rd Base Zeng Rui, Shortstop Wu Zhenbang, Center Fielder Zeng Ruikang, Right Fielder Huang Yuanfa, Left Fielder Fang Guanming,</p>
<p>American School: Pitcher Davis, Catcher Meng Sheng, 1st Base Xu Mizi, 2nd Base Heng Siboqin, 3rd Base Antesheng, Shortstop Tai Shi, Right Fielder Shi Duoge, Center Fielder Bei Er, Left Fielder Boliedeng,</p>

<p>The Third Joint Cup Championship, organized by the Shanghai Chinese Table Tennis Federation, has been divided into senior and junior divisions starting this year to increase interest in the Shanghai table tennis scene. A total of 30 teams registered to participate. The six strong teams of Post Office Workers, Guangdong, Zu Ci, American Body, Langya, and Jingwu were selected for the senior division, and the rest were in the junior division. While the junior division is still competing, the senior division teams are strong, but the talent of each team varies somewhat. As a result, every match is extremely tense. The Post Office Workers Team A, relying on the remaining excitement of winning the Australian-Shanghai Yili Cup, won all five matches the day before yesterday, dominating Shanghai and winning this year's senior division championship, retaining the cup for one session. The previous champions were: First Session, Post Office Workers A; Second Session, Guangdong; This Session, Post Office Workers A.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Open Doubles Handball Tournament champions from last year, Zhu Lian, Hong Yu-kui, unfortunately failed this year and were relegated to runner-up. The other Chinese participants included the team of Sun Dao-sheng and Sun Su-lu, who performed well. However, these two teams had not played against each other, so a supplementary match was held yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM. Sun Jia-lu was temporarily absent and was replaced by the strong player Hua Feng-shan. The official competition was considered a forfeit, and a performance match was arranged. This was the first time that the four heroes of Chinese handball had performed in Xiqing, so it attracted the attention of many Chinese and Western spectators. The intensity of the match, the closeness of the scores, and the tension of the situation were rarely seen. It took three games to determine the winner, with a difference of only two or three points. Each performance reached perfection. Zhu Hong won the first game 24 to 22. Sun Hua then won the second game 21 to 17. Zhu Hong then won the third game 21 to 19. As a result, Zhu Hong won two to one.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Ministry Order: Xiamen University to Improve <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 6th Dispatch) The Ministry of Education instructed the private Xiamen University, stating in brief: According to the report from the Ministry's inspector, the teachers of the school are mostly full-time and dedicated to their work. Most of the students are able to be simple and studious, and abide by school rules. The reference books in each department and the scientific equipment of the College of Science are all of a considerable scale. The plant and animal specimens and research journals of the Department of Biology are quite rich. The department's emphasis on the study of local products is appropriate, and the discovery of *變形* [a technical term] is also of academic value. These achievements are commendable. However, the following points still need attention and improvement: 1. In recent years, the school's funding has been insufficient, and the allocation of expenditures, combined with the current state of school affairs, has failed to make sufficient progress. In the future, the board of directors should find ways to sort things out and raise a substantial fund to solidify the economic foundation. At the same time, the school should economize on administrative and miscellaneous expenses, and appropriately reduce the funding for the affiliated middle school, and increase the equipment expenses as much as possible to enrich the content and facilitate teaching. 2. The school's established curriculum is often changed during the course of studies, which has an impact. In the future, a detailed curriculum outline should be drawn up and implemented in earnest. 3. Attention should be paid to local teaching materials, such as the climate and customs of South China, the history, geography, dialects, business conditions, and international trade of Southeast Asia. 4. In the courses of the College of Liberal Arts and the College of Law and Commerce, which are biased towards lecturing, efforts should be made to guide students to conduct independent research. 5. Military training should be implemented in earnest. 6. The school's guidance facilities lack an active plan, the dormitory order is seldom clean and tidy, and there is no unified organization to handle student leave and absenteeism. It is necessary to establish responsible personnel to actively supervise and train them. 7. The staffing of the people in charge of the Finance Department and the Affairs Department is redundant and should be reduced. The Director of Group Education and the Group Education Staff should be changed to the Director of Student Affairs and the Student Affairs Staff respectively, in order to comply with the law. 8. The library has a small capacity and the layout is not entirely appropriate, and each department cannot make full use of it. Attention should be paid to improvement and promotion of practical efficiency. The school is hereby ordered to comply and report back.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 6th Dispatch) The Ministry of Education ordered the departments and bureaus to handle six cases. According to the report from the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education, the private Shanghai Physical Education Normal School requested an explanation of the exam subjects, class types, and gymnastic movements for the entrance examination. The Ministry instructed: "The matter has been reported. The various movements of the political class in the examination subjects can be understood by referring to the detailed syllabus of physical education professors compiled by the Ministry. The term *變目動作、（經中側掛腿雖楦撐）* [ gymnastic movement, (although leg supports through the middle side of the last)] under the equipment section is relatively obscure. It is now changed to *腿離楦經中側撐、並附該節全部動作腿式圖三幅* [Legs leave the last, passing through the middle and supporting from the side, and three pictures of all the movements of that section are attached]. Please inform them to take note of this and so on."

<p>— (Yan Mao-de)</p>
<p>If a person can do things without missing a single minute or second, then he will definitely gain a great advantage in his career. Napoleon himself once said that the reason he was able to defeat the Austrian army was that the Austrian soldiers did not understand the value of "five minutes." Every minute they missed was giving "misfortune" one more opportunity to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Nelson had a saying that can also serve as a model for young people in doing things. "The success of my life's work is that I always start one quarter of an hour early in everything I do."</p>
<p>The size of success will never exceed the size of your self-confidence. Napoleon's army would never have climbed over the Alps if Napoleon himself had thought it was too difficult. Similarly, in your life, if you have great doubts and distrust about your own abilities, then you will never be able to accomplish great things.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Night Fourth-Class Special Feature <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Shazhou</p>
<p>In these times, money is too tight, and everything that costs money has to be carefully calculated. Take this trip home from Shanghai, for example. I knew that there were several trains leaving Shanghai for the north every day, but the express train was too expensive, and the slow train was not economical in terms of time. Although I didn't have any urgent business that required me to rush back overnight, once a traveler is on the way home, no one doesn't hope to get home a moment sooner. After a lot of calculation, I finally decided to take the night fourth-class train at 0:50 AM, because the night fourth-class train is not slower than the express train, but the price is much cheaper. When I decided to take the night fourth-class train, I thought I was a shrewd person, but who knew that when I entered the platform and walked to the door of each car, there were people stopping me from boarding, saying, "There's no room for even one more person. Please go to another car to see." When I heard this, I didn't quite believe it, and looked straight into the car. Only when I saw that the car was indeed crowded with people did I suddenly realize that there were many more than just me who were so-called shrewd people. But no matter how crowded it was, not getting on the train was not an option. After turning around twice, I had to say many good things to the temporary guards at the car door before they allowed me to get on. When I got on the train and looked around, oh my God, not only was the car full of people, but the inside and outside of the toilets and both sides of the aisles were also full of people. What should I do? Move forward? Retreat? There was nowhere to go.</p>
<p>"Traveling is never comfortable. Let's just stand for a few hours." That's what I thought in my heart. At the same time, I saw that the people on this train were all as disheveled as I was. It seemed that they were all forced out by the economic downturn. Well, let the economic downturn drive us back to the poor and helpless countryside. We are all in the same boat!</p>
<h3 id="e197">Ah Chang <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>Ah Chang was a laborer hired to oversee work at our home in the past. He was from Jiangbei, brought back by my grandmother's maternal uncle, Fu Xiang, when he went to Changxing to clear land. Ah Chang didn't have a surname; his original name was "Da Changzi." We thought it sounded too unpleasant, so we changed his name.</p>
<p>He stayed with our family for a good five or six years, helping us with work in the fields and on the mountains. His wages were, of course, very meager—explicitly three dollars a month. This person wasn't really necessary for our family; we could use him, but we could also do without him. So, keeping him was really out of pity for his homelessness and vagrancy.</p>
<p>He was quite young and didn't look too repulsive, and he had a good physique, but he was somewhat lazy. He ate an alarming amount, always four large bowls each meal. Two *sheng* of white rice wasn't enough to fill him for a day; he could eat plain rice without any dishes.</p>
<p>My sister and I didn't like him because he spoke in a pure Jiangbei dialect, which was really extremely unpleasant to hear. Our young aunt was a woman who was good at teasing and playing pranks, so she often tried to imitate him with a curled tongue, saying, "La kuai, zhe kuai, aiyo kuai!"</p>
<p>"Ah Chang, you are so stupid: you've been here for five or six years, and you still can't get rid of your Jiangbei accent." My mother sometimes said to him when he couldn't understand "La kuai? Zhe kuai?" She would say this angrily, but he would just grin, showing his teeth, and reply, "I can't learn this kuai stuff." And that was that.</p>
<p>After my father died, our family's financial situation deteriorated day by day. Therefore, we had to try our best to economize on daily expenses, and that extra person was also dismissed.</p>
<p>"Madam! I have nowhere to go, please save me!" When my mother settled his wages and was about to ask him to leave, he knelt on the ground, kowtowing and begging my mother. My mother was moved by compassion, so she finally kept him for another half a year. After half a year, my mother introduced him to a local gentleman's family as a sedan chair carrier.</p>
<p>Ah Chang's savings over the years had surprisingly reached more than three hundred dollars. The year before last, he asked my mother to help him marry a maid from a wealthy family in Huzhou. This year, when I returned to my hometown, his child was already babbling.</p>

<p>Chapter Ten: Ashamed of Having No Clothes, He Avoids Guests Behind Curtains; Diligently Saving Lamp Oil, He Copies Books at Dawn</p>
<p>Zhiqian said, "I don't know about that. But judging from how everyone is saving lamp oil, it's obvious that the students provide their own light. Think about it, they don't even prepare vegetables for their meals; would they be willing to spend more money to buy lamp oil? They don't buy oil, and the school doesn't buy oil either. As a result, everyone has to sit in the dark. Once it gets dark, the time is wasted, and they feel it's a pity. So they adapt to the circumstances and go to bed early and get up to work as soon as it gets light. Wang Beihai listened from the side without saying a word. Now that Zhiqian had finished speaking, he couldn't help but interrupt, smiling, 'Mr. Cheng says that the students in the interior are suffering. Of course, that's true for students in Xi'an and above. But eating hard cornbread and drinking millet soup without vegetables might not be suffering.' Zhiqian slapped his thigh and laughed, 'Ah! I forgot you were like that too. But students like you are only a part of the students in Xi'an, but the whole student body is the same in the school I am talking about. Furthermore, you probably didn't have the pain of not having light when you want to read through the night. So, I felt endless emotion after I visited that elementary school. People engaged in education should go to the grassroots instead of sitting in big cities, talking about education theory, and thinking about education plans. What's the use? It's like the elementary school I mentioned, there are too many problems. How can we stop them from copying books? How can we prevent them from sleeping when it gets dark and getting up to copy books when it gets light? This is the first step in implementing education. But I think the education administrators wouldn't dream that there is such a phenomenon in county-run elementary schools in county towns, right?' (198)"</p>
<h3 id="e200">Records of the Fragrant Imperial Aroma <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Dear readers, imagine how trivial everything we have discussed above is. Inside the Summer Palace, just like a beehive, so many special industrial workshops were clustered together, and they were all similarly trivial and busy. Every artisan was constantly working hard, but the original driving force behind their hard work was simply the Empress Dowager's occasional happiness: Her old self only had to think of an idea, and that would be enough to keep these artisans busy! Although they, like all of them, received preferential treatment far beyond what ordinary workers could dream of, they could not have any say in their work, so it would not be wrong to call them a group of male and female prisoners.</p>
<p>However, in fact, most of the male and female artisans looked like very comfortable and happy prisoners who voluntarily lived in this prison indefinitely.</p>
<p>After they worked so hard for a few years or decades, it was rare to happen by chance that one person's work was loved by the Empress Dowager, and she praised them in front of everyone: this person would be so happy that they would even forget their own birth date, and the rest of the people would be inspired by this and work even harder. But how could the Empress Dowager praise them casually? Who knows how long it would take for such a rare event to happen!</p>
<p>Every time the Empress Dowager talked to me about these industries in the palace, she always had a long speech, either planning how to add new products or planning how to train new artisans, and her words were always detailed and practical: therefore, I often secretly admired her, believing that if her old self were hired to manage a factory, she would definitely be a very capable leader. What was particularly surprising about her innate talent was her memory: she often remembered many very small things very clearly, even though the artisans who were directly involved had forgotten them; therefore, no matter what kind of craftsmanship it was, the position of supervisor had to be taken by the Empress Dowager herself.

<p>A Precious Ring</p>
<p>Mrs. Leiluo Di Kai Li of the United States recently received a precious ring from the Egyptian era. This ring was originally in the coffin of an Egyptian king. It was cast in gold and silver and has colors such as red, green, and blue. It has a gold mummy image and a lover's image. There is a lid on the outside. According to archaeologists' speculation, this ring is two thousand years old and is a priceless treasure.</p>

However, he was unyielding and refused to eat. He went on a hunger strike for seventy-one days, and died of starvation on the seventy-fifth day. The second was the Indian patriot Jatindra Nath Das, who also died in prison after a hunger strike of sixty-one days.

<p>Forcing the Old and Young to Smoke</p>
<p>In the area of the Danube River in eastern Serbia, fierce poisonous snakes are rampant, and there are reports of residents being harmed every day. Later, it was discovered that poisonous snake bites can be detoxified by spraying tobacco smoke. Therefore, the Serbian government issued a smoking order, requiring men, women, old and young, to smoke, and ordered teachers in elementary schools to guide them on how to smoke. Therefore, people in that area have cigarettes and cigars in their mouths, and smoke is everywhere, and people cannot be seen across the street. In particular, women regard smoking as the most fashionable, and compete to be novel.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Securities Exchange saw a very sluggish and quiet market. Although it followed a holiday on Monday, the environment showed little change. Because the settlement date was far off and there was plenty of time, everyone remained in a wait-and-see attitude. There were successive instances of bonds that no one inquired about, especially in the second session in the morning, where six or seven types were not traded at all. The market atmosphere was depressed, and morale was low. Only the 96 bonds were traded somewhat actively, although it was still less than before, but it still accounted for more than half of the total volume. Market prices were mostly declining, unable to break through the 9-yuan mark. It was bound to break 8.5 yuan, as predicted by the reporter. The trend and prospects were likely to continue to fluctuate. It was temporarily unlikely that the 96 bonds would rise rapidly. Yesterday's transactions were sparse and unremarkable. In the second session, the long-term 20 bonds No. 11 were sold and No. 34 were bought, with a trading volume of 110,000, which was rare. The rest mostly failed to trade. In the morning session, the 96 bonds accounted for 1.3 million, and the remaining various types totaled only 800,000 in trading volume. Trading was slightly more active in the afternoon, with market prices fluctuating and showing weakness. The closing session saw light trading.

<p>Golden Rooster Factory Short Swap</p>
<p>The opening price of standard yarn in the morning market was still flat this month. When shooting to June, the market atmosphere was very weak, and selling pressure rose sharply. The far months were affected, and each month fell by 0.6-0.7 jiao to 1 yuan. The market conditions in the market were quite soft, and everyone competed to sell short due to certain unfavorable news. This month broke through the 173 yuan mark, and then rose a few jiao after profit-takers covered their positions. As a result, each month fell by 0.2, 0.4, 0.6, and 0.7 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The opening price in the afternoon was still flat. When shooting to the 2nd and 3rd markets, it suddenly tightened because spot yarn transactions were smooth, demand in Nambu was still strong, and some manufacturers made swap transactions and supplemented the near months.

Therefore, the market is tight, and buying is strong. According to the survey, cotton merchants in Lu, Yu, Jin, and Ji are all in long positions and are holding on to large amounts of funds, it is said.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Hexing Covers Short Positions</p>
<p>The opening of standard cotton in the morning market followed the downturn in the yarn market. The market was in a state of panic, but US cotton rose slightly, and Indian cotton was also good by one rupee five. Standard gold and exchange rates were closed due to the British monarch's anniversary. Although there was fear among speculators, the large longs remained calm. The near-month market was very tight. The shooting to the 2nd and 3rd markets suddenly became sharp. Retail investors covered their short positions and remained firm. As a result, the near and far months rose by 0.5 jiao compared to the closing price of the previous day. The middle month did not move. The opening in the afternoon saw Hexing buy to cover short positions. There was also news that the climate in the north was too dry, which was not conducive to new cotton planting.

<p>(Bombay) Although American cotton prices fluctuated last week, futures remained firm. Most transactions involved the liquidation of long positions in February-May white Broach cotton. Old cotton prices remain high, due to the scarcity of deliverable goods. Therefore, the price difference between new and old cotton is widening. The recent rise in silver prices has led to expectations of increased Chinese purchasing power, but as silver prices softened, cotton prices fell sharply. In terms of spot goods, Japanese demand is recovering, and there has also been significant trading in Shanghai. Yarn mills are showing slight interest. The weekly statistics are appended below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>

<p>(Liverpool) Spot goods inquiries were very good last week, but trading was limited. In terms of futures, it failed to follow the tightness of the spot market, and trading was light. The market is awaiting the US government's decision on new cotton policy. The Egyptian cotton market is very quiet, with little business, and is also waiting for developments in US cotton.</p>

<h3 id="e211">US Cotton Faces Selling Pressure at 12 Cents - Market Showed a Reactionary Trend Last Week <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>A New York dispatch on the cotton market for the week reports that the cotton market showed a reactionary trend last week. Due to the scarcity of spot goods and firmness in other commodity prices, selling pressure emerged as cotton prices approached 12 cents. This was due to the decline in silver prices and the uncertainty surrounding the government's new cotton policy. At the same time, brokers, local dealers, and those in the Far East were selling, but the pressure was not significant. According to an official estimate, Pakistani cotton production is 63% higher than last year. Revised estimates for Indian cotton production have also increased, so there are concerns about competition from foreign cotton. Inquiries for spot exports are sluggish, and local users are unwilling to buy, due to factory production cuts, firm cotton prices, and weak spot sales.</p>

<p>The flour market opened strongly this morning, with consistent gains across all months. Overseas wheat was quoted, with Chicago down 0.30 and Canada down approximately 0.08. Initial pricing for overseas wheat was low, and market sentiment was calm. However, due to cloudy weather and the summer festival, as well as slight transactions in spot flour by northern merchants, subsequent prices improved. Although market sentiment was good, trading was light, as the new wheat harvest is approaching, and only those with urgent needs were active, otherwise both insiders and outsiders are adopting a wait-and-see approach. When the market opened in the afternoon, trading remained sluggish, but selling was scarce and buying was strong, leading to a price increase of about 0.01. Given these circumstances, the weather is the key factor in price fluctuations, making predictions difficult. As a result, the current month rose by 0.0225, June-July rose by 0.0225, August rose by 0.0175, September rose by 0.0225, and October rose by 0.01.</p>
<p>The wheat market opened largely steady this morning, with overseas wheat quoted down approximately 0.30 in Chicago and approximately 0.08 in Canada. Initial pricing was affected by cloudy weather and prospects of rain. With the new harvest approaching, rain would have a significant impact. Reports on wheat harvests varied across regions, with no definitive picture. With few sellers, the market gradually stabilized. In the afternoon, trading was relatively active, and sentiment remained positive. Due to cloudy weather and the rise in flour prices, prices also rose. As a result, July rose by 0.06, August rose by 0.05, and September rose by 0.07. The spot wheat market is supported by good mill demand and firm flour prices, and high-quality wheat prices have risen by 0.01-0.02. Shandong wheat is quoted at 4.00, second grade at 4.58, Henan wheat at 3.93, Jiangbei wheat at 3.87, Luohe wheat at 3.86, Zhumadian wheat at 3.84, and second grade at 3.88. Fufeng sold 4,000 packages.</p>

<p>Yesterday, more than 30 sources (over 6,000 shih of goods) arrived for this rice (South Shanghai). In the local market, sentiment was firm due to cloudy weather, the situation was tight, and the market appeared promising. Prices for Su-Tong japonica and Nangang early rice, etc., all increased by 0.20. However, late rice prices were mainly driven by bulk purchases by large-scale buyers in Susong. Although it tried to follow the rise, it felt like the end of a spent arrow. Only those dealing with the central market added a premium, and high-quality goods did not rise. Improvement in weather would be beneficial. Furthermore, scarcity and a good appearance are beyond expectations.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 21 or 22 sources arrived from various river locations. Sales of various goods continued in the market. As prices in production areas continued to rise, the market price of high-quality white japonica rice rose by several cents, and medium-quality goods closely followed, rising by nearly 0.10. Early rice rose by 0.10-0.20, and white yuan rice also closely followed, rising by several cents. Other varieties also showed a tightening trend.</p>
<p>The prospect for foreign rice continues to improve. However, yesterday, as rice merchants continued to purchase broken rice and lower-quality rice, sales to the Yangtze River and northern merchants slowed down. Local sales were also only slightly transactional. Only merchants from inland areas continued to actively purchase. As yesterday was the summer festival, some inland merchants did not arrive, and transactions decreased. As a result, the market turned from active to stable, and the upward trend slowed down. The total volume of various kinds of rice traded throughout the day was about 18,000 packages, with over 700 packages of Ke-Hsien rice. Prices were similar to those of the previous day.</p>
<h3 id="e215">Soybean Sales Sluggish, Weak Upward Momentum <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market was not much different from last Saturday. Factory demand was not strong, and sales were not active. However, traders in the local market were relatively relaxed on pricing. Given the lack of large-scale purchases, the upward momentum is likely to be weak. The total market volume included one truckload of Quanhe beans, priced at 3.78; one truckload of Yingzhou beans, priced at 3.65; one truckload of Haozhou beans, priced at 3.55-3.65; over 410 packages of Luohe beans, priced at 3.81; one truckload of Huangkou beans, priced at 3.68; one truckload of Xikou beans, priced at 3.56; over 1,000 packages of Hankou early beans, priced from 3.95 to 3.75; and 43 packages of Hankou late beans, priced at 3.62.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was relatively stable, with a slightly tight tone. The public association quoted 16.04 for Dutch granulated sugar 24, and foreign warehouse goods were quoted at 5.20, a 0.05 increase for transit goods. There were no transactions. Taikoo Sugar B mark was quoted at 17.02. Local factory cotton white Zhenyu No. 1 was quoted at 15.085, No. 2 at 15.075, No. 3 at 15.06, and No. 4 at 15.045, unchanged from the previous day. Local ice sugar No. 1 was quoted at 21.06, and No. 2 at 21.5. Chaoqing sugar remained firm and had not been traded, with few sales.</p>
<p>The Dutch steamship Djassar had imported from Surabaya, arriving with 502 packages of Dutch red sugar, 4,259 packages of refined granulated sugar, and 25 packages of raw granulated sugar. The Dutch steamship Djassar Deni also arrived with 502 packages of Dutch red sugar, 27,963 packages of coarse granulated sugar, totaling 33,476 packages.</p>

<p>The price of white tung oil in Hankou's foreign firms has risen again. After rising from 35-36 yuan to 39 yuan last week, the situation has become increasingly tight. As this week began, there were signs of a storm brewing. Last night, local firms received telegrams from Hankou stating that foreign firms had sold at 40.05 yuan for spot goods. As such, the market price is likely to break through 40 yuan. And the momentum is still strong, so another 1-2 yuan increase is possible. However, if it rises to 42-43 yuan, it can be considered as reaching its peak. Although it may not immediately fall back, it may stabilize. Due to the high prices for exports, foreign firms may find it difficult to make a profit. Once foreign firms stop purchasing, the market will weaken. Even if there is an attempt to maintain it, it cannot last long. As domestic sales are too light, the key to price fluctuations lies entirely in the strength of exports. Therefore, oil firms in Hankou have no confidence in the market and are simply following the market. Although there are some transactions with foreign firms in this city, the volume is very small. The production volume of Zhejiang tung oil is limited and cannot supply large quantities. The local market cannot stand independently from the Hankou market. Even if there are transactions, they cannot be considered standard.</p>

<h3 id="e220">Psychological Depiction in Works <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>Psychological depiction in works, in terms of its techniques, roughly has three styles. First, before and after writing a character, the author provides an explanatory-style description. Second, when depicting a character, the author narrates their actions and reflects their psychology along the way. Third, the author objectively portrays a character, making them stand before the reader naturally. The author does not focus on psychological depiction, but the character's psychology is clearly understood by the reader. It is not difficult to find examples to illustrate these three styles. However, in this short article, we can only touch on the topic and cannot quote large excerpts from current writers' works as evidence.</p>
<p>Generally, the first technique is not often seen in new writers' works. It is the laziest and oldest technique. The author of "The Laughing and Crying Marriage," in their daily life of writing five or six thousand words, specifically used this technique to lengthen the story. Therefore, this technique sometimes becomes a burden to the article.</p>
<p>The second technique is the most innovative. In this type of depiction, the entire piece shows only the character's movements, and the author's face is never revealed in the piece. Mr. Zhang Tianyi is very skilled and clever in using this technique. His "Bees," "Determinism," and "Fortune Telling" are the best examples.</p>
<p>Although the third technique has existed since ancient times, the author of "Hesitation" and "Call to Arms" can be considered as using it appropriately. Many of the typical characters in the two collections of novels, "Hesitation" and "Call to Arms," are vividly portrayed, each with its own characteristics. The author does not intend to depict psychology, but in practice, penetrates into the realm of psychological depiction. In this technique, the author does not adhere to explaining the character's psychology, but can create a contrast or reflection in the relationship between characters. There is a passage in "Dream of the Red Chamber" where Jia Rong borrows a glass pit screen from Wang Xifeng, which is a very good psychological depiction. After Jia Rong had already borrowed the screen, "Wang Xifeng thought of another matter. She called out to the window: 'Rong'er, come back!' Several people outside echoed: 'Master Rong, come back quickly'… He stood by with his hands hanging down, listening to her instructions. Wang Xifeng slowly drank her tea, and after a long time, she smiled and said: 'Alright, you can go now.'… This can be said to vividly depict Wang Xifeng's joy for Jia Rong.</p>
<p>However, these two psychological depiction techniques are determined by each writer's creative methods. Generally, the first type of author is mostly based on a philosophy of idealism, wanting to understand social psychology through the dissection of individual psychology in literature. The second type of author does not necessarily recognize the social relations of the characters in the work, but often simplifies the characters' social relations. As a result, the character's personality is expressed very actively, but obscures the foundation of the personality's development. Undoubtedly, the author starts from a realistic perspective and then goes down the psychological path. Only the third type of author has a correct social view. Although the characters in their book are used as examples, rather than focusing on individuality. Although "their value lies not in being different from other characters in the same situation, but in being the same, that is, in their commonality, not in their characteristics." But "examples" must also have "typicality," and "commonality" must also be clearly contrasted with another "commonality" to show their characteristics. Only in this way can the characters in the work be expressed more realistically and have more life.</p>
<h3 id="e221">Unexpected Events <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Wen</p>
<p>Because of the severe noise from mosquitoes and rats, I didn't fall asleep until the latter half of the night, and I still didn't wake up at dawn, and I started dreaming. Dreaming is common, but it's rare to have such a wonderful dream and feel so comforted. To suddenly have such a dream, something I hadn't thought of before, was also unexpected, because the person I was playing with in the dream was someone I had only recently met.</p>
<p>Dreaming is indeed common; dreaming well, sometimes even expecting it, isn't strange. Similarly, being startled awake from a dream is also common, and a good dream is naturally often interrupted. But this time, I suddenly had a very rare dream, and just as I was having fun playing, the sweet feeling was suddenly interrupted, shaken awake by an earthquake.</p>
<p>I live on one side of the Taiwan Strait, so for more than two months since spring, I have been frequently attacked by strong winds and heavy rains. This time, the earthquake in Taiwan, with its aftershocks, shook my bed and windows, which isn't really that strange. But how can it be such a coincidence: that I happened to be drifting here to live at this time, met such a person, had such a gathering in a dream, and was awakened in this way?</p>
<p>The bed and window lattice creaked three times in a row, and then again after more than twenty minutes; I couldn't sleep anymore, so I started thinking randomly, and the more I thought, the more inexplicable it seemed. When I think about it, in these past few years, many of the things encountered, both for the country and for individuals, have been unexpected.</p>
<p>I also remembered such an unexpected event; the spring before last, I went to Mount Emei to travel, walking from Jin Ding to Wanfo Ding, and on one side of Qianfo Ding, I saw a young man wandering on the road, in his twenties, wearing tattered clothes and short trousers. Not a monk, nor a pilgrim, and judging by his thin appearance, not a "porter" either. To encounter such a person on this high mountain was already unexpected. But he came up to me as soon as he saw me and asked:</p>
<p>"Sir! Can I be a monk here?"</p>
<p>This was even more unexpected, and I really couldn't deal with it for a moment. But things became even more unexpected, and before I could answer, his face tightened, and he began to cry softly; tears dripped down, falling one after another onto the sandy soil in front of his feet. I asked why, but he couldn't even speak.</p>
<p>Upon closer examination, this cannot be considered so strange. At that time in Sichuan, people were often being killed with machetes in the streets, and those being killed were deserters; these "soldiers" were "recruited," so they often tried to escape. Also, because of the heavy taxes, some people were forced to abandon their property and leave their hometowns. Although it cannot be said for sure that this young man was a fugitive, it can be asserted that he was forced up Mount Emei by the hardships of life. There are indeed many, many people living poorly, so it is not really strange. But at the time, I always felt it was unexpected.</p>
<h3 id="e222">Waiting Room <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Cheng</p>
<p>The waiting room of the women and children's hospital is filled with the cries of children.</p>
<p>Mothers sit on long benches. Older children walk around. Babies are gurgling and learning to talk, sometimes unknowingly urinating in their mothers' arms, leaving a wet pattern on the qipao that the mothers only wear when going out.</p>
<p>A woman in ragged clothes walked in. Her whole body covered in snow, her eyelids tiredly staring, flickering with red veins; she held a dried-up infant close, the child's head covered in small, uneven sores, two streams of snot hanging down from the corners of its mouth. It gnawed haphazardly on a cornbread bun.</p>
<p>Her surprised gaze constantly darted around this unfamiliar place, she wanted to sit on a bench with the other mothers, but she didn't dare; she could only huddle alone in the corner against the wall, squatting down on the floor.</p>
<p>A nurse in white walked up to her, first covering her nose, then saying harshly:</p>
<p>"Isn't that place not for sitting? Humph, what are you doing squatting like that?" Pointing to the bench, "Sir—oh, Miss." Her widened, lifeless eyes filled with gratitude, yet also with a bitter smile.</p>
<p>People had already started snickering. As soon as she sat on the bench, the ladies nearby covered their noses and walked away, deliberately spitting.</p>
<p>By half-past eleven, only a few scattered people remained in the room, and she was finally noticed, then called in. A doctor, as thin as a consumptive child, slowly spoke after examining the child:</p>
<p>"Don't give the child cornbread buns indiscriminately, wash the sores on the head with medicinal water every day, and for a fever, it's best to drink some milk, um, milk... Now, get the medicine." And he gave her a slip of paper.</p>
<p>"Three times a day, two dollars." The pharmacist handed over the blue-red medicinal water.</p>
<p>At first, she listened blankly, but the last sentence seemed to sting her, and she blurted out:</p>
<p>"How much? Miss."</p>
<p>"Two dollars. " The person spoke with a nasal tone. "I don't have that much money, I scraped together the three dimes for the registration fee over several days. Please, have some compassion, give me back my three dimes, I don't want the medicine."</p>
<p>"That's not my problem, you have to ask at the registration desk." She lowered her head, looked at her watch, it was exactly twelve o'clock, and slammed the dispensing window shut.</p>
<p>She went out the door, feeling very suffocated, the child wasn't cured; and she lost three dimes for nothing. She regretted coming to this foreign hospital, she couldn't stand the foreignness of it all.</p>
<p>Outside, the snow was still falling, she walked step by step down the white street. A thought crossed her mind: she should find a general practitioner instead. Thinking this, her pace quickened.</p>
<h3 id="e223">Mourning Lost Friendship <a href="#e223" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c223" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">223</a></h3>
<p>— Chi Xia</p>
<p>There was a time when I lost a friend's heart. I had taken warmth from it, received sympathy, and easily lost it over a small matter. At the time, I didn't feel sad, but the desolation of time brought back memories of the past, gradually making me feel regret, a nameless emptiness, mixed with boundless sorrow, suddenly floating up from the bottom of my heart.</p>
<p>It's been two years since I've seen this friend. In these two years, I've been living in a crowd, like traveling in a desert. From afar, a heart left me and went away, and I seemed to have no power to pull it back. My soul slowly became withered. I abandoned all friends, cutting them off by isolation. All friends also abandoned me, scorning me with contempt. I only felt lonely. How precious is a friend's heart! If a woman is considered a pearl of solace in life, then a true friend can be compared to a steadfast diamond. Unfortunately, this steadfast diamond slipped through my fingers. For two years, I've felt like I've lost my center of gravity, my soul constantly floating in a haze.</p>
<p>Those who have read Anatole France's "Lettre de mon ami" can understand the preciousness of friendship. "On the journey of life, a friend is your only comforter," "A woman can only moisten your soul, but cannot fill it. A friend gives you the greatest assistance in the latter's demands." In those days, I didn't understand the true meaning of these words. Now, I understand the profound meaning. True friendship can make your life move upward. In times of difficulty, it gives you assistance without seeking reward. In times of disappointment, it drips out its own life force to encourage you to move forward again. Unexpectedly, you will receive letters from him from afar. Every sentence on the long paper can be read as being very concerned. Whether under flowers or before a lamp, his shadow flickers around you, thus causing a feeling of comfort, making you feel that everything around you is very lovely, and that the future is filled with great hope. Even when you fail in your career, you can muster the strength that hasn't died to reclaim everything that has been lost.</p>
<p>When such an emotional force leaves my side, as the days go by, one naturally feels an unspeakable emptiness. The hearts of two people become more and more distant, even more isolated than strangers. I thought about pulling him back, but in the end, I didn't have the strength to do it. The days passed in hesitation, and the friendship of the past flowed away like passing water and never returned.</p>
<p>The past, like smoke, is woven into my heart at this moment. Things change too quickly. Two years ago today, I never dreamed that I would lose the heart of this friend!</p>
<h3 id="e224">A Corner of a Carriage <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>— TK</p>
<h3 id="e225">Three Days (4) <a href="#e225" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c225" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">225</a></h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>Just like himself, his father died when he was twenty-three. At that time, his younger brother, Youcai, was still young and couldn't do much. He worked hard alone for seven or eight years, paying off the debts left by his father and arranging Youcai's marriage. Although he didn't clear all the old debts, he managed to patch things up year after year, so at least new debts didn't accumulate. However, life was indeed getting harder and harder. Even going to town to buy something was getting more expensive every year. According to Hu Yongliang and the others, it was the rich people causing trouble in the middle. He really didn't understand how they came up with these ideas. What did these things have to do with rich people? The year there was a famine, not a single grain of rice could be harvested from the fields. Even though he reported the famine to the granary and didn't have to repay the rent rice, he still needed rice to eat and capital for next year's farming. Fortunately, Master Lu discussed it with several yamen runners in the county and set up this loan society. Everyone could borrow from it, with only a small amount of interest. When borrowing, one-tenth of the principal was deducted first. For example, if you borrowed one hundred, ten yuan was deducted first. When the principal and interest were repaid in full next year, this deducted amount would be removed from the interest. However, everyone had to hand over guarantee rice first. If you planted five mu, you would measure out one dou per mu and deposit it in this loan society. If a household had more than ten mu, they would have to measure out five dou per mu. Once the rice ripened in the fields, regardless of the harvest, this guarantee rice had to be handed over first. The money borrowed from the loan society also had to be repaid in full when the rice ripened, otherwise, you couldn't borrow again next time. But in this village, hardly one in ten families didn't rely on this loan society. As soon as the rice ripened, they would first repay the borrowed debts, and then borrow again at the end of the year. If it weren't for these masters taking pity and doing good deeds, they wouldn't be able to get through the years.</p>
<p>Youfa sighed heavily and raised his right hand to touch his brush-like beard. He didn't understand how people who were only ten years younger than him had become so strange. His younger brother had always been diligent and hardworking, and he didn't talk much. He wasn't involved in anything in the village, but unexpectedly, after Hu Yongliang whispered something, he had become that annoying.</p>
<p>But how could he reply to Master Lu? If he said that Youcai's wife couldn't be a wet nurse, then the two hundred dollars couldn't be borrowed no matter what. If he dared to agree, then Youcai would be stubborn, and it seemed he definitely wouldn't agree.</p>
<p>The child's crying burst out from the kitchen again, the sound was very loud, as if it was a little angry. This crying interrupted Youfa's thoughts. He looked at the sky, the rain had lessened a bit, but the lead-like sky was still heavily pressing down on the ground, and it didn't seem like it would clear up for three or five days. So he resented the sky again. If it had rained a few days later, after they had harvested the rice and threshed the grain, then when there was really no other way, they could mortgage some of the grain for money, which might be hopeful. But now they had only harvested a little more than one mu of rice, what use was that!</p>
<p>At the same time, Master Lu puffed up his sparse ten beard hairs and also sighed heavily. But the sound wasn't as heavy as Youfa's. Although it was drawn out so long, it couldn't hide the proud and complacent look on his face.</p>
<p>"Master, don't worry so much, I'll definitely think of a way for you." Huang Zhongpu, sitting diagonally across from Master Lu, revealed a mouthful of yellow teeth, his face full of smiles, following Master Lu's sigh.</p>
<p>Master Lu didn't seem to hear. He only stared at the cigarette holder in his right hand. The ivory mouthpiece was newly bought from the city, half a foot long, said to be the most fashionable item. Although Master Lu didn't approve of newfangled things, he really approved of this cigarette holder. It was much better than a water pipe, more convenient, and more beautiful. He looked at the cigarette holder in a daze, only a fraction of his expression seemed like sighing, while seven fractions were admiring the ivory mouthpiece.</p>
<p>Huang Zhongpu's smile receded by half, and the yellow teeth were exposed outside for more than a minute, but Master Lu didn't show any movement, so he closed his lips, moistened his row of yellow teeth with his tongue, and said with a smile again:</p>
<p>"Master, don't worry, getting a Ningxin is worth a little trouble. Changing wet nurses, you, the Lu family, just have to say you want a wet nurse, and who wouldn't want to come? Let Master be picky."</p>
<p>Master Lu's eyes finally left the ivory mouthpiece, and he gently flicked the mouthpiece with his index finger, the fingernail making an extremely crisp sound against the ivory, and a pile of ashes floated to the ground. Then he took two heavy puffs, and while puffing out smoke, he said:</p>
<p>"But I want things done as quickly as possible. Didn't you say that Youcai's wife's milk is very good? Then definitely have her come try first."</p>
<p>"But... but that money,"</p>
<p>"That money, I'll only be willing to lend it once they agree. I want my wet nurse, I'm not afraid of not having anyone. If they don't agree, let them borrow from someone else."</p>
<p>Master Lu spoke the last sentence with particular emphasis. He understood very well that if Youfa and the others wanted to borrow money at this time, there was no one else but him, Master Lu.</p>

<h3 id="e226">The Orchestra's Hybrid Incongruity <a href="#e226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— Chen</p>
<p>The result of "Chinese learning as the fundamental structure, Western learning for practical application" has been to add a lot of power to our "Eastern civilization." On a grand scale, things like guns and electric chairs have greatly improved the technology of killing and torture. On a small scale, things like radios and gramophones have expanded the scope of "Yangzhou tunes," "Wuxi scenery," and even "Namo Amitabha," making them "popular." In between, after the shouts of "Avoidance" and "Silence," a "Red-Headed Sikh" cavalry patrol is deployed, and before the "four-person sedan chair," a weak military band performs. In this "international city" and other large cities, we often display the wonderful scene of bringing together ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign.</p>
<p>The phenomenon itself is, in fact, already bizarre and incongruous. However, from famous officials and wealthy merchants to ordinary citizens, whenever there is a "white or red auspicious occasion," they all regard it as a necessary "grand display." It seems that not doing so is not enough to express "mourning" or "celebration," but in fact, it is not enough to express "ostentation." The result of "ostentation" is a lot of jokes, especially in this "ten-mile foreign concession" where "Chinese and foreigners are watching," it is really "damaging to the national image." Therefore, the authorities have taken measures to ban it, and in terms of "manifesting solemnity and encouraging good customs," it is indeed a pleasing and welcome measure.</p>
<p>I think that many lucky people in China, if they have a national character, would not sacrifice a hair to benefit the world. If they have no national character, they will do everything they can to indulge in the ostentatious and exaggerated rituals of "aristocratic families." The banners of a certain "hall" that we see in Shanghai for "weddings, funerals, and sacrifices" are often even greater and more magnificent than the police force in an anti-enemy expedition. As this trend spreads, cavalry patrols, Red-Headed Sikhs, theatrical stages, trumpets, monks, Taoists, firecrackers, military bands, and all kinds of musical instruments and the nine streams of society are pulled together. Thus, the wooden signs of "Avoidance" and "Silence" cause ordinary citizens to rub shoulders and the roads to be blocked. This kind of thing is really no different from a "thousands-of-years-old, tens-of-thousands-of-miles" antique exhibition.</p>
<p>So, if it is said that the orchestra's playing of popular tunes at funerals and mournful music at wedding banquets is "unseemly," then putting so many different and varied things together is not necessarily able to "manifest solemnity and encourage good customs"!</p>
<h3 id="e227">Night Crossing <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Zhi</p>
<p>A group of five people, all driven by a kind of curiosity, a beautiful imagination, and a long-held yearning, bravely embarked on the country road at night, regardless of everything.</p>
<p>It was around the tenth day of the lunar month, and the waxing crescent moon hung diagonally in a corner of the sky. The countryside was bathed in silver light, but the scenery in the distance was hazy and indistinct.</p>
<p>The five people walked at a not-so-fast pace, lightly floating in the sea of moonlight as if swimming. The narrow field path was bordered by boundless wheat fields. The heavily laden wheat stalks leaned towards the road, and the ears and leaves of wheat often brushed against the lower clothes and socks of the night travelers.</p>
<p>However, they paid no attention to these, but concentrated their attention on one focal point, which was how to make this short trip more interesting and meaningful. Everyone was talking and laughing enthusiastically. Some were even smoking cigarettes, and the gray-white smoke curled up into the air, slowly thinning and disappearing.</p>
<p>The three-mile-long country road slipped under the excited feet of the several people, as if they didn't even notice. It wasn't until they heard the dogs barking wildly in Maohutou Village ahead that everyone seemed to wake up from a dream and realize that they had reached the lake.</p>
<p>The people in the village were not asleep yet, and some were still eating dinner. Many people noticed these five strange young men, and quickly surrounded them. But the villagers had no malice at all, just surprise. When the young men explained that they wanted to hire a boat to cross the lake, several boatmen scrambled to solicit business.</p>
<p>The young men decided to hire that person's boat and followed him to the lake (which was actually only fifty or sixty feet away in front of the village). In order, they each stepped onto the "gangplank" and crawled into the cabin. The boatman also boarded the boat, making a total of two people; one punted at the bow and the other rowed at the stern. With everything arranged, the boat skillfully sailed towards the dark Mount Fujiao in the middle of the lake.</p>
<p>The boat was specially used for crossing the lake, so it was called a "lake-crossing boat." It was different from those boats that navigate the inland rivers; it had two extra wings. That is, there were two planks on both sides of the boat, dragged in the water. In this way, you didn't have to worry about the lake waves being frantic, and you could sail safely.</p>
<p>"Mate, how long does it take to cross the lake?"</p>
<p>"Today, the wind is favorable, and the waves are not big. In the time it takes to smoke two cigarettes, you can definitely reach Mount Fujiao." The boatmen didn't have watches. They didn't know exactly how many minutes it would take to reach the other shore, but they used cigarettes to test it, and experience made their answers very confident.</p>
<p>The young men already knew that the lake was ten miles wide, but they didn't expect that it would only take the time to smoke two cigarettes to cross. This was new knowledge for them. Because of this, everyone was even happier and felt that the trip was more valuable. Therefore, although the boat was swaying slightly there, and the lake waves were constantly slapping against the hull and making splashing sounds, they didn't care at all and didn't feel the slightest fear.</p>
<p>The moon was dragged behind the boat, illuminating the surface of the waves, and was constantly smashed to pieces by the oars. Every ray of moonlight shot on the bulging wave crest, just like the back of every glistening water snake, forever chasing the boat and swimming forward.</p>
<p>The lake at night was empty and vast, and its borders were indistinct and boundless. There was only this one boat sailing, which made it seem even more lonely and serene. However, the hearts of the young men were hot, and they hoped for the arrival of the other shore; everyone's eyes were fixed on the cigarette butt of a young man who was calculating the distance.</p>
<p>When the second cigarette had been smoked for the most part, the boatman shouted that Mount Fujiao had arrived. The young men paid a generous boat fare and jumped ashore one by one. Everyone's heart was filled with new excitement and new charm.</p>
<h3 id="e228">Fog <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Xia Yin</p>
<p>For several days, the misty, foggy weather has been truly annoying. When there is no fog, the clear sky in the morning, the fields under the bright sun, and the sunset over the willow forest in this corner of the small building are all like a close-up shot, unfolding in a picturesque way in the east and west windows. Although I am not a poet or a painter, and cannot think of a beautiful poem in this scenery, or paint a picture, I can indeed feel a comfortable intoxication and a fresh and beautiful satisfaction from the silent prospect. Rather than saying that this is leisure and idle pleasure, it is more appropriate to say that the tired body and mind, especially for the gentle and relaxed environment, need and feel more deeply the state of things. Therefore, the melancholy that the dense fog has given me in these past few days has been particularly turbid and dull, like suddenly covering my eyes with a white gauze, a hazy and turbid piece, unable to distinguish direction, height, width, or narrowness; even breathing has an unnatural feeling, as if isolated from the world. Therefore, I cannot help but hate the fog, even curse the fog, and feel infinite annoyance and discomfort in my heart.</p>
<p>People always love to have a bright world that can provide freedom, galloping, and activity. Although the fog does not yet hinder me or restrict my activities in human affairs, it does have an invisible and silent curse, blinding my heart and blurring my eyes, making me seem to be trapped in a turbid sea of ​​water and foam; just like an airplane or a ship in foggy weather, no matter how great its power, it cannot be freely exerted and used at this time. Although there are still fixed routes in the sky, rivers, and seas in the fog. Although the fog will not turn the universe into darkness, it will remove a mass of bottomless turbidity and obscurity from the universe.</p>
<p>I remember once at sea, when the ship encountered a thick fog, it was already dark night, the fog covered the sea densely, obscuring the light of the lighthouse, and all around was an endless darkness. The humid sea breeze, mixed with the cold of December, blew people shivering, and the sea waves beat against the hull, making angry sighs. Far away, the warning whistle of the lighthouse, passing through the foggy night sea, was drawn out, from high to weak, like an animal crying, eerily and indifferently radiating on the foggy night sea. The whistle on the ship also wailed, and then the frequent bell sounds rang intermittently, a kind of terrifying and tense air that made people suspect that the ship was in danger. In this way, I spent the night in the terrifying alarm whistle and the sound of chaotic bells until the fog cleared the next day and the ship set sail again. The terrifying impression that the fog gave me that time was so deep that every time I encountered a sea voyage, I would suspect that the fog would suddenly cover the sea, and I felt that the fog at sea was simply a cruel threat to the lives of seafarers.</p>

<h3 id="e230">Second Uncle <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Whenever I think of my maternal grandmother's house, I remember my second uncle, lying on the opium couch year after year, and my cousin, who was only eighteen and also addicted to opium. My mother would say with anger and sorrow:</p>
<p>—If it weren't for the sake of my elderly grandmother, I truly wouldn't want to step foot in the Zhang family's door again! Doesn't each visit only deepen my sorrow?</p>
<p>My grandmother's house wasn't exactly a scholarly family. Thanks to my maternal grandfather's lifelong diligence and thrift, he accumulated dozens of acres of land and a dyehouse of considerable size, making them a relatively prosperous family in the barren Changlin Village. Although my maternal grandfather came from a business background, he possessed a rare and admirable old-fashioned heart—a respected elder who fostered harmony among relatives and neighbors, earning him the villagers' respect and affection. In his later years, he lived in a two-story house with his children and grandchildren filling the halls, enjoying a life of comfort and ease.</p>
<p>However, this comfortable life was shattered two years before my maternal grandfather's death due to my second uncle's dissolute behavior and opium addiction, which caused him great sadness and anger. This also made my maternal grandfather think of his deceased eldest son, deepening the sorrow and pain in his heart. Before long, he breathed his last, passing away.</p>
<p>After becoming addicted to opium, my second uncle, fearing my maternal grandfather's authority, could only wander outside. Sometimes he would sneak back, but if my maternal grandfather found out, he would be driven out with his cane. During that time, my second uncle lived a very miserable life in opium dens. Later, when my maternal grandfather became critically ill, he was allowed to return. After my maternal grandfather's death, my second uncle seized control of the family, and the once well-to-do household began to decline under the suction of his opium pipe.</p>
<p>My maternal grandmother, accustomed to a life of leisure, only knew how to pray to Buddha and give alms. She was helpless against my second uncle's reckless spending. When her resentment became unbearable, she could only sigh and lament her misfortune in front of her daughters and daughters-in-law, complaining that she must have done something wrong in her past life to have given birth to such a troublesome son. Only my eldest aunt saw herself as my second uncle's nemesis, constantly nagging and scolding, scolding and then advising. However, when she discovered that her own son, my cousin, had also become addicted to opium, my eldest aunt, who was usually meticulous, concerned with appearances, extravagant, and fiercely competitive, was driven mad.</p>
<p>With my eldest aunt falling ill, my maternal grandmother became even more worried. But this made things much quieter for my second uncle. Even though the house was in constant turmoil, my second uncle, lying on his opium couch, felt at ease, contentedly indulging in his opium habit. With glazed eyes, he would drift into a dreamlike state, mentally planning his next moves while surrounded by the land deeds buried in the wooden pillow chest. My second uncle's opium addiction was truly terrifying. He consumed at least two ounces of opium paste day and night. Like a ghost, he lay there in the dim light of a small oil lamp. Except for eating, relieving himself, and taking the deeds out to find clients, he never took a single step out of his room.</p>
<p>One year, then two years passed. The land was gone, and the dyehouse had changed owners. By the third year—the third year after my maternal grandfather's death—although my eldest aunt's health was gradually improving, my second uncle began to worry about his opium supply, and my maternal grandmother, due to her repressed grief, developed an incurable wasting disease.</p>
<p>Soon, the opium lamp and smoking paraphernalia on my second uncle's couch ended up in the opium den as collateral. My second uncle returned to the miserable life he had led when he was driven out by my maternal grandfather. Once, my second uncle, dragging his broken shoes, came to our door with his head lowered in dejection. He begged my mother for a few coins, saying that he hadn't had a haircut in three months. However, my mother refused. Afterwards, I said that my mother was being too harsh, and her eyes reddened as she said:</p>
<p>—How could I not be heartbroken? But I had told him long ago that this day would come. I don't even have the ability to provide for my grandmother, how can I possibly take care of him! If your grandfather were still alive, I wouldn't be so… My mother's voice choked, and a shadow of sorrow passed before my eyes. I understood my mother's bitter heart.</p>
<h3 id="e231">My Humble Abode <a href="#e231" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c231" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">231</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Huan</p>
<p>When I happened to meet Mr. Zi Qiu on the street, as usual, he would begin the conversation with a forced smile and a phrase like, "The weather is fine today." So I took a closer look at Mr. Zi Qiu: still his withered limbs, and the large, shapeless robe that seemed to be draped over him; still his sharp shoulders; still his haggard face; still his eyes that seemed perpetually unfocused from lack of sleep; still that faded and frayed felt hat; still that demeanor of being intimidated by the harshness of reality, having fallen from the pinnacle of life and being seriously injured, burrowing into a dead end of self-pity, and trying to use alcohol and excessive sleep as a refuge, resulting in a muddled mind; still a string of stuttering words that seemed to betray his anxiety, confusion, and shyness due to his inability to express himself adequately: "You, you… have you been doing well lately—doing well? I, I, I—your brother has been, has been—please come to my humble abode sometime, please come to my humble abode sometime to chat. I've moved, uh, moved…"</p>
<p>As if he had touched upon something unpleasant again, Mr. Zi Qiu, without waiting for a reply, hastily bowed and disappeared into the crowd in the bright sunlight.</p>
<p>The phrase "humble abode" once again struck my senses. These are only two simple syllables, but when spoken by Mr. Zi Qiu, they convey a sense of heaviness and suffocation. I seemed to see a snail slowly crawling along the base of a wall with its heavy shell; I seemed to taste the weight of a fallen mountain; I seemed to feel an infinitely heavy burden pressing down, forcing one to take heavy and difficult steps, step by step, towards the desolate wilderness of life, not knowing where the final resting place might be…</p>
<p>Mr. Zi Qiu already had a haggard face and unclear speech three years ago. At that time, I was living in a rented room in a pavilion in a southern metropolis; Mr. Zi Qiu was my neighbor, living upstairs in the main hall. He wasn't particularly old, but within his frighteningly thin frame, he always carried an unmistakable air of bitterness and sentimentality associated with the "broken shoe party." Even when arguing with the landlady about rent, he would try to embellish his arguments with quotations from the Thirteen Classics, but he often "couldn't remember them at the moment." In the end, he would simply mutter, "Only women and petty men are difficult to deal with!" This, to him, was as satisfying as Ah C's "Old man beating his son!"</p>
<p>So, there was always a quarrel at the end of each month, and after the quarrel, one could hear the woman's lamenting cries from the "humble abode"…</p>
<p>But finally, one day, as I was walking down the stairs, I met Mr. Zi Qiu. I nodded and greeted him as he bowed.</p>
<p>The second time I saw him while idly watching at the doorway, he insisted on dragging me to his "humble abode" upstairs in the main hall. This "humble abode" consisted of Mr. Zi Qiu himself, a wife with bound feet, a mother in her seventies, and various pieces of old furniture scattered around the room.</p>
<p>Then I listened to him talk about his family history, his father's lifetime as a candidate official who never got a real position, the changes in the world, the greatness of the Tongcheng School, the landlady's unreasonableness, and the difficulties of life… the burden of the "humble abode"…</p>
<p>"If it weren't for the few mouths to feed in this humble abode, I would have jumped into the Huangpu River long ago, following the Great Qing Emperor. Life is really hard now, it's difficult to survive with so many people."</p>
<p>What followed was a request to borrow some money to deal with the landlady: "You are… you probably don't care, but please, for the sake of the few mouths in this humble abode, please…"</p>
<p>I seemed to see a tragedy in the midst of this detestable vulgarity; but the decaying stench of a bygone era made me nauseous. In a surge of bitterness and annoyance, I didn't give him a reply and stood up and left.</p>
<p>But meeting Mr. Zi Qiu again now, I knew that the hunchbacked, foul-smelling "humble abode" was still alive and well; but Mr. Zi Qiu's appearance was definitely not as good as before…</p>

<p>The day before yesterday, "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm" and "Freedom " jointly went to Jiangwan to film horse racing. For a time, the sound of hooves galloped and the dust covered the sky, truly like thousands of troops and horses coming to kill. Ordinary people were amazed and competed to watch. At that time, the camera's lens had already been set up to capture this murderous scene into the lens.</p>
<p>Lu Liming, who entered the Electric Communication Company, loves to play in addition to filming "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm," especially Zhang Yunqiao's Great Wall built on the banks of Yinshan, which is majestic and continuous. She lingers and looks back, as if she can't bear to leave.</p>
<p>Miss Zhou Xuan, one of the three major singing stars at sea, went to Electric Communication the day before yesterday with Xu Jian to participate in the song and dance scenes in "Sons and Daughters in a Time of Storm." One holds a horsewhip and the other holds a seven-stringed instrument, showing a martial spirit and a unique style on the dance stage.</p>

<p>The emerging Electric Communication Company shows a spirit of assault in the progress of its new plan, and the work of each department is becoming more and more busy. The organization of the business department includes the distribution and publicity departments, as well as overseas offices. The director of the business department, Situ Shangsang, is stationed in Hong Kong to handle affairs, and all distribution and publicity departments are generally handled by Zhou Boxun. However, Zhou has recently played the leading role in Situ Huimin's "God of Freedom" and Yuan Muzhi's "City Scenery," and his affairs are overwhelmed, making it difficult for him to separate himself; therefore, he once discussed with manager Ma Dejian about the distribution aspect and specially hired Li Dashen to take charge. However, considering that the position of distribution is extremely important, Zhou Boxun was changed to secretary of the business department to jointly develop distribution affairs with Li. Li was originally the manager of Jincheng Grand Theater. Now, in response to the invitation of Electric Communication, he specially resigned to Liu Zhonghao, general manager of Jincheng, and Liu approved it generously. He has started working at Electric Communication on May 1, it is said.</p>

<p>After the concentration of all factories in Lianhua, director Sun Yu has two more sports to exercise his physique: riding a bicycle and climbing trees. Every day, except for rainy days, he always rides his old bicycle between the head office and the Tan residence. When he feels tired from writing a new script in the writing room, he runs to the open-air shadow ground and climbs on those big trees to rest. Climbing trees was originally his childhood stunt, and although he has been rusty for many years, his agile skills are still clearly present. He easily climbs to the trees, flying from one tree to another like a bird. He has the style of "Tarzan," but it's a pity he can't shout.</p>

<p>"Night Fragrance" is a brand-new tragedy written and directed by Cheng Bugao. Its content is tragic, telling the story of a flower girl (played by Hu Die). Every time the lights come on, she carries a flower basket to the entrance of dance halls, cafes, or bars to sell "Night Fragrance." She supports herself, but eventually cannot escape the influence of the extravagant society, becomes obsessed with vanity, and falls into a situation from which she cannot extricate herself. Although she tries her best to struggle, it is all in vain. In the process of depicting the ill-fated woman, we can also see the environment around her, the silhouette of this turbulent era, such as the bankruptcy of villages, the corruption of cities, the frequent foreign insults, the hard lives of the masses, and the panic of professions, which can be said to be sentimental and eventful, very tortuous.</p>
<p>"Night Fragrance" is just waiting for Hu Die to return to film the remaining scenes, and it can be completed successfully.</p>

<p>— Liu Ji Piao</p>
<p>E (X-Ray Department) The location must be dry and not damp. It must also have a place where patients can enter and exit conveniently. The scale can be small:</p>
<p>(1) Fluoroscopy Room - Combining the radiology room and treatment room into one. 2 - Diagnostic office. 3 - Darkroom. 4 - Waiting room. Larger scale includes: 1 - One or more radiology rooms. 2 - One or more fluoroscopy rooms. 3 - Diagnostic and office. 4 - Treatment room. 5 - Darkroom. 6 - Waiting room. 7 - Changing room. Generally, this is the case. However, the number of rooms must be determined based on economic conditions and needs.</p>
<p>The ceiling should not be lower than 10 (from the floor to the bottom of the beam). The inner wall must be covered with lead (for fluoroscopy rooms and radiology rooms). The doors of these two rooms should also be wrapped in lead. If there are sickrooms on the upper and lower floors, the floors and ceilings of these two rooms should also be covered with to prevent light.</p>
<p>f. (Anatomy Department) Must be located in the basement. Close to the elevator and in a place where patients cannot see it when entering and exiting.</p>
<p>g. (Pharmaceutical Department) The pharmacy, material room, and testing room should all have northern light.</p>
<p>h. (Staff Dormitory) Regardless of the size of the hospital, the problem of staff accommodation must be resolved. Because mental fatigue occurs after work, there should be adequate rest. Therefore, the dormitory location must be close to the hospital and provide recreational enjoyment. Therefore, a tennis court and outdoor sports facilities are essential. Doctors with families need residential-style houses, so the design should also take this issue into account.</p>
<p>Nurse Dormitory and School. It is better for the nurse dormitory to be independent. However, it must also be connected to the hospital by a corridor. Common rooms should accommodate two people. Bathrooms and toilets should be opened separately. But it must be accessible from the bedroom. And it must be available for four or five people. Each floor is equipped with a small kitchen and sewing room. Public living rooms. Reception room. Gymnasium. Rain showers, etc. should also be set up as much as possible. There should be a gate near the street, and it is not necessary to pass through the hospital when entering. The nursing school can be located in the dormitory. But it can also be independent. The designer should make temporary arrangements based on his needs.</p>
<p>i. (Cooking Department) The cooking department must be located in a place that is convenient for entering and exiting and easy to supply goods. Set up another door so that it does not interfere with the hospital's business. But it must be close to the elevator, with a general kitchen inside. Kitchens that regulate diet. Dining rooms for nurses, supervisors. Workers and staff. Cooking management room.</p>
<p>j. (Boiler Room) The boiler room can be attached to the inside of the hospital or independent. Those attached to the inside must be close to the entrance and exit for supplying goods. If there is sufficient funding, it is best to set it in an independent location. This can make everything convenient.</p>
<p>k. (Laundry Room) It should be located in the basement, preferably under the children's ward. Because the children's spirits will not be disturbed by the washing work. However, the ceiling must also be constructed with soundproofing methods. If an independent location is taken, it is best to set it on the upper floor of the boiler room.</p>
<p>The above are just the essentials of each item. However, each hospital has its own conditions and needs. The designer should inspect the situation temporarily and determine the plan. The above points cannot be solved one by one. (End)</p>

<p>——Regarding use in construction sites——</p>
<p>Pump - In construction sites, the places flooded by accumulated water sometimes cause considerable harm to the work. Supervisors should always order small workers to pump dry with water-drawing equipment. This water-drawing equipment is called a pump. (Pump) Just like the sheet pile is called Waling, it is also taken from transliteration.</p>
<p>Knot - Foreign pine materials are divided into net goods and substandard goods. (That is, the meaning of first-class and second-class.) The quality of net goods is relatively sophisticated. It has been through a selection process. Substandard goods have many damaged places. The problem mostly comes from the knot. Foreign pine materials with knots cannot be used for decoration. However, some people often like to be greedy for cheap. They buy a large batch of substandard goods at low prices for decoration. As a result, things happen where small gains are lost. First. Carpenters must waste a selection effort. Second. Chop off the place of the knot. This kind of "waste of time and materials" uneconomical method is the most unworthy. However, this kind of substandard goods is excellent for making cement shells.</p>
<p>Workbench - The long bench on which carpenters do work is collectively called a workbench.</p>
<p>Foot soaking - For city houses built on three floors, the bottom part can sometimes reduce pressure, so there is no need to use large bottom foot materials. Then. It is bound to increase the pier of the pillars. It seems that this is a certain principle. No matter what is accompanied by something, the larger the foot, the higher the height of its upper body. The part where this pier and the pillar body are connected is called foot soaking (Buttess)</p>
<p>Cap - There is another piece of cement board two or three inches thick on top of the parapet wall (Purapet), chimney top, etc. This is the cap. (Apitel)</p>
<p>Jump mouth - The area of the gutter (Gutter) is relatively wide, so the distance of the jump mouth is large. But what part does this jump mouth refer to? That is the place of the outer angle. Almost sophisticated houses. When plasterers do line feet, they often feel extremely difficult because of pulling horses.</p>
<p>Filler - What is called filler (Plate)? It is a kind of thin piece of foreign pine and other materials used to fill up the mark of an insufficient size of the same equipment.</p>
<h3 id="e240">Design of Outdoor Swimming Pools <a href="#e240" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c240" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">240</a></h3>
<p>— Xiao Ang</p>
<p>The weather is gradually becoming hot, and the ladies of Shanghai feel a special enthusiasm and need for swimming. Indeed, swimming is one of the best forms of exercise. It can train your body and relieve the heat and boredom. However, in a place like Shanghai, people who love swimming often feel the lack of swimming pools and the carelessness of the facilities. It is true that swimming in China has only been promoted in recent years, so it is no wonder that architects have neglected its design. However, looking at the current trend, the construction of swimming pools will definitely increase year by year, and their design must be improved day by day. The Royal Institute of British Architects once published a paper detailing the design of outdoor swimming pools, which is very detailed. Let me introduce it briefly.</p>
<p>(1) Site Selection</p>
<p>The most important issue in choosing the location of an outdoor swimming pool is the water supply. Some take water from the sea, others from waterworks or wells. In short, the source must be abundant and the quality clean. If it is a seaside swimming pool, the closer to the seaside, the better, because the water supply will be much more convenient. The seating for spectators may be larger and higher, so that those who have finished swimming can enjoy the taste of the sea and the sky. If it is an inland outdoor swimming pool, there must be green lawns, tennis courts, and sports fields around it. The best location is in a park. There is one in Hongkou Park in Shanghai, and other parks should also have one.</p>
<p>(2) Buildings</p>
<p>A. The office should have a ticket office</p>
<p>B. The locker room should have a locker for men and women.</p>
<p>C. One toilet for men and women.</p>
<p>D. Bathing room: Before swimming, you must wash your whole body with warm water to avoid catching a cold and to keep the pool clean. One for men and one for women.</p>
<p>E. Swimming pool, F. Coffee shop, etc. for swimmers to rest</p>
<p>G. Stands for competitions</p>
<p>(3) Swimming Pool Design</p>
<p>The smallest swimming pool must be 25 meters long and 10 meters wide. The largest swimming pool is 100 meters long and 50 meters wide. One-third of the length is very shallow for children and beginners. Two-thirds of the length is a bit deeper, with the deepest part being three to five meters.</p>
<p>Most swimming pools are made of reinforced concrete and painted with white cement on all sides, because this kind of construction is impermeable to water. Many swimming pools are plastered around with colored cement and marble fragments. This kind of architecture is the most magnificent.</p>
<p>On one side of the swimming pool, there should be a ladder every ten meters for entering and exiting the pool.</p>
<p>The diving board should be placed at the deepest end of the water. Most of them are made of elastic wood and covered with palm felt to prevent slipping.</p>
