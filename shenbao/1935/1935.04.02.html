<p>凡有靑年子女就學於中學之父母。莫不關心於中學之敎育。父母之於子女。平時所期者力學。所戒者荒嬉。而此時則轉有蹙然以其學業爲可憂者。問所苦。不曰工作過繁重。卽日課程不適宜。</p>
<p>初中每週授課三十四至三十五小時。有人估計。比法國中學第四級多十二或十三小時。比德國文理科中學第三級多五或六小時。高中每週授課三十一至三十四小時。此法國中學哲學級多八至十一小時。比德國文理科中學第一級多二至五小時。法德中學之嚴格陶冶。世界稱最。而我國中學之課業。繁重過之。以授課與在校自習時間合計。初中學生每週工作四十八小時。高中學生每週工作六十小時。加以月考。期考。會考。之層層重壓。造成精神上不斷的恐懼與極度的緊張。姑置生活敎育。生產敎育於不談卽此書本。知識之能否從容吸收而融會。亦成疑問。至其影響靑年身心之發育。而問接以影響將來民族之健康者。尤非細事也。</p>
<p>高中課程。曩曾採分科選科之制。近年以大學升學之需要。謂宜提高程度。一反前之所爲。高中學生。不分男女。不論升學不升學。不問升學修習者爲文法商抑理工醫。一律施以固定劃一之課程。其中如算學一科。一律須習代數。幾何。三角。及解析幾何大意。尤爲多數靑年所餒憚。一測其程度則會考成續。仍以算學一科爲最劣。蓋人之心智不同。任何考試。亦無法强而同之也。而論者又沾沾引歐洲中學爲模楷。指斥分科之制。以爲徒襲美國敎育之皮毛。不察中學程度之降低。與師資。敎材。方法。設備。以至整個學風都有關係。絕非一單種之分科問題。必欲以歐美中學相比。則據吾人所確知。歐洲升學預備之中學。其分校。分班。分組。遠過於美國中學之僅以升學與職業分科。夫各國中學之辦法。載在文書。有目共覩。不難覆按。且因材施敎之一簡單原則。根本上無待詳徵各國先例。事實而後證明。顧事實一也。原則一也。而十年來敎育界之議論。先後如此分岐。令人百。思而不得其解。</p>
<p>最近敎育部制定省市中學師範敎育研究會辦法大綱。令各省市卽晶成立研究會。並限五月底以前。將研究結果報部。吾人深信中學校長及敎育專家參與此重要會議者。必能因應所宜。平情研究。而不以個人之好惡。爲公共之是非。則靑年敎育之前途。有厚幸矣。</p>

<p>（日內瓦）德國至明年三月實力已足、當又可以應付大戰矣、此項驚人消息、係國聯會員國之高級軍事參贊今日向美聯社所發表、據稱、德國政府自去年十月起已開始製造鉅量戰爭用品、此項製造計劃可於十六至十七個月以內完成、軍事專家大半皆估計德國已有飛機三千三百架、駕駛員稱是、而英國祗有二千二百架、法國亦不過五千架、法國官塲表示、德國目前雖尙缺乏大轟炸機、然已趕速大批製造、且其品質亦優於他國之飛機、並聞德國陸軍部早已計劃製造最新式之武器、根型業已銷燬、惟圖樣則妥爲保存、以備將來參考、及至去年十月、希特勒元首下令開始製造、全國卽一致動工、至明年三月、已能足敷德國新軍之應用、並可有不少準備、昨日德國駐英使館雖已否認德國空軍卽不優於英國、亦已與英國相等、若干軍事方面、頗不信此說云、（一日國民電）</p>
<p>強迫軍役　實施方法</p>
<p>（柏林）德國違反和約擴大陸軍之舉動、定今日開始實施、據目前估計、德國兵力共有七十五萬人、據可恃消息、强迫軍役制之實施方法如下、一九一五年級共五十八萬人、將於今日召集、其中三十萬人將入營服務、至於一九〇一年至一九〇九年之各級、將於此後數年內受短期之軍事訓練、每次不過八星期、一九〇一年級將於今年十月一日召集、第二批則於明年四月一日召集、聞選擇甚嚴、而對於已婚者及專門職業人材將予以特殊考慮、新兵居住等籌備、刻在積極進行中、不久將宣佈一種國防新法律、創立國防行政會、歐戰時著名之魯登道夫與席克特將軍、將爲此會中量有勢力之人物、財長因海陸軍需欵浩大、現正絞其腦汁、以求預算平衡之方法、同時爲使德國繼續前進、現巳頒佈一種特殊法律、授權財長擔任若干保證、如籌欵二萬萬馬克以提倡德國出口貿易、籌欵一萬萬馬克充增多工作之經費、並籌欵八千八百萬馬克爲農業經費等是（一日路透電）</p>
<p>兵力總數　達九百萬</p>
<p>（柏林）據軍界消息、德國兵力總數、除前曾參加歐戰之各級不計外、約有九百萬人之多、其從事於强迫工役者、將爲服軍役之初步準備、凡自一九〇一年至一九一五年之各級、均須應徵入伍、其中自一九〇一年至一九〇九年之各級、應受軍事訓練八星期、自一九一〇年至一九一五年之各級則訓練六個月或一年、因此德國之兵力有如下述、（一）國防軍、原則上有職業兵十萬人、（二）白航空部長戈林將軍部下綠衣隊及黑衣保衛隊中所徵調之職業兵、其總數在十萬人以上、（三）自各級中徵調之新兵、其中一九一五年級約有六十萬人、一九一六年級約有四十萬人、一九一七年級約有三十五萬人、一九一八年級約有三十萬人、故軍額問題就數字而論、固不難解决、</p>
<p>國家財政　增重負擔</p>
<p>惟就財政而論、則困難仍屬甚多、蓋德國入伍徵兵、每名每天須發餉銀四十分尼、其妻室每月發給贍養金四十五馬克、此外兒女養育費及房金尙不在內、故每一徵兵入伍、不免使國家增加鉅額之負担、按前國防部長薛克德將軍主張成立職業突擊隊、而以徵兵補充之、此項原則已經政府拋棄、而改採强迫軍役之原則、此項原則在理論上、應使全國皆兵、而在實際上則在數年內職業軍隊仍不過二十萬人、惟此外更益以徵兵軍額而已、</p>
<p>參謀本部　正式恢復</p>
<p>又新頒法律規定恢復參謀本部、（按凡爾賽和約禁止德國設參謀本部）前參謀總長魯登陶夫已正式恢復原職、此外並由陸海軍代表聯合組織最高軍事會議、現在中國助蔣介石將軍剿匪之席克特將軍亦將返國、參加最高軍事會議云、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>元首喉舌　對外宣言</p>
<p>德國喀爾魯赫城　宣傳部長戈培爾頃在此間發表宣言、略謂「吾人决不威脅他國、然亦不能忍受他國之威脅、吾國今復成爲主權完整之國家矣德國並不思戰爭、凡謂德國從事戰爭者、其人必係多言必失之兇徒、世所謂德國要求波蘭走廊及捷克與奧國領士之一部分、暨阿爾薩斯勞倫兩省及其他領士、均完全出於僞造、外國報紙登載此種虛僞新聞、實足以擾亂世界之和平、所望全世界人民互相尊重、以奠定和平之基礎、德國自當爲此種和平而効力、德國健兒尤願爲和平而獻身」云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（莫斯科）英攀璽大臣艾登來此與蘇俄當局討論綏靖因德國决議重整軍備所引起之歐洲危局後、已獲俄當局與英合作以謀和平之諾言，會議旣畢、發表公報、聲明英俄願合作以求和平、文內謂雙方之談話、涉及國際現局之主要事件、如東歐公約與二月三日英法公報中所舉各事、皆在其列、（按英法公報中聲明維持奧國獨立與完整之必要、主張邀德國合作、反對以片面行爲否認國際義務、歡迎締結歐洲互助公約、建議以一種協定代替凡爾賽和約施於德國之軍備限制條文、德國重返國聯、締結天空公約、）</p>
<p>雙方談話　誠摯友好</p>
<p>艾登與　李維諾夫並曾討論英俄關係以後之發展與增進、艾登且與史丹林莫洛托夫交換此問題之意見、雙方談話始終在友好與誠摯之空氣中進行、艾登曾以柏林英德談話之情形告知李維諾夫、雙方皆以爲此種談話有助於澄淸歐洲之大局、</p>

<p>艾李史莫四人　並以爲在目前之國際大局中、依照國聯原則竭力造成如二月三日英法公報所言歐洲集團的安全之制度、實爲急不容緩之舉、史莫李三人又切實聲明東歐安全之組織、與互助公約之締結、並非志在包國任何一國、或使陷於孤立之地位、實圖造成參加國之平等安全、故殊歡迎德國與波蘭之滲加、蓋此足使該問題獲最圓滿之解决也、</p>
<p>英俄利益　毫無觝觸</p>
<p>英俄政府之　代表誠摯交換意見後、皆認兩政府問對國際政策之任何主要事件、目下亳無利益抵觸之處、此足爲兩國切實合作以求和平之堅固基礎、且信兩國旣認和平可使被此同獲裨益、則自將以合作之精神並忠於其爲國聯會員之議務而支配相互之關係、艾史莫李四人鑒於此種理由、確認彼等抱同一意見、覺兩國以友好之精神協力經營和平與安全集團的組織之一般工作、實爲增進國際努力以達此目的之第一重要之舉、（卅一日路透電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）關於公報中希望德國波蘭參加東歐互助公約一節、蘇俄負責人士申說所謂「最佳解决辦法者」、其意非謂德波兩國參加、係屬唯一解决辦法也、現知上項公報、原定午後六時（俄國鐘點）公布、惟因艾登欲電詢英國政府同意、是以展遲、嗣聞倫敦復電電到達後、邁斯基（蘇聯駐英大使）曾在外交委員會與英國大使館往返跋涉數次、始將公報文字確定云、（三十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>邦交增進　顯明象徵</p>
<p>（倫敦）每日電聞報之外交通訊員重視史丹林個人對於英俄談話之重要供獻、據稱艾登對於蘇俄狄克推多之印象、不僅認史丹林對於國際問題有透澈之觀察、對於他國特徵亦有深切之暸解、此事實堪慶幸、因其可使史丹林暸解英國不能爲東歐安全制度中積極份子之理由也、該通訊員續稱、莫斯科官報中所載東歐和平組織目的並不在於包圍任何國家、或使任何國家孤立、將受倫敦方面之歡迎、官報中所稱不侵犯之原則及兩國對於國聯之忠忱、可視爲共產主義之蘇俄與資本主義之英國、邦交顯然增進之象徵云、每日傳聞報復以「英俄之競爭已終止」為標題、冠於艾登離開莫斯科之消息、並稱自艾登與史丹林及李維諾夫會談後、雙方均以二國對於世界問題之意見若是其接近爲異云、（一日國民社電）</p>

<p>發表宣言　上海市兒童幸福會兒童電影委員會、月光大戲院合辦之兒童電影日、咋發表宣言云、二十世紀、是兒童的世紀如果不嫌武斷、那麼我們還可以這樣說、今後的電影、應該是兒童的電影、因爲有新的兒童、才能有新的國家、可是要希望有新的兄童、首先要有創造新的兒童的工具、創造新兒童的工具、自然很多、但我們以爲最有效的莫過於電影、今後之教育、應以電影爲中心、電影的發明家安迪生早已告訴我們了、然而電影雖則爲創造新兒童的工具、但也能使兒童起不良的作用、例如在歐洲電影往往爲製造惡少年之東西一般從感化院中逃出來的不良少年、遇見於電影院內、乃爲常見之事、考查他們逃走的原因、實由於嗜好電影所致、故關心敎育及研究保護兒童者、對於兒童電影問題、不可不有深切之認識、歐美各國對於兒童觀覽電影、特爲規定放映時間、又必須與他們家長同往、例如德國各都市、凡未滿六歲的兒童、絕對不許觀覽電影、（電國電影法第二條之規定）又十四歲乃至十八歲以下的兒童、非有他們的父兒作伴、不得入塲觀戰、他若英國·美國·丹麥·瑞典、以及意大利等、限制亦甚嚴厲、不消說他們所以這樣的限制、不外爲防制兒童惡劣行爲、並且這其間、還有二種理由、一方面因爲電影爲兒童所愛好、在此種塲合、所以利用他們的模仿性、餋成其向善之心、另一方面就健康的見地說、譬如英國自十四歲乃至十七歲以下的兒童、每一週間映演一回、時在一小時以上電影、藉以助長他們的發育、我國對於這個問題、似尚未過細老盧、所以電影塲內、往往有嬰孩的啼哭聲、少年的喧嘩聲、此種現象、殊非所宜、藍人類模仿性、在兒童時期最爲發達、如果觀覽影片之際、不加相當限制、則舉凡電影片上之各種不良動作、俱將遂一模仿、而不能自覺、就上海市而論、大小電影院、爲數雖達四十以上、然其所映影片、大概爲愛情武俠偵探等類、所以兒童觀覽之後、就在無形中餋成竊盜行爲、或淫靡思想了、有人說、上海的學校教育、因爲被不良電影所影饗、所以未能擭得充分的效果、實在不算過分、兒童幸福委員會有鑒於此、爰特邀集有關係各方、組織了一個兒童電影委員會、研究討論電影問題、並經得到月光大戲院的同意、特為規定兒童觀覽的時日、命名兒童電影日一、在這規定時日、專映適合兒童需要有益身心的影片、俾切實爲他們謀得一些福利、我們希冀由月光而擴展至全市乃至全國的電影院、都有這樣的規定呢、不敢說即此便可創造新的中國的新兒童、却是有了這連傾向與願望、</p>

<h3 id="c196">大夏大學贊成　減少假期縮短學年　並提出先决條件七條 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>中央委員孫科等、向五中全會所提之縮短學年與减少假期一案、經中政會議决、由教育部分令各大學、從學理上加以研究、北方各大學有反對者、其理由已見報端、茲聞本埠大夏大學亦接到該項訓令、前日由王校長召集討論會歐副校長元懷提出意見書、當由教務長魯繼曾、教育學院院長邰爽秋、文學院院長吳澤霖、師專科主任童　年、附中主任倪文亞、教授陳一百等、貢獻意見、對歐之意見書、略有修改、於二十八日繕就呈部、藉供參考、該意見書、對於威少假期縮短學年問題、原則上大體贊同、但對於實施方面、附有幾個先决問題、全文長達萬言、茲錄其要點如次、</p>
<p>意見要點　（一）教材與時間分配間題、就各級學校課程與時間支配上來觀察、學年長短、固是一個問題、而　更重要的問題、還是如何的利用敎學時間、（二）學制年限問題、就世界各國現行學制及中國三十年來學制變更的沿革來看、學制年限或長或短、沒有統一固定的辦法、祇要爲現階級環境的需要、儘有伸縮的可能性、（三）歷年假期的增减問題、我國放假日期、自民元至現在、均有不少變更這表示假期很有活動的餘地、並有傾向於减少的趨勢、（四）假期在教育上的價値問題、在理論上假期、自有不少教育價値、但實際上、學生每不能利用假期、甚或反使學業荒廢、養成不良的習慣、（五）犬氣寒熱、對於教學影響問題、據桑戴克氏的研究發現、我人若能鼓勵學生、竭力工作、則在熱濕陳腐及停滯的空氣內工作的成續與在理想情形下工作相同、而歷屆的暑假學校成績優良、亦未聞有發生什麼衛生上的流弊、</p>
<p>先決條件　（一）中學科目繫重、上課時數過多、與其縮短學年、不如把威少假期、所多出來的時間、拿來分配在每週間補充教學、使學生負担較輕課業內容、校爲嫻熟、（二）注意學生實習與社會聯絡方面、因假期縮短、學生與社會接觸機會較少、學校應每學期規定若干時間、併學生實習、使與社會不生隔閡、（三）政府應注意畢業生出路問題、因學年縮短、每年畢業生愈多、出路問題、自更不易解决、（四）對於各級學校的行政管理設備、以及入學年齡等方面、均須重新釐定標準、以求健全合理化、對於教師方面、應增高待遇、實行年功加俸及飬老金制度、並應增加人數、俾於一星期內、輪流休假一日、於一年或二年內、輪流休假數月、繼續進行、若將大中兩部、改爲學季制、此點更易辦到、（九）應多留各地方上伸縮的餘地、寒署假最好辦法、規定溫熱濕度達到若干度時、酌放幾天、否則概不放假、（六）實施步驟、最好先由教部指定南北幾個大學中學小學、先行試騐試騐結果、確有成續、再擴充及於一般學校、（七）附帶說明的承認夜校及署期學校的學分也就是縮短學年的辦法、聞歐元懷之意見書、將在五月號敎育雜誌發表、以就教於教育界同志云、</p>

<p>— （周庭芳）</p>
<p>酒有時誠然是一種可貴的藥物，但有時也未始不是一種强烈的誘惑劑。英國大戲曲家莎士比亞有幾句咒詛酒的絕妙好詞：「呀！人們竟然以仇敵投諸口中，任其盜取他們的腦髓！呀！我們竟只管歡樂地酣飮，把自己變成了獸類」。</p>
<p>但酒的弊害不過是較著的一種，其他像吸食鴉片姻紅丸等，那更如莎翁所說的「以仇敵投諸口中」了。菱湖昭</p>
<h3 id="c215">喜馬拉雅山探險 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 淡雲</p>
<p>探險的利益是無窮的，哥倫布因爲有探險的精神，所以能發見新大陸，這便是最好的例證，保守常可以促成一個民族减亡：而胃險進取却可以使一個民族繁昌。歐美民族，最富於冒險進取的精神，可見他們國家的强盛，並不是無因的。</p>
<p>誰都知道喜馬拉雅由的額非爾士高峯，是世界最高的山峯，約有二九，一四一呎高，這上面終年積雪，寒氣砭骨，是生物不能居住的地方。在一般儒怯的人，是决不敢跑上去探險的，可是歐美的探險家，却有一種明明知道不能够而一定要去做的戇勁，常常想作喜馬拉雅山的探險。喜馬拉雅山的探險，到現在己經有過好幾次了，可是每次除了犧牲若干條的性命之外，至今還沒有得到什麽具體的結果。</p>
<p>最近聽說又有一隊「一九三五年法國喜馬拉雅登山團」將由艾斯加拉氏率領，於本年度登由探險。難道他們不顧前車之鑒嗎？難道他們不惜寳貴的生命嗎？不，他們因爲有了胃險進取的精神的驅使，才敢幹此偉大的舉動，這種精神，是很値得我們佩服的。</p>

<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>當我每次從家中到上海來，走過一條曾經戰刦而變爲冷落荒僻的寳山路時，總碰者這樣的一位仁兄：一身破舊而兼汚穢的西裝，因爲裏頭沒有櫬衫的綠故，逢着裂縫和洞穴的所在，粗糙而又多毛的肌肉，似乎要脫穎而出：滿頰黃硬的鬍子，映着骨碌碌滾轉的碧眼，多麼怕人。他見了人走過，先向您行了一個舉手禮，然後操懷着不純粹的華語說道，「先生，一個銅板謝謝」！這位仁兄便是上海人人知道的羅朱阿大，也稱做羅宋癟三。我不是一個像念佛婆一般的消極慈善家，對於乞丐的施捨，日常是不大情願；惟獨一見了這位異國的流人，總不免多少給予些，因此他認定我是他的老主顧，每次見了我，裝着笑臉，行着敬禮，靜待我那銅子拋入那破敝的呢帽中。</p>
<p>有一天又碰見了他，恰巧身邊沒有銅子，便掏了一個小銀元給他，並且叮囑他說：「這個月內，我不再給你了」。他點了點頭，果眞有好幾個禮拜，見了我走過，從不伸過手。</p>
<p>再有一天的黃昏，我走過八字橋。那邊有很多房屋，給炮火轟燬而沒有起造；斷壁殘垣，上邊支了一些鉛皮，便成了那乞丐的安樂窩。我見那羅宋阿大也高坐在裏邊，把日間所得的收穫，成把的掏出來，吩咐那小乞兒去沾燒酒，買小菜，好像請客的樣子。而還有許多的中國乞丐，也掏出香姻尾兒，請他抽吸，一副親熟的態度，倒也鏟除了種族和國家的成見咧！</p>

<p>第十一回　夜話凄凉生涯原是夢履痕零亂風雨太欺八</p>
<p>賈多才聽他的話，也是咐出了神，這時，喝着茶，才把意識恢復過來。桌上的那盞煤油燈，大　是放得煤油燈芯短，不能盡量的吸出油來，因之光燄也不大，昏沉沉地，人影子都隨着有些糢糊。尤其是那慘厲的風聲，又在墻外吹括起來了，更增加了人心上一種不快。他默然着，楊浣花更是默然着。直待賈多才把那杯茶喝完了，浣花才向他道：賈先生，你想想罷，我過的什麽日子，想到別人的下塲，那裏又敢把這日子過了下云？嫁人巡句話，我不敢說了，有誰回南去，短人伺候的，我可以伺候他到江南去。到了江南，我一個工錢也不要別人開銷，願意自己回家去。賈多才聽他所說的條件是這樣的低矮，倒越是顯着他爲人可憐。於是向他道：你所說的這個機會，倒也不怎樣的難，我和你留心罷，浣花道：我也很知道，像我這樣的人，賈先生是看不上眼的。自己說着，也就跟着紅了臉。賈多才用手搔搔頭髮笑道·你這話太客氣。你想想我們也不能乘人於危人好在……好在，我們……他實在不能找出一句相當的話來繼績下去了，就只管搔着自己的頭髮。楊浣花繃着臉，接上父笑道：我也不是那樣糊塗的人，這話我也不好意思跟了向下說我知道，賈先生是很喜歡甘肅來的那位姑娘。我沒有什麽可以巴結你的，明天我去租你作個現成的媒人。本來女人的心事，也只有女人能知道，我照着他們心眼裏的話說上兩句，或者容易成功些。沒有別的可說，將來喝過你的喜酒以後，我伺候你這位新太太回南罷。（二七一）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>論到那些絲上所染的顏色，又是値得太后誇口的！伊不但把天下所有的各種顏色全用到了：而且每一種的顏色，由深而淺，還得分爲好幾十種。譬如像「綠」的一種領色，第一絞便染成墨綠色，以下逐漸减淡，由草緣，嫩綠，湖綠，以至於最淡；這最淡的一絞巳是淡得像白色一樣了。這項工程，說起來好像是並不很難的·但實際上都却是極不容易，那些女孩子們都用了全副的精神在從事着的。然而到了晒出來的時候，數十百種的顏色聚在一起，給那明麗的陽光一照，端的是好看到了極點。如其多看一會，人的眼睛保管會眩昏的！</p>
<p>我第一次隨着太后去參觀的情形，至今還記得很淸楚。</p>
<p>那石坪裏照例晒着幾十桿染好的絲，太后先大略把它們看了一看；接着就走向一桿藍顏色的絲邊去，從最深的一絞起始，很注意地漸次看過去。這時候，那些女孩子們已早就在地上跪着了，肅靜無聲的等候伊老人家發話。因爲伊往往要批評伊們怎樣染法不好，怎樣晒法不好；或者還要發表伊自己對於改進染絲方法的意見。當然，伊口頭上所發表的意見是和繕寫就的聖旨同樣不可遠抗的；雖然染絲是小事，但在這些製絲的藝工們看來，眞是再大不過的大事了。（二八二）</p>

<p>上星期六的下半天，鄭小秋君忽然高興，約作閘北之行，　事了他的車子一同到宋公園路指江廟一帶去，留春金魚園約　君，正回到了無錫去，沒有碰見，一位居住在園巾的何君，却給我們遇到了。何着爲魚迷之甚者，因爲家中的魚無論養得如何高妙，究竟空氣，陽光，及不來留春園，他同莊君又是志同道合的，齊巧地主有新屋之建，他就遷居於此，晨夕和萬千錦鱗相接，吟笑其問，我知其中心之愉快，恐有南面不易之槪吧。</p>
<p>何君導游留春一匝，規模設備，爲全滬冠，小秋選購望天與五花各四尾，給値滿意而去。旋至馬姓魚塲，塲主北人，對於球魚及粗種，飼飬頗有可觀，他如細種的珍珠，水泡眼，翻顋等，不甚講究，南北風氣異宜，水土魚性，亦各不同，所以藝魚人也成爲各有專長了。去馬姓不到百步，尚有武俠明星查瑞龍君自營之一魚園，設施尚佳，奈用人不善，坍敗不堪，即魚亦已無多，聞查君犧牲數千金云。</p>
<p>在歸途中。走未三百步，何君復指觀某新魚園，正在掘地作池，翻土安缸等工作，不消二個月，就可看到許多活潑的魚兒爭逐綠藻問了。</p>
<p>在歡送周胡出國的招商局碼頭上，同紫羅蘭　主人把晤了，談談談到了金魚，他告訴我，在今年的正月裏，有幾尾五六年的紫蘭花魚，因爲多時的天雨，身上起了寒腐，（注後）把它陳在面盆中，就日光照射，偶一疏忽，竟被隣家狸奴去膏了饞吻，像這樣五六年的紫蘭花魚，別說蘇地少有，就是他處一時也不易見到，很代主人扼腕呢。</p>
<p>與張夢周先生不見將半年，其斜土路之鱗社魚園，亦久未一履斯土，小秋約往參觀，乃驅車而去，竹籬整齊，新屋已成，南向三間，窗明几淨，缸池規劃有條不紊，一較年前的篳路　褸，已判若兩處，回想余爲魚樂國創辦事，數月奔走，幾許經營，卒以意見不洽，讓歸某君而去，則張先生的辛苦設置，可以想見，魚而有知，必將繁殖新種，以舞先生了，一笑。</p>
<p>舍弟保之，近亦有愛魚癖，在庭除中安缸二十餘，其種子約已集有十餘種，另　一花匠換水，飼餋工作，晨必親自動手，去年的夏季裏。顋化小魚近萬，適逢天早，井水爲　，因之取水很難，死亡相繼，迨甘霖下沛，所餘少許小魚，發育已不甚長大，余歲底旅里，見有翻顋堆玉虎頭等種，則尚有可觀呢。</p>
<p>（注）寒腐爲魚之周身，發現小白點，顋尼均有，其甚者變爲白塊，致病之由，陰　日久，少受陽光，此病立現，此病除之之法，祇有使受强烈日光照射，明星公司置景主任董天涯先生前年會利用科學治療，用五千枝燭光電燈照射，魚病居然獲痊，惟照射時須格外當心，尤須注意水中溫度。</p>

<p>— 另境</p>
<p>墨翟替當時的士大夫階級起一個綽號，呌「別士」。「別土」是對他自稱的「兼士」而言的，他解說兼與別的分別說：</p>
<p>「順天之意者，兼也；反天之意者，別也。兼之爲道也，義正；別之爲道也，力正。」</p>
<p>但何謂順天，何謂反天？他是並沒有解說出來，大槪古人總歡喜說「天意」，天意如斯，無復何言！不過這樣就很容易流入宿命觀，墨翟尚非宿命論者，他之說順天自然就是指義正爲道的，若以力正爲道就是反天。從這裏可知墨翟是並不一味擁護旣成事實的，要是這旣成事實是從力正以來，他還是要和他一「別」的。</p>
<p>可是這裏就有個問題出來了：我們要是分析眼前事實呢，自可一目瞭然於他究是義正的與否；要是不是我們親眼目覩的，而是上一輩上兩輩手裏的事悄，或甚至於是千百年前的事悄，那我們怎麽能去鑑別他義正與否呢？事實告訴我們，現在的所謂歷史，往往都不是什麽義正的歷史，而義正的歷史往往被後來的史臣一筆抹去了，爲什麽，因爲義正的歷史往往對這旣成事實是不利的居多。等到經過史臣的筆頭一扭，彷彿力正的到是「順天之意」的，而義正的却反趣爲「反天之意」了。後人不察，往往淆亂黑白，我們就無從分別究竟誰是兼士誰是別士了。</p>
<p>因此我們現在讀歷史，就不能專去依靠這些力正的材料，而那些野史筆記說部也不可忽略，他方面「掘地」自然也是一種賓貴的來源。</p>

<p>「按劇中有淸江浦，沛乃明永樂十年，平江伯陳暄所開。又云都御史金圭巡撫汀南，「都御史」及「巡撫」，亦皆明時官制。此蓋永，宣以後人所作，託名元人者。</p>
<p>這兩個證據都很强有力。雖說元曲選中賓白，儘多非元人之舊，而有後來加入的嫌疑，然而我們却沒有理由證　牠的曾經竄動過。所以，這曲選最末的一種雜劇，馮玉蘭夜月泣江舟，不得不算牠是明人所作，傳世元曲總數，又減少一種了。元曲選中無名氏作品，除馮玉蘭外，尚有二十二種，或者還有明人所作，類此者未經老出，正不可知耳？</p>
<p>（二）旗亭記</p>
<p>王之渙旗亭書壁的故事，在元及明初，似並未爲戲曲家所注意，到了明末淸初，才成爲戲曲家愛用的題材。據現在所知道巳著錄的，雜劇有：張龍文旗亭燕，裘璉旗亭館（淸人雜劇初集）傳奇有鄭之文，盧見曾及金椒（？）三本，均名旗亭記。鄭之文的一本，流傳甚少，鄭西諦氏有得收藏，（見佝　集中國戲曲史姿料的新損失與新發見）盧金二本，則頗有一點問題，足資研究。蓋現在並不難得的一本旗亭記，就是以歌伎名叫謝變髮的，屬盧？屬金？似並無定論。而金椒根本則且無其人。這本旗亭記上，有一篇乾隆已卯（一七五九）山東傖父的序。序云：</p>
<p>「揚州繁華甲天下，」竹西」歌吹之盛，自唐以至於今，梨園之多各部，宜矣。顧人情厭故，得坊問一新劇本，則爭相購演，以改時下操觚，多出射利之徒。導淫者旣流蕩而忘返，述怪者又荒誕而不經，愚夫愚婦及小兒女輩，且艷稱之，將流而爲人心風俗之害，心甚非之，而無以易也。全椒蘭　生，矜尚風雅，假館道州，問詩於余。分韻之餘，論及唐集異記旗亭盡壁一事，謂：古今來貞寄俫烈，逸於正史，而收之說部者，不一而足，類皆譜入傳奇。「雙　信可兒，能令吾黨生色，被之管絃，當不失雅奏，而惜乎元明以來詞人，均未之及也。蘭　唯唯，去經年，復遊於揚，出所爲旗亭記全本於　中。余愛其詞之淸雋。而病其頭緒之繁，按以宮商，亦有未盡協者，乃欵之於西園，與共商略，又引梨園老教師，爲點板排塲，稍變易其機軸，俾兼宜於俗雅，閒出醉筆，揮酒胸臆，雖素不谙工尺，而意到筆隨，自然合拍，亦有不自解其故者。記成，沈長洲先生適至，爲奏終曲，先生嘉賞之，曰：是導淫述怪兩家對症之良藥也，題六絕句於册，而勸授梓焉。」</p>
<p>沈歸愚的六首題詞，也還在着。又有寗都盧端臣的跋。這篇序，是一個很重要的記述，靠牠可以解釋道盧金二本之　的。我們知道盧見曾是兩淮的運使，駐在揚州，德州人，所以這山東傖父，無疑的是他的別署。而遺本傳奇的原著作人全椒蘭　生，大約是他的幕客。因爲有他參酌校訂，（就序中的語氣看來，說是改作甚至合作都可以。）更由他付之劑　，書中又卡正式署作者的名字，後來便認爲確是他的著作，和玉尺樓列在一起。玉尺樓恐怕也非盧氏自作，係朱公放（奔）手筆，見秋鐙叢話，蔣瑞藻小說考證引。盧氏當時主持東南風雅，斟刻說得不好是攘奪）幾種曲子，附庸戲曲作家，原是文人常事。沈氏題辭就有，「官閣填詞韻最淸」的話。歷來拿這本傳奇作爲盧氏作品，可算還沒有什麼錯誤。而從來相沿的笑話，則顯然均以全椒蘭　生誤爲令椒字蘭舉，一字之訛，遂又多添出一本金氏旗亭記來。自李調元雨村曲話，王國維曲錄，吳梅中國戲曲概論以下，研綸戲曲的文字，大都承襲着遭訛謬，不曾有人加以訂正，豈王，吳諸氏，乃皆未見及此旗亭記耶？</p>
<p>在上海中國書店第十四卷新舊書目上，有旗亭肥二卷，乾降寫刊，署全椒吳　作，大約是與上述同一的本子，不會另是一種。而我所兒旗亭肥數部，恰均無牽涉到吳　的字樣，不知書店果何所據？或又因全椒藉貢雷同，蘭舉主別號類似，遂率爾註此，亦未可定？不過，　山尊生於一七五五年，（乾隆丙子）山東傖父和蘭　生的施亭記寫成時，他才五歲。題辭的沈歸愚死於一七穴九年，（乾隆已丑）吳　也不過才十五歲。似决無著　書之可能！除非　委實別有一旗亭記，與此書并非一個本子，方無時間上之矛盾也。（未完）</p>

<p>— 欽文</p>
<p>小脚豆也叫做雞肫豆，因爲是腰圓形的，沿豆嘴起着許多皺紋，好像是鷄肫。由一種毛豆做成功；煮的時候加上鹽，所以淡靑色的皮上而，有着白白的鹽花。咀嚼起來韌結結，味道鹹而鮮，帶着一股香氣。叫做小腳豆，是因爲用富陽草紙包著出　，尖尖的一包一包，彷彿一雙隻舊式女子的小脚。</p>
<p>小脚豆在我的家鄉，猶如魯迅先生在孔乙己上所寫的茴香豆，是下酒物的一種。可是比茴香豆來得醒目，尖角小包一層一層的高疊在盤子裏，不但喝酒的人看着要眼熱，也是很能够引出小孩干的口液來的。</p>
<p>幼小的時候，我也常常買得小脚豆來喫。當時只須一文錢一包，一個銅元可以買到十包。平常一個銅元總要分作三四回買得喫，就是先買三四包，找進六七文制錢；再三四包的買幾回。但也有貿了整個銅元的時候，把衣袋裝得滿滿的。</p>
<p>傍午傍晚從學校裏放學回家的時候，肚子早已空虛，在路上買得小脚豆來喫，味道是最好的了。可是進學校去時先在路上買得，藏在衣袋裏，等到上踝上得肚子餓了的時候，暗　的打開草紙包，一顆一顆的摸得放進嘴巴裏，也是別有一種滋味的。</p>
<p>從我家到學校裏去，要經過一條長　堂，叫做橋衖。橋衖中間有着一爿酒店，也出賣小脚豆。我喫的小脚豆，就是總從　酒店裏賈得的。進酒店的生人是父子兩個：一個老頭子和一個中年男子。大家都叫做「阿籣的酒店」，却不知道是指老頭子，還是中年男子：也不知道阿蘭的蘭字，究竟是不是遵樣寫的。但我從離開家鄉以後，常常因爲偶然回憶起兒童時代的生活情形來，聯想到阿蘭酒店的小脚豆：有時也從小脚豆，聯想到兒童時代的種種生活悄形。更其是在抗州的幾年，因爲不時的碰到阿蘭酒店裏的小孩子，—經長成了靑年，是個尖下巴的瘦白臉；如果阿蘭原指那時的老頭子，那來他是阿蘭的孫子了；—也就不時的聯想到小脚豆。</p>
<p>近來我愈是覺得生活困難，愈加容易想起小脚豆來；—在我的生命史上，喫小脚豆的幾年，委實可算是「黃金時代」了。道次回到家鄉去，早就預期，很想重行喫喫小脚豆，溫習一回兒童時代的生活趣味。雖然阿蘭的酒店依然開在那裏，也仍然有尖角包的小脚豆高疊在盤中；可是到了家裏，各種衰落的惰形，把我這個念頭，於無形中打得煙消雲散了，其實，即使硬的貿得小脚豆來，也不會得到當年的情趣，因爲再也不能到學校的課堂裏去，顆一顆的晤摸得喫。以爲這種滋味，在我雖然「此生巳休」，正當兒童時代的侄　，總得好好的享受；但照三弟說，因爲年成不好，捐稅又重，家鄉的學校，還在停辦中。佳輩述贖書的地方都沒有，那樣喫小脚豆的滋味，也是無從說起的了。</p>

<p>— 仃</p>
<p>像這樣的事情並不是希罕的，在書本里，在朋友的閒談胡扯中，在許許多多的塲合里我是常見常聞的。然而一到自己親臨其境的時候，那就不然了。</p>
<p>事情是這樣的：有一天晚上，當我路過大世界門口時，突然被一個女人攔住，歇得期利地喊道：「英哥，英哥！　唷……您到那兒？妹妺許久沒有遇着您了。」</p>
<p>我抬頭一瞧，看見一副蒼白的面龐，充溢着一種人生的苦惱與不幸！在她的眼里默默地含着難忍之悲哀的淚水，呆呆地凝視着我。我也呆呆地端詳了她一回，在記憶中，彷彿見過這樣的一個女人。然而雖然經過强力的想索之後，仍舊不能記起她到底是誰哩？</p>
<p>「忘了嗎？英哥！是的……是的，你不會把像我這樣的一個人放在心頭的，　唷……英哥。你應該記得我呵，難道你眞的完全不記得我嗎？」她緊緊地貼近在我的身邊，顫動地。我瞧兒她的胸膛上下卜卜的跳着。</p>
<p>「啊……眞的，對不住，我忘了。你是誰？告訴我。」</p>
<p>「朱貴芳……你的同學，五年前的好朋友。」她直截地。</p>
<p>「㗒……你……你是朱貴芳嗎？你……眞的是……朱實芳嗎？不……要騙我！」我突然被那種意外的事所徨惑了。</p>
<p>這時，站在我們四週的閒人，用一種希奇的限光照瞧我們，甚至也有哈哈地大笑起來了。</p>
<p>我的臉上好像被火烤過那般的，心也凌亂起來了。</p>
<p>她於是一邊拖着我，一邊說道：</p>
<p>「英哥，到我家里去再說。這兒人多，不方便，你又怕難爲情啦！」她不像先前那樣的悽愴的。當她用着那種溫存的口氣對我說出這樣的話時，在她那笑的愛媚下，我確實已經記起她以前那種態度了。</p>
<p>「唉！貴芳……」我太息了一下，心深好比被白刃刺進般的。</p>
<p>「不要耽心，英哥！祗要你……能够……能够記得我……我這樣的一個人呵……我就……就感激您了。」</p>
<p>「人生眞是千變萬化啊！」我感歡地說。</p>
<p>她瞧瞧我，一種不幸的悲哀重復籠罩着她的面龐。我再不說什麽了。免得使她難過。於是我們默默地走着。她緊緊的握着我的手，緊緊的貼在我的身邊。</p>
<p>「到了。英哥。這就我的家啊……」站着，在弄堂里，她說。</p>
<p>「這是你的家？」我疑問地。瞧一瞧門口懸着一只電燈，白的磁罩寫上紅的油字：「桂芬」</p>
<p>深深地太息了一下，我跟她到她的房里去了。</p>
<p>「請坐，英哥。我對你說。你狠奇怪吧？自然的，你怎也想不到的，貴芳會流落到這地步！」</p>
<p>「這是怎樣一回事？唉！……」</p>
<p>「沒別的。英哥，這也不是我願意的。誰願意呢？不過……實在是迫不得已的！一個人，尤其是一個沒有倚靠的女人，沒有父親的女人，沒有上進的機會的女人，沒有點兒錢來養活六七十歲母親的女人，像我這樣的！除了設法找點兒錢之外，還有什麽其他的路可跑呢？我要生活，我的母親要生活，我的弟弟妹妹要生活，我的負担很重，我的責任很大，我不能不設法生活，什麼職員，丫頭，女工我都幹過的。英哥，我的家境你是知道的，我個人的性格，行爲你也明瞭的，你不是曾經對我說過嗎？……「貴芳……你是一個能幹的人，聰明，耐勞，人品又好，將來是不可限量的，你是一個很出色，很有希望的女性啊……」然而，英哥啊！那番話祇有使我憤恨，傷心。人完全受環境支配的，像我這樣一個脆弱的女子。在這四五年間，什麽折磨，辛酸……都受够了。我這世人也算了。可是，英哥，你要體諒我，明白我，爲我向人間，社會，及我們一切相識的朋友中，替我說一說，替我解釋一下：我的遭境，不幸，特別是使我這樣的一種罪惡呵！</p>
<p>於是她咽嗚起來了。</p>

<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>巨卿先生爲了應付這些難關，蒙館裏的課本也不得不酌量改變，那些綫裝石印的商業應用尺牘，甚至洋裝的猫跳狗呌一，朗誦起來怪不順口的白話教科書，這時都進了門，和幼學，孟子等等作伴了。作着這樣的事情，巨卿先生就如想造貞節牌坊的孀婦失了節一樣難過。白話文原是他一向所睡棄的，何况他在鎮上許多塾師中間鶴立鷄群的優越地位，唯一値得驕傲處就是他會敎「子曰「「詩云」的「經書」呢！</p>
<p>然而一切都無法挽回。就如今年正月裏開書房的日期，他也只得隨波逐流地破例提早了。　因爲要開書房，事前就緊張忙碌了好幾天。平素在街上不大看得見的巨卿師母，也瞇緊了一雙老花兼近視眼睛，脚小零丁地拐着身子，蹣蹣跚跚遍街走，這家那家地通知上學的學生。巨卿先生自己，更像上前綫衝鋒的戰士，戰戰兢兢地，吃飯睡覺都惦記着開書房這僅事。他想憑着自己的努力，挽回一點目前的厄運。</p>
<p>那天巨卿先生在街上遇見了學生唐家祿的父親唐大叔，一個在鎮上境况很不壞的自耕農。。打量着店大叔身邊的一個七八歲小孩子，巨卿先生的三角臉上掙扎出一點笑容，和他攀談起來：</p>
<p>「這是令郎，幾歲了？」摸着孩子的和尚頭。</p>
<p>「開年七歲，先生。」恭敬地回答。</p>
<p>「哦，很乖！」</p>
<p>連連點着頭，似乎由衷地稱許；心裏却在考量着怎麼把自己說話的主得體地提出來，　躇了好一回，終於說。：「可以送他上學了，唐大叔」，說完話，深陷的眼睛死死地盯過去，等待着答復。</p>
<p>唐大叔笑着，笑得很苦。</p>
<p>「是呀，先生，照年紀是應該上學了。可是「水口」（註）聚，過日子爲難，我們種田的一年收成，除了納稅完糧，吃的都不够，小孩子讀書的事祇好　于擱了。去年區公所裏又加了教育捐，說是學堂裏做經費的，又是種田人家孩子讀書，還不是要「着錢」（註）嗎！</p>
<p>聽唐大叔訴着苦巨卿先生的心冷了半截。，望望他的紫　色臉上擠起大一堆縐紋，那似笑非笑的來的尷尬表情，却像還有許多苦楚沒訴盡。——他接着說：</p>
<p>「先生！這兩天本來我也想到你府上去。昨天先生娘到我家來通知開書房，我不在家，沒有告訴她……（停了停）這幾年，我們家祿多礦先生嚴緊，教的好，應該好好的多讀幾年，找個好生意。可是家裏人手少，倔長工開消大，吃口又重，所以……所以，今年我們家祿祇好丟書包了，留在家裏也好上畋替手脚。』</p>
<p>每個字都震動着巨卿先生的耳膜，嗡嗡地好比打天雷。人是楞着，沒開口，就差點兒身體沒有倒下去。</p>
<p>（註）「水口」就是「時勢」「書錢」就是「學費」。</p>

<h3 id="c237">英俄談話與中國 <a href="#c237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— 李敏</p>
<p>西方一個帝國主義的領袖大英帝國，一個社會主義的國家蘇聯，最近在莫斯科雙方代表開始兩國間的交涉了。這是一個很重要的國際事件。英國在西方是最老的帝國，而蘇聯則又是西方一個適立於和英國絕對相反地的另一種政體國家。這兩個國家，在國際政治上，向來是立於水火不相容的境地的，而現在則竟開始携手談話了。這是一個多麼有趣的事啊。</p>
<p>然而這也並不足奇，英國雖是西方一個老大帝國，一向反對蘇聯，但最近，因德國之崛起，自動重整軍備，英國也有不能控制這個紛亂的歐洲局面之勢，而一方，俄國在歐洲的勢力，却在日增月盛，旣和怯國和好，又與各小國聯絡，遠在美洲的美國，去年又已和蘇聯恢復國交了。在這形勢下，沒奈何，大英帝國爲要保持他在歐洲的覇權，只有回頭來和這如歐洲能的怪國家親近一下，這才是最近英國所以願意派代表到莫斯科去和俄國談話的一個大原因。俄國正需要各國和他和好，不去進攻，對於英國的惠然肯來，自然親迎之不暇了。</p>
<p>世界局勢，眞是翻雲覆雨，變化莫测。當歐戰後幾年問—到現在更是如此，各國莫不十分憎惡着這革命後的俄國的，然而，不到十年，自從前二三年起，各國又反轉來和俄國親近了。這很夠我國玩味。自然，這其間的原因，就是因爲一則昔日的弱國，現在變成强國，一則時勢造成，有舉足輕重之勢，因之，主義絕不相同的國家，亦有同舟共濟的趨勢，這樣看來，國際問，也無非講究利害關係而已。</p>
<p>最可注意的，是中國問題。據報上說，這次英俄談話，恐要觸及中國領土的完整問題。不知他們對這問題的意見怎樣，怎樣來討論？我這時未便加以預测，總之這也是他們的利害决不是我國利害也。</p>

<p>孔子離開葉國要回到蔡國去，在路上，只見田裏長沮與桀溺兩個人在並耕着田，孔子大奇，心想道：「這兩人大槪是隱士吧」。恰巧走在前頭的弟子跑回來說，「前面有兩條大路，不知道到蔡國是那一條路對的，請問老師，從左走呢，從右走呢」？孔子並不知道，心想，「這怎麽辦呢」？吩咐子路道，「仲由，你去問那田裏的人吧」。子路領命而去，到了田埂上站住，恭敬地對長沮桀溺問道，「請問一聲，咱們要到蔡國去，前面有兩條路，不知是從左走的，還是從右走的」？長沮桀溺聽罷停住耕田，長沮望了子路一眼道，「坐在車上的是那一個呢」？子路道，「孔丘先生。又問道，「是魯國的孔丘嗎」？子路點頭道，「是的不錯」。長沮哈哈大笑道，「旣然是他，那是認得路的了」。桀溺問道，「你是那一個」？子路道，「咱姓伸名由的便是。端詳了一回又道，「你是孔丘的弟子嗎？子路點頭道，「是的，已經大不高興了，那桀溺輕蔑地說這，「醉生夢死的人，眞是多呵！可是那一個是救主？…而且與其跟着學政治的人，還不如跟着不談政治的好呢」？說罷不理子路，兩人又耕起田來。子路站在那裏，心想這兩人眞是無禮得很，人家誠意地向你問路，說了一番間話之後，還要譏誚咱！你不告訴咱的路也吧，爲什麼要譏誚咱吧，混蛋東西，揍你」！孔子遠遠地望見長沮桀溺不理子路，而子路站在田埂上在磨拳擦掌大有動武之勢，急呌一個弟子跑去拉子路回來。孔子縐着眉尖問道，「仲由，怎麽啦」？子路將剛才合長沮桀溺的對話，一五一十地說給孔子聽，孔子嘆氣道，「人怎麽可以合禽獸在一道呢？天下如果太平，我便不談政治了」。</p>
<p>又一天，子路落在後頭，心急得很，不知孔子的馬車跑到那裏去了，在路邊遇着一個老頭子，他拉住問道，「你看見老師嗎」？那老頭子望了子路一下，知道他是孔丘的弟子，冷笑道，「四體不勤，五穀不分，他怎麽配做老師呢？」說着將手棍子挿在田埂上，下了田牽牛犂起泥巴來，並不理他。子路沒法，只得自己找路，不料走了不遠，抹了個灣，孔子的馬車就停在前頭的大樹下在休息着，　起腿兒放開大步趕上去，就將剛才所遇的老領子的話告訴了孔子，說道，「那老頭眞可惡，他在罵老師呢」。孔子低眉想了一回道，「那是隱士啦！說得還對」。子路心想回去問他一些學問亦是很有益的，而且他旣然敢說咱們老師不配做老師，那他一定是比較咱們老師有學問得多的了。亦不管孔子高興不高興，回轉了身就跑。可是抹了個灣，跑了許多路，急得一身大汗，抬頭一望，那老頭子却不在田裏犂田，不知道到那裏去了。</p>

<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>我是一個高小的畢業生，因爲經濟的困雖，而棄學就商，從此以後，我便失去求學的機會了。可是因爲學識的根基太淺簿了，對於一切的東西，都不能得到充分的明瞭，尤其是自然科學，更覺得糢糊極了。譬如，我常常在報上看見許多關於什麽「石油」的話，我覺得懷疑。我想這石油是什麼東西呢？是汽油嗎？是煤油嗎？是別的什麼油類嗎？。</p>
<p>關於這個問題，我曾問過根多的朋友，可是他們也對於它也不大明瞭，祇告訴我，它是一種由礦質提煉而來的油類，是否和汽油同類，也不知道。</p>
<p>這個人有一個很討人厭的習慣，就是遇到一個問題，必定要追問到水落石出才止。別的人旣然不能滿足我的求學慾，於是不得不來麻煩先生了，我想先生對於它一定能給我一個明確的解說吧？但是你討厭我嗎？敬請</p>
<p>撰安　　常峙龍敬上</p>
<p>編者按：常君的「打破沙鍋問（紋）到底」的習慣，並不是什麽「壞」的習慣，這是一個對於求學很有帮助的習慣。現在有許多人對於某一種事，雖不了解，可是他却又不肯去問別人，因爲怕人家笑他。這是一種多麽錯誤的心理啊！因爲一個人無論如何是絕不能明暸世界上所有的東西，每一個人當然都有他自己所不知道的東西。所以，把自己不知道的問題去問人，並不是什麽羞恥，這實在是一種極好的習慣，我希望一般人都應該具有這種「問一的態度，我想從別人口中所得到的知識，也許比看書所得的知識寳貴得多。</p>
<p>石油總稱石腦油，俗稱煤油，是一種黃色或褐色的液體，略爲透明，有莫</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>氣，含有揮發性甚强，容易着火。在雷燈未發明以前，常用石油點燈。現在石油除了點燈以外還有其他非常重要的用途。它可以運轉石油動力機關和氣體動力機關，供船，車，飛機，和種種工業上的使用。而飛機，潛水艇等作戰利器，更需要着巨量的石腦油，所以它在軍事上的位置是非常重要，在這第二次大戰有爆發的危機的時候，石油的爭奪便成爲各國的重要政策。所謂「石油戰」卽指此而言。日本佔據我們的東省，也就是因爲在那裏有豐富石腦油，鐵等等礦產，可以供給她作戰的原料。</p>
<p>石腦油多藏在於新舊水成岩之中，或由泥灰山（噴出泥土之火山）等處湧出，並有和碳氫化合物之氣體相伴而迸出於火山口的。至於石腦油的成因，有人說是由地球內部的無機溶液而成的，有的又說是由陸生植物而來者，近來有人說石腦油是由有機物的脂肪質，在比較的低溫度之下，經過長時間的分解而成的。這似乎是比較可信的解說。</p>
<p>石腦油的礦質燃性過高，不適於燈火之用。普通都是利用它的含有特發揮力，而用蒸餾法分離之。其法是把那些由地下汲出的原油，（那是還有許多有黏　性帶黑色的東西混和着。）放入蒸儲器中加熱，容易蒸發的部分最初成爲蒸氣而出，將這蒸氣冷却凝集起來，便成揮發油，供自動車，飛機，潛水艇，等機關燃料的使用。此卽普通之所謂汽油。其次溫度略高一點蒸發的呌做燈汕，也就時普通所說的煤油，用在石油燈和石油發動機的都是這種石油。溫度更高蒸水的呌做機械油，以塗車軸使它廻轉圓滑。其次所得的是礦脂，不是固體，不是液，是原油中的黏貳的東西，用以塗金屬的表明，以防生銹。其次是作蠟燭的石蠟。最後所剩下的是油滓，呌做土瀝靑用，以柴道沙等等之用。</p>
<p>石蠟油產地，根據已經發現的估計，以美俄兩國最多，約佔全世界十分之九。中國的石蠟油礦的產額，還沒有正確的估計，大約也很豐富，其產地多在新疆，川陝等地，已經開採的油井，已有十餘處，但它的開採權却大半操在外商之手，利權外溢，實在是我們應該注意一件的事。</p>

<p>— 紉琴</p>
<p>海倫漢斯（HelenHayes）的名字，似乎可以用不着介紹的了。我現在所要介紹的，是她的愛女，曼莉。曼莉現在祇有五歲，還不懂得她自己是個有福氣的人，做了一位大明星的女兒，終日嬉戲的享樂。她像一個荷蘭洋囡囡，肩上垂着兩條像蜂蜜一樣黃澄澄的髮辮。她的小嘴是紅紅的，預料將來一定要勾動多少靑年的心弦哩。</p>
<p>海倫漢斯是一位半在舞台半在銀幕的大明星，但却因爲她自己是從小演戲，沒有享受過什麽小孩子應當享樂的家庭安樂，所以到現在，他對於家庭，就更比別人重視。她對於她的曼莉的愛情，亦就不言而喻。海倫漢斯的身體，不是屬於如自己的。它是屬於廣大的觀眾，她的丈夫，她的母親，但是最大的部份，却是屬於她的愛女曼莉的。</p>
<p>有一次，一位新聞記者去訪問海愉，她却無意之中遇到了曼莉，使她的訪問，得到了非常之收獲。曼莉從外面奔了進來，身上是一身的泥水。她進了屋子！就坐在屋子的中間地板上，開始自己脫鞋襪。一隻狗跑了過來，伸着長長的舌頭舐着她的臉，鼻子，和耳朶，表示她對於小主人的歡迎。就在這個時候，曼莉開始呢喃的說話了。她說：「這是我買了過聖誔的，因爲我的邁可兒已經沒有了。他喜歡舐我的臉，使我要多洗幾回，我說的是多洗幾回臉，因爲你知道，狗舐過之後，臉上有狗氣味的。你說不洗興嗎？」這長長的小演說，使她氣都透不過來的。她於是祇好自己笑了一笑，露出她兩個笑渦出來。這不是那記者意外的收獲嗎？</p>
<p>這個时候，海倫已經走了進來。她那種年輕美麗，居然已經是一位一婦箴」‘WhatEver</p>
<p>讀者注意，海倫漢斯的表演生活，從五歲京開始的。她說：「我的入戲劇界，和現在蕭麗鄧的　電影界相彷佛的。我的母親將我送到跳舞學校，呌我得到些好的姿態，以及有一個向內　的足趾，醫生說跳舞可以將它糾正的。就在那學校每季公開表演的時候，那是租了一家戲院舉行的，被一位戲劇界的钜頭看見了。那就是我戲劇生活的開始。那時我才五歲，正是曼莉現在的年齡。</p>
<p>「曼莉正像我那時一樣大，但是她有沒有表演的傾向，她將來是不是做演員，我完全不放在心上。現在她雖然享樂着湖閑的生活，但或者她不能得到我以前所經過的一切樂趣，亦或者她的生活沒有我那樣的周全。但是我卻不願意看見了命運之神，將曼莉指給她看。我靜待着自然的支配而已。</p>
<p>「我自己是從小就奔走於四方，好像利話中所說，是在箱子裏長的。據兒童心理學家的說法，小孩子應當時時使他變換地方，使他能活潑，隨機應變，得到新朋友，使他能獨立，不依賴他人，不怕難。這或者是對的。但是我或者是老派些，因為我對於曼莉，想還是使她有一個穩定的生活好些，那亦是我幼時所沒有享到的。</p>
<p>穩定的生活，不錯的，那是海倫漢斯所半生還沒有享受過，而日夜所求着的。她自從五歲起，就屬於大衆，而很少個人享樂過，因爲優伶的生活大概是如此的。因此她又感概的說道：「我很不耐煩的等着那我可以退休的時候，邁進了那個呌做老年的甜蜜時期。我和我的丈夫都是渴望着老年的降臨的。到了那時，却利（海倫的丈夫）令檢出一張可笑的相片來說道：「這張相片，我們掛它起來。曼莉的男朋友看見了會笑死的。到了那時，鷄皮鶴髮老熊婆裟；生煩惱，悉成過去，桑榆晚景，正足珍貴也。」</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c246">評「舞宮情潮」 <a href="#c246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— 鏟非</p>
<p>Rumba—大光明</p>
<p>在一般尋常的歌舞影片之中，這一「舞宮情潮，不能不稱爲是一部特出的作品。</p>
<p>它的內容雖然也不免平淡無奇，只是戀愛料紛的矯揉造作，然而劇作者却是使用了爛熟的電影的表現方法，使男女主人公之間愛惰的波折，構成了曲折離奇的悄節。這在新的觀點上看來，並無特別可取之處，可是對於一般需要娛樂的觀衆們，却可使他們戚覺滿意了。當男女主人公在兌彩票時第一次會面，就小的衛突起來，第二次見面，女主人公本是一片好心，但男主人公却因悞會又衝突起來，甚至於他因此失業。第三次男授女以新舞術，在深夜之中低語溫存，但她因不肯再放肆一點，使他爲之氣忿，甚至於又悞會起來。第四次女至男處，本來是十分熟情的論婚嫁？殊木知男　却存心　　，當甜言蜜語，　會全消時，另　　　來　，（她是　主人公有意約來報復的。）又使他們分開了。以後女主人公消極的回家，男主人公幾次來訪，都不理睬，雖然她的愛與恨是十分衝突和矛盾的。一直到生死存亡的關頭，男女主人公到底在熱情的舞蹈中眞誠相愛了。有了如此波瀾起伏的劇情，便使這平凡的戀愛糾紛也不平凡了。劇作家如此嚴密的結構力量，確是美國戀愛影片最高的表現。</p>
<p>更値得注意的便是導演的技能了。影片一開始，就楚那樣不平凡的，那樣活潑的鏡頭，那樣急速的Tempo，表示人們對於彩票的狂熱。同樣的手法，處理了在古巴鄉問大塲面的Drnmba舞蹈，由單調至繁雜，由緩慢至急速，到最後是極短的CuttoCtu，複雜的混亂的織成狂熱的圖書。更由於熱烈的音樂，帮助了空氣的熱烈與濃厚，這使古巴的熱烈的風習，給與人們極大的興味。</p>
<p>我們得特別提出最後一塲舞台上的Rumba舞。他先用了許多樂器的特寫，音樂隊指揮老的慎重與嚴肅，引起了觀衆對於音樂嚴肅注意。然後慢慢的開幕，那樣美麗國案的佈景，那樣暗淡的燈光，當　　　人拖着　銬痛　呻吟的出塲　　　　　　　南　　　　鳴，幾次的電光閃爍，大風吹着樹葉的顫動。至於兩女一男的舞隊，聯袂登塲，翩韆的舞姿，熱戀的悄懷，和着醉人的音樂，誰也給它迷醉住了。一直到男女主人公擁抱登塲，在危急的心悄中，（因爲擔心着流氓的槍擊）在熱戀的情懷中，成功了精采的一幕，在這種地方，我們當然不會忽視歌舞導演和作曲家的努力，然而對於空氣的構成，却不能不歸功於總的導演。</p>
<p>此外我們還可以舉出幾點，以說明導演的熟練；當男主人公和古巴女郎卡美莉泰會面的時候，導演先以另一少女在和着琴聲歌唱，以描寫當地的風光，然後從五角錢買價値三元的扇子到參加夜舞會，當時的風趣以及他們認識的過程，都是極好的處理。當男女主人公深夜舞蹈的一塲，二人之問的心理描寫，也可謂細膩之極。所以這一影片僅就導演來說，已經給與我們不少好威。</p>
<p>喬其賴甫德以前多飾强個性的人物，可是這裏，他是以精良的舞技，瀟經的姿態而出現了。對於卡洛郎白，我們不會忘懷她在「二十世紀快車」中那樣賣力的演技，她也是適宜扮演强個性的演員。不過我們更歡喜的，乃是在彭赫區的「法網情絲」中曾經露過一面的瑪姑（Margo）她第一次和我們相見的是眞情而憂鬱的少女，她熱戀着一個陰狠的律師，（克勞特萊恩斯—CandeRainde飾，卽「戰地離魂」的主角）當愛人遺棄她的時候，她是願以身殉的。在那一影片中我們便開始對她深切的注意，這因爲她的音調和姿態都是非常特出的。但也覺得她太年輕了一點，對於劇中人的身份似不甚合宜。現在她又以同樣的姿態出現於「舞宮惰潮」中了。雖然在這裏戲並不多，不能給她充分的表現，可是她確能給人認識她有着偉大的前途。</p>
<p>然而這許多優秀的人材齊集於這一片中，却可惜沒有表現一個比較可取的主題，這裏除了奮觀念的描盡了男女戀愛糾紛之外，便是以最大的力量從事形式的誇張。很顯明的，從男主人公身上，正表現劇作者觀念的陳舊。我們並不說他的脫離流氓活的不應當，可是他的力爭上流，進而與富家女郎結合，這正說明紳士觀念的向上爬主義，到底是庸俗的了。</p>

<p>— 培元</p>
<p>談過了學校停辦不停辦的問題之後，話鋒便轉談到劇社組織辦法的問題本身上去，據各人議論的結果，劇社的經費暫由柳榮先行墊出，劇務主任一職，一致公推夢鷗担任，而女主角的一個位置，自然是曼娜担任了。</p>
<p>劇社成立之後，夢鷗曾經要求素秋加入他們的團體，可是素秋以「我見了人家臉就會紅得說不出來話的」一句話堅决的辭却了。</p>
<p>在劇社排練的時候，柳榮見了夢鷗與曼娜那抓親熱的狀態，很醋意的對他手下那位設計的老高（奚良飾）說：「我化了錢讓人家取樂，老高，你太開我的玩笑了」？而我們的老高却態度很鎮靜的回答：「山人自有妙計，你祇照計而行，保險定會水到成渠的」。</p>
<p>經過很多時日的排鍊，「女神」終於正式的在舞台上演出了，曼娜就是飾女神的一個角色，夢鷗飾屈原的一價角色。在正式演出的那一天，柳榮帶來了很多人在台下捧場，喬傑同素秋也蒞臨參觀，另外來丁有不少商科的學生，對於夢鷗的藝術都表示很大的欽佩。</p>
<p>「女神」演完了，柳榮同老高跑到了戲院後台，這時夢娜正在屏風後面卸裝，從屏風的隙處看到曼娜那一雙粗而圓的肉感大腿，是撩動了柳榮的春心，他大膽的伸頭到屏風裏去，但立時又縮了出來。</p>
<p>曼娜換上了平常裝東從屏風後出來，柳榮首先開口說：「我特來敬祝你偉大的成功的」，曼娜等着同答：「一切都是你的力量，我正要謝謝你呢一。柳榮又笑盈盈從衣袋中掬取一只金鋼鑽戒指，套在曼娜的右手指上說：「爲紀念這次的光榮，我特製了這個紀念品，請你批評一下」，曼娜微笑的視着柳榮，表示感謝的樣子，於是就在這一只金鋼鑽戒上的魔力下曼娜是許身於柳榮的了。</p>
<p>南府大學果然因經濟不足停辦了，夢鷗與喬傑同樣的被捲進了失業的潮流裏。</p>
<p>柳榮與曼娜的戀愛已到了成熟的時期而舉行結婚的儀式了，幾年來未嘗一日忘懷曼娜的夢鷗，在接到了柳榮與曼娜的結婚妻帖之後，你想，他是怎樣的悲傷呵！他瘋狂了，痛哭了，憤怒了，以前曼娜給他的照片，全都撕成片片。這時，素秋聞聲跑過來，見了地上零亂撕碎的曼娜照片，結婚的喜帖，她早明白了一切。</p>
<p>曼娜與林榮的結婚，這一個刺激是驚醒了夢鷗幾年來紛紅色的幻夢，於是又轉變了他戀愛的對像，追求近水變台的素秋了，素秋本來是很愛夢鷗的，遂接受了夢鷗的愛，而同居着了，但是他們同居不久，素秋也失業了。並且因爲喬傑依然是在失業中，依賴着夢鷗夫歸過活，使他們的生活，更見窮困起來。</p>
<p>一天，夢鷗又幹着他老工作—寫求助信，素秋忙着燒飯，喬傑却坐在書架旁對着自己畢業證書發牢騷。夢　聽了跑來報着他的肩膀說：「不要性急，我想總有一處有辦法的，素秋亦跑來　蜜　　　　　　　們　　鼓　　　　雜　　　　　　　　盤　　這　　　　：「從』</p>

<h3 id="c248">平民住宅建築時（上） <a href="#c248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— 希浩</p>
<p>……應注意的幾點……</p>
<p>平民住宅的建造，經過了市政府努力的建議，已可尅日興工，這實在足以使每一個平民的生活得到鼓舞和榮幸，最値得我人欣佩的建設，當然，對於這新的建築，我們不希望造得怎樣　麗堂皇，但是，至少我們希望牠們在可能範圍內，務求設備上的周密，就管見所及，下列幾點，在設計這新住宅前，須加以特別的注意。</p>
<p>（一）衛生問題—過去平民往所最缺乏的設備，就是衛生問題，低低的屋子，牆壁上開着不滿一方尺的窗門，陰濕的泥地，和昏暗的四壁，臭氣充塞，簡直不像人類住的屋子，并且沒有厠所的設備，於是屋的四周，時時充滿排洩物，這一切的一切，不僅使居住者的健康損害，抑且影響過路的人，鄰居，甚至整個區域，所以，我們在設計新住宅的當兒，第一最須考盧的，就是衛生的問題，最緊要的，就是通風的問題，窗子的面積，務求適當，使室內的空氣，可以儘量流通，舖地的材料，最好地板或三和土，務求容易掃除或淸潔，厠所的設備，實在是最緊要的，這種厠所，務求便利而容易淸潔，同時，除掉私有的厠所外，應當多設幾個公共的厠所，其地點務求中心。</p>
<p>浴室的設備，對於平民住所上，每一個工程師似乎都忽略過，這實在是大大的錯誤，洗浴實在是衛生上最大的問題。尤其對於一般一天到晚勞力的平民，渾身煤灰的做工回來，如其得到良快的洗操，對於他們的健康上有很大的俾益，尤其當夏令，疫癘的發生，可以减少多多，所以，每一問住宅，應當設有浴室，這種浴室可以非常簡單，例如，只要有一個浴缸，一個自來水龍頭，熱水可以自己供給，不過，浴水的徘洩，必須有很便利的水溝，這一點必須注意。</p>
<p>（二）安全問題—人烟稠密的都市內，最容易遇到的危險，就是火患，過去的平民住宅，因爲昆連的綠故，一過火患，就迅速延燒，無法施救，我們隨時可以看到報紙上記載，每年葬送火窟的平民，其數可觀，考這種起火的原因，大半因用「行灶」或「風爐」煮飯不慎。蓋大半平民生活根艱難，無力砌製灶頭，不得不採用「行灶」等價廉的東西替代，這種東西應用不得法，危險性非常之大，因爲牠們沒有通氣的姻囱啊，所以在新的住宅上，每一家應當預先替他們砌就一灶（鍋灶已足。）</p>
<h3 id="c249">社會生活的變遷與建築樣式 <a href="#c249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— 日本谷口忠作張廣正譯</p>
<p>建築樣式爲時代文化象徵之一，但其受材料的影饗之處亦極多。</p>
<p>建築的原始材料，爲原樣的天然石和天然樹木，因之具有其特別樣式。於埃及，希臘，羅馬等地方，靠了出產的大理石的利用，由是建造優美的大理石建築物；接受建築的藝術，而確定其樣式。這種樣式，爲歐洲建築樣式的主要源流。是謂之石材利用的建築樣式。</p>
<p>反之，如在日本，其地富森林，且有地震國的關係，石造建築不發達，天然木造建築代之而興。日本的建築樣式　，爲木造利用樣式。</p>
<p>不施以特殊的科學處理，而只利用天然木材與石材的樣式，其構造法當然是極簡單的了。</p>
<p>然，自十九世紀淤業革命以來，科學的急激發達，建築材料亦大蒙其影響。就因鐵，水門汀，玻璃等的產生，自來利用天然物的單簡的建築構造樣式，根本爲之一變。由於鐵與水門汀的利用，於是手鋼架構造代替了舊有的盾式構造。</p>
<p>一方而由於力學的研究，合理的力學的設計，被應用於建築構造上，從前石造磚造的龐然過犬的柱，過厚的牆壁，其程度皆被减少，而層數加多。建築物的構浩材料部份占有的空間减少，成爲利用廣大空問的樣式。</p>
<p>而且，利用鐵及水門汀的建築物，還能耐震，耐火，耐風。從前的利用天然石，天然樹木構造的建築樣式，假令其在藝術上是較占優秀；但其實用，則遠不及利用鐵和水門汀的樣式了。</p>
<p>然而，建築若單只合乎實用，仍不滿足，於是粉飾鐵及水門汀的種種材料，紛被科學地研究出來。例如於外觀的美上，有人造大理石；於室內保溫，防音，美觀的材料，則利用纖維質板，石膏板，包鑲木片等。</p>
<p>時至今日，鐵及水門汀的機造旣合實用，又因種種裝飾材料之產生，使之更爲美化。但今後將有更進一層的要求，卽以適合衛生設備如空氣洗滌，煖房，防音，防濕爲目的的材料底研究，是不容再緩的。</p>
<p>這麽一來，一方面，建築物爲人類生活的容器；他方面，利用日日在進步的科學之力，以滿足人類無限的慾求。但建築費，設備費跟着勢將更行增大。隨之而生的結果，是建築物的貧賤富貴之差，益形顯著。這是社會的重要問題，亦不能置諸不顧的。因此，除了對鐵與水門灑汀的宏偉華麗的建築適合的建築材料底研究外；與此相並重的，是在鐵和水門汀以外，謀適合一般人生活的更低廉的具備耐大耐震耐濕目的的新材料之研究，爲今後建築材料的研究上必要之點。不過優秀的建築材料以低廉的價格供給這事，是須要建築樣式統一化。有一定材料的品型，然後由工廠大量生產。在德國，住宅的各部，窗，門等的大小，皆統一於二三種型式中。卽是建築樣式漸次傾向於簡單化。</p>
<p>一定模型的家屋的名部材料，旣由工廠大量產生。於建造房屋時，依圖樣而組立結合乏，這方法是得最低廉而且優美的家屋的捷徑。</p>
<p>爲了這，一般人及建築家們，是應有自覺。爲大家的生價而犧牲們人的慾望，不固執於特殊的建築樣式，而滿足於利用統一的材料的建築樣式中。</p>
<p>若能如是，則優秀的建築將較諾全日低廉得多，且工期的縮短，更爲意中事了。靠了這，則大災地震的損害和盜患等可减少；使日常生活更合乎衛生。那麽，健康及經濟狀况，亦勢將日益增進了。</p>
<p>希望人們能早日理解這點，需要者及建築家們，能滿足於利用統一的材料所得的建築樣式中。</p>

<p>(Kaifeng) The notorious bandit Cui Bangjie was captured. He previously secretly returned to his hometown of Binfeng to gather old cronies and occupy the mountains, attempting to disrupt the public security in western Henan and echo the red bandits in the Sichuan-Shaanxi border area. This was detected by the Yu-Sui Commissioner's Office, which immediately dispatched detectives and informants to arrest him in the mountains near Qingliang Temple on the border of Baofeng and Linru on the evening of the 30th of this month. Cui was cleverly disguised and initially refused to admit his identity, but after the informants identified him, he lowered his head and said nothing. The Baofeng County Government has now requested that he be handed over to Kaifeng for interrogation. (Note: There have also been reports from the Tianjin-Beiping area about the capture of Cui Bangjie.) A reporter inquired with an official of the Yu-Sui Commissioner's Office, who said that Cui had many aliases, and that the Commissioner's Office itself had captured several imposters of Cui Bangjie on numerous occasions. Based on this, the news from the Tianjin-Beiping area is likely inaccurate. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) The Red Spear Society and Yellow Turban Society of Nanle, Daming, gathered again on the 29th with 4,000 people, pushing to the outskirts of Nanle City, demanding the complete withdrawal of the tax police battalion stationed in the county seat within five days, otherwise they would lay siege. The county magistrate and gentry are running around to mediate. This renewed conflict occurred because the tax police of the eighth district of Daming were transferred to Nanle on the 27th and arrested five salt miners scraping nitrate along the way. The Nanle county magistrate was afraid of provoking an incident, so he asked the team to release them after five days of detention. However, the people believed that the tax police had promised the farmers to scrape the locked salt for a year, but now they had gone back on their word, which was clearly a breach of trust. Therefore, the leaders of the self-defense corps, Zhang Huaide and Zhang Huairong, seized the opportunity to incite another disturbance. The provincial government has received telegrams from the county magistrates of Nanle and Daming, ordering them to mediate properly and prevent bloodshed. (1st Special Dispatch)</p>

They are willing to surrender their broker's licenses and voluntarily close down. Small rice shops will not sell anything except for the required amount per capita, which has a huge impact. Barge crews also joined the strike because there was no rice market and went to the party and government agencies to petition. Various industry associations sent telegrams to the provincial departments to ask for help. The county magistrate specially invited the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce to the county to ask for ways to mediate. However, the rice merchants have a firm attitude and are very angry.

<p>(Nanjing) According to news from the capital, a certain country's news agency recently announced that the Belgian government plans to formally recognize the puppet Manchukuo within days in order to establish formal diplomatic relations. The reporter believes that non-recognition of puppet states is a principle that all countries adhere to, but today, this rumor suddenly appeared from a certain country, which is worthy of attention. Therefore, he visited the Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday to inquire about the situation. According to reports, regarding Belgium's recognition of the puppet Manchukuo, our country has repeatedly received telegrams from the embassy in Belgium, stating that the Belgian Ministry of Foreign Affairs has formally stated in person that the news of recognizing the puppet state is a rumor fabricated by traitors, which is absolutely untrue, and has telegraphed this intention to the Belgian Ambassador to China, Jacques de Gieux, for his information. Recently, the Belgian Ambassador also stated to our side that the telegram published in a Shanghai newspaper that the new Belgian government will soon recognize the puppet Manchukuo was inquired by the embassy from the Belgian government, and the reply stated that the news has no basis. It can be seen that the rumors spread by certain countries are absolutely unreliable. (1st Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e83">Concern for Secondary Education <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>— Ru</p>
<p>All parents with young children studying in secondary schools are concerned about secondary education. Parents usually expect their children to study hard and warn them against idleness. But at this time, they are worried about their studies. When asked what they are troubled by, they say that the workload is too heavy or the curriculum is not suitable.</p>
<p>Junior high schools have 34 to 35 hours of lessons per week. Someone estimated that it is 12 or 13 hours more than the fourth grade of French middle schools, and 5 or 6 hours more than the third grade of German academic high schools. Senior high schools have 31 to 34 hours of lessons per week. This is 8 to 11 hours more than the philosophy grade of French middle schools, and 2 to 5 hours more than the first grade of German academic high schools. The rigorous cultivation of French and German middle schools is world-renowned, but the homework in our country's middle schools is even heavier. Combining lesson time and self-study time at school, junior high school students work 48 hours per week, and senior high school students work 60 hours per week. In addition, the monthly exams, term exams, and entrance exams create constant fear and extreme tension. Leaving aside life education and production education, the question of whether this book knowledge can be absorbed and integrated calmly is also doubtful. Even more, it affects the physical and mental development of young people and indirectly affects the future health of the nation.</p>
<p>Senior high school courses once adopted a system of dividing subjects and elective subjects. In recent years, due to the needs of university admissions, it has been said that it is appropriate to improve the level, reversing what was done before. Senior high school students, regardless of gender, whether they go to college or not, and regardless of whether those who go to college study liberal arts, law, commerce, science, engineering, or medicine, are all given a fixed and uniform curriculum. Among them, mathematics, in particular, requires all students to study algebra, geometry, trigonometry, and an outline of analytic geometry, which is feared by most young people. When their level is measured, the entrance exam scores are still the worst in mathematics. After all, people's minds are different, and no exam can force them to be the same. Those who discuss it also quote European middle schools as models, criticizing the system of dividing subjects, believing that it is merely imitating the superficial aspects of American education, and ignoring the fact that the decline in the level of middle schools is related to teachers, teaching materials, methods, equipment, and even the entire academic atmosphere. It is by no means a single issue of dividing subjects. If we must compare it with European and American middle schools, according to what we know for sure, the preparatory middle schools for college admissions in Europe have more divisions of schools, classes, and groups than American middle schools, which only divide subjects by college admissions and occupation. The methods of middle schools in various countries are recorded in documents and are visible to everyone. It is not difficult to review them. Moreover, the simple principle of teaching according to aptitude does not require detailed examination of precedents and then proof. However, the opinions of the education community have diverged so much in the past ten years, which is puzzling.</p>
<p>Recently, the Ministry of Education formulated the outline of the method for provincial and municipal secondary normal education research associations, ordering all provinces and cities to establish research associations immediately, and limiting the reporting of research results to the ministry before the end of May. We firmly believe that middle school principals and education experts who participate in this important meeting will be able to study fairly and according to what is appropriate, and not take their personal preferences as public right and wrong. Then, the future of youth education will be fortunate.</p>

<h3 id="e84">A Great Threat to World Peace: Germany Begins Rearmament; Compulsory Military Service Implemented Yesterday; Massive Production of Military Supplies and Aircraft; Able to Fight in Less Than a Year <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) Germany will have sufficient strength by March next year and will be able to cope with a major war. This alarming news was released to the Associated Press today by senior military advisers from member states of the League of Nations. It is reported that the German government has been manufacturing massive amounts of war materials since October last year. This manufacturing plan can be completed within 16 to 17 months. Most military experts estimate that Germany already has 3,300 aircraft, pilots say so, while Britain only has 2,200 and France has no more than 5,000. French officials said that although Germany currently lacks large bombers, it is rapidly manufacturing them in large quantities, and their quality is superior to that of aircraft from other countries. It is also heard that the German Ministry of the Army had long planned to manufacture the latest weapons, the root models of which have been destroyed, but the drawings are carefully preserved for future reference. Until October last year, when Supreme Leader Hitler ordered the start of manufacturing, the whole country worked together. By March next year, it will be sufficient for the application of the new German army, and there will be a lot of preparation. Yesterday, although the German Embassy in the UK denied that the German air force was not superior to the British, it was also equal to the British. Some military aspects do not believe this statement. (1st - National Telegram)</p>
<p>Methods of Implementing Compulsory Military Service</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany's move to expand its army in violation of the peace treaty is scheduled to begin today. According to current estimates, Germany has a total of 750,000 troops. According to reliable sources, the implementation methods of the compulsory military service system are as follows: a total of 580,000 people in the 1915 class will be convened today, of which 300,000 will enter the camp for service. As for the classes from 1901 to 1909, they will receive short-term military training in the coming years, no more than eight weeks each time. The 1901 class will be convened on October 1 this year, and the second batch will be convened on April 1 next year. It is heard that the selection is very strict, and special consideration will be given to married people and professional talents. Preparations such as the accommodation of new recruits are being actively carried out. A new national defense law will be announced soon to establish a national defense administrative committee. Generals Ludendorff and Seeckt, famous during the European War, will be powerful figures in this committee. The Minister of Finance is racking his brains to find a way to balance the budget because the funds needed by the army and navy are huge. At the same time, in order to keep Germany moving forward, a special law has now been promulgated authorizing the Minister of Finance to assume certain guarantees, such as raising 200 million marks to promote German export trade, raising 100 million marks to increase funding for more work, and raising 88 million marks for agricultural funding. (1st - Reuters)</p>
<p>Total Military Strength Reaches 9 Million</p>
<p>(Berlin) According to military sources, the total number of German troops, excluding those who participated in the European War, is about 9 million. Those engaged in compulsory labor service will be the preliminary preparation for military service. All classes from 1901 to 1915 must be conscripted. Among them, those from 1901 to 1909 should receive eight weeks of military training, and those from 1910 to 1915 should receive six months or one year of training. Therefore, Germany's military strength is as follows: (1) The National Defense Force, in principle, has 100,000 professional soldiers; (2) The professional soldiers recruited from the Green Shirts and Black Shirts Guards under the Air Minister Goering, the total number of which is more than 100,000; (3) New recruits recruited from various classes, of which there are about 600,000 in the 1915 class, about 400,000 in the 1916 class, about 350,000 in the 1917 class, and about 300,000 in the 1918 class. Therefore, the issue of military quotas is not difficult to solve in terms of numbers.</p>
<p>National Finance Adds Heavy Burden</p>
<p>However, in terms of finance, there are still many difficulties. Every German conscripted into the army must be paid 40 pfennigs per day, and his wife will be given 45 marks of alimony per month. In addition, children's education expenses and housing funds are not included. Therefore, every conscripted soldier inevitably increases the country's huge burden. According to the former Minister of National Defense, General Xue Kede, the principle of establishing a professional commando team and supplementing it with conscription has been abandoned by the government and the principle of compulsory military service has been adopted. In theory, this principle should make the whole country a soldier, but in practice, the professional army will still only be 200,000 in a few years, but in addition, it will increase the conscription quota.</p>
<p>General Staff Formally Restored</p>
<p>The newly promulgated law stipulates the restoration of the General Staff (according to the Treaty of Versailles, Germany is prohibited from establishing a General Staff). Former Chief of Staff Ludendorff has officially resumed his original position. In addition, the Supreme Military Conference is jointly organized by representatives of the army and navy. General Seeckt, who is now assisting General Chiang Kai-shek in suppressing bandits in China, will also return to China to participate in the Supreme Military Conference. (1st - Havas)</p>
<p>Supreme Leader's Spokesperson Declares to the Outside World</p>
<p>Goebbels, Minister of Propaganda of Germany, recently made a declaration here in Karlsruhe, Germany, saying, "We will never threaten other countries, but we cannot tolerate the threats of other countries. Our country has now become a sovereign and complete country again. Germany does not think of war. Those who say that Germany is engaged in war must be villains who speak too much and must lose. The world says that Germany demands a part of the Polish corridor and the territory of the Czech Republic and Austria, as well as Alsace-Lorraine and other territories, which are completely forged. Foreign newspapers publish this kind of false news, which is enough to disrupt world peace. I hope that the people of the world will respect each other in order to lay the foundation of peace. Germany will naturally work for this kind of peace, and German athletes are willing to dedicate themselves to peace." (31st - Havas)</p>
<h3 id="e85">Anglo-Russian Joint Declaration: Willing to Cooperate to Promote Peace; Clarification of the Purpose of the East European Security Organization: Not to Encircle or Isolate Any Country <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>(Moscow) British Lord Privy Seal Anthony Eden came here to discuss with the Soviet Russian authorities the European crisis caused by Germany's decision to rearm. He has obtained a promise from the Russian authorities to cooperate with Britain in seeking peace. After the meeting, a communique was issued, stating that Britain and Russia are willing to cooperate to seek peace. The text stated that the talks between the two sides involved major events in the current international situation, such as the East European Pact and the matters mentioned in the Anglo-French communique of February 3. (Note: The Anglo-French communique stated the need to maintain the independence and integrity of Austria, advocated inviting Germany to cooperate, opposed unilateral actions to deny international obligations, welcomed the conclusion of a European mutual assistance pact, suggested replacing the military restrictions imposed on Germany by the Treaty of Versailles with an agreement, Germany's return to the League of Nations, and the conclusion of an air pact.)</p>
<p>Talks Between Both Sides: Sincere and Friendly</p>
<p>Eden and Litvinov also discussed the future development and enhancement of Anglo-Russian relations. Eden also exchanged views on this issue with Stalin and Molotov. The talks between the two sides were conducted in an atmosphere of friendship and sincerity throughout. Eden informed Litvinov of the situation of the Anglo-German talks in Berlin. Both sides believed that such talks would help clarify the overall situation in Europe.</p>
<p>Collective Security: A Matter of Utmost Urgency</p>
<p>Eden, Litvinov, Stalin, and Molotov also believed that in the current international situation, it is a matter of utmost urgency to strive to create a system of European collective security as mentioned in the Anglo-French communique of February 3, in accordance with the principles of the League of Nations. Stalin, Molotov, and Litvinov also earnestly stated that the organization of East European security and the conclusion of mutual assistance pacts are not intended to encircle any country or isolate it. They are intended to create equal security for participating countries, and therefore welcome the participation of Germany and Poland, as this would provide the most satisfactory solution to the problem.</p>
<p>Anglo-Russian Interests: No Conflict</p>
<p>After a sincere exchange of views, the representatives of the British and Russian governments recognized that there are currently no conflicts of interest between the two governments on any major issues of international policy. This is a solid foundation for the two countries to cooperate sincerely in seeking peace. They also believe that since both countries recognize that peace can benefit both sides, they will naturally govern their mutual relations in a spirit of cooperation and loyalty to their obligations as members of the League of Nations. In view of these reasons, Eden, Stalin, Molotov, and Litvinov affirmed that they hold the same view and feel that the two countries working together in a friendly spirit to manage the general work of the organization of peace and security blocs is the first and most important step in promoting international efforts to achieve this goal. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Regarding the section in the communique hoping that Germany and Poland would participate in the East European Mutual Assistance Pact, Soviet Russian officials stated that the so-called "best solution" does not mean that the participation of Germany and Poland is the only solution. It is now known that the above-mentioned communique was originally scheduled to be announced at 6:00 PM (Russian time), but it was delayed because Eden wanted to consult the British government for approval. It was later learned that after the reply telegram from London arrived, Maisky (Soviet Ambassador to the United Kingdom) made several trips back and forth between the Foreign Affairs Committee and the British Embassy before the wording of the communique was finalized. (Havas dispatch, 31st)</p>
<p>Enhanced Diplomatic Relations: A Clear Symbol</p>
<p>(London) The foreign affairs correspondent of the Daily Telegraph attaches great importance to Stalin's personal contribution to the Anglo-Russian talks. It is said that Eden's impression of the Soviet Russian dictator is that Stalin not only has a thorough observation of international issues, but also has a deep understanding of the characteristics of other countries. This is a fortunate fact, as it can enable Stalin to understand the reasons why Britain cannot be an active participant in the East European security system. The correspondent continued that the statement in the Moscow official newspaper that the purpose of the East European peace organization is not to encircle any country or isolate any country will be welcomed by London. The principles of non-aggression and the loyalty of both countries to the League of Nations mentioned in the official newspaper can be regarded as a symbol of the obvious improvement in diplomatic relations between communist Russia and capitalist Britain. The Daily Mail retaliated with the headline "Anglo-Russian Competition Has Ended" over the news of Eden's departure from Moscow, and stated that after Eden's meetings with Stalin and Litvinov, both sides were surprised that the two countries' views on world issues were so close. (Guomin News Agency dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Mutual Recognition of Territorial Integrity: A Striking Statement in the Communique</p>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russian officials are extremely satisfied with the results of the talks between the British and Soviet sides. Some sections of the communique issued yesterday exceeded all expectations. For example, the representatives of the two countries expressed their willingness to recognize each other's territorial integrity, which is one of the most striking statements in the communique and was not initially expected. After carefully studying the communique, it can be seen that in the future, it will be Soviet Russia, not Britain, that promotes Germany and Poland's participation in the East European Mutual Assistance Pact. The reason why the Soviet Union was able to achieve success is that the excessive demands made by the German leader Hitler created this opportunity. In short, some people believe that German foreign policy has made mistakes. Eden treated them with sincerity, while Litvinov used his agile skills. Now, looking at Eden's trip, we know that this speculation is not false. A confidant of Eden said, "The field between Britain and Russia has now been cleared, and the sincere cooperation between the two countries has been confirmed." Since the talks in Berlin, the situation has been clarified. It is not difficult for us to predict that as Eden continues his visit to Warsaw, the concept of peace will be flourishing. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Anglo-Russian Opinions Converge: French Newspapers Express Optimism</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers believe that the communique issued after the talks between the British and Soviet ministers is very different in wording from the communique issued after the talks between the British and German ministers. Therefore, they express optimism about the results of the Anglo-Soviet talks. Le Petit Parisien reported, "After the British Lord Privy Seal Eden arrived in Moscow, the Soviet Union warmly welcomed him. The atmosphere of the two talks in Berlin and Moscow and the communiques issued were also different, which shows that Eden's trip was purely exploratory in nature. It has indeed promoted the rapprochement between Britain and the Soviet Union, and also shows that British foreign policy does not allow Germany to be excluded from the Western European powers, but rather draws a line between them." Le Matin commented on the compromise between Britain and the Soviet Union, saying that each country once again applied for German cooperation without hesitation. L'Echo de Paris said, "The communique issued by Moscow is full of enthusiasm in its wording. If we want to understand its profound meaning, we should know that Eden and his interlocutors both attach importance to the Northeast European Mutual Assistance Pact plan. In this way, France does not need to choose a partner between Britain and its allies in Central and Eastern Europe, because Britain and France have the same views on the Northeast European Mutual Assistance Pact plan." Le Journal acknowledged that the wording of the Moscow communique was sincere, but its significance should not be exaggerated, as "its content is not as good as semi-official news. What Britain has done is to let the Soviet Union act on its own, and it remains aloof from the collective security system." Le Figaro said, "If Hitler believes that he can win over Britain to join a crusade against Bolshevism, his views are the same as those of the deposed Emperor Wilhelm II, using fantasies to promote foreign policy."

<p>Warsaw The British Lord Privy Seal Eden, referred to by the local newspapers as one of the most capable young diplomats in the world, will arrive here tonight from Moscow. He originally planned to stay at the British Embassy, but due to the illness of the ambassador, he changed his accommodation to the Hotel Europa. Tomorrow morning, he will meet with Polish Minister of Military Affairs Marshal Piłsudski, known as the "strongman" of Poland, to discuss the overall situation in Europe, and will discuss diplomatic affairs with Foreign Minister Colonel Beck. It is expected that Polish diplomats will not put forward any new proposals, but hope to hear Eden's fair opinions on the results of the talks in Germany and Russia. It is heard that the Polish authorities are prepared to express agreement with any reasonable proposals put forward by Eden. (Reuters dispatch, 1st) After consulting with Marshal Piłsudski and others in Warsaw, Eden plans to go to Prague, the capital of Czechoslovakia, to carry out the final stage of his trip, and then return to London by plane on April 4 to report on his mission.

<p>Affectionate Farewell to Russia</p>
<p>(Moscow) Eden left here happily tonight for the Polish capital to carry out the third stage of his mission. Before his departure, Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, British Ambassador Chilston, and other Soviet Russian dignitaries and diplomats were all at the platform to see him off. A red carpet was laid on the platform, and a team of elite Red Army soldiers was lined up. The British and Russian national flags were displayed side by side. Film cameramen recorded this memorable scene. After Eden arrived at the station, he made a speech through a loudspeaker thanking the Soviet Russian government and people for their generous treatment. Litvinov replied, "I wish you success. Your success is our success." Before long, the whistle sounded and the train started moving forward at 10:45 PM. (Reuters dispatch, 31st)</p>

<p>(London) The "News Chronicle" took this opportunity to publish an article written by the London correspondent of the "Warsaw Post," strongly asserting that Poland has always opposed the principles of the multilateral East European Pact. First, it stated, "If Germany develops towards Eastern Europe, it will inevitably encounter Poland's resistance. Some people believe that Poland can obtain assistance from Nazi Germany or Soviet Russia. This statement is not worth the laughter of those in the know, because Poland does not want other countries' troops to enter its territory. Whether it is Germany or Russia, whether it is an allied country or an enemy country, we will not allow its troops to pass through Poland's borders." The conclusion stated, "Poland takes the interests of the Western European powers as its own interests, but the Western European powers should also take the interests of Poland as their own interests."

<p>Warsaw The local newspapers received a dispatch from Paris stating that Britain's new proposals regarding the East European Pact have been submitted to the Paris authorities. The British government hopes that the East European Pact should be of the same nature as the League of Nations Covenant, that is, all resolutions should only take effect after being passed unanimously by the signatory countries.

<p>(Tokyo) It is heard that the British representative Eden and the Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov discussed the Far Eastern Locarno Pact. The spokesperson of the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs criticized this statement, saying that there is no place like Locarno in the Far East. The changes in the European political situation are extremely frequent and extremely rapid, and are beyond human comprehension. Therefore, the Japanese are not paying attention to Europe now. Before the war, the changes in the European political situation immediately affected the Far East, but this is completely different now. Japan has not received a formal proposal from the Russian government regarding a mutual non-aggression pact. However, the Russian representative in Japan and the Japanese government representative recently exchanged frank opinions on resolving the outstanding issues between the two countries. The Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov once told Japanese journalists that Soviet Russia is prepared to discuss a pact with Japan on mutual non-aggression and not building defensive works. However, Japan believes that before concluding a mutual non-aggression pact, it is necessary to resolve the clause in the Treaty of Portsmouth that does not allow the construction of defensive works, extending it to the Russian "Manchurian" border, in order to eliminate the causes of aggression and abolish the methods of aggression. (Reuters dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese government plans to gradually resolve the diplomatic issues between Japan and the Soviet Union in accordance with the established policy before the start of negotiations on the transfer of the Middle Eastern Railway, and then conclude a non-aggression treaty to establish peaceful relations between the two countries, which is a peaceful adjustment policy for Japanese-Soviet relations. The Soviet Union also wants to conclude a non-aggression treaty as a prerequisite for establishing peaceful cooperation. Recently, Germany recognized the Soviet Union as an enemy of Western European civilization and expressed its absolute opposition to the Soviet Union's participation in the East European Locarno Treaty. This matter caused a major shock to the Soviet leadership, which automatically transferred about half of the 200,000 Red Army soldiers in the Far East to that area to deal with the situation in Eastern Europe. It is believed that the Soviet leadership will propose this issue as a mutual issue, or related to the issue of the demilitarization of the border area between the Soviet Union and "Manchuria" and the issue of a non-aggression treaty. Therefore, the contact between Japan and the Soviet Union following the withdrawal of troops is extremely noteworthy. (Denstu dispatch, 1st)</p>

<p>(Moscow) An article by Bukharin published in Izvestia discusses the issue of peace and the dangerous places in the world. Until recently, there was a dangerous threat of war in the Far East. Japan's aggression against China, its occupation of Manchuria, and its far-reaching plans of conquest (and involving Soviet territory) are the greatest threat to peace. When Bukharin mentioned the war machine in Europe, he pointed out Germany's threats to Memel, Austria, and Lithuania, as well as Hitler's attitude towards the Soviet Union's peaceful policy. Bukharin's militarism: "The Soviet Union never wants war. This is naturally due to its great historical mission. The basic principles and guiding spirit of the Soviet Union's foreign policy are to strive for peace. In our view, since the Soviet Union now represents the interests of 150 million working people and is the most suitable and solid fortress of peace, who can deny that the Soviet Union's cooperation with the bourgeois countries that truly want to maintain peace and whose foreign policy supports the prevention of war is completely in line with its socialist nature? The purpose of the East European Mutual Assistance Pact is to extinguish the fire, and all countries concerned have the opportunity to conclude a pact jointly responsible for the territory of Eastern Europe. Therefore, whether this pact can become a universal agreement for all countries concerned depends entirely on the decision of Germany and Poland." Bukharin concluded, "In the struggle for peace, we should make full use of even the smallest possibility, because this is our historical mission, regardless of whether the provocative forces will implement their policies."

<p>(Paris) French public opinion attaches great importance to yesterday's talks between Foreign Minister Laval and the British and Russian ambassadors. It is heard that during the talks between the British ambassador and Laval, the British Foreign Secretary Simon provided more detailed information on the contents of his talks in Germany, and also clarified the results of the negotiations of Lord Privy Seal Eden in Russia. The talks between Laval and the Russian ambassador were mainly about Laval's visit to Moscow, as the French Foreign Minister plans to visit Russia on April 20, and held preliminary diplomatic talks with the Russian ambassador. The French newspapers, in view of the fact that German leader Hitler has adopted a "completely negative attitude" towards the East European Pact, have unanimously recognized that this is serious and may cause serious political problems, because according to the original plan, Germany's signing was the most important part of the East European Pact plan. Now, diplomatic figures are running around because it is not clear whether the countries will allow Germany to automatically join at any time in the future, and whether the pact will include this clause.

<p>(New York) International banker J.P. Morgan, age 68, is now converting 70% of his assets into cash to pay the state and federal income taxes due after his death. Morgan's assets are estimated to be at least \$100 million. The famous J.P. Morgan Bank has 89 branches, and its total assets were estimated at \$200 million before the economic recession. News that Morgan was aggressively raising cash, even selling his yacht, caused a stir among financiers. It is now confirmed that this move is solely to preserve his financial power after death. Only a small portion of Morgan's assets are in securities that can be readily converted to cash. Morgan now wants to securely pass his bank on to his descendants, so he is converting notes into cash to prepare for contingencies. Recent rumors that Morgan was selling his Long Island property and some of his antiques with the intention of moving to England were dismissed today by Morgan in an interview with the Associated Press. He believes that America has safely emerged from the economic panic, and that inflation is impossible. Morgan then discussed the future of commerce and finance optimistically, stating that the cash he needs now is solely for paying estate taxes, amounting to about 70% of his total assets. The J.P. Morgan Bank will remain under the control of his family. (National Electric dispatch, 31st)</p>

<p>Nanchang dispatch: The six counties that were most deeply affected by communist banditry in the past—Ningdu, Ruijin, Huichang, Xingguo, Yudu, and Shicheng—are suffering from chaotic land rights due to the land having been divided up by the bandits. There is also a severe shortage of oxen, farming implements, and seeds. Even those who have land and people are unable to cultivate the land. In light of this, the Provincial Rural Cooperative Committee is using 700,000 yuan in post-disaster fundamental treatment funds to reorganize land rights and boundaries in the aforementioned six counties, and to provide loans for resuming cultivation. The Committee's office in Ningdu has repeatedly consulted with the special commissioners of the twelve districts to implement the allocation of land based on population, in accordance with the land handling regulations promulgated by the Xingying (Military Affairs Commission). Each county has also convened district and baojia (local administrative units) chiefs to discuss the implementation steps, ensuring that there are people to cultivate the land and that there is land for people to cultivate, avoiding renewed tenancy disputes or mutual hesitation. Every able-bodied man in the bandit areas can receive a certain amount of land, and then they can use cooperation to supply oxen, farming implements, and seeds to resume cultivation. (March 24th)</p>

<p>Guangzhou dispatch: The Guangdong-Guangxi Southwestern Civil Aviation Company operates regular civil aviation flights between Longzhou and Guangzhou, transporting passengers and mail. On the 22nd of this month, the company's civil aviation aircraft "Changgeng" was flying east from Longzhou back to Guangdong, piloted by pilot Feng Xinghang. The aircraft departed from Longzhou on the morning of that day and arrived in Nanning at around 11:00 a.m. After unloading mail and cargo, three passengers boarded: a German, Yu Changju, the South China manager of the Xintong Trading Company, and Qiu Guozhen, a colonel staff officer of the Guangxi Army Headquarters. It departed from Nanning and arrived in Wuzhou at 1:00 p.m., landing at the Gaowang Airport across the river from Wuzhou. As usual, there was a brief stop in Wuzhou, and the pilot and passengers had lunch together. The company's Wuzhou station staff also loaded newspapers and mail onto the aircraft, along with some light goods. At 3:15 p.m., after everything was prepared, it took off for Guangdong. Prior to departure, the pilot inspected the aircraft's components and added fuel. As it soared upwards and circled once, intending to head east, the aircraft suddenly emitted sparks from the engine about two minutes after leaving the airport, accompanied by a loud noise. The pilot knew something was wrong and quickly steered the aircraft towards the river, causing it to crash into the water. However, the engine had already failed, and at 3:25 p.m., the entire aircraft descended vertically, plunging into the water, causing water to splash in all directions and creating a large white wave. The passengers inside the aircraft knew there was no escape. The German was the first to break through the glass door and escape. Pilot Feng Xinghang also risked his life to get out. The two passengers in the back seat, Yu and Qiu, clung to the aircraft's wings, floating on the surface of the water, and shouted for help. The Wuzhou station staff of the civil aviation company, hearing the alarm, immediately sent a boat to rescue them. A Mobil Oil Company gasoline boat nearby arrived first and rescued the pilot and three passengers, sending them back to Wuzhou City, where they were settled separately. Among the passengers, only the German suffered minor head injuries. Pilot Feng Xinghang suffered no major injuries to his hands and feet. Although passengers Qiu and Yu had a scare, they were unharmed and took a civilian ship back to Guangdong that night. The mail and goods carried on the "Changgeng" aircraft were lost to the east, and after the entire aircraft sank, it is not known where it drifted. The Wuzhou station staff are currently trying to salvage it. It is said that the loss from this aircraft accident is no less than 200,000 yuan. (March 27th)</p>

<h3 id="e107">Revocation of Land Grant for Confucian Temple <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The land on which the Confucian temple in this county is located was previously granted to local residents by the Office of Public Property, causing surprise among the local populace. In November of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933], the county government submitted a request to the provincial government, which issued Directive No. 25 of the Finance Department, approving the revocation of the land grant, refunding the original price, canceling the ministerial certificate, and ordering the Bureau of Education to take back possession and safeguard the property, while also informing the Office of Public Property for compliance. More than a year has passed, but the land recipients have not yet complied. The Mountain Bureau of Education requested instructions from the county government. Now, the Office of Public Property has reported that the recipients of the land grant for the government's Confucian temple are Wang Sanhuai, Yu Jisheng, Ye Genzhu, and Jin Rong; and the recipients of the county's Confucian temple land grant are the Yin family, Chen Zujian, Hongde, and Zhang Zuoji. The head patrol officer of the First Precinct, Lu Jianfen, has been ordered to summon them to the Shatianzhu Bureau to receive the refund and surrender their certificates to resolve the outstanding case.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Qingpu: Dispute During Party Headquarters' Joint Commemoration Week <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The County Party Headquarters held a joint commemoration week yesterday. Because the representatives from various district branch offices raised questions about party affairs, they posed several questions to the chairman, who was unable to answer them, arousing public anger and leading to a dispute. A detailed account is presented to the provincial government for review, as follows: The Qingpu County Party Headquarters held a joint commemoration week yesterday morning at 9:00 a.m. In addition to the participation of the city, Chairman Cheng Sinong performed the rituals. After the chairman finished his report, various points of contention were raised, with questions posed: (1) The Xicen Book and Newspaper Agency, established by the County Party Headquarters, was previously opposed, so why was it suddenly reopened? (2) Zai Diren lives in Huangdu and works primarily in Huangdu, so why is his party membership in Baihejiang? (3) There is solid evidence that Wu Changqi of the tax collection office embezzled public funds, so why did the Party newspaper initially strongly condemn him and then ignore the issue? (4) When a refugee disturbance occurred in Yangdian Village in the second district, why did the County Party Headquarters not pay attention to it before the issue was resolved? (5) Why can prospective party members be entirely controlled by Standing Committee member Huang Xuze personally, who even fabricates forms on his own? (6) Regarding the Huangdu rice robbery and the Qingpu Entertainment Center brawl last year, why were they not disclosed in the Party newspaper because they were unfavorable to Huang Xuze? At the time, the chairman was unable to answer any of the questions. Comrades demanded that Huang Xuze, a Standing Committee member of the County Party Headquarters, be personally responsible for answering them. However, Huang was in Huangdu on private business and had not returned, so Chairman Cheng Sinong could not provide answers, and attempted to declare the ceremony completed and dismiss the meeting. This agitated the public, causing a dispute.</p>

<p>Two bandit boats carrying more than twenty bandits arrived at Ruomao浜 in Zhouzhuang Township the night before last, robbing more than ten households, resulting in losses of over a thousand taels of silver. They then went to Zhujiahe Village and robbed seven households, including Shen Luming's, resulting in losses of approximately five to six thousand taels of silver. Furthermore, Yang Laotai and more than twenty others from Xiatang in Qimen hired a boat to Hangzhou to offer incense. While passing near Pingwang, they were robbed by bandits, and all the incense worshippers were searched, none spared, with losses of five to six hundred yuan. Also, on the night of the 29th, more than ten bandits arrived at the home of a farmer surnamed Sun in Tuncun, Wujiang County. They tied up Sun and shot him in the foot. As Sun struggled, the bandits fired another shot, which unfortunately hit a vital spot, resulting in his death. After receiving reports from the victims and various squads, Zhou, the chief of the 2nd waterway police district, immediately ordered his subordinates yesterday (the 1st) to strictly investigate and arrest the perpetrators.</p>

<p>Two youths from Ningbo, Tan Zuyin and Tan Mengming, came to Wuxi in winter, carrying a survey book. They went to various merchants inside and outside the city, claiming to be from the Shanghai Commercial Advertising Agency, coming to Wuxi to conduct commercial surveys, with no other purpose. They recorded the name, address, telephone number, and manager's name of each store in the book, and instructed each store to affix a seal in the book. At the time, the stores did not suspect anything. Recently, the Tans suddenly came to Wuxi again, still carrying the same survey book. However, next to the seals of each merchant in the book, the words "Attention: Publication Fee of One Yuan, Payable After Publication" had been added. They also carried a commercial directory containing the names of stores in Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, and other places, totaling over ten thousand households. They went door-to-door to the merchants they had surveyed last year, collecting an advertising fee of one yuan. The stores, realizing that they had claimed to be conducting commercial surveys last year but were now suddenly collecting publication fees, suspected that they were fraudulently obtaining money and reported them to the police. The police took them to the First Branch of the Public Security Bureau. Many of the defrauded merchants went to the bureau to report them. After Officer Min opened court and questioned them, the Tans confessed that they had only printed one copy of the commercial directory and were evasive about other matters. They only wanted to refund the publication fees they had collected. Officer Min, considering that the case involved fraud, deemed it inappropriate to release them lightly and immediately sent them to the General Bureau for interrogation and detention, awaiting transfer to the court for legal proceedings.</p>

<p>Since the explicit prohibition of prostitution in this county, although public prostitutes have gradually decreased, the number of secret private prostitutes has suddenly increased. According to recent statistics from various hospitals, a large number of patients are suffering from gonorrhea, syphilis, and other diseases. It is believed that the cause is the spread by private prostitutes. In light of this, the county government has drafted regulations for the management of prostitutes, allowing them to pay monthly donations to operate, designating doctors to examine their bodies once a week, and ordering those with diseases to seek treatment to prevent transmission. The regulations also prescribe attire to prevent them from mingling with respectable women. Yesterday (the 30th), the detailed regulations were submitted to the Civil Affairs Department for review. Once approved, they can be implemented.</p>

<p>The Jiangdu County Government is facing a shortage of funds for purchasing rice and providing seeds for the disaster areas of the eighth and ninth districts. It has allocated 2,000 yuan to be raised by the Jiangdu Buddhist Association. The association has now convened the abbots of temples in urban and rural areas to discuss a solution. It has been decided that the amount to be donated will be based on the amount of temple-owned farmland, with the amount to be raised calculated on a per-mu basis. The amount to be donated will be calculated in the following way: farmland in disaster areas is excluded; for temples with less than 500 mu of land, each mu will donate 1 jiao of silver; for temples with more than 500 mu, each mu will donate 8 fen of silver; temples with no farmland and retired monks will be solicited by the association through Jian Cheng, Songshan, Mo Zhi, Wei Jing, Miao Ji, Xin Tan, and Ai Dao Tang, who will carry donation books and collect the pledged donations. The deadline for collecting the donations and submitting them to the association is April 7th, so that they can be forwarded to the county.

<p>The Zhenjiang-Yangzhou Long-Distance Bus Company previously changed its schedule due to the cold weather and short days, operating seven round trips on Saturdays and six round trips on other days. Now, due to the lengthening days of spring, it has been decided that starting from the 1st, seven round trips will be operated daily.

The Jiangsu-Anhui Postal Administration has decided to open a third-class post office there and has appointed Cheng Zuyan, the chief of the Dongdajie branch in Jiangyin, as the director.

<p>Yangzhuang in this district is the starting section for diverting the Huai River into the sea. [Text missing.] To the west is where the water of the Huai River is stored. If the dam is damaged, it will inevitably affect the downstream Huai River diversion project. The Engineering Office reported that the dam was in disrepair. Not only would this affect the upcoming flood season, but its height would not be sufficient to protect the project. Therefore, on the 30th, the office dispatched Wang Mengzhou, the director of the construction section, and Zhu Gongshuo, the head of the materials section, to assess the situation and make preparations for construction to begin on a selected date.</p>

<p>Lianshui is located in the center of the Huai River Diversion Project and its engineering is extremely important. Therefore, County Magistrate Shen Jinghua does not dare to neglect any of the project sections within the county's borders. It was recently reported that there were instances of laziness and gambling among the workers in the Diàn湖 area east of the county. This not only hinders the progress of the project but also causes disputes. In addition to immediately ordering strict prohibition, he personally went to the Diàn湖 construction area to inspect and supervise the soil removal work. He visited on the 25th and only returned yesterday. Furthermore, various Huai River diversion project markers in Lianshui are often mistakenly pulled out by farmers due to the vastness of the land and the difficulty of taking care of them, which hinders the project. Yesterday, each section reported this problem, and a notice was issued simultaneously to prohibit it. In the future, anyone who damages the markers will be punished accordingly without leniency.</p>

<p>The seventh and eighth districts of this county in the west of the lake suffered a drought last year, resulting in a complete crop failure.

<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Bureau, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Railways, held a sanitation campaign on the entire line yesterday (April 1st). The national flag was hung at the North Station and stations along the two lines. Sanitation charts were displayed inside the stations, and a propaganda train was launched for publicity. The reporter from Shenshi News Agency learned the details and described them as follows:</p>
<p>Held on the Entire Line Yesterday</p>
<p>The Railways Bureau, in accordance with the regulations of the Ministry of Railways, held the second sanitation campaign yesterday (the first was held last year). The national flag was hung at the gate of the North Station, along with a white banner that read "Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railways Sanitation Campaign." All stations along the line were similarly decorated. Various sanitation charts and propaganda texts were posted inside the stations. Each major station sent propagandists to give speeches, and three propaganda trains were attached to the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou passenger trains for onboard publicity. In addition, the Preparatory Committee's Health and Cleaning Groups sent personnel to carry out tasks such as vaccination and cleaning.</p>
<p>Deputy Director Wu's Opinion</p>
<p>Wu Shaozeng, Deputy Director of the Bureau, expressed his views on the sanitation campaign yesterday, saying, "Our railway follows the orders of the Ministry of Railways and holds a sanitation campaign every year. The purpose is nothing more than two points: (1) A sound mind often resides in a sound body, and the success of work is often directly proportional to the vigor of the spirit. This is an immutable principle. Our staff serving in the railway have heavy responsibilities. If their bodies are not healthy, they will not only be unable to perform their duties happily, but also inevitably delay opportunities and cause accidents, resulting in a major blow to the business. To make the body healthy, paying attention to hygiene is a necessary path. Therefore, when we hold the sanitation campaign, internally, we make all employees pay attention to hygiene, improve their health, and thus improve work efficiency. (2) Trains come and go, and there are many passengers. If the stations, vehicles, and all traffic equipment are not kept tidy and clean, it will not only be unsightly but also inevitably leave various adverse effects on the physical and mental health of passengers. Therefore, when we hold the sanitation campaign, externally, we want to make all railway employees keep all traffic equipment clean and tidy at all times and places, thereby maintaining passenger safety and increasing common enjoyment."</p>

<p>The state-owned China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, due to business development and cooperation with the Ministry of Railways in handling national intermodal transport, felt that there were not enough ships to allocate. Therefore, it purchased a freighter, which has been completed and is expected to be delivered by the end of this month. The reporter from the Central News Agency learned the details as follows:</p>
<p>Arriving in Shanghai by the End of the Month: In order to manage various routes, the Bureau purchased a freighter built in 1910 from the French shipping management company with the surplus and remaining funds from the purchase of materials in recent months. The Ministry of Communications approved it early on. At the end of June this year, the company sent personnel to the Rhine River to pick it up, stating that the delivery would be in Shanghai and a partial deposit would be paid first. Since the ship involves manufacturing, subleasing, berthing, and other aspects of several countries, it is necessary to complete all the formalities. It is expected to arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month.</p>
<p>Named Dafei: It has been decided to name the ship Dafei. It has a total tonnage of 5,620 tons, a net tonnage of 4,070 tons, a length of 340 feet, and a speed of 11 nautical miles per hour. The purchase price is several thousand British pounds. In the future, it is planned to sail between Shanghai and Haizhou, connecting with the Longhai Railway, specializing in intermodal transport goods, because the ship is a pure freighter. It is rumored that the Bureau plans to purchase a large number of ships. According to the person in charge of the Bureau, the Central News Agency reporter said that there are indeed many people who come to solicit business, but the Bureau is limited by economics and it is difficult to realize.</p>

<p>Financial Bonds Issued Yesterday</p>
<p>In order to enrich the capital of the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, repay advances, consolidate finance, and facilitate the rescue of industry and commerce, the Ministry of Finance issued 10 million yuan of the Republic of China 24th Year Financial Bonds, which were issued at face value yesterday. Subscription warrants have been printed. After the bonds are printed, they will be exchanged. The annual interest rate is 6%, and the principal and interest will be fully repaid by March 31 of the 34th year of the Republic of China.

<p>Lending Syndicate to Be Established Soon</p>
<p>The Industrial and Commercial Credit Small Lending Plan of 5 million yuan to rescue the market, the member banks of the Banking Association have raised 2.5 million yuan, and the government's 2.5 million yuan is borne by the Central Bank, jointly forming the Industrial and Commercial Credit Small Lending Syndicate to handle it. Everything is now ready. After the Central Bank receives the order, it will be implemented immediately. Due to the China Bank issue in recent days, it has been slightly delayed. Now, Song Hanzhang has taken over as the General Manager of the China Bank, so the establishment date of the syndicate will not be far away.</p>
<p>Commercial Acceptance Bills Implemented</p>
<p>The Silk and Satin Trades Association and Silk Weaving Trade Association pioneered commercial acceptance bills, which were implemented yesterday. The Shanghai Silk Industry Bank has agreed to handle discounting. At the same time, the Central Bank has agreed to handle re-discounting.

<p>Three Banks Interbank Lending to Rescue the Market</p>
<p>After the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications designated large sums for interbank lending to the banking and money industries in order to regulate finance, although directly to the banking and money industries, and indirectly to industry and commerce, after the Ministry of Finance allocated the 24th Year Financial Bonds to enrich the capital of the three banks, the bonds were issued yesterday. From now on, the capital of the three banks will be more consolidated. Therefore, after consultation, the three banks decided to expand the interbank lending to the banking and money industries.</p>

<h3 id="e138">German Express Mail Ship "Cardillera" Arrives Today, Set to Spark Competition Among Foreign Steamships <a href="#e138" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c138" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">138</a></h3>
<p>The German HAPAG liner "Cardillera" of the Hamburg-America Line, departed from Germany on February 23rd for Shanghai. All passenger cabins were fully booked. This ship is one of the four newly added express mail ships of Germany, with a deadweight of 16,000 tons, 159 first-class cabins, 100 second-class cabins, and 110 third-class cabins. The company received a telegram yesterday from the shipowner C. D'Ottilie, stating that the ship is scheduled to enter port at 10:00 AM today, and berth at the Jardine Matheson Wharf at 11:30 AM. Therefore, the company has hired a pilot to guide the ship into port and is scheduled to depart for Japan on the 5th, and return to Shanghai on the 16th before heading back to Europe.</p>
<p>Full of Passengers</p>
<p>Among those arriving in Shanghai on this ship from Europe, 130 will disembark in Shanghai. Among the passengers is the Chinese Central Government's Minister TzeKing Ouei, along with his wife, son, and entourage, returning to the country. They will disembark at the Jardine Matheson Wharf at 11:40 AM today. As for passengers going to Europe, their tickets were fully booked a month ago. According to the company's information, the ship's round-trip passenger ticket revenue to the Far East alone amounts to approximately 600,000 Chinese national currency. Adding freight charges, the amount is considerable. The round trip takes a total of 90 days, returning to Hamburg on May 23rd.</p>
<p>"Cardillera"</p>
<p>North German Lloyd Agency</p>
<p>The original plan of HAPAG was to dispatch two special express liners each with North German Lloyd. Those dispatched by HAPAG were the "Cardillera" and "Boschdyk," while those dispatched by North German Lloyd were the "Scharnhorst" and "Gneisenau." The two companies were to operate separate schedules. After the "Cardillera" arrived, it was originally planned to invite people from all walks of life in Shanghai to visit the ship, with the company hosting. However, following an order from the German government, the HAPAG express liners were placed under the agency of North German Lloyd, to avoid competition between two German companies on the same route. Therefore, the plan was changed, and HAPAG ships were handed over to North German Lloyd for scheduling. Thus, the invitation to the "Cardillera" to the Shanghai public for a tour was cancelled.</p>
<p>Competition Among Foreign Steamships</p>
<p>North German Lloyd's first new ship, the "Scharnhorst," is scheduled to make its maiden voyage to Shanghai on the 8th of next month. Due to the exchange rate between China and Germany, the ticket prices for German express liners are cheaper compared to those of other countries. Therefore, representatives from the Japan Mail Line, Osaka Shosen Kaisha, Pacific Mail Steamship Company, China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, Dollar Steamship Lines, and American Mail Line, including Huis, Meduna, Bacon, and Clark, held a general meeting at the China Merchants company. They agreed to dissolve the passenger ticket alliance between Europe and the Far East with immediate effect, preparing to compete with German ships by lowering prices. Therefore, from the date of the "Scharnhorst's" maiden voyage, an unprecedented competition will be triggered on the China-Europe route.</p>

<p>Lankester, Chief of the Accounting Department of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration, was reinstated in mid-March of last year after the resignation of Sir Revis. He requested a one-year term, which was approved by the Ministry of Railways. At the same time, the Ministry negotiated with the Sino-British Bank to determine the successor. It was decided that Mr. Stewart would take over. Mr. Stewart arrived in the bureau in January of this year and was first assigned as an accounting specialist, serving in the Accounting Department to familiarize himself with the accounting situation of the bureau. Now, Mr. Lankester will relinquish his duties as Chief of the Accounting Department on April 1st, and Mr. Stewart will take over as Chief of the Accounting Department from that day. Mr. Lankester initially arrived at the railway on March 19, 1908, as the Director of the Passenger and Freight Section of the Accounting Department. He resigned on April 30, 1914. On December 16 of the same year, he was re-engaged by the railway and appointed as Deputy Chief Accountant. At the end of June 1923, the original Chief Accountant, Mr. Middleton, resigned and returned to England, and Mr. Lankester was promoted to fill the vacancy. He resigned again on April 30, 1931. His successor as Chief of the Accounting Department was Sir Revis. Before long, Sir Revis also resigned due to old age and weakness. Mr. Lankester was re-engaged by the bureau for the third time on March 23 of last year, resuming his original position as Chief of the Accounting Department. The bureau reported to the Ministry of Railways that Mr. Lankester had served in the bureau for a total of eleven and a half years and had made significant contributions. The Ministry of Railways awarded him a certificate of commendation. As he had to return to his country after his resignation, a farewell banquet was held at the New Asia Hotel on North Sichuan Road at noon yesterday, and Mr. Stewart was welcomed. The Chief Auditor, Secretary, and leaders of various departments were invited to accompany them. During the banquet, Deputy Director Wu of the bureau delivered a farewell speech, recounting Mr. Lankester's history of service on the railway and wishing him a successful retirement. He then reported on the experience of the newly appointed Chief, Mr. Stewart, as an introduction, and hoped that he would have the same long service and remarkable achievements as Mr. Lankester. Mr. Lankester delivered a reply, expressing his regret at leaving the railway, which he had served for nearly a quarter of a century, and wishing that even though their physical forms would be separated in the future, their spirits would remain connected. Mr. Stewart also delivered a reply, expressing his willingness to contribute his full enthusiasm and best efforts to the national railways of the Republic of China and provide the best service. Mr. Stewart was originally an accountant in England. In 1923, he went to India and worked at the Lovelock and Leweo accounting firm in Calcutta, specializing in auditing the accounts of railways, trams, electric lights, and coal mines for ten years.</p>

<p>According to the Xin Li News Agency, Korean Cui Yingxin (i.e., Li Mingyu) was arrested by the French Municipal Police at 7:00 AM on March 26 of this year at Xiecheng Lane, Rue Pére Robert. It has been found that Cui Yingxin was naturalized as Chinese on June 13, 1925, and has worked as a ticket collector at the Shanghai British Tramway Company for many years. He later engaged in the ginseng business and has always been law-abiding. Cui Yingxin's wife believes that since her husband has been naturalized as Chinese, he should be tried by the Chinese court, regardless of whether he is suspected of committing a crime. She entrusted lawyers Lou Yunmei and Xu Jie to visit the French Municipal Police and request the French Consul-General. There was no definite indication. Yesterday, they visited the French Consul-General on Rue de Consulat. Consul-General Bellion received them. He stated that he was not aware of the matter and had not signed the warrant for Cui Yingxin's arrest. After lawyers Lou and Xu explained the details of the arrest, the French Consul-General agreed to investigate and stated that if he had indeed been naturalized as Chinese, he should be protected according to the law. It has also been found that Cui Yingxin's naturalization certificate was seized by the French Municipal Police that day. Therefore, the family only knows the date of naturalization and cannot remember the number listed on the certificate. For the convenience of negotiation, Lawyer Lou and others have telegraphed the Ministry of Interior to provide a certified copy of Cui's naturalization process and requested that it be transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to lodge a protest. They have also sent letters to the Shanghai Bar Association requesting assistance.</p>

<p>The Norwegian "Kinnaird" ship, which sank several months ago due to a collision on the Pudong Lujiazui side of the Huangpu River, has been abandoned by the ship's company. The Customs authorities believe that the masts and smokestacks protruding above the water surface obstruct navigation. They had planned to salvage the ship, but due to the ship's large size, at least seven or eight large iron barges would be needed for buoyancy, and large machinery would be needed to lift it. However, the ship has been submerged for a long time. Even if it were salvaged and sold, the proceeds would not be enough to cover the salvage costs. Therefore, the Customs authorities have abandoned the salvage plan. The work of pumping water from each cabin with water pumps has also been stopped. The only remaining solution is to bomb it.</p>

<p>Tang Xiaolong, an eight-year-old girl from Yancheng, was betrothed to Ding Guangyou, a fellow villager living at No. 400 Magilu, a packer of rickshaws, several years ago by her parents as his future wife. During the January 28th Shanghai Incident, the girl's parents were both killed by stray bullets, so the girl was raised by her older siblings. Ding was allowed to bring the child to his home last year. In the first month of this year, the child suddenly became ill and died on the evening of the 30th of last month. Her older sister Jiang Tangshi (living at No. 12 Chang'an Road, Zhabei) heard about this and believed that her younger sister's death was caused by abuse by Ding and his wife. She reported this to the Gordon Road Police Station, which sent Chinese Detective Liu Chunshu to investigate and detained Ding Guangyou. The child's body was taken to the Renlu Forensic Examination Office. Yesterday morning, Guo Wei, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the office to examine the body. The Western policeman first reported the previous incident and stated that Ding Guangyou had requested detention. Ding Guangyou confessed that he was 33 years old, and the deceased was his future wife and cousin. She was sent to his home by her brother last year, and she was already very thin when she came. In the first month of this year, she suddenly became ill and was bedridden. He had hired a doctor to treat her, but it was ineffective, and she died. She was both his future wife and his sister's daughter, so he treated her very well and there was no abuse. The two broken skin areas on her buttocks were caused by lying in bed for a long time and rubbing against the sheets. The older sister, Jiang Tangshi, stated that she was 17 years old and the deceased was her younger sister. She was sent to Ding's house by her second brother last year. After arriving at his house, Ding and his wife abused her younger sister very severely, often beating her, not allowing her to eat enough, and there were two bruises on her buttocks as proof. Last year, when she met her, she told her that she was being abused. Now she does not know how she died, so she is requesting justice and a detailed examination. Guo Jun stated that he could not determine the cause of death from the deceased's appearance. He ordered that an autopsy should be performed, and the hearing would be adjourned. The body was handed over to the older sister, Jiang Tangshi, to prepare the coffin.</p>

<h3 id="e171">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully, according to the person involved, Zhang Weiliang, the news published on the 30th of this month about dentist Zhang Weiliang being accused of assaulting his wife is completely inconsistent with the facts. He requested that I write a letter on his behalf to make a correction. Zhang Weiliang and Zhang Dong had a family quarrel over trivial matters in February of this year, but there was no physical violence or assault. After Zhang Dong's side misunderstood and filed a lawsuit, the First Special District Court advised them to withdraw the case. At that time, this lawyer defended Zhang Weiliang and witnessed the settlement of the case. Since then, Zhang Weiliang has not resented this. When Zhang Dong was due to give birth, Zhang Weiliang was still fully responsible for taking care of everything and providing expenses. On the 18th of last month, another lawsuit was filed due to other reasons. In fact, it was still a misunderstanding on the part of Zhang Dong, and the details were minor. There were no facts as reported in your newspaper. Fearing that readers would not know the truth and would affect Zhang Weiliang's personal reputation, I am sending this special request to be published in your newspaper to make a correction. To the Editor of Shenbao, Lawyer Shen Junru, April 1st.</p>

<p>The total number of yarn factories in the country this year is 136, with 92 Chinese factories, 41 Japanese factories, and 3 British factories. The number of spindles is 4,731,146, an increase of 119,789 spindles compared to the previous year. Among them, Chinese factories account for 2,742,754 spindles, accounting for 57.97%, and the increase in spindles is 105,341, accounting for 87.9% of the total increase. There are a total of 440,434 thread spindles, of which Chinese factories account for 143,024 spindles (32.47%). There are a total of 42,834 looms, of which Chinese factories account for 20,926 looms (48.85%), all of which have increased compared to 1933. Although the environment is not good, in order to survive, the yarn factories can only struggle with perseverance. The trend of shutdowns or reduced work has not decreased due to the increase in the number of spindles. According to the statistics of the Yarn Factory Association, the number of spindles shut down in the first half of this year increased by 104,933 spindles compared to the second half of last year, and the shutdown time was about four weeks. Reduced work has increased, and inventory has decreased. At the same time, yarn prices have fallen, and transactions are still booming. The total for the year is 319,923 bales, an increase of 334.87% compared to the previous year.</p>

<p>(2) Silk Industry The silk industry was the most sluggish this year. Taking Shanghai as an example, of the original 112 silk reeling factories, only two barely started work at the beginning of the year due to the decline in the silk market. When the spring cocoons started, the overseas silk market showed some activity, and the silk factories gradually started work, but only 33. During August and September, the overseas silk market plummeted, and Japanese silk was actively devalued, and silk prices became more sluggish. After the silver export tax was levied, there was a brief period of excitement, but it was also sluggish due to poor sales. At the end of the year, only 15 or 16 factories were operating. In other places, such as Wuxi, the most prosperous time this year was no more than 33 factories, and only ten or so factories were operating in Xiaoshan, Jiaxing, Haining, and other places. The situation in Sichuan and Guangdong was also declining, and the scene was bleak. The silk weaving industry shared the same fate. Taking Shanghai as an example, there were still 387 silk factories in 1933, with more than 4,780 looms. This year, only about 300 factories were struggling to maintain operations, with 2,500 looms, a decrease of about one-half. Bankruptcies of silk and satin shops were also heard from time to time. The decline of the silk industry can be seen in general. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Tang Jiapeng, formerly known as Tang Ayu, the manager of the Great World amusement park in Ningbo, was ambushed and shot to death by thugs hired by his enemies at around 1:00 AM on June 17th, 1933 (i.e., the morning of the 18th), as he was leaving the Great World with three or four friends and about to board his car. At the same time, a passerby, Wu Guangcai from Yangzhou, a bathhouse attendant, was killed by stray bullets. The murderers fled the scene immediately. Two months later, the Special Bureau of the French Concession police arrested two accomplices, Zhang Tinggui (nicknamed Xiao Sizi) from Funing and Zhao Guangfu from Yangzhou, in various locations on Haifang Road in western Shanghai, and recovered the Browning pistol used to kill Tang. They were sent to the Second Special District Court for prosecution. After three trials, Zhang was sentenced to 20 years imprisonment and Zhao was sentenced to life imprisonment and sent to prison. Recently, the French police, based on a tip from the prisoner Zhao Guangfu, continued to pursue the main offender, Wang Xinggao (also known as Wang Xiaogao) from Funing (40 years old, residing at No. 46 Menggu Road, Zhabei), who was a detective in the Shanghai Public Security Bureau at the time, at 11:30 PM on December 13th of last year in Room 537 of the Central Hotel on Guangdong Road, with the assistance of Chief Detective Lang Boli, Chinese Detective Wang Rusong, and Detective Guo Shaorong. He was taken back to the police station, transferred to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. As a result, he was prosecuted for premeditated murder under Article 284 of the Criminal Code. Judge Xiong Huiping held several hearings to investigate the case and requested the Hubei Higher Court to investigate Wang's tenure as a warden at the Hubei First Prison in Wuchang. However, Wang consistently denied involvement in the murder and hired a lawyer to defend him. However, Zhao Guangfu testified in court that Wang was Wang Jinkui. Later, Judge Xiong was transferred to the Higher Third Branch Court, and Judge Sun Peng took over the case for renewed trial. Zhao Guangfu suddenly recanted, claiming that Wang had an affair with his mistress and he was framing him out of spite. However, Wang's family persuaded Zhao's wife to negotiate a settlement. In a letter that Zhao wrote to his wife in the detention center, teaching her about the settlement, the letter was intercepted by the authorities and submitted as evidence by the police. Witnesses were also gathered and interrogated, and the proceedings were concluded. The date for sentencing was set. As reported earlier, Judge Sun came to the First Criminal Court at 10:00 AM yesterday, ordered Wang Xinggao to be brought to the court, briefly questioned his name, age, and origin, and then announced the verdict. Wang Xinggao was sentenced to life imprisonment for instigating premeditated murder and was deprived of his civil rights for life. During the appeal period, the defendant will remain in custody in the detention center.</p>

<h3 id="e178">Various Organizations Write to the Public Works Bureau to Protest Telephone Price Increase, Requesting Consideration of Taxpayers' Interests and Cancellation of the Approved Price Increase Proposal <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The First and Second Special District Citizens' Union of this city, the National Goods Promotion League, and other organizations yesterday wrote to the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession and the Board of Directors of the French Concession to oppose the telephone price increase, and requested that they demand a reduction from the telephone company on behalf of the taxpayers based on the contract provisions. The original letter stated: "To whom it may concern, the Shanghai Telephone Company has recently requested your bureau to increase user fees starting from April 1st on the grounds of high expenses and insufficient dividends. Such unreasonable behavior is opposed by all users, both Chinese and foreign. Our associations believe that your bureau, as the highest authority in managing the administrative security of the concessions, should consider the interests of the taxpaying citizens and curb such absurd actions that violate the regulations of public utilities. However, we are disappointed that your bureau has listened to one-sided arguments and has essentially accepted the principle of changing the fee structure, even slightly. Telephones are a means of transportation and are related not only to the business of taxpaying citizens but also to public security matters such as police and fire services within the concessions. Although the company holds the authority to operate exclusively, it must still consider the interests of the public. The company's economic reasons, as it claims, are nothing more than the high cost of improving equipment and the failure to achieve a full dividend. However, the company should prepare for improving equipment and developing its business. If the expenses are too high, it should reduce usage fees so that the number of phones can gradually increase, and revenue can naturally increase. It is neither fair nor wise to have existing users bear the cost of equipment that has already been used. As a result, the number of users will inevitably decrease, and revenue will decrease. It is even more absurd to maintain a full dividend. At this time of global economic depression, the interest rates of various enterprises are declining daily, and the company's current operations can still maintain a net profit of more than 6%, which is more than double the interest rate set by national banks in Europe and the United States. Furthermore, the six types of preferred stock of the Shanghai Power Company, with a 6% interest rate, can serve as a precedent. In short, at a time when the social economy is extremely panicked and all industries are in a state of decline, the telephone prices that were set in the past are already considered expensive. We are trying to reduce the burden, so how can we increase it? Our association hopes that your bureau will prioritize the interests of the taxpaying citizens and not only consider the improper gains of a few people, which will incite public anger and lead to other complications. We also hope that you will demand a reduction in usage fees from the telephone company on behalf of the taxpaying citizens in accordance with Section 3 of Article 3 of the contract, and reconsider and cancel the approved price increase proposal to benefit commerce and promote justice. We eagerly await this. Sincerely, to the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, the Board of Directors of the French Concession, the First Special District Citizens' Union of Shanghai, the Second Special District Citizens' Union of Shanghai, the Shanghai National Goods Promotion League, the National Goods Factory Union, and the Citizens' National Goods Promotion Association."</p>

<p>Building Dams to Dredge the River, The Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Commission is building dams in Yujidun, Caijiazhai, and Beizhuangjing to dredge the Wusong River, and work began yesterday. However, the majority of rice in this city is supplied by Suzhou, Pingwang, Wuxi, Jiangyin, Yixing, Jiashan, Jiaxing, Songjiang, and other places. Except for Jiashan, Jiaxing, and Songjiang, which enter through the South Huangpu, Yujidun is a necessary route for rice boats from other places.</p>
<p>Rice Boats Detour, In normal times, rice boats from Suzhou and Wuxi come to Shanghai via Lujiabang, Sijiangkou, Huangdu, Yujidun, then through the inner Huangpu, Beixinjing, Zhangjiajing, and reach the Wusong River. Since the dam is built in Yujidun, ships must go from Sijiangkou to Baihegang, Qingpu, Songjiang, Minhang, and then detour to the northern city from the outer Huangpu (i.e., the Bund).</p>
<p>Rice Prices Soar, Because rice boats to Shanghai must detour due to the dam construction in Yujidun, only ten ships arrived in the northern city yesterday, twenty fewer than usual. In addition, rice stocks are empty, and rice prices soared by 4 to 5 jiao yesterday. The price of first-grade Changbang rice was 12 yuan and 6 jiao, an increase of 2 jiao, second-grade Xibang rice was 11 yuan and 8 jiao, an increase of 5 jiao, and third-grade Xuanxing rice was 11 yuan and 5 jiao, an increase of 5 jiao. Currently, due to the shortage of goods, prices are expected to remain high.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Another Police Officer Illegally Beats Someone, Wu Fulin Has Been Examined by the Court <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Following the horrifying case in which the Zhenru police station was found to have caused the death of Zhu Jianqiu, the owner of the Family Food Company, by forcibly injecting water into his nose, resulting in suffocation, and the court sentenced police chief Zhou Pingyuan and police officer Xing Guonong to ten years imprisonment each, another similar case of police brutality resulting in serious injury occurred the day before yesterday. The details are as follows: Wu Fulin, a resident of Dangtu, 45 years old, lives with his wife, Wang, and three children at No. 44 Yongqing West Lane, Roberts Road, Caojiadu. He works as a laborer at the Chengsheng Flower Factory. In 1931, he subleased No. 44, obtaining the qualifications of a second landlord, with a monthly rent of 11 yuan and 3 jiao. According to Wu, because he is illiterate, the rent collector, Mr. Li, successively filled in double rent tickets (two rent tickets per month) for five months. (These rent tickets, because other tenants also discovered double rent tickets and filed lawsuits in the District Court, have been submitted to the court as evidence.) On March 29th, at around 6:00 PM, Mr. Li brought the police to Wu Fulin's house, claiming that Wu was in arrears with his rent. The police arrested Wu and detained him at the Caojiadu police station until 11:00 AM on the 31st, when he was released, but he had already suffered injuries all over his body. Yesterday, Wu's wife, Wu Wang, carried her husband, Wu Fulin, to the prosecutor's office of the District Court, requesting an examination of his injuries. According to Wu Wang, after her husband was arrested by the police on the 29th, she sent food to the station but was refused. Later, after obtaining a business card from a certain prominent person, she was allowed to send food, but her husband had already gone hungry for a day. It was not until around 11:00 AM the day before yesterday (the 31st) that her husband was released, having been detained for two nights and beaten three times. In the last instance, Mr. Li was the first to attack, followed by three police officers who kicked him with wooden sticks or leather shoes, or punched him, even beating him out of the police station, causing injuries that left him unable to move. They also slapped him on both cheeks and struck his ears, even causing deafness. The most severe injuries were to his chest, with bruises all over his legs, indicating serious injuries. After the prosecutor examined him, he was instructed to return home for medical treatment and await further instructions.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Autopsy to Examine Bullets in Last Year's Jin Menggen Murder Case, Wang Xinshan Appeals Death Sentence, Corpse Turns Purplish-Black and Does Not Decompose <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Jin Menggen, who opened a tea shop in Zhoujiaqiao in western Shanghai, was shot and killed on the morning of April 30th of last year (lunar calendar) at around 5:00 AM while traveling through Hopeland Road. His wives, Jin Bao and Jin Liu, and witnesses testified that the main culprit was Wang Xinshan. After investigation, the District Court sentenced Wang Xinshan to death for premeditated murder. Wang refused to accept the sentence and appealed according to the law. He has been transferred to the Suzhou Higher Court. A hearing was held once, and Wang vehemently proclaimed his innocence. However, it was discovered that there was still a bullet in the deceased's body that had not been extracted at the time. Out of caution, Shao Qinzhi, the criminal judge of the District Court, previously ordered Jin Bao, the deceased's wife, to come to court for questioning last month to ask if she would be willing to have the coffin opened to extract the bullet to examine the bullet's style, which could prove which type of pistol was used. At that time, Jin Bao and others believed that her husband had suffered an unfortunate fate, and they were reluctant to have the coffin opened. The court reasoned that if the coffin was not opened for extraction, how could justice be served, so yesterday it ordered Jin Bao and Jin Liu to carry Jin Menggen's coffin to the Zhenru Forensic Institute to wait for the coffin to be opened. At noon, Judge Shao Qinzhi, along with court clerk and bailiff Zhu Zhiqi, personally visited the Zhenru Forensic Institute and ordered the laborers to open the coffin in accordance with the law. The forensic doctor extracted a bullet from the wound below Jin Menggen's throat and ordered the wives to re-examine the coffin. When the coffin was opened, the wives and concubines of the deceased were extremely distraught and could not help but weep. The corpse did not decompose, but it had turned purplish-black and dry. Because the corpse was wrapped in fabric and placed in a high-quality coffin, it did not easily decompose. Judge Shao Qinzhi asked the family of the deceased a few questions and then returned by car.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Fire on the Wuyang Steamer, Losses Not Significant <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>After the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Wuyang steamer arrived in Shanghai, it was docked at the company's No. 4 pier in Ao Jia Du, Pudong. At around 7:30 PM last night, a burning clump of coal ash suddenly shot out from the steamer's chimney and landed on the canvas of a lifeboat on the deck, immediately igniting a fire. Because no one noticed at the time, the flames spread. The deck was ablaze. A sailor spotted it, immediately rang the bell to raise the alarm, and telegraphed the fire department for assistance. Zhao, the director of the Pudong Fire Department, led his team to the scene in a fire truck to put out the fire. The customs fireboat also arrived shortly after. The fire was extinguished in a short time. One lifeboat, one ventilation window, and approximately one zhang of the platform deck were destroyed.</p>

<p>At around 10:00 AM on February 20th of this year, the compradore of the French Business Water and Electricity Company at No. 249 Luban Road, Tu Jinsheng, ordered a cash delivery of 20,000 yuan in silver to be deposited in the bank. Just after he carried it out the door and stepped onto the car, four robbers with guns rushed up and robbed a bag of 4,000 yuan and escaped by car. The French police were notified to investigate. It was not until the evening of the 17th of last month that the French police's Special Bureau's Inspector Jin Jiulin led detectives Zhang Ziying, Qian Yumin, Cai Jinzhang, Zhou Buguang, and patrol detectives to arrest the ringleader and accomplices Yang Yang, Qiu Yanshou, Zhao Zhongheng, Li Zhongxin, Zhu Hanqiang, Pan Yuqing, Liu Shaogen, Zhang Debiao, Fan Youheng, Ren Shaogen, Zhang Yun, Pan Yibang, Zhou Kui, Zhou Lu, Xia Wenfu, Xu Richeng, and Xu Defu, a total of seventeen men and women, at No. 25 Dafang Lane, Fangbang Bridge, No. 34 Derun Lane, Chezhan Road, No. 480 Fangxie Road, and Anshun Lane on Kangti Road and No. 381 Ai Duya Road, New Dafang Hotel, and other places in the Chinese area. Two pistols and sixteen bullets were confiscated and sent to the Second Special District Court for interrogation and investigation. As reported earlier, Judge Sun Peng, along with court clerk Tao Zongkan, came to the First Criminal Court to interrogate them at 10:00 AM yesterday. They first questioned each person's name, age, and origin. Then, according to the police lawyer Yao Zhaodi, because there were many defendants in this case and the case was complicated, the investigation procedures had not yet been completed. He requested an extension of two weeks to investigate the details of the case and file a lawsuit. The court reviewed the report and decided to reschedule the hearing for 10:00 AM on April 10th. The defendants were returned to custody separately. It is rumored that the defendants committed many crimes in the concession, so the police investigation is taking a long time.</p>

<p>Cai Songchun and Cai Bochun, sons of Cai Yousheng, a gynecological expert and national doctor in Jiangwan, are also doctors, practicing medicine on Huaji Road in Hongkou. Recently, they diagnosed Chen Jiang, a woman from Wuxi who was three months pregnant, as having irregular menstruation and used menstruation-inducing drugs such as Pinellia and Tetrapanax Paper, causing her to miscarry. The woman hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Cai Songchun and Bochun in the First Special District Court for negligence causing injury under Article 301 of the Criminal Code. After two hearings, they were instructed to submit an expert opinion from the Shanghai National Doctors Association for further review. As reported earlier, Judge Xiang Yinghua held a continued hearing at the Ninth Criminal Court yesterday afternoon. The two defendants and their lawyer, Lu Qi, also attended. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the plaintiff's side discovered that both defendants were members of the National Doctors Association and that their father was influential in the association, so their expert opinion would inevitably be biased. Therefore, he requested that the expert opinion be transferred. He did not know if the request had been received and submitted a copy of the "Essentials of Materia Medica" for reference, as the book states that both Pinellia and Tetrapanax Paper are forbidden for pregnant women. Judge Xiang stated that experts should sign individual pledges in accordance with the law, and if there is any perjury, they should be subject to perjury penalties, so the request for transfer should not be considered. The defendant's lawyer, Lu, also presented multiple books of medicine to prove that Pinellia and Tetrapanax Paper can indeed be used for pregnant women. The court then issued the expert opinion, the results of which were favorable to the defendants. After reviewing the opinion, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the opinion was biased, which was what the plaintiff expected, and requested consideration. Judge Xiang deemed the facts clear and ordered the start of the debate. After the lawyers debated, the court declared the debate concluded and scheduled the sentencing for 2:00 PM next Monday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Special District Rickshaw Business Asks to Stop Paying Mutual Aid Fee as Agreed, Eight-Month Period Expired, Yesterday Contacted Public Works Bureau, New Rickshaw Bodies Bulky, Coolies Unwilling to Pull <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>The Public Concession Rickshaw Committee collects a mutual aid fee of 1 yuan and 5 jiao per rickshaw per month. Because the rickshaw business and the Public Works Bureau agreed on August 6th of last year to an eight-month period, which has now expired, and the Public Works Bureau has not yet stopped collecting the fee, the rickshaw business believes that it is unbearable. Therefore, yesterday, a special representative requested the Public Works Bureau to stop collecting the fee in accordance with the agreement. At the same time, after 131 new rickshaws were driven, the coolies still expressed their opposition because the rickshaw bodies were too heavy and difficult to pull. The Rickshaw Committee and the Examination Office convened the coolies together with the rickshaw business representative Gu Songmao to inquire about the situation. As a result, the coolies unanimously stated that they were too heavy and no one was willing to pull them. According to a Xin Sheng News Agency reporter, the Rickshaw Committee believes that the matter is difficult to implement, so it has decided to exchange these new models. The rickshaw business has also designed a new rickshaw and submitted it to the Rickshaw Committee for adoption. As for the mutual aid fee, the rickshaw owners are still continuing to collect it and deposit it in the bank. At the same time, they plan to hold a meeting to negotiate. If the negotiation is ineffective, they will stop paying the fee starting next month.</p>

<p>(Tokyo Correspondence) Japanese schools have long discriminated against Chinese students, either refusing them admission or establishing special admission procedures for foreigners, indiscriminately accepting Chinese students. The Superintendent's Office for Students Studying in Japan has repeatedly requested improvements from the Japanese authorities regarding this situation, but without result. Zhou Xianwen, the superintendent for students studying in Japan, in view of this, specially hosted prominent figures from the Japanese cultural community at the East Asia Tongwen Society on the 31st of last month. After explaining the current situation of Chinese students studying in Japan in detail, he requested that the following two points be promoted to encourage the Japanese government to realize them as soon as possible: (1) The Japanese side should treat Chinese and Japanese students equally. If some schools do not admit Chinese students, it is not hoped for. If some schools indiscriminately admit Chinese students, they are not welcome. (2) China's various study abroad regulations should be adapted to the Japanese education system, and at the same time, the Japanese side is expected to consider China's legal system in its facilities for Chinese students.</p>

<p>Releasing a Declaration Shanghai Children's Welfare Association, Children's Film Committee, and Moonlight Grand Theater jointly organized Children's Film Day. They released the following declaration: The 20th century is the century of children. If we don't mind being arbitrary, then we can also say this: the future of film should be the film of children, because only with new children can there be a new country. But if we want to hope for new children, first we must have the tools to create new children. There are naturally many tools to create new children, but we believe that the most effective is film. Future education should be centered on film. The inventor of film, Edison, has already told us this. However, although film is a tool for creating new children, it can also have a bad effect on children. For example, in Europe, films are often the things that create bad teenagers. It is common to see bad teenagers who have escaped from reformatories in movie theaters. Investigating the reasons for their escape, it is actually due to their love of film. Therefore, those who care about education and study the protection of children must have a deep understanding of the issue of children's films. Various countries in Europe and America have special regulations for children to watch films, stipulating the screening time and requiring them to go with their parents. For example, in various cities in Germany, children under the age of six are absolutely not allowed to watch films (as stipulated in Article 2 of the German Film Law). Also, children aged 14 to 18 must be accompanied by their parents to enter the venue. Similarly, the restrictions in England, the United States, Denmark, Sweden, and Italy are also very strict. Needless to say, the reason they are so restrictive is to prevent children's bad behavior. Furthermore, there are two reasons for this. On the one hand, because film is loved by children, they can use their imitative nature in this kind of setting to cultivate their desire for goodness. On the other hand, from a health perspective, for example, in England, films are shown once a week for an hour or more to children aged 14 to 17 to help their development. Our country does not seem to pay much attention to this issue, so there are often cries from babies and shouts from teenagers in movie theaters. This phenomenon is really not appropriate. Human imitation is most developed in childhood. If considerable restrictions are not placed on the viewing of films, then all kinds of bad actions on the film will be imitated one by one without realizing it. Taking Shanghai as an example, although there are more than 40 large and small movie theaters, the films they show are mostly of the love, martial arts, and detective genres, so after children watch them, they unconsciously cultivate theft behavior or lewd thoughts. Some people say that school education in Shanghai has failed to achieve full effect because it has been influenced by bad films. This is really not an overstatement. In view of this, the Children's Welfare Committee has specially invited all parties concerned to organize a Children's Film Committee to study and discuss the film issue. With the consent of the Moonlight Grand Theater, special days have been designated for children to watch films, called Children's Film Day. On these designated days, films that are suitable for children's needs and beneficial to their physical and mental health are shown in order to truly seek some benefits for them. We hope that this will expand from Moonlight to movie theaters throughout the city and even the country, and that there will be such regulations.

<p>The Shanghai Municipal Education Association yesterday presented a petition to the Municipal Education Bureau requesting it to forward it to the Ministry of Education to unify textbooks for primary and secondary schools nationwide. The original petition is extracted below: Petition to request the Ministry of Education to unify textbooks for primary and secondary schools nationwide. It is noted that whether school education can produce good results is closely related to the textbooks used. However, since the Revolution, textbooks for various subjects in primary and secondary schools have been used in a mixed manner, with no uniform standard. As a result, School A uses the Commercial Press version, School B uses the Zhonghua version, this year the World version is used, and next year the Kaihu version is used. Even within the same school, the textbooks used for each subject are different, and teachers of the same grade have different choices. The resulting malpractices are that students have uneven levels and have difficulty connecting, and teachers and school authorities also find it difficult to decide due to the complexity of the versions. For this reason, the inability of primary and secondary school education to foresee a revival, although there are many reasons, the lack of uniformity in textbooks is the main crux of the problem. In view of this, the association proposed a discussion at the ninth council meeting, and it was unanimously agreed that the unification of textbooks for primary and secondary schools is a matter of urgent importance. It was decided unanimously to present this petition to your bureau in the name of the association, requesting it to be forwarded to the Ministry of Education. (1) Textbooks should be unified nationwide and edited by the National Compilation and Translation Bureau as soon as possible. (2) Reference books for each subject can be freely compiled and do not need to be restricted. (3) If due to printing reasons, it can be entrusted to a bookstore for joint printing, etc. These principles have been recorded. This matter concerns the teaching efficiency of primary and secondary schools. It should be recorded and presented to your esteemed chief for review, and it is hoped that it will be forwarded to the Ministry of Education for approval and implementation, which would be in the public interest.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Great China University Agrees to Reduce Holidays and Shorten the Academic Year; Also Proposes Seven Prerequisites <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>The proposal to shorten the academic year and reduce holidays submitted by Central Committee Member Sun Ke and others to the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Committee has been resolved by the Central Political Conference. The Ministry of Education has issued an order to various universities to conduct academic research on the matter. Some universities in the north have opposed it, and the reasons have been seen in the newspapers. It is now heard that Great China University in this city has also received the order. President Wang convened a discussion meeting the other day, and Vice President Ou Yuanhuai presented a written opinion, which was modified slightly by Dean of Academic Affairs Lu Jizeng, Dean of the College of Education Tai Shuangqiu, Dean of the College of Arts Wu Zelin, Director of the Teachers College Tong Yinian, Director of the Affiliated Middle School Ni Wenya, Professor Chen Yibai, and others, who contributed their opinions. It was sent to the Ministry on the 28th for reference. In principle, the written opinion generally agrees to the issues of reducing holidays and shortening the academic year, but has several prerequisites attached to the implementation. The full text is tens of thousands of words long. The main points are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Main Points of Opinion (1) The Issue of Textbook and Time Allocation From the perspective of the curriculum and time allocation of schools at all levels, the length of the academic year is certainly an issue, but a more important issue is how to utilize teaching time. (2) The Issue of the Length of the School System Looking at the current school systems in various countries around the world and the changes in the school system in China over the past 30 years, the length of the school system varies. There is no unified and fixed method. As long as it is needed for the current class environment, there is room for expansion and contraction. (3) The Issue of the Increase or Decrease of Holidays Over the Years The dates of holidays in our country have changed considerably from the founding of the Republic of China to the present. This indicates that there is a lot of room for holiday activity and that there is a tendency to reduce them. (4) The Value of Holidays in Education In theory, holidays have considerable educational value, but in reality, students often fail to utilize holidays or even waste their studies and develop bad habits. (5) The Issue of the Impact of Hot and Cold Weather on Teaching According to the research of Thorndike, if we can encourage students to work hard, then the results of working in hot, humid, stale, and stagnant air are the same as working in ideal conditions. Furthermore, the academic performance of summer schools in the past has been excellent, and there have been no health problems.</p>
<p>Prerequisites (1) Middle School Subjects Are Too Heavy and Class Hours Are Too Long Instead of shortening the academic year, it is better to take the extra time from reducing the holidays and allocate it to supplementary teaching every week to make the student's burden lighter and the content of the course more skilled. (2) Pay Attention to Student Internships and Social Contact Because the holidays are shortened, students have fewer opportunities to contact society. The school should stipulate a certain amount of time each semester and incorporate student internships to prevent them from becoming isolated from society. (3) The government should pay attention to the issue of graduates' career prospects Because the academic year is shortened, there will be more graduates each year, and the issue of career prospects will naturally be more difficult to resolve. (4) The administrative management equipment and the age of admission for schools at all levels must be re-standardized in order to achieve sound and reasonable operation. For teachers, salaries should be increased, seniority-based pay increases and retirement benefits should be implemented, and the number of teachers should be increased to allow them to take turns taking one day off a week, or several months off every one or two years to continue their studies. If the two departments of high school and middle school are changed to a semester system, this would be easier to do. (9) More room for flexibility should be left to local areas. The best way to handle winter and summer holidays is to stipulate that a few days off will be granted when the temperature and humidity reach a certain degree, otherwise no holidays will be granted. (6) As for the implementation steps, it is best to have the Ministry of Education designate a few universities, middle schools, and elementary schools in the north and south to conduct trials first. If the results of the trials are indeed successful, then expand it to general schools. (7) It is also a way to shorten the academic year by acknowledging the credits of night schools and summer schools. It is heard that Ou Yuanhuai's written opinion will be published in the May issue of the Education Magazine to seek advice from colleagues in the education community.</p>

<p>The Shen Bao Extracurricular School attached to this newspaper, in response to requests from all walks of life, has decided to trial run a day school this semester. Enrollment has been open for many days, but due to insufficient numbers, it has been decided to open English and Arithmetic classes. Classes will officially start on April 10th. A notice has been sent to the registered students as follows: Dear Sir/Madam, Our school has been trial running a day class this semester. Enrollment has been open for a long time, but all classes have not been fully enrolled. However, time waits for no one, and the summer vacation will soon be here, so we must urgently seek to open the school. Therefore, we convened all the registered students to the school for a discussion on March 30th and decided that "the English and Arithmetic classes will be opened first this semester (the other classes will not be opened). From April 10th to July 10th, the English class will be held from 1:00 PM to 2:20 PM, and the Arithmetic class will be held from 2:40 PM to 4:00 PM (a total of three full months and thirteen weeks, with classes held six days a week from Monday to Saturday, and each subject taught for 80 minutes each day, which is equivalent to 125 hours in ordinary schools). As for the teaching methods, the English class will have the teacher select a Chinese article each day and translate it into English in the classroom in a discussion format. It is hoped that in this short period of time, all the points that should be paid attention to when writing in English can be raised step by step. This teaching method is expected to be of great help to high school students. In addition to teaching algebra in an orderly manner from simultaneous linear equations, the Arithmetic class will also assign a book of geometry and trigonometry each as extracurricular reading, and set aside 30 minutes each day in class to study them." It is sent to you by special letter. Those who wish to join, please come to the school to pay the fees within the three days of April 2nd, 3rd, and 4th (14.5 yuan for one subject, 28.5 yuan for two subjects, and the previously paid registration fee can be used to offset the tuition). If you do not wish to join, please come to the school within the above three days to collect your registration fee in order to close the matter.</p>

<p>The sixth annual Industry and Commerce Amateur Football Tournament held at the City First Sports Field saw the "Living Character" group achieve particularly excellent results. The Xintai and Postal Workers teams were especially outstanding. Xintai only lost to Jinde, winning all other matches.

<p>In the first half, Xintai took advantage of the wind, launching relentless attacks. The Postal Workers' center-back, Shu Zhuping, defended resolutely, thwarting all efforts. Xintai then advanced down the wing, with the right-winger unleashing a fierce shot at the goal, finding the net. Despite conceding a goal, the Postal Workers did not lose heart. The forwards coordinated effectively, and soon after, Postal Workers' center-half, Bao Boyu, returned the favor with a shot from 20 yards, leveling the score. The first half ended in a 1-1 draw. After the lemon break, the teams switched sides and resumed play. With the championship at stake, both sides were determined to win, leading to intense competition. The Postal Workers capitalized on their rapid sprints and accurate passing, often dominating Xintai's territory. Shortly after, Xu Xin and Zheng Wenkui scored two consecutive goals. Xintai refused to give in, launching counter-attacks. Postal Workers' center-back, Hu Guisen, committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick, which was successfully converted. Xintai's momentum gradually increased, but the referee blew the whistle, ending the game. The Postal Workers triumphed over their strong Shanghai West rivals, Xintai, with a 3-2 victory, claiming the championship and celebrating their win. The champion team lineup is as follows:</p>

<p>— (Zhou Tingfang)</p>
<p>Wine is indeed a valuable medicine at times, but it can also be a potent temptation. The great English playwright Shakespeare has a few wonderful lines cursing wine: "O that men should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance, revel, and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!"</p>
<p>However, the harm of wine is only the more obvious kind. Other things like opium and red pills are even more like "putting an enemy in their mouths," as Shakespeare said. Linghu Zhao</p>

<p>The benefits of exploration are infinite. Christopher Columbus was able to discover the New World because he had the spirit of exploration. This is the best example. Conservatism can often lead to the decline of a nation, while risky advancement can make a nation prosper. European and American nations are the most adventurous and progressive, and it can be seen that the strength of their countries is not without reason.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that Mount Everest in the Himalayas is the highest peak in the world, about 29,141 feet high. It is covered with snow all year round, and the cold is bone-chilling. It is a place where living things cannot live. Cowardly people would never dare to go up and explore, but European and American explorers have a kind of stubbornness to do something that they clearly know they cannot do, and often want to explore the Himalayas. There have been several expeditions to the Himalayas so far, but each time, in addition to sacrificing several lives, no concrete results have been obtained.</p>
<p>Recently, I heard that another "1935 French Himalayan Mountaineering Team" led by Mr. Aisijiala will explore from this year. Don't they care about the lessons of the past? Don't they cherish their precious lives? No, they dare to do this great act because they are driven by the spirit of risky advancement. This spirit is very worthy of our admiration.</p>

<p>Whenever I come to Shanghai from home and walk through Baoshan Road, which has been ravaged by war and become desolate and remote, I always encounter such a fellow: wearing an old and dirty Western suit, because there is no lining shirt inside, the rough and hairy muscles seem to be about to emerge from the cracks and holes. His cheeks are full of yellow and stiff beards, reflecting his rolling blue eyes, which are so frightening. When he sees someone passing by, he first gives you a salute, and then says in imperfect Chinese, "Sir, one copper, thank you!" This fellow is Luo Zhu Ah Da, whom everyone in Shanghai knows, also known as Russian Loafer. I am not a passive philanthropist like a Buddhist grandmother, and I am usually unwilling to give alms to beggars; only when I see this foreign exile, I cannot help but give him a little, so he recognizes me as his old customer. Every time he sees me, he puts on a smiling face, salutes, and waits quietly for my copper coin to be thrown into his tattered felt hat.</p>
<p>One day, I ran into him again, but I happened to have no copper coins with me, so I took out a small silver dollar and gave it to him, and told him, "I won't give you any more this month." He nodded, and indeed for several weeks, he never stretched out his hand when he saw me passing by.</p>
<p>One evening, I walked through Baziqiao. There are many houses there that were destroyed by artillery fire and have not been rebuilt. Some lead sheets are supported on the broken walls and ruins, which have become the comfortable nest of the beggars. I saw that Luo Song Ah Da was also sitting high inside, taking out the harvest he had gained during the day, ordering the little beggar to buy shochu and side dishes, as if he was treating guests. And many Chinese beggars also took out cigarette butts and asked him to smoke, with a friendly attitude, which also eliminated racial and national prejudices!</p>

<p>Bitterly recall old Wang's bibulous friend. How has his drinking been recently? Who knew that after one parting three years ago, he would be separated from the mortal world forever.</p>
<p>Half an acre of garden is desolate, and old wishes are empty. The world is vast, and I feel separated from my home. I can't forget drinking in the building outside the embrace. The last time we tasted sweet and sour fish together. (At the West Lake Exposition, we drank together on the lake. Luchun had jaundice and did not eat fish. I said, "Are you afraid of death? I think we are immortal and can endure suffering." Luchun understood and ate two more fish.)</p>
<p>His lacquer script is more wonderful than Jin Dongsou. His pastel copies are better than Yun Shouping. He owes me thirty years of poetic and drinking debts, which are now all unpaid.</p>
<p>Cai Yi has a daughter who can pass on his legacy. Deng Bo has no son and can only listen to fate. I say that life is originally a dream. Why distinguish between chickens, dogs, and immortals? (Luchun has no son but has a daughter named Ziyue, who is named Jin Guan. Now the obituary has a grandson, who is probably the son of the daughter. The system of clan peaches is no longer valued in this era, but the meaning of loving relatives is not extinguished. This is one breath of our nation's survival. Those who do not regard each other as Qin and Yue all rely on this.)</p>

<p>Chapter 11: Night Talk of a Sad Life, Originally a Dream, Footprints Scattered, Wind and Rain Too Deceptive</p>
<p>Jia Duocai listened to her words and was also dazed. At this time, he recovered his consciousness after drinking tea. The kerosene lamp on the table was probably set with a short wick and could not fully absorb the oil, so the flame was not very bright, and the shadows of people were somewhat blurred. Especially the tragic sound of the wind was blowing outside the wall again, which added to the unhappiness in people's hearts. He was silent, and Yang Huanhua was even more silent. After Jia Duocai finished drinking the cup of tea, Huanhua said to him: "Mr. Jia, think about it, what kind of life am I living? Thinking about the fate of others, how dare I live this life down? I dare not say the word 'marry someone.' If anyone goes south and is short of people to serve, I can serve him to Jiangnan. When I get to Jiangnan, I don't want anyone to pay my wages. I am willing to go home myself." Jia Duocai felt that the conditions she said were so low that it made her even more pitiful. So he said to her: "The opportunity you are talking about is not so difficult. I will pay attention to it with you." Huanhua said: "I also know very well that people like me are not worthy of Mr. Jia's eyes. She said to herself, and her face turned red. Jia Duocai scratched his head and smiled. You are too polite. Think about it, we can't take advantage of people in danger. Fortunately... fortunately, we..." He really couldn't find a suitable sentence to continue, so he just scratched his head. Yang Huanhua tightened her face and interjected: "I am not such a confused person. I am embarrassed to say this. I know that Mr. Jia likes the girl from Gansu very much. I have nothing to curry favor with you, so I will rent you as a ready-made matchmaker tomorrow. Originally, only women can know women's thoughts. If I say a few words according to what is in their hearts, it may be easier to succeed. There is nothing else to say. After drinking your wedding wine in the future, I will serve your new wife back to the south." (271)</p>

<p>As for the colors dyed on the silk, they were worth boasting about by the Empress Dowager! She not only used all the various colors in the world, but also divided each color into dozens of shades, from dark to light. For example, the color "green" was dyed into dark green in the first twist, and then gradually faded, from grass green, tender green, lake green, to the lightest; this lightest twist was already as pale as white. This project seemed to be not very difficult, but in reality it was extremely difficult. The girls used all their energy to do it. However, when they were dried, dozens or hundreds of colors gathered together, and when they were illuminated by the bright sunlight, they were extremely beautiful. If you look at them for a while, your eyes will surely be dizzy!</p>
<p>I still remember very clearly the first time I followed the Empress Dowager to visit.</p>
<p>As usual, dozens of dyed silks were drying in the stone square. The Empress Dowager first looked at them roughly, and then walked to a pole of blue silk, starting from the deepest twist and carefully looking at it gradually. At this time, the girls were already kneeling on the ground, waiting silently for the old lady to speak. Because she often criticized them for how the dyeing was not good, how the drying was not good; or she would also express her own opinions on improving the dyeing method. Of course, the opinions she expressed verbally were as irresistible as the written imperial edict; although dyeing silk was a small matter, in the eyes of these silk-making craftsmen, it was a matter of great importance.

<p>Massage therapy is especially prominent with one-finger Zen, and its effectiveness sometimes surpasses that of medicine. As far as I know, there is a one-finger Zen massage doctor named Huang Yizhao on South Chengdu Road in Shanghai. He is the son of the famous doctor Huang Hanru. He has a profound family knowledge and is good at treating stubborn diseases. He has a very precise understanding of pulse principles and deeply researches the source of diseases, so his treatment has many miraculous effects. The daughter of Mr. Wang Xifan, the younger cousin of the former Minister of Foreign Affairs, Dr. Wang Zhengting, was physically weak. Last winter, she suddenly suffered from scrofula under her right ribs. At the beginning, she was treated with medicine by doctors, but it gradually grew larger in a few days, and the area became harder. She could not turn her neck and had chills and fever. Later, through the introduction of his friend Mr. Zongxun, Mr. Huang was invited to treat her. The chills and fever completely subsided in two or three days, and her neck moved as usual in ten days, and the affected area was more than half smaller. In about three weeks, she had fully recovered. The author Huang and his son have written Huang's Medical Talks. I have always had a copy, which describes in detail the functions of one-finger Zen massage. Reading his book, I know that the medical skills of Huang and his son have an incredible mystery.</p>

<p>— Wu Jiren</p>
<p>Last Saturday afternoon, Mr. Zheng Xiaoqiu suddenly became happy and invited me to take a trip to Zhabei. We took his car to the area of Song Park Road and Zhijiang Temple. Mr. Zhu Chun, of Liuchun Goldfish Garden, had just returned to Wuxi, so we missed him. However, we did meet Mr. He, who lives in the garden and is extremely fascinated by goldfish. No matter how well he raises fish at home, the air and sunlight are ultimately not as good as at Liuchun Garden. He and Mr. Zhuang share the same interests. Coincidentally, the landlord was building a new house, so he moved here to be with thousands of ornamental fish morning and evening, laughing and chatting among them. I know his heart must be very happy, perhaps even more than being a ruler in the south.</p>
<p>Mr. He guided us around Liuchun Garden once. The scale and facilities are the best in Shanghai. Xiaoqiu chose to buy four "Looking to the Sky" goldfish and four calico goldfish, satisfied with the prices. Then we went to the Ma family's fish farm. The owner is from the north and his breeding of ball goldfish and coarser breeds is quite remarkable. However, he does not pay much attention to delicate breeds like pearlscales, bubble eyes, and upturned gills. The climate and customs of the north and south are different, and the water and soil also affect the nature of the fish. Therefore, fish breeders have each developed their own specialties. Less than a hundred steps from the Ma family's farm is a fish garden run by the martial arts star Mr. Zha Ruilong himself. The facilities are quite good, but unfortunately, he used his staff poorly, and it is in a state of disrepair. Even the fish are not many anymore. I heard that Mr. Zha sacrificed thousands of gold coins.</p>
<p>On the way back. After walking less than three hundred steps, Mr. He pointed out a new fish garden that was under construction, with digging the ground to make ponds and turning the soil to install tanks. In less than two months, we will be able to see many lively fish chasing each other among the green algae.</p>
<p>At the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Wharf, where we were seeing off Zhou Hu as he went abroad, I met the owner of the "Violet" and we talked about goldfish. He told me that in the first month of this year, several five- or six-year-old violet orchid goldfish developed frostbite (see note below) due to the long period of rainy weather. He displayed them in a washbasin, exposing them to sunlight. One day, he was careless and the neighbor's cat stole and devoured them. Such five- or six-year-old violet orchid goldfish are rare even in Suzhou, not to mention elsewhere. The owner must be very upset.</p>
<p>I haven't seen Mr. Zhang Mengzhou for almost half a year, and I haven't visited his Lin She Fish Garden on Xietu Road for a long time. Xiaoqiu suggested we visit, so we drove there. The bamboo fence was neatly arranged and the new house was completed. The three rooms facing south were bright and clean. The tanks and ponds were planned in an orderly manner. Compared to the humble beginnings of the past year, it was like two completely different places. I recall when I was establishing the Fish Paradise, I ran around for several months and managed things, but in the end, due to disagreements, I let Mr. So-and-so take over. Therefore, Mr. Zhang's hard work can be imagined. If fish had consciousness, they would surely multiply new breeds to dance for Mr. Zhang! I laugh.</p>
<p>My younger brother, Baozhi, has also recently developed a fondness for fish. He has installed more than twenty tanks in the courtyard. He has collected about ten species. In addition to a gardener changing the water, he does the feeding himself every morning. Last summer, nearly ten thousand small fish hatched. Unfortunately, there was a drought, and the well water was scarce. As a result, it was very difficult to get water, and the fish died one after another. When the rain finally came, the few remaining small fish did not grow very large. When I visited home at the end of the year, I saw breeds such as upturned gills, jade tiger heads, etc., which were still quite impressive.</p>
<p>(Note) Frostbite is when the fish's body develops small white spots, including the gills. In severe cases, it turns into white patches. The cause of the disease is prolonged cloudy days with little sunlight. The cure is to expose the fish to strong sunlight. Mr. Dong Tianya, the set design director of the Star Film Company, used scientific treatment two years ago, using five thousand candlepower electric lights to irradiate the fish, and the fish were cured. However, be extra careful when irradiating, and pay special attention to the water temperature.</p>

<p>**Sharp Short Squeeze, Strong Buying Interest, Biao Jin Soars, Closing Price Breaks the 900 Yuan Mark**</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was driven by strong buying interest as major players like Tong Fengheng aggressively covered their positions, and the Tenger also fueled the market. A short squeeze formed, and the price surged. At the same time, many hedgers painfully closed their positions. Bank exchange rates were unusually tight, once breaking the 900 yuan mark.</p>
<p>In the morning, overseas gold markets rose across the board. The price of deferred silver in Montry also rose by 7 to 9.5 percentage points. Exchange rates contracted across the board. The price of raw gold in London rose by one shilling and five pence. In off-exchange preliminary trading, the opening price immediately dropped to 74.5 yuan, with supply and demand balancing, resulting in a narrow fluctuation range.</p>
<p>The Central Bank's posted exchange rates in the morning showed both British and American rates rising. Customs gold units increased by 6 percentage points. The standard price of Biao Jin rose to 906.3 yuan. After the opening, the price rebounded. Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu offered to sell shillings, causing the exchange rate to harden. After reaching a high point, the price fell back. However, market sentiment remained firm, and buyers aggressively maintained the price during the dip. Shorts also covered their positions. Although banks offered to sell, the price gradually rose.</p>
<p>News that the Zhufeng Bank would be posting rates with British rates at par and American rates contracting by 0.0625 made the market tighten. Before long, the price broke through the 80 yuan mark. Foreign banks took advantage of the high price to sell, engaging in hedging activities, causing a temporary pullback. However, demand exceeded supply. The announcement of a higher silver equalization tax, increasing by half a point, fueled buying interest, and the price rose again. However, because banks and Qiao Zhifu continued to sell, the price fluctuated after reaching a high point. Market sentiment gradually became uncertain, and the price gradually retreated within the 80 yuan range, falling back at one point. However, inventory was depleted. Major players maintained the price during the dip, immediately breaking through the 80 yuan mark. Seeing the unfavorable situation, shorts rushed to cover their positions. With a lack of supply, Tong Fengheng aggressively covered shillings, making the market extremely firm at noon. The price rose further after the close. The after-market price approached the 90 yuan mark. After the opening, short covering intensified, breaking through the 9 yuan mark.</p>
<p>A Reuters report that the British Minister in Beijing was discussing international loan matters caused Chinese traders to sell, repeatedly causing the price to retreat within the 90 yuan range. After entering the market, a misreport that Indian silver had risen by five annas caused a temporary drop. The price of Indian silver improved immediately. Major players such as Tong Fengheng aggressively covered their short positions. Although banks sold, they struggled to cope. Buying interest surged, moving forward and approaching the 900 yuan mark. Banks continued to sell at the high price. Major players supplied at the high price before slightly weakening the market. However, with a short squeeze forming, buying interest was difficult to suppress. The market ultimately presented an extremely firm situation, but did not break through the 900 yuan mark. However, the price did break through after the close. The trend is extremely sharp, and the future still looks bullish. This is because although major players aggressively covered their positions today, it was only a portion. Here is a record of the day's market conditions:</p>
<p>The opening price in the morning was 874.7 yuan, higher than last Saturday. Hui Xiangfu, Yu Heng, Yu Fuxing, and Yongji immediately advanced from 4.5 yuan to 7.5 yuan. Hengyu, Dada, Fuyu, Tongtaichang, and Yonglilai sold. Qiao Zhifu sold 6.25 June shillings, falling to 3.2 yuan.

Dachengyingxiang sold at 5.2 yuan. News that HSBC's posted rates were British at par and American contracting by 0.0625 yuan remained steady. Hengyu, Yuanmao Yong, Huixiang Shenkang, Richang Dayuan advanced to 80.08 yuan. Mai Jia Li released 0.5 penny June shillings. Fuxingyong and Yongli sold high at 78 yuan. Wanxing and others advanced to 9.8 yuan, but because Mitsui released 1.875 May US dollars, Fuxingyong Yongli and Fuyu sold, causing the price to fall to 6.7 yuan. Hengyu Yuanmao, Yong Fuxingyongchang, Dada Yongli Dachengyingxiang and other bought strips one after another. Meifeng sold 0.0625 June US dollars, rising to 82.4 yuan. There was considerable fluctuation in the middle. Hengyu Yuanyi, Tong Taichang Dingkang took advantage of the high price and did not buy in later. Qiao Zhifu continued to sell shillings, gradually falling to 78.7 yuan. Unexpectedly, the announcement of a higher silver equalization tax, increasing by half a point, fueled buying interest again. Huixiang Wanxing Hengyu Dada and other advanced to 82.5 yuan. HSBC sold 4.375 June shillings. Fuyu Dada sold out, retreating to 0.08 yuan. Yuanchang Yongchang Dada continued to advance to 3.5 yuan.

Dalu Jiaotong still released 6.25 June US dollars. Rumors that Indian silver had risen by five annas caused Yuan Hengfu and Yong Dafa Bingyuxinxiang to take advantage of the situation and sell strips, retreating again to 88.5 yuan. Chinese merchants continued to cover shillings, causing the domestic market to tighten again. The initial news of the Indian silver market had no effect. Dada Chen Fuxingyong Yifeng Yong Hengyu Shengda Tong Fengheng all advanced, immediately rising to 97.2 yuan. Dafa Bing Wan Qian Changxiang took advantage of the high price to sell out, retreating to 5.7 yuan. However, because Tong Fengheng and others wanted to release 1.875 June shillings, it was difficult to say. HSBC's posted rates were changed to contract by 1.15 and 0.5 yuan. Tong Fengheng Dada Chen Yuanheng Hengyu Dafa Yong Huixiang competed to buy in, rising to 9 yuan. Yongli Dafa Yongchunyuan Yong Dada Chen closed their positions one after another, retreating to 4.6 yuan. Fuxingyong Huixiang Hengyu Yuanyi continued to advance to 6.8 yuan. The Indian silver market still had not changed. Although Qian Changxiang and others sold to 5 yuan, because Wuxing Fuyong worked hard to buy in, Yuanmaoyong Tongchunheng Hengyu Fuyu Changda all advanced, rising further to 9.5 yuan. Fuxingyong Huixiang Hengyu sold out, retreating to 6.3 yuan. Market sentiment remained steady. Changda Yuanmaoyong Hengyu bought strips, and the closing price rose again to 899.5 yuan. After the close, Yongli Yuanheng Dada Chen scattered shorts all advanced, once rushing to 0.012 yuan. Yongli Hengyu Fuxingyong and others sold out and fell. Finally, it retreated within the 900 yuan mark. The highest price of the day was 899.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 873.2 yuan, with a fluctuation of 26.3 yuan. As a result, it was much higher than last Saturday, surging 20.3 yuan.</p>

The price of pure gold was about 4 yuan, or 8787 yuan. The spot market was quiet. Tianjin goods were about 7.5 yuan higher. There were no transactions in the former Qing market. Swaps were also quiet. In April, Shu Zi was transferred from Yifeng Yong to Hengyu in 140 strips, priced at 877 yuan. Therefore, only 399 strips remained for this month's strips excluding public orders.</p>
<p>In-market trading was quite strong. In total, Tong Fengheng Da Changxiang Huiyuan Bingxing Fangsheng Yong Yuanchang Yong Richang Yifengyong Hengchang Yong Hongkang Yong Wanfeng Yuanheng Ren Fa Yong Futai Yong Jinlong Fuyu Chunyuan Yong Shunmao Changda and others were on the buy side.

<p>**Government Bonds Only See Swap Transactions, Market Prices Show Mixed Results**</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange remained extremely chaotic, generally fluctuating. With the Spring Festival holiday approaching, new trading was even scarcer. The market was not without activity, with mainly rollover transactions and some arbitrage, providing some embellishment to the market. Based on market observations, there is unlikely to be any new development in the next day or two. Yesterday morning, the market opened with a relatively firm tone. Prices of various securities generally rose. However, the sudden emergence of short positions caused the upward trend to falter, and some floating long positions emerged. As a result, bonds after the 22nd tariff saw prices retreat by 10 to 20 cents. However, 96 bonds remained firm, with the forward contract rising by 5 cents. The afternoon session went against the morning session. The aforementioned bonds rose by a small amount. Short positions rose by ten cents. With the afternoon market opening, market sentiment weakened further, and trading was even scarcer. The prices of twelve securities did not change at all. At the closing, some short positions rolled over more actively, and the prices of most securities rose by 10 to 20 cents. Overall, the market prices showed mixed results, and the total value of transactions was 11,128,600 yuan. The results of price increases and decreases are listed below (Unit: Yuan, Transaction Unit: 100 Yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e227">Cotton Yarn: Rumors Inflate Cotton Yarn Prices; Cotton Yarn Exchange to Close for Two Days Starting the 6th for the Holiday <a href="#e227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market experienced fatigue in the morning but surged in the afternoon, with the situation becoming tight. There were two main reasons for this: first, current yarn sales were becoming increasingly active, with demand coming one after another from South China, followed closely by the Sichuan group; second, rumors spread rampantly in the afternoon market, claiming that certain news was favorable to bullish positions, which instantly ignited enthusiasm among investors.</p>
<p>Gold Soars by Over One Yuan</p>
<p>In the forward cotton yarn market, the opening prices for all months were stagnant, as overseas cotton industries were sluggish and investor sentiment was weak. However, bullish traders remained calm and inactive, resulting in prices for all months falling by 1.2 jiao compared to the previous day's closing prices. The market atmosphere was drastically different in the afternoon session compared to the morning session, with the situation becoming unusually urgent. This was because the current yarn business continued to be robust, with sustained demand from the Guangdong, Yunnan, and Sichuan groups. Simultaneously, the bullish trend in the gold market resurfaced, further fueling buying interest in the cotton yarn market, causing market prices to tighten. Furthermore, rumors abounded in the market, all of which were said to benefit bullish positions. It was estimated that the total volume of current yarn transactions for the day exceeded 3,300 bales, and forward cotton yarn also closed firm. As a result, prices for all months rose by 2 yuan to 1.2, 3, and 5 jiao compared to the morning closing prices. Sales included 600 bales from Mei Ji, 1,100 bales from Jun Chang, 650 bales from Yu Da, 400 bales from Yuan Yi, 400 bales from Da Chang, 800 bales from Da Ji, 650 bales from Jin Chang, 750 bales from Ming De, 650 bales from Geng Feng, 900 bales from Shen Chang, and 450 bales from De Ji. Purchases included 800 bales from Shen Ji, 650 bales from Run Kang, 450 bales from He Xing, 600 bales from Ren Yan, 1,450 bales from Yuan Yi, 450 bales from Sheng Yuan, 400 bales from Rui Da, and 400 bales from Xin Hua. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Forward Cotton Yarn Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Account Balance</p>
<p>April Issue 183.5 181.3 183.5 Up 1.80 41,750</p>
<p>May Issue 182.3 180.6 182.3 1.40 46,950</p>
<p>June Issue 182.2 180.6 182.2 1.10 40,850</p>
<p>July Issue 182.4 180.8 182.4 1.10 47,150</p>
<p>August Issue 182.9 181.5 182.9 1.10 42,900</p>
<p>September Issue 183.5 181.9 183.5 —— ——</p>
<p>Total 219,600</p>
<p>Current Sales Exceed 3,000 Bales</p>
<p>Current yarn sales were quite robust. It was estimated that various groups purchased a total of 3,375 bales for the day, with prices rising by 0.5 to 1 yuan. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong 1,890 Changsha 25 Inland 60 Wuhu 5</p>
<p>Sichuan 470 Shantou 25 Fellow Traders 30 Northern Group 15</p>
<p>Nanjing 5 Yunnan 360 Tianjin 390</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Exchange Announces Holiday Closure</p>
<p>The Shanghai Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange announced that April 6th is Qingming Festival, and in accordance with custom, there will be a two-day holiday. The market will be closed on April 6th and 8th.</p>
<p>The cotton market initially declined and then rose, but overseas cotton markets were sluggish and uninspired. The local warehouses in this city have seen an increase in storage of both domestic and American cotton, with the amount of British-Indian cotton exceeding 100,000 bales. The market situation was still weak. Unexpectedly, gold prices soared and the balancing tax was raised by half a fen. The situation suddenly became tight in the afternoon. Rumors of certain events were particularly rife, so the market price rose more and more.</p>
<p>The Forward Cotton Market Steps Up</p>
<p>In the forward cotton market, opening prices for all months uniformly fell by 1.5 to 2 jiao, as Indian and American cotton saw mixed fluctuations of 2 to 3 pounds. The amount of cotton in Shanghai also increased, and the matter of import taxes on foreign cotton was still far from factual, leading to investor apathy. As a result, prices for all months fell by 0.1 to 0.2 jiao compared to the previous day's closing prices. When the afternoon session opened, buying interest in all months surged, and the situation became promising, attracting a large number of buyers. The reason for this was said to be the surge in gold prices, reaching a peak of 99 yuan, leading to the resurgence of certain rumors, which caused the market price to rise more and more. As a result, prices for all months rose by 0.25 to 0.45 jiao compared to the morning closing prices, but third-grade cotton fell by 0.7 to 0.8 jiao. Sales included 2,500 dan from Da Fu, 1,000 dan from Yu Da, 6,900 dan from Run Kang, 2,600 dan from Sui Long, 4,800 dan from Yuan Da, 2,200 dan from He Xing, 2,200 dan from Jun Chang, 1,800 dan from Tai Chang, and 1,300 dan from Heng Chang. Purchases included 5,700 dan from Rui Da, 2,100 dan from Jin Chang, 3,000 dan from Tong Feng, 4,400 dan from Chang He, 2,500 dan from Geng Feng, 1,600 dan from Shen Ji, 4,700 dan from Chang Feng, 1,000 dan from Sheng Yuan, 1,400 dan from Xin Heng, and 2,900 dan from Yuan Xing Chang. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Forward Cotton Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Day's Account Balance</p>
<p>April Issue 34.55 34.15 34.55 Up 0.15 24,200</p>

<p>August Issue 25.20 24.80 35.20 0.25 125,200</p>
<p>Total 817,600</p>
<p>Factory Demand Doesn't Exceed Odds and Ends</p>
<p>Current cotton sales are calm, and factory demand is only for sporadic amounts, but prices are slightly firm. Yao cotton arrived at 150 bales.</p>
<p>Shanghai Cotton Market, Sha Shi Cotton Price 41.50, Shanghai Factory Imports 150 Pieces, Spot Delivery to Factory</p>

<h3 id="e228">Results of September Cotton Yarn Grade Appraisal: 10-Count Coarse Yarn Downgraded by 4 Yuan; Special Margin Increased by 3 Yuan for New April Cotton Transactions <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange convened a cotton yarn grade appraisal meeting on March 25th to review the grades of cotton yarn for the September 1935 delivery period as a substitute for delivery. The result of the grade review was that the grade of 16-count cotton yarn was unchanged and the rise and fall was the same as in August. The grade of 20-count cotton yarn was only changed by reducing the grade of the English Yangshupu Factory's Shepherd Yarn by 5 yuan in August and now changed to 6 yuan. The remaining 20-count yarns were unchanged, but all 10-count yarns were downgraded by 4 yuan compared to the August grade. The reason for this was that the price of Indian cotton velvet flowers used to make the 10-count yarns was low, and the factories could make a profit from spinning, so the exchange was afraid that the low price would affect the market price of speculative selling. The grades of 10-count coarse yarns were therefore greatly reduced in order to regulate them. The revised procedures and grade prices are listed below for reference:</p>
<p>Original Price New Price</p>
<p>20-count Shepherd Yarn Reduced by 5 Yuan Reduced by 6 Yuan</p>
<p>10-count Four Seasons Da Fa Reduced by 32 Yuan Reduced by 36 Yuan</p>

<p>Blue Tiger Reduced by 48 Yuan Reduced by 52 Yuan</p>
<p>Three Lights Reduced by 48 Yuan Reduced by 52 Yuan</p>
<p>Also, September forward cotton will suspend the auction for one month starting in April due to the shortage of cotton during the time when old and new cotton crops meet, so there was no grade review.</p>
<p>The Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange announced that starting on April 1st, new transactions for April forward cotton will require an increased special margin of 3 yuan per dan, collected from both parties.</p>
<h3 id="e229">Grains: Near-Term Wheat is Uniquely Strong by 7 Fen; Forward Flour is Still Considered Stable <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's flour market was stable in the morning. Foreign wheat was quoted at approximately 0.20 yuan higher in Chicago, and Canadian wheat was approximately 0.04 yuan higher. When the market opened, near-term wheat was slightly higher, and due to the good results of March, investors inside and outside the industry naturally felt stable. Sellers did not dare to substantially reduce their offers, while buyers still showed greed. As a result, the opening prices for all months were approximately 0.01 or 0.02 yuan higher. However, as settlement had just passed, actual sales were cautious and stagnant. Although the situation was stable, trading was not very active. When the afternoon session opened, it was initially stable, with the current month continuing to be 0.075 yuan higher. Later in the session, prices showed weakness because manufacturers were slightly short-selling far-term contracts, and near-term customers were also inactive. However, the current stocks of flour at various mills were not yet plentiful, so there was little hope for an oversupply in the short term. As a result, the current month closed 0.01125 yuan higher, May closed 0.005 yuan higher, June closed 0.01125 yuan higher, July closed 0.00075 yuan lower, August closed 0.005 yuan higher, and the opening price for September was 0.36 yuan, with no changes at the close.</p>
<p>Yesterday's wheat market showed a trend of near-term firmness and far-term stability. Foreign wheat quotations were favorable, and the current month's opening price was increased by 0.07 yuan compared to the end of the previous month because the supply of old stock was scarce and market inventories were not plentiful, which caused investors in the industry to gradually think about raising prices. However, trading was very light afterwards, and there were no new entries or exits. For far-term months, investor sentiment was slightly weaker due to the fine weather, but later, buyers surged in, bringing a slightly firm trend. Looking ahead, the key to future price movements will be whether the new wheat crops are in good condition. As a result, the current month closed 0.07 yuan higher, August closed 0.01 yuan higher, and the remaining months were unchanged. In the current wheat market, due to the scarcity of arrivals, customers were bargaining prices up, and various offers were increased by 0.02 or 0.03 yuan. Anhui wheat was quoted at 3.74 yuan, Haizhou wheat at 3.70 yuan, and Jiangbei wheat at 3.64 yuan. 500 bags were purchased by Fuxin and 500 bags were purchased by Xinda.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, arrivals from various groups suddenly became scarce, with over 20 ships arriving from the north (totaling 4,000 shi), and retail sales were active. For example, the Qingdao group purchased over 1,000 bags, and the situation continued to be tight. Market prices rose, with high-quality and thin indica rice increasing by 0.15 to 0.20 yuan, and Yin Yuan rice also saw an increase of over 0.10 yuan due to slightly broader sales channels.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the Yujidun Riverway was still passable, resulting in approximately 30 ships arriving from various locations. Because the riverway was about to be cut off and the price in the production area was high, customers were firm in their thinking, and the sales of various commodities in the market were active, causing market prices to increase unevenly. High-quality white rice increased by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, and medium- to low-quality rice increased by as much as 0.40 to 0.50 yuan. Early thin indica rice also increased by 0.20 to 0.30 yuan, and Yangjian rice followed suit, increasing by 0.10 to 0.20 yuan. White Yuan rice sales were brisk, and retail sales gradually faded, with prices increasing by nearly 0.10 yuan. The remaining goods showed a slightly tight trend.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Yesterday, foreign rice sales were active due to continuous purchases from local customers, which stirred investor sentiment, and buyers were particularly persistent. In addition to continued brisk purchases from local groups, there was also competition from Hankou, Jiujiang, and Anqing groups, with small Jiaomi rice being highly sought after, causing the price to continue to rise by 0.10 yuan. Furthermore, the amount of rice arriving in the market was not as much as Saigon or Siamese rice, so the market had an upward trend. Yesterday's opening price was 9.60 yuan, which was an increase of 0.50 yuan compared to the lowest price last week. Saigon rice trading was even more robust yesterday, and prices also increased by 0.05 to 0.06 yuan. A total of 13,000 bags of Saigon rice, 3,000 bags of small Jiaomi rice, and 3,000 bags of Siamese rice and other rice were opened for sale in the city.

<p>— Another Realm</p>
<p>Mo Di coined a nickname for the scholar-official class of the time, calling them "Other Scholars". "Other Scholars" was in contrast to his self-proclaimed "Inclusive Scholars." He explained the difference between inclusiveness and otherness, saying:</p>
<p>"Those who follow the will of Heaven are inclusive; those who oppose the will of Heaven are other. Inclusiveness takes righteousness as its way; otherness takes force as its way."</p>
<p>But what is following Heaven, and what is opposing Heaven? He did not explain this. It seems that ancient people always liked to talk about "the will of Heaven," as if the will of Heaven was like this, and there was nothing more to say! But this easily leads to fatalism. Mo Di was not a fatalist; his saying that following Heaven naturally meant taking righteousness as the way, while taking force as the way was opposing Heaven. From this, we can see that Mo Di did not blindly support the established facts. If these established facts came from force, he would still "differ" from them.</p>
<p>But here is a problem: if we analyze the facts before us, we can clearly see whether they are righteous or not; but if they are not what we have witnessed with our own eyes, but matters in the hands of the previous generation or the generation before that, or even matters from hundreds or thousands of years ago, how can we discern whether they are righteous or not? The fact tells us that the so-called history of today is often not a history of righteousness, and the history of righteousness is often erased by later historians. Why? Because the history of righteousness is often mostly unfavorable to the established facts. After the historians twist it with their pens, it seems that those who use force are "following the will of Heaven," while those who are righteous become "opposing the will of Heaven." Later generations do not investigate and often confuse black and white, and we cannot distinguish who is an inclusive scholar and who is an other scholar.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we read history now, we cannot rely solely on these materials that praise force, and we cannot ignore those unofficial histories, notes, and novels. "Digging up" other sources is also a valuable resource.</p>
<h3 id="e232">Curiosities Picked Up <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Wopu</p>
<p>(1) Feng Yulan</p>
<p>In Zang Jinsu's Yuan Qu Selection of One Hundred Plays, except for Six Types: Children's Reunion, Jin Anshou's Outskirts of the City, Willow Mistakenly Enters the Peach Garden, Opposite Jade Comb, Xiao Shulan. These are actually works of the early Ming Dynasty, which have long been verified. According to Dong Ji's General Catalogue Summary of Musical Dramas, Volume 4, the entry on Feng Yulan states:</p>
<p>"According to the play, there is Qingjiangpu, which was opened by Chen Xuan, the Earl of Pingjiang, in the tenth year of Yongle in the Ming Dynasty. It also says that Vice Censor-in-Chief Jin Gui is the Pacification Commissioner of Tingnan. "Vice Censor-in-Chief" and "Pacification Commissioner" are both official titles of the Ming Dynasty. This was likely written by someone after the Yong and Xuan periods, and falsely attributed to a Yuan Dynasty person."</p>
<p>These two pieces of evidence are very strong. Although it is said that the spoken parts in the Yuan Qu Selection are mostly not from the Yuan Dynasty and are suspected of being added later, we have no reason to prove that they have ever been tampered with. Therefore, this last type of variety play in the Qu Selection, Feng Yulan's Crying Jiang Zhou by Moonlight, must be considered a work of the Ming Dynasty, reducing the total number of Yuan Dynasty musical dramas that have been passed down. In addition to Feng Yulan, there are also twenty-two anonymous works in the Yuan Qu Selection. Perhaps there are also works of the Ming Dynasty similar to this that have not been identified, which is not known at this time?</p>
<p>(2) The Story of the Tavern</p>
<p>The story of Wang Zhihuan writing on the wall of a tavern does not seem to have attracted the attention of playwrights in the Yuan and early Ming dynasties. It was not until the late Ming and early Qing dynasties that it became a popular theme for playwrights. According to what is currently known to be recorded, there are variety plays: Zhang Longwen's Tavern Swallow, Qiu Lian's Tavern (Early Collection of Qing Dynasty Variety Plays) and musical dramas: Zheng Zhiwen, Lu Jianzeng and Jin Jiao (?) all three named The Story of the Tavern. Zheng Zhiwen's version is very rare. Zheng Xidi has a collection (see Gou Ji's New Losses and New Discoveries of Chinese Opera History Materials). The Lu and Jin versions have quite a few problems that are worth studying. The Story of the Tavern, which is not difficult to obtain now, is about a singing girl named Xie Bianfa, and it is uncertain whether it belongs to Lu? or Jin? There is no fixed conclusion. Jin Jiao's version may not even have existed. This version of The Story of the Tavern has a preface by the Shandong Cangfu of Qianlong Yimao (1759). The preface states:</p>
<p>"Yangzhou is the most prosperous place in the world, and the bamboo flute" singing of "Zhuxi" has been盛 from the Tang Dynasty to the present. It is fitting that there are many actors in various departments. However, people are tired of the old, and if a new script is heard, they will rush to buy and perform it, in order to change the current situation of those who are writing, most of whom are motivated by profit. Those who guide depravity are dissolute and forget to return, and those who describe the strange are absurd and outrageous. Stupid men, foolish women, and young children praise them, which will lead to harm to people's hearts and customs. I am very disapproving of this, but I have nothing to replace it. Lan Jing born in Quanjiao, is keen on elegance and literary pursuits. He asked me for poems after traveling to Daoyou. When the poems were completed, he mentioned the story of writing on the wall in the tavern recorded in the Tang Dynasty Strange Records. He said that since ancient times, many loyal and brave deeds have been omitted from official history but included in story collections. They can all be set to music in musical dramas. "Shuangyi" is adorable and can add luster to our party. If it is set to music, it should not lose its elegance. It is a pity that the poets since the Yuan and Ming dynasties have not done so. Lan Jing said yes, then traveled to Yangzhou after a year and presented me with the complete Story of the Tavern. I loved its clear and elegant lyrics but was troubled by its complex plot. When I arranged it according to the musical scale, there were also some parts that were not completely in harmony. So I discussed it with Xiyuan, and we consulted with veteran theater instructors to arrange the stage, slightly changing its mechanism so that it was suitable for both popular and elegant tastes. I occasionally indulged in drunken writing, expressing my thoughts freely. Although I was not familiar with musical notation, my intention followed my pen, and it naturally matched the beat. There were also things that I could not explain. After the Story was completed, Shen Changzhou happened to arrive and played the final song. Mr. Shen praised it and said: It is a good medicine for the two families who guide depravity and describe the strange. He wrote six quatrains on the book and advised it to be printed."</p>
<p>Shen Guiyu's six inscription poems are also still there. There is also a postscript by Ningdu Lu Duanchen. This preface is a very important record, which can be used to explain the difference between the Lu and Jin versions. We know that Lu Jianzeng was the salt transport commissioner of Lianghuai, stationed in Yangzhou, and a native of Dezhou. Therefore, this Shandong Cangfu is undoubtedly his pseudonym. The original author of the extant musical drama, Quanjiao Lan Jing, was probably his client. Because he consulted and revised it (judging from the tone in the preface, it could even be said that he rewrote or even collaborated on it), and he entrusted it to printing, and there was no official name of the author on the book, later it was considered to be his work, and it was listed together with Yu Chichi Tower. It is feared that Yu Chichi Tower was also not Lu's own work, but was penned by Zhu Gongfang (Ben), as seen in the Qiu Deng Conghua, cited in Jiang Ruizao's Novel Research. Lu was in charge of elegance in the southeast at the time and reviewed (or, to put it bluntly, seized) several songs, and it was common for literati to become patrons of opera writers. Shen's inscription poem even says, "Official pavilion filling lyrics, the rhyme is the clearest." For generations, this musical drama has been regarded as Lu's work, which is not necessarily wrong. But the jokes that have been passed down are obviously based on the misunderstanding that Quanjiao Lan Jing is the same as Ling Jiao, whose courtesy name is Lanjiao. One word error has led to the addition of a Jin version of The Story of the Tavern. Since Li Diaoyuan's Yucun Opera Talk, Wang Guowei's Opera Records, and Wu Mei's General Theory of Chinese Opera, the writings on opera have mostly inherited this error, and no one has corrected it. Could it be that Wang and Wu have not seen this version of The Story of the Tavern?</p>
<p>On the Shanghai China Bookstore's fourteenth volume of new and old books, there is A Thin Story of the Tavern in two volumes, written and printed during the Qianlong period, signed by Quanjiao Wu _, which is probably the same version as the one mentioned above and not another version. But the several copies of A Thin Story of the Tavern that I have seen all do not involve the words "Wu _". I wonder what the bookstore is basing its claim on? Or perhaps it is simply registered here because the local tribute scholars from Quanjiao are similar, and the courtesy name of Lanjiao is similar. However, Zun Sheng was born in 1755 (Qianlong Bingzi), and when Shandong Cangfu and Lan Jing's Story of the Tavern were written, he was only five years old. Shen Guiyu, who wrote the inscription poem, died in 1779 (Qianlong Jichou), and Wu was only fifteen years old. It seems impossible for him to have written the book! Unless there is really another Story of the Tavern, and this book is not the same version, then there is no contradiction in time. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e234">Little Foot Beans <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Qinwen</p>
<p>Little foot beans are also called gizzard beans because they are oval in shape, with many wrinkles along the bean tip, like a chicken gizzard. They are made from a type of edamame; salt is added during cooking, so the light greenish-blue skin is covered with white salt. Chewing them is chewy and firm, with a salty and savory taste and a fragrant aroma. They are called little foot beans because they are wrapped in Fuyang straw paper, in pointed packages, as if they are a pair of old-fashioned women's little feet.</p>
<p>In my hometown, little foot beans are like the aniseed beans written about by Mr. Lu Xun in Kong Yiji, a type of snack to eat with wine. But they are more eye-catching than aniseed beans. The pointed little packages are stacked high in the plate, which is not only exciting for people drinking wine, but can also elicit saliva from children.</p>
<p>When I was young, I often bought little foot beans to eat. At that time, they only cost one cent per package, and one copper coin could buy ten packages. Usually, one copper coin had to be divided into three or four purchases, buying three or four packages first and getting six or seven coins in change, then buying three or four packages again several times. But there were also times when I spent the whole copper coin and filled my pockets.</p>
<p>When I came home from school around noon or evening, my stomach was already empty. It tasted best to buy little foot beans to eat on the way. But before going to school, I would first buy them on the way and hide them in my pocket. When I was hungry in class, I would secretly open the straw paper package and put them into my mouth one by one, which was also a special taste.</p>
<p>From my house to school, I had to go through a long alley called Bridge Alley. There was a tavern in the middle of Bridge Alley that also sold little foot beans. The people running the tavern were a father and son: an old man and a middle-aged man. Everyone called it "Ah Lan's tavern," but no one knew whether it referred to the old man or the middle-aged man, or whether the character Lan in Ah Lan was written this way. But since I left my hometown, I have often recalled the living conditions of my childhood by chance, and associated them with the little foot beans of Ah Lan's tavern. Sometimes, I have also associated the various aspects of childhood life from the little foot beans. Especially in the past few years in Hangzhou, because I occasionally encountered the children from Ah Lan's tavern—who had grown into youths, with thin, white faces and pointed chins; if Ah Lan originally referred to the old man at that time, then this must be Ah Lan's grandson—I would often think of the little foot beans.</p>
<p>Lately, the more difficult my life has become, the more I have easily thought of the little foot beans—in my life history, the years of eating little foot beans can truly be considered a "golden age." Last time I returned to my hometown, I had already anticipated that I would very much like to eat little foot beans again and review the interests of childhood life. Although Ah Lan's tavern was still open there, and there were still pointed packages of little foot beans stacked high in the plate, various signs of decline at home dispelled my thoughts in the air. In fact, even if I insisted on buying little foot beans, I would not get the fun of those years, because I could no longer go to the classroom in school and touch them one by one. Although this taste is "gone for me," the nephews and nieces who are in their childhood should enjoy it properly. But according to my third brother, because the harvest is poor and taxes are heavy, the schools in my hometown are still suspended. Children don't even have a place to study, so there's no way to talk about the taste of eating little foot beans.</p>

<p>— Ding</p>
<p>Such things are not uncommon. In books, in friends' casual chatter, in many situations, I often see and hear them. However, when it comes to experiencing it myself, it's different.</p>
<p>The matter is like this: One evening, as I was passing the entrance of the Great World, I was suddenly stopped by a woman who shouted in a worn-out voice, "Brother Ying, Brother Ying! Oh... where are you going? I haven't seen you in so long."</p>
<p>I looked up and saw a pale face, filled with a kind of life's bitterness and misfortune! Her eyes silently held unbearable sorrowful tears, staring blankly at me. I also stared blankly at her for a while. In my memory, I seemed to have seen such a woman before. However, even after strong searching, I still couldn't remember who she was.</p>
<p>"Forgotten? Brother Ying! Yes... yes, you wouldn't keep someone like me in your heart, oh... Brother Ying. You should remember me, ah, don't you really remember me at all?" She clung tightly to my side, trembling. I saw her chest rising and falling rapidly.</p>
<p>"Ah... really, I'm sorry, I forgot. Who are you? Tell me."</p>
<p>"Zhu Guifang... your classmate, a good friend five years ago," she said directly.</p>
<p>"Ah... you... are you Zhu Guifang? You... really are... Zhu Guifang? No... don't lie to me!" I was suddenly bewildered by this unexpected event.</p>
<p>At this time, the bystanders standing around us looked at us with curious eyes, and some even laughed out loud.</p>
<p>My face felt as if it had been烤 over fire, and my heart was in disarray.</p>
<p>She then dragged me along, saying:</p>
<p>"Brother Ying, let's go to my place and talk. There are too many people here, it's not convenient, and you're embarrassed!" She wasn't as desolate as before. When she spoke to me in that gentle tone, in her smiling coquettishness, I indeed remembered her previous attitude.</p>
<p>"Ah! Guifang..." I sighed, my heart feeling as if it had been pierced by a white blade.</p>
<p>"Don't worry, Brother Ying! As long as you... can... can remember me... someone like me... I'll... I'll be grateful to you."</p>
<p>"Life is truly ever-changing!" I said with emotion.</p>
<p>She looked at me, and a kind of unfortunate sorrow repeatedly shrouded her face. I didn't say anything more, lest I make her sad. So we walked in silence. She held my hand tightly, clinging tightly to my side.</p>
<p>"We're here, Brother Ying. This is my home..." Standing in the alley, she said.</p>
<p>"This is your home?" I questioned. I looked at the light hanging at the entrance, a white porcelain shade with red oil characters: "Guifen."</p>
<p>After a deep sigh, I followed her into her room.</p>
<p>"Please sit, Brother Ying. Let me tell you. You must be very surprised, right? Naturally, you wouldn't have imagined that Guifang would end up in this situation!"</p>
<p>"What's going on? Alas!..."</p>
<p>"Nothing else, Brother Ying, this isn't what I wanted either. Who would want this? But... it's really a last resort! A person, especially a woman without support, a woman without a father, a woman without opportunities for advancement, a woman without money to support her elderly mother in her sixties or seventies, like me! Besides trying to find some money, what other options are there? I need to live, my mother needs to live, my younger siblings need to live, my burden is heavy, my responsibility is great, I have to find a way to live. I've done everything, office worker, maid, factory worker. Brother Ying, you know my family situation, you also understand my personal character and behavior, didn't you once say to me?... 'Guifang... you are a capable person, intelligent, hardworking, and of good character, your future is limitless, you are an outstanding and promising woman...' However, Brother Ying! Those words only made me resentful and sad. People are completely controlled by their environment, like me, a fragile woman. In these four or five years, I've suffered enough of all kinds of torments and hardships... I've given up on this life. But, Brother Ying, you must understand me, understand me, and for me, speak to the world, to society, and to all our acquaintances, explain my situation, my misfortune, especially this kind of sin that I've committed!"</p>
<p>Then she began to sob.</p>
<h3 id="e236">Mr. Juqing (4) <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>In order to cope with these difficulties, Mr. Juqing had to carefully change the textbooks in the private school. Those thread-bound and stone-printed commercial application letter models, and even Western-style vernacular textbooks that were awkward to recite, entered the door and accompanied "Elementary Learning," "Mencius," and so on. Doing such things made Mr. Juqing as sad as a widow who had lost her chastity when trying to build a memorial arch. Vernacular Chinese was something he had always despised. Moreover, his only source of pride in his superior position among the many tutors in the town was that he could teach "Confucius said" and "The Book of Songs."</p>
<p>However, everything was irreversible. Just like the date of opening the school this first month of the year, he had no choice but to follow the trend and start early. Because of opening the school, he was nervously busy for several days beforehand. Madam Juqing, who was not often seen on the street, also squinted her old, near-sighted eyes and hobbled around the street on her small feet, informing the students of the start of school. Mr. Juqing himself was even more like a soldier charging to the front line, anxiously preoccupied, thinking about the opening of the school even while eating and sleeping. He wanted to use his own efforts to reverse a little of the current misfortune.</p>
<p>That day, Mr. Juqing met Mr. Tang, the father of student Tang Jialu, a self-cultivating farmer in the town in not-so-bad circumstances. Measuring the seven- or eight-year-old child next to Mr. Tang, Mr. Juqing squeezed out a little smile on his triangular face and began to chat with him:</p>
<p>"This is your son, how old is he?" Touching the child's shaved head.</p>
<p>"Seven years old after the new year, sir," he replied respectfully.</p>
<p>"Oh, very obedient!"</p>
<p>He nodded repeatedly, seeming to sincerely praise him. In his heart, he was considering how to put forward his main point tactfully. After hesitating for a while, he finally said, "You can send him to school, Mr. Tang." After saying that, his sunken eyes stared fixedly, waiting for a reply.</p>
<p>Mr. Tang smiled, a bitter smile.</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, he should be going to school according to his age. But 'water inlet' (note) is tight, and it's hard to make a living. Our farmers' annual harvest, after paying taxes and grain, isn't even enough to eat. We have to put aside the matter of the children's schooling. The district office added an education donation last year, saying it was for the school's expenses. It's still a farmer's child going to school, isn't it going to 'charge money' (note)!"</p>
<p>Listening to Mr. Tang's complaints, Mr. Juqing's heart turned cold. Looking at his purplish-red face, a large pile of wrinkles squeezed up, and the awkward expression that was like a smile but not a smile, it seemed that there were still many hardships he hadn't finished complaining about. He continued:</p>
<p>"Sir! I was originally planning to go to your residence these two days. Yesterday, the teacher's wife came to my house to notify me about the opening of the school, but I wasn't home, so I didn't tell her... (stopped for a moment) In recent years, our Jialu has been well taught by Mr. Yan, and he should study hard for a few more years to find a good business. But there are few people in the family, and it's expensive to hire a long-term worker, and they eat a lot, so... so, this year our Jialu has no choice but to drop his books and stay at home to help with the work."</p>
<p>Every word vibrated in Mr. Juqing's eardrums, buzzing like thunder. He was stunned and didn't open his mouth, and he almost didn't fall down.</p>
<p>(Note) "Water inlet" means "times" and "book money" means "tuition."</p>

<h3 id="e237">Anglo-Russian Talks and China <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Li Min</p>
<p>The leader of a Western imperialist power, the British Empire, and a socialist country, the Soviet Union, have recently started negotiations between the two countries in Moscow by their respective representatives. This is a very important international event. Britain is the oldest empire in the West, while the Soviet Union is another country with a political system that is absolutely opposite to Britain. These two countries have always been in a position of irreconcilable conflict in international politics, but now they have actually begun to join hands for talks. What an interesting thing this is.</p>
<p>However, this is not surprising. Although Britain is an old empire in the West and has always opposed the Soviet Union, recently, due to the rise of Germany and its automatic rearmament, Britain is unable to control this chaotic European situation. On the other hand, Russia's power in Europe is increasing day by day, having reconciled with France and contacted various small countries. The United States, far away in the Americas, also restored diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union last year. Under this situation, the British Empire has no choice but to turn around and befriend this strange country in Europe in order to maintain its hegemony in Europe. This is a major reason why Britain is willing to send representatives to Moscow to talk with Russia. Russia needs all countries to reconcile with it and not attack it, so it is naturally more than welcoming Britain's willingness to come.</p>
<p>The world situation is truly ever-changing. In the few years after the European War - and even more so now - all countries hated this revolutionary Russia. However, in less than ten years, since two or three years ago, all countries have turned around and become close to Russia. This is enough for our country to reflect on. Naturally, the reason for this is that, on the one hand, the weak country of the past has now become a strong country, and on the other hand, the situation has created a force that can tip the scales. Therefore, countries with completely different ideologies also have a tendency to cooperate in the same boat. From this point of view, international affairs are nothing more than a pursuit of interests.</p>
<p>What is most noteworthy is the China issue. According to the news reports, these Anglo-Russian talks may touch upon the issue of China's territorial integrity. I don't know what their opinions on this issue are, and how they will discuss it? I am not in a position to predict it at this time, but in short, this is also in their interests and certainly not in our country's interests.</p>
<h3 id="e238">Zilu Asks the Way <a href="#e238" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c238" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">238</a></h3>
<p>— Erlang</p>
<p>Confucius left the state of Ye and was about to return to the state of Cai. On the way, he saw two people, Chang Ju and Jie Ni, plowing the field side by side. Confucius was very surprised and thought, "These two people are probably hermits." It happened that the disciple walking in front ran back and said, "There are two roads ahead, and I don't know which one is the right way to Cai. Please ask the teacher, should we go left or right?" Confucius didn't know either, and thought, "What should I do?" He instructed Zilu, "Zhong You, go and ask the people in the field." Zilu took the order and went, stood on the edge of the field, and respectfully asked Chang Ju and Jie Ni, "Excuse me, we want to go to the state of Cai, there are two roads ahead, and I don't know whether to go left or right?" Chang Ju and Jie Ni stopped plowing upon hearing this. Chang Ju glanced at Zilu and said, "Who is the one sitting in the carriage?" Zilu said, "It's Mr. Kong Qiu." He asked again, "Is it Kong Qiu of the state of Lu?" Zilu nodded and said, "Yes, that's right." Chang Ju laughed loudly and said, "Since it's him, then he knows the way." Jie Ni asked, "Who are you?" Zilu said, "My surname is Shen, and my name is You." He scrutinized him for a while and said, "Are you a disciple of Kong Qiu?" Zilu nodded, already very unhappy. Jie Ni said contemptuously, "There are so many people who are drunk and dreaming! But who is the savior?... Moreover, it is better to follow those who do not talk about politics than to follow those who study politics?" After saying that, he ignored Zilu, and the two of them continued to plow the field. Zilu stood there, thinking that these two people were really rude. He asked them the way sincerely, but after saying a few words, they also mocked him! It's okay if you don't tell me the way, why do you have to mock me, you bastards, I'll beat you up!" Confucius saw from afar that Chang Ju and Jie Ni ignored Zilu, and Zilu was standing on the edge of the field, clenching his fists and rubbing his palms, looking like he was about to use force, so he hurriedly called a disciple to pull Zilu back. Confucius frowned and asked, "Zhong You, what's wrong?" Zilu told Confucius everything about his conversation with Chang Ju and Jie Ni. Confucius sighed and said, "How can people be with animals? If the world is peaceful, I will not talk about politics."</p>
<p>One day, Zilu fell behind, feeling very anxious, and didn't know where Confucius's carriage had gone. He met an old man by the roadside, pulled him and asked, "Did you see the teacher?" The old man looked at Zilu and knew that he was a disciple of Kong Qiu. He sneered and said, "He doesn't work with his hands, and he doesn't know the five grains. How is he worthy of being a teacher?" Saying that, he stuck his cane in the edge of the field, got down into the field, and led the ox to plow the mud, ignoring him. Zilu had no choice but to find his own way. Unexpectedly, after walking not far and turning a bend, Confucius's carriage was parked under a large tree in front, resting. He hurried up and took long strides, and told Confucius what the old man had said, saying, "That old man is really hateful, he is scolding the teacher." Confucius lowered his eyebrows and thought for a while, "That's a hermit! What he said is right." Zilu thought that it would be very beneficial to go back and ask him some questions, and since he dared to say that their teacher was not worthy of being a teacher, then he must be more knowledgeable than their teacher. Without caring whether Confucius was happy or not, he turned around and ran back. But after turning a bend and running a long way, he was sweating all over. When he looked up, the old man was not plowing in the field, and he didn't know where he had gone.</p>

<p>Editor:</p>
<p>I am a high school graduate who gave up school to go into business due to economic difficulties, and since then, I have lost the opportunity to study. But because my knowledge base is too shallow, I cannot fully understand everything, especially natural sciences, which I find extremely vague. For example, I often see a lot of talk about "petroleum" in the newspaper, and I feel doubtful. I wonder, what is this petroleum? Is it gasoline? Is it kerosene? Is it another kind of oil?</p>
<p>I have asked many friends about this question, but they also don't know much about it, only telling me that it is a kind of oil extracted from minerals. They don't know if it is the same kind as gasoline.</p>
<p>I have a very annoying habit, which is that when I encounter a question, I must pursue it until I get to the bottom of it. Since others cannot satisfy my desire for knowledge, I have no choice but to bother you, sir. I think you will definitely be able to give me a clear explanation of it, right? But do you find me annoying? Sincerely,</p>
<p>Chang Zhilong respectfully</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Chang's habit of "breaking the clay pot to get to the bottom" is not a "bad" habit. It is a very helpful habit for learning. Nowadays, many people don't understand something, but they are unwilling to ask others because they are afraid of being laughed at. What a wrong mentality this is! Because no matter what, one can never understand everything in the world, and everyone naturally has things that they don't know. Therefore, asking others about questions that you don't know is not shameful, it is really a very good habit. I hope that everyone should have this kind of "questioning attitude". I think that the knowledge gained from others may be more valuable than the knowledge gained from reading books.</p>
<p>Petroleum is a general term for naphtha, commonly known as kerosene. It is a yellow or brown liquid, slightly transparent, with a certain</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>odor, highly volatile, and easily flammable. Before the invention of gas lamps, petroleum was often used for lighting. Now, in addition to lighting, petroleum has other very important uses. It can operate petroleum-powered engines and gas-powered engines, for use in ships, cars, airplanes, and various industries. Military weapons such as airplanes and submarines require huge amounts of naphtha, so its position in military affairs is very important. At this time when there is a crisis of the outbreak of World War II, the competition for petroleum has become an important policy of various countries. The so-called "petroleum war" refers to this. Japan occupies our Eastern Provinces because there are abundant minerals such as naphtha and iron there, which can supply her with raw materials for war.</p>
<p>Naphtha is mostly hidden in new and old sedimentary rocks, or gushes out from mud volcanoes (volcanoes that erupt mud), and is accompanied by gases of hydrocarbons bursting out of volcanoes. As for the origin of naphtha, some say it is formed from inorganic solutions inside the earth, others say it comes from terrestrial plants. Recently, some have said that naphtha is formed from the fatty substances of organic matter, decomposed over a long period of time at relatively low temperatures. This seems to be a more credible explanation.</p>
<p>The mineral content of naphtha is too flammable, and it is not suitable for use in lamps. Usually, its volatility is utilized, and it is separated by distillation. The method is to put the crude oil extracted from the ground (which still has many viscous and black substances mixed in) into a蒸馏器heater, and the easily volatile part initially becomes steam and comes out. This steam is cooled and condensed, becoming volatile oil, which is used as fuel for automobiles, airplanes, submarines, and other machines. This is commonly known as gasoline. The next substance to evaporate at a slightly higher temperature is called lamp oil, which is commonly called kerosene, and is used in petroleum lamps and petroleum engines. The next substance to evaporate at an even higher temperature is called machine oil, which is used to lubricate axles and make them rotate smoothly. The next substance obtained is mineral fat, which is neither solid nor liquid, but a viscous substance in the crude oil, used to coat the surface of metals to prevent rust. Next is paraffin, used to make candles. What is left at the end is oil residue, called asphalt, used for roads, sand, and so on.</p>
<p>Based on existing estimates, the countries with the largest deposits of paraffin oil are the United States and Russia, accounting for about nine-tenths of the world's total. There is no accurate estimate of the production of paraffin oil mines in China, but it is probably very abundant. Its production areas are mostly in Xinjiang, Sichuan, Shaanxi, and other places. There are already more than a dozen oil wells being exploited, but most of the mining rights are controlled by foreign merchants. The outflow of rights and interests is really a matter that we should pay attention to.</p>

<p>Qi, Lu, and Zheng Entering Xu (Continued)</p>
<p>Now offering it to Qi. But Qi dared not accept it. Offered it to Lu. Lu dared not accept it. Finally returning it to Zheng. Yet the Earl of Zheng still dared not sever the ancestral sacrifices of Xu. Marking off the borders of Xu. Alas. Who would say that the Spring and Autumn period was a time of contention and seizing, yet again seeing the style of virtue and yielding among the lords. Qi and Lu had no merit and dared not seize the merit of others. Zheng, although having merit, dared not hold onto their own merit. This is to be good at dealing with those without merit. Those like Qi and Lu. Good at dealing with those with merit. None surpass Zheng. This heart. How could it only be used in the midst of battlefields. Greatly sharing governance, and minutely sharing wealth. Extending this heart and residing in it, one will not fail to find contentment wherever they go. (End)</p>
<p>Marquis of Xi Attacks Zheng</p>
<p>Residing in lowliness, hating labor. Residing in poverty, hating hardship. Residing in difficulty, hating humiliation. All are the causes of disaster. The principle of the world. Lowliness does not seek labor, yet labor arrives on its own. Poverty does not seek hardship, yet hardship arrives on its own. Difficulty does not seek humiliation, yet humiliation arrives on its own. Not knowing that they cannot be separated and wanting to separate them. This is throwing oneself into disaster. The virtuous consider labor to be the constant of lowliness. Hardship is the constant of poverty. Humiliation is the constant of difficulty. That which makes them brave disaster is merely not being able to abide by their constant. If one abides in labor oneself, then one will be at peace in lowliness. If one abides in hardship oneself, then one will be at peace in poverty. If one abides in humiliation oneself, then one will be at peace in difficulty. The way of residing in a small country is also like this.</p>

<h3 id="e245">Helen Hayes' Childhood Reflected Through Her Beloved Daughter, Manley <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Renqin</p>
<p>Helen Hayes' name seems to need no introduction. What I want to introduce now is her beloved daughter, Manley. Manley is only five years old now and doesn't yet understand that she is fortunate to be the daughter of a big star, enjoying days of play. She's like a little Dutch girl, with two honey-yellow braids hanging over her shoulders. Her little mouth is red, and it is expected to stir the hearts of many young people in the future.</p>
<p>Helen Hayes is a big star who is both on stage and on screen, but because she herself has been acting since childhood and has not enjoyed the family happiness that children should enjoy, she now values family more than others. Her love for her Manley is self-evident. Helen Hayes' body does not belong to herself. It belongs to the vast audience, her husband, her mother, but the largest part belongs to her beloved daughter, Manley.</p>
<p>Once, a reporter went to visit Helen, but she unintentionally encountered Manley, which made her visit very rewarding. Manley ran in from outside, covered in mud. She entered the house! and sat on the floor in the middle of the room, starting to take off her shoes and socks. A dog ran over, sticking out its long tongue and licking her face, nose, and ears, expressing its welcome to the little master. At this moment, Manley began to murmur. She said, "I bought this for Christmas because my Michael is gone. He likes to lick my face, which makes me have to wash it several times, I mean wash my face several times, because you know, after a dog licks you, your face has a dog smell. You say it's okay not to wash it?" This long little speech made her breathless. So she had to laugh to herself, revealing her two dimples. Isn't this the reporter's unexpected gain?</p>
<p>At this moment, Helen had already walked in. Her youth and beauty were still evident, even though she was already a wife. "Whatever</p>
<p>Readers should note that Helen Hayes' performing life began at the age of five. She said, "My entry into the theater world is similar to Xiao Lidan's entry into the film industry now. My mother sent me to a dance school, telling me to get some good posture, as well as having an ingrown toe, and the doctor said that dancing could correct it. It was at the school's seasonal public performance, which was held by renting a theater, that I was seen by a big shot in the theater world. That was the beginning of my theatrical life. I was only five years old at the time, the same age as Manley is now.</p>
<p>"Manley is the same age as I was then, but whether she has a performing tendency and whether she will be an actress in the future is not something I'm concerned about at all. Although she is now enjoying a leisurely life, she may not be able to get all the fun that I went through before, or her life may not be as comprehensive as mine. But I don't want to see the god of destiny pointing Manley to her future. I am waiting for the natural order of things.</p>
<p>"I myself have been running around since I was a child, as the saying goes, growing up in a suitcase. According to child psychologists, children should be moved from place to place from time to time so that they can be lively, adaptable, make new friends, and be independent, not relying on others and not being afraid of difficulties. This may be true. But I may be a bit old-fashioned because I want Manley to have a stable life, which is also what I didn't enjoy when I was young.</p>
<p>A stable life, indeed, is what Helen Hayes has not enjoyed in her life and has been seeking day and night. Since the age of five, she has belonged to the public and has rarely enjoyed personal happiness, because the life of an actor is probably like this. Therefore, she said with emotion: "I am impatiently waiting for the time when I can retire and step into that sweet period called old age. Both my husband and I are looking forward to the arrival of old age. When that time comes, Keith (Helen's husband) will find a ridiculous photo and say, 'Let's hang this photo up. Manley's boyfriend will laugh to death when he sees it. At that time, wrinkled skin and white hair, old bear waddling; life's troubles, all become the past, the sunset years, are truly precious.'"</p>
<p>Movie Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e246">Review of "Rumba" <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Chan Fei</p>
<p>Rumba—Great Light</p>
<p>Among the usual song and dance films, this "Rumba" cannot but be called an outstanding work.</p>
<p>Although its content is inevitably mundane, merely a contrived fabrication of love material, the playwright has used well-versed film expression methods, making the emotional twists and turns between the male and female protagonists constitute a tortuous and bizarre narrative. From a new perspective, there is nothing particularly commendable, but for general audiences who need entertainment, it can make them feel satisfied. When the male and female protagonists meet for the first time while cashing lottery tickets, small conflicts arise. At the second meeting, the female protagonist is well-intentioned, but the male protagonist misunderstands and conflicts again, even causing him to lose his job. The third time, the male protagonist teaches the female protagonist a new dance technique, whispering intimately in the middle of the night, but she refuses to be any more unrestrained, causing him to become angry, even leading to another misunderstanding. The fourth time, the female protagonist goes to the male protagonist, originally to discuss marriage with great affection, but unbeknownst to her, the man has an ulterior motive. When sweet words and honeyed phrases and suspicions all disappear, another comes , (she is purposefully invited by the male protagonist for revenge.) Again, they are separated. Afterwards, the female protagonist passively returns home, and the male protagonist visits several times, but she ignores him, even though her love and hate are very conflicting and contradictory. All the way to the critical moment of life and death, the male and female protagonists finally truly fall in love in passionate dancing. With such a wavy plot, even this ordinary love dispute becomes extraordinary. The playwright's such rigorous structural power is indeed the highest expression of American love films.</p>
<p>What is even more noteworthy is the director's skill. At the beginning of the film, there are such extraordinary and lively shots, such a rapid tempo, expressing people's enthusiasm for lottery tickets. The same technique is used to handle the large-scale Rumba dance in the Cuban countryside, from monotonous to complex, from slow to fast, and finally extremely short CuttoCtu, complexly and chaotically weaving into a frenzied picture. Moreover, the enthusiastic music helps the enthusiasm and thickness of the air, which gives people a great interest in the enthusiastic customs of Cuba.</p>
<p>We must specifically mention the final Rumba dance on stage. He first used close-ups of many instruments, the conductor's caution and seriousness, arousing the audience's serious attention to the music. Then slowly the curtain opens, such a beautiful national case of the setting, such dim lighting, when people dragging shackles painful moaning out scene Several times the lightning flashes, the wind blowing the leaves tremble. As for the dance team of two women and one man, taking the stage together, the graceful dance poses, the passionate whispers of love, and the intoxicating music, everyone is intoxicated by it. All the way to the male and female protagonists embracing and taking the stage, in the midst of urgent feelings (because of worrying about the gangster's shooting) and passionate love, they successfully completed a brilliant scene. In this kind of place, we certainly will not ignore the efforts of the song and dance director and the composer, but the credit for the composition of the atmosphere cannot but be given to the general director.</p>
<p>In addition, we can also cite a few points to illustrate the director's proficiency; when the male protagonist meets the Cuban girl Camelia Tai, the director first uses another girl singing with the sound of the piano to describe the local scenery, and then from buying a three-dollar fan for five corners to attending the night dance, the humor of the time and the process of their acquaintance are all excellently handled. When the male and female protagonists dance late at night, the psychological depiction between the two can also be said to be extremely delicate. Therefore, this film, just in terms of the director, has already given us many good points.</p>
<p>Before, George Raft often played strong-character roles, but here, he appears with excellent dancing skills and unrestrained posture. As for Carole Lombard, we will not forget her hard work in "Twentieth Century Express," she is also suitable for playing strong-character actors. But what we like even more is Margo, who once showed her face in Peng Hequ's "Love in the Web," (Margo) The first time we meet her, she is a sincere and melancholy girl. She is passionately in love with a sinister lawyer, (Klaude Laines—CandeRainde as, namely the protagonist of "Battlefield Departure") When her lover abandons her, she is willing to sacrifice herself. In that film, we began to pay close attention to her, because her tone and posture were very outstanding. But it also feels that she is a bit too young, and the identity of the character in the play seems not very appropriate. Now she is appearing in "Rumba" again with the same posture. Although there are not many roles here, and she cannot give her full performance, she can indeed make people recognize that she has a great future.</p>
<p>However, it is a pity that so many excellent talents are gathered in this film, but they have not expressed a more commendable theme. Here, in addition to the conventional depiction of the love disputes between men and women, they are engaged in the exaggeration of form with the greatest strength. It is very obvious that from the male protagonist, the playwright's old-fashioned ideas are being expressed. We do not say that his departure from the life of a gangster is not appropriate, but his striving to go upstream and then combine with a rich girl, this just shows that the upward climbing of the gentleman's concept is ultimately vulgar.</p>

<p>— Pei Yuan</p>
<p>After talking about the issue of whether to suspend the school or not, the conversation shifted to the issue of the organizational method of the drama club itself. According to the results of everyone's discussion, the drama club's expenses would be temporarily advanced by Liu Rong, and the position of director of drama affairs was unanimously recommended to Meng Ou, and the position of the female lead would naturally be taken by Manna.</p>
<p>After the drama club was established, Meng Ou once asked Su Qiu to join their group, but Su Qiu resolutely declined with the sentence "My face will turn red and I won't be able to speak when I see people."</p>
<p>During the drama club's rehearsals, when Liu Rong saw the intimate state of Meng Ou and Manna, he said jealously to his designer, Lao Gao (played by Xi Liang): "I spent the money to let others have fun, Lao Gao, you are making fun of me too much"? But our Lao Gao replied with a very calm attitude: "I have my own wonderful plan, you just follow the plan, and I guarantee that it will definitely be successful."</p>
<p>After many days of rehearsals, "Goddess" was finally officially staged. Manna played the role of the goddess, and Meng Ou played the role of Qu Yuan. On the day of the official performance, Liu Rong brought a lot of people to support the show, and Qiao Jie and Su Qiu also came to visit. In addition, there were quite a few business students who expressed great admiration for Meng Ou's art.</p>
<p>After "Goddess" was performed, Liu Rong and Lao Gao ran to the backstage of the theater. At this time, Mona was removing her makeup behind the screen. From the crack in the screen, he saw Manna's thick and round sensual thighs, which stirred Liu Rong's heart. He boldly poked his head into the screen, but immediately retracted it.</p>
<p>Manna changed into her usual outfit and came out from behind the screen. Liu Rong was the first to say, "I'm here to congratulate you on your great success," Manna waited and replied: "Everything is your strength, I was just about to thank you." Liu Rong then smilingly scooped out a diamond ring from his pocket and put it on Manna's right finger, saying: "To commemorate this glory, I specially made this souvenir, please criticize it," Manna smiled and looked at Liu Rong, expressing her gratitude, so under the magic of this diamond ring, Manna devoted herself to Liu Rong.</p>

<h3 id="e248">The Construction of Affordable Housing (Part 1) <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Hao</p>
<p>…Points to Note…</p>
<p>The construction of affordable housing, after the Municipal Government's vigorous advocacy, will commence shortly. This is truly encouraging and fortunate for every commoner. It is a construction worthy of our admiration. Of course, for these new buildings, we do not hope they will be magnificent and luxurious, but at least we hope that they will be as well-equipped as possible within the feasible range. From what I can see, the following points must be given special attention before designing these new houses.</p>
<p>(1) Hygiene Problems—The most lacking facility in past commoner residences was hygiene. The low houses, with windows of less than one square foot opened on the walls, the damp mud ground, and the dark walls, were filled with foul odors. They simply did not resemble houses fit for human habitation. Furthermore, there were no toilet facilities. As a result, the surroundings of the houses were always full of excrement. All of this not only harmed the health of the residents but also affected passers-by, neighbors, and even the entire area. Therefore, when we design new houses, the first and most important thing to consider is hygiene. The most crucial thing is ventilation. The area of the windows must be appropriate to allow the air in the room to circulate as much as possible. The material for the floor should preferably be wooden or concrete, striving to be easy to sweep or clean. Toilet facilities are truly the most important. These toilets must be convenient and easy to clean. At the same time, in addition to private toilets, several public toilets should be set up, and their locations should be central.</p>
<p>Bathroom facilities seem to have been overlooked by every engineer in affordable housing. This is a great mistake. Bathing is truly the biggest problem in hygiene, especially for ordinary laborers who work hard all day long. Returning home covered in coal ash, if they could have a quick bath, it would be of great benefit to their health, especially during the summer when epidemics occur, which can be greatly reduced. Therefore, every house should have a bathroom. Such a bathroom can be very simple, for example, just a bathtub and a tap. Hot water can be supplied by themselves. However, the drainage of bathwater must have very convenient gutters, and this must be noted.</p>
<p>(2) Safety Issues—The most common danger in densely populated cities is fire. In the past, affordable housing, due to its interconnected nature, would spread rapidly once a fire broke out, making it impossible to rescue. We can see in the newspapers at any time that the number of commoners who perish in fire pits every year is considerable. The reason for this fire is mostly due to carelessness in using "portable stoves" or "wind stoves" for cooking. Most commoners have a difficult life and cannot afford to build a stove, so they have to use cheap substitutes such as "portable stoves." The application of these things is improper, and the danger is very great because they do not have ventilation chimneys. Therefore, in the new houses, each family should have a stove built for them in advance (a pot stove is sufficient).</p>
<h3 id="e249">Changes in Social Life and Architectural Styles <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Translated by Zhang Guangzheng from the Japanese of Taniguchi Chusaku</p>
<p>Architectural style is one of the symbols of the culture of an era, but it is also greatly influenced by materials.</p>
<p>The original materials of architecture were natural stone and natural trees, thus possessing their special styles. In places such as Egypt, Greece, and Rome, relying on the utilization of produced marble, beautiful marble buildings were built. The art of architecture was accepted, and its style was determined. This style is the main source of European architectural styles. This is called the architectural style of stone material utilization.</p>
<p>Conversely, in Japan, where forests are abundant and there are earthquakes, stone buildings are not developed, and natural wooden buildings have risen instead. The architectural style of Japan is a wooden utilization style.</p>
<p>Without special scientific treatment, but only utilizing the styles of natural wood and stone, the construction method is naturally extremely simple.</p>
<p>However, since the Industrial Revolution in the nineteenth century, scientific advancements have been rapid, and building materials have also been greatly affected. Because of the production of iron, cement, glass, etc., the simple architectural structure style of utilizing natural objects alone has been fundamentally changed. Due to the utilization of iron and cement, the steel frame structure replaced the old shield structure.</p>
<p>On the one hand, due to the research of mechanics, rational mechanical design has been applied to architectural structures. In the past, the huge, oversized columns and overly thick walls of stone and brick structures have been reduced to a certain extent, and the number of floors has been increased. The space occupied by the structural material parts of buildings has been reduced, becoming a style that utilizes vast space.</p>
<p>Moreover, buildings utilizing iron and cement are also earthquake-resistant, fire-resistant, and wind-resistant. The architectural style of utilizing natural stone and natural trees in the past, even if it is superior in art, is far inferior to the style of utilizing iron and cement in terms of practicality.</p>
<p>However, architecture is not satisfactory if it only meets practical needs. Therefore, various materials for decorating iron and cement have been scientifically researched. For example, for the beauty of the exterior, there is artificial marble; for indoor insulation, soundproofing, and beautiful materials, fiberboard, gypsum board, and wood veneers are used.</p>
<p>Today, the iron and cement machinery is not only practical, but also beautified by the production of various decorative materials. However, in the future, there will be a further requirement, that is, the research of materials suitable for hygienic equipment such as air washing, heating, soundproofing, and moisture-proofing, which cannot be delayed any longer.</p>
<p>In this way, on the one hand, buildings are containers for human life; on the other hand, the power of advancing science is used to satisfy the infinite desires of mankind. However, construction costs and equipment costs will inevitably increase further. The resulting result is that the difference between the poor and the rich in buildings becomes more and more obvious. This is an important social issue and cannot be ignored. Therefore, in addition to the research on building materials suitable for the magnificent and luxurious architecture of iron and cement, equally important is the research on new materials that are more affordable and have the purpose of resistance to moisture, earthquakes, and fire, in addition to iron and cement, for the lives of ordinary people, which is a necessary point in the research of building materials in the future. However, the supply of excellent building materials at low prices requires the unification of architectural styles. With a certain type of material, factories can then produce in large quantities. In Germany, the sizes of various parts of houses, windows, doors, etc., are unified in two or three types. That is, the architectural style is gradually tending towards simplification.</p>
<p>The famous material of a certain model of house is produced in large quantities by factories. When building a house, assembling and combining according to the drawings, this method is the shortcut to obtaining the cheapest and most beautiful house.</p>
<p>For this reason, the general public and architects should be aware. For the sake of everyone's livelihood, they should sacrifice their personal desires, not adhere to special architectural styles, but be satisfied with architectural styles that utilize unified materials.</p>
<p>If so, excellent buildings will be much cheaper than now, and the shortening of the construction period is even more unexpected. Relying on this, the damage of large earthquakes and theft can be reduced; and daily life can be made more hygienic. Then, health and economic conditions will also inevitably improve day by day.</p>
<p>I hope that people can understand this point as soon as possible, and that the needs and the architects can be satisfied with the architectural style obtained by using unified materials.</p>

<p>(4) Sulfur - Sulfur is very active. If it combines with iron in steel, it can form iron sulfide, which is a poor quality product that reduces strength and toughness. If it combines with magnesium in iron to form magnesium sulfide, it easily rusts the steel. Not only this, but steel with high sulfur content becomes brittle when heated to red hot. Therefore, it is only suitable to be 0.05 percent long, and beyond this, it is greatly disadvantageous.</p>
<p>(5) Mirror quality - Manganese is also easy to make steel hard, so it is only suitable to contain 0.4 to 0.72 percent. If the manganese content in steel exceeds 0.7 percent, its hardness will make it difficult for blacksmiths to work, and if it exceeds 12 percent, it can only be used as tools such as chisel stones and cannot be used for other purposes.</p>
<p>(6) Aluminum - Aluminum is a gasification barrier that can make steel rust-free and can reduce weight, but it is limited to a maximum of 0.05 percent. Beyond this, there is a risk of combining with carbon to form graphite. Aluminum steel is sold on the market, which is this.</p>
<p>(7) Chromium - The addition of chromium to steel can obtain great strength. There is a thing called "anti-force and great strength" on the market, which is this kind of chromium steel material. Its composition is best not to exceed 13 to 18 percent.</p>
<p>(8) Vanadium - Vanadium can also make steel strong and tough. It is mostly used in advanced industrial manufacturing, such as springs and axles, which are the best quality steel materials. However, the value is extremely high.</p>
<p>(9) In steel - When the quality in steel reaches 3.5%, it can make it strong and durable, and when it is 36%, it can be insensitive to strong temperature, so in the construction industry, it is used as a measuring ruler to make it accurate and unchanged, also known as non-expanding steel.</p>
<p>Section 2 Rust</p>
<p>In steel problems, rust is a very big difficulty, because after the pot iron rusts, it not only damages the force energy, but also reduces the beauty. As for the reason why it rusts, it should be explained by the two theories of being oxidized or thundered, but due to the relationship of space, I will not say more: the steel contains sulfur and manganese, which is more likely to rust.</p>
<p>The methods of preventing rust are no more than the following.</p>
<p>(1) Paint - Painting on iron can isolate it from the humid air outside, thereby preventing rust. However, the paint is easy to fall off, so it must be repainted every year to be cautious.</p>
<p>(2) Cement - Wrap the steel bone with two inches thick of cement aggregate, which can protect it every time.</p>
<p>(3) Pure steel - If the steel is refined purely, it will not rust. (To be continued)</p>
