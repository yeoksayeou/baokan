<h3 id="c18">河北經濟協會之發起 <a href="#c18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>— 端</p>
<p>河北經濟協會應時勢之需要。而以發起聞。參加者皆工商鉅子。在河北工商界具有悠久之歷史者。雖該會之內容若何。尙有待於章則之頒布。但鑒於環境之日非。柳江煤礦之强占。不覺對於兩國之能否合作。致其甚深之疑念。蓋合作美名也。合作能循名覈實。則彼此自以平等相許。若變相而言提携。已遜一籌。提之携之。隱然有强弱之分。亦步亦趨。尙何有自立之可言。竊以合作之道。一曰求互利。惟大家有利益。其利乃溥。二曰求互信。惟表裏如一。而誠信可結。三曰求互尊。毋恃强而凌弱。毋自尊而卑人。則可以共處。四曰求互容。不借題以發揮。不藉故以生事。則可以共行。五日求互守。不挾恃特殊勢力而違反成約。强取豪奪。往昔中外合辦之事業。中國人徒擁高位。享厚俸。置一切於不問。因而不但受制於洋副理。甚且受制於洋稽核之輩。事權旁落。太阿倒持。失敗之來。咎誠自取。外人正望中國人不辦事。而後可爲所欲爲。行所無忌。今則事變益亟。固不宜有此偷閒自廢之惡習。外人卽望我以原料相供給。而爲工業國作出品之尾閭。我亦不應作如是想。美國固盛產棉麥者。不聞美國之疋頭麵粉不圖自製而仰給於人。日本以絲經供給美國。不聞美國責日本人毋織絲綢。蓋欲立國於世。不能無農。亦不能無工。若動輒逞其忌嫉之私。無饜之求。責人以所不能。受之者亦惟有不避艱難壓迫。而自求生存耳。</p>
<p>日人對於華北經濟之企圖。屢有所揭橥。松岡洋右自就任滿鐵總裁。與關東軍協商後。卽作明顯之表示曰「對於華北經濟工作。與其拙而速。毋寗巧而遲。與軍部協力爲根本的全部調查。俟得充分之確信後。始見諸實行。」可見日人此後將以精深之功夫。作澈底之調查。俟有確實之把握。然後一舉而盡得其實。是卽所謂謀定而後動也。日人之處心積慮旣如是其深。而我國人猶染讀書不求甚解。處事不求深造之積習。安得而不失敗。在河北經濟協會進行期間。如何求周旋之方。策自全之術。誠國人所應加意努力者也。</p>

<p>（倫敦）意軍在意國北境之大操、現已告畢、而英法德三國現將踵起舉行秋操、以表演其武力、法軍大規模之會操已在昆連德意之邊界開始進行、總指揮為參謀部長甘木將軍、衆料其繼續操演時間將歷大半個月之久、同時德國已開始歐戰後最大陸軍會操、其陣綫起自孟却斯特、終於赫曼斯堡、參加者爲各種軍隊、備有最新式器械、總指揮爲克魯格將軍、會操時德元首希特勒與陸長白隆培將軍皆將前往檢閱、至於英國陸軍、則將至沙利斯堡平原作十三次之假戰、空軍亦加入焉、英法德大操時、他國陸軍隨員將同往參觀、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國今日開始舉行凡爾賽和約成立以後第一次公開表演之假戰演習、機關槍·軍用飛機·坦克車·及重砲等等皆在法國邊境附近演習、據稱此次操演係欲表演由法國邊境奮戰後退之方法云、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國空軍頃在勃倫斯維克城附近依照最新式戰略舉行大操、參預大操之飛機、分爲紅藍兩方、以歐爾勃河爲疆界、河以東爲「紅方」之領士、河以西爲「藍方」之領土、紅方不經宣戰、突向藍方襲擊、藍方聞警報後、甫經動員、敵機已侵入邊境、藍方乃力事防衛天空轟炸、勃倫斯維克各工業機關週圍均用高射砲保衛、入夜全區均熄燈、以避免成爲天空襲擊之目標、另有驅逐機一隊、擔任警戒、大操程序、首先爲防禦戰、繼則由防禦戰轉變爲進攻戰、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據負責方面消息、意大利陸軍兩師集中埃及邊界附近之西列內加地方、因此英意關係已日見緊張、最近當局决定不准外國軍艦駛入地中海之英屬瑪爾泰島、據海軍界半官式人士解釋、此舉係謀停泊瑪爾泰島英國軍艦之安全、實出必要蓋意大利艦隊進攻地中海島嶼、極爲迅速、如乘夜襲擊停泊瑪爾泰之軍艦、則尤爲便利、猶憶上次大戰時、意大利建造極小之魚雷艇、竟在波拉港擊沉奧國軍艦一艘、可謂前車之鑒矣、又軍事專家均以爲瑪爾泰島最易攻陷、蓋意大利飛機不過三十分鐘、卽可飛抵該島、如瑪爾泰島一旦失陷、則英國惟有佔領希臘若干島嶼、以作海軍根據地、與上次大戰時情形相同、一般人相信、英意一旦開戰、意國控制地中海之軍略地點、最初必獲勝利、然此項勝利、勢難持久、蓋地中海東西門戶、紅海與直布羅陀、均在英國掌握中、意國海軍不能越雷池一步、如是則英國可實施封鎖、以逸待勞、意國物質與財力兩俱匱乏最後必遭敗績、職是之故、消息靈通人士相信意國不能作持久戰、若在阿比西尼亞高原地帶用兵、曠日持久、不但無勝利把握、且國內日益貧困、甚且使法西斯制度、因面顚覆、此層墨索里尼當知之甚審、因此墨索里尼或竟見風使帆、但求意國權威獲得滿意、卽恢復談判、以求和平解决、亦非不可能云、（二日哈瓦期電）</p>

<p>（日內瓦）艾登與賴伐爾今日抵此後、卽討論國聯行政院明日開會手續問題、大約兩人將各發表言詞多少相同關於巴黎二國會議失敗事之文告、而不作共同官言、當巴黎會議時、英法曾向意國建議、將阿比西尼亞行政各部歸意國監督而改革之、並建議阿國應請國聯以各種專家助其整理內務、有關係之四國卽英法意阿應商訂新約、以代一九零六年條約阿國之經濟利源、連同礦產及天然利源、應加發展、阿國各行政部、包括交通郵政敎育司法財政、應以顧問之輔助而使新時代化、又建議應施特別計畫、保護意國之利益與僑民、並便利外僑居於滴宜之區域、此項建議均須由阿王與國聯贊同而阿國政治獨立與領土完整、應予保持、國聯各界以爲此項建議極爲寬大、今仍可供意國予以接受、意相墨索里尼前不加考慮、竟加駁絕、殊令人不解云、（三日路透電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）今晚赴日內瓦出席國聯行政院會議之英國代表團曾至法外交部訪問法總理兼外長賴伐爾、諸人面容、微有憂色、英首席代表艾登曾向賴伐爾詳述英政府對阿皇以油讓予權給予美國菲洲拓殖公司之態度、謂英政府與此項讓予權毫無關係、且未予以贊助、賴伐爾聞之殊爲滿意、今晚據英人各界聲稱、英法彼此諒解、較前爲佳、讓予權事與意阿間爭議正案、不致有何影響、艾登與賴伐爾今夜將同車赴日內瓦、對於國聯行政院會議手續事宜及提出巴黎三國會議報告書等、尚將續作討論、（二日路透電）</p>

<p>阿京　阿王財政顧問美人考爾生今日宣稱、菲洲拓殖公司無英國查本云、（二日路透社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）英國駐意大使德魯蒙正式向外次蘇維克聲明、關於阿政府煤油開採權出讓事伴、英政府事前毫不知情云、但負責方面宣稱、英政府之一再聲明缺乏誠意、因語氣旣屬含糊、又未涉及此事之核心也、英國之聲明僅稱、英政府對油礦開採權出讓一事、並不知情、但並未確切說明、此項發展、有背英國之志顧、故萬不能置其於英政府保護之下也、意人方面已公然認英政府至少與此事有間接之關係、據意國負責方面之意見、此項協定必須取消、以其不合法定手續也、意國無論如何不能容忍云、（二日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國不管部部長艾登今日告如法總理賴伐爾、謂李克特在阿比西尼亞所獲得之廣大油權、英政府事前並不知情、並謂英國對於阿國之利益僅在柴那湖區域、賴伐爾亦向英國聲言、法國之利益、亦僅在吉阿鐵路一帶、艾登與賴伐爾談畢後聲稱、李克特之行動並不能變更倫敦政府對於東菲危機之立塲、並謂李氏之背後純爲美國勢力、又據每日郵聞報吉布堤通信員消息、李克特本人亦謂承受讓與者爲一美國公司、其資本爲五千萬美金、據李氏言、不久美國公司主幹部卽將赴阿開始開拓工作云、（二日國民電）</p>

<p>防止走私</p>
<p>本人此次奉孔財長命、赴粵之任務有二、一爲商洽緝私問題、一爲視察粵省三年建設計劃之進行狀况、絕無政治上之關係、粵省於二年前、國稅每月收入二百萬至三百萬元、省稅每月收入六百萬至八百萬元、年來、則國稅每月收入减至一百二五十萬元、省稅每月减至四五百萬元、至稅收銳减之原因、係因緝私計劃、尙欠完善、加以粵省河道分歧、以致走私者日多、且走私者復多恃有勢力、更難防止、孔財長有鑒於此、特派本人赴粵、訪晤陳總司令伯南·及林主席雲陔·商洽一切、結果頗爲圓滿、現已决定、在粵省邊境、如廣州灣等處、指定防範走私區域、（Perventive　Zone）設立總卡於虎門、至於汕尾及深圳與九龍交界等處、增設分卡、以防走私、</p>
<p>視察建設</p>
<p>孔財長又以當茲不景氣瀰漫全國之時、粵省當局、仍銳意進行三年計劃、從事建設、以舒民困、因特派本人前往視察各項建設事業之發展、此行參觀工廠甚多、其中規模最大、功用最著者、厥為製糖廠、製糖廠共六家、每廠建築工程費六百萬元、現已有二家工竣、餘正進行、四個月後、均可完成、有十二萬畝之蕯田、供給此六家糖廠作原料、現已有二家間始製糖、品質遠勝太古糖、可與荷屬爪哇糖媲美、六家糖廠、同工作之時、明年產出品一千二百萬元、過去、我國購糖入超、年達二萬萬元、如此、可挽回利權十分之一矣、此外常參觀三繮廠、（紡紗織布絲織）及鋼鐵蘇打上敏十硫酸，各廠、所得印象甚佳、</p>
<p>書面報告</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄（宗海）譯</p>
<p>「你不可不十分仔細；注意你的舌，眼，和手，因爲這些都容易給人以不眞的印象」，裝先生有一次爲了這個引誘和乃德談話時這麼說道。</p>
<p>「我知道，我不是有意如此，可是這是便常得多，假如你不太頂眞的話。我以前常如此，因爲我怕爹和倪古老，現在我有時也不免，却因爲怕童子們笑我，我知道這是壞的，然而我忘了，」乃德說時，像是因了他的罪孽的迥憶，有不勝沮喪之概。</p>
<p>「當我是一個小孩時，我也常說謊話；呀，眞正豈有此理的謊話：後來我的老祖母倒把我醫好了——你想，她用什麼法子？我的父親和母親告誡我，責罰我，並且也對我哭過，可是我總要忘記，正如你一般。於是我親愛的老祖母說道，「我來幫你記牢，吧這點瓖脾氣斷它的根一，她說着就取出一把爍亮的剪刀，用棉花蘸着火酒，把它仔細刷爭，然後拉出我的古頭來，用她的剪刀刺舌的尖端，不消說立時鮮血直流。這眞是可怕，不瞞你說，可是對我有很多的利益，因為舌頭痛了好幾天，說話時每一個字來得很慢，因此我可以有時候去想過。以後我就謹愼起來，結果也好起來，因爲我怕那個大剪刀呀。可是我親愛的祖母在一切事上是最疼愛我的，當她遠在牛蘭堡故去的時候；還析福著小弗力子將裏能敬愛上帝，並且誠實做人，」</p>
<p>「我從沒有見過祖母，但是假如你想這法子可以治療我的毛病，我讓你川剪刀刺我的舌子罷」，乃德鼓着勇氣說道，他未始不怕痛，然而地也竭誠想停止他胡言亂道的惡習慣。</p>

<p>一座高牆，很堅固的立着，不知什麼時候，爬上來一枝附牆籐，接着，越生越多。暴風雨來了，牆坍下來了，籐也倒了。假如這座牆沒有籐附着，我想一定不會倒的，假使牆附着籐，要是沒有暴風雨，也不會倒得如此快。朋友！現在不是經濟的暴風雨時期嗎？你要生存在這世界，我要問你：你是不是依靠別人而生活？你有沒有力量支持別人的依靠？</p>

<p>— 銀楓</p>
<p>每天的工作以洗浴爲開始的人，每天的良好生活便從此開始了。假使他在洗浴的時候，唱幾句歌曲，或者哼幾聲京戲，更爲佳妙。發出來的聲調的力，平衡與否，可以不必顚倒，但是淸潔與歌唱卻要做成一種縝密的結合。</p>
<p>天大早晨洗一次港，永不間斷，好比常服一種滋補整個身體的補藥。皮膚上所受着的肥皂與水的動作，對於康健是一種强大的助力。用海綿吸了冷水摩擦是刺戟，擦後用毛巾來按摩筋肉，使血液流至全身各部，更加有力，並能刺戟內臟的器官，使它們的工作，有力地進行，洗浴是刺戟每一個毛孔，使它把足以傷害人們的身內廢物，儘量地排洩出來，而且能使皮膚對付氣候的任何變遷。</p>
<p>洗浴時唱歌，洗浴的人擴張他的肺葉，展開他的肋骨，按糜他的消化器官。他的心跳得更强健，疲乏的筋肉長得彈性而活潑，疲勞的神經，得到意外的精力而恢復原狀。所以，使一天的生活快樂，除了洗浴時的歌聲之外，沒有其他快樂的聲音了。使人增長精神，恢復疲勞，除了洗浴與歌唱合作之外，沒有最經濟最簡便的妙法了。</p>

<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>大街上的賣解的常把胸膛子一拍，大喊一聲「要錢不要命」，緊跟着，把身子在四面都是尖刀，不滿一方尺的刀框子裏蹟了過去。於是四周瞧的人，都拍手叫好，不由得不「花鈔花鈔」。</p>
<p>這一個塲面，本來是滑稽的，因爲那些尖刀，都是活動的，當賣解的躥過去時，早有站在框子邊的那大漢，按動機關，把刀頭都轉過去了。但是我每聽到「要錢不要命」時，總是不由自主的忘了滑稽的成分，而感到了這個生活問題的嚴重。</p>
<p>做强盜，在從前，是剮罪。在現在，弄得不巧，也得玩一下子鎗彈過身，性命不保。但是自古到今，强盜之衆，盜案之多，却是史不絕書，而且時至今日，竟有此業日盛之勢。再如製造販售紅丸毒品之類，一旦被破獲之後，槍斃的也有，監禁十年十五年的也有。槍斃，自然是沒有命了。長期監禁，可也就是九死一生。但是法網雖嚴，製造販運的，還是滔滔者天下皆是。難道這些人，都是不怕死的麼？唔，說穿了，就不過是「要錢不要命。」</p>
<p>鑛工，有被埋的危險。飛花工人，噴漆工人，不上二十年，都會害着肺結核。就是黃包車夫，據說，也是不能長壽的。但是幹這些營生的，還是沒命的要幹。這究竟是爲了甚麼？還不是「要錢不要命」麼？</p>

<p>一個襪廠裏老闆告訴我說：「現代的社會上，各業都感到沒落，潮流的趨向，委實太壞了！關於襪，是男女必不可少的，這可算得比較穩固的行業。豈知在現代社會上，也變了摒棄的物品，使營業大受打擊，眞是有苦訴誰知？」眼看許多摩登女子，裸露了健美的大腿，跣着雙跌，穿了同和尙所穿的芒鞋一般的鏤空皮鞋，自詡新式！這眞正沒有救藥了！幸虧有許多女子？因了脚跟上的凍瘡疤難看，我們就運用靈敏的腦筋，改造了一雙短襪，一經提倡，社會上流行，倒也很廣。皮鞋店的老闆，也幫了我們不少忙，出品了鏤空皮鞋以後，伊的襪破了是不雅觀的？必須要重買，這樣一來，生意倒挽回了一半。」我們看了上面的一番話，對於襪的問題，究竟應穿應廢呢？曾記得蘇州有某黨員呈請縣府禁止女子跣脚，以維風化，後有某女士加以辯護，閧得滿城風雨。</p>
<p>據我的意見。在新生活努力推行的現在了，跣脚是難免遭人非議，因爲男子們頸項間的鈕扣都要扣好？女子怎能跣脚呢？不妨想一個折中辦法，還是穿短襪的好。未識女士們可贊成管見？</p>

<p>介夫那裏有什麼話可說，只好苦笑了一笑。自己心裏只管在那裏划算着，這標語究竟得用什麼法子把它一張張的撕下來？想來想去，只有一個法子，待到夜深，旅客都安歇了，再去動手。那時就是有茶房看到，也不要緊，就說奉了專員的命令這樣辦的。自己想了一陣子主意，把房門掩上：心裏十分的懊喪。巴結闊人，碰釘子本來是一件極平常的事。但是像今天這樣，碰了釘子，不能了事，還要親自去撕掉標語，這實在倒霉極了。本來可以差茶房去辦這件事，但是這裏茶房，十分的勢利。以前以爲我是沒什麼能耐的人，不肯賣力作事。而今有了和藍專員有關係的迄點空氣，叫他們作事，他們必定大大的敲一筆竹槓。事到於今，也顧不了什麼體面了，到了夜深，還是自己動手罷。他心裏翻來覆去的想着，人却是東來西去的溜着。糊裏糊塗的，就熬到了黑夜。好在是預定了計畫，到夜深去撕標語的，光陰越快，卻合他的意。不過天一黑，心定了下來，偏是旅館裏的人聲，一時定止不下來。急得自己一會兒工夫在廊子下站了，一會兒工夫，又到前兩進大廳裏去看看。可是又不敢和賈多才見面，意思是怕他追間和藍專員接洽的成績。（三〇七）</p>

<p>後來才知道伊是爲着搽了鷄子淸的綠故，惟恐口腔的活動太過度了，要使伊臉上所結的一層鷄子淸膜裂了開來，失却應有的功效。這重鷄子淸大概在伊用過晚飯便搽上，一直要到伊上床安息前的半小時或四十分鐘才用肥皂和淸水抹去。</p>
<p>太后所用的肥皂是並不怎樣精良的，因爲伊不喜歡用打外面買進來的東西，所以這些肥皂也是派幾個太監給伊特地製下的。他們所用的原料是玫瑰花，或茉莉花的汁，合上幾種不知名的油類，凍成一塊塊花式不同的肥皂。這些肥皂的香味是很濃的，可是去垢滌汚的力量却不見高明，伊老人家倒並不以為沒用，很自滿地永遠這樣使用着。伊對於肥皂這一種東西的知識，確比其餘的一切洋貨來得廣一些，伊可以說出四五處西洋香皂的名稱；我也曾給伊弄到了好幾匣項上等的法國香皂，伊雖也表示很樂用，可是總說它們的香味還不及伊自己製的好。本來香皂的香味原有好幾十種，我所歡喜的未必太后一定也歡喜，伊歡喜的當然也不能適宜於我：祗是我想肥皂的好歹全在它的去垢濯汚的功用，何必定要斤斤於它的香味呢？無奈我這個話又是不敢和太后說的！（四〇七）</p>
<h3 id="c196">關於「雜纂」 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 汪放庵</p>
<p>前春秋中，曾刋有某君談及「義山雜纂」一文，於玉溪生此作，推崇備至，在茲小品女當令之年，第今之所謂幽獻刋物中，欲求如此詞意輕鬆之筆墨，而又盡爲人人欲道之世情語者，固未有也。「義山雜纂」，允千古矣！</p>
<p>按四庫全書本，雲間陸楫原輯：「古今說海」中，亦列有雜纂三卷，上卷卽爲「義山雜纂」，全文凡四十一條，文中所述，前某君已極盡介紹能事，茲勿贅錄，然其描寫世態，淋漓盡致之狀，想凡讀過此文者，必有我亦欲言之感也！其中又有「須貧」，「必富」兩條，且足爲世人借鑑，書諸紳亦未嘗不可，是更不僅以幽默見長焉。</p>
<p>說海所采中下兩卷，爲王君玉蘇子瞻續纂，王蘇皆宋人，所述並皆人人欲道之世情語。較「義山雜纂」，正無多讓，且可亂眞。如王氏續纂中有云：</p>
<p>「不濟事</p>
<p>將女嫁內官，飯後請吃茶，持齋日作客。無錢後斷賭。打殺人後戒酒，臨死許修善……」。</p>
<p>又如蘇氏續纂中有云：</p>
<p>「未足信</p>
<p>賣物人索價說咒，和尙不吃酒肉，媒人誇好兒女，妓別慟哭如不欲生，敵國講和」。</p>
<p>凡茲節錄，語語無不恰合世情，且多含有玄理。忽莊忽諧，筆墨至此，臻化境矣，今人有譯幽默爲語妙者，是眞語妙極點，近世幽默刋物中，能有此妙語乎？</p>
<p>關於此類筆墨體例，舊雜誌中，一鱗半爪，亦多有效顰之什，民權素各期，搜采尤夥。然以視李王蘇三公之作，瞠、乎後矣。世事波譎雲詭，而欲透澈人情者，蓋取而讀之。又奚止消閒己耶？</p>

<p>— 吳雅非</p>
<p>是一個「山雨欲來風滿樓」的上午，湄雄和我二個人，踏上了潤濕的街頭，有說有笑地在路上走着。經過了前墳頭，區公所，雙觀音堂，就到了馬村，再從那兒轉了一個彎，走過一條碎石補成的羊腸小徑，便是上鎭宮了。上鎭宮那條路是從田塍間面過去的，那邊兩傍全是一望無際的田野；許多農家夫婦正雙膝跪在稻中間拔草，佝僂着腰，低了頭，一行又一行的從淤泥里爬過去，他們經過的地方全給壓成了一條條的深泥溝。</p>
<p>「鋤禾日當午，汗滴禾下土，誰知盤中餐，粒粒皆辛苦！」我痴痴的站在田埂上望了許久，便想起了都市里的人吹白米飯，不知鄉下人種田的苦處，同時他們更不會想到一粒穀子的收穫是這樣困難的。</p>
<p>當我們到沈家塲上的時候，湄却遇到了一位親戚，所以不能同去，自顧回去招待那位親戚了。然而我們却不能將天王寺之遊作罷的，因此就和雄兩個人繼續地向着黃葉嶺前進。</p>
<p>過了沈家塲，從那兒過去全是煤屑路了。因爲這裏正是「成金煤礦」運煤的總滙。在黃晨嶺上有一條支路從山巓上通下來；那是到首鎭去的一條簡道。山上的上面還有一個週圍數十方里，茫茫煙波的天王蕩，那蕩的盡頭是在莘村灣，另一端却接到首鎭為止。蕩里滿植着荷花利菱，不過這里止有一艘渡船，那渡船去是一個二十多歲的少婦主待的，所以岸道雖比水路往返便利，然而却有一般人。偏要守着渡船擺渡的。</p>
<p>「眞奇怪，在山頂上怎會長一條河來的！「</p>
<p>「這是天地造化的玄妙，山用地形之持異；决不是人工所能做得到，也不是人們功能想得到的。」</p>
<p>走過了幾許石屋亂墓又爬上了一個土阜，從這里翻下去，一座頭山門　靜靜地站在面前了；可惜那「天王古寺」的四個大金字已經剝蝕得差不多祗剩了一些痕跡。穿出山門，就是「成金煤礦」的採煤所在：但是爲了主事者的辦事乖張的緣故，因此終于沒有把那煤礦卉得好一點，而現在非但已關門大吉，並且還害了一大批人，更破壞了許多地方！</p>
<p>這里是一條磚砌的大路，望那小溪邊的一片松林里走過去，就可望見那條慢長的小徑蜿蜓地直通至天王寺。</p>
<p>天王寺，除了東首那一列禪房還存在外，其餘像大殿寺都已變成了瓦礫堆了。雖然二世如來的佛龕頭頂還有二緣破瓦蓋着，但已日不擋太陽，夜不遮露水，就是殿前那兩口古井也早巳不會重波，而那兩株千年古松古柏，據說也是五年前因遭雷殛而成了枯焦木頭了。</p>

<h3 id="c198">理智與情感 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>如果我們把人類作個大略的分析，我們便可以說一部份的人是理智的，而另一部份的人却是情感的。又可以說理智是科學的，而情戚却是文學的。理智的人，與情感的人是絕不相同的，此如說我們讀了一篇戲劇，如果是悲劇，情感的人，便要落下淚來，而理智的人却無動於衷，他早有一個成見在胸中：「這是假的。」他也許還要笑那情感的人，說他是替古人担憂。理智的人，把宇宙間的事看成了因果，比如說一個理智的人看見一個兵打洋車夫，他在這時並沒有一種可憐弱者的心情，他覺得因爲洋車夫的弱，所以他才被打，如果他的體魄比他的雄壯，他一定可以打那兵的。比如說弱小民族之被壓迫，情感的人，便產出不少血與淚的文學，而理智的人却是在另一方作工夫的。他覺「弱食强食」是公理，如果要想不敎人家壓迫，必得有不敎人壓迫的能力。再舉一個例，比如蒼蠅是最不好的東西，誰都知道，理智的人便說蒼蠅非得把它完全捕減了不可。於是他見着蒼蠅便同仇敵一般，而情感的人却不大理會這些，有時也許因爲偶然打死蒼蠅而感覺極端的難受。英國的詩人布雷克（WilliamBlake）便是這樣，他有一首詩說：</p>
<p>「小小底蒼蠅，</p>
<p>你夏日的玩遊</p>
<p>我無心的手</p>
<p>擦損了你的生命。</p>
<p>我不是像你一樣</p>
<p>一個蒼蠅？</p>
<p>你不是似我一般</p>
<p>一個人？……</p>
<p>……」</p>
<p>因爲一個蒼蠅的死，他便會聯想到人生的虛幻，也是像蒼蠅般的，一個人在宇宙間誰說不像一隻蒼蠅？可是這在一個理智的人看來也許是不値一笑的。</p>
<p>理智的人的思想是固定的，無論什麼事不大容易搖動他的思想；情感的人却正相反，他的情感隨時改變，思想便也隨着轉變。他在喜悅的時候，看見的月亮是美麗的，光明的；在悲哀的時候月亮便變成凄凉的，昏黃的。在他鄉看見月亮他便說：「月若有情應識我，年年相見在他鄉，」在理智的人看來，何處的月不是一樣。李商隱的詩：「嫦娥應悔偷靈藥，碧海靑天夜夜心，」這種深入一層的詩，情感太濃原了。而理智的人看來，便覺得這話太虛無。「月是死球」，於是一句話把千古關於月的神話，文章和詩篇都完全推翻。所以一個詩人或一個文章家的思想和情感，絕不是一個科學家所能想象的。他在無聊的時候，也許可以幻想樹是他的朋友，有這兩句詩：「故人好比中庭樹，一日秋風一日疏。」他一閉上眼睛也可以看見深山，可以看見幽谷，這個樹林中有黃鸝鳥叫，那邊河裏有兩個漁舟，他又一閉眼，便又換了個樣子，這裏有個王宮，有一幢花園，有像靑氈似的草，有噴泉的水花，光輝的月映照着，那裏還有三四個美麗的宮女。他的幻想快得很。他把幻想用他的感情攙合起來，寫出文章便是美　的動人的作品。所以文學的成分便是情感，沒有情感，只剩下那美麗的外殼，是一點價値也沒有的，就像以上所說的那兩句詩，「月若有情應識我，年年相見在　鄉，」同布雷克的詩，如果將這詩中的情感提出，簡直只剩了幾句沒有意思的話。科學家不大會分析文學中的情戚，所以他們只感覺文學這種東西有點無聊。</p>
<p>提到文學中的情感，不由我想起了塞爾萬提司的吉訶德來。一般人都以爲吉訶德是一位很可嘲笑的人物，但我却認爲他是一個情感極濃厚的人，因爲他的情感太濃厚了，所以便把他的理智完全喪失了，一舉一動便覺得可笑。他用藍布條紮緊了他的面盔，到一個旅店，怎樣也不敎人將藍布條割斷，情願戴着那笨重的東西去睡覺，見了兩個妓女，他以爲她們是高貴的處女。她們給他卸甲，他覺得很光榮，於是唱到：</p>
<p>「天下騎士莫如我，</p>
<p>誰得美人服侍過，</p>
<p>像我吉訶德先生，</p>
<p>出得鄉來遇美人！</p>
<p>美人親來服侍咱，</p>
<p>公主來爲我執馬。」</p>
<p>這樣看來，他已經完全把理智喪失了。他只有熱情，只有像作騎士，像征服世間的魔道，替人抱不平的熱情。所以木製的人，在他的眼裏，會變成眞正的慕爾人，牡羊會成了騎士。屠格湼夫有一篇論到堂吉訶德的文章，他說：</p>
<p>「他一身的堅强的道德力的貫透却給與他的一切判斷，一切言說，及他的人格以一種特異的力量與偉大，不管他是如何的滑稽可笑，是如何的常常陷在卑辱的窮地之中。但道德給他的力量與偉大是依然存在的……堂吉訶德是「理想」的忠僕，是一位大熱情家，所以他也常被這「理想」的光華所照耀輝映而保有着榮光。」</p>
<p>吉詞德是一位大熱情家這是一和不錯的。我們沒有他那種熱情，所以看他作的事便覺得極其可笑，而他自己却以爲這事是很鄭重的，是非這樣作不可的。所以我們的文章詩篇，爲抒發我們的情感的作品，在一般理智的人看來，也許以爲是極可笑極無聊的吧？</p>
<h3 id="c199">說因緣（下） <a href="#c199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>不說那些抽象的理論，我來舉幾個眞實的史例罷，滿淸末年，資本主義的大潮向中國土地上衝過去，中國社會絕對不能保守老樣子，非變動不可；而且變動的速度和振幅，和資本主義在中國的勢力一同增高起來，這是必然的。但變動的過程中，有許多小緣，得留意一下。在戊戌變法之際，光緒帝如能先發制人，把慈禧太后囚禁起來，在庚子拳亂之際，列强實行把中國分劑掉了；辛亥革命的成功如不在武昌而在廣州暴動，或者武昌革命也還是失敗；或者淸帝不用袁世凱，或决計不讓位；這許多小綠的可能性和另一串小緣—光緒被囚禁，列强不風分中國，辛亥革命成功在武昌，淸庭用袁世凱，决　讓位—的可能性，是佔同等的百分比的。小緣的連續系統一有變動，中國的歷史就要換一種寫法了。所以研究歷史的和研究社會學的有點不同，社會學告訴我們一般的社會變動過程，歷史告訴我們某時某地某社羣的變動過程，必然論在這兒失去了效用了。近人梁啟超力主偶然論，他在南京講演研究文化史的幾個重要問題，全般否定因果律在歷史上的應用，說：</p>
<p>「歸納法最大的工作是求共相，把相異的屬性剔去，相同的屬性抽出，各歸各類，以規定該車物之內容及行歷何如。這種方法應用到史學，却是絕對不可能。爲什麼呢？因爲歷史現象只是『一躺過』，自古及今，從沒有同鑄一型的史跋，這又爲什麼呢？因爲史蹟是人類自由意志的反影；而各人自由意志之內容，絕對不合從同；所以史家的工作，和自然科學家正相反，專務求「不共相。」倘若把許多史蹟相異的屬性別去，專抽出那相同的屬性，結果便將史的精魂刺奪凈盡了。因此，我想：歸納研究法之在史學界，其效率只到整理史料而止，不能更進一步。』</p>
<p>隨後他又發表兩個大膽的結論：</p>
<p>一，「歷史現象，最多只能說是「互緣」，不能說是因果。」</p>
<p>二，只有「人類平等及人類一體的觀念，世界各部分人類心能所開拓出來的文化共業」這兩點可說歷史是進化，其餘只好編在「一沾一亂」的循環圈內了。</p>
<p>他的話固不無偏頗之處，但他批評必然論在歷史上的應用，頗値得注意。</p>
<p>我們從另外一個史例上又可以看見梁啟超一類主張偶然論者的缺點來。民國十五年間，北京有人提出「曹錕賣布出身，現在做了大總統」的口號，當作招募新兵的誘惑辭令。想出這口號的人，一定以爲「賣布出身」會做大總統是一個不可思識的奇蹟，彷彿買航空獎券一樣，碰巧中了頭彩。共實他們忽略了一串小緣的連績綫，我們把「北洋派」，「國民黨」，『研究系』這些政治活動的集團和民國實際政治的　　繫合攏來看，把曹錕放在北洋派裏，把曹錕在小站時入行伍的事實不要忽過，那就可以解釋賣布出身而做了大總統的因緣，也可以了解這事實並非奇跋了。現在許多史實，因爲史蹟已往，那一串小緣的連續綫不能重行湊合起來，只能讓必然論和偶然論者紛爭不已。概然論者就想在並非調停兩可納辦法之外，開闢一條解釋事實的大路來。</p>
<p>我們不能呌過去的史事，僅復演出一回；我們無法呌大家相信某一小緣若有變動歷史也換一種顏色的說法。我們只能找一種類似的事實來說明；，講數理暹種的，求之於賭博的下注；而我也把回力球的結局來說明「機遇」在歷史上的地位。要說這個，又棏有篇很長的篇幅，我現在只把我的結論說一說：</p>
<p>「機遇」（Chenece）和社羣的組織成反比；組織愈緻密，「機遇」愈减低它的重要性；組織愈鬆懈，「機遇」愈增加它的重要性。就歷史講，時代愈古，「機遇」在歷史上愈佔重要；時代越近，「機遇」越减低它的重要性。但世界上無論何國的歷史，决不能和回力球的成績相比；回力球可說有百分之九十五的必然性，而歷史上的或然性，遝佔百分之五十以上。</p>
<p>所以我們看社會各事件的構成，固然要注意必然的「因」，同時還得注意「槪然」的緣。</p>

<p>「多好玩嘍！」他們呌：</p>
<p>媽媽停脚一看，說不出的好處，不由得呌道：「哦唷！……」不住地咂嘴，搖頭。</p>
<p>小和尙搯了一枝菜花跑回來，小毛頭也就搯了一枝。小和尙說：「媽，住在這塊多好！」眼睛發着光。</p>

<p>媽媽說什麼，想什麼，孩子們不懂。抬頭看見飛過一隻喜鵲，兩個又跑上前去了。</p>

<p>「球有翅膀嗎？」小毛頭心裹想。</p>
<p>小和尙已經耐不住了，甩開兩條小腿就跑。</p>
<p>「哥哥！」小毛頭追上去。</p>
<p>「站住！不要跑呀！」媽媽一面追，一面襄，兩隻小脚擺出飛快的外八字。</p>
<p>可是小和尙再也不理他媽，只顧朝白粉牆那兒跑。球不住地跳，『通！通！」就像踢在他的心上。還有喀嘻哈哈的笑聲。</p>

<p>— 袁塵影</p>
<p>離開白靈廟的時候，是在一個淸凜的早晨。從冷冷的被中爬起來，我對這一個住了幾日的蒙古包不禁感到了一點留戀，那從包上圓頂孔露出臉來遮蓋蒙古大地的靑天，似乎也在對我作臨別的凝笑。</p>
<p>出了包外，天氣還十分早，不到穴點鐘的光景；太陽還隱在東山雲海中，淡淡的薄霧包園了北面的山頭，「鄂博」，蒙古包，有幾家炊煙和朝霧籠罩着河東的房屋。情晨的凉風颼溜溜吹過來，像冰彈打在人的面頰上，空氣似冰凍了般的沉寂，汽車一兩聲嗚嗚的呌聲，在和着悲嗚的原野的微風。</p>
<p>我看了看西面山脚下在淡霧中失去了光輝的白靈廟，不知怎地突地却感到了一點酸楚：爲了某一個原故我沒有機會去看這一個內蒙聖地中的大召廟，使我這個專誠來蒙古大地中看蒙古風光的年靑人，不得不携帶着一顆失望的心回去。可是，我也看得不少了：那到處的找「事」難的恐慌，那蒙古民族原始人式的生活……這一切蒙古風光我不是已經看得不少，聽得不少了嗎？爲什麼還要對一個常看見的像歸化舍力圖召（註一）式的白靈廟，一定要感覺到未看到的悵惘呢？</p>
<p>穿着笨重架裟的喇嘛們也好像知道我們要歸去似的。特地從廟前的坡上走下來。用一種惜別的眼光看我們，這時候，我們的男孩子在孩子們在沙地上站成了一個半圓圈，靜靜地聽許多拖着辮子的蒙古人擁着一位王公講括。一位光着頭的瘦年靑人給翻譯，翻譯的話語好像是在寒冷空氣中顫戰。我從人縫裏望過去。那一位拖着長辦子蒙古王公的話語，似一個輕小的鼓鎚打着腕弱的鼓面，聲音是那樣的低而堅定。隨後是一位我們男孩子的慷慨的講說，可是，我知道。這只是一時的義憤，過了些日子，離開了這個他們眼中認爲新鮮的荒凉大地時。我們的男孩子女孩子還不是一樣過他們的優悠生活去了？</p>
<p>男孩子說完了話。我們又分乘了原來的四輛大汽車，走上了歸途。男孩子女孩子們的唱歌聲高響起來。衝破了原哥中寒冷的空氣，東山背後的太陽巳露出一綫金光，沐浴淸，蒙古大地，每個人的手指都凍得屈不回來。鼻尖也有些凍得微微疼了。坐上了汽車，各個蒙古包前站着的帶着長辦子的蒙古人。一齊向我們揮着手，我們的男孩子女孩子們高舉着帽子，搖晃着，一齊高喊着新畢來的一句蒙古話。『塞邵，　邵』（註二）幾條蒙古狗狂　起來，像是在與我們送行。</p>
<p>汽車駛動了。四山下脚下的白靈廟和散落的蒙古包，河東的房屋一齊向後移動。這時候，我掉過頭去，心內充滿了各種滋味；急切間還看見那個蒙古包前的黃色旗子，在金黃色的陽光照耀下，隨風微微飄揚。</p>
<p>註一，「舍力圖召爲歸化坡中最有名之第一大召廟」。</p>
<p>註二，『塞邵，塞邵」係蒙人離別之語，意謂在得好，在得好！</p>

<p>— 吹</p>
<p>阿國讓予英美採油權</p>
<p>在此意阿戰雲密佈的今日，而阿國政府，突然以探油權讓予英美菲洲開拓公司消息聞，此事實堪令人注意者也，昨據路透電稱，阿王昨與美國台拉威州註冊之菲洲開拓公司，簽訂恊定，將面積逾阿國全部之半境內之礦產石油，歸該公司開採七十五年，該地毘連意屬索瑪里倫之土地，及伊里特里邊界之阿比西尼亞低地部分，咸在其內，羅馬聞此消息，大爲震驚。</p>
<p>此種事實，顯然對於意國以重大打擊，而足以引起意阿戰局事態的擴大，若以傍觀者—或第三者—之立塲言之，此種舉動，在阿爲投骨於南犬間之計劃，至少也爲與其給予侵略國之意國，毋寗給予友好之吳美，而在英美雖極力聲明此事談判，還在三年之前，但此時簽訂協定，究不免有趁火打刦之嫌，故意國負責方面宣稱，此種讓與，對於意國，自係非友好舉動，他日阿國收歸意國掌握時，意政府自未便承認其爲有效，總之阿國此種計劃，决不能變更意大利對阿行動之决心也云云·此種發言的意思，明明說意國此次對阿用兵，如果失敗，則不必說，如若勝利，則此種權利，决不讓兩國所獨佔。</p>
<p>不過我之所談，其目的並不在此，我之所欲談者？全係英美方面之態度問題，因爲英美兩國處此嫌疑之地，其發言之態度，自屬爲難，若謂對於此事，確有相關，不免失和平友好之舉動，若謂絕不相關，則他日爲意所佔，當然又成同題，其措詞殊爲不易，故觀近日兩國所發表言論觀之，殊有考慮之價値也。</p>
<p>自此次阿國發表採油權讓與菲洲開拓公司後，英國當局，便發表聲明，英政府迄今並未接到徵實之報吿，第覺不得不通吿駐阿京英國公使，若此說果確，則應通吿阿王，英政府爲盡其責任起見，應勸阿王收回成命，其言外之音，無非曰此係私人交涉之事，與政府絕不相關，不過政府爲盡其責任起見，聊盡勸吿之責，至勸吿之有效興否，則英國非所敢問也，又美國國務總理，對新聞界宣稱，美商在國外談判此種事件，向不先商請國務院，故政府並不注意國人在世界各處之行動，私人勾當，當非政府所關心云，觀以上二者所宣稱，便把此事推得一乾二凈。</p>
<p>惟美國在阿享有領事裁判權者，故美人之產衣學本身，均受美領事官管轄，美商旣獲此讓予權，則美政府負有保護此項權利之責任，事先豈有不注及此者，但國務院又表表示，謂我人所討論者，僅在目前，若將來意阿爭端解决後，美籍人民在阿執有合法財產權者，或將要求交戰國之一方，或雙方，暗償損失，則美政府不得不承認者也。</p>
<p>故據此以觀，他們的總意，便是現在商人的私人行爲，政府無權過問，若以後商人之利益，或有損害時，則政府不能不負其責任，故外交上之一言一語，表面上似極平凡，而其實多含有重大的意味，不過以後結果如何，當非言詞所消釋，尤有待於實力爲之解决矣。</p>
<h3 id="c203">趕場 <a href="#c203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— 尤其</p>
<p>—幾時才可以走完這遼遠的出路呢？</p>
<p>當山霧瀰濛着，統領了大地的時候，在伕頭的催促下開始的準備了一天的行程。在這里，假使你沒有力氣，或者在原有的力氣上有了缺欠的話，那，還是早點回去吧，這碗老米飯是沒有你的份見的。平均，每個人要有抬六七十斤，或者七八十斤的力量，說起來這重量並不算怎樣的重，但是，不要忘記那是「山路」，而且，在時間上，並沒有休息，除非在暮色吞沒了太陽，投身到客棧以後。</p>
<p>如果是在冷天，那末，由於衣服的重厚，在皮肉的磨擦上或許要好一點，偏巧，我們又趕在悶熱的夏天，伕子們的整個身體，除了下部有點遮掩外，其餘的全都赤裸着，當竹的槓子架上了肩頭，由於重量的壓積，使槓子不停的一掀一掀的動，肩頭的皮囱，由淡紅而深紅終至浸出了絲絲地血跡，在褐黑色的皮膚上。</p>
<p>—用具上，他們爲什麼不求改良呢？我想。</p>
<p>倘便能在子上搭一條軟厚的帶子，帶子的兩頭製成圈套，緊緊她嵌着槓子，這樣，一定有莫大的效益。</p>
<p>照舊的，我們在漫天的山野中走着，吆喝着，除了自我以外，彷彿沒有其他的存在。</p>
<p>由情形上看去，在今天，是有點不平常，山道上以至四野里，賣東西的忽然多起來，每個人都挾有忽急的神色，慌忙的往前迅速的走。看一下他們所携的貨物，花樣不像往日的單調了，在鹽巴鷄蛋以外，還有布匹和其他的什物。</p>
<p>——怎麼今日會這樣熱閙呢？我問。</p>
<p>——大槪是前面趕塲吧。張伕頭說。</p>
<p>——這里也有趕塲？</p>
<p>——多着呢，三天至多五天，就有一次。他說，帶了極平凡的樣子：說不定你一天之中也許能趕到二三次的。</p>
<p>讓時間輕快的在我們的頭上擦過去，一里，二里，在不經意的一瞥中溜走了，最後，停留在一個鄉鎭里。多怪自己不好，在當時忘記了打聽這鎭的名字，雖則牠給我的印象並不因時日的追逐而淡消下去，但，現在想起的時候，總是抱有遺憾的。</p>
<p>鎭里，正在集市的熱閙時期，由錶針的指示，知道已在中午了。</p>
<p>——就在此地吃飯吧，今天遇到趕塲，可以吃好點的菜。老黃提議</p>
<p>對於這種提議，我們當然都沒有反對的理由，停了下來，佉子們也都四外的散去。隨後，爲了想買點較好的菜蔬一喂下腸子，老黃和我從鎭的一端向另一端走去。熱閙包繞了整個的鎭子，喧囂的空氣是自從上路以後很少見過的。人，那末多，兩側的搬子簡直連成一條長的陣，沒有一點兒隙縫，雜糧，吃食，用物，各色都齊備着，趕塲的人也都懷了企望的心悄去尋求所企望的事物。</p>
<p>擠着，擠着，在人縫的當中，大槪是不常洗澡的緣故，一股汗酸的臭味，直撲進了鼻管。信了脚步，走進了一座大的廟子，同樣的，廟子裏也在擁擠着，拐進了第二重殿，淸靜了，在裏面，好像還有一個小學校的設立，也許是時間的不奏巧吧？學生不看見，只木的桌櫈無聲息的擺着。</p>
<p>在一個賣猪肉的攤子上買了點肉，這，要算是莫大的犒勞什，每天，拿豆腐花和鹽巴作爲下飯的唯一菜蔬，對於這並不豐滿的肉食，又該有如何的一種感念呢？</p>
<p>出現在鈸上的，女人並不在少數，不知怎麼，使我特別注意的，要算那穿花布衣裙的婦女了，那是苗婦。</p>
<p>苗婦，這算第一次和我行的見面禮，由她那日光爆晒下的皮膚，勁强的背負，都可以證明她們的勇敢，耐勞。</p>
<p>炒了一盤肉花，又弄了兩樣葷菜，並且，還灌了點酒，圍攏了那方的桌子，開始往嘴裏送着。桌子的外面，圍攏的比吃飯的人還多，瞪直了眼望着，也許在他們的心目中，要認爲是無限的豐富吧，我想。</p>
<p>不敢多有耽擱，揚起了前鋒的鞭子，在萬人的繞動中打開了一條路。</p>
<h3 id="c204">龔家堡的早晨 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>一輪滾圓的太陽，漲紅着臉纔從東方探起頭來的時侯，龔家堡的人，男男女女，大大小小全離了床在村子里浮動了。四大嫂這時也一角落從床上爬了起來，看看躺在擱鋪上的四哥，還呼呼地在打着鼾聲，他伸手開足的正像一頭死母猪似地：她輕輕地走過去推了他二下，他勉强翻了一個身，嘴里不知嘰咕了一些什麼，但却依然沉沉地睡着了。</p>
<p>「喂，好起來啦，田里的水你不打算車點出去，再上一次肥了嗎？」她猛的拍了一下舖板，「况且這是全村子里公議的，——這是「大家」車水，要是誰不到，就得罰方糕兩箱——現在時候已經不早，剛才阿德叔也來喊過了，廟塲上的鑼聲也早敲過了，家里又沒有準備錢在買方糕罰……」</p>
<p>她雖然也曾想到，男人近來被田里的這些勞苦工作磨礪得太辛苦了；車水，耘田，拔草，施初肥，……講到車水，在蒔秧的辰光因爲田里乾，所以要從外面去車進來，現在却反而要車出去了，老天爺不放人家省力些，這又有什麼法想，她雖體諒得男人的痛苦，但爲了要吃飯，就誰也不能够有一刻安逸，只好將每個人的汗血去灌漑那些稻，等到它結了穀子去還租米，完糧糟，自己最後祗留得些礱糠下來當飽。</p>
<p>「喂！」他坐了起來，扔了一個呵欠，接着又伸了一個懶腰，樣子像是沒有睡醒似的，「鐵已經敲過了嗎？怎麼我一些聲音也沒有聽到呢」！</p>
<p>「我喊了你半天你還不晚得，倒要　　　　聲啦！快去吧！我們方　是罰不起的。」</p>
<p>他磕　朦懂的揉了揉眼睛，站起來就打從後門里冲了出去。奔到田　頭已望見許多人先在了；大家全噪噪嚷嚷的閙成了一片，香樟樹下那部大水車上却正有十來個人在踏着。</p>
<p>「阿四你睡香了，到　麼時候纔來。」阿德叔坐在水車傍邊拍着潮烟說，口吻是有些責備的光景。</p>
<p>「你倒老早回去睡了，說寫意話，我昨夜車夜水也車到半夜過啦！牛也要吃不消這樣做法的，人倒底不是鐵打銅鑄的……」他有些不服氣似的說。</p>
<p>「好！不要多說，快上來替一班，要吃飯只好吃苦些！」於是一班人從車軸上走了下來，阿四他們上去接了班。</p>
<p>水車聲是轆轆轆的在這靜穆的空氣里播送，人們的談話聲也斷斷續續地在這週遭蕩漾，水儘一分一分的在田里少起來，那碧綠的秧尖也漸慚有些透出水面了。</p>
<p>最近龔家堡的每一個人臉上，除了原有的饑餓和憂鬱之外，却又添上了一層焦灼和疲倦，每一對眼珠子全彷彿似失眠症的患者，面色是已由白而變了靑。因爲自從大水跑進了這里之後，他們差不多沒有一夜安安逸逸的睡過。</p>
<p>咿呀！咿呀！水從田里吸起來，繞過了車板，由車嘴上噴出來，滔滔地冲入一條小渠里，再從那條小渠里流到村前那龔家河中，河埠頭却正有許多婦女在淘米洗東西，噠！噠！的搗衣聲是很野蠻地響轍了空間，隱約可以聽得從遠處山谷中送回來的迴聲，使這杵聲不至於因單調而感到寂寞。</p>
<p>「這眞是一番手脚兩番做，種秧的時候天乾得點水不下，一些瓜皮水還是要路遠迨迨的去從小浜里車進來，現在立了秋田裏用不着水了，反來了這麼一回大雨，害得又要從田里車出去，難道我們種田人就不應該省力些的嗎？」阿德婆婆一走到河頭，大家就講開了口。</p>
<p>「嘿！這里還算靠普薩的福，所以大水還沒有來着呢！你不聽見張道士往茶館里聽得來說，中國有好幾省已經給大水冲去了，死的人也不知多多少少。前天小學堂里的那位先生也說，東洋也淹去了不少地方，你聽聽看怕不怕！要是我們這里也來一下大水，我們逃到什麼地方去？哼！那我們一條命也活不成；現在雖然吃力些，但田終究還種了　。這因為我們村坊里沒有作過孽，因此苦薩來保佑了我們……」阿金娘子自以爲老世故似的說得那麼滿有勁兒。</p>
<p>「咳！現在世界是變了，人也越出越不入調；莫怪老天爺要降些災難下來，你看如今出來的小人，個個全有些像「小長毛」，將來說不定會造反的。本來老天爺怎樣會待錯人；不過倒帶累了那些好人也陪着遭難！咳！」子順太太總是痛心疾首的咒咀着現在這世界，她自己是一個好人，却活了這一把年紀還要來着那些壞人吃苦，自己想想實在有些悲哀！</p>
<p>水渦見慢慢地在這河面上消失，同時談話聲也漸漸地靜寂了下來，人也一個一個的離開了這河埠，村里每一家的烟囱上却都在吐着白烟了。</p>

<p>— 青雲</p>
<p>在藝華即將公映之新片「暴風雨」中的袁美雲，她飾着一個天眞活潑，充滿着靑春朝氣的姑娘，是一個非常美麗可愛的小鳥兒。</p>
<p>她很小的時候就失去了親愛的母親，她倚偎着她唯一的父親——魏鶴齡扮飾——在國外寄生着，很快樂的與她父親共同生活濟，他們沒有離開過一天，她的父親愛她熱誠，勝過那些價値連城的珠寳，决不肯捨棄她唯一的女兒。</p>
<p>爲了週遭的環境不容許他們再過着那樣美妙的生活，也是他們離別了祖國很久了，於是他們借這個機會裏，回到了他們祖國的上海，這一對相依爲命的父女心中皆這樣的幻想着：「我們有力量，我們有精神，我們回到祖國的上海，不一樣可以有事做？一樣甜蜜的過活着，何况。上海還有很有勢力的親戚可以帮助呢。」然而他們帶着這一顆美麗光明的希望的心到了祖國的上海，是被了出乎意外的事　　擊得紛　，遺一個　　的　　，隨着　個在掌　着肚皮的環境中掙扎着，而最後這個年輕的小姑娘是很可憐的死在敵人的炸彈下。呵！這不是正如一顆含苞待放的玫瑰，受了「暴風雨」的摧殘而凋謝了嗎？</p>
<p>朋友們，我想你們也很相信，像上而這樣的一個小姑娘角色，由袁美雲來扮飾，眞是冉適合沒有了，這樣的角色也惟有她才堪勝任的呢！</p>
<p>果然「暴風雨」試映的那一晚上，參觀的人誰都對於她演技讀美，然而當袁叢美握着她的手慶賀她成功時，她却這樣說道：「這是你指導我的成功呀！」朋友，你說這位小姑娘是不是聰明伶俐得很？</p>
<p>請愛好影藝的朋友們注意着「暴風雨」的公映日期吧，它就要公映了。</p>

<p>聽說最近有一家影片公司預備爲他的新片找一個「訴訟機會」。</p>
<p>所謂「訴訟機會」也者。並不是佈置一個誘姦案或强姦案，因爲這在電影宣傳方法上，是太陳舊了，現在的宣傳方法，是要出奇制勝，於是訴訟的對象便找到，「報人」身上。據說祇要對他們新片或是公司稍一不恭，便立刻和你「打官司」，好在官司並不要在必勝，祇要能轟動人，在轟動之後自訴撤消或是證據不足宣吿無罪，不都是可以嗎？</p>
<p>至淤「報人」方面，反訴是不會的，因爲預計沒那麼多的錢，即使提出反訴了，也不會有什麼罪的。</p>
<p>這不是挺好挺新鮮的宣傳方法嗎？你說。</p>
<p>記得有人說過，中國電影能够似他的宣傳那般進步得快，中國電影就有救了。</p>

<h3 id="c218">美汽車業鉅子惠萊士逝世 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 虞</p>
<p>美國汽車業鉅子惠萊士（I.　N.　Willys）於上月二十六日在美逝世。享年六十一歲。其一生奮鬥成功之經過。與法蘭西汽車大王雪鐵龍相彷彿。蓋亦企業界之有數人物也。而氏之最爲人所稱道者。乃爲其商業及組織上之能力。當其創業之始。困難備嘗。篳路藍縷。締造維艱。以一行將入於收管財產者手之破落公司。經其悉心闢劃。日有起色。卒成爲美國汽車大企業之一。謂非其才識過人。曷克臻此。氏與雪鐵龍誠爲禀賦出衆之流。今相繼先後謝世。亦彼業中　共引爲不幸之事也。</p>
<p>惠萊士於一八七三年十月二十五日生於紐約州之卡那台奎。早年卽以岐嶷冠儕輩。然不幸失怙。未能繼續攻學。年十七。棄學習業。初受僱於律師。以所入過菲。不久辭去。改銷脚踏車。獲利較豐。其後一年。所業殊順利。卽背離鄉井。至愛爾邁拉就賈。乃得盡展其長焉。惠氏貨殖之材。似係得自天賦。億則屢中。儕輩中咸以端木視之。是時因鑒於脚踏車業之方開其端。他日成就未可限量。乃傾全力以赴之。以一年方十八之靑年。具此銳利目光。自是難得。因於愛爾邁拉創設一脚踏車推銷公司。其常年營業達美金五〇〇，〇〇〇元之譜。惠氏一鳴驚人。籠中物固非久伏櫪下者可比。信夫。</p>
<p>是年爲一九〇八年。惠萊士於報章中得見廣吿一則。召人推銷印第亞那普立士哇浮蘭公司之汽車出品。其時哇浮蘭車係四汽缸者。較諸流行之兩汽缸者進步多多。公司創業六載。然其出品最盛之年。每歲不通四十七輛汽車而已。惠萊士卽願爲該公司効力。以總銷售自任。並計劃年產五百輛。當時管理公司事務者係派萊氏。聆惠萊士之議。不勝驚異。然而此議方磋商之中。風波忽起。公司當軸吿於惠氏。謂因受經濟上之艱窘。周轉不靈。卽將收歇矣。惠萊士聞之。急赴印第亞那普立士覘之。則見廠中除三數未裝配之零件外。已空無所有。蓋其時爲星期六日。而至星期一日。此公司卽將入於收管財產人之手中也。</p>
<p>惠萊士以機遇不可失。卽出其敏捷之手段。一方面與印第亞那普立士廠方商酌。一方面乞助於紐約及支加哥之友人。卒由其愛爾邁拉脚踏車公司董事處集得資金七千五百元。惠氏獲欵卽着手改組此公司。一九〇八年春。新組織日惠萊士哇浮蘭公司者卽吿完成。氏自任總理，司庫，營業主任三職。銷售進貨。事必躬親。其時美國之汽車事業。尙在草創時期。氏之慘淡經營。卓然於該業中放一異彩。而其本人亦頭角崢嶸。扶搖直上。惠萊士哇浮蘭公司得於最近之二十五年中。奮發有爲者。惠氏之功。誠足多者矣。</p>
<p>惠萊士淤印第亞那普立士創立惠廉士哇浮蘭汽車公司後。又因一家公司之失敗。而令惠氏之業得以增光。錦上添花。要以惠氏之商業天才獲之，蓋其時溥潑吐爾杜公司因遭嚴重之罷工而不能開業。惠氏見機卽着手於購買該廠之計議。然其友輩多與其意見相左。惠氏不爲動搖。卒於一九〇九年。以美金二八五，〇〇〇元購得之·大計吿成後。哇浮蘭廠卽自印第亞那普立士迷往吐爾杜。惠萊士哇浮蘭喬木鶯遷。人地相宜。其基業乃日益鞏固。廠址漸拓至一百十九英畝。巨厦九十座。面積廣至七，〇〇〇，〇〇〇方尺。職工約二三，〇〇〇人。</p>
<p>惠萊士除任吐爾杜廠主多年外。其在愛爾邁拉之業務仍不擺脫。蓋氏於其發祥之地。雅不願棄而不願也。氏因同時兼任惠萊士莫洛公司經理。氏於公餘之暇。喜集古玩珍物以自遣。其一生所收藏之美術品。爲値之鉅。冠絕哇海華區云。</p>
<p>惠萊士之於汽車事業。大略已如上述。然其海外市塲之拓展。功在國家。將爲氏一生事業彪炳之所寄。氏對於推銷美車於海外。曾數至歐洲。尤以其任美國國民汽車商會海外主任委員時爲甚。親劃一切。厥功殊偉。胡佛總統執政時。且以惠氏之熟悉歐洲悄形。特任爲駐波蘭首任大使。折衝俎尊。政節亮然。晚年隆遇。此尤汽車界中人所引爲殊榮者也。</p>
<p>惠氏於一八九七年娶於卡那台奎之雯蕙女士。一九二九年惠氏以股本出讓於銀圑。爲値數百萬元。</p>
<h3 id="c219">各國汽車廠營業近况 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 振民</p>
<p>（一）福特廠</p>
<p>福特廠近年來的營業。雖然生產方面的增加打破以往紀錄。但是物質的收獲。却很難令人滿意。該廠製造車輛。素用大量生產制。一個最簡單的車身，經過幾十個簡單的步驟。方纔完成整個車輛。這種制度的優點是迅速和簡單。但是一旦社會對於車輛的式樣變史。這種制度就蒙着重大的打擊。因爲牠不能够立刻更換。去適應社會的需要啊。</p>
<p>車身式樣變更的迅速。在這兩年間已登峯造極。「流綫」二字。差不多成爲每一家車廠的口頭禪。於是各式樣奇特的車輛。就發現在通都大邑。例如爬蟲式。魚雷式等等。其競爭的劇烈。殆數年前所罕覩。福特公司爲維持信譽計。當然也不能例外。但是因此而變更設計。改造機器。經濟上的損失。非常巨大。所以這兩年來福特公司的營業狀况。比較慘淡得多。</p>
<p>福特廠的精心傑構V—8汽車。在從前是風行一時。但是這兩年來的消路。返不甚旺盛。巨型車的銷路。顯然的很滯。雖然現在美國政府已减輕車稅。</p>
<p>目前銷路最旺的。要算十匹馬力左右的輕車。這種汽車的引擎。顯然的在逐漸改進。汽缸的壓縮比例。此較已大大的增加。活塞和汽缸。都用特種的合金製造。絕對沒有銹蝕的危險。散熱器。自動潤滑機等。都採用最新式的。車身內部和外表。都有很精美的裝飾。頗能吸引一般的顧客。據統計結果。一九三四年的輕車銷售數。比一九三三年增加百分之二十。預料本年將增加至百分之三十五。打破以前任何車輛的銷路啊。</p>
<p>（二）納喜廠</p>
<p>近年來進步最速的車廠。要推到一納喜」了。牠內部的組織。和製造的方針。都採用最新式的科學方法。又且工程師大都係富於經騐者。努力的結果。設計遂有顯見的進步。現在差不多成爲福特廠的唯一勁敵了。</p>
<p>納喜廠的十五至二十匹馬力中號車。銷路有與日俱增的趨勢。狹長而流綫化的車身。配以適當的比例。實在是引人入勝。引擎的構造。雖然沒有福特的玲瓏。但是牠的强度。却有過之無不及。引擎上各種附件的精巧。實爲任何汽車所不及。但是價格方面。比較的要貴一些。這都因爲資本的關係啊。</p>
<p>該廠一九三四年巨型車的銷數。比上年增加百分之三·五輛。中號車的銷路。增加百分之二十三。輕車則相差無幾。</p>
<p>該廠本年度曾開過一個盛大的廠務促進會。把所有的工程師。總經理。股東。顧問。和管理員會聚一堂。對於廠務的改進。討論恭詳。預料本年以來。對於製造方面將有新的發展啊。</p>
<p>納喜廠的瓷本。到現在止。已擴充至十餘倍於前。雖然在目前景况下。不能够和福特公司競。但是以增加的速率言。十年後必將成爲福特的勁旅啊。</p>
<p>（三）馬立斯廠</p>
<p>這兩年來營業狀况最發達的車廠。當然要推「馬立斯」了。據統計結果。一九三二年收入總額。較一九三一年增加一·三二四。五五六·元。一九三二年增至一·八九三·九五一元。一九三四年則爲二·五三四·九八〇元。預料本年度將有更顯著的進步。這種增加的迅速。實在是任何車廠所不及。</p>
<p>馬立斯廠在前數年間。專致力於輕車的製造。十匹馬力左右的小車。久已被一般人所歡迎。近年來更注意中號車的製造。引擎裝置的優良。式樣的精巧。殆其他車輛所不及。車身是極端的流綫化。</p>
<p>巨型的馬立斯」車。銷路雖然不及小車及中車。但是因爲配置的精良。也頗能行銷各國。價格方面。已漸慚减低。這也是車稅减輕的結果啊。</p>
<p>（四）德國各廠</p>
<p>德國各廠的營業狀况。也有很顯著的進步。去年僅引擎一項。銷數已達美　九。三五〇一二〇元，其餘附件的價値。當然要很大啊。Daimler汽車的銷路。已打破已往一切紀錄。德國車廠近年來所出的汽車引擎。就是式樣新巧。佔據地位極小。但是馬力却很大。並且車輔雖經過很長距離的行駛。可以不用去注意牠。近年來Daimler新車。幾暢銷全世界。</p>
<p>各車速率的增加。已足驚人。最高述率。每小時達二百英里。雖然車身行駛這樣的快。但是沒有振動及傾覆等現象發生。這種優良的彈簧制。實在是很値得讚賞的。</p>
<p>其他國家的車廠。雖然營業上比較進步。但都沒有超越的現象。尤其是英國的車廠。也許因爲「保守」性的關係。對於牠們的車輛。沒有多大的改進。式樣也來得陳舊一點。這對於銷路方面。當然要遜色了。</p>

<p>汽車業的本身。具有一種神秘的力量。因爲汽車才發明的時候。人們都以爲是殺人的魔鬼。而現在任何人覺得汽車是人類所不可缺少的東西。有很多人以爲近年以來。汽車在構造方面的進步。是足以减少肇禍案件的。其實汽車肇禍案件的多少。要看男女司機人的居心如何。自從汽車風盛以後。各國汽車路先後興築。而近年來爲之汽車這樣東西。分外的安穩和神速。竟把火車的地位奪去。然而汽車雖是在一天風行一天。駕駛汽車的人。如果缺少了道德心。那麼肇禍的案件便會一天多似一天那是必然的。過往有人說汽車的所以要傷人害命。唯一原因。就在行駛在道路上面。可以任意的左右前後。不像火車有一定的軌道的。可是現在人們已證明這種說理是錯誤的。假如我們駕駛一輛汽車出去。時常小心翼翼。防止肇禍。那麼决不會傷人害命的。就英國說來。近年來交通當局對於道路的安全問題。非常注意。所以有「靜聲運動」的實行。同時關於汽車的註冊。司機人的登記也非常的嚴格。本來一個良好的司機者是不會在路上肇禍的。無論在鄉村或城鎭之中。行駛汽車的時候。决不會任意的加速。雖然有很多肇禍事件並不因司機的不愼。而因爲道路的本身有所缺點而發生的。但良好的司機者。他們會選擇道路。事前可看出將有禍患發生而設法避去的。</p>
<p>換句話說一個良好的司機者。時常會謹愼從事。力避一切禍患。同時更熟知道路的情形。譬如某處地方。有孩子在遊玩。某處地方。有電車上走下來的人。道路的上面。所有危險的地帶。他們全都知道的。這些都是駕駛汽車者的常識。如果缺乏了這些常識。那駛車外出。便很容易　禍了。駕駛汽車。事實上是一種技術而並不是科學。一個人駕駛了一輛汽車到外面去。第一要遵守行車的規則。同時更要顧到道德問題。那麼就不致肇禍了。就以汽車業方面說來。他們對於良好的司機者。也極端的歡迎。有了良好的汽車。更要有良好的司機者。才能使汽車的優蹟完全表現出來而不致肇禍。否則還是收不到什麼效果。就道路方面說來。最近像美國倫敦的當局。限制汽車在街市中行駛速度。至快不得超過三十哩。也是防止汽車肇禍的一法。甚多車主購買汽車的時侯。注意到安全問題。不但自己要安全。就是路人也希望他們安全。因此在這種悄形之下。各汽車廠最怕是男女司機者時常肇禍。爲的是多一次汽車肇禍案件。多嚇掉幾個顧客。而汽車肇禍案的低落。在反對方面。足以鼓勵或吸引顧客去購買汽車的。</p>
<p>汽車廠方面。對於這種眞理。是絕對相信的。單就英國說來。各汽車廠製造汽車。對於安全問題是非常注意的。其目的無非在求汽車的安全程度增進而後。可减少肇禍案件。肇禍的紀錄低落之後。足以鼓勵或吸引顧客多購些汽車。英國的車廠。首先採用安全玻璃。四輪塞車。甚至在最小的汽車上面。盛油箱也放在後面。傳動系統的改進。各種裝置都是基準以上的出品。這些改革之中。每一種是救活了不少人命的。所以什麼都是値得刋在廣吿裏面。新式的車胎。和二十年前的車胎相形之下。無疑。可救活不少人命。新式的車燈。能够使其暗淡的。同樣具有减少禍案的作用。甚至風鏡上面的開關。也具備特殊的價値。在人類的歷史上。汽車的安全程度。恐怕無過於今日。英國的汽車。安全穩快。的確　稱獨步。不　這種優美的成績。要有良好的司機者。才能表現出來。否則還是同樣的容易肇禍呢。</p>

<h3 id="e1">Executive Yuan Meeting Passes Regulations for Governing Rivers, Redefines Boundaries of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei Provinces, Appoints Chen Shaokuan as Admiral, and Hu Shize as Representative to the League of Nations <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held its 228th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 3rd. Attendees included Wang Zhaoming, Kong Xiangxi, He Yingqin, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Gongbo, Wang Shijie, Huang Musong, Chen Shuren, Liu Ruiheng, etc., with the Yuan President chairing. The following resolutions were passed:</p>
<p>(A) Appointments and Dismissals: (1) Resolved that Zhang Zheng, a member of the Xikang Provincial Establishment Committee, be replaced due to illness, and Ren Naiqiang be appointed as a member of the Xikang Provincial Establishment Committee. (2) The Minister of Foreign Affairs, concurrently held by Wang, submitted a proposal to replace Gu Weijun, the representative to the 16th League of Nations Assembly, who could not attend due to unforeseen circumstances, with Hu Shize, the envoy to Switzerland, as the representative. The resolution was passed and forwarded to the Central Political Council. (3) The Military Affairs Commission requested the appointment of Chen Shaokuan as Admiral, first rank, Chen Jiliang and Chen Xunyong as Vice Admirals, and Lin Guogeng, Zeng Yiding, Wang Shouting, and Li Shijia as Rear Admirals. The resolution was passed. (B) Discussion Items: (1) Minister of Finance Kong proposed that the nation has been facing difficulties in recent years, with frequent natural disasters. The Yellow River basin has long been plagued by water disasters, and the Yangtze River, a region of wealth, has suffered two major floods in four years. If fundamental remedies are not promptly sought, the vitality of the nation will be depleted. Therefore, two measures, addressing both the symptoms and the root causes, have been proposed for public deliberation. The resolution was passed and reported to the Central Political Council. (2) Vice President Kong proposed that the provincial boundaries of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces on the north bank of the Yangtze River are irregular and overlapping, causing many constraints on administrative measures, especially in water conservancy administration. The collapse of the main embankment of the Mahua Dike below Hankou this summer was due to improper provincial boundaries. It is proposed to redefine the provincial boundaries of the three provinces in that area, using the Yangtze River as the boundary, and to order the Ministry of Interior and the governments of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei to promptly consult on measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. Resolved that the Ministry of Interior and the governments of Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei should promptly consult on measures and submit them to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation. (3) Minister of Finance Kong proposed that ten provinces, including Jiangsu, Anhui, Jiangxi, Zhejiang, Hubei, Henan, Fujian, Shaanxi, Ningxia, and Chahar, have reviewed and submitted the budgets of their subordinate counties and cities to the Ministry in the twenty-fourth year. The rest are still being processed or reviewed. It is proposed that after the submission, the Ministry will select personnel to go to various provinces for thorough inspections to obtain accurate county and city budgets as a fundamental basis for supervising local finances and to stabilize county and city budgets. Four implementation measures have been proposed for public deliberation. The resolution was passed, and the Executive Yuan will request the National Government to issue a clear decree to publicize the measures for the orderly implementation of county and city budgets. (4) Minister of Finance Kong submitted the Jiangxi Provincial Government Finance Department's short-term treasury bond regulations for the twenty-fourth year for review and implementation. The resolution was passed and forwarded to the National Government for record. (5) Acting Chairman Wang of the Peiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee telegraphed that the committee has been closed down as ordered, and requested instructions on where to assign the Cultural Relics Reorganization Committee, which was originally under the committee. Resolved to be referred to the four ministries of Interior, Finance, Education, and Railways for review and reply. (6) Acting Chairman Wang of the Peiping Political Affairs Reorganization Committee telegraphed that the Agricultural Cooperation Enterprise Committee, which was operated by the committee, should be assigned to another department. Resolved to be under the Ministry of Industry. (Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Content of the Proposal for Treating Both Symptoms and Root Causes <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong drafted measures to treat both the symptoms and root causes of river water disasters. The Executive Yuan meeting on the 3rd has passed his proposal. The summary of the measures is as follows: In the past ten days, Director of the Dredging Bureau Song Ziliang, Chairman of the Yangtze River Water Conservancy Commission Fu Rulin, Secretary-General of the Economic Committee Qin Fen, and Chinese and foreign engineers were summoned to carefully discuss and plan the measures for treating both the symptoms and root causes, in order to prevent water disasters and benefit water conservancy and transportation. Even though the national finances are difficult, and the project is expected to be costly, it is necessary to overcome difficulties and prepare in a timely manner.</p>
<p>(A) Addressing the Root Causes: (1) Yangtze River: (1) Dredging and Guiding: The riverbed of the Yangtze River is silting up, reducing its capacity. The estuary downstream is also becoming shallower due to silting, hindering discharge. Therefore, it is essential to conduct a comprehensive survey and separately dredge and guide the river to increase the effect of concentrating water flow and scouring sediment, enabling smooth discharge. The Shanghai Dredging Bureau has achieved effective results in treating the Huangpu River. It has been instructed to work with water conservancy experts to prepare an engineering plan and budget. (2) Returning Farmland to Lakes and Returning Farmland to Rivers: The Yangtze River from Guanchang to Chenglingji, a distance of about 230 to 240 nautical miles, has more than 50 silted sandbars. The Yangtze River did not suffer from water disasters in the past because Dongting Lake had a large capacity. Recently, the capacity of Dongting Lake has been reduced due to siltation. Local people have also built embankments on the sandbars, competing for land, resulting in a shrinking lake area. Other marshes have similar situations. This is a major cause of floods in the Yangtze River. During the flood of the 20th year, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated returning farmland to lakes, which was a fundamental and essential idea. The Economic Committee is now drafting two principles: (1) River farmland, lake farmland, and beach land that obstruct the flow of ordinary floods, and lakes and marshes that encroach on the storage capacity of ordinary floods, should be abandoned. (2) River farmland, lake farmland, and beach land should be retained except for those that should be abandoned according to the above regulations. It is now planned to make overall plans and implement them separately according to this method. The necessary funds and fundraising methods are to be determined as follows: (1) Yangtze River Dredging Surcharge: A 3% surcharge will be levied on import and export goods from the Jianghai Customs to the Chongqing Customs, which will generate approximately 5.6 million yuan per year. (2) Transportation Surcharge: A 3% surcharge will be added to railway, steamer fares, passenger tickets, postal services, and telegrams. (3) Land Tax on Both Banks of the Yangtze River: Land that has been affected by disasters will benefit greatly after the water disasters are fundamentally cured. It is proposed to levy one dime per mu after three years. (2) Yellow River: Many Chinese and foreign experts have made suggestions for treating the Yellow River, but all of them require excessive funding and cannot be implemented. Therefore, the treatment of the Yellow River has always been about patching up and correcting shortcomings, with few fundamental solutions. It is now proposed to plant trees and forests along the Yellow River from the upper reaches to Zhengzhou, as well as alfalfa, to solidify the soil on both banks. Build embankments on both banks downstream of Zhengzhou to the sea, strictly regulate the slope, and plant trees and forests uniformly within the embankments to fix the riverbed and control the flood volume. Concurrently, conduct a comprehensive survey of the upper and lower reaches. At necessary locations, divert water and open channels to guide the river in sections, adopting a relief method to relieve congestion and increase capacity. After more than ten years, not only can water disasters be reduced, but also droughts can be prevented. It is proposed to instruct the Economic Committee to properly draft measures and budget for approval and implementation.</p>
<p>(B) Addressing the Symptoms: The methods for treating the symptoms are nothing more than resuming work and blocking breaches, which are handled by the Economic Committee. According to Qin Fen's assessment of the actual needs, the following measures are proposed: (1) The total area flooded by the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers this year reached 40 million mu. There were 21 breaches in the main embankment of the Yangtze River and 8 breaches in the main embankment of the Xiang River. All 27 breaches are in Hubei province. (2) The Zhongxiang Third and Fourth Work Sections in Hubei have the largest breaches, and regular blocking and construction are being planned, but construction has not yet started, requiring more than 1 million yuan. (3) Five of the other breaches in Hubei have been blocked, and 21 are being blocked, requiring a total of more than 500,000 yuan. (4) Hubei has only 170,000 yuan in embankment funds left, and the funds needed are more than 1.5 million yuan, which is not yet available. However, it is planned to find a way within the embankment funds. (5) The main embankments and important civilian embankments along the Yangtze River in Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces have suffered a lot of damage after this major flood and must be restored to their original form at a minimum, with a cost of about 6 million yuan. After the water disaster, the financial branches of the provinces have difficulty bearing all of them. (6) It is proposed that the central government allocate a special subsidy of 2 million yuan for the restoration of the main embankments of the Yangtze and Xiang Rivers, and the embankment restoration project should be handled by the water conservancy authorities of each province. (7) There is only one breach in Dongzhuang on the Yellow River. The flooded area in western Shandong is about 12 million mu. The previously estimated cost of blocking the breach was about 1 million yuan. It is proposed that Lu Han telegraph for 3 million yuan. It is currently being planned and estimated in detail. (8) The levees of the Yellow River in the three provinces of Shandong, Henan and Hebei must be reorganized. In addition, the provinces of Ningxia, Suiyuan, and Shaanxi have also suffered heavily from the Yellow River floods, and the required post-disaster construction funds are at least 4 million yuan. (9) Regarding the two items of blocking breaches and repairing embankments of the Yellow River, it is proposed that the central government allocate a special subsidy of 2 million yuan, which will be distributed to the provinces for responsible handling. (10) The above subsidies for blocking breaches and repairing embankments on the Yangtze and Yellow Rivers require a total of 5 million yuan. The treasury is in dire straits and it is difficult to bear the cost. Issuing public bonds would be difficult to raise funds. The funds raised by the above-mentioned measures to address the root causes cannot be raised immediately. The previous proposal to suspend the salary increases and promotions of railway, postal, telegraph, customs and salt affairs service personnel for one year was agreed by the Ministry of Transportation, etc., to be used for this project. The Ministry of Finance's proposal for the customs and salt affairs audit offices to donate all the funds for salary increases and promotions within the budget for the 24th year, and to instruct the railway and transportation ministries to do the same. The funds obtained should be used for both construction and relief. (Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<h3 id="e3">Disaster Relief Measures Issued to Counties Along the Canal, Dangerous Signs Have Appeared in the Middle Canal, the Water Level in the Salt River is Very High <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The water level in the Salt River is very high. Two salt boats, including those of Wu Xiangfu, were forced to sink under Xin'an Town these days. (Special dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Today, the water level rose slightly by 2 centimeters to 36.78 meters. The kilns and dormitories have each risen by 4 inches. The flood control office issued 11 articles of disaster relief measures to the counties along the canal, because the breach at Lu Huang is not expected to be blocked soon and the water level in each section continues to rise. Dangerous signs have appeared in the Middle Canal. It is briefly stated that a gong should be sounded to signal danger, the county magistrate should immediately report by telegram, and lead the people, laborers, soldiers, and police to rush to block the breach. Meanwhile, the hemp bags, lead wire, and other materials within the county should be sealed up for borrowing. If there are not enough, nearby civilian houses may be demolished for use. (Special dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Huaiyin Commissioner Wang Depu has shifted the focus of Yellow River defense to the Middle Canal. Pizhou County is pessimistic about the situation in its jurisdiction. It has united local officials and gentry to establish a Yellow River defense association and telegraphed the provincial government to present its views. (Special dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Li Canal Salt River's six ponds and seven rivers have risen sharply. The Salt River is now level with the canal's edge, and the canal water is close to the bank. However, since the 2nd, the water in each river has had a moldy smell, indicating that the water from the bottom of the upper rivers and lakes has been pushed here, or that old dams on the upper reaches have collapsed, and the water smells of rotting firewood.

<p>(Xuzhou) The Bulao River embankment in Henan suddenly collapsed on the morning of the 3rd in the Koujian area of Wadianzi in eastern Xuzhou. The water rushed down and surged towards the Six-Liang District. Upon receiving the report, the Special Office immediately ordered the officials and people of Tongshan to rush to block the breach. Representatives of the Xupu agencies and the Yellow River Defense Association visited the Second Division Tax Police Corps on the morning of the 3rd to offer condolences and presented 30 pigs and 500 dozen towels. The Xuzhou authorities believed that although the Chedao Kou had been blocked, the Yellow River surge was too strong to be guaranteed. They issued a notice to the citizens to sound the gong as a signal and immediately mobilize the entire population to protect the embankment. (Special dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) A telegram from western Shandong informed Xuzhou that the Yellow River's second flood had shifted to Zhu Kou, causing the Fourth Dam to collapse. Officials and people were rushing to block the breach, but the danger had not yet passed. The Zhu Kou Embankment, the Northern Embankment of Juancheng, and the Xuzhuang Embankment were all in extreme danger. If that breach collapses, the main surge of the Yellow River may seize the old channel and flow eastward. Please order your subordinates to pay attention. (Special dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The breach in the Wutun embankment north of Xuzhou has not been blocked and is 30 yards wide. The water flow was quite rapid on the morning of the 3rd, flooding both sides and attacking the back of the embankment. The situation is critical. County Magistrate Wang Gongyu rushed to Wutun on the night of the 2nd to personally supervise the blocking of the breach. Due to the rapid water flow, blocking was difficult. An additional embankment was built behind the embankment on the morning of the 3rd to enclose the water. The county government sent a large batch of materials and sacks to the scene for disaster relief at noon. (Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) At 7:00 AM on the 3rd, the Bulao River embankment was breached by the Yellow River water for more than 20 yards. The water head reached 2 meters high and poured southwest. In a short time, it flooded more than six or seven li outside the embankment. About a dozen villages outside the embankment were flooded. The Sixth District urgently reported to Xuzhou that the situation was critical, and more than 100 villages in the eastern Xuzhou Sixth and Ninth districts would suffer a catastrophe. Please find a way to provide relief quickly. (Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, Secretary-General of the Economic Committee Qin Fen, Director of the Water Conservancy Department Zheng Zhaojing, Technical Specialist of the Water Conservancy Department Wu Youxin, Counselor of the Ministry of Finance Li Qingxuan, Shandong Petition Representative Li Zhili, and attendants, etc., took a special train to Xuzhou and Juancheng at 8:00 PM on the 3rd to inspect the situation of the Yellow River breach and the disaster situation in Jiangsu and Shandong. They will also meet with Li Yizhi, Kong Xiangrong, and Han Fuqu in Juancheng to discuss Yellow River relief matters and return to Beijing on the 5th. The Standing Committee of the Economic Committee will then be convened to decide on emergency Yellow River relief measures. Kong said before his departure that this trip to the north to survey the Yellow River water situation and disaster conditions is scheduled to last for two or three days before returning to Beijing. Regarding the Yellow River water situation, northern Jiangsu is the most severely affected. Therefore, after inspecting Xuzhou, he will transfer to Juancheng. Before his departure, he received a telegram from Chairman Han, stating that he had departed from Jinan to Juancheng to await the meeting. Therefore, he decided not to go to Jinan before his departure. The various items stipulated in the Yellow River and Yangtze River governance measures passed by the Executive Yuan today will not be paid from the disaster relief public bond funds but will be raised separately. Qin Fen said that on this trip following Minister Kong to survey the Yellow River water situation, the itinerary will pay special attention to the changing positions of the Yellow River water. Minister Kong is a member of the Standing Committee of the Water Conservancy Commission and presides over national water conservancy. This trip to the north will determine the Yellow River governance and disaster relief methods after Minister Kong's inspection. The trip will return to Beijing around the 5th. (Special dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi and others are scheduled to go to the Wanzhai Dike in northern Xuzhou to inspect the water situation and levees after arriving in Xuzhou. After a brief stay, they will transfer to Juancheng to inspect the trend of the Yellow River water invading the south and the situation of implementing the Economic Committee's telegram to Shandong Chairman Han Fuqu, requesting him to dig open the Juancheng civil embankment within five days to release water. (Special dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Governor Fuqu is scheduled to take a morning train on the 4th to the south to meet Kong Xiangxi. (Special dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Li Yizhi, chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, took the Tianjin-Pukou train to Jinan on the evening of the 3rd to meet with Han Fuqu to discuss breach blocking work. He will stay for two days and transfer to Beijing to discuss Yellow River management issues with the Economic Committee. Li previously suggested to the Economic Committee that the water from the Juancheng Yidi be flooded by Huanghuasi and returned to the correct flow. The Economic Committee approved this method, and Shandong is adopting this strategy for breach blocking. (Special dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Kong Xiangxi is scheduled to arrive in Jining at 7:30 AM on the 4th to investigate the disaster. (Railway telegram, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi, a member of the Standing Committee of the Economic Committee, had previously gone to the Yangtze River to inspect the disaster. The situation of the Yellow River water in Jiangsu is serious, so he returned to Beijing from Shanghai on the morning of the 3rd and took a special train north at 8:05 PM to continue surveying the Yellow River disaster situation. Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the Economic Committee, Zheng Zhaojing, Deputy Director of the Water Conservancy Department, Chen Mingge, Chairman of the Tianjin-Pukou Railway Committee, and Li Qingxuan, Counselor of the Ministry of Finance, accompanied him. Kong told reporters before the trip that he plans to first inspect Xuzhou to observe the situation of the Yellow River water invading the south, then go north to Yanzhou and Jining to observe the Yellow River flooding. Han Fuqu has telegraphed an invitation to meet in Yanzhou. It is undecided whether to climb Mount Tai to meet Feng Yuxiang. If there are no special delays, he plans to return south by the original train five days ago. The issuance of disaster relief public bonds is still being planned. The measures for treating the symptoms and root causes of water disasters passed by the Executive Yuan on the 3rd all require funds, which will be raised separately. Qin Fen said that on this trip north to survey the Yellow River water situation, he had telegraphed the Shandong Construction Department in advance and requested that Li Yizhi and Kong Xiangrong be informed. They may be able to meet in Yanzhou. Shen Baixian, Director of the Jiangsu Construction Department, is already in Xuzhou and will be able to listen to his flood prevention report. Shandong and Jiangsu will be able to seek a concrete solution to the Yellow River prevention measures on this trip. Chen Mingge said that the water near Yacun on the Tianjin-Pukou Railway is about to reach the tracks, and the water near Hanzhuang has reached the roadbed. The entire line is still unobstructed. The railway bureau has made every effort to assist Shandong and Jiangsu in flood prevention. In addition to assisting Shandong with 6,000 cubic meters of stone and Jiangsu with 7,000 cubic meters, it has also dispatched engineering personnel to transport and assist. The recent noteworthy point is the inability of the embankments in northern Jiangsu to be broken by the water, and they are making every effort to rescue them to prevent the sinking of Xupu and the interruption of the Tianjin-Pukou line. As for the business situation of the railway, there has been an improvement this month. The railway is maintained by the authorities of Mongolia, Hebei, Shandong, Anhui and Jiangsu provinces, and the railway administration has made significant progress. (Central News Agency, 3rd)</p>

<p>(Jinan) The Economic Committee telegraphed the provincial government, strictly ordering the Juancheng area to harvest the sorghum within five days and dig up the Juancheng civil embankment to release water into the river set to reduce the disaster situation in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. Today, the provincial government meeting resolved to order the breach-blocking conference to reply. However, there are thousands of hectares of good farmland inside the set. Today, disaster-stricken representatives from the four counties of Juancheng, Fanxian, Yuncheng, and Shouzhang, including Wang Yide, went to the provincial government to petition against digging up the embankment. Han promised to transfer it to the central government and the Economic Committee. The provincial government was told that according to letters from the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the Huai River Conservancy Commission, the maximum flow rate of the Middle Canal for discharging Yellow River water is only 500 cubic meters per second. Please consider the overall situation and divert the Yellow River water flowing into Nanwang Lake through Dongping Lake and return it to the Yellow River, and quickly block the breach, or first divert the river or hang the water with mud. The Provincial Construction Department was instructed to handle it. Han ordered the Construction Department to draft work-for-relief measures for the disaster victims. The situation in Zhu Kou is still tight. River Bureau Director Zhang Lianjia told Han that he would live or die with Zhu Kou and requested an allocation of 100,000 yuan for disaster relief. (Special dispatch, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The county representatives in the set held a meeting today and decided to request the Central Government, the National Government, the Economic Committee, Ding Weifen, etc., to the effect that digging up the Juancheng civil embankment to allow the breached Yellow River water to enter the river from Huanghuasi is the worst policy. Not only will hundreds of thousands of lives and tens of millions of properties in the five counties of Juancheng, Yuncheng, Fanxian, Yanggu, and Shouzhang be destroyed, but if 200 miles of government embankment collapse, more than ten counties, including Dongping, Wenshang, Miyang, Ziyang, Qufu, Taian, Changqing, and Feicheng, will be turned into swamps. The Tianjin-Pukou line is also in danger of being cut off. Please withdraw the order quickly and immediately allocate a large sum of money to block the breach to value the lives of the people.

<h3 id="e19">The Inauguration of the Hebei Economic Association <a href="#e19" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c19" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">19</a></h3>
<p>— Duan</p>
<p>The Hebei Economic Association has been launched in response to the needs of the times. The participants are all industrial and commercial magnates with long histories in the Hebei industrial and commercial world. Although the content of the association is yet to be revealed with the promulgation of its regulations, given the deteriorating environment and the forced occupation of the Liuhe Coal Mine, one cannot help but have deep doubts about whether the two countries can cooperate. Cooperation is a beautiful name. If cooperation can live up to its name in reality, then both sides will treat each other as equals. If it is transformed into so-called "support," it is already a step down. To "support" implies a division of strength, with one side leading and the other following, leaving little room for independence. The way to cooperate, in my opinion, is: first, to seek mutual benefit. Only when everyone benefits can the benefit be widespread; second, to seek mutual trust. Only when there is consistency can trust be established; third, to seek mutual respect. Do not rely on strength to bully the weak, and do not be self-important and belittle others; then we can coexist. Fourth, to seek mutual tolerance. Do not use excuses to exaggerate or create incidents; then we can work together. Fifth, to seek mutual adherence. Do not rely on special forces to violate agreements or engage in forceful seizure. In the past, in joint ventures between China and foreign countries, Chinese officials merely held high positions and enjoyed high salaries, ignoring everything else. As a result, they were not only controlled by foreign deputy managers but even by foreign auditors. Authority was lost, and the order was inverted. The failure was undoubtedly self-inflicted. Foreigners hope that the Chinese will not handle affairs so that they can do whatever they want and act without restraint. Now that the situation is increasingly urgent, we should not indulge in this bad habit of laziness and self-abandonment. Foreigners even want us to supply raw materials and act as the rearguard for industrialized countries. We should not think that way either. The United States is indeed a major producer of cotton and wheat, but we have not heard of the United States relying on others for its cloth and flour instead of manufacturing them themselves. Japan supplies the United States with silk, but we have not heard of the United States demanding that Japan not weave silk. To establish a nation in the world, it cannot be without agriculture or industry. If one constantly indulges in jealousy and insatiable demands, demanding the impossible from others, those who are subjected to it will only have to overcome difficulties and oppression and seek their own survival.</p>
<p>The Japanese have repeatedly revealed their intentions for the economic development of North China. Since taking office as President of the South Manchuria Railway, Yosuke Matsuoka, after consulting with the Kwantung Army, made it clear that "for economic work in North China, it is better to be clumsy and quick than to be skillful and slow. Cooperation with the military is essential for a fundamental and comprehensive investigation. Implementation will only begin after sufficient confidence is gained." It can be seen that the Japanese will put deep effort into thorough investigation and will only act when they have a firm grasp of the situation, which is what is meant by "planning before acting." The Japanese are so deeply scheming, while our countrymen still have the accumulated habits of reading without understanding and not seeking deep study when handling affairs. How can they not fail? During the operation of the Hebei Economic Association, how to seek a way to maneuver and strategize for self-preservation is something that our countrymen should pay attention to and work hard at.</p>
<h3 id="e20">Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota Preparing to Finalize Policy Towards Britain; Desiring Britain to Open its Territories for Compromise; Talking Only About Economic Cooperation with China is Meaningless <a href="#e20" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c20" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">20</a></h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Since the beginning of August, Foreign Minister Hirota has repeatedly met with Ambassador to Britain Matsudaira to discuss the issue of adjusting Japanese-British relations. As Commercial Attache to Britain Shinjiro Matsuyama has been ordered to return home and will arrive in Japan on the 5th, a policy towards Britain will be established, and Ambassador Matsudaira will return to his post in Britain to actively work to adjust relations between the two countries. Foreign Minister Hirota plans to meet with Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British Special Envoy for Chinese Economic Affairs, around the 10th to exchange opinions for reference. It is reported that the most important aspect of the Japanese government's fundamental policy towards Britain is the demand for active cooperation with British influence, that is, that Britain should monopolize territories rich in resources and sparsely populated around the world, protecting British capital, while closing its doors to Japan, which has a large population and lacks resources. This is not a viable way to establish world peace. Britain should open its territories to Japan, actively implement the principle of equal opportunity and the open door that Britain has advocated in the Far East, in order to seek cooperation between Japan and Britain. (3rd Japanese Alliance Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday's editorial in the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, titled "The Fundamental Problem of British-Japanese Relations Regarding Mr. Leith-Ross's Visit to the East," discussed the following: If Britain does not have a proper understanding of Japan's current economic and population problems and does not make an effort to resolve the fundamental problems of survival for both countries with a truly understanding attitude, but only seeks coordination on the point of economic assistance to China, it is meaningless. The Japanese nation's position is to develop overseas, which is completely the same as the fate that Britain has experienced in the past. Japan's population and its goods, like Britain's territorial expansion throughout the world, will advance in all vast and sparsely populated areas, which cannot but be said to be in accordance with the laws of nature. However, the British Dominions and colonies have all closed their doors, prohibiting immigration and adopting extreme measures to resist Japanese goods. This is a well-known fact to the world. Britain has neither the generosity to open its territories nor the audacity to advocate the principle of equal opportunity and the open door. As for issues such as economic assistance to China, it advocates British-Japanese cooperation. This kind of behavior of restraining Japan is an extreme example of contradictory policy. Japan cannot but regard seeking economic development overseas as the most peaceful means of survival. If the British government still refuses to settle its past prejudices and errors and merely hopes for cooperation tightly linked to economic issues, it should be impossible.

<p>(Washington) Walden, Research Director of the Foreign Policy Association, issued a report today, strongly advocating that the US dollar, the French franc, and the gold pound should establish an agreement on stable exchange rates as soon as possible, and advocating the restoration of the gold standard to remedy today's chaotic currency situation. However, the report argues that after the stabilization of the currencies of Britain, America and France, the currencies of other countries can be disregarded. According to Mr. Walden, the result of currency devaluation in various countries will inevitably force the countries of the Gold Bloc to implement inflation. Therefore, in order to achieve international monetary stability, the gold standard must first be able to resume its normal activities. Finally, Mr. Walden believes that countries should abandon their economic nationalism in order to facilitate the flow of goods and capital. (2nd National News Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Brussels) The funeral of the late Belgian Queen was held today, the scene being extremely solemn. When the hearse went to the church, 150,000 veterans lined the road, silent.

The funeral will be held at 11:00 AM tomorrow, without military honors.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Eleventh Congress of European Minorities opened here today, with a total of forty delegates participating, chaired by Dr. Wuelffen. Dr. Weber has been Chairman of the Congress for many years and is a representative of the Slovene and Croat minorities within Italy. Representatives of the German minorities in Estonia, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary, Romania, and Yugoslavia also attended. Wuelffen said in his opening address that the situation of minorities in most European countries would deteriorate, especially for minorities in authoritarian countries. Mussolini declared last October that whether Italy and Switzerland could continue to maintain friendly relations depended on whether Tessin could maintain its Italian identity. Wuelffen supported managing the protection of minorities in all regions based on the same principles. Frank, the German leader in the Czech Parliament, declared that the ethnic group he represented was absolutely loyal to the Czech government and its democratic system, and was prepared to form a constructive government with the Czech majority and other minorities, but hoped that the other side would also show the same sincerity.

The leader of the party, Henlein, recently delivered a long speech in Bor, near Saaz, before 50,000 listeners, fiercely attacking the Peasant Party led by State Minister Malik Peter, stating, "We oppose, the original used construction policy, to this day, the need for construction is even more evident. The opposition policy we are pursuing has thus become an active opposition policy." Henlein also demanded that the government take action to alleviate unemployment, which is particularly prevalent in the German-speaking regions of Bohemia, "The government should launch a large-scale international relief effort to save our compatriots from starvation."

<h3 id="e29">British, French, and German Autumn Maneuvers <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(London) The Italian army's large-scale maneuvers in northern Italy have now concluded, and the three countries of Britain, France, and Germany will follow suit and hold autumn maneuvers to demonstrate their military strength. Large-scale maneuvers of the French army have already begun on the border between Kunliande and Italy, with General Ganmu, the Chief of Staff, as the commander-in-chief. It is expected that the maneuvers will last for more than half a month. At the same time, Germany has begun the largest army maneuvers since the European War, with its front line starting from Meng Quesite and ending at Hemansburg. Participants include various armies, equipped with the latest equipment. General Kluge is the commander-in-chief. During the maneuvers, German leader Hitler and Army Chief Bai Longpei will go to inspect. As for the British army, it will conduct thirteen mock battles on the Salisbury Plain, with the air force also participating. Army officers from other countries will attend the large-scale maneuvers of Britain, France, and Germany. (2nd Reuters)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany today began the first public performance of mock war exercises since the establishment of the Treaty of Versailles. Machine guns, military aircraft, tanks, heavy artillery, etc. are all being exercised near the French border. It is said that this exercise is intended to demonstrate the method of fighting and retreating from the French border. (2nd National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Berlin) The German Air Force recently conducted large-scale maneuvers near Brunswick according to the latest strategic tactics. The participating aircraft were divided into two sides, red and blue, with the Oerl River as the boundary. The area east of the river is the territory of the "red side", and the area west of the river is the territory of the "blue side". Without declaring war, the red side suddenly attacked the blue side. After hearing the alarm, the blue side had just mobilized when enemy planes had already invaded the border. The blue side then worked hard to defend against air bombardment. High-altitude artillery was used to protect the industrial facilities around Brunswick. At night, the entire area was darkened to avoid becoming a target of air strikes. Another squadron of fighter planes was responsible for guarding. The procedure for the maneuvers was, first, defensive warfare, followed by a transformation from defensive warfare to offensive warfare. (2nd Havas)</p>
<p>(London) According to responsible sources, two divisions of the Italian army are concentrated in Cyrenaica near the Egyptian border, so the relationship between Britain and Italy has become increasingly tense. Recently, the authorities decided not to allow foreign warships to enter the British-owned Malta in the Mediterranean. According to semi-official naval circles, this measure is necessary to ensure the safety of British warships anchored in Malta, because the Italian fleet's attack on the Mediterranean islands is extremely rapid. If they attack the warships anchored in Malta at night, it will be even more convenient. It is also recalled that during the last World War, Italy built extremely small torpedo boats, which sank an Austrian warship in the port of Pula. It can be said to be a lesson from the past. Furthermore, military experts believe that Malta is the easiest to capture, because Italian planes can fly to the island in just thirty minutes. If Malta is lost, Britain will only be able to occupy some Greek islands as naval bases, which is the same as the situation during the last World War. Generally, people believe that if Britain and Italy go to war, Italy will initially win control of the strategic locations in the Mediterranean. However, this victory is unlikely to last, because the east and west gates of the Mediterranean, the Red Sea and Gibraltar, are all in British hands. The Italian navy cannot cross the minefield. If this is the case, Britain can implement a blockade and wait for work to be done with ease. Italy's materials and financial resources will both be exhausted, and it will eventually be defeated. For this reason, informed sources believe that Italy cannot fight a protracted war. If it uses troops in the Abyssinian highlands for a long time, not only will there be no guarantee of victory, but the country will become increasingly impoverished, and even the fascist system will be overthrown. Mussolini is well aware of this level. Therefore, Mussolini may even take advantage of the situation and restore negotiations for a peaceful resolution, as long as Italy's authority is satisfactorily obtained, which is not impossible.

<p>(Paris) The Italian-Ethiopian Reconciliation Committee has decided on the Walwal conflict and subsequent incidents that neither Italy nor Ethiopia bears moral or financial responsibility. (3rd Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It is expected that the important meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council tomorrow morning to discuss the Italian-Ethiopian dispute will be able to give Italy some comfort. The first item on the agenda is the report on the Walwal conflict submitted by the fifth arbitrator, Baledis (Greece). The report has just been completed and it is said to be completely in line with Italy's position and places the responsibility for the invasion on the local Ethiopian army commander. The Ethiopian Emperor has stated that if the Ethiopian army commander is indeed at fault, then Italy should be fully satisfied. Therefore, it is hoped that Italy's initial victory will soften its attitude, and then the negotiations will proceed smoothly. According to the report, at the Paris Three-Nation Conference last month, Britain and France were willing to place Ethiopia's postal, police, transportation, and communications under Italian control, but Mussolini firmly rejected this, saying that this proposal was not enough to compensate Italy's wishes. Tomorrow's meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council will be chaired by the Argentine representative, Ginas, a well-known jurist and author who is also proficient in biblical studies. The first representative of the countries to arrive was the Italian Foreign Ministry's Loga, who arrived from Rome last night with a large number of official documents on the Ethiopian issue. (3rd Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) After Eden and Laval arrived here today, they discussed the procedures for tomorrow's meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council. Roughly, the two will each make statements that are somewhat similar to the statements regarding the failure of the Paris Two-Nation Conference, but they will not make a joint official statement. During the Paris Conference, Britain and France suggested to Italy that the administrative departments of Ethiopia should be reformed under Italian supervision, and suggested that Ethiopia should invite various experts from the League of Nations to help it reorganize its internal affairs. The four countries concerned, namely Britain, France, Italy, and Ethiopia, should negotiate a new treaty to replace the 1906 treaty. Ethiopia's economic resources, including mineral and natural resources, should be developed. Ethiopia's administrative departments, including transportation, postal service, education, justice, and finance, should be modernized with the assistance of advisors. It was also suggested that a special plan should be implemented to protect the interests and residents of Italy, and to facilitate foreigners living in suitable areas. These suggestions must be approved by the Ethiopian King and the League of Nations, and Ethiopia's political independence and territorial integrity should be maintained. All sectors of the League of Nations believed that these suggestions were extremely generous and could still be accepted by Italy. Prime Minister Mussolini rejected them without consideration, which is very puzzling. (3rd Reuters)</p>
<p>(Paris) Prime Minister Laval and Sir Eden went to Geneva together at 8:30 last night to attend tomorrow's opening of the League of Nations Executive Council meeting. Before his departure, Laval met with the Italian Ambassador, Seruti, and informed Seruti of the results of his talks with Eden and Yugoslav Prime Minister Stojadinović. This morning, local newspapers reported that "Eden and Laval unanimously agreed to submit a joint report from the Three-Nation Conference to the League of Nations Executive Council, and stated that the two will propose the following agenda for the Executive Council: (1) Reading of the report by Laval and Eden; (2) Presentation by the Ethiopian representative; (3) Presentation by Italian representative, Sir Chen Laxi; (4) Debate.</p>
<p>The above procedure is because Ethiopia is the complainant country, so it should be heard first. Eden has agreed not to impose sanctions, but with reservations, that is, he can still support the sanctions motioned by the French representative. The Chen Bao newspaper said that Laval intends to create a new proposal to resolve this dispute, which takes into account the dignity of Italy and the League of Nations. Laval originally scheduled to depart today, but suddenly decided to go to Geneva early last night because he hoped to cooperate with Eden and jointly draft a report before the League of Nations Executive Council meeting.

<p>(London) The attention paid by all circles in the United Kingdom to tomorrow's meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council is rare. It is expected that the League of Nations will postpone making a decision on sanctions and will decide only when Italy takes aggressive action. The overall situation is not expected to develop rapidly at present. Conversations on the streets and in vehicles are all afraid that the United Kingdom may not be able to avoid being caught up in the whirlpool of war. The news of the increased fortifications in Malta has caused even more such worries. In recent days, all newspapers have been filled with letters regarding the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, and opinions are mostly conflicting. Former Under-Secretary of State for India, Sir Hao Baihao Wosi, wrote to The Times, saying that if the League of Nations cannot implement negative repression against countries that are determined to invade, then no country will trust the League of Nations or rely on it for security. The League of Nations will do everything for naught. Harding representative, on the other hand, replied that the original purpose of the League of Nations Covenant was to eliminate, not to incite, war. Sanctions are tantamount to raising an army, and it is feared that a spark will cause a major disaster, and Western civilization will be completely sacrificed. The Daily Guidance newspaper said that the real cause of the danger is that Britain and France have monopolized the rights and interests of the world's essential commodities and must now redistribute them. The League of Nations mandate system is an ideal solution. If Britain now declares its willingness to accept the principle of mandate in its entire colonial empire, it can satisfy Italy's disappointment and gather the world's international forces of justice to move towards the same goal.

<p>(Paris) The British delegation that went to Geneva tonight to attend the meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council visited the French Foreign Ministry to see the French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval. All the people's faces showed slight worry. The chief representative of the United Kingdom, Eden, detailed to Laval the attitude of the British government towards the Ethiopian Emperor's concession of oil rights to the American African Colonization Company, saying that the British government had no relationship with this concession of rights and did not give it support. Laval was very satisfied to hear this. According to all circles in the United Kingdom tonight, the mutual understanding between the United Kingdom and France is better than before. The concession of rights issue will not have any impact on the actual case of the dispute between Italy and Ethiopia. Eden and Laval will go to Geneva in the same car tonight, and will continue to discuss matters such as the League of Nations Executive Council meeting procedures and the submission of the Paris Three-Nation Conference report.

<p>(Rome) The British Ambassador to Italy, Drummond, formally declared to Foreign Affairs Minister Suvik that the British government had no prior knowledge of the Ethiopian government's concession of oil mining rights. However, responsible sources declared that the British government's repeated statements lacked sincerity, because the tone was ambiguous and did not address the core of the matter. The British statement only stated that the British government did not know about the concession of oil mining rights, but did not specifically state that this development was against the British government's intentions, so it must not be placed under the British government's protection. Italians have openly recognized that the British government has at least an indirect relationship with this matter. According to the opinion of responsible sources in Italy, this agreement must be cancelled because it is not a legal procedure. Italy cannot tolerate it under any circumstances. (2nd National Telegraph)</p>
<p>(Paris) British Minister Without Portfolio Eden told French Prime Minister Laval today that the British government had no prior knowledge of the vast oil rights obtained by Richard in Ethiopia, and said that Britain's interests in Ethiopia were only in the Lake Tsana region. Laval also told Britain that France's interests were only in the Djibouti railway. After Eden and Laval finished talking, they stated that Richard's actions could not change the London government's position on the East African crisis, and said that Richard's backing was purely American forces. According to the Djibouti correspondent of the Daily Mail newspaper, Richard himself also said that the assignee was an American company with a capital of 50 million US dollars. According to Richard, the main management of the American company will soon go to Ethiopia to start development work. (2nd National Telegraph)</p>

(2nd National Telegraph)</p>
<p>Djibouti Richard told Reuters reporters here today about the Ethiopian government's concession of oil mining rights to the African Colonization Company, saying that the company is entirely American-owned, and the content of the contract is no different from what has been announced, but the Ethiopian government has not been paid in cash. No money will be paid until the company starts operating. This is a common practice between the government and the assignee. He believes that the Ethiopian government is more concerned about domestic development projects such as road construction and improved education than purchasing arms. (3rd Reuters)</p>
<p>Aking The content of the contract for the concession of kerosene mining rights signed between the government and the African Colonization Bank is as follows: (1) The company shall supply the required amount of kerosene according to the needs of the Ethiopian government, and the price shall be based on the production cost and reasonable profit. (2) The company must export 2,500,000 tons of kerosene to Ethiopia every year, otherwise the Ethiopian government will demand compensation for the full amount. (3) Within four years after mining, the company shall obtain the consent of the foreign country concerned to set up an oil pipeline from the oil mine to the foreign port. If this cannot be done by then, the company shall immediately abandon the concession right, and the Ethiopian government shall recover it at market price. (4) The company may establish subsidiary companies, but shall apply to the official hall for registration under the nationality of the United States or Ethiopia. As for the staff required by the subsidiary companies, Ethiopian people should be employed first, but foreigners who comply with the Ethiopian immigration regulations may also be employed. (5) In the event of extraordinary events, such as internal unrest and foreign wars, which make it impossible for the company to carry out its business, the company may request that the concession right be extended proportionally. (6) All materials used for mining and operation shall be exempt from import duties and other donations to Ethiopia within 21 years from the date of commencement. (7) Within 21 years from the date of commencement, if other minerals are discovered, the company may request the Ethiopian government to mine them within 40 days after the discovery, and the conditions are the same as those stipulated in this contract. In addition, there are still clauses on financial issues in various provisions of this contract, which outsiders have not been able to know. (3rd Havas)</p>

<h3 id="e73">Dapeng Bay: The Pirate Queen Captured; Tan Jinjiao Rampaged at Sea for More Than a Decade; Participated in All Pirate Attacks on Shanghai Vessels <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Dapeng Bay (Bias Bay) in Huiyang County, Guangdong Province, has recently been a haven for pirates. For more than a decade, foreign ships and Shanghai ships that have been robbed include the Meixili, Xiudun, Andong, Xinhua, Taiyi, and Lushan Maru. Recently, after repeated searches and suppressions by the Guangdong authorities, the pirates have been gradually eliminated. However, among them, there is a female pirate named Tan Jinjiao, whose name has long been heard by both Chinese and foreigners. Westerners have even given her the nickname "Pirate Queen." Because she is a woman, Tan disguises herself and appears in Guangdong, Hong Kong, and Shanghai to deceive people. Therefore, male pirates have been successively eliminated, but Tan has still been able to remain at large. When Fang Tan Shi, the leader of the pirates in the bay, led his gang members Li Rong, Cai Shaojiu, Chen Fangzai, and others, seven or eight in total, to rob the Taiyi vessel, the female pirate Tan Jinjiao boarded the ship in Shanghai disguised as a Western woman. She privately transported bandit weapons and bought young girls, disemboweled them to hide weapons, and avoided inspection. Therefore, the pirates were able to obtain weapons in transit to carry out the robbery. After the Taiyi vessel was robbed, a squad leader escorting the vessel was also shot and killed. In 1930, the pirates Li Rong and others again plotted to rob a Shanghai vessel. The plan was discovered, and weapons were found hidden in shoes. A group of nine people were arrested, but due to lack of evidence, they were only sentenced to one year in prison in Shanghai and deported for ten years. At that time, Tan Jinjiao and her accomplice Cai Hanchen fortunately escaped. After the incident, they fled back to Hong Kong. As the Hong Kong government tightened its crackdown on pirates, Tan and Cai hid in Guangzhou. Between 1932 and 1933, they re-engaged in piracy. After Lin Zhenxiong, the garrison commander of Huizhou, offered a reward for their arrest, Tan Jinjiao moved to another place and temporarily escaped. Since her former husband, Xiao Nong (also a male pirate), was shot and killed by his accomplices due to unequal distribution of loot, Tan remarried a man surnamed Lu. Recently, due to a slight laxity in the patrol, Tan thought she could escape the law and returned to Huiyang, residing at No. 15, North Gate Street, Fucheng. Finally, Deng Xingmin, the police chief of the first district of the city, discovered her and secretly reported it to the Bias Bay Garrison of Aotou. The director of the garrison immediately dispatched detectives and a squad of soldiers to arrest her at the address on the morning of August 24th, together with the police chief and police officers of the district. Thus, the "Pirate Queen," who had rampaged at sea for more than a decade, surrendered. When she was arrested, Tan Jinjiao was still composed, wearing a white homespun jacket and blue cloth trousers, talking and laughing naturally. She was immediately escorted back to the garrison and then, on the 28th of the month, a police team was dispatched to escort her to the province for interrogation by the headquarters. It has been found that Tan is 31 years old, from Nanjiang Township, Huiyang County. (August 29th)</p>

<p>Beijing Correspondence: The Meng Zheng Hui still operates in Mongolian yurts, which is quite inconvenient. The first task in future undertakings is to build a new headquarters. The new headquarters was surveyed and determined by the second plenary session to be located 15 li northwest of Bailing Temple, on the sunny side of Naer Tai Mountain and north of the Bailing River. The terrain is strategically important, and the scenery is pleasant. Mongolia has many deserts and lacks trees, but the area has natural forests and the Naer Tai Mountain. The central government has allocated 40,000 yuan for the construction of the new headquarters. Building materials are currently being purchased and transported from the Tianjin-Beijing area. The construction cost is estimated to be 120,000 yuan. It is said that the central government plans to allocate the funds in installments. The Meng Zheng Hui has already completed more than 100 rooms, which will be temporarily used for office purposes. The Meng Zheng Hui plans to build a new Mongolian city in Naer Tai. The central area of the district is the political district, where the Meng Zheng Hui office is located. The western area is the cultural district, where the Mongolian Normal School, Experimental Elementary School, and Mongolian Cultural Center are established. The eastern area is the military district, where the Mongolian Security Team is stationed, and the Mongolian Security Training Team is established. The southern area is the commercial district, where the Mongolian Trade Cooperative, Credit Cooperative, and shops are established. The northern area is the industrial district, where the Production Cooperative and livestock farms are established. The two natural forests in the northwest and southeast are designated as two experimental new villages. The villages are directly under the Meng Zheng Hui. The villagers are the employees of the Meng Zheng Hui and their family members, or outsiders who have been approved by the Meng Zheng Hui. Each village plans to have one village chief and two deputy village chiefs, all of whom will be selected by the Meng Zheng Hui from among the villagers. It is said that the construction of the new villages will begin soon. (August 31st)</p>

<p>Fuzhou Correspondence: The southwest of Fujian Province has always been rich in mineral resources, such as coal, iron, zinc, and lead in Longyan, Zhangping, Anxi, and other counties, which are particularly well-known.

In the early summer of this year, the provincial government specially hired Japanese technicians and Councilor Xu Ruilin to explore mineral deposits in various counties in the southwest, and they also considered them to be excellent sources of wealth, with plans to develop them. However, due to the excessive capital requirements, the plan was abandoned.

<h3 id="e76">Wuxi: Widening of Zhenyingdao Lane Street <a href="#e76" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c76" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">76</a></h3>
<p>Zhenyingdao Lane in our county's city has a narrow and winding street, which is very inconvenient for vehicles to pass through and is prone to danger. Zhang Fulin, the director of the Construction Bureau, took this into consideration and advocated finding a way to widen the street and using more than 9,000 yuan in cash from the construction surplus for the year 1934. It was stipulated that the road surface would be 6 meters wide and would be straightened from the park library road. He once contacted Magistrate Wang, who expressed his approval, but said that a detailed plan was needed before a decision could be made. All houses in the area would be purchased to revitalize the market. Therefore, he specially convened the fifth meeting of the Construction Committee at 11:00 AM yesterday (3rd) to discuss the matter. After discussion, it was unanimously approved. It was also stipulated that the intermediate macadam road surface would be 2800 square meters, 4 meters wide, and 700 meters long. The two sides of the six-brick road surface would be 1400 square meters, 2 meters wide. The main ditch would be 510 meters long, there would be 68 branch ditches, 4 kilns, and 3 bridges would be repaired. The streets from the West Suspension Bridge to Dexin Bridge must also be widened to 6 meters. The soil base for Deyuan Road will be constructed in accordance with the approved plan. The insufficient funds will be borrowed from the construction funds for 1936.</p>
<h3 id="e77">Meat Industry Strike Unresolved <a href="#e77" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c77" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">77</a></h3>
<p>The city's meat industry strike has lasted for three days, reaching a stalemate. The day before yesterday, twenty-three businesses successively reported to the slaughter tax office for inspection to resume business. However, they were met with demonstrations from striking meat merchants, and consequently suspended their operations to avoid unexpected losses. Yesterday (the 3rd), no meat shops in the city were open for business. Butchers in the urban area have not tasted meat for three days. Some went to rural areas to buy meat, but prices in the market took the opportunity to rise. Mao Hezhang, the director of slaughter tax collection, telegraphed a report to the provincial government, the Department of Education, and the Education Funding Management Office, requesting instructions on handling the destruction of property and personal injury during the meat industry strike. He stated that the current collection of taxes based on the number of animals slaughtered was originally intended to rectify tax collection, in accordance with provincial regulations, levying 55 cents per animal. The meat merchants opposed this, but the tax office will not soften its stance. Other meat merchants want to report for inspection to resume business, but the authorities cannot provide reliable guarantees, so they dare not operate. The day before yesterday, the county government received Instruction No. 658 from the Yuan Su Education Funding Management Office, ordering it to instruct its subordinates to provide effective assistance. After receiving the order, County Magistrate Wang convened the Public Security Bureau yesterday to comply and issued a notice to all meat merchants to pay taxes in accordance with the regulations and not to resist, otherwise they would be investigated. Yesterday, the meat industry sent 1,200 yuan of unpaid taxes to the County Chamber of Commerce for safekeeping, pending mediation. The County Chamber of Commerce stated that it had received a letter from the Meat Industry Association, stating that on September 2nd, the slaughter tax office had suddenly ordered officials to sell slaughtered pigs at the meat stall of Pan Fuji on Jiaoji Road, causing great panic among the industry and pushing the meat industry to its death. They requested that the tax office be instructed to strictly adhere to the regulations. The Chamber of Commerce believed that the tax office, as its name suggests, should focus on tax collection. If, as the industry claimed, it engaged in slaughtering and selling itself, it would be monopolizing the meat industry, giving society grounds for criticism, and have nothing to do with tax collection. Yesterday, it sent another letter to the tax office, urging it to investigate whether anyone was fraudulently using the tax office's name for personal gain and to order them to stop immediately to prevent the situation from escalating. If the tax office ignored this and an accident occurred, the tax office would be held responsible. After receiving the advice letter from the Chamber of Commerce, the Meat Industry Association's attitude softened slightly. Xi Fan and others led more than 40 representatives from various sections to the county government and other departments to persuade them to resume business first. Therefore, starting today, if the tax office continues to sell meat itself and does not collect taxes based on the number of animals slaughtered, business may resume. However, whether the tax office will agree is still questionable.</p>

<p>Recently, the price of silver abroad has soared. Some merchants are privately smuggling silver out of the country to seek huge profits. The Ministry of Finance believes that the outflow of silver has a significant impact on finance and has strictly ordered a crackdown. However, recently in Shasha, a town under this county, some people from other provinces, including Shi Shaoyun, Yang Hexiao, Huang Chaofu, Huang Chaogui, Huang Chaodong, and Ni Shaoqing, were buying silver coins and silverware from local villagers. They were discovered by Zhang Yuchen, the detective chief of the County Public Security Bureau, who seized sixteen taels and two qian of silver and sent them to the County Bureau for interrogation. They confessed that the silver was purchased by an agency on Rue Pu Shi in the French Concession of Shanghai and then smuggled out of the country. The bureau, believing that the private sale of silver violated the ban, sent them to the County Court yesterday afternoon (the 21st) for investigation.</p>

<p>Due to the excessive backlog of salt in Huainan, merchants have too much capital tied up, and barrel prices cannot be paid. As a result, many salt fields have suspended production, and merchants and salt producers have suffered losses. After several meetings, it was decided to adjust the salt fields to provide relief. The subsidies for grass barrels for salt production in all fields in the Nantong area will be cancelled. Starting from September, the price of salt for both external and internal rivers will be reduced by six cents per dan (unit of weight).</p>

<h3 id="e83">Ningbo: American Missionary Herbert Hauberg Robbed by Bandits <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Herbert Hauberg, an American of the American Baptist Church, previously worked in Ningbo for many years and is currently working in Shanghai. His office is located at 169 Yuanmingyuan Road, Shanghai. The day before yesterday, he came to Ningbo with his daughter to visit his friend, American doctor Thomas, at the Meihua Hospital outside the North Gate. Hauberg and his daughter stayed at Thomas' residence in the hospital. Last night, Hauberg and his daughter had dinner at the residence of Mr. Pei, a Westerner at the Shengmu School in Xiancangmen. After dinner, they returned to their residence at 10:30 PM. While passing through Yongfeng Road on the Huan Cheng Road, four bandits suddenly appeared. One bandit pointed a pistol, warning them not to make a sound. The other bandits searched Hauberg, robbing him of three yuan in cash, a platinum watch chain, and a small gold knife. The street was deserted and it was close to midnight. After getting the loot, the bandits calmly escaped. After Hauberg and his daughter returned to their residence at the Meihua Hospital, they reported the robbery to their friend Thomas. The hospital telegraphed the Second Public Security Sub-bureau, which immediately dispatched police to search for the bandits. At around 12:00 AM, police officers Zhang Mingyu and others from the Second Sub-bureau captured three bandits, Lu Awen, Dai Ayang, and Yue Aken, near the San You intersection at No. 8, Xiushui Street, behind Zhongshan Park. A pistol, three bullets, and the stolen watch chain were found on Lu Awen. Suspect Tao Dehua was also arrested near Zhongshan Park and transferred to the Investigation Team for further investigation.</p>
<h3 id="e84">Letter from Jiang Zudai <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Respectfully, I read in your newspaper on August 25th and 30th about Jiang, the manager of the Bank of Communications Nanjing Branch, embezzling funds and engaging in corruption, and that Jiang's family members asked Gao Shuo, a counselor of the Supervisory Yuan, and Yang Tianxi, a commissioner, to bribe Sun Shaokang, the chief prosecutor of the Jiangning Local Court, to intercede. I found it unbelievable. Upon investigation, this spring, Ge Xinghua, the manager of the Xiaguan branch of the Bank of Communications, and others misappropriated bank funds, leading to implications and lawsuits. As the manager of the Nanjing branch, Zudai is undeniably responsible for the lack of supervision. However, since I am among those being sued, I can only wait for the court to handle the matter. Previously, the head office believed that Zudai was responsible for the lack of supervision and withdrew the civil lawsuit. The criminal responsibility is currently under appeal, and there will be a fair judgment. Since this case occurred, Zudai's family members have never asked anyone to intercede with the Jiangning Local Court Prosecutor's Office. The claims of bribery are baseless and unfounded. I am afraid that the outside world does not understand the truth and will be confused, so I specially request a correction. I respectfully ask for your fair judgment. Respectfully yours, Jiang Zudai, September 1st.</p>

<p>The 500,000 yuan emergency relief loan from the Provincial Water Disaster Relief Association, of which 300,000 yuan was underwritten by the Central, China, and Communications Banks, has completed the procedures and was signed and delivered yesterday. The remaining 200,000 yuan is expected to be fully available within two to three days. The association is scheduled to hold a regular meeting today to discuss and appoint provincial investigation and relief directors to depart for investigation and relief efforts. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Signing of Promissory Note: The Central, China, and Communications Banks have underwritten 300,000 yuan of the 500,000 yuan relief loan borrowed by the Water Disaster Relief Association from the banking sector. The procedures have been completed. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Lu Bohong, a representative of the Water Disaster Relief Association, brought the promissory note to the association.

<p>Delivery Yesterday: After the signing was completed, Lu Bohong personally took the promissory note to the Central Bank. After receiving the promissory note, the bank transferred all 200 million yuan of the loan and deposited it into the Water Disaster Relief Association account. Lu took the withdrawal certificate to the association and reported to Vice-Chairman Xu Shiying.</p>
<p>Original Text of the Promissory Note: Promissory note of the Shanghai All Circles Raising Funds for the Provincial Water Disaster Relief Association. As the fundraising for the relief takes time, and the disaster areas urgently need relief, the first joint meeting of directors and supervisors on August 10th resolved to publicly recommend Wu Tiecheng, Xu Shiying, Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Xiaolin, Chen Guangfu, Lu Bohong, Lin Kanghou, Zhao Jinqing, Wang Xiaolai, and Yu Zuoting as representatives of this association to negotiate with your esteemed bank to borrow 200,000 yuan in national currency for emergency relief. As soon as the donations are received, they will be repaid first, with interest calculated according to the usual practice. The chairman, vice-chairman, chairmen of each group, and the recommended representatives will be jointly responsible and sign the loan agreement. Now, we have borrowed 300,000 yuan in national currency from your esteemed Central, China, and Communications Banks. This promissory note is created for record.</p>
<p>Xu's Remarks: Xu Shiying and Lu Bohong told reporters from the Huadong News Agency yesterday that the aforementioned 300,000 yuan has been delivered today, and the remaining 200,000 yuan, the shortage is limited, and it will be delivered successively within two to three days.</p>

Whether he will visit the disaster situation in Jiangsu Province will depend on the disaster situation in Jiangsu Province.</p>
<p>Distribution of Relief Goods: Since the floods in the Yangtze River and the Yellow River, many have died, and recently, epidemics have become prevalent and spread rapidly. Yesterday, the Shanghai All Circles Raising Funds for the Provincial Water Disaster Relief Association specially distributed relief medicines to Hubei, Shandong, Henan, Hunan, and Jiangxi provinces, including 18,000 bottles of dysentery powder, 15,000 packets of headache powder, 14,500 packets of Bagua Dan, 13,500 large pots of universal oil, and 15,000 bottles of Shasha water to implement various relief measures. From this, it can be seen the severity of the epidemics in various places and the seriousness of the Water Disaster Relief Association's efforts to provide emergency relief. Furthermore, due to reports yesterday that an epidemic had broken out in the Xuzhou area, the association issued two large boxes of relief medicines to be transported by express train to Xuzhou for Commissioner Shao to distribute and provide relief.</p>
<p>Panchen's Donation: The association received a telegram from Dai Chuanchou, the president of the Examination Yuan, stating, "Mr. Xu Junren and Mr. Wang Yiting, Shanghai, esteemed sirs, the Panchen Lama is currently holding the Kalachakra Dharma assembly at the Tar Monastery in Xining to pray for the country and has remitted 5,000 yuan to be entrusted to the Relief Committee to provide relief to disaster victims. Please have the two gentlemen telegraph thanks, Dai Chuanshen kowtows, East." After receiving the telegram, the association, in addition to sending a telegram and publishing it in the newspaper to express their gratitude, telegraphed Commissioner Ge of the Beijing Relief Committee to withdraw the funds.</p>
<p>Hu's Donation of Medicine: Xu Shiying, the chairman of the relief committee, received a telegram yesterday from Hu Wenhu, a wealthy overseas Chinese, stating, "Chairman Xu Shiying, esteemed sir, I received a telegram forwarded from the Shanghai Branch yesterday, stating that this year's Yangtze River floods have been severe, and I have personally inspected the counties of Tianmen and Hanchuan in the upper reaches. Everywhere I have traveled, I have lamented the devastation. The disaster victims have been living in the water for a long time, and diseases are rampant. As the saying goes, 'After floods, there will inevitably be a major epidemic.' After contemplating this, I cannot sleep peacefully. I hope to send sufficient relief medicines to facilitate distribution and save lives. Respectfully, I have specially sent fourteen boxes of Universal Oil, totaling 40,320 packets, on the Slsmemnqm ship, to Mayor Wu Tiecheng for your esteemed office to receive and distribute to the disaster areas. I respectfully wish you peace and prosperity, Hu Wenhu bows."</p>
<p>Donations Received by This Newspaper Yesterday: Yesterday (the 3rd), this newspaper received donations for the provincial water disasters, totaling 100 yuan from Wang Jiatong, 80 yuan collected by Chen Peixing of HSBC (including 10 yuan each from Chen Peixing and an anonymous person, and 5 yuan from another anonymous person, 1 yuan each from Qian Weigen, Cai Kangtai, Shen Jiakui, Yao Yuangan, Cao Shengru, Cao Songchou, Yu Wenhui, and Luo Gongfu, 1 yuan each from He Shougeng, Chen Chunting, Chen Peijun, Lu Zan Chen, Xu Chengliang, Zhang Qixiang, Zhou Ruichang, Cao Jueshen, Lu Ganliu, Song Zenggui, Zhang Yusheng, Xin Yuanming, Xu Ruisheng, Jin Mingsun, Wang Guiting, Qin Bingsheng, Lu Maoqing, Gu Dihua, Sun Hesheng, Zou Shiqi, Gu Suihong, and Huang Zhenxi, 1 yuan each from Shi Liansheng, Zhou Junqing, Zhu Jin Jun, Qin Bingquan, Yu Jinlin, and Yu Dingqiao, 0.5 yuan each from Zhu Miaoyun, Wang Guanjue, Wu Xingcun, Zhang Shouzhang, Fang Rongfu, Jiang Liansheng, Yang Zhenwu, Chen Lianfu, Zhu Yande, Cheng Zixi, Cao Lanniu, Ni Ruilong, Sheng Nianci, Pan Xiangyun, Wu Shanqing, Xu Xianting, Shen Ziliang, Wang Baorong, Zheng Wenli, Liu Songsheng, Guo Min, and Cai Jian, 59 yuan from the Zheng Guanghe company (the original letter is attached below), 50 yuan from Zhang Dachuan, 9.7 yuan in silver dollars from Jin Tong Gong, 3.62 silver dollars, and 6,100 cash, 15 yuan from the Yu Xie family in Jiaochuan, 10 yuan each from Min Shuting and Xiong Ziying, 4 yuan from Fang Jianyun, 2 yuan from an anonymous person, 1 yuan each from Wang Biren, Mi Mei, Xu Caizhang, and Ye Baiji, and 0.2 silver dollars from Hu Xinquan. We received 344.9 silver dollars, 3.62 silver dollars, and 6,100 cash. We are now publishing the original letter from Zheng Guanghe below to promote kindness and encourage others. Respectfully, all of us, recognizing the severe water disasters in various places and the tragic situation of the disaster victims, are deceived by our conscience, and we have saved expenses for clothing, food, and entertainment, totaling 59 silver dollars, and we kindly ask you to forward it to the relief organization. Although the amount is very small and useless, if the more than a thousand foreign companies in Shanghai can imitate each other and work together, then accumulating sand into a tower may not be impossible to remedy one in ten thousand cases. Your newspaper is enthusiastic about disaster relief and leads all newspapers. We also ask you to make a sincere request to all foreign companies in Shanghai on behalf of the disaster victims, in order to achieve some results and benefit the disaster victims. The virtue of this is profound. We ask all the staff of the Shen Bao office to take note, Zheng Guanghe company.</p>

<h3 id="e88">Representative to Attend International Forestry and Other Conferences, Pi Zuo Returns Home Yesterday, Report on China's Forest Conditions Receives Favorable Reviews, China Wins Two Awards in International Rural Film Competition <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>According to the Shen Shi News Agency, this year is the centenary of Belgium's independence. The Belgian government specially invited government representatives from all over the world this year to hold the International Forestry Conference. China sent Pi Zuoqiong, a technician from the Ministry of Industry, to go abroad on June 7th of this year to participate. At the same time, he also represented China at the Fourth International Agricultural and Industrial Conference and the International Rural Film Competition. After Pi attended the above three conferences in Belgium, he also took a convenient trip to Germany, France, Belgium, and Italy to investigate the forestry management and sawmill equipment situation. The matter has been completed. Last month, he returned home on the Conti Rosso and arrived in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday. He is scheduled to go to Beijing to report and return to duty within days.</p>
<p>Proceedings of the Forestry Conference</p>
<p>According to Pi, he announced to reporters from the Shen Te News Agency yesterday that the International Forestry Conference was held in Brussels, Belgium, starting on July 25th. The chairman was Mr. Jinier, the president of the Forest and Water Conservancy University of Lirangsi, France. The conference was divided into four groups: the first group on all technical issues related to forests, the first group on all protection and management issues related to forests, the third group on all forest administration and legislative statistics issues, and the fourth group on all forest technology and gasoline substitute issues. There were dozens of proposals submitted by various countries, mostly concerning the operation, improvement, and scientific cultivation of forests. All proposals have been discussed and satisfactory results have been achieved, and there are many that can be used as a reference for improving China's forestry industry.</p>
<p>Agricultural and Industrial Conference</p>
<p>(2) The International Agricultural and Industrial Conference was held in Brussels, Belgium on July 19th. On the 16th, Belgium met with the chief representatives of various countries, with 49 countries participating and 900 representatives participating. The chairman was Bodoang, the senator of Belgium. The conference was divided into ten groups for discussion. A total of 45 papers and 40 proposals were submitted on agricultural and industrial issues, mostly discussing scientific technology and general production and consumption balance methods. After the meeting, the leaders of the Belgian industry hosted a visit to the Belgian industry, which was a good impression. (3) In the International Rural Education Film Competition, 20 countries registered, and 13 countries attended. China's "Farmer's Spring" film won the second international honor. The first place was Hungary, but later Italy requested that China, Hungary, and Italy be listed together on the honorary certificate, which was a great honor.</p>
<p>Report on China's Forests</p>
<p>China sent representatives to the International Forestry Conference this time, because the invitation was received too late and there was no time to prepare a proposal. Only a brief overview of China's forestry was drafted, which was greatly appreciated internationally. The report is divided into the following key points: (1) the establishment of China's forest policy, (2) the evolution of China's forest policy, and the status of China's forests and the types of wood needed in China since the establishment of the National Government, (3) China's recent afforestation achievements, (4) China's recent timber trade status. According to Pi, the relationship between China and forests, during the period of 1927, China's average annual timber import surplus was about 50 million yuan, 67 million yuan in 1933, and about 84 million yuan in 1934. According to the above statistics, the import surplus has increased by about eight times in the past three years. Therefore, the only remedy for China's forestry industry is to develop forests as soon as possible.</p>

<h3 id="e89">Tang Hai'an Yesterday Returned to Shanghai from Guangdong <a href="#e89" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c89" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">89</a></h3>
<p>According to reports, this trip was to discuss anti-smuggling issues and inspect the construction situation in Guangdong Province.</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Tang Hai'an, superintendent of the Jianghai Customs, was ordered by Finance Minister Kong last month to go to Guangdong to discuss anti-smuggling issues and inspect the construction situation in Guangdong Province. He returned to Shanghai yesterday afternoon at 3:30 pm aboard the Italian postal ship Conte Rosso. He will soon report everything to Finance Minister Kong. Mr. Tang met with reporters from various newspapers on the ship yesterday and gave a detailed account of his trip to Guangdong.</p>
<p>Preventing Smuggling</p>
<p>"I was ordered by Finance Minister Kong to go to Guangdong for two tasks: one was to discuss anti-smuggling issues, and the other was to inspect the progress of Guangdong Province's three-year construction plan. There is absolutely no political relationship involved. Two years ago, Guangdong Province's monthly national tax revenue was 2 to 3 million yuan, and the monthly provincial tax revenue was 6 to 8 million yuan. In recent years, the monthly national tax revenue has decreased to 1.25 million yuan, and the provincial tax revenue has decreased to 4.5 million yuan. The reason for the sharp decline in tax revenue is that the anti-smuggling plan is not yet perfect. In addition, the rivers in Guangdong Province are branching, resulting in more and more smugglers. Moreover, many smugglers rely on powerful forces, making it even more difficult to prevent. Finance Minister Kong, in view of this, specially sent me to Guangdong to visit Commander-in-Chief Chen Bonan and Chairman Lin Yunhai to discuss everything. The results were quite satisfactory. It has now been decided to designate anti-smuggling zones (Preventive Zone) in the border areas of Guangdong Province, such as Guangzhou Bay, and establish a general checkpoint at Humen. As for Shanwei and the border between Shenzhen and Kowloon, additional checkpoints will be established to prevent smuggling."</p>

<p>"Finance Minister Kong also believes that at a time when economic depression pervades the country, the Guangdong provincial authorities are still determined to carry out the three-year plan and engage in construction to alleviate the people's suffering. Therefore, he specially sent me to inspect the development of various construction projects. I visited many factories during this trip. Among them, the largest in scale and the most effective is the sugar factory. There are six sugar factories in total, each with a construction cost of 6 million yuan. Two of them have been completed, and the rest are in progress. They will all be completed in four months. There are 120,000 mu of sugarcane fields to supply these six sugar factories as raw materials. Two of them have already started to produce sugar. The quality is far superior to Taikoo sugar and comparable to Dutch Javanese sugar. When the six sugar factories are working together, the output next year will be 12 million yuan. In the past, China's sugar imports exceeded exports by 20 million yuan annually. In this way, one-tenth of the profit rights can be recovered. In addition, I also visited the three spinning factories (spinning, weaving, and silk weaving) and the steel, soda, sodium permanganate, and sulfuric acid factories. The impressions I gained were very good."</p>
<p>Written Report</p>
<p>Mr. Tang also said, "I will soon submit a written report to Minister Kong, and the central government will decide on subsidies based on the situation. The Guangdong side has no demands. The Guangdong side, both high and low, has a very good feeling towards the central government, and the future is very optimistic."</p>

<p>Central News Agency reports: Our country's newly appointed ambassador to Germany, Cheng Tianfang, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago to handle private affairs. He is staying at the Cangzhou Hotel. A reporter visited him at his hotel yesterday morning and inquired about his departure date, etc. According to him:</p>
<p>Taking Office Next Month</p>
<p>"According to Ambassador Cheng, after I was appointed as ambassador to Germany, I originally planned to start my journey immediately. However, because the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee was scheduled to be held, I decided to depart after attending the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Committee. The departure date is set for early October. The current Minister to Germany, Liu Chongjie, is still in Germany. He will return to the country after I arrive in Germany. This time I came to Shanghai to handle private affairs. I will stay for about a week and then return to Nanjing."</p>
<p>Promoting Friendly Relations</p>
<p>"The relationship between China and Germany has always been very friendly. In recent years, Germany has been working hard on national rejuvenation to restore its position in Europe. Therefore, it does not pay much attention to the events in the Far East. The cooperation between China and Germany in culture has been excellent. China's industry has received a lot of help from Germany. Therefore, after I take office, I will continue to work hard to make the relationship between the two countries even closer."</p>

<p>Ambassador Cheng continued to talk about diplomatic issues, saying, "My opinion on diplomacy is that friendship with all countries should be universal. We should be friendly with all countries that express sympathy for our country."</p>
<h3 id="e92">Stamp Tax Supervisors Entered Nanjing Yesterday, Will Visit Director of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance This Morning for Instructions, Committee Changed to Sixteen People Conducting Inspections in Eighteen Provinces <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Since the new Stamp Tax Law was implemented on September 1, the Ministry of Finance, in order to rectify national tax revenue and strictly supervise the handling of stamp tax collection in various provinces and cities, specially established a committee to conduct supervision. Now all the supervisory committee members have entered Nanjing last night to receive instructions, and then they will depart from Nanjing in different directions. The details have been obtained by the Dagong News Agency reporter and are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Director of the Tax Department Will Give Instructions This Morning</p>
<p>"The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, upon the order of the Ministry of Finance, established the Stamp Tax Supervisory Committee to rectify national tax revenue and supervise the provinces and cities to seriously handle stamp tax collection. Twenty-two people were selected as supervisors. After training by Director Wu Qiding, the work has been completed. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi placed great emphasis on the mission of increasing tax revenue for the supervisors. He had previously convened a training session in Shanghai and instructed the direction of the work. Stamp tax is one of the local taxes, and the new law has just been implemented. In order to give more detailed instructions, Gao Bingfang, Director of the Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, specially convened a training session in Nanjing this morning. Therefore, all the supervisory committee members prepared everything and took the 11:00 pm express train to Nanjing to receive instructions."</p>
<p>Assigned to Provinces and Departed in Different Directions</p>
<p>"The original quota for the Stamp Tax Supervisory Committee was 20 people. Now, due to the tense internal work of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, four people, including Li Chengshun, Li Da, Huang Huoda, and Lin Yuheng, were temporarily retained in the department to handle affairs. The remaining 16 people all went to the Ministry of Finance yesterday morning to receive instructions, and then left Nanjing in the afternoon to start supervisory work in different directions. The provinces and regions that each supervisory committee member is responsible for are: (Zhejiang) Cheng Jiyun, Shen Yue; (Shanxi) Li Ziwu; (Hunan) Liu Juhe; (Hebei) Liu Hongzhao; (Sichuan) Gu Xianzeng; (Fujian) Zhang Zhaofu; (Jiangsu) Li Guoqi; (Henan) Luo Chun'an; (Chahar, Suiyuan) Zhang Zhaomin; (Anhui) Qin Zhifu; (Jiangxi) Kong Qingzhi; (Hubei) Han Lide; (Yunnan, Guizhou) Liang Zaoming; (Shandong) Chen Mengfu; (Shaanxi, Gansu) Meng Zhijun. The duration of the supervision is not specified. After one province is inspected, the supervisory committee member will be replaced by the Taxation Department to supervise, in order to avoid malpractices."</p>
<p>Conscientiously Perform Supervisory Duties</p>
<p>"The Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance printed and distributed to the Stamp Tax Supervisory Committee the Notes on Conscientiously Performing Supervisory Duties: (1) Be familiar with the tax law. The supervisory committee members are concurrently staffed by personnel from the national tax authorities in various places, appointed by the Ministry of Finance. When necessary, additional personnel may be sent to handle the matter. Those who are acting as supervisors must be honest, capable, strict, and impartial. They must be familiar with and thoroughly understand the Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax, which were effective before the end of August 1935, and the Stamp Tax Law and the Implementing Regulations on Stamp Tax, which have been in effect since September 1, 1935, and related laws and regulations. This is to avoid undermining the prestige of the supervisory deployment. The situation of the stamp tax law is very complicated, and the difference of a hair can lead to a mistake of a thousand miles. If you do not study diligently at ordinary times, you will inevitably be unable to cope with events and make mistakes at every turn. Be careful! (2) Answer doubts. The previous Provisional Regulations on Stamp Tax were made in a hurry and were not complete. Therefore, over the years, there have been countless special cases in which departmental orders have supplemented the deficiencies in the regulations. Although the Stamp Tax Law, which came into effect on September 1, 1935, is more detailed and has detailed rules for implementation, various vouchers and books are numerous and have different names in different places. When the supervisory committee members perform their duties, in addition to the cases where the tax law has clear provisions and it is certain that the items should be stamped or exempted, they can answer them verbally at any time in accordance with the law. If they encounter items that are slightly suspicious, they must first report to the department for review and compliance. They must never arbitrarily explain to the outside world, so as to avoid disputes. (3) Fulfill duties. The duties that the supervisory committee should fulfill, those that have been clearly stipulated in the supervision of stamp tax, and those that the department instructs to handle at any time, should be strictly followed. At the same time, attention should be paid to the work of publicity and persuasion. Stamp tax is based on actual stamping as a principle. If you want to make the stamp tax revenue prosperous, you must implement actual stamping. In order to achieve the purpose of actual stamping, in addition to conscientiously performing supervisory duties, publicity and persuasion are especially important for the supervisory committee members. The main points of propaganda and persuasion are: (a) For merchants, clarify the original intention of the Ministry of Finance to reform the stamp tax system in November of last year, which was to eliminate the accumulated abuses of levies and allocations, and to allocate the collected taxes to supplement the localities to offset the need to abolish various local exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes, so that merchants can understand that once the local illegal exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous taxes are abolished, they will not only reduce the burden but also avoid disturbances. However, for the reasonable stamp tax, they should purchase and affix it in accordance with the law to avoid being discovered and punished, and taking the blame. Wherever the supervisory committee members go, if the local merchants do not pay much attention to the actual stamping of stamps, they may wish to consult with the local chamber of commerce to convene merchants from all industries, and immediately persuade them to understand the above-mentioned propaganda intentions, so as to develop the habit of actual stamping. (b) For the municipal and county governments, in addition to detailing the propaganda intentions of the first point, they can also state that the stamp tax revenue is closely related to the allocation of local funds. It is hoped that they will strictly order inspectors to conscientiously implement the inspection of stamp tax rules issued by the department at any time, so that the tax revenue will improve day by day, and both the central and local governments will benefit from it. (c) For local inspectors, in addition to thoroughly explaining the propaganda points of the first point, they should also be told that the inspection duties are handled by the locality, but the items that should be stamped are very complicated, and it is inevitable that merchants will take advantage of loopholes and omissions. The inspection items are especially important. It depends on the relevant responsible inspection personnel to conscientiously implement the stamp tax inspection rules issued by the department at any time. The surplus or deficit of tax revenue depends entirely on whether the inspection is virtuous. The department will also use this to observe the diligence of the staff, and must not treat the inspection as a concurrent matter, which is not important, and treat it as a formality, perfunctory, and shirk responsibility, which hinders tax revenue. If any inspection or sampling personnel in various places have any acts of favoritism, connivance, sheltering, or fraud, the supervisory committee members should report to the department at any time and report the facts for strict investigation, so as to be dealt with. The duties that the supervisory committee should fulfill should be limited to the above-mentioned scope, and must never interfere in matters outside the scope of duty. For example, if merchants have any complaints about stamp tax affairs, the supervisory committee members must not accept them and should order them to submit them to the department for verification. (4) Abide by the training rules. When the supervisory committee members go to various places to perform their duties, they should abide by the following training rules: (1) Handle affairs fairly and impartially; (2) Be peaceful in attitude and do not act rashly; (3) Be diligent in work and do not neglect or procrastinate; (4) Be careful and honest in conduct and do not cause criticism; (5) Be meticulous in dealing with matters and do not provoke disputes."</p>
<h3 id="e93">Haiyi to Open to Haiphong, Applied for International Ship License, the Navigation Administration Bureau Has Agreed to Issue in Advance for the Negotiation of Chinese Merchant Ye Chuanfang <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>The Haiyi ship, the agent of China Merchants Bureau for Chinese shipping companies, will sail to Haiphong. This is the first ship of Shanghai Chinese shipping to sail on a regular overseas route. Therefore, after negotiation between Xingnan and Yian, the management method was decided. It was originally planned to open the first shift tomorrow, but the Navigation Administration Bureau refused to issue the passenger license for this international shipping on the same day. It was necessary to send a surveyor to the ship for detailed inspection, so as to avoid the recurrence of the Xin Maoli ship. Therefore, China Merchants Bureau was notified that the passenger license of the Haiyi ship could not be signed and issued five days in advance. According to this notice, China Merchants Bureau changed the Haiyi ship to the Qingdao shift. As noted in yesterday's newspaper, this notice was learned by Ye Chuanfang, the owner of the Chinese merchant, that the hull of the Haiyi ship was extremely strong, and all parts were suitable for sailing abroad. This time, the first shift to Haiphong had been agreed upon, and telegrams had been sent to Haiphong to inform the passengers and shippers abroad, which were related to the schedule and credit. In any case, it must be opened and cannot be postponed. Mr. Ye went to the Navigation Administration Bureau to petition and request that the ship schedule and the first use of credit to the international community should be taken into account, and the passenger license should be filled out and issued. The Navigation Administration Bureau agreed to this negotiation and approved the advance signing and sealing, allowing it to depart for Haiphong on Friday.</p>
<h3 id="e94">First Phase of Literacy Schools in This City Concluded, Second Phase of Two Hundred and Twenty Schools Scheduled to Open on the 5th of This Month <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The first phase of literacy schools established by the Shanghai Municipal Government, a total of 218 schools, with approximately 55,300 students, opened on July 1 and ended at the end of August. On September 1, the Municipal Government ordered its subordinate bureaus to jointly send 218 examiners to various schools in various districts for examinations. The examination time was conducted in classes at the daily class time of each school. It is reported that the testing method was to select 200 commonly used words from the readings in this book, which were not very simple in form, and print a form, divided into two types for children and adults. The Shanghai Municipal Literacy Education Committee distributed them to various schools, filled in the student's name, and distributed them by name at the beginning of the examination time, limited to 15 minutes, and ordered the students to circle the words they did not know. The examiners then asked the students about the words that were not circled, marked and recorded the words that were known and not known, and then added the number of words circled by the student, and the examiners added their name stamps to the academic achievement certificates issued to those who passed the total score. It is reported that the examiners ran around various schools that day and were very busy. Some arrived at the schools one day in advance because of the distance, and some did not complete the testing until late at night. Now, the examination rosters and test papers have been taken back by the examiners and will be sorted and sent to the bureau directors within three days for compilation of reports to the Municipal Government. It is reported that the performance of most students is not bad. The examiners who were sent were also very serious during the testing. For the second phase of literacy schools, there are a total of 220 schools. The number of schools in each district has been assigned, and the Literacy Education Committee has notified the districts to find school buildings. The schools will open on the 5th of this month. After that, each phase will proceed in an orderly manner, and the illiteracy in this city will gradually be eliminated.</p>

<h3 id="e96">The French Concession Public Works Bureau Increased Housing Donations, Yesterday Four Representatives Were Sent to Du Yuesheng to Petition, Requesting That the Taxpayers' Association Negotiate with This Authority Again <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the residents of Jin Shenfu Road and La Yaode Road in the French Concession opposed the French Concession Public Works Bureau's increase in housing donations by two to five times in July of this year. Therefore, on the 28th of last month, they jointly sent a letter to Mr. Du Yuesheng, chairman of the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession, requesting justice and negotiating with reason. It has been negotiated with the authorities by Chinese Director Zhang Jixian. As a result, the two households of Wang Liandi at No. 101 Lane 1 and Wang Jinfu at No. 15 on the road were exempted from the increase because they did not install electric lights and running water. The rest were collected according to the increased amount. This caused dissatisfaction among the residents and demanded that the French authorities withdraw their order. Therefore, at 3:00 pm yesterday, four representatives, including Wang Shaochang and Wang Wenyuan, were sent to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the French Concession to petition. Shao Bingyuan, secretary of the association, received them. The representatives stated the petition and requested that the Taxpayers' Association negotiate with the French authorities again to cancel the increased donation and withdraw the order. As a result, Secretary Shao promised to forward it to Chairman Du and Chairman Zhang Jixian for continued negotiation and further handling. The representatives were satisfied and returned.</p>

<h3 id="e98">The Chamber of Commerce Presented to the Ministry of Industry Requesting the Establishment of a National Artificial Silk Factory <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce presented to the Ministry of Industry yesterday regarding the establishment of a national artificial silk factory, stating, "Presenting a proposal to establish a national artificial silk factory to stem the leakage, we respectfully request your approval and implementation. On the 2nd of this month, according to a letter from the Shanghai Silk Industry Guild, a member of the affiliated guild, stating that at the sixth session of the members' representative conference of the affiliated guild, Chairman Luo Qinghua proposed to petition the government to establish a national artificial silk factory, etc., and attached a preliminary proposal for the establishment of an artificial silk factory. According to this, artificial silk from foreign countries is a strong rival to our country's silk. In recent years, the import volume of artificial silk and fabrics has increased sharply every year. Domestic silk fabrics have been forced to stand almost nowhere. Although the government has raised the import tax on artificial silk, its import volume has not decreased because of this. Artificial silk uses plant fiber as raw material, and the cost is far lower than that of silk fabrics. Moreover, it is more colorful, so silk spinning factories and customers are almost happy to purchase it. Therefore, foreign artificial silk has become the main raw material of our country's silk spinning industry. If we do not find a way to remedy it, how can we stop the leakage? The industry guild advocates that the government promote it from above, and the merchants work hard from below, and the establishment of a national artificial silk factory is the key to saving our country's silk weaving industry. It is appropriate to present it to your ministry for review and approval, and order it to be followed, which is a public convenience."</p>

<p>The Ministry of Communications instructed the Shanghai Maritime Bureau: It has been found that transportation agencies are responsible for carrying mail, and that no individual may engage in the business of delivering mail.

<h3 id="e105">Li Quanshi Discusses: The Impact of Check Stamp Duty <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Dr. Li Quanshi, chief writer for the Banking Weekly, spoke to a reporter yesterday about the impact of check stamp duty. He said: Check stamp duty is sufficient to hinder the circulation of negotiable instruments, reduce capital turnover, and promote the power of foreign banks. All of these reasons have been detailed in the Shanghai Banking Association's submission to the Ministry of Finance, so there is no need to repeat them. I will now briefly state my views on other aspects of the impact of check stamp duty as follows: First, from the perspective of tax revenue, the total number of negotiable instruments exchanged by the Shanghai banking industry last year was 1,627,784. Assuming that they are all checks, and not including bills of exchange, then the revenue from a two-cent stamp duty per check would only be 32,555.68 yuan. Assuming that the number of checks not processed through the clearinghouse is the same, then this would only add another 32,555.68 yuan in revenue. Furthermore, assuming that the number of negotiable instruments from the Money Guild is twice that of the clearinghouse, then this would only add another 65,111.36 yuan in tax revenue. (According to statistics, the monthly number of negotiable instruments exchanged by the banking industry is approximately between 200 million and 400 million yuan, while the number of receipts and disbursements of the Money Guild is approximately between 1 billion and 2.3 billion yuan. Therefore, the number of negotiable instruments from the Money Guild is naturally greater than that of the banking industry. Let us assume that it is twice as much.) Furthermore, assuming that the number of checks from foreign banks is equal to that of all Chinese banks combined, then this would only increase the tax revenue by another 65,111.36 yuan. Furthermore, assuming that the circulation of checks in Shanghai is half of that of the entire China, then the revenue from check stamp duty in other ports and cities in China would only increase by another 195,334.08 yuan. Therefore, the total annual revenue from check stamp duty seems unlikely to exceed 390,668.16 yuan. It seems unwise to risk credit contraction and capital stagnation for the sake of 390,000 yuan in tax revenue. Second, please consider the national economy: a two-cent stamp duty is required for each check, so small-value checks will inevitably be eliminated. The people's need to use cash will inevitably increase. This will not only lead to an increase in the issuance of banknotes and a corresponding increase in reserve funds, but also an increase in the risk of daily losses from fire, theft, etc. This is undoubtedly a loss to the daily economy of the people. Is it accidental that the United States and other countries do not levy check stamp duty? Some may say that the elimination of small-value checks will inevitably increase the number of demand deposit accounts in the financial industry, which is beneficial. However, the deposit and withdrawal procedures for these increased demand deposit accounts will inevitably be more frequent than in the past. It is difficult to determine whether this is beneficial. Others may say that as the number of depositors increases, the deposit amount will also increase. As the deposit amount increases, the amount of government bonds and other collateral deposited with the Central Bank also increases, which will boost the price of government bonds and have a positive impact on national credit. However, it is uncertain whether this assumed benefit will be realized.</p>

<p>The Shanghai community's Flood Relief Amusement Fair has been open for two weeks. The grand occasion in the past has been repeatedly reported in the newspapers. As the closing is imminent, the committee has been attracting high-quality performances in recent days to boost ticket sales and raise more relief funds. For example, the Huizhou fireworks and the flood relief fireworks made by expert Li Junwen are screened every night, and viewers have praised them. The recent situation of the fair is described below.</p>
<p>Winners to Be Announced Tomorrow</p>
<p>The flower contest launched by the fair has seen enthusiastic participation from voters. In addition to performing at the fair on a daily basis, the famous beauties of the Beili district have also made great efforts to promote ticket sales. The committee has scheduled the flower contest winners to be announced publicly at the Jifang Building on the second floor of the West Building tomorrow night. All members of the flower community will be invited to attend and witness the event to show its importance. In recent days, those with hopes of winning have been campaigning vigorously. It is expected that the number of flower contest votes will be over 10,000. As for the dance contest, preliminary rounds will be held in turn at various dance halls, followed by a final round at the Paramount Ballroom. It is reported that the date and location of the preliminary rounds have also been scheduled. The first round will be held at the Saint Anna Dance Hall, starting tomorrow night.</p>
<p>Recent Performance Situation</p>
<p>The committee has dispatched personnel to purchase water lanterns and floats, which are known for their fame, to attract visitors. They will be transported to the fair for display soon. The film stars' stage performances are being prepared separately by the film companies. The Lianhua Film Company has appointed Li Lili, Wang Cilong, Han Langen, and Shang Guanwu as preparation committee members to actively prepare. The date of their appearance will also be within two or three days. The gathering of stars at that time will surely be a grand occasion.</p>

<h3 id="e108">The Case Against Da Zhonghua Factory: Hearing Concludes; Sentencing Scheduled for Next Tuesday <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council's Police Department, after investigating the fire that occurred at the Da Zhonghua Celluloid Factory on the evening of June 28, found that it originated in the factory's warehouse for storing celluloid sheets, causing the fire to spread to nearby Yongqing Lane, killing more than twenty people and injuring more than fifty. Therefore, Lawyer Ru Baoyi of the Legal Group of the Bureau cited the agreement on the recovery of judicial rights and petitioned the First Special District District Court to allow the participation of the Bureau in the lawsuit filed by the families of the deceased, including Wu Shaowen, against the factory's responsible persons for the crime of endangering public safety, and to provide relevant evidence for consideration. The court summoned all witnesses for investigation and inquiry, which has been reported in the previous newspapers. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui held a continued hearing. The defendants, Zhu Rutang, Chairman of Da Zhonghua Factory; Sun Hongcheng, General Manager; Jiang Junyan, Manager; and Ge Tianming, Qian Menglin (also known as Qian Zhenhua), the factory director, all surrendered to the court. The court first asked Zhu, Sun, and Ge about the reasons for their previous failure to appear in court. Zhu claimed illness, Sun claimed that he was mourning the death of his grandmother, and Ge claimed that he rushed home due to his child's illness and caught a cold in the heat, resulting in illness as well. Then, the court inquired in detail about the factory's building structure, the storage of goods inside the factory, and the condition of the fire. Ge Tianmin, the current factory director, is responsible for managing all factory affairs. The court repeatedly questioned him. According to Ge, the storage rooms in the factory for celluloid sheets usually stored 40,000 to 50,000 pounds of sheets, and sometimes 70,000 to 80,000 pounds. The court pointed out that, according to the police investigation, the fire started in the warehouse for storing sheets and spread to Yongqing Lane, and that since the sheets were flammable, why didn't the factory pay attention to reducing the amount stored? Ge denied that the fire started in the warehouse, saying that the fire originated in the seventh alley of Yongqing Lane and spread to the factory. As for the storage amount of celluloid sheets, Ge said that the authorities have never shown him any standards. The court then concluded that the facts were generally clear and ordered the start of the debate. The lawyer representing the plaintiffs, Wu Shaowen and others, then spoke, saying that the plaintiff's case was divided into two parts. The incidental civil suit has been settled out of court and requested to be withdrawn. As for the criminal suit, no investigation has been conducted from beginning to end, making it difficult to present evidence. The lawyer requested a discretionary judgment. The defense lawyer then responded, refuting the testimonies of the fire brigade officials, factory inspection officials, and Municipal Council engineers who appeared in court previously. After the defense, the court adjourned the hearing and scheduled sentencing for next Tuesday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e109">Dispute Over Confiscation of Taixing Local Wine: Production Area Implements Suspension of Business and Brewing; Wine Merchants Petition the Tax Administration <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The total annual sales of Taixing local wine produced in northern Jiangsu Province reach over 1.6 million [currency unit], which is the only business for the local spirit industry in Shanghai. Recently, a batch of Shenghua local spirit transported from Taixing to Shanghai was detained by the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau, leading to a dispute. Taixing wine merchants, unable to achieve results through negotiations, have all suspended business. Brewers, unable to promote sales, have also suspended brewing. The situation is escalating. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Sending Telegrams to the Government and Yuan to Urgently Stop</p>
<p>The Taixing Wine Industry Association believes that since Taixing wine merchants have already suspended business, the impact is not only on the loss of national tax revenue and the bankruptcy of wine merchants, but also on the livelihoods of tens of thousands of people in the entire county who directly or indirectly depend on brewing. A serious problem will inevitably arise. Yesterday, the association sent telegrams to various government agencies requesting an emergency stop. The original telegram is as follows: "Taixing Lianhui merchant Yin Dianyuan's 53 pieces of Shenghua local spirit, on which taxes were paid in accordance with regulations, were detained on August 3 by the Shanghai Inspection Office of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Unified Tax Bureau without reason. Merchants who have not violated the current national laws should not be subject to detention. Government agencies should be responsible under civil law for actions taken against the people. Director Jin of the Shanghai Inspection Office is harming the country and merchants by abusing his power and illegally detaining goods. The goods have been detained for a month and have not been released. Merchants regard Shanghai as a dangerous place and are forced to incite the public anger of all wine customers, who have voluntarily suspended business. In the future, the entire Taixing county's direct and indirect losses should be borne by the director. In addition to sending telegrams to the Central Party Headquarters, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Legislative Yuan, the Control Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, and the Tax Administration, we hereby send a telegram to your Excellency requesting an emergency order to stop Director Jin's illegal detention of goods and to return the goods quickly to uphold national law and alleviate the merchants' difficulties. We anxiously await your orders. Presented by Li Guoliang, Chairman of the Taixing County Wine Industry Association."</p>
<p>Taixing Wine Merchants Petitioned Yesterday</p>
<p>Taixing wine merchant Yin Dianyuan's wine boat has been detained for a month, causing significant direct and indirect losses. Yesterday, he personally went to Shanghai from Taixing and, together with representatives of the Taixing Wine Industry Association in Shanghai, petitioned the Tax Administration of the Ministry of Finance and personally submitted a petition, detailing the facts of the director's illegal detention of goods and requesting a correction. It is understood that all Taixing wine merchants and brewers will also come to Shanghai to petition and appeal if necessary.</p>

<p>Since the National Government's Aviation Highway Construction Lottery changed its new method, the number of tickets has decreased, the prize amounts have increased, and winning prizes has become easier than before. After the thirteenth drawing, many people in Shanghai and other places won small and large prizes. For example, the first prize was sold by the Dawun Company branch in Shanghai. The prize money has been fully paid by the China Communications Bank and other two banks. For a time, street gossip was full of stories of someone winning a big prize and someone else winning a big prize. Facts speak louder than words, so the lottery's credibility has become particularly strong, and sales have flourished accordingly. It is reported that the fourteenth lottery tickets have been purchased with great enthusiasm. The drawing is scheduled for the 6th of this month, and there are still two days left. The various sales outlets are almost sold out. On the day of the drawing, there will be no tickets to buy, so purchasers should act quickly.</p>

<p>The Taikoo Company's New Beijing ship departed from Shanghai for Ningbo at 5 PM on the 30th of last month. Upon leaving Wusong Port, the ship's radio suddenly received a report from the international radio station that a young woman, He Qi, was on board the ship attempting suicide and requested attention. The ship's owner immediately instructed the steward to inquire in detail in each cabin. It turned out that a young woman traveling alone was found in cabin number 17. Her demeanor was quite melancholic. The steward in charge of the cabin, Wang Ayuan, asked if she was He Qi and placed her under supervision. The next day, she was escorted back to Shanghai and taken away by her family. It is reported that the young woman is only twenty-six years old and is from Yuyao. Her family members are all in Shanghai doing business. She was scolded by her husband for a minor matter and attempted suicide out of anger.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Woman Quarrels with Husband: Jumps off Building in Anger and Commits Suicide <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>Wang Weide, Chinese Constable No. 2349 of the Huishan Police Department, and his wife, Chen Jinfeng, from Changzhou, 32 years old, lived together in Room 407 on the fourth floor of the Chinese Constable Apartment at No. 230 Baoding Road. At the end of last month, Chen Jinfeng suddenly left without saying goodbye. Wang and others searched for her everywhere, but her whereabouts were unknown. It was not until the afternoon of the following day that she returned on her own. When Wang asked where she had gone, she claimed that she had returned to her hometown to visit relatives, leading to an argument between the two. As a result of this frustration, the woman suddenly had suicidal thoughts and intended to jump off the building at her residence. Wang and others caught sight of her and held her back, preventing her from succeeding. However, at around 9 AM the day before yesterday, the woman had suicidal thoughts again. While her husband was washing his face in the bathroom, she jumped off the fourth floor, committing suicide for the second time. She was seriously injured and was rushed to the hospital in an ambulance after being discovered by a patrol constable. However, the rescue was ineffective, and she soon died. After an investigation by Shen Binkui, a detective from the Huishan Police Department, the body was transported to the Feilun Road mortuary. Yesterday morning, Prosecutor Guo Wei of the First Special District Court, accompanied by forensic doctor Wei and clerk Wang Zuyi, went to the mortuary to examine the body. According to Wang Weide, the deceased's husband, the examiner concluded that Chen Jinfeng, female, died from injuries sustained in a fall and handed the body over to her husband, Wang Weide, for burial.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Dong Cunbing, Owner of Shengda Paint Store, Accused of Fraud: Zhou Fengxiu Deposits 3,000 Yuan; Only 1,000 Yuan Withdrawn, Remaining Balance Missing <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Zhou Fengxiu, a woman from Zhejiang Shangchu residing at No. 38 Longqing Lane, Xihua Road, Public Concession, recently hired a lawyer to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing Dong Cunbing, a Shaoxing native and owner of Shengda Paint Store at No. 10 Deshun Lane, West Xinqiao Street, of fraud, requesting legal investigation and prosecution, and attaching a civil suit to recover 2,000 yuan in deposits. The court accepted the complaint and, on the morning of the [date], summoned the plaintiff and her lawyer, as well as the defendant and his lawyers, Xu Wufang and Zhang Shouchun, to appear in court. According to the plaintiff, Zhou Fengxiu, she deposited cash into the defendant's store account, under the name of Xiu Ji, over a period of time, totaling more than 3,000 yuan, through the introduction of Shi Wenrong. In March of this year, due to the need for money, she entrusted Shi to withdraw the money. Only 1,000 yuan was withdrawn. The defendant said that the remaining balance could only be paid after the Dragon Boat Festival collection. However, only a 500 yuan check was paid on time, which could not be cashed. The defendant once told Shi Wenrong that his store was about to be liquidated and that, as friends, he would temporarily use paint as collateral for the Xiu Ji deposit, and return it after it was sold. She mistakenly believed this and accepted the goods. However, the defendant later made excuses and did not take responsibility for the sale. It was also found that the quality of the paint was poor and did not match the market price. The defendant's actions clearly constitute fraud. She, as a woman, could not sell these goods. She requested an investigation and the recovery of the deposit. Witness Shi Wenrong testified in court, which was the same as the plaintiff said. The defendant, Dong Cunbing, denied fraud and said that he never told Shi that his store was to be liquidated or that he was responsible for selling goods as collateral for the deposit. In fact, Shi came to withdraw the deposit and, because he had no money to pay, Shi chose the goods himself to offset the debt based on the wholesale price. As for the 500 yuan check, it was not issued by him but transferred from elsewhere. At this point, the court considered the facts to be clear and ordered the lawyers of both parties to debate before declaring the hearing closed and scheduling sentencing for the morning of the 10th.</p>
<h3 id="e115">Ye Zhongfang Accused of Assaulting Officer Ding: Continued Hearing; Ye Transferred to Criminal Division, Actions No Longer as Free as Before <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Ye Zhongfang, from Ningbo, nicknamed "Little Jitterbug," was previously sued for divorce by his wife, Lu Yinglan, who sought 60,000 yuan in alimony. After the [date] hearing, the Second Special Court enforced the judgment according to law. Ye consistently refused to appear in court, so he was detained and forcibly executed. It has been more than two months now. He has been interrogated by the enforcement court many times. Because Ye's assets have been exhausted and he cannot pay, he remains detained. However, Ye still did not change his jitterbug nature in the detention center. At around 7 AM on the 30th of last month, he had a dispute with officer Shi Zemin when the latter was serving rice porridge because he thought the yellow soybeans in the porridge were too [unclear word]. Ye immediately attacked Shi, injuring him. Shi reported to the warden, who sent Ye to the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court for investigation. He was ordered to be detained pending further investigation. This has been reported in the newspapers. At 10 AM yesterday, Prosecutor Wang Ren held a hearing, summoning Ye Zhongfang, as well as Guo Rongji, a prisoner detained with Ye in the civil detention center, and Chen Lianzhong, a guard in the detention center, to appear for investigation. According to guard Chen Lianzhong, he saw the defendant Ye Zhongfang assault officer Shi Zemin. Guo Rongji said that although he saw Ye arguing with the officer, he did not see Ye assault him. When asked, Ye Zhongfang still denied the assault. Ye's lawyer, Ma Nangeng, said that the defendant Ye Zhongfang had been suffering from fever and chills for six days and had no strength to assault anyone, and there was no act of violence or coercion. Witness Guo Rongji also testified that there was no assault. He requested the court to investigate clearly. Prosecutor Wang reviewed the testimonies and ordered Ye to be returned to custody pending review. It is said that Ye used to be detained in the civil detention center. Although he was in the detention center, he could still move freely, either outdoors or writing drafts. Now, after this incident, he has been transferred to the criminal division of the detention center and is no longer free. Ye requested the prosecutor in court to have his detention room changed because the detention center was humid and stuffy. The prosecutor said that he should request this from the warden. He was then taken down by the bailiff and returned to custody. Also, Ye's concubine, Lu Xiaomei, used to visit him every morning, bringing him food and snacks. Now that Ye has been transferred to the detention center, Lu can no longer visit him every day. Yesterday, Lu went to the detention center to request a visit. The staff told her that, according to regulations, she could only visit once every other day. Lu left disappointed.</p>

<p>The China National Products Manufacturers Association believes that China is a vast country with a large population. Due to inconvenient transportation and other reasons, remote provinces and regions are often unable to transport and sell Shanghai goods in large quantities, making it impossible for local people to promote them. In view of this, the association, after receiving requests from member factories, decided at a regular meeting to hold the Sichuan Province Chengdu National Goods Exhibition. In addition to obtaining the consent of local party and government agencies, it has also been filed with the Central Party Headquarters and the Ministry of Industry. It has been scheduled to open in Chengdu on Double Tenth Day and last for three weeks to a month. The registration office is located in the association. After the registration is completed, it will be sent to Sichuan for layout to ensure the opening on time.</p>

<p>The National Goods World Exhibition on Nanjing Road, since its opening on the fifth of last month, has seen fairly good business. The exhibition was originally scheduled to last for one month, ending today, which marks the completion of the one-month term.

All factories have been notified yesterday that a small electricity fee will be charged for the extended period.</p>

<h3 id="e127">Sun Kejin Receives Medical Doctorate in Germany <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Sun Kejin has practiced medicine in Shanghai for eight years, serving as a medical officer and consultant for the Shanghai Headquarters, Police Department, Public Security Bureau, Anti-Narcotics Bureau, and China Merchants Steam Navigation Company. He specializes in skin and venereal diseases. His superior learning and rich experience have been praised by society. He currently serves as a medical officer at the Shanghai Security Command and a physician at the Central Sports Stadium. To study the world's new medical techniques, he took a leave of absence last year and went abroad. First, he studied dermatology and urology at the Vienna National University Hospital, the birthplace of European medicine, and also studied various latest medical techniques, such as radium treatment for cancer, light therapy for skin and venereal diseases, hot and cold cauterization, diathermy, and the removal of all facial spots, scars, warts, moles, and tumors. He also learned about dark-field microscopy to examine living syphilis spirochetes and urethroscopy to treat chronic, stubborn, and difficult-to-cure gonorrhea. People in Shanghai know that this disease is difficult to cure, but it is not the case in Europe. Gonococci can penetrate deep into Littre's glands, and washing, injecting, and diathermy cannot achieve the purpose. With this scope, the affected area is first observed, and then electricity is used to cauterize it, and all are eliminated, making it permanently non-recurring. He completed his studies this spring, obtained a certificate, and then went to Hamburg University in Germany to practice at the Department of Dermatology and Urology, serving as a physician in the department. He authored a specialized paper entitled "The Cause of Simultaneous Appearance of Two Skin Rashes." In the paper, he published various important causes and treatments, which were highly praised by experts in that country. The university professors considered it to be of great value and immediately published it in a medical journal. The German Ministry of Education awarded him a superior doctoral degree, which is truly commendable. It is heard that Sun will return to China this winter, bringing with him various modern therapeutic devices. He will soon go to countries such as England and France for on-site inspections. In the future, when he returns to Shanghai, he will definitely make many contributions to the medical field and be a boon to patients.</p>

<p>Ji Agen, a native of Jiangbei, was shot and killed on Gonghe Xin Road in Zhabei in the autumn of 1933. At the time, his wife, Ji Wang, reported the case to the District Court Procuratorate, which sent personnel to investigate and awaited the arrest of the murderer. Recently, Ji's wife, Ji Wang, reported to the Detective Team, which arrested a suspect named Yao Gongcai and sent him to the District Court for interrogation. The prosecutor interrogated the case several times and prosecuted it in the criminal court. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Chen Kangsun specially opened the Eleventh Court for trial. The plaintiff, Ji Wang, did not arrive. After the judge took the seat, he ordered the detained Yao Gonglin to be brought to the case. According to Hong, he is 27 years old, a native of Zhenjiang, residing on Taiyuan Road in Zhabei, and currently works as a boilerman at the Citibank Mansion. The judge asked if he knew Zhou Long's coat. He replied that he did not know him. He asked if he knew the deceased, Ji Agen. He replied that he did. The judge asked if Ji Agen's wife, Ji Wang, accused him of shooting her husband. He replied that it was a false accusation. He explained that he had previously served as a detective under Captain Yang of the Kunshan Public Security Bureau. Someone accused Ji Agen, and he was ordered to arrest him. As a result, due to insufficient evidence, Li was released, leading to a grudge. He did not know who instigated her to accuse him of murder. It was a false accusation. Moreover, he had once worked at the Lihua Printing Factory behind the Jiangyuan Lane in Xinzha. In July of that year, because the printing factory closed down, he was unemployed at home. Because his uncle's farmland was busy, he took his wife and children back to Zhenjiang Yuanlai to work together until the end of the year before returning to Shanghai. After being recommended, he went to work at the Citibank Mansion. He requested an investigation. The judge, after hearing the statement, postponed the hearing because the plaintiff had not arrived and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the Shanghai Public Concession Public Works Department Telephone Expert Committee yesterday, expressing its opinions on telephone charges. The original letter stated, "Dear Sirs, since the Shanghai Telephone Company installed automatic machines, it has requested to increase user rental fees, adopt a per-call charging method, and continue to collect communication fees for the Chinese Concession. The merchants and people of this city have expressed different opinions. Our Chamber has repeatedly received appeals from various trade associations and has repeatedly forwarded letters to the Concession authorities and the telephone company, requesting them to consider public opinion and not increase prices hastily. Chairman Yu of our Chamber has also sent a letter to the Chairman of the Public Works Department, stating the inappropriateness of repeated price increases and per-call charging methods. Now that your committee is holding a meeting to discuss this issue in detail, hoping to reach a fair and reasonable solution under the contention of both parties, our Chamber and other organizations such as the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Concession have formulated opinions and sent them for your consideration. In short, Shanghai is in the grip of the global economic downturn, and commerce is extremely depressed. It is not easy to survive. The Shanghai Telephone Company only cares about its own generous annual interest and does not consider whether users can afford it. It insists on going its own way, and the citizens cannot agree to the increase in charges. In addition to the various opinions that have been detailed in the letter to the Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Concession, we hereby send another letter, hoping that your committee will conduct a thorough study of these opinions, accommodate them as much as possible, so that this case can be resolved fairly, thereby reducing the burden on the citizens. We are deeply grateful."</p>

<p>The City Chamber of Commerce previously received a letter from its member, Zhenguang Petroleum Company, regarding whether accounting books for the transfer of raw materials and finished goods between the factory's warehouse and the factory should be affixed with stamp tax stamps.

The Ministry of Finance has now responded to the Chamber, and its original text reads, "According to current regulations, accounting books used for trade must be affixed with stamps. There is no provision for exemption for those used internally that do not give rise to external rights and obligations. The Stamp Tax Act, which will be implemented from September 1st, also stipulates in the nature column of the tax rate table for accounting books that all general and sub-books established by various businesses, stores, or banks in connection with their operations belong to this category. The accounting books used by Zhenguang Petroleum Company to record the quantity of raw materials and finished goods between the warehouse and the factory are established in connection with their operations and should be affixed with stamps. The provisions of Article 3, Section 8 of the Stamp Tax Law are limited to documents and do not include accounting books.

<p>Since the Rent Reduction Association of the Special District issued rent reduction statistics for various districts over the past two months, the total number has reached more than sixty cases. After an average rent reduction of 20%, the rent reductions in Hengfeng, Sida, Hengsheng, and other nearby lanes on Shigaota Road are particularly large. Continental New Village has reduced rent to 72%, Wenhua Villa to 72%, Xingye Lane to 83%, and Dongxi Lane to 80%. The landlords of Hengfeng, Hengsheng, and Sida Lanes have not only not expressed a willingness to reduce rent, but have increased the rent in Sida Lane after January 28th, resulting in a difference of six or seven yuan per month in rent for houses of the same size. The situation in Hengfeng Lane is also the same, with some tenants receiving special preferential treatment from landlords and receiving rent reductions, while others do not receive preferential treatment and are simply happy to face the sun. Although the landlords of Hengsheng Lane do not have discriminatory practices towards tenants, because the rent is too high, there is even more need to demand a reduction. It is found that the landlords of Hengfeng, Hengsheng, and Sida Lanes have not only not expressed a willingness to reduce rent to reduce the burden on tenants, but have implemented discriminatory measures, which have increased the suffering of tenants. Moreover, the current economy is declining, and all industries are withering, with a downward trend. Therefore, the tenants of the three lanes have stood on the same front since yesterday, organized a rent reduction branch, suspended rent payments, and are waiting for a solution. On the one hand, they sent letters to inquire about the attitude of the landlords, requesting a reply. On the other hand, they sent letters to the Zhabei Rent Reduction Committee and the First Special District Rent Reduction Committee for filing, requesting them to send personnel to guide and assist. In addition to preparing all documents and sending them to various tenants for signatures and seals, they will express a strong protest to the landlords.</p>

<h3 id="e143">Publication of "On Military Virtue" <a href="#e143" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c143" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">143</a></h3>
<p>Miao Bin (Picheng), a member of the Central Committee, believes that China has emphasized civilian affairs and downplayed military affairs since ancient times, leading to the current state of national decline, which is beyond repair. Therefore, he spent a year writing "On Military Virtue" in thirty chapters. It first describes the way to survive through military strength, then the principle of using civilian affairs for military purposes, so that civilian and military affairs are unified and return to military strength. It then points out the military virtue of Confucius, who has been regarded as a sage of civilian affairs for two thousand years, in order to correct the misconception that Confucius was not military. It goes on to explain the distinction between kingship and hegemony, with kingship being an expansion of hegemony, correcting the prejudice that kingship values virtue and not strength. It then describes the principle of strength and gentleness, explaining that gentleness is also a way of military strength, and that gentleness does not mean the absence of military strength. It then describes the principle of action, stillness, emergence, and retreat, in order to show the democratic spirit of the Book of Changes and its doctrine of moral governance. Therefore, it lists the inherent virtues and commonly seen terms in daily life, explaining them one by one, selecting new meanings to conform to military strength. Those who were known for their military virtue in ancient times are also listed to show that it is grounded in reality. Central Committee members Dai Jitao and Sun Zhesheng highly praised it. It can be called a central treatise for the revival of the Chinese spirit. The book has now been published and is being distributed by the Kaiming Bookstore.</p>

<p>Regarding the matter of correction: I recently read an article entitled "The Rudeness of Train Passengers" in the local news section of your newspaper on the 3rd. According to the passenger, his name is Lin Shiliang and he works in the Secretariat of the Central Bank. Upon reading it, I was deeply surprised. After checking, Lin Shiliang, an employee of our bank, has not left Shanghai, and he did not go to the station on the morning of the 2nd. It is clear that someone is impersonating him, which is extremely despicable. I am writing to request a correction. Sincerely, the Office Affairs Section of the Secretariat of the Central Bank, September 3rd. To the esteemed editor of the Shenbao Newspaper. Regarding the matter of explanation: I recently read an article in the local news section of your newspaper stating that a whale specimen made by the Municipal Zoo will be completed and available for exhibition in a week. This is not entirely consistent with the facts. After checking, the large whale purchased by our zoo has been inspected for nearly a year. Due to its large size and lack of a museum, it has not been exhibited in a timely manner. After several requests, we were ordered to collect the houses behind the Jin Yang Fu Hou Dai in early summer. However, the original houses were not suitable for use and were renovated, which took a lot of time. In order to meet the needs of all sectors who are eager to browse, we have submitted a request for funds to start the renovation, and at the same time, we have entrusted the Oriental Instrument Company to first peel and prepare the full-shaped specimen of the fish. Now the whole shape of the whale has been installed, but the surface has not yet dried and hardened, and all the projects for renovating the houses listed in the request have only completed half of the total work. The one-week exhibition is difficult to realize as scheduled. Our zoo has been planning this specimen repeatedly and has not been able to complete it early. There is really no way to repay the citizens' expectations and the concerns of the journalists. We will continue to find ways to complete it as soon as possible. I am writing to publish the facts in the letter column in order to avoid misunderstandings and create unwarranted criticism. Shanghai Municipal Zoo, September 3rd.

<p>(Special Telegram from Peiping) Peiping City selected swimming athletes to participate in the National Games. Today (the 1st), the city's swimming competition was held at the Zhongnanhai Swimming Pool. More than 400 male and female athletes, officials, local officials, and spectators attended. The situation from all parties is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Opening Situation: The opening ceremony began at 9:00 AM. Chairman Yuan Liang was unable to attend due to business. Vice Chairman Cai Yuan delivered the opening speech, stating that the athletes participating today are enthusiastic. Last year, there were only more than 50 people, but this year there are more than 80 people. However, Peiping has a population of more than one million, and only 80 people are participating in the swimming competition, which is still too few people who love water sports. It is hoped that next year's meeting will have more athletes than this year, better results than this year, and especially that citizens will love swimming more than students. Not only break the city record, but also break the national record and the Far East record. In the future, they will be able to show their skills in the World Games swimming pool.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 1st Dispatch) The Ministry of Education issued an order on the 2nd to all provincial and municipal education departments to establish nine key points for promoting phonetic transcription of Chinese characters: (1) Textbooks for mass schools and short-term elementary schools, all word lists in literature and elementary Chinese language courses, and elementary social studies, nature (or common sense), upper elementary Chinese language, social studies (or geography and history), nature, and health textbooks should all use phonetic transcription of Chinese characters completely. (2) The phonetic symbols should be taught first in the first semester of the first grade of elementary school, and the main text of Chinese characters should be taught after proficiency is achieved. In the future, all newly compiled elementary Chinese language textbooks should have a separate book compiled before the first volume, specifically using phonetic symbols to compile stories for teaching purposes. The teaching method should be based on synthesis first, followed by detailed analysis, phonetic practice, and recognition of individual symbols. The above regulations should be implemented by the local educational administration in areas where there is a shortage of teachers teaching phonetic symbols, and temporary changes should be made. (3) From July of this year, all newly compiled textbooks and textbooks for mass schools must comply with these measures, otherwise they will not be approved. (4) All normal schools at all levels in provinces and cities should teach phonetic symbols so that normal school graduates have the skills to teach phonetic symbols. (5) During the transition period, all elementary schools must extract a part of the time in the Chinese language course to specifically teach phonetic symbols. (6) From January of next year, all editors of children's and mass reading materials must use phonetic transcription of Chinese characters for printing. (7) The Ministry and the educational administrations of various provinces and cities should encourage all newspapers to use phonetic transcription of Chinese characters for printing as much as possible within the possible scope.</p>

<p>Paraded in the City Center, Greatly Welcomed by the American People</p>
<p>(Ya Ya Yuantong News) On August 6, thirteen Chinese Boy Scouts, led by Yan Jialin, arrived safely in Seattle. Beforehand, Lu Shiyin, the consul of our country stationed in Seattle, contacted the Immigration Bureau, Customs, and local authorities and overseas Chinese leaders to receive and entertain the Boy Scouts upon their arrival. When the Boy Scouts arrived, Consul Lu and directors of the Chinese Chamber of Commerce went to the pier to welcome them. They specially prepared several private cars to take them to the Overseas Chinese Hotel for a short rest. Then they lined up to parade and visit various scenic areas. In the evening, overseas Chinese compatriots held a banquet to welcome them. After the banquet, the Boy Scouts performed various skills in the Chamber of Commerce Hall. Hundreds of people in attendance praised the Boy Scouts' energetic spirit, which was enough to show the glory of the nation. The next day, they obtained a Boy Scout parade permit from the police station and lined up to parade in the city center and visit the Chinese Consulate. During the parade, applause was incessant along the way, and some even shouted "Long live the Republic of China." That night, the Boy Scouts prepared to travel east to participate in the 25th Anniversary Boy Scout Commemorative Conference in the United States. Just as they were about to leave, they received a telegram from the Washington Boy Scout Headquarters, informing them that President Roosevelt had announced that the conference would be suspended due to the outbreak of an infant epidemic in a certain two countries in the East. Team leader Yan consulted with Consul Lu about the solution. As a result, they participated in the Northwest Boy Scout General Camp in the United States, which was fifty miles from Seattle. The Seattle Boy Scout Headquarters specially prepared a special ship to send them there. Participants included more than two hundred Boy Scouts from the Philippines and Canada. On the 13th, they returned to Seattle, and in accordance with the instructions of the Nanjing Boy Scout Council, they prepared to go to the eastern United States to conduct a profitable inspection of the Italian army. That night, Consul Lu, together with representatives of overseas Chinese compatriots and overseas Chinese Boy Scouts, saw them off and telegraphed the authorities of important cities through which the Boy Scouts passed to give them preferential treatment.</p>

Excerpts are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Committee Member Zhuang's Opinions: 1. The promotion of compulsory education should have adequate opportunities for experimentation. 2. Subsidies for compulsory education funding should be graded based on performance reviews. (2) Experimental Short-Term Elementary School Curriculum Standards and Textbooks Proposal: The scope of experimentation, in addition to the one-year curriculum standards and textbooks, should include two-year short-term elementary school systems, two-part teaching systems, and other related issues. Suitable schools should be designated for experimentation. Detailed measures should be discussed and formulated by Committee Member Chen Lijiang, Committee Member Zhuang Zexuan, and Committee Member Wu Yan. (3) Compulsory Education Inspection Issues Proposal: 1. Inspection matters should be drafted by the General Affairs Department. Special attention should be paid to inspections within this year, focusing on the amount and nature of self-raised compulsory education funds in each province and city, the actual use of compulsory education funds, and the number of newly established short-term elementary schools and the number of students they accommodate. 2. Each province and city should submit a detailed report to the Ministry by the end of October this year, including the actual amount of funds raised, the number of schools established, and the number of students newly enrolled. The department will organize this information and issue it to the inspectors as a basis for inspection. (4) Funding Issues Proposal: 1. In the future, central government subsidies for local compulsory education funding in each province and city, in addition to the original standards, should include the performance of each province and city in implementing compulsory education. 2. Before the end of December this year, the education departments and bureaus of each province and city should, in conjunction with the Compulsory Education Committee, report to the Ministry on the sources and fundraising plans for compulsory education funding for the next year for review. 3. The budget and implementation plan for compulsory education funding for the next year should be prepared and reported to the Ministry for review by the education administrative organs of each province and city before the Spring Festival.

<h3 id="e172">Chen Deqi's Letter to the Songjiang County Education Bureau Regarding the Merger of the Seven-County Jointly Established Women's Normal School <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>Chen Deqi's letter to the Songjiang County Education Bureau states: "Greetings, Deqi has moved to Nanjing for twenty years and has not been involved in Songjiang's educational undertakings. On August 22nd of this year, while returning to Songjiang from Beijing via Zhenjiang for personal matters, I met student Chen Guisan on the train, who informed me that they were attending a meeting at the Education Department. The next morning, I saw a report in the Songjiang newspaper stating that the Songjiang Seven-County Jointly Established Women's Normal School was ordered to be closed, and the students were to be merged into the Huangbo and Qixiashan Rural Normal Schools. Deqi found this to be peculiar. The improvement of schools and the establishment of normal schools by the province are the responsibilities of the education authorities. However, to issue the order at the beginning of the school year, instead of before the summer vacation, puts the young and weak female students in a dilemma. I dare to speak out on behalf of the students. After returning to Beijing, I reported the situation to the Ministry of Education and the Provincial Government, urging them to investigate with the Education Department. The Director of the Department replied that the official document for the closure had long been sent to the Songjiang County Education Bureau. Who should be responsible for this evasion? Fortunately, the dates of issuance and receipt of the document are clearly stamped, and the truth will eventually come to light. I recall that when Deqi was managing schools in Songjiang, the children of Songjiang were often reluctant to travel far from home, especially girls. Even with the Seven-County Normal School located in Songjiang, female students from other counties would only be at most a hundred miles away. Parents would still be concerned. Now, merging them into the Qixiashan Rural Normal School, is it beneficial for the students? Can their families bear this burden? Disregarding the facts and talking grandly about education is tantamount to destroying education. Using the original local funds to run local businesses, the establishment of this school was carefully considered. Now that the funds have been allocated to the Qixiashan School, will the people of the seven counties remain silent? Now I hear that your bureau has invited the heads of various education bureaus to discuss the aftermath of the school. For the convenience of the students, why not merge them into the county-established normal school that the Education Department has approved, rather than taking a long detour and preventing the students from moving forward? I respectfully submit my humble opinion and request that you discuss this matter impartially. While generally complying with the orders of the Education Department, the methods can be modified. I wonder what you think. Please inform me of the results of the meeting as soon as possible. Addressed to the Songjiang County Education Bureau, Chen Deqi, September 2nd."</p>

<p>— Original by Ms. Louisa May Alcott, translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>"You must be very careful; watch your tongue, eyes, and hands, because these can easily give people a false impression," Mr. Bhaer once said to Nat during this enticement talk.</p>
<p>"I know, I don't mean to, but it's a lot easier if you aren't too truthful. I used to do it all the time because I was afraid of Pa and Old Nick, and I still do sometimes, but I'm afraid the kids will laugh at me. I know it's bad, but I forget," said Nat, as if overwhelmed by the recollection of his sins.</p>
<p>"When I was a little boy, I used to tell lies too; ah, really outrageous lies. Later my old grandmother cured me — can you imagine how? My father and mother warned me, punished me, and even cried over me, but I always forgot, just like you. Then my dear old grandmother said, 'I'll help you remember and cut this bad habit at its root.' As she said that, she took out a shiny pair of scissors, dipped them in cotton wool soaked in alcohol, carefully cleaned them, and then pulled out my tongue and pricked the tip of it with her scissors. Needless to say, the blood flowed immediately. It was truly terrible, I won't lie to you, but it did me a lot of good, because my tongue hurt for several days, and every word came out very slowly, so I had time to think. After that, I became more cautious, and the result was good, because I was afraid of those big scissors. But my dear grandmother was the most loving to me in everything, and when she passed away far away in New Braunfels, she still blessed little Fritz that he could love God and be honest."</p>
<p>"I never knew my grandmother, but if you think this method can cure my problem, I'll let you prick my tongue with scissors," said Nat bravely, not without fear of pain, but sincerely wanting to stop his bad habit of lying.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Finance: Fluctuations in Exchange Rates, Ups and Downs in Specie Premiums, Once Breaking the 70 Yuan Barrier, Resulting in a Drop of Six Yuan One <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market was fluctuating, with both rises and falls. The foreign exchange market was also constantly changing. The downward trend in the morning session was still strong, once breaking the 70 yuan barrier for domestic goods. There was a rebound, and the Indian silver price increased continuously, but ultimately it remained weak. The morning began with only a slight increase in the overseas silver market. The New York and Monte Carlo markets were closed. It was said that after the closing of the major silver market, speculators were maintaining the price above .0625 or .125, which further weakened market confidence. The exchange rate situation slightly contracted. The price of gold in London rose by 1.5 pence. Off-exchange trading opened at around 80 yuan. Fuxingyong and others sold, causing the price to fall. The opening was low. After the opening, the Central Bank announced its exchange rates, with both the British and American currencies remaining flat. The customs gold unit remained unchanged. The standard price for specie was announced to be 925.2 yuan, which was somewhat stable but did not break through the 80 yuan barrier. Banks immediately began selling, causing the exchange rate to harden and fall, but there was a rebound after the fall. It was anticipated that the HSBC would announce its exchange rates, with both the British and American currencies remaining flat, but the banks continued to sell actively, and buyers were hesitant, causing the exchange rate to loosen significantly. The selling pressure in the market was constant, resulting in a severe drop, once falling below the 70 yuan barrier. Banks took advantage of the cheap prices to purchase US dollars, and buyers took the opportunity to trade at low prices, which led to a rebound. Speculators rushed in. The HSBC purchased foreign exchange, causing a temporary rebound, but the buying interest stopped when prices rose. It was predicted that the Indian silver price would rise by 14 annas, and the selling pressure increased again, leading to continued weakness at noon. The market stabilized in the afternoon session. The exchange rate had stabilized, and buying interest was relatively strong, causing the price to rise. However, because the initial Indian silver price was reported to be up 14 annas, the price remained high. Domestic banks purchased again, and market confidence improved, causing the exchange rate to tighten and gradually rise, once approaching the 80 yuan mark. Foreign banks, such as HSBC, continued to sell at high prices, and the actual selling pressure had not disappeared. The Indian silver price then rose by another 3 annas, causing the market to weaken again. The final trend was hovering. The overall situation for the day was extremely chaotic. Given this hovering situation, market confidence was naturally uncertain. The Italo-Ethiopian dispute caused different psychological reactions. The outlook is feared to be even more uncertain. The market situation for the day is recorded below:</p>

<h3 id="e176">Foreign Banks' Selling Intentions are Very Strong, The Foreign Exchange Market Continues to Loosen <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>According to foreign dispatches yesterday, New York and Canada were closed. Only London's major silver market was unchanged in the near term, with a 65-point increase in the long term. It was said that after the closing of the market, speculators were maintaining the price above (625 or 125). The final transaction increased by 125. The price of gold in London rose by 1.5 pence.

Compared to the previous close, the British and American currencies each strengthened by 0625. The Central Bank announced its exchange rates, with both the British and American currencies remaining flat. The customs unit was not changed, and there was not much impact. The banks' selling appetite remained strong and hardened. HSBC announced its exchange rates, with both the British and American currencies also remaining flat, with some struggling. However, the banks' selling intentions did not diminish, and the strength to maintain the price was lacking, causing it to loosen again and again, once extremely hard. The banks took advantage of the opportunity to buy US dollars, and the market stabilized. HSBC and others reluctantly showed buying interest, and there was some tightening, but the market continued to loosen due to the forecast of a 14-5 anna increase in Bombay. The market slightly stabilized in the afternoon. The banks conducted mutual transactions, but the market tightened due to the purchase of domestic goods, and because the Indian silver price was reported to be up 14 annas, foreign banks continued to sell. Domestic goods were still being purchased, which stimulated market sentiment and tightened the market, but HSBC and others took advantage of the high prices to sell. In addition, the Indian silver price rose again by 3 annas, and the market hardened again. At the close, the near-term selling price for the British pound was 1 shilling 6 pence 115, and the US dollar was 37.375 yuan.

<h3 id="e177">Call Money Rate Rises, Double Mills Increase Sharply <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the situation in the market was similar to that of the previous few days, but there was a lack of backing support. The demand for call loan transactions seemed more active than in the past, so the competition for the call money rate resulted in an increase of 0.2 cents compared to the previous day, calculated as 0.6 cents. However, the number of new transactions remained small, with a total transfer amount of over 3.8 million, new transactions of over 400,000, afternoon transactions of over 300,000, and transactions in the small general association of over 500,000. The market for adding water to the call rate has been stagnant for a long time, and yesterday remained the same, with uniform white marks. There was also no strong momentum in the small general association, so there was no addition of water from beginning to end, only white marks. However, in terms of backing support, the call rate and transfer rate were sufficient to offset the deficiency, which was not as large as in the previous few days. As for transactions in foreign currency mortgages, it is now difficult to engage in such transactions, so the amount of transactions is also small. As a result, redemption is not as common as before. Yesterday, over 900,000 was redeemed, and only over 300,000 was newly made. Banknotes were recovered for over 600,000, and over 500,000 in circulating notes and over 300,000 in secret-marked notes were issued. According to investigations, both Chinese and foreign banks had inflows in the closing price differences for foreign exchange, specie, and foreign stocks. Foreign merchants had over 1.5 million, and Chinese merchants had over 1.2 million. Other banks had routine receipts and releases. Foreign banks released over 2.8 million in ticket payments and over 4 million in various cargo exchange mortgages and miscellaneous releases. Remittances were over 700,000, special remittances were over 700,000, foreign exchange settlement payments were over 800,000, and warehouse entries were 500,000. Chinese banks released over 1.5 million in ticket payments, over 4.1 million in various cargo exchange tax mortgages and miscellaneous releases, over 400,000 in telegraphic transfers, over 900,000 in special remittances, foreign exchange settlement payments were over 700,000, and warehouse releases were 600,000. Japanese banks released over 2.4 million in ticket payments, over 3.5 million in various cargo exchange and miscellaneous releases, foreign exchange settlement payments were over 700,000, special remittances were over 500,000, and telegraphic transfers were over 700,000. Warehouse entries were 400,000. Banks received over 17 million in foreign public singles, over 4.22 million in foreign transfer fees, and over 500,000 in remittances from various routes and released 300,000. As for Jiangnan small silver, the situation was weak, with the same price of 830 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, a change of small 2.5 yuan. Transactions were made for 2,000 silver coins in the morning market and no transactions in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver had a sudden turnaround due to strong buying demand. Due to the scarcity of this commodity, the supply was very limited. Although the market price was high, transactions were rare. The opening price in the morning market was 744 yuan, 1.5 yuan better than the previous noon. The afternoon market rose another 1.5 yuan to 745.5 yuan. The result was a total increase of 4 yuan in both markets. Transactions were made for 195,000 silver coins in the morning market and 100,000 silver coins in the afternoon market. Copper coins suddenly decreased by 3,000 to 342,000 copper coins. Transactions were made for 10,784 strings, equivalent to 9,000 yuan in foreign currency.

<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange was hovering in the morning but suddenly rebounded in the afternoon, with a strong upward trend. It was rumored that the Ross Company expressed sympathy for a certain group, and the amount was also large. The market was stirred up, and there was eager covering of short positions and new long positions. No. 48 suddenly became stronger and bought actively. No. 46 and No. 78 also bought very enthusiastically. The trend showed signs of recovery. However, even if the rumor is true, it is not a short-term matter. The future upward trend will inevitably have reversals. The morning and afternoon sessions yesterday were very stable, and transactions were very quiet. The market price fluctuated only between 0.05 and 0.1 yuan, which was quite sluggish. In the afternoon, No. 48 and others suddenly came out to buy, and the amounts were large, so the market price uniformly rose by 0.05, 0.1, or 0.4 yuan. The closing price for treasury bonds also increased by 0.4 yuan. Other various bonds also increased by about 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. There were few sellers on the floor, and there was a possibility of continued increases. The total result of the market price was a uniform rebound of 0.1, 0.2, or 0.65 yuan. The total number of transactions was 721,200 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are compared in the table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3 id="e179">Gauze Flowers: Gauze Market's Ordinary Situation Lingers <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>The gauze market experienced a morning dip followed by an afternoon rise, but the overall situation remains ordinary. This is largely because the Mid-Autumn Festival is approaching, and according to commercial practice, there is usually a period of settling accounts. Amidst this financial tightening, the market exhibits signs of decline. Most speculators are constrained and have ceased operations, resulting in reduced trading and a lack of market vibrancy. It is said that the afternoon rise was influenced by a slight increase in the cotton market.</p>
<p>(Golden Rooster Brand Yarn - Corner Prices) The pre-market opening for branded yarn shows a slightly tight situation in recent days. Prices for all months have risen by twelve or thirteen corners, but buyers are not particularly enthusiastic. Trading in the second and third tiers remains stable, without significant changes. The market is not very active, and many traders are settling accounts. Towards the closing bell, prices for all months suddenly dropped. It is reported that yarn sales are slow, and some bulls are closing their positions, leading to exhaustion. Consequently, the closing prices for all months are down by one, two, three, or four corners compared to the previous day's closing price, except for the current month, which rose. In the afternoon, trading opened, and the forward months suddenly surged, tightening the market situation. Buying interest increased slightly, and the second and third tiers continued to rise by several corners. Due to unfavorable weather, raw cotton prices slightly increased, leading to a corresponding rise in yarn prices. However, at the closing bell, it was reported that yarn sales to customers were sluggish, and prices retreated by three or four corners. As a result, prices for each month rose by two, four, five, or six corners compared to the morning closing price. The recorded sales included 300 bales from Da Feng, 1200 bales from Geng Feng, 400 bales from Tong He, 1500 bales from Xin Cheng, 700 bales from Shen Ji, 400 bales from Yong Da, and 300 bales from Ming De. Purchases included 400 bales from Da Fu, 750 bales from Jin Chang, 450 bales from Chang Yu, 700 bales from Run Kang, 800 bales from Da Chang, 450 bales from De Ji, 650 bales from Zhen Da, and 600 bales from He Xing. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>(Yarn Sales: 400 Bales) Current yarn sales have turned quiet again. Statistics show that a total of 402 bales were purchased throughout the day, with prices similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each region are listed below: Yunnan: 40, Inland: 170, Fellow Traders: 42, Guangdong: 35, Shantou: 40, Xiamen: 21, Jiangxi: 2, Wuhu: 5, Ningbo: 3, Changsha: 10, Xuzhou: 25, Nanjing: 5.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Yao Flower Sources Surge Daily <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market initially declined but then rose. Overseas American and Indian cotton markets are closed. The local market situation is also calm. Because the situation for new cotton from various regions is still good, the sources of Ningbo Yao flowers are surging daily. However, in the afternoon, due to the hot and humid weather, there is concern that this could lead to a typhoon disaster. At present, it is the crucial time for picking cotton, and the weather has a significant impact.</p>
<p>(Zheng Biao Brand - Morning Dip, Afternoon Recovery) The pre-market opening for branded cotton saw a decline of one corner for October alone, indicating a weaker market. This is because the sources of Ningbo Yao flowers are surging daily, and prices are becoming cheaper. Overseas cotton prices for each month are down by five fen to one and a half corners compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon, the market suddenly trended upwards, and the situation became firmer. Buying interest returned to the market, with many attributing it to the hot and humid weather and the fear of a typhoon. As cotton is in the stage of flowering and picking, rainfall is crucial. Therefore, there were more buyers, and the market suddenly rose. Consequently, October rose by two and a half corners compared to the morning closing price, and the forward months rose by one and a half to two or three corners. The recorded sales included 2000 dan from Yuan Da, 800 dan from He Xing, 3300 dan from Chang Feng, 2400 dan from Xin Cheng, 1800 dan from Yuan Xing Chang, 1700 dan from Geng Feng, 2200 dan from Yong Da, and 900 bales from Yi Kang. Purchases included 2700 dan from Da Ji, 1600 dan from Ming De, 1500 dan from Shen Ji, 1100 dan from Yuan Yi, 1900 dan from Yi Kang, 1600 dan from He Xing, 1700 dan from Chang Yu, 1100 dan from Ren Feng, 1100 dan from Yi Chang, 1300 dan from Run Kang, 1600 dan from Yuan Xing Chang, and 1400 dan from Ding Heng. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day are listed below.</p>
<p>(Cotton Sales Quiet) Current cotton consumption is becoming increasingly subdued. The mills' intake is not consistent. The sources included 1652 bales of Yao flowers, priced at 28.80. Guangdong supplies included 300 bales, with warehouse delivery priced at 28.20. Fellow traders supplied 200 bales. Additionally, Shashi supplied 4200. Shen Xin's intake was 109 pieces, sent to the mills.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market was closed due to Labor Day. British spot cotton fell by nine points, and futures fell by one to four points. The Indian cotton market was closed. The original telegram reads (from a Japanese telegram):</p>

<h3 id="e182">Grains: Flour Market Depressed and Lacking Vigor <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market remained sluggish in both the morning and afternoon sessions. With foreign imports suspended, the sentiment among industry insiders and outsiders alike lacked a basis. The market situation is such that most customers are watching and waiting, and their activity is minimal. Although the inland merchants believe that the price of wheat cannot remain stagnant and tend to view it with optimism, the current domestic consumption has not increased. Therefore, the mills' purchases will also be cautious and unhurried. Amidst this mutual restraint, the market atmosphere is depressed and lacking vigor. Trading remains quiet every day. Ultimately, one must observe the economic recovery in various regions for buying and selling to become lively. As a result, the prices for the fifty months were slightly lower by half a fen, November and December were lower by two and a half fen, January was better by two and a half fen, and February was lower by half a fen.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Futures and Spot Wheat Are Both Weak <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the wheat futures market saw a decline in all months, as spot wheat prices fell, and sentiment weakened. For the near-term months, the inventory held by inland merchants saw sluggish sales, and some customers gradually sold off their positions. The floating bulls outside the industry also closed their positions one after another. As a result, the market atmosphere for all months uniformly declined. Observing the future trend, one should expect a continued weakening. As a result, September fell by three fen, October fell by one fen, and December fell by three fen. The spot wheat market saw smooth deliveries, but prices fell by two fen, as the mills' intake was flat and unable to support higher prices. Shandong wheat opened at one yuan, six jiao, and two fen, Yao Wan wheat at two yuan and six jiao, Jiangbei wheat at two yuan, five jiao, and a half fen, lower grade at five jiao and two fen, Luhe wheat at three yuan, five jiao, and a half fen, Jiangxinzhou wheat at two yuan, one jiao, and five fen, and Zhenjiang Nanjing wheat at three yuan, five jiao, and a half fen. Youhe Da purchased 6000 bags, and Fufeng purchased 1000 bags.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Foreign Rice Merchants Anticipate the Italy-Abyssinia War <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign rice market situation was firmly positioned. Following the previous day's surge, cargo owners were very firm in their thinking and unwilling to reduce prices to sell. Moreover, the arrival of foreign rice was scarce, and inventories were low. Yesterday, telegrams from Saigon and Burma indicated that production prices had risen across the board by three to four jiao, due to fears that the Italy-Abyssinia conflict would escalate, potentially involving Europe and the United States. Local rice merchants were hoping for a favorable outcome, and future orders were becoming closer to fulfillment. The market atmosphere was therefore tense. Although local customer demand was weak, prices instead edged up by three to five fen. The total sales for the city included 661 bags of Yongyi machine-milled rice and 1600 bags of Saigon rice, 460 bags of small-grain Siamese rice. Except for the lower grades and broken rice purchased by inland and Ningbo merchants, all were taken in by the local market.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, more than ten boats arrived from various regions (with a total of nearly 3,000 dan of goods). The market situation initially appeared tight, but as the weather turned sunny, sentiment became hesitant. Local sales were sluggish, and the amount taken in by the Qingdao merchants was only about 400 bags. The market color was only in a stable position. The prices of various thick japonica and thin indica rice did not see any significant rise or fall. As for the new japonica rice, the river cargo lacked high-quality, resulting in a price increase of several jiao, while the factory cargo remained steady. Although the arrival of new Yangchuan half-grade goods has become scarce, sales have not been strong. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, twenty-seven or twenty-eight boats arrived from various river routes. The market sales of white japonica rice were sluggish, and the market situation was close to weakening by a jiao. The arrival and sales of Dongxin japonica rice were balanced, and the market price was stable and hot. The situation was stable. The retail sales of thin indica rice with high-quality materials were quite active, while the middle and lower grades were sluggish. The market situation saw a two-jiao increase for high-quality materials, while the middle and lower grades weakened by a jiao. The retail sales of high-quality white Yuan were quite good, while the middle and lower grades saw a slight increase in sales. The price situation saw a two-jiao increase for high-quality materials, while the middle and lower grades were close to tightening by a jiao. The new Tuanjian rice was priced firmly, while the new Yangjian rice weakened by a jiao. The new Kejian rice transported by train had no class, and retail sales were flat. The market sentiment turned weak, and the overall market showed a slightly softer trend compared to yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e185">Wen and Tai Merchants Are Still Handling Soybean Cakes <a href="#e185" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c185" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">185</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean cake market situation remained unchanged because the Wen, Tai, and Ningbo merchants were still inquiring. Currently, the mills have stopped production, and there is only existing inventory being offered on the market. Yesterday, Shunyu Mill released 82 pieces of four-brand cake, Daju Xin Mill released 100 pieces, and Changde Mill released 1000 pieces. The others lack inventory for the market. Since the selling price of new soybeans has become loose and cheap, the sources have relatively decreased, and the destination is selecting high-quality goods to take away, while the lower quality goods are slower to sell.</p>

<p>Yesterday, New York was closed due to Labor Day, and the silk prices in the coastal areas fell back by a little over ten yuan. The firm Shanghai silk market is also gradually trending towards weakness (the market price of white factory silk, grade 13 to 22, has already fallen by more than 20 yuan compared to the beginning of last week). However, transactions are still possible. Dachang and Jing have seen a slight increase in intake.</p>
<h3 id="e187">Pingshui Green Tea Trading Is Still Active <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the silk and tea market situation saw a mixture of smooth and sluggish sales. There was no significant progress in the sales of high-grade green teas from Tunxi and Xi County. The British and French firms are very indifferent due to tight foreign prices and daily rising exchange rates. The market for green teas from Lu Zhuang is still in a slump. However, trading in Pingshui pearl tea is still active. Yesterday, Xiehe, Jinlong, Tongfu, and other firms in the market purchased large quantities of "Shangzhu, Zhurui, and Xia" grades of tea from this route, totaling over 1,300. The majority were transported to the United States for sale.</p>

<p>Although the summer sales season for Hongjiang tung oil has passed, sales continue through autumn, albeit sparsely. Among the various brands, Zheng Hong, Ji Chang, and He are the most popular. A few days ago, they were selling for 31 yuan per barrel, but recently, the market inventory has become scarce. When purchased from merchants in Zhenjiang, the cost to this port is 31 yuan and four jiao. Therefore, the local firms are selling at cost. Secondary brands such as Yang Hengyuan, Qing Yuanfeng, and other first-tier goods are still selling for 25 yuan per barrel.</p>

<p>Since the shortage of the No. 14 large black plate iron, there has been a shift towards using thick black plate iron. As a result, the sales of thick black plate iron in the market yesterday were exceptionally strong. It was reported that forty or fifty boxes, which are two hundred and fifty-six hundred pound varieties, were sold at a price of sixteen yuan and five jiao per hundred pounds.</p>

<p>A high wall stood very firmly. At some point, a vine climbed up the wall and grew more and more. A storm came, the wall collapsed, and the vine fell too. If the wall hadn't had the vine clinging to it, I don't think it would have fallen. If the wall had the vine clinging to it, and there hadn't been a storm, it wouldn't have fallen so quickly either. Friends! Isn't this an economic storm period? If you want to survive in this world, I want to ask you: Are you living by relying on others? Do you have the strength to support others' reliance?</p>
<p>Justice seems to be like a face, which is normal in ordinary water. However, once there are waves, the face becomes deformed. Therefore, a person who can calmly walk the path of justice in times of crisis is a remarkable person.</p>
<p>When you see children playing with soap bubbles, the bigger they blow them, the greater the disappointment when they break. Therefore, when a person wants to do great things without strength, the sorrow of future failure will be even greater. It is better to be down-to-earth.</p>
<h3 id="e192">Bathing and Singing <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Yin Feng</p>
<p>A person who starts their day with a bath begins their good life from then on. If they sing a few songs or hum a few lines of Peking Opera while bathing, it will be even more wonderful. Whether the force of the emitted tones is balanced or not is not important, but cleanliness and singing should be made into a close combination.</p>
<p>Taking a bath early in the morning, without interruption, is like taking a tonic that nourishes the entire body. The action of soap and water on the skin is a powerful aid to health. Rubbing with a sponge soaked in cold water is a stimulant, and massaging the muscles with a towel afterward helps the blood flow to all parts of the body with more strength. It can also stimulate the internal organs, enabling them to work vigorously. Bathing stimulates every pore, allowing it to discharge as much waste as possible from the body that can harm people, and it can also enable the skin to cope with any changes in the climate.</p>
<p>Singing while bathing, the bather expands his lungs, opens his ribs, and massages his digestive organs. His heart beats stronger, his tired muscles become elastic and lively, and his fatigued nerves regain their original energy. Therefore, to make one's day happy, there is no other joyful sound besides the song while bathing. To increase energy and restore fatigue, there is no more economical and convenient method than the cooperation of bathing and singing.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Give Me Money, Not Life <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Ying</p>
<p>The street performers often slap their chests and shout, "Give me money, not life!" Immediately afterward, they jump through a frame full of sharp knives, each no more than a square foot in size. Then the people around applaud and cheer, and are compelled to "spend money, spend money."</p>
<p>This scene is originally comical, because those sharp knives are all movable. When the performer jumps through, the strong man standing by the frame presses a mechanism to turn the knife heads away. But every time I hear "Give me money, not life," I can't help but forget the comical element and feel the seriousness of this life problem.</p>
<p>Being a robber used to be a capital crime. Nowadays, if you are unlucky, you might get shot, and your life is not guaranteed. But since ancient times, the number of robbers and the number of robberies have been recorded incessantly in history, and even today, this profession seems to be flourishing. Furthermore, when manufacturing and selling red pills and drugs, those who are caught are sometimes shot, and sometimes imprisoned for ten or fifteen years. Being shot means losing one's life. Long-term imprisonment can also mean a nine-out-of-ten chance of death. But despite the strict laws, manufacturers and sellers are still everywhere. Do these people not fear death? Well, to put it bluntly, it's just "Give me money, not life."</p>
<p>Miners face the danger of being buried. Spray paint workers and workers who work with flowers are at risk of developing tuberculosis within twenty years. Even rickshaw pullers, it is said, cannot live long. But those who do these jobs still work desperately. What is this all for? Isn't it "Give me money, not life"?</p>
<h3 id="e194">The Problem of Socks <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Bo Guang</p>
<p>A sock factory owner told me: "In modern society, all industries feel like they're in decline. The trend is really bad! As for socks, they are indispensable for men and women, so this can be considered a relatively stable industry. Who knew that in modern society, they have also become something that people reject, which has greatly impacted our business. Who can we tell our sorrows to?" Many modern women are showing off their shapely legs, going barefoot, and wearing openwork leather shoes like the straw sandals worn by monks, calling themselves modern! This is truly hopeless! Fortunately, many women have unsightly frostbite scars on their heels. So, we used our clever brains to redesign a pair of short socks. Once promoted, they became very popular in society. The owners of shoe stores also helped us a lot. After producing openwork leather shoes, it's unsightly if the socks are broken. You must buy new ones, so this has recovered half of our business." After reading the above, should socks be worn or discarded? I remember that a certain party member in Suzhou petitioned the county government to prohibit women from going barefoot in order to maintain social morals. Later, a certain lady defended the practice, and the whole city was in an uproar.</p>
<p>In my opinion, now that the New Life Movement is being vigorously promoted, going barefoot will inevitably be criticized, because men must button up their collars, so how can women go barefoot? It might be a good idea to find a compromise and wear short socks. I wonder if the ladies would agree with my humble opinion?</p>

<p>Chapter 18: The Corrupt Party Attempts to Climb Up, Fawning and Flattering the Petty Officials; Female Power Erupts, the Commotion Annoys the Mistress</p>
<p>What could Jie Fu say? He could only manage a wry smile. He was just calculating in his heart how to tear down the slogans one by one. After thinking about it, there was only one way: to wait until late at night, when the travelers had all settled down, and then go to work. Even if the bellboy saw him at that time, it wouldn't matter; he could just say that he was doing it on the orders of the commissioner. After thinking about it for a while, he closed the door: he felt very frustrated. Currying favor with the wealthy and getting rebuffed was a very common thing. But like today, being rebuffed and not being able to leave it at that, but having to personally tear down the slogans, that was really unlucky. He could have asked the bellboy to do it, but the bellboys here were very snobbish. They used to think that I was someone with no ability, so they wouldn't work hard. Now that there was a whiff of him being connected with Commissioner Lan, if he asked them to do something, they would definitely ask for a huge bribe. Now, he couldn't care about appearances. He would do it himself late at night. He thought about it over and over again in his mind, but he kept pacing back and forth. Confused, he endured until nightfall. Fortunately, he had planned to tear down the slogans late at night, so the faster the time passed, the more it suited him. But as soon as it got dark and his mind settled down, the noise in the inn just wouldn't stop. Anxiously, he stood on the balcony for a while, and then went to look in the front two halls. But he didn't dare to meet Jia Duo Cai, because he was afraid that Jia Duo Cai would ask about the progress of his contact with Commissioner Lan. (307)</p>

<p>Later, I found out that she was concerned about the stiffness caused by the egg white, fearing that excessive movement of her mouth would cause the layer of egg white film on her face to crack, losing its effectiveness. This layer of egg white was probably applied after she had eaten dinner and would not be washed off with soap and water until half an hour or forty minutes before she went to bed.</p>
<p>The empress dowager used soap that was not very good, because she didn't like to use things bought from the outside. So these soaps were made especially for her by a few eunuchs. The raw materials they used were rose or jasmine juice, combined with several unknown oils, and frozen into blocks of soap with different floral patterns. These soaps had a very strong fragrance, but their ability to remove dirt and grime was not high. However, the old lady didn't think they were useless and continued to use them very contentedly. Her knowledge of soap was definitely more extensive than that of all other foreign goods. She could name four or five brands of Western soap. I had also gotten her several boxes of top-quality French soap, and although she said she was happy to use them, she always said that their fragrance was not as good as the ones she made herself. Originally, there were dozens of scents of soap, so what I liked might not necessarily be what the empress dowager liked, and what she liked might not necessarily suit me. I just thought that the quality of soap lay entirely in its ability to remove dirt and grime, so why insist on its fragrance? Unfortunately, I didn't dare to say these words to the empress dowager!

<h3 id="e197">On "Miscellaneous Excerpts" <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Fang'an</p>
<p>In a previous Spring and Autumn issue, a certain gentleman published an article discussing "Yi Shan Miscellaneous Excerpts," highly praising Li Shangyin's work. In this year when small-scale literary magazines are in vogue, it is difficult to find such light and humorous writing that also expresses the common feelings of the world, as desired by everyone. "Yi Shan Miscellaneous Excerpts" truly stands the test of time!</p>
<p>According to the Siku Quanshu edition, edited by Lu Ji of Yun Jian: "Ancient and Modern Stories" also includes three volumes of Miscellaneous Excerpts, the first of which is "Yi Shan Miscellaneous Excerpts." The full text consists of forty-one entries. The aforementioned gentleman has already fully described its merits, so I will not repeat them here. However, anyone who has read this article must have felt the same desire to express the pervasive nature of the world! Among them, there are also two entries, "Must Be Poor" and "Must Be Rich," which can serve as a lesson for the world. It is not only remarkable for its humor.</p>
<p>The middle and lower volumes collected by Story Sea were continued by Wang Junyu and Su Zizhan. Wang and Su were both Song dynasty figures, and their descriptions all express the common feelings of the world, as desired by everyone. They are no less impressive than "Yi Shan Miscellaneous Excerpts" and can even be mistaken for it. For example, Wang's continuation says:</p>
<p>"Useless Things</p>
<p>Marrying a daughter to a eunuch, asking them to have tea after a meal, being a guest on a vegetarian day. Quitting gambling after running out of money, giving up drinking after killing someone, promising to do good before dying..."</p>
<p>And Su's continuation says:</p>
<p>"Not Trustworthy</p>
<p>A seller's asking price and curses, a monk not eating meat or drinking alcohol, a matchmaker boasting about good children, a prostitute crying as if she doesn't want to leave, an enemy country negotiating peace."</p>
<p>All these excerpts fit the world's circumstances perfectly and contain profound principles. Now solemn, now humorous, writing like this has reached the realm of transformation. Today, some people translate humor as witty remarks, which is the ultimate expression of wit. Are there such witty remarks in modern humor magazines?</p>
<p>Regarding this type of writing style, there are many imitations, though incomplete, in old magazines, especially in the various issues of Minquan. However, compared to the works of Li, Wang, and Su, they are far behind. Those who wish to understand human nature amidst the unpredictable world should take and read them. Isn't this just to while away the time?</p>

<p>— Wu Yafei</p>
<p>It was a morning when "winds fill the tower foretelling a mountain storm." Me, Xiong, and I, the two of us, stepped onto the damp streets, chatting and laughing as we walked along. Passing the old graveyard, the district office, and the Double Guanyin Temple, we arrived at Macun. From there, we took a turn, walked along a narrow, stony path, and reached Shangzhen Temple. The path to Shangzhen Temple cut through the rice paddies, with boundless fields stretching out on either side. Many farming couples were kneeling in the rice, pulling weeds, their backs bent low, heads down, crawling through the mud row after row, leaving deep muddy furrows in their wake.</p>
<p>"Hoeing millet under the noonday sun, sweat drips onto the soil beneath; who knows that every grain in the bowl is the fruit of bitter toil?" I stood on the bank of the field for a long time, lost in thought, reminded of city people who waste white rice, unaware of the hardship of farming in the countryside. They cannot even imagine how difficult it is to harvest a single grain.</p>
<p>When we arrived at Shen's Market, Mei encountered a relative, so she couldn't go with us and went back to entertain the relative. However, we couldn't abandon our trip to Tianwang Temple, so Xiong and I continued towards Huangye Ridge.</p>
<p>After passing Shen's Market, the road became covered in coal ash. This was because it was the main transportation hub for the "Chengjin Coal Mine." On Huangye Ridge, a branch road led down from the mountaintop; it was a shortcut to Shouzheng. Above the mountain, there was also Tianwang Pond, covering tens of square li, a vast expanse of misty water. The end of the pond was in Xincun Bay, while the other end reached Shouzheng. The pond was filled with lotus flowers and water caltrop, but there was only one ferry boat here, operated by a young woman in her twenties. Although the roads along the shore were more convenient than traveling by water, some people still preferred to wait for the ferry.</p>
<p>"It's strange, how can there be a river on the mountaintop!"</p>
<p>"This is the mystery of creation. Mountains use unique terrain; it's beyond human effort and imagination."</p>
<p>After passing several stone houses and scattered graves, we climbed up an earthen mound. Descending from here, a mountain gate stood quietly before us. Unfortunately, the four large golden characters of "Tianwang Ancient Temple" had been almost completely eroded, leaving only faint traces. Passing through the mountain gate, we arrived at the site of the "Chengjin Coal Mine's" coal extraction. However, due to the erratic management of those in charge, the coal mine was never developed properly. Now, it is not only closed down, but it has also harmed a large number of people and destroyed many places!</p>
<p>Here, a large brick road led toward a pine forest by the stream, where a long, winding path could be seen leading directly to Tianwang Temple.</p>
<p>At Tianwang Temple, only the row of meditation rooms on the east side still existed; the other buildings, like the main hall, had been reduced to piles of rubble. Although the Buddha niche of the Second Tathagata still had a few broken tiles on top, it couldn't block the sun during the day or protect from the dew at night. The two ancient wells in front of the hall had long ceased to ripple, and the two ancient pine and cypress trees, it was said, had been struck by lightning five years ago and turned into charred wood.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Reason and Emotion <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>If we make a rough analysis of humanity, we can say that some people are rational, while others are emotional. We can also say that reason is scientific, while emotion is literary. Rational people and emotional people are completely different. For example, if we read a play, and it is a tragedy, an emotional person will shed tears, while a rational person will remain unmoved. They already have a preconceived notion: "This is fake." They might even laugh at the emotional person, saying they are worrying about people from the past. Rational people see everything in the universe as cause and effect. For example, if a rational person sees a soldier beating a rickshaw puller, they don't feel pity for the weak. They think that the rickshaw puller is beaten because he is weak. If he were stronger, he could beat the soldier. For example, when small nations are oppressed, emotional people produce a lot of literature filled with blood and tears, while rational people work on the other side. They believe that "the weak are prey to the strong" is a principle. If you don't want to be oppressed, you must have the ability to resist oppression. As another example, everyone knows that flies are the worst thing. A rational person will say that flies must be completely eliminated. So they see flies as enemies, while an emotional person doesn't pay much attention to them. Sometimes, they might feel extremely uncomfortable after accidentally killing a fly. The English poet William Blake was like this. He has a poem that says:</p>
<p>"Little Fly,</p>
<p>Thy summer’s play</p>
<p>My thoughtless hand</p>
<p>Has brushed away.</p>
<p>Am not I</p>
<p>A fly like thee?</p>
<p>Or art not thou</p>
<p>A man like me?...</p>
<p>..."</p>
<p>Because of the death of a fly, he can think of the illusion of life, which is also like a fly. Who can say that a person in the universe is not like a fly? But a rational person might think this is ridiculous.</p>
<p>The thinking of a rational person is fixed, and it is not easy to shake their thoughts. An emotional person is the opposite. Their emotions change at any time, and their thoughts change accordingly. When they are happy, the moon they see is beautiful and bright; when they are sad, the moon becomes desolate and dim. When they see the moon in a foreign land, they say: "If the moon has feelings, it should recognize me, seeing each other year after year in a foreign land." A rational person thinks that the moon is the same everywhere. Li Shangyin's poem, "Chang'e should regret stealing the elixir, night after night, her heart in the blue sea and sky," is filled with too much emotion. A rational person would think this is too虚無. "The moon is a dead sphere," so a sentence completely overthrows thousands of years of myths, articles, and poems about the moon. Therefore, the thoughts and emotions of a poet or writer cannot be imagined by a scientist. When they are bored, they may imagine that trees are their friends, with the two lines of poetry: "Old friends are like trees in the courtyard, becoming more sparse with each autumn wind." They can close their eyes and see deep mountains and valleys. In this forest, there are orioles calling, and on the river, there are two fishing boats. They close their eyes again, and everything changes. There is a palace, a garden, grass like green felt, and a fountain, with the bright moon reflecting it. There are also three or four beautiful palace maids. Their imagination is very fast. They mix their imagination with their emotions, and the resulting writing is beautiful and moving. Therefore, the component of literature is emotion. Without emotion, only the beautiful shell remains, which is worthless, like the two lines of poetry mentioned above, "If the moon has feelings, it should recognize me, seeing each other year after year in a foreign land," and Blake's poem. If the emotion in these poems is removed, there are simply a few meaningless words left. Scientists are not good at analyzing the emotions in literature, so they feel that literature is a bit boring.</p>
<p>Speaking of emotion in literature, I can't help but think of Cervantes' Don Quixote. Most people think Don Quixote is a ridiculous character, but I think he is a person with extremely strong emotions. Because his emotions are too strong, he completely loses his reason, and his every move seems ridiculous. He tied his helmet tightly with a blue cloth and went to an inn, refusing to let anyone cut the blue cloth. He was willing to wear the bulky thing to sleep. When he saw two prostitutes, he thought they were noble virgins. When they took off his armor, he felt very honored, so he sang:</p>
<p>"There is no knight in the world like me,</p>
<p>Who has ever been served by a beauty,</p>
<p>Like me, Mr. Don Quixote,</p>
<p>Coming from the countryside to meet a beauty!</p>
<p>A beauty serves me in person,</p>
<p>A princess holds my horse."</p>
<p>From this, it can be seen that he has completely lost his reason. He only has passion, the passion to be a knight, to conquer the evils of the world, and to stand up for the wronged. So, wooden figures become real Moors in his eyes, and sheep become knights. Turgenev has an essay on Don Quixote, in which he says:</p>
<p>"His whole body is permeated with a strong moral force, which gives all his judgments, all his words, and his personality a unique power and greatness, no matter how comical he is, how often he is trapped in humble poverty. But the power and greatness given to him by morality still exist... Don Quixote is a loyal servant of 'ideal,' a great enthusiast, so he is often illuminated by the glory of this 'ideal' and retains his glory."</p>
<p>It is true that Don Quixote is a great enthusiast. We don't have his kind of enthusiasm, so we find what he does extremely ridiculous, but he himself thinks it is very serious and must be done. So, our articles and poems, works that express our emotions, may be seen as extremely ridiculous and boring by rational people?</p>

<p>Leaving aside those abstract theories, let me give a few real historical examples. In the late Qing Dynasty, the tide of capitalism surged into China, and Chinese society could not remain unchanged. It had to change, and the speed and amplitude of the change increased along with the power of capitalism in China. This was inevitable. But in the process of change, there were many small causes to pay attention to. During the Hundred Days' Reform, if Emperor Guangxu had been able to strike first and imprison Empress Dowager Cixi; during the Boxer Rebellion, the powers would have divided China; the success of the Xinhai Revolution would not have been in Wuchang but in the Guangzhou Uprising, or the Wuchang Revolution would have failed; or the Qing Emperor would not have used Yuan Shikai, or decided not to abdicate. These many small possibilities and another chain of small causes—Guangxu was imprisoned, the powers did not divide China, the Xinhai Revolution succeeded in Wuchang, the Qing court used Yuan Shikai, and decided to abdicate—accounted for the same percentage. If the continuous system of small causes changed, the history of China would be written differently. Therefore, the study of history is somewhat different from the study of sociology. Sociology tells us the general process of social change, and history tells us the process of change in a certain society at a certain time and place. Determinism loses its effectiveness here. Liang Qichao advocated the theory of chance. In his lecture in Nanjing on several important issues in the study of cultural history, he completely denied the application of the law of causality in history, saying:</p>
<p>"The greatest task of induction is to seek commonalities, to remove dissimilar attributes, extract similar attributes, classify them, and stipulate the content and history of the car. This method, when applied to history, is absolutely impossible. Why? Because historical phenomena only 'pass by once.' Since ancient times, there has never been a historical event of the same type. Why is this? Because historical events are a reflection of human free will; and the content of each person's free will is absolutely not the same; therefore, the work of historians is exactly the opposite of that of natural scientists, focusing on seeking 'non-commonalities.' If the dissimilar attributes of many historical events are removed, and only the same attributes are extracted, the essence of history will be completely taken away. Therefore, I think: In the field of history, the efficiency of the inductive research method is only to organize historical materials, and cannot go further."</p>
<p>Subsequently, he put forward two bold conclusions:</p>
<p>First, "Historical phenomena can at most be said to be 'interrelated,' not causal."</p>
<p>Second, only "the concept of human equality and human unity, and the common cultural achievements developed by the minds and capabilities of all parts of the world" can be said to be the evolution of history, and the rest can only be compiled into the cycle of "one rule and one chaos."</p>
<p>His words are not without bias, but his criticism of the application of determinism in history is worth noting.</p>
<p>We can see the shortcomings of those who advocate the theory of chance from another historical example. In 1926, someone in Beijing put forward the slogan "Cao Kun came from a cloth-selling background and is now the President," as an inducement to recruit new soldiers. The person who came up with this slogan must have thought that "coming from a cloth-selling background" to become the President was an incredible miracle, like winning the lottery. In fact, they overlooked a series of small continuous lines. If we combine the "Beiyang Faction," "Kuomintang," and "Research Clique" political groups with the actual politics of the Republic of China, put Cao Kun in the Beiyang Faction, and do not ignore the fact that Cao Kun joined the military in Xiaozhan, then we can explain the cause and effect of coming from a cloth-selling background and becoming the President, and we can understand that this fact is not a miracle. Now, many historical facts, because the historical events have passed, the continuous line of small causes cannot be reassembled, so the determinists and the theorists of chance can only argue endlessly. Probabilists want to open up a new road to explain the facts in addition to the method of mediating the two sides.</p>
<p>We cannot call for past historical events to be re-enacted; we cannot get everyone to believe that if a certain small cause changes, history will also change its color. We can only find a similar fact to illustrate it; those who talk about mathematics and species seek it from gambling; and I also use the outcome of billiards to illustrate the position of "opportunity" in history. To say this, it takes a very long chapter, I will now only say my conclusion:</p>
<p>"Chance" is inversely proportional to the organization of the community; the more closely organized, the more "chance" reduces its importance; the more loosely organized, the more "chance" increases its importance. As far as history is concerned, the more ancient the era, the more important "chance" is in history; the closer the era, the less important "chance" is. But the history of any country in the world cannot be compared with the achievements of billiards; billiards can be said to have 95% certainty, while the probability in history accounts for more than 50%.</p>
<p>Therefore, when we look at the composition of social events, we must pay attention to the inevitable "cause," and at the same time pay attention to the "probable" cause.</p>

<p>— Bai Chen</p>
<p>Two children ran ahead, and their mother kept shouting, "Slow down, slow down." The children got impatient waiting in front and ran back again. But their mother still couldn't walk fast.</p>
<p>Outside the West Gate, everything was green. A patch of rapeseed flowers was set in the middle of the wheat field, shining like goose-yellow satin. A fragrance followed the wind, wafting into the nostrils in waves. The little monk and the little rascal jumped and shouted like wild horses.</p>
<p>"So much fun!" they shouted.</p>
<p>Their mother stopped and looked around, at a loss for words, and couldn't help but shout, "Oh my!..." She kept clicking her tongue and shaking her head.</p>
<p>The little monk plucked a rapeseed flower and ran back, and the little rascal also plucked one. The little monk said, "Mom, it would be so nice to live here!" His eyes were shining.</p>
<p>His mother sighed, "Children are like they are in heaven once they are out in the countryside!"</p>
<p>The children didn't understand what their mother was saying or thinking. They looked up and saw a magpie flying over, and the two of them ran forward again.</p>
<p>Thump!…</p>
<p>"Ah! Look!" The little monk shouted, pointing to the west. A round ball was flying in the sky. It fell down and disappeared. Then came another sound—</p>
<p>Thump!…</p>
<p>The little rascal was so surprised that he couldn't speak. He just stared blankly: "Huh?"</p>
<p>Far away, there was a white wall, and behind the wall, there were red foreign-style houses. The round ball was bouncing in front of the foreign houses and behind the white wall, but no one could be seen.</p>
<p>"Does the ball have wings?" the little rascal thought.</p>
<p>The little monk couldn't stand it anymore, and ran off with his little legs.</p>
<p>"Brother!" The little rascal chased after him.</p>
<p>"Stop! Don't run!" His mother shouted, chasing after them, her feet splayed out in a quick, awkward gait.</p>
<p>But the little monk ignored his mother and ran towards the white wall. The ball kept bouncing, "Thump! Thump!" as if kicking him in the heart. There was also laughter.</p>
<h3 id="e202">When Leaving Bailing Temple <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Yuan Chenying</p>
<p>Leaving Bailing Temple was on a crisp morning. Getting out of the cold covers, I couldn't help but feel a little nostalgic for the yurt I had stayed in for a few days. The blue sky that peeked out from the round hole on the top of the yurt, covering the Mongolian land, seemed to be smiling at me in farewell.</p>
<p>Outside the yurt, it was still very early, not even eight o'clock; the sun was still hidden in the sea of clouds in the eastern mountains, and a light mist surrounded the northern mountain peaks, the "Obo," the yurts, and the houses east of the river were shrouded in a few wisps of smoke and the morning mist. The cool morning breeze whistled by, like ice bullets hitting people's faces, and the air was as silent as if it had been frozen. The occasional sound of a car honking was accompanied by the melancholy breeze of the desolate wilderness.</p>
<p>I looked at Bailing Temple at the foot of the western mountain, which had lost its luster in the light mist, and suddenly felt a pang of sadness: For some reason, I didn't have the opportunity to see this great monastery in the sacred land of Inner Mongolia, leaving this young man who came to Mongolia specifically to see the Mongolian scenery with a disappointed heart. But I had seen a lot: the panic of finding "things" difficult everywhere, the primitive lifestyle of the Mongolian people... Haven't I already seen and heard a lot of these Mongolian scenes? Why should I feel such regret for not seeing Bailing Temple, which is similar to the Guihua Sheritu Zha (Note 1)?</p>
<p>The lamas in their heavy robes also seemed to know that we were leaving. They deliberately walked down from the slope in front of the temple, looking at us with a reluctant gaze. At this time, our boys and girls stood in a semicircle on the sandy ground, quietly listening to many Mongolians with braids surrounding a prince and speaking. A young man with a shaved head was translating, and the translator's words seemed to tremble in the cold air. I looked through the crowd and saw that the words of the Mongolian prince with long braids were like a light drumstick hitting a weak drum surface, the sound was so low and firm. Then came a passionate speech from one of our boys, but I knew that this was just temporary indignation. After a few days, when they left this desolate land that they thought was fresh, wouldn't our boys and girls still live their carefree lives?</p>
<p>After the boy finished speaking, we got back into the original four cars and set off on our way back. The songs of the boys and girls rose loudly, breaking through the cold air in the wilderness. The sun behind the eastern mountains revealed a ray of golden light, bathing the clear Mongolian land. Everyone's fingers were frozen and couldn't bend back, and the tips of their noses were also slightly sore from the cold. After getting into the car, the Mongolians with long braids standing in front of each yurt waved to us, and our boys and girls raised their hats and waved them, shouting the Mongolian phrase they had just learned, "Sai Shao, Sai Shao" (Note 2). Several Mongolian dogs barked wildly, as if they were seeing us off.</p>
<p>The car started moving. Bailing Temple at the foot of the four mountains and the scattered yurts, and the houses east of the river all moved backward. At this time, I turned my head, my heart was filled with all kinds of feelings; in my haste, I saw the yellow flag in front of the yurt, fluttering slightly in the wind under the golden sunlight.</p>
<p>Note 1: "Sheritu Zha is the most famous and largest monastery in the Guihua slope."</p>
<p>Note 2: "Sai Shao, Sai Shao" is a Mongolian farewell phrase, meaning good, good!</p>

<h3 id="e203">One of the Diplomatic Tactics <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>Afghanistan Grants Oil Rights to Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Amidst the war clouds gathering in Afghanistan, the news that the Afghan government suddenly granted oil exploration rights to British and American African Development Companies is noteworthy. According to a Reuters dispatch yesterday, the Afghan King signed an agreement with the African Development Company registered in Delaware, USA, granting the company the right to exploit mineral and oil resources for 75 years in an area covering more than half of Afghanistan. This area borders Italian Somaliland and the lowlands of Abyssinia on the Eritrean border. The news has shocked Rome.</p>
<p>This situation clearly deals a major blow to Italy and is likely to escalate the Italo-Afghan conflict. From an observer's—or a third party's—perspective, this move is either a plan to throw a bone between the southern dogs, or, at the very least, to give the rights to friendly Britain and the United States rather than the aggressive Italy. Although Britain and the United States have strenuously stated that negotiations for this matter began three years ago, signing the agreement at this time inevitably smacks of taking advantage of the situation. Italian officials have declared that such a concession is an unfriendly act towards Italy. Should Afghanistan fall under Italian control in the future, the Italian government will not recognize its validity. In short, this Afghan plan will not change Italy's determination to take action against Afghanistan, etc. This statement clearly means that if Italy's military action against Afghanistan fails, the matter is moot, but if it succeeds, these rights will not be exclusively held by the two countries.</p>
<p>However, my purpose is not to discuss that. What I want to talk about is the attitude of Britain and the United States. Because these two countries are in a suspicious position, their statements are naturally difficult. To say that they are truly involved in this matter would be an unfriendly act that disrupts peace; to say that they are completely uninvolved would become a problem if the country were occupied by Italy. The wording is extremely difficult. Therefore, looking at the recent statements made by the two countries, there is value in considering them.</p>
<p>Since Afghanistan announced the concession of oil exploration rights to the African Development Company, the British authorities issued a statement saying that the British government has not yet received verifiable reports. However, it feels obliged to inform the British Minister in Afghanistan that if this statement is true, the Afghan King should be informed that the British government, in order to fulfill its responsibility, should advise the Afghan King to withdraw the decree. The implication is that this is a private matter and has nothing to do with the government. However, the government is only fulfilling its responsibility by offering advice, but the British government dares not ask whether the advice will be effective. The United States Secretary of State also told the press that American businessmen rarely consult the State Department before negotiating such matters abroad, so the government does not pay attention to the actions of its citizens around the world. Private matters are not of concern to the government. The above two statements push the matter away completely.</p>
<p>However, the United States enjoys consular jurisdiction in Afghanistan, so the property rights of Americans themselves are under the jurisdiction of the U.S. consular officials. Since American businessmen have obtained this concession, the U.S. government has a responsibility to protect these rights. How could it not have paid attention to this beforehand? However, the State Department also stated that what we are discussing is only the present. If, after the Italo-Afghan conflict is resolved, American citizens holding legitimate property rights in Afghanistan demand compensation from one or both of the belligerent nations, the U.S. government will have no choice but to recognize their claims.</p>
<p>Therefore, according to this, their overall intention is that the government has no right to interfere in the private actions of businessmen now. However, if the interests of businessmen are harmed in the future, the government cannot but assume its responsibility. Therefore, one word or phrase in diplomacy seems extremely ordinary on the surface, but in reality, it often contains significant meaning. However, the eventual outcome will not be resolved by words but will depend on strength.</p>
<h3 id="e204">Going to Market <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Especially</p>
<p>— When will this long and arduous road finally end?</p>
<p>When the mountain mist was thick, dominating the earth, urged on by the porters, we began our day's journey. Here, if you lack strength, or if your existing strength is deficient, then you should go back early. There won't be a bowl of old rice for you. On average, each person has to carry sixty or seventy catties, or even seventy or eighty catties. Speaking of it, this weight isn't really that heavy, but don't forget that it's a "mountain road," and there's no rest in terms of time, unless the twilight swallows the sun and we throw ourselves into an inn.</p>
<p>If it were cold weather, then perhaps the thick clothing would provide some protection from the friction against the skin. Unfortunately, we were traveling in the sweltering summer. The porters' entire bodies, except for a bit of covering in the lower region, were completely naked. When the bamboo pole was placed on their shoulders, the pressure of the weight caused the pole to move up and down incessantly, and the skin on their shoulders went from light red to dark red, eventually seeping with traces of blood on their dark brown skin.</p>
<p>— Why don't they seek improvements in their equipment? I wondered.</p>
<p>If they could attach a soft, thick strap to the carrying pole, with loops at both ends to tightly secure the pole, it would definitely be of great benefit.</p>
<p>As usual, we walked through the vast mountains and fields, shouting, as if nothing else existed besides ourselves.</p>
<p>Judging by the situation, today was a bit unusual. Along the mountain paths and even in the surrounding fields, the number of people selling things had suddenly increased. Everyone had a hurried look on their faces, rushing forward quickly. Looking at the goods they carried, the variety was no longer as monotonous as before. Besides salt and eggs, there were also fabrics and other sundries.</p>
<p>— Why is it so lively today? I asked.</p>
<p>— Probably there's a market ahead, said the head porter, Zhang.</p>
<p>— There's a market here too?</p>
<p>— Plenty of them. There's one every three to five days at most, he said, in a very ordinary manner. You might even be able to catch two or three in a single day.</p>
<p>Let time pass lightly over our heads. One mile, two miles, slipped away in an inadvertent glance, finally stopping at a town. It's my own fault for forgetting to ask the name of this town at the time, although the impression it gave me hasn't faded with the passage of time. But now, when I think of it, I always feel regret.</p>
<p>The town was in the midst of a bustling market. The clock hands indicated that it was already noon.</p>
<p>— Let's eat here. Today we encountered a market, so we can eat better food, suggested Old Huang.</p>
<p>Of course, none of us had any reason to object to this suggestion. We stopped, and the porters scattered in all directions. Afterward, wanting to buy some better vegetables to satisfy our hunger, Old Huang and I walked from one end of the town to the other. The hustle and bustle enveloped the entire town. Such a noisy atmosphere was rarely seen after setting out on the road. There were so many people. The stalls on both sides were practically connected into a long line, without any gaps. Grains, food, supplies, everything was available. People who came to the market had expectations in their hearts, quietly seeking the things they hoped for.</p>
<p>Squeezing and squeezing through the crowd, probably because they don't bathe often, a sweaty, sour odor assaulted my nostrils. Slowing my pace, I walked into a large temple. Similarly, the temple was also crowded. Turning into the second hall, it became quiet. Inside, it seemed like there was a small school set up. Perhaps it was bad timing? I didn't see any students, only wooden desks and benches sitting silently.</p>
<p>I bought some pork at a pork stall. This could be considered a great treat. Every day, we had been using tofu pudding and salt as the only vegetables to go with our rice. What kind of feeling should I have toward this not-so-plentiful meat?</p>
<p>There were quite a few women appearing in the crowd. I don't know why, but what caught my attention especially were the women wearing floral cloth dresses. They were Miao women.</p>
<p>This was the first time I had encountered Miao women. From their sun-baked skin and strong backs, one could tell how brave and hardworking they were.</p>
<p>We stir-fried a plate of meat, ordered two more dishes with meat, and even drank some wine. We gathered around the square table and started putting food into our mouths. Outside the table, there were even more people gathered around than those eating, staring straight at us, perhaps thinking that it was infinitely rich, I thought.</p>
<p>Not daring to delay any longer, we raised the whip of the vanguard, opening a path through the crowd of thousands.</p>
<h3 id="e205">Morning in Gongjiapu <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Yafei</p>
<p>When a round sun, its face flushed red, had just peeked out from the east, the people of Gongjiapu, men and women, young and old, all left their beds and moved about in the village. Fourth Sister-in-law also got up from the bed at this moment. Looking at Fourth Brother lying on the bunk, still snoring loudly, his snoring sounded just like a dead sow. She reached out and nudged him twice. He reluctantly turned over, mumbling something in his mouth, but still fell soundly asleep.</p>
<p>"Hey, get up already! Aren't you going to pump water out of the field and fertilize it one more time?" She suddenly slapped the bed board. "Besides, this is what the whole village agreed upon. This is 'everyone' pumping water. If anyone doesn't show up, they'll be fined two boxes of 'fang gao' [方糕, a type of rice cake]. It's already late. Uncle Ade just came to call us a while ago, and the gong at the temple square was already rung long ago. We don't have money at home to buy 'fang gao' for the fine..."</p>
<p>She had thought that her man had been working too hard in the fields lately: pumping water, weeding, pulling weeds, applying the first fertilizer... Speaking of pumping water, during the rice planting season, because the fields were dry, they had to pump water in from the outside, but now they had to pump it out. Heaven wouldn't let people save effort, what could they do? Although she understood her man's suffering, for the sake of eating, no one could have a moment of ease. They could only use everyone's sweat and blood to irrigate those rice plants, waiting for them to produce grain to pay rent and complete the grain tax. In the end, they could only leave some rice husks for themselves as food.</p>
<p>"Hey!" He sat up, yawned, and then stretched, looking like he hadn't woken up yet. "Has the gong been rung? How come I didn't hear any sound?"</p>
<p>"I called you for half a day, and you still didn't wake up, yet you want a bell to wake you up! Hurry up and go! We can't afford the fine."</p>
<p>He rubbed his eyes, still dazed, and rushed out the back door. Running to the edge of the field, he saw many people already there. Everyone was noisily chattering. Under the camphor tree, a dozen people were treading on the large waterwheel.</p>
<p>"Ah Si, you slept soundly. What time did you finally come?" Uncle Ade said, sitting next to the waterwheel, smoking his pipe, his tone somewhat reproachful.</p>
<p>"You went back to sleep early. It's easy for you to say. Last night, I was pumping water all night until after midnight! Even the oxen can't stand doing things this way. People aren't made of iron..." He said somewhat unconvinced.</p>
<p>"Okay! Stop talking and hurry up and take over for a shift. If you want to eat, you have to suffer a bit!" So a group of people came down from the axle, and Ah Si and his group went up to take their place.</p>
<p>The sound of the waterwheel, *luk luk luk*, was broadcast in the quiet air. People's voices of conversation were also intermittent, rippling around. The water in the field decreased bit by bit, and the green rice tips gradually emerged from the water.</p>
<p>Recently, everyone in Gongjiapu's face, in addition to the original hunger and melancholy, had added a layer of anxiety and fatigue. Every pair of eyes seemed to belong to an insomnia sufferer. Their faces had changed from white to green. Because since the flood had entered this place, they had hardly had a peaceful night's sleep.</p>
<p>*Iya! Iya!* Water was sucked up from the field, passed over the wheel blades, and sprayed out from the wheel spout, flowing torrentially into a small ditch, and then from that ditch into the Gongjia River in front of the village. At the river wharf, many women were washing rice and laundry. The sound of pounding clothes, *da! da!*, echoed wildly through space. One could faintly hear the echo sent back from the distant valley, preventing the pounding sound from feeling lonely due to its monotony.</p>
<p>"This is truly doing twice the work with one set of hands and feet. When we were planting the rice, the sky was so dry that not a drop of water fell. We still had to go a long way to pump some 'melon rind water' [a small amount of water] from the small pond. Now that it's the beginning of autumn and the fields don't need water, we suddenly have such a big rain, forcing us to pump water out of the fields. Shouldn't we farmers be able to save some effort?" Granny Ade said as soon as she arrived at the riverbank.</p>
<p>"Hey! It's lucky that we're blessed by the Bodhisattva, so the flood hasn't come yet! Didn't you hear Zhang the Taoist say in the teahouse that several provinces in China have already been washed away by floods, and countless people have died. The teacher at the elementary school also said the other day that many places in the East Ocean [Japan] have also been flooded. Listen to that, aren't you scared! If we had a big flood here, where would we escape to? Hmph! We wouldn't be able to survive. Although it's more difficult now, we can still plant the fields. This is because we villagers haven't committed any sins, so the Bodhisattva has come to protect us..." Auntie Ah Jin said with an air of being worldly-wise.</p>
<p>"Ugh! The world has changed now, and people are becoming more and more out of sorts. No wonder the heavens are sending down disasters. Look at the young people coming out now, they all look a bit like 'Little Longhairs' [a derogatory term for Taiping rebels]. Maybe they'll rebel in the future. Originally, heaven wouldn't treat people wrongly, but it does make the good people suffer along with the bad ones! Ugh!" Mrs. Zi Shun always lamented and cursed this world with heartfelt pain. She was a good person, but at her age, she still had to suffer with those bad people. Thinking about it, she felt really sad!</p>
<p>The water vortex slowly disappeared on the river surface, and at the same time, the sound of conversation gradually quieted down. People left the river wharf one by one. White smoke was rising from the chimneys of every house in the village.</p>

<p>"Beneath Mount Emei" Lyrics</p>
<p>Sentiment - Sung by Ms. Huang Jin</p>
<p>(1) After a long drought, the land is parched, every farmer loses sleep, worrying that the crops in the fields will wither and die, how can we make it through the year with just one grain, how can we make it through the year with a pained heart, parents and children weep to the heavens.</p>
<p>(2) Little harvest, heartbroken, how to arrange the lives of the old and the young. Village leaders and local bullies cause trouble and make noise, miscellaneous taxes and harsh levies come again and again, come again and again, how can we get off the stage, seeing living people being buried in the soil.</p>
<p>Sentiment - Sung by Ms. Huang Hou</p>
<p>(1) The moon is like a comb, a beauty makes a wish for a handsome husband, there is no firewood or rice during the day, no good bed at night.</p>
<p>(2) The crescent moon is sharp at the rain head, don't think about this year, think about the past years, fighting every year is still okay, but my man went to be a soldier and hasn't returned.</p>
<p>Lively - Sung by Ms. Huang Mei</p>
<p>Three turtledoves fly over the bay, oh wei, a pair comes together, one is alone, the pair flies to the acacia tree, the single one flies to Mount Falling Soul, ai yo ai yo.</p>
<p>Lament - Sung by Ms. Huang Hou</p>
<p>Swallows fly in pairs on the ridgepole, going out together in the morning, returning together at night, as if guarding an empty room for thirteen years, I don't know when my love will return.</p>
<p>Joyful - Sung by Ms. Huang Mei</p>
<p>Looking across the river, I see peonies blooming, yo wei, such beautiful flowers cannot be brought over, yo wei, I only wish that the heavens would send a heavy rain, yo wei, so that the wind would blow the peonies over, yo wei.</p>
<p>Lament - Sung by Ms. Huang Hou</p>
<p>A piece of soap bean bay is curved, brother and sister are separated by a thousand miles of clouds and mountains, drinking tea, want to see you, tears dripping in the middle of the cup.</p>

<h3 id="e212">"Madam Tart" Released <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Is there truly equality in the world? The disparity between the rich and poor classes is an obstacle that can never be eliminated in the love between men and women. But if wealth and honor suddenly come, not only will one transform into someone wrapped in brocade and wearing jade, but also be listed among the nobility, envied by those who are rich but not noble! Isn't this a profound satire on high society, a wonderful comedy? Therefore, "Madam Tart" is indeed similar in spirit to Melodibson's sensational "Too Madam". The starring stars are comedic veterans Alice Belardet, Doc Moncau Maule, and Annie Tailu, etc., and it is now being released by "Nanjing".</p>
<h3 id="e213">Yuan Meiyun in "The Storm" <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Qingyun</p>
<p>Yuan Meiyun, in the new film "The Storm" to be released by Yihua, plays a naive and lively girl full of youthful vigor, a very beautiful and lovely little bird.</p>
<p>She lost her beloved mother when she was very young. She leaned on her only father—played by Wei Heling—living abroad, happily living with her father. They had never been apart for a day. Her father loved her passionately, more than those priceless jewels, and would never abandon his only daughter.</p>
<p>Because the surrounding environment did not allow them to continue living such a wonderful life, and also because they had been away from their homeland for a long time, they took this opportunity to return to their homeland, Shanghai. This pair of father and daughter, who depended on each other, both imagined in their hearts: "We have strength, we have spirit, we return to Shanghai, our homeland, can't we still have things to do? Can't we still live a sweet life? What's more, there are still very powerful relatives in Shanghai who can help us." However, they brought this beautiful and bright hopeful heart to their homeland, Shanghai, but were unexpectedly struck, leaving a shattered, struggling in an environment of scheming people, and finally this young girl died pitifully under enemy bombs. Ah! Isn't this just like a rose about to bloom, destroyed and withered by "The Storm"?</p>
<p>Friends, I think you also believe that such a girl's role, played by Yuan Meiyun, is truly the most suitable, and only she is competent for such a role!</p>
<p>Sure enough, on the night of the preview of "The Storm", everyone who attended praised her acting skills, but when Yuan Congmei shook her hand to congratulate her on her success, she said: "This is your guidance that made me successful!" Friends, do you think this little girl is very clever?</p>
<p>Please pay attention to the release date of "The Storm", friends who love film and art, it will be released soon.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>I heard that recently a film company is planning to find a "lawsuit opportunity" for its new film.</p>
<p>What is called a "lawsuit opportunity." It is not setting up a seduction case or a rape case, because that is too old-fashioned in film promotion methods. Today's promotion methods require surprise wins, so the target of the lawsuit is found in the "journalist." It is said that as long as there is a slight disrespect to their new film or company, they will immediately "sue" you. Fortunately, the lawsuit does not have to be a guaranteed win, as long as it can cause a sensation. After the sensation, the plaintiff withdraws the suit or declares innocence due to insufficient evidence, isn't that acceptable?</p>
<p>As for the "journalist" side, a countersuit is unlikely, because it is expected that they do not have that much money. Even if a countersuit is filed, there will be no crime.</p>
<p>Isn't this a very good and fresh promotional method? What do you say?</p>
<p>I remember someone saying that if Chinese films could progress as quickly as their promotion, Chinese films would be saved.</p>

<h3 id="e219">Death of American Automobile Industry Tycoon Willys <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>American automobile industry tycoon I. N. Willys passed away in the United States on the 26th of last month at the age of sixty-one. His life's struggle for success is similar to that of French automobile king Citroen. He is also a notable figure in the business world. The most commendable aspect of Mr. Willys is his commercial and organizational abilities. At the beginning of his business, he experienced many difficulties. He started from scratch and created with difficulty. He turned a bankrupt company that was about to be taken over by property managers into one of the largest automobile enterprises in the United States through his meticulous planning and daily improvements. If it were not for his extraordinary talent and knowledge, how could he have achieved this? Mr. Willys and Citroen were indeed outstanding individuals. Now that they have passed away one after another, it is also considered an unfortunate event in their industry.</p>
<p>Willys was born in Canastota, New York, on October 25, 1873. He was known for his intelligence from an early age. Unfortunately, he lost his father and was unable to continue his studies. At the age of seventeen, he abandoned his studies and was initially employed by a lawyer. However, his income was too meager, so he resigned and switched to selling bicycles, which was more profitable. The following year, his business went smoothly, so he left his hometown and went to Elmira to engage in business, where he was able to fully display his talents. Mr. Willys' talent for business seemed to be innate. He was often correct in his predictions. His peers regarded him as a businessman. At that time, he realized that the bicycle industry was just beginning to develop and that its future achievements were limitless, so he devoted all his efforts to it. It was rare for a young man of eighteen to have such keen vision. He founded a bicycle sales company in Elmira. Its annual turnover reached US$500,000. Mr. Willys surprised everyone. A caged object cannot be compared to someone who has been lying in a stable for a long time. Believe it.</p>
<p>That year was 1908. Willys saw an advertisement in the newspaper calling for people to sell the automobiles produced by the Indianapolis Wafulan Company. At that time, the Wafulan car had four cylinders, which was much more advanced than the popular two-cylinder cars. The company had been established for six years, but its most prosperous year was only forty-seven cars per year. Willys was willing to work for the company as the general sales manager and planned to produce 500 cars per year. At that time, the person in charge of the company was Mr. Pile, who was amazed when he heard Mr. Willys' proposal. However, a disturbance suddenly arose during the consultation of this proposal. The company's executives told Mr. Willys that they were facing financial difficulties, and they were about to shut down. When Mr. Willys heard this, he rushed to Indianapolis to investigate. He saw that the factory was empty except for a few unassembled parts. It was Saturday and Sunday, and on Monday, the company would be taken over by the property manager.</p>
<p>Willys realized that the opportunity should not be missed, so he used his swift means. On the one hand, he negotiated with the Indianapolis factory, and on the other hand, he asked for help from friends in New York and Chicago. Finally, he raised 7,500 yuan from the board of directors of his Elmira bicycle company. After obtaining the funds, Mr. Willys began to reorganize the company. In the spring of 1908, the newly organized Willys Wafulan Company was completed. Mr. Willys served as general manager, treasurer, and sales director. He took care of sales and procurement himself. At that time, the automobile industry in the United States was still in its infancy. Mr. Willys' arduous management set a unique example in the industry, and he himself rose rapidly to prominence. The Willys Wafulan Company has been successful in the last twenty-five years. Mr. Willys' contribution is truly significant.</p>
<p>After establishing the Willys Wafulan Automobile Company in Indianapolis, Mr. Willys' business was further enhanced due to the failure of another company. This was due to Mr. Willys' commercial genius. At that time, the Pu Botu Erdu Company was unable to operate due to a serious strike. Mr. Willys saw the opportunity and began to plan to purchase the factory. However, his friends mostly disagreed with him. Mr. Willys was not shaken and finally purchased it in 1909 for US$285,000. After the grand plan was completed, the Wafulan factory moved from Indianapolis to Tu Erdu. The relocation of Willys Wafulan was suitable for both people and location. Its foundation became increasingly consolidated. The factory site gradually expanded to 119 acres, with 90 giant buildings covering an area of 7,000,000 square feet and employing approximately 23,000 people.</p>
<p>In addition to serving as the owner of the Tu Erdu factory for many years, Mr. Willys did not abandon his business in Elmira. He was unwilling to abandon the place where he started his business. Mr. Willys also served as the manager of the Willys Moro Company. In his spare time, he liked to collect antiques and treasures to pass the time. His collection of art was the most valuable in the Wa Haihua area.</p>
<p>Mr. Willys' contribution to the automobile industry has been roughly described above. However, his expansion of overseas markets contributed to the country and will be the most brilliant part of his life's work. He visited Europe several times to promote American cars overseas, especially when he served as the overseas director of the American National Automobile Dealers Association. He personally planned everything, and his contribution was outstanding. When President Hoover was in office, he appointed Mr. Willys as the first ambassador to Poland due to his familiarity with the situation in Europe. His negotiations were successful, and his political integrity was outstanding. His late-life achievements were especially regarded as an honor by people in the automobile industry.</p>
<p>Mr. Willys married Ms. Wen Hui from Canastota in 1897. In 1929, Mr. Willys sold his shares to a silver group for millions of dollars.</p>
<h3 id="e220">Recent Business Conditions of Automobile Factories in Various Countries <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>(1) Ford Factory</p>
<p>Although Ford's production has broken previous records in recent years, the material gains are difficult to satisfy. The factory manufactures vehicles using a mass production system. The simplest car body goes through dozens of simple steps to complete the entire vehicle. The advantage of this system is speed and simplicity. However, once society changes its styles for vehicles, this system suffers a major blow because it cannot be changed immediately to adapt to the needs of society.</p>
<p>The rapid change in car body styles has reached its peak in the past two years. The word "streamline" has almost become a mantra for every car factory. As a result, various uniquely shaped vehicles have appeared in major cities, such as reptile-style and torpedo-style, etc. The fierce competition is rarely seen in previous years. In order to maintain its reputation, Ford must, of course, follow suit. However, the economic losses caused by changing the design and transforming the machinery are enormous. Therefore, Ford's business conditions have been much more bleak in the past two years.</p>
<p>Ford's elaborate masterpiece, the V-8 car, used to be popular for a while. However, sales have not been very strong in the past two years. The sales of large cars are obviously sluggish, although the US government has now reduced car taxes.</p>
<p>The best-selling cars at present are light cars with about ten horsepower. The engines of these cars are obviously gradually improving. The compression ratio of the cylinders has been greatly increased. The pistons and cylinders are made of special alloys, so there is absolutely no danger of rust. Radiators and automatic lubrication machines are all made of the latest styles. The interior and exterior of the car body are exquisitely decorated, which is quite attractive to the general customers. According to statistics, the sales volume of light cars in 1934 increased by 20% compared with 1933. It is expected that it will increase to 35% this year, breaking the sales record of any previous vehicle.</p>
<p>(2) Nash Factory</p>
<p>The fastest-growing car factory in recent years is Nash. Its internal organization and manufacturing policy both adopt the latest scientific methods. Moreover, the engineers are mostly experienced. As a result of their efforts, the design has made obvious progress. Now it has almost become Ford's only strong enemy.</p>
<p>The sales of Nash's 15 to 20 horsepower medium-sized cars have a growing trend. The slender and streamlined car body, combined with an appropriate proportion, is really fascinating. Although the structure of the engine is not as exquisite as Ford's, its strength is more than sufficient. The exquisite design of various accessories on the engine is unmatched by any car. However, the price is relatively more expensive, which is due to the capital relationship.</p>
<p>The factory's sales of large cars in 1934 increased by 3.5% compared with the previous year. The sales of medium-sized cars increased by 23%, while light cars were about the same.</p>
<p>The factory held a grand factory promotion meeting this year, bringing together all the engineers, general managers, shareholders, consultants, and managers to discuss the improvement of the factory in detail. It is expected that there will be new developments in the manufacturing aspect this year.</p>
<p>Nash's capital has now expanded to more than ten times what it was before. Although it cannot compete with Ford under the current circumstances, judging from the rate of increase, it will become Ford's strong competitor in ten years.</p>
<p>(3) Morris Factory</p>
<p>The car factory with the most developed business conditions in the past two years is, of course, Morris. According to statistics, the total revenue in 1932 increased by 1,324,556 yuan compared with 1931. In 1932, it increased to 1,893,951 yuan. In 1934, it was 2,534,980 yuan. It is expected that there will be more significant progress this year. This rapid increase is unmatched by any car factory.</p>
<p>In the past few years, Morris has been dedicated to the manufacturing of light cars. Small cars with about ten horsepower have long been welcomed by the general public. In recent years, more attention has been paid to the manufacturing of medium-sized cars. The excellent engine installation and the exquisite style are unmatched by other vehicles. The car body is extremely streamlined.</p>
<p>Although the sales of large Morris cars are not as good as small and medium-sized cars, they are also well sold in various countries because of their excellent configuration. The price has gradually decreased, which is also the result of the reduced car tax.</p>
<p>(4) German Factories</p>
<p>The business conditions of German factories have also made significant progress. Last year, the sales of engines alone reached US$9,350,120. The value of the remaining accessories is, of course, very large. The sales of Daimler cars have broken all previous records. The car engines produced by German car factories in recent years are novel in style, occupy very little space, but have great horsepower. Moreover, even after the car auxiliary has traveled a very long distance, there is no need to pay attention to it. In recent years, the new Daimler cars have been selling well all over the world.</p>
<p>The increase in the speed of each car is already alarming. The highest rate reaches 200 miles per hour. Although the car body travels so fast, there are no vibrations or rollovers. This excellent spring system is really worth admiring.</p>
<p>Although the car factories in other countries have made relatively more progress in business, none of them have surpassed the phenomenon. Especially the British car factories. Perhaps due to the "conservative" nature, there is not much improvement in their vehicles. The styles are also a bit outdated. This is certainly inferior in terms of sales.</p>
<h3 id="e221">The Relationship between Accident Problems and the Rise and Fall of the Automobile Industry <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>The more accidents, the fewer customers; the fewer accidents, the more customers.</p>
<p>The automobile industry itself has a mysterious power, because when cars were first invented, people thought they were killing demons. But now anyone feels that cars are indispensable to mankind. Many people think that the progress in the construction of cars in recent years is enough to reduce the number of accidents. In fact, the number of car accidents depends on the intentions of the male and female drivers. Since the automobile boom, roads in various countries have been built one after another. In recent years, this thing called the automobile has been extraordinarily stable and rapid, and has even taken away the position of the train. However, although automobiles are becoming more and more popular every day, if the people who drive them lack a sense of morality, then the number of accidents will inevitably increase day by day. In the past, some people said that the only reason why cars cause injuries and deaths is that they can arbitrarily move left and right on the road, unlike trains, which have a certain track. However, people have now proven that this reasoning is wrong. If we drive a car out and are always careful to prevent accidents, then we will definitely not cause injuries or deaths. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, the traffic authorities have paid very close attention to road safety issues in recent years, so the "silent movement" has been implemented. At the same time, the registration of cars and the registration of drivers are also very strict. Originally, a good driver would not cause accidents on the road. Whether in the countryside or in the town, when driving a car, they will never accelerate arbitrarily. Although many accidents do not occur due to the driver's carelessness, but because the road itself has shortcomings, a good driver will choose the road and be able to see the danger in advance and find ways to avoid it.</p>
<p>In other words, a good driver will always be cautious and avoid all accidents. At the same time, they are more familiar with the road conditions. For example, where children are playing, where people are getting off the tram, and all the dangerous areas on the road, they all know. These are all common sense for drivers. If they lack this common sense, then driving out is very easy to cause accidents. Driving a car is actually a technique and not a science. When a person drives a car out, the first thing is to abide by the rules of the road, and at the same time, pay attention to moral issues, then there will be no accidents. From the perspective of the automobile industry, they also extremely welcome good drivers. With a good car, there must be a good driver to fully express the advantages of the car without causing accidents. Otherwise, there will still be no effect. From the perspective of the road, recently, like the authorities in London, the United States, have restricted the speed of cars in the streets to a maximum of 30 miles, which is also a method to prevent car accidents. When many car owners buy cars, they pay attention to safety issues. Not only do they want to be safe themselves, but they also hope that pedestrians are safe. Therefore, under this circumstance, the car factories are most afraid of male and female drivers causing accidents frequently. This is because more car accidents will scare away more customers. And the decline in car accident cases, on the other hand, is enough to encourage or attract customers to buy cars.</p>
<p>The car factories absolutely believe in this truth. Taking the United Kingdom as an example, the car factories pay very close attention to safety issues when manufacturing cars. The purpose is nothing more than to improve the safety level of cars and then reduce the number of accidents. After the accident record drops, it is enough to encourage or attract customers to buy more cars. British car factories first adopted safety glass, four-wheel brakes, and even on the smallest cars, the oil tank is placed at the back. The improvement of the transmission system and various devices are all products above the standard. Each of these reforms has saved many lives. So everything is worth publishing in the advertisement. Compared with the tires of twenty years ago, the new tires can undoubtedly save many lives. The new car lights, which can make them dim, also have the function of reducing accidents. Even the switches on the windshield have special value. In human history, the safety level of cars is probably no greater than today. British cars are safe, stable, and fast. They are indeed worthy of being called unique. However, this beautiful achievement requires good drivers to express it. Otherwise, it is still just as easy to cause accidents.</p>

<p>The value of a Morris car - A person named Jordan bought a Morris Eisher sedan in 1932 and used it in Iraq for three years. Recently, the "Autocar" magazine published a letter from him praising the value of the Morris car. The gist of the letter said that the car has traveled 40,000 miles. Some roads in Iraq cannot be called roads. In summer, they are high in one place and low in another, just some four grooves in the sand. In winter, they become some mud. However, to this day, the car has only repaired a small gear for the front spring and cleaned some spring chains because the mud and grease mixed together and were too blocked. It also added a new set of cylinder rings. These things were not necessarily needed in the first place, but they were added for the convenience of the recent annual cleaning and repair. The car is a sedan, as new as ever, without any squeaking noises. The car door closes easily with a slight push. Although some friends who are used to inferior car bodies must slam the door when they close it, the paint on the car has not faded to this day, even after the heat of 120 degrees under the shade of trees in the hot summer and the cold intrusion below zero in winter, it has not been affected at all.</p>

<h3 id="e224">Chinese Stone Paved Avenue in Ford Pavilion <a href="#e224" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c224" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">224</a></h3>
<p>From the ancient capital of Beiping to the summer palace eight miles away, the anchor stone avenue used in between, as shown in the picture, was commonly used by the Manchu imperial family. This road was paved more than 200 years ago. Although the large stone slabs are bumpy and uneven to this day, and not very suitable for modern wheeled vehicles, the situation is generally still good. This royal ancient road has been reproduced and included in the "Pacific Highway" of the Ford Pavilion at the San Diego California Pacific International Exposition. The stone paved avenue has become a part of China's long history. Since the Republic of China, good road construction has only begun in recent years. Today, China can be proud of many modern hard-surfaced roads for automobile traffic and high-speed comfort.</p>
