<p>（巴黎）今日得悉、法國將不顧英國之態度如何、决不安然順從德國廢棄凡爾賽相約、總理佛蘭亭與外長賴伐爾今日正從事起草抗讓書，其措辭將嚴厲抨撃德國元首希特勒之重行徵兵制、該項牒文聞明日經閣議通過後、卽將送往柏林、今日法國高級方面對於英國意欲承認德國廢棄和約、評責頗烈、迨聞英外相西門拒絕法國商請於赴德之前先來巴黎一行後、此項不滿之聲益高、法國一方面已進行與巴爾幹及小協約國家諒解深刻化、惟其當前最大之目標、則在欲得蘇俄之後盾、據可靠消息、外良賴伐爾已接受蘇俄之邀請、預定於本月二十七日可抵莫斯科、按賴氏　俄之時與英國掌璽　臣艾登亦將會面、如此則或將與史太林舉行三頭會議、消息靈通之政治觀察者宣稱、賴氏之行、雖以德國最近之舉動、欲求與蘇俄成立完全諒解、惟結果或將根據軍事互助之成議排除德國、而成立東歐羅迦諾公約、該約當先由法·俄·捷克三國締結、以後則愛沙尼亞。拉股維亞·及立陶宛大槪亦將參加、若干樂觀者甚至謂最後波蘭亦能加入、如該約成立、則無論德國如何、當難擾亂歐洲之和平矣、國際學者成認歐洲之亂源其實不在法德之間、而在中歐及巴爾幹半島，至於德國對於談約之反響如何、雖無人敢預測、惟大槪不致歡迎、苟一觀地圖、卽可知該約成立之後、德國東西南三方將悉被包圍、法外長之政策殊爲明顯、爲法國計、賴伐爾氏必須以東歐方面辦理妥善、始能於德國西侵之時、受東翼之牽制也、（十九日國民電）</p>

<h3>英空軍預算提出下院　新增三百餘萬鎊　總共計二三，八五一，〇〇〇鎊　麥唐納宣布新發明之空防法</h3>
<p>（倫敦）航空部次官沙遜爵土今日在下院提出一九三五年航空部之預算、規定新增之費三、〇八九、〇〇〇鎊、計全年經費總凈數爲二〇、六五〇、〇〇〇鎊、毛數爲二三、八五一、〇〇〇鎊、較一九三四年增多三、六八五、〇〇〇鎊、爵士宣稱、美政府在已往十年中爲和平起見、曾展緩實行英國至低之空防程序、英國空防之荏弱、實爲世界和平與英國本身之危險、英國不能再容其空軍在空軍國中第一道實力綫長處第五位、同時渠對於英國空軍之荏弱、不欲過甚其詞、現僅法俄兩國之第一道實力綫遠出英國、美意兩國飛機之數、僅稍勝英國、但在役之合格駕機員實較英國皇家空軍爲少、皇家空軍之飛機、其設計與操演、實不遜於任何國、但年來技術上之進步甚速、故今除增加機數外、且不得不重定設備之程序、渠希望將來可縮短新式機造成之時期、英國飛機製造業尚能獲利、一九三四年英國輸出飛機之總値較一九三三年增加百分之三十一、現有二十九外國用英國之飛機、三十三外國用英國航空之引擎、同時皇家空軍之擴張、已不得不首先增設飛機站與飛行塲、一九三四年預算所增經費三百五十萬鎊、多因此項工程之故、航空部現懸獎二萬五千鎊以募英國製造廠、製成最佳之商業飛機、今尚擬製造高度與長距離之試騐飛機兩架、如能滿意、則英國擬圖奪得世界高度與不着陸飛行之紀錄云</p>
<p>辯論特點之一、爲邱吉爾氏所發之言論據稱、上年十一月英德空車實力實相平等、此後英國之地位較劣、今日德國至少已有第一道綫之飛機六日架、而一九三五至三六年間尚有增加之可能、可達一千五百架左右、英國空軍之程序、極不充分、已入於甚危險之時期、且一九一八年終止之大戰、今甚有復作之可能、但渠仍希望且相信終可挽回云、沙遜爵士答稱、據政府所接之最近消息、現有種種理由可信英國之空軍今仍較德國爲强、</p>
<p>自上年十月起、大局惡化至某種程度、德國飛機之製造、已大見加速、但渠意至本年杪英國仍可稍佔優勢也、英國之稈序、乃自衛的、且能隨時勢之需要而增减之</p>
<p>並未放棄限制軍備之希望、渠並不以為擴張加速、今已臻最後之必要、但大局今甚可慮、政府對於國家與帝國全部充分之保護一事、决不稍事懈怠、空軍預算規定至一九三八年杪、皇家空軍共增加四支隊半、並規定第一道綫實力共有飛機一千三百三十架、另有無定規隊中之飛機一百二十架、内國防軍將增十一新支隊、共成五十四支隊、其中四十一支隊　常備役務、餘爲輔助或特別後備、海軍艦隊之空軍、將增第一道綫之飛機十一架、此項新組織將令英國空軍之實力述艦隊之飛機在內、共增至一百零半支隊、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）英相麥唐納今日在下院略述英政府對於天空襲　之衛計劃、謂政府不以僅賴還攻以保護天空爲滿足、數月前曾組織科學專家委員會、以調査用最新發明方法抵制天空襲擊之可能性、該會已緒具具體提案、現已着手作初步試騐、政府决定指派天空防務特委會、以統一海軍方面與民事方面關於天空防禦之工作、此特委會將作全部調査、並籌給爲研究所必要之經費云、（十九日路透電）</p>

<p>（柏林）今日午後有新成立之空軍之戰鬭機三十六架、轟炸機十五架、在本城天空舉行第一次操演、居民皆伸首而觀、殊感與趣、某時諸機密集飛行、掠屋面而過、衆殊爲之惴惴、空軍總司令飛行將軍戈林特命該隊來此、其志顯在示民衆以空中戰爭之可畏、同時外長牛賴特語路透訪員、謂德國今所措施、皆爲平等所必要者、而元首希特勒復曾宣布决不用此新陸軍與空軍以事侵略、故安全之一般情感、應使成爲事實、牛氏又曰、歐洲若再興大戰、則歐洲將爲告終、英外相西門來此後之討論、固非易易、但目下根據已較前鮮明云、（十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）柏林今夜十時至夜半成爲黑暗世界、蓋其時軍民實習大規模空防操演也、十時正、各商店窗一切燈光盡行息滅、而各家室各咖啡館酒飯館及工廠將黑布罩窗、致無一綫光亮洩漏於外、十一時正、大部份街燈亦行息滅、所留一千五百街燈亦於上面以厚黑布籠罩、祇留圓光一小圈於下、於是全城漆黑如死城矣、而今日午後、卽有驅逐機一隊計二十四架、及轟炸機若干翱翔於上空、意在以今夜之演習先行告知柏林居民準備云、（十九日國民電）</p>
<p>（柏林）昨晚舉行防空演習、假定敵國空軍係於十一時轟炸京城、乃令全城居民屆時一律施行火管制、並頒布防禦辦法、分派人員駐守各處房屋、監視實行、此項演習、業於午夜圓滿結束、居民執行命令、至爲滿意、（二十日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>英國對德抗議文之透視</h3>
<p>— 緯</p>
<p>自最近德國宣言設立空軍與實行强迫軍役制以後歐洲各國中之驚惶者不獨一法國然法國其尤甚者耳戰後十五年來法於外交上所視爲左右手者厥惟英國故羅加拿公約英國與焉巴黎公約英國與焉洛桑恊定英國與焉倫敦協定英國與焉倫敦協定英法擬定以「一般軍事措置」代替凡爾賽和約第五部分軍事條欵由法予德以軍備平等權利英則從中調和以使德國復返日內瓦共商軍縮此在法國已屬甚大之讓步但在德仍以爲未足故倫敦協定墨瀋猶新而德國竟以宣布設立空軍重整軍備聞矣</p>
<p>德國擴張軍備法爲顧全其自身之安全不能不有積極的對策英則以有倫敦協定在前自亦不能置身事外今後英國將本其信守揚法以抑德乎抑毁其宿諾揚德以抑法乎兩者必居其一今由英國對德抗議內容觀之英國之態度似乎尚難捉摸始則曰「德國政府於宣布空軍後復有最近之宣言於原則之爭點外且大足增加歐洲之不靖」繼則日·「英國對一般軍事措置代替凡爾賽和約第五部分軍事條欵曾在日內瓦聚精會神以謀斯舉之成功」由其前言觀之似贊助以往法國之立塲而由其後者言之則又似贊助今日德國之舉措有前老之非難不應有後者之贊助有後者之贊助則不應有前者之非難以英國外交之圓滑不致矛盾至此其中必有深意存焉蓋由歐洲國際關係言之法國惟德是懼而英人惟俄是懼於德則無所懼也法恐德復仇俄恐德侵略法俄兩國之對象爲一故兩國有結合之可能然德有東侵俄境之野心英有防止俄國煽動其殖民地叛變之國策其對象亦相同英德之結合亦非不可能之事也英外相當此德國宣布重整軍備之日柏林之遊仍不中止其目的與其謂在「增進普遍之諒解」不如謂其意在拉攏德國以組成反俄集團也</p>
<p>如上述之分析不遠於事實則今後歐洲軍事外交之分野甚爲明顯爲防衛德國之復仇與東侵法俄自成一大集團而小協約爲之羽翼爲欲整軍經武發揚軍國主義阻止赤色勢力之擴大德英亦可形成一集團而波蘭日本爲之羽翼今日軍事同盟之外交正與一九一四年大戰前夕之情况相類似孰謂今日歐洲國際和平之局勢不亟亟可危耶</p>

<h3>墨索里尼　東方政策下雨大組織　（羅馬通信）</h3>
<p>意大利首相墨索里尼執政以來、已十有三年、於修明內政之餘、近復竭力謀國權之向外擴展、在歐洲方面、初爲同情德意志、共作修改凡爾賽和約之呼聲、繼又聯絡法蘭西、獲得斐洲方面部份主權、緃橫　闔、竭其能事、近年來又對東方亞洲方面、顯然採取「懷柔政策」、其目的如何、固非吾人所可得知、而在此政策下、吾國顯爲對象之一、則於其組織活動、自不能不加以相當注意、茲一述羅馬新成立之兩大東方機關、</p>
<p>（一）東方研究院</p>
<p>東方研究院（Istitrto　Italiano　Per　il　Medio　ed　Estremo　Oriente）爲意大利研究東方問題之學術團體設於羅馬蒙賽拉禱路六十一號、會長爲現任上議院議員秦抵萊、秦抵萊氏頗稱富有、對東方研究事極爲熱心、該院係與第一次東方學生會同時開幕、現已一年餘矣（關於東方學生會開幕情形、詳去年之申報月刋）院中組織、除院長外有副院長及秘書等、加入該院者多爲有相當政治或社會地位之人物、月對東方問題較有興趣者、該院對遠東尤爲注重、院中設立中文研究班及日文研究班、分聘敎師、在同一敎室授課、惟時間有所不同耳、院中又有參考資料室、記老曾往參觀見搜集中日書籍及報紙材料不少、所剪報紙皆以卡片分類各室中皆置書橱、內藏來方問題之出版物頗多、</p>
<p>墨索里尼曾在該院作公開演講一次、類此之公開演講、平均每週都有一次、本月十二日由意大利前任駐華公使華萊演講「中國新文化之曙光」、蒞會聽講者頗衆、我駐意大使劉文島亦在座、雖其言詞、容對中國情形有曲解處、（彼駐中國時爲一九二八年、所言亦多爲數年前之情形）、然態度公正、對中國甚表同情、並推崇新生活運動、本月十八日特請神父部利阿演講孫中山先生之生平及對中華民族之影響、</p>
<p>該院又出版有關東方問題之書籍多種、均以意大利文字印刷、在該院及各書店發售、每次演講之後、多將演詞送列羅馬及各地報紙、</p>
<p>（二）東方學生會</p>
<p>東方學生會Confedration　of　Oriented　Strdents成立亦已一年餘、曾開大會二次、第一次在前年十二月、墨索里尼亦親臨參加、我國旅歐洲各國之學生蒞羅馬者達百餘人、連其他東方各國旅歐學生共約六百人、可謂盛極一時、開會後卽正式成立東方學生會、並議决設立永久機關於羅馬、</p>
<p>第二次係去年十二月廿七至卅一日、到會者、有我國留德奧意學生代表、印度鍚蘭留歐學生會、暹羅留法比荷德學生、阿拉伯留瑞法學生、埃及留德法學生、日本留瑞學生、爪哇留德學生等代表、約一百五十人、會中决議起草新糾織法、將東方學生會之内容加以修改、以前該會全係個人會員所組成、新組總法則改爲學生團體之聯盟性質、並决定會中分「全體大會「理事會」「常務理事會」三個組織、其後選舉職員時、曾有一度風波、因日本代表旅瑞學生OGHISSIMA、與波斯代表旅德學生Hossein　Danesch勾結、運動破壞該會、先主張以上任會長聯任本屆會長、因Danesch卽係第一任會長也、但其計盡爲大多數人所反對、於是全體代表會遂决議對前任會長表示不信任、以一百二十票對十六票通過另選會長、Danesh乃退出大會、埃及代表Galal前任副會長、亦隨之辭職、會中置之不顧、推選我國代表廖家寳爲會長、印度代表Sundaram,B.Litt及阿拉伯代表、Chekil　elDjabri爲副會長、暹羅安南錫蘭及我國代表各一人爲名譽書記及會計等、又常務理事會四人則爲印度代表Saxker與Dubash及阿拉伯代表Salem、我國代表林傑生、選舉未完畢前、埃及代表忽又表示撤冋辭職之意、但以事旣公佈、故會中不再加以考慮、</p>
<p>是以在第二次大會中、我國可謂相當勝利、日代表陰謀之失收、尤足以使東方學生會之基礎趨於穩固、今年一月十六、該會曾通告各方、聲明該會宗旨在「謀東方各國任歐學生之文化及一般利益」、並愼重表示「會中　舉及討論等均係學生自由意志、並非受有外界勢力之影響、同時歡迎東方各國旅歐學生多與援助、使可成爲完全獨立性質之文化團體、」態度光月磊落、無可指摘、惟不知事實是否能如所言耳、該會出版物有「新亞細亞」（NewAsia）一種、會址設於Via　Del　Cobservatorio一號、（二月十八日）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （沙永采）（顏鑫泉）</p>
<p>南大校長張伯苓先生，和他夫人王淑貞女士在南開禮堂舉行結婚四十周年紀念禮時的演說：有『做妻子的每每盼望自己的丈夫發財，殊不知發了財第一個看不順眼的就是你。『夫婦和好的責任，男人要占六成五至七成，女人只占三成至三成五。』『雙方都須降低身價，能忍能讓，不忌說謊，那就是和美的好方法。』等語，妙語解頤，極含至理。單這幾句話，已可抵得一部御妻術或御夫術了。</p>
<p>天虛我生最近在報上登了一則對於投贈書函者七字一句的聲明，雖然意味幽默，可是我們不能把它作爲幽默文字看。今特轉錄於後：『國人應當用國貨，此語人人皆認可，我雖不能强別人，但人亦不能强我，我對來函或刊物，用洋紙者尤痛惡，往往原封置高閣，或棄字簏投之火，其中文宇實未見，郵寄掛號必不誤，亦非懶慢不答復，辜負盛意職是故。』</p>
<h3>續怪姓錄</h3>
<p>— 公民言</p>
<p>三月七日的本刊，椀君的怪姓錄，所列的姓氏，大半都是些名人，知道的自然很多。可是我還知道幾個，是椀君沒會提到，也是一般人認爲奇怪的姓的。至於百家姓上有沒有？因爲我沒讀過它，祇好不管了。現在寫出。算是續貂吧。（公）這是我的姓。我流浪南北二十年，很少遇見同宗。四五年前，在江西當過師長的公秉藩，據說是從河南遷到陝西的，確是一個本家。以外在廣州的戲單上，常見有公××的，但不知道是不是姓？（母）一十年前，在北平關中會館訪一個同學。當時他一見我，就喊着「老母老母」！「快來快來」！「現在我給你找到了一個公的」。一會這位母先生進來就哈哈大笑。說「有趣的很。有一次我到郵局去寄信，等着掛號的人很多。其中有個靑年衝着我不住的笑。我簡直莫名其妙。後來看到他的信封，這纔恍然了。原來他寫着（父）緘，而我寫的是母緘呢。這我才知道父也是姓呵。」（雲）是我祖母娘家的姓。（鎖）存德是我的表叔公。他在淸末坐過陝西靈谷的巡檢。（句）章保民八九陝西郭堅的部將。人稱狗司令。（延）芝蘭是樊鍾秀部下的師長。（弓）富魁（績）西峰都是陝西靖國軍時代的司令。都是山西人。（鐵）我在西安時，有個麵坊掌櫃姓鐵。聽說他是回教徒（滑）鍊石是河南鞏縣的有名紳士。（山）水濱是河南的商人。現住東新橘豫順公。其餘像在聯華和陳燕：羅朋合演「寒江落雁」的（貂）斑華。律師（酈）鰲奎。鉛球健將（逸）明。不都是很少見的姓嗎？</p>
<h3>湖上新訊</h3>
<p>— 適園主人</p>
<p>歲序如流，西子湖上，桃蕊方綻，新柳已綠，山黛如畫，漸入佳境，六橋三竺，又是一番景色，行見蜂蝶遊履，如潮而來矣。</p>
<p>湖上遊艇，近來漸見進步，往昔銅欄式古懂之坐椅，去年以來，已均易爲二座式或三座式靠椅，木棉枕墊，罩以木耳邊白套，安坐其上，或俯或仰，中流容與，已覺安舒勝常，今春更有進一步之改良，頗有積極佈置沙發式坐位，每船四席，罩以奶油色椅套，近日已見一二，出現湖濱，逆料必將爲劃一時代之改進，雖近歐化，然人坐其上，畢竟心神為之更適。</p>
<p>寶俶塔改建後，六和塔亦將拆造，圖樣早田建築師繪竣，與原來形狀不稍更變，並將於塔下四周布置成園，以便遊塔之後，更得稍舒足力，計誠良得。微聞將仍由市府主持，欵項經由各界聞人助足，不久之間，卽將脫胎換骨，明年新春，或能以新色相與吾人相見，亦未可知。　　杭州近就建設廳內附設名勝導遊局一所，將來蒞斯士者，得赴該局請派識途之馬，從容遨遊，不致如檔吹沒眼之笛，吃煞「黃瓜兒」也。又聞該局近正招攷導遊员，積极从事训练，以供应應云。</p>
<p>湖濱六公園間，前有「陳英士紀念塔」，「北伐陣亡將士紀念塔」最近更落成有「八十八師淞滬戰役陣亡將士紀念塔」，矗立湖濱，極爲雄壯，足爲迷戀於溫柔鄉中之西湖遊客，下一貼興奮劑也。</p>
<h3>處世的謎</h3>
<p>— 紫微</p>
<p>偶然同一個朋友談話，談到了某甲的際遇，在不到一年的功夫，居然連陞了三級，這機關的待遇，不可謂不厚，可是，在同一地位，同一職務的某乙，到現在還是依然故我，非但沒有晋級希望，而且在本身的職務上，還有些搖搖欲動呢，</p>
<p>據朋友告訴我，乙的學問比較甲要高深得多，平時在公事上也非常努力，不過有些爾爲爾我爲我的脾氣，所以他們的主任和他有些合不來，至於甲呢，恃才傲物，目空一切，但對于他的頂頭上司，却卑躬屈節，色笑相承，偶和旁人閑話，一提到他們的主任，必力爭主任之德之才，在在高上一等，雖人家嗤之以鼻，而甲則行若無事，大有笑罵由人之概。</p>
<p>一年的結束期到了，當局者垂詢主任，考績勤怠，而主任力保某甲日，甲慎于公，敏于事，爲濟輩冠，乙則日高于頂，處事因循，餘子碌碌，不足道矣，當局者頷之。</p>
<p>閱日，公報揭曉，甲果榮膺機要，而乙則大加斥責，留職以觀後效。</p>
<p>事後，朋友把這伴事同他老翁談及，翁竟大贊某甲之善於處世，我友不服日，憑主任之一語，其間榮枯立見，然當局者固未尚詳察過一回呢，翁日，汝誠笨伯，處今之世，尚欲以眞本領爲瞰飯地耶，莫怪汝之老死牖下，不爲世用了，友尚斤斤强辯，餘怒猶未息，乃據以告愚，欲作一持平之論斷，余唯唯曰，甲固登龍之有術，翁乃老于世故者，講到處世的一種謎，豈是你我所能打得破的呢。</p>
<p>閨秀畫訊　今年女子書盡展覽會巳在積極籌備中，請陳小翠女士主編輯盡刊，內容選刊女子書畫詩詞散文，微求本會會員作品外，並歡迎女界投稿，三月十三號截止，稿寄上海靜安寺安樂坊五十九號可也。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>憑是太后爲養蠶而置的設備這樣的考究，育蠶的那些女孩子們也是格外的小心，但每一天工夫，總不免要有好幾十倏蠶——約佔千分之二三——因爲種種的櫞故而死去的。不遇我們雖發現了死蠶，却絕對的不許說「一條蠶死了」，只能默默地把它拈出來的。不但如此，養蠶的迷信的習慣還多着咧！無論什麼人都不准指着某一條蠶說「不好」，或「難看」，或其他的不好的話；如其這樣說了，那末這些蠶到後來所吐出來的絲，必然也要「不好」或「難看」了。而在這些專門育蠶的女孩子的頭上，且還各用一條很闊的緞帶紮着。使伊們的頭髮，一些不會散亂出來，據說這是給蠶兒看樣的；它們看了之後，所吐的絲也就一些不會散亂了。這些女孩子的腰間，另外還拴着一條顏色很鮮艷的帶子，把伊們的腰部束得很細，據說這也是給蠶兒看樣的；它們看了，所結的　子便能一般也是中間特細而兩端粗圓，樣子非常好看了。這些女孩子們在蠶室裏面，不但不能說不好的話，而且還得像教育一個小孩子一般的時時向那些蠶兒說幾句恭維的或激厲的話，那末到最後收成的時候，才可以得到很精美的蠶絲。</p>
<p>蠶兒本身的顏色雖然一般都是灰白的，但它們所吐的絲，却有純白色和金黃色之分，而以金黃色的爲更可貴一些。（二七三）</p>
<p>拉雜話</p>
<h3>阮玲玉自殺的面面觀</h3>
<p>— 定明</p>
<p>上海是東方的小巴黎，是建築在地獄上的天堂；從三月八日國際婦女節之後，新聞界的論壇，都集中揮發點在電影明星阮玲玉的自殺對象上，益形顯露。</p>
<p>關於阮玲玉的臭皮囊（佛學家語）放在萬國殯儀館，大演其迴光返照的「新女性」的時候，也就有每個看報紙的在伊軀殼前或盡報上，大投其視線：有了人心大變的不同看法，也就有大變人心的不同說法。我們不妨分析分析，向各方面照射個X光。</p>
<p>放在資本主義封建社會人的頑固心目中，定會搖頭擺腦，痛駡伊「好馬不披雙鞍，好女不嫁二夫」；死有餘辜。</p>
<p>放在普羅列塔利亞的眼角，會嘴一歪，鼻哼！「呸，軟弱的東西」！</p>
<p>放在影迷的嘴角邊，會摸摸腦瓜杓兒，淚落兩腮，大爲影壇前途悲哀；或捶胸搗肚，大灑同情之淚。</p>
<p>放在正深感戀愛痛苦者的腦袋裏，會感受兜頭一瓢冷水，　地清醒轉來。而三角戀愛者，將會自動解開它們的環扣。</p>
<p>放在電影藝人的心尖上，或者欷歔太息；或者以爲這是伊的一種錯覺；或者以爲這不管給三八國際婦女節奉贈了一顆燃燒彈；就是內心竊竊自喜阮玲玉死後，這地位將由伊（第二稱）替補的，也未嘗沒有！</p>
<p>放在電影圈的環象前，演員將會拒絕表演哀艷的劇本；戲院也將迎合一般人的心理，開映樂觀主義的片子。</p>
<p>放在阮玲玉生前的心坎裏，想必是芳魂自慰：內在的精神旣警告伊現實是醜惡，矛盾；外面的歹人又壓迫，襲擊，還是死了好！死了惹得人人笑，惱，流淚，嘆惜，憤怒，想像到許許多多男男女女在現出不同樣的臉色，正和看伊在銀幕上的表演一樣熱烈欣賞；那才眞正是登峯造極的電影藝術結晶品；笑艾霞遮遮掩掩沒有伊表演的妙。</p>
<p>放在心理學家的觀點上，想必理解到伊那七日夜赴友人筵後的醉態，狂吻，盡情的行所無事的跳舞，享樂；猛的在午夜撒了個烟慕彈後，視死如歸的寫遺書，多麼豪爽，多麼自然；純是一種哀艷演員的富於情感的神經敏感作用。這秘高歌當歡，狂笑當哭的姿態，也正是伊身世伶仃最後自慰與排遺的唯一心理。</p>
<p>然而，我極贊成某報評論家所說的：希望要情（？）死的人，把這種「殉訟」或其他殉情，殉節……的勇氣，換個方向，表現在婦運的革命行動上。</p>

<p>你怎麽不打扮得漂亮一點呢？</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>我們一來，就是住在這裏一家小旅館裏，雖聽到說有家小西天，可是我一不請客，二不會朋友，並沒有到這裏來過。自那姓連的去了半個多月之後，是他的朋友，自南京給我來了個明信片，說他已經到廣東去了，勸我不必在西安苦等了，早早的作回南的計劃。那時候，我得了這封信，又是害怕，又是生氣，哭了半天。那旅館裏掌櫃的，倒是個有良心的，他說：事情已到了這步田地，你要快快的想法子才對，胡亂的哭一場，能哭出什麼道理來嗎？我說到了西安來，舉目無親，呌我到什麼地方去想法子。就是那個姓連的，在西安認得幾個人，人家也同他沒有什麽關係，嫌他來得胃味。早就不理他。我並不是他的女人，不過是讓他騙了來的，人家更不會理我。那掌櫃的又說，我果然是他騙了來的，人家倒可以原諒我。說是他的女人，人家倒不帮忙了。我想想，這話大概也是真的，就把這件事情，實實在在的去對他的朋友說。而且也到各旅館去找東方來的人，好得一點機會。在那個時候起，我就到了小西天來了，也就在那個時候，我這人更跌下一步來了。在小西天遇到幾個同鄉，他們倒不怎樣拒絕，呌我陪了他們燒燒烟，打打牌，三塊兩塊的常常接濟我一點用費。幾個旅館裏，總是不斷的，有東方人來的，新同鄉介紹舊同鄉，我就借了這點機會，在同鄉裏面混着，混到了現在。人家都呌我一聲楊小姐，遮蓋面子。其實……他臉上慘傷着，那話又說不下去了。（一六二）</p>

<h3>標花有銀業套賣</h3>
<p>市價乃更難支持</p>
<p>棉市晨初、有一度堅挺趨高之勢、因美棉轉張、人心激動、詎料價格一高、銀行界乎中有押疑棉貨殊巨、目前　於世界棉市、一致參落、本埠棉價、尚未跌足、故今則大批套賣、市盤乃愈持矣、</p>
<p>鄭標不支</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、各月一致上騰、且漲氣甚烈、實緣美棉連朝慘落、今則回漲卅餘磅音、空頭激起祇補、而漲二三角、　料市盤高、銀行界放做押欵棉化甚旺、市塲現棉交易杜絕、且上日印美棉日廠購訂有二萬餘件、價格較華棉廉宜約有二元之譜、故拍至三收盤、大量的套出二三萬擔、市盤壓迫而下跌、結果近漲一角半、遠平、午後開盤賣風突熾、多聞銀行界將實貨套賣、人心尤驚、跌風大盛、五月期破三元關口、收盤時聞印棉暗盤漲六羅比、美棉仍有上漲消息、拍至遠期稍漲、午後結果近期跌二角至一角半、遠月未動、査賣出長和七千五百擔、益豐五千七百擔、大昶二千八百擔、泰昌二千一百擔、義成二千一百擔、慎記一千九百擔、永大二千三百擔、大豐一千三百擔、裕康三千擔、通記二萬五千擔、吉豐二千二百擔、大孚七千一百擔、穗隆四千八百擔、達記二千一百擔、森康二千四百擔、買進者信誠三千擔、大豐五千六百擔大、孚三千擔、合興三千五百擔、賡豐九千二百擔、元一三千八百擔、潤康六千五百擔、恒昌四千一百擔、新亨二千三百擔、源興昌四千擔、源大三千二百擔、生源二千八百擔、長豐二千四百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>糧食　期粉市靜中帶堅</h3>
<p>昨日粉市上午開盤後、各月份大致呈平穩之象、以洋麥報價、芝加哥好八分至一角零、坎拿大好四分至一角零、當開價時、各月份交易、依然淸寂、本月份因交割又近、出入不多、遠期各月份、則廠戶未出、人心稍定、兼之近日滙市略挺、拋戶又稀、故市面微呈穩固、迨至下午開盤、各月份市面、交易仍然不振、市况亦呈盤旋、與上午相差無幾、照目下情况而言、因雙方各有戒懼、投機帮難以用神、尚須平靜幾日、本月份不動、四五月份較好一分、六月份好半分、七月份好二釐半、八月份好半分、</p>
<h3>洋麥絡繹裝到　標準麥突見鬆落</h3>
<p>昨日期麥市面、上午以洋麥報價、芝加哥坎拿大好四八分垒一角零、當開價時、祇三四月份尚有交易、價則上落無幾、其餘月份則均未開、迨至下午開盤、各月份交易比較暢旺、價則突見鬆落、本月份因交割、多頭方面鑒於洋麥接續裝到、　碼步豐、故逐步脫乎、價遂不振、四月份亦因此故、賣戶亦占優勢、遠期則交易無多、上落甚小也、結果三四月份各跌四分、七月份跌一分、現麥見交尚暢、價呈定勢、開山東宿州麥三元六角三分、大利集潥河麥三元五角七分、六合麥三元五角、蚌埠臨淮關麥三元六角、由福新去四千包、信大去一千包云、</p>

<h3>米價連日下跌</h3>
<p>—紅續昨有東洋帮動辦—</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源仍祇二十餘號、（貨共近四千石）、其中尤以蘇同帮粳更稀、惟銷塲方面零躉兩胃俱滯、包胃僅烟台帮辦去百餘包、故大局市色迭見垂軟、其餘蘇同粳賴到貨不多而站定外、餘若靑角等帮薄稻、及南港帮早稻等價、續跌一角、杜洋尖乏貨無市、陰元則現平疲、</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路到船均十餘號、市上各貨交易寥落、市價白粳高貨小數分、中次貨平定、薄稻早稻零銷不爽、價短近角、其餘亦見軟勢、惟白元　挺緊、而客元銷胃雖不佳、價情站立、</p>
<p>（洋米）內地去化尚活、本街亦有應酬、故市面尚稱活潑、惟市上存底充實、到頭不絕、而小絞興長粒西貸存到較多、行囤多願貶價求脫、故昨日步落三五分、其他各擋均居平勢、西貢三月份昨開回籠貨四百噸、價乃降至四元二角半、比之上週巳步小二角以上、現洋米共開八千多包、客秈開五百五十包、多數由內地辦去云、</p>
<p>（黃豆）去路比上日略活、故市稍平穩、刻下大勢咸注意於餅銷之濃淡、計豆餅成交期現貨四萬餘片、廠方豆胃採辦車輪各豆五千餘包、</p>
<p>（紅續）日本去路復起、因見售價巳跌半元餘、故乘賤採辦、昨績去各糧二千餘包、行情續修六七分、</p>
<h3>麩價步步回小</h3>
<p>近日麩皮出口去化、久居沉寂、內地交易不多、而廠戶有洋麥到後出麩漸多、廠方雖尚擯持不出、而回籠貨回出者、多肯貶價脫乎、昨略有內地去化、售價已降至二元五角六分、</p>
<h3>糖市　粵粗白回升五分</h3>
<p>昨日糖市趨勢稍佳、粵粗砂白由糖業合作公司標售一批、高貨十六元七角半、成交四百五十二包、比升五分、色次者十六元半、無上落、成交三百七十包、公會劃盤二四粗砂白叫十六元七角半、未成交、轉口貸四元七角半、稍有畫出、太古糖B　十七元六角、無上落、本廠綿白振裕一號十六元一角半、二號十六元零五分、三號十五元九角、四號十五元七角半、號盤有潮帮開出靑糖一百數十包、黃崗靑爲十元、次之九元八角、隆港靑九元四角、比前微鬆、又開出枚洋白三百包之譜、較高者十二元八角、次之十二元四角至二三角、再次不上十二元、市象平、</p>

<h3>警旅籃球隊敗於暨南　暨南表演美妙以五七比卅九勝　警旅初來塲地不熟名將均減色</h3>
<p>武漢警旅籃球隊、爲籍北健將之混合集團、遠運代表劉振元尹鴻祥亦在其內、段焯王湛爲昔日北平之錦標選乎、葛克王健民鄭森等乃華中名將、前年遠運會吾國在上海預選時、均曾來滬一顯身乎、論人材個個出衆、此次由宋如海率領來滬、昨晚首次出塲對曁南在申園比賽、不竟表演失其常態、以三十九比五十七敗於曁南、全隊聯絡尚佳、但投籃不準、塲大招架不週、完全敗於生疏兩字、至於曁南之勝、確有其實在功夫、殊非倖致、</p>
<p>塲地生疏</p>
<p>競爭形勢、極緊張興奮、初曁南投籃一再失機、頗不如意、入後漸覺熟手、韓振元尹盡仁之角球、極有把握、警旅隊、初臨客地、塲地不熟備覺慌亂、守衛力集中於中路、不顧兩邊、被曁南乘隙龔進、分數扶搖直上、曾至二十三比三之大差、警旅屈居下風、後極力振作、上半時以十三比二十五落後、下半時警旅仍無起色·祇得平衡之局面、而無得勝之能力、曁南還擲甚準、攻守俱見精彩、警旅有相形見拙之槪、劉振兀退化甚多、尹鴻祥別來無恙、穩健如昔、</p>
<p>一籌莫展</p>
<p>開始後、曁南韓振兀罰球開紀錄後、即在籃下夫去一穩進之　、其爲可惜、徐亨罰球、加上分、相持未允、警旅葛克在籃下得劉振兀之巧傳、躍起投中一球、觀者精神爲之一振、蔡演雄亦爲曁南增上二分、斯時警旅王健民已登記三次犯規、即由名將尹鴻祥登塲、不料警旅竟一無起色、劉振元鬰鬰不得志、葛克被徐亨監視極嚴、無可奈伺、曁南左右游擊、運球工夫極妙、韓振元尹貴仁屢次射中邊球、聲勢大盛、警旅不能深人、對方監視極嚴、聯絡方面、似未得乎、竟一無建樹、造成二十三比三之懸殊局面、曁南遙領前導、</p>
<p>略見起色</p>
<p>警旅由鄭森入塲代替段焯、葛克投中第二球、成二十三比五、暨南略見軟化、光頭鄭森乎運忽來、又投兩球、均告中的、王湛若亦得一球、鄭森又加二分、成二十五比十三、頗有扶搖直上之勢、但上半時時間已至、休息再戰、形勢較前益爲激烈、警旅力謀打開僵局、曁南則不稍放鬆、各有建樹、局勢平衡、三十七比二十三、警旅仍差十二分、但以後暨南手勢又盛、華中健兒又陷於荒亂無序中、</p>
<p>局勢懸殊</p>
<p>曁南賴各人均有美妙之投籃、分數、逐漸高出、警旅僅由尹鴻祥投中一球、比數轉成四十五比一十五、相差有二十分之多、一無成就之劉振元、方始開其紀錄、此後比數、常差十八至二十分之間、徐亨一球、造成五十七比三十五、曁南勝利在握、韓蔡二人、相繼下塲、袖入預備員、警旅極力掙扎、段焯連中二球、成五十七比三十九之最後結果、裁判員周家　翟鴻仁、明晚警旅對東華比賽、</p>

<h3>國貨外銷之檢討</h3>
<p>— 仰莽</p>
<p>國貨在今年之命運，內困於農村之衰落，外迫於世界不景氣之普通、路徑愈走愈狹，此固無容諱言。顧國貨之新生，在南洋確爲惟一之出路，我國貨廠商，應聯合戰綫、以從事於國貨外銷的推行。推行上最大之困難，據南洋考察者歸來所談：則匯兌，運輸，保險等等，均權操他人，而押匯之重利，與稅則之受虧，相形見絀，在在落人之後，此則國貨界應趕快想法，以國結的力量，開拓此外銷之途徑，爲不可緩也。記者認爲上述問題以外，有最重要之一事，爲國貨界向所不注意，而久已失却南洋華商之信仰老，厥爲貨品之不知選擇。一般販賣商任意以粗製濫造之貨品，販運南洋，以國貨爲號召。彼僑商初以一片熱忱·而所購者反爲次貨，不但短氣，且以灰心，是眞國貨之敵。故鄙意今後我國貨廠商，應由同業聯合公組檢騐機關，廣羅專家，出其技術，凡出口之貨品，必經嚴格之檢騐，與精細之審査，以挽回旣失之信用、開拓未來之新路。此事極爲重要，似不應專賴政府，視爲具文，或用意甚善，而所任非人，轉爲利藪。張公權先生謂：「提倡國貨一事，今後要大家來賣力，而且都要自己出馬去做。」確爲我國貨界所應注意者也。</p>
<h3>國貨運動到家庭去</h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>國貨在現在的時代，我以爲唯一的路，就是用經濟的方法，奏最效的結果！經濟的方法是什麼呢，，——國貨運動到家庭去！</p>
<p>三四年前，我到鄉鎭去，時常看見婦女們打草帽，做他們的副業，假便，這種方法用在製造國貨方面，那麼這收效是很大的。因爲，普通國貨工廠在未製造貨物之前，一定要造鋼骨水泥的廠屋，要聘許多辦事職員，這些費用，如果解除，只有國貨運動到家庭裏去一個方法！</p>
<p>有一個留學日本的朋友告訴我！日本輕工業爲什麼這樣發達，因爲牠們成本輕，成本何以輕呢，政府的保護，當然是一個主要原因，但是，家庭工廠的發達，却是最大原因。</p>
<p>那末有些讀者們要疑惑了，現在是機器世界，假使施行家庭工業這方法，恐怕手工業要復興起來，這不是開倒車嗎？</p>
<p>我以爲家庭工廠並不是只用手工的，用機器也可以的，不過，那是要二三戶人家合作起來才行，况且，我所說的是小工業，講到規模大的，那就非設立工廠不可啦！但是大的資本，是靠國家經營的。我下個比喻；在國貨和洋貨抗爭裏，大工業好比是大砲，重機關槍，小工業好比是步槍，手溜彈，在現在中國不景氣的時侯，望多多地加多步槍和手溜彈，我們且擇便利的做！家庭工廠的組織，就是這個意思！</p>
<p>我看見有一本婦女雜誌，談到中國婦女的沒落。資產階級的婦女，麻醉在歌榭舞毫中，中產階級的婦女，躱在家裏賭錢作樂，而還有許多徬徨在歧途中的娜拉，做着花瓶式的女職員。婦女難道眞是沒落了嗎？快從滅亡的途中走回來，走着家庭工廠的路！</p>
<p>今年是學生國貨年，我希望教育界鄭重地提倡起來，勸導「家庭工廠」這件重大的工作！</p>
<h3>集團結婚與推銷國貨</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>上海市第一屆新生活集團結婚典禮，將於四月三日下午三時，在上海市政府大禮堂舉行，有五十八對靑年男女，在儉約目標下，結成夫婦，這：眞是一件破天荒而空前的盛舉！同時，我國著名的美亞綢廠，利用這千載一時的大好機會，爲一般新郎新娘，特織男女綢禮服式樣，計男禮服袍褂料甲種十五元，乙種十二兀，女禮服料甲種五元六角，乙種四元五角，兜紗每襲租金一元五角，以察核價目，尚屬低廉，又爲提倡國產絲綢起見，業經社會局核准照辦了我想不單是男女禮服，可以趁這機會，得到極大的功效！其餘如三友社的合歡枕，毛巾，月經帶，孩兒圍涎，以及男子中山裝，小花園的女鞋，家庭工業社的蝶霜等……在可以廣告半價，推銷給集圑結婚裏的靑年男女，無異一面共同提倡集團結婚，一面有效的提倡國貨减少入超，杜寒白銀外流，薄利推銷國貨愈迅速！國貨給男女靑年的印象愈深商家何樂而不爲？</p>
<h3>國貨界應該注意的件事</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>談到提倡國貨運動，　認爲消費者田然應該出其最大的努力來服用國貨，購買國貨。然血，在另一方面看來，國貨的生產界，也應該抓住機會，利用　　，替國貨生產品立下一個使國人永永信仰的心理的基礎，這樣雙管齊下，消費者與生產者，切切實實的合作起來，那末，我們中國的國貨運動，自然會得到很好的成績，達到成功的地步，這是一定的道理，我想：大家都該十分明瞭吧！</p>
<p>可是，說來眞是不幸得很，年來的國貨運動，經了全國上下一致的鼓吹和宣傳以後，生產者和消費者，似乎已經覺悟得多了，然而，照我看來，國貨生產界，還有二件應該注意的事，應該切實的來注意一下，（消費者應謀注意的事，不在本文討論範圍之內，不多述。）因爲這是和整個的國貨運動的前途，是有莫大的影響的，茲寫述於下，以與國貨生產界相商榷！</p>
<p>（一）同業間應取消廉價競爭的政策—同業與同業之間，本來是應該聯合起來的，怎樣研究推銷的方法？如何厘定貨物的價格！這是應該與同業於事先商討的。可是，目下的國貨生產界的情况，是怎樣呢？唉！除了廉價競爭，同業傾軋以外，還有什麼話可說呢？這是一個很嚴重的危機，某實業家說：「廉價競爭，是國貨事業的死症。」眞是慨乎言之！我很希望同業興同業之間，快快的覺悟起來，來組織同業組，或是同業公會，聯合營業所，來補救這個缺點，如火柴業已組織有聯合會，搪瓷業也有聯合營業所，最近鋼精業和調味品業，也有了同業組，和聯合營業所的成立，這是一個很好的現象，可以免除同業間之傾軋，和廉價競爭的發生，我想：國貨生產界的其他各業，實在也有急起注意的必要。</p>
<p>（二）生產品應絕對的避免粗製濫造要國貨生產品得到消費者的信仰，第一應該使貨品靠得住，所謂靠得住，便是絕對的毫無粗製濫造的成分，夾雜在裏面，這也是一件很要緊的事，關於貨物的推銷前途，實至重且大，我國國貨生產界，現大部份已能注意於此，然而，尚有若干生產者，仍不免有粗製濫造之情事發生，這是很應該注意的）伴事，不但對於消費者的心理方面，大有關係。同時，也可以使同業之間，得到不良的影饗，擴大的講，對於祭個的國貨運動，實有重大的關係，當此國貨運動，正在蓬蓬勃勃之際，作者很希望國貨生產界來切實的注意一下。</p>
<p>上述二者，我認爲在目下國貨生產界所應積極注意的事，爰假國貨週刋的地位，以與生產界相研究焉。</p>
<p>參觀記</p>
<h3>昆明釀造廠調查記</h3>
<p>— 寄雨</p>
<p>打開歷史，中國人在於工業上有着光榮的一頁，絲茶瓷器等在從前都佔世界上最高的地位，我們可以承認，中國人是聰明的，是動苦的，這聰明和勤苦可以開闢一條有希望工業的路，只要摒除了守舊的一種惡習。</p>
<p>在這守舊的惡習還長得很茂盛的時代，要看到一個澈底改革而求進步的工廠，實在是並不容易，但是現在我居然看到一個昆明釀造廠了。</p>
<p>昆明釀造廠設在昆明路，佔地很大，現在他們暫時只出產醬油。這次去參觀的共有五個人，是憑了朋友的介紹的。</p>
<p>隨着門房踏進了會客室，接着，一位姓毛的先生來招待我們，我們在會客室裏坐了一會，就在毛先生指導之下參觀各處。</p>
<p>我們最先到的地方是化騐室，那邊在適當的溫度下，在各種器具裏培養着許多種類的酵母菌，毛先生和我們說：「造醬油酵母菌很重要，這種菌好像和工人一般，替我們造最重要且人所不能造的一步工作，糟坊裏造醬油並不在許多酵母菌的種類裏擇其最好的來利用，只是將原料曝在空氣中，讓任何一種菌類來祖任製造的職務，所以出品不能够進步。我們這間房子，除化騐製出來的醬油外，找尋那一種菌類最好，是一種重要的工作。</p>
<p>其次，毛先生引我們到發酵的地方，那是一連串狹長的屋子，溫度很高，兩邊都擱木盤的木架子，木盤裏放的都是正在發酵的原料，——豆，發酵時是要放出二氧化碳的氣體的，而那邊又因爲爲便利發酵起見，只留着兩只通氣的洞，所以我們不多時候就出來了，再到了一間很大的屋子。</p>
<p>這間屋子是特別的，裏面都是用水泥做成的大方槽，槽與槽之間，留了走人的路，屋子的一角，有一只槽空着，於是毛先生指着對我們說：「在發酵得完成以後，利用比重而得鹹的程度的鹽湯，就先放在這槽裏，接着再放下去這發酵過的豆，槽裏面有一根管子，這管子是通水蒸氣的，水蒸氣有攝氏表一百度的熱，足够比普通太陽的溫度高，所以我們製醬油，不需要像糟坊裏一樣的曝在太陽裏晒，除了蒼蠅灰塵不會混在醬油裏而得到衛生的條件外，在夜裏，我們仍可利用水蒸氣通在這管裏，使得出品迅速。」</p>
<p>走出了這間屋子，轉了灣，我們看見一具碩大的水壓機，利用水壓機可以比舊式的壓榨機壓出更多的醬油，他們的成本也因此低了，據毛先生說，現在他們的醬油除銷本埠外，外埠像漢口等等都有很好的銷路，在將來，他們還要造酒。</p>
<p>當我們走出昆明釀造廠的時候，我心裏不住的想：中國人是聰明的，能勤苦的，這聰明和勤苦，可以開闢一倏有希望工業的路，只要摒除了守舊的一種惡習。</p>
<h3>國貨史料</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>夏問所用之電風扇，以前均係　來品，自華生電器廠之電風扇製成後，因其效用，較舶來品有過之無不及，而價值則低廉多矣。故國人咸　用國貨，每年挽回　權不少。該廠之創辦人楊濟川氏，向未研究電學而入學校，所有電學知識，均憑其天才而得，結果反較留學生優良，足微我國工業技術，並不後人，惜無人提倡　。爰將乃兄楊雨展前日錄示其丁卯十月，爲濟川先生新發明電氣風冒，而所赠之五言律詩並序於本刊，以爲國貨界增光。</p>
<p>弟幼年在家、　未研究西學，後往上海貿易，自購得電學須知一本，聊學鍍金，藉以遊戲而已，不料由此豁然大悟，於雷學一事，觸類旁通，而西文算學，亦無待師傳，自然了解，遂在上海虹口創辦電器廠一所，名曰華生。非但於電學一事，多所發明，卽各種機器精微，亦明如觀火，非但外國工程師自歡不如，卽外洋留學生凡相識者，亦時時具函請教。從前電燈廠常被人偸電，旣無從査考，又無法制止，後來弟發明一種限制表，乃能革除比弊，現今各電燈廠均利賴之。近又發明一種風扇，較舶來品旣省電，而力加强，價值又减，以故各省暢銷，應給不暇，以外發明者甚多，均收效果，生而知之歟？學而知之歟？非余之所能决矣。詩曰：「機心渾不用，學古得全功，此道須天付，何人與子同，持觴遙問月，批席自生風，多少新聞見，清川思不窮。」</p>
<h3>介紹無錫的元草地毯</h3>
<p>— 緑濱</p>
<p>就經濟的立塲說，當着目前中國農村破產，都市衰落：百業凋凋，不景氣的現象，迷漫着我們的周　。提倡購用國貨，發展國家生產，民族資本，實是當前的急務，經濟復興的要策，也是挽救危機的大舉。可是，一般國貨，雖是出自國內工廠，而原料却多半仍須向外商採購。因而還要經過一層剝削、價格上還不免要較爲昂貴。正當購買力薄弱時的國民，依然有點兒爲難。自然最好是採用本國原料，製造純粹的道地的國貨相宜了。</p>
<p>無錫江蘇省立教育學院的農場，鑒於我國農村經濟頹萎，應該急謀拯救，除一面對於農作物的本身，設法改良種子，改良種作方法以外，並提倡農村副業，如農村工藝，也是重要的一部門。同時訓練學生此種技藝，同時在各民衆教育實騐區，直接教學與一般民衆，成績頗著。但所有原料，皆是國貨，卽是避免重重剝削。且成本可以减輕，銷售容易普遍、如元草地毯一種，製造得異常精緻，花色很多，舖設廳堂客室，皆十分雅觀。（見圖）笜者日昨特至該院訪問該院農村工藝教員郭義泉先生，承蒙見告情形如左：</p>
<p>「本院農塲農村工藝傳習所，與北夏民衆教育實騐區，合設的農村工藝傳習所，教導農家民衆婦女，利用農閒，精製各式磚形地毯。原料係採用蘇州滸墅關元草，完全是道地國貨。不論中式廳堂，或者西式客室，要拿這種地毯做點綴，不僅美觀，而且耐久經用。至於尺寸大小，可以隨買主的意思照辦。現在高喊農村復興的時候，我們的這種工作，也許是有益的吧」！</p>
<p>郭先生和我談話時，並隨卽取過已經做好的元草地毯給我看，有各種各樣的花紋，兀草的染色，紅，藍，綠，黃，各色皆有。聞每英方尺，定價祇售一角八分，較之洋貨氈毛地毯，不知要便宜若干倍了！</p>
<p>聽說無錫平民習藝所，也製成這種元草地毯，市間採用者很多，特在這裏一併介紹，希望愛國諸君，提倡國貨諸君，能夠多多購用，豈不是可以稍補國家經濟於萬一嗎？</p>

<p>自由談</p>
<h3>談傻幹</h3>
<p>— 江寄萍</p>
<p>在都德著的磨房文札中，我看見了許多很好的散文。有一篇「高尼葉師傅的秘密」，形容一個磨麥粉的師傅的個性的剛毅，及不屈不撓的樣子，很可以表現出西洋人傻幹的精神。他說法國在工業不發達的時候，那時汽機還沒有發明出來，許多磨房裏都用風力來磨麥粉，所以如果是勤苦的人，都可以得到豐衣美食。那地方每逢星期日，磨房的主人都是很快樂的把香酒拿出來請客，主婦也妝飾得很漂亮的，戴着黃金的十字架，大家吹着笛子跳舞。可是後來有巴黎人到那地方去創設了一所汽機麵粉廠”一來工價便宜，二來磨麵也快，所以大家都把麥子送了去磨，這一來把藉風力磨麥的磨房的買賣搶了不少，於是大家都不能維持了，相繼的都關了門，有的去做別的生意，有的便潦倒不堪了。磨房的主人再也拿不出香酒來請客，主婦們再也沒有閒暇的時間來修飾。這個很熱閙的地方，一時變爲異常的凄凉。在這些倒閉的磨房之中，唯有一家還開着門，牠的風輸依然在天空中盤旋着，這便是高尼葉師傅的磨房。這不是一日了，大家都懷疑着誰家的麥子拿來給他磨呢？可是高尼葉很勤苦的，每天都趕着驢子馱着兩口袋麥子，送到他自己的磨却不讓人進去，卽或是他不在磨房的時候，也把門關得牢牢的，像怕人偷走了他一粒麥子。不想忽然有一天，他磨房的門忘了餓了，有幾個孩子進去一看，那裏有什麼麥子。原書描寫這些小孩子初進磨房的神情很好。說：「怪事！磨子間裏竟是空空如也，一只口袋都沒有，一顆麥子都沒有；墻壁上和蛛絲上也都沒有一些粉屑，就是平常磨房裏輾碎麥粒的這一股熱香也聞不到，磨床上滿佈的是灰塵、那隻大瘦貓魷睡在上面，魷是內問也同樣的有這種廢棄與窮的神氣：——破床一只，破衣數襲，階石上有麵包一片，一只墻角裏有三四只破口袋，口袋裏漏出些石灰屑與粉土來。」高尼葉的秘密便被發現了。原來他的驢子壓着的是石灰。孩子們把這秘密傳遍了村中，那個年老的磨麵粉師，便坐在他的磨房裏哭起來，原來他這樣的吃苦來幹這事，是爲磨房爭些光榮的。大家被他的誠心威動了，都送麥子來給他磨。以後這磨房便繼績的維持下去，直到高尼葉死後，那磨房的風輸才停止的。在我們看來他作的這種事是近於瘋狂的，或是因爲激刺過深而得的一種精神病，其實這是一種很堅强的意志，一種反抗的精神。西洋許多的科學家，事業家，都是因爲有這種傻精神而成功的。這不是矯情，不是愚拙，而是堅强的努力。中國人遇着失敗，便認爲全盤沒有希望，把全部都犧牲，一生便這樣萎頓下去。遇到人家這樣傻幹，還加以嘲笑，所以永遠沒有成功。這篇文章像是笑談，然而眞啟發我們不少。</p>
<h3>瘴氣的谷</h3>
<p>— 吳巖</p>
<p>只不過舊曆的二月吧了，但谷裏的天氣，却熱悶得怕人，彷彿巳經到了三伏天似的。</p>
<p>路邊的茅草，又粗又硬，不小心的時候，簡直會把足腿刺痛。</p>
<p>蒼蠅雖不會吃人，但見牠猛然撲到臉上的時候，就會害怕地覺得像要來咬掉臉上的肉一樣。</p>
<p>我那時正以漂泊旅行爲主要的娛樂的時候，走到這樣的地方，當然，便特別感到興趣了，打算放緩了足步，用好奇的眼睛，搜紫洽一些不曾看見過的東西。然而，我的前一天在山路上碰着的旅伴，一位自稱是生意人可沒有貨物的可疑的傢伙，却現出害怕的樣子來了，回轉頭來皺攏兩道濃眉，催促我道：</p>
<p>「走快一點！走快一點！…你曉得這裏是什麼地方呵！」</p>
<p>「自然，我曉得。……那是一樹什麼花呀？……不要管，人家還會搶你我麼？」</p>
<p>我早就猜着，在這山陡谷險的地方，强盜爺爺是難免沒有一點兒的，兩手空空的流浪者，用得上什麼担憂呢，只顧向近處一根三四丈高都全是紅花的樹子發獃。</p>
<p>「鬼花哩！……我告訴你，不是說那些搶人的，小夥子！」</p>
<p>他將逡到腰幹上的包袱，朝背上拉了一拉，走了好幾步，才帶訓斥一般的口氣，回答我，語調上好像是個老頭子那麼似的，但人其實不過三十來歲吧了。我就不免有點不高與，仍舊慢慢地走，眼珠子朝路旁隨意地溜着，到說不說似的說道：</p>
<p>「那，……有什麼可怕的呢？……你怕天黑趕不到店子麼？」</p>
<p>「哼，你沒有聽見人家說麼？這個谷裏是有瘴氣的。……快點，快點，一到天黑就要出來的。……」</p>
<p>「呵！」</p>
<p>他聽見我吃驚了，便有勁地說着，宛如要使我更加佩服他那老有經騐的話語似的。</p>
<p>「人家說這個谷裏的瘴氣，是一個蛤蟆精放出來的，懂得麼？蛤蟆精。下雨天，趕馬人就看見過，你猜，喂，等一等，你猜，那是一個什麼樣子呀？」</p>
<p>他竟然停着足步來考問我來了。</p>
<p>「快走吧！那不還是一個難看的大蛤蟆？……你就忘記瘴氣了麼？」</p>
<p>我對他用手揮一揮，好像在趕他朝前趕路似的。</p>
<p>他的足立刻本能地加快走了起來，但嘴巴却仍興奮地說着。</p>
<p>「大蛤蟆？不！一個着紅衣的漂亮姑娘呀！站在黃果樹的根上，把一頭黑頭髮，梳呀梳地，媽媽的，够迷人哩！……」</p>
<p>「我們今晚上不好看看她麼？這樣迷人的東西！」</p>
<p>不大相信這類的事情，便說出和他打趣的話來。</p>
<p>「嗯，你怕不要命了！……會看見她的人，哪裏還活得出來呢？」</p>
<p>「怎麼？她吃人麼？」</p>
<p>「她哪裏高興吃你囉！你還沒有挨近她，就被她吐出來的瘴氣毒住了哪！」</p>
<p>「那末，你又怎麼曉得她是穿紅衣的女子哩？」</p>
<p>「嗨，我不是告訴過你是別人告訴的哪？」</p>
<p>「怎麼！他還活着呢？不是說看見了就會死了麼？」</p>
<p>「哈，你怎麼這樣笨？他也是聽來的呵！」</p>
<p>我不愛把遊戲的問話再繼續下去了，因爲人類本來是長於說謊而且又是長於相信謊話的，姑且默默地就承認是笨了吧。</p>
<p>「還有，潞江壩的瘴氣就不同了。」</p>
<p>他躬下腰幹去理理足上鬆弛了的草鞋絆結，當伸起來的時候，便開始了這一句話，但不說下去，彷彿要等我催問：「那又是怎樣的呢？」可是，我不開腔，只顧埋頭趕我的路。</p>
<p>「我告訴你，那是江裏面的一條黑魚精……」</p>
<p>他終於再說下去。我心裏却想道：「謝謝，我沒有請你告訴我！」他一面講話一面走，不知不覺地就慢了起來，有時候，如果不是我叫他快走的話，便會停在路上讓嘴巴子單獨活動了。</p>
<p>谷裏四週的山都很高，到半，下午的時候，太陽魷老早不見了，祇是留着使人難於忍受的悶熱。我們都解開紐扣，敞出胸膛來，把蒸濕表衫的汗氣放去。我怕今晚趕不到山上去投宿，會留在谷裏過露天的夜，讓瘴氣來磨折，便屢屢回頭催促他：</p>
<p>「要黑了，走快一點，到那邊店裏去講不好麼？」</p>
<p>「好的，好的。」（未完）</p>
<h3>東方文化學院參觀記（下）</h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>最初我們所看看的是三樓的古物陳列室。</p>
<p>走進這問房子，完全像走進北平故宮博物院一般。有中國古代各朝時代的古錢·古裝·古瓦瑤·古盡·古害·古劍·古磗·……一切應有盡有，被他們依着中國古本而複製的書陳列在這里的有文選·史肥·禮記·毛詩·孔子家語，……等，在許多畫册裏面，我發現了一本題爲滿洲國立奉天博物館紀念出版的畫冊，立刻全身的血液都沸騰起來，像受到了莫大的侮辱似的，再也無心翻下去了。</p>
<p>從這里出來，就參觀藏警室。</p>
<p>這是一所有七層的藏書樓，面積每一層樓雖只有二十舖席那麼大，可是裏面的裝置太奇怪了！書架全是鋼的，樓梯樓板，四邊的璧全是鐵的據說其所以這樣建築者，完全爲了防火的緣故。</p>
<p>因爲研究所成立還只有一年，所以裏面藏的書並不怎樣多，許多書架上都是空着的，那位先生告訴我們現在所藏的書，全部只有七萬本，中國的佔了一半，剛剛有三萬五千本。</p>
<p>本來上書樓可以乘電梯的，因爲要參觀，所以只好爲難兩條腿子。各人的腳步和鐵的樓梯接觸時，發出鋼琴一般的響聲，有趣極了，大家都靜靜地傾聽着這有節律的音樂，而忘記了上樓的疲倦。</p>
<p>每到一樓，都有一個二十多歲的靑年坐在那裏寫書簽，或者整理書籍，看到我們總是站起來微笑着向我們行禮。日本人的研究精神眞令人欽佩，有些爛得沒有字的古書，經他們複製一下，全體成了新的，他們用一律的封面裝訂，看起來非常整齊面獎觀。</p>
<p>畫庫參觀完了我們又被引進了古書　製事務室和攝影室，攝影機是用的日本最新式的，像顯微鏡一樣，能够由小到一顆灰塵似的東西放大，到若干尺，因此複製古書就非常方便了。</p>
<p>以後又參觀了會議室，共同研究室，講演室等等。在共同研究室裏看到了國內各大學的定期刊物以及九通，二十四史，中國各省地圖等，那位先生又告訴我們說有位中國的巴象寅先生在教他們的中文，每星期有兩小時。</p>
<p>據說這里的研究員，也有一定的限制，不是博士，是沒有資格來研究的，理事長是服部宇之吉，連理事及事務所，圖書室，攝影部的職員通通共四十餘人，各人的薪水至低每月一百一，最高三百元，研究的題目各人不同，從什麼時候研究開始，至什麼時候終止也都規定好了的。他們目前正在研究的是：楚辭文學研究，中國古代北方民族物質的文化，遼金時代的研究，儒家治道的研究，左傳研究，中世紀中國貨幣的史的研究，及魏晋南北朝時代思想史研究等。</p>
<p>京都和東京的研究所，每年出東方學報一冊，其內容大半是研究員的心得報告。</p>
<p>在歸途中，大家都不說話，低着頭，踏着小小的石子靜靜地走着，我想各人的腦海裏也許裝了比小石子還多的感想，但有一個應該是共同的吧？</p>
<p>「爲什麼中國的文化通通到了他們的書庫裏了呢？」</p>
<h3>人與書</h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>金魚</p>
<p>因爲孩子們歡喜金魚，自己對於這一方面也就似乎感到了一點興味。但孩子們並不懂得養金魚的方法，而自己，又是自晨至夜，走動得迄無休止的，因此金魚到了我家，不是把「活」的養成「死」的，就是把「朱」色養成「白」色，這已經是不止一回了。此外也還有一種危險，就是孩子之一，非常的歡喜解剖生物，對金魚當然是不願輕輕放過，常常地，乘着堂前沒有人的時候，把活的金魚偷偷地從缸裏取出，拿到門外地上，獨自一個用小刀慢慢地解部。無論你怎樣的說服他，總是沒有效果，從去年起，我們便不再養金魚了，雖然每當看到金魚担子，或經過金魚攤頭的時侯，依奮要動一動念。不久以前，在一家舊書店裏，看到一部康熙年間的稿本，題作「朱魚經」，是一個研究了三十年金魚生活的蘇州人做的，把金魚分作五十六大類，逐類的加以很科學的說明，並寫了許多養金魚和收子等等的方法。由於過去對金魚的一段因緣，加以此書並無刻本，索價又祇四毛小洋，便把它買下了、。後來，振鐸先生南來，看到了這部稿本，他也說未見過刻本，並從改動處證明是原稿，我便格外的感到興味了。</p>

<p>但那靠收租榖過活的阿源的母親却用鼻尖來跟你應酬，簡直不睬。這把我的母親氣得發抖了。魷自暴自棄地，埋怨地，把我在當塲胡亂地拉扯着，弄得我痛得叫喚起來，哭着。可是，阿源的母親也不來勸阻。</p>
<p>我獨自遊玩的時候多起來了。並且，時常總是想：「爺爺回來了就一定會變成有錢的人吧。　除非跟姐姐她們一道，不然，就是採莓子，捉蝸牛，（把蝸牛炙來吃，味道是很不錯的），或採竹實等等，我也是一個人去的。</p>
<p>父親儘都不回來。漸漸地有着凱旋歸來的人了了，但，姑丈和父親還是沒有回來。</p>
<p>這時候，我有了一個戀人。</p>
<p>離開了男孩子羣的我，跟姐姐一塊兒和女孩子遊玩起來了。</p>
<p>那個女孩子名字叫做惠美。在我家對面的高高的石牆上，有一間連着土庫的巨大的瓦房子，那家人在村裏算是舊家當中的大財主，惠美就是他們的獨生的，頂小的女兒。她是個性情執拗的孩子，但却有着老成的要强的地方。我還記得，那時候她是八歲，要比我大一歲。</p>
<p>七歲的小孩子，當不致於有什麼性慾：但，我却頗爲淸晰地意識着戀情。不用說，惠美似乎也是那個樣子。兩個人不時躱着男孩子羣和女孩子羣遊玩。</p>
<p>有一次，給男孩子羣找到了。我們兩個人在惠美家裏的擱米糠的小房子裏玩着。發見了我們的男孩子羣，不曉得在什麼時候，就把小房子的四面包圍起來了。</p>
<p>「嘩，嘩，嘩……」</p>
<p>那些淘氣的小鬼頭都嘩啦嘩啦地嘲罵着我們。</p>
<p>我覺得很爲難，縮做一團。於是，惠美就把抱着的洋囡囡丟開，跑到門邊去。，她回馬了些什麼話，一會見就將躺在內廳的「熊」叫了來，嗾使它去咬他們。巨大的獅子狗，那被稱做「熊」的，是一條老雌狗，牠在主人的命令之下，就尖銳地吠了起來，弄得那些頂刮刮的淘氣貨都一腳不停地逃走了。</p>
<p>兩個人大約要好了一年的樣子；但，在種種事情上開始分辨出　常的區別時，就自然地疎遠起來了。</p>
<p>那也是由我這方面先覺得胆怯。惠美雖然在別的種種事情上面很是老成；但她却不曉得我是「吃剩飯的」，和惱重運輸卒乃是　腳的兵士等等。</p>
<p>而且，惠美也不曉得我不喜歡在她家裏的樓上遊玩的理由。原來從那裏朝下一望，就可以看到我的四聞連房的草屋頂——那歪斜的，用蓆子蓋住漏雨的塲所的草屋頂。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>北平三角變愛慘殺案</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>現代中國靑年因戀愛而發生糾紛的事情，委實是書不勝書。沒有給人發覺的，當然無從知悉。每日由報紙披露出來者，已經是數不信丁。這嚴重性，在男女戀愛問題上，是很值得注意的。</p>
<p>近日北平又發生了一椿三角戀愛慘投案，情節非常重头。從各方面看，這不能不說是社會上一件不幸的事實。慘案兇手劉景桂係北平北華美術專門學校學生，現年二十四歲，宣化人。於民國二十一年，與體育家透明（亦宣化人，現年三十四歲，上海交通大學畢業）發生戀愛，訂立婚約。旋　於華北運動會中，結識滕爽（湖南昭陽人，現年二十九歲，北平女師大畢業）。逐於二十二年春間，與劉解除婚約，而與滕結婚。劉由是銜恨刺骨，今番乃殺滕以洩憤。</p>
<p>我們將此慘案的始末，略加研究，卽覺得此慘案發生的罪答，實集中於逯明一人，蓋　本爲一有妻室之男子，今竟先後又與二女子發生戀愛，且俱訂立婚約，其視戀愛與婚約爲兒戲，事實甚爲明顯。　旣不願與前妻偕老，而再戀愛劉景桂，則與前妻離婚，與劉結婚，一切便得到解决了。無奈遠生性喜新厭舊，復又不顧與劉訂有婚約，而再與滕爽發生愛情，且從而進行結婚。故劉心有不甘，乃懷復仇之念，遂决然出而殺滕以解宿恨。是則此慘案之造成，　實不能辭其主貝。</p>
<p>至若劉景桂的行爲，亦未免過於偏激。蓋逮旣與劉訂立婚約，復又與滕結婚，則劉之被遺棄，罪在　而不在滕，此理明甚。今劉竟下此毒手，將滕殺害，其錯誤的行爲，實亦不能恕。且　自與滕發生戀愛，已存心棄劉，故與劉相議解除婚約。當時倘劉不願意解除婚約，儘可依法與法極力交涉。然劉旣不如此做，而慨然允諾廢約了，則劉亦可以聽他們的自由，去自尋自已的出路。這樣也就無事了。誰知劉竟餘情未斷，懷恨遠勝至深，終且决心實行殺滕，以出胸中之怨氣。此劉之故意殺人罪，亦屬應得矣。</p>
<p>值得我們同情的，是滕爽一人。她因戀愛糾紛，而致犧牲於情敵之手，實在很寃枉。不過滕先前對於與遠發生戀愛，不能謹慎從事，亦不無若干過失。此或卽她今日喪生的禍源乎。</p>
<h3>或女私記</h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>反覆地想了一個深夜，神經是像給一種尖銳的，頑固的鐵杵在擣着那樣的，動亂得激烈的時候，心便像受了「逹姆達姆」彈一般的粉碎了。整個的夜晚，在鷄的啼，時鐘的搭搭聲中，我思索着又思索着；於是，一種最後的堅决驅使了我：天一亮，我决定走了。</p>
<p>不走做什麼呢？在這一種腐爛的社會層中間，當作爲人類解放的主要工具之經濟基礎還是落在男子的單方的時代，女人底玩弄與悔辱的命運是終於難免的；但，不可忍的侮辱與玩弄，對於具有特種靈感的人類，却是一種最猛烈的精神上的毒害劑啊。</p>
<p>難道說，當時代發展到二十世紀的尖端，當人類正在誘耀他們自已底文化的時期，却也有人把玩弄在不合理的社會中長成起來而失掉了經濟能力的女性這一件寨看作是合理的，快意的，賞心悅目的嗎？</p>
<p>眞呌人三畫夜都想不透的，這是一個什麼時代呢？究竟是什麼時代呢？文明的嗎，殘酷的麼，還是卑微得難以登錄到史書的一頁上去的，見不得人的怪異的時代呢？</p>
<p>這古怪的時代的謎底是祇有鬼知道的！</p>
<p>然而，不管怎樣，總之是受不了人類所不能受的侮辱。</p>
<p>（也許是因爲識了幾個字：也許是因爲最容易犯罪的靑春期的壓迫吧？當在腐敗與頑固的氛圍中脫離了所謂「家」的舊殼，便一點也沒有考慮的機會，就那麼地給推到社會的狂濤中來了。</p>
<p>迎着來的是人與人間的嘈弄，侮辱，與作爲人類的本能之一的飢餓的襲擊。</p>
<p>於是有關心的朋友對我說了！</p>
<p>—在這個社會裏，一個女子要想擺脫了玩弄的恥辱而去找一兩片麵包來嚼是不可能的；女子頂容易餓死，然而女子却又頂不容易餓死—像你，你年紀靑着哩，就憑着你這靑色的笑朶兒，已經可以換到奢華的享樂而有餘了，何必定要那麼苦苦地在騙人的「自立」的口號下面受着飢餓的苦痛呢？傻！</p>
<p>但，自家兒是年靑的，有着一顆熱的，愛淸潔，愛光明的心哩。對於生活的支配是有勇氣的。便在少年的熱忱下面駁斥了，朋友的話，而且用懦弱與卑微來罵倒了。</p>
<p>世界難道眞是那樣的麼？誰相信呢。</p>
<p>然而，不信也由你，事實終於漸漸地展開了。幾個目的流浪，侮辱，與飢餓的經歷呌我害怕，終於，在自暴自棄的精神中像無數的弱女子那樣地，把結婚當做了療飢的職業，把自己的靑春的笑，靈魂與身體整批地賣出去換取一個腐爛了的心靈與生命之延續了。</p>
<p>開始給抓在別人手裏的時候，也許是給好意（？）地玩弄着的：但後來，因爲人家有錢，人家是有着「大少爺」的心情的：於是，在不快意的時候，有動亂的時侯，在煩悶的時侯，在一切不遮宜於扮得嬌媚的時候，便開始給像對待奴隸那樣的辱罵起來了。</p>
<p>—賤貨！賤東西！</p>
<p>而譬如說昨天，爲了笑得不能迎合人家的愛好，竟打了我一個耳括子！）</p>
<p>而這　耳括子，也許會結束我的生命，但也許會帮助我開始一個新的生命的呢？</p>
<p>自殺吧？何必呢？自殺在黃金的「公子」下面是比任何卑微的行動更恥辱的。於是，想了一夜，决定天一亮，我就走了。</p>
<p>可是：走到那裏去呢？</p>
<p>天不知什麼時候才會亮？</p>
<h3>過鎭江</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>坐火車過隧道，這次算是第二次。第一次是在廣九車上，隧道長度和竇蓋山的差不多。當火車哄隆轟　的向洞口邁進的時候，汝伸出腦袋向前望去，火車就變成一條吐着黑氣的溜着的蛇，</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>着矯勁的姿勢，迅疾的向洞口鑽。這時，汝的神經末稍，會有一種奇異的感覺襲了上來，像從光明的天地，突然懸空墜陷下無底的深淵，身子四肢失了憑籍那麼的。假使車廂裏也有小孩，那汝還可看到他們拍手歡呼的天眞稚態。一會，光明復見了，不由汝不翻過頭去向後望，這時火車無變了一條出洞的蛇了。</p>
<p>當火車鑽出寶蓋山的隧道，汝就會曉得鎭江到了。在先，汝望見焦山，再次，聳豎雲空的金山上的塔就牽住了汝的視綫。這時，汝若是一個帶點詩人氣質的人，又曉得一點白娘娘和許仙的故事，就不由汝不撩起無限的　懷，遙遙的望着那支塔出神。汝會緬懷，想像，那神秘的白娘娘與法海禪師鬥法逞能的又悲又壯又艷的戰景。</p>
<p>當火車在汽笛聲中又開始向前移行的時候，汝只得用一個蘊含無限同情，惋惜，憑弔的目語，遙遙的與金山作別。</p>
<p>人類的性靈，到底非殘酷無情的禮教所能毒害凈盡的呢。汝想，白蛇故事能够流播人間，爲人樂聽，抓住無數人的同情心，感動多少曠男怨女的涙水，這不就是人類的性靈沒有完全給殘酷的禮教毒害凈盡的表露麼？</p>
<p>這一篇悲艷的白蛇傳，是蘊含着多少女性的涙水啊。這不是神話，也不是虛構的小說，這是血漬鮮艷的愛與禮教鬥爭的現實的悲劇。自蛇娘娘更不是蛇，不是妖，她是有血有肉有靈魂的人，是至神至上的完全的女性。那個道貌岸然的法海禪師，纔是吃人不貶眼的人妖呢。</p>
<p>不過，禮教的惡勢力究竟太大了，牠的門禁到底森嚴難撼；白娘娘的一切努力，掙扎，抗鬥，都完全化成泡影，結果還是一敗塗地，雷峯塔下的鎮壓，宣告了至神至上的女性的愛的死刑！而這旦古的悲劇，亘古的人性中的缺憾，就貝落得血漬鮮艷的留爲人間同情，惋惜，感傷的故事了。</p>
<h3>柘榴嫂子</h3>
<h3>情感塑成的人</h3>
<p>— 縱心</p>
<p>還是迷茫，但渾身感到輕鬆多了。逃亡的人呵！</p>
<p>走到西貢岸臨邊，頓覺四週是浩曠得令人身軀有些搖幌；好像剛才是從牢獄逃出來的呢！站在高巍龐大的法郵船下，仰望上去，心神更加歡躍飛奔，不禁深深的吐口長氣。有點餘驚的對着那可怕的陰影微抖。</p>
<p>天上的白雲無邊際的萬里千里，我好像輕飄飄的就將馳到那浩奔的，所憧憬着的遠方去！壯膽的登上法郵去。望着幽長的伸展前去的西貢港的九十九灣，那碧綠的港水，那兩旁碧綠的靑草，那熱帶風的輕鬆的姿色，心陣陣躍動。</p>
<p>但回過頭去向西貢市內看去，胸懷又有些戰慄難耐的，夾着悽愴的酸味。腦內重閃着哥哥那聲淚俱下的神容：</p>
<p>「還說什麼？還說什麼？我白費半生的勞苦。」</p>
<p>哥哥辛苦的造成我，但我却是一番兩次的坐牢。哥哥怎樣肯放弟弟，獨自飄泊到渺茫的遠方去！可是，弟弟却絕不安於這死沉的，醉生夢死的商人生活，而要去冐險的追求所謂自由！哥哥終不理解，徒去尋死呵！</p>
<p>幾天來哥哥是連飯都吃不下，弟弟爲什麼一定要走呢！而弟弟的目光，也萎縮得述望望哥哥的身上也不敢。唉，情感塑成的人性！自己是止不住悲顫，又湧盪若火般的熱力，難堪的交戰，使自己的喉嚨也咽不下飯。</p>
<p>靠着船沿，想得眼前發昏了，一陣陣的暗陰黑霧，閃幌着。西貢市好像籠着像霧般的涙珠子，像凄風苦雨的秋夜般慘惻悲哀。耳邊老是嗚咽的抖着哥哥那哭聲，那哀慟的神容……</p>
<p>目光盡深爬入西貢市內去，莫名其妙的虛渺的目光！</p>
<p>忽然，遠遠走來一個彩子熟識的人，我急揉着迷亂的眼睛，制北卜的跳着的心；但直到他走近我的面前，我還是呆住着。他沒有呌我，只是從口袋裏拿出一捲鈔票給我後說：</p>
<p>「大舅交給我，呌我拿來給你的，大舅呌你到香港後，回汕頭要坐官艙，路上小心。」望一望我就像要走了。</p>
<p>我不知爲什麼，竟全昏了。渾身發抖，兩臂酸得難舉，瞠目無語。眼眶內的酸淚在急湧。有一縣知覺在告訴我：哥哥如果再呌我回去，我那能說不回去嗎？我這樣决絕的走了，哥哥還始終這樣疼愛我呀！我的週身像是沉在溫柔鄉中，浸透了我冰冷的骨頭的情感呵！這時候的哥哥，竟是我鐵般堅的意志的主人了！雖然我終於是走了意志的偉力把我救走了！但情戚的魔力是到了我走後，又把我一度壓服了！是情感塑成的人喲！</p>

<h3>達理爾桑納克所述題材選擇的方法</h3>
<p>— 金雀</p>
<p>題材是影片最重要的問題。影片製造家最要緊的工作，就是尋覓適當的題材。</p>
<p>這似乎是老生常談，但是這句話却從美國影片製作界的首腦，像二十世紀公司製作部主任達理爾桑納克（Darryl　F.　Zanuck）口中道出，那就足以使人注意了。據桑納克的談話，人的情感，如喜怒哀樂之類，是終古不變的，所以無論在古希臘蘇復可爾斯的時代，或是莎士比亞時代，戲劇中的原動力的恐怖希望等等，在古代所能發人悲哀或歡欣的成分，今日還是可以發人悲哀或歡欣的。所以要為銀幕發掘新的故事，新鮮動人的故事，就是在尋覓一個新的題材，而將情感的成分加以配置編排而已。銀幕是這樣，舞台或小說，亦莫不是如此也。</p>
<p>以事實而論，劇意的故事編排建築的技巧，凡是成名的著作家，都是此中的斲輪老手，但是電影的製作家，却不僅在能將一段故事加以顛倒穿插的編排。在這裏，更重要的一個問題，就是「時間與口味」的問題。一位雜誌的編輯，桑納克說，「儘可以在七月中開始編訂十二月發行的雜誌。他可以在封面上畫一個雪景，裏面放些冬季的讀物。那是既簡單而又沒危險的。但是在電影的製作方面，却沒有這樣容易。我們能選擇什麼題材，預料在六個月之後，可以適合觀眾們的脾胃的？」</p>
<p>「你想做大眾口味的指導，是沒有法子的。你想在這影戲事業中領袖人，那是夢想。因為大眾是不肯受任何人領導的。但是如果你跟着大眾後面跑，那是再危險沒有的了。在一個潮流之中，祇有第一張影片是可以成功的。其餘的倣造品，祇好似矮子跟在長人後面看戲。但是怎樣預測未來的潮流，觀眾思想的潮流，却又是一椿最重要最煩雜的問題了。</p>
<p>怎樣預測未來的潮流，怎樣搶那第一個大浪，而趁著它進攻？這是不是領導大眾的思想，而是在大眾需要某種東西的某一時期，你有現成的貨色交出來而已。攝製影片的勝利，如同打棒球的勝利一樣的。兩件活動的東西，一定要在空間的某一點，某一時相遇。在棒球場上，那兩件東西是球和球棒；但是影業中，那兩件東西是題材和大眾胃口。無論那一方面說，如果你運用得太遲了，太早了，太寬泛了，或是散漫無力了，你就錯過了機會而失敗了。</p>
<p>「預測大眾的胃口，你用什麼作根據呢？」有人問桑納克。</p>
<p>桑納克說：「我用新聞紙。我每天翻閱全國的報紙。在兩年之前，我於讀報之餘，我覺得美國的觀眾，漸漸厭倦於盜匪了。在那時以前，美國的觀眾却會欽佩過盜匪的。他們欽佩那種義俠的行為，抑強扶弱的行徑。但是他們不久已經覺到盜匪的橫行不法，實在是社會之大害。因此我就開始構了一張“Public　Enemy”（公敵），第一次將這些盜賊的兇殘卑污，盡情暴露了出來。果然這張片子一出，大眾趨之若騖了。又如“The　House　of　Rothschild”，更在一年之前所攝製那張片子，完全是不可能的。但是後來我覺得美國的人民，對於銀行家在國際外交上的活動，已經發生了極大的興趣，於是就決定了攝製那張片子。果然那張片子攝成之後，又博得大眾熱烈的歡迎。」</p>
<p>有人問他：「將來的電影，是否將攝取莎士比亞的戲劇，或將舞台上的歌劇搬上銀幕呢？」</p>
<p>桑納克的回答是：觀眾胃口的水準，是永遠在逐漸增高之中的，所以將來電影的採取莎翁本，當然也是十分可能的。那不過是時間問題，一般人喜歡高深的戲劇，沉醉在裏面，而不盡是在表　自己的身份。至於歌劇的搬上銀幕，那更是一大進步，不僅在佈景移置的便利上，更是因為歌劇者的喉嚨，但求其清朗正確，而不必一定要響徹雲霄也。這樣，就是說銀幕上的歌劇歌者可以比歌劇場中的歌者體態苗條些，而不必都是腰圍十丈的碩歸也。</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「女子陶朱」</h3>
<p>Mills　of　The　Gods</p>
<p>——大光明</p>
<p>作為反應美國經濟恐慌的的「女子陶朱」，從各方面說來，不是沒有價值的影片。自然我們不會忽視，這是反應羅斯福的復興政策的，而且是最積極的通過了電影藝術支持着羅斯福的政治主張。正因為如此，於是憂傷者不能不接觸到世界經濟恐慌對於美國產業之影響，他以圖表來說明，美國產業在戰後相對穩定期內，其繁榮的指數在一九二九年達到最高點，可是從經濟恐慌開始之後，便立刻急速的慘落下來，甚至於瀕於破產的，大工廠也不能不拉上鐵門。因此工人們的罷工，暴動，再也不能遏止，不能不感覺極大的悲痛，因而羅斯福上台之後，無辦法之中的辦法——復興政策便應運而去了。</p>
<p>然而劇作者對於真實並不是一點不加曲解的，譬如他強調着資產者生活的糜爛，劇中人老歸曼麗的兒孫，都是那樣惡勞好逸，對於自己的產業，不聞不問。我們並不否認資產者的糜爛生活，不過這決不能作為他們產業失敗的主要原因。同樣他使廠主小姐和工人領袖談愛情，這非現實的地方當然不能掩飾他欺騙的作用。就因為這些歪曲現實的結果，所以到後來他提出欺騙作用的結論：一方面同情工人們的行動，當廠長為了免得工廠再加虧耗而歇業的時候，工人們是包圍着工廠，幾乎暴動。同時他更極力維護廠主們的利益，譬如因為廠主小姐和工人領袖有過一夜情的恩情，所以工人領袖便設法緩和工潮。一直到不能緩和下去的時候，廠主是命令警察開槍的。最後他使廠主之子誤死於警察的機關槍之下，作為一種懲戒，（雖然他決不會使他死於工人之手，而是誤死於自己的武力之下。）而經營五十餘年的老廠主夫人，再拿出四百萬金，復興工廠，於是乎工人們非常感激，所謂勞資妥協，能力合作了。關於這一點，其政治的欺騙作用，至為明顯，可是我們檢討復興運動的結果，却並不怎樣有成績，正相反的使美國愈益不安。於是這一影片的說教作用，也就等於白費氣力了。</p>
<p>不過如上所述，這一影片在表現方法上，將共說教的作用，竟分的表現出來，無論編劇，演員，攝影各方面，都很勝任愈快，特別是導演的優秀，Roy　Wiiliam　Nell對於每一場戲，都處理得十分細膩周密。特別精細的是廠主小姐到工人領袖家去，當描寫她們之間愛與慾的時候，那種細膩的心裏描寫，確是超越一般庸俗導演的了。此外，當以指數表現生產之衰落的時候，他是利用着音響的效果，快速度組織許多面部特寫，這優越的手法，無論如何是電影藝術的表現。諸如此類，我們並不將這一影片估價過低，雖然它不免有着若干程度的社會欺騙作用存在。</p>
<p>「金蓮刧」中之一幕——瓊派克朁吉姆士鄧合演——今日南京映</p>
<h3>「美人心」前奏</h3>
<p>— 金文</p>
<p>日本帝國主義佔了我們的東北以來，已經有好幾年了。在「一二八」和「九一八」事件發生的時候，人們是曾經充滿了反帝的熱情，記得中國的電影也攝過幾部反帝的影片，但時至今日，民氣似乎一天一天地消沉下去，而日本帝國主義積極進攻我國的政策，依舊存在，最近察哈爾的專變，就是一個明證。</p>
<p>為了喚起民眾反帝的熱情，於是明星公司便攝製了一部以東北義勇軍為背景，反帝的影片「美人心」。該片由徐欣夫導演，胡蝶，王徴信，徐莘園，顧梅君，顧蘭君主演。故事描寫一　愛國戰士，怎樣從滿洲國的牢獄裏逃了出來，怎樣地在冰天雪地裏頑強地抵抗着日軍，這故事中的主人翁義勇軍的首領李鋒（王徴信），怎樣地在因苦的環境中戰退了日軍，而終於死在疆場上。其中穿插着一段羅曼史，悲壯熱烈，使人們看了，大有欲哭無淚，欲笑無聲之概。無疑的這是一部喚起民眾反帝熱情的影片。願讀者都來一看這傷心怵目的圖畫。（却）</p>
<h3>「風流寡婦」捲土重來</h3>
<p>— 北林</p>
<p>一九三四年至三五年期間的米高梅最大的全部浪漫歌舞鉅製「風流寡婦」（Merry　Widow），本來是一齣舞台的香艷浪漫劇，最近復由米高梅耗費了鉅資搬上銀幕。</p>
<p>這部影片的故事，是描寫麥沙維王國的最豪富的一位寡婦蘇呢，她非常的年青美麗，生性浪漫，且善歌善舞，和一個御前侍衛伯爵唐尼羅，也是一個善於交際的風流小夥子，湊到了一起，便發性了許多香艷的浪漫事。在故事間，如唐尼羅深夜踰牆跑到蘇尼面前夫自己介紹，以及後來他倆人因誤會而反目等畫面，都是非常的動人。但在其中最偉大的場面，却恐怕還應當算為音樂和歌舞了。有一支最美妙的歌曲Merry　Widow，據說現在國內外的青年們幾乎每個人都已會唱了。</p>
<p>導演人是我們誰都知道的劉另謙。至於主演人，希佛萊和麥唐納，那更是我們所熟知，用不着來介紹的。</p>
<p>「風流寡婦」數星期會在「南京」連映多日，現因多數觀眾的要求，已於昨日開始在「麗都」重映。</p>

<h3>印度亡國恨（Clive　ofI　ndia）（六）</h3>
<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>曼寗看着那一　化子兵開拔了，就歎了一口氣道：「這真瘋子幹的事」。堪德亦說道：「為真是瘋人隊」。潘勃頓道：「並且，你要問我的話，那管帶亦是一個瘋人」。總督畢各德在旁邊，却不以為然似的道：「幸虧……有這麼一個瘋人」。</p>
<p>幸運之神贊助了這亡命。過了幾個月之後，這小小的化子軍，或瘋人隊，竟成了大軍了。它所向披糜，當者無倖。最後，德里拿坡的圍亦解了。克萊夫已經成了一位長勝將軍，南印度的征服者，凱旋歸來的時候，大家都要刮目相看了。</p>
<p>聖大衛的砲轟中，總督衙門裏開着盛大的歡迎會。文武官員都到齊了，靜待着上賓的駕到。但是大家都疑惑起來，這上賓那裏去了。艾德蒙麥斯格林報告道：「我們回來的時候，他離開了大隊，祇帶了十個衛兵，要到一個鄰近地方，將一個法軍戰勝紀念碑打倒。他說那可以給印度人曉得英國的軍威的」。湯森少將聽了，連忙說道：「不差的，不差的，很有道理的。但是……這裏的歡迎會，他來不來呢……」艾德蒙連忙說道：「他說他要來的。他不會不來的。但是，我要請一回假，去接我的妹子來。她今天剛從英國到此」。少將連忙答應道：「快去，快去」。</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂正在和克拉克隊長談話。克拉克正在興高采烈的講論許多戰場上的故事。有一天，克萊夫頭上受了傷，但是他却一個人，將一隊法軍繳了械。「他喝着叫他們將槍械擲下來。他告訴他們已經被困在核心了。天是那麼黑，他們四周一些都看不見。因此他們很惶恐地，大家都將軍械擲在地下了。等到我們知道了，去協助他，他已經將一隊的俘虜排着隊開步走了。我們大家笑得幾幾乎要死」！他一面說，一面狂笑着。</p>
<p>艾德蒙走了上來說道：「預備好了嗎？我們走吧」。瑪格勒蒂忽然害怕起來道：「他……他……來了嗎」？艾德蒙道：「沒有。祇好讓他一個人直接到歡迎會去的了。你想奔馳了四十哩路，還像個什麼樣子。我本來想叫他在這裏會見了你，和你一同去的」。瑪格勒蒂忽然哭了起來道：「我…我…不要見那個人了」！艾德蒙奇怪道：「怎麼啦？凡是在印度的人，誰不想在今天見見勞伯特克萊夫呢」？</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂哀求道：「你不懂得我的意思嗎？我來到這個地方……不過想會見一個平庸的小辦事員……你的一個朋友。現在他是一個大人物了。他一定要心想，我是希望嫁給他的。」她說說，嗚嗚咽咽地哭起來了。艾德蒙笑道：「瑪格勒蒂，現在亦不能往後退了呀！如果勞伯特要見你的話，他一定要見你的。如果他要你嫁他的時候，他一定會告訴你的。你現在還沒有認識他哩」！</p>
<p>瑪格勒蒂道：「我要他知道，我一些希望都沒有」。她正說着，外面已經起了一陣擾動。不用說，克萊夫已經來了。瑪格勒蒂臉急得紅紅的。她的一顆芳心狂躍着，好似要跳出心腔了。她求着艾德蒙：「你告訴他，我已經先去了」！但是艾德蒙頭也不回，奔出去迎接克萊夫去了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Continuing Rise in the Water Level at the Guantai Breach; Closure Seems Unlikely</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The closure of the breach at Guantai on the Yellow River seems unlikely. The water level has continued to rise in recent days. The Hebei Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee sent a special telegram to Li Yizhi and Kong Xiangrong on the 20th, requesting that they quickly find a way to close the breach to prevent the main flow from overflowing northward and turning all counties in southern Hebei into a swamp.

<h3>The Business of the Huitong Transfer Bureau Has Improved Recently</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The first accounts of the domestic and foreign exchange have been settled by the Huitong Transfer Bureau. There are more remittances from outside the customs to inside the customs.

The business of the Huitong Transfer Bureau has improved recently and no longer relies on the authorities to allocate funds to maintain it. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The East Luocheng of Shanhaiguan was falsely designated as an administrative district, refusing postmen to deliver mail, so the local mail is sent by the false post office to the transfer bureau to transfer to our side. After unsuccessful negotiations, Huang Jiade, the Hebei Postal Director, plans to go east in the next few days to inspect postal affairs and investigate. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Border Demarcation Between Yunnan and Burma Cannot Proceed Recently</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Peitian of the Yunnan Provincial Government's Office in Nanjing said that British troops have been invading the Yunnan border not just today. Now they have invaded Mengjiao and Mengdong. The office has not yet received a telegram from the province, but has already sent a telegram to inquire. Once the reply arrives in Nanjing, the truth of the facts will be clear. Regarding the border demarcation between Yunnan and Burma, after the central government sent personnel to survey last year, it was reported that it was going smoothly. As the weather is gradually getting warmer, the miasma in the Ban Hong area is very strong, and mainland personnel cannot go there. The border demarcation must be carried out after autumn at the earliest. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>

(Central News Agency dispatch, 19th)</p>
<h3>Passengers at Yuguan Blocked; Resolution Found; Japanese and Puppet Authorities Issue Notice; Normal Passage to Resume Tomorrow; Unemployed Subject to Restrictions</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 19th, the Japanese and puppet authorities in Shanhaiguan announced that, except for Japanese and Korean people, Chinese people leaving the pass will be allowed to pass as usual from the 22nd, but they must have an occupation and proof. Public officials must have letters from their organizations, and workers must have tools or be able to prove that they have skills. The unemployed will not be allowed to leave the pass. All those leaving the pass must be investigated by the Japanese military police, and only after receiving a pass can they board the train. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Japanese troops and international police teams have set up checkpoints at Gubeikou, Xifengkou, and Malanyu to strictly crack down on Chinese leaving the country. Japanese troops are also stationed at the Saheqiao Bridge in Jianchangying. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beijing) The Japanese side is preventing our laborers from leaving the pass, aiming to sever the connection between the nationalities inside and outside the pass. At the same time, because there are many workers from inside the pass going outside the pass, the total amount of money earned in the northeast throughout the year and remitted to the interior through the post office is about 30 million or more. The Japanese do not want the money from outside the pass to flow into the interior. This is another reason to prevent Chinese workers from leaving the pass. Before the September 18th Incident, the number of Japanese and Korean immigrants in the northeast was no more than 200,000. After the September 18th Incident, although they forced immigration to the northeast, it was not very enthusiastic. The total number of immigrants in three years is still less than the number of our workers leaving the pass in one year. Our Chinese workers are hardworking and easy to develop, while the Japanese have a higher standard of living and are not easy to develop. The Japanese believe that our workers leaving the pass hinders their national immigration policy, so they decided to stop it. Our side has requested the Japanese side to postpone the implementation for one year, but the Japanese have not agreed. Yiwo, the head of the Kwantung Army's Yuguan Special Affairs Agency, also expressed his inability to help. According to investigations, most of the workers who have been blocked this time have property outside the pass. Because they returned to the interior to spend the New Year during the severe winter, they are now returning to the pass to continue their business in the warm spring. Unexpectedly, all of them were blocked. If they cannot pass, all their property outside the pass will be lost, estimated at about 3 million or more. The North China authorities have reported this situation to the central government and requested instructions. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<h3>Puppet Organization; Military Police Headquarters Abolished; Directly Responsible by Japanese Military Police</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) The puppet country's military police headquarters has been completely abolished, the military police disbanded, and the local areas are directly responsible by the Japanese military police. Each military police headquarters hires Chinese people to act as secret agents, paying them one yuan a day. Those who provide important reports and lead to arrests are heavily rewarded. Many traitors are engaged in this. This matter will be implemented on March 1st. (Dispatch, 20th)</p>

It is still undetermined whether the members in Beijing, Wu Heling, Bai Yunti, and Kexing'e, will go to the temple. (Central News Agency dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) A telegram from the Bai Ling Temple stated that Prince De, accompanied by his entourage, departed from the Bai Ling Temple on the 19th to inspect local conditions in Hatu Wulate Middle Banner Prince's Residence, Wuli Usu, Baiyan Mountain, and Dai Temple, and to visit various banner princes and consult with them. He will return to the temple within a week. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the issue of taxes in Mongolia and Suiyuan, since Zhou of the Chahar Provincial Government expressed no interest, Xiao Renyuan has repeatedly met with Bao Yueqing, the representative of Prince De, these days, urging him to telegraph Prince De to inquire about his opinions. Prince De has not yet sent a reply to Ping. Xiao will go to Suiyuan Temple in the short term to continue mediation. Shi Huayan, the representative of the Suiyuan Provincial Government in Ping, will accompany Xiao. (Special dispatch, 20th)</p>

<h3>England, France, and Italy Decide to Hold a Tripartite Conference, France Has Protested and Requested the League of Nations to Handle It, Laval and Eden Will Visit Moscow, Hitler Sends Special Envoy to London</h3>
<p>(London) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini today invited France, England, and Italy to hold a tripartite conference in Paris on Saturday. The European diplomatic and military circles were greatly encouraged by this news. This conference intends to correct the impression caused by Britain's unilateral action towards Germany. The British Cabinet held its second meeting this week at 11 a.m. this morning and it is said to have approved the tripartite conference. It was also learned from the Foreign Office today that Eden may fly to Paris on Friday or Saturday morning to attend the preparatory meeting. The choice of Paris as the meeting location is said to be at Britain's suggestion. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) Official sources have just announced that a second conference of England, France, and Italy will be held after the British Foreign Secretary Simon and the Lord Privy Seal Eden visit Berlin, Warsaw, and Moscow, after which the tripartite conference will be held. The location has not yet been decided, but observers believe it will be in Stresa, northern Italy. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Interior Minister Régnier told reporters today that the French government's note of protest to Germany was worded "very strongly." An official announcement stated that the French note, which is two pages long, will be submitted to German Foreign Minister Neurath by the French Ambassador this afternoon. Its content criticizes the political and legal aspects of Germany's conscription system, and points out that Germany's plan to deploy 500,000 troops not only violates the Treaty of Versailles, but also violates other equally binding conventions. This note was decided after a three-hour cabinet meeting today. In addition to passing this note of protest to Germany, the cabinet also approved Italian-British negotiations to facilitate a tripartite conference between England, France, and Italy. In addition, the cabinet also decided to submit the German issue to the League of Nations, and approved Foreign Minister Laval's visit to Moscow at Stalin's invitation, simultaneously with Eden. The Foreign Ministry also announced that Foreign Minister Suvich of Italy, Foreign Minister Laval of France, and Minister Eden of England will represent their respective governments at a meeting on Saturday. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, news here is that France's appeal to the League of Nations against Germany's rearmament will require at least eight days for the League of Nations to convene a meeting to deal with it, because it is necessary to find ways to ensure the attendance of diplomatic authorities from the ten Russian and two countries. People here believe that the possibility of Germany returning to the League of Nations is now becoming smaller and smaller. Some quarters argue that Germany's former colonies, which are now entrusted to other countries for trusteeship, can be effectively taken over by the trustee countries. (20th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Germany is greatly angered to learn that Britain is unwilling to recognize its rearmament as a fait accompli and use it as a basis for negotiations. Britain still insists on using the Treaty of Versailles, which is seen as a humiliation by the German people, as the basis for negotiations, as can be seen from the note issued in London on Monday. However, its meaning is profound and difficult to grasp at once. It was stated here today that after British Foreign Secretary Simon arrives in Berlin on Sunday, the German government will declare to him that Germany's restoration of armaments is a fait accompli. It is understood that Head of State Hitler's attitude is firm and the Treaty of Versailles cannot be the starting point for British-German negotiations, because Germany believes that the expansion of armaments by other European countries has clearly violated the treaty. The German government and people believe that their country should have the right to ensure future security on this basis, and cannot take the provisions into account. Today, fifteen giant bombers and thirty-five high-speed fighter planes appeared in the skies over Berlin, soaring into the sky and performing various technically sophisticated maneuvers, as a prelude to tonight's air defense exercises, and also to show its air force strength. (20th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) It is said that Head of State Hitler's special envoy, Ribbentrop, will come to London today. It is rumored that Ribbentrop's visit to England will include meetings with Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Chancellor Hailsham. Lord Chancellor Hailsham once represented Prime Minister MacDonald in Germany to discuss disarmament issues with Hitler. (20th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>France Takes Dual Approach Against Germany Yesterday, Protesting Based on the Treaty, While Requesting the League of Nations to Handle It</h3>
<p>(Paris) The French government's note protesting Germany's abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and the restoration of compulsory conscription will be delivered to the Berlin government by the French Ambassador to Germany, Ponsot. In addition, the Council of State decided today to invoke Article 11 of the Covenant of the League of Nations and Articles 164 and 213 of the Treaty of Versailles to request the Council of the League of Nations to deal with Germany's decision. The Council of State also decided to respond to the invitation of the Soviet government, Foreign Minister Laval went to Moscow to discuss everything with representatives of the Soviet government, but the date of departure does not seem to have been determined yet. (20th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The French government has decided to submit the matter of Germany's violation of the treaty and restoration of compulsory conscription to the Council of the League of Nations for handling. As soon as the Secretariat of the League of Nations receives the telegram from the French government, it will immediately telegraph the current chairman of the Council, Turkish Foreign Minister Rüştü, and Rüştü will consult with the representatives of the countries attending the Council to determine the date of the Council meeting. According to the decision made by the Council of the League of Nations in January this year at the request of Soviet Foreign Commissioner Litvinov, any abnormal meeting of the Council must be notified to the countries attending at least five days before the meeting, so the Council will not be held within five days. (20th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French Foreign Office is still very busy today. Foreign Minister Laval met with the British Chargé d'Affaires twice. The French government's note of protest to Germany has now been drafted and will be sent to Berlin as soon as it is approved by the Administrative Council today. The note is two pages long and is worded strongly. The French side believes that its argument is impeccable in terms of morality and law. When the French Ambassador to Berlin submits this note, it will be accompanied by an oral statement. The content of the note will reportedly denounce Germany's unilateral abolition of the treaty as a violation of human rights. Foreign Minister Laval exchanged views with Britain and Italy repeatedly by telephone throughout yesterday. It is rumored in political circles that Laval intends to hold a joint meeting of England, Italy, and France in Paris or Rome to decide on the attitude towards Germany. Although there is no concrete decision on this matter, it is believed that it is possible to realize it. If this tripartite conference can be realized, it will be held before Simon and Eden go to Berlin. However, Britain's attitude is unclear, which has caused French newspapers to express indignation towards Britain. It is also heard that the French and Italian governments sent the same note to the British government last night, urging it to pay attention. Finally, the French Foreign Minister also met with Soviet Russian Ambassador Potemkin to discuss the Eastern European Convention and the matter of accompanying Laval to Moscow.

<h3>Procedures for Tripartite Conference of England, France, and Italy, Two Meetings Will Be Held One After Another</h3>
<p>(Rome) The meeting of representatives of England, France, and Italy to be held in Paris on March 23 before British Foreign Secretary Simon goes to Germany is a preparatory meeting, dedicated to preparing for the second meeting. The date and location of the second meeting will be decided after Simon returns to the country, but the location may be decided in northern Italy, so that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini can personally participate. (210th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) The matter of holding a meeting of representatives of England, France, and Italy before British Foreign Secretary Simon goes to Germany has been agreed upon by the governments of England, France, and Italy this morning. This meeting was proposed by the British side and is scheduled to be held in Paris on Saturday this week. The British side will be represented by Lord Privy Seal Eden, and the Italian side will be represented by Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich. This matter was decided by the British Cabinet meeting this morning. Eden also attended the Cabinet meeting. At that time, it was also decided that the Paris meeting would be a "comprehensive discussion." After Eden comes to Paris on Saturday to attend the meeting, he may return to London on the same evening. (20th Havas Telegram)</p>
<h3>London Denies Saying That France Protested to England, But Italy and France Were Once Dissatisfied with England</h3>
<p>(London) It has been denied that the French Ambassador to England has protested to the British government regarding the British note to Germany. The authorities of England and France are now continuing to exchange views in accordance with the spirit of the London Declaration of February 3. (19th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government is now maintaining close contact with the authorities of England and France in order to know for sure the scope of future British-German talks. Most people here believe that the attitude adopted by Britain is not very suitable for the needs of the European situation. For the sake of the country, it is best to issue a solemn protest to Germany in conjunction with Italy and France. (19th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) It was learned today that France will not submit quietly to Germany's abandonment of the Versailles Treaty, regardless of Britain's attitude. Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval are today working on drafting a letter of protest, which will severely criticize German Head of State Hitler's reintroduction of conscription. It is said that the note will be sent to Berlin tomorrow after being approved by the Cabinet meeting. Today, senior French officials criticized Britain's intention to recognize Germany's abandonment of the treaty quite harshly. After hearing that British Foreign Secretary Simon refused France's request to come to Paris before going to Germany, the dissatisfaction increased. On the one hand, France has proceeded to deepen its understanding with the Balkan and Little Entente countries. However, its biggest goal at present is to obtain the support of Soviet Russia. According to reliable sources, Foreign Minister Laval has accepted the invitation of Soviet Russia and is scheduled to arrive in Moscow on the 27th of this month. When Laval visits Russia, he will also meet with British Lord Privy Seal Eden. In this way, there may be a tripartite conference with Stalin. Well-informed political observers claim that Laval's trip is aimed at seeking a complete understanding with Soviet Russia because of Germany's recent actions, but the result may be to exclude Germany based on an agreement on military mutual assistance and establish an Eastern European Locarno Pact. The treaty should first be concluded by France, Russia, and Czechoslovakia, and then Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania will probably also participate. Some optimists even say that Poland can finally join. If the treaty is concluded, no matter what Germany does, it will be difficult to disrupt the peace of Europe. International scholars recognize that the source of European chaos is not actually between France and Germany, but in Central Europe and the Balkan Peninsula. As for how Germany will react to the talks, no one dares to predict, but it will probably not be welcome. If you look at the map, you can see that after the treaty is concluded, Germany will be surrounded on three sides, east, west, and south. The policy of the French Foreign Minister is very clear. For the sake of France, Laval must handle the Eastern European issue properly in order to restrain the western encroachment of Germany. (19th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>British Air Force Budget Submitted to the House of Commons, An Additional £3,000,000, Totaling £23,851,000, MacDonald Announces New Invention of Air Defense Law</h3>
<p>(London) Air Force Undersecretary Sir Sassoon submitted the Air Force budget for 1935 to the House of Commons today, stipulating an additional expenditure of £3,089,000, with a total net expenditure for the year of £20,650,000, and a gross amount of £23,851,000, an increase of £3,685,000 compared with 1934. Sir declared that for the sake of peace, the US government has delayed implementing Britain's lowest air defense procedures in the past decade. The weakness of Britain's air defense is a danger to world peace and Britain itself. Britain can no longer allow its air force to rank fifth in the first line of strength among air powers. At the same time, he did not want to exaggerate the weakness of the British Air Force. At present, only the first line of strength in France and Russia is far superior to Britain. The number of aircraft in the United States and Italy is only slightly better than that of Britain, but there are fewer qualified pilots in active service than in the Royal Air Force. The design and performance of the Royal Air Force's aircraft are not inferior to any country, but technical progress has been very rapid in recent years, so in addition to increasing the number of aircraft, it is also necessary to re-determine the equipment procedures. He hopes that the construction period of new aircraft can be shortened in the future. The British aircraft manufacturing industry can still make profits. The total value of British aircraft exports in 1934 increased by 31% compared with 1933. There are currently 29 foreign countries using British aircraft and 33 foreign countries using British aviation engines. At the same time, the expansion of the Royal Air Force has had to first increase the number of air stations and airfields. The additional expenditure of 3.5 million pounds in the 1934 budget was mostly due to this project. The Air Force is now offering a reward of £25,000 to British manufacturers to produce the best commercial aircraft. It is also planned to manufacture two high-altitude and long-range experimental aircraft. If they are satisfactory, Britain intends to win the world record for altitude and non-stop flight.</p>
<p>One of the highlights of the debate was the remarks made by Mr. Churchill. According to reports, the actual strength of the British and German air vehicles was equal in November last year. Since then, Britain's position has been worse. Today, Germany has at least 6 days of first-line aircraft, and there is a possibility of increasing it to about 1,500 in 1935-36. Britain's air force program is extremely inadequate and has entered a very dangerous period. The great war that ended in 1918 may be repeated today, but he still hopes and believes that it can be saved in the end. Sir Sassoon replied that according to the latest news received by the government, there are various reasons to believe that the British Air Force is still stronger than Germany today.</p>
<p>Since October last year, the overall situation has deteriorated to a certain extent, and the manufacture of German aircraft has been greatly accelerated, but he believes that Britain can still have a slight advantage by the end of this year. Britain's program is defensive and can be increased or decreased at any time according to the needs of the situation.</p>
<p>The hope of limiting armaments has not been abandoned. He does not think that accelerating expansion has now reached the final necessity, but the overall situation is very worrying today. The government will not slacken in the full protection of the country and the entire empire. The Air Force budget stipulates that by the end of 1938, the Royal Air Force will increase by a total of four and a half detachments, and stipulates that the first-line strength will have a total of 1,330 aircraft, plus 120 aircraft in the irregular team. The National Defense Force will increase by 11 new detachments, totaling 54 detachments, of which 41 detachments are for regular duty, and the rest are auxiliary or special reserves. The Air Force of the Navy Fleet will increase by 11 first-line aircraft. This new organization will increase the strength of the British Air Force, including the aircraft of the fleet, to a total of 105 and a half detachments. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) British Prime Minister MacDonald briefly described the British government's plan for the defense against sky attacks in the House of Commons today, saying that the government is not satisfied with relying solely on counterattacks to protect the sky. A committee of scientific experts was organized months ago to investigate the possibility of using the latest inventions to resist sky attacks. The committee has prepared concrete proposals and has now started preliminary tests. The government decided to appoint a special committee on sky defense to unify the work of the navy and civil affairs in the field of sky defense. This special committee will conduct a full investigation and raise the necessary funds for research. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>German Military Aircraft Appear Publicly for the First Time, Large-Scale Air Defense Exercises in Berlin</h3>
<p>(Berlin) German Air Force exercises began tonight. First, 40 military aircraft flew in Beijing and its suburbs for a long time. Since the European War, today is the first time that military aircraft have flown over the capital. Residents are very interested in the air defense exercises. In the evening, all the houses in the city had their lights turned off and their windows closed. All kinds of vehicles driving on the streets had their lights covered. People were stationed on the bell towers of various churches to monitor whether residents were complying with the order to turn off the lights. At 11 o'clock, it was assumed that enemy air forces came to bomb, and the city would be completely dark at that time. (20th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This afternoon, 36 newly established air force fighter planes and 15 bombers held their first exercises in the sky over the city. Residents all craned their necks to watch and were very interested. At one point, the planes flew in close formation, skimming over the rooftops, causing the crowd to feel anxious. The Commander-in-Chief of the Air Force, Aviation General Göring, ordered the team to come here. His intention was clearly to show the public the horror of aerial warfare. At the same time, Foreign Minister Neurath told a Reuters reporter that the measures Germany is taking now are necessary for equality, and Head of State Hitler has announced that he will never use this new army and air force for aggression, so the general feeling of security should be made a reality. Mr. Niu also said that if Europe has another great war, Europe will come to an end. The discussions after British Foreign Secretary Simon comes here will not be easy, but the current basis is clearer than before. (19th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Berlin became a dark world from 10 p.m. to midnight tonight, because at that time, soldiers and civilians were practicing large-scale air defense exercises. At exactly 10 o'clock, the lights in all store windows were turned off, and the windows of all homes, cafes, restaurants, and factories were covered with black cloth, so that no light leaked out. At exactly 11 o'clock, most of the street lights were also turned off. The remaining 1,500 street lights were also covered with thick black cloth, leaving only a small circle of round light below. As a result, the entire city was as dark as a dead city. This afternoon, a team of 24 fighter planes and several bombers soared into the sky to inform the residents of Berlin of the preparations for tonight's exercises in advance.

<h3>A Perspective on England's Note of Protest to Germany</h3>
<p>— Wei</p>
<p>Since Germany recently declared the establishment of an air force and the implementation of compulsory military service, the only country in Europe that has been alarmed is not France. France is particularly alarmed. For the past fifteen years after the war, France has regarded England as its right and left hand in diplomacy. Therefore, England participated in the Locarno Pact, the Paris Convention, the Lausanne Agreement, and the London Agreement. In the London Agreement, England and France intended to replace the military clauses of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles with "general military measures." France granted Germany the right to military equality, and England mediated to enable Germany to return to Geneva to discuss disarmament. This was already a very big concession for France, but Germany still felt it was not enough. Therefore, the London Agreement was still fresh, and Germany announced the establishment of an air force and rearmament.</p>
<p>Germany's expansion of armaments is to ensure its own security and must have active countermeasures. England, with the London Agreement in place, cannot stay out of the matter. Will England uphold its commitment to promoting the law to suppress Germany, or will it abandon its promise and promote Germany to suppress France? One of the two must be the case. Judging from the content of England's note of protest to Germany, England's attitude seems difficult to grasp. At first, it said, "After the German government announced the air force, it had the latest declaration, which, in addition to the point of principle in dispute, greatly increased the unrest in Europe." Then it said, "England has concentrated its efforts in Geneva to seek the success of replacing the military clauses of Part V of the Treaty of Versailles with general military measures." From the former, it seems to support France's past position, while from the latter, it seems to support Germany's actions today. There should be no support for the latter if there is criticism of the former, and there should be no criticism of the former if there is support for the latter. With England's diplomatic tact, there should be no such contradiction. There must be a deep meaning in this. Generally speaking, from the perspective of European international relations, France is only afraid of Germany, while England is only afraid of Russia. It is not afraid of Germany. France fears German revenge, and Russia fears German aggression. The targets of France and Russia are the same, so the two countries have the possibility of uniting. However, Germany has ambitions to invade Russian territory, and England has a national policy of preventing Russia from instigating rebellions in its colonies. Their targets are also the same. The union of England and Germany is also not impossible. On the day Germany announced its rearmament, the English Foreign Secretary's visit to Berlin did not stop. Its purpose was not so much to "enhance universal understanding" as it was to win over Germany to form an anti-Russian bloc.</p>
<p>If the above analysis is not far from the truth, then the division of military and diplomatic affairs in Europe in the future is very obvious. In order to defend against German revenge and eastern aggression, France and Russia will form a large group, and the Little Entente will be its wings. In order to rectify the military, promote militarism, and prevent the expansion of red forces, Germany and England can also form a group, and Poland and Japan will be its wings. Today's military alliance diplomacy is very similar to the situation on the eve of the Great War in 1914. Who says that the current situation of international peace in Europe is not in imminent danger?</p>
<h3>朝日 Plane Flies to Beijing</h3>

<h3>Zhao Pilian Discusses the Mongolian Industry Company Plan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Pilian said, "The new Chairman Huang Musong will take office on April 1st. I have served as Vice Chairman for three years, and I am ashamed to have made no achievements. I have already resigned from the Executive Yuan. The planned Mongolian Industry Company has been submitted to the Executive Yuan for review. Whether it will be approved is difficult to predict. Funding will be raised not only from the national treasury but also by soliciting commercial shares, but this is far from reality. The construction of the Mongolian-Tibetan reception center has been approved by the Executive Yuan to be renovated from temples in Beijing for use, and there is no need to build a new one. The General Affairs Department has been ordered to send personnel to survey." (20th, Special dispatch)</p>

<h3>Beijing Military Police Department Captures Culprit Who Stole Long-Distance Telephone Wires</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai) long-distance telephone lines in Qilinmen, Maqun Town, and other places have been stolen more than 14 times since last summer. Each time they were cut, Beijing-Shanghai telephone communication was immediately interrupted. Although repairs were made promptly, the time and economic losses were significant. Although rewards were offered for the arrest of the thief, the wire theft continued to occur. On the 18th of this month, the Criminal Investigation Team of the Military Police Department saw a person coming from Maqun, carrying two large bundles of purple copper wires. They immediately arrested him and found an insulated wire cutter and a steel file. He confessed to stealing the wires and said that Lou Yushan was the mastermind. On the morning of the 19th, Lou was also arrested. He confessed that he was formerly a squad leader in the Revenue Police Corps of the Ministry of Finance. He also revealed accomplices Zhi Yixi and Han Jinzhao, who were also arrested. Fifty-seven catties of wire were recovered. The entire case has now been handed over to the Garrison Headquarters for legal action. (20th, Special dispatch)</p>

<h3>Governor-General and Wife of French West Africa Die, Five Companions Also Die</h3>
<p>(Paris) French West African Governor-General Renard, his wife, three military officers, a pilot, and a radio operator went missing several days ago while inspecting the Lake Chad area by plane. It has now been ascertained that the plane crashed 150 kilometers south of Haut-Uele, Belgian Congo. All seven people on board were killed. Renard was formerly the Prefect of the Seine Department. In February of last year, he resigned at the same time as the Paris Police Commissioner Chiappe due to the Stavisky affair. His wife, the daughter of an American millionaire, also died tragically. In addition, the five military officers, pilot, and radio operator did not survive. It is also said that Renard's son died in a flying accident several years ago. (19th, Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels It was reported that the Governor-General of French Equatorial Africa, Mr. and Mrs. Rinar, and others went missing last Friday on an inspection tour by plane, and it was later reported that they had landed safely in a certain place in the Belgian Congo, with everyone on board unharmed. However, according to an official who arrived here today, Mr. and Mrs. Rinar and five companions were killed in the plane crash, and the fuselage was broken into pieces. According to the circumstances, the plane must have flown into a sandstorm, causing the pilot to lose control and make an emergency landing, resulting in this disaster due to excessive force upon landing.

<h3>After Resignation of Belgian Cabinet, All Parties Still Support Gold Standard, but France Believes Belgium Will Join Sterling Bloc, and Says Netherlands Will Take Similar Action</h3>
<p>Brussels After the resignation of the cabinet, the general impression is that a unified national cabinet should be organized, and it should be announced that the current exchange rate of the Belgian franc will be maintained. Socialist leader Vandervelde recently met with the King and, upon leaving the palace, stated that he had discussed with the King whether to dissolve the parliament and hold general elections. (19th, Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>Brussels Belgian Prime Minister Theunis declared in the House of Representatives today that the opposition party's movement against the government's plan to protect the Belgian currency was the cause of the cabinet's resignation. The government has been fighting for the Belgian currency since February 4, but the opposition party's movement prevented it from stopping the harm suffered by the Belgian franc. Before resigning, the government had taken the necessary measures to protect the national currency. He hopes that the new cabinet will receive the unified assistance of the entire country to overcome the future crisis. After Theunis's resignation, the right wing of the House of Representatives held a meeting and decided to support the policy of maintaining the gold standard, with only two votes against. At the same time, the left wing of the Senate also passed a similar resolution. The Socialist Party also declared its support for maintaining the gold standard. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) People here believe that the resignation of the Belgian cabinet was due to the French government's decision not to lend 4 billion francs to Belgium and not to give it sufficient commercial concessions. It is widely believed that Belgium will join the Sterling bloc, and the Netherlands seems to be taking similar action. It is expected that President Hoover will have an unexpected opportunity to submit the holding of a currency conference to the world. All gold standard countries now have a sense of panic. This afternoon, France formally provided assistance to the Belgian currency. It seems that France's hope of helping Belgium has not completely disappeared. After the resignation of the Belgian cabinet, the immediate impact on the London market was a rapid increase in the exchange rate of the pound sterling, due to a large demand for the pound sterling from Europe. However, the London stock market was uneasy because it feared that commercial competition would become more intense after Belgium abandoned the gold standard. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(New York) The foreign exchange market was very chaotic today after the Belgian cabinet collapsed. Gold coins, when converted into US dollars, were initially strong, but then plummeted, and the market atmosphere at the close was very panicky. The stock market did not seem to be affected by this. There were no major increases or decreases in Belgian securities. However, the closing price of the Belgian 7% public bond due in 1935 was 108.125, a decrease of 5.875 compared to Monday. People here regard the Belgian government's establishment of an exchange control bureau as a transitional measure, and it is possible that a more far-reaching plan will be formulated soon, or that all gold coins will be devalued uniformly. Some quarters believe that the sale of a large amount of raw cotton by foreign countries, especially France, shows that they want to obtain more US dollars in order to offset the losses that will be caused by the future devaluation or abandonment of the gold standard by the franc. Judging from this situation, speculators do not have much confidence in the ability of gold standard countries to maintain the gold standard, which can be seen generally. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>The Hague The Dutch government today submitted a bill stipulating a reduction of £8.5 million in government expenses, the purpose of which is to transfer these saved funds to a fund for protecting the Dutch currency. (19th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<h3>Italy and Abyssinia Refuse to Concede to Each Other in Dispute, New Incident Occurs in North Africa</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government today proposed to the Abyssinian government that the border dispute be resolved by the ambassadors of the two countries, without resorting to the Italo-Abyssinian Conciliation Commission. Negotiations between the two countries to resolve the dispute broke down a few days ago, so Abyssinia invoked Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant and petitioned the League of Nations. At the same time, both sides are still trying their best to salvage what appears to be a dangerous situation. A message was received here today from Italian Somaliland stating that a dispute had occurred on the border, but the details are not yet known. (20th, Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) A new incident has occurred on the border between Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland. In the area near Akobo, Abyssinia, an armed force robbed more than 100 camels between the Ernat and Korogoaya stations. Italian patrol soldiers immediately rushed to the area to pursue them, but the armed force had already retreated into Abyssinian-controlled territory. The Italian soldiers stopped at the border and did not pursue them further, to avoid causing further incidents. The Italian embassy in Abyssinia has received instructions from the government to formally protest to the Abyssinian government about this matter, and reserves the right to demand compensation for the losses suffered by Italian citizens. (20th, Havas News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian authorities issued a declaration today denying everything, because Abyssinia has repeatedly used foreign newspapers to launch attacks against Italy. According to the Italian statement, first, Italy has never rejected the proposal made by Abyssinia to organize an arbitration committee; second, the statement that Italy has ignored all documents delivered by Abyssinia is meaningless; third, the Italian government's dispatch of troops to Somaliland and Eritrea is of a self-defense nature and has not been secret, and the air force personnel accompanying the army to Africa are no more than what is applied in the ratio of troops sent to Africa. Finally, according to repeated reports from consuls, Abyssinia has recently mobilized troops to Somaliland, and this mobilization order has recently extended to the northern part of Abyssinia. According to reliable sources, the Italian government has sent a reply to the Abyssinian capital regarding the proposal to organize an arbitration committee. According to its contents, Italy believes that the possibility of a direct solution has not yet disappeared, and in order to quickly resolve all existing difficulties, direct negotiations are the only way. Italy is not opposed to arbitration, but only feels that the method of arbitration is too slow and complicated. Therefore, Italy has put forward a counter-proposal, which should involve the exchange and detailed examination of documents related to the various tragedies, along with the causes before the tragedies and the results after the tragedies, by the Abyssinian Foreign Minister and the Italian Ambassador to Abyssinia, so that the true situation can be revealed. The opinions put forward by Italy are also those proposed by the League of Nations, and are the fastest, most practical, and most effective solutions. (19th, National News Agency dispatch)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The document that Abyssinia sent to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, requesting the Council of the League of Nations to impartially mediate the dispute between Abyssinia and Italy in accordance with Article 15 of the League of Nations Charter, has been published here today. The document states that the dispatch of troops to Africa by Italy has created a dangerous situation of rupture between Abyssinia and Italy, and that in accordance with the methods proposed by the League of Nations General Assembly on January 19, Abyssinia and Italy should immediately begin direct negotiations, in order to quickly resolve the disputes caused by the incidents of mid-December last year. However, so far, Italy has neither shown a significant tendency to agree to direct negotiations, nor is willing to accept the mediation of a third party proposed by Abyssinia, and Italy has not expressed any opinion on Abyssinia's request to submit this case to arbitration, but has instead dispatched troops to Africa as a reply. The document also mentions Article 10 of the League of Nations Charter, which states that all member states of the League of Nations should respect each other's territorial integrity. The document further declares that Abyssinia is willing to maintain friendly relations with Italy, but for the sake of its rights and interests, it may request mediation in accordance with the provisions of Article 10 of the Charter. The document does not request the Council of the League of Nations to convene an immediate meeting, so the League of Nations will probably not deal with it drastically, but will wait for the next meeting of the Council in May.

Furthermore, a spray oil field has also been discovered in the Hsinchu area of Taiwan, which can also produce 200 stones per day. (20th, Japan United Press dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russia Proposes Russians Drink Russian Tea</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Soviet Russia's recent slogan is "Russians drink Russian tea." The authorities are trying hard to supply the needs of the people with tea grown in Russia. The Soviet Russian expedition team, led by Beritzin, Director of the Tashkent Research Institute, is now carrying tea trees produced in the plains near the Caspian Sea to be planted in Russian territory for trial cultivation. Russia's Transcaucasia currently has 80,000 acres of tea plantations, producing 900 pounds of tea per acre. The authorities hope that the tea consumed by Russia will soon be supplied from the country. Currently, most of what Russians consume is purchased from London. Although Russia already produces tea, Russians still prefer to drink Indian and Ceylon tea. (20th, Reuters dispatch)</p>

<h3>Mussolini's Eastern Policy and the Great Organization Under It (Correspondence from Rome)</h3>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has been in power for thirteen years. While focusing on internal affairs, he has recently strived to expand the nation's power abroad. In Europe, he initially sympathized with Germany, jointly calling for the revision of the Treaty of Versailles. Subsequently, he allied with France, gaining partial sovereignty in Africa. He employed both diplomatic and military means to the best of his ability. In recent years, he has apparently adopted a "conciliatory policy" towards Eastern Asia. While the purpose of this policy is not something we can know, our country is clearly one of its targets. Therefore, we must pay close attention to its organizational activities. Here is an account of the two major Eastern organizations newly established in Rome:</p>
<p>(1) The Institute for Oriental Studies</p>
<p>The Institute for Oriental Studies (Istituto Italiano Per il Medio ed Estremo Oriente) is an Italian academic organization dedicated to the study of Eastern issues. It is located at No. 61 Via Monte Serrato, Rome. The president is Qin Dilai, a current member of the Senate. Mr. Qin Dilai is quite wealthy and extremely enthusiastic about Eastern studies. The institute was inaugurated at the same time as the First Oriental Students' Association and has been in operation for over a year. (For details on the opening of the Oriental Students' Association, see last year's Shen Bao Monthly). The institute's organizational structure, in addition to the president, includes a vice president and a secretary. Members include many individuals with considerable political or social standing and those with a strong interest in Eastern issues. The institute places particular emphasis on the Far East and has established Chinese and Japanese language study classes. Teachers are hired to teach in the same classroom, but at different times. The institute also has a reference room. The reporter once visited and observed a considerable collection of Chinese and Japanese books and newspaper materials. The newspaper clippings are classified on cards, and each room contains bookshelves filled with publications on Eastern issues.</p>
<p>Mussolini once gave a public lecture at the institute. On average, such public lectures are held once a week. On the 12th of this month, Hua Lai, the former Italian Minister to China, gave a lecture on "The Dawn of a New Chinese Culture." A large audience attended, including Liu Wendao, our ambassador to Italy. Although his remarks contained some distortions of the situation in China (he was stationed in China in 1928, and much of what he said related to the situation several years ago), his attitude was fair, and he expressed great sympathy for China and praised the New Life Movement. On the 18th of this month, Father Buliya was specially invited to lecture on the life of Mr. Sun Yat-sen and his influence on the Chinese nation.</p>
<p>The institute also publishes many books on Eastern issues, all printed in Italian and sold at the institute and in bookstores. After each lecture, the speech is usually sent to newspapers in Rome and elsewhere.</p>
<p>(2) The Oriental Students' Association</p>
<p>The Confederation of Oriented Students has also been established for more than a year and has held two general assemblies. The first was in December of the year before last, which Mussolini himself attended. More than a hundred Chinese students from various European countries came to Rome, along with about six hundred students from other Eastern countries, making it a grand occasion. After the meeting, the Oriental Students' Association was officially established, and it was resolved to establish a permanent office in Rome.</p>
<p>The second assembly was held from December 27th to 31st of last year. Representatives from Chinese students studying in Germany, Austria, and Italy, the Indian and Ceylon European Students' Association, Siamese students studying in France, Belgium, the Netherlands, and Germany, Arab students studying in Switzerland and France, Egyptian students studying in Germany and France, Japanese students studying in Switzerland, and Javanese students studying in Germany attended, totaling about 150 people. The meeting resolved to draft new organizational regulations to revise the content of the Oriental Students' Association. Previously, the association consisted entirely of individual members. The new general regulations changed it into an alliance of student organizations. It was also decided that the association would be divided into three organizations: "General Assembly," "Board of Directors," and "Standing Committee." During the subsequent election of officers, there was a brief dispute because Japanese representative OGHISSIMA, a student studying in Switzerland, colluded with Persian representative Hossein Danesch, a student studying in Germany, to sabotage the association. They first advocated for the re-election of the incumbent president as the president of this session because Danesch was the first president. However, their plan was opposed by the majority. Therefore, the general assembly resolved to express a vote of no confidence in the former president, passing the motion by a vote of 120 to 16 to elect a new president. Danesh then withdrew from the assembly, and Egyptian representative Galal, the former vice president, also resigned. The assembly ignored this and elected Liao Jiabao, the Chinese representative, as president, and Indian representative Sundaram, B. Litt, and Arab representative Chekil el-Djabri as vice presidents. One representative each from Siam, Annam, Ceylon, and China served as honorary secretaries and accountants. The four members of the Standing Committee were Indian representatives Saxker and Dubash, Arab representative Salem, and Chinese representative Lin Jiesheng. Before the election was completed, the Egyptian representative suddenly expressed his intention to withdraw his resignation, but because the matter had already been announced, the assembly did not consider it further.</p>
<p>Therefore, China can be said to have had a considerable victory in the second assembly. The failure of the Japanese representative's conspiracy further stabilized the foundation of the Oriental Students' Association. On January 16th of this year, the association issued a notice to all parties, stating that the association's purpose was to "promote the cultural and general interests of Eastern students studying in Europe" and solemnly stated that "all elections and discussions in the association are based on the free will of the students and are not influenced by external forces. At the same time, Eastern students studying in Europe are welcome to provide more assistance so that it can become a completely independent cultural organization." The attitude is open and aboveboard, and there is nothing to criticize. However, it is unknown whether the facts will be as stated. The association publishes a publication called "New Asia," with its address at No. 1 Via Del Cobservatorio. (February 18th)</p>

<h3>Inspection Tour of the Northwest</h3>
<p>— Special Correspondent Geng Ya</p>
<p>A Glimpse of the Life of the Chantu People in Xinjiang</p>
<p>The Chantu people account for approximately 60% or more of the total population of Xinjiang. Their language, script, appearance, and customs are all different from those of other ethnic groups. They have high noses, deep-set eyes, and sturdy builds, resembling Westerners. However, their skin is brownish-yellow, their eyes and hair are black, and they traditionally wear beards, shaved in an arc from the ears to the lower jaw, in what is called the "ten-ear style." Approximately 1,300 years ago, Islam, "holding the scriptures in one hand and the sword in the other," conquered eastwards over the Pamir Mountains, capturing Kashgar and other places. The Chantu people came under their rule and unanimously converted to Islam. Their script is written horizontally from right to left, with twenty-two letters, including fifteen vowels and seventeen consonants. The pronunciation is light and smooth, with many guttural and lingual sounds and few labial and dental sounds, sharing a common origin with Turkish, although there are slight differences in intonation. The language is consistent, for example, calling father "Dadan," mother "Alang," children "Balangzi," girls "Keqi," and boys "Wokeluo," etc. Those who engage in public business or trade learn to speak Chinese out of necessity, but the pronunciation is difficult to articulate clearly. For example, one popular ditty they like to sing originally says, "I'd rather eat plain glory than scallions, I'd rather be a commoner than a soldier. Alas, alas, those who eat the emperor's grain have no conscience." They sing it as "I'd rather ride a cypress than a pine, I'd rather be a common surname than a collapse. Alas, alas, those who ride wolves have no wolf's heart." Unless one learns from a young age, it is not easy to be fluent and clear.</p>
<p>The Chantu people mainly rely on agriculture for their livelihood, followed by animal husbandry and commerce. Their food consists of wheat flour, yellow millet, millet, and rice. They often eat "jixi," which is made by mixing wheat flour with water and sticking it to the inner wall of a clay stove to be baked over a small fire. Feasts include "pilaf," "oily flatbread," "roasted meat," and "boiled mutton." Camels, horses, cattle, and sheep are all considered premium foods. Pilaf is made with half-cooked meat, topped with puffed rice, and seasoned with pepper, green onions, and lard. It is mixed well when cooked, served on a large platter, and eaten by hand, hence the name. Other dishes such as roasted meat and oily flatbread are also fragrant and delicious. These foods are also found in the interior, but the names and preparation methods are slightly different. The poor often eat "jixi" and drink water, willingly enduring hardship. The slaughter of livestock does not require an "ahong" (imam); it can be done by any member of the same faith. Pork is not eaten, nor is it raised. In counties such as Qiemo and Ruoqiang, pigs are almost extinct. In all the counties of southern Xinjiang, Han and Manchu people rarely eat pork in public, to avoid offending the Chantu people. Other items such as tea, sugar, grapes, dried apricots, and milk curd are used to treat guests. Smoking and drinking are forbidden by religious rules, but some still indulge occasionally. However, no one smokes opium, which is a very good thing. The Chantu people like three types of alcohol: one is brewed from sand dates, one is made from rice and wheat, with a light and sweet taste similar to Gansu's water wine, and the third is made by putting mare's milk in a leather bag, kneading it for a long time, and placing it in a warm place to ferment overnight. Xinjiang is rich in white grapes, which are crystal clear, seedless, sweet, and inexpensive, far superior to American beauty-brand raisins. If they could be expertly made into wine, it would surely surpass imported products.</p>
<p>Men wear right-fastening, narrow-sleeved, round-collared long gowns, with an unslit lower hem and a cloth belt around the waist, and a small knife is worn on the left. Summer clothes are plain white, while cotton and fur clothes vary in shades of red and brown. Ahongs and wealthy people wear a straight-front jacket over their long gown, resembling a Western-style coat. Women's clothes have collars but no fastenings. They cover their heads and wear a set of clothes underneath. Women who have given birth have an opening in the chest for breastfeeding. They prefer red and green colors and wear vests or short jackets (as shown in Figure 1). When going out, they cover their faces with a gauze scarf, holding it when the wind blows. If several men approach, they must stand aside to let them pass. The number of braids varies among women, all combed down the back. Their faces are painted with cosmetics, moderately applied. The eyebrows of young girls are painted together as one, to distinguish them from married women. They wear a flat-topped hat, embroidered with gold, silver, and colored threads, and flowers, which are quite expensive. Men's hats have a red tassel, or in winter they wear fur-trimmed cotton hats, and in summer they wear various styles of cloth caps. Men wear leather boots, reaching to the knees, while women also wear leather boots and shoes. Ahongs often wrap their heads in white cloth, greatly resembling the turbaned Indians, leading some to believe that this is the origin of the term "turbaned heads," but this is probably not the case.</p>
<p>Houses are flat-roofed and square, without ridges or gables, covered with mud bricks and decorated with floral patterns on the top. A skylight is opened for light and ventilation. The walls are carved with niches to store boxes, items, and bedding, arranged in an orderly manner, or covered with cloth curtains. A kang (heated platform) is built on the ground, slightly higher than a foot, hollow inside for heating in winter. Felt carpets are spread on top for sitting and sleeping. Farming families may pad wheat stalks under the felt to replace sun-drying. The kang is large and serves the same purpose as a wheat threshing floor in summer. Meals are eaten on a small table about a foot high for sitting around. Beds, tables, and benches are generally not provided. Stoves and cooking ranges are built along the edges of the wall, with pipes leading to the high roof to vent smoke. Turpan is hot in summer, requiring specially dug underground rooms.</p>
<p>Marriage age is mostly seventeen or eighteen for men and fourteen or fifteen for women. The old practice of marrying at thirteen is gradually decreasing. Marriage does not avoid blood relations, hence the saying, "Within three generations, uncles and brothers are respected; beyond three generations, there is no order." Some couples fall in love on their own, while others are introduced and presided over by parents, elders, ahongs, etc. Before the wedding, the groom's family sends gifts such as cattle, sheep, cloth, tea, and foreign wax to the bride's family and invites relatives and ahongs to the bride's home to discuss the marriage and recite scriptures to confirm the engagement. At the wedding, the bride is carried by her father or brother onto a horse and led to the groom's house with music. Distant relatives and neighbors offer food as congratulations and hold a banquet for a "weilang" (gathering). The groom and bride, in particular, have "weilang" rituals, and their every word and action is deliberately exaggerated by well-wishers for amusement, lasting a whole day before the crowd disperses. Divorce is called "linggan" or "yangdiao." The initiative is with the man, who must give the woman a generous gift. If the initiative is with the woman, she cannot take anything from the husband's house. Children are divided for upbringing, with ancestors guiding their education. After divorce, there are cases of reconciliation and restoration to the original state. Widows are allowed to remarry, and polygamy is permitted by custom. However, women must wait one hundred days after divorce before remarrying, probably due to physiological reasons. Whether it is a divorce or a marriage, an ahong is required to witness it. When a child is born, an ahong must recite scriptures and wash the child, and offer auspicious words. The child is named on the thirteenth day, with either two or three characters, or five or six characters, each with a meaning, but there are no surnames. Names are often the same, so the place of origin or occupation is prefixed to distinguish them. When a boy reaches the age of five or six, an ahong is invited to recite scriptures and remove the foreskin in a week. The same lighter procedure is performed by Han and Hui people in Gansu and Qinghai, which is said to be beneficial for physiological cleansing. Unfortunately, those who perform the circumcision often lack medical experience, easily causing bleeding and swelling in the circumcised children. Parents' inheritance is shared by children, usually seven tenths for sons and three tenths for daughters, or a ratio of two to one. When a woman marries, she can take what she receives to her husband's home, and it is returned to her in case of divorce.</p>
<p>The deceased is washed with water, wrapped in white cloth, and placed in a public wooden coffin, decorated with brocade. It is carried to the mosque, where the ahong recites the guiding scriptures, and then it is buried in the cemetery. A rectangular pit more than ten feet deep is dug, with a hole leading to the side from the bottom. The wooden coffin is removed, and the corpse is thrown into the hole. If it falls face down, it means the person committed a heavy sin and is imprisoned. Rapid chanting of scriptures is needed for redemption. If it falls face up, it means ascending to heaven, and rebirth in a blessed land is possible. If it falls sideways, it means a reduction of lifespan due to sin, and the soul is still wandering. Finally, the corpse is buried in the hole, facing west, and covered with earth to build a grave. The styles are different for men and women. Scriptures are recited on the third day to remove mourning clothes, and there are also several periods of mourning. In wealthy families, the corpse is kept in the central hall, and scriptures are recited for one or two days. However, the burial date is never delayed beyond the third day. The Hami royal tombs are walled with green glazed tiles, with a round top and square base, resembling palaces, covering many tombs below, truly magnificent architecture outside the pass (as shown in Figure 2).</p>
<p>"Weilang" is the name of the Chantu people's song and dance. The instruments include flat drums, sheng (mouth organ), and stringed instruments. The flat drum has a single surface with small iron rings attached inside. The left hand holds the edge, and the right hand strikes the drum surface, producing a "dong dong" sound, while the rings also make a "zheng zheng" sound. Combined with the blowing and plucking of the sheng and strings, the rhythm, fast or slow, high or low, all matches the emotions of the song and dance. The dance is performed either in a room or under the shade of trees. First, the opening drum lyrics are played, leading the male and female guests into the venue. The meaning of the lyrics is like, "Open a bright road, lead everyone to walk leisurely..." "There is a tree on the Gobi Desert, its shadow falls on the ground, there is a pedestrian on the road, his heart is on his sister." Then, the men and women dance in separate pairs, advancing and retreating in coordination, with neat steps. They raise their arms in gestures, and their waists and hips sway from side to side. Their expressions are serious, sad, and joyful, very vivid and lifelike. The scene is quite similar to Western dance, except that they do not embrace each other in pairs. After the social dance, they rest and dine together. Soon, the music resumes, followed by a dance to attract affection. The woman rolls a flower with a handkerchief and looks around at the male and female guests, choosing a loved one of the opposite sex and making a gesture of invitation and temptation. The invited person rises up and responds to the dance under the watchful eyes of the crowd, then exchanging an object with each other, and another person takes over. The state of children is moving. Generally, young girls like to invite young men, and women like to invite strong men. If the invited person does not respond, the inviter considers it a great insult. This custom probably originated in the nomadic era, when men and women pleased each other and flirted with flowers and plants, passed down to become today's custom. Finally, someone witty is publicly chosen to dress up as a madman searching for his wife, or a new bride escaping, etc., the rest of the entertainment is graphic and causes bursts of laughter before dispersing. Weilang borders on obscenity, and chieftains and ahongs often do not allow outsiders to visit. However, if it is believed that the inherent entertainment of the people is of poor taste, then social education should be actively promoted to improve the interests of the people's entertainment. If merely passive prohibition is used, it will be difficult to curb its natural development.</p>
<p>In addition, the Kazakhs mostly lead nomadic lives and rarely engage in agriculture. Although they share the same religion as the Chantu people, their culture is far inferior. The lives of the Mongols are roughly the same as those in Chahar and Suiyuan. The situation of the Gansu Hui people, except for religious beliefs, is mostly the same as the Han people. The Manchus are almost completely assimilated to the Han people.</p>

<h3>Yutian Reorganization Takes Time</h3>
<p>Authorities Have Drafted Steps, Starting with the Reorganization of Local Defense</p>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Yutian Security Team, after much wrangling, finally completed its change of guard the other day. Zhou Yuying's troops carried out their entry into the county town and deployed troops to defend the Ya Hong Bridge. However, the departure of this security supplement team from Yutian was not what they wanted. If it hadn't been for the multiple meetings between the Chinese and Japanese sides, and the lack of any hindrance in diplomatic relations, Sun Yucheng, Liu Benzhi, and Feng Shoupeng's troops would never have willingly submitted to the transfer of defense. Although there was not much disturbance during the departure, the members of this team were a mixed bag, many of whom were unruly. Therefore, when Feng Shoupeng's troops marched east to Tangshan, and Liu Benzhi and Sun Yucheng's troops marched west to Tongxian, Yanjiao, and Xiadian, most of them deserted with their weapons along the way. Almost all of Feng Shoupeng's unit of plainclothes personnel, numbering two to three hundred, escaped. More than a hundred members of Shi Zhensheng's unit, the first company of the first battalion of Sun Yucheng's unit, also deserted. Wang Zixiu's unit, the second company, stopped advancing on the way to Yanjiao when they reached the border between Yutian and Tongxian. Because the Miting Bridge militia had assisted Wang Bingxiao's Yutian militia in attacking their unit, they took advantage of the passing of the large army and the militia's unpreparedness to launch a sudden attack, disarming the militia. More than a hundred merchants and residents were robbed. Li Yuansheng, the newly appointed commander of the Security Supplement Corps, could not enforce orders, and had no choice but to supervise the remaining troops to reach their defense areas first, and telegraph Yin Rugeng in Tianjin to request instructions. Feng Shoupeng's unit of plainclothes personnel initially fled to the border between Fengrun and Yutian counties, but after being pursued by the militia, they fled further out of Yanshan Pass. The Yutian-Jixian border had been harboring several hundred bandits from Liu Guitang's gang. Taking advantage of the Yutian team's change of guard, they attacked Linnancang and looted for two days and nights. After Zhou Yuying's troops assisted the militia in attacking, the bandits were overwhelmed and led by their leaders Wang Qingfang and Zhang Hanmin, suddenly fled out of Jieling Pass to join Feng Shoupeng's troops, waiting for an opportunity to strike. Zhou Yuying's troops, numbering only five hundred men in one battalion, had arrived in Yutian to maintain the county town and Ya Hong Bridge, and their strength was insufficient. Therefore, they did not dare to act rashly. The Reorganization Committee has been in contact with the Japanese side regarding what military actions to take against the various bandits and the rebel security teams and plans to increase the number of battalions by one, transferring them from Funing to assist. Once agreement is obtained, they can depart. Yin Rugeng came to Tianjin from Yutian on the 11th of this month and immediately contacted the Japanese military headquarters in Tianjin. A decision can only be made after Takahashi arrives. Yutian has been chaotic for more than a year, and the local area is almost completely empty. Small groups of bandits are rampant, and the local defense is domineering and does not listen to orders, and exceeds the number stipulated by the province by several times. Therefore, the authorities have decided to reorganize in steps, starting with the reorganization of the local defense, to ensure that all illegal organizations and militias are disbanded. Only then will they be reorganized according to the stipulated number. After this is completed, the next step is local reorganization, such as handling spring plowing relief and implementing rural cleanup. The rebel teams and bandits will then be gradually suppressed and pacified to allow those who have fled to return and those who have lost their jobs to find employment. It is planned to complete all these matters within two months. County Magistrate Zhao Congyi is currently discussing the progress with local people. However, the local vitality has been severely damaged. Although the plan is such, it will not be possible to pacify the area within half a year. (16th)</p>
<h3>Relief: Fear of Material Shortages in Bandit Areas; Jiangxi Establishes a Trade Organization in Bandit Areas</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: All the newly recovered bandit areas have undergone long-term occupation and destruction by the Red bandits, and the production mechanism and economic organization have been completely destroyed. The fear and difficulty of materials are self-evident. According to news from various front lines, Shicheng, Guangchang, Ruijin, Huichang, Yudu, Dian Country, Hengfeng, and Dexing, which were recovered last year, are all in ruins, with desolate sights everywhere. There is an extreme lack of able-bodied men, cash, and materials. Although they have been recovered for a long time, the local (bandit area) merchants are unable to resume business, and merchants from other places are hesitant to advance due to traffic difficulties and the desolate and unsettled local area. The disaster-stricken people after the robbery are extremely suffering from the lack of materials and high prices. The provincial government has specially decided to raise a large sum of tens of thousands of yuan to establish a trade organization in the bandit areas to transport and supply daily necessities to the bandit areas, and supply them to the disaster-stricken people in a cooperative manner, starting with the six counties of southern Jiangxi. According to political news, this organization will be co-located with the Rural Cooperative Association Office in Yudu and will first allocate 300,000 yuan to start controlling trade in the bandit areas. (March 14th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Province Raises Funds to Relieve Spring Famine</h3>
<p>Organizing Urgent Relief Works; Purchasing Seeds for Plowing</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: Anhui Province suffered a severe drought last year. The disaster-stricken area accounted for about two-thirds of the province's area. The direct and indirect losses of the people are almost incalculable. Now, during the spring season, the famine is even more pronounced. The provincial government recently planned to allocate 100,000 shi of relief rice and raise 160,000 yuan to select and organize urgent relief works, in order to appease the refugees and eliminate the source of bandits. The provincial government decided on this at a recent standing committee meeting. The Pi River, Chaohu Lake, Huayang River, Anjing, Qijing, and Li Huo road projects were approved for implementation. 1,700 shi of relief rice and 10,000 yuan of labor costs were allocated to the Pi River. 2,500 shi of relief rice and 50,000 yuan of labor costs were allocated to Chaohu Lake. 2,000 shi of relief rice and 300,000 yuan of labor costs were allocated to the Huayang River. 20,000 yuan has been allocated first, and the remaining 280,000 yuan will be allocated gradually after autumn. 2,200 shi of relief rice was allocated to the Anjing and Qijing roads, and 1,600 shi of relief rice was allocated to the Li Huo road. The relief rice will be allocated by the Food Regulation Committee. The labor costs for the Pi River, Chaohu Lake, and Huayang River will be raised by the Department of Finance and will be managed and distributed by the Department of Construction. The labor costs for the Anjing, Qijing, and Li Huo roads will be allocated separately. The entire Pi River and Chaohu Lake projects and the first phase of the Huayang River dredging project will be carried out to the extent that they can prevent summer floods. The Department of Construction will complete the allocated relief rice and labor costs for the Pi River and Chaohu Lake and the relief rice and 20,000 yuan allocated for the Huayang River within three months. The first phase of the Huayang River dam and culvert project will begin after the water level drops in autumn and will be completed in the spring of the 25th year with the additional 280,000 yuan. In addition, the provincial government previously approved the letter from the Provincial Disaster Relief Fund Raising Association, requesting to raise a large sum of money under the disaster relief preparation fund to check the situation of each county and distribute the purchase of seeds. It was issued to the Department of Civil Affairs and the Department of Construction for review. The two departments believe that the China Foreign Famine Relief Commission's special loan for agriculture in Anhui Province amounts to more than 800,000 yuan. According to the statistical report of the Anhui Provincial Rural Cooperative Committee, from the 21st year of the Republic of China to September of the 23rd year, the cooperative founded under the guidance of the committee in Anhui Province totaled 549, with loans of 250,218 yuan. Adding the agricultural loans for Huaining and other 15 counties this time, the estimated loan is 150,000 yuan, totaling no more than 400,218 yuan. The remaining amount is still less than 400,000 yuan. The seed problem for this year's spring plowing is extremely serious. Although the Department of Construction has drafted a notice to all places to follow and make overall plans in advance, and telegraphed the Executive Yuan to approve and allocate funds for purchasing and distributing seeds, it may not be effective in reality. Now, the provincial treasury is short of funds and cannot issue a large sum of money suddenly. The provincial government is requested to write to the National Economic Commission as soon as possible, ordering the China Foreign Famine Relief Commission to allocate the remaining special loan for agriculture in Anhui Province to the province for handling, or to the Anhui office of the commission to lend all the remaining funds to severely affected counties before the end of April, specifically for farmers to purchase seeds. (March 12th)</p>
<h3>Farmers' Association and Chamber of Commerce Request Increased Tax on Imported Rice and Wheat</h3>
<p>The Municipal Farmers' Association submitted a document to both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry yesterday, stating: "Regarding the dumping of foreign rice, which endangers the foundation of the nation, we earnestly request that you instruct relevant departments to prohibit it and increase the import tax rate to benefit agriculture. Our association has witnessed the large-scale import of foreign rice and wheat, which poses a deep and significant threat to the national economy and the people's livelihood. We have repeatedly petitioned your ministry to levy import taxes on foreign rice and wheat as a means of restriction. Your ministry graciously issued a decree on December 15th of the 21st year of the Republic of China, increasing the import tax rate on foreign rice and wheat. Farmers were hopeful for recovery, and rural revitalization seemed promising. Unexpectedly, last autumn, drought caused disaster, leading to poor harvests. Rice merchants from various regions rushed to Siam, Saigon, and other places to order large quantities of foreign rice to make up for the shortfall. Furthermore, after the United States implemented its silver policy, silver became expensive and gold cheap, causing exchange rates to fluctuate. As a result, the cost of foreign rice and wheat became low, leading to their dumping in China. According to a survey by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, over six million bags have been registered. The unregistered amounts reported by foreign firms are unknown. If increased taxes or other restrictive measures are not promptly implemented, the future of the rural economy and the people's food supply will be unimaginable. Moreover, the stock of domestically produced rice and wheat is still substantial in various regions. Even during the lean season, there is no need to worry. Our association is concerned that the already troubled financial situation will worsen with increased capital outflow, and the declining agricultural and commercial sectors will face further peril. Therefore, we dare to present the true situation and earnestly request your ministry to promptly instruct the relevant authorities to immediately adopt effective measures to prohibit rice merchants from placing further orders for foreign rice and to appropriately increase the originally set import tax rate on foreign rice and wheat to close loopholes and save the rural areas from imminent economic collapse. This is truly in the public interest."</p>
<p>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "To the Nanjing Ministry of Finance, we acknowledge receipt of a letter from the Municipal Grain Merchants Association on the 19th of this month (the original letter was published in this newspaper on the 16th). Based on this, we note that when your ministry issued an order last year to levy import taxes on foreign wheat, it was originally intended to collect at the highest tax rate. However, the current import tax on foreign wheat has not been fully collected, failing to curb the dumping of foreign wheat. With the domestic wheat supply abundant in various regions and the new wheat harvest about to begin, if the highest tax rate is not imposed, it will indeed harm the economic interests of farmers. Therefore, we report the situation by telegram and respectfully request your approval to increase the import tax on foreign wheat to close loopholes and protect domestic wheat. This is truly in the public interest. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce bows, Hao Yin."</p>

<h3>All-Zhejiang Association Concerned About Sericulture in Their Hometown</h3>
<p>Letter: The All-Zhejiang Association requests advance funds for purchasing cocoons and raising prices. The letter, dated March 13th, was sent to the Silk Improvement (Control) Committee: "Regarding the matter, our Zhejiang has long been known for its sericulture. Since the frequent failures of silk cocoons in recent years, farmers have viewed silkworm rearing with trepidation. The sericulture industry is declining day by day. This year, following the early drought disaster, as the silkworm season approaches, we should plan ahead and take measures to rescue the industry so that the general silkworm farmers can benefit slightly, provide livelihood for the disaster areas, and promote the revival of farmers. The most urgent matters at present are to secure funds for purchasing cocoons in advance and to raise cocoon prices. The value of cocoons produced in Zhejiang reached a peak of 40 million yuan in the best years. Although production has decreased and prices have fallen, the total funds needed for purchasing cocoons in the province still amount to over 10 million yuan. Given the current stagnation of Shanghai's financial situation, the banking sector is mainly restricting loans. Furthermore, considering the bleak overseas silk sales and the dismal state of the domestic silk industry, it will not be easy to secure the large amount of cocoon loans as in the past. Therefore, whether the cocoon purchase is conducted by government or private entities, it is necessary to raise reliable large-scale funds in advance. Improvising at the last minute may lead to neglecting one aspect for another. If there is even a slight delay, the cocoon season will arrive, but the funds will not be fully secured, resulting in cocoons without a market, wasted seed and leaf capital, and the cocoons will turn into moths and pupae, becoming useless. If no remedial measures are taken, the benefits of sericulture in southeastern China will disappear. As for the purchase price of cocoons, it should be raised compared to the autumn cocoons of last year. Last year, the purchase price of autumn cocoons, after deducting the cost of seeds, was only about 14 cents per market catty. Silkworm farmers not only made no profit but also incurred losses. It is proposed that the cost of seed production be covered by the surplus from last year's autumn cocoons or by subsidies from the National Economic Council, and no longer deducted from the cocoon price. This would allow the price to be raised by 10 cents or more, so that farmers can earn some profit and be encouraged to raise silkworms. By securing a source of income, the industry can be preserved and not be cut off. Rescuing cocoon sales will benefit Zhejiang's production and alleviate the disastrous situation. Our association is concerned about the future of Zhejiang's cocoons and cannot remain silent. We hereby send this letter to your committee for your consideration and implementation. We eagerly await your response. Sincerely, The All-Zhejiang Association of Shanghai, to the Silk Improvement Committee and the Silk Control Committee."</p>
<p>Reply Letter: The Silk Control Committee replied on the 18th: "We have received your letter stating that this year, following the drought disaster, as the silkworm season approaches, we should plan ahead and take measures to rescue the industry so that the general silkworm farmers can benefit slightly, provide livelihood for the disaster areas, and promote the revival of farmers. The most urgent matters at present are to secure funds for purchasing cocoons in advance and to raise cocoon prices, and you have elaborated on the importance of these two aspects. We have taken note of your suggestions and appreciate your concern for the cocoon industry. However, the matter is important and requires detailed discussion. We will adopt and implement your suggestions to the best of our ability within the possible scope. We hereby reply and request your attention. (Remaining text omitted)."</p>
<h3>China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Successfully Orders French Ship, Delivery on the Rhine River According to Contract</h3>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that Liu Hongsheng, the general manager of the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, recognizing that domestic water and land transportation have been implemented successively, leading to an insufficient allocation of ships, purchased a large cargo ship from France. After approval by the Ministry of Transportation, negotiations were held with the French agent, and a contract has been signed, stipulating delivery on the Rhine River. The ship has a gross tonnage of 5,600 tons and a price of 7,750 pounds. At the beginning of the negotiations, this was equivalent to 150,000 Chinese yuan. Due to fluctuations in the exchange rate, the value was approximately 130,000 yuan when the contract was signed. Payment is divided into three installments. The first and second installments have already been paid. After signing the contract, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company sent a foreign captain from Shanghai to the Rhine River to take delivery of the ship. The captain has already inspected and is sailing the ship to Shanghai, expected to arrive by the end of next month. After arriving in Shanghai, the purchase price will be paid in full. The ship has already secured some cargo bound for Shanghai. After arriving in Shanghai, the ship will sail the Shanghai-Lianyungang route, specializing in transporting cargo connecting with the Longhai Railway, such as cotton. The ship was originally named Xiafei (transliteration). It has been decided to rename it, but the new name has not yet been determined.</p>
<h3>Shipping Merchants Hold Meeting Today to Discuss Participating in Intermodal Transport; Private Ownership Attached to National Ownership Contradicts Original Intent</h3>
<p>The Ministries of Transportation and Railways, due to foreign shipping companies demanding to participate in intermodal transport in our country based on the principles of open doors and equal opportunity, specifically summoned representatives of all shipping merchants in Shanghai to Beijing for a meeting. It has been decided to refuse this request. However, even for private shipping companies participating in intermodal transport, they must be affiliated with national companies and cannot establish separate joint offices to ensure that intermodal transport cargo is handled by state-owned vehicles, preventing foreign companies from exploiting loopholes. After arriving in Shanghai, the representatives of private shipping companies, recognizing that this matter has significant implications for the future of their businesses and contradicts the previous central government decision allowing private shipping companies to participate in intermodal transport, have decided to convene a meeting of representatives from all shipping companies at the Shipping Association at 2:00 PM today to discuss the major issue of changing the participation of private shipping companies in intermodal transport.</p>
<h3>Refugees Expelled from Japan, 42nd Batch Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday; Pan Juming and Two Others Return on the Kasado Maru</h3>
<p>The number of refugees expelled from Japan who have successively arrived in Shanghai has reached over 500. It has been learned that the 42nd batch of refugees, Pan Juming, Zhou Shunyao, and two others, arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the Kasado Maru. After disembarking, the refugees stayed at the Xin Gongxin Inn on the 16th pier. Their situation is extremely miserable, and they deeply hope for assistance from all sectors.</p>
<h3>Steamboat Stewards Take Joint Responsibility Guarantee; Resolution of the Steamboat Industry Association</h3>
<p>Steamboat stewards often carry smuggled goods, evading not only customs duties but also freight charges. Since the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company first rectified the smuggling of small packages last year, annual revenue has increased by over 100,000 yuan. Furthermore, the Jianghai Customs has thoroughly investigated stewards' private carrying of goods, strictly stipulating fines and requiring the steamboat companies to be responsible. If smuggled highly poisonous materials are discovered, the penalty is death. After the promulgation of this regulation, steamboat companies, burdened with excessive responsibility, worried that unscrupulous stewards might engage in such activities, and once a case is cracked or a steward escapes, the steamboat companies would be unable to bear such a heavy responsibility. The steamboat companies submitted this case to the Municipal Shipping Association for discussion. The association has resolved that all steamboat stewards must take joint responsibility guarantee. Those already employed must submit supplementary joint responsibility guarantee forms, and the association will notify all steamboat companies to implement this uniformly. The original proposal is recorded below: "To all members, according to statements from member companies, since the Customs announced that 'seafarers and stewards carrying smuggled goods will be fined from 200 to 1,000 yuan, to be borne by the steamboat companies,' and Chairman Chiang issued Article 2 of the regulations strictly prohibiting highly poisonous materials, which states 'those who manufacture or transport highly poisonous materials will be sentenced to death,' the matter is extremely serious. If any seafarers or stewards carry such materials due to the lure of high profits, and the matter is exposed, the seafarers and stewards are employees of the steamboat companies. If the main culprit is at large, the companies must be investigated, which is an unbearable burden. To prevent such occurrences and reduce responsibility, a sound plan must be devised. Please devise a guarantee method.' The proposal was submitted to the 29th Executive Committee meeting on the 15th of this month, and it was resolved that 'the association should notify all members to adopt the joint responsibility guarantee method for seafarers and stewards to provide security and facilitate mutual supervision.' This record is issued as a notification, and we hope you will comply and not misinterpret. Sincerely, The Shanghai Steamboat Industry Association, March 18th."</p>
<h3>103 Chinese Ships Involved in Accidents Last Year; Ministry of Transportation Orders Shipping Companies to Carefully Select Crew Members; Collisions Account for the Majority of Accidents; 15 Ships Hijacked by Pirates</h3>
<p>Last year, 103 Chinese ships were involved in accidents, and 70-80% of them were ships sailing to and from Shanghai, setting a record unseen in the shipping industry in recent years. This resulted in significant losses for ship insurance companies last year. The Ministry of Transportation has summarized the causes of the accidents involving the 103 ships and issued instructions to Shanghai, noting that collisions accounted for the majority of accidents, including Hongxing, Tonghua, Xinrenhe, Tongshang, Puan, and 25 others. The most tragic incident was a small ship in Fuzhou where over 40 passengers died. Eight ships ran aground, including Fulong, Yuanshun, Jinglong, Tianxiang, and others. Sunken ships included Zhaoxing, Fuyuan, Yuli, Xinhongyuan, Haiping, and others. Fires occurred on Huitong, Daqing, Xingshi, Xinfeng, Ruihua, and others. Fifteen ships were hijacked by pirates, including Puan, Xinbaohe, Linpu, Yaobei, Shunfa, Chuanshan, Lishun, He'an, Jiahe, Xinhaiwen, Hengji, Daishan, Tongan, Tailai, and Longsheng. Groundings and engine failures were even more frequent. The accidents, sinkings, and pirate attacks involving foreign ships are not included. In summary, the accidents involving merchant ships are mainly due to natural disasters and human error. The dereliction of duty of crew members is particularly numerous. Learning from the past and being mindful of future disasters, the ministry has ordered all shipping companies to pay special attention to the skills of the crew members they hire and not to allow unqualified individuals to fill positions, leading to tragedies at sea.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Lawyers Association; Ministry Approves Temporary Continuation of Committee System Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association was ordered by the Ministry of Judicial Administration last year to amend its constitution. Several general meetings of members were convened, but all failed to reach a quorum, resulting in adjourned meetings. Some members suggested submitting a request to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for permission to maintain the committee system. However, due to the failure to hold a general meeting, the matter was delayed until now. Recently, members Wu Guochang, Wang Youling, Dong Kang, Yu Zhongluo, Shan Yuhua, Wang Weizhen, Shi Liang, Li Shirui, Tang Yingsong, Tan Yigong, Wu Yinwu, Cha Renwei, Zhao Zuwei, Wang Lu, Wang Xiaowen, Ruan Ducheng, Wei Weiqing, Yin Ruxiong, and over 170 others, citing the special circumstances of Shanghai, proposed submitting a request to the ministry to maintain the provisions of the temporary constitution regarding the committee system. The association submitted the proposal to a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees, which passed the proposal. The association then submitted a document to the Ministry of Judicial Administration requesting the maintenance of the committee system provisions of the temporary constitution. Yesterday, the approval from the Ministry of Judicial Administration was received, stating: "We have received your submission and the attached proposal. Since Shanghai has special circumstances, the committee system is temporarily approved until the Lawyers Law is enacted. A copy of this approval is filed." After receiving the ministry's order, the association decided to convene the 193rd joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committees to schedule a spring general meeting to re-elect the executive and supervisory committees.</p>

<h3>1933 Customs Treasury Bill Exchange Method; Can Entrust Central Bank and Other Banks to Exchange</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance believes that the number of 10,000 yuan Customs Treasury Bills from 1933 is very large. To facilitate circulation, it has formulated a method for exchanging 10,000 yuan bills for 1,000 yuan bills. The Ministry of Finance will issue a public announcement and begin implementing the method on the 26th of this month. The following is an excerpt of the method:</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Announcement</p>
<p>Announcement No. 84 of the Ministry of Finance states: "To facilitate the circulation of the 1933 Customs Treasury Bills, the Ministry has approved the exchange of 10,000 yuan bills for 1,000 yuan bills and designated the Shanghai office of the Ministry's Public Debt Division at 452 Jiangxi Road to be responsible for managing the exchange. The method will be published in the newspaper on March 26, 1935 for public awareness. This announcement is hereby made."</p>
<p>Exchange Method</p>
<p>(1) To facilitate circulation, the Ministry of Finance approves the exchange of 10,000 yuan bills for 1,000 yuan bills and assigns the Public Debt Division's Shanghai office to be responsible for managing the exchange. (2) The Ministry of Finance originally printed 2,000 10,000 yuan bills for a total face value of 20,000,000 yuan. 20,000 1,000 yuan bills will be reprinted with a total face value of 20,000,000 yuan, numbered from A00001 to A20000, for holders to exchange. (3) The Ministry of Finance will publish a notice in the newspaper that all holders of the 10,000 yuan Customs Treasury Bills may exchange one 10,000 yuan bill for ten 1,000 yuan bills at the designated exchange office within the prescribed time limit. (4) For 10,000 yuan bills circulating in various locations, the exchange office will send letters to the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications in various locations, requesting that they forward any bills submitted by holders to the Shanghai office for processing. The postage fees will be paid by the holders. (5) The exchange office will list the amount of bills exchanged daily, report them in detail, punch holes in the exchanged bills to invalidate them, and record the last two digits of the serial number for submission to the National Debt Foundation for record keeping. (6) The exchange office will store the 10,000 yuan bills collected daily in the custody of the Gold Management Committee. After accumulating a sufficient amount, the office will request that the Ministry of Finance send personnel to inspect and destroy them. (7) The Ministry of Finance may amend or supplement this method at any time if there are any omissions.</p>
<h3>People's Whereabouts</h3>
<p>Kong Xishe, Yang Dezhao, Qin Zhen, and Fu Rusen departed Beijing last night on the night express and arrived in Shanghai this morning.</p>
<p>He Yaozu departed on the night train to Beijing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Mayor Wu Declines Building a Commemorative Pavilion; Constructing a Bronze Statue of Chairman Chiang Alone</h3>
<p>Various sectors in Shanghai initiated the establishment of a bronze statue of Chairman Chiang and a commemorative pavilion for Mayor Wu. Participating groups were very enthusiastic. Now Mayor Wu has repeatedly declined the construction of the pavilion and requested the cancellation of the previous resolution. The Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Association has also expressed the same opinion. The association issued a notice yesterday stating, "Regarding the announcement, the Shanghai Municipal Government has repeatedly sent personnel to our association to explain that Mayor Wu himself does not require a commemorative pavilion. Therefore, the previous resolution should be cancelled and a statue of Chairman Chiang should be built instead." In accordance with the spirit of Wu Hua's will, the Guangdong Shanghai Fellow Association's letter suggested that the commemorative pavilion for the mayor be removed. Because Mayor Wu has declined repeatedly, it is difficult to force him. To respect the mayor's wishes, the construction of the city's commemorative pavilion will be temporarily suspended. The preparations for the construction of Chairman Chiang's statue will continue actively. The name of the association will be changed to "Shanghai All Circles Establishing Chiang Kai-shek Bronze Statue Temporary Preparation Office." In addition to reporting the matter to the inaugural meeting and sending letters to the municipal government for review and response, this notice is hereby issued.</p>
<h3>Municipal Chamber of Commerce Writes to Niter and Sulfur Bureau; Requesting Compliance with the Flying Flowers Purchase Sulfur Agreement</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce wrote to the Jiangsu Niter and Sulfur Bureau and the Niter and Sulfur Transportation and Sales Office yesterday regarding the issue of flying flower factories purchasing niter and sulfur: "Previously, flying flower factories needed niter and sulfur and would apply for passports to purchase it themselves. Later, the requirement was changed to purchase it through the Niter and Sulfur Bureau. Our association submitted a petition and obtained approval No. 169 from the Ministry of Military Affairs, allowing our association to be responsible for providing certification and submitting it to the ministry for passport issuance." As the Jiangsu Provincial Niter and Sulfur Transportation and Sales Office believed this matter would hinder their business, they asked our association to mediate. If the industry could purchase it through them, they were willing to reduce their profits. Therefore, based on this principle, our association's former chairman Wang Maolai, the Jiangsu Provincial Niter and Sulfur Transportation and Sales Office representative Guan Zhi, Xu Peiruo, the Flying Flower Industry Association representatives Xie Zhongle, Gu Wenchao, Shi Shenfu, the Huang Jinrong representative Wang Riku, and the notary Song Kangfu signed a 13-article agreement, which was made in quadruplicate. Each party held one copy, and our association submitted one copy to the Ministry of Military Affairs for record. According to Article 12 of the agreement, it would be in effect forever from the date of signing. Article 13 states that the agreement cannot be changed without mutual consent. Therefore, the agreement has become a powerful contract. It cannot be changed unilaterally due to changes in personnel. The industry association has sworn not to accept the request to renegotiate, aiming to maintain the contract. We hereby inform you and hope that you will comply and allow them to proceed according to the original agreement. We hope that you will not make any changes.</p>
<h3>Wutung Railway Route Goods Exhibition Opening Imminent, Anhui Construction Department Urges Manufacturers' Association to Expedite Preparations</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chinese Domestic Manufacturers' United Association, having previously received an invitation from the Anhui Provincial Government to participate in the Wutung Railway line goods exhibition, has been preparing and is now nearly ready. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Anhui Construction Department Letter: The association received a letter and telegram from the Anhui Provincial Construction Department yesterday, stating in the "Letter": "This province is organizing a mobile exhibition of goods along the Wutung Railway line, and we are deeply grateful for your association's enthusiastic participation, widespread exhibits, and dispatch of Mr. Zhou Zhaolin to Anhui to survey the exhibition site and prepare for the event. The association is scheduled to open on April 1st in Wuhu, without any postponement, and will move the preparatory committee to Wuhu for office work on the 15th of this month. We hope you will inform Mr. Zhou to travel to Wuhu as soon as possible to jointly prepare and provide guidance to ensure perfection. The duty-free certificate and railway and shipping discount vouchers have been signed and issued to Anhui by the Ministry of Industry. Please send a letter to the Provincial Government indicating the number of copies your association requires." "Telegram": "Addressed to Mr. Zhou Zhaolin: The Wutung Railway Exhibition Preparatory Committee has begun office work in Wuhu. Please come to Wuhu immediately to jointly prepare. Construction Department."</p>
<p>Manufacturers' Reply: "Respectfully, we received your department's letter No. 625 and telegram, requesting that our association send Zhou Zhaolin to Wuhu to assist in preparing for the Wutung Railway line goods exhibition. We have taken careful note. Mr. Zhou Zhaolin went to Wuhu on the 9th of this month to survey the site and returned to Shanghai on the 11th. He was preparing to write a plan when he was suddenly dispatched to Shaoxing on official business. According to a letter received yesterday, he cannot return to Shanghai immediately. Therefore, our association decided to appoint another commissioner at tomorrow's (i.e., today's) executive meeting to come to Wuhu to jointly prepare. (Omission) We are currently sending personnel to solicit participation from manufacturers in various places. May we request a one-week postponement of the opening to facilitate the gathering of as many participants as possible? If the opening date cannot be postponed, the exhibits of the Shanghai manufacturers who have already joined will be shipped from Shanghai on March 25th and 26th. We need approximately five copies each of the duty-free certificate and discount voucher. Please expedite their delivery by mail so that the opening can proceed as scheduled. We are sending this letter for your review."</p>
<h3>Trucking Industry: Soliciting $100,000 for Aviation Donations, Fresh Pork Industry Association Joins as a Group Member</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Solicitation Team Headquarters of the Chinese Aviation Association, in order to widely solicit donations for aviation to save the country, previously sent a letter to the Trucking Industry Association, soliciting aviation donations. After receiving the letter, the association convened a special temporary executive meeting yesterday to discuss the solicitation of aviation donations. Zhang Yuliang from the Team Headquarters attended and reported. Over ten executive committee members attended, including Lou Yinchuan, Chen Tongzhi, Hu Xiangsheng, Xu Youji, Jiang Zhongying, Yuan Wanji, Chen Quangen, Yang Shunji, Jiang Shuji, Sun Deshou, Shao Xiaoli, and Ge Aishi. Chaired by Lou Yinchuan, the meeting resolved to solicit aviation donations. All trucks used for transporting goods in the city will be charged $6 per month per vehicle, aiming to raise $100,000. The Team Headquarters will determine the start date for the solicitation. It is evident that the industry is generally enthusiastic about supporting the aviation to save the country movement, and it is hoped that other industries will follow suit and work together.</p>
<p>The Fresh Pork Industry Association sent a letter to the Team Headquarters yesterday, joining as a group member and paying a membership fee of $50.</p>
<p>Team leader Pan Yangyao of Team 30, team leader Gu Jiwu of Team 343, team leader Yao Mulian of Team 42, and team leader Tang Haian of Team 34 previously requested hundreds of copies of membership forms and badges, as well as various solicitation documents, due to insufficient distribution.

Team leader Yunshan of Team 252 requested the appointment of Zhao Shibei, Wang Simao, Chen Beisan, Li Liang, and Zhang Chaozuo, among seventeen others, as deputy team leaders. It is reported that the Team Headquarters has sent appointment letters and issued appointment certificates separately to assist in the process.</p>
<h3>Chinese Red Cross Society Sends a Large Batch of Refugees Back to Their Hometowns</h3>
<p>The Shanghai headquarters of the Chinese Red Cross Society on Jiujiang Road received a report yesterday from Zhou Juwen, chairman of the Songting branch, on the process of accommodating refugees and requesting assistance with transportation to send them back to their hometowns for resettlement. Due to the drought in Zhejiang Province last year, there was no harvest in Haining, Xiashi, and other places. Groups of people went to Songjiang. The Songjiang branch of the association established a shelter in Chao Guo Temple, accommodating approximately 5,000 refugees. The shelter operated for over a month, with the headquarters allocating rice three times, totaling 320 bags, and local philanthropists sponsoring materials and money. It has been decided to send 1,500 male and female disaster victims from Haining County back to their hometowns, requesting the chairmen of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces to consult with the Ministry of Railways to allocate free carriages for transportation. The Ministry has instructed the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration to comply, and it is approved to dispatch 20 carriages tomorrow, with personnel escorting them to Haining.</p>
<h3>Standing Committee of the All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association</h3>
<p>Passed Important Motions</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Jiaxu Drought Disaster Relief Association convened its 25th standing committee meeting yesterday afternoon. Over twenty people attended, including Shen Zhi, Yu Zhongxian, Wang Yiting, Zhuang Qing, Xu Xinliu, Chu Huizeng, Qu Wenliu, and Gu Xinyi, to discuss the spring relief measures proposed by committee member Yu Zhongxian. It was resolved that the first point would be the same as the association's original plan, and the second point would be handled as discussed. The association should send personnel to inspect and accept the completed work relief projects.</p>
<p>Spring Relief Plan: Yu Zhongxian's proposed spring relief plan: (1) Each county in the spring relief plan should use work as a means of relief. The main body of operation is in each county, so the association does not need to send a large number of personnel to each county as in winter relief. This time, one person can be sent to each county, and the title can be designated as the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Disaster Relief Association's work relief supervisor in a certain county, assisting officials and gentry in each county. This can save expenses and avoid the drawbacks of exclusive and isolated actions that do not conform to local public opinion. (2) Each county's work relief, whether dredging rivers or building dikes, must be examined and verified to accumulate merits. The association should elect one person from the standing committee for each county to inspect and accept the construction in each county after the construction begins, to show solemnity and prevent corruption. All expenses for the inspections will be self-provided.</p>
<p>Work Relief Outline: The association's work relief outline: (1) The county government should select key projects in each disaster area and design micro-projects. Anyone with the ability to work, regardless of gender, can apply. (2) The project plan should not be too large and should be directly related to farmland water conservancy, such as dredging branch rivers and small ports, raising embankment shores, and repairing ditches and weirs. Disaster victims doing work should be recruited nearby. (3) Relief rice should be distributed, calculated at one liter of rice per cubic foot, or two liters of rice per work unit.

<h3>Li Heshang, Sentenced to Life Imprisonment, Withdraws Appeal</h3>
<p>Voluntarily Enters Prison to Spend His Remaining Years</p>
<p>Li Heshang, a young man from Nanhui, 27 years old, worked as a servant for a Western family at No. 247, Lane 261, Route des Sœurs in the French Concession. His mistress, Li Yu, 25 years old, from Suzhou, worked as a cook in the same house. Li had a friend and colleague named Jin Kui, who was scheduled to get married in the first month of the lunar calendar this year. Lacking funds to make new clothes, on the afternoon of the 9th of this month, at about 4 p.m., he asked Li to hold a weapon and go to No. 3 Shanzhong Road, the Dazhonghua Coal Ball Distribution Office, to rob. They stole twelve small dollars and fled separately. Li escaped on a bicycle with a gun, heading west along Haig Road. The victim, Xu Guochang, chased after them and shouted for help. Li fled to the Zhao Zhujiao Road intersection, where he encountered a police officer No. 4, who heard the alarm and helped chase them to the Route des Sœurs intersection. Another police officer, No. 192, heard the alarm and rushed to intercept them. Li shot at the officer, killing No. 192. At the same time, Li was shot and wounded in the right leg by police officer No. 434, who returned fire. Li fled back to his employer's house and told his employer that he had been chased by the police and injured by stray bullets on the road. He asked his employer to send him to the hospital for treatment. His employer reported to the French police by phone, and Detective Zhou Buguang and others rushed to arrest Li, seizing a pistol, a bicycle, and a coat with bullet holes. Li's mistress, Yu, and his accomplice, Sun Linwen, were also arrested for helping to hide the gun and destroy evidence. They were sent to the First Special Court for prosecution on charges of robbery and murder. After the trial by Judge Zhang Chaozuo, Li Heshang was sentenced to nine years of imprisonment for carrying a weapon and committing robbery in a gang, two years of imprisonment for possessing military firearms, and life imprisonment for attempting to escape punishment by committing murder, with deprivation of civil rights for life. The life imprisonment was to be enforced. Li Yu and Sun Linwen were each sentenced to four months of imprisonment for helping to destroy evidence, with a three-year suspended sentence. The details have been reported in previous newspapers. Li Heshang was dissatisfied with the verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court, hoping to reduce his sentence. Based on the appeal, the High Court opened a preliminary investigation court yesterday morning, presided over by Judge Xiong Ping, and ordered the police to bring the prisoner Li to the court for questioning from the detention center. Li had learned the pros and cons of the case in the detention center and feared that the appeal would result in a heavier sentence. Therefore, after the judge questioned him about his name, age, place of residence, and occupation, and asked him about his reasons for appealing against the original judgment, Li suddenly requested to withdraw his appeal and expressed his willingness to be sent to prison immediately to spend his remaining years. The court approved the request and ordered him to sign the request record. The judge ordered the bailiffs to take Li down and temporarily return him to custody, pending execution of the sentence.</p>
<h3>Mother Sues After Daughter is Raped, Doctor Examines Daughter and Finds She Was Not a Virgin, Case Concerns Public Morality and Declared Closed to the Public</h3>
<p>Cao Xu, an old woman from Yangzhou residing at No. 430 Avenue Edward VII in the Public Concession, is 50 years old and has a daughter named Yuying, 15 years old, of average appearance. On the afternoon of the 17th of this month, she was lured out by Hua Jiakun, a hairdresser from the same hometown residing at No. 236 Rue Mabilie, 20 years old. Hua Jiakun enticed the girl to the New China Inn at 96 Route Wagner in the French Concession, where they rented a room. Cao Xu searched everywhere after her daughter went missing and only found her the following afternoon. After learning the truth from her daughter, she was shocked and found Hua to confront him. She then took him to the Avenue Edward VII New Gate Patrol Station to seek justice. After questioning, the head constable determined that the crime scene was in the French Concession and sent the two parties to the French Police Station for investigation. According to the victim Cao Yuying, she confessed that on the 17th, she was doing laundry at home when Hua Jiakun called her out to visit the Great World amusement park. She was taken to the inn and stayed overnight, where she was raped three times. She said she had known Hua for about two months. Hua confessed that he had known Cao Yuying for about three months and that she voluntarily went with him to the New China Inn, where they stayed in Room 2 and had sex four times. Based on the confession, the head constable ordered Hua to be detained and sent Detective Zhang Dongcheng to investigate. The girl was sent to Guangci Hospital for medical examination. The result was that there were no signs of rape, indicating that the girl was not a virgin. Yesterday, the police sent Hua Jiakun to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, where he was tried by Judge Li Changnian. Police lawyer Yuan Jiahuang stated the case and filed a charge of disturbing public morals. The court declared the case closed to the public because it concerned public morals. After the audience left, the victim Cao Yuying and the defendant Hua Jiakun were questioned for a long time. The court ordered a change of date for another hearing and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody. The victim was also ordered to undergo a medical examination by the forensic department for verification.</p>
<h3>Wang Xinghua is Young and Ignorant, Deceived While Visiting the Park</h3>
<p>Divorced her Original Husband and Came to Shanghai to Marry, Jin Congzhou Pretended to be Devoted, Then Disappeared</p>
<p>Wang Xinghua, a woman from Huzhou, Zhejiang, 21 years old, lived in the countryside. When she was 17 years old, she married Yao Hanqing from the same hometown. Last summer, she came to Shanghai from her hometown due to some matters. One day, she was visiting the Bund Park when Jin Congzhou, a bank custodian from Anhui at No. 97 Renji Road, Central Trust of China Bank, (already 50 years old), also happened to be in the park. He was amazed by Wang's beauty and immediately started to seduce her with sweet words, boasting about his background and claiming that his original wife had passed away and he needed someone to take care of his household. He expressed his desire to marry Wang and take care of the family. Wang was moved but told him that she already had a husband. Jin Congzhou encouraged Wang to break off the relationship with her husband. From then on, Jin wrote to Yao Hanqing, luring him to Shanghai on the pretext of finding him a job. He then forced Wang to divorce Yao and promised to compensate Yao a considerable amount of money. At this time, Wang was already deeply infatuated with him and, being young and ignorant, did not consider the consequences and followed Jin's advice, divorcing Yao. From then on, Wang was exclusively occupied by Jin. Jin thought that Wang Xinghua's name was not elegant and changed it to Jin Fugui and Su Zhen. Therefore, Wang went by the name of Jin Fugui. During last year's Mid-Autumn Festival, Jin Congzhou rented a room in the Cosmopolitan Hotel on Avenue Edward VII as a new home and hosted a banquet for relatives and friends. They also lived together at No. 97 Gulou Ridge Road and took a photo together at the Metropolitan Photography Studio to commemorate the occasion. Before two months had passed, they moved to No. 32 Zhizhong Lane, Xizilaihuo Street in the French Concession. To please Wang Xinghua, he personally wrote "Jin Fugui" on pillowcases and handkerchiefs. After another month, on December 17th of last year, he disappeared without a trace. Wang then realized that she had been deceived and hired lawyer Zhang Chenglin to file a lawsuit in the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court against Jin Congzhou for violating Article 244 of the Criminal Law, disturbing public morals, requesting that he be summoned for investigation, and seeking 30,000 yuan in alimony as an attached civil suit. The First Special Court had summoned the defendant once, but he did not appear. The court ordered a change of date. Yesterday, Presiding Judge Feng Shide summoned the defendant again, but he still could not be found. After briefly questioning the plaintiff, the court decided to suspend the trial proceedings.</p>

Later, due to unequal distribution of spoils, they shot and killed their accomplice Xiao Jin Dou and attempted to shoot and kill Zhang Yongshui, but failed. After the case was discovered, the Public Security Bureau's Detective Team arrested the four criminals and escorted them to the local court.

Victims Ren Qingyun and Li Songlin identified Wang Abao as the person who carried a handgun to threaten and rob them. Victim Yue Wenming identified Li Liying as the person who directed the robbery with a gun. Hu Mei identified Xu Fating as the person who first broke into the house with a gun. In total, they committed seven robberies and shot and killed Xiao Jinbao and attempted to shoot and kill Zhang Yongan. The defendants confessed to the crimes. Prosecutor Lei charged the defendants with jointly and continuously committing robbery, which had been clearly established. It was also discovered that Wang Abao had been sentenced to 12 years in prison by the First Special Court for previous crimes. He filed a lawsuit in the Criminal Court. Judge Zhang Shao specially opened the Fifth Court yesterday morning to try the case. The four criminals, Wang Abao, Xu Fating, Yang Liying, and Shen Rongtian, were brought to court. They all confessed to being from Haizhou, either coppersmiths, rickshaw pullers, or laborers. They admitted to committing the crimes and requested leniency. Prosecutor Lei delivered a closing argument, requesting that the defendants be severely punished according to the law to reassure the public.

Therefore, this newspaper visited Dr. Chen Fangzhi, a graduate of Tokyo Imperial University, at the Shanghai Medical Association.

He learned that Indichi is not a professor at the Imperial University but a practicing physician in Aoyama Minamimachi, Akasaka Ward, Tokyo.

<h3>Maid Cries "Thief!" Master Falls and Is Injured</h3>
<p>At No. 4 Dalianfang, Lutangshan Road, Dalian, the residence of Chang Jishi (over seventy years old), an accountant from Changzhou at the Zhengtai Rubber Factory, four robbers suddenly swarmed into the house around 0:45 yesterday afternoon. Two of the robbers, holding guns, threatened the homeowner to keep silent. At that time, Chang happened to be upstairs and, upon hearing the maid shout "Thief!", became anxious and jumped from the roof of the garret in an attempt to escape. The robbers, realizing that things were going badly, quickly overturned boxes and chests, taking away soft valuables and clothing. Upon learning of this, the nearby Huishan police station dispatched a large number of detectives to rush to the scene to apprehend the robbers, but they had already fled. It is said that Chang recently lost a younger brother and had just held a funeral, which led to the gangsters' covetousness. Chang suffered injuries to his hands, legs, and other parts of his body, which were quite severe. He was immediately sent to the hospital for treatment. The police station is currently compiling information on the robbers to bring them to justice.</p>

<h3>Examination Results: Yao Jinping Is Still a Virgin</h3>
<p>Truth Revealed About the Question of a Woman Turning into a Man</p>
<p>Anxious to See Her Father, Fearing Many Inconveniences of a Long Journey</p>
<p>...General Li Du Promises to Help Her Return to Tianjin for School and Provide Living Expenses for Many Years...</p>
<p>Since the discovery of the case of Tianjin woman Yao Jinping turning into a man, not only has the whole country been in an uproar, but even foreigners in China, such as Mr. Fei Bai, the police superintendent of the French Concession, have been eager to see Yao in person. In particular, it has aroused deep concern among the medical community, all of whom hope to conduct an on-site examination to clarify the truth. Therefore, at the suggestion of General Li Du, he contacted Yan Fuqing, the president of the National Shanghai Medical College (formerly the Red Cross) at 363 Haige Road, by telephone three nights ago. Mr. Yan also believed that this unprecedented physiological change was of real research value to medicine, so he expressed his welcome. Thus, at about 4:00 p.m. the day before yesterday (the 19th), General Li himself, accompanied by his secretary Zheng Yucun, took Yao Jinping and her grandfather Qing Bingri in his own car from Li's residence in Jing'an Villa directly to the medical college. President Yan, to be cautious, specially summoned Dr. Gao Rimei, director of the Department of Urology and Reproductive Medicine, and Dr. Wang Yihui, director of the Department of Obstetrics, to be responsible for a precise examination to determine the truth. However, because the examination was complicated and would require at least two days in the hospital to complete, her grandfather accompanied her to the hospital and a special first-class room, No. 29 on the second floor, was set up. Details have been recorded in this newspaper. Yesterday was the second day of Yao's admission to the hospital, but something unexpected happened. Yesterday afternoon, a reporter happened to visit a friend at a certain place, and Mr. Hu, a well-known insurance professional, was present. When he saw the reporter, he smiled and said, "Do you know the results of Yao Jinping's examination today?" The reporter replied, "Not yet." Mr. Hu continued (the following is all Mr. Hu's words): "This morning (that is, yesterday), I went to the Red Cross on Haige Road to visit a sick friend. When I arrived, it was already about 11:00 a.m. After talking with my friend for about ten minutes, I suddenly heard people whispering outside the room. Listening carefully, they were talking about Yao's examination. So I inquired carefully. According to a nurse, 'Just now, our doctor ordered Yao to take off her lower trousers to inspect her, but Yao refused. Although the doctor repeatedly persuaded her gently, Yao still refused. At this time, the doctors discussed it again in secret and then used a kind of irresistible drug to make Yao fall asleep on the bed and accept the examination. It turned out that Yao was a complete woman. The transformation was purely fabricated.'" Hearing this, the reporter walked to the door of Room 29 and peeked inside. He saw a person on the bed, seemingly sleeping soundly and not yet awake, and an old man sitting beside her, presumably Yao's grandfather. After hearing this, the reporter drove to the hospital at 9:00 p.m. to inquire, but the staff in the hospital were tight-lipped, only saying that Yao Jinping and her grandfather had indeed been sent back to Li's residence in Jing'an Villa by car from the hospital at about 5:00 p.m. this afternoon (yesterday) and handed over to General Li Du.</p>
<p>In order to be cautious, this newspaper telephoned General Li Du late at night. General Li told the truth (the following are all General Li's words): "In order to clarify the truth about Yao Jinping's transformation from a woman to a man, I specially obtained the consent of President Yan Fuqing of the National Shanghai Medical College and personally sent Yao and her grandfather to the hospital yesterday (that is, the day before yesterday). President Yan attached great importance to this matter and specially invited six doctors (two Westerners and four Chinese) to conduct a joint examination at about 9:00 a.m. today (yesterday). However, Yao refused from beginning to end. Finally, the doctor used anesthetic to put Yao to sleep. The examination showed that she was completely female. After the doctor obtained the results, he telephoned me at about 11:00 a.m. I rushed over and questioned Yao about why she did this. Yao immediately cried and told General Li that she was anxious to go to Xinjiang to find her father, but feared that there would be many inconveniences for a woman on a long journey, so she had no choice but to do this, and asked General Li to forgive her." General Li felt sorry for her and immediately took her back to his residence, asking her grandfather how much household living expenses he needed each year. Yao's grandfather replied that 300 yuan was enough. General Li immediately generously promised to subsidize 300 yuan each year and instructed Yao Jinping not to go to Xinjiang, but to return to Tianjin to go to school, and that he would continue to subsidize all her tuition fees. As for the whereabouts of her father in Xinjiang, he also promised to try to investigate.</p>
<h3>Tongchang Car Company Uses Photos for Advertising Miss Lu Ping Sues Zhu Tongsheng</h3>
<p>Spreading Images Related to Her Reputation</p>
<p>Demanding Compensation for Damages and Destruction of Publications</p>
<p>Lu Ping, a 23-year-old woman from Wuxi and an employee in the cosmetics department of the Xielong Trading Company at 459 North Henan Road, has received considerable education. Recently, she discovered that the Tongchang Car Company at the intersection of Yunnan Road and Nanjing Road had published her portrait in various daily newspapers and magazines, accompanied by a car rental advertisement, without her consent. Therefore, she believes that this constitutes an act of spreading obscene images and harming her reputation. She has hired lawyer Zhang Ding to file a criminal self-accusation with the First Special Court against Zhu Tongsheng, the owner of Tongchang Car Company, and Mao Keming, the director of the advertising department. The main points of her accusation are as follows: The self-accuser is an employee of Xielong Trading Company and has little social interaction. Recently, someone told her that her portrait had been found in various daily newspapers, books, pamphlets, and printed materials, in large numbers. She then searched for and identified many of them, confirming that they were indeed made by Zhu Tongsheng, the owner of Tongchang Car Company. As a woman, the self-accuser is neither an important person nor a high-ranking official, and the circulation of her portrait will not inspire respect, but will only demean her personality, make her vulnerable to frivolousness, and cause misunderstandings, which is related to her reputation. Therefore, she asked a lawyer to send a letter notifying them to immediately stop printing any unprinted daily newspapers, recall and cancel those that had already been issued, and publish an apology in the newspaper. However, the defendants refused and claimed that Mao Keming had obtained her consent to take the photos beforehand. Although Mao is a friend of the self-accuser's husband and occasionally went out for a stroll and took photos in Zhaofeng Garden, he did not explain that they would be used for Tongchang advertisements. Therefore, the defendants' use of the self-accuser's image to spread it to the public constitutes a crime under Article 325, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. In addition to compensation for damages, she reserves the right to take further action and demands that the defendants be found guilty, that the printed images be destroyed, that no further publications be made in various books and newspapers, and that the judgment be published in the newspaper at the defendants' expense according to law. Yesterday afternoon, judge Zhan Liangce presided over the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Mao Keming failed to appear after being summoned, while Zhu Tongsheng appeared in court with his lawyer Jiang Yiping. The self-accuser Lu Ping stated the previous circumstances of her complaint and stated that Mao Kepeng, a friend of her husband, invited her by telephone to take photos in Zhaofeng Garden and other places twice between July and August last year. Each time, there was a rented car beside her. At that time, she thought they were just ordinary game photos and did not pay attention. She did not know that Mao had published the photos in various newspapers and magazines as advertisements, which was a real harm to her reputation. She asked to be investigated and presented the newspapers and "Life Quick View," as well as the Rongji Da Wuhai commemorative special edition, to the court through her lawyer Zhang Ding. Zhu Tongsheng confessed that Mao Keming was previously the advertising director in my car company and has now resigned. When these photos were taken, I was not in Shanghai. Afterwards, when I read the newspaper, I asked Mao, and Mao said that the photos were published with the consent of Ms. Lu herself. Then, lawyer Jiang Yiping stood up and presented various pieces of evidence, saying that the self-accuser had taken photos with Mao Keming a total of five times, each time with a rented car beside her, sitting and standing in different positions, which was obviously with her consent. Now, because Mao's business was closed, the self-accuser came to court to file a lawsuit, and there are other relationships involved. There are witnesses who can prove it. Then, witnesses Li Afu and Zhao Asan filed a case and confessed that they were Tongchang's car drivers and proved that Mao Keming had repeatedly taken Ms. Lu to the racecourse road and Zhaofeng Garden by chartered car or motorcycle on August 31, September 2, and September 5 to take photos, all of which were voluntary, but they did not know what they were for. Judge Zhan reviewed the confession and, since Mao had not arrived, ordered the case to be adjourned until the 27th afternoon to summon Mao Keming to the court for further questioning.</p>
<h3>Long-Separated Wives Fight Over Property in Court</h3>
<p>Mediation Fails</p>
<p>Court Orders Sentence to Be Pronounced on a Scheduled Date</p>
<p>Li Huidong, the grandson of Li Chaozhang, a major official in the Qing Dynasty's revitalization, also died many years ago. His concubine, Ms. Xie, had a poor relationship with Li Chen, the main wife, and Li Ding, Huidong's mother. Therefore, they lived separately in Lai'anfang, Xinzha Road, and did not communicate with each other. Recently, Ms. Xie believed that the property left by Huidong had been sold off by the Ding and Chen in-laws one after another, and that her livelihood was not being taken care of. It was difficult to remain silent any longer. She commissioned lawyer Chen Tingrui to send a letter of inquiry, stating that she was a member of the Huidong family, and that since the deceased's estate had been disposed of by your in-laws, you should be responsible for supporting her. Please negotiate a solution quickly after receiving the letter, otherwise, she would have to resort to the law to seek relief. Although the Ding and Chen parties subsequently conducted negotiations with Ms. Sun, one party demanded a minimum of 30,000 yuan for living expenses, while the other party was only willing to give two or three thousand yuan. The distance was too great to reach a peaceful solution. Lawyer Chen, representing Li Xie, submitted a presentation to the Civil Mediation Office of the First Special District Court, requesting mediation, but the result was still a breakdown. Therefore, she filed a lawsuit for alimony, claiming that she was forty years old, lonely, and had no way to seek support. If things continued in this way, how could she live? She requested that the defendants Li Ding and Li Chen jointly pay alimony of 30,000 yuan. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Zhang Zuolan opened a court session to summon the defendants. Li Ding was old and Li Chen claimed to be ill, so neither of them appeared in court. However, Ms. Li Zhuqi, Chen's daughter-in-law, appeared in court with her lawyer. The plaintiff, Li Xie, stated the purpose of the lawsuit, as well as the type, amount, and location of the remaining property, generally saying that the house on Xinzha Road had already been sold, with a price of 170,000 yuan. She only received five thousand taels of silver. In addition, as far as she knew, the defendant still held 30,000 yuan of Pacific Bank stock, as well as a large plot of land on Baohua Mountain in Nanjing. Later, the lawyers for the plaintiff and defendant debated each other to the end. Judge Zhang kindly persuaded both parties to reconcile, but it took a long time and did not work. He then ordered them to withdraw and wait for a scheduled sentence.</p>
<h3>Habitual Thief Wants to Get Rich, Steals Airline Tickets and Flees</h3>
<p>Mao Chengli's Greed Is Aroused</p>
<p>Yu Qingfeng's Partner Chases</p>
<p>Mao Chengli, 29 years old, from Ningbo, used to be a dock worker. Now, due to prolonged unemployment and economic hardship, he has no choice but to go out at night and sneak into shops and households to steal property to make a living. Mao heard people say that the aviation lottery tickets sold in the city's cigarette shops cost ten yuan each, and only cost one dollar per strip, but if you won the first prize, you could get a huge bonus of 500,000 yuan. The idea of getting rich arose spontaneously. Afterwards, Mao became a gold digger, thinking about buying lottery tickets day and night, but he suffered from not having money and lacking capital. At 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, Mao happened to pass by the entrance of Yu Qingfeng Cigarette Shop at No. 1, Dongjiadu, Nanshi. He suddenly saw that the counter of the shop was covered with aviation lottery tickets. The huge red characters of 500,000 yuan for the monthly first prize were hanging high on the wall. Mao paid attention to him there for a long time, and his eyes were dazzled by him. For a while, his mind was distracted. He saw that every lottery ticket could get 50,000 yuan, but he had no choice but to reach into his bag, and his pocket was empty. He regretted that he had more than enough heart but not enough strength. Before long, Mao suddenly had an idea, made his old trick, took advantage of the shop assistant's carelessness, reached into the cabinet, stole twelve aviation lottery tickets, and immediately turned around and ran away. He was seen by the shop assistant Huang Yongkang, who quickly took a step and chased him to the vicinity of Gongyi Wharf, where he was intercepted by Qiang Yuhua, the eleventh post guard, and searched for the original stolen goods. He was taken to the Dongjiadu Police Station under the jurisdiction of the station director, and Mao Chengli confessed that the reason I stole lottery tickets was nothing more than wanting to get rich. If I won the first prize, I would immediately become a rich man, and I could have cars and foreign houses as I wanted, and I could use my concubines and slaves as I wanted, and I would no longer have to be a thief and taste the wind, frost, rain and snow, and eat people's fists. Because the matter involved a theft case, he was ordered to prepare a document and send it to the bureau for investigation.</p>
<h3>Yan Zirong Plans Viciously One Woman Can't Be Married to Two</h3>
<p>Both Crimes Are Sent to the Court for Questioning</p>
<p>Yan Zirong, 50 years old, from Yangzhou, nicknamed "Old Candle," lives in a grass shed in Chongdeli, Renji Road, Pudong, and works as a dock worker. More than ten years ago, he had an affair with a woman. At that time, the woman brought a daughter named Guizhen, who has been living with her ever since. Now Guizhen is 20 years old. At the beginning of last year, she fell in love with Chen Yongfu's son Dexi, a fellow villager who opened a barber shop at No. 6 in the same neighborhood. At the beginning of last month, Guizhen suddenly disappeared, so Yan used his father's name to twist Dexi to the Pudong Public Security Bureau on the ninth of last month, accusing him of enticing his daughter, and Wang Xiuying, a woman from the same village, was brought to the case to prove that Guizhen was indeed hidden by Dexi. Later, the bureau sent both parties to the local court. After investigation, the court sentenced Dexi to six months in prison to serve as a warning, because the witness testimony was accurate. Dexi's father Yongfu felt uneasy because his son was imprisoned and suffered injustice. He spent money to hire two old women to search for Guizhen's whereabouts in various places every day, hoping that the truth would come out. But it was coincidental that the two old women recently passed through the Zhuangyuan area of ​​Hongkou and suddenly saw Guizhen performing in a circus troupe set up on the wasteland. They immediately returned to Pudong to report the news. Yongfu twisted Guizhen and Wang Sun, the female head of the circus troupe, to the relevant police station for investigation. At that time, Sun produced a marriage certificate, proving that Guizhen was sold to her son as his wife by her biological father Guo Guoyun, and Yu Chunxiang and Wang Guobao were matchmakers. It was agreed that the betrothal gift was 120 yuan, and 40 yuan had been paid. However, Wang turned the money over to Guizhen's stepfather Yan Zirong to collect it. Soon, the police station ruled that the case was a marital dispute and ordered that it not be dealt with. At this point, Yongfu realized that Yan had first conspired with Guizhen's former father to sell her at a price, and then falsely accused his son of trying to defraud him of his losses. So, he returned to Pudong and found Yan in a small teahouse on Dongchang Road at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. He first covered his head with a purse and reported to the police, and then took him to the Pudong Sub-bureau. During the pre-trial by the bureau chief, Yongfu stated that he had been framed by Yan, and discovered the behind-the-scenes events. He requested an investigation. According to Yan's confession, Guizhen was still enticed by the plaintiff's son. The bureau chief then sent the police to Hongkou to summon Wang Sun and Guizhen from the circus troupe together. According to Guizhen's confession, she was sold by her biological father and was not hidden by the plaintiff's son, and Sun confessed that the former father of Guizhen and the defendant had agreed to sell Guizhen to my son as his wife. The betrothal gift of 40 yuan was also received by the defendant. At this point, Director Zhang realized that Yan had planned viciously, framed good people, and made the plaintiff's son go to jail innocently. He was an extremely cunning and stubborn person. Just as he was about to send the case for investigation, the local court sent a subpoena, chasing the defendant Yan Zirong to ask questions. The reason was that a certain person named Jia from Taizhou accused Yan of first betrothing his daughter Guizhen to his son, and now he married Guizhen to the son of the circus owner. Please investigate the situation. Director Zhang believed that Yan had committed two crimes, one woman marrying two men, and he issued both crimes and ordered that a document be prepared and sent to the local court for joint investigation.</p>
<h3>Fugitive Criminal Fei Jinhai Has Been Captured</h3>
<p>Ni Lin, a woman from Hefei, Anhui, is 45 years old and lives in Shanghai as a domestic worker. At 8:00 p.m. on the first of this month, she poured sewage in front of No. 134, Pushi Road, in the French Concession, splashing pedestrians. The rascal nicknamed Xiao Zifan (that is, Fei Jinhai, a 20-year-old man from Chongming) scolded her. After that, Xiao Zifan joined forces with Zhang Xiaomao, a man from Haimen in the lane of Zhengwu Lane 25, Beidi E Road, and rushed to No. 134 Pushi Road to drag Kan Lin out and beat her, causing her serious injuries. The criminals fled the scene. After being injured, Lin slept in the shop of Fang Lao, a fellow villager at No. 53 Beidi E Road. The next morning, Lin died of her injuries. Fang Lin and Luo Geng, the shopkeepers, took Lin's body out and abandoned it in the Chunkuili Lane next door. Later, the French police found out about it and sent the body to the autopsy office for examination and burial by the court. They also sent detectives to arrest the criminals Zhang Xiaomao, Fang Lin, and Luo Geng, who were charged with the crimes of causing death by injury and abandoning the body. However, the main criminal Xiao Zifan was on the run and could not be arrested. The police station ordered that he be arrested. The three persons Zhang Xiaomao, Fang Lin, and Luo Geng were interrogated by Court President Shi Gangxu of the Second Special Court the day before yesterday and a verdict was scheduled for the 25th. On the 19th, at 6:00 p.m., Bao Tan Tian Shiqing of the French police arrested Xiao Zifan, that is, Fei Jinhai, on Minguo Road outside Xiaodongmen, and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday, he was sent to Criminal Court 1 of the First Special Court for interrogation by Judge Li Changnian. Lawyer Yuan Jiahuan of the police station said that the defendant Fei Jinhai was a fugitive in a case of causing death by joint injury and was arrested yesterday. He requested a postponement to the 25th to try him with Zhang Xiaomao and others. The court核谕 asked the defendant briefly and then ordered a postponement to the 25th to try him with Zhang Xiaomao. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Youth Killed in Revenge Found on the Banks of Zhaojiahuayuanbang</h3>
<p>Half of Face Chopped Off</p>
<p>At around 9:00 a.m. yesterday, police chief Wang Junjie of the Tanziwan Police Station in Zhabei and police officers An Hongbin patrolled the intersection of Jiaotong Road and Zhongshan Road when they were informed by pedestrians there that a young man had been hacked to death on the small bank east of Zhaojiahuayuan. The police chief and others went to investigate and found that a young man of about twenty years old was lying in a pool of blood, with his head south and his feet north. He was wearing a long blue cloth robe, gray 春 spring clip pants with 綫 thread, a yellow belt, and yellow 　 and black velvet shoes. His head was flat and half of his face seemed to have been chopped off with an axe. He died and it was undoubtedly a case of revenge killing. Wang and others immediately returned to the station to report. After receiving the report, Inspector Li Qingjie led the chief police officers to re-examine the scene and confirmed that it was true, so he immediately reported to the Xinwen Sub-bureau. Director Ruan ordered that the Supervision Department of the Public Security Bureau be reported first, and Yan Deshan, the local 保 baogu from 23 Tu, be ordered to apply to the Shanghai Local Court for 相 验 examination. After hearing the news, the reporter also went to see Yue at around 10:00 a.m. The place was very remote, with a small village and the surrounding area was all gardens, which could not be reached by patrolling police officers. It was about three Huali from the nearest Dagang Bridge position. The deceased seemed to have been tricked to the place by his enemies and killed. At the moment, no family came to claim the body.</p>
<h3>Dancing Girl Li Xiuying Accuses University Student Pan Xunzhi; After Yesterday's Debate, Verdict Set for the 23rd</h3>
<p>Pan Xunzhi from Anhui, a graduate of Fudan University, 26 years old, already married with children, residing at No. 18, Yongfu South Lane, Donghan Bi Li Road, was sued in the First Special District Court by Li Xiuying from Ningbo (17 years old), a dancing girl at the Dadong Dance Hall, along with her mother Li Zhang, engaging lawyers Huang Xiu Bo and Huang Xiu Qi for charges of luring, restricting freedom, and causing injury under Articles 257, 318, and 293 of the Criminal Code. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zeshu of the First Special Court conducted a trial in the First Criminal Division. Both parties appeared in court as summoned. Li Xiuying testified that she works as a dancing girl at the Dadong Dance Hall and also performs tea dances at the Xinhua Dance Hall. She met the defendant, Pan Xunzhi, through dancing about a year ago. On January 6th of this year, the defendant invited her out, and after dancing at the Yangzi Hotel dance hall, she was taken to room 717 upstairs and raped. Because she resisted at the time, the defendant wrote her a note promising to marry her, or else give her 4,000 yuan for living expenses. Later, she was raped again in room 433 of the Shangdu Hotel. Her mother was unaware of this. On the 12th of this month, she was taken to the home of a Mr. Wang on Xiamen Road, and forced to sign a note stating she was willing to marry the defendant, or else be fined 4,000 yuan. Due to the use of force, she had no choice but to comply. That evening, the defendant forbade her from dancing with other customers. She called her mother, but the defendant injured her mother's breasts, eyes, and other parts of her body, hence the lawsuit. Li Zhang also submitted evidence of the assault. Pan Xunzhi stated in his defense that his relationship with Li Xiuying began before January 6th, at rooms 812 or 814 of the Yangzi Hotel, not 717. The note was written after the relationship began, and they stayed together numerous times, which he cannot recall. The note written by Li Xiuying was of her own free will, without coercion. He already had a wife, which Li knew and had even met. His current residence at No. 29 Xiamen Road was rented by Li, and the note she gave him stated that everything she owned belonged to Pan Xunzhi, and if she remarried or behaved improperly, she would compensate Pan with 4,000 yuan. The dispute on March 12th arose because a dance customer did not give Li Xiuying a dance ticket after dancing with her. He questioned her why she didn't ask the customer for it, and her answer was vague. He questioned her again, and she called her mother, who brought over twenty gangsters who severely beat him, causing injuries. In self-defense, he fought back. He then reported the incident, and they were both taken to the Laozha Police Station, where it was confirmed that injuries were present. The plaintiff's testimony was mostly fabricated. Judge Wu, after reviewing the testimonies and considering the facts clear, ordered the debate to begin and announced that the verdict would be delivered on the morning of the 23rd. Pan was released on 200 yuan bail.</p>
<h3>Mutual Accusations of Adultery: Longtime Couple Suddenly Become Bitter Enemies; Wife Catches Husband in Adultery, Takes Him to the Police Station for Reprimand, Then Released; Husband Catches Wife in Adultery, Sends Her to Court, Court Orders Acquittal</h3>
<p>Ma Zhishui from Ningbo, 40 years old, engaged in the business of clocks, watches, and phonographs, married Mao, also from Ningbo, 39 years old, for over twenty years. Their relationship was generally good, with one son and one daughter, both grown and married. Three years ago, Ma and Mao suddenly had disagreements, became suspicious of each other, and went to extremes, eventually leading to litigation. Ma filed a lawsuit in court, seeking a divorce from Mao. The court ruled against Ma. Since then, Ma and Mao were husband and wife in name only, but actually lived separately. Ma paid 30 yuan per month for living expenses, and Mao lived alone at No. 10, Lane 448, Tianjin Road. However, Ma initially paid the living expenses, but after two months, he claimed he could not afford it and stopped paying. Mao filed a lawsuit in court, requesting the court to order her husband to fulfill the contract. After repeated trials, the case went on for years, until the Supreme Court finally concluded the matter. From then on, their feelings became increasingly worse, and the loving couple became bitter enemies. Both sides schemed and plotted to retaliate. On the 3rd of last month, Mao discovered that her husband, Ma Zhishui, was having an affair with a woman and went to catch them in the act, but was reprimanded and dismissed after taking them to the police station. Then, on the evening of the night before last, around 11 PM, Ma also discovered that his wife was having an affair with Xu Wenhan from Shaoxing (Xu is 48 years old and the eldest son of Xu Qianlin, the general manager of the Jiangwan Model Factory) at her residence on Tianjin Road. Ma led his younger brother Ma Xiangyuan, and shop employees Zhu Gongkuan and Chen A'hai to catch them in the act. Upon entering the room, they found Mao and Xu together. They called Chinese Constable No. 798, who arrested Mao and Xu and took them to the Laozha Police Station, where they were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were charged with adultery under Article 256 of the Criminal Code, with the woman being a married woman. Zhang Shizhu, the police station's lawyer, stated the case, saying that both defendants denied having committed adultery in the police station, requesting further investigation. Ma Zhishui stated that Mao was his wife, and they had been separated for many years. He had known about Mao's improper behavior and affair with Xu for two years, but lacking evidence, he secretly investigated until last night when he confirmed Xu had entered his wife's residence again for adultery. He led his brother and others to catch them. They found the door locked and broke in, finding the two lying in bed together. Xu was naked from the waist down, while Mao had already put on her clothes. He immediately called the Chinese constable to have Xu put on his pants and taken to the police station. He requested severe punishment and compensation for losses. Chinese Constable No. 798 and witnesses Ma Xiangyuan and others also submitted evidence. Mao stated that after separating from her husband Ma Zhishui, she opened the Dalu Phonograph Company on Tianjin Road and rented the remaining rooms to Xu Wenhan, who opened the Deda Phonograph Company. Last night, she summoned Xu to settle accounts, but her husband gathered over a dozen people and assaulted them without explanation, forcibly stripping Xu's pants, accusing them of adultery, and taking them to the police station. She claimed she did not commit adultery and that her husband was retaliating for her previous attempt to catch him in adultery. Xu Wenhan also denied adultery. He Ma, 20 years old, the daughter of Ma and Mao, testified that she lived with her mother in the pavilion room, while her mother lived in the front building. After her mother separated from her father, they opened the Dalu Phonograph Company due to financial difficulties and sought help from Xu Qianlin, a comprador at the Shengli Phonograph Company, who sent his eldest son Xu Wenhan to help with the business, but there was no misconduct. Last night, her father came, claiming to be catching adultery and locking her room door. Lawyer Zhang Shizhu of the police station stated that Ma Zhishui had known about this matter two years ago. According to Article 218 of the Criminal Procedure Law, the statute of limitations has expired. Judge Ye ruled that both defendants should be acquitted, and the related civil suit should be transferred to the Civil Court for trial.</p>

<h3>Husband is Reckless Outside; Wife Requests Divorce</h3>
<p>Zhang Chunling from Ningbo, 30 years old, residing at No. 5, Zexin Lane, Diswei Road, married a Ms. Wu from the same hometown in the eleventh year of the Republic through a matchmaker. Their relationship was initially close, but after living together for fourteen years, Wu learned in July of last year that Zhang was having an affair, renting a house at No. 39, Yuanchang Lane, Yuanchang Road, and living with his mistress, neglecting his family. After repeated persuasion failed, she engaged a lawyer and filed a lawsuit for divorce against Zhang Chunling in the First Special District Court. Judge Luo conducted a trial yesterday morning based on the plaintiff Wu's statement that her husband was reckless outside and beyond imagination. He ignored her requests for money for household expenses. In desperation, she returned to her mother's home temporarily last October while continuing to write letters to persuade him and ask for living expenses. She finally obtained a check, but when she went to the bank to withdraw the money, she discovered that the defendant had no funds in the account and was merely using deception to placate her. When the check was returned, she argued with him, and he assaulted her. She requested that the divorce be granted. The defendant Zhang Chunling admitted to having a mistress and a two-year-old daughter. He claimed that he did not mistreat Wu and did not want a divorce after being married for over ten years. He used to give her 15 yuan per month for spending money, and he also bore the other household expenses. But last year, her attitude suddenly changed, and she pawned her clothes and did not behave properly. Judge Luo, after reviewing the testimonies, decided that further investigation was needed and rescheduled the hearing for the 28th.</p>

<h3>Letter</h3>
<p>To the Editor, I am writing in response to the news in your newspaper about real estate tycoons such as Cheng Linsheng and Huang Yanfang initiating the organization of the Shanghai Commercial Economic Association, and the publication of various interviews. I am greatly surprised. I was in Beijing for business and only arrived in Shanghai two days ago. I did not participate in the aforementioned organization, nor did I know its contents beforehand, and I did not make any public statements. The news in your newspaper is likely based on inaccurate rumors. I request that you correct the information and publish this letter in the letters section to clarify the matter. Yours sincerely, Yanfang, March 20th.</p>
<p>Note: This newspaper did not publish Mr. Huang's interview.</p>

The impression we get of the foreign trade of various non-aggregate countries this year is the same as the above items, that is, whether it is import or export trade, its value has improved compared to 1932. Among them, although the import volume of the United States in 1934 decreased slightly, the export trade developed, and as a result, its trade surplus increased significantly.</p>

<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— (Sha Yongcai) (Yan Xinquan)</p>
<p>When President Zhang Boling of Nankai University and his wife, Wang Shuzhen, held a celebration for their 40th wedding anniversary in Nankai Auditorium, he said in his speech: "Wives often hope that their husbands will get rich, but they don't know that the first person their husbands will dislike when they get rich is you." "In the responsibility for a harmonious marriage, men should take 65% to 70%, and women should only take 30% to 35%." "Both sides must lower their status, be able to tolerate and yield, and not be afraid to lie, which is a good way to achieve harmony." These clever words contain profound truths. These few sentences are worth a manual on wifemanship or husbandmanship.</p>
<p>Tian Xu Wo Sheng recently published a statement in the newspaper regarding those who send free books and letters in seven-character sentences. Although it has a humorous meaning, we cannot regard it as humorous writing. I am now transcribing it as follows: "Chinese people should use domestic products; everyone recognizes this statement. Although I cannot force others, others cannot force me. I especially hate letters or publications that use foreign paper. I often put them on a high shelf unopened, or throw them into the fire. I have not seen the text in them. Postal registration must be correct. It is not laziness or failure to reply. It is because of this that I am letting down the kindness."</p>
<h3>Sequel to Records of Strange Surnames</h3>
<p>— Citizen's Words</p>
<p>In the March 7th issue of this publication, Mr. Wan's "Records of Strange Surnames" listed mostly names of celebrities, which naturally many people would know. However, I also know a few surnames that Mr. Wan didn't mention, which are also considered strange by the general public. As for whether they are in the Hundred Family Surnames? Because I haven't read it, I can only ignore that. I am writing them out now as a further addition to it. (Gong) This is my surname. I have wandered north and south for twenty years and rarely encountered a clan member. Four or five years ago, Gong Bingfan, who was a teacher in Jiangxi, was said to have moved from Henan to Shaanxi, and was indeed a member of the same family. Apart from that, on the opera bills in Guangzhou, you often see Gong ××, but I don't know if that's their surname. (Mu) Ten years ago, I visited a classmate at the Guanzhong Hall in Beiping. At that time, as soon as he saw me, he shouted "Old Mu, Old Mu!" "Come quickly, come quickly!" "Now I've found you a Gong." After a while, this Mr. Mu came in and laughed heartily, saying, "It's very interesting. Once I went to the post office to mail a letter, and there were many people waiting for registration. Among them, a young man kept smiling at me. I was completely baffled. Later, when I saw his envelope, I suddenly understood. It turned out he wrote 'Father' sealed, while I wrote 'Mother' sealed. That's when I realized that Father is also a surname." (Yun) Is the surname of my grandmother's family. (Suo) Cun De is my cousin. He served as the patrol inspector of Linggu in Shaanxi during the late Qing Dynasty. (Ju) Zhang Baomin was a general under Guo Jian of Shaanxi in the 1920s. People called him Commander Dog. (Yan) Zhilan was a division commander under Fan Zhongxiu. (Gong) Fu Kui (Ji) and Xifeng were both commanders during the Jingguo Army era in Shaanxi. Both were from Shanxi. (Tie) When I was in Xi'an, there was a noodle shop owner surnamed Tie. I heard he was a Muslim. (Hua) Lianshi was a famous gentleman from Gongxian County, Henan. (Shan) Shuibin is a merchant from Henan. Now living in Dongxin Jujushun Gong. Aren't the others, like (Diao) Banhua, who co-starred in "Han Jiang Luo Yan" with Lianhua and Chen Yan; lawyer (Li) Aokui; shot put athlete (Yi) Ming, all rarely seen surnames?</p>
<h3>New News from the Lake</h3>
<p>— Master of Shi Garden</p>
<p>Time passes like a stream, and on West Lake, peach blossoms are just blooming, and new willows are already green. The mountain is like a painting, gradually entering its best scenery. The six bridges and three temples are once again a different kind of beauty. It is only a matter of time before the bees and butterflies come and go like a tide.</p>
<p>The tour boats on the lake have recently seen gradual progress. In the past, the antique-style seats with copper railings have all been replaced since last year with two-seater or three-seater armchairs, with kapok cushions covered with white ruffled covers. Sitting comfortably on them, either leaning forward or back, leisurely in the middle of the stream, already feels more comfortable than usual. This spring there is even further improvement, with quite a proactive arrangement of sofa-style seats, four seats per boat, covered with cream-colored chair covers. In recent days, one or two have already been seen appearing on the lakefront. It is predicted that this will be a uniform era of improvement. Although it is close to Europeanization, people sitting on them ultimately find their minds and spirits more comfortable.</p>
<p>After the reconstruction of Baochu Pagoda, the Six Harmonies Pagoda will also be demolished and rebuilt. The drawings have been completed by architect Tada, and the original shape will not be changed slightly. A garden will also be arranged around the pagoda's base so that after visiting the pagoda, people can relax their feet a bit more. This plan is truly well conceived. I heard that the project will still be led by the municipal government, and funds have been helped by celebrities from all walks of life. Before long, it will be transformed, and next spring, it may be able to meet us with a new appearance, which is not necessarily known. Recently, Hangzhou established a Scenic Spot Guide Bureau within the Construction Department. In the future, those who come to this place can go to the bureau to request the dispatch of a knowledgeable guide, who will leisurely travel around, so as not to be like blowing a flute without holes, or eating "cucumbers" to the point of exhaustion. It is also heard that the bureau is currently recruiting and examining tour guides, and is actively engaged in training, in order to meet the needs.</p>
<p>Among the six parks on the lakefront, there was previously the "Chen Yingshi Memorial Tower," and the "Memorial Tower for the Martyrs of the Northern Expedition." Recently, the "Memorial Tower for the Martyrs of the 88th Division in the Battle of Shanghai" has been completed, standing tall on the lakefront, extremely majestic. It is enough to give a dose of stimulants to the West Lake tourists who are infatuated with the gentle land.</p>
<h3>A Mystery of Life</h3>
<p>— Zi Wei</p>
<p>I was casually talking with a friend, and we got on the topic of so-and-so's situation. In less than a year, he had been promoted three levels in a row. The treatment in this organization cannot be said to be unkind. However, so-and-so, in the same position and the same job, is still the same as before. Not only is there no hope of promotion, but his own job is also a bit shaky.</p>
<p>According to my friend, Mr. B's knowledge is much more profound than Mr. A's. He is also very diligent in his official duties, but he has a somewhat "you are you, I am I" temperament, so his director and he don't get along very well. As for Mr. A, he relies on his talent and is arrogant, looking down on everything, but he is submissive to his immediate superior, with pleasing expressions and laughter. When casually chatting with others, he must argue for the director's virtue and talent at every mention of their director, placing him high above everyone else. Although people scoff at it, Mr. A acts as if nothing happened, with a general attitude of "let people laugh and scold."</p>
<p>As the end of the year approached, the authorities inquired of the director about the performance appraisal, and the director strongly defended Mr. A, saying that Mr. A was prudent in public matters, quick in his work, and a leader among his peers. Mr. B was slow and procrastinating, and not worth mentioning. The authorities nodded.</p>
<p>Days later, the public announcement was made, and Mr. A was indeed honored with a key position, while Mr. B was severely reprimanded and retained on probation.</p>
<p>Afterwards, my friend discussed this matter with his old man, who greatly praised Mr. A's skill in dealing with the world. My friend disagreed, saying, "Based on the director's words alone, the success or failure is immediately apparent. However, the authorities have not carefully examined it even once." The old man said, "You are truly a fool. In today's world, you still want to use your true skills as a way to earn a living? No wonder you will die old under the window, not being used by the world." My friend still argued strongly, his anger still not subsided, so he told me about it, wanting a fair judgment. I simply said, "Mr. A certainly has the art of ascending to greatness, and the old man is experienced in the ways of the world. Speaking of this kind of mystery of life, how can you and I possibly break it?"</p>
<p>News about Distinguished Ladies’ Paintings: This year's Women's Painting and Calligraphy Exhibition is being actively prepared. Ms. Chen Xiaocui is invited to be the chief editor of the catalogue, the contents of which will include selected works of calligraphy, painting, poetry, lyrics and prose by women. In addition to soliciting works from members of this association, contributions from the female community are welcome. The deadline is March 13th. Please send submissions to No. 59, Anlefang, Jing'an Temple, Shanghai.</p>
<h3>Records of Lingering Fragrance</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Because the facilities provided by the Empress Dowager for silkworm raising were so elaborate, the girls raising the silkworms were also extra careful, but every day, several tens of silkworms – about two or three per thousand – inevitably died due to various reasons. But even if we found dead silkworms, we were absolutely not allowed to say "a silkworm died," and could only silently pick it out. Not only that, but there were many more superstitious customs in silkworm raising! No one was allowed to point at a certain silkworm and say "not good," or "ugly," or other bad words; if they said so, then the silk spun by these silkworms later would inevitably also be "not good" or "ugly." And these girls who specialized in raising silkworms each wore a very wide ribbon tied on their heads, so that their hair would not be scattered at all, supposedly as a model for the silkworms to see; after they saw it, the silk they spun would also not be scattered at all. These girls also wore another brightly colored belt tied around their waists, cinching their waists very tightly, supposedly also as a model for the silkworms to see; after they saw it, the cocoons they made would generally also be particularly thin in the middle and thick and round at both ends, with a very good appearance. These girls in the silkworm room not only could not say bad words, but also had to constantly say a few flattering or encouraging words to the silkworms, like educating a child, so that at the final harvest, they could obtain very fine silk.</p>
<p>Although the color of the silkworms themselves is generally grayish-white, the silk they spin has pure white and golden yellow colors, with golden yellow being more valuable. (273)</p>

<h3>A Multifaceted View of Ruan Lingyu's Suicide</h3>
<p>— Ding Ming</p>
<p>Shanghai is the Paris of the Orient, a paradise built on hell. Since International Women's Day on March 8th, the forum of the press has focused its explosive point on the suicide of movie star Ruan Lingyu, making it even more apparent.</p>
<p>When Ruan Lingyu's stinking carcass (in Buddhist terms) was placed in the International Funeral Home, putting on a final show of "new woman" radiance, everyone who read the newspaper focused their gaze on her body or in the newspaper: There were different opinions about the great change in people's hearts, and there were also different ways of saying that it greatly changed people's hearts. We might as well analyze it and shine an X-ray on all aspects.</p>
<p>Placed in the stubborn mindset of people in a capitalist feudal society, they will definitely shake their heads and wag their tails, scolding her fiercely, "A good horse doesn't wear two saddles, a good woman doesn't marry twice"; death is too good for her.</p>
<p>Placed in the eyes of the proletariat, they will curl their lips and snort! "Tch, weak thing!"</p>
<p>Placed at the corners of movie fans' mouths, they will touch their scalps, tears falling on their cheeks, greatly saddened by the future of the film industry; or they will beat their chests and stomp their feet, shedding tears of sympathy.</p>
<p>Placed in the minds of those who are deeply suffering from love, they will feel a bucket of cold water poured over their heads, sobering them up. And those in love triangles will automatically untie their loops.</p>
<p>Placed on the hearts of movie performers, they may sigh and weep; or they may think this is her delusion; or they may think this is no different than offering a burning bomb to the International Women's Day; there may even be those who secretly rejoice that Ruan Lingyu's death will allow them (the second person) to take her place!</p>
<p>Placed in front of the film circle's environment, actors will refuse to perform tragic scripts; theaters will also cater to the general public's psychology and show optimistic films.</p>
<p>Placed in the heart of Ruan Lingyu before her death, her spirit must have been comforting itself: her inner spirit warned her that reality was ugly and contradictory; the external villains were oppressing and attacking her, it was better to die! Dying caused everyone to laugh, get angry, shed tears, sigh, be angry, imagining countless men and women showing different expressions, as enthusiastic as watching her performances on the screen; that was truly the culmination of film art; laughing at Ai Xia's covering up, without the subtlety of her performance.</p>
<p>Placed in the perspective of psychologists, they must have understood her drunken state after attending a friend's banquet for seven days and nights, her mad kissing, her unrestrained dancing, her enjoyment; suddenly throwing a smoke screen at midnight, writing a suicide note as if returning to death, how heroic, how natural; it was purely a sensitive nerve action filled with emotion by a tragic actress. This posture of secretly singing when happy, and laughing wildly when crying, was also her only way of self-consolation and discharge in her lonely life.</p>
<p>However, I extremely approve of what a certain newspaper commentator said: I hope that those who want to die for love will change the direction of this kind of "martyrdom for litigation" or other martyrdom for love, martyrdom for righteousness... and express it in revolutionary actions in the women's movement.</p>

<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>When we arrived, we stayed in a small hotel here. Although I heard there was a Little Western Paradise, I didn't invite guests or meet friends, so I never came here. More than half a month after that Mr. Lian left, his friend sent me a postcard from Nanjing, saying that he had gone to Guangdong and advised me not to wait bitterly in Xi'an and to plan my return south as soon as possible. At that time, I received this letter, and I was both scared and angry, and cried for a long time. The hotel owner, on the other hand, was conscientious. He said, "Things have come to this point, you have to quickly think of a way. Crying randomly, can you cry out any reason?" I said, "Coming to Xi'an, I have no relatives or friends, where can I go to think of a way? Even that Mr. Lian only knew a few people in Xi'an, but they had nothing to do with him and嫌he came here." They stopped paying attention to him long ago. I am not his woman, just someone he cheated into coming here, and people will not pay attention to me even more." The hotel owner said again, "If you were indeed cheated here by him, people might forgive you. If you say you are his woman, people won't help you." I thought about it, and this was probably true, so I honestly told his friends about this matter. I also went to various hotels to look for people from the East, hoping for a chance. From that time on, I came to Little Western Paradise, and at that time, I fell another step down. I met a few fellow villagers in Little Western Paradise, and they didn't refuse me much, asking me to accompany them to smoke opium and play cards, often giving me a few dollars to cover my expenses. There were always new people from the East coming to the various hotels, and new fellow villagers introducing old fellow villagers, so I took advantage of this opportunity to mingle with the fellow villagers, mixing until now. Everyone calls me Miss Yang, to cover my face. Actually..." His face was pale and injured, and he couldn't say the words. (162)</p>

<h3>Finance Under Sassoon's Fierce Suppression, the Gold Market's Rise Was Fleeting</h3>
<p>People's Hearts Were Still Stable, with More Trading After the Lows, Resulting in a Drop of $1.30</p>
<p>After the gold market's sudden surge the previous morning, yesterday's market still had lingering momentum, once approaching the $80 mark. The exchange market failed to keep pace, and the rise was suppressed. The central bank wanted to block the remittance orders, and Sassoon took the opportunity to sell US dollars. The domestic market loosened, and the price fell back immediately. However, people's hearts still seemed prosperous, and the final result was a state of fluctuation. In the early morning, the overseas silver market showed a slight drop in London and stability in the US. The forward silver market also fell, but only slightly. Exchange rates rebounded, and London's raw gold rose by 3.5 pence. Reports said that the Belgian cabinet was overthrown by the opposition for supporting the gold standard, and the position of the French franc was shaken, which would affect the London gold market and indirectly affect the central bank's appetite for spot trading, causing people's hearts to darken. The over-the-counter preliminary trading opened, falling from $73.4 to just over $70. The central bank's official exchange rates were announced, with London unchanged and the US rising by 1.875. The customs gold unit rose by 3%. The standard price for tenders rose to $913.60. Major players maintained their positions at low prices, and the psychology of retail investors turned prosperous again, and the price rebounded immediately after the lows. However, the morning opening was low, and the price hovered uncertainly after the opening. Exchange rates were normal, and once fell, nearly touching the $70 mark. Buying interest revived after the lows, and gradually pulled the price up. Chinese merchants' appetite tended to be aggressive, but it was difficult to find a counterparty. Banks traded with each other, the domestic market tightened, and the rise intensified, but it did not break through the $80 mark. After the high, the supply gradually increased, and it was anticipated that the Hong Kong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's (HSBC) official exchange rates would be announced, with London and the US shrinking by 0.125 each. After this, the price gradually declined. The central bank's attempt to block the remittance orders failed, and Sassoon forcefully blocked US dollars, causing the exchange market to loosen again, and the market weakened. However, popular sentiment was still hidden, and there was still much fluctuation after the lows. Although there was a rebound in the morning, it was difficult to sustain for long under Sassoon's high-pressure blocking. In the end, it was a perfunctory end. The overall trend of the half-day was uncertain, and there were many twists and turns in the middle. The swap premium was still around $1. The half-day market conditions are recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was $872, a drop of $2.30 compared to the previous close. Hengyu and Dada immediately advanced to $4. Fuxing, Yongda, Huixiang, and Dafa Yongyong Li took the opportunity to sell, retreating to $0.05. Banque Belge pulled 3 months forward at $0.3125, Fuda, Dafa, Wanxing, Dafa Yong and Fuxing Yong took the opportunity to advance, rising to $6. Yingxiang and Hengyu took the opportunity to sell, falling to $4.20. Dafa Yong and Fuxing Yong still advanced to $7. Wanxing and Yingxiang took the opportunity to sell short, retreating to $5. The exchange market has tightened, and banks are mutually trading 5 months forward at 7 pence. Fuxing Yong and Dafa Yong worked hard to buy, rising to $9.50. Hengyu and Yongli took the opportunity to later sell, retreating to $7.50. Yuan Yichang, Dafu Yu, Yuqing and Yong Jinfeng Yong still came to buy, rising to $9. It was anticipated that HSBC's official exchange rates would be announced, with London and the US each shrinking by 0.125, and people's hearts were weakening instead. Fuxing Yong, Hengyu and Fuyu came to sell, falling to $5.60. Fuyu Qian, Changxiang, and Shangna rose to $7.20. The central bank's willingness to block 5 months forward at $0.0625 failed, and Sassoon also issued 5 months forward US dollars at $0.0625. Fusheng Yong, Hengyu Yong, Lisheng Da Yi, Yu Huixiang Dafa Yong Dada sold off one after another, falling to $1.50. Mercantile Bank pulled 6 months forward US dollars at $38. Fuxing Yong and Wanxing advanced to $4.20. Sassoon continued to sell, and Dafa Yong Dadecheng, Huixiang and Shengda fiercely dumped, falling to $1.40. Fuxing Yong, Yifeng Yong, Dafa Yong, Yongli, Jinlong and Yicheng jointly advanced short orders, gradually rising to $4.80. Dada Hengyu Dadecheng and Yongli had not yet sold, and fell again to $2.50. Fuyu and Fuxing Yong Na short orders, once rising to $5.10. Sassoon's blocking of 6 months forward US dollars at $0.9375 failed. Richang Yicheng Yongli and Fuxing Yong came to sell, retreating to $2.20. Fuyu Yuqing Yong Yuan Yi took the opportunity to maintain the lows, rising to $3.50. Under the fluctuation, the noon close was $873. The market was stable after the close. The highest price in the half-day was $879.50, and the lowest price was $870.50, with a fluctuation of $9. As a result, it was slightly down $1.30 compared to the previous close.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the central bank's standard gold tender price, was raised to $913.60, implying that the closing price was about $40 lower, more than $3 higher than the previous close. For April accounting, $871, for May accounting, $873. The morning make-up water was $863. The price of pure gold was about $5 higher, at $877. Guest merchants, seeing the gold market rebound, slightly sold. Tianjin goods were about $9 higher, sold by the Tianjin merchants to Yingfeng Heng and Dadecheng, 350 taels each. The swap situation was stable, and the number of transactions was small. Initially, Dafeng gave Fuxing water 14 short orders at $1.20, Shenkang gave Fuxing Yong 56 short orders, and Dadecheng gave Yuan 7 short orders, all at $1.20. Wanxing gave Yuan Mao water 7 short orders at $0.50. Dacheng suddenly came to issue short orders, lacking short sellers, and the takers paid $1.40. Later, 35 short orders were given to Wu Mao Yong at $1.</p>
<p>Over-the-counter trading was normal. Overall, Yuqing Yong Shunmao Yuan Mao Yong Tiancheng Xiang Yu Xinxing Chang Dada Changxiang Dadecheng Yifeng Water Yi Yu Tongtaichang Hongkang Yong Renfa Yong Yongde Hongli Dafeng Xiangfeng etc. were on the buying side. Dacheng Wanxing Shengda Hengchang Yong Richang Hengyu Fuxing Yong Yongli Yicheng Qian Changxiang Dada Dafa Yong Fuyu Shunli etc. were on the selling side.

The Dalian merchants Wanxing made a total of 900 low-priced orders, netting out more than 400 short orders. Shunli made a total of more than 300 short orders, netting out a small number. The Guangdong merchants Hengxing were normal, Shengda advanced a small number, exiting more than 300. The total number of half-day transactions was 37,387 short orders.</p>

<h3>No Change in Foreign Exchange Rate</h3>
<p>Merchandise Shipments Active… Collections Slightly More Complex</p>
<p>Yesterday, the foreign exchange rate remained unchanged. The morning market opened at six points. Adding water to the "Hua Tou" [speculative buying] was easy given the current market sentiment, but there were no firm market prices and all transactions were "Bai Hua" [speculative selling]. Foreign exchange warrant transactions saw over 4.1 million in morning transfers, with over 200,000 in new transactions. The afternoon market saw a transaction volume of over [blank]  million. Transactions within the Small General Association reached over 800,000. Currently, commercial loans in various industries are being activated in succession, and the demand for funds is increasing. Therefore, the collection and disbursement of funds in the banking sector seems to have increased compared to the previous day. However, due to restrictions, full development is still not possible. Foreign mortgages took in over 660,000, with new mortgages amounting to over 550,000. Banknote inflows and outflows totaled 2.67 million. Funds from out-of-town sources amounted to 300,000, while outbound funds saw no record. In terms of bank collections, foreign banks collected 2.2 million in promissory notes, over 3.1 million in various merchandise exchange and miscellaneous funds, over 600,000 in special remittances, and over 800,000 in foreign exchange settlements, with 700,000 withdrawn from warehouses. Chinese banks collected 3.4 million in promissory notes, over 3.8 million in various merchandise exchange and tax miscellaneous funds, over 700,000 in special remittances, and over 1.1 million in foreign exchange settlements, with 500,000 moved into warehouses.

Copper coins amounted to 335,000, which was 3,500 less than the previous day, with transactions totaling 30,150,000 wen, equivalent to 9,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the total exchange volume of the local clearing house on the 20th was 10,042,875 yuan, 7 jiao, and 3 fen, including 5,181,022 yuan, 3 jiao, and 3 fen in silver dollars and 5,247,553 yuan and 4 jiao in exchange drafts.</p>
<h3>Securities and Bonds: Slight Short Covering Expected in the Future Market</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange witnessed the issuance of 10 million yuan in new bonds, which was considered a justified event based on verified information. The sharp decline in the evening session the day before was merely due to speculative sentiment. Those who blindly shorted had no choice but to cover their positions to avoid being squeezed as the settlement date approached. Market sentiment was still positive, and prices rose as soon as there was some upward momentum. With the settlement date approaching, a showdown was imminent. The number of outstanding accounts was still significant, with the "22 Customs" bonds being the most prominent. There were still eight to nine million in outstanding accounts for this month. The future direction of strength is yet to be determined and a fierce contest is expected. Yesterday, at the opening of the morning session, the lingering effects of the previous day's decline were still present, with "Bian Qian" [disbandment bonds] and "Cai Bing" [demobilization bonds] both down by a few "er san jiao" [small amounts]. Later, buying pressure gradually increased, and market prices improved, trending higher across the board with gains of five "fen" to one to three "jiao". The "48" bond showed strong appetite, and the situation reversed sharply. In the second session, the "43" and "17" bonds saw significant buying, while the "23" bond continued to be sold off, but market prices continued to improve by about two to three "jiao". At the opening of the afternoon session, [missing characters], sentiment was quite firm, and all items rose again by two to three "jiao". The closing trend was [missing characters], but the sale of long-term salt tax bonds for the "40" bond caused the upward momentum to falter, and later bonds were relatively soft. As a result, prices rose uniformly, mostly by one or two "jiao" to three or five "jiao", but the "Jin Duan" bond surged by seven and a half "jiao". The total transaction volume was 11 million yuan. The resulting price changes are listed in the table below (unit: 100 yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Belgian Cabinet Resignation Affects US Stock Market</h3>
<p>A report from Sin Fung Foreign Firm stated that yesterday (the 19th), the Belgian cabinet resigned to uphold the gold standard. However, U.S. stocks and commodities rebounded due to excessive declines. Some speculators believed that Belgium's development was a precursor to the continued depreciation of the U.S. dollar, but traders were generally cautious, resulting in extremely sluggish activity. After the Belgian cabinet's resignation, the foreign exchange market was extremely chaotic. The Belgian franc plummeted by 32 points, and the French franc also fell by more than 2 points. The British pound, on the other hand, rose by more than 2 "fen". The stock market also benefited from the rebound in U.S. telephone stocks. The bond market was mixed. The Belgian 1955 July bond fell by as much as 7 yuan. Small exchange stocks were slightly more stable. The total daily transaction volume was 510,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>
<p>Dow Jones New York Index | March 18 | March 19 | Change</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>10 Industrial Stocks | 97.01 | 98.31 | Up 0.30</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: This Month's Yarn Sees a Lone Increase</h3>
<p>Distant Futures Still Falling by Several Jiao</p>
<p>The yarn market first rose and then declined, but the situation for this month alone is tight. Because there are not many bullish parties preparing to take delivery of goods, the attitude is calm, and there is still no sign of emergence. However, distant months are becoming increasingly loose due to the deterioration of global trends and the presence of new sellers in the market. Nevertheless, overseas markets have been falling sharply for days, and a reactive rebound is expected. Shanghai, which previously failed to respond to the decline, now also lacks the power to rebound.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Rises Near Term, Falls Distant Term</p>
<p>At the opening of the market for standard yarn, all months tended to rise because the rebound in American cotton after a major decline stabilized sentiment. In addition, Mr. Xu's big loss in another firm pushed the market even higher. Floating accounts were actively covering positions, and this month alone was tight, with bullish parties showing no signs of easing. It rose by nine "jiao", and distant months rose by 1.3, 6, 7, and 8 "jiao". The market turned down after the opening of the afternoon session, and sentiment relaxed because the cotton market was sluggish, and the yarn market was affected. However, this month rose again by three "jiao", and the rest fell by four, five, six, and eight "jiao". Sold: Dafu 1,100 bales, Tongji 800 bales, Yida 1,900 bales, Yichang 750 bales, Renfeng 550 bales, Dafeng 550 bales, Yuanyi 790 bales, Changfeng 750 bales, Dachang 700 bales, Yongchang 600 bales, and Hengchang 650 bales.

<h3>Standard Cotton is Being Hedged and Sold by Silver Companies</h3>
<p>Market Prices Are Even Harder to Support</p>
<p>In the early morning, the cotton market had a moment of firmness and tended to rise because American cotton rebounded, and sentiment was excited. Unexpectedly, when prices rose, the banking sector had a large amount of cotton goods under mortgage. Currently, [missing characters] in the world cotton market are unanimously falling, and cotton prices in Shanghai have not fallen enough. Therefore, a large number of hedges are being sold, and the market is becoming more difficult to hold.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Cannot Withstand</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning market for standard cotton, all months rose unanimously, and the rising momentum was very strong. This was mainly because American cotton had fallen sharply for days, and now it has rebounded by more than 30 points, and short sellers were excited to cover their positions, rising by two or three "jiao". It was expected that the market was high, and the banking sector was very active in issuing cotton mortgages. Spot cotton transactions in the market were cut off. Moreover, 20,000 pieces of American and Indian cotton were purchased by Japanese factories yesterday, and the prices were about 2 yuan cheaper than Chinese cotton. Therefore, by the third session, a large number of 20,000 to 30,000 dan were hedged, and the market was suppressed and fell. As a result, near terms rose by one and a half "jiao", and distant terms were flat. The selling momentum was strong after the opening of the afternoon session. It was rumored that the banking sector was hedging and selling physical goods, and sentiment was even more shocked. The decline was in full swing, and the May contract broke the 3 yuan mark. At the close, it was heard that Indian cotton had risen by 6 rupees in the after-hours market, and there was still news of American cotton rising. Distant terms rose slightly. After the result in the afternoon, near terms fell by two "jiao" to one and a half "jiao", and distant months were unchanged. Sold: Changhe 7,500 dan, Yifeng 5,700 dan, Dachang 2,800 dan, Taichang 2,100 dan, Yicheng 2,100 dan, Shenji 1,900 dan, Yongda 2,300 dan, Dafeng 1,300 dan, Yukang 3,000 dan, Tongji 25,000 dan, Jifeng 2,200 dan, Dafu 7,100 dan, Suilong 4,800 dan, Daji 2,100 dan, and Senkang 2,400 dan. Buyers: Xincheng 3,000 dan, Dafeng 5,600 dan, Dafu 3,000 dan, Hexing 3,500 dan, Gengfeng 9,200 dan, Yuanyi 3,800 dan, Runkang 6,500 dan, Hengchang 4,100 dan, Xinheng 2,300 dan, Yuanxingchang 4,000 dan, Yuanda 3,200 dan, Shengyuan 2,800 dan, and Changfeng 2,400 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Cotton | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Outstanding Accounts</p>
<p>------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | -------- | --------</p>
<p>March | 33.75 | 33.20 | 33.30 | Down 0.20 | 32,200</p>

<p>August | 24.00 | 33.55 | 23.75 | ...... | 93,200</p>
<p>Total | 763,600</p>
<p>Almost No Factory Demand</p>
<p>The current cotton demand is abnormally quiet. Factories have almost no purchasing appetite because they have purchased too much foreign cotton, and there is absolutely no demand for Chinese cotton. The source is 322 bales of Yao cotton.</p>
<p>Fire Engine Cotton | 39.40 | Delivered to Shenxin Factory | 100 | Bales of Spot Goods Delivered to Factory</p>
<h3>American Cotton Rebounds by More Than Thirty Points</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was slightly less active and the trend was relatively firm. At the opening, because of good news from Liverpool, Liverpool banks and brokers absorbed the selling from the Far East. Each month rose by 7 to 14 points. There were not many sellers, and some who were looking for a rebound bought in. However, peers were cautious and planned to wait for developments in Washington. Later, the Southern Senators approved the continued 1.2-cent loan for new cotton, and the market was slightly excited. At the close, spot traders bought in, and the market was firm. Spot goods rose by 30 points, and futures rose by 32 to 37 points. English cotton spot fell by 9 points, and futures rose by 6 to 8 points. Indian cotton European exporters bought in to offset the selling by futures traders. Later, speculators bought in, but this was overturned by the liquidation of long positions by futures traders. Pingle fell by 4 rupees, Aumla fell by 9.5 rupees, and Bai Luoxi fell by 9 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (telegram dated the 19th):</p>
<p>American Cotton | Compared to Previous Day | National Currency | English Cotton | Compared to Previous Day | National Currency</p>

<h3>Grain: The Futures Flour Market is Quiet but Firm</h3>
<p>Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, each month generally showed a stable trend. With foreign wheat quoted, Chicago was up 8 to 10 "fen", and Canada was up 4 to 10 "fen". When quoting prices, transactions for each month were still quiet. There were not many entries and exits in this month because the settlement date was approaching. In distant months, the factory households did not come out, and sentiment was slightly stable. In addition, the exchange rate has been slightly firm recently, and there are few sellers, so the market is slightly stable. Until the opening of the afternoon session, the market for each month was still sluggish, and the market also hovered, not much different from the morning. In the current situation, because both sides are wary, it is difficult for the speculative gangs to use their power, and it still needs to be calm for a few days. This month is unchanged, April and May are better by 1 "fen", June is better by half a "fen", July is better by 2.5 "li", and August is better by half a "fen".</p>
<h3>Foreign Wheat Arrives Continuously Standard Wheat Suddenly Loosens</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market. In the morning, with foreign wheat quoted, Chicago Canada was up 48 "fen" to 1 "jiao". When quoting prices, there were only transactions in March and April, and the prices fluctuated little. The remaining months were not opened. Until the opening of the afternoon session, transactions in each month were relatively active, and the prices suddenly loosened. In this month, because of the settlement, the bullish parties were gradually withdrawing because they saw that foreign wheat was continuing to arrive and the wharf was abundant. Therefore, the price was sluggish. For the same reason, sellers also dominated in April. There were not many transactions in the distant months, and the fluctuations were small. As a result, March and April each fell by 4 "fen", and July fell by 1 "fen". Spot wheat saw smooth delivery, and the price was stable. Shandong Suzhou wheat opened at 3 yuan, 6 jiao, and 3 "fen", Dali Jiluohe wheat opened at 3 yuan, 5 jiao, and 7 "fen", Liuhe wheat opened at 3 yuan and 5 "jiao", and Bengbu Linhuai Pass wheat opened at 3 yuan, 6 jiao. Fuxin took 4,000 bags, and Xinda took 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>Overseas Wheat</p>
<p>The rebound in the market is mostly affected by other markets. There is probably no hope of a big rise.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat | March 16 | March 19 | Change</p>

<h3>Rice Prices Fall for Consecutive Days</h3>
<p>—Dongyang Gang Actively Purchases Yesterday—</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the source of supply for each gang was still only about 20 companies (with a total of nearly 4,000 shi of goods). Among them, Su Tong's粳 [japonica rice] was even scarcer. However, both retail and wholesale sales were sluggish. Only the Yantai gang bought more than a hundred packages. Therefore, the overall market price repeatedly showed a soft tone. The rest of Su Tong's粳 depended on the small amount of goods arriving to maintain their position. The prices of other items such as Qingjiao's [green corner rice] and other thin indica rices, and the early indica rice from the Nan Gang gang, continued to fall by one "jiao". Du Yangjian [rice variety] lacked goods and had no market. Yin Yuan [silver yuan rice] was currently weak.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, more than ten boats arrived from various roads downstream. Transactions for each type of goods were sparse on the market. Spot prices for top-grade white 粳 rice were slightly higher, while mid- and low-grade goods were stable. The retail of thin indica and early indica rice was not smooth, and the price was short by nearly a "jiao". The rest also showed a soft trend. However, Bai Yuan [white yuan rice] was very tight, and although the sales of Ke Yuan [guest yuan rice] were not good, the price remained stable.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Domestic sales were still active, and there were also dealings in this street. Therefore, the market was still relatively lively. However, the market inventory was full, and arrivals were continuous. Small and long-grain West loans were heavily stockpiled, and many firms were willing to lower prices to sell off. Therefore, yesterday it fell by three to five "fen". Other grades remained flat. Yesterday, Saigon's March re-entry goods opened at 400 tons, and the price dropped to 4 yuan and 2 jiao and a half, which was more than two "jiao" lower than the previous week. Currently, more than 8,000 bags of foreign rice and 550 bags of Ke Xian [guest xian rice] are open for sale, most of which are handled by the domestic market.</p>
<p>(Soybeans) Sales were slightly more active than the previous day, so the market was relatively stable. At present, the general trend is paying attention to the intensity of cake sales. It is estimated that more than 40,000 pieces of soybean cake were traded in spot and futures. The factory side purchased more than 5,000 bags of various beans in a rolling manner.</p>
<p>(Red Continued) Japanese sales rebounded because they saw that the selling price had fallen by more than half a yuan. Therefore, they purchased at a cheap price. Yesterday, they went to various grains for more than 2,000 bags, and the market price continued to rise by six to seven "fen".</p>
<h3>Bran Prices Step by Step Reverting Slightly</h3>
<p>Recently, bran exports have been in a state of long-term dormancy. Domestic transactions are not many. After foreign wheat arrives, factories have gradually more bran to sell. Although the factories are still holding on and not selling, those who return re-entry goods are more willing to lower prices to sell off. Yesterday, there were slightly more domestic sales, and the selling price has fallen to 2 yuan, 5 jiao, and 6 "fen".</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Guangdong Coarse White Rises by Five Fen</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the sugar market was slightly better. A batch of Guangdong coarse sand white was auctioned by the Sugar Industry Cooperative Company. High-quality goods were 16 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, and 452 bags were transacted, rising by five "fen". Second-grade colors were 16 yuan and a half, unchanged, and 370 bags were transacted. The association's trading of 24 coarse sand white was called 16 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, and there were no transactions. The re-exported loan was 4 yuan and 7 jiao and a half, with a slight drawing out. Taikoo Sugar B was 17 yuan and 6 jiao, unchanged. Mianbai Zhenyu No. 1 from this factory was 16 yuan, 1 jiao, and a half, No. 2 was 16 yuan and 5 "fen", No. 3 was 15 yuan and 9 jiao, and No. 4 was 15 yuan and 7 jiao and a half. The Chao Gang opened more than 100 packages of green sugar on the trading board. Huanggang Qing was 10 yuan, the second was 9 yuan and 8 jiao, and Longgang Qing was 9 yuan and 4 jiao, which was slightly looser than before. More than 300 packages of Mei Yang White were also opened. The higher ones were 12 yuan and 8 jiao, the second was 12 yuan, 4 jiao to 2.3 jiao, and the again did not exceed 12 yuan. The market picture was flat.</p>

<h3>Police Brigade Basketball Team Loses to Jinan University: Jinan Performs Beautifully, Winning 57 to 39. The Police Brigade, New to the Venue, Was Unfamiliar and Even Famous Players Were Below Par.</h3>
<p>The Wuhan Police Brigade basketball team is a mixed group of athletes from the north. Key players Liu Zhenyuan and Yin Hongxiang are among them. Duan Zhuo and Wang Zhan were previously selected for the Beijing championships. Ge Ke, Wang Jianmin, Zheng Sen, and others are famous players from Central China. They all came to Shanghai to show their skills during the national team tryouts in Shanghai for the Far Eastern Games a few years ago. In terms of talent, they are all outstanding. This time, led by Song Ruhai, they came to Shanghai. Last night, they made their debut against Jinan University in a match at Shenyuan, but their performance was not up to par. They lost to Jinan 39 to 57. The team's coordination was decent, but their shooting was inaccurate, and they were unable to defend the large court adequately. The loss was entirely due to unfamiliarity. As for Jinan's victory, it was truly due to their actual skill and not a fluke.</p>
<p>Unfamiliar Venue</p>
<p>The competition was tense and exciting. Initially, Jinan missed several shots, which was quite disappointing. Later, they gradually became more familiar with the court. Han Zhenyuan and Yin Jinren's corner shots were very accurate. The Police Brigade team, being new to the venue, felt flustered and focused their defense on the middle, neglecting the sides. Jinan took advantage of this and scored repeatedly, with the score soaring. The difference reached a large gap of 23 to 3. The Police Brigade was at a disadvantage and tried hard to rally. At halftime, they were behind 13 to 25. In the second half, the Police Brigade did not improve and could only maintain the status quo without being able to win. Jinan's shooting was very accurate, and their offense and defense were excellent. The Police Brigade seemed inferior. Liu Zhenyuan had regressed a lot, while Yin Hongxiang was as steady as ever.</p>
<p>At a Loss</p>
<p>After the start, Jinan's Han Zhenyuan opened the scoring with a free throw. Then, he missed a sure shot under the basket, which was a pity. Xu Heng added points with a free throw, but the score remained close. The Police Brigade's Ge Ke received a clever pass from Liu Zhenyuan under the basket and jumped up to score, which boosted the morale of the spectators. Cai Yanxiong also added two points for Jinan. At this time, the Police Brigade's Wang Jianmin had already committed three fouls and was replaced by the famous player Yin Hongxiang. Unexpectedly, the Police Brigade did not improve. Liu Zhenyuan was frustrated, and Ge Ke was closely guarded by Xu Heng, making it impossible to score. Jinan's left and right flanks moved quickly, and their dribbling skills were excellent. Han Zhenyuan and Yin Guiren repeatedly scored side shots, gaining great momentum. The Police Brigade could not penetrate deep into the opposing side due to tight defense. Their coordination seemed lacking, and they made no progress, resulting in a score of 23 to 3. Jinan took a commanding lead.</p>
<p>A Glimmer of Hope</p>
<p>The Police Brigade replaced Duan Zhuo with Zheng Sen. Ge Ke scored their second basket, making it 23 to 5. Jinan softened slightly. The bald-headed Zheng Sen suddenly dribbled and scored two baskets, both successful. Wang Zhan also scored one basket, and Zheng Sen added two more points, making it 25 to 13. They seemed to be gaining momentum. However, halftime arrived, and the game resumed with even more intensity. The Police Brigade tried hard to break the deadlock, while Jinan did not relax at all. Both sides scored, and the situation was balanced at 37 to 23. The Police Brigade was still 12 points behind, but then Jinan's performance improved again, and the athletes from Central China fell into disarray.</p>
<p>Disparate Situation</p>
<p>Jinan relied on accurate shooting from all their players, and their score gradually increased. The Police Brigade only managed to score one basket through Yin Hongxiang, making the score 45 to 15, a difference of 20 points. Liu Zhenyuan, who had accomplished nothing, finally opened his scoring record. From then on, the score difference remained between 18 and 20 points. Xu Heng scored a basket, making it 57 to 35. Jinan had victory within their grasp. Han and Cai were successively substituted, entering the reserves. The Police Brigade struggled desperately, and Duan Zhuo scored two consecutive baskets, resulting in a final score of 57 to 39. The referees were Zhou Jia and Zhai Hongren. Tomorrow night, the Police Brigade will play against Donghua University.</p>

<h3>Xu Chengji Performance</h3>
<p>Defeats Xu Weipei in Hong Kong</p>

<h3>Far Eastern Games Tryout 10,000-Meter Champion, Sun Che's Coffin Transported to Jin</h3>
<p>Sun Che, a soldier of the Zhengtai Railway Protection Army in Shanxi, the 10,000-meter champion in the tryouts for last year's Far Eastern Games, was about to go to the Philippines to win glory for the country. Unfortunately, he contracted pneumonia and liver disease. He was treated at the Red Cross Hospital but unexpectedly passed away at midnight on May 24th. The whole country mourned. The Xie Jin Association took care of the funeral arrangements, and the coffin was kept at the Qilu Hall. It has been almost a year. Now, the regimental commander of his army's 1st regiment has sent the regiment's adjutant, Xie Qifeng, to Shanghai to contact the Xie Jin Association about taking the coffin back to Jin. The association sent someone to contact the China Travel Service to handle the arrangements, which have been completed. The transport is scheduled to begin today, via train to Beijing, then transferred to PingSui, and finally to Gaotang County, Shanxi, his hometown, for burial. Sun was 30 years old, from Gaotang County, Shanxi. He served in the army for five battles and was the deputy squad leader of the Zhengtai Railway Protection Army. He was of moderate height, amiable, and won the 10,000-meter championship at the previous North China Games in 36 minutes and 4 seconds. In last year's North China tryouts, he broke the national record with 34 minutes and seconds. At the national tryouts in Shanghai, he was selected as the representative for the Far Eastern Games with a time of 34 minutes and 4 seconds, setting a new national record. Such a genius, unfortunately, did not live long, which is deeply regrettable.</p>
<h3>East Asia Women's Basketball and Track and Field Team Tour South, Warmly Welcomed by Overseas Chinese</h3>
<p>Track and Field Chen Shuqing Sets New 100-Meter Record, Basketball Team Wins Almost Every Game with Superb Skill, Team Returns North with Great Reputation, Expected to Arrive in Shanghai on the 26th</p>
<p>(Singapore Correspondence) Shanghai East Asia Sports Academy, to promote women's sports and connect with overseas Chinese, responded to the invitation of the Singapore Chinese Basketball Association and organized a southern tour team. The team, including Principal Chen Mengyu, leader Li Huaifen, captain Qian Hangsu, vice-captain Wang Huachang, and players Xue Piwei, Chen Shuqing, Chen Liqing, Qin Chiming, Xu Yuan, Pan Jingxian, and Wang Yuying, a total of twelve people, arrived in Singapore on a French postal ship from Saigon on February 5th. They were warmly welcomed by overseas Chinese and performed basketball and track and field events, achieving excellent results. They also went to Malaysia and other places for competitions, with unprecedented enthusiasm. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Singapore Overseas Chinese Warmly Welcome</p>
<p>Since receiving the news of the East Asia Southern Tour Team's arrival in Singapore, the Singapore sports community has been actively welcoming them. Those who came to welcome included Lin Lingmin, chairman of the Singapore Chinese Basketball and Volleyball Association, Qiu Weijin, secretary-general, committee members Zheng Jieyang and Xi Yandao, the Chongzheng Alumni Association, the Amateur Sports Association, Overseas Chinese High School, Aitong Alumni Association, Weiyang Sports Association, Gongshang Alumni Association, Nanyang Girls' High School, Singapore Girls' High School, Chinese Sports Association, Chongwu Sports Association, and the school's alumni in Singapore, numbering in the hundreds. When the ship arrived, cheers erupted. Principal Chen shook hands with each welcomer. Compatriots from the motherland meeting in a foreign land experienced a joy that words cannot describe.</p>
<p>Sanjiang Guild Hall Hosts Tea Party</p>
<p>The Sanjiang Guild Hall, to connect with fellow villagers, held a tea party at its Dongling Gabizhi Road clubhouse at 10 AM on the 10th to express their welcome. The event began with a speech by Shi Shaozeng, the Chinese Consul General in Singapore, who said that the East Asia team's outstanding performances would give overseas Chinese a good understanding of the new national education in the motherland and provide them with a principle to emulate. He added that women's sports in the South Seas were generally backward and expressed hope that the East Asia team's visit would raise awareness among women in Singapore. Principal Chen of East Asia then gave a speech, reporting the purpose of the trip. Finally, Qian Hangsu thanked the audience in fluent Mandarin. The event ended around 12 PM. In addition, there were countless invitations to banquets, keeping them very busy.</p>
<p>Establishing a Special Committee for Competition Liaison</p>
<p>Since East Asia generously agreed to the southern tour, the Singapore Chinese Basketball and Volleyball Association has been preparing the competition schedule. For the convenience of the process, special committees were established, such as the East Asia and Singapore Track and Field Performance Committee, to handle all matters.</p>
<p>Numerous Cities in the South Seas Request Performances</p>
<p>Since the team's arrival, it has caused a sensation in the South Seas. Various cities have sent letters to Lin Aimin, chairman of the Singapore Chinese Association, requesting performances. To avoid disappointing overseas Chinese, the East Asia team has agreed to all requests. After performing basketball and track and field events in Singapore, they will go to Penang, Perak, Taiping Batu, and other places. When they appear, the audience is always packed. They greatly admire the team's artistry.</p>
<p>Track and Field Competition Sets National Record</p>
<p>At 1 PM on the afternoon of the 17th, the East Asia Singapore Men's and Women's Track and Field Performance Competition was held at the Singapore Amateur Football Association Stadium. There were over 1,000 spectators. Unfortunately, a light rain before the start dampened the audience's interest, otherwise, the entire venue would have been packed. Eight men's teams participated, but the results were mediocre. In addition to East Asia, twenty-one women were selected from Nanyang Girls' High School, Chinese Girls' High School, and Singapore Women's Sports School to participate for fun. East Asia has the nation's top athletes, and their results are far beyond what the women's teams in Nanyang can achieve. Miss Qian Hangsu, famous throughout the country, was injured in the ball game, greatly affecting her results. However, she still attended with her injuries, and the audience praised her excellent posture. In total, East Asia won first place in nine events. Chen Shuqing's 100-meter time of 13.4 seconds broke the national record, which was especially commendable. The overall results are as follows:</p>
<p>Event 1st Place 2nd Place 3rd Place Result</p>
<p>50 Feet Xian Shuqing Cao Hanhua Qian Hangsu 7.2 seconds</p>
<p>100 Meters Chen Shuqing Qian Hangsu Cao Hanhua 13.4 seconds (New)</p>
<p>Low Hurdles Qian Hangye Wang Huachang 15 seconds</p>
<p>Long Jump Qian Hangsu Chen Shuqing Chen Yu 4.42 meters</p>
<p>High Jump Wang Huachang Chen Jinxiang Pan Jingxian 1.24 meters</p>
<p>Javelin Xu Yuan Xue Zhengxia Wang Yingyu 27.2 meters</p>
<p>Baseball Throw Xu Yuan Xue Zhengxia Wang Yu 39.35 meters</p>
<p>Shot Put Xu Yuan Zheng Huiyue Chen Jinxiang 8.16 meters</p>
<p>Discus Wang Huachang Qin Chiming Bi Mei 22.85 meters</p>
<p>Basketball Games Win Almost Every Game</p>
<p>The East Asia basketball team's superb skills are especially admired by overseas Chinese. They played in Singapore, Malaysia, and other places. Except when passing through Malacca, where they unfortunately lost to the Pay Fong Men's Team 21 to 27 due to a lack of players, they won every other game. Xue Zhengxia and Chen Wanqing are praised throughout Nanyang. They have made great progress since their last visit. Others such as Qian Hangsu, Qin Chiming, Pan Jingxian, Wang Yuying, and Wang Huachang are also outstanding. The results of each game are compiled below:</p>
<p>(1) In Singapore, 25 to 28, win against South Men's Team</p>
<p>(2) In Singapore, 24 to 15, win against Nanyang Girls' High School</p>
<p>(3) In Singapore, 27 to 6, win against Chinese Girls' High School</p>
<p>(4) In Ipoh, 55 to 12, win against Shih Chung Chinese Girls' High School</p>
<p>(5) In Kuala Lumpur, 34 to 8, win against Kun Cheng</p>
<p>(6) In Kuala Lumpur, 4 to 6, win against Yu Hua United Team</p>
<p>(7) In Teng City, 34 to 2, win against Hua Nan Team</p>
<p>(8) In Malacca, 23 to 27, lost to Pay Fong Men's Team</p>
<p>(8) In Zhenzhu, 35 to 14, win against Chinese Sports Association</p>
<p>The Trip Was Not in Vain, Returning North with Great Reputation</p>
<p>In various performances, the East Asia team members' clothing is simple, their attitude is sincere, their skills are excellent, and their sportsmanship is exceptionally noble. They have no trace of the habits of current athletes, which gives the women of Nanyang a very deep impression. All sectors feel that the team's long journey across the ocean has been rewarding and they have experienced great hardship, so they have sent silver shields, velvet flags, etc., to commemorate the occasion. The team is scheduled to depart in early June and is expected to return to Shanghai on the 26th.</p>

<h3>Letters from Xiao Yishan, Liu Qiao, and Others Praising the "Ten Professors' Manifesto"</h3>
<p>Xiao Yishan Praises It as the Gospel Amidst National Decline; Liu Jieao Emphasizes the Impermissibility of Hesitating at the Crossroads</p>
<p>Recently, figures in domestic academic circles have paid close attention to the "Ten Professors' Manifesto." The China Social Problems Research Association in Nanjing has already initiated a series of Cultural Construction Symposiums, inviting Chen Lifu, He Bingsong, and 24 others to participate in discussions. Lin Liru, Dean of the Teachers College of Guang Dong Qinqin University, and Yang Lianggong, a supervisor of the Supervisory Yuan, also expressed to others that the principles of the manifesto are indeed unassailable, but hope that the ten professors who signed the manifesto can have further performance in how to achieve its realization so it is not just empty words. In addition, Xiao Yishan, professor of history at Peking University, and Liu Jieao, an economist studying in Berlin, recently wrote to their friends, mentioning the issue of China-centered cultural construction, and also expressed their expectations. The huge influence of the "Ten Professors' Manifesto" is even more evident. Attached below are the letters from Xiao and Liu:</p>
<p>Xiao Yishan's Letter: "You and other gentlemen lead the masses and construct a China-centered culture, which is truly the gospel amidst national decline. Looking up to the road ahead, I am filled with admiration. Mr. Lifu also discussed this matter in the past, believing that culture essentially has no distinction between East and West, old and new. From the perspective of their similarities, the round head and square feet are no different. From the perspective of their differences, the states of Qin and Yue also have different interests. Therefore, nature is the same and principle is also the same, customs are different and techniques are also different. Techniques have refinement and crudeness, so it is okay to learn from each other. Principles have no differences, so why must we imitate? Previous people were ignorant of the source of learning, and thus had the mistakes of self-imposed closure and blind imitation. Recently, the atmosphere has slightly shifted, but I am afraid that those who are rigidly attached to the past may be equivalent to the faults of recklessness and dismemberment. In the 18th year of the Republic, I founded the College of Literature, History, and Politics, with the aim of promoting Chinese culture. Although the influence was great at the time, the results were small, and I had long anticipated that there would be today. However, how can we revive the extinct and continue the interrupted, so that the false does not confuse the true? I hope you can add to this idea."</p>
<p>Liu Jieao's Letter: "Recently, I read in the newspaper about the manifesto issued by you and other gentlemen. After carefully examining it, I was pleasantly surprised. Recalling my days in Europe, I often discussed the issue of Eastern and Western culture with several friends, all of whom believed that our country's cultural policy, after hesitating at the crossroads and being deeply poisoned, urgently needed a re-examination, a change of strategy, and a new beginning. After returning to China, I gathered many like-minded people and loudly appealed to seek advice from domestic scholars. Unexpectedly, the ten professors' manifesto completely coincided with the intentions of myself and others. This proves that the truth is where everyone has the same feeling. During my two years in Europe, I realized from my daily observations that although Western culture has its advantages, if we disregard our national conditions and transplant them one by one, the result will not only not help the current difficulties, but will also be the source of the demise of our Chinese nation. Fortunately, you and other gentlemen have made a high-profile call, and the whole country has responded. From now on, we will change course and move towards the future of a national-centered culture. I know that in a few years, the whole country will definitely have a thriving atmosphere. I have no in-depth research on this issue, but my intuitive understanding may also be of reference. If I have spare time, I plan to write an article to seek opinions."</p>

<p>Contribution Speech</p>
<h3>Review of National Goods Exports</h3>
<p>— Yang Mang</p>
<p>The fate of national goods this year is plagued by the decline of the rural economy internally, and pressured by the global economic recession externally. The path is becoming narrower and narrower, which is undeniably true. However, the rebirth of national goods in Southeast Asia is indeed the only way out. Our national goods manufacturers should unite to promote the export of national goods. According to the returning Southeast Asian investigators, the biggest difficulties in promotion are: exchange rates, transportation, insurance, etc., all of which are controlled by others. The heavy interest on mortgage loans and the losses suffered by tariffs are relatively inferior. National goods are lagging behind in every aspect. This is a matter that the national goods industry should quickly think of ways to use national unity to open up this export path, which is not to be delayed. The reporter believes that in addition to the above problems, there is one of the most important things that the national goods industry has not paid attention to and has long lost the trust of overseas Chinese merchants in Southeast Asia, which is the lack of selection of goods. General vendors arbitrarily transport shoddy goods to Southeast Asia in the name of national goods. These overseas Chinese merchants initially purchased them with enthusiasm, but what they bought were inferior goods, which not only became short-tempered, but also became discouraged. They are the real enemies of national goods. Therefore, I believe that in the future, our national goods manufacturers should jointly form an inspection agency through the same industry association, recruit experts, and use their technology. All export goods must undergo strict inspection and careful review in order to restore lost credibility and open up new paths for the future. This matter is extremely important and should not be solely dependent on the government, regarded as a formality, or well-intentioned but entrusted to the wrong people, turning it into a source of profit. Mr. Zhang Gongquan said: "To promote national goods, everyone must work hard in the future and do it themselves." This is indeed what our national goods industry should pay attention to.</p>
<h3>National Goods Movement Goes to the Family</h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>In the current era, I believe that the only way for national goods is to use economic methods to achieve the most effective results! What is the economic method? ——The national goods movement goes to the family!</p>
<p>Three or four years ago, when I went to the countryside, I often saw women making straw hats as their side business. If this method is used in the manufacture of national goods, then the results will be very significant. Because ordinary national goods factories must build steel-concrete factory buildings before manufacturing goods, and hire many office staff. If these expenses are eliminated, there is only one way to bring the national goods movement into the family!</p>
<p>A friend who studied in Japan told me that the reason why Japan's light industry is so developed is because their costs are low. Why are their costs low? Government protection is certainly a major reason, but the development of family factories is the biggest reason.</p>
<p>Then some readers may wonder, now is the machine world. If the family industry method is implemented, I am afraid that the handicraft industry will be revived. Isn't this a step backward?</p>
<p>I believe that family factories do not only use manual labor. Machines can also be used, but that requires two or three households to cooperate. Moreover, what I am talking about is small industry. When it comes to large-scale industries, it is necessary to set up factories! But large capital is run by the country. Let me give you an analogy: In the struggle between national goods and foreign goods, large industry is like artillery, heavy machine guns, and small industry is like rifles and hand grenades. In the current economic downturn in China, I hope to add more rifles and hand grenades, and we will choose the convenient ones to do! The organization of family factories is the meaning of this!</p>
<p>I saw a women's magazine talking about the decline of Chinese women. Bourgeois women are anesthetized in singing and dancing halls, middle-class women are gambling and having fun at home, and there are still many Noras wandering in the wrong path, working as vase-style female clerks. Are women really declining? Quickly come back from the path of extinction and take the path of family factories!</p>
<p>This year is the Student National Goods Year. I hope the education community will seriously promote this and encourage this major task of "family factories"!</p>
<h3>Group Wedding and Promoting National Goods</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The first New Life Group Wedding Ceremony in Shanghai will be held at 3:00 PM on April 3rd in the auditorium of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Fifty-eight young men and women will get married under the goal of thrift. This is truly a groundbreaking and unprecedented event! At the same time, our country's famous Maya Silk Factory is taking advantage of this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to specially weave men's and women's silk dress styles for the general groom and bride. The male dress gown material is priced at 15 yuan for Grade A and 12 yuan for Grade B. The female dress material is priced at 5 yuan and 6 jiao for Grade A and 4 yuan and 5 jiao for Grade B. The veil rent is 1 yuan and 5 jiao per set. After inspecting the prices, they are still considered cheap. In addition, in order to promote domestically produced silk, it has been approved by the Social Affairs Bureau. I think that not only men's and women's dresses can take advantage of this opportunity to achieve great results! Other items such as Sanyou Society's Hehuan pillows, towels, menstrual belts, children's bibs, as well as men's Zhongshan suits, Xiaohuayuan's women's shoes, Family Industry Society's Butterfly Cream, etc... can be advertised at half price and sold to the young men and women in the group wedding. It is tantamount to jointly promoting group weddings on the one hand, and effectively promoting national goods, reducing imports, preventing the outflow of silver, and quickly selling national goods at low profits! The impression of national goods on young men and women is getting deeper and deeper. Why wouldn't merchants be happy to do so?</p>
<h3>Things That the National Goods Industry Should Pay Attention To</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>When it comes to promoting the national goods movement, I believe that consumers should naturally make their best efforts to use and purchase national goods. However, from another perspective, the national goods production industry should also seize the opportunity to use this to establish a psychological foundation for national goods production that will forever be believed by the Chinese people. In this way, consumers and producers will cooperate practically. Then, our Chinese national goods movement will naturally achieve good results and reach the point of success. This is a certain truth. I think everyone should understand this very well!</p>
<p>However, it is unfortunate that after years of the national goods movement and the unanimous advocacy and publicity from top to bottom, producers and consumers seem to be more aware. However, as I see it, there are still two things that the national goods production industry should pay attention to and should really pay attention to (the things that consumers should pay attention to are not within the scope of discussion in this article, so I will not mention them much). Because this has a great influence on the future of the entire national goods movement, I will write about it below for discussion with the national goods production industry!</p>
<p>(1) The same industry should abolish the policy of cheap competition - The same industry and the same industry should have been united. How to study promotion methods? How to determine the price of goods! This should be discussed with the same industry in advance. However, what is the current situation of the national goods production industry? Alas! Besides cheap competition and internal strife in the same industry, what else can be said? This is a very serious crisis. An industrialist said: "Cheap competition is the death of national goods." It is truly sincere! I hope that the same industry and the same industry will quickly wake up and organize the same industry group or the same industry association, or joint business office to remedy this shortcoming. For example, the match industry has organized a joint association, and the enamel industry also has a joint business office. Recently, the steel product industry and the seasoning industry have also established the same industry group and the joint business office. This is a very good phenomenon, which can avoid internal strife and the occurrence of cheap competition in the same industry. I think: Other industries in the national goods production industry really need to pay attention urgently.</p>
<p>(2) Production should absolutely avoid shoddy production. To gain the trust of consumers in national goods, the first thing to do is to make the goods reliable. What is reliable means that there is absolutely no shoddy component mixed in. This is also a very important thing. Regarding the future of goods promotion, it is very important and large. The national goods production industry in our country has been able to pay attention to this, but there are still some producers who cannot avoid shoddy production. This should be very careful) This matter is not only related to the psychology of consumers. At the same time, it can also cause a bad impression among the same industry. From a broader perspective, it has a great impact on the sacrificial national goods movement. At this time when the national goods movement is flourishing, the author hopes that the national goods production industry will pay close attention to it.</p>
<p>The author believes that the above two points are what the national goods production industry should actively pay attention to at present. Therefore, I am using the position of the National Goods Weekly to study with the production industry.</p>
<p>Visitation Notes</p>
<h3>Investigation Notes on Kunming Winery</h3>
<p>— Ji Yu</p>
<p>Opening history, Chinese people have had a glorious page in industry. Silk tea porcelain etc. all held the highest position in the world in the past. We can admit that Chinese people are smart and hard-working. This cleverness and hard work can open up a promising road for industry as long as the bad habits of conservatism are eliminated.</p>
<p>In an era where these conservative bad habits are still growing luxuriantly, it is really not easy to see a factory that is thoroughly reformed and seeks progress, but now I have actually seen a Kunming Winery.</p>
<p>The Kunming Winery is located on Kunming Road and covers a large area. Currently, they only produce soy sauce temporarily. There were a total of five people who went to visit this time, based on a friend's introduction.</p>
<p>Following the doorman, we stepped into the reception room. Then, a Mr. Mao came to greet us. We sat in the reception room for a while, and then visited various places under the guidance of Mr. Mao.</p>
<p>The first place we arrived at was the laboratory. There, at the appropriate temperature, many types of yeast were cultured in various instruments. Mr. Mao told us: "Yeast is very important for making soy sauce. This kind of bacteria is like workers, doing the most important and impossible step for us. The distilleries do not select the best type of yeast from among the many types of yeast to use, but simply expose the raw materials to the air, allowing any type of bacteria to take on the manufacturing duties, so the products cannot be improved. This house of ours is an important work to find the best kind of bacteria other than the soy sauce made by chemical experiments.</p>
<p>Secondly, Mr. Mao led us to the fermentation place. It was a series of narrow and long houses. The temperature was very high. Wooden shelves were placed on both sides, and wooden trays were placed in the trays, all filled with the raw materials that were fermenting,——beans. Fermentation will release carbon dioxide gas, and because it is convenient for fermentation, there are only two ventilation holes left, so we came out in a short time, and then went to a very large house.</p>
<p>This room is special. It is all made of cement large square tanks, with walkways between the tanks. There is an empty tank in one corner of the room, so Mr. Mao pointed to it and said to us: "After the fermentation is completed, salty brine is obtained by using specific gravity, and it is first placed in this tank, and then put down these fermented beans. There is a pipe inside the tank, which is connected to water vapor. The water vapor has a temperature of 100 degrees Celsius, which is high enough than the temperature of ordinary sunlight, so we make soy sauce. We do not need to expose it to the sun like in distilleries. In addition to the fact that flies and dust will not mix into the soy sauce and hygienic conditions are obtained, we can still use water vapor to pass through this pipe at night to make the output rapid."</p>
<p>Walking out of this room and turning the corner, we saw a huge hydraulic press. Using a hydraulic press can squeeze out more soy sauce than the old-fashioned press. Their costs are also lower because of this. According to Mr. Mao, their soy sauce is now sold well not only in this city but also in other cities such as Hankou. In the future, they will also make wine.</p>
<p>When we walked out of the Kunming Winery, I kept thinking in my heart: Chinese people are smart and can work hard. This cleverness and hard work can open up a promising road for industry as long as the bad habits of conservatism are eliminated.</p>
<h3>Historical Materials on National Products</h3>
<p>— Sun Chouchang</p>
<p>The electric fans used in the past were all imported goods. Since the Hua Sheng Electric Appliance Factory manufactured its own electric fans, their effectiveness has surpassed that of imported goods, while their price is much lower. Therefore, Chinese people all advocate using domestic products, which saves a considerable amount of financial resources each year. The founder of the factory, Mr. Yang Jichuan, had not studied electrical engineering before entering school. All his electrical knowledge was obtained through his talent, and the results were even better than those of students who studied abroad. This shows that our country's industrial technology is not inferior to others, but unfortunately, no one promotes it. Therefore, I am publishing in this journal the five-character律 poem and preface presented to him by his elder brother, Yang Yuzhan, the other day, which he recorded in the tenth month of 1927, regarding Mr. Jichuan's new invention of electric fans, to add luster to the national products industry.</p>
<p>When I was young, I stayed at home and had not studied Western learning. Later, I went to Shanghai for trade and bought a book called "Essentials of Electricity" to learn gilding for amusement. Unexpectedly, this led to a sudden realization, and I understood the science of electricity thoroughly. I also naturally understood Western mathematics without a teacher. So I founded an electrical appliance factory in Hongkou, Shanghai, named Hua Sheng. Not only did I make many inventions in electricity, but I also understood the subtle details of various machines as clearly as if I were looking at a fire. Not only were foreign engineers inferior to me, but also foreign students who knew me often wrote letters to ask for my guidance. In the past, electric light factories were often stolen of electricity, but there was no way to investigate or prevent it. Later, I invented a limiting meter, which eliminated this drawback, and now all electric light factories benefit from it. Recently, I invented a fan that saves more electricity and has stronger power than imported products, while also reducing the price. As a result, it sells well in all provinces, and we cannot supply enough. There are many other inventions, all of which have been effective. Was I born with this knowledge? Or did I learn it? I cannot decide. The poem says: "The machine's heart is not used at all, and one gains complete success in learning from the ancients. This path must be given by heaven; who else is like you? Holding a cup, I ask the moon from afar; lying on a mat, the wind arises by itself. How many new things I have seen! My thoughts in the clear river are endless."</p>
<h3>Introducing Wuxi's Yuan Grass Carpets</h3>
<p>— Lü Bin</p>
<p>From an economic standpoint, with the current bankruptcy of Chinese rural areas and the decline of cities, all industries are withering, and a gloomy atmosphere permeates our surroundings. Advocating the purchase and use of domestic products, developing national production, and promoting national capital are the urgent tasks, the essential strategies for economic recovery, and the major actions to save the crisis. However, although general domestic products come from domestic factories, most of the raw materials still need to be purchased from foreign merchants. As a result, they have to go through another layer of exploitation, and the price is inevitably more expensive. It is still somewhat difficult for the people when purchasing power is weak. Naturally, it is best to use domestic raw materials to manufacture purely authentic domestic products.</p>
<p>The farm of the Jiangsu Provincial Education Institute in Wuxi, in view of the economic decline of our country's rural areas, should urgently seek salvation. In addition to improving seeds and planting methods for crops, it also promotes rural side businesses, such as rural crafts, which are also an important part. At the same time, it trains students in these skills and directly teaches the general public in various public education experimental areas, with remarkable results. All raw materials are domestic products, which avoids heavy exploitation. And the cost can be reduced, and sales are easy and widespread. For example, the yuan grass carpets are manufactured with extraordinary sophistication, with many patterns, and are very elegant for laying in halls and living rooms (see picture). The author specially visited Mr. Guo Yiquan, a rural arts and crafts teacher at the Institute, yesterday and was told the following:</p>
<p>"The Rural Arts and Crafts Training Institute of our institute's farm and the Rural Arts and Crafts Training Institute jointly established with the Beixia Public Education Experimental Area teach rural villagers and women to use their spare time to carefully make various brick-shaped carpets. The raw material is yuan grass from Hushu Pass, Suzhou, which is completely authentic domestic product. Whether it is a Chinese-style hall or a Western-style living room, using this kind of carpet as an embellishment is not only beautiful but also durable and useful. As for the size, it can be made according to the buyer's wishes. Now that we are shouting for rural revitalization, our work may be beneficial!"</p>
<p>When Mr. Guo talked to me, he immediately took out the finished yuan grass carpets for me to see. There were various patterns, and the yuan grass was dyed in red, blue, green, yellow, and other colors. It is said that each square foot is priced at only eighteen cents, which is many times cheaper than foreign felt carpets!</p>
<p>I heard that the Wuxi Civilian Vocational Training Center also produces this kind of yuan grass carpet, and many people in the market use it. I would like to introduce it here together, hoping that patriotic gentlemen and those who promote domestic products can buy and use it more, wouldn't it be possible to slightly supplement the national economy?</p>

<h3>Talking About Foolish Hard Work</h3>
<p>— Jiang Jiping</p>
<p>In Daudet's "Letters from My Mill," I saw many excellent essays. One of them, "Master Cornille's Secret," describes the tenacity and indomitable spirit of a flour miller, which can well represent the spirit of Westerners' foolish hard work. He said that when France's industry was not developed, when steam engines had not yet been invented, many mills used wind power to grind flour, so hard-working people could obtain abundant food and clothing. Every Sunday, the mill owners happily took out fragrant wine to entertain guests, and the housewives were also dressed beautifully, wearing golden crosses, and everyone played the flute and danced. But later, people from Paris came to that place and established a steam flour mill. The wages were cheaper, and the flour was ground faster, so everyone sent their wheat to be ground there. This robbed a lot of business from the windmills, so everyone could not maintain their business and closed their doors one after another. Some went to do other businesses, and some became destitute. The mill owners could no longer take out fragrant wine to entertain guests, and the housewives no longer had leisure time to dress up. This lively place suddenly became unusually desolate. Among these closed mills, only one was still open, and its windmill was still circling in the sky. This was Master Cornille's mill. It wasn't just for a day, everyone suspected whose wheat was being brought to him to grind? But Cornille was very diligent, every day he drove a donkey carrying two bags of wheat and sent it to his own mill, but he didn't let anyone in. Even when he wasn't in the mill, he kept the door tightly closed, as if he was afraid that someone would steal a grain of his wheat. Unexpectedly, one day, he forgot to close his mill door, and several children went in to take a look. There was no wheat there. The original book describes the expressions of these children when they first entered the mill very well. It says: "Strange! The milling room was empty, there wasn't a single bag, not a single grain of wheat; there wasn't any flour dust on the walls and spider webs, and even the warm fragrance of crushed wheat that was usually in the mill couldn't be smelled. The grinding bed was covered with dust, and the big skinny cat was sleeping on it. The inner room also had the same atmosphere of abandonment and poverty: a broken bed, a few sets of broken clothes, a piece of bread on the stone steps, and three or four broken bags in a corner, with some lime and powder soil leaking out of the bags." Cornille's secret was discovered. It turned out that what his donkey was carrying was lime. The children spread this secret throughout the village, and the old flour miller sat in his mill and cried. It turned out that he worked so hard to do this in order to win some glory for the mill. Everyone was moved by his sincerity and sent wheat to him to grind. After that, the mill continued to operate until Cornille died, and then the windmill of the mill stopped. In our view, what he did was close to madness, or a kind of mental illness caused by excessive stimulation, but in fact, it was a very strong will, a spirit of resistance. Many Western scientists and entrepreneurs have succeeded because of this kind of foolish spirit. This is not affectation, not foolishness, but strong effort. When Chinese people encounter failure, they think that there is no hope at all, sacrifice everything, and become depressed for the rest of their lives. When they encounter people doing such foolish hard work, they even laugh at them, so they never succeed. This article seems like a joke, but it really inspires us a lot.</p>
<h3>The Valley of Miasma</h3>
<p>— Wu Yan</p>
<p>It was only the second month of the lunar calendar, but the weather in the valley was terribly hot and stuffy, as if it were already the hottest days of summer.</p>
<p>The reeds by the roadside were thick and hard, and if you weren't careful, they would simply prick your legs and feet.</p>
<p>Although flies don't eat people, when you see them suddenly pounce on your face, you feel afraid, as if they are going to bite off the flesh on your face.</p>
<p>At that time, I was taking wandering travel as my main form of entertainment, so when I walked to such a place, of course, I felt particularly interested. I planned to slow down my pace and use curious eyes to search and gather some things that I had never seen before. However, my travel companion, whom I had met on the mountain road the day before, a suspicious fellow who claimed to be a businessman but had no goods, showed a fearful look. He turned his head, wrinkled his thick eyebrows, and urged me:</p>
<p>"Walk faster! Walk faster!... Do you know what place this is?"</p>
<p>"Of course, I know. ... What kind of flower is that?... Don't worry, will anyone rob you or me?"</p>
<p>I had long guessed that in this place with steep mountains and dangerous valleys, bandit grandpas were inevitably present to some extent. A vagabond with empty hands, what was there to worry about, only caring about staring blankly at a tree three or four zhang tall that was all red flowers near by.</p>
<p>"Ghost flowers!... I'm telling you, I'm not talking about those who rob people, young man!"</p>
<p>He pulled the package that was approaching his waist up to his back, took a few steps, and then answered me in a tone that was almost scolding, as if he were an old man, but he was actually only about thirty years old. I couldn't help but feel a little unhappy. I still walked slowly, glancing casually at the roadside, saying something that was not quite a question:</p>
<p>"Then,... what is there to be afraid of?... Are you afraid of not being able to reach the shop before dark?"</p>
<p>"Humph, haven't you heard people say? There's miasma in this valley.... Hurry up, hurry up, it'll come out when it gets dark...."</p>
<p>"Ah!"</p>
<p>He heard me exclaim in surprise and spoke energetically, as if to make me admire his experienced words even more.</p>
<p>"People say that the miasma in this valley is released by a toad spirit, understand? A toad spirit. On rainy days, the horse drivers have seen it, guess, hey, wait a minute, guess, what does it look like?"</p>
<p>He even stopped and began to quiz me.</p>
<p>"Let's go! Isn't it just an ugly big toad?... Have you forgotten the miasma?"</p>
<p>I waved my hand at him, as if urging him to hurry forward.</p>
<p>His feet immediately and instinctively sped up, but his mouth was still speaking excitedly.</p>
<p>"A big toad? No! A beautiful girl in red clothes! Standing on the roots of a yellow fruit tree, combing her black hair, combing it, mom, how charming!... "</p>
<p>"Why don't we go see her tonight? Such a charming thing!"</p>
<p>Not really believing these kinds of things, I said something to tease him.</p>
<p>"Um, are you not afraid of losing your life!... Those who can see her, how can they still live?"</p>
<p>"What? Does she eat people?"</p>
<p>"She doesn't bother to eat you! You haven't even gotten close to her, and you'll be poisoned by the miasma she spits out!"</p>
<p>"Then, how do you know she's a woman in red clothes?"</p>
<p>"Hey, didn't I tell you it was someone else who told me?"</p>
<p>"What! Is he still alive? Didn't you say that if you saw her, you would die?"</p>
<p>"Ha, how can you be so stupid? He also heard it from someone else!"</p>
<p>I didn't like continuing the playful questioning, because human beings are inherently good at lying and also good at believing lies, so I silently admitted that I was stupid.</p>
<p>"Also, the miasma of Lujiang Dam is different."</p>
<p>He bent down to tidy up the loose straps of the straw sandals on his feet. When he straightened up, he began this sentence, but he didn't go on, as if waiting for me to urge him: "Then what is it like?" However, I didn't speak, only caring about burying my head and continuing on my way.</p>
<p>"I'm telling you, it's a black fish spirit in the river...."</p>
<p>He finally continued to speak. In my heart, I thought: "Thank you, I didn't ask you to tell me!" He spoke as he walked, and unconsciously slowed down. Sometimes, if I didn't tell him to hurry up, he would stop on the road and let his mouth move alone.</p>
<p>The mountains around the valley were very high. By mid-afternoon, the sun had disappeared long ago, leaving only the unbearable stuffy heat. We both unbuttoned our buttons, opened our chests, and let the sweat from our wet shirts escape. I was afraid that I wouldn't be able to reach the mountains to stay overnight tonight, and that I would have to spend the night outdoors in the valley, and let the miasma torment me, so I repeatedly turned back and urged him:</p>
<p>"It's getting dark, walk faster, wouldn't it be better to talk about it at the shop over there?"</p>
<p>"Okay, okay." (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Visit to the Oriental Culture Institute (Part 2)</h3>
<p>— Lan Ru</p>
<p>The first thing we saw was the antiquities exhibition room on the third floor.</p>
<p>Walking into this room was just like walking into the Palace Museum in Beiping. There were ancient coins, ancient costumes, ancient tiles, ancient mirrors, ancient hairpins, ancient swords, ancient bricks... from various dynasties in ancient China, everything that one could wish for. Books that they copied according to ancient Chinese versions were displayed here, including "Wen Xuan," "Historical Records," "Book of Rites," "Mao Shi," "Confucius' Family Sayings," etc. Among the many picture albums, I discovered a picture album titled "Commemorative Publication of the Manchurian National Fengtian Museum," and immediately all the blood in my body boiled up, as if I had been greatly insulted, and I had no intention of turning the pages any further.</p>
<p>After coming out of here, we visited the book storage room.</p>
<p>This was a seven-story book storage building. Although each floor was only about twenty shop mats in area, the equipment inside was too strange! The bookshelves were all steel, and the stairs, floorboards, and surrounding walls were all iron. It is said that the reason for building it like this was entirely for fire prevention.</p>
<p>Because the Research Institute had only been established for a year, there were not that many books stored inside. Many bookshelves were empty. The gentleman told us that the total number of books currently stored was only 70,000, half of which were Chinese books, just 35,000.</p>
<p>Originally, one could take the elevator to the book building, but because we wanted to visit, we had to trouble our two legs. When everyone's footsteps came into contact with the iron stairs, they made a piano-like sound, which was extremely interesting. Everyone quietly listened to this rhythmic music and forgot the fatigue of going upstairs.</p>
<p>On each floor, there was a young man in his twenties sitting there writing book slips or sorting books. When he saw us, he always stood up and smiled and bowed to us. The Japanese people's research spirit is really admirable. Some ancient books that were so rotten that they had no words were completely new after they were copied by them. They used uniform covers for binding, which looked very neat and beautiful.</p>
<p>After visiting the painting library, we were led to the ancient book reproduction office and the photography room. The camera used was the latest Japanese model, like a microscope, which could magnify something as small as a speck of dust to a few feet, which made it very convenient to reproduce ancient books.</p>
<p>Later, we also visited the conference room, the joint research room, the lecture room, etc. In the joint research room, we saw regular publications from various universities in China, as well as "Jiu Tong," "Twenty-Four Histories," and maps of various provinces in China. The gentleman also told us that a Chinese gentleman named Ba Xiangyin was teaching them Chinese for two hours every week.</p>
<p>It is said that there are also certain restrictions on the researchers here. Those who are not doctors are not qualified to come to study. The chairman of the board is Hattori Unokichi. Including the directors and staff of the office, library, and photography department, there are a total of more than 40 people. The salary of each person is at least 110 yuan per month and at most 300 yuan. The research topics are different for each person, and the time when the research starts and ends is also stipulated. They are currently studying: the study of "Chu Ci" literature, the material culture of ancient northern ethnic groups in China, the study of the Liao and Jin dynasties, the study of Confucian governance, the study of "Zuo Zhuan," the history of medieval Chinese currency, and the history of thought in the Wei, Jin, Southern and Northern Dynasties.</p>
<p>The Kyoto and Tokyo Research Institutes publish one volume of the "Oriental Studies Report" every year, and most of the content is the research reports of the researchers.</p>
<p>On the way back, everyone was silent, lowered their heads, and walked quietly on the small stones. I thought that everyone's minds might be filled with more thoughts than small stones, but there should be one thing in common, right?</p>
<p>"Why have all of China's cultures gone into their libraries?"</p>
<h3>People and Books</h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>Goldfish</p>
<p>Because the children like goldfish, I also seem to have developed a bit of interest in this aspect. However, the children do not know how to raise goldfish, and I, from morning to night, am walking around without stopping. Therefore, the goldfish that come to my house either turn from "alive" to "dead" or from "vermilion" to "white." This has happened more than once. In addition, there is another danger: one of the children is very fond of dissecting creatures. Of course, he is not willing to let go of the goldfish lightly. Often, when no one is in the hall, he secretly takes the live goldfish out of the tank and takes it to the ground outside the door, where he slowly dissects it with a small knife all by himself. No matter how much you try to persuade him, it is always ineffective. Since last year, we have no longer raised goldfish, although whenever I see goldfish carriers or pass by goldfish stalls, I still want to move the idea. Not long ago, in a used bookstore, I saw a manuscript from the Kangxi period, titled "Classic of Red Fish," written by a Suzhou man who studied the life of goldfish for 30 years. It divides goldfish into 56 major categories, scientifically explaining each category and writing many methods for raising goldfish and collecting their eggs, etc. Due to the past relationship with goldfish, and because this book has no printed version and the asking price was only 40 cents, I bought it. Later, Mr. Zhenduo came south and saw this manuscript. He also said that he had never seen a printed version and proved from the changes that it was the original manuscript, and I was even more interested.</p>

<h3>War Miscellany (7)</h3>
<p>— Written by Tokunaga Sunao, translated by Ye Yin</p>
<p>But Ah Yuan's mother, who lived by collecting rent grain, greeted you with her nose, simply ignoring you. This made my mother tremble with anger. She gave up on herself, complained, and wildly pulled me on the spot, making me cry out in pain. However, Ah Yuan's mother did not come to dissuade her.</p>
<p>I played alone more often. And, I always thought: "Grandpa will definitely become rich when he comes back." Unless I was with my sisters, otherwise, whether it was picking berries, catching snails (eating roasted snails, the taste is very good), or picking bamboo nuts, etc., I went alone.</p>
<p>My father never came back. Gradually, there were people returning in triumph, but my uncle and father still had not returned.</p>
<p>At this time, I had a lover.</p>
<p>Leaving the group of boys, I played with the girls together with my sister.</p>
<p>That girl's name was Huimei. On the tall stone wall opposite my house, there was a huge tile house connected to a basement. That family was considered a big wealthy family in the village among the old families. Huimei was their only and youngest daughter. She was a stubborn child, but she had a mature and strong side. I remember that she was eight years old at that time, one year older than me.</p>
<p>A seven-year-old child should not have any sexual desire, but I was quite clearly aware of love. Needless to say, Huimei seemed to be the same way. The two of us often played while hiding from the groups of boys and girls.</p>
<p>Once, we were found by the group of boys. The two of us were</p>
<h3>The Beiping Triangle Love Tragedy Murder Case</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>The number of disputes arising from love among modern Chinese youths is truly countless. Those that go unnoticed are naturally impossible to know. The number revealed daily by newspapers is already unbelievably high. The seriousness of this issue in male-female relationships is very worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Recently, another triangle love tragedy occurred in Beiping, with very serious circumstances. From all perspectives, this cannot be said to be anything other than an unfortunate social reality. The murderer in the tragedy, Liu Jinggui, is a student at Beiping's Beihua Art School, 24 years old, from Xuanhua. In 1932, he fell in love with the physical educationist Yu Ming (also from Xuanhua, 34 years old, a graduate of Shanghai Jiaotong University) and they got engaged. Subsequently, during the North China Games, he met Teng Shuang (from Zhaoyang, Hunan, 29 years old, a graduate of Beiping Women's Normal University). Consequently, in the spring of 1933, he broke off the engagement with Liu and married Teng. Liu harbored deep resentment as a result, and this time, he killed Teng to vent his anger.</p>
<p>When we slightly research the whole story of this tragedy, we immediately feel that the blame for the tragedy really focuses on Yu Ming alone. The reason is that Yu was originally a man with a wife, yet he subsequently fell in love with two women, and both times got engaged. He treated love and engagement as a child's play, a fact that is very obvious. Since Yu was unwilling to grow old with his first wife, and then fell in love with Liu Jinggui, he should have divorced his first wife and married Liu, and everything would have been resolved. But Yu was naturally fond of the new and tired of the old, and disregarded his engagement with Liu, and fell in love with Teng Shuang again, and proceeded to get married. Therefore, Liu felt unwilling and harbored thoughts of revenge, and resolutely came out and killed Teng to resolve his long-held resentment. Therefore, in the creation of this tragedy, Yu cannot escape primary responsibility.</p>
<p>As for Liu Jinggui's behavior, it is also inevitably too extreme. Since Yu had already been engaged to Liu, and then married Teng, then Liu's abandonment was Yu's fault, not Teng's; this reasoning is very clear. Now, Liu committed this crime, killing Teng. His mistaken behavior is also unforgivable. Furthermore, since Yu fell in love with Teng, he already intended to abandon Liu, so he discussed breaking off the engagement with Liu. If Liu had been unwilling to break off the engagement at the time, he could have legally and vigorously negotiated with Yu. But since Liu didn't do this, and readily agreed to cancel the agreement, then Liu could also allow them their freedom and go find his own way out. Then nothing would have happened. Who knew that Liu's lingering affection was not broken, he resented Yu extremely, and ultimately resolved to kill Teng to vent the resentment in his chest. Liu's crime of intentional homicide is also deserved.</p>
<p>The one deserving our sympathy is Teng Shuang alone. She was sacrificed at the hands of a rival in love because of love disputes, which is really very unjust. However, Teng was not cautious enough in engaging in a relationship with Yu earlier, and there is inevitably some fault. Perhaps this is the source of her death today.</p>
<h3>Private Diary of a Woman</h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>Thinking repeatedly for an entire night, my nerves felt like they were being pounded by a sharp, stubborn iron pestle. When the turmoil was intense, my heart felt like it had been shattered by a dumdum bullet. Throughout the night, amidst the crowing of chickens and the ticking of the clock, I pondered and pondered. Then, a final determination drove me: at dawn, I decided to leave.</p>
<p>What else could I do but leave? In this rotten social stratum, when the economic foundation, which is the main tool for human liberation, still rests solely with men, the fate of women being toyed with and humiliated is ultimately unavoidable. But, unbearable humiliation and being toyed with are the most potent spiritual poisons for humans with special inspiration.</p>
<p>Could it be that when the times have developed to the forefront of the twentieth century, when humans are flaunting their own culture, there are still people who consider playing with women who have grown up in an unreasonable society and lost their economic ability as reasonable, pleasurable, and pleasing to the eye?</p>
<p>It's really something that makes people think about it for three days and nights, what kind of era is this? What kind of era is it? Is it civilized, cruel, or so insignificant that it can hardly be recorded on a page of history, a bizarre era that cannot be seen?</p>
<p>The riddle of this bizarre era is only known by ghosts!</p>
<p>However, no matter what, it's simply impossible to endure insults that humans cannot endure.</p>
<p>(Perhaps it's because I recognize a few characters: perhaps it's because of the oppression of adolescence, which is most prone to crime? When I broke away from the old shell of the so-called "family" in a corrupt and stubborn atmosphere, I had no chance to consider, and was pushed into the wild waves of society.</p>
<p>What greeted me was the clamor, insults, and the attacks of hunger, which is one of the instincts of mankind, between people.</p>
<p>Then a caring friend said to me!</p>
<p>—In this society, it is impossible for a woman to escape the shame of being toyed with and find a piece of bread or two to chew; women are most likely to starve to death, but women are also most unlikely to starve to death—like you, you are young, and with your youthful smile, you can already exchange it for luxurious enjoyment and have more than enough. Why do you have to suffer the pain of hunger under the deceptive slogan of "independence"? Fool!</p>
<p>But, I am young, with a hot, clean, and bright-loving heart. I have the courage to control my life. So I refuted my friend's words with youthful enthusiasm and condemned them as cowardly and humble.</p>
<p>Is the world really like that? Who believes it?</p>
<p>However, whether you believe it or not, the facts finally gradually unfolded. Several experiences of aimless wandering, insults, and hunger scared me. Finally, in a spirit of self-abandonment, like countless weak women, I took marriage as a job to relieve hunger, and sold my youthful smile, soul, and body wholesale in exchange for a rotten heart and the continuation of life.</p>
<p>When I was first caught in someone else's hands, I was perhaps being toyed with out of kindness(?): but later, because the other person had money, the other person had the mentality of a "young master": so, in times of displeasure, in times of turmoil, in times of boredom, in all times when it was not appropriate to pretend to be charming, I began to be scolded like a slave.</p>
<p>—Bitch! Cheap thing!</p>
<p>And for example, yesterday, because I didn't smile in a way that catered to the other person's preferences, I was slapped!)</p>
<p>And this slap may end my life, but it may also help me start a new life?</p>
<p>Suicide? Why bother? Suicide under the golden "young master" is more shameful than any humble act. So, I thought for a night and decided to leave at dawn.</p>
<p>But: where to go?</p>
<p>When will the sky brighten?</p>
<h3>Passing Through Zhenjiang</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>Taking the train through the tunnel, this is the second time. The first time was on the Guangzhou-Kowloon train, the length of the tunnel is similar to that of Dougai Mountain. When the train rumbles towards the entrance of the tunnel, you stretch your head forward to look, the train becomes a gliding snake spitting out black gas,</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>in an agile posture, swiftly drilling into the entrance of the tunnel. At this time, the nerve endings will feel a strange sensation coming over, like suddenly falling from the bright world into a bottomless abyss, the body losing its support. If there are also children in the carriage, then you can still see their innocent and childish state of clapping and cheering. After a while, the light reappears, and you can't help but turn your head to look back, at this time the train has become a snake coming out of the cave.</p>
<p>When the train comes out of the Dougai Mountain tunnel, you will know that Zhenjiang has arrived. First, you see Jiaoshan, and then, the tower on Jinshan Mountain, which rises into the clouds, grabs your attention. At this time, if you are a person with a bit of a poetic temperament, and you know a little about the story of the White Snake and Xu Xian, you can't help but stir up infinite nostalgia, gazing far away at the tower in a daze. You will recall and imagine the mysterious White Snake and the Zen master Fahai's battle of magic and ability, a sad, magnificent, and beautiful scene.</p>
<p>When the train starts to move forward again amidst the sound of the whistle, you can only bid farewell to Jinshan from afar with a look containing infinite sympathy, regret, and mourning.</p>
<p>Human nature is, after all, not completely poisoned by cruel and ruthless etiquette. You think, the story of the White Snake can spread among people, be enjoyed by people, grab the sympathy of countless people, and move the tears of countless single men and women, isn't this a manifestation that human nature has not been completely poisoned by cruel etiquette?</p>
<p>This tragic and beautiful White Snake Legend contains how many women's tears. This is not a myth, nor a fictional novel, this is a bloody and vivid real tragedy of the struggle between love and etiquette. The Snake Maiden is not a snake, not a demon, she is a human being with blood, flesh, and soul, a supremely complete woman. That sanctimonious Zen master Fahai is a man-eating monster in human form.</p>
<p>However, the evil forces of etiquette are ultimately too great, and its gates are ultimately difficult to shake; all the efforts, struggles, and resistance of the White Snake Maiden have completely turned into bubbles, and the result is still a complete defeat. The suppression under the Leifeng Pagoda declared the death penalty of the love of the supreme woman! And this ancient tragedy, the inherent deficiency in human nature, is left with bloody traces as a story of sympathy, regret, and sadness for the world.</p>
<h3>Sister-in-Law Zheliu</h3>
<h3>A Person Shaped by Emotion</h3>
<p>— Zong Xin</p>
<p>Still feeling lost, but the whole body feels much lighter. A fugitive!</p>
<p>Walking to the edge of the Saigon coast, I suddenly felt that the surroundings were so vast that my body was a little shaky; it felt like I had just escaped from prison! Standing under the tall and huge French postal ship, looking up, my mind became even more cheerful and rushed forward, and I couldn't help but exhale a long breath. A little lingering fear trembled slightly towards that terrible shadow.</p>
<p>The white clouds in the sky are boundless for thousands of miles, and I seem to be about to lightly fly to the vast and longed-for distance! I mustered up the courage to board the French postal ship. Looking at the long and winding ninety-nine bends of the Saigon port, the green port water, the green grass on both sides, and the light posture of the tropical style, my heart throbbed in bursts.</p>
<p>But turning back to look at Saigon, my heart was a little trembling, mixed with a sad and sour taste. The tearful appearance of my brother flashed back in my mind:</p>
<p>"What else is there to say? What else is there to say? I have wasted half my life's efforts."</p>
<p>My brother worked hard to create me, but I have been imprisoned once or twice. How could my brother be willing to let his younger brother drift alone to the vast distance! However, the younger brother is absolutely not content with this dead,沉, life-and-death merchant life, but wants to risk pursuing so-called freedom! My brother will never understand, he is simply seeking death!</p>
<p>For the past few days, my brother has been unable to eat. Why must my younger brother leave! And my eyes, also withered, dared not look at my brother's body. Alas, humanity shaped by emotion! I can't stop trembling with sadness, and a fire-like heat surging, a unbearable battle, making it impossible for me to swallow food in my throat.</p>
<p>Leaning on the side of the ship, I thought about it until my eyes went dark, and waves of dark shadows flickered. Saigon seemed to be shrouded in tear-like beads of fog, as miserable and sad as an autumn night with a sad wind and bitter rain. The crying sound of my brother's sobbing was always trembling in my ears, that sorrowful appearance…</p>
<p>My eyes went deep into Saigon, an inexplicably vague gaze!</p>
<p>Suddenly, a person whom I knew well walked over from afar. I rubbed my confused eyes and my heart jumped. But until he walked up to me, I was still stunned. He didn't call me, but took a roll of banknotes from his pocket and said to me:</p>
<p>"Your uncle gave it to me, told me to bring it to you. Your uncle told you that after you get to Hong Kong, you should take a first-class cabin back to Shantou and be careful on the way." He glanced at me and seemed to be leaving.</p>
<p>I don't know why, but I completely fainted. My whole body was trembling, my arms were so sore that it was difficult to lift them, and my eyes were wide open and speechless. The sour tears in my eyes were gushing out. A sense of awareness was telling me: if my brother called me back again, how could I say no to going back? I left so resolutely, but my brother still loves me so much! My whole body seemed to be immersed in a gentle embrace, and emotion was soaking through my cold bones! At this time, my brother was the master of my iron-like will! Although I finally left, the great power of will saved me! But the magic of kinship overwhelmed me again after I left! It is a person shaped by emotion!</p>

<h3>Darryl F. Zanuck on Methods of Choosing Material</h3>
<p>— Goldfinch</p>
<p>The most important issue for a film is its material. The most crucial task for filmmakers is finding suitable material.</p>
<p>This may seem like a commonplace observation, but when this statement comes from the head of an American film production company, such as Darryl F. Zanuck, head of production at 20th Century Fox, it is noteworthy. According to Zanuck, human emotions such as joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are eternally constant. Therefore, whether in the era of Sophocles in ancient Greece or the time of Shakespeare, the driving forces in drama, such as terror and hope, retain their ability to evoke sadness or joy today, just as they did in ancient times. Thus, discovering new stories for the screen, fresh and moving stories, involves seeking a new subject matter and simply reconfiguring and arranging the emotional elements. This applies not only to the screen but also to the stage and novels.</p>
<p>In fact, the skills of arranging and constructing dramatic stories are mastered by all successful authors, but filmmakers must do more than simply rearrange and interweave a story. Here, a more important question arises: the issue of "time and taste." "A magazine editor," Zanuck says, "can start editing a magazine for December in mid-July. They can put a snow scene on the cover and fill it with winter reading material. That's simple and risk-free. But in film production, it's not that easy. What material can we choose that we anticipate will suit the audience's taste six months from now?"</p>
<p>"You can't possibly guide popular tastes. To try to lead people in this film business is a dream, because the public refuses to be led by anyone. But if you run after the public, that's extremely dangerous. In a trend, only the first film can succeed. The rest of the imitations are like dwarfs watching a play behind giants. But how to predict future trends, the trends of audience thought, is a most important and complex issue."</p>
<p>How to predict future trends, how to grab the first big wave, and ride it to shore? This isn't about leading public opinion but rather providing something that the public needs at a particular time when they need it. Success in filmmaking is like success in baseball. Two moving objects must meet at a specific point in space and time. On the baseball field, those two objects are the ball and the bat; but in the film industry, the two objects are the material and the public's taste. In either case, if you're too late, too early, too broad, or too weak, you'll miss the opportunity and fail.</p>
<p>"What do you base your predictions of public taste on?" someone asked Zanuck.</p>
<p>Zanuck said, "I use newspapers. I read newspapers from all over the country every day. Two years ago, while reading the newspaper, I felt that American audiences were gradually growing tired of gangsters. Before that, American audiences admired gangsters. They admired that kind of chivalrous behavior, helping the weak and subduing the strong. But they soon realized that the rampant lawlessness of gangsters was a great scourge to society. So I started constructing 'Public Enemy,' which for the first time fully exposed the cruelty and depravity of these gangsters. Sure enough, when this film came out, the public flocked to it. Similarly, 'The House of Rothschild' would have been impossible to make even a year earlier. But later, I felt that the American people had developed a great interest in the activities of bankers in international diplomacy, so I decided to make that film. As expected, after the film was made, it was warmly welcomed by the public."</p>
<p>Someone asked him, "Will future films be adaptations of Shakespeare's plays or stage operas brought to the screen?"</p>
<p>Zanuck replied: The level of the audience's taste is constantly increasing, so it is certainly possible to adapt Shakespearean works for film in the future. It's just a matter of time, as people generally enjoy profound dramas, immersing themselves in them, rather than just showing off their status. As for bringing opera to the screen, that's an even greater step forward, not only because of the convenience of set changes but also because the singers in opera only need to have clear and accurate voices, not necessarily ones that resonate throughout the heavens. This means that opera singers on the screen can be slimmer than opera singers in the opera house and don't all have to be enormous in girth.</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3>Review of "Mills of The Gods"</h3>
<p>—— Da Guangming</p>
<p>As a reflection of the American economic panic, "Mills of The Gods" is not without value from various perspectives. Naturally, we cannot ignore that this reflects Roosevelt's New Deal and actively supports Roosevelt's political views through film art. Precisely for this reason, the concerned cannot help but be exposed to the impact of the global economic panic on American industry. It uses charts to illustrate that the prosperity index of American industry reached its peak in 1929 during the relatively stable period after the war. However, after the start of the economic panic, it immediately plummeted rapidly, and even large factories on the verge of bankruptcy had to close their iron gates. As a result, workers' strikes and riots could no longer be suppressed, causing great pain. Therefore, after Roosevelt took office, the New Deal—a desperate measure among desperate measures—came into being.</p>
<p>However, the playwright does not refrain from distorting reality at all. For example, he emphasizes the decadent lives of the capitalists. The children and grandchildren of the old boss, Mary, are all lazy and pleasure-seeking, indifferent to their own industries. We do not deny the decadent lives of the capitalists, but this cannot be the main reason for the failure of their industries. Similarly, he has the factory owner's daughter and the worker's leader fall in love, and the unrealistic nature of this cannot hide its deceptive effect. Because of these distortions of reality, he later presents a deceptive conclusion: on the one hand, sympathizing with the workers' actions, when the factory director closes the factory to avoid further losses, the workers surround the factory, almost rioting. At the same time, he tries his best to protect the interests of the factory owners. For example, because the factory owner's daughter and the worker's leader had a one-night stand of kindness, the worker's leader tries to ease the labor unrest. When it can no longer be eased, the factory owner orders the police to shoot. Finally, he has the factory owner's son accidentally killed by police machine gun fire as a kind of punishment (although he would never let him die at the hands of the workers, but rather accidentally by his own force). And the old factory owner's wife, who has been running the factory for more than fifty years, takes out another four million gold to revive the factory. As a result, the workers are very grateful, and there is so-called labor-management compromise and capable cooperation. Regarding this point, its political deception is extremely obvious, but when we examine the results of the New Deal, it is not very successful. On the contrary, it makes the United States more and more restless. Thus, the didactic effect of this film is equivalent to wasted effort.</p>
<p>However, as mentioned above, this film expresses the didactic effect by dividing it up and expressing it separately. Whether it is the script, actors, or cinematography, they are all very capable and quick, especially the excellent director, Roy William Nell, who handles every scene very delicately and meticulously. Particularly exquisite is the scene where the factory owner's daughter goes to the worker's leader's house, when describing the love and desire between them, that kind of delicate psychological description is indeed beyond ordinary mediocre directors. In addition, when using indexes to express the decline in production, he uses sound effects and quickly organizes many facial close-ups. This superior technique is, in any case, an expression of film art. Because of things like this, we do not undervalue this film, although it inevitably has a certain degree of social deception.</p>

<h3>Prelude to "A Beautiful Heart"</h3>
<p>— Jin Wen</p>
<p>Since Japanese imperialism occupied our Northeast, several years have passed. At the time of the "January 28th" and "September 18th" incidents, people were once full of anti-imperialist enthusiasm. I remember that Chinese films also made several anti-imperialist films, but as of today, public sentiment seems to be declining day by day, and Japanese imperialism's policy of actively invading our country still exists. The recent special change in Chahar is a clear demonstration.</p>
<p>In order to arouse the anti-imperialist enthusiasm of the people, the Star Film Company produced an anti-imperialist film "A Beautiful Heart" with the Northeast Anti-Japanese Volunteer Army as the background. The film is directed by Xu Xinfu and stars Hu Die, Wang Zhengxin, Xu Xinyuan, Gu Meijun, and Gu Lanjun. The story depicts how a patriotic warrior escaped from the prison of Manchukuo and how he stubbornly resisted the Japanese army in the ice and snow. In this story, the protagonist, the leader of the Volunteer Army, Li Feng (Wang Zhengxin), how he defeated the Japanese army in a difficult environment and finally died on the battlefield. Interspersed with a romance, tragic and ardent, making people want to cry without tears and want to laugh without sound after watching it. Undoubtedly, this is a film that awakens the people's anti-imperialist enthusiasm. May readers come and see this heartbreaking picture. (But)</p>
<h3>"The Merry Widow" Makes a Comeback</h3>
<p>— Bei Lin</p>
<p>The biggest romantic musical extravaganza produced by MGM during 1934-35, "The Merry Widow," was originally a fragrant and romantic stage play. Recently, MGM spent a lot of money to bring it to the screen.</p>
<p>The story of this film describes the wealthiest widow in the Kingdom of Mechavi, Sune, who is very young, beautiful, romantic, and good at singing and dancing. When she gets together with Count Donilo, a charming young man who is also a skilled socialite and a member of the Imperial Guard, many fragrant and romantic things happen. In the story, such as Donilo climbing over the wall late at night to introduce himself to Sune, and the later scenes where the two turn against each other due to misunderstandings, are very moving. But the greatest scenes in it are probably the music and dance. There is a most beautiful song, "Merry Widow," which is said to be now sung by almost every young person at home and abroad.</p>
<p>The director is someone we all know, Liu Renqian. As for the leading actors, Hivrely and McDonald, they are even more familiar to us, so there is no need to introduce them.</p>
<p>"The Merry Widow" was shown for many days in a row at the "Nanjing" a few weeks ago, and now, due to the demands of the majority of the audience, it has been re-released at the "Lido" starting yesterday.</p>
<p>Film Novel</p>
<h3>Clive of India (6)</h3>
<p>— Mao De</p>
<p>Manning looked at the ragged soldiers marching off and sighed, "This is truly the work of madmen." Cand said, "It really is a madmen's team." Pemberton said, "And, if you ask me, the officer in charge is also a madman." Governor Pigot, who was standing beside him, seemed to disagree, saying, "Fortunately... there is such a madman."</p>
<p>The goddess of fortune favored this desperate venture. After a few months, this small army of ragamuffins, or madmen, had become a large army. It was unstoppable, and no one who stood in its way was spared. Finally, the siege of Delhi-Napore was also lifted. Clive had become a victorious general, the conqueror of South India, and everyone had to take notice when he returned in triumph.</p>
<p>Amid the bombardment of Fort St. David, a grand welcome party was being held at the Governor's office. Civil and military officials were all present, quietly awaiting the arrival of the honored guest. But everyone became doubtful; where had the honored guest gone? Edmund McGreene reported, "When we returned, he left the main group, taking only ten guards, to go to a nearby place to tear down a French war memorial. He said that would let the Indians know the military power of the British." General Townsend, upon hearing this, said quickly, "That's right, that's right, that makes a lot of sense. But... will he come to the welcome party here..." Edmund said quickly, "He said he would come. He wouldn't not come. But, I want to ask for a leave to pick up my sister. She just arrived here from England today." The general quickly agreed, "Go quickly, go quickly."</p>
<p>Margaret was talking to Captain Clarke. Clarke was happily recounting many battlefield stories. One day, Clive was wounded in the head, but he disarmed a French unit all by himself. "He shouted at them to throw down their weapons. He told them they were trapped in the core. It was so dark that they couldn't see anything around them. So they were so panicked that everyone threw their weapons on the ground. By the time we found out and went to help him, he had already lined up a group of prisoners and marched them off. We all laughed so hard we almost died!" He said, laughing wildly.</p>
<p>Edmund walked up and said, "Ready? Let's go." Margaret suddenly became afraid and said, "Has... has... he come?" Edmund said, "No. He just has to go directly to the welcome party by himself. What would he look like after galloping forty miles? I wanted to have him meet you here and go with you." Margaret suddenly cried and said, "I... I... don't want to see that person!" Edmund said strangely, "What's wrong? Everyone in India wants to see Robert Clive today!"</p>
<p>Margaret pleaded, "Don't you understand what I mean? I came to this place... just wanting to meet an ordinary clerk... a friend of yours. Now he is a big man. He must think that I want to marry him." As she spoke, she sobbed and cried. Edmund laughed, "Margaret, it's too late to back out now! If Robert wants to see you, he must see you. If he wants you to marry him, he will tell you. You haven't even met him yet!"</p>
<p>Margaret said, "I want him to know that I have no hope at all." As she was speaking, there was already a commotion outside. Needless to say, Clive had arrived. Margaret's face turned red with anxiety. Her heart was pounding wildly, as if it wanted to jump out of her chest. She begged Edmund, "Tell him that I've already left!" But Edmund didn't look back and ran out to greet Clive. (To be continued)</p>
