<p>— 恒</p>
<p>據美電云紐約時報館主沃克斯巳於八日逝世享　七十有七我人忝爲同業於此報業先進之殂落能不一表哀悼之忱且沃氏以　人子憑其堅苦卓絕之意志自强不息之精神努力不懈成茲偉業亦大足爲我國靑年樹一絕好之楷模故我人於沃氏之成功尤不能不致其景仰</p>
<p>沃氏自幼僅受小學敎育初入報界僅爲送信童子其後改充排字工人至年十九始爲某地方報之助理編輯年二十於却諾登城中辦一行名簿頗獲嬴餘其後遂以收買却城時報是爲沃氏經營報業之始至三十八歲更收買紐約時報其時該報銷路僅二萬餘份雇員僅一百餘人所入不敷所出蓋一累年虧本之報紙也惟自歸沃氏經營後營業日形進展地位亦日見崇髙及至最近紐約時報之名聞於世界而　譽之隆則與英之太晤士報相伯仲至其銷數則平日達四十萬份星期則達七十萬份雇員增至三千人以上每年收入增至一千五百萬美金之多在他人經營而失敗者一入沃氏之手卽蒸蒸日上苟非有過人之才智曷克臻此</p>
<p>雖然紐約時報之所以成爲世界之大報者殊不在其銷數之多蓋紐約時報之銷數平日不過四十萬份星期亦僅七十萬份在歐美先進國家此一數目不可謂多如美之每日新聞The　Daily　News銷數達百萬份卽芝加哥講壇報Chicago　Tribune亦在八十萬份以上英之每日捷報The　DailyHerald數在二百萬份以上人民報The　People則在三百萬以上皆較紐約時報超過甚遠然世之言報紙者於英則推太晤士報於美則每推紐約時報抑又何耶良由報質之不同耳彼純以銷路爲自的者每多注意於普遍之興趣以迎合一般讀者之嗜好而於新聞內容之充實時事問題之剖解種種知識之介紹柱往忽略故報紙之銷路雖多其於社會國家所盡之功能轉不如銷路較少而風格較高之報紙故大報之所以爲大報不必在其每日出版數量之多而在於品質與內容之充實謹嚴也於此一點英之太晤士報與美之紐約時報皆能當之而無愧</p>
<p>我人一觀紐約時報之內容卽知沃氏辦報之成功要非偶然以我人所見紐約時報之特色其可得而言者約有下列數端（一）爲無綫電傳訊之採用有此設備之後對於國內外任何消息之採訪皆能敏捷過人而不受牽制（二）紐約時報之通訊員不僅滿布國內抑且遍布世界故無論何處有何新聞發生皆能由通訊員藉無綫電之媒介儘最拍發了無遺漏（三）紐約時報所聘國內外之通訊員皆爲對於某一問題研究有素之專家故其所發電訊不僅報道消息而己每能將此問題爲有統系之叙述名爲電訊實不啻一窮原竟委之論文（四）輓近政治社會經濟上之種種問題普通報紙讀者每難盡曉紐約時報則特爲延聘專家以極淺顯之文字爲之詳加剖析務使讀者一目了然（五）國際新聞讀者往往不甚注意殆爲各國人士之通病此其故實由於對國外事情之隔膜更由隔膜而缺乏閱覽國際新聞之興趣沃氏深知其故因於星期增刋中特請專家著爲專文對於每一國際問題詳加解釋此類文字每一星期必有一二十篇實爲了解世界大勢各國政情所不可或少之讀物倫敦太晤士報雖亦注重國際新聞然於此種解釋工作則未嘗措意此紐約時報所以獨占特色也</p>
<p>我人因此深覺沃氏之成功絕非倖致而實由其才識過人眼光卓越所得之結果以彼早年遭遇之困苦所受敎育之淺薄乃能憑其自身之努力發揮天賦之潛能以成此偉業能不令人嚮往耶</p>

<p>昨日上下午集議　惟聞午餐前之時間、全由英代表陳述西門聘問柏林及艾登聘問莫斯科華沙柏拉格之結果、</p>
<p>晨間會議於午後一時三十分暫止、由意政府在宮中開宴欵待諸賓、都四十人、嗣諸代表散步島上、並瞻禮歐戰中意軍總司令參加度那將軍之墓、午後會議於五時開始、討論法國向國聯申訴德國重整軍備事、</p>

<p>（三）對匈奧保三國軍備可能的讓步、</p>
<p>三總揆蒞止情形　斯特里薩　意相墨索里尼昨首先乘三引擎飛機由羅馬抵此、降落湖上、當夜十時三十分法總理佛蘭亭外長賴伐爾亦接踵而至、墨索里尼親迓於車站、站中有軍樂隊奏馬賽曲、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>斯特萊薩　英首相麥唐納及外相西門一行、於今晨八時四十五分抵此、爲三國代表之最後蒞止者、意相墨索里尼及外交次官蘇維志等迎之於站、當英代表團所乘之火車駛入車站時、意國軍樂隊卽奏「上帝佑皇」之英國國歌、意國駐英大使葛蘭悌亦與英代表同車抵此、英代表團旋驅車至旅邸稍憇、未幾卽乘汽船渡湖登貝拉島、三國會議遂於十一時開幕、會議前途固尙未易預測、惟將集中於法俄協定當無疑義也、（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>軍警武裝嚴戒備　意當局曾作極嚴密之戒備、以保諸代表之安全、諸代表所經過之邊界與鐵路大道均駐有軍警、嚴加防衛、且在數處安置機關槍、法總理佛蘭亭今晨偶在其旅館外散步、忽見有便衣者二十人尾隨其後、乃卽回館（十一日路透電）斯特里薩墨索里尼將居斯特里薩附近之伊歐拉貝拉小島上、該處有宮室一座、將作爲墨氏行轅、現該島四週已由泛繫軍隊嚴密守衛、登岸離岸俱須有特別通行證、現斯特里薩一小島、世界各國新聞記者羣集、謠言甚熾、但斯特里薩會議恐亦不過國聯行政院於十五日舉行會議前之一種籌備會、將决定召集擴大會議、邀請德國蘇俄及小協約諸國共同參加云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>英相出國前宣言　（倫敦）本日午後首相麥唐納偕外長西門乘飛機出發、前往斯特里薩、登機前首相發表宣言、謂「促進國際間誠意合作、以冀達到聯合安全與樹立和平之目的、此吾人所負任務也、余誠心希望此項任務克底於成、吾人當努力促其成功」云云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>法夾袋中一公約　斯特里薩　會議中將有何建議、今尙無確訊、但衆信法柏林安格里夫報討論法俄間之新恊定、謂法國之赴斯特里薩、衣囊中置一公約、復挾有與小協約國士耳其希臘間之軍事協定若干份、希望誘引遲疑之英國加入公約制度云、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>美考慮嚴守中立　（華盛頓）英法意三國政治家正集於斯特萊薩、謀解决歐洲之危局、羅斯福總統今日則在此與赫爾外長恊議美國嚴守中立之道、聞羅斯福總統頗贊同參議員奈氏昨在參院提出之議案、卽禁止美國金錢借與交戰國、及禁發美國人民至戰區之護照云、（十日國民電）</p>
<h3>義意大利唯一計劃　武裝保障和平　不欲制定抗德營壘　民報一文顯出意相手筆</h3>
<p>斯特里薩　今日意大利民報載有一文、顯出墨索里尼之手筆、略謂意國因歐洲天涯陰霾密佈、故仍須維持陸軍六十萬人、備有最新式之武器、俾聯合空軍與海軍保障和平、文中又述及最近之將來有舉行另一國際會議之可能、而包括未出席斯特里薩會議之德俄彼蘭三國、該文已引起外交界之甚大注意、蓋意中含有意國將再謀與德合作、而不欲在斯特里薩會議中制定抗德之營壘也、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>米蘭　意大利民報今日以「吾人之計劃」爲標題、大事登載一文、僉認此文係出於墨索里尼手筆無疑、此文當於斯特萊薩會議、警吿讀者不可樂觀、惟謂斯特萊薩會議亦不至爲戰爭之肇端、亦不克臻永久和平、蓋和平重心在會外之某一國也、斯特萊薩會議將討論關於不出席會議之德俄波三國之許多根本問題、東歐方面各事在變動狀態中、故所謂意大利計劃者大致如下、意國將保持大軍六十萬人、配置最新式之軍器、並將充實空軍海軍、以待時局之澄淸云、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>柏林釋明態度　願依據平等參加合作</h3>
<p>斯特里薩　柏林路透訪電稱、政界現正努力釋明德國現對歐洲綏靖問題之態度、較諸英國聘問柏林後所表示者更爲積極、並謂國聯今必須作許多變更、而後始能代歐洲傾向公約之熱情而爲有力的機關、德國願見歐洲綏請問題有一勞永逸之解决、如和平新精神及依據平等之合作者任何希望降臨日內瓦、則四月十五日舉行之國聯行政院會議應於此點有所隱示、國聯今後獲一機會、希望其承認而利用之云、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）德國政界人士對於斯特里薩會議、認爲未必能有成效、謂惟德國派代表參加之會議、方能產生結果云、又英國西門外相在下院發表宣言、力稱英國意見與德國不同、對於法意兩國所計畫之安全制度、則表示中立或欣悅之態度、德國政界人士聞之頗多不懌、政界人士現所焦慮者、計有兩事、一爲法俄協定、一則英意兩國對於法國申請國聯行政院一事之熊度是也、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（柏林）斯特里薩會議開幕、全歐目光均集於該會、該會結果立成爲德國各報揣測之主題、且有數報對於英外相西門在下院之宣言頗爲贊許、因由西門之言卽可推及斯特里薩會議中英國仍將本其數星期以來之探討政策從事、良以英國重使歷訪各京後、已得悉何項條約較有成功之望也、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>法俄協定　英具良好印象　使臨時變更預定計劃　謀擴大成為普遍公約</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今日得悉、法國與蘇俄行將成立軍事同盟一事、已使英國政府臨時變更其參加斯特萊薩會議之計劃、內閣於麥唐納首相及西門外相動身前、召集非常會議、决定此項變更、據稱、英國自聞法俄同盟消息後、决定設法使法國擴大其對俄協定、而成爲普遍之歐洲保安公或在法俄協定之外、另締其他公約、俾使德國麥加、外相西門於閣議前曾與美國駐英大使賓漢作長時間之晤談、西門屢述局勢、以備羅期福總統之參考、西門稱、英國不欲在斯特萊薩會議中另作新表示、此項會議純屬探討性質云、法國代表團乘火車至斯特萊薩、其中一人在途中發表聲明稱、英國之計劃或有獲得法國贊同之機會、如德國仍拒絕加入國聯、則法俄新計劃中載有雙方的互援公約、保護歐洲以抗德國云、該代表復明白表示、據法人意見、任何國家退出國聯實使其他忠忱之會員國有重新决定其立塲之必要、而對非會員過之威脅、尤應設法保衛云、法代表之言論可視為擬議中之法俄協定、志在成爲國聯結構內集合安全制度之一部、並非對付任何國家之軍事同盟云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>英外交界人士意見　（倫敦）英國方面對於法俄協定、具良好之印象、現在愈見徵實、今晚英國外交界對於此層、已有極明顯之表示、據外交界人士宣稱、法俄協定明白規定、以國聯會盟約爲根據、其立塲自屬堅固不拔、無論就理論或實際言之、均爲英國輿論所慶幸、不寗惟是、英國外交界更因此引起一問題、卽此種協定方式、是否可在斯特里薩會議提出討論、俾擴充以至歐洲全部是也、據外交界意見、用此種方式、在規定之地域內、對於國聯會盟約作確切之解釋、實最爲適當、蓋國聯會盟約如欲修改、則須經全體會員國之贊同、今用此法、旣不必修改盟約、其效果完全相同、而若干會員國亦不至提出異議、實爲兩全之策、外交界人士又提一問題、卽英國是否有依照法俄恊定大綱、參加此類公約之可能、此層現雖無從斷定、然預料美國倘决定參加此類公約、則英國各自治領當不至提出異議、蓋此類公約、其適用地域以歐洲爲限、性質與羅加諾條約相同、各自治領本可不受何種約束也、此外復有足注意者、西門外相昨在下院發表宣言、謂英國閣員未經國會同意、决不在斯特里薩會議接受何種約束云、外相雖有此種宣言、然斯特里薩會議中、英國代表仍不妨與法意代表成立某種原則上之協定、至於此（下接第七版）</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>種原則之眞體實現、則俟將來與國會方而共問討論後再行决定、亦無不可、此爲英國外交界人士所發表之意見、麥唐納與西門在斯特里薩會議究取何種態度、雖不當根據此種意見妄加推測、然此種意見之足以重視、則固可斷言也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>不啻公開軍事同盟　（巴黎）法國報界對於最近之法俄協定、至爲絨默、政府方面則竭力否認此次協定爲兩國軍事同盟之先聲、惟新聞報則一反其說、稱法俄恊定無疑的等於一公開之同盟、而此同盟之意義卽爲戰爭云、惟官方則堅稱協定之大槪不過爲解釋國聯盟約之普通原則、而所成立之條欵、亦不過一種大綱、其如何施行、尙須待諸將來之釐訂云、此項協定之第一條係序言、對於國聯盟約之第十第十六及十七等條均有確定之界說、而對於第十條之第二節、卽一侵略國家不願國聯盟約而逕啟兵端之應受軍事裁制之步驟、亦曾特別論及、恊定第二條規定爭執之無須立卽加以干涉者、第三條卽末條、則係依據國聯盟約第十六條第一節之規定、規定對付毫無顧忌之侵略者之行動、（十日國民電）</p>

<h3>英意觀點顯有不同</h3>
<p>斯特里薩　英國外相西門昨日在下院發表宣言、對於英國外交態度、雖有所透露、然未十分明顯、究竟英國代表團在斯特里薩會議將採取何種態度乎、意國人士對此層仍甚爲關切、英國方面人士咸謂首相麥唐納與外相西門來斯特里薩、並未携有何種計畫、英國方面以爲斯特里薩會議、除具有探訪消息之性質外、首先應决定者爲一主要之問題、卽是否尙可金圖與德國直接合作是也、英法意三國對於此一主要問題、倘獲得共同立塲、則其餘一切問題不難迎刃而解、惟意國方面之觀點則不然、意國以爲目前最緊要之問題、厥惟决定英法意三國之共同態度、此種共同態度並無反對德國之意、不過藉以應付德國單方面廢止凡爾賽條約軍事條欵之一舉已耳、凡關於歐洲方面之一切計畫、非俟此一緊要問題獲得一致後、不當加以考慮、由此可見英意兩國意見顯有不同、但英國方面則又以爲此種不同、僅屬方法上之歧異、至於根本觀點則並無差別、並謂英國代表團在麥唐納統率之下、現已决定以坦白剴切之精神、討論斯特里薩會議之一切問題云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意阿爭案亦將討論</h3>

<h3>波蘭觀測　會議決無成就　國際會議鮮有善果　對法俄協定取保留</h3>
<p>華沙　負責方面對於法俄恊定之提議、採取保留態度、咸謂蘇聯對於西歐局勢、不至發生過於密切之關聯、又此問各報對於斯特里薩會議鮮加注意、若干報紙加以諷刺、謂此係歐戰後第一百二十八次之國際會議、正與以前歷次會議相同、未必能獲得具體結果云、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>俄著名政論家　揭破德人野心</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）德國爲前德帝國軍隊首任軍需官魯登道夫大將慶祝七十壽慶、德帝國軍隊之野心、欲囊括自漢堡至巴格達德、自芬蘭須至阿德里亞海之世界、蘇聯著名政論家對之評論云、「目下德國法西政府當其昭吿舉世、改造軍隊實施普遍軍役之際、恒以魯登道夫爲旗幟、此點又能瞪明法西德國之政策、僅爲由大戰摧毀之德國帝國主義政策之繼續、如有人焉、猶不識不知、繼續討論德國法西主義之目的、則舉世固無一人昧於前此德國帝國主義所抱之目的」云、（十日塔斯社電）</p>
<h3>日本隔岸觀火　東報促政府充分準備　防歐洲風潮延及東亞</h3>

<h3>英法國防　仍以戰艦為中堅　天空轟擊未能使之失效希臘亂事中所得之經騐</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英海軍大臣孟塞爾今日在海軍建築家學會演說、謂希臘新近之叛變、與美國大規模之試驗、業已表示天空轟擊並未使戰艦失效、希臘舊巡艦阿維羅夫號之經騐、可以借鑑、該艦並無艙面保護、僅置有舊式三時口徑高射砲兩尊、然能自由出入、隨意而行、不爲新式飛機追擊所困也、舊式戰艦猶可抵禦天空襲擊、則將來戰艦定可爲國防中之砲壘、渠信戰艦將始終爲帝國安全之樞鈕、海軍中人皆抱此意見云、據每日電聞海軍記者稱、法國海軍當局近已决定將來法國艦隊以戰艦爲中堅、而與從前徧重潛艇與輕艦之主張相反云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>美再提高銀價　國內新出礦白銀　每盎斯七角一分</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）羅斯福總統頃决定國內新產白銀收買之價、應自每盎斯六角四分半加至七角一分、並於本日起實行、惟銀幣鑄造稅則、由五角减至四角五分、一般人以爲國內銀價提高、大部份原因係由於倫敦市塲投機活動所致、銀價提高之後、美國政府因實行購銀法、所需經費將增加一萬萬元有奇、按目前國外銀價、係在六角四分三七至六角四分半之間、財長摩根曹　謂國外銀價若漲至六角四分半、或六角四分半以上、政府卽當提高內國銀價、此項宣言發表之後、加拿大蒙脫里阿城交易所銀價、卽漲至六角五分一至六角五分半、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）財長摩甘索與羅總統晤商後聲稱、美國將應付世界商塲中所有之任何銀價、目前世界銀價每盎斯在四角六分半左右、如價漲起、則美國亦將提髙銀價云、今晨羅總統與新聞記者晤談時、對於白銀新立法案之主張、不置批評、但謂如世界銀價超過六角四分半、則美國之經營銀礦者當可得更高價格、參議員湯姆士聲稱、麼廿索之宣佈與白銀收買案之條文相符合、蓋此案規定財部須應付世界銀價也、財長此語、可鼓勵白銀之用途、依此途徑進行、當有進步可期、財部方面之不同情於白銀程序者、聽令銀價低落、但白銀派議員始終堅持其提高銀價之要求云、財長發言後、聞紐約大條售價爲六角四分七五、此說初未證實、但據後來消息、銀價確已漲起、有以六角五分價格成交者、最後價格爲六角四分六二五、聞成交數在三十萬與五十萬盎斯之間、金融界皆極注意白銀、國會銀派委員對於摩甘索之宣佈、甚爲滿意、國內出產白銀老因世界銀價已高、將不願照現有之法定價格將其礦銀售與財部、今日午後羅總統乃將財部收買國內礦銀之價格由每盎斯六角四分半增至七角一分、從今日起實施、於是美國新出礦之銀價驟漲六分半、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）估計財部所須付之銀價、旣已增髙、則國家須多付一萬萬元强之經費、以期履行白銀收買案之條文、據財部人員稱、此案終將使政府收買價値九萬五千零九十六萬七千元之白銀、財部收買礦銀每盎斯七角一分之價格、其所以成立者、因鑄幣稅由五角减至四角五分也、依現有八、五九九、七四三、〇〇〇元之黃金供給之根據而計算、白銀收買案下所須收買之白銀、則國庫應有價値二、八六六、五八〇、〇〇〇元之存銀、方符合黃金七五與白銀二五之比率、査財部現有之存銀、僅値九一五、六一四、〇〇〇元、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）此間官塲認羅總統今日將購銀價格由六角四分五增至七角一分之决定、已表示美政府較前更積極進行白銀政策之决心、一般輿情以爲此舉表明政府將繼績進行其囤積大批銀凖備之政策、白銀派所主張一盎斯白銀須値一元二角九分之價格、今乃愈進一步、據許多專家之意見、美國提髙銀價之立卽影響、將爲世界銀價之繼長增髙、若干觀察者認當局此舉至少半由於國會白銀派之壓力、蓋彼等提高銀價之運動已有多時也、（十。路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國白銀政策現又爲一般視綫集中之點、據銀市經紀人之意見、世界銀價之追隨美國國內髙價、僅爲時日問題、迨世界銀價隨之髙起、則美當局又將提髙國內價格、直至將來白銀派所抱白銀每盎斯售價一元二角九分或金銀十六對一比價之夢想實現時而後止、美國購銀政策、尙待有若干進行、此爲白銀看髙之要點、銀市經紀人及銀行家指美國之行爲、將使中國貨幣困難、愈形尖銳化、蓋以中國白銀之輸出將更多也、彙聞報今日謂銀價續漲之責任、由美國負之、美國領袖似决計欲摧毀中國貨幣標準、如美國今後仍不顧一切、向其目的進行、則惟有勸中國趕速另立貨幣新標準耳、金融界中人早已料及羅總統增高國內銀價之决議、蓋以世界銀價旣已漲起、渠顯然未可在外出價高於國內也、英鎊旣跌、中國白銀輸出亦减、而美國在購銀案下所需之白銀、又復大增、故銀價之高漲、似不可免、世界金融未必受其影響、就中國而言、其惟一解决方法、在脫離自銀而與他種通貨相連結、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>法國鼓鑄金幣</h3>

<p>吳市長為積極推進本市各種社會事業起見、昨特邀請本市各界領袖、暨「衛生事務所」·「公共大禮堂」·「火葬場」·等委員會委員、籌同進行辦法、到五十餘人席間市長有長篇報告、辭甚肯切、茲探錄其原稿如下、</p>
<p>緒言　各位先生、今天請各位先生來此午餐、就是想請各位先生來共同商討關於閘北大禮堂、南市大禮堂、浦東衛生事務所、閘北衛生事務所、火葬場、等幾件社會建設事業的進行、市政府現定今年為社會建設年、關於社會建設事業、應舉辦者甚多、但是我們因經濟等種種關係、不能一時樣樣完成、所以祇能視地方政府與社會的財力情形、以及社會需要的緩急先後、逐漸舉辦、</p>
<p>平民福利事業　最近我們决定要舉辦的事業、一是建築三千間平民住所、一是改良與救濟人力車夫、這兩件事、現已籌有的欵、並已組織平民福利委員會、着手進行、該平民福利委員會的委員、都為本市中外知名之士、</p>
<p>識字運動　其次、我們今年還要舉辦識字教育、擬自七月一日起、至明年六月底止、在這一年內、將市區內不識字的人、施以強迫的識字教育、使人人都識字、據以前的估計、在本市區內、兩租界除外、不識字的人、約有五十萬之多、所以我們想以一年的時間、來解次上海市的文盲問題、此事現亦已組織委員會、開始進行、這幾件事、我們熱切地希望地方上各界人士、盡力的來帮助我們、以促其成、</p>
<p>學校建設　其次、關於學校建設事業、上每市內的學校很多、但是有很多學校的校舍、已破舊不堪、或設備太不完備、因此找們又想在今年內、將幾個市立的校舍、籌欵改建、不但校舍須設立改良、即在設備方面、也將力求完備、此事現在已另外組有委員會、正在積極進行之中、</p>
<p>衛生事務所　今天召集各位先生到這裏來、開首已說過、是為共同商討關於閘北大禮堂、南市大禮堂、浦東衛生事務所、閘北衛生事務所、火葬場等幾件社會事業的進行、衛生事務所的建設、已為本市很迫急的需要、現在上海市立的衛生事務所、高橋有一個、吳淞有一個、江灣有一個、南市有一個、道幾處衛生事務所成立後、使各該地方的人民、得到了不少的便利、這是眾目共睹的事實、好像高橋衛生事務所、沒有成立以前高橋地方的嬰兒、死亡率為百分之四十、自高橋衛生事務所成立後、竟减至百分之三或四、換言之、亦高橋衛生事務所沒有成立以前、高橋的嬰兒一百個之中、死四十個、自高橋衛生事務所成立後、在一百個嬰兒之中、祇死三個或四個而已、很明顯的、因為衛生事務所之設立、嬰兒死亡率、已呈銳减的現象、又好像江灣一帶的人民、和江灣附近林立的學校的學生等。因江灣衛生事務所的成立、也得到了極多的便利、如學生的騐眼騐牙等等、每日人數很多、再譬如南市衛生事務所、在從前每天到那裏去、求醫取藥的約有六百人、現在差不都已增至一千人、以此就可以證明衛生事務所需要的迫切、現在南市閘北、雖都已有醫院、但是醫院和衛生事務所的性質和功用、各有不同、而現在浦東與閘北兩處的衛生事務所、尚付闕如、所以我們想趕緊在浦東和閘北兩處、各設衛生事務所一所、來施醫施藥以便利當地人民、並管理公共衛生事務、這是我們要建築浦東和閘北兩衛生事務所的緣由</p>
<p>公共大禮堂　其次、關於閘北大禮堂和南市大禮堂的建築、建築大禮堂的需要、我們覺得也很迫切、南市現在人口有六十一萬七千五百七十三人、閘北現在的人口有六十九萬七千一百九十四人、南市差不多六十二萬人、閘北差不多七十萬人、這兩處的人民、既如此眾多、關於這兩處人民的婚喪喜慶的事情、當然不在少數、故建築大禮堂的需要、也當然很迫切、現在該兩處人民、因為缺乏禮堂的緣故、遇有婚喪喜慶之事、不能不假旅館酒館廟堂等來舉行、因此禮節方面、弄得很不莊嚴、同時無謂的靡費也太大、所以我們要在南市建築一座大禮堂、在閘北也建築一座大禮堂、以供南市和閘北市民、舉辦婚喪喜慶等事之用、而且公共大禮堂、還有三種好處、第一是簡單、我們所想建築的大禮堂內、關於婚喪喜慶等事的種種設備、無不力求完全妥善、如有人有婚喪喜慶等事、要到大禮堂裏來舉行、裏面一切設備都有、辦事的手續可以簡單不少、第二是經濟、如有婚喪喜慶等事、到大禮堂來舉行、所有一切衣帽鞋襪等服裝以及其他事件、都必須依照大禮堂所定的最儉省的規則辦理、以符經濟的原則、第三是莊嚴、如果祇是簡單經濟、社會上一般有錢的人、恐怕就不會來、因為他們有錢人、以為太簡單經濟不好、他們要的是熱鬧、我們所要建築的大禮堂、是很莊嚴的、莊嚴不是金錢所能買得到的、我們大禮堂裏的一切設備與禮節、都是經過周密的研究而規定的、與世俗的舖張揚厲、絕然不同、此外大禮堂的功　、不但可作社交的中心、同時我們還可以假他為一切民眾集會與訓練之處、所以也可以成為民眾教育的中心、建築大禮堂、既有這許多的益處、我們為要改良風俗、轉移風氣、提倡節約、以及普及民眾教育起見、不能不有這種大禮堂的建築、我們計劃中的大禮堂之建築、規模很大、想在內中設一較大的禮堂、約可容五百人、在旁邊再建幾個較小的禮堂、約可容一二百人、使同時可有幾家人家舉行、此外在兩旁再設立酒菜茶館禮服店等等、什麽東西、都應有盡有、而一切價格、都定得非常低廉、務使便利經濟、雙方兼顧、</p>
<p>火葬場　還有關於籌建火葬場的事、我們想建築兩個火葬場、一在浦東、一在浦西、我們為上海的市容、土地公共衛生等關係、亟有建築公墓、提倡火葬的必要、所以我們想先設立二個火葬場、因為我們在市一區內、無論什麽地方、無不看見有許多墳墓、甚至有許多棺材、曝露在田野間、這非但有碍我們的市容、交通道路、以及公共衛生、就是我們活着的人見了、心裏實在也有所不安、所以籌建火葬場之舉、也應為吾人所注意、</p>
<p>期在必行　上面這幾件事、都是我們在今年社會建設年內所要舉辦的事業衛生事務所、我們定四五兩月為籌備時期、六月為建築時期、大禮堂定四五六月為籌＋備時期、七月為建築時期、火葬場也擬於本年內興建、市府對於這幾件事、已勢在必行、故雖在財政十分困難的今日、亦决極力籌欵來辦理、市政府已擬撥一筆欵子、但是還不够、故還要請地方人士、盡力予以贊助、以速其成、</p>
<p>希望市民合作　我想市政是最足以表現自治精神的、雖然現在還沒有完全達到自治時期、但是祇要人民能為地方出力、就可以表現自冶的精神、所以市政府同人、此後所有關於一切社會新事業的建設、不僅在籌備的時候、要請地方領袖人士來參加籌備、就是在建設告成以後、在管理方面、也還是想請地方人士來參加管理、如市政府去年興建的運動場、體育館·游泳池·圖書館·博物館·市立醫院·市立衛生事務所等、都莫不如此、因為如此、一方面可以表現政府與人民的合作、一方面也是以促進地方自治的實現、所以我們請各位先生，對於最近要建設的幾件社會事業、要竭力予以贊助、俾得早觀厥成、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （持佛）</p>
<p>常人之情，每遺忘其人待我之善·而記其人待我之惡。怨恨之念，橫亘胸中；恩德之心，澹若雲烟；此「以怨報德」者之所以多也。</p>
<p>人之待我，無論蕃惡，我皆以善意譬解之：則心平氣和，自無怨恨之色。</p>
<p>每見世人，遂其慾，則歡天喜地，戚激至於泣下。一旦稍拂其意，違其慾，則憤懣之氣，勃然以生；詆毁讒謗，不遺餘力。小人心理，大率類是。</p>
<p>與人談話，有己無人；自己話，說得滔滔汨汨；人家話，藐若無聞。甚至人言未盡，搶了亂說，社會上多此輩人，此「有我無人」之明證也。</p>
<p>言為心聲，毁我者可懼，譽我者亦可怕。不言者常為人忌，多言者常為人憎。言謙則小人氣高，言傲則君子腹非。言不慎，足以僨事，足以殺身；甚矣，言之難也！</p>
<h3>解放婦女的生活</h3>
<p>— 周賢</p>
<p>這是某小姐的某一天的生活的描述。</p>
<p>上午十一點鐘哈着呵欠起牀。侍候伊的阿金，一壁給伊預備洗操，一壁告訴伊楊先生候在會客室裏，請伊出去吃大菜。</p>
<p>伊點了一點頭，趿着高跟拖鞋，到浴室裏去洗過了操，匆匆地理髮，搽粉，塗口紅。忙亂了一陣子，披上了一件新製的春大衣，套上高跟鞋，急急的走下樓去，對楊先生嫣然一笑，便偎倚着楊先生，鑽進了楊先生的大屁股汽車。</p>
<p>從西餐館出來，已是一點半，楊先生把伊送到了俱樂部，自己去辦公。</p>
<p>伊在俱樂部裏，玩了八圈牌，天色已漸黑下來了，於是何先生便邀去吃晚飯</p>
<p>晚飯之後，又由何先生作東，邀着去瞧某大戲院的好萊塢新攝完成的一九三五年的愛情名片。</p>
<p>瞧過電影，便給何先生拉着上某跳舞塲去。</p>
<p>踏進了舞塲，一眼瞧見張先生，沈先生，余先生，徐先生，以及其他十幾位一時記不起姓名來的男朋友，三三兩兩的都在裏面。一見伊進來，誰都忙不迭的奔過來招呼。</p>
<p>樂聲響了，和伊相識的，都要求同伊舞一回。於是伊輪流着，同每一位相識的舞一次。</p>
<p>待到十二點鐘，伊覺得有些倦了，於是披上大衣，梟裊婷婷的跨出舞塲，雇了一輛出差車回腐。</p>
<p>又由侍候伊的阿金，侍候伊洗過了操，坐上寫字檯，開始用剪子把檯上十幾封男朋友的來信，一一剪開來。瞧了一遍，匆匆的提起自來墨水筆，一一回復了。有的，還附了一張照片去。</p>
<p>工作完畢，已是淸晨四點鐘。伊哈了一個呵欠，伸了一個懶腰，一壁倒上牀去，一壁咕噥着道，「勞什子的社交，累死我了」。</p>
<h3>談姓</h3>
<p>— 劉訓維</p>
<p>日前看到春秋上有一位椀君所投怪姓錄一稿，後又有公君續稿一篇，上面多係罕覯的姓氏，却引起人不少興趣。不過兩君之稿，還多有為百家姓所載，現在據我所知，係百家姓所沒有，而又是兩君所沒有談到的，却還有幾個，不妨提出談談。</p>
<p>（火）上海有位文學家呌火雪明。同時敝邑阜寗還有商店呌火廣阜，店主人呌火淸泉。（還）我們家鄉有個窶人呌還有能，他已經老去了！他的老妻尙在，我們都喊他呌老還。（曇）我有一史地敎員他曾說他在中大讀書時期，有個狠要好的朋友，姓曇花一現的曇字，名其采，為遼寗產。（裔）鹽城岡門狠多姓裔的，淸時有裔步鸞是吏部主事。我們鎭上有裔姓名繹，在淸為諸生。（薩）現在福建有位海軍上將呌薩鎮冰。我們知道元代還有個名詩人呌薩都刺。（環）我有一親戚從前在鎭江，曾認識過一個姓環名濟人。（保）姓保的在南通是一個著族，在科舉時代很出不少人物。（眭）我們族家開的一爿商店，有年來個收賑客呌眭伯明，是鎮江人。（諶）蘇州有一位聞人諶則高，勞動季報的編者呌諶小岑。（　）我有一位先後同學的女同學，呌茆古珍。（過）三友實業社的郵售部主任呌過慕潛。（邸）我最近認識一位同學陰君的表兄呌邸湘。（樓）前途雜誌有位特約撰選呌樓桐孫。（畝）第七期美術生活上有個畝東亭。（掌）我們家鄉很多姓掌的，有個掌牧民現任國防論壇撰選。（菱）本報常有一位投稿者，呌菱湖昭。（浦）當代有個作家呌浦薛鳳。他如狄靑元夜破崑崙的廣西叛逆儂智高的儂姓，都是不多見的姓氏吧！我國姓氏之多，歷來相傳，很多雖同姓而不宗，僅有孔夫子的後人和霸王項羽的後人，這兩姓却是不雜亂，所謂「天下無二孔」「天下無二項」，因此他們卻是天下一家了！但是確與不確，尙須待攷。</p>
<h3>戰士休息䖏</h3>
<h3>別字和抄襲</h3>
<p>— （鄭逸梅）</p>
<p>別字和抄襲，這是我輩酸溜溜的朋友，所引為奇恥大辱的。尤其是投稿，別字連篇的，當然沒有錄取的希望，那「抄襲家幸勿惠顧」，更很彰明的登在徵文條例內。即使編輯的一時被你瞞過，然總難逃讀者銳利的目光，吿發抄襲，揭載報端，直使受者無地自容，不敢再行嘗試。但是社會上却有兩種人，正在那兒提倡別字和抄襲。一種是醫家，醫家開列方劑，往往多用別字，即使儒醫，也照例的別字雜出，因此俗有藥別字之號，如枳殼寫作只壳，茈胡寫作柴胡，厚樸寫作厚朴，黃蘗寫作黃拍，諸如此類，舉不勝舉。那不是提倡別字嗎！一是畫家，不論山水人物花卉，總是寫上仿石谷，撫老蓮，臨壽平等字樣，即使生平從沒有瞧見過石谷老蓮壽平的作品，也不妨胡亂的寫着，用以表顯自己的畫是有來歷的。那不是提倡抄襲嗎！這種別字和抄襲，誰也不敢指責他，吿發他。神聖—別字，神聖！抄襲。</p>
<p>世界珍聞</p>
<h3>新意大利見聞</h3>
<p>— 菽</p>
<p>意大利在未革命之前，其腐敗程度，與中國一樣，說不定還要澈底些，但在數年之中，能盡洗積習，發奮為雄，現在巳成世界强國，其政集頗為我國所注意，於是中意兩國，日漸接近起來。過去我國上了聯俄口號的當，結果是造成無數共匪，目前比較對中國胃口的，法西斯主義當然也是一種，於是關於法西斯主義討論的書籍，便成為應時之品，有些翻譯西洋舊書，有的根據道聽塗說，一樣可以博得讀者的歡迎，但是意大利的政策，每日在奮進中，譯文所載，已是數年或十年的故事了。這裏所說，都為他書所不載，根據自己考察所得，故稍可近時。</p>
<p>意國雖地仄人擠，但並不提倡節育，而且鼓勵生產，兒女越多，越受政府越待，小孩生產時可向政府領獎金外，另由政府按月補助費用，同時對於小孩之父母，亦予以相當鼓勵，無論買物乘車，均可打折付欵，八口之家，即完全免費乘坐舟車，與我國社會之盛行節育與殘殺嬰孩者，適得其反，蓋人口為國家之資源，不鼓勵生產，而欲其國家之日趨富强，固人人知其不可能。</p>
<p>政府對任何國民，除薪金以外，另有津貼，按其職級之大小，以定多寡，猶之我國君主時代，凡有功名者均可食祿，故縱至失業，仍忠於政府，絕無反叛之事，其津貼最低數，為適足維持一家失業後之生計，故在意國任何公民失業，决不至投河自殺，以至走入迷途等慘事</p>
<p>男女平權之聲，在我國較任何文明國家為高，但實際矛盾百出，終未見其平允，意國凡男女擇偶，均由政府審查，倘男子在經濟地位，不甚富裕時，例須女子有充分之妝奩，方允結合，以補救收入不敷維持之缺憾，此在中國必行不通，但不失為男女平權最公允之例設，蓋女子可仰給於男子，則男女牧人微薄時，亦可借助於女子也。</p>
<p>高小初小不收學費，其他費用，亦至微渺，任何窮苦子弟，均得入學，其敎育自可發達，我國則不論私立學校，均收費奇昂，非中下家庭，所可負担此巨大之敎育費，以致兒童多數失學，人民知識淺薄，無怪其不知何為民族，何為國家也。</p>
<p>甚望當局今後能採用良好制度，以改革敎育，維持民生，尤須着重實際，母徒空耗金錢於門面建設也。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回　夜話凄凉生涯原是夢履痕零亂風雨太欺人</p>
<p>可是這滿院子浮泥，被這幾位忙人，踐踏得大小深淺到處都是鞋子印，那條磚石鋪的路，在許多鞋印中，也就無從分出，如何能走？先前看到那個女人，顚顚倒倒，走了出去，已經是可憐。然而他自己還是很高興的。現在朱月英跟隨在他們身後，緊緊的鎖了兩道眉毛，滿臉都含了難堪的樣子。雖然他是很注意的看着地上走。可是他每走一步，頓一頓，好像還有些不願走的樣子。因為他的精神，並不能貫注，脚在地上，也不着實。一陣大風來了，將他的傘，和他的衣服，統通的一捲，他的身子，就不能不隨着這風勢歪斜過去。身子向左，脚不免要向右去支立定了。不知道這脚底下的泥，正是容不得人使勁，脚的力量越足，那浮泥是越要滑動，再也不由月英作主。連人和傘，同時滾到泥漿裏去？志前看到，首先哎喲了一聲。胡嫂子同楊浣花還是這一聲哎喲驚動了的。立刻回轉頭來看時，月英將傘拋在一邊，側了身子在泥水裏躺着。胡嫂子是雙小脚，自身難保，就不能來扶人。楊浣花手上撐了一把傘呢，也騰不出手來，這倒只有對泥水裏這個姑娘望着了（一八〇）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>大概這截木跟的高度，總在三寸至五寸之間。同時還得注意，不能做得太粗笨，必須很輕巧。而在太后和其他一般貴婦人所穿的履上，那截木跟還得加意點綴一番；比較普通的點綴是用各種顏色的碎玻璃片團團地揷嵌着，中間少不得還要用些麻綫或紗綫之類繞緊起來，以免跌落。這樣一點綴，逢到有陽光照耀着的時候，便會閃閃生光；敎人看了，還當是踏着一截寳石鑿就的鞋跟咧！但這是不很容易見到的情形；因為這截鞋跟旣是永遠在人的足下踏着，又沒有多少高，那裏會時常給陽光照射到呢？鞋跟的底下是裹着一層層的棉布，用很細的小釘釘着，或用很堅韌的皮綫縫起來；這樣一襯，走路的時候，便不致再閣閣地發出惱人的聲音來了。這個法子眞和現在一般人所穿的皮鞋上有一塊像皮跟釘着，意義相同，祇是用起來比較不耐久一些。</p>
<p>除掉鞋跟之外，就得注意鞋子的本身了！鞋子的本身又分鞋底和鞋面兩部份；鞋底的製造是很簡單的，正和中土婦女穿的布底鞋一樣，或削一片絕薄的木板，用一層層的布裹起來，以代尋常的布底，這是可以無庸細述的。那鞋面的工程，却就非同小可了！它們的式樣，細算起來，竟有幾百種之多，最普通的是飛鳳式，和梅花形；其餘種種比較特別的式樣，我現在竟舉不盡許多。（二九一）</p>

<p>哲學的範圍　我們要研究哲學、不能不先考一考竹學的範圍、哲學是宗敎上分出來的、宗敎鼓盛的時候、把自然現象及人類行為、都加以武斷的說明、只許信仰、不許懷疑、後來有懷疑的出來、以對於宗敎半脫離或全脫離的態度、試為不必盡同於宗敎的說明、這是哲學的開始、哲學的開始時候、把解釋自然現象與人類行為的責任、統統擔負起來、如希臘的雅里士多得、英國的培根、都是為此、這是哲學範圍最廣的時候、後來解說自然現象的科學漸漸成立了、如物理·化學·地質·天文，動物·植物等等、於是哲學的範圍縮小一部分了、後來解釋人類行為的科學、為歷史·社會·語言·政治·法律等等、也漸漸成立了、於是哲學範圍又縮小一部分了、最後心理學以應用實騐方法而成為獨立的科學、敎育學·美學跟着來、也有成為實騐科學的趨勢、倫理學可試用歸納法、於是哲學的範圍乃更小了、</p>
<p>哲學與科學　哲學的範圍、雖因科學的成立、而漸次縮小、然哲學與科學的關係、乃日益密切、蓋科學建設的初期、雖局於微小的測騐與比較、而發展以後、積理日多、欲搆成一貫的理論、就往往涉及哲學領域、是以有一科的哲學、如數理哲學·法律哲學、有綜合自然科學的哲學、如自然哲學是、有綜合自然科學與社會科學而構成系統的、如斯寶塞爾的粽合哲學、孔德的實騐哲學是、至於純粹的玄學家、似乎超科學的、然而以直觀建設玄學的柏格遜、雖歷言偏重理知的流弊、而他所引用的例證、還是取資於科學、這可見哲學與科學的密接了、</p>
<p>硏究的方法　至於研究哲學的開始、照葉靑先生說的、先讀哲學概論與哲學史是最好的、讀了這類書以後、於哲學大概與從前哲學家的派別、都知道一點了、若覺得有一派特別可　的、就可搜羅這一派的書詳細閱讀、若覺得沒有一派滿意的、可再取詳細一點的哲學史再看、或者可以引起興趣、至於研究的範圍、亦不必太拘泥、若本來有一種科學的特長的、就可從此入手、如達爾文從生物學進行、羅素從數學進行是、若對於各科學、本沒有特別嗜好、而就從哲學上進行、也可分博約兩種、博的是各方面都顧到的、如翁特著有論理學·倫理學·心理學·及其他民族心理·哲學入門等書、柯亭著有純粹認知的名學·純粹意志的倫理學·純粹感情的美學等、約的是偏於一方面、如洛克的偏於認識論、克洛綏的偏於美學等、總之、研究的對象、全可自由决定、並不受何等拘束的云云、</p>
<h3>盟祿博士談　中國文化復興　在政治上文化上尙未尋着自己　—世界高等敎育應加變通注重實用</h3>
<p>字林報云、美國敎育家孟祿博士、係中華敎育文化基金董事會副董事長、比因該會將於本月十九日在滬舉行年會、討論美國所退還庚子賠欵第二批半數之用途支配事宜、已於日前乘加后號郵船抵滬、博士昨日（十日）曾與客討論彼所稱為吾人新時代中「最有意義之運動」、即東方文化之出現與復興、而自身能在其受胚胎之諸國表示其眞實是、據謂渠信中國在政治上與文化上尙未尋着自己、中國一旦在政治上與文化上尋着自己時、在西方之吾人、殊願予以對日俄兩國之同樣注意、日俄今皆為人尊為世界强國矣、博士又謂中美兩國在敎育界中往日密切之關係、今不幸已漸見疏離、今日中國留美學生之人數、視前减少、而美國供外國學生（內有中國學生若干）所用之欵、亦經削减美人對中國敎育機關之注意、雖與前無異、而所予之財政助力、亦見减少、其一部分之原因、或由美國一般情感以為一國當經營自己之文化生活、而不受他　之干涉、致響應呼籲捐資於中國敎育事業者、遂不若前之踴躍、然其較大之因素、必由於經濟衰落無疑、事雖如此、但美人注意於東方、尤其為中國、已較往日更見普遍、美國學校已從事增多有關東方文化之科目、且有學者至中日專　研究者、以求將來在美國學校中担任專職、美國傳學協會聯合會為提倡此項運動者之一、該會對成此種科目之發展、尤特別關心、以期將來以遠東一門列入課程、而往日課程則僅與希伯來桑斯克里特及近東問題有關也、在東方目前渴　效法西方中、絕未發見任何謬誤、但觀今日中國之情狀、寗謂為中國文化復興之又一表微、此種景象、僅為揉合新時代政治經濟的理想與方法而成者、東方自始即相信其自己文化之眞實、但此文化必須加以修改、而使適用於新時代之世界、東方文化之復興、此為根本的事實、在印度阿刺伯土耳其俄羅斯日本波斯中國、已有確鑿不能爭辨之明證、此由西方新時代的旅行方法、日見便利、有以促進之、而其結果使人在東方隨處可見其文化發展之一律增速云、按博士著有敎科書與歷史課本等多種、客問以對於中國翻印西方書籍問題、意見若何、博士答曰、若能承認著作家之權利、此亦為一公道事、但吾人在實際上亦無許多邏輯上之理由可與爭辯、美國亦嘗翻印英國書籍、至十九世紀來始已、總之、此為一種複雜問題云、</p>
<p>又上海泰晤士報云、孟祿博士日者語客、謂今為補救世界高等學校與大學學生產量過多起見、急當變更敎育方法、俾更注重實際的訓練、畢業高等學校與大學之男女靑年、其前途殊形黯澹、全世界受訓練之人物今皆有產量過多、而用途太少之感、此所以僅德國一國、已有曾得哲學博士學位之畢業生十三萬人、無事可為、此種情况、今習見於全世界、今為矯正此不規則之狀况計、應將高等學校之學生、减少名額、所敎授之科目、應加變通、博士之意、與個人有利的職業、不特有益於本人、且可有助於社會、博十深信今日中高大學之問題、厥為選擇資質良好之學生、俾社會値得以發展其才之必要金錢、用於其身、天資非學校所能創造、學校唯能就其天資加以訓練耳、按博士曾蒞華多次、星期四日已乘飛機前往北平、會唔中華敎育文化基金會其他董事、返滬後、定十八日在禮查飯店向聯太平洋會會員演說、題為「美國政治與經濟之衝突」、十九日至二十一日參與中華基金董事會會議後、即擬起程赴新加坡、然後乘飛機返土耳其斯坦坡爾、博士已寓該處三年、任美國女子高等學校校長、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗市無生氣　買賣兩稀：市價續疲</h3>

<h3>糧食　近期粉麥活潑趨漲</h3>
<p>粉市以北洋實銷活動、市面頗見緊張、近期接近現貨、形勢更佳、且北帮　裝現粉外、亦有在近月拖進、遠月在上午開市後、因洋麥報大、市面一度與近月同漲一分以上、午後天晴、行廠套大、市又回小、惟近月被實銷問津、市乃始終見俏、收市四月大二分半、五月大二分、六七月各大二厘半、八月不動、九月小五厘、</p>
<p>麥昨美麥坎麥坎麥電報、各大六七八角、市上空氣極佳、標麥近遠各月份一律上升、近期因現麥缺乏、更形挺站、遠月因天氣已晴、內地行號商販隨市套賣、故午後市即回小、結果四月收價大四分、七八月祗各大一分、九月小一分、現麥廠辦仍活、昨開二千五百包、價又步漲二三分、高車麥已至三元八角半次三元八角二分、</p>

<h3>洋米內地去路不衰　本米銷路不振</h3>
<p>（洋米）內地去化仍貪、本街與長江胃口已淡、惟江浙內地辦興極濃、昨日辦去西貢小絞暹邏高次各米近萬包外、又辦西貢穀二千五百包、茄辣地糙米一千包、西貢小絞期貨四百噸、本街與其他客戶祗去尙洋米三四千包、因內地暢銷、市乃步升、各米一律續大五六分、洋穀則步大六七分、茄辣地糙久無交易、昨以內地歡迎、價至九元半、客秈昨祇內地辦去千餘包、價居定局、</p>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源忽見轉多、共到有四十號、（貨共近八千石）、而銷塲本街旣屬平常、其客帮亦祇感海衛帮辦四百餘包、故人心稍軟、大局市形漸漸垂疲、如各厚粳除高料者見定外、其中市貨悉與各晚稻價均小角許、陰變元去路亦淡、市態同現軟勢耳，</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源二三十號、市上各貨交易淡弱、市價白粳高貨小數分、中次價跌一二角、早薄稻價小近角、其餘各貨亦見疲勢、</p>
<h3>黃豆銷暢價疲之成因　—粤加進口稅暫時急辦—</h3>
<p>昨日黃豆市况、依然穩定、但照銷塲而言、市風須看挺漲、惟礙於廣州加增進口稅在二十一日前實行、致廣汕兩帮去勢大暢、故執貨者趁該兩帮在急進中、鬆售脫貨、致市氣反被撳低矣、昨計廣汕兩帮成交漢口遲豆四千餘包、四平街豆十四五車、范家屯豆十三四車、西城豆二車、肥河豆一車、內地本街及油廠辦去穎州豆三車、蚌埠豆二車、毫州豆三車、漢口乍豆三百餘包、以上各豆行情請看市價欄、</p>
<h3>糖市　潮靑成交復增　—開出千餘包—</h3>
<p>昨日糖市、因產價報升、而加稅之說複盛、故人心活動、均不願即售、趨勢遂緊、公會劃盤二四粗砂白、叫十七冗八角、轉口貨五元八角、八九號荷赤呌十三元、太古糖B嘜言十八元三角、均未成交、本廠綿白振裕一號十七元二角、比升一角、二三四號照退潮靑以開價尙屬平直、雖値去胃未旺、但後市風險甚小、是以屯戶心思仍濃、昨共成交一千餘包、計黃崗靑十元四五角、高半南靑九元八角半至八角、惠來靑九元七角半至七角、隆靑九元六角至五角、其中多數、均係屯戶收進、市象穩定、</p>
<h3>南北貨　蘭花子行盤轉鬆</h3>
<p>蘭花子近日稍有續到、但完全黃亮香氣濃厚之貨、竟付缺如、行存均係普通為多、故售盤反見回鬆、比之高價時降去一二元、惟查統市存數、確已有限趨勢平定、</p>
<h3>絲茶　摩洛哥綠茶報跌</h3>
<p>摩洛哥綠茶市况、近來頗形呆滯、路莊珍眉珠茶、因本年輸入之貨、定價異常低廉、致原有市上存茶、不得不被迫降跌、據法茶商報稱、現高莊珍眉價每基羅挫跌六十法郞、珠茶跌四十五法郞、針眉秀眉等項、亦跌三十法郞、此種市情、於本年綠茶前途、頗為不利云、</p>
<h3>五金　白鐵瓦走銷頗暢利</h3>
<p>白鐵瓦交易、近來十分活潑、客帮若天津烟臺靑島西安諸帮、均有收辦、而本街建築帮生意、亦頗流利、是以市情殊甚良好、標準行情、因到缺存薄、故節節上升、如二十四號、每擔（市擔）估十一元五六角、二十六號十二元五角、二十八號十三元三四角、比之先後均各好起二三角不一、聞二十四號現貨、更甚寥少、所以執貨者心思愈為優秀、是以行情一層、非其他花色所能比較、三十號花色因東貨到貨頗衆、所以行情方面、尙無大榮辱、</p>
<h3>油市　白桐油大跌後小回漲</h3>
<p>白桐油自漢市洋莊漲至四十二元後、已覺登峯造極、未幾因出口去路稍懈、由四十元外而連跌至三十五六元、最近更跌至三十三元七角、時纔旬日、竟鬆去十元稍弱、跌勢之烈、實為近年來所無、現之猛跌、亦前漲所造成也、而今日之跌、或即造成未來之漲、從事斯業者不可不注意也、據漢電所報、市面已略有轉機、洋莊價格加起六角、已售至三十四元三角、如是則漲勞已露端倪矣、</p>

<h3>俄國文學中的死</h3>
<p>— 立波</p>
<p>『俄國貴族文學，不描寫「强盜」，而優秀地描寫了「死靈魂」，「活屍」，「死之家」，「黑暗之勢力」，「三死」，及其他許多的死。』高爾基在一篇論文裏說過這樣的話。</p>
<p>不祇是貴族文學，在整個舊俄文學中，死成了最觸目的主題，許多偉大的天才，都很生動地描寫了各樣的死，我們知道有朶斯托益夫斯基的難堪的死，屠格　夫和契訶夫的憂鬱的死，安特列夫的「恐怖與瘋狂」的死，就是替人類帶來了「金色的夢」的苦難時代的高爾基自己，也描寫出不少的可怕的死，看了「我的童年」裏的雪格那的猝死，大家總有些驚悸吧，而「奧羅夫夫婦」（Orloff　Couple）中更充滿了虎列拉患者的慘死。</p>
<p>沙皇治下的現實，因為資本制度的半身不遂，有大地的飢饉，地主的殘酷的剝削，還有哥薩克憲兵的鐵蹄，民衆的死亡，成了最尋常的事，文學中的死的充滿，是毫不為奇的罷。</p>
<p>然而，因為出身不同，死也有種種姿態。</p>
<p>「窮人」要的克羅夫斯基，頻死時還要求「看一看白晝，看一看上帝的靈輝，看一看陽光，」這是小市民知識分子的死，這樣的憂鬱的死在屠格涅夫書裏可以找出許多。</p>
<p>然而優雅地描寫了知識分子的死的屠格湼夫，也描寫了另外一種不同的死。在「獵人日記」裏他描寫農民馬克西姆被樹打壞，將死的時候，記着他昨天剛剛給了定錢買着的馬，請人家留給他的妻。在這裏，作者嘆着氣說：「可憐的馬克西姆的死不由得使我靜想起來，俄國的農人死起來多奇怪呀，他垂死前的情况，旣不能稱為冷淡，也不能稱為遲鈍，他死起來彷彿舉行禮儀一般，又冷靜，又隨便。」</p>
<p>記得契訶夫的一個短篇中，一個馬車夫，因為車輪陷在深雪裏，推不動，也不願意把馬車留棄在雪的原野，就坐在車上，活生生地凍死了。這種輕於鴻毛的死，在其他偉大的作家書中，也數見不鮮。描寫了「死靈魂」「外套」的戈哥理，又描寫了另外一種英勇的壯烈的死，斯拉夫民族，正因為有這種死，才免除了其他一切無謂的慘死罷，這就是泰賴斯·波爾巴的死。</p>
<p>泰賴斯。波爾巴，這白髮的英勇的戰士，所引導的軍隊失敗了，自己成了殘酷的敵人的俘虜。敵人把他用鐵鍊縛住，手高高地被釘在樹枝上，在他的下面堆着乾柴，他們要把他活活地燒死。然而這可敬的老頭子，一點也沒有注意個人將臨的可怕的命運，他還在樹上急急地呌出他的部隊的逃路：「人們，河邊去，河邊去！由左面的路走到岩壁下面去，河邊有船。上船，他們捉不到你們了。」這樣，他歡喜地看着自己的部隊逃了，回轉頭來驕傲地罵着敵人，「然而火已經從乾柴上面升起來了：火包裹了他的脚，火焰伸展到樹……」</p>
<p>這樣的壯烈的殉道者的死，在「潰滅」一樣的新的作品中，我們也可以看見，但是，那是有了更高尙的意義的。</p>
<h3>彩票</h3>
<p>— 仃</p>
<p>那種具有非常誘惑力量的獎券，終於打動了這顆一生儉樸底老人之心了。</p>
<p>素來是淸心恬靜，安逸幽居的。一向就沒有什麼貪得意外錢財的那種邪念；特別關於富有冒險性的賭博，她不但從未沾染，而且自己往往以道種不良底惡行，勸戒她的親屬及後輩。就是縱使家里有什麽三朝兩日之類的節日，在別的人家呢，雖然不是沈湎於賭博的漩渦中，但有時也不免趁趁熱鬧。然而她呢，這一家，在黃佬的嚴厲約東之下，絕不會馬虎的。</p>
<p>可是到了晚邊，過去的那種家風，完全已經改頭換面了。此刻黃佬自己也不能自制，一種劇烈的衝動不時地在她的心坎上動着。對於自己的言行，她彷彿也不覺地疑惑起來了。</p>
<p>「怎麽會變成這樣的哩？」有時也會那麽詫異地問着她自己</p>
<p>然而，一想到纍纍黃金的時候，她的眼睛就會紛花，心頭也就騷動起來。這樣地使她有時陷於一種進急及煩燥的狀態里也有。總之，現在不是過去那樣淸性寡慾了。</p>
<p>「五十萬頭獎啊！……」她會滔滔不絕地對別人說「五十萬！你們曉得嗎？咱們村上頂有錢的那林家，也不過三十萬，三十萬頂多。他就在咱們的村上稱皇稱帝，作威作福了。吿訴你們，倘托了天祐給我老人家中了五十萬，那不是比他姓林的還要體面嗎？其實，就是五萬吧，那儘够了。咱們一生一世也用不了的。除了那樣的一宗橫財之外，咱們那里能够賺得那麽多的錢？積三代八代也積不下的。所以　，吿訴你們，咱只花費它一塊，（雖然一塊也不是少數目的，）可是你們想呵！……咱們有五萬塊頭獎的運氣呀，世間上有什麼事比這更上算哩？沒有的，所謂一本萬萬利，就是這個意思啦。」</p>
<p>這樣地說了大堆之後，掀開了她皺紋重重的臉，瞇細着眼睛，長久地凝望着她兩個親戚</p>
<p>「這話實在是中聽的，你老人家人比以前想得開通多了。只要咱們有錢，誰不會向咱們三跪九叩哩！到時，咱們還可以蓋蓋房子，買田地，放債，收租，留給咱們子子孫孫許多多的錢。」</p>
<p>張媽也起勁地對她說。</p>
<p>可是坐在她傍邊的李媽，心里便覺得十分不舒服，於是怪氣憤的對她們說：「話固然那麼說，心自然這樣想，可是………那種事咱們最好不要去想它。想不得的，黃媽，張媽，你們說對不對？窮人不會有運數的，這也楚你……」她瞧瞧黃佬「對我說過的：何家，楊家，劉家，蔣家……他們都是敗在賭上頭。就是眼前——說句不要動氣的話，張媽你也不是敗在賭上面嗎？」她又轉臉瞧瞧張媽「不然怎會挨到今日這秈苦頭：冷沒穿，餓沒吃，弄到東乞西求，被人瞧不起，這都是自己不好呀……」。</p>
<p>黃佬張媽給她說了有點過不去，但細心一想：這也是李媽一番好意，於是張媽先開口：</p>
<p>「人愈窮，愈想錢，李媽，像咱們這種窮人家，不想法找點錢，怎能過得下日子哩！就不說遠的，黃佬吧，她從前不是節節省省的，現在為啥還是和你一樣過着苦日子啦！所以……碰碰運數啊！李媽。」</p>
<p>「不錯，咱們靠碰碰運數呀！」黃佬也高興起來了。</p>
<p>「碰一生也碰不着的！嘿，你們將辛辛苦苦地剩下的錢白白地送給別人家，眞是……」</p>
<p>聽了這樣的話，她們都覺得沒趣，李媽也不響了。於是大家就分散了。</p>
<p>在大家走了以後，黃佬於是急急地差人買了條彩票。牢牢地把它放在袋子裏。從這時起，她日夜的等待着：開彩日子的到來，五萬塊錢的頭獎。她日夜繼續地想着，祈禱着，把六七十歲不堪煩苦的精神，完全集中於彩票，瞧着這彩票，使她會聯想到未來一切富貴的憧憬。瞧着這彩票，使她木然地失掉了以往的一種恬靜底恒心及幽閒的安居而陷淪於此刻那麼凌亂及煩擾里。</p>
<p>這樣地挨過不少底楚痛的時日之後，終於開彩的日子到了，當她聽到一種失望的報告時，眼前覺得突然一團黑！</p>
<h3>大雷雨之夜</h3>
<p>— 邵冠華</p>
<p>大雷雨擊撞海岸，</p>
<p>海岸低了下去。</p>
<p>沿海邊的高柳，</p>
<p>也像被拔起來了。</p>
<p>電光閃在平原上，</p>
<p>草和花哭似的抱着。</p>
<p>說不定星光的微笑，</p>
<p>也會因之减少。</p>
<p>茅屋前更是雜亂，</p>
<p>階上充滿滴流。</p>
<p>風和雨在交扇着，</p>
<p>滴破窮人之心啊。</p>
<h3>巨卿先生（十三）</h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>像一匹迷失在荒郊的老馬，前後左右都沒有一條可走的路，他深深的苦惱着。</p>
<p>一天午後，他正在忙着批改學生的習字，忽然學校裏的齋夫老泉送來了一封信。巨卿先生的心狂跳着，雙手抖抖索索地把信拆了開來，裏面祗有一張油印的表格，××縣九區××鎭塾師調查表。是敎育局寄給區立小學校轉發的。調查私塾的事情被證實了。　　呆呆地望着那表格上的詳細項目：姓名，籍貫，年齡，出身……怎麼辦呢？塡了不好，不塡，更不好。找幾個塾師商議一下吧，可會不會惹人家好笑？？……他不願意。</p>
<p>挨延了兩天，越猶預心裏越亂，越是打不定主意。而同時外面的空氣却變得更聚。</p>
<p>「學堂裏已經出了吿示，就要來捉私塾了」。——沈慶中這天早上遇見學校裏的同學，這麽吿訴他；這話就被他搬到巨卿先生的蒙館裏來了。</p>
<p>聽着這樣的話，巨卿先生的心上立刻擱了一塊千斤的磨石，更急了。到處打聽着，又打聽不出一點端倪來。</p>
<p>在黃曆簿上翻到了第二天正是個星期日，學校裏放假，沒有人的時候。他差了兩個年長的學生，翻翻覆覆叮嚀了幾十通！呌他們到學校裏去探看一下，有什麽吿示就鈔了來。</p>
<p>等着半個多鐘頭就像他後半世的歲月那麽長，那麽難挨。千辛萬苦地等回來了，却空着变手。</p>
<p>「有吿示嗎」？趕快問。</p>
<p>「有的」。</p>
<p>「為什麼不鈔下來」？</p>
<p>「因為，因為，吿示很多，我們看不懂」！</p>
<p>沉默了許多時候。一個冒險的念頭在巨卿先生激烈地打仗。終於——</p>
<p>「學堂裏有人嗎」？又問。</p>
<p>學生搖搖頭：「一個人也沒有」。</p>
<p>沒法可想了，巨卿先生又忐忐忑忑了好一會，壯着膽，叮囑學生好好的讀書，决定自己去探一探險。</p>
<p>學校的校舍是由水月菴改的（連校產也是沒收了菴裏的）二門邊的韋　還沒有撤去，威風凛凜地翹起一隻脚站在神龕裏，手裏的金鞭却已斷了半截。放寒假的時候巨卿先生曾經來偷看過幾次，貼吿示的「揭示處」在什麽地方，他知道。這地方他原是熟悉的。</p>
<h3>初次會面</h3>
<p>— 李輝英</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>—遊湖雜寫之一—</p>
<p>在細雨中來到杭州，又在細雨下到西湖邊上漫步着了。時候在午後五點半鐘。</p>
<p>雨的湖上，本來叫遊人一望就會掃興的，但當這傍晚時節，讓雨霧濛罩着湖面，這幅糢糊不淸的輪廓，夾雜着綠柳紅花，倒也别有一番情趣。划子在水中來往，遠看去活像一些大的黑魚。西湖，幾年來就聞名而苦於無機賞識的西湖，現在居然得以會見了。是初次會面啊。</p>
<p>我還有吳先生，兩個人走上湖中的一條土堤，說是土堤，堤面已然鋪了一層柏油了。</p>
<p>「這該是蘇堤吧？」</p>
<p>我一邊走着，一邊望着湖面和遠處埋在雨雲之內的山峯，輕輕地說。我們全是第一次來遊湖的，對於這裏的湖山全然陌生，只是因為從前聽說西湖有一條堤叫蘇堤，就想到了。</p>
<p>「也許是吧。」</p>
<p>吳先生慢聲應着，一壁轉過身子躱過身旁開上堤路的公共汽車。</p>
<p>「這個橋，」我們走到一個橋上，「一定是斷橋。不是有偭」斷橋殘雪」的景緻麽。」</p>
<p>我說完話，人已經走下橋了，吳先生點點頭。他是同意我的說法。</p>
<p>（可是第二天經黃先生解說之後，才知道我們以為是蘇堤的原是白堤，斷橋倒沒有猜錯。）</p>
<p>天漸漸暗下去了，四外的電燈閃射着光亮，被雨絲遮得淡淡的。</p>
<p>我們還可以在糢糊的雨霧夜幕中，看得見附近山上矗立的灰塔，塔的近旁有崢嶸堅硬的山石和碧緣柔嫩的垂柳，再下，就是一排排的洋房子。</p>
<p>「這是什麽塔呢，」我說着，一雷峯塔，不對，」我忽然想起來雷峯塔聽說已經倒掉了，「那麽是保叔塔吧。」</p>
<p>「一定是的。雷峯塔確己倒毀了。」</p>
<p>我們慢慢走着，又走過一個橋，再往前，看到一家白灰的屋壁上寫着「平湖秋月」四個墨字。「平湖秋月，」彷彿聽別人說也是西湖的「十景」之一來的，但是擺在我們面前的只有四個字，此外，看不到風景獨特的地方，我禁不住說：</p>
<p>「看來，地方風景的得名，有些是藉命名而得名的「平湖秋月」就該是屬於這一種的」</p>
<p>（第二天走了幾個地方之後，我證實我的話語並未說錯醫如「九里松原」「曲院荷風」同樣是只留出好聽的名字，而沒有什麽風景的。）</p>
<p>我們走過中山公園的後門，那裏有石　可以走上去，吳先生想進去看看，但是天已經完全黑了，而且雨還不止，所以我提議說。。</p>
<p>「回去罷，等明天再遊。」　　緊接着我又說：</p>
<p>「祈祷明天晴天就好了。」他笑了。</p>
<p>「好罷，我們回去罷。」</p>
<h3>去年畢業的同學</h3>
<h3>義和團彈詞（上）</h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>關於庚子事變彈詞，吳研人的一種是最有名的。此外，潭溪生也著有一部，呌做「義和團演義」。這同樣是一部先發刋於新聞紙，到宣統三年纔印成單行本的書。凡兩卷，二十回，石印，有揷圖。書前有序，說明寫作此書主旨，在呌大家「安不忘危，痛定思痛，」因為當時雖然遭受了那樣巨大的慘禍，「迨至和議旣成，羣情頓異，驕侈淫佚之習，復中於人心，敷衍塞責之風，仍被於天下，」作者遂感而作此。全書的叙述，始於淸平縣武舉與敎民衝突·官吏左袒敎民，釀成武舉復仇·率五百弟子·殺死兩敎民全家；終於「聖駕蒙塵」，駐蹕懷來縣·諭李鴻章為全權代表·與各國公使議和。这部書不是一部有怎樣了不起的價値的著作，但突出才子佳人彈唱的範圍，來應用到政治社會方面，終竟是一件可喜的事。作者所取的立塲，是反義和團，反扶助義和團的一些大臣官吏，反帝國主義的屠殺。尤其使他痛恨的，是官吏們把良善的人民當作匪徒，甚至把全村洗刦。所以，在書的一開塲，他就唱着一個大臣去剿匪，把一個善良的村子全部洗刦，直到事過以後，才知道那裏並沒有什麽匪徒：</p>
<p>枉殺人民千百衆，算來不到半時辰。看看莊內無人影，霧退天晴望得淸。統領便敎兵紮住，自携戈什入莊村。滿街屍首無人跡，幾處民房刦火焚。信步行來不覺遠，抬頭一望陡然驚。走到一處，只見面前一所小廟，寫着「關帝廟」三個大字，廟前搭了一座戲台，台上堆了多少戲衣，與那槍刀劍戟之類，這時亦被砲彈打的東倒西歪，七零八落。再看，地下的屍首，也有抹着花臉的，也有戴着鬍鬚的，亦有打去一腿的，亦有洞穿肚皮的，一個個躺在地下。世敦看了一回，忽然明白，阿呀一聲道：「不好了，是他們在這裏演戲酬神，並不是興妖作怪，誤剿良民，如何是好？」於是無精打彩，急急跑回營盤，自己搜尋主意。（第二卷）</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>談「悠閒玩世」</h3>
<p>— 史蒂</p>
<p>春光明媚，綠草如茵，這正是一個大好的「遊樂」天氣。中國人別樣事都不甚見長，獨對這所謂「遊樂」兩字，算來並不後人。咱不必故意窮搜什麼例證，只須隨便回頭想想，我們的古人，所謂雅士，所謂高人，他們對「遊樂」的玩意兒，總不會輕易錯過。而且玩的都很有名目，四時八節，不論那一個期間，各有各的特色：「春遊芳草地，夏賞綠荷河，秋飲黃菊酒，冬吟白雪詩。」一年三百六十日，在工於玩樂的我們中國底所謂高人雅士的目中，可說無時無刻不在那裏計劃着如何玩樂了。</p>
<p>所以。絕代詩人的李白，春夜大宴於桃園，叙天倫的樂事。惆悵風流的王羲之，及時修禊於蘭亭。這都是我們高雅的古人，在春天時一種「遊樂」的韻事，至今還深深地印在一般自命風流人物的腦際。至於「秋高氣爽，孟嘉落帽於龍山」。和不願為五斗米而折腰的陶淵明，大唱「歸去來辭」，到家裏優遊地過着「採菊東籬下，悠然見南山」的生活，不更證明我們的古人，是一個怎樣「悠閒」，工於「遊樂」的主義者？</p>
<p>眞的，這些古人，說來是應有他們的玩樂的。他們在那個時候，「天下太平」。而且每一個高人雅士，也都在朝廷任有相當好的職司，旣不要替國家操什麽心思，又不須愁個人的什麼生活。滿肚皮學問，滿肚皮「太閒空」的牢騷，要做事無事可做。研究學問吧，學問倒底有時而盡，自己已經是個博學之士了。研究科學，當時根本就不知道有這樣一個東西。沒有話說，不是那麼的「玩世」一生，却呌再做些什麼？所以，他們的「悠閒玩世」，也正是他們的機會。</p>
<p>現在，又是所謂的春天了。又到了李白王羲之他們玩樂的好時候了。不知工於玩樂的我們中國人，又在做些什麽玩兒？不錯，此一時，彼一時，從前古人們的春天遊玩，不過修　山林，對花飲酒。現在中國人的玩樂，已如西方的文明，花樣翻新，除了玩山，玩水，踏靑，賞花，還有跳舞，電影，以及一切更新奇的消遣，我們正不用愁「悠閒」者的「玩世」行徑，會有冷落的一天。</p>
<h3>一個人底最後</h3>
<p>— 凌秄錫</p>
<p>傍晚，人家剛準備生起火煮飯的當兒，長福家裏透出了一陣啕嚎的哭聲：村頭的婦人們大家意識地望了一眼：長福老爹終於那麼輕鬆鬆地「倒下來」了。</p>
<p>在河灘上淘着米的桂寳姐　了　嘴，順便又做了一個怪臉：「哼，他也有那麽一天哩。」</p>
<p>「自然咾！倒底是人啊，千頂眞萬頂眞，還是頂眞不過閻王伯伯。苦了的却是長福媳婦一個。」</p>
<p>「苦了的却是長福媳婦一個啊。」</p>
<p>長福媳婦是活生生的在二十三歲的年紀上給磨折死了；而今是：代表着這古舊之一代的長福老爹，却也在二一聲稀疎的哭聲中馳去了呢。</p>
<p>村頭的人，有誰忘得了長服媳婦的活生生的印象的？</p>
<p>那麼一個胖胖的，結實的姑娘：皮色有點黑黝黝的，「原生脚」，烏黑的眼珠，做點「傭生」是着實來得的；每天挑三五担子水，捉二十來斤棉花，連哼都不哼一聲。人是個不大開口的，只曉得巴結地「做」，不偸懶，做人也和氣，譬如說：村頭的人大家都在河灘頭淘米洗菜的當兒吧，看見有老婆婆或者是大了肚子的「嫂嫂」，不用人家縐眉梢嚷腰痛，她就走攏來給你弄這樣弄那樣的帮起來了，嘴又不「尖」，從來不曾搬過一句兩句嘴舌。像那樣的一個傢伙，「人緣」當然是怪好的了。不是嗎？村裏的人就沒有講長福媳婦的坏話的人：要有，那便就只有長福老爹一個了。</p>
<p>長福媳婦嫁過來的時侯還只有十七歲，那时長福老爹可已經得了瘋濕病了。每天只是吃飽了坐在太陽裏作難人：長福老爹的「難弄」是在全村子裏出了名的。當長福媳婦嫁過來的時候，便有人說過了：「可憐的是羔羊落在狼羣裏了。」</p>
<p>長福是個沒有用的「燈籠殼子」，每天只知道拿了三個銅子上茶館去嚼蛆，回來吃了了中飯打個呵欠，便又猪一般地躺在竹筿上睡去了，連農忙的時節都不管事：長福媳婦有的時候忙得連氣都透不過來，呌他來帮忙的時候，長福老爹却先罵起來了：</p>
<p>「鄉下人是供不起少奶奶的啊，滿胖的個子，連這點生活都吃不下，還要去喊男人：男人的志氣是給你作踐完了！」</p>
<p>長福媳婦可難過起來了：可是自己是壯盛的，便把落下來的眼淚吞到肚子裏，又急急地奔向塲上去了：一句在話肚子裏盤旋着；「十年媳婦十年婆，再過十年做太婆，要是有了一個孩子，日子便好過些了吧？」</p>
<p>但是一想起孩子，心裏便像有一根尖針在刺着一樣的難受了：她想起有一天油坊裏的麻皮給她說的話：「長福是個沒用的俺貨啊……」，想起心頭像淋了冷水一樣的，冷下去，冷下去。</p>
<p>但是後來的三年中，長福老爹却天天一見她就駡：「白虎星，白虎星啊！來了二三年，男的身子也給你蹧蹋完了，屁也沒看見撒一個！白虎星啊……」</p>
<p>打，罵，用繩子綑，便那麽地磨折了三年，到了第四年的春上，便一口怨氣，活生生地帶着舊時代的　影，跳到井裏去了。</p>
<p>而現在，就是代表着這頑惡的一代的長福老爹都死去了。村裏的靑年全像吐過了一口氣：是一個人的最後；但也是整個的一代的最後了呢。</p>
<h3>渴慕者</h3>
<p>— 容</p>
<p>住在萬人如海的大都市裏，房子小得正如一般人所形容的鴿棚，永遠是灰現的天，野獸哀嗥般的汽笛與車聲，這樣的心裏，便逐漸培育起對於廣闊的陸地或海洋之渴慕。有時像囚人從獄室中解放出來那樣，走到不遠的海口和靜靜躺在都市背後的村落裏，有靑的天與靑的水，綠的葦藻襯着的帆影，小草花在艷陽中怡然自得地顫得搖曳，在那邊可以用整個耳朵來聽，整個眼晴來看，整個靈魂來感受當前的一切，心底便油然生出一種感激的愈快。可是這幸福的霎那過去之後，依然戴上世俗的枷鎖：俗人的臉，無謂的談話，，柴木油鹽的努力，窄得像是把自己壓扁的等於沒有窗的屋子，把一個人的精神加以慘酷的碟刑，這樣吃肉打哈哈把日子混過去了。但生在井底的人有時也想觀天，那幾乎不可抗拒的熱病樣的對於自然之渴慕就會出其不意地纏繞住自己的全身。</p>
<p>我最近的心中，常感到一種無法慰藉的渴慕，想在廣闊無垠的沙漠中奔跑，想到海濱呼嘯唱歌，想在高山的巔上看那漫漫四合的雲海，和照臨四六的莊嚴的旭日之東昇，想在一片寂靜無人原野中躺着，被夜風吹拂，看千萬顆繁星的影子，有一次做了夢，夢到太陽把金光鍍上粼粼的海波，海波的白痕不住侵襲那沙灘，我赤着脚在沙灘上迎着太陽跳舞，那一瞬間光明崇高的快感簡直浸透了我的心胸，漫遍了我的四肢，迷朦在望的島嶼，、一艘連着一艘的漁船，映着陽光晶晶發亮的如貴婦人珠鑽樣的貝殼的微妙淸淑像一縷孤簫聲籟似的晨風，只在給這可憐人以片刻的滿足後，便成為無數追憶與怨嗟的資料，倚着枕，想夢裏的經過，只要一睜開眼，那慘重難當的黃色屋頂的印象便沒頭沒臉地籠罩下來。</p>
<p>我說：這簡直是一種苦刑。</p>
<p>看白畫換黑夜，又看黑夜換天明，</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>如是，我靜靜地渴慕者，在我衫子下的一顆包含着希望又包含着失望的心裏，交織着斑爛的花紋，靑嫩的樹叢，奇突而險　的萬仞山峯，海，海上，太陽，拂掠着徽　的原野，草花，一川小溪的明媚，一個夕暮的哀婉，靜夜高高在上的金星，鷗鳥與征帆，和一大串春夏秋冬變幻無窮的璨爛的日子，這種渴慕包庇着我，如一個慈母包庇着襁褓中的嬰兒，僅僅把這種願望拿出來溫理一遍，自己似乎已經和這喧囂的城市隔離了。</p>
<h3>詩人日記</h3>
<p>— 一郞</p>
<p>一天的黃昏，獨個子在公園裏逛逛，走到那卜面泉水潺潺地在奏霓裳羽衣之曲的假山上，正要找個地方休息，就在那石頭脚下發現了這麽所記的一小本子。想是詩人的日記了。</p>
<p>三月十三日　春來了，想起小潭裏的靑蛙，合柳浪裏的黃鶯兒，她們不是已經在唱着春之歌了麼？應該寫下一兩首詩迎春一迎春才對。可是，想了大半天，只得了兩句，不是有「小詩」的體裁麽？亦可以呌「俳句。」就算是俳句吧。錄下：「花兒的臉多麽紅呵，湖水亦起了漣漪！」</p>
<p>三月十四日　為了寫詩，是應該到野外迎春去的。合妻商量，今天上龍華看桃花去，今年桃花開得早。俗物的她，就因了這事合我吵了一塲。說什麽失業倒不放在心上，看桃花，記性就這麽好，…將遊興趕跑個一乾二凈，將詩興更驅上九霄雲外。女人們眞是沒辦法，…不講理的。失業，失業，老是提起失業，我不是早已經告訴你麼？「以後不要提起失業的話？」可是她今天又提起？失業已經就失業了，提起又有什麽用？如果不呌我寫寫詩，我的精神向什麼地方寄托？…世界上最偉大的，莫如詩人，只有做詩人才能够天天浸在香甜的夢裏。</p>
<p>三月十五日　昨天夜裏妻一因為小拜倫在哭，就向我發牢騷，什麽不好聽的粗俗話都衝出口來了，眞是。我不是自己願意失業的喲，你發牢騷，我的牢騷比你更多。好好的敎書，敎了七八年，誰料到今日裏就是吃粉筆灰坐冷板凳亦不成呢？你駡我沒有本事，那一個比得上我，不敎書就做詩人？做詩人不是有本事嗎？朋友們都稱讚我的詩做得好。……小拜倫又在哭了，妻越駡越兇，不管她。呵，詩興來了，—「畫樑燕子解人意，為伴寂寥繞月啼。…」</p>
<p>三月十六日　早晨出門借錢去，又撲了一個空，大家都說市面不景氣沒辦法，老張還在長吁短嘆。長吁短嘆有什麼用呢，這年頭兒？…可是，一回家，剛推開亭子間的房門，妻的難看的臉就迫我不得不學她一樣，縐緊了眉頭兒。我兩手向空剛挑開，她哼了一聲，却流起眼淚來。安慰她一番，說些吹牛的有志氣話，才封住了她的嘴，那要房租的房東太太便出現在房門口了。…今天連寫詩亦不行了。天下最可惡的莫如房東太太。</p>
<p>三月十七日　妻病了。小拜倫得自己抱他，菜亦得自己去買，飯亦得自己燒了，—誰料到詩人做到這樣子？在燒飯的時候聽到隔壁人家的無線電播音，心境愁悶不堪，詩興就來了，可寫不成，抱孩子的時候，詩興又來，趕快拿出日記本子寫上，得一句：「春在樓頭人在樓，…」孩子哭起來，詩思又斷了，眞是！到現在才覺得如此環境做詩人亦不容易。算了吧，從此不做詩人了。</p>
<p>三月十九日　妻的病怎麽越來越利害？應該去請醫生才對吧！可是，請醫生吃藥都得錢，錢呢？只有四隻角子了—…大槪不大要緊吧，看明天如何再說</p>
<p>三月二十日　這可糟了，醫生說妻應該進醫院，就送紅十字會的三等房間亦得錢喲！（上午記）在老韓那邊借到幾塊錢，他跑來帮忙，這才將妻送進醫院去。這時已經是夜裏了，想吃了藥或者可以好些吧？明天一淸早就去看她。可是，這孩子帶來帶去眞討壓。寄在房東太太樓下吧？不知她肯不肯替我招顧一下，明天試試看。</p>
<p>日記寫到這裏便沒有了，空餘着許多白紙，我不知那位詩人的妻病好了沒有，孩子又怎麽樣，在幻想中替他想出許多可怖的事情發生出來，自己不禁打了一個寒噤。這時風吹過，樹梢在蕭蕭地響有，今年的春天怎麽這樣寒冷，夏天還沒有來，竟有點秋氣了。</p>

<p>開篇「春游」</p>
<p>江南春色滿瀛洲。芳草天涯憶　　。會記得繡陌踏靑多艷跡。游春時節興悠悠。訪名勝。話風流。楊柳陰藏蘇小樓。春雲淡綠波稠。曉風殘月一扁舟。鞭絲細。帽影幽。香車寳馬碧於油。來來往往人如織。盡道游春樂意遒。等閒又把淸明過。且向春江把　爪留。一路杏花風蕩颺。山痕幾點快迎眸。賞心樂事誰家院。瀝瀝鶯聲百囀柔。間桃花何處把仙源訪。武陵人還在間否。信步行來花滿路。渡虹橋又過碧溪頭。一帶靡鞠青不斷。枝頭小鳥語軥輈。小立斜陽孤若鶴。嘆韶光身世等浮　。人生日暮如朝露。且尋歡樂莫添愁。正正悠悠多逸趣。忽聽那賣花娘喊破小珠喉。歸來燕子已下簾鈎。</p>

<h3>由歌女而成為影星需要美貌頭腦品德三者齊備</h3>
<p>— 紉琴</p>
<p>我們要先介紹一下，這位琶麗勃克（Billie</p>
<p>Burke）是誰？她是已故紐約的歌舞界鉅子弟洛侖斯齊格飛（Florenz</p>
<p>Ziegfeld）的寡妻。她從前亦是一位著名的歌女，亦曾做過舞臺演員，是位多才多藝美貌的女子。自從她丈夫死後，她不但是位富孀，並且還繼承了她丈夫的事業，而在紐約歌舞界以及電影界佔得一個很高崇的地位。以下就是她所指示的，一個女子成為明星的需要。</p>
<p>她說：「如果有人問我，一個靑年歌女，要在銀幕上成為明星，三個最要緊的條件是什麼？我將很不遲疑地吿訴她一個B字，那就是Beauty，Brains，和Balance三個字（美貌，腦筋，和均衡。）』</p>
<p>因為從歌舞界跑到電影界而成名的女子，旣是如此之多，所以歌舞界就成了美國女子天才最偉大的「樣子間。」但是一個女子要以歌舞引動大衆的注意，不能單用美貌，而必須輔之腦筋。均衡是什麼呢？她亦必定要勤懇學習的毅力，那就要在體力上和精神上有一種均衡持久的力量，才能够姑住脚，吃得住長時間工作的痛苦。均衡還不僅限於體力和精神二者之上，就是在道德上，品性上，有了同樣的修養，才能有同樣堅持澈貫的力量。</p>
<p>琶麗勃克又說：「從前有一個時期，歌女被人視作一種無知無識的女子。她們是富人們的玩物。她們自己呢，或者亦利用了自己的美貌，不惜犧牲色相，去博取富人們的金錢。但是那個時代，除去了一兩個不知自愛者之外，現在已成了過去的陳跡了。</p>
<p>「現在的歌女和以前的不同了。她們都知道敎育她們自己，和普通人在其他事業中的一樣。現在有志向的歌女，和其他有志向的職業女子一樣，已經沒有餘暇，去荒廢在夜生活和浮薄的習慣之中了。如果她們有餘暇的話，她們亦會知道，她們自己的體康和美貌，在晚睡和荒唐生活之中，是不能持久的。</p>
<p>「我記得不過幾年以前，我的丈夫舉行了一次歌女的知識背景的測騐。很可驚的，他發現了歌女們百分之八十三，是進過中學或大學的。其中有許多，是畢業而得有榮譽獎賞的。所以一般普通人所常說的「美人無知識」的話，當然已不再適用於這般歌女了。」</p>
<p>自從齊格飛死後，好萊塢因為電影界許多女明星，却是他生前提倡誘掖出來的，他的勞績不僅限於歌舞界，在電影界亦有同等的功勳，所以現在他們要攝影一張影片，將齊格飛一生事　攝上銀幕，以垂永久。而齊格飛的寡妻琶麗勃克亦就被聘請了，專作選擇排演歌女的工作。</p>
<p>琶麗勃克說：「齊格飛生前選擇歌女的時候，他很自繳的，祗用良善的女子。他一定要一個歌女，在舞臺之下，和在舞臺之上，她的行為要同樣的無可疑問。以事實而論，齊格飛為什麼為社會人十所重視，為什麼為歌女們自已所崇拜，亦就是因為他那嚴肅的態度，著重於一位歌女的品行。如果為了一件事，而必須將某一個歌女加以處份的話，她亦一定心服情願，因為她知道齊格飛是公正無邪的，他的所以如此，亦是為了大家的名譽和前途。</p>
<p>「但是現在為銀幕上的歌舞而選擇歌女，比為舞臺而選擇更覺其困難。她們一定要比明星們還要美貌動人，因為在銀幕閃爍之中，惟有至美麗光彩的面貌，才可以傳到觀衆的注意再則歌舞慕序上的成名，以及她們的最後成為明星，並沒有什麼終南捷徑的。誰要以為歌女的生活，應當比較女演員的生活為舒閒些，她就差了。歌女的生活，和女演員的生活一樣，是至難而至易使人失望的。並且她們要切記的，無論先做歌女，或逕做女演員，她不論僅博貌美而成功。她一定要記住三個B字，就是Beauty，Brains，和Balance</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3>評「寵僕趣史」</h3>
<p>Ruggles　of　RedCap</p>
<p>——國泰——</p>
<p>我先得吿訴讀者諸君，這裏有一個很有趣的故事。不，與其說是有趣，到無寗說劇作者用了喜劇的形式傳達了人類平等的精神。我想反是看過這一影片的人們，决不會忽視劇作者表現了從封建勢力的沒落到新興資本主義的興起，影響到人們思想變遷的過程。很明白的，在沒落之中的貴族，他們將奴僕當作賭物，很隨便的在一塲賭博之中輸給別人了，可是這奴僕到了新興資產階級的美國人手裏，並不善於運用對於奴僕的權威。他們不貫於貴族紳士的習氣，他們將奴僕當作朋友一般的看待。</p>
<p>當然囉，你們可以想像得出，奴才成性的主人公勒格斯，他在封建貴族階級中生長，他習慣了紳士太太們的規矩禮貌，卽使在主人允許他放肆的時候，他也不敢放肆起來，除非在酒醉了的時候，透露了人的本性。可是經過長久的薰陶，在林肯唱導解放黑奴要求人類平等的美國，這來自巴黎貴族的奴僕，漸漸的覺得自己應該有人的地位，於是他讀熟了林肯的演說詞，在民主主義的新興的美國，他是解放了而成為一個正式的公民了。當最後的酒店開張之日，在人們歡唱聲中，他是被承認為「快樂的人」了。</p>
<p>這樣的見解在電影上反應出來，在目前看來，對於美國的所謂的自由邦，自然有其故甚其詞的誇大頌揚，可是在從封建勢力的沒落到新興資本主義的抬頭，作為反應當時現實的這一影片，並非沒有進步的意義的了。因此「寵僕趣史」能有這樣的內容，就已經决定了它存在的價値了。</p>
<p>其次，屬於表現技術方面的觀察，我以為這樣的喜劇，眞是够得上稱為幽默的。一般的說，在美國影片中，很難找着幽默的喜劇。多半是裝腔作勢的滑稽，不近人情的胡鬧，使觀衆們無意識的哈哈大笑，完全在空虛的熱閙上來决定喜劇的價値。但是這「寵僕趣史」却完全例外。我們在這裏找不着無意識的胡閙，也看不到裝腔作勢的滑稽，所有的乃是深刻的幽默表現在對話之中，好像讀着蕭伯納的文章，那樣的耐人尋味。遺憾的是中國觀眾並不能充分的聽懂對白，這樣不免是「寵僕趣史」在中國開映的損失。（當然在其他的外國，也會有同樣之損失的。）</p>
<p>就這一方面來說，以對話來傳達劇情，並不是適當的辦法。而這一影片不能更多的在動作上增加喜劇的效能，並非可取之處。不過導演對於人物的個性之淸楚的把握，特別是對於主人公個性的變換，更由於却爾斯勞頓演技的優良，眞給與人們極好的印象。是的，導演的手法是可取的，他並不在輕薄的笑料上博取人們的歡心，但是他却給與我們雋永的回味。這不僅是在主角却爾斯勞頓身上表現出來，而在瑪麗玻蘭，却利勒格斯諸人的表演中，也可看出對於演技之指導的成就。正確的說對於他，固然不能說是怎樣偉大的成功，但也不能找出若干電影技術的缺憾的了。</p>

<p>雪偷走近了傑姆的身邊道。：「那個警務局的書記，什麼都寫下來了。倘使報館裏的記者看見了那個記錄，怎麼呌他們不用呢？」雪倫說話的時候，顯著很著急的神氣，但是傑姆勃郞却別有見解，他僅僅答應了一聲：「唔，這件事鬧得太兇了。」他答應雪倫怎樣帮忙的話，早己置之腦後了。可是雪倫却忍耐不住起來。她對着傑姆道：「你不是說你能够帮我的忙，使我的朋友的名字不給他們亂用的嗎。現在你好像不在乎似的。你所要的，就是走進了這個大門就算了。我又被你利用了。」她的紅唇顯然的氣得發抖了。</p>
<p>她說完了，不等他回答，就一個人走上樓去了。在樓上一間屋子裏，他們正在查問彭尼斯德。他是自動的來的，來吊唁和安慰亨利柏德森的，因為柏德森就是謀害他老婆的嫌疑犯。柏德森形容憔悴，神志更是昏昏。他對於隔夜的事，已經記憶不淸了，但他對於彭尼斯德貓哭老鼠式的吊唁，却始終鄙棄了不肯接受。雪倫走上了樓，就站在彭尼斯德的身旁，一隻手挽住了他的臂膀說道：「這倒難為了你了。」</p>
<p>彭尼斯德道：「我眞不能相信，亨利會謀害他的夫人的。」這時傑姆勃郞却已經走到他們跟前。他聽了彭尼斯德的話，就接口道：「說得不錯。我亦不相信亨利是殺死他夫人的兇手。但是我却猜到了這是誰幹的事。」彭尼斯德道：「眞的嗎？」傑姆道：「眞的！你就是！」雪倫聽了，臉上陡然罩上了一層灰色的濃霜。她拉著彭尼斯德道：「湯梅，別理他。勃郞却先生很不幸的滑稽得太過份了。更可惜的他不懂得說話的輕重。」</p>
<p>雪倫這時心中對於傑姆勃郞却，可以算得恨到透頂了。讓他去想彭尼斯德和這個案子有什麼關係。讓他去在他的報上造謠言好了。他愛怎樣就怎樣。他是自己給自己當上。她心裏很明白。她在出事的晚上，明明是和彭尼斯德在一起的。這就是她對於傑姆勃郞却報復的時候了。讓他去登載離奇的新聞，後來總有一天水落石出了，他會被大衆恥笑的。她靜待著那天。</p>
<p>可是她亦不用導待很久。當天的下午，新聞記載上面已經印着很大的標題。頭一行就是寫着：「警務局查問彭尼斯德一幾個大字。雪倫看見了那張報，立即跑到新聞記載報的主人佐丹先生那裏。她將她所知道的，從頭至尾，一五一十的講了一遍。她說她曾警吿過勃郞却，不要瞎猜人家的友誼，但是他不聽她的話。她並且說為了她和佐丹先生和佐丹夫人的友誼起見，她不願意眼看着一張有價値的報紙，被一個愚而好自用的編輯弄出笑話來。</p>
<p>佐丹聽了　倫一遍大道理，就立即將傑姆勃郞却呌了進來。傑姆勃郞却一進門，看見了雪倫那各脫就說道：「你是來供給些眞實消息的嗎？」佐丹赫然道：「密司那各脫不是來供給什麽眞實新聞的。她是來指明你的錯誤的。她知道你所猜想的都不對。我很感謝她，她能這樣夾警告我。你呢……你對於這件事，未免太不愼重了。（未完）</p>

<h3>Guantai Dike Closure Completed; Submersible Dam Project a Great Success; Reinforcement of the Jin Dike to be Carried Out in Sections</h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) Kong Xiangrong reported from the Guantai worksite on the 11th that the closure had been completed at Chenshi hours (7-9 am). (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Construction Bureau, recognizing the imminent closure of the Guantai breach, and that post-disaster reconstruction in the province should be expedited, has specially appointed Lv Jinzao, a technical expert from the bureau, as a special commissioner to oversee the dike repairs. He will be responsible for the joint repair of Chinese and foreign small embankments. Technical expert Ouyang Weiyi will serve as a member of the Yellow River Spring Works Supervision Committee, working with the River Affairs Bureau to form a temporary engineering office to expedite the spring works. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government received a telegram on the 10th from Qi Shouan, Director of the Yellow River Affairs Bureau, stating that as a result of the rush construction of the submersible dam and slow-flow dam at Guantai, the main current of the river is trending eastward, and the silting of the breach is occurring exceptionally quickly. With the addition of willow bundles, the breach is now only one to six meters wide. Barring unforeseen circumstances, the entire breach should be above water by tomorrow. Upon receiving the telegram, the province was overjoyed. A responsible person from the Construction Bureau stated that since adopting the submersible dam construction method at Guantai, the technology is so new that it has achieved great success in just a few days. After the breach is closed, the water source will be cut off, and it will not be difficult to close the breaches at Shichejia and other locations. The water level in Changyuan will also drop. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Qin Fen, Secretary-General of the Economic Council, stated that the Guantai dike closure project will continue to be handled by Kong Xiangrong, director of the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee's engineering accounts group. To date, the Ministry of Finance has allocated 450,000 yuan. Currently, the water level has decreased, and the situation is becoming more moderate. According to a recent telegram, the water depth inside the breach is about 20 meters. Given the current situation, if the weather is favorable and the water level does not rise sharply again, it is hoped that the breach can be closed within three months. As for reinforcing the Jin Dike, the Economic Council has confirmed that it is an essential project for managing the Yellow River, and it is of utmost importance to the lives and property of North China. Therefore, all efforts must be made. Once the Jin Dike is completed, the Yellow River will no longer be able to overflow the Jin Dike. Even if the Yellow River changes course, the Jin Dike will serve as a model, eliminating the risk of inundation. Li Yizhi has personally gone to the dike to supervise the repairs, and the Economic Council has allocated 100,000 yuan to start the project. An additional 360,000 yuan will be allocated as needed. Furthermore, the three major construction projects in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, as well as the allocation of funds, have been finalized. A total of 1.08 million yuan is needed, with the central government responsible for 540,000 yuan. To date, 200,000 yuan has been remitted. This project is also underway. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Gu Hongxi, Chief of the General Affairs Section of the Yellow River Conservancy Commission, has arrived in Nanjing from Bian. He stated that the plan for reinforcing the Jin Dike has been decided to be carried out in two sections. The first section is from Puyang to Gaotikou, and the second section is from Gaotikou to Taochengpu. The original budget for the project was 1.08 million yuan, but due to the difficulty in raising funds, the budget has been reduced to 460,000 yuan. The Economic Council has allocated 100,000 yuan, and bidding is now underway. Construction will begin once a contractor is selected and is expected to be completed by July. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Haas Inspects National Construction Progress; Says Great Progress Made in Three Years</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Haas and Wu Xiufeng departed on inspection tours on March 7th. After over a month, the construction situation in the North China and Central China provinces has been inspected. Next week, they will travel from Nanjing to Zhenjiang, and on the 17th, they will go to Shanghai, then to Hong Kong, and then to Guangdong and Guangxi. At the end of this month, they will leave China from Hong Kong and return to the League of Nations to report. This inspection tour route went from Nanjing along the Jinpu Railway to Shandong, then to Tianjin and then to Beiping. Then they took the PingSui Railway to Datong, Hebei, and then traveled by long-distance bus to Taiyuan, Shanxi. After passing through Fengling in Southern Shanxi, they crossed the Yellow River and entered Tongguan, Shaanxi. They took the Longhai Railway to Xi'an and then traveled west by car to inspect the Jinghui and Luohui canals, and paid respects to the Mausoleum of King Wen of Zhou. Leaving Shaanxi and heading east, they took the Longhai Railway to Kaifeng, then transferred from Zhengzhou to the Pinghan Railway to reach Wuhan. Then they traveled by riverboat into Hunan. After completing their work, they followed the river east to Jiujiang and took the Nanxun Railway into Jiangxi, and then went to Yushan. They traveled by car to Hangzhou and returned to Nanjing via the Jinghang Highway. The journey lasted 33 days and covered tens of thousands of miles, including the twelve provinces of Shandong, Hebei, Hebei, Shanxi, Suiyuan, Shaanxi, Henan, Hubei, Hunan, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang. In terms of overall impression, China's construction undertakings and political affairs have progressed rapidly in recent years. When the League of Nations specially dispatched Sir Lytton to China in 1932 to investigate, Mr. Haas was the Secretary-General of the Lytton Commission. Only three years have passed since then, and as a result of this inspection, he believes that the construction in various places has made great progress compared to three years ago, and the political situation is also on track. It can be said that various undertakings in China are moving forward. Analytically speaking: (1) In terms of transportation, Jiangxi and other provinces have completed more than 5,000 kilometers of highways, and the provinces with the least, such as Henan, also have more than 2,000 kilometers of highways, all of which are accessible by automobiles. Other projects under planning and construction are not included in this number. Long-distance telephones have also become widespread. For example, provincial chairmen can use long-distance telephones to talk to county magistrates at any time to inquire about local security. This is a great advancement in transportation construction. (2) Provincial leaders are able to wholeheartedly support the Central Government, which proves that China's political situation has been unified and stabilized. (3) From government leaders to ordinary people, everyone is working hard and striving for construction. This is very different from three years ago when there were many empty words and few facts. Mr. Haas met with Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education on the 11th, and will visit President Wang, President Sun, and Economic Committee members Song Ziwen and Kong Xiangxi in the coming days. He will provide concrete opinions on the situation in various places and make recommendations to the Chinese government on which construction undertakings should be given priority, and which technical personnel should be introduced by the League of Nations, etc. After the authorities adopt and decide on the opinions, Mr. Haas will report to the League of Nations. Wu Xiufeng said that in his opinion, China's water conservancy is an important issue. For example, the Yellow River runs through several provinces, and the river water is fertile, similar to the Nile River in Egypt. If it can be used to irrigate the fields, it would be very beneficial. However, now it is not only unable to be beneficial, but it is also harmful. This urgently needs a solution. Secondly, China's provincial highways are becoming increasingly developed, but the automobiles used still need to be purchased from foreign countries. Our people need these highways mainly to transport agricultural products, but is it appropriate to purchase expensive foreign automobiles? There is also room for consideration in this regard. The opinions of this inspection will be published in writing by Haas before leaving Shanghai. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Red Spear Society and Tax Police Clash in Nangle County, Hebei</h3>
<p>(Tianjin) On the 7th, the Red Spear Society and tax police clashed in Nangle County, Hebei, resulting in fierce fighting for several hours. Two tax police were injured and one died. Three members of the Society were killed and many were injured. The Nangle County Magistrate and local gentry rushed to the front lines of both sides and tried their best to mediate. A ceasefire was temporarily reached on the evening of the 7th, but they are still facing each other. The reason for the conflict between the Red Spear Society and the tax police in Nangle County is still the tax police destroying the saltpeter ponds. The Society members claimed that they were defending the rights of the people. They gathered more than 3,000 people and approached Nangle County City, accusing the tax police district team of deceiving the people. They had already agreed not to destroy the saltpeter ponds for the time being, but why did they proceed with the destruction? The tax police were very angry and went out of the city to engage in fierce fighting. It is said that this matter is quite difficult to mediate. There is also unstable news about the Red Spear Society in Daming, Jin Shengdao. (11th Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Zunhua Sends Security Team to Suppress Bandits Entering from Outside</h3>

<h3>Remnant Bandits in Guizhou Fleeing Eastward Across the River; Central Army in Pursuit; Chairman Chiang Orders One-Year Exemption from Land Tax in Guizhou Province</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) According to a telegram from Guiyang, the main force of the bandits began to flee across the Qingshui River from Yinghua Ferry, Xindu Ferry, Niudu Ferry, and Shuiwei on the 6th, seemingly fleeing eastward towards Jiuzhou via Wengping and Wendi. On the afternoon of the 7th, there were still bandit rear guards in the Lantianwan Shuiwei area. They were able to cross the river on the evening of the 7th. Our army is in hot pursuit and has divided into teams to intercept. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>Guiyang: Although the Central Government Army in Guizhou is trying its best to have a major showdown with the communist bandits, the communist bandits are still adopting a strategy of avoiding battle. After the communist bandits stopped fleeing east into Hunan Province, the Government Army hoped to strike them hard at Longli, about twenty miles from Guiyang. However, last night, the main force of the bandits retreated rapidly to the south through winding mountain paths. Then, under pressure from the Government Army, they turned westward. Among the bandits, there was a coffin covered with red cloth. If the corpse in the coffin is not Zhu De, it must be another important bandit leader. According to reliable statements from bandit prisoners, Zhu De has died from his injuries. Chairman Chiang, seeing the extreme suffering of the people of Guizhou, many of whom were selling their children to pay taxes, was deeply sympathetic. Today, he ordered a one-year exemption from land tax in Guizhou Province and ordered the provincial army to abolish the practice of requisitioning grain from the people. Since the arrival of the Government Army in Guiyang, the environment has been peaceful and business is booming. Many new stores have been added in recent days. Soldiers are paying in cash for their purchases, which the store owners greatly appreciate, as it is a reversal of the old practice of forced purchases. The people of the province have scheduled a general meeting for April 15th to express their gratitude to Chairman Chiang, but Chiang has strongly stopped this event as it would be wasteful and extravagant during a time of hardship. (10th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The remnants of the Xiao He bandit gang, who had been entrenched in western Hunan, have suffered heavy casualties after repeated encirclement and suppression. The remnants have collapsed towards the Tawo area. On the morning of the 8th, they were pursued by our Luo Qijiang brigade and are in the midst of fierce fighting. A part of our Guo Runian division arrived and jointly launched a fierce attack on the bandits. The bandits stubbornly resisted by relying on the dangerous terrain, but after three hours, they were finally unable to hold out. Our army occupied Tawo at Weishi hour (1-3 PM). In this battle, over one hundred bandits were killed, dozens of bandits were captured, as well as Gui Nanxi, the sham Minister of Grain, and a large number of guns and ammunition were seized, along with dozens of loads of other equipment and luggage. More than one hundred hostages were rescued, and each was given five jiao of silver and two sheng of rice and sent back to their hometowns. The recovered area is now being handled with post-war measures, and teams have been sent to continue the pursuit and suppression. (11th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Xu Tingyao Discusses the Situation in Sichuan</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Xu Tingyao said that the situation in Sichuan was very good when he left, and the remnant bandits who had crossed the Jialing River had been repelled. He anticipated that they would be cleared up in a considerable amount of time. Chairman Chiang went to Guiyang to oversee the situation, and the period for his return to Chongqing has not yet been determined. Xu and others had been to Chengdu once. The city walls are magnificent, the area is peaceful, and the people are hard-working and enduring, getting up early and going to bed early, showing a strong sense of revitalization. Chongqing is a large metropolis, and its streets and houses are clean and magnificent, even surpassing Nanjing. In the past, the money and grain in various defense areas had even been pre-collected up to the 70th year of the Republic (1981). The people, unable to resist the forced payment, abandoned their homes and moved away, posting their land deeds on the door. Whoever could pay back the money and grain could take down the original deed and accept the property rights. After Chairman Chiang arrived in Sichuan, he began to rectify this situation, and this trend is gradually being eliminated. (11th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>The Puppet State's Petroleum Monopoly; Japan Replies to the United States; American Inspection Group Meets with Japanese Businessmen</h3>

Japan submitted its response to the third protest from the United States regarding this issue, which was submitted on November 30 of last year. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs handed over the reply to the American Ambassador to Japan on the tenth. The content is the same as the reply to England on March 25. (Eleventh day Rengo dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The third discussion between the American Far East Business Inspection Group and powerful Japanese businessmen was held at the Industry Club starting at ten o'clock on the morning of the eleventh. As with the previous two sessions, it was divided into three parts for discussion. The finance and economics section only exchanged opinions due to the absence of Mr. Forbes, the American chairman. In the tariffs and trade section, after discussing the current state of imports and exports between Japan and the United States, the Japanese side stated that the American government has adopted a policy of suppressing Japanese exports, such as cotton fabrics, matches, canned fish and meat, stationery, rubber, and pencils. The feeling is quite strong, but the above commodities are not of major importance to the United States itself, so it is requested that the means of preventing imports be eased. At the same time, regarding the so-called issue of large-scale dumping, the actual situation was explained in detail. The reason why Japanese goods are cheap is that labor costs are low, so the price of their products is very low. Moreover, apart from the labor production conditions, it is the result of efforts to recover from the recession in recent years, arising from rationalization. After explaining the above situation, it was requested that it be understood. In the transportation and shipping section, Mr. Nagashima, the passenger section chief of the postal shipping company, and Mr. Takaku, the director of the tourism bureau, were invited to listen to opinions on tourism affairs, and they expressed a consensus of opinion on promoting tourism between the two countries. Next, regarding the reduction of telegraphic fees between Japan and the United States, it was decided to strive for its realization. After the resolution, the meeting adjourned at noon. The group then attended a luncheon hosted by Baron Iwasaki. (Eleventh day Rengo dispatch)</p>

<h3>Mourning the Death of Mr. Ochs, Owner of the New York Times</h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>According to American dispatches, Mr. Ochs, the owner of the New York Times, passed away on the eighth at the age of seventy-seven. As a fellow member of the industry, I cannot help but express my condolences for the passing of this pioneer in the newspaper industry. Moreover, Mr. Ochs, as a son, relied on his strong and indomitable will, his spirit of self-improvement and tireless efforts to achieve this great achievement, which is a good model for the youth of our country. Therefore, I cannot but express my admiration for the success of Mr. Ochs.</p>
<p>Mr. Ochs only received elementary school education in his youth. He first entered the newspaper industry as a delivery boy, then became a typesetter. At the age of nineteen, he became the assistant editor of a local newspaper. At the age of twenty, he ran a directory in Chattanooga City and made a considerable profit. Later, he bought the Chattanooga Times, which was the beginning of Mr. Ochs' newspaper business. At the age of thirty-eight, he bought the New York Times. At that time, the newspaper's circulation was only about 20,000 copies, and it employed only a little over one hundred people. The income did not cover the expenses, and it was a newspaper that had been losing money for years. However, since Mr. Ochs took over the business, the business has progressed day by day, and its position has become more and more elevated. Until recently, the New York Times became famous in the world, and its reputation is comparable to that of the London Times. As for its circulation, it reaches 400,000 copies on weekdays and 700,000 copies on Sundays. The number of employees has increased to more than 3,000, and the annual income has increased to more than 15 million US dollars. What others failed to run successfully flourished in the hands of Mr. Ochs. If he did not have extraordinary talent and wisdom, how could he have achieved this?</p>
<p>Although the reason why the New York Times has become a great newspaper in the world is not in its large circulation. The New York Times' circulation is only 400,000 copies on weekdays and only 700,000 copies on Sundays. In advanced European and American countries, this number cannot be said to be large. For example, the American Daily News has a circulation of one million copies, and the Chicago Tribune also has more than 800,000 copies. The English Daily Herald has a circulation of more than two million copies, and The People has more than three million copies, all of which are far more than the New York Times. However, when people talk about newspapers, they recommend the London Times in England and the New York Times in the United States. Why? The reason is due to the different quality of the newspapers. Those who focus solely on circulation often pay attention to general interests to cater to the tastes of general readers, while often neglecting the enrichment of news content, the analysis of current affairs issues, and the introduction of various knowledge. Therefore, although the circulation of the newspaper is large, its function in society and the country is not as good as that of a newspaper with a smaller circulation but a higher style. Therefore, the reason why a great newspaper is a great newspaper is not necessarily in the large number of copies published daily, but in the quality and content being rich and rigorous. On this point, both the English Times and the American New York Times can be worthy of it.</p>
<p>When we look at the content of the New York Times, we know that the success of Mr. Ochs in running the newspaper is by no means accidental. As far as we can see, the characteristics of the New York Times can be roughly described as follows: (1) The use of wireless telegraphy. With this equipment, the coverage of any news at home and abroad can be quick and unaffected. (2) The New York Times' correspondents are not only all over the country, but also all over the world. Therefore, no matter where news occurs, it can be sent by the correspondents through wireless electricity without any omissions. (3) The domestic and foreign correspondents hired by the New York Times are all experts who are well-versed in the research of a certain issue. Therefore, the telegrams they send not only report news, but can also narrate this issue in a systematic manner. The so-called telegrams are actually like a thorough thesis. (4) Ordinary newspaper readers often have difficulty understanding the recent political, social, and economic issues. The New York Times specially hires experts to analyze them in detail in extremely simple language to make them clear to readers at a glance. (5) International news readers often do not pay much attention to it, which is a common problem for people from all countries. The reason for this is the lack of understanding of foreign affairs, and the lack of interest in reading international news due to this lack of understanding. Mr. Ochs knows the reason and specially invites experts to write special articles in the Sunday supplements to explain each international issue in detail. There must be one or twenty such articles every week, which are indispensable reading materials for understanding the general trend of the world and the political situation of various countries. Although the London Times also pays attention to international news, it has never paid attention to this kind of explanation work. This is why the New York Times has a unique characteristic.</p>
<p>Therefore, I deeply feel that the success of Mr. Ochs is by no means accidental, but the result of his extraordinary talent and vision. With the difficulties he encountered in his early years and the shallowness of his education, he was able to develop his innate potential through his own efforts to achieve this great achievement, which cannot but make people yearn for it.</p>
<h3>Borromean Palace; Three-Nation Conference Opens; Five Powerful Diplomats Gathered in One Room; Discussing the Work of Appeasing Europe Together</h3>
<p>Stresa The magnificent Borromean Palace, a 17th-century ancient building on Bella Island in Lake Maggiore, is the focus of worldwide attention today. The leaders of the three most powerful countries in Europe, Britain, France and Italy, are gathered here to discuss the issue of appeasing Europe. At eleven o'clock this morning, the five most capable diplomats in Europe, namely MacDonald and Simon of England, Flandin and Laval of France, and Mussolini of Italy, sat around the ancient palace music room with its colorful program, and began their important meeting. While the meeting was in progress, only a limited number of officials were allowed to attend the island, so the details of the discussion will not be known until the representatives return to Stresa tonight.</p>
<p>Yesterday morning and afternoon group meetings It is only heard that before lunch, the British representatives fully stated the results of Simon's visit to Berlin and Eden's visit to Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague.</p>
<p>The morning meeting was temporarily suspended at 1:30 pm, and the Italian government held a banquet in the palace to entertain the guests, a total of forty people. Subsequently, the representatives strolled around the island and paid tribute to the tomb of General Cadrona, the commander-in-chief of the Italian army during the European War. The afternoon meeting began at five o'clock, discussing France's complaint to the League of Nations regarding Germany's rearmament.</p>
<p>Italian Prime Minister Drafts Agenda It was previously rumored that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini would propose a practical plan for European peace at the meeting. Now it is learned that Mussolini will temporarily specialize in drafting the meeting agenda, which contains:</p>
<p>(1) Thorough study of the European situation caused by Germany's implementation of compulsory military service.</p>
<p>(2) The impact of British Cabinet members' visits to several European capitals and the London Gazette of February 3.</p>
<p>(3) Possible concessions on the armaments of Hungary, Austria, and Bulgaria.</p>
<p>The arrival of the three prime ministers Stresa Italian Prime Minister Mussolini first arrived here by a three-engine plane from Rome and landed on the lake. At 10:30 that night, French Prime Minister Flandin and Foreign Minister Laval also followed. Mussolini personally welcomed them at the station, where a military band played the Marseillaise. (Eleventh day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Stresa British Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon arrived here at 8:45 this morning, the last of the three-nation representatives to arrive. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich welcomed them at the station. When the train carrying the British delegation entered the station, the Italian military band played the British national anthem "God Save the King." Italian Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Grandi, also arrived with the British delegation in the same car. The British delegation then drove to the hotel to rest briefly, and soon took a steamer across the lake to Bella Island. The three-nation conference then opened at eleven o'clock. The future of the meeting is still difficult to predict, but it will undoubtedly focus on the Franco-Russian agreement. (Eleventh day Guomin dispatch)</p>
<p>Military and police armed with strict precautions The Italian authorities have taken extremely strict precautions to ensure the safety of the representatives. The borders, railways, and avenues through which the representatives passed were all guarded by military and police, and machine guns were placed in several places. French Prime Minister Flandin happened to take a walk outside his hotel this morning and suddenly saw twenty plainclothes people following him, so he returned to the hotel immediately (Eleventh day Reuters dispatch) Stresa Mussolini will reside on the small island of Isola Bella near Stresa, where there is a palace that will be used as Mussolini's headquarters. The island is now heavily guarded by the Panzies army, and special passes are required to go ashore and leave the island. The small island of Stresa is now crowded with journalists from all over the world, and rumors are rife. However, the Stresa conference is probably just a preparatory meeting before the meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council on the 15th, which will decide to convene an expanded conference and invite Germany, Soviet Russia, and the Little Entente countries to participate together.

<p>British Prime Minister's Declaration Before Leaving the Country (London) This afternoon, Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Minister Simon departed by plane to Stresa. Before boarding the plane, the Prime Minister issued a statement, saying, "Promoting sincere cooperation between countries in order to achieve joint security and establish peace is the task we have undertaken. I sincerely hope that this task will be successful, and we will strive to make it successful," and so on. (Eleventh day Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>France's Bag Contains an Agreement Stresa There is no definite news on what suggestions will be made during the meeting, but many believe that France's Angriff Newspaper in Berlin discussed the new agreement between France and Russia, saying that France went to Stresa with an agreement in its bag, and also carried several military agreements with the Little Entente countries, Turkey, and Greece, hoping to induce hesitant Britain to join the agreement system.

<p>The United States Considers Strictly Maintaining Neutrality (Washington) While British, French, and Italian politicians are gathered in Stresa to solve the European crisis, President Roosevelt is here today consulting with Secretary of State Hull on the ways for the United States to strictly maintain neutrality.

<h3>Italy's Only Plan; Armed Guarantee of Peace; Does Not Want to Establish a Camp Against Germany; An Article in the Minbao Reveals Mussolini's Handwriting</h3>
<p>Stresa Today's Italian Minbao published an article that revealed Mussolini's handwriting, which stated that Italy must still maintain an army of 600,000 people, equipped with the latest weapons, so that the joint air force and navy can guarantee peace because of the dark clouds over Europe. The article also mentioned the possibility of holding another international conference in the near future, including Germany, Russia, and Poland, which did not attend the Stresa Conference. The article has aroused great attention in diplomatic circles, as it implies that Italy will seek cooperation with Germany again, and does not want to establish a camp against Germany at the Stresa Conference. (Eleventh day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>Milan The Italian Minbao published an article today with the title "Our Plan," which everyone believes was undoubtedly written by Mussolini. This article warned readers to not be optimistic during the Stresa Conference, but said that the Stresa Conference will not lead to war, nor will it achieve permanent peace, because the center of peace is in a country outside the conference. The Stresa Conference will discuss many fundamental issues regarding Germany, Russia, and Poland, which did not attend the conference. Things in Eastern Europe are in a state of flux, so the so-called Italian plan is roughly as follows: Italy will maintain a large army of 600,000 people, equip them with the latest weapons, and will enrich the air force and navy to wait for the situation to clear up.

<h3>Berlin Clarifies its Attitude; Willing to Participate in Cooperation Based on Equality</h3>
<p>Stresa Berlin Reuters Dispatch stated that the political circles are now trying to clarify Germany's current attitude towards the European appeasement issue, which is more positive than what was expressed after the British visit to Berlin, and said that the League of Nations must make many changes before it can replace Europe's enthusiasm for covenants and become a powerful organization. Germany wants to see a lasting solution to the European appeasement issue, and if any hope of a new spirit of peace and cooperation based on equality descends on Geneva, then the meeting of the League of Nations Executive Council to be held on April 15 should hint at this point. The League of Nations has an opportunity in the future, hoping that it will recognize and use it. (Tenth day Reuters dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) German political figures believe that the Stresa Conference may not be effective, saying that only a conference with German representatives can produce results. Also, British Foreign Secretary Simon issued a declaration in the Lower House, strongly stating that the British opinion is different from that of Germany, and expressed a neutral or pleasant attitude towards the security system planned by France and Italy. German political figures were quite displeased upon hearing this. Political figures are now anxious about two things: one is the Franco-Russian agreement, and the other is the attitude of Britain and Italy towards France's application to the League of Nations Executive Council. (Eleventh day Havas dispatch)</p>
<p>(Berlin) As the Stresa Conference opens, all of Europe's eyes are focused on it. The outcome of the conference has become the subject of speculation for the German newspapers, and some newspapers quite approve of the declaration of the British Foreign Secretary Simon in the Lower House, because from Simon's words, it can be inferred that Britain will still pursue the exploration policy that it has been pursuing for several weeks in the Stresa Conference, because after the British ambassador visited various capitals, he has learned which treaties are more likely to succeed.

<h3>Franco-Russian Agreement Impresses Britain, Leading to a Change in Planned Strategy to Expand into a Universal Convention</h3>
<p>(London) News today that France and Soviet Russia are about to form a military alliance has led the British government to temporarily change its plans for participating in the Stresa Conference. Before Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon departed, the cabinet convened an emergency meeting to decide on this change. Reportedly, after hearing about the Franco-Russian alliance, Britain decided to find ways to have France expand its agreement with Russia into a universal European security pact, or to conclude other conventions outside the Franco-Russian agreement, so that Germany would join. Before the cabinet meeting, Foreign Secretary Simon had a lengthy meeting with the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Bingham. Simon repeatedly explained the situation for President Roosevelt's reference. Simon said that Britain did not want to make any new representations at the Stresa Conference, as the conference was purely exploratory. A member of the French delegation, traveling by train to Stresa, stated en route that Britain's plan might have a chance of gaining French approval. If Germany continues to refuse to join the League of Nations, then the new Franco-Russian plan contains a mutual assistance pact to protect Europe against Germany. The representative further clearly stated that, in the opinion of the French, the withdrawal of any country from the League of Nations necessitates that other loyal member states re-determine their position, and that measures should be taken to defend against the threat of non-member states. The remarks of the French representative can be seen as an attempt to make the proposed Franco-Russian agreement part of a collective security system within the framework of the League of Nations, rather than a military alliance against any country. (10th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Views of British Diplomatic Circles (London) The favorable impression of the Franco-Russian agreement in Britain is becoming more and more evident. Tonight, British diplomatic circles have expressed this very clearly. According to diplomatic sources, the Franco-Russian agreement clearly stipulates that it is based on the Covenant of the League of Nations, and its position is solid and unshakeable. Both theoretically and practically, it is welcomed by British public opinion. Not only that, but British diplomatic circles have also raised a question: whether this type of agreement can be discussed at the Stresa Conference, so as to expand it to the whole of Europe. In the opinion of diplomatic circles, it is most appropriate to use this method to make a precise interpretation of the Covenant of the League of Nations within a prescribed area. If the Covenant of the League of Nations is to be amended, it must be approved by all member states. This method does not require amending the Covenant, and its effect is exactly the same, and some member states will not raise objections. It is the best of both worlds. Diplomatic sources also raised a question: whether Britain has the possibility of participating in such conventions in accordance with the outline of the Franco-Russian agreement. Although this cannot be determined at present, it is expected that if the United States decides to participate in such conventions, the British Dominions will not raise objections, because the scope of application of such conventions is limited to Europe, and its nature is the same as the Locarno Treaty, and the Dominions may not be bound by any restrictions. In addition, it is noteworthy that Foreign Secretary Simon made a statement in the House of Commons yesterday, saying that British cabinet members will not accept any constraints at the Stresa Conference without the consent of Parliament. Although the Foreign Secretary made this statement, the British representatives at the Stresa Conference may still reach some kind of agreement in principle with the French and Italian representatives. As for the (Continued on Page 7)</p>
<h2>Page 7</h2>
<p>realization of this principle, it is also possible to make a decision after discussing it with Parliament in the future. These are the views expressed by British diplomatic circles. Although it is not appropriate to speculate on what kind of attitude MacDonald and Simon will take at the Stresa Conference based on these views, it is safe to say that these views are worthy of attention. (10th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>No Less Than a Public Military Alliance (Paris) The French press is very quiet about the recent Franco-Russian agreement. The government is doing its best to deny that this agreement is a prelude to a military alliance between the two countries, but the News opposes this view, saying that the Franco-Russian agreement is undoubtedly equivalent to a public alliance, and the meaning of this alliance is war. However, officials insist that the general idea of the agreement is only to explain the general principles of the League of Nations Covenant, and the terms established are only an outline, and how to implement them will have to be determined in the future. The first article of the agreement is a preamble, which defines the 10th, 16th and 17th articles of the League of Nations Covenant, and the second section of the 10th article, that is, the steps to be taken for military sanctions against an aggressor country that is unwilling to abide by the League of Nations Covenant and launches a war, is also specifically discussed. The second article of the agreement stipulates that disputes that do not need to be intervened immediately, and the third article, the last article, is based on the provisions of the first section of the 16th article of the League of Nations Covenant, and stipulates the actions to be taken against unscrupulous aggressors.

<h3>British Policy Secrets: U.S. Ambassador to Britain Reports to the President</h3>
<p>(Washington) After meeting with British Foreign Secretary Simon, the U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Bingham, today sent a secret report to President Roosevelt on the British policy for the Stresa Conference. (11th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>British and Italian Views Clearly Differ</h3>
<p>Stresa British Foreign Secretary Simon's statement in the House of Commons yesterday, although revealing something about Britain's diplomatic attitude, was not very clear. What attitude will the British delegation take at the Stresa Conference? Italian people are still very concerned about this. British people all say that Prime Minister MacDonald and Foreign Secretary Simon came to Stresa without any plans. The British believe that the Stresa Conference, in addition to having the nature of gathering information, should first decide on a major issue, that is, whether it is still possible for Britain, France and Italy to cooperate directly with Germany. If Britain, France and Italy reach a common position on this major issue, then all other issues can be easily resolved. However, the Italian point of view is different. Italy believes that the most important issue at present is to decide on a common attitude among Britain, France and Italy. This common attitude does not mean opposing Germany, but is only used to deal with Germany's unilateral abolition of the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles. All plans concerning Europe should not be considered until this urgent issue is resolved. From this, it can be seen that there are obvious differences between British and Italian views, but the British believe that this difference is only a difference in method, and there is no difference in fundamental views, and that the British delegation, under the leadership of MacDonald, has now decided to discuss all issues of the Stresa Conference in a frank and sincere spirit.

Also, the newspapers here pay little attention to the Stresa Conference.

<h3>Famous Russian Political Commentator Exposes German Ambition</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Germany is celebrating the 70th birthday of General Ludendorff, the first Quartermaster General of the former German Imperial Army. A famous Soviet political commentator commented on the ambition of the German Imperial Army to encompass the world from Hamburg to Baghdad and from Finland to the Adriatic Sea, saying, "Now, when the German fascist government is announcing to the world the reconstruction of its army and the implementation of universal military service, it always uses Ludendorff as its banner. This point also proves that the policy of fascist Germany is only a continuation of the policy of German imperialism that was destroyed by the Great War. If there are still people who do not know and continue to discuss the purpose of German fascism, then no one in the world is ignorant of the purpose of German imperialism in the past."

<h3>Japan Watches from Afar: Oriental Newspaper Urges Government to Fully Prepare to Prevent European Turmoil from Spreading to East Asia</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Tokyo newspapers are generally skeptical of the Stresa Conference. The Jiji Shinpo says that the outcome of the conference is still uncertain, and it is feared that Germany's rearmament will make the future of disarmament more chaotic. The newspaper also hopes that the Japanese government will fully prepare to prevent European turmoil from spreading to East Asia, as the issue of Germany's former colonies may cause turmoil. The newspaper concludes by saying that Japan has decided to retain the islands entrusted to it under mandate. (11th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<h3>British and French Defense Still Based on Battleships: Aerial Bombardment Has Not Rendered Them Ineffective; Lessons Learned from the Greek Rebellion</h3>
<p>(London) British Secretary of the Navy Monsell said today in a speech at the Society of Naval Architects that the recent rebellion in Greece and the large-scale experiments in the United States have shown that aerial bombardment has not rendered battleships ineffective. The experience of the old Greek cruiser Averoff is worth learning from. The ship has no deck protection, only two old-fashioned three-time caliber anti-aircraft guns, but it can freely enter and exit and move as it pleases, without being troubled by the pursuit of new aircraft. Old-fashioned battleships can still resist aerial attacks, so future battleships will definitely be bastions in national defense. Navy personnel all hold this view. According to a naval reporter for the Daily Telegraph, French naval authorities have recently decided that the future French fleet will be based on battleships, which is contrary to the previous emphasis on submarines and light ships.

<h3>U.S. Raises Silver Prices Again: Domestic Newly Mined Silver at 71 Cents per Ounce</h3>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has decided that the purchase price of domestically produced new silver should be increased from 64.5 cents per ounce to 71 cents, and will be implemented from today. However, the silver coin minting tax will be reduced from 50 cents to 45 cents. It is generally believed that the increase in domestic silver prices is mostly due to speculation in the London market. After the increase in silver prices, the U.S. government will need to increase its expenses by more than 100 million yuan due to the implementation of the Silver Purchase Act. According to the current foreign silver price, it is between 64.37 and 64.5 cents. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau said that if the foreign silver price rises to 64.5 cents or more, the government will raise the domestic silver price. After this statement was issued, the silver price on the Montreal Exchange in Canada rose to 65.1 to 65.5 cents. (10th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) After meeting with President Roosevelt, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated that the United States will cope with any silver price in the world market. Currently, the world silver price is about 46.5 cents per ounce. If the price rises, the United States will also raise the silver price. This morning, President Roosevelt met with reporters and did not criticize the proposal for a new silver bill, but said that if the world silver price exceeds 64.5 cents, silver miners in the United States will be able to get a higher price. Senator Thomas stated that Morgenthau's announcement is in line with the provisions of the Silver Purchase Act, which stipulates that the Treasury Department must cope with the world silver price. The Treasury Secretary's words can encourage the use of silver. Progress can be expected by proceeding in this way. Those in the Treasury Department who are not sympathetic to the silver program are ordering the silver price to fall, but silver-backed congressmen have always insisted on their demand to raise the silver price. After the Treasury Secretary spoke, it was reported that the selling price on Wall Street in New York was 64.75 cents. This statement was not initially confirmed, but according to later news, the silver price had indeed risen, and transactions were concluded at a price of 65 cents. The final price was 64.625 cents. It is reported that the number of transactions was between 300,000 and 500,000 ounces. The financial community is paying close attention to silver. Members of the Congressional Silver Committee are very satisfied with Morgenthau's announcement. Because the world silver price is already high, domestic silver producers will be unwilling to sell their ore to the Treasury Department at the current statutory price. This afternoon, President Roosevelt increased the price at which the Treasury Department buys domestic ore from 64.5 cents per ounce to 71 cents, effective from today. As a result, the price of newly mined silver in the United States suddenly rose by 6.5 cents. (10th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) It is estimated that since the silver price that the Treasury Department has to pay has increased, the country must pay more than 100 million yuan to fulfill the provisions of the Silver Purchase Act. According to Treasury Department officials, this case will eventually require the government to buy silver worth 950,967,000 yuan. The reason for the Treasury Department's purchase price of 71 cents per ounce of ore is that the minting tax has been reduced from 50 cents to 45 cents. Based on the current gold supply of 8,599,743,000 yuan, the silver that must be purchased under the Silver Purchase Act should have a value of 2,866,580,000 yuan in the treasury in order to meet the ratio of gold 75 and silver 25. The Treasury Department's current silver holdings are only worth 915,614,000 yuan. (10th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) Officials here believe that President Roosevelt's decision today to increase the silver purchase price from 64.5 cents to 71 cents indicates that the U.S. government is more actively pursuing the silver policy than before. Public opinion generally believes that this move shows that the government will continue to implement its policy of hoarding a large amount of silver reserves. The price of one ounce of silver, which is advocated by the silver faction, must be worth one yuan and 29 cents, is now one step further. According to the opinion of many experts, the immediate impact of the United States raising silver prices will be a continued increase in the world silver price. Some observers believe that the authorities' move is at least partly due to the pressure of the congressional silver faction, which has been campaigning to raise silver prices for a long time. (10th Reuters News Agency Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) U.S. silver policy is now the focus of general attention again. According to silver market brokers, it is only a matter of time before the world silver price follows the high U.S. domestic price. When the world silver price rises, the U.S. authorities will raise the domestic price again until the silver faction's dream of a silver price of 1.29 yuan per ounce or a gold-silver ratio of 16 to 1 is realized in the future. The U.S. silver purchase policy still has some progress to be made. This is the key point for silver to look high. Silver market brokers and bankers point out that the U.S. behavior will make China's monetary difficulties more acute, because China's silver exports will be even greater. The News reported today that the United States is responsible for the continued rise in silver prices. U.S. leaders seem determined to destroy China's monetary standard. If the United States continues to pursue its goals regardless, then the only thing to do is to advise China to quickly establish a new monetary standard. People in the financial community have long anticipated President Roosevelt's decision to increase domestic silver prices, because since the world silver price has already risen, he obviously cannot offer a price higher abroad than at home. Since the pound has fallen and China's silver exports have also decreased, and the silver required by the United States under the Silver Purchase Act has increased greatly, the rise in silver prices seems inevitable. The world financial market may not be affected by this. As far as China is concerned, the only solution is to break away from silver and link it to other currencies. (11th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>France Minting Gold Coins</h3>
<p>(Paris) The government previously ordered the reminting of gold coins worth 200 francs each. The minting of these coins began today. Treasury Secretary Germain-Martin personally started the machine to melt and cast the first batch of gold coins. Many people from all walks of life attended the ceremony. Germain-Martin gave a speech, saying that the current international situation allows gold coins to re-circulate in the market, and the stability of the French currency is the starting point for restoring prosperity, so that the French people can all benefit from it, because the soundest foundation for prices can only be established after economic reorganization, and so on. The minting of gold coins will now be accelerated. By 1936, the mint will be able to mint 1.5 billion francs per year. (10th Havas Telegram)</p>

Many parties predict that if the government does not have a concrete announcement regarding cotton farmers' loans, cotton prices will fall further. Not long after the opening, there was a rumor that the government would announce cotton loan measures within this week. Although this news was not of a constructive nature, it has eliminated a lot of uncertainty. It is believed that this is the result of repeated protests from Washington against the handling fee. There are different opinions on what impact the government's announcement will have. Some parties say that President Roosevelt's statement yesterday that the funding for the Public Works Administration cannot be used for agriculture has indicated that the government does not want to cancel the handling fee. However, there are also optimists who believe that the handling fee can eventually be canceled. When the cotton market opened, foreign parties rushed to buy, and the shorts also rushed to cover, causing the price per bale to rise by about 1.25 points.

However, there are no mechanical repair shops within the puppet territory, which causes various inconveniences regarding the use and sale of goods. Thus, the invasion of Japanese industrial products in the Northeast has become a crucial issue. Therefore, to meet the needs of the North, Mitsubishi Company has decided to establish a new company in the puppet state, centering on Shenyang. The new company will first focus on repair shops to increase its invasion and monopolization efforts. The new company is reportedly jointly funded by Mitsubishi Industrial, Mitsubishi Electric, Mitsubishi Trading, and other three companies. The construction of the repair shop is currently underway and is expected to be completed within the year. General observations suggest that the completion of this shop and the new company will bring about significant changes in the industrial and commercial sectors of the Northeast.

<h3>Tang Dynasty Buddha Statues Unearthed in Zichuan, Shandong: Exquisitely Carved with Brightly Colored Paintings, A Major Discovery in Ancient Painting</h3>
<p>Jinan Dispatch. In the northeastern corner of Zichuan County, Shandong Province, residents recently discovered twelve stone-carved Buddha statues while digging a well. They have now been transported to the county's People's Education Center for preservation. According to research, the site of the discovery is only a few steps away from Puzhao Temple. According to the county gazetteer, Puzhao Temple is the ancient Kaiyuan Temple. The temple still has a stone pillar with engraved scriptures, said to be written by Li Beihai. The Buddha statue in the hall is over two zhang high, hence the popular name Dafosi (Great Buddha Temple). Based on this, the stone Buddha should undoubtedly be the Buddha of the ancient Kaiyuan Temple. Unfortunately, among the twelve statues, only two heads with Buddhist halos remain, and the rest are missing their originals. Two more Buddha heads were later found, but they could not match the bodies of the various Buddhas. Archaeologists say that during the flourishing of Taoism in the Song Dynasty, many Buddha statues from the Tang Dynasty were destroyed, or their heads or arms were lost. Buddhist disciples often buried the Buddha statues underground to avoid the disaster. Among the statues, there are seven standing statues (two large and five small) and three sitting statues, all very small. There is also a stone-carved three-Buddha statue, among which the tallest statue is exquisitely carved and the gilding is still intact. One statue has the inscription "On the tenth day of the fourth month of the third year of Qianyuan, the disciple Wang Zilu made a statue of Bhaisajyaguru Buddha." The stone quality varies. One statue appears to be made of white marble from the Beijing area. The lower part is painted in very bright colors. Not many Buddha statues from the Tang Dynasty were painted, making this a major discovery in ancient painting. The remaining stone is made of bluestone and white stone. The County People's Education Center has now transported the statues to the center and preserved them together with the Han Dynasty stone carvings obtained last year for public viewing.

<h3>The Remaining Bandits of Jiangxi Province Can Be Eliminated in the Short Term; Bandit Core Military Force Almost Completely Annihilated</h3>
<p>Nanchang Airmail: After the main force of the Jiangxi bandits, the pseudo First, Third, Fifth, Eighth, and Ninth Army Corps, fled westward in early November of last year, the remaining bandits in Jiangxi Province totaled about 30,000 people with over 16,000 firearms. Under the leadership of bandit chiefs Xiang Ying and Chen Yi, they organized a pseudo-Central Office and a pseudo-Central Military Region in southern Jiangxi to command all operations. The Northern Route Headquarters of the bandit suppression army was reorganized in early December of last year and established as the Jiangxi Pacification Commissioner's Office, continuing to undertake the pacification work in Jiangxi Province. They commanded the troops stationed in Jiangxi, dividing them into eight pacification zones, each equipped with a sufficient military force, actively engaged in search and suppression. Thanks to the brave efforts of the officers and soldiers, significant progress has been made in suppressing the bandits. From December of last year to the end of March this year, important bandit groups, such as the pseudo-24th Division of the pseudo-Central Military Region in southern Jiangxi and the independent regiments of Zeng Shan's unit, as well as Fang Zhimin's unit in northeastern Jiangxi, were successively eliminated. The main force of the bandits has been almost completely wiped out. Currently, the larger bandit groups scattered in various locations include only Xu Yangan's group on the border of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi provinces, and the pseudo-10th, 12th, 17th, 18th, and 19th regiments on the border of Fujian and Jiangxi provinces. Together with scattered remnants in various places, there are still about 10,000 people with approximately 8,000 to 9,000 firearms. It is estimated that all of them can be completely eliminated by the end of May this year. The Central News Agency reporter has learned the following details of the suppression situation in the past four months from relevant sources:</p>
<p>Southern Jiangxi Region: (A) In the area west of the Duhuai-Chang Xunwu line, after the joint suppression by our reserve army divisions and Yu Hanmou's troops, approximately 6,000 to 7,000 bandits with firearms from the pseudo-Central Military Region's 24th Division and various independent regiment guerrillas were repeatedly defeated from February 28th to March 7th. The bandits scattered and fled. In addition to the 8th Division killing He Chang, a pseudo-Central Committee member and director of the political department of the Central Military Region, Yang Ying, political commissar of the pseudo-24th Division, and Luo Zhansai, secretary-general of the pseudo-Central Military Region, our troops captured over 3,800 bandit officers and soldiers, including Xie Ranzhi, secretary-general of the pseudo-Central Government and editor-in-chief of the Red China News, regimental commander Li Jibin, Zhao Wanzhong, finance minister of the Southern Jiangxi Military Region, and guerrilla commander Li Haizhen. We also seized over 1,300 rifles and pistols, 29 light and heavy machine guns, and 24 handguns. Yu Hanmou's troops also captured approximately 2,000 bandit officers and soldiers, including Liu Bojian, director of the political department of the pseudo-Southern Jiangxi Military Region. We also seized over 1,100 rifles and pistols, over ten light and heavy machine guns, and one radio. The scattered remnants in this area are still being searched and suppressed. (B) In the area north of the Xingguo-Gulonggang line, our Fan (Songfu) Column began building blockhouses from February 15th, gradually searching and suppressing the area until March 6th. The pseudo-Independent 13th Regiment and various independent battalion guerrillas were gradually captured and killed. In addition to those killed, we captured over 1,200 bandit officers and soldiers, including Xie Xianxian, pseudo-chairman of the Victory County under the Central Committee and Jiangxi Provincial Committee, Xie Mingren, pseudo-Central Committee member and secretary of the Gonglue Wantai Special Committee of the Jiangxi Provincial Committee, Chen Shiming, commander of the pseudo-13th Regiment, Xu Dajiang, guerrilla commander of the pseudo-Gonglue Wantai, and various pseudo-battalion and company commanders, chairmen, and political commissars. We also seized over 800 rifles and pistols, six light and heavy machine guns, and one radio. The bandits in the area north of the Xinggu line were unable to gain a foothold. Zeng Shan, the former deputy chairman of the pseudo-Jiangxi Province, led approximately 1,000 people from the pseudo-Independent 2nd and 4th Regiments with 800 to 900 firearms, and desperately broke through to the north on March 8th. Our troops pursued and suppressed them along various routes. As of the end of March, we killed over 400 bandits in the Fuyong-Xueshiqiao-Guxian-Dingmaoshan area south of Yongfeng, and in the Liuyuan-Mabu area north of Yongfeng. We captured over 570 bandits, including Hua Tianbao, commander of the pseudo-Independent 4th Regiment. We also seized over 400 rifles and pistols, 16 light and heavy machine guns, and 13 handguns. Over 200 remaining bandits scattered and fled. Bandit leader Zeng Shan disguised himself and escaped, and is currently being searched and suppressed in various areas. (C) In the central area of Yudu, Ruijin, and Huichang, the garrison troops searched and suppressed the area. In addition to Zhu Feizi, director-general and political commissar of the pseudo-Central Health Department Hospital, who was killed by our troops, we captured over 2,300 various bandits (approximately one-third of whom were wounded or ill), and over 300 rifles. On March 6th, our □□ marshal unearthed over 20 telephone switchboards and over 110 table telephones in Meikeng, 20 miles west of Ruijin. On March 9th, in the Gangmianxu area, approximately 40 miles northwest of Ruijin, we unearthed over 8,000 rifles, over 200 light and heavy machine guns, over ten artillery barrels, and over 700 bayonets. We also unearthed a silver-melting machine, a rolling machine, a blocking machine, and a printing machine in Longshan, approximately ten miles south. We also found over 30 mortars and 124 mortar base plates. Near Gaobo, over ten miles northwest of Gangmianxu, we found 23 boxes of books from the pseudo-Central Library, as well as over 200 dan (a unit of weight) of steel blocks, tin blocks, and shell casings. It is clear that the 24th Division of the pseudo-Central Military Region and the pseudo-13th Regiment of the Southern Jiangxi Military Region were the core military force of the bandits in southern Jiangxi. After this force was eliminated, the major problem has been removed. The remaining scattered bandits can definitely be completely annihilated in the short term.</p>
<p>Northeastern Jiangxi Region: The bandit Fang Zhimin had been entrenched in the area bordering northeastern Jiangxi and the provinces of Zhejiang and Anhui for seven or eight years. In October of last year, the pseudo-7th Army Corps led by bandit Xun Weizhou fled from southern Jiangxi to the Hengfeng-Dexing area of northeastern Jiangxi, joining forces with Fang's unit, greatly increasing their strength. They reorganized all the bandits into the 10th Army Corps, commanding the pseudo-19th, 20th, 21st, and 3rd divisions, totaling over 8,000 people with approximately 3,000 rifles and pistols and over 50 machine guns. In January of this year, our pursuing and suppressing troops, the 49th Division under Wu Chengren, the 21st Brigade under Li Wenbin, and the 1st Supplementary Brigade under Wang Yaowu, led by Yu Jishi, relentlessly pursued the bandits. Our Zhao Guantao unit and other troops blocked and suppressed them from all sides. From January 5th to 21st, the bandits were defeated and almost completely annihilated in the area of Wuyuan, Kaihua, and Yushan. In addition to those killed, over 5,000 bandits were captured, and over 2,000 firearms and one radio were seized. No important bandit leaders escaped. Xun Weizhou, commander of the pseudo-7th Army Corps, and Wang Yizhi, commander of the 20th Division, were killed in battle on the spot. Fang Zhimin, chairman of the pseudo-Fujian-Zhejiang-Jiangxi Provincial Soviet, Liu Taoxi, commander of the pseudo-10th Army Corps, Wang Ruichi, commander of the pseudo-10th Army, Hu Tiantao, commander of the 21st Division, Wang Ji, the newly appointed commander of the 19th Division, Zhou Qun, chief of the pseudo-Security Bureau, Li Shubin, political commissar, and Chen Shiming, Qiao Xin, and others, were successively captured near Huaiyu Mountain and Yuxie Peak on the border of Yushan and Dexing on January 28th and 29th, and are currently in custody.</p>
<p>Western Jiangxi Region: Chen Hongtan, Yu Bao and other bandit leaders of the pseudo-Hunan-Hubei Military Region leading the pseudo-Independent 2nd and 5th Regiments, with approximately 700 to 800 people and firearms, were suppressed by Commander Tan Daoyuan starting in January of this year. By mid-March, over 200 bandits had been killed and over 400 bandits had been captured in Lianhua County, Pingxiang. Over 400 firearms, five machine guns, and one radio were seized. The remaining bandits have now fled westward to the You-Li border area of Hunan Province. Troops have now been dispatched across the border to pursue and suppress them, and Chairman He of Hunan Province has been requested by telegram to send troops to intercept and block them. The date of elimination should not be far off.</p>
<p>Northwestern Jiangxi Region: Xu Yangan's unit, with approximately 3,000 people and over 2,000 firearms, had been entrenched in the border area of Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi for a long time. In January of this year, due to the transfer of troops in the area and the weakness of the military force, the bandits became rampant again. The Pacification Commissioner's Office transferred additional troops to southern Hubei in early February to participate in the suppression. The bandits were unable to gain a foothold and fled to Pingjiang, Hunan Province, on March 8th. By mid-March, they had fled to the Tongxiu area. Commanders Shan Tan and Chen have each dispatched troops to pursue and suppress them. The encirclement is complete, and it will not be difficult to annihilate them in one fell swoop.</p>
<p>Fujian-Jiangxi Border Region: The 12th, 17th, 18th, and 19th Regiments belonging to the pseudo-Fujian-Jiangxi Military Region, and Huang Ligui's gang, roamed between the Shicheng-Ruijin line and the counties of Ninghua, Jianning, and northern Fujian. The Pacification Commissioner's Office is currently planning to coordinate with the Fujian Provincial Pacification troops in a joint suppression. However, after Li Desheng, commander of the pseudo-Northern Fujian Military Region, surrendered, Huang Ligui's gang completely eliminated its pseudo-headquarters, radio station, hospital, and all organizations. The internal situation has become unstable. According to recent reports, Huang Ligui's gang, after being jointly suppressed by our troops, had nowhere to go. Due to the blockade and the interruption of supplies, they inserted bamboo sticks along the road near Nantang, Guangfeng County, intending to surrender. They also released ten hostages, including Yu Kejie, to show their determination. It is expected that they will lead their troops to surrender to Commander Liu in Pucheng within the month. In summary, since the four months that Jiangxi province's remaining bandit strength has been actively suppressed by our pacification troops, the number of eliminated people is about 12,000 and the number of firearms captured is about 8,000. The more than 8,000 rifles and over 200 machine guns dug up from the bandits' hiding places are not included in this total. At present, the areas of southern Jiangxi and northeastern Jiangxi have been declared pacified. Western Jiangxi, northwestern Jiangxi, and the Fujian-Jiangxi border area are also being actively suppressed. The current strength of the remaining bandits is estimated to be about 12,000 to 13,000 people with approximately 8,000 to 9,000 firearms. Compared to the beginning of December last year, this is more than half of the force that existed then has been eliminated. It is estimated that the are will be thoroughly pacified before the end of May of this year. (Central News Agency, April 8th)</p>
<h3>Anhui Province: An Overview of This Year's Construction - A Talk by Liu Yiyan -</h3>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: Liu Yiyan, Director of the Anhui Construction Department, after attending the Anhui Central Bandit Suppression Conference in Hefei, went to Beijing via Bengbu to discuss Anhui Province's construction projects for this year with the Economic Committee. Yesterday, he arrived in Wuhu from Beijing to attend the closing ceremony of the Wuhu-Tunxi Road Goods Exhibition, and then returned to Anqing via ferry. During his stay in Wuhu, he announced the following construction projects to be implemented in Anhui Province this year: (1) Highway Construction: During this trip to Beijing, he consulted with the Economic Committee. The road network in southern Anhui has been mostly completed. Although many important lines in northern Anhui have also been built, there are not enough resources to add pavement and build formal bridges for the time being. The proposed road construction plans for this year, including the Qiantai Road and the section of the Jing-Shaan Trunk Line passing through Anhui, were discussed with the Economic Committee. It was decided to first build the section of the Jing-Shaan Highway within Anhui Province. This road starts at Wujiang, passes through Hexian, Chaoxian, Hefei, Luan, Yejiaji, and then exits the province. Although the route is long, most of the earthwork has already been completed, and many temporary bridges and culverts have been built. Therefore, the progress of this road will be easier in the future. After returning to the province, construction will continue immediately. The Economic Committee will also provide full assistance to the road in order to complete it as soon as possible. (2) Seed Purchase and Cultivation: During this spring plowing season, seeds are crucial. Regarding the province's seed purchase loan, we initially requested a loan of 100,000 yuan from the Ministry of Finance. Later, the financial authorities decided to loan a total of 200,000 yuan to five provinces, which was too small to cope with. After Mr. Xu Shiying went to Shanghai to discuss with Finance Minister Kong, a final decision will be made. Improving sericulture is also a current priority. If the sericulture in Anhui Province is not urgently improved, it will be difficult to develop it. The Sericulture Improvement Committee of the National Economic Commission plans to allocate 100,000 mulberry seedlings, 20,000 silkworm egg sheets, and 2,000 yuan for banning inferior varieties. In the future, sericulture will be improved in accordance with the established guidelines, so as to gradually develop it. This is also the most important plan for rural revitalization. (3) Development of Production: Regarding the development of production, it is planned to implement the following points: 1. Promote industry and commerce to gradually revive them, such as the Wuhu-Tunxi Road Goods Exhibition, the National Goods Exhibition, and the National Goods Exhibition Hall. 2. The provincial agricultural and forestry institutions and the people must be integrated. In the past, the work of agricultural and forestry farms focused more on research and experimentation. In the future, it should be implemented more actively and not just talk about it. The production and construction conference held in the province this time is a prelude to striving to integrate with the people. 3. Establish a machine factory. Manufacturing in the machine field is currently lacking in the province. Therefore, we are preparing to establish a large-scale machine factory in the province to manufacture various agricultural tools and repair cars. (8th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: The Tax Police Regiment Opens and Garrison</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's Tax Police Regiment, formerly stationed in Haizhou, was recently ordered to transfer to Songjiang. Wen Yingxing, the commander of the regiment, specially sent staff officer Xie Minqiu to Songjiang to negotiate the location of the garrison. It is understood that the headquarters of the regiment is stationed in the former Viceroy Yamen. The platoon leader training center of the security office, originally stationed there, has been moved to the old site of the Tenth Factory outside the North Gate, which has been cleaned and refurbished today. The communications battalion of the tax police regiment, led by battalion commander Zhao Jikun, also opened and garrisoned in Songjiang yesterday, stationed in Xiaobeian. Commander Wen will arrive in Songjiang soon.</p>
<h3>Acceptance and Inspection of the City River Delayed, Causing Grievances</h3>
<p>The city river in Songjiang is silted up, which is inconvenient for people's drinking water and industrial and commercial transportation. Local people have repeatedly requested dredging. Last year, the county government organized a City River Dredging Committee to preside over the process. However, due to planning and funding issues, it was repeatedly opposed by local people. After dredging the Huayang East and Outer sections, the work was suspended. The remaining sections were planned to be dredged by the First District Office. After convening a meeting of the township heads, it was decided to dredge the sections to be dredged in six sections in order. The first section, from the East Gate to Guangming Bridge, was completed on the 20th of last month, and the county reported to the Provincial Construction Department to send personnel to inspect and accept it. However, more than half a month has passed. Although the provincial order has sent technician Gu Houxi to receive the inspection, after the document arrived, it has been four days and Gu has not been seen in Songjiang. As a result, the first phase of the project has not been inspected, and the second phase of the project cannot be started. Local people are quite alarmed because of drinking water and fire control.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Two Criminals in the Xianzishan Massacre Executed</h3>
<p>In the case of the Wang Cailin family in Xianzishan, outside Loumen, the whole family of three were murdered by bandits and their bodies were thrown into the river. The Water Police Detective Team arrested the murderers Gu Yunquan and Xu Shenggao and sent them to the local court. The interrogation confirmed the facts. Yesterday, the verdict was handed down. Gu Yunquan and Xu Shenggao were found guilty of premeditated murder, robbery, and injury, and were sentenced to death.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: A Night Boat to Qianhuang Was Robbed</h3>
<p>The night boat from this county to Qianhuang Town left Qianhuang loaded with goods at around 4 pm the day before yesterday and set sail for Wuxi. At around 9 pm, when passing through the Henghe River near Huangtang Bridge in the county, it was suddenly met by a pirate boat. Fifteen or sixteen bandits jumped out and ordered the boat to stop. They jumped onto the boat, holding short knives, wooden sticks and other weapons, and soaked silk cotton paper in oil, burned and illuminated it, and looted wantonly. Silver coins and clothes were stolen, with a total loss of more than 200 yuan. After getting the loot, the bandits jumped back to the original boat and rowed away.</p>
<h3>Changzhou: Opening of the Baozhang Training Institute</h3>
<p>Since Magistrate Hou of Wuyi County was ordered to handle the Baobaojia, the counties in the entire county have been completed one after another. Recently, a Baozhang Training Institute was organized, with Magistrate Hou serving as the director himself. The district Baozhang were ordered to be trained in two batches. The first batch was stipulated to be 1,000 people, and the opening ceremony was held at the Training Institute of Qingliang Temple today (the 11th). About 700 Baozhang reported, and the rest were limited to report to the office before the 14th. Their missed hours must still be made up. Wang Weifan, a representative from the Civil Affairs Department, came to Changzhou to deliver a speech. After the ceremony, classes began in the afternoon.</p>
<h3>Changshu: A Labor Dispute Occurs at the Litai Yarn Factory</h3>
<p>The Litai Yarn Factory in Zhitang is the only factory in this county. It is a joint venture established by wealthy merchants from Shanghai, Wuxi, and Changzhou. There are about 4,000 male and female workers. The daily output of yarn can reach more than 30 pieces. Recently, Zhu Jingan, the manager of the factory, believed that the cotton yarn market was depressed and the cost of cotton had increased, resulting in a huge loss. In order to maintain it permanently, the salaries of all employees and workers were paid at 80% of the original. This immediately caused the opposition of all the workers, who went on strike one after another. A representative, A Er, etc. were elected to petition the local district office and other places, requesting relief. Since the strike began on the 1st of this month, it has not been resolved as of the 8th. Then, the workers' representatives, together with associate manager Hong Xifu and district head Ping Chucai, went to Shanghai to contact manager Zhu Jingan in person. However, the market has been sluggish recently. According to manager Zhu, if the workers stop working, the factory can be closed. The district head believes that if the factory stops operating, four or five thousand workers will lose their jobs. Therefore, the purpose of the negotiation is to first focus on starting the factory machines and arranging workers, and then find other ways. This labor dispute is unlikely to escalate.</p>
<h3>Wujiang: A Tax Collector Flees and His Guarantor is Implicated</h3>
<p>Yan Xiuwen, the owner of the Dongxing Inn in Tongli Town, this county, is 48 years old. He is a very honest man and has a well to do family. He has been in business for many years and his business is doing well. His brother-in-law, Fan Shunlin, is a tax collector in Qidu, collecting and managing silk taxes. The amount of money he handles is not small. Unexpectedly, on January 20th of this year, he suddenly fled without a trace with a huge sum of money. Because Yan once served as his guarantor in the 21st year, the Wujiang County Government sent four or five staff members and bailiffs to the Dongxing Inn to arrest him on the afternoon of March 23rd. It happened that he was not there, so they detained the accountant Tao. On the afternoon of the 30th, the county government sent the section chief leading more than ten people to the residence again, guarded the front and back doors, and went straight to the bedroom for a thorough search. Even the neighbors were searched. The nearby residents were shocked and panicked when they saw this unexpected situation.</p>
<h3>Nantong: District Security Team Centralized Inspection</h3>
<p>The security teams of the six counties in the Nantong area are currently notified by the Fourth District Security Command that they will be concentrated in Nantong on the 17th and inspected by Xiang Zhizhuang, the director of the Provincial Security Office. The district security squad leader training class will also be extended to graduate on the 17th. Director Xiang will deliver a speech.</p>
<h3>Executing the Leader of the Jiangbei Sea Bandits</h3>
<p>Xie Weijun, the leader of the Jiangbei sea bandits, murdered his parents, uncle, and aunt in Guanyun last year, joined the bandit den, and rampaged on the rivers and seas. After being captured by the Water Police, he was escorted to the Nantong Commissioner's Office and tried by military law. Commissioner Zheng proposed the death penalty. The provincial telegram was approved on the 10th, and the bandit was escorted to the sacrificial altar execution ground and executed by shooting.</p>

<h3>City Government Yesterday Convened Various Preparatory Committees Establishment Meeting; Construction of Grand Auditorium in North and South City; Establishment of Health Clinics in Zhabei and Pudong; Crematorium Scheduled for Construction Within the Year</h3>
<p>The City Government convened the establishment meetings of the preparatory committees for the Zhabei Grand Auditorium, Nanshi Grand Auditorium, Crematorium, Pudong Health Clinic, and Zhabei Health Clinic at 11:30 AM yesterday (the 11th) in the City Government Conference Room. Attendees included Wang Bin-yan, Wu Xing-ya (represented by Zhang Bing-hui), Chen Bing-qian, Jiang Huai-su, Shen Lian-fang (represented by Wang Bin-yan), Liang Fu-chu, and Li Bo-jia, members of the Zhabei Grand Auditorium Preparatory Committee; Lu Bo-hong, Zhang Xiao-liang, Yao Mu-lian, Zhu Yin-jiang, Cai Jin-jun, Yang Shou-sheng, and Mao Zi-jian (represented by Yao Mu-lian), members of the Nanshi Grand Auditorium Preparatory Committee; Du Yue-sheng (represented by Li Ting-an), Zhang Ming-qin, Qu Yue, and Li Ting-an, members of the Pudong Health Clinic Preparatory Committee; Wang Bin-yan, Li Ting-an, Chen Bing-qian, Wang Yun-wu, Wang Pei-yuan, and Lu Bo-hong, members of the Zhabei Health Clinic Preparatory Committee; and Qu Wen-liu, Guan Jiong-zhi, Huang Han-zhi, Ye Yu-hu (represented by Li Da-chao), Wu Xing-ya (represented by Zhang Bing-hui), Cai Jin-jun, Li Ting-an, Shen Yi, and Wang Chang-chun, members of the Crematorium Preparatory Committee. Mayor Wu presided over the meeting and first reported on the purpose of the meeting (the speech will be recorded separately later). The following resolutions were then made: (1) The Yishi Garden is deemed the most suitable location for the Nanshi Grand Auditorium. It was resolved that if the location is designated as county property, negotiations should be held with the provincial public property office. (2) The intersection of Baotong Road and Qiujiang Road is deemed the most suitable location for the Zhabei Grand Auditorium, and public property is considered appropriate. The committee should promptly search for a suitable location for use. Regarding funding issues, Yao Mu-lian proposed that it would be best to plan and coordinate the Nanshi and Zhabei projects together. It was resolved that the two preparatory committees of Nanshi and Zhabei should hold a joint meeting to proceed. (3) For the Zhabei Health Clinic, Director Li Ting-an reported that a suitable plot of land has been purchased on Qingyun Road, with half of the land being public property and half being donated by a certain gentleman, with an approximate value of 14,000 yuan. (4) For the Pudong Health Clinic, Zhang Ming-qin reported that two locations are currently under investigation: one is the public property of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall in Lanmudu, about ten mu, and the other is the Qinsi Yangdian, about three mu, but not in one location, which seems unsuitable. It was resolved that the property of Tongren Fuyuan Hall is more suitable, and Lu Bo-hong is requested to contact the hall. Finally, Mayor Wu stated that the City God Temple is a must-visit destination for domestic and foreign visitors to Shanghai, and the Dianchun Hall, Cuixiu Hall, and the three gardens in the inner garden, which are representative of ancient Chinese architectural spirit, have not been opened to the public due to the involvement of various trade guilds, which is quite regrettable. He proposed that relevant committee members should find ways to negotiate and ensure their early opening. Mr. Yang Shou-sheng reported that the Dianchun Hall belongs to the foreign sundries trade guild, the Cuixiu Hall belongs to the bean and rice trade guild, and the inner garden belongs to the money trade guild. However, they are only used two or three times a year for meetings, and the annual repair costs are over 10,000 yuan. If the City Government requests them to open, they will certainly be willing. It was resolved that Mr. Yang, the Public Security Bureau, the Public Works Bureau, and the Social Affairs Bureau should contact the leaders of the respective guilds to ensure early opening.</p>
<p>Mayor Wu, in order to actively promote various social undertakings in the city, specially invited leaders from all sectors of the city, as well as members of the "Health Clinic", "Public Auditorium", "Crematorium", and other committees, to jointly discuss implementation methods. More than fifty people attended. The mayor gave a lengthy report with sincere words. An excerpt of the original manuscript is as follows:</p>
<p>Introduction: Gentlemen, I have invited you here today for lunch because I would like to ask you to jointly discuss the progress of several social construction projects, including the Zhabei Grand Auditorium, Nanshi Grand Auditorium, Pudong Health Clinic, Zhabei Health Clinic, and Crematorium. The City Government has designated this year as the year of social construction. There are many social construction projects that should be undertaken, but due to economic and other reasons, we cannot complete everything at once. Therefore, we can only gradually implement them based on the financial resources of the local government and society, as well as the urgency and priority of social needs.</p>
<p>People's Welfare Undertakings: Recently, we have decided to undertake two projects: one is the construction of 3,000 units of affordable housing, and the other is the improvement and relief of rickshaw pullers. We have already raised funds for these two projects and have established a People's Welfare Committee to start the work. The members of the People's Welfare Committee are all well-known figures in the city, both Chinese and foreign.</p>
<p>Literacy Campaign: Secondly, we will also launch a literacy education campaign this year, from July 1st to the end of June next year. During this year, we will provide compulsory literacy education to illiterate people in the urban area, so that everyone can read. According to previous estimates, there are about 500,000 illiterate people in the urban area of the city, excluding the two concessions. Therefore, we want to solve the problem of illiteracy in Shanghai in one year. We have also established a committee to start this work. For these projects, we earnestly hope that people from all walks of life in the local area will do their best to help us to promote their success.</p>
<p>School Construction: Secondly, regarding school construction, there are many schools in the city, but the school buildings of many schools are dilapidated or the facilities are incomplete. Therefore, we also want to raise funds to rebuild several municipal school buildings this year. Not only should the school buildings be renovated, but also the facilities should be as complete as possible. We have established another committee to actively carry out this work.</p>
<p>Health Clinics: As I said at the beginning of this meeting, we have gathered you here today to jointly discuss the progress of several social projects, including the Zhabei Grand Auditorium, Nanshi Grand Auditorium, Pudong Health Clinic, Zhabei Health Clinic, and Crematorium. The construction of health clinics is a very urgent need in the city. Currently, there are municipal health clinics in Gaoqiao, Wusong, Jiangwan, and Nanshi. After the establishment of these health clinics, the people in those areas have received many benefits. This is a fact that everyone can see. For example, before the establishment of the Gaoqiao Health Clinic, the infant mortality rate in Gaoqiao was 40%. After the establishment of the Gaoqiao Health Clinic, it has been reduced to 3% or 4%. In other words, before the establishment of the Gaoqiao Health Clinic, 40 out of 100 babies in Gaoqiao died. After the establishment of the Gaoqiao Health Clinic, only 3 or 4 out of 100 babies died. It is clear that the establishment of health clinics has led to a sharp decrease in infant mortality rates. For example, the people in Jiangwan and the students in the numerous schools near Jiangwan have also benefited greatly from the establishment of the Jiangwan Health Clinic, such as eye and dental examinations for students, etc., with a large number of people every day. For example, at the Nanshi Health Clinic, about 600 people used to go there every day for medical treatment and medicine. Now, it has almost increased to 1,000 people. This proves the urgent need for health clinics. Although there are already hospitals in Nanshi and Zhabei, the nature and functions of hospitals and health clinics are different. The Pudong and Zhabei health clinics are still lacking. Therefore, we want to quickly establish health clinics in Pudong and Zhabei to provide medical treatment and medicine to facilitate the local people and manage public health affairs. This is the reason why we want to build the Pudong and Zhabei health clinics.</p>
<p>Public Auditoriums: Secondly, regarding the construction of the Zhabei Grand Auditorium and Nanshi Grand Auditorium, we also feel that the need to build auditoriums is very urgent. Nanshi now has a population of 617,573 people, and Zhabei now has a population of 697,194 people. Nanshi has almost 620,000 people, and Zhabei has almost 700,000 people. Since there are so many people in these two places, the number of weddings, funerals, and celebrations among these people is of course not small. Therefore, the need to build auditoriums is of course very urgent. Now, because of the lack of auditoriums in these two places, people have to use hotels, restaurants, and temples to hold weddings, funerals, and celebrations, which makes the etiquette very undignified and the unnecessary waste is too great. Therefore, we want to build a grand auditorium in Nanshi and a grand auditorium in Zhabei for the people of Nanshi and Zhabei to hold weddings, funerals, and celebrations. Moreover, public auditoriums have three advantages. The first is simplicity. We want to make the various facilities in the auditoriums we want to build as complete and appropriate as possible for weddings, funerals, and celebrations. If someone has a wedding, funeral, or celebration and wants to hold it in the auditorium, all the facilities inside are available, and the procedures can be simplified a lot. The second is economy. If there are weddings, funerals, and celebrations, they must be held in accordance with the most economical rules set by the auditorium in terms of clothing, hats, shoes, socks, and other items, so as to conform to the principle of economy. The third is dignity. If it is only simple and economical, the rich people in society may not come, because they think it is too simple and economical. What they want is excitement. The auditoriums we want to build are very dignified. Dignity cannot be bought with money. All the facilities and etiquette in our auditoriums are carefully researched and stipulated, which are completely different from the worldly extravagance. In addition, the function of the auditoriums is not only to serve as social centers, but we can also use them as places for all public gatherings and training, so they can also become centers for public education. Since building auditoriums has so many benefits, we cannot but build these kinds of auditoriums in order to improve customs, change the atmosphere, promote thrift, and popularize public education. The auditoriums we plan to build are very large in scale. We want to set up a larger auditorium inside, which can accommodate about 500 people, and build several smaller auditoriums next to it, which can accommodate about 100 or 200 people, so that several families can hold events at the same time. In addition, we will set up restaurants, teahouses, and formal wear shops on both sides, where everything should be available, and all prices should be very low, so as to facilitate economy and take both sides into account.</p>
<p>Crematorium: Regarding the construction of crematoriums, we want to build two crematoriums, one in Pudong and one in Puxi. For the sake of Shanghai's cityscape, land, and public health, it is necessary to build public cemeteries and promote cremation. Therefore, we want to set up two crematoriums first, because we can see many graves in the city, no matter where we go, and even many coffins are exposed in the fields. This not only hinders our cityscape, transportation roads, and public health, but also makes us who are alive feel uneasy. Therefore, the construction of crematoriums should also be paid attention to by us.</p>
<p>Must Be Implemented: The above are the projects that we want to undertake in this year of social construction. We will designate April and May as the preparatory period for health clinics, and June as the construction period. We will designate April, May, and June as the preparatory period for auditoriums, and July as the construction period. We also plan to build crematoriums within this year. The City Government is determined to implement these projects, so even in today's very difficult financial situation, it will also try its best to raise funds to handle them. The City Government has planned to allocate a sum of money, but it is not enough, so it is necessary to ask local people to do their best to support it, so as to speed up its success.</p>
<p>Hope for Citizen Cooperation: I think municipal administration is the most capable of expressing the spirit of self-government. Although we have not yet fully reached the era of self-government, as long as the people can contribute to the local area, they can express the spirit of self-government. Therefore, all the members of the City Government, in the future, in all the construction of new social undertakings, not only when preparing, will invite local leaders to participate in the preparation, but also after the construction is completed, in terms of management, they still want to invite local people to participate in the management. For example, the stadium, gymnasium, swimming pool, library, museum, municipal hospital, and municipal health clinic, etc., built by the City Government last year, are all like this. Because of this, on the one hand, it can express the cooperation between the government and the people, and on the other hand, it is also to promote the realization of local self-government. Therefore, we ask you to do your best to support the social projects that will be built recently, so that we can see their success as soon as possible.</p>

<h3>Foreign Taxpayers' Annual Meeting New Motions: Music, House Tax, Land Purchase, Telephone, and Other Issues</h3>
<p>In addition to the various motions submitted by the Public Works Department at this year's Foreign Taxpayers' Annual Meeting, the following motions have now been submitted by the taxpayers: (1) Please transfer the band to a suitable organization for takeover, donate all the scores and instruments, and the taxpayers shall approve an annual subsidy not exceeding 150,000 yuan.

<h3>The Ministry of Finance and the Wan Guo Savings Society's Tax Contract is Cancelled Because the Society Resists Paying Savings Guarantee Reserves; Collection of Taxes Payable Under the Contract is also Suspended</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that according to a statement published by the Ministry of Finance, although the Wan Guo Savings Society is a French company, it should be handled in accordance with the Sino-French Commercial Treaty. However, in the third year of the Republic of China, the society had already been approved for registration by the former Ministry of Finance, and should abide by Chinese laws. The tax contract signed between the Ministry and the Society in the eighteenth year of the Republic of China clearly stated, "The Ministry of Finance of the Republic of China allows the Wan Guo Savings Society to register and, in accordance with the current savings regulations and company regulations, grants it special permission to operate in China and protects it." This means that the Society must abide by current Chinese laws and be protected to operate in China. The contract provisions are very clear. In July of this year, the Ministry issued an order to all savings banks and associations to deposit guarantee reserves equivalent to one-quarter of the total amount of savings in a specially established treasury of the Central Bank, in accordance with Article 9 of the current Savings Bank Law, to protect depositors. All savings banks and associations have complied with this order, but the Society alone has delayed compliance. Although it has been earnestly persuaded, the Society still refused on various pretexts. Since the Society has expressed its unwillingness to abide by current laws and regulations, it has violated the provisions of the contract. All previous contracts signed between the Ministry and the Society should be canceled, and the taxes payable under the contract should not be paid starting from October 16. In addition, Article 14 of the Savings Bank Law stipulates that prize-winning savings should be prohibited. For prize-winning savings that have been handled before the implementation of this law, the collection of savings deposits should be stopped immediately, and the closing method should be formulated by the Ministry of Finance and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. In addition to the Ministry formulating the closing method in accordance with the law and submitting it to the Yuan for approval before instructing compliance, and informing the Central Bank to suspend tax collection, it has been ordered to the Wan Guo Savings Society to comply.</p>
<h3>Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Writes to the Public Works Department to Oppose Telephone Price Increases: Failure to Ease May Lead to Accidents</h3>
<p>Yu Zuoting, Chairman of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, previously attended the Public Works Department's Public Utilities Committee to express his opposition to telephone price increases and stated everything. It is reported that Mr. Yu has now supplemented a letter to the Director-General of the Public Works Department, stating that today's Shanghai is experiencing an extraordinary economic panic, and all citizens are trembling to overcome this difficult situation. All shops that can balance income and expenditure are considered fortunate. The Shanghai Telephone Company is a member of the Shanghai business community, and in this time of crisis, it has already obtained a profit of six percent. It should restrain itself and share the joys and sorrows with the citizens of Shanghai. The letter expressed a firm opposition to the pay-per-use method, saying that if a way to ease the situation is not found, unexpected events may occur that the Department does not want to hear about.</p>
<h3>Telephone Price Increase Issue: Japanese Residents Firmly Oppose, Will Propose for Discussion at Taxpayers' Meeting</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Telephone Company announced the increase in fees, it has aroused unanimous opposition from Chinese and foreign merchants, and Japanese residents are particularly激昂. A few days ago, Japanese residents sent representatives to the Public Works Department to propose a recommendation against the telephone price increase. The Public Works Department authorities replied that the telephone company's actions were based on the contract previously signed between the Department and the telephone company. If the Department prevented the company from increasing prices, the Department would lose its credibility in the future. During the meeting, the Public Works Department hoped that the Japanese representatives would withdraw the opposing recommendation. The Japanese representatives brought the original proposal back and re-deliberated with all relevant parties, and then slightly modified it. Subsequently, it was submitted to the Public Works Department again, but because the submission time had passed, it could only be submitted at the Western Taxpayers' Meeting on the 17th of this month. According to the opinions of the Japanese residents, it is generally believed that although the Public Works Department has the difficulties of having to allow the telephone company to increase prices, there is absolutely no reason to increase them in this period of economic recession. Therefore, if the Japanese side's opposing recommendation can be passed at the Taxpayers' Congress, the Public Works Department will encounter great difficulties. In the past two or three days, Japanese residents' groups and merchants from all walks of life have made opposing the telephone price increase their main topic. Judging from the current situation, Japanese residents have indeed made a firm decision to oppose it, and will not stop until they achieve their goal.</p>
<h3>Central Mint Slows Down Casting New Model Silver Coins: Currently, 300,000 Yuan Can Be Cast Daily</h3>
<p>Xin Xin News Agency reports that since Chen Xing, Vice President of the Central Bank, also served as the Director of the Central Mint, Mr. Chen has spared no effort in internal reorganization. Regarding the proposed casting of the new model silver coins in the 24th year, according to a spokesperson for the factory speaking to a reporter from Xin Xin News Agency, the diameter of the new model silver coins in the 24th year seems to be smaller in appearance, but in fact, its silver content is completely equal to that of the silver coins in the 23rd year. Fearing that it would cause misunderstandings outside when issued, the casting has been slowed down. It is also heard that the factory can currently cast about 300,000 yuan of new coins every day.</p>
<h3>Industry and Commerce: The Difficulties at the End of April Have All Been Resolved Independently</h3>
<p>Industry and commerce, recognizing the market downturn and the need for leniency regarding loans due at the end of April, requested accommodation. The Bankers' Association has now resolved to inform its member banks. However, industry and commerce, with April approaching, have independently found solutions to safely navigate this difficult period. As for the Central Bank of China and the Bank of Communications, in order to indirectly assist industry and commerce, requests for interbank lending to the silver and money trades will be handled according to the procedures used at the end of the 23rd year of the Republic of China (1934). The Central Bank will announce the daily interbank lending rates.</p>
<h3>Sericulture Association Executive Committee Member He Shangping Left for Hangzhou Yesterday</h3>
<p>Due to the fact that the Qingming Festival has passed and silkworms will soon hatch at the Hangzhou Group Seed Production Farm of the National Economic Council's Sericulture Improvement Association, and that 760,000 sheets of silkworm eggs obtained from the Improvement Association have not yet been distributed, a telegram was sent a few days ago to He Shangping, a member of the association's executive committee, urging him to go to Hangzhou as soon as possible to assist in the distribution. After receiving the telegram, Mr. He took the Shanghai-Hangzhou express train yesterday morning and left Shanghai for Hangzhou.</p>

<h3>Art Exhibition: Fourth Day of the Preview Exhibition, Clear Weather Brings More Visitors; Closing Time Extended to 6 PM</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, yesterday was the fourth day of the Shanghai preview exhibition of the Chinese Art Exhibition in London. Because the weather was clear, the number of visitors increased compared to the previous day, and the staff of the exhibition felt even busier. A reporter from the Central News Agency met with the person in charge of the exhibition, who said:</p>
<p>Extended Opening Hours: The original opening hours of the exhibition were from 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM daily. However, in recent days, numerous office workers have sent letters stating that due to work commitments, they requested that the exhibition be extended to 6:00 PM. This suggestion was adopted by the exhibition, and starting yesterday, the ticket sales time was extended to 6:00 PM. The entrance will be closed after 6:00 PM, while the exit will be closed at 7:00 PM for viewing convenience.</p>
<p>Convenience for All-Day Visitors: The exhibition also recognizes that many people wish to browse all day but lack a place to eat. Arrangements can now be made for visitors to bring snacks and deposit them at the cloakroom upon entry. When needed, visitors can retrieve their snacks and eat them in the reception room. The exhibition provides complimentary tea to meet needs without charge.</p>
<p>Precious Yao Bian Porcelain: The Yao Bian porcelain displayed in the porcelain section is extremely precious. This type of porcelain is originally green, but due to the heat of the kiln, it can turn purple when fired. This is a rare and fortuitous occurrence. Most Yao Bian porcelain sold on the market is artificially produced, and the prices are vastly different.</p>
<p>Considering Group Discounts: In recent days, many academic groups have sent letters requesting preferential treatment for group visitors. The exhibition authorities are currently considering this matter in detail. It is expected that each group ticket will require at least ten people, and the price will be calculated at half price, costing one yuan per person. Once this plan is finalized, a public announcement will be made in the newspaper.</p>
<p>Arrival of More Ancient Books from Beiping: The National Beiping Library has sent a total of 50 types of rare ancient books to the exhibition. Thirty types have already been sent and displayed, and the remaining twenty types have now been sent by mail. They will be numbered and displayed upon arrival. The list of books is as follows: (1) Two types of Six Dynasties manuscripts: one volume of the Great Expansive Buddha Flower Garland Sutra and one volume of the Great Nirvana Sutra; (2) One type of Five Dynasties woodblock print: one volume of the Dharani Sutra; (3) Three types of Song Dynasty prints: one volume of Selections of Refined Literature, one volume of the Book Treasury of the Primal Tortoise, and one volume of Two Hundred Scholars' Literary Essences; (4) One type of Yuan Dynasty print: one volume of the Xuanhe Catalog of Antiquities; (5) Three types of Ming Dynasty movable copper type prints: one volume of Literary Compendium, one volume of Yan Lugong's Collected Works, and one volume of the Taiping Imperial Reader; (6) Three types of Ming Dynasty color prints: one volume of Meng Haoran's Collected Works, one volume of Wang Wei's Collected Works, and one volume of the Ten Bamboo Studio Manual of Painting; (7) Three types of Qing Dynasty color prints: one volume of the Golden Canon of Moral Exhortation, one volume of the Imperially Commissioned Collection of Lyrics, and one volume of the Ancient Prose Mirror; (8) One type of Qing Dynasty woodcut painting: one volume of the Farming and Weaving Pictures; (9) Three types of Western Xia texts: one volume of the Western Xia Golden Light Sutra of the Most Victorious Kings, one volume of the Western Xia Sutra of Different Appearances of Disciplines, and one volume of the Western Xia Great Expansive Buddha Flower Garland Sutra. The above twenty types, ranging from the Six Dynasties to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, are all fine ancient books of immense value.</p>
<p>A Collection of Anecdotes from the Exhibition: According to general observation, visitors to the exhibition's Sixth Exhibition Room yesterday generally paid more attention to the rare ancient books, especially the Romance of the Western Chamber, because the Romance of the Western Chamber is a famous Chinese literary work and the book's version is very old. Most Westerners do not understand Chinese, so they do not pay much attention to the ancient books, except for a few, and focus on jade artifacts, carvings, etc. However, there are also exceptions. Yesterday morning, two Western men and women spent a long time reading the Song Dynasty print of the Book of Music, the early Ming Dynasty print of Liu Xiang's Garden of Stories, and other rare ancient books, and commented on the quality of their versions. They also praised the craftsmanship of the illustrations in the Kangxi print of the Longevity Grand Ceremony. Among the jade artifacts, a yellow jade interlocking button seal attracted the most attention, and everyone praised its exquisite carving. Yesterday, one person asked another, "Isn't it too much of a sacrifice to carve a whole piece of jade into only three small seals?" The answerer said, "Its preciousness lies precisely in this." The remark was very witty. After browsing, the visitors were all very satisfied. Yesterday, several white-haired elderly people said, "In all my life, I have never seen so many treasures. I am truly fortunate to have seen so many treasures today."</p>

<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Economic Association, organized by local real estate developers, held a subcommittee meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday at the Ningbo Road Da Kang Bank Clubhouse. Cheng Haiqiu, Cheng Linsheng, Zhang Qinbo, Yu Huancheng, Bao Yaoting, Qian Chengxu, Wu Muhen, Zhou Jianchu, Shen Lianfang, and Zhou Weishi attended.

<h3>Zhabei Sanitation Workers Went on a Half-Day Strike Yesterday Morning; Party Headquarters Promised to be Responsible for Recovering Wages and Followed Advice to Resume Work in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>According to the New Voice News Agency, the sanitation department of the Zhabei District is contracted out by Chen Shaofu from the Finance Bureau for a monthly fee of 2,400 yuan. Hengfeng Road Wharf is subcontracted to Xu Fengji, and Hongjiang Bridge Wharf is contracted by Chen Shaofu himself. Wuzhen Road Bridge Yongsheng Wharf was initially contracted to Quanji Company's Wang Peixian, but on March 2, Wang Peixian was unable to continue the contract and owed workers more than 700 yuan in wages, so he returned the contract to Chen Shaofu. The workers had disputes with the main contractor over wage demands. The case is currently being litigated in court.</p>
<p>Implementation of a Strike: After Chen Shaofu took over the contract, not only did he not pay the wages for the previous month, but the wages for April, amounting to 1,017 yuan, were also not paid on time. On the 4th, the workers negotiated again, and the contractor promised to pay on the 10th, but the main contractor avoided meeting them. Therefore, 193 workers at Yongsheng Wharf stopped working at 4:30 AM yesterday and went on strike.</p>
<p>Party Headquarters Mediation: The city party headquarters, based on a report from the Sixth District Sanitation Workers' Union, learned of the strike action and sent Lu Yinchu to Zhabei at 10:00 AM yesterday to mediate and investigate. However, the mediation was unsuccessful because the contractor avoided meeting them. Lu then went to the Finance and Health Bureaus to inquire about the situation. The Finance Bureau agreed to pursue Chen Shaofu and promised a concrete response in three days. The party headquarters representative then informed the sanitation workers to resume work first, and promised to guarantee that the full wages would be paid on the 15th.</p>
<p>Resumption of Work in the Afternoon: The sanitation workers of Yongsheng Wharf in the Sixth District Sanitation Workers' Union, because the party headquarters had guaranteed the payment of wages, suspended the petition. In order to maintain the peace of the residents, they ordered all members to drive their carts and carry their loads to serve the roads as usual, and the order was good, and everything was restored to its original state, awaiting the legal disposition of the authorities.</p>

Administrative Yuan Secretary-General Chu Minyi arrived in Shanghai on the same train as Mr. Tang yesterday morning.</p>
<h3>A Siamese Inspection Team Will Come to China; Overseas Chinese Chen Wentian Will Also Return to His Ancestral Country Again</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Mr. Chen Wentian, President of the Lobmuang Daily News, a Siamese newspaper in Bangkok, returned to China for inspection in 1933 and had an excellent impression of his ancestral country. After returning to Siam, he felt that promoting Chinese goods overseas was an urgent task, so he worked tirelessly and planned the Bangkok Chinese National Products Exhibition Hall. It is now known that his plan is ready, and he plans to return to Shanghai to liaise with Chinese merchants. He also agreed with the more than 20 members of the People's Congress Committee sent by the Siamese government to Japan for inspection to meet in the capital in mid-June. It is expected that Mr. Chen will arrive in Shanghai in early June. The more than 20 people sent by Siam departed from Bangkok on the 3rd of this month and will pass through Penang, Ipoh, Kuala Lumpur, Malacca, Singapore, Sumatra, and then go to Tokyo, Japan. After completing their inspection in Japan, they will take the northeast route south and arrive in Beiping on June 7th. They will stay in Beiping and Tianjin for four or five days, and then take the Shanghai-Beiping train south and arrive in Beijing on June 16th, and then stay in the Beijing-Shanghai area for a week for inspection.</p>

Mr. Feierte arrived in Shanghai a few days ago and immediately contacted the Reception Office and the American-Chinese Trade Association on all matters. When the Executive Committee of the Reception Office met yesterday, Mr. Feierte also attended as an observer. He is scheduled to return to Japan today to report to Mr. Forbes. According to a telegram from Japan received by the Reception Office yesterday, it has been decided to come to China according to the original date and stay at the International Hotel.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Presented to the Ministry of Finance Requesting Refund of Unified Tax on Industrial Alcohol; Imported Goods Do Not Need to Pay Unified Tax, Domestic Tax Refunds Have Precedents</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce presented to the Ministry of Finance, stating that the Pharmaceutical Manufacturers Association stated in a letter that alcohol is a necessary raw material in industry and a military chemical for national defense. The manufacture of ether and military hygiene materials also largely use alcohol as a raw material. Since the government levied a unified tax of 16.5 cents per liter, prices have risen sharply, and the cost of various industrial products has also increased. It is essential that industrial and commercial interests emphasize cost. In addition, at a time when foreign goods are aggressively sold to China and the trade deficit is increasing year by year, the government should find ways to reduce the cost of domestic industrial goods to compete with foreign goods and save the economic crisis. Since the government levied a unified tax on alcohol, the tariffs on imported products made from alcohol, such as cosmetics, artificial silk, and new medicines, have not been increased, nor have taxes equal to the unified tax been imposed. This is tantamount to guiding the influx of foreign goods and stifling the vitality of domestic industries. However, everyone knows that the national treasury is in deficit. If the government's tax revenue does not violate the principles of the national economy, the people will do their best to pay it. The unified tax on alcohol has also been implemented in countries such as Japan, but the government of that country refunds the unified tax on alcohol used as industrial raw materials. This ensures that tax revenue and the national treasury are taken care of, and the national industrial goods are also relied upon. There is no better way to achieve both goals. The association requests that the Ministry of Finance be requested to refer to the established rules of other countries and refund the unified tax on alcohol raw materials used in industry to benefit industry and commerce and maintain industry. The Chamber of Commerce investigated the matter and found that since the unified tax on alcohol was changed from being paid by marketing stores with tax stamps to being collected at the factory or by the customs when imported goods are declared, although the tax rate is lower than the previous tax rate on foreign liquors, the change in the method of taxation has inevitably increased costs compared to the past when factories were located in the concessions and had no tax burden. At the same time, similar imported goods from abroad, because the factory is not located in the country, do not need to pay the unified tax on raw materials. Because the cost is lower, competing in the market is advantageous. At a time when foreign goods are flooding the market and everyone is discussing how to save the trade deficit, this situation cannot be ignored. The association's request to refund the unified tax on alcohol used in industry, referring to the established rules of other countries, is for the purpose of reducing costs and competing with foreign goods. Moreover, the raw material tax refund, such as the refund of taxes on foreign wheat used by flour mills, has a precedent, and the matter is not an innovation. There are no obstacles to implementation. The Ministry should be requested to review and approve the implementation for the sake of public convenience.</p>

<h3>A Batch of Saigon Rice Continued to Arrive; South American Ocean Wheat Also Arrived in Large Quantities</h3>
<p>Approximately 400,000 to 500,000 piculs of Saigon ocean rice arrived this week, and another million piculs are on their way to Shanghai. At 6:50 AM yesterday, the Winifoed Moller arrived with 5,000 tons of Saigon ocean rice and is scheduled to open the hatches and unload today. As for the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's Haiqi ship, the 40,000 bags of ocean rice it transported from Bangkok were originally intended to be delivered in Ningbo. However, after arriving in the city, the buyer claimed that the rice did not match the sample and refused to accept it, so it was returned to Shanghai and is now being unloaded and stored in the North Warehouse. The flour mills in this port have ordered a large quantity of ocean wheat from South America, and seven batches totaling more than 40,000 tons have been delivered. Another ship arrived yesterday with 7,500 tons and is being unloaded in the Huangpu River.</p>

<p>Luo Tong (courtesy name Wusen, from Jianghua, Hunan), the newly appointed president of the Shanghai Local Court, arrived at the court at 9:00 AM yesterday to take office and will be sworn in at a later date. The former president, Shen Xiqing, has been instructing the various departments to rush to complete all handover procedures in recent days. It was not until 11:00 PM the night before that the work was completed. Mr. Shen then left the court and took a car back to his residence.

I hereby announce that I have arrived at the court on April 11th of this year to take office, and have reported and ordered accordingly. This notice is hereby given for general knowledge."</p>
<h3>Incense Festival at Longhua Temple</h3>
<p>Longhua Temple in western Shanghai, a famous ancient temple and ten-direction monastery in the Jiangnan region, was built in the Chiwu period of the Eastern Wu Dynasty at the end of the Han Dynasty. It has been renowned far and wide, especially since Shanghai opened as a port, and it is praised by Chinese and foreigners alike. In the last ten years or so, due to the impact of war, the temples have been destroyed and the monasteries have been desolate. Visitors all lament the past and present. Last year, the Chinese Buddhist Association specially resolved to invite Elder Xingkong of Mount Emei to come down the mountain to Shanghai to preside over the temple affairs. After receiving the position, Xingkong embraced the grand aspiration of reviving Longhua Temple and worked diligently and tirelessly. With the efforts and support of Master Yongchan, Dafen, Liyuan, Liaoyuan, Yuanming, and other monks and laypeople in charge, he took responsibility for organizing the temple, requested the government to issue a protection order, and carried out major renovations, clearing the temple property, and borrowing large sums of money to construct buildings and renovate Buddhist statues. In less than a year, everything was restored. In the spring of this year, he started the Great Thousand Buddhas Precepts, which had not been held for decades. From April 3rd, he hired eminent monks to preach and hired the famous Shanghai doctor Zhang Chenglu to provide medical treatment. Monks and laypeople from far and wide benefited from the Buddha's kindness. Recently, with the bright spring weather, the incense festival has reopened. Buddhist disciples and spring tourists who go to the temple to worship and offer incense number no less than 30,000 people every day. Peach blossoms line the Longhua Road, and carriages and horses are like dragons. It is heard that the crowds are twice as large as in previous years, making it a grand occasion. However, the temple renovation project is very large, and only one-third has been completed. The unfinished project requires a huge amount of money. Furthermore, with the formal performance of the new precepts, monks and nuns from various provinces are arriving in a steady stream, and there is a risk of "too many monks and not enough porridge." If benefactors and believers from all walks of life wish to form a good relationship and are willing to donate, please send the donations directly to the temple treasury and receive a receipt.</p>
<h3>News from the Excavation of the Yuji Mound Waterway; Director Chen Xueneng and Others Presented Another Petition to the Executive Yuan</h3>
<p>The Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Commission is excavating the Yuji Mound section of the Wusong River. The villagers have repeatedly presented petitions because their fields are being taken and their livelihoods are at stake. It is now known that although the local people have seen the announcement in the newspaper by the Taihu Lake Water Conservancy Commission that it has been approved by the National Economic Council to use motorized ships for dredging in order to facilitate ship traffic, there has been no real response to the people's petitions. Now, Director Chen Xueneng, Zhang Yigan, Yao Jianqing, Zhang Tishun, Yuan Jibo, Zhang Yuncheng, and others have presented a petition to the Executive Yuan of the National Government requesting relief. It is expected that there will be a clear instruction within days. I will record this to see what happens.</p>

<h3>Public Works Bureau: Promoting Traffic within the Settlement; New Regulations Strictly Limiting Vehicle Parking to Be Implemented Soon</h3>
<p>The Public Works Bureau's Police Department believes that the arbitrary parking of vehicles within the Settlement significantly hinders improvements in public transportation and freight delivery, and also causes great inconvenience to store customers and those conducting business. Therefore, it intends to draft regulations to address this issue. It is planned to issue a public notice for nine months first, followed by a sixty-day notice before implementation. The scope includes the area starting from the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Xiaoshadu Road in the west, south to Foch Road and Avenue Edward VII, east to the Bund, and northeast to the intersection of Broadway Road and Fearon Road. After the public notice and before implementation, it is hoped that private individuals will prepare parking spaces. Once this step is completed, the traffic regulations will be formally revised, stipulating that vehicles are not allowed to park for extended periods except in designated areas.</p>
<p>(1) On the following roads – Beijing Road, Nanjing Road, Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Fuzhou Road, Guangdong Road, Avenue Edward VII, Jing'an Temple Road (west to Xiaoshadu Road), Foch Road, Bund Road, Yuanmingyuan Road, Sichuan Road, Jiangxi Road, Henan Road, Fujian Road, Zhejiang Road, Xizang Road, Broadway Road (east to Fearon Road) – parking is not allowed for more than 30 minutes daily from 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM, except on holidays. Exceptions are listed in the next clause.</p>
<p>(1) Permitted parking locations are: (1) The Bund, from Suzhou Road to Avenue Edward VII (the central part of the road), except in front of the Customs Wharf; (2) the north side of Suzhou Road, between Henan Road and the Bund; (3) the west side of Museum Road; (4) the north side of Huangpu Road, from Museum Road to near number 20; (5) the recessed areas on the south side of Jing'an Temple Road, between Xizang Road and Mohawk Road, except daily from 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM and 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM on non-holidays; (6) Avenue Edward VII, in the areas between the small houses, parallel to the road.</p>
<p>(1) Parking is strictly prohibited within the following sections during the specified times: (1) Ningbo Road, between Sichuan Road and Henan Road, south side, 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM; north side, 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM; (2) Renji Road, south side, 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM; north side, 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM; (3) Hong Kong Road, between Museum Road and Sichuan Road, north side, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (4) Nanjing Road, north side, 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM and 1:30 PM to 2:30 PM; south side, 11:30 AM to 12:30 PM and 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM; (5) Hankou Road, between Sichuan Road and Jiangxi Road, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (6) Jing'an Temple Road, south side, between Xizang Road and Mohawk Road, 12:00 PM to 1:00 PM and 4:30 PM to 6:00 PM; (7) Huangpu Road, from Museum Hotel to Waibaidu Bridge, at all times; (8) Guangdong Road, between the Bund and Sichuan Road, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (9) The Bund, west side, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (10) Hankou Road outside [the specified section]; (11) Fuzhou Road, between the Bund and Jiangxi Road, south side, 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM; north side, 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM; (12) Jiangxi Road, between Fuzhou Road and Avenue Edward VII, west side, 8:00 AM to 1:00 PM; east side, 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM; (13) Beijing Road, between the Bund and Sichuan Road, north side, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (14) Jiujiang Road, between the Bund and Henan Road, north side, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (15) Jiangxi Road, between Hankou Road and Fuzhou Road, east side, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (16) Jiangxi Road, between Jiujiang Road and Hankou Road, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (17) Henan Road, between Beijing Road and Guangdong Road, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (18) Yuanmingyuan Road, east side, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (19) Museum Road, east side, 8:00 AM to 6:00 PM; (20) Jiujiang Road, west of [Sichuan] Road to Yinghua Street, north side; (21) Jiujiang Road, between Guangxi Road and Zhejiang Road, north side; (22) Jiujiang Road, between Zhili Road and Shanxi Road, north side; (23) Guizhou Road, between Nanjing Road and Tianjin Road, west side; (24) Mohawk Road, between Jing'an Temple Road and Weihaiwei Road, west side, except on race days; (25) Longmen Road; (26) Anywhere with a "No Parking" sign.</p>
<p>This plan has been thoroughly discussed by the Traffic Committee, which expressed its support in principle. However, some specific regulations may still need revision. According to the Chief of the Public Works Department, a survey conducted one year ago in the central district showed that 1,500 cars parked daily east of Henan Road, with 450 of them parked on the Bund. In recent years, there have been proposals to open taxi garages in the central district, but these have not been possible due to the long-term parking of cars on the roads. If road restrictions are implemented, these types of garages could be opened, with the area near Henan Road being suitable. The rent would be around 20 yuan per car per month.</p>
<p>It is reported that publicly owned parking garages in the United States are profitable. Therefore, if private individuals cannot operate them, the Public Works Bureau could consider running them itself. Furthermore, there are many private buildings with surplus vacant land that could be converted into parking spaces, which would immediately alleviate traffic congestion. The Committee finally resolved to request that the Board of Directors adopt the principles of the plan proposed by the Chief of the Police Department and, during his leave, ask him to investigate traffic conditions in various countries. Upon his return to Shanghai after nine months, he can revise the proposed regulations and then implement them with a sixty-day notice. This case was submitted to the Board of Directors on April 10 and was approved.</p>
<p>Furthermore, this crackdown plan applies to rickshaws and other vehicles in addition to automobiles.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education: Investigating and Banning Obscene Books; Managers of Various Bookstores Released on Bail Pending Trial</h3>
<p>Recently, the Municipal Bureau of Education noted that various bookstores in the Shandong Road and Fuzhou Road area of the Shanghai International Settlement were excessively publishing a type of erotic novel with bizarre titles and extremely obscene language. If strict measures were not taken to ban them, it would be insufficient to maintain morality and rectify social customs. Therefore, Bureau Chief Pan Gongzhan sent a letter to the First Special District Court, requesting assistance in the crackdown. The court issued a search warrant, which was delivered to the political department of the general police station. On the 26th of last month, detectives Deng Hailin and Jiang Shangpei were dispatched to the Daxin Bookstore at No. 62, Lane 140, Shandong Road, where they seized 29 copies of "New Theory of Lust." They also went to the Manli Bookstore on the same road, seizing 1,729 copies of "History of Seduction," the Xinzhi Bookstore, seizing 100 copies of "Tide," the Huanqiu Bookstore, seizing 140 copies of "Unofficial History of Wu," and the Wenhua Bookstore, seizing 900 copies of "Secret History of the Dance Hall." All were taken to the police station and transferred to the Special Court for temporary storage. Meanwhile, Zhang Shizhu, a lawyer from the Public Works Bureau's legal department, first prosecuted Dai Shiying, manager of the Daxin Bookstore, and Wu Yilu, manager of the Manli Bookstore, for the crime of disseminating or selling obscene literature under Article 251, Section 1 of the Criminal Law. Yesterday morning, the two defendants, Dai and Wu, were summoned to the Second Criminal Court of the First Special Court for questioning. The police lawyer, Zhang Shizhu, presented the aforementioned facts. After a brief interrogation by the English judge, both defendants were ordered to post bail: Dai for 100 yuan and Wu for 300 yuan, pending a further hearing on Saturday morning.</p>
<h3>Japanese Residents in Arrears on Rent, Requesting Assistance from the Consulate; Thirteen Lawsuits Filed Monthly, with Arrears of at Least Seven or Eight Months</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Japanese-language newspaper "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" reported that due to the increased cost of living, those living on meager salaries are unable to purchase goods, leading to an increasingly severe recession. Sales of goods have decreased, inventory is piling up, and small and medium-sized merchants in the middle class are experiencing extreme hardship. The most serious problem is housing. Due to financial difficulties, they cannot pay their rent and are repeatedly in arrears. Last year, approximately 200 lawsuits were filed with the consulate due to rent arrears, averaging seventeen cases per day. In March of this year, there were thirteen cases, fewer than last year, but the landlords were all non-Japanese. Last year, there were also many lawsuits filed by Japanese landlords such as the Dongxing Land Association and the Zhonghe Hospital. Among the thirteen rent arrears lawsuits in March, eleven were filed by Chinese landlords and two by Western landlords. All thirteen cases demanded immediate eviction. Although the consulate has ruled for a stay of execution, the rent owed is as high as 1,500 yuan for twenty months, and as low as seven months. The Western landlords have hired lawyers and are making strong demands. Fortunately, the Chinese landlords are more pragmatic and resolve the issue with a promissory note. If this recession continues, rent arrears will increase rapidly.</p>
<h3>Triad Members Rampant in the Hongkou Area; Courageous and Skilled Fighters, Cases Abound; Zhu Dingfu's Machete Attack Case Awaits Sentencing</h3>
<p>Gao Shuanglin from Yangzhou, also known as Little Leather Artisan, gathered a gang armed with axes at 3:00 PM on the 24th of last month in front of the Huiquan Bathhouse in Taili Lane, Burton Road, and attacked Zhu Dingfu from Ningbo, injuring his head, hands, and feet in seven places before fleeing. The case was discovered and the culprits apprehended by Chinese detectives Wang Runhe and Bao Shuji, taken to the Hongkou Police Station, and sent to the First Special District Court. They confessed to being involved in a gambling dispute and claimed that A-Han, who was at large, committed the attack. Because the victim was seriously injured at the Baolong Hospital on Baker Road and could not appear, the court ordered the suspects to be remanded in custody pending a further hearing. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzhi presided over the trial in the Third Criminal Court. The Public Works Bureau lawyer, Li Zhishan, stated that the victim's injuries had improved slightly and that he was present to testify. Zhu Dingfu testified that he lived at No. 19 Hongxing Lane, Burton Road, and was a fishmonger. He had known the defendant for many years. The defendant asked him to take a bath at the bathhouse. After the bath, he fell asleep for a short time. The defendant took the opportunity to go outside to buy cigarettes and agreed with more than ten members of the Triad gang who were waiting outside to start a fight. After a while, he and the defendant walked out together. As soon as they left the door, they were surrounded. The defendant first attacked, pulling out a sharp axe and hacking at his head. He defended himself with his arms, otherwise he would have been killed by the first blow. The other injuries were inflicted by the gang members. He did not owe them any gambling debts. When questioned, the defendant insisted that the attack was carried out by A-Han, who was at large, and made evasive statements. Lawyer Li stated that the defendant was also a member of the Triad. The gang members in the Hongkou area are courageous and skilled fighters. Similar cases abound. He recently heard of another incident where someone was injured with an axe in a fight. These actions greatly disturb social peace. The defendant used an axe to attack the victim's head, intending to kill him. His heart is extremely vicious. Therefore, he asked the court to severely punish the unrepentant and vicious criminals. Judge Jiang ordered that the defendant be remanded in custody pending sentencing.</p>
<h3>Two Workers Joking, One Elderly Man Dies Tragically; A Violent Collision Causes Him to Fall onto a Giant Log; The Perpetrator Flees and Disappears</h3>
<p>Pan Rongzu, a 60-year-old resident of No. 5 Yuanfang Lane, Yuanfang Road, worked at the Jardine Wharf to make a living. At approximately 11:00 AM on the previous afternoon, Pan and his colleague, Chen Weifu, were standing on the edge of the wharf, watching the Huangpu River. Two other workers, who also had no work to do, were joking around. One of them ran ahead, and the other chased closely behind. As they passed where Pan and the others were standing, they accidentally bumped into the elderly man violently, causing him to fall onto a giant log eight feet below the wharf. He was seriously injured and barely breathing. Chen reported the incident to the nearby guard at No. 3030, who telephoned the Hongkou Police Station. The worker who caused the accident had already fled and disappeared. The police summoned an ambulance and rushed the elderly man to the Tongren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective and he soon died. The police station dispatched detectives to investigate the incident and transported the body to the autopsy center on Fearon Road. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, was appointed to examine the body. According to the detectives, they were still investigating the case. Chen Weifu and the deceased's son were summoned to the center for questioning this morning, but they had not yet arrived. Tang then ruled that the deceased, Pan Rongzu, was a male who died from injuries sustained in a fall during his lifetime. The two unknown workers are suspected of causing death by negligence and should be investigated by the relevant police station according to the law. The body was temporarily handed over to the Pushan Villa for burial.</p>
<h3>A Murder Case Resulting from Exchanging Beef Buns; Verdict Rendered Yesterday; Shi Yushan Sentenced to Twelve Years</h3>
<p>Sun Wenqing, an apprentice from Nanyang Paper Box Factory living at No. 12 Jinyu Lane, Minti Ni Yin Road, South Chu's Home Bridge in the French Concession, went to Yumeiju Mosque Restaurant opened by Shi Yushan from Baoding at No. 59 and 61 Pishaonai Road to buy four beef buns for supper at about 7:00 PM on the 11th of last month. He felt that the meat filling in the buns was still raw, so he went to Yumeiju to exchange them. Sun accidentally dropped the buns on the ground, and one of them was already bitten and dirty. The shop refused to exchange them, which led to an argument. The shop workers then slapped Sun's face. In desperation, Sun picked up a stone and threw it into the shop. The shop workers then accused Sun of throwing meat skin into the shop, which defiled the rules of the Qingzhen sect, and reported it to the shop owner, Shi Yushan (47 years old this year). Shi then took a beef knife and, together with his shop workers, went to the Nanyang Paper Box Factory to argue with the factory owner, Yang Kunsheng. Shi then violently stabbed Yang three times in the back, and he died that night due to serious injuries after failing to respond to medical treatment. The mountain police dispatched detectives Xu Guilin and Xu Jinlong to arrest the murderer Shi Yushan and his suspected accomplices, Jia Jinshou, Wang Sandanzi, and apprentice Shi Shengzhen. They recovered a murder weapon, a beef knife, and a piece of pig ear. They were sent to the Second Special Court. The lawyer from the Mountain Police Department filed a public prosecution for murder under Article 282 of the Criminal Law. The victim's widow, Yang Chen, also hired a lawyer to file a private lawsuit, seeking damages of 40 yuan per month for 15 years until her son came of age, totaling 7,700 yuan, plus 500 yuan for funeral expenses. Judge Li Changnian held several hearings and concluded the case, setting a date for sentencing. This has been reported in previous issues. Yesterday was the sentencing date. At 10:00 AM, Judge Li, accompanied by clerks Wang Baoxun and Feiguan, went to the First Criminal Court and ordered the accused, Shi, to be brought to the case. After briefly questioning his age and origin, he announced the verdict: Shi Yushan was sentenced to 12 years of imprisonment for murder, with 12 years of deprivation of civil rights. The number of days of detention before the verdict was determined, with two days deducted for one day of imprisonment, and he was ordered to compensate Yang Chen 1,200 yuan. Jia Jinshou, Wang Sandanzi, and Shi Shengzhen were found not guilty. After the verdict, he briefly explained the meaning of the verdict to Shi, saying that he should have been sentenced to death or life imprisonment for the crime of murder, but considering that pork was found in his shop, and the crime was committed under provocation, he was given a lighter sentence. If he disagreed with the verdict, he could submit a written appeal to the High Second Branch Court within 10 days of receiving the verdict. After the announcement, the accused were taken to the detention center pending further instructions during the appeal period.</p>
<h3>Woman Wang Yulan Appeals Against University Student; Defendant Claims Plaintiff is a Prostitute; Hearing Concluded Yesterday, Verdict to be Announced on the 18th</h3>
<p>Wang Yulan, a 23-year-old woman from Tianjin residing at No. 5 Pingle Lane, Xizang Road, previously hired a lawyer to file a private lawsuit with the First Special Court, accusing Sun Shanfu, a university student, of seduction and embezzlement of jewelry. The initial trial declared Sun not guilty and dismissed the plaintiff's incidental civil suit. This has been reported in this newspaper. Wang Yulan, dissatisfied with the verdict, hired a lawyer to appeal to the High Second Branch Court. Yesterday afternoon, Criminal Court President Yu Hua, accompanied by judges Zhou and Xiao, held a hearing. The appellant, Wang Yulan, wearing a dark-colored short-sleeved silk qipao and high-heeled leather shoes, with her hair curled loosely, arrived on time with her lawyer. The appellee, Sun Shanfu, in a suit and shoes, stood calmly in the defendant's dock. Wang Yulan claimed that she met Sun in Dachong Lane, Tongfu Road, and because Sun claimed to be a student of her father, they began to talk and exchanged information about their families. After that, they began to visit each other, and their relationship became close. Sun then expressed that he was still single and wanted to marry her, and she was deceived by his sweet words. She went to a hotel with him and shared a room. Later, she rented a room above a tailor shop in Fuzhi Lane, Sima Road, and lived with him. At that time, she was also deceived out of gold chains, gold rings, and other jewelry, which he falsely claimed to store in a safe deposit box, and gave her a seal, saying that she could use it to withdraw the items in the future. At that time, because she was already in a husband and wife relationship with the defendant, not only the jewelry, but also her body belonged to Sun, so she did not suspect anything. Unexpectedly, Sun later changed his attitude and treated her like worn-out shoes. All the jewelry was swallowed up. Although she and Sun were not married, they were engaged, with a joint photo as proof. Now, she was dissatisfied with the original trial's verdict of not guilty, so she appealed. Questioned, Sun Shanfu confessed that after he met Wang in the New World Amusement Park, he knew that she was a woman in the flower industry. He went to the Luolan Spring House and Li Wei's Houses on Shantou Road to work as a prostitute, and later transferred to Rongfang and Chen Yumei's Houses in Fuxiang Lane. He often went to the collection bureau and invited friends to help, offering wine as a reward, costing no less than a thousand gold. Later, he had a room together in the Nanjing Hotel, but there was no intention to marry her or embezzle jewelry. The court verified the confessions and then ordered the debate to begin. The lawyers of both parties concluded the debate. The court announced that the verdict would be announced on the afternoon of the 18th.</p>
<h3>Kuang Jinbao and Others Forced a Woman into Prostitution; Imprisoned in a Hotel and Deprived of Freedom; Police Investigation Leads to Rescue</h3>
<p>Xue San'nan, a 22-year-old woman from Suzhou, had long been betrothed to someone in her hometown. On the fifth day of the fifth lunar month of this year, she was about to get married. However, Xue had a secret relationship with Kuang Jinbao from Danyang. Now, lured by Kuang, on the pretext of introducing her to work in Shanghai, Kuang and his friend Zhou Lao San took her to Shanghai on the seventh of this month. They initially lived in the Wulin Hotel, where Xue was kept under strict surveillance. Whenever Kuang and Zhou went out, they would lock the door and confine Xue inside. The day before yesterday, they sent Xue to Ma Afu, a Zhenjiang native who ran a brothel at No. 18 Xinzha Road, forcing her to become a prostitute. This was investigated by Chief Inspector Feng Zhiming and Detective Wu Hanzhang of the General Inspectorate. They first arrested Kuang and Zhou on North Zhejiang Road, and then went to No. 18 Xinzha Road at about 10:00 PM that night to arrest Ma and rescue Xue. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the First Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the case and said that before the police officers went to rescue her, Ma Afu had already applied makeup to Xue and forced her to go out to receive customers. As soon as she went out the door, she informed the patrol officers, so she returned. Currently, the police have temporarily filed charges under Articles 315 and 316 of the Criminal Law. However, according to the police investigation, Kuang and Zhou lured another woman from Suzhou to Shanghai besides Xue, but the whereabouts of the other woman have not yet been found. Therefore, the two cases were adjourned to allow time for further investigation. Xue San'nan then testified about her experience of being lured. Judge Feng Shide verified the confessions and briefly questioned the three defendants, ordering them to wait for a further hearing. The defendants were remanded in custody, and Xue San'nan was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute for care.</p>
<h3>Announcement of the Results of the YMCA Membership Drive</h3>
<p>The Shanghai YMCA's 35th membership drive concluded at 10:00 PM on the 10th. The 40 teams raised a total of 70,009 points, exceeding the original target by more than 10,000 points. Four teams exceeded the target by more than 80%. The results were more than 4,500 points higher than last year's, breaking the YMCA's previous membership drive record. The reasons are: (1) All 40 team leaders and members were youth leaders with high morale; (2) Due to the economic recession, each team worked harder; (3) The YMCA's recruitment strategy this year was defensive and offensive, and there was sufficient preparation. In order to concentrate efforts, the time was shortened to only one-third of previous years. Captain Kong's support was particularly strong. On the evening of the 10th, he frequently inquired about the evening's situation by phone. His concern can be imagined.

<h3>The Second Special Court's Detained Prisoners Resisted Transfer to Prison - Each Prisoner Stubbornly Protested, Injured Guards, Cut Skin with Broken Porcelain Pieces to Collude</h3>
<p>The detention center of the Second Special District Court is overcrowded due to its narrow location. Therefore, a portion of the buildings in the Second Special District Prison on Route Masenan were used as the East Section to house serious criminals. Ten prisoners, including Wang Guinian, Qi Xingshun, Chen Xiaoyi, Liu Quansheng, Zhang Jinding, Lu Sanxi, Yao Changshou, Xue Hongqing, Xu Debiao, and Li Zhendian, were sentenced by the Second Special Court to imprisonment ranging from two to nine years for crimes such as theft, robbery, murder, and stealing. Because these prisoners disagreed with the verdicts, they appealed to the Second and Third Instance courts and the Supreme Court. They were therefore detained in cells 1, 2, 3, and 4 of the East Section of the detention center. At 5:30 PM on the 9th, Director Bai Caiwen entered the prison and ordered the prisoners to move to the West Section (i.e., the courtroom of the Second Special Court) and live in separate cells. Unexpectedly, the prisoners stubbornly resisted and refused, starting a commotion, shouting and causing an uproar. The Director immediately reported to Sun Xiong, the Director of the Second Special Prison, who also served as the Warden of the detention center, to investigate. All the prisoners disobeyed and dared to attack Sun with glass bottles. At that time, Zhang He, a guard from the Second Special Prison, was nearby and, seeing the situation was bad, immediately stepped forward to protect Sun, shielding the Warden with his body to prevent him from being hit and injured. Zhang's right leg was cut and bled by a shard of glass. Sun immediately summoned the prison guard team to suppress the prisoners. Wang Guinian, Qi Xingshun, and Chen Xiaoyi, seeing the situation escalate, smashed their rice bowls and used the broken pieces to cut their heads or foreheads in an attempt to resist. At this time, Chen Beisan, the Chief Prosecutor of the Second Special Court, had finished his official duties and returned home, but rushed to investigate upon hearing the news. Unexpectedly, the prisoners all claimed that they had been dragged out by the guards and beaten with wooden sticks. They continued to shout and could not be stopped. Chen Beisan ordered the prisoners to be shackled and also asked a forensic doctor to examine the three prisoners' wounds caused by porcelain shards and reported the incident to the nearby police station, dispatching a large number of detectives to the prison to interrogate the prisoners. The next day (the 10th) at 5:00 PM, the prisoners were sent back to the detention center. The prisoners then caused a commotion under the pretext that they had not eaten dinner. It stopped for a while. Until 9:00 AM yesterday morning, the prisoners were restless again because their breakfast was late. After being stopped, the Warden transferred the ten prisoners to the Procuratorate of the Second Special Court to investigate. Chief Prosecutor Chen Beisan, accompanied by Clerk Zhao, specially opened an interrogation court. First, the injured guard Zhang He reported that the prisoners had committed violence, resisted, and attempted to attack the Warden, and he was injured while trying to save him. Then, the prisoners were interrogated separately and had all colluded. Wang, Qi, and Chen all claimed that they had been beaten by the guards with wooden sticks. The other seven prisoners, including Liu Quansheng, also claimed that they had seen the guards drag the prisoners to the courtyard and beat them. They all claimed that after being sent back by the police station, they were not given dinner, and this morning's breakfast was too late, so they argued. During the interrogation, the prisoners still appeared arrogant, with a fearless attitude that was chilling. Finally, Warden Wen Dian of the detention center was interrogated about the circumstances of the incident. The prosecutor ordered the prisoners to be detained again for further investigation. When the bailiffs took the prisoners out of the court and back to the detention center, some even incited a hunger strike to exert pressure.</p>

<h3>Mady Employee Acquitted of Towing Vehicle - Buyer Paid in Installments, Defaulted, Company Entitled to Recover, No Guilt</h3>
<p>Ma Shiqi, residing at No. 1, Yuansheng Lane, No. 93, Route Pishaune, French Concession, previously purchased a vehicle with license plate number 6886 from Mady Motor Company at No. 80, Avenue Edouard VII, for a price of 4,702 taels, with payment to be made in installments. The contract stated, "If payment is not made by the due date, Mady Company may, without legal procedures, tow the vehicle back at any time." Subsequently, in addition to the paid car price, Ma had three installments, totaling over 600 yuan, outstanding. The manager of the company ordered four employees, Feng Xiangsheng, Shu Shangli, Shi Wenyuan, and Ling Renjie, to go to Ma's residence in Yuansheng Lane on the 31st of last month to tow the car back. Ma's driver, Meng Shuilong, spotted them and grabbed them, accusing them of theft and calling the police to arrest them and take them to the Second Special Court, where they were prosecuted for theft under Article 338 of the Criminal Code. After two trials, the plaintiff, Ma Shiqi, stated that the defendants did not commit theft. They were employees of Mady Motor Company, it was a misunderstanding, and he requested that they be released from prosecution. When questioned, Feng Xiangsheng and others testified that they were ordered by the manager of the company to recover the car and were not committing theft. Attorney Eson also argued that the theft charge filed by the police was difficult to sustain, the plaintiff did not wish to prosecute, and the defendants should be acquitted. Judge Sun Penghou concluded the debate and acquitted Feng Xiangsheng, Shu Shangli, Shi Wenyuan, and Ling Renjie the morning before yesterday.</p>

<h3>Mars is Closest to Earth Today - Astronomers Around the World Observe Mars for Signs of Humans, Chinese Observatories Lack Equipment for Better Results</h3>
<p>Of the planets in the solar system, Mars is closest to Earth. Today is one of the closest days in recent years when Mars is closest to Earth because it is the perihelion of Mars today. The distance between Earth and Mars is about 156 million li, but today it is about 80 million li, almost half the distance. Although opinions are not completely consistent on whether there are humans on Mars and what the level of evolution of Martian humans is, the majority opinion believes that there are indeed humans on Mars and their culture is very advanced. Marconi, the inventor of radio, believes that the inexplicable electrical waves often felt on the radio station originate from Mars. Therefore, astronomers from various countries will gather at well-equipped observatories today to observe Mars in order to see if there are humans. However, the equipment of Chinese observatories is not sufficient to obtain better results.</p>

<h3>Letter to the Editor</h3>
<p>Having recently read a news item in your esteemed newspaper of April 10th, stating, "Dredging the Wusong River will be done with dredgers, and upon the arrival of the construction equipment, the dam will be opened, restoring navigation," etc. After investigation, the dredging project of the Yuji Mound section of the Wusong River had been previously decided upon, and the dam was closed for construction on April 1st. Subsequently, upon receiving a telegram from the Shanghai Municipal Government stating that dam closure and excavation could not accommodate both water transport and involved various obstructions, this committee submitted a request to the National Economic Council to switch to dredgers for excavation. Although part of the original dam construction work has been completed, it has not yet been fully closed, and boat traffic continues as usual without obstruction. The aforementioned news item is likely a result of hearsay. I am accordingly writing to request verification and correction to avoid misunderstandings, and to maintain our public relations. Respectfully addressed to Shen Bao, Taihu Basin Water Conservancy Committee.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Holding Buddha)</p>
<p>It is common for people to forget the good deeds done for them but remember the bad. Resentment lingers in the heart, while gratitude fades like clouds. This is why "returning evil for good" is so prevalent.</p>
<p>Regardless of how others treat me, whether harshly or kindly, I will interpret it with good intentions, so that my heart is at peace and there is no resentment.</p>
<p>I often see people overjoyed and moved to tears when their desires are fulfilled. But as soon as their wishes are slightly thwarted or their desires denied, resentment arises, and they spare no effort in slander and defamation. The psychology of petty people is generally like this.</p>
<p>When talking to others, they only think of themselves, speaking endlessly about their own matters while disregarding what others say. They even interrupt before others finish speaking. There are many such people in society, a clear demonstration of "self-centeredness."</p>
<p>Words are the voice of the heart. Those who slander me are frightening, but those who praise me are also dangerous. Those who remain silent are often resented, while those who talk too much are often hated. Humble words can inflate the ego of petty people, while arrogant words can elicit dissent from gentlemen. Careless words can ruin affairs and even lead to death. Alas, how difficult it is to speak!</p>
<h3>The Life of Liberated Women</h3>
<p>— Zhou Xian</p>
<p>This is a description of a certain Miss's life on a certain day.</p>
<p>She wakes up yawning at eleven in the morning. Ah Jin, who serves her, prepares her bath while telling her that Mr. Yang is waiting in the drawing-room and inviting her out for a fancy meal.</p>
<p>She nods, slips on her high-heeled slippers, goes to the bathroom to take a bath, hurriedly does her hair, applies powder, and puts on lipstick. After a flurry of activity, she throws on a newly made spring coat, puts on high heels, and rushes downstairs. She smiles sweetly at Mr. Yang and nestles close to him, getting into Mr. Yang's big-butt car.</p>
<p>Coming out of the Western restaurant, it's already one-thirty. Mr. Yang drops her off at the club and goes to the office himself.</p>
<p>She plays eight rounds of cards at the club. The sky gradually darkens, and then Mr. He invites her to dinner.</p>
<p>After dinner, Mr. He hosts a trip to a certain grand theater to see Hollywood's newly completed 1935 romance film.</p>
<p>After watching the movie, Mr. He pulls her to a certain dance hall.</p>
<p>Stepping into the dance hall, she sees at a glance Mr. Zhang, Mr. Shen, Mr. Yu, Mr. Xu, and a dozen other boyfriends whose names she can't recall for the moment, scattered in groups of two or three inside. As soon as they see her come in, they all rush over to greet her.</p>
<p>The music starts, and all those who know her ask her to dance. So she takes turns dancing with each acquaintance once.</p>
<p>By twelve o'clock, she feels a little tired. So she throws on her coat and daintily steps out of the dance hall, hires a taxi and returns home.</p>
<p>Again, Ah Jin, who serves her, serves her with a bath. She sits at her writing desk and begins to cut open, one by one with scissors, the dozen or so letters from her boyfriends on the desk. After looking through them, she quickly picks up her fountain pen and replies to each one. Some even include a photo.</p>
<p>Once the work is finished, it is four o'clock in the morning. She yawns, stretches, and mumbles as she goes to bed, "This damn socializing is killing me."</p>
<h3>Talking About Surnames</h3>
<p>— Liu Xunwei</p>
<p>The other day I saw an article in "Spring and Autumn" by Wan Jun listing strange surnames, followed by a continuation by Gong Jun, mostly rare surnames, which aroused considerable interest. However, many of the surnames in both articles are found in the "Hundred Family Surnames." Now, based on my knowledge, there are several surnames that are not in the "Hundred Family Surnames" and were not mentioned by either writer, which I would like to discuss.</p>
<p>(火) In Shanghai, there is a writer named Huo Xueming. At the same time, in my hometown of Funing, there is a store called Huo Guangfu, and the owner is called Huo Qingquan. (還) In my hometown, there is a poor man called Hai You Neng. He is already old! His wife is still alive, and we all call him Old Hai. (曇) I had a history and geography teacher who said that when he was studying at Central University, he had a very close friend whose surname was the "曇" in "昙花一现" (ephemeral), and his given name was Qicai, from Liaoning. (裔) In Gangmen, Yancheng, there are many people with the surname Yi. During the Qing Dynasty, there was Yi Buluan who was a secretary in the Ministry of Personnel. In our town, there is Yi, named Yi, who was a student in the Qing Dynasty. (薩) Currently, there is a naval admiral in Fujian named Sa Zhenbing. We know that there was a famous poet in the Yuan Dynasty named Sa Dula. (環) I have a relative who used to know someone in Zhenjiang whose surname was Huan, and his given name was Jiren. (保) The surname Bao is a prominent family in Nantong, and many distinguished figures emerged during the imperial examination era. (眭) A shop owned by my family had a relief guest several years ago called Sui Boming, who was from Zhenjiang. (諶) There is a well-known person in Suzhou called Chen Zegao. The editor of the Labor Quarterly is called Chen Xiaocen. (　) I had a female classmate, who was both before and after me, called Mao Guzhen. (過) The head of the mail order department of Sanyou Industrial Society is called Guo Muqian. (邸) I recently met a cousin of a classmate surnamed Yin, called Di Xiang. (樓) There is a special writer for The Future Magazine called Lou Tongsun. (畝) There is Mu Dongting in the seventh issue of Art Life. (掌) There are many people in my hometown with the surname Zhang. There is Zhang Mumin, who is currently a writer for the National Defense Forum. (菱) There is a frequent contributor to this newspaper called Linghu Zhao. (浦) There is a contemporary writer called Pu Xuefeng. Other rare surnames include Nong, as in Nong Zhigao, the Guangxi rebel who attacked Kunlun during the Lantern Festival in the story of Di Qing. There are probably many uncommon surnames! There have always been many surnames in China, and many do not share ancestry even with the same surname. Only the descendants of Confucius and the descendants of the warlord Xiang Yu are not mixed. It is said, "There are no two Kongs under heaven" and "There are no two Xiangs under heaven," so they are all one family under heaven! But whether this is accurate remains to be investigated.</p>

<h3>Typos and Plagiarism</h3>
<p>— (Zheng Yimei)</p>
<p>Typos and plagiarism are considered a great disgrace by us scholarly friends. Especially when submitting articles, those riddled with typos naturally have no hope of being accepted. And "Plagiarists, please do not bother," is clearly stated in the rules for submissions. Even if the editor is momentarily deceived, it is difficult to escape the sharp eyes of the readers. Reporting plagiarism and publishing it in the newspaper makes the offender feel ashamed and unable to try again. But there are two kinds of people in society who are promoting typos and plagiarism. One is doctors. Doctors often use typos when writing prescriptions. Even Confucian doctors invariably mix in typos. Hence, there is a saying of "medicinal typos." For example, "枳殼" (zhi ke) is written as "只壳" (zhi ke), "茈胡" (chai hu) as "柴胡" (chai hu), "厚樸" (hou po) as "厚朴" (hou po), "黃蘗" (huang bo) as "黃拍" (huang pai), and so on, endlessly. Isn't that promoting typos? The other is painters. Whether painting landscapes, figures, or flowers, they always write "imitating Shigu," "copying Laolian," "reproducing Shouping," etc. Even if they have never seen the works of Shigu, Laolian, or Shouping in their lives, they can still write it randomly to show that their painting has a provenance. Isn't that promoting plagiarism? No one dares to criticize or report these kinds of typos and plagiarism. Sacred - typos, sacred! Plagiarism.</p>

<h3>Impressions of the New Italy</h3>
<p>— Shu</p>
<p>Before the revolution, Italy's corruption was similar to that of China, perhaps even more thorough. However, within a few years, it was able to completely wash away old habits and strive to become a powerful nation. Its policies have attracted considerable attention in our country, and the relationship between China and Italy has gradually become closer. In the past, our country fell for the lure of "alliance with Russia," resulting in countless communists. Currently, fascism is naturally more appealing to China, so books discussing fascism have become timely commodities. Some translate old Western books, while others rely on hearsay, both of which can win the favor of readers. However, Italy's policies are progressing daily, and the translations are of stories from years or even decades ago. What is said here is not found in other books and is based on my own observations, so it is somewhat more up-to-date.</p>
<p>Although Italy is small and crowded, it does not promote birth control but rather encourages childbirth. The more children a family has, the more it is treated favorably by the government. Besides receiving a bonus from the government when a child is born, the government also provides monthly subsidies. At the same time, parents are also given considerable encouragement. Whether buying goods or riding in vehicles, they can pay discounted prices. A family of eight can ride boats and vehicles completely free of charge. This is the opposite of the prevailing practice of birth control and infanticide in our society. Population is a nation's resource. It is universally known that a nation cannot become prosperous and strong without encouraging childbirth.</p>
<p>The government provides all citizens with subsidies in addition to salaries, the amount depending on the size of their rank, similar to the system in our country during the monarchy, where those with achievements could receive stipends. Therefore, even when unemployed, they remain loyal to the government and never rebel. The minimum subsidy is sufficient to maintain a family after unemployment. Therefore, no citizen in Italy would commit suicide by drowning or go astray due to unemployment.</p>
<p>The call for gender equality is louder in our country than in any other civilized nation, but in reality, there are many contradictions, and fairness is not seen. In Italy, the government reviews all marriages. If the man's economic status is not very affluent, the woman must have a sufficient dowry before the marriage is approved, to compensate for the lack of income. This would certainly not work in China, but it is not an unfair example of gender equality. If a woman can rely on a man, then a man can also rely on a woman when his income is meager.</p>
<p>Elementary and primary schools do not charge tuition, and other fees are minimal. Any poor child can attend school, and their education can naturally develop. In our country, private schools charge exorbitant fees, which cannot be afforded by middle and lower-class families, resulting in most children not attending school and the people's knowledge being shallow. No wonder they do not know what is meant by nation or country.</p>
<p>I sincerely hope that the authorities can adopt good systems in the future to reform education and maintain the people's livelihood, especially focusing on practicality and not just wasting money on superficial construction.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Eleven: The Night Talk of a Miserable Life is but a Dream / The Footprints are Scattered and the Wind and Rain are Too Deceitful</p>
<p>But this courtyard is full of floating mud, trampled by these busy people, leaving shoe prints of various sizes and depths everywhere. The brick path is indistinguishable among the many shoe prints, so how can one walk? Seeing that woman stagger out earlier was already pitiful. Yet he himself was still very happy. Now, Zhu Yueying follows behind them, her eyebrows tightly furrowed, her face full of embarrassment. Although he is watching the ground carefully as he walks, he pauses with each step, as if reluctant to move forward. Because his spirit is not focused, his feet do not feel solid on the ground. A gust of wind comes and wraps up his umbrella and his clothes, and he cannot help but lean with the wind. As his body leans to the left, his feet must brace to the right to steady himself. He does not know that the mud underfoot cannot bear any force. The more force he applies, the more the floating mud will slide. Yueying has no control. Do man and umbrella tumble into the mud together? Zhixian, upon seeing this, exclaims in alarm. Hu's wife and Yang Huanhua are startled by this exclamation and turn their heads. Hu's wife has bound feet and can barely take care of herself, so she cannot help anyone. Yang Huanhua is holding an umbrella and cannot free a hand, so she can only stare at the girl in the mud.

<h3>The Scented Mists of the Imperial Palace</h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Roughly, the height of this piece of wood is between three and five inches. At the same time, one must take care not to make it too thick and clumsy, but must make it very light. On the shoes worn by the Empress Dowager and other noble women, this piece of wood must be carefully decorated. The most common decoration is to insert pieces of colored glass around the wood, and some hemp or yarn must be used to wrap it tightly to prevent it from falling off. When the sunlight shines on it, it will glitter and shine. People who see it will think that they are stepping on a heel carved from jewels! But this is not easy to see, because the heel is always under people's feet and is not very high, so it is not often exposed to sunlight. The bottom of the heel is wrapped with layers of cotton cloth, nailed with small nails or sewn with strong leather thread. This way, it will not make annoying noises when walking. This method is the same as the rubber heels nailed on modern leather shoes, but it is not as durable.</p>
<p>In addition to the heel, attention must be paid to the shoe itself! The shoe itself is divided into the sole and the upper. The manufacture of the sole is very simple, just like the cloth-soled shoes worn by women in China. Or, a thin piece of wood is shaved and wrapped with layers of cloth to replace the ordinary cloth sole. This need not be described in detail. The construction of the upper is extraordinary! There are hundreds of styles, the most common being the flying phoenix style and the plum blossom shape. I cannot list all the other more special styles. (291)</p>

<h3>Fourth Day of the National Reading Movement / Cai Yuanpei Speaks on How to Study Philosophy / Tao Baichuan Will Broadcast on How to Study Party Doctrine Today at 3:15 PM on the Central-Western Radio Station</h3>
<p>The National Reading Movement Conference, organized by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association, was held for the fourth day yesterday. The Association specially invited Cai Yuanpei, President of the Academia Sinica, to speak on "How to Study Philosophy" on the Central-Western Radio Station. Today, at 3:15 PM, Tao Baichuan will be invited to speak on how to study Party Doctrine. The full text of Mr. Cai's speech is recorded below.</p>
<p>The Scope of Philosophy: If we want to study philosophy, we must first examine the scope of philosophy. Philosophy is derived from religion. When religion flourished, it made dogmatic explanations of natural phenomena and human behavior, allowing only faith and not doubt. Later, doubters emerged, taking a semi-detached or completely detached attitude from religion, attempting to provide explanations that did not have to be the same as religion. This is the beginning of philosophy. At the beginning of philosophy, it took on the responsibility of explaining both natural phenomena and human behavior. Figures such as Aristotle in Greece and Bacon in England were like this. This was when philosophy had its widest scope. Later, sciences explaining natural phenomena gradually came into being, such as physics, chemistry, geology, astronomy, zoology, botany, etc. As a result, the scope of philosophy was reduced. Later, sciences explaining human behavior, such as history, sociology, linguistics, politics, law, etc., also gradually came into being. As a result, the scope of philosophy was reduced again. Finally, psychology became an independent science through the application of experimental methods. Pedagogy and aesthetics followed, and there was also a tendency for them to become experimental sciences. Ethics can be tried with inductive methods, so the scope of philosophy became even smaller.</p>
<p>Philosophy and Science: Although the scope of philosophy has gradually shrunk due to the emergence of science, the relationship between philosophy and science has become increasingly close. Although the initial construction of science was limited to small tests and comparisons, as it developed, the accumulated principles increased. If one wanted to construct a consistent theory, it would often involve the philosophical field. Therefore, there are philosophies of a single science, such as the philosophy of mathematics and the philosophy of law. There is also philosophy that integrates the natural sciences, such as natural philosophy, and there are philosophies that integrate the natural sciences and social sciences to form a system, such as Spaventa's integrative philosophy and Comte's empirical philosophy. As for pure metaphysicians, they seem to transcend science. However, Bergson, who constructed metaphysics through intuition, repeatedly spoke of the drawbacks of over-emphasizing the intellect, but the examples he cited were still taken from science. This shows the close connection between philosophy and science.</p>
<p>Methods of Study: As for how to start studying philosophy, as Mr. Ye Qing said, it is best to first read introductions to philosophy and histories of philosophy. After reading these books, you will know a little about the outline of philosophy and the schools of previous philosophers. If you find a particular school especially to your liking, you can collect books from that school and read them in detail. If you don't find any school satisfactory, you can read a more detailed history of philosophy to arouse your interest. As for the scope of study, you don't have to be too rigid. If you have a special strength in a certain science, you can start from there, as Darwin proceeded from biology and Russell proceeded from mathematics. If you have no particular interest in any of the sciences, you can proceed from philosophy, dividing it into broad and narrow approaches. A broad approach considers all aspects, as Wundt wrote books on logic, ethics, psychology, and other ethnic psychology, and introductions to philosophy. Cohen wrote on pure cognitive logic, pure volitional ethics, and pure emotional aesthetics. A narrow approach focuses on one aspect, such as Locke's focus on epistemology and Croce's focus on aesthetics. In short, the subject of study can be freely determined and is not subject to any restrictions, etc.</p>
<h3>Dr. Monroe Talks About the Revival of Chinese Culture: Still Searching for Itself Politically and Culturally — World Higher Education Should Be Flexible and Focus on Practicality</h3>
<p>According to the "China Press," Dr. Monroe, an American educator and vice-chairman of the China Education and Culture Fund Board of Directors, arrived in Shanghai on the "Canada Maru" a few days ago. The Fund is scheduled to hold its annual meeting in Shanghai on the 19th of this month to discuss the allocation and use of the second half of the Boxer Indemnity refunded by the United States. Yesterday (the 10th), Dr. Monroe discussed with guests what he called "the most meaningful movement" in our new era: the emergence and revival of Eastern culture, and its ability to express its reality in the countries where it originated. He stated that he believes China has not yet found itself politically and culturally. Once China finds itself in these aspects, those of us in the West will be willing to pay it the same attention as we do to Japan and Russia, both of which are now respected as world powers. Dr. Monroe also mentioned that the close relationship between China and the United States in education has unfortunately gradually become estranged. The number of Chinese students studying in the United States has decreased, and the funds used by the United States for foreign students (including some Chinese students) have also been reduced. Although American attention to Chinese educational institutions remains the same as before, the financial assistance provided has decreased. Part of the reason may be that American public sentiment believes that a country should manage its own cultural life without interference from others, leading to a decline in the enthusiasm for responding to calls for donations to Chinese education. However, the greater factor is undoubtedly the economic recession. Despite this, American attention to the East, especially China, has become more widespread than in the past. American schools have increased the number of courses related to Eastern culture, and some scholars are specializing in research in China and Japan, seeking to take on specialized positions in American schools in the future. The American Council of Learned Societies is one of the promoters of this movement, and it is particularly concerned about the development of such courses, hoping to include Far Eastern studies in the curriculum in the future, while the past curriculum was only related to Hebrew, Sanskrit, and Near Eastern issues. There is absolutely nothing wrong with the current eagerness of the East to emulate the West, but observing the current situation in China, it is possible to say that this is another manifestation of the revival of Chinese culture. This scene is only formed by combining the ideals and methods of the new era of politics and economics. The East has always believed in the truth of its own culture, but this culture must be modified to make it applicable to the new era of the world. The revival of Eastern culture is a fundamental fact, and there is irrefutable evidence of this in India, Arabia, Turkey, Russia, Japan, Persia, and China. This is promoted by the increasing convenience of Western new era travel methods, and as a result, one can see the accelerated pace of cultural development everywhere in the East. Dr. Monroe has authored many textbooks and history textbooks. When asked about his opinion on the issue of Chinese reprints of Western books, Dr. Monroe replied that if the rights of authors can be recognized, this would be a fair thing, but in practice, there are not many logical reasons to argue against it. The United States also used to reprint British books until the 19th century. In short, this is a complex issue.</p>
<p>Also, according to the Shanghai "Times," Dr. Monroe told guests the other day that in order to remedy the excessive production of students from world higher schools and universities, it is urgent to change educational methods to pay more attention to practical training. The future of young men and women graduating from higher schools and universities is particularly bleak. There is now a feeling of overproduction and underutilization of trained people all over the world. That is why in Germany alone, there are 130,000 graduates with doctoral degrees in philosophy who have nothing to do. This situation is now common throughout the world. In order to correct this irregularity, the number of students in higher schools should be reduced, and the subjects taught should be changed. Dr. Monroe believes that professions that are beneficial to individuals are not only beneficial to themselves but also helpful to society. Dr. Monroe firmly believes that the problem of middle schools and universities today is the selection of students with good aptitude, so that society can use the necessary money to develop their talents. Talent cannot be created by schools; schools can only train it based on its natural endowments. Dr. Monroe has visited China many times and flew to Peiping on Thursday to meet with other directors of the China Education and Culture Foundation. After returning to Shanghai, he is scheduled to give a speech at the Astor House Hotel on the 18th to members of the Pan-Pacific Association, titled "The Conflict Between American Politics and Economics." After participating in the China Foundation Board meeting from the 19th to the 21st, he plans to leave for Singapore and then fly back to Turkestan, where he has been the principal of the American Girls' High School for three years.</p>
<h3>Zhejiang Education Department Allocates Educational Funds for Disaster Areas: To Be Repaid in Installments Starting from Fiscal Year 24 in 53 Counties, Including Hangzhou County</h3>
<p>(Hangzhou Express News) The Zhejiang Provincial Department of Education, in order to provide relief to education in various counties in the province after the disaster, proposed to the Provincial Government Committee to allocate one million yuan of local public bonds from the province in the 23rd year to serve as an educational reserve fund. The regulations for the reserve fund were revised, promulgated and implemented. At the same time, a committee for reviewing educational funds for disaster areas was organized to review according to regulations. Subsequently, the review committee repeatedly held meetings to separately review and decide on the reported conditions of shortage of educational expenses and financial difficulties in various counties after the disaster, the number of income and expenditure budgets, and the situations where assistance should be provided. Fifty-three counties, including Hangzhou County, are proposed to be included in the first phase of allocation and loan. A list of county names and amounts is attached with explanations, along with the minutes of the meeting, and submitted to the Zhejiang Education Department for approval. It is reported that the department has now reviewed and approved it. The proposed amount of the first phase of allocation and loan and the repayment period have been listed and reported to the 751st meeting of the Zhejiang Provincial Government Committee for public decision and approval. Yesterday, a copy of the proposal and table, along with the official and duplicate impression formats, were sent to the governments of the 53 counties, including Hangzhou, for compliance and receipt, and repayment will begin in installments starting from the 24th fiscal year.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Education Fees Issued for Nearly Half a Month</h3>
<p>The payment notification for the second half of March expenses for Jiangsu Provincial Rural Normal School and Experimental Primary School (social education institutions, vocational schools, and normal schools are for the first half of March, and middle schools are for the second half of February) has been issued by the Jiangsu Education Fee Management Office to various institutions and schools in the past two days. The face value indicates maturity on the 15th of this month. It is reported that the Provincial Education Treasury has savings deposits that can be cashed with the ticket. It is also reported that the payment notification for the first half of April expenses for the Rural Normal School and Experimental Primary School (which can be extrapolated to other institutions and schools) has been signed separately at the auditor's meeting at the beginning of this month. After the payment is issued on the 15th, the schools can receive another half-month's expenses around the end of this month after the counties report and submit the education fees again.</p>
<h3>Implementation Measures for the Children's Year Have Been Finalized</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 11th) The entire plan for the implementation measures for the National Children's Year has been finalized by the Executive Yuan. The outline of the implementation measures has been greatly changed compared to the original plan submitted by the Ministry of Interior and Education. (1) General Principles; (2) Implementation Procedures, divided into (A) Preparatory Matters in April, May, June, and July of the 24th year, during which the National and Local Implementation Committees will be prepared and established by June 15; (B) Implementation Matters, from August of the 24th year to July of the 25th year, a certain number of implementation matters are stipulated for each month; (C) Conclusion Matters, to be completed in August, September, and November of the 25th year; (3) Supplementary Provisions, stipulating that local implementation committees should handle matters separately in accordance with the implementation procedures and local conditions. The funds are allocated by the Executive Yuan to the local areas, and by each province and city.</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Normal University Entrance Examination Chief Examiners Depart</h3>
<p>(Zhenjiang, 11th) The normal school entrance examination is scheduled to be held on the 15th. The chief examiners for each region have been assigned. Zhen Guanglang, Huang Hong, Ru Fang Guoren, Tong Pengda, Tong, held a discussion meeting at noon on the 11th to discuss matters related to the chief and invigilator examiners in each region. It is scheduled to depart successively starting on the 12th.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Promotes Local Education</h3>
<p>(Nanchang, 11th) In order to establish the foundation of education in the recovered counties and regions, the Provincial Government has specially formulated measures to promote local education and has ordered all counties to implement them earnestly.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Social Education Society Actively Promotes Social Education: Cultural Lectures Every Friday, Broadcasting Calligraphy Guidance, and Popular Lectures</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Social Education Society is a large group of social education workers in this city and from all over the country. Since its establishment, it has had more than 500 members. Recent work includes improving narrative circular pictures, reorganizing popular tunes, founding cultural lectures, planning for a popular library, and vocational training classes. It has made many contributions to social education in our country.</p>
<p>Cultural Lectures: In the past, in order to revive the national culture movement, the society held cultural lectures. The first phase invited Jiang Kanghu to lecture on Confucius's philosophy of life. Since the lectures began, it has been going on for May. Recently, the society has repeatedly received requests from the audience to increase the lecture time. After consultation with Mr. Jiang, it has been agreed that starting this Friday (tonight), on Friday afternoons from 7:30 PM to 8:30 PM, an additional lecture on the Analects will be given at the Citizen Education Center on Wenmiao Road. Those who have not received lecture certificates can obtain them from the society on Wenmiao Road. In order to leave a souvenir, it has been decided to invite all audience members and lecturers to take a group photo at the society at 10:00 AM on April 21. All audience members are welcome to participate.</p>
<p>Calligraphy Guidance: The society recognizes that the writing of a country represents the culture of a country. Although our country's writing has a special glory in the world, unfortunately, for thousands of years, not only have Chinese people doubted this writing of thousands of years, but also middle school or university graduates cannot write with a brush.

<p>Chairman's Report: After performing the ceremony, Director Pan of the Chairman reported that the 6th National Games will be held at the Municipal Sports Field in the city center this year. At the opening of the National Games on the Double Ten Festival, the organizing committee hopes that primary school students from this city will participate in the group performance, and after the organizing committee decided to use Tai Chi exercise, preparations are now starting. It is necessary to enable the students of the designated primary schools to perform Tai Chi exercise before the meeting. For the sake of consistency, a Tai Chi exercise teacher training class has been specially opened, designating physical education teachers from each school participating in the performance to attend the class, and inviting Chu Minyi, the inventor of Tai Chi exercise, to teach, training once a week, and will go to various primary schools to inspect, select a portion of students, but at least 5,000 people should participate in the performance, not only to make the exercise neat and uniform, but also to unite and focus, that each person can not be absent, and practice on time.</p>
<p>Chu's Speech: Next, Mr. Chu Minyi said briefly that the group performance at the opening of the National Games must have a solemn and neat expression. At the last National Games, there was also a Tai Chi exercise performance, with 2,360 participants, and the results were very good. This year, Shanghai is holding it, and if 5,000 people participate, it will be even more spectacular, giving Chinese and foreign audiences a good impression of the uniformity of primary school physical education. To make students uniform, we must first seek the uniformity of teachers. Therefore, this class was established.

A straight line is intermittent, while a circular line is continuous. Circular lines require less effort and have greater effects, and the direction is unlimited, left and right, forward and reverse, and can be used freely, but the joints are loose, the muscles are flexible, it is rational, not hard, strong or chaotic, the direction can be divided into six kinds: up, down, front, back, inside and outside, and the cutting surface has three kinds: plane, horizontal and longitudinal. You must first distinguish them. Chu then performed on the spot, and the spectators all praised and envied him.</p>

<h3>Securities 96 Bonds Plunge Below Ten Yuan Mark; Other Bonds Generally Rebound</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Securities Exchange market was not flat and firm. Because the fourth batch of repayments was due, colleagues have agreed to provide accommodation within the possible range. The future of credit is not expected to be overly tight, and public confidence has slightly strengthened. Sellers suddenly became scarce. However, due to the initial surge of selling of the 96 bonds after the fourth batch, followed by the release of the thirty-fifth batch, and then the dumping of the sixty-first batch, the market price fell again. The market price this month has even broken the ten yuan mark. The number of drastic declines is even greater than the fierce rise. It is rumored that most speculators have turned to short selling. The future situation is not yet easy to determine. Yesterday's market opened steadily and firmly, slightly recovering about a dime. The 96 bonds fell another two dimes due to the sale of the fourth batch this month. In the second session, the 21st bond was quite attractive, and the prices of various bonds continued to be firm, slightly better by five cents or a dime. The 96 bonds fell again by a dime and a half. In the afternoon session, the market was as stable as before. The 96 bonds fell another two and a half dimes due to the frenzy of selling of the thirty-fifth batch. At the close, the bulls on the trading floor slightly settled their positions, slightly weakening by about a dime. The 61st bond was sold out of the 96 bonds again, falling another one or two dimes. Throughout the day, the trend was firm and stable, with very little fluctuation. However, the decline of the 96 bonds did not stop, and the rapid fluctuations exhausted speculators. The final market prices generally rebounded from five cents to three dimes, except for the 96 bonds, which fell another six and a half dimes and four and a half dimes. The total transaction volume was 11,141,100 yuan. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton Market Lifeless; Sparse Trading; Market Prices Continue to Weaken</h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to weaken, and the situation feels increasingly weak. This is because the overseas cotton industry is turning downward, while spot yarn sales are stagnant. It seems that various guilds are saturated, so new buyers have disappeared, and the market shows a sluggish state. However, it is said that a certain bull is still holding tightly to the amount they have absorbed.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Steps Down: At the opening of the forward yarn market, all months showed a sluggish and weak appearance. Because American cotton fell slightly, and the market was bleak and lifeless. Both bulls and bears adopted a wait-and-see attitude. As a result, prices for each month fell by 1, 2, 3, and 4 dimes compared to the previous day's close. At the opening in the afternoon, the market condition felt even weaker. It was heard that spot yarn transactions were calm, overseas cotton industry news was not good, and third-grade yarn and cotton were declining. However, prices suddenly rose at the close, and cotton rebounded by 45 dimes. However, the selling pressure in the local market was not strong, transactions were sparse, and market price changes were not significant. As a result, each month fell by 2, 3, and 4 dimes compared to the morning close. It was found that 1,150 bales of Yongda were sold, 950 bales of Changfeng, 450 bales of Zhenda, 350 bales of Changyu, 250 bales of Xinhua, and 250 bales of Xinchang. 700 bales of Yida were bought, 450 bales of Ruida, 300 bales of Xiecheng, 500 bales of Hengchang, 300 bales of Junchang, 250 bales of Yuanda, and 250 bales of Jinchang.

<h3>Rumor Has It That Shorts Are Preparing to Deliver Coarse Cotton; This Month's Forward Cotton Market Shows Signs of Looseness</h3>
<p>The cotton market suddenly turned loose this month. According to market rumors, shorts are preparing to deliver coarse cotton, causing public sentiment to be flat, and floating longs have slightly sold out. The market has declined. At the same time, American cotton has also seen a decline. Spot cotton sales are sluggish, and various parties have sufficient cotton reserves, so the market pressure is still heavy.</p>
<p>Floating Longs Slightly Sell Out: At the opening of the forward cotton market, because American cotton had risen for three consecutive days, there was a clear trend of reaction and decline. The price of silver rose sharply, but the gold market fell slightly, and public sentiment was still maintained. New sellers in the market were still not enthusiastic, so the decline was still light. However, a certain foreign firm was still selling out. As a result, prices for each month fell by one dime to one dime and a half compared to the previous day's closing price. The market opened slightly empty in the afternoon. It was heard that the gold market continued to fall, and the overseas cotton news was not good. This month fell another dime and a half, and the far month fell by five cents. However, the overall situation was very depressed, but Shanghai's public sentiment was still stable.

<h3>American Cotton Market Fluctuations Are Uncertain</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened with lively conditions, each up 2 to 4 pound sounds. Subsequently, foreign brokers and colleagues, hoping for exemption from handling fees, and good results from the work relief regulations, bought in one after another, and market prices continued to be firm. After President Roosevelt announced at the press conference that work relief funds could not replace handling fees, bulls gradually turned to selling, and at the same time, New Orleans and Liverpool had sales, and prices softened. Although current demand is sluggish, the footing is still hard, and the close is flat. It is estimated that spot prices fell by 5 pound sounds, and futures fell by 3 to 6 pound sounds. After Senator Smith met with President Roosevelt and some senators, he stated that before Saturday, he would announce the continuation of the 1.2 cent loan for 1935. British cotton spot prices rose 4 points, and futures rose 45 points. Indian cotton was closed. The original telegraph record is on the left (10th telegram):</p>

<h3>Grains Recent Flour and Wheat Are Active and Trending Upward</h3>
<p>The flour market is quite tense due to active sales in the North. The near term is closer to the spot market, and the situation is even better. In addition to the Northern guilds loading spot flour, some are also dragging in near-month flour. After the opening of the far month in the morning, the market rose more than one point with the near month due to the large report of foreign wheat. In the afternoon, the weather cleared, and the mills set large positions, and the market returned to small. However, the near month was visited by actual sales, and the market was always bullish. The closing price for April was up 2.5 points, May was up 2 points, June and July were each up 2.5 points, August was unchanged, and September was down 0.5 points.</p>
<p>Yesterday, American wheat, Canadian wheat, and Canadian wheat telegrams were up 6, 7, and 8 points respectively. The atmosphere in the market was extremely good, and the prices of forward wheat for both near and far months rose across the board. The near term was more firm due to the lack of spot wheat. Because the weather had cleared and the merchants and vendors in the mainland were selling with the market, the market returned to small in the afternoon. As a result, the closing price for April was up 4 points, and July and August were only up 1 point each. September was down 1 point. Spot wheat mill offices are still active. Yesterday, 2,500 bags were opened, and the price rose another 2 or 3 points. High-quality wheat has reached 3.85 yuan, and the second-best is 3.82 yuan.</p>
<p>Chicago wheat: Due to Italy's large purchase today, the French government's estimate of winter wheat is 435,000,000 bushels, which is good for the bulls. The crop estimate in the countryside is about 93,000,000 bushels, compared to 116,000,000 bushels at the same time last year.</p>

<h3>Foreign Rice Inland Sales Not Declining; Local Rice Sales Are Sluggish</h3>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Inland shipments are still greedy. The local street and Yangtze River appetites have faded, but the inland offices of Jiangsu and Zhejiang are extremely strong. Yesterday, nearly 10,000 bags of Saigon small, Siamese high-quality and sub-quality rice were processed, and 2,500 bags of Saigon rice and 1,000 bags of Kaladi brown rice were processed, as well as 400 tons of Saigon small forward rice. The local street and other customers only processed 3,000 to 4,000 bags of Shangyang rice. Because of strong inland sales, the market rose gradually, and all types of rice continued to rise by 56 points. Foreign rice rose gradually by 67 points. Kaladi brown rice has not been traded for a long time. Yesterday, it was priced at 9.5 yuan due to inland popularity. Yesterday, only a thousand bags of Kexian rice were processed by inland offices, and the price remained stable.</p>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources of various gangs suddenly turned more abundant, with a total of about 40 numbers (nearly 8,000 stones of goods). The sales market in this street was normal, and the Ke Gang only felt that the Haiwei Gang processed more than 400 bags, so public sentiment was slightly soft, and the overall market gradually became tired. If the various thick japonica varieties are fixed except for high-quality materials, the spot goods in the market are all smaller than the various late rice prices, and the shaded and variable sales routes are also weak, and the market is also showing a soft trend.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 20 or 30 numbers of sources from various routes downstream. The transactions of various goods in the market were weak, and the market price of high-quality white japonica rice was a small number of points, and the price of middle and sub-quality goods fell by 12 points. The price of early thin rice was close to a corner, and other goods also showed a tired trend.</p>
<h3>The Reasons for the Brisk Sales and Weak Prices of Soybeans: Temporary Rush for Import Taxes in Guangdong</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean market was still stable. However, in terms of the sales market, the market trend must be viewed as bullish, but due to the implementation of increased import taxes in Guangzhou before the 21st, the sales of Guangzhou and Shantou were very smooth, so the holders took advantage of the rush of the two gangs to sell and liquidate their goods, which depressed the market atmosphere. Yesterday, the Guangzhou and Shantou gangs成交汉口迟豆卖出四千余包，四平街豆卖出十四五车，范家屯豆卖出十三四车，西城豆卖出二车，肥河豆卖出一车，内地，本街及油厂办事处办去颖州豆卖出三车，蚌埠豆卖出二车，毫州豆卖出三车，汉口乍豆卖出三百余包，以上各豆行情请看市价栏。</p>
<h3>Sugar Market Transactions in Chaozhou and Qingdao Increase Again Opening More Than 1,000 Bags</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market was active due to rising production prices and the rising rumors of additional taxes. As a result, people were unwilling to sell immediately, and the trend became tight. The guild's quotation for 24 coarse sand white was 17.8 yuan, and the resale price was 5.8 yuan. 89 red sugar was quoted at 13 yuan, and Taikoo Sugar B mark was quoted at 18.3 yuan. None of them were sold. The local factory's refined white Zhenyu No. 1 was 17.2 yuan, up a dime. The price of the second, third, and fourth grades was flat and the quotations for Chaozhou and Qingdao were fair and straightforward. Although the current purchasing power was not strong, the risk in the later market was very small, so the sentiment of the households was still strong. Yesterday, more than 1,000 bags were sold in total, including Huanggang Qing at 10.45 yuan, Gao Banan Qing at 9.8 yuan to 9.8 yuan, Huilai Qing at 9.7 yuan to 9.7 yuan, and Long Qing at 9.6 yuan to 9.5 yuan. Most of them were purchased by households, and the market was stable.</p>
<h3>North-South Goods Orchid Seeds Market Turns Loose</h3>
<p>Recently, there have been a few continued arrivals of orchid seeds, but goods that are completely yellow and shiny with a strong fragrance are completely missing. Most of the goods in stock are ordinary, so sales are returning and loosening, falling by one or two yuan compared to the high price. However, the number of inventories in the entire market is indeed limited, and the trend is stabilizing.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea Moroccan Green Tea Prices Fall</h3>
<p>The Moroccan green tea market has been quite sluggish recently. Because this year's imports of Luzhuang Zhenmei Pearl Tea are priced extremely low, the original tea in stock on the market has had to be forced to fall. According to reports from French tea merchants, the current price of Gaozhuang Zhenmei has fallen by 60 francs per kilo, Pearl Tea has fallen by 45 francs, and Needle Eyebrow and Show Eyebrow, etc., have also fallen by 30 francs. This market situation is quite unfavorable for the future of green tea this year.</p>
<h3>Metals White Iron Tile Sales Are Quite Brisk</h3>
<p>White iron tile transactions have been very active recently. Customers such as Tianjin, Yantai, Qingdao, and Xi'an are all buying, and the business of the construction gangs in the local street is also quite smooth, so the market situation is very good. Standard market prices are rising steadily due to shortages and thin inventories. For example, the estimated price of No. 24 is 11.56 yuan per dan (market dan), No. 26 is 12.5 yuan, and No. 28 is 13.34 yuan, all of which are better by two or three dimes compared to before. It is heard that there are even fewer spot goods of No. 24, so the sentiment of the holders is becoming more and more excellent, so the market situation is incomparable to other varieties. Due to the large number of Eastern goods arriving for No. 30, the market situation has not seen major ups and downs.</p>
<h3>Oil Market Tung Oil Plummeted and Then Slightly Rebounded</h3>
<p>After tung oil rose to 42 yuan in the Hankou foreign firms, it felt like it had reached its peak. Before long, due to a slight relaxation of export routes, it fell from outside 40 yuan to 356 yuan, and recently it fell to 33.7 yuan. In just ten days, it has loosened slightly by ten yuan. The severity of the decline is unprecedented in recent years. Today's sharp decline was also caused by the previous rise. Today's decline may create a future rise. Those engaged in this industry must pay attention. According to the report from Hankou, the market has slightly turned around, and the price of foreign firms has increased by six dimes and has been sold to 34.3 yuan. If so, the signs of a rise have already emerged.</p>

<h3>Death in Russian Literature</h3>
<p>— Li Bo</p>
<p>"Russian aristocratic literature does not depict 'robbers,' but excels in depicting 'Dead Souls,' 'Living Corpses,' 'House of the Dead,' 'The Power of Darkness,' 'Three Deaths,' and many other deaths." Gorky said this in an essay.</p>
<p>Not just aristocratic literature, but death became the most striking theme in the entire old Russian literature. Many great geniuses vividly depicted various kinds of death. We know of Dostoevsky's embarrassing deaths, Turgenev's and Chekhov's melancholy deaths, Andreev's "terror and madness" deaths. Even Gorky himself, who brought "golden dreams" in an era of suffering, described many terrible deaths. Seeing Sergey's sudden death in "My Childhood," everyone feels a bit uneasy, right? And "The Orloff Couple" is filled with the tragic deaths of cholera patients.</p>
<p>The reality under the Tsar, due to the paralysis of the capitalist system, the famine of the land, the cruel exploitation by landlords, and the iron heels of the Cossack gendarmes, the death of the people became the most ordinary thing. The prevalence of death in literature is not surprising.</p>
<p>However, because of different backgrounds, death also has various forms.</p>
<p>The "poor man" Devushkin, dying, still asks to "see the daylight, see the splendor of God, see the sunshine." This is the death of a petty-bourgeois intellectual. Many such melancholy deaths can be found in Turgenev's books.</p>
<p>However, Turgenev, who elegantly depicted the deaths of intellectuals, also depicted another kind of different death. In "A Sportsman's Sketches," he describes the peasant Maxim being hit by a tree and dying, remembering the horse he just paid a deposit for yesterday, asking people to leave it for his wife. Here, the author sighs and says, "Poor Maxim's death couldn't help but make me quietly think, how strangely Russian peasants die. His situation before death cannot be called indifferent or dull. He dies as if performing a ritual, both calm and casual."</p>
<p>I remember in one of Chekhov's short stories, a coachman, because the wheels were stuck in the deep snow and he couldn't push it, and he was unwilling to abandon the cart in the snowy wilderness, so he sat on the cart and froze to death alive. This kind of death, lighter than a feather, is also frequently seen in the books of other great writers. Gogol, who depicted "Dead Souls" and "The Overcoat," also depicted another kind of heroic and magnificent death. It is precisely because the Slavic people have this kind of death that they avoid all other unnecessary tragic deaths. This is the death of Taras Bulba.</p>
<p>Taras Bulba, this white-haired heroic warrior, whose army he led was defeated, and he himself became a prisoner of cruel enemies. The enemy bound him with iron chains, his hands were nailed high on the branches, and dry firewood was piled under him. They were going to burn him alive. However, this respectable old man did not pay any attention to the terrible fate that was about to befall him personally. He was still shouting out the escape route of his troops on the tree: "People, go to the riverbank, go to the riverbank! Take the road on the left and go under the rock wall, there are boats by the river. Get on the boat, they won't catch you." In this way, he happily watched his troops escape, turned his head and proudly scolded the enemy, "However, the fire has already risen from the dry firewood: the fire wrapped his feet, and the flames stretched to the tree..."</p>
<p>Such a magnificent martyr's death, we can also see in new works like "The Rout," but that has a higher significance.</p>
<h3>Lottery</h3>
<p>— Ding</p>
<p>That kind of lottery ticket with extremely tempting power finally touched the heart of this old woman who had been thrifty all her life.</p>
<p>She has always been pure-hearted and peaceful, living quietly and leisurely. She has never had any evil thoughts of greed for unexpected money; especially regarding risky gambling, she has not only never been involved, but she often advises her relatives and younger generations against this kind of bad behavior. Even if there are festivals like three days or two days in the family, in other people's homes, although they are not immersed in the whirlpool of gambling, they sometimes can't help but join in the fun. However, she, this family, under the strict constraints of the old woman, will never be careless.</p>
<p>But in the evening, the past family style has completely changed. At this moment, the old woman herself cannot control herself, and a violent impulse is constantly moving in her heart. She seems to be unconsciously doubtful about her own words and deeds.</p>
<p>"How could it become like this?" Sometimes she would ask herself in surprise.</p>
<p>However, when she thinks of the piles of gold, her eyes will be dazzled, and her heart will be agitated. This makes her sometimes fall into a state of anxiety and irritability. In short, she is not as pure and desireless as she used to be.</p>
<p>"500,000 top prize!... " She would say endlessly to others, "500,000! Do you know? The richest Lin family in our village has only 300,000, 300,000 at most. He claims to be the emperor and does whatever he wants in our village. Tell you, if God blesses my old woman with 500,000, isn't that more decent than him, the Lin family? Actually, even 50,000 is enough. We can't spend it all in our lifetime. Where can we earn so much money besides such a windfall? We can't accumulate it in three or eight generations. So, tell you, I only spend one dollar on it (although one dollar is not a small amount), but you think, we have the luck of winning a 50,000 prize, what could be more cost-effective than this in the world? No, this is what is meant by a small investment with huge profits."</p>
<p>After saying so much, she lifted her heavily wrinkled face, narrowed her eyes, and stared at her two relatives for a long time.</p>
<p>"What you said is really pleasant to hear. You are much more open-minded than before. As long as we have money, who wouldn't kowtow to us! When the time comes, we can also build houses, buy land, lend money, collect rent, and leave a lot of money for our children and grandchildren."</p>
<p>Aunt Zhang also said excitedly to her.</p>
<p>But Aunt Li, who was sitting next to her, felt very uncomfortable, so she said to them angrily, "What you said is true, and that's what you think in your heart, but... we better not think about that kind of thing. We can't think about it, old woman Huang, Aunt Zhang, you say am I right? Poor people won't have luck, you also know..." She looked at old woman Huang, "What I told you: the He family, the Yang family, the Liu family, the Jiang family... they all failed in gambling. Even right now – excuse me for saying something offensive, Aunt Zhang, haven't you also failed in gambling?" She turned to look at Aunt Zhang again, "Otherwise, how would you suffer this kind of hardship today: no warm clothes, no food, begging from east to west, being looked down upon, it's all your own fault..."</p>
<p>Old woman Huang and Aunt Zhang were a little embarrassed by what she said, but after thinking carefully, this was also Aunt Li's good intentions, so Aunt Zhang spoke first:</p>
<p>"The poorer people are, the more they want money, Aunt Li, how can poor people like us live without trying to find some money! Not to mention the far future, old woman Huang, wasn't she always frugal before, why is she still living a hard life like you now! So... let's try our luck! Aunt Li."</p>
<p>"That's right, let's rely on trying our luck!" Old woman Huang also became happy.</p>
<p>"You won't get lucky even if you try your whole life! Hey, you are giving away the money you saved with hard work to other people for nothing, it's really..."</p>
<p>Hearing these words, they all felt bored, and Aunt Li stopped talking. So everyone dispersed.</p>
<p>After everyone left, old woman Huang hurriedly sent someone to buy a lottery ticket. She firmly put it in her pocket. From this moment on, she waited day and night for the arrival of the lottery draw date, the 50,000 yuan top prize. She continued to think about it day and night, praying, concentrating her spirit, which was unbearable for hardship at the age of sixty or seventy, completely on the lottery ticket. Looking at this lottery ticket made her associate with all the aspirations of future wealth. Looking at this lottery ticket, she numbly lost her previous tranquility and constant heart and leisurely residence and fell into such a chaotic and disturbing state at the moment.</p>
<p>After enduring many days of suffering, the lottery draw day finally arrived. When she heard a disappointing report, everything in front of her suddenly turned black!</p>
<h3>Night of a Great Thunderstorm</h3>
<p>— Shao Guanhua</p>
<p>The great thunderstorm crashed against the coast,</p>
<p>The coast lowered.</p>
<p>The tall willows along the coast,</p>
<p>Also seem to have been pulled up.</p>
<p>Lightning flashed on the plain,</p>
<p>Grass and flowers hugged as if crying.</p>
<p>Perhaps the smile of the starlight,</p>
<p>Will also be reduced because of this.</p>
<p>It's even more chaotic in front of the thatched cottage,</p>
<p>The steps are full of drips.</p>
<p>The wind and rain are alternatingly fanning,</p>
<p>Dripping and breaking the hearts of the poor.</p>
<h3>Mr. Juqing (13)</h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>Like an old horse lost in the wilderness, with no way to go in any direction, he was deeply distressed.</p>
<p>One afternoon, he was busy correcting students' calligraphy exercises when suddenly the school's handyman, Lao Quan, brought him a letter. Mr. Juqing's heart pounded wildly, and he opened the letter with trembling hands. Inside was only a mimeographed form: ×× County, Ninth District, ×× Town Tutor Survey Form. It was sent by the Bureau of Education to the district primary school for distribution. The investigation of private schools was confirmed. Staring blankly at the detailed items on the form: name, native place, age, background... What to do? It's not good to fill it out, and it's even worse not to fill it out. Should he find some tutors to discuss it with, but wouldn't that make people laugh? He didn't want to.</p>
<p>He delayed for two days, the more he hesitated, the more confused he became, and the more indecisive he was. At the same time, the atmosphere outside became more tense.</p>
<p>"A notice has already been posted at the school, and they are about to arrest private schools." Shen Qingzhong met a classmate at the school that morning and told him this. This was passed on to Mr. Juqing's study.</p>
<p>Hearing these words, a thousand-pound millstone was immediately placed on Mr. Juqing's heart, making him even more anxious. He inquired everywhere, but couldn't find out any clues.</p>
<p>He flipped through the almanac and found that the next day was a Sunday, when the school was on vacation and there would be no one there. He sent two older students, repeatedly instructing them dozens of times! He told them to go to the school to see what notices were posted and copy them down.</p>
<p>Waiting for half an hour was as long and unbearable as the rest of his life. With great difficulty, they came back empty-handed.</p>
<p>"Is there a notice?" he quickly asked.</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>"Why didn't you copy it down?"</p>
<p>"Because, because, there are many notices, and we don't understand them!"</p>
<p>There was silence for a long time. A risky idea was fiercely fighting in Mr. Juqing's mind. Finally—</p>
<p>"Is there anyone at the school?" he asked again.</p>
<p>The student shook his head: "Not a single person."</p>
<p>There was no way to think about it. Mr. Juqing was uneasy for a while, mustered up his courage, instructed the students to study hard, and decided to take the risk of exploring himself.</p>
<p>The school building was converted from the Water Moon Nunnery (even the school property was confiscated from the nunnery). The guardian Wei Tuo by the second gate has not been removed. He stands in the shrine, raising one foot in imposing manner. However, the golden whip in his hand has been broken in half. Mr. Juqing had come to peep a few times during the winter vacation. He knew where the "notice board" for posting notices was. He was originally familiar with this place.</p>
<h3>First Meeting</h3>
<p>— Li Huiying</p>
<p>]</p>
<p>— One of the Miscellaneous Writings on Lake Touring —</p>
<p>Arriving in Hangzhou in the drizzle, and then strolling along the West Lake in the drizzle. The time is half past five in the afternoon.</p>
<p>The lake in the rain would originally disappoint tourists at a glance, but when it is evening, letting the rain and mist envelop the lake surface, this blurred outline, mixed with green willows and red flowers, has a unique charm. The boats come and go in the water, looking like some big black fish from a distance. West Lake, which I have heard of for years but have not had the opportunity to appreciate, I can now finally meet. It's the first meeting.</p>
<p>Mr. Wu and I walked onto an earthen embankment in the lake. It is said to be an earthen embankment, but the surface has already been paved with a layer of asphalt.</p>
<p>"This should be Su Causeway, right?"</p>
<p>I said softly as I walked, looking at the lake and the mountain peaks buried in the rain clouds in the distance. We were all visiting the lake for the first time, and we were completely unfamiliar with the lake and mountains here. We just thought of it because we had heard that there was a causeway called Su Causeway in West Lake.</p>
<p>"Maybe."</p>
<p>Mr. Wu responded slowly, turning around to dodge the public bus driving onto the embankment.</p>
<p>"This bridge," we walked to a bridge, "must be Broken Bridge. Isn't there a scene of 'Remnant Snow on Broken Bridge'?"</p>
<p>After I finished speaking, I had already walked down the bridge. Mr. Wu nodded. He agreed with my statement.</p>
<p>(But after Mr. Huang explained the next day, I realized that what we thought was Su Causeway was originally Bai Causeway, but we guessed correctly about Broken Bridge.)</p>
<p>The sky gradually darkened, and the electric lights around shone with light, faintly obscured by the rain.</p>
<p>We can still see the gray towers standing on the nearby mountains in the blurred rain and mist night, and near the towers are rugged hard rocks and soft green willows. Below are rows of Western-style houses.</p>
<p>"What tower is this," I said, "Leifeng Pagoda, no," I suddenly remembered that Leifeng Pagoda was said to have collapsed, "Then it's Baoshu Pagoda."</p>
<p>"It must be. Leifeng Pagoda has indeed collapsed."</p>
<p>We walked slowly, and after passing another bridge, we saw four ink characters "Ping Hu Qiu Yue" written on a white-gray wall. "Ping Hu Qiu Yue," it seems I heard others say that it is also one of the "Ten Scenes" of West Lake, but all that is placed in front of us are only four characters. Besides, we can't see a unique place in the scenery. I couldn't help but say:</p>
<p>"It seems that the naming of some local scenery is named by its name. 'Ping Hu Qiu Yue' should belong to this kind."</p>
<p>(After visiting several places the next day, I confirmed that my words were not wrong. Places like "Jiuli Songyuan" and "Qu Yuan He Feng" are the same, leaving only beautiful names and no scenery.)</p>
<p>We passed the back door of Zhongshan Park, where there are stone steps that can be walked up. Mr. Wu wanted to go in and have a look, but it was completely dark and the rain hadn't stopped, so I suggested. .</p>
<p>"Let's go back, let's visit again tomorrow." Immediately afterwards, I said:</p>
<p>"I pray that it will be sunny tomorrow." He smiled.</p>
<p>"Okay, let's go back."</p>
<h3>Last Year's Graduates</h3>
<h3>Ballad of the Boxer Rebellion (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>Among the ballads about the Boxer Rebellion in 1900, Wu Yanren's is the most famous. In addition, Tan Xisheng also wrote a part, called "Romance of the Righteous Harmony Society". This is also a book that was first published in newspapers and then printed as a single volume in the third year of Xuantong. It consists of two volumes, twenty chapters, lithographed, with illustrations. There is a preface to the book, explaining the purpose of writing this book, to ask everyone to "not forget danger in peace, and to learn from the pain," because at that time, although they had suffered such a huge tragedy, "by the time the peace agreement was completed, public sentiment was very different. The habits of extravagance and lasciviousness resurfaced in people's hearts, and the habit of perfunctory and irresponsible actions still prevailed in the world." The author was moved to write this. The narration of the whole book begins with the conflict between the Qingping County martial arts examinee and the converts, the officials leaning towards the converts, leading to the martial arts examinee taking revenge and leading five hundred disciples to kill the whole family of the two converts; it ends with the "holy drive covered in dust", stationed in Huailai County, ordering Li Hongzhang to be the plenipotentiary representative to negotiate peace with the envoys of various countries. This book is not a work of any remarkable value, but it is still a gratifying thing to break out of the scope of talented scholars and beautiful women singing ballads and apply it to political and social aspects. The position taken by the author is against the Boxer Rebellion, against some ministers and officials who supported the Boxer Rebellion, and against the slaughter of imperialism. What he hates most is that officials treat good people as bandits, and even loot the entire village. Therefore, at the beginning of the book, he sings about a minister who went to suppress bandits and looted a good village, until after the event, he realized that there were no bandits there:</p>
<p>Wrongfully killing hundreds of thousands of people, it took less than half an hour. Looking at the village, there was no shadow of anyone, the fog cleared and the sky was clear. The commander ordered the soldiers to camp, and entered the village with his servants. Corpses were all over the street, no one was there, several houses were burned. Walking along, he didn't realize how far he had gone, but when he looked up, he was suddenly shocked. Walking to a place, he saw a small temple in front of him, with the three characters "Guan Di Temple" written on it. In front of the temple was a stage, piled with costumes and weapons, which were also knocked down by artillery shells at this time, scattered and broken. Looking again, the corpses on the ground, some with painted faces, some with beards, some with legs blown off, some with pierced bellies, lying on the ground one by one. Shi Dun looked at it for a while, and suddenly understood, and exclaimed, "It's not good, they were performing plays here to reward the gods, not stirring up trouble, wrongly suppressing good people, what should I do?" So, dispirited, he hurried back to the camp to search for ideas himself. (Volume 2)</p>

<p>Talks</p>
<h3>Talking about "Leisurely World-Weariness"</h3>
<p>— Stee</p>
<p>The spring is bright, the grass is green, this is a great "play" weather. The Chinese are not very good at other things, but they are not behind others when it comes to the so-called "play." We don't have to deliberately search for examples, just think back to our ancestors, the so-called elegant scholars, the so-called noble people, they would not easily miss the "play" things. And they played with very famous names. In the four seasons and eight festivals, each period has its own characteristics: "Spring tour of the fragrant grass, summer appreciation of the green lotus river, autumn drink of chrysanthemum wine, winter chanting of white snow poems." Three hundred and sixty days a year, in the eyes of our Chinese so-called noble people and elegant scholars who are good at playing, they can be said to be planning how to play all the time.</p>
<p>So, the peerless poet Li Bai held a big banquet in Taoyuan on a spring night, recounting the joys of family life. The melancholy and romantic Wang Xizhi repaired and purified himself at the Orchid Pavilion in a timely manner. These are all elegant events of "play" for our elegant ancestors in the spring, and they are still deeply imprinted in the minds of those who consider themselves romantic figures. As for "the autumn is high and the air is crisp, Meng Jia's hat fell off Longshan," and Tao Yuanming, who was unwilling to bend his waist for five dou of rice, sang "Return," and lived a leisurely life at home, "picking chrysanthemums under the eastern fence, and leisurely seeing the southern mountains," doesn't this prove how "leisurely" and good at "play" our ancestors were?</p>
<p>Really, these ancestors should have had their fun. At that time, "the world was peaceful." And every noble person and elegant scholar held a fairly good position in the court. They didn't have to worry about anything for the country, nor did they have to worry about their personal lives. Their stomachs were full of knowledge, and their stomachs were full of "too much leisure" complaints. They had nothing to do when they wanted to do things. Studying knowledge, after all, knowledge has its limits, and they were already learned people. Studying science, they didn't even know there was such a thing at that time. There was nothing to say, if they didn't live a "world-weary" life, what else could they do? Therefore, their "leisurely world-weariness" was also their opportunity.</p>
<p>Now, it's the so-called spring again. It's time for Li Bai, Wang Xizhi, and the others to play again. I wonder what our Chinese people who are good at playing are doing? That's right, times have changed. The spring outings of the ancients were nothing more than repairing mountains and forests, drinking wine while looking at flowers. Now, Chinese people's entertainment is as new as Western civilization. In addition to playing in the mountains, playing in the water, hiking, and admiring flowers, there is also dancing, movies, and all kinds of newer pastimes. We don't have to worry that the "world-weary" behavior of "leisure" people will have a bleak day.</p>
<h3>The Last of a Man</h3>
<p>— Ling Zixi</p>
<p>At dusk, just as families were about to light their fires and cook dinner, a wailing cry erupted from Changfu's house. The women at the village entrance exchanged knowing glances: Old Man Changfu had finally "fallen down" so easily.</p>
<p>Sister Guibao, who was washing rice in the riverbed, pursed her lips and then made a strange face. "Hmph, he finally had his day."</p>
<p>"Of course! He was only human, after all. No matter how tough, you can't outlast the King of Hell. But it's Changfu's wife who suffered."</p>
<p>"It's Changfu's wife who suffered, ah."</p>
<p>Changfu's wife had been ground to death, a living death at the young age of twenty-three. And now: Old Man Changfu, representing this ancient generation, had also passed away amidst sparse sobs.</p>
<p>Who in the village could forget the vivid impression of Changfu's wife?</p>
<p>Such a plump, sturdy girl: her skin a bit dark, with "natural feet," and jet-black eyes. She was certainly capable of doing "servant's work." Every day, she carried three or five loads of water, picked twenty-odd catties of cotton, without even a groan. She wasn't one to talk much, only knowing to diligently "work," never being lazy, and she was amiable to people. For example, when the villagers were washing rice and vegetables by the river, if she saw an old woman or a pregnant "sister-in-law," without them even frowning or complaining of back pain, she would come over and help them with this and that. Her tongue wasn't "sharp," and she never engaged in arguments. A fellow like that naturally had good "popular appeal." Wasn't that so? No one in the village spoke badly of Changfu's wife; if anyone did, it would only be Old Man Changfu.</p>
<p>Changfu's wife was only seventeen when she married into the family. At that time, Old Man Changfu had already contracted rheumatism. Every day, he just sat in the sun after eating his fill, making things difficult for people. Old Man Changfu's "difficult nature" was famous throughout the village. When Changfu's wife married into the family, someone had said, "It's a pity that a lamb has fallen into a pack of wolves."</p>
<p>Changfu was a useless "lantern shell," only knowing to take three coppers to the teahouse to chew the cud, returning to eat lunch, yawn, and then lie on the bamboo mat like a pig, sleeping. He didn't care about anything, even during the busy farming season. Sometimes, Changfu's wife was so busy that she couldn't even catch her breath. When she asked him to help, Old Man Changfu would start cursing:</p>
<p>"Country folk can't afford to support a young mistress! Such a plump figure, and you can't even handle this little bit of life, and you still want to call on a man? You've completely trampled on the man's ambition!"</p>
<p>Changfu's wife would become very sad. But she was strong, so she swallowed the tears that fell into her stomach and hurried back to the fields. A sentence swirled in her stomach: "Ten years a daughter-in-law, ten years a mother-in-law, and in another ten years, I'll be a great-grandmother. If I had a child, life would be better, right?"</p>
<p>But whenever she thought of children, her heart felt like it was being pierced by a sharp needle. She remembered what Mapizi from the oil mill had told her one day: "Changfu is a useless, good-for-nothing fellow..." Thinking of this, her heart felt like it had been drenched in cold water, growing colder and colder.</p>
<p>But in the three years that followed, Old Man Changfu would curse her every time he saw her: "White Tiger Star, White Tiger Star! You've been here for two or three years, and you've ruined the man's body, and you haven't even produced a fart! White Tiger Star, ah..."</p>
<p>Beating, cursing, tying her up with ropes—he tormented her like that for three years. Then, in the spring of the fourth year, she took a breath of resentment and, alive, bearing the shadow of the old era, jumped into the well.</p>
<p>And now, Old Man Changfu, who represented this stubborn and wicked generation, had also died. The young people in the village all seemed to breathe a sigh of relief. It was the end of one man, but also the end of an entire generation.</p>
<h3>The Yearner</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>Living in a vast metropolis teeming with people, in a house as small as the pigeonholes that people often describe, under a perpetually gray sky, with the beast-like wails of sirens and the sounds of cars, one gradually develops a yearning for broad lands or the sea. Sometimes, like a prisoner freed from his cell, I would walk to the nearby coast or the quiet villages behind the city, where there were blue skies and blue waters, the shadows of sails set off by green reeds, and small wildflowers swaying contentedly in the bright sun. There, I could use my whole ear to listen, my whole eye to see, and my whole soul to feel everything before me, and a feeling of grateful joy would well up in my heart. But after that fleeting moment of happiness passed, I would put on the shackles of the mundane once more: the faces of ordinary people, pointless conversations, the efforts of firewood, rice, oil, and salt, a room so narrow that it felt like it was crushing me flat, a windowless space that inflicted cruel torture on one's spirit. Thus, days are spent mixing along in laughter and talk. But those born at the bottom of a well sometimes want to see the sky, and that almost irresistible, feverish yearning for nature would unexpectedly envelop my entire being.</p>
<p>Recently, I often feel an unappeasable yearning in my heart. I want to run in the vast, boundless desert, to sing and shout on the seashore, to stand on the summit of a high mountain and watch the endless sea of clouds and the solemn sunrise that illuminates the four directions, to lie in a silent, deserted wilderness, feel the night wind blowing, and watch the shadows of thousands of stars. Once, I had a dream in which the sun gilded the sparkling waves with golden light, and the white foam of the waves ceaselessly encroached upon the beach. I was barefoot, dancing on the beach, facing the sun. That instant of bright, sublime joy practically permeated my heart and spread through my limbs. The vaguely visible islands, fishing boats one after another, and the subtle purity of the shells, glistening in the sunlight like a noblewoman's jewels, were like the lone sound of a xiao in the morning breeze. But after giving this poor person a moment of satisfaction, they became material for countless memories and laments. Leaning on my pillow, thinking of what I had experienced in my dream, as soon as I opened my eyes, the crushing, unbearable impression of the yellow roof would come crashing down.</p>
<p>I say: this is simply a form of torture.</p>
<p>Watching day turn into night, and then night turn into day,</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Thus, I quietly yearn, and in my heart beneath my shirt, a heart that contains both hope and disappointment, variegated patterns are woven: verdant groves, strange and precipitous ten-thousand-foot peaks, the sea, the sea, the sun, the desolate wilderness swept by a gentle breeze, wildflowers, the beauty of a small stream, the sadness of an evening dusk, the golden star high in the quiet night, gulls and sails, and a long string of brilliant days of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, changing endlessly. This yearning shelters me, like a loving mother sheltering an infant in swaddling clothes. Just taking this wish out and warming it once seems to isolate me from this noisy city.</p>
<h3>Poet's Diary</h3>
<p>— Yi Lang</p>
<p>One evening, I was strolling alone in the park, and I came to the artificial hill where the spring water was gurgling, playing the music of "Rainbow Skirt Feather Dress." Just as I was about to find a place to rest, I found this small notebook under the rock. It seemed to be a poet's diary.</p>
<p>March 13th Spring has come, and I think of the frogs in the small pond and the orioles in the willow waves. Aren't they already singing the song of spring? I should write a poem or two to welcome the spring. But after thinking for a long time, I only got two lines. Isn't there a "short poem" style? You can also call it "haiku." Let's just call it haiku. Recording: "How red the faces of the flowers are, ripples have also risen on the lake!"</p>
<p>March 14th In order to write poetry, I should go to the countryside to welcome the spring. I discussed it with my wife, and we decided to go to Longhua today to see the peach blossoms. The peach blossoms have bloomed early this year. But that worldly woman quarreled with me about it. She said that she didn't care about being unemployed, but I remembered seeing the peach blossoms so well... She chased away my desire to travel completely and banished my poetic inspiration to the ninth heaven. Women are really hopeless... unreasonable. Unemployment, unemployment, she always brings up unemployment. Didn't I already tell you? "Don't mention the word unemployment again in the future?" But she brought it up again today? Unemployment is already unemployment, what's the use of bringing it up? If I don't write poetry, where can I entrust my spirit?... The greatest thing in the world is being a poet. Only poets can immerse themselves in sweet dreams every day.</p>
<p>March 15th Last night, because Baby Byron was crying, my wife complained to me and said all sorts of nasty, vulgar things. Really. I didn't want to be unemployed, you know. You complain, but I have more complaints than you do. I taught well, taught for seven or eight years, who would have thought that today I can't even eat chalk dust and sit on a cold bench? You scold me for not being capable, who is better than me, if I don't teach, I can become a poet? Isn't being a poet being capable? My friends all praise my poems as well done... Baby Byron is crying again, my wife is scolding even more fiercely, I don't care about her. Ah, poetic inspiration has come, - "The swallows on the painted beams understand human feelings, accompanying loneliness, they circle the moon and weep..."</p>
<p>March 16th I went out this morning to borrow money again, and I struck out again. Everyone said that the market was not good and there was no way, and Lao Zhang was still sighing and lamenting. What's the use of sighing and lamenting in this era?... But as soon as I got home, as soon as I pushed open the door to the room in the garret, my wife's ugly face forced me to frown just like her. I just raised my hands empty, she snorted, but tears started to flow. I comforted her for a while and said some boastful and ambitious words to shut her mouth. Then the landlady who wanted the rent appeared at the door... I can't even write poetry today. The most hateful thing in the world is the landlady.</p>
<p>March 17th My wife is sick. I have to hold Baby Byron myself, and I have to buy the vegetables myself, and I have to cook the rice myself - who would have thought that being a poet would come to this? While cooking, I heard the radio broadcast from the neighbors' house, and my mood was so depressed that I had poetic inspiration, but I couldn't write it. When I was holding the child, poetic inspiration came again, and I quickly took out my diary and wrote it down, getting one line: "Spring is at the top of the building, people are in the building..." The child started to cry, and my poetic thoughts were cut off again, really! Only now do I realize that it is not easy to be a poet in such an environment. Forget it, I will not be a poet from now on.</p>
<p>March 19th Why is my wife's illness getting worse and worse? I should call a doctor, right? But calling a doctor and taking medicine all costs money, where is the money? There are only four jiaos left - ... It's probably not a big deal, let's see how it goes tomorrow and then decide.</p>
<p>March 20th This is terrible, the doctor said that my wife should go to the hospital, even sending her to a third-class room in the Red Cross Society costs money! (Morning note) I borrowed a few yuan from Lao Han, and he came to help, and then I sent my wife to the hospital. It was already night at this time, I thought that taking medicine might make her feel better? I will go to see her early in the morning tomorrow. But it is really annoying to bring this child back and forth. Should I leave him with the landlady downstairs? I don't know if she is willing to take care of him for me, I will try it tomorrow.</p>
<p>The diary ends here, leaving many blank pages. I don't know if that poet's wife has recovered from her illness, and what has happened to the child. In my imagination, I thought of many terrible things happening to him, and I couldn't help but shiver. At this time, the wind blew, and the treetops were rustling. Why is this spring so cold? Summer has not yet come, and there is a bit of autumn air.</p>

<p>Opening Chapter "Spring Outing"</p>
<p>The spring scenery of Jiangnan is full of Yingzhou. Fragrant grass at the end of the world recalls... I remember the many charming traces of stepping on the green grass on the embroidered path. When spring comes, the mood is leisurely. Visiting famous sites. Talking about romance. Willows hide Su Xiao's tower in their shade. Spring clouds are light green and the waves are thick. A small boat in the morning breeze and the remaining moon. The whip is fine. The hat shadow is secluded. Fragrant carriages and precious horses are greener than oil. People come and go like weaving. Everyone says that the joy of spring is strong. Casually passing the Qingming Festival again. And leave a paw on the spring river. Apricot blossoms sway along the way. A few mountain traces quickly welcome the eyes. Whose yard is a delightful event? The clear sound of the oriole chirps softly hundreds of times. Asking where to find the fairy source of peach blossoms. Are the people of Wuling still there? Walking along the flower-filled road. Crossing the rainbow bridge and crossing the Bixi River again. A belt of continuous green ribbons. Small birds chirp on the branches. Standing alone in the setting sun like a crane. Sighing that the fleeting time is like a floating... Life at sunset is like morning dew. And seek joy and don't add sorrow. More leisurely and pleasant. Suddenly I heard the flower seller shout out her small pearly throat. Returning swallows have lowered the curtain hook.</p>

<p>Topic: Qi, Zheng, and Wei Fight at the Festival</p>
<p>In all things under heaven, what is right, what is proper, what is good, should all be done. What is wrong, what is wicked, what is evil, should all be avoided. Although there are ten thousand different things, can they go beyond these two extremes? The world is commonly plagued by arrogance and self-importance, but few have thought deeply about it. Why not reflect on our own actions? Are they not things that should be done? Then we would be too busy feeling ashamed and fearful to dare to boast to others. Are they things that should be done? Then they are like eating when hungry and drinking when thirsty, nothing to boast about. Even the filial piety of Shun, the merits of Yu, the plans of Yi Yin and Gao Tao, the loyalty of Ji and Xie, the purity of Bo Yi and Shu Qi, and the learning of Confucius and Mencius, those who stand above all others in the world, are in fact things that ordinary people should do. People in the world only have one good quality, and they think they are superior to others. This is also ridiculous. Human beings cannot be fully understood except by sages. Now, having received human form, they claim to be superior to others. Are they going to fly with wings or gallop with silk? How deluded they are! Zheng Hu rescued Qi, which can be said to be meritorious. However, rescuing the distressed and helping neighbors are also things that princes should do. He immediately boasted of his merits, lightly dismissing the titles and rewards of the Zhou Dynasty and wanting to annex them. Then he added ten more gongs to Lu. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>To Become a Movie Star from a Singer Requires Beauty, Brains, and Good Character</h3>
<p>— Rencin</p>
<p>First, let us introduce who this Billie Burke is. She is the widow of the late Florenz Ziegfeld, a giant in the New York entertainment industry. She was once a famous singer and stage actress, a talented and beautiful woman. Since her husband's death, she has not only been a wealthy widow but has also inherited her husband's business, holding a high and respected position in the New York entertainment and film industries. Here is what she indicated are the necessities for a woman to become a star.</p>
<p>She said, "If someone asks me what are the three most important conditions for a young singer to become a star on the screen, I will unhesitatingly tell her one 'B' word, which is the three words: Beauty, Brains, and Balance (美貌, 腦筋, 和均衡)."</p>
<p>Because so many women have achieved fame by transitioning from the entertainment industry to the film industry, the entertainment industry has become the greatest "breeding ground" for American female talent. However, a woman who wants to attract public attention through singing and dancing cannot rely solely on beauty; she must also possess brains. What is balance? She must also have the perseverance to study diligently. This requires a balance and lasting strength in both physical and mental health to be able to stand firm and endure the pain of long working hours. Balance is not limited to physical and mental health; it also requires the same cultivation in morality and character to have the same perseverance.</p>
<p>Billie Burke also said, "There was a time when singers were seen as ignorant women. They were playthings for the wealthy. Or they themselves used their beauty and sacrificed their virtue to win the money of the wealthy. But that era, apart from one or two who did not cherish themselves, is now a thing of the past."</p>
<p>"Today's singers are different from those of the past. They all know how to educate themselves, just like ordinary people in other careers. Now, ambitious singers, like other ambitious professional women, have no time to waste on nightlife and frivolous habits. If they have free time, they will also know that their health and beauty cannot last in late nights and dissolute living."</p>
<p>"I remember that just a few years ago, my husband conducted a test of the educational background of singers. Surprisingly, he found that 83 percent of the singers had attended high school or university. Many of them graduated with honors. Therefore, the common saying that 'beautiful women have no knowledge' is certainly no longer applicable to these singers."</p>
<p>Since Ziegfeld's death, Hollywood believes that many of the female movie stars in the film industry were promoted by him during his lifetime. His contributions are not limited to the entertainment industry, and he has equal merit in the film industry. Therefore, they are now filming a movie to capture Ziegfeld's life on the screen to last forever. Ziegfeld's widow, Billie Burke, has also been hired to select and choreograph the work of the singers.</p>
<p>Billie Burke said, "When Ziegfeld was alive, he very self-consciously chose only good women. He insisted that a singer's behavior be equally unquestionable both on and off the stage. In fact, the reason why Ziegfeld was valued by society and worshiped by the singers themselves was because of his serious attitude, which emphasized the character of a singer. If it was necessary to discipline a certain singer for something, she would definitely be willing because she knew that Ziegfeld was fair and impartial, and his doing so was for the sake of everyone's reputation and future."</p>
<p>"But now, choosing singers for singing and dancing on the screen is even more difficult than choosing them for the stage. They must be more beautiful and charming than the stars because only the most beautiful and radiant faces can attract the attention of the audience in the shimmering of the screen. Furthermore, there are no shortcuts to fame in singing and dancing sequences and their eventual stardom. Anyone who thinks that the life of a singer should be more leisurely than the life of an actress is wrong. The life of a singer, like the life of an actress, is extremely difficult and easily disappointing. And they must remember that whether they start as singers or go straight to being actresses, they cannot succeed by beauty alone. They must remember the three 'B's: Beauty, Brains, and Balance."</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3>Review of "Ruggles of Red Gap"</h3>
<p>Ruggles of Red Gap</p>
<p>— Guotai</p>
<p>First, I must tell the readers that here is a very interesting story. No, rather than saying it is interesting, it would be more accurate to say that the playwright used a comedic form to convey the spirit of human equality. I think those who have seen this film will definitely not ignore the playwright's expression of the process of the decline of feudal forces and the rise of emerging capitalism, which affected people's ideological changes. Obviously, the nobles in decline treated servants as gambling objects and easily lost them to others in a gambling game. However, this servant, in the hands of the emerging capitalist Americans, was not good at using the authority over servants. They were not accustomed to the habits of noble gentlemen, and they treated servants as friends.</p>
<p>Of course, you can imagine that the protagonist Ruggles, who has a servile nature, grew up in the feudal aristocratic class. He is accustomed to the rules and etiquette of gentlemen and ladies. Even when his master allows him to be presumptuous, he does not dare to be presumptuous, unless he reveals his true nature when he is drunk. However, after a long period of influence, in America, where Lincoln advocated the emancipation of slaves and demanded human equality, this servant from the Parisian aristocracy gradually felt that he should have the status of a human being. So he read Lincoln's speeches thoroughly, and in the emerging democratic America, he was liberated and became a formal citizen. On the day of the final hotel opening, in the cheers of the people, he was recognized as a "happy man."</p>
<p>Such a view is reflected in the film. At present, it naturally has its exaggerated praise for the so-called free state of America. However, in the decline of feudal forces and the rise of emerging capitalism, as a film that reflects the reality of the time, it is not without progressive significance. Therefore, the fact that "Ruggles of Red Gap" can have such content has already determined its value.</p>
<p>Secondly, in terms of performance techniques, I think this kind of comedy is really worthy of being called humorous. Generally speaking, it is difficult to find humorous comedies in American films. Most of them are pretentious farces and inhumane nonsense, making the audience laugh unconsciously, completely determining the value of the comedy on empty excitement. But this "Ruggles of Red Gap" is completely an exception. We cannot find any unconscious nonsense here, nor can we see any pretentious farce. All we see is profound humor expressed in the dialogue, as if reading Bernard Shaw's articles, which is so thought-provoking. Unfortunately, Chinese audiences cannot fully understand the dialogue, which is inevitably a loss for the opening of "Ruggles of Red Gap" in China. (Of course, there will be the same loss in other foreign countries.)</p>
<p>In this regard, using dialogue to convey the plot is not an appropriate way. It is not desirable that this film cannot increase the comedic effect more in action. However, the director's clear grasp of the characters' personalities, especially the change in the protagonist's personality, and the excellent acting skills of Charles Laughton, really give people a very good impression. Yes, the director's technique is commendable. He does not seek people's favor with frivolous jokes, but he gives us a lasting aftertaste. This is not only reflected in the protagonist Charles Laughton, but also in the performances of Mary Boland, Charlie Ruggles, and others, which also show the achievement of directing acting skills. Correctly speaking, we cannot say that it is a great success for him, but we cannot find any shortcomings in film techniques.</p>
<p>Tianyi's new sound film "Return" directed by Gao Lihong, starring Fan Xuepeng, Jing Lixia, Chen Yan, etc., will be shown at the Jincheng Grand Theater.</p>

<h3>After Office Hours (8)</h3>
<p>— Tongyun</p>
<p>Snow stole close to Jem and said: "That clerk from the police department wrote everything down. If the reporters in the newspaper see that record, how can you stop them from using it?" When Sharon spoke, she looked very anxious, but Jem Brown had a different opinion. He only replied: "Well, this matter has become too fierce." He had long forgotten his promise to Sharon on how to help her. But Sharon could not bear it anymore. She said to Jem: "Didn't you say that you could help me so that my friend's name would not be used by them indiscriminately? Now you seem indifferent. All you want is to get into this door. I have been used by you again." Her red lips were obviously trembling with anger.</p>
<p>After she finished speaking, without waiting for him to answer, she went upstairs alone. In a room upstairs, they were questioning Pennister. He came voluntarily to mourn and comfort Henry Patterson, because Patterson was the suspect in the murder of his wife. Patterson looked haggard and even more confused. He did not remember what happened the night before, but he always scorned and refused to accept Pennister's crocodile tears. Sharon went upstairs and stood beside Pennister, holding his arm with one hand and saying: "This is difficult for you."</p>
<p>Pennister said: "I really can't believe that Henry would murder his wife." At this time, Jem Brown had already walked up to them. After hearing Pennister's words, he interjected: "That's right. I also don't believe that Henry is the murderer of his wife. But I guessed who did it." Pennister said: "Really?" Jem said: "Really! It's you!" Sharon's face was suddenly covered with a layer of gray frost. She pulled Pennister and said: "Tommy, ignore him. Mr. Brown is unfortunately too funny. It's a pity that he doesn't understand the importance of words."</p>
<p>At this time, Sharon's hatred for Jem Brown could be said to be extreme. Let him think about what relationship Pennister had with this case. Let him spread rumors in his newspaper. Let him do whatever he wants. He is putting himself in that position. She understood very well. She was clearly with Pennister on the night of the incident. This was her time to retaliate against Jem Brown. Let him publish bizarre news. One day, the truth would come out, and he would be ridiculed by the public. She was waiting quietly for that day.</p>
<p>But she didn't have to wait long. That afternoon, the news was already printed with a big headline. The first line was written in large characters: "Police Department Questions Pennister." When Sharon saw that newspaper, she immediately ran to Mr. Jordan, the owner of the news company. She told him everything she knew from beginning to end. She said that she had warned Brown not to blindly guess at people's friendship, but he did not listen to her. She also said that for the sake of her friendship with Mr. Jordan and Mrs. Jordan, she did not want to see a valuable newspaper made a laughingstock by a foolish and self-righteous editor.</p>
<p>After Jordan listened to Sharon's long speech, he immediately called Jem Brown in. As soon as Jem Brown entered the door, he saw Sharon and said: "Are you here to provide some real news?" Jordan said sternly: "Miss Sharon is not here to provide any real news. She is here to point out your mistakes. She knows that all your guesses are wrong. I am very grateful to her that she can warn me like this. You... you are too imprudent about this matter." (To be continued)</p>
