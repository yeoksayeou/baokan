<p>時評</p>
<h3>海軍問題與美遠東政策</h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>六月問英德海軍協定成立後。英國滿擬於十月間召開海軍會議。惟以遠東及歐洲政局。旣阢隉不安。海軍問題本身又繁複殊甚。海軍會議遂有欲開不得之苦。海軍問題之折衝。以英國活動最力。美日則各自堅壁淸野。靜待時局之推移。英國預定計畫。原擬先對法意兩方接洽。俟稍有端倪。卽與日本談判。惟自意阿發生爭端。法意無暇與英談判海軍。日本則以太平洋方面。美國為其勁敵。任何協定。苟無美國參加。卽無多大意義。更以國際時局巳起劇變。大有居奇以索善價之勢。英國對日單獨交涉之策略。遂不若對德之順利。今以地中海風雲險惡。遠東英艦頗多調動。更不得不再謀對日妥協。以安其遠東方面之地位矣。</p>
<p>英國保守黨中「死硬派」之每日郵報及每日快報日來盛傳英將以援引倫敦條約第二十一條之「愛斯卡留托」條文事照會美國。此說業經倫敦美大使向美國務院否認。惟羅斯福總統日前出發巡視太平洋岸時。首先發表聲明。謂美將貫澈其原來之海軍政策云云。似係上項風說之反響。蓋英方之欲援引「愛斯卡留托」條文。月前倫敦每日電報卽曾作一度之傳述。當時日外務省且巳表示反對矣。</p>
<p>當一九三〇年倫敦海軍條約訂立之時。法意二國海軍平等問題爭執不决。約中遂載入所謂「愛斯卡留托」（義卽活動梯）一條。准許英美日三國中之任何一國。於國家安全感受威脅時。得通告援引該條增造補助艦。最近之英德海軍協定。亦有是項規定。英國今日正處於英印海洋交通受意國威脅之時。不能謂其絕無援引該條之心。惟美日二國旣巳先後表示反對。則海軍談判之複雜局勢中。又增一糾紛之因素矣。</p>
<p>羅斯福總統日前對於海軍問題之宣言。其動機固出于英報試探性之宣傳。惟其作用則仍在針對日本。蓋英美卽有海軍競爭。必不若美日競爭關係之重大。而美國之海軍政策與遠東問題尤有密切關係也。</p>
<p>美國遠東政策。據吾人觀察。不外兩途。一為消極的。一為積極的可借美國兩學者之言。以作說明。據坡杜大學敎授薛亞士博士云。『美國對於遠東。雖偶有憤懣之威。然歷來美國遠東政策恒以親善為其某調。則今後自亦仍謀親善。至於開放門戶政策是否尙有意義。頗不易言。現政府是否夢想以實力制裁為其後盾。今亦無徵象可見。』此乃對于前一傾向之觀察也。又據華盛頓大學敎授浦賴德博士云。『當前美國之遠東政策。其最後目標有二。一為經濟的。卽在保持中國市塲之通商機會均等。亦卽確守開放門戶政策之某礎。另一目標為政治的。卽在維護華盛頓會議所樹立之太平洋方面和平制度。此二方針現與日本之政策發生公開衝突。美國人民類皆以對日作戰兩敗俱傷為慮。美政府因思僅以壓力加諸日本。其方法有三。（一）堅守不承認主義。（二）劃阿留申羣島為防區（三）準備造艦競爭。美政府之預算雖未平衡。美國財力。足負造艦巨費。若持之以久。不甘落後之日本必疲子追隨。此三種壓力。雖代替戰爭為出發點。恐仍不免以戰爭為歸宿耳。』此則對于後一傾向之觀察也。</p>
<p>然就最近局勢以觀。美國七十四屆議會通過本年度國防費。數達美金十萬萬元。美國得地之利。為世界最不易受敵之國。而其軍費之鉅。在全世界可謂無出其右。今者羅斯屬總統又有貫澈海軍政策之宣言。美國對于海軍問題之態度。至此愈益顯明。其在遠東政策上之反映。寗非有積極的傾向乎。</p>

<h3>英國重申立塲　不欲離國聯作單獨行動</h3>
<p>國聯決定制裁須適合兩原則　務使世界有勢力國家均圈入　對中日案軟弱無能說明苦衷</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間官塲今日說明英國對於意阿問題之態度、謂英國不欲離國聯而作單獨行動、英當局在現有危局中擁護國聯、巳盡其本份、意阿爭議能否有迅速解决、全視他國如何盡其本份而定、如國聯竟無效力、則英國民衆勢必不復注意於國聯、是以欲使和平解决國際爭議機關保持完整、則各國政府必須一致積極擁護之、他日國聯如决定制裁辦法、則此辦法必須與下述兩原則相適合、（一）凡有勢力之國家皆須圈入、（二）必不可因非會員國之行為而致失敗、第二項在實施經濟制裁時尤關重要、以現象觀之、美國不致妨害國聯之行動、而德國亦不致魯莽行事、致牽入爭議漩渦中、意相墨索里尼近曾稱、英國在今年一月間巳知意國在阿比西尼亞之願望、但遲至六月間閣員艾登游羅馬時、英國始說明其態度、查此說殊欠正確、自去年十二月華爾華爾事件發生以來、英國幾無一星期而不明白表示其對於意國政策之惶慮、而尤注重意國政策在集體安全制度上之影饗、如謂英政府容許意國發生幻想、則殊無理由、關於今後問題、現雖無戰爭發生可以避免之希望、然英國將就其力量所及、從國聯機關獲取最好結果、務使戰爭儘速終了、至于日本侵滿、英國默無舉動，而意阿爭議則英國態度强硬之責言、則須知國聯未有俄美二國之參加、不能在滿洲有何舉動，但今日國聯能積極處理意阿爭議、英國未有理由可行其袖手旁觀之政策云、英官塲又聲明英政府幷非為私人利益而行其政策、英國固負有代埃及與蘇丹保護柴那湖之義務、但英國不願進行湖上設壩之計畫、足見英國願意以自己利益為輕、而以國聯政策之普遍而更重要之需求為重也云、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）茲悉英政府對於制裁問題、除向法國徵求具體表示、並曾向國聯其他會員國作同樣之探詢、（一日國民電）</p>

<h3>軍事合作問題　英靜待法答覆</h3>
<p>法態度決於明日閣議</p>
<p>（倫敦）外傳英國政府曾向法國詢問、如地中海英國艦隊一旦遭他國侵犯、則法國採取何種態度、此說頃巳由官方加以徵實、官方人士以為英國提出此項問題、並無向法國討價還價之意、蓋英國對於歐洲安全問題之觀點、巳在目前霍爾外相致法國政府之覆文中、加以指陳、不問法國觀點若何、英國此種態度旣經確定、决不變更云、又聞法國政府在本星期五日內閣會議之前、不至答復英國此項問題、政界人士預料法國政府復文、或將贊成於必要時援助地中海英國艦隊、但以維持集體安全之原則為限、倘採取更進一步之約束、則法國恐尙有所躊躇、按霍爾外相亦曾聲明、在國聯會行政院投票通過關於意阿問題之建議書以前、不能有所行動、可見英法兩國海軍倘欲合作、必在國聯會範圍內而後可也、（一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法內閣將於星期五日午後集議、同時據報紙評論、英國所向法國探詢如意艦突然攻擊地中海之英艦隊、法國將取何態度一節、法政府究將如何答覆、今未能逆料、辯論報表示意見、法政府之覆文决不致豫作定見、又稱法國今可絕對自由答吿英國、法政府無千涉阿案之志、蓋吾人深信法國一方面尊重國聯之原則、一方面不應對於目前之案件參與制裁也云、協和報之言論甚至更形堅决、覆故意犧牲意國之友誼、而加入法國無所得失之冒險企圖、不獲英國之絲毫報酬實屬大愚云、（二日路透電）</p>
<h3>英法要人重要會談</h3>
<p>（巴黎）英法兩國要人今日在此繼續舉行重要會議、法國外部發言人向美聯社記者稱、此次歐洲危機如發生戰事、則法國將什九助英、法總理兼外長賴伐爾今日與英國大使克拉克會晤之後、英國皇儲卽在英國大使館邀賴伐爾及法國軍界要人午宴、今日之談話、此間人士皆視為非常重要、因英法二國方互相要求保證、據悉雙方曾談及國聯表决對意實施制裁之後、英國在地中海之地位問題、最重要者為法國之態度、蓋實施制裁之後、意國或將獨指英國為故意挑釁、而要求法國助意反英也、英國要求法國表示、英意兩國如在地中海發生衝突、法國取何態度、法國內閣已定於星期五開會討論、（一日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）每日快報今日消息、法國總理兼外長賴伐爾已向英國駐法大使克拉克保證、如意國未受挑釁、卽向英國攻擊、則法國之海軍及空軍將完全與英國軍隊合作云、（二日國民電）</p>
<h3>意報言論離間英法</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意國輿論對於英法兩國態度尙未絕望、以為法國海軍不致在地中海參加制裁行動、卽英國仍當與意國進行友誼談判、而以尊重東菲洲意國利益為談判基礎、羅馬人民報載稱、「法國不致參加制裁行動、以殘害兄弟之邦、而卒以自殺、」至官塲人土、則恐英國政府當向美德兩國政府施以壓力、俾强其參加制裁行動云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>引起羅馬痛苦印象</h3>
<p>（羅馬）英國致法之牒文、已引起羅馬痛苦之印象、衆信英國必存心封鎖意國、始發出此項牒文、對鎖之舉、唯國聯可以實施、今英當局在國聯未作此决議之前、已圖作此準備、意人皆視為不友好之行動、意人現重行聲明意國並無不利於英之企圖、且不欲將對阿戰事擴及歐洲、當意國竭力避免與英國發生衝突、且挽回戰爭之機會仍然存在之際、而乃從事促成戰禍、實屬荒謬云、（二日路透電）</p>
<h3>英工黨大會決議　主對意施制裁</h3>
<p>（倫敦）工黨大會今日以大多數通過一議案、贊成工黨執委主張國聯於意阿開戰時適用制裁之政策、計贊成此提案者二·一六八·〇〇〇票、反對者僅一〇二·〇〇〇票、倫敦市議會工黨議員領袖莫理遜結束制裁辯論時、切言國聯雖有種種缺點、但為世界之初期太上政府、國戰所造成者唯此尙可差强人意、莫氏並稱、軍事制裁不能刪除、如國聯在此次事件中遭遇失敗、則多少必歸於終止而無限期、渠以為英國各殖民地軍應置於國聯之下、此非言英殖民地應不再受英國之保護、渠仍覺英國為全世界最適宜之統治殖民地者云、（二日路透電）</p>

<h3>德奧匈乘機　恢復三國同盟說</h3>
<p>德向奧提議五年不侵犯條約　惟柏林方面認此說全無根據</p>
<p>（維也納）據今日可靠方面消息、德元首希特勒已訓令駐粵德大使巴本向奧政府提前締結五年不侵犯條約、據聞如奧國願與德國締結此約、則德政府願予以下述之讓步、（一）停止德奧境內反對奧政府之宣傳、並解散德境內之粵籍軍隊、（二）德國多購奧貨、（三）取消馬克千枚之封鎖、德政府同時要求奧政府如下、（一）停止仇德之態度、並參加德波匃間之聯盟、（二）停止奧境內對國社黨員而施之嚴峻警政法、（三）逐漸釋放被覊於拘留所中之國社黨員、聞上述計畫巳得匃總理貢波土及奧總理許希尼格之同意、按貢氏最近來游柏林、與此事有密切關係、惟奧副總理兼內衛團領袖史泰漢堡對此提議反對頗烈、蓋彼之勢力將因此而受打擊也、駐奧德使巴本刻在德國參加興登堡總統之葬禮、大約在返維也納後、卽將與奧外長商磋一切、（二日路透電）</p>
<p>（柏林）此間官塲謂、德國向奧政府要求締結不侵犯條約一說、全無根據、（二日路透電）</p>

<h3>海軍問題　英國官方意見分歧</h3>
<p>擴充海軍與靜待交涉　日外務海軍協議覆文</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國海軍專家舉華德頃在每日電報發表一文、詳述官方人士對於海軍政策所抱各種不同之見解、謂官方意見可分兩派、一派主張立卽充實海軍軍備除將艦齡屆滿之舊艦悉行掉換外、更應添造新艦、另一派則反對立卽擴充海軍、謂此舉有引起英美日三國造艦競爭之虞、按美國羅斯福總統於九月二十九日啟程前往太平洋岸時、曾發表演說、說明美國政府所探海軍政策、言外之音、似對英國提出警吿、謂倫敦及華盛頓海軍條約廢止後所發生之後果、應由英國負其資任、英國主張添造新艦一派人士、卽以羅斯福此項演說為其根據、而堅持英國必須儘速行動、俾免後患、關於此層、政府現雖已通過大規模造艦程序、但必俟英國與其他各關係國海軍談話獲得結果後、始乃决定造艦細目云、（二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務及海軍兩省協議日政府對英政府關於軍縮會議通吿之答覆、結果决定表示日本軍縮方針不變、並重復說明日本方針、以整備不威脅不侵略之海軍兵力為目的、而請求英當局考慮此事、其覆文現由外務省起草、將於四日交閣議、經正式决定後、卽電訓駐英代理大使以口頭致答英外交部、據聞其內容如下、</p>
<p>（一）日本軍縮方針已經在去秋預備交涉時及八月二十一日覺書說明、內容確定不變、再無考慮餘地、日政府為舉軍縮之實起見、主張廢除一切形態之比率主義、以確立平等軍備、</p>
<p>（二）英國如承認此項根本方針、則在日本有參加會議準備、但量的制限與質的制限應於同時實施、因單獨實施質的制限、專利大海軍國、日本絕對加以反對、（二日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）聞外務省已開始與海軍省會商英國所提出召集海軍大會之建議、惟日本海軍政策早由內閣决定、故討論之結果、無提交內閣之必要、日本所欲者、為眞正之軍縮、廢除攻勢之武器、連戰艦與飛機母艦在內云、（二日路透電）</p>

<h3>游泳對抗　港滬華聯大勝西聯</h3>
<p>西聯人馬零落九比十八大敗　二百公尺接力打破全國紀錄</p>
<p>滬港華聯對上海西聯之游泳對抗比賽、昨晚仍在市游泳池舉行、華聯以十八比九分、大勝西聯、分數適相差一倍、西聯方面因人馬不齊、且俱係第二流選手、故勝來極為容易、女子組西女子完全缺席、故祇得由楊秀瓊等作單獨表演、興趣集中之水球、華聯亦以四比一大獲勝利、傑寗與勃倫脫之滑稽跳水表演、突梯滑稽、二千觀衆、掌聲與笑聲不絕、亦比賽中一有趣之點綴、昨晚觀衆之盛、較之前晚、有過無不及、</p>
<p>五十公尺敗得可惜</p>
<p>五十公尺自由式、為比賽最精彩之一幕、因西聯之勃力登、為本年上海埠際選手、在港以一綫之差為陳振興所敗、頗不甘於心、昨晚兩人冉度相逢、俱出全力競爭、惜乎振興以落水稍遲、至為程過短、到達終點、為勃力登以一肩之差所敗、不勝可惜</p>
<p>一百公尺突破紀錄</p>
<p>陳振興在五十公尺中屈居第二、在一百公尺自由式中、乃大顯身手、西聯之史丹可司基頗能頑强抵抗、在八十公尺中、竟與陳振興、難解難分、不分前後、直至最後之十五公尺處、陳才一躍居前、終以三米之遙、將史丹可司基轉敗、李羅敏第三、梁倖生缺席、檢視紀錄、陳為一分六秒七、與全國紀錄一分六秒六、僅差十分之一秒耳、</p>
<p>仰泳俯泳華聯包辦</p>
<p>一百公尺仰泳及一百公尺俯泳、竟全為華聯所包辦、俯泳西人祇出席來恩一人、仰泳亦一人為倍倫子、結果此二人完全落選、原是西聯中之第三流選手也、</p>
<p>女子比賽改爲表演</p>
<p>女子比賽因西女子之缺席、故臨時改為表演比賽、先由楊秀瓊楊秀珍陳鳳英三人、表演五十公尺自由式、結果秀瓊第一、秀珍第二、陳第三、成績三十六秒七、較楊之三十八秒二全國紀錄為佳、但不及前晚之三十六秒紀錄、次楊秀瓊單獨表演一百公尺仰泳、未曾計時、區恩照亦單獨表演二百公尺蛙式、因無競爭、成績為三分四十九秒、區僅十三齡、在港曾以三分三十五秒之成績、破二百公尺蛙式全國紀錄、在全運中、區為有希望人才之一、</p>
<p>跳水表演突梯滑稽</p>
<p>跳水表演先有花式跳水表演、參加者亨勃、格力克、倍倫斯、黃錫渶、及詐珠瑞等五人、西人都屬此中好手、不特姿式美觀、花樣亦百出、黃錫漢亦堪與比擬、許較差耳、次由傑寗勃倫脫二人、作滑稽跳水表演、化裝小丑、在跳板上作種種之滑稽落水、引得滿塲大笑、掌聲大作、二人不特滑稽、耶跳水技術、亦頗不差也、</p>
<p>接力雖敗成績可觀</p>
<p>二百公尺接丈泳、華聯人選如下、（一）徐亨、（二曾河福、（二）李羅敏、（四）陳振興、一二兩人、與西人並肩而進、惜李羅敏落水稍遲、致第四人陳振興力趕不及、敗於勃力登五公尺、華聯之成績為一分五十八秒六、雖列第二、却破二分一秒一之全國紀錄、西聯成續一分五十七秒六、相差一秒、</p>
<p>水球比賽華聯大勝</p>
<p>壓軸戲水球比賽、華聯以四比二大勝、聯絡方面、極為純熟、射門亦佳、聞西聯之出席者、為亞靑水球隊之乙組、毫無聯絡、與華聯實力、相差太遠、前半局華聯速進三球、後半局西聯奪回一球、華聯亦中、西聯再得一球、結果成四比二、華聯陣綫如下、</p>

<h3>小男兒（六四）</h3>
<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>其時拂朗還在讀書，等到他　罷離開自修室的時候，聞到煙氣，趕上樓去，看見這個，竟加雲頭一般冉冉地從房子的左翼出來，他覺得再也沒有工夫去叫起別人，便立刻跑進房裏將兩個童子從火勢熊熊的床上拖了出來，把手邊所有的水都向火燄上澆去。火勢稍殺，然而火尙不就此熄滅，那兩個童子被倒拖到了冷弄堂裏，業已清醒過來，開始拼命狂喊。裴夫人立刻到了塲，不久賴司務衝出他自己的房間，喊着「救火」！他的聲昔把全屋子驚起了。一群白衣的小精靈帶着驚惶的神色都叢集到門弄堂裏，一時人人都像是被恐懼所攝服，竟覺得不知所措。</p>
<p>不久裴夫人首先恢復了她的機警，吩咐納綏照應被灼傷的童子，又命拂朗和賴司務到樓下把幾桶的濕衣服端上來，她就立刻將這些濕衣服投向那床上，地毯上以及窗帘上，因爲這些現在已燒得很旺，其勢已經要延燒四璧了。</p>
<p>多數和童子只是呆立望着，惟有唐恩和愛彌奮着勇氣搶救，不斷地奔往浴室裏去取水，並且帮著拉下危險的門帘。</p>

<p>貢獻話</p>
<h3>國貨界應放遠眼光</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨界於今日，應自力更生，打開新出路，以與世界工商業競爭，纔不致受自然之淘汰，决不當跼蹐內地，專事模倣，人云亦云，以自陷於絕境。卽如展覽會一事，記者曾屢下忠吿，舉辦老應極早改弦易轍，另闢新途徑，乃一般人惑於小利，動於好勝，一舉再舉，連續不斷，當地商人反對不問也，地方團體拒絕不問也，致人以流寇目之，徒結當地熱心販賣國貨商人之惡感，悍然不顧，何計之左，一至如此。吾嘗謂國貨展覽不改良，以後展覽之國貨，將取厭於各地，而各地商人或有不願販賣國貨之一旨。蓋舉辦此會者，挾各工廠以自重，恃免稅之美名，以從事銷貨，而不思當地販賣商，非不愛國，早有同樣之出品，平日售給當地之用戶，今舉辦者，不顧名思義，用展覽之名，行傾銷之實，以同樣之貨品，賣不同等之價格，其自為計則得矣，其如當地販賈商何？故余嘗勸國貨商，與其加入展覽會，結各地商人之惡感，不如專派幹員，分赴各地調査接洽，聽取各地商人之意見與顧客之心理，以得到一般的好感與批評，藉以改進自身之出品。好徵逐，趕熱鬧，轉以失去各地之主顧，非徒無益，而又害之，掬誠忠吿，幸恕戇直。抑又有進者，今日國貨界應放遠眼光，注意於國際貿易，欲制入超，先須獎勵出口，南洋一帶，尤為我國貨界之絕大出路。目下實業部國際貿易，中華工業國外貿易協會，旣努力贊助國貨廠商，推銷國貨。最近國際貿易協會新總幹事張禹九君，為最熱心國貨之同志，記者知其極願為國貨界服務，吾國貨界應與之切實合作，遇有種種問題，可以與之商榷必能得滿意之效果也。</p>
<h3>國貨界聞人的痛心話</h3>
<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>前天偶然看到新夜報載黃寄萍訪問幾位上海實業界聞人的談話，這幾位努力提倡國貨的聞人，彷彿是立在我國對外經濟戰綫上紮硬寨打死仗的前方戰將。他們說出來的話，句句是苦辣辣刺人心腑的。我在這裏，不辭拾人牙慧之議，把它揭出來給大家作個當頭棒喝。</p>
<p>「……提起了呢絨一項，我國眞是虧損不小。許多穿西裝的靑年人，尤其是大學生，都鄙視國產呢絨。偏要穿著外國貨。唉！什麽學生國貨年，前途眞不堪設想。」——（劉鴻生先生的話）</p>
<p>「……如果閉著眼睛去吸中外各種捲烟，就辨不出孰優孰劣。烟味也沒有多大高下。所以我想喜吸外國烟的人，除了自炫闊綽以外，並無其他作用的。」——（吳蘊初先生的話）</p>
<p>「大陸商塲中國國貨公司那一樣東西沒有，而他們過門不入，要鑽進三大公司去買來路貨。那有什麽辦法。試一訪政府機關及高貴的家庭，所備烟酒往往是洋貨。似乎非如此不足顯示其闊綽。……」——（方液仙先生的話）</p>
<p>「……電泡的銷路一年不如一年。主要原因是市塲縮小了。像東北失守，國貨絕跡。現在的華北，好比東北一樣；總之形勢一變，國貨就絕了生路。……」——（胡西園先生的話。</p>
<p>「…宣傳國貨，在中下級的人巳見成效。惟有上流社會，他們有的是　，只要吃著得舒服，管他洋貨國貨。劣等心裏見諸上流社會，着實使人寒心……」——（王性堯先生的話）</p>
<p>「日本人以吸外國烟用外國貨為恥；我國人以吸外國烟用外國貨為闊。……」——（潘仰堯先生的話）</p>
<p>目下歐菲之間，劍拔弩張，戰爭已迫在眉睫。依據上海銀行調査部的宣示，戰事發生以後，我國土產運銷歐洲各國及北非洲的如花生，茶葉，豆類，蛋類，繭絲，地毯，草蓆等類，都要因地中海的運輸中梗而大减銷路，戰事延長一年，出口貨額便要减少七千萬元以上。至於因戰事而牽動東亞局勢，又當別論。</p>
<p>現代軍事的戰爭準備，我們旣落後得無法自衛；剝床及膚的經濟戰爭，又久已陷於轍亂旗靡。日常生活的需要物品，還不儘量的採用國貨，這就準對着一步步走上滅亡之路了！</p>
<p>我知道一般看報的人，除了看看國際及本國大局的動態，各色驚異的社會新聞，娛樂的小品文字，影刊，畫刊以外，絕少留意到有類說敎而不足聳動聽聞的宣傳文章的。尤其是所謂旣富且貴的上流社會，崇尙摩登的時代靑年，他們自身旣不經意，旁人勸吿的話也是無門可入。那還有什麼好說呢！</p>
<h3>學生國貨年的過去與未來</h3>
<p>— 朱慰萱</p>
<p>猗歟盛哉的學生國貨年，一貶眼就已過去了三分之二，但是我們試一回顧過去的成績，說來却也實在有些寒心；學生們，非僅在這學生國貨年裏沒有顯著的成績，和相當的貢獻；而且矛盾惰形畸形狀態，不絕地展開在我們的面前。此誠非僅學生國貨年的汚點，且亦中國整個民族的奇恥大辱！</p>
<p>至於學生國貨年最矛盾之點，那莫過於大學生的西裝革履，出入舞塲，開香檳，吃大菜，口嚼留蘭香，髮塗司丹康，無一不是十足道地的舶來品。雖則在過去某一個時期裏，曾有人主張禁止大學生跳舞，但是事過境遷，現在大學生又復活躍於舞塲了！</p>
<p>中學生本來對於社會團體活動是很努力而肯苦幹的；但是在今年這學生國貨年裏，似乎也沒有特殊的成績。或許因為大學生的背道而馳，完全忘了學生國貨年重大使命的緣故吧？所以他們也起而效尤，放棄了自己的責任，對於國貨運動，非特沒有積極向外發展和推進；而且自已的書桌上，大部仍放着華脫門的墨水，胸前揷着派克的自來水筆，把學生國貨年艱巨的責任，完全置在腦後！</p>
<p>關於小學生，假使沒有父兄師長隨時灌輸他們國貨的敎育，那恐怕根本不懂所謂學生國貨年的意義，我們時常可以看到幼稚園的小學生，興奮地在玩着外國的玩具。不禁使我擲筆三歎！</p>
<p>往者已矣，來者可追。過去這許多畸形事跡不絕地出現，固然使我們痛心嗟嘆；但是這絕對不是消極的感嘆，所能濟事；我們要希望於未來；在未來的三四個月中，我們要以眞實有力的成績來贖過去麻木不仁的罪愆！</p>
<p>全國的學生們！國家未來的主人翁你們是受過敎育的智識份子，你們應站在先知先覺的立塲，此後非但自己要以身作則的處處服用國貨；而且要勸吿家人推而至於社會上無論那一個人，都要使他們認識國貨，採用國貨；同時對於小學生更要隨時隨地的灌輸他們國貨的敎育與常識，使他們小小的腦筋中，就深深地印着國貨的印象，從小就養成他們服用國貨的習慣！</p>
<p>最後還有一點是值得提出來討論的：就是各大中學每年出的年鑑，和畢業紀念冊等類的刊物，大都皮面燙金，裝釘精美，考其紙張，全都來自外洋。非但每年利權外溢，漏巵可觀，而且在學生國貨年的現在，以包括全校精華概况的冊子，所印紙張，均非國貨，也是極大的矛盾；一旦傳到外人手裏，更將貽人譏笑！所以這點我也希望主事者在付印之前，加以考慮注意，不要只圖形式外表的美，而就不顧刊物本身的價值，留下莫大的汚點！</p>

<p>要研究科學，我們不能够祇靠着一枝毛筆，正因為這個原故，鋼筆頭對於我們形成了一個很好的銷路，我們不能眼看着一箱箱鋼筆頭進來，一批批白銀子出去，所以我們要喊了，「我們需要國貨鋼筆頭」！</p>
<p>聽到的人也許會說：「外國貨鋼筆頭你們自會用，中國的自來水鋼筆不是很好的嗎？看！這是華孚，這是新民，這是博士，……。」但是這位朋友的話說得太「寫意」了，自來水筆，卽使是中國貨的自來水筆試問要幾塊錢一支？在現在五百畝錢才能够供給一個人讀書的時侯，誰有餘錢能買自來水筆呢？我們買不起自來水筆，而却要鋼筆頭。</p>
<p>這裏讓我來貢獻些意見，使得我們有國貨的鋼筆頭好用。</p>
<p>（一）政府或商人設廠製造我們現在且從中學生算起，到大學生為止，別的姑不算。我們知道，中國現有中大學生共五五三·四一四人，設以每人每月用一只，每年一打，那麽鋼筆頭的銷路，就有這五十餘萬打。在這一個大數目裏，政府或商人倘若肯設一個廠來製造，那末雖抱薄利主義，我想，牠的利益一定不少，何况用鋼筆頭的人，不只是學生，而廠裏除了鋼筆頭以外，還可以增出如鋼筆桿等等的東西。</p>
<p>（二）自來水筆廠附出自來水筆廠附出鋼筆頭，也是個很好的辦法，因為自來水筆的頭，和普通鋼筆的頭，在形式上差得不多，假若自來水筆廠肯利用一部分機械的力，將機器少微變更來製造普通鋼筆頭，那末以極輕的錢用以變更機器的資本，一定可以得到許多酬報。</p>
<p>以上方法，（一）或（二），我希望在最短時期內有個實現，鋼筆頭雖小，但是我們忽略不得，我們要知道，牠的漏巵却是很大的呢。</p>
<h3>追記南湖賞月與提倡國貨</h3>
<p>— 孫籌成</p>
<p>本刊天然君所撰之「棉毛衫子話南湖」稿，不禁憶及中秋在鴛鴦湖畔，為風姨雨師所迫，而添購禦寒衣服之笑史，事關提倡國貨，爰將是日經過情形，錄實本刊，諒亦熱心提倡國貨諸同志所願聞也。今歲友聲旅行團發起在南湖賞月，烟雨樓夜宴後，參加者有三百人之多，全國新藥業同業公會聯合會同事孫鳴歧賢伉儷，皆在其內，孫君因予原籍嘉興，對於禾中名勝較熟，送來車票一張，邀余同往，故人情重，碍難推却，故於是日上午七時赴站，啟輪後見五和織造廠經理任士剛，中華琺瑯廠經理方劍閣，鴻新布廠經理胥仰南，伉儷均在，相與寒暄後，方君謂潘仰堯君，本擬同來，因事未果，故由渠之女公子世銓女士代表，言時幷指潘女士而為予介紹，略與閒談，知其已在四行儲蓄會服務，態度大方，出言雋雅，足徵家學淵源，與衆不同，虎父不生犬子，洵然。抵禾後先游鐵路苗圃，植菊甚多，惜為時尙早，均未開放，繼赴東塔寺，謁朱買臣墓，車少人多，角里街上頓時擁擠，墓在塔北，卽予家舊宅之後，蔓草荒烟中，有一石碑直立，人皆涉足叢草，前往注視，僉謂苟無馬前潑水之京劇，民衆心目中，對於此人不致若是之重視，然則渠之成名，實乃妻崔氏所造成。十一時登舟，至烟雨樓，或赴寳梅亭賞鑒彭剛直所畫之梅，或至雷祖殿參觀觀世音等之像，中膳後赴三塔，觀血印和尙，中途風雨交加，天氣驟冷，抵茶禪寺，各人均現瑟縮之象。經予吿以血印和尙，是茶禪寺住僧，名妙諦，明嘉靖間倭寇東南，據婦孺，拘於是寺，妙諦聞哭泣聲，動菩提念醉守卒而盡釋之，守卒醒後，恨之刺骨，將其綁於石坊，積薪焚死，而現是影，迄今數百年，依舊未退。民國十五年。危道豐任嘉興知事時，慕其忠義，特立碑表揚之事實後，衆始恍然，因事關民族性，僉義形於色，宛似挾纊，而不覺冷。三時繞西城而赴杉靑閘時，天氣更冷，接近市塵，僉往塘灣街購棉毛衫以抵禦，予謂同舟諸君日市上外貨充斥，須特別注意，國貨中以五和之鵝牌為最著名可以試用，衆皆贊同，購歸後，衫上均印一鵝，予顧謂王君曰，足下之老祖宗義之先生，茍今日在此，對於此種鵝牌棉毛衫，不知欲如何手舞足蹈矣。衆皆軒渠入夜在烟雨樓夜宴時，嫦娥避匿未出，雨師風姨仍大肆其威，致羅袖生寒，幸賴此棉毛衫以抵抗，否則勢難支持，故對於五和織造廠，頗多好威。任君伉儷，遂笑逐顏開，有一部分人，購棉毛衫未得者，均將三友實業社之毛巾權充圍巾云。</p>

<p>國貨油毡新出品　（雙錘牌）</p>
<p>建築師曹君克東，上海人，專心研究建築事業，於民元初即應天津法工部局之聘，服務近二十年，凡華北各大埠之著名建築物，多賴其規劃。曹君尤喜研究建築材料，如組織裕東磚瓦公司，開明電業公司等，成績斐然。近以建築材料中油毡一項，無國貨出品，皆需用外貨，金錢外溢，殊為可惜！特悉心研究其原料及成分，且自造專製油毡機器，毫不借外力，經三年餘之苦心研究，始於去歲夏，組織建華油毡公司，製成雙錘牌完全國貨油毡數種，華北各省，早經採用，僉認為質地優良，可駕乎舶來品之上，定價尤極低廉。現經實業部註冊備案，予有商標專用權，此次應國貨建築材料展覽會之陳列，備有樣品多種，供各大建築家參考，藉資提倡國貨，而挽權利。</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （天虛我生）</p>
<p>你不要嫌熱，你如果拿自己和種田的人一比，你就心平氣和，覺得自己實在是太煩躁了。</p>
<p>臣心如水，拿心來比水，比得最為切當，心熱不如心冷，因為熱到了沸點相近，他就要被煎熬化氣，直到煎煏使乾為止，若要他不煎熬時也很便當，只須離火，冷冷便好。</p>
<p>人心的冷熱，正與水之冷熱相同，由於天者少由於人者多，一年四季之中，熱到C氏三十八度，冷到零度的時候，實在是極少的，俗語說大冷不過三日，大熱不過三日，足見一年三百六十五日之中，僅僅祗此六日而已，可謂難得之至，然而人力可以勝天，他用煤火來煎熬，用　氣來吸逼，立刻可以使水　化汽成洋，這豈不是人造的嗎？</p>
<p>起頃熱之念者，大都為飽暖而不知足之人，若使其人感受到飢寒的壓迫，而求免於凍餒，他就奔走呼號於烈日之下，縱使汗流浹背，五中如焚，他决不想用雷風冷汽來抵抗這煩熱。</p>
<h3>駐菲意軍的軍糧</h3>
<p>— 佩萸</p>
<p>在此意阿戰爭準備揭幕的緊張情勢之中，却有兩種商人大發其橫財。第一種發大財的是軍火商，第二種發小財的是水菜商。軍火商的大主顧是阿國，水菜商的大主顧是意國。阿國自己不會製造軍火，一定要向國外採辦，這一筆大生意，軍火商早已算定，逃走不脫的。但是水菜商對於意國的這批交易，却是意料所不及，眞是「外快」生意。意國曾採辦大批的　檬與橘子，運到菲洲意屬伊里特里亞和索馬里蘭兩處地方去，作駐紮菲洲屬地的軍隊給養。</p>
<p>駐紮在索馬里蘭地方的意大利兵士，每日每人派給三隻橘子或檸檬，但是在伊里特里亞地方的意兵，每人每兩日派得一份這種水菓。因為伊里特里亞的地勢比較索馬蘭里來得高，氣候也是比較適於衛生，水菜的需要比較小些，所以軍糧中的一種水菓，略為减少。這種水菓對於在熱帶地方的軍隊健康，非常有益；尤其是檸檬，極其需要，在傷寒症的流行中，是一種必不可缺的救星。</p>
<p>除了水菓之外，每人每日還可派得一磅半的麵包，六英兩至九英兩的肉，六英兩的通心麵，三英兩半的馬鈴薯，二英兩的蔬菜，一英兩的烟草。每星期有兩次不用通心麵而換給同量的米。此外軍隊每日還供給少量的調味品，油，乾酪，和一英兩半的果子醬。在伊里特里亞的意兵，每人每日還發給半英兩的咖啡和四分之三英兩的糖；在索馬軍蘭的意兵，每人每日多得一倍。</p>
<h3>長虹讀畫記</h3>
<p>— 鄭逸梅</p>
<p>善夫聖歎氏之言曰：舞　之後，便欲溺管　文，則殊苦手顫，鐃吹之後，便欲洞蕭淸囀，則殊苦耳鳴，馳騎之後，便欲入班拜舞，則殊苦喘急，駡座之後，便欲舉唱梵唄，則殊苦喉燥」，不料古人之所難，而今人却能應付裕如，若無共事然者，則其天才洵足驚詫矣！我友謝君閒鷗，與沈心海金粟香朱良材三老，及任長年陳竹汀李蟠根諸子，結長虹盡社於尙文路何家支弄，日以研討繪事為樂，予一昨曾往訪之，則謝君方於便面上作螺殼道塲圖，山坡之側，坐二叟，閒觀一螺之翕張，以尺寸比例故，螺祗佔便面之一角，殼內緇流若干輩，方為佛事，經卷也，蒲團也，香花供品也，珠瓔大士灌頂寳光也，他如一案一凳，一鐘一鼓，一鐃一鈸，無不應有盡有，門前矗峙二燈座，旛幟且飄揚焉。君假以擴大鏡窺之，纖毫可辨，無一筆一墨之苟率，歎為奇妙，舉目四矚，則見壁上揭有丈疋之人物堂幅，神姿朗展，境局開拓，筆力之雄渾，蔑以復加，以較螺殼圖的一巨一細，判然若出兩手，諦視之，設色猶未乾也，謝君輟其工作，與予談人物畫理謂：「人物畫大都寫故事詩意，然屋宇几席車騎服飾，代有變遷，作者須考其時代，而加以支配，背景不論一樹一石，均當承合於俯仰轉側之間，章法宜簡而不荒，密而不紊，分晰前後，則遠近自現，距離須按分寸，高低應設賓主庶無偏重偏輕之病」，又云：「從事繪畫，當貫注全神，意存筆先，則筆勢自然勁暢」，凡此皆甘苦有得之言，學畫者所當奉為規法者也，君史出示三老及陳竹汀陳崖金灼灼李蟠根周小娜等山水花卉畫幀盎然古趣，為之玩賞移時，聞近來諸子盡興甚濃，方以廉潤與社會人士結翰墨囚綠云。</p>

<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十九回　大員惜羽敲門有術新歡離骨肉探病無由</p>
<p>你比我年紀大，你就是我親哥一般，親哥叫小兄弟作事，還用得着客氣什麽，你隨便差遺就是了。你若是不差遣我作事，那就是看着我不成材料，不要我這飯桶作朋友了。多才被他把話弄僵了倒不好意思不要他帮忙，便拱拱手道：這就只好請你累上一趟了。士廉更不等着第二句話，這就很快的向小西天的後門走來。選不曾到胡嫂子家裏，只望到他的大門，這就吃了一驚。一位瘦得像骷髏似的老太婆，就坐在他的大門框上，身子斜靠了十牆。身上的藍布褂子，總有二三十個大小補釘，盤了腿，將一條靑布褲，沾滿了黃土。那尖削的臉，皮膚是黃黑的，佈滿了皺紋，眼睛下陷，兩雙顴骨右撑，銀絲似的頭髮，在臉上披着。加之他那雙無神的眼睛，死命的向小西天後而釘着，分外的怕人，因之運遠的站站了。偏是那位老太婆，却不原諒人家害怕他，抬起一隻鷄爪子似的手，半彎着伸出兩個手指頭，向士廉指着，慢吞吞的道：老爺呀，你不是小西天裏的人嗎？你看見我家月英嗎？我病了。唉！我…想…他。士廉這就知道他正是月英的祖母。他旣是說出話來了，就是一個人，不用得怎麼害怕他了，便慢慢的靠近了他身邊，問道：老人家，你問的是買太太嗎？老太婆昻頭向他看看，合了巴掌連作兩個揖，顫巍巍的道：老爺，我是個要死的人。我到了年紀了，可以死了，這樣苦的日子，活着作什麽？我兩代人，就是那點親骨肉，為了百那塊錢，把他賣了。我…實在不想　他，他娘，那裏又捨得賣。只是我們住在親戚家，親戚也窮……（三三一）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>（不列章）作者與譯者的會見</p>
<p>在我所譯的「御香縹緲錄」快將刋戴完畢的當兒，忽然，像暴風雨一樣突兀的來了本書的原著人「德齡公主」，（公主的稱呼或許尙有疑問，但在伊本人沒有正式指正以前，祇能依舊沿用着。）這幾日以內，上海中西各報都紛粉刋載着伊的行動和談話。的確，自從這一部「御香縹緲錄」刊布以來，這個快將給人們忘掉的名字巳重復受許多人的注意了；而伊偏又適逢其會的重返故國，無怪每大上華懋飯店去見伊的人竟有那樣的多，甚至使伊感到不勝應對之苦了。</p>
<p>伊來的消息對於我自然更有一種特別的與奮，因為我雖巳這樣精細的把伊的作品翻譯了出來；並且於此得到了一個概念，知道伊是一個富於胆識而極愛說笑話的女性，但我和伊却始終未曾直接會面過。我旣然難於上美國去找伊，那末伊這一來我少不得總要去見伊一見了。可是事情眞不巧，近來我偏是異乎尋常的忙亂，晚上又因患失眠症的關係，打過八句鐘便非歇息不可了。以致再也沒有適當的時間可以去拜望這位美國化的中國太太。再加有一天我無意中翻閱字林西報，瞧見有一段關於俘的記載，中間有一節很荒謬的話，大約說「如今德齡公主已是一個沒有國藉的女人了，自從淸朝亡過之後，伊便失去了中國國民的資格，……。」不知道道些話究竟還是那缺乏常識的字林西報記者的意思呢，還是這價巳經美國化了的太太的意思啊？但無論怎樣，總使我看了很不高興；我難不敢自詡怎樣的熱心愛國，可是再要我去虔誠恭敬的拜訪一個分明是大中華民國的國民，面×自己偏願意充洋鬼子的人，卻委實有些不願，事情便這樣的耽擱了下來。（一）</p>

<h3>小常識</h3>
<p>— （楚玉）</p>
<p>辨別奶油的常識　奶油富於營養，但近年來，市上偽品很多，就是人造奶油冒充純粹奶油，所以我們對於品質，應當嚴密分辨，人造奶油是合成牛乳與其他種種脂肪，其營養分與維他命甚少，氣味亦不同。辨別的法，用刀切奶油一片，括在麵包上面，在架上用火烘時，若是純良的品質，那末，必有細泡起來，油溶解後，變為黃色，倘是人造奶油，那末細泡很少，而目要發出拍拍之聲，油溶解後，有白色的脂油凝固在上面的。</p>
<p>吃牛乳要防酸性品　牛乳中若混入檸檬與橘等酸性水果汁，那末，其酸與牛乳的蛋白質發生作用，就要凝固，吃了這牛乳，輕則消化不良，重則中毒。</p>
<p>揩眼鏡切忌麻布　如用麻布或綢絹的手巾揩拭，那要損傷鏡片，而且要變易鏡光，又眼鏡取下時，切不可把鏡的凸面，接觸桌面，應當把鏡夾支持，或仰置，普通用絨布揩鏡片，固然很宜，但是絨布用得過久，就與麻布相同，最好用細薄的紙片（眼鏡紙）揩拭。</p>
<p>防除鍋底結烟煤　飯鍋菜鍋的底，因燃薪煮物，必結黑煤，如要預防，可把鍋底先浸水，再用肥皂擦上，那末，燒時煤亦因肥皂溶解，不易厚結，若用水洗滌，煤亦容易脫落。比普通用剷刀刮煤，省力得多。</p>
<p>香烟蒂頭的利用　吸香烟時剩下的蒂頭，不要捨　，司積留在桶內，用水浸漬，因為蒂頭的尼哥丁，就會溶解水中，再用紗布濾出，這液灑在陰溝或垃圾桶內，可防害蟲發生，又以筆蘸這液，搽在植物的枝葉上，可滅油蟲，眞是廢物利用，一舉兩得。</p>
<p>赤足穿鞋時的注意　赤足穿鞋，應在鞋底先墊吸墨紙，紙上再襯薄布，那末，足汗為吸墨紙吸去，而且可保足蹠清潔，如腳蹠多膚屑，最客易汚鞋襪，應在洗足後用竹片刮去，新買的襪，因為有漿糊，先用溫水搓洗，然後可穿。</p>
<p>便所的奧氣消毒　除便所的臭氣，大抵用硫酸銅，過錳鉀酸加星，等藥，他如甘蒲拉油，阿爾菩司，阿里司台心等，都有殺菌的效力，若在大便所內散樟腦丸小便器中放那夫太林丸，都可避穢除臭，比市上所售的臭藥水還要有效。</p>
<p>金屬器具上寫字法　要想寫字繪畫在金屬製的器具上，先在面上塗蠟，用針雕刻，那蠟為針刻去留孔，再用硫酸或鹽酸，注在刻去的孔中，停放數小時，再用水洗去酸質後，把蠟刮去，那末寫字繪畫部分，都為酸性所腐蝕了。</p>
<p>防鏡與玻璃生曇　氣候寒時，室內的鏡面玻璃，因觸了水蒸氣，就要起曇，預防的方法如下：一，用乾的烟草摩擦，二，克里舍林一半，淸水一半混和，用布搽擦鏡面，三，加百分之十克里舍林於木精中，先用布塗擦，再用乾布揩净，都有效騐的。</p>
<p>更正　九月二十三日春秋，所刊「識字運動」一文，乃鄙人所作，原稿有王莎葩署名，今不知何以植顏波光君？關於文章酬資等尙係小事，惟中有涉及內子蘭心小女嫣紅等，頗有出入，至希查明校正，為感。干莎葩</p>

<p>鄭標遠月獨漲</p>
<p>鄭標花前市開盤、趨勢俏利、美棉上升、而上日人心多數看漲、得此良好消息一助、市象愈緊、近月漲力尤足、但拍至遠月、多頭吐出略鬆、結果各月比上日收盤價又漲五分至三角、午後開盤、市狀仍聚昂、然買者未見十分踴躍、後以大阪三品棉花平平、檯面尤鬆、結果各月比上午收盤價回跌一角至一角半、查賣出明德一千五百擔、泰興九百擔、瑞大二干一百擔、森康一千七百擔、長餘一千四百擔、泰昌一千六百擔、恊成九百擔、信誠一千擔、長和一千八百擔、生源一千二百擔、益豐一千三百擔、買進大孚二千八百擔、大豐二千三百擔，振大一千三百擔、同興一千三百擔、長豐一千七百擔、源興昌五千三百擔、瑞源一千一百擔、瑞大一千四百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>麥昨日期麥市面、上午開盤、初漲機跌、開價時因洋麥繼續高漲、致大部分人心、異常堅佾、本月份開至一角七分、十一月份至一角九分、均為最高紀錄、過此之後、因粉市漲而反跌、獲利多暢、亦出籠甚暢、故市氣即轉軟弱、迨至下午開盤、近期因現麥仍俏人心尙定、遠期則套戶頗盛、又見軟落、惟以近况而言、恐屬大張小同耳、現麥市面、仍見平穩、由東麥開四元、漢口麥開三元八角半、計二千包、市阜豐辦去云、福新去山東麥一千五百包、價四元一角、比前開漲報一角、市上謠傅日商拋出四號坎麥一船、價祇五元四角一</p>

<h3>吃茶文學論補略</h3>
<p>— 唐弢</p>
<p>阿英先生在他的夜航集里，有一篇專談吃茶的文章，呌做『吃茶文學論』，他指出吃茶是山人名士們的雅事，也是他們的特權，並且說明所謂『寄沈痛於苦茶』的無聊，旁證博引，是一篇以古鑑今的好文章。</p>
<p>因為這問題很有趣，我也想來談談。為什麽呌做補呢？那是說，我想談一點阿英先生所不曾詳談——或者竟是他所鄙棄的滓渣。</p>
<p>首先還是講吃茶。粗人們在工作之後，也會口渴？想喝茶，這是的確的，但他們只知道喝，却不曾想到還可以吃。用蓋碗，用紫沙茶壺，淺斟細嚼，講究味，講究香，甚而至於講究色，這都是雅人們的特權，粗漢是沒法分潤的。所以吃茶也成文學，而且是雅的文學。</p>
<p>茶葉的被採作飲料，相傳是在唐朝，但也有說是晋朝的，茶錄云：「茶，古不聞食，晋以降，吳人採葉煮之，號茗粥。」不過吃茶而有文學，却無論如何是在唐朝，陸羽（鴻漸）的茶經和盧同（王川子）的茶歌外，白樂天，劉禹錫輩也都有詩文記詠。然而這些文章，一到宋朝，因為吃茶文學的進步，就頗為宋人所看不起了，袁質甫（文）就說：</p>
<p>劉夢得茶詩云：『自傍芳叢摘　　，斯須炒成滿窒香』以此知唐人未善啜茶也，使其見本朝蔡君謨丁謂之製作之妙，如此，則是詩當不作矣。夫旋摘之茶必香，其香當倍於常茶，非龍麝之比也。古人入茶有用龍麝者，其壞茶為不少；茶有自然之香，其何假於龍麝乎！黃太史詩云：『要及新香碾一杯，不應傳寳到雲來。』是知茶之新者，其香尤可愛也。又評白樂天的茶詩說：</p>
<p>白藥天茶詩云：「　嘗一　綠昌明」，昌明乃地名，在綿州，人便謂昌明茶綠，非也！此正與「黃金碾畔綠塵飛」之句相似。蓋是時未知所以造茶，制作不精，故茶之色猶綠。而好事者錄其茶之妙，亦未以白色為貴，其詩故如此。使樂天見今日之茶之美，而肯為是語耶！</p>
<p>質甫所說的蔡君謨丁謂（公言），就是宋朝兩個有名的吃茶文學家，蘇東坡詩云：『武夷溪邊粟粒芽，前丁後蔡和籠加。』也說的是這兩個。丁公言著有茶圖，蔡君謨著有茶錄。</p>
<p>明朝的吃茶文學，阿英先生在「吃茶文學論」里，說得頂詳細，道里不再贅了。不過自從王孟端過無錫，遊惠山，進聽松庵，造了一只竹爐以後，凡遊惠泉的人，大家都得做幾首詩，有淸一代，計有李東陽輩數十家。這些詩篇，都收在光緒年間翻印的明刊製茶新譜的後面。</p>
<p>吃茶的方法到了淸朝，益發精進了，但那文學，却並不比前人好。譬如刊在製茶新譜里的吧，我個人以為淸朝諸作遠不及淸以前的好。例如詠雙井茶云：</p>
<p>人間風日不到處，太上玉堂森寳書。想見東坡舊居士，揮毫百斛瀉明珠。我家江南摘雲腴，落　紛紛雪不如。為君喚起黃州夢，歸載扁舟向五湖。</p>
<p>這意識，雖然仍舊是講究吃茶文學者傳統的舊意識，並沒有什麽創見，然而倘論文字，却實在比刻意雕琢者好得多了。又如盧仝的茶歌未段云：</p>
<p>……玉川子，乘此淸風欲歸去，山上羣仙司下土，地位淸高隔風雨，安得知百萬億蒼生，命隨顚崖受辛苦。更從諫譏問蒼生，到頭合得蘇息否？</p>
<p>專在助詩興，益文思上兜圈子的大作，能說是比這好麼？吃茶不忘採茶人，這眞是吃茶文學里的別支。</p>
<p>現在的苦茶派，和這別支是沒茶關係的，因為他們還要幽閑，風雅，是道地的正統。記得封氏聞見記里載茶祖師陸鴻漸的事道：</p>
<p>李季卿宣慰江南，時茶飲初盛行。陸羽來見，旣坐，手自烹茶，口通茶名，區分指點。李公心鄙之。茶罷，命奴子取錢三十文酬茶博士。</p>
<p>這雖然好像煞風景，但以之對待那些專講雅道的茶子茶孫，却還是痛快的。</p>
<h3>太平天國的小說</h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>『太平天國三字經』而外，在這部孤抄本里，要以關於太平天國的一篇小說為最重要。世人都談太平天國的詩文，顯有及於小說的，自然是因為材料散佚的關係。太平天國是有自己的小說的，他們小說的內容形式何如呢？從這裏的一篇是很可得到一些暗示。其基礎仍然是建築在宗敎上，把一切「人間的事實都「神化」起來。此小說題「起事來歷眞傳」，附刊「太平天國三年新刻」八字。秀全之「全」字均作「泉」，避天王諱也。作者姓曾，名不詳，在太平天國中，此小說應佔頗重要的位置。其內容是寫太平天國起事的歷史，並說明起事的意義。全文不及二千字，特再介紹於讀者，亦可寳貴之初見的太平天國文化史料也。</p>

<p>曾氏曰：孟子言，五百年必有王者興。由洪武以來至於今，五百有餘歲，王者之興，此其時矣。順治三年，太昌後裔朱氏卜居於果化之柳樹灣，抵今僅十數家耳。灣西有揷香嶺。道光元年，河南林靑先生，於嶺側搆茅屋一間寓焉。因自號插霄散人，能望氣，歡休咎，無不奇中。嘗語人日：「朱灣瑞氣冲天，後必大貴。」至六年四月十八日，朱范氏夜夢神人騎黃龍過柳樹灣，前有二童子為導，驚寤腹痛，誕生一子。是夜西方紅光射天，遐邇皆見，都莫測其由來。予曾氏居老鴉坂，隔柳樹灣三里，年四十有七，是夜妻亦坐產，一舉兩男。越三日，予聞范氏夢，奇之，往扣　霄先生。先生隱而不言，再三詢之，囑莫漏天機；密語予曰：「騎黃龍過柳樹灣者，耶穌降生也。二童子者，雲曇雲梵降生也。去邪反正，其在魚鼈居山之後焉」。論六年，朱姓邀予二子同從學於揷霄先生。先生文譜孔孟，武曉孫吳，口則經史諄諄，夜則敎習兵法。諸生辛　悟過人，十年以來，學術成就。或問先生日：「凡學成者名必就，諸生大成矣，而不務功名何為」？先生笑而不答。二十一年九月九日，先生邀予登嶺巓，坐磐石仰觀天象，指示星宿部位曰：「若者當興，若者當廢」，二听自。又指曰：「西北黑氣彌天，魚鼈將居山矣」。勸予移居。予戀故鄉，英之移也。十一月甲子日，先生散館，夜焚茅廬而去，竟不知其所往。次年果大水，山原並沒。如是者八年，朝廷無恤災之政，邑郡有抗稅之刑。民之流亡死絕者，　可勝道。中鄉長樂村洪錫恩，善人也，所生二子，長子秀泉素諳韜略，曾舉文孝廉。次子秀鎭，智勇兼備，曾舉武孝廉。其家富埒陶自，貲邁程羅。值此大災，慷慨施予，邑之扶老携幼，踵洪門而求濟者，不計其數。予偕朱生率二子往謁之，與語竟日，歡如舊相識，留欵於馥園之尙志堂。遽邑宰溫克堯，因借金不允，惡錫，遂以要結人心見罪，拘錫入禁，兵解藩司。通邑不服，截路殺官兵數十。文武飛報，紛紛點兵，合縣抄拘。錫泣曰：「為吾一家，貽害通邑，吾大不忍，速縛吾父子，解送府尊，以救通邑性命。」朱生曰：「不然，事已如此，猶作兒女態，無益也。昔吾師林靑先生，設帳於揷霄嶺時，曰：魚鼈居山，黎民悽絕。九里事前，束牲歃血。果化之西，洪鬥之北。英雄如雲，盟書共結。今騐矣。吾聞廣省有萬頂山，長亘百餘里，甚險峻，豪傑廣聚，擁立四王。東王楊君甫，西王蕭集成，南王錢紹堯，北王何有動，俱有經天緯地之才。帳下勇敢之夫，約有萬餘。予友京谿郭萬年，嘗與四王通往來，請以此事往吿，必諧。予與秀兄等，價結通邑宿儒義士，掃除貪官汚吏，抄盡果化籍量，俟英雄齊集，雄踞廣西。相時度勢，陳兵積栗，跨兩粵，馳三楚。控九江而直下，分五隊以長驅。諒江南之人，聞風震駭，智不乃謀，勇不及斷，欲取金陵，若振枯葉。自後藉金陵為根本，順利撫之，逆則征之，不出十年，天下定矣。何必守小信小節，自蹈危亡，以中狐　狗黨之欲哉？」錫乃歡曰：「朱生之言是也。今日破家亡軀山爾等，化家為國亦山爾等。」於是各募勇遐邇，不句口間，巳逾萬人。九里亭前，歃血共盟。衆推錫為盟主。錫曰：「吾老矣！有朱生在；嗣貪官汚吏俱已殺盡，郭招萬頂由英雄齊集，又相與歃血洪門，仍批錫為盟主。錫又曰：「有朱生在！」諸王亦無不心悅誠服。此二十九年三月事也。予憶林靑　霄光生之言，實先生之先見，至今有歷歷不爽者。顧先生何在，而不與是盟，吾甚惜之。吾欲大先生之名，　　為之誌云。</p>
<p>此文作者對於文學頗有素養。如所記，捨神話部分，皆係　實事情，則於吾人過去已知想事事實，將有許多改變。而尤共值得注意的，是作者竭力推崇「朱生，」於秀全殊少說話。山字里行間窺之，似頗為「朱生」不平者。則初期太平天國內部之矛盾，其消息可於此中見之矣。然　此「朱生」者果為　乎？所云「　　　先先之　，」大體　來，「烟　彈」而已。</p>
<h3>鄕誼（下）</h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>我這同鄉很善於說話。他還帶有一副嗬囒牌，並目賭得很精。但是對於　我感不到什麽興趣。「那麽我們就談點什麽吧」，他把牌推到他的網籃邊去了。</p>
<p>「老弟」，他開始這樣呌我了。「你的年紀還輕，什麼都幼稚得很呀！比如賭嗬　脾，你是我的對手麽，有五百你就得輸五百，一個仙也留不了！你知道我是走遍了英嗬屬地，結交過大頭家，在華人公館里叉過兩百塊錢麻將的像伙呀」！他的眉毛揚起來，還用手摸摸下巴，那里長着粗黑的鬍髭。</p>
<p>我沒有出聲，讓他說下去：「你離開××多少年了？我十九歲就出門的，一直到去年的冬天才回去過。××巳經不像從前了：馬路，汽車，電影戲院，還有娼妓——你猜她們怎麽的？自然比巴達維亞或者新加坡的番婆好得事囉，乾乾凈凈的，至少不會使你生楊梅瘡……，你怎麽的，老弟？你就像一個不曾貼過女人的肉的毛爾小子似地帶着優氣呀」！</p>
<p>我感到在這個老於世故的人面前的不安了。他說着根五素來沒和我說起過的話，雖然根五的年紀也許比他還要老成。他似乎非常富於機智，當他發現我對於女人的事不感到興趣的時候，話頭立刻就改變了：</p>
<p>「我還忘記問你呢，你到棉蘭去做什麽事？」</p>
<p>「我嗎？人家介紹我到那里的商會去担任一個小小的職務。」</p>
<p>「那很好，老弟，小小的職務——年輕人，難道一出茅廬就能做秘書，當主席麽？而且你知不知道現在的時勢，談到他們說的：不景氣！失業的人多得很呀，你算是很幸運的一個」！他斜靠着半舊的皮箱，說完了話，有的時候凝睇在我身上；如果他笑起來，我就看得見那變成黑色的牙齒。</p>
<p>旅途上有了還喜歡說話的。當有人生經騐的同鄕，的確是打破了獨身者的寂寞的。可是對於這個人我始終弄不明白他到底是怎麼一種人。幾次我用話來問他，都給很巧妙地吱唔過去了。有一次他竟那樣說了。</p>
<p>「老弟，你擔心什麼！像你這樣老實可靠的人，我總得提拔一下你才對。你到棉蘭以後等着吧，我會給你一個不小的職務的。」</p>
<p>可是我看見的他是並不闊氣的大艙客，跟我一樣，只有兩件行李上穿在他身上的襯衫似乎好久不曾掉換了，領背上全是汁漬。他吸廉價的香烟；甚至於有一次我和他一同行過買香烟的地方，他問我有沒有兩包象標烟的錢。</p>
<p>「我的零碎錢不曉得什麼時候化掉了，給了我吧，老弟，要講講同鄕的情誼啊。」</p>
<p>用着鄕誼這好聽的名詞，這個自稱老大的人從我乾澀的袋子里拿去了他的香間錢。一面吸着烟，他一面對我說：</p>
<p>「看在鄉誼上，我一定好好地照顧你的。明天一早船要進不老灣了，從那里上了岸，你就可以坐車到棉蘭去了。」</p>
<p>這樣，他就要我的行李拚到他那里去，一齊岸。當我把那隻皮箱交給他的時候，他的手不住地在那上面摸着，而且呌道：</p>
<p>「好貨色呀！抵得十塊錢的　貨色呀！」</p>
<p>船在不老灣停下來，我按照着殖民政府的上岸手續到移民廳去傳話。那個同鄉和行李到外邊去等我，因為他是老客，只把居留紙呈騐一下就完了事。那個移民廳長一面用那對深籃的眼睛盯在我的臉上，一面搜尋着話來盤問我。這樣足足給纏了半個多鐘頭，像釋放一個囚犯似地，我被放了出來。外邊停着許多汽車，馬車和走動着雜査的人。我找尋着那個同鄉，然而連影子也沒有了！</p>
<p>在給根五的信上，我寫道。</p>
<p>「根五：人是安穩地到了這里，行李却沒有了。那不是終於我不到熟人的緣故，我在船上遇見了一個極重鄉誼的××人。可是這個同鄉現在連我的行李一同失踪了……」（完）</p>
<h3>都市的夜景</h3>
<p>— 童晴嵐</p>
<p>這無邊的夜風</p>
<p>搖動着人力車前的銅鈴，</p>
<p>夾雜在摩托卡的汽笛里，</p>
<p>尖銳地響破這街心；</p>
<p>給壓榨出來的汗水，</p>
<p>拌和着脚下的灰塵，</p>
<p>光滑滑的地板上，</p>
<p>韋士忌雜亂地交流；</p>
<p>枯瘦的手</p>
<p>拉動車輪邁進，</p>
<p>肥軟的臂</p>
<p>拖着白嫩的肉打滾；</p>
<p>沙土填飽了餓腹，</p>
<p>道旁的泥溝</p>
<p>漂流着發酵的殘羹；</p>
<p>這死沉的人間</p>
<p>儘是黯澹的，</p>
<p>這夜景要繼續到天明。</p>

<h3>名譽老婆婆（一）</h3>
<p>— 江馬修作任鉤譯</p>
<p>近來只是想看卓別麟的「Kid」，於是我們就跑進郊外的一間影戲院裏去。可是，那逗人悅樂的「Kid」已經映過了一半，馬上就完結了。接着就開映那部有名的軍事宜傳片「吉岡大住」。我覺得十分掃興，打算馬上回去，但是，剛剛特意化了錢跑進來，就這樣地走出去，又不免覺得可惜。</p>
<p>『喂，怎麽樣？你想要再看下去嗎，』我問同去的妻。</p>
<p>『哎，』她躊躇着：『可是巳經特地跑來了，就再珊一部吧。許久沒有看日本電影了，偶然地看它一同也好。』</p>
<p>『可是，「吉岡大佐」……』</p>
<p>『這也沒有什麽關係。所謂軍事宣傳片究竟是怎樣的東西，把它看來參考參考也不壞啦。』</p>
<p>『你的話也有道理。』</p>
<p>於是我就坐下來，繼續看那開始映在幕上的「吉岡大佐」。</p>
<p>我和妻在最近的好幾年當中都完全沒有看過日本電影。以往的失望，簡直不能够讓我們生起要看日本電影的心情。可是，現在，當我們看着「吉岡大佐」的當兒，首先，却感到佩服，覺得日本電影也十分進步了。情節的發展很日然，沒有誇張。各個塲面的挑選和攝影的方法也很巧妙。演員也熱心而巧妙地表演着。在各個地方所表現出來的幽默也頗為有着效果，非常投合觀衆的脾胃。尤其是，在片子裏所表現出來的，都是我們置身其中的日本生活，一切都非常親切，可以深刻地感受得到。就是同樣使人發笑的表演，也並不和看卓別麟的電影一樣，覺得是些跟我們離開得多遠的東西；反之，却能够使人活生生地感到那實在是跟我們很親近，很吻合的情景。影片慢慢地映下去，充滿在戲院裏的羣衆也漸漸地熱烈起來了。老實說，就是我們，也終於相當熱心地看起來了。</p>

<h3>犯罪的增加</h3>
<p>— 熊誠</p>
<p>前見報載：「據公共租界工部局警務處八月份報吿：是月犯罪案之經報吿者，共一四二二件，較之七月份，增加二十九伴，而較之去年同月，亦增加三十四件；是月所逮捕之罪犯，亦較前數凡增加，計共一三七四人……若以犯罪之種類分別言之，八月份發生謀殺案一件，殺人未遂案一件，是月盜刦案共十九起，普通盜案十六起，家宅竊案三十七起……」</p>
<p>中國的上海，上海的公共租界（法租界及華界除外），在八月份內「經報吿」之犯罪案卽有一四二二件，所逮捕之罪犯卽有一三七四人。比之去年同月及本年的上一個月，都有增加。這，眞是「足以驚人」的了。</p>
<p>若以全上海，十二個月內，述未「經報吿」者來計算，將是一個怎樣龐大的數字，若以全中國來說，又將是一個怎樣龐大的數字！</p>
<p>無疑的，犯罪案件數字的龐大，完全的反映出現在中國社會的不景氣已深化到什麽程度了。同時，從「較之去年同月，增加三十四件……較之七月份，增加二十九件」。可以看出不景氣是在急激的加深哩！</p>
<p>然而這種現象的原因在什麽呢？很明顯的，這决不是什麽「人心不古，世風日下，而是普遍的「生活日下」。窮的人，是更窮了；往日「還可以過過」的人，也全數窮下來。在農村念激破產，經濟加速崩潰的情勢下，淸理，關店，失業，形成了普遍的貧窮。一般人，爲了「求生乏術」，乃不得不另尋出路而「走入邪途」。終於「犯罪」了，「擾亂治安」了。</p>
<p>所以，這種增加狀態，絕不是簡單地增厚警力所能抑止的罷。換句話說，如果不從改善人民的生活這根本問題着想。則非但絕對不會使這種現象消滅，而且相反的，只有增加。那末我們將從何處着手，以改善一般人的生活問題呢？現在世界上，沒有失業，絕少犯罪的「桃源」，試問將何途之從而出。</p>
<h3>古城小憶</h3>
<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>有一年，我曾在一個古城裏盤桓。現在在這裏讓我寫一點點回憶吧。</p>
<p>這古城，所以對我是並不隔閡的，風情俗習和愚樸的民性，我也都知道和明悉一點的；古城的風光，也是別有情趣。倘使你要我說那些古城相傳的沿革，我也可以吿訴你。可是這，也早巳有人拿去做史和札記的資料了，而且我也寫不盡那古城的傳說，和一篇一篇的史考及掌故。在這裏，讓我先叙述一點點古城的景色吧。</p>
<p>在城頭上，看不見一朶紫色野花的點綴，或是一莖孤零零地生長的狗尾草和蒲公英也沒有；往日在城頭上也有着一二個灰色的大兵，在秋日的陽光裏打着瞌睡，槍頭朝着天，膝頭碰着膝頭，軍帽壓得低低的，連嘴吧也瞧不到在那裏。有趣的野孩子們，在膝頭間挿上一根細竹枝，乾枯的葉子在秋風裏蕭蕭地響着；也有或是打背上畫着一個大烏龜，遠遠看去似乎在背上慢慢地爬。寂寞時，在小樓憑欄望着，會心的微笑，時時展上口角和眉梢，可以解一解悶兒吧。而這寂寞如畫的景色，益增了古城的灰色的古老呵！</p>
<p>其次，是那鼓樓，在古城裏雖是特徵，可是也並非創見呢。而這鼓樓和別的一樣不値得去考査底細，難道可以說得分曉這鼓樓曾有多少歲月？而那似神話的傳說，難以令人確信，然而在古城裏有着鼓樓，那終是這古老的本色，我們可不言而知了。而鼓樓，給異地顚沛流連的流浪子，有着一點點安慰，也有着傷懷的感慨吧。倘在深夜牀上擁衾孤眠時，貼着壁傾聽着小胡同里打更的人，一步一咳嗽地，巳摸準了那一塊石塊髙和那一塊石頭低的，敲打着竹梆走着，在樓底下停了下來，照例他是在這里預備偸偸地睡一下。這時，我可以想到一盞小口的燈籠，靜靜地放在竹梆旁邊，照亮了一小方的地面，和年老打更者渴睡的嘴臉。</p>
<p>在這當兒，鼓樓上的大鐘正一下一下敲打若，我可以輕輕地細數着：一，二，三，……想着，在這一個沒有大月亮的夜里，那里又遭着火災了，在火光里面將葬沒了幾個生命哪？也不知敲穿了幾許　客的心呢；這不是幸災樂禍的心理，而我，也覺得夜正長，無邊的…………</p>
<p>難道眞個是幸災樂禍？然而這，也可以令人驀然相思，安慰着獨客寂寞的心震，在這個夜里，可以做着古城的夢，荒誔，神奇而有趣，在夢中自己幾乎是不可一世，可以忘去了客中的辛勞，心中從此蘊着一種盲目對於時代雄心的企圖，這，鼓樓是給於人的溫馨。</p>
<p>此外，灰沙也是古城的特徵。在一個發大風天，天空路上，屋頂滿是灰沙在迷離地飛揚：在這天傍晚時放工趕路回家，巳瞧不到對面的人。路上只是一片可咚可咚的洋車夫的鈴聲，似乎在耳邊響着，回頭可以在灰沙糢糊里微微發紅的燈寵在路中穿梭着。在大風里也不能張大了嘴吧講話，一開口灰沙朝嘴里鑽，滿口都是，只能閉緊了嘴，俯下頭走着，脚步也加快地趕回家，滿面撲上一層厚厚的灰土，只剩得一雙烏眼子和一張嘴吧，可以看見在轉動。徜使用</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>手指翹一翹鼻孔，早已給灰土塡滿了，這麽着，我只有苦笑了。</p>
<p>可是在滂沱的雨天裏，只可以赤脚打泥濘的路上跑，而且時時要提防跌入街頭空巷的小小的泥沿里。</p>
<p>在古城，只有上面這幾種景色，可以給我悠久的回憶吧。</p>
<h3>夜之歌</h3>
<p>— 辛爾</p>
<p>（一）夢</p>
<p>移居到半鄉村的江灣來，想把生活刷新一下，希望在靜美幽秀的鄉村之旁，把煩亂，把纏不淸得如在惡夢中的心情理工理。且也許可以淸凈心靈，寫點文章。然而鄉下，靜是靜了，却如舊的老是彷彿若有所失；不安，煩惱在寂寞的黑屋內，更紛紛的飛閃着那陰影！</p>
<p>幾年來使我最顫抖，最難堪的是：整夜，一闔上眼皮，便落在夢中，開始是使人多添許多不安的懷感，但漸漸的，只是風吹灰塵似的，一片亂夢。醒來，只是頭昏腦脹，想起在揚鞭張爪的生活，只是茫然，只是如迷途的小孩，迷糊莫辨。追憶起過去那甜夢醒來的淸定的情神，流淚了。將怎樣掙扎呢？許多人敎我要靜，要少用腦，服藥，不可過度興奮或悲傷；然而，這些都和我隔離得十分遼遠。這些都是另種人的好朋友。我，只有老遠在生活的鐵蹄下呻吟。</p>
<p>前面是遙遠的旅程！我這樣像殘廢的旅人，將如何度過呢！這負傷的旅人！</p>
<p>（二）失眠</p>
<p>然而，夢只有加重，已經整整一年了，我絲毫想不起夢境的容姿……張開眼睛，縱使追憶了半天，只是支持不住昏脹的頭而倒下去。呵，我沒有夢醒的時侯了麽！緊緊跟着來的，幻滅，逃避現實的幻想，便輕輕泛上。於是，白天，幻想和夢便也結成黑漆一團。於是，失眠，在吮吸將枯的血！</p>
<p>黑沉沉的夜，狹小雜亂的小房子裏。遠遠的狗兒在叫，夜風偕着聲音，傳進死寂的窗內：生與死的交戰之音呵—我微顫的這樣意識着。便制不住恐怖的哀號着極力的想一想吧！將怎樣震起走向滅亡的生命！然而，疲倦，迷亂，渾身繞着惱恨的火氣，輾轉，喘息，張開眼皮來，面前飛閃着無數的黑點，索性把電燈扭開，沉寂，荒凉，凄淡，又只能頽然，依舊把電燈熄了。閉上眼，制正更煩亂得如浪濤冲濺的思緒。悔恨不該，不默默的讓她過去。</p>
<p>「過去，可是又過不去！」又是一陣如焚的痛苦。</p>
<p>生命是如烟，値不得幾個錢，像一場亂夢！然而，生命終竟是要活下去，而生命之前，是一片無垠的大海！失眠，咀嚼着我，我只有像垂斃的虫。……</p>
<p>（三）夜之歌</p>
<p>只有在極度疲倦的時候，迷亂的髙潮，正從尖端轉身的時候，得到了半絲的靜息。而夜之歌，從半掩半開的窗扉漏進來，才使我有點釋然凝聽。</p>
<p>聽，這江灣夜半的歌音！那雖然是極平常的。</p>
<p>常常是馬蹄擊着水門汀的有節奏的聲音，咯咯咯，比蛙聲沉而有力，那是此沙漠裏的遠行的駝兒的濁重的脚步音，加倍觸着坐待前行的旅人的心，而使我好像微微的淸醒着。由高而低而遠，而隱約，消逝得那麽幽美可憶；但正當我在尋獲那似乎留下無限餘味的尾音，後面又湧上那更新鮮有力的咯咯的脚音，隱隱有如將上戰塲的戰馬在跳躍的音容。使我猛省而又沉定的張開眼睛來。</p>
<p>呵，我吐了口甜息的呼吸！原來窗扉的斜月淡美幽淸，心神一新，行近窗邊，辨別出了！這是馬夫放馬的時候嗎？那是馬脚的前行！黑夜巳經將完了！我正驚疑不定，遠遠又傳來豪壯的歌音，迅速的，如在窗下催人。斷斷續續，盡是挑着重祖子將進市去的鄕下人，那堅苦，壯健，而生氣躍然的勞動曲，深深浸進我空虛的心。</p>
<h3>笑</h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>—A　laugh　a　day，Keeps　the　doctoraway．（「一天笑一回，請醫生滾蛋。」）</p>
<p>一位美國富商型的老先生，用了紳士式的有禮貌的不徐不疾的音調，把手輕輕地拍着我底肩膀，極力做得十二分的誠懇與關心的樣子對我說：</p>
<p>「喝，孩子，年紀靑靑的，正是起勁的年紀哩，幹麽儘是那樣的陰沈着臉，哭喪着臉呀！外國人說的：「一天笑一回，請醫生滾蛋」：所以外國人都是精精神神的，全能辦大事業啊：年靑人應當常常笑笑—我自己在年靑的時候就常常有明朗的笑的。是的，年靑人應　常常笑應當使自己快活起來，應當精精神神地……」</p>
<p>有那麽多的「應當」！我從他底一種特殊的神情中，看見了藏在他底起了　紋的臉下的，遮在他底英國紳士式的朝服下面的一種卑鄙的僞誠！這，與其說是一個老年人對少年人的生活上的鼓勵，還不如說一隻殘酷的食肉獸在暴力與不道德的勝利中來卑汚地嘈弄一隻失敗的小綿羊妥當得多！於是，爲了報答一位紳士的過份的「好意」，我畢竟笑了！我把牙齒全部露了出來，張開嘴，抖動嘴唇，像痙擊一樣地。</p>
<p>「天，你這孩子！你笑得那麽可怕啊！」</p>
<p>「是的，先生，我是不熟悉於笑的。」</p>
<p>「你在孩子的時候，你看見母親的可愛的臉，你看見天上的星星，你不常笑的嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，先生，在孩子時代，我看見母親被父親死命地打到半死，我看見冬天不停地吹着風，飄着雨雪，我是時常哭的！哭得像……」</p>
<p>「天哪！這是什麼話？這是什麽話？這……」</p>
<p>「這是什麽話？」眞是見他媽的鬼哪！拖着一個二十五歲的身子（是「可愛的年靑代」啊！）拖着一個沈重得像垃圾堆一樣的「性命」，天天在人的下面，給生活鎭壓得連氣也透不過來了！疲乏得像一條病了的野狗一樣，還笑？</p>
<p>「笑』這一個名詞（也許人世間眞的是有那樣一件東西的吧？也許是沒有的吧？）曾幾時在我的生命史中存在過呢？過去的是不敢追憶，未來的也不敢推想了。一天天像機械那麽的帶着摩擦的怪聲生活下去，就一天天地活在世上。</p>
<p>在夢裏，在不常有的瞑想中，我時常那麽想：也許在孩子的時候是有過另外一種的笑的吧？然而這應當是那麽樣的一種呢？而現今，長大了，被投向生活的孤獨無援的油鍋裏去，而那些笑，也像遇到了頂猛烈的炸彈似的，被炸得粉碎，被體無完膚地毁壞，消失了。</p>
<p>消失了！那是永遠追不回來的；那是永遠彌補不好的生活的創痕啊！有那麽多的人，在苦難中告訴我許多「應當」的事情，譬如說：年靑人「應當」快活而精精神神的，「應當」笑！</p>
<p>然而，生活所能允許給你選擇的，祇有「是」與「不是」，而不是「應當」與「不應當」啊。譬如說：流浪，飢餓，困苦，疲乏……那一大串不祥的字眼，雖道也能拿「應當」與「不應當」來解說的嗎？</p>
<p>「笑吧，」我時常對自己說，「正是年靑的時候哩，年靑的人是要常常笑的啊！」</p>
<p>然而，結果我祗能可怕地露一露牙齒，打抖，痙擊吧啦；我明白了：在不算輕的生活的鎭壓中，我是始終拙於笑的；而笑，也不肯爬上我底低賤的臉上來的。</p>
<p>有誰曾見過，南方的太陽會照在北國的冰天雪地中的呢？</p>

<h3>銀濤</h3>
<p>— 艾荼</p>
<p>我愛那狂濤之濱的澳門，並不是因為他是東方的蒙特卡羅——一個繁雜的大賭塲。而受着那東半球和西半球混合的一種新鮮而美麗的風度。不錯：我在什麽時侯都是這樣的懷戀着她，正好像懷戀着一朵未放的蓓蕾似的。</p>
<p>當我這一次南歸的時候，又少不得到澳門的海濱去流浪了。</p>
<p>晚上，火船從廣州駛到澳門的港口的時候，我們可以從艙里眺望出去，那廣闊的海面不停地飄着的浪花，好像銀樣的在飄呀飄的，同時，我聽到那慣常的狂暴的濤聲，跟着海風在揚盪着。孤濱岸上的山峯，吊滿了迷人的色彩的燈光。這兒就跟香港不同樣，比較沉默點見的，正好像一個閨秀的少女一樣。</p>
<p>到了澳門，踏上了那用石子砌成的碼頭的路上的時候，照例地看到許多穿得花枝似的女兒們站在上面等侯她們的朋友上來的。東方的蒙特卡羅的女兒是浪漫的，雖然那復古的禮敎思想又强化地在南國盛行着，但是，你們看呀！她們那麽親熱而可愛的地在跳躍似的笑着呢，正好像夜里的銀濤是高觀的，響着雄亮的調子，跟着海風的旋律而飄揚，加上了高大的旅店里透出來的女人的歌聲，就構成了一個新的音樂的圈子了。</p>
<p>跟朋友們在繁盛的街道上流盪了一個晚上，又進了那唯一的華麗的跳舞塲，瞧着南國的人們的狂熱的風度，迷人的。到了深夜，我們又開始在遼遠的淸潔而沉靜的海濱，是用士敏士構成的西灣馬路上流浪。</p>
<p>不錯，我總不會間斷的，在澳門，無論那一天的深夜，當人家正在沉醉在火熱的圈子里的時候。我們幾個同是年輕的不安於家的流浪人又開始在詩的境界里沉默地去尋求人生活所剩餘下來的一點滋味。天天都是這樣地，然而究竟得到什麽生活的解答呢？依然是一樣淡漠的呀！這，我自己的心里又常常這種矛盾的咒咀着。可是，算了吧！我是這樣飄盪的人呀！我不能怪自己，正好像那美麗的銀濤不能永遠的常常地好像夜里一樣媚人的吧。</p>
<p>在平坦而淸楚的海濱上流浪着，淡黃色的街燈從叢密的葱鬱的常綠樹的葉此問透下來的影子，幌盪個不停的。在陰暗的圈子里，我們總是常常地看到一雙一雙的男女的影子那麽親密地在輕盪着。——不錯，西灣的夜里是戀愛的聖地哪！然而，我們不管，也不多偷看一下的，正好像那穿着黃色的制服在街頭守夜的印度阿三們一樣，完不多望一下的就溜開去了。而我們的目的是在海濱上來看美麗的銀濤呀！</p>
<p>銀濤在廣闊的海面展開着。我們的眼珠子跟着一朵一朵的濤花而移動着，不錯，我們可以相信那是白銀溶化了下來的影子吧！然而，當從海面滾上陸地來的銀濤的時候，沙沙的響過了一會兒，我們可看不到一點兒影子了，只是地面是那麽濕潤的，好像大雨後的樣子的。</p>
<p>海面飄來的風多淸凉的呀！我們腿兒有點兒酸的時候，澳門已歸於沉靜的睡鄕了。這時，我們只得又沉默地回歸去，一個流浪人的簡單的家里了。</p>

<h3>Xi'an Establishes Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters; National Government Appoints Chiang Kai-shek as Commander-in-Chief; Chiang Plans to Visit Once Organization is Complete</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) On the 2nd, the National Government issued an order specially appointing Chiang Kai-shek concurrently as the Commander-in-Chief of the Northwest Bandit Suppression, and Zhang Xueliang as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. (2nd dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a certain source, the military authorities are planning to unify the command of the bandit suppression forces in Shaanxi Province and to achieve rapid and effective elimination. It has been decided to establish a Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Xi'an, with Chiang as the Commander-in-Chief and Zhang Xueliang as the Deputy Commander. When the headquarters is established, Chiang will personally visit Xi'an, and Zhang will be in charge thereafter. In addition, matters concerning logistics are being planned. The Shaanxi bandits have now gathered in the border area of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Sichuan. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) To thoroughly eliminate the bandit scourge in the Northwest, the military authorities plan to establish a Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters in Xi'an. Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman of the Military Council, will concurrently serve as the Commander-in-Chief. Due to the planning of bandit suppression military affairs in various areas, Chiang may not be able to stay in Xi'an for long, so Zhang Xueliang will serve as the Deputy Commander, and will be stationed in Xi'an permanently in the future to command everything. The logistics department of the headquarters has already begun preparations, and it can be announced as established after the official order is issued. It is said that Chiang plans to go to Xi'an after the organization is complete. The military strength in Shaanxi and Gansu is currently quite strong. After proper deployment, encirclement and suppression will begin immediately. It is said that the main force of the Communist bandits has now returned to the border area of Gansu, Sichuan, and Shaanxi. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhengzhou) It is often heard that the Sichuan bandits, who have been trapped in desolate areas by the National Army for a long time, are suffering from hunger and cold, stripping clothes from local residents to keep warm, and even resorting to eating infants to survive. Now, due to the difficulty of supplying provisions and being attacked by the National Army from all sides, they are attempting to create disturbances on the border of Gansu and Qinghai. Recently, banditry occurred in Min County in eastern Gansu. After Wang Jun's troops dealt them a heavy blow, the bandits suffered heavy casualties and fled in disarray. Currently, there are no traces of bandits within a hundred miles of Min County. Chiang Kai-shek, in order to facilitate bandit suppression command and thoroughly eliminate the bandit atmosphere in the Northwest, has decided to form a Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters, with Chiang himself as the Commander-in-Chief and Zhang Xueliang as the Deputy Commander, responsible for supervising the suppression. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Chengdu) Zhang Xueliang visited Chairman Chiang again on the 2nd to ask for instructions on the organization of the Northwest Bandit Suppression Headquarters. Xue Yue also visited Chiang at noon to ask for instructions on bandit suppression plans. At 7 PM in the evening, Chairman Chiang again invited Zhang, Xue, Gu Zhutong, Wu Chengren, and others to dinner at the headquarters. Chairman Chiang also met with Chengdu gentry Xu Zixiu and others at 11 AM on the 2nd. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Huang Musong Hosts Banquet for Wu Heling and Others to Discuss Resolution of Xigong Banner Dispute</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Huang Musong, Chairman of the Mongolian Committee, hosted a banquet on the 2nd for Mongolian Political Council members Ke Yu'e, Wu Heling, and others in Nanjing to discuss appropriate solutions to the Xigong Banner dispute and invited them to mediate. Huang also met with Wu Heling on the 2nd and asked Wu to convey the central government's intention to maintain local interests, hoping that both parties would make concessions to end the dispute. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wu Heling, representative of the Mongolian Political Council stationed in Nanjing, visited Huang Musong, Chairman of the Mongolian Committee, on the morning of the 2nd to report on the situation of the Xigong Banner dispute and requested that the central government be informed and seek mediation quickly. Wu and Yi Deqin are scheduled to go north on the 4th to attend the Mongolian Political Council meeting. Bai Yunti and Ke Xing'e were originally scheduled to go north, but due to the approaching Sixth Plenary Session, there are rumors that they will cancel their trip to Mongolia. The candidates for the central government's major officials to be sent for mediation have been decided and are currently being sought for opinions. Once the mediation method is determined, it can be brought along. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to Mongolian sources, the rumor that the Xigong Banner side has opened fire is not accurate. Everything is awaiting fair handling by the central government. Bai Yunti and Ke Xing'e, members of the Mongolian Political Council staying in Beijing, have decided to leave Beijing and go north tomorrow due to the central government's order to mediate. After contacting Mongolian princes and nobles here, they will go to Bailing Temple. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to the Office of Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs, Bai Yunti, Ke Xing'e, and Wu Heling will arrive in Beiping on the 5th and go to Bailing Temple with Bao Yueqing and others to attend the Third Congress of the Mongolian Political Council.

<p>(Nanjing) The central government previously decided on the principles for punishing tax evasion and handed them over to the Legislative Yuan to formulate separate laws and regulations. The Yuan meeting decided to hand them over to the Finance and Criminal Law Committees. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan sent a draft of the regulations on punishing tax evasion, which was also handed over to the two committees for joint review. As a result of the review, the two cases were merged into the Regulations on Punishing National Tax Evasion, with six principles formulated, which were presented to President Sun and forwarded to the Central Political Council for discussion. The Central Political Council has approved it on the morning of the 2nd and has sent it back to the Legislative Yuan for review. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

The investigation is quite detailed. Recently, he is staying in Beijing temporarily to organize the materials obtained from the investigation and conduct academic research.

He also has no comments on Leith-Ross's research on economics and finance in Shanghai and Minister Kong's talks. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Wan Gong Embankment Collapses; Yellow River Flows Directly into Shuyang County</h3>
<p>Tens of Days of Rescue Work Washed Away; Ministry of Water Resources Cables County Government to Quickly Gather Laborers for Rescue; Provincial Government Orders Commissioner Hao to Mediate Disputes in Three Counties</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Chai Mi Hebei embankment between Pingdun Village and Da Shi Village in Shuyang has collapsed for over thirty zhang. The Ministry of Water Resources cabled County Magistrate Deng Xianghai on the 1st, urging him to quickly gather laborers for rescue and dispatch strong laborers to guard the Chai Mi Hebei embankment day and night to avoid negligence. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) The water situation downstream of Liutang is overflowing, and cracks have appeared in the embankments along the river. The left embankment of the Wan Gong Tangshan suddenly collapsed for over ten zhang yesterday. The Yellow River flowed directly into Shuyang County. Tens of days of rescue work have been wasted. The disaster situation is getting worse. County Magistrate Deng Xianghai ordered the district chiefs to block ships and escort them to the disaster area to rescue refugees. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The water level here fluctuates, causing people to worry and rejoice alternately. The water dropped about five inches yesterday and the day before, but now it has returned to its original level. The water stored in the Qingjiang Sluice is still recorded as two zhang and five chi. As for Yaosu, it rose two inches today, with Yaocun at two hundred seventy-four inches and Su at two hundred eighteen inches. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) According to the Huai-Pi section, the slight water level rose twelve centimeters due to the northwest wind, with three six point eight six seven meters. Yao rose two inches, and Su water rose another four inches by the time of power generation, with two hundred twenty-two inches. Therefore, it is also rumored that the south embankment of the Liutang River in Maba, Lianshui, is overflowing. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) The Huaihai long-distance bus resumed its long-distance service from the 2nd. The method is that at each waterlogged location along the way, such as the north bank of Liutang and the east gate of Shucheng, another vehicle will be prepared to take over in order to ensure smooth traffic. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Donghai, Shuyang, and Guanyun counties have disagreements due to flood control and are attacking each other. The provincial government believes that at this critical moment, they should cooperate closely and has cabled Commissioner Hao of Donghai to preside over the handling. The counties are requesting the demolition of the Yaowan Water Barrier Dam, but the province believes that the dam does not obstruct the flow of water and there is no need to demolish it. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Shen Caiyi, the engineer dispatched by the Ministry of Water Resources to Liuyang to guide the rescue project, reported to the ministry by telegram, stating that County Magistrate Deng of Shuyi reported to the ministry that several thousand elm trees, several thousand dan of forest straw, more than two thousand sacks, and twelve thousand rush mats, and ten thousand dan of lead wire were used for the rescue project, which is not true. He also said that ten thousand dan of lead wire weighs more than six thousand tons. Assuming that each train car carries thirty tons, more than one car cannot transport it. Shuyi is a remote county and must not have this large amount of lead wire. As for the wooden stakes, they were requisitioned from Donghai County. The number of sacks and rush mats is also untrue. It can be inferred. When the new embankment collapsed, the county magistrate did not send a single person to plug the breach. Please investigate and verify. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingjiangpu) Xu Xinwu, Director of the Ministry of Water Resources' Project to Divert the Huai River into the Sea, went to the province on official business. Regarding the second phase of the project, he received an order from the province to start work on the 1st. Due to the rain, all 80,000 workers in each section arrived at work today and are scheduled to have 160,000 people from each county arrive at work by Double Ten Festival. Liu Mengxi was invited to the site on the 1st to guide the Sanhe floodgates, and the film technicians sent by the province to film the night work were also delayed here due to the rain, but they are now going. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) After the breach in the Dayu River, the flood attacked the Longhai Railway base. Qian Zongze recently cabled the province requesting a quick solution to the breach. The provincial government has handed it over to experts for research. However, the opening is over seventy zhang wide, and it is surrounded by water, making it impossible to obtain soil, making it very difficult to plug. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Peixian telegrams that the water level has been stable for several days, but a strong easterly wind suddenly blew last night, and the water was turbulent. The embankments along the Gaoxiaohu Datun Longguji area suddenly showed seepage and frequent cracks. Fortunately, it was discovered early and blocked overnight, and the wind subsided slightly, so there was no danger. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Commissioner Shao and Yu Shufang, an inspector of the Provincial Construction Department, jointly drafted an industrial revitalization plan: (1) Dredging the Bulao River and Yan River, (2) Repairing the North Jiangsu Embankment, (3) Repairing the embankments on both sides of the Bulao River, (4) Building a movable wooden roller gate at the Lanjia Dam, (5) Requiring a total project cost of 3 million yuan, which was submitted to the province for approval on the 2nd. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Jiangsu Provincial Government Requests Subsidy for Ministry of Water Resources Project Funds</h3>
<p>Cable to the Ministry of Water Resources for Submission to the Central Government</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The provincial government cabled the Ministry of Water Resources to submit to the central government a request for a subsidy of 3.8 million yuan for the second phase of the Huai River diversion project, which is in urgent need of funds. The Central Political Council will submit it for discussion. (2nd Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) The central government issued 10 million yuan in disaster relief bonds. As Jiangsu Province has suffered severe disasters due to floods in neighboring provinces, it plans to request the allocation of a portion to help the disaster victims. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Baotou Yellow River Floods; Rural Areas All Submerged</h3>
<p>Sui Provincial Government Sends Personnel to Investigate Disaster Situation</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A telegram from Suiyuan states that the Yellow River in Baotou County is flooding severely, and the first, second, third, fourth, and fifth rural districts are all submerged. Residents are fleeing to the Nansha Liang area. The autumn crops are all submerged. The provincial government has sent Commissioner Liu Xiaoxian to investigate the disaster situation and plans to build a riverside embankment of one hundred and eighty zhang to prevent flooding. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Economic Committee Sends Personnel to Inspect Liutang</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Economic Committee sent technician Yang Baopu along the Central Canal to inspect Liutang River and went to Donghai, Guanyun, and Shuyang counties to investigate the capacity of major rivers such as the Chai Mi Yan River and the waterways to the sea. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tax Revenue Decreases in Hubei After Floods</h3>
<p>(Hankou) According to statistics from the Hubei Provincial Finance Department, the loss of tax revenue due to this year's floods is estimated at 1.18 million for field tax, 380,000 for deed tax, and 1.06 million for business tax in provincial taxes, totaling 2.64 million yuan. County taxes are 1.15 million yuan, totaling more than 3.8 million yuan, accounting for 40% of the total revenue. The loss from the drought is still under investigation. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Materials for Plugging Breach Estimated at Approximately 2 Million Yuan for Straw and Stone</h3>
<p>(Jinan) The plan for plugging the breach has been generally determined, requiring 900,000 yuan worth of elm material and 1 million yuan worth of stone material. Kong Xiangrong is scheduled to arrive in Jinan on the 3rd to discuss the breach plugging plan. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The remaining embankment at Li Shengcun is still collapsing. Kong Xianrong telegraphed the Breach Plugging Association again today to urge the speedy start of reinforcement work. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) Ge Guangting, Chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Committee, went to Jinan at 10 PM on the 2nd to transfer to Beijing and contact the Ministry of Railways about the materials for plugging the breach. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Qingdao) The plan for Shandong to borrow old rails from the Jiaoji Railway to build roads for plugging the breach has now been abandoned. It is said that this is partly due to some diplomatic problems and partly because the rails stored at the Longhai Railway are sufficient. Ge Guangting is scheduled to visit the authorities of the Ministry of Railways in Beijing on the evening of the 2nd to report on the progress and will return to Qingdao in a week. (2nd Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Tongshan Relief Association Sends Disaster Victims Back Home</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) The Xubu Disaster Victim Reception Center has taken in more than 2,400 refugees. The Special Commissioner's Office handed it over to the county government for handling. However, Tongshan County is unable to raise such a large sum of money every day. An emergency meeting was held by the Relief Association on the evening of the 1st, and it was decided to send them back to their hometowns. On the morning of the 2nd, each person was given one yuan and each child was given five jiao. Jinpu and Longhai Railways were asked to provide special trains to send them back to their hometowns on the same day. All the sheds in the center were also demolished, and refugees were no longer received. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Shantou Case: Negotiations Have Not Yet Made Progress</h3>
<p>Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance Have Not Received Formal Reports; Guangdong Orders Shantou Municipal Government to Handle Properly</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the Shantou incident of Japanese rice merchants resisting taxes, the Ministries of Foreign Affairs and Finance had not received any formal reports regarding the case as of noon on the 2nd. However, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs has sent a letter to Gan Jiehou, the Special Commissioner in Guangdong and Guangxi, inquiring about the truth and ordering a thorough report. The Consul General of Japan in Beijing has not expressed any opinions to our authorities. It is expected that the case can be resolved by the local authorities through the proper channels. The spokesperson of the Ministry of Finance said that the collection of import duties on foreign rice is a type of customs revenue. All friendly countries must pay taxes according to the amount. Since the collection began, there have been no disputes. This time, the Japanese merchants seem to have been smuggling. Detention is a legitimate measure. It should not cause any disputes. Xiao Songqin, Superintendent of the Chaoshan Customs, has telegraphed the Ministry of Finance to report on the matter. However, the tax collection issue is not related to the customs. The agency responsible for collecting this inland tax is the Inland Revenue Bureau. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Chen Jitang, in order to avoid international disputes in the Shantou foreign affairs, ordered the Shantou Municipal Government to handle it properly. If the matter is serious, it must be telegraphed to the province for instructions. In addition, the method of cracking down on smuggling in Shantou is that goods stored in stores in the city must have a special tax certificate, otherwise, they will be treated as smuggled goods. (2nd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) According to Japanese sources, the Guangdong Provincial Government sent a representative to the Japanese Consulate to propose a peaceful resolution to the dispute in Shantou. However, they stated that the tax collection is related to the financial resources of the entire province and the country and cannot be canceled. However, the Japanese Consulate warned us that the lives and property of Taiwanese people in eastern Guangdong must be fully protected. Otherwise, if any unfortunate incident occurs, we will be fully responsible. Therefore, the resolution of the Shantou dispute has not yet made any definite progress.

<h3>Naval Issues and US Far East Policy</h3>
<p>-- Ang</p>
<p>Since the Anglo-German naval agreement was concluded in June, Britain had hoped to convene a naval conference in October. However, due to the turbulent situation in the Far East and Europe, and the complex nature of the naval issue itself, the naval conference has been difficult to hold. Britain has been the most active in coordinating naval issues. The United States and Japan have each stood firm and quietly awaited developments. Britain's planned to first contact France and Italy, and then negotiate with Japan once there was some progress. However, since the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, France and Italy have been unable to negotiate with Britain on naval issues. Japan considers the United States to be its main rival in the Pacific. Any agreement is of little significance without US participation. Furthermore, the international situation has undergone drastic changes, creating an opportunity to demand a good price. Britain's strategy of negotiating with Japan alone has not been as successful as it was with Germany. Now, with the dangerous situation in the Mediterranean and the frequent transfers of British ships in the Far East, it must once again seek compromise with Japan to secure its position in the Far East.</p>
<p>The Daily Mail and Daily Express, "die-hard" newspapers within the British Conservative Party, have recently spread rumors that Britain will invoke Article 21 of the London Treaty, the "Escalator Clause," and issue a notice to the United States. This claim has been denied by the US Ambassador to London to the US State Department. However, when President Roosevelt departed to inspect the Pacific coast, he first issued a statement saying that the US will adhere to its original naval policy. This seems to be a reaction to the aforementioned rumors. The British side's desire to invoke the "Escalator Clause" was previously reported by the London Daily Telegraph a month ago. At that time, the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs had already expressed its opposition.</p>
<p>When the London Naval Treaty of 1930 was concluded, France and Italy had unresolved disputes over naval equality. The so-called "Escalator Clause" (meaning "activity ladder") was included in the treaty, allowing any of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and Japan, to notify and invoke the clause to increase the construction of auxiliary ships when national security is threatened. The recent Anglo-German naval agreement also contains this provision. Britain is currently facing a situation where its maritime communication in the British Indian Ocean is threatened by Italy. It cannot be said that it has no intention of invoking this clause. However, as the United States and Japan have both expressed their opposition, another factor of dispute has been added to the complex situation of naval negotiations.</p>
<p>President Roosevelt's recent declaration on naval issues was motivated by the British press's tentative publicity. However, its effect is still aimed at Japan. Even if there is naval competition between Britain and the United States, it will not be as significant as the competition between the United States and Japan. The United States' naval policy is closely related to the Far East issue.</p>
<p>According to our observation, there are two approaches to the United States' Far East policy: one is passive and the other is active. We can use the words of two American scholars to illustrate this. According to Dr. Sears, a professor at Purdue University, "Although the United States occasionally shows anger towards the Far East, the United States' Far East policy has always been based on goodwill. In the future, it will continue to seek goodwill. It is difficult to say whether the Open Door policy still has meaning. There are no signs that the current government dreams of using force as its backing." This is an observation of the former tendency. According to Dr. Pride, a professor at the University of Washington, "The current US Far East policy has two ultimate goals. One is economic, which is to maintain equal commercial opportunities in the Chinese market, that is, to firmly adhere to the foundation of the Open Door policy. The other goal is political, which is to maintain the Pacific peace system established by the Washington Conference. These two policies are now in open conflict with Japan's policies. The American people are all worried that war with Japan will be mutually destructive. The US government is considering only applying pressure to Japan. There are three methods: (1) adhere to the non-recognition doctrine, (2) designate the Aleutian Islands as a defense zone, (3) prepare for naval construction competition. Although the US government's budget is not balanced, the US financial resources are sufficient to bear the huge cost of naval construction. If it persists for a long time, Japan, which is unwilling to fall behind, will inevitably follow it closely. These three types of pressure, although starting with replacing war, may still end up in war." This is an observation of the latter tendency.</p>
<p>However, judging from the recent situation, the United States' 74th Congress passed this year's defense budget, which amounted to ten billion US dollars. The United States has the advantage of terrain and is the most difficult country in the world to be attacked by enemies. Its huge military expenditure can be said to be unparalleled in the world. Now, President Roosevelt has made a declaration to implement the naval policy. The United States' attitude towards naval issues has become increasingly clear. Isn't its reflection in the Far East policy a positive tendency?</p>

<h3>Italian Army Prepares to Attack Ethiopia</h3>
<p>Italian troops on the Eritrean front are ready to advance on Abyssinia from Eritrea. A special correspondent for the Associated Press, after inspecting 200 miles of the Italian front line by car, learned that an attack was possible within 72 hours. The movements of the front-line troops indicate that a large-scale offensive is prepared to be launched, but no officer knows when it will be launched. This morning, the reporter and Mussolini's son flew to the front line by plane. The area experienced was very extensive. Looking down from the plane, it was felt that the morale of the Italian soldiers was very high. They have received rigorous training and endured the various hardships of tropical warfare. The terrain, unfavorable for modern warfare, has been transformed by the Italian army. The wilderness can now be used for troop movement without difficulty. Military roads and military telegraph lines have been completely laid out. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Italian Consul in Ethiopia Ordered to Leave</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: With the Italo-Ethiopian war imminent, the Italian Embassy in Addis Ababa is now selling off everything, including all the furniture and carriages in the embassy, in preparation for leaving the country. Only six Italian nationals remain in the Ethiopian capital. Italy used to have six consulates in Ethiopia, four of which have already been closed, and the consuls have left Ethiopian territory. In addition, the consul stationed in Harar has also been ordered to leave, but the consul stationed in Adwa is temporarily staying in place awaiting orders. It is also heard that the Ethiopian consul stationed in Asmara, the capital of Italian Eritrea, has also been instructed to leave. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<h3>Ethiopian Army Raises Spirits and Awaits Orders with Weapons at the Ready</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: A full mobilization order will be issued tonight. The Ethiopian Emperor has just instructed local authorities that this mobilization order is only a proclamation. When the mobilization order is issued, a religious prayer ceremony will be held in the palace. Civil and military officials, royal nobles, and journalists will all be present. At the same time, according to ancient Ethiopian customs, beacon fires will be lit on mountain tops everywhere to inform the public that war is approaching. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Ethiopian Emperor is still waiting for the opportune moment to issue his general mobilization order. According to sources here, the Ethiopian Emperor is still waiting for reports from Ethiopian envoy to France Heruy Wolde Sellassie and Ethiopian delegate to the League of Nations, the French national Qetché, both currently in Geneva. It is generally believed that war will break out after the mobilization order is issued, because it has become very difficult for tribal chiefs to restrain border troops. It is believed here that the Italian army is preparing to start military operations at Walwal, and launch a large-scale invasion of Ethiopia. Therefore, 25,000 Ethiopian troops are also prepared to resist Italian tanks and artillery with long guns and broadswords there. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<h3>Italian Submarine Fleet Anchors in the Red Sea to Intercept Arms Shipments to Ethiopia</h3>
<p>Ethiopian Authorities Take Preventive Measures; Many Arrested on Suspicion of Espionage</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: It is heard that 16 Italian submarines are currently anchored in the Red Sea in an attempt to intercept foreign ships carrying arms and war materials to Ethiopia. A special Reuters correspondent recently traveled to the Ethiopian border with British Somaliland. It is claimed that Ethiopian army authorities now expect a large number of defensive gas masks, rifles, and bullets to be shipped from Japan and the United States in the near future. These arms are being transported via the port of Berberah, 175 miles southeast of Djibouti, British Somaliland, in the Gulf of Aden. Several Somali tribes friendly to Italy are now tasked with intercepting arms shipments to Ethiopia and are closely monitoring the area along the Ethiopian-British Somaliland border. The Ethiopian authorities are also well aware of the activities of these individuals and have recently arrested many people suspected of being hostile to Ethiopia. The town of Jijiga has banned foreigners from entering. French authorities have now dispatched troops to guard the border to prevent the smuggling of arms. It is heard that there are currently two suspicious ships, without flags, cruising off the coast of French Somaliland. It is now believed that the ships are carrying thousands of machine guns intended to be delivered to the Ethiopian government. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: It is heard that Ethiopian authorities will soon be able to import large quantities of arms, ammunition, and gas masks from various foreign countries. Fearing interception by Italian troops, they are taking various measures to prevent this. In the city of Jijiga, 50 kilometers from the border with Italian Somaliland, foreigners are prohibited from entering. Furthermore, several foreigners have been arrested on suspicion of espionage. The defense forces in the northern Ethiopian province of Gondar are commanded by the famous General Gassaa. It is heard that General Gassaa's son, Adal (name) Gassaa (surname), has assembled 20,000 soldiers and concentrated them in the Salale region north of the capital to strengthen the rear of the troops led by General Gassaa.

<h3>Governor of Rome Requests Permission to Serve</h3>
<p>(Rome) Governor of Rome and former Minister of Corporations Bottai yesterday requested permission to go to East Africa for military service. This has been approved by Prime Minister Mussolini and he will depart soon. He recently published an article in "Il Messaggero," praising the corporate system, saying, "The corporate system is not an end in itself, but a means. What is the end? The strength of the nation and the welfare of the people. The Italian expedition to East Africa can promote the progress of the corporate system. We in East Africa are seeking sources of benefit for the masses, including the people of Abyssinia, who have not yet developed their resources. This is the implementation of an international corporate system." According to recent remarks by most members of the Fascist Party, they are inspiring the national spirit of sacrifice so that the government can take the necessary economic and corporate measures that require a long period of preparation. In short, the Italian invasion of Africa has brought a revolutionary atmosphere back to the domestic cabinet, which can be stated with certainty. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Italy Increases Purchase of German Coal; Secret Negotiations in Rome Break Down</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to reliable sources, secret negotiations between the German economic delegation and the Italian government regarding Italy increasing its purchase of German coal have broken down.

<h3>Yemenese Muslims Willing to Serve Ethiopia</h3>

<h3>Britain Reiterates Its Position; Does Not Want to Leave the League of Nations to Act Alone</h3>
<p>League of Nations' Decision on Sanctions Must Meet Two Principles; Must Encircle All Powerful Countries in the World; Explains Difficulties Regarding Inability to Act Forcefully in the Sino-Japanese Case</p>
<p>(London) Official circles here today explained Britain's attitude toward the Italo-Ethiopian issue, stating that Britain does not want to leave the League of Nations to act alone. Britain has done its duty by supporting the League of Nations in the current crisis. Whether the Italo-Ethiopian dispute can be resolved quickly depends entirely on how other countries do their duty. If the League of Nations proves to be ineffective, the British public will inevitably cease to pay attention to the League of Nations. Therefore, to keep the mechanism for peaceful resolution of international disputes intact, all governments must actively support it unanimously. If the League of Nations decides on sanctions in the future, these measures must be consistent with the following two principles: (1) All powerful countries must be included; (2) They must not fail due to the actions of non-member states. The second point is especially important when implementing economic sanctions. In terms of phenomena, the United States will not hinder the actions of the League of Nations, and Germany will not act recklessly, dragging itself into the vortex of the dispute. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini recently stated that Britain knew of Italy's wishes in Ethiopia as early as January of this year, but it was not until Cabinet member Eden's visit to Rome in June that Britain explained its attitude. This statement is inaccurate. Since the Walwal incident last December, there has been hardly a week in which Britain has not clearly expressed its concern about Italian policy, and especially its impact on the collective security system. There is no reason to say that the British government allowed Italy to harbor illusions. Regarding future issues, although there is no hope that war can be avoided, Britain will obtain the best results from the League of Nations machinery to the extent of its power, so that the war ends as soon as possible. As for the criticism that Britain took no action regarding the Japanese invasion of Manchuria, while its attitude toward the Italo-Ethiopian dispute is tough, it must be understood that without the participation of Russia and the United States, the League of Nations could not take any action in Manchuria. But today, the League of Nations can actively handle the Italo-Ethiopian dispute, and there is no reason for Britain to adopt a policy of folding its arms and standing by. British officials also stated that the British government is not pursuing its policy for private gain. Britain has an obligation to protect Lake Tana on behalf of Egypt and Sudan, but Britain is unwilling to carry out the plan to build a dam on the lake, which shows that Britain is willing to put its own interests lightly, and to prioritize the general and more important needs of the League of Nations' policy. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) It is learned that the British government has not only sought concrete expressions from France regarding the issue of sanctions, but has also made the same inquiry to other member states of the League of Nations. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>

<h3>On the Issue of Military Cooperation, Britain Quietly Awaits France's Reply</h3>
<p>French Attitude to be Decided at Tomorrow's Cabinet Meeting</p>
<p>(London) It was rumored that the British government had inquired of France what attitude France would take if the British fleet in the Mediterranean were attacked by another country. This statement has recently been confirmed by officials. Officials believe that Britain's asking this question of France does not mean bargaining with France, because Britain's views on European security issues have been indicated in Foreign Secretary Hoare's reply to the French government. Regardless of France's views, Britain's attitude has been determined and will not change. It is also heard that the French government will not respond to Britain's question until the cabinet meeting on Friday this week. Political figures expect that the French government's reply may approve assistance to the British fleet in the Mediterranean when necessary, but only to the extent of maintaining the principle of collective security. If further commitments are made, France may still be hesitant. Foreign Secretary Hoare has also stated that no action can be taken until the Council of the League of Nations has voted to pass the recommendations on the Italo-Ethiopian issue. It can be seen that if the British and French navies want to cooperate, they must do so within the framework of the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch, 1st)</p>
<p>(Paris) The French cabinet will meet on Friday afternoon. At the same time, according to newspaper commentary, it cannot be predicted how the French government will respond to the question Britain has asked France about what attitude France will take if Italian warships suddenly attack British warships in the Mediterranean. The "Debats" expresses the opinion that the French government's reply will not be preconceived. It also says that France is now absolutely free to tell Britain that the French government has no intention of interfering in the Ethiopian case, because we firmly believe that France should respect the principles of the League of Nations on the one hand, and not participate in sanctions on the current case on the other. The "Concorde" expresses an even stronger opinion, saying that it would be foolish to deliberately sacrifice Italy's friendship and join in a risky attempt from which France would gain nothing without receiving any reward from Britain. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Important Talks Between British and French Leaders</h3>
<p>(Paris) British and French leaders continued to hold important meetings here today. A French Foreign Ministry spokesman told an Associated Press reporter that if war breaks out during this European crisis, France will support Britain in nine out of ten cases. French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval met with British Ambassador Clerk today, and then the British Crown Prince invited Laval and key figures from the French military to lunch at the British Embassy. Today's talks are regarded as very important by people here, because Britain and France are asking each other for guarantees. It is learned that the two sides discussed the situation of Britain in the Mediterranean after the League of Nations votes to impose sanctions on Italy. The most important thing is France's attitude, because after the implementation of sanctions, Italy may single out Britain as deliberately provoking and demand that France help Italy against Britain. Britain requires France to state what attitude France will take if conflicts occur between Britain and Italy in the Mediterranean. The French cabinet is scheduled to meet on Friday to discuss. (National Telegram, 1st)</p>
<p>(London) According to today's news from the "Daily Express," French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval has assured British Ambassador to France Clerk that if Italy attacks Britain without provocation, then the French navy and air force will cooperate fully with the British army. (National Telegram, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Italian Newspapers' Remarks Sow Discord Between Britain and France</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian public opinion has not given up hope for the attitudes of Britain and France, believing that the French navy will not participate in sanctions actions in the Mediterranean. Even if Britain should still conduct friendly negotiations with Italy, and base negotiations on respecting Italian interests in East Africa. The "Popolo di Roma" stated, "France will not participate in sanctions actions to harm brotherly countries, and ultimately commit suicide." As for officials, they fear that the British government will put pressure on the governments of the United States and Germany to force them to participate in sanctions actions. (Havas dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>Provokes Painful Impression in Rome</h3>
<p>(Rome) The British note to France has provoked a painful impression in Rome. It is widely believed that Britain intends to blockade Italy, and then issued this note. Only the League of Nations can implement the blockade. Now that the British authorities are preparing for this before the League of Nations has made this resolution, Italians regard it as an unfriendly action. Italians are now reiterating that Italy has no intention of harming Britain and does not want to extend the war against Ethiopia to Europe. When Italy is doing its best to avoid conflict with Britain, and opportunities to salvage the war still exist, it is absurd to engage in promoting war. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Labour Party Congress Resolution; Advocates Imposing Sanctions on Italy</h3>
<p>(London) The Labour Party Congress today passed a motion by a large majority, approving the Labour Party Executive Committee's policy of advocating that the League of Nations apply sanctions if Italy and Ethiopia go to war. A total of 2,168,000 votes were in favor of this proposal, and only 102,000 votes were against it. London City Council Labour Party leader Morrison, concluding the sanctions debate, earnestly said that although the League of Nations has various shortcomings, it is the world's initial supreme government. Of all the things created by the World War, only this is still relatively satisfactory. Morrison also said that military sanctions cannot be deleted. If the League of Nations encounters failure in this incident, it will inevitably come to an end indefinitely. He believed that the armies of the British colonies should be placed under the League of Nations. This is not to say that the British colonies should no longer be protected by Britain. He still feels that Britain is the most suitable country in the world to govern colonies. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>Germany, Austria, and Hungary Take the Opportunity to Revive the Idea of the Triple Alliance</h3>
<p>Germany Proposes a Five-Year Non-Aggression Treaty to Austria; However, Berlin Believes That This Statement Has No Basis</p>
<p>(Vienna) According to reliable sources today, German Leader Hitler has instructed the German Ambassador to Austria, Papen, to propose to the Austrian government to conclude a five-year non-aggression treaty in advance. It is heard that if Austria is willing to conclude this treaty with Germany, then the German government is willing to make the following concessions: (1) Stop anti-Austrian government propaganda within Germany and Austria, and disband Austrian troops within Germany; (2) Germany will purchase more Austrian goods; (3) Cancel the 1,000 Mark blockade. At the same time, the German government requires the Austrian government to do the following: (1) Stop the anti-German attitude and participate in the alliance between Germany and Poland; (2) Stop the harsh policing laws imposed on National Socialist Party members within Austria; (3) Gradually release the National Socialist Party members imprisoned in detention centers. It is heard that the above plan has been agreed to by Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös and Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg. Gömbös's recent visit to Berlin is closely related to this matter. However, Austrian Deputy Prime Minister and Home Guard leader Starhemberg strongly opposes this proposal, because his power will be hit as a result. German Ambassador to Austria Papen is currently in Germany attending President Hindenburg's funeral. He will probably discuss everything with the Austrian Foreign Minister after returning to Vienna. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Official circles here said that the statement that Germany asked the Austrian government to conclude a non-aggression treaty has no basis at all. (Reuters dispatch, 2nd)</p>

This ship also has special equipment to defend against submarines and aerial attacks, and carries four Loire 130 seaplanes, with two launchers attached to launch the planes into the sky.

<h3>Moscow Newspaper Observes the Purpose of German-Hungarian Negotiations</h3>
<p>To Create a Central European Power Bloc; Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös Returns Home from Berlin</p>
<p>(Moscow) "Pravda" commented on the Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös's visit to Germany, saying, "On the eve of the outbreak of military action in East Africa, Germany took the initiative to convene negotiations between Germany, Poland, and Hungary. This is sufficient to explain the purpose of these negotiations. German imperialism hopes that when Italy is tied down by Abyssinia and Britain's attention is also focused on East Africa, it can find a way to consolidate its position in Central Europe. Its first move is to solve the Austrian question. To accomplish this goal, it must form a power bloc to threaten the Little Entente countries (especially Czechoslovakia). This issue is the topic of the Berlin negotiations. The creation of the German-Polish-Hungarian bloc is the starting point for destroying the Little Entente countries. Gömbös's trip to Berlin and the German-Polish-Hungarian negotiations tell people that the fascist forces are trying to undermine European peace and create a new military bloc to re-divide Europe."

<h3>US Democratic Party Official Inspects Europe and Returns Home</h3>
<p>Sanctions Against Italy Should Be Undertaken in Cooperation with Other Countries</p>
<p>(New York) Senator Thomas of Idaho, a Democrat, who recently visited England and Europe in a private capacity to observe the situation, has returned to the United States. He arrived here today and, speaking aboard the steamer Volendam, said, "In the event of war, the reasonable course for our country is to cooperate with other countries and refuse to export goods to Italy. As for strict neutrality, I have always supported it, but to say that the United States can isolate itself from the rest of the world is simply laughable." (Havas Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Naval Issues: Differing Opinions Within the British Government</h3>
<p>Expanding the Navy vs. Awaiting Negotiations: Reply to Japan's Note on Naval Agreement</p>
<p>(London) British naval expert Mr. Horder recently published an article in the Daily Telegraph, detailing various differing views among government officials regarding naval policy. He stated that official opinions can be divided into two factions. One faction advocates immediately strengthening naval armaments, replacing all old ships that have reached the end of their service life, and building new ships. The other faction opposes immediately expanding the navy, arguing that it would risk triggering a naval arms race between Britain, the United States, and Japan. Reportedly, when US President Roosevelt departed for the Pacific coast on September 29, he delivered a speech outlining the US government's naval policy, which seemed to issue a warning to Britain, stating that Britain should bear the responsibility for the consequences that would arise after the abolition of the London and Washington Naval Treaties. The faction in Britain advocating for the construction of new ships is using Roosevelt's speech as their basis and insisting that Britain must act quickly to avoid future problems. Regarding this matter, although the government has already approved a large-scale shipbuilding program, the specific details of shipbuilding will be determined after the UK has obtained results from naval talks with other related countries. (Havas Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign and Navy Ministries have reached an agreement on the Japanese government's response to the British government's notification regarding the disarmament conference. The result is a decision to express that Japan's disarmament policy remains unchanged and to reiterate that Japan's policy is aimed at developing a navy that does not threaten or invade, and to request that the British authorities consider this. The response is currently being drafted by the Foreign Ministry and will be submitted to a Cabinet meeting on the 4th. After formal approval, it will be telegraphed to the acting ambassador in the UK for a verbal reply to the British Foreign Office. The content is reportedly as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Japan's disarmament policy has already been explained during the preparatory negotiations last autumn and in the memorandum of August 21. The content is fixed and cannot be reconsidered. In order to implement disarmament in practice, the Japanese government advocates abolishing all forms of the ratio system to establish equal armaments.</p>
<p>(2) If Britain recognizes this fundamental policy, Japan is prepared to participate in the conference. However, both quantitative and qualitative restrictions should be implemented simultaneously because implementing qualitative restrictions alone favors the major naval powers, which Japan absolutely opposes. (United Press Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) It is reported that the Foreign Ministry has begun consultations with the Navy Ministry regarding the suggestion from Britain to convene a naval conference. However, Japan's naval policy has already been decided by the Cabinet, so the results of the discussion do not need to be submitted to the Cabinet. What Japan wants is genuine disarmament, the abolition of offensive weapons, including battleships and aircraft carriers. (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<h3>British Chancellor Announces: Huge Military Spending</h3>
<p>Little Surplus Expected in Annual Revenue: Currency Stabilization Also Difficult to Consider</p>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain warned the audience in a speech at a bankers' banquet last night that although tax revenues have been strong recently, there may not be a large surplus at the end of the year, as optimists have predicted. The Chancellor said that the increase in expenditures in the past six months has exceeded his expectations by approximately 10 million pounds, and the funds currently used to increase national defense are not yet included. The tax revenue surplus must be offset by this. At a time when the recovery process seems to be making real progress in most parts of the world, recent developments in foreign affairs have opened up new sources of concern, which he must address. The Chancellor then mentioned the gold standard, saying that restoring the gold standard would prevent Britain from using its price stabilization and cheap money policies to suit its domestic needs, and further declines in prices would be even more harmful to the dominions and colonies. He meant that the time when we could risk sitting idly by has not yet arrived. We must be patient a little longer until the international sky is clearer and the situation is more stable, and the dollar and franc no longer glare at each other. (Reuters Dispatch, 2nd)</p>
<p>(London) Chancellor of the Exchequer Neville Chamberlain, speaking today at the International Chamber of Commerce conference in the House of Lords, declared that due to the current European political situation, discussions on international currency stabilization are difficult to consider for the time being, and even preliminary tests cannot be carried out. Although Chancellor Chamberlain hopes that a global currency agreement may be discussed in the future and that the gold standard may eventually be restored, the current situation is very unfavorable for this difficult test.

<h3>Japan's China Policy: Internal Opinions Still Not Unified</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Although Foreign Minister Hirota has repeatedly explained the Foreign Ministry's proposed new China policy to Army Minister Kawashima, Navy Minister Osumi, and Finance Minister Kaya, seeking their understanding, the opinions of the four ministries—Foreign, Army, Navy, and Finance—remain conflicting and have not been fully unified. The key points of this new policy are to actively develop North China and prepare for war against the Soviet Union. Once the new plan is decided, Major General Yasuji Okamura, Chief of the Second Department of the General Staff, will be sent to China to deliver the plan to the Japanese garrison in North China and to implement it through the Japanese military attachés stationed in China. Okamura is expected to depart around October 10, first to North China, then to tour Central and South China to instruct on various key matters regarding China. The Foreign Ministry will also send personnel to accompany him to liaise with consular staff stationed in China. It is likely that Director Kurasawa of the Asian Affairs Bureau or Chief Shimosato of the First Section will be assigned to this task. (China United Press Dispatch, 2nd)</p>

<h3>US Silver Senators Dissatisfied with Silver Purchase Plan</h3>
<p>Demand Silver as Currency</p>
<p>(Washington) Senator Thomas, leader of the US silver senators, announced today that if the government has no intention of immediately making silver the basic currency, they will demand the adoption of currency management similar to that of the United Kingdom. This statement aims to prompt the government to change its silver policy, arguing that purchasing silver is meaningless if it has no use. Thomas also strongly criticized the Treasury Department's silver policy, accusing it of buying silver at extremely low prices and only willing to raise silver prices to prevent the collapse of the silver market. He went on to say that there is currently no guarantee that the government will continue to purchase silver. If silver purchases are abandoned, the current silver policy will cause significant losses to the government and mine owners. Thomas stated that a rift has emerged in the Senate and House of Representatives regarding the silver issue, saying that representatives from silver-producing states seem satisfied with the government, but he is not. "We will not stop until silver is coined at $1.29 per ounce. Otherwise, we would rather abandon the current plan and seek other methods." (National Telegraph Dispatch, 1st)</p>

<h3>Guangdong Province Reorganizes Finance</h3>
<p>Reorganization of the Board of Directors of the Municipal Bank: Provincial Bank Supplements Paper Money Fund</p>
<p>Guangzhou communication: The Guangdong provincial government's financial institutions have historically included the Guangdong Provincial Bank and the Guangzhou Municipal Bank. The Provincial Bank has a larger scope, while the Municipal Bank is limited to the Guangzhou urban area. The Municipal Bank issues approximately 600,000 yuan in paper money. At the beginning of the month, the bank's board of directors was ordered to reorganize, adding three directors from the Provincial Bank to form a new board of directors. The Provincial Bank's board of directors has dispatched Chen Yue, Huo Baochai, and He Shaoqiong, while the Municipal Bank has dispatched directors Liu Binggang and Li Luchao to form the new board of directors. Chen Yue was publicly elected as the standing director, and it was decided to hold regular meetings twice a month. The detailed rules of the board of directors have been drafted by Chen Yue. The business operations of the Municipal Bank will generally remain unchanged, but the amount of paper money issued by the Municipal Bank is limited to 3 million yuan. The Provincial Bank and the Municipal Bank will exchange paper money without regional restrictions. It is said that this joint effort between the Provincial Bank and the Municipal Bank is purely to circulate the provincial and municipal finance and increase financial strength. As for the Provincial Bank, the Department of Finance previously approved the imposition of a 20% surcharge on nine types of taxes (namely, special tax on foreign paper, cattle hide tax, cattle slaughter tax, sugar tax, special tax on wax, paper money and ghost money tax, pig slaughter tax, surcharges on various counties, miscellaneous special tax on imported agricultural products, etc.) to guarantee the issuance of provincial silver notes. The collection period was set for one year, starting from April 15th of last year. April 14th of this year was the expiration date. Within one year, the revenue from this 20% surcharge was only over 3.47 million yuan, which was significantly different from the original estimated amount. It was then approved to extend the collection of the surcharge for another six months, from April 16th of this year to October 14th of this year. Now, the expiration date of October 14th is approaching rapidly, but the tax revenue collected is only over 1.6 million yuan, which is still insufficient to meet the original tax amount. The Supervisory Committee for the Issuance of Paper Money of the Provincial Bank, after considering the situation, believes that it is necessary to extend the collection of the surcharge again. It was then decided to extend the collection of the surcharge for the second time for six months, until April 15th of the 25th year of the Republic of China, until the original guaranteed amount of paper money issuance is fully collected, and then the collection will be stopped. The case of the second extension of the collection of the 20% surcharge on nine types of taxes was sent to the Department of Finance yesterday for submission to the provincial government for review and implementation.</p>
<h3>The Wan Gong River Bursts: Hai and Su Counties Suffer a Great Calamity Together</h3>
<p>The Town of Tanggou Sinks, Cries Echo Through the Fields: Two County Magistrates Have Submitted Their Resignations Taking Responsibility</p>
<p>Ba Jiang News: Recently, although the water situation in northern Jiangsu has gradually stabilized in the upper reaches, the flow in the lower reaches continues to increase. Rivers such as the Zhongyun, Liutang, Chaimi, and Shaoxiang have successively burst, and Donghai, Guanyun, Siyang, and Shuyang counties have suffered a great calamity together. Yesterday, a friend came to this town from Hai and Su counties, according to the report from Xuhai, the water situation is roughly as follows. The Yellow River breach is currently undergoing surveying work, but the blocking project has not yet been rushed to completion. However, its flow is extremely small, and the water level of Weishan Lake has also returned to normal, so the water situation in the upper reaches has stabilized. However, the lower reaches continue to rise. On the morning of the 27th, the right bank of the Wan Gong River in Shuyang, opposite Dashi Zhuang, burst, and the water poured towards Tanggou, with great momentum. In less than three li, the Dinggou water was blocked by the transverse weir built by Guanyun, and the accumulated ground water gradually rose. Residents are already surrounded by water, unable to escape. At that time, Guanyun troops were lined up on the opposite bank. At 8 PM, the levee near the Ma Hong area of Tangshan on the left bank suddenly tore, and at the same time, the levee on the opposite bank burst, and the water rushed into the river, and the water head suddenly rose by more than ten feet. At this time, the two county magistrates of Hai and Liu counties supervised the people and the law, and more than 1,500 people rescued them, but the people were discouraged because the opposite bank was breached, and the people's hearts were scattered. The two county magistrates, seeing this situation, were very anxious, and wept and persuaded the people, explaining the great righteousness of resisting the water. It was still in progress, and suddenly the opposite bank opened fire, and the work was frightened and escaped without a trace. However, the two county magistrates of Hai and Liu counties still could not bear to give up and negotiated with the opposite bank to stop the shooting, but no one answered. As a result, more than 500 people were gathered again from the six large and small lakes to rescue them for the second time, but 200 meters away from the construction site, more than 20 zhang were breached again, and it was impossible not to give up. As a result, Tanggou sank, half of Shuyang, and the sound of crying echoed through the fields. Now I heard that the county magistrates of Liuyang and Donghai believe that although this disaster was caused by artificial reasons, they are willing to take the blame and resign, and report to the provincial government to the effect that they are doing the right thing to the local area. In addition, according to news from the Department of Construction, the department attaches great importance to the breach of the Wan Gong River, and has sent water conservancy engineer Guan Fuquan and technician Xu Minghe to the Yishu tail area to inspect the flood prevention situation. Regarding the misunderstanding between Hai and Liu counties and Guanyun County due to flood prevention, Hai and Liu said that the breach of Liuguan Chaimi was caused by Guanyun building a dam in the Liuli River. Xu, the magistrate of Guanyun, said that the construction of the dam in the Liuli River was not related to the breach of the Chaimi River, and has telegraphed the province to report the situation of the dam construction and requested that personnel be sent to investigate to clarify the responsibility. The provincial department plans to find a proper way to first resolve the misunderstanding between the two parties and work hard on the embankment to avoid the expansion of the disaster area, and will send personnel to inspect if necessary. (October 1st)</p>
<p>Songjiang: The Chamber of Commerce Telegraphs Request to Retain the County Magistrate</p>
<p>The news that County Magistrate Jin Tigang's resignation was approved arrived in Songjiang. The County Chamber of Commerce sent a telegram to Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government and Director Yu of the Department of Civil Affairs, pleading to retain him, stating roughly: "County Magistrate Jin has been in office for one year and has achieved remarkable results. He has made many contributions to local administration, especially in terms of Baojia system, opium suppression, and construction. He has a revolutionary spirit and works hard, which is rare among current administrative officials. Recently, we saw in the newspaper that the County Magistrate's resignation has been approved by your Excellency. The Association was shocked to hear this, and specially telegraphed your office, asking you to withdraw the order and retain him, so as not to cause regret." (The following is omitted) The telegram was sent on the 2nd.</p>

<p>Wuxi: The Zhenxin Yarn Factory is Transferred for Takeover</p>
<p>The Zhenxin Yarn Factory incident outside the West Gate was handled impartially by the provincial party department last month and was resolved. All workers' saved wages, savings, and subsidies were paid out by the factory yesterday under the supervision of the party, government, and chamber of commerce. The salaries of the factory's employees have also been sent to the chamber of commerce by the factory for safekeeping. After the mediator, Mr. Xue Mingjian, agrees on the distribution procedures, a conclusion can be announced within days. Jiang Zeqing, the manager of the factory, has been ill for a long time and has expressed a passive attitude towards the factory's affairs, so he has firmly decided to resign. Now, a well-known yarn industry magnate adjacent to the factory, seeing that the Zhenxin yarn and cloth factories are fully equipped and that it is a pity that they have been shut down, and that many workers have lost their jobs, and that the future of the yarn market is stable, has proposed to invest in taking over the factory. He has been actively working in Shanghai in recent days and has obtained the consent of the Shanghai Bank, and it will soon become a reality.</p>

The right little foot was broken, and the right back was injured and bleeding. It was observed that it was crushed by the train from Shanghai to Beijing at around 4:30 PM. He immediately ordered Zhen Ding to guard the corpse and reported to the First Branch and then to the local prosecutor's office to send personnel to verify the incident. However, the corpse was naked and the circumstances were bizarre. There are currently no relatives claiming the body, and it is impossible to determine whether it was crushed to death or murdered.</p>

<h3>Minister Kong Speaks on the Current Financial Situation: Major Banks Will Absolutely Not Be Shaken. He Hopes the People of the Country Will Not Lightly Believe in Baseless Rumors.</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reporter met with Kong Xiangxi, Vice President of the Executive Yuan, Minister of Finance, and President of the Central Bank, and asked about the government's measures regarding the current social, economic, and financial situation. He said: Since the economic recession has affected our country, industry and commerce have gradually declined, and the market situation has deteriorated. Moreover, due to the financial community's caution and conservatism caused by various rumors, they have been very careful about loans. The market has become stagnant day by day. For the past year, the Ministry of Finance, due to its responsibilities, has been trying its best to provide relief. People's hearts have begun to stabilize, and the market has gradually stabilized. According to reports from the responsible departments, exports have increased sharply recently, and except for the flood-affected counties, all regions have celebrated a good harvest. The social economy should become more active day by day. However, recently, there have been people who do not understand the truth, who have listened to unscrupulous elements, who have fabricated various rumors about the banks for their own selfish purposes. This has led to the spread of false information and disrupted the market. This not only confuses public opinion but also violates the law. It should be known that banks with well-known reputations have a long history and a solid foundation in serving society and consolidating finance, and will absolutely not be shaken. Moreover, in order to consolidate the national economy and protect the people's savings, the government must also provide strong assistance as its backing. The rumors fabricated by traitors are entirely malicious. I hope that the people of our country will not lightly believe them. The slanderous schemes of the rumor-mongers will only disturb and harm themselves.</p>
<h3>Money Trade Association, Held Representative Congress Yesterday</h3>
<p>He Zhongxiao and Eight Others Elected as New Executive Committee Members, Sworn into Office, First Meeting Scheduled</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Trade Association held its second provisional representative congress at 2 p.m. yesterday at its Ningbo Road location. A total of 184 member representatives were present, including Li Shoushan, Yun Qing, Shao Yanshan, Xi Jiming, Zhang Mengzhou, Chen Lishan, Chen Shengwu, Sheng Xiaoshan, Liu Wuqiao, Qian Yuansheng, Yan Dayou, Zheng Bingquan, Feng Yigui, Feng Meiqing, Chen Songquan, Xie Tianbao, Zhao Zifeng, Ye Xiuchun, Sheng Mengli, Chen Hongqing, Gu Xueqing, Zheng Boren, Zhao Songyuan, Chen Runjin, Zhang Dafu, Qi Ziquan, Feng Zexuan, Shen Liangliang, Wang Jiemei, Yao Deyi, Xu Shanchang, Wang Zhongshu, Hu Chunxiang, Qin Zhenfu, Xu Wenqing, Shen Jiuyu, and 154 others. The Municipal Party Headquarters sent Zhu Yakui, the Social Affairs Bureau sent Song Zhongqing, and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent Luo Qinghua to attend for supervision and guidance. Qin Qiqing, manager of the Money Trade Preparation Bank, was also present as an observer.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>The congress began with Chairman Qin Runqing presiding and Ge Huaiqing taking minutes. After the formalities, the chairman reported, saying that today marks the second re-election period for the association. It is an honor to have representatives from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Social Affairs Bureau, and Municipal Chamber of Commerce present to supervise the election and provide guidance. Since the first re-election on October 2, 1933, it has been exactly two years today, and a re-election is required according to the regulations. Since Runqing and others were entrusted with the responsibility of committee members due to the misplaced affection of fellow traders, they have served during a period of economic decline, and they feel deeply ashamed for having achieved little and failed to live up to the expectations of their fellow traders. Moreover, in the past two years, the financial turmoil has surged, and our industry has been at the forefront, facing storms and crises. Faced with this dangerous situation, the committee members have been deeply concerned and have worked tirelessly to strengthen the industry itself and to cope with the changing environment. Fortunately, with the support of the authorities and the supervision of fellow traders, although there have been some setbacks, the overall situation has not been affected. The twists and turns of this process are appreciated by all traders. We are all in the same boat, and future troubles are far from over. Coping with everything in the future will be even more difficult than it is now. From now on, if our industry wants to stand firm and remain invincible, we must adapt to the trend, gradually innovate all facilities, maintain a prudent business policy, and strengthen unity among traders. By doing so, we can avoid being eliminated by natural selection and promote our industry. Now that the representatives present have reached the legal quorum, I hereby announce the opening of the meeting and respectfully listen to the instructions of the superiors, which will be of great benefit to us.</p>
<p>Party and Government Instructions</p>
<p>(1) Zhu Yakui of the Municipal Party Headquarters stated that today he represents the Municipal Party Headquarters to participate in the representative congress of your association. The punctual arrival of everyone sufficiently demonstrates the admirable spirit of your association. Your association's election has been held for two years, during which the market has undergone drastic changes. Qianzhuang have a long history and, like the Banking Association, are part of the same financial group, closely related to industry and commerce. Since the financial panic last year, the market has been extremely depressed. How to work hard to restore the economy is the urgent task for the future. However, China is an agricultural country, and farmers account for more than 80% of the population. Therefore, to revive the market, it is first necessary to revive the countryside and increase purchasing power. The rampant bandits in the interior are also the reason for the decline of the countryside. Assisting the rural economy and consolidating the rural foundation will make it easier to revive Shanghai and make the market prosperous. (2) Song Zhongqing of the Social Affairs Bureau said that today is the second re-election representative congress of your association. It is a great honor for me to participate. The Party representative has already detailed the relationship between your association and industry and commerce, so I will not repeat it. For thousands of years, our country used to barter, without currency as a medium. Later, it was found to be inconvenient, and substitutes were invented. Initially, shells were used, followed by currency. Silver and money are the medium of exchange. The credit of the qianzhuang industry is well-known and carries unlimited responsibility. Now that the market is so depressed and industry and commerce are extremely depressed, the silver and money industry bears the greatest responsibility. How to save people and save oneself is something that the leaders of the qianzhuang industry present should study together. (3) Luo Qinghua of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated that today Qinghua represents the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce to attend the second representative congress of your association. I am extremely honored to meet with the elders of the qianzhuang industry. Qinghua is also employed by the Silk Industry Bank, so indirectly, I can also be said to come and observe as a colleague. Because of the usual business relationship, it feels even more cordial to be together today. Therefore, I feel that what I want to contribute to your association should be straightforward and candid. People often refer to the qianzhuang and banking industries as the financial industry. According to the definition of finance, "jin" means currency and "rong" means circulation. Therefore, the business of the silver and money industry is to circulate the economy, and the principle is to grant and receive credit. In recent years, our country has suffered frequent natural and man-made disasters internally and has been hit by economic waves externally, resulting in the decline of all enterprises, the tightening of credit, and the extreme situation. Society is filled with a gloomy and uneasy atmosphere, and different opinions are rife, with no consensus. Some advocate currency expansion, repeating the mistakes of others, while others advocate bartering, returning to primitive life. In a declining world, rumors only serve to confuse people. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has conducted detailed research and believes that the current problem is not the lack of payment chips, but the exhaustion of credit chips. To correct this problem, it is necessary to establish a credit system. The qianzhuang industry is a historical financial organization in our country. Prosperous cities throughout the country, even remote towns, have qianzhuang establishments. Historically, they have been particularly cautious in granting and receiving credit because they are unlimited organizations, and most shareholders are wealthy, so society has faith in them. As for the Shanghai qianzhuang industry, because colleagues can unite and communicate with each other, the credit is even better. Qianzhuang drafts have always been regarded as cash by industry and commerce. On the one hand, the qianzhuang industry is more familiar with the credit investigation of the industrial and commercial sectors, sometimes surpassing any expert. Therefore, the credit loans of industry and commerce are mostly from the qianzhuang industry. Since our country has encountered an unprecedented economic crisis, the business of the qianzhuang industry has inevitably contracted. However, the world is suffering, and since we believe that only by establishing a credit system can we overcome the current economic difficulties, colleagues in the qianzhuang industry should continue to work hard based on their experience and not lightly shirk their responsibilities. In view of the establishment of a joint reserve by your association in recent years to increase the credit of colleagues, it is sufficient to prove the spirit of unity among colleagues, which is worthy of praise by the public. I hope to expand this scale and work together to deal with the current economic crisis, follow the meaning of human evolution, and improve business at any time to adapt to the modern environment, so that the colleagues of your association can carry forward and benefit the national economy. How could it be superficial?</p>

<h3>Resolution to Return Half of Relief Loans to Qianzhuang First</h3>
<p>If Necessary, Loans May Still Be Borrowed</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance's relief loan to qianzhuang is 25 million yuan, originally planned as 18 million yuan from the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications, 4 million yuan from various commercial banks, and 3 million yuan from the Money Trade Reserve. The lending and repayment methods are all handled as above. The commercial banks that borrowed the money have recently seen a great need for rural lending, and the local money market has gradually eased. They have written to the Shanghai Money Trade Supervision Committee to quickly instruct the various qianzhuang to repay the loans. According to the Xin Sheng She reporter, if the relief loans to qianzhuang are to be repaid in one lump sum, it is actually difficult to achieve. In order to take into account the interests of both lenders and borrowers, it was resolved that each qianzhuang should first repay a portion of the loan within the month, aiming to repay the full amount of 3 million yuan originally lent by the Money Trade Reserve, and repay half of the 4 million yuan lent by the various commercial banks. Repayments will continue in the future. However, if qianzhuang need to borrow money after repaying the loans, they may still borrow from the various commercial banks within the scope of the loans. It is said that the various commercial banks have agreed. The various qianzhuang have successively repaid the loans to the Central Bank, and a certain amount has already been accumulated. It is expected that the original plan to repay half of the loans lent by the various commercial banks can be repaid on schedule.</p>

<h3>National Federation of Commerce Chairman Lin Kanghou Publishes "Observations on Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation"</h3>
<p>Economic cooperation is not only necessary but essential, but obstacles to cooperation must be eliminated and prevented as much as possible. Sino-Japanese trade associations should be formed by both parties.</p>
<p>Lin Kanghou, Chairman of the National Federation of Commerce, is scheduled to depart for Japan on the 6th of this month for an economic study tour. He has specially published an article on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation to draw the attention of the people of both countries. A reporter from the New Sound News Agency has specially sought to record the original text as follows: Before discussing this topic, I will quote Mencius's words: "Go out and enter as friends, watch and help each other, and support each other in sickness." I will also quote a Chinese proverb: "A golden neighbor is better than silver relatives." I will also quote a traditional Chinese motto: "Be kind to neighbors and treat them well." From the three items quoted above, we know how much the Chinese people value their neighbors. This is true for individuals, and it is also true for countries. Why is this so? It is because we want "economics" to be able to lift each other up and achieve mutual benefit. Economic support between Chinese rural villages: (1) Mutual labor assistance, for example, on a certain day, two people from household A go to household B to work, and on a subsequent day, two people from household B go to household A to work, called returning labor. This is assistance in terms of service. (2) Mutual borrowing of farm tools and mutual exchange of seeds. This is assistance in terms of materials. (3) Household A asks household B to plow the fields and remove weeds, and household B asks household A to thresh grain and grind it. This is assistance in terms of technology. The above three types of support are not due to coercion or threats, or based on one party's opinion, forcibly imposed. Therefore, the neighbors are very friendly to each other, and the scope of economic support is even broader, such as helping each other with weddings, funerals, and celebrations. If there is a shortage, they share what they have. From this, we can see that economic support is essential and indispensable to mankind. International economic assistance can be used as an analogy. But in fact, we have gained an experience, that is, for example, if someone, Mr. A, relies on his wealth and power to treat his neighbors, he either encroaches on their land, or interferes in their family affairs, or forces them to obey him, and is arrogant everywhere. Then the neighbor fears him like a tiger and avoids him like a cat. On the surface, it seems that he can do whatever he wants, but in reality, he will never get the neighbor's economic assistance. It is tolerable in peacetime, but it becomes very difficult in times of crisis. Some people think that Mr. A only needs to control the neighbor and use his power to make him submit, so that he has no choice but to engage in economic support. In fact, if there is no emotion and the interests are different, even between father and son, husband and wife, and brothers, no fruitful economic cooperation can occur. And if the people completely believe that the government's economic policy is unfavorable, it is difficult to implement. If Mr. A uses coercive means to seek economic assistance from his neighbors, the result will be like an adult helping a child, rather than economic cooperation between adults. Between China and Japan, in terms of geography, history, race, and culture, economic cooperation is not only necessary but essential. But if we calmly and quietly recall the past, grasp the present, and observe the future, are there any obstacles to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation? Considering the facts, I am afraid that both Chinese and Japanese people will find it difficult to deny that there are no such obstacles. Since there is such an obstacle, we should strive to remove it in order to achieve the purpose of economic cooperation under the meaning of the Mencius quotation mentioned earlier. In ancient times, Japan took China as its teacher. In modern times, China takes Japan as its teacher. But when Japan took China as its teacher, Japan did not lose its sovereignty, and only looked to China for orders. When China takes Japan as its teacher, it naturally does not want to lose its sovereignty, and only looks to Japan for orders. Even learning from a teacher should not be like this, let alone economic cooperation. Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is definitely not unnecessary but essential. This is a future fact that no one can deny. That is, when Chinese and Japanese people fully recognize that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation is inevitable, they will be able to find ways to eliminate the obstacles left over from the past and present as much as possible. The scope of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation includes service, technology, and materials. Within this scope, not only does China need help from Japan, but Japan also needs help from China. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation should first establish the following principles: (1) Recognizing the indispensability of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. (2) Eliminating all existing, future, or planned obstacles to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. (3) Developing as much as possible the necessary emotional and instrumental elements to promote Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. As for the central structure of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, it should be divided into two aspects: one is the government, and the other is the people. But both must have a unified and fair policy. As for the steps, on the Chinese side, first, the national economic organizations should be united and integrated, and all industries should be built into three-dimensional systems. It is absolutely impossible to continue to be scattered and unrestrained, each acting on its own. Otherwise, the national economy cannot cooperate, how can it cooperate with foreign countries? Although this can be done by people automatically, the responsibility for supervision still lies with the government. The Chinese government should establish an economic policy, emphasizing agriculture and industry or suppressing commerce, depending on the needs of the facts, and set a five-year or ten-year plan. On the Japanese side, its economic organization is much more advanced than China's, but in developing its national economy too rapidly, it inevitably contains political means and the mistaken idea that advancement is easier. There are many past examples, which need not be repeated. If economic cooperation is desired, all political and military actions should be considered not only not easy to promote Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, but also sufficient to hinder Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Although it may not immediately lead to a lose-lose situation, in the end, it will inevitably suffer the consequences. From the current world situation and the internal economic situation of China and Japan, it is difficult to escape this conclusion that we are extremely unwilling to have. The most important thing is that merchants from China and Japan who engage in mutual trade should first unite and have their own organizations. These Sino-Japanese organizations will act jointly. With this union, the separation between the Chinese and Japanese people can be avoided, and this organization can also potentially promote close relations between the Chinese and Japanese governments. In addition to the above-mentioned organizations, leaders of the Chinese and Japanese people should form two Sino-Japanese trade associations and unite with each other to determine the content and means of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, so that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation can move from words to reality. In short, the economies of China and Japan should be promoted under the spirit of equality and mutual respect. The result will be that the Chinese and Japanese people will deeply recognize the true meaning of "Go out and enter as friends, watch and help each other, and support each other in sickness," "A golden neighbor is better than silver relatives," and "Be kind to neighbors and treat them well," and look forward to the broad road of peaceful coexistence and co-prosperity.</p>
<h3>Mining Finance Coordination Association Explains the Nature of the Association</h3>
<p>In view of the depression in the mining industry, seek relief, and provide financial assistance to mining merchants in various provinces.</p>
<p>According to the New Sound News Agency, there are still unclear questions about the nature of the Mining Finance Coordination Committee of the Ministry of Industry. Yesterday, they specially released the following message in writing to the reporter of the New Sound News Agency: The Ministry of Industry, in view of the recent depression in the Chinese mining industry, has specially organized the Mining Finance Coordination Committee for the purpose of relief. Anyone who needs financial assistance, regardless of the province or type of mining company, can submit an application to the Ministry, which will be approved and submitted to the Committee for investigation and approval. Those who are deemed qualified and can repay the principal and interest on time and have reliable guarantees can enjoy this benefit. However, foreign newspapers still do not understand the truth. As reported by the Tianjin North China Star Newspaper on the 27th of last month, there are many misunderstandings about the nature of the Association. The Association has sent a special letter to the newspaper explaining everything and asking it to correct it.</p>
<h3>Japanese Fishing Boats Invade Our Territorial Waters, Japanese Embassy Agrees to Take Action</h3>
<p>Japanese fishing boats often cross the border to fish in the waters off Zhejiang Province, infringing upon our maritime rights. The Zhejiang Provincial Government has telegraphed the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to protest to Japan. Now we have received a note from the Japanese Embassy stating that the Japanese authorities have always taken practical measures to crack down on Japanese fishing boats fishing in Chinese territorial waters, and will continue to use the same approach in the future. However, when the Chinese side protested this matter, it only mentioned a certain number of ships, which made it impossible to investigate. If such incidents are discovered in the future, the ship's name, port of registry, the name of the captain or person in charge, and other necessary information for the investigation should be provided in detail before action can be taken. The Provincial Government has forwarded this note to the special commissioners of Yin, Linhai, and Yongjia, the county magistrates of the coastal counties, and the Second Marine Police Brigade for their information.</p>

<h3>The Red Swastika Society's Relief Efforts in Hanyang and Hanchuan</h3>
<p>After the Yangtze River flood occurred, Wu Heguang, the chief captain of the Red Swastika Society, immediately formed a team led by Captain Ouyang Dulin to Wuhan for relief. Now we have received a report from the Shanghai General Office of the Association from the forward relief team, which is recorded as follows: On July 5, our team distributed medicines in the area of Wutai Gate, Wusheng Gate outside the Kai Zi Gate, and the Glass Factory and Jinbaisha River in Wuchang to rescue the sick and disaster-stricken people. On the 10th, we took a small steamer to Hanyang, landed at Caidian in the second district, hired two rowing boats, and entered the Yuanjia Zui Baba Embankment, Fubai Ma Jiudou Embankment, and Donghu and Xihu, all the way to Chenggong Mountain and Yaojia Cen. After starting ashore at Songlin Zui, we passed through Xia Siling in Yu Chen Township and Zhenkong Valley, and went straight to the Yong'an Fort Market Town in the seventh district of the county. Along the way, the embankments were breached, the houses were destroyed, and it was a vast expanse of water, indistinguishable from the sky. After on-the-spot investigation, there were 1,525 households in the seventh district who could not survive without relief, and only 306 households in the third district. We distributed 200 bags of soybeans (broad beans), 200 bags of soybeans to Laocheng Rao in Yong'an Fort, 374 bags of No. 5 flour to Jurushan, 28 bags of pot scrub rice, 27 bags of fried wheat flour, and 7 bags of soybeans. We distributed 265 bags of soybeans to Jinniushan Berlin Store in Banzhu. We also found that there were 2,036 households in Tongle, Taihong, and Shengxian Townships in the second district. We distributed 298 bags of soybeans. After the Hanyang relief was completed, Captain Ouyang and his staff took a boat from X溝 to Hanchuan. At that time, Hu Zhongcheng, the captain of the third team, had been sent to Hanchuan by this office, and the work was combined. It was found that after the levee break in the fourth, fifth, sixth and third districts of the county, the areas near the town were all turned into swamps. The first, third and second districts were less affected. It is estimated that there are more than 110,000 disaster victims in the entire county who cannot survive without relief. We often started the inspection and distribution from the sixth district, which was the most severely affected by the disaster. It is estimated that there were 3,701 households and 16,687 disaster victims of all sizes in the five townships of the County River, Shenling, Gezhen, Dunshan, and Anle in the district. According to the principle of disaster relief to save the dying but not the poor, a total of more than 1,700 bags of flour were distributed. Now the distribution in the sixth district has been gradually completed. The two captains, Ouyang and Hu, and their staff will go to the fourth and fifth districts for inspection and distribution. Because the disaster situation in the fifth district is no less than that in the sixth district, it is still necessary to cross the water to go to and from the villages. Once there are wind and waves, the rowing boats cannot be used. This is the biggest difficulty. Of all the 4,090 bags of flour transported to Hanchuan, more than 1,700 bags have been distributed in the sixth district, and the remaining 2,300 bags are not enough to distribute in the fourth and fifth districts. It is estimated that more than 600 bags still need to be purchased. A total of 4,700 bags of flour were distributed in the third district. As for the first, second, third and third districts, soybeans were completely distributed, totaling 1,200 bags. The relief efforts in the entire county can be declared completed in the near future. During this period of intense work, the number of team members is not enough to distribute. It is planned to transfer more experienced team members to participate in order to speed up the process. This is the situation of the recent handling of the Hanyang and Hanchuan relief efforts by this team.</p>
<h3>The Disaster Relief Association Will Hold Public Donations, Entrusting Banks, Money Shops, Companies, and Stores to Collect Them on Their Behalf</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai Disaster Relief Association for the Provinces Affected by Flood has been calling on all parties to raise donations and allocate relief funds one after another because the disaster area is vast and there are many disaster victims. However, it is feared that it will be difficult to popularize the relief. In addition to planning dramas and martial arts to raise meager relief funds, it has entrusted banks, money shops, companies, and stores throughout the city to collect public donations for one month. The receipts are divided into seven types: 0.1 yuan, 0.2 yuan, 0.4 yuan, 1 yuan, 2 yuan, 4 yuan, and 10 yuan. It is heard that they have been collected and sent out, and will be started soon. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will donate generously and enthusiastically to support the great cause.</p>
<p>In addition, the Association has continued to receive 1,019.51 yuan from 20 households, including the staff of Shanghai Xinyu Textile Factory, the Shanghai Woolen Fabric Trade Association, Jin Shufang, Yang Jinghuan, Wang Jieren, and Sun Xueqiao of Yongxiang Bank. In addition, the Zhoupu Fuhua Charity Association has raised a total of 610 yuan, and the condolence money for Xu Fu's funeral has been used to help Ma Bolong, Wang Zhujiu, Xie Yangquan, Li Jingyan, Wang Zhongqing, Gao Jichao, Zhang Dingcheng, Luo Jinzhang, Tang Meihou, Liu Zhenhui, Zhou Dajing, Li Meiyin, Yang Mianzhai, etc., 123 households, 902 yuan. In addition, Mai Shushi, Yang Jinghuan, Anonymous, Deng's Residence, Kangji, etc., 190 pieces of old clothes and trousers, 3 old hats, 6 old quilts, and 300 packages of Qingkua Pian, Shiyi Water, and Hongling Dan.</p>
<p>In addition, the Association received 800 silver yuan from all the employees of Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving Factory on Qiqihar Road, Gaoqiao yesterday. The letter reads: Respected Sir, we have received your letter, indicating that since the summer of this year, the floods in various places have been extremely serious. You have instructed us to follow the example of the Commercial Press's salary donation method to provide relief. We have followed the example of the staff, students, and workers donating two days' salary each, and the factory has donated 800 yuan to make up the total.

<h3>Ningbo Industrial Bank's Resumption of Business is Underway, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Cables His Consent</h3>

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Instructs on the Doubts About the Use of Stamp Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent letters to the Chinese and Western Pharmacy and the Detai Glassware Company yesterday, instructing on the doubts about the use of stamp tax, which are recorded separately as follows:</p>
<p>Invoice Binding The Association replied to the Chinese and Western Pharmacy in a letter stating: Respected Sir, in response to your previous letter, asking whether the invoice for ordering goods from your pharmacy, which is bound into a book of five pages, should be affixed with stamps as one piece, etc., we have forwarded it to the Ministry of Finance for verification and replied to you in advance. Now, on the first day of this month, we received a reply from the Ministry of Finance in the Tax Letter No. 7290 stating: "We have carefully checked the winter telegram and its attachments. The invoice used by the Chinese and Western Pharmacy has a clear list of the main brand and a list of other brands. The list is also attached with a summary, which is bound as a copy. If the date of delivery, list number, and amount of goods and silver contained in each list are the same as those contained in the summary, and are delivered at the same time as the summary, it can be considered as one piece, and sufficient stamps should be affixed in the summary. Each list does not need to be stamped again. However, if there is only a list and no summary, each list should still be stamped separately in order to prevent trickery. You should immediately forward this to your subordinates for compliance." We have sent a letter for your record and reply, hoping that you will check and handle it accordingly.</p>
<p>Stamp Tax on Old Books The Association also replied to Detai Glassware Company in a letter stating: We received your letter on the first day of this month. We have learned that you are inquiring about the stamp tax on account books. Now we reply as follows: (1) For old account books that have not yet been used up, which have been stamped with one dime, and are still in use, they can be used until the end of the year. There is no need to add more stamps. (2) For old account books that have been used up by the end of August, which have been stamped with one dime, the situation is the same as above. There is no need to add more stamps. However, if the old book is used up by the end of August, and a new book is replaced on September 1, this new book must be stamped with two dimes, and its validity can only be calculated until the end of the year. If it is used continuously after the beginning of spring without replacing a new book, it must be stamped with another two dimes.</p>
<h3>Han Fuju Cables His Thanks for the Relief Clothing</h3>
<p>The weather is getting colder now, and the disaster victims in each district do not have enough clothes to wear, and urgently need relief. Moreover, the climate in Shandong and Henan is already cold, and the disaster victims in the disaster areas are even more distressed. The Shanghai Disaster Relief Association for the Provinces Affected by Flood on Yunnan Road in this city is paying great attention to the problem of clothing for the disaster victims, and the efforts to raise donations are very busy. Yesterday, we received a telegram from Chairman Han Fuju of Shandong Province stating: To the Disaster Relief Association for the Provinces Affected by Flood, we have received your letter. The relief clothing issued by your Association has been approved by the Disaster Relief Committee's telegram and handed over to the Yellow Disaster Relief Association for distribution. Your Association has been concerned about the disaster of the drowning victims, and has issued relief from the wasteland. The poor people have benefited, and the rumor of making new clothes has been spread. The people have been blessed, and the song of Zhao Su has risen up. We are deeply grateful. In addition to instructing the Yellow Disaster Relief Association to report the distribution situation in detail, we hereby send a telegram to express our gratitude. Han Fuju, 30 Mi Min.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Telephone Bureau Opens Central District Branch</h3>

The internal equipment and layout are extremely neat and perfect, and it has been praised as a model telephone bureau. All equipment adopts an automatic system, and in April of this year, the underground pipeline manhole and other projects were completed. In May, the overhead pole lines were effectively organized to ensure proper functioning. Subsequently, the telephone service was enabled at midnight on May 25, which was very convenient for all agencies, schools, and citizens in the city. The bureau, considering that the general public has not fully understood the organization of automatic telephones and the usual method of use, has taken advantage of the current National Games to open the branch during the games period for public viewing.

<h3>Taxpayers' Association Executive Committee Xu Xiaochu and Others Request Public Works Department to Economize Expenses: Market Decline Affects Tax Revenue, Advance Expense Reduction to Lighten Citizens' Burden</h3>
<p>Executive Committee members of the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Xu Xiaochu, Jin Zongcheng, Zheng Chengqing, Ma Shaoquan, Jin Runxiang, Sun Mingqi, Chen Ziming, Xu Guanqun, Su Jiaxing, Shen Tianxin, etc., jointly sent a letter yesterday to the Ratepayers' Association to forward to the Public Works Department, requesting advance expense reduction to avoid affecting the citizens' burden. The letter states: "We respectfully inform you that the impact of the recession has spread throughout the world, and Shanghai, which is known as the first commercial port in East Asia, has also been drawn into the whirlpool. The market is declining, commerce is withering, and financial institutions, such as banks and money shops, have been closing down and liquidating one after another. Companies and firms that have difficulty maintaining operations and cannot bear the heavy burden have gone bankrupt. Others have been sealed off by the courts for failing to pay rent. Under these extremely depressed circumstances, stores and shops that are still struggling to operate are only reducing staff and salaries to tighten expenses. Among the expenses of stores, rent is a major item. At this time of market downturn, the movement to reduce rents has reached a boiling point. The achievement of this movement is also inevitable. If the rent reduction movement succeeds, the Shanghai Municipal Council will be indirectly affected. The property tax collected by the Municipal Council is proportional to the rent. If the rent is reduced, the property tax will also be reduced accordingly. The source of the Municipal Council's administrative expenses depends on the tax revenue from businesses and residents within the district, which is the largest source of tax revenue for the bureau. According to the bureau's full-year budget for 1935, it reached over 11.8 million yuan. However, compared to the actual number collected from January to the end of June 1935, there was a shortfall of over 260,000 yuan. It is speculated that the situation in the second half of 1935 will be even worse, with more shops closing down and residents moving back to their hometowns due to the difficulty of living. The number of vacant houses will increase, and rent will be reduced even further. The reduction in property tax collected by the Municipal Council may be even greater than in the first half of the year. However, considering the administrative scope of the bureau, it seems that this has not been taken into account. Foreign staff often receive huge salaries, as well as various items such as exchange rates, rent, and education allowances. The public believes that the orchestra can be abolished, but due to the fondness of a few Westerners, they are willing to provide circumstantial evidence and misinterpretations to keep it in existence. The expenditure on this orchestra in the first half of 1935 reached over 125,000 yuan, which amounts to over 250,000 yuan for the whole year. Furthermore, out of the bureau's total tax revenue of over 25.2 million yuan, less than 5% is allocated to education expenses. This suggests that the bureau's regular expenses do not seem to be appropriate. We believe that the bureau should adopt the same attitude under the current state of recession in Shanghai, where the entire society is generally reducing staff, salaries, and expenses. Except for the need to maintain security within the district due to the increasing number of unemployed people and those who disregard the law, the police force's expenses cannot be excessively reduced. Other expenses should be scrutinized for savings, which would be a significant amount. This, along with the reserve for deferred taxes and shortfalls, is the bureau's current and essential task. Furthermore, the Shanghai Telephone Company disregards the market's downturn and the difficulties of commerce, and at this time, it is increasing the people's burden, stubbornly adhering to the provision of ensuring a 1% annual profit. It is determined to raise telephone fees, as if the people's opposition can be ignored, and the provision of an annual interest of 1% must be maintained. If the company could pay attention to internal expenses and slightly tighten unnecessary expenses in light of the market trend, we fear that not only would telephone rates not need to be raised, but also the so-called 1% annual interest would be guaranteed and even exceeded. However, it does not attempt to do this and focuses solely on the burden of telephone users within its sphere of influence. This is the same as the Municipal Council, which is not concerned about the shortfall in tax revenue and remains unmoved. Under these circumstances, we taxpayers and telephone users, upon considering the increasing burden in the future, find it difficult to remain silent. Therefore, we respectfully submit this to your esteemed association, requesting that you suggest to the Municipal Council and the Shanghai Telephone Company that they pay attention to implementing government reduction. This would not only be fortunate for taxpayers and telephone users but also beneficial to the future of the bureau and the company. This is addressed to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Shanghai Municipal Council."</p>
<h3>Held Yesterday: Fourth Group Wedding, 142 Couples, Each with a Happy Marriage</h3>
<p>The fourth group wedding in the city was held at the city government auditorium yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM. As it was a time of cool autumn breezes and the general public urgently needed a solemn and economical wedding ceremony, the number of applicants approved for this wedding reached 142 couples, 284 people, breaking the past record by a large margin. This trend is expected to make even greater progress.</p>
<p>Chinese and Foreign Guests Came to Observe</p>
<p>Yesterday was a sunny and warm day, a rare good day in autumn. About 2,000 Chinese and foreigners who were interested in group weddings gathered at the city government auditorium, and another 4,000 to 5,000 people were in the square in front of the government building. Cars on Xianggu Road were endless, and it can be said that the scene was unprecedentedly grand.</p>
<p>Respectful and Harmonious, Enjoy in Advance</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the wedding participants arrived at the city government building one after another and gathered in the upstairs lounge.</p>
<p>(Wang Kai, photographer) During the fourth group wedding ceremony, the brides and grooms who came in casual attire changed into wedding dresses here. Because there were no bridesmaids to accompany them, there were often instances of brides and grooms helping each other with makeup. The joy of a respectful and harmonious marriage was enjoyed even before the wedding, which was something that the ancients had not expected.</p>
<p>Red Candles Burning High, Double Happiness</p>
<p>A red silk banner with the words "Shanghai Fourth Group Wedding Ceremony" in gold letters was hung in front of the auditorium. Upon entering, a red carpet led directly to the altar, where numbered magnetic signs were placed to allow the wedding participants to stand in their respective positions. The altar and the left and right sides were decorated with wedding items, with dragon and phoenix candles and five pairs of small candles shining brightly. The entire auditorium was dyed with a lot of color.</p>
<p>Silk Lanterns Lead the Way, Music Plays Harmoniously</p>
<p>At 3:10 PM, the wedding ceremony began. The brides and grooms were led by the chief of the Third Section of the Social Bureau, Zhang Binghui, and his wife, along with healthy and beautiful boys and girls holding brocade boxes and silk lanterns. The brides and grooms entered the auditorium from the stone steps of the main entrance, dividing into left and right sides and bypassing the arched door downstairs. The sight of over 200 wedding participants was spectacular. As they entered the gate, the string orchestra in front of the stage, namely the Public Security Bureau Orchestra outside the gate, began to play the "Wedding March." All the guests stood up and paid their respects to the newlyweds.</p>
<p>Couples in Love All Become Spouses</p>
<p>When the music stopped, the officiant, Mayor Wu Tiecheng, and the Director of the Social Bureau, Wu Xingya, took their places. The wedding ceremony began with the master of ceremonies, Wang Xianqing. (1) All the wedding participants stood at attention. (2) They paid the highest respect to the Party's national flag and the portrait of the late Mr. Sun Yat-sen. (3) The officiant read the wedding vows. (4) The newly married couples bowed to each other twice. (5) The officiant presented the marriage certificates and souvenirs. (6) The officiant gave a speech. (7) All the wedding participants bowed once to the officiant. After the ceremony, they left the auditorium in the same order and went to the front of the city government building to take a group photo before dispersing.</p>
<h3>Mei Lanfang Endures Illness to Perform on Stage, Eager to Relieve Disaster and Righteously Courageous</h3>
<p>Mr. Mei Lanfang recently returned from Europe and immediately performed famous plays in Nanjing and Hangzhou to raise funds for disaster relief, saving many lives. However, due to the arduous journey, he caught a slight cold. After returning to Shanghai, he immediately sought medical treatment. The doctor strongly advocated rest and forbade him from going out to rest. However, he still performed at the charity performance at the Golden Grand Theatre last night as usual, which shows his rare dedication to public service.</p>
<h3>Thirty-One Silk Mills in Shanghai Have Resumed Operations</h3>
<p>Due to the resurgence in silk sales in Europe and the United States and the increase in prices, the number of silk mills resuming operations in Shanghai has continued to increase. In the New Gate area, there are four mills, including Xiexing, Jingcheng, Youli, and Hengsheng, bringing the total to eleven mills including Meifeng and others. In the Zhabei area, Huifeng has been added, bringing the total to eleven mills including Hengcang and others. There are still five mills in the Hongkou area, one in the concession, two in South Shanghai, and one in Longbei, bringing the total to 31 silk mills in the city. However, due to the implementation of centralized control in Zhejiang Province, the source has been reduced, leading to a shortage of raw materials and a situation that is difficult to maintain. Currently, various factories are buying dry cocoons everywhere in order to reel them.</p>
<h3>Mutual Aid Society: Method Set for Electing Rickshaw Pullers' Representatives</h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of electing rickshaw pullers' representatives to the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society, according to the society's regulations, the election method must be approved by the Public Works Department's board of directors. The election method has now been drafted by the Mutual Aid Society's board of directors, slightly revised by the Public Works Department's Special Committee on Rickshaws, and then submitted to the Public Works Department's board of directors for approval. According to this method, in view of the large number of rickshaw pullers and the lack of experience in election procedures, it is stipulated that for every 100 rickshaw pullers, three impartial personnel will select one person as an elector. These electors (estimated to number about 400) will then elect two representatives to serve as directors of the Mutual Aid Society's board of directors. Detailed regulations for the selection of electors have also been stipulated. When electors nominate directors, they should personally go to the Mutual Aid Society's general office on East Jiaxing Road on the day of the election and follow the prescribed procedures. It is reported that the Public Works Department's board of directors has approved the rickshaw pullers' election method for the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Society.</p>
<p>Regarding the newly designed rickshaw style, rickshaw dealers and pullers have occasionally objected. After consideration by the Public Works Department's Special Committee on Rickshaws, according to the report of the Rickshaw Management Office, the recently finalized style has four improvements compared to the previous ones. Both rickshaw pullers and passengers have praised its convenience. The weight is lighter, the rider feels more comfortable, and the cost is not high, making it the most suitable vehicle on the market. Therefore, according to the office, the opposing voices from the outside have gradually decreased. The acting general manager of the Public Works Department also stated that the new-style rickshaw had previously been approved and implemented, and the number of rickshaws in circulation on the market is also increasing day by day. Therefore, today's re-raising of this issue is only to understand whether the issue should be reconsidered in light of external opposition and criticism. Subsequently, the Special Committee resolved that the issue should not be reconsidered, and this section has also been approved by the board of directors.</p>
<h3>Implementing Centralized Control of Kerosene: Chairman Chiang Kai-shek Cables to Request Expedient Handling by the Executive Yuan and Ministries</h3>
<p>Modern countries mostly use centralized kerosene because it is very important for the evolution of a country's industry and commerce. Recently, domestic oil companies made requests to the government authorities, and Chairman Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry separately, requesting them to jointly discuss solutions. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry specially sent a letter to the domestic oil companies requesting them to send representatives to the Ministry for consultation. The representative departed for Beijing last night.</p>
<h3>China Institute of Engineers: General Report on Association Affairs (III)</h3>
<p>(XI) Regarding the matter of the National Construction Report, at last year's annual meeting, member Xu Yuanqi and others proposed that the general association should submit a National Construction Report at each annual meeting. At the 15th board meeting, Yin Enyong was designated to draft the method. The 16th board meeting resolved to pass the method, and after sending a letter to each branch to contribute their opinions, the National Construction Report will be edited and implemented starting in 1935. The method will also be published separately in the Engineering Weekly. (XII) Regarding the matter of industry books, member Zhao Fuling authored the book "Steel Reinforced Concrete," requesting that the association accept and publish it as a series. After inviting experts Li Keng and Li Xuehai to conduct a detailed review, the board of directors resolved to publish and distribute it. Additionally, member Lu Zengqi's book "Maintenance and Repair of Locomotive Boilers" was also approved by the board of directors after being reviewed by experts Chen Mingshou, Shi Jian, Wei Yifu, Cheng Xiaogang, Zhu Baofen, etc. (XIII) Regarding the addition of terms for machinery and electrical engineering, most of our country's engineering terms are translated from European and American countries. However, the translations are mixed and inconsistent, which greatly affects the development prospects of our country's engineering knowledge. In view of this, the association compiled and printed various engineering terms from 1928 to 1929, which scholars found convenient. The first edition of machinery and electrical engineering was a draft, and the number of copies was limited. However, due to the great need from all walks of life, a committee was specially organized, and members Gu Yuxiu, Liu Xianzhu, etc., were designated to revise the machinery terms, which had over 11,000 items, and the electrical terms, which had over 5,000 items, both of which were four or five times more than the first edition. Shortly after publication, they were sold out. At the invitation of the National Compilation and Translation Bureau, the association selected review committee members.</p>
<h3>Pengpu Defense Corps: The Truth About a Corps Member Shooting Another Corps Member; The Suspect, Zhu Shaofu, Claims the Deceased Had an Affair with His Wife; The Suspect, Bullets, etc., Were All Transferred to the Xinzha Public Security Bureau Yesterday</h3>
<p>The case of Zhu Shaofu, a member of the Fourth Team, Zhangjiazhai Defense Post, Pengpu District Defense Corps in Zhabei, shooting his colleague, Wang Yutianxiang, was reported in yesterday's newspaper. Now, the confessions of the suspect Zhu Shaofu and Zhu's guarantor, Zou Guoguang, are recorded below. Zhu Shaofu confessed that he is 31 years old, from Siyang, and a member of the Pengpu Defense Corps. He has a wife, Liu, from Nanjing. In June of this year, she was seduced and taken away by Guoguang for more than ten days. Later, through mediation, Liu was returned. Unexpectedly, she fled again on August 23rd of the lunar calendar and disappeared without a trace. At that time, he still suspected that Zou had taken her away. On the 28th of last month, a friend surnamed Xu of Zou's came and told him that his wife was not taken by someone surnamed Zou, but was hidden by his colleague Yu Tianxiang. He asked him to discuss a solution at Zou's school. Later, when he went to Zou's school, Zou told him that Yu had a friend named Guan Shude. He could ask Guan to lure Yu out and kill him to avenge this. He immediately returned to the corps and explained the situation to Guan. At 11 p.m. on the 30th of last month, he called Guan to the corps and had Yu called out. He had been lying in ambush beforehand in the wilderness beside the Xiaochebang River near Zhangjiazhai, holding Guan's rifle, number 292. He shot and killed Yu. The bullet entered from the front chest and exited from the back. After Yu fell from the shot, he and Guan went forward to look at him. Guan then fired another shot at Yu and stabbed him three times with a sharp knife, one stab to the head and two stabs to the waist and back. Then Guan snatched the deceased's pistol and sent it to his guarantor, Zou Guoguang. Later, he thought that the revenge had been taken, so he returned to the post to sleep. Around 4 p.m. the next afternoon, members of the team came and arrested him at the tiger stove. Zou Guoguang confessed that he is 35 years old, from the same hometown as Zhu, and lives in the Public Works Bureau school on Sichuan Road as a "guan dou" (a type of police officer). At 12:40 a.m. on the 30th of September, Zhu Shaofu rang the doorbell. He initially suspected it was someone from Sandao Tou coming to sign a document, but when he opened the door, it was Zhu Shaofu. Zhu took out a pistol, number 21545, with three bullets, and put it there, saying Tian would take it. At that time, he saw blood on Zhu's undershirt and asked him where it came from. Zhu told him that Yu Tianxiang had just been killed. Upon hearing this, he immediately went to Zhangjiazhai with Zhu. He looked at the deceased's side and heard someone in the defense post say that the deceased had a pistol. Later, he returned to the school and sent the pistol to Yang Yucai. Detective Yang reported to the Deputy Captains Bao Ziying and Shi Zuhan, who dispatched the Deputy Squad Leaders Liu Changpei and Li Zhuqing, along with Yang Yucai, Sun Youzhi, Zang Ding, and Gao Changgui, and him to Zhangjiazhai, where they arrested Zhu Shaofu. They then dug up a rifle bullet and a sharp knife from the mud where the deceased had fallen and presented them as evidence. However, Guan Shude had already fled. After the team took the confession, yesterday they had already transported the suspect Zhu Shaofu, the reporter Zou Guoguang, along with a pistol, a sharp knife, three bullets, and one bullet head, to the Xinzha Sub-bureau. It was also heard that Zhu Shaofu said that his wife was taken away by Zou, which was a slander.</p>
<h3>Yongtai Cigarette Factory Accused of Evading Taxes of Over 20,000 Gold Coins; 63 Account Books Were Not Stamped; The Factory Manager Failed to Appear in Court Yesterday After Being Summoned</h3>
<p>The cigars sold by the Yongtai Cigarette Factory's distribution office at 326 Henan Road have not been taxed. After the General Inspectorate learned of this, it reported it to the First Special District Court. After dispatching detectives to the office for investigation the other day, it was discovered that from February of the 22nd year of the Republic [1933] to the end of last year, 6,289,681 cigars made by the factory had been sold, none of which had been taxed according to regulations. In addition, it was found that as many as 63 of the office's account books were not stamped, causing the state to lose 26,969.62 yuan in cigarette taxes, and the stamp tax also suffered considerable losses. Yesterday morning, the First Special Court summoned Zheng Qinyu, the factory manager from Zhongshan, Guangdong, for questioning, but Zheng refused to appear again and sent lawyer Yan Fangang to court to defend him. Public Security Bureau lawyer Jiang Baolian then presented the case, accusing the defendant of violating the Cigarette Tax Regulations and the Stamp Tax Regulations, and requested that he be punished according to law. Lawyer Yan then defended the defendant, saying that the cigars had been taxed by the factory when they were made. After the Yongtai Factory was destroyed in the "January 28th Incident," the cigars are now produced by the Senji Factory, which also pays taxes. Judge Zhan then postponed the hearing.</p>
<h3>A Comprador of Tianli Foreign Firm Was Threatened by Bandits; A Bandit Arrived in a Car to Collect the Money; He Was Arrested by Detectives Who Were Waiting</h3>
<p>Gong Ziqing, a comprador of Tianli Foreign Firm on Beijing Road, from Wuxi, lives at 78 Yayuan Road and runs the Ruidati Tiehang (iron shop) at 376 North Suzhou Road. Between the 25th and 28th of last month, he received two threatening letters from bandits, each containing a bullet, demanding 2,000 yuan. They also notified him by telephone to pay the money, otherwise they would take drastic measures. Gong reported the information to the police and negotiated on the phone. As a result, he agreed to pay 150 yuan, and arranged for someone to come to his house to collect it at 6 p.m. the day before yesterday. Zhou Yushan and Ye Yusi, the Chinese detective chiefs of the Jiashin Road Police Station in charge of the area, and Western detectives disguised themselves and waited near Zheng's house to observe the situation. Zhang Shengsan, a relative, waited with a check for 250 yuan. After a while, Zhang Yunlong, from Chongming, arrived in a Yunfei car number 12284. He got out of the car and calmly entered the house, presented a letter to Zhang Shengsan, obtained the check, and hurriedly left, giving a receipt. The Chinese and Western detectives rushed forward, arrested him, and took him to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Public Works Bureau, detailed the case, saying that the defendant claimed at the police station that the principal offender was surnamed Shen, whom he met in a teahouse on Yuliao Bridge Road in Ximen. Later, he claimed that an old woman living in a thatched house on the same road had contacted him. His words were very hesitant. The threatening letters and receipts were not written by him. It was found that Gong Bingxian, who had previously been an accountant in the iron shop, had resigned for some reason and had been borrowing money from the owner from time to time. Recently, last month, he went to borrow money again but was refused and left in anger. It is possible that this person was responsible. It is recommended that the case be postponed for further investigation. Detective Zhou then reported the process of arresting the defendant and presented the letters and receipts. Gong Ziqing, the owner, was unable to attend due to illness, so his representative, Zhang Shengsan, testified about the situation at the time. Zhu Afu, the driver of the Yunfei car, said that he received a phone call at the branch on Ximen Road, asking him to send a car to the Red House Hospital on the same road. He drove the car to the entrance of the hospital and honked the horn twice. The defendant came from behind the car and said that he was going to Yayuan Road. He had an arrogant attitude. When the car arrived at the entrance of the owner's house, he jumped out and told him to wait a moment, and he went inside. After a while, he came out and was about to get into the car when he was arrested by the Chinese and Western detectives in the police station. The fare had not yet been paid. The defendant claimed that the letters were written by the principal offender, surnamed Shen, and the rest of his testimony was hesitant. Judge Xiao Xiefei ordered him to be detained and postponed the hearing for seven days for further verification.</p>
<h3>Ding Ruichun Does Not Want Her Son to Be a Fatherless Child; Ten Years Ago, She Was a Prostitute and Had a Son with Chen Xianzhang; Now, as the Legal Guardian, She Sues to Confirm His Identity</h3>
<p>Chen Xianzhang once visited Zhangtai ten years ago and formed an inextricable bond with the beautiful Ding Ruichun. The prostitute then gave birth to a son named Peilin and abandoned her life of prostitution, dedicating herself to raising him. Now Peilin is twelve years old and quite intelligent, studying at a primary school in the city. Ding is also over thirty years old. Recently, because her son will soon come of age, but his status as the son of Chen Xianzhang has not been formally established, she feels it is inappropriate. She negotiated with Chen, but Chen resolutely denied it. Ding, as Peilin's legal guardian, hired a lawyer to file a lawsuit against Chen in the First Special District Court to confirm his identity. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ni Zhenghuan held an interrogation. Neither the plaintiff nor the defendant personally appeared in court, but were represented by lawyers. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that the child was born to the defendant and that there was various evidence to prove it. In particular, the child's face greatly resembled the defendant's, which was obvious at a glance. At the next hearing, the plaintiff Ding Ruichun will bring her son to court, requesting that the defendant also personally appear in court, which will not be difficult to identify, and requesting that the father and son be sent to the Zhenru Forensic Institute for identification, which would be even clearer. The defendant's lawyer then made a brief defense, and the court then adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3>The Tat Tiger Cart Industry Sends Another Letter to the Public Works Bureau, Requesting That They Order Their Subordinates Not to Detain Carts Without Reason</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Tat Cart Industry Mutual Aid Association sent a letter to the Public Works Bureau yesterday, stating: "We respectfully inform you that members of our association have repeatedly reported that recently, various police stations have been detaining tat carts and tiger carts without reason, making it difficult for them to make a living and requesting protection. Our tat cart and tiger cart industry relies on human power to transport goods, working hard to maintain their meager livelihood. In this sluggish market, making a living and staying warm and fed is a constant concern. Those responsible for local security should be protecting their livelihoods. However, the various police stations do not understand this and often detain them without reason, which is inappropriate. We respectfully request that your bureau, as the highest administrative authority in the concession, is always concerned about the livelihoods of laborers. Therefore, we send this letter to request that you instruct your subordinates not to detain tat carts and tiger carts without reason. If a cart owner has done something wrong, please kindly guide them and do not cause them to be alarmed. This is our sincere prayer."</p>

<h3>Creditors Lost Over 200,000 After Yongyuan Company Went Bankrupt; Tong Jitong Sues Shen Renqing for Joint Fraud for Defrauding Goods with Bad Checks</h3>
<p>The general manager of Yongyuan Trading Company at 7 Yong'an Street, French Concession, was Jiang Tingfu from Ningbo. This year, he successively ordered a large batch of goods from major factories with postdated checks, which were transported to other ports for sale. On September 8, the company suddenly went bankrupt, and Jiang fled with the money without a trace. The total amount owed to the victims reached over 200,000 yuan. The creditors jointly organized a creditor group to recover the debt. At the same time, Tong Jitong, the manager of Zhufeng Company, filed a criminal self-accusation in the Second Special Court against Jiang Tingfu, the general manager of the company, and Shen Renqing, the manager from Hangzhou, for joint fraud, and filed an accompanying civil lawsuit. On the 18th of last month, the Municipal Public Security Bureau arrested Shen Renqing and transferred him to the local court for detention. Yesterday morning, the Second Special Court ordered the police to transfer Shen to the court for trial. The plaintiff, Tong Jitong, stated that Shen Renqing was introduced to purchase goods by a salesman, Gao Yangwu. After paying with a postdated check, he purchased a large amount of goods and then stopped shipping them. According to Shen, a telegram came from Guangdong, and he still needed to continue purchasing. On July 26, Gao suddenly disappeared for no reason. The company only owed more than 100 yuan, and only after pursuing the guarantor was it paid off. It was clear that the salesman colluded. On July 9, the company added goods and paid with a check for over 2,000 yuan, which was postponed repeatedly until the 4th. When a member of the company went to collect it when it was due, Shen suddenly said to come back in ten days. On the 8th, the company declared bankruptcy. The salary book showed that Jiang's salary was 181 yuan, Shen's was 151 yuan, and the rest of the staff only received 40 or 50 yuan. It was clear that Shen was the manager of the company, and there was documentary evidence to prove it. Shen Renqing stated that he was only a small employee of the company and had no involvement in the fraud. He had also been defrauded of a large sum of money and was also a creditor. He requested the court to arrest Jiang Tingfu. Judge Qiu verified the confession and ordered that the hearing be continued at 12 a.m. on the 12th and that the defendant be returned to custody. He also instructed Tong Jitong to present clear evidence that Shen was the manager. At this point, Judge Qiu re-examined Shen Renqing's self-accusation of Jiang Tingfu's fraud. Because Jiang had not been arrested, there was no way to try the case. He told Shen that the case could only be tried after the previous case was clarified or Jiang was arrested, and ordered the bailiffs to take Shen down and return him to custody.</p>

<h3>Yao Amei's Corpse to Be Exhumed for Re-examination</h3>
<p>Family Insists Boat Owner Beaten to Death; Boat Owner Suffers and Files Complaint with the Court</p>
<p>After Gong Haigen, a kiln cargo boat owner, had an argument with his hired boatman Yao Amei on the 19th of last month, Yao Amei fell into the river and died. The next day, the body was recovered, and the village head Zhao Ketang reported it to the local court for inspection. Prosecutor Xiao Jinying and others, commissioned by the court, arrived at the scene and determined that Yao Amei had indeed fallen into the river and died, filling out the form and ordering the coffin to be buried. It is now known that the family members of the deceased did not put the coffin lid on and repeatedly negotiated with the boat owner Gong Haigen, insisting that he had been beaten to death. Gong, unable to bear the burden, filed a complaint with the court requesting a thorough investigation. The wording of his complaint was roughly as follows: "Haigen owns a kiln cargo boat, which is docked in the Yangsi Port River. At 4:00 p.m. on September 19, the boatman Yao Amei suddenly lost his footing and drowned. His brother Yao Yinhai was on the boat (also a boatman) and immediately reported to the third squadron of the Yangsi Port Water Patrol, who ordered a quick rescue and reported all the people to the Public Security Bureau. Yao Yinhai confessed that his brother had indeed lost his footing and fallen into the water. According to witness Zhao Chengsheng, who testified that he witnessed the deceased losing his footing. Haigen was not at the scene when the accident occurred. After your court inspected the body, you ordered the coffin to be buried. Unexpectedly, many family members of the deceased came out, prevented the coffin from being covered, and destroyed the civilian's belongings. It was also heard that the family members of the deceased, in the quiet of the night, personally broke one of the deceased's feet and would try to deceive your court again, requesting another examination in order to blame the innocent. Left with no other choice, I file this complaint requesting a strict investigation." After the court received the complaint, yesterday morning it sent the police across the river to escort the coffin of Yao Amei, along with the family members of the deceased and the village head of the district, to the court. At 2:00 p.m., the coffin was transported by the Zhenru Forensic Institute's hearse to the Zhenru Institute, where it was opened for re-examination. If necessary, an autopsy will be performed.</p>

<p>Western Alliance Manpower Scattered and Loses Badly 9-18. 200-Meter Relay Breaks National Record.</p>
<p>The swimming competition between the Hong Kong-Shanghai Chinese Alliance and the Shanghai Western Alliance was held again last night at the city swimming pool. The Chinese Alliance defeated the Western Alliance by a large margin with a score of 18-9. The score difference was exactly one-fold. The Western Alliance easily lost because of its incomplete manpower and the fact that all of its members were second-rate athletes. The women's group lacked Western women entirely, so Yang Xiuqiong and others had to perform alone. The water polo match, where interest was concentrated, was won by the Chinese Alliance by a score of 4-1. Jening and Brunnet's comical diving performance was humorous and elicited applause and laughter from the two thousand spectators, making it an interesting highlight of the competition. The number of spectators last night exceeded that of the previous night.</p>
<p>Fifty Meters Lost Unfortunately</p>
<p>The 50-meter freestyle was one of the most exciting scenes in the competition. Western Alliance's Britten was a Shanghai Interport athlete this year and was narrowly defeated by Chen Zhenxing in Hong Kong. He was quite unwilling to accept this. The two met again last night and competed with all their might. Unfortunately, Zhenxing was a little late falling into the water, and the distance was too short. Britten defeated him by a shoulder's length at the finish line, which was a pity.</p>
<p>100 Meters Breaks Record</p>
<p>Chen Zhenxing, who finished second in the 50-meter event, showed his skills in the 100-meter freestyle. Western Alliance's Stankowski was able to resist stubbornly. At 80 meters, he was neck and neck with Chen Zhenxing, indistinguishable. It was not until the last 15 meters that Chen jumped ahead, finally defeating Stankowski by a distance of three meters. Li Luomin was third, and Liang Xingsheng was absent. According to the record, Chen's time was 1 minute 6.7 seconds, only one-tenth of a second behind the national record of 1 minute 6.6 seconds.</p>
<p>Chinese Alliance Sweeps Backstroke and Breaststroke</p>
<p>The Chinese Alliance swept the 100-meter backstroke and 100-meter breaststroke. Only one Westerner, Ryan, participated in the breaststroke, and one, Belins, participated in the backstroke. As a result, both of them were completely defeated, being third-rate athletes in the Western Alliance.</p>
<p>Women's Competition Changed to Performance</p>
<p>The women's competition was temporarily changed to a performance competition due to the absence of Western women. Yang Xiuqiong, Yang Xiuzhen, and Chen Fengying first performed the 50-meter freestyle, with Xiuqiong first, Xiuzhen second, and Chen third. The time was 36.7 seconds, better than Yang's national record of 38.2 seconds, but not as good as the 36-second record from the previous night. Next, Yang Xiuqiong performed the 100-meter backstroke alone, without timing. Qu Enzhao also performed the 200-meter breaststroke alone. Because there was no competition, the time was 3 minutes 49 seconds. Qu is only 13 years old and broke the national record for the 200-meter breaststroke in Hong Kong with a time of 3 minutes 35 seconds. Qu is one of the promising talents in the National Games.</p>
<p>Diving Performance is Comical and Humorous</p>
<p>The diving performance first featured artistic diving, with participants Henbo, Glick, Belins, Huang Xiying, and Zha Zhurui. The Westerners are all experts in this field, not only are their poses beautiful, but also their patterns are varied. Huang Xihan is also comparable, but slightly inferior. Next, Jening and Brunnet performed comical diving, dressed as clowns, performing various comical falls into the water on the diving board, eliciting laughter and applause from the audience. The two are not only humorous, but also have good diving skills.</p>
<p>Relay Lost But Results are Remarkable</p>
<p>The lineup of the 200-meter relay was as follows: (1) Xu Heng, (2) Zeng Hefu, (3) Li Luomin, (4) Chen Zhenxing. The first two were neck and neck with the Westerners. Unfortunately, Li Luomin was a little late falling into the water, so the fourth person, Chen Zhenxing, could not catch up. They lost to Britten by five meters. The Chinese Alliance's time was 1 minute 58.6 seconds, which, although second, broke the national record of 2 minutes 1.1 seconds. The Western Alliance's time was 1 minute 57.6 seconds, a difference of one second.</p>
<p>Water Polo Match Won by Chinese Alliance</p>
<p>In the final water polo match, the Chinese Alliance won 4-2. Their coordination was extremely skilled, and their shooting was also good. It is said that the Western Alliance's participants were the B team of the Asian Youth Water Polo team, with no coordination at all. Their strength was too far apart from that of the Chinese Alliance. In the first half, the Chinese Alliance quickly scored three goals. In the second half, the Western Alliance scored one goal, and the Chinese Alliance also scored. The Western Alliance scored another goal, resulting in a score of 4-2. The Chinese Alliance lineup was as follows:</p>
<p>Zhou Dayun</p>
<p>Chen Ziqing Zhang Yunguang Zeng Hefu</p>
<p>Zhou Ruiqin Li Luomin Xu Heng</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Province Athlete Lineup</h3>
<p>Men's and Women's High Jump Results are Very Outstanding. Swimming Team Goes to Jiangsu and Zhejiang for Friendly Matches.</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence - Jiangxi's participation in previous National Games has resulted in very few points, and even zero points in some cases. In recent years, the authorities have paid considerable attention to sports and are rapidly catching up. In particular, President Chiang's stationing in Jiangxi to suppress bandits has made sports one of the key elements of national revival, promoting and urging it without reservation. Sports fields have been added in various counties and cities throughout the province, and swimming, archery, and equestrianism have emerged in response to the trend, becoming popular everywhere. Sports are no longer limited to students, and soldiers, civil servants, and citizens also participate. The selection of representatives for this year's Games, which leans towards bank and agency staff, soldiers, and freelancers, is a clear indication of this.</p>
<p>Jiangxi's participation in the 6th National Games began on September 11th, with competitions and selections organized by county and city. All athletes were then trained and tested. All staff members were also appointed by the Department of Education.</p>
<p>Staff</p>
<p>Provincial Representative (Department of Education, He Jianqian, General Leader, Public Stadium Director) Yu Yongzuo, Deputy Leaders Xing Lufel, Deng Beishun, General Managers Gong Zhenfan, Shen Rongzhao, Shi Meikui, Men's Track and Field and All-Around Coach Yin Xianmin, Manager Tao Youmei, Basketball Coach Wu Yunlong, Manager Lin Xingfang, Volleyball Coach Chuan Bingyue, Manager Chen Ying, Tennis Coach Chen Shimian, Soccer Coach Yang Demi, Manager Wang Youmin, Traditional Chinese Martial Arts Liang Yaoting, Seawater Swimming Coach Lu Gaohui, Women's Track and Field Coach Li Zonghao, Manager Lu Xunxue, Women's Basketball Coach Wu Qiu, Manager Tao Lihua.</p>
<p>Track and Field</p>
<p>Because of the selection of the elite from the Air Force, various military units, and bank agencies, the strength of the athletes is better than in previous Games. This time, they may be able to wash away the shame of zero points. The lineups are as follows: 100 meters, Liu Jiayu, 11.8 seconds; 400 meters, Xu Jiyun, 57 seconds; 400-meter hurdles, 1 minute 5.7 seconds; middle hurdles, Jin Huaizhi, 1 minute 4.3 seconds; high jump, Yang Baoluo, 1.83 meters, Zhou Shijian, 1.82 meters; pole vault, Leng Peiji, 3.15 meters; discus, Leng Peiji, 32 meters; javelin, Yang Baoluo, 41.72 meters; triple jump, Huang Bogang, 12.30 meters. On the women's side, the Provincial First Women's Vocational School almost swept the field, with outstanding athletes such as Hu Meixiu's discus at 23.06 meters, Liao Fang's high jump at 1.29 meters, and Cheng Maolan's 16-pound shot put at 8.76 meters. Many of the others broke provincial and Central China records.</p>
<p>Swimming</p>
<p>The province's strength is quite good. The athletes are mostly veterans from the Bolang Team, Lizhi Branch, and New Life Club swimming teams, with well-trained skills. In the recent disaster relief competitions held in Jiangxi with Hunan and Hubei, the top three places were swept by the province. They have now departed for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui to participate in friendly matches, with all proceeds from ticket sales going to disaster relief. Their results are as follows: Bu Liang's 50-meter freestyle, 35 seconds; 100-meter freestyle, 1 minute 26 seconds; Liu Lingci's 100-meter backstroke, 1 minute 42 seconds; Chao Zhikui's 200-foot breaststroke, 3 minutes; Wan Ronggui's 400 meters, 7 minutes 20 seconds; 1500 meters, 29 minutes 52 seconds. Other events such as bound hands and feet swimming, escaping from burlap sacks, and artistic diving also have good results. This time, they will definitely show their skills.</p>
<p>Ball Games</p>
<p>A mixed system is adopted, no longer with representatives from a certain city or county attending. The men's tennis players are Li Yunyan, Wang Yinghuai, Zhu Qinghe, and Mao Linkui. The men's basketball team includes Li Yuelong, Zhang Shao, Meng Yukun, Shen Huanqing, Meng Guangxin, Liu Zongwu, Shi Fen, Fan Zhisui, Li Xihu, and Zhang Xianqiu. The men's volleyball team consists of twelve athletes including Xu Jiepei. The soccer players are Li Peng, Xie Shougeng, Yu Changfu, Wang Shiduo, Yang Xukui, Zhao Zehui, Chen Chao, Chen Zulin, Zeng Wenzhi, Liu Chenghu, Zhao Youmin, Li Jingcai, Zhao Ji, and Tang Yuanhe. The above are mostly elites from various military units, schools, the Aviation Commission Air Force, and amateur athletes. The women's ball games are based on Nanchang Women's Middle School and Women's Vocational Baoling, with outstanding participants from various counties only participating in basketball. The rest were not sent due to a lack of talent. Therefore, this time, they uphold the principle of selecting the best, not the most.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Tennis Association Sponsors Public Tennis Performance</h3>

<h3>Hubei Department of Education Establishes Health Education Division</h3>
<p>(Hankou, 1st) - In order to promote the implementation of health education in schools throughout the province, the Hubei Department of Education has specially established a Health Education Division, with Xu Shouchu as the director, which was officially established on October 1st.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Municipal Council Education Department Pays Attention to the Future of Students</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Council Education Department recently held a meeting to discuss two important matters: one was the eyesight of students. The head of the Municipal Council Health Department had submitted a detailed report on the poor eyesight of students in the various Chinese schools established by the Municipal Council, arguing that the parents of the students should be vigorously educated to promote their awareness. The trachoma treatment that has been effective is also accompanied by the treatment of other eye diseases. In the future, full attention should be paid to the treatment of trachoma first, and ordinary eyesight treatment will be considered at a later date. According to the report of the school medical director of the Municipal Council, Chinese students' parents have a deep prejudice against children wearing glasses. The remedy is to issue notices and persuasion, but there is no good method. Students from poor families often cannot afford to buy glasses, and ordinary families still consider glasses a luxury item and not a necessity for children. Therefore, the Education Department's discussion of the eyesight problem of students argued that it should continue to work with the Health Department. Furthermore, the Education Department also discussed the outlets for out-of-school children and the supervision of students after school. The Education Department had previously commissioned Mr. Harris to investigate the facilities in London, England, for this matter. Mr. Harris's report has been submitted to the Education Department. During the last meeting, it was said that only the outlet of students could be tried in Shanghai, but the scope was too broad, and it was doubtful whether the Education Department's strength could be competent and happy. However, it seemed that the Chinese education authorities were working hard, and the development of vocational education and the introduction of institutional services were both major initiatives. If the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession could urge the existing institutions in the Concession to carry out these initiatives, it could achieve twice the result with half the effort. It was then resolved that the Education Department Director should prepare a report on the vocational guidance facilities in the Chinese and Western schools and discuss it in the long run. The above record of the Education Department meeting has been read by the Board of Directors yesterday.</p>
<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Solicits Privately Written Children's Books</h3>
<p>To Participate in the National Children's Goods Exhibition</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Education issued a public notice stating that it had received a letter from the National Children's Year Implementation Committee (Order No. 176), which stated that the committee, in accordance with the provisions of the General Outline of the Children's Year Implementation Measures, would hold a National Children's Books Exhibition in December of this year. Among the committee's measures regarding the collection of exhibits, there was a category of privately written children's books. The collection of these books was decided by the committee's fifth congress as follows: (1) Request the local Children's Year Implementation Committees and provincial and municipal education departments to collect on its behalf. (2) Advertise in newspapers to solicit from private individuals, recorded on file. A corresponding record letter is hereby sent for your reference and processing, and please send the books collected on its behalf to the committee before November for display and exhibition. In addition to informing all subordinate schools and institutions to widely solicit, this public notice is hereby issued to inform all. All privately written children's books must be submitted to the Bureau before the end of October for verification and approval.</p>

<h3>Little Boy (64)</h3>
<p>— Original by Ms. Alcott of America, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>At that time, Frank was still studying. When he finished leaving the study room, he smelled smoke. He rushed upstairs and saw this scene, rising like a cloud from the left wing of the house. He felt there was no time to wake others, so he immediately ran into the room and dragged the two children out of the blazing bed, pouring all the water he could find onto the flames. The fire subsided slightly, but it didn't go out completely. The two children, dragged to the cold hallway, had already regained consciousness and began to scream frantically. Mrs. Pei arrived on the scene immediately. Soon, Mr. Lai rushed out of his room, shouting "Fire!" His voice startled the entire house. A group of little white-clad spirits, looking frightened, gathered in the doorway. For a moment, everyone seemed to be overwhelmed by fear, not knowing what to do.</p>
<p>Soon, Mrs. Pei was the first to regain her alertness. She ordered Nasui to take care of the burned children, and told Frank and Mr. Lai to bring several buckets of wet clothes from downstairs. She immediately threw these wet clothes onto the bed, carpet, and curtains, because these were now burning fiercely and about to spread to all four walls.</p>
<p>Most of the children just stood there watching, only Tang En and Ai Mi bravely rushed to the bathroom to get water, and helped pull down the dangerous curtains.</p>

<h3>The National Products Industry Should Take a Long-Term View</h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Today, the national products industry should rely on its own efforts to open up new avenues and compete with global industry and commerce, so as not to be subject to natural elimination. It must not be confined to the mainland, engaging solely in imitation, echoing others, and thus falling into a dead end. For example, regarding the matter of exhibitions, the reporter has repeatedly offered earnest advice, suggesting that organizers should change course as early as possible and explore new paths. However, the general public is blinded by small profits and driven by a desire to win, holding one exhibition after another, continuously. Disregarding the opposition of local merchants and the rejection of local groups, they are seen as bandits, only creating resentment among local merchants who are enthusiastic about selling national products. They brazenly ignore this, what kind of plan is this that things would get to this point? I have often said that if national product exhibitions are not improved, the national products exhibited in the future will become annoying to various places, and merchants in various places may be unwilling to sell national products. The organizers of these events, using various factories to increase their own importance, rely on the reputation of tax exemption to engage in sales, without considering that local vendors are not unpatriotic, they already have the same products, and usually sell them to local users. Now the organizers, disregarding the meaning of the name, use the name of exhibitions to carry out dumping. Selling the same products at different prices, they may benefit themselves, but what about the local merchants? Therefore, I have often advised national product merchants that instead of joining exhibitions and creating resentment among merchants in various places, it is better to send staff to various places to investigate and liaise, listen to the opinions of merchants and the psychology of customers in various places, in order to gain general goodwill and criticism, so as to improve their own products. Being fond of pursuing and joining the fun, only to lose customers in various places, is not only useless, but also harmful. I sincerely advise you, please forgive my bluntness. Furthermore, today the national products industry should take a long-term view and pay attention to international trade. To curb import surplus, we must first encourage exports. The Nanyang area is a huge outlet for our country's national products industry. Currently, the Ministry of Industry and the International Trade Bureau, and the China Industrial Foreign Trade Association are working hard to support national product manufacturers and promote national products. Recently, Mr. Zhang Yujiu, the new secretary-general of the International Trade Association, is the most enthusiastic comrade for national products. The reporter knows that he is very willing to serve the national products industry. Our national products industry should cooperate with him earnestly. When there are various issues, we can discuss them with him and surely achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<h3>Heartfelt Words from Leading Figures in the National Products Industry</h3>
<p>— Kang Jianzhai's Wife</p>
<p>The other day, I happened to see in the Xin Ye Bao a conversation in which Huang Jiping interviewed several leading figures in the Shanghai industrial sector. These leading figures, who are working hard to promote national products, seem to be front-line generals who are firmly entrenched in our country's external economic front, fighting to the death. The words they spoke were bitter and piercing to the heart. Here, I will repeat their words, despite being accused of rehashing old news, and reveal them to everyone as a wake-up call.</p>
<p>"...Speaking of woollen cloth, our country is really losing a lot. Many young people who wear suits, especially college students, despise domestic woollen cloth. They insist on wearing foreign goods. Alas! What Student National Products Year, the future is really unimaginable." - (Words of Mr. Liu Hongsheng)</p>
<p>"...If you close your eyes and smoke various Chinese and foreign cigarettes, you can't tell which is superior or inferior. The taste is not much different either. So I think people who like to smoke foreign cigarettes have no other purpose than to show off their wealth." - (Words of Mr. Wu Yun Chu)</p>
<p>"The Mainland Department Store and China National Products Company have everything, but they don't go in, they want to drill into the three major companies to buy foreign goods. What can you do? Try visiting government agencies and noble families, and the cigarettes and alcohol they have are often foreign goods. It seems that only in this way can they show off their wealth..." - (Words of Mr. Fang Yexian)</p>
<p>"...The sales of light bulbs are worse year by year. The main reason is that the market is shrinking. Like the loss of the Northeast, national products have disappeared. The current North China is like the Northeast; in short, once the situation changes, national products will lose their livelihood..." - (Words of Mr. Hu Xiyuan)</p>
<p>"...Promoting national products has been effective among people in the lower and middle classes. Only the upper class, they have the money, as long as they eat comfortably, they don't care whether it's foreign or domestic. Such inferior mentality is seen in the upper class, which is really disheartening..." - (Words of Mr. Wang Xingyao)</p>
<p>"Japanese people are ashamed of smoking foreign cigarettes and using foreign goods; Chinese people are proud of smoking foreign cigarettes and using foreign goods..." - (Words of Mr. Pan Yangyao)</p>
<p>Currently, tensions are running high between Europe and Africa, and war is imminent. According to the declaration of the Shanghai Banking Research Department, after the outbreak of war, our country's native products transported to European countries and North Africa, such as peanuts, tea, beans, eggs, silk, carpets, and straw mats, will have their sales greatly reduced due to the obstruction of transportation in the Mediterranean Sea. If the war lasts for a year, the export value will decrease by more than 70 million yuan. As for the impact of the war on the situation in East Asia, that is another matter.</p>
<p>We are so far behind in the military preparations for modern warfare that we cannot defend ourselves. The economic war, which is increasingly encroaching, has long been mired in chaos. If we don't try our best to use national products for the necessities of daily life, then we are steadily heading towards the path of destruction!</p>
<p>I know that most newspaper readers, in addition to looking at the dynamics of the international and domestic situation, all kinds of surprising social news, entertaining short articles, movie magazines, and picture magazines, rarely pay attention to propaganda articles that are didactic and not sensational. Especially the so-called rich and noble upper class, and the trendy young people, they themselves do not care, and the words of others' advice cannot enter their ears. Then what else is there to say!</p>
<h3>The Past and Future of Student National Products Year</h3>
<p>— Zhu Weixuan</p>
<p>Oh, how grand and prosperous was the Student National Products Year! In the blink of an eye, two-thirds of it has passed, but when we look back at the achievements of the past, it is really somewhat disheartening. Students, not only have they not achieved significant results or made substantial contributions in this Student National Products Year, but also contradictory, lazy, and distorted situations are constantly unfolding before us. This is truly not only a stain on the Student National Products Year, but also a great shame for the entire Chinese nation!</p>
<p>As for the most contradictory point of the Student National Products Year, nothing is more contradictory than the Western suits and leather shoes of college students, entering and leaving dance halls, opening champagne, eating Western food, chewing Wrigley's gum, and applying Stetson hair cream, none of which are not completely authentic imported goods. Although in a certain period in the past, some people advocated banning college students from dancing, but times have changed, and now college students are once again active in dance halls!</p>
<p>Middle school students have always been very diligent and willing to work hard in social group activities; but in this Student National Products Year, there seems to be no special achievements either. Perhaps because college students are going against the grain, completely forgetting the important mission of the Student National Products Year? So they also follow suit, abandoning their responsibilities. For the national products movement, not only have they not actively developed and promoted it externally; but most of their own desks are still filled with Waterman's ink, and they have Parker fountain pens inserted in their chests, completely placing the arduous responsibility of the Student National Products Year behind their minds!</p>
<p>As for elementary school students, if their parents and teachers do not constantly instill national products education in them, then they probably don't understand the meaning of the so-called Student National Products Year at all. We can often see kindergarten students excitedly playing with foreign toys. This cannot help but make me sigh three times and put down my pen!</p>
<p>The past is gone, the future can be pursued. The constant appearance of these many distorted events in the past certainly makes us feel heartbroken and sigh; but this is definitely not the passive sigh that can help matters. We want to hope for the future; in the next three or four months, we want to redeem our past numb and indifferent sins with real and powerful achievements!</p>
<p>Students across the country! The future masters of the country, you are educated intellectuals, you should stand on the position of the foreknowers and the foresighted. From now on, not only should you set an example by using national products everywhere; but also persuade your family members and even anyone in society to recognize and use national products. At the same time, you should constantly and always instill national products education and common sense in elementary school students, so that the impression of national products will be deeply imprinted in their young minds, and they will develop the habit of using national products from an early age!</p>
<p>Finally, there is one more point that is worth bringing up for discussion: that is, the yearbooks and graduation albums published by major middle schools every year are mostly gold-plated on the cover and beautifully bound. When examining the paper, it all comes from foreign countries. Not only is the profit outflowing every year, which is considerable, but also in the current Student National Products Year, it is extremely contradictory that the booklets, which include the essence of the entire school, are printed on non-national products paper. Once it is passed into the hands of foreigners, it will be ridiculed even more! Therefore, I also hope that those in charge will consider and pay attention to this point before printing, and do not just pursue the beauty of the form and appearance, but disregard the value of the publication itself, leaving a great stain!</p>
<h3>We Need National Product Pen Nibs</h3>
<p>— Ji Yu</p>
<p>To study science, we cannot only rely on a writing brush. Precisely for this reason, pen nibs have formed a very good market for us. We cannot watch box after box of pen nibs coming in and batches of silver going out, so we must shout, "We need national product pen nibs"!</p>
<p>Those who hear it may say: "You know how to use foreign pen nibs, aren't the Chinese fountain pens very good? Look! This is Huafu, this is Xinmin, this is Doctor..." But this friend's words are too "freehand". Fountain pens, even if they are Chinese fountain pens, how much does a pen cost? In this time when five hundred mu of money can only afford one person to study, who has extra money to buy fountain pens? We cannot afford fountain pens, but we need pen nibs.</p>
<p>Here, let me offer some suggestions so that we have good national product pen nibs to use.</p>
<p>(1) The government or merchants should set up factories to manufacture them. For now, let's start with middle school students and go up to college students, not counting others. We know that there are currently 553,414 middle and college students in China. If each person uses one per month, one dozen per year, then the sales of pen nibs will be these 500,000+ dozens. In this large number, if the government or merchants are willing to set up a factory to manufacture them, then even if they adhere to the principle of small profits, I think the benefits will certainly be many. Moreover, the people who use pen nibs are not only students, and in addition to pen nibs, the factory can also produce things such as pen holders, etc.</p>
<p>(2) Fountain pen factories can also produce pen nibs, which is also a very good method, because the nib of a fountain pen and the nib of an ordinary pen are not much different in form. If fountain pen factories are willing to use a part of the mechanical force, and slightly modify the machines to manufacture ordinary pen nibs, then the capital used to modify the machines, which is very little money, can definitely get many rewards.</p>
<p>I hope that the above methods, (1) or (2), can be realized in the shortest possible time. Pen nibs are small, but we must not ignore them. We must know that their leakage is very large.</p>
<h3>Reminiscences of Moon Viewing at Nanhu Lake and Promoting National Products</h3>
<p>— Sun Choucheng</p>
<p>The manuscript "Talking about Cotton Flannel Shirts at Nanhu Lake" by Tianran Jun in this journal cannot help but remind me of the humorous history of buying cold-weather clothing in the vicinity of Yuanyang Lake, where I was compelled to do so by the Wind Aunt and Rain Master. It concerns the promotion of national products, therefore I will record the events of that day in this journal, which I trust is what fellow comrades who are enthusiastic about promoting national products also wish to hear. This year, the Yousheng Travel Group initiated a moon viewing at Nanhu Lake. After the evening banquet at the Yanyu Tower, there were more than 300 participants. My colleagues Sun Mingqi and his wife from the National Association of Pharmaceutical Industry Trade Unions were both among them. Mr. Sun sent me a train ticket because I am originally from Jiaxing, and am more familiar with the famous sights of Hezhong, inviting me to go with him. The kindness of a friend is weighty, and difficult to refuse, so at 7:00 a.m. that morning I went to the station. After the wheel started, I saw Ren Shigang, the manager of the Wuhe Weaving Factory, Fang Jiange, the manager of the Zhonghua Enamel Factory, and Xu Yangnan, the manager of the Hongxin Cloth Factory, and their wives, all there. After exchanging greetings, Mr. Fang said that Mr. Pan Yangyao had originally intended to come, but was unable to do so due to business, so his daughter, Ms. Shi Quan, represented him. He pointed to Ms. Pan and introduced her to me. After a brief chat, I learned that she was working at the Four Banks Savings Society. Her demeanor was generous, and her words were elegant, which showed that she came from a family with a long academic tradition, different from the rest. A tiger father does not beget a dog son, truly. After arriving in He, we first visited the Railway Nursery, where many chrysanthemums were planted, but unfortunately it was too early and none of them were in bloom. Then we went to the Dongta Temple to pay respects to the tomb of Zhu Maichen. There were few cars and many people, and the Jiao Li Street was suddenly crowded. The tomb is located north of the tower, behind my old house. In the midst of overgrown weeds and desolate smoke, there is a stone tablet standing upright. People all stepped through the weeds to gaze at it, all saying that if there were no Peking opera of "Water Splashed Before the Horse," the public would not value this person so much. Therefore, his fame was actually created by his wife, Cui. At 11:00 a.m., we boarded a boat to the Yanyu Tower, some went to the Baomei Pavilion to appreciate the plums painted by Peng Gangzhi, and others went to the Leizu Temple to visit the images of Guanshiyin, etc. After lunch, we went to the Three Pagodas to see the Blood Imprint Monk. Midway, the wind and rain mingled, and the weather suddenly turned cold. Upon arriving at the Chachan Temple, everyone showed signs of shivering. After I told them that the Blood Imprint Monk was a resident monk of the Chachan Temple, named Miaodi, and that during the Jiajing period of the Ming Dynasty, the Japanese pirates occupied the Southeast, took women and children hostage, and detained them in this temple. Miaodi heard the crying and was moved by the thought of Bodhi. He got the guards drunk and released them all. After the guards woke up, they hated him to the bone, tied him to the stone archway, and burned him to death with piled firewood, and the shadow appeared. It has been hundreds of years now, and it has not receded. In the 15th year of the Republic of China, when Wei Daofeng was the magistrate of Jiaxing, he admired his loyalty and righteousness, and specially erected a monument to praise him. After the facts, the public was suddenly enlightened. Because it concerned national character, everyone showed a righteous face, as if they were wrapped in cotton, and did not feel cold. At 3:00 p.m., we went around the West City to the Shanqing Gate. The weather was even colder. Approaching the city, everyone went to Tangwan Street to buy cotton flannel shirts to resist the cold. I told my fellow boaters that the market was full of foreign goods, and that they should pay special attention to this. Among domestic products, the Goose brand of Wuhe is the most famous and can be tried. Everyone agreed. After buying them, all the shirts were printed with a goose. I turned to Mr. Wang and said, "If your ancestor Mr. Yi Zhi was here today, I wonder how he would dance and stomp for this kind of Goose brand cotton flannel shirt." Everyone laughed heartily. At the evening banquet at the Yanyu Tower, Chang'e hid and did not come out, and the Rain Master and Wind Aunt still displayed their power, causing the silk sleeves to feel cold. Fortunately, we relied on this cotton flannel shirt to resist, otherwise it would have been difficult to support. Therefore, there was much goodwill towards the Wuhe Weaving Factory. Mr. Ren and his wife smiled. Some people who did not manage to buy cotton flannel shirts used the towels of the Sanyou Industrial Society as scarves.</p>

<p>New National Product Oilcloth (Double Hammer Brand)</p>
<p>Architect Mr. Cao Kedong, a native of Shanghai, is dedicated to studying architecture. In the early years of the Republic of China, he was employed by the Tianjin French Engineering Bureau, where he served for nearly 20 years. Most of the famous buildings in major cities in North China rely on his planning. Mr. Cao is especially fond of studying building materials, such as organizing the Yudong Brick and Tile Company and the Kaiming Electric Company, and has achieved remarkable results. Recently, in the building materials, oilcloth is a product that has no domestic output, and all of them need to use foreign goods. The outflow of money is a pity! He has carefully studied its raw materials and ingredients, and has built his own special oilcloth machine without borrowing external force. After more than three years of painstaking research, he organized the Jianhua Oilcloth Company last summer and manufactured several types of fully national product oilcloth with the double hammer brand. All provinces in North China have already adopted it. They all believe that the quality is excellent and can surpass imported products, and the pricing is extremely low. It has now been registered and filed with the Ministry of Industry and has been granted trademark exclusive rights. This time, in response to the exhibition of national product building materials, there are many samples for the reference of major architects, in order to promote national products and regain rights.</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Tianxu Wosheng)</p>
<p>Don't complain about the heat. If you compare yourself with the people who farm the land, you will feel calm and realize that you are really too impatient.</p>
<p>A minister's heart is like water. Comparing the heart to water is the most appropriate. It is better for the heart to be cold than hot, because when it gets close to the boiling point, it will be tormented and gasified, until it is scorched and dried. If you don't want it to be tormented, it is also very easy. Just take it away from the fire and it will cool down.</p>
<p>The coldness and heat of the human heart are the same as the coldness and heat of water. There is less due to heaven and more due to man. Throughout the year, it is really rare for it to be hot to C氏38 degrees and cold to 0 degrees. As the saying goes, the great cold does not last more than three days, and the great heat does not last more than three days, which shows that among the 365 days of the year, there are only these six days. It can be said that it is extremely rare. However, human power can overcome heaven. He uses coal fire to torment, and sucks with air to force, and can immediately make water gasified into the ocean. Isn't this man-made?</p>
<p>Those who have the thought of starting hotness are mostly people who are full and warm and are not satisfied. If you make that person feel the oppression of hunger and cold, and seek to avoid freezing and starvation, he will run and shout under the scorching sun. Even if he sweats profusely and feels like he's burning inside, he will never want to resist this annoyance with lightning, wind, and cold air.</p>
<h3>Military Food for Italian Troops Stationed in Africa</h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>Amidst the tense atmosphere of preparing to kick off the Italo-Abyssinian War, two types of merchants are making a fortune. The first type making a big fortune is the arms dealer, the second type making a small fortune is the water and vegetable merchant. The arms dealer's big customer is Abyssinia, and the water and vegetable merchant's big customer is Italy. Abyssinia cannot manufacture arms themselves, so they must procure them from abroad. The arms dealers have already calculated this big business and cannot escape it. But the transaction of water and vegetables for Italy, the water and vegetable merchants had not expected, it really is "extra money" business. Italy procured a large number of lemons and oranges, and transported them to the Italian colonies in Eritrea and Somaliland, to be used as provisions for the troops stationed in Africa.</p>
<p>Italian soldiers stationed in Somaliland are given three oranges or lemons per person per day, but Italian soldiers in Eritrea are given one serving of this fruit every two days. Because the terrain of Eritrea is higher than that of Somaliland, and the climate is more suitable for hygiene, the need for water and vegetables is relatively small, so the amount of fruit in the military food is slightly reduced. This fruit is very beneficial to the health of troops in tropical areas; especially lemons, which are extremely necessary, are an indispensable savior in the epidemic of typhoid fever.</p>
<p>In addition to fruit, each person is also given one and a half pounds of bread, six to nine ounces of meat, six ounces of macaroni, three and a half ounces of potatoes, two ounces of vegetables, and one ounce of tobacco per day. Twice a week, macaroni is replaced with the same amount of rice. In addition, the army also supplies a small amount of seasoning, oil, cheese, and one and a half ounces of jam every day. Italian soldiers in Eritrea are also given half an ounce of coffee and three-quarters of an ounce of sugar per day; Italian soldiers in Somaliland are given twice as much per day.</p>
<h3>Long Rainbow Studio Painting Notes</h3>
<p>— Zheng Yimei</p>
<p>Master Shanfu Shengtan said: "After dancing, one wants to soak in the reeds and play the flute, but the hands tremble severely; after playing loud brass instruments, one wants to play the serene xiao flute, but the ears ring terribly; after galloping on horseback, one wants to enter the ranks and dance, but one is severely out of breath; after scolding the audience, one wants to chant Buddhist hymns, but one's throat is terribly dry." Unexpectedly, what the ancients found difficult, modern people can handle with ease, as if it were nothing. Their talent is truly astonishing! My friend, Mr. Xie Xian'ou, along with the three elders, Shen Xinhai, Jin Suixiang, and Zhu Liangcai, and the gentlemen Ren Changnian, Chen Zhuting, and Li Pangen, formed the Long Rainbow Studio in Hejia Branch Lane on Shangwen Road, enjoying painting as their daily pleasure. Yesterday, I visited them and saw Mr. Xie was painting a "Snail Shell Taoist Temple" on a fan surface. On the side of a hillside, two old men sat, leisurely watching a snail's opening and closing. Due to the size ratio, the snail only occupied a corner of the fan surface. Inside the shell, several generations of monks were performing Buddhist rituals, with scriptures, cushions, incense, flowers, offerings, and the light of the initiation of the bodhisattva. Other items such as tables, benches, bells, drums, gongs, and cymbals were all present. Two lamp stands stood tall in front of the door, and banners fluttered. Using a magnifying glass to examine it, every detail was discernible, without a single careless stroke. It was truly marvelous. Looking around, I saw a large figure hanging on the wall, displaying a radiant spirit and an open composition. The power of the brushstrokes was unparalleled. Compared to the one large and one small of the "Snail Shell" painting, it was as if they were from two different hands. Upon closer inspection, the colors were not yet dry. Mr. Xie stopped his work and discussed figure painting with me, saying, "Figure paintings mostly depict stories and poetic ideas. However, houses, tables, chairs, carriages, clothes, and decorations change with each era. The artist must study the era and incorporate it into the painting. The background, whether it's a tree or a stone, should complement the ups, downs, turns, and sides. The composition should be simple but not desolate, dense but not chaotic, distinguishing between the front and back, so that the distance is naturally apparent. The distance must be measured in inches, and the height must establish a host and guests, so there is no imbalance or overweighting." He also said, "When engaging in painting, one should concentrate all of one's spirit, with the idea preceding the brush, so that the brushstrokes are naturally vigorous and smooth." All of these are words of gained experience, which students of painting should regard as rules. Mr. Xie showed me landscape and flower paintings by the three elders and Chen Zhuting, Chen Ya, Jin Zhuozhuo, Li Pangen, and Zhou Xiaona, all full of ancient charm. I enjoyed them for a long time. I heard that the gentlemen have recently been very enthusiastic and are planning to form a calligraphy and painting society with people in society.</p>

<p>After a year of separation, I came to the window again today, unable to bear watching the continuous disasters.</p>
<h3>Little Western Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 19: An Official Cherishes His Reputation and Knocks on the Door with Skill; New Love Separates Flesh and Blood; Visiting the Sick Is Impossible</p>
<p>You are older than me, you are like my own brother. When an own brother asks his younger brother to do something, why would he need to be polite? You can just order me around. If you don't ask me to do something, it means you think I'm not good enough, and don't want this good-for-nothing as a friend." Duocai was put in an awkward position by his words, and was embarrassed to not ask him for help, so he cupped his hands and said, "In that case, I'll have to trouble you." Shi Lian didn't wait for a second word, and quickly walked towards the back door of Little Western Heaven. Before he even reached Aunt Hu's house, just seeing her front door, he was startled. An old woman as thin as a skeleton was sitting on her front door frame, leaning against the wall. The blue cloth jacket on her body had at least twenty or thirty patches, large and small. She had her legs crossed, and her blue cloth pants were covered in yellow dirt. Her pointed face had yellow-black skin covered in wrinkles, her eyes were sunken, her two cheekbones stuck out, and silvery hair covered her face. In addition, her lifeless eyes were fixedly staring at the back of Little Western Heaven, making her particularly frightening. Therefore, she stood from afar. But that old woman did not forgive people for being afraid of her, and raised a hand like a chicken claw, extending two fingers, pointing at Shi Lian, and slowly said: "Old man, aren't you from Little Western Heaven? Have you seen my Yueying? I'm sick. Alas! I... miss... her." Shi Lian then knew that she was Yueying's grandmother. Since she had spoken, she was a person, and there was no need to be so afraid of her, so he slowly approached her and asked: "Old woman, are you asking about the mistress of the house?" The old woman looked up at him, clasped her palms and bowed twice, tremblingly saying: "Old man, I am a person about to die. I am old enough to die. What is the point of living such a bitter life? My two generations, that little bit of flesh and blood, were sold for a hundred dollars. I... really don't want to... him. His mother, how could she bear to sell him? But we live with relatives, and the relatives are also poor..." (331)</p>
<h3>Records of Imperial Incense Drifting</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>(No chapters listed) Meeting of the Author and Translator</p>
<p>Just as my translation of "Records of Imperial Incense Drifting" was nearing completion, suddenly, like a storm, the original author of the book, "Princess Der Ling," arrived (the title of Princess may still be in question, but until she officially corrects it, I can only continue to use it). In the past few days, various Chinese and Western newspapers in Shanghai have been publishing her actions and conversations. Indeed, since the publication of "Records of Imperial Incense Drifting," this name, which was about to be forgotten, has received the attention of many people again; and she happened to return to her homeland at the right time, so it is no wonder that so many people went to the Cathay Hotel to see her, even to the point where she felt overwhelmed.</p>
<p>The news of her arrival naturally brought me a special kind of excitement, because although I had translated her work so meticulously and gained an understanding of her as a woman full of courage and very fond of joking, I had never directly met her. Since it was difficult for me to go to America to find her, then I would definitely have to see her now that she had come here. But unfortunately, I have been unusually busy lately, and because I suffer from insomnia, I have to rest after eight o'clock in the evening. As a result, I don't have any suitable time to visit this Americanized Chinese lady. Furthermore, one day I accidentally read the North-China Daily News and saw a report about her, which included a very absurd statement, roughly saying that "Princess Der Ling is now a woman without a nationality, since the Qing Dynasty has perished, she has lost her qualification as a Chinese citizen..." I don't know if these words are from the North-China Daily News reporter who lacks common sense, or if they are from this Americanized lady? But no matter what, it made me very unhappy; I don't dare to boast about how patriotic I am, but I would have to sincerely and respectfully visit someone who is clearly a citizen of the Republic of China, but prefers to be a foreigner, that is something I'm unwilling to do, so things have been delayed.

<h3>Small Knowledge</h3>
<p>— (Chuyu)</p>
<p>Knowledge for Distinguishing Butter  Butter is rich in nutrition, but in recent years, there have been many fake products on the market, such as artificial butter masquerading as pure butter, so we should carefully distinguish the quality. Artificial butter is made of synthetic milk and various other fats, with very few nutrients and vitamins, and the smell is also different. The method of distinguishing is to cut a piece of butter with a knife, spread it on bread, and bake it over a fire. If it is of pure quality, then there will definitely be fine bubbles rising, and after the oil dissolves, it will turn yellow. If it is artificial butter, then there will be very few fine bubbles, and there will be a popping sound. After the oil dissolves, white grease will congeal on top.</p>
<p>Eating Milk Requires Avoiding Acidic Products  If lemon, orange, or other acidic fruit juices are mixed into milk, then the acid will react with the protein in the milk and coagulate. Eating this milk can cause indigestion in mild cases and poisoning in severe cases.</p>
<p>Do Not Use Linen Cloth to Wipe Glasses  If you use a linen or silk handkerchief to wipe them, it will damage the lenses and change the light of the lenses. Also, when taking off your glasses, do not let the convex surface of the lens touch the tabletop. You should support the lenses with the temples or place them facing upwards. It is certainly appropriate to use a velvet cloth to wipe the lenses, but if the velvet cloth is used for too long, it will be the same as linen cloth. It is best to use thin pieces of paper (eyeglass paper) to wipe them.</p>
<p>Preventing Soot from Forming on the Bottom of Pots  The bottom of rice pots and vegetable pots will inevitably accumulate black soot from burning wood to cook things. To prevent this, you can first soak the bottom of the pot in water and then rub it with soap. In that case, the soot will dissolve due to the soap and will not easily thicken. If you wash it with water, the soot will also fall off easily. This saves much more effort than using a knife to scrape off the soot.</p>
<p>The Use of Cigarette Butts  Do not throw away the cigarette butts left over from smoking. Collect them in a bucket and soak them in water, because the nicotine in the butts will dissolve in the water. Then, filter it out with gauze. This liquid can be sprinkled in gutters or trash cans to prevent pests from breeding. Also, dipping a brush in this liquid and applying it to the branches and leaves of plants can kill scale insects. This is truly waste utilization, killing two birds with one stone.</p>
<p>Precautions When Wearing Shoes Barefoot  When wearing shoes barefoot, you should first pad the soles with blotting paper, and then line them with thin cloth. In that case, the foot sweat will be absorbed by the blotting paper, and the soles of the feet can be kept clean. If there is a lot of dead skin on the soles of the feet, it is easiest to soil shoes and socks. You should scrape it off with a bamboo chip after washing your feet. New socks, because they have starch, should be washed with warm water first, and then they can be worn.</p>
<p>Disinfecting the Odor in Toilets  To remove the odor from toilets, copper sulfate, potassium permanganate, and camphor are generally used. Other oils such as camphor oil, Abous, and Alis-Taihin all have bactericidal effects. If you scatter camphor balls in the toilet and put naphthalene balls in the urinal, you can avoid foul odors and deodorize, which is more effective than the odor-removing liquids sold on the market.</p>
<p>Writing Method on Metal Utensils  If you want to write or draw on metal utensils, first apply wax to the surface, and carve with a needle. The wax is removed by the needle, leaving holes. Then, pour sulfuric acid or hydrochloric acid into the carved holes, leave it for several hours, and then wash away the acid with water. After scraping off the wax, the written or drawn parts will be corroded by the acid.</p>
<p>Preventing Mirrors and Glass from Fogging  When the weather is cold, indoor mirrors and glass will fog up due to water vapor. The methods to prevent this are as follows: 1. Rub with dry tobacco. 2. Mix half Kresalgin and half clean water, and wipe the mirror surface with a cloth. 3. Add 10% Kresalgin to wood alcohol, first apply it with a cloth, and then wipe it clean with a dry cloth. All of these are effective.</p>
<p>Correction  The article "Literacy Movement" published in the September 23rd issue was written by me. The original manuscript was signed by Wang Shapa. I don't know why it was attributed to Mr. Zhi Yanbo Guang? The issue of article remuneration is a minor matter, but there are some discrepancies involving my wife Lanxin and my young daughter Yanhong, so I hope you will investigate and correct them. Thank you. Wang Shapa</p>

<p>Commercial News</p>
<h3>Finance: The Gold Market Was Weak in the Morning, but Became Stronger Later</h3>
<p>After struggling, it rose slightly by eight cents</p>
<p>The gold market situation remains initially weak, then strong, hovering uncertainly. The Italian-Albanian border has already opened fire. Retail investors are mostly tired, and the market still fell at the opening. Unexpectedly, banks and Sassoon repeatedly struggled, the exchange market suddenly tightened, stimulating buying interest and reversing the rise. Rumors arose in the market. However, because large investors supplied bars at high prices, the result was only a stable close. Early in the morning, the overseas silver market, British gold in the US was stable. Traders said that after the market closed, there were still buyers following the listed price, and sellers needed to add 0.0625. Monte Carlo forward silver prices rose by 1.2 to 3.5 pence. Exchange rates, however, were downstream. London gold rose by one penny. News reports were unfavorable, and people's confidence was difficult to revive. In pre-market trading, the opening was shouted at 82.3 yuan, but it lacked support, and soon fell to about one yuan. Shenfeng and Yongli maintained at a low price, rising to two yuan. Da Decheng, Hengyu, Fuxing, and Yongshang sold and remained weak, opening low. The Central Bank's listed prices were announced, the British gold price was stable, the US gold price was shrinking, and the Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged. The standard gold price was listed at 915 yuan, which was still stable. Large investors purchased bars at a low price, and banks came to settle immediately. It was heard that the HSBC bank's listed prices, British and US gold prices were both stable, gradually rising. Rumors spread that the Central Bank was opening cash, and people's confidence was boosted. The exchange market also tightened and rose. Sellers actively sold at high prices, and there were occasional setbacks along the way. However, because banks and Sassoon repeatedly settled, the exchange market was surprisingly strong and finally remained strong. The Hong Kong market was also good, and the trend was very good. It was expected that large investors would limit sales at high prices, and the rise was hindered. The Indian silver reserve was long at three annas, and the supply was slightly abundant, gradually falling. But at noon, the situation was still stable. The market situation for the first half of the day will be recorded later.</p>
<p>The morning opening was 81 yuan, down 3.7 yuan from the previous close. Although Fuxing Yong sold, it fell back to 0.7 yuan. Da Decheng, Fuxing, Yong, Hengyu all advanced, rising to 2.5 yuan. Yifeng Yong, Yuanchang, Yongjia, and Run sold off, falling to 1.7 yuan. Shanghai bought November at 0.5 pence. It was learned that the Shanghai HSBC listed prices, British and US gold prices were both stable. Fuxing, Yong, Da Decheng, Wanxing, Fuyu, Huixiang, Dada, Hengyu, Wanfeng, Yuqing, Yongqing, Fa Yong, etc. successively purchased bars, gradually rising. Huabi bought US dollars at 5.625 for November, and it was rumored that the Central Bank was opening cash, rising to 5.4 yuan. Dada, Huixiang, Da Decheng, Hengyu, and Yuanheng sold off, falling to 3.8 yuan. Sassoon settled the account, Yifeng, Yong, Fuxing, Yong, Da Decheng, Huixiang, Chunyuan Yong Hengyu, Yuqing Yong even advanced to 5.8 yuan. Fuxing Yong Chunyuan Yong Yuan sold off, returning to 4.8 yuan. Yifeng, Yong, Dada, and Fuxing Yong even advanced, rising to 6.2 yuan. Hengchang Yong Yongli sold off, falling back to 5.2 yuan. Macgarry ate US dollars at 3.75 for November, even rising to 6.5 yuan. It was good that Yifeng, Yong, Yuanmao, Yongli, and Changda all advanced. However, Yongli Hengyu sold off from time to time, falling to 5.3 yuan. Huabi Sassoon has bought December US dollars at seven yuan. Dingkang, Fuxing, Yong, Hengyu, and Huixiang came to advance, rising to 6.8 yuan. Hengyu Fuxing Yong sold off, falling again to 5.7 yuan. The Hong Kong market turned soft. Fuxing, Yong, Qianyuan, Yong, Ri Chang, Yuankang, Xiang Yongli also accepted, and it rose to 7.1 yuan. Shenfeng Hengchang Yong Hengyu Quan Decheng Yongli sold bars at high prices. It is predicted that Indian silver will rise by three annas, falling to 4.2 yuan. Hengyu Fuxing Yong still came to maintain, rising back to 5.7 yuan.

<h3>Securities Stocks The Bull Market Is Still Struggling</h3>
<p>Prices fluctuate… Resulting in more declines than gains</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, the bullish side was still holding on. Major players were reluctant to emerge. Although negative news from abroad was seen, the market did not show any signs of panic. This was because major bullish investors were heavily invested and it was difficult for them to change direction immediately. A slight movement would affect the overall situation. The 96 Government Bond, due to several major bullish players holding a significant amount, attempted to artificially raise the market price, so that retail short sellers would cover their positions, allowing them to profit from the high prices. However, this common trick has been seen through by most people. Yesterday's trading saw a uniform decline at the opening. The 10th and 48th issues saw a surge in selling pressure, falling by 2-3 jiao to as much as 6-7 jiao compared to the previous day. In the second session, some people stepped in to support the market, buying the 21st issue. Retail investors also covered their short positions. The market price mostly rose, with a few declines, by about 0.15 jiao to 0.3 jiao. In the afternoon session, the bullish side continued to push up the market price, raising it by 0.15 jiao to 0.34 jiao. By the close, there was no sign of any further improvement. The market situation was fluctuating, inconsistent, with prices sometimes high and sometimes low, varying by only about 0.1 jiao. The market price ultimately fell back by a small amount, from 0.15 jiao to 0.45 jiao. The total trading volume was 11,158,500 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, trading unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<h3>Floating Long Positions Emerge, Many New York Stocks Turn Downward</h3>
<p>A report from the New Feng Foreign Firm stated that yesterday (the 1st) the New York stock market was initially quite strong. Before the close, railway stocks suddenly plummeted, and a large number of floating long positions emerged, causing considerable confusion in the market. Automobile, steel, copper and utility stocks had initially risen, but then all turned downward. Stocks on the small exchange rose. The bond market was mixed, with railway bonds slightly declining. The total trading volume for the day was 1,420,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below.</p>
<h3>Yarn and Cotton Current Sales Are Still Strong, Three Types of Products Are Stable, Marked Yarn Tries to Rise but Turns Back</h3>
<p>The yarn market started to rise and then turned back, making the situation more moderate. This is because the Osaka three types of yarn are stable, and the bullish investors will sell the goods they received last month in the October period, which is a considerable amount. They are deeply afraid of having to deliver all of them, so the market has become a near-low, far-high front. However, current yarn sales are quite active, and the underlying foundation is a bit more stable than before.</p>
<p>Securities Dealers Sell Golden Chickens</p>
<p>The opening price of marked yarn in the previous market was uniformly higher for all months, and the situation looked sharp again. Because people were very bullish last month, and news from the US cotton market also showed a rise of more than 20 pounds, people's spirits were high, and retail investors covered their positions. Unexpectedly, as prices rose, securities dealers and Changfeng suddenly began to sell, in even larger quantities. After the second session, prices fell step by step. The prices for the near two months fell below the previous day's price. The market mostly said that the bullish investors who received the goods last month had handed them all over in the October period, so the recent market price has been weakening. As a result, the near month fell by 0.23 jiao compared to the previous month's closing price, and the far month rose by 0.12 jiao. In the afternoon session, it was heard that current yarn transactions were still good and rose slightly. However, after selling in the second and third sessions, the Osaka three types of yarn were flat, and people's spirits softened again. But Changfeng came to buy again. As a result, this month fell by 0.4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price, and the far month was flat. It was found that Daji sold 250 bales, Jinchang 1,100 bales, Gengfeng 850 bales, Changfeng 1,550 bales, Fang Shengyuan 500 bales, Shenji 500 bales, and Runkang 350 bales.

<h3>Futures Higher Than Spot, Marked Cotton Bull Positions Slightly Dumped</h3>
<p>The cotton market rose in the morning and fell in the afternoon, and the market condition was slightly weak. This is because at the time when new cotton is being listed, sales are blocked after prices rise, and the marked cotton price is higher than the spot price, so some bullish positions are dumped and turned down.</p>
<p>Zheng Mark Far Month Rises Alone</p>
<p>The Zheng Mark cotton market opened bullish in the morning. US cotton rose, and most people were bullish yesterday. With the help of this good news, the market became tighter. The near month rose especially strongly. However, when the far month was auctioned, the bullish investors released slightly, and the results for each month rose from 0.05 jiao to 0.3 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market situation was still very high in the afternoon session. However, buyers were not very enthusiastic. Later, the Osaka three types of cotton were flat, and the market became even looser. As a result, each month fell back from 0.1 jiao to 0.15 jiao compared to the morning's closing price. It was found that Mingde sold 1,500 dan, Taixing 900 dan, Ruida 2,100 dan, Senkang 1,700 dan, Changyu 1,400 dan, Taichang 1,600 dan, Xiecheng 900 dan, Xincheng 1,000 dan, Changhe 1,800 dan, Shengyuan 1,200 dan, and Yifeng 1,300 dan.

<h3>US Cotton Rises Back by Over 20 Pounds</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the US cotton market opened, and domestic and foreign firms bought at limit prices. The Liverpool market was firm, the Memphis market was strong, and European news was positive. Each month rose by 1 to 8 pounds. Liverpool, the mainland, and the Far East all traded in unison. Given the favorable weather for picking and ginning, short selling seemed to be scarce. Afterwards, the market situation was quiet, waiting for developments. Finally, short-sellers actively covered their positions, and the price soared. It is estimated that the spot price rose by 25 pounds, and the futures price rose by 18 to 25 pounds. British cotton spot fell by 5 points, and futures rose by 7-8 points. Indian cotton saw sporadic purchases, with a few road sales. The market situation was small. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 1.25 rupees, and Aomula and Bailuoxi rose by 0.75 rupees.

<h3>Grains Flour and Wheat Bulls Take Profits</h3>
<p>Market Greatly Declines After Rising</p>
<p>Yesterday's flour market initially saw a sharp rise again, followed by a significant decline. Initially, the quoted price of foreign wheat, Chicago, rose by a huge 0.9 jiao to 1.1 yuan. Canada rose by 0.456 jiao. When the price was opened, the price of foreign wheat continued to rise, and the opening price for this month was 0.62 yuan. The forward price also rose by 0.12 yuan. However, after this peak, the market gradually declined, because many profit-taking bulls took the opportunity to emerge, and those who were nervous said that the fixed price of foreign wheat was only 5.67 yuan, and it would soon be close to it. Therefore, the factory set a forward price, and people felt empty, rising and falling instead, inexplicably. Until the afternoon session, because of the poor atmosphere in the morning, off-site bulls still came back out, and the market continued to decline. The industry observed that the market value seemed to have reached its peak, and the next step was to wait and see.</p>
<p>Yesterday's futures wheat market initially rose. When the price was opened, the price of foreign wheat continued to rise, causing most people to be unusually firm. The current month opened at 0.17 yuan, and November reached 0.19 yuan, which were the highest records. After this, because the flour market rose and fell instead, and the profit-taking was smooth, they also emerged very smoothly, so the market turned weak. Until the afternoon session, the recent period was still popular due to the current wheat, and the forward period was quite popular, and it softened again. However, in terms of the recent situation, it may be a small difference. The current wheat market is still stable. Dongmai opened at 4 yuan, and Hankou wheat opened at 3.85 yuan, totaling 2,000 bags, which was processed by the Fufeng Office. Fuxin processed 1,500 bags of Shandong wheat at a price of 4.1 yuan, which was 0.1 jiao higher than the previous opening price. The market rumored that Japanese merchants sold a ship of No. 4 Canada wheat at a price of only 5.4 yuan.</p>

The appetite of the street is slightly weak, the guest gang stopped, and the rise of the day before yesterday was thwarted.

<h3>A Supplement on the Theory of Tea Drinking Literature</h3>
<p>— Tang Tao</p>
<p>In his Night Voyage Collection, Mr. Aying has an article dedicated to tea drinking, called "On the Theory of Tea Drinking Literature." He points out that tea drinking is an elegant affair for hermits and celebrities, and it is also their privilege. He also explains the boredom of the so-called "entrusting sorrows to bitter tea," and cites extensively, making it a good article that uses the past as a mirror to the present.</p>
<p>Because this question is very interesting, I would also like to talk about it. Why is it called a supplement? That is to say, I want to talk about something that Mr. Aying has not talked about in detail—or even the dross that he despises.</p>
<p>First of all, let's talk about tea drinking. Don't rough people get thirsty after work? It's true that they want to drink tea, but they only know how to drink, but they never thought that they could also eat it. Using a covered bowl, a purple sand teapot, sipping and chewing carefully, paying attention to taste, paying attention to fragrance, and even paying attention to color, these are all the privileges of elegant people, and rough men can't share them. So tea drinking also becomes literature, and it is elegant literature.</p>
<p>It is said that tea leaves were first used as a beverage in the Tang Dynasty, but some say it was in the Jin Dynasty. The Tea Record says: "Tea was not eaten in ancient times. Since the Jin Dynasty, the Wu people have picked the leaves and boiled them, called tea porridge." However, the literature of tea drinking was in the Tang Dynasty anyway. In addition to Lu Yu's (Hongjian) Tea Classic and Lu Tong's (Wangchuanzi) Tea Song, Bai Letian, Liu Yuxi and others also have poems and articles to record it. However, these articles were quite looked down upon by the people of the Song Dynasty because of the progress of tea drinking literature. Yuan Zhifu (Wen) said:</p>
<p>Liu Mengde's tea poem says: "Pick it yourself next to the fragrant bushes, and stir-fry it into a full room of fragrance." From this, we know that the Tang people were not good at drinking tea. If he saw the wonderful works of Cai Junmo and Ding Wei of this dynasty, then he would not write poetry. The freshly picked tea must be fragrant, and its fragrance should be twice that of ordinary tea, not comparable to dragon musk. The ancients used dragon musk in tea, which damaged the tea a lot; tea has a natural fragrance, so why should it be fake to dragon musk! Huang Taishi's poem says: "If you want to grind a cup of new fragrance, you shouldn't pass on treasures to come from the clouds." It is known that the fragrance of new tea is especially lovely. "He also commented on Bai Letian's tea poem and said:</p>
<p>Bai Yaotian's tea poem says: "嘗一 綠昌明", Changming is a place name in Mianzhou, and people say that Changming tea is green, which is not true! This is similar to the sentence "Green dust flies beside the golden grinding plate". It is because he did not know how to make tea at that time, and the production was not fine, so the color of the tea was still green. And the好事者 recorded the beauty of the tea, and did not value white, so his poem is like this. If Letian saw the beauty of today's tea, would he be willing to say this!</p>
<p>The Cai Junmo and Ding Wei (Gongyan) mentioned by Zhifu are two famous tea drinking literati in the Song Dynasty. Su Dongpo's poem says: "粟粒芽 beside the Wuyi stream, with Ding and Cai and cage added before and after." Also said these two. Ding Gongyan wrote a tea picture, and Cai Junmo wrote a tea record.</p>
<p>Mr. Aying described the tea drinking literature of the Ming Dynasty in great detail in "On the Theory of Tea Drinking Literature," so there is no need to repeat it here. However, since Wang Mengduan passed Wuxi, visited Huishan, entered Ting Song'an, and built a bamboo stove, everyone who visited Huiquan had to write a few poems. During the Qing Dynasty, there were dozens of families including Li Dongyang. These poems are all collected behind the Ming Dynasty printed tea making new book reprinted during the Guangxu period.</p>
<p>The method of tea drinking became more and more advanced in the Qing Dynasty, but that literature was not as good as that of the predecessors. For example, in the tea making new book, I personally think that the works of the Qing Dynasty are far inferior to those before the Qing Dynasty. For example, Yong Shuangjing Tea Yun:</p>
<p>In a place where people cannot reach the wind and sun, the Supreme Jade Hall is full of treasures. I can imagine Dongpo, an old recluse, waving his pen and pouring out hundreds of hu of bright pearls. My family in Jiangnan picks Yunyu, 落 纷纷雪不如. I will wake up the dream of Huangzhou for you and return to the lake in a flat boat.</p>
<p>Although this consciousness is still the old consciousness of the traditional tea drinking literati, and there is no creation, but if you talk about words, it is really much better than those who deliberately carve. For example, Lu Tong's Tea Song not only said:</p>
<p>... Yuchuanzi, take this clear wind to go back, the group of immortals on the mountain are in charge of the land, the status is clear and high, separated by wind and rain, how can you know that hundreds of millions of creatures suffer with cliffs? Ask the common people from Jian Ji again, can they get respite in the end?</p>
<p>Can a great work that specializes in helping poetry and boosting literary thoughts be said to be better than this? Drinking tea without forgetting the tea pickers is really a branch of tea drinking literature.</p>
<p>The current bitter tea faction has nothing to do with this other branch, because they still want to be secluded and elegant, which is the authentic orthodoxy. I remember that Fengshi Wenjianji recorded the story of Lu Hongjian, the tea ancestor:</p>
<p>Li Jiqing was sent to comfort Jiangnan, and tea drinking was becoming popular at that time. Lu Yu came to see him. After sitting down, he cooked tea himself, and talked about the names of the tea, distinguishing and pointing out. Duke Li looked down on him in his heart. After the tea was over, he ordered the slave to take thirty Wen to pay the tea doctor.</p>
<p>Although this seems to spoil the scenery, it is still pleasant to treat those tea children and tea grandchildren who specialize in elegance.</p>
<h3>Novels of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom</h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>Beyond the *Taiping Heavenly Kingdom Trimetrical Classic*, the most important item in this unique manuscript is a novel about the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom. Everyone discusses the poetry and prose of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, but obviously little has been said about novels, naturally due to the scarcity of materials. The Taiping Heavenly Kingdom did have its own novels. What were the content and form of their novels? This article provides some hints. Its foundation remains built on religion, "mythologizing" all "human affairs." The novel is titled "True Account of the Origins of the Uprising," with the subtitle "Newly Engraved in the Third Year of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom." The character "Quan" in Xiuquan's name is written as "泉," avoiding the Heavenly King's taboo. The author's surname is Zeng, but the given name is unknown. In the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, this novel should occupy a significant position. Its content describes the history of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom's uprising and explains the meaning of the uprising. The full text is less than two thousand words, and I present it again to readers as valuable, initial historical material of Taiping Heavenly Kingdom culture.</p>
<p>"True Account of the Origins of the Uprising, Newly Engraved in the Third Year of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom"</p>
<p>Zeng said: Mencius said that a true king arises every five hundred years. From Hongwu until now, more than five hundred years have passed, and the rise of a true king is at hand. In the third year of Shunzhi, Zhu's descendants of Taichang settled in Liushuwan of Guohua, and today there are only a few dozen families. To the west of the bay is Chaxiang Ridge. In the first year of Daoguang, Mr. Lin Qing from Henan built a thatched hut on the side of the ridge and lived there. He called himself the Chaxiao Recluse, and he could observe qi, predict fortune and misfortune, and was always accurate. He once told someone, "Auspicious qi rises from the Zhu Bay, and great nobility will surely emerge." On the eighteenth day of the fourth month of the sixth year [of Daoguang], Zhu Fan dreamt at night that a divine being rode a yellow dragon past Liushuwan, preceded by two boys as guides. She awoke with a start and abdominal pain, giving birth to a son. That night, a red light shone in the western sky, visible far and wide, and no one could fathom its origin. I, Zeng, live on Laoya Slope, three miles from Liushuwan. I was forty-seven years old, and that night my wife also gave birth, delivering twin boys. Three days later, I heard about the Fan family's dream and was surprised. I went to inquire with Mr. Chaxiao. The master was unwilling to speak openly. After repeated inquiries, he instructed me not to leak the divine secret. He whispered to me, "The one riding the yellow dragon past Liushuwan is the incarnation of Jesus. The two boys are the incarnations of Yuntan and Yunfan. Rejection of evil and return to the right will occur after the fish and turtles dwell in the mountains." In the sixth year, the Zhu family invited my two sons to study with Mr. Chaxiao. The master was versed in the writings of Confucius and Mencius and knowledgeable in the military strategies of Sun Tzu and Wu Qi. He taught the classics earnestly by day and military strategy at night. The students were extraordinarily quick-witted. Over ten years, they made academic achievements. Someone asked the master, "Those who succeed in learning will surely achieve fame. The students have achieved great success, but why do they not pursue fame and fortune?" The master smiled without answering. On the ninth day of the ninth month of the twenty-first year [of Daoguang], the master invited me to climb the ridge peak. We sat on a boulder, looked up at the celestial phenomena, and he pointed out the positions of the stars, saying, "This one will rise, and that one will fall." I listened silently. He pointed again, saying, "Black qi fills the northwest, and fish and turtles will dwell in the mountains." He advised me to move. I was reluctant to leave my hometown, but he did not move. On the jiazi day of the eleventh month, the master dismissed the students and burned down the thatched hut at night, disappearing without a trace. The following year, there was indeed a great flood, and the mountains and plains were submerged. For eight years, the imperial court did not provide disaster relief, and the county imposed penalties for resisting taxes. The people who fled, died, and were wiped out are countless. Hong Xi'en of Changle Village in Zhongxiang was a good man. His two sons, the elder son Xiuquan, was versed in military strategy and was once recommended as a cultured and filial scholar. The younger son, Xiuzhen, was both wise and brave and was once recommended as a martial and filial scholar. His family was as wealthy as Tao Zhu and surpassed Cheng Luo in wealth. In the face of this great disaster, he generously gave aid. Countless people in the county, supporting the old and carrying the young, flocked to the Hong family seeking relief. I, along with Zhu, led my two sons to visit him, and we talked all day, as if we were old acquaintances. We were invited to stay at the Shangzhi Hall in the Fuyuan Garden. The county magistrate, Wen Keyao, held a grudge against Xi'en for refusing to lend him money. He accused him of seeking to win over the hearts of the people, arrested Xi'en and imprisoned him, and sent soldiers to escort him to the provincial authorities. The entire county refused to submit and ambushed and killed dozens of government soldiers on the road. Civil and military officials sent urgent reports, and troops were dispatched to carry out arrests throughout the county. Xi cried, "For the sake of my family, the entire county will be harmed. I cannot bear it. Quickly bind me and my son and send us to the prefect to save the lives of the entire county." Zhu said, "No, things have come to this, there is no use in acting like children. When our teacher, Mr. Lin Qing, set up his school on Chaxiao Ridge, he said: When fish and turtles dwell in the mountains, the people will suffer terribly. Before the affairs of Jiuli, a blood oath is sworn with sacrificial animals. West of Guohua, north of Hongdou. Heroes gather like clouds, and the oath is jointly sworn. Now it has come true. I have heard that in Guangdong Province there is Wanding Mountain, which stretches for over a hundred li and is very steep. Heroes gather there and have established four kings. The Eastern King, Yang Junfu, the Western King, Xiao Jicheng, the Southern King, Qian Shaoyao, and the Northern King, He Youdong, all have the talent to govern the world. They have brave men under their command, numbering over ten thousand. My friend, Guo Wannian of Jingxi, has communicated with the four kings. Please take this matter to them, and it will surely succeed. I and Brother Xiu will unite the respected scholars and righteous men of the entire county, eliminate corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats, confiscate all the records of Guohua, and wait for the heroes to gather and dominate Guangxi. We will assess the situation, deploy troops, and store grain, straddling Guangdong and Guangxi, and sweeping through Hubei. We will control Jiujiang and march straight down, dividing into five armies to drive forward. The people of Jiangnan will surely be terrified by the news, lacking the wisdom to plan and the courage to act. Taking Nanjing will be as easy as shaking off withered leaves. From then on, we will use Nanjing as our base, pacifying them if they are compliant and conquering them if they resist. In less than ten years, the world will be settled. Why cling to petty faith and minor details, and head towards danger and destruction, fulfilling the desires of the fox and dog party?" Xi was delighted and said, "Zhu's words are correct. Today, it is you who will ruin your family and sacrifice your body, and it is you who will transform your family into a nation." Thus, they recruited brave men from far and wide, not even speaking, they had already over ten thousand people. In front of Jiuli Pavilion, they swore an oath of blood together. The crowd pushed Xi to be the leader of the alliance. Xi said, "I am old! There is Zhu present!" The corrupt officials and greedy bureaucrats have all been killed. Guo called for the heroes to gather at Wanding. Again, they swore an oath of blood, and Xi was still appointed as the leader of the alliance. Xi again said, "There is Zhu present!" The kings were all sincerely convinced. This happened in the third month of the twenty-ninth year [of Daoguang]. I remember the words of Lin Qing, Mr. Xiaoguang, were truly the foresight of the master, and they have proven accurate to this day. But where is the master, that he does not participate in this alliance? I deeply regret it. I want to magnify the master's name and write this record."</p>
<p>The author of this text has considerable literary talent. As recorded, aside from the mythological parts, all are actual events, which will bring about many changes to our past known thoughts and facts. And what is particularly noteworthy is that the author is making every effort to promote "Zhu Sheng," and says very little about Xiuquan. From the lines between the words, it seems that he is quite indignant for "Zhu Sheng." Thus, the internal contradictions of the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom in the early stages, the news of which can be seen in this. But who is this "Zhu Sheng"? What is meant by "first first thing," generally spoken, "smoke bomb" only.</p>
<h3>Fellow Villagers (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>This fellow villager of mine was very good at speaking. He even carried a deck of Holland cards and was quite skilled at playing. But I didn't feel any interest in him. "Then let's talk about something," he pushed the cards towards his wicker basket.</p>
<p>"Little brother," he began calling me that. "You're still young and very naive! For example, gambling with Holland cards, you're not my match. If you have five hundred, you'll lose five hundred, not even a penny will be left! You know I've traveled all over the British and Dutch territories, made friends with big bosses, and scratched out two hundred dollars playing mahjong in Chinese associations!" His eyebrows rose, and he touched his chin, where coarse black whiskers grew.</p>
<p>I didn't say anything, letting him continue: "How many years have you been away from ××? I left when I was nineteen, and only went back last winter. ×× is not like it used to be: roads, cars, movie theaters, and prostitutes—guess what they're like? Naturally, they're better than the native women in Batavia or Singapore. Clean and tidy, at least they won't give you syphilis... What's wrong, little brother? You're carrying on like a young virgin who's never touched a woman's flesh!"</p>
<p>I felt uneasy in front of this worldly man. He was talking about things that Genwu had never mentioned to me, although Genwu was perhaps even more experienced than him. He seemed very clever, and when he discovered that I wasn't interested in women, he immediately changed the subject:</p>
<p>"I forgot to ask you, what are you going to Medan to do?"</p>
<p>"Me? Someone introduced me to a minor position at the Chamber of Commerce there."</p>
<p>"That's good, little brother, a minor position—young people, how can they become secretaries or chairmen right after leaving their thatched huts? And do you know the current situation, what they call: recession! There are so many unemployed people. You're very lucky!" He leaned against the half-old leather suitcase and finished speaking, sometimes staring at me. When he smiled, I could see his teeth that had turned black.</p>
<p>Having a fellow villager on the journey who liked to talk did indeed break the loneliness of a single traveler. But I never understood what kind of person he was. Several times I tried to ask him, but he cleverly evaded the questions. Once he even said this:</p>
<p>"Little brother, what are you worried about! With someone as honest and reliable as you, I must promote you. Wait until you get to Medan, and I'll give you a not-so-small position."</p>
<p>But what I saw was a not-so-wealthy steerage passenger, just like me, with only two pieces of luggage and the shirt he was wearing seemed to have not been changed for a long time, with stains all over the collar and back. He smoked cheap cigarettes; even once when I was walking with him past a place that sold cigarettes, he asked me if I had money for two packs of Elephant Brand cigarettes.</p>
<p>"I don't know when my small change was used up. Give it to me, little brother. We must talk about fellow villager feelings."</p>
<p>Using the fine-sounding term of fellow villager feelings, this self-proclaimed elder took the money for his cigarettes from my dry pocket. While smoking, he said to me:</p>
<p>"For the sake of fellow villager feelings, I will definitely take good care of you. Tomorrow morning the ship will enter Belawan, and from there you can take a car to Medan."</p>
<p>In this way, he wanted my luggage to be placed with his, to go ashore together. When I handed him the leather suitcase, his hand kept touching it, and he exclaimed:</p>
<p>"Good stuff! Worth ten dollars of goods!"</p>
<p>The ship stopped at Belawan. I followed the colonial government's disembarkation procedures to the immigration office to report. The fellow villager and the luggage waited for me outside, because he was an old customer, he only needed to present his residence permit for inspection and it was done. The head of the immigration office, while staring at my face with his deep blue eyes, searched for words to interrogate me. In this way, a full half hour passed, and like releasing a prisoner, I was let out. Outside, there were many cars, carriages, and people walking around. I looked for that fellow villager, but there was no sign of him!</p>
<p>In the letter to Genwu, I wrote:</p>
<p>"Genwu: I arrived here safely, but the luggage is gone. It's not finally because I don't know anyone, I met a very fellow villagerly ×× person on the ship. But this fellow villager has now disappeared along with my luggage..." (The End)</p>
<h3>Night Scene of the City</h3>
<p>— Tong Qinglan</p>
<p>This boundless night wind</p>
<p>Shakes the brass bell in front of the rickshaw,</p>
<p>Mixed in with the motorcycle horn,</p>
<p>Sharply piercing through the heart of the street;</p>
<p>Sweat squeezed out,</p>
<p>Mixed with the dust underfoot,</p>
<p>On the smooth floor,</p>
<p>Whiskey mixes messily;</p>
<p>Thin, bony hands</p>
<p>Pull the wheels forward,</p>
<p>Soft, fat arms</p>
<p>Drag tender, white flesh to roll;</p>
<p>Sand fills empty stomachs,</p>
<p>The roadside ditch</p>
<p>Flows with fermented leftovers;</p>
<p>This deathly still world</p>
<p>Is filled with dimness,</p>
<p>This night scene will continue until dawn.</p>

<h3>Honorable Old Woman (1)</h3>
<p>— Written by Jiang Ma Xiu, Translated by Ren Gou</p>
<p>Recently, I just wanted to see Chaplin's "Kid," so we ran into a suburban movie theater. However, the delightful "Kid" had already been half shown and was about to end. Next, the famous military propaganda film "Colonel Yoshioka" began. I felt very disappointed and planned to go back immediately, but having spent money to specially run in here, it was inevitably a pity to go out like this.</p>
<p>"Hey, what do you think? Do you want to continue watching?" I asked my wife who came with me.</p>
<p>"Well," she hesitated: "But we have already come specially, so let's watch another one. I haven't seen Japanese movies for a long time, so it's okay to watch one occasionally."</p>
<p>"But, 'Colonel Yoshioka'..."</p>
<p>"That doesn't matter. Let's see what military propaganda films are like and use it as a reference."</p>
<p>"What you said also makes sense."</p>
<p>So I sat down and continued to watch "Colonel Yoshioka," which was starting on the screen.</p>
<p>My wife and I haven't watched Japanese movies at all in the past few years. Past disappointments simply didn't allow us to have the mood to watch Japanese movies. But now, as we watched "Colonel Yoshioka," first of all, we felt admiration and felt that Japanese movies had also greatly improved. The development of the plot was very natural, without exaggeration. The selection of each scene and the methods of photography were also very clever. The actors also performed enthusiastically and skillfully. The humor shown in various places was also quite effective, very suitable for the audience's tastes. In particular, what was shown in the film was the Japanese life that we were in, everything was very cordial and could be deeply felt. Even the performances that made people laugh were not like watching Chaplin's movies, feeling that they were things that were far away from us; on the contrary, they could make people feel vividly that they were really very close to us and very consistent with the situation. The film slowly played on, and the crowd filled in the theater gradually became enthusiastic. To be honest, even we finally watched quite enthusiastically.</p>

<h3>The Increase in Crime</h3>
<p>— Xiong Cheng</p>
<p>Previously saw the newspaper report: "According to the Public Concession Bureau Police Department's August report: The number of reported criminal cases this month totaled 1,422, an increase of 29% compared to July, and also an increase of 34 cases compared to the same month last year; the number of criminals arrested this month also increased compared to the previous figures, totaling 1,374 people... If we speak of the types of crimes separately, there was one murder case and one attempted murder case in August. There were a total of nineteen robbery cases this month, sixteen ordinary theft cases, and thirty-seven house theft cases..."</p>
<p>In Shanghai, China, the Public Concession of Shanghai (excluding the French Concession and the Chinese territory), in the month of August alone, there were 1,422 criminal cases "reported," and 1,374 criminals were arrested. Compared with the same month last year and the previous month of this year, there has been an increase. This is truly "enough to be alarming."</p>
<p>If we calculate the total number of cases in all of Shanghai, within twelve months, and those not "reported," what a huge number it will be. If we speak of the whole of China, what a huge number it will be!</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, the large number of criminal cases completely reflects the extent to which the current economic recession in Chinese society has deepened. At the same time, from the statement "an increase of thirty-four cases compared to the same month last year...an increase of twenty-nine cases compared to July," it can be seen that the recession is deepening rapidly!</p>
<p>However, what is the reason for this phenomenon? Obviously, this is definitely not because of "people's hearts not being as ancient as they used to be, the world's customs are declining," but rather the widespread "daily life is declining." The poor are even poorer; those who "could still manage" in the past have all become poor. In the context of the bankruptcy of agriculture and the accelerated collapse of the economy in rural areas, closures, layoffs, and unemployment have formed widespread poverty. Ordinary people, because of "lack of means to survive," have no choice but to seek other ways out and "go down the wrong path." Finally, they "commit crimes" and "disrupt public order."</p>
<p>Therefore, this state of increase can absolutely not be stopped simply by increasing police force. In other words, if we do not think about improving the people's lives from this fundamental problem, then not only will we absolutely not eliminate this phenomenon, but on the contrary, it will only increase. So where do we start to improve the lives of ordinary people? In today's world, there is no "utopia" with no unemployment and very few crimes. May I ask, what path do we take to leave?</p>
<h3>Small Memories of an Ancient City</h3>
<p>— Luye</p>
<p>One year, I lingered in an ancient city. Now let me write a little bit of a memory here.</p>
<p>This ancient city, so I am not unfamiliar, customs and practices and simple folk, I also know and understand a little bit of; The scenery of the ancient city is also unique and interesting. If you want me to tell you the historical changes passed down from those ancient cities, I can also tell you. But this, someone has already taken as a historical record and notes of the information, and I can not write all the legends of the ancient city, and one by one the history and anecdotes. Here, let me first describe a little of the scenery of the ancient city.</p>
<p>On the city walls, there is not a single purple wild flower to decorate it, nor is there a single stem of foxtail grass or dandelion growing alone; In the past, there were also one or two gray soldiers on the city walls, dozing in the autumn sun, with their gun barrels facing the sky and their knees touching their knees, their military caps were pulled down low, and not even their mouths could be seen there. Interesting wild children, inserting a thin bamboo branch between their knees, the dry leaves rustling in the autumn wind; There are also some whose backs are painted with a large turtle, which seems to be slowly crawling on its back when viewed from a distance. When lonely, leaning on the railing in the small building and looking out, a knowing smile, often spreading on the corners of the mouth and eyebrows, can relieve some boredom. And this lonely, picturesque scenery, further increases the gray oldness of the ancient city!</p>
<p>Secondly, is the Drum Tower, in the ancient city, although is a feature, but it is not an original creation. And this drum tower, like others, is not worth investigating the details, can it be said that it can be distinguished how many years the drum tower has been? And the mythological legends are difficult to convince people, but in the ancient city there is a drum tower, which is ultimately the original color of this ancient city, we can know it without saying it. And the Drum Tower, to the wandering sons, who are wandering around in different places, has a little comfort, and also has a sad feeling. If one sleeps alone on the bed in the middle of the night, sticking to the wall and listening to the night watchman in the small alley, coughing with each step, has already accurately found which stone block is high and which stone is low, walking and knocking on the bamboo clapper, stopping at the bottom of the building, as usual, he is preparing to sleep stealthily here for a while. At this time, I can think of a small-mouthed lantern, quietly placed next to the bamboo clapper, illuminating a small square of the ground, and the sleepy face of the old night watchman.</p>
<p>At this moment, the big clock on the Drum Tower is striking, I can gently count them carefully: one, two, three, ... thinking, in this night without a big moon, where is there another fire, in the fire will be buried how many lives? I don't know how many wandering hearts have been pierced; this is not a schadenfreude psychology, but I, also feel that the night is long, boundless............</p>
<p>Is it really schadenfreude? However, this, can also make people suddenly miss each other, comforting the lonely heart of the solitary guest, in this night, can have dreams of the ancient city, absurd, magical and interesting, in the dream, one is almost invincible, can forget the hardship of being a guest, the heart from then on contains a kind of blind ambition for the times, this, the Drum Tower is given to people warmth.</p>
<p>In addition, gray sand is also a feature of the ancient city. On a windy day, the sky roads, the roofs are full of gray sand flying in a hazy way: on this day, in the evening when leaving work and rushing home, one can no longer see the person opposite. On the road, there is only a clang of the rickshaw puller's bells, seemingly ringing in the ears, looking back in the gray sand vague can see slightly red lanterns shuttling on the road. In the big wind, one cannot open one's mouth to speak loudly, as soon as one opens one's mouth, the gray sand drills into one's mouth, it is full, one can only close one's mouth tightly, bow one's head and walk, one's pace also hastens to rush home, one's face is covered with a thick layer of gray dust, only a pair of black eyes and a mouth are left, which can be seen in rotation. If you use</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>Fingers cock the nostrils, have long been filled with gray earth, so, I can only smile bitterly.</p>
<p>But on a torrential rainy day, one can only run barefoot on the muddy road, and one must always be careful not to fall into the small mud edges of the empty streets.</p>
<p>In the ancient city, only the above-mentioned scenery can give me long-lasting memories.</p>
<h3>Song of the Night</h3>
<p>— Xin Er</p>
<p>(I) Dream</p>
<p>Moving to Jiangwan, a semi-rural area, I wanted to refresh my life, hoping to sort out the mess, the tangled feelings like a nightmare, next to the quiet and beautiful countryside. And perhaps I could purify my mind and write something. However, the countryside is quiet, but it is as if the old is always feeling somewhat lost; uneasiness and worries in the lonely black house, even more shadowy flashes!</p>
<p>For several years, what has made me tremble the most, what has been the most unbearable is: all night, as soon as I close my eyelids, I fall into a dream, at first it makes people feel more uneasy nostalgia, but gradually, it is just like dust blown by the wind, a mess of dreams. Waking up, I just feel dizzy and swollen, thinking of the life of cracking the whip and brandishing the claws, just at a loss, just like a lost child, confused and unable to distinguish. Recalling the clear and determined spirit of waking up from a sweet dream in the past, I shed tears. How can I struggle? Many people teach me to be quiet, to use my brain less, to take medicine, and not to be overly excited or sad; however, these are all very far away from me. These are all good friends of another kind of people. I can only groan far away under the iron hooves of life.</p>
<p>Ahead is a long journey! How will I, like a disabled traveler, get through it! This wounded traveler!</p>
<p>(II) Insomnia</p>
<p>However, the dreams only intensify. For a whole year now, I can't remember the appearance of the dream... Opening my eyes, even if I recall for half a day, I just can't support my dizzy head and fall down. Ah, will I never have a time to wake up from a dream! Closely following, disillusionment, the fantasy of escaping reality, gently floats up. Thus, during the day, fantasy and dreams also form a pitch-black mass. Thus, insomnia is sucking the blood that is about to dry up!</p>
<p>A dark night, a small, messy house. A dog is barking in the distance, the night wind carries the sound, passing into the silent window: the sound of the battle between life and death—I consciously tremble like this. I can't control my terrifying wailing and try my best to think! How can I shake up the life that is heading towards destruction! However, tired, confused, with anger wrapped around my body, tossing and turning, panting, opening my eyelids, countless black spots flash in front of me, I simply turn on the electric light, silence, desolation, sadness, I can only collapse, and still turn off the electric light. Closing my eyes, I can't control the thoughts that are even more chaotic like waves crashing. I regret that I shouldn't have, not silently let it pass.</p>
<p>"The past, but I can't get through it!" Another burst of burning pain.</p>
<p>Life is like smoke, not worth a few cents, like a chaotic dream! However, life must eventually go on, and before life, is an endless sea! Insomnia, chewing on me, I can only be like a dying worm. ...</p>
<p>(III) Song of the Night</p>
<p>Only in extreme fatigue, at the peak of confusion, when turning around from the tip, do I get a half-thread of quiet rest. And the song of the night, leaking in from the half-open window, makes me somewhat relieved to listen attentively.</p>
<p>Listen, this midnight song of Jiangwan! Although it is very ordinary.</p>
<p>Often it is the rhythmic sound of horseshoes hitting the cement, clattering, deeper and more powerful than the sound of frogs, it is the heavy footsteps of the traveling camel in this desert, doubly touching the heart of the traveler waiting to move forward, and making me seem to be slightly awake. From high to low to far away, and vaguely, disappearing so beautifully memorable; but just as I am finding the tail sound that seems to leave infinite aftertaste, the fresher and more powerful clattering footsteps surge up behind, faintly like the sound of war horses leaping on the battlefield. It makes me suddenly wake up and calmly open my eyes.</p>
<p>Ah, I breathed a sweet breath! It turned out that the slanting moon at the window was faintly beautiful and clear, my mind was refreshed, walking close to the window, I distinguished it! Is this the time for the grooms to let the horses go? That is the horse's feet moving forward! The dark night is about to end! Just as I was in doubt, a heroic singing sound came from afar, quickly, as if urging people under the window. Intermittently, it is all the country people who are carrying heavy burdens and going to the city, that hard, strong, and energetic labor song, deeply immersing into my empty heart.</p>
<h3>Laughter</h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>— A laugh a day, Keeps the doctor away. ("Laugh once a day, tell the doctor to get lost.")</p>
<p>An American wealthy businessman-type old gentleman, using a gentlemanly polite, unhurried tone, gently patted me on the shoulder, trying his best to look extremely sincere and concerned, said to me:</p>
<p>"Hey, kid, you're young, it's the age to be energetic, why are you always so gloomy, with a mourning face! Foreigners say: "Laugh once a day, tell the doctor to get lost": that's why foreigners are all energetic and can do great things: young people should always smile—I myself often had bright smiles when I was young. Yes, young people should always smile, should make themselves happy, should be energetic..."</p>
<p>There are so many "shoulds"! From his special expression, I saw a kind of despicable false sincerity hidden under his wrinkled face, covered under his British gentleman-style court dress! This is less of an encouragement from an old man to a young man in life, and more like a cruel carnivore filthily mocking a defeated little sheep in the victory of violence and immorality! So, in order to repay a gentleman's excessive "kindness", I finally laughed! I exposed all my teeth, opened my mouth, and shook my lips like a spasm.</p>
<p>"God, you kid! You laugh so terribly!"</p>
<p>"Yes, sir, I am not familiar with laughter."</p>
<p>"When you were a child, you saw your mother's lovely face, you saw the stars in the sky, didn't you often laugh?"</p>
<p>"No, sir, in my childhood, I saw my mother being beaten half to death by my father, I saw the wind blowing and rain and snow falling non-stop in winter, I often cried! Crying like..."</p>
<p>"God! What is this? What is this? This..."</p>
<p>"What is this?" It's really seeing his mother's ghost! Dragging a twenty-five-year-old body (is the "lovely young generation"!), dragging a "life" that is as heavy as a garbage dump, being suppressed under people every day, so that I can't even breathe! As tired as a sick stray dog, still laugh?</p>
<p>When has the term "laughter" (maybe there really is such a thing in the world? Maybe there isn't?) ever existed in my life history? I dare not recall the past, and dare not imagine the future. Living day after day like a machine with strange sounds of friction, I live in the world day after day.</p>
<p>In dreams, in the infrequent meditation, I often think like this: maybe there was another kind of laughter when I was a child? But what kind of thing should this be? And now, growing up, being thrown into the lonely and helpless oil pot of life, and those smiles, like encountering the most violent bombs, are blown to pieces, destroyed beyond recognition, and disappeared.</p>
<p>Disappeared! That is a scar of life that can never be recovered; that is a scar of life that can never be repaired! There are so many people who tell me many "shoulds" in suffering, such as: young people "should" be happy and energetic, "should" laugh!</p>
<p>However, what life can allow you to choose is only "yes" and "no", not "should" and "should not". For example: wandering, hunger, hardship, fatigue... Can that long string of ominous words still be explained with "should" and "should not"?</p>
<p>"Laugh," I often say to myself, "it's the time to be young, young people should always laugh!"</p>
<p>However, in the end I can only terribly show my teeth, shake, spasm, and babble; I understand: under the suppression of a not-so-light life, I am always clumsy at laughing; and laughter is not willing to climb onto my lowly face.</p>
<p>Has anyone ever seen the southern sun shine on the snowy land of the northern country?</p>

<h3>Silver Waves</h3>
<p>— Ai Tu</p>
<p>I love Macau on the shore of the raging waves, not because it is the Monte Carlo of the East—a complex big gambling place. But I am affected by a fresh and beautiful demeanor that blends the Eastern and Western Hemispheres. That's right: I always miss her like this, just like missing an unopened bud.</p>
<p>When I returned south this time, I had to wander to the beach of Macau again.</p>
<p>In the evening, when the steamer sailed from Guangzhou to the port of Macau, we could look out from the cabin, the waves constantly floating on the vast sea, as if silver was floating and floating, and at the same time, I heard the usual violent sound of the waves, which was carried by the sea breeze. The mountain peaks on the isolated coast are hung with charming colored lights. This is different from Hong Kong, more silent, just like a maiden in boudoir.</p>
<p>When I arrived in Macau and stepped on the stone-paved road of the pier, I routinely saw many flower-like girls standing on it waiting for their friends to come up. The daughters of Monte Carlo in the East are romantic, although the retro-style ethical and religious ideas are also strongly prevailing in the South, but, look! They are jumping and laughing so warmly and lovely, just like the silver waves at night are high-spirited, sounding a majestic tune, floating with the melody of the sea breeze, plus the women's singing coming out of the tall hotels, it constitutes a new circle of music.</p>
<p>After wandering around the prosperous streets with friends for a night, we entered the only magnificent dance floor and watched the enthusiastic demeanor of the people in the South, which was fascinating. Late at night, we began to wander again on the vast, clean and quiet beach, on the Western Bay Road made of cement.</p>
<p>That's right, I will never interrupt, in Macau, no matter what day and night, when people are intoxicated in the fiery circle. A few of us, who are young wanderers who are restless at home, began to silently seek a little taste of life that is left over in the realm of poetry. Every day is like this, but what answer to life do we get in the end? It is still the same indifferent! I often curse this contradiction in my own heart. But, forget it! I am such a wandering person! I can't blame myself, just as the beautiful silver waves can't always be as charming as they are at night.</p>
<p>Wandering on the flat and clear beach, the pale yellow street lights cast shadows from the dense and lush evergreen tree leaves, swaying non-stop. In the dark circles, we always often see pairs of men and women's shadows floating so intimately. - That's right, the night in Western Bay is the holy land of love! However, we don't care, and don't sneak a look, just like the Indian Asans in yellow uniforms who guard the night on the streets, we don't look much and slip away. And our purpose is to come to the beach to see the beautiful silver waves!</p>
<p>The silver waves are spreading out on the vast sea. Our eyeballs move with each wave, yes, we can believe that it is the shadow of melted silver! However, when the silver waves roll from the sea to the land, after a rustling sound, we can't see any shadow at all, only the ground is so wet, like after a heavy rain.</p>
<p>The wind blowing from the sea is so cool! When our legs are a little sore, Macau has returned to a quiet sleeping village. At this time, we have to return silently again, to a simple home for wanderers.</p>

<p>Miss Lvyin told people that she would never run a radio station, but now she is seen at the radio station singing Millennial Love for the Meiling Singing Society. This broadcast is broadcast by Huahua Silk Company.</p>
<p>Mr. Qian Nailiang, a reporter from the World Morning Post Broadcasting Troupe, said that Miss Jin Yi's business card smells fragrant when it is taken out, which is truly what is called powdering on a business card in the new era.</p>
<p>According to Xu Qi, the president of Qiyin Society, the Shi Shi Xin Bao Broadcasting Machine will be cancelled in the future, and the broadcasting news will be taken care of by the Shen Bao. I wonder if this news is reliable? (I don't seem to have heard this news, editor)</p>
<p>The preparatory meeting for welcoming Malaysian athletes was held on the previous day (30th) at 4:30 PM, with Mr. Li Dachao as the chairman, and 72 groups attended.</p>
<p>Miss Liying came to the Business Society, bringing many of her own photos, triumphantly, but she always refused to give them to others, it turned out that she wanted to send them to someone.</p>
<p>Hongxia Company held a fashion show at the Dashanghai Ballroom one day, with Miss Bai Xue Zhu Huizhen and others singing, and the fashion show of eight famous ladies, including Xin Lijun Wang Ailili Meiqin Xia Yunxian Xia Yan Dai Caizhen Ye Lili Wang Qinna.</p>
<p>The business of Miss Jin Yikun and Miss Ying, the presidents of the Bai Lemon and Rongge Societies, is all handled by the ladies, which can be called a new era in the singing world for the ladies' singing.</p>
<p>If people from all walks of life want the jade photos of the ladies, they can send letters to the Daguanming Photo Studio on the fifth floor of the Daidong Hotel, and the letter will be attached with seven cents of postage, and it can also be signed by the person himself. (The above is in black)</p>
<p>Seeing in your esteemed journal on the 1st, "Mr. Lei"'s "Chen Jingfang Married an Old Man as a Concubine", the content is inconsistent with the facts. The news published in the Shi Shi Xin Bao Broadcasting Machine was also submitted by me. If you don't believe it, you can read the newspaper to see if the name is the same, which can prove it. Because it is related to reputation, I hereby send a letter to correct it and ask for peace on soft feet.</p>
<p>Today, the Traffic Radio Station (1300) will be taught by Mr. Dai Manru of the Yisheng Music Research Society from 5:30 PM to 6:00 PM.

<h3>Recent News of the New Era</h3>
<p>— Zhong</p>
<p>There is a role of local tyrants and evil gentry in "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside". After a long search, it was decided to borrow You Guangzhao from the Star Company to play the role. The fat man wearing a robe and putting on a mustache is very funny.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" is a sound-on-film singing giant film. After working hard day and night, more than half of it has been filmed. Last night, the filmed film was previewed, and the light, sound, and acting skills were said to have amazing results.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Tang Jie Xiao A Yuan Huang Naishuang went to Baidai Company yesterday at the invitation of the company to record "Singing Yangko" records. It is said that the work went smoothly and the results were gratifying. It is expected that the record will be popular throughout the country after its release.</p>
<p>Xiao Chen Cao Xuesong has put down his pen for a long time. Recently, he wrote a long novel on a whim in addition to filming, entitled "Two Orphans at the End of the World", which is 50,000 words long. It is said that it will be published in installments in the Women's Monthly starting from this month.</p>
<h3>Newcomer Introduction</h3>
<p>— Qingyun</p>
<p>Zhang Wen, a nineteen-year-old girl, has youth and energetic spirit, medium length, a healthy and beautiful physique,嘉寳-style long, unpermed hair like dark clouds, flexible eyes... Everything contains the conditions for the beauty of a modern girl. Friends, I tell you, she is the first one admitted among the hundreds of girls who applied for actresses in the spring of 1935 by Yihua Company, and she is also one of the most promising newcomers in the 1935 film industry.</p>
<p>She was originally from Jiaxing and lived in Hangzhou Municipal Middle School for several years. Therefore, she can read newspapers and write ordinary letters and articles. Because of her usual love for the emerging art of film, she broke through the fence built by her parents' corrupt ideas that she was not allowed to be a film actress, and came to her sister's house in Shanghai alone with a hopeful heart. Finally, her ideal was realized. In the chance encounter of Yihua's recruitment of actresses, under her artistic cultivation and all the conditions suitable for the screen, she became a member of the basic actresses of Yihua Company.</p>
<p>Although her ideal has been achieved, when her parents heard that she had entered the film industry, under the old thought that "actors are not good things at all", they believed that their daughter's entry into the film industry was a disgrace to the family, so they implemented their first step to force her to withdraw from the film industry by not providing living expenses. If she still stubbornly persists, then</p>
<p>However, Miss Zhang, who loves the emerging art of film very much, is willing to sacrifice everything to be a loyal warrior of film culture. In "At the Beginning of Man", she has already realized her ambition to appear on the screen, playing a "boat girl". Although there are not many shots, she performed well. Now, in the sound film "Storm", which is about to be released, she plays a female nurse. In the sound film "Hero of the Times" directed by Ying Yunwei, she plays the sister of a poor middle-aged man. We predict that judging from her spirit of striving for progress, she will never disappoint us.</p>
