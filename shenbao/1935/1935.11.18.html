<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c13">國民大會代表採職業代表制之準備 <a href="#c13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— 年</p>
<p>五全大會日前通過政治組審查報告。將國民大會代表採用職業代表制之審查意見。交中央執行委員會。此雖與建國大綱第十四條之所規定有所出入。而與孫中山先生十二年北上時主張。召集國民會議預備會議之辦法。却頗能吻合蓋中山先生主張。以（一）現代實業團體（二）商會（三）敎育會（四）大學（五）各省學生聯合會（六）工會（七）農會……等代表。在織國民會議預備會。已具有以職業代表决定國家重大問題之意矣。</p>
<p>職業代表制之被採用。為歐戰後各國代議制度改造中之重要發展。其動機在增進經濟問題在國家政務中之地位。而令生產階級在國家機關中占一特殊地位。藉以變更舊式的用人口及地域為選舉標準之代議制度。其原動力則為戰後社會主義之狂潮。此制對於戰後各國新製之憲法。給與甚大之影響。在我國十一年八月上海國是會議所起草之憲法草案。及以後草成各憲法稿。亦多參用之。不能謂為無相當之歷史關係也。</p>
<p>國民大會在五權憲法上之地位。與各國之代議機關似同而實異。憲法學者金鳴盛君曾舉出四點。（一）為民權之代行機關。與英國巴力門之主權代行機關者異。（二）為四權之代行機關。與蘇聯蘇維埃大會之為最高權力機關者異。（三）為政府以外之監政機關。與美國國會之為與政府並立者異。（四）為五院政府責任所從出之機關。自身並非純粹之立法機關。與法國議會之性質亦異。使金君此項解釋而果為確適。則國民大會之不適於以人口地域為標準之選舉制度。而應採職業代表制。似可無議也。</p>
<p>惟是職業代表制在各國憲法上。多係被兼採。在中國雖有文字上之歷史關係。尙未有實際採用之經騐。因是　人對於今後採用此制之準備。不可不有所注意。中國各職業團體之組織。未能普遍的充分的謂為已達健全程度。欲使其舉出代表而勝担任組織國民大會之重荷。除中央民衆運動指導委員會應加緊進行其工作外。各職業團體自身亦不可不有甚大之努力。此其一。論職業代表制之流弊者。謂以各職業團體代表討論關於經濟政治問題。因其利害不同。主張頗難一致。有誘起互相爭鬥之危機。其言亦非無理。初次探用職業代表制之時。如何事先注意。使此項流弊不致發生。此其二。各國對於職業代表制甚少直接單純採用者。其故因此制經濟的意義較為重大。對於普通政治則尙有問題。今中國以如何之辦法運用之。目前尙不能明知。惟如何使職業代表適應於普通政治之參加。則亦為須注意者此其三。</p>
<p>以上並非對於國民大會採用職業代表制之全般討論。惟一議之行事前準備。實所需要。盡其利而袪其弊。尤為創始新制度時之所應顧念。我當局及國人其如何以準備此職業代表新制之實行乎。</p>

<p>北碚參觀記（下）</p>
<p>四、中國西部科學院　該院於民國十九年秋成立、爲盧作孚氏所一手創辦、另組董事會、由現任四川省府主席劉湘任董事長、院長爲盧作孚氏、院中設生物、理化、農林、地質四研究所、生物研究所、下設有植物園及動物園、植物園內有菓苗百餘種、計六千餘株、苗圃地約二十餘畝、林木苗種一百餘種、計三十餘萬株、百合科、蘭科、球根八千餘株、動物園有熊、虎、豹、狐等數十種、豹原有二頭、每頭日食牛肉五斤、現爲省費起見、留養一頭、另一頭槍斃後做標本、陳列於博物館、均附設在平民公園內、每日遊覽者頗多、研究所主要研究工作爲採集中國西部各省之動植物及昆虫標本、總計有植物標本一萬一千七百九十九號五萬餘份、又向各研究機關換得中國各省區植物標本五千七百四十份、動物標本共有二千二百六十號、昆虫標本三萬餘號、</p>
<p>理化研究所之主要工作在採集並徵求各地礦產及工業原料樣品從事化騐、過去曾搜集嘉陸江及川東川鄂邊境各地煤礦二百五十八種、其他礦石一百四十餘種加以化騐、製成煤炭化騐總報吿、列爲該所出版叢刊之一、</p>
<p>農林研究所設於江北東陽鎭上壩、有農塲二區、一在東陽鎮、面積一百十六畝、一在西山坪、面積二千五百餘畝、係由荒地開墾而成、聞東陽鎭農塲爲菜蔬、園藝、果樹育苗及農作物、試騐之用、西山坪農塲爲森林、果樹、農作及畜牧之用、惜因下雨、未能前往一觀、</p>
<p>地質研究所於民國二十一年正式成立、主要工作爲調查川省地質、現已調查者爲江北、隣永、大竹、渠縣、廣安、合川、潼南、銅梁、璧山、永川等縣、編有重慶南川間地質誌及四川嘉陵三峽地質誌、現已出版、</p>
<p>除以上四大研究事業外、尙有附設事業三、（一）博物館、（二）公共圖書館、（三）兼善學校、博物館設於北碚平民公園內、民國十九年正式成立、內分陳列室動物園兩部、並附設合川科學館、經費每月經常費約四百元、陳列室分風物、衛生、煤礦、峽區物產、貨幣、工業美術各部、分設在北碚平民公園、地方醫院、合川科學館及北碚市各茶社、計陳列品有三千四百九十餘件、各地風景照片一千餘張、其中以風物陳列室最有研究價値、尤以西康風物爲多、大部係該館職員、親赴西康採集而來、內陳西康佛像多幅、據該館中人云、西康人甚信佛、每飯必供佛、且以佛像隨身帶、又西康人多不識字、官廳所用之「馬牌」（與現今通用之文書略同）、如令地方官吏供應牛馬、則於馬牌上、畫牛幾頭、馬幾頭、常地官吏即如動撥給、動物園設在手民公園內、供衆觀覽、公共圖書館內有書藉一萬六千餘冊、雜誌百四十餘種、報紙二十餘種、內有閱覽室一、參攷室四、事門研究藏書室一、現代知識展覽會四、其中以現代知識展覽會、最引人注意、因以圖畫及簡單文學之表示、可使觀衆知中國弱點所在、</p>
<p>兼善學校亦於民國十九年創辦、分初級中學及小學兩部、人數約二百左右、環境雖好、惟因經費困雖、頗難發展、</p>
<p>五、三峽染織工廠北碚區之經濟建設事業、有三峽染織工廠、北川鐵路公司、天府煤礦公司、齊源煤礦公司、燧川煤礦公司、嘉陵煤球廠、霍胥洞水電廠、自然電池廠、富源水電廠、金剛碑鍊鋼廠、富華鐵廠、盛敬之鐵廠、惠利火柴廠、洪濟造冰廠、利華玻璃廠等、規模除三峽染工廠、天府煤礦公司較大外、其餘均甚少、有的資本僅五千元、煤礦開採亦多用舊法、記者爲時間所限、僅參觀三峽染織工廠、北川鐵路、天府煤礦公司、嘉陵煤球廠四處、三峽染織工廠在峽防局附近、原屬峽防局、十九年秋、改組獨立、全廠有固定資產十萬九千三百元、流動資產八萬七千元、內設動力、漿漂、搖紗、織造四部、工人有男工百零六人、女工八十四人、一部尙係用手工機械織造、出品有各色峽呢、羅甫呢、自由呢、中山呢、充毛呢、毛巾布、蜂窩布等種、銷行重慶、成都、叙府、滬州、廣安、順慶、合川、北碚各地、價格較諸上海各廠出品爲貴、工人每日平均工作時間約十二小時、工資自一角至三角不等、　一內空氣流通、尙合衛生、</p>
<p>六、北川鐵路北川鐵路爲四川僅有的輕便鐵路、全綫長三十餘里、於民國十七年開始建築、十八年十月由水嵐堊至土地堊一段、開始通車、全部工程均爲丹麥工程師守兒茲所主持、鐵路起點在嘉陵江邊依山巓斷岩而築、乘船經過時、有時可聞汽笛嗚嗚之聲、如在船中伸首仰望、則見火車一列、盤旋天際、如在車中俯瞰、則又下臨無地、使人心惴、記者曾乘北川鐵、路車來回一次、見路軌敷設、較普通鐵路爲狹車行頗慢、顚簸較平常客車爲甚、蓋該鐵路係輕便鐵路、其建築之主要目的、爲運輸煤炭·每年可獲盈餘一萬七千餘元、</p>
<p>七、天府煤礦公司該公司聞係由舊有各小廠合併而成、現有資本二十四萬元、一部爲舊有各廠合併的廠價、一部爲新集的股本、礦區約十五里、由麻柳灣至戴家溝一帶的礦區、皆爲該公司所有、據該公司工程師閔君語記者、本公司因開採仍用土法、銷路不廣、現尙虧本、本公司原有工廠六、現繼續開工者僅四廠、原因係（一）供給過於需求、（二）其他二廠出產、成本過高、本公司煤區可分二種、（一）·二疊紀、長在石灰崖內、煤層最厚者達一丈五、可練焦（全川出產之煤，僅江北、南川、彭縣三縣可鍊焦）、但二疊紀煤質不佳、不能用諸輪船、（二）侏羅紀、通地皆是、煤層最厚者約一尺半、產在沙崖內、質甚佳、現本公司每天可出煤三百噸、每噸價格泡塊炭六元、硬塊五元、泡子四元、硬子三元五角、但以上僅係白廟子站價格過站每噸約需加運費八元、本公司有直接工人三百餘、連間接工人合計、約二千餘人云、白廟子煤礦除天府以外、尙有三才生合股公司、組織很舊式、有資本二十萬、亦虧本、原因亦係採法不良、運輸成本過大、現則惟有竭力緊縮、以圖生存、</p>
<p>記者在北碚及溫泉公園兩地逗留四日、見聞所及、覺北碚區之自治精神、與人才練訓兩點、頗足爲他省鄉村建設的借鏡、但生產方法之現代化、却是北碚乃至四川全省目前亟亟之圖、</p>

<h3 id="c64">國聯制裁的性質 <a href="#c64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— 昂若</p>
<p>國職對意經濟制裁，如無其他變化，將於本月十八日開始實行。這是一九二〇年一月十六日國聯成立以來的創舉，也是集體行動懲戒戎首的先例。不過制裁問題非常複雜，曾引起一般人錯誤的觀念。茲將制裁的性質和實行上的法律根據分析如下。</p>
<p>「制裁」是法律的名辭，就是强制犯法者服從法律的意思。法律的精神，在使制裁經過適當的審詢後，用大衆的權力來實行，而不能由一個人擅自施行。這種法治的情形，在國際方面的與在國家範圍之內的不同之點，在於國際方面沒有像國法一類嚴格的法典。在國際方面，一九二〇年以來，法治之義有二，即（一）遵守國際條約，（二）朋與國間的任何爭端應由協定或別種合法手續解决，而不應從事於戰爭。這些原則都載在國聯盟約，簽字於盟約的會員國都有實行這些原則的責任。</p>
<p>但盟約於載明這些原則外，還有更進一步的規定。盟約第十條，第十一條，第十三條，第四項，第十五條第六第七項，和第十六條規定國聯應行制止意圖或實際違反盟約者的辦法</p>
<p>第十條規定，「國聯會會員祖任尊重並保持所有國聯會各會員的領土完整，及現有的政治獨立，以防禦外來的侵犯。如遇此種侵犯或有此種侵犯之任何威嚇或危險之虞時，理事會應籌履行此項義務的方法。」這是概括的行於侵犯威嚇與實際侵犯的條文。對於任何特別案件採用何種方法則由理事會籌畫。理事會建議採用，第十六條規定的制裁的若干部或全部，均無不可。惟關於本條和其他條文之無別種明文規定者（如第十五條第六第七項，與第十六條），國聯理事會的决議必須全體一致。</p>
<p>第十六條規定制裁戎首的實行方法，實行的條件是一國「不顧盟約第十二條，第十三條，或第十五條而從事戰爭，據此事實，應即視爲對於所有國聯其他會員有戰爭行爲，其他各會員祖任立即加以」明文規定的制裁。惟欲實行第十六條，必須在戰爭確巳發生之後。</p>
<p>至於第十條與第十一條則准許戰事之危險以及戰爭已經開火之時實行，並無明文規定的辦法。第十條已經討論過。第十一條聲明任何戰爭或戰爭之危險皆爲國聯全體之事，「國聯會應用任何明快的辦法以保持各國的和平。」條文甚屬寬泛，十三國委員會法律組在它的報吿書中引證一九二七年理事會委員會的意見，「准許採用戰爭以外的任何辦法對付頑强的國家。」據該法律組的意見，根據本條，而採用的任何辦法應屬防範性質。再關於此事，如無特約，各國在法律上沒有服從理事會建議的義務。本條的辦法，因與第十六條的不同，第十六條規定，如有違反盟約而從事戰爭的，即應對違約國實行制裁。</p>
<p>依據第十三條第四項，理事會如遇一國未能實行裁决，「應擬辦法使生效力。」據法律組的意見，根據本條實行的任何辦法須以達到這個目的爲限。</p>
<p>第十五條第六第七兩項所規定的是消極的制裁，就是理事會建議書，除相爭之一造或一造以上的代表外，該會理事一致贊成，則國聯會會員約定「彼此不得向遵從建議書的任何一造從事戰爭。」</p>
<p>在研究制栽的解釋和實行的困難問題之前，應將各種制栽的性質加以分析。制裁可分四類，（一）道德的與外交的辦法，（二）財政的與經濟的辦法，（三）國際抵制，（四）軍事辦法。上述四類制栽中有一重要的鴻溝，即違約國對付前兩種辦法不致牽涉戰鬥行爲，但如積極抵抗後兩種辦法，則一定引起戰爭。這點容後再詳加檢討。</p>
<p>輿論爲道德的制裁之一種，定能發生相當的力量。侵略國內部的輿論或許給政府的宣傳所蒙蔽，世界一致反對侵略國的公意是不能完全抹煞的。信用須靠信任，信任會給國外的貶辭所打擊。但輿論如無具體的行動爲後盾，也難有效。具體的行動或從外交途徑表現，如警告抗議，撤退外交代表，與斷絕外交關係之類。這些辦法有利亦有弊。此外還有不承認的辦法，（如一九三二年一月七日美國外長史汀生關於滿洲問題的對日照會，及同年三月十一日國聯大會通過的决議）。</p>
<p>第二類的財政和經濟制裁，程　有輕重不同。財政制裁有三種方式即停止長期借欵，短期銀行信用借欵，及商業賖賬。財政制裁，行之得時，可生效力，並且輕而易舉，對於施行的國家，沒有廣大的影響，但也有弱點。被制裁國可藉以取消外債，以資報復。此外還有對被侵略國給予財政援助的辦法。財政援助公約曾於一九三〇年成立，（已經簽字的國家有英，比，法，德，意，波蘭，西班牙，小恊約國和斯干狄那維亞各國等三十國，）但還沒有實行過。這公約如屬有效，被侵略的國家有機會得着國聯其他會員國財政上的援助，侵略國就不免三思而後行。</p>
<p>討論經濟制裁之前，應將消極的與挑戰的辦法予以檢別。國聯可以建議，禁止軍事用品和軍需原料出口。全體會員國可以一致贊同在本國　內實行禁止。但是不屬國聯的軍需出產國苟不一致行動，禁止就不能澈底。在這種情形之下，國聯不得不决定是否實行封鎖，而侵略國如欲衝破這種封鎖，就不免引起戰爭，甚國至與非會員也有發生糾紛的可能。</p>
<p>惟在實行封鎖的嚴峻辦法之前、還有許多辦法可行。許多國家一致抵制侵略國的貨物可生重大的影響，在實行制裁國禁止輸入比較禁止輸出易於舉辦。行政方面，檢定貨物的來源也比檢定目的地輕便，無須封鎖就可辦妥，它的力量足使侵略國失去外滙—這種損失的本身很屬嚴重，並且足以妨害侵略國向別的方面購貨。</p>
<p>至於禁止輸出，最應舉辦的當然是軍器，軍火，和軍需。實行上已有相當困難。第一，指定眞正戎首一向很難得着同意，這也是制栽全部問題的癥結，第二，對於相爭的兩造應否同行禁止，向來也各執一辭。例如對中日問題，英國發起對兩造同禁，其他國家並不贊同，禁令實行不過二星期就取消了。在意阿爭端中，若干國家對兩造同禁。國聯大會於十月九日通過對意制栽案後，會員國已有五十國取消對阿禁令了。</p>
<p>禁止軍用品是否有效全視被制裁國是否是生產國，以及禁止是否有隙漏，不屬國聯的生產國的態度亦甚重要。對生產及高度工業國須同時禁止主要原料方才有效。惟蓄意侵略的國家一定早把這類原料積藏了。不過現在日趨於專門化和機械化的時代，一國的軍力，也日趨於依賴各種商品。所以經濟制裁的效力也很可觀的。</p>
<p>現在再將盟的第十六條所規定的制裁加以研究，就是關於第十六條第一項所載的國際抵制及第二第三兩項所載的軍事制栽。本條的解釋，後面再討論。現在先研究它的辦法。最要注意的一點就是必須有一國已經不顧盟約而從事戰爭之後，才可以實行第十六條。</p>
<p>遇着這種情形，「即視爲對於所有國聯其他會員有戰爭行爲，其他各會員擔任立即與之斷絕各種商業上或財政上的關係，禁止其人民與破壞盟約國人民的各種往來，並阻止其他任何一國爲國聯會會員或非會員的人民與該國的人民財政上商業上或僩人上的往來。」</p>
<p>國際抵制，如能迎合盟約起草人的初衷而普遍的實行，那一定有效，如遇被制裁國抵抗，各國準備，以封鎖或軍事行動爲後盾，效力之大更不必說。關於這點，不屬國聯的大國很處重要的地位。即是要國聯會員一致實行國際抵制，也不無疑問。依靠對外貿易的程度，各國不同，這種抵制的影響也隨之而異。况且一般人以爲沒有一國可以不受澈底抵制的損害的。</p>
<p>抵制如要完全有效，必須能把邊境完全封閉，一切郵電，航業，航空，都要斷絕，使領人員全體撤退，甚至於被抵制國家的僑民也要幽禁或遣送回國。</p>
<p>實行這些辦法不免發生若干問題。被制裁國的抵抗封鎖必引起軍事行動及戰鬥步驟，非國聯會員國的態度必須考慮。此外，昆鄰的國家，尤其是弱小的國家，處境必很困難，必須想特別辦法保障它們的地位，使它們免於參加抵制或者保護它們的國防。還有補償的問題。抵制的損害不同，損害輕的國家應補償損害重的。關於這點，第十六條第三項規定着，『國聯會員約定，當按照本條適用財政上及經濟上應採的辦法時，彼此互相抉助，使因此所致的損失與困難减至最少之點。』</p>
<p>第十六條第二項規定，『遇此情形，理事會應負向關係各政府建議的責任，俾國聯各會員出陸海空軍實力，組成軍隊，以維護國聯盟約的實行。』據第三項，國聯會員國復約定，」如破壞盟約國對於國聯中一會員施行任何特殊辦法，亦應互相扶助，以抵制之，其恊同維護國聯盟約的國聯任何會員之軍隊應取必要方法，予以假遒的便利」。</p>
<p>實際上，軍事辦法如何實行並沒有明文規定。在某種事件，國聯理事會得指定一國或數國採取海陸空軍事行動。理事會也可建議會員各國派遣軍隊編成一種國聯軍，這種國際軍隊的自動應徵不免躭誤時機，最高指揮權的指定也是棘手的問題。由國聯主持編練國際警備隊已經某某數國發起過，但離成熟時期尙遠。</p>
<p>職是之故，軍事裁制辦法須視每種事件的特殊情形而定，地理的環境尤爲重要的因素。實際上，若干國家會不限於盟約第十六條的規定，而自捲入戰爭漩渦，不得不立竭全力以應付的。</p>
<p>第十六條的實行與國聯會員國的權利義務曾引起重要的解釋問題。關於這點，法學家的意見也常不一致。不過一九二一年十月國聯第二屆大會迭次的决議可爲依據。第一决議規定「盟約是否已被破壞應由國聯會員國各自决定」，其意謂第十六條的實行係自動的，即一國不顧盟約而從事於戰爭，而每個國聯會員國巳自行確定這種事實，這會員國即有採取軍事行動之責，惟這責任並不是强迫的。第四决議載稱、『國聯會員國有依據盟約的明文規定履行第十六條的義務，如有疎忽，即應視爲違反條約。』但是，如有一國已經决定盟約並未破壞，國聯理事會的建議就無效，就不能强迫這個國家施行制裁了。</p>
<p>第五决議規定，第十六條下的任何破壞盟約案『應由國聯任何會昌國的申請，提交理事會緊急處置。』秘書長應即通吿全體理事，及早召集會議，研究案情，並提出建議。如理事會以爲盟約已被破壞，則根據第六决議，議事錄應交國聯全體會員，並須附以理由書與採取行動的通知書。其他决議規定，理事會得組專家委員會襄助辦理，理事會應建議開始實行第十六條經濟制裁的日期，並負通告全體會員之責。經濟制裁如延長實行時間，則須採取逐步嚴峻的辦法，禁止食糧供給爲饅後一步，並須設法使不屬國聯的國家合作。</p>
<p>這些决議的重要性在於明白規定不干涉國家主權，制栽行動是共同的，不是單獨的，第十六條所規定的辦法毋須立刻同時實行，而可分期辦理的。</p>
<p>關於經濟制栽的解釋，專家的意見還有一點不同，一方面以爲第十六條的經濟制裁須對違約國及其人民實行完全抵制，這種抵制須是消極的，各國限於停止一切來往，但又須是積極的，各國應積極禁止違約國與任何會昌國與非會員國的來往。</p>
<p>另一方面的意見，以凱洛格非戰公約爲根據，以爲第十六條規定的經濟制裁祗須各會員國在它自己的領土內實行。國聯會員國並不負國境以外行動與實行封鎖的責任。不過關於這點，須各國都能在它們自己的領土內實行，抵制才能有效，這是很顯明的。</p>
<p>制裁成功的關鍵在於國聯會昌國集中全力對付侵略國。盟約起草人的思想以爲國聯是一個全世界的相織，以全世界的力量對付一個侵略國，必能使之就範。惟如英外相霍爾於九月十一日在日內瓦所稱，國聯自始即缺少某某幾個大國爲會員，此後復有其他國家退出，不過盟約的責任仍舊存在，而留在國聯裏的國家的負担因之大大的加重了。</p>

<p>— 中央軍官學校敎官　稈祥榮</p>
<p>（一）科學是什麼？科學這個名辭就是英文的Science或德文的Wisehedchaft個若依照廣義的解釋，科學應當包括精神科學（即社會學，史學，法學，和經濟學等）和自然科學，但一般人所謂科學是依照狹義解釋的，其內容僅限於自然科學。</p>
<p>自然科學以自然物和自然現象為其研　對象，凡生理學，地質學，天文學，以及物理化學等都是自然科學，至於數學，雖與自然科學具有密切關係，但在嚴格的科學分類上，數學並不屬於自然科學。</p>
<p>十八世紀，法國數理哲學家達蘭培氏（d'Alembert）編輯百科全書的時候，曾經把數畢歸類於自然科學的當中，然其後的學者如馮德氏（Wundt）就把數學和自然科學分離開了。</p>
<p>數學是抽象的形式科學，自然科學郤是經騐的實質科學，其本質是互相對立而不能相屬的，自然科學是研究客觀的經騐內容，數學則不受經騐的拘束，例如虛數或複素數在經騐的尋常事物的計算上面是沒有什麼用處的，又如四次元或五次元空間亦决非吾人經騐的空間。</p>
<p>自然科學尤其是物理學的研究必須依賴數學，愛因斯坦氏（Einstien）的相對性理論依賴高等數字的進步方纔得到成功的結果，但相對性理論的根據是在於經騐的實在，决非全憑數式的演繹；其他如天文學和理論化學的研究，數學是不可缺少的研究法，但其學問的本質，却和數學是完全獨立的。總之，自然科學是客觀的經騐的科學，而數學對於經騐却是超然無關的，二者當然不能混合而談。</p>
<p>（二）科學的本質人類對於自然有二種欲望：一為對於自然的神秘希望探明其究竟；一為對於日常生活希望利用自然，因為要滿足這兩種欲望，就從各方面研究自然物和各種自然現象，如此漸將斷片的知識積集起來加以整理和考證，遂漸發明普遍的因果關係，就得以成立了科學。在科學成立的路徑上有一條狠重要的原則，這原則就是：由事實的確認以求說明事實，倘若吾人豫定的理論是和事實相反的，則此種不合於事實的理論，即當推翻。</p>
<p>上述尊重事實的思想早巳淵源於希臘哲學時代，而其成熟，則直至近世科學發達的時期方纔實現。如何可以確認事實，？其主要方法即為觀察和實騐，觀察（Obserrvation）即對於自然現象加以人為的注意而獲得正確的經騐，實騐（Experiment）即對於自然現象以人為的方法將複雜的現象變作較為簡單，然後加以分析而判明事實的眞相。凡研究科學者皆知觀察和實騐的重要，假若沒有精密的觀察和實騐的方法，自然科學是决不會進步的；換言之觀察和實騐的方法，逐漸改良，其精密的程度亦逐漸增進，於是科學方纔發達起來的。故吾人欲明科學的本質或科學特徵，首當舉述觀察和實騐。</p>
<p>抑又有言者欲明科學的本質當由其方法上加以考察，試簡述之，科學的方法可分為（一）記述和分類，（二）由特殊專例歸納為普通的必然的法具，（三）對於生物現象須認識目的性，記述（Cassification）和分類（Ciarafioation）是動植物學礦物學以及化學上許多地方常用的方法，把類似的自然物綜合於其一種類概念的底下，這方法是呌做「分類」分析各類的特徵而將其表示出來，這方法就呌做「記述」記述和分類必須探究對象的主要屬性（Essention　propertion）以作分類的基礎而其探究的手叚即依賴觀察和實騐；故若無精密的觀察和實騐，則記述或分類皆不能正確。設立法則為自然科學究竟的目標，所謂「法則」（Law）必須具有超越時間空間的普遍性和必然性，例如物理學上牛頓（Nawton）的萬有引力法則和化學上門特萊夫（Mendelieff）的週期律都是普遍的必然的法則，考其成立係歸納種種特殊經騐並經檢證（Verificertion）然其根據當然仍為觀察和實騐的結果，到後來由進步的觀察和實騐得新的事實，則萬有引力和週期律等類的法則亦須加以修正了。至於生物現象不能純由因果法則說明，故對於生物全般的研究，不能一如物理化學專討論機械的因果關係，因生物現象必須由因果關係之外更透視其目的和手段究為如何，即就達爾文（Darwin）的進化論而言，所謂「自然淘汰」或「適者生存」等類的原理亦非僅指因果關係而含有若干目的論的成分；然而無論如何，生物現象的研究决非憑空構想，其根據亦必在於正確的觀察和實騐。</p>
<p>總之，自然科學起源於人類的求知慾和利用慾，而自然科學的發達和進步，則全然依賴於觀察和實騐法的精確；吾人為了解科學的本質，固然應當要明白這個道理的，</p>
<p>（三）科學對於現代思潮的影響科學對於現代人的思想有深刻的影響，故科學和現代各種派別的思潮都有密切的關係，茲僅就唯心論和唯物論的兩方面以考察科學對於思想界的影響</p>
<p>唯心論以心靈為最高的論據，人類最原始而且最占勢力的唯心論當推宗敎。在科學幼稺的時代宗敎逞其信仰上的權威，常常壓迫科學，歐洲基督敎的羅馬法皇對於地動說目為異端邪說，曾經加以嚴厲的處罰和干涉，伽利賴氏Galilei）由星辰的觀測而主張地動說的正確，其著書却被禁止，併命本人宣誓自說的錯訛，至十九世紀達爾文所創生物進化論亦為宗敎家反對；然科學具有客觀的眞實性，任何壓迫不能損其毫末，故科學的勃興就使得宗敎的理論也不得不改革了。一方面對於科學本身亦覺應有反省的考察，科學固以客觀的經騐為對象，但經騐是什麼？吾人認識自然物和自然現象，全依吾人的五官的感覺（視，嗅，味，聽，觸，）那末感覺又是什麼呢？此等問題，使吾人對於「物」的本身以及科學的眞理皆引起反省的疑慮，故科學并非破壞唯心論，而是對於唯心論採取一種改進的批評的態度。皮爾遜氏（Pearson）曾經說過；科學的知識是由感覺的現實，加以思維上的整理，而綜合起來的。然則可知科學的眞理是吾人思維所形成的自然的模型；自然是全部的，整個的，而自然科學的種種的分科祗不過上述自然模型的各方面的橫斷面就是了。</p>
<p>唯物論以物質為唯一的議論根據，自然科學昌明，引起產業革命，於是由重農的社會變更為工業的社會，又由田園的生活一變而為集中都市的生活，遂使現代人醉心於唯物的思想。科學的根本在於發現普遍的必然的因果法則，對於一切自然現象决無所謂意志或精神作用，在科學家的眼光中祗認得物質於自然法則支配之下經過了種種變化而巳；故唯物的思想確與自然科學甚為接近，然唯物論是把『精神』也看做物的『實在』的，其主張本為形而上的學說，與經騐的自然科學械不相同。例如將來的生物學也許能够探究生物和精神作用的關係，而尋求其間所有的必然的法則，但自然科學的目的僅在於闡明事實，决不將精神作用隸屬於物質。此事正如物理事上研究物質和能（Energy）的關係，其目的祇求明白了物質的種種狀態和能相關的事實，并不考慮要把『能』隸屬於物質的，同時我們應注意自然科學的研究物質固然絕對着重物質本身的觀察和實騐，但亦留意於思考的正確和論證的完密，凡研究科學的人大概都知道在某種觀察和實騐之前，必先具有若干豫感（Hait），這種豫感，雖未必正確，然而豫感對於研究的能否成功却是具有重大關係的，總之科學雖絕對注重物質，但亦絕對不是形而上的唯物論。</p>
<p>由上所述，可見科學對於單純的唯心論以及形而上的機械的唯物論部給予很深的影響，使其不得不另行改芷，近代哲學界的批判哲學和直觀哲學以及關於生命論的種種思想，都是受着科學的洗禮而出現的。</p>
<p>（四）科學對於人生的貢獻吾人日常生活上衣食住行無論那一件，莫不依賴科學的發明，所以科學的功用是範圍很廣的，而科學對於人生的買獻是很偉大的。</p>
<p>人造絲合成染料的發明以及紡織機的進步使吾人衣類起了大改革；空中氣的固定，人造肥料的大量供給使農業起了變革而吾人食料亦賴進步的科學以受影響：水泥和鋼鐵工業的發達使建築界一變過去的風格，內燃機關和輕金囑的進步，使交通機關由火車而增加汽車飛機，這樣住和行的問題也和從前大不相同了。</p>
<p>科學的功用旣如此廣大，决不能一一枚舉，但有一根本問題必須注意者：即先有科學在理論上的發展，然後方發明種種應用，而科學對於吾人的貢獻僅在於如何順應自然，决不能利用科學以征服自然，試伸論之。</p>
<p>科學上或發見吾人平常不能感覺的事物，或發明平常被疏忽的因果關係，其究竟目的則在於闡明自然現象的眞理，固不問該現象是否有用的；然於研究眞理的途中往往發見有用的東西，這種發見是偶然的附帶的發見，換言之，科學决非為應用而研究，但於研究途中偶然遇着應用的問題就是了。例如在廣汎地研究電磁波理論的途中，偶然發見特異的X綫，當時并不注意牠的用處，後來漸漸知道X綫對於人體的生理具有重大的關係，於是日臻發達，到現在却在醫術上竟成為一個專科了。又如奧斯華特（Oowald）敎授是首創理論化學的學者，他在研究接觸作用的時候發明氤可以氧化而成硝酸，當時硝酸較氤更為廉價，這個發明是完全沒有用處的，不過在理論上却是很有價値就是了；那知道後來哈援氏（Haber）又發明利用空中氮可以合成氧，於是就應用從前奧斯華特敎授的發見，得以由空中氮間接製造硝酸，其用途大為昌明，遂使歐戰中被封鎖的德國不憂火藥製造原料的缺乏。試將現在應用的各種科學問題，尋其原委而加以考察，則如上例所述者殆不可勝計，可知一切應用科學都是產生在理論之後的。</p>
<p>原始時代的人類往往受了天災地變的自然的脅迫，故對於自然常懷抱恐怖的觀念，迨至近代，人類利用科學於日常生活以獲得自然的益利，一若自然可供吾人自由的驅使，而謂文明即為科學征服自然的結果。此種見解實在是錯誤的，我們不可不加以省察。利用自然决不是征服自然，因為自然現象具有一定的必然的法則，凡一切自然界所生起的事實，都是依照這些法則的，人類何能干涉自然或是去征服自然呢。我們祇能毅研究自然現象的法則，因而明白其因果關係，併得以豫測其應當生起的現象，譬如氣象學因各地關於氣溫和氣壓的觀察甚為精密，於是可以豫知某地於某時應有狂風雨，但無論氣象舉如何進步，决不能干涉自然，决不能阻止狂風雨的發生。又吾入製造機器以利用自然，其原則祇不過變更物體的接觸和配置，因而使其適合於某種自然法則的實現而已；譬如一切動力機械，均於自然法則之下，將熱能變成工作，香人决不能無燃料而使機械動作，科學功用僅可極力節省燃料，使其中所含蓄的勢能儘量變成工作。如上如述，可知並非人類征服自然，人類僅由科學的發達，極力順應自然而已。（完）</p>

<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>（二十四年十一月於上海）</p>
<p>——謹獻於中國國民黨第五次全國代表大會諸同志和好談政制改革的先生們—</p>
<p>可是，訓政精神儘管求其貫澈，而憲法草茶却也不妨先事議訂。何以故？議訂憲草是一事，施行憲法又是一事。議訂不妨其早，為的是要便於宣傳，利於研討；施行不妨其遲，為的是要斟酌盡當，不悖國情。建國大綱第二十二條明白規定：「憲法草案當本於建國大綱，及「訓政」憲政」兩時期之成績，山立法院議訂，隨時宣傳於民衆，以備到時採擇施行」。可見議訂是第一步，宣傳是第二步，採擇是第三步，施行是第四步，亦即最後的一步。所尤可注意的，議訂　法草案乃在「訓政」時期和「憲政開始」時期之後，故一面努力訓政，使地方人民可以自治，為「憲政開始」打通一條大道，一面根據兩時期的經騐，草擬憲法草案，實在不是一件矛盾的事。有些人以為憲法是和訓政抵觸的，也有些人以為憲法一經議訂，便須立刻頒布，一經頒布，便須立刻施行：這都是拘泥固執的一孔之見。</p>
<p>這幾年以來政治舞台的敗象，在於機關多而系統不明，委員多而責任不負，以致雖有疊床架屋的公署，滿坑滿谷的人員，曾無補於政治的推進，國難的輕减。故今後如果議訂一部富有訓政精神的憲法草案，首先要使憲法中所規定的政治機構（即政府組織）是一個嚴密而又靈活的組繳，系統務求分明，責任務求專一，要政府方面，確乎行使「治權」，總宜使那負行政責任的人有充分發抓才能的機會，加强其權力，不受過分的掣肘。但同時政府在執行政策的過程中，必須秉受以三民主義建國的國民黨的指導和監督，務求國策的决定，絕無違背三民主義的事實。必如是，國民革命為不虛；亦必如是，政制改革始不入於歧途。</p>
<p>國民黨在憲法初經頒布，憲政籌備開始的時候，旣然仍須代表着人民負起指導政府和監督政府的重大責任，換言之，在這個時期，我們假定可以稱為「黨和民同治時期」，作為由一「黨治」過渡到「民治」的一個階段，則在事實上國民黨還是在那裏代表着人民行使一部分的「政權」。國尺黨的責任既不容輕卸，自然應該先行檢點過去幾年中組繳欠缺的癥結所在，而作「自力更生」的企圖。第一，過去的黨沒有把黨員當做軍隊一般的訓練，以致組織鬆懈，紀律廢弛。第二，過去的黨沒有把政綱當做信條一般的實行，以致開出了支票不兌現，失信於人民。第三，過去的黨沒有把力量集中於一個領袖之下，以致各樹門戶，懷紛猜忌，適中挑撥離間者之計。第四，過去的黨沒有把貪污現象用全力來剷除，以致茫茫宦海，依然被烏姻瘴氣所籠罩，而使人民對於革命工作的認識變為模糊。總之，國民黨終究是一個最有歷史最有力量的黨，只要內部組繳改弦更張，感加嚴密起來，一革已往的弊病，自然可以負起指導政府監督政府的責任。國民黨的黨員應該有這種自信，只要當員們覺悟努力，嚴密組織，不但可以建國，一定可以洽國的。</p>
<p>上面旣把我所想到的政制改革的途徑·約略加以說明，現在就擬根據這些要點，寫出我所希望的憲法草案的主要輪廓，和國民黨總章修改的重要點於左，還請高明指敎！（未完）</p>

<p>各種出品製造法　該廠出品，共有七種，（一）中點，（二）西點，（三）麵包，（四）餅乾，（五）罐頭，（六）糖果，（七）陳皮梅，銷路甚廣，利息以罐頭與餅乾兩種為最厚，各項出品之製造法曁成分，大致如下，第一為原料部，共有一千二百種，分油料與香料兩類，其中三分之二為國產，三分之一係舶品，第二為中點製造部，多數係手工，用十分之四鷄蛋，十分之三麵粉，十分之二·五糖，十分之一·五發糕，配成各種中點食品，烘發而成，第三為西點製造部，用十分之二牛駱，十分之二麵粉，十分之四鷄蛋，及十分之二糖與發糕混合，製成各種西點，蒸發而成，第四為麵包製造部，先將麵粉及發糕和合，再經六小時之發酵，然後出焙爐烘焙而成，其工作時間，自下午七時起至翌晨二時止，每晨出品，以上日下午定貨之多寡為標準，第五為罐頭製造調味部，先將原料經過化驗室鑑定後，送入製造部滌洗，再行分別烹調裝罐，共有一百零五味，計分魚·肉·野味·蔬菜·水菓·等五類，第六為焊罐部，用以修焊各種罐頭，第七為器機部，用以修理各神機器，第八為機爐間，用以發動各部機器鍋爐，第九為機器製罐部，專門製造各種罐頭，所用鐵皮，完全從英美兩國買來，每箱兩百磅，計一百十二張，約値國幣四十元左右，此項罐頭製成後，尙須轉送抽空氣機及水汀缸消毒，方能應用，第十為餅乾製造部，共分五步工作，（甲）調和，即將十分之七麵粉，十分之二糖，十分之一發糕，混合後用機器調和，共有四十餘種，凡上等餅乾，採用外國料較多，約佔十分之四，中下等者較少，約占十分之一·五，（乙）軋皮，混合原料經過調和後，即轉入軋皮機，將原料軋成簿皮，同時再經過刷淸，（丙）打印，簿皮刷淸後，隨即經過打印機，將餅乾上面印成各種花紋，同時切成方塊，（丁）焙乾切成方塊後，立時送入四百五十溫度之焙爐，一面進一面出，滴合五分鐘之烘焙時間，於是成品，（戊）包裝，將烘乾之餅乾，送至包裝部，隨即裝包，或裝罐，此外如糖果及皮梅兩種，手續甚為簡單，糖果祗須將糖和花生瓜子肉或胡桃肉混合，切成方塊即得，陳皮梅祗須在靑梅上市時，收集多量靑梅，先用鹽醃過，經歷相當時期，再行晒乾，並敲碎，以便隨時加料製造各種皮梅。</p>
<p>特設化學化騐室　該廠為求各種出品，適合衛生條例起見，特在總廠內，設立化學化騐室，專門化騐各種原料及出品，有無其他不合衛生之毒質，尤其對於罐頭食品，如魚肉野味等　，格外注意。</p>
<p>營業槪況及其他　該廠資本五十萬元，歷年營業均佳，去年營業總額，竟達二百萬元之鉅，上海發行部，共有六處，代售處全國共一千三百餘所，每日採用鷄蛋五百磅，麵粉二百五十袋，（後新廠出品）全廠共有男工二百三十餘名，女工二百餘名，行施包工制，每一工人，每月所得約在十二三元左右，技術工頭，月薪亦有多至一百二十元者，該廠廠基佔十八畝餘，除自建各部廠屋辦公室及大廳外，並附建工人宿舍及工人家屬宿舍，以備全廠工人及家屬住居，租金每所每月僅收五元，故男女全體工人，　不稱便。</p>

<p>— 李俊思</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>桐油本為我國的特產，是油漆工業上不可或缺的原料。頻年以來，」方面由於向占全國出口貿易上重要位子的絲茶的逐步衰退，一方面亦由於世界各國需用桐油的迫切，所以桐油的輸出國外，突飛猛進，有極速的進展。尤其是近幾年來，其長足的進展，在國際貿易上，不但已與絲茶等物並駕齊驅，同列重要地位，並目廢駸乎有起而代之的趨勢。如民國二十二年度絲，茶，夏，桐油四種重要商品出口數量之總和爲一百八十萬零六千零三十三祖，而桐油出口數量爲一百二十四萬六千八百四十七担，占總數百分之六十九以上；在價値方面：四種重要商品出口植之總和為八千五百五十九萬四千九百二十二元，其中桐油之出口值爲三千零二十六萬一千二百六十九元，占總值百分之三十五以上。由此可見桐油的對外貿易，已不在絲茶之下了。這種現象，在每年鉅額的入超下，在各種商品對外貿易普遍地衰落聲中，未始不令人可喜而可作為一枝塡補一部分入超的及在國際貿易的爭戰上，它是否有永久保持勇往直前的可能性？無疑的，這些都是值得我們注意的問題·本文的任務，就是想對於這些問題，付以相當的檢視，以明白它的現狀和前途。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>在我們檢視桐油對外貿易的現狀之前，對於它的過去，不可不先加以簡單的回顧。</p>
<p>查我國桐油的對外開始貿易，為時尙在十九世紀中葉。當同治八年時，（一八六九年）就首先有桐油運往美國，不過那時輸出的數量甚少，價値亦低，所以未引起一般人之注意。但入後各國製漆業漸見發達，工業原料方面用途日廣，故至民國七年時，世界上銷納我國桐油的即有十六處，至民九擴充至十八處，截至前年，已有二十六國需用我國桐油，惟數量多寡不同而巳。如美國，香港，英國，荷蘭，丹麥，德國，法國，比利時，意大利，挪威，日本，以及澳洲，朝鮮，關東租借地，都是我國桐油輸出的主要國家。在這種情形下，桐油的國外市塲旣逐漸擴充，各國的需要量又日漸增加，桐油的對外輸出相對地隨之而增加，是必然的結果。所以我國的桐油對外貿易，呈着高速度的發展。如果以在價値方面呈着最高度的民國十九年的對外輸出，與同治年間的桐油輸出値相較，固不知已相差了多少倍，就是與民元的輸出値相較，亦已不可相提並論。我們看了下表，就可明白桐油輸出的遞增情形。在這表中，我們看到自民元來桐油的對外輸出，雖不是永久的保持着上漲的趨勢，而其間也有鉅額的差落，但我們如果試將它輸出國外的數量和價値自民元至民二十以五年為一期的將它的總和列出來，那麼，它迅速的進展，就可顯明的表演出來：</p>

<p>在上表中，我國又可看到桐油的輪出國外，自民國十五年起，在價値方面，呈着扶搖直上的趨勢。綜觀在這五年中，足足增加了一倍有餘。但自民二十年起，即張落靡定，遠不及十九年，原因是民二十年長江流域大水，產桐區域受着極大的影響，所以桐油的生產量銳減，在貿易方面，便露着陡落的情形；及至民二十一年，承着去年大水的餘禍，生產更見低落，貿易益發不振；直至二十二年入夏以後，因適遇美國放棄金本位，一切物價均見上漲，而美國又為銷納我國桐油的最大主顧，所以內地油坊都加工趕製，因之產量大增，外銷又暢；但至二十三年，究竟因世界一般經濟的轉入特種簫條的狀態，和美國提高銀價，我國商品輸出困難等緣故數字復趨低落。</p>
<p>但自今年來，桐油的對外貿易，似乎有着　蘇的景象，而在數字方面，顯着優異的成續。根據國際貿易導報的統計，本年度上去年桐油的輸出在每月土貨出口的總値中，最大（六月）曾佔到百分之十·九、最少（二月）亦佔到百分之四·二以上，而在一月至六月六個月中，四五六三月，部躍居對外輸出的首位，不雖達到如十九年一般的高低。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>桐油的對外貿易，在近來比較上雖又有着繁榮的發展，而前途似乎有無限的希望，但我們當考察它的經營方法是否合理？交易方面是否有一貫的聯絡？桐油提取的方法是否科學化？國內運輸是否有相當的設備？我們就可發見桐油貿易的組織，完全是建築在不健全的基礎上的，而內部包含着極大的矛盾。對於這，我們可以從兩方面來考察：</p>
<p>（一）榨取和提煉——關於榨取，無用說得，我國榨取桐油的方法，正和其他一切一樣，是墨守成法的。他們榨取桐油的手續大概是這樣的；先將桐子從桐樹上採下，剝去外殼，用淸水洗凈，放在陽光中曬乾，乾燥後，磨成細末，然後裝在木製的蒸籠裏蒸發；這樣大約蒸了半個鐘頭，取出盛於箍中，用麻布包好，製成餅形，再放在壓榨器中榨取油汁。在高壓力下，就會有流質從壓榨器中流出，這流出的便是桐油了。可是這種老法榨出的桐油，旣須經過一批批的手續，又要通過許多不淸潔的器具；一般奸商的故意攙加雜油，减低成色，現在姑置不論，就是一般正當商人要竭力要保持它的純潔，提高它的品質，在這種塲合下，無疑的是極困難的事情。這樣，個別經營不能擴充至大規模集體經營的老法榨油，往往使榨出的油質和成色不能劃一和分級，而合於標準。所以對於國際貿易上的信譽，每易發生不良的影響。為了這緣故，行銷外洋的桐油，榨取後，大都尙須再加以提煉的手讀，以提高品質。但是說到桐油的提煉，眞是個桐油貿易史上的絕大污點，事實是如此；我國桐油對外貿易開始到現在，自已竟連一個煉油廠都沒有，這樣便不得不仰給外人了，因為外商的煉油廠在中國是並不缺乏的。外人在我國經營的煉油廠，大都是集中在漢口的；在這許多的廠中，最大的當推美商其來洋行，其來洋行的油池，一次能容桐油三千五百噸，其次美孚煉油廠的油池，也有一千五百噸的容量，其他如日商三井，三菱，英商安利，怡和等洋行，都有煉油廠的設備，容量雖較小，但平均亦各可煉油千餘噸。在不多時的以前，怡和洋行在宜昌設了一個小規模的煉油池，容量約為一百噸，這樣，當地的油商都感到極大的便利。因為桐油一經入池提煉，油中的水分都被用蒸氣法抽去，渣汁也被沉澱，不但油質淸潔，透明，並且顏色也顯純黃，桐油的品質確可提高不少，但可惜各煉油廠的設立，都是外商的資本。</p>
<p>（二）運輸說到運輸，輸出國外的桐油，其國外運輸固然是力所未逮，不必置論；就是國內運輸，亦須仰外人的鼻息，這不得不說是件痛心的事。我們知道，我國產桐的區域包括江蘇，安徽，浙江，江西，湖南，湖北，四川，雲南，貴州，福建，廣東，廣西等諸省，面積不下數萬方哩，這幾省桐油的起運，其中除廣東，廣西以香港為中心，浙江，安徽，江蘇。以上海為中心，其餘湖南，湖北，四川，陝西，貴州，雲南諸省的桐油，大都集中於萬縣和漢口二埠；而重慶，宜昌，長沙等地，無形中又都成了桐油的分集中地。因為桐油從內地村鎮中零星收集攏來，必須運到分集中地待輪裝運。例如川西之油都集中於重慶，然後轉運到萬縣或漢口，再分售給洋商或運往國外。普通由重慶運往漢口的運費，是每噸二十元，如由宜昌運漢，祇約需十元。但是我們所看到的這些運桐油的船隻，都是外商的輪船。華商輪船則絕無僅有。為什麼呢？因為桐油不比其他的乾貨，運輸的輪船必須有油艙的設備，但是求之我國長江掄船有這種設備的，竟無一艘，於是桐油商只得乞助於外商輪船了。不過在好幾年前，外商輸船本也沒有這種油艙的設備，所以桐油運輸必須在宜昌轉口，轉裝太古怡和二公司的桐油鐵駁，但外商咨本旣厚，目光又遠，眼見桐油是長江貨物運輸的主要貨物，需運的數量旣多，利益又大，故新造的輪船，都特設油艙，以期獨攬桐油的運輸事宜；於是形成了外商輪船操縱桐油的運輸的局勢。在這種情形下，外商輸船柱往任意抬　運費，使桐油的成本增加；桐油成本增加，，對外輸出往往會發生不良的影響。</p>
<p>從上面兩點看來，我們可知桐油除了種械外，它的經營，大部分都是委之於外人的。那麼，這種商品的躍居出口貿易上重要位子，是不是健全的發展呢？每年幾千萬的交易，這金錢是不是都落在國人的手中呢？這些無用說得，巳是明若指掌了！</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>從上節，我們已明白所謂占我國土貨出口上重要位子的桐油對外貿易，它的經營原是洋商操縱着一切的在這節中，我們對它的前途，要加以展望。</p>
<p>根據事實的報告，我們知道，我國桐油自從首先輸往美國後，美國始終是我國桐油貿易上最大的主顧。往年的姑不必說，就是以近幾年來的看，其地位日趨重要，是極顯明的事實。下列一表，即表示近六年來我國桐油輸往美國的在總數中所佔的百分比：</p>

<p>從上表，可知我國桐油運往美國的年均約佔總數百分之七十左右。美國旣佔了這樣巨大的比率，如果一旦不用我國的桐油，我國桐油驟然間失了個極大的主顧，雖尙有百分之三十的主顧存在，但將陷於澹淡不振，幾頻絕境，是無法避免的結果。何况在這時，這百分之三十的主顧能否保持，尙屬疑問。所以在桐油貿易上，美國與我有着極密切的關係。可是我們看看事實上，美國朝野對於採用我國桐油拘着怎樣的態度呢？固然，桐油在今日，巳成為工業上不可或缺的原料，而暫時不得不繼續向我國採購，可是在另一方面，美人為了杜塞每年鉅額的巵漏起見，差不多舉國在熱烈的提倡械桐，因為根據一般人的預算，每畝桐樹可產桐果二噸，如每噸售價以二〇——廿五元計，則畝可獲金四五十元，這收獲已較種植咖啡優厚，何况此外尙有油餅等收入，同時這桐果售與工廠後，工廠方面尙有厚利可圖，因為假定桐來的價格為每噸噸。十五元，而其含油量為百分一之二十，則經榨取後，桐油每磅價格，不過五六分，較之現在市價八——一〇分，已可多三四分的盈餘。但在實踐方面如果工廠的製造方法愈益精密，分配管理愈合科學，則所獲可更大。所以美國朝野一方面在積極的籌建大規模的工廠，一方面熱烈的提仳植桐。雖然其中大部分的省分尙無良好的成績，但佛羅列達一省，已由一九二四年的植桐二萬英畝，而擴充至四萬英畝，桐樹巳達四百萬株，這對於我國桐油貿易的前途，無疑地是個極大的威脅。</p>
<p>同時，我們看到占我國桐油榆出百分之前三上的其他各國，正和美國一樣，他們都在熱烈的提倡植桐，在英國方面：英國自從皇家學會之油矝顧問委員會與油漆工業家合作向中美兩國採購大批桐種後，即分交各屬地試種。據最近報告，澳洲·紐西蘭·印度·緬甸·錫蘭·馬來亞·南菲聯邦·蘇丹·西印度·洪都拉斯，及其他英屬地，俱已有相當的成績，而前途正未可限量。此外各方面都巳有良好的成續：如阿根廷已植桐樹五萬株，巴拉圭植三萬株，俄國亦已植九百英畝，現在計劃一九三七年植桐三萬六千英畝。其他意大利，中南美洲各國，都向美國購辦大批桐種試植。但是？我們知道，桐樹的生長而至榨油，其中需要不少的時期，所以在目前，世界各國要達到桐油的自給計劃，是不易辦到的事。所以我國的桐油對外貿易，一時决不會摒棄於國際市塲的。但是，在不久的將來，各國植桐事業有成效後，自行採子榨油，無須再向我國採講，是必定的事實。那時我國桐油的對外輸出勢必每况愈下，陷於悲慘的地步，全國數十萬直接間接依賴植桐生活的人民，勢必受到極嚴重的影響。因為我國自已桐油的自需量原是極有限的，而大多數的桐油，都是準備輸出國外的。</p>
<p>在來後，我得說一句：我國桐油的所以有特殊的發展，無非是在地理天時上占勝罷了！良以我國南半部的土壤和氣候，最適宜於種植桐榭，而尤以長江上游及桂江流域所種植的最為發達，但是這種天時地理的占勝，眼見將成為歷史上的陳跡，而漸趨失敗。不過我們自己决不可氣餒，我們要利用這天時地理的占勝，一方面精選佳種，淘汰劣種；一方面用科學方法榨煉油質，以輕成本，至於改良運輸，與金融界取得切實的聯絡，更是不可忽略的要務。總之，我國桐油的在世界市塲上能否永遠保持它光榮的地位，不為絲茶之續，全在國人的急起直追，銳意改進能作事前和的挽救。</p>
<h3 id="c171">世界煤油爭奪戰之內幕 <a href="#c171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— 耐公</p>
<p>六十餘年前，煤油祇充治療婦女癌症之用一。但到現在，不論在工業上，交通上，尤其是軍事上，煤油已成為不可缺少的主角。歐洲大戰時，法國的老虎紹理克來孟索Clemenceau曾經說過：「一滴煤油，和一滴血同樣的可貴。」無怪近來各國間有許多爭執，即以煤油問題為其重心。如日俄北庫　島煤油的開採，和阿比西尼亞油礦讓與的問題，即其最好的例證。</p>
<p>關於煤油的生產，功用，及開採的技術諸問題，國內頗有許多學者，作詳盡的介紹。現在本文所叙述的，乃各國對於煤油爭奪戰的內幕。一方面，可以知道各國對煤油爭奪之尖銳；同時可以知道他們對於任何事情，都有還大的計畫和步驟，不像中國這樣毫無遠慮。</p>
<p>（一）波斯煤抽礦之奪取</p>
<p>歐洲大戰前二十餘年，波斯國王挪受庭，對於歐美人民，從來不願意予以援助。他祗允許少數歐洲人，可以在波斯國內遊歷。當時有加拿大的工程師阿西氏William　Knot　I'Arcy即係其中之一人。阿西氏知道，從前波斯有許多敎堂的附近，往往有長年不滅的聖火；而且在裏海的對岸，俄國已經從事開採煤油；所以他斷定波斯必定有煤油礦，因此决意實地去探尋。</p>
<p>阿西曾遍歷波期各地，但是他所追求的對象，始終沒有發現。他損失了許多金錢，但是他對自己的信仰，對上帝的信仰，却絲毫沒有喪失。他在旅行時期，除携帶必要的器具，地圖，和書籍外。還帶着耶蘇聖像和聖經。到後來，損失的金錢，達一千萬法郎之巨；他這種精神和毅力，使英國的金融家異常興奮，因此對阿西作經濟上的援助。但是煤油礦始終未能發現，英國的金融家們，對阿西以白眼相待；因此阿西也心灰意冷了。</p>
<p>阿西不再繼續探尋油礦，於是扶助波斯國王，發展各種事業。他建築了一條短程的鐵道，並且經營機械的貿易。在一九〇一年的時候，波斯國王賜給他一張「勅許狀。」在「勅許狀」中，國王准許阿西及其隨從與繼承者，對於波斯任何礦產，有七十年的自由探礦與開採權。不論礦產能否發現，祇就這張「勒許狀」的本身，巳有極大的價値。而同時正當頒賜此「勅許狀」時，阿西得着報告，在波斯的南部體思太Shustar地方，發現了煤油礦。阿西感覺得非常愉快，從前人家稱他為烏托邦的理想者，現在已可以證明自己信仰的正確了。</p>
<p>但是阿西已經沒有那樣意願和勇氣，去經營油礦了。他想回到裏國，度其風燭殘年。有人出價一百萬金鎊，購買他的一勅許狀，」他始終不願意；後來曾增加到六百萬金鎊，阿西也不為搖動。他回想自已的一生，倫教令融家對他的冷淡，和波斯國王對他的寵恩，晚對不願意波斯成為他人角逐的塲所。他自己的年事巳高，一生不再有所希冀，祇想休息，以優遊卒歲。在這時候，阿西的左近，佈滿了商人和偵探，想獲取道張「勅許狀」。於是他秘密乘船赴美國，再想回到加拿大。</p>
<p>阿西在船上，絕對不與任何人交談，他祈禱上帝，讀着聖經。船經菲洲時，有一位敎士，亦乘此船赴美。後來阿西與這敎士，漸漸熟識，並且告訴他自己對於波斯的留戀，和願意為波斯祈禱的心願。迨船離紐約還有兩天的行程時，阿西將自己一生的事蹟，波斯國十對他的思寵，和「勅許狀」的頒賜，全部告訴這位敎士。這位敎士，聽了阿西的話，一語不發，似乎不十分感覺興趣的樣兒。後來特然對阿西說：「你何不將這勅許狀」送給敎會，一方面可以免除紛爭，一方面敎會得到「勅許狀」，可以在波斯傳敎」。阿西當時並沒有回答，但是在輪船到紐約港之前，他却將這張「勅許狀」送給這位敎士，轉贈給敎會。這位敎士，名叫利雷，Sidney　Reilly他並不是一傳敎的敎士，而是英國海軍部派出的間牒。從利雷這張「勅許狀」，乃歸諸英國的海軍部。六百萬金鎊所不能購得的「勒許狀」，竟為英國海軍部一個間牒，不費分文，而獲得了。在一九一四年，英波煤油公司，（Anglo　Persian　Oil　Cｏ．）有百分之五十六的股票，操諸英國海軍部之手，這種秘密，最初還隱藏着，到大戰發生的時候，方始揭破。</p>
<p>（二）英美煤油之爭奪</p>
<p>英國旣經得着波期的油礦，因此引起了俄國的嫉忌。結果波斯將全國的煤油礦，劃為兩區；北方讓給俄國，南方讓給英國。在英國方面，頗覺不滿，乃利用間牒，及種種非常方法，後來波斯全部的油礦，仍舊完全歸諸英國。主持此項活動的，並不是英國人，乃是荷蘭人。他對英國的貢獻，比一般英國人更大，他是一個維護英國利益的柱石。此即現任荷蘭皇家公司Royal　Dutch的總經理地脫庭氏HenryDeterding。</p>
<p>地盼庭本來是荷屬南洋羣島一個小煤油公司的經理。他在南洋羣島，認識了當時荷蘭皇家公司的總經理凱斯萊Ressler。凱氏對他非常賞識，他公開的對人說，「地脫庭一人，即値十億金鎊」，因此聘請他到荷蘭皇家公司來工作。在這時候，公司裏財政非常因難。凱斯萊和地脫庭二氏，便設法增加資金，但結果祇募得五十萬荷幣Florins。在這種風雨飄搖的時候，荷蘭皇家公司，却得着許多很大的煤油礦。公司的業務，復蒸蒸日上。因此引起美孚煤油公司Standard　Oil　Company洛凱弗羅Rockefeller的嫉忌，而開始向這個英國荷蘭的集團攻擊。依荷蘭皇家公司許多股東，都贊成將公可售給美國人。但是地脫庭一人，堅决表示反到。當時荷蘭皇家公司總經　凱斯萊正逢病危，他力保地盼庭以自代。股東們依了凱斯萊的意旨，便請地脫庭擔任總經理。</p>
<p>地脱庭以五百　荷幣Floinr的資本，便和　資數億的洛凱弗羅宣戰。幸而他和沙梅爾Marcus　Samuel氏聯盟，在戰爭中，纔能獲得勝利。沙梅爾最初祇是一個輪船公司的下級職員，後夾自己積蓄了些資本，購買隻舊船，因為營業發達，而增加到十二隻新式輪船。他將遠東的貨物，運往歐洲，但從歐洲運回的貨物却很少。有人向他建議，在船隻由歐洲航回遠東時，可以順便將波斯的煤油，運到印度。他頓然覺得運輸煤油，是一個極重要的事業。於是他　劃了許多資本，建造煤油船。他不獨從事運輸煤油，同時還開採煤油。在他沒有和地脫庭携手的時候，他們實處於相互競爭的地位。</p>
<p>地脫庭有豐富的煤油礦，沙梅爾有多量的運煤油船隻。他們决意聯合戰綫，一個專事生產，一個專事運輸。在一九〇二年，組織一個亞細亞煤油公司Asiatic　Peiroleum　Company，專門從事煤油的貿易。</p>
<p>洛凱弗羅第一步戰略，即封鎖煤油船。他情願空船停航，却不運載荷蘭皇家公司的煤油。美孚公司在本國，有二十萬基羅米突的輸油管，而輸油管的運費，祗逮火車運費的十六分之一。所以美國許多小煤油公司都不能和美孚競爭。洛凱弗羅也想以同樣的手段，對付荷蘭皇家公司，但他已有沙梅爾的油船，替他担任運輸，因此洛凱弗維第一個計劃，便宣告失敗。</p>
<p>運輸封鎖政策，旣告失敗，於是開始價格戰爭。這次的戰塲，便在中國。中國有四億人民，洛凱弗羅認為是他的絕好市塲。他將煤油的價格，降到成本以下，在中國市塲出售。他分送八百萬盞燈，給中國人民。但是中國人受了洛凱弗羅的燈，却用地脫庭的煤油。</p>
<p>地脫庭的政策，也和洛凱弗羅一樣。他將煤油的價格，降到極低，在中國市塲銷售。但是因為運輸較近，所以損害較少。美孚公司在中國的損失，是以抬高歐洲及美國市塲的售價，以資抵補，歐洲市塲的售價抬高，在荷蘭皇家公司方面，也同樣獲着利益。但是洛凱弗羅抬高美國市塲的煤油價格，使美國人民，發生極大的反感。因此地脫庭便利用這種機會，和洛凱弗羅的仇敵，在美弗羅立達地方，設立煤油公司，而英國的煤油勢力，竟深入美國的腹地。現在加利福尼亞的油礦，亦歸其所有。不獨美國本國有一部份煤油礦，為其所有；即中部美洲，和南美洲大部份煤油礦，也都操諸地脫庭之手。</p>
<p>一般地質學家，都認為南美洲委內瑞辣Venezuela的煤油礦，為世界最費富之地。在這裏，美英權利的爭奪，也很尖銳。十餘年前，英國方面，鼓動他們革命，哥梅（Gomey）因此獲得政權，做委內瑞辣的總統，而經濟上，則完全由地脫庭的供給。委內瑞辣的油礦，整個的入於地脫庭之手。所有開採的毛油，也完全運到庫拉薩俄提煉，再運輸出口。</p>
<p>庫拉薩俄Curacao，是委內瑞辣沿海的一個小島，為荷蘭的屬地。在這島上，設立着煉油的塲所，和航行的港口。委內瑞辣的煤油，若是沒有庫拉薩俄，便失其功用。島上的居民，說着英葡西荷四種混合的言語。他們當常鬧着獨立，因為美國人對他們說，倘若獨立以後，康狩薩俄的稅收，便能歸他們自已使用，不必送給荷蘭。庫拉薩俄已成爲英車煤油的重鎭，華盛頓和美孕公司方面，時時想鼓動島上的人民反抗，維護他們的獨立。這不是為什麼眞義，是為了煤油。</p>
<p>哥梅Gomey是現在委內瑞辣的總統，統治了十五年的總統，是一個專橫的獨裁者。在委內瑞辣，有許多人喊着哥梅萬歲，因為哥梅養活他們，使他們得着奢侈和遊閒的生活。委內瑞辣也時常發生革命，做革命者經濟後盾的，便是美孚公司。</p>
<p>歐戰，煤油的需要，格外增加。美孚公司因大西洋有潛艇攻擊，所以將煤油轉移到遠東市塲推銷，尤其是中國。到一九一七年的十二月，法國煤油貯藏量，祗有二萬八千噸，僅能供聯軍二日之用。在緊急中，美孚公司的煤油運到了，使聯軍方面，得免去煤油的飢饉。魯盾獨夫將軍Luddo　　也說，協約國的勝利，是得力於煤油。</p>
<p>（三）蘇俄煤油戰略之新陣容</p>
<p>自從英國獲得波斯煤油開採權後，俄英在波斯的暗爭，無時或息。歐戰前，波斯國王曾將北部的油礦，讓紹俄國，但英國用種種方法，遂達其破壞的夙願。</p>
<p>蘇俄本國，原來有極豐富的油礦。歐戰前，他的煤油生產量，幾乎與美國相等。革命後初年，生產量大减。一九二二年，為八百萬噸；但到一九三三年，即增至三千八百萬噸。蘇俄的煤油戰略，乃聯合美國，傾覆英國的勢力。主持這神事情的人，即蘇俄著名的特務工作人員，愛茵霍恩Einhorn。</p>
<p>愛茵霍恩和現在波斯國王利柴鋼Rhiga　Khan二氏，是推翻英國在波斯的勢力的兩個主角。他們將波斯從英國保護國的地位，藉俄國的力量，獲得獨立·一九二八年，波斯宣佈各國在波斯的特權，完全取消。一九三二年，波斯廢止煤油專利。到一九三三年，波斯和英波煤油公司，訂立新合同，以代替）、　工年阿西所得的「勅許狀」。在新合　中　　斯並不將全部的油礦，均租讓興英國，公司方面每年須以贏利的百分之二十，　　　政府。且每開採一噸煤油，須納九便　　。而且除煤油外，其他不在租讓之列。從此以後，阿西的「勅許狀」，巳成廢紙。英國在波斯的煤油根據地及一切勢力，也完全喪失。</p>
<p>一九二七年，地脫庭想封鎖蘇俄煤油的國外市塲，引起蘇俄的極度恐慌。於　美孚公司便購買大批俄油，跌價推銷到英國的煤油市塲，因此地脫庭反受着極大損失。這次爭國，至胡佛　選總統方止。到現在，美孚公司與蘇俄方面，仍舊合作而美孚公司的特務人員，也和蘇俄煤油方面的特務人員，密切地連絡着。</p>
<p>（四）哈定與利維拉之迷</p>
<p>一九二〇年，哈定Harding得着洛凱弗羅的經濟後盾，　選為美國總統。他幾乎是美孚煤油公司的盲目工具，凡有所要求，無不承允。後來覺得這種愧儡，頗不正當，而公司方面的要求亦過甚，因此哈定漸漸變更態度。一九二三年初夏，他公然反對美孚公司。同年夏天，他離華盛頓避暑，後來從萬古華Vancouver傳出消息，哈定總統忽然暴死。有人說是中了蟲毒，有人說是為女人所謀害，有人更有其他猜測，但是似乎忘記他是很可能為煤油而犧牲的一個人。</p>
<p>在一九二七年，西班牙的獨裁者利維拉氏Primo　de　Rivera。他驅逐共產黨，復興西班牙。他覺得煤油的輸入，損害西班牙的利益至鉅，因此創立煤油專賣制，使一部分利益歸諸政府。這種制度，當然與地脫庭，洛凱弗羅利益相遠背。於是他們二人乃連合起來，不售油給西班牙。西班牙不得不向他的仇敵蘇俄以最高的價格，賻買最低劣的煤油。同時英國方面，引起了不購西班牙農產品的運動，在美國方面，也提高西班牙貨物的進口稅。西班牙國內乃呈紊亂現象，利維拉的政府因此傾覆，他逃亡到巴黎，但不久也是暴病死了。</p>
<p>（五）結語</p>
<p>上文所述的，祗是世界煤油爭奪中的幾幕。各國對於煤油，幾乎無日無時，不在處心積慮之中。在法國，現在規定煤油須與火酒混用。在德國，則從煤炭中提煉煤油。現在煤油的生產，仍以美國居首位，但據美國內政部地質調查股之報告。美國煤油的消費量，較世界其他各國的消費總量，約加二倍。但至一九四〇年，美國煤油蘊藏量即開採絕跡，而其他各國的煤油，則尙能供世界二百年之用。但世界各國的煤油礦，則太半操諸英國之手。換言之，即五年後，美國將向英國購其鉅量消費的煤油·美國把握着煤油的現在，英國持有煤油的將來。</p>

<p>— （俞慕古）</p>
<p>世間一切糾紛問題，要是憑着眞公理，就有眞是非，無論怎樣繁劇的爭端，都可迎刃而解，獨奈何一般强有力者，自已並不顧及公理，却偏要人家遵從他莫明其妙講不通的蠻橫公理，因此眞是非泯滅，擾攘愈甚。</p>
<p>猛獸為着飢餓相搏，推其極不過兩敗俱傷，而吾人譏它殘酷，可是人類的殘酷行為，正千萬倍於猛獸相搏，試看世人平時雖把人道主義標榜着，維持假面具的和平善性，但借着了維持和平與自衛的美名，絕對矛眉的偷偷摸摸盤算殺人的計劃，趕製殺人的利器，迨至一朝野性爆發的時候，惡鬥慘殺的殘酷行為，無所不用其極。</p>
<p>當事人，關係人，兩造律師，法官，當審訊辯論的時候，各人喜怒哀樂的恣態，較之風雲變幻，尤其神速，要是用快鏡把各人在一度訊審時期內的恣態，繼續不斷地一一攝下來，那種千奇百怪的狀貌，一定大有可觀，可以引起哲學家和心理學家無窮研討的興趣。</p>
<h3 id="c178">租借地 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— 楊餘聲</p>
<p>從前聽到一句笑話。說是一個瞎了眼睛的人，可以憑着他脚底神筋的感覺，去判斷「中國地界」和「外國地界」的，因為前者大都是碎石路，高低不平，而後者是，舖着柏油馬路的緣故</p>
<p>所謂「外國地界」的幾處地方，就是租借地的總稱，上海人口中的「大英地界」「法蘭西地界」這一類名詞，他們似乎忘掉那幾處土地的主權！應得嚴格糾正的</p>
<p>在歐美大小各國之間，似乎找不出「租借地」這個名詞，可是它和咱們中國却特別有緣，一訂就是九十九年，甚至沒有年限的租借下去，眞有「百年偕老」的氣概！</p>
<p>日本的橫濱，在一八五九年時也曾一度被闢為商埠設立過租借地的，但明治維新後就立卽收回。他們取銷租借地的方法，全憑人民自然的動向，凡是毘連租借地四週的地方，馬路特別寬大，房屋特別繫齊，交通特別便利，公共設備如電燈，自來水，公園，博物院，圖書館以及敎育機關如幼稚院學校等，沒有一處不特別考究！不力求完美！使得人民沒有意興往租借地跑！這種「努力建設」「和平奮鬥」的遺跡，據說現在還很明顯的可以看到！他們就是憑着這種自强不息的精神，纔能解脫一切覊勒而日</p>
<p>這正是咱們中國一個絕好的借鏡，時至今日如果人人仍在想到租借地去發洋財，圖安逸，貪淫樂，沒有一些振作的精神，圖强的觀念，那末，不要說現在的租借地沒有退租的時期！就是全國十地也必有統盤「出租」的一天！</p>

<p>— 孫麟昌</p>
<p>妬是人類的特性，而於婦女為尤甚，所以我國北方有一地名叫做一妬婦津」，聽說古時有倉庚者，能療此疾。現在據法國醫學博士法雷氏研究的結果，這種妒嫉，是起因於人體裏面的一種內分泌，內分泌在人體最為神奇，如果一個人的內分泌，不曾充分發育，則那人的身軀，亦必短小無疑，因為內分泌，是人類生理刺激的主要物，不可偏廢，靑春時期的內分泌發達特甚，所以妬性亦最熱烈。近世一般靑年男女，因三角戀愛任醋海裏興波，不可收拾；據雷氏說：「都是因妬忌而起的。」現在雷氏根據上述原理，發明了一種萎縮內分泌的特效藥，一經注射，那內分泌的興奮程度，便會衰落，而妒嫉之心也就此消滅了。聽說法國有許多靑年的伉儷們，當初因為彼此猜疑着，各有外遇，勢將離異，自從經雷氏治療之後，夫妻間的感情，都能和諧如初云。</p>

<p>— 陳小蝶</p>
<p>黃山建設委員會委員陳小蝶，近與申報記者周瘦鵑氏同游黃山，遍歷奇勝，逸情雲上。周氏向不作詩，此次隨處紀勝，竟成五十二首之多。同行涂筱巢君及乃郎鼎元。攝影至八百頁，可謂豪矣！陳君於黃山名勝建設，多所建議，草有黃山供臆一篇，已送請黃山建設會許世英先生斟酌施行。陳君詩書畫稱三絕，此行取得黃山畫稿甚多，聞將於二個月內完成五十幅，開會展覽，凡售出畫資，全數撥充水災賑捐及助黃山建設之費云。茲錄其黃山供臆原文如左：黃山客識</p>
<p>黃山　險，松風雲尤稱三絕，愈險愈奇，愈奇愈險，天都頂高八千尺，西海門厓裂千仞，不見其底，自古探險家無敢嘗試，山儈遂多神話。今天都巳由吳稚老鑿道。然絕頂處仍無磴級，僅於石壁鑿穴以容足趾，猱攀而上，頗類壁虎。或謂游山必以冒險，不險不奇，僕以為此好勝者之言耳。韓退之驅鱷魚，說朱泚，尙且不懼，而登華山，至於慟哭，梯取乃下。豈一梯之高，遂裹足哉；誠以身體毛髮，受之父母，天生吾人，尙有可用者在，遊山攬勝，涉險已可，拚命胡為？予嘗冒大霧，夜登文殊院，張文白君以為險絕，許靜老遺人四出覓予，當時以為豪，事後思之，頗覺鹵莽。故予詩云：涉勝險已可，拚命胡為乎？其詩甚長。靜老云：讀君詩，可謂盲人騎瞎馬，夜半臨深池，令人有餘悸。故予重入黃山，殊不敢再然拚命之游，如天都絕頂處，誠宜加以鐵練，使力弱者，得盡攀援，以窮其勝。</p>
<p>遊山遺興，必工三事，詩，畫，攝影是也。然黃山闊大，攝影家僅能取其一角，一遇雲霧，尤靴着手。若天都頂上之松，石筍缸頂之石，千變萬化，隨類賦形，竟使攝影家望洋興歎，位置無從。當是之時，惟畫與詩，尙能取其萬一，然奚囊所携，往往楮筆不備，借之儈院，亦惟敗楮殘蘆，無當寄興，而好境當前，一瞬即逝，使人回想，惋惜累日。是宜屬解事儈，多備佳楮筆，使游者有揮洒之樂，山寺得收藏之富，每每春秋，定期展覽，多聘鑒家定其棄取，則名山有必傳之作，藏棄無濫竽之恨。題名刻石，佳者固為名山生色，劣者實替山靈呼屈。黃山開闢未久，石刻較少，但好事之徒，未能免俗，遂使混淪元氣，漸見斵喪，管理局近雖有告戒之文，而寺僧不能以之禁止海客，徒成具文。僕以為游人刻石，不妨紙書，先送黃山建設委員會，由令指定專家，專事評選，佳者上石，劣者棄之，所有石工，必須由會代雇，定為專條，而後湼殘可免，字字有光。至若山寺題名之冊，則宜定用宣紙，製作尺寸，各寺皆取一律，或由管理局領回，加一整理，取其佳者，裝池成册，仍由寺儈寳藏，山齋客至，亦多展覽之樂。</p>
<p>近來游黃山者，多取道湯口，上文殊，宿師林，再宿松谷，出苦竹溪，以竟勝游，而足力較弱者，多至文殊院，畏難而止。度其理由，自居士林至文殊院，雖僅八公里，（約十八華里）然仰面登山，籃輿不易，若鐵闌干，小心坡，仄窒只能步行，初入山者，每怯攀涉，勇者陟級，亦不勝喘息。殆至文殊，左望天都，右觀蓮花，皆峻級千步，如人張兩臂於雲際，己所立處僅為顱也，則未有不失色畏葸至於退怯者。目自居士林至文殊院，八公里中，尙有半山寺可憩，而自文殊院下蓮花溝，登蓮花峰，下百步雲梯，出鰲魚洞，涉天海而至獅子林，上下數千級，中間略無坐休喘息之地，實為游山一大缺憾。故僕以為半山寺當可供宿，而天海至少須有一茅庵，以容喘息，可以稍復足力，以盡平天　東　門諸勝，否則未有不失之交臂者。</p>
<p>黃山奇松，隨處皆有，但經古人標目者，以天風浩蕩，百數年來，多半枯萎，補植固有所不能，續名似有所可取，或嫌取此名彼，不無假借，則不妨別選新名，號此古樹，使遊山者，多指點之樂。至舊有諧松，亦嘗有一松數名者，亂亦無傷大雅。</p>

<p>— 陳任</p>
<p>一·發行會誌初每年四次，後（一九二四年）改每年二次，至今已刊行五四期。將砂眼豫防之須知，預防成績，及會務情形公布於世。</p>
<p>二·講習會之開催，講習會分二類：種對一般醫師之講習，以灌輸砂眼預防方法，以及診斷學治療學及手術實習等。又一種為通俗砂眼之講習會，對一般民衆，如學校如接客業者等，灌輸以砂眼之常識，而知所預防。各講習會或由各地醫師會，或其他學會，或協會自己主辦，而講師則由協會派赴出席，以使預防事業之統一。</p>
<p>三·發刊「通俗砂眼須知」數萬餘冊，於演講會中分布羣眾。又編「砂眼診斷，治療，預防，講話資料」，為一般醫師之參考。</p>
<p>四·利用各種展覽會，陳列實物蠟製砂眼患者顏面模型，實物二倍太蠟製砂眼模型六種，並其他一切砂眼傳染預防之掛圖，以廣宣傳。</p>
<p>五·設立免費診療所，由協會之醫師主持，對各階級之人民，與以免費之檢查及治療。</p>
<p>六·砂眼幻燈映畫之製作。協會雖然經濟困難，然卒能排除萬難，而完成四卷三千八百餘尺關於砂眼之映畫。頗得社會之好評，及當局之推薦。</p>
<p>七·對政府之建議請願。協會為私人之集團，其力究屬有限。故促政府之注意，而對砂眼切實實施預防政策，為協會之重大使命。</p>
<p>（四）日本砂眼預防事業之成績日本砂眼預防事業之成績大概略述如下：一·羣衆之檢診，以獲砂眼分布之情况。其方法如次：</p>
<p>A一定區城內，全民之檢查。此事世界唯一，各國無不驚異。</p>
<p>B各種職業上民衆之檢診，如看護業者，理髮匠，旅館飮食店之職員等。</p>
<p>D學校之生徒，一切男女大中小學校。</p>
<p>E每年徵兵之檢診。日本實行通國皆兵，徵兵之制度。每年徵兵皆為二十歲左右之靑年，對砂眼檢診，極為注意。由帝大眼科敎授石原先生私人之報告，日本徵兵檢查之統計報告，為日本一切統計報告中，最為精確，最為可靠之統訃。因其檢診者，俱係眼科專家也。</p>
<p>二·治療上之施設及經費。公設治療所每年平均有四五二，〇〇〇砂眼患者之求治。此外尙有道府縣立之治療所，私設之診療所，及巡回治療班等。到處林立，患者人人有治療之機會，然後砂眼有撲滅之可能。</p>
<p>至於經費如下：</p>
<p>市町村公立之診療所，每年平均經費二六二，〇五九圓（平均每患者計〇·六〇圓。）</p>
<p>偏僻地之治療班　每年平均約六·一九二圓</p>
<p>道府縣立之診療所　每年平均四·七二六圓</p>
<p>私設診療所　每年平均一三·〇八八圓</p>
<p>共計二八六·〇六五圓</p>
<p>三·預防事業之成績。茲將量精確，量可靠之陸軍省徵兵檢查之砂眼統計，報告如下：</p>
<p>徵兵檢查時，壯丁之砂眼罹患率如次：</p>
<p>大正元年（一九一二）　廿四·〇％</p>
<p>四年（一九一五）　十八·〇％</p>
<p>七年（一九一八）　十五·三％</p>
<p>十年（一九二一）　十三·九％</p>
<p>十三年（一九二四）　十四·五％</p>
<p>昭和二年（一九二七）　十二·七％</p>
<p>五年（一九三〇）　十一·一％</p>
<p>八年（一九三三）　九·六％</p>
<p>可見日本靑年期之砂眼，年年减少。日本預防之事業之成績，由此可知一般。每年約半百萬金之耗費，實非虛擲也。</p>
<p>（五）·結諭</p>
<p>我述日本砂眼預防協會介紹事畢，心中不竟無限之感嘆，日本為吾同文同種之國，昔曾同遭列强之魚肉。而今不出百年，彼則國勢日興，而我則國勢日弱，日本之維新，舉國一致，向唯一之理想前進。此理想為何：「先進國之效法，近代國家之建設耳」。今日之日本，卽此理想之開始，國人其鑒諸。</p>

<p>學校兒童之防癆方針</p>
<p>兒童之防癆方針，其最重要者，乃為早期診斷，凡患有結核，及有結核嫌疑之兒童，俱應施以隔離，而送入療養院治療，但如何可以檢查兒童之患有結核症者，其事甚難，卽校醫亦莫能為力，理想中自以土白克林檢查法為最妥蕃，若此種方法，不克施行時，則凡有下列情狀之兒童，應令診療所加以特別之注意。</p>
<p>（一）凡兒童之家屬，歷史上有結核症之證明者，尤以其父母兄弟姊妹在兒童出世之時，有結核症之發生，或因之而死亡者。</p>
<p>（二）凡兒童直接之環境中，有結核症之發生者。</p>
<p>（三）十分虛弱，及身體發育惡劣之兒童。</p>
<p>（四）凡兒童之有淋巴腺病者。</p>
<p>（五）凡兒童之時染威　者，及因發炎症時時輟學者。</p>
<p>（六）凡見童食慾不良者。</p>
<p>（七）傳染病後之復原期，尤以麻疹百日咳急性感冒等。</p>
<p>（八）時時咳嗽而發熱者。</p>
<p>（九）凡兒童或敎員在校中發現開放性結核者。全班或全校之學生，俱應施以檢查。</p>
<p>一九三一年德國之結核死亡統計</p>
<p>普羅士之結核死亡統計，以一九三一年觀之，較之一九一三年至一九二八年之統計，幾减少三分之一而强，惟在二歲至五歲之幼見，自二十五歲至三十歲之成人，在死亡統計上，減少不多，而學校兒童及四十歲至七十歲之年齡間。統計上較為安全，惟在職業年齡內，其紹核之死亡例極高，結婚之婦女，在統計上之死亡例，並不增高，</p>
<p>美國結核死亡統計之減少</p>
<p>克氏之報告，北美合衆國之結核死亡統計，在一九〇四年為每十萬人中有二百零四人，在一九三一年僅六十七人，此種結核死亡統計之減少，在有色人種亦有同樣之傾向，其故乃由於確實之病理原因已經證明，而尤以外科的手術方法之進步，療養院設備之完全，及公共衛生之進步，在最近數年內，結核之死亡例，益形減低，如合衆國之十州，在一九三二年正月至六月間之統計，較之上年之同樣月份，已減少八％云。</p>
<p>法國因結核死亡者之每年損失</p>
<p>法國之死亡統計，每年為六十九萬例，其中有九萬例因結核而死亡，大概而論，男性約佔五萬，女性約佔四萬，在十歲以下之幼見死亡例，現已减少，但自十歲至二十歲之間，其兩性死亡統計亦漸漸增加，以後婦女則至四十歲止，男子至五十歲，又漸漸相並而下降，在法國大約有三十萬之工作年齡自十五至五十五歲間者，每年因結核而死亡，其影響及於國家之生產力者，為十一億法郎，而於治療上之耗費，死亡者家屬之補助金，均尙不計，故至少每年尙有十五億法郎之損失也。</p>
<p>挪威之結核症現狀</p>
<p>挪威居民之五二·％為土白克林反應陽性者，其中〇·九％為二歲以下之嬰孩，一〇·九九％屬於十八歲以下之見童，凡屬於開放性之結核患者，均稱為傳染原泉，（九七％）患者之住宅稱為傳染處域，（八四％）結核死亡例之三分之二，均由其自己家宅之傳染所致，大都均由於沫點傳染所造成。　在十三歲至三十歲之間，結核之臨床診候，最易發生，而四分之三肋膜炎患者，大都發生於傳染後之三年以內，細菌性之免疫法，對於過敏性反應，有一種相當之抵抗力，但在內生的蔓延性結核，則不見有效，而先天性之抵抗力，其關係非常重大，以經騐而論，結核症之傳染，僅有隔離病原因之辦法，最為可用。</p>
<p>火酒與結核</p>
<p>在一千七百四十二例之兒童病歷上觀察之，發現百分之五十而强外科結核之兒童，其家屬均為飮酒者，自一九一六年起，荷蘭舉行禁酒條例後，其結核之死亡例，尤以男性之老人結核患者之死亡例，减低不少。</p>
<p>意大利之防癆組織</p>
<p>最近意大利摩萊尼氏曾在國家科學會議中發表意大利對於防癆之組織及成績，按摩氏為卡羅福拉尼新式療養院院長，意大利全國醫師公會秘書長，國家防癆恊會副會長，其地位極為重要，其言</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>曰，自意大利對於結核病施行强迫保險法以來，每年之結核死亡統計，已自五萬人减至四萬人，凡結核患者應雖開家庭，而在結核環境中之兒童，更屬重要，關於防癆方法之重要實施，為結核病之强近保險，凡在月俸入百力力而（一力而合華幣二角）以下之薪水陪級，俱須履行結核保險法，此外則法西斯主義之國家研究院，對於公衆衛生及治療方法之改進，亦不遺餘力，如最初對於結核患者，僅令注意其家庭之療養法，但現在因大規模之療養院及治療所之成立者不少，故對於不規則之家庭治療方法，已完全不復採取，摩氏之意見，療養院應建築在高山上，而病床數量尙須繼續加，此種結核死亡統計之减低當然並非完全由於直接防癆之工作，實亦由於公共衛生改善之所致，最後糜氏又謂凡醫師之擔任防癆工作者，必須經過專門之訓練，而此種之工作，乃屬於國家的工作，則於防癆之進行，必能增加其效能云。（寄自瑞士日內瓦）</p>

<p>凡是熟悉種痘的歷史的人，都知道愛德華·奇納（Edward　Jenner）這個名字。在醫學史上，奇納被推崇為種痘的始祖，一直享受着一般醫藥發明者的榮譽。其實，奇納的榮譽，是受之有愧的。奇納所介紹的，是用牛痘種在身上以防天花的法術，但在這以前，歐洲早已流行着用人身的天花膿種在身上的法術—卽所謂「種花」。最初把「種花」介紹到歐洲來的，是蒙泰古夫人（Lady　MaryWortley　Montagn），而牠的發源地則在土耳其。</p>
<p>蒙泰古夫人是當時英國駐士耳其大使的夫人。一七一七年四月一日，這位大使夫人在她寫給本國某夫人的信中說道：</p>
<p>「我要告訴你一伴事情，我相信這事情會使你願意住在這裏的。在我們那裏非常普遍而有性命之憂的天花，在這裏却因Ingrafting的發明而變成完全無害。在這裏，有一羣老婦人每年到了九月間就以施行這樣的手術做她們的專門職業，那時節劇烈的熱度已減退了。人們相率詢問：他們的家屬裏面有沒有願意出一回天花的。這些人集在一處（大概每組十五六人），老婦人就走過來，隨帶着一果殼的『頂好』天花膿，問你願意讓她割開那一枝脈管。你把這告訴她，她立卽把這部分的皮膚用一枚大針割開這會使你感到如被抓一把一般的痛，又把針頭上的天花膿放入你的脈管中。大概到了第八天，你開始發熱了。不到幾天，臉上就發出天花來—至多不過二三十粒。這裏的法國大使有一次說笑話：土耳其人『喫天花』正和別國人喝水一般」。</p>
<p>在這以後的半百年中，關於「種花」的實施有許多著名的代表人物。梅脫蘭博士（Dr．Maitland）是蒙泰古夫人的第一個英國門徒。凱羅林王妃（PrincessCaroline）說服喬治一世（Gelrge　I）赦免六名定罪的犯人，叫他們受「種花」的手術作為試騐。梅脫蘭博士就於一七二一年在這六名罪犯身上施行「種花」。結果他們都發出輕淡的天花而得免除絞刑。</p>
<p>在法國，國王路易十六世（LouisXVI是於一七七四年受「種花」手術的。王室的大膽的嘗試，當時被看做一種盛典。王后的服飾匠白丁夫人（Mile．Rose　Bertin），為紀念這盛典起見，特創製一種特別頭飾，形如一粒天花膿泡。</p>
<p>在十八世紀，最著名的施行「種花」者是亭斯台耳男爵（Baron　Dimsdale）他被俄國女王凱脫林二世（Catherine　Ⅱ）邀請赴俄施行種花」。當時俄國人民不但對於「種花」不敢嘗試，而且把亭斯台耳男爵看做惡魔一般，一見他到來，就相率奔避。國王特地派一隊禁衛軍陪作到一家人家去種痘苦惱的母親蜷伏在屋角裏，想把她的最小的三歲男孩藏過。為提倡起見，國王親自受試，她的愛人奧洛夫（Grogory　Orlov）和她的嗣子保羅公爵（Grand　Duke　Paul）亦都受試。此三人受術的結果，都很良好，於是在王室和民問種花的風氣漸盛，而聖彼得斯堡（St．Petersburg）的醫生們都開始學習這一門手術了。</p>
<h3 id="c188">談自身發泡戒烟法 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 宋國賓</p>
<p>緣起　余於本法之試用，遠在第八次遠東熱帶醫學會發表以前，當六年前余偶閱法文某雜誌，見有用發泡戒酒之諭文，心焉奇之，遂試用之於戒烟，頗著奇效，後乃以此法授震旦醫科同學，而令其實習於醫院之中，及諸同學相繼畢業，散布四方，此法展轉相傳遂漸為國人所知曉，最近上海各戒毒所及隴海路全綫均以此法為戒烟不二法門，其所戒烟民達千萬人之衆，而余與楊延年醫師所主辦之體仁醫院，數年以來用此法戒絕者亦不下數千人，成績皆甚可觀，比於遞减法，誠取效速而痛苦少矣！此法初用阿摩尼亞樟腦油合劑發泡，戒者每感痛楚，自改用國產斑螫軟膏以來，遂毫無痛苦之可言矣，茲以各方函詢者紛至沓來，用特拉雜書之以當答復：</p>
<p>原理　鴉片為毒物之一，無癮者吸之，稍過量則中毒，有癮者吸之，雖大量亦無妨，此何故歟？蓋人體不能容納異物，對於毒物之侵入，每發生一種抗毒之素以消滅之，鴉片之吸入也亦然，有癮者體內發生「抗鴉片素」對於吸入之鴉片有中和之作用，與需要之現象，故吸入之烟，則經其消滅，過時不吸，則感覺需要，此有癮者所以鮮中毒之發生也。根本戒烟之法，厥為肅淸此種「抗鴉片素」使身體恢復其未成癮時狀態，不能感受鴉片之吸入，而同時身體自無鴉片之需要。發泡戒烟之原理卽某於此。蓋泡漿內有該素之存在，但一經抽出，與外界接觸，遂起理化的變化，而成為一種特殊的異性蛋白質，設再以此注射於受戒者之自身，其體內血液，為之擾亂，而失其平衡常態，其存在體內之「抗鴉片素」，亦遂於此混亂狀態之下而沈澱而消失其作用，此所謂「蓄尅」Choc現象是也。職是之故，受戒者經注射若干時後，不但無需要鴉片之現象，且若一經試吸，卽起惡心嘔吐種種不快之過敏現象。此卽發泡戒烟之原理通俗的解釋也。</p>
<p>使用之注意　發泡手術，醫家共曉，無須贅述，但有一點須經注意者，卽收效之遲速與泡漿之分量有關，如一次發出之漿，在十cc以上，則收效甚速，否則仍須繼續施行，泡漿之多寡，視乎皮膚之粗細，皮膚粗者，發泡較難，泡漿較少，皮膚嫩者，發泡甚易，惟勿損壞，故敷泡之時間，長短不同，因人而異，醫家於數次經騐之後，當自知之。</p>
<p>本法使用之前，受戒者不妨飽吸鴉片，注射後亦不妨吸用，逮至過敏現象發生，則鴉片之需要亦去。</p>
<p>發泡後，受戒者宜靜臥勿動，以免所發之泡因行動而破壞。</p>
<p>效用　發泡法之效用，不僅在戒絕鴉片，而於紅丸，白面，嗎啡高加因等癖，皆可以籍以戒除，據楊延年醫師之報告，其效騐較之戒鴉懲為尤速尤靈焉。</p>
<p>經本法戒絕之烟民，不但鴉片之需要消失，卽對於其宿所嗜好之紙烟酒類，亦同時發生一種厭惡的反感。</p>
<p>但此種厭惡的反感是一時的，換言之，卽「過敏現象」經過若干時日而卽消滅，故又有復吸之可能，余曾親見數人，意志薄弱，當其求戒也，為環境所偪而來，及至戒絕之後，則又見時間經濟兩俱節省，精神身體痛苦毫無而存復吸之念，及至環境改變，則果重入黑籍，於是戒而復吸，吸而復戒，循環不已，反復如常，說者謂本法過於無痛安全轉易啟戒者輕於嘗試之念，其然乎豈其然乎？於以知天下有至良之法，亦有至不良之人，是所望於禁烟法令之嚴厲執行而已</p>
<p>發泡戒烟，成效卓著，惟據楊延年醫師報告，烟犯中以吞食生烟者收效較難，蓋鴉片包含各種毒質，吞食成癖，其中毒程度自較吸用者為更深，又林文忠膏，卽生烟之變相，久服者亦難戒絕云。</p>
<p>結諭　大凡一方法之發明，其始也，社會之批評不一，有信仰者，有反對者，有故意誣衊者，發泡戒烟，亦猶是也，前見申報康樂特刊，王鈍根先生「無痛苦戒烟」一文，於發泡戒烟詆之不遺餘力，此實有淆亂社會聽聞，恐怖烟民心理之處，鈍根之意本在推銷某工業社之蛋黃素，余於蛋黃素之是否有效，不願論及，而對於王君所言失實之處，則不能加以糾正焉！發泡戒烟，比之其他戒烟方法為最尠痛苦，除最短時間之失眠腿痠外，甚尠其他症狀，夫黑海等於地獄，脫離黑海，不啻由地獄而升天堂，若並此些微之痠楚而不能忍受，尙何决心戒除之可言哉？</p>

<p>（七十）口腔炎（續）</p>
<p>（第六）化膿性口腔炎</p>
<p>化膿性口腔炎多發於舌及口腔底的兩部。所以在臨床上可以分為實質性舌炎及羅道維氏（Ｌudovici）咽炎的兩種。現在分別大略講一講。</p>
<p>（甲）實質性舌炎日本病常因昆虫的刺傷，或他種細微損傷而發。但是亦有毫無原因而發病的。牠的主要症候。就是病人的舌頭。特別腫大。以致口內難於容藏。常常伸露齒外。或者壓迫咽喉。引起呼吸困難。病人在談話，咀嚼及嚥下作用等等時候。亦多感不便。有時且來全身症候。</p>
<p>（乙）羅道維氏咽炎　本病實為口腔底的急性蜂窩織炎。概因釀膿球菌而發。炎症的發源處。常在下顆腺。本病有原發性及續發性的兩種。不過在臨床上所見的。多為續發於白喉，猩紅熱，傷寒及流行性感冒等等。牠的主要症候。卽於下顎枝及舌骨間的皮膚。發生潮紅，腫脹及疼痛。口腔底旋卽高舉。舌頭緊迫口蓋。所以在談話，咀嚼，及嚥下作用的時候。均可發生困難。或者竟可完全不能。如若病勢劇烈，則能壓迫喉，頸靜脈及食管。而起種種危險症狀。</p>
<p>本病大半發生膿瘍。而向外方或口腔破潰。很少中止病機。吸收而愈。所以牠的預後。概歸不良。死亡數約為百分之五十。至於牠的治療方針。首宜施用消炎法。若已形成膿瘍。則須從速排膿。是為要道。（口腔炎完）</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>末後，作者還有一事要聲明的，就是：所謂堅强之意志，係單獨對息者之苦思多慮而對症發藥的：間接的目的，是希望患者肉體精神同時安靜，有助於其他之治療的。並不是說人定可以勝天，一切的症勢變化均可視若無覩；空氣營養以及其他種種的治療均係贅疣的。這一種流弊所極，比較前者可史大了；希望本症　患者們認識淸楚纔好。</p>
<p>第四節　光綫治療</p>
<p>這是一種比較普遍的治療方法；就中有口皆道無人不知的，當然是天然的日光了—他是人人必需的，他的放射，有益於人體也非　鮮的；日光浴一名詞，近來更被一般人所樂道的。對於肺結核症，主張參用日光治療者，也是狠多的。他們以謂患者在日光下曝晒，藉紫光綫放射的力量，狠容易發生皮膚染色，結果對於本症的一般症象，都有優良之影響的。但另一部分醫家是狠　疑的。因為在日光下曝晒過久，狠容易引起出血和胸膜炎，並且有好多本症，病灶變化已在停止，反因之而重燃的。如果未脫衣服而在日光下曝晒，　容易引起鬰血狀態。所以日光治療一層，醫家應該狠愼重從的；對於患者之究竟適應與否，以及曝晒時間之確定，尤未得重要。</p>
<p>在何種結核狀態下，最適應於日光的治療呢？尋常帶結核性之膿瘍，骨結核等，所謂外科結核是；大半是適宜的。在肺結核一方面，像滲出性，早期浸潤，空洞，以及有咳血及胸膜炎之傾向者：都應該禁忌的。此外係增生性硬變性的型式，是可採取的。關於曝晒的稈序，最初在足部，由此而漸上昇至頭部，頭部是决對小宜的。時間最長　後面各三十分為度；如果過長了，是極易發生嘔吐以及種種神經狀態的。小孩有時易惹　氣管枝炎症，須注意。</p>

<p>近日本埠謠言甚多，所以搬家的人，十分起勁，尤其是閘北。試問其怎樣不好？則日消息不佳，時局不靖，又要打仗。又問其和什麼人打仗。天然不必說和某國人打仗，</p>
<p>果然要打仗麼？果有打仗的可能麼？此種常識的判斷力量，我國人一些沒有，而最喜歡去聽信謠言，眞是可憐已極，不信，請看市政府一再闢謠，並禁止居戶遷徙，學生曠課，希望市民以常識判斷謠言，以鎮靜觀察時局，又我國軍政部長何應欽氏，談中央對日政策不變，凡頭腦冷靜，常識豐富者，當不至爲造謠者所愚弄。現在報紙的信用，雖已破產，但市政府的皇皇吿示，軍政部長的切實談話，難道也是虛偽的麼？</p>
<p>但是有一般人，對於報紙上的說話，以爲不足信，市政府的文吿，也不足信，軍政部長的談話，也不足信，而獨喜歡聽信一派無稽之談，空頭之語，一若有憑有據，不能不信者，此何種心理耶，一家搬塲，諸家俱起，一人傳說，衆論僉同，甲家搬遷，乙必日甲家遷移矣，勢必大禍之將臨，我亦不能不遷移，乙家遷移矣，丙丁等家，又大驚曰，甲乙等家搬遷矣，必定消息不好，我等亦不能不遷移，但對於事實如何，不問也，結果庸人自擾，徒受一塲損失。</p>
<p>推究此種謠言的流行，當亦必有相當的原因，（一）近來市面不景氣，而一般無菜之徒，專喜有事，可以趁風打刦，（二）閘北自一二八之役，損失非常重大，現在是驚弓之鳥，（三）市民的缺乏常識，一開謠傳，便信眞實，一若禍之將至，我國人不重實際，專信浮言，於此可見，故聽神鬼之談，則思入海求仙，看武俠之書，卽欲入山訪道，我國人之絕無科學常識判斷能力，而妄自紛擾，大抵如此。</p>

<h3 id="c193">樹膠園 <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 從龍</p>
<p>記得見時一跨出小學校的門檻，總歡喜跑到父親的樹膠園里去，獨個兒坐在膠樹底下靜聆着南國溫柔的暖風嘯着輕微的哨聲，瞧着膠樹葉上金粉似的陽光一閃一閃地顚簸動蕩若。最使我的稚小的心靈感到高興的還是那管理膠園的老余，他不時送給我一些可口的食物，和園尾巴他自己種下來的香蕉。當他每次送東西給我的時候，臉孔老是笑迷迷的，裂開嘴巴，露出兩排黑牙齒，說：「四少，謂嘗嘗吧，——嘻嘻，小意思」—或是「這香然是新從園後割下來的，味道還不錯。」這一類的話。</p>
<p>同時，我又喜歡樹膠園里的乾凈，齊整，有秩序。在膠　底下，齊整得幾乎連一根雜草都不容許牠　生着，呈顯看一片平鋪的赤色。每天。老余總是忙於四處逡巡，汗流浹背地監督着工人拔去樹下的雜草。有時，我真替他不耐煩，問：「幹嗎要拔去樹下的小草呢，老余？」他迅速的轉過腦袋來，扮起笑臉很謙誠地回腔：「四少，雜草是會分去膠樹的肥料的，使膠樹不能很快長大，膠汁多起來的。——嘻嘻，所以榭下的雜草非拔去不行。」當刈取膠汁的時候，成羣的馬來人，手里持着巴　刀，在膠樹幹上很細心而又考究地刈着，他們的刈法，大都刈成「V」字形，或「Y」字形。</p>
<p>父新平毒辣對於膠樹的保護，彷佛像保護自己的生命一樣。每逢樹膠漲價的時候，為要趕市，大都不分日夜地採刈，可是，父親對於夜里工作，總有點不太放心，因為工人們工作的時候，要一手提着燈籠一手拿着巴瓏刀，有時因为他们的精神的過度疲勞，或光綫不足的緣故，對樹幹總免不了傷害，因此，非到萬不得已的時候，趕夜里工作父親是絕不輕易幹的。</p>
<p>有一個時期，父親吃過了晚飯就佩着雪皚皚的腰刀，英氣勃勃地到園里去。那時候，一聽到父親要上樹膠園去總使我感到興趣，我要求父親帶着我一道走，可是，母親却阻着我說：小孩子，跟去做什麼？爸爸是去緝捕那些偷拾樹膠種子的野種的。」因為那個時候，一顆種子幾値一角錢，老余一個人在夜里管不了那麼偌大廣闊的樹膠園，所以，父親每夜要親自上園里去帮着巡視的。</p>
<p>有時候，父親喝過幾盅燒酒之後，臉孔殷紅，像舞台上的關公似的，他已經醺醺然有醉意了。然而，在這個時候，他總歡喜開啟了鐵保險箱，拿出政府發給下來的樹膠山底「呀囒」，（契據）顛顚倒倒地端詳着，（自然父親是不大認得上面的番字的。）很得意地，彷彿小孩子般的抿着嘴嘻嘻的對母親　膿着：「蘭，二百「衣葛」（英畝）底樹膠山；你看，——現在每「衣葛」可値五百元以上的地價了。」</p>
<p>有一回，父親從樹膠園回來，把手里的一團樹膠絲，安放到鐵保險箱里去，這使母親有點兒覺得奇異，她說：</p>
<p>「怎麼連這些樹膠絲也當成寳貝般的藏到鐵保險箱里去呢？」</p>
<p>可是，父親却重大其事地回答：</p>
<p>「你不要小看這兩三斤東西，現在，牠可値十幾塊錢了。」臉孔現着得意的神氣。</p>
<p>那時可說是父親的黃金時代，同時，也是家里過着最快樂的日子，然而，誰能知道，那是最美滿，最快樂的時候的呵！</p>
<p>而今，父親的來信，總說南洋的膠業蕭條的可憐，就是每百斤的樹膠降低到十多塊錢也沒有人來過問。有時因為家里的急用，情願把樹膠山底「呀囒」每「衣葛」三五塊錢轉讓給人，也都沒有人要了。</p>
<p>我去年因為失了業，回到家里去。當我走到闊別多年的樹膠園去的時候，膠園里冷靜的一個人影都沒有，管理膠園的老余巳經不在了；據說他已在去年給父親辭退了。廣闊的膠園，沒有人管理，膠樹下的雜草高可沒脛蓬蓬勃勃地蔓生着，樹膠種子也沒有人再去偷拾，任牠撒播滿地，小膠樹毫無倫次地滋生起來。</p>
<p>回想起父親的樹膠園當年的盛况，距今不過十幾年的辰光，但，那盛况巳像流水般的消逝得沒有聲息了！</p>
<p>當我默想起當年的父親膠間揷着一把犀利的腰刀，英氣勃勃的在榭膠園里來回逡巡的時候，和目前的潦倒不堪的荒凉的情狀，心，不由得悽愴起來。</p>
<p>從此，我怕走上父親的樹膠園了！</p>
<h3 id="c194">駝鈴小唄 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>天光漸漸地短促起來，夏日的黃昏，現在是烏黑的夜了。天上的雲已經失去了那紛雜的色彩與多態的幻變；曠野裏的山谷中，楓葉也漸漸地褪去了炙人的鮮紅，而一天天地落到褐色的日子中去了。天是終日的灰暗而沉悶，在低低的灰空中，像是堆滿着雪與水似的，有點寒意的風恐嚇地吹來，帶着黃沙與枯枝的氣息，於是，早晚一陣雨，一陣寒意，秋天像一堆陳舊了的湆影一樣的無言地淌着過去，而接着潛來的，是很一般的沒有溫暖的冬天了。</p>
<p>是的，已經是冬天了呀。黃昏，獨個兒坐在昏暗裏，四週是靜寂的，像在另一個世界裏那樣的冷漠而茫然。從小小的窗子裏望出去，天是那麼狹小而灰黑的一塊，空洞，荒寂，於是，意象在這時候走入了一個遼遠的奇異的境界；我馳想着在蒙古的大沙漠中孤獨的旅行，風捲起迷眼的砂子，奔向無盡頭的前方去，落日在無邊的大地上撤下憂鬰的金黃色的光彩，這之間，一個人，一匹駱駝，緩緩地在這沙的海裏一寸。一寸地移動着步子，背着夕陽，在枯黃的沙地上設射了一片寄怪的影子；駱駝在晚風中不時怪嘯，頸項裏繫着的銅鈴，隨着沈重的脚步發出古舊而抑鬰的聲音，凄絕而哀怨，給捲在黃褐色的風裏，疏疏落落的，悠遠地飄傳開去，絕不會在一粒小砂石上停留……</p>
<p>一步一步地，那麼走去。希望是高遠的，而目前的路却是那樣地渺茫而艱苦！夜色不停地襲來，初冬的荒漠中，那種可怕的情境是難以設想的！脚步和着心跳，一切全顯得那麼單調啊！駝鈴一次一次地散到冷風中去，像失掉了串綫的珍珠，像幽冥的鐘。</p>
<p>夕陽也消失了，路依舊望不到盡頭；沙的海是那麼的寬大，而駱駝則依然擺起古老的，緩慢的步子，麻木而蠢儒地走着，於是，一聲聲的銅鈴，是會被設想作是不幸的呼救了。</p>
<p>這是一種什麼情境呢？連馳想都是可怕的啊。然而，沂年來，我終於三四次地會想到這精形的。不錯，世界太像日暮的沙漠了。而生活則是冬日的風！可是，那駱駝呢？那孤獨而疲乏的旅人呢？那散在北風中的駝鈴呢？</p>
<p>帶着沈重而緩滯的日子，居然也一個個的年頭生活過來了。一想起　，人是會怕得發抖的；可是過去了的便隨他去吧，而未來的呢？</p>
<p>未來的是沒有盡頭的荒路！</p>
<p>不斷地走着，依舊是那麼的恐怖而孤獨；可是天是漸漸地地暗下來了呀，風是漸漸地在厲酷起來了呀。我每一刻鐘都能聽得到這駱駝般的日子的足音，那淸澈而沈鬰的駝鈴；我一天比一天更感到冷冽，衰弱與疲勞了。滯緩的駝鈴與悠長而荒凉的路程把生活渲染得那樣的凄凉而可怕，使我幾乎失掉再走下去的力量了。</p>
<p>砣鈴聲兩聲地響着，日子慢慢地向前爬，就這樣的，慢慢地把人送老來，把人變得萎枯，把人送到最後的歸宿地去。</p>
<p>我看到：在荒凉的沙漠中，駱駝負着上一代人底死屍，向什麼地方走去，而駝鈴則變成了喪鐘，不息地在打出一些不祥的聲音。</p>
<p>初冬的天，已經全黑了，馳想使我恐怖，我彷彿又得了一次惡夢！</p>

<p>黑沉沉的海水，漸漸變成碧綠色，柔靜的閃着綺麗的細波。。海，籠罩上靑靑的，新鮮活潑的神容。厭倦的旅人們的心，泛上陣陣的歡情。</p>
<p>甲板上，船欄上，同伴們那欣躍含笑的聲音：</p>
<p>「出來看喲，多好的山和海……」</p>
<p>傳進鬱悶的艙裏；於是，許多張笑臉，神往的對着異地的島國的海濱，輕輕飄開心扉，吐着甜息的呼吸——第一遭兒初見而呵上！</p>
<p>船，沿着靑山迤逶起伏的曲折的海灣，掠過靜美的海面，慢慢前進。　鐵欄上注視着。羅列得秀　，却低矮得很別緻，有浩船和山離得像很近，人歡手，把幾天來在險惡的風着的這怪特出的靑山抓住。　柔！沒有風浪，傍依山林　無限輕淸。回頭婉視已和灣，灣與山問，小漁舟，石上人，遙遙垂水的綠樹，悠悠自閒的低巧的木屋。前面已出現着兩旁山峽，船朝峽壯奔：霎問幌然山峽在旁，船上人已可見山下臨水處，淸澈澄美的水裏，沙石可數，隱約魚兒影動。兩巖山頭山間，又有高斜如級登的農田，和如人工培植的松林；有濃蔭的蒼幹，有淸秀疎行，高低不一，而各有風采。</p>
<p>有時又谿然而出，兩邊浩曠，急向前望，山渺在遠處，汪洋的海面，沒有浪濤的碧水上，有點點魚舟，有雅巧的小島孤立，這便像個巨湖。看船身平穩壯健的馳駛目的地，這時纔眞實的感着秋高氣爽，太陽光格外柔媚。原來半天紅日，已成斜陽。這時船駛過綠波，兩旁便若垂一巨長的白帶，翻於碧綠的水間，彷彿瀑布。同作們指若遙遙臨水的山傍的黑瓦，木屋，沙灘高呌着：那是水浴塲呵！夏天避暑的去處。島國，是有島國別緻的風姿啦。不由不這麼感想了！</p>

<p>屋子很狹隘，連一個個小小的院落都沒有，窗　稀少，在大門內是不會知道外邊晴或雨的。屋子裏找不到一隻荷花缸，一隻蕙蘭盆，卽使一隻石蒼蒲小盤子亦沒有。這樣陰黯的，述一絲陽光都透不進的室中，委實不適宜於植物的生存了。人在裏面還威着不可言狀的沉鬰呵。</p>
<p>但是，這幾乎是出於意外的發見？我站在灶披的破爛的門框邊，有一種生之眩耀在逗引着，我欣然，我甚至拍手而笑了。</p>
<p>灶披門外原有一條狹小的夾衖，一個瘦身子亦挨不過的。高牆兩邊矗立，瓦礫垃圾腐爛的破布紊亂地散開，潮濕而骯髒；是水鼠，蚯蚓，蝸牛……的繁殖地。我惡聞那種穢臭，我惡見那種腐化，我幾乎每個月都想搬家。今天却就在這穢濁幽黑的地方而發現了一支碧綠色的嫩芽，約二寸左右長，粗如挖耳，頭上有兩片小葉，近根作白色，充份地顯現了生之榮耀。它未受一些穢惡的環境的影響，它如黑海中一株白色的航行標記。它是那麼有勇氣地在險惡中生長着，對於人類有了一個極大的企示：生存是不受環境限制的。</p>
<p>這嫩芽，這生機，我默祝它快快長大，長大……</p>
<p>可是又使我憂慮，那水鼠，那蚯蚓，那蝸牛，那成羣結隊的不知名的骯髒的蟲類，將戕害這小小生機持續的滋長，甚至把它噬掉。而且，這夾弄裏仍沒有太陽光的照臨，植物的萌芽雖可在陰黯潮濕的地方，而其發揚滋長，總少不了溫暖的陽光吧！於是，我將負起那護生的使命。</p>

<p>這回事情太稀奇</p>
<p>我覺得這回事情太稀奇！我覺得這回事情太稀奇！我覺得從來沒有虧待你，我覺得從來沒有得罪你，你為什麼不與我通通音信？你為什麼不與我訴訴情意？綠衣人來鈴兒響，聞得鈴聲我歡喜，人家都有書信到，誰知我信又無朝。望穿了秋波無消息，伸長了頭頸不見你，芙蓉淚兒點點滴滴，我心里滿腔情意，不知從何歌起。</p>
<p>我覺得這回事情太稀奇！我覺得這回事情太稀奇！我覺得當初對我多誠意，我覺得當初對我多知己，你為什麼突然地給我打擊！你為什滬突然地與我別難！回憶當初認識你，嬌小活潑多伶俐，你今長大志氣高，忘却前情投新機。我為你爹娘遠別離，我為你故鄉遠拋棄，肝腸斷似節節寸寸，我一片虔誠心意，誰知不沉海底。</p>

<h3 id="e13">Preparations for the Adoption of Occupational Representation in the National Assembly <a href="#e13" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c13" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">13</a></h3>
<p>— Nian</p>
<p>The Fifth Plenary Session recently approved the review report of the political group, handing over the review opinions on the adoption of occupational representation in the National Assembly to the Central Executive Committee. Although this differs from the provisions of Article 14 of the Founding Program, it is quite in line with Sun Yat-sen's proposal when he went north in the twelfth year, calling for a preparatory meeting for the National Assembly. Mr. Sun advocated that representatives from (1) modern industrial groups, (2) chambers of commerce, (3) educational associations, (4) universities, (5) joint student associations from various provinces, (6) labor unions, (7) agricultural associations, etc., should organize a preparatory meeting for the National Assembly. This already had the intention of using occupational representatives to decide major national issues.</p>
<p>The adoption of occupational representation is an important development in the reform of the representative system in various countries after the European War. The motivation is to increase the status of economic issues in national affairs and to give the production class a special place in national institutions, thereby changing the old-fashioned representative system that uses population and region as election standards. The driving force is the surge of socialism after the war. This system has had a great influence on the newly created constitutions of various countries after the war. The draft constitution drafted by the Shanghai National Affairs Conference in August of the eleventh year and the subsequent drafts of the constitution also referred to it. It cannot be said that there is no considerable historical relationship.</p>
<p>The position of the National Assembly in the Five-Power Constitution is similar to the representative organs of various countries, but in reality it is different. Constitutional scholar Jin Mingsheng has cited four points: (1) It is an agency for the exercise of civil rights, which is different from the British Parliament's agency for the exercise of sovereignty; (2) It is an agency for the exercise of four powers, which is different from the Soviet Congress of Soviets, which is the highest power organ; (3) It is a supervisory agency outside the government, which is different from the US Congress, which is parallel to the government; (4) It is an agency from which the responsibility of the five-yuan government originates, and is not a purely legislative agency, which is different from the nature of the French Parliament. If Mr. Jin's explanation is indeed accurate, then it seems that there is no question that the National Assembly is not suitable for an election system based on population and region, and should adopt occupational representation.</p>
<p>However, occupational representation is mostly adopted concurrently in the constitutions of various countries. Although China has a historical relationship in writing, it has not yet had any actual experience in adoption. Therefore, people must pay attention to the preparations for the adoption of this system in the future. The organization of various occupational groups in China has not yet reached a healthy level in a universal and sufficient way. If they are to elect representatives and take on the heavy burden of organizing the National Assembly, in addition to the Central People's Movement Guidance Committee stepping up its work, the various occupational groups themselves must also make great efforts. This is one. Those who discuss the drawbacks of occupational representation say that when representatives of various occupational groups discuss economic and political issues, their views are difficult to agree on due to their different interests, which may trigger a crisis of mutual struggle. This statement is not unreasonable. How to pay attention in advance when first exploring the use of occupational representation so that these drawbacks do not occur. This is two. Few countries directly and simply adopt occupational representation, because the economic significance of this system is more significant, and there are still problems with ordinary politics. How China will use it now cannot be clearly known. However, how to make occupational representatives adapt to participation in ordinary politics is also something that must be paid attention to. This is three.</p>
<p>The above is not a general discussion on the adoption of occupational representation in the National Assembly. However, preparations before the implementation of a proposal are indeed needed. Maximizing its benefits and eliminating its drawbacks are especially what should be considered when creating a new system. How will our authorities and the people prepare for the implementation of this new system of occupational representation?</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Oshima, a director of Dongtuo, has inspected the situation in Manchuria and North China and has returned to Tokyo on the 16th. At the Dongtuo headquarters, he made a speech on the actual situation, as follows: The Dongtuo enterprise is generally progressing smoothly in Manchuria, but the official start can be said to be in the future. Five or six more gold mines are planned to be opened, and the development of arable land and the operation of various enterprises will have to wait until the transportation network is completed. The situation in North China is very different from that in Manchuria. No matter what enterprise is started, it will not be successful until Japan's national policy is decided first. The Chinese side also wants to clearly know the truth, but North China cannot exercise the planned economy like Manchuria, and the economic method of liberalism will be used. This matter should be true. However, the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese capital and the smooth financing should be the first priority. Therefore, the establishment of the Chinese monetary system should be the top priority. However, judging from the current situation, it is extremely difficult. At present, the bank branches that retain central exchange coupons in North China hold about 28 million yuan in cash, and the people in the five provinces of North China also hold 70 to 80 million yuan. How should this cash be circulated and become capital, and providing Japanese gold to lend out silver dollars is also one of the methods at this time. In short, if a method is decided, there are many enterprises, such as iron mines, coal mines, and cotton planting, which are promising industries. Moreover, there are many more important and indispensable enterprises for the economic development of Japan and Manchuria. The value of North China's economic resources and the value of the commodity market are huge. For the sake of development, Dongtuo can also fulfill its original mission. In any case, it should do its best to serve. Therefore, this matter is expected to be fully studied in the future. (Japanese Associated Press telegram on the 17th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Education of Japan has completed a major statistical report, spanning 21 years from the 45th year of the Meiji era to the 7th year of the Showa era, based on physical examinations of students and children in schools nationwide. The results of the statistics prove the fact that while culture develops, the human body becomes weaker day by day, providing lessons for the future and becoming a major social problem. During these 21 years, the number of people surveyed was 30,059,633 males and 24,959,217 females, totaling a huge number of 55,555,850. To summarize the survey, it is said that height, weight, and chest circumference increase every year. Compared with weight, the increase in chest circumference does not show significant changes in development. Generally, A increases, and C decreases. However, diseases related to physical constitution, such as nearsightedness and tooth decay, have increased dramatically in recent years. Conditions such as trachoma, hunchback, and malnutrition have gradually decreased. In general, although there is considerable progress in physique, on the other hand, physical constitution is declining. In the end, the bodies of young people in general are gradually becoming weak and frail, which is an undeniable trend. (17th United News Telegram)</p>
<h3 id="e30">Economic Sanctions Against Italy to be Implemented by the League of Nations Starting Today. Geneva Figures Believe it Will be Effective. Fascist Party Meeting Decides to Resist. Italian Troops on the Northern Front Halt Attacks for Six Weeks. <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) People here feel that the sanctions against Italy, which will be implemented tomorrow, will definitely be effective. They believe that Italy will feel hardship within a few weeks. There seems to be no consideration of other economic sanctions plans at present. However, there are still several arrows on the League of Nations' bowstring, one of the most powerful being the prohibition of Italian ships from entering ports of countries implementing sanctions. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party held a meeting last night at 10:00 PM, chaired by Prime Minister Mussolini, and adjourned at 12:45 AM. Two resolutions and a declaration were unanimously passed.</p>
<p>The first resolution unanimously praised the Prime Minister, stating, "Any nation has the supreme right to complete the necessary conditions for its own survival. The realization of this right by the Italian nation is all thanks to the Prime Minister's efforts. The Italian people are now united in spirit and are willing to make any sacrifice to achieve their goals." The declaration paid tribute to the Italian troops in East Africa and the former Commander-in-Chief, General De Bono, stating, "Italy has engaged in liberation with weapons and is injecting the immortal culture of Rome into Africa."</p>
<p>The second resolution criticized the sanctions passed by the League of Nations Assembly, stating, "November 18 is the most dishonorable and unjust day, as sanctions have never been implemented against any country before, and now they are being applied exclusively to Italy. The intention is to economically suffocate the Italian people to prevent them from realizing their ideals and maintaining their way of survival. The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party hereby exposes this. All our citizens must resist the sanctions with a strong and unyielding spirit and hang the national flag on this day.</p>
<p>The Supreme Council also resolved as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Resisting sanctions is the primary responsibility of all women nationwide. A meeting of the 94 provincial committees of the "Association of Widows and Mothers of Soldiers Killed in the European War" should be convened in Beijing on December 1 to adjust the resistance movement and intensify resistance efforts.</p>
<p>(2) Italian culture has contributed greatly to various continents, but various countries are responding with unfair means. Therefore, inscriptions should be engraved in front of municipal halls throughout the country to never forget this.</p>
<p>(3) Express sympathy to countries that refuse to participate in the sanctions. It concluded by saying that the Italian nation possesses the virtues of ancient Rome, which the world will know after this test. [Signed] Year 14 of the Fascist Era, month, day." Residents of Naples had previously proposed that the day of the sanctions be called the "Beginning of Economic Siege." The Supreme Council of the Fascist Party may implement this proposal, and Italy, from November 18, will also enter a state of isolation from all countries in the world. Currently, notices have been posted everywhere in the country, urging citizens to boycott foreign goods, with those who violate this being considered traitors. This is indeed the natural result of Italy's commercial policy. (17th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) General Badoglio, Chief of Staff of the Italian Army, has replaced General De Bono as Special Commissioner for East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Italian Army. Italian troops on the northern front in Africa have changed their strategy and halted their offensive. It is expected that the northern army will halt attacks for at least six weeks. The Italian army hopes to complete the road during this period so that tanks can advance and charge from the rear. Currently, many troops at the front cannot receive supplies through wheeled transport and rely on air transport. Today, the government ordered the recall of all junior officers of the 1907 to 1910 and 1912 classes, as well as some artillery and other specialist soldiers, into service. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Harar: According to sources from Africa, there has been heavy rain in recent days, which has greatly helped the African army. The Italian army's advance along the Fafan River towards Jijiga has been greatly hampered. Dozens of tanks are stuck in the wet mud and cannot move. The number of soldiers suffering from fever is increasing daily. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Rome) As the Italian and Ethiopian armies are about to begin a major battle, the government has specially appointed General Badoglio, Chief of Staff of the Army, to succeed General De Bono as High Commissioner for East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force. This is actually the initial stage of the second phase of the war. According to the first phase of the war, its purpose was to wipe away the shame of the defeat at Adowa in 1896. This task has been completed by General De Bono. De Bono is an old member of the Fascist Party and, together with Prime Minister Mussolini and three others, led party members to occupy Rome. Now that he has captured Adowa in one battle, the Fascist Party has wiped away the shame of the past, and De Bono has also completed his mission. From now on, the Italian army will face significant resistance from the Ethiopian army in terms of tactics. Therefore, it is more appropriate for General Badoglio, the national military commander, to take the lead. (16th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The newly appointed High Commissioner for East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, General Badoglio, is one of Italy's most famous military strategists, unanimously recognized throughout the country. The general was born in 1871 and participated in the war against Ethiopia in 1896-97, and also fought in the Italian colony of Libya in 1912. The Italian army's victory in the Battle of Suer at that time was largely due to his efforts. Two years later, when the European War broke out, he participated in the war as Chief of Staff of the 27th Army. In 1917, he was promoted to Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army. After the war, he was appointed Chief of Staff. From 1924 to 1925, he was sent to Brazil as an envoy. In 1926, he was promoted to General of the Army and Chief of Staff. In 1929, he was transferred to serve as Governor of Libya, where he used both suppression and appeasement to achieve success. In 1934, he was recalled to the country, and his vacancy was succeeded by Air Force General Balbo. When the government decided on the East African war, it consulted him for his opinion. It is said that he frankly stated that this war required great efforts in military and financial terms to be beneficial to the government. Therefore, before the war, he made meticulous preparations and sent a large army to East Africa, the size of which was rarely seen in colonial wars. The government's decision to appoint him as High Commissioner for East Africa and Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force was made three days ago. (16th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) General Badoglio has been appointed to completely command the Italian troops in East Africa. After the General arrives in Africa, the Italian army will launch a large-scale offensive with a swift strategy. According to reliable sources, one route of the attacking army will be based in Magal and will take Amba Alagi, 50 miles away, to the south, while another route will depart from the Tacazze River and strike directly at Gondar and Lake Tsana. Italian generals expect Ethiopia to increase its military strength in the north to resist, thus the southern defenses will become empty, and General Graziani will be able to take the opportunity to occupy Harar. As for the sudden change of commanders, it is to give Italy's most capable strategist the opportunity to deal with Ethiopia's initial determined resistance, to capture Harar, Dessie, and Gondar with one blow, and incorporate them all into Italian territory. After success, the Italian army can build transportation and communication routes. Italian newspapers say that the Italian outposts are now only 31 miles away from Gondar. On the one hand, they are buying camels in large quantities, and new troops and military supplies are being shipped out of Naples, proving that the attack plan is certain. Reliable sources also say that the reason why General De Bono was appointed as Commander of the Italian Army in East Africa and was awarded the honor of occupying Adowa and other places was because he was old and had followed Mussolini for many years, so he was ordered to establish special achievements and then retire. Now that General De Bono's great achievements have been established and the future of Europe is gradually returning to silence, Italy also dares to use its most capable talents to command the entire army in order to end the Ethiopian military operation in the shortest possible time. (16th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(London) Military experts here commented on the Italian government's appointment of Army Chief of Staff General Badoglio as Commander-in-Chief of the Expeditionary Force, saying that its intention is to launch an offensive as soon as possible before the next two seasons in Ethiopia to determine the final victory. However, the strategy adopted by the Italian army is very dangerous. As the Green Italian army penetrates deep into the Ethiopian hinterland, its communication lines will be extended, and the Ethiopian army will inevitably engage in interception with small units, especially in areas where roads are rugged and forests are dense.

<h3 id="e35">Hoover Attacks Roosevelt. Says He is Playing with National Fortune. Criticizes His Monetary Policy <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>(New York) Republican leader and former President Hoover gave a speech at the Ohio Society last night, criticizing President Roosevelt's monetary and financial policies, saying that he is "playing with national fortune." He also put forward eleven points of political program, advocating the restoration of the gold standard. Among them, he strongly criticized the current government's silver purchase policy. He said, "We are subsidizing foreign silver speculators, as well as silver mine owners in Australia, India, Mexico, and Peru. This is probably what those who advocate a good-neighbor policy should do. What is even more, we are causing turmoil in the currencies of China and other silver-using countries, causing the bankruptcy of many industries, creating labor disputes, and playing with their living standards in the palm of our hand. All of this is to encourage their friendship with the United States. This is also what those who advocate a good-neighbor policy should do." Some people interpret this speech as Hoover's intention to lead the Republican Party again and to put forward his candidacy in the next presidential election. (16th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(New York) Former President Hoover gave a speech to the Ohio Society today, severely criticizing the government's purchase of foreign silver and saying that the United States' currency has a cash reserve of $1.80 per dollar, so there is no need to add more metal reserves. However, the government deliberately raised the price of foreign silver by more than 50% and purchased it in large quantities, which is actually useless and only allows foreigners to gain huge profits. The government has spent 250 million yuan for this purpose, and according to the newly established economic policy, it will have to spend another 1 billion yuan. Foreigners will certainly not take back silver at this high price. Therefore, if the United States does not use tax revenue to make up for this huge deficit, it will have to implement currency inflation. Although Mr. Hoover himself has no plan, he requires a complete change in the current financial and monetary policies to avoid falling into an uncontrollable state of currency inflation. He also suggested returning to the gold standard, even if the system is revised, it is not impossible, but the President's power to inflate the currency must be overturned. Mr. Hoover defended his previous government, saying that the economic collapse in 1929 was the result of the Federal Reserve's expansion of bank credit in 1927, which he personally strongly opposed. By 1931, Europe could no longer maintain it, but the United States was still able to save the situation and prevent the world from falling into chaos. The credit expansion implemented by the New Deal is three or four times greater than that of 1927. Although the government claims that this expansion can be controlled, once political control fails, the democratic system of the United States may not be able to withstand this blow.

<p>Record of a Visit to Beibei (Part 2)</p>
<p>4.  The Western China Science Institute: The institute was established in the autumn of 1930 and was founded single-handedly by Mr. Lu Zuofu. A board of directors was formed, with Mr. Liu Xiang, the current chairman of the Sichuan Provincial Government, as chairman, and Mr. Lu Zuofu as president. The institute has four research institutes: biology, physics and chemistry, agriculture and forestry, and geology. The Biology Institute has a botanical garden and a zoo. The botanical garden has more than one hundred species of fruit seedlings, totaling more than six thousand plants. The nursery covers an area of about twenty acres and has more than one hundred species of forest seedlings, totaling more than three hundred thousand plants. There are more than eight thousand bulbs of the lily family, orchid family, and bulbous plants. The zoo has dozens of species such as bears, tigers, leopards, and foxes. There were originally two leopards, each eating five catties of beef a day. Now, for the sake of saving provincial expenses, one is kept, and the other was shot and made into a specimen, which is displayed in the museum, all of which are located in the Civilian Park. Many people visit every day. The main research work of the institute is to collect animal, plant, and insect specimens from various provinces in western China, totaling 11,799 plant specimens with more than 50,000 copies, and 5,740 plant specimens from various provinces and regions of China exchanged from various research institutions. There are a total of 2,260 animal specimens and more than 30,000 insect specimens.</p>
<p>The main work of the Institute of Physics and Chemistry is to collect and solicit samples of minerals and industrial raw materials from various places for chemical testing. In the past, it has collected 258 kinds of coal mines from the Jialing River and the border areas of eastern Sichuan and western Hubei, and more than 140 kinds of other minerals for chemical testing, and compiled a general report on coal chemical testing, which is listed as one of the institute's publications.</p>
<p>The Institute of Agriculture and Forestry is located in Shangba, Dongyang Town, Jiangbei, and has two agricultural farms, one in Dongyang Town, covering an area of 116 acres, and one in Xishanping, covering an area of more than 2,500 acres, which was reclaimed from wasteland. It is said that the Dongyang Town agricultural farm is used for vegetable, horticulture, fruit tree breeding, and crop testing. The Xishanping agricultural farm is used for forestry, fruit trees, crops, and animal husbandry. Unfortunately, due to rain, I was unable to visit.</p>
<p>The Geological Institute was formally established in 1932. The main task is to investigate the geology of Sichuan Province. The counties that have been investigated are Jiangbei, Linyong, Dazhu, Qu County, Guang'an, Hechuan, Tongnan, Tongliang, Bishan, and Yongchuan. The Geology of the Area between Chongqing and Nanchuan and the Geology of the Three Gorges of the Jialing River in Sichuan have been compiled and published.</p>
<p>In addition to the above four major research projects, there are three affiliated projects: (1) Museum, (2) Public Library, (3) Jianshan School. The museum is located in Beibei Civilian Park and was formally established in 1930. It is divided into two parts: the exhibition room and the zoo, and also has an affiliated Hechuan Science Museum. The regular monthly expenses are about 400 yuan. The exhibition room is divided into sections for local customs, hygiene, coal mines, products of the Three Gorges area, currency, and industrial arts, and is located in Beibei Civilian Park, local hospitals, Hechuan Science Museum, and various tea houses in Beibei City. There are more than 3,490 exhibits and more than 1,000 landscape photos from various places. Among them, the local customs exhibition room is the most valuable for research, especially the customs of Xikang, most of which were collected by the museum staff who went to Xikang in person. There are many Buddhist statues from Xikang on display. According to people in the museum, people in Xikang are very devout Buddhists and must offer food to the Buddha at every meal, and they carry Buddhist statues with them. Also, most people in Xikang are illiterate. The "horse cards" used by the government (similar to the documents currently in use), such as ordering local officials to supply cattle and horses, will draw several heads of cattle and several heads of horses on the horse card, and the local officials will allocate them accordingly. The zoo is located in the Civilian Park for public viewing. The public library has more than 16,000 books, more than 140 kinds of magazines, and more than 20 kinds of newspapers. There is a reading room, four reference rooms, a special research collection room, and four modern knowledge exhibitions. Among them, the modern knowledge exhibition is the most eye-catching, because it uses pictures and simple literature to show the audience where China's weaknesses lie.</p>
<p>Jianshan School was also founded in 1930 and is divided into junior high school and elementary school. There are about 200 students. Although the environment is good, it is difficult to develop due to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>5.  The Three Gorges Dyeing and Weaving Factory: The economic construction projects in Beibei District include the Three Gorges Dyeing and Weaving Factory, the Beichuan Railway Company, the Tianfu Coal Mine Company, the Qiyuan Coal Mine Company, the Suichuan Coal Mine Company, the Jialing Coal Ball Factory, the Huoxu Cave Hydroelectric Plant, the Natural Battery Factory, the Fuyuan Hydroelectric Plant, the Jingangbei Steelmaking Plant, the Fuhua Iron Factory, the Sheng Jingzhi Iron Factory, the Huili Match Factory, the Hongji Ice Factory, and the Lihua Glass Factory. Except for the Three Gorges Dyeing and Weaving Factory and the Tianfu Coal Mine Company, the rest are very small in scale. Some have a capital of only 5,000 yuan. Most coal mines are also mined using old methods. Due to time constraints, the reporter only visited the Three Gorges Dyeing and Weaving Factory, the Beichuan Railway, the Tianfu Coal Mine Company, and the Jialing Coal Ball Factory. The Three Gorges Dyeing and Weaving Factory is near the Gorges Defense Bureau. It originally belonged to the Gorges Defense Bureau and was reorganized and independent in the autumn of 1930. The factory has fixed assets of 109,300 yuan and current assets of 87,000 yuan. It has four departments: power, sizing and bleaching, reeling, and weaving. There are 106 male workers and 84 female workers. One part is still woven with hand-operated machines. The products include various colors of Gorges wool, Luo Fu wool, Freedom wool, Zhongshan wool, stuffed wool, towel cloth, honeycomb cloth, etc., which are sold in Chongqing, Chengdu, Xufu, Luzhou, Guang'an, Shunqing, Hechuan, Beibei, and other places. The prices are more expensive than those produced by various factories in Shanghai. The average working hours for workers are about 12 hours per day, and the wages range from one dime to three dimes. The air circulation inside is still hygienic.</p>
<p>6.  Beichuan Railway: The Beichuan Railway is the only light railway in Sichuan. The entire line is more than thirty miles long. Construction began in 1928, and the section from Shuilan'e to Tudi'e began operation in October 1929. The entire project was presided over by Danish engineer Mr. Shou Erz. The starting point of the railway is built on the cliffs by the Jialing River. When passing by boat, you can sometimes hear the sound of the whistle. If you look up from the boat, you can see a train winding through the sky. If you look down from the car, you will see that there is no land below, which makes people feel uneasy. The reporter took the Beichuan Railway train back and forth once and saw that the track laying was narrower than the ordinary railway and the car traveled quite slowly, and the bumps were more severe than ordinary passenger cars. Because the railway is a light railway, its main purpose of construction is to transport coal. The annual surplus is more than 17,000 yuan.</p>
<p>7.  Tianfu Coal Mine Company: It is said that the company was formed by merging several old small factories. The current capital is 240,000 yuan, part of which is the factory price of the old factories merged, and part of which is newly raised capital. The mining area is about fifteen miles, and the mining areas from Maliuwan to Daijiagou are all owned by the company. According to Engineer Min of the company, the company is still using indigenous methods for mining and the sales are not wide, so it is still losing money. The company originally had six factories, but only four are still operating. The reasons are (1) supply exceeds demand, (2) the production cost of the other two factories is too high. The company's coal area can be divided into two types: (1) Permian, growing in limestone cliffs, the thickest coal seam reaches 15 feet, which can be used for coking (the coal produced in the entire Sichuan Province, only Jiangbei, Nanchuan, and Peng County can be coked), but the quality of Permian coal is not good and cannot be used for ships, (2) Jurassic, which is everywhere, the thickest coal seam is about one and a half feet, produced in sandstone cliffs, and the quality is very good. Currently, the company can produce 300 tons of coal per day. The price per ton is six yuan for foamy lump coal, five yuan for hard lump coal, four yuan for foamy coal, and three yuan and five dimes for hard coal. But the above is only the price at the Baimiaozi station. Each ton needs to add about eight yuan for transportation fees. The company has more than 300 direct workers, and about 2,000 people including indirect workers. In addition to Tianfu Coal Mine, there is also the Sancai Shenggu Joint Stock Company in Baimiaozi Coal Mine. The organization is very old-fashioned, with a capital of 200,000, and it is also losing money. The reason is also that the mining method is poor and the transportation cost is too high. Now, we can only try our best to tighten our belts in order to survive.</p>
<p>The reporter stayed in Beibei and Wenquan Park for four days. What I saw and heard made me feel that the spirit of autonomy and talent training in Beibei District are quite worthy of being a mirror for rural construction in other provinces. However, the modernization of production methods is what Beibei and even the entire Sichuan Province urgently need to pursue.</p>
<h3 id="e63">Repairs to Collapsed Dikes of the Yangtze and Han Rivers to Commence Within the Month <a href="#e63" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c63" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">63</a></h3>
<p>Construction plans have been reviewed and approved, and large sums of money have been allocated. The main dikes will use labor relief, and the people's dikes will use compulsory labor.</p>
<p>A Hankou dispatch states that the authorities have been planning to repair the collapsed dikes of the Yangtze and Han Rivers for some time, but work has not yet begun. Not only is the dry winter season passing, but the disaster victims who are eagerly awaiting work relief are also crying for hunger and cold, which is too late to remedy. It was found that after the flood occurred, a joint meeting was held on August 2 by four agencies: the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Construction, the Flood Relief Association, and the Yangtze-Han Engineering Bureau to discuss the dike repair methods and decided on two principles: (1) Recruit refugees in the disaster-stricken areas for work relief; (2) In areas with autumn harvests, conscript labor for embankment repair according to the people's compulsory labor method, and divide responsibilities. The investigation and statistics of the dikes and embankments in the province will be handled by the Department of Construction in conjunction with the Yangtze-Han Engineering Bureau. The embankment repair, inspection, and rectification will be fully responsible by the Yangtze-Han Engineering Bureau. The authorities' steps were consistent, and the planning was not too early. However, the degree of damage to dikes and embankments in various places exceeded that of the past twenty years, and the scale of the project was also incomparable to that of the past twenty years. The central government's relief funds are less than those of the past twenty years, and the approved construction funds have not been allocated for a long time, which has delayed the start of construction. This is the biggest reason. Secondly, the large number of collapsed dikes, which ones should be repaired by the government, which ones should be repaired by the people, which ones should be repaired, and which ones should be abandoned, and the issues of which should be repaired first and which should be repaired later, also need to be thoroughly investigated and carefully designed, which is also one of the reasons for the delayed start of construction. After taking office, Xi Dejiong, Director of the Yangtze-Han Engineering Bureau, immediately convened a meeting of the heads of various engineering offices and engineers to discuss and determine the construction plan. Pu Deli, a consultant from the Water Conservancy Department of the Economic Commission, and Section Chief Wang Hu came to Hankou to review and approve it. Because the funds needed were too large, Xi took the plan to the capital for instructions. Recently, the Economic Commission decided to implement it. The content of the plan focuses on repairing the collapsed openings, followed by repairs. In terms of the main dikes alone, a total of more than 6 million yuan is needed for labor and materials. The collapsed openings of the Xiang River Third and Fourth Works dikes require more than 2 million yuan, and the Eleventh Works and other collapsed openings require more than 3 million yuan. In addition to the provincial dike engineering funds, which can cover 2 million yuan, the Economic Commission has approved the allocation of 2 million yuan. The remaining 2 million yuan will be requested from the central government to be allocated from the Hubei Province work relief funds. Since the funds have been raised, construction is not very difficult. Shi Yuling, the Sixth District Administrative Commissioner, has recruited 100,000 civilians to be responsible for repairing the collapsed openings of the Third and Fourth Works dikes and the remote dikes. The food is also prepared by the Flood Relief Association. It is expected to officially start construction within this month. For the people's dikes, there are a total of 36 counties with dikes, and the number of dikes and embankments is uncertain. According to the results of the current investigation by dispatched personnel, the number is dozens for the small ones and hundreds for the large ones. The number can be said to be alarming. This year's flood was huge, and none of them survived. At least 10 million yuan is needed for repairs. Generally, the people will be responsible for the repairs through compulsory labor, supplemented by work relief. The required food expenses will also be covered. Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Provincial Government, has repeatedly requested assistance from the central government in the capital and has reportedly been approved. Therefore, the construction of the people's dikes will be carried out simultaneously with the main dikes and will be completed before May next year. (15th)</p>
<h3 id="e64">The Nature of League of Nations Sanctions <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>— Ang Ruo</p>
<p>If there are no other changes, the economic sanctions imposed by the League of Nations on Italy will begin to be implemented on the 18th of this month. This is an unprecedented move since the establishment of the League of Nations on January 16, 1920, and also a precedent for collective action to punish warmongers. However, the issue of sanctions is very complex and has led to misunderstandings among the general public. The nature of sanctions and the legal basis for their implementation are analyzed below.</p>
<p>"Sanction" is a legal term, meaning to force lawbreakers to obey the law. The spirit of the law lies in the use of public power to implement sanctions after proper inquiry, and not by arbitrary enforcement by one person. The difference between this rule of law in the international sphere and within a nation lies in the absence of a strict legal code like national law in the international sphere. In the international arena, since 1920, the meaning of the rule of law has been twofold: (1) to abide by international treaties, and (2) to resolve any disputes between friendly nations through agreement or other legal procedures, rather than resorting to war. These principles are enshrined in the Covenant of the League of Nations, and member states that sign the Covenant have the responsibility to implement these principles.</p>
<p>But in addition to stating these principles, the Covenant also contains more advanced provisions. Articles 10, 11, 13(4), 15(6, 7), and 16 of the Covenant stipulate the measures the League of Nations should take to prevent those who intend to or actually violate the Covenant.</p>
<p>Article 10 stipulates that "The Members of the League undertake to respect and preserve as against external aggression the territorial integrity and existing political independence of all Members of the League. In case of any such aggression or in case of any threat or danger of such aggression the Council shall advise upon the means by which this obligation shall be fulfilled." This is a general article applicable to threats of aggression and actual aggression. The specific methods to be adopted for any particular case shall be planned by the Council. There is nothing to prevent the Council from recommending the adoption of some or all of the sanctions stipulated in Article 16. However, in the absence of other express provisions regarding this article and other articles (such as Article 15(6, 7) and Article 16), the resolutions of the Council of the League of Nations must be unanimous.</p>
<p>Article 16 stipulates the methods for implementing sanctions against warmongers. The condition for implementation is that a country "resorts to war in disregard of its covenants under Articles 12, 13 or 15, it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to" expressly stated sanctions. However, in order to implement Article 16, war must have actually broken out.</p>
<p>Articles 10 and 11 allow for action to be taken in the event of a danger of war or when war has already broken out, without any expressly stipulated measures. Article 10 has already been discussed. Article 11 declares that any war or danger of war is a matter of concern to the entire league. "The League shall take any action that may be deemed wise and effectual to safeguard the peace of nations." The wording is very broad. The Legal Section of the Thirteenth Committee, in its report, cited the opinion of the Council Committee of 1927, "allowing the adoption of any measures other than war to deal with recalcitrant states." According to the Legal Section's opinion, any measures adopted under this article should be of a preventive nature. Furthermore, in the absence of specific agreements, states are not legally obliged to comply with the Council's recommendations. The measures in this article differ from those in Article 16, which stipulates that sanctions should be imposed on a state that resorts to war in violation of the Covenant.</p>
<p>According to Article 13(4), if the Council encounters a state that fails to implement a judgment, "the Council shall propose what steps should be taken to give effect thereto." According to the Legal Section's opinion, any measures implemented under this article must be limited to achieving this objective.</p>
<p>Article 15(6, 7) stipulates passive sanctions, which means that if the Council's report, excluding the representative(s) of one or more of the parties to the dispute, is unanimously approved by the members of the Council, then the members of the League agree "that they will not go to war with any party to the dispute which complies with the recommendations of the report."</p>
<p>Before studying the difficult issues of interpreting and implementing sanctions, the nature of the various sanctions should be analyzed. Sanctions can be divided into four categories: (1) moral and diplomatic measures, (2) financial and economic measures, (3) international boycotts, and (4) military measures. There is an important divide between the above four types of sanctions, namely, that the first two types of measures against the violating country will not involve combat, but if the violating country actively resists the latter two types of measures, it will inevitably lead to war. This point will be examined in more detail later.</p>
<p>Public opinion is one type of moral sanction, and it is bound to exert considerable power. Public opinion within the aggressor country may be deceived by government propaganda, but the unanimous global opposition to the aggressor country cannot be completely ignored. Credit depends on trust, and trust can be undermined by foreign criticism. But public opinion is difficult to be effective without concrete actions to back it up. Concrete actions can be expressed through diplomatic channels, such as warnings, protests, withdrawal of diplomatic representatives, and severance of diplomatic relations. These measures have both advantages and disadvantages. There is also the measure of non-recognition (such as the note to Japan by US Secretary of State Stimson on January 7, 1932 regarding the Manchurian problem, and the resolution passed by the General Assembly of the League of Nations on March 11 of the same year).</p>
<p>The second category of financial and economic sanctions varies in severity. Financial sanctions come in three forms: stopping long-term loans, short-term bank credit loans, and commercial credit accounts. Financial sanctions, when implemented in a timely manner, can be effective and easy to implement, without a broad impact on the implementing countries, but they also have weaknesses. The sanctioned country can use it to cancel foreign debts as retaliation. In addition, there are measures to provide financial assistance to the aggressed country. The Financial Assistance Convention was established in 1930 (signed by 30 countries, including the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, the Little Entente countries, and the Scandinavian countries), but it has not yet been implemented. If this convention were effective, the aggressed country would have the opportunity to obtain financial assistance from other members of the League of Nations, and the aggressor country would have to think twice before acting.</p>
<p>Before discussing economic sanctions, the distinction between passive and challenging measures should be made. The League of Nations can recommend prohibiting the export of military supplies and strategic raw materials. All member states can unanimously agree to implement the prohibition within their own countries. However, if the military supply producing countries that are not members of the League of Nations do not act in concert, the prohibition cannot be thorough. In this case, the League of Nations has to decide whether to implement a blockade, and if the aggressor country wants to break through this blockade, it will inevitably lead to war, and even disputes with non-member states are possible.</p>
<p>However, there are many measures that can be taken before implementing the harsh measure of a blockade. The unanimous boycott of goods from the aggressor country by many countries can have a significant impact. It is easier to implement a ban on imports in the sanctioning countries than a ban on exports. In terms of administration, it is easier to verify the origin of goods than to verify the destination. It can be done without a blockade, and its power is sufficient to deprive the aggressor country of foreign exchange—this loss in itself is very serious and can hinder the aggressor country from purchasing goods from other sources.</p>
<p>As for the prohibition of exports, the most important thing to implement is of course weapons, ammunition, and military supplies. There are considerable difficulties in implementation. First, it has always been difficult to agree on who is the true warmonger, which is also the crux of the entire sanction issue. Second, there have always been different opinions on whether the two parties in conflict should be prohibited from exporting at the same time. For example, in the Sino-Japanese issue, the United Kingdom initiated a joint ban on both parties, but other countries did not agree, and the ban was lifted after only two weeks. In the Italian-Ethiopian dispute, some countries banned both parties. After the General Assembly of the League of Nations passed the resolution on sanctions against Italy on October 9, 50 member states had lifted the ban on Ethiopia.</p>
<p>Whether the prohibition of military supplies is effective depends entirely on whether the sanctioned country is a producer, and whether the prohibition has loopholes. The attitude of producing countries that are not members of the League of Nations is also very important. For producing and highly industrialized countries, it is only effective to prohibit key raw materials at the same time. However, countries that deliberately commit aggression must have stockpiled these types of raw materials long ago. However, in the current era of increasing specialization and mechanization, a country's military strength is also increasingly dependent on various commodities. Therefore, the effectiveness of economic sanctions is also considerable.</p>
<p>Now, let us study the sanctions stipulated in Article 16 of the Covenant, namely the international boycott in Article 16(1) and the military sanctions in Articles 16(2, 3). The interpretation of this article will be discussed later. Now, let us first study its measures. The most important point to note is that Article 16 can only be implemented after a country has disregarded the Covenant and resorted to war.</p>
<p>In this case, "it shall ipso facto be deemed to have committed an act of war against all other Members of the League, which hereby undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not."</p>
<p>If the international boycott can be universally implemented in accordance with the original intentions of the drafters of the Covenant, it will definitely be effective. If the sanctioned country resists, and all countries are prepared to back it up with blockades or military action, the effectiveness will be even greater. In this regard, the major powers that are not members of the League of Nations are in a very important position. Even if all members of the League of Nations unanimously implement the international boycott, it is not without doubt. The extent to which countries rely on foreign trade varies, and the impact of this boycott also varies accordingly. Moreover, it is generally believed that no country can be immune to the damage of a thorough boycott.</p>
<p>In order for a boycott to be completely effective, it must be able to completely close the border, sever all postal, telegraphic, shipping, and aviation links, withdraw all consular personnel, and even detain or repatriate the nationals of the boycotted country.</p>
<p>The implementation of these measures will inevitably raise a number of questions. The resistance of the sanctioned country to the blockade will inevitably lead to military action and combat measures. The attitude of non-member states of the League of Nations must be considered. In addition, neighboring countries, especially small and weak countries, will be in a very difficult situation, and special measures must be taken to protect their status, so that they are exempted from participating in the boycott or protect their national defense. There is also the issue of compensation. The damage caused by the boycott varies, and countries with less damage should compensate countries with more damage. In this regard, Article 16(3) stipulates that "The Members of the League agree, further, that they will mutually support one another in the financial and economic measures which are taken under this Article, in order to minimise the loss and inconvenience resulting therefrom."</p>
<p>Article 16(2) stipulates that "It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League." According to paragraph 3, the members of the League also agree that "they will take the necessary steps to afford passage through their territory to the forces of any of the Members of the League which are co-operating to protect the covenants of the League."</p>
<p>In practice, how military measures are to be implemented is not expressly stipulated. In some cases, the Council of the League of Nations may designate one or more countries to take military, naval, and air force action. The Council may also recommend that member states send troops to form a League of Nations army. The voluntary recruitment of this international army will inevitably delay the timing, and the designation of the supreme command is also a difficult issue. The League of Nations' hosting of the formation of an international peacekeeping force has been initiated by several countries, but it is still far from being mature.</p>
<p>Therefore, military sanction measures must be determined according to the specific circumstances of each case, and the geographical environment is a particularly important factor. In practice, some countries will not be limited to the provisions of Article 16 of the Covenant, and will inevitably be drawn into the vortex of war, and will have to do their best to deal with it.</p>
<p>The implementation of Article 16 and the rights and obligations of member states of the League of Nations have raised important questions of interpretation. In this regard, the opinions of jurists are often inconsistent. However, the resolutions passed by the Second General Assembly of the League of Nations in October 1921 can serve as a basis. The first resolution stipulates that "It is for the government of each Member to decide whether a breach of the Covenant has been committed," which means that the implementation of Article 16 is automatic, that is, if a country disregards the Covenant and resorts to war, and each member state of the League of Nations has determined this fact on its own, the member state has a responsibility to take military action, but this responsibility is not mandatory. The fourth resolution states that "The Members of the League are bound to take the necessary measures to carry out the obligations which devolve upon them in virtue of this Article; any omission is tantamount to a breach of the Covenant." However, if a country has decided that the Covenant has not been breached, the recommendations of the Council of the League of Nations are invalid, and the country cannot be forced to implement sanctions.</p>
<p>The fifth resolution stipulates that any case of breach of the Covenant under Article 16 "shall be brought before the Council as a matter of urgency at the request of any Member of the League." The Secretary-General shall immediately notify all members of the Council, convene a meeting as soon as possible to study the case, and make recommendations. If the Council considers that the Covenant has been breached, then according to the sixth resolution, the minutes shall be submitted to all members of the League of Nations, together with a written explanation and a notice of action to be taken. Other resolutions stipulate that the Council may form a committee of experts to assist in the handling of the matter, and the Council shall recommend the date on which the economic sanctions of Article 16 should begin to be implemented, and shall be responsible for notifying all members. If the economic sanctions are extended, then gradual and more stringent measures must be taken, and the prohibition of food supply is the last step, and efforts must be made to ensure the cooperation of countries that are not members of the League of Nations.</p>
<p>The importance of these resolutions lies in the clear stipulation that they do not interfere with national sovereignty, that the sanction action is joint, not individual, and that the measures stipulated in Article 16 do not have to be implemented immediately and simultaneously, but can be implemented in stages.</p>
<p>Regarding the interpretation of economic sanctions, experts still have a different point of view. One side believes that the economic sanctions of Article 16 must be a complete boycott of the breaching country and its people. This boycott must be passive, and all countries are limited to stopping all interactions. But it must also be active, and all countries should actively prohibit the breaching country from interacting with any member state and non-member state.</p>
<p>The other side believes that, based on the Kellogg-Briand Pact, the economic sanctions stipulated in Article 16 only require each member state to implement them within its own territory. Member states of the League of Nations are not responsible for taking action outside their own borders and implementing a blockade. However, in this regard, it is very clear that the boycott can only be effective if all countries can implement it within their own territory.</p>
<p>The key to the success of sanctions lies in the concentration of all the strength of the League of Nations members to deal with the aggressor country. The drafters of the Covenant thought that the League of Nations was a worldwide organization, and that the power of the whole world to deal with an aggressor country would surely make it yield. However, as British Foreign Secretary Hoare stated in Geneva on September 11, the League of Nations has lacked several major powers as members from the beginning, and other countries have since withdrawn. However, the responsibilities of the Covenant still exist, and the burden on the countries that remain in the League of Nations has greatly increased as a result.</p>

<h3 id="e65">The Qiantang River Bridge at Yingkou <a href="#e65" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c65" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">65</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Changren</p>
<p>Having visited Hangzhou and traveled in the lakes and mountains for two days, I went to admire the Temple of Yue Fei, and visited the many scenic spots of Lingyin and Taoguang. Following the mountain road behind Longjing Temple, I twisted and turned to explore the Nine Streams and Eighteen Gorges. Although the camellias were old, the pines and bamboos remained the same, the verdant color assaulted the senses, and my face felt refreshed. The quiet mountain road, the stream water, sometimes passed through stones and over paths, murmuring under my feet... it was like being in a painting. When I arrived at the Jiuxi Tea Plantation, I originally planned to pass through Yangmeiling Manjuelong to peek at the Shuile Cave, Yanhua Cave, and Stone House Cave. However, I heard that the Qiantang River Bridge was under major construction, with the goal of completing it in the shortest possible time, in order to connect the traffic of the two Zhejiang provinces, so I changed course and went bravely. The north end of the Qiantang River Bridge is located between Zhakou and the Liuhe Pagoda. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway extends here and stops. The Hangzhou-Fuyang Highway starts from here and goes west along the river. Once completed, it will have special value in both commerce and national defense.</p>
<p>Because of the construction of the bridge, this once desolate riverside has been transformed into a small industrial area. Building materials are everywhere, and there are no less than a hundred tall and complete workshops. The voices of workers shouting and the sound of machinery operating are mixed together. The riverside revetment has been built, and three or five bridge piers for the approach bridge have also been completed. They are tall and solid, unlike anything I have seen before. There is a temporary bridge about a hundred feet long on the embankment, to reach the first bridge pier in the river, which is more than half built. Light railways are laid on it, and the workers' access and the transportation of materials all rely on it. The construction of this temporary bridge is also not easy, and it will gradually extend from both banks to the center of the river as the bridge piers are built one by one.</p>
<p>According to Mr. Sun Baochu, one of the Chinese engineers, the construction of this bridge started with a groundbreaking ceremony on November 11 last year. The Danish company Kang Yiyang, to which he belongs, contracted to build the bridge piers. The total construction cost is about 5 million yuan. In February of this year, the foreign company began to transport the means of production and building materials one after another, and started work. It was originally scheduled to be completed in one year, but unfortunately, due to the floods, the entire embankment project that had been completed was destroyed. The reconstruction began in February. There are currently more than a thousand workers working, and it is planned to add more people later. However, it will not be possible to complete it by this time next year—early November.</p>
<p>The bridge is about 5,000 feet long, with a net length of 3,520 feet. There are 15 bridge piers, divided into 16 spans, each span 220 feet. There are approach bridges at both ends, totaling more than 1,000 feet. The bridge body is divided into two layers. The lower layer is used to lay the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway, and the upper layer is the highway. The net width of the bridge body is 17 feet, with 5-foot sidewalks on both sides of the upper layer. The center distance between the two beams is 20 feet.</p>
<p>The depth of the Qiantang River at this point is about 70 feet at the shallowest point, and the lowest point is 150 to 160 feet below the Wusong zero point. The water surface rises and falls by 15 feet due to the tide. The riverbed is sandy and undulating. Generally speaking, the stone layer in the north is higher than in the south. Among the 15 bridge piers, the six northern ones can be directly dug and placed on the stone layer at the bottom of the river. The other nine piers, because the riverbed is too muddy, use the pneumatic caisson method to establish the bridge piers on wooden piles or stone layers about 100 feet below the erosion line at the bottom of the river. All bridge piers are currently using this method.</p>
<p>Using the pneumatic caisson method to build bridge piers is the first time in China. The caisson has only five sides, 58 feet long, 37 feet wide, and 20 feet high, all made of reinforced concrete. During construction, after the cofferdam is built, the caisson is first placed on the riverbed, and then an elliptical reinforced concrete pier column is built on it. The top of the caisson has inlet and outlet holes, and the steam pipes from the three air compressors on the shore pass through these holes to enter the caisson, in order to input high-pressure air to prevent mud and water from entering, and to prevent the caisson from sinking immediately. The workers then carry out excavation work in the caisson. From then on, as the sand and soil at the bottom of the caisson are gradually removed, the caisson also gradually lowers due to the increase in air pressure, until it reaches the wooden piles or stone layers at the bottom of the river. At the same time, the pier column built on the caisson is also gradually built up, making it rise above the water surface. The steel beams of the bridge are then erected on it.</p>
<p>At present, the construction of the first pier in the north is more than half completed. The air pressure initially used in the caisson was only 17 to 18 pounds (4 pounds higher than atmospheric pressure), and 2 English cubic yards of sand and soil could be excavated per day. The caisson sank about 2 to 3 inches. Now the air pressure has been increased to more than 30 pounds, and the amount of sand and soil excavated per day has increased more than five times compared to before. The caisson sank about 6 to 7 inches. On the pier column standing above the water surface, it is marked that it has entered the water for more than 40 feet. Before the first pier is completed, the work on the second pier has already begun.</p>
<p>When the Qiantang River Bridge is completed, a large park will be established along the Qiantang River at the north end of the bridge. This double-layer iron bridge will span across it. The Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway train will wind its way from Nanxing Bridge across the Qiantang River to the Huangtushan on the north bank, roaring down across the river, and disappearing into the wilderness of Xiaoshan County on the opposite bank. Southbound cars will also drive across the upper layer of this bridge and enter the avenue built on the mountainside along the river, reaching Hangzhou to the north, Zhakou to the east, and Fuyang and other places to the west under the towering Liuhe Pagoda in the forest. If we can come here in the morning and evening, wandering and overlooking on the upper layer of the bridge, we can see the river winding from the west, flowing east under the bridge into the vast clouds and water. Along the river on the north bank, the peaks and mountains are verdant and blue, the highways are crisscrossing, and cars are speeding halfway up the mountain. The Liuhe Pagoda is towering and overlooking in the sunshine, and the scenery is also enough to make people feel happy.</p>

<p>Establishing a Price Assessment Committee and Setting Minimum Standards for Copper Coins</p>
<p>Anqing Correspondence: The financial situation in Anhui has always been extremely depleted. The only things that can be used for circulation are silver coins and copper coins. Most commodity prices are based on copper coins. Each silver coin could be exchanged for 360 to 370 copper coins, depending on the price. Recently, since the Ministry of Finance implemented its currency policy, unscrupulous merchants and market vendors have taken the opportunity to hoard and manipulate prices, and transport large quantities of copper coins out of the province, resulting in a daily decrease in the number of copper coins in the market. Each silver coin is only worth about 300 copper coins, and there is an upward trend, while various daily necessities are gradually becoming more expensive, which has a huge impact on the livelihood of the common people. Therefore, the provincial government specially convened the heads of the Civil Affairs, Finance, and Construction Bureaus, as well as the Anqing Public Security Bureau, the Huaining County Government, and the Huaining County Chamber of Commerce, at 4:00 PM on the 12th in the Civil Affairs Bureau to discuss measures to crack down on and provide relief. The following key points were resolved: (1) Establish a Price Assessment Committee in Anqing City. The detailed rules will be drafted by the Construction Bureau and submitted to the meeting for review. (2) The price of copper coins will be set at 320 coins per yuan of national currency. The Anqing Public Security Bureau will pay close attention to the outflow of copper coins and will not allow hoarding or manipulation. (3) Investigate the comparison of various daily commodity prices after the implementation of the legal tender with those before the implementation. This investigation will be carried out by the provincial government ordering the Huaining County Government and the Anqing Public Security Bureau to cooperate with the Huaining County Chamber of Commerce, and the results of the investigation will be reported in a list. On the 14th, the Huaining County Government and the Anqing Public Security Bureau have followed the orders of the provincial government and jointly issued a notice, strictly prohibiting the private transportation of copper coins out of the province, and clearly stipulating the standard market price of copper coins, with a minimum exchange rate of 320 copper coins per silver dollar, in order to gradually stabilize the financial situation in the market.

<p>Already Dismantled 300,000 Legal Tender Dollars,</p>
<p>Market Still Stagnant and Turnover Remains Difficult</p>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Since Jiangxi Province officially implemented the use of legal tender, the market has remained relatively stable. Due to the economic stagnation and financial exhaustion in recent years, all industries have been in extreme decline. Therefore, the impact has been minimal. Taking the Qian industry as an example, in the past two years, due to active business and frequent transactions, they made profits without losses. Now, they are in a precarious state and require banks to maintain them. The reasons are: (1) There are more than 70 Qian shops in the city. Except for a few, such as Yichangren, the capital of each shop is only between 10,000 and 50,000 yuan. However, it is not enough to do a 200,000 yuan business to cover expenses. The support of the business relies entirely on absorbing ordinary deposits and daily retail and wholesale goods payments from various industries. At this time of total social and economic collapse, there are very few funds available for deposit, and various industries also have no cash to store due to sluggish business. (2) Bankruptcies have occurred repeatedly in the city this year, and all sectors are wary of depositing and lending funds. It is difficult for the Qian industry to both deposit and lend, losing its circulation function. (3) Since the bandit disasters in the province, transactions with other counties and the turnover of import and export businesses have been extremely poor. (4) The dismantling interest rate is too high, consistently above 50%, easily resulting in bad debts. (5) Exchange and larger businesses have been completely taken over by banks. Due to these reasons, the Qian industry has been declining daily. After the implementation of legal tender, depositors rushed to withdraw their deposits, and the loans released to various industries could not be recovered. (Businesses with weak foundations cannot repay the loans, while those with solid foundations hope for inventory price increases). The Qian industry is caught in this double squeeze. On the 5th and 6th of this month, they dared not open for business. On the 7th, after Finance Director Wu discussed with the Provincial Yumin Bank, as well as the Central, China, and Transportation Banks, 300,000 legal tender dollars were dismantled and given to the members of the Qian Industry Association, which broke the deadlock. However, this 300,000 yuan is like a drop in the bucket. Each Qian shop can only handle retail and small withdrawals. It is not easy to withdraw amounts over 1,000 yuan. As for lending, it has already been stopped. The Qian Industry Association and the Exchange Association have been requesting Finance Director Wu for days to have the banking sector dismantle as much legal tender as possible to maintain the industry and facilitate turnover. The Finance Office believes that the Qian industry is the hub of all industries and is anxiously considering how to get through the New Year and next year's opening period. However, with the difficulty of turnover in various industries, there are likely to be many businesses closing down for the New Year. (November 12th)</p>
<h3 id="e69">Soaring Prices in Jiaodong <a href="#e69" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c69" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">69</a></h3>
<p>—Certain Foreigners Secretly Buying Up Silver Dollars—</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Since the central government implemented the new currency system policy, the general merchants and people do not understand the situation, resulting in widespread rumors and soaring prices, which greatly affects the people's livelihood. Even the prices of copper coins in various places have risen sharply. In Qingdao, 540 copper coins were previously exchanged for one silver dollar, but now only 380 copper coins are needed to exchange for one silver dollar. The municipal government, in order to stabilize the market and people's hearts, and to maintain local order, (1) posted notices stipulating that 500 copper coins should be exchanged for one legal tender dollar, and (2) tried to stabilize prices and prevent deliberate price increases. People's hearts gradually stabilized. However, in the Jiaodong area, such as Zhucheng, Anqiu, Gaomi, Jiaoxian, Jimo, and Yexian counties, prices are still soaring. These counties are close to Qingdao, and the prices of various goods in Qingdao are inevitably affected. In the Jiaodong counties, each dou of wheat used to be worth 3.4 yuan, but now it has risen to over 4 yuan. Each dou of beans used to be worth 3.2 yuan, but now it has risen to around 4 yuan. Each piece of cotton yarn used to be worth 160 yuan, but now it has risen to 176 yuan. Other grains and daily necessities are also soaring in price, causing panic among the people. It is also heard that certain foreigners have secretly sent people to various counties in Jiaodong to buy up silver dollars at high prices. Initially, they used 1.3 legal tender dollars to buy one silver dollar, but now they are using 1.5 legal tender dollars to buy one silver dollar. Therefore, merchants and people who have silver dollars are regarding them as rare commodities, and many unscrupulous merchants are happy to buy them for the foreigners, hoping to profit from it. This is also one of the reasons for the soaring prices.</p>

<p>Zhang Yingze, Ke Jun, Huang Zhongfu, Gong Jinyun, Yang Lisheng, Fei Yongxing, and other six political and police officers of the county government were reported in December of the 23rd year for smoking opium. The county government sent the police officers to the county opium detoxification center for investigation, and the results showed that they had no opium addiction. It is now learned that the county government suddenly received an order from the Department of Civil Affairs, instructing them to send the police officers to the province for re-examination, and also ordered that the director of the county opium detoxification center, Sun Youxin, be given a demerit, and the doctor Dong Zhaoteng be dismissed. Except for Huang Zhongfu and others, who fled upon hearing the news, the county sent Zhang Yingze and Ke Jun, who were detained, to the province on the 15th under police escort.</p>

<p>The chambers of commerce in various counties are facing the abolition of the merchant corps as ordered by the government, which coincides with the serious period of winter defense. Therefore, the chambers of commerce and merchant corps in various counties have selected representatives to hold a joint meeting at the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce at 3 pm on the 17th to discuss the issue of retention or abolition. More than 20 representatives from more than 10 counties attended the meeting. Mr. Lu Xiaobo was elected as the temporary chairman. The chairman reported that the Zhenjiang Merchant Corps had many obligations and few employees. As for the necessity of the existence of the merchant corps, taking Zhenjiang as an example, the military and police are densely deployed, which is sufficient to maintain local security. Therefore, there is no real need for its existence. I don't know what the situation is in other counties. In my personal opinion, it seems more convenient for the county government to preside over it, with merchants participating. What should be done, please discuss together. After discussion and consultation by the representatives, it was unanimously decided to first ask Chairman Lu Xiaobo to contact Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government and Director Yu of the Department of Civil Affairs. Then, taking advantage of the Jiangsu Provincial Chamber of Commerce's meeting in the provincial capital on the 21st of this month, invite the Director of the Department of Civil Affairs and the Director of the Provincial Security Office to conduct joint research at the Zhenjiang Provincial Chamber of Commerce to decide on everything. The meeting then adjourned, when the lights of ten thousand homes were already on. That night, the Wuxian County Chamber of Commerce, the Fire Fighting Federation, and the Merchant Corps Headquarters hosted a banquet for the representatives of various counties at the Yanqing Restaurant outside the Panmen Gate.</p>

<h3 id="e83">The Meaning and Function of Science <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>—Gan Xiangrong, Instructor, Central Military Academy</p>
<p>(I) What is science? The term science is the English word "Science" or the German word "Wissenschaft". If interpreted broadly, science should include the spiritual sciences (i.e., sociology, history, law, and economics, etc.) and the natural sciences. However, the science generally referred to by people is interpreted narrowly, and its content is limited to the natural sciences.</p>
<p>Natural science takes natural objects and natural phenomena as its research objects. Physiology, geology, astronomy, and physical chemistry are all natural sciences. As for mathematics, although it has a close relationship with natural science, mathematics does not belong to natural science in strict scientific classification.</p>
<p>In the 18th century, the French mathematical philosopher d'Alembert classified mathematics into the natural sciences when he edited the encyclopedia. However, later scholars such as Wundt separated mathematics from the natural sciences.</p>
<p>Mathematics is an abstract formal science, while natural science is an experiential material science. Their essences are mutually opposed and cannot belong to each other. Natural science studies objective experiential content, while mathematics is not bound by experience. For example, imaginary numbers or complex numbers are of little use in the calculation of experiential ordinary things, and four-dimensional or five-dimensional space is definitely not our experiential space.</p>
<p>The study of natural science, especially physics, must rely on mathematics. Einstein's theory of relativity succeeded with the advancement of higher numbers, but the basis of the theory of relativity lies in experiential reality and is definitely not entirely based on mathematical deduction. In other studies such as astronomy and theoretical chemistry, mathematics is an indispensable research method, but the essence of the knowledge is completely independent of mathematics. In short, natural science is an objective experiential science, while mathematics is transcendent and irrelevant to experience. The two should not be mixed together.</p>
<p>(II) The essence of science: Humans have two desires for nature: one is the hope to explore the mystery of nature; the other is the hope to use nature for daily life. In order to satisfy these two desires, they study natural objects and various natural phenomena from all aspects. In this way, they gradually accumulate fragments of knowledge and organize and verify them, and then gradually discover universal causal relationships, which can lead to the establishment of science. There is a very important principle in the path of establishing science. This principle is: to seek to explain facts by confirming facts. If our predetermined theory is contrary to the facts, then this theory that does not conform to the facts should be overthrown.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned thought of respecting facts originated in the era of Greek philosophy, and its maturity was only realized until the period of modern scientific development. How can we confirm the facts? The main methods are observation and experiment. Observation refers to the artificial attention to natural phenomena to obtain correct experience. Experiment refers to the use of artificial methods to transform complex natural phenomena into simpler ones, and then analyze them to determine the truth of the facts. All researchers of science know the importance of observation and experiment. Without precise observation and experimental methods, natural science will never progress. In other words, the methods of observation and experiment are gradually improved, and their precision is gradually increased. Thus, science can develop. Therefore, if we want to understand the essence or characteristics of science, we should first mention observation and experiment.</p>
<p>Still others want to understand the essence of science by examining it from its method. Let me briefly describe it. The methods of science can be divided into (1) description and classification, (2) induction of special cases into general necessary laws, and (3) recognition of purposefulness in biological phenomena. Description and classification are methods commonly used in zoology, botany, mineralogy, and many places in chemistry. Combining similar natural objects under one class concept is called "classification." Analyzing the characteristics of each class and expressing them is called "description." Description and classification must explore the essential properties of the object as the basis for classification, and the means of exploration rely on observation and experiment. Therefore, without precise observation and experiment, description or classification cannot be accurate. Establishing laws is the ultimate goal of natural science. The so-called "law" must have universality and necessity that transcend time and space. For example, Newton's law of universal gravitation in physics and Mendeleev's periodic law in chemistry are both universal necessary laws. Their establishment is based on the induction of various special experiences and verification. However, their basis is still the result of observation and experiment. Later, new facts are obtained from advanced observation and experiment, and then laws such as universal gravitation and the periodic law must be revised. As for biological phenomena, they cannot be explained purely by causal laws. Therefore, for the overall study of biology, we cannot discuss mechanical causal relationships in the same way as physics and chemistry. Biological phenomena must be viewed from the perspective of purpose and means, in addition to causal relationships. Even in Darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of "natural selection" or "survival of the fittest" do not only refer to causal relationships but also contain some teleological components. However, in any case, the study of biological phenomena is definitely not based on empty imagination. Its basis must also be in accurate observation and experiment.</p>
<p>In short, natural science originates from human's desire for knowledge and utilization, and the development and progress of natural science depend entirely on the accuracy of observation and experimental methods. In order to understand the essence of science, we should of course understand this principle.</p>
<p>(III) The influence of science on modern thought: Science has a profound influence on the thinking of modern people. Therefore, science has a close relationship with various schools of thought in modern times. Here, we will only examine the influence of science on the world of thought from the two aspects of idealism and materialism.</p>
<p>Idealism takes the soul as the highest argument. The most primitive and most dominant idealism of mankind is religion. In the early days of science, religion exercised its authority in faith and often oppressed science. The Roman Emperor of Christianity in Europe regarded the heliocentric theory as heresy and severely punished and interfered with it. Galileo claimed that the heliocentric theory was correct based on the observation of stars, but his book was banned, and he was ordered to swear that his statement was wrong. In the 19th century, Darwin's theory of biological evolution was also opposed by religious scholars. However, science has objective truth, and no oppression can damage it in the slightest. Therefore, the rise of science has forced religious theories to be reformed. On the one hand, there should also be reflective investigations on science itself. Science takes objective experience as its object, but what is experience? Our understanding of natural objects and natural phenomena all depends on the senses of our five senses (sight, smell, taste, hearing, touch). Then what is sensation? These questions raise reflective doubts about the "object" itself and the truth of science. Therefore, science does not destroy idealism, but adopts a critical attitude of improvement towards idealism. Pearson once said: Scientific knowledge is a synthesis of the reality of sensation plus the organization of thinking. Then it can be known that the truth of science is a natural model formed by our thinking. Nature is complete and whole, and the various divisions of natural science are just cross-sections of various aspects of the above-mentioned natural model.</p>
<p>Materialism takes matter as the only basis for discussion. The prosperity of natural science caused the industrial revolution, which transformed society from an agricultural society to an industrial society, and transformed life from rural life to concentrated urban life, which made modern people fascinated by materialistic thoughts. The foundation of science lies in discovering universal necessary causal laws. There is no so-called will or spiritual effect for all natural phenomena. In the eyes of scientists, they only recognize that matter undergoes various changes under the control of natural laws. Therefore, materialistic thought is indeed very close to natural science, but materialism also regards "spirit" as a "reality" of matter. Its proposition is a metaphysical theory, which is different from experiential natural science. For example, future biology may be able to explore the relationship between biological and spiritual effects and seek the necessary laws between them, but the purpose of natural science is only to clarify the facts, and it will never subordinate spiritual effects to matter. This is just like physics studying the relationship between matter and energy. Its purpose is only to understand the facts related to the various states of matter and energy, and it does not consider subordinating "energy" to matter. At the same time, we should pay attention to the fact that natural science's research on matter certainly focuses on the observation and experiment of matter itself, but also pays attention to the correctness of thinking and the completeness of argumentation. Anyone who studies science probably knows that before a certain observation and experiment, there must first be some premonitions. Although this premonition is not necessarily correct, premonition has a significant relationship with whether the research can succeed. In short, although science absolutely emphasizes matter, it is absolutely not metaphysical materialism.</p>
<p>From the above, it can be seen that science has given a very deep influence to simple idealism and metaphysical mechanical materialism, forcing them to change separately. The critical philosophy and intuitive philosophy in the modern philosophical world, as well as various thoughts on vitalism, have all emerged under the baptism of science.</p>
<p>(IV) The contribution of science to life: In our daily life, no matter what we eat, wear, live, or travel, we rely on scientific inventions. Therefore, the function of science is very broad, and the contribution of science to life is very great.</p>
<p>The invention of rayon synthetic dyes and the progress of textile machines have greatly reformed our clothing. The fixation of air and the large supply of artificial fertilizers have changed agriculture, and our food is also affected by advanced science. The development of cement and steel industries has changed the style of the construction industry in the past. The progress of internal combustion engines and light metals has added automobiles and airplanes to the transportation industry from trains. In this way, the problems of living and traveling are also very different from before.</p>
<p>The function of science is so broad that it cannot be listed one by one, but there is a fundamental problem that must be paid attention to: that is, there must first be theoretical development in science, and then various applications can be invented, and the contribution of science to us lies only in how to adapt to nature, and we can never use science to conquer nature. Let's extend this discussion.</p>
<p>Science either discovers things that we cannot usually feel, or invents causal relationships that are usually neglected. Its ultimate purpose is to clarify the truth of natural phenomena, and it does not ask whether the phenomenon is useful. However, in the course of studying the truth, useful things are often discovered. This discovery is an accidental and incidental discovery. In other words, science is definitely not studied for application, but accidentally encounters application problems in the course of research. For example, in the course of broadly studying the theory of electromagnetic waves, special X-rays were accidentally discovered. At that time, no attention was paid to its use. Later, it was gradually learned that X-rays had a significant relationship with human physiology. Therefore, it is becoming more and more developed, and now it has become a specialty in medical technology. For example, Professor Ostwald was the first scholar to create theoretical chemistry. He discovered that oxygen can be oxidized to form nitric acid when studying the contact effect. At that time, nitric acid was cheaper than oxygen. This invention was completely useless, but it was very valuable in theory. Who knew that later Haber invented that aerial nitrogen can be used to synthesize oxygen. Therefore, the discovery of Professor Ostwald was used to indirectly manufacture nitric acid from aerial nitrogen. Its use was greatly clarified, so that Germany, which was blockaded in the European War, did not worry about the lack of raw materials for gunpowder production. Try to find out the various scientific problems that are currently applied and examine their origins, and those similar to the above examples are almost innumerable. It can be seen that all applied sciences are produced after the theory.</p>
<p>People in the primitive era were often threatened by natural disasters, so they often held terrifying concepts about nature. Until modern times, mankind used science in daily life to obtain natural benefits, as if nature could be freely driven by us, and said that civilization is the result of science conquering nature. This view is really wrong, and we must examine it. Using nature is definitely not conquering nature, because natural phenomena have certain necessary laws. All the facts that arise in nature are in accordance with these laws. How can human beings interfere with nature or conquer nature? We can only study the laws of natural phenomena, thus understand their causal relationships, and be able to predict the phenomena that should arise. For example, meteorology is very precise because of the observation of temperature and air pressure in various places, so we can know in advance that there should be strong winds and rain in a certain place at a certain time, but no matter how advanced meteorology is, it can never interfere with nature and never prevent the occurrence of strong winds and rain. Also, we make machines to use nature. The principle is only to change the contact and configuration of objects, so as to make them suitable for the realization of a certain natural law. For example, all power machines turn heat energy into work under natural laws. People can never make the machine work without fuel. The function of science can only try to save fuel as much as possible, so that the potential energy contained in it can be turned into work as much as possible. As mentioned above, it can be seen that it is not human beings who conquer nature. Human beings only adapt to nature with the development of science. (End)</p>

<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and others received a telegram from the Ministry of Finance stating, "To the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Municipal Bankers Association, Municipal Money Changers Association, Inspector General of Customs, Superintendent of Jianghai Customs, Central Mint, Bureau of Unified Taxes for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, Jiangsu Tobacco and Alcohol Stamp Tax Bureau, Songjiang Transport Deputy, Exchange Supervision Committee, National Federation of Chambers of Commerce, and General Inspectorate of Salt Affairs: Having examined, for the purpose of standardizing the methods for exchanging legal tender and facilitating implementation, this Ministry has detailed eight articles of exchange methods, promulgated for implementation, and (requested for reference by telegram) (ordered for compliance by telegram) to be followed in accordance with the record. Now, upon examination of Article 1, Section 1 of the aforementioned methods, it is stipulated that 'silver for industrial arts or other necessary product raw materials, as permitted by the government according to the regulations on the management of silver usage in silver products,' etc. These regulations on the management of silver usage in silver products have also been formulated by the Ministry, totaling twelve articles (as seen in previous reports in this newspaper), in addition to promulgation and submission to the Executive Yuan and distribution by telegram. This telegram is to instruct compliance and further instruct subordinate organizations to comply accordingly." The Ministry of Finance has deleted. Since receiving the telegram, the Chamber of Commerce and other organizations have separately ordered subordinate organizations to comply.</p>
<p>Silverware Guild Petitions for Amendments</p>
<p>Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the regulations on the management of silver usage in silver products, the Silverware Guild held an extraordinary general meeting at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday. Attendees included Qingfuxing, Lao Fengxiang, Yang Qinghe, Qiu Tianbao, Qingyun, etc., chaired by Fu Shengmao. He reported that Article 2 of the Ministry's regulations stipulates, "From the date of announcement of these regulations, all silver utensils and silver ornaments manufactured shall, in principle, be made of chemical silver. If pure silver must be mixed, the amount of pure silver contained shall not exceed thirty percent." However, the guild's regulations stipulate that the content of pure silver is eighty-eight percent. He specifically put it to a vote, and the assembly believed that containing no more than thirty percent pure silver would be impossible for the silverware industry to implement. This is because (1) silverware and other items in the silverware industry are all handmade, and reducing pure silver will make them too hard to manufacture; (2) reducing pure silver will make the quality not easily white and shiny, inevitably making it impossible to operate the business. A resolution was made on the spot to jointly petition with the national industry to the Ministry, requesting amendments to the management regulations. The meeting adjourned around 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Cotton Yarn Exports Gradually Become Smooth: The Future of the Yarn Industry Shows a Glimmer of Optimism <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, cotton yarn factories in the city have suspended or reduced the number of operating machines by more than half this year due to expensive cotton and cheap yarn. According to information obtained by a reporter from the Huadong News Agency, since the Ministry of Finance reformed the currency system, the import prices of Indian and American cotton have become more expensive than before due to stable exchange rates. Domestic cotton, since the Cotton Industry Control Committee has vigorously promoted reforms, has improved compared to previous years, and prices have gradually become uniform. At the same time, packaging and transportation have improved since the five banks, including the Bank of Communications, Jin Cheng Bank, Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, and China Agricultural Bank, organized the China Agricultural Loan Group this spring, and the cooperation between production and sales has gradually improved, showing gradual results. Therefore, the goods from Lingbao, Shaanxi, are almost comparable to Indian and American cotton, and many foreign merchants purchase and transport them abroad. Japanese merchants are even more enthusiastic. More than 2,000 bales have been shipped out since the beginning of this month. The yarn produced by domestic cotton yarn factories has also been improved again and again, and various ports in Nanyang are happy to purchase it. Therefore, the future of the yarn industry shows a glimmer of optimism. If the government uses its power to provide rediscounting from the Central Bank, reducing the interest rate on debts by about four percent, then the factories that have stopped production can immediately hope to resume work.</p>
<h3 id="e86">Rice Prices in Shanghai Decline Weakly: Top-Grade Rice Reaches a Maximum Price of Eleven Yuan and Seventy-Eight Cents <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, a month ago, various places were harvesting late rice, and the busy farming season began. Although the rice in the fields had been harvested, it had not yet been milled. Therefore, river rice arrived sparsely, with only six or seven thousand piculs per day. Recently, the busy farming season has passed, and milled rice has been sold in large quantities. Therefore, rice boats from Changshu, Wuxi, Wuxian, Kunshan, Fengjing, Songjiang, Tongli, Zhangyan, and other areas have transported rice to the city, reaching more than 20,000 packages per day.</p>
<p>Rumors Affect Price Decline: Since unfounded rumors occurred in Shanghai, people have been panicked. Retail stores, because rice is a bulky commodity, except for having to slightly replenish their stocks to meet the needs of customers, are mostly unwilling to purchase and hoard in large quantities, especially in the Hongkou, Zhabei, Jiangwan, and Wusong areas. Although Tianjin, Yantai, and Shantou have sold some goods, the quantity is not large, resulting in the accumulation of river rice, and market prices have been affected and declined weakly. Top-grade rice is priced at eleven yuan and seventy-eight cents, second-grade at eleven yuan and twelve cents, third-grade at ten yuan and forty-five cents, and thin rice at nine yuan and seventy-eight cents. There is still no hope for higher prices at present.</p>
<p>Autumn Harvest Conditions in Various Places: The famous rice-producing areas in our country are Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, and others. This year, floods have affected all provinces. According to the results of the survey, the autumn harvest conditions are roughly as follows: the harvest in Jiangsu and Zhejiang is about 70%, and the harvest in Hunan, Hubei, and Jiangxi is about 80%. However, Anhui Province has the best harvest year, with a 100% harvest.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Silk Factories Lack Raw Materials and Suspend Production: Eagerly Awaiting the Promotion of Sericulture <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>Issue More Silkworm Eggs and Cultivate Mulberry Forests: The Silk Industry Should Also Improve Technology</p>
<p>According to a Dagong News Agency report, silk factories in the city have recently been short of raw materials and unable to reel silk. Therefore, as many as sixteen factories have successively suspended production since last month. By the end of this month, it is feared that all factories will suspend production. A reporter met with a prominent figure in the silk industry yesterday, who stated that the export of silk from our country has always occupied an important position. In recent years, due to the global economic downturn and the dumping of Japanese silk at depreciated prices, Chinese silk has suffered a setback, and prices have plummeted. Farmers in the Jiangsu and Zhejiang areas have changed to other industries because there is no profit to be made. Since the summer of this year, the Japanese silkworm-producing areas have suffered floods, and production has decreased, while demand in Europe and the United States has increased. Therefore, sales have been active, and silk prices have risen, which is a major turning point for the export of Chinese silk. Most of the suspended silk factories have resumed production one after another to meet export needs. Unfortunately, because silkworm farmers raise very few silkworms, and production is not abundant, all factories feel a lack of raw materials, which is not enough to meet the reeling needs, and they have successively stopped production in recent days, which is truly heartbreaking. Therefore, the silk industry hopes that the Construction Department of Jiangsu and Zhejiang should pay attention to (1) issuing more silkworm eggs. This year, only more than 1.8 million improved seeds were issued, and at least 6 million must be issued next year to match production and sales; (2) cultivating mulberry forests. In recent years, silkworm farmers have regarded sericulture as a daunting task because they have seen silk prices plummet. They not only do not cultivate the mulberry trees they have planted but also cut them down in large quantities. As a result, silkworm food is insufficient, causing panic. At the same time, the silk industry itself should also improve technology, such as reeling machines, silk management, and shipping, which all need to be paid close attention to so that exports can be prosperous, which can be hoped for.</p>

<p>According to the Shiye News Agency, the members of the Shanghai Money Industry Association will soon clear the 2 million yuan owed to commercial banks in the financial public debt. They are also actively trying to repay the 18 million yuan issued by the Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. Members of the Money Vault Inspection Committee began inspection yesterday. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Repaying Public Debt: In April this spring, the Ministry of Finance allocated 25 million yuan in financial public debt to appease the financial turmoil in Shanghai and provide relief to the money industry. In addition to the 3 million yuan already repaid by the Money Industry Joint Reserve, and the 4 million yuan cleared to commercial banks, efforts are also being made to repay the debts owed to the Central, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications. It is learned that the 2 million yuan still owed to commercial banks by various banks can be cleared in the near future. The 18 million yuan owed to the three banks has been handled by the relevant banks with the Money Industry Supervision Committee to arrange for repayment in installments.</p>
<p>Inspecting Money Vaults: According to regulations, the Money Industry Reserve Inspection Committee should elect three people with a term of one year. The new members have been elected by the members' meeting: Qian Yuansheng, Yu Zuoting, and Wang Huailian. Wu Zilin and Qin Zhenfu are alternates. To cultivate the foundation of the money industry, the members must first consolidate the strength of the reserve. In order to promote the plan and allow the various banks to understand the situation, they began work yesterday, including (1) counting the assets of the reserve and (2) inspecting all account books and documents of the reserve. A systematic report will be made to the members next month.</p>

<p>According to the Continental News, Keenahan, the US Consul General in Shanghai, received a message from Washington yesterday (16th) and stated that he will leave Shanghai and return home on December 21. The news that Keenahan would retire came out in June of this year, and it will become a reality at the end of the year. However, Keenahan will stop working at the end of this month. He will spend his time in Shanghai in the third week of December on leave, and prepare everything. It is said that Mr. Davis of the US Consulate General will temporarily act as Consul General until Keenahan's successor is appointed. Shanghai has not yet received news of who Keenahan's successor will be. Davis's term of office will last until the end of the year. The new Consul General should be able to take office before the end of the year. It is rumored that Davis has a good chance of succeeding Keenahan. Keenahan has served in the consulate for 37 years. He has served as Consul General in Shanghai since 1919. The United States established a consulate in Shanghai 90 years ago. The previous 32 people who held Keenahan's position could not match Keenahan's term. Keenahan is two years past the age of retirement. Now that he is about to retire, the leader of the Shanghai consuls will also be replaced. During his 37 years of service, Keenahan has served in various parts of the world. From 1898 to 1901, he served as Consul in Aden. For the next five years, he served in Norway. From 1905 to 1910, he served in South Africa. Since 1910, he has been transferred to the East, serving as Consul in Mumbai, Singapore, and Hankou. Later, he was promoted to Consul General in Shanghai, which has been 16 years now.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, the fundraising group of the Municipal Provincial Flood Relief Association, in order to speak for the victims and increase fundraising income, specifically discussed with the Municipal Scouting Council to hold a city-wide scout mobilization for fundraising, divided into external and internal activities. Thanks to the efforts of scouts from various groups and the enthusiastic support of all sectors of society, the results have been very excellent. It is learned that the fundraising work was completed yesterday in accordance with the regulations. It is currently being rushed to completion. According to a reporter's interview with the Scouting Council, 47 groups have successively paid more than 10,000 yuan in foreign currency. Other groups may pay by 4:00 PM today. It is expected that the results of this fundraising will be very impressive. Once the detailed numbers are reconciled, they will be announced. It is also heard that the Scouting Council believes that the scouts from various groups have worked very hard in fundraising. It is planned to present awards separately to those with relatively good results in accordance with the previous agreement to encourage them.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Issuance of Public Works Bonds: Distributed by the National Economic Council: Public Works Are Also Hosted and Conducted by the National Economic Council <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the National Government issued the 24th Year of the Republic of China Flood Relief Public Works Bonds, with a fixed amount of 20 million yuan, to provide relief to the flood-stricken provinces. The regulations have been reviewed and passed by the 36th meeting of the Legislative Yuan and issued on November 1st. However, because the actual issuance procedures have not been prepared, the Ministry of Finance has printed subscription certificates first, so that formal denominations can be exchanged at the time of issuance. The public bonds are divided into three types: 10 yuan, 100 yuan, and 1,000 yuan. They are all bearer bonds with an annual interest rate of 6%, issued at 98% of the face value. According to news from the Shanghai Fundraising Association for Provincial Flood Relief, the issuance of these public bonds is under the charge of the Ministry of Finance. Emergency relief in the disaster areas of the Yangtze River and Yellow River basins has been completed, and public works are urgently needed to be carried out. This time, the central government followed the precedent of providing 20 million yuan in aid to the people, and the total amount of flood relief public works bonds issued is 20 million yuan, which is enough to be distributed according to the disaster situation. In addition to the issuance matters being reviewed and handled by the Ministry of Finance, the distribution of the amount in each province is the responsibility of the National Economic Council. All dike construction and various defense construction projects in various provinces in the Yangtze and Yellow River basins, after being inspected by the National Economic Council, are being supervised by personnel dispatched by the council. Therefore, there is no fundamental problem in the issuance of these public bonds after the council has prepared and decided on the detailed distribution rules. Each province can verify and receive the bonds, mortgage them to the banking industry, and the council will still host the public works matters.</p>

<p>A Total of More Than 14 Million in Six Months: A Decrease of More Than 8 Million Compared to the Same Period Last Year</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, leather is a special product of the northwest of our country, and the number of exports is quite large. In recent years, due to the fact that livestock breeders have adhered to the old methods and have not improved them, they have gradually declined. According to the International Trade Bureau, the total export value in the past six months of this year was more than 14.494 million yuan, a decrease of more than 8.4 million yuan compared to the same period last year. Among them, except for an increase of more than 728,000 yuan in leather blankets and rugs, other goods, such as raw buffalo hides, decreased by more than 250,000 yuan, raw cattle hides decreased by 47%, and un tanned lambskins decreased by 43%. In terms of leather sales, Hong Kong and Germany are the largest markets for raw buffalo hides, and France is the lowest. Japan is the largest market for raw cattle hides, accounting for more than 776,000 yuan, and the United States is the smallest. The United States is the largest market for dog skins and un tanned skins, accounting for more than 3.4 million yuan. Lambskins, yellow wolf skins, and leather blankets and rugs are also mainly sold to the United States, accounting for more than 6.74 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e101">South District Rent Reduction Committee Sends Representatives to Petition the Fifth Plenary Session <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Nanshi District Rent Reduction Committee recently dispatched Shen Xinfu and others to submit a petition to the Fifth National Congress to reduce rents. The City-Wide Rent Reduction Representatives Conference resolved that, pending the promulgation of explicit rent reduction measures, in order to alleviate the city's conditions and maintain the status quo, rent for new buildings would be paid at 60% of the original rate, and rent for old buildings would revert to the original rate six years prior. If any rent reduction leads to dismissal by landlords, or if rent arrears are pursued, reports should be made immediately to the legal team of the South District Rent Reduction Committee at No. 9 Mu Di, Luxiangyuan Road, Zhian Lane. The committee will provide legal assistance. Since the beginning of this year, Shanghai courts have issued many judgments regarding lease cases, deciding on rent reductions of 70%, 80%, 90%, etc. Merchants who wish to reduce rent but are unclear about the details may directly inquire with the committee. The original text of the committee's submission to the Fifth National Congress is recorded below, petitioning for high rents in Shanghai to be reduced and requesting that the matter be submitted to the congress for deliberation and resolution, and that the National Government be requested by letter to order the Shanghai Municipal Government, local courts, and all relevant agencies to assist the affiliated associations in strictly implementing rent reduction to save people's lives, for the following reasons: It is estimated that Shanghai has a population of 3.5 million. Excluding landowners, property owners, and foreigners, numbering approximately 500,000, the remaining 3 million people must rent houses to live in. The annual rent paid, on average, accounts for approximately two-thirds of their total annual income. In the past, when the market was prosperous and commerce flourished, they could barely manage to support themselves, but now, in the midst of the global economic panic and the surging tide of domestic rural bankruptcy, Shanghai is inevitably affected. If this situation continues, not only will commerce have no way to flourish and the market will be difficult to prosper, but this huge population will also starve to death and have no way to survive. This is the first reason why rent reduction should be strictly implemented. Since the January 28th Incident, Shanghai's vitality has been severely damaged and has not yet recovered, leading to an increasing number of unemployed people and starving beggars lining the streets. People have no time to save themselves from death, let alone any purchasing power. This is why goods are piling up, sales are difficult, and financial stagnation is a concern. Various tragic phenomena are unfolding before our eyes. The reasons for this are indeed complex, but the biggest one is that rents are too high. The blood and sweat of most citizens, in addition to a large portion being used to pay rent, is insufficient to provide them with adequate food and clothing. This is the second reason why rent reduction should be strictly implemented. Since its establishment in January of last year, the committee has been actively working day and night. Now in Shanghai, under the organization of the affiliated associations, the establishment of branch associations in various streets and lanes has spread the call for rent reduction throughout the city. The impact has been such that those moved to reduce rents, such as in the Minquan Road area, have reached two-thirds. However, some are stubbornly resistant, arbitrarily preventing business operations, or listening to slander and filing lawsuits, so that seeking peace is instead met with unrest, and the burden of lawsuits increases before rent is reduced. The presiding judges, in order to consider the overall situation of the city, are unwilling to push either side to extremes and repeatedly try to mediate. The affiliated associations, caught in the middle of this insistence from both sides, are running around appealing and gently mediating, becoming hoarse and exhausted. They have submitted petitions to party and government organs several times, but this matter is of great importance, and without the force of political power, it is not enough to serve as a warning. This is why we should request that the matter be submitted to the congress for deliberation and resolution, and that the administrative organs be requested by letter to provide assistance. Third reason. Measures: (1) The congress should conduct a detailed discussion, deliberate and resolve the matter, and request the National Government by letter to order the Shanghai Municipal Government, local courts, and all relevant agencies to provide assistance in various ways, so that this rent reduction movement can be deepened and universalized, in order to achieve complete success. (2) Based on the Shanghai land price standards promulgated this year by the Shanghai Land Bureau, calculate the land price, and then add the construction cost, which will be the cost of the house. In accordance with this cost, set the rent rate, which should not exceed the statutory amount, excluding the landlord's land tax and house donation (originally one cent, now too high, to be regulated separately by the court). For those with unclear construction dates, an estimate must also be made, ensuring fairness and impartiality, so that both landlord and tenant are at peace. Rent reduction movement meets the needs of the times, and on behalf of the people, it calls out. We hope that all the party and state leaders will be concerned about the people's suffering and pay attention to it, and that they will carefully deliberate and resolve the matter in the congress discussing national affairs, and implement it vigorously. Then Shanghai will be fortunate, and China will be fortunate. The matter concerns people's lives and is a matter of urgency.</p>

<h3 id="e104">Staff of the Vagrant Vocational Training Center Assist in Disaster Relief <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>This year's floods have caused havoc across the country, with tens of millions of compatriots completely reduced to a human hell where they cannot seek death nor survive. Anyone with a heart must feel compassion and grief, and all of us who have not been affected by the disaster should unite to save food and clothing and jointly seek relief. There is now one thing that inspires us: the Shanghai Vagrant Vocational Training Center has generously donated 1,000 yuan to disaster relief. The Vagrant Vocational Training Center has been operating with difficulty and has achieved remarkable results. Recently, the center invited Xu Shiying, chairman of the National Relief Commission and vice president of the Shanghai Fundraising Committee for Flood Relief in Various Provinces, to give a lecture on the situation of floods in various provinces this year. Mr. Xu sincerely recounted his personal visits to the Yangtze River, Yellow River, and northern Jiangsu areas for inspection and investigation. The sincerity of his words moved the audience. All the staff of the center made a grand vow, generously contributing from their pockets and donating a total of 1,000 yuan in national currency, which was sent to Wang Yiting, vice president of the Flood Relief Committee, to be distributed for relief purposes. The Vagrant Vocational Training Center is an organization for poor people. With the poor people's organization generously helping, who would not be willing to help others? In Shanghai alone, there are countless families with a little wealth, as well as many big merchants and wealthy people. Why not donate what you have left to help those in need? A penny's worth of alms, a piece of clothing, are all beneficial to the victims and will not be wasted. Donate one more penny, save one more life; donate ten more pennies, save ten more lives. The facts are there for all to see. Now that the north wind is howling, the wailing of tens of millions of people is spreading across the fields with the biting cold wind. We hope that the people of the country will unite and gather their strength to jointly seek emergency relief.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Jisheng Association's Tianmen Relief Report <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Association, considering the severity of the Tianmen flood, cooperated with the Chinese and Foreign Relief Association on September 19th and publicly elected Hou Yongde as the director to go with relief workers to handle emergency relief. A total of 12,000 silver dollars were remitted before and after, and Mr. Hou Yongde and others raised 2,750 silver dollars themselves, totaling 14,750 silver dollars. Rice and beans were purchased locally and distributed to 18 districts. District 5, due to transportation difficulties, was changed to cash distribution. The association recently received a report from Mr. Hou Yongde stating that the Tianmen relief work has been completed and is now being concluded. A total of 17,663 relief tickets were collected in the 1583 districts, accounting for 61,190 large mouths and 25,242 small mouths. 446 shi, 7 dou, and 6 sheng of relief rice and broad beans were distributed, and 8,134.3 silver dollars were distributed. The purchase of rice and broad beans cost 5,538.83 silver dollars. Temporary small relief, coffin expenses, freight, remittance fees, miscellaneous expenses, etc., cost 857.377 silver dollars. The construction of the Yuxin River stone bridge cost 200 silver dollars. The total cost was 14,730.507 silver dollars, leaving a surplus of 19.493 silver dollars for disposal. The relief tickets have been handed over to the Tianmen County Government for receipt. The distribution was supervised by Commissioner Shi and the County Government to show seriousness. However, winter is approaching, and the victims who have no clothes and no food are still sleeping in the open air, exposed to the wind. The conference is sympathetic to the severity of the flood disaster and has issued humanitarian relief, but the supply is far less than the demand, and it is difficult to provide thorough relief. It is hoped that continuous assistance will be provided to save the survivors, etc. After receiving the report, the association considered that Shanghai's economy is depressed and donations are dwindling. This Tianmen relief effort was indeed a difficult undertaking, but it was only a drop in the bucket, barely enough to make a difference.</p>

<p>In this port, starting from last Saturday, there was a shortage of silver coins on the market, so the exchange rate for small silver dollars varied. Although the exchange rate for silver dollars at the small money shops and cigarette paper shops in the north and south of the city did not explicitly state the exchange rate, one yuan of legal currency was only exchanged for ten jiao of small silver dollars, or 2450 cash. However, the exchange rate for copper coins was 2980-2990 cash, but the exchange rate for sauce garden merchants was 3030-3040 cash, which was as much as 240-250 cash more than the exchange rate for legal currency to jiaozi on Saturday morning.</p>

<h3 id="e118">Raw Silk Prices Soar - Silk and Satin Industries Increase Prices - New System to be Followed from Today <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Silk and Satin Industry Association and the Electrical Silk Weaving Factory Industry Association have issued a notice regarding the soaring raw material prices and increased production costs, leading to adjustments in sales prices. The notice states: "Recently, the price of raw silk has been soaring. Factory silk has risen from over 300 yuan per dan to over 900 yuan, native silk has risen from over 10 yuan per hundred liang to over 30 yuan, and rayon has risen from 280 yuan per case to over 400 yuan. This has caused the cost of making silk to increase more than twofold. If we maintain the original selling prices, the losses would be substantial. However, in consideration of the social economy and to accommodate general consumption, we do not want to drastically increase prices. Therefore, after repeated discussions at the general meetings of member representatives, we have decided, considering all aspects, that the selling price of each item should be appropriately increased. Furthermore, because there are so many varieties of silk goods, each factory and store should separately negotiate and set new prices, print price lists, and submit them to our association for submission to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Social Affairs for record. The price of silk goods is calculated by the municipal foot and municipal catty. This was approved at the meeting. Since there are too many patterns of silk and crepe goods to list, in addition to each factory and store printing and delivering their own price lists, we are issuing this special notice that from today onwards, all kinds of silk and crepe goods will be adjusted in price. It is essential that we support each other and strive for survival. As for the promotion of the new system of weights and measures, the government has issued repeated orders, and our association has also repeatedly notified all our colleagues to comply. However, we are concerned that some colleagues may be unaware of the government's decrees and still use the old system of feet and catties. If this is discovered by the competent authorities or reported, resulting in penalties, it would be their own fault. Our association cannot guarantee them.

<p>The deceased's father sues the driver - the court is discussing the case and will investigate further before the next trial</p>
<p>Xu Chunsong, 38 years old, a copper craftsman residing at 104 Shuinong, Xiaoshadu, West Shanghai, was riding his bicycle on business on the afternoon of the 14th of last month. At 2:30 PM, he was traveling from east to west on Avenue Joffre in the French Concession. When he reached number 704, a truck number Fa Er San Er Er, driven by Zhou Hequan (32 years old, resident of 8 Rongshou Lane, Xiamen Road), a Wuxi native employed by the French Public Works Department, was heading to the Tailasituo Road Small Hospital to pick up Chinese police officers who had been vaccinated at the Avenue Joffre Police Station, also traveling from east to west in the same direction as Xu. Xu did not give way to the truck, and was hit by the truck's rear fender. He was injured and immediately taken to Guangci Hospital by Zhou. Zhou reported the incident to the police station. Xu died that evening due to his injuries. The body was taken to the coroner's office. The case was reported to the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, who confirmed the death. The body was placed in a coffin by relatives. The situation was reported in this newspaper. Later, the French Police Department measured and inspected the scene of the accident and concluded that the defendant Zhou Hequan was driving properly and that the accident was caused by the deceased's carelessness. Therefore, no public prosecution was filed against the defendant. The deceased's father, Xu Daming, 58 years old, disagreed with the police department's decision and filed a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, suing Zhou Hequan for causing death by negligence. He requested a trial and compensation for damages. The court accepted the complaint and Judge Li Changnian of the Criminal Court summoned both parties for questioning on the afternoon of the previous day. Both parties arrived on time. The plaintiff first stated that his son had been killed in a car accident and knelt on the ground to beg for justice. The defendant Zhou Hequan stated that he was driving in accordance with the regulations and that the deceased did not give way, became frightened, and fell behind his car. Kang Si Dading Mi Heyi Liufu (transliteration), a person registered with the French Police Department, testified about witnessing the accident. The court ordered an investigation and rescheduled the trial for the 21st.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Divorce Case Concluded - Another Lawsuit to Confirm Parentage <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Lu Zhubao sues Xu Shenhai - mediation fails and formal litigation begins</p>
<p>Xu Shenhai, a local resident residing at 140 Liujiazhai, Jules Plaisant Road, French Concession, is a foreman in a certain machinery factory, with a wealthy life. He married Lu Zhubao, a woman from Ningbo, through a matchmaker. After they married, their relationship was very close. In the spring of last year, the couple suddenly had a quarrel, and Lu left without saying goodbye. After a long time without returning, Xu published a notice in the newspaper warning Lu. At that time, Lu's parents also published a notice in the newspaper stating that they had severed their relationship with their daughter. Lu then filed a lawsuit with the court, requesting a divorce from Xu. The litigation lasted for years, but it was still not resolved. It was not until the 3rd of this month that both parties reached an agreement, with the mediation of friends and the lawyers of both parties proving and establishing a divorce agreement. Xu paid Lu 600 yuan for alimony, and both parties officially signed the agreement and separated. The next day, Lu Zhubao filed another lawsuit with the Civil Court of the Second Special Court, requesting mediation to confirm Xu Shenhai's biological son. According to the claim, the petitioner was two months pregnant when she left home last year. On the 19th day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar, she gave birth to a son named Huifang. She had asked someone to notify Xu Shenhai of this. Xu Shenhai had been involved in litigation for a long time and was struggling financially. Therefore, he signed the divorce agreement, which stated that the child born by Xu and Lu was not Xu Shenhai's son. He was unable to agree to sign the agreement at the time, but he was forced to do so due to financial hardship. If he did not sign, the mother and son would be separated and would inevitably die together. After considering it again and again, he had no choice but to sign the agreement. After receiving the alimony, she would seek a fair judgment from the law. She did not want to starve to death, and Huifang did not want to be a fatherless child. According to the law, the relationship between father and son cannot be severed. Therefore, she is acting as the agent of Xu Huifang to file a lawsuit against Xu Shenhai to confirm parentage, requesting that the case be summoned for mediation, etc. The court accepted the complaint and Judge Wu Xiaoke specially opened the Civil Court Seven on the previous day to summon both parties for mediation. The petitioner Xu Zhuanfang was brought to the court by her legal guardian, her mother Lu Zhubao, and testified about the previous events. The opposing party, Xu Shenhai, was represented by his lawyer and expressed his objection. The court then announced that the mediation had failed and ordered the petitioner to file a formal lawsuit before adjourning the court.</p>

<p>Regarding the Shanghai Telephone Company's request to implement a call-based charging system and increase telephone fees, after the Public Works Department of the Public Concession hired telephone experts from China, Britain, the United States, and Japan to form a special committee to jointly study the report, the committee's recommendations have been accepted by the Bureau's Public Utilities Committee and the directors. It has been decided that the new system will be implemented on March 1st of next year. After the special committee concluded, the Board of Directors of the Public Works Department immediately began negotiations with the relevant authorities of the Shanghai Telephone Company for implementation. According to sources from the Dagong News Agency, the company agreed to the call-based charging, and the various prices of the new regulations proposed by the telephone experts’ report. In addition, the experts also gave additional advice on the widespread use of technical talents and the reduction of salaries for senior internal staff. They also agreed to consider improvement. However, everything still needs to be reported to the British head office before a decision can be made. At the same time, the Public Works Department has forwarded the report to the French Concession Municipal Council for reference and to solicit opinions. The French authorities are currently considering whether to implement the new system consistently with the Public Concession on March 1st of next year. However, Mr. Lei, an American expert stationed in Shanghai, visited the French authorities and French telephone experts after returning to Shanghai from Beijing, explaining the recommendations of the report in his personal capacity. According to the opinions of French experts, the new system should have no difficulties in future implementation within the French Concession.</p>

<p>The Zhabei Charity Group, in view of the fact that this city is the largest commercial port in the Far East, with a dense population and uneven quality, and that the number of unemployed vagrants is not small, and that incidents of kidnapping and robbery are often heard, the group specially petitioned the municipal government to quickly implement the Baojia system. The original presentation is recorded as follows: "It is requested to quickly implement the Baojia system to ban vagrants and maintain the business city. It is found that Shanghai is a mixed place with a large population. According to the latest survey, the population is about one million. Among them, the quality is uneven, and the number of unemployed vagrants is not small. To put it bluntly, kidnapping and robbery, to put it mildly, blackmail and theft, happen every day. Charitable merchants regard these people as snakes and scorpions. In addition, the floods in various provinces have caused disasters, and there are countless refugees who have fled to Shanghai to make a living. If this continues, a good business place may have uneasy phenomena. In the blink of an eye, the winter defense will be coming. Although there are military and police protection, it is inevitable that the villains will hide. If you want to eliminate bandits, there is nothing better than the Baojia system. The central government has long had a clear statement, and it is not far from holding it. The provinces and counties have already achieved success. This city is the largest commercial port in the Far East, with a dense population. Since the household registration has been cleared, it can still be implemented quickly. For this reason, I would like to ask your government to quickly implement the Baojia system, and all unemployed and bad elements will be strictly banned, so that Shanghai's security can be cleared without worry."</p>

<h3 id="e134">The Nanjing Road Rent Reduction Issue Urgently Awaits Resolution - The Hardoon Company and Tenants Sue Each Other in Court <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>In recent years, China's rural areas have been bankrupted, disasters have been frequent, the social economy has been exhausted, people's purchasing power has been weak, and commercial goods have been stagnant. Commerce has been declining day by day. In the early days of currency reform, follow-up measures were not yet in place. Various commodity prices, directly and indirectly, have been rising. As the price of gold rises, the cost of purchasing industrial raw materials from abroad increases, making it more difficult to sell products. Businesses will become increasingly difficult. Although Nanjing Road is known as the bustling commercial district in Shanghai, more than twenty businesses have closed down this year. Although some new businesses have opened, there are still many vacant houses. This situation is rare in decades. In addition, the rent for commercial housing on Nanjing Road is expensive. In prosperous times, the burden is indirectly passed on to consumers, and the stores themselves do not feel the pain. They are often willing to pay large amounts of rent and "digging fees," even tolerating unfair contracts that unilaterally benefit the owners, gradually cultivating the insatiable desires of owners and managers. In the spring of this year, most stores on Nanjing Road suffered from high rents and urgently sought relief by petitioning various owners to reduce rents. Except for the Hardoon Company, which consistently refused, almost all cases were resolved. It is now heard that the company and tenants have already filed lawsuits in court over the rent reduction issue. The tenants have collected evidence that other owners have indeed reduced rents and are prepared to present it to the judge at the trial, requesting that the judge, while not violating legal principles, take into account the actual commercial situation and make a fair judgment.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Bar Association sent a letter to the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau yesterday, stating: "According to a proposal from a member, when land in this city is involved in debt lawsuits and is ordered by the court to be auctioned, the court often commissions the Municipal Land Bureau to assess the price as a standard for execution of the auction. However, the Municipal Land Bureau's valuation often takes four or five months or even a year to complete, which is far slower than the rapid valuation of the current Concession's Bureau of Public Works, causing complaints from the parties to the lawsuit. It is proposed that a letter be sent to the Municipal Land Bureau, requesting that it promptly order that valuations entrusted in the future be completed within two weeks to facilitate execution, etc. This matter has been submitted to the joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee for discussion and resolution. Accordingly, we are writing to your bureau to investigate and handle the matter. If the court commissions the valuation of land prices in the future, it is hoped that you will order the matter to be completed within two weeks to facilitate convenience."</p>
<h3 id="e137">In This Port, the Total Number of Japanese-Run Food and Beverage Establishments is 102 <a href="#e137" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c137" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">137</a></h3>
<p>According to the Japanese-language "Mainichi Shimbun," a recent survey found that there are a total of 102 Japanese-run food and beverage establishments, including 43 restaurants, 40 cafes, and 18 navy-designated cafeterias, a decrease of 15 from last year. The total number of female waitresses is 318, including 270 Japanese and 42 Koreans, a decrease of 108 from last year. This is due to the depression in the market and the rapid fall of the yen, which has led them to "Manchukuo." The age of the waitresses ranges from 16 to 42, but the majority are between 18-19 and 22-23 years old. In terms of origin, those from Nagasaki and Kyushu account for the majority, followed by people from Kumamoto, Fukuoka, and Oita prefectures. Among them, 24 have received higher education, 7 are graduates of famous girls' schools in Seoul and Busan, and the rest are mostly graduates of higher primary schools. Furthermore, the situation of restaurants and cafes this year was most depressed in February, June, October, and March. Recently, the yen has risen again, and the Lunar New Year is approaching, so development is expected. However, in the past half month, due to the spread of rumors of spirits, customers have been reluctant to come.</p>

<h3 id="e140">Hu Xiyuan Writes to the Federation of Trade Unions to Advise Raw Material Merchants Not to Raise Prices Too Sharply <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Hu Xiyuan, a member of the All-China Federation of Industry and Commerce and General Manager of the Yapu Er Factory, in view of the recent sharp rise in raw materials, which has greatly affected the cost of industrial products, wrote to the Federation requesting that it find a way to advise raw material merchants not to raise prices too sharply, causing harm to all parties. The letter stated (excerpt): "Since the implementation of the legal tender, the bargaining chips have been active, and there is hope for practical relief in rural areas. The purchasing power of the interior can gradually increase, and the prices of various commodities, on the water level line, can be reasonably raised according to their own needs. Industry and commerce can gradually enter a prosperous state as a result, which is what we extremely hope for. However, in recent observations of the conditions of various industries, in this turbulent period of legal tender implementation, there is an uneven distribution of joy and sorrow. The reason for this is that the price of raw materials has risen too sharply. For example, the price of cloth has not risen as much as the price of cotton, and the price of silk has soared, but the selling price of silk products has not been fully raised. However, this may be blamed on the trend of the international trade environment, which cannot be stopped. As for the majority of miscellaneous materials needed by light industry, according to surveys, most of them have not been affected in any way. However, raw material merchants have been psychologically affected by the currency system reform and have suddenly raised prices. This is indeed numerous. Small and medium-sized factories with insufficient inventory, on the one hand, cannot increase the selling price because purchasing power has not yet increased sharply, and on the other hand, purchase high-priced raw materials, which suddenly increases costs. In this contradictory environment, we feel deep pain. As a result, the products of the manufacturing plant are wandering on divergent paths, and the transactions of raw material merchants are also hesitant to wait and see. This creates a sluggish sales situation for goods in all aspects. This kind of self-inflicted and self-created business policy should first prompt the raw material merchants to realize the need to seek mutual benefits. This association is a large group of national industries and should request that raw material merchants in various places be advised not to seek too rapid a rise in the price of various raw materials, so as to reduce their own business and increase the costs of manufacturing plants.

<p>Domestic Flying Lion Brand Lead Oxide Sells Well in Nanshi The China Lead Oxide Factory, located at the eastern end of Kangqu Road, Nanshi Manufacturing Bureau Road, produces machine-made domestic Flying Lion Brand red lead and yellow lead, which are the main raw materials for manufacturing glass, light bulbs, storage batteries, magnetic porcelain, rubber, and metal rust prevention. It has been certified by the Ministry of Industry as a first-class domestic product, and has been tested and qualified by the Central Industrial Testing Institute. Its quality is pure and can surpass imported products. Chemical plants, road bureaus, ship factories, and the electric tram company of the Bureau of Public Works, etc., have all adopted it. Recently, due to the improvement of our country's currency system and the contraction of foreign exchange, foreign goods have soared in price, and users have hesitated. However, the factory's products are still sold at flat prices because they are made entirely of domestic raw materials and save costs. Due to the congestion of orders from all parties in recent days, they are processing and manufacturing day and night to meet industrial needs. It is heard that the factory welcomes inquiries about prices or requests for samples to try out, and you can contact the factory's distribution office by calling Nanshi telephone number 21673, in order to facilitate a clear understanding of the product from the outside world.</p>

<h3 id="e155">The Path to Political System Reform (Continued) <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>(Shanghai, November of the 24th Year)</p>
<p>——Respectfully dedicated to all comrades of the Fifth National Congress of the Kuomintang and gentlemen who are fond of discussing political system reform—</p>
<p>However, while the spirit of political tutelage should be thoroughly implemented, drafting the constitution should not be delayed. Why? Because drafting a constitution is one thing, and implementing it is another. Drafting it early is beneficial for propaganda and research; delaying implementation is beneficial for careful consideration that aligns with the national conditions. The 22nd article of the Founding Program clearly stipulates: "The draft constitution should be based on the Founding Program and the achievements of the 'political tutelage' and 'constitutional governance' periods, discussed and drafted by the Legislative Yuan, and disseminated to the public for adoption and implementation when the time is right." This shows that drafting is the first step, propaganda is the second step, adoption is the third step, and implementation is the fourth and final step. What is particularly important to note is that drafting the constitution should occur after the "political tutelage" period and the "beginning of constitutional governance." Therefore, striving for effective political tutelage to enable local people to govern themselves, paving the way for the "beginning of constitutional governance," and drafting a constitution based on the experiences of both periods are not contradictory. Some people believe that the constitution conflicts with political tutelage, while others believe that the constitution must be promulgated and implemented immediately after drafting. These are all narrow-minded and rigid views.</p>
<p>The failures of the political stage in recent years lie in the abundance of institutions with unclear systems and the multitude of committee members without assuming responsibility. As a result, despite the overlapping government offices and the overflowing number of personnel, there has been no improvement in political progress or reduction in national difficulties. Therefore, if we draft a constitution that embodies the spirit of political tutelage, we must first ensure that the political institutions (i.e., government organizations) prescribed in the constitution are tightly organized and flexible, with clear systems and specific responsibilities. The government should truly exercise "governing power," ensuring that those responsible for administrative responsibilities have ample opportunity to develop their talents, strengthen their authority, and avoid excessive constraints. At the same time, in the process of implementing policies, the government must be guided and supervised by the Kuomintang, which is building the nation based on the Three Principles of the People, ensuring that national policy decisions do not deviate from the Three Principles of the People. Only in this way will the national revolution not be in vain, and only in this way will political system reform not stray into erroneous paths.</p>
<p>When the constitution is first promulgated and the preparations for constitutional governance begin, the Kuomintang must still represent the people and bear the significant responsibility of guiding and supervising the government. In other words, during this period, which we can tentatively call the "party and people co-governance period" as a transition stage from "party rule" to "people's rule," the Kuomintang is still representing the people and exercising a portion of the "political power" in reality. Since the Kuomintang's responsibilities cannot be easily dismissed, it should first examine the shortcomings in its organization over the past few years and attempt to "revitalize itself." First, the party in the past did not train its members like soldiers, leading to loose organization and lax discipline. Second, the party in the past did not implement its political program like a creed, leading to broken promises and loss of trust with the people. Third, the party in the past did not concentrate its power under one leader, leading to factions, suspicions, and exploitation by those who sow discord. Fourth, the party in the past did not make every effort to eradicate corruption, leaving the vast bureaucracy shrouded in dark miasma, blurring the people's understanding of revolutionary work. In short, the Kuomintang is ultimately the most historic and powerful party. As long as it internally reforms its organization, strengthens it, and eliminates past malpractices, it can naturally take on the responsibility of guiding and supervising the government. Kuomintang members should have this confidence: as long as members are aware, work hard, and organize tightly, they can not only build the nation but also govern it well.</p>
<p>Having briefly explained the path to political system reform that I have considered, I will now write out the main outline of the constitution draft that I hope for and the important points for revising the Kuomintang's general regulations on the left. I welcome experts to provide guidance! (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e156">A Visit to a Cannery <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Jin Huating</p>
<p>——Taikang Cannery——</p>
<p>Since China opened its doors to the world, foreign goods have flooded the market due to our inability to fully control tariffs. The outflow of cash over the years has been difficult to calculate. Even for common canned foods, biscuits, and candies, the annual imports are enormous. Fortunately, Chinese merchants have gradually become aware of this over the past twenty years, and they have established canneries one after another, imitating and researching diligently, which has enabled them to compete with foreign merchants and recover a considerable amount of lost profits. In order to understand the actual situation of the manufacture of canned foods, biscuits, candies, etc., this newspaper visited the "Taikang Cannery," which has a larger scale and more complete equipment, for a tour. The observations are recorded below for reference by those engaged in this industry.</p>
<p>The Establishment History of Taikang: The Taikang Company was founded in Jinan in the third year of the Republic of China (1914) by Mr. Le Rucheng, Mr. Xu Yongrui, and Mr. Zhuang Shikang with a capital of 10,000 yuan. It was initially an unlimited partnership that specialized in selling various Chinese and foreign foods. Later, to resist foreign goods, they imitated and manufactured their own products. After several years of research, they finally succeeded. By the seventh year of the Republic of China (1918), their products had spread throughout Shandong and the cities of Beijing and Tianjin. Wholesale business expanded from Shanghai to Hankou and other places. In the tenth year of the Republic of China (1921), it was renamed an unlimited company and registered with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce of the Beijing government. In the same year, a wholesale office was established in Shanghai. In the twelfth year of the Republic of China (1923), in view of the seafood and bamboo shoots produced in the south, a factory was built in Shanghai's Nanshi Manufacturing Bureau Road to adapt to local conditions. In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China (1927), as the products were widely sold, but limited by assets, the supply could not meet the demand. Therefore, it was reorganized into a limited company with a paid-up capital of 150,000 yuan. The following year, it was registered with the National Registration Bureau of the National Government. Le Rucheng served as general manager. In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China (1934), the general distribution office was moved to the newly built market at the intersection of Nanjing Road and Yunnan Road, and distribution offices were added in other places successively. At this time, the company's total turnover had reached 1.1 million yuan. Its products spread throughout the country and the South Seas Islands. However, at the same time, European and American merchants also set up factories in the Shanghai concessions to avoid tariff restrictions and engage in even greater dumping. From then on, the competition between Chinese and foreign companies began to intensify. In order to ensure the survival of domestic products, the company convened a shareholders' meeting, increased its capital to 500,000 yuan, and purchased a 1933-style "Great" biscuit machine from the United Kingdom to speed up production and reduce costs. It also purchased land near Fenglin Bridge in southern Shanghai to build a new factory, striving to improve its content and equipment. The entire factory is divided into three major systems: management, engineering, and administration. The engineering system has the broadest scope, including biscuit manufacturing, machine-made cans, canned food manufacturing, candy manufacturing, Western-style pastry manufacturing, Chinese-style pastry manufacturing, bread manufacturing, preserved tangerine peel manufacturing, biscuit packaging, candy packaging, and chemical testing. In addition, worker education, hygiene, and other aspects are also well-organized, making it a modern factory.</p>
<p>Manufacturing Methods of Various Products: The factory produces seven types of products: (1) Chinese pastries, (2) Western pastries, (3) bread, (4) biscuits, (5) canned goods, (6) candies, and (7) preserved tangerine peels. They are widely sold, and the canned goods and biscuits are the most profitable. The manufacturing methods and ingredients of each product are roughly as follows: First, the raw materials department has a total of 1,200 kinds, divided into oil and spices. Two-thirds are domestic, and one-third are imported. Second, the Chinese pastry manufacturing department mostly relies on manual labor, using 40% eggs, 30% flour, 25% sugar, and 15% yeast to make various Chinese pastries, which are baked. Third, the Western pastry manufacturing department uses 20% butter, 20% flour, 40% eggs, and 20% sugar and yeast to make various Western pastries, which are steamed. Fourth, the bread manufacturing department first mixes flour and yeast, then ferments for six hours, and finally bakes in an oven. The working hours are from 7 pm to 2 am the next morning, and the daily output is based on the amount of orders received in the afternoon and evening. Fifth, the canned goods manufacturing and seasoning department first sends the raw materials to the manufacturing department for washing after being identified by the chemical laboratory, and then cooks and cans them separately. There are a total of 105 flavors, divided into five categories: fish, meat, game, vegetables, and fruits. Sixth, the can welding department is used to repair and weld various cans. Seventh, the equipment department is used to repair various machines. Eighth, the machine and furnace room is used to power the machines and boilers in various departments. Ninth, the machine-made can department specializes in manufacturing various cans. The iron sheets used are entirely purchased from the United Kingdom and the United States. Each box weighs 200 pounds, with 112 sheets, worth about 40 yuan in national currency. After the cans are made, they must be transferred to a vacuum machine and a water tank for disinfection before they can be used. Tenth, the biscuit manufacturing department is divided into five steps: (A) Mixing, which involves mixing 70% flour, 20% sugar, and 10% yeast with a machine. There are more than 40 kinds. High-quality biscuits use more foreign materials, accounting for about 40%, while medium and low-quality ones use less, accounting for about 15%. (B) Rolling skin, after the mixed raw materials are mixed, they are transferred to a rolling machine to roll the raw materials into thin skin, and then cleaned with a brush. (C) Printing, after the thin skin is cleaned with a brush, it is immediately passed through a printing machine to print various patterns on the biscuits and cut them into squares at the same time. (D) Baking, after being cut into squares, they are immediately sent into a 450-degree oven, entering and exiting at the same time, with a baking time of five minutes, and then the finished product is obtained. (E) Packaging, the baked biscuits are sent to the packaging department for packaging or canning. In addition, the procedures for candies and preserved plums are very simple. Candies only need to mix sugar with peanuts, melon seeds, meat, or walnuts and cut them into squares. Preserved plums only need to collect a large amount of green plums when they are on the market, pickle them with salt first, dry them after a certain period of time, and then crush them so that they can be added with various ingredients to make various preserved plums at any time.</p>
<p>Special Chemical Testing Laboratory: In order to ensure that various products meet hygiene regulations, the factory has established a chemical testing laboratory in the general factory, specializing in testing various raw materials and products for other unhealthy or toxic substances, especially for canned foods such as fish, meat, and game, paying extra attention.</p>
<p>Business Overview and Others: The factory has a capital of 500,000 yuan. The business has been good over the years. Last year, the total turnover reached as high as 2 million yuan. There are six distribution departments in Shanghai, and more than 1,300 sales agents across the country. The daily consumption of eggs is 500 pounds, and the consumption of flour is 250 bags (the output of the new factory). The entire factory has more than 230 male workers and more than 200 female workers, implementing a contract system. The monthly income of each worker is about 12 or 13 yuan. The monthly salary of technical foremen is as high as 120 yuan. The factory base covers more than 18 acres. In addition to the self-built factory buildings, offices, and halls, workers' dormitories and workers' family dormitories are also attached to accommodate the workers and their families. The rent for each apartment is only 5 yuan per month, so all male and female workers are very happy.</p>

<h3 id="e157">Defeat Shaker, Tung Wah Wins by Nine Goals <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Russian Army Unable to Catch Up, Achieves Nothing</p>
<p>—A Glimpse of Yesterday's Western Union A League Match—</p>
<p>In the Western Union A League match, Tung Wah played against Shaker. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the match was held at Shen Garden. Tung Wah, a well-trained and experienced team, faced Shaker, an unknown team. The outcome was expected by fans. As a result, Shaker suffered a complete defeat, and Tung Wah won by nine goals. Fans returned home happy. However, due to the continuous rain, the Shen Garden field was still muddy yesterday morning. The players of both teams were covered in mud. The details of yesterday's match are as follows:</p>
<p>Iron Leg Opens the Scoring: Referee He Chunhui blew the whistle, and both sides began to clash. The Russian army attacked twice but failed. For more than ten minutes, there was no progress. The fans were very anxious. Sun Tie-tui accidentally touched the ball with his hand twice, but fortunately, it was in the middle line, and no trouble was caused. Then, at the Russian gate, he made a prone shot with a beautiful posture, but it was caught. Soon, the Russian left inside forward violated the rules, and Sun Tie-tui kicked the ball in. The goalkeeper watched the ball go in and could not save it. Cao Qiuting arrived late and joined the battle. His luck came, and the ball happened to be at his feet. He rushed out smoothly, hooked at the baseline, and Yi Chen touched it just right, scoring again. Tung Wah's arrogance was immense. The Russian army's position was repeatedly trampled by iron riders. Shang Xiang's left-corner long shot was a pity because it was caught. Youliang mainly opened the corner kick, but there was a lack of response. The Russian army repeatedly tried to counterattack, but Tung Wah's defense was tight, and it was difficult to succeed. Youliang then came from the right corner, and Qiuting waited right there, pushed it slightly, and the Russian army suffered another injury. The first half ended with Tung Wah leading by three goals.</p>
<p>Russian Army's Gate Wide Open: Switching sides to fight again, Tung Wah was like a deserted place. The Russian army managed to win a goal with great difficulty, but it was abandoned because Ericson was offside. Ericson atoned for his sins and charged straight in, hooking at the baseline. Brother Heng was quick-witted and averted the danger. Xuesi's mistake committed a major crime and was sentenced to death. Li Yichen's main kick was unsuccessful. Qiuting started an uprising, and Yichen kicked it fiercely, and the goalkeeper fell down with the ball. Zhang Jinhai watched with envy and also scored a goal. The Russian army lost five goals in a row and desperately counterattacked, but still failed to succeed. Ai Po Li Kao Fu committed another crime, and Guan Xun'an flew from the sky to rescue. Zhou Guangzhong fell into a pile regardless of his own safety. After that, both sides made no progress. Suddenly, Ericson sneaked into Yinping. Tung Wah's interior was empty, and Brother Heng blocked it alone, overcoming the difficulties. Cao Qiuting launched an uprising on the border and shot remotely at the gate, and Tung Wah unexpectedly gained another harvest. The Russian army was frustrated. Xu Nuo Nuo Fu fouled, and Yichen's main hearing declared victory again. Youliang was happy to see the victory and also scored one. Qiuting got a high ball and passed it to Yichen. With a loud bang, he hit the net nest again. In the end, Tung Wah won by nine goals, and Shaker kept the egg. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Xu Heng Yang Ning Guan Xun'an Gu Shangqin Feng Yunyou Zhou Guangzhong Cao Qiuting</p>
<p>Sun Jinshun Li Yichen Zhang Jinhai Jia Youliang</p>

<p>Cheng Yize Scores the First Goal Without Effort Ennis' Ball Luck is Poor, Losing 1-0</p>
<p>In the Western Union B League soccer match, You You faced Ennis. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, they met at Jiaozhou Park. You You's strength has increased sharply since the addition of Xiao Hei Tan Chen Zhenhe. Ennis was the champion of the previous season, eyeing the title covetously and seemingly arrogant. However, yesterday, they were defeated by You You 1-0. The details of yesterday's match are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Cheng Yize Cleverly Scores the First Goal: Ennis came out in military uniform to practice their kicks. You You followed. Referee Hair blew the whistle, and the two armies lined up against each other. The English army took the lead, and the five forwards rushed in unison. You You was unwilling to show weakness and resisted the troops. The two sides fought fiercely and were evenly matched. They held each other for a quarter of an hour. You You repeatedly tried to raid, but their kicks were not accurate and failed to hit the target. The English army became angry and charged again. You You fouled, and Nick mainly kicked 15 yards. Unexpectedly, it turned into a baseball, making the fans sweat profusely. You You turned bad luck into good luck, and Qiao Sheng worked together to smuggle across Chencang, killing to the English army's hinterland. Qiao Sheng used a clever plan to deceive Xun Na and pounced to the ground. The ball reached the front of the English army's gate, and Boss Cheng Yize caught it right, reaping the benefits of the fisherman and returning with success. The first half ended.</p>
<p>Ennis Fled in Defeat: You You won 1-0. Switching sides after the lemon, the English army waved their arms and stood up straight. Middle Army Da Haiti led the three armies and attacked fiercely. You You could not stop it in time, and the momentum was like a broken bamboo. Three passes were lost. Xue Liqin pulled up his hairy legs and shot. Zhang Rongcai did not panic and calmly pushed out Aji. The fans cheered loudly. Xue Liqin's ashes were revived and he made a comeback, repeatedly breaking through You You's defense line. Zhang Rong made a meritorious rescue and averted the danger. Da Haiti was ashamed and angry and broke into the camp alone. He raised a foot and hit the goal post and bounced back. Xue Liqin rose again, but his ball luck was poor, and he failed again. After that, it was bustling, and nothing was gained. Not long after, the gong was struck to withdraw the troops. The English army fled in defeat. The lineups of both sides are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>You You Team</p>
<p>Zhang Rongcai Zhang Rong Zhu Qiu</p>
<p>Chen Zhenhe Chen Zhenxiang</p>

<p>Dispute Arises</p>
<p>Yesterday at 11:50 AM, during the first half of the match between Bailiang and Luguangnan, Luguangnan was behind by one goal. In the second half, after only 15 minutes, they were behind by two more goals. The entire team of players, overly concerned with winning and losing, acted impulsively and frequently engaged in improper behavior. Two players were penalized and ejected by the referee one after another. One of the players, Chen Yourong, became angry with the opposing team and deliberately stepped on the leg of an opponent, attempting to injure him. Fortunately, the opposing player quickly dodged and avoided danger. Unable to achieve his goal, Chen Yourong then punched the player. The referee witnessed this behavior and immediately ordered Chen Yourong to leave the field according to the rules. After being judged, Chen Yourong not only refused to comply but also sought someone to attack. His teammates Yue Weixin and others, as well as spectators close to the team, also joined in the violence. Although the Bailiang team avoided confrontation, the order of the field was disrupted, making it impossible to continue the game. Afterwards, the team's players gathered near the waiting area and major roads, determined to seek revenge on the Bailiang team. With the escort of the field staff and notification to the police, they were able to escape danger. Subsequently, the school association convened a committee, which resolved that Chen Yourong and Yue Weixin of the Luguangnan team, showing hostility towards the opposing team and exhibiting barbaric behavior, would have their team's competition qualifications revoked in accordance with Article 5 of the association's charter and Article 4 of the team participation guidelines. From then on, they would not be allowed to participate in any competitions organized by the field, as a warning to those who despise sportsmanship.</p>
<p>In addition, during yesterday's match between Minqiang and Fangrui, Minqiang had an unregistered player participate in the game. According to the rules, the entire team's competition qualification was revoked.</p>

<p>Ministry of Education Instructs Jiangsu Education Department to Notify</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education has strict restrictions on the acceptance of transfer students to normal schools. According to the provisions of Article 78 of the regulations, they must have a transfer certificate or transcript from another normal school with matching semesters and pass the placement examination to be qualified. The Jiangsu Education Department recently reported that each term, when recruiting transfer students, there are very few scholars from other normal schools. However, first-year high school students, either because they aspire to study normal education or because they cannot afford the expenses and receive free treatment, have requested to transfer. According to the rules, this is not in compliance. Considering that the students have potential, and that there is a shortage of teachers as compulsory education is being promoted, can we make an exception to cultivate talent? The Education Department forwarded the request to the Ministry of Education for review. Yesterday, the Ministry of Education instructed that the acceptance of transfer students to grades above the second semester of normal schools is limited to those who have the qualifications for matching semesters from similar schools. The proposal to allow high school students to transfer to normal schools for study should not be considered.</p>

<h3 id="e175">Polish Embassy Introduces Polish Education Situation <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>To provide reference for those who aspire to study in Poland.</p>
<p>The Polish government has specially established a scholarship for Chinese students, and the Ministry of Education held exams on the 15th and 16th of this month, as reported in various newspapers. Regarding the situation of Polish education and admission procedures, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs inquired with the Polish Embassy, which has responded with detailed information and instructed the Ministry of Education to announce it to all universities, so as to provide reference for those who aspire to study in Poland. The following is an excerpt of the Polish education situation:</p>
<p>Polish Education</p>
<p>Cracow, founded by King Kagimeijz in 1364, is a world-renowned academic institution. The astronomer Nicolas Copernicus once studied deeply there. Polish education continued to progress without interruption in the 16th and 17th centuries. Unfortunately, the progress of education was interrupted by the division of the 18th century. Poland established the Commission of National Education in 1773, which was the beginning of the European Ministry of Education. In 1918, Poland restored its country, and everything old was renewed. The government and people suffered from the pain of the Great War and the Russian-Polish War, as well as the hardship of economic chaos. However, they spared no effort in the construction of education, so the results were remarkable. Recently, there have been 22 universities.</p>
<p>Two Types of Secondary Schools</p>
<p>There are two types of secondary schools in Poland. Type A includes Latin, and Type B does not include Latin but focuses on mathematics and physics. After passing the secondary school graduation examination, students can enter any commercial, agricultural, or other university. The average age of first-year university students is about 19 years old. The Senate, an organization of professors headed by the Rector Magnificas, manages the school's academics. The language used in Polish universities is Polish, which is different from German, French, and Russian.</p>
<p>Five National Universities</p>
<p>There are five national universities with an annual budget of approximately 31 million Solys, equivalent to 16 million Chinese dollars. There are more than 680 teaching staff and more than 2,000 assistant teachers. (1) Csacow University, one of the oldest universities in Europe, has 7,000 male and female students and offers courses in law, theology, medicine, literature, and science. (2) Warasw University, founded in the 16th century, has five departments: law, theology, medicine, literature, and science. There are more than 3,000 students. (3) Lwow University, founded in the 17th century, has four departments: law, theology, medicine, literature, and science. The number of students is often more than 2,000. (4) Warasw University, founded in 1817, is the largest university with departments of law, theology, medicine, literature, pharmacology, and veterinary medicine. There are more than 10,000 students. (5) Poznan University, founded in 1920, has agricultural and forestry departments in addition to ordinary departments. There are approximately 4,000 students.</p>
<p>Other Specialized Schools</p>
<p>(1) The Warsaw Institute of Technology has seven departments: engineering, architecture, machinery, water conservancy, electrical engineering, chemistry, and surveying. There are approximately 2,000 students. (2) The Lwow Institute of Technology has six departments: engineering, architecture, mechanical chemistry, agriculture and forestry. There are approximately 2,000 students. (3) The Crawow Mining School has two departments: mining and metallurgy. It is the only school that studies this engineering field. There are approximately 600 students. (4) The Warsaw Higher Agricultural School has three departments: agriculture, forestry, and horticulture. Poland is an agricultural country, and agriculture has been extremely developed in recent years. New methods are used for cultivation. The students of this school use the summer vacation to work in the countryside for practical work, and at the same time, they can study rural agriculture, loan consumption cooperatives, local autonomy, public health, and public education. (5) The Warsaw Higher School of Commerce is a private school, but under special legislation, it enjoys the same rights as other higher schools. There are approximately 1,800 students. (6) The Warsaw Higher School of Political Economy is also a registered private school.</p>
<p>Low Living Expenses</p>
<p>Living expenses in Poland are quite low, especially for students. It is easy to find accommodation in major cities. The Academic Home has rooms for one, two, four, or six people to live in. It is also possible to live in private homes. The monthly cost of board and lodging is equivalent to 75 Chinese dollars. Living expenses in Warsaw are more expensive, while Wilno is cheaper. As for expenses, if calculated at 200 Slola per month, the annual cost is only 1,200 Chinese dollars.</p>
<p>Duration and Degrees</p>
<p>Those who study law need an average of about four years. After passing the final examination, they are awarded a Magister of Low degree. To obtain a doctorate, they must write another thesis after obtaining this degree. Those who study medicine must study for more than five years, and after passing the examination, they are awarded the degree of doctor. Higher specialized schools must study for at least five to seven years before awarding an engineering degree. The courses at the Higher School of Commerce take about four years to complete. The courses at the Higher School of Agriculture take about three years to complete. After passing the examination, they are awarded an agricultural engineering degree.</p>

After the ceremony, Tao Guangchuan, the director of the district, presided over the meeting, reported on the preparations, and explained the significance of the meeting and encouraged the students to learn to read. His words were quite substantial, and the entire venue was moved. The speech by the representative of the Literacy Education Association and the speech by Sun Letao, the director of moral education from Jingye Middle and Elementary School, were both encouraging and cautionary. Finally, students from Jingye Middle and Elementary School performed harmonica, dance, string and bamboo music, new plays, and scientific lectures. The company's amusement park added a large set of magic performances. When the meeting ended, the literacy school students were given scientific magic mirrors and serial tickets to add to their enjoyment.</p>

<p>After he was seated and the room was quiet, Mrs. Jo, who was sitting nearby showing Demi picture cards, said in a concerned tone, while nodding towards the various treasures still in Don's hands:</p>
<p>"Where did you learn so much about these things?"</p>
<p>"I've always loved these things, but I didn't know much about them. Fortunately, I met Mr. Hyde, and he told me so much."</p>
<p>"Who is Mr. Hyde?"</p>
<p>"Oh, he lives in the woods and studies these things - I don't know what you call him - writing about fish and other things. He lives at Mr. Bay's place and often asks me to help him. It's very interesting because he tells me so much, and he's a very pleasant and smart person. I hope I can see him again someday."</p>
<p>Mrs. Jo also said, "I hope you will," because Don's eyes had already lit up, and he was enthusiastically discussing this matter, reversing his usual quiet and reserved state.</p>
<p>"Oh, he can get birds to come to him, and rabbits and squirrels don't avoid him at all, as if he were a tree. He never hurts them, and they seem to recognize him. Have you ever tickled a lizard with a piece of grass?" Don suddenly asked eagerly.</p>
<p>"No, but I'd like to try it."</p>
<p>"Oh, I've done it. It's so funny to watch them stretch out their bodies and turn around. They like you doing that. Mr. Hyde often does that; he whistles to attract snakes to listen to him. He knows exactly when that flower will bloom, and bees won't sting him. He knows many wonderful things about fish, flies, aborigines, rocks, etc."</p>

<h3 id="e178">A Review of China's Tung Oil Foreign Trade <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Li Junsi</p>
<p>I</p>
<p>Tung oil is originally a special product of China and an indispensable raw material for the paint industry. In recent years, on the one hand, the silk and tea, which used to occupy an important position in the country's export trade, have gradually declined. On the other hand, due to the urgent need for tung oil in various countries around the world, the export of tung oil has rapidly increased. Especially in recent years, its significant progress in international trade has not only kept pace with silk, tea, and other commodities, ranking among the important ones, but also seems to have a tendency to rise and replace them. For example, in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, the total export quantity of the four major commodities of silk, tea, summer cloth, and tung oil was 1,806,033 dan, while the export quantity of tung oil was 1,246,847 dan, accounting for more than 69% of the total. In terms of value, the total export value of the four major commodities was 85,594,922 yuan, of which the export value of tung oil was 30,261,269 yuan, accounting for more than 35% of the total value. From this, it can be seen that the foreign trade of tung oil is no less than that of silk and tea. Under the annual huge trade deficit and the universal decline in foreign trade of various commodities, this phenomenon is not unwelcome and can be used as a way to fill part of the trade deficit. In the international trade war, is it possible to maintain its forward momentum permanently? Undoubtedly, these are all issues worthy of our attention. The task of this article is to provide a considerable review of these issues in order to understand its current situation and future prospects.</p>
<p>II</p>
<p>Before we examine the current situation of tung oil foreign trade, we must first conduct a simple review of its past.</p>
<p>The foreign trade of tung oil in China started in the mid-19th century. As early as the eighth year of Tongzhi (1869), tung oil was first shipped to the United States. However, the quantity exported at that time was small and the value was low, so it did not attract general attention. However, the paint industry in various countries gradually developed, and the use of industrial raw materials became increasingly widespread. Therefore, by the seventh year of the Republic of China, there were 16 places in the world selling tung oil from China. By the ninth year of the Republic, it had expanded to 18 places. As of the year before last, 26 countries needed tung oil from China, but the quantities varied. The United States, Hong Kong, the United Kingdom, the Netherlands, Denmark, Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, Norway, Japan, as well as Australia, Korea, and the leased territory of Kwantung, are the main countries exporting tung oil from China. Under this circumstance, as the foreign market for tung oil gradually expanded, and the demand from various countries gradually increased, the corresponding increase in the export of tung oil was inevitable. Therefore, China's foreign trade in tung oil is developing at a high speed. If we compare the highest export value in the 19th year of the Republic of China with the export value of tung oil during the Tongzhi period, we don’t know how many times it has differed. Even compared with the export value of the first year of the Republic of China, it is incomparable. We can understand the increasing trend of tung oil exports by looking at the following table. In this table, we see that since the first year of the Republic of China, the export of tung oil has not permanently maintained an upward trend, and there have been significant declines in between. However, if we try to list the sum of the quantity and value of its exports from the first year of the Republic of China to the twentieth year of the Republic of China in five-year periods, then its rapid progress can be clearly demonstrated:</p>

<p>Year 23 652,8 36,036,683</p>
<p>(Quintals)</p>
<p>In the above table, we can also see that since the 15th year of the Republic of China, the value of tung oil exported from China has shown a rising trend. Overall, in these five years, it has more than doubled. However, since the 20th year of the Republic of China, it has been fluctuating, far less than in the 19th year. The reason is that the Yangtze River basin suffered a major flood in the 20th year of the Republic of China, which greatly affected the tung oil production area, so the output of tung oil decreased sharply. In terms of trade, it showed a sharp decline. By the 21st year of the Republic of China, inheriting the aftermath of last year's flood, production was even lower, and trade became even more sluggish. Until the summer of the 22nd year, because the United States abandoned the gold standard, all prices rose, and the United States was the largest customer for tung oil from China, so the inland oil mills increased production, resulting in a large increase in output and smooth sales. However, by the 23rd year, the figures declined again due to the general economic downturn in the world and the difficulty in exporting Chinese goods due to the increase in silver prices in the United States.</p>
<p>However, since this year, the foreign trade of tung oil seems to have a revitalized outlook, and in terms of figures, there are remarkable achievements. According to the statistics of the International Trade Herald, the export of tung oil in the first half of this year accounted for the largest (June) 10.9% and the smallest (February) 4.2% of the total value of monthly local product exports. In the six months from January to June, March, April, May and June ranked first in foreign exports, and did not reach the high and low levels of the 19th year.</p>
<p>III</p>
<p>Although the foreign trade of tung oil has had a relatively prosperous development recently, and the future seems to have unlimited hope, we should consider whether its management methods are reasonable? Whether there is consistent contact in terms of transactions? Whether the method of tung oil extraction is scientific? Whether there are adequate facilities for domestic transportation? We can find that the organization of tung oil trade is entirely built on an unsound foundation, and there are great internal contradictions. Regarding this, we can examine it from two aspects:</p>
<p>(1) Extraction and refining - Regarding extraction, there is no need to say that the method of extracting tung oil in China, like everything else, is sticking to the old ways. The procedures for extracting tung oil are roughly as follows: first, the tung seeds are picked from the tung tree, peeled off the outer shell, washed with clean water, dried in the sun, and after drying, ground into fine powder. Then, they are placed in a wooden steamer for steaming. After steaming for about half an hour, they are taken out and placed in a hoop, wrapped in hemp cloth, made into a cake shape, and then placed in a press to extract the oil. Under high pressure, liquid will flow out of the press, and this flowing out is the tung oil. However, the tung oil extracted by this old method must go through batches of procedures and pass through many unclean utensils. Let’s not talk about the deliberate adulteration of miscellaneous oils by unscrupulous merchants to reduce the quality. Even if ordinary legitimate merchants try their best to maintain its purity and improve its quality, it is undoubtedly extremely difficult under such circumstances. In this way, the old method of oil extraction, which is individually operated and cannot be expanded to large-scale collective operation, often makes the quality and grade of the extracted oil inconsistent and fail to meet the standards. Therefore, it is easy to have a negative impact on the reputation in international trade. For this reason, tung oil sold abroad must generally be refined again after extraction to improve its quality. But when it comes to the refining of tung oil, it is really a huge stain in the history of tung oil trade. The fact is that since China's tung oil foreign trade started, it has not even had an oil refinery, so it has to rely on foreigners, because foreign oil refineries are not lacking in China. The oil refineries operated by foreigners in China are mostly concentrated in Hankou. Among these many factories, the largest is undoubtedly the American firm Qi Lai Yanghang. The oil tank of Qi Lai Yanghang can hold 3,500 tons of tung oil at a time. The second largest is the oil tank of Mobil Oil Refinery, which also has a capacity of 1,500 tons. Other foreign firms such as Mitsui and Mitsubishi of Japan, Anli and Jardine Matheson of the United Kingdom all have oil refining equipment. Although the capacity is smaller, it can refine an average of more than 1,000 tons of oil. Not long ago, Jardine Matheson established a small-scale oil refining pond in Yichang with a capacity of about 100 tons, which was very convenient for local oil merchants. Because once the tung oil is put into the pond for refining, the moisture in the oil is extracted by steam method, and the slag is also precipitated. Not only is the oil clean and transparent, but also the color is pure yellow, and the quality of tung oil can be improved a lot. But unfortunately, the establishment of each oil refinery is all foreign capital.</p>
<p>(2) Transportation Regarding transportation, the overseas transportation of tung oil exported abroad is beyond our reach and need not be discussed. Even domestic transportation must rely on foreigners, which has to be said to be a painful thing. We know that the tung-producing areas in China include Jiangsu, Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Yunnan, Guizhou, Fujian, Guangdong, Guangxi and other provinces, with an area of no less than tens of thousands of square miles. Among the shipments of tung oil from these provinces, except for Guangdong and Guangxi, which are centered on Hong Kong, and Zhejiang, Anhui, and Jiangsu, which are centered on Shanghai, the tung oil from Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan are mostly concentrated in the two ports of Wanxian and Hankou. Chongqing, Yichang, Changsha and other places have invisibly become distribution centers for tung oil. Because tung oil is collected sporadically from inland villages and towns, it must be transported to the distribution centers to wait for loading. For example, tung oil from western Sichuan is concentrated in Chongqing, and then transshipped to Wanxian or Hankou, and then sold to foreign merchants or shipped abroad. The ordinary freight from Chongqing to Hankou is 20 yuan per ton, and it only costs about 10 yuan from Yichang to Hankou. But the ships we see transporting tung oil are all foreign ships. There are very few Chinese merchant ships. why? Because tung oil is not like other dry cargo, the transporting ships must have oil tank equipment, but none of the Chinese Yangtze River steamships have this equipment, so tung oil merchants have to resort to foreign ships. However, several years ago, foreign ships did not have this oil tank equipment, so tung oil transportation had to be transshipped in Yichang and transferred to the tung oil iron barges of Taikoo and Jardine Matheson. However, foreign capital is strong and farsighted. Seeing that tung oil is the main cargo of Yangtze River freight, the quantity needed to be transported is large, and the profit is also large, so the newly built ships are specially equipped with oil tanks in order to monopolize the transportation of tung oil. This formed a situation in which foreign ships manipulated the transportation of tung oil. Under this circumstance, foreign ships often arbitrarily increase freight rates, which increases the cost of tung oil. The increase in the cost of tung oil often has a negative impact on foreign exports.</p>
<p>From the above two points, we can see that except for planting, most of the operation of tung oil is entrusted to foreigners. So, is the rise of this commodity to an important position in export trade a sound development? Are the tens of millions of transactions each year falling into the hands of the Chinese? Needless to say, it is already clear!</p>
<p>IV</p>
<p>From the previous section, we have understood that the so-called foreign trade of tung oil, which occupies an important position in China's local product exports, is originally manipulated by foreign merchants. In this section, we will look forward to its future.</p>
<p>According to factual reports, we know that since tung oil was first exported to the United States, the United States has always been the largest customer in China's tung oil trade. Not to mention the past, even looking at recent years, its position is becoming increasingly important, which is a very obvious fact. The following table shows the percentage of Chinese tung oil exported to the United States in the total number in the past six years:</p>
<p>Year Export Total Index Number of Dan Imported to the United States Percentage</p>
<p>Republic of China Year 18 1,069,650 735,244 68.7</p>
<p>Year 19 1,167,255 874,006 75.0</p>
<p>Year 20 864,864 549,600 63.5</p>
<p>Year 21 802,669 495,792 60.4</p>
<p>Year 22 1,246,847 899,100 70.5</p>
<p>Year 23 115,826 410,190 65.5</p>
<p>(Quintals) (Quintals)</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that the average annual tung oil shipped to the United States accounts for about 70% of the total. Since the United States accounts for such a huge proportion, if it suddenly does not use tung oil from China, China will suddenly lose a very large customer. Although there are still 30% of the customers, it will inevitably fall into a bleak and sluggish state, and it is impossible to avoid this result. Moreover, at this time, it is still doubtful whether this 30% of the customers can be maintained. Therefore, in the tung oil trade, the United States and China have a very close relationship. But let's see what attitude the United States government and the public hold towards using tung oil from China. Of course, tung oil has become an indispensable raw material in industry today, and it has to continue to purchase from China for the time being. However, on the other hand, in order to prevent the huge annual leakage, almost the entire country is enthusiastically promoting tung tree planting. According to general estimates, each acre of tung trees can produce two tons of tung fruit. If the selling price per ton is 20-25 yuan, then each acre can earn 40-50 yuan, which is more profitable than growing coffee. Moreover, there are also oil cake and other income. At the same time, after the tung fruit is sold to the factory, the factory can still make a lot of profit, because assuming the price of tung is 15 yuan per ton, and its oil content is 20%, then the price of tung oil per pound after extraction is only 5-6 cents, which is 3-4 cents more than the current market price of 8-10 cents. In practice, if the manufacturing methods of the factory are more precise and the distribution management is more scientific, the gains will be even greater. Therefore, the United States government and the public are actively building large-scale factories and enthusiastically promoting tung tree planting. Although most of the provinces have not achieved good results, Florida has expanded from 20,000 acres of tung trees planted in 1924 to 40,000 acres, and the number of tung trees has reached 4 million, which is undoubtedly a huge threat to the future of China's tung oil trade.</p>
<p>At the same time, we see that other countries that account for the top three of China's tung oil exports are also enthusiastically promoting tung tree planting, just like the United States. In the United Kingdom, since the Oil Consultant Committee of the Royal Society and the paint industrialists cooperated to purchase a large number of tung seeds from China and the United States, they have distributed them to various territories for trial planting. According to recent reports, Australia, New Zealand, India, Burma, Ceylon, Malaya, the Union of South Africa, Sudan, the West Indies, Honduras, and other British territories have achieved considerable results, and the future is still limitless. In addition, all aspects have achieved good results: Argentina has planted 50,000 tung trees, Paraguay has planted 30,000 tung trees, and Russia has planted 900 acres. It is now planning to plant 36,000 acres of tung trees in 1937. Other countries such as Italy and Central and South American countries have purchased a large number of tung seeds from the United States for trial planting. But? We know that the growth of tung trees to oil extraction requires a lot of time, so at present, it is not easy for countries around the world to achieve self-sufficiency in tung oil. Therefore, China's foreign trade in tung oil will not be abandoned in the international market for a while. However, in the near future, after the tung tree planting business in various countries is effective, they will collect their own seeds for oil extraction and no longer need to purchase from China. This is an inevitable fact. At that time, China's foreign exports of tung oil will inevitably deteriorate and fall into a tragic situation. Hundreds of thousands of people across the country who directly and indirectly depend on tung tree planting will inevitably be severely affected, because China's own tung oil demand is very limited, and most of the tung oil is prepared for export abroad.</p>
<p>In the end, I have to say: the reason why China's tung oil has a special development is nothing more than taking advantage of geographical advantages! Because the soil and climate in the southern part of China are most suitable for planting tung trees, and the most developed are those planted in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River and the Guijiang River basin. However, this advantage of natural geography will become a historical relic and gradually fail. However, we must not be discouraged. We must use this advantage of natural geography to select good varieties and eliminate inferior varieties on the one hand, and use scientific methods to extract and refine oil to reduce costs on the other hand. As for improving transportation and establishing close contact with the financial community, it is an indispensable task. In short, whether China's tung oil can permanently maintain its glorious position in the world market and not become a sequel to silk and tea depends entirely on the Chinese people's rapid pursuit and determination to improve and make prior rescues.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Inside Story of the Global Crude Oil Struggle <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Nai Gong</p>
<p>More than sixty years ago, crude oil was only used for treating women's cancer. But now, whether in industry, transportation, or especially in the military, crude oil has become an indispensable protagonist. During the European War, the French "Tiger" Georges Clemenceau once said, "A drop of crude oil is as precious as a drop of blood." No wonder there have been many disputes among countries recently, with the crude oil issue as their focus. Examples include the exploitation of crude oil in Northern Sakhalin by Japan and Russia, and the issue of concessions for oil fields in Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Regarding the production, use, and extraction technology of crude oil, many scholars in China have provided detailed introductions. What this article describes now is the inside story of the crude oil struggle among various countries. On the one hand, we can see the acuteness of the competition for crude oil among countries; at the same time, we can see that they have grand plans and steps for everything, unlike China, which lacks foresight.</p>
<p>(1) The Seizure of the Persian Crude Oil Mining Rights</p>
<p>More than twenty years before the European War, the Persian King Naser al-Din Shah Qajar was never willing to provide assistance to Europeans and Americans. He only allowed a small number of Europeans to travel within Persia. At that time, Canadian engineer William Knox D'Arcy was one of them. D'Arcy knew that in the past, near many churches in Persia, there were often eternal sacred flames; and on the opposite shore of the Caspian Sea, Russia had already been engaged in crude oil extraction; therefore, he concluded that Persia must have crude oil mines, so he decided to explore on the ground.</p>
<p>D'Arcy traveled all over Persia, but he never found what he was looking for. He lost a lot of money, but he did not lose his faith in himself or his faith in God. During his travels, in addition to carrying necessary equipment, maps, and books, he also carried images of Jesus and the Bible. Later, the money lost reached as much as 10 million francs; his spirit and perseverance made British financiers very excited, so they provided D'Arcy with financial assistance. However, the crude oil mine was never found, and the British financiers treated D'Arcy with contempt; therefore, D'Arcy also became disheartened.</p>
<p>D'Arcy stopped searching for oil fields and instead helped the Persian king develop various businesses. He built a short railway and also engaged in machinery trade. In 1901, the Persian king granted him a "Charter." In the "Charter," the king allowed D'Arcy and his followers and successors the freedom to explore and exploit any minerals in Persia for seventy years. Regardless of whether minerals were discovered or not, the "Charter" itself already had great value. At the same time, just as this "Charter" was being granted, D'Arcy received a report that crude oil mines had been discovered in Shushtar, southern Persia. D'Arcy felt very happy. People used to call him a Utopian idealist, but now he could prove the correctness of his beliefs.</p>
<p>However, D'Arcy no longer had the willingness and courage to operate the oil mine. He wanted to return to England and spend his remaining years. Someone offered one million pounds sterling to buy his "Charter," but he was unwilling. Later, it was increased to six million pounds sterling, but D'Arcy was still unmoved. He recalled his life, the indifference of London financiers towards him, and the Persian king's favor towards him. He was unwilling for Persia to become a place for others to compete. He was old and no longer had any hope in life. He only wanted to rest and spend his remaining years leisurely. At this time, D'Arcy was surrounded by merchants and detectives who wanted to obtain this "Charter." So he secretly took a boat to the United States, hoping to return to Canada.</p>
<p>On the ship, D'Arcy absolutely did not talk to anyone. He prayed to God and read the Bible. When the ship passed through Africa, a clergyman also took this ship to the United States. Later, D'Arcy gradually became acquainted with this clergyman and told him about his attachment to Persia and his willingness to pray for Persia. When the ship was two days away from New York, D'Arcy told the clergyman all about his life, the Persian king's favor towards him, and the granting of the "Charter." This clergyman listened to D'Arcy's words without saying a word, seeming not very interested. Later, he suddenly said to D'Arcy, "Why don't you give this 'Charter' to the church? On the one hand, it can avoid disputes, and on the other hand, the church can preach in Persia after obtaining the 'Charter'." D'Arcy did not answer at the time, but before the ship arrived in New York Harbor, he gave this "Charter" to the clergyman and transferred it to the church. This clergyman's name was Sidney Reilly. He was not a missionary clergyman, but an agent sent by the British Admiralty. This "Charter" from Reilly was given to the British Admiralty. The "Charter" that could not be purchased for six million pounds sterling was obtained by an agent of the British Admiralty without spending a penny. In 1914, 56% of the shares of the Anglo-Persian Oil Company were controlled by the British Admiralty. This secret was initially hidden until the outbreak of the war, when it was revealed.</p>
<p>(2) The Crude Oil Dispute between Britain and the United States</p>
<p>Since Britain had obtained the Persian oil fields, it aroused Russia's jealousy. As a result, Persia divided the country's crude oil mines into two zones: the north was given to Russia, and the south was given to Britain. On the British side, they felt quite dissatisfied, so they used spies and various extraordinary methods. Later, all the oil fields in Persia were still completely returned to Britain. The person in charge of this activity was not British, but Dutch. His contribution to Britain was greater than that of the average Englishman. He was a cornerstone in maintaining British interests. This is Henry Deterding, the current general manager of Royal Dutch.</p>
<p>Deterding was originally the manager of a small crude oil company in the Dutch East Indies. In the Dutch East Indies, he met Kessler, the general manager of Royal Dutch at the time. Kessler appreciated him very much. He publicly said to people, "Deterding alone is worth ten billion pounds sterling," so he hired him to work at Royal Dutch. At this time, the company's finances were very difficult. Kessler and Deterding tried to increase capital, but they only raised 500,000 Dutch guilders. In this precarious situation, Royal Dutch obtained many very large crude oil mines. The company's business was booming again. This aroused the jealousy of Rockefeller's Standard Oil Company and began to attack this British-Dutch group. Many shareholders of Royal Dutch agreed to sell the company to the Americans. But Deterding resolutely opposed it. At that time, Kessler, the general manager of Royal Dutch, was critically ill, and he strongly supported Deterding to take his place. The shareholders followed Kessler's wishes and asked Deterding to serve as general manager.</p>
<p>With a capital of 500 Dutch guilders, Deterding declared war on Rockefeller, who had hundreds of millions of assets. Fortunately, he allied with Marcus Samuel, and only then was he able to win the war. Samuel was initially a low-level employee of a shipping company. Later, he saved some capital and bought an old ship. Because the business developed, he increased to twelve new-style ships. He transported goods from the Far East to Europe, but the goods transported back from Europe were very few. Someone suggested that when the ships sailed back from Europe to the Far East, they could conveniently transport Persian crude oil to India. He suddenly felt that transporting crude oil was a very important business. So he allocated a lot of capital to build crude oil ships. He not only engaged in transporting crude oil, but also mined crude oil. Before he joined hands with Deterding, they were actually in a position of mutual competition.</p>
<p>Deterding had abundant crude oil mines, and Samuel had a large number of crude oil transport ships. They decided to unite and form a united front, with one specializing in production and the other specializing in transportation. In 1902, they organized the Asiatic Petroleum Company, specializing in crude oil trade.</p>
<p>Rockefeller's first strategic step was to blockade crude oil ships. He was willing to let empty ships stop sailing rather than transport Royal Dutch's crude oil. Standard Oil had 200,000 kilometers of pipelines in the United States, and the pipeline transportation fee was only one-sixteenth of the railway transportation fee. Therefore, many small crude oil companies in the United States could not compete with Standard Oil. Rockefeller also wanted to use the same method to deal with Royal Dutch, but he already had Samuel's oil tankers to handle transportation for him, so Rockefeller's first plan failed.</p>
<p>Since the transportation blockade policy failed, a price war began. The battlefield this time was in China. China had 400 million people, and Rockefeller considered it his excellent market. He lowered the price of crude oil below cost and sold it in the Chinese market. He distributed 8 million lamps to the Chinese people. But the Chinese people accepted Rockefeller's lamps but used Deterding's crude oil.</p>
<p>Deterding's policy was the same as Rockefeller's. He lowered the price of crude oil to a very low level and sold it in the Chinese market. But because the transportation was closer, the damage was less. Standard Oil's losses in China were offset by raising the selling price in the European and American markets. The increase in the selling price in the European market also benefited Royal Dutch. But Rockefeller's increase in the price of crude oil in the American market caused great resentment among the American people. Therefore, Deterding took advantage of this opportunity to establish a crude oil company with Rockefeller's enemies in Florida, and British crude oil forces penetrated the hinterland of the United States. Now the oil fields in California are also owned by him. Not only does he own a part of the crude oil mines in the United States, but most of the crude oil mines in Central America and South America are also controlled by Deterding.</p>
<p>Most geologists believe that the crude oil mines in Venezuela, South America, are the richest in the world. Here, the struggle for British and American rights is also very sharp. More than ten years ago, the British side instigated their revolution. As a result, Gomey gained power and became the president of Venezuela, while economically, he was completely supplied by Deterding. Venezuela's oil fields were entirely in Deterding's hands. All the crude oil extracted was also transported to Curaçao for refining and then transported for export.</p>
<p>Curaçao is a small island off the coast of Venezuela, a Dutch territory. On this island, there are oil refining facilities and navigation ports. Venezuelan crude oil would lose its function without Curaçao. The residents of the island speak a mixture of English, Portuguese, Spanish, and Dutch. They often clamor for independence because the Americans tell them that if they become independent, Curaçao's tax revenue can be used by themselves and does not have to be sent to the Netherlands. Curaçao has become an important town for British crude oil. Washington and the American oil companies are constantly trying to instigate the people on the island to resist and maintain their independence. This is not for any true meaning, but for crude oil.</p>
<p>Gomey is the current president of Venezuela. He has ruled for fifteen years and is a tyrannical dictator. In Venezuela, many people shout "Long live Gomey!" because Gomey supports them and allows them to live a life of luxury and leisure. Revolutions often occur in Venezuela, and the economic backing for the revolutionaries is Standard Oil.</p>
<p>During the European War, the need for crude oil increased even more. Because the Atlantic Ocean was attacked by submarines, Standard Oil transferred crude oil to the Far Eastern market for sales, especially China. By December 1917, France's crude oil reserves were only 28,000 tons, enough to supply the Allied forces for only two days. In an emergency, Standard Oil's crude oil was transported, allowing the Allied forces to avoid the famine of crude oil. General Ludendorff also said that the victory of the Allied Powers was due to crude oil.</p>
<p>(3) The New Lineup of Soviet Russia's Crude Oil Strategy</p>
<p>Since Britain obtained the Persian crude oil mining rights, the secret struggle between Russia and Britain in Persia has never ceased. Before the European War, the Persian king had ceded the oil fields in the north to Russia, but Britain used various methods to achieve its long-cherished wish of destruction.</p>
<p>Soviet Russia itself originally had very rich oil fields. Before the European War, its crude oil production was almost equal to that of the United States. In the early years after the revolution, production decreased sharply. In 1922, it was 8 million tons; but by 1933, it had increased to 38 million tons. Soviet Russia's crude oil strategy was to unite with the United States to overthrow British forces. The person in charge of this matter was Einhorn, a famous Soviet Russian intelligence operative.</p>
<p>Einhorn and Reza Khan, the current king of Persia, were the two protagonists in overthrowing British forces in Persia. They used Russia's power to obtain independence for Persia from the status of a British protectorate. In 1928, Persia announced that all foreign privileges in Persia were completely abolished. In 1932, Persia abolished the crude oil monopoly. In 1933, Persia and the Anglo-Persian Oil Company signed a new contract to replace the "Charter" obtained by D'Arcy in 1901. In the new contract, Persia did not lease all the oil fields to Britain. The company had to give the government 20% of the profits each year. Moreover, for every ton of crude oil extracted, a tax of 9 was required. Moreover, other minerals were not included in the lease. From then on, D'Arcy's "Charter" became waste paper. Britain's crude oil base and all its forces in Persia were completely lost.</p>
<p>In 1927, Deterding wanted to blockade Soviet Russia's foreign market for crude oil, causing extreme panic in Soviet Russia. So Standard Oil purchased a large amount of Russian oil and sold it at a lower price in the British crude oil market, causing Deterding to suffer huge losses. This competition ended only when Hoover was elected president. Now, Standard Oil and the Soviet Russian side are still cooperating, and Standard Oil's intelligence operatives are also in close contact with the Soviet Russian crude oil operatives.</p>
<p>(4) The Mystery of Harding and Rivera</p>
<p>In 1920, Harding was elected president of the United States with the economic backing of Rockefeller. He was almost a blind tool of Standard Oil, and he agreed to everything that was asked of him. Later, he felt that this puppet was quite improper, and the company's demands were excessive, so Harding gradually changed his attitude. In the early summer of 1923, he openly opposed Standard Oil. In the summer of the same year, he left Washington for summer vacation. Later, news came from Vancouver that President Harding had suddenly died violently. Some said that he was poisoned by insects, some said that he was murdered by a woman, and some had other guesses, but it seems that they forgot that he was very likely to have sacrificed for crude oil.</p>
<p>In 1927, Primo de Rivera was the dictator of Spain. He expelled the Communist Party and revived Spain. He felt that the import of crude oil greatly harmed Spain's interests, so he created a crude oil monopoly system to give part of the profits to the government. This system was of course contrary to the interests of Deterding and Rockefeller. So the two of them joined forces and did not sell oil to Spain. Spain had no choice but to buy the lowest-quality crude oil at the highest price from its enemy, Soviet Russia. At the same time, the British side launched a campaign to not buy Spanish agricultural products, and the American side also increased import taxes on Spanish goods. The situation in Spain became chaotic, and Rivera's government was overthrown. He fled to Paris, but he also died suddenly not long after.</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion</p>
<p>The above is just a few scenes in the global struggle for crude oil. Countries are almost constantly thinking about crude oil. In France, it is now stipulated that crude oil must be mixed with alcohol. In Germany, crude oil is extracted from coal. Now the production of crude oil is still led by the United States, but according to the report of the Geological Survey Division of the US Department of the Interior, the consumption of crude oil in the United States is about twice the total consumption of all other countries in the world. But by 1940, the crude oil reserves in the United States will be exhausted, while the crude oil of other countries can still supply the world for 200 years. But most of the crude oil mines in the world are controlled by Britain. In other words, in five years, the United States will purchase a large amount of crude oil for its consumption from Britain. The United States controls the present of crude oil, and Britain holds the future of crude oil.</p>

<p>Yesterday was Sunday, and the financial market was relatively quiet. The foreign exchange rate was still 23 cents. The turnover of bills traded in the morning market was more than 2.8 million, with more than 300,000 new transactions. The turnover in the afternoon market was more than 400,000, and the turnover in the Small General Assembly was more than 600,000. More than 500,000 foreign exchange mortgages were redeemed. Banks routinely suspended collection and settlement due to the weekend. Money shops collected and settled more than 48 million foreign exchange public orders, more than 400,000 remittances from various routes, and 200,000 cash from inland routes. Auxiliary coins, because cent coins have recently been purchased in large quantities by a certain party, the exchange rate has gradually narrowed. The morning market was 11.5 cents, and the afternoon market was 11.3 cents. Only 5,000 cents of Jiangnan coins were traded in the morning market, and 35,000 cents of Guangdong silver coins were traded in the morning market and 10,000 cents in the afternoon market. Copper coins were 3,000 characters, with a total of 18,000 strings of characters traded, worth 6,000 yuan in foreign exchange. Although there was a rally in the middle, the result was still a drop of 123 yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Securities Last Week Bonds Suddenly Suffered a Setback <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>Though There Were Rallies Midway... The Final Result Was Still a Fall of Two to Three Yuan</p>
<p>Last week, from November 11th to 16th, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Exchange market was turbulent. Just as the currency system reform was flourishing, it suddenly suffered an unexpected blow, and a sharp decline began. This was mainly due to excessive gains, which easily triggered a reaction. Fortunately, most of the bulls were concentrated among large investors, and the shorts took the opportunity to cover their positions, so it did not lead to a market crash. The support from the three banks also provided some strength. The current environment is still unstable. Externally, the relationship between Britain and Italy is worsening, and the domestic situation is extremely complex, which is unlikely to end in the short term. Moreover, the accumulated amount of public bonds is enormous, and the November futures have only a few days left. The environment is precarious, and there will inevitably be another drastic change. Reviewing the past week, the Japanese naval incident in Hongkou occurred on Monday. Although sellers surged, buyers were also strong, and market prices fluctuated constantly. There were both highs and lows, and the bulls tried their best to push up the 96 bonds to mislead the public, which was nothing more than a speculative strategy to cover their positions. On Tuesday, the anniversary of Sun Yat-sen's birth, the market was closed for a day. On Wednesday, rumors spread, and the bulls exited the market. Numbers 47 and 48 were also sold off, leading to a sharp drop of several jiao (tenths of a yuan) to about two yuan. On Thursday, selling pressure was strongest. Numbers 47, 48, 54, and 78 were sold off continuously. The closing price of the Sixth National Loan barely avoided a limit-down by one jiao. On Friday, there were rumors of support from the three banks to maintain the market. Whether this was true could not be verified. Numbers 46 and 78, etc., were indeed bought, but it was unclear whether they were absorbing at low prices under this guise. The shorts could only avoid their sharp edge, and retail investors were exhausted from running around. As a result, market prices reversed direction, with highs and lows varying considerably. On Saturday, the bullish momentum was still strong, with both markets rising nearly three yuan. The closing price only recovered slightly, rising from a few jiao to 1.67 yuan. Currently, the market price differs from the previous week's highest price by no more than four yuan, and the Sixth National Loan differs by less than one yuan, almost reaching the previous high, which is likely unsustainable given the overall environment. In conclusion, the situation is fraught with incidents, and the bond market is still at a high peak. The future is not optimistic. The market price for the week ended with a drop of approximately one yuan to 3.30 yuan. The total transaction volume was 16,800 units, amounting to 145,000 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared and listed below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened with disappointment due to news from Liverpool, long positions were liquidated, and local selling pressure increased. Southern cooperatives engaged in hedging sales, with prices for all months falling by 6 to 10 points. However, after the price drop, it triggered renewed buying from fellow brokers and foreign firms. It was reported that frost had spread from western Texas to the central region, and there was light rain in the eastern region. It was feared that hedging sales would increase next week, and long positions were liquidated. As a result, spot prices fell by 5 points, and futures prices fell by 7 to 11 points. English cotton spot prices fell by 2 points, and futures prices fell by 1 point. Indian cotton weakened due to selling by European exporters, liquidation of long positions, and selling from Upper India. Pingle fell by 2.25 to 2.5 rupees, Olmrah fell by 1.5 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.5 rupees. Originally recorded by telegram (dated 16th).</p>

Yesterday, the No. 2 and No. 3 white lead sheets were also purchased by the Hankou gangs and tea merchant gangs, with the opening price for No. 2 being 30 yuan and No. 3 being 28.5 yuan, an increase of 1 to 1.5 yuan compared to before. It is estimated that more than 60 to 70 barrels were traded. The No. 7 and No. 8 sheets, due to fewer outlets, still opened at a price of 27.5 yuan.

<p>— (Yu Mugu)</p>
<p>All disputes and problems in the world, if based on true justice, will have true right and wrong. No matter how complicated the dispute is, it can be easily resolved. It is just that the powerful do not consider justice themselves, but insist that others follow their inexplicable and incomprehensible barbarous justice. Therefore, true right and wrong are obliterated, and the disturbance becomes even worse.</p>
<p>When beasts fight each other for hunger, at most, both sides will be injured. We criticize them for being cruel, but the cruelty of human beings is a thousand times greater than that of beasts fighting each other. Look at how people usually promote humanitarianism and maintain the peaceful and kind nature of a false mask. However, in the name of maintaining peace and self-defense, they secretly calculate plans to kill and rush to make lethal weapons. When the wild nature erupts one day, they use all possible cruel methods of fighting and killing.</p>
<p>The parties involved, the related parties, the lawyers on both sides, and the judges, when interrogating and debating, the various postures of joy, anger, sorrow, and happiness are faster than the changes of wind and clouds. If you use a fast-motion camera to continuously capture the postures of each person during a single interrogation period, the strange and bizarre appearances will definitely be spectacular and can arouse the endless research interest of philosophers and psychologists.</p>
<h3 id="e186">Concessions <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Yusheng</p>
<p>I once heard a joke. It said that a blind person could judge "Chinese territory" and "foreign territory" based on the feeling of the nerves in the soles of his feet, because the former is mostly gravel roads, uneven in height, while the latter is paved with asphalt roads.</p>
<p>The so-called "foreign territory" refers to the general term for concessions. Shanghainese people use terms such as "Great British Territory" and "French Territory," and they seem to forget the sovereignty of those lands! This should be strictly corrected.</p>
<p>It seems that the term "concession" cannot be found between large and small countries in Europe and the United States, but it is particularly connected with us Chinese. It is signed for ninety-nine years, or even leased indefinitely. It really has the spirit of "growing old together for a hundred years"!</p>
<p>Yokohama, Japan, was once opened as a trading port and established a concession in 1859, but it was immediately taken back after the Meiji Restoration. Their method of abolishing the concession relied entirely on the natural movements of the people. Wherever the areas adjacent to the concession were, the roads were particularly wide, the houses were particularly neat, the transportation was particularly convenient, and public facilities such as electric lights, tap water, parks, museums, libraries, and educational institutions such as kindergartens and schools were all particularly exquisite! Striving for perfection! So that people have no intention of running to the concession! It is said that the relics of this kind of "hard work in construction" and "peaceful struggle" can still be seen very clearly! It is by relying on this spirit of continuous self-improvement that they can get rid of all shackles and progress day by day.</p>
<p>This is a great mirror for us Chinese. Even today, if everyone is still thinking about going to the concession to make foreign money, seek comfort, and indulge in pleasure, without some revitalizing spirit and the concept of becoming strong, then, not to mention that there is no time limit for the current concession to be returned! Even all the land in the country will inevitably have a day when it is "leased" entirely!</p>
<h3 id="e187">Effective Treatment for Jealousy <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Sun Linchang</p>
<p>Jealousy is a characteristic of human beings, especially in women. That's why there is a place name in northern China called "Yidufu Ferry". It is said that in ancient times, there was a Cang Geng who could cure this disease. According to the research results of French medical doctor Fale, this kind of jealousy is caused by a kind of endocrine in the human body. Endocrine is the most magical in the human body. If a person's endocrine has not fully developed, then that person's body must be short and small, because endocrine is the main thing that stimulates human physiology, and it cannot be neglected. Endocrine is particularly developed during adolescence, so jealousy is also the most intense. In recent times, young men and women are caught up in love triangles and create waves in the sea of vinegar, which is unmanageable; according to Lei Shi, "it is all caused by jealousy." Now, based on the above principles, Lei Shi has invented a special medicine that shrinks the endocrine. Once injected, the excitement of the endocrine will decline, and the heart of jealousy will also disappear. It is said that in France, there are many young couples who were suspicious of each other at first and had affairs, which were about to lead to divorce. Since being treated by Lei Shi, the relationship between husband and wife has been as harmonious as ever.</p>

<p>Chapter Twenty-One Gently Relies on People Over the Courtyard to Pity the Moon's Appearance and Arouse the Husband to Listen to the Lion's Voice from the Room</p>
<p>Jia Duocai smiled at this time and said to Mrs. Zhou, since Mrs. Zhou came out to speak, I will forgive him this time. It's not that I treat him cruelly, but because of his background, I want to train him to become a person. As he spoke, he pinched a corner of Yueying's sleeve with two fingers, glared his eyes, and said: Now you can go in, right? Yueying wailed, as if she was about to cry, and Bei Hai stood far away, and couldn't help being taken aback. If Jia Duocai really asked about the reason, don't involve the bystanders. But he was a little worried about this kind of thinking. Yueying held her mouth with both hands again, coughed randomly with her head down for a while, and then took the fork and walked into the house. Bei Hai only felt a ball of anger in his heart, which was about to be spit out of his mouth. If he was not afraid of the law, he would definitely rush forward and slap Jia Duocai twice. It's just that Yueying went into the house. Jia Duocai also followed into the house, and he couldn't chase him to the door of his house, so he couldn't help stomping his feet twice, and then turned around and walked slowly towards Cheng Zhiqian's house. Zhiqian stood with his hands behind his back, leaning against the door of the room, looking at the sky, a little lost in thought, not knowing what interesting question he was studying, and occasionally lowered his head to look forward, seeing Bei Hai's face was purple and black, clearly hiding a lot of anger in his heart, so he smiled and said in a gentle tone: Bei Hai, you finished your homework very early today! Hokkaido: Mr. Cheng, I am going to lean to the left. In this society, there is no way without going to extremes. As he spoke, he stretched out his palm with his left hand and squeezed a big fist with his right hand, hammered it in his palm, and stomped his feet heavily twice while gritting his teeth. (362)</p>

<p>I naturally can't guess this; but in the evening, I got a factual proof, because he suddenly summoned me to his close quarters, held my hands, and stroked them lovingly. This move was only when I first entered the palace, because he thought I was born with a bit of foreign air, and he was not happy, so he stroked my hands once like this.</p>
<p>"How soft and tender this is! Only young people have such a pair of hands!" As he stroked, he sighed: "Who doesn't like to have such a pair of hands? But people like us who bear the responsibility of ruling hundreds of millions of people must have an experienced and restrained old hand!"</p>
<p>"Yes! Sixth Queen." I really couldn't think of anything appropriate to say to this old lady who was so burdened and suddenly looked haggard. He suddenly raised his eyes and stared at me.</p>
<p>"Ah! Youth!" He said very gently: "This is the most precious gift that nature bestows on people, so people must try their best to cherish it and try to save it; even when they are old, they must do so!" (458)</p>

<p>— Chen Xiaodie</p>
<p>Chen Xiaodie, a member of the Yellow Mountain Construction Committee, recently traveled to Yellow Mountain with Zhou Shoujuan, a reporter from Shenbao, and traveled all over the wonders, with unrestrained feelings on the clouds. Mr. Zhou never writes poetry, but this time he accompanied the Sheng Tour and made as many as fifty-two poems. His fellow travelers, Tu Xiaochao and his son Dingyuan, took eight hundred pages of photos, which can be said to be lavish! Mr. Chen has made many suggestions on the construction of Yellow Mountain scenic spots. He has drafted an article on Yellow Mountain Improvised, which has been sent to Mr. Xu Shiying of the Yellow Mountain Construction Association for consideration and implementation. Mr. Chen is known as a three-piece suit of poetry, calligraphy, and painting. He has obtained many Yellow Mountain paintings on this trip. It is heard that he will complete fifty paintings within two months and hold an exhibition. All the proceeds from the sale of the paintings will be allocated to disaster relief and to help the construction of Yellow Mountain. The original text of his Yellow Mountain Improvised is recorded as left: Yellow Mountain Kesh</p>
<p>Yellow Mountain is dangerous, and the pine wind and clouds are especially called three wonders. The more dangerous it is, the more strange it is, and the more strange it is, the more dangerous it is. Tiandu Peak is 8,000 feet high, and the West Sea Gate is cracked by thousands of feet, and its bottom cannot be seen. Since ancient times, no adventurer has dared to try it, and the mountain monks have many myths. Today, Tiandu has been excavated by Wu Zhilao. However, there are still no steps at the top, only holes are dug in the stone walls to accommodate the toes, and the toes are used to climb up, which is quite like a gecko. Or it is said that traveling in the mountains must be adventurous, not dangerous or strange. I think this is what the winner said. Han Tuizhi drove crocodiles and said that Zhu Xi was not afraid, and when he climbed Mount Hua, he wailed and the ladder was taken down. How could the height of a ladder be wrapped up; it is true that the body, hair, and skin are received from the parents, and people are born to us, and there are still useful ones, and it is okay to travel in the mountains to enjoy the scenery and take risks. Why do you fight for your life? I once ventured into the heavy fog and climbed to the Manjushri Temple at night. Zhang Wenbai thought it was dangerous, and Xu Jinglao left people to look for me everywhere. At that time, I thought it was heroic, but after thinking about it, I felt a little reckless. Therefore, my poem says: It is okay to take risks, why do you fight for your life? The poem is very long. Jing Lao said: Reading your poem, it can be said that a blind man is riding a blind horse and facing a deep pool in the middle of the night, which makes people feel lingering fear. Therefore, I re-entered Yellow Mountain, but I didn't dare to play again. For example, at the top of Tiandu, it is appropriate to add iron chains so that the weak can climb and explore the victory.</p>
<p>Traveling in the mountains and leaving behind the joy must be done in three things, poetry, painting, and photography. However, Yellow Mountain is wide and large, and photographers can only take one corner of it. Once encountering clouds and fog, it is even more difficult to do. If the pine on the top of Tiandu and the stone on the top of the stone bamboo cylinder are ever-changing and take shape according to their types, they will make photographers sigh and have nowhere to place them. At this time, only painting and poetry can take one in ten thousand, but the pockets that are carried are often lacking in paper and pen. Borrowing from the monastery is also only a broken paper and a broken reed, which is not suitable for sending joy, and the good environment is fleeting, making people regret it for many days when they think about it. It is appropriate to ask the understanding monks to prepare good paper and pens, so that travelers can have the joy of writing and the mountain temple can have the wealth of collection. Every spring and autumn, regular exhibitions are held, and many appraisers are hired to determine their abandonment. Then, the famous mountain will have a work that must be passed down, and there will be no hate for the unworthy to be hidden. Inscriptions and stone carvings are beautiful, which makes the famous mountain more beautiful, and the inferior ones really call for injustice for the mountain spirit. Yellow Mountain has not been developed for a long time, and there are fewer stone carvings, but good people cannot avoid vulgarity, so the Hunlun vitality is gradually being cut down. Although the management bureau has recently issued a warning, the monks in the temple cannot prohibit the Hai Ke, and it is useless to form a written document. I think that tourists may as well write on paper and send them to the Yellow Mountain Construction Committee first. The committee will designate experts to specialize in evaluation. The good ones will be inscribed on stone, and the bad ones will be discarded. All stonemasons must be hired by the committee, and a special clause must be set, and then the destruction can be avoided, and every word will be glorious. As for the name book of the mountain temple, it should be made of Xuan paper, and the size should be the same for each temple. Or it can be taken back by the management bureau, added a tidying up, and taken the good ones to be framed into a book, which is still treasured by the temple monks. When the mountain house has guests, there is also a lot of fun to exhibit.</p>
<p>In recent years, those who travel to Yellow Mountain have mostly taken the route of Tangkou, up to Wenshu, staying at Shilin, then staying at Songgu, and out of Kuzhuxi to complete the victory tour. Those who are weaker mostly go to Wenshu Temple and stop because of the difficulty. It is estimated that the reason is that although it is only eight kilometers (about eighteen miles) from Jushilin to Wenshu Temple, it is not easy to climb the mountain with your face up, and it is only possible to walk with caution on the slope, and those who enter the mountain for the first time are afraid of climbing. Those who are brave climb the steps, but they can't help but gasp for breath. When you get to Wenshu, look left at Tiandu and right at Lotus, all of which are steep steps of thousands of steps, like people spreading their arms in the clouds, and the place where you stand is only a skull, then no one will lose color and be afraid to retreat. It can be seen that in the eight kilometers from Jushilin to Wenshu Temple, there is still Banshan Temple for rest, and from Wenshu Temple to Lianhua Gully, climb Lianhua Peak, go down Baibu Cloud Ladder, out of Aoyu Cave, cross Tianhai and go to Lion Forest, up and down thousands of steps, there is no place to sit and rest in the middle, which is a big regret for mountain travel. Therefore, I think that Banshan Temple can be used for accommodation, and Tianhai must have at least a thatched cottage to accommodate breathing, so that it can slightly restore its strength and enjoy the victories of Pingtian East Gate, otherwise, no one will miss it.</p>
<p>The strange pines of Yellow Mountain are everywhere, but those that have been marked by the ancients, due to the vastness of the sky and the wind, have mostly withered in the past hundred years. It is impossible to replant them, but it seems that it is possible to continue the name, or it may be disliked to take this name and the other, and there is no borrowing, then it is better to choose a new name and call this ancient tree, so that tourists will have more fun pointing it out. As for the old harmonious pines, there is also a pine with several names, and the chaos is not a big problem.</p>

<h3 id="e193">Introducing the Japanese Trachoma Prevention Association (Continued) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Ren</p>
<p>1.  Publication of Association Magazine: Initially four times a year, later (1924) changed to twice a year, with 54 issues published to date.  It disseminates essential information on trachoma prevention, achievements in prevention, and association affairs to the public.</p>
<p>2.  Holding of Training Seminars: Training seminars are divided into two categories: one for general physicians, to impart trachoma prevention methods, diagnostics, therapeutics, and surgical practice; the other is popular trachoma seminars for the general public, such as schools and hospitality workers, to impart trachoma knowledge for prevention. Each training seminar is organized by local medical associations, other academic societies, or the association itself, with lecturers dispatched by the association to ensure the uniformity of prevention efforts.</p>
<p>3.  Publication of "Essentials of Popular Trachoma Knowledge": Tens of thousands of copies are distributed to the public during lectures.  "Trachoma Diagnosis, Treatment, Prevention, and Lecture Materials" are also compiled as a reference for general physicians.</p>
<p>4.  Utilization of Various Exhibitions: Displaying real objects, wax models of trachoma patients' faces, six types of wax models of trachoma enlarged two times, and other charts related to trachoma transmission and prevention for widespread publicity.</p>
<p>5.  Establishment of Free Clinics:  Physicians from the association preside over free examinations and treatment for people of all social classes.</p>
<p>6.  Production of Trachoma Slide Shows: Despite financial difficulties, the association managed to overcome all obstacles and complete four reels of film, over 3,800 feet in length, about trachoma. It has received high praise from society and recommendations from authorities.</p>
<p>7.  Suggestions and Petitions to the Government: As a private group, the association's power is inherently limited. Therefore, prompting government attention and implementing effective trachoma prevention policies are major missions of the association.</p>
<p>(4) Achievements of Japan's Trachoma Prevention Efforts: A brief overview of the achievements of Japan's trachoma prevention efforts is as follows:</p>
<p>1.  Mass Screening to Obtain Trachoma Distribution Information: The method is as follows:</p>
<p>A. Complete Examination of All Residents Within a Specific Area: This is unique in the world and amazes all countries.</p>
<p>B. Examination of Various Occupational Groups: Such as nursing staff, barbers, hotel and restaurant staff, etc.</p>
<p>D. Students of All Schools: Including all male and female schools, from elementary to university.</p>
<p>E. Annual Conscription Examinations: Japan implements universal conscription. Every year, draftees are around twenty years old. Great attention is paid to trachoma screening. According to a private report by Professor Ishihara of the Imperial University's ophthalmology department, the statistical report of Japanese conscription examinations is the most accurate and reliable of all Japanese statistical reports because the examiners are all ophthalmology experts.</p>
<p>2.  Treatment Facilities and Expenses: Public treatment centers treat an average of 452,000 trachoma patients annually. In addition, there are prefectural treatment centers, privately established clinics, and mobile treatment teams everywhere, giving patients the opportunity to receive treatment, which makes the eradication of trachoma possible.</p>
<p>As for expenses:</p>
<p>Average annual expenses for municipal public clinics: 262,059 yen (an average of 0.60 yen per patient).</p>
<p>Annual average cost of treatment teams in remote areas: approximately 6,192 yen.</p>
<p>Annual average cost of prefectural clinics: 4,726 yen.</p>
<p>Annual average cost of private clinics: 13,088 yen.</p>
<p>Total: 286,065 yen.</p>
<p>3.  Results of Prevention Efforts: Here is a report on the trachoma statistics from the Army Ministry's conscription examinations, which are considered precise and reliable:</p>
<p>The trachoma prevalence rate among young men during conscription examinations is as follows:</p>
<p>Taisho Year 1 (1912): 24.0%</p>
<p>Year 4 (1915): 18.0%</p>
<p>Year 7 (1918): 15.3%</p>
<p>Year 10 (1921): 13.9%</p>
<p>Year 13 (1924): 14.5%</p>
<p>Showa Year 2 (1927): 12.7%</p>
<p>Year 5 (1930): 11.1%</p>
<p>Year 8 (1933): 9.6%</p>
<p>It can be seen that trachoma among Japanese youth is decreasing year by year. The achievements of Japan's prevention efforts are generally evident from this. The annual expenditure of about half a million yen is not wasted.</p>
<p>(5) Conclusion:</p>
<p>Having finished my introduction to the Japanese Trachoma Prevention Association, I can't help but feel endless sighs. Japan is a country of the same script and race as us, and in the past, it suffered the exploitation of the great powers along with us. But now, in less than a century, its national power has grown stronger day by day, while our national power has weakened. Japan's restoration was a unified effort, moving forward towards a single ideal. What is this ideal? "To emulate advanced countries and build a modern nation." Today's Japan is the beginning of this ideal. May the people of our country take heed.</p>

<p>Tuberculosis Prevention Guidelines for School Children</p>
<p>The most important aspect of tuberculosis prevention for children is early diagnosis. Children with tuberculosis or suspected of having tuberculosis should be isolated and sent to sanatoriums for treatment. However, it is very difficult to examine children for tuberculosis, and even school doctors cannot do it. Ideally, the tuberculin test is the most appropriate, but if this method cannot be implemented, children with the following conditions should be given special attention by the clinic.</p>
<p>(1) Children with a family history of tuberculosis, especially if their parents, siblings, or sisters had tuberculosis at the time of the child's birth, or died from it.</p>
<p>(2) Children who have tuberculosis in their direct environment.</p>
<p>(3) Children who are very weak and have poor physical development.</p>
<p>(4) Children with lymphatic gland diseases.</p>
<p>(5) Children who are frequently infected with [illegible character] and often drop out of school due to inflammation.</p>
<p>(6) Children with poor appetite.</p>
<p>(7) The recovery period after infectious diseases, especially measles, pertussis, and acute colds.</p>
<p>(8) Children who cough and have fever frequently.</p>
<p>(9) Students or teachers who are found to have open tuberculosis in school. All students in the class or school should be examined.</p>
<p>Tuberculosis Mortality Statistics in Germany in 1931</p>
<p>Compared with the statistics from 1913 to 1928, the tuberculosis mortality statistics in Prussia in 1931 decreased by almost one-third. However, the decrease was not significant in young children aged 2 to 5 and adults aged 25 to 30. School children and those aged 40 to 70 were statistically safer. However, the mortality rate of tuberculosis was extremely high during working ages. The mortality rate among married women did not increase statistically.</p>
<p>Decrease in Tuberculosis Mortality Statistics in the United States</p>
<p>According to Dr. Kellogg's report, the tuberculosis mortality statistics in the United States of America were 204 per 100,000 people in 1904 and only 67 in 1931. This decrease in tuberculosis mortality statistics also has the same tendency in colored people. The reason is that the definite pathological cause has been proven, and especially the progress of surgical methods, the completeness of sanatorium equipment, and the progress of public health. In recent years, the number of tuberculosis deaths has further decreased. For example, in the ten states of the United States, the statistics from January to June 1932 decreased by 8% compared with the same months of the previous year.</p>
<p>Annual Losses Due to Tuberculosis Deaths in France</p>
<p>The annual mortality statistics in France are 690,000 cases, of which 90,000 are due to tuberculosis. Roughly speaking, men account for about 50,000, and women account for about 40,000. The mortality rate of young children under the age of ten has now decreased, but between the ages of ten and twenty, the mortality statistics of both sexes have gradually increased. Afterwards, women gradually decreased to the age of forty, and men decreased to the age of fifty. In France, approximately 300,000 people of working age between the ages of fifteen and fifty-five die from tuberculosis each year, and the impact on the country's productivity is 1.1 billion francs, not to mention the cost of treatment and the subsidies for the families of the deceased. Therefore, the loss is at least 1.5 billion francs per year.</p>
<p>Current Status of Tuberculosis in Norway</p>
<p>52% of Norwegian residents have a positive tuberculin reaction, of which 0.9% are infants under two years old, and 10.99% are children under eighteen years old. All patients with open tuberculosis are called sources of infection (97%), and the patient's residence is called the area of infection (84%). Two-thirds of tuberculosis deaths are caused by infections in their own homes, mostly due to droplet infection. The clinical manifestations of tuberculosis are most likely to occur between the ages of thirteen and thirty, and three-quarters of pleurisy patients mostly occur within three years after infection. Bacterial immunization has a considerable resistance to allergic reactions, but it is ineffective for endogenous disseminated tuberculosis, and congenital resistance is very important. From experience, the only effective way to prevent tuberculosis infection is to isolate the cause of the disease.</p>
<p>Alcohol and Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Observations on the medical records of 1,742 children revealed that the families of more than 50% of children with surgical tuberculosis were drinkers. Since the implementation of prohibition regulations in the Netherlands in 1916, the mortality rate of tuberculosis, especially among elderly male tuberculosis patients, has decreased significantly.</p>
<p>Italian Tuberculosis Prevention Organization</p>
<p>Recently, Italian scholar Molaini published Italy's organization and achievements in tuberculosis prevention at the National Science Conference. Molaini is the dean of the new Carlo Forlani Sanatorium, secretary general of the Italian National Medical Association, and vice president of the National Tuberculosis Prevention Association. His position is extremely important. He said,</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>that since Italy implemented the compulsory insurance law for tuberculosis, the annual tuberculosis mortality statistics have decreased from 50,000 to 40,000 people. Tuberculosis patients should leave their families, and children in the tuberculosis environment are even more important. The important implementation of tuberculosis prevention methods is the compulsory insurance for tuberculosis. All salary levels below 100 Lira per month (1 Lira is equal to 0.20 Chinese yuan) must comply with the tuberculosis insurance law. In addition, the Fascist National Research Institute spares no effort to improve public health and treatment methods. For example, initially tuberculosis patients were only instructed to pay attention to family treatment methods, but now, due to the establishment of a large number of sanatoriums and treatment centers, irregular family treatment methods have been completely abandoned. Molaini believes that sanatoriums should be built on high mountains, and the number of beds should continue to increase. This decrease in tuberculosis mortality statistics is of course not entirely due to direct tuberculosis prevention work, but also due to the improvement of public health. Finally, Molaini also said that physicians who are engaged in tuberculosis prevention work must undergo specialized training, and this kind of work belongs to the country, which will definitely increase the effectiveness of tuberculosis prevention.

<h3 id="e195">Study on Inoculation (Part 1) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>—Thirteenth Story of Medical Anecdotes—</p>
<p>Anyone familiar with the history of inoculation knows the name Edward Jenner. In medical history, Jenner is revered as the originator of vaccination, and he has always enjoyed the honor of a general medical inventor. In fact, Jenner's honor is somewhat undeserved. What Jenner introduced was the technique of inoculating cowpox to prevent smallpox, but before that, the technique of using human smallpox pus to inoculate the body—the so-called "planting flowers"—had already become popular in Europe. The first person to introduce "planting flowers" to Europe was Lady Mary Wortley Montagu, and its origin was in Turkey.</p>
<p>Lady Montagu was the wife of the British ambassador to Turkey at the time. On April 1, 1717, this ambassador's wife wrote in a letter to a lady in her home country:</p>
<p>"I want to tell you something that I believe will make you want to live here. Smallpox, which is very common and life-threatening in our country, has become completely harmless here due to the invention of Ingrafting. Here, a group of old women make it their specialty to perform this kind of surgery every year in September, when the severe heat has subsided. People ask each other whether their family members are willing to get smallpox once. These people gather together (usually about fifteen or sixteen people), and the old woman comes over, carrying a nutshell of 'top-quality' smallpox pus, and asks you which vein you want her to cut open. You tell her, and she immediately cuts open the skin of that part with a large needle, which will make you feel as if you have been scratched. Then, she puts the smallpox pus from the needle tip into your vein. You will probably start to have a fever on the eighth day. Within a few days, smallpox will appear on your face—no more than twenty or thirty pustules at most. The French ambassador here once joked that the Turks 'eat smallpox' just like other people drink water."</p>
<p>In the half-century after this, there were many famous representatives of the implementation of "planting flowers." Dr. Maitland was Lady Montagu's first British disciple. Princess Caroline persuaded George I to pardon six convicted criminals and have them undergo "planting flowers" as an experiment. Dr. Maitland performed "planting flowers" on these six criminals in 1721. As a result, they all developed mild smallpox and were spared hanging.</p>
<p>In France, King Louis XVI underwent "planting flowers" in 1774. The bold attempt of the royal family was seen as a grand ceremony at the time. Queen's dressmaker Madame Rose Bertin specially created a special headdress in the shape of a smallpox pustule to commemorate this grand ceremony.</p>
<p>In the eighteenth century, the most famous person to perform "planting flowers" was Baron Dimsdale, who was invited by the Russian Queen Catherine II to Russia to perform "planting flowers." At that time, the Russian people not only dared not try "planting flowers," but also regarded Baron Dimsdale as a demon. As soon as they saw him arrive, they ran away. The king specially sent a guard to accompany him to a family to inoculate. The distressed mother curled up in the corner of the house, trying to hide her youngest three-year-old boy. To promote the technique, the King personally underwent the experiment, as did her lover Grigory Orlov and her adopted son Grand Duke Paul. The results of these three were very good, and the trend of planting flowers gradually became popular in the royal family and among the people, and the doctors of St. Petersburg began to learn this surgery.</p>
<h3 id="e196">Talking About My Own Blistering Method for Quitting Smoking <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Song Guobin</p>
<p>Origin: My trial use of this method was long before the 8th Far East Tropical Medicine Association. Six years ago, I accidentally read a French magazine and saw an article on using blistering to quit drinking. I was fascinated by it, so I tried using it to quit smoking, and it had a remarkable effect. Later, I taught this method to my classmates at the Aurora University School of Medicine and asked them to practice it in the hospital. As my classmates gradually graduated and spread out in all directions, this method was passed on and gradually became known to the Chinese people. Recently, various drug rehabilitation centers in Shanghai and the entire Longhai Railway have used this method as the only way to quit smoking. The number of smokers who have quit is in the millions. The Ti Ren Hospital, which I and Dr. Yang Yannian run, has used this method to help thousands of people quit smoking over the years, and the results are very impressive. Compared to the tapering method, it is indeed faster and less painful! This method initially used a mixture of ammonia and camphor oil to cause blistering, and those who quit often felt pain. Since switching to domestic cantharidin ointment, there has been no pain at all. Now, because inquiries have been pouring in from all directions, I am writing this to answer them:</p>
<p>Principle: Opium is one of the toxins. Non-addicts who smoke it will be poisoned if they take a slight overdose. Addicts who smoke it will not be harmed even if they take a large dose. Why is this? It is because the human body cannot tolerate foreign substances. When toxins invade, it produces an antitoxin to eliminate them. The same is true for the inhalation of opium. Addicts develop "anti-opium toxins" in their bodies, which neutralize the inhaled opium and create a need. Therefore, the inhaled smoke is eliminated by them, and if they do not smoke for a while, they feel the need. This is why addicts rarely experience poisoning. The fundamental method of quitting smoking is to eliminate these "anti-opium toxins" and restore the body to its pre-addiction state, so that it cannot feel the inhalation of opium, and at the same time, the body has no need for opium. The principle of blistering to quit smoking lies in this. The blister fluid contains this toxin, but once it is extracted and comes into contact with the outside world, it undergoes physical and chemical changes and becomes a special type of allogeneic protein. If this is then injected back into the body of the person trying to quit, it disrupts the blood and throws it off its normal equilibrium state. The "anti-opium toxins" in the body are also precipitated and lose their effect in this chaotic state. This is the so-called "shock" phenomenon. Therefore, after a certain period of time after the injection, those trying to quit not only have no need for opium, but also experience nausea, vomiting, and all kinds of unpleasant allergic reactions if they try to smoke. This is a popular explanation of the principle of blistering to quit smoking.</p>
<p>Precautions for Use: Blistering surgery is well known to doctors and does not need to be described in detail. However, one point that needs to be noted is that the speed of effectiveness is related to the amount of blister fluid. If the amount of fluid produced at one time is more than 10 cc, the effect will be very fast. Otherwise, it must be continued. The amount of blister fluid depends on the thickness of the skin. If the skin is thick, blistering is more difficult and there is less blister fluid. If the skin is tender, blistering is very easy. Do not damage it. Therefore, the length of time for applying the blister varies from person to person. After several experiences, doctors will naturally know this.</p>
<p>Before using this method, those trying to quit may as well smoke opium to their heart's content. They may also smoke after the injection until an allergic reaction occurs, and then the need for opium will disappear.</p>
<p>After blistering, those trying to quit should lie still to avoid damaging the blisters due to movement.</p>
<p>Effect: The effect of the blistering method is not only to quit opium, but also to quit red pills, white powder, morphine, cocaine, and other addictions. According to Dr. Yang Yannian's report, its effectiveness is even faster and more effective than quitting opium.</p>
<p>Smokers who quit using this method not only lose the need for opium, but also develop a kind of aversion to their usual paper cigarettes and alcohol.</p>
<p>However, this aversion is temporary. In other words, the "allergic reaction" disappears after a certain period of time, so there is the possibility of relapse. I have personally seen several people who are weak-willed and come because they are forced by their environment. After quitting, they see that both time and money are saved, and they have no mental or physical pain, so they think about smoking again. When the environment changes, they really re-enter the black list. So they quit and then smoke again, smoke and then quit again, and the cycle continues, repeating as usual. Some people say that this method is too painless and safe, which makes those trying to quit more likely to try it. Is this true? How can it be? This shows that there is a perfect method in the world, but there are also bad people. This is what we hope for the strict enforcement of the smoking ban.</p>
<p>Blistering to quit smoking is very effective, but according to Dr. Yang Yannian's report, it is more difficult to achieve results with smokers who swallow raw opium. Opium contains various toxins, and the degree of poisoning from swallowing it is deeper than from smoking it. In addition, Lin Wenxhong's plaster, which is a variation of raw opium, is also difficult to quit after prolonged use.</p>
<p>Conclusion: In general, when a method is invented, the social criticism is mixed. Some people believe in it, some people oppose it, and some people deliberately slander it. Blistering to quit smoking is the same. I saw in the Kang Le Special Edition of Shen Bao that Mr. Wang Dun'gen's article "Painless Quitting of Smoking" spared no effort to criticize blistering to quit smoking. This really confuses the public and terrifies smokers. Dun'gen's intention was to promote a certain industrial society's egg yolk albumin. I do not want to comment on whether egg yolk albumin is effective, but I cannot correct the inaccuracies in Wang's words! Blistering to quit smoking is the least painful of all quitting methods. In addition to short-term insomnia and leg soreness, there are very few other symptoms. The Black Sea is equal to hell. Leaving the Black Sea is like ascending to heaven from hell. If you cannot even endure these slight aches and pains, how can you be determined to quit?</p>

<p>(70) Stomatitis (Continued)</p>
<p>(6th) Suppurative Stomatitis</p>
<p>Suppurative stomatitis mostly occurs on the tongue and the floor of the mouth. Therefore, in clinical practice, it can be divided into two types: substantive glossitis and Ludwig's angina. Now, I will talk about them separately.</p>
<p>(A) Substantive Glossitis: This disease in Japan is often caused by insect stings or other minor injuries. However, it can also occur without any cause. Its main symptom is that the patient's tongue is particularly swollen, making it difficult to contain in the mouth. It often protrudes outside the teeth or presses on the throat, causing difficulty breathing. The patient also often feels inconvenienced during talking, chewing, and swallowing. Sometimes, there are also systemic symptoms.</p>
<p>(B) Ludwig's Angina: This disease is actually acute cellulitis of the floor of the mouth. It is generally caused by pyogenic cocci. The source of the inflammation is often in the submandibular gland. This disease has primary and secondary types. However, in clinical practice, it is mostly secondary to diphtheria, scarlet fever, typhoid fever, and influenza. Its main symptoms are redness, swelling, and pain on the skin between the mandibular ramus and the hyoid bone. The floor of the mouth then quickly rises up, and the tongue presses tightly against the palate. Therefore, difficulty can occur during talking, chewing, and swallowing, or it may even be completely impossible. If the disease is severe, it can compress the throat, jugular vein, and esophagus, causing various dangerous symptoms.</p>
<p>This disease mostly develops into an abscess that ruptures outwards or into the oral cavity. It rarely stops the disease process and heals through absorption. Therefore, its prognosis is generally unfavorable. The mortality rate is about 50%. As for its treatment plan, anti-inflammatory methods should be used first. If an abscess has formed, drainage should be performed as soon as possible. This is the key. (End of Stomatitis)</p>

<p>This book is written by Doctor Guo Renji, clarifying the true nature of consumption (including pulmonary tuberculosis, bone tuberculosis, scrofula, and all kinds of consumption), in intricate detail, and indicating how to prevent and fight consumption, as well as how to conquer the disease of consumption. It is both elegant and popular, can be spoken and acted upon. It is no exaggeration to say that those who suffer from consumption can be taught by reading this book thoroughly. Its contents have been seen scattered in various medical and pharmaceutical supplements, and have long been desired by the general public. It has now been published in a thick hardcover volume, and includes various lung tuberculosis X-ray photographs, copperplates, zinc plates, and many other illustrations. The price is 6 jiao per volume, and an additional 1 jiao 3 fen for postage for out-of-town mail orders. Stamps are accepted at a 10% discount. It is sold at Guo's Social Hygiene Series Editorial Department, No. 40 Yuelai Fang, Caishi Road, French Concession, Shanghai.</p>

<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Lastly, the author has one more thing to declare, which is: the so-called strong will is specifically aimed at the patient's overthinking and anxiety, prescribing the right medicine for the symptom: the indirect purpose is to hope that the patient's body and mind are simultaneously at peace, which will help with other treatments. It is not to say that humans can definitely conquer nature, and that all changes in the condition can be disregarded; that air, nutrition, and various other treatments are superfluous. The extreme of this kind of malpractice is much greater than the former; I hope patients with this disease will understand this clearly.</p>
<p>Section Four: Light Therapy</p>
<p>This is a relatively common treatment method; among them, of course, the most well-known is natural sunlight—it is essential for everyone, and its radiation is undoubtedly beneficial to the human body; the term "sunbathing" has recently been welcomed by the general public. There are also many who advocate the use of sunlight therapy for pulmonary tuberculosis. They believe that patients exposed to sunlight can easily develop skin pigmentation through the power of ultraviolet radiation, resulting in a beneficial impact on the general symptoms of the disease. However, another group of doctors are very skeptical. Because prolonged exposure to sunlight can easily cause bleeding and pleurisy, and many cases of the disease, where the lesions have stopped changing, are rekindled as a result. If you are exposed to sunlight without taking off your clothes, it is easy to cause a state of congestion. Therefore, doctors should be very careful about sunlight therapy; whether it is suitable for the patient, and the determination of the exposure time, are particularly important.</p>
<p>Under what kind of tuberculosis condition is light therapy most suitable? Usually, tuberculosis abscesses, bone tuberculosis, etc., so-called surgical tuberculosis, are mostly suitable. On the pulmonary tuberculosis side, conditions like exudative, early infiltration, cavities, and those with a tendency to cough up blood and pleurisy, should all be avoided. In addition, the hyperplastic sclerotic type can be adopted. Regarding the procedure for exposure, start with the feet, and gradually rise to the head. The head is absolutely unsuitable. The maximum time is thirty minutes at the back; if it is too long, it is extremely easy to cause vomiting and various nervous conditions. Children are sometimes prone to tracheobronchitis, so be careful.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Believing Rumors <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Ji</p>
<p>Recently, there have been many rumors in this city, so the people who are moving are very active, especially in Zhabei. If you ask how it is not good? Then they say the news is bad, the situation is unstable, and there will be war again. And if you ask who they are fighting with, naturally they will say they are fighting with a certain country.</p>
<p>Is there really going to be war? Is there a possibility of war? Our people have no common sense judgment on this kind of thing, and they most like to listen to rumors, which is extremely pitiful. If you don't believe it, please see that the municipal government has repeatedly denied the rumors and prohibited residents from moving and students from skipping classes, hoping that citizens will use common sense to judge rumors and observe the situation calmly. Also, Mr. He Yingqin, the Minister of Military Administration of our country, said that the central government's policy towards Japan remains unchanged. Anyone with a calm mind and abundant common sense will not be fooled by the rumor-mongers. Although the credibility of newspapers has gone bankrupt, are the municipal government's clear announcements and the Minister of Military Administration's earnest talks also false?</p>
<p>But there are some people who think that what is said in the newspapers is not credible, the municipal government's documents are not credible, and the Minister of Military Administration's talks are not credible, but they only like to listen to a bunch of unfounded rumors, empty words, as if they have evidence and cannot but believe them. What kind of mentality is this? When one family moves, all families follow. When one person spreads the word, everyone agrees. When family A moves, family B will say that family A has moved, and a great disaster is bound to happen, and I cannot but move. When family B moves, families C, D, and others are greatly shocked and say, "Families A and B have moved, and the news must be bad, and we cannot but move." But they don't ask what the facts are. As a result, ordinary people disturb themselves and suffer a loss for nothing.</p>
<p>Investigating the cause of the spread of these rumors, there must be a considerable reason: (1) The market has been sluggish recently, and a group of rogues like to cause trouble so that they can take advantage of the situation and rob. (2) Zhabei suffered very heavy losses since the January 28th Incident and is now a frightened bird. (3) The citizens lack common sense, and once a rumor spreads, they believe it is true, as if disaster is coming. It can be seen from this that the Chinese people do not value reality but only believe in empty words. Therefore, when they hear talk about gods and ghosts, they think about going to sea to seek immortality. When they read martial arts books, they want to go to the mountains to seek Taoism. The Chinese people generally lack scientific common sense and the ability to judge, and they disturb themselves for no reason.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Rubber Plantation <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Conglong</p>
<p>I remember that as soon as I stepped out of the door of the elementary school, I always liked to run to my father's rubber plantation, sitting alone under the rubber trees, quietly listening to the gentle warm wind of the southern country whistling a slight whistle, watching the golden dust-like sunlight flickering and tossing on the rubber tree leaves. What made my young mind most happy was Lao Yu, who managed the rubber plantation, who would often give me some delicious food and the bananas that he had planted at the end of the garden himself. Every time he gave me something, his face was always smiling, his mouth cracked open, revealing two rows of black teeth, and he would say, "Fourth Young Master, try it, -- hee hee, it's nothing" -- or "These bananas were just cut from behind the garden, and the taste is not bad."</p>
<p>At the same time, I also liked the cleanliness, neatness, and order of the rubber plantation. Under the rubber trees, it was so neat that almost not even a single weed was allowed to grow, presenting a flat expanse of red. Every day, Lao Yu was always busy wandering around, supervising the workers to pull out the weeds under the trees, with sweat streaming down his back. Sometimes, I really couldn't bear it for him and asked, "Why do you have to pull out the weeds under the trees, Lao Yu?" He quickly turned his head, put on a smiling face, and replied very sincerely: "Fourth Young Master, weeds will take away the fertilizer from the rubber trees, so that the rubber trees cannot grow quickly and produce more rubber juice. -- Hee hee, so the weeds under the trees must be pulled out." When harvesting the rubber juice, groups of Malays, holding parang knives in their hands, would carefully and meticulously cut into the rubber tree trunks. Their cutting method was mostly in the shape of a "V" or a "Y."</p>
<p>My father was very strict in protecting the rubber trees, as if he were protecting his own life. Whenever the price of rubber rose, in order to catch the market, he would harvest it day and night, but my father was always a little worried about working at night, because when the workers were working, they had to hold a lantern in one hand and a parang knife in the other, and sometimes because of their excessive fatigue or insufficient light, they would inevitably damage the tree trunks. Therefore, my father would never easily work at night unless it was absolutely necessary.</p>
<p>There was a time when my father would wear his snowy waist knife after dinner and go to the garden in high spirits. At that time, hearing that my father was going to the rubber plantation always made me feel interested, and I would ask my father to take me with him, but my mother would stop me and say, "What are you doing following along, little kid? Your father is going to hunt down those wildlings who steal rubber seeds." Because at that time, each seed was worth a few cents, and Lao Yu couldn't manage such a large and vast rubber plantation alone at night, so my father had to personally go to the garden every night to help patrol.</p>
<p>Sometimes, after my father had drunk a few cups of burning wine, his face was red, like Guan Gong on the stage, and he was already tipsy. However, at this time, he always liked to open the iron safe and take out the rubber mountain bottom "ya lan" (deed) issued by the government, examining it upside down (naturally, my father didn't recognize the foreign words on it). He would very smugly, like a child, purse his lips and giggle at my mother, saying, "Lan, two hundred 'acres' of rubber mountain; look, -- now each 'acre' is worth more than five hundred yuan."</p>
<p>Once, my father came back from the rubber plantation and put a ball of rubber silk in the iron safe, which made my mother a little curious. She said:</p>
<p>"Why do you even put these rubber silks in the iron safe as if they were treasures?"</p>
<p>But my father replied seriously:</p>
<p>"Don't underestimate these two or three pounds of stuff, they're worth more than ten yuan now." His face showed a smug look.</p>
<p>That could be said to be my father's golden age, and it was also the happiest time in our family, but who could know that that was the most perfect and happiest time!</p>
<p>Now, my father's letters always say that the rubber industry in Nanyang is pitifully depressed, and even if each hundred pounds of rubber is reduced to more than ten yuan, no one will ask about it. Sometimes, because of the family's urgent needs, he is willing to transfer the rubber mountain bottom "ya lan" for three or five yuan per "acre" to others, but no one wants it either.</p>
<p>I returned home last year because I lost my job. When I walked to the rubber plantation that I had been away from for many years, there was not a single person in the rubber plantation. Lao Yu, who managed the rubber plantation, was already gone; it is said that he was dismissed by my father last year. The vast rubber plantation was not managed, and the weeds under the rubber trees grew wildly and vigorously, as high as the shins. No one stole the rubber seeds anymore, and they were allowed to scatter all over the ground, and the small rubber trees grew chaotically.</p>
<p>Recalling the prosperity of my father's rubber plantation in those years, it was only a little over ten years ago, but that prosperity has disappeared like flowing water without a sound!</p>
<p>When I silently recalled the scene of my father with a sharp waist knife inserted between the rubber trees, patrolling back and forth in the rubber plantation in high spirits, and the current desolate and unbearable situation, my heart couldn't help but feel sad.</p>
<p>From then on, I was afraid to go to my father's rubber plantation!</p>

<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>The days are gradually getting shorter, the summer dusk is now a black night. The clouds in the sky have lost their mixed colors and multifaceted illusions; in the mountain valleys in the wilderness, the maple leaves have gradually faded from their scorching red, and day by day have fallen into the brown days. The sky is gray and dull all day long, and in the low gray sky, it seems to be piled with snow and water. A somewhat cold wind blows threateningly, carrying the breath of yellow sand and dead branches. So, there is a rain in the morning and evening, a chill, and autumn flows past silently like a pile of old shadows, and then the sneaking winter comes, which is very ordinary and without warmth.</p>
<p>Yes, it is already winter. At dusk, sitting alone in the dim light, the surroundings are silent, as indifferent and茫然 as in another world. Looking out from the small window, the sky is such a small and gray-black piece, empty, desolate, and so, images enter a distant and strange realm at this time; I imagine traveling alone in the great desert of Mongolia, the wind rolls up the sand that blinds the eyes, rushing to the endless front, the setting sun spreads melancholy golden light on the boundless earth, between which, a person, a camel, slowly moves inch by inch in this sea of sand. Facing the sunset, it cast a strange shadow on the dry yellow sand; the camel neighed strangely from time to time in the evening wind, and the copper bell tied around its neck emitted an old and depressed sound with its heavy footsteps, sad and mournful, rolled in the brown wind, sparsely, and leisurely spread out, and would never stay on a grain of small sand...</p>
<p>Step by step, walking like that. Hope is lofty, but the current road is so渺茫 and arduous! The night is constantly attacking, and the terrible situation in the early winter desert is unimaginable! Footsteps and heartbeats, everything seems so monotonous! The camel bells scatter into the cold wind one by one, like pearls that have lost their string, like the bells of the underworld.</p>
<p>The setting sun has also disappeared, and the road still cannot be seen to the end; the sea of sand is so wide, and the camel is still swinging its ancient, slow steps, numb and foolishly walking, and so, the sound of copper bells one after another is likely to be imagined as an unfortunate cry for help.</p>
<p>What kind of situation is this? Even the imagination is terrible. However, over the years, I have finally thought of this situation three or four times. That's right, the world is too much like a desert at dusk. And life is like the winter wind! But what about the camel? What about the lonely and tired traveler? What about the camel bells scattered in the north wind?</p>
<p>Carrying heavy and sluggish days, I have lived through the years one by one. People will tremble when they think about it, but let the past go, and what about the future?</p>
<p>The future is a wilderness road without end!</p>
<p>Constantly walking, still so terrifying and lonely; but the sky is gradually darkening, and the wind is gradually becoming fierce. Every moment I can hear the footsteps of these camel-like days, those clear and melancholy camel bells; I feel colder, weaker, and more tired day by day. The sluggish camel bells and the long and desolate journey render life so desolate and terrible that I almost lose the strength to continue walking.</p>
<p>The camel bell rings two sounds, the days slowly climb forward, and in this way, they slowly send people to old age, make people wither, and send people to their final destination.</p>
<p>I saw: in the desolate desert, the camel is carrying the corpses of the previous generation and walking to some place, and the camel bell has become a death knell, constantly striking out some ominous sounds.</p>
<p>The sky in early winter is completely dark, and imagination makes me terrified. I seem to have had another nightmare!</p>
<h3 id="e203">The Seashore of the Island Nation <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Xin'er</p>
<p>The dark seawater gradually turns into emerald green, gently shining with beautiful, fine waves. The sea is enveloped in a verdant, fresh and lively appearance. The hearts of weary travelers are filled with bursts of joy.</p>
<p>On the deck, on the ship's railings, the joyful and smiling voices of companions:</p>
<p>"Come out and see, what beautiful mountains and sea..."</p>
<p>It is transmitted into the depressed cabin; so, many smiling faces, yearning for the alien island nation's seashore, gently flutter their hearts open, breathing sweet breaths—a first encounter!</p>
<p>The ship slowly advances along the winding bay of undulating green mountains, gliding over the calm and beautiful sea. Gazing at the iron railings. Lined up beautifully, but very distinctive in their lowliness, the boat and the mountain are so close, people rejoice and reach out, grasping the strangely protruding green mountain that has endured the dangerous winds for several days. Gentle! Without wind and waves, relying on the mountains and forests, infinitely light and clear. Looking back and fondly watching the bay, between the bay and the mountains, small fishing boats, people on the rocks, green trees drooping remotely over the water, leisurely and leisurely low and clever wooden houses. In front, a mountain canyon on both sides has appeared, and the ship rushes towards the canyon: in an instant, the mountain canyon is on the side, and people on the ship can see below the mountain by the water, in the clear and beautiful water, the sand and stones can be counted, and the shadows of fish move faintly. On the mountain tops and between the mountains on both sides, there are also farmland that is high and slanted like steps, and pine forests that seem to be artificially cultivated; there are thick-shaded ancient trunks, and clear and beautiful sparse rows, high and low, and each has its own style.</p>
<p>Sometimes, it suddenly emerges, vast on both sides, and looking forward urgently, the mountains are misty in the distance, on the vast sea, on the blue water without waves, there are dots of fishing boats, and elegant and clever small islands stand alone, which looks like a giant lake. Seeing the ship steadily and strongly sailing towards its destination, at this time I truly feel the high autumn and refreshing air, and the sunlight is particularly gentle. It turns out that the red sun in the sky has become a setting sun. At this time, the ship sails through the green waves, and on both sides, a huge long white ribbon seems to hang down, turning over between the emerald green waters, like a waterfall. Companions point to the black tiles and wooden houses by the mountains near the water in the distance, shouting loudly: That's the swimming beach! A place to escape the summer heat. An island nation has the unique charm of an island nation. I can't help but feel that way!</p>

<p>— Tianshe</p>
<p>The house is very narrow, without even a small courtyard, and the windows are scarce, so you won't know whether it's sunny or rainy outside inside the gate. You can't find a lotus tank or a cymbidium pot in the house, not even a small dish of rock calamus. In such a dark room, where not a trace of sunlight can penetrate, it is indeed not suitable for the survival of plants. People inside are still threatened by an indescribable depression.</p>
<p>But, is this almost an unexpected discovery? I stand by the dilapidated door frame of the kitchen shed, and there is a kind of dazzling life enticing me, I am happy, I even clap my hands and laugh.</p>
<p>Outside the kitchen shed door, there was originally a narrow alley, which a thin body could not pass through. High walls stood on both sides, and broken tiles, garbage, and rotten rags were scattered in a mess, damp and dirty; it was a breeding ground for water rats, earthworms, snails... I hate the smell of that filth, I hate to see that kind of corruption, and I think about moving almost every month. Today, however, I discovered a green bud in this filthy and dark place, about two inches long, as thick as an ear pick, with two small leaves on its head, and white near the roots, fully showing the glory of life. It is not affected by some foul environment, it is like a white navigation mark in the Black Sea. It is growing so courageously in adversity, giving mankind a great inspiration: survival is not limited by the environment.</p>
<p>This bud, this vitality, I silently wish it to grow up quickly, grow up...</p>
<p>But it also makes me worry, that water rat, that earthworm, that snail, that group of unknown dirty insects, will harm the continued growth of this small life, and even devour it. Moreover, the sunlight still does not shine on this alley. Although the germination of plants can be in a dark and humid place, its development and growth always require warm sunlight! So, I will shoulder the mission of protecting life.</p>

<p>This Thing is Too Strange</p>
<p>I think this thing is too strange! I think this thing is too strange! I feel like I've never mistreated you, I feel like I've never offended you, why don't you give me any news? Why don't you tell me your feelings? The green-clothed man comes, the bell rings, I am happy to hear the bell, other people all have letters arriving, but who knows, I have no letters. I look through autumn waves without any news, I stretch my neck and don't see you, tears of hibiscus drip, drip, my heart is full of feelings, I don't know where to start singing.</p>
<p>I think this thing is too strange! I think this thing is too strange! I feel like you were very sincere to me at the beginning, I feel like you were very understanding to me at the beginning, why do you suddenly give me a blow! Why do you suddenly say goodbye to me with difficulty! Recalling when I first met you, you were petite, lively, and very clever, now you have grown up with lofty ambitions, forgetting the past and starting a new opportunity. I left my parents far away for you, I abandoned my hometown far away for you, my liver and intestines are broken inch by inch, my sincere feelings, who knows they will not sink to the bottom of the sea.</p>

<p>Listen to the mournful cries.</p>
<p>The cries of mourning spread everywhere.</p>
<p>The most heavily affected area is Haining.</p>
<p>In past years, every family had rain during the plum season.</p>
<p>This year, every day during the yellow plum season is dry.</p>
<p>The water is shallow, the river is dry, and the land is cracked.</p>
<p>Farmers have no way to plant rice seedlings.</p>
<p>Even if a few families manage to plant rice seedlings.</p>
<p>But how can they survive the long drought without rain?</p>
<p>The seedlings wither and die.</p>
<p>A year's hope is equal to nothing.</p>
<p>Sighing for the farmers, they work hard in spring and summer.</p>
<p>Only hoping for a good harvest.</p>
<p>Experiencing such a cruel natural disaster.</p>
<p>How can they plan for the rest of their lives?</p>
<p>With no way out of the mountains and rivers.</p>
<p>Most of the farmers become disaster victims.</p>
<p>Some have exhausted their possessions and borrowed everything they can.</p>
<p>Pitifully, there is no way to survive.</p>
<p>Some sell their sons and daughters to prolong their lives.</p>
<p>It is sad to see the flesh and blood separated.</p>
<p>Some have no food and live a beggar's life.</p>
<p>Even leading to the whole family taking poison and sacrificing themselves.</p>
<p>Sad and tragic sights are hard to describe.</p>
<p>Even people with hearts of stone would shed tears.</p>
<p>Thinking that disaster relief cannot be delayed.</p>
<p>Using the strings to describe the disaster situation.</p>
<p>Admonishing all the enthusiastic philanthropists.</p>
<p>Also, the soft-hearted ladies and madams.</p>
<p>Everyone should show their compassionate thoughts.</p>
<p>Either donate rice and flour or donate silver.</p>
<p>Using benevolent soup and righteous grain to provide disaster relief.</p>
<p>Save those suffering disaster victims who are waiting to be fed.</p>
<p>You must know that saving a life has great merit.</p>
<p>Heaven will not let down those with good hearts.</p>
<p>It is better than building seven levels of a pagoda.</p>

<p>Regarding the news published in your esteemed publication yesterday that I have left the Shanghai Yan Yan Society and formed another XX Society to broadcast on XHHS. The Shanghai Yan Yan Society was jointly formed by my friends. How could I abandon it halfway? The society did temporarily suspend broadcasting for the sake of strict rectification. The news that I left the society was a misunderstanding by Mr. Xiao Si, which is very strange. Because I still have spare time, I have also joined the Hanyin Society as a violin accompanist and broadcast on XHHS. It is especially important to note that the Hanyin Society was not organized by me. I am sending this letter for correction. Yang Ping</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Zhihong, the violin teacher of the Great Natural Singing Society, participated in the accompaniment at the Qingping Society the day before yesterday. It is said that the Great Natural Singing Society has dissolved invisibly.</p>
<p>Miss Lin Yuwen of the Hanyin Society can play the violin and has studied "Hohmann" by Miki. She is still continuing her studies.</p>
<p>Misses Ying Jian and Ying Lian are both Boy Scouts. The day before yesterday, they were collecting donations on the street for the flood victims in various provinces.</p>

<p>Lianhua's special artistic work "Tianlun," which is eagerly awaited throughout the country, will be premiered this month at Shanghai's largest theater.</p>
<p>"The 'Going to Nature' location shooting team returned from Qingdao and then went to Changhua. The Changhua work lasted four days and has now returned to start shooting interior scenes. The performance time of the play is mostly in summer. Jin Yan, Li Lili, etc., work with bare arms and legs, braving the cold.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng's new work "The Lost Lamb" boldly confronts reality and handles it with superior techniques. Everything will surpass "Fisherman's Song" and be Cai's proud masterpiece. The whole play is relaxed and funny, but the core is very poignant.</p>
<p>"Hanjiang Luoyan", which took the longest time to film and cost a huge amount of capital, has already captured the great pier scene. This scene took two days and nights to complete. In addition to this scene, a few scattered shots need to be filmed, and the whole play can be completed.</p>
<p>The prop room has recently made thousands of paper lanterns and many paper heads, which are said to be used in the play "Weeping Remnants of Red".</p>
<p>"Lang Taosha" is currently filming a transport ship scene. Jin Yan's sailor outfit shows a calm and powerful performance. Although the ship is placed on land, the background arrangement is ingenious, making it look as if it is sailing on the sea.</p>
<p>There is a movie screening scene in "The Lost Lamb". This movie has a screen and a projector, but the actors' performance is not on the film, but in front of the projector, performing powerful satire, which delights the audience.</p>
<p>In "Three Modern Men", Liu Jiqun sings a new New Fengyang song, as well as "Mama's Song". Han Langan and Yin Xiucen sing a Cuban peanut buying song together.</p>
<p>Ge Zuozhi and Chen Juanjuan play little lovers in the two films "The Lost Lamb" and "慈母曲".</p>

<p>Shi Dongshan's "Song of Everlasting Regret" is currently filming location shots in Hangzhou, staying at the Qintai Second Hotel on West Lake.</p>
<p>It is said that the "Song of Everlasting Regret" location shooting team played two basketball games in Hangzhou, losing to Minsheng Middle School 24 to 32, and winning against Hulin Middle School 30 to 15.</p>
<p>After the Chinese Film Society published an issue of "Ten Days of Film", there has been no news since. It is said that the ocean costs eight yuan, and the person in charge of the association, Xiao Chui, had a big fight with someone named Ding, and Xiao Dun's face was swollen and red, unable to see guests.</p>
<p>The "Resurrection" drama of Diantong is currently rehearsing the first act (a total of five acts). It is planned to rehearse each act for six days, completing the rehearsal within a month, from 2:00 PM to 8:00 PM every day.</p>
<p>The outside world is rumored that the female lead of "Resurrection" is Lan Ping. After investigation, this is not accurate. The female lead is actually Miss Chen Boer. As for Lan Ping, there is no role for her in "Resurrection".</p>

<p>Mr. Tian Han's literary and academic achievements and thoughts are admired by everyone. He can write the sad and complex life in novels, and he can also write the sad and complex life in songs, and he can make readers, singers, and listeners be moved.</p>
<p>The songs in "Heroes of the Times" were written by Mr. Tian Han. They were the first songs he wrote after living in Nanjing for a long time. He wrote all the phenomena of the play in these songs. He wrote all the indignation of the play in these songs. The tragic singing can especially arouse magnificent feelings, like a lion's roar, like a tiger's roar, making listeners not know whether it is a song - a twilight drum, a morning bell!</p>
