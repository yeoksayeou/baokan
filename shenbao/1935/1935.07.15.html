<h3 id="c14">英日矛盾之尖銳化 <a href="#c14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— 昂</p>
<p>日本林陸相上月視察偽國歸。以日軍在滿苦不堪言。力主實行第二步工作。迨冀察事件告一段落。土肥原復向關東軍建議。在華北謀經濟發展。邇來中日經濟提携之聲。遂甚　塵上矣。吾人就觀察所及。粗知日本之經濟策略。具有二大目的。一爲謀偽國與華北之打成一片。一爲樹立所謂東亞集團。以中日「滿」爲基礎。惟在力求貫澈之過程中。必與英美發生更深烈之利害衝突。可斷言也。</p>
<p>據政治經濟學家言。一國分裂後。其各部分經濟上之調整與政治上之改造爲極端困難之問題。故被割裂之部分在新政治組織下。其鐵路制度以及其他交通事業。與以前所屬政治組織下之都市商埠港口有互相卸接之必要。日人以軍力侵佔東北四省。關內外之經濟聯絡。突被切斷。我國固大受打擊。而日本之經營四省。亦有極大困難在。是以日人於軍事行動之後。卽進一步有通郵通車之要求。今復亟謀經濟之合作矣。據日本報紙所載。日本所屬目者。爲山西之煤。陝西之油。察哈爾之鐵。渤海之鹽。以及河北山東河南之棉。其中尤以對棉最爲重視。蓋大阪之紡織業發展至速。年需棉花。價値日金十萬萬元之鉅。類多購自美國及印度。近以對於美印方面之貿易。頗處不利地位。亟思轉變方向。以謀補救。據最近消息。南滿鐵路公司副總裁八田與南司令官及其他關東軍首腦部對於此事恊議之結果。决定先從調查華北經濟狀况入手。而於天津設管理機關。然後根據調究結果。再定具體辦法。此日本經濟策略上第一目的之表現也。</p>
<p>抑日本尙有更大之目的。卽謀納中日「滿」於東亞集團之下是也。自一九二九年世界經濟恐慌發生以來。歐美各國實行經濟的國家主義以自。保美旣提高關稅。英亦組成沃太華集團。日本工業膨脹。而市塲日縮。乃施展其傳統之大陸政策。進佔我四省領土。據日外務省中人最近之理論。滿洲事變爲華盛頓會議之發展。亦卽對九國公約之反動。蓋日本以九國公約所規定之門戶開放機會均等諸原則。無非欲使盎格羅薩克遜民族權利合法。化卽南京條約所遺留之治外法權。亦無非英帝國主義藉以　取特惠之工具耳。廣田外相登台之初。東京方面曾一度宣傳。首先放棄在華治外法權之說。殆欲以表示日本對南京條約之進攻歟。就上以觀日本之用意。顯在根本上推翻一切以歐美人利益爲出發點之南京條約。及九國公約而另以日帝國主義之利益爲前提。樹立所謂東亞集團。換言之。卽欲將東亞大局置於某種新基礎。而與不列顚之沃太華主義集團。美利堅之孟祿主義集團。以及蘇俄之社會主義集團相抗衡也。</p>
<p>自九一八以來。日本之欲排斥外力。不無蛛絲馬跡可尋。去年四月十七日。外務省反對各國與我合作之非正式聲明。卽其試探之舉動。今年三月二十三一偽滿方面之收買中東路。及四月十日之實行煤油專賣。皆其計畫之逐步見諸事實者。此外如思想方面。則高唱回復東方固有文化論。提倡尊孔。在國內學校。且有重漢文廢外國語之議。卽對我國人之深通英語者。在私人交際間。彼此本可以英語直接談話。乃故請舌人。以中日語轉輾翻譯。其用心之周且細。可見一斑矣。</p>
<p>英美兩國於此遠東局勢嚴重之際。似已憬然覺悟。而英國尤有急起自謀之勢。其巳見於形跡者。如鮑爾溫艾登諸要人之對美頻送秋波。如賈德幹升任大使前後言行上之種種暗示。至於英政府特派其首席經濟顧問黎樂施於八月問來華一舉。尤堪玩味。無怪英國朝野一致視爲近數十年來對遠東之唯一積極行動也。日昨新外相霍賽穆復在下院聲稱。「維持開放門戶之原則以及充分承認中國之自主權。仍爲英國政業之廣大基礎」。又云。「中國如欲恢復其在世界上之歷史的地位。則需助於西方者實不减於東方」此其對於遠東時局之積極表示。更爲顯露矣。</p>
<p>英日兩國爲遠東利益互相爭持之局。今巳開展矣。此於我爲近百年來罕有之遭遇。卽於世界亦爲東西兩大勢力消長之關鍵。將來變化至若何局面。在今尙不易言。吾人首當其衝。將何以善處乎自力更生。固爲不易之論。然當此國際關係異常錯綜之新時代。外交上之應付。要爲最須審愼考慮者。所幸我民族導師中山先生。在其遺著及遺囑中。對於我國外交方針。早有原則上明確之詔示。想當局諸公。雖在極度危難之秋。當亦奉爲圭臬者也。</p>

<p>所以大家都應養成這利勞動習慣、發揮這種服務的精神、以後每個人至少每天要做一件有利於別人的事情、來爲社會造福、將來推而廣之，才可做治國平天下的大事業、</p>
<p>第四、要認識我們在家庭中的地位與責任、你們要曉得子弟在家庭中的地位與責任、和你們在國家的地位與責任、雖有範圍廣狹之不同、其中道理並無二致、你們在國家要做一個忠良的國民、在家庭便要做一個賢能的孝子，事父母要孝順、對兄長要尊敬、對弟妹要和愛、更要發揮孝友睦姻任卹的美德、以敦誼睦隣、推之族黨鄉里親戚朋友、都要相親相愛、以餘力相勞、道義相勉、休戚相同、守望相助、疾病相扶持、至於家庭裏的俛父兄長輩、也應該負責敎好自己的子弟、使知道做人的道理、更應該督率他們習勞習苦、不要呌子弟茍且偷惰、變成一個寄生蟲、來害家禍國、我可以吿訴你們我少年的時候，家十裏也還可算是小康之家、但是我每天照例要洗衣、掃地、煮飯和做其他種種的家庭勞務、我母親也督責我每天要這樣做、因為這是我們做人最基本最緊要的道理、必須從小在家庭裏養成這種勞動服務的精神和習慣、長大的時候、然後可以故一個建全的國民、現在有許多小學生、在家庭裏不僅不能為長上效勞盡孝、往往還要父母替他盛飯洗衣、伺候一切、這就不是做子弟的道理、像這樣對於自己和自己家庭裏的事情都不願做、將來還可以替社會國家効力嗎、一般做父見的人、不敎子弟習勞習苦、致使子弟的體格、日趨脆弱、精神日趨萎　、這種姑息之愛、愛之適以害之、也不是為父母的道理、所以你們一般靑年學生、在家庭裏第一要老親尊長、敬兄愛弟、和姻睦鄰、其次使應勞動、一切打水洒埽、洗滌煮飯·園藝·等種種事情、都要我們自己來做、替一家老小效勞、由此就可以養成高尙的人格、鍜鍊强健的體魄造成一個健全國民的基礎、</p>

<p>— 丙丁</p>
<p>這個年頭，無論男女職業，都是露出『尖銳化』。難道是循着達爾文氏『適者生存』『物競天擇』的軌道？還是世風日下，人心日漓的緣故？只要找得着飯盌，賺得着金錢，無須問其手段，猙獰的面目，卑鄙的行為，一切的一切，眞是沒得話說。</p>
<p>女人職業，在幾年前，常常見到洋洋灑灑提倡大文章，不是言之成理，持之有故嗎？到了現下，女人的職業，委實有些難說。</p>
<p>別的且不談，單說洗衣女人吧。我們××大樓，裏面至少有七八十家的公司寫字間。每天早晨，便有十幾個荳蔻年華打扮摩登的妙齡女人，肩了衣包，扭扭捏捏，到寫字間來問有沒有洗的衣服。去了一個，又來一個，這原是平常的事。但，儇薄的青年夥計，故意搭訕輕薄，你一句，我一句，把穢褻的話來調笑。甚至動手動脚起來。那洗衣女人，也是打情罵俏，做出許多醜態，來彈動儇薄靑年的心絃。</p>
<p>咱們公司裏同事的那一個洗衣女子，同事都喊伊「老太婆」。咱起初沒瞧見那個洗衣女人，聽說名喚『老太婆』，在想像中，以為是一個雞皮鶴髮的人，否則也是一個四五十歲的人。有一天早晨八點鐘，我走進公司寫字間，瞧見一個十七八歲少女，在裏面跟咱們同事搭訕頭，我方才知道所謂『老太婆』也者，便是這個女人。原來咱們公司裏的洗衣生意，是伊婆婆做的；後來因為生意有些被別的洗衣女人奪去，不是說老太婆洗滌不乾掙，便是說燙得不調勻。老太婆受了許多吹求，忽然明白癥結所在，自知年老珠黃不值錢了，只得快把這個洗衣職業，改變了營業的方法，自己在家裏只幹洗滌工作，跑街的職務，便交媳婦女兒去担任，生意便一天天好起來了。</p>

<p>我於是便吿訴伊荊裏的畫板的顏色和花的顏色太相似了，不但不能襯托出花的美麗來，並將使那畫板也受了影響；我滔滔地給伊講論着，絕未注意到伊臉上的表情，共實伊那時簡直一絲笑容都沒有。但最後伊還是採納了我的意見。</p>
<p>「旣然這樣，便隨你的意思把它安在別處好了！」</p>
<p>我當然是非常的高興，忙利用了我自己的審美眼光，給這一瓶鮮花找到了一個適當的位置；太后瞧了，似乎也覺得如此一變換，整個屋子中的色調上，的確巳和諧了許多。雖不曾讚美，却也未曾表示什麽不滿。這伴事就像這樣過去了。</p>
<p>不久之後，這件事已不為我所牢記着了，便是太后，也决不會再記得的了；我簡直始終糊塗着，直至最後才知道這伴事要是嚴格論來，我已不折不扣的得了一個罪名了！這是如何知道的呢？就因為這一天，—太后請四位御醫來診病的這天—我又第二度很大膽地犯了同樣的錯誤，才被人家提醒過來的。</p>
<p>這天的傍晚，太后因為在服藥後已假寐了一二小時，所以寒熱已退了許多；但是外面雨仍在下着，太后悶坐在宮內，已感覺到十二分的煩悶，再加伊的咳嗽，依然不停的在困擾着伊，因此越發的使伊煩悶了。（三六五）</p>

<p>可是，這複雜社會的階層，偏多一些不要臉的東西的攔路打刦似的小偷隨便拆閱人家的信件；倘使你住在樓上，郵差先生的信件常是擁擠，一旦甩在樓下，那些厚臉的人便視同印刷品般亂拆了；雖然別人的言語，他們根本就隔閡，然而，總要同小耗子似的不管吃下吃不下，亂咬一頓，然後索性和新聞紙類一般同歸於字紙簍的命運。</p>

<p>志前，這倒有些後悔。人家本就極端的難受，何苦又給人家加上一種刺激？索興不必走了，看他究竟怎麽樣？過了一會，他很沉悶的咳嗽了兩聲。將手提了桌上的茶壺柄，要斟茶喝，隨着轉過臉來。他的頭，本是低的，先只看到他的頭髮，似乎有些蓬鬆。他慢慢的揚起臉來，正好向志前這裏看了家。就在那鼻邊眼角落裏，有兩行眼淚，順着顴骨裏的兩道直斜紋，滾了下來。他這時並不迥避着志前的眼光，反是向他呆看着，好像是在他那一副呆臉，兩行眼淚裏面把無數的難言之隱，都給表現出來。志前放下報，也向他看呆了。不過這地方，是前後幾廥院子來去的要路，來來往往的人，那是很多。當有一位旅客由這裏經過的時候，志前立刻想到月英已經是人家的家眷，自己憑了什慶，可以和人家表示這種凄怨的態度呢？於是只當沒有看到這個人，將報紙向桌心裏一推，低着頭微微的歎了一口氣。不想這樣極細微的動動作，月英也是看得很淸楚。就在這個時候，只見他放了茶壺一下響，猛可的將手伏在桌子上，人就俯伏了下去，枕在手臂上，不必看到他的臉，已經知道他會哭出來的。若是賈多才看到了，說是撩撥他的新寵，這可不是兒戲的事。因一秒鐘的時間也不敢躭擱，扭轉身軀，就向後院裏走了（二六五）</p>

<p>一、石炭酸水，這是有毒的劇藥，以九十八克蘭姆微溫水，混石炭酸二克蘭姆而成，手指，器械類消毒時（為三十倍至五十倍）揩拭損傷部分時（在二十倍至三十倍）二，克雷梭石碱液（Liquor　Cresoli　Saponatus）以三十倍的微溫水溶化，其數同上，三，酒精，酒精二分淸水一分配合，其效同上，四，沃度丁幾（碘酒）以為消毒去腫發炎撲傷等用，五，硼酸水，為含嗽洗眼洗傷的用，六，葛里舍林（Glycerinum）防唇的乾燥，如配以五倍或十倍水的等分液，可以灌陽，七，硫酸亞鉛水，點眼用，八，阿勒五油（Oleum　Olivae）搽擦損傷，九，亞姆尼亞水，為毒蟲所咬時搽擦用，又失神發痧時，嗅之亦效，十，亞鉛華，敷在擦傷皮膚濕潤潰爛部分，十一，薄荷液，頭痛齒痛神經痛時擦之奇效。</p>
<p>內服藥</p>
<p>（一）重炭酸那德留姻，治胸悶船暈，（二）次硝酸蒼鉛，通大便後可以整理胃腸，（三）苦味丁幾，規那丁幾，食悠不振健胃的藥，（四）阿司匹林，治感冒風鎭邪痛里麻的司等用，（五）臭素那德留姆，或臭素加里秀姆，治鎮靜·神經衰弱·心悸不寗·失眠·痙攣等病，（六）貝麻油，治食物中毒與可疑的小兒疫痢，（七）克羅爾那德留姆，（Natriumoratum）治吐血催吐，（八）馬克銀（Macnin）驅蟲藥，（九）米葛雷銀（Migraeninum）治頭痛，解熱。烟酒暈等，（十）舍乃加（Senegae）止咳用。</p>
<p>醫療器</p>
<p>（一）洗眼杯，（二）吸入器，（三）紗布，（四）藥水棉花，（五）體溫計，（六）消毒觀，（七）浣腸器，（八）量水杯，（九）戰秤，（十）注射器，（靜脈注射應請醫生）</p>
<p>年齡與藥量</p>
<p>大凡一歲以下的嬰兒，每次服1／15—1／10，一日服二十竓，一歲至二歲每次服1／8，一日服三十竓，二歲至三歲服1／6，三歲至四歲服1／4，每日服三十五竓，五歲至七歲服1／3每日約服四十竓，七歲至十四歲每次服2／3十四歲至二十歲服2／3—3／4，二十歲至六十歲服—，六十歲以上服2／3—3／4</p>
<p>服藥的注意</p>
<p>我們由醫院配來的　，在瓶上或包上，必記有一食前三十分鐘」，或「食後五分鐘」的字樣，這本無嚴格的意義，大抵酸類的藥，在食前飲服最宜，害胃的藥，以食後為宜。空腹時，藥性容易吸收，但吸收很强的藥，那以食後為宜。又服藥時，切不可用茶呑服，好比含有鐵質的藥，其丹銀必爲茶所溶解，小兒服藥時，加些糖類，無碍效力，他如（一）服解熱得藥，王往往害胃，反引起副作用，不宜空腹，月須在熱降下時服，（二）服通便的藥，大概因腸胃不好，分泌物有障碍，應當在空腹時與臨臥時呑服，（三）服催眼藥應用開水呑服，效力比較為快。</p>

<h3 id="c172">泰興縣醫事衛生事業概况 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 成心良</p>
<p>泰興雖是個濱江小邑。僻處江北。他到也有八十萬的人口。一百二十萬畝的土地。祇是因為內地交通不便的關係。外面人就很少有曉得他內容的。</p>
<p>泰興人民。大都以農為業。沿江一帶。出產稻棉。城東一帶。盛產高梁黃豆。米棉只够本縣人吃穿。黃豆大都榨油供食。餅則喂猪子肥田，高梁煮成酒。和猪子兩項。同為本縣出口貨物的大宗。</p>
<p>這地舊文化程度頗高。遜淸時代。取三十六名秀才。人民為學。喜作官。迷信也自免不了。不過現在受着新文化的薰陶。一切都有革新的氣象了。</p>
<p>現在全縣共有初級中學三所。小學七十餘校。所以許多的學童。小學一畢業。就要出縣就學了。現在各地中學。泰興的學生。要佔百分之二的數目。就是在外洋留學也很不少。</p>
<p>至于交通方面。上海南京都祗不要十二小時就可到達。內地公路。現在積極計劃建築。已成路某的。有省道啟浦路。縣道口泰路。同黃泰路。都通行汽車。全縣內河則通行汽船。城內外則通行人力車。交通尙稱便利。</p>
<p>現在談到衛生。我們單就城廂說吧。</p>
<p>新醫是近二十年的事。衛生更是近兩年來的事。城內有舊醫三百多個。最有名的不過十多位而已。舊醫在從先是絕大多的勢力。現在雖然是迴光返照。不過已成强弩之末了。新醫也有十多位。都是南通畢業。糾成醫師公會。很有勢力。所以副牌子都下鄕開業去了。新醫多私人開業。最著名的有延令醫院。介壽醫院。和愛生醫院。他們業務尙稱不惡。舊藥舖有四十多個。最大的要算仁源生。和慶春餘了。因為他們每年都宰鹿。新藥業有延令藥房。中外大藥房。和英美藥房。他們都會製成藥。也請有藥劑師。也配方子。賺利不小。其他的新藥。如人丹之類。各大洋貨店。都帶着賣。</p>
<p>縣立醫院的屋子。已經砌好了。因為經費和人民不十分自動切要的關係。沒有成功。現在改成縣戒烟所。</p>
<p>縣戒烟所的經費。都是由省撥充。人員也是由省委派。可容烟犯一百人。辦理尙好。不過與人民沒有好感。這也難怪。這些事情是很難討人好的。</p>
<p>本縣的衛生行政。還是由公安局辦理。每年照例舉行衛生運動兩次。貼衛生標語。開游藝會。表演芥蠅蚊子之類的衛生戲劇。大掃除時縣長率領抱着掃帚。也頗認真。今年夏季衛生運動大會。收買蒼蠅五校銅元一百頭。街上貼的衛生標語也不少。</p>
<p>有個縣種痘局。免費為人民接種牛痘。各診所裏裏有附帶為人接種預防針的還有施醫局。是紅萬字會辦的。免費診病送藥。夏天財送痧藥。送止痢藥。</p>
<p>新醫的診金。門診一角至二角。出診一元至十元。西藥由二角五分一劑起碼。中醫的診金。門診一百文至五百文不等。出診三角至二、元不等。他們都是受封子。並沒。定診例。中藥是起碼一角錢一劑。人民的對兩方面的信仰力。尙屬平衡。所以新醫和舊醫。面子上還相安無事。沒有什麼衝突。</p>
<p>不過預防醫學太差了。衛生敎育更談不到。隨地吐疾。滿巷拉尿。誰知道衛生的重要呢。大家都知道生了病請菩薩保佑。請醫生處方。那裏知道未生病時衛生保健的重要呢。學校要除去生理衛生外。對于衛生的真諦。還不甚明瞭</p>
<p>現在有周雪漁醫師。在泰興民報上發表通俗醫學講座。啟導民民。是很可喜的。</p>
<p>上面是泰興醫事衛生概况之大略。如有錯誤或部到之處。尙希本邑人士指正。</p>
<h3 id="c173">結核之最近觀察（下） <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 丁惠康</p>
<p>—學說之變遷及其合併療法—</p>
<p>結核菌侵襲氣管枝淋巴腺之途徑有二：（一）卽經過血行器而達肺部，發生初發性之集結。（二）第二為淋巴腺，卽經過單獨性之許多腺羣，而達到氣管枝淋巴腺。在發育之年齡，則氣管枝腺最易長時間收藏結核菌，故結核菌亦多以此為其大本營。</p>
<p>發炎性結核症之形成，大約可分三類：</p>
<p>（一）結核細菌性發炎（Lieberweister李氏）bacillaere</p>
<p>（二）結核有毒性發炎（Poncet氏）toxisch</p>
<p>（三）結核過敏性終炎（Schwly蘇次氏）allergisch</p>
<p>李氏之觀察，以為慢性發炎之結核症，乃一種輕度之結核傳染，其原因由於少量之結核菌，而不能成為組織上正式起變化之結核症，故無結核之形成，如腺病等是。此等症候，李氏用次亞鹽酸素，在血液中可騐出結核菌矣。</p>
<p>結核有毒性發炎，法國醫家旁氏在一八九七年，已發表結核性僂麻質斯Rheumatimus之形成，以為乃由於結核菌之毒質，侵入關節滑液中，而引起發炎狀態。其他如氣管枝炎胃炎陰戶炎等，均可因是而發生。</p>
<p>結核過敏性發炎，則與蛋白質之崩壞及分解中毒，有莫大之關係。</p>
<p>假如有一氣管枝淋巴腺，時有結核菌之侵入與吸收，其腺組織因之而崩將壞，引起發炎滲出壞疽，或成乾酪變性。若結核菌與其毒素及各種崩壞物，同時由腺之內部而流向淋巴腺管或血行器，同時身體方面，或經過外來之刺激，而致異常虛弱時，則各種防禦力可吿崩潰，而發生疾病之現象，卽所謂結核過敏性發炎是也。</p>
<p>但結核過敏性發炎之成立，必有二種之成因：</p>
<p>（一）身體內必已有結核病灶之存在</p>
<p>（二）蛋白質分解之崩壞</p>
<p>結核有毒性發炎之現象，多屬於慢性。而結核過敏性發炎，則多屬於急性，而特殊發出。蘇氏以為眼膜炎鼻炎喉頭炎等，均屬於過敏性者。</p>
<p>發炎性結核，經遇諸方面之免疫力，可變成第三期肺病患者。（卽變成隱藏之結核患者，與向來所稱第三期結核之意義，完全不同。）</p>
<p>對於結核有特殊性之藥品，僅有土白而克林，Tuberculin（按柯赫氏發明結核菌之後，土白而克林，於結核治療上，盛極一時，嗣以功效不著，故全世界漸皆不用，近數年來以其能增加吾人對於結核之抗毒素，又紛紛應用矣。）但應用時須十分注意。若經愛克司光之檢査，無活動性之肺病灶，及無初期浸潤時，始可應用。於結核過敏性發炎之患者，須待其中毒之過敏性退去，卽用變質方法，不再使其有中毒現象，而達到平常狀態時，方可應用。變質之治療方法，如物理的，營養的，均是。尤以變換環境，乃變質治療之重要問題。至於藥物方面，如鈣質砒質鐵質等，而尤以金屬鹽最為重要，於其大量應用時，可達到迅速變質之目的。（附註純粹之維他命D，對於結核症不見有若何影響，而大量之濫用，對於人體極為有害。嬰兒有因濫用而致死者。有人以為維他命應四種同時並用，或維他命A與D，最好與鈣燐劑同時應用，則效用大而毒性可以减少，聚論紛紜，莫衷一是。惟其有毒性，則已完全確實證明，還以服用魚肝油及新鮮水果為要。）</p>
<p>土白而克林及金屬鹽之合併療法，對於發炎結核症，殆為今曰最合宜之治療方法矣。（專門手術之施行，因限於篇幅，日後當另篇述之。）—寄自德國漢堡大學肺病研究院。</p>
<h3 id="c174">被割除膵臟的狗 <a href="#c174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>—醫學故事之四—</p>
<p>大概在西歷一八九〇年，史脫拉斯堡的一個著名的醫生，名叫腦寗（Naunyn）的，某日偶然在他的醫院中的天橋上走過，望見下面院子上有許多狗，分為兩組，中間用籬笆隔開。它們是某生理學敎授研究消化機能應用的試騐品。他已把幾隻狗的膵臟割除，察看有無生理變化，為避免混雜起見，他把羣狗分為兩組，一組是被割除膵臟的，一組是膵臟未割除的。天氣暖洋洋的，腦寗醫生以科學家兼詩人的心境憑欄俯瞰，突然發見一個奇蹟：被割除膵臟的羣狗所遺的尿上面有成羣的蠅密集着，而另一組羣狗所遺的尿上面則否。這兩種尿的滋味一定是兩樣的：他心裏想。他走到院子上，收拾些羣蠅光顧的狗尿帶回去化騐，果然發見其中含有糖質。他便跑進生理學敎授的實騐室。</p>
<p>「你對那院子土的羣狗幹了些什麼」？他問生理學敎授。</p>
<p>「我把幾隻狗的膵臟割除」，學生敎授回答。</p>
<p>「那麽」，腦寗醫生喊起來，「缺乏膵液就是糖尿病的原因啦」。</p>
<p>這是醫學史上記錄着的關於糖尿病原因的發明的一個故事。尿帶甜味，是糖尿病的顯著的現象；正惟如此，所以早期的醫學界大都把糖尿病當作一種腎病。耶穌紀元最初十年間，阿理替斯（Aretaur）竟說明糖尿病是「肉的消解，隨尿排出」。直到上述的故事發生，腦寗醫生纔發明以身體消瘦與小便增多為重要症象的糖尿病的原因並不在於腎臟，却在於另外一個臟器。當然，這只是發明的開端，糖尿病原因的確定與治療的成功還得依賴以後許多實騐與發見咧。</p>
<p>那麽，糖尿病是怎樣發生的呢？先就平常人說：食物中的澱粉和糖，因消化液的作用，變成葡萄糖，由腸輸入肝臟。到了肝臟，葡萄糖變成一種炭水化物—肝液素，或稱動物澱粉。肌肉收縮，需要力，這力幾乎完全是從葡萄糖得</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>來的。為供給葡萄糖起見，肝臟排出肝液素，肝液素又在肝臟中或肌肉中變成葡萄糖。當肌肉收縮的時候，葡萄糖被燃燒，卽氧化—它和血液帶來的氧化合—因而產生熱與力，同時葡萄糖的分子變成水，二氧化碳，和少量的乳酸。使葡萄糖燃燒的火星，就是「島精」—膵臟中的「郎氏島」的分泌物，當肌肉收縮的時候，從膵臟分泌島精與從肝臟分泌肝液素這兩者是同時需要的。</p>
<p>在糖尿病者的營養機構中，這一切都與常人相同，只有一點不同，就是：他的郎氏島不健全，不能分泌島精，或分泌量太少。因此，走入肌肉中的葡萄糖不起燃燒，便積聚在血液中。腎臟對於血液中的過量的葡萄糖是非常敏感的。因此，當血液中葡萄糖增多的時候，腎臟就把從血液中抽除，用足量的水分把它溶解，和入尿液中排出體外，為什麼糖尿病牽涉到尿液，為什麼腎臟擔受造成糖尿病的寃枉，為什麽糖尿病者常感口渴：這一切從這里都可得到解答。</p>
<p>現存的糖尿病研究家胡特耶忒（Wooyatt）說糖尿病者好比一部不良的汽油引擎，頗為確切。為使引擎開動起見（為使肌肉收縮起見），汽油必須從油箱中排（肝液素—葡萄糖—必須從肝臟中排出），和碳化器中的空氣混合（葡萄糖和血液帶來的空氣混合），但為發火起見，火星栓必須特生一個火星（膵臟必須產生島精）。假如火星栓汚損（假如郎氏島不健全），則燃燒不完全，黑烟從排汽機排出（葡萄糖隨尿液排出）。</p>
<p>糖尿病治療的進步，當然由於糖尿病性質的明瞭。自島精製劑發明後，醫生對於糖尿病就有完全治療的把握了。</p>

<p>— 程瀚章</p>
<p>（六十）肌肉風濕痺</p>
<p>問　什麽叫做肌肉風濕痺？</p>
<p>答　這是一種急性或慢性的肌肉發痠痛的疾病。</p>
<p>問　怎樣會起肌肉風濕痺？</p>
<p>答　有許多人，因為體質關係或因為遺傳性，向發這種疾病。至於體外的原因，像天氣寒冷潮濕，某一條肌肉，忽然發起病來，例如「硬頸」就是。還有因為勞苦工作或外傷之類，也得發生肌肉風濕痺，例如「腰痛」「外傷肌痛」等就是。</p>
<p>問　肌肉風濕痺，和個人的職業有沒有關係？</p>
<p>答　很有關係，凡農夫，山間居住的人，和洗濯婦很多。</p>
<p>問　這種病的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　肌肉風濕痺的病狀，有急性和慢性二種。</p>
<p>問　急性的怎樣？</p>
<p>答　急性的病狀；是忽然一條肌肉或其附近的肌肉羣，起牽痛或裂痛。這種疼痛很利害，在休息的時候，也覺得；到勞動的時候非常劇烈，所以不能動彈。若用力壓迫肌肉的中間部分，倒也不怎樣。遇到寒冷，痛得利害；遇到溫暖却能緩解。</p>
<p>問　急性肌肉風濕痺，在肌肉的本體，有什麽異狀？</p>
<p>答　發病的肌肉稍些腫脹，在肌肉的附着點，肌鞘和腱，都有疼痛。有時起痙攣性收縮。病忠的部分往往彎曲，像腰部的側彎就是。</p>
<p>問　急性肌肉風濕痺，在身體的那幾部分最易發生？</p>
<p>答　在肩胛，頭項，腰部，胸前，頭部等處最易發生。</p>
<p>問　急性肌肉風濕痺，除了肌肉病狀外有無其他病狀？</p>
<p>答　有發熱，但不很高；也有發鼻感胃的，但沒有心臟變化。</p>
<p>問　這種病的經過，大概要幾天？</p>
<p>答　數天後就得治愈；但很容易再發。</p>
<p>問　慢性肌肉風濕痺的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>答　在不知不覺之間從一條肌肉移行到另一條肌肉發疼痛；或發在某一肌羣。病肌有硬固的收縮結節。</p>
<p>問　怎樣可以診斷肌肉風濕痺？</p>
<p>答　因為這種病，主要在肌肉的自覺疼痛，所以很容易被詐病者所隱蔽。不可不注意。在客觀的診斷十分困難。</p>
<p>問　肌肉風濕痺的治療，應該怎樣？</p>
<p>答　急性的，可行藥物療法，像內服柳酸製劑，亞陀方和安替比林等。局部用湯婆熱水袋保溫，行蒸汽浴使他發汗。皮膚用樟腦酒精，芥末酒精塗布。</p>
<p>問　慢性的呢？</p>
<p>答　慢性的可行局部的按摩，和溫泉浴療法。蒸汽浴也有相當的效力。</p>

<p>臭鼻症又名惡臭性瘦削性鼻炎。是瘦削性鼻炎的一種。在鼻科疾病中要算一種特殊的病。本病患者的鼻腔粘膜反甲介骨質。特別瘦削。失去生理的狀態。因此鼻腔異常擴大。分泌物容易結痂。發生一種劇烈難受的惡臭。講到他的原因。諸說紛紜。莫衷一是。有副鼻腔瀦膿症說，細菌說，營養不調說，遺傳說，先天梅毒說，及下甲介肥厚說。據最近醫家的報吿及我個人的臨診經驗上看起來。似以細菌說較為接近。因為本病的病源菌？業經證實。並可製作「伐克辛」療治本病。牠的效果。有時甚為確實。本病患在少年的時候最多。幼年及老人患的較少。女子則又多於男子。尤以發病於春機發動斯的為最多。再可注意的，就是本病患者的營養。大都不良。一般現出貧血的病容。</p>
<p>本病發作的起始。多為潛行性。患者自已多不知道有着這種病。不過由鼻腔裏分泌稍多的鼻液而已。如此數年之後（卽至春機發動期）。鼻腔內始放一種惡臭的氣味。本病的三大主徵。亦卽次第發生。所謂三大主徵。就是（一）分泌物的劇臭，（二）痂塊的形成，及（三）鼻腔粘膜的萎縮。現在分別述之如左。</p>
<p>（一）分泌物的劇臭這個症候，是本病最主要的一個主徵。牠所以稱為臭鼻症者。也是因為有着這個劇臭症候的緣故。牠的臭氣。是和其他鼻腔疾病（像副鼻腔病）的臭氣。完全相異。他那一種臭氣。眞可令人作三日嘔。彷彿一種捺死臭蟲的惡臭。或如一種腐敗物的臭氣。總之。是一種令人可厭可惡可嘔的惡臭。在臭氣劇烈的時候。若與患者同在一室。卽可嗅得。所以患者大都不願涉足交際塲中。免受他人遠而避之的恥辱。但是患者自己往往不覺鼻內有臭。這是因為患病日久。鼻腔的嗅覺神經。已經失去嗅覺作用的緣故。（待續）</p>

<p>— 李興</p>
<p>燙燒傷部分大的是非常的疼痛醫師必須為受傷者止痛。當痛極時注射嗎啡是止痛最靈的辦法。但宜注意嗎啡不可注射太多。嗎啡除止痛作用外也叫人惡心嘔吐。須知受燙燒傷的必須喝下大量流質。如果因嗎啡惡心嘔吐作用而流質不能下嚥或下嚥後嘔出，身體因得不到大量水分也要發生性命危險。所以最好就是注射少許嗎啡使受傷者受一部分安慰，也少許忍受一些疼痛。這是較安全的辦法。除了注射嗎啡以外正當的治法也是可以止住大部分疼痛的。數寸以內大小面積的燙燒傷可外擦疋克酸水。此藥有局部止痛，消毒，沉澱蛋白質的作用可使傷處先成一臨時皮。若身體一大部分受燙燒傷不宜用此藥因用此藥過多有毒。大傷宜用鞣酸水噴。傷部蛋白質可以凝結變成一種臨時皮。神經接觸器少受激刺，疼痛就可减去十之八九。要免去後來的痛須免去傷處潰爛因為潰爛了疼痛就要長久。要免去潰爛發炎當於傷後用消毒藥水將傷處洗爭，爛肉剪去，後照上法擦藥。</p>
<p>第二個大問題是免去性命危險。治療得當可以起死回生，治療不得當不該死的也要死。重燙燒後發生性命危險有幾個大原因。知逍了這些原因，用合理性的治療法可减少很多的危險。燙燒後第一個大危險就是傷處流出大量的血淸，使身內血內水分减少致血液濃度增高，由血濃度增高，血流就要停滯便可致傷者於死。補救的方法是：（一）用以上的治燙傷法，使傷處先成臨時皮，免失落身內血淸。（二）加增身內水分。一補充身內失落水分不使血液濃度增高，帮助排洩身內毒質。加增水分方法：（一）加增飮料，傷者宜多飮水，水果汁，任何流質，傷重的二十四小時內宜飲流質十至十五磅之多，因傷重的身體大約需要這麽些流質。由口不能得到大量流質時宜外加靜脈注射右轉糖水，或肌肉注射生理鹽水，或直腸內滴水，或以上數法同時實行。</p>
<p>第二件急務是减去血中毒。査血中毒是由於燙燒壞分解的皮肉蛋白質被吸入血內，血內毒質增多足以致傷者於死。减少血中毒第一是不使傷處毒質吸入血內。以上兩種藥水作用是沉澱破壞分解的毒蛋白質，毒蛋白質一經沉澱了就不能入血，如此危險也可减少了。第二要帮助血中毒質快快排洩出去。要帮助排洩必先加增身內流質循環，加增尿量使大量毒質由腎排出。健全皮膚宜使溫暖，少出汗也好。其次疏通大便也有相當益處。</p>
<p>第三急務是急救昏絕。方法是注射少許嗎啡止痛，注射强心劑以挽救衰竭。使傷者身體溫暖。末了要緊的事是採用科學醫學的滅菌消毒治法以免去傷後潰爛發炎。注意不用滅菌消毒的治法是很容易潰爛發炎的，最終或可致傷者於死。</p>
<h3 id="c178">急性乳房炎 <a href="#c178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>婦女於乳養嬰兒期間，往往發生急性乳房炎。這也是一種很疼痛的毛病。養過兒女的婦人遭遇這種痛苦的是非常的多。在較大的醫院中每日可以看見這種病人求診。茲略述此病之原因，預防，止痛，治療以供讀者參考。</p>
<p>急性乳房炎一發作患處就要疼痛。當發炎的初起治療得當可以轉危為安，治療不得當急性發炎後患處就要潰爛成為慢性乳房炎。生急性乳房炎的原因常是身體不健壯貧血的婦女乳頭破裂或乳頭生瘡病菌得以侵入乳部深處而引起急性發炎。注意乳部受傷也是一種很重要的原因。生乳的期間乳房多是重大下垂，如於乳滿時快跑震動很可以叫乳部受傷，就是輕輕碰撞也可以引起這種毛病。乳房的構造是一大部分脂肪組織中雜生乳細胞與一些結締組織。這一類組織抵抗病菌的力量很弱，故易發生大膿腫，並且於潰爛後醫好也很慢。</p>
<p>急性乳房炎一起頭發炎處就腫脹同時也猛烈疼痛，身體也發熱發冷。因疼痛難忍喂乳艱難或因腫脹乳管阻寨，發炎疼痛又加上乳脹疼痛便是火上加油，患者就寢食難安。如此經數日疼痛後多半就要化膿。起初治療得當很有機會漸漸消腫全痊，若任憑自然不求醫治有時患處潰爛收口不易。</p>
<p>治療最高的目的是止痛與消炎退腫兩樣同時都能得到。要達到這種目的必須明白病理與用合理性的治鐵法。發炎初起要止痛消腫第一急務卽使乳部休息。休息也是消炎止痛的第一秘决，無論用於身體任何部分發炎是沒有不合宜的。須知乳房的位置是下垂，時時隨身體移動而擺動。若是任憑自然擺動乳房當然不能休息。要使發炎的乳房休息很簡單的法子就是將乳房托起或用綳帶包起使乳房不隨身體移動而擺動。與發炎乳房同邊的臂也當包住使不能動，因為臂動乳房底的肌肉也要隨動。這些肌肉不動了乳房就可完全休息了。照上法行若再加上臥床休息當然是更好。除了休息以外用熱力，如熱濕墊敷法一日三次也是於止痛消腫有很大功效的。此種熱力加於發炎部分能使血管張大，故可减少發炎的緊張，疼痛也可减去大半。由血流站加也可使毒質多被排洩出去，腫脹也有機會早日消去。還有一伴與消腫止痛有很大助力的是時將發炎乳房內乳抽出。法卽用拍乳器一日數次將乳抽去使乳房沒有集乳。這樣止痛的效力也不小。用以上各法外若再在患處敷以貝拉當那藥膏也與消炎止痛有些好處。至於我國人於乳房發生膿腫時祗知貼膏藥而希望消炎退腫。由這種辦法當然不能得到美滿的結果是無疑意的。</p>
<p>雖實行以上各法有時還免不了成膿腫。發炎於有膿現象時宜動外科手術將膿放出。膿出淸後就可漸漸全痊。開刀時用麻藥或蒙藥可以免去疼痛。假設怕痛不要開刀膿腫多日後常會自行潰爛。潰爛後再治療就不大容易，至少要多受幾個月痛苦，並且身體也要受很大的損害。</p>
<p>要免去乳房炎的痛苦，乳養嬰兒的婦女須預防乳房炎。預防的方法約而言之如下：（一）乳養嬰兒的婦女務注意勿使乳房受傷。使乳房受傷的如咬傷，碰傷，擊傷，急跑等務避免。（二）乳房外有小瘡或破裂的宜用消毒法卽早治好免引起乳房炎。（三）乳部稍腫痛卽當照以上各法治療。</p>

<p>第二編　淋病</p>
<p>第三章　淋病之傳染</p>
<p>淋病為一種傳染性疾患。其感染之必要條件。病原為體卽淋菌之存在</p>
<p>淋菌之感染。大都由於男女間之性交。其他手指，浴塲，布巾及其他用具等之間接傳染。僅於發育尙未完成之幼女見之。</p>
<p>至其傳染之機轉。在男子。則以陰莖勃起之結果。使尿道口開張。而遂淋菌以隨淋性分泌物傳入之機。且以經性交射精之後。其勃起之陰莖。驟然縮小。故有如抽氣筒之作用。使淋菌易隨分泌物而吸入於尿道內也。</p>
<p>淋菌威染之程度。依種種情形而不同。畸形尿道。例如上裂尿道，下裂尿道。當較正常者為易。而性交直後之放尿及陰部洗滌。則其感染可較少也。此外與個人之性質與環境亦有關係存焉。</p>
<p>女子之慢性淋病。其平時之分泌物中。淋菌之留存極少。傳染性有不甚著明者。然以過度性交，月經來潮，引起生殖器充血。使淋菌急激增加。故往往同一對方。僅於數次後方行傳染者。卽此理也</p>
<p>淋菌之感染。初在尿道之最前部。故易受殺菌劑之作用。翌日。卽漸向全體尿道粘膜下擴張。更侵及內在的組織。此時。殺菌劑之投與時奏效較難。故一染淋病。卽當求治於醫師。否則。星星之火。將至燎原而不可遏。</p>
<p>第四章　有關淋病之男女泌尿生殖器解剖大要</p>

<p>乙，舟狀窩（Fossa　naviculari）頗廣。其陷凹之狀如舟。</p>
<p>丙，海綿體部（Pars　cavernosa）圍繞尿道之海綿樣組織也。</p>
<p>丁，球部（Par　bulosa）在尿道海綿體之最後部。有多數之粘膜凹窩。曰麻根氏窩（Morgangniscbe　Lacune）。此外尙有平等分佈於尿道粘膜之腺體（列氏腺（LittrescheDruesen）及柯氏腺（Cowpersche　Drueesn）之開口處。</p>
<p>戊，膜樣部（Pars　membranacea）為尿道中最狹小之部份。其周圍有强靭之橫紋筋纖維作輪狀環繞之,曰外括約筋（Musoulns　sphincter　externus）</p>

<h3 id="c181">去年米麥粉出納之狀况 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 柳塘</p>
<p>去年此時，正旱災進行日漸嚴重之時，人心皇，以為明年此時，米價不知貴至如何地步，而至今年此時，米價固貴，但無去年此時豫想之甚，此其故何歟？無可相求，而求之於海關報吿中一部分之數字，推測一斑。</p>
<p>査去年進口之洋米為七百七十一萬六百十公擔，前年則有一千二百九十五萬四千零一公擔，减少五百二十四萬三千三百九十一公擔，若以值言之，則减少百分之五十六。小麥進口四百六十四萬九千四百十九公擔，前年則有一千七十一萬四千六百三十四公擔，亦减少六百零六萬五千二百十五公擔，價値减少百分之六十四。麵粉進口五十九萬五千七百四十八公擔，前年則有一百九十五萬七千一百十三公擔，計少一百三十六萬一千三百軣十五公擔。價值亦少百分之七十四。此其减少之由來，（一）應認請在去年六月以前，產米省分，猶是函電紛馳，正謀救濟榖賤傷農之辦法，則食糧似有過剩之狀，而無不足之虞。（二）去年縱旱，而其影響應在今年，蓋當年食糧，如前兩年為豐收，不至有何不足。（三）去年雖旱，北方收成尙好，即南方如浙之甌海，以及閩粵各地，均吿豐登。而洞庭湖圩田收成，亦頗不惡，江蘇除絕少數縣分受災稍重外，餘亦有秋。受災獨重者為浙江一省，七十五縣之中，災者七十二縣，次之當推皖南也。（四）連年農產物跌價。農民經濟枯窘已極，　飧不給，是其常事，番薯之屬，巳為農民最上食品，其下焉者更不堪問。則米麥麵粉之銷路，安得而不减少。（五）自前年十二月十六日進口米麥　稅，麵粉加稅之後，亦不無為進口减少之一因，但其為效尙微，蓋洋米不論我國糧價賤至如何地步而彼仍有輸入也可知</p>
<p>再一觀去年進口米，麥，粉，之內容，米則幾全來自暹羅安南兩地，蓋進口米榖七百七十一萬公擔，中暹米有三百四十五萬公擔，安南米有三百四十二萬公擔，餘則日鮮皆有，而以緬甸進口之六十四萬公擔為最大也。小麥進口共為四百六十四萬九千公擔。美麥占有三百零八萬六千公擔，此數字中除去十八萬一千公擔，係為商人定購者外，餘皆為棉麥借欵而輸入者也。加以江淮麥收豐穰，因之澳洲阿根廷小麥，輸入大减，阿麥在前年進口有一百三十四萬四千公擔，去年祗九十七萬公擔；澳麥所减更巨，前年有八百三十九萬五千擔，去年祗四十三萬公擔。麵粉亦以美國來者居多，有三十五萬五千公擔，一部分固亦為借欵也。加拿大粉則有十萬九千公擔，澳洲粉十一萬九千公擔，日本粉亦有九千八百公擔。至輸出外洋之米，共有六萬八千二百八十九公擔，運往關東租借地者四萬六千公擔，香港者一萬四千公擔，此外日本，美國英國各有一二千擔。運往外國之小麥有十三萬二千六百六十四公擔。而有十二萬二千九百七十七公擔運往日本。麵粉運往外洋六萬四千五百七十二公擔中，運往關東租借地即有五萬餘公擔，其餘則為菲列濱香港遝去矣。茲列表於下；（本文所有各表單位，俱為公擔，舊時之關平百斤，合·六〇五公擔）。</p>
<p>民國二十三年米·麥·粉，對外輸出入數量表</p>
<p>以上所云，僅其大綱，猶不能明白此大宗進口食糧，銷納於何地；又國內糧食流通，其情形為若何，雖海關報吿冊所列者，能得全國糧產數字幾分之幾，無從臆測。但經輪運者已大概在內，較之一般憑空臆測為可信，故為之分類整理，重行編製，而得後列米榖，小麥，麵粉，三表。得此三表，對於各該地食糧出納狀况，多少得有一點印象；即欲知其為有餘，為不足，亦不難加减便得。就表以觀，本國之米，以應本國之需，相越尙鉅。小麥則去年江北豐收，確為事實，要知江北皖北之麥，車運居多，然由鎭江南京兩地輸運出口者已有五十四萬三千公担，蕪湖有十五萬二千公担，則其出口數之鉅可知，但以之應國內需要，相差猶遠。麵粉則以本廠勢力為大，洋粉為不足道。上海　地，去年本廠粉出口，已有五百六十二萬七千公担，河北一區，進口有三百零二萬九千公担。即如去年進口洋粉，亦可謂銷於滬粵兩地，餘則寥寥。機製麵粉業自結束以來，嶄然露頭角，若能善為經營，何至尙有洋粉輸入耶！三表列後：</p>
<p>一　米榖</p>
<p>二　小麥</p>
<p>三　麵粉</p>
<p>本文不能多所論述，實為本刊地位所不許。惟附帶聲明者，文中所稱之去年，即民國二十三年，前年即民國二十二年也·再馮海關數字作研究資料，以運輸工具之改變，如鐵道公路開闢日多，貨物不經海關者亦必漸衆，則如何使研究者得有比較充分可靠之數字，是則所望於有責者也。</p>
<h3 id="c182">世界金產額與金準備 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 姚方仁</p>
<p>金本位制在一九三一年以前曾廣泛地施行於各國，差不多成為貨幣用金唯一之代表者。時至今日，於安定通貨底前提之下，金本位恢復說，又為一般經濟學者所樂道。對於這個問題的確切解答，自然並非簡單；不過要明瞭金本位再建之基礎，是依存於各國通貨之新平價的努力程度如何而後定·假若金鎊，金元，法郎之金的含有量在一九三一年以前為六成或五成的話，則金之一定量的貨幣價格在比例上必然增加；又如中央銀行之金準備率由四成降低至二成五的時候，金準備額的價格將更提高。在這裏有幾點是不能明白，就是將來的金保有額，或在某種限度以內作為金準備之保有實額如何，誰也不敢逆料，這是隨着各國本身的意向得以伸縮。</p>
<p>金集團與鎊集團</p>
<p>貨幣用金的實額及其分佈，我們首先不得不加以考究。關於道一點國際淸算銀行第五回年報可以供給，我們一些資料。該年報將世界各國的貨幣情形，割成了兩個陣壘；就是金集團與鎊集團。前者除法國，荷蘭，意大利，波蘭，及瑞士之外，尙包含有阿爾巴尼亞，比利時，布加利亞，古巴，捷克斯洛佛克，但澤，德意志，希臘，巨哥斯拉夫，拉晚維亞，里薩尼亞，墨西哥，羅馬尼亞，西班牙，土耳其，北美合衆國以及島拉圭等，後者則包含有阿根廷，澳洲，玻利維亞，巴西，哥倫比亞，丹麥，埃及，愛沙尼亞，芬蘭，英國，印度，愛爾蘭自由國，日本，挪威，紐絲綸，巴拉圭，葡萄牙，暹羅，海峽殖民地，瑞典，南非聯邦，以及英領殖民地等。原來金集團各國亦不一定完全將通貨封鎖而與鎊集團各國間有十分顯著的區別·這樣分類祗不過為便於叙述而已。</p>
<p>金之供給</p>
<p>次就金之供給問題加以檢討；一九二九年以來金鎊及金元同樣受到價値低落之刺激，同時又以加拿大及蘇俄金產之增加，世界金產額有如下表之激增。（單位千盎斯）</p>

<p>上表中「其他各國」之增產，大半可歸之於澳洲。就價格方面而言，一九三四年之金產額為二十九億四百萬瑞士法郎。此外遠東各國之「私藏金」亦同時流出。其推定額有如次表（單位百萬瑞士法郎）</p>

<p>總計　二、八四七　三〇〇　二九〇　三、四三七</p>
<p>一九三一年以後金流出額漸見减退；然過去四年間金流出額遠過於世界全年金產之總額。國際淸算銀行將美國，意大利，及英國用作工藝方面的金貨收回額推算在內；從而只能把新產金及遠東各國之私藏金流出額的全部足以充當金準備及歐洲各國全部之「新私藏」。</p>
<p>貨幣用金的需要</p>
<p>年報中復有述及貨幣用金的需要，一九三四年新產金額殆為二十九億四百萬瑞士法郎，遠東各國藏金流出額為八億七千五百萬瑞士法郎（此額與前表相差五千萬瑞士法郎，在年報中未曾說明），能用作通貨準備之金額約在三十七億七千九百萬瑞士法郎以上。對此，五十個國家「公表」之金準備額四十八億三千四百萬瑞士法郎。較之於供給額超過五千五百萬瑞士法郎，此差額之一部分乃由於各種滙兌平衡未曾「公表」，特別是一九三四年中英滙兌基金的一部分是被抹煞了。</p>

<p>一九三四年法國金的保有額是增加了，這大部由於金築團各國的流入。本年度第一季法國金額亦略見增加，全集團各國則復見减少。然本年三月末迄今法蘭西銀行存金减少十一億瑞士法郎，同時美國却有顯著之增加，法美兩國現在保有世界貨幣金公表額約為三分之二。</p>

<p>「給它公表出來」這一制限，在目前是必要的。這可以說有兩種理由：第一是因為英美以及其他各國的滙兌平衡資金究竟它們底保有額多少，外人英明其妙，年報所載一九三三年英美兩國的滙兌平衡資金只說到有巨額之買進，前年的年報載收進私藏額大槪為三十億一千二百萬瑞士法郎，今年年報復載是項滙兌平衡基金之取得額殆與私藏額三十億瑞士法郎無甚出入。然而於一九三四年英國的平衡基金的保有額漸見減少。其中一部分因為從倫教流出國外資金之增長，再以英國一部分資金之流出為鎊集國際貸借之支付。</p>
<p>使用「公表」這一術語的第二理由是因為私藏額之存在。這些私藏額不僅是足以惹起恐慌，而且對於金之世界的分配上陷於極大的困難，使人無從計算。不得不用金元及金磅來做生意的大公司憂慮着匯兌的暴落而保有金額，故時至今日金實為决定滙兌上落之最有權威。雖然把私藏金一部分加以分柝起來也有作為實際上作為國際貿易的資金使用著的，但這是例外，當不乏以前的一般情形中，未之多覯。</p>
<p>私藏金額</p>
<p>國際淸算銀行年報曾有一九三四年末之金私藏額的估計。自一九三零年一九三四年未的金新產額及遠東各國的金之流出額，約在一百五十億瑞士法郎之上。其間世界的金準備額約增加百億瑞士法郎。金貨的退藏，工藝用金的消費，匯兌平衡資金的買進以及一九三一年以前之私藏額等加以研究，一九三四年末私藏金額當可推算為七十億瑞士法郎，其中十八億瑞士法郎屬於英格蘭銀行之金準備額，餘則未詳，大部分總是屬於匯兌平衡資金方面的，或已登入外國中央銀行之帳目中。這些私藏金的保有額，除去印度中國及埃及的私藏金額之外，其中約半數為倫敦所保管。這大量的私藏金以美國來說，均退藏在裏面以作金準備。假如一旦通貨安定，市面平穩的話，則私藏之在部分可以流出來，將為中央銀行的準備金。因此對於這一點可由其本身來决定，此種事實就是表示得以避免將來貨幣用金缺乏的恐慌。</p>
<p>金之再公佈</p>
<p>復次，說到金之再分佈問題。英美兩國直到現在還是保有着世界貨幣用金之巨大數量。首先，私藏金是要流進那弱小的中央銀行的，這是因為私藏金的大部分是從那裏流出來的緣故。至於那些弱小的中央銀行之能否繼續保管則又是後起的問題。這完全要看通貨的安定，金本位再建之方法如何而後定。若各國通貨同時得現均衡，則國際通商，投資，以及金融回復寬鬆，各國自然相應而起需要那私金以維持金準備，如果這個條件具備了的話，那麽此後各地藏金仍然可以向金融集中市塲流出，而對於別一部分的金貨失去了相當的活動力，對於最新型的金本位制遲早總有被拋棄的一天。</p>

<h3 id="c187">槎菴小乘 <a href="#c187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— 寒峰</p>
<p>—幾種小說的考證</p>
<p>五月下旬，杭書商某以大批舊籍來滬求售，我和大杰獨愛甚槎菴小乘」。我巳經窮窘到不能應付生活，對此珍本，根本上是不敢作任何想念。大杰也很拮据，幾次翻開書，幾次的搖頭歎氣，頗有欲買不能之感。幾天之後，再遇大杰，他竟很高興的吿訴我，此書到底給他買下了，因為那書商同意他分期付錢的辦法。而我，也就因此有了一讀的機會，並寫這一篇讀書的小文。</p>
<p>「槎菴小乘」是很少見的，凡四十一卷，來斯行著，是一部分類的小考據書，也可以說是筆記之類，崇禎辛未年刊本。其伯子序言謂，此書之作，一始於萬歷葵巳，竣於辛未，幾四十年，凡五易稿而就緒」。其內容是「上自天文地理，國事掌故，及師旅刑獄，旁及冠冕形體，姓氏名諱，喪祭音樂，　釋草木，鳥獸夷狄之類」。共約一千則。</p>
<p>其間也有許多是精力的浪費，如「馬」一則，把黃帝以來名人所畜的馬的名字全部輯錄，如「狗」一則，開了不知多少古來的狗名，時間化得多，却並無意義可言。但大部分却是很好的資料書，有不少的珍貴材料。近來的興味，頗集中於小說，在這里，祇想說一點關於涉及小說中人物部分的話。</p>
<p>小說考證部分最主要的，要算『張順」一條，此對於「水滸」的關係很大，其文為：「水滸傳有張順者，混名浪里白跳，善水，以為水軍帥。癸辛雜志：襄樊之圍，孤城困守，凡三四歲。張漢莫守樊城，重賞募死士，得　悍三千人，求將久之，得民兵部官張順張貴，所謂大張都統小張都統者，其智勇素為諸軍所服。先於均州上流，名中水峪，立硬寨，造水哨，輕舟百艘，每艘三十人。鹽一袋，布二百，且令之曰：此行有死而已，或非本心，亟去，母敗吾事。人人感激思憤，乘風破浪，徑犯重園，賊兵皆披靡。襄城中聞救至，勇氣百倍。及收軍而失順。數日，有浮屍逆流而上，被甲胃，執弓矢，直抵浮梁，視之，順也。身中四槍六箭，怒氣勃勃如生。軍中驚以為神，立廟祀之。張貴後被獲，不屈死。呂文煥為立雙廟。比巡遠云，則順固能水者，但非宣和間人也。今武林湧金門內，有金華將軍廟者，曹果，後唐人，為金華令，以討平叛者，吳越入朝，委以國事，即城隅，浚三池，引湖水入城。王歸嘉之，題曰湧金。杲卒，郡人祀之，稱金華將軍，以為即張順誤。水滸傳載宋江往李師師家，道君至，匿於床下，是周成美事，見張端義貴耳集」。此可見水滸傳中張順兄弟的來歷，及宋江至李師師家事實的依據，水游人物的搆成，實取之於三朝。</p>
<p>其次為「韓湘」，即八仙中之韓湘子。作者據昌黎集，靑瑣高議，僊傳拾遺，酉陽雜俎四書，引述韓湘軼事，大都彷彿。惟有云湘是昌黎「疎從子　」，有云是「外甥」，殊不一。靑瑣高議云：「湘字靑夫，公姪也，落魄不覇，公勉之學，乃笑作詩，有能開頃刻花之句。公曰，汝能奪造化開花乎？湘遂聚土覆盆，良久，曰花巳發矣。舉盆，乃碧花二朶，葉間有小金字，乃雲橫秦嶺十四字。湘曰：事久可騐。公後貶潮陽，途有一人冒雪而來，乃湘也。湘曰。。公憶花句乎？公詢地名，即藍關也。再三噓歎，遂成一律，不言湘為姪孫」。僊傳拾遺，則謂其能染花色，西陽雜俎亦同。雜俎叙其染花經過云：「乃豎箔曲尺，遮壯丹叢，不令人窺。掘窠四面，深及其根，寬容人座，惟賚紫鑛輕粉朱紅，且暮治其根，凡七月，乃塡坑」。比較近理。昌黎集，不過藉「左遜到藍關示姪孫湘詩，以說及韓湘而已。有明刊「韓湘子」書，未見，不知曾否說及此事也。</p>
<p>又「梁山伯祝英臺」小考云：「俗傳染山伯祝英台事，不知所出。寗波府志，府城西有義婦墓，云梁祝二人少同學，梁不知祝乃女子。後梁為鄞令，卒葬此。祝氏弔墓下，墓裂而殞，遂同葬謝安奏封義婦塚，則事當在東晋時，而宜興縣志，有祝英臺宅。山東膠州志，州南百里許，有祝英台墓，今上虞亦有梁山伯墓，或傳者之誤耳」。所記本事，大體為吾人所耳能熟者，地點時記錄則殊可貴。</p>
<p>關於傳奇者，有「貂蟬」篇，引三國志注布妻之諫，疑所謂「布妻」或即貂蟬。又據淮安志：「邳州有梳妝台，在古下祁城中，相傳呂布罷姬貂蟬，梳妝於此，遺址尙存」。史無可考，「貂蟬之名，僅見於此，則傳奇之言，未為無本，但其為妻與姬侍，未可知耳」。有「昭君」篇係輯引前漢書匈奴傳，後漢書南匈奴傳，西京雜記之書所記昭君事，加以比較研究。以「四施」考證為最詳：</p>
<p>「吳越春秋，越王得苧蘿山　薪之女，日西施鄭旦，飾以羅　，敎以容步，習於土城，臨於都漢，三年學服，而默於吳。王子年拾遺記：越謀滅吳，有美女二人，一名夷光，一名修明，以貢於吳，則西施固名夷光也，本施姓，以居在西，因日西施。然孟子直曰西子。國策云：毛　先施。枚乘七發云：使先施陽文，　服而御，則西施又為先施，以先西字同母，相傳之訛，似乎以西為姓。東坡云：儂家舊姓西，似非誤耳。吳亡，西施未知所終。杜牧之詩，西子下姑蘇，一柯逐鴟夷。宋之問：一朝還舊都，靚妝尋若耶。墨子云：西施之沉其美也，竟無所據。吳越春秋：吳亡，西子被殺。今紹興府城外，有西施墓，理或近之。孟子注統，引史記云。。西施越之美女。越王勾踐，以獻之吳王夫差，大幸之。每入市，人願見者，先輸金錢一文。今史記無此語。管子小稱篇：毛墻西施，天下之美人也，盛怒氣於面，不能以為可好。管子先越王二百餘年，豈古人曾有此名，而越女因之，或管子為贋書耶？西施逐　夷事，歸客叢書，藝林伐山，藝苑巵言，陳氏正榴，胡氏學山，辨之甚悉，不具載。太平廣記三百二十六卷，載梁天監十一年七月，沛國劉導，與同志李士烟，在京口，解后二人，一為西施，一為夷光。中云，夷光是越王之女，與施同貢於吳，事雖淫　不足述，然亦足微其為二人，不得以西施名夷光也。一云，鄭旦即西施名。又越絕書：勾踐入臣於吳，夫人道中產一女於亭中，後勝吳，名亭曰女隅，更就李為女兒鄉。陸廣微吳地記：以為范　西施事誤。漢書南越傳：轅終古封語兒鄉侯，注語字或作　亦作　今名語溪，又未必以女兒也。西施實生於吾蕭，今蕭山有苧蘿鄕。後漢書：會稽餘曁，即蕭山，注西施之所出，以為諸曁者誤」。</p>
<p>此考甚是淵博。記得「一二八」以後，頗有人以「西施」作題材寫戲劇，小說，時報並有諸曁遊記，刋西施遺蹟照片，若據此記，則是誤矣。尙有「潤筆」一則，實是「稿費」考，「潤筆之事，自魏晋以來有之，而八盛於唐。張燕公為姚相碑，收其珍玩不貲，而韓昌黎至車馬使樂，動以千百計，當時遂有　墓獲金之議。而後草制除官，自給諫侍制以上，皆有潤筆物。宋太宗時，立潤筆錢，數降詔，刻石於舍人院，每除官，則移文督之。在院官，下至吏人院騶，皆分沾，後時者必遺院子詣門催索，素者送者，恬然不以為怪。國朝初時未聞，近時直制誥者，稍有酬謝，京官不過二幣，多辭不受。外州縣正官漸有定額，然亦不聞誦言之。而平居丐文，益屬簡略，銘志碑碣，始得常格儉讓之聞，較之唐宋，大不侔矣」。古來賣稿生活情形，得以見之，明以後，不知有人考得否？</p>
<p>摘記關於小說者數事於右，以供小說研究者之採擇。而「槎菴小乘」內容，亦得槪見。似此專著作，可謂淵博至極，所云四十年始獲成稿，當是實在情形。吾甚明，大杰能設法標點重印，此書難得，其有關學術，當不淺也。</p>
<h3 id="c188">阿金一家兒病了 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 朱茭陽</p>
<p>阿金一家兒都跑到田間去，蒔秧，拔草，裝水車打水。一個新產的嬰孩，穩穩地放在田岸上，給炙烈的太陽光　着，野風吹着，黃瘦的臉上沒有絲毫血色。</p>
<p>他們沒有牛，沒有打水機，人就做牛，做機器；力氣來不及，拚了命做。渴了，捧那河裏混濁的冷水喝着，隨意咬着從街上買來的爛桃子。想不到走進典當，想不到出重利向人借貸，生活還安穩。</p>
<p>拚了命蒔秧，拔草，打水，皮膚炙得黧黑，整天流着臭汗。夜裏宿在充滿着霉氣，潮濕的草屋裏，裸着身體兩三人合睡着一張破門做的臥具，沒有被兒蓋，蚊蟲結着隊伍來咬。白天工作乏了力的阿金一家兒到沉沉地睡去，像是死了。等到天色黎明，下肢沉重　，似鉛鑄的脚，有病的現象。</p>
<p>阿金醒了，望着面靑靑的天空，一點沒有雨意，他硬着頭皮喊　他的老娘和妻兒，一家兒進　　向田間去做着工作。</p>
<p>，拔取，打水，一點沒有動兒。</p>
<p>太陽直　着他們的身體，奧　　　　從皮　孔內　出來，越做越有勁，病象沒有了。</p>
<p>他們天天這樣，身體很好！</p>
<p>旱的危險，已在阿金一家兒的想像中了，尤其阿金個人頂着急。</p>
<p>希望却來了！天色漸漸呈着陰　的狀態，不久就下雨了，而且過於他們需要的雨水之外。他們快活極了，一家兒都舒舒適適地休息下來。</p>
<p>雨聲潺潺，下個不了，阿金夜裏好像患着失眠症似的，反而睡不着，他在想明天的工作和消遣。想到天明，得到一個决定：</p>
<p>到鎮上去混一天！</p>
<p>吃過泡飯粥，阿金帶了十歲光景的孩子，頭上各戴了一頂　　，撐了一條船，船裏放着兩石白米兩隻採菱桶，冒着雨一逕搖到鎭上。</p>
<p>阿金把米和採菱桶搬進典當棧房，兩石米和採菱桶一共質當約來十多塊錢。匆匆地帶了孩子踏進小飯館，暢快地吃一飽酒肉飯。</p>
<p>下半天沒事做，阿金和孩子踏進老姜的家裏打牌消遣。他的孩子站在旁邊頻頻催着回去。半天工夫，那質當下來的錢，只一　午飯搶　快好像吃的白食，其餘的錢，都被這窮運支配着的阿金輸入他人的袋裏了，幸而還留剩一卷銅元。</p>
<p>阿金呆呆地帶着孩子跨出老姜的大門，念頭似風車旋轉着，橫字當着頭，如果有機會，再想去翻本。他一路走近水菓攤，把這一卷銅元買了一籃　桃子，預備回去騙騙他的老娘和妻兒。</p>

<h3 id="c189">寂寞 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 卷葹</p>
<p>我正在提起筆預備在這紙上寫下一些什麽，忽然從窗口飄進一陣蝙蝠似的風，把紙吹起來，飄到茶盃上，桌上，牀上，終於落在地板上。在這紙片的漂流期間，我並沒給以任何的援助，假如牠會說話的話，應當像我們的藝術家那樣用一打以上的感嘆符號來表示他的怨咀了吧！現在牠是靜靜地伏在我的腕下，等待黑的筆尖在牠面上塗抹一些不可知的字句。本來沒有思緒的我，却也因為鐵紙片不平凡的遭遇引起一些感想來。並不是想到自己連年的漂泊，更不願去咀咒那不可抗拒的為一般人所不相信的命運，我是在思索，如果凑巧這風不吹進屋來或吹進來而紙片不曾落地的話，那麽這小小的方格之中現在已裝滿了許多另外的字句了吧？這思想是如此奇特，竟引得我握着鋼筆的手漸漸顫動，而終於在面頰形成兩絲似笑非笑的紋絡來。</p>
<p>僅僅在一二分鐘以前，自己還在支着頥，凝着眼神，思索一些文藝上的問題；而現在，代巷這而蜿蜓入我腦際的，是一種略帶虛無傾向的寂寞與悒鬱，這使我想把筆桿放下。</p>
<p>無論是怎樣歡迎熱鬧的人，在他生活中，總有一個機會輪到他感到寂寞的重壓的。這說起來雖然有些可笑，然而和世界上許多事物一樣平凡無奇。在出着太陽的時候降下幾滴梅雨，燈紅酒綠的筵席間聽到商婦的嚶嚶啜泣，往往會使人起一種極平淡的感覺，這眞是個可驚的發現。以我自己而論，有時也無聊地張着嘴笑笑的，可是當酒闌人散，斗室獨處的時候，不知從何而來的一股岑寂滋味便在心府慢慢滋長起來。黃昏，深夜，淡淡的微晨，淸靜無人的日午，都是使我感到岑寂的時候；寂寞是個不可思議的幽靈，其來也無聲，其去也無影，往往是我剛剛提起筆桿，剛剛翻開一本道貌儼然的書預備開始誦讀，剛想動手去撚開那凄黯的燈，剛剛為春花春草的媚色所鼓舞的時候，不知怎麽，在衫子下的一顆心上，巳經重重地蒙上一層如綃如霧的陰雲。想撕，撕不掉，若由牠去，那景况也眞難握。於是就頭重脚輕地往下沉，沉，等到你開始意識到自己是在寂寞，而預備試着去捕捉它整個姿態而加以精密的諦視時，牠往往是一溜烟似地滑脫走遠了。那麼你會恍然大悟地說：嘿！簡直是個夢！</p>
<p>夢！不錯！在寂寞中我們會想到與自己疏遠的東西，那和夢游就沒有兩樣。記得自己最初領略寂寞滋味，是還住在北平—那時還是北京—的一個晚上，年紀不到十歲，站在生滿了蒼苔和枯草的皇城根下遙看那欲落未落的太陽，這太陽愈現愈大，愈現愈紅，終乃消失於一片民房的灰瓦裏，從城脚又飄起幾陣幽咽的軍號聲，於是天色就漸漸地暗下來，暗下來，歸巢的島鴉成千成百地在我頭上打盤旋，我還是立着不動；慢慢看着洋車快絕跡了，看到一個傴僂的人從暮色中走來，咳嗽着爬上梯子去點那街牆上的三角油燈了，我纔想到回去，就在那一瞬間，這意稚的心底忽然感到一種難以言說的妻凉與寂寞，我不曉得應當怎樣來排遺那以後的時間。</p>
<p>近年因為生活忙迫的緣故，寂寞的時候總比較少，即有，也正如一個人跡罕至的廟宇，旣沒有什麽鐘磬的雅樂，又少着扶疏的花木，失去往昔那種詩的情趣了。現在我正面對着不十分亮的檯燈，市聲越過鄰家的屋頂向我窗內爬來，人非常淸明，我是在渴望着用汗來醫治自己，慢慢和寂寞疎遠了。</p>

<p>後來，到了彌海爾節木馬盤又裝設起來的時候，我還希望再遇目她一次。每天晚上天氣一黑，我便走到那個廣塲去，這使我的朋友弗里茨非常懊惱，因為我每次總假託辭擺晚了他。但在騎木馬的那些女孩子當中，我總沒有看見那個細長的褐色女孩；我正是為她而來的。我自一個人漫步穿過宮園花邸中黑暗蔭道，　　地咀嚼那業已飛逝的幸福底回憶</p>
<p>這件事情突然告了一個結束：這年初冬我遵從父親底意志離開本城文科中學，到德國中部一個實科中學裏讀書，以為舁入大學的準備。—我那個捕蝶機是不是還掛在荒原近旁那株開花的樹校上呢？—我不知道；我以後再沒有到那裏去過了；那個木備蝶我至今也還未曾捕捉着。</p>
<p>那時以後又過去幾年了。</p>
<p>那一年，我在那個佾院式學校畢業之後，才於初秋間回到故鄕住了幾個星期。我的那些老朋友裏頭，祇剩下一個克里斯羅夫還在舊巢中留着；其餘的人，連弗里茨在內，都飛向別處去了；他們或者過那有趣的大學生生活，或者遠渡重洋在海外謀生去，或者坐在某個商行底黑暗賬房裏面，總之都到自己選擇的或命運指使的地方去了。就是克里斯羅夫此時也長大變成一個矮胖而壯美的男子了，他正準備離開故鄕，因為他已經由學徒昇為夥計，必須出門游歷了。但是我們二人還得在他父親底作坊裏共同工作了一次，在大學時代跟在我身邊的那個烟盒子便是這次工作底成績。—我的母親吿訴我，那個結實的波力嘉太太已於一年前突然死去了，她的女兒不久便搬到本邦大學所在的那個小城，去和一個未曾結婚的老姨母同住！照　　規定，這老處女是她那份微少財產底總繼承人。門前有菩提樹的那個小屋，舟親在後就被變賣還債了；法國裁縫現在祇好在別的裁縫店裏充當一名夥計，聊以糊。某一星期日下午，我在敎堂院子角隅上遇見他，他正坐在長凳子上面。在他突出的兩頰骨上，皮膚愈加　黃了，他的黑頭髮也完全成為灰色了；他咳嗽着，太陽似乎晒得他舒服。「啊，菲力先生—他喊，他認出了我，他那瘦削的手用二個指頭向我仲來，其餘的指頭則緊握住那個人人熟　的瓷製鼻烟壺。『那個時候啊，—現在不像那個時候了，菲力先生！」他歎息着往下說。『　的老太婆帶了她的家計走到那邊黑十字架底下去了；說到女孩子，娜麗，』—他嗚咽了幾次並倒出一大堆鼻烟來—「你大概已經聽見說了！—她不願意，她不願意讓她的可憐的父親　獨生活着，我必須用力把她的手推開去。這有甚麽辦法呢！小孩子應該走她自己的幸福道的！」他垂下頭來，把雙手懶懶地放在膝蓋上。「我要把她寫的信　給你看！」他過一會又—，『你可以看見她是很有學問的！她寫的字好看得很，寫的話又都是很可愛的；一個候爵　人寫的也不過如此。」</p>

<p>（一）前部急性尿道淋，尿道有多量之膿汁排泄，小溲劇痛，陰莖間或腫脹，晚間有勃起之疼痛性，兼有併發鼠蹊腺炎，及陰莖背部之淋巴管炎，經過約三週後，疼痛減輕，膿流汁也漸減少</p>
<p>（二）急性後部尿道淋，由前道而移至後道，其排尿時，會陰部生劇痛，排尿垂有點滴血液，尿中亦見血液混合，假是鑑別，以玻璃二只，患者排一半之尿於第一杯，後一半之尿再排於第二杯，若第一杯呈混濁，第二杯透明，此證為前部尿道炎，倘是第一杯混濁濃厚，而第二杯混濁稍薄，此謂後部尿道炎</p>
<p>前後部尿道淋，於治療期間，而移為慢性前後部尿道淋者甚多，其於朝晨，見尿道口有粘液樣物封固，其他劇痛等癥消失，邊明之尿中稍存淋絲，若鑑別之，以二杯如法泡製，卽可明瞭，本症內服藥首推美靈洋行出品之滅殺淋，局部外用藥，以德國滿爾志混合淋苗淋毒舒樂　為最佳，該二藥均歸本埠法租界八仙橋　體　　路老德行裏一號仁壽西藥社經售前者每盆一元，後者每罐二元五角，郵購寄費加一。</p>

<p>— 瓊聲</p>
<p>近來意大利希圖征服阿比西尼亞的爭端，日形急迫，意國軍隊不斷的輸送到菲洲殖民地，阿國亦復整軍經武，為民族的獨立和生存，不辭一戰。這一種劍拔弩張的形勢，國聯如果眞是主張甚麽公理正義，問題的中心自然在如何以有效的辦法，來立卽阻止意大利的侵略野心，加以裁制，可是不然，它却裝聾賣啞，在那兒儘鬧着調解仲裁，敷衍行事。</p>
<p>當然，國聯之所以為國聯，它輕描淡寫的調解仲裁，自有其個中的道理，這道理就是這一不容易處决的難題，讓後臺老板去直接談判，或分贓，或决裂，可不用自己來理會。最近艾登訪羅馬後的「一籌莫展」，以及轟傳着的英法意聯合陣綫的破裂，就是這幾個首腦部講經頭不平的吵鬧。所以倫敦傳來的消息有云：列強殊願瓜分阿國，以一部份作為意國之保護國，或以阿國分成若干勢力範圍，惟意國則不願接受任何和平解决之條件（一日電）。</p>
<p>帝國主義講價還價的生意經，自有其同床各夢的目標，雖不滿於意大利的獨吞，但在整個帝國主義的利益上說，就絕不願阿比西尼亞眞的鬧成民族獨立和解放的事實。因此在各國主張「和平」聲中，就有停止運輸軍器供給阿國的事伴發生。可是阿十與陸長發表談話說：阿國對於國聯會會員義務有何未盡之處，能有所指出否？各文明國雖不能制止戰禍，至少亦不當妨害阿國使之無從購置自衛工具。如意阿戰事爆發，最後雖餘一人一槍，亦必堅持到底。阿國以後的成收利鈍，姑可置之不談，但這樣的强毅勇住的氣概，已是令人五體投地，</p>

<p>— 勞心</p>
<p>每次到西江的上游時，老是經過河口這小市鎭，因為次數多了，和它的認識也漸次地和熟了。</p>
<p>有時因為車到的時候，不一定便立刻有船，所以很多時候經過這小市鎭時，都有一次短時間的逗留時。這，不單只是我這樣地對於這小市鎭的相熟，差不多每一個跑西江這一條水路的人都是這樣地和這小市鎭相熟的。同理，這小市鎭也是靠了我們這些旅客們的往來而繁榮的。</p>
<p>西江是頂有名的瘋狂的水，它是很多時候都在瘋狂般的泛濫的，差不多每年到了西水漲的時候，它便瘋狂了似的，捲起了無限的風雲而摧毀了這沿江一帶的小市鎭了。河口，這自然不會例外。不過，正因為西江是一條瘋狂的水，而人們都害怕了它，所以在廣州到河口這一段路便都改走了陸路而換乘火車，那才急速地把這一個不知名的小市鎭繁榮起來，因為大家都在這一段路改走了陸路了以後，無形中河口便成了一個必經的驛站了。</p>
<p>當你從『廣三車』走了出來的時候，沿着了車站的路跑，不用懷疑的，一直走着，你便會走到泊船的岸傍的。在沿路里，你會感覺到驚奇的便是有那無數的女子，在　着她們特有的一種尖銳的而又嬌滴滴的喉嗓，在向你招呼着著</p>
<p>「先生，肇慶渡呀！川點開。」</p>
<p>「梧州去呀，××快輪快要開了。」</p>
<p>『先生，駁輪呀！……』</p>
<p>這一派聲音會鑽到你的耳朶里。如　　爽快一點的話，你便可以叫了她們中間的一個，講定了用她們的艇子搬送了你出去那灣泊在海面上的悟州船或駁輪。你的行李便可以交給了她，一點也不用費到你的力。如果你是一個走慣了這條水路的話，你一直地走到岸傍去也沒要緊的。反正她們不會來搶你的東西，她們也不過是為了解决她們的生活而勞働吧。對於她們，一種初到廣東的人一定會奇怪，因為她們是野蠻人種之一咧，正如胡適之大博士所說的一樣。據無數民俗學者的研究所得，她們都是道道地地的野蠻人種。她們是生活在海面上的，她們的家便是那隻有蓬的小艇子，她們的名稱，在學名上是「蛋族」，而我們這帮人物却叫她們作『蛋家妹』的。她們跟碼頭脚夫一樣，是用她們的體力來換錢的。</p>
<p>河口這小市鎭是三水縣屬。因為它比較有點名字的緣故，很多人都會誤認它是三水縣城，其實三水縣城還在對海過去的蘆苞哩。這里有着無數的食物店，大概因為它的作用根本上是為了供給旅客用的吧，所以都很節單，但是却也很完備。當我每一次從廣州上，或者從肇慶回來也好，我也是照例逗留在這里　一些時侯的。</p>
<p>去年西水漲後，有一次我又從廣州到廣寗去了。當我從『廣三車』下了來之後，便覺得有點異樣。因為不特「蛋家妹」們少了，而且地方也荒漠得多。因此，我一路從車站走了出來，一路在懷疑着，看着車站上給水冲浸得剝蝕的痕跡，我像懷念着無限的感慨。到了岸傍，我還是依照着老例，在黎秀記魚生粥店那里坐着吃點東西。</p>
<p>『怎麽，今年很像冷落得很多咧？』</p>
<p>我帶着懷疑的音調問伙計們。他們答：</p>
<p>『唔，爛×的臭水，淹了來個十天八天，還不冷落。我們可以再次回來開店子已經幸運了。許多蛋家妹到了肇慶都不願回來了。年年如此，眞叫人沒辦法！……』</p>
<p>我帶着感傷的情緒離開了這個失去了一元氣的小市鎭。</p>
<p>今年，我再沒有機會走這一條水路了。現在從這距離了五日水程的大都市中又再次地看到了關於那條瘋狂的西江水在氾濫的消息，我又不禁想起了這還沒有恢復元氣的小市鎭。當我在靜夜里想起的時侯，我也喃喃地說着：</p>
<p>『年年如此，眞叫人沒辦法！』</p>

<p>培培給弄糊塗了；睜着大大的眼睛向着妹妹。半天，培培的眼淚不由自主的掉在妹妹的臉上，但他並不知道自己為什麼要哭。</p>
<p>「培培又惹了妹妹是不是？」</p>
<p>媽媽聽見了哭聲，從屋子裏趕了出來，</p>
<p>妹妹顧不得赤足，直奔了媽媽去；抓住了媽媽的衣服說：「媽……媽，姊姊……給…老虎…吞了！」邊說用小手指着天空。</p>
<p>媽媽笑了起來。</p>
<p>「誰說的？」</p>
<p>「哥哥說的·」</p>
<p>「培培，為什麽哄妹妹？」</p>
<p>我沒有哄她，剛才有一朶雲好像老虎的頭，又有一朵雲很像姊姊的臉，後來老虎頭衝散了姊姊的臉·我就說：「姊姊給老虎吞了·」妹妹就這樣哭了，」培培說着拍着小手大笑·</p>
<p>「小小乖，別哭，姊姊好好的在屋子裏呢·」</p>
<p>小小不相信，眼淚還從臉上掉下來。</p>
<p>「看，這不是姊姊來了，」培培跳着說。</p>
<p>小小從母親手中掙下了地，帶跌帶跑的迎上了姊姊。</p>
<p>「姊姊，你沒有給老虎拖了去？」</p>
<p>姊姊不明白她的話；祇問，「小小為什麼哭得這樣？」</p>
<p>母親告訴了她一切，姊姊好像那老虎頭眞要呑噬她的也想哭。</p>

<p>難為了周先生和胡女士</p>
<p>在麥金蘭號駛抵江海關碼頭的時候，岸上停滿了汽車，站滿了人，他們剛踏到岸上，只是忙着點頭握手，簡直應接不暇；一般新聞記者又忙着攝影，訪問，要求談話；羣衆的人潮，又把他們國得水洩不通，在當時的周先生夫婦和胡女士眞是進退俱難，被擠得混身大汗。</p>
<p>歡迎會上的周劍雲先生</p>
<p>周胡歸國了，在八日下午二時，明星公司全體同人開會歡迎，周先生起立報吿在國外一切所見所聞的經歷。沉痛時慷慨激昂，幽默時令人作會心的微笑，在連續二點多鐘的演說中，報吿了他們在蘇聯及歐洲考察的經過，同時暢談各國政治現狀，民情風俗，及周氏在游歷中所見所聞的感想，口能懸河，滔滔不絕；而每句每字，都能震撼人心。在這樣長的時間中，非但周先生的精神，沒有絲毫倦意，全體聽衆也都非常感奮，十分動容·周氏不但是精明能幹，富有魄力的電影企業家，同時也是天才的演說家呢·</p>
<p>鄭老夫子口中的胡蝶</p>
<p>在歡迎會上，周劍雲先生報吿的是胡蝶女士，他的國語講得很好，態度也很從容，語意間尤多謙遜之意，末了還說：這次出國，並沒有得到如各位預期那樣的進步，自己很慚愧希望各同志不吝指敎，使自己更加努力，向成功的大道前進。後來娜老夫子當衆介紹，說：「胡小姐實在太謙了，不說別的，就是拿她剛才那種扼要的報吿，和得體的演辭，和出國時的演說比較，單祇這一點，可證明她已經有可驚的進步了·」</p>
<p>十分興奮的鄭正秋</p>
<p>鄭正秋老夫子，身體很瘦弱，大家都知道她是弱不禁風男性林黛玉。十天有七八天睡在牀上。講話是低低的，平常總是沈默的時候多。但是周胡歸國的那天，在歡迎周胡會上，鄭老夫子的容光煥發，說話特別洪亮，說話又很有風趣，引得大家都向他笑，他自己說這天的精神比平時特別興奮，高興。</p>
<p>搶吃麵包</p>
<p>歡迎開會的時間很長久，散會時，下午六點多鐘了，每個人的肚子，似乎都起了恐慌，接着在某一個角裏起了談話的聲音，「什麼？』「吃點心的票子」。「你有嗎？」一時你要我要　刻兒功夫全體在會的同人都拿到了，在這樣的高興的情緒當中，大家到領取點心的地方，每隻手都把一張點心券，換了一包，麵包蛋糕，登時大嚼起來。</p>
<h3 id="c207">「賣笑」 <a href="#c207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>

<h3 id="e14">Intensification of Anglo-Japanese Contradictions <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>— Ang</p>
<p>Japanese Minister of the Army Hayashi returned last month after inspecting the puppet state. He strongly advocated implementing the second stage of operations, complaining about the unbearable hardships faced by Japanese troops in Manchuria. After the resolution of the Hebei-Chahar Incident, Doihara once again suggested to the Kwantung Army to seek economic development in North China. Recently, the voices for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation have grown louder and louder. Based on our observations, we can roughly understand that Japan's economic strategy has two major goals: one is to integrate the puppet state with North China, and the other is to establish the so-called East Asian bloc based on China, Japan, and "Manchukuo." However, in the process of striving for thorough implementation, it will inevitably lead to deeper and more intense conflicts of interest with Britain and the United States. This can be asserted.</p>
<p>According to political economists, after a country is divided, the economic adjustment and political reconstruction of its various parts are extremely difficult problems. Therefore, the severed parts, under the new political organization, need to interconnect their railway systems and other transportation enterprises with the cities, commercial ports, and harbors under the previous political organization. The Japanese occupied the four northeastern provinces with military force, and the economic connection between within and outside the Pass was abruptly cut off. Our country was greatly hit, and Japan also faced great difficulties in managing the four provinces. Therefore, after military action, the Japanese immediately demanded postal and transportation connections and are now eagerly seeking economic cooperation. According to Japanese newspapers, what Japan is focusing on are the coal of Shanxi, the oil of Shaanxi, the iron of Chahar, the salt of Bohai, and the cotton of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Among them, cotton is particularly valued because Osaka's textile industry is developing rapidly and requires a large amount of cotton annually, worth 100 million Japanese yen. Most of it is purchased from the United States and India. Recently, trade with the United States and India has been unfavorable, so there is an urgent need to change direction to remedy the situation. According to recent news, as a result of consultations between Yata, the vice president of the South Manchuria Railway Company, the commander of the South Command, and other leaders of the Kwantung Army, it was decided to start by investigating the economic conditions of North China and set up a management agency in Tianjin. Then, based on the results of the investigation, concrete measures will be determined. This is the manifestation of the first goal of Japan's economic strategy.</p>
<p>Moreover, Japan has an even bigger goal, which is to incorporate China, Japan, and "Manchukuo" into the East Asian bloc. Since the global economic panic of 1929, European and American countries have implemented economic nationalism to protect themselves. The United States has raised tariffs, and Britain has formed the Ottawa Group. Japan's industry has expanded, but the market has shrunk. So, it has implemented its traditional continental policy and occupied the four provinces of our country. According to the recent theory of people within the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Manchurian Incident was a development of the Washington Conference and a reaction to the Nine-Power Treaty. Japan believes that the principles of open door and equal opportunity stipulated in the Nine-Power Treaty are nothing more than an attempt to legitimize the rights of the Anglo-Saxon race. Even the extraterritoriality left over from the Treaty of Nanjing is nothing more than a tool for British imperialism to seize special privileges. When Foreign Minister Hirota took office, Tokyo once publicized the idea of first abandoning extraterritorial rights in China, probably wanting to show Japan's attack on the Treaty of Nanjing. Looking at the above, Japan's intention is obviously to fundamentally overthrow the Treaty of Nanjing and the Nine-Power Treaty, which are based on the interests of Europeans and Americans, and establish the so-called East Asian bloc based on the interests of Japanese imperialism. In other words, it wants to place the overall situation in East Asia on a new foundation and compete with the British Ottawa Group, the American Monroe Doctrine Group, and the Soviet Socialist Group.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, traces of Japan's desire to exclude foreign forces have been found. The unofficial statement of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs opposing cooperation between various countries and us on April 17 last year was a tentative move. The purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway by the puppet Manchukuo on March 23 this year and the implementation of the petroleum monopoly on April 10 are all gradual manifestations of its plan. In addition, in terms of thought, it advocates the restoration of the inherent Eastern culture and promotes Confucianism. In domestic schools, there are even proposals to emphasize Chinese and abolish foreign languages. Even for our countrymen who are proficient in English, although they can directly talk to each other in English in private exchanges, they deliberately ask for interpreters to translate back and forth in Chinese and Japanese. The thoroughness and detail of their intentions can be seen.</p>
<p>The United States and Britain seem to have become aware of the seriousness of the situation in the Far East, and Britain in particular seems to be rising up to seek its own interests. What has already been seen is that important figures such as Baldwin and Eden frequently sent overtures to the United States, and Cadogan's words and actions before and after his promotion to ambassador implied various things. As for the British government's special appointment of its chief economic advisor, Leith-Ross, to come to China in August, it is even more worthy of consideration. No wonder the British government and the public unanimously regard it as the only positive action towards the Far East in recent decades. New Foreign Secretary Hoare recently stated in the House of Commons that "maintaining the principle of the open door and fully recognizing China's autonomy remain the broad foundation of British politics." He also said, "If China wants to restore its historical position in the world, it needs help from the West no less than from the East." This is an even more obvious positive expression of its views on the situation in the Far East.</p>
<p>The situation in which Britain and Japan are competing for interests in the Far East has now unfolded. This is a rare encounter for us in the past century, and it is also a key to the rise and fall of the two major forces of the East and the West in the world. It is not easy to say what the future situation will be. We are the first to bear the brunt. How can we handle it well? Self-reliance is inherently difficult to discuss, but in this new era of extraordinarily complex international relations, diplomatic handling is the most cautious consideration. Fortunately, Mr. Sun Yat-sen, the mentor of our nation, has made clear pronouncements in principle on our country's diplomatic policy in his works and will. I think the gentlemen of the authorities, even in times of extreme difficulty, should also regard them as a guide.</p>

<p>(Changchun) Yata, Vice President of the South Manchuria Railway, went to Changchun on the 11th to conduct important consultations with the Kwantung Army regarding the task of the South Manchuria Railway developing the North China economy. There was a consensus that the South Manchuria Railway must be active in developing the North China economy. However, the South Manchuria Railway has not yet established a fundamental strategy due to funding issues. The planned increase in capital for the South Manchuria Railway is currently difficult to achieve. At this time, the limit for issuing corporate bonds may be expanded to raise funds.

<p>Manzhouli. The chief representative of Outer Mongolia at the Manzhouli Conference has repeatedly been absent due to illness, and there is no hope of resuming the conference in the short term. It was decided to return to Urga midway through the conference and ask the "Manchukuo" side for recognition. On the morning of the 14th, he departed from here with his entourage to return to his country. (Teletype from Dentsu on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Changchun) Regarding the incident of the detention of surveyor Inukai, the authorities of both "Manchukuo" and Japan are waiting peacefully for a peaceful resolution from the perspective of peace in the Far East. On July 4, a request was made to Outer Mongolia, and the content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Outer Mongolian soldiers illegally crossed the border in the Hailar Tungor area and shot at Kwantung Army surveyors within the territory of "Manchukuo," plundering their equipment and detaining them. This incident was obviously due to the lack of control over the Outer Mongolian soldiers. Given the dangerous nature of the Outer Mongolian soldiers, we demand that the responsible personnel be punished. (2) If border disputes are only resolved locally, it is difficult to guarantee that they will not happen again in the future. Therefore, in order to eliminate this source of trouble and ensure the future, both parties should establish permanent institutions, exchange representatives, and exercise effective handling to seek a proper solution. This is the most appropriate good policy. (3) If Outer Mongolia is hesitant to recognize the establishment of this permanent institution, then Tangsegesmei (transliteration) should be designated as the boundary line, and the Outer Mongolian army, which is likely to cause disputes from this location, should be withdrawn to prevent future disputes.</p>
<p>If Outer Mongolia can show sincerity in this matter, then the matter will be easily resolved. However, on the one hand, the power relationship behind the Communist Party is also being taken seriously. We are currently on alert. (Teletype from Nichiren on the 13th)</p>

<h3 id="e18">Two Unexpected Events Suddenly Arise, New Developments in the European Situation, Austrian Premier's Car Accident Affects Political Situation, Rumors of Romania and Russia Negotiating a Security Treaty, Saying the Little Entente's Foreign Policy is Consistent <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Hungarian Capital. Prince Paul, Regent of Yugoslavia, left Sinaya in a special train at 11 o'clock this afternoon. Thus, one of the most important conferences of Balkan countries in recent years came to an end. Within an hour before the end, two unexpected events suddenly occurred, which made the significance of this conference even greater. The first was that Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg suddenly had a car accident. At a time when the question of the restoration of the Habsburg royal family is attracting worldwide diplomatic attention, this matter will make the future even more uncertain. I recall that two years ago, the Little Entente countries met in Belgrade to discuss the question of the Habsburg restoration. The conference decided that if Austria and Hungary took such actions, the Little Entente countries would immediately mobilize. If Schuschnigg's injuries are serious, Austrian affairs will have to be temporarily handled by Deputy Prime Minister Prince Starhemberg or other cabinet members, and the issue of restoration may suddenly change. However, at the Sinaya Conference, Czech Foreign Minister Beneš agreed to act in concert with other countries of the Little Entente. As for the second unexpected event, the French and Russian ministers suddenly came to the Sinaya Palace at 10 o'clock in the afternoon. At that time, they were immediately received by King Carol. It is likely that Prince Paul also met with the two ministers. The Hungarian official news agency said that the two ministers suddenly went there to suggest the conclusion of a Romanian-Russian security treaty, all clauses of which would be based on the Russian-Czech treaty. It is still impossible to prove whether this news is true, but it is a fact that France is trying to dispel Prince Paul's suspicion of Russia. According to the diplomatic circles in the Romanian capital, the Russian minister's visit to Sinaya indicates that the time is ripe for Romania to participate in the French-Czech-Russian military agreement. Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu plans to visit Moscow, which is likely to happen no later than mid-October. It is said that in the past two days, Titulescu has strongly urged Prince Paul to find a way to make Yugoslavia recognize Russia before October at the latest, so that the two countries of Yugoslavia and Romania can sign a non-aggression treaty with Russia at the same time when Titulescu visits Russia. After the end of the Sinaya Conference, the attendees believed that the slightly different opinions among the Little Entente countries in recent months had been eliminated. From now on, the Little Entente countries will be able to continue their common foreign policy, and Yugoslavia will try to make Bulgaria give up its demands for revision. If there are other questions, they can be discussed at the next meeting at the end of August. (Teletype from the National News Agency on the 14th)</p>

<p>(Berlin) Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg's car accident caused a nervous shock, and his wife has died from her injuries. It is reported that the German ambassador to Austria, former Deputy Prime Minister Papen, returned to his country by plane after comforting Schuschnigg. Here, we are closely watching the situation that may arise in Austria. (Teletype from Havas on the 13th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) The general public says that Schuschnigg's car accident will not affect the political situation. The cabinet met today to express condolences to the prime minister. In the evening, a memorial service for the prime minister's wife was held at the Linz City Church, and the prime minister personally attended. Political figures and residents of the capital are very calm because Prime Minister Schuschnigg's health is good. (Teletype from Havas on the 13th)</p>
<p>Details of the Accident</p>
<p>(Vienna) Austrian Prime Minister Dr. Schuschnigg and his wife were traveling by car when they encountered an accident. His wife died instantly, and Schuschnigg seemed to have completely lost his memory due to excessive shock. Currently, he cannot remember anything. If this condition persists, he will no longer be able to manage political affairs. (Teletype from Reuters on the 14th)</p>
<p>Details of the Accident</p>
<p>(Vienna) The detailed circumstances of Prime Minister Schuschnigg's car accident have now been clarified as follows: The Prime Minister and his wife were traveling to Linz, Upper Austria, to attend the sports meeting of Catholic groups and deliver a speech. When traveling near Aston, the car, traveling at a speed of 80 kilometers per hour (slightly less than 50 miles), suddenly collided with a large tree on the side of the road. Mr. and Mrs. Schuschnigg were thrown out of the car, and Mrs. Schuschnigg's spine was completely broken and she died on the spot. She was only 34 years old. The Prime Minister was unconscious for some time before waking up. The driver was seriously injured. After the car crashed, the fuel tank caught fire. Colonel Bader, the Prime Minister's secretary, and a police officer arrived in another car and put out the fire. After the Prime Minister woke up, his nerves were still shocked and had not recovered. He had gone to Ebesburg for rest, and his wife's remains had also been transported there. Liewedela, the chief of the secret police in Upper Austria, claimed that the car accident was accidental. It is generally believed that it was caused by the hot weather, the driver's dizziness, and poor mechanical condition. The Cabinet met in the afternoon. Deputy Prime Minister Prince Starhemberg heard the news in Venice, Italy, and rushed back to Austria. It is estimated that he will arrive in the evening. The Prime Minister's duties will be assumed by Mr. Starr until the Prime Minister recovers. (Teletype from Havas on the 13th)</p>
<p>Suspected Conspiracy</p>
<p>(Vienna) After Prime Minister Schuschnigg was injured in a car accident, although the authorities officially denied any conspiracy in the car, the police have announced a state of alert, and the leader of the Internal Guard has also ordered members to report their whereabouts every hour. According to a correspondent for a British newspaper, Mrs. Schuschnigg recently received a mourning dress sent by an anonymous Austrian National Socialist Party member, with a small note attached stating that Mrs. Schuschnigg would soon need the dress. Today, it was announced here that the Prime Minister was injured and needed a long period of rest, so political affairs would be handled by Deputy Prime Minister Prince Starhemberg. The Prince, who is currently in Venice, has discussed everything with the authorities here by telephone. If there are no major incidents, he has decided to stay in Venice until July 20.

<p>Romanian Sinaya Palace. Prince Paul, Regent of Yugoslavia, has set out for Bretz to meet with General Gondylis, the Greek Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of War.

<p>Czech Capital. The semi-official "Czech News" newspaper recently published a commentary authorized by the government, correcting the divergent opinions of the Little Entente countries regarding the Austrian cancellation of the exile order for the Habsburg royal family as reported by foreign newspapers. It said, "The Little Entente countries and the Habsburg royal family can never reconcile. The restoration of Austria is not only intolerable to the Little Entente, but it is also intolerable to discuss its possible situation. If the Habsburg royal family returns to Austria or the capital of Hungary, disturbances and unrest will occur in Central Europe, and their impact will affect the whole of Europe. The Little Entente countries not only oppose restoration, but also do not allow Archduke Otto and the deposed Empress Zita to return to Austria." The newspaper also believes that although the Austrian cabinet members say that restoration is not an issue at present, this declaration is enough to cause disturbances in Central Europe and delay the resolution of economic problems in Central Europe. Some say that the Austrian restoration is enough to prevent the realization of the German-Austrian union, which is also not true, because restoration is a preliminary method of German-Austrian union and is enough to brew a European war."

<p>(Paris) Today is National Day. The weather is clear and the capital is full of joy and enthusiasm. Tricolor national flags flutter in the wind from the windows of houses all over the city. Vehicles are covered with flags and speeding along the streets. However, there are few pedestrians on the streets, because the masses are gathered in the Place de l'Étoile to watch the troops stand ready for the arrival of the President, government ministers, the diplomatic corps, and various legal entities. Then, President Lebrun, accompanied by Minister of the Army Fabry, Minister of the Navy Pietri, and Minister of Aviation General Thrand, passed under the Arc de Triomphe to pay tribute to the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, and a review was held in front of the army for a long time. Then, a ceremony was held to award medals and flags to the newly established air force. Until 9:35, various troops began to march in formation. (Teletype from Havas on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) In today's National Day parade, the air force maneuvers were the most spectacular. A total of more than 600 aircraft flew from all over the country to gather in the skies of Paris. The aircraft were arranged in triangles, with three, five, or seven aircraft in each team. When the weather was clear, the sound of the aircraft was deafening in the sky. The residents of Paris all looked up and cheered loudly. Then, the aircraft circled the city for a week before flying back to their original positions. (Teletype from Havas on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Today is French National Day. In the morning, in addition to the "Front Ligne," a grand open-air meeting will be held. A total of 15 political parties and groups will participate. At 3:15 pm, the "Popular Front" will gather at the Place de la Bastille for a large-scale parade that will disperse at the Vincennes racetrack in the suburbs. It is expected that 200,000 people will participate. Right-wing groups will demonstrate at the Arc de Triomphe at 5 pm. The Paris City Government fire trucks have all been dispatched and are stationed at various important locations to prevent accidents. (Teletype from Havas on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The "Popular Front," jointly organized by the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Radical Socialist Party, began to gather at the Place de la Bastille at 2 pm, an hour and a half earlier than scheduled. Cars from all over the city arrived like a tide, and the demonstrators stood in the strong sunlight. Red flags fluttered in the wind everywhere, mixed with tricolor national flags. There were no police maintaining order there, because the organizers of the demonstration were responsible for maintaining order themselves. As of 3 pm, no incidents had occurred. Also, when the Popular Front held a meeting at the Buffalo Stadium this morning, the crowd sang the French national anthem, the Marseillaise, and former Congressman Douclos spoke on behalf of the Communist Party, saying that the Marseillaise and the tricolor flag were symbols of past revolutionary struggles. In the past, left-wing demonstrations would always reject the tricolor flag and use the red flag, and reject the Marseillaise and sing the Internationale, but this time it is not entirely the case, which is also worth noting. (Teletype from Havas on the 14th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The Popular Front, a joint organization of the left-wing Radical Socialist Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party, held an anti-Pan-Germanism demonstration at the Buffalo Stadium in the southern suburbs at 9 am this morning, called "the Cornerstone of Peace and Freedom." About several thousand people participated. The Radical Socialist Party branches in the provinces also sent several representatives to the capital. The chairman of the Human Rights League, Bache, delivered the opening speech, followed by speeches by a number of people, such as Perrin, a physics professor at the University of Paris (who won the Nobel Prize in Physics and is currently the Deputy Dean of the National Academy of Sciences), the famous left-wing writer Barbusse, the General Secretary of the General Confederation of Labor Stonehouse, the Socialist Congressman Faure, and the Communist Congressman Douclos. Among them, Professor Perrin spoke in the name of "Popular Assembly," expressing respect "to the Communist Party, the Socialist Party, the Radical Socialist Party, and all sincere people," saying that these people, regardless of faction, have the determination to protect freedom and gather together with the hope of love and justice, which is a great feat.

<p>(Rome) According to well-informed sources, the Italian government does not want the Abyssinian question to be resolved by the League of Nations. Even any solution proposed by Britain and France based on the 1906 Anglo-French-Italian Treaty would not be trusted by Italy. The semi-official Italian newspaper stated, "The Abyssinians are stubborn and do not understand what Italy's rights are. The dispute between the two sides cannot be resolved by the League of Nations." The Evening Post said, "The only way to preserve Italy's prestige is to keep the League of Nations out of the matter." The People's Daily said, "Italy has the right to develop colonial enterprises, and given Abyssinia's various improper actions, Italy has no choice but to resort to war. We cannot accept the signing of any agreements, because such agreements cannot provide any guarantees for the future." (Havas, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) If the League of Nations Executive Council convenes on July 25th to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, Italy seems likely to send representatives to Geneva to attend. The Italian authorities are not as hostile to the League of Nations as before, as they feel that Britain is now very unwilling for the League to take action against Italy. Italy believes it has ample reason to present to the League. If Italian representatives attend the Executive Council meeting, they will likely demand the suspension of Abyssinia's membership in the League of Nations. (Reuters, 14th)</p>

<p>The Truth About the Conflict Between Abyssinian Soldiers and Italian Territory</p>
<p>Abyssinian Capital According to the Abyssinian side, the following is what happened regarding the conflict between Abyssinian soldiers and the Italian consulate near Harar: An Italian consul, accompanied by a secretary, was traveling by car on the road from Diredawa to Harar. The car had no insignia. At the time, there was an Abyssinian cavalry guard stationed there. The car attempted to pass through the cavalry guard line. The horses, seeing the car, were startled and tried to escape. The soldiers then signaled from a distance, ordering the driver to stop. The car initially continued to move, but the commander of the cavalry sent soldiers to the front of the car to explain. The car then stopped. Therefore, the actions of the cavalry officers and soldiers were proper. As for what the consul intended to do there, that is unknown. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Abyssinia Applies to Join the Red Cross</p>
<p>(Geneva) Abyssinia has not yet joined the International Red Cross Convention, so it has no obligation to respect the flags of other countries' Red Cross organizations. However, because of this, it also cannot enjoy the right of the Red Cross to protect its wounded soldiers. Abyssinia, with the Italian-Abyssinian war becoming increasingly imminent, has applied to the Central Committee of the International Red Cross to join. If this move is successful, Abyssinia will be able to obtain all the services of the Red Cross in wartime. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>The US Has No Intention of Invoking the Pact of Paris</p>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull told reporters today that the Kellogg-Briand Pact is "a sacred obligation," and that "there is no other way to resolve any international dispute other than peacefully." It is generally believed that Mr. Hull's remarks are a direct request to Italy to resolve its dispute with Abyssinia peacefully. However, observers here do not believe that Mr. Hull will formally invoke the treaty at the request of the Abyssinian Emperor. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Official circles here have not commented on US Secretary of State Hull's statement that the signatories of the Kellogg-Briand Pact have all agreed to renounce war. The resentment caused by Mr. Hull's conversation with Italian Ambassador to the US Rosa has gradually disappeared since receiving Mr. Rosa's official report. This is because Mr. Rosa stated that the main nature of the conversation was about US-Italian commercial issues, not the Italian-Abyssinian issue. (National Telegram, 14th)</p>

<p>(Washington) The State Department announced today that the United States and the Soviet Union have signed a trade agreement in Moscow for a period of one year. The agreement was signed by US Ambassador to Russia Bullitt and Soviet Foreign Minister Litvinov. This is the first expression of promoting commerce since the United States recognized the Soviet Union on November 16th of the year before last. In the agreement, the Soviet Union guarantees to purchase US goods worth US$30 million within one year, in exchange for the United States allowing the Soviet Union to enjoy reduced tariffs. The only other countries that currently enjoy these benefits are Belgium, Haiti, and Sweden. Since the Russian Revolution in 1917, commercial relations between the United States and Russia have long been unsatisfactory. After the signing of the agreement, US exports to Russia should be greatly developed. The recent negotiations between the two countries had virtually stalled, so the sudden conclusion of the agreement was quite unexpected. (National News Agency, 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The US-Russian trade agreement was signed today. The authorities of both sides hope that trade between the two countries can triple in the future. According to the terms of the agreement, the Soviet Union undertakes to purchase US$30 million worth of goods in the next twelve months. The United States, for its part, agrees to grant the Soviet Union the same facilities as those provided in commercial treaties and other treaties with certain countries. One of the most important of these is that the Soviet Union can pay half the US tariff on manganese. The agreement was concluded through an exchange of official documents in Moscow. The agreement did not mention the debt issue. (Reuters, 13th)</p>

The Turkish ambassador to Romania has arrived here to arrange for the transportation and resettlement after arriving in Turkey. It is reported that the first batch of 1,300 people will be repatriated. After that, there will be two ships leaving here for Turkey every week. The process is that these Turks returning to Turkey will first sell their property and, after obtaining funds to return to their country, can purchase property of the same value in Turkey. Therefore, although these people have undergone some changes, there is not much impact on their property. At the same time, on the Turkish side, the population can suddenly increase by more than one million, which is also a great gain. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Industry recently explained the lease of mining rights and the relationship between roads and mining areas as follows: Mining rights, except for inheritance, transfer, mortgage, delayed payment disposal, and compulsory execution, shall not be the purpose of rights, as clearly stipulated in Article 14, Paragraph 1 of the Mining Law. If a mining right holder requests to lease the mining right, it violates the provisions of this article and should not be approved. If a mining right holder entrusts others to manage the business on their behalf, and the content of the contract has the nature of leasing or pawning, it can be rejected when reporting. If it has been implemented without reporting, the contract is invalid, but how to punish it should be decided by the court. As for the public roads referred to in Article 22, Paragraph 3 of the Mining Law, they naturally include national, provincial, county, township, and district roads. When opening up the above-mentioned public roads, it is appropriate to find a way to bypass the areas that have been designated as mining areas. (Central News Agency, 14th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs has advised all provinces and cities that foreign missionaries traveling to the interior often have their passports confiscated by military police because the validity period of the passport itself is not stipulated, which leads to questions from foreigners. This type of situation is especially common for French priests. It should be known that although the right to sign foreign passports is in our hands, the right to stipulate the effective time of the passport belongs to the issuing country, and it is not convenient for us to interfere. In the future, if local authorities encounter foreign travel passports and missionary passports whose visas have expired, they should immediately advise them to apply for a new visa and inform them that the purpose of the visa is to facilitate investigation and achieve the purpose of sufficient protection, except for the locations where they can pass through and reside. There is no restriction on travel and missionary work. If priests are in remote areas and it is inconvenient to go to the county government to request a visa, they should immediately transfer the expired passport to the county government for a new visa at the nearest public security bureau and return the passport to the individual as quickly as possible. All passports that have not been visaed should be visaed immediately. If a visa has already expired, it should be renewed immediately. The original passport should not be detained, which will cause misunderstandings among foreigners. (Special Dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>A dispatch from Hankou: In recent days, the Xiang River has risen sharply, and the water from Dongting Lake has overflowed, converging at Hankou. The water level has risen to 51 feet 4 inches, and all dikes in Wuhan are in a state of emergency. On the 12th, the Changfeng South Embankment in Hankou collapsed, causing a vast inundation of hundreds of miles, stretching from Duoluokou, passing through Xiaojiadi, Luojiadun, Hanjiadun, Jiangjiadun, Xinjiadi, Zhoujiadun, to the factories of the British American Tobacco Company, and the villages along the Hankou-Yichang Road. This embankment and the Changfeng North Embankment are both protections for the Zhang Gong Dike, which in turn protects the entire city of Hankou. On the 11th, the North Embankment collapsed, and the Zhang Gong Dike was already in danger. The collapse of the South Embankment further aggravated the situation, so the Zhang Gong Dike, known for its solidity, is in danger of collapsing at any time. Mayor Wu Guozhen and Police Chief Chen Xizeng have been inspecting and directing the rescue efforts at the dike for several days, but it is still difficult to reverse the critical situation. On the 13th, a section of the dike in Huangjia Xiaowan collapsed once, and the foot of the dike in the Jinkou section between Qiaokou and Gusaoshu collapsed by more than two zhang. Dan Shui Chi, Fenjin Lu, and Chen Jia Ji experienced severe seepage. The cement dikes along the Yangtze River from the Jianghan Customs Wharf, passing through Special District 3, Special District 2, the French Concession, Special District 1, to the Japanese Concession, all leaked water. If the river rises by another foot or so, it could overflow the dikes and flood the entire city. Pacification Commissioner He Chengjun and Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun believe that the safety of Hankou depends on the Zhang Gong Dike, so they paid special attention to the rescue efforts at the dike. On the 13th, He Chengjun and Zhang Qun both supervised the work at the dike, and garrison troops and police also participated. However, it was difficult to conscript civilian laborers. In order to facilitate the rescue work, Zhang Qun specially authorized Garrison Commander Su Peng to take full responsibility for flood control in Hankou. The Municipal Government, the Public Security Bureau, and the Jianghan Engineering Bureau are all under his command. If necessary, he can forcibly conscript labor and materials. Anyone who disobeys orders, obstructs work, or neglects their duties will be immediately sent to the Garrison Headquarters for strict punishment according to military law. After taking office, Ye took up his post at the dike. When Huangjia Xiaowan was in danger, he supervised the rescue work and only turned the situation around by the evening. On the 13th, all sectors of the Party, government, military, and police were mobilized for the rescue work, so the results were quite good. However, while Hankou was temporarily preserved, Hanyang suffered even greater disasters. The Sanyanqiao Dike on the opposite bank of Duoluokou was breached by the Xiang River. All 72 wards of the county were flooded, and many people and animals drowned. Corpses covered the river, a truly tragic sight. In Wuchang, the Wufeng Dike is probably beyond repair, and the dikes along the river are also in critical condition. Personnel from the Provincial Flood Control Committee have been working hard for days, and their work is gradually becoming lax. Liu Shoupeng, Director of the Department of Construction, Cai Mengjian, Chief of the Public Security Bureau, and Zheng Shisheng, the county magistrate, are supervising the rescue efforts and have already designated a second line of defense. If the dikes unfortunately collapse, they will retreat to the new defense. In the counties upstream and downstream, dikes and embankments continue to collapse. Reports of disasters have reached 36 counties and cities, and communication has been cut off in several places. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek yesterday again telegraphed the authorities in Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang to strictly protect the dikes and instruct each county magistrate in the dike counties to inspect the dikes, examine the dangers, and immediately supervise the people to work in case of danger. All materials for flood control should be strictly prohibited from being hoarded by shops to avoid delaying the work. (13th)</p>

The Dongzhuang (Juancheng) breach has been widened by rainwater erosion, and the two breaches have been washed into one large breach, more than 200 zhang wide. The rivers throughout the province have risen, a serious situation not seen in years. In addition to repeatedly telegraphing the central government to request funds for damming the breach and providing disaster relief and requesting punishment for himself, Han Fuju again telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, Chairman Lin Sen, President Wang Jingwei, Song Ziwen, Chairman of the National Economic Council, and Li Yizhi, Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Committee in Kaifeng, on the 13th to report the expansion of the breach and the flood situation. At the same time, he specially appointed Zhang Honglie, Director of the Department of Construction, to represent him in Beijing to meet with important figures in the central government, explain everything in detail, and discuss the allocation of funds for damming the breach and providing disaster relief. He will also represent him at the National Water Conservancy Conference. Zhang Honglie took the train to Shanghai on the morning of the 14th, carrying the handwritten notes that Han Fuju intended to present to the central government.</p>
<p>Breaches Merge into Large Breaches</p>
<p>According to reports from the magistrates of Juan, He, Fan, and Yun counties and Wang Shaochang, the commissioner of the Shandong Experimental Zone, the official dike at Dongzhuang collapsed. From the evening of the 12th, due to heavy rain and rising water, the breaches have been eroded and merged into one large breach, more than 200 zhang wide. The Yellow River rushes out wildly, accounting for 70% of the main river's flow. The breach exceeding the Jiangsu Dam and irrigating Yuncheng County is currently 30 li away from the county seat of Yuncheng. The county is rushing to repair the city protection dike day and night. The breach irrigating Heze is currently about 3 li away from the city. The city protection dike that the county was rushing to build has been destroyed by the strong current. The county town is even more critical. The current is flowing eastward and merging with Wang Lan Lake in Yun County. There is a possibility that the flood will flow into the Nanyang River. Now Jinxiang, Jiaxiang, Yutai and other counties along the lake are rushing to repair dikes near the Nanyang Lake to prevent inundation. At the same time, Wang Shaochang, the head of the Luxi County Political Construction Experiment, specially telegraphed the counties near Lu in northern Jiangsu to quickly build dikes near the Nanyang Lake to prevent inundation. Sun Zerang, the head of the Heze Experimental County, went to Dongzhuang in person on the 13th to meet with Zhang Lianjia, director of the River Affairs Bureau, to discuss the damming of the breach and other matters, and to raise 3 million catties of straw for use in damming the breach. Wang Shaochang believed that the breaches are getting larger and should be dammed as soon as possible, so he submitted a request to the provincial government to order students from rural agricultural schools to bring a cart of straw each to Dongzhuang to dam the breach. Han Fuju has approved this and is proceeding with it. While various parties were building the breach and preparing to prevent inundation, the people's embankments in the two counties of Shou Zhang and Fan County upstream successively collapsed. On the evening of the 12th, when there was heavy rain, the Huanghua Guan on the south bank of Zhang County suddenly collapsed, and the flood flowed back. On the morning of the 13th, the backflow had passed Wang Lou and the Shu Xilou in Yuncheng County and reached Liukou. Fan County and Juancheng are all a vast expanse of water. According to a report from Fan County, the Bai Zhuang people's embankment on the north bank collapsed on the evening of the 12th, and the floodwaters have reached Sunkou Town. Residents along the river are adding small embankments along the Yellow River dike. All the houses and fields within the embankments are flooded and have become a swamp. The scorpion bay in Poutai County and the Zhao Jia Dam in Bin County have been partially submerged, and the situation is extremely dangerous. Urgent telegrams have been sent from all sections. Now the water level in the middle and lower reaches has slightly decreased. The water level in Luokou in the middle reaches is 30.66 meters. It is rumored that the Heigang breach in Henan Province also occurred on the evening of the 12th, with two breaches. One flows southeast directly to Kaifeng, and the other irrigates Dongming County in Hebei Province and heads towards Luxi. If this news is confirmed, then Cao's counties will inevitably be flooded again. The Provincial River Affairs Bureau believes that the Yellow River situation is so serious that it is truly at a critical juncture. It immediately dispatched flood control personnel on the 13th to various dangerous sections along the river, carrying hemp ropes, burlap sacks, and other materials to prepare for emergency rescue at any time. It is said that they have all arrived at their posts.</p>
<p>Shidian in Lijin Suddenly in Danger</p>
<p>In Lijin, downstream on the Yellow River, the Luang Zikou was used to carry out immigration and reclamation. Zhao Mingyuan, the commander of the First Route Militia, supervised the soldiers and civilians to build a cofferdam, and the Dachang was repaired for dozens of miles. However, the section from Luan Jingzikou and above has not yet been completely repaired. On the 12th, the Yellow River suddenly rose sharply, and the torrent scoured the Shidian in the territory of Lijin County above the Luang Jingzikou. The river water overflowed, and is currently being rescued. However, the details have not been reported to the authorities. The people in the plantation area are all very scared. Zhao Mingyuan came to Jinan a few days ago to report on the immigration situation. Now he heard the news and immediately rushed back to Lijin.</p>
<p>Heavy Rain in the Midst of the Flood</p>
<p>The flood is already extremely serious, but on the afternoon of the 12th, there was a torrential downpour all over the province, from the northeast to the southeast. Not only did the Yellow River rise, and the flood victims were in danger, but also the rivers throughout the province were rising, and the reports of collapsed dikes and embankments were flying like snowflakes. The provincial government has telegraphed the county chiefs along the river to step up their efforts to protect them, so as to avoid accidents. Many of the province's power lines and long-distance communication lines have been damaged and are being repaired. From the 12th to the morning of the 13th, Jinan received 46.8 mm of rainfall. It rained again in the afternoon, although it stopped soon afterwards. Up to the evening, it was still not sunny. The heavy rain on the 12th was the heaviest in eastern Shandong, so it washed away a section of the roadbed east of the Zhangdian station on the Jiaoji Railway. The roadbed east of Zhangdian was very high, and it took a lot of effort for freight cars to go uphill. Therefore, when the Zhangdian marshalling yard was built a few days ago, the roadbed was lowered. Unexpectedly, the heavy rain on the night of the 12th turned into a river, which washed away a section of the newly built roadbed, causing the tracks to hang in the air and preventing vehicles from passing. On the same night, one westbound train stopped in Qingzhou, and two eastbound trains stopped in Zhangdian, and traffic was interrupted. On the morning of the 13th, the Jiaoji Railway Bureau sent an engineer with workers and materials to repair it, and the work was completed at about 11:00 a.m. The trains ran as usual. The first train arrived in Jinan at a little after 1:00 p.m., a delay of six hours. (13th)</p>
<h3 id="e80">Chairman Chiang's Speech on the Responsibility of Youth (Continued) - Attending the Expanded Memorial Week in Chengdu - <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Therefore, everyone should cultivate this habit of labor and develop this spirit of service. In the future, everyone should do at least one thing a day that benefits others to create happiness for society. Extending this further, we can do the great cause of governing the country and bringing peace to the world.</p>
<p>Fourth, we must recognize our position and responsibility in the family. You must understand that the position and responsibility of children in the family and your position and responsibility in the country, although different in scope, are the same in principle. You must be a loyal citizen in the country and a virtuous and filial son in the family. Be filial to your parents, respect your elder brothers, and love your younger siblings. You must also develop the virtues of filial piety, friendship, harmony, and care to foster good relations with neighbors and extend them to clan members, villages, relatives, and friends. Love each other, encourage each other in morality, share weal and woe, help each other, and support each other in illness. As for parents and elder brothers in the family, they should also be responsible for teaching their children well, making them know the principles of being a good person. They should also supervise them to learn to work hard, and not let them be lazy and become parasites who harm the family and the country. I can tell you that when I was young, my family was considered well-off, but I still had to wash clothes, sweep the floor, cook, and do other kinds of household chores every day. My mother also supervised me to do this every day, because this is the most basic and important principle of being a good person. We must cultivate this spirit and habit of labor and service in the family from childhood. When we grow up, we can be a healthy citizen. Now there are many elementary school students who not only cannot serve and be filial to their elders in the family, but often have their parents serve them everything, such as serving meals and washing clothes. This is not the principle of being a child. If they are unwilling to do things for themselves and their families, how can they serve society and the country in the future? In general, people who are parents do not teach their children to work hard, which makes their children's bodies become weaker and their spirits become more depressed. This kind of complacency is harmful, and it is not the principle of being a parent. Therefore, you, the general young students, must first respect your parents and elders, respect your elder brothers and love your younger brothers, and harmonize with your neighbors in the family. Secondly, you should labor. All kinds of things, such as fetching water, sweeping, washing, cooking, and gardening, must be done by ourselves to serve the whole family. From this, we can cultivate noble personality, forge a strong physique, and lay the foundation for a healthy citizen.</p>
<p>Fifth, we must recognize our position and responsibility in schools and groups. Schools are also a kind of group. Now the military training groups you are in are also schools. In school, you should of course expect to be excellent students. Excellent young students are the most healthy fighters who protect the country and defend the people. Therefore, all schools, whether teachers or students, must strive to be a healthy fighter. To be a healthy fighter, we must pay special attention to the cultivation of personality, the deepening of knowledge, and the training of the body. But in addition to this, we must also have a spirit of love for the group and the habits of group life. First, we must be able to be affectionate and sincere, and unite as one. At ordinary times, we must love our classmates, and not argue with each other or only seek convenience for ourselves and harm the interests of the group and others. We must always take care of everyone's interests. If friends have difficulties, we must help them. If friends are sick, we must help them. We should love each other like hands and feet, and share each other's hardships and joys. We must unite with sincerity and cooperate. Only in this way can we share difficulties and live and die together, give full play to common and consistent strength, and achieve the common and consistent goal of saving the country. Everyone should cultivate this spirit while they are in school. This spirit is the real power of saving our country. Second, we must obey our leaders. A group must have a leader. The principal of the school, the directors of the departments, the teachers in charge of each class, the leaders of the Boy Scouts or military training groups, the platoon leaders, and the squad leaders are your leaders in the group. You are their subordinates. Subordinates must obey their leaders. The leaders are the people who lead the group. All legal orders of the leaders are the supreme will of the group and the norm for the actions of the members. If a group does not have a leader, it is like a ship without a rudder and cannot become a group. Therefore, you must take obedience to your leaders as your duty and abide by their orders in order to exert the power of the group. Third, we must strictly abide by the rules. Rules are a necessary condition for maintaining group life and an essential element for saving and building the country. If a group does not have rules, it will not have system and cannot be maintained. With rules, there will be common and consistent actions and a common and consistent spirit and power will be generated. The school rules of your school, the rules or military discipline of the Boy Scouts or military training groups, and the laws and regulations of governments at all levels are all rules. The most important cultivation of modern citizens is to pay attention to order and abide by discipline. Whether in class or out of class, or marching and walking, or even in all life and actions, we must abide by certain order and discipline. We now want to save the country and restore the national freedom and equality, which is that everyone abides by discipline and everyone works hard on a common and consistent track. Therefore, all principals and teachers must pay special attention to the spirit of group order and discipline and not allow anyone to disrupt order or break discipline. If the principal and teachers do not fulfill this responsibility, they will harm the students, the school, and the country. The last point is to cultivate the spirit of courage, decisiveness, and adventure through the practice and encouragement of group life. The head should enable each member and the entire group to be full of vigor at all times. Everyone should strive to be enterprising, see righteousness and act courageously, and be able to make wise decisions when things happen. Once a decision is made, no difficulty or danger is enough to move us. As long as it is beneficial to the group, to society, and to the country and the nation, we will not hesitate to sacrifice and take risks to achieve our goals. This spirit and habit of sacrificing oneself for the group and fighting bravely is the true spirit of the revival of the nation (to be continued).</p>

<p>Night Train Engine Caught Carrying Smuggled Soil</p>
<p>According to a tip-off received by the Su-Dan First Section of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway Police, a large quantity of smuggled soil was being transported to Changzhou on the night of the 12th. Section Chief Jiang dispatched Inspector Yao with nine policemen, disguised as laborers, to lie in the grass east of the station in Waiyangqi at around 1:00 AM on the 13th. At around 3:00 AM, the No. 6 night express train from Shanghai to Beijing passed by. They saw a green light shining from the engine near the railway. As they approached the light, burlap sacks were thrown down, and several people came forward to pick them up. The police rushed out of the grass, apprehended the people and the sacks, and brought them to the station to be weighed by the stationmaster, along with witnesses. There were seven sacks of smuggled soil, weighing 22 kilograms, equivalent to about 500 taels in the market. The stationmaster stamped them with the fire stamp. Inspector Yao and others took the witnesses back to the police station for preliminary interrogation. The bag recipients were identified as Gao Liuchun, the main offender, and Zhang San, both residents near the station.

<p>Investigation Reveals Dispute Involving Nine Raw Opium Dealers</p>
<p>At approximately 10:00 AM on the 13th, a passenger named Zhou Zhonghua (27 years old, from Jiangwan, Shanghai), carrying a leather suitcase, walked out of the main entrance of the station as the Shanghai-bound morning express train arrived in He. He immediately hired a rickshaw. Chen Bingkui, a marine police detective, noticed him and suspected his movements. He stepped forward and ordered him to stop, which led to a dispute. The railway police officer and patrol leader stepped forward to detain Zhou Zhonghua and took him back to the station. The stationmaster was notified to open the suitcase, which revealed six large packages of raw opium (totaling 24 jin in market weight). The marine police detective requested to take the opium dealer away, but the railway police argued that the area where the arrest was made was within the jurisdiction of the Jiaxing station, and the case should be handed over to their superiors. Subsequently, personnel from the 5th Marine Police Detachment arrived at the station to escort him, but the patrol leader refused, almost leading to a misunderstanding. Land police also arrived to request, but to no effect. It was not until approximately 5:00 PM that Liao Mianqing, the chief of the Jia閘 sub-section, arrived in He by car. After consulting with the marine police personnel, the marine police detachment prepared an official letter to take the opium dealer and the opium away. However, according to Zhou Zhonghua, he is a tailor and was invited by a friend named Zhao to visit He. The suitcase belonged to Zhao and was entrusted to him to carry, but he did not know it contained opium. He claimed that Zhao had left on the train when the marine police detective questioned him.</p>

<p>The Baoshan County seawall is a barrier for the counties of Shanghai, Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan, and a crucial point on the river and sea. At a time when the Yangtze River flood is severe, the safety of the seawall construction there is of great concern to society. A reporter from Dabai News Agency went to Baoshan County to inquire about the details and recorded them as follows:</p>
<p>Seawall Construction Solidly Repaired Last Year</p>
<p>In the summer and autumn floods of the year before last, the Baoshan seawall was in danger in many places due to frequent wind and rain. Although it was repaired at that time, due to insufficient funds, the project was inevitably not solid. Last year, the Jiangsu Provincial authorities, recognizing the importance of the Baoshan seawall, allocated funds from the Taicang, Jiading, and Baoshan Relief Institute to greatly repair it. The entire seawall project was thus doubled in solidity. Usually, the county government strictly supervises the Seawall Engineering Office to pay attention at all times.</p>
<p>This Year's Plum Rains Caused Minor Damage</p>
<p>During this year's plum rains last month, when the water rose, the waves at the Sanjia Water area outside Wusongkou were particularly large. The seawall was greatly impacted by the torrents. Fortunately, the seawall was built solidly and did not suffer much impact. Only the lower-lying sections of the seawall suffered minor damage. After the Seawall Engineering Office repaired it, there was no major concern.</p>
<p>County Magistrate Inspects Entire Seawall Construction Project</p>
<p>Baoshan County Magistrate Long Tiyao, concerned that the Baoshan seawall might be endangered by the rising waters of the Yangtze River due to the severe Yangtze River flood, went to Shidong, Xuejiatan, Longwang Temple, Wuhedun, and other sections on the day before yesterday with Secretary Wang Rongsan, Third Section Chief Qi Yunzhong, and seawall guards to conduct a detailed inspection. He strictly ordered the seawall guards to supervise and urge the Seawall Engineering Office to pay attention to repairs at all times to avoid danger.</p>

<p>Xu Shiying, Chairman of the National Government Relief Committee, is extremely concerned about the flood disaster. He went to Nanjing a few days ago to discuss disaster relief funds with government officials. It is reported that the disaster relief fund of two million yuan for this year will be allocated by the Ministry of Finance from the national treasury at more than 160,000 yuan per month, to be fully disbursed in twelve months for reserve use. This time, the funds will be diverted for immediate use due to the urgent need for disaster relief. The establishment of the custodial committee is expected to be completed within this month. There will be a total of seven committee members. The Ministries of Finance and Interior, and the Relief Committee will each send one member as ex-officio members. The remaining four members will be appointed by the government from fair and important officials. After the committee is established, two standing committee members will be appointed, with one chairman serving as the standing committee member, to be in charge of affairs. The committee's affairs will be handled concurrently by the Relief Committee, without incurring additional expenses, in order to save public funds. Mr. Xu is going to inspect the disaster areas in various provinces along the Yangtze River. He boarded the Jiang'an ship last night and set sail upstream this morning. He will rush back to Nanjing at the end of the month to attend the custodial committee meeting. It is said that at the beginning of the next month, he will need to go to Huangshan to inspect via an intermediate route.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Decheng, the Sacrificial Official to Confucius, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday. After visiting his family elder, Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, and his wife, he visited the local authorities in the city. He was extremely busy with social engagements. Yesterday noon, he attended a banquet hosted by President Yu of the Control Yuan. In the afternoon, he visited the Datong Music Society. He took the night express train to Nanjing last night to return to Shandong. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Kong's Activities</p>
<p>Mr. Kong, accompanied by his family member Kong Yinqiu, went to Ximen Road at around 11:00 AM yesterday morning to attend a welcome tea party hosted by the Shandong Association in Shanghai. At noon, he went to the New Asia Restaurant on Sichuan Road to attend a luncheon hosted by Yu Youren, President of the Control Yuan. Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and others were invited to attend as well. After the luncheon, Mr. Kong went to the Datong Music Society in the World Society on Ferguson Road to view ancient music. The Confucius Temple in Qufu is currently preparing to establish a very complete ancient music society, so he made a special trip to visit and seek advice. Mr. Kong then went to the city center and the South City to visit various cultural institutions and inspect various construction projects. He returned to his residence on Avenue Petain in the evening to rest. Since the Nanjing Central Military Academy has scheduled a banquet for tonight, Mr. Kong has already returned to Nanjing last night by night express train with Kong Yinqiu and others. He will briefly stay in Nanjing and then return to Shandong.</p>
<p>Family Visits</p>
<p>Kong Zhaoyuan, a representative of the Kong family of Cishui, Zhejiang, residing in Shanghai, visited Mr. Kong Decheng at around 9:00 AM yesterday morning to express his welcome on behalf of all the family members residing in Shanghai and to propose a banquet. However, Mr. Kong politely declined because he was anxious to return to Nanjing. Also, Kong Fanxi and Kong Xiangshu, descendants of the Kong family of Qingpu, the Southern Sect, upon hearing the news, prepared to join forces with the Shanghai Confucian Youth Association and organize schools and groups to hold a grand welcoming meeting out of respect for their ancestors. Yesterday afternoon, Kong Fanxi and Kong Xiangshu, carrying the Kong Family History, photos of the clothing and tomb of Kong, and the plaque of the Great Accomplishment Hall inscribed by Emperor Kangxi, visited the Shanghai office of the Ministry of Finance twice. Kong Decheng and Kong Fanzheng did not return until after 6:00 PM, after a long day of travel. Kong Fanzheng received them and inquired in detail about the current situation of the Kong residence, noting that its history was indeed older than that of Quzhou, Zhejiang. Since he had to leave Shanghai for Nanjing tonight, he could not stay. Regarding the banquet, he would make an appointment by letter when he comes to Shanghai again in the autumn. Kong Fanxi and Kong Xiangshu, seeing that they could not persuade him to stay, entrusted the photos to Kong Fanzheng, expressed their apologies, and took their leave.</p>

<p>Chu Minyi, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 12th and has been visiting Director Wang at Noel Hospital for several days to inquire about his illness.

In addition, He Bingsong, President of Jinan University, also visited the hospital at 8:00 AM yesterday morning to express his condolences. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Chu at his private residence yesterday afternoon and asked about Director Wang's illness. According to Mr. Chu, Director Wang experienced premature ventricular contractions again on July 11 (Thursday), with his pulse stopping five or six times per minute. After taking medication, it still stopped about two or three times per minute the next day (Friday). This is a sign of extreme physical weakness. In addition, due to the hot weather in recent days, he has inflammation of the gallbladder, which has not subsided and requires four or five weeks of recuperation to recover. Mr. Chu also said that Director Wang will move to another location for recuperation.</p>

The telegram was sent yesterday morning, which proves that the two warships were still in Zhenhai yesterday and had not yet set sail north. According to Mr. Chen's friends, the two warships are currently in good condition, and the rumor that the machinery is damaged is not true. Now that the two warships have arrived in Zhenhai, they have effectively returned north, so there is no need to rush to Nanjing.</p>

<h3 id="e102">The Crew of the Maoli No. 2 Arrive in Shanghai, Report Six Drowned After Ship Sank, Including Two Passengers, Three Vendors, One Unidentified <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>After the new Maoli No. 2 steamship of the Maoli Shipping Bureau sank near the Dinghai wharf during its maiden voyage, the crew, including A Yin, arrived in Shanghai yesterday morning. According to reports, a total of six people drowned. Salvage operations for the ship and cargo are underway, and post-disaster arrangements are being made. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Crew Arrive in Shanghai</p>
<p>Twenty-two crew members of the Maoli No. 2 steamship, including Jiang A Yin and stewards, arrived in Shanghai at 7 a.m. yesterday morning aboard the Danshan steamship of the Lian'an Shipping Bureau. They immediately reported the sinking to Hong Baoshun, the owner of the bureau. The ship was carrying approximately 450 passengers when it sailed from Shanghai to Taiwan on the evening of the 11th, including over 200 pilgrims heading to Putuo, about 100 heading to Dinghai, and the remaining 100 or so heading to Shipu, Haimen, Huangyan, and other places. It anchored in the Da Ji ocean area due to fog. Upon arriving at Putuo, all the pilgrims disembarked. At 4 p.m. on the 12th, it arrived in Dinghai and docked at the wharf.</p>
<p>Account of the Sinking</p>
<p>The ship was scheduled to stay at the Dinghai wharf for three hours, allowing people from all walks of life to visit and observe, as well as to load and unload cargo. By around 6 p.m., seven or eight out of ten passengers had disembarked to sightsee and had not returned. About three or four hundred people boarded the ship to look around. At the same time, firecrackers were lit on the wharf, and visitors on the ship flocked to the deck on the wharf side to watch the welcoming scene. This caused the ship to list, and water entered through the stern doors. Passengers and visitors on board scrambled to escape to the shore. The captain and first mate were unable to stop them, leading to the ship sinking in about fifty minutes.</p>
<p>Recovered Bodies</p>
<p>The Dinghai branch immediately dispatched eight divers to investigate and recovered six bodies from the main cabin: three boys around fourteen or fifteen years old, an elderly woman, an elderly man, and a middle-aged man. The elderly woman and man were passengers in the main cabin and were the parents-in-law of A Liu from Taizhou. The three boys were likely vendors who boarded the ship temporarily. Whether the middle-aged man was a passenger or a visitor could not be confirmed at the time. When the ship sank, forty or fifty small boats gathered to provide rescue.</p>
<p>Handling the Aftermath</p>
<p>The Dinghai branch manager, Zhu, along with the ship owner, Xu Yousheng, and compradore, Shi Cantang, made arrangements for the aftermath. They provided travel expenses of one silver dollar each to all 145 stewards on the ship, ordering them to return to their hometowns first. Except for 20 stewards who took the Zhoushan steamship back to Shanghai, the rest took the Dahua steamship back to Haimen. The six recovered bodies have been placed in the local guild hall, awaiting identification by their families. The bureau has decided to provide compensation to the victims.</p>
<p>Salvaging the Ship and Cargo</p>
<p>The Shanghai head office commissioned the China Salvage Company to send 32 people, including engineers, laborers, and divers, accompanied by Zhou Bolun of the bureau, to rush to the scene aboard the Lian'an Gongji Daxing steamship to begin salvage work. They arrived at 7 a.m. yesterday morning and began salvage operations, deciding to first retrieve the cargo and then salvage the steamship. It is said that when the tide is low, four or five feet of the deck is visible above the water, and when the tide is high, two feet are visible. The smokestack and mast are all above the water, and since the location is next to the wharf, salvage should be easy.</p>
<p>Insurance Company Inspection</p>
<p>The China Ship Insurance Association insured the ship for 90,000 national currency in accident insurance. After the sinking, they immediately sent Li Guojie on the Daxing steamship the night before last to inspect the scene. It was found that the ship hull was purchased from the American company Fulai Foreign Firm. After arriving in Shanghai from Ceylon, it was built by the Sino-French Qiuxin Shipyard. All equipment was very complete, making it the best on the Shanghai-Taiwan route. The bottom steel plates are eight-tenths of an inch thick, and the side steel plates are five-tenths of an inch thick. It has only been in operation for twenty-seven years and is very sturdy. It took three months to complete the work, totaling about 150,000 to 160,000 national currency.</p>
<p>Shipping Bureau Announcement</p>
<p>The Maoli head office announced yesterday: "Respectfully informing everyone, our Maoli No. 2 steamship departed from Shanghai on the 11th of this month at 6 p.m. for Putuo, Dinghai, Shipu, Haimen, Huangyan, and other places. It docked at Putuo first and arrived safely in Dinghai at 4 p.m. on the 12th. Around 7 p.m., it was about to depart for Shipu. As the new ship was arriving at the port for the first time, local people held a welcoming ceremony, setting off firecrackers. Passengers came out of the cabins to participate, all leaning to one side, causing the ship to tilt, and water rushed in through the stern doors. It could not be rescued and sank. It is now reported that about six feet is visible above the water at high tide. Fortunately, all passengers and crew are safe. The cargo has been entrusted to the China Salvage Company for salvage, and personnel have been sent to comfort the passengers. A separate report has been submitted to the relevant authorities for protection. Fearing that the outside world does not know the truth, this announcement is made in the newspaper."</p>
<p>Hong's Remarks</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency interviewed Hong Baoshun, the owner of the bureau, at his private residence yesterday morning. According to him, the Maoli No. 2 steamship unfortunately sank next to the Dinghai wharf. Measures have been taken to salvage it and handle the aftermath. It has now been confirmed that the drowned were six vendors. Rumors of it hitting a reef at Laoshu Mountain, damaging the side of the ship, and more than one hundred people drowning are all untrue. Because the accident occurred next to the wharf, and it took fifty minutes to sink, and the mooring ropes were not untied, it was easy to escape. Many small boats nearby provided rescue after the accident, so there is no reason for more than one hundred people to have drowned. He also denied that the Dinghai branch was vandalized by passengers. He also stated that in the news reported by various newspapers about the sinking of his company's Maoli new steamship in Dinghai, the phrase "send divers to Dinghai to salvage ship and cargo" in the telegram reported by compradore Shi Cantang was mistakenly written as "salvage crew." Although it is only one word different, the discrepancy is very large. Please correct it on our behalf.</p>
<p>Rescued Passengers</p>
<p>The Datong News Agency reports that the passengers of the ship have been taken in by local public and private institutions at the Bamin Guild Hall, provided with food, and temporarily maintained. The number of people is 341 in total. The list of their names is extracted below: Zhang Lao Er, (Sanbei Ji) Yu Qingshan, Zhao Fushan, (Shi Xiao Ji) Cao Yunfei, Lin A Huai, Zhang A Er, Huang A Er, Zhou Jindao, Quan Zhenming, Lin Helai, Shi Xiangtian (Luqiao Ji) Sui You, Zhao Lanmou, Wang Liemei, Chen Lishun, Zhu Qingru, Chen Fangjun, Zhu Jingjie, Chen Liqing, Sheng Ranyu, Cen Fangdong, Sun Bangkui, Wang Falian, Wang Yutang, Li Huaju, Zhang Kexing, Wang Xiuwen, Ying Lao Er, Xu Genmei, Lu Changyu, Lin Xiaobao, Li Kexing, You Shunxing, Liu Laisheng, Shao Renfa, Shen Jinsi, Shen Nv, Shen Baoshan, Chen Kexiang, Lin Mingying, Chen Lianyuan, Zhang Wanli, Chen Lao San, Chen Yili (Huangyan Lai), Tao Siyun, Zhang Ziqing, Lu A Jiao, Huang Weiqing, Ying Ziqing, Chen Lianliang, Zhao A San, Wang Jinjiu, Chen Mingbiao, Wang Meiyi, Wang Tiejiang, Chen Shanxin, Zhang Lihe, Chen Youcai, Ni Dezhao, Chen Dongsou, Miao Meiqiu, Li Shunxing, Pan Xiaonai, Zhang Yousheng, Jiang Xiaofu, You Ji You Ji Zi, Xu Miao Shi, Zhang A Fa, Pan Daofa, Meng Xifa, Miao Shunxing, Chen A Yu, Jin Cai Shi, Chen Dazhao, Xiao Niu, Gong Heshang, Shunchang, Zhang Rongsheng, Youfa, Ren Heshang, Yang Yurao, Chen A Jin, Li Shi, Huang Jujin, Ruan Guanquan, Yu Xiachun, Hu Xilu, Chen Huanggan, Wang Xiao Heshang, Chen Huiming, Wang Huiming, Bao Xitiao, Zhang Yourong, Ying A Mei, Jin A Yu, Wang Chengyou, Chen Daquan, Wu Shangsheng, Cui Xiang, Ye Wang Shi, Wang Zhaoyou, Wang Rufa, Wu Litian (Taizhou Ji), Liang Mingfa, Lin Sanmei, Xu Yin You, Jin San Ji, Ye Yizhen, Zhu Qingqiang, A Ying, Jiang Liande, Xi Jitai, Ruan A Qi, Meiyu, Kong Xianyu, Li Meiquan, Li Lou, Li A Gao, Lu Zhongmei, Xiang Daomei, Xiang Lu Shi, Xiao Mei, Zhang Linfu, Dai Fanggai, Xu A Liu, Zhang Shi, Qian Shi, Tao Renjin, Zhang Dexin, Wang Shi, Ye Wumei, Lin Youshun, Tao A Bao, Tang Youfu, Chen Hengbin, Zhang Zhihua, Chen Yunfu, Wu Ronglai, Zhang Ruguo, Yu Shuiguan, Lin Shaolin, Wang Lao Wu, Lu Rurui, Zhang Xiaofa, Jin Meiyu, Shen Rulai, Chen Wang Shi, San Ming, Chen Shi, Shen Guangqing, Chen Qiaofu, Yang Teyou, Jin Huisheng, Jin Faxin, Chen Yungan, Chen Jindao, Chen Meilin, Jin Wuzhang, Lou Mingxiang, Zhang Dazheng, Wang Meiwu, Zhang Yili, Chen Yueyang, Dai A Bao, Chen Junhai, Liu Ming, Bao Simei, Wang Youzhang, Tong Xuerui, Lin Dahui, Ma Yifu, Shen Shiyuan, Zhou Jianchong, Ren Linbao, Li Zonghuan, Chen Lingqing, Xia Xinyou, Weng Dingzhao, Li Xiaonai (Haimen Ji), Chen Baimu, Wang Qingji, Wu A Mei, Fang Mingli, Xu Zhengde, Zhang Faxing, Chen Meitang, Ying Guodao, Wei Tianfu, Hu Guifa, Tang Daoyan, Zhang Shi, Wang Hefu, Xu A Er, Chen Kelai, Chen Jiufu, Xi Zaitian, Ding Xiaolan, Cai Shi Ming, Zhang Wang Shi, Ge Xingtian, Yi Ming, Hu Zihua, Chen Tianfa, Zhang Shaoying, Zhang Bangzhen, Ye Meimei, Su Zaozhao, Lu Qiyun, Chen Lao Wu, Zhixing, Wang A Er, Li Pingmi, Zhang A San, Xu Mingzu, Zu Fa, Wang Dexing, Zhu A Wu, Zhang Zhiqin, Liu Tianhua, Xia Boyao, Hong Zhenyin, Tianfa, Qiu Zhangfa, Sheng Guolin, Sheng Guoqie, Fa Guo, Huang Jingdao, Faxing, Zhang Tianxing, Wang Puju, Chen Meirong, Meihe, Cai Jinxiu, Cai Xiaoyun, Ye Zhifan, A Liang, Wang Yaoci, Wang, Zheng Yongfeng, Ye Faxing, Tao A Yu, Ge Jibai, Bangfu, Lin Shui (Taiping), Dong Da (Beian), Xiang Youcai (Tiantai), Yinzhong (Taiping), Zhang Rutong (Xinqiao), Ye Shi (Taiping), Chen Wumei, Ge Gengeng (Shanghai Ji), Zhu Ranchun, Zhu Shi, Zhu Yulian (Jing Qing), Zhang Guoqiu (Yuhuan), Lin Lijiang, Lin Li Shi (Hai), Chen Jiongjiang (Linhai), Li Ziming (Dacheng), Rufa, Xu Rushan (Dajing), Li Yuru, Chou Yongheng, Wang Zhongnai, and others, 341 people in total.</p>

<h3 id="e106">The Ministry of Finance Opens the Sichuan-Gansu Unified Tax, Goods to be Taxed in Shanghai First <a href="#e106" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c106" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">106</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance only sets up inspection or management agencies in Sichuan and Gansu, according to Dagong News Agency. In order to rectify tax revenue, the Ministry of Finance instructed the Tax Department to consult with Guan Yuji, the financial commissioner stationed in Sichuan, and the Sichuan Provincial Finance Department to investigate the detailed import and export figures for cotton yarn, cement, matches, etc., and the actual tax revenue compared to the past, in order to implement a unified tax. Now that the 30 million yuan to reorganize Sichuan's financial bonds has been passed by the Legislative Yuan and will be issued on August 1, its funds are guaranteed by the Sichuan unified tax and stamp and tobacco tax revenue. Therefore, the opening of the Sichuan provincial unified tax cannot be delayed. It is now learned that the Ministry of Finance has prepared the measures for opening the Sichuan provincial unified tax, and has also agreed with the Chairman of Gansu Province, Zhu Shaoliang, to open the Gansu Province cigarette unified tax. Both will be officially announced by the Ministry of Finance. According to sources in the Tax Department yesterday, the method for levying the unified tax in Sichuan and Gansu provinces is to first levy taxes on cigarettes sold to Sichuan and Gansu in Shanghai in accordance with the law, and only set up an inspection or management agency in Sichuan and Gansu to prevent smuggling and leakage.</p>
<h3 id="e107">After the Ministry of Finance Postponed the Transaction Tax, Agents from Five Exchanges Sent a Letter of Thanks to Minister Kong, Held the Fifth Current Affairs Meeting Yesterday, Expressing Gratitude for Minister Kong's Consideration of the Difficulties of Business <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The United Association of Brokers' Associations of the five exchanges in this city decided to send a letter of thanks after Minister Kong showed consideration for the difficulties of business and approved the postponement of the transaction tax. A reporter from the Industry News Agency investigated and recorded the details as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Meeting</p>
<p>The association held its fifth standing committee meeting at Six Horses Road Yizhixiang Western Restaurant at 6 p.m. yesterday. Those present included Bian Futang, Wu Xunqing, Kuang Jian, and Zhang Bojin from the Cotton Yarn Association; Zhan Liansheng, Zhang Zhusun, Gao Qiumei, and Wang Jiafu from the Gold Association; Zhang Weiyun, Zhu Jiansheng, and Xia Rongchang from the Flour Association; He Peiyuan and Qiu Lianggui from the Securities Association; and Xue Chengzhang and Xu Jianqi from the Grain Association, totaling more than ten people. Bian Futang chaired the meeting, and Shao Xingru recorded the minutes. After the usual formalities, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting, stating that the five exchanges paid transaction tax to the Ministry of Finance, originally scheduled to be levied on July 1. Later, due to the economic downturn and business difficulties, merchants repeatedly requested postponement. Minister Kong showed consideration for the difficulties of business and approved the postponement, for which the merchants are extremely grateful and should immediately send a letter of thanks. Discussion then began. (1) A motion to send a letter of thanks to Minister Kong for approving the postponement of the transaction tax was passed. (The letter of thanks is detailed below.) (2) A motion proposed by the members of the Gold Association to ban illegal institutions outside the industry from accepting entrusted transactions of gold, cotton yarn, and other goods futures was resolved to request the competent authorities to strictly prohibit them in order to maintain business. (3) Other routine cases were omitted. After the meeting, dinner was served and the meeting adjourned around 9 p.m.</p>
<p>Letter of Thanks to Minister Kong</p>
<p>Humble respects to Minister Kong, the Association and others respectfully submit that, as the government promulgated the transaction tax regulations, it came at a time when the national economy was contracting and industry and commerce were on the verge of danger. Merchants were willing to serve the country but lacked the ability to help the times. Therefore, they dared to repeatedly request your Ministry to consider the difficulties of the times and grant a postponement. The matter was presumptuous, but the situation was unavoidable. Your insight into the difficulties of business and your approval of the request, as indicated in the approved instructions, have been praised throughout the country.

<h3 id="e109">The Dispute at the Guangxin Dye Factory, Mediated and Resolved by the City Federation of Trade Unions, Jin Tingsun Donates Funds for Workers' Expenses <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that the Guangxin Shengji Dye Factory on Minsheng Road in Zhabei was founded by Ningbo merchants Chen Yuanfu and others and employs more than 100 workers. Recently, due to the economic downturn and intense competition in the industry, the factory was forced to cancel the one-yuan monthly wage for dyeing apprentices, which aroused dissatisfaction among all 40 dyeing workers, who demanded that the factory revoke the order. The factory did not approve. The workers unanimously resigned on their own initiative. The factory paid wages and commissions, but the workers also requested the payment of annual bonuses. The factory stated that the workers were subcontractors and had no bonuses according to the regulations, so it did not approve the request, resulting in a dispute that could not be resolved. The workers petitioned the City Federation of Trade Unions for assistance. Standing Committee Member Shao Lubai, together with factory director Zhu Meixian, conducted mediation. As a result, the workers gave up their demand for bonuses. However, Shao, considering the workers' difficulties, asked Jin Tingsun to donate travel expenses of 14 silver dollars per person, totaling 672 silver dollars, all of which were handed over to the Dyeing Industry Union's Yangse Office for distribution to the workers. The case has been declared successfully resolved.</p>

<h3 id="e111">Ningbo Industrial Bank, The First Voice of Resumption Movement, The Ningbo Industrial Bank Resumption Movement Committee Has Been Organized <a href="#e111" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c111" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">111</a></h3>
<p>With the approval of Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, the Ningbo Industrial Bank is instructed to negotiate with Minister Kong to resume business, and the future has a glimmer of hope. Yuan Duanfu, Chen Cuifu, Cao Guohua, Wu Zhihao, Yu Guozhen, Yang Songren, Guo Xuxu, Lin Kanghou, He Shaoyu, He Luting, Wang Beiping, Chen Zhonggao, Zhang Zilian, Wang Honglai, Xiang Shengwu, Wang Boyuan, and others have organized a resumption movement and issued a declaration. The original text of the declaration is recorded as follows: "The Ningbo Industrial Bank is one of the undertakings of our Ningbo people. Since its establishment, its purpose has been to support industry, promote domestic goods, and regulate finance. The person in charge, Mr. Wu Zhihao, is a leader among the leaders of our Ningbo people's undertakings. The suspension of the Ningbo Bank's receipt and remittance is not the same as speculation failures and embezzlement. Therefore, we feel sorry for the stranding of the bank, and thus the resumption movement is launched. There are three reasons for launching the movement: to maintain the interests of creditors, to maintain the reputation of our Ningbo people's undertakings, and to sympathize with Mr. Wu's efforts to save the country with domestic goods. Based on these three points, we will further study the feasibility of its resumption. There are three reasons that show us the possibility of resumption: (1) It is not difficult to resume the bank's business. The debt is only 710,000 yuan. If it can be resumed, the total assets and liabilities are 1.3 million yuan. Excluding the previous capital of 500,000 yuan, collecting accounts at half price can obtain 650,000 yuan, with a difference of 60,000 yuan owed to others. (2) Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will telegraph Minister Kong for relief and resumption of business on record. We think our fellow leaders should support the chairman's wishes and jointly participate in the resumption of business to save the country and the people. (3) The bank's creditors are mostly Ningbo merchants and officials, who have emotional feelings for the resumption of business. The bank has been suspended for more than a month, and the creditors' attitude has been unanimously sympathetic to the resumption of business. The heart of protecting hometown friendship is beyond our expectations. These three points have aroused our enthusiasm for the bank's resumption movement. Therefore, we gather like-minded people to form a sports association, with the bank's directors and supervisors as the main body, and leaders from all walks of life and creditors as guests. The host takes on the responsibilities that should be borne to lay the foundation for resumption, and the guests do their best to help and achieve a common goal. The gathering of Ningbo people's undertakings, the Ningbo Industrial Bank, the base camp for promoting domestic goods, the revival is in sight, and the left coupon can be held. Responsible directors and supervisors, enthusiastic creditors, and leaders from all walks of life who are eager for justice, if you do not believe our words, please join quickly. This announcement." And attached instructions on participating in the subscription: (1) All shareholders, supervisors, and directors of the bank: (A) For shareholders, in order to protect their previous capital, subscribe for new shares to protect their previous benefits. (B) For directors and supervisors, admit to maintaining the resumption of business and unloading responsibilities to protect their reputation. (2) Ningbo leaders and fellow villagers, in order to maintain the reputation of our Ningbo people's undertakings, subscribe for shares to help achieve resumption and complete the glory. (3) The bank's creditors, in order to protect themselves, subscribe for shares to help achieve its resumption, and all deposits are used as cash investment to avoid losses and facilitate the resumption. Regarding the above three points, the association has prepared a share subscription form to solicit subscriptions from all parties. After that, a meeting of subscribers will be convened to discuss it. If there is success, a resumption committee will be organized to carry out the resumption. If there is no considerable success and there is no possibility of resumption, the subscribed shares will be invalid. The association temporarily set up a preparatory office in the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association on Tibet Road. Initiators: Yuan Duanfu, Chen Cuifu, Cao Guohua, Wu Zhihao, Yu Guozhen, Yang Songren, Guo Xuxu, He Shaoyu, He Luting, Wang Beiping, Chen Zhonggao, Zhang Zilian, Lin Kanghou, Wang Honglai, Xiang Shengwu, Wang Boyuan, (Wang and Xiang joined in the capacity of fellow villagers), Zhou Yongsheng, jointly announced.</p>

A total of over 3 million yuan of one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan notes have been issued, as well as over 400,000 yuan of one-jiao and two-jiao subsidiary currency notes. In recent years, due to the development of its business, branches and offices have been established in important cities.

<p>In recent years, due to frequent disasters and rural bankruptcy, demobilized soldiers and refugees have been displaced in Songhu in increasing numbers. Although charitable organizations have tried to provide shelter, tens of thousands are still turned away, making the situation extremely dire. The Municipal Public Security Bureau, in order to provide a safe haven for these homeless demobilized soldiers and refugees and to improve the appearance of the city, has specially planned to build a large-scale shelter to accommodate as many as possible. The estimated cost is 50,000 yuan, which has been approved by the Municipal Government. The funds will be allocated from the municipal treasury. The location of the shelter has been jointly determined with the Municipal Land Bureau to be near the South Railway Station of the Shanghai Garrison, covering an area of about ten mu. The Municipal Public Security Bureau is now preparing to invite bids for construction. If the funds are insufficient in the future, charitable organizations will be asked to assist. Construction is expected to begin after the autumn cools, with completion scheduled for mid-October of this year.</p>

<p>Huangshan in Anhui Province has beautiful and magnificent scenery, surpassing all others in the world. Since the establishment of the Huangshan Construction Committee, it has been working hard on various construction projects, with a grand scale. The first phase of land leasing has been designated, and the number of lessees is increasing daily, almost overwhelming the committee. Recently, in order to promote public welfare, the committee has formulated measures to encourage investment in the construction of public economic housing. The committee will first allocate land for construction, and after the housing is completed, it will collect rent and registration fees according to regulations. The housing is divided into three types: A, B, and C. Type A occupies 60 square meters and costs 3,000 yuan to build. Type B occupies 30 square meters and costs 2,000 yuan to build. Type C occupies 15 square meters and costs 1,000 yuan to build. It is stipulated that the deadline for applying for investment in construction is the end of this year, and it cannot be taken as an example thereafter. It is also stipulated that investors should mutually elect representatives to form a Construction Management Committee with the committee to design and supervise the construction. The construction measures for the housing are very comprehensive and convenient for investors. It is reported that people from Nanjing, Anhui, and other places are eagerly applying for construction. If people from all walks of life in Shanghai want to invest in construction, they can directly contact the committee's Shanghai office at No. 78 Wanyi Lane, Luban Road, French Concession for consultation. The measures are appended below:</p>
<p>Temporary Measures for Encouraging Investment in the Construction of Huangshan Public Economic Housing</p>
<p>(1) The committee will designate the location of the residential area (first designate the various sub-areas of Taoyuan District and Ziyunji in the first residential area) and invite people to jointly invest in the construction of a number of public economic housing units. The committee and the representatives elected by the investors will jointly form a Construction Management Committee to design, build, and manage the project. The aforementioned Construction Management Committee will be dissolved after the construction is completed and the housing is divided. The committee will be responsible for supervising the receipt and expenditure of funds, the construction project, materials, and other matters of the Construction Management Committee, and investors are allowed to participate in the audit at any time. After the housing is completed, the investors will elect representatives to inspect and accept the project together with the engineers sent by the committee. (2) The committee will specially provide land for construction first, and the registration fees and land rent to be paid will be temporarily allowed to be deferred. After the construction is completed, the housing is divided, and the property rights are determined, the various fees will be paid according to regulations, and a lease license will be issued. (3) The construction of public housing by the committee is divided into three types: A, B, and C. Type A housing occupies 60 square meters and costs 3,000 yuan to build per unit. Type B housing occupies 30 square meters and costs 2,000 yuan to build per unit. Type C housing occupies 15 square meters and costs 1,000 yuan to build per unit. Investors may submit housing plans to the Construction Management Committee based on their own opinions or needs. (4) Investors who wish to build a certain type of housing should declare in advance when paying the funds. After the construction is completed, the corresponding properties will be distributed according to the amount of funds paid. (5) After the housing is divided, a lease license is obtained, and the property rights are determined, the property holder is allowed to sell or lease the property, but must not violate the committee's leasing regulations. (6) These measures are aimed at encouraging and promoting investment in construction and strive for universality. Their validity period is limited to this year (1935), and they cannot be taken as an example thereafter. (7) These measures will be implemented upon the resolution of the standing committee of the committee, and any unfulfilled matters may be proposed for modification at any time.</p>

The weather is very hot, but I am very honored that representatives from the municipal government, the municipal health bureau, and all the guests have enthusiastically participated. I will briefly report on the past situation of Rendan and the future improvement plans. Rendan began to be sold in 1916 and has been on the market for 20 years. During these 20 years, thanks to the efforts and struggles of the people in charge, it has become widely sold in the country and has even reached various ports in Southeast Asia. In addition to relieving suffering, it has also recovered a part of our rights. In the future, we should strive for excellence in our products, use scientific management, and seek mass production. With the past spirit of perseverance, we should persevere and adhere to it. Then, the revival of industry and commerce and the health of our physique will have great hope. I am willing to work hard with all sectors of society."

However, many people who ran under the scorching sun suffered from heatstroke. Therefore, heatstroke patients were found in various epidemic hospitals yesterday. As for the newly rising hurricane in the Pacific Ocean, it is currently east of Little Luzon and is heading northwest-west. If the direction does not change, it may reach Shanghai.</p>

<h3 id="e123">Overseas Chinese Association - Vigorously Fights Against Fare Increase - Provides Four Reasons for Objection and Asks Overseas Chinese Federation for Assistance <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Overseas Chinese Federation received a declaration from the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Association yesterday, asking for effective assistance in vigorously fighting against the fare increase. The original text says, "Xiamen is a trading port, and there are two aspects that give travelers the worst impression: 1. Boatmen take the opportunity to extort; 2. Ticket sales are manipulated and rare. The extortion of boatmen will be cracked down by the water police. The manipulation of ticket sales causes great pain to overseas Chinese. Although the evaluation committee was organized by various agencies last year, and the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau issued a crackdown, the crackdown is the crackdown, and the manipulation is the manipulation. If this kind of monopoly is not thoroughly eradicated, the overseas Chinese will suffer unnecessary sacrifices, and the new city will leave a huge stain. Only by working together from top to bottom, uniting internally and externally, removing the undue profits of a few people, pursuing the freedom and welfare of the majority, and expressing pure emotions, can we respond to the call for voice. If you agree, you will definitely help a lot. The points that should be fought for are listed below. Please be aware of them. (1) The global recession has spread throughout the islands of Southeast Asia. Our beloved overseas Chinese compatriots have already been forced to return to China. After arriving in their hometowns, they have suffered from the ravages of bandits and communists, and have therefore changed their properties and mortgaged their children to collect travel expenses and return to their countries in droves. The miserable situation is already heart-wrenching to speak of. However, upon arriving in the city, living expenses are not small, and buying tickets is full of twists and turns. After months of accumulation, some have exhausted their funds and returned to their hometowns crying, and some have taken out high-interest loans and made a desperate bet. All kinds of tragedies are not enough. In the eyes of the contractors, it is like robbing on the road, and in the eyes of the overseas Chinese, it is like being kidnapped in broad daylight. (It is found that the fare for each person stipulated by various shipping companies is 61 yuan, but when the contractors sell it, they charge from 120 yuan to 150 or 60 yuan.) The number of people exported from this port every year is estimated to be no less than tens of thousands. These tens of thousands of people groan under the extortion of ticket merchants, and the money wasted is a shocking number. The flow of people on the road, who will describe it? In terms of the suffering of overseas Chinese, this is the first thing that should be fought for. (2) People in the mainland cannot go abroad, so they must still return to their hometowns. When they return to their hometowns, their industries are exhausted, and they do not have the means to live, and they are hungry and cold. The father may not have his son, and how can the officials have their people? Therefore, it is not easy to eliminate bandits and communists in southern Fujian. Although it is related to the economic collapse and rural bankruptcy, there are also other reasons. However, those who are forced to go astray due to high fares and lack of progress account for at least a certain proportion. If this continues without thinking of reform, not only will the Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood be completely destroyed, but also the security of this port and the mainland will be in danger. In terms of local pacification, this is the second thing that should be fought for. (3) Overseas Chinese are the mother of the revolution, Sun Yat-sen often said. Therefore, the central authorities and local governments have been protecting overseas Chinese for a long time. However, when we look at the overseas Chinese living in various places, they are oppressed and expelled, and we hear about it every day. This is still a matter of national rights, and we are exhausted. Everyone understands it. If Xiamen is clearly a place where authority can reach, and ticket merchants are also people who can be controlled by government orders, if even this most common and shocking accumulation of poison cannot be eliminated, then there is not enough protection abroad, and this generation is allowed to bully at will in China. The inward-looking heart is discouraged, and the road to making a living is cut off. This association has no face to thank. What will the authorities say to explain themselves? In terms of government orders, this is the third thing that should be fought for. (4) It is found that the fare for going abroad in the past was only 10 yuan, and at most it reached more than 20 yuan. Since the issue of import restrictions, shipping companies took the opportunity to manipulate and uniformly set the price at 61 yuan, which has increased by two or three times compared to the past. If there were no contractors to fuel the flames, this pricing would be difficult to sustain. Now, the contractors are charging so much outside of the 61 yuan. Various companies are fortunate enough that the tickets are profitable and will not increase the price again. It is impossible to reduce them. It only increases the burden on overseas Chinese and increases the income of foreigners. What is the difference between harming the group and flattering foreigners? In terms of recovering rights, this is the fourth thing that should be fought for. In short, this association is organized by overseas Chinese in Fujian Province, and it speaks for overseas Chinese and does not ask about other things. We only ask that the contractors in the city do not hoard and sell tickets, and that overseas Chinese who go abroad can buy tickets freely. The goal is achieved, and we are satisfied. That's all. On the 13th of last month, it was the date of the executive committee meeting of this association. Due to public discussions and resolutions, we will report to the Central Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission on the method of treating both the symptoms and the root causes, and shout loudly to fulfill our duties. However, although this case should be fought for, our colleagues have no strength. Therefore, we disclose the situation and hope that the government authorities and various legal entities will support justice and provide effective assistance. We hereby declare solemnly and hope that everyone will understand."</p>

<p>The "North China Daily News" reported that the French Concession Board of Directors officially announced yesterday (13th) the design for the new French Concession Municipal Building. The first and second prizes of the competition were awarded to engineers from Ryan Engineering Firm in Shanghai. According to the competition rules, if there are not enough five competitors, only two prizes will be awarded. There were four competitors this time, and the judges decided to award the first and second prizes to Ryan Engineering Firm, with the first prize being 16,000 yuan and the second prize being 8,000 yuan. The French Concession Municipal Building will be built in the square between Avenue Joffre, Route Paul Henry, and Route Pichon. It was planned several years ago to make it the city center of the French Concession, but it has been postponed several times due to poor environmental conditions. It is expected that Ryan Engineering Firm will take at least six months to develop the details of the project before inviting bids. The new building is tall and square, with a garden outside and two rows of fountains on the left and right. The main entrance is on Avenue Joffre.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Tongren Fuyuan Hall Receives - A Letter from Someone Jumping into the River - Explains Clothing and Asks for Body to be Collected, the Coffin Head Inscribed with the Letters CVY <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall at No. 6 Ningbo Road, French Concession, received a letter from the 13th Post Office at 1:00 PM yesterday. Upon opening it, it was a Western-style letter paper (the envelope was also Western-style) with white background and blue horizontal stripes, stating that the writer was committing suicide by jumping into the river and requesting the collection of the body. It was written in pencil. The original text reads, "To all the gentlemen of Tongren Fuyuan Hall, I, due to various circumstances, am committing suicide and jumping into the river because there is no other way. When I am dying, I will be wearing a gray pongee long shirt, striped cotton short shirt, ramie short pants, silk knit undershirt, dark colored short pants, gray silk socks, and white canvas shoes. If the body is found, please inscribe the letters CVY on the coffin head when you collect it, or someone may come to claim it. As I am dying, I am overwhelmed with gratitude. Sincerely yours, respectfully, and wish you peace. Signed Yongren CVY (three Western letters) final note," etc. The letter was received by the General Post Office at 11:00 AM today and sent to the 13th District Post Office on Catholic Church Street for delivery. Because there was no address on the letter, it was impossible to investigate. The director of the hall, Mr. Guo Shaowen, sent someone to deliver the letter to the Nanshi Rescue Bureau to notify the rescue boatmen to pay attention to salvaging the body on the river surface.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Landlord Sued by Tenant for Fraud and Restriction of Freedom: Dispute Over 500 Yuan Deposit, Early Morning Harassment, Forced Eviction, and Roof Removal <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Ms. Shi Wu, a woman from Ningbo, recently hired attorney Zhang He-wo to file a complaint with the First Special Court against Li Wei-nong, the landlord of a property on Pike Road in Sui Zhi Lane, and his rental agent, Zhu Bao-sheng, accusing them of fraudulent acquisition of property and restriction of freedom. She also filed a private lawsuit seeking reimbursement of the 500 yuan deposit, 1 yuan for mental distress, and 400 yuan for decoration losses and relocation expenses. This morning, Judge Zhan Liang-ce presided over the court hearing, and both defendants, accompanied by their defense attorney Jiang Chi-ping, appeared. Ms. Shi Wu claimed that the defendant, Li Wei-nong, was the landlord of the property in Sui Zhi Lane. Last October, when the tenant of house number 21 moved out, her husband, Shi Zhi, rented the property from the defendant for a monthly rent of 78 yuan and signed a long-term lease. However, Li demanded a 500 yuan deposit as security for the rent. Her husband borrowed a check for 500 yuan from his friend Wang Sheng-he and handed it over, but no receipt was given at the time. On February 23rd of this year, she sent a double-registered letter to urge for the receipt, but the reply claimed that the 500 yuan paid was to cover the previous tenant's unpaid rent. Her husband was shocked and refuted the claim sternly. However, on May 11th, Li suddenly issued a notice stating that he was renovating the house and ordered them to move out. Her husband became ill from the shock and passed away on May 31st. In her grief, she was overwhelmed. Before she could settle the funeral arrangements and proceed with the lawsuit according to her husband's wishes, Li cut off the water supply on the morning of June 13th and instructed his rental agent, Zhu Bao-sheng, to break into her house, demanding that she move out within three days, or her furniture would be removed. She took Zhu to the Xin Zha police station and requested that he be prosecuted in court. Unsatisfied, Li returned the following afternoon with a police officer and broke into her house without cause, threatening her to move out. The roof of the house she currently occupies has been removed by the defendants. Recently, during the rainy season, the clothes and furniture are often soaked by leaks. She requested that the construction be stopped. When questioned, Li Wei-nong stated that part of the house had collapsed on March 24th of this year, injuring a child. The child's family filed a lawsuit, and he paid 5 yuan for medical expenses to settle the matter. He claimed that the house was old and dilapidated and posed a public hazard, so he ordered it to be demolished. He stated that the 500 yuan he received was paid by the plaintiff's husband on behalf of the former tenant, Wu Zhao-sheng, to cover old debts. Because Wu owed several months of rent and had secretly sublet the house to the plaintiff's husband, Shi Er-bin, he sued Wu in court and obtained a judgment ordering him to repay the old debts, but the eviction was not allowed. Subsequently, the plaintiff's husband intervened and mediated, renting the house to Shi Er-bin and having Shi pay the old debts of 500 yuan on behalf of Wu. He claimed that the money was collected by lawyer Ma Le-ming. Judge Zhan stated that the case required further investigation and adjourned the hearing.</p>
<h3 id="e128">Fire at a Lumberyard on Temple Back Road in Zhabei: Spreads to Over 200 Thatched Houses, Difficulty in Obtaining Water for Extinguishing Leads to Tragedy, Impoverished People Face the Disaster Area with Sorrowful Faces <a href="#e128" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c128" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">128</a></h3>
<p>Shun Tai Lumberyard, located at number 304 Temple Back Road in Zhabei, has been in business for many years. Behind it were more than two hundred thatched houses, home to about three hundred impoverished families from Jiangbei. However, as the addresses had not yet been numbered, there were no statistics. Recently, the weather had been extremely hot, and the impoverished people could not endure living in the huts, so most of them slept in the open space in front of their doors. Unexpectedly, at around 3:00 AM this morning, a fire suddenly broke out in the lumber piles of the Shun Tai Lumberyard. Due to the dry weather, the lumber, once ignited, burned as if fueled by oil. Aided by the wind, the fire spread throughout the lumberyard in no time. At the same time, sparks flew everywhere, landing on the thatched huts behind the lumberyard, causing them to catch fire as well. In an instant, the sky was filled with red light, and the fire spread in all directions. Fortunately, the impoverished people sleeping outside the huts were awakened by the fire and frantically called out to their families inside the huts to escape. They rushed to move their belongings, helping the old and carrying the young, causing chaos. The workers in the Shun Tai Lumberyard also scrambled to escape, while reporting to the police officers on duty. The report was relayed to the Ji Xiang Road Branch Police Station and the Hu Jia Mu Qiao Fire Brigade, who dispatched police officers and fire engines to control and extinguish the fire. However, there were no fire-fighting facilities in the area, so the fire brigades used hoses to draw water from the river near the Qi Mei Road Bridge. But the fire had already spread to all of the thatched huts, making it uncontrollable. Although the firefighters fought bravely, the fire was not completely extinguished until around 7:00 AM. All the thatched huts had been burned to the ground, leaving nothing behind. The impoverished people faced the disaster area with sorrowful faces. The situation was extremely tragic. At the same time, a man from Taizhou named Xia Yuan-kun, who was slow to escape, suffered burns to his left leg and was unable to move. In addition, more than ten others suffered minor injuries and were sent to the hospital for treatment after the incident. Shun Tai Lumberyard also suffered significant losses. The owner of the lumberyard was summoned to the police station on the same day to be questioned about the cause of the fire, so as to investigate the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e129">The Inside Story of a Suicide Pact in the North China Apartments: Tang Mengxia Ungratefully Seduced the Wife of a Friend, and Lian Xiao-shi Was Immoral and Ashamed of Her Two Children and Husband <a href="#e129" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c129" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">129</a></h3>
<p>The North China Apartments, located at number 431, the intersection of Rue Massenet and Rue des Soeurs in the French Concession, witnessed a tragic double suicide of a man and a woman on the afternoon of the previous day. Yesterday’s newspaper had provided a brief account of it. The following is a more detailed account of what happened. Lian Yao-sheng, a man from Suzhou, was 23 years old and married Xiao-shi, also from the same hometown, who was also 23 years old. They had been married for six years and had two sons: Dong-nan, who was 5 years old, and Fang-nan, who was just five months old. Lian used to work as a driver for the Da Zhong Automobile Company at number 350 Rue Lafayette in the French Concession. Recently, he had stopped working and was unemployed. He and his wife, Xiao-shi, lived at number 1125 Xiao Sha Du Road in western Shanghai. Because</p>
<p>something didn’t work out,</p>
<p>he switched to running a wonton and snack stall to make a living. When Lian was driving for the Da Zhong Automobile Company, he became close friends with Tang Mengxia (whose courtesy name was Ji-lun, and who was 22 years old), who was the company's accountant. Tang's father was a businessman in another city. His mother, Wang-shi, was 38 years old and had remarried and lived at number 61 Rue Amiral Bayle. Tang was educated and had graduated from middle school. He severed his relationship with his mother. Tang often visited his mother under the guise of being a relative, staying only for a brief moment. Tang was dismissed from his position as an accountant at Da Zhong Automobile Company for embezzling six or seven hundred yuan. He became unemployed, and his living conditions became extremely difficult. In the third month of the lunar calendar of this year, he even</p>
<p>went without food for two days.</p>
<p>With nowhere to turn, he thought of his old friend Lian Yao-sheng, who was now running a small business and doing relatively well. So, he sought refuge with Lian, asking for his help and offering to help with the business in exchange for a place to eat. He hoped that would be enough and planned to find another way out later. Lian couldn't refuse out of friendship and agreed to take him in. Tang lived and ate at Lian's house, helping Lian with the business during the day. Who knew that after a long time, Tang would become a beast in human clothing, repaying kindness with revenge. When Lian was not at home, Tang seduced Lian's wife, Xiao-shi, with flattering words and actions. Xiao-shi, being young and naive, fell into his trap, and their affair began about twenty days ago. Lian then</p>
<p>discovered the truth</p>
<p>and rebuked Tang righteously. Tang also knew that he had betrayed his friend's trust. On the ninth of this month, he resigned from Lian's house. Lian's wife, Xiao-shi, also learned that the secret had been exposed and begged her husband for forgiveness, promising to break off the relationship with Tang from then on. Lian, seeing that his wife was remorseful and that it was not appropriate to make the scandal public, let it go and instructed her to take good care of the two children and not to dwell on the past. On the eleventh, Xiao-shi took her two sons and her husband to visit her older sister's house. That night, she wanted to stay overnight at her sister's house, so Lian took their eldest son home first. However, Tang, though he had left Lian's house, was still not over it. Before leaving, he had made an appointment with Xiao-shi. So, on the evening of the eleventh, he called Xiao-shi's sister's neighbor, a coppersmith, from the Da Zhong Automobile Company, inviting</p>
<p>Xiao-shi out.</p>
<p>Xiao-shi received the message, and that night, carrying her five-month-old son, Fang-nan, she went to the Da Zhong Automobile Company to meet Tang. At 10:00 PM, they went to the North China Apartments, where Tang used the alias Wang En, and she used the alias Feng Qiu-xin, claiming to be a couple, and booked room number 15 for the night. The next day, Tang had no good plan to accommodate Xiao-shi and her children. Xiao-shi was too ashamed to go home to face her husband. The two decided to commit suicide. On the evening of the twelfth, they stayed at the apartments for one night. After Tang bought two boxes of raw opium, he first wrote two pairs of suicide notes in pencil. One was addressed to Xiao-shi's husband, Lian Yao-sheng, informing him of their suicide and apologizing. The other was addressed to the owner of the Da Zhong Automobile Company, requesting that he inform</p>
<p>his mother to collect the body.</p>
<p>After writing and mailing the letters, the two swallowed the raw opium and lay down to wait for death. At 1:00 PM on the thirteenth, they were discovered by the tea boy, but it was too late to save them. On the morning of the twelfth, Lian Yao-sheng did not see Xiao-shi return home, so he rushed to her sister's house to look for her. He learned that she had left with Lian the night before. Knowing that his wife had run away, Lian reported it to the Pu Tuo Road police station, asking them to investigate. At noon on the thirteenth, he received Tang's suicide note sent by the post office. He rushed to the North China Apartments to investigate. When he arrived at the apartments, the French police were carrying Xiao-shi onto a car to take her to Guang Ci Hospital, but she died before she could be saved. The owner of the Da Zhong Automobile Company also received</p>
<p>Tang's suicide note.</p>
<p>At this time, he went to the North China Apartments to inquire. The police learned Tang's mother's address and sent detectives to inform her. They sent the bodies of the man and woman to the Tong Ren Fu Yuan mortuary for autopsy. Yesterday, they reported to the Second Special Court. Prosecutor Wang Ren, along with forensic doctor Wei and clerk Peng, examined the bodies at noon and ascended the court. Detective Zhang Chun-sheng reported the case details. Then, Shang Xiu-feng, the tea boy of the North China Apartments, described how he discovered the bodies. Tang's mother, Wang-shi, testified that Meng-xia was her son. After he followed his father to study, he worked as an accountant at the automobile company. She had been separated from him for four or five years. He had not yet married. She now wished to</p>
<p>collect the body for burial.</p>
<p>Lian Yao-sheng also testified about how he took in Tang Mengxia and how he resigned after discovering his improper behavior. After his wife ran away, he reported it to the police. Yesterday, he received a letter and rushed to the North China Apartments. She (referring to his wife) was already dead. After questioning, the official ruled that Tang Meng (alias Wang En) and Lian Xiao-shi (alias Feng Qiu-xin) had both died of poisoning before death. The bodies were handed over to Tang Wang-shi and Lian Yao-sheng for burial. The two opium boxes, each containing some opium, were confiscated. After the examination, the two families were allowed to collect the bodies. The child left behind by Xiao-shi is currently being temporarily fostered by the police at Guang Ci Hospital. Tomorrow, he will be transferred to the Second Special Court for instructions and handed over to his father for upbringing.</p>
<h3 id="e130">Public Security Bureau Orders Subordinates to Prohibit Wearing Exposed Chests and Barebacks: Walking Along the Streets Impairs the City Appearance, Violators Will Be Punished According to the Law <a href="#e130" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c130" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">130</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the weather has been extremely hot, and some citizens have been wearing exposed chests and barebacks while walking along the streets to cool off. This kind of habit not only impairs the city appearance, but it is also not in accordance with hygiene. Therefore, Cai Jin-jun, the Director of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, specifically ordered all branch bureaus and police stations to strictly prohibit such behavior. The original order stated: “According to the report submitted by the Supervisory Office, in recent days, as the weather is gradually getting hotter, some citizens have been wearing exposed chests and barebacks while walking along the streets in order to cool off, especially various workers and rickshaw pullers. Not only is this behavior not allowed by the New Life Movement, but the police regulations also have clear laws prohibiting it. However, during my inspections, I found that the aforementioned situation exists everywhere, which is detrimental to the city's appearance, customs, and hygiene. I propose that all branch bureaus and police stations be ordered to instruct their chiefs and New Life Guidance Teams to pay close attention to guiding and prohibiting such behavior, so as to rectify customs and comply with the New Life Movement.” Based on this, it is necessary to strictly prohibit wearing exposed chests and barebacks while walking along the streets, as it impairs the city appearance. If anyone dares to deliberately violate this order, they should be punished according to the police regulations. In addition to issuing separate orders, you are hereby ordered to comply with this order and instruct your subordinates to pay close attention to guiding and prohibiting such behavior. This order is hereby issued.</p>

<p>In January of this year, the Yuan Yuan steamship, insured by the American company Mullens Insurance and the British company Public Utility Sun Insurance, was fully loaded with goods and was sailing from Luonan to Langshan waters when it encountered danger and sank. Everyone on board was rescued and survived, but the cargo drifted away completely. Afterwards, Zhu Hui-shi, Zhu Zhi-an, Zhang A-fu, Wu Niang-fa, and others hired workers to salvage three hundred loads of gypsum and twenty-eight cans of mercury from the site of the accident and sold them at a good price. This was discovered by Mullens Insurance and others, who commissioned their employee Bai Lang (a British national) as their legal representative and hired lawyer Lin Ying-qing to draft a complaint to the District Court Prosecutor's Office. After investigation, Prosecutor Li Fen concluded the case and filed a public prosecution against the defendants for the crime of embezzlement. After a public trial, the court declared its verdict: the defendants jointly embezzled the drifted goods of others and were each fined one hundred yuan. In the civil lawsuit portion, the defendants were ordered to jointly return three hundred loads of gypsum and twenty-eight cans of mercury to the American company Mullens Insurance and the British company Public Utility Sun Insurance. The defendants, dissatisfied with the verdict, legally presented their reasons and filed an appeal with the original court for a re-hearing.</p>

<h3 id="e132">The Recent Injuries of Two Policemen Injured During Arrests: Liu Junshan Still Out of Danger, Chen Yilong Is Likely to Recover <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>Police officers Liu Junshan and Chen Yilong of the Xundao Street Police Station were on duty at their posts on Zixia Road and Gao Hang Tou in the South City on the morning of the tenth of this month, around 9:00 AM, when they suddenly heard that a robbery was taking place on Yuelai Street. The police officers rushed to the scene to make arrests but the robbers preemptively shot and injured the two police officers, who were sent to the hospital for treatment. The robbers escaped without a trace, as reported in previous newspapers. It is now reported that Liu Junshan, who is being treated at the Nanyang Hospital in Xiaodongmen, suffered a gunshot wound that entered through his ribs. Doctors managed to extract the bullet from Liu's back. However, the bullet had passed through the internal organs, liver, and kidneys, making abdominal surgery difficult. As the injury was internal, the doctors found it very difficult to perform surgery. After days of careful treatment, there has been slight improvement, turning the situation from dangerous to stable. When Liu first entered the hospital, he was in pain and fainted several times due to the extreme pain. He was frequently given painkillers to help him wake up and sleep for a while. Initially, he needed more than ten injections a day. Over the past few days, his painful condition has slightly reduced, but he is still not out of danger. Chen Yilong, who is being treated at Shanghai Hospital, has injuries to his arms and legs. He is recovering every day and is likely to recover completely. He will probably be discharged from the hospital in another week. Yesterday afternoon, Chief Jin Dianyang instructed police chief Wang Zuoxian to visit Liu Junshan at Nanyang Hospital to check on his injuries and to inquire with the doctor about his progress. If there are no changes, there is generally no fear for his life. Police chief Wang comforted Liu Junshan repeatedly before leaving. He then went to Shanghai Hospital to observe Chen Yilong's injuries. Although he had three or four injuries, they were not serious. He instructed him to rest quietly and then returned to the station to report the situation to Chief Jin.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Pharmacists Association held its general membership meeting at 2:00 PM yesterday at its clubhouse on Tongfu Road. The meeting was to re-elect executive and supervisory committee members and to pass several important resolutions. Details as follows:</p>
<p>Members Present</p>
<p>Chu Minyi, Shen Zhongmou, Zou Jianxiong, He Xiachun, Wang Fushen, Zhang Jianqing, Zheng Jichen, Yang Fuchang, Zhang Fuzhong, Xu Wenfu, Cao Zhigong, Wu Guanmin, Wei Guijian, Zhu Hanmin, Pan Wenshun, Zhu Buqiu, Jia Yishan, Zheng Mengling, Rong Shanxian, Zhong Xinren, Zhao Mindiao, Qiu Shaobai, Shen Jing, He Zikang, Qin Zhenshan, Zhu Zhujun, Zhong Zhiqi (representative of the Bureau of Health), Mao Yun (representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters), Yu Hegui, Dai Ke'an, Zhou Mengbai, Lin Hongzao, Wang Lifu,</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>After performing the rituals, Chairman Chu Minyi delivered an opening speech, stating, "Science has no borders, and new medicine is a product of science. Chinese medicine has a history of thousands of years, but it has made no progress due to its conservative nature. Therefore, the mission of the members present today is very important. It goes without saying that the countries with advanced modern science have brilliant medical systems, and the health of the people is better guaranteed as a result. Many great people throughout history have engaged in medicine. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founder of the Republic of China, studied pharmacy in his youth. I personally hope that the Shanghai Pharmaceutical Association can gradually expand and advance to organize a national pharmaceutical association, and even further to organize a world pharmaceutical association. I have high hopes for this." Next, Cao Zhigong reported on the association's affairs, and Zhou Mengbai reported on its finances.</p>
<p>Representative's Speech</p>
<p>Mao Yun, the representative of the Municipal Party Headquarters, delivered a speech, saying, "All of you present at the meeting today are pioneers in the field of new medicine in China. I am a layman when it comes to medicine, so I dare not say much. Where there is life, there must be disease, so human beings cannot escape medicine. Medicine is closely related to human health. Whether a country is prosperous and strong depends on whether its people are healthy. Without a healthy body, it is impossible to engage in revolution or any service. Our country has long been known as the 'sick man of East Asia,' which is a great shame for our nation. I hope that all the members present will work together to overcome this shame. I not only hope that the members can use their abilities to treat diseases, but also prevent and eliminate them. Shanghai occupies a leading position in the country, and the responsibilities you shoulder are a model for the new medicine field in the whole country, which is extremely important. I sincerely wish your association can grow and develop, so that the new medicine in the whole country has a model to follow." Next, Zhong Zhiqi, the representative of the Bureau of Social Affairs, delivered a speech, offering many words of encouragement. The speech was lengthy and will not be detailed here.</p>
<p>Newly Elected Committee Members</p>
<p>Executive Committee: Wu Guanmin, Cao Zhigong, Zhou Mengbai, Shen Zhongmou, Wang Fuzhong, Zhao Zhongyuan, Qiu Shaobai, Zhang Fuzhong, Liu Buqing. Alternate Executive Committee Members: Zhu Yuquan, Zheng Xun, Zou Jianxiong. Supervisory Committee: Chu Minyi, Jia Yishan, Dai Boling. Alternate Supervisory Committee Member: Ye Shuihan.</p>
<p>Important Resolutions Passed</p>
<p>(1) A resolution to increase membership dues to four yuan per year was passed. (2) A resolution to request the Bureau of Social Affairs to require all pharmacists opening pharmacies in the city to first join the association when applying for business licenses was passed. (3) A resolution that the association should request the government to formulate a law on pharmacists associations was passed. (4) A request from pharmacists Chen Yin and others to request (A) flexible licensing, and (B) whether they can join the association was resolved. The first request was accepted and handed over to the next executive committee for handling. The second request was politely rejected based on the association's constitution and the pharmacists regulations.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency: Following the Great China Celluloid Factory disaster on Xiao Sha Du Road in Western Shanghai, and the subsequent fires in Yongqing Lane, the families of the victims, in order to prevent the factory from moving the goods, have caused two more incidents and have remained at the factory for four days. Because a concrete solution has not been reached, they have decided to start a hunger strike today. The Family Support Association, because the case has already been handed over to a lawyer to file a lawsuit according to law, and the court should have a proper solution, sent representatives to the factory last night to dissuade the families. There are still 44 injured residents who have not been examined, and the Support Association will send representatives to accompany them to the First Special Court today to request injury examinations.</p>

<h3 id="e136">Young Magician Cui Xingzhou Invited to Japan <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Young magician Cui Xingzhou, who once aspired to travel the world performing, made his debut at the Carlton Theater. It was originally intended as a farewell performance for his countrymen. However, during a certain performance, his assistant deliberately acted slow and clumsy, revealing the secrets of his transformations. Although discerning people knew that the fault did not lie with Cui, it still had an impact on the reputation of Cui's entire Lingte Wan Magic Troupe. At the time, Cui did not make any statement. Upon returning to Beijing after the contract expired, he immediately dismissed all of the assistants in the group, so as to select excellent students and retrain them. Once they are proficient, he will consider going abroad again. It is also heard that Shi, an overseas Chinese in Japan who was a classmate of Cui, recently telegraphed to invite Cui to visit new and emerging magic in Japan, so as to provide assistance. If necessary, Cui may be asked to give a personal performance. Therefore, Cui is scheduled to depart for Japan within a few days.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Municipal First Special District People's United Association Fifteenth and Thirty-sixth Branch Association held a joint rent reduction movement meeting at 2:00 PM the afternoon before yesterday. Committee members Zhu Zhichun, Jiang Zonghai, Lu Rongtang, and representatives Ge Zuying, Zhou Juqing, Xu Youji, Xin Yuansen, and others, more than twenty people in all, attended. Standing committee member Xu Kaixian was publicly elected as chairman. After reporting on the purpose of the meeting and the progress of negotiations, the representatives of the Fifteenth and Thirty-sixth Branch Associations reported on the course of events. Next, the representative of Xintai'an Lane, Guangyuanxiang, reported that he had contacted Mr. Mi, the representative of the landlord Bei Runsheng, and had received a verbal reply, agreeing to a 10% rent reduction for residents and a 20% reduction for businesses. After discussion, (1) because the original rents for the street-facing businesses and residents in Xintai'an Lane were different for each building, a 20% rent reduction was still unfair. The businesses still requested that the association take charge. It was resolved that representatives Qiu Minzhong, He Zhifa, Chen Defa, Ni Songnian, Jiang Zonghai, and others would further negotiate with the landlord to reduce the rent and request a definite implementation date. (2) The representative of De'an Lane reported on the reasons for the rent reduction and requested the association to send a letter to the landlord expressing their position. The resolution was passed. At the end of the meeting, other motions were discussed and dismissed.</p>

Furthermore, she was unable to walk due to pain throughout her body. She urgently requested Mr. Li to treat her. After only three days of treatment, Mr. Li could ask the patient to move, and she would move; ask her to get up, and she would get up; ask her to walk, and she would walk. In an instant, the pain vanished. Mrs. Fan, upon rising from her long illness, even called Mr. Li a divine person. Yesterday, the wife of Mr. Yang Youheng of the Second Special District Court suffered from stomach pain and vomiting, which was ineffective despite medication. He extended an invitation to Li for treatment, and she also reported immediate relief. His rapid healing is rarely seen.

As a result, more guests thronged, numbering over a thousand. Fortunately, the club's location was spacious enough to accommodate them. Last night's weather was even hotter than before. The audience, drinking ice and watching the opera under electric fans, still felt like they were sweating profusely, so unbearable was the heat. However, the actors, in their heavy costumes and thick makeup, were still able to sing and perform seriously, never slacking off from beginning to end. If they were not deeply skilled and seasoned, how could they have achieved this? It is reported that the club has now begun recruiting new members.

<p>Tongyi Famous Medicine Company Sells Licorice Paste to Quit Smoking. The harm of opium is more severe than fierce beasts and floods. Addicts not only ruin their families, destroy their careers, and die without descendants, but also directly cause the entire nation and people to perish. China's weakness to this point is also mainly due to the harm of opium. Since Chairman Chiang issued a strict order to ban it within a time limit, the news has spread, and addicts everywhere are uneasy. However, quitting smoking requires the effectiveness of medicines to achieve twice the result with half the effort. Now, the Licorice Paste sold by Tongyi Famous Medicine Circulation Company in Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao, can quit smoking. The medicine is mild and has no side effects. According to actual clinical results, it is extremely effective. It is said that each bottle sells for only 3 jiao, which is truly a savior for those who are sinking into the sea of darkness.</p>

<h3 id="e149">Incoming Letter: Preface to the Photographic Reprint of the Song Dynasty Tripitaka Treasures <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Ye Gongchuo</p>
<p>In July of the 24th year of the Republic of China, the "Song Dynasty Tripitaka Treasures" was printed, comprising 46 types of ancient Buddhist texts preserved in isolation, divided into 120 volumes, categorized into upper, middle, and lower collections, and circulated both domestically and internationally. I hereby briefly describe the cause and origin of its printing and distribution as a preface to the beginning of the volumes: Initially, the Shanghai Photographic Reprint of the Song Dynasty Tripitaka Sutra Society commissioned the monk Fancheng to seek out the Qisha edition of the Song Dynasty Tripitaka. Upon arriving at the Guangsheng Temple in Zhaocheng, Shanxi, this sutra was discovered. They were surprised by it. The yellow-papered, vermilion-axised texts were all in scroll form, abundantly filling six cabinets. They invited Xu Senzhi, a lay Buddhist from Beiping, to examine it. He identified it as the Jin Dynasty Tripitaka, which had never been recorded. More than 5,000 scrolls were extant. It originally belonged to the Taiping Xingguo Chan Temple in Kaocheng County, Suizhou. According to the inscriptions, the Dazangjing edition engraving association of Tianning Temple in Jiezhou created the carving during the Jin Dynasty Huangtong era. There were also additions during the early Yuan Dynasty. Each plate was printed on one sheet of paper, and the sheets were accumulated into scrolls, with each scroll containing from 13 to 32 sheets. The sheets contained from 22 to 31 lines, and each line contained from 14 to 27 characters. These were not consistent. Moreover, some of the sutras and commentaries that were carved were not present in the Song Dynasty Qisha Tripitaka, nor were they present in the Yuan, Ming, or Qing Dynasty Tripitakas. The volumes that were absent from the various Tripitakas were urgently photographed and reprinted to be released to the world, named the "Song Dynasty Tripitaka Treasures," to show that we do not forget its origin. Alas, our country's Buddhist texts are richly recorded, so why was this majestic and massive work, which existed in a culturally prosperous area of the Jin Dynasty, not recorded? It is like an ancient monk entering deep meditation, sitting alone amidst the clouds, wind, grass, and trees, silently not seeking to be known by others. After hundreds of years, when the time and conditions converged, it began to reveal its true appearance to people. There is probably a reason for this. Now, since its proclamation, domestic and foreign figures have continuously followed in each other's footsteps to explore Zhaocheng, with the lay Buddhist Jiang Weixin being especially diligent. The influence of this is already widespread. As for its value, it is very significant in terms of academic research, and each person should assess it based on their needs. Gu Gongchuo, therefore, further imagines that the long-hidden bright pearls of our country's Buddhism, scattered among the layers of mountains and rivers, are indeed numerous. If each person earnestly and energetically seeks them, they will surely be continuously discovered. In the future, we should compile these various editions, remove the identical parts, preserve the differences, select the good parts, and eliminate the bad parts to publish a Tripitaka of the Republic of China to greatly benefit the Dharma realm and create a permanent record. I, therefore, write this to wish for it.</p>

<p>— (Lan Shan)</p>
<p>The pilots of airplanes and ships are truly admirable and lovable heroes. The sea is wide for fish to leap, and the sky is high for birds to fly. They control the lives of all the passengers, and their own lives are also in their hands. They soar in all directions, riding the long winds and breaking through myriad waves. This kind of heroic act cannot be done by those who lack courage and self-confidence. What a heavy load! What a joyous thing!</p>
<p>If you hope to be a good leader in the future, you must now strive to be a good follower. Similarly, if you want to be someone who is not despised by people, then do not be petty about seeking fame and reputation.</p>
<p>Previously, when it had not rained for a long time and the fields were cracked, people worried about the arrival of drought demons. But after several days of moldy rain and mountain floods, many places were experiencing floods. Although this can be said to be the work of heaven, the most important crux is that the usual lack of water conservancy means that there is no way to cope at this critical juncture.</p>

<p>— Mustard Seed</p>
<p>Li Shangyin, a poet of the Tang Dynasty, whose poems in various styles throughout the ages lament the times and wound the world, deeply understood the meaning of the Book of Songs. The Xikun style is still imitated by many today. Mustard Seed and a friend recently went to an old bookstore in the city temple and purchased a volume of Li's "Yu Xi Miscellany." The hidden words and pure phrases are a wonderful piece of writing! The book is a Jigu Pavilion edition, rarely circulated in the market. I love to extract several excerpts to fill the Spring and Autumn, and I think it will also be a pleasure for readers to read.</p>
<p>Good parents have no good children, a virtuous woman marries a stupid man, a family has books but cannot read them, and one goes to bed early on a bright moonlit night. This is called "injustice." Inviting distinguished guests who do not come, evil guests who come uninvited, sitting with enemies, and encountering creditors when going out. This is called "boredom." Avoiding other people's taboos, not talking much after drinking, not getting close to villains, and not arguing with fools. This is called "intelligence." Following others without asking for reasons, not distinguishing right from wrong, scolding people without explaining the reasons first, and letting sons keep birds in cages. This is called "lack of knowledge." Braving the heat to greet someone, enduring pain to cauterize with moxa, resigning from office due to old age and illness, and scolding beloved pets for the sake of a fierce wife. This is called "helplessness." A fat man in the summer months, a long journey in the heat, a leaking boat in the rain, and an evil wife in the house. This is called "unbearable." Cutting things with a dull knife, having no wine when the flowers are in bloom, the shade of trees blocking the scenery, and holding a banquet facing away from the wind in the hot months. This is called "unpleasant." Holding a fire under the moon, tethering horses to stone bamboo shoots, building a building against the mountain, and shedding tears when looking at flowers. This is called "killing the scenery." A fat man marrying a new wife, a butcher chanting scriptures, and an old man entering a flower garden. This is called "unfitting." Being able to eat coarse food when hungry, getting a small boat when traveling urgently, and stopping in a small house when it rains. This is called "not minding."</p>
<h3 id="e152">Laundress <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Bing Ding</p>
<p>In this day and age, all occupations, whether male or female, are showing a "sharpening" trend. Is it following Darwin's path of "survival of the fittest" and "natural selection?" Or is it due to the declining morals of the world and the fading hearts of people? As long as one can find a bowl of rice and earn money, there is no need to ask about the means. The ferocious faces and despicable behaviors are truly beyond words.</p>
<p>A few years ago, women's occupations were often mentioned in grand and eloquent articles, wasn't it reasoned and well-founded? But now, women's occupations are really hard to say.</p>
<p>Let's not talk about anything else, just talk about the laundresses. In our ×× building, there are at least seventy or eighty company offices. Every morning, there are more than a dozen modernly dressed young women in their teens and twenties, carrying clothes bags, twisting and turning, coming to the offices to ask if there are any clothes to wash. One leaves, and another comes. This is usually the case. However, frivolous young fellows deliberately flirt and tease with vulgar words. They even start to touch each other. The laundress also flirts and scolds, making many ugly gestures to pluck the heartstrings of the frivolous youths.</p>
<p>The laundress in our company is called "Old Woman" by colleagues. At first, I didn't see the laundress. I heard that her name was "Old Woman," and I imagined her to be a person with wrinkled skin and white hair, or at least someone in her forties or fifties. One day at 8:00 in the morning, I walked into the company office and saw a seventeen- or eighteen-year-old girl flirting with our colleagues. Only then did I realize that the so-called "Old Woman" was this woman. It turned out that the laundry business in our company was done by her mother-in-law. Later, because some of the business was taken away by other laundresses, some said that the old woman did not wash clean, and others said that she did not iron evenly. The old woman received a lot of criticism and suddenly understood the crux of the problem. Knowing that she was old and worthless, she had to quickly change the way she ran the laundry business. She only did the washing work at home, and her daughter-in-law took on the job of running the streets, and the business became better day by day.</p>

<p>I then told her that the color of the painting board in Jingli was too similar to the color of the flowers, which would not only fail to highlight the beauty of the flowers but also affect the painting board. I talked incessantly, not noticing the expression on her face. In fact, she did not have a smile at all at that time. But in the end, she adopted my opinion.</p>
<p>"Since that's the case, then place it elsewhere according to your wishes!"</p>
<p>Of course, I was very happy and quickly used my aesthetic vision to find a suitable place for this bottle of fresh flowers. The Empress Dowager looked at it and seemed to feel that after such a change, the color tone of the whole room was indeed much more harmonious. Although she did not praise it, she did not express any dissatisfaction. This incident passed like this.</p>
<p>Soon after, I had forgotten about this incident, and the Empress Dowager would certainly not remember it either. I was simply confused until the very end, when I finally realized that if this incident were strictly discussed, I would have committed a crime! How did I know this? It was because on this day—the day the Empress Dowager invited four imperial physicians to diagnose her illness—I boldly committed the same mistake for the second time, and I was reminded.</p>
<p>That evening, because the Empress Dowager had been dozing for an hour or two after taking medicine, the chills and fever had subsided a lot. But the rain was still falling outside, and the Empress Dowager was sitting in the palace feeling very bored. In addition, her cough was still bothering her, which made her even more annoyed.

<p>— Ying Weisheng</p>
<p>If words are the tool for expressing thoughts and feelings, then letters are the tool for storing and releasing the tool for expressing thoughts and feelings, like a gramophone that subtly contains all kinds of rhythms interwoven with joy and sorrow. Especially for people who are alone in different places, exchanging letters and communicating their feelings is like a kind of intangible spiritual comfort.</p>
<p>However, in this complex society, there are too many shameless things that randomly open other people's letters like thieves who block the road. If you live upstairs, the postman's letters are often crowded. Once they are thrown downstairs, those thick-skinned people will randomly open them as if they were printed matter. Although they do not understand other people's words at all, they always bite them like little mice, regardless of whether they can eat them or not. Then, they simply throw them into the wastepaper basket like newspapers.</p>
<p>Damn it! If they come across a pictorial sent by someone else, they are even more like mice staring greedily, their eyes slippery and ingratiating as they answer your questions.</p>
<p>This, B, for the sake of friendship with A, has to consider A's relationship with C. Therefore, B cannot openly fall out with C and has to endure it. However, C is even more shameless and unscrupulous.</p>
<p>One's own small mailbox cannot be used, and there is not even the possibility of placing it there. Obviously, behind those ingratiating, slippery eyes, there are even more wrists that want to stir up trouble. Causing resentment is inevitable.</p>
<p>Heavenly principles, national laws, and human feelings are the bound-feet of the modern-day social structure network! In addition to C's lack of morality and A and B's inability to break through the network of human relations, the only compromise solution is for the postal authorities to manufacture a batch of standard mailboxes of suitable sizes to accommodate newspapers and ordinary mail, charge a reasonable cost, and distribute them near the escalators of people living upstairs in urban areas.</p>

<p>Zhiqian somewhat regretted it. People were already extremely uncomfortable, so why add another stimulus? He decided not to leave and see what would happen. After a while, he coughed twice in a very depressed manner. He picked up the handle of the teapot on the table, wanting to pour tea, and turned his face around. His head was originally lowered, so he only saw his hair, which seemed a little disheveled. He slowly raised his face, looking directly at Zhiqian. There, at the corner of his nose and eyes, were two lines of tears, rolling down the two straight, slanted lines on his cheekbones. At this time, he was not avoiding Zhiqian's gaze, but staring blankly at him, as if his countless unspeakable secrets were being expressed in his blank face and two lines of tears. Zhiqian put down the newspaper and stared blankly at him. However, this place was a thoroughfare for people coming and going from several courtyards, so there were many people passing by. When a traveler passed by, Zhiqian immediately thought that Yueying was already someone else's family member, so what right did he have to express this kind of sorrowful attitude to her? So, he pretended not to see her, pushed the newspaper to the center of the table, lowered his head, and sighed softly. Unexpectedly, Yueying saw even this extremely subtle movement very clearly. At this moment, he saw him put down the teapot with a bang, suddenly put his hands on the table, and leaned forward, resting his head on his arms. Without seeing his face, he already knew that he was about to cry. If Jia Duocai saw this and said that he was provoking his new favorite, this would not be a trivial matter.

<h3 id="e156">Common Sense about Household Medicines <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Wu Sheng</p>
<p>We should always have medicines in our homes to prepare for the unexpected because the occurrence of illness is unpredictable. Seeking a doctor for treatment on the spot is often uneconomical. It is even more essential to have them on hand in places with poor transportation. Now, I will list some simple and commonly used medicines below:</p>
<p>External Medicines</p>
<p>1.  Carbolic Acid Solution: This is a poisonous and potent medicine. It is made by mixing 98 grams of lukewarm water with 2 grams of carbolic acid. Use it for disinfecting fingers and instruments (at 30 to 50 times dilution) and for wiping injured areas (at 20 to 30 times dilution).</p>
<p>2.  Lysol (Liquor Cresoli Saponatus): Dissolve in lukewarm water at 30 times dilution. Use the same way as above.</p>
<p>3.  Alcohol: Mix two parts alcohol with one part clean water. It has the same effect as above.</p>
<p>4.  Tincture of Iodine: Use for disinfection, reducing swelling, inflammation, and contusions.</p>
<p>5.  Boric Acid Solution: Use for gargling, washing eyes, and cleaning wounds.</p>
<p>6.  Glycerin (Glycerinum): Prevents dry lips. When mixed with five to ten times its volume of water, it can be used for enemas.</p>
<p>7.  Zinc Sulfate Solution: Use for eye drops.</p>
<p>8.  Olive Oil (Oleum Olivae): Use for rubbing on injuries.</p>
<p>9.  Ammonia Water: Use for rubbing on insect bites. It is also effective for reviving someone who has fainted or has heatstroke. Smell it for the purpose.</p>
<p>10. Zinc Oxide: Apply to abraded skin or moist, ulcerated areas.</p>
<p>11. Menthol Solution: Has a miraculous effect when rubbed on for headaches, toothaches, and neuralgia.</p>
<p>Internal Medicines</p>
<p>(1) Sodium Bicarbonate: Treats chest tightness and motion sickness.</p>
<p>(2) Bismuth Subnitrate: Can regulate the stomach and intestines after a bowel movement.</p>
<p>(3) Bitter Tincture, Quinine Tincture: Medicines for stimulating appetite and strengthening the stomach.</p>
<p>(4) Aspirin: Treats colds, wind-heat, pain relief, and rheumatism, etc.</p>
<p>(5) Sodium Bromide or Potassium Bromide: Treats sedation, neurasthenia, palpitations, restlessness, insomnia, convulsions, and other ailments.</p>
<p>(6) Castor Oil: Treats food poisoning and suspected infantile dysentery.</p>
<p>(7) Sodium Chloride (Natriumoratum): Treats hemoptysis and induces vomiting.</p>
<p>(8) Macnin: Deworming medicine.</p>
<p>(9) Migraeninum: Treats headaches, reduces fever, and relieves symptoms of intoxication from smoking and alcohol.</p>
<p>(10) Senega: Used for cough relief.</p>
<p>Medical Instruments</p>
<p>(1) Eye wash cup</p>
<p>(2) Inhaler</p>
<p>(3) Gauze</p>
<p>(4) Medicated cotton</p>
<p>(5) Thermometer</p>
<p>(6) Disinfecting basin</p>
<p>(7) Enema syringe</p>
<p>(8) Measuring cup</p>
<p>(9) Scale</p>
<p>(10) Syringe (Intravenous injections should be performed by a doctor)</p>
<p>Age and Dosage</p>
<p>Generally, for infants under one year old, give 1/15 to 1/10 of the adult dose each time, and 20 milliliters per day. For children aged one to two years, give 1/8 of the adult dose each time, and 30 milliliters per day. For children aged two to three years, give 1/6 of the adult dose. For children aged three to four years, give 1/4 of the adult dose, and about 35 milliliters per day. For children aged five to seven years, give 1/3 of the adult dose, and approximately 40 milliliters per day. For children aged seven to fourteen years, give 2/3 of the adult dose each time. For children aged fourteen to twenty years, give 2/3 to 3/4 of the adult dose. For adults aged twenty to sixty years, give the full adult dose. For adults over sixty years, give 2/3 to 3/4 of the adult dose.</p>
<p>Precautions for Taking Medicine</p>
<p>Medicines prescribed by the hospital will invariably have instructions such as "30 minutes before meals" or "5 minutes after meals" written on the bottle or package. These instructions are not strictly defined. Generally, acidic medicines are best taken before meals, while medicines that irritate the stomach are best taken after meals. When the stomach is empty, medicine is easily absorbed, but for medicine that is strongly absorbed, it is best to take it after meals. Also, do not take medicine with tea. For example, the iron in medicines containing iron will be dissolved by the tea. When giving medicine to children, adding some sugar does not affect the efficacy. Other precautions: (1) Taking antipyretic medicine often harms the stomach and causes side effects, so it is not suitable to take it on an empty stomach and should be taken when the fever has subsided. (2) Taking laxatives is generally necessary due to poor gastrointestinal function and impaired secretions, so they should be taken on an empty stomach or before going to bed. (3) Taking emetics should be done with boiling water for a faster effect.</p>

<h3 id="e157">National Games Martial Arts Rules Established and Announced (2) <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>Boxing and Weaponry Events Changed to Demonstration Matches</p>
<p>Other Events Still Decide Winners Through Competition</p>
<p>Total of Fifteen Events for Men and Eleven for Women</p>
<p>Articles Revised, Methods Changed</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Wrestling</p>
<p>Article 18: Competition to Determine Win or Loss in Wrestling Matches: Weight, Middleweight, and Lightweight—three weight classes. Each match consists of three rounds. Winning one round earns two points. If a round ends in a draw, each wrestler earns one point. The wrestler with the most points after three rounds wins. If the scores are tied after three rounds, a fourth round will be held to determine the winner, and so on.</p>
<p>Each round is limited to five minutes. However, if one wrestler is taken down, the round ends even if five minutes have not elapsed. After each round, there is a one-minute rest period before continuing to the next round.</p>
<p>If both wrestlers fall simultaneously, the round is considered a draw, but it counts as a completed round.</p>
<p>If a wrestler lacks competitive spirit and attempts to stall, the referee may issue a warning. If the wrestler does not change their approach after the warning, they may be declared the loser, awarding two points to the opponent.</p>
<p>A wrestler is considered to have lost if one hand or one knee touches the ground due to being thrown. If a wrestler attempts to throw their opponent but first touches the ground with a hand or knee, and it is clear that they were not thrown by their opponent, they should not be mistakenly considered to have lost. However, if the wrestler fails to throw the opponent and achieve their goal, they lose one point. If there is a foul during wrestling, it is considered a loss.</p>
<p>Article 19: Ranking</p>
<p>Wrestling matches in the men's division, weight, middleweight, and lightweight, all use an elimination system. However, to determine the top six places, the principles in Section 16 of the competition regulations will be followed. To make it easier to understand, the method of selecting the top six from the semi-finalists is explained below.</p>
<p>The winner of the final is undoubtedly the first place. The four losers in the semi-finals will compete against those from the same half of the draw (i.e., "A" vs. "D", "E" vs. "G"). If "D" and "E" win, then "A" and "G" are eliminated. The two winners then compete again, and the loser is the sixth place ("D"). At this point, the winner ("E") should compete against the loser from the other half (i.e., the upper half), ("B"), to determine fifth place. If "B" loses, then "B" is fifth and "E" is fourth (because "E" was already defeated by "F" from the lower half, so it can be determined as fourth). After this, only "F" and "C" need to compete in the final match, the winner is second and the loser is third. If "B" wins against "E", then "E" is fifth, and "B" will compete against "F". The loser is fourth. If "B" wins again, then "C" is second and "B" is third because they have already met in the original order and do not need to compete again. If in the "B" vs. "F" match, "F" wins, then "B" is fourth, and "F" competes with "C", the winner is second and the loser is third.</p>
<p>Article 20: Fouls</p>
<p>The following actions during wrestling are considered fouls:</p>
<p>(1) Striking the opponent with boxing techniques.</p>
<p>(2) Attacking the opponent's mouth, eyes, throat, etc., with fingers.</p>
<p>(3) Any action that could harm the opponent.</p>
<p>Article 21: Wrestling Regulations</p>
<p>(1) No undershirts may be worn under the wrestling uniform.</p>
<p>(2) Thick-soled boots or shoes may not be worn, and metal objects may not be attached to the boot soles.</p>
<p>(3) No objects that could harm the opponent may be used.</p>
<p>(4) The mat used for wrestling will be provided by the organizers and may not be brought by the wrestlers.</p>
<p>(5) The wrestling belt and boot laces must be tied securely before the match to prevent them from coming loose and hindering the match.</p>
<p>Chapter Five: Archery</p>
<p>Article 22: Competition Method</p>
<p>In archery competitions, both target archery and distance archery require each person to shoot three arrows consecutively. The top ten performers in each event will advance to the finals, where they will each shoot three arrows.</p>
<p>Article 23: Target for Target Archery</p>
<p>The target for target archery is circular, with a diameter of 66 centimeters. It is divided into three rings: an outer blue ring, a middle white ring, each 11 centimeters wide, and an inner red ring with a diameter of 22 centimeters. Each centimeter is divided into a grid, for a total of 66 grids.</p>
<p>The center of the target is 1.5 meters above the ground.</p>
<p>Article 24: Distance for Target Archery</p>
<p>The distance for target archery competitions is set at 30 meters.</p>
<p>Target Form</p>
<p>Article 25: Ranking</p>
<p>The winners of the target archery competition will be determined by the total score of the three arrows. The scoring method is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Hitting the inner ring (red) scores five points.</p>
<p>(2) Hitting the middle ring (white) scores three points.</p>
<p>(3) Hitting the outer ring (blue) scores one point.</p>
<p>If two or more competitors have the same score, the winner will be determined by the total number of grids hit by each competitor. The grid count is calculated from the outside to the inside. The final rankings are determined by the better score of the finals and preliminary rounds. That is, if the score and grid count in the finals are not as good as in the preliminary rounds, the score and grid count from the preliminary rounds will be used.</p>
<p>The rankings for distance archery will be determined by the best shot of the six arrows in the finals and preliminary rounds. If two or more competitors have the same result, they will each shoot one arrow again to determine the ranking, but each person's official result will still be recorded as the original result.</p>
<p>Article 26: Bow Strength</p>
<p>The bow strength is specified as follows:</p>
<p>(1) For target archery, the bow strength for men is from two to four *li* (unit of force), and for women, it is from one to three *li*.</p>
<p>(2) For distance archery, the bow strength is from three *li* to five *li*. Those who bring their own bows and arrows may use them, but they must be inspected and approved.</p>
<p>Article 27: Archery Errors</p>
<p>Archery errors are defined as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Flipping the bow or losing the string.</p>
<p>(2) The arrow falling to the ground.</p>
<p>(3) Releasing the arrow accidentally.</p>
<p>Anyone who commits two errors will be disqualified from the competition.</p>
<p>Article 28: Archery Competition Regulations</p>
<p>(1) Archers must start and stop according to the referee's commands. Archers must not shoot before the referee has given the starting command, nor shoot after the referee has given the stopping command.</p>
<p>(2) The archer's front toes must be within the designated boundary line.</p>
<p>(3) In target archery, after three arrows have been shot, they must wait for the referee to determine the score and grid count before retrieving the arrows.</p>
<p>(4) After the arrows shot by the previous person have been removed from the target, the next person may begin the competition.</p>
<p>(5) There must be no practice shots during the competition.</p>
<p>(6) Before the competition, archers should check their bows and arrows and adjust their clothing to avoid hindering their movements.</p>
<p>(7) Once an arrow has left the string, regardless of distance or whether it hits the target, it is considered shot and cannot be retrieved and shot again.</p>
<p>(8) After shooting, the bows and arrows should be handed over to the administrator and not discarded at will. Those who bring their own should take them away themselves.</p>
<p>Chapter Six: Pellet Shooting</p>
<p>Article 29: Competition Method</p>
<p>In pellet shooting competitions, each person fires three pellets. The top ten performers will advance to the finals, where they will each fire three pellets.</p>
<p>Article 30: Pellet Target</p>
<p>The target is circular, with a diameter of 40 centimeters, divided into inner and outer rings. The outer ring is blue and 10 centimeters wide, and the inner ring is red with a diameter of 20 centimeters. It is made of metal and has bells suspended behind it so that when a pellet hits it, it makes a sound, allowing the scoring of the impact location.</p>
<p>Article 31: Shooting Distance</p>
<p>The distance for pellet shooting is set at 20 meters. (To be continued)</p>
<p>(Qingdao, 14th) The summer training lecture and discussion conference organized by the National Sports Association will be held at 10:00 AM on the 15th in the Shandong University Auditorium. The chairman of the association, Wang Zhengting, arrived from Ping at 7:30 AM on the 14th to participate. The association will host a banquet at 7:00 PM on the 15th to entertain officials from various agencies and sports figures to foster camaraderie.</p>
<p>Shanghai Chinese Football Team Loses in Saigon Competition; South Star Club Cables Inviting South China Team to Avenge Defeat, Also Inviting Li Huitang to Accompany, Li Too Busy to Go</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Shanghai Chinese football team recently went to Hong Kong to march south, first going to Saigon in French Indochina to challenge. At that time, Cao Guicheng and He Jiaqiang were unable to catch the boat and could not accompany the main team to Saigon, only being able to rush to Singapore to wait for the team to arrive there and rejoin. Unexpectedly, on the morning of the 11th, the leader of the South China team's southern tour, Mr. He Runguang, suddenly received a cable from the South Star Sports Club in Saigon, saying that the Shanghai Chinese team had suffered a crushing defeat in Saigon, requesting an immediate rematch, and also inviting Li Huitang to accompany them. According to He, this team's backfield strength is sufficient and stronger than the Shanghai Chinese team, and the difference between goalkeepers Huang Jiliang and Xu Heng is also like heaven and earth. After arriving in Saigon, they will not repeat the Shanghai team's mistake. However, Li Huitang is busy with official duties and may not be able to go. Li Huitang also said that he has not received accurate information about the Shanghai Chinese team's performance in Vietnam. He is also unaware of South Star's invitation for him to join the South China team's southern tour. However, due to his work obligations, he cannot leave Hong Kong and cannot join any southern tour team.</p>
<p>Singaporean Chinese Swimming Achievements Advance Rapidly; Two National Records Broken; Preparing to Participate in the National Games</p>
<p>(Singapore) The 6th National Games is scheduled to be held in Shanghai on National Day, October 10th, this year. Various provincial units have long been sharpening their swords and actively training, ready to go. Many prominent Singaporean Chinese swimmers have retired, but emerging young heroes are springing up like mushrooms after rain. The current champions are still under twenty years old, with a long future ahead and unlimited potential. It is heard that the Singaporean Chinese swimming team, with the National Games approaching, plans to select elite members to represent Singapore in the National Games, as well as to prepare for the World Games next year. On July 1st, a Singaporean area swimming competition was held. In the men's 200-meter breaststroke, Lu Jisheng broke Guo Zhenheng's national record of 2 minutes 5.2 seconds with a time of 2 minutes 4.9 seconds. In the men's 400-meter freestyle, Yang Yumu also broke Shi Xingzhi's record of 5 minutes 51.9 seconds with a time of 5 minutes 44.4 seconds. If the Singaporean Chinese team can participate in the National Games, and if aquatic heroes Chen Weishui (Guangzhou champion), Xiao Shancai (water polo captain), Chen Hongcheng, and Yang Yumu, etc., can go together, there is great hope of winning the water sports championship at the National Games.</p>

<h3 id="e166">Historical and Geographical Evidence Confirms that Chinese Science Was Invented Early <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Unfortunately, Later Generations Followed Old Ways and Made Mistakes</p>
<p>Letting Europe and America Make Rapid Progress</p>
<p>The National Compilation and Translation Bureau recently submitted a response to the Ministry of Education, stating that it had received a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, along with a letter from the American Ohio Black-Co Auto Company to our embassy in the United States, requesting materials on aviation knowledge. The original documents were attached, requesting review and reply. After investigation, the matters requested by the original letter from the ministry concerned historical and geographical knowledge of aviation countries, such as the location of the Great Wall of China and the place of invention of kites and gunpowder. The bureau was ordered to investigate and reply on the above matters for forwarding. Upon investigation, the Great Wall of our country actually began in the Warring States period (3rd century BC). At that time, the northern borders of countries such as Qi, Zhao, Zhongshan, and Wei all built Great Walls to protect themselves. When Qin destroyed the six kingdoms, in the 33rd year of Emperor Qin Shi Huang (214 BC), the walls were connected and expanded, starting from Lintao in the west and ending at Pinghuan in the east, known as the Ten Thousand Mile Wall. After successive dynasties added repairs, the location has changed greatly. What remains today are the ruins of the Nine Border Towns of the Ming Dynasty, starting from the Yalu River in the east and ending at the Jiayu Pass in the west, divided into Liaodong, Jizhou, Xuanfu, Datong, Taiyuan, Yansui, Ningxia, Guyuan, and Gansu Nine Garrisons. Among the nine border towns, except for the Liaodong Garrison from Shanhaiguan to the Yalu River, which is outside the pass, and the Taiyuan and Guyuan Garrisons, which are inner borders and not counted, the current Great Wall should be based on the outer border from Shanhaiguan to Jiayu Pass. Its location starts from Shanhaiguan in present-day Hebei Province in the east, travels west along the northern border of Hebei Province, passes through Shimenzhai, Yanheying, Xifengkou, Malanyu, Jiangjunguan, Qiangziling, turns north, passes through Heiyuguan, then travels west again, passes through Gubeikou, Baimaguan, turns southwest, to Juyongguan, then from the east of Juyongguan, Suining, Sihaibao, travels northwest along the Heihe River, enters the border of Chahar Province, passes through Dushi, Daximen, travels south through Maying, Longmenguan, Changyukou, Qingbiankou, Wanquan, Zhangjiakou, Huanghuaping, crosses the Dongyang River and enters Shanxi Province, passes through Niantongbao, Deshengkou, and Killing Tiger Pass to Pianguan, travels along the Yellow River through Qingshuiying, Gushanbao, Shenmubao, Yulinbao, crosses the Wuding River southwest through Hengshan, Jingbianying northwest through Dingbianying into Suiyuan Province, to Yanchi, turns north, passes through Taole, crosses the Yellow River into Ningxia Province, passes through Pingluo to Zhenbeiguan, then travels south along the eastern foothills of the Alxa Mountains into Gansu Province, passes through Gulang, Jincheng, Wuwei, Minqin, Yongchang, Shandan, and Zhangye, and reaches Jiayu Pass, about 2,700 kilometers long. As for the flying kite, according to the "Mozi Lu Wen" chapter, "Gongshuzi cut bamboo and wood to make a magpie that flew and did not fall for three days" (around the 3rd century BC). Also, the "Book of Han Wang Mang Biography" states, "Some said they could fly a thousand miles a day and spy on the Xiongnu. Mang tried it, taking large bird feathers as two wings, with the head and body attached, the hair connected to guide the ring button, and could fly hundreds of steps" (around 20 AD). During the second year of Liang Jianwendi's Dabao (551 AD), Hou Jingyuan made paper kites to fly in the air to report an emergency to the outside, which was the beginning of Chinese paper kites. As for when Chinese gunpowder began and who made it, history does not record it in detail. Some say it was invented by Ma Jun of the Wei Dynasty during the Three Kingdoms period, but it was only made into firecrackers and rockets. During the Sui and Tang dynasties, gunpowder was mostly used for fireworks, as one of the miscellaneous opera skills. It was not until the Song Dynasty that gunpowder was used to make cannons as weapons. During the third year of Emperor Zhenzong Xianping of the Northern Song Dynasty (1000 AD), Tang Fu presented rockets, fireballs, and caltrops, and their use became more widespread. During the Kangding period of Emperor Renzong (1000-1041 AD), Zeng Gongliang and others were ordered to compile the "Wujing Zongyao", which contained detailed descriptions of gunpowder manufacturing methods using saltpeter, sulfur, arsenic, charcoal powder, and other materials. From this, it can be known that the invention of gunpowder must have been before the Northern Song Dynasty. During the 31st year of Emperor Gaozong Shaoxing of the Southern Song Dynasty (1162 AD), Yu Yunwen used gunpowder to make thunderbolt cannons in the Battle of Caishi. The method was to make them with paper, fill them with lime and yellow and throw them into the water, and the fire would jump out of the water, crack, and the lime would scatter as smoke to confuse the enemy's horses, greatly defeating the Jin army. This was the beginning of China's use of fire to build cannons. The West used gunpowder in war around the sixth year of Emperor Shun of the Yuan Dynasty (around 1340 AD), which was more than 200 years later than China. This is a rough outline of the location of the Great Wall and the invention of kites and gunpowder. As per the previous order, this document is respectfully submitted for review.</p>

<p>In order to train wireless radio technicians from education departments and bureaus in various provinces and cities, so that they can return to their provinces and cities after completing their studies to guide middle schools and public education centers in their provinces and cities in the installation, repair, and reception methods of wireless radios, the Ministry of Education has specially organized a wireless radio training class for radio instructors, and has appointed Sun Guofeng, a specialist from the Ministry of Education, as the director of the training class, Xu Yiqiao, the section chief of the Social Affairs Department, as the director of the teaching and training group of the class, and Guo Lianfeng, the section chief of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Department, as the director of the general affairs group of the class (the director of the class is followed by two groups: teaching and training, and general affairs) in order to engage in preparations. The class recruits students, with each province and city education department and bureau recommending one to three people. The qualifications are limited to personnel serving in education administrative agencies, who have graduated from high school or above and have knowledge of physics. The training period is from July 20th to mid-August, a total of one month. The training location is set at the Municipal First Middle School on Fuxi Street, Nanjing. In the past two days, personnel recommended by various provinces and cities have brought official documents to contact the Ministry of Education to register.</p>

<p>According to a Central News Agency report a few days ago, Cai Yuanpei and Ding Wenjiang, directors of the Sino-American Boxer Indemnity Fund, were extremely indignant because the fund had been slow to decide on the allocation of funds for the implementation of national free education for 24 degrees, and had submitted their resignations. It is now reported that Ding stated that he intends to devote himself to writing and research work as much as possible, so he has resigned from his positions as director of the Sino-American Boxer Indemnity Fund and director of the Xiehe Medical School. As for Cai Jiemin's resignation, according to what I know, it is because of his advanced age and inability to cope with the heavy workload.</p>

<h3 id="e170">New Initiatives at Guanghua University in the Next Semester <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>Guanghua University in this city held its 10th anniversary celebration in June of this year. Large buildings such as the auditorium, gymnasium, and the affiliated middle school's science museum were all completed at that time. The internal arrangements have also been gradually completed. Recently, Principal Zhang of the school, in view of the lack of a systematic curriculum in chemistry, has reorganized the entire curriculum of each department with Zhu Gongjin, Qian Ziquan, Rong Qizhao, Yang Yinpu, Liao Maoru, and others, making the content more substantial. Yang Yinpu served as a full-time professor in the School of Commerce of Guanghua University when it was founded, and later served as the Dean of Academic Affairs of the School of Commerce of the National Central University and acted as the Dean for a period of time. This time, Xie Linfu, Dean of the School of Commerce of Guanghua University, left Shanghai for Sichuan, so Principal Zhang requested Yang Jun to help and plan for the next semester, which is a familiar task. The original professors, such as Lu Chengyuan, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Wang Wufeng, Geng Danru, Huang Yingrong, Wu Zelin, Xu Renqian, Tang Qingzeng, Xiao Da, Shen Liren, Wu Chunwu, and Wang Zhongchang, are all well-known professors in the country. Among the new professors who have been decided to be hired for the next semester are Wen Yuanyu, a former professor at Tsinghua University, who will teach literary criticism; Chen Linrui, a doctor of literature from Harvard University, who will teach English literature; a doctor of political economy from the University of Berlin, Germany, who will teach Western history; Yang Rumei, a former dean of the School of Commerce of Jinan University and an accounting expert, who will teach advanced accounting; Cheng Shaode, director of academic affairs of Shanghai Business School and an economic research specialist at the Central Bank, who will teach money and banking; and Zhang Naiqi, deputy manager of Zhejiang Industrial Bank and an economic expert, who will teach Chinese financial issues. All of the above professors are the best of their time. In addition, the school's alumni association has donated a sanatorium to the alma mater, which will be started soon. Guanghua University will have a new look from the next semester.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Overview of Medical and Health Undertakings in Taixing County <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Cheng Xinliang</p>
<p>Although Taixing is a small riverside town, located in a remote area north of the Yangtze River, it still has a population of 800,000 and 1.2 million mu of land. It is only because of the inconvenient inland transportation that few outsiders know about its contents.</p>
<p>Most of the people in Taixing are engaged in agriculture. Rice and cotton are produced along the river. Sorghum and soybeans are abundant in the eastern part of the city. Rice and cotton are only enough for the county's people to eat and wear. Soybeans are mostly pressed into oil for food, and the bean cakes are used to feed pigs and fertilize the fields. Sorghum is brewed into wine. Both wine and pigs are the county's major export goods.</p>
<p>The level of traditional culture here is quite high. During the late Qing Dynasty, thirty-six scholars were selected. People are fond of studying to become officials, and superstition is also unavoidable. However, now influenced by the new culture, everything has a renewed atmosphere.</p>
<p>There are currently three junior middle schools and more than 70 primary schools in the county. Therefore, many students have to leave the county to study after graduating from primary school. Now, Taixing students account for 2% of the number of students in middle schools across the country. There are also quite a few studying abroad.</p>
<p>As for transportation, Shanghai and Nanjing can be reached in just 12 hours. Inland highways are now actively planned and constructed. The Qipu Road (provincial road), the Koutai Road (county road), and the Tonghuangtai Road have been completed and are open to automobiles. Steamships operate on the inland rivers throughout the county, and rickshaws operate inside and outside the city. Transportation is considered convenient.</p>
<p>Now, let's talk about hygiene. Let's just talk about the city and its suburbs.</p>
<p>Modern medicine has only been around for the past 20 years, and hygiene has only been around for the past two years. There are more than 300 traditional doctors in the city. Only about a dozen are the most famous. Traditional doctors used to have a great deal of influence. Although it is now a dying ember, it is still a spent force. There are also more than a dozen modern doctors, all of whom graduated from Nantong. They have formed a doctors' association, which is very influential. Therefore, deputy doctors have gone to the countryside to practice. Most modern doctors practice privately. The most famous are Yanling Hospital, Jieshou Hospital, and Aisheng Hospital. Their businesses are doing quite well. There are more than 40 traditional medicine shops. The largest are Renyuansheng and Qingchunyü. They slaughter deer every year. There are Yanling Pharmacy, Sino-Foreign Pharmacy, and Anglo-American Pharmacy for new medicines. They all make proprietary medicines, hire pharmacists, and fill prescriptions, making a good profit. Other new medicines, such as Rendan, are sold in major foreign goods stores.</p>
<p>The building of the county hospital has been completed. It has not been successful because of funding and the people's lack of sufficient initiative. It has now been converted into a county opium detoxification center.</p>
<p>The funding for the county opium detoxification center is all allocated by the province, and the staff is also appointed by the province. It can accommodate 100 opium addicts. It is well managed, but it does not have a good relationship with the people. This is not surprising. These things are difficult to please people.</p>
<p>The county's health administration is still handled by the Public Security Bureau. Sanitation campaigns are held twice a year as usual. Health slogans are posted, amusement fairs are held, and health dramas such as mosquitoes and flies are performed. During the general cleaning, the county magistrate leads by example, holding a broom, and is quite serious. At this year's summer sanitation campaign, 100 copper coins were used to buy five schools of flies. There are also many health slogans posted on the streets.</p>
<p>There is a county vaccination bureau that provides free smallpox vaccinations for the people. There are also clinics that provide vaccinations as a side business, as well as medical relief bureaus, which are run by the Red Swastika Society, providing free diagnosis and medicine. In the summer, they distribute antidotes for heatstroke and dysentery medicine.</p>
<p>Modern doctors' consultation fees are 10 to 20 cents for outpatient visits and 1 to 10 yuan for house calls. Western medicine starts at 25 cents a dose. Traditional Chinese medicine doctors' consultation fees range from 100 to 500 wen for outpatient visits and 30 cents to 2 yuan for house calls. They all accept envelopes and do not have fixed consultation rates. Chinese medicine is at least 10 cents a dose. The people's belief in both sides is still balanced, so modern and traditional doctors are still at peace with each other on the surface, and there are no conflicts.</p>
<p>However, preventive medicine is too poor. Health education is even more out of the question. Spitting everywhere and urinating all over the alley. Who knows the importance of hygiene? Everyone knows to ask the Bodhisattva to bless them and ask the doctor for a prescription when they get sick. Where do they know the importance of health care when they are not sick? In addition to physiology and hygiene, schools do not fully understand the true meaning of hygiene.</p>
<p>Now, Dr. Zhou Xueyu is publishing a popular medical lecture in Taixing Minbao to enlighten the people, which is very gratifying.</p>
<p>The above is a general overview of medical and health affairs in Taixing. If there are any errors or omissions, I hope people in this county will point them out.</p>
<h3 id="e173">Recent Observations on Tuberculosis (Part 2) <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Ding Huikang</p>
<p>—Changes in Theory and Combined Therapy—</p>
<p>There are two routes for tubercle bacilli to invade the bronchial lymph nodes: (1) through the bloodstream to the lungs, causing primary aggregation; (2) the second is the lymph nodes, namely through a number of separate gland groups to reach the bronchial lymph nodes. During the age of development, the bronchial glands are most likely to store tubercle bacilli for a long time, so tubercle bacilli also mostly take this as their base camp.</p>
<p>The formation of inflammatory tuberculosis can be roughly divided into three categories:</p>
<p>(1) Tubercular Bacterial Inflammation (Lieberweister) bacillaere</p>
<p>(2) Tuberculous Toxic Inflammation (Poncet) toxisch</p>
<p>(3) Tuberculous Allergic Inflammation (Schwly) allergisch</p>
<p>Lieberweister's observation believes that chronic inflammatory tuberculosis is a mild form of tuberculosis infection, the cause of which is due to a small amount of tubercle bacilli, which cannot become a formal change in the tissue, so there is no formation of tuberculosis, such as adenopathy. In these symptoms, Lieberweister used hypochlorite, and tubercle bacilli could be detected in the blood.</p>
<p>Tuberculous toxic inflammation, French physician Poncet has published the formation of tuberculous Rheumatimus in 1897, believing that it is due to the toxin of tubercle bacilli entering the synovial fluid of the joint, causing an inflammatory state. Other conditions such as bronchitis, gastritis, and vulvitis can also occur as a result.</p>
<p>Tuberculous allergic inflammation is greatly related to the collapse of protein and decomposition poisoning.</p>
<p>If there is a bronchial lymph node, there is often invasion and absorption of tubercle bacilli. The glandular tissue collapses and causes inflammation, exudation, gangrene, or caseous degeneration. If tubercle bacilli and their toxins and various debris flow from the inside of the gland to the lymph vessels or bloodstream at the same time, and at the same time the body, or after external stimulation, becomes abnormally weak, then various defenses can collapse, and the phenomenon of disease occurs, which is the so-called tuberculous allergic inflammation.</p>
<p>However, the establishment of tuberculous allergic inflammation must have two causes:</p>
<p>(1) There must already be a tuberculous lesion in the body</p>
<p>(2) Protein decomposition and collapse</p>
<p>The phenomenon of tuberculous toxic inflammation mostly belongs to chronic. Tuberculous allergic inflammation, on the other hand, is mostly acute and special. Schwly believes that iritis, rhinitis, and laryngitis are all allergic.</p>
<p>Inflammatory tuberculosis, after encountering immunity in various aspects, can become a patient with stage 3 lung disease. (That is, it becomes a hidden tuberculosis patient, which is completely different from the meaning of stage 3 tuberculosis as it has always been called.)</p>
<p>For special drugs for tuberculosis, there is only Tuberculin (according to Koch's invention of tubercle bacilli, Tuberculin was extremely popular in tuberculosis treatment, but since the effect was not obvious, it was gradually abandoned all over the world. In recent years, it has been applied again because it can increase our antitoxin to tuberculosis.) However, great care must be taken when applying it. If there is no active lung lesion and no initial infiltration after examination by X-ray, it can be applied. For patients with tuberculous allergic inflammation, it must be applied after the toxic allergy has subsided, that is, using a denaturation method, no longer allowing it to have toxic phenomena, and reaching a normal state. Denaturation treatments, such as physical and nutritional treatments, are all. In particular, changing the environment is an important issue of denaturation treatment. As for drugs, such as calcium, arsenic, iron, etc., and especially metal salts are the most important. When they are applied in large quantities, the purpose of rapid denaturation can be achieved. (Note: Pure vitamin D does not seem to have any effect on tuberculosis, and excessive abuse is extremely harmful to the human body. Some infants have died from abuse. Some people think that vitamins should be used simultaneously in four types, or vitamin A and D, preferably with calcium and phosphorus agents at the same time, then the effect is great and the toxicity can be reduced, but the arguments are mixed and inconclusive. Only its toxicity has been completely and definitively proven, and it is still necessary to take cod liver oil and fresh fruit.)</p>
<p>The combined therapy of Tuberculin and metal salts is probably the most appropriate treatment method for inflammatory tuberculosis today. (Due to space limitations, the implementation of specialized surgery will be described in another article in the future.) —Sent from the Lung Disease Research Institute of the University of Hamburg, Germany.</p>
<h3 id="e174">The Dog with Pancreas Removed <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Yue Qi</p>
<p>—Medical Story Four—</p>
<p>Around 1890 AD, a famous doctor in Strasbourg named Naunyn was one day casually walking on a bridge in his hospital. He looked down at the courtyard below and saw many dogs, divided into two groups, separated by a fence. They were experimental subjects for a physiology professor studying the application of digestive functions. He had removed the pancreas from several dogs to observe any physiological changes. To avoid confusion, he divided the dogs into two groups: one group with the pancreas removed, and the other with the pancreas intact. The weather was warm and pleasant. Doctor Naunyn, in the mindset of both a scientist and a poet, leaned on the railing and looked down. Suddenly, he discovered a miracle: swarms of flies were densely concentrated on the urine of the group of dogs with their pancreases removed, while the urine of the other group of dogs did not have this. "The taste of these two types of urine must be different," he thought. He went down to the courtyard, collected some of the fly-infested dog urine, and took it back for chemical analysis. Indeed, he discovered that it contained sugar. He ran into the physiology professor's laboratory.</p>
<p>"What have you done to those dogs in the yard?" he asked the physiology professor.</p>
<p>"I removed the pancreas from several dogs," the professor replied.</p>
<p>"Then," Doctor Naunyn exclaimed, "the lack of pancreatic juice is the cause of diabetes!"</p>
<p>This is a story recorded in medical history about the discovery of the cause of diabetes. Sweet urine is a prominent symptom of diabetes; precisely because of this, the early medical community mostly regarded diabetes as a kidney disease. In the first decade of the AD era, Aretaeus even stated that diabetes was "the melting down of the flesh and its discharge in the urine." It was not until the aforementioned story occurred that Doctor Naunyn discovered that the cause of diabetes, with its significant symptoms of weight loss and increased urination, was not in the kidneys but in another organ. Of course, this was just the beginning of the discovery. The determination of the cause of diabetes and the success of its treatment would still depend on many subsequent experiments and discoveries.</p>
<p>So, how does diabetes occur? First, let's talk about normal people: starch and sugar in food, through the action of digestive juices, are converted into glucose and enter the liver through the intestines. In the liver, glucose is converted into a carbohydrate—glycogen, or animal starch. Muscle contraction requires energy, and this energy comes almost entirely from glucose. To supply glucose, the liver releases glycogen, which is then converted back into glucose in the liver or muscles. When muscles contract, glucose is burned, i.e., oxidized—it combines with oxygen brought by the blood—thereby producing heat and energy. At the same time, the glucose molecule is converted into water, carbon dioxide, and a small amount of lactic acid. The spark that ignites glucose is "isletin"—the secretion of the "Islets of Langerhans" in the pancreas. When muscles contract, the secretion of isletin from the pancreas and the secretion of glycogen from the liver are both needed simultaneously.</p>
<p>In the nutritional system of diabetics, all of this is the same as in normal people, except for one difference: their Islets of Langerhans are not healthy and cannot secrete isletin, or secrete too little. Therefore, the glucose entering the muscles does not burn and accumulates in the blood. The kidneys are very sensitive to excess glucose in the blood. Therefore, when glucose increases in the blood, the kidneys remove it from the blood, dissolve it with sufficient water, and excrete it in the urine. This explains why diabetes involves urine, why the kidneys are unfairly blamed for causing diabetes, and why diabetics often feel thirsty: all of this can be understood from here.</p>
<p>The current diabetes researcher Wooyatt says that diabetics are like a malfunctioning gasoline engine, which is quite accurate. To start the engine (to make the muscles contract), gasoline must be discharged from the fuel tank (glycogen—glucose—must be discharged from the liver) and mixed with air in the carburetor (glucose mixes with air brought by the blood), but to ignite it, the spark plug must generate a spark (the pancreas must produce isletin). If the spark plug is fouled (if the Islets of Langerhans are not healthy), then combustion is incomplete, and black smoke is emitted from the exhaust pipe (glucose is excreted in the urine).</p>
<p>The progress in diabetes treatment is, of course, due to a clear understanding of the nature of diabetes. Since the invention of isletin preparations, doctors have had complete confidence in treating diabetes.</p>

<p>(60) Muscular Rheumatism</p>
<p>Q: What is muscular rheumatism?</p>
<p>A: It is a disease of acute or chronic muscle soreness.</p>
<p>Q: How does muscular rheumatism occur?</p>
<p>A: Many people develop this disease due to their constitution or heredity. As for external causes, such as cold and damp weather, a certain muscle suddenly becomes ill, such as "stiff neck." Also, strenuous work or trauma can also cause muscular rheumatism, such as "back pain" and "traumatic myalgia."</p>
<p>Q: Is muscular rheumatism related to a person's occupation?</p>
<p>A: Yes, it is very related. It is common among farmers, people living in the mountains, and washerwomen.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of this disease?</p>
<p>A: The symptoms of muscular rheumatism can be acute or chronic.</p>
<p>Q: What are the acute symptoms?</p>
<p>A: The acute symptoms are sudden pulling pain or tearing pain in one muscle or the muscle groups nearby. This pain is very severe and is felt even at rest; it is extremely severe during activity, making it impossible to move. Pressing hard on the middle part of the muscle is not so painful. It is more painful when exposed to cold and relieved by warmth.</p>
<p>Q: In acute muscular rheumatism, what are the abnormalities in the muscle itself?</p>
<p>A: The affected muscle is slightly swollen, and there is pain at the attachment points of the muscle, muscle sheath, and tendon. Sometimes there is spasmodic contraction. The affected part is often curved, like the lateral curvature of the waist.</p>
<p>Q: Which parts of the body are most prone to acute muscular rheumatism?</p>
<p>A: It is most prone to occur in the shoulders, head and neck, waist, chest, and head.</p>
<p>Q: Are there any other symptoms besides muscle symptoms in acute muscular rheumatism?</p>
<p>A: There may be fever, but not very high; there may also be nasal congestion, but there are no heart changes.</p>
<p>Q: How long does this disease usually last?</p>
<p>A: It can be cured in a few days, but it is easy to recur.</p>
<p>Q: What are the symptoms of chronic muscular rheumatism?</p>
<p>A: Pain migrates imperceptibly from one muscle to another, or occurs in a certain muscle group. The affected muscles have hard, contracted nodules.</p>
<p>Q: How can muscular rheumatism be diagnosed?</p>
<p>A: Because the main symptom of this disease is subjective pain in the muscles, it is easily concealed by malingerers. Attention must be paid. Objective diagnosis is very difficult.</p>
<p>Q: How should muscular rheumatism be treated?</p>
<p>A: For acute cases, drug therapy can be used, such as internal administration of salicylate preparations, atropine, and antipyrine. Apply warm compresses locally with a hot water bottle and take a steam bath to induce sweating. Apply camphor alcohol and mustard alcohol to the skin.</p>
<p>Q: What about chronic cases?</p>
<p>A: For chronic cases, local massage and hot spring therapy can be used. Steam baths are also quite effective.</p>

<p>— Tang Renjin</p>
<p>(55) Ozena</p>
<p>Ozena, also known as atrophic rhinitis, is a type of atrophic rhinitis. It is considered a special disease in nasal diseases. The nasal mucosa and turbinate bone of patients with this disease are particularly atrophic, losing their physiological state. Therefore, the nasal cavity is abnormally enlarged. Secretions easily crust and produce a severe and unpleasant odor. As for its causes, there are many theories, and no one knows for sure. There are theories of paranasal sinus empyema, bacteria, nutritional imbalance, heredity, congenital syphilis, and inferior turbinate hypertrophy. According to recent reports from doctors and my personal clinical experience, the bacterial theory seems closer to the truth. Because the pathogenic bacteria of this disease have been confirmed and "vaccines" can be made to treat it. Its effect is sometimes very certain. This disease is most common in adolescents. It is less common in young children and the elderly. It is also more common in women than in men, especially when it occurs during puberty. Another thing to note is that the nutrition of patients with this disease is generally poor. They usually appear anemic.</p>
<p>The onset of this disease is mostly insidious. Patients often do not know that they have this disease. It is only a slightly increased nasal discharge from the nasal cavity. After several years (i.e., until puberty), a foul odor begins to emit from the nasal cavity. The three major symptoms of this disease also occur sequentially. The so-called three major symptoms are (1) the severe odor of secretions, (2) the formation of crusts, and (3) the atrophy of the nasal mucosa. Now, they are described separately as follows.</p>
<p>(1) The severe odor of secretions: This symptom is the most important feature of this disease. It is called ozena because of this severe odor. Its odor is completely different from the odor of other nasal diseases (such as paranasal sinus diseases). That kind of odor is truly nauseating for three days. It is like the foul odor of a crushed stink bug or the odor of something rotting. In short, it is a disgusting, hateful, and nauseating odor. When the odor is severe, it can be smelled if you are in the same room with the patient. Therefore, patients usually do not want to set foot in social circles to avoid the humiliation of being shunned by others. However, patients themselves often do not feel the odor in their nose. This is because the olfactory nerves in the nasal cavity have lost their sense of smell after a long illness. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e177">Medical Treatment for Pain (23) <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Large burns are extremely painful, and doctors must relieve the pain for the injured. When the pain is extreme, injecting morphine is the most effective way to relieve it. However, it is important to note that too much morphine should not be injected. In addition to relieving pain, morphine also causes nausea and vomiting. It must be known that burn victims must drink large amounts of fluids. If the nausea and vomiting caused by morphine prevent the victim from swallowing or cause them to vomit after swallowing, the body will not get enough water, and their life will be in danger. Therefore, it is best to inject a small amount of morphine to give the injured person some comfort and allow them to endure some pain. This is a safer approach. In addition to injecting morphine, proper treatment can also relieve most of the pain. For burns of a few inches in size, picric acid solution can be applied externally. This medicine has local analgesic, antiseptic, and protein precipitation effects and can form a temporary skin on the wound. This medicine should not be used for burns covering a large part of the body because excessive use of this medicine is toxic. For large wounds, tannic acid solution should be sprayed. The protein in the damaged area can coagulate to form a temporary skin. Nerve receptors are less stimulated, and pain can be reduced by 80% to 90%. To avoid later pain, prevent the wound from ulcerating, because if it ulcerates, the pain will be prolonged. To avoid ulceration and inflammation, wash the wound with antiseptic solution after the injury, cut away the rotten flesh, and then apply the medicine as described above.</p>
<p>The second major problem is avoiding life-threatening danger. With proper treatment, the dying can be brought back to life; with improper treatment, those who should not die will die. There are several major causes of life-threatening danger after severe burns. Knowing these causes and using rational treatments can reduce many of the dangers. The first major danger after burns is the large amount of serum that flows out of the wound, reducing the amount of water in the body's blood, leading to increased blood concentration. Increased blood concentration can cause blood flow to stagnate, which can lead to the victim's death. The remedies are: (1) Use the above burn treatment methods to form a temporary skin on the wound to prevent the loss of serum from the body. (2) Increase the body's water content. Supplement the water lost from the body to prevent increased blood concentration and help excrete toxins from the body. Methods to increase water content: (1) Increase fluid intake. The injured should drink more water, fruit juice, and any fluids. For severely injured people, they should drink 10 to 15 pounds of fluids in 24 hours, because severely injured bodies roughly need this much fluid. If a large amount of fluid cannot be obtained orally, intravenous injection of dextrose solution, or intramuscular injection of physiological saline solution, or rectal drip, or a combination of the above methods should be used.</p>
<p>The second urgent task is to reduce blood poisoning. Blood poisoning is caused by the absorption of decomposed skin and muscle proteins from the burned area into the blood. Increased toxins in the blood are enough to cause the victim's death. The first way to reduce blood poisoning is to prevent toxins from the wound from being absorbed into the blood. The above two medicines work to precipitate and destroy the decomposed toxic proteins. Once the toxic proteins are precipitated, they cannot enter the blood, thus reducing the danger. The second is to help the toxins in the blood be excreted quickly. To help with excretion, the body's fluid circulation must first be increased, and the amount of urine must be increased so that a large amount of toxins is excreted through the kidneys. The healthy skin should be kept warm, and less sweating is also good. Secondly, clearing the bowels also has considerable benefits.</p>
<p>The third urgent task is to resuscitate unconsciousness. The method is to inject a small amount of morphine to relieve pain and inject cardiac stimulants to save exhaustion. Keep the victim's body warm. The last important thing is to adopt scientific medical sterilization and disinfection treatment methods to avoid wound ulceration and inflammation. Note that without sterilization and disinfection treatment methods, ulceration and inflammation are very easy to occur, and ultimately may cause the victim's death.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Acute Mastitis <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>Women often develop acute mastitis during breastfeeding. This is also a very painful condition. Women who have raised children experience this kind of suffering very often. In larger hospitals, patients seeking treatment for this condition can be seen every day. The causes, prevention, pain relief, and treatment of this disease are briefly described below for the reader's reference.</p>
<p>Once acute mastitis occurs, the affected area will be painful. If treated properly at the onset of inflammation, the situation can be turned from danger to safety. If not treated properly, the affected area will ulcerate after acute inflammation and become chronic mastitis. The cause of acute mastitis is often that women who are not healthy and are anemic have cracked nipples or sores on their nipples, allowing bacteria to invade deep into the breast and cause acute inflammation. Pay attention to breast injury is also a very important cause. During lactation, the breasts are often heavy and sagging. If the breasts are full and you run quickly, the breasts can be injured. Even a slight collision can cause this problem. The structure of the breast is mostly fatty tissue mixed with milk cells and some connective tissue. The ability of this type of tissue to resist bacteria is very weak, so large abscesses are prone to occur, and it is also slow to heal after ulceration.</p>
<p>When acute mastitis starts, the inflamed area swells and is also intensely painful. The body also feels feverish and chills. Due to unbearable pain, breastfeeding is difficult, or the swelling obstructs the milk ducts, inflammation and pain are compounded by milk distension, which is adding fuel to the fire, and the patient cannot sleep or eat well. After several days of such pain, it will mostly suppurate. If treated properly at the beginning, there is a good chance that the swelling will gradually subside and the condition will be completely cured. If left to nature without seeking medical treatment, the affected area will sometimes ulcerate and the wound will not close easily.</p>
<p>The highest goal of treatment is to relieve pain and reduce inflammation and swelling at the same time. To achieve this goal, the pathology must be understood and rational treatment methods must be used. To relieve pain and reduce swelling at the onset of inflammation, the first urgent task is to rest the breast. Rest is also the first secret to reducing inflammation and relieving pain. It is appropriate for inflammation in any part of the body. It must be known that the position of the breast is sagging and it swings with the movement of the body at all times. If the breast is allowed to swing naturally, it will certainly not be able to rest. To make the inflamed breast rest, a very simple method is to lift the breast or wrap it with bandages so that the breast does not swing with the movement of the body. The arm on the same side as the inflamed breast should also be wrapped so that it cannot move, because when the arm moves, the muscles at the bottom of the breast will also move. If these muscles do not move, the breast can rest completely. It would certainly be even better to also rest in bed, following the above method. In addition to rest, heat, such as hot wet compresses, three times a day, is also very effective in relieving pain and reducing swelling. Applying this kind of heat to the inflamed part can dilate the blood vessels, thereby reducing the tension of inflammation, and the pain can also be reduced by more than half. By increasing blood flow, toxins can also be excreted more, and swelling also has a chance to subside sooner. Another thing that greatly helps reduce swelling and relieve pain is to periodically extract milk from the inflamed breast. The method is to use a breast pump several times a day to extract the milk so that there is no accumulation of milk in the breast. This also has a small effect on pain relief. In addition to the above methods, applying belladonna ointment to the affected area also has some benefits in reducing inflammation and relieving pain. As for the Chinese people, when an abscess occurs in the breast, they only know to apply plasters and hope to reduce inflammation and swelling. It is undoubtedly certain that such a method will not achieve satisfactory results.</p>
<p>Even if the above methods are implemented, abscess formation is sometimes unavoidable. When there are signs of pus in the inflammation, surgery should be performed to release the pus. After the pus is completely drained, it can gradually heal completely. Anesthetics or general anesthesia can be used during surgery to avoid pain. If you are afraid of pain and do not have surgery, the abscess will often ulcerate on its own after many days. It will not be easy to treat after ulceration, and at least you will have to suffer for several more months, and the body will also suffer great damage.</p>
<p>To avoid the pain of mastitis, women who breastfeed should prevent mastitis. The methods of prevention can be summarized as follows: (1) Women who breastfeed must pay attention not to injure the breast. Injuries to the breast, such as bites, bumps, hits, and rapid running, should be avoided. (2) Small sores or cracks on the breast should be treated with antiseptic methods as soon as possible to avoid causing mastitis. (3) If the breast is slightly swollen and painful, it should be treated according to the above methods.</p>

<p>Part Two: Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Chapter Three: Transmission of Gonorrhea</p>
<p>Gonorrhea is an infectious disease. The necessary condition for its infection is the presence of the causative agent, namely gonococcus.</p>
<p>Gonococcus infection is mostly due to sexual intercourse between men and women. Indirect transmission through fingers, bathhouses, cloths, and other utensils is only seen in young girls whose development is not yet complete.</p>
<p>As for the mechanism of transmission, in men, the urethra opening widens as a result of penile erection, allowing gonococci to be transmitted along with the gonorrheal secretions. Moreover, after ejaculation during intercourse, the erected penis suddenly shrinks, thus having a pump-like effect, making it easier for gonococci to be drawn into the urethra along with the secretions.</p>
<p>The degree of gonococcus infection varies depending on various circumstances. Abnormal urethras, such as epispadias and hypospadias, are more susceptible than normal ones. Urination and genital washing immediately after intercourse can reduce the chance of infection. In addition, there is a relationship to individual characteristics and environment.</p>
<p>In women with chronic gonorrhea, there are very few gonococci in their secretions at ordinary times, and the infectivity is not very obvious. However, excessive intercourse and menstruation cause congestion of the reproductive organs, causing a rapid increase in gonococci. Therefore, it often happens that the same partner is only infected after several times. This is the reason.</p>
<p>Gonococcus infection initially occurs in the most anterior part of the urethra, so it is easily affected by the action of germicides. The next day, it gradually spreads to the entire urethral mucosa and deeper into the underlying tissues. At this time, the administration of germicides is less effective. Therefore, as soon as one contracts gonorrhea, one should seek treatment from a doctor. Otherwise, a spark can start a prairie fire and cannot be contained.</p>
<p>Chapter Four: Brief Overview of the Anatomy of Male and Female Urogenital Organs Related to Gonorrhea</p>
<p>To make it easier for readers to understand the course and symptoms of gonorrhea, the anatomy of the urogenital organs is briefly described as follows.</p>
<p>One, Male Urethra</p>
<p>A, External Urethral Meatus (Orifficium externum) There is an accessory urethra.</p>
<p>B, Navicular Fossa (Fossa naviculari) is quite wide. Its concavity is boat-shaped.</p>
<p>C, Corpus Spongiosum (Pars cavernosa) is the spongy tissue surrounding the urethra.</p>
<p>D, Bulbar Portion (Par bulosa) is the rearmost part of the corpus spongiosum of the urethra. There are numerous mucosal recesses called Morgangniscbe Lacune. In addition, there are openings of glands equally distributed in the urethral mucosa (Littresche Druesen and Cowpersche Drueesn).</p>
<p>E, Membranous Portion (Pars membranacea) is the narrowest part of the urethra. Its periphery has strong striated muscle fibers arranged in a circular ring, called the external sphincter (Musoulns sphincter externus).</p>
<p>F, Prostatic Portion (Pars Prostatica) is the widest part of the urethra. It contains the colliculus seminalis (Colliculus seminalia), prostatic sinus (Sinusptostaticus), ejaculatory duct (Ductus ejaculatoicus), and prostatic ducts (Ductus prostaticus). The posterior part of the prostate connects to the bladder, surrounded by smooth muscle, called the internal sphincter.</p>

<h3 id="e181">Last Year's Rice, Wheat, and Flour Transactions <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Tang</p>
<p>At this time last year, the drought was worsening, and people were fearful, thinking that by this time next year, rice prices would be unimaginably high.  However, although rice prices are indeed high this year, they are not as extreme as feared last year. What is the reason for this? It is impossible to seek answers everywhere, so we turn to a portion of the figures in the Customs Report to get a glimpse.</p>
<p>According to the investigation, the imported foreign rice last year was 7,710,610 quintals, while the previous year it was 12,954,001 quintals, a decrease of 5,243,391 quintals. In terms of value, this represents a decrease of 56%. Wheat imports were 4,649,419 quintals, while the previous year they were 10,714,634 quintals, also a decrease of 6,065,215 quintals, with a value decrease of 64%. Flour imports were 595,748 quintals, while the previous year they were 1,957,113 quintals, a decrease of 1,361,365 quintals, with a value decrease of 74%. The reasons for this decrease are: (1) It should be recognized that before June of last year, rice-producing provinces were still sending urgent telegrams to discuss measures to alleviate the problem of low grain prices harming farmers, indicating that the food supply seemed to be excessive rather than insufficient. (2) Although there was a drought last year, its impact should be felt this year, as the food supply for that year, like the previous two years, was abundant, so there should not have been any shortage. (3) Although there was a drought last year, the harvest in the north was still good, and even in the south, such as Wenzhou and Haicheng in Zhejiang, as well as various places in Fujian and Guangdong, there were reports of good harvests. The harvest from the polder fields in the Dongting Lake area was also quite good. Jiangsu, except for a very few counties that were severely affected, also had an autumn harvest. The province that was most severely affected was Zhejiang, with 72 out of 75 counties experiencing disaster, followed by southern Anhui. (4) The prices of agricultural products have been falling for years. Farmers' economies are extremely depleted, and they often cannot even afford to eat. Sweet potatoes are now the best food for farmers, and the situation of those who eat worse is unimaginable. Therefore, how could the sales of rice, wheat, and flour not decrease? (5) Since the import tariffs on rice, wheat, and flour were increased on December 16th of the previous year, this also had a minor effect on the decrease in imports. However, its effect was still small, as it is clear that foreign rice would still be imported regardless of how low grain prices in our country are.</p>
<p>Looking further at the content of last year's imported rice, wheat, and flour, almost all of the rice came from Siam and Annam. Of the 7,710,000 quintals of imported rice, 3,450,000 quintals were Siamese rice and 3,342,000 quintals were Annamese rice. The rest came from Japan and Korea, with the 640,000 quintals imported from Burma being the largest. A total of 4,649,000 quintals of wheat were imported. American wheat accounted for 3,086,000 quintals. Of this number, excluding 181,000 quintals that were ordered by merchants, the rest were imported through cotton and wheat loans. In addition, the wheat harvest in the Jianghuai area was abundant, resulting in a significant decrease in the import of Australian and Argentinian wheat. Argentinian wheat imports were 1,344,000 quintals in the previous year, but only 970,000 quintals last year. The decrease in Australian wheat was even greater, from 8,395,000 quintals in the previous year to only 430,000 quintals last year. Most of the flour also came from the United States, with 355,000 quintals, some of which were also from loans. Canadian flour accounted for 109,000 quintals, Australian flour for 119,000 quintals, and Japanese flour for 9,800 quintals. The total amount of rice exported overseas was 68,289 quintals, of which 46,000 quintals were transported to the Kwantung Leased Territory and 14,000 quintals to Hong Kong. In addition, Japan, the United States, and the United Kingdom each received one or two thousand quintals. The amount of wheat transported abroad was 132,664 quintals, with 122,977 quintals transported to Japan. Of the 64,572 quintals of flour transported overseas, over 50,000 quintals were transported to the Kwantung Leased Territory, with the rest going to the Philippines and Hong Kong. A table is provided below (all units in the tables are quintals, the old Customs tael, one hundred catties, equals 0.605 quintals).</p>
<p>Table of Rice, Wheat, and Flour Imports and Exports in the Republic of China, 23rd Year</p>
<p>The above is only an outline, and it does not clearly show where these large quantities of imported food were sold. Furthermore, it does not show what the situation of domestic grain circulation is. Although the Customs Report lists some national grain production figures, it is impossible to estimate what percentage they represent. However, the amounts transported by ship are generally included, which is more reliable than simply making conjectures. Therefore, they have been classified, reorganized, and compiled again to obtain the following three tables for rice, wheat, and flour. With these three tables, we can get a better impression of the food supply and demand in each region, and it is not difficult to determine whether there is a surplus or a shortage. Looking at the tables, it is clear that the amount of domestic rice falls far short of meeting domestic needs. As for wheat, the abundant harvest in Jiangbei last year is indeed a fact. It is important to know that most of the wheat from Jiangbei and northern Anhui is transported by cart, but the amount exported from Zhenjiang and Nanjing alone was 543,000 quintals, and from Wuhu, it was 152,000 quintals, so the scale of its exports can be seen. However, this is still far from meeting domestic needs. As for flour, domestic mills have a large influence, and foreign flour is insignificant. In Shanghai, the export of flour from domestic mills last year was already 5,627,000 quintals, while the import to the Hebei region was 3,029,000 quintals. It can be said that the imported foreign flour last year was sold in Shanghai and Guangdong, and very little elsewhere. Since the machine-made flour industry closed down, they have suddenly become prominent, if they can be well managed, why should there still be imports of foreign flour! The three tables are listed below:</p>
<p>1. Rice</p>
<p>2. Wheat</p>
<p>3. Flour</p>
<p>This article cannot discuss much, as it is not permitted by the nature of this publication. However, it must be stated that the "last year" mentioned in the article refers to the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and the "previous year" refers to the 22nd year of the Republic of China. Furthermore, when using Customs figures as research material, changes in transportation methods, such as the increasing development of railways and highways, mean that more and more goods are not passing through Customs. Therefore, how to ensure that researchers have relatively sufficient and reliable figures is what we hope from those responsible.</p>
<h3 id="e182">World Gold Production and Gold Reserves <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Fangren</p>
<p>Before 1931, the gold standard was widely implemented in various countries and was almost the sole representative of gold for monetary use. Today, under the premise of stabilizing currencies, the idea of restoring the gold standard is once again welcomed by economists. The definitive answer to this question is, of course, not simple; however, understanding the basis for rebuilding the gold standard depends on the extent of efforts to establish new parities for various currencies. If the gold content of the gold pound, gold dollar, and franc was 60% or 50% of what it was before 1931, then the monetary price of a fixed amount of gold would inevitably increase proportionally; also, if the central bank's gold reserve ratio is reduced from 40% to 25%, the price of the gold reserve amount will increase even further. There are several points that are unclear here, that is, how much gold will be held in the future, or how much will actually be held as a gold reserve within a certain limit, no one dares to predict, as this will vary depending on the intentions of each country.</p>
<p>The Gold Bloc and the Sterling Bloc</p>
<p>We must first examine the actual amount of gold used for monetary purposes and its distribution. The fifth annual report of the Bank for International Settlements can provide us with some information on this point. The report divides the world's currency situation into two camps: the Gold Bloc and the Sterling Bloc. The former, in addition to France, the Netherlands, Italy, Poland, and Switzerland, also includes Albania, Belgium, Bulgaria, Cuba, Czechoslovakia, Danzig, Germany, Greece, Yugoslavia, Latvia, Lithuania, Mexico, Romania, Spain, Turkey, the United States of America, and Uruguay. The latter includes Argentina, Australia, Bolivia, Brazil, Colombia, Denmark, Egypt, Estonia, Finland, the United Kingdom, India , the Irish Free State, Japan, Norway, New Zealand, Paraguay, Portugal, Siam , the Straits Settlements,Sweden, the South African Federation, and British colonies. Originally, the countries of the Gold Bloc did not necessarily completely lock down their currencies, and there was a very significant distinction between them and the countries of the Sterling Bloc. This classification is only for ease of description.</p>
<p>The Supply of Gold</p>
<p>Next, let's examine the issue of gold supply. Since 1929, both the gold pound and the gold dollar have been stimulated by falling prices. At the same time, with the increase in gold production in Canada and Soviet Russia, the world gold production has increased sharply as shown in the table below (unit: thousands of ounces):</p>
<p>Year Main Force South Africa Pound US Canada Soviet Russia Other Countries Total</p>
<p>1920 10,422 2,208 1,928 1,085 3,952 19,585</p>
<p>1929 10,716 2,286 2,102 1,434 4,184 20,722</p>
<p>1931 10,878 2,396 2,694 1,701 4,701 22,370</p>
<p>1932 11,559 2,449 3,044 1,990 5,185 24,227</p>
<p>1933 11,014 2,537 2,944 2,816 6,062 25,378</p>
<p>1934 10,480 2,916 2,964 4,224 6,532 27,107</p>
<p>Most of the increase in production in "Other Countries" in the table above can be attributed to Australia. In terms of price, the value of gold production in 1934 was 2,904 million Swiss francs. In addition, "hoarded gold" from countries in the Far East also flowed out at the same time. The estimated amount is shown in the following table (unit: million Swiss francs):</p>
<p>Year India China Hong Kong Total</p>
<p>1931 477 54 63 594</p>
<p>1932 1,014 28 59 1,191</p>
<p>1933 633 74 100 827</p>
<p>1934 1,003 54 68 825</p>
<p>Total 2,847 300 290 3,437</p>
<p>The outflow of gold gradually decreased after 1931; however, the outflow of gold in the past four years far exceeded the total amount of gold produced worldwide in the entire year. The Bank for International Settlements included the amount of gold recovered from industrial use in the United States, Italy, and the United Kingdom in its calculations; thus, it could only assume that all of the newly produced gold and the outflow of gold from privately held hoards in the countries of the Far East was sufficient to serve as gold reserves and all of Europe's "new private hoards."</p>
<p>The Demand for Gold Used in Currency</p>
<p>The annual report also mentioned the demand for gold used in currency. In 1934, the amount of newly produced gold was approximately 2,904 million Swiss francs, and the outflow of gold from hoards in countries of the Far East was 875 million Swiss francs (this amount differs from the previous table by 50 million Swiss francs, which was not explained in the annual report). The amount available for currency reserves was approximately 3,779 million Swiss francs or more. In contrast, the "publicly announced" gold reserves of 50 countries was 4,834 million Swiss francs, exceeding the supply by more than 55 million Swiss francs. Part of this difference is due to various exchange rate balances that were not "publicly announced," especially part of the Anglo-American exchange rate fund in 1934, which was erased.</p>
<p>The Distribution of Gold</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of gold distribution, the holdings of major countries are shown in the following table: (unit: million Swiss francs)</p>
<p>Country End of December 1933 End of December 1934 End of March 1935 Change in 1934 Change in the First Quarter of 1935</p>

<p>Japan 1,098 1,205 1,219 (+)107 (-)14</p>
<p>In 1934, France's gold holdings increased, mainly due to inflows from Gold Bloc countries. In the first quarter of this year, France's holdings also increased slightly, while those of the entire bloc decreased again. However, the Bank of France's gold reserves have decreased by 1.1 billion Swiss francs since the end of March of this year, while the United States has seen a significant increase. France and the United States now hold approximately two-thirds of the world's publicly announced monetary gold.</p>
<p>The Meaning of Public Announcement</p>
<p>The restriction of "announcing it publicly" is necessary at present. There are two reasons for this. First, the exact amount of the exchange rate balance funds of the United Kingdom, the United States, and other countries is unknown to outsiders. The annual report only mentions that the British and American exchange rate balance funds made huge purchases in 1933. The previous year's report stated that the amount received from private hoards was approximately 3.12 billion Swiss francs, while this year's report states that the amount obtained from the exchange rate balance fund was roughly the same as the 3 billion Swiss francs from private hoards. However, in 1934, the amount of the United Kingdom's balance fund gradually decreased. Part of this was due to the increase in funds flowing out of London, and part of the outflow of funds from the United Kingdom was used to pay for international loans to the Sterling Bloc.</p>
<p>The second reason for using the term "public announcement" is the existence of private hoards. These private hoards are not only sufficient to cause panic, but also create extreme difficulties in the global distribution of gold, making it impossible to calculate. Large companies that have to use gold dollars and gold pounds to do business are worried about the sharp fall in exchange rates and hold gold. Therefore, gold is still the most authoritative factor in determining exchange rate fluctuations today. Although some of the privately hoarded gold is analyzed and actually used as funds for international trade, this is an exception and is not often seen in the usual situation.</p>
<p>The Amount of Privately Hoarded Gold</p>
<p>The Bank for International Settlements annual report estimated the amount of privately hoarded gold at the end of 1934. The total amount of newly produced gold and gold flowing out of Far Eastern countries from 1930 to the end of 1934 was over 15 billion Swiss francs. During this period, the world's gold reserves increased by approximately 10 billion Swiss francs. After studying the withdrawal of gold coins, the consumption of gold for industrial use, the purchase of exchange rate balance funds, and the private hoards before 1931, the amount of private hoards at the end of 1934 can be estimated at 7 billion Swiss francs, of which 1.8 billion Swiss francs belonged to the Bank of England's gold reserves, while the rest is unknown. Most of it probably belongs to the exchange rate balance fund, or has been recorded in the accounts of foreign central banks. Approximately half of these privately hoarded gold holdings, excluding the privately hoarded amounts in India, China, and Egypt, are kept in London. In the United States, this large amount of privately hoarded gold is withdrawn and used as gold reserves. If the currency stabilizes and the market is stable, then a portion of the private hoards can flow out and become the reserves of the central bank. Therefore, this point can be determined by itself, and this fact means that it is possible to avoid the panic of a future shortage of gold for monetary use.</p>
<p>The Redistribution of Gold</p>
<p>Furthermore, regarding the redistribution of gold, the United Kingdom and the United States still hold the vast majority of the world's monetary gold. First, privately hoarded gold will flow into the weaker central banks, because most of the privately hoarded gold flowed out from there in the first place. Whether those weaker central banks can continue to keep it is another question. This depends entirely on currency stability and the method of rebuilding the gold standard. If the currencies of various countries reach equilibrium at the same time, then international commerce, investment, and finance will return to ease, and countries will naturally need that private gold to maintain gold reserves. If this condition is met, then the hoarded gold in various places can still flow to financial centers, and for another part of the gold, it will lose considerable activity. Sooner or later, the newest type of gold standard will be abandoned.</p>

<p>Regarding the gold delivery orders for July, yesterday 28 orders were settled at a profit by the short side at the Fengheng Exchange. The long side will take in, today, with Qianchangxiang, Lichang, Dadecheng, and Huixiang each taking in 7 orders, settled at a price of 844 yuan. There is a net remainder of 546 orders this month, with a total of 15 long parties and 2 short parties.</p>
<p>Auxiliary Coin Market Appears Slightly Weak</p>
<p>Yesterday's silver market saw little change in various prices as it was Sunday and banks were closed for holidays. The foreign exchange discount rate remained the same as before, with both morning and afternoon markets at 2 jiao. For discount ticket trading, over 2.3 million was transferred in the morning market, with over 200,000 in new transactions. There was no activity in the afternoon market. In the small general association, over 800,000 was traded. Money shops settled over 3.2 million in foreign exchange public orders, and there was over 300,000 in remittances. For banknote trading, only over 200,000 in secretly marked notes were issued, with 200,000 from customer sources and no activity in withdrawals. The settlement of bank orders was temporarily suspended due to the closure. As for the auxiliary coin situation, it already showed slight weakness. Jiangnan small silver dollars rose by 2 yuan in the morning market to 833 yuan, but fell back by 3 yuan in the afternoon market to 830 yuan. As a result, the final price was only 1 yuan lower than the previous market. The trading volume was 2,000 jiao in the morning market and none in the afternoon market. Guangdong small silver dollars remained at 734.5 yuan in the morning market, but fell by 0.5 yuan in the afternoon market to 734 yuan. As a result, the final price also fell by 0.5 jiao compared to the previous market. The trading volume was 140,000 jiao in the morning market and 60,000 jiao in the afternoon market. Copper coins were at 341,500 wen, unchanged from the previous market, with a trading volume of 30,735 strings of cash, equivalent to 9,000 foreign dollars.</p>

<p>Last week (July 8th to 13th), the volatility of securities on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange remained rampant. Initially, under the dual constraints of the current situation and tight money, it struggled to rise, further causing physical goods to flood the market and a significant decline in prices. The June 23rd contracts even fell below the 60 yuan mark, and the June 22nd contracts also fell below the 50 yuan mark. The discounts on various bonds had fallen to 50-60%, even 70% of their face value. Since the prosperity or decline of the bond market is of great importance, how could one cause such self-inflicted harm? Therefore, efforts were made to support the market and promote favorable propaganda for the long positions. Moreover, the rumor of actual delivery posed a great threat to the short positions, shaking their lines and causing a sudden rebound. The price declines finally came to an end. The 96 Public Bonds maintained their original state at the beginning of last week. In the last two days of the week, however, large investors suddenly purchased them eagerly, and the market price soared. It once broke through the 10 yuan mark. Although it slightly declined afterwards due to some selling pressure, it soon recovered and flourished. It is rumored that the bond is being manipulated by powerful forces, as they have been absorbing it relentlessly since last month's settlement. Their strong financial backing is evident. Other bonds fell by 3-5 jiao to 1.2 yuan each, except for the recent June 20th and June 23rd contracts, which rose by 1-2 jiao. The 96 bonds rose by 0.5 to 0.8 yuan. The total transaction volume for the entire week was 16,897,000 yuan. The following is a table comparing the high and low results of the week. (The Securities Exchange will temporarily suspend the afternoon session starting today due to the hot weather.) Unit: yuan; Transaction Unit: 100 yuan.</p>

<p>—The Market is Calm and Gradually Declining</p>
<p>Yesterday, when the American cotton market opened, the market situation was calm. Prices for each month fell by one to four points. Then, due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and good weather, prices continued to fall. Afterwards, the liquidation of long positions by retail investors and selling from the South were offset by limit orders from peers, purchases from spot traders, and local purchases due to the strong stock market. However, peers remained cautious pending the final vote in the Senate. Near the close, broker's long positions, affected by the weakness in the wheat market, began to sell, causing prices to weaken. Spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 10 to 13 points. British cotton spot prices fell by one point, and futures prices fell by one or two points. Indian cotton trading was sparse in the morning, but prices strengthened later due to purchases by futures traders. Pinggu'er fell by 0.5 rupees, Aomula rose by 0.25 rupees, and Bairoxi rose by half a rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 13th).</p>

<h3 id="e186">Sugar Market Domestic Refined and Red Sugar Rise Up in Struggle <a href="#e186" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c186" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">186</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was generally weak. The guild's initial price for spot No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar was 15.95 yuan, which later fell by 0.05 yuan to 15.90 yuan. Transactions for goods from this company at 16.05 yuan were also made, totaling less than a hundred bags. Taikoo Sugar B fell another 0.1 yuan to 17.3 yuan, with few transactions. No. 1 refined white sugar from this factory was 15.3 yuan, unchanged. In the number board, Guang merchants offered over one hundred seventy bags of Hainan red sugar at a price of 10.05 yuan, a slight increase.</p>
<p>Shou Zi No. 1 sugar from the Siming Factory is 20 yuan per package for refrigerator businesses and 19.8 yuan per package. It is currently selling well to retail stores in Luotang. Yesterday, 330 pieces were sold. Yuanrun sheet ice is 16.6 yuan (price uncertain), Shuangfu ice is 20 yuan, and Shuangxi ice is 21.8 yuan. All are being purchased on this street.</p>
<p>Domestic refined red sugar sales have been extremely active this past week, and transactions between brokers and companies have also increased. A total of 1,300 to 1,400 bags have been opened, with the highest price being 11.6 yuan, followed by 11.23 yuan to 11 yuan, and the common price being 10.09 yuan to 10.07 yuan. In terms of quality, it is above Dutch red sugar, but the current price is lower, which is very consistent with the principles of competition. Therefore, sales have suddenly become brisk, which is good news for domestic sugar.</p>

<h3 id="e187">Cha'an Short Stories <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>—Some Textual Researches on Novels</p>
<p>In late May, a Hangzhou bookseller came to Shanghai to sell a large number of old books. Da Jie and I were particularly fond of "Cha'an Short Stories." I was already so poor that I couldn't afford to live, so I didn't dare to think about this rare book at all. Da Jie was also struggling financially, and he flipped through the book several times, shaking his head and sighing, feeling unable to buy it. A few days later, I met Da Jie again, and he happily told me that he had finally bought the book because the bookseller had agreed to a payment plan. And I, therefore, had the opportunity to read it and write this short essay about it.</p>
<p>"Cha'an Short Stories" is very rare, consisting of 41 volumes, written by Lai Sixing. It is a classified collection of textual researches, which can also be said to be notes. It was published in the Xinwei year of Chongzhen. In his preface, Bozi said that the book began in the Gui Si year of Wanli and was completed in Xinwei, taking nearly forty years, and was revised five times before completion. Its content "ranges from astronomy, geography, national affairs, anecdotes, military affairs, and criminal law, to crowns, attire, surnames, given names, funeral rites, music, interpretations of plants, trees, birds, animals, and foreign tribes." There are about a thousand items in total.</p>
<p>Some of them are a waste of effort, such as the "Horse" section, which compiles all the names of horses owned by famous people since the Yellow Emperor, and the "Dog" section, which lists countless dog names from ancient times. A lot of time was spent, but it is meaningless. However, most of it is a good source of information and contains a lot of valuable material. My recent interest has been focused on novels. Here, I just want to say a few words about the sections related to characters in novels.</p>
<p>The most important part of the novel research is the "Zhang Shun" entry. This has a great relationship with "Water Margin." The text is: "In Water Margin, there is Zhang Shun, nicknamed 'White Streak in the Waves,' who is good at swimming and is considered a naval commander. Guixin Miscellany: During the siege of Xiangyang and Fancheng, the isolated city was besieged for three or four years. Zhang Hanmo defended Fancheng and offered a large reward to recruit brave warriors, obtaining 3,000 fierce men. After searching for a general for a long time, he obtained Zhang Shun and Zhang Gui, officials of the Ministry of War, known as the Great General Zhang and Little General Zhang, whose wisdom and courage were always admired by the armies. First, they established a strong camp at Zhongshuiyu in the upper reaches of Junzhou, built water哨, and used a hundred light boats, each with thirty men. Each boat was given a bag of salt and two hundred bolts of cloth, and they were ordered: 'This journey is only about death. If it is not your true desire, leave quickly, and do not ruin my affairs.' Everyone was grateful and angry, riding the wind and waves, and directly attacked the enemy's 重园, and the rebel soldiers were all defeated. The people in Xiangcheng heard that help had arrived, and their courage was a hundred times greater. When the army was collected, Zhang Shun was lost. After several days, a floating corpse floated upstream, wearing armor and holding a bow and arrow, directly reaching the floating bridge. Upon inspection, it was Zhang Shun. He had four spear wounds and six arrows in his body, and his anger was as vivid as life. The army was surprised and thought he was a god, and built a temple to worship him. Zhang Gui was later captured and died unyielding. Lü Wenhuan built a double temple for them. According to Bi Xunyuan, Zhang Shun was indeed good at swimming, but he was not a person from the Xuanhe period. Now, in Wulin, inside Yongjin Gate, there is a temple to General Jinhua, Cao Guo, a person from the Later Tang Dynasty, who was the magistrate of Jinhua. After pacifying the rebels, Wu Yue entrusted him with national affairs, and he dredged three pools in the city corner, drawing lake water into the city. Wang Gui praised him and titled it 'Yongjin.' When Gao died, the people of the county worshiped him, calling him General Jinhua, mistaking him for Zhang Shun. Water Margin says that Song Jiang went to Li Shishi's house, and the Daoist Emperor arrived, hiding under the bed. This is Zhou Chengmei's affair, as seen in Zhang Duanyi's Precious Ear Collection." This shows the origins of Zhang Shun's brothers in Water Margin, and the basis for the fact that Song Jiang went to Li Shishi's house. The composition of the Water Margin characters is actually taken from the Three Dynasties.</p>
<p>The second is "Han Xiang," namely Han Xiangzi in the Eight Immortals. The author quotes from the Collected Works of Changli, Qing Suo High Talks, Gleanings from Immortal Biographies, and Youyang Miscellany, to recount Han Xiang's anecdotes, which are mostly similar. However, it is said that Xiang is Changli's "distant cousin," and some say he is a "nephew," which is not consistent. Qing Suo High Talks says: "Xiang's name is Qingfu, and he is Duke's nephew. He was dissolute and did not dominate. Duke encouraged him to study, but he smiled and wrote a poem with the line 'Able to open flowers in an instant.' Duke said, 'Can you steal creation to open flowers?' Xiang then piled up soil and covered a pot. After a long time, he said, 'The flowers have bloomed.' He lifted the pot, and there were two green flowers with small gold characters on the leaves, which read 'Clouds cross the Qinling Mountains.' Xiang said: 'Things can be tested over time.' Duke was later demoted to Chaozhou. On the way, a person came through the snow, who was Xiang. Xiang said: 'Do you remember the flower lines?' Duke asked the place name, which was Languan. He sighed again and again, and then composed a poem, without mentioning that Xiang was his nephew or grandson." Gleanings from Immortal Biographies says that he can dye flower colors, and Youyang Miscellany also says the same. Youyang Miscellany describes his dyeing flower process: "He erected a screen at a right angle to cover the peony bushes, preventing people from peeping. He dug holes on all four sides, deep to the roots, wide enough for a person to sit, and only brought purple ore, light powder, and vermilion, and treated the roots every evening for seven months, then filled the holes." This is more reasonable. The Collected Works of Changli only used the poem "Zuo Xun Arrives at Languan to Show Nephew and Grandson Xiang" to mention Han Xiang. The Ming edition of the book "Han Xiangzi" has not been seen, and it is unknown whether it mentioned this matter.</p>
<p>Another "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" short study says: "The story of Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai is popularly told, but its source is unknown. Ningbo Prefectural Records, in the west of the prefectural city, there is a tomb of a virtuous woman, which says that Liang and Zhu were classmates when they were young, and Liang did not know that Zhu was a woman. Later, Liang became the magistrate of Yin, and died and was buried here. Zhu mourned at the bottom of the tomb, the tomb cracked and she died, and they were buried together. Xie An requested that they be titled the Tomb of the Virtuous Woman, so the matter should have been in the Eastern Jin Dynasty. The Yixing County Records has Zhu Yingtai's residence. The Jiaozhou Records of Shandong Province, a hundred miles south of the state, has Zhu Yingtai's tomb. Now, Shangyu also has Liang Shanbo's tomb, or it may be a mistake in transmission." The recorded story is generally familiar to us, and the records of location and time are particularly valuable.</p>
<p>Regarding legends, there is the "Diaochan" section, which quotes Bu's wife's remonstrance from the Annotations to the Records of the Three Kingdoms, suspecting that the so-called "Bu's wife" may be Diaochan. It also quotes the Huai'an Records: "Pizhou has a dressing table, in the ancient Lower Qi city, it is said that Lü Bu dismissed the concubine Diaochan and dressed up here. The ruins still exist." There is no historical evidence, and "Diaochan's name is only seen here, so the words of the legend are not without basis, but whether she was a wife or a concubine is unknown." The "Zhaojun" section is a compilation of references to the Zhaojun affair recorded in the Records of the Former Han Dynasty, the Records of the Later Han Dynasty, the Southern Xiongnu Biography, and the Miscellaneous Records of the Western Capital, with comparative research. The "Four Beauties" textual research is the most detailed:</p>
<p>"The Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue, King of Yue obtained the daughter of a woodcutter from Mount Luoluo, named Xi Shi and Zheng Dan, adorned them with silk and taught them how to walk and move. They practiced in Tucheng and approached the capital of Wu. After three years of learning etiquette, they silently entered Wu. The Records of Lost Things by Prince Zinian: Yue plotted to destroy Wu, and had two beauties, one named Yiguang and the other named Xiuming, to offer to Wu. So Xi Shi was originally named Yiguang, and her surname was Shi. Because she lived in the west, she was named Xi Shi. However, Mencius directly called her Xizi. The National Policy says: Mao Qiang first Shi. Mei Cheng's Seven Beginnings says: If first Shi and Yang Wen are made to wear gorgeous clothes and serve, then Xi Shi is also called first Shi. Because the first and west characters have the same mother, it is a mistake in transmission. Dongpo said: My family's old surname is Xi, which does not seem to be a mistake. Xi Shi's fate after the fall of Wu is unknown. Du Mu's poem, 'Xi Zi goes down to Gusu, a branch follows Chi Yi.' Song Zhiwen: 'One day returning to the old capital, dressed up to search for Ruoye.' Mozi said: Xi Shi's beauty was immersed, and there is no basis for it. The Spring and Autumn Annals of Wu and Yue: Xi Zi was killed after the fall of Wu. Now, outside the city of Shaoxing Prefecture, there is Xi Shi's tomb, which is likely to be true. Mencius's notes, citing the Historical Records, say: Xi Shi is a beauty from Yue. King Goujian of Yue offered her to King Fucha of Wu, who was very happy with her. Every time she went to the market, people who wanted to see her had to pay one Wen in gold. Now, the Historical Records does not have this statement. Guanzi's Small Scale article: Mao Qiang and Xi Shi are the most beautiful people in the world, and even if they are angry, they cannot be considered beautiful. Guanzi lived more than two hundred years before the King of Yue. Could it be that the ancients had this name, and the Yue woman used it, or is Guanzi a forgery? The story of Xi Shi following Chi Yi is discussed in detail in The Returning Guest's Collection of Books, The Mountain Cutting of Art Forests, The Drunken Words of Art Garden, Chen's Proper Pomegranate, and Hu's Learning Mountain, and will not be listed in detail. The 326th volume of the Taiping Guangji records that in July of the eleventh year of Liang Tianjian, Liu Dao of Pei County and his comrade Li Shiyan disrobed two people in Jingkou, one was Xi Shi and the other was Yiguang. It said that Yiguang was the daughter of the King of Yue, who was offered to Wu with Shi. Although the matter is obscene and not worth mentioning, it is enough to show that there were two people, and that Yiguang should not be called Xi Shi. It is said that Zheng Dan is Xi Shi's name. Also, Yue Jue Shu: Goujian became a subject of Wu, and his wife gave birth to a daughter in the pavilion on the road. Later, Wu was defeated, and the pavilion was named Nüyu, and Li was changed to Daughter Village. Lu Guangwei's Records of Wu Land: It is believed that the affair between Fan Li and Xi Shi is a mistake. The Han Dynasty's Records of the Southern Yue: Yuan Zhonggu was sealed as the Marquis of Yu'er Village, and the note that the word yu is sometimes written as 　 or 　 is now called Yuxi, and it is not necessarily about daughters. Xi Shi was actually born in Wu Xiao. Now, Xiaoshan has Luoluo Village. The Later Han Dynasty Book: Kuaiji Yuji is Xiaoshan, and the note that Xi Shi came from here believes that Zhuji is a mistake."</p>
<p>This research is very extensive. I remember that after "January 28th," many people used "Xi Shi" as a theme to write dramas and novels. The Times also published a travelogue of Zhuji, with photos of Xi Shi's relics. According to this record, it is a mistake. There is also a section on "Writing Fees," which is actually a study of "manuscript fees." "The matter of writing fees has existed since the Wei and Jin Dynasties, and flourished in the Tang Dynasty. Zhang Yanguang received a lot of rare treasures for Yao Xiang's stele, and Han Changli's carriages, horses, and music servants moved with thousands. At that time, there was the opinion of digging gold from the tomb. After that, drafting decrees to remove officials, from the advisory officials to the serving officials, all had writing fees. During the reign of Emperor Taizong of the Song Dynasty, writing fee money was established, and several edicts were issued to engrave stones in the Shereen Academy. Every time an official was removed, a document was sent to supervise it. Officials in the academy, down to the clerks and yamen runners, all shared the benefits. Later, those who missed the deadline would send the courtyard's children to the door to urge them to collect it. Those who were simple and sent them were not surprised. In the early years of the dynasty, this was unheard of. In recent times, those who directly drafted edicts have a slight reward, and the Beijing officials do not accept more than two coins. The regular officials in the outer prefectures and counties gradually have fixed quotas, but no one has heard of them praising them. In normal times, begging for articles is even simpler. The inscriptions on monuments and steles have begun to hear of regular thrift, which is very different from the Tang and Song Dynasties." The living conditions of selling manuscripts in ancient times can be seen. After the Ming Dynasty, I don't know if anyone has studied it.</p>
<p>I have extracted several things about novels on the right for novel researchers to choose from. And the contents of "Cha'an Short Stories" can also be seen in general. Such a special work can be said to be extremely extensive. What he said about spending forty years to complete the manuscript is probably the real situation. I am very clear that Da Jie can find a way to punctuate and reprint it. This book is rare, and its academic relevance should not be small.</p>
<h3 id="e188">A-Jin's Family is Sick <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Zhu Jiaoyang</p>
<p>A-Jin's whole family went to the fields to plant rice seedlings, weed, and operate the waterwheel to draw water. A newborn baby was placed steadily on the edge of the field, baked by the scorching sunlight, blown by the wild wind, and the yellow and thin face had no trace of blood.</p>
<p>They had no cattle, no water-drawing machine, so people became cattle and machines; when their strength was not enough, they did it desperately. When they were thirsty, they drank the muddy cold water from the river, and casually bit into rotten peaches bought from the street. They didn't think of going to the pawnshop, or borrowing money from people at high interest rates, and their lives were still stable.</p>
<p>They worked desperately planting rice seedlings, weeding, and drawing water. Their skin was scorched black, and they were sweating stinky all day long. At night, they slept in a musty, damp thatched hut, naked, with two or three people sleeping together on a broken door used as a bed, without a blanket to cover them. Mosquitoes came in droves to bite them. A-Jin's family, who were exhausted from working during the day, fell into a deep sleep, as if they were dead. When dawn came, their lower limbs felt heavy, like feet cast in lead, a sign of illness.</p>
<p>A-Jin woke up, looking at the pale sky, with no sign of rain. He forced himself to call out to his old mother, wife, and children, and the whole family went to the fields to work.</p>
<p>Planting, weeding, drawing water, without any movement.</p>
<p>The sun shone directly on their bodies, and dirt oozed out from their pores, and they became more energetic as they worked, and the symptoms disappeared.</p>
<p>They did this every day, and their bodies were very healthy!</p>
<p>The danger of drought was already in the imagination of A-Jin's family, especially A-Jin himself was very anxious.</p>
<p>But hope came! The sky gradually became overcast, and soon it rained, and even more rain than they needed. They were extremely happy, and the whole family rested comfortably.</p>
<p>The sound of rain was gurgling, and it couldn't stop. A-Jin seemed to be suffering from insomnia at night, and couldn't sleep. He was thinking about tomorrow's work and recreation. He thought until dawn and came to a decision:</p>
<p>Go to town to mess around for a day!</p>
<p>After eating rice porridge, A-Jin took his ten-year-old child, each wearing a raincoat, and撐ed a boat. In the boat were two stone of white rice and two water chestnut harvesting buckets. They braved the rain and paddled straight to town.</p>
<p>A-Jin carried the rice and water chestnut harvesting buckets into the pawnshop, and the two stone of rice and water chestnut harvesting buckets were pawned for more than ten yuan in total. He hurriedly took his child into a small restaurant and enjoyed a hearty meal of wine, meat, and rice.</p>
<p>There was nothing to do in the afternoon, so A-Jin and his child stepped into Lao Jiang's house to play cards for entertainment. His child stood beside him, urging him to go back. In half a day, the money pawned, except for a lunch that seemed like a free meal, the rest of the money was entered into other people's pockets by A-Jin, who was dominated by this poor luck. Fortunately, there was still a roll of copper coins left.</p>
<p>A-Jin blankly led his child out of Lao Jiang's gate, his thoughts spinning like a windmill, with 横字 blocking his head, thinking of trying to win back if he had a chance. He walked all the way to the fruit stall and bought a basket of rotten peaches with this roll of copper coins, preparing to trick his old mother and wife.</p>
<p>The rain was still falling, and A-Jin and his son returned to Lao Jiang's house. Lao Jiang warmly invited them to eat dinner.</p>
<p>Lao Jiang's wife first arranged for A-Jin's child to sleep. Lao Jiang invited three people and A-Jin to continue playing cards among the partners who came in and out. Lao Jiang lent A-Jin his gambling money.</p>
<p>All night long, the winners were excited and didn't mind not sleeping. But the losers couldn't sleep even if they wanted to. People who neither won nor lost were still calm and already felt a little tired. A-Jin was a loser. He smoked a water pipe and sighed, watching the winners go out to drink morning tea and the people who neither won nor lost go home to sleep.</p>
<p>A-Jin returned home and didn't say a word all day, just sighed coldly. His old mother and wife had already understood his problem, and they swallowed their anger and only cared about eating the rotten peaches with the children. Not eating was foolish, and the peaches seemed to have been snatched.</p>
<p>The sky cleared up, and A-Jin's family was indeed sick and unable to go to the fields.</p>
<h3 id="e189">Loneliness <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Juan Shi</p>
<p>I was just about to pick up my pen, preparing to write something on this paper, when suddenly a bat-like gust of wind flew in through the window, blowing the paper up, onto the teacup, the table, the bed, and finally onto the floor. During the paper's drifting, I didn't offer any assistance. If it could speak, it would probably express its resentment with more than a dozen exclamation marks, like our artists do! Now it lies quietly under my wrist, waiting for the black pen tip to smear some unknowable words on its face. Originally devoid of thoughts, I was stirred by the extraordinary experience of this piece of paper, prompting some feelings. It's not about thinking about my years of wandering, nor do I want to curse the irresistible fate that is disbelieved by most people. I am pondering: if by chance the wind hadn't blown into the room, or if it had blown in but the paper hadn't fallen to the ground, then this small square would now be filled with many other words, wouldn't it? This thought is so peculiar that it caused the hand holding the pen to tremble gradually, and finally, two lines of a smile that was not a smile formed on my cheek.</p>
<p>Just a minute or two ago, I was still propping up my chin, staring intently, pondering some literary problems; but now, what meanders into my mind instead is a kind of loneliness and melancholy tinged with nihilism, which makes me want to put down my pen.</p>
<p>No matter how much someone welcomes liveliness, there will always be an opportunity in their life when they feel the heavy burden of loneliness. It may sound a bit ridiculous, but it's as ordinary as many things in the world. A few drops of plum rain falling when the sun is shining, or hearing the sobbing of a merchant's wife during a lavish feast, often evokes a very bland feeling, which is truly a surprising discovery. As for myself, I sometimes laugh aimlessly with my mouth open, but when the feast is over and I'm alone in my small room, a wave of desolation, I don’t know where it came from, slowly grows in my heart. Dusk, late night, the faint morning light, and quiet, deserted midday are all times when I feel desolation. Loneliness is an incredible phantom, its arrival is silent, its departure is without a trace. Often, just as I pick up my pen, just as I open a book that looks solemn and prepare to start reading, just as I want to reach out and turn on the dim lamp, just as I am inspired by the charming colors of spring flowers and grasses, somehow, on my heart under my shirt, a layer of cloudy shadows, like silk or mist, has already heavily covered it. I want to tear it away, but I can't. If I let it go, the situation is truly difficult to bear. So I sink downwards, head heavy and feet light, until you begin to realize that you are lonely and prepare to try to capture its entire form for a detailed examination, it often slips away like a wisp of smoke. Then you will suddenly realize and say: Hey! It's just a dream!</p>
<p>Dream! That's right! In loneliness, we think of things that are distant from us, which is no different from sleepwalking. I remember that the first time I experienced the taste of loneliness was one evening when I was still living in Beiping—which was then still called Beijing. I was less than ten years old, standing at the foot of the imperial city wall, which was covered with moss and withered grass, gazing at the setting sun, which was getting bigger and bigger, redder and redder, and finally disappeared into the gray tiles of the residential houses. Several sounds of desolate bugles floated up from the foot of the city, and then the sky gradually darkened, darkened. Thousands upon thousands of crows returning to their nests circled above my head, but I still stood motionless. Gradually, I saw rickshaws disappearing, I saw a hunched man walking out of the dusk, coughing, climbing the ladder to light the triangular oil lamps on the street walls, and then I thought about going back. In that instant, a feeling of indescribable sorrow and loneliness suddenly arose in my young heart. I didn't know how to get rid of the time that followed.</p>
<p>In recent years, because of the busyness of life, there are generally fewer times of loneliness. Even if there are, they are like a deserted temple, without any elegant music of bells and chimes, and with few flourishing flowers and trees, losing the poetic charm of the past. Now I am facing the not-very-bright desk lamp, and the sounds of the city climb into my window over the roofs of neighboring houses. My mind is very clear. I am eager to use sweat to heal myself and slowly distance myself from loneliness.</p>
<h3 id="e190">College Days (22) <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Written by German Storm, translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>Later, when the carousel was set up again at the time of the Michael Festival, I hoped to meet her once more. Every night as soon as it got dark, I would go to that square, which greatly annoyed my friend Fritz, because I would always make excuses for being late to dinner. But among the girls riding the carousel, I never saw that slender, brown-haired girl; she was the reason I came. I walked alone through the dark paths in the palace gardens, pensively savoring the memories of that fleeting happiness.</p>
<p>This matter suddenly came to an end: At the beginning of winter that year, I followed my father's wishes and left the liberal arts middle school in this city to study at a science-oriented middle school in central Germany, as preparation for entering university. —Is my butterfly net still hanging on that flowering tree near the wasteland? —I don't know; I never went there again; and I still haven't caught that wooden butterfly to this day.</p>
<p>Several years have passed since then.</p>
<p>That year, after graduating from that collegiate school, I returned to my hometown for a few weeks in early autumn. Among my old friends, only Christoph was left in the old nest; the rest, including Fritz, had flown elsewhere; they were either living the interesting life of a university student, or going overseas to make a living, or sitting in the dark accounting room of some merchant house, in short, going to the places they had chosen or that fate had led them. Even Christoph had grown into a short, stout, and handsome man, and was preparing to leave his hometown, because he had been promoted from apprentice to journeyman and had to travel. But the two of us had to work together one last time in his father's workshop, and the snuffbox that had followed me during my university days was the result of this work. —My mother told me that the sturdy Mrs. Politz had suddenly died a year ago, and her daughter had soon moved to the small city where the state university was located to live with an unmarried old aunt! According to regulations, this old maid was the sole heir to her small fortune. The small house with the linden tree in front was sold by relatives after her death to pay off debts; the French tailor now had to work as a clerk in another tailor shop to make a living. One Sunday afternoon, I met him on the corner of the churchyard, where he was sitting on a bench. The skin on his prominent cheekbones was even yellower, and his black hair had turned completely gray; he was coughing, and the sun seemed to make him feel comfortable. "Ah, Mr. Philip—" he called out, recognizing me, and extended two fingers of his thin hand to me, while the rest of his fingers tightly grasped that familiar porcelain snuffbox. "Those times, ah—things aren't like those times now, Mr. Philip!" he sighed and went on. "The old woman took her household to that black cross over there; as for the girl, Nari—" he choked a few times and poured out a large pile of snuff—"you've probably heard about it!—She didn't want to, she didn't want to leave her poor father to live alone, I had to push her hand away with force. What else could I do! Children should walk their own paths to happiness!" He lowered his head and placed his hands lazily on his knees. "I want to show you the letter she wrote!—" he said after a while, "—you can see that she is very learned! She writes beautifully, and the words she uses are very lovely; a duchess couldn't write better."</p>

<h3 id="e191">Sexual Neurasthenia <a href="#e191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— Feng Shanliang</p>
<p>This disease is not incurable. It relies on the patient's excessive desires and indulgence in a romantic lifestyle. Today, we see the flourishing of science and the advancement of culture. The benefits that humanity has gained from science are truly unimaginable. In recent years, medical skills in various European countries have developed, and new joys are emerging endlessly. The harm of germs has decreased almost imperceptibly. In general, half of people's illnesses are caused by the invasion of germs. There are also cases where germs do not invade, but the illness is caused by human actions, nothing more than self-harm. This is what is called neurasthenia. Originally, neurasthenia can also arise from other symptoms, but according to what I have seen and heard in my clinical practice, almost all cases related to sexual neurasthenia are such. According to the self-reports of general young people, in their youth, due to carelessness in making friends, they engage in a romantic lifestyle, recklessly seeking love, pursuing their objects of desire, or secretly watching lewd and obscene words, as well as masturbation and prostitution, etc., all kinds of unconscious destruction and damage to the body are not cherished, and they continue to indulge in the haze. When the morbid state manifests, they feel mentally exhausted, have lower back pain and weak legs, dizziness and lightheadedness, as well as loss of sleep and appetite. Even after this disease has occurred, some people do not become afraid of it and still pursue their desires. When they realize the situation, they see symptoms such as seminal emission and impotence occurring, and they become frightened and remorseful. Therefore, they have no choice but to seek help from a doctor. It should be known that the sacred duty of a doctor is to protect the health of the people. However, there are some misguided patients who turn a deaf ear to the doctor's earnest advice. When the disease reaches an irreparable state, they look to the doctor as if hoping for clouds and rain. Recalling the crisis of the disease, there is a possibility of forcefully seizing the happiness of life. How can we not be careful! As for the medication for treating this disease, "An Er Shen" is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>(Editor's note: The sales location for An Er Shen tablets is Ren Shou Western Medicine Store, No. 1 Lao De Hang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai. Each box is 1.5 yuan, plus 1 yuan for postage. Dr. Feng Shanliang is good at treating neurasthenia. The Chun Zai Hospital he runs is well-equipped and employs male and female doctors. Various electrical equipment, injections, and all procedures are cheaper than most.)</p>
<h3 id="e192">Gonorrhea <a href="#e192" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c192" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">192</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Cui Fuqing</p>
<p>This disease is related to unclean intercourse. Two days or a week later, when urinating, one feels itching, burning, and pain. A discharge or pus is initially seen at the urethral opening. The source of the disease is the invasion of the urethra by gonococcus. Now, I will analyze its structure as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Acute anterior urethral gonorrhea: There is a large amount of pus discharge from the urethra, severe pain during urination, occasional swelling of the penis, and pain during nighttime erections. It is also accompanied by complications of inguinal lymphadenitis and inflammation of the dorsal lymphatic vessels of the penis. After about three weeks, the pain decreases, and the pus discharge gradually reduces.</p>
<p>(2) Acute posterior urethral gonorrhea: It moves from the anterior urethra to the posterior urethra. When urinating, there is severe pain in the perineum, and there are drops of blood at the end of urination. Blood is also mixed in the urine. For differentiation, use two glass cups. The patient urinates half of the urine into the first cup, and then urinates the other half into the second cup. If the first cup is cloudy and the second cup is clear, this is anterior urethritis. If the first cup is thick and cloudy, and the second cup is slightly thinner and cloudy, this is posterior urethritis.</p>
<p>In many cases, anterior and posterior urethral gonorrhea, during treatment, turns into chronic anterior and posterior urethral gonorrhea. In the morning, there is a mucus-like substance sealing the urethral opening, and other severe pain symptoms disappear. There are a few gonorrhea threads remaining in the clear urine. For differentiation, prepare two cups as described above, and it will become clear. For oral medication for this disease, the best is "Mie Sha Lin" produced by Mei Ling Foreign Company. For topical external medication, the best is German Man Er Zhi mixed gonorrhea vaccine Gonorrhea Soother. Both of these drugs are sold by Ren Shou Western Medicine Store, No. 1 Lao De Hang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai. The former is 1 yuan per pot, and the latter is 2.5 yuan per can, plus 1 yuan for postage.</p>
<h3 id="e193">Gastric Atony <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Ma Fangweng</p>
<p>Stomach diseases are of two types: primary and secondary. Primary diseases are mostly caused by congenital or neurological disorders, while secondary diseases originate from other stomach diseases, such as gastric ptosis, nervous dyspepsia, gastric ulcers, chronic gastritis, and intestinal strictures, pancreatic tumors, gallstones, etc. of other organs.</p>
<p>This disease begins with irregular eating habits, leading to indigestion. The stomach often feels full, and the amount of food consumed gradually decreases. There is a lack of appetite, the stomach feels full, and the patient feels mentally weak, with belching, headaches, or dizziness. In addition to drug treatment, patients must also try to reduce the causes of the disease and add appropriate healthcare methods. As for healthcare methods, the timing of meals must be regular. Foods that cause irritation should be completely avoided. Daily meals should consist of vegetables and noodles. The reason for a vegetarian diet is nothing more than to reduce the stimulation of fish and meat fats and promote gastric motility. With the addition of drug treatment, it is not difficult to restore the original state. The "Wei Bao" sold on the market is an essential medicine for treating all stomach diseases. Its ingredients not only reduce organic acids but also increase oxygen. The drug is currently sold by Ren Shou Western Medicine Store, No. 1 Lao De Hang Lane, Mintiniyin Road, Ba Xian Qiao, French Concession, Shanghai. Each box is 2 yuan, plus 1 yuan for postage.</p>
<h3 id="e194">Opium <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Sun Jiwu</p>
<p>The toxicity of opium lies in anesthesia, which can excite a tired spirit. Over time, the human body gradually develops a kind of anti-opium toxin due to prolonged exposure to opium, eventually becoming chronic poisoning (commonly known as opium addiction). Once addicted, if one suddenly stops smoking, the original antitoxin in the body, having nothing to resist, causes a special change in the whole body's tissues and cells, and suffering immediately appears, such as yawning, tearing, sweating, soreness in the limbs, joint pain, and collapse. Those who are mild feel uneasy in body and mind, while those who are severe may die immediately, and they must smoke again to stop it. Therefore, those who are addicted to this often have an addiction but are unwilling to quit, not because they do not know the advantages and disadvantages, but because they fear that there are no good doctors or medicines to safely remove it. Modern medicine is flourishing, and there are many good methods for quitting opium. Serum can remove the anti-opium toxin, and lecithin and Cibamin can restore the body's strength during withdrawal. My old friend She Lei is currently practicing medicine at Chun Zai Hospital, No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai. He has deep experience in quitting opium, and his techniques are new and superb. In addition to using serum, he also uses Cibamin and lecithin to maintain the body's strength of those quitting. Newspaper praises are visible everywhere. Dr. She is skilled in internal medicine, and he can skillfully treat diseases during the opium withdrawal period, so that those undergoing withdrawal do not feel any pain, which is his strength. The opium withdrawal fees set by Chun Zai Hospital are also very low, charging only 2 yuan per day, regardless of the amount of opium smoked, and all internal medicine, injections, and other fees are completely included. Those with a small addiction can be completely removed in about four or five days. Those who are addicted, why not turn back to the shore early.</p>
<h3 id="e195">On Gonorrhea in Women <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. Liu Xuannu</p>
<p>Gonorrhea in women is caused by unclean intercourse and is divided into acute and chronic types. Proportionally, gonorrhea is more common in women than in men, and its treatment is not as easy as in men. In the early stages of infection, the vulva is slightly red and swollen, and a large amount of pus-like secretions are discharged from the vaginal opening and urethra. This type of inflammation can also affect the cervix and invade the uterus, harming the ovaries and fallopian tubes, or it can enter the bladder from the urethra, causing inflammation of the ureters and kidneys. If acute gonorrhea is not treated in time, it quickly turns into chronic gonorrhea. The vulva, labia majora, and labia minora are red and swollen, and urination feels hot and painful. Severe cases cause frequent urination (the urge to urinate frequently), or it can invade the cervix and uterine cavity, causing soreness in the lower back and a feeling of tenderness. Acute gonorrhea can even cause chills, fever, and pain. In chronic gonorrhea, all kinds of inflammation disappear, and it enters the latent period. However, during intercourse or menstruation, the secretions increase slightly. As a result, gonorrhea often induces ovaritis and peritonitis, which can be fatal. Also, due to the downward flow of secretions or the rubbing of menstrual belts and underpants, gonococci can enter the anus, causing anal gonorrhea. Its treatment requires a specialist doctor to use appropriate surgery to wash the vaginal canal and uterus, and then supplement it with effective drugs, plus self-cultivation, to have hope of recovery. The most difficult thing is to abstain from sexual intercourse. Treatment for both parties can obtain the hope of complete eradication, otherwise, this decreases and that increases, and they will never be able to leave the sea of suffering.</p>
<h3 id="e196">On Electrotherapy <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— (Sun Zhiyao)</p>
<p>The world is prospering, and more and more machines are being invented. In the past, the power of medicine was used to treat diseases and obtain recovery, but this is not the case now. Electrotherapy means using electricity to treat diseases. The term electrotherapy has a broad scope, and there are many types and names of electrotherapy equipment, and the field of treatment can be said to be extremely broad. What I am talking about is limited to stating the usefulness of electricity in treating gonorrhea and skin diseases.</p>
<p>Electrotherapy for gonorrhea has been extremely popular in recent years, and the medical community also attaches great importance to it. Electrotherapy for gonorrhea is most suitable for short-wave diathermy, which has extremely rapid results. We know that gonococci are latent in the inner layer of the mucous membrane. Once the gonococci encounter extreme heat, they will die. The so-called extreme heat is about 40 degrees Celsius. In terms of short-wave electricity, there are also two different ways to use it. To utilize its heat, a wavelength of 30 meters is always used. To utilize its power, a wavelength of 15 meters is always used. In short, using short-wave for gonorrhea, using a wavelength of 30 meters to utilize its heat is better than 15 meters. For skin diseases such as scabies, eczema, and stubborn diseases, irradiating them with a high-altitude sun lamp with ultraviolet rays will cure all skin conditions without exception. The principle of this treatment is to rely on the power of light to kill bacteria and achieve rapid results. This is a brief description of the principle of this therapy, which I believe will be welcomed by people in society.</p>

Wei Bao, a good medicine for stomach diseases, is a special preparation for the treatment of chronic gastritis. All stomach ailments, such as stomach pain and vomiting, are effective in eliminating the disease. Dr. Ma Fangweng, an expert in gastroenterology, still uses this medicine, which shows its value. Mie Sha Lin, an oral medicine for gonorrhea, can deeply penetrate the mucous membrane to kill bacteria. It has the same effect on acute and chronic gonorrhea and its sequelae. Dr. Zhang Shouming, a saint in the treatment of gonorrhea, always uses it clinically. Mie Jue Jun, a holy medicine for the skin, is especially effective for scabies, stubborn ringworm, and severe skin conditions. Dr. Wu Sheng, a skin disease expert, highly recommends this medicine. An Er Shen AROLSEN, which specializes in treating neurasthenia, functions to calm the nerves and restore the abnormal state in a short period. Dr. Feng Shanbiao of Chun Zai Hospital, No. 66 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, enjoys using this medicine. GONO-SEROL, a liquid urethral injection made from mixed gonorrhea bacteria, is a local treatment based on science. Ordinary gonorrhea injections are all drug bactericidal methods, and cannot be compared. Dr. She Lei appreciates using this medicine clinically and has written articles to introduce it, which shows its grand effect.</p>

<h3 id="e199">Mr. A-Wang's Painful Conversation <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— Qiong Sheng</p>
<p>Recently, the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia over Italy's attempt to conquer Abyssinia has become increasingly urgent. Italian troops are constantly being transported to African colonies, and Abyssinia is also training its troops and preparing for war for the independence and survival of its nation. Given this tense situation, if the League of Nations truly advocates justice and righteousness, the central issue should naturally be how to immediately stop Italy's aggressive ambitions and restrain them with effective measures. However, it turns a deaf ear and pretends to be mute, just carrying on with mediation and arbitration, going through the motions.</p>
<p>Of course, the League of Nations has its own reasons for its understated mediation and arbitration. The reason is that this difficult problem that is not easy to solve is left to the behind-the-scenes bosses to negotiate directly, either to divide the spoils or to break up, without the League of Nations having to pay attention to it. Recently, Eden's "despair" after his visit to Rome, as well as the widely rumored breakup of the Anglo-French-Italian united front, are the result of these leading jing-speakers being unable to divide the loot equally. Therefore, the news from London says: The powers are willing to divide Abyssinia, with a part of it becoming an Italian protectorate, or Abyssinia being divided into several spheres of influence, but Italy is unwilling to accept any conditions for a peaceful solution (a dispatch from the 1st).</p>
<p>The business principles of imperialist haggling have their own goals in the same bed but different dreams. Although they are dissatisfied with Italy's sole appropriation, in terms of the overall interests of imperialism, they absolutely do not want Abyssinia to truly become a reality of national independence and liberation. Therefore, amid the voices of "peace" from various countries, there has been a cessation of arms shipments to Abyssinia. However, Abyssinia's Chief of Staff Lu Chang issued a statement saying: Can anyone point out where Abyssinia has not fulfilled its obligations as a member of the League of Nations? Even if the civilized countries cannot prevent the war, at least they should not prevent Abyssinia from purchasing self-defense tools. If the Italo-Abyssinian war breaks out, even if there is only one person and one gun left, they will persevere to the end. The future success or failure of Abyssinia can be put aside for the moment, but such a strong and courageous spirit is already admirable.</p>
<h3 id="e200">Passing He Kou <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>—Laoxin</p>
<p>Every time I go upstream on the West River, I always pass through this small town of He Kou. Because I've been there so many times, I've gradually become familiar with it.</p>
<p>Sometimes, because the boat doesn't necessarily arrive right away when the train does, there are many times when I have a short stay in this small town. This is not just how I have become familiar with this small town; almost everyone who travels this waterway of the West River is familiar with this small town. By the same token, this small town is also prosperous because of the comings and goings of us travelers.</p>
<p>The West River is a famously wild river, and it often floods wildly. Almost every year when the river rises, it goes wild, stirring up endless storms and destroying the small towns along the river. He Kou is naturally no exception. However, precisely because the West River is a wild river and people are afraid of it, the route from Guangzhou to He Kou has been changed to land and switched to trains. That quickly made this unknown small town prosperous, because after everyone changed to land routes, He Kou became an essential transit station.</p>
<p>When you come out of the 'Guangsan Train,' following the road from the station, without any doubt, just keep walking, and you will reach the shore where the boats are docked. Along the way, you will be surprised by the countless women, using their uniquely sharp and delicate voices, calling out to you:</p>
<p>"Sir, Zhaoqing ferry! It's about to leave."</p>
<p>"Going to Wuzhou, the ×× Fast Ferry is about to depart."</p>
<p>"Sir, barge!..."</p>
<p>This chorus of voices will penetrate your ears. If you are quick, you can call one of them and agree to have them transport you in their boat to the Wuzhou boat or barge anchored on the water. You can hand over your luggage to them without any effort on your part. If you are a seasoned traveler on this waterway, you can just walk straight to the shore. Anyway, they won't rob you of your belongings; they are just working to make a living. People who are new to Guangdong will definitely find them strange, because they are one of the savage races, as the great Dr. Hu Shi said. According to countless anthropological studies, they are all pure savages. They live on the sea, and their home is a small boat with a canopy. Their name, in academic terms, is "Dan people," but we call them "Dan family girls." They, like the dock coolies, use their physical strength to earn money.</p>
<p>The small town of He Kou belongs to Sanshui County. Because it is relatively well-known, many people mistakenly believe it is the county seat of Sanshui, but in fact, the county seat of Sanshui is still at Lubao across the sea. There are countless food shops here, probably because their purpose is primarily to serve travelers, so they are all simple but complete. Every time I come from Guangzhou or return from Zhaoqing, I always stay here for a while.</p>
<p>Last year, after the West River rose, I went from Guangzhou to Guangning again. When I got off the 'Guangsan Train,' I felt something was different. Not only were there fewer "Dan family girls," but the place was also much more desolate. Therefore, as I walked out of the station, I kept wondering, looking at the traces of erosion caused by the floodwater at the station, and I felt a sense of infinite regret. When I got to the shore, I still followed the old routine and sat at Li Xiuji's fish congee shop to eat something.</p>
<p>"Why, it seems much more deserted this year?"</p>
<p>I asked the waiters with a questioning tone. They replied:</p>
<p>"Well, the rotten ×'s stinky water flooded us for ten or eight days. Of course it's deserted. We're lucky to be able to reopen our shop. Many Dan family girls don't want to come back from Zhaoqing. It's like this every year, it's really hopeless!..."</p>
<p>I left this small town, which had lost its vitality, with a sense of sadness.</p>
<p>This year, I have no chance to travel this waterway again. Now, from this big city five days away by water, I see news again about the wild West River flooding, and I can't help but think of this small town that has not yet recovered its vitality. When I think about it in the quiet night, I also murmur:</p>
<p>"It's like this every year, it's really hopeless!"</p>

<p>Five-year-old Xiao Xiao lay on the grass, gazing at the sky in a daze. A few white clouds were slowly moving in the wind.</p>
<p>"Brother, what do you think that looks like?" she said.</p>
<p>Seven-year-old Pei Pei looked up and said, "It looks like a tiger's head. Look how big that curved mouth is!"</p>
<p>"Brother, look, next to it, the pointy shape looks like a woman's face."</p>
<p>"It looks like sister's face, she even has a perm."</p>
<p>Just then, a gust of wind came, and the white cloud that resembled a tiger's head scattered the shape of the woman's face.</p>
<p>"Ah! Sister has been swallowed by the tiger!" Pei Pei clapped his hands and said.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao didn't say a word, just kept looking at the sky, and suddenly, she burst into tears.</p>
<p>Pei Pei was stunned and said, "Sister, why?"</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao could only cry, her mouth wide open; tears dripped onto the grass.</p>
<p>Pei Pei panicked, looking at his wooden horse, as if he wanted the</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>wooden horse to answer his question.</p>
<p>"Sister, do you want my ball?"</p>
<p>Sister shook her head, her hair all damp with tears.</p>
<p>Pei Pei was confused; he stared at his sister with wide eyes. After a long time, Pei Pei's tears involuntarily fell on his sister's face, but he didn't know why he was crying.</p>
<p>"Did Pei Pei upset his sister again?"</p>
<p>Mom heard the crying and rushed out of the house.</p>
<p>Sister didn't care that she was barefoot, she ran straight to her mother; she grabbed her mother's clothes and said, "Mom... Mom, Sister... was... swallowed... by the tiger!" As she spoke, she pointed to the sky with her little finger.</p>
<p>Mom laughed.</p>
<p>"Who said that?"</p>
<p>"Brother said it."</p>
<p>"Pei Pei, why are you teasing your sister?"</p>
<p>"I didn't tease her. There was a cloud that looked like a tiger's head, and another cloud that looked like sister's face. Then the tiger's head scattered sister's face. So I said, 'Sister was swallowed by the tiger.' That's why sister cried," Pei Pei said, clapping his little hands and laughing.</p>
<p>"Xiao Xiao, be good, don't cry, sister is fine in the house."</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao didn't believe her, tears still falling from her face.</p>
<p>"Look, isn't that sister coming?" Pei Pei said, jumping up and down.</p>
<p>Xiao Xiao struggled out of her mother's arms, stumbled and ran to meet her sister.</p>
<p>"Sister, you weren't dragged away by the tiger?"</p>
<p>Sister didn't understand her words; she only asked, "Xiao Xiao, why are you crying like this?"</p>
<p>Mother told her everything, and sister felt as if that tiger's head was really going to devour her, and she wanted to cry too.</p>

<h3 id="e206">Anecdotes Welcoming Zhou and Hu's Return to China <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>It's hard for Mr. Zhou and Ms. Hu</p>
<p>When the McKinley arrived at the Jianghaiguan Wharf, the shore was full of cars and people. As soon as they stepped onto the shore, they were busy nodding and shaking hands, simply overwhelmed; the general reporters were busy taking pictures, interviewing, and requesting interviews; the crowd of people squeezed them so tightly that it was difficult to move, and Mr. Zhou and his wife and Ms. Hu were covered in sweat.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Jianyun at the Welcome Meeting</p>
<p>Zhou and Hu returned to China. On the afternoon of the 8th, at 2 o'clock, all the colleagues of the Star Company held a meeting to welcome them. Mr. Zhou stood up and reported everything he had seen and heard abroad. He was passionate and impassioned when it was painful, and made people smile knowingly when it was humorous. In a continuous speech of more than two hours, he reported on their experiences in the Soviet Union and Europe, and talked about the current political situation, customs, and feelings of various countries that Zhou had seen and heard during his travels. His mouth was like a hanging river, endless; and every sentence and word could shake people's hearts. In such a long time, not only was Mr. Zhou's spirit not tired at all, but all the listeners were also very inspired and moved. Mr. Zhou is not only a shrewd, capable, and powerful film entrepreneur, but also a talented speaker.</p>
<p>Hu Die in the Mouth of Old Master Zheng</p>
<p>At the welcome meeting, Mr. Zhou Jianyun reported on Ms. Hu Die. Her Mandarin is very good, her attitude is very calm, and her words are very humble. At the end, he said: This time abroad, I have not made the progress that everyone expected, and I am very ashamed. I hope that my comrades will not hesitate to guide me, so that I can work harder and move towards the road to success. Later, Old Master Na introduced in public, saying: "Miss Hu is really too modest. Aside from anything else, just take her concise report and appropriate speech just now, and compare it with her speech when she went abroad. This alone proves that she has made amazing progress."</p>
<p>Very Excited Zheng Zhengqiu</p>
<p>Old Master Zheng Zhengqiu is very thin. Everyone knows that she is a weak and frail male Lin Daiyu. She spends seven or eight days in bed out of ten. Her voice is low, and she is usually silent most of the time. But on the day Zhou and Hu returned to China, at the welcome Zhou and Hu meeting, Old Master Zheng's face was radiant, his voice was particularly loud, and his words were very humorous, which made everyone laugh at him. He himself said that his spirit was particularly excited and happy that day compared to usual.</p>
<p>Grabbing Bread</p>
<p>The welcome meeting lasted a long time. When the meeting adjourned, it was after 6 o'clock in the afternoon. Everyone's stomach seemed to be panicking. Then, a talking sound came from a corner, "What?" "Snack tickets." "Do you have one?" For a moment, everyone at the meeting got it, and in such a happy mood, everyone went to the place to collect snacks, and each hand exchanged a snack coupon for a package of bread and cake, and immediately began to munch on it.</p>

<p>—Great Shanghai Reflection</p>
<p>"Crazy Night of Wind and Rain" is the first thunder prepared by the Jinan Company after its reopening. The play has a profound meaning, directed by Feng Ting and written by his younger brother Feng Yiwei. The Kun brothers are both young and handsome, and their thoughts are intelligent, but whether they will succeed is still unpredictable.</p>
