<h3>日本軍人　昨又在大連開會　岡村携東京訓令參加　外務省亦將討論歐局</h3>
<p>（大連）關束軍及華北日駐軍參謀官會議、今日午後已在此間開初步談話、　明日正式開幕、陸軍參謀本部岡村少將亦與會任主度、岡村於今晨由東京抵此、將在會解釋日本對華新政策、該會議將歷三日之久、駐莫斯科日六使署之陸軍委員八田中佐、定今日到此參加討論、（十二日珞透電）</p>

<p>（大連）參謀本部之岡村少將因出席當地之武官會議、於今晨八時乘哈爾濱丸抵此岡村少將對記者之談話如下、此次會議並無似外間所傳之甚係召集駐華官憲各機關傳達中央之方針並聽取當地之情形、余對歐洲之狀况、亦擬詳細言之、有謂余之此次來連、係緩和當地方面之强硬態度、實則中央與當地間、意見决無參商、完全出諸臆測、又尚擬與松岡滿鐵總裁懇談華北經濟問題云、（十二日電通電）</p>
<p>（東京）外務省定於二十二日召開外務參議會、松平駐英大使以下各留京大使公使、及外務省之廣由外相重光次官以下各局部長等、均將出席、以意阿戰事爲中心、懇談歐洲問題、繼且擬恊議對華政策、（十二日電通電</p>
<h3>日本對華政策　廣田將向蔣使說明</h3>
<p>（東京）中國駐日大使蔣作賓不日回國、出席六中全會五全大會、廣田外相擬於蔣大使離日前會見蔣氏、說明日本對華政策、此項對華政策係由外務·大藏·陸海軍四省會議决定者、（十一日日聯電）</p>
<p>（東京）意阿戰開、日本對華外交之方向、亦因而急轉、卽廣田外相與川島軍部間之對華方策、漸趨一致、此後卽澈底淸算軍部與外務之二重外交、確立對華之鞏固的一元外交、（十二日華聯電）</p>
<h3>倫敦各界不信　英對華貸款說　羅斯爵士無權作何建議</h3>
<p>（倫敦）此間消息靈通各界對於中國方面所傅、英政府首席經濟顧問羅斯爵士建議供給中國借欵之說、全不之信、財政家頗非笑此說、謂爵士之赴華、初無成見、並未挾有任何豫定方案、决不致奉命提出此項建議、英國現仍受銀行團之約束不單獨貨欵與中國、再任何借欵、必公開募之、今未聞曾與銀行商榷此事、足徵其不可信、路透訪員曾遍訪與中國有關係之各界、知此項謠言、實由中國投機家有勢力之團體所傳出、彼等之活動、現已引起倫敦方面甚不佳之印象、</p>
<p>另訊馬可尼借欵與維克斯借欵之執券者共同委員會近曾以向中政府追索欠欵之進行情形傳告執券者、謂與孔財長進行之談判、近爲上海之財政恐慌所打斷、但並未終止、羅斯爵士曾應該委員會之請、携借欵備忘錄至華俾與當道討論辦法、傳單中又謂委員會曾屢謂外交部注意在一切舊欠未滿意淸理以前、而以新借欵供給中國、此爲至不公允之事云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（東京）日本對華借欵團之代表銀行興業·台灣·朝鮮·三銀行定於二十四日邀請中國考察團（十二日日聯電）</p>
<h3>艾登廣播演說　英國决不退縮　亦不單獨施行制裁</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯英總代表艾登今日在此播音演說、以告英阿聽衆、中有言曰、「吾人旣担任莊嚴之義務、决不退縮、」艾登詳述國聯之工作、謂毫未有所遲延、現已有五十國切實表示願戰爭早日終止、續曰、當人類正在被殺並毀家之際、吾人進行一切、不能稍延、如意國能轉向和平之路、則歡悅者莫英國若、惟吾人旣担任莊嚴之義務、决不退縮、今事已迅速開始矣、就英政府而論、吾人旣已開始、則當堅忍進行一切云、（十一日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日負責方面切實聲明、除日內瓦制裁委員會所議决者外、英政府不欲實施對意制裁、英政府未計議何種片面行動云、意總代表阿洛錫日者曾由一美國新聞家協助、與倫敦某美國公司商妥作播音演說、傳至美國、英當道未予以必要之便利、致此間意人大爲悻悻今日已由英當道聲明、此事不能作爲制裁論、蓋阿氏播音之申請、爲時太促、不能作尋常必要之準備、故英政府乃决議却之、此種誤會、旣經釋明、當不致再疑及英政府之舉措云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）官方今日蹬實國會將提早一星期、於本月二十二日開會之說、按此爲內閣本月九日决議如民衆認爲必要、則國會將提前開會之結果、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>國聯委員會擬定　財政制裁辦法　禁止一切對意放欵</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）制裁方案調整委員會所組織之十六國小組委員會、於昨日指定英·法·希臘·南菲·荷蘭·羅馬尼亞·波蘭等七國組織股員會、討論關於財政制裁之建議案、該股員會於今日舉行非公開會議、當經草定下列各項財政制裁措置、</p>
<p>（一）禁止貸欵於侵略國家</p>
<p>（二）禁止代侵略國家發行公債</p>
<p>（三）禁止由隸屬或代表侵略國之個人或法人出面發行公債</p>
<p>（四）禁止放欵於侵略國之銀行</p>
<p>（五）除商業性質之放欵外對於隸屬或代</p>
<p>表侵略國之個人或法人禁止銀行放欽</p>
<p>（六）禁北商業性質之銀行放欵</p>
<p>（七）禁止平常商業放欵</p>
<p>以上各項措置、經股員會於午後會議中、决定全部採納、送請調整委員會加以採擇、此外股員會决定不擬禁止對侵略國之長期商業放欵云、（十二哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）十六國委員會今日草竣對意制裁計劃、其動作計分三步、現正待五十國委員會核准施行、其內容如下、</p>
<p>（一）全世界禁止軍火輸往意國、准許英·法·比·捷克·及瑞典取消對阿軍火禁令、</p>
<p>（二）全世界抵制意貨、</p>
<p>（三）各國拒絕對意放欵、</p>
<p>軍火封鎖可望於明日實行、惟若干國家因法律手續上之困難、或將延緩數日、此項封鎖將以美總統羅斯福所頒佈之淸單爲根據、此舉係出英代表艾登之建議、惟曾加炸藥一項、五十國委員會業已核准封餓軍火、明日卽可决定禁止放欵問題、至下屋期一討論抵制意貨、據可靠方面消息、英國並擬建議提回對意存金、並聞艾登今日告其他代表稱、他國如提議撤回駐意使節、英國亦樂於贊同云、（十一日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）制裁委員會今日組織若千小組委員會、襄助進行一切　第一小組委員會以英·法·希臘·荷蘭·南菲·羅馬尼亞·波蘭代表組成之、專事辦理緊迫意國債務等之財政問題、另一小組委員會以英·法·俄·西班牙·代表組成之、將審查軍器並主要產品問題、本日制裁委員會會開全體會議、通過十六國委員會所提出維持對意戰品供給禁令而取銷對阿同樣禁令之建議、匈代表未投票委員會又一致贊成艾登提出之建議、軍火禁令應包括現行之合同在內、並通過羅斯福總統近根據美國中立法禁止以戰品供給交戰國時所擬之名目單、蓋視此爲有實效而便利也、明日財政小組委員會集議時、將主張禁止予意國以一切財政通融、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>意謂對國聯制裁　早作秘密準備　並謂國聯挑戰必須對抗</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意國與情關於制裁對經濟地位之影響不特僅及意國且將遍及全世界、自不免中心惶恐、但仍堅决主張國聯之挑戰、必須與之對抗、此間政界隱露意國早作應付國聯實施經濟制裁之各種必要準備、此項準備迄今嚴守秘密云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）此間政界對於制裁委員會取銷對阿軍火輸出禁令、而對意則厲行此項禁令之行動、似頗鈸靜、某要員今日對路透訪員發表政府方面之意見、謂吾人久已準備應付制裁所發生之影饗、故並不因此驚惶、又稱、軍械製造商須以軍械賒與阿政府、蓋吾人以爲阿政府現無多金可付也云、（十一日路透電）</p>
<h3>赫爾表示　美國不能追隨　惟史汀生主與國聯合作</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）調整對意制裁委員會雖已决議取消對阿軍火之禁令、但美政府將不步其後塵、國務總理赫爾今日宣稱、美國中立法案不許美國與國聯採同一步驟、該法案規定嚴禁軍用品輸往交戰國、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）此間外交家宣稱、據今日現勢觀察、美國對於國聯對意制裁頗表同情、美國駐英大使賓漢今日訪外相霍爾、霍氏曾告以英國對於國聯制裁之全部意見、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）前國務總理史汀遜今日力主擴大美國與國聯之台作、以制止意阿戰爭、史氏此項主張係在其致紐約泰晤土報之函中發表、謂禁止軍火輸出尚不足挽回美國捲入旋渦之危機現覺美國棉花與其他貨物之售與意國、不久將引起美國與國聯會員國之嚴重衝突云、（十一日國民電）</p>
<h3>日本暫行旁觀　英與德談判說</h3>
<p>（東京）此間外交觀察家謂外務省當局對於國聯對意實施制裁之舉、現抱旁觀態度、彼等以爲日本對於制裁、今未便表明態度、尤其因奧匈兩國旣持異　、國聯難期維持一致之陣綫也、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間財政界今日對於英德談判之說頗感興味據稱希特勒可允不阻撓國聯對意制裁、回時英則允德在英募債以為交換條件、惟此間尚未能證實此說、據可靠方面宣稱、德國早有在、眾債之動　、今日得悉英國甚望希特勒擁護國聯制裁意國、因使此項債欵漸增希望、英國並通知法國、稱英國在對意經濟壓力未見成效之前、不欲贊同其他計劃、並聞英國　總選以前、不欲封鎖意國、總選大槪將在十一月間舉行、但法國得悉、此項選舉或將提早舉行、因鮑爾溫政府急欲得悉民意、然後决定其行動也、如英國人民贊成封鎖政策、則英法關係勢將發生變化、因法國　將拒絕與英共同採取溢出經濟範圍之制裁也、卽反對經濟制裁之示威運動每日在巴黎市街出現、且有與日俱增之勢、路旁樹幹張貼非　國聯計劃之標語、責其將使　國捲入旋渦、至於英國大使館自右翼極端派抨擊英國引誘法國加入對意制裁後、業已增加衛隊、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>意軍準備二次進攻　擬在阿中部高原會師　截斷鐵路使阿京孤立</h3>
<p>北路意軍前綫　北路全綫今日仍甚沉寂、據軍事佈置觀之大舉攻擊已在準備中、阿方叛軍格夫柴酉長率衆十人、已到達意軍陣綫、此軍降意於軍事上頗有影響、此後北路與東路意軍可以不折一矢取得聯絡、而鐵路綫之被截亦易如反掌矣、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據今晨戰報云阿克森已完全爲意軍包圍北路意軍二支隊同時亦已準備向中部高原大舉進攻、第一目標爲鐵路綫、第二目標即爲阿京、第一軍團正向左翼進展、以佔據通達馬克爾之駱駝路爲目標（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）此間接法屬索馬里之吉波蒂消息、攻入阿境之三路意軍、現信其計畫乃圖在阿國中央高原會合、而截吉波蒂通阿京之鐵路、使阿京階於孤立之地位、聞一縱隊現距哈拉爾不足五十哩、該地爲由意屬索馬里進攻之主要目的物、吉阿鐵路經過距哈拉爾西北三十哩之某地點、故由哈拉爾進、達該路，比較迅易、意軍將任令該路通車至該路主要車站所在之狄里達華、其地距伊阿界綫西南一百十哩、惟阿軍或將自己截斷該路目前該路主要關係僅屬由哈拉爾境輸送糧食至阿京耳、意軍由索馬里向西南進攻、其便利因素之一、厥爲土人若干、因阿皇曾沒收彼等之糧食、皆抱悲望、阿軍現固守距阿杜華東南六十五哩之馬加爾、以待竟軍由阿杜華附近進攻、同時攻入阿國東北隅達那基爾境之意軍、現向沃薩、方面推進、但因阿人曾置鹽於該區諸井、而使井水不能飲用、故意軍之進攻、頗受妨碍、（十二日路透電）</p>
<h3>東南路　阿軍亦取攻勢　東北路戰事沉寂</h3>
<p>阿京　今日此間接狄里達華來訊、阿軍已在東南陣綫取攻勢、佔據華爾華爾華台爾·索桀·三地皆在沃迦登省內、同時聞意軍在北阿蒂格里境從事鞏固陣地、在兩星期內不致在該區續行進攻、阿國東北隅戰事沉寂、該區意軍自佔據茅薩阿里山後、未圖繼續推進、（十一日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　據哈瓦斯社隨軍記者報告、阿杜華南面頃發生新戰事、阿軍總指揮加薩將軍及蒂格爾省長賽雄將軍所率部隊已包圍意軍陣地、俘虜甚衆、並奪獲意軍大砲步槍及子彈無數、雙方損失均甚鉅、傳聞當兩軍激戰時意軍阿斯加利土着部隊突然逃亡、其中伊里特里亞士兵數百名自動携械向阿軍投誠、雙力裏應外合、意軍遂遭潰敗云、南部軍訊、官方承認意軍繼續向沃加丹區域前綫進展、又意軍五萬人正向哈拉爾及鐵路進迫、阿軍現避免主力衝突、僅用游擊戰應付意軍、（十一日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿斯馬拉　意軍所佔阿國北境各地及所威脅地段內之阿酋長、現紛紛投降、據傳意軍之前進、幾類和平之開拓、路透社特訪員與意軍將士接觸、及訪問各醫院後、知外間所傳意軍大受損失之說實爲無稽之　、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　今日此間接訊、意屬伊利特里之阿瑪西亞　落現怨聲四起、使該地意軍司令大戚不安、該部落民衆、皆爲未開化之野蠻、現有叛變之象云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>阿京　官方雖堅稱並（接到奪回阿杜華之消息、但美聯社記者自可靠方面得悉、阿軍確曾奪回該城此項消息雖未證實、但確實可靠、並聲明前傳阿軍進攻殱減並俘獲意軍二千五百名之說、此外奪獲軍火及其他軍需甚多（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>哈拉　此間今日戰報云、意軍飛機轟炸威比及斯格特里兩鎭、死傷甚衆泰半係婦孺多數村落被炸一空、其中有泰法里及加泰馬兩村屬於沃加登省中部重要之部落、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>北路意軍前綫　當此謠言如麻官方消息互有出入之際、中立觀察者現以爲截至現在止、北路意軍進攻阿比西尼亞所遭之損失比較甚微、意軍現已完成聯合工作、準備第一次之眞正進攻、阿軍至今尚未眞正抵抗、而僅專事遊擊、靜待意軍深入山區、遠離接濟、然後大舉反攻、美聯社記者今日往訪阿杜華、證明歷次戰事陣亡兵士數千人之說不確、意軍正繼續向前推進、惟以充份時間集中小型坦克車及馬達化軍隊、並開闢道路、今日得悉、意軍現正沿阿杜華之綫推進以備聯絡進攻、（十一日國民電）</p>

<p>阿京　意使又西伯爵與陸軍委員加爾特里亞尼大佐今日宣稱、彼等現自閉於使署中、非俟駐阿諸意領事全已安然出境、不願離署、阿京人士聞此消息、咸爲　異、阿當局現派騎步兵嚴衛該使署、不欲　用威力迫令二人離此、但恐或有出此之必要、阿皇現正親自考慮此事、另一　人之事、爲運送意使署人員赴吉波蒂之火車、中有一等秘書德特里尼、今日忽　洮逸、卽有兵士乘馬逹自動車與街車緊追於後卒將該員拘獲、押至車站、旋仍置之火車中、由氏上　　　、（十二日路透電）</p>

<h3>昨第六屆全運會第三日　男女田徑創新紀錄三項　女鐵餅跳遠男八百公尺均破紀錄　球類比賽逐漸吃緊興趣日漸增加</h3>
<p>全國運動大會、昨爲第三日、天氣尙佳、惟觀衆則大减、男女田徑昨又造全國新紀錄三項、爲上海陳榮棠之女子擲鐵餅、錢行素之女子跳欄複賽、及賈連仁男子八百公尺决賽、八百公尺决賽、前三名皆破全國紀錄、尤屬難能可貴、爲昨日大會生色不少、男女田徑三項錦標形勢、上海仍居優先、錦標已無問題、球類比賽男子網球形勢漸緊張、興趣似集中於是項、今日精彩節目爲許承基對徐煒培之單打、</p>
<h3>羣雄聚會八百米　賈連仁創全國新紀錄　時間二分三秒一前三名均新紀錄　李世明第二董叔昭第三競爭至烈</h3>
<p>「群英會一中之八百公尺次賽、給予觀衆以極大之興奮、並爲大會作成光榮之紀念、上海賈連仁夙懷大志、果然得展所長、以輕快之脚步、作成二分三秒一之全國新紀錄、衆望所歸之李世明董叔昭、屈居第二第三、但其成績、前者爲二分四秒、後者爲二分四秒一、亦均全國新紀錄也、是賽於昨日繼女子百公尺預賽後舉行檢聲響時、互不甘後、如跑二百公尺然、努力奮前其時以亞軍李世明居先、四圍掌聲鼎沸、因事前都以冠軍當屬李、萬頭　動、齊聲呌彩、斯時冠軍賈連仁居第三位、董叔昭緊跟李世明、不肯放鬆一步、待跑至四百公尺時、賈連仁漸進至第二位、僅離李君四米餘、待至最後轉灣、賈以全力猛然衝刺、董叔眧加力追趕、當此時際、全塲空氣熱烈、情緒緊張、時李已退居第三、賈連仁突出前茅、時離終點僅十餘米、李君鼓氣捨命狂追、以一綫之苦、獲得亞軍、而以二分三秒一到終點、賈董僅落後一步、前三名均創新紀錄、成績列於左、</p>
<p>（一）賈連仁（滬）……二分三秒一　（四）邱忠澄（滬）</p>

<h3>男子跳遠决賽　葉遂安獲冠軍　張嘉夔退落第三王季淮第二　成績七公尺七六未逹其頂點</h3>
<p>男子跳遠决賽、張嘉夔本有七公尺〇九之成績、而葉遂安在馬華預選之成績爲七公尺正、故賽前二君之呼聲最高、參加决賽者、共五十餘人、第一週試跳時、上海王季淮、以六公尺六〇五、領導在先、其餘諸子、無過六公尺五十者、旣　二跳、葉遂安得六公尺七六一、此時之張　夔尙一蹶不振、三次試跳完畢、得决賽權者、爲葉遂安·王季淮·王禾·張　夔·于淸榮·王鴻錦等六人、王禾于第四跳得六公尺五一九、張嘉夔於第五跳始得六公尺五四、參加决賽之六人、均無特殊成績、令人大失所望、而跑道之　軟、不無影響、各賽員之姿勢、亦均未合標準、如張嘉夔之奔跑呆梗、王季淮之跳躍高度、亦遠遜往年、葉遂安之’奔跑速度亦稍　、王禾之空中動作、尚須用力、定有優良成績出顯、茲記前六名之成績如次、</p>
<p>（一）葉遂安　（馬華）　六公尺七六</p>
<p>（二）　王季淮　（上海）　六公尺六〇五</p>

<h3>劉長春　放棄二百公尺　將致力於兩項接力　遼寗全能呼聲頗高</h3>
<p>記者昨晤長春君、訽其二百公尺棄權之原因、據劉君談、前日之百公尺决賽、因用力渦度、疲勞未復、故昨日之二百公尺决賽、乃决定放棄、劉君又謂此次遼寗於全能錦標、頗有厚望、郭潔之五項運動、頗有把握、恐非郝王之敵手、而周長星之十項、亦爲張齡佳之勁敵、或有勝張之可能、若於四百公尺接力及千六百公尺接力、各得亞軍分數、則可獲全能錦標、故劉君將在二項接力賽中、再展身手、末據劉君謂、譚福禎因病不克參加兩欄競賽、殊爲可惜、</p>

<h3>昨日女子田徑　又創兩項全國紀錄　鐵餅陳榮棠造三〇公尺〇五五　跳欄複賽錢行素費時十四秒三</h3>
<p>昨日之女　餅决賽、頗爲大會生色、陳榮棠之奪得冠軍、早爲本報預測所及者、陳女士前日曾得鉛球冠軍、以未破全國紀錄爲憾事、昨日之鐵餅决賽、早即按定打破全國紀錄之决心、競賽開始後、陳即先聲奪人、舉手一擲、超二十七公尺、於第一擲時、即得三十公尺〇五五之成績、已破馬驥保持之二八公尺六六之全國紀錄、第二名爲上海之陳淑芳、亦達二十八公尺一〇、亦接近全國紀錄、第三爲上海丁桂梅、第四爲福建之許梅英、第五爲河北之胡文蘭、第六爲馬華之陳金鑲、成績較第一名均尙美甚遠、茲記全部成績如下、</p>
<p>（一）陳榮棠（上海）　三〇公尺〇五五（新）</p>
<p>（二）陳淑芳（上海）　二八公尺一〇</p>
<p>（三）丁桂梅（上海）　二四公尺八九</p>

<p>（五）胡文蘭（河北）　二三公尺八九五</p>
<p>（六）陳金鑲（馬華）　二三公尺七三</p>
<p>昨日徑賽初複中、因劉長春之放棄二百公尺、興趣稍減、高欄陶英傑林紹洲雖各有十六秒四之成績、但亦不見精彩、惟有女子八十米跳欄複賽、又得一新收穫、錢行素以十四秒三、創一全國新紀錄、可謂生色不少、錢出塲時已爲觀衆所注目、起步過欄、均老練非凡、造詣甚深、三步一欄、從無參差不齊之弊、馬華徐鳳英女士亦係健者、與錢競爭甚烈、但卒非其敵、</p>

<h3>今日决賽預測　女子徑賽競爭必烈</h3>
<p>男子標槍</p>
<p>男千標槍决賽、定有可觀、爲今日精彩節目之一、北平有大將彭水馨、而上海有郝春德、唐質粉王學武、遼寗有周長星、郭潔、冠軍當屬於老將彭永馨、彭爲標槍紀錄之維持者、除上列諸健將之外、張齡佳、李世銘、趙啟明等成績、亦不弱、</p>
<p>女子跳高</p>
<p>女于跳高、冠軍將屬於福建之陳翠芳、或北平之李賢英、因二人過去之成績、均曾平等全國紀錄、但女子跳高之成績、都相差無幾、屆時或出冷門、他如上海之戎淑貞、馬華之葛玉蓮、北平之方絪、上海之朱天真、河北之王淑貞、均有入選希望、</p>
<p>男子高欄</p>
<p>冠軍當屬林紹洲、但其勁敵有柳英俊與黃英俊、但高欄比賽、恒有不測風雲、一受意外、恒易失敗、昨日陳嘉佑之倒欄落選、即其例也、又如李厚逹、楊木和、李錦泉、朱文極、均有入選希望、成績當在十六秒一至十六秒三四、</p>
<p>男子二百米</p>
<p>男子二百公尺决賽、劉長　旣不參加、冠軍將屬於傳金城、毫無疑問、惟成績方面、恐難有何特殊者、其餘名次、尙難逆料、</p>
<p>女子跳欄</p>
<p>女子跳欄、爲錢行素之囊中物、勝來極易、昨日錢以十四秒三、打破全國紀錄、惟尙不及其在夏令營中所創之十三秒三、今日决賽、不知能否突破十四秒關、其餘名次、尙待角遂後分明、</p>
<p>女子百公尺</p>
<p>女子百公尺决賽、將爲焦玉蓮·鄧銀嬌·李森·錢行素·陳鏗五人之爭覇、以實力論、李森頗有厚望、惟視鄧銀嬌過去之成績、似有獲勝之可能、焦玉蓮則爲全國紀錄之保持者、亦爲個中之俊佼者、</p>

<h3>綱球興趣漸濃　許氏昆仲大顯身手　雙打六比一及七比五勝香港何　昨男女單打共十六塲熱鬧非凡</h3>
<p>男子網球、昨日共賽單打八組、雙打四組、各地名將、全體登塲、故戰情緊張非常、允以滬林賽華對鄂羅光圭之單打、及爪哇許承基承位昆仲對香港徐煒培何家鎏之雙打、更爲精彩、吸收觀衆不下千人、後至幾無立足地、爲本屆大會之弟一次盛况、每當表演精彩時掌聲如當，響淸雲霄，情緒熱烈精神興　、當爪哇與杳港雙打賽時、吳市長亦蒞塲觀戰、見有精彩處、頻點其首、表示滿意、各組戰績如左、</p>
<h3>單打比賽八組　川京滬粵獲全勝　競爭興趣漸濃厚</h3>
<p>上午單打　形勢一</p>
<p>川浙京閩四組單打、於上午九時開戰、以王夕正擊法老練、出球犀利、對方浙戴廣球藝平平、遠非其敵、王手下留情、未用全力、偶或顯本領、戴即無從反抗、只能頻頻搖頭、甘拜下風、川錢志彬未見進步、與浙郭彭年　校所　微幾、郭以柔制剛錢雖使足勁道、仍無大效、劇戰兩盤、錢始於筋疲力盡之狀態下、獲得勝利、京馬少伯與閩杯全恩、實力平均、難分軒輊、競爭至爲劇烈、三盤結束、均　疲憊、京李不祖對閩洪雲暉之戰、終塲最早、李技尙可取、洪藝甚幼組、形勢懸殊、成一面倒之局勢、</p>
<p>林君寶華　牛刀小試</p>
<p>午後一時、亦有單打四組、滬林寶華對鄂羅光圭、第一盤林大刀闊斧、連下四　、羅一再努力、免吃鴨蛋、林再加局、隊以六比一勝、第二判林鋒芒仍健、憑其銳利之對角抽及、巧妙之切球、又以六興三六比、奏凱而歸、羅竭力抵抗、始終不懈、渾身解數、施展無遺、居然顯還顏色、奪得數局、昨雖受挫、雖敗猶榮、</p>
<p>邱君飛海　抽來抽去</p>
<p>滬邱飛海恃其底線長抽、輕取鄂吳國霖、吳半路　家、與邱對敵能於兩盤中　得一局、亦屬不易、粵黎　　爲網球宿將、袖　峻急贛毛康侯初出茅　、自非敵手、兩盤　東、毛未奪得一局、粵徐潤培爲港徐煒　介弟、家學淵源、非同”嚮、贛李雲岩藝甚可觀、第一盤競爭劇烈、徐以七比五勝、第二盤　蒿志報復、連下三局、大有收復失地之勢、惜長力不足、被徐織破弱點、利用聲樂擊西法、使李疲於奔命、結果李又以四比六失第一盤、各成績如下</p>
<p>王文正（川）六—二　勝戴廣進（浙）</p>
<p>王文正（川）六—一　勝戴廣進（浙）</p>

<h3>興趣集中雙打　許氏昆仲大破香港徐何　表演精彩百出堪嘆觀止</h3>

<p>情緒熱烈　　以描寫</p>
<p>全塲注目之爪港雙打、於四時許方始開賽、聞風而來觀戰　、接踵而至、環視四周、坐無隙地、後至者竟無立錐之地、幸維持得法、秩序尙佳、啟賽後、全塲空氣緊張、觀衆情緒之熟烈、得未曾見、鼓　聲、驚嘆聲、不絕於耳、每至精彩處、各個面部表情、雖請千萬畫師、亦　以描　盡　、至於各個心即、更一言難盡、或則以爲三許球藝超羣、威名遠震、必勝無　、或則以爲港隊原係健將、冷鬥獨出、亦屬可能、究竟如何、戰後分嘵、</p>
<p>許氏昆仲　司稱奇才</p>
<p>許承基於上屆全運會中、一　　人、引起全國　　　、自今年參加台杯賽後、更突飛猛進、一日千里、同　國內、無其四敵、砲彈式之發球、電霆萬鈞之　　、以及正反抽擊、無一不佳、每擊一球、必使觀眾稱奇嘆絕、乃第承位、擊法如老兄、高壓亦甚出色、惟初臨大敵、略規慌張、因之　欠把握耳、徐煒培奮勇力戰、表演特佳、發球銳利、抽壓均佳、人以反手更為出色、奔跑亦甚迅速、昨戰最爲賣力、何家鎏本爲雙打好手、老將威風、不改當年、大敵當前、勇氣百倍、出球　　有加、不愧名將風度也、</p>
<p>徐何苦戰　　　敗北</p>
<p>四時許、雙方戎裝　見、觀衆報以當聲、球證、聲宣戰、劇　就此開始、港徐煒培發球、告聲奪人、取得一屆、後二許鋒芒畢露、壓殺抽截、數路進攻、徐何六顯本領、鎭靜應戰、但究竟二許棋高一着、一氣呵成六局、以六比一奪得第一盤、第二盤起徐何小心翼翼、不敢魯莽、二許亦穩定對付、毫不放鬆、先各失發球局、而成各三平手、徐何一路領前繼徐何連加二局、以五比三佔優、是時衆料徐何或能扳回一盤、再有第三盤可飽眼福、何如下局、承基發球、滑四全勝、煒培發　失利、竟造成各五和局、下局又為二許獲得、反以六比五超前、於是競爭更見劇烈、平等者逹五次之多、終被二許連得四局、而反以七比力歸許氏昆伸勝利、四塲雙結　如下、</p>

<p>四川對蒙古之戰、爲昨日籃球之開　戲、上午九時、裁判員徐汝康、發出號令、戰雲　起、兩隊均屬平庯之材、戰來毫無精彩、蒙古軍爲首都蒙藏學校之一部份學員拼台成軍、戰時各自爲政、每　單獨拍球、前進不事傳遞、四川隊則精知合作、故能稍佔便宜、蒙軍首先獲得四分、後四川隨即平等之、復以十比六領前、此後川軍一路佔先、上半時廿六對—一獲勝、下半時中、蒙古隊一度掙扎、榮鈕二鋒、連中數球、比數漸邊接近、然如曇花一現、由衛張華奇兵暗襲、迭陷敵籃而歸、蒙軍逐蹶不振、以卅對五十七敗北、雙方陣綫列　、</p>

<h3>粵浙兩路告捷　青島山東同遭屈服　馬來上海今有劇戰</h3>
<p>昨日女子籃球初戰、共有兩場、上午十時、廣東對青島、粵軍犀利非凡、結果以四十四對二十五、輕取青島、浙魯之戰、於昨下午三時舉行、浙軍賴最後之努力、淘汰山東、今日共有兩場、湖北對河北、上午八時、上海對馬來亞、下午三時、預料滬馬之戰、將有相當精彩、然恐馬來女郎、終非滬軍之敵手也、</p>
<h3>廣東凱旋　青島小姐失風　四四比念五</h3>
<p>廣東與青島女子籃球初戰、繼蒙川男子戰後而起、慕名而來觀戰者、絡繹不絕、體育館人數驟倍、增數內中尤多兩廣健兒、及山東老鄉、</p>
<p>南國女兒　之技術、早已有口皆碑、上屆出席全運之容羨紅饒惠芬等、英勇猶昔、再眆以滬上　將劉瑪琍陳瑞屏、益覺如虎之　翼、鋒衛合作功夫尚佳、前鋒尤為犀利、容女士矯健非凡、實係可畏人材、青島球亦不大差、惜過棋高一着之粵軍，不免有點縛手縛脚、栽判舒鴻、吹動銀笛、球場</p>
<p>空氣一變　球遠由沉悶而入興奮、青島後衛犯規、舒裁判執法如山、容羨紅　舒粉臂、首中一分、繼復得陳瑞屏遠傳、又進一隻、青島紀中鋒、不甘落後、還敬一球、分數平均遞增、首節廣東小勝、此後競爭形勢吃緊非常、雙方嚴密看守、一再停戰計議、上半時終了、廣東僅以二十一對十五稍已領前、休息片刻後廣東軍</p>
<p>大打其氣　眾球員精神一振、容女士罰球準確、得分不少、青島姑娘犯規纍纍心驚膽戰、球勢遂急轉直下、第三節廉東又增十一分、青軍見時間將終、蓄志恢復失地、奈後衛力薄難支、得不償失、胡笳長鳴、時間終了、粵隊遂將青島淘汰、</p>

<h3>浙江告勝　山東姑娘敗北　念一比九分</h3>
<p>昨日之籃球壓軸戲、為浙江女子對山東、下午三時舉行、裁判員為江良規、兩軍球藝均屬平平、南方姑娘、多善詭計、北國小姐、不如變化、於上半時中尚能分庭抗禮、下半時浙隊戰略變更、以一人看住一人、專以一人投籃　老鄉大吃其虧賜金關戰後、浙江密斯朱首中籃圈、山東投桃報李、各不　讓雙方看守稽嚴、投籃機會極少、上半時浙江八分、山東六分、沉寂片刻、烽烟再起、山東秦哲自拉自唱、加上二分、繼復罰進一分、再以一分超前、西湖小姐急　停戰、當場舉行六人軍事會議、交頭接耳、鬼鬼祟祟，果然不虛此停、朱蘭生酈清雙雙進　、周小姐專司把風魯軍手脚慌張遂成不治之症、結果二十一對九浙軍得最後之勝利、</p>

<h3>昨日足球粵鄂京三路告捷　粵魯與鄂贛為一面　倒京豫之戰競爭頗劇烈</h3>
<p>昨日足球次賽三場、上午〇八時、湖北戰江西、鄂隊以十三比零　全勝、十時廣東與山東、繼續作戰、結果齊魯好漢竟以零對九、全軍覆敗、下午四時、南京戰河南、兩隊勢均力敵、上半時鷄子對鴨蛋、未分勝負、下半時南京接連攻陷河南二城、以二對零、鳴金收兵、隊戰况、略述於下、</p>
<h3>湖北全勝江西　十三對零毫不費力</h3>
<p>湖北隊前鋒如江潮、符質彬·鄧志揚輩僥勇善戰、內衛綫亦四平八　、頗有朝氣、反顧贛軍陣綫散漫、守衛薄弱、甫經接觸、勝負立判、祗見鄂方五鋒盤旋贛境、　彈絕少軼出中綫以外、贛軍一時陷於苦　、　衝右突、迄未能闖出重園、上半時六對零、鄂勝、</p>
<p>下半時易地重戰、形勢依然、贛隊度振作、始終未有建樹、士卒沮喪、無心戀戰、贛軍勢如破竹、一　攻奪、如入無人之境、結果又獲七球、總分十三對零、雙方陣勢如下、</p>

<h3>廣東力服山東　齊魯好漢一籌莫展</h3>
<p>廣東隊遐邇聞名、齊魯好漢雖多能征慣戰之上、但首　即　勁敵、小心翼翼、拚命抵抗、雖終以零對九覆敗、強弱懸殊、非戰之罪也、</p>
<p>頭上功夫</p>
<p>上午十時、銀備聲中、戰　展開、南國健兒飛陷魯陣、五鋒以迅速神妙之　終、直搗黃龍、未三分鐘、粵右內鋒譚江柏獲球、運用頭上功夫、頂球入網、魯守門員以為飛將軍自天而下、措手不及、廣東啦啦隊歡呼聲中、首開紀錄、齊魯大漢不甘示弱、全線動員進攻、球攻粵門、有數次極好射門機會、終以大漢脚頭欠準、出界越網、不一而足、未幾粵軍乘勢還攻、先後獲得三球、上半時以四對零告一段路、是場也、魯軍應戰、異常劇烈、粵方雖勝殊感吃力、</p>
<p>全軍瓦解</p>
<p>下半時、粵軍進攻益急、加以魯軍守門心慌意亂、錯悮頻見、連失各城、大勢已去、全軍陣線動搖、冰消瓦解、粵隊獲球如探囊取物、又造成五對零紀錄、總分九對零、魯軍敗北、兩隊陣綫如下、</p>

<h3>南京倖勝河南　鏖戰半場未分勝負　下半場京凈勝二球</h3>
<p>昨日下午四時、南京對河南之足球戰、雙方旗鼓相當、表演　見精彩、上半場均無紀錄、未分勝負、下半場京隊王宣權奮勇攻獲一球、最後十分鐘時、豫軍後衛救球犯規、　山陸東海踢中一球、兩隊球藝半斤八兩、未分軒輊、京隊猶勝半山球運也、</p>
<p>未分勝負</p>
<p>球證鳴笛，比賽開始、京隊左　楊　偉傳中、雖迫得角球一次、然未克奏功、其後何學泉主踢罰球、又連獲二次角球、均未得手、反為豫左翼吳書雲沿邊進襲、幸京門穩固終告無恙、其後混戰　十分鐘、陸東海三十碼外遠射、亦未告捷、鏖戰十五分鐘、雙方均未能打開紀錄、將完場時、陸東海二次射門、經守門鄒國安迎接、及後衛搶救、仍告無恙、結果零比零、上半場勝負未分、</p>
<p>京隊告捷</p>
<p>開始後、京隊守衛人員送次犯規、門前頓呈險象、然豫隊前鋒脚頭欠準、未奏膚功、五分鐘後、京隊又告活躍、陸東海射門越野後、張鴻藻繼作中路傳球、鄒國安棄門搶球、已來不及、王宣權連人帶球、衝入網內、首開紀錄、再戰後、張鴻萍楊人偉相繼射門、均失之操切、未能建樹、邱繼賢邊防起義、眼看球將入門、　終為鄒國安救出、豫隊諸將以時間將完、又大舉反攻、然因脚頭無靈、終難雪恥、未幾陸東海乘罰十二碼球之　、再將球兒送進網窩、二比零、南京隊勝、雙隊陳勢如下、</p>

<h3>男子排球初賽　香港輕取河南　直落三相形見絀</h3>
<p>排球初賽、昨日輪至香港河南對場、香港排球、本屬家園名菜、輕車熟道、毫不易事、河南不經大嚼、自然相形見絀、結果直落三香港遂於巧取豪奪之下、得次賽　、成績如下、</p>
<p>香港　廿一比四　廿一比十　廿一比十三　河南</p>
<p>第一局　下午一時、兩隊於譚天沛指揮之下、蒞場開火、占卜地位既竣、河南　純止首開紀錄、但一響頭爆仗、究竟勿靈、經不起香港惱羞成怒、李沃林前呼後應、霎時大花臉上場一鼓作氣、　下重　、記分員忙於登賬、一串聯珠、竟造成—與一比之一面倒之局面，香港以勝六不武、勉強情讓二分、上半時以十一對二換場、掉過場地、依然如此、幸河南藉香港大意之機會、罰得二分、終局為四比廿一香港勝、</p>
<p>第二局　第二局、豫軍稍變陣容滿望失之　隅、收之桑榆、故上場片刻、精神然極可觀、惟實力相去、總屬太遠、隊長劉永祥雖持其身長力大、怎奈關門無術後、排人選、更以險球過多、救不勝救、而一概置之大命、於是進不足言攻、退不足以守、眼高手低、坐觀割地讓城、是局勝利、仍必香港、比數　廿一比十、</p>
<p>第三局　第三局上場、老戲新串、惟香港方面不免因驕　敵、故成進退對等之勢、四對四後、始見香港發很、大張撻伐、火力之猛、密如砲彈、河南祇有招架、除香港若干自殺外、上半局得分甚少、下半場起雖有扳搏、但差比太多、仍以十三比廿一、香港軍殺得全軍覆沒、陣綫如下</p>
<p>香港陣綫　周永梅　鍾華超　膚白寗　李振安　李沃林　馬登堂　伍灼　　許子俊　何炳基</p>

<h3>舊都勝新都　北平淘汰南京　直落三寫寫意意</h3>
<p>南京與北平之戰於下午三時舉行、雙方先時出場操繞、南北嬌女、充滿英雄氣概、血戰結果、北平以三對〇大獲全勝、</p>
<p>北平　二一此一三　二一比九　二一比一三　南京</p>
<p>終點裁判目臺（葉長烈攝）</p>
<p>一瀉千里</p>
<p>北平姑娘、嬌艷如花、而健美遠勝於南京小姐、開手之初、雙方實力、似見平稔、南京前排之黃薔英、北平中排之方紀、皆為此中全材、北平前球、略見得分、南京還他顏色、手術亦輕清可喜四座觀眾、為之出神、上半時十二對五、換場之後、北地胭脂脫盡女兒身份、中後　排、撲地救出險球至多、沈崇寄之傳遞、李寶紀之劈殺、燕曉芬之閂門、皆有可取、南京依黃薔英為柱石、以一人當關、非具萬夫之勇、曷克當此重任、於是一瀉千里、以二十一對十二終場、北平光聲奪人、</p>
<p>氣壯山河</p>
<p>第二局雙方稍增生力軍、再看廝段、北平方面、壁上觀者捧場有人、故氣壯山河，居然一帆風順、沈崇寄揚臂發球、一索得男、再來一個又是連中三斤、博得滿場釆聲，吱吱怪呌、盛况為排球塢之最高紀錄、南京鬧得必慌、動多坐失良機、偶有收獲、亦不過什一之得、於事無濟，二局以二十一比五終北平勝、南京小姐懊喪異常、</p>
<p>大勢已去</p>
<p>排球賽比賽方法、採五賽三勝淘汰制、故　三局為南京所必爭、方備首先發球、臂力不濟、兩次出淺，氣勢已非、指員急授應變和策、生機頓現、但以五十步與百步之進步相較、終猶相差一　、故上半時僅十比十一一分之差、而後半場竟大有差別、南京雖欲挽回危局、而於—　十四比時、竟連為北平擊落四分、於是大勢已去、南京惟有再事修養、靜候報復之機會而已、比數為二十一對十三、北平勝、</p>
<p>可造之才</p>
<p>總觀雙方球藝、北平頗具平均發展之妙、燕曉芬之劈殺、確為不可多得之良材、至其高躍低壓、尤使對方不可救藥、得分之多、此君造就不少、南京黃薔英，亦有相當可取、惟中綫太感散漫、而球來時不能鎮靜處之、動以全軍抵抗、故偶為敵方稍出奇兵、即行不救、將來在鍛練方面、似應加以相當之注意也、</p>
<p>北平陣綫　李宗紀　燕曉芬　哈慶慈　沈崇寄　方紀　王倓　范亞維　龔　賢　何春瑾</p>
<p>南京陣綫　祟之端　黃薔英　周載芬　方備　周多福　朱月珊　黃淑賢　呂迺英　郭霞</p>

<h3>向下屆全運大會籌委會建議　陳奎生</h3>
<p>一國舉辦全運大會、其目的有二、一在質的提高（注意新成績的創造）、一在量的普及、一、者原應並重、不宜有所偏倚、但就我國目前情勢而論、其質似不見甚高、此將我國最高紀錄與世界成績比較相差遠甚一點觀之、可以證明、推究其　結之所在、仍在量的普及之功夫、尙未逹到理想之境地也、本來就普及將育之工作言、首須植基於小學體育、次則須極力提倡民衆體育、此經騐之譚、不可磨滅成之論也、頗欲賴小學體育普及而提高成績、此係期之永久百年大計之策、源遠流長、劉收急效、若欲賴民衆體育提高成績、則覺現在一般民眾對於體育、既無基礎、亦無興趣、何有成續之可言、至公務員中曾係大學出身、而現在仍能努力繼續不斷的練習以爲之倡者、則實有及百千萬分之一、少乎其不可計數、故為顧及質興量兩方面工作、雙管齋下、而能收目前之急效、樹永久之基礎者、則惟有在下屆全運會中、修改競賽規程、增加男子中等組、以資救濟、仍將現制保留、命爲公開組、其原則以不增加大會及各單位時日、勞力與經費之多消耗爲　準、而確能收到質的提高與量的普及兩力面之功效、茲略舉简單辦法如下、請向下屆大會籌委會建議、並徵求各單位饗應、發表意見、公開討論、母任企盼、</p>
<p>（一）男子中等組、規定身體重之限制、一項超過規定者、即爲公開組、其年齡學業、約相當於八歲之高中學生（自然不以學生爲限、此所提者、爲身長體重規定之標準限制耳、）各單位報名時、須填載選手之身長體重（單位採市尺市斤）報到時、由大會派專員覆查或捕查、女子體育成績、就過經騐言、中學生之質與量、均勝過大學生、故不必分組、</p>
<p>（二）男子田徑賽、全能及游泳、原定每項可報四人、茲旣分公開與中等兩組、則每組每項祇許報一人、報名人數不增、而因分組關係、可予靑年運動員以充當選手之機會、增加比　經騐、往例、各單位於每項雖報四人、其實四人之成績、僅一二名校勝、其餘有相差遠甚者、若改此辦法、中等組成績略勝者、亦有參加比賽之機會、而大會於比賽時　分為兩組、但因公開組人數減少、一率之故、亦不多增比賽時間、其裁判、勞力、經費、亦因而多增加與多消耗也、</p>
<p>（三）球類男子分組、較　困難、如一律分為兩組、則於大會及各單位、均增加一倍之消耗、此爲不可能之事、如不分組、則與建議之原旨相違、此中實難得有至善之方法也、惟查內地、省分、有者僅一省立大學、因缺少比賽機會、成績凡席、無足稱述、有者並一省立大學而無之、至中等學校、則普通省分、大都較爲發逹、由此推想、各單位自度公開組成績遜色而中等成績較勝者、必祇報中等組而異公開組、就全國各地球類成績而論、除南京·北平·河北（包有天津雄厚勢力）·上海外、其特殊者僅閩奧港之足排球故球類公開組之隊數必然减少、不至使大會增加一倍之勞苦與消耗也、或由大會規定限制、兩組祇許各單位隨意加入組、一此推想、內地省分、必然願意加入中等組者多、而京平滬各地、必然願意加人公開組、此制之缺點、即加入公開組各地之中等紙、無機會加入全運、似乎不平、但若能由全國最高體育行政機關於相當時期、主持全國各區中等組球類分區比賽、亦　補救之一法、又若我國建設進步迅速、各省交通發逹，最高體育行政機關、能在不舉行全運之年度中、主持全國男子中等祖球類比賽、以資則在全運中男子球類不分組亦可、總之、關於球類比賽之應否分組、分組有何至善之方法而不增加大會與各單位之困難、個人尙無妥善之計劃、以資貢獻、惟此建議、實本善意請視為一種個人提示之初步意見、究竟有否必委、是否適富、尙祈各單位高明之士指教爲幸、</p>

<h3>健兒訪問記　鄭銀嬌運動小史</h3>
<p>馬來亞女田　選手鄧　　女士、在此次全運會中、以五公尺零六之　績、　子跳　　國　紀錄、在五　公尺內、亦獲得　四、尙有百公尺一項、今日亦將與李森焦王　　錢行　名將一决勝負、我滬上人士、對鄧女士之成績、固早已有良好之印象、上海社記者、昨晤女士於遝動塲中、余初以方言不通、談話恐發生困難爲　熟知鄧小姐說得一口流利的國語、不僅是她馬來亞選手中大半都　得很好的國語、女士眼似近視、故常帶眼鏡、貌雖非嬌　、膚　非銀色、然尙健美可愛、女士年方二九、生於暹邏、久住檳城、畢業　馬來亞福建女子中學校、文學是其特長、現任敎於檳城　　學校、家有母哥弟妺四人、對於運動、據云尙係今年才開始練習、在第三屆馬來亞華僑運動會中、獲五十公尺·百公尺·二百公尺·跳遠四項冠軍、且　遠以五公尺一二五打破全國紀錄、此此僅在全運會前一個月中、加以相當之訓紗、目前因水土不服、身體欠適、故成績已退步矣、惟以未經長期練習、而有如此成績、誠屬不可多得、以女士之天才、前途實未可限量也、</p>
<h3>葉遂安之私生活</h3>
<p>昨日獲男子跳遠冠軍之馬來亞選手葉遂安、其姿勢美妙、頗　觀衆賞識、記者富其領獎出塲時、擬與談話、誰知一轉瞬間遍　不獲、乃趨往兩江宿舍中、亦未晤面、當遇該隊管理黃霜仁君、黃與葉君爲同事、故對其情況知之頗詳、承告如下、葉君今年二十三歲馬來亞檳城吉隆坡人、畢業於鍾靈中學、現在母校服務、家中父母均已故　、　有弟一人亦在鍾靈讀書、葉君對各項運動俱喜練習、此次參加標槍跳遠、其標槍成績、在馬曾得四十八公尺、跳遠亦逹七公尺餘、且隨便　來、不費氣力、此次亦因身體受水土不服影響、致成紱退步、葉君任校天資聰頴、各種功課俱列前茅、爲人亦和　可親、實爲頗可造就之人才、惟因家庭環境不伴、故不能逹升學目的、此次尙係初次返國云、</p>
<h3>會塲速寫</h3>
<p>不是寃家不聚首　李森鄧銀嬌兩小姐、前日在跳逮中一個得第一、一個得第二、在五十公尺一個得弟一、一個得第四、昨日百公尺預賽、兩位小姐又掽在一起、眞是不是寃家不聚首、</p>
<p>看臺風勢將轉移　運動塲中的看臺、一元以上的座位在東西司令臺左右、地位適中、左盼右顧、在在相宜、惟八角以下尤以兩角爲甚、在南北兩極、僅可看到塲之一角、連日北邊因有國術比賽、故觀衆摔擠、南邊則冷淸淸地沒有幾個人、今天譚美觀之足踏車表演、在南邊舉行、想必風勢定有轉移矣、</p>
<p>誤傳由東吃麥東　昨日上午有一塲足球比賽、是山東對廣東、報告員在報告時、適因揚聲機出毛病、聲音不淸、觀眾聽了好像說山東吃麥東、</p>
<p>馬來選手多塞鼻　馬來亞選手均係牛長熱帶、初次北來、頗感水土不服、昨據該隊某職員稱、馬來選手到此後、都患一種鼻、　　地交關　過、</p>
<p>江浙小姐電話冬　大會會塲外、沒有公共電話數具、在內打電話的選至于、以江蘇浙江上海的小姐們最多、昨天某小姐在打電話時、急將門緊緊閉上、其同伴將門拉開、急得某小姐而組耳赤、</p>
<p>粵女初奏啦啦歌　三日來各項球類比賽、啦啦隊昨日在藍球房中初次出現、係廣東對青島女籃球賽時、許多廣東小姐在塲助威、大奏啦啦歌、一時充满悅耳之聲、</p>
<p>球衣反穿號奇　吉林省藍球隊之球衣比衆不同、爲　綫之泳衣式、乳旁空着一　、中釘號布、裏　白式背心、上綴吉林一一字適於洞中　出、可謂別緻、昨某球員匆忙之間、將球反穿、號碼奇突、不能認識、衆皆忍笑不止、</p>

<h3>紗花　外棉日疲　棉紗賣風又盛</h3>
<p>穩　數日之紗市、今則顯著疲倦無勁之象、市態略爲軟化、良以海外棉業情形日見疲乏、且歐　戰雲消澹、人心未免帶弱、而上日盛傳膨脤事件、全屬捕風捉影之談、市價乃步步下墮矣、惟倉庫中存紗量至最近止、令剩四千三百包左存、比上月底之數咸少一半矣、</p>
<p>金鷄跌一元外</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月一致下落、因美棉續下六至十磅音、兼了上口通貨之謠均屬空談、塲中　動、買方雖有一度抵抗、二三盤徵見回升數角、迨至收盤、聞標金平平各月跌四·五·六·角、結果各月比上日收盤　均跌四·六·八，角、午後開盤尙平庯、拍至二三盤、仍在二三角中出入、但拍至收盤、　面不振、以大阪三品紗　跌、下過市面看小、賣風稍盛、合興長長信誠三戶賣出獨旺、結果各月比上午收盤價又跌四·六·七·角、查賣出合興一千三百包、泰興六百包、長豐一千九百包、潤康一千七百五十包、信誠一千二百包、逹記七百五十包、永大四百包、買進大孚六百包、同孚四百包、錦昌五百包長餘五百五十包、慎記一千一百五十包、仁豐六百五十包、源大五百包、振大四百五十包、恒昌四百五十包、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<p>長和長豐了結多頭</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、因海外美棉續跌十磅音、印棉亦跌〇二五至一羅比、而標金市倒平定、人心軟弱、買戶缺乏、市象暗澹、塲內　易　感星稀、結果各月比上日收盤價跌五分至一角、午　開盤尙平、拍至二盤以後、轉入　境、因大　三品棉花跌一角至六角半、外棉仍屬看跌、人氣較鬆、長和長豐多頭賣出了結、結果各月比上午收盤價跌一角至一角半、惟本月漲一角、查賣出大孚三千一百擔、長和二千九百擔、長豐二千九百擔、潤康一千五百擔、益康一千擔、愼記八白擔、信誠九百擔、協成六百擔、買進振大一千百擔、源大九百擔、大豐一千擔、裕大　百擔、大　百擔、元一一千八百擔、新亭二千二百擔擔、愼昌二千五百擔、源興昌二千擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價列下、</p>

<h3>美棉套賣增加</h3>
<p>昨美棉開盤、各月漲一至四磅音、交易呆滯、價因同業限價買進及利物沛帮買進而堅、旋以業外買戶缺乏、套賣增加而疲、天氣順利、溫度較高、寒霜未降、現需活動、脚地堅定、紡織品平靜、產銷相等、海斯德氏估計本過廠用爲一六〇、〇〇〇包、利物浦存底爲一二一、〇〇〇包、收盤平疲、計現貨跌十磅音、期貨跌六至十一磅音、英棉現貨漲三點、期貨漲一二點、印棉多方操業者買進散戶多頭了結、後因利物浦消息良好而堅、計平果爾及奧姆辣漲·〇二五羅比、白羅溪漲一羅比、原電錄左、（十一日電）</p>

<h3>糧食　浮多稍有出籠　粉麥近遠步小</h3>
<p>粉市已　和緩、因洋麥報價、芝加哥一角零、坎拿大小二角左右、市塲人心、因洋麥微跌、且自市面良好以來、實銷迄無大批活動、故投機多頭、未免均見觀望、所以交易不旺、市氣略軟、迨至下午開盤、傳國內治安、又生無　之謠、致買氣愈寂、市步平疲、下午交易、亦祇做二十萬包左右、較之日前之熱鬧情形、大有天淵之別、</p>

<p>麥市鬧盤后、各月份達致平定、音洋麥報價、微落一二角不等、一般頭機價買戶、因値週六、風險頗大、故交易均淸、一部分之浮多、頗有脫手、近遠各期、遂小去一二分不等、此後局面、仍看國外情形爲轉移、現麥仍見穩定、見交數量、則逹八千包、因貨品高次不一、全數均由福新配去、其餘各廠、均不問訊、開山東麥四元四角、江北麥四元三角八分、紹興麥四元一角六分云、</p>

<h3>陰變元供不敷求</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨日各帮來源仍到有四十餘號、（貨共八千餘石）、銷塲因天氣轉陰、本街店胃續有動動、惟包胃烟台幫祇辦陳新兩貨共三四百包、故大局形勢難以見秀、若各厚破及薄破行情悉無榮辱、且其包胃去者猶小二角耳、　　百哥等新簿稻及厚新粳天陰之際、亦無軒輊、杜尖脚地旣堅、去路亦易，故價獨升一角、而洋尖相隨帶起數分、陰　元新陳貨昨忽供不敷求、價　漲一二角不等、</p>
<p>十一日　十二日　上落</p>
<p>泗涇破包一〇·九〇一〇·七〇漲二角</p>
<p>蘇同羊尖八·八五八·九〇漲五分</p>
<p>蘇同　尖八·九〇九·〇〇漲一角</p>
<p>（滬北）昨日河下各路來源見旺、約五六十號、市上各貨去路平淡、惟洋尖埠尖客尖交易仍旺、白元另化轉平、市形破粳疲數分至一角、新粳價小角外、羊杜尖定立、埠尖客家緊數分、白元定勢、薄稍　種價無榮辱、</p>
<h3>洋客秈本銷活潑</h3>
<p>客秈　昨本街胃口仍香、除囤戶外、實銷亦活、北帮亦略有應酬、惟客秈到頭甚旺、新有　皖湘漢甬紹各地裝到、市面乃居定局、午後本街更濃、甬江湖白米激漲五六分、其他各提二三分、全日開出贛米一百多包、湘漢米四百五十包、安慶二百二十包、紹興一百十五包、甬米一千三白多包、多數爲本街辦去、</p>
<p>洋米　昨日本街去化甚活、尤以小絞米被囤戶與實銷競爭、下午漲起三四分、售開二千多包、西貢米開六百五十包、暹元米一百包、後形均居挺秀、</p>
<h3>芝麻蒃豆外銷頗旺</h3>
<p>雜糧由海外情形、造成良好之局面、但因購買力薄、販運亦微、致市况　秀、前昨怡和績訂進十一十二兩月份交之芝蔴五百噸、價開九元三角及九元五角、行情比校三日前之市漲起半元、市塲中現貨市價更形俏俐、新黃豆亦因油價昂貴、又提升五六分、成交各豆四千餘包、去路以廠家福州內地本街均有問津、新茶豆烟台帮辦　頗宏、南洋亦不弱、故市緊提、昨市成交各種明毛菜茶有一千餘包、</p>
<h3>油市　百桐油漲風漸戢</h3>
<p>白柂油自上週漢市洋莊、每箱漲至八十七元後、足度貨已搜羅一空、故本週內所有交易、盡是不足度之池、格雖云照降、然合到足度貨、恐已在八十七元以上、惟貨已售　、所有均屬零星、不能視爲正市也、現在市塲上陳油已成陳蹟、待新貨、而洋行對於期貨在有意無意之間、所以態度頗極鎮靜、已不若半月前之予取予求也、總因價格太高人心思危、恐將來新油上市時反不及陳油之熱鬧、未可知耳、</p>
<h3>生豆油出十六元關</h3>
<p>豆油及花生油市况繼續向上挺漲、刻已冲出十六元大關、本市人氣依然激昂、昨市生豆油行情再砌二三角、共計做開各種豆油一千二百五十件、各種花生油一千二百件、</p>
<h3>棉籽油近三十五元</h3>
<p>棉籽油因連日受豆油價格飛騰影響、亦突飛猛進、大有不可制止之概、日前淸油雖一度售開十四元五角、因成交數不多、亦祇十幾擔、故不作正市論、昨日本街胃口、又形香脆、廠方有鑒於此、市價頓提至十四元九角五分、成交五百擔</p>
<h3>糖市　國產赤白糖開出五百餘包</h3>
<p>昨日糖市趨勢堅定、公會劃盤二四粗砂現貸呌升五分、爲十七元七角、轉口貨五元七角、未成交、九號荷赤轉口貨KD嘜五元三角、已有做出、本廠綿白無甚變動、振記一號仍十六元八角、餘照退、東白九號SHTM嘜均呌十七元半、轉口貨五元半、未成交、八號呌十七元六元、轉口貨YT嘜呌五元六角、略有成交、國產雜白糖號貨開出五百餘包、較高之白糖爲十　角、十四元六角、高赤糖十三元三角、者照减、　莊靑開過十一元二角、比升一有成交、</p>

<p>（一）前淸光緒三年，香山翠亭村地方，某巨宅被盜破門搶刦，時總理年僅十一歲，正在學堂裏讀書，聽到打門坍墻的聲音，和同學七八人出外看望，其餘的同學都駭得抱頭逃向校門內去了，總理獨兀立不動，注視盜刦的行動，並表示沉思痛恨的樣子，嗣見群盜搬取箱　等物，呼嘯而去，接着巨宅中人的嗟　聲，哭泣聲，和鄉人的問訊聲，紛紛談論，接續而起，總理對那事主說，老先生，爲什麼我們沒有保護的人？事主瞠目不能對，總理又問群衆，爲什麽我們沒有保護的人，你們大家覺得嗎？鄉人亦均搖首不能答。</p>
<p>（二）總理十二歲時，村中（翠亭村）楊家花園，園主兄弟三人，不知爲着何事，被滿淸官兵捕去，捕去時其兄已被打得奄奄一息，園址亦被官兵佔住了，總理放學歸家，路經其地，遇見徬徨道左的園丁，詢知底蘊，以楊家兄弟三人從不干預外事，並未犯法，無辜被官兵捕去，又復佔住其園址，深爲不服，挺身入園，被佩刀的官吏擱阻，總理說：這是楊家花園，他們兄弟，是我家的好朋友，我是來玩，並看望他們三兄弟的，官吏說。這裏不是他們的，你不能到這裏來玩，總理說：我到這裏來玩朋友我三兄弟的花園，他們常常對我很好的，這是他們的花園，我為什麽不能玩？，官吏頓時勃然大怒的樣子，說道，什麽？總理亦轉變强硬的態度，向着官吏道，我來問你？你們爲什麽把　們捉去？爲什麽還殺了他們的大哥？官吏被問得老羞成怒，竟拔出刀來，對總理說，小孩子，你來玩花國，我要敎你一個玩法，總理覩此情形，知道無可理喻，厲聲說道，你不要當是　你有刀子，就可以强奪人家花園，這　花園，是楊家三兄弟的，且說且走，大踏步向園門走了出去，又復目言自語道，有這樣可惡的官吏，唉，爲什麽會有這樣可惡的官吏？爲什麼大家准許這樣可惡的官吏橫行無忌？</p>
<p>其他，因爲篇幅的關係，不及多寫，總之，總理的偉大，在他幼年時代，已經看得出來了，看報的小朋友們，大家設身處地想想看，總理幼時，已經有這樣的胆識，我們為什麼沒有？總理人也，我亦人也，我們應該怎樣的修餋，學到總理的樣子纔行！</p>
<h3>雙十節的七巧剪貼</h3>
<p>— 仁</p>
<p>雙十節是可紀念的我們來做一次七巧剪貼罷。</p>
<p>在沒有動手之前，你先要預備下面幾樣東西：</p>
<p>（一）顔色紙（二）白紙（三）剪刀（四）尺（五）漿糊（六）鉛筆</p>
<p>小朋友，這幾件東西是很容易得到的，因此，這一種玩意兒也是很容意做的，不是麽？</p>
<p>先把鉛筆在顔色紙上照甲，乙圖劃了綫，用剪刀剪下來。照甲　剪下來的可以拚成2「十」十三字，照乙圖剪下來的可以拚成「4「年」兩字。把牠們統統貼在白紙上，不是成了24年十十了麽？如果顔色配得好，那也是很好看的。</p>
<p>小朋友們，這樣的玩意兒，不是很好玩的麽？</p>
<h3>値得讃佩的兩小朋友購衣賑災</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>共二十二件交市黨部轉發</p>
<p>今年各地水災的嚴重，災民的衆多：災區的遼　；諸位小朋友們大概都知道了，在這秋風已起的當兒，這般災民，冷了沒有衣服穿；餓了沒有東西吃；住的地方，當然更沒有了！試想；這種情形是多麽的悽慘！我們誼屬同胞，對於他們，自然要加以救濟。所以在這燈個月裏，大家都在忙着賑災，這實在是我們應有的責任。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友們，有很多環境很好的，在這全國救災聲中，應該抱着「賑災不敢後人」的態度，也來參加這種賑災工作。現在讓我把兩個能够實行賑災的小朋友的一封信介紹給你們看；</p>
<p>小朋友崔玖，崔中姐弟倆，看見報上所登的水災的消息，竟威動了！特地把平常積蓄的欵子，買了二十二件寒衣，送到南京市黨部轉發，並且還附了一封親筆函，原文是這樣的：先生：現在秋風起了，露宿的災民們—尤其是北方的——對於棉衣的需要，是多麽迫切呢？我姐弟倆，現在把我們所有的一點積　的欵子，拿來作幾件棉衣，送給他們用，內中大棉襖棉褲各五件；小棉襖棉褲各五件；小棉袍二件；共二十二件，分作兩捆，送到貴處，務請在一個月內替我們送到山東，發給災民們，這一點要求，能得先生的同意吧？此上南京市黨部的先生們。你們的小朋友崔玖，崔中啟。</p>
<p>小朋友們：這兩個小朋友——崔玖，崔中—是多麽値得讚佩啊！希望你們也來効法，不要使他倆專美。</p>

<h3>問問自己</h3>
<p>— 淳安縣立靑溪中心小學王驥</p>
<p>十月十日，是中國的國慶日。在這一天，凡是中國的國民，都應該慶祝的。不過在這個時候，還得問問自己。</p>
<p>讀書的靑年：要問自己，我這一年來，耗費了多少鈔票？果眞讀了多少書？對不對得住栽培我的父母和師長？</p>
<p>做農工商業的：要問問自己，這一年來，我爲了勞作出了多少血汗？手足吃苦得怎樣？有沒有什麼代價可以安慰自己？</p>
<p>負有政治責任的：我這一年來，口頭發表些什麼話？言行合一沒有？果直把所講的話做了幾成？對不對得住國家與人民？</p>
<p>除了這些，遝要問問：東北沉淪幾年了？究竟要到何時才可還我河山？</p>
<p>以上問題，請大家想一想，問一問，能不能够解答。我想，非但無人能解答，也許大家忙着慶祝，無暇理會吧？</p>
<h3>國慶與國恥</h3>
<p>— 浦東競存小學陸祖安</p>
<p>偉大的國慶日，是多麽的光榮。在二十四年前的今天，我們的總理，費了數十年的心血，就在武昌起義，把腐敗的滿淸政府推翻，纔造成了這快樂的國慶日。</p>
<p>國慶日，我們應該慶祝。然而不要忘了那悲痛的國恥日。近年來，　們的國恥，有加無已，想「九一八」，「一二八」，這兩次事變，是何等可恥呀！</p>
<p>從今天起，我們須要努力！須要奮鬥！須要把許許多多的國恥洗凈！</p>
<h3>龍湖小學十五歲女從今天起</h3>
<p>— 沈延英</p>
<p>今天是最光榮的國慶紀念日。本來是應該慶祝的；可是，在全國水災這般嚴重慘烈之下，叫我們怎樣快樂得出呢？還有先生告訴我們，什麽第二次世界大戰要爆發了。要我們好好讀書，好好練身體，那末將來可做後去的靈要工作呀！</p>
<p>所以，從今天起，我極力省下賣糖果的零用錢，來救濟災民，絕不再亂用一個銅板。</p>
<p>從今天起，我要努力用功，求學問，練身體，預備第二次世界大戰的時候，做後方工作。</p>
<p>另外，從個天起，我要研究科學，因爲『科學』是救國的最好利器啊！</p>
<h3>我要創造新中國</h3>
<p>— 池卜音</p>
<p>我是新中國的主人，</p>
<p>把我的志向堅定，</p>
<p>凡是要我盡的責任，</p>
<p>朋友！</p>
<p>我都要負上雙肩！</p>
<p>好風吹着我前進，</p>
<p>太陽照着我得勝。</p>
<p>我要創造新中國，</p>
<p>要做牠的主人，</p>
<p>凡是要我盡的責任，</p>
<p>朋友！</p>
<p>我都要負上雙肩。</p>
<h3>國慶感慨</h3>
<p>— 上海萬竹小學曹梅瑛</p>
<p>辛亥革命，孫中山先生創造，十月十日，定爲我中華國慶日，名曰雙十節，民國成立至今，已是第二十四個變十節了，國慶年年有，但是所過去的雙十節到現在，「國家，社會，敎育，家庭，」及一切一切的事，有那樁事可慶呀？</p>
<p>我是一個三年級的小學生，今年才祇十一歲，以前過去的事，我也不明暸，單記得我入學的第一憫國慶，先生說：「今天是雙十節，學校　放　一天，」領了同學們出外　行，表示慶祝，以後年年這樣舉行一次慶祝會，也沒有　麼別的表演，我也不明白國慶；是甚麽的意義！</p>
<p>國慶日前四天，是星期日，我在家中，爸爸　國慶的事給我聽，我才明白，十月十日，是中華民國最光榮的國慶日，國定的變十節，國民　當大家來慶祝的，伹是我常常看爸爸拿回　的報紙，所　的新聞，『國內水災，旱災，銀行商店倒閉，盜刦，姦殺，拐騙，離婚，捲逃」等事，竟每天都看見，現在那國外意阿二國，正打得砲火連天，避難者，扶老携幼，哭聲載道，好似我國九一八及一二八的慘事，都是强權演成的慘酷。在此快樂的國慶節，本不應寫這文字，我是很希望第二十五個雙十節，大家快快樂樂來度這雙十節，中華萬歲。</p>
<h3>兒童國慶歌</h3>
<p>— 殷憶秋作</p>
<h3>白山烏的故事（五）</h3>
<p>— 禧</p>
<p>我想重新鼓起勇氣來，不　意弄得像一頭落後的老母鷄一樣，但是再飛了一　　光景，我終於支撐不住了。</p>
<p>我又囁嚅地說道：「先生，我們能在這裏停會麽？我口渴得厲害，使我很感痛苦，我們倘能停住在一株樹上……」</p>
<p>傳信鴿怒道：「該死！該死！你實在是一頭山鳥」於是是他頭也不回，飛得高高的，繼續他的旅行。至於我呢，頭晕眼花，跌倒在一片稻田裏。</p>
<p>我不知暈過去了多少時候。到得我恢復知勞時，我所記得的一件事情，就是那傳信鴿的最後一句話；他和我說：「你實在是一頭山鳥」！因此我心中想：「呀！我的親愛的父母，如此你們是錯了！我得同到你們那裏來，你們可以承認我一個忠　而守法的孩子，而仍然給我住在母親腹下的一小堆親愛的樹葉裏』。</p>
<p>我掙扎着起來，但我一路上已很疲乏，而又爲的跌了一下，使我的肢體上，很感痛苦。我的兩脚還浚有立定，而一陣頭暈，又使我跌倒了。</p>
<p>我的心上已起了一種死的恐怖，不料在那矢車菊和　粟花的中間，我瞧見兩個很可愛的朋友，輕輕地向着我走來。一個是，頭小喜鵲，身上很整潔，模樣見也很風流，還有個是一頭玫瑰色的斑鳩，那斑鳩站住在數步之外，抱着很謙下的態度，並且極表同情於我的惡運：但那喜鵲跳到我身邊來，顯出世界中種最美的姿態。</p>
<p>伊放出一陣銀鈴般的聲音，回我道：「咦！可憐的孩子，你在這裏做什麽」？</p>
<p>我答道：「唉！我的貴夫人，我是一個可憐的旅客，被棄在路邊，現在是快要餓死了死了」。</p>
<p>伊答道：「天哪！你竟這般的苦嗎』？伊就立」？刻在四周矮樹叢中跳來跳去，從這邊走到那邊，給我帶了好多的果子來，在我旁邊堆成了一小堆，一面不住的向我問話。</p>
<p>「但你是誰？你從那裏來的？你是冒着何等的危險！如今你又上那裏去呢？你年紀很小，還是第一次長好了毛羽，却單身的出門了！你的父母是幹是麼的？他們怎麽讓你胡亂的跑出來？這眞使人的毛羽都豎起來了』！</p>

<h3>婦女道德會與妓女預約劵</h3>
<p>— 羅瓊</p>
<p>據十月十日本報載，山東省府韓主席夫人（高聖坤）等發起組織山東婦女道德促進會。發起的原因是：」鑒於中國現代婦女，維新者徒慕虛榮，不自檢東，放棄固有之職責。守舊者則贏弱無能，知識卑陋，墨守以往之陃習·致均將固有之舊道德，埋沒殆碍，女子之眞精神，泯減無餘。女權愈發逹，生活之墮落愈甚。文明愈進步，習尙之腐收愈烈。」這許多「至理名言」，的確可以說是中國婦女界之寫照。韓夫人等竟能如此赤裸裸地暴露中國婦女界的缺點，確是値得我們欽佩的。</p>
<p>不過這裏我們必須進而考察，爲什麼會「女權愈發逹，生活之墮落愈甚」「文明愈進步，習尙之腐敗愈烈。」以致「道德淪亡」呢？照般常識的觀察，女權的發逹，文明的進步，是道德提高的標幟，生活改善的前提；然而現在的情形却是適得其反。這是主要由於現代所謂「女權」只是少數人的女權，現代所謂「文明」只是少數人的文明。至於多數婦女，她們所受到的只是野蠻的壓迫。這種偏面的「女權」與「文明」愈益發逹，貧富懸殊便愈益深刻。因此大多數的婦女，在這「女權中」和「文明」壓搾之下，生活日趨貧困，不得不用或明或暗的形態，出賣肉體，維持生活。</p>
<p>這裏我們不需要列舉許多事實來加以證明，單看本月一號重慶商務日報莆男通訊吧！「福建的莆田，現在妓女充塞，她們成群結隊，到處皆是。這許多妓女的來源山於「鄉間人給內戰打毀了家園，他們逃難，他們失業，他們無家可歸，他們飢寒交迫，男子找不到事，於是女子們迫於生活，只好在城市出賣自己的肉體，換一口飯來維持可憐的生命……他們爲了生活，無可奈何的到街上去招蜂引蝶。並且在妓女這樣大量增加以後，接客極感困難，所以妓女對於主顧的競爭，當然更加劇烈……妓女普通優待主顧的方法是大减價和大贈品，可是這種方法，還不到能具吸引主顧的興味，於是妓女便實行買一送一的方法，兩個人嫖妓，只要一個人出錢一個人嫖妓，今天化錢嫖一次，下次可以不化錢白嫖。但這似乎還不好，所以最近兩月有些妓女竟發行一種預約券（每券一元或元，凡是拿預約券去嫖妓的，非但價格便宜，而且可以不付小賬，嫖一次妓女，比較平常便宜一半……到現在簡直沒有一個妓女不賣預約券。流通在莆田城裏的性交預約券，居然比鈔票還要多。」</p>
<p>看了上述一段通訊，我們已經再不需要任何解釋。就可知道，婦女「生活墮落，習尙惡劣一並不是單純的道德問題，而是一個社會經濟問題：道德所以淪亡，是有極嚴重的經濟危機爲其基礎。因此我們相信，只有眞正的「女權」和眞正的「文明」實現以後，即全體人民取得政治上經濟上的平等權利以後，所謂婦女道德才會澈底解决。古人所謂「倉　實而後知禮儀，衣食足而後知榮辱」大概亦是同一意義吧！這樣看來，山東婦女道德促進會，究竟能有幾分實際作用，完全是一個疑問。</p>
<h3>從全運會歸來</h3>
<p>— 蕪</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>有人曾這麼告訴過我：某運動員寫給他一個短信，寥寥的四十幾個字中間，竟寫了十八個別字。</p>
<p>又有人曾對我這麼說：在上海的某些學校裏，已幾乎把「體育」當作了在社會上爭「榮譽」爭「覇位」的工具。他們把一班運動健將，像爺叔一般供養着，不要他繳學費，也不要他上課，甚至他成年地不到校，也沒關係，只要他「肯」知道「餋兵千日，用在一朝」的當局者的苦心，到時在運動塲上給他們那麼一。</p>
<p>但在聽的當時，我確有些兒漠然，因爲，壓根兒這時代已否定像過去那樣可以閉關自守的時代，學校給學生們唸的書本，也不一定都是有用，眞正有實用的敎科書·還是這個現實的社會。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>這遭兒，全國運動會開幕了，我也跟別人一樣的在心底裏默示着高興。</p>
<p>在第二天中午到來的時候，我也擠呀擠的，在成千成萬的如醉如狂的觀衆間擠進了運動塲去。</p>
<p>可是，出來——即是說，我看完了我所要看的節目退出來時，心頭終於感着有些兒被塞住了。我記起了友人對我說的話，我感着它的意義了，較學校更大的塲合，不也是那麼地把握着，「體育一這椿事嗎？</p>
<p>這裏，我不敢把問題擴大，我只想來談一下我們婦女們自己的事。這年頭兒，也許只有談自己的事，還不致十分遭到忌視和阻力。</p>
<p>那天我看到的女子的節目，是五十公尺預賽和複賽。預賽分着四組，每組到逹到終點時，各處便照例地飛躍起比春雷尤響的掌聲。</p>
<p>輪到複賽了，全塲的情緒，看來，也似乎跟着更緊張了。</p>
<p>第二組起賽時，××起初是落在別人後面的，誰也沒對她注意，可是到距離終點只十餘碼的當兒，她突然衝上了前面，一馬當先，竟以六秒的成績，打破了全國的新紀錄。</p>
<p>於是人們的注意力，剎那間便完全集上了那位年紀輕輕，穿着白色運動衣的女士的身上。</p>
<p>捧塲的掌聲，喝彩聲，一時就像掠過一陣狂風暴雨樣的發作了起來。</p>
<p>攝影記者成群的趕過去給她拍照。</p>
<p>擴大機裏傳出了響而亮的她的名字。</p>
<p>她笑了，滿意的笑了。</p>
<p>這，道，你如果細細的去體味一下，你該知道骨底裏是包含怎樣一番的社會意義呵！</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>前面說過，我是不想籍「運動健將太不愛讀書」或者「結果只養成別無所用的人材」等等卑劣下流的說敎者的口氣來反對和非難提倡體育的，但我覺得，提倡體育的前題，我們是不能忽略的，在某些人們已可獲得眞正的自由平等的國家不必說，然而在咱們中國，特別是犧牲了不少先烈的鮮血，還只僅僅使少數智識婦女，得以在社會抬起微弱的頸項的現階段的中國，我們婦女對人們這樣的提倡體育，是應該深切地注意的</p>
<p>提倡體育的目的，是在强身健種，可是現在，很明顯的，它的發展，是畸形的了·</p>
<p>每僩努力體育的婦女，都該知道，除了努力體育以外，最緊要的，是要確定自己的意志，認淸社會，踏進社會去；爲民族，爲自己。</p>
<p>否則，你自己想吧，跟一頭被人當作玩具，畜作賺錢的工具的江湖賣藝者所富餋着的猻，有什麽分別呢？</p>
<p>靑春是有限的。即使你能僥幸的憑藉你運動的技　，能够無　無慮的過活一個時期，但，讓我重說一句吧！靑春是有限的，年老力襄就會帶去你的一切的啊！</p>
<p>往者，已矣！未來，我希望任何殺害我們的和欺騙我們的手段，落下我們身上時，都能像瓦片一般的粉碎去。</p>

<h3>回家</h3>
<p>— 蘇虹</p>
<p>於是一直拷到沒有聲息，像死蛇的一條。大家把他放下，拖在泥地上。拍拍他的胸，曲曲他的手，扯扯他的上唇中，又用筷子弄開他的嘴，把熱茶冲下去，慢慢兒他有點甦醒轉來，呻吟着，眼睛也有些張開。大家把他上半身舉起，彝在樟樹幹上。</p>
<p>——你現在可以說了，你們領頭的是誰？」</p>
<p>—我自己也不曉得是那個領頭的。」那强盜慢慢地說。</p>
<p>—你們一道裏的伙，怎麼不曉得的？」</p>
<p>—我只曉得年關到了，挨不過去，家裏一家人要吃，所以我們合在一道來搶的。」他想起了老婆，想起了兒子，老娘，又望望不能移動的腫紫的手，以及失了知覺腫紫的脚踝，全身骨絡疼痛，不覺流下眼淚來。</p>
<p>忠貴少爺又一道命令下來；說是領頭的一定是他，再打。手下人就取了塊板，板上釘滿了一排鐵釘，在那强盜身上打拔，打拔，最後還使勁地橫拉了一下。</p>
<p>一個娘姨走出來，手裏拿了一個瓶。說是老太太做好事的玉樹神油，給他搽搽傷口，又呌手下人不要再打弄他了，放他走。</p>
<p>—立福叔！請你把小的楝　檢幾根，我們有米，煮大鍋粥，今天就在我們這裏吃粥，立福嬸！你也不必動手啦。」嫂嫂看見立福打完强盜走過來，她想到需要男人的帮忙，從此應該聯絡聯絡。</p>
<p>立福叔站在火燒塲上，心灰意懶的拖楝樑，他回憶起昨日所說過的一句話：一燒過，索性燒過……。」他又想：「我是爲着簪別人捉强盜，整夜守候在山麓，如果我在家的話，這樣的禍也許不會發生，一起火就可搶險。現在是什麼都沒有了，爲了大家帮着捆那個强盜，連家具也來不及搬出一樣。自己已弄成赤手空拳，還去帮別人打强盜，又打成他那個樣子。……」他一時惱恨起來，笨氣又要發，緊握着拳頭，想要再打老婆。可是他望望老婆，她是蓬髮黃臉的抱了孩子坐在草穀堆裏，自然而然地手鬆下來。捧住頭想吼呌，但終歸垂頭喪氣地坐下在灰堆上。嫂嫂隨機應變地說：</p>
<p>—立福叔，你一夜沒有睡覺，難怪無力氣，過來，過來草殼上坐坐，曬　太陽，先休息休息。」</p>
<p>他眞的站起身，走到老婆的身邊坐下。恰恰修珍也在一起，他轉過頭，問：</p>
<p>—修珍！上海怎麼樣，有工做？」</p>
<p>—做工？我就是沒有工做回來的。」</p>
<p>修珍本在上海閘北某紗廠裏搖紗，她也讀過兩年夜校的書，她　得不少的事，後來「一二八」事變發生，紗廠被焚毀，就此失了業。起先還希望能在別的地方我到工做，竟白待了一年多，因爲生活磨折得太利害的缘故，弄成個身體像白蝨一樣，實在不得已才回家鄉來，可是回家鄉來……。她望望眼前。一片冒着烟的火燒塲，回憶　北戰後的景象。今坐在這同一命運的人群中，重過着難民的生涯；都市，鄉村，都沒有生存之地。她深深地覺悟到，只有退避，畏縮决不是一條生路。她稍微靠近一點立福，低聲地說：「如有機會，自然我們去找工做。眼面前，爲得要飽肚皮，可以先做一椿事，就是我們會了齊，向忠貴少爺去要撫恤費，你頂好講話，爲了你給他捉强盜，一樣東西沒有搬出的。」</p>
<p>立福點點頭，他肚里想：「如今什麼事情都肯做，就是呌我去搶，……」</p>
<p>太陽曬着，冰稍有點溶化，一般沒有家的人群在蠕動着。（完）</p>

<h3>第五回　婦女勞動問題</h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>婦女勞動問題，簡單說來，就是關於勞動婦女的地位及境遇的諸問題。其主要內容，在於改善工作時間，工資，勞動設備及其他一般的勞動條件等等。這問題是般勞動問題中特別和婦女有關係的問題，同時勞動婦女旣爲婦女，自然和婦女問題有關係，所以牠一方面爲廣汎的勞動問題的一分野，他方面包含在婦女問題裏面的。換言之，勞動婦女運動，在解放全體勞動大衆的見地看來，是一般勞動運動的一分派，又在解放婦女大衆的見地來說，是成爲整個婦女運動的中心勢力。</p>
<p>婦女勞動問題也和一般的勞動問題一樣，是起源於十八—九世紀產業革命。產業革命的結果，一方面資本主義的機械工業加速發展，需要大量的僱傭勞動，他方面從來自足自給的封建的家族經濟破產，家庭生活的資源，不得不求之於家庭以外，於是千千萬萬的婦女也同男子一樣，被迫而成爲資本家的僱傭勞動者。特別到第一次世界大戰中及大戰以後，婦女勞動遂行空前的發展，從來限制婦女勞動的重工業部門也有多　勞動婦女的參加，到現在，勞動婦女的數目幾乎凌　於男工數目，而且在勞動的熱練及技衡上也幾乎問男工並駕齊驅，但在社會的地位及勞動條件上仍然有男女的差別，即是在同一的勞動，對於男工的待遇及報酬等總比女工優厚些。</p>
<p>婦女勞動問題的嚴重的社會的意義，我們司從她們的勞動條件中觀察出來。這裏想把牠的幾個主要問題，分別說明。　第一是勞動時間問題。男女在同一工塲做工的時候，其勞動時間自然是同樣的，但在專用婦女勞　的一些輕工業部門，婦女的工作時間總比同部門的男工長些。現在雖高唱八小時工作制，但除了幾個先進國家，有少數地方實行外，大部分還是採用十小時乃至十二小時的工作制。尤其在中國，像紗厰一類的僱傭多數婦女勞動的工業部門，甚至有十四小時的工作，此外還有婦女的夜工制。這結果，多數勞動婦女很容易有疾病，更將影響於全體國民的健康。本來婦女因身體關係，不能同男子一樣作長時間的激烈勞動，假使男子要求八小時工作制的時候，婦女應要求六小時或四小時的工作制，但在這唯利是圖而不顧國民健康的資本家的榨取制度之下，這種要求，當然不是容易實現的。至於婦女及兒童的夜工問題，數年前在國際勞動會議中决議禁止，但我國尙未批准，多數婦女仍然受夜工的酷使！</p>
<p>第二是工資問題。無論某一國，婦女的工資總比男工少些。雖則在同一熱練，同一勞動的塲合，女工的工資不及男工的三分之二乃至三分之一，更有的塲合，不把牠當作她們的生活費給，而把牠當作零用錢給，因此大多數女工所得工錢都不够維持自己的生活。關於女工的工資低劣的原因，一婦女問題講話」的著者奧姆蘇是指出以下七點，即（一）認婦女比男子低劣的因襲觀念，（二）婦女的能率比較低下，（三）女工的敎育程度較低，（四）婦女慣於無報酬的家庭勞動，（五）女工大都是家族生活費的補助者，（六）在女工背後尙有多數女工後備軍，（七）女工的工會組織不甚發達。</p>
<p>第三是母性保護問題。如上所說，勞動婦女在長時閒不衛生的狀態之下工作，而且其所得報酬極微，衣食住各方面的生活都非常惡劣，因此她們都罹於災害疾病，損壞女性的機能，將不能完成　全國民的母性的任務。特別要注意的是女工的大部分爲未婚婦女，她們在結婚生育以前，受着那種無限制的壓榨與酷使，完全損壞了母性應有的健康。這决不僅是女工自身的問題，而是嚴重的社會問題。</p>
<p>於是，爲着解决這些問題，就產生了勞動婦女的解放運動。這運動在歐美已於十九世紀中葉開始，到現在已經和整個社會運動及婦女解放運動　合起來，而形成反對有產者的社會制度的主要的革命陣綫。</p>
<p>勞動婦女運動在最初是和男工對立的。因爲初期的工人們，階級意識非常薄弱，對女工看作競爭的敵對者而加以排斥，不許女工加入工會，但是經過一八七一年巴黎公社時代以後，工人們也漸次獲得自己階級的人生觀和社會觀，同時認識到女工的要求不單不和他們的利益衝突，反而更和他們的要求一致，從此以後女工們也得參加工會。更進而組織女工自己的工會。特別在巡步的政治團體的領導之下，向社會提出她們的要求，更爲着貫徹其要求，而遂行大衆的　爭。在現在她們的特殊要求是（一）同一工作，同一工錢，（二）禁止有害母性的勞動，（三）產前產後給假各二月，工錢照給，（四）設立免費托兒所，（五）確立六小時工作制等等。這種要求是女工的特殊要求，因此所所謂婦女勞動問題，一面有一般的勞動問題的性質，他面有婦女解放問題的性質。同時這問題祇有在整個社會革命中才能得到根本的解决。</p>

<h3>世界各國的空軍勢力</h3>
<p>— 貝蓽</p>
<p>意阿的開火已經揭開了二次世界大戰的序幕。這時世界各國的軍事力量，尤其是空軍力量，是値得特別注意的，因爲戰爭的勝負主要的是决定於軍事，而空軍在其中的作甩是尤其重大的。誰都知道，上次世界大戰中最利害的殺人武器是魚雷，潛艇，大砲，但二次世界大戰的性質主要的却是空中戰爭，化學戰爭。因此，當着戰神已在東菲降臨的時候，對於世界各國的空軍情形恐怕每一個人都想知道的吧。</p>
<p>但是，各國的軍事準備都很秘密，而空軍的力量更是爲外人所難探知的。在海軍方面，如果某一國家有若干軍艦，卽可公然判明，不易藏匿，但那一國的飛機的數量，外人就無法知悉了。同時，建造軍艦耗費較大，而且不是很短的時問所能造成，但製造飛機在各方面都較容易；一旦戰爭爆發，要趕造若干軍艦雖不可能，但要趕造若干架飛機卻是較爲可能做到的。因此現在要判定各國的空軍勢力實在很難。不過，對於世界各主要國家的空軍之一般的調查却是有的，且，就依這一般的調查也可以見到各國空軍情况之大槪。</p>
<p>據國際聯監事務局所編　的「一九三五年國際軍備年鑑」所載，最近世界各主要國家的空軍勢力如下：</p>
<p>意大利　一八六一　二六、六　一五、九</p>
<p>蘇聯　一八六一　一一六、六　一五、九</p>
<p>捷克　×七〇　×三四、四　二八、七</p>
<p>荷蘭　×四四六　×十一、六　〇、七</p>
<p>比利時　一九五　一〇、一　二、五</p>
<p>中國　一五〇　……　四、二</p>
<p>以上算是各國空軍勢力的大槪情形，當然這表中的數字不一定是　實的。同時，關於各國軍用飛機的數是及其隊數，本年日本帝國飛行協會　　的「航空年鑑」是這樣載着的：</p>
<p>飛機數目　隊數</p>
<p>法國一八〇〇〇（臺）一六五</p>
<p>英國一〇〇〇九〇</p>
<p>美國一〇〇〇九〇</p>
<p>蘇聯一四〇〇一三〇</p>
<p>意國一二〇〇一一〇</p>
<p>德國九〇〇八〇</p>
<p>波蘭七〇〇五九</p>
<p>捷克五六〇五一</p>
<p>荷蘭四〇〇三六</p>
<p>羅馬尼亞四〇〇三六</p>
<p>西班牙一一五〇二二</p>
<p>士耳其二〇〇二〇</p>
<p>中國二〇〇一八</p>
<p>南斯拉夫六〇〇五二</p>
<p>因爲這是日本的「航空年鑑」的記載，所以其中未曾將日本的空軍情形告訴我們。同時，共統計的數目字亦未必可靠，不過，同樣我們也可以由此見到各國空軍勢力之大槪的。此外，一九三五年美國出版的「航空年鑑」對於近年來各國軍用飛機數量的發展情形會作了這樣一個統計：</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>一九三二年一九一四年一九五三年</p>
<p>一月　一月　一月</p>
<p>法國四千（毫）四〇〇〇三六〇〇</p>
<p>蘇聯一五〇〇二二〇〇三〇〇〇</p>
<p>英國二〇〇〇二五〇〇二八〇〇</p>
<p>意國一八〇〇二三〇〇二三〇〇</p>
<p>美國一八〇〇一七〇〇二〇六〇</p>
<p>日本一三〇〇一五〇〇一八五〇</p>
<p>德國——二〇〇六〇〇</p>
<p>由此不僅可以看到各國現有的軍用飛機數量之大槪，而且還可以看到各國空軍的發展情形。</p>
<p>上面三表的數字雖有差異，但我們亦可於其中看出一個共同　來，那便是法蘇英意的飛機數量都較他國爲多·</p>
<p>現在，爲要更加明暸問題，且將各主要空軍國家的空軍情形略述一下吧。</p>
<p>美國—美國沒有獨立的空軍，其空軍是作爲陸海軍之一部（航空部）而保存着的。美國在軍　上的假想敵是日本，所以其海軍的一切設備和空軍的擴充都針對着日本。</p>
<p>英國—因爲在上次大戰中英國會痛遭德國飛機的襲擊，所以戰後英國便努力擴充空軍，使其成爲一個大的空軍國家。現在，英國所有的空軍力量，除在外表上我們可以看到的外，還有很大的潛在勢力。如英國的商船在戰爭發生時馬上就可改造成爲五十隻航空母艦，其民間的航空事業也與其空軍設備有緊密的關係。假使大戰發生，有空軍襲擊倫敦，那英國至少可以動員一千架飛機來防禦的，</p>
<p>法國！法國軍用飛機之多居世界第一位。現在，法國除已有的飛機外，每年還可製出數百架新式飛機。在巴黎現刻就有二十五個飛機製造所，法政府正在努力督促其趕造飛機。所以，一旦大戰發生，法國的空軍力量如何實非我們所能估量的。</p>
<p>德國！德國的空軍建設在希特勒宣布重整軍備後才公然開始進行。本年春在季戈林公開官布德國至少須有法波捷克等所有軍用飛機的數的百分之四十，依此在明年內德國便叮有軍用機二千六百架了。德國是重工業國家，其一切軍備擴充計劃都可於短期內實現，所以德國的空軍也是特別値得注意的。</p>
<p>意大利！從表面上看來，意國的空軍勢力似在法英美之下，但其操縱技術却較他國爲優良，其飛行的速力與高度也保持着世界的最高紀錄。所以，當此英意　突日益表面化之時，大英帝國對於意國的空軍是很注意的。</p>
<p>蘇聯—蘇聯近年來的空軍發展很足驚人，據一般調查，蘇聯現在至少有三千架軍用機，幾乎與法國同等了。其民間航空路的延長也約有五萬籽。同時還組織勞動者的飛行俱樂部，努力培養駕駛人材。關於科學的研究尤其努力，在未來的化學戰中蘇聯是頗堪注意的。</p>
<p>此外如日本波蘭捷克等的空軍勢力也很不小，但因篇幅關係，不能在這裏一一詳述。不過，就據上面的情形看來，我們也可以想見未來的空中戰爭之熱鬧情况了。</p>

<h3>全運大會開幕禮</h3>
<p>— 快馬</p>
<p>「喜事年年有，今年喜事特別多。」拿這話來形容今年的雙十節的確一點也不錯；十月十日是國慶，恰巧又在這天法行二年一次的全運會的開慕禮，更凑巧的是在上海市花了百多萬塊錢剛建築成功的運動塲上舉行。</p>
<p>在平常本來不大容易早起的我，那天也不得不破例起一個絕早去躬逢其盛。從家裹動身時還不到七點鐘，可是一路雙　公共汽車上却都裝滿了人在不停地一直駛過去；在站頭上等候了廿幾分鐘的時間，才祇趕上了開過來的第五輛車子裏找到一個座位，就這樣直駛到虹口游泳池門口停下了。</p>
<p>市中心的運動塲距這裏還有十多里路，可是那種熱鬧情形彷彿有傳染性似的早就在這裏開始了；人是像潮水似的湧着，一部一部的雜色汽車聯成一串，蠕蟠地像爬蟲似的朝前輾動。從寶山路開渦來的黃色公共汽車，駛到此地便脅遇到不得通過的難關；群眾爭先恐後的搶着上車，可是等到發現車子裏的人擠得像一包棉花時，便悵然的把身子往後一仰，人聲又一陣鼎沸起來。</p>
<p>「屈死，車子為啥不停？」一個年靑的小伙子看着那不顧死活的車夫謾　了起外。</p>
<p>「這許多人，怎麽停法？」站在小伙子身邊的一個摩登女子很同情車夫的說。</p>
<p>「再有車子來了，我們把它截住。」</p>
<p>洛個不同的性情在每個人的臉上吐露着十分淸晰的輪廓。一會兒，寧波和中國搬塲公司的搬塲汽車大批的駛來，才解决了黃色公共汽車未來的困難！</p>
<p>搬塲的車子臨時定價每人收費一角，還不到半點鐘，十多輛車子便都塞滿了，我也做了一條沙聽魚被夾在中間帶到了市中心。</p>
<p>一坐上了車，心境就不同了；車子像牛步的駛着，各人也不覺得緩慢，而且還　傲地把路上步行的人當做談話的中心。</p>
<p>「這樣遠的路，走起來可吃力死了！」</p>
<p>「坐車子，要銅鈿呀！哈哈……」</p>
<p>一會兒，車子停在國淞滬路上喘息着，人像蜜蜂出窠似的飛騰起來。運動場附近的幾條馬路上，到處祇看見人頭晃動。會出門口，一座古堡般的紅色高墻底下，開着三個狀如橋孔的出口道，人潮正朝裏　激着。幾處售　的窗洞口都堆　一簇簇的人頭，波浪形的在動蕩，神情都顯得緊張，焦灼，票午到了手，就彼此會心一笑，各　前程去了。</p>
<p>我佔的便官是不須買票，所以態度比較從容些，進了會塲，一種　　　　　　　　　司令台　　，使我不　　　　個　　。站　　台出口道　　了一下神，放眼一看，各面的看台上人都快坐滿了，紅的綠的衣服形成各種不同的圖案。約摸八點多鐘的時候，各學校的童子軍都開到了，南部看台旁頓時湧現出一片斜面形的黃色，同時，四面的軍樂聲一齊放出，整個會塲便顯羅着一種「太平盛世」的歡忻情緒。</p>
<p>林主席是會塲中最屬目的人物，他在許多人的簇擁中從市政府蒞臨會塲。這時政府的大員和外賓都已在「西司令臺」端正的坐着，聽說林主席到了便都一致地站起來表示敬意。長袍馬褂的吳市長這時連忙趕往入口道迎候主席的「尊駕。」林主席手握着帽子，銀白的長鬚在胸前　着，像吃醉了酒的老人似的頻頻向外賓及政府大員點首答禮。</p>
<p>在全運會開幕　之前，先舉行國慶紀念儀式；在呼一個「中華民國萬歲」的口號時，在塲的外賓也不能不跟着偉大的呼聲之後喊起來。</p>
<p>國慶記念儀式舉行過後，便是全運大會會長——即敎育部長—王世杰的「市面」了。王部長的身材很矮小，黑黑的臉盤，掛上一副玳　邊的眼鏡，十足的顯出是一位博學多能的學　姿　；在市府秘書長俞鴻　「司儀」的呼聲下，全塲一致肅立，跟着王部長的動　而動作。</p>
<p>未幾，三十八個單位選手　　　　　　　　，　齊嚴肅的　　　　　　　　　　大會　　　職員，一律　　　上　和白褲子，態度十分況著；各地選手尾隨着，顯出同樣的精神。陝西選手佔着第一隊，最後的「殿軍」却是「主人翁」的上海隊。各隊選手由「東司令台」入塲，繞塲走了一週，經過「西司令台」時，眼睛都機械似的一律斜望着「司令台」上的主席和貴賓，並開正步脫　致敬；「司令臺」上的林主席和貴賓也都站起來頻頻鼓掌歡迎。各選手行至「西司令台」前，按照着每個單位的「紅樁」前立定；大會職員便紛紛退至指定的地點；這才由大會會長王世杰向會衆作報告，大半都是勉勗之辭接着央市長？林主席，孔祥熙，朱培德，都先後對着二千多選手　　了許多「我武維楊的精神，</p>
<p>選手宣誓照例是由「主大隊」　即上海隊—選手一人代表領導，這領導者便是鼎鼎大名的王季淮。王君「上得」宣　台去，各單位代表部執着　成半回形，屏聲靜氣的等候着。王君從容不迫地向「西司令臺」上行一鞠躬禮，全體選于也都一致的肅立。接着王君舉起了右手高聲朗　誓言，一句一個動作，台下的選手們也伸起右手唸起來，頓時全塲觀眾的聲浪都給誓言壓平得像一條馬路了。</p>
<p>各單位選手入塲，最受歡迎的要算是東北，新　和馬來亞了。東北選手的黑白相間的旗幟則飄進塲，無數的群衆和司令台」上的貴賓的掌聲便像燒枯竹似的響着，在熱烈的情緒中顯出國破家亡的同惜的悲壯。接着馬來亞選手入塲，又是一陣熱烈的鼓掌，目延長至數分鐘始漸次停歇；這鼓掌聲似乎在向人示　，海外有有人」　！</p>
<p>開幕　　完成之　，接着就是本市三千小學生的太極操表演了。參加的學校有三十六個之多，服裝都是一律的白色短衣褲，黑色鞋　。共分六十隊，每隊領隊一人；在他們前面，有三十人的軍樂隊領　着，旌旗飄揚，撬着上陣衝鋒的行列。總指揮由褚民誼先生擔任，所以這天「褚太極」的呼聲便充塞了全塲；在「褚太　」的指揮下，表演了「裏　　』，「前臂　」等等精彩的節目。全塲　衆的掌聲又響動了起來。</p>
<p>下午田徑塲的運動開始了，一般在上午候車不着的人，在下午還是那麼熱烈地往市中心蜂擁而來。可是，正在人們歡　鼓舞的情緒中，老天突然作怪酒下一陣甘　水來，把會塲熱烈緊張的空氣頓時變成愁眉苦臉的悽慘；平靜的出口道上一時又嘈雜起來。這種嘈雜的動態一會兒便延長到運動塲　近的各　馬路了；候車的　　，爭鬥，謾　，各種聲音打成了一片，江灣路上先前的一幕又復重演了。最後，又是搬塲汽車來解决了這個困難。</p>
<p>哲學講座</p>
<h3>理性從何而來？</h3>
<p>— 錢匡時</p>
<p>人這種動物，他在認　上是能從廣泛的複雜事態中整理出體系來構成系　的思想，能判別是非眞偽，在行動上能依於合理與不合理的認識，去决定當爲或不　爲，指導他的實踐；就在戚情方面他也不但具有特別發展的憎惡與同情，而且還能用理智去調和他的感情，使它能得到正當的發揮和表現。所有這些，總括地說來，就是所謂理性。理性在人類是特殊發逹的東西，所以人是被稱爲有理性的動物。如果一個人，當他在行動或言語時不講是非和道理，只直　　根據　　　的　動　他的情　，　便會被人咒駡他是野　，是　　十足的人，就是說他是沒有理性的人如此，則理性這東西似是人的本質之所緊，沒有理性就沒有　稱爲人的資格了。固然，我們不能說理性之起源就只在人類中間才能發現它的萌芽，譬如判斷與同情的感情等等，不管它是怎樣的幼徲，但在動物中確已有了它的根源，是不能否認的。但是，無論如何，這種東西是要在人類中才更能充分發逹起來，使它成爲人類的生命之　微之一，大槪也不能說這　說法是十分錯誤的罷。</p>
<p>但是理　　　竟從何　　以及它是否永久不變的一種人性，這在哲學上便有了觀點上的紛歧。從觀念論的哲學開始處理這個問題時起，它就把「人是有理性的動物」這一命題過於絕對化和神秘化了。他們不從進化論的觀點去將人和別的動物相比較，從中看取出彼此問的程度的差別，因而早就斷定了這東西不是自然進化的結果。他們是旣不酋依於由動物到人類之有機體的物質組織形態的進步，逐漸提高了適應於那種進步的物質基礎所產生的精神碩果，去理解那發展成爲特別充分發逹的人類理性，又不曾依於人類之生產的社會生活的進步，逐漸培植和改變着人類的理性，使它向着更高領域發展，　說明理性的。他們只是認為理性是非自然生產的東西，是無自然根源的一種人性。這種人性，在他們看來，是秉自人類的肉體之物質基礎以外的世界，它從理想的靈界突然裝入了人類的肉體軀殼之中，人就以此變成了有理性的絕對和別的動物相區別了的動物了。柏拉圖的哲學就是如此。所以他把人分作兩部分，一部分是惡劣的肉體的物質機體，而另一部分則是高尙的理性。這理性不但通常被視爲是離物質，的肉體而獨存的東西，作爲支配肉體的靈魂看待，甚　是屬於神靈界的。理性是絕對善良的不　的東西，人</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>以此旣屬於卑劣的物質的　惡世界，也居於高尙的理性的善良世界。人要從罪惡中解脫出來，就只有去悟認和發逹他的理性。不特拍拉圖，所有的觀念論者都是如此，都是把理性當作非自然的產物，它是預存於精神世界的一種固定不變的原則，人就因爲他能獨自秉賦得這東西，所以人類是突然變化成的。就是大科學家湯姆生也是這樣地主張的。</p>
<p>但是，在我們看來，理性這東西　然很可實　，然而它並不是存在於自然世界以外。一切把理性當作非自然的不附屬於物質的東西，這只是野　人所　明的靈魂觀念的轉換。理性，無論從它所具的思維，判斷，乃至戚情的發揮諸能力之任何一種說，它都離不了人類的這些物質器官的活動。沒有戚覺是無從引起感情和思想的：不能思想就沒有甚麽叫做判斷，推理和認識等等，卽無所謂理性。然而威覺要靠感覺器官，思想亦不能不依靠腦子，甚至感覺和思想都還須憑借外界的現象和作用，所以理性就不能離開物質。可是人類的感覺和思維的器官？是沿　於人類的遠祖的動物器官逐漸進化而來的。在有了這種逐漸進步的器官組織，才有比動物特別發達的感覺和思想能力，理性也才被湧現出來。所以「自然」本來是沒有理性的，但是它却能使那種由諸物質的結合而被呼爲叡智的獨特的活動或能力發展起來，由於這件事，它就能够從自已的母胎產生出理性的本體來，理性因此還是自然的產物。</p>
<p>不但如此，人類原不只是自然的產物，他也是社會的產物，更只有社會的生產勞働的發逹，才能把人類從動物界中區別出來。因此人類的物質機能和其器官的進步，是勞働與生產的結果，手的產生固然是個例蹬，頭腦的發逹也是一樣。人類式的器官與其機能旣是生產勞働所造成的，而人類的生產和文化又都是社會的，所以理性的發逹就不能不靠社會的前進。社會的物質與精神文化的進步逐漸改造着人的本質，人的理性才逐漸在這基礎上發逹變化起來。文明人可以競談理性，野蠻人却不知道理性是甚麼東西，就是這個缘故。</p>
<p>因爲如此，所以我們不能說理性是永久不變的，它隨各時代的社會生活之不同，隨社會的分化的階層之不同，而各有其不同的理性的內容和觀戚。欺騙通常是問心有愧的，它會受我們良心或理性的裁判，然而當我們在鬥爭時對着敵人行欺騙，不但爲理性所許可，而且還是它所要求的。這時我們的理性所認識與判斷的是非以及它所指導的行動，雖完全和我們的敵對群的理性之一切作爲相反，但是却不能脫我們沒有理性。封建社會的一切組織，結構和社會關係，在帝王與貴族看來，是合乎人類的理性的，可是市民社會的人却說那是野蠻殘暴，只有市民社會的一切制度與生活習慣才是合於理性的，就是明證。由此可知理性不是固定不變的，它依於人類的生活狀態，依於社會進化的時代與階段不同而不同，卽依於不同的環境之變化而有不同的隨時變遷的理性，是很朋白的。從動物起就開始有很幼徲的理性的萌芽，隨着自然的進化又湧現出了人類的理性。而人類的理性則又隨社會的演進時時變遷，到如今乃至將來仍不停止其進化。如此則我們若把社會當作自然之一部分看，那麽理性是爲自然所產生，亦不斷地跟自然之演進而變遷的。理性在其來源與變遷上都不是神秘的，只是物世進界之總的演化的結果，理性不能離開自然和物質本身的。</p>

<h3>開印大吉</h3>
<p>— 洪鈞</p>
<p>我的朋友謀得了「××省印花菸酒稅×××稽徽分局長」工職，領到委任狀後便呌我先去接收，可是在旅館住了十多天，同前任交涉過幾次，仍沒有得着確切的「接任」期！前任馮某太油滑了：我初去問他何時交代，他的回答是：「等你們局長親到」；不久局長到了，他又說。「候省局命令」。這傢伙推三阻四的眞是有意玩戲法。然而我們局長也非好惹的，他很鎮靜而且有把握似的說：一老弟，不要着急，我有辦法。你同我去。」</p>
<p>我們在菸酒局的會客室裏同前任碰頭了。他仍是很圓滑的說了許多不能馬上交代的理由，而且語氣上還暗示我們不懂手續。這麼一來，我們局畏可變了一點顔色，帶着强硬的語氣說：「馮局長，你把兄弟太看外行了。假如你眞的有意爲難，那我祇好拍電到省局，說你抗不交代」。</p>
<p>那傢伙却有幾分吃　，給烟油染黑了的臉，也有一點兒紅，他咬着嘴皮思索了許久，　裝着，一副笑臉說：「這又何必？新任和前任都是自家人哩！並非兄弟有意遲延，實在，實在……」他爲難似的說不出下半句，於是改一改口、「李局長，你當然是「老公事」，稅收機關的情形想夾也很淸楚……。」</p>
<p>「這倒不敢，不過……其　祇要老兄開誠一點，兄弟也不會打官話……」</p>
<p>兩家比了一個勢口，覺得都是內行，於是心照不宣的議定下月一日爲「接任」之期。</p>
<p>在途上，我總想不透他幹嗎定要下月　肯交代，局長向我解釋着說，「老弟，你太　生氣了。這是官塲的秘密：老馮表面上說是照章微收，實際却是包給糟坊的，這是兩面討巧的辦法。不過稅欵要到月底　能收齊，假如他在月中交代，那商家便要抵賴這一月的稅欵了。這可不管，對於我們沒有什麼妨礙的。」</p>
<p>我們接任的日期很快的給當地的新聞記者訪得，第二天便披露在×報上：「×××三縣菸酒稅稽微分局長馮××調省另有任用。准於三月一日正式交代，新任李××將按期接收，現寓本市××旅社云。」這消息公佈後，「我們的臨時　公處」便　然變做政治的中心，有不少「　　臨門了。什不　坊經理，菸商代表，當地聞人，紳士，酒業公會主席，商會會長，總之，上自政府機　的官員，下至職業團體體的頭　，都陸陸續續的前來「拜會」，今天去了，明天又來，茶房不住的　「手本」，我們不住的迎送，眞是接待不暇，應付不開，遵麽一個小小的菸酒局長居然有這樣的聲勢，無怪人們都想當官了。</p>
<p>然而他們的拜會並非由於仰慕局長的聲勢，而是別有用意：大概說來，不外一，承包稅收，二，介紹職員。兩種都是難題，令人不好毅然决定，雖然前者因關係稅政，我們還可打起官腔：「這是財政部的章程，兄弟不敢違章而結交朋友，」但後者却沒有適當的理由可以抵　，因爲當了局長便有用人的極限。所以到了給人糾繼不過時，祇好很圓滑的說：「很好，現在暫把名字登記起，不過自己的位置還沒有到手哩。」</p>
<p>話雖如此，可是登記薄上却有百多個名字，一個區區的菸酒局怎麽容納得下？結果祇好斟酌介紹人的情勢以定取捨，所謂才具能力。在這兒根本失掉效力了—然而經過幾次的考慮和幾番的淘汰，仍有五十餘人「須至榜者」，這五十餘人中，不是駐軍介紹，便是縣畏力保，最低等的也是公安局長作　人三縣地方便有有三個縣長，還有三個公安局長，另外還有威風凜凜的駐軍）。總之，他們的背景很大，一各蔭酒局長是不感打架子的（要知稅收　關　有武裝，而且又是衆人所垂涎的「金銀庫」，假如不結納當地的政府和軍警機關，辦事上是有些掣肘的），可是，一方面，爲了自身的利益又不願意完全錄用，……這眞叫做「作官容易應付難」，就是老於世故，久歷官堪的局長也弄得有些爲難了！結果祇好减低薪資，勉强位置，等釗接任後情形弄熟悉時，再斟酌對象，實行裁减的辦法！</p>
<p>可是到了接任的頭一天，前任又送來了一本職員名冊，這在官塲上的規矩，便是移交職員，後任爲了接收便利和熟悉情形起見，是應該錄用幾個的。可是我們原帶來的有十餘人，又加上有力者介紹的五十多個，正苦無法安置，怎能再接收前任移交的呢？所以我們祗好不置可否的，打算馬虎應付過去算了。可是到了夜間，前任的大部份職員（約二十餘人）陸陸續續的來向局長「請安」，或是口稱「這賀，」然而最終的話題都是　結到「希望錄用」。有的表示做　忠　，有的自稱對於稅素有經騐，甚至有人仿效張松　地圖，盒出三縣　坊的名册，每月稅欵的認額以及前任的秘密都很清楚的呈現在局長面前，有的打聽得我是局長的好朋友，而且位置重要，於是便走我的道兒，要求我代爲說項。總之，這些人都好像　　的狗，對於求食的機會是抓得很緊的。同時他門雖是抱着同一目的—想得一位置，可可是見着人數過剩，便背地裏互相揭發陰私（　如第一個告辭了，第二個便來說他的壞話，）總想打倒別人，來完成自己的願望。然而不管他們怎樣表白自己，我們總是給他一個「沒有位置」的回覆有的見着事前沒有希望，便要求祇要一個「稽徵員」的名義，不要薪資。當時我眞不明白這是何種用意，可是一想到稅收機關的　幕重重，便心領意會了！</p>
<p>這一夜間特別辛苦，一壁要辦理明天接任的手續（如擬佈告，公文），一壁又要應付那許多求專者的糾緾，說了許多不願說的話，裝了許多不同的鬼臉，這在局長倒是司空見慣，在我却是一椿苦事了！</p>
<p>第二天便是三月一日，前任用紅禮封送來了菸酒稅及菸酒牌照稅的兩顆鈐記，雖沒有舉行什麽儀式隆重的接印典禮，但局長却也很嚴蕭的接印在手，於是跟即貼佈告，發公函，表示陞任大吉了。</p>
<p>這一天的「新菸酒局」（當地人所稱）特別熱鬧，除了別人來接洽，拜會，還有那幾十個「未來職員」都來打聽消息，等候委任令。局長因爲忙於拜會各機關，局上的一切交際應酬便落在我頭上了。這樁榮事比什麽還苦，有的人爲要求某事可以糾纏到一兩點鐘，要想送客又覺面子上過不去，蔽好按住一顆煩燥的心，唯唯否否的同他應付！好容易把逼一天的光陰煞磨過去，我已能感覺到十分的疲憊和厭煩，然而麻煩的事儘在後面哩這裏也不再細說了。</p>

<h3>國社黨的解剖</h3>
<p>— 史</p>
<p>柏林通訊</p>
<p>大戰以後，德國不失為歐洲最高度的產業國家故社會的構造亦日趨於複雜。加速率的機械化及生產的合理化使勞動者的需要日益减少，同時使一般俸給生活者—所謂白襟勞動者」——的數量約增二倍半。世界恐慌使勞動者中間生出許多的失業者，由是他們相率投入社會民主黨或共產黨去。至於那些俸給生活者，在世界不景氣中所受的影響也很大，這般人則大多投入希特勒的國社黨的陣營。</p>
<p>「白襟勞動者」的俸給額，旣低少而又無昇加的希望。統計男子的俸給生活者的月俸，平均爲六十三金元，然一半數人的所得尙不過　十九元半。女子的俸給生活者的月俸爲三十七元半弱，然其大半數人則還不過三十五元半强，所以構成國社黨的半數以上的支持者，就是這般白襟勞動者的婦女勞動者，其原因卽在於此。並且，年長者和年輕者之間的俸給額，着異甚大：靑年店員僅能得年長店員的半　甚至三分之一的酬勞；而若年齡達四十五歲，則這般年老的又被年輕的代替了。</p>
<p>三百五十萬的白襟勞動者中——其中有三分之一爲婦女——有三百萬人的生活　準被迫爲無產者。但他們却拒絕參加勞動階級，所以他們也反對社會鬥爭，認那是對於他們未來的威脅。白襟階級的大部分是退伍的將　，軍人的寡妻，退隱的店主等等，他們也不願承認和無產者有共同利害。希特勒的「余之鬥爭」一書中卽表示着這種態度。他自已在中等學校時，為了家計的艱難，中學輟學作勞動者，一時他也會從事過尖銳的勞動運動，但後來他又與之絕缘</p>
<p>支持國國黨的中產階級裏面，包含着小資本的小工商業者，那般無組織的小本商人，在大資本獨占時代，喪失了獨立的經濟地位，益戲利益被减輕，和資本與信用被縮小的痛苦。這般小商人階級都反抗大資本家的企業，而因爲大資本家又是一般勞動者之敵，故在這種立塲上，資本家又並不是小商人階級的敵。國社黨反猶太人的情感之熾烈是布爾喬亞所歡迎的，因爲總數逹五十萬人的猶太人充法律家，律師，銀行家，商人，貿易者，是德意志布爾喬亞的可怕的競爭者。在這個觀點上，國社黨與德</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>
<h2>Page 24</h2>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>國的布爾喬亞又是具有共同利害的。</p>
<p>國社黨也反映着三十億美金債務下的　　農民的苦悶和野心，一般小農對於都市居住者抱反　，而馬克斯主義文和他們的私有財產觀念相　，故他們與其投入勞動者的陣營，自然不如與白襟運動同流。</p>
<p>戰鬥的希特勒主義，由突擊隊實行此最尖銳的運動。這黨的戰鬥組織——突擊隊，不僅要擁護和促進黨的利益，並且還要扮演從前國民軍的任務·隊員多由一九〇四年至一九一二年間所產生的靑年組織而成；逼些暴力主義者多數是出身於大學，中產階級的靑年·（今日德國的大學生的產量較一九一四年增加十分之六，已超越德國工業所能消化的數量。近年，三萬畢業生沒有就職的機會，若再過一二年，恐將逹十三萬人。）</p>
<p>這要有一件値得注意的事，就是德國勞動者的大多數都加入了左黨而不願加入國社黨，他們對國社黨布爾喬亞黨的厭惡尤爲深切。吾人只要一研究柏林和其他大都市的投票統計，這種事實是不難明白的·可是國社黨並不理會這些，却還是希望其主義普及於勞動階級。</p>
<p>國社黨人唱變更，國際「的高歌。他們的突擊隊是以中產階級爲主的，現在要加募勞動者。而在支持勞動者反抗的立塲上，希特勒主義又成爲暖昧的東西了，對於同盟罷工，時陰時陽，不可捉　。譬如一九三二年冬，開社蠶與共產黨聯合實行電車　業。又，一九三一年柏林金屬職工罷業，希特勒黨的一個代言人宣言，說這次罷工潮要禁止本黨黨貝參加殆不可能。可是，國社黨執政之後，斷然實行一黨專制，曾幾次極力要占領馬克斯主義根據地的勞動組合，結果常失敗。</p>
<p>然而，希特勤黨向勞動者的宣傳却也並不是完全無效的事。該黨的組成分子已有十分之一至十分之一。五是從勞動階級而來，其中爲了謀職的希望而投入國社黨的也有。</p>
<p>國社黨向其黨員預約職業，往往得見實現，這是因爲他們和資本家，雇主們有相當聯絡的緣故。這種事實，若說他是一種奇觀，也未嘗不可·國社黨的全稱叫做國粹社會主義德意志勞動黨，而其實他的主要支持者却是那些爲該黨所作爲攻擊目標的產業界巨頭。（按：該黨標榜一切生產社會化之說）德國大富豪之一的胡根堡，謠傳說從前他曾有巨額資助，有人說希特勒主義之所以能普及如是之速的原因，是他能在必要時使用金錢和實力。</p>
<p>德意志資本主義之所以選擇法西斯主義，實因其對資本主義的禍害比共產主義爲少的緣故。且隨着德意志國內不景氣之日益加深，產業者及特權階級也愈益不能找着出路，因此希特勒就成爲他們的天之驕子了。</p>
<p>專述</p>
<h3>華僑在全世界（十四）</h3>
<p>— 鍾民誼</p>
<p>同時西印度羣島華僑的鄉土觀念祖國思想亦很强，他們所儲蓄的錢財都繼續兌回家鄉：雖然他們也和當地黑人通婚，但他們依然沒有忘掉自己是中國人，就是他們與黑人結婚所生的混血兒亦類似華人，其思想依然是華人思想。不過，正因為如此，近來當地黑人也日益忌恨起華僑來了，有時甚至相約起來搗毀華僑所開的商店。在此情形下，我們在西印度羣島的僑胞因爲得不到强有力的祖國的政治力量的援助，所以除忍氣吞聲外，只得悄悄地回返故鄉了。</p>
<p>六，非洲的華僑</p>
<p>非洲與我國相隔根遠，素來就無密切關係。明代三保太監鄭和下南洋時雖曾到過非洲東岸，但中國與非洲並未因此發生什麽關係。一九〇四年及一九一〇年間，因爲英屬南非德蘭士瓦金鑛發現，招募了中國的許多契約努動者，於是與我們素無關係的非洲才有了許多華人的脚跡。據調查，一九〇七年爲談地華僑最多時期，總數竟達五萬五千人。但自契約廢止後，這些華工卽隨之離去，及至最近，該地僅有二千一百七十四人了。他們多半是開雜貨店餐館或洗衣作以謀生，此外經營園藝的也有。</p>
<p>英屬南非對於華僑限制極嚴。一九〇三年，當局爲限制華僑入口，曾　華僑執照；一九〇八年，更發表「金鑛律」，不准有色人種居住於鑛區之內。此外如坐車，觀劇等，華人亦備受限制。因此，華僑欲在南非求發展，實甚困難。</p>
<p>除英屬南非之外，在法屬馬達加斯加島相留尼恩亦各有華僑一兩千人；同時毛里求斯島亦有華僑三千餘名。但無論在那方面都未佔得重要地位，所以不甚爲人注意。</p>
<p>澳洲</p>
<p>七，澳洲，及檀香山等地的華僑</p>
<p>澳大利亞爲英國五大子國之一。其地原爲過着遊獵生活的野蠶民族，居民中能務農和畜牧者很少。中國與該地發生關係遠在十三世紀，較之白種人之發現澳洲實際上要早得多。但華僑之正式移入澳洲却是在白人發現澳洲之後。因爲澳洲士地廣大，天然富源豐富，白人到些後卽努力開發，需要勞力很多，而歐洲離此又較遠，所以東洋人中國人便得乘機擁入澳洲了。待一八五三年維多利亞發見金鑛後，華僑前往者更多。一八五九年，在維多利亞的華僑就有五萬二千人，多分居在附近各金鑛區域內。此外新南威爾斯也有華工一萬三千人。可是，在華僑日益增加時，澳洲卽屬行「白澳政策」，對於有色八種，對於華人的移入拚命限制。首先是維多利亞州議會中，通過了限制華僑入境條例，其後各州卽繼起效法，多方限制華僑。所以最近三十年來，在澳華僑不僅未增加，而且减少了一萬七八千人。</p>
<p>檀香山</p>
<p>檀香山卽現在美屬的夏威夷；因該地素產檀香，所以華僑名之爲檀香山。這個地方原爲萬族薈萃之地，遠在土酋統治時代已經就有華人了，所以這里的文化很早就多採自中國。一八八〇年，夏威夷島上有華僑二萬，有許多是種甘蔗的。但島人對華僑甚爲仇視，多方排斥；至一八八三年島中頒布限制華工入口新律後，華僑來此當然更屬困難了。</p>
<p>一八九八年美國併吞檀島後，更行限制華人入境。及至美國兼併菲律賓羣島後，更重申禁令，限制華僑也較前更爲廣泛了。一九〇二年四月二十日美國曾通過了這樣一個議案：「凡美國禁止移民條例，於美屬各地一律適用。美屬各地華工，無論其是否在割讓時前來，苟未取得美國國籍，不准其來美國大陸各地，亦不准其往來其他各島。……」未完</p>

<h3>Japanese Soldiers Hold Another Meeting in Dalian Yesterday; Okamura Participates with Instructions from Tokyo; Foreign Ministry to Also Discuss European Situation</h3>
<p>(Dalian) A preliminary discussion of the meeting of staff officers from the Kwantung Army and the Japanese garrison in North China took place here this afternoon. The official opening will be tomorrow. Major General Okamura of the Army General Staff will also attend as chairman. Okamura arrived here from Tokyo this morning and will explain Japan's new policy toward China at the meeting. The meeting is expected to last three days. Lieutenant Colonel Yatabe, the army representative from the Japanese embassy in Moscow, is scheduled to arrive today to participate in the discussion. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) A joint conference of representatives from the Kwantung Army, various agencies stationed in China, and the General Staff Headquarters was held in Dalian at 4:00 PM on the 12th. Major General Okamura, Kwantung Army Deputy Chief of Staff Itagaki, and Commander of the Japanese Garrison in China, Tada, also attended. Major General Okamura first conveyed the central government's policy toward China, followed by reports from representatives on the current situation in various locations. It is reported that this conference will continue on the 13th and 14th. (Japanese United Press, 12th)</p>
<p>(Dalian) Major General Okamura of the General Staff Headquarters arrived here this morning at 8:00 AM aboard the Harbin Maru to attend a local military officers' conference. Major General Okamura's statement to reporters was as follows: "This conference is not as widely reported as a gathering of officials and agencies stationed in China to convey the central government's policy and listen to local conditions. I also intend to speak in detail about the European situation. It is said that my visit to Dalian is to moderate the hard-line attitude of the local authorities, but in reality, there is no difference of opinion between the central government and the local authorities; it is all speculation. I also plan to have a cordial discussion with Matsuoka, President of the South Manchuria Railway, on the economic problems of North China." (Dentsu, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Foreign Ministry has scheduled a meeting of the Foreign Affairs Advisory Council on the 22nd. Ambassadors and ministers stationed in various countries who are currently in Tokyo, including Matsudaira, the ambassador to the UK, as well as bureau chiefs from the Foreign Ministry, including Vice-Minister Shigemitsu, will all attend. The meeting will focus on the Italian-Ethiopian war and discuss European issues. Furthermore, they plan to coordinate policies toward China. (Dentsu, 12th)</p>
<h3>Japan's Policy Towards China: Hirota Will Explain to Ambassador Chiang</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Chiang Tso-pin, will soon return to China to attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and the Fifth National Congress of the Kuomintang. Foreign Minister Hirota intends to meet with Ambassador Chiang before his departure to explain Japan's policy toward China. This policy toward China was decided by a conference of the four ministries: Foreign Affairs, Finance, Army, and Navy. (Japanese United Press, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) With the outbreak of the Italian-Ethiopian War, Japan's diplomatic direction toward China is also rapidly changing. That is, Foreign Minister Hirota and the military's Kawashima are gradually aligning their strategies toward China. From now on, the dual diplomacy of the military and the Foreign Ministry will be thoroughly cleared up, and a solid, unified diplomacy toward China will be established. (China United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>London Circles Do Not Believe the Rumor of British Loans to China; Sir Leith-Ross Has No Authority to Make Any Suggestions</h3>
<p>(London) Well-informed circles here do not believe the rumors circulating from the Chinese side that Sir Leith-Ross, the British government's chief economic advisor, has suggested providing loans to China. Financiers are quite dismissive of this claim, stating that the knight's trip to China was without any preconceived notions and did not carry any pre-determined plans; it is unlikely that he was ordered to make such a suggestion. Britain is still bound by the consortium agreement and will not independently loan money to China. Furthermore, any loan would have to be publicly raised, and there has been no indication of any consultation with banks regarding this matter, indicating its incredibility. A Reuters reporter extensively interviewed various circles related to China and learned that this rumor was actually spread by influential groups of Chinese speculators. Their activities have now created a very negative impression in London.</p>
<p>Another report states that the joint committee of bondholders for the Marconi loan and the Vickers loan recently informed bondholders about the progress of pursuing the Chinese government for outstanding debts, stating that negotiations with Finance Minister Kung were recently interrupted by the Shanghai financial panic but have not been terminated. Sir Leith-Ross, at the request of the committee, brought loan memorandums to China for discussion with the authorities. The circular also stated that the committee has repeatedly brought to the attention of the Foreign Office that providing new loans to China before all old debts are satisfactorily cleared is extremely unfair. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The representative banks of the Japanese lending group to China—the Industrial Bank of Japan, the Bank of Taiwan, and the Bank of Korea—are scheduled to invite the Chinese inspection delegation on the 24th. (Japanese United Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>Eden's Broadcast Speech: Britain Will Not Retreat and Will Not Impose Sanctions Unilaterally</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The British chief representative to the League of Nations, Eden, gave a radio address here today to British and Ethiopian listeners, in which he stated, "Having undertaken a solemn obligation, we will not retreat." Eden detailed the work of the League of Nations, saying that there has been no delay and that fifty countries have already expressed their sincere desire for an early end to the war. He continued, "While humans are being killed and homes are being destroyed, we cannot delay taking any action. If Italy can turn to the path of peace, no country will be more pleased than Britain. However, having undertaken a solemn obligation, we will not retreat. Things have already begun quickly, and as far as the British government is concerned, we have already begun and should resolutely carry out everything." (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Responsible sources today firmly stated that the British government does not want to implement sanctions against Italy beyond what has been decided by the Geneva Sanctions Committee. The British government is not considering any unilateral action. The Italian representative, Aloisi, with the assistance of an American journalist, had arranged with an American company in London to make a broadcast to the United States, but the British authorities did not provide the necessary facilities, causing great resentment among Italians here. Today, British authorities stated that this matter cannot be considered a sanction because Aloisi's application for broadcasting was too rushed and did not allow for the usual necessary preparations, so the British government decided to reject it. Now that this misunderstanding has been clarified, there should be no more suspicion regarding the British government's actions. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Officials today confirmed that Parliament will convene a week earlier, on the 22nd of this month. This is the result of a cabinet decision on the 9th of this month that Parliament will convene earlier if the public deems it necessary. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>League of Nations Committee Formulates Financial Sanctions: Bans All Loans to Italy</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The sixteen-nation subcommittee organized by the Sanctions Coordination Committee designated seven countries, including Britain, France, Greece, South Africa, the Netherlands, Romania, and Poland, to form a working group to discuss proposals regarding financial sanctions. The working group held a closed meeting today, during which the following financial sanctions were drafted:</p>
<p>(1) Ban lending to aggressor nations.</p>
<p>(2) Ban underwriting public debt for aggressor nations.</p>
<p>(3) Ban the issuance of public debt by individuals or legal entities affiliated with or representing aggressor nations.</p>
<p>(4) Ban lending to banks in aggressor nations.</p>
<p>(5) Except for commercial loans, ban banks from extending credit to individuals or legal entities affiliated with or representing aggressor nations.</p>
<p>(6) Ban commercial loans from banks.</p>
<p>(7) Ban ordinary commercial lending.</p>
<p>All of the above measures were decided to be fully adopted by the working group in the afternoon meeting and submitted to the Coordination Committee for adoption. In addition, the working group decided not to prohibit long-term commercial loans to aggressor nations. (Havas, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Sixteen-Nation Committee today completed a draft of sanctions against Italy, the action is divided into three steps, and is now awaiting approval and implementation by the Fifty-Nation Committee. The contents are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Worldwide ban on the transport of military supplies to Italy; permit Britain, France, Belgium, Czechoslovakia, and Sweden to cancel arms embargoes against Ethiopia.</p>
<p>(2) Worldwide boycott of Italian goods.</p>
<p>(3) All countries refuse to provide loans to Italy.</p>
<p>The arms blockade is expected to be implemented tomorrow, but several countries may delay for a few days due to legal procedures. This blockade will be based on the list issued by U.S. President Roosevelt; this measure was suggested by British representative Eden, but an item on explosives was added. The Fifty-Nation Committee has approved the arms blockade and will decide on the ban on loans tomorrow. The issue of boycotting Italian goods will be discussed in the next session. According to reliable sources, Britain is also planning to propose the repatriation of gold deposits held in Italy. It is also reported that Eden told other representatives today that if other countries propose recalling their envoys stationed in Italy, Britain would be happy to agree. (National Press, 11th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Sanctions Committee today organized several subcommittees to assist in carrying out all tasks. The first subcommittee, composed of representatives from Britain, France, Greece, the Netherlands, South Africa, Romania, and Poland, specializes in handling urgent financial issues such as Italian debt. Another subcommittee, composed of representatives from Britain, France, Russia, and Spain, will review issues related to military equipment and key products. The Sanctions Committee held a plenary meeting today and passed the Sixteen-Nation Committee's proposal to maintain the ban on the supply of war materials to Italy while lifting the same ban on Ethiopia. The Hungarian representative did not vote. The committee also unanimously approved Eden's proposal that the arms embargo should include current contracts and adopted President Roosevelt's list, which he recently formulated when the United States prohibited the supply of war materials to belligerent countries under the U.S. Neutrality Act, considering it effective and convenient. When the Financial Subcommittee meets tomorrow, it will advocate prohibiting all financial accommodations to Italy. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Italy Says It Made Secret Preparations Early for League of Nations Sanctions and That League of Nations Challenge Must Be Confronted</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italy is concerned about the impact of sanctions on its economic status, not only on Italy but also worldwide, and is inevitably apprehensive, but still firmly believes that the League of Nations' challenge must be confronted. Political circles here are hinting that Italy made various necessary preparations early to cope with the League of Nations implementing economic sanctions, which have been kept strictly secret until now. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Political circles here seem quite calm about the Sanctions Committee's action to lift the arms export embargo against Ethiopia while strictly enforcing it against Italy. An important official today expressed the government's opinion to a Reuters reporter, saying, "We have long been prepared to deal with the impact of sanctions, so we are not alarmed by this." He also said that arms manufacturers must sell arms to the Ethiopian government on credit because "we believe the Ethiopian government does not currently have much money to pay." (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<h3>Hull Says the United States Cannot Follow, But Stimson Advocates Cooperation with the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Washington) Although the Sanctions Coordination Committee has decided to lift the arms embargo against Ethiopia, the U.S. government will not follow suit. Secretary of State Hull announced today that the U.S. Neutrality Act does not allow the United States to take the same steps as the League of Nations. The Act strictly prohibits the export of military supplies to belligerent countries. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) Diplomats here declare that, according to the current situation, the United States is quite sympathetic to the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy. U.S. Ambassador to the UK, Bingham, visited Foreign Minister Hoare today, and Hoare told him about Britain's full views on the League of Nations sanctions. (National Press, 12th)</p>
<p>(New York) Former Secretary of State Stimson today strongly advocated expanding U.S. cooperation with the League of Nations to stop the Italian-Ethiopian War. Stimson made this argument in a letter to the New York Times, saying that prohibiting the export of arms is not enough to prevent the United States from being drawn into the vortex. He now believes that the sale of American cotton and other goods to Italy will soon cause serious conflicts between the United States and member states of the League of Nations. (National Press, 11th)</p>
<h3>Japan Temporarily Stands Aside; Rumor of British-German Negotiations</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Diplomatic observers here say that the Foreign Ministry authorities are currently taking a wait-and-see attitude toward the League of Nations' implementation of sanctions against Italy. They believe that Japan is not in a position to express its attitude toward sanctions at this time, especially because Austria and Hungary hold different views, making it difficult for the League of Nations to maintain a united front. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Financial circles here today are quite interested in the rumor of British-German negotiations. It is said that Hitler may agree not to obstruct the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy, in exchange for Britain allowing Germany to raise debt in Britain. However, this has not yet been confirmed here. Reliable sources claim that Germany has long been planning to raise foreign debt, and it is learned today that Britain greatly hopes that Hitler will support the League of Nations' sanctions against Italy, thus gradually increasing the hope for this loan. Britain has also notified France, stating that Britain does not want to agree to other plans until the economic pressure on Italy is effective, and it is heard that Britain does not want to blockade Italy before the general election. The general election will likely be held in November, but France has learned that this election may be held earlier because the Baldwin government is eager to know public opinion before deciding on its actions. If the British people support the blockade policy, relations between Britain and France will inevitably change because France will refuse to jointly take sanctions with Britain that go beyond the scope of economics. Demonstrations against economic sanctions are appearing on the streets of Paris every day and are increasing day by day. Posters against the League of Nations' plan are pasted on roadside tree trunks, accusing it of drawing France into the vortex. As for the British Embassy, after right-wing extremists criticized Britain for enticing France to join sanctions against Italy, it has increased its guards. (National Press, 12th)</p>
<h3>Italian Troops Prepare for Second Offensive: Plan to Join Forces in the Central Ethiopian Highlands and Cut Off the Railway, Isolating the Ethiopian Capital</h3>
<p>Italian Front on the Northern Route: The entire northern front is still very quiet today. Judging from the military deployments, a large-scale attack is in preparation. Ethiopian rebel chief Gebraschai and ten followers have reached the Italian lines. This surrender has a significant military impact, and thereafter, the Italian troops on the northern and eastern routes can easily establish contact without losing a single arrow, and cutting off the railway line will be as easy as turning over a hand. (National Press, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to this morning's war report, Adwa has been completely surrounded by Italian troops. Two detachments of Italian troops on the northern route are also preparing to launch a large-scale offensive towards the central plateau. The first objective is the railway line, and the second objective is the Ethiopian capital. The first army corps is advancing on the left flank, aiming to occupy the camel route leading to Makale. (National Press, 12th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to news from Djibouti in French Somaliland, the three routes of Italian troops entering Ethiopian territory are now believed to be planning to converge on the central Ethiopian plateau and cut off the railway from Djibouti to the Ethiopian capital, isolating the Ethiopian capital. It is reported that one column is now less than fifty miles from Harar, which is the main objective of the advance from Italian Somaliland. The Djibouti-Ethiopia railway passes through a point thirty miles northwest of Harar, so it is relatively easy to advance from Harar and reach the road. The Italian army will allow the road to operate until it reaches the main station on that road, Dire Dawa, which is one hundred and ten miles southwest of the Ethiopia-Djibouti border, but the Ethiopian army may cut off the road itself. Currently, the main function of the road is only to transport food from the Harar area to the Ethiopian capital. One of the favorable factors for the Italian army's southwestward advance from Somaliland is that some of the locals hold grievances because the Ethiopian emperor confiscated their grain, and they are all filled with despair. The Ethiopian army is now holding Magale, sixty-five miles southeast of Adwa, awaiting the Italian army's advance from the vicinity of Adwa. At the same time, the Italian army that invaded the Danakil region in the northeastern corner of Ethiopia is now advancing towards Wossa, but because the Ethiopians have placed salt in the wells in the area, rendering the well water undrinkable, the Italian army's advance has been greatly hindered. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<h3>On the Southeastern Route, the Ethiopian Army Also Takes the Offensive; The Northeastern Route Is Quiet</h3>
<p>Ethiopian Capital: According to news received here today from Dire Dawa, the Ethiopian army has taken the offensive on the southeastern front, occupying the three locations of Walwal, Waltair, and Sogger, all within the Warder province. At the same time, it is reported that the Italian army is consolidating its positions in the Artiqli region of northern Ethiopia and is unlikely to continue its offensive in that area within two weeks. The northeastern corner of Ethiopia is quiet, and the Italian army has not attempted to continue its advance since occupying Mount Mousa Ali. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>Ethiopian Capital: According to a Havas news agency reporter accompanying the army, a new battle has occurred south of Adwa. The troops led by Ethiopian Army Commander General Qasa and Tigray Governor General Saiyum have surrounded the Italian army's position, capturing many prisoners and seizing countless Italian cannons, rifles, and bullets. Both sides suffered heavy losses. It is rumored that when the two armies were engaged in fierce fighting, the Italian Ascari native troops suddenly fled. Among them, several hundred Eritrean soldiers voluntarily surrendered with their weapons to the Ethiopian army, cooperating from within and without, and the Italian army was defeated. Southern military news: Officials admit that the Italian army continues to advance on the front line in the Ogaden region. In addition, 50,000 Italian troops are pressing towards Harar and the railway. The Ethiopian army is currently avoiding a major confrontation and is only using guerrilla warfare to deal with the Italian army. (Havas, 11th)</p>
<p>Asmara: The Ethiopian chiefs in the northern Ethiopian regions occupied by the Italian army and in the threatened areas are now surrendering one after another. It is reported that the Italian army's advance is almost like a peaceful development. A special Reuters reporter contacted Italian officers and soldiers and visited various hospitals and learned that the rumors circulating that the Italian army had suffered heavy losses are unfounded. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Ethiopian Capital: According to news received here today, resentment is rising in Amassia in Italian Eritrea, causing great anxiety to the Italian commander in the area. The people of this tribe are uncivilized savages and are showing signs of rebellion. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Ethiopian Capital: Although officials firmly claim that they have not (received news of the recapture of Adwa, but an Associated Press reporter learned from reliable sources that the Ethiopian army did indeed recapture the city. Although this news has not been confirmed, it is indeed reliable, and it is stated that the previous reports of the Ethiopian army attacking, annihilating, and capturing 2,500 Italian soldiers, in addition to seizing firearms and other military supplies, were correct. (National Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Harar: War reports here today say that Italian planes bombed the two towns of Webi and Seggudelli, causing many casualties, mostly women and children, and many villages were completely destroyed. Among them, the two villages of Teferi and Qatama belong to an important tribe in central Warder province. (National Press, 12th)</p>
<p>Italian Front on the Northern Route: While rumors are rampant and official news conflicts, neutral observers now believe that so far, the Italian army's losses in the offensive against Abyssinia have been relatively minimal. The Italian army has now completed its consolidation and is preparing for the first real offensive. The Ethiopian army has not yet truly resisted but is only engaged in guerrilla warfare, waiting for the Italian army to penetrate deep into the mountains, far from its supplies, and then launch a large-scale counterattack. An Associated Press reporter visited Adwa today, proving that the claim that several thousand soldiers were killed in previous battles is inaccurate. The Italian army is continuing to advance, but is taking sufficient time to concentrate small tanks and motorized troops and open roads. It is learned today that the Italian army is now advancing along the Adwa line in preparation for a coordinated offensive. (National Press, 11th)</p>

<h3>Italian Minister Does Not Leave Ethiopian Capital: Shuts Himself Up in the Embassy and Does Not Come Out</h3>
<p>Ethiopian Capital: Italian Minister Count Vinci and Army Attaché Colonel Cartriani declared today that they are now shut up in the embassy and are unwilling to leave until all Italian consuls stationed in Ethiopia have safely left the country. People in the Ethiopian capital are very surprised to hear this news. The Ethiopian authorities have now dispatched mounted infantry to strictly guard the embassy, unwilling to use force to compel the two to leave, but fear that it may be necessary to do so. The Ethiopian Emperor is now personally considering this matter. Another incident involved the train transporting the Italian Embassy staff to Djibouti. A first secretary, Detrini, suddenly escaped today. Soldiers immediately pursued him on horseback and in automobiles and streetcars, and finally arrested the official, escorted him to the station, and placed him back on the train, from which he disembarked (Reuters, 12th)</p>

The green desks and yellow seats are all in modern style, accommodating 28 passengers. There is also a lounge with soft sofas and beds for sleeping. The aircraft weighs 25.5 tons, was secretly manufactured, took three years to complete, and cost US$3.5 million. The passenger cabin is not noisy, and although there are four 800-horsepower engines, their sound is soft like a cat's purr and feels as comfortable as being at home. The speed is 65 miles per hour. It will fly to New York next Monday, then to Miami, and then to San Francisco, where it will be delivered to American Airlines for official Pacific aviation use. (National Press, 10th)</p>

<h3>Review of Economic Policies Toward Italy</h3>
<p>— Liu</p>
<p>The League of Nations' sanctions against Italy were declared established in the general assembly on the 10th through a "tacit consent" method. In today's world where justice is not upheld, this move can be considered barely satisfactory. The Covenant was already equivalent to waste paper, but now the countries revere it as sacred, also because if the Covenant truly became waste paper, Britain and France would inevitably suffer. Italy met its fate and suffered misfortune. According to Article 16 of the Covenant regarding sanctions against countries that violate the Covenant, "(1) The members of the League undertake immediately to subject it to the severance of all trade or financial relations, the prohibition of all intercourse between their nationals and the nationals of the covenant-breaking State, and the prevention of all financial, commercial or personal intercourse between the nationals of the covenant-breaking State and the nationals of any other State, whether a Member of the League or not. (2) It shall be the duty of the Council in such case to recommend to the several Governments concerned what effective military, naval or air force the Members of the League shall severally contribute to the armed forces to be used to protect the covenants of the League." Unfortunately, when this case was put to a vote, representatives from Austria and Hungary were the first to express their inability to cooperate with the sanctions. This is because Italy, Austria, and Hungary have an economic cooperation agreement, and Austria and Hungary are worried about having no outlet for their produced goods and also losing the convenience of imported goods. Therefore, severing economic relations with Italy would inevitably lead to serious consequences. Similar situations exist for Yugoslavia, Switzerland, and Germany, which are all major customers of Italian goods and have close economic ties. Austria, Hungary, and Switzerland are all members of the League of Nations. Although they do not agree with sanctions, the "measures necessary to maintain justice and fairness" cannot be ignored in principle and must be implemented. However, once implemented, it is tantamount to blockading their own economies. Germany withdrew from the League, its membership period expired, and its debts have not been cleared, making it difficult to say whether it can still be bound by the League's resolutions. However, it is also expected that it may take a neutral stance due to its relationship with Britain. The decision to impose sanctions on Italy at this conference was made through tacit consent. Those who were concerned about offending Britain and France would naturally not openly oppose it, so the true will of the members could not be expressed. If a voting method was used, the number of abstentions would be more than just Austria, Hungary, and Switzerland, and the establishment of this case would still be questionable, let alone its implementation. For now, let's not discuss the hesitation of Central European countries towards sanctions against Italy. Even Britain and France may not be completely aligned. Britain advocated for purely economic sanctions to be fully implemented in one fell swoop to subdue Italy, while France still wanted to proceed step by step, leaving room for negotiation. Therefore, Laval still said, "The aim is to seek a moderate solution," while Eden said, "Swift action must be taken." The attitudes of the two are evident. In addition, those related to economic sanctions against Italy include the United States in the West and China and Japan in the East. Italy is a major customer of American goods, so although the US President declared neutrality and banned the export of munitions, cotton and other raw materials and other commodities were not included in the ban. It can be generally seen that some believe that the US President's warning to domestic merchants to "be responsible for their own trade with Italy" is enough to prevent northern merchants from shipping goods to Italy. However, merchants value profits. If there are great profits, who knows if they will not brave the danger to pursue them? Japan, as a non-member of the League of Nations, is not bound by the League's resolutions. However, in order to express cooperation with the Allies and gain international goodwill, it will inevitably maintain neutrality. As for the relationship between China and Italy, diplomatic relations can be traced back to the early Han Dynasty, during the Roman Empire era. The two major powers stood tall on the two continents. Although there was no direct contact, their voices and aspirations echoed each other. In recent years, the friendship between China and Italy has been even closer. Not to mention trade, although its share in the total trade volume of the two countries is very small (about 1-2%), there has been unexpected progress since Mussolini took office. Previously (before 1926), China was usually in a position of trade surplus with Italy. However, as a result of Italy's policy of encouraging production through the Pan-European Union, its trade with China changed to an Italian trade surplus and a Chinese trade deficit. This cycle of increase and decrease shows that Chinese products are not of good quality, and failure is everywhere, which is truly lamentable. Italy's imports to China are mainly manufactured goods, accounting for about 80-90%. China's imports to Italy are raw materials and food, with food accounting for about 50-60% and raw materials accounting for about 20-30%. Among Italian goods, rayon is the most important, and it used to hold the top spot in China's rayon imports. Although it has recently been hit by cheap and tax-evading rayon, it is still able to maintain its position due to its increasingly refined manufacturing methods. In addition, silk and woolen fabrics, such as felt, flannel, woolen cloth, and tweed, and felt hats once rivaled Japanese goods but have also declined slightly recently. Other products such as vehicles, propulsion machinery, tools, steel springs, chemical products, jewelry, watches, and women's handicraft supplies all have considerable sales and have also replaced some products from other countries. China's exports to Italy include soybeans, sesame, peanuts, raw kernels, raw cowhide, silk waste, soybean oil, and rosin. Soybeans have lost their position since the fall of the Northeast. Soybean oil and rosin were originally used in industry, but the trade has suddenly ceased due to the emergence of substitutes in Europe. Among silk waste, silk noils are the most important. However, sesame, peanuts, raw kernels, and cowhide have maintained continuous sales in recent years. Therefore, the economic relationship between China and Italy is not very important.</p>
<p>From this perspective, although the League of Nations has set up an adjustment committee to facilitate the implementation of economic sanctions against Italy, there are many difficulties. It may first use an arms embargo to probe Italy's movements. Italy may feign peaceful terms while fiercely attacking Abyssinia to gain a stronger voice in the future. Britain cannot sit idly by and must demand effective sanctions or even voluntarily accept the League's control and assume the responsibility of blockading Italy to achieve the realization of economic sanctions. If Italy still does not pull back from the brink, the situation will become even more serious. Therefore, whether the so-called second step of sanctions can be resolved in the same way as today with tacit consent is also a matter of the League's survival.</p>

<h3>The Flood Situation in the Coastal Region is Increasingly Urgent: The Water Level in the Liutang River is Still Rising Sharply; Both the Old and New Dikes in Lianshui have Collapsed</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to road reports, the Yunhe Dike in Zhang Liyao, near the county seat of Suqian, once collapsed, but fortunately, the people were able to rescue it, preventing an accident. After the breach in the Yi River, the Su County government has sent personnel to be stationed permanently in the engineering section to supervise the defense. However, the water dam in the lower reaches is not releasing water, and the flow is not smooth, making it difficult for the upstream to discharge. Therefore, the water level in Xuzhou is falling very slowly, and the flood situation in the coastal region is increasingly urgent. (12th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to coastal reports, the water level around Cibanpu in Guanyun County is rising without falling, and the embankment of the Weixi Salt River is in danger. The county government has mobilized military police and civilians to rescue it. All rickshaw pullers have been conscripted to participate, and the villagers are digging and burning the dry section of the Xiang River to discharge salt water into the sea, and also opening the Shanhou River to a length of seven li to facilitate the flow of the four tributaries. The Xiang River is currently under construction and will be completed within days, while the Shanhou River still needs to be dredged. (12th Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Senator Pittman Satisfied with Government Silver Purchase Policy; Investigation Report to be Released Early Next Year</h3>
<p>Salt Lake City, USA Senator Pittman, who investigated the government's silver purchase policy, announced today that the investigation committee will meet tomorrow to draft a report based on the materials obtained by the committee's investigation. This report will be released in January next year. The government's silver purchase plan is in line with what we expected. President Roosevelt is sincerely implementing the various clauses in the law, that is, continuing to purchase silver until the United States' silver reserves reach 25% of the national currency reserves, or the silver price rises to $1.29 per ounce. Pittman, replying to silver advocates who opposed the silver price rising too slowly, said that when the Treasury Department purchases silver, the low silver price will greatly benefit the Treasury Department. The Treasury Department has so far gained $400,000,000 from purchasing silver at low prices. Pittman further stated that most economists believe that a sharp increase in the silver price will disrupt contracts and general business conditions in Mexico, China, Spain, and India. This effect may force the aforementioned countries to abandon the silver standard and replace it with managed currencies. If this comes to pass, silver worldwide will lose its currency value, and the American silver advocates' dream of a silver price of $1.29 per ounce will be shattered. (11th National Dispatch)</p>

<h3>Shandong Province Determines the Flood Diversion Project Plan; The Lishengtun Jiangsu Dam Project is Scheduled to Start Construction</h3>
<p>Jinan Communication: The Shandong Province Flood Diversion Conference was held at 8:00 AM on the morning of the 9th in the Construction Department. Zhang Honglie, Li Shuchun, Wang Xiangrong (representing Kong Lingyu), Zhang Shaotang (representing Wan Qingyong), Huang Shuihui, Acting Chairman of the Committee Kong Xiangrong, Secretary-General Zhang Hanying, Secretary Wang Xinlian, and Inspection Director Liu Bingzhong all attended. Wang Lutai, Zhou Fushi, Zhang Lianjia, Zhao Yunxie, Song Wentian, Pan Yifen, Yu Haomin, and others were all present. Chairman Zhang Honglie, the most important agenda item was the flood diversion project plan. At the conference, Kong Xiangrong actively advocated rushing to complete the preliminary basic works of the Lishengtun remnant dam head wrapping to extend the Jiangsu Dam, and building the Tiao Liu Dam, etc., and laying a large railway between Lanfeng and Dongbatou. According to the original plan proposed by Zhou Li, it would not be completed until March next year, which was considered too slow and would delay the flood diversion. After discussion, it was decided to advance the construction date. Lishengtun was approved to start construction on the 15th, and the Jiangsu Dam and other projects were approved to start construction on the 20th. The extension of the dam starts from the tenth dam root and extends eastward for two kilometers as the dam base of the east dam for flood diversion. Afterwards, four more Tiao Liu stone dams will be built, all scheduled to be completed before the Lunar New Year. It was also decided to send Chief Engineer Song Wentian to Dongzhuang to supervise the soil construction bidding. Pan Yifen, the engineering section chief of the River Affairs Bureau, will first go to the entrance to prepare everything. The flood diversion project plan has been fully approved, and the construction cost is still 4,800,5939 yuan. After being approved by the Shandong Provincial Government's administrative meeting on the 11th, it will be sent by the Shandong Provincial Government to the Economic Committee and the Yellow River Committee for approval and implementation. Subsequently, many other important cases were discussed and adjourned at 10:00 AM. At 10:00 PM on the evening of the 9th, Kong Xiangrong and Zhang Hanying took the second train on the Jiaoji Railway from Jinan to Qingdao to negotiate with the members of the Jiaoji Railway Bureau on borrowing railway tracks to lay the large railway between Lanfeng and Dongbatou. Because the soil is very difficult to obtain at the entrance and the demand is also large, it is feared that the light railway will not be able to meet the urgent needs, so Kong strongly advocated handling it so that the light railway can transport soil and the large railway can specialize in transporting other materials. Kong will return to Jinan after a short stay in Qingdao, and then return to Bian to preside over the four-province levee restoration project conference on the 15th. After the meeting in Bian, Kong is scheduled to go to Dongzhuang with Zhang Honglie and others on the 20th to inspect the entrance. At that time, Han Fuju will also go to Dongzhuang from Jinan to meet with Kong and others. (9th)</p>
<h3>Jianghan Engineering Bureau Decision: Steps for Blocking Breaches and Restoring Embankments – Xi Dejiong Assumes the Position of Director of the Engineering Bureau –</h3>
<p>Hankou Communication: The National Economic Commission, considering this year's severe flooding and the near-total collapse of the Jianghan dikes, has specially appointed Xi Dejiong as the Director of the Jianghan Engineering Bureau to oversee the planning and restoration efforts. Xi arrived in Hankou on the 8th and reported to the Bureau on the 9th, simultaneously receiving the official seal, documents, registers, books, instruments, and materials. Xi Shuo was appointed as the Chief Secretary, and Xi Defeng as the cashier. The remaining staff members remained unchanged, and the appointments were reported to the Economic Commission, the Headquarters, and the Provincial Government, as well as an announcement of his assumption of office. According to Xi's talk on future water management policies, the flooding in Hubei Province this year is extremely severe, comparable to the great flood of the 20th year of the Republic (1931), surpassing all provinces in the Yangtze River basin. The National Economic Commission is paying close attention to the flooding in Hubei. Because I served as the Director of the Work Relief Department of the National Government's Flood Relief Association in the 20th year of the Republic, I have some knowledge of the dikes in Hubei. Therefore, I was ordered to come to Hubei to handle the project of blocking breaches and restoring embankments, and to discuss with the officials and elders of Hubei the overall plan for dikes, water conservancy, so that the Jiangxiang basin can reduce the suffering of floods and celebrate peace together. Regarding the progress of the project, based on my limited view, there are several points: (1) Breach Blocking Project: Among the breaches of the dikes in Hubei this time, those in the upper reaches of the Xiang River, such as Sansi Gong, are the largest. It is planned to personally inspect and plan within one or two days, and start construction as soon as possible. Other places such as Mabuguai in Jianli, Dong Dayuan in Gong'an, and Chen Gongyuan in Shishou will also be inspected and their progress supervised. (2) Annual Dike Restoration Project: Hubei has always had annual maintenance after major floods. This time, the dikes are too damaged. All restoration and reinforcement projects will be larger than in previous years. In addition to ordering the various engineering offices to conduct thorough surveys and reports, I will also personally go to various places to assess the situation, and then plan the construction. It is preliminarily planned that at least the original state of each dike must be restored. As for the projects of raising and thickening the dikes, they will be gradually carried out as needed, depending on economic strength. (3) The Fundamental Plan for the Governance of the Jiangxiang River: There are many suggestions from various parties after this year's major flood. However, this matter is of great importance and still needs careful planning. The Jiangxiang basin has close relationships with the rivers and lakes of various provinces. It is necessary to wait for the central government to make an overall plan and formulate specific measures before implementing them. (4) Project Funds: Hubei has always relied on dike construction donations for funding. This year, due to excessive spending on flood prevention, there is little remaining. The central government is concerned about the severity of the disaster in Hubei and has decided to allocate funds for subsidies. The amount will be determined after the total amount of funds required for the breach blocking and dike restoration projects is estimated, and then reported to the Economic Commission for approval. (5) The Annual Flood Prevention of the Jianghan River is a complex and heavy task. It is planned to discuss practical measures with local officials and elders, which can be implemented for future reference, so that cooperation can achieve twice the result with half the effort.

<p>Nanchang: A Major Shock in the Market: Six Firms, Including Hu Yuanxing, Collapse Simultaneously: Hundreds of Thousands of Dollars Involved</p>
<p>Nanchang Communication: Since the collapse of the Jiangxi Bank with over 1.5 million yuan in the 15th year of the Republic (1926), the financial market in Jiangxi Province has been declared bankrupt. Since then, various industries have been trying to shrink their operations in order to revive their businesses. However, from the 16th year of the Republic (1927) to the 24th year of the Republic (1935), the Communists caused chaos everywhere, the rural areas collapsed further, and all industries were at a standstill. Fortunately, Nanchang was able to maintain its operations because President Chiang Kai-shek was stationed there to suppress the Communists, and many people from various counties fled to Nanchang to avoid the Communists. Industries such as foreign groceries, silk fabrics, piece goods, and Beijing pastries expanded. Until last year, when the Communist bandits were suppressed, President Chiang Kai-shek left Jiangxi for Sichuan, and the armies were transferred elsewhere, the market gradually returned to normal. The total value of import and export trade, which used to be 10 million yuan a year, has decreased to 5 million yuan. It is unclear where it will end. However, the expenses of major stores are very high, but business has plummeted. It is estimated that this year's business is only 30-40% of last year's, so the actual decline is unbearable. Moreover, the financial market in Nanchang follows Shanghai's lead. This year, due to the tight money supply, the interest rates on short-term loans have skyrocketed, with daily interest rates often being 5 jiao per thousand yuan. Some businesses with insufficient capital rely on short-term loans from money lenders, which puts them in a difficult position. The so-called "prestige businesses" find it even more difficult to survive. At the end of the first half of the year, businesses such as Song Shengfu, Kang Hengjiu, and Yue had already collapsed. This was just the beginning of the cracks. On the 6th of this month, five gold and silver shops, including Hu Yuanxing, Risheng, Chunhe, a branch of Yuanxing, and the Hong Kong Silver House, and the Xinda Hengxiang Bridal Goods Wholesale Store, collapsed simultaneously. It is reported that Hu Yuanxing is a major player in the Nanchang business community, who once served as the president of the Chamber of Commerce and is currently a member of the executive committee of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, Hu Mintang, who has been in business for nearly 40 years. On the surface, it looks like the business is booming, but in reality, the scope of the business has expanded, the organization is lax, the number of branches has increased, and the expenses are huge. At the same time, because the capital is limited, he has to do everything possible to raise funds and arrange things, and high-interest loans are inevitable. Because of these reasons, the store had unstable news during the Dragon Boat Festival and the Mid-Autumn Festival. Fortunately, Hu was able to cope with the situation and barely managed to maintain the business until recently. Hu lost hundreds of thousands of yuan in Shanghai due to speculative trading. On the 1st of this month, when he was exchanging the gold price of a bank in Shanghai, he had no money to pay. He delayed the exchange until the 7th. On the 6th, an accountant from a certain organization went to withdraw 1,000 yuan. The store actually pawned jewelry to cope with the withdrawal. The news was leaked, and creditors gathered. The store had no choice but to close down. When the liquidation notice was posted, the store owner and important staff had already fled. Creditors gathered and were unable to find a solution. According to estimates from the general business community, the Yuanxing Gold Shop and its five affiliated companies owe about 500,000 to 800,000 yuan in this city, and about 1 million yuan in other cities such as Shanghai. The total amount involved is about 1 million yuan. As a result, the market was greatly shocked. Businesses with insufficient strength that have dealings with Yuanxing and other companies may also find it difficult to support themselves. (October 7th) The banking industry appears to be very developed, but lacks a sound business plan.</p>
<p>Fuzhou Communication: Fuzhou, due to its geographical and historical connections, is the center of trade in northern and central Fujian. The value of imported and exported goods reaches over 80 million yuan annually. The export of local products accounts for 65% of the province's total. In the past, the circulation of finance was centered on money shops. At its peak, the amount of loans released reached over 10 million yuan, which had a great impact on the adjustment of funds for agriculture, industry, and commerce. In recent years, due to the impact of the global economic downturn and the ravages of natural disasters and bandits, the export volume of major products such as tea, wood, paper, and bamboo shoots has decreased sharply year by year. Commerce has declined, and the money shops have been unable to recover the loans they released, which has led to difficulties in turnover. Therefore, they have closed down one after another, and banks have risen to replace them. It is estimated that five banks have opened in the past year, including Xintai, Jiaotong, China Industrial, China Farmers, and Fuzhou Commercial, accounting for nearly one-third of the new banks established in the province last year (16 new banks were established in the province last year). Together with the original China, Central, Huainan, and Southeast, there are a total of nine banks. There are currently five banks in preparation, including the Provincial (opening on October 15), Huinan, Yunong, Fujue, and China General Commercial. However, although there are many banks, they rarely accommodate industry and commerce. Because the loans released by money shops in the past were all based on credit, it was difficult to recover them. The banks, learning from their mistakes, strictly adhere to the principle of not lending without collateral, and do not provide any accommodation. Therefore, the stagnation of industry and commerce is not alleviated by the increase in the number of banks. At the same time, the banks' own businesses are also wandering down the wrong path due to the lack of a sound business plan and healthy targets. As a result, businesses that are not beneficial to the social economy are scrambled for by various banks, and unnecessary and improper competition between peers is also born. Therefore, the support of public economy and the lending to institutions have become the sewers for absorbing the surplus capital of banks, and the issuance and promotion of banknotes and the attraction of high-interest hot money have become important businesses of banks. However, the support of public economy is mostly used to make up for the government's deficits or to provide intangible consumption, which indirectly increases the burden on citizens. As for the lending to other institutions (especially tax collection agencies), it only helps to increase their consumption or aggravate their exploitation, which conflicts with the interests of the public. The promotion of banknote issuance is the most intense focus of competition among Fuzhou banks today. However, each bank only cares about its own immediate interests and does not consider whether the market needs it. As a result, unnatural expansion follows. It is found that the way to promote the issuance of banknotes mostly relies on military and political institutions. Therefore, the payment of salaries to the army and the issuance of salaries to institutions are the key points for banks to compete for issuance. For customers who receive banknotes, most of them can use them for free for one month without interest, and even one or two of them give a rebate of 5 per mille. However, the banknotes issued by Fuzhou banks are mostly subject to regional restrictions, and are only limited to one corner. If they are not improved, the competition between peers will become more intense, and the roots of disaster will be buried deeper. Once they erupt, the consequences will be disastrous.

<h3>Investigation of Levee Conditions in Various Areas after the Flood in Guangdong Province – River Management Association Urges Establishment of Levee Management Boards –</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: Since autumn, the floodwaters in various rivers in Guangdong Province have receded. The flooded areas are now rushing to build autumn levees and plant late rice seedlings. In a few counties, due to the prolonged flooding, the late rice harvest is completely hopeless, and signs of a poor harvest are emerging. The River Management Association believes that if the dikes in various villages are not fundamentally repaired to prevent flooding in the past years, the future troubles will be endless. Taking advantage of the deep autumn and low water levels, now is the right time to repair the levees. The Association has sent engineers to various rivers to investigate the levee conditions, so as to plan repairs. At the same time, the Association has also instructed the villages near the affected levees to establish levee management boards to manage the affairs. According to the survey results obtained yesterday, the dikes in the lower reaches of the Han River in Chao'an County have not been repaired for many years. A slight rise in the tide will cause flooding in nearby villages such as Pengou, Tingqi, and Shanshan. The River Management Association has ordered the local flood relief association to be reorganized into the Xiapon District Dike Management Board, so as to repair the dikes in a serious manner. The engineers sent out to investigate the levee conditions in the West River have also completed the investigation of the collapsed sections of the levees along the West River. It is estimated that the outer slope of the Fuzhou Levee in Nanhai County has collapsed, and the entire levee must be widened and raised. The outer dike of the Dazha Levee has been washed away by water, and the levee is standing upright for 100 meters, which is quite dangerous. The Guanzhou base of the Luoge Levee has been washed away by water, and the cliffs are like standing walls, making it difficult to repair. The Huagang Levee needs to be raised and widened. The outer dike of the Liangzao Levee has been removed for 12 meters. The Dacha Levee has been washed away for about 2 meters. The Shali, Yufeng, and Fengdeng Levees have been repaired by the villagers, but the height of the levee base is insufficient. The rice fields inside the Dazha Miezhu Levee cover an area of about 35,000 mu, and 60% of them were flooded. The Xialiao Levee is quite dangerous. The base of the Bai Meigang of the Taihe Levee in Gaoyao County has been slightly removed. The base of the Ma Ning Levee is too low. The outer base of the E Tang Levee has been slightly removed. The Chi Tang Levee was breached once last year, and it has collapsed again this year. The Taihe Levee shows slight cracks. The base of the Baishi Levee has collapsed. The levee body of the Luoxiu Levee is leaking. The Fengle Levee spans three counties: Gaoyao, Sihui, and Sanshui. The Gaoyao section covers an area of 9,000 mu. During the flood, the villagers spent 9,000 yuan to rush to build the levee and were declared safe. The Xiangshan Levee has been cut off by water. The conditions of the Dasha Levee in Gaoming County have not been fully investigated due to the unretreating floodwaters. One-third of the base of the Xiuli Levee has collapsed. The levee body of the Sanzhou Levee has been slightly removed. The Banggang Levee has been completely flooded. The dike of the Bian Levee is too low, so it was washed into by water. A certain part of the Yongning Levee in Sanshui County has collapsed. There are many ant nests in the Kuigang Levee, which is very dangerous. The Mian Levee has not been repaired for a long time, and there is a risk of leakage. The upper section of the Gaofeng Levee has collapsed, which is easy to repair, but the construction project of the lower section is quite large. A large section of the Magang Levee in Sihui County has been breached, and no one is currently responsible for repairing it. The flooding of the Jinfeng Levee is affected by other levees. As for the Tianhe Levee in Xinhui County, the base of the levee has also collapsed after this year's flood. (October 7th) The budget for the 24th year has been determined. The military expenditure will still be fully paid as before.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Province: Administrative Expenses Paid at 80% Discount: Budget for the 24th Year Has Been Determined: Military Expenses Will Still Be Fully Paid as Before</h3>
<p>Guangzhou Communication: The Guangdong Province's budget for the 24th year has recently been approved, with revenue of 52.68 million yuan and expenditures of 60.299522 million yuan. To make up for the shortfall, the province's administrative and educational expenses will be reduced to 80% of the original amount. Only military expenses will remain unchanged and will be paid in full. The provincial government has instructed its subordinate units to be informed of this, saying: "It is now reported by the Budget Review Committee on the 30th of August of the 24th year that the draft revenue and expenditure estimates for Guangdong Province for the 24th year of the Republic, as well as separate revenue and expenditure estimates, were previously forwarded to the meeting by the Guangdong Department of Finance. The Committee held seven meetings to review and determine the revenue budget to be 52,680,765 yuan and the expenditure budget to be 60,299,522 yuan. The difference between revenue and expenditure is 7,618,757 yuan. This shortfall was discussed at the seventh meeting of the Committee, and it was decided that, except for the second reserve fund, separate expenditures for pensions, special operations teams, anti-smuggling teams, ships, and the Han River Guard Battalion, which are military expenses, the rest will be paid at 80% of the approved amount, and each agency will allocate and revise the budget accordingly and record it. If calculated in this way, except for the full payment of the second item of reserve funds, separate expenditures for pensions, Han River Guard Battalion, special operations teams, anti-smuggling teams, patrol boats, factory construction machinery costs, and subsidies for the suppression of Communism in Jiangxi, totaling 34,687,920 yuan, there will be a remaining 25,611,602 yuan, which should be paid at 80%, which is 20,489,282 yuan. The total amount to be paid, including the full payment and the 80% payment, is 55,177,202 yuan, which is a reduction of 5,122,320 yuan compared to the approved amount. However, there is still a shortfall of 2,496,437 yuan compared to the expenditure. The shortfall in the national treasury's revenue and expenditure comparison has always been borrowed from the provincial treasury. The total budgeted expenditure for this year is over 58.11 million yuan, and after the full payment of over 49 million yuan for military agencies and pensions, if the remaining 9.1 million yuan is paid at 80%, it can reduce expenditure by over 1.82 million yuan per year, plus 25% for miscellaneous expenses, which is over 1.27 million yuan. According to this calculation, the total amount that the provincial treasury should borrow from the national treasury can be reduced accordingly, but there is still a shortfall of over 210,000 yuan. In addition, there are additional budgets of 200,239 yuan transferred from the Department of Finance for the establishment of the Provincial National Medical College and increased provincial agency budgets, which have not been reviewed. It is proposed that the government review and compile them again. The situation of reviewing the provincial local budget and separate estimates for this year, as well as the preliminary and reviewed revenue and expenditure estimates, the expenditure estimates for various unreviewed expenses, and the preliminary estimates and meeting minutes of various agencies, are hereby submitted to the government for review and approval. Please approve and implement, as it is for the public convenience. In addition, this document is borrowing the seal of the Department of Finance, which is hereby explained." Accordingly, it was submitted and reviewed in conjunction with the draft revenue and expenditure estimates for Guangdong Province for the 24th year of the Republic. It was then submitted to the 421st meeting of the 6th Committee of the Provincial Government, and it was resolved that "payment should be made at 80% of the approved budget, and those with self-determined reductions should still be paid at 80% of the reduced amount. School administrative expenses will be paid at 80%, and teacher salaries will be paid at 90%, starting from October 1." The relevant departments are ordered to comply and instruct their subordinate units to comply as well."</p>
<h3>Xie Weihai, a Military Officer from the Military Academy, Commits Suicide with His Entire Family by Drowning: The Couple and Their Children Took a Steamboat from Hefei to Wuhu: The Children Were Rescued, and a Suicide Note Stated It Was Due to Environmental Reasons</h3>
<p>Wuhu Communication: Xie Weihai, a military officer from the Central Military Academy's Training Corps, took leave at the end of last month to return to his hometown of Hefei, Anhui Province, to visit his relatives. After staying for a while, he brought his wife, Ms. Liu, his seven-year-old daughter, Xiaocuizi, and his four-year-old son, Xiaosheng, for a total of four family members. They traveled by land from home to Chaoxian County and boarded the Chaohu small steamer of the Daan Wheel Bureau to Wuhu. They sat in the fourth cabin of the same town tugboat towed by the steamer. At 6 pm on the 10th, when they arrived at the outer wharf of the Wuhu Yihai Wharf and were about to berth, Xie carried his son out of the cabin and wandered on the left side of the boat. He then turned to his wife and said, "The lights and shadows of the pagoda in Wuhu are very spectacular at night." Ms. Liu, curious, also carried her daughter close to the ship's side and looked towards the shore. Unexpectedly, Xie took advantage of Ms. Liu's unpreparedness and pushed Ms. Liu and her daughter into the river. He himself also jumped into the river with his son and committed suicide. When the ship's crew saw this, they immediately stopped and tried to rescue them. Because the current was swift, they only rescued the two children, a boy and a girl. Xie and Ms. Liu had already drowned, and their bodies drifted away with the water. After the ship docked, the police officers of the Public Security Bureau's water patrol team inspected the items left behind by Xie. In addition to a woolen military uniform, an armed belt, and a short knife, there were also two rattan boxes, a bundle of luggage, and a badge with the number 446 from the Training Corps of the Central Military Academy. The water police took the two children and the items to the water patrol team and reported it to the Public Security Bureau for instructions. His suicide note was written on the letterhead and envelope of the Training Corps of the Central Military Academy. He entrusted the ship to take care of the items on his behalf. The handwriting was in running script, and the writing was very neat. The shipowners' association has sent the letter to the water patrol team for preservation. The original text is as follows: "To the Director of the Steamer Bureau, I am committing suicide by drowning in the river this time from Chaoxian to Wuhu due to environmental reasons. As for the luggage and rattan boxes I left behind, I have already informed my family to send someone to pick them up. Please keep the original items temporarily. I am extremely grateful. Xie Weihai respectfully entrusts, Old - 9.12. My original residence is Dashe Village, east of Liujiaji, Dongxiang, Hefei." From his suicide note, it is said that he took this drastic measure due to environmental reasons. As for whether there are other reasons, it is unknown. It is heard that Xie's name is Jingtao, and he is only 30 years old. (11th)</p>

<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Wang Xiaolai reported, briefly stating: Since the national crisis, the people of the country have felt that our country's air defense is weak. Overseas Chinese and domestic citizens have requested the government to expand national defense and organize an aviation salvation association to gather the strength of the people to assist the government and strengthen air defense. The central government accepted the requests from all parties, handed over aviation [missing text] to summarize opinions, drafted methods, and sent personnel to Shanghai to contact leaders from all walks of life to organize the Aviation Salvation Association. It began operations in mid-September of the twelfth year. The central government, considering the serious relationship between aviation and national defense, required a comprehensive plan and unified methods, especially one that could be sustained for a long time. It specially requested Mayor Wu to consult with the preparation committee nearby and changed the name to the China Aviation Association. It was officially established on New Year's Day of the twenty-first year. Through the efforts of all parties, the call for aviation salvation spread throughout the country, and public sentiment was extremely enthusiastic. Plans were made to establish branch associations in various provinces, cities, and important towns. After stipulating the articles of association, it was submitted to the Executive Yuan, which instructed the provincial and municipal governments [missing text] to invite local chambers of commerce to invite local groups to initiate the organization. Those that have been established now include Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, and Hunan provinces, and other provinces and cities are actively preparing.

The general captain hired 441 leaders from all walks of life, organizations, and schools to serve as campaign captains and also hired deputy captains and members to assist in the campaign. The goal was to recruit 100,000 new members and solicit 1 million yuan in aviation salvation donations. Each team is working very hard, and more than 250 teams have reported their results successively. Other teams are in the process of collecting and reporting. In addition, a public solicitation of members, solicitation of donations from wealthy people, and collection of aviation salvation donations from various industries are being carried out.

<h3>Shanghai Telephone Bureau Agrees to Cancel Toll Charges; Both Parties to Use Direct Dialing; Currently Negotiating with Telephone Company</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications, responding to a letter from the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, stating that both the Chinese and foreign concession telephones are now equipped with automatic switchboards, and that Hounan and Chapei are close to the concessions, with direct calls facing no obstacles, while the concession telephone company inserts manual switching in the middle of the lines for toll recording, unfairly burdening citizens with overlapping fees for the same tool, which should be rectified immediately by canceling toll charges and switching to direct dialing, etc., the bureau immediately replied, stating, "After investigation, both this bureau and the Shanghai Telephone Company have converted to automatic telephones. Regarding communication between the two parties, direct dialing can be adopted to achieve smooth, rapid, and convenient communication. However, the company, based on the original temporary telephone contract, insists on calculating and charging fees in addition to the user's ordinary monthly rental, thus inserting manual switching devices between the lines, resulting in extremely slow communication. Both parties' users have voiced complaints. To improve communication and current conditions, the following two measures must be adopted: (1) The original temporary telephone contract stipulated a charge of five cents per call between the two parties, which should be simultaneously announced and canceled by the Shanghai Telephone Company and this bureau. (2) Communication between the two parties should be immediately switched to direct dialing for automatic connection, to avoid the delay of manual switching procedures. In addition to this bureau negotiating based on the above principles, the matter concerns changes to the contract's content. This bureau's efforts are limited, and we fear it may not be easy to achieve the goal in a short time to meet public expectations. We hope your association will jointly advocate for this."</p>
<h3>The Municipal Rent Reduction Association Submits Another Petition to the Municipal Government, Requesting a Prompt Order for a 40% Rent Reduction, and Elects Representatives to Petition in Beijing on a Set Date</h3>
<p>Da Gong She reports that the Municipal Rent Reduction Committee, in an effort to realize a 40% rent reduction, has scheduled representatives to petition in Beijing on the 15th of this month. Yesterday, they also submitted another petition to the municipal government, requesting a prompt order for rent reduction measures. The original petition stated, "Submitting this petition to revive the prosperity of Shanghai's market, we earnestly request your review and approval of a clear order for a 40% rent reduction. The occurrence of the rent reduction movement is based on the sluggishness of the market. Since the Shanghai War, the organizations of rent reduction and exemption associations have existed for a long time. Landlords and tenants have gone to extremes, and the severity of the situation is no less than today. Fortunately, your government announced rent exemption measures, and all sectors believed that the market would soon recover, and the boiling rent reduction movement immediately dissipated. However, four years have passed since the Shanghai War, and not only has the vitality not recovered, but it has also been hit by floods and droughts in various provinces, rural bankruptcy, the looming war clouds around the world, and the outflow of cash, resulting in a shortage of funds in Shanghai, economic decline, and market depression, almost collapsing. As a result, the number of unemployed people is increasing daily, the purchasing power of citizens is gradually decreasing, and industrial and commercial operations are even more affected, with liquidations and bankruptcies occurring every day. To seek revival, we must get to the root of the problem and reduce citizens' wasteful spending to increase their purchasing power. Things that are not suitable, are wasteful, things that are not in line with market prices, are wasteful. It is found that the biggest expenditure of Shanghai citizens is rent, and the catastrophic drop in house and land prices is a fact that cannot be denied. Today's rent is out of line with market prices and is wasteful. Therefore, reducing rent is the most important and urgent problem to be solved in order to revive Shanghai and prosper the market. For example, if the average monthly rent is reduced by one yuan per person, the total amount for the entire Shanghai area would be over sixteen million yuan annually. With this huge amount of money circulating, the revival of Shanghai and the prosperity of the market can be expected, and even the relief of rural areas will benefit. Is this not the urgent task of today? It is heard that a certain special district city government advocates rent reduction for disaster relief, expressing considerable sympathy, achieving two goals with one move, who would say it is not appropriate? As for the reasons for requesting an order for a 40% rent reduction and the four legal bases, they are presented below. The collection of rent by real estate merchants is like the collection of interest on loans. The standard of rent is calculated based on the total value of land price and construction cost, with an interest rate of 10% or 8% being stipulated as the net profit for the rent. Rent is the interest on real estate. Therefore, a 40% rent reduction is also a 40% reduction in interest, which is very clear. Although rents vary from location to location, the standard interest rate is the same. A 40% rent reduction seems quite fair and more balanced. Moreover, there are explicit legal provisions for increasing or decreasing rent. Whether the value of real estate has risen or fallen in recent times does not need much explanation. Nanjing Road and surrounding areas are the most prosperous areas in this city, and land prices have fallen drastically by half, yet there are still no buyers. The situation in remote areas can be imagined. Therefore, a 40% rent reduction is in line with both law and sentiment. Furthermore, the number of vacant houses in Shanghai has recently increased daily, and the market is even more depressed. Vacant houses are lined up almost 40% of all housing. If rent can be reduced by 40%, so that there are no vacant houses in the city, the income of landlords will not actually change. For example, the new building of Hardoon &amp; Co. on Nanjing Road has remained unrented for two to four years. The original rent was set at 1,000 taels, but has now been changed to 1,000 yuan, with a further discount (i.e., 35% of original). Only after such reductions is there hope of renting it out. This proves that the rent reduction movement is indeed a timely need. It is a pity that evidence of the decline in real estate is difficult to collect. It is suggested that the government use its power to investigate the ratio of present and past mortgage values with financial institutions that hold mortgaged properties, which can also prove this point. In summary, we earnestly request your government to weigh the considerations and promptly announce a 40% rent reduction and order that all the money reduced in the previous few months be used for disaster relief, in order to revive Shanghai's market and benefit the disaster-stricken people. Society will be fortunate, and the citizens will be grateful. Respectfully submitted to Wu, the Mayor of the Shanghai Municipal Government, by the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee."</p>

<h3>Yesterday, the Second Special District District Court Heard the Case of Gu Zhuxuan; Closing Arguments Concluded; Forensic Medical Examination Showed Good Mental Condition; Inmates Appeared in Court to Testify Separately; Tang's Sister Requested Justice for Her Brother; Closing Arguments Concluded; Verdict to Be Announced on the 18th</h3>
<p>The case of Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World, a native of Dinghai, who was assassinated on June 18, 1933, is now based on the report to the Police Department by Zhao Guangfu, a native of Yangzhou, and Zhang Tinggui (also known as Xiao Sizi), a native of Funing, who are already serving indefinite sentences, stating that the assassination was instigated by Gu Zhuxuan (i.e., Boss Gu Si), the owner of the Tianchan Stage. Therefore, the Police Department requested the Second Special Court to issue a warrant. On the 10th of last month, Chinese and Western detectives from the Public Concession Police arrested Gu and brought him to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. After the investigation was concluded, he was prosecuted according to Articles 29 and 271 of the Criminal Law for instigating murder.</p>
<p>Prosecution Instituted</p>
<p>Guo Tang Youmei, the younger sister of the victim Tang Jiapeng, also appointed a lawyer to file an ancillary private lawsuit, seeking compensation for damages. On the 27th of last month, Criminal Judge Wang Gangxu, together with Prosecutor Wang Ren, held a hearing and brought in the accusers Zhao and Zhang, as well as Wang Xinggao, who was suspected of being involved in the murder of Tang but had not been confirmed, and Xue Zhenyi, a prisoner involved in another case and implicated in this case, for interrogation. After the interrogation, the court adjourned and set a new date because the defendant's defense lawyer argued that the defendant Gu Zhuxuan was suffering from mental illness, which was inconvenient for treatment in custody, and requested bail for interrogation. The court ordered a</p>
<p>Re-examination for Assessment</p>
<p>In the case file, the court had already engaged Dr. Dali (transliteration), a German doctor and well-known mental illness expert in Shanghai, together with the court's forensic doctors Wei Ligong and Jiang Xuan, to go to Guangci Hospital on the morning of the 2nd of this month to examine Gu Zhuxuan's condition in detail. Both parties submitted diagnostic assessment reports in Chinese and English. The criminal court translated the English assessment report into Chinese and, after reviewing it, scheduled a hearing to continue the trial at 2:00 p.m. yesterday. Because this case attracted the attention of all sectors of Shanghai, the courtroom was crowded during the previous two hearings, resulting in poor order in the courtroom last time. Therefore, this time, in order to maintain court order and avoid crowding, the court did not announce the date of the hearing in advance. It was not until the subpoenas were delivered the day before yesterday that the news spread.</p>
<p>Yesterday Afternoon</p>
<p>At 1:00 p.m., the Police Department dispatched dozens of reserve Chinese constables and detectives to guard the entrance to the court and the courtroom to maintain order. Ding, a Chinese bailiff from the court, together with the guarding police officers, checked the attendance certificates at the entrance to the court, and those with tickets were seated in the courtroom in order. Those without tickets were turned away. This time, more than 100 family members and friends of Gu attended the hearing, a significant decrease from the previous number. At 2:25 p.m., Criminal Judge Wang Gangxu, along with Judges Xiong and Ping Zhang Chaozuo, Clerk Zheng Rong, and Prosecutor Wang Ren, arrived at Criminal Court No. 1 to hold a collegial trial. Lawyers Gu Shouxi and Fei Xizhen represented the Police Department, and the defendant's defense lawyers Wu Kaisheng, with attorneys Bi, Lin Dawen, and Wang Shizong and Zhou Yongding, who represented the victim's family in the private lawsuit, took their seats in turn, bowing respectfully to the court. After the court opened, the</p>
<p>Atmosphere in the Courtroom</p>
<p>Became solemn. The court ordered the defendant Gu Zhuxuan, supported by two bailiffs, to stand in the defendant's dock, appearing dejected. The defendant's defense lawyer stated to the court that the defendant was ill and requested that he be granted a seat. The court granted the request for him to sit and wait. Gu was wearing a navy blue wool gabardine robe, with a shaven head and black satin shoes. The judge first questioned Gu, who stated that he was 50 years old, from Jiangsu Province, residing at No. 9 Yonghe Lane, North Xizang Road, and was a businessman. After the questioning, Gu sat down. The judge then summoned Tang Youmei, the sister of the plaintiff Tang Jiapeng, who stated that she was 39 years old, from Dinghai, and that Tang Jiapeng was her brother. "I live with my brother. My brother was often depressed. When I asked him, he said that he might have trouble, which means, Gu Si." Recently saw the Da Wan Bao report, and seeing that it was Gu Si who ordered the assassination of my brother, my brother died a miserable death, I ask for justice for my brother," the report finished, the judge told her to sit down, then handed the forensic examination</p>
<p>Chinese and English Versions</p>
<p>To the attorneys from the police department and the defense attorneys. The attorney did not comment, (The main point was, that at 9am on the 2nd, at Guanzi Hospital, the examination was done, the defendant's nervous system was normal, polite to people, verbally tested and clearly answered, and is not currently mentally disoriented). And said to the defendant, the judge said, "Our court's forensic doctors have examined your illness and determined that your nervous system is currently very good and there are no abnormalities."</p>
<p>Gu Zhuxuan Answered</p>
<p>"The doctor came to see me, but I still can't eat solid food. I eat some porridge every day and take medicine every day. I feel very uncomfortable now." He also said, "There is a prisoner named Zhu Jincheng in the prison who told me in the hospital how they (referring to Zhao Guangfu and Zhang Tinggui) were trying to extort money from me. Tang Jiapeng and I were like brothers. Why would I want to kill him? I really have no involvement whatsoever. If the judge finds even a little bit of evidence that I was involved, I am willing to accept the punishment." Asked, "Do you know Zhao Guangfu?" He answered, "I don't know Zhao and Zhang. I have no grievances with them. They are trying to extort money from me." Asked, "They sent you letters. You said you didn't see them. What would you do if you had seen them?" He answered, "If I had seen the letters, they would just be asking me for money. Then I would give them some as if I were doing a good deed. But their family members didn't come, so I couldn't send the money into the prison." Asked, "Did you see Xue Zhenyi's letter?" He answered, "I saw it at first, but I didn't pay attention to it because I had no involvement whatsoever." The judge</p>
<p>Ordered Zhao Guangfu</p>
<p>To be brought to the court and asked, "Did you report Gu Zhuxuan to the police of your own volition, or were you instigated by someone?" He answered, "It was my own volition." Asked, "Why didn't you say it after the third trial?" He answered, "I wanted to say it during the second trial, but Xue Zhenyi told me not to say it, saying that no matter what, they would find a way to get me out. If they couldn't get me out in the second trial, they would definitely get me out in the Supreme Court, and that they would hire a lawyer to defend me. So I didn't say it. Later, both the second and third trials were rejected. I saw that the judgment did not hire a lawyer to defend me, and that the lawyer was appointed." Asked, "Who invited you to kill Tang Jiapeng?" He answered, "Zhou Ermu, that is, Zhou Mingxiang, came to my house on June 16 and asked me to go out. On the way, he kept talking. When we got to the Laohuzao, Qi Qifu and Gu Dunyang were there, as well as someone I didn't know. Later, we met at the Renhe Teahouse, where Wang Xinggao was drinking tea. At 11:00, we went to Room 208 of the Asia Hotel. When we entered the room, no one was there. Later, three or four people came. There were seven or eight people in total. Gu came in last. After speaking to everyone, Wang Xinggao pointed to Gu and said to me, 'This is Boss Gu Si.' Gu then said, 'Be bold and do it. After it's done, I'll give you a reward of 10,000 yuan.' Zhou Ermu told me at the Laohuzao that it was Boss Gu Si's business, and that he would take responsibility. At that time, Zhou only told me to kill the manager of the Great World, without specifying Tang Jiapeng's name. I only went to the Asia Hotel once. I don't know who invited Zhou Ermu. Zhang Xiaosizi and I met in front of the Laohuzao in front of the Great World. They kept going out to look for the rickshaw delivering the gun. Later, I wrote a letter and sent it to the Tianchan Stage, to Gu Zhuxuan, asking him for the reward. People die for wealth, and birds die for food. I was deceived by money and committed the crime. At that time, it was said that Zhou Qifu, Gu Dunyang, Zhang Xiaosi, and I would each get 10,000 yuan. As a result, I didn't get the money, and Gu didn't help and ignored me, so I reported him. I have no hatred or grievance against Gu. I wanted to ask him for money. Xue Zhenyi spoke to me during the appeal period at the Third Branch of the Detention Center. The rest of my testimony is the same as before. I also deny writing a note to Xue Zhenyi in prison. I also don't know the prisoner Zhang Chenliang's words."</p>
<p>Asked, "Gu Zhuxuan</p>
<p>Zhao Guangfu testified that he saw you at the Asia Hotel." Gu answered, "The Asia Hotel accountant, accompanied by a Western detective, came to Guangci Hospital to identify me. They all said they had never seen me or knew me." Asked, "Zhao Guangfu, what was Gu wearing when you saw him at the Asia Hotel?" He answered, "He was wearing a gray long gown." At this point, the attorney from the Police Department stated to the court that the police had summoned the current manager of the Asia Hotel and the former employees, and requested that they be questioned. Defendant Wu Kaisheng's attorney requested the court to question Zhao Guangfu about the layout of the Asia Hotel's rooms, etc. The judge</p>
<p>Ordered Zhang Tinggui</p>
<p>To be brought to the court. According to his testimony, "On June 11, I met Wang Jinkui at the intersection of Changan Road and Hengfeng Road in Zhabei. He invited me to a teahouse and told me that he needed my help, saying that an enemy had eaten bad food and that Tang Jiapeng had swallowed money, and asked me to help. I replied that I couldn't help. Wang said he would talk about it again the next day and then said it was Boss Gu Si's business. The next day, Zhou Qifu brought me to Room 208 of the Asia Hotel. Including me, there were eight people in total. Three people left, and there were five people left: Wang Jinkui, Zhou Qifu, Gu Dunyang, etc. Wang and Zhou introduced me to Boss Gu Si, who was wearing a black long gown. I then saw Gu and Wang talking secretly. Gu took out a pistol and handed it to Wang. He didn't say anything to me. After Gu left, Wang said to me, 'That's the matter. After Tang Jiapeng of the Great World is killed, there will be no less money.' He also said that he (referring to Gu) could get things done in court. At that time, it was said that each of the four people would get 10,000 yuan. Afterwards, Wang Jinkui and Xu Fubao gave me 60 yuan and told me to go back to my hometown and wait for them to give me the rest of the money when I came back. I only went to the Asia Hotel once." Asked, "You said before that the reward was 3,000 yuan. What was that about?" He answered, "Wang Jin told me that I could find a job or do business in Shanghai, otherwise he would give me 3,000 yuan." Asked, "Why didn't you say anything when Zhao Guangfu reported Wang Xinggao before?" He answered, "I was in prison at that time, and Zhao was in the detention center. I didn't know about it. I didn't see Wang Xinggao and Zhao Guangfu when I saw Gu at the Asia Hotel on June 13. I also don't know Wang Xinggao." Asked, "Gu Zhuxuan, according to Zhang Tinggui, you were seen at the Asia Hotel." Gu answered, "They are clearly trying to extort money from me. How could I hire such people to kill someone? Besides, Tang Jiapeng and I were good friends. Why would I want to kill him? I heard at Guangci Hospital that prisoner Zhu Jincheng told me that they (referring to Zhao and Zhang) were trying to extort money from me. They had been organizing it since June, and everyone in the prison knew about it." The judge then</p>
<p>Summoned Fu Qingrong,</p>
<p>A receptionist, and Sun Qiuping, the manager, from the Asia Hotel. After ordering the witnesses to make an oath, according to their testimony, "I have been working as a receptionist at the Asia Hotel since June 16, 1933, until July 8 of this year, when I was replaced. Room 208 is on the second floor. All the previous records were taken away by the former old staff. I don't know the defendant in this case (referring to Gu) or the two prisoners (referring to Zhao and Zhang). I have never seen the defendant come here. A few days ago, a Western detective accompanied me to the hospital to see them." Sun testified, "I took over the Asia Hotel on July 8, 1933. The former owner was from Guangdong. All the previous records, etc., were taken away. I don't know anything about the previous matters." Then asked, "Zhao Guangfu, why did you testify before that you saw Gu Zhuxuan at the Da Jiangnan Restaurant in the Public Concession?" He answered, "I don't know the way, and I didn't know that the Asia Hotel was in the French Concession. A detective took me to see it, and I then confirmed that it was the Asia Hotel." Asked, "Zhang Tinggui, did you submit a petition to the Third Branch of the High Court requesting a retrial?" He answered, "Because I heard that Zhao Guangfu had reported Wang Xinggao, I requested a retrial accordingly, but I don't know the details." Asked, "Zhao Guangfu, in your complaint against Gu Zhuxuan, did you say that Wang Jinkui was Chu Wang Xinggao?" He answered, "I didn't say that." The defendant's lawyer</p>
<p>Stated, "When I, the lawyer, reviewed the case file at your court, I copied Zhao's complaint, which stated that Wang Jinkui was Wang Xinggao. Now Zhao Guangfu testified in court that Wang was two people." He then submitted the copy to the court. At this point, the judge ordered the clerk to issue a warrant and send bailiffs to the Second Special Prison to bring</p>
<p>Essential Witnesses</p>
<p>In the case, prisoners Zhang Daichuan, Zhang Chenliang, Liu Yimin, Wu Siting, and Zhu Jincheng, to the court. First, Zhang Daichuan was questioned (37 years old, from Yancheng, the son of a lane sweeper from Run'an Lane, Ximen Road, originally sentenced to 14 years for colluding to tie up the son of Zou Yushun in the lane and demanding a ticket, but the sentence was changed to life imprisonment). He testified, "I don't know Xue Zhenyi. I got to know Zhao Guangfu in the detention center. Zhang Tinggui was locked up on the second floor." Asked, "Did Zhao Guangfu give you a note to hand over to Xue Zhenyi?" Zhang answered, "After the new criminal law was promulgated in July of this year, because Xue understood the law, I asked Xue about my own case, asking if there was a way to reduce my sentence by a few years. When I was discussing this with Xue, Zhao told Xue, 'Please help me. I don't know if they said 30/70 split, or 40/60 split, I don't know the details." Asked, "Zhao, did you say this to Xue?" Zhao denied it and accused Zhang of talking in his sleep. Next, Zhang Chenliang was questioned. Asked, "Did Zhao ask you to give a note to Xue Zhenyi?" Zhang testified, "About two months ago, when I was washing the floor, Zhao asked me, No. 393, gave me something square wrapped in newspaper, and ordered me to give it to Xue. Xue opened it and saw something written in pencil, but I don't know what it was about. Xue didn't explain it after reading it." Zhao still denied that he asked anyone to give the</p>
<p>note to Xue. Next, Liu Yimin, (an accomplice of the executed bandit Zheng Tangsheng, originally sentenced to death, but the sentence was changed to life imprisonment), testified, "I knew Xue in the detention center. Zhao Guangfu was a native of Yangzhou and was locked up in the same cell as me. He was very poor and wore my clothes. After Zhao received the judgment, he told me that he had been wrongly imprisoned for killing someone, because he was deceived by Zhou Ermu and Wang Jinkui. Because we were from the same hometown, I asked Xue to write an appeal petition for him. I also paid for the petition." Zhao testified, "I didn't ask Xue to write the petition for my appeal. I asked a prisoner in the same cell,</p>
<p>Liu Guobao</p>
<p>to write it." Next, Wu Shaoting (involved in the same case as Liu Yimin), testified, "Zhao Guangfu was in the same cell as me in the detention center. I asked Liu Guobao to write the petition for Zhao's appeal to the Supreme Court." Finally, Zhu Jincheng (involved in the Wei Tingrong kidnapping case), testified, "I don't know Gu Zhuxuan. I met him in Guangci Hospital, where I was being treated. I heard people say that he was Boss Gu Si. Zhao Guangfu and I were in the same cell in the detention center before, but not after entering prison. Around the Dragon Boat Festival this year, one day, I had visitors, and Zhao also had visitors, an old woman, said to be Zhao's mother-in-law. I heard Zhao say to his mother-in-law that he was going to sue Boss Gu Si. The old woman said to Zhao, 'You can't touch him.' Zhao said he would definitely sue and said to his mother-in-law hatefully, 'Don't come to see me anymore.' Later, I was in charge of the library. One day, when I went upstairs to collect books, Zhao showed me a complaint petition. I glanced at it and asked Zhao, 'You're going to sue Boss Gu Si?' I advised him not to sue. He said he had to sue and said that it was very hard to be in prison, and that the Jiangbei gang (referring to Gu's men) were not willing to help me. He was a piece of meat on the chopping board, to be chopped.' Soon I learned in the detention center that Wang Xinggao had been caught. Everyone in the prison thought Zhao's behavior was unjust. I don't know the outside affairs and can't talk nonsense." The judge confronted Zhao with Zhu's testimony. Zhao claimed that Zhu's words were wrong, that only his wife had visited him, and that he had not said those words. Before Wang Xinggao's appeal hearing, someone in cell No. 268 came to the fourth floor and called me. He said that Gu had written a letter to him, asking him to ask me what the purpose was. I replied that I had no hatred or grievance against Gu Si and Tang Jiapeng, that I had been deceived by money and imprisoned without getting the money. He knew that Zhu Jincheng and I had been in the same cell and knew each other, so he asked Zhu to speak to me, and said that it would be good to give me 1,000 yuan, but because Zhu wanted to deduct the double hats, I refused. The judge asked again, regarding Zhu and Zhao's words, asking who the prisoner in cell No. 268 was. Zhu answered, "Zhao misunderstood. I have no hatred or grievance against Zhao, and I am not related to Gu. I heard Xu Xiaokai in Guangci Hospital say that Gu Si had come in, so I remembered the previous situation and said it." When the judge questioned the prisoner witnesses, he ordered them to take an oath first, and then questioned them. After the questioning, when he ordered the prisoner witnesses to be taken down, Wu Shaoting suddenly</p>
<p>Loudly to the Court</p>
<p>Stated that he wanted to declare to the court that he had just learned the reason for being brought to court today was because of Gu Zhuxuan's matter, and that everyone in the prison knew about the extortion of Gu Zhuxuan. He asked to question them to find out the truth. The court rebuked Wu, saying that he was brought to court by the court for questioning, not regarding Zhao's matter. The police then took Wu away. The court then had Xue Zhenyi brought to the court. According to his testimony, Zhao Guangfu begged me to write two letters to Gu Zhuxuan to ask for money, so that he (referring to Gu) could send the money to his (referring to Zhao's) family. So I wrote them for him. Gu and I are colleagues in the Red Cross. I was the captain of the rescue team, and Gu was a special member. I personally saw Gu donate 200,000 yuan and do good deeds. I couldn't bear Zhao's prosecution of Gu, so I agreed to write the letters. Zhao wanted to extort money from Gu and was organized. Please ask who wrote the complaint petition against Gu? After the new criminal law came into effect this year, Zhao told me that the complaint had been sent to the court and was not being heard, and asked me to help him, asking me to admit that I was Gu's disciple and had mediated for them, promising to give me 30% of the reward after the matter was settled. At this point, the judge ordered the bailiffs to go to the prison and bring the prisoner No. 268 to the court. According to the testimony, his surname was</p>
<h3>Postal Bureau Grand Robbery Case: Re-enactment of the Robbery, with Court Prosecutor Personally Inspecting the Scene, Surrounded by a Large Crowd</h3>
<p>The Shanghai General Post Office experienced a major robbery on September 9th of this year, with over ninety-one thousand dollars in cash stolen. The robbers also shot and killed Yuan Bingshu, an experienced clerk from the Savings and Remittance Bureau who was escorting the money, and a bodyguard named Lü Ruilin, while injuring bodyguard Zhou Yucheng with gunfire. Subsequently, the police authorities successively apprehended multiple suspects, including the monk Wu Kong, and handed them over to the First Special District Local Court for interrogation and investigation. Details of these events have been reported previously. We now learn that bodyguard Zhou Yucheng, who was wounded by gunfire, has been hospitalized at the Tung Jen Hospital for a month. The two gunshot wounds on his left arm have been carefully treated by doctors and are showing signs of improvement. However, the bullet that struck the left side of his abdomen did not exit his body and remains lodged inside. Surgery will likely be required after a considerable period to remove the bullet. Zhou's mental state has recently cleared up. Therefore, the prosecutor Jiang Shuzi of the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court, who is hearing the case, along with a court clerk, the police attorney Zhishan, and Inspector Chang, personally visited Tung Jen Hospital in the afternoon of the previous day. At Zhou's bedside, they questioned him in detail about the circumstances of the robbery and murder. According to Zhou, the robbers first fired at him before shooting the veteran clerk and others. After questioning him, Prosecutor Jiang advised him to rest and recuperate. He then drove to the General Post Office on North Szechuan Road, accompanied by Postmaster General Chapin, Deputy Postmaster General Tao Gonghuan, senior postal officials, and witnesses to the robbery. They went to the scene of the crime, brought a vehicle used for transporting money, and re-enacted various aspects of the robbery, including how the robbers seized the money, committed murder, obtained their loot, and escaped by car. For a time, a large and very crowded crowd stood outside the post office watching. The re-enactment lasted for about two hours and Prosecutor Jiang shook hands with the Postmaster before returning to the court to use the information gathered from the re-enactment as a reference for future interrogations.</p>
<h3>Suspicious Postal Sacks: Postal Robbery Case Impacts Rural Farmers</h3>
<p>Since the occurrence of the major robbery at the Shanghai General Post Office, police authorities in both the Chinese and International Settlements have been conducting strict investigations. Among those who were detained due to suspicion but later released after questioning by the court, there have been quite a few individuals. Now, there is Wang Jinsheng (approximately 40 years old), a resident of the Gao Zhai area, about [unclear] miles from Gaoqiao Town in Pudong, who has been a carpenter by trade. He now farms in his village to make a living, is illiterate, works hard, and manages to make ends meet. After each autumn harvest, he puts his "flower-clothed rice" into hemp sacks and carries them to Gaoqiao Town to sell. Several years ago, someone mistakenly took one of his hemp sacks. Wang and his family, being illiterate farmers, were unaware that the sack, which had the words "Post Office" written on it, belonged to the government. Wang continued to use it as usual. This year, the General Post Office sent personnel to establish a branch office in Gaoqiao Town. Last month, Wang again loaded the hemp sack with "flower-clothed rice" and sold it in front of the Gaoqiao Town Post Office branch. A postal worker noticed the sack and asked Wang about its origin in detail. However, Wang was stubborn by nature and spoke rudely, leading to a police report. Wang was taken to the police station. Because Wang could not prove the source of the hemp sack, [he was helped] by the merchants and educational circles of Gaoqiao who came forward to testify [that] Wang [was] a law-abiding farmer, but because the case was of great importance, he was still sent to the Shanghai Public Security Bureau and transferred to the General Post Office for consultation with the police department. After Wang was taken for investigation, although he was not related to the major robbery case, the suspicion of using a post office bag was difficult to deny. Yesterday he was sent back to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and transferred to the District Court Prosecutor's Office for interrogation and handling.</p>
<h3>Industrial and Commercial Revival Association Training Group Hosts Lecturers of Research Class</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee, after submitting reports and recommendations on issues such as increasing funding and handling accounting guidelines which were drafted by the committee, has attracted great attention from all parties. The Shanghai Banking Association has already sent a letter to the Revival Association requesting the report and recommendations for distribution to its member banks for research. The Shanghai Bank has also sent the report and recommendations to its local branches to gather opinions. The Training Group of the Revival Association hosted a dinner on the previous evening at 6:00 PM in the meeting room of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce for the prospective lecturers of the Practical Industrial and Commercial Problems Research Class to discuss the schedule and distribution of topics. Attendees included Pan Gongzhan, Wang Yansong (represented by Mao Zhenchu), Zhang Naiqi, Yang Yinfu, Xu Yongzuo, Xie Lin, Xu Peikun, Tu Zhezhen, Pan Yangyao, Zheng Chengqing, Chen Xiaodie, Chen Diewxian (represented by Chen Xiaodie), Zhai Kegong, Wu Sheng, Cheng Shouzhong, Li Hongshou, Luo Qinghua, Jin Runxiang, Xu Guanqun, He Qingru, Lu Qian Yangchi, Xu Baiyi, Tang Yan, Li Wenjie, Ren Chenping, and others. First, Luo Qinghua, Director of the Training Group, delivered a speech on behalf of Wang Yansong, Chairman of the Committee, stating that Shanghai has experienced unprecedented economic terror, and various industries are in a state of disrepair. Based on its duties and the resolutions of the Delegates' Assembly, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce has established the Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee to study the plans for industrial and commercial revival. It is believed that the causes of China's current economic decline are multifaceted and have accumulated over time. Such as the long-standing huge trade deficit, the United States' purchase of silver, the impact of the global recession, the frequent occurrence of floods and droughts, the loss of the four northeastern provinces, the banditry in the provinces along the Yangtze River, and the heavy losses of the Shanghai war, all of which are major causes. The lack of improvement in industrial and commercial personnel and their adherence to old ways are also internal major factors. Therefore, to revive industry and commerce, one must first seek the soundness of the industry and commerce itself. This is what is called self-reliance. Therefore, research on personnel improvement has become the unavoidable task of the Training Group. After several meetings, it is proposed to set up a practical research class on industrial and commercial issues, and it is agreed to first invite industrial and commercial management, product promotion, and accounting management. The three classes enable the on-the-job staff of various industrial and commercial enterprises to conduct in-depth research on the integration of various theories and their practical experience in service, so that they can achieve twice the result with half the effort in improving personnel.

<h3>Long-Distance Bus on the Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway Robbed in Songjiang Territory; Over Twenty Passengers Lost About a Thousand Gold, the Bandits Spoke with a Local Accent and Were Well-Organized</h3>
<p>The Shanghai-Hangzhou Highway is a vital transportation route between Shanghai and various coastal towns in Zhejiang Province. Since the construction of the highway and the operation of long-distance buses, travel has become convenient. The security of the road is usually very tight. However, on the afternoon of the previous day (the 11th), a joint passenger vehicle operating between Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, and Shanghai City was suddenly robbed by bandits in the Yanggong Temple area of Songjiang County. The property of over twenty passengers on board was lost, amounting to approximately one thousand gold. Fortunately, no passengers were kidnapped. After the incident, the highway authorities reported the incident to military and police agencies, requesting a thorough investigation. A reporter from the Daily News happened to be on the bus from Jinshanwei to Shanghai and recorded the details of the robbery as follows. The joint long-distance bus between Pinghu County, Zhejiang Province, and Shanghai operates four times a day. The second joint bus on the 10th departed from Pinghu at 1:00 PM. At 2:25 PM, it passed Jinshanwei Station in Songjiang County. As it drove to the Yanggong Temple area, about two kilometers from Jinshanwei Station, two bandits pretending to be passengers suddenly stood up from their seats, each pulling out a pistol and loudly ordering the passengers not to move. One bandit jumped to the front of the bus, forcing the driver to stop. At that moment, four or five bandits who had been lying in ambush in the fields next to the road jumped out, distributed themselves in front and behind the bus, and cut the tires of the bus with sharp knives. They then robbed the passengers of their belongings, taking about twenty minutes before fleeing.</p>
<p>Reported for Investigation</p>
<p>After the robbery, the bus could not move because the tires were punctured. The driver immediately tried to report the incident to Jinshanwei. A rescue bus was dispatched from Nanchiao Station to transport the passengers to Shanghai. The highway authorities were immediately informed of the robbery, and the report was forwarded to the Songjiang County Government for a thorough investigation. As for the robbery itself, the bandits were well-organized, all carried pistols, and spoke with what appeared to be a local accent.</p>
<p>Passenger Losses</p>
<p>Over twenty passengers were robbed, with losses estimated at around a thousand gold. Among them, a passenger named Zhang suffered the greatest loss, losing his gold watch, clothing, and approximately two hundred yuan in cash. The other passengers were robbed of amounts ranging from a few yuan to several tens of yuan, one by one, without exception. Even the relatively intact clothing on their bodies was taken. Fortunately, there were no injuries or kidnappings. Among the passengers were three archaeologists who were visiting the relics of Kangwang Ancient City in Qijia Mound, Songjiang County, and also suffered an undeserved disaster.</p>
<p>Suspects Arrested</p>
<p>It is also learned that after the bandits left with their loot, the Jinshanwei Station reported the incident to the security team stationed there, which went to the scene and arrested a suspect named Ma Zixiangsheng, who confessed that tailor Atu and Zhu A'de were involved in the case and that he had not joined them. The security team then arrested the two suspects and is currently conducting a thorough investigation.</p>
<h3>Municipal Public Security Bureau Regulations: Measures to Restrict Smokers Quitting on Their Own; Complete Abstinence Within One Month of Starting to Quit; Examination by Designated Hospital After Abstinence</h3>
<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau approved the Municipal Government's extension of the deadline for self-reporting by smokers, it has continued to investigate smokers and encourage them to register for licenses. Recently, smokers have been more enthusiastic about complying with the regulations for obtaining licenses and requesting to quit smoking. The number of registered license holders has exceeded 10,000, and the number of people requesting free smoking cessation has reached more than 1,000, with remarkable results. However, there are still some unregistered smokers who claim to quit smoking on their own and are unwilling to register for licenses or be sent to smoking cessation hospitals. The Public Security Bureau believes that the purpose of registering and issuing licenses is to urge smokers to quit smoking as soon as possible. Smokers who voluntarily quit smoking are not only permitted by law but also expected by the government. This phenomenon is very good. However, whether smokers who claim to quit on their own can actually quit is unknown. If there is no way to verify and no restrictions are put in place, it is feared that cunning people will use the name of quitting to evade obtaining licenses and secretly continue to smoke opium. To prevent such a situation, the following measures have been formulated: Smokers who quit on their own must be registered separately by the police stations of each sub-bureau and reported to the bureau. It is stipulated that smokers who quit on their own must completely abstain from smoking within one month from the date of application to quit. After quitting, they must undergo an examination by a hospital designated by the Health Bureau to confirm that they are addiction-free and obtain a certificate, which must be submitted to the relevant sub-bureau within a limited time. A written guarantee that they will not smoke again must be submitted to the General Bureau for record-keeping. If the Public Security Bureau deems that there is suspicion, falsification, or discovery that they have resumed smoking after quitting, they may be sent to the Municipal Temporary Drug Rehabilitation Center for verification at any time. If addiction is verified, they will be given the same punishment as smokers sent by the bureau for relapse after quitting smoking. The above measures to restrict smokers quitting on their own have been communicated to all sub-bureaus for compliance and implementation, and the Health Bureau has been requested by letter to designate several hospitals to be responsible for the verification work of whether smokers who claim to quit on their own are addicted to smoking or not.</p>
<h3>Shanghai National Products Company Applies for Mediation with the Chamber of Commerce</h3>
<p>After the Shanghai National Products Joint-Stock Company suspended business, the shareholders' meeting elected liquidators to handle the liquidation. Now, because the company's assets can no longer pay off its debts, the liquidators Hong Yanbin, Wang Jian'e, Zou Shengsan, Zhang Zilian, and Zhang Henghai have applied to the Chamber of Commerce for mediation. The Chamber of Commerce has replied with a letter stating that it will handle the matter in accordance with the law. Here are the two letters:</p>
<p>Letter from the Liquidators</p>
<p>We are submitting this letter to request mediation. The liquidators have been elected by the company's shareholders' meeting to handle the liquidation of the Shanghai National Products Joint-Stock Company (hereinafter referred to as "the Company") and have been approved and recorded by the First Special District Local Court. However, after reviewing the company's assets and liabilities, it is clear that there is a reason for inability to pay off debts. Therefore, in accordance with Articles 7 and 41 of the Bankruptcy Law, we hereby request your Chamber to investigate and approve the mediation. We would be most grateful.</p>
<p>Reply from the Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>We received your letter on the 11th of this month regarding the liquidation of the Shanghai National Products Joint-Stock Company. After reviewing the company's assets and liabilities, it is clear that there is a reason for the inability to pay off debts. In accordance with the provisions of Article 41 of the Bankruptcy Law, you have applied to the Chamber for mediation. If the company has not yet filed a bankruptcy petition with the court as of now, and has not filed a petition for mediation with the court, the Chamber may consider your liquidators' request for mediation in accordance with the provisions of Article 41 of the Law. We still hope that you will immediately submit the documents that should be submitted in accordance with Article 7 of the Bankruptcy Law to the Association for discussion and decision.</p>
<h3>Huang Shaoxiong Remains in Shanghai for Medical Treatment; Chen Gongbo Visited and Had a Long Talk Yesterday</h3>

According to his family, Mr. Huang has a cold and fever and needs to stay in Shanghai for medical treatment. He will not be able to return to Hangzhou for another day or two. At around 10:00 AM yesterday, Minister of Industry Chen Gongbo visited Mr. Huang at his residence and had a lengthy discussion.</p>
<p>Li Zhixiang</p>
<p>29 years old, local, imprisoned on August 15th for theft. [The officer] asked Zhao if [Li] was the inmate number 268. Zhao (replied) did not recognize the person. The officer also questioned the plaintiff Guo Tang Youmei, who still testified as before, seeking redress for her elder brother. (Asked) Are you requesting that the defendant be punished? (Answered) I am seeking redress; please let the honorable official handle it according to law. (Asked) Besides seeking punishment for the defendant, is there any other intention? (Answered) No. The officer then told the private prosecution lawyer that he had clearly questioned the parties involved and they had no other intentions. The lawyer said that because the court had held several hearings to investigate evidence, the plaintiff had not yet submitted the exact amount of the private prosecution. Now, she requests in court that the court postpone the hearing to allow her to review the file in detail before submitting the private prosecution complaint. The officer then asked the defendant's lawyer if there was any rebuttal evidence to present. Lawyer Xue Dubi requested that another staff member from the Asia Hotel, who directly manages the rooms and is not a tea boy, be summoned for questioning. The officer decided to summon the staff member. At this point, the court considered the evidence investigation complete and the case clear, and ordered</p>
<p>Beginning of the Debate</p>
<p>First, the police department lawyer presented his argument, followed by the defendant's lawyers, Lin Wu and Xue, who presented their defenses one after another. Finally, Prosecutor Wang Ren presented his prosecutorial opinion. The court then announced the end of the debate and scheduled sentencing for 2:00 PM on the afternoon of the 18th. The defendant's lawyer requested that the defendant be allowed bail because he was ill and had been detained for many days. The court said it would decide after sentencing. The defendant was temporarily remanded into custody. The court adjourned at 7:10 PM, after being in session for around five hours. All officials were hungry.</p>

<h3>Engagement Dispute of Female Film Actor: Chen Jiazhen Sues Diao Banhua for Insult; Both Sides Looked at Each Other and Smiled from Time to Time During Testimony; As a Result, Diao Was Sentenced to a Fine of Fifty Yuan with a Two-Year Suspended Sentence</h3>
<p>Chen Jiazhen, a 23-year-old employee of the Sihai Insurance Company from Shaoxing, residing at No. 4 Willow Village, Chieh Dah Road, as he was a photographer for various magazines, he knew many movie stars. Diao Banhua (original name Wu Mingxiang, 19 years old, from Hebei Province, residing at No. 7, Latoufang, La Xia Road) of the Lianhua Film Company, also met Chen. After about a week, because Diao often had boring social engagements, the two discussed getting engaged to resist it. On August 7th of this year, when Diao returned home from a social engagement, she wrote an engagement contract on a piece of scrap paper, and Chen immediately planned to publish a statement in the newspaper based on this. Unexpectedly, Diao suddenly changed her mind the next day and forced Chen to withdraw the advertisement he had sent to various newspapers. Since then, the two have been attacking each other in the newspapers. Now, Chen, based on the denial of engagement published by Diao in the Shen Bao on August 13th, the Chen Bao on the 24th, the article "Sweeping Away" written by Diao in the Social Daily on September 10th and 11th, an article written by Diao in the Da Wan Bao on September 10th, and Diao's remarks published in the Xiao Chen Bao on September 16th, etc., claims that the words in them, such as referring to Chen as a parasite in the electric [cinema] world, shameless, a cowardly turtle, etc., were all insults to him. Therefore, he hired a lawyer to sue Diao for defamation in the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the third criminal court for questioning, and the audience was full. Diao also arrived in court on time with her lawyer. First, Chen Jiazhen testified that the words he wrote in various newspapers, referring to the engagement, was me spreading rumors, the engagement was fake, and saying I was a parasite, a cowardly turtle, etc., all constitute insults, so I filed a complaint. But I recognize that the engagement was not a joke, it was a real thing. At that time, the initiation of this matter was requested by the defendant herself, the time was 10:00 AM on August 8th at my house, and she left after about an hour. He then presented several papers, including the engagement contract written by Diao herself, as proof. Questioned about it, Diao Banhua testified that on the evening of August 7th, the plaintiff happened to be at my house, and at this time someone invited me out, and I did not return until late at night. The plaintiff was still there and said to me, "I heard that many people outside are plotting against you. If you want to avoid it, you can only get engaged to someone," and said that I can sacrifice myself for you, pretend to be engaged. At that time, we took paper and scribbled randomly, and what the plaintiff presented to the court is one of them. The next day, I asked my parents, who said that engagement is a big deal and cannot be faked. I immediately found the plaintiff and told him that I had sent the engagement announcement to various newspapers and immediately firmly ordered him to withdraw it. However, afterwards, he still spread rumors outside that he was engaged to me, so I published an announcement denying that I was engaged to or living with anyone. As for the words I wrote in various newspapers, they were completely for self-defense and not meant to be insulting. As for the draft of the engagement announcement, it was written by the plaintiff and stamped with my seal. It was not from me. I don't know how the plaintiff got it, because my seal is useless and I put it anywhere. The time of writing the engagement paper was around 4:00 AM on the 7th, not at the plaintiff's house on the 8th. I did not go to the plaintiff's house on the 8th. This matter was fake and not a real engagement with the plaintiff. However, during the testimony of both parties, they looked at each other and smiled from time to time, as if they were not in court. At this point, the court deemed the facts clear and ordered the start of the debate. When it was the defendant's lawyer's turn to defend, the lawyer first explained the facts, and then said that the plaintiff used this opportunity to make his publications and photos popular. The court then announced the end of the debate and immediately announced the verdict. The main text was that Wu Mingxiang publicly insulted a person and was fined fifty yuan. If she was to be sentenced to labor service, it would be calculated at one yuan per day, with a two-year suspended sentence. After the verdict, the court adjourned.</p>

<h3>YMCA Welcomes Ms. Ding Shujing</h3>
<p>Ms. Ding Shujing, the General Secretary of the National Association of the Chinese Christian Women's Young Men's Christian Association (YWCA), formerly the Vice President of the World Association, attended the expanded meeting of the Executive Committee of the World Association held in Geneva this summer. She was warmly welcomed. After the meeting, she detoured through the Americas and returned to China via Japan, arriving in Shanghai last week. Members of the National Association and Chinese and foreign dignitaries, recognizing Ms. Ding as a Chinese woman who has promoted general education and earned international recognition, and acknowledging her hard work, held a meeting on the 11th at the Association Hall, No. 233 Yuamingyuan Road, to welcome her and express their admiration. Attendees included the association's president, Madam Huang Xiufeng, vice president Ms. Sun Wang Guoxiu, and other committee members such as Madam Mei Huaquan, Madam Zheng Zhangcheng, Madam Guo Keti, Madam Zhu Youyu, and other Chinese and foreign guests such as Legislator Luo Yunyan and his wife, Madam Li Tingan, Madam Niu Huisheng, Mr. Yang Xizhen, and representatives from the Youth Association, the YWCA, the National Christian Council, the Ciyou (Orphanage) Association, and the Shanghai YWCA, totaling over a hundred people. They were all splendidly dressed and gathered together. First, Chairman Madam Huang Xiufeng delivered a welcome speech, and read welcome telegrams from YWCAs in various locations, including Taiyuan, Beiping, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Jinan, Yantai, Tianjin, Xiamen, Taishan, Wuchang, Hankou, Changsha, Nanjing, and over ten other places. Subsequently, Ms. Ding gave a speech on her experiences abroad, stating that the purpose of her trip was to attend the expanded meeting of the World Association Executive Committee and to represent the Chinese Ciyou (Orphanage) Association at the 5th International Congress of Family Education held in Belgium. The YWCA movement worldwide has been developing rapidly in recent years, with over one million members representing over forty countries. The Executive Committee is composed of representatives from seventeen countries. The expanded meeting of the Executive Committee was held in Geneva on June 10th. In addition to China, representatives from countries such as England, the United States, France, Italy, Switzerland, Austria, and New Zealand attended. The meeting lasted seven days, discussing many matters, such as re-evaluating the social status and contributions of modern women, strengthening the solidarity of women, preparing to train a large number of talented individuals, and paying close attention to social issues such as labor welfare facilities, the advancement of women's careers, and the improvement of film entertainment. The association also recognized that the YWCA movement has always focused on Europe and the United States, and there is still much ignorance about affairs in the Far East. Therefore, the next expanded meeting is scheduled to be held in India in October of next year, and the World Congress will be held in China in 1938, so that European and American women can visit the East for on-the-spot inspections and gain more understanding. Ms. Ding also reported that Ms. Nie Wen'en, the General Secretary of the World Association, has retired due to old age and is now succeeded by Ms. Woods. Ms. Woods was originally an officer of the American YWCA and has rich experience. Her assumption of office will surely promote the development of the association's affairs. After the speech, she talked with the guests and members about her feelings about traveling in Europe, tirelessly and with great pleasure. At six o'clock, a tea party was held, and everyone dispersed with great enjoyment.</p>

We hope that all rickshaw owners will be notified that if there are such rickshaw pullers, they must quickly take photos and exchange their certificates, otherwise they will not be allowed to pull rickshaws even if they have cards. (2) The rickshaw owners who have introduced and registered rickshaw pullers, except for those who have gone missing, must provide the current armband numbers of their rickshaw pullers one by one, and the guild will affix them to the forms separately and forward them for statistics. The actual situation will then be registered after a review.</p>

<h3>Wusong Barber Strike Comes to an End</h3>
<p>The incident that occurred in the Taixing Road area of Wusong on the day before yesterday (National Day), when members of the Bao Shu Tuan (Protection and Self-Defense Corps) clashed with barbers from Yangzhou, resulting in the head injury of Yang Zixiang, a member of the Bao Wei Tuan, was followed by the Wusong Police Station's arrest of Yang Zixiang of the Bao Wei Tuan, barber Wang Chenwen, villager Yang A'san, etc., who were sent to the Shanghai General Public Security Bureau. On the evening before last (the 11th), the Bao Wei Tuan again arrested seven or eight barbers, which led to a strike by all the barbershops in Wusong yesterday. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The Cause of the Conflict According to this incident, Wang from Yangzhou, who lives on Taixing Road and makes a living by farming, had a son named Wang Chenwen who was a barber in the Meimei Barber Shop. On the afternoon of the previous day, Wang Kangqu saw a cow eating his flower and bean plants in his field, so he dragged the cow to a nearby earthen grave. Later, Yang A'san, the owner of the cow, came to the field and, not seeing the cow, accused Wang Kangqu of stealing it. Wang then demanded compensation for the flower and bean plants that had been eaten, and a conflict ensued, eventually leading to a brawl. At that time, Wang Kangwei's daughter-in-law ran to the Meimei Barber Shop and called out to her husband, Wang Chenwen, to rush over, and they fought each other. At that time, the head of Yang Zixiang, a member of the Bao Wei Tuan, was injured. The police officer on duty at Taixing Road, who was dispatched by the Wusong Police Station, heard the noise and rushed to the scene, and arrested Yang A'san, the owner of the cow, Yang Zixiang, a member of the Tuan, and six barbers including Wang Kangwei and Wang Chenwen, and sent them to the station. The next afternoon, Director Deng Zhiyi prepared a document and sent police officers to send all the witnesses in the case to the Third Section of the Public Security Bureau for interrogation.</p>
<p>The Strike Subsides After this case was sent to Shanghai, before the Public Security Bureau had made a judgment, the Bao Wei Tuan suddenly arrested seven or eight people, including Li Tongchun, the owner of the Longfeng Barber Shop, at six or seven o'clock the evening before last, and sent them to the Bao Wei Tuan headquarters. Then, at midnight, they transferred the barbers to the Wusong Police Station, which led to yesterday's strike. Yesterday afternoon, Inspector Liu Guoshu was specially dispatched by the Public Security Bureau to Wusong to investigate the truth of the incident. The barbers one by one stated that the Bao Wei Tuan had illegally arrested them, and they were all unwilling to return to their shops. Director Deng and Inspector Liu repeatedly persuaded them, and Director Deng and Inspector Liu personally accompanied the barber representatives to the barbershops to persuade them to resume business first and wait for a legal solution. Therefore, the strike has now come to an end.</p>

<h3>"Miscellaneous Records of Xiqing" Published as the Fifth Volume of "Rare Books of Chinese Literature Series"</h3>
<p>"Miscellaneous Records of Xiqing" in four volumes, the fifth volume of the "Rare Books of Chinese Literature Series" published by the Shanghai Magazine Company, was published today. The book was written by Shi Wugang of Jintan. Shi was a famous scholar during the Qianlong and Jiaqing periods, who was indifferent to fame and fortune. After becoming a Jinshi (successful candidate in the imperial examinations), he was appointed as a professor in Huai'an for five years, but he resigned and did not serve as an official. As a recluse, he traveled between Huai'an and Yangzhou. "Miscellaneous Records of Xiqing" in four volumes was written during that time. Eccentric scholars, lonely guests, female fairies, Buddhist monks, gatherings and separations of friends, all that can be passed on in words and deeds are included, whether it is heaven or earth. The poems and lyrics recorded are mostly sad and beautiful, especially the records of Shuangqing, which are deeply moving and make the reader shed tears of sympathy. In his later years, he personally revised and deleted the original text by two-fifths. The current circulation is the revised version. The series will seek the first edition without missing any parts and will be proofread and postscripted by Mr. Zhang Jinglu. The retail price is only thirty cents, and the special edition is forty cents. In addition, Shi's sequel, "Huayang Miscellaneous Manuscripts," will also be included in the first volume of the series. The first edition of the rare book has collections by A Ying and Zhou Shoujuan, and has been submitted to the Shanghai Magazine Company for typesetting. It will be published next month. Thus, Shi's works can be said to be complete. The subscription for the series will close at the end of this month. Pay 17 yuan for the popular edition or 24 yuan for the special edition in one lump sum, or pay 6 yuan first and then 3 yuan each for four months to receive the books.</p>

<p>City Sounds</p>
<p>Yuebin Restaurant Practices New Life Since Yuebin Restaurant, a Beijing cuisine restaurant on Sanma Road and Daxin Street, implemented the new life, it has been striving to lower the prices of various dishes, and the quality of the temporary materials and the deliciousness of the dishes are superior to its peers. Recently, guests have been patronizing, and the seats are full. Those who arrive later often have no seats. The half-sold vegetables are most praised by customers. The alternative charge of half of the green fee is to taste the different flavors of the provinces, which is a precedent for vegetable dishes. As for the attentive service and hospitality, it is even more so.</p>
<p>Joint City Market Price Gifts The China Book Industry Joint Market in the city center on Sima Road has been jointly organized by major bookstores across the country. There are no less than 10,000 kinds of books and magazines in the market. In addition to the classification, customers are free to view them. Therefore, since the start of trading, the business has been growing. It is heard that today is the official opening day of the market. The selling prices of all books have been specially reduced. All circles are welcome to go and visit. In addition, practical gifts will be given to customers as a souvenir. The editor states that according to Mr. Zhou Qixin of Xianda Silk Shop, he stated that the news (Xianda Silk Shop owner Zhou Qixin accused of issuing bad checks) published on the 14th edition of the Shen Bao on the 9th of this month is completely inconsistent with the facts. Mao Pengnian of Renji Silk Shop is a shareholder and salesman. In another case, he himself has admitted that the check was borrowed from me by Mao Pengnian on behalf of Renji Silk Shop. There is no reason for owing money at all. I have already filed a civil suit in another case to confirm that the check is invalid. Now Renji Silk Shop is using the name of Ni Lanping to falsely accuse me of issuing bad checks in the Criminal Court in an attempt to obtain illegal benefits. I have also appointed a lawyer to appear in court to deal with it. However, right and wrong should be subject to the court's judgment. However, the report disclosed inaccuracies concerning reputation, and I specially entrusted your lawyer to send a letter on behalf of me, please correct it to avoid misrepresentation, etc. Based on this, a joint letter is sent, hoping that you will check and grant a correction, hereby addressing the editor-in-chief of Shen Bao, lawyer Chen Maoxuan, October 11th.</p>
<p>Dear Editor, I am writing to you regarding the news about our orchestra's concert published in your newspaper on October 9th, in which there are some inconsistencies with the facts. Our orchestra's 10th anniversary was celebrated with a public performance organized by friends from all walks of life in Shanghai, with the support of President Sun and Mr. Wu Jingxiong, etc. There was no special appointment by President Sun to 　 our orchestra to perform. Furthermore, after Mr. Bai was invited to be an honorary secretary, although he was busy planning, there was no "pointing" or "　 Chang" in the rehearsal. Please publish this letter in your newspaper to clarify the facts. With best wishes, Teng Baiye, October 11th.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Sixth National Games, Day 3: Three New Records Set in Men's and Women's Athletics; Records Broken in Women's Discus, Long Jump, and Men's 800 Meters; Ball Games Gradually Intensifying, Interest Increasing Daily</h3>
<p>The National Games, yesterday was the third day. The weather was still good, but the audience decreased significantly. Men's and women's athletics again set three new national records yesterday, for Shanghai's Chen Rongtang in the women's discus throw, Qian Hangsu in the women's hurdles semi-final, and Jia Lianren in the men's 800 meters final. In the 800 meters final, the top three all broke the national record, which was particularly commendable and added much luster to yesterday's event. In terms of the medal standings for men's and women's athletics, Shanghai still holds the lead, and the championship is no longer a question. The situation in men's tennis games is gradually becoming tense, and interest seems to be focused on this event. Today's highlight is the singles match between Xu Chengji and Xu Weipei.</p>
<h3>Heroes Gather for 800 Meters: Jia Lianren Sets New National Record; Time of 2 Minutes 3 Seconds and 1 Tenth of a Second, Top Three All Set New Records; Li Shiming Second, Dong Shuzhao Third, Fierce Competition</h3>
<p>The "Gathering of Heroes" in the 800-meter race gave the audience great excitement and created a glorious memory for the Games. Shanghai's Jia Lianren had long cherished great ambitions and indeed displayed his talents, setting a new national record of 2 minutes 3 seconds and 1 tenth of a second with light steps. The highly anticipated Li Shiming and Dong Shuzhao finished second and third, respectively, but their times, the former at 2 minutes 4 seconds and the latter at 2 minutes 4 seconds and 1 tenth of a second, were also new national records. This race was held yesterday after the women's 100-meter preliminary round. When the starting gun sounded, they were unwilling to fall behind each other, like running a 200-meter race, striving forward with all their might. At that time, Li Shiming was in the lead, and the surrounding applause was thunderous because everyone expected Li to win the championship. Tens of thousands of heads moved, shouting cheers in unison. At that time, champion Jia Lianren was in third place, and Dong Shuzhao closely followed Li Shiming, unwilling to give up an inch. When running to the 400-meter mark, Jia Lianren gradually advanced to second place, only about four meters away from Li. Until the final turn, Jia made a sudden sprint with all his strength, and Dong Shuzhao also accelerated to chase. At this moment, the atmosphere of the entire field was heated and tense. Li had already fallen back to third place, and Jia Lianren stood out in front, only ten meters or so from the finish line. Li mustered his strength and chased desperately, securing second place by a hair's breadth. Jia reached the finish line in 2 minutes 3 seconds and 1 tenth of a second, with Dong only one step behind. The top three all set new records. The results are listed on the left:</p>
<p>(1) Jia Lianren (Shanghai)...2 minutes 3 seconds and 1 tenth of a second (4) Qiu Zhongcheng (Shanghai)</p>
<p>(2) Li Shiming (Liaoning)...2 minutes 4 seconds (5) Li Yanxiang (Jiangsu)</p>
<p>(3) Dong Shuzhao...(Shanghai) 2 minutes 4 seconds and 1 tenth of a second (6) Wu Bingsheng (Hebei)</p>
<h3>Men's Long Jump Final: Ye Suian Wins Championship; Zhang Jiakui Falls to Third, Wang Jihuai Second; Score of 7 Meters 76 Falls Short of Potential Peak</h3>
<p>In the men's long jump final, Zhang Jiakui originally had a score of 7 meters 09, and Ye Suian's score in the Malayan pre-selection was 7 meters even, so the two were the most popular before the competition. More than fifty people participated in the final. In the first round of jumps, Shanghai's Wang Jihuai led with 6 meters 605. None of the others exceeded 6 meters 50. In the second jump, Ye Suian got 6 meters 761. At this time, Zhang Jiakui was still unable to recover. After three jumps, those who obtained the right to the final were Ye Suian, Wang Jihuai, Wang He, Zhang Jiakui, Yu Qingrong, Wang Hongjin, and other six people. Wang He got 6 meters 519 on the fourth jump. Zhang Jiakui only got 6 meters 54 on the fifth jump. None of the six people participating in the final achieved any special results, which was very disappointing. The softness of the runway had an impact, and the postures of the athletes were not up to standard. Zhang Jiakui's stiff running and Wang Jihuai's jumping height were far inferior to previous years. Ye Suian's running speed was also slightly lacking. Wang He still needs to exert more force in his aerial movements. There is definitely potential for excellent results to appear. The scores of the top six are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Ye Suian (Malaya) 6 meters 76</p>
<p>(2) Wang Jihuai (Shanghai) 6 meters 605</p>
<p>(3) Zhang Jiakui (Shanghai) 6 meters 54</p>
<p>(4) Wang He (Shanghai) 6 meters 519</p>
<p>(5) Yu Qingrong (Liaoning) 6 meters 38</p>
<p>(6) Wang Hongjin (Jiangsu) 6 meters 368</p>

<h3>Liu Changchun Forfeits 200 Meters; Will Focus on Two Relay Races; Liaoning's All-Around Hopes Are High</h3>
<p>The reporter met with Mr. Changchun yesterday and inquired about the reason for his withdrawal from the 200 meters. According to Mr. Liu, in the 100-meter final the day before, due to excessive exertion, he had not recovered from fatigue. Therefore, he decided to give up yesterday's 200-meter final. Mr. Liu also said that Liaoning has high hopes for the all-around championship this time. Guo Jie's pentathlon is quite promising, but he is afraid of being no match for Hao Wang, and Zhou Changxing's decathlon is also a strong opponent for Zhang Lingjia, or may have a chance to beat Zhang. If they can get second place in the 400-meter relay and the 1600-meter relay, they can win the all-around championship. Therefore, Mr. Liu will show his skills again in the two relay races. Finally, according to Mr. Liu, it is a pity that Tan Fuzhen was unable to participate in the hurdles competition due to illness.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Women's Athletics: Two More National Records Set; Chen Rongtang Throws Discus 30 Meters 055; Qian Hangsu Takes 14.3 Seconds in Hurdles Semi-Final</h3>
<p>Yesterday's women's discus final was quite a highlight of the Games. Chen Rongtang's victory was predicted by this newspaper. Ms. Chen had won the shot put championship the day before, and regretted not breaking the national record. She had already resolved to break the national record in yesterday's discus final. After the competition started, Chen took the lead, throwing over 27 meters with one hand. In the first throw, she achieved a score of 30 meters 055, breaking the national record of 28 meters 66 held by Ma Ji. The second place was Shanghai's Chen Shufang, who also reached 28 meters 10, also close to the national record. The third was Shanghai's Ding Guimei, the fourth was Fujian's Xu Meiying, the fifth was Hebei's Hu Wenlan, and the sixth was Malaya's Chen Jinxiang. The scores were far from the first place. The full scores are recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Chen Rongtang (Shanghai) 30 meters 055 (New)</p>
<p>(2) Chen Shufang (Shanghai) 28 meters 10</p>
<p>(3) Ding Guimei (Shanghai) 24 meters 89</p>
<p>(4) Xu Meiying (Fujian) 24 meters 615</p>
<p>(5) Hu Wenlan (Hebei) 23 meters 895</p>
<p>(6) Chen Jinxiang (Malaya) 23 meters 73</p>
<p>In yesterday's preliminary and semi-final races, interest was slightly reduced due to Liu Changchun's withdrawal from the 200 meters. Although Tao Yingjie and Lin Shaozhou achieved scores of 16.4 seconds in the high hurdles, it was not exciting. Only the women's 80-meter hurdles semi-final yielded a new harvest. Qian Hangsu created a new national record with 14.3 seconds, which can be said to be a highlight. Qian was already noticed by the audience when she appeared. Her starts and hurdles were skilled and profound. She took three steps between hurdles, with no unevenness. Ms. Xu Fengying of Malaya was also a strong competitor and competed fiercely with Qian, but she was ultimately no match.</p>

<h3>Today's Final Predictions: Fierce Competition in Women's Track Events</h3>
<p>Men's Javelin</p>
<p>The men's javelin final is bound to be spectacular and is one of today's highlights. Beiping has the general Peng Shuixin, while Shanghai has Hao Chunde, Tang Zhifen, and Wang Xuewu. Liaoning has Zhou Changxing and Guo Jie. The championship will belong to the veteran Peng Yongxin. Peng is the maintainer of the javelin record. In addition to the above-mentioned strong athletes, Zhang Lingjia, Li Shiming, Zhao Qiming, etc. are also not weak.</p>
<p>Women's High Jump</p>
<p>The women's high jump championship will belong to Fujian's Chen Cuifang or Beiping's Li Xianying, because the past scores of the two have been equal to the national record. However, the scores of the women's high jump are all similar, and there may be an upset at that time. Others with hope of being selected include Shanghai's Rong Shuzhen, Malaya's Ge Yulian, Beiping's Fang Yun, Shanghai's Zhu Tianzhen, and Hebei's Wang Shuzhen.</p>
<p>Men's High Hurdles</p>
<p>The championship will belong to Lin Shaozhou, but his strong opponents are Liu Yingjun and Huang Yingjun. However, there are always unexpected events in high hurdles competitions, and one accident can easily lead to failure, as exemplified by Chen Jiayou's fall and elimination yesterday. Others such as Li Houda, Yang Muhe, Li Jinquan, and Zhu Wenji all have hopes of being selected, with scores expected to be between 16.1 seconds and 16.34 seconds.</p>
<p>Men's 200 Meters</p>
<p>Since Liu Changchun will not participate in the men's 200-meter final, the championship will undoubtedly belong to Chuan Jincheng. However, it is feared that there will be nothing special in terms of scores. The other rankings are still difficult to predict.</p>
<p>Women's Hurdles</p>
<p>The women's hurdles are Qian Hangsu's for the taking, and victory is extremely easy. Yesterday, Qian broke the national record with 14.3 seconds, but it is still not as good as the 13.3 seconds she created in summer camp. It is unknown whether she can break the 14-second mark in today's final. The other rankings will be clear after the competition.</p>
<p>Women's 100 Meters</p>
<p>The women's 100-meter final will be a battle for supremacy between Jiao Yulian, Deng Yinjiao, Li Sen, Qian Hangsu, and Chen Keng. In terms of strength, Li Sen is quite promising, but based on Deng Yinjiao's past scores, she seems likely to win. Jiao Yulian is the holder of the national record and is also a top competitor.</p>
<h3>Today's Final Rosters</h3>

<h3>The Competition Committee Again Yesterday Cancelled E Province Athlete Mei You's Qualification, Confirmed by Wu Bixian's Remarks, Stating Fair Disposal and Automatic Cancellation of Hao Chunde's Qualification; Beijing Has Already Sent a Reply Telegram</h3>
<p>Due to the cancellation of Hubei Province high jump athlete Wu Bixian's qualification by the Competition Committee for participating in pre-selections for two units, this newspaper's reporter visited Mr. Wu afterward. Mr. Wu's opinion was that while he simultaneously participated in the Hebei Province selection, Mei You still represented Hubei Province. He believed it was unfair that Hebei Province only protested against Wu and not Mei. After seeing this conversation, the Competition Committee conducted an investigation. To ensure fair handling, it automatically cancelled Mei You's qualification yesterday afternoon.</p>
<p>Hubei Team Leader Telegraphed Zhang Qun to Report</p>
<p>Regarding the cancellation of Hubei Province athlete Wu Bixian's qualification by the General Assembly Competition Committee, the Hubei Province General Team Leader lodged a protest with the Judging Committee the day before. That committee immediately convened a joint meeting of the Competition Committee members that evening to discuss the case. A unanimous decision was reached on the spot that Wu Bixian had violated the Assembly's resolution procedures, and his qualification was cancelled without any doubt or discussion. What needed to be discussed was the issue of the qualifications of the three Shanghai athletes, Wang Jihuai, Hao Chunde, and Xu Ting, raised by Hubei Province. Wang Jihuai neither participated in the Beijing pre-selection nor was selected to represent Nanjing, and he did not even agree to it himself, so there was no need for discussion. Only Hao Chunde and Xu Heng still had problems that needed to be investigated. It was resolved that the Competition Committee would telegraph Beijing and Hangzhou to inquire in detail. If they had similar situations as Wu Bixian, their qualifications to participate in this year's games would naturally be revoked. A decision will be made once the investigation is clear. As for the Hubei Province protest, a reply would be given after Hao Chunde's qualifications were clarified. It was also heard that the Assembly Judging Committee would convene another meeting to resolve this case once it received the telegrams from Beijing and Hangzhou regarding the proof of Hao Chunde's representative qualification within the next few days. Furthermore, Hubei Province General Team Leader Liu Changhe, due to the Assembly's cancellation of Hubei Province representative Wu Bixian's qualification, in addition to lodging a protest the day before, reported the details of the handling of this matter and requested instructions from Hubei Province Government Chairman Zhang Qun and Education Department Director Cheng Qibao. At 10 a.m. yesterday, Mr. Liu also visited the Assembly Chairman, Shi Shijie, to personally explain that the Competition Committee's handling of this matter seemed unfair. Chairman Wang expressed his determination to ask the Competition Committee and the Judging Committee to resolve it fairly. The text of the telegram from the Hubei Province General Team Leader to Chairman Zhang and Director Cheng is recorded below: "Zhang, Chairman of the Wuchang Provincial Government, and Cheng, Director of the Education Department, received your telegram on the eighth with thanks. It was forwarded to the athletes, and they all felt shocked. In the high jump final on the tenth, Hubei Province's Wu Bixian came in first, but the Assembly Competition Committee cancelled his qualification due to new techniques that conflicted with the Assembly's competition rules. It also favored athletes from Shanghai and Nanjing who had violated the rules, which was extremely unfair. A protest has been lodged with the Judging Committee, but no reply has been received yet. Public opinion is very sympathetic to our province. Please see the Shanghai and Wuhan newspapers. If the reply is still inappropriate, we plan to continue protesting and see it through to the end. Please telegraph instructions for us to follow. Respectfully, the Hubei Province Delegation to the Sixth National Games."</p>
<p>Beijing Social Bureau Telegraphed a Reply to the Assembly</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 10th) Track and field athlete Hao Chunde is participating in the National Games this time under both Beijing and Shanghai, causing a qualification issue. The Beijing representative team stated that Hao serves in the Beijing Training Corps but represents Shanghai in the competition, which violates the competition rules. The Beijing representative team formally sent a letter to the Assembly for review and correction. The Assembly Competition Committee sent a telegram to the Beijing Municipal Social Bureau, asking whether the athlete Hao Chunde had agreed when your city handled his participation in the Sixth National Games pre-selection. If there is evidence of his consent, it should be sent to the Assembly for verification. After receiving the telegram, the Social Bureau reported it to the Municipal Government and telegraphed a reply to the Assembly, stating that Social Bureau Director and General Team Leader Chen Jianru could answer in detail regarding Hao Chunde's qualification issue and should be contacted nearby. In addition, it mailed a photo taken of Hao Chunde at the banquet hosted by the five newspapers, including the Central Daily News, for the Beijing athletes, as well as news from the newspapers that day, for reference.</p>
<p>Xu Heng's Qualification Should Not Be a Problem</p>
<p>Regarding Xu Heng's qualification issue, the Assembly did not telegraph Hangzhou to inquire. Since Shanghai has already recruited Xu Heng, and Xu himself is unwilling to represent Zhejiang Province, the Zhejiang Provincial Government Education Department had already sent a public telegram to the Assembly, stating its relinquishment. Because Mr. Xu did not want to represent Zhejiang Province, and Zhejiang Province was willing to relinquish, Xu Heng's qualification was no longer a problem. Therefore, the Assembly did not telegraph Hangzhou yesterday to inquire.</p>
<p>Zhang and Chen Resigned from the Judging Committee Yesterday</p>
<p>Judging Committee members Zhang Zhongfan and Chen Kun resigned because they did not receive notification of the joint meeting the night before, which made them feel they had been sidelined. Zhang and Chen sent a letter to this newspaper as follows: "Dear Sir, at yesterday's joint meeting of the Competition Committee and the Judging Committee, Zhongfan and others, who hold the position of Judging Committee member, did not receive notification in advance, and no formal record was published after the meeting. All responsibilities are attributed to the meeting's passage. According to the charter of the organization, we feel that this is inappropriate. However, we cannot remain silent due to our responsibilities. We can only resign from the position of Judging Committee member immediately to make way for the capable. We have attached the original letter of resignation to the Assembly below. We respectfully request publication to clarify our responsibilities. Zhang Zhongfan and Chen Kun, together."</p>
<p>Zhang et al.'s Resignation Letter is as Follows: "Dear Assembly, today, upon reading the newspaper, we learned that the Assembly held a joint meeting of the Competition Committee and the Judging Committee last night. Zhongfan and others were previously appointed as Judging Committee members, but we did not receive any notification of last night's meeting. Moreover, the important matters decided upon have not been formally recorded and publicly announced. The information in the newspapers is largely incomplete, and all responsibilities are entrusted to the meeting's passage. Zhongfan and others feel deeply ashamed of being sidelined. We respectfully return our Judging Committee badges and request that you hire capable people separately. Respectfully, to the Organizing Committee of the Sixth National Games, Zhang Zhongfan and Chen Kun."</p>

<p>Men's Tennis</p>
<h3>Tennis Interest Grows Xu Brothers Show Their Skills Doubles Six to One and Seven to Five Win Over Hong Kong He Men's and Women's Singles, 16 Games in Total, Very Lively Yesterday</h3>
<p>In men's tennis, a total of eight singles matches and four doubles matches were played yesterday. All the famous players from various regions appeared, so the battles were very tense. The singles match between Lin Baohua of Shanghai and Luo Guanggui of Hubei, and the doubles match between the Xu Chengji and Chengwei brothers of Java against Xu Weipei and He Jialiu of Hong Kong, were even more exciting, attracting no fewer than a thousand spectators, and there was almost no room to stand. It was the first grand occasion of this year's Games. Whenever there was a wonderful performance, the applause was like thunder, echoing in the sky, with enthusiastic emotions and high spirits. When Java and Hong Kong played doubles, Mayor Wu also came to watch the match and nodded his head frequently when he saw wonderful moments, expressing his satisfaction. The results of each group are as follows:</p>
<h3>Eight Singles Matches, Sichuan, Beijing, Shanghai, and Guangdong Achieved Complete Victory, Competitive Interest Grows Stronger</h3>
<p>The singles matches of the four groups from Sichuan, Zhejiang, Beijing, and Fujian started at 9 a.m. Wang Xizheng's hitting technique was skilled, and his shots were sharp. His opponent, Dai Guang of Zhejiang, had mediocre skills and was far from his match. Wang showed mercy and did not use his full strength. Whenever he showed his skills, Dai could not resist and could only shake his head frequently and admit defeat. Qian Zhibin of Sichuan did not show progress. The difference between him and Guo Pengnian of Zhejiang was very slight. Guo used softness to overcome strength, but even though Qian used all his strength, it still had little effect. After a fierce battle of two sets, Qian finally won in a state of exhaustion. Ma Shaobo of Beijing and Bei Quanen of Fujian had equal strength and were difficult to distinguish. The competition was extremely fierce. After three sets, both were exhausted. The battle between Li Buzu of Beijing and Hong Yunhui of Fujian ended the earliest. Li's skills were acceptable, but Hong's skills were very rudimentary. The situation was very different, forming a one-sided situation.</p>
<p>Lin Junbao Hua Takes on a Small Task</p>
<p>At 1 p.m., there were also four singles matches. In the match between Lin Baohua of Shanghai and Luo Guanggui of Hubei, Lin took a bold approach in the first set and won four consecutive games. Luo tried his best to avoid being shut out. Lin added another game and won with a score of six to one. In the second game, Lin's sharpness was still strong. Relying on his sharp cross-court shots and clever cut shots, he won again with a score of six to three. Luo tried his best to resist and never gave up, displaying all his skills. He actually managed to regain some ground and win several games. Although he was defeated yesterday, he was still glorious in defeat.</p>
<p>Qiu Junfei Sea Shots Back and Forth</p>
<p>Qiu Feihai of Shanghai relied on his long baseline shots and easily defeated Wu Guolin of Hubei. Wu was a latecomer to the sport, so it was not easy for him to win a game in the two sets against Qiu. Li Jun of Guangdong is a veteran of tennis, with a sharp and urgent style. Mao Kanghou of Jiangxi was new to the game, so he was no match. In the two games, Mao did not win a single game. Xu Runpei of Guangdong is the younger brother of Xu Weipei of Hong Kong, and his family has a long tradition in the sport, so he is not the same as ordinary people. Li Yunyan of Jiangxi had very impressive skills. The competition in the first set was fierce, and Xu won with a score of seven to five. In the second set, Li took the initiative to retaliate, winning three consecutive games, with a great momentum to recover lost ground. Unfortunately, his stamina was insufficient, and Xu exposed his weaknesses and used a vocal attack to make Li run around, resulting in Li losing the first set again with a score of four to six. The results of each match are as follows:</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng (Sichuan) 6-2 Defeated Dai Guangjin (Zhejiang)</p>
<p>Wang Wenzheng (Sichuan) 6-1 Defeated Dai Guangjin (Zhejiang)</p>

<h3>Interest Concentrated on Doubles Xu Brothers Defeated Hong Kong's Xu and He Performance Was Wonderful and Breathtaking</h3>
<p>At 3 p.m., the doubles started. Originally, four groups were scheduled to be held simultaneously, but due to insufficient space, the most exciting match, the Java-Hong Kong battle, was delayed. Ma Hualin Wang Su Ruanguo Ying against Xiangjun Ling Zhiyang Li Shikang, the style of famous players is indeed extraordinary Xiangjun counterattack is incompetent, avoid a round, the two-disc results, Mahua won, very easy, The cooperation between Luo Laojian Xiao Chao in Beiping is pure and skilled, and the Qingdao Hou Zhichang Huang Shenxuan is just like that. After the battle, the Luo brothers won two games in a row, Ji Zheng Bogu Li Dinggu and Su Shi Jing Xu Cida, are evenly matched between Bo Zhong, the situation is bland, not worth mentioning, you come and go, like cowhide in general, the wonderful is rare, it takes a long time to fight three games to separate the victory, the most exciting program Java and Hong Kong battles, detailed below</p>

After the start of the game, the atmosphere was tense, and the enthusiasm of the audience was unprecedented. The sound of drums and exclamations was endless. When it came to the wonderful places, the expressions on everyone's faces, even if you asked a thousand painters, could not be fully described.

<h3>Overwhelming Victory over Qinghai Mahua Initially Shows Its Power Sichuan and Qingdao Promoted Simultaneously Mongolia and Jilin Eliminated Successively</h3>
<p>The men's basketball game yesterday was a fair game without any abandonment, which is an excellent phenomenon for the conference. In the first battle between the Sichuan and Mongolia teams, both teams' ball skills were not very good. The Sichuan team was more skilled and won the victory. In the game between Malaya and Qinghai, the strength of each other was very different. One move was able to determine the outcome, and the result was a 90-point victory. The game between Qingdao and Jilin was more exciting. Qingdao is a strong team in this competition, and it eliminated the Jilin team with 46-25. There are four games today. The game between Hubei and Anhui is at 9 a.m., the game between Shanghai and Jin is at 1 p.m., the game between Hebei and Zhejiang is at 1 p.m., and the game between Guangdong and Fujian is at 1 p.m. Hubei and Shanghai are the strongest teams, and Anhui and Jin are not their opponents. The strength of Hebei, Zhejiang, Guangdong, and Fujian is average, and there will be a fierce battle at that time.</p>
<h3>Sichuan Eliminates Mongolia — 57 to 33 —</h3>
<p>The Sichuan vs. Mongolia match was the opening basketball game yesterday. At 9:00 AM, referee Xu Rukang gave the signal, and the battle commenced. Both teams were of average skill, making the game unexciting. The Mongolian team, comprised of students from the Mongolian-Tibetan School of the Capital, played individualistically, dribbling the ball alone without passing. The Sichuan team, however, understood cooperation, giving them a slight advantage. The Mongolian team scored the first four points, but Sichuan quickly equalized and then led 10 to 6. From then on, Sichuan maintained the lead, winning the first half 26 to 1. In the second half, the Mongolian team briefly rallied, with forwards Rong and Niu scoring several consecutive baskets, narrowing the score. However, this was short-lived, as Wei Zhang Hua secretly attacked and repeatedly broke through the enemy's basket. The Mongolian team then collapsed, losing 57 to 33. The lineups were as follows:</p>

<p>Nalai Heavily Defeats Qinghai — 90 to 20 —</p>
<p>The Malaya vs. Qinghai match was similar to the Philippines vs. Hunan game the day before. The difference in strength was too great, making it uninteresting. The Qinghai team traveled from afar with the intention of observing and learning, not necessarily to win. Although they were completely defeated yesterday, their sportsmanship was excellent, with very few fouls, earning them the sympathy of most of the audience. When the team scored a point, they were met with enthusiastic applause, showing sympathy for the underdog. The Malay team's skills were above average. Forwards Song Shangxian and Lin Shuiying were accurate shooters and had good coordination. Defender Li Mu stood strong, preventing anyone from entering. Malaya won the first half 53 to 8. In the second half, Malaya used their reserves, and Qinghai still couldn't resist, ultimately losing 90 to 20.</p>

<p>Qingdao Defeats Jilin — 46 to 25 —</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, Qingdao vs. Jilin, with Huang Shaoliang as the referee and Wu Demao as the inspector. Qingdao is one of the strongest basketball teams in this tournament. It was expected that Jilin would lose. However, Qingdao's tactics were not as good as we had hoped. Kong Yu, one of the "Five Tigers" of the past, seemed to have declined. Star player Zhang Yucai was good at stealing and shooting but lacked cooperation. Jilin, an average team, fought unusually hard, not losing too many points. With their abilities, they were not to blame for the loss.</p>
<p>Jilin's Han [illegible] Fu scored the first basket. Qingdao's Yu Genjia evened the score. Kong Qingyi and Zhang Yucai then scored successively, taking the lead. Qingdao's Chen Fulin also repeatedly scored. Qingdao's three forwards showed off their skills, scoring many points with long and short shots. Qingdao led by a large margin of 25 to 12 in the first half. After the break, Jilin improved slightly. After Chen Chang scored several baskets, they collapsed again, ultimately losing 46 to 25.

<p>Women's Basketball</p>
<h3>Guangdong and Zhejiang Triumph, Qingdao and Shandong Succumb, Malaya and Shanghai to Have a Thrilling Battle Today</h3>
<p>Yesterday's opening women's basketball games had two matches. At 10:00 AM, Guangdong played Qingdao. The Guangdong team was extremely sharp and easily defeated Qingdao 44 to 25. The Zhejiang vs. Shandong game was held at 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Zhejiang relied on a final effort to eliminate Shandong. There will be two games today: Hubei vs. Hebei at 8:00 AM, and Shanghai vs. Malaya at 3:00 PM. The Shanghai vs. Malaya game is expected to be quite exciting, but it is feared that the Malayan women will ultimately be no match for the Shanghai team.</p>
<h3>Guangdong Triumphs, Qingdao Misses Fail, 44 to 25</h3>
<p>The opening women's basketball game between Guangdong and Qingdao followed the men's game between Mongolia and Sichuan. Many people came to watch, and the number of people in the gymnasium doubled, especially athletes from Guangdong and Shandong.</p>
<p>The skills of the daughters of the South have long been praised. Rong Xianhong and Rao Huifen, who attended the last National Games, are still brave as before. Adding the Shanghai players Liu Mali and Chen Ruiping makes them as powerful as a tiger with wings. The coordination between the forwards and guards is excellent, and the forwards are especially sharp. Ms. Rong is exceptionally agile and truly a formidable talent. The Qingdao team is also not bad, but unfortunately, they are outmatched by the Guangdong team, and they are somewhat restricted. Referee Shu Hong blew the silver whistle, and the atmosphere of the game changed from dull to exciting. The Qingdao defender committed a foul, and referee Shu enforced the rules strictly. Rong Xianhong [illegible] raised her pink arm and scored the first point. She then received a long pass from Chen Ruiping and scored another basket. Qingdao's Ji Zhongfeng did not want to be left behind and scored a basket in return. The scores increased evenly. Guangdong won the first quarter by a small margin. After that, the competition became very intense. Both sides guarded closely and repeatedly stopped the game to discuss tactics. At the end of the first half, Guangdong was only slightly ahead by 21 to 15. After a short break, the Guangdong team greatly boosted their morale. The players' spirits were lifted. Ms. Rong's free throws were accurate, and she scored many points. The Qingdao girls committed many fouls and were frightened. The momentum of the game then changed sharply. In the third quarter, Guangdong scored another eleven points. The Qingdao team saw that time was running out and aimed to recover lost ground, but the guards were weak and unable to support them, resulting in more losses than gains. The sound of the horn signaled the end of time, and the Guangdong team eliminated Qingdao.</p>

<h3>Zhejiang Wins, Shandong Girls Lose, 21 to 9</h3>
<p>Yesterday's final basketball match was between Zhejiang and Shandong women. It was held at 3:00 PM, with Jiang Lianggui as the referee. Both teams were of average skill. The southern girls were good at trickery, while the northern girls were not as good at adapting. In the first half, they were evenly matched. In the second half, the Zhejiang team changed its strategy, assigning one player to guard one player, focusing on one player to shoot. The hometown girls suffered greatly. After the [illegible] break, Zhejiang's Ms. Zhu scored the first basket. Shandong reciprocated, and neither side gave way. Both sides guarded closely, and there were very few shooting opportunities. Zhejiang scored eight points in the first half, and Shandong scored six points. After a moment of silence, the battle resumed. Shandong's Qin Zhe sang and played by herself, adding two points, then one free throw, surpassing the score. The West Lake ladies quickly called a timeout and held a six-person military meeting on the spot, whispering to each other, secretly plotting. As expected, Zhu Lansheng and Li Qing scored one after another. Ms. Zhou specialized in guarding the wind. The Shandong army became flustered and incurable. As a result, the Zhejiang army won the final victory 21 to 9.</p>

<h3>Yesterday's Football: Guangdong, Hubei, and Beijing Triumph, Guangdong-Shandong and Hubei-Jiangxi Were One-Sided, Beijing-Henan Game Was Highly Competitive</h3>
<p>Yesterday's second round of football matches consisted of three games. At 8:00 AM, Hubei played Jiangxi, with Hubei winning 13 to 0. At 10:00 AM, Guangdong continued to play Shandong, and the Shandong heroes were completely defeated 0 to 9. At 4:00 PM, Nanjing played Henan. The two teams were evenly matched. The first half ended with no score. In the second half, Nanjing successively conquered two cities in Henan, ending the game 2 to 0. The game situation is briefly described below:</p>
<h3>Hubei Completely Defeats Jiangxi, 13 to 0 with No Effort</h3>
<p>The Hubei team's forwards, such as Fu Zhibin and Deng Zhiyang, were brave and good at fighting. The inner defense line was also well-balanced and energetic. Looking back at the Jiangxi army, their formation was disorganized, and their defense was weak. After the initial contact, the outcome was immediately clear. The Hubei team's five forwards rotated around Jiangxi's territory, and the ball rarely went beyond the middle line. The Jiangxi army was in a difficult situation, charging left and right, but failing to break through the encirclement. The first half ended with Hubei winning 6 to 0.</p>
<p>In the second half, the situation remained the same. The Jiangxi team tried to rally but failed to achieve anything. The soldiers were frustrated and unwilling to fight. The Hubei army was like a knife through butter, attacking and capturing as if entering no man's land. As a result, they scored seven more goals, with a total score of 13 to 0. The formations of both sides are as follows:</p>
<p>Hubei Team</p>
<p>Kang Huian Shao Yougong Liu Junmin Huang Xiang [illegible] Zhu Yunlong Wu Yingling Hu Kean Deng Zhiyang Jiang Chao Fu Zhibin Huang Shijin</p>
<p>Jiangxi Team</p>
<p>Li Peng Xie [illegible] Geng (off) Li Jingcai (on) [illegible] Changfu Xu Shaojie Wang Shiduo Liu Chenghu Yang Xukui Zhao [illegible] Min Chen Zulin Yuan He Liu Jiafu</p>
<h3>Guangdong Overpowers Shandong, Shandong Heroes Helpless</h3>
<p>The Guangdong team is famous far and wide. Although the Shandong heroes are capable and experienced in combat, they immediately encountered a strong enemy, were careful, and resisted desperately. Although they were ultimately defeated 0 to 9, the disparity in strength was not their fault.</p>
<p>Headwork</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM, amidst the sound of silver [illegible], the battle began. The southern athletes flew into the Shandong formation. The five forwards used swift and magical [illegible] to directly attack the Shandong camp. Before three minutes had passed, Guangdong's right inner forward Tan Jiangbai received the ball and used his head to head the ball into the net. The Shandong goalkeeper thought a flying general had descended from the sky and was caught off guard. Amidst the cheers of the Guangdong cheerleaders, the record was set. The Shandong heroes were unwilling to be outdone and mobilized the entire line to attack. There were several very good shooting opportunities, but ultimately the Shandong players' feet were inaccurate, going out of bounds and over the net. Soon after, the Guangdong army took advantage of the situation to attack, successively scoring three goals. The first half ended with a score of 4 to 0. In this game, the Shandong army fought fiercely, and Guangdong felt the victory was difficult despite winning.</p>
<p>Complete Collapse</p>
<p>In the second half, the Guangdong army's attack became even more urgent. In addition, the Shandong goalkeeper was flustered and confused, making frequent mistakes and losing consecutive cities. The overall situation was gone. The entire army's formation was shaken, melting like ice. The Guangdong team obtained the ball as if taking things out of a bag, creating another 5 to 0 record, with a total score of 9 to 0. The Shandong army was defeated. The lineups of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Guangdong Team</p>

<p>Yesterday's Victory: Guangdong's Football Team</p>
<h3>Nanjing Barely Beats Henan, Battle for Half the Game Undecided, Nanjing Scored Two Clean Goals in the Second Half</h3>
<p>Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, the football match between Nanjing and Henan was a display [illegible] of evenly matched teams, with a brilliant performance. There were no records in the first half, and the game was undecided. In the second half, Nanjing's Wang Xuanquan bravely scored a goal. In the last ten minutes, the Henan army's defender committed a foul while saving the ball, and [illegible] Shan Lu Donghai kicked in a goal. The skills of the two teams were equally matched, and it was difficult to tell who was better. The Beijing team was slightly better due to luck.</p>
<p>Undecided</p>
<p>The referee blew the whistle, and the game began. The Beijing team's left [illegible] Yang [illegible] Wei crossed the ball, forcing a corner kick, but it was unsuccessful. After that, He Xuequan took a free kick, and then got two more corner kicks, but both failed. Instead, Henan's left winger Wu Shuyun attacked along the edge, but fortunately the Beijing goal was solid and ultimately safe. After a chaotic battle for [illegible] minutes, Lu Donghai shot from 30 yards away, but it was also unsuccessful. After a fifteen-minute battle, neither side was able to break the record. Near the end of the game, Lu Donghai shot twice, but were greeted by goalkeeper Zou Guoan, and the defense, still safe. As a result, the score was zero to zero, and the first half ended undecided.</p>
<p>Beijing Team Triumphs</p>
<p>After the start, the Beijing team's defense committed a foul, and the goal was in danger, but the Henan team's forwards feet were inaccurate and failed to achieve results. Five minutes later, the Beijing team was active again. After Lu Donghai shot the ball over the field, Zhang Hongzao made a middle pass, Zou Guoan abandoned the goal to grab the ball, it was too late, Wang Xuanquan rushed into the net with the ball, setting a record. After another battle, Zhang Hongping and Yang Renwei successively shot, but they were all too hasty and failed to build anything. Qiu Jixian started a border defense uprising, and just as the ball was about to enter the goal, [illegible] Zou Guoan saved it. As the Henan team's generals were about to run out of time, they launched a large-scale counterattack, but because their feet were not spiritual, they were unable to wash away the shame. Before long, Lu Donghai took advantage of the penalty kick [illegible] to send the ball into the net again, 2 to 0, the Nanjing team won. The formations of the two teams are as follows:</p>
<p>Nanjing Team</p>

<h3>Men's Volleyball Preliminary Round: Hong Kong Easily Defeats Henan, Three Straight Losses Show Disparity</h3>
<p>Yesterday's volleyball preliminary round was Hong Kong vs. Henan. Volleyball in Hong Kong is a specialty, easy and familiar. Henan, not having chewed [illegible], naturally paled in comparison. As a result, Hong Kong directly won the [illegible] second round in a skillful and domineering manner. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Hong Kong 21 to 4 21 to 10 21 to 13 Henan</p>
<p>First Game At 1:00 PM, the two teams, under the command of Tan Tianpei, entered the field and started the game. After the positions were determined, Henan [illegible] Chunzhi set the record, but a [illegible] head burst [illegible], after all, not working. Unable to withstand Hong Kong's anger, Li Wolin responded from front to back. Suddenly, [illegible] Da Hualian came on the stage and worked hard, dropping heavy [illegible]. The scorer was busy registering the account, a string of beads, creating a one-sided situation of [illegible] and 1 to 1. Hong Kong won 6 without martial arts, reluctantly conceding two points. The first half ended with 11 to 2 switching sides. After switching fields, it was still the same. Fortunately, Henan took the opportunity of Hong Kong's carelessness and won two penalty points. The game ended with Hong Kong winning 21 to 4.</p>
<p>Second Game In the second game, the Henan army slightly changed its lineup, hoping to make up for the [illegible] of the [illegible], and so on. Therefore, on the court for a moment, the spirit [illegible] was very impressive. However, the strength was too far apart after all. Although Captain Liu Yongxiang held on to his height and strength, how could he stop the door without [illegible] skills. The team was selected, and more dangerous balls were used. It was impossible to save, and everything was left to fate. Therefore, it was not enough to attack, and it was not enough to defend. It was high-handed and low-handed, watching the cession of land and cities. The victory in this game must still be Hong Kong. The score [illegible] was 21 to 10.</p>
<p>Third Game In the third game, the old drama was replayed, but Hong Kong was inevitably arrogant [illegible] of the enemy, so it became an equal situation of advance and retreat. After 4 to 4, Hong Kong began to show its anger, attacking with great force, the firepower was as dense as artillery shells. Henan only had to parry. Except for some suicides in Hong Kong, there were very few points scored in the first half. Although there was a comeback in the second half, the difference was too much. Still 13 to 21, the Hong Kong army killed the entire army. The formations are as follows</p>
<p>Hong Kong Formation Zhou Yongmei Zhong Huachao Fu Baining Li Zhenan Li Wolin Ma Dengtang Wu Zhuo [illegible] Xu Zijun He Bingji</p>
<p>Henan Formation Zhu Zhaojun Liu Yongxiang Cheng Qiwu Liu Yi Gao [illegible] He Liu He Xu Jizong Wang Pixian Wu Xingzhi</p>

<p>The girls in Beiping are as delicate as flowers, and their health is far better than that of the ladies in Nanjing. At the beginning of the game, the strength of both sides seemed to be flat. Huang Qiangying in the front row of Nanjing and Fang Ji in the middle row of Beiping were all-rounders in this game. Beiping scored slightly in the front ball, Nanjing returned the color, and the surgery was light and joyful. The audience of the four seats was mesmerized. After 12 to 5 in the first half and after changing sides, the northern rouge exhausted the identity of the daughter, and in the middle and rear [illegible] row, she saved the dangerous ball to the most. Shen Chongji's passing, Li Baoji's split-kill, and Yan Xiaofen's slam were all commendable. Nanjing relied on Huang Qiangying as a pillar, with one person as the gatekeeper. Without the courage of thousands of husbands, could he be able to hold this heavy responsibility? So a thousand miles down, the game ended with 21 to 12, and Beiping shone brightly.</p>
<p>Brave and Vigorous</p>
<p>In the second game, both sides added some reinforcements. Looking at the conflict again, in Beiping, those who watched the wall were supportive, so they were brave and vigorous, and went smoothly. Shen Chongji raised his arm and served, and he scored a goal. After another one, he hit three catties in a row, winning the applause of the audience. The situation was the highest record in the volleyball world. Nanjing made a panic, and more mistakes were made, and there were occasional gains, but only a small amount was gained, which was useless. The second game ended with Beiping winning 21 to 5, and the ladies in Nanjing were extremely frustrated.</p>
<p>The General Trend is Gone</p>
<p>The volleyball match is played with a five-game three-win elimination system, so the [illegible] three games must be contested by Nanjing. Fang Bei served first, but his arm strength was insufficient, and he went out twice, and his momentum was no longer there. The director quickly taught the coping strategy, and a glimmer of life appeared. However, compared with the progress of fifty steps and one hundred steps, there was still a difference of one [illegible], so the difference between the first half and 10 to 11 was only one point, but the second half was greatly different. Although Nanjing wanted to reverse the crisis, when it was [illegible] 14 to 14, Beiping scored four points in a row, so the general trend was gone. Nanjing only had to cultivate again and wait for the opportunity to take revenge. The score was 21 to 13, and Beiping won.</p>
<p>Talented</p>
<p>Looking at the skills of both sides, Beiping has a good average development. Yan Xiaofen's split kill is indeed a rare talent, and its high jump and low pressure make the opponent incurable. This gentleman has created a lot of points. Huang Qiangying in Nanjing also has considerable merits, but the middle line is too loose, and when the ball comes, she cannot calm down and deal with it. The whole army resists, so if the enemy uses a surprise attack, it will be impossible to save. In the future, in terms of training, it seems that considerable attention should be paid to it.</p>

<p>Mongolian Wrestling Performance Today</p>
<p>The eight Mongolian wrestling experts, one manager, one leader, and one translator invited by the National Games Martial Arts Organizing Committee arrived in Shanghai at 7:15 AM yesterday. Enhe Amur, the leader of the Mongolian athletes who arrived earlier, greeted them at the station and accompanied them to the De Lin Apartments on North Sichuan Road. Around 3 PM yesterday, led by Mr. En, they visited the National Games Martial Arts venue and took photos with Chief Referee Chu Minyi. It was agreed that they would perform at the venue this afternoon. Their names are translated as follows: Leader Idama, Instructor Uweixin, Translator Zha Jun, Wrestling Experts (1) Zengge, (2) Bao Lubatur, (3) Badama, (4) Sandong Zhamusu, (5) Uertu Xingsutu, (6) Youhe, (7) Luobusang Zhamusu, (8) Batur. The reporter had a brief conversation with the team's translator at the Martial Arts venue. (Asked) Where in Mongolia are they from? (Answered) Xilingol League, Inner Mongolia. (Asked) Have they all been to school? (Answered) Most Mongolians believe in Buddhism, especially Lamaism. There are probably a few who have studied Buddhist scriptures and can read. (Asked) What do they do for a living on weekdays? (Answered) Most of them lead nomadic lives. (Asked) Have they ever been to the South before? (Answered) No. (Asked) What are their impressions after coming to the South this time? (Answered) Very good. (Asked) What do they think of Shanghai after arriving? (Answered) Because it is their first time here, they find it very strange. (Asked) How many types of martial arts do they know? (Answered) They only know wrestling. (Asked) When did they leave? (Answered) They departed from Ujimqin Banner in Xilingol League on the 22nd of the lunar month (last month). They arrived in Bailingmiao on the 8th of this month, and arrived in Shanghai this morning (i.e., yesterday morning), and so on.</p>
<p>Referees Show Off Their Skills</p>
<p>Yesterday afternoon, the martial arts competition ended around 4 PM. Chief Referee Chu Minyi, to satisfy the audience's interest, raised his voice and called upon the referees to hold a temporary performance. All the referees and leaders of various units happily agreed and volunteered to demonstrate their skills amidst the cheers of the audience.</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>The names and boxing styles are recorded as follows: (1) First, Ms. Zhai Lianyuan, the timekeeper, performed One Road Chaquan, with nimble hands and fast steps, winning a lot of applause. She is a female martial arts instructor from Nanjing and is young and stylishly dressed. (2) Zhu Guozhen, the leader from Hunan, performed Xingyi. (3) He Shizhen, the leader of the Beiping Children's Team, performed the Eight Corner Sword. (4) Jin Yunting, a professor at Jiaotong University, performed Liu Liuhe. (5) Zhu Guozhen and Li Yuanzhi sparred, using Eight Extremes Boxing. (6) Tong Zhongyi's Plum Blossom Double Halberds. (7) Liu Baichuan's Swordsman Saber. (8) Hao Jinquanpei, the leader from Hebei, performed Tai Chi. (9) Liu Buxian, the leader from Hebei, demonstrated combat skills. (10) Ma Yueliang's Backhand Tailou. (11) Bin Laigeng's Taiyi Boxing. (12) Liao Shiqiu's Pihai Boxing. At this time, someone shouted, "Please Mr. Chu, the referee, perform!" Mr. Chu initially declined but, pressured by the enthusiastic applause of the audience, slowly entered the arena, took off his coat, picked up a saber, and performed a set of Tai Chi Saber. The applause from the entire audience was thunderous. Finally, Yang Jiaren, Tong Zhongyi, and Kou Yunxing demonstrated shooting arrows and drawing a hard bow, which was particularly valuable. First, Yang Jiaren used a three-force bow (i.e., thirty catties) to shoot arrows from a distance of forty-five steps, hitting one arrow out of three. Next, Tong Zhongyi performed (at the same distance). Mr. Tong calmly fired three arrows in a row, hitting the bullseye each time, demonstrating the ability to pierce the willow leaves from a hundred paces away. No wonder the entire audience cheered endlessly. After the archery, Yang and Tong, along with Guan Lianxing, successively drew the hard bow, drawing it equally with both hands, showing considerable skill. The performances ended at 5:10 PM.</p>

<h3>Shanghai Overwhelms Hunan: A Satisfying Victory with a Net Score of Thirty-Six Points; A Hard-Fought Nine Innings with Only Three Hits</h3>
<p>Yesterday's baseball championship featured the preliminary game (Group A) between Shanghai and Hunan. Before the game, they practiced against each other, and their movements foreshadowed the outcome, requiring no complex shifts in the battle. After nine innings, Shanghai achieved a satisfying victory, leading Hunan by a net score of thirty-six points. Hunan scored nothing, only managing three hits. The umpire was Hou Luoxun, the base umpire was Liu Dacheng, and the recorder was Li Baojun. Shanghai's pitcher was Gan Zhen (An Lesheng for the last five innings), and the catcher was He Xiancheng (He Qionghua for the last five innings). Hunan's pitcher was Huang Zhizhan, and the catcher was Liu Xuezhao. Tomorrow at 3 PM, Shanghai will face Hebei.</p>
<p>Showing Off Their Skills, Iron Cavalry Races Across the Field</p>
<p>Shanghai, selected for this tournament, harbors great ambition. As the competition begins, each player demonstrates courage and strives to be first. The pitcher's throws are curved and powerful, the catcher's reception is measured, the infield is hard to penetrate, and there's no room for maneuvering along the outfield. The defense is thorough, and the offense is also commendable. With each swing, the ball is hit more often than not and lands on the base, then with smart steals and hidden attacks, they get back to the home base. In the nine innings, with the exception of a sacrifice in the ninth, they came back empty-handed only in the fourth inning. In the other seven innings, they scored as high as seven or eight, and at least one to three points.</p>
<p>Fighting Hard Against Strong Opponents, Making an Effort to Achieve</p>
<p>Turning to Hunan, they fought hard against a strong opponent, never giving up. Though ultimately defeated, their spirit and effort were commendable. While their skills were inferior, they can be expected to improve in due time. In the nine innings, there were two double plays, the first in the second inning by the shortstop and second baseman, and the second in the fourth inning by the center fielder and second baseman. They also managed three hits, by center fielder Zheng Huiwu, left fielder Liu Bingyun, and second baseman Tian Kaiyuan.</p>
<p>A One-Sided Game from First to Ninth</p>
<p>From beginning to end, Shanghai completely dominated. Each time Hunan went up to bat, they struggled, occasionally occupying first or second base after a hit, but ultimately failing to reach home base, not for lack of trying, but due to a lack of strength. Shanghai scored seven points in the first inning, five in the second, eight in the third, zero in the fourth, four in the fifth, two in the sixth, four in the seventh, twelve in the eighth, and a sacrifice in the ninth. Even after switching the defense in the fifth inning, the situation barely improved. The scores above clearly demonstrate the one-sided nature of the nine innings.</p>

<h3>National Sports Society: Inaugural Meeting of Initiators</h3>
<p>The inaugural meeting of the initiators of the National Sports Society is scheduled for 5 PM on the 13th in the parlor of the De Lin Apartments to discuss the society's organizational rules and membership solicitation methods. All initiators have been notified to attend.</p>
<h3>Recommendations to the Organizing Committee of the Next National Games: Chen Kuisheng</h3>
<p>There are two goals in hosting a National Games: One is to improve the quality (focusing on creating new records), and the other is to promote popularity. Ideally, both should be emphasized equally, without bias. However, considering the current situation in our country, the quality does not seem to be very high. This can be proven by comparing our country's highest records with world records, which show a significant gap. The key to improving quality lies in promoting popularity, which has not yet reached an ideal state. Generally, to promote sports, we must first establish a foundation in elementary school physical education, and second, we must vigorously promote mass sports. These are tried and tested principles. If we rely on the popularity of elementary school physical education to improve records, this would be a long-term plan for a hundred years, with a distant source and a long flow, but it would be slow to produce quick results. If we rely on mass sports to improve records, we find that the general public currently has neither a foundation nor an interest in sports, so how can we expect any results? Among civil servants, only a tiny fraction, perhaps one in ten thousand, were college graduates who continue to practice diligently and advocate for sports. Therefore, to consider both quality and popularity, and to achieve both immediate results and establish a lasting foundation, the only solution is to modify the competition rules in the next National Games and add a men's secondary school group to provide assistance, while retaining the current system as the open group. The principle is to avoid increasing the time, effort, and expenses of the organizing committee and participating units, while ensuring that both the improvement of quality and the promotion of popularity are effectively achieved. Here are some simple measures for recommendation to the Organizing Committee of the next National Games, and to solicit responses and opinions from all units for open discussion:</p>
<p>(1) For the men's secondary school group, a weight limit should be set. Those who exceed the limit will be placed in the open group. The age and academic level should be roughly equivalent to an eighth-grade high school student (not necessarily limited to students; this is only to provide a standard for height and weight). When registering, each unit must provide the athlete's height and weight (using the traditional Chinese units of "shi chi" and "shi jin"). Upon arrival, the organizing committee will assign a specialist to verify or re-check. Based on past experience, the quality and quantity of women's sports are better in secondary schools than in universities, so there is no need to divide them into groups.</p>
<p>(2) In men's track and field events, each unit was originally allowed to register four athletes. Since we are now dividing them into open and secondary school groups, each unit should only be allowed to register one athlete per event in each group. The total number of athletes registered will not increase, but the division into groups will provide young athletes with the opportunity to compete and gain experience. In the past, although each unit registered four athletes for each event, only one or two performed well, while the others lagged far behind. If this method is adopted, athletes with slightly better records in the secondary school group will also have the opportunity to participate in the competition. The organizing committee will divide the competition into two groups, but because the number of athletes in the open group will be reduced, the competition time will not increase significantly, and there will be no additional increase in referees, labor, or expenses.</p>
<p>(3) It is more difficult to divide ball games into men's groups. If we divide all events into two groups, it will double the burden for the organizing committee and participating units, which is not feasible. If we do not divide them into groups, it will contradict the original purpose of the suggestion. It is difficult to find a perfect solution. However, upon investigation, some inland provinces have only one provincial university, and because of the lack of competition opportunities, their records are mediocre. Some provinces do not even have a provincial university, while secondary schools are generally more developed. Therefore, it can be inferred that each unit that considers its open group records to be inferior and its secondary school records to be better will only register for the secondary school group and not the open group. Considering the overall ball game records across the country, except for Nanjing, Beiping, Hebei (including Tianjin's strong presence), and Shanghai, the only special cases are Fujian, Macau, and Hong Kong in volleyball. Therefore, the number of teams in the open group will inevitably decrease, so that the organizing committee does not have to double efforts. Alternatively, the organizing committee can stipulate a limit, allowing each unit to join any group at will. It is expected that many inland provinces will want to join the secondary school group, while the Beijing-Tianjin-Shanghai areas will want to join the open group. The disadvantage of this system is that the secondary schools in the open group areas will not have the opportunity to participate in the National Games, which seems unfair. However, if the national supreme sports administrative authority can organize regional ball game competitions for the national secondary school groups within a reasonable timeframe, this can also be remedied. Furthermore, if our country's construction progresses rapidly, transportation is developed, and the supreme sports administrative authority can organize national men's secondary school ball game competitions in years when the National Games are not held, then there may be no need to divide men's ball games into groups during the National Games. In short, regarding whether ball game competitions should be divided into groups, and what the best method is without increasing the difficulties of the organizing committee and participating units, I do not yet have a satisfactory plan to contribute. However, this suggestion is made in good faith and should be regarded as a preliminary opinion. Whether it is necessary or appropriate is a matter for consideration. I hope that the experts from various units will offer their guidance.</p>
<h3>Fu Baolu Will Compete</h3>
<p>It was previously reported that pole vaulting athlete Fu Baolu's performance has declined due to a lack of practice, and he planned not to participate in this National Games. According to Mr. Fu's statement to the reporter yesterday, he will still compete and try his skills.</p>
<h3>Zhu Jiahao Hosts Banquet for Representatives and Organizing Committee Staff Tonight at 6 PM at the New Asia Hotel</h3>

<h3>Various Aspects of the National Games: The Cigarette Association's Notice</h3>
<p>Although smoking and alcohol are not suitable for the sports world, it seems necessary to have some embellishments for the audience serving the congress. The Chinese Cigarette Maintenance Association has erected a signboard near the Public Security Bureau on Xiangduan Road, which serves as a slogan to inform the Chinese people that they should smoke Chinese cigarettes. Many shops in the venue also sell famous domestic cigarettes of various brands, such as the Honglan Baisi Gan of the Huamei Tobacco Company, the Lushan brand of the Hexing Tobacco Company, and the Platinum Dragon of the Nanyang Tobacco Company, which are well received by the audience.</p>

Team leaders from Xinjiang, Mongolia, Tibet, Guangxi, Yunnan, Guizhou, Chahar, Suiyuan, and Shanxi, as well as cultural figures, attended. Wang Huiming, the editor-in-chief of the society, delivered a welcome speech, followed by a response from the representative of Xinjiang. Representatives from Guizhou and Guangxi also responded. Famous writers Xiang Peiliang and Fang Qiuzhang also gave speeches. The event was extremely lively, and the guests dispersed after a joyful evening. It is also reported that the society will publish a special issue on the National Games in its next issue (the 18th).</p>

To satisfy the curiosity of the public, the trophies, along with news photos of the 6th National Games, are displayed daily in the window of the Chinese Underwear Company at the west end of Shilu Road on Nanjing Road, starting today. It is said that those who come to visit are very enthusiastic.</p>
<h3>An Interview with a Champion: The Sporting History of Zheng Yinjiao</h3>
<p>Madam Deng Yinjiao, a female track and field athlete from Malaya, broke the national record in the broad jump with a score of 5.06 meters at this National Games. She also achieved fourth place in the 50-meter dash. Today, she will compete in the 100-meter race against famous athletes such as Li Senjiao and Wang Qianxing. People in Shanghai have long had a good impression of Madam Deng's achievements. Yesterday, a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency met Madam Deng at the athletic field. Initially, I was concerned about potential communication difficulties due to dialect differences, but I soon learned that Miss Deng speaks fluent Mandarin. In fact, most of the athletes from Malaya speak very good Mandarin. Madam Deng appears to be nearsighted and often wears glasses. Although not exceptionally beautiful, she is healthy and lovely. Madam Deng is only 29 years old, born in Siam, and has lived in Penang for a long time. She graduated from the Fujian Girls' High School in Malaya, where literature was her specialty. She currently teaches at a school in Penang. She has a mother, elder brother, and two younger sisters at home. According to her, she only started practicing sports this year. In the Third Malayan Overseas Chinese Games, she won championships in the 50-meter, 100-meter, 200-meter, and broad jump events, breaking the national record in the broad jump with a score of 5.125 meters. She only underwent considerable training in the month before the National Games. Currently, due to acclimatization issues, her physical condition is not optimal, resulting in a decline in performance. However, achieving such results without long-term training is truly remarkable. With Madam Deng's talent, her future is limitless.</p>
<h3>The Personal Life of Ye Suian</h3>
<p>Ye Suian, the Malayan athlete who won the men's broad jump championship yesterday, was greatly appreciated by the audience for his graceful posture. After he received his award and left the field, the reporter intended to interview him, but he disappeared in an instant. I went to the Liangjiang Dormitory but did not find him. I met Mr. Huang Shuangren, the team manager, who is also a colleague of Mr. Ye, and therefore knew his situation in great detail. According to Mr. Huang, Mr. Ye is 23 years old, from Kuala Lumpur, Penang, Malaya. He graduated from Chung Ling High School and is now working at his alma mater. Both of his parents have passed away. He has a younger brother who is also studying at Chung Ling High School. Mr. Ye enjoys practicing various sports. He participated in javelin and broad jump this time. His javelin performance in Malaya was 48 meters, and his broad jump reached over 7 meters. He also comes easily and effortlessly. His performance declined this time due to the impact of acclimatization issues. Mr. Ye is naturally intelligent, and his grades in various subjects are among the best in school. He is also kind and amiable, truly a promising talent. However, due to unfavorable family circumstances, he was unable to pursue further education. This is his first time returning to the country.</p>
<h3>Quick Sketches from the Venue</h3>
<p>It Takes More Than Fate to Bring Enemies Together: Miss Li Sen and Miss Deng Yinjiao competed in the broad jump the day before yesterday, one winning first place and the other second. In the 50-meter dash, one won first place and the other fourth. Yesterday, in the 100-meter preliminary, the two ladies met again. It really takes more than fate to bring enemies together.</p>
<p>The Trend of the Stands is About to Shift: The seats in the stands costing one yuan or more are located to the left and right of the east and west command platforms, in a moderate location, looking left and right, all are suitable. However, those under eight corners, especially those at two corners, are in the north and south poles. You can only see one corner of the venue. In recent days, because there were national martial arts competitions on the north side, the audience was crowded. The south side was deserted with few people. Today, Tan Meiguan's bicycle performance will be held on the south side, so I think the trend will definitely shift.</p>
<p>A Misunderstanding: Shandong Eats Maidong: There was a football match between Shandong and Guangdong yesterday morning. When the announcer was reporting, the sound was unclear due to a problem with the loudspeaker. The audience heard it as "Shandong eats Maidong."</p>
<p>Many Malaysian Athletes Have Stuffed Noses: Malaysian athletes are used to the heat of the tropics. This is the first time they have come north, and they feel uncomfortable with the climate. According to a staff member of the team yesterday, after the Malaysian athletes arrived here, they all suffered from a nasal condition.</p>
<p>Jiangsu and Zhejiang Ladies on the Phone: There are not many public telephones outside the venue. The ladies from Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai used the telephone the most. Yesterday, when a lady was on the phone, she quickly closed the door tightly. Her companion pulled the door open, causing the lady to blush with embarrassment.</p>
<p>Guangdong Girls Debut with Cheerleading Songs: Cheerleaders appeared for the first time in the various ball game competitions in the past three days. It was during the Guangdong vs. Qingdao women's basketball game. Many Guangdong ladies cheered on the field and played cheerleading songs, filling the air with pleasant sounds.</p>
<p>Jerseys Worn Inside Out with Strange Numbers: The jerseys of the Jilin Province basketball team are different from others, with a swimsuit style made of thread, empty spaces on the sides of the chest, and number cloths nailed on. The white vests inside have the words "Jilin" attached to the holes. It can be called unique. Yesterday, a player hurriedly wore the jersey inside out, the number was strange, and could not be recognized, and everyone could not stop laughing.</p>

<h3>Securities and Bonds: Market Still Difficult to Improve</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange's flat situation had not yet escaped a state of flux. Changes should occur next week. Surface No. 48 still seemed to be bought, but it was impossible to verify whether it was secretly sold off. The future of the bond market has not escaped danger. The 96 spot suddenly had more than 500,000 in transactions, and the Bank of China stock suddenly had a purchase and sale of one thousand several hundred shares, which seemed quite surprising. The public internal relationship probably has to do with accounts and has no problem with the market. Yesterday, the opening saw very strong selling pressure. Numbers 5, 11, 14, and 22 saw considerable selling, while number 43 was uniquely strong in buying oil, which helped maintain the market price, but it still fell by one to four corners. Although the second session rose slightly, the later figures trended weak again, by about one or two corners. In the afternoon opening, numbers 33 and 54, etc., saw selling, while numbers 24 and 69, etc., saw slight buying, a little less than one or two corners. At the close, various futures rebounded slightly by one or two corners, while the 96 spot suddenly had a large transaction. Number 4 was selling, and numbers 69, 72, 74, and 77 were buying from four firms. At the same time, Bank of China stock also had a large transaction. In summary, the market price resulted in a slight decrease of five fen to four corners. The total number of transactions was 9,646,000 yuan, of which Bank of China stock was 1,400 shares. The resulting increase and decrease are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Automobile Stocks Traded Frequently</h3>

The small exchange market rose, with a total of 2,050,000 shares traded throughout the day. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed below:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Imported Cotton Weak, Cotton Yarn Selling Pressure Increased Again</h3>
<p>The previously stable yarn market now showed obvious signs of fatigue. The market trend softened slightly, mainly because the situation of overseas cotton industries was increasingly weakening, and with the fading of European war clouds, people's minds were inevitably weakening. Moreover, the rampant rumors of inflation the previous day were all groundless rumors. The market price fell step by step. However, the amount of yarn in storage has, until recently, left about 4,300 packages in stock, which is half less than the number at the end of last month.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Falls One Yuan and More</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning session of the marked yarn, all months fell in unison because U.S. cotton continued to fall by six to ten pounds and the rumors of currency increases were all empty talk. The market was turbulent. Although buyers resisted at one point, the second and third sessions saw a rebound of several corners. By the time of closing, it was reported that the marked gold was flat, with each month falling by four, five, and six corners. As a result, each month's closing price was down by four, six, and eight corners compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was still flat. When it came to the second and third sessions, it still fluctuated in the range of two or three corners. However, by the time of closing, the market was depressed. With Osaka's three-product yarn falling, the market was bearish and the selling pressure increased slightly. The three households of He Xing, Chang Chang, and Xin Cheng sold particularly strongly. As a result, each month fell by four, six, and seven corners compared to the morning closing price. It was found that He Xing sold 1,300 packages, Tai Xing 600 packages, Chang Feng 1,900 packages, Run Kang 1,750 packages, Xin Cheng 1,200 packages, Da Ji 750 packages, and Yong Da 400 packages. Da Fu bought 600 packages, Tong Fu 400 packages, Jin Chang 500 packages, Chang Yu 550 packages, Shen Ji 1,150 packages, Ren Feng 650 packages, Yuan Da 500 packages, Zhen Da 450 packages, and Heng Chang 450 packages.

<p>Spot Yarn: Hunan and Guangdong Continued to Handle Spot Yarn Sales Were Still Good, Hunan and Guangdong gangs handled most of it. The total transaction statistics for all gangs throughout the day were 826 packages. The market was the same as the previous day. The purchase amounts for each gang are listed below:</p>

<p>Longs Spit Out, Cotton Market Weakens Slightly</p>
<p>The cotton market weakened slightly because Indian and American cotton continued to fall and the marked gold price fell back. People's minds were fatigued and the longs spit out, resulting in an oversupply in the market. However, Ruida's longs were still holding on tightly.</p>
<p>Chang He and Chang Feng Settle Longs</p>
<p>At the opening of the morning session of the marked cotton, the market was dull because overseas American cotton continued to fall by ten pounds, Indian cotton also fell by 0.25 to 1 rupee, and the marked gold market was calm. People's minds were weak, buyers were lacking, and the market was bleak. Transactions within the market were sparse. As a result, each month fell by five fen to one corner compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was still flat. After the second session, it entered a slump because the three-product cotton in Shanghai fell by one corner to six and a half corners. Imported cotton was still expected to fall and people were more relaxed. Chang He and Chang Feng sold out their longs. As a result, each month fell by one corner to one and a half corners compared to the morning closing price. However, this month rose by one corner. It was found that Da Fu sold 3,100 dan, Chang He 2,900 dan, Chang Feng 2,900 dan, Run Kang 1,500 dan, Yi Kang 1,000 dan, Shen Ji 800 dan, Xin Cheng 900 dan, and Xie Cheng 600 dan. Zhen Da bought 1,100 dan, Yuan Da 900 dan, Da Feng 1,000 dan, Yu Da 500 dan, Da 500 dan, Yuan Yi 1,800 dan, Xin Ting 2,200 dan, Shen Chang 2,500 dan, and Yuan Xing Chang 2,000 dan.

<h3>American Cotton Hedging Sales Increase</h3>
<p>Yesterday, at the opening of American cotton, all months rose by one to four pounds. Trading was sluggish. Prices were firm due to limit-price buying by peers and buying by Liverpool gangs. Later, due to the lack of external buyers and increased hedging sales, prices weakened. The weather was favorable, the temperature was high, there was no frost, and there was a need for current activities. The footing was firm and textiles were calm. Production and sales were equal. Hester estimated that the factory would use 160,000 packages this year. Liverpool's inventory was 121,000 packages. The closing was flat and weak. Spot prices fell by ten pounds, and futures fell by six to eleven pounds. British cotton spot prices rose by three points, and futures rose by one or two points. Indian cotton was bought by multiple manipulators and retail longs settled. Later, prices were firm due to good news from Liverpool. Pingguo'er and Aomu La rose by 0.025 rupees, and Bai Luo Creek rose by 1 rupee. The original telegram is recorded on the left (October 11 telegram):</p>

<h3>North-South Goods: Dried Longan Meat Rises Again by 35 Yuan</h3>
<p>Dried longan meat has recently seen few arrivals, sales are still smooth, and local prices are seeing peaks. Therefore, the market in Shanghai is gradually rising. Yesterday, raw dried longan meat opened at 70 yuan, up another 3 yuan, and Hainan dried longan meat also opened at 65 yuan, up 5 yuan.</p>

<h3>Grain: More Floating Orders Slightly Offloaded, Wheat Flour Fluctuates Slightly in Near and Distant Terms</h3>
<p>The flour market has eased because imported wheat is quoted at 10 cents in Chicago and about 20 cents in Canada. The market sentiment is such that imported wheat has fallen slightly, and since the market has been good, actual sales have not seen large-scale activity. Therefore, speculative longs are inevitably watching and waiting, so trading is not strong and the market is slightly soft. By the time the afternoon session opened, rumors of domestic security issues emerged again, causing buying interest to become even more sluggish and the market to become flat and weak. Afternoon trading also only amounted to about 200,000 packages, which is vastly different from the lively situation of the previous days.</p>
<p>November 11 November 12 Comparison</p>

<p>March 2.8100 2.7975 Down 0.0125</p>
<p>After the wheat market flurry, each month reached a steady state. Imported wheat quotations fell slightly by one or two corners. General speculative buyers, because it was Saturday and the risk was quite high, cleared their trades. Some floating orders were sold off, and near and distant terms each went down by one or two fen. The future situation still depends on overseas conditions for change. Spot wheat is still stable, and the amount delivered reached 8,000 packages. Because the quality of the goods varied, they were all distributed by Fuxin. The other factories did not inquire. Shandong wheat opened at 4.4 yuan, Jiangbei wheat at 4.38 yuan, and Shaoxing wheat at 4.16 yuan.</p>

<h3>Cloudy Weather Changes: Round Grain Supply Falls Short of Demand</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, sources from various gangs still arrived with more than 40 numbers (more than 8,000 shi of goods in total). Because the weather turned cloudy, stores on the main street continued to move their stomachs. However, the Yantai gang only handled about 3-400 packages of old and new goods, so the overall situation was difficult to show improvement. The market for thick and thin broken rice did not see honor or disgrace, and their packages went down only 2 corners. In cloudy weather, Baige and other new thin rice and thick new japonica rice did not see any difference. Because Du pointed rice's footing was firm and the way out was easy, the price rose by 1 corner, and foreign pointed rice followed suit by several fen. The supply of new and old round grain suddenly fell short of demand, and prices rose by 1-2 corners.</p>
<p>November 11 November 12 Up/Down</p>
<p>Sijing Broken Package 10.90 10.70 Up 2 Corners</p>
<p>Su Tong Yang Point 8.85 8.90 Up 5 Fen</p>
<p>Su Tong Point 8.90 9.00 Up 1 Corner</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sources from various routes downstream of the river were prosperous, about 50-60 numbers. The way out for various goods on the market was flat. Only foreign, port, and guest pointed rice were still actively traded. White round grain was transformed into flat, and the market for broken japonica rice weakened by several fen to 1 corner. Except for a small corner increase in the price of new japonica rice, sheep and Du pointed rice were stable. The ports and guests were slightly tighter by several fen. The white round grain was stable, and the prices of thin and slightly inferior varieties did not see honor or disgrace.</p>
<h3>Imported and Local Xian Rice Sales Active</h3>
<p>The appetite for guest xian rice was still strong on the main street yesterday. In addition to囤 households, actual sales were also active. The northern gangs also slightly responded. However, the arrival of guest xian rice was very prosperous. New shipments from Anhui, Hunan, Hubei, Ningbo, Shaoxing and other places arrived, so the market was in a stable state. The main street was even busier in the afternoon. Ningbo, Jianghu, and white rice rose sharply by 5-6 fen, and other varieties rose by 2-3 fen. Throughout the day, more than 100 packages of Gan rice, 450 packages of Hunan and Hubei rice, 220 packages of Anqing rice, 115 packages of Shaoxing rice, and more than 1,300 packages of Yong rice were sold, most of which were handled by the main street.</p>
<p>Imported Rice: The digestion on the main street was very active yesterday, especially small-grained rice, which was competed for by both 囤 households and actual sales. The price rose by 3-4 fen in the afternoon, and more than 2,000 packages were sold. Saigon rice opened at 650 packages, and Siam round rice opened at 100 packages. Later, the situation was both strong.</p>
<h3>Sesame and Green Beans Sold Vigorously Overseas</h3>
<p>The miscellaneous grains were created by the favorable situation overseas. However, because purchasing power was thin and transportation was slight, the market was 秀. Yesterday, Yihua continued to order 500 tons of sesame for delivery in November and December, with prices opening at 9.3 yuan and 9.5 yuan, respectively. The market was raised by half a yuan compared to the market three days ago. The spot price in the market was even more lively. New yellow beans also rose by 5-6 fen due to high oil prices. More than 4,000 packages of various beans were traded. The way out was that factories, Fuzhou, the interior, and the main street all had inquiries. The Yantai gang handled new tea beans quite grandly. The southern seas were also not weak, so the market tightened. Yesterday, more than 1,000 packages of various Ming and Mao tea vegetables were traded in the market.</p>
<h3>Oil Market: The Rising Trend of Hundred Tung Oil Gradually Subsides</h3>
<p>Since last week, the foreign firms in the Wuhan market have raised the price of white 柂 oil to 87 yuan per box. Adequate goods have been completely swept away. Therefore, all transactions this week were for insufficient goods. Although the prices were said to have fallen, the actual adequate goods were probably above 87 yuan. However, the goods have already been sold out, so all were scattered and cannot be regarded as a proper market. Now, old oil has become a relic in the market, waiting for new goods. The foreign firms are being somewhat deliberate with futures, so the attitude is quite calm, and is no longer as demanding as it was half a month ago. The main reason is that people are worried about the high prices, fearing that the new oil will not be as lively as the old oil when it comes to the market in the future. It is not yet known.</p>
<h3>Raw Soybean Oil Breaks the 16 Yuan Mark</h3>
<p>The market for soybean oil and peanut oil continued to rise sharply and has now broken through the 16 yuan mark. The sentiment in the city is still excited. Yesterday, the market for raw soybean oil was re-engraved by 2-3 corners, for a total of 1,250 pieces of various soybean oils and 1,200 pieces of various peanut oils.</p>
<h3>Cottonseed Oil Nears 35 Yuan</h3>
<p>Cottonseed oil was also skyrocketing due to the soaring prices of soybean oil in recent days. It seemed impossible to stop. Although refined oil was once sold for 14.5 yuan, because the number of transactions was small, only a dozen dan, it was not considered a proper market. The main street was again fragrant yesterday. The factory took this into consideration and raised the market price to 14.95 yuan, with 500 dan traded.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: More Than 500 Packages of Domestic Red and White Sugar Opened</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was firm. The association divided the board. 24 coarse sand spot goods called up 5 fen to 17.7 yuan. Transshipment goods 5.7 yuan, no transaction. No. 9 Dutch Red Transshipment Goods KD Mark 5.3 yuan, already done. The factory's fine white had no major changes. Zhenji No. 1 was still 16.8 yuan, and the rest followed the rebate. Dongbai No. 9 SHTM Mark was all called 17.5 yuan, and transshipment goods were 5.5 yuan, no transaction. No. 8 was called 17.6 yuan, and the transshipment goods YT Mark was called 5.6 yuan, with slight transactions. The domestic miscellaneous white sugar numbers opened more than 500 packages. The higher white sugar was 10 corners, 14.6 yuan, and the higher red sugar was 13.3 yuan, which was reduced. Zhuang Qing opened over 11.2 yuan, an increase of 1, with transactions.</p>

<p>Children's Weekly</p>
<h3>Two Stories Recalling Premier's Childhood</h3>
<p>— Ji Yijie</p>
<p>Time flies swiftly, and the National Day of the Republic of China in the twenty-fourth year has passed again. When commemorating National Day, I thought of the Premier, who arduously created the Republic of China, and his words and actions throughout his life. Now, I will write down two commendable stories from the Premier's childhood below. Undoubtedly, the children who read this will surely praise them.</p>
<p>(1) In the third year of the Guangxu reign of the former Qing Dynasty, a large residence in Cui Ting Village, Xiangshan, was broken into and robbed by thieves. The Premier was only eleven years old at the time and was studying in school. Upon hearing the sound of doors being broken down and walls collapsing, he and seven or eight classmates went outside to see what was happening. The rest of the students were so frightened that they ran back to the school gate with their heads in their hands. The Premier alone stood still, watching the robbery and showing a thoughtful and resentful expression. Later, he saw the thieves carrying boxes and other items away, shouting and whistling. Then, the sighs, cries, and inquiries of the people in the large residence and the villagers arose one after another. The Premier said to the owner of the house, "Old sir, why don't we have people to protect us?" The owner was stunned and unable to answer. The Premier then asked the crowd, "Why don't we have people to protect us? Do you all feel that way?" The villagers also shook their heads, unable to answer.</p>
<p>(2) When the Premier was twelve years old, the Yang family garden in Cui Ting Village was seized. The three brothers who owned the garden were arrested by Qing soldiers for unknown reasons. When they were arrested, the eldest brother had already been beaten to the point of being on the verge of death, and the garden site had also been occupied by the soldiers. When the Premier returned home from school and passed by the area, he met a gardener wandering by the roadside. After inquiring about the situation, he learned that the three Yang brothers had never interfered in external affairs, had not committed any crimes, and were unjustly arrested by the soldiers, who then occupied their garden. Deeply dissatisfied, the Premier stepped into the garden but was stopped by an officer with a sword. The Premier said, "This is the Yang family garden. The brothers are good friends of my family. I am here to play and visit the three brothers." The officer said, "This is not their place. You cannot come here to play." The Premier said, "I am here to play with my friends in their garden. They are always very nice to me. This is their garden. Why can't I play here?" The officer suddenly became furious and said, "What?" The Premier also changed to a firm attitude and said to the officer, "I ask you, why did you arrest them? Why did you kill their eldest brother?" The officer was questioned to the point of being embarrassed and angry and drew his sword, saying to the Premier, "Little boy, you come to play in the garden. I will teach you a way to play." Seeing this situation, the Premier knew that there was no reasoning to be done, and he said sternly, "Don't think that just because you have a knife, you can forcibly seize other people's gardens. This garden belongs to the three Yang brothers!" As he spoke, he walked towards the garden gate with large strides, muttering to himself, "There are such hateful officials. Alas, why are there such hateful officials? Why does everyone allow such hateful officials to run rampant?"</p>
<p>Due to space limitations, I cannot write more. In short, the Premier's greatness could already be seen in his childhood. Children who read the newspaper, put yourselves in his shoes and think about it. The Premier already had such courage in his childhood. Why don't we have it? The Premier is a person, and so am I. How should we cultivate ourselves to learn from the Premier?</p>
<h3>Qiqiao Collage for Double Tenth Festival</h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>The Double Tenth Festival is worthy of celebration. Let's make a qiqiao collage.</p>
<p>Before you start, you need to prepare the following items:</p>
<p>(1) Colored paper (2) White paper (3) Scissors (4) Ruler (5) Paste (6) Pencil</p>
<p>Children, these things are easy to obtain, so this kind of toy is also very easy to make, isn't it?</p>
<p>First, use a pencil to draw lines on the colored paper according to figures A and B, and then cut them out with scissors. The pieces cut out according to figure A can be assembled into the characters "2" "10" "13," and the pieces cut out according to figure B can be assembled into the characters "4" "Year." Paste them all on the white paper, and it becomes the "24th year Double Tenth," doesn't it? If the colors are well matched, it will also look very good.</p>
<p>Children, isn't this kind of toy very fun?</p>
<h3>Two Praiseworthy Children Who Bought Clothes for Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Twenty-two Pieces in Total Handed Over to the City Party Headquarters for Distribution</p>
<p>The severity of the floods and the large number of victims in various places this year, as well as the vastness of the disaster areas, are probably known to all of you children. Now that the autumn winds have started, these victims are cold without clothes to wear, hungry without food to eat, and of course, they have no place to live! Just imagine how miserable this situation is! We are all compatriots, so we naturally have to provide relief to them. Therefore, everyone has been busy with disaster relief this month, which is indeed our due responsibility.</p>
<p>Many of you children have very good environments. Amidst the nationwide call for disaster relief, you should embrace the attitude of "not lagging behind others in disaster relief" and participate in this disaster relief work. Now, let me introduce to you a letter from two children who were able to carry out disaster relief:</p>
<p>The Cui Jiu and Cui Zhong siblings saw the news about the floods in the newspaper and were greatly moved! They specially used the money they had saved to buy twenty-two pieces of winter clothing and sent them to the Nanjing City Party Headquarters for distribution. They also attached a handwritten letter, the original of which is as follows: "Dear Sirs, now that the autumn winds have risen, the victims living outdoors—especially those in the north—are in dire need of cotton clothing. My siblings and I are now using a little of the money we have saved to make some cotton clothes for them to use, including five large cotton-padded coats and trousers, five small cotton-padded coats and trousers, and two small cotton robes, totaling twenty-two pieces, divided into two bundles, and sent to your office. Please be sure to send them to Shandong within a month for us to distribute to the victims. We hope that this request will be agreed to by the gentlemen. Sincerely, your children, Cui Jiu and Cui Zhong."</p>
<p>Children, these two children—Cui Jiu and Cui Zhong—are so worthy of praise! I hope you will also follow their example and not let them have all the glory.</p>

<h3>Ask Yourself</h3>
<p>— Wang Ji, Chun'an County Qingxi Central Elementary School</p>
<p>October 10th is China's National Day. On this day, all Chinese citizens should celebrate. However, at this time, one must also ask oneself:</p>
<p>Youths in school: Ask yourselves, how much money have I spent this year? Have I really read enough books? Am I worthy of the parents and teachers who have cultivated me?</p>
<p>Those engaged in agriculture, industry, and commerce: Ask yourselves, how much sweat and blood have I shed for labor this year? How have my hands and feet suffered? Is there any price that can comfort myself?</p>
<p>Those with political responsibilities: What have I said this year? Have my words and actions been consistent? Have I really accomplished a few percent of what I said? Am I worthy of the country and the people?</p>
<p>Besides these, we must also ask: How many years has the Northeast been in decline? When will our rivers and mountains be returned to us?</p>
<p>Please think about the above questions, ask them, and see if you can answer them. I think that not only will no one be able to answer them, but perhaps everyone is busy celebrating and has no time to pay attention to them?</p>
<h3>National Day and National Humiliation</h3>
<p>— Lu Zuan, Pudong Jingcun Elementary School</p>
<p>The great National Day is so glorious. On this day twenty-four years ago, our Premier spent decades of effort to launch the Wuchang Uprising, overthrowing the corrupt Qing government and creating this joyous National Day.</p>
<p>On National Day, we should celebrate. However, do not forget the painful days of national humiliation. In recent years, our national humiliations have only increased. Think of the September 18th Incident and the January 28th Incident; how shameful were these two incidents!</p>
<p>From today onwards, we must work hard! We must fight! We must wash away the many national humiliations!</p>
<h3>From Today Onward, A Fifteen-Year-Old Girl From Longhu Elementary School</h3>
<p>— Shen Yanying</p>
<p>Today is the most glorious National Day commemorative day. Originally, it should be celebrated; however, with the nationwide floods being so severe and tragic, how can we be happy? Also, our teacher told us that a second world war is about to break out. We must study hard and exercise well so that we can do essential rear area work in the future!</p>
<p>Therefore, from today onward, I will try my best to save the pocket money I use to buy candy to help the victims and will never waste a single penny again.</p>
<p>From today onward, I will study hard, seek knowledge, and exercise to prepare for doing rear area work during the Second World War.</p>
<p>In addition, from today onward, I will study science because "science" is the best weapon to save the country!</p>
<h3>I Want to Create a New China</h3>
<p>— Chi Buyin</p>
<p>I am the master of the new China,</p>
<p>I will firm my aspirations,</p>
<p>Whatever responsibilities I must fulfill,</p>
<p>Friends!</p>
<p>I will bear them on my shoulders!</p>
<p>Good winds blow me forward,</p>
<p>The sun shines on my victory.</p>
<p>I want to create a new China,</p>
<p>To be its master,</p>
<p>Whatever responsibilities I must fulfill,</p>
<p>Friends!</p>
<p>I will bear them on my shoulders.</p>
<h3>National Day Reflections</h3>
<p>— Cao Meiying, Shanghai Wanzhu Elementary School</p>
<p>The Xinhai Revolution was created by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and October 10th was designated as China's National Day, called the Double Tenth Festival. The Republic of China has been established for twenty-four Double Tenth Festivals. National Day comes every year, but from the past Double Tenth Festivals until now, what in the "country, society, education, family," and everything else is worth celebrating?</p>
<p>I am a third-grade elementary school student, only eleven years old this year. I do not understand the events of the past, but I remember that on my first National Day after entering school, the teacher said, "Today is the Double Tenth Festival, and school is closed for one day." He led the students out for a parade to show celebration. Every year after that, such a celebration was held, but there were no other performances, and I did not understand what the meaning of National Day was!</p>
<p>Four days before National Day was Sunday. I was at home, and my father told me about National Day, and I understood that October 10th is the most glorious National Day of the Republic of China. The Double Tenth Festival is a national holiday that the people should celebrate together, but I often see the newspapers my father brings back, which are full of news about "domestic floods, droughts, bank and store closures, robberies, rapes, murders, abductions, divorces, escapes," and so on, which I see every day. Now, two foreign countries are fighting a war with gunfire, and the refugees, supporting the old and carrying the young, are crying all the way, just like the tragic events of September 18th and January 28th in our country, all of which are cruel tragedies created by power. I shouldn't write these words on this happy National Day, but I hope that everyone will happily spend the twenty-fifth Double Tenth Festival, and long live China.</p>
<h3>Children's National Day Song</h3>
<p>— Written by Yin Yiqiu</p>
<h3>The Story of the White Mountain Crow (5)</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>I wanted to summon my courage anew, not intending to look like a backward old hen, but after flying for a while, I could no longer support myself.</p>
<p>I murmured again, "Sir, can we stop here for a while? I am terribly thirsty, which causes me great pain. If we could stop on a tree..."</p>
<p>The carrier pigeon said angrily, "Damn! Damn! You are really a mountain bird!" And so he flew higher and higher, without even turning his head, and continued his journey. As for me, I was dizzy and fell into a rice field.</p>
<p>I don't know how long I was unconscious. When I regained consciousness, the only thing I remembered was the last words of the carrier pigeon; he said to me, "You are really a mountain bird!" Therefore, I thought in my heart, "Ah! My dear parents, you were wrong! I must come back to you so you can acknowledge me as a loyal and law-abiding child and still let me live in a small pile of beloved leaves under my mother's belly."</p>
<p>I struggled to get up, but I was very tired along the way, and I fell again, which caused pain in my limbs. My feet had not yet stood firmly, and a wave of dizziness made me fall again.</p>
<p>A kind of fear of death arose in my heart. Unexpectedly, between the cornflowers and poppies, I saw two very lovely friends gently walking towards me. One was a small magpie with a very clean body and a very suave appearance, and the other was a rose-colored turtledove. The turtledove stood a few steps away, holding a very humble attitude and expressing great sympathy for my misfortune. But the magpie jumped to my side, showing the most beautiful posture in the world.</p>
<p>It released a silver bell-like voice and said to me, "Oh! Poor child, what are you doing here?"</p>
<p>I replied, "Alas! My noble lady, I am a poor traveler, abandoned on the roadside, and now I am about to starve to death."</p>
<p>It replied, "Heavens! Are you really so miserable?" It immediately jumped around in the surrounding bushes, going from here to there, and brought me a lot of fruit, piling them into a small heap next to me, while constantly asking me questions.</p>
<p>"But who are you? Where did you come from? What dangers have you faced? And where are you going now? You are very young and your feathers have only just grown well, yet you have set out alone! What do your parents do? How did they let you run around haphazardly? It really makes my feathers stand on end!"</p>

<h3>Women's Moral Society and Prostitute Reservation Vouchers</h3>
<p>— Luo Qiong</p>
<p>According to the October 10th issue of this newspaper, Mrs. Han (Gao Shengkun), the wife of Shandong Provincial Government Chairman Han, and others initiated the establishment of the Shandong Women's Moral Promotion Association. The reason for the initiation is: "In view of the fact that modern Chinese women, those who advocate reform only admire vanity and do not examine themselves, abandoning their inherent responsibilities; those who are conservative are weak and incompetent, with low knowledge, rigidly adhering to outdated habits, resulting in the inherent old morals being buried and hindered, and the true spirit of women being diminished and nothing remains. The more developed women's rights are, the more decadent life becomes. The more advanced civilization is, the more corrupt customs become." These many "words of wisdom" can indeed be said to be a portrayal of the Chinese women's world. Mrs. Han and others can so nakedly expose the shortcomings of the Chinese women's world, which is indeed worthy of our admiration.</p>
<p>However, here we must further investigate why "the more developed women's rights are, the more decadent life becomes," and "the more advanced civilization is, the more corrupt customs become," leading to "moral decline"? According to general common sense, the development of women's rights and the progress of civilization are symbols of moral improvement and prerequisites for improving life; however, the current situation is the opposite. This is mainly because the so-called "women's rights" of modern times are only the women's rights of a few people, and the so-called "civilization" of modern times is only the civilization of a few people. As for the majority of women, what they receive is only barbaric oppression. The more developed this one-sided "women's rights" and "civilization" become, the more profound the gap between the rich and the poor becomes. Therefore, the majority of women, under the oppression of this "women's rights" and "civilization," are becoming increasingly impoverished and have no choice but to sell their bodies in overt or covert forms to maintain their livelihood.</p>
<p>Here we do not need to list many facts to prove it, just look at the Putian dispatch in the Chongqing Commercial Daily on the first of this month! "Putian, Fujian, is now filled with prostitutes, and they are everywhere in groups. The source of these prostitutes is that 'the homes of rural people have been destroyed by civil war, they have fled, they are unemployed, they are homeless, they are starving and freezing, men cannot find work, so women are forced by life to sell their bodies in the city in exchange for a mouthful of food to maintain their pitiful lives... They have no choice but to go to the streets to attract customers in order to survive. Furthermore, after such a large increase in prostitutes, it is extremely difficult to receive customers, so the competition among prostitutes for customers is naturally more intense... The usual methods for prostitutes to treat customers favorably are large discounts and large gifts, but these methods are still not enough to attract customers' interest, so prostitutes implement a 'buy one get one free' method, where two people prostitute, only one person needs to pay; one person prostitutes today, and next time they can prostitute for free without paying. But this doesn't seem to be good enough, so in the past two months, some prostitutes have even issued a kind of reservation voucher (each voucher costs one yuan or half a yuan). Anyone who uses a reservation voucher to prostitute not only gets a cheaper price, but also does not have to pay tips, making it half as expensive to prostitute than usual... Now, there is simply no prostitute who does not sell reservation vouchers. The circulation of sexual intercourse reservation vouchers in Putian City is actually more than banknotes."</p>
<p>After reading the above dispatch, we no longer need any explanation. We can know that women's "moral degradation and bad customs" are not simply a moral problem, but a socio-economic problem: moral degradation is based on an extremely serious economic crisis. Therefore, we believe that only after true "women's rights" and true "civilization" are realized, that is, after all people obtain equal political and economic rights, can the so-called women's morality be thoroughly resolved. The ancients said, "Only when the granaries are full do people know etiquette, and only when they have enough food and clothing do they know honor and disgrace," which probably has the same meaning! From this perspective, the extent to which the Shandong Women's Moral Promotion Association can have any practical effect is entirely a question.</p>
<h3>Returning from the National Games</h3>
<p>— Wu</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Someone once told me this: A certain athlete wrote him a short message, and in the mere forty-odd characters, there were actually eighteen misspelled words.</p>
<p>Someone else once said to me this: In some schools in Shanghai, "sports" has almost been used as a tool to compete for "glory" and "dominance" in society. They treat a group of top athletes like ancestors, not requiring them to pay tuition fees, nor requiring them to attend classes, and it doesn't matter if they don't go to school for years, as long as they "are willing" to understand the authorities' painstaking efforts of "raising soldiers for a thousand days, using them for a moment," and give them a good show on the sports field when the time comes.</p>
<p>But at the time of hearing it, I was indeed somewhat indifferent because this era has fundamentally negated the era of being able to close oneself off like in the past. The books that schools let students read are not necessarily useful, and the real practical textbooks are still this realistic society.</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>This time, the National Games opened, and like others, I silently expressed my joy in my heart.</p>
<p>When the second day noon arrived, I squeezed and squeezed among the thousands and thousands of intoxicated and frenzied spectators and entered the sports field.</p>
<p>However, when I came out—that is, after I finished watching the programs I wanted to see and retreated—I finally felt somewhat choked. I remembered what my friend told me, and I felt its meaning. Isn't the larger venue than the school also grasping at "sports" in this way?</p>
<p>Here, I don't dare to expand the issue. I just want to talk about our own women's affairs. In this day and age, perhaps only talking about one's own affairs will not be severely resented and resisted.</p>
<p>The women's programs I saw that day were the 50-meter preliminaries and semi-finals. The preliminaries were divided into four groups, and each time each group reached the finish line, applause louder than spring thunder would erupt as usual.</p>
<p>When it was the semi-finals' turn, the mood of the entire venue seemed to become even tenser.</p>
<p>When the second group started the race, ×× was initially behind others, and no one paid attention to her, but when she was only ten-odd yards away from the finish line, she suddenly rushed to the front and took the lead, breaking the national record with a time of six seconds.</p>
<p>Then, people's attention was instantly focused entirely on that young lady wearing a white sports uniform.</p>
<p>The applause and cheers from the audience erupted like a whirlwind and storm for a while.</p>
<p>A group of photographers rushed over to take pictures of her.</p>
<p>Her name was transmitted through the loudspeaker loudly and clearly.</p>
<p>She smiled, smiling with satisfaction.</p>
<p>This, you know, if you carefully taste it, you should know what kind of social meaning is contained in the depths of it!</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>As I said before, I don't want to oppose and denounce the promotion of sports with the vile and low tone of those who preach that "sports stars don't love to read" or "the result is only cultivating useless talents," but I feel that we cannot ignore the premise of promoting sports. It goes without saying in some countries where people can already obtain true freedom and equality, but in China, especially in the current stage of China where the blood of many martyrs has been sacrificed and has only allowed a small number of intellectual women to raise their weak necks in society, our women should pay close attention to such promotion of sports.</p>
<p>The purpose of promoting sports is to strengthen the body and improve the race, but now, obviously, its development is deformed.</p>
<p>Every woman who strives in sports should know that in addition to striving in sports, the most important thing is to determine her own will, recognize society, and step into society; for the nation, for herself.</p>
<p>Otherwise, think for yourself, what is the difference between you and a monkey raised by a traveling performer who is treated as a toy and used as a tool to make money?</p>
<p>Youth is limited. Even if you can be lucky enough to live a period of carefree life by relying on your athletic skills, but, let me say it again! Youth is limited, and old age and weakness will take away everything from you!</p>
<p>The past is gone! In the future, I hope that any means that kill and deceive us will shatter like tiles when they fall on us.</p>

<h3>Going Home</h3>
<p>— Su Hong</p>
<p>And so they continued beating him until he was silent, like a dead snake. Everyone let him down and dragged him on the muddy ground. They patted his chest, bent his arms, tugged at his upper lip, and used chopsticks to pry open his mouth, pouring hot tea down his throat. Slowly, he began to wake up, groaning and opening his eyes slightly. Everyone lifted his upper body and leaned him against the trunk of a camphor tree.</p>
<p>"Now you can talk. Who is your leader?"</p>
<p>"I don't even know who the leader is," the bandit said slowly.</p>
<p>"How can you not know who your leader is when you are together?"</p>
<p>"I just know that the end of the year is coming, and we can't get through it. My family needs to eat, so we came together to rob," he said. He thought of his wife, his son, and his old mother. He looked at his swollen, purple hands that he could not move, and his numb, swollen ankles. His whole body ached, and tears began to flow.</p>
<p>Young Master Zhonggui gave another order: that he must be the leader, and to beat him again. The men took a board studded with a row of iron nails and beat him with it, pulling it across his body. Finally, they forcefully dragged it sideways.</p>
<p>A nanny came out, holding a bottle. She said that the old lady had made a "Jade Tree Divine Oil" to do good deeds, and told them to apply it to his wounds and told the men not to beat him anymore, and let him go.</p>
<p>"Uncle Lifu! Please pick a few branches from the Chinese cedar tree. We have rice to cook a big pot of porridge. Eat porridge here with us today, Aunt Lifu! You don't need to help." The sister-in-law saw Lifu walking over after beating the bandit. She thought she needed a man's help, so she should start building a relationship.</p>
<p>Uncle Lifu stood on the burned field, despondently dragging the Chinese cedar beam. He recalled what he had said yesterday: "Once it's burned, just let it burn..." He thought, "I was catching bandits for the Zans, guarding the foothills all night. If I had been home, this disaster might not have happened. We could have salvaged things when the fire started. Now everything is gone. Because I was helping tie up that bandit, I didn't even have time to move out a single piece of furniture. I've ended up empty-handed, helping others catch bandits, and beating him up like that..." He suddenly became angry, his stubbornness rising again. He clenched his fists, wanting to hit his wife again. But he looked at his wife, her hair disheveled and her face yellow, holding the child and sitting in the haystack. His hand naturally loosened. He held his head, wanting to roar, but ultimately sat down dejectedly on the ash heap. The sister-in-law said opportunistically:</p>
<p>"Uncle Lifu, you haven't slept all night, no wonder you have no strength. Come over, come sit on the straw, bask in the sun, and rest for a while."</p>
<p>He really stood up and walked to his wife's side and sat down. Coincidentally, Xiuzhen was also there. He turned his head and asked:</p>
<p>"Xiuzhen! How is Shanghai? Is there work?"</p>
<p>"Work? I came back because I didn't have work."</p>
<p>Xiuzhen originally worked in a yarn factory in Zhabei, Shanghai. She had also studied in night school for two years, and she understood many things. Later, the "January 28th" Incident occurred, and the yarn factory was burned down, leaving her unemployed. At first, she hoped to find work elsewhere, but she waited in vain for more than a year. Because life was too difficult, her body became like a white louse, and she had no choice but to return to her hometown, but returning to her hometown... She looked at the scene before her: a field of smoking ruins, reminiscent of the scenes after the battles in Zhabei. Now sitting among this group of people with the same fate, living the life of refugees again; neither the city nor the countryside had a place to live. She deeply realized that retreat and shrinking back were definitely not a way out. She moved a little closer to Lifu and said in a low voice, "If there is a chance, of course, we will find work. Right now, to fill our bellies, we can do one thing first, which is to gather together and ask Young Master Zhonggui for compensation. You should speak up. Because you caught the bandit for him, you didn't get a single thing out of the house."</p>
<p>Lifu nodded. He thought to himself, "Now I am willing to do anything, even if you told me to rob..."</p>
<p>The sun was shining, the ice was melting a little, and the crowd of homeless people were wriggling. (The End)</p>

<h3>Episode 5: The Issue of Women's Labor</h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>The issue of women's labor, simply put, encompasses all problems concerning the status and circumstances of working women. Its main content lies in improving working hours, wages, labor equipment, and other general labor conditions, and so on. This issue is a problem particularly related to women within the general labor issue. At the same time, because working women are women, it is naturally related to women's issues. Therefore, on the one hand, it is a branch of the broad labor issue, and on the other hand, it is contained within women's issues. In other words, the working women's movement, from the perspective of liberating the entire working masses, is a division of the general labor movement, and from the perspective of liberating the female masses, it becomes the central force of the entire women's movement.</p>
<p>The issue of women's labor, like the general labor issue, originated from the Industrial Revolution of the 18th and 19th centuries. As a result of the Industrial Revolution, on the one hand, the capitalist mechanical industry accelerated its development, requiring a large amount of wage labor. On the other hand, the self-sufficient feudal family economy collapsed, and the resources for family life had to be sought outside the family. As a result, tens of thousands of women, like men, were forced to become wage laborers for capitalists. Especially during the First World War and after the war, women's labor underwent unprecedented development. Even heavy industry sectors that had previously restricted women's labor saw the participation of many working women. To this day, the number of working women almost surpasses the number of male workers, and they are almost on par with male workers in terms of labor skill and technique. However, there are still gender differences in social status and labor conditions. That is, even for the same labor, the treatment and compensation for male workers are always more favorable than for female workers.</p>
<p>We can observe the serious social significance of the issue of women's labor from their labor conditions. Here, I would like to explain several of its main problems separately. The first is the issue of working hours. When men and women work in the same factory, their working hours are naturally the same. However, in some light industrial sectors that employ mainly female labor, women's working hours are always longer than those of male workers in the same sector. Although the eight-hour work system is now widely advocated, most places still adopt a ten-hour or even twelve-hour work system, except for a few advanced countries with a small number of places that implement it. Especially in China, in industrial sectors like yarn factories that employ a large number of female laborers, there are even fourteen-hour workdays, in addition to women's night work system. As a result, the majority of working women are prone to disease, which will further affect the health of the entire population. Originally, women, due to their physical condition, cannot engage in long-term, intense labor like men. If men demand an eight-hour work system, women should demand a six-hour or four-hour work system. However, under the exploitative system of capitalists who only care about profit and disregard the health of the people, this demand is certainly not easy to realize. As for the issue of night work for women and children, it was resolved to be prohibited at the International Labour Conference several years ago, but my country has not yet ratified it, and the majority of women are still subjected to the cruel exploitation of night work!</p>
<p>The second is the issue of wages. No matter what country it is, women's wages are always lower than those of male workers. Even in the same skill and the same labor setting, female workers' wages are less than two-thirds or even one-third of male workers' wages. In some cases, it is not given as their living expenses, but as pocket money. Therefore, the majority of female workers do not earn enough to support themselves. Regarding the reasons for the low wages of female workers, Omsu, the author of "Women's Issues Talks," pointed out the following seven points: (1) the ingrained notion that women are inferior to men; (2) women's productivity is relatively low; (3) female workers have a lower level of education; (4) women are accustomed to unpaid domestic labor; (5) female workers are mostly supplementing family living expenses; (6) there is a large reserve army of female workers behind female workers; (7) female workers' union organizations are not very developed.</p>
<p>The third is the issue of maternity protection. As mentioned above, working women work in unsanitary conditions for long periods of time, and their income is extremely low, and their lives in terms of clothing, food, and housing are very poor. Therefore, they all suffer from disasters and diseases, damage their female functions, and will not be able to complete the maternal task of the whole population. It is especially important to note that most of the female workers are unmarried women. Before they get married and have children, they are subjected to that kind of unlimited exploitation and abuse, which completely damages the health that motherhood should have. This is definitely not just a problem for female workers themselves, but a serious social problem.</p>
<p>As a result, in order to solve these problems, the liberation movement of working women arose. This movement began in Europe and the United States in the mid-19th century, and now it has merged with the entire social movement and the women's liberation movement, forming the main revolutionary front against the propertied class's social system.</p>
<p>The working women's movement was initially opposed to male workers. Because the workers in the early days had a very weak class consciousness, they regarded female workers as competing adversaries and excluded them, not allowing female workers to join the union. However, after the Paris Commune era in 1871, the workers gradually gained their own class worldview and social view. At the same time, they realized that the demands of female workers not only did not conflict with their interests, but were more in line with their demands. From then on, female workers were also able to participate in the union. Furthermore, they organized their own unions for female workers. Especially under the leadership of progressive political groups, they put forward their demands to society, and in order to implement their demands, they carried out mass struggles. At present, their special requirements are (1) the same work, the same pay; (2) prohibiting labor that is harmful to maternity; (3) giving two months of leave before and after childbirth, with full pay; (4) establishing free nurseries; (5) establishing a six-hour work system, etc. These requirements are the special requirements of female workers. Therefore, the so-called issue of women's labor, on the one hand, has the nature of the general labor issue, and on the other hand, has the nature of the women's liberation issue. At the same time, this problem can only be fundamentally solved in the entire social revolution.</p>

<h3>The Air Force Strength of Various Countries in the World</h3>
<p>— Bei Bi</p>
<p>The opening of hostilities between Italy and Abyssinia has opened the prelude to World War II. At this time, the military strength of various countries in the world, especially the air force strength, is worthy of special attention, because the victory or defeat of the war is mainly determined by the military, and the role of the air force in it is especially important. As everyone knows, the most powerful killing weapons in the last World War were torpedoes, submarines, and artillery, but the nature of World War II is mainly air warfare and chemical warfare. Therefore, when the god of war has descended in East Africa, probably everyone wants to know about the air force situation of various countries in the world.</p>
<p>However, the military preparations of various countries are very secret, and the strength of the air force is even more difficult for outsiders to explore. In terms of the navy, if a certain country has a certain number of warships, it can be openly identified and is not easy to hide, but the number of aircraft in that country is impossible for outsiders to know. At the same time, the construction of warships costs more and cannot be completed in a very short time, but the manufacture of aircraft is easier in all aspects; once a war breaks out, it is impossible to rush to build a certain number of warships, but it is more possible to rush to build a certain number of aircraft. Therefore, it is really difficult to judge the air force strength of various countries now. However, there is a general survey of the air force of the major countries in the world, and, based on this general survey, we can also see the general situation of the air force in various countries.</p>
<p>According to the "International Armaments Yearbook of 1935" compiled by the International League Supervision Bureau, the recent air force strength of major countries in the world is as follows:</p>
<p>Italy 1861 26.6 15.9</p>
<p>Soviet Union 1861 116.6 15.9</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia ×70 ×34.4 28.7</p>
<p>Netherlands ×446 ×11.6 0.7</p>
<p>Belgium 195 10.1 2.5</p>
<p>China 150 … 4.2</p>
<p>The above is roughly the air force strength of various countries. Of course, the numbers in this table are not necessarily the actual figures. At the same time, regarding the number and squadrons of military aircraft in various countries, the "Aviation Yearbook" issued by the Japan Imperial Aviation Association this year載着:</p>
<p>Number of Aircraft Squadrons</p>
<p>France 18000 (units) 165</p>
<p>UK 100090</p>
<p>US 100090</p>
<p>Soviet Union 1400130</p>
<p>Italy 1200110</p>
<p>Germany 90080</p>
<p>Poland 70059</p>
<p>Czechoslovakia 56051</p>
<p>Netherlands 40036</p>
<p>Romania 40036</p>
<p>Spain 15022</p>
<p>Turkey 20020</p>
<p>China 20018</p>
<p>Yugoslavia 60052</p>
<p>Because this is the record of the Japanese "Aviation Yearbook", it does not tell us about the air force situation of Japan. At the same time, the total number is not necessarily reliable. However, we can also see the general air force strength of various countries from this. In addition, the "Aviation Yearbook" published in the United States in 1935 made such a statistic on the development of the number of military aircraft in various countries in recent years:</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<p>January 1932 January 1914 January 1953</p>
<p>France 4000 (millions) 40003600</p>
<p>Soviet Union 150022003000</p>
<p>UK 200025002800</p>
<p>Italy 180023002300</p>
<p>US 180017002060</p>
<p>Japan 130015001850</p>
<p>Germany — 200600</p>
<p>From this, we can not only see the approximate number of military aircraft currently owned by various countries, but also see the development of the air force in various countries.</p>
<p>Although the numbers in the above three tables are different, we can also see a common trend, that is, the number of aircraft in France, the Soviet Union, the United Kingdom, and Italy is greater than in other countries.</p>
<p>Now, in order to further clarify the problem, let's briefly describe the air force situation of the major air force countries.</p>
<p>United States—The United States does not have an independent air force, and its air force is preserved as part of the army and navy (the aviation department). The hypothetical enemy of the United States in military affairs is Japan, so all its naval equipment and air force expansion are aimed at Japan.</p>
<p>United Kingdom—Because the United Kingdom suffered a painful attack by German aircraft in the last World War, the United Kingdom has worked hard to expand its air force after the war, making it a large air force country. Now, in addition to what we can see on the surface, the United Kingdom has a large potential force in its air force. For example, British merchant ships can be immediately transformed into fifty aircraft carriers in the event of a war, and its civilian aviation industry is also closely related to its air force equipment. If a war breaks out and London is attacked by the air force, the United Kingdom can mobilize at least one thousand aircraft to defend.</p>
<p>France! France has the largest number of military aircraft in the world. Now, in addition to the existing aircraft, France can also manufacture hundreds of new aircraft every year. There are currently twenty-five aircraft manufacturing plants in Paris, and the French government is working hard to urge them to rush to build aircraft. Therefore, once a war breaks out, how the air force of France is really cannot be estimated by us.</p>
<p>Germany! Germany's air force construction only began publicly after Hitler announced the rearmament. This spring, Goring publicly announced that Germany must have at least 40% of the total number of military aircraft in France, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. Accordingly, Germany will have 2,600 military aircraft within the next year. Germany is a heavy industry country, and its entire military expansion plan can be realized in a short period of time, so Germany's air force is also particularly worthy of attention.</p>
<p>Italy! From the surface, Italy's air force strength seems to be under France, the United Kingdom, and the United States, but its control technology is better than other countries, and its flight speed and altitude also maintain the world's highest record. Therefore, when the conflict between Britain and Italy becomes increasingly apparent, the British Empire pays close attention to Italy's air force.</p>
<p>Soviet Union—The development of the Soviet Union's air force in recent years has been very alarming. According to general surveys, the Soviet Union now has at least 3,000 military aircraft, almost equal to France. The extension of its civil aviation routes is also about 50,000 seeds. At the same time, it also organizes workers' flying clubs to vigorously cultivate driving talents. The Soviet Union is particularly noteworthy in scientific research, especially in future chemical warfare.</p>
<p>In addition, the air force strength of Japan, Poland, Czechoslovakia, etc. is also very small, but due to space limitations, it cannot be described in detail here. However, based on the above situation, we can also imagine the lively situation of future air warfare.</p>
<p>Feature Story</p>
<h3>Grand National Games Opening Ceremony</h3>
<p>— Kuai Ma</p>
<p>"Joyful events happen every year, but this year there are especially many." This saying perfectly describes this year's Double Tenth Festival; the tenth of October is National Day, and it happens to coincide with the opening ceremony of the biennial National Games, which is even more coincidentally being held at the newly built sports field in Shanghai City, which cost over a million dollars.</p>
<p>Normally, it's not easy for me to wake up early, but that day I had to make an exception and get up extra early to attend this grand occasion. When I left home, it wasn't even seven o'clock, but the double-decker buses along the way were already packed with people and kept driving past non-stop. After waiting at the station for more than twenty minutes, I finally managed to find a seat on the fifth bus that came along, and rode it all the way to the entrance of the Hongkou swimming pool.</p>
<p>The city center sports field is still more than ten miles away from here, but the lively atmosphere seems to be contagious and has already started here. People are surging like a tide, and strings of colorful cars are linked together, wriggling forward like crawling insects. The yellow buses coming from Baoshan Road encounter an insurmountable obstacle when they reach this place; the crowds scramble to get on the bus, but when they realize that the bus is packed like a bag of cotton, they dejectedly lean back, and the voices erupt in another uproar.</p>
<p>"It's unfair, why doesn't the bus stop?" A young lad cursed at the driver, who didn't seem to care whether people lived or died.</p>
<p>"With so many people, how can it stop?" A fashionable woman standing next to the young man said sympathetically to the driver.</p>
<p>"When another bus comes, we'll intercept it."</p>
<p>Different emotions are revealed on everyone's face with distinct outlines. After a while, a large number of trucks from the Ningbo and China Moving Companies arrived, finally solving the difficulties of the yellow buses!</p>
<p>The moving trucks temporarily set a price of one dime per person, and in less than half an hour, more than a dozen trucks were filled, and I became a sardine sandwiched in the middle, and was brought to the city center.</p>
<p>Once on the bus, the mood changes; the bus moves like a snail, but no one feels it's slow, and they even proudly treat the pedestrians on the road as the focus of their conversation.</p>
<p>"Walking such a long distance is exhausting!"</p>
<p>"Taking the bus costs money! Haha..."</p>
<p>After a while, the bus stopped on the Guosong Road to catch its breath, and people flew out like bees leaving their hive. On the several roads near the sports field, one could only see heads swaying everywhere. At the entrance to the venue, beneath a red high wall resembling an ancient castle, three exits shaped like bridge arches were opened, and the human tide was surging inward. Clusters of heads were piled up at several ticket windows, undulating in a wave-like motion, their expressions tense and anxious. Once they got their tickets, they smiled knowingly at each other, and each went their own way.</p>
<p>My advantage was that I didn't need to buy a ticket, so my attitude was more relaxed. Entering the venue, I was filled with a feeling of awe. I stood at the exit of the main platform for a moment, and when I looked around, the stands on all sides were almost full, and the red and green clothes formed various different patterns. Around eight o'clock, the Boy Scouts from various schools arrived, and a sloped yellow surface suddenly appeared next to the south stand. At the same time, the military music sounded from all sides, and the entire venue showed a joyous atmosphere of a "prosperous and peaceful age."</p>
<p>Chairman Lin was the most eye-catching figure in the venue. He arrived at the venue from the city government amidst a crowd of people. At this time, the high-ranking government officials and foreign guests were already sitting upright on the "West Command Platform." Upon hearing that Chairman Lin had arrived, they all stood up in unison to show their respect. Mayor Wu, wearing a long gown and mandarin jacket, quickly rushed to the entrance to greet the Chairman's "exalted presence." Chairman Lin held his hat in his hand, and his silvery white beard fluttered in front of his chest, and he nodded frequently to the foreign guests and government officials, like an old man who had had too much to drink.</p>
<p>Before the opening of the National Games, the National Day Commemoration Ceremony was held first. When shouting the slogan "Long Live the Republic of China," the foreign guests in the venue could not help but shout along after the great slogan.</p>
<p>After the National Day Commemoration Ceremony, it was the "appearance" of the President of the National Games—that is, the Minister of Education—Wang Shijie. Minister Wang was very short, with a dark face and wearing a pair of tortoiseshell-rimmed glasses, fully displaying the demeanor of a knowledgeable and capable scholar. At the call of Yu Hongjun, the Secretary-General of the City Government, the entire venue stood in unison, and moved in accordance with Minister Wang's actions.</p>
<p>Before long, the athletes from thirty-eight units marched in, all solemn and serious. The staff of the organizing committee all wore blue jackets and white trousers, and their attitude was very grand. The athletes from various places followed behind, showing the same spirit. The Shaanxi athletes were in the first team, and the last "rear guard" was the Shanghai team, the "host." The athletes from each team entered the venue from the "East Command Platform," walked around the field for a week, and when passing the "West Command Platform," their eyes mechanically looked up at the chairman and VIPs on the "Command Platform" in unison, and took off their hats to salute; Chairman Lin and the VIPs on the "Command Platform" also stood up and applauded frequently to welcome them. The athletes from each team walked to the "red stakes" in front of the "West Command Platform" and stood at attention; the organizing committee staff retreated to their designated locations. Then, the President of the Games, Wang Shijie, reported to the audience, mostly with words of encouragement. Then Mayor Lin, Chairman Lin, Kong Xiangxi, and Zhu Peide all gave speeches to the two thousand athletes, filled with the "spirit of Our Martial Virtue Shines."</p>
<p>The athlete's oath was usually led by one representative from the "Main Team"—that is, the Shanghai team—and this leader was the famous Wang Jihuai. When Mr. Wang "went up" to the oath platform, the representatives from each unit formed a semi-circular shape, holding their breath and waiting quietly. Mr. Wang calmly bowed to the "West Command Platform," and all the athletes stood up in unison. Then Mr. Wang raised his right hand and recited the oath loudly, one sentence and one action at a time, and the athletes below the stage also raised their right hands and recited it. Suddenly, the sound waves of the entire audience were flattened by the oath like a road.</p>
<p>Among the athletes from various units entering the venue, the most popular were the Northeast, Xinjiang, and Malaya teams. When the black and white flags of the Northeast athletes floated into the venue, the applause of countless crowds and VIPs on the command platform sounded like burning bamboo, revealing a tragic sympathy for the country's ruin and family destruction in the enthusiastic atmosphere. Then the Malayan athletes entered the venue, and there was another burst of enthusiastic applause, which lasted for several minutes before gradually stopping; this applause seemed to be showing people that "there are still people overseas"!</p>
<p>After the opening ceremony was completed, the Tai Chi exercise performance by three thousand elementary school students from this city followed. There were as many as thirty-six participating schools, and the costumes were all uniform white short tops and pants, and black cloth shoes. They were divided into sixty teams, each with one team leader; in front of them, there was a thirty-person military band leading the way, with flags fluttering, resembling a charging column on the battlefield. Mr. Chu Minyi served as the general commander, so the cry of "Chu Tai Chi" filled the entire venue that day; under the command of "Chu Tai Chi," they performed wonderful programs such as "Inside Thrust" and "Forearm Block." The applause of the audience resounded throughout the venue.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the track and field events began. The general public who couldn't get on the bus in the morning still flocked to the city center with such enthusiasm in the afternoon. However, just as people were in a joyful and encouraging mood, God suddenly acted strangely and sent down a torrential rain, turning the enthusiastic and tense atmosphere of the venue into a miserable and gloomy one; the peaceful exit became noisy again for a while. This noisy dynamic soon extended to the various roads near the sports field; waiting for the bus, scrambling, cursing, all kinds of sounds formed a cacophony, and the previous scene on Jiangwan Road was repeated. Finally, the moving trucks came again to solve this difficulty.</p>

<h3>Where Does Reason Come From?</h3>
<p>— Qian Kuangshi</p>
<p>Humans, as animals, are able to organize systems from a wide range of complex situations in their cognition, forming systematic thoughts. They can distinguish between right and wrong, truth and falsehood, and in their actions, they can decide what to do or not to do based on rational and irrational understanding, guiding their practice. Even in terms of emotions, they not only possess specially developed hatred and sympathy, but also can use reason to reconcile their emotions, allowing them to be properly expressed and displayed. All of these, taken together, are what we call reason. Reason is something that is particularly developed in humans, so humans are called rational animals. If a person does not speak of right and wrong or reason in their actions or words, but instead acts solely based on animalistic impulses, driven by their emotions, they will be cursed as a savage, an animal, a complete beast, which is to say that they are a person without reason. If this is the case, then reason seems to be closely tied to the essence of being human, and without reason, one is not qualified to be called a human. Of course, we cannot say that the origins of reason can only be found in humans. For example, judgment and sympathetic feelings, no matter how rudimentary they may be, definitely have their roots in animals, which cannot be denied. However, in any case, these things are more fully developed in humans, making it a subtle and essential part of human life, and it probably cannot be said that this statement is entirely wrong.</p>
<p>However, where does reason ultimately come from, and whether it is a permanently unchanging aspect of human nature, are points of contention in philosophy. Starting with the idealistic philosophers' handling of this issue, they have excessively absolutized and mystified the proposition that "man is a rational animal." They did not compare humans with other animals from an evolutionary perspective, and did not examine the differences in degree between them, thus determining early on that this thing was not the result of natural evolution. They neither relied on the progress of the material organization and structure of the organic body from animals to humans, gradually raising the spiritual fruits produced by the material basis that adapted to that progress, to understand that human reason developed to a particularly full extent, nor did they rely on the progress of human productive social life, gradually cultivating and changing human reason, making it develop toward higher realms, to explain reason. They simply believed that reason was a non-natural product, a human nature without natural roots. In their view, this human nature was derived from a world outside the material basis of the human body. It suddenly entered the human physical shell from an ideal spiritual realm, and humans thereby became rational animals, absolutely distinct from other animals. Plato's philosophy is like this. So he divides man into two parts, one part is the inferior material organism of the body, and the other part is the noble reason. This reason is not only generally regarded as something that exists independently of material bodies, and is regarded as the soul that controls the body, but is even thought to belong to the spiritual realm. Reason is absolutely good and unblemished, and man</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>Because of this, he belongs both to the inferior material and evil world, and also resides in the noble and good world of reason. To break free from sin, one must only recognize and develop one's reason. Not only Plato, but all idealists are like this, all treating reason as a non-natural product, a fixed and unchanging principle that pre-exists in the spiritual world. Humans are suddenly transformed because they alone are endowed with this thing. Even the great scientist Thomson also advocated this.</p>
<p>However, in our view, reason is certainly a very real thing, but it does not exist outside the natural world. All those who regard reason as something non-natural and not attached to matter are merely transforming the savage's clarified concept of the soul. Whether speaking of its thinking, judgment, or the exertion of its affective abilities, reason cannot be separated from the activities of these material organs of humans. Without perception, there is no way to arouse emotions and thoughts; without the ability to think, there is nothing called judgment, reasoning, and understanding, that is, there is no such thing as reason. However, perception relies on the sensory organs, and thought cannot but rely on the brain. Even perception and thought must rely on external phenomena and actions, so reason cannot be separated from matter. But the organs of human sensation and thought were gradually evolved from the animal organs of human ancestors. With this gradually progressive organ structure, there is a feeling and thinking ability that is particularly developed compared to animals, and reason is then revealed. So "nature" originally had no reason, but it can develop that unique activity or ability called wisdom, which is formed by the combination of various materials, and because of this, it can produce the entity of reason from its own womb, so reason is still a product of nature.</p>
<p>Not only that, but humans are not only a product of nature, they are also a product of society. Only the development of social productive labor can distinguish humans from the animal kingdom. Therefore, the progress of human material functions and their organs is the result of labor and production. The emergence of hands is a case in point, and the development of the brain is the same. Since human-like organs and their functions are created by productive labor, and human production and culture are social, the development of reason cannot but rely on social progress. The progress of society's material and spiritual culture gradually transforms the essence of man, and human reason gradually develops and changes on this basis. Civilized people can compete to talk about reason, but savages do not know what reason is, and this is the reason.</p>
<p>Because of this, we cannot say that reason is permanently unchanging. It has different rational contents and views according to the different social lives of each era, and according to the different classes of social differentiation. Deception is usually conscience-stricken, and it will be judged by our conscience or reason. However, when we are fighting and deceiving the enemy, it is not only permitted by reason, but also required by it. At this time, the right and wrong that our reason recognizes and judges, and the actions it guides, although completely contrary to all the actions of the reason of our opposing group, cannot remove us from being rational. All the organizations, structures, and social relations of feudal society are in accordance with human reason in the eyes of emperors and nobles, but people in civil society say that it is barbaric and brutal, and that only the various systems and lifestyles of civil society are in accordance with reason, which is clear evidence. From this, it can be seen that reason is not fixed and unchanging. It depends on the state of human life, depends on the era and stage of social evolution, that is, it depends on the changes in different environments and has different reasons that change at any time, which is very clear. Very rudimentary sprouts of reason began to appear from animals, and human reason emerged with natural evolution. And human reason is constantly changing with social evolution, and even now and in the future will not stop its evolution. If we regard society as a part of nature, then reason is produced by nature, and it is constantly changing with the evolution of nature. Reason is not mysterious in its origin and change. It is only the result of the overall evolution of the material world, and reason cannot be separated from nature and matter itself.</p>

<h3>Auspicious Seal Opening</h3>
<p>— Hong Jun</p>
<p>My friend obtained the "XX Province Stamp Tax on Tobacco and Alcohol, XXX Branch Office Director" job, and after receiving the letter of appointment, he told me to go and take over first. However, after staying in the hotel for more than ten days and negotiating with the previous director several times, I still couldn't get a definite "takeover" date! The previous director, Feng, was too slippery. When I first asked him when he would hand over, his reply was: "Wait for your director to arrive in person"; soon the director arrived, and he said again, "Wait for the order from the provincial office." This guy was really intentionally playing tricks by making excuses. However, our director was not easy to mess with either. He said calmly and confidently: "Brother, don't worry, I have a way. You come with me."</p>
<p>We met the previous director in the reception room of the Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau. He still said many reasons in a very round-about way why he couldn't hand over immediately, and even implied in his tone that we didn't understand the procedures. As a result, our director's face changed a little, and he said in a forceful tone: "Director Feng, you are underestimating me. If you really intend to make things difficult, then I will have to send a telegram to the provincial office saying that you are resisting the handover."</p>
<p>That guy was a bit taken aback, and his face, blackened by tobacco tar, turned a little red. He bit his lip and thought for a long time, then pretended to smile and said: "Why bother? The new and former directors are all family! It's not that I intentionally delayed, it's just that, it's just that..." He hesitated, unable to say the second half of the sentence, so he changed his tone, "Director Li, you are certainly on official business, and you must be very clear about the situation of the tax collection agencies..."</p>
<p>"I wouldn't dare say that, but...as long as you are frank, brother, I won't speak officialese..."</p>
<p>The two sides compared their strengths and realized that they were both insiders, so they tacitly agreed to set the first of the next month as the "takeover" date.</p>
<p>On the way, I couldn't figure out why he insisted on handing over only on the first of the next month. The director explained to me, "Brother, you are too quick to get angry. This is a secret of the officialdom: Director Feng is ostensibly collecting taxes according to regulations, but in reality, he is contracting it out to distilleries, which is a way to make money on both sides. However, the taxes can only be collected in full at the end of the month. If he hands over in the middle of the month, then the merchants will deny the taxes for that month. But it doesn't matter, it doesn't hinder us in any way."</p>
<p>The date of our takeover was quickly found out by the local newspaper reporters, and the next day it was disclosed in the × newspaper: "Feng ××, Director of the Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Inspection Branch Bureau of ××× three counties, has been transferred to the provincial office for another assignment. He will officially hand over on March 1st. The new director, Li ××, will take over on schedule and is currently residing at the ×× Hotel in this city." After this news was announced, "our temporary official office" suddenly became the center of politics, and many people came to the door. Managers of distilleries, representatives of tobacco merchants, local dignitaries, gentlemen, chairmen of wine industry associations, presidents of chambers of commerce, in short, from officials of government agencies to heads of occupational groups, all came to "pay their respects" one after another. They left today and came again tomorrow. The servants kept sending in "name cards," and we kept welcoming and sending them off, really overwhelmed with the reception and unable to cope. Such a small tobacco and alcohol bureau director actually had such prestige, no wonder people all want to become officials.</p>
<p>However, their visits were not due to admiration for the director's prestige, but for other purposes: roughly speaking, nothing more than 1. Contracting tax collection, 2. Introducing staff. Both are difficult problems, making it difficult to make a decisive decision. Although the former is related to tax policy, we can still use official jargon: "This is the charter of the Ministry of Finance, brother dare not violate the regulations and make friends," but the latter has no appropriate reason to resist, because when you become a director, you have a limit on the use of people. So when people pestered us too much, we could only say in a very round-about way: "Very good, let's register your name for now, but I haven't got my position yet."</p>
<p>That being said, there are still hundreds of names on the registration book. How can a small tobacco and alcohol bureau accommodate them? As a result, we can only deliberate on the situation of the introducer to determine the selection, so-called talent and ability. Here, it is fundamentally ineffective—however, after several considerations and several eliminations, there are still more than fifty people "waiting to be listed", among these fifty people, either the garrison introduced them, or the county magistrate strongly guaranteed them, and the lowest-ranking person was also the chief of the public security bureau as a guarantor (there are three county magistrates in the three counties, and there are also three chiefs of the public security bureau, and there are also awe-inspiring garrisons). In short, their background is very large, and a director of the Yin-alcohol bureau is not arrogant (it must be known that tax collection organs have armed forces, and they are also "gold and silver treasuries" coveted by everyone. If you don't make friends with the local government, military and police agencies, there are some constraints in handling affairs), but, on the one hand, for the sake of their own interests, they are unwilling to fully employ them,……This is really called "it's easy to be an official, but it's difficult to deal with it", even the director who is experienced in the world and has been in office for a long time is a bit embarrassed! As a result, we had to reduce salaries, barely place them, and wait until we are familiar with the situation after taking over, and then deliberate on the object, and implement the method of reduction!</p>
<p>However, on the first day of taking over, the former director sent another list of staff, which is the rule in the officialdom, that is, the transfer of staff, and the successor should employ a few for the convenience of receiving and understanding the situation. However, we originally brought more than a dozen people, plus more than fifty people introduced by powerful people, and we were struggling to find a place for them, so how could we receive the former director's transfer? So we could only be noncommittal and planned to muddle through. However, at night, most of the former director's staff (about twenty people) came to the director's "office" one after another to "pay their respects", or called it "congratulations", but the final topic was to focus on "hope to be employed". Some expressed their loyalty, some claimed to have experience in taxation, and some even imitated Zhang Song's presentation of a map, boxing out the lists of distilleries in the three counties, the recognized amount of monthly taxes, and the secrets of the former director were clearly presented to the director, some heard that I was a good friend of the director and that the position was important, so they took my path and asked me to speak for them. In short, these people are like begging dogs, and they are very good at seizing the opportunity to ask for food. At the same time, although they have the same purpose—wanting to get a position, they secretly expose each other's privacy when they see that the number of people is excessive (for example, after the first one says goodbye, the second one comes to say bad things about him), and always wants to defeat others to complete their own wishes. However, no matter how they justify themselves, we always give him a reply of "no position". Some people see that there is no hope beforehand, and ask for only the name of a "tax collector", without salary. At that time, I really didn't understand what this meant, but when I thought of the heavy inside story of the tax collection agency, I understood!</p>
<p>This night was particularly hard. On the one hand, we had to go through the formalities for taking over tomorrow (such as drafting announcements and official documents), and on the other hand, we had to deal with the entanglement of so many people who were seeking for positions. We said many things that we didn't want to say and put on many different faces. This was commonplace for the director, but it was a bitter thing for me!</p>
<p>The next day was March 1st. The former director sent two seals of tobacco and alcohol tax and tobacco and alcohol license tax in red gift envelopes. Although there was no grand seal handover ceremony, the director also took the seal in his hand very solemnly. Then he immediately posted announcements and sent official letters, expressing his promotion to the position.</p>
<p>This day, the "New Tobacco and Alcohol Bureau" (as the locals called it) was particularly lively. In addition to others coming to contact and visit, dozens of "future employees" also came to inquire about news and wait for the letter of appointment. Because the director was busy visiting various agencies, all the social engagements in the bureau fell on my head. This honor is more bitter than anything else. Some people can pester you for one or two hours to ask for something. If you want to send guests away, you feel that you can't save face. You might as well hold down a vexed heart and deal with him yes or no! It's hard to kill the light of the day, and I can already feel very tired and bored, but the trouble is all behind me, and I won't go into details here.</p>

<h3>An Anatomy of the National Socialist Party</h3>
<p>— By Shi</p>
<p>Berlin Correspondence</p>
<p>Since the Great War, Germany has remained one of Europe’s most industrialized nations, and its social structure has become increasingly complex. The accelerating mechanization and rationalization of production have reduced the need for laborers while nearly doubling the number of salaried workers—the so-called "white-collar workers." The global economic panic caused many laborers to become unemployed, leading them to join the Social Democratic Party or the Communist Party. As for the salaried workers, they were also greatly affected by the economic downturn, and most of them joined Hitler's National Socialist Party.</p>
<p>The salaries of "white-collar workers" were low and offered little hope of increase. According to statistics, the average monthly salary for male salaried workers was 63 gold marks, but half of them earned no more than 19.5 marks. The monthly salary for female salaried workers was slightly less than 37.5 marks, but most of them earned only slightly more than 35.5 marks. This is why female white-collar workers constitute more than half of the National Socialist Party's supporters. Furthermore, there was a significant disparity in salaries between older and younger workers: young shop assistants earned only half or even a third of what older shop assistants earned; and by the time they reached 45, these older workers were replaced by younger ones.</p>
<p>Out of the 3.5 million white-collar workers—one-third of whom were women—3 million were forced to live like proletarians. However, they refused to join the working class, so they also opposed social struggles, seeing them as a threat to their future. The majority of the white-collar class consisted of retired officers, military widows, retired shop owners, and so on, who were unwilling to acknowledge that they shared common interests with the proletariat. Hitler's book "Mein Kampf" expresses this attitude. He himself dropped out of middle school to become a worker due to family financial difficulties, and for a time, he was involved in the radical labor movement, but later he broke away from it.</p>
<p>The middle class that supports the National Socialist Party includes small-capital small industrialists and merchants, those unorganized small business owners who have lost their independent economic status in the era of large-capital monopolies and suffer from reduced profits, diminished capital, and restricted credit. These small business owners all oppose large capitalists’ enterprises, but because large capitalists are also the enemy of ordinary laborers, from this standpoint, capitalists are not the enemy of the small business class. The National Socialist Party's fervent anti-Semitic sentiment is welcomed by the bourgeoisie, because the total of 500,000 Jewish people, acting as legal experts, lawyers, bankers, merchants, and traders, are formidable competitors to the German bourgeoisie. From this perspective, the National Socialist Party and the German</p>

<p>bourgeoisie share common interests.</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party also reflects the grievances and ambitions of farmers burdened by $3 billion in debt. Small farmers generally harbor resentment towards urban dwellers, and Marxism clashes with their concept of private property. Therefore, they would rather align themselves with the white-collar movement than join the ranks of laborers.</p>
<p>Combative Hitlerism is carried out by stormtroopers, who implement the most radical movements. This party's fighting organization—the stormtroopers—not only protects and promotes the party's interests but also plays the role formerly held by the national army. The members are mostly young people born between 1904 and 1912; these proponents of violence are mostly young people from universities and the middle class. (Today, the output of university students in Germany has increased by 60% compared to 1914, exceeding the number that German industry can absorb. In recent years, 30,000 graduates have not found employment, and in another year or two, this number may reach 130,000.)</p>
<p>One noteworthy fact is that the majority of German laborers have joined left-wing parties and are unwilling to join the National Socialist Party; their aversion to the National Socialist Party's bourgeois nature is particularly profound. We can easily understand this fact by studying the voting statistics of Berlin and other major cities. However, the National Socialist Party ignores this and still hopes to spread its ideology to the working class.</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party sings songs of change and the "Internationale." Their stormtroopers are primarily composed of middle-class individuals, and now they want to recruit laborers. However, in supporting laborers' resistance, Hitlerism becomes ambiguous, sometimes supporting and sometimes opposing strikes, making it difficult to grasp its true stance. For example, in the winter of 1932, the National Socialist Party and the Communist Party jointly carried out a tramway strike. Also, during the 1931 Berlin metalworkers' strike, a spokesperson for the Hitler Party declared that it was nearly impossible to prohibit party members from participating in the strike. However, after the National Socialist Party came to power, it resolutely implemented a one-party dictatorship and repeatedly tried to seize the labor unions that were Marxist strongholds, but often failed.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the National Socialist Party's propaganda to laborers is not entirely ineffective. One-tenth to one-fifth of the party's members come from the working class, some of whom have joined the National Socialist Party in the hope of finding employment.</p>
<p>The National Socialist Party often fulfills its promise of securing employment for its members, because they have considerable connections with capitalists and employers. It would not be an exaggeration to call this a spectacle. The full name of the National Socialist Party is the National Socialist German Workers' Party, but in reality, its main supporters are the industrial giants that the party claims to attack. (Note: The party advocates for the socialization of all production.) It is rumored that Hugenberg, one of Germany's wealthiest men, has provided substantial financial support in the past. Some say that the reason why Hitlerism has spread so rapidly is that he can use money and power when necessary.</p>
<p>The reason why German capitalism has chosen fascism is that it sees it as less harmful to capitalism than communism. As the economic downturn in Germany deepens, industrialists and privileged classes are increasingly unable to find a way out, and thus Hitler has become their chosen one.</p>

<h3>Overseas Chinese Around the World (XIV)</h3>
<p>— By Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>At the same time, the overseas Chinese in the West Indies also have a strong sense of homeland and patriotism. The money they save is continuously remitted back to their hometowns. Although they also intermarry with the local Black people, they still have not forgotten that they are Chinese. Even the mixed-race children born from their marriages with Black people resemble Chinese and their thinking is still Chinese. However, precisely because of this, the local Black people have recently become increasingly resentful of the overseas Chinese, and sometimes even organize themselves to vandalize shops opened by overseas Chinese. Under these circumstances, our compatriots in the West Indies, because they do not receive assistance from a strong and powerful motherland, have no choice but to swallow their anger and quietly return to their hometowns.</p>
<p>6. Overseas Chinese in Africa</p>
<p>Africa is far from China and has historically had no close relationship. Although the Ming dynasty eunuch Zheng He visited the east coast of Africa during his voyages to the South Seas, China and Africa did not develop any relationship as a result. Between 1904 and 1910, the discovery of gold mines in Transvaal, British South Africa, led to the recruitment of many Chinese contract laborers, and thus Africa, with which we had no previous connection, saw the footprints of many Chinese. According to surveys, the peak period for overseas Chinese in the region was in 1907, with a total of 55,000 people. However, after the abolition of the contract system, these Chinese laborers left accordingly, and recently, there were only 2,174 people left in the area. Most of them make a living by opening grocery stores, restaurants, or laundromats, and some also engage in horticulture.</p>
<p>British South Africa imposes extremely strict restrictions on overseas Chinese. In 1903, the authorities issued "overseas Chinese licenses" in an attempt to restrict the entry of overseas Chinese. In 1908, they further published the "Mining Law," which prohibited people of color from residing within mining areas. In addition, Chinese people were also subject to restrictions on transportation and entertainment. Therefore, it is very difficult for overseas Chinese to seek development in South Africa.</p>
<p>In addition to British South Africa, there are also one to two thousand overseas Chinese each in French Madagascar and Réunion; and there are also more than three thousand overseas Chinese in Mauritius. However, they do not occupy an important position in any of these places, so they are not given much attention.</p>
<p>Australia</p>
<p>7. Overseas Chinese in Australia, Honolulu, and other places</p>
<p>Australia is one of the five major dominions of the British Empire. The land was originally inhabited by wild silk moth ethnic groups who lived a nomadic hunting lifestyle, and few residents were able to engage in agriculture and animal husbandry. China's relationship with the region dates back to the 13th century, which is actually much earlier than the discovery of Australia by white people. However, the formal migration of overseas Chinese to Australia occurred after the discovery of Australia by white people. Because Australia has vast lands and abundant natural resources, white people worked hard to develop it after arriving, requiring a lot of labor. Since Europe was relatively far away, Easterners and Chinese people took the opportunity to flock to Australia. After gold mines were discovered in Victoria in 1853, even more overseas Chinese went there. In 1859, there were 52,000 overseas Chinese in Victoria, most of whom lived in the surrounding gold mining areas. In addition, there were 13,000 Chinese laborers in New South Wales. However, as the number of overseas Chinese increased, Australia implemented the "White Australia policy," desperately restricting the immigration of colored people, especially Chinese. First, the Victorian State Parliament passed regulations restricting the entry of overseas Chinese, and then other states followed suit, imposing various restrictions on overseas Chinese. Therefore, in the past thirty years, the number of overseas Chinese in Australia has not only not increased, but has decreased by 17,000 to 18,000 people.</p>
<p>Honolulu</p>
<p>Honolulu is now the American territory of Hawaii; because the area originally produced sandalwood, overseas Chinese named it Sandalwood Mountain. This place has always been a meeting place for all ethnic groups, and there were already Chinese people there during the rule of the native chieftains, so the culture here has long been influenced by China. In 1880, there were 20,000 overseas Chinese on the island of Hawaii, many of whom were growing sugarcane. However, the islanders were very hostile to the overseas Chinese and excluded them in various ways. After the island issued a new law restricting the entry of Chinese laborers in 1883, it was naturally even more difficult for overseas Chinese to come here.</p>
<p>After the United States annexed Honolulu in 1898, it further restricted the entry of Chinese people. After the United States annexed the Philippine Islands, it reiterated the ban, and the restrictions on overseas Chinese were even more extensive than before. On April 20, 1902, the United States passed a bill stating: "All American immigration prohibition regulations shall apply uniformly to all American territories. Chinese laborers in American territories, regardless of whether they came before the cession, shall not be allowed to go to any part of the American mainland or to travel to other islands unless they have acquired American citizenship. ..."

<p>Will the Chen Diao case really be reconciled, and will their feelings really return to their original state? Let's see what happens next.</p>
<p>"Metropolitan Scenery" is worthy of being a good play. At least the word "new type" is enough. However, the good thing is the dubbing is cartoonish, so the impact it gives is new, interesting and likable.</p>
<p>In "Metropolitan Scenery," Li Mu's eyes open and close, giving the impression that he is the only one who is sober while everyone else is drunk, transcending worldly affairs.</p>
<p>In "Metropolitan Scenery," the two new actors, Donald, who goes from theory to practice, is competent, but Lily Zhang is not exciting, and her voice is harsh and unpleasant. Is this the unique vision of an "old customer"?</p>
<h3>"Metropolitan Scenery" Sells Out</h3>
<p>"Metropolitan Scenery", which satirizes the current social situation and human relationships and depicts the extravagant life of the city, has been showing at the Jin Cheng Grand Theater for days, and viewers are like clouds, expressing their admiration and praise for the play's appearance in the national film in a different posture. The words and actions of the characters in the play are accompanied by meaningful music, and the humor is sudden and unexpected, which is unprecedented. The novelty of the plot and the interesting scenes are even more unprecedented. The expressions of the leading actors Zhang Xinzhu, Donald, Zhou Bodong, etc. can all conform to the personality of the characters in the play, giving full play to the colorfulness. The film is a huge production made with all its might by the Diantong Company, with about 200 collaborators. Movie fans should watch it early.</p>
