<h3>奧國重整軍備與歐洲局勢</h3>
<p>— 冷觀</p>
<p>日前維也納電稱。奧國政府發表文告。擬卽恢復徵兵制。着手準備增加陸軍為六萬五千人。並擬派專使。參加本月十一日之斯特萊薩會議。（英法意三國會議。）請求列强允許。匈保二國亦擬援例要求。其進行步驟。雖與德國逕自廢約者不同。其不願受聖哲曼和約之束縛。固屬顯而易見。聖哲曼和約。係歐洲大戰後各國對奧之約。一九一九年九月十日在巴黎東南境聖哲曼盎雷依宮中簽訂者。按該約第四節規定。限制奧國軍備甚嚴。如陸軍總額不得超過三萬人。徵兵制永遠廢除是也。恰與凡爾賽和約限制德國軍備用意相同。德國業已重整軍備。自四月一日起正式成立空軍。希特拉並自承其本國空軍實力。堪與英國並駕齊驅。蓋在期前秘密布置。按照預定計畫進行不懈。迨至準備就緒。始公然宣布耳。今奧國亦宣吿重整軍備。以德國行動為藉口。德旣自由解除凡爾賽和約之束縛。奧可不必再受聖哲曼和約之箝制。在彼二國當局自辯。謂今日列强行動。以充實武力為第一義。不能獨責德奧之守約。未嘗不振振有詞也。</p>
<p>由是。最近各方對於歐洲平和前途之揣測。衆說紛紜。莫衷一是。大別之則。分悲觀與樂觀兩派。持悲觀說者謂德奧相繼重整軍備。為世界第二次大戰前夕之徵兆。蓋自九一八事件起後。國際聯盟不能制裁日本。盟約徒為具文。今則德奧撕破巴黎和約。列强又莫可如何。此後國際紛爭。除訴諸武力外。絕無解决之道。固有條約將成廢紙。乃又有所謂中歐公約東歐公約。方在磋議進行之中。違約背信者旣可肆無忌憚。縱再締結新約。亦屬徒勞無補。蓋帝國主義內部的矛盾。永久存在。卽血肉相搏之機不能避免。列强互相睥睨。劍拔弩張。第二次大戰勃發。殆相去不遠矣。然持樂觀說者則曰。是有未盡然者。當一九一四年八月戰釁初開之際。德意志恃其甲兵之精。又挾同盟以自重所。以寗為戎首。今則時異勢殊。德已陷於孤立地位。雖違背誓約。重整軍備。而欲在歐洲捲士重來。恐亦不可復得。况其舊盟之奧國。日夕惴惴。惟恐為德兼併。此次宣吿恢復徵兵制。名為援例要求。實卽對德嚴加戒備在外交方面已得法蘭西諒解。故奧國當局有恃無恐。毅然出此也。本年一月七日。意相墨索利尼與法外長賴佛爾簽訂羅馬協定。二月三日。賴佛爾又與英外長西門發表倫敦宣言。此輩盡其折衝之力。擬保障歐洲安全。亦無非為避免戰禍而已。蘇聯與法相親。法又與英意相結。其共同對德之意。灼然可見。德國軍備卽使悉復舊觀。亦安敢輕舉啟釁。再蹈覆轍乎。至英國當局態度。對於凡爾賽和約中軍事條欵。本主修正。說者謂為袒德。亦未盡然。德國處心積慮。不甘受凡爾賽和約之束縛。匪特英人早窺其隱。卽在他國當局諒亦知之有素。蓋其整飭軍備。久在裏面進行。至近時始公然發表。他國旣無法加以制止。縱留限制空文。亦屬徒勞無補。所以在倫敦宣言中。有修改軍事條欵之提議。英國要人艾登輩奔走於莫斯科華沙柏林之間。風塵僕僕。竭力斡旋。無非為保持歐洲均勢局面起見。且據近日倫敦電稱。艾登莫斯科之行。雙方談話頗見接近。現下院要求政府說明對蘇交涉情形並不迫切。多數黨已有好感。可推而知。據此。則英國態度。頗欲與蘇聯增進友誼。旣不反蘇。亦非袒德。其與法國對德熊度不同者。不過較為和緩耳。要之。歐洲大國如英蘇法意。雖於整軍經武。竭力進行。一面仍斡旋和平。期免戰禍。奧國　解除聖哲曼和約之束縛。請求列强允許。究與德國逕自廢約者不同。將來歐洲局勢。是否不至破裂。雖未敢懸斷要在最近期間。未必有戰禍勃發耳。</p>
<p>以上二說。均能言之成理。持之有數。吾人姑不必强為軒輊。蓋就目前各方奔走和平之情形觀之。樂觀論頗為有力。就各國軍擴之狂熱。以及國際情勢日趨緊張之事實而論。則悲觀說殊有堅强之理由。然有不能不指出者兩點。其一。歐洲局勢之不穩與不安。事實顯然。無論誰何不能否認。其二。歐洲局勢是否不至破裂。亦無論誰何不敢擔保。兩點旣明。國人更當想到歐西多事。並非中國之福。第一次世界大戰時吾國所受東方之腰迫。若猶在國人記憶之中則在第二次世界大戰未臨之時國人不當知所警惕亟為未雨之謀耶。</p>

<h3>綏精歐洲局勢　英謀另闢新蹊徑　擬放棄東歐保安公約　三國意見南轅而北轍　斯特裏薩會議週四開幕　决定由首相偕外相參加</h3>
<p>（倫敦）今夜得悉、內閣有放棄東歐保安公約而另闢蹊徑、謀成協定之傾向、所謂「新路綫」、明日閣議時當可形成、政府方面現認東歐公約載有軍事援助條欵、今已為德波之反對蘇俄參加而流產、英國鑒於此種局勢、現亦漸次主張於西歐公約外、不願參加任何互助恊定、如法俄置德國於不顧、逕自締結此項東歐公約、則英國祇有袖手旁觀、據巴黎電、英國此種態度已使法京人士愈增憤懣、蓋法當局以為英法意之意見南轅北轍、頗足危害斯特里薩會議也、更據此間消息、英國固願見不侵犯條約推及歐陸、惟不願自身牽入戰爭漩渦、而法俄捷之三國軍事同盟或將急轉直下、此三國並希望愛沙尼亞、拉特維亞·及立陶宛三小國一致行動、德國則正在養精蓄銳、靜觀變局之推移、自信實力充足後、不患無與國也、（七日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）首相麥唐納今晚在下院宣布、渠將與外相西門參加斯特里薩會議云、按該會議定四月十一日開幕、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>閣議聆取報告</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晨內閣開特別會議、討論外相西門掌璽大臣艾登所提出此次赴歐陸數國都城與當局談話之詳細紀錄、並個人印象之報吿、歷兩小時之久、繼又决定出席斯特里薩會議之人物、西門將於今日在下院作簡短之陳述明日擬續作較長之一般陳述、</p>
<p>艾登抱恙缺席</p>
<p>艾登今日因旅途中勞頓過甚、未能參加閣議、據其醫務顧問今日發表之公報稱、艾登君因近今在天空旅行中勞頓過甚、致心神不寗、其體况不足為慮、惟必須靜養四星期至六星期之久云、英國朝野聞艾登不豫消息、皆為戚戚、首相麥唐納曾往慰問、繼稱、渠因公私上之原因、聞艾登政躬不豫、不勝憂戚云、現各處紛紛來電祝艾登早日復原、其中多此次出行新結識之友朋、西門與外交次官樊西泰星期六日曾同往訪艾登、星期日首相亦往訪之、互談此次聘問各國之結果、艾登自去年任掌璽大臣至今、在空陸海旅行數千哩、計蒞日內瓦五次、曾為軍縮問題至巴黎羅馬柏林、又曾報聘丹麥挪威瑞典三國、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）英國掌璽大臣艾登歷遊德俄波捷四國、返英之後、偶占小極、今日不能出席內閣會議、並將不赴斯特里薩會議、巴黎廻聲報得此消息、頗為遺憾、該報並悉英國政府將由首相麥唐納代表出席斯特里薩會議、據倫敦每日電聞報載稱、此事業已確定、今日英國閣議中、卽將予以决定云云、因此巴黎廻聲報謂、英相旣躬自參加、則總理佛蘭亭亦應前往出席、蓋英法意三國政府當局在斯特里薩會議當面會商一切、實屬必要云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法共表人選　取决今日閣議</h3>
<p>（巴黎）英法意三國斯德萊薩會議、舉行在卽、關於法國方面代表人選、據負責方面宣稱、除外長賴伐爾决將親自出席、佛蘭亭總理或亦前往、惟須俟明日閣議、方能採取最後决定云、（八日哈瓦斯電）一時報」評論歐洲時局、謂「現有一三種可能步驟、一則與德國合作、二則共同聯合以防備德國、三則陣線凌亂、責任不明、以上三者必須明白選擇其一、該報以為斯德萊柴會議、當作最後之解决、但若訂結各種公約、以期敷衍門面、則勢必陷入於魔術圈、反至造成惡劣空氣、而無法獲得實際之解决、其危險莫此為甚、現所企圖之方策、亦甚多矣、一派主張訂立雙方公約、以反對區域公約、一派主張有保障及制裁辦法之一般公約、以反對無制裁之公約、然無論如何、採取中下之解决方策、較諸坐令混沌不安之空氣、繼續延長、猶為愈也」云云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英國外交策　預料不出兩途</h3>
<p>（倫敦）各報對於今日內閣會議、均極重視、以為其所决議、對於英國外交政策極有關係、各報以掌璽大臣艾登不能出席閣議報告聘訪德俄波捷之情形、深爲扼腕、晨郵報謂、「目前所應解決之問題、卽英國是否應繼續爲歐陸列強間之調解人、抑將切實決定加入反對修改和約派之一方面、」該報以為與德國覔獲妥協、未嘗不可能、惟欲成立最後協調、非歷多年不爲功、如在目前、無更佳之保障、使國社黨不復有鹵莽滅裂之舉、則列强藉武力以反抗德國、類此之行動、自屬必然之理云、「每日電聞報」之論調與此相同、謂英國外交政策不出二途、一則維持目前旣非光榮亦難持久之孤立狀態、一則在國聯會統率下、毅力協助集體行動是也、英國對此二途、何所適從、實係歐洲未來和平之關鍵、英國閣員大多數均贊成集體行動之原則、蓋惟集體行動、方足以在現在及將來、阻止戰爭之爆發也、「泰晤士報」則謂、英國固不願從事戰爭、然對於從事戰爭者、英國應有所表示、堅决加以反對、則亦不容置疑、不寗唯是、英國更必須設法消弭目前國際間不安之局勢、以使戰爭之潛伏根源、完全消失而後可、該報又謂、目前並無何種侵略主義之危險、英國外交努力目標、要在使德國加入集體和平制度及國聯會而已、「每日民聲報」則謂、英法意三國公約·東歐公約·西歐公約·三者如缺其一、則和平之感覺、卽無由產生、如欲確保歐洲之和平、則必先增加日內瓦之實力、然後應卽開始討論修改和約云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>法外將繼艾登　聘問俄波兩京　定本月二十三日啟程　討論德整軍所引起之局勢</h3>
<p>（巴黎）據今日此間消息、法外長賴伐爾應波蘭之請、將游華沙、但先赴莫斯科、此行旨趣、在討論緩和因德國决定重整軍備而起的嚴重時局之方法、賴氏將於四月二十三日由巴黎赴莫斯科、大約將在俄京小住三日、然後往華沙、（八日路透電）</p>
<h3>意大利　願與南國携手　反對強力修改和約</h3>
<p>南斯拉夫京城　意大利新任公使剛巴爾多、頃向眞理報發表談話、謂「意相墨索里尼對於南斯拉夫懷最良好之意向、願與南國成立持久之妥協、兩國間若有爭執問題、自當予以了結、卽如兩國曾經訂立若干種協定、但因種種原因迄未實行、此層解决後、再當訂立新商約、並準備一種友好條約、或將現行友好修約予以延長、」剛氏嗣又說明南國故君亞歷山大一世及法國故外長巴爾都、原亦贊成意南兩國互相提携、並謂「意大利認小協商集團係屬國際上良好組織、富有生存能力及政治觀念、至於修改和約問題、則國聯盟約第十九條業已載明國際條約有修正之可能、惟須出以合法手續、此在意國固亦始終反對以强力修改也」云云、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>巴黎人士募捐　爲南故王建紀念碑</h3>
<p>（巴黎）本日此問舉行公開募捐、以為南斯拉夫前王亞歷山大一世建立紀念碑、政府特准許以本日為全國募捐日、外長賴伐爾並於昨晚發來無綫電演說、請法國全國人民踴躍輸將、從今晨起、巴黎各街道卽有男女隊員、臂纏三色國徽、分向路人請求解囊相助、凡捐欵者、一律授以徽章、佩於胸際、以誌識別、徽章係繪一南王亞歷山大之頭像、四圍繞以花圈、其上則繪一南斯拉夫國旗、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>步武德國後塵　奧匈保將要求擴軍　英意有贊助傾向　奧復辟暫觀實現</h3>
<p>（羅馬）半官性質之意大利民報、今日隱示意政府願贊助奧匈保擴張陸軍之任何行動、該報討論三國之軍備程度、謂强國如德、任令以片面行動重整軍備、弱國則不許其有此權、此實違反國際平等任何原則之罪惡、意國對於此事之態度、將在斯特里薩會議中聲明之云、（七日路透社電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）半官式之「意大利人民報」登載論文、對於奧大利匃牙利保加利亞各國增加軍備事、有所論列、略謂「單方面决定廢止和約軍事條欵、何若根據公理、慷慨加以承認之為愈、蓋和約應由和平之責者提出修正、作為一種和解之行動、庶幾一方面不至公然破壞和約、而另一方面亦可不至提出暴烈之抗議、且和約中之軍事條欵、倘以友好之精神加以修正、則從此戰勝國與戰敗國之差別、可以完全消滅、而奧匃保三國與小協國之關係、亦必因以改善矣」云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（維也納）奧國今日殊為興奮、公衆目光又復集中於哈布斯堡皇室復辟之可能性、官方仍否認奧國向列强請求准許增加陸軍一倍之目的、係在準備使沃都大公登極、然在羅馬尼亞及南斯拉夫邊境已謠言蠭起、並已宣布謂小協約國將竭力反對修改聖日耳曼條約、根據該約規定、目前奧國陸軍祇准有三萬人、皆為長期服役之志願軍人、奧國已宣布將遣派代表列席斯特菜薩會議、要求增加軍額一倍、並得施行徵兵制度、意大利已表示贊成該項計劃、英國則表示奧國倘能遵守聖日耳曼條約、亦為同意、保加利亞及匈牙利兩國亦請求增加軍力、謂四週國家皆已軍備强盛、彼等軍力微薄、殊覺不能自衛、至於奧國總理許士尼格及外長華登納格則皆為帝制派人物、惟彼等因他國反對、且不願拂逆英法、故尚未設法使沃都大公登位、奧總理曾謂、國社黨苟不計劃奪取政權、彼亦不出於復辟一途、現在沃都大公仍與其母安居比京郊外、據稱經濟問題實為目前復辟運動之最大障碍、奧國殊無力供養君王、因為沃都卽位、卽有赤貧之大公及大公夫人二百餘人隨之返國、此輩皆須國家供養、其費用當足驚人、大戰後、奧國實為歐洲之乞丐國家、其生活資源咸受條約所宰割、故其所受和約之痛苦、殊較他國為甚、是故英意兩國深覺奧國應略有報酬、據觀察者之意見、無論斯特萊薩會議能否准許奧國重整軍備、沃都大公暫時尚無復辟之望、因哈布斯堡皇室復位、如未得小協約國同意、恐不崇朝而戰爭隨起也、至於小協約國之所以反對、實有種種關係、蓋復辟之後、奧國將易於統一强盛、因此小協約國之天主敎人民亦將謀在各該國內擁立哈布斯堡皇室之君主、且捷克之斯拉夫民族、南斯拉夫之克洛特民族、及羅馬尼亞之雪爾凡尼亞民族、皆屬天主敎徒、或將被引而歸附奧國、聞英·法·意·等大國、對於奧國復辟、現已不甚反對、三國領袖咸以為奧國恢復帝制之後、或能遏阻希特勒在中南歐之野心、若大國不加反對、則小協約國之改變態度、亦為時間問題而已、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>奧陸軍大檢閱　總理勗勵軍人　合力爭取獨立</h3>
<p>（維也納）本日奧國陸軍舉行大閱典禮、由許希尼格總理致訓詞、希望奧國陸軍恪遵故陶爾斐斯總理之遺轍、卽合力以爭取奧國獨立幸福及權利是也、（七日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>奧局又形緊張　衝鋒隊與內衛團傾軋　兩極端派復乘隙思動</h3>
<p>（維也納）奧局今日又形緊張、蓋政府之兩大私人軍隊、卽許士經格總理之衝鋒隊及史泰亨堡親王之內衛團、傾軋甚烈、國家社會黨及共產黨又復乘隙思動、至於衝鋒隊與內衛團之嫉視、以某方擬擠史泰亨堡任攝政為主因、史泰亨堡之為攝政、不過為哈布斯堡復辟之過渡、兩軍近在小鎭時起衝突、維也納方面復有風說、謂許士尼格總理有倦勤之意、其所奉行之法西主義亦已成强弩之末云、（七日國民電）</p>
<h3>全德今日懸旗　慶祝歐戰大將誕辰</h3>
<p>（柏林）德元首希特勒通令全國各機關、於本月九日一律懸旗、慶祝歐戰時德國大將盧登多夫之七十生辰、令文云、吾人為紀念大將之功蹟起見、應於本月九日一律升旗致敬云云、（八日國民電）</p>
<h3>但澤議會改選結果　德國社黨夙願未償　未獲三分之二票數　改憲劃空成夢想</h3>
<p>但澤　市議會選舉結果暫行公布如下一國社黨一三九。七二九票、（此在一九三三年五月之選舉則為一〇九·七二九票）、社會民主黨三七·〇一五票、（前為三七·八八二票）、共產黨七·九九〇票、（前為一四·五六六票）、天主敎中央黨三一·五二五票、（前為三一·三三六票）、德國國權黨九·六九一票、（前為一三·五九六票）、波蘭人八·一三〇票、前為六·七四三票、反對前參戰軍人三八五票、</p>
<p>綜計國社黨所得票數、不及總數百分之六十、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>但澤　昨日選舉之結果、國社黨大為失望、據最後數字、新議會各黨所佔之席數如下、</p>
<p>國社黨四四、社會民主黨一二、中央黨九、日耳曼國民黨三、共產黨與法蘭黨各二、國社黨僅佔上次增多四席耳、自一九三三年七月任但澤行政主席至一九三四年辭職之羅斯樞林博士、今日逃離此間、大約乃赴波蘭、聞國社黨視之為叛徒、擬加以不利、德宣傳部長戈培爾星期六日演說時曾稱、國社黨無庸注意如羅氏其人者、因羅氏已作精神上之自殺也、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>但澤　昨日但澤新議會之選舉、德國宣傳機關雖竭力運動、志在獲三分之二之大多數、俾得呈請國聯變更自由城之憲法、然其結果僅得五分之三之多數、此次國社黨獲票之總數、較之一九三三年上次選舉約多三萬票、</p>
<p>當檢票之際、但澤波政府之代表謂此次選舉之際、德人曾施用恐怖手段、故應認為不合法云、據該代表照會但澤當道稱、其辦公處所用之波員二人、昨日侵晨曾遭毆擊、應賠償其損失云、昨晨九時開始投票、人民赴投票處者約二十五人、至下午、選民之投票者、已達百分之七十矣、是日城中旗幟飛揚、各黨紛在市中作示威運動、但除毆擊二波員外、並未發生其他事端、德政府曾以旅費供給但澤公民六千人、並備專車接送前來投票、且派能員如德元首之心腹赫斯·薩爾之德代表布克爾·宣傳部長戈培爾·普魯士總統戈林等來此宣傳、滿期可得三分之二之多數、藉以變更自由城之憲法而脫離國聯之保護、不意竟未如願也、（八日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）各報以為但澤自由市議會此次選舉、雖經德國國社黨極力宣傳、但若將其結果與一九三三年選舉相比較、則可認為半失敗、或認為半成功、小巴黎人報載、「此項失敗最後若果證實、則德國方面、必將發生深刻之反響、而認為國社主義首次失利、蓋德國若欲依照合法程序、修正但澤市現行憲法、而將但澤市行政與德國行政合而為一、則國社黨必須獲得總票數三分之二、始乃有濟、此外若干政界方面則深恐此次選舉結果、德國如失所望、則國社黨或將舉行武力政變」云、該報又謂、「國社黨大事宣傳、忽遽間竟獲勝利、此則由於團結一致與有組織之所致、國社黨此次小獲勝利、殊足惶恐、蓋將使德國政府之壓迫政策、為之繼續不輟也、」事業報則謂、「國聯會對於但澤市之現行制度、當視昔日尤加注意、日昨德國宣傳部長戈培爾所發但澤市遲早必將投入德國懷中之言、國聯會尤宜牢記、蓋此語不啻對國聯會之挑釁行為、同時為對波蘭之嚴重警吿也」云、（八日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>金銀</p>
<p>倫敦金價今晨又暴漲、掛牌爲一四四先令十一便士、比星期六日高十便士、此乃英鎊鬆動之故、</p>
<p>倫敦銀市今日在掛牌以前、人氣頗形不定、預料今日將漲〇六二五、但掛脾價格、現貨爲二十八便士四三七五、與前價同、期貨則爲二十八便士五六二五、漲〇六二五、印度與中國午前皆買賣兼營、收盤價穩、</p>
<p>孟買銀市今日亦平靜、現貨開盤價爲六十八羅比、較星期六日收盤髙二安那、此便迄十二時一刻未有變更、市况殊乏精彩、</p>
<p>滙兌</p>
<p>英美　用金國幣價星期六收盤時之漲風、因用金國保護其貨幣之能力稍爲人信任而起者、今晨仍未息、不過以整個言、外滙市况頗爲沉寂也、操業者在上週之杪、曾爭先將其金幣換爲英鎊、今日態度不復似前之惶遽、故英鎊需求稍覺平息、因此之故、以金幣及美元計之、英鎊現已疲弱、英美滙價開盤爲四元八角二分二五、較星期六日美英滙兌收盤價格低落二分一二五、午前微有起色、但午時稍形停頓、午後二時價爲四元八角三分一二五、較開盤漲八七五、市况較爲淸淡、又美金一元、合英金四先令一便士六七六、</p>

<p>棉麥</p>
<p>紐約棉花　棉市開盤、約漲五磅音、但在第一小時内、漲起之數幾皆跌去、市况轉形清淡、交易甚滯、幣價波動想似憶平息、棉市中操縱市價之一要素、因此消滅、以言氣候、棉帶東部有雨、但非棉農之所需也、對手貫捐之壓力、現日見增高、傳說有人勸總統行使其特權、取銷此捐、</p>
<p>芝加哥麥　開盤約漲一分、溫尼佩格之市價糧價格漲起、乾區範圍漸小、惟統計地位、利於價格之髙起、</p>
<p>利物浦棉　今有較穩趨向、午後一時七月期賣方素價爲六·一三、較星期六日收盤、高起六磅音、</p>
<p>利物浦麥　今日市價稍低、因星期六日價格高起後、獲利了結者紛起、而芝加哥麥市、星期六日收盤時亦低落也、午後一時、七月期價爲五先令七便士、較星期六日低去一二五、</p>
<p>孟買棉市　今日價格略起、惟市况沉寂、七八月期白洛志棉價爲二百二十二羅比、較星期六日髙起二羅比、此價午前未動、</p>

<p>紐約　今日開盤因倫敦價格低落、故跌二十磅音、開盤後半小時內、跌風不息、橡皮市况似全爲國外市塲所左右、本國各種市塲現雖堅强、然無絲毫影響及於橡皮市塲、商人皆抱束手旁觀態度、</p>
<p>證券</p>
<p>紐約　除鐵路股票壓力頗大、及公用股票散戶賣出外、今晨證券市塲一般價格、皆視前爲髙、開盤時人氣轉佳、市况堅穩、星期六日所發現對於獲利了結之抵抗、已使脚地愈形堅穩、今日衆覺苟稍有利於市况之消息、即可促成價格之上趣、但一般消息、未有精彩、開盤後半小時內、鐵路與公用股票所遭之壓力、已不復存在、開盤時之微漲、後漸擴大、而高起一二磅音、市况尙形活動、人氣亦穩、茲將紐約證券市價列左、</p>

<h3>蔣委員長抵黔後　貴陽煥然一新　中央軍施行新生活運動　蔣委長努力建設及實業</h3>
<p>字林報四月一日貴陽通訊云、蔣軍委長偕其夫人於三月二十四日乘飛機抵此、地方官大爲興奮、人民尤爲注意、近年來中央政府之大吏絕無至黔者、今赫赫要員、翩然蒞止、故全城懸旗結綵、表示歡迎、且因蔣軍委長爲新生活之倡導者、故全城日來打掃潔凈、煥然一新、</p>
<p>方共匪距省垣不遠、省軍正謀刦掠全城而於翌日退走之際、中央軍突然開至、於是地方乃得轉危爲安、商店初皆半閉其門、店主密藏其貴重物品、束手以待大禍之降臨、萬不料救星突至、於是皆如學童之雀躍歡忭、而省軍則殊怏快、蓋因此坐失一甚佳之機會也、自是商店乃全開市、街道亦經大掃除、空氣爲之全變、中央軍並出任巡街警察、其待遇人民之和藹、爲向來軍人所未有者、軍隊中旋卽自行開始新生活運動、並派衣特別制服者、在各街道指導人民、若輩不携武器、僅携一警棍、但並不揮擊諸鄉愚之背也、</p>
<p>蔣軍委長曾在城中步巡多次、並與各大員會商一切、而注目於本省之大局、本省烟氛彌漫、人民多染鴉片姻癖、蔣軍委長現切欲淸除此毒、然於談話之際、表示積習已深、若不先助農民改種他物、及爲受毒者解除其癮、未可驟然下令禁止種吸、日者複於談話之際聲稱、今日之急務、當完全變更國人關於用人從事生產工作之觀念、易言之、卽當發展天然利源與改良農業是也、</p>
<p>蔣軍委長恒從事建築道路開關遠地之政策、其至此也亦然、蔣曾在重慶下令儘速完成自重慶達黔北並長沙入黔之公路、此間現亦築路至省北、俾與重慶貫通、蔣並以爲今當急事發展小實業、以利用天然產品、距此約八九十哩、有一髙三百呎之瀑布、大可用以發生電力、供給全省、貴陽雖設有小電廠、每夜自七時至十二時有電燈可用、但全城唯數處十字路口裝有電燈、其餘道路及大半居戶、入夜卽皆漆黑、加以運輸維艱、火油之價奇昻、普通人民、皆無力購用、故天色旣矄、卽家家閉戶就寢、道中罕有人跡矣、本省產煤甚富、而含有琉璜質、蔣軍委長深知此爲可事發展之一種實業、蓋可供給築路所用之油脂、或尙可煉製汽油、其副產品、或能用製顏料也、蔣並覺今宜大購化學肥料、以增髙農產、且當利用荒山、以事畜牧、苗族頗知此道、故其牛羊蕃息、蔣此次飛行至此、深知此間旅行之困難、故擬以發展交通爲務、往日乘橋由重慶來此、須需十七日、今乘飛機、僅需兩小時、將來公路築成、如常保平坦、則兩日亦可抵矣、本省礦產極富、惜皆棄諸於地、日者蔣軍委長曾稱、渠擬從事調査、以謀開採云、</p>
<p>自中央軍抵省後、卽將共匪擊敗、現方追逐於後、今不難指日肅淸也、</p>

<h3>藝展預展會昨晨開幕　中西人士前往參觀者千餘人</h3>
<p>中央社云、倫敦中國藝術展覽會上海預展會、已於昨日上午九時開幕、天氣雖甚惡劣、而前往參觀之中西人士、仍接踵而至、其中遠道專誠前來參觀及研究我國各項藝術品者、頗不乏人、想今明天氣轉佳後、參觀者當更踴躍也、茲將昨日情形、探誌如下、</p>
<p>陳列各物　價重連城</p>
<p>會中陳列之古物、類多價重連城、商周各代之銅器、足爲我國開化最早之鐵證、至如書畫之類、溶歷代各宗派之作品於一爐、對研究是項藝術者、當可收融會貫通之效、且其中各項圖畫、純爲代表東方風味、而未稍受西方畫派之影響如近代之國畫者、將來在倫敦展覽時、當更足壓彼邦人士之望也、又如董北苑龍宿郊民圖、郭熙羣峰霽雪等、皆屬驚心動魄之作、尤以乾隆眞蹟及世祖之墨鍾馗、爲外間不易見到之作、故到會者咸欣賞不止云、</p>
<p>擷其精項　可窺全豹</p>
<p>古物中選自故宮博物院及古物陳列所者爲最多、此項古物、往昔在故宮陳列展覽時、每人門票須售一元、而復須三日始能走遍故宮各殿、以窺全豹、今則擷其精英、又綜合中央研究院·北平圖書館·河南博物館·安徽省立圖書館、送會陳列之古物、而得於一日之間、全部瀏覽之、則不論在時間及金錢上、均經濟多多矣、</p>
<p>王召高級　人員談話</p>
<p>昨日上午、敎育部長王世杰氏、復一度蒞會、並召集高級人員談話、其內容則爲關於今後預展會事及古物運英諸問題者、王氏至十二時、始離會他去、</p>
<p>添售券處　更見便利</p>
<p>該會前爲整餘場秩序起見、曾擬不在門首售券、現爲便利觀衆起見、特在門首、設立臨時售券處、兼及中國銀行之各辦事處·及上海銀行之各分行·故此後擬往參觀者、對購券將益見便利矣、</p>
<p>中英目錄　參照瀏覽</p>
<p>該會又爲便利觀衆參與說明、瀏覽古物起見、特印有中英文詳細目錄各一册、中文本每册收回印刷費大洋五角、英文本大洋一元、外觀內容、均甚美觀充實、綜計昨日全日售出中英文本各千餘冊、現在向承印之商務印書館催繳該項書籍、外埠人士、欲購該項目錄者、亦可備價向該會郵購云、</p>
<p>昨往參觀　二千餘人</p>
<p>昨日前往該會參觀者、有二千餘人、中外男女人士各半、都對藝術欣賞程度甚高、故多相互研討詳述、外人對書畫緙絲贊美尤多、而名聞世界之中國瓷器·該會特自宋定窯起、作系統之陳列、以迄遜淸乾隆、其中瓷坏、釉彩·設色·綸圖·之進步、尤多興味云、</p>
<p>葉恭綽對　藝展意見</p>
<p>葉恭綽氏最近發表其對於「倫敦中國藝術國際展覽」之意見、頗足供前往參觀者之參考、茲轉錄如下、吾國藝術及美術工藝，向來馳名世界、（除一部分人欠缺認識者外、）但吾國國內向乏大規模之陳列所·及專門研究之機關、故有系統之搜集·保管·陳列·整理·流通·均所欠缺、致一般人欲硏究吾國藝術者、每苦無從下手、反須求之外人所著之書籍、及外人所辦之博物院等、（故宮博物院及古物陳列所藏物雖多、然以整理尙未就緒、故不能充分供給此項需要）吾國此次參加倫敦之國際我國藝術展覽、雖未能達到何項大目的、但足令一般人對我國藝術增加若干認識、或重估其價値、自不失爲有意義之舉動、而未出國以前、先開預展、令本國人先得參觀與硏究之機會、辦法亦殊適當、外間對於此會一切籌備經過、議論頗多、但平心而論、吾國辦此等事、尙爲創舉、自不能求全責備、最可惜者、似有二點、（一）因限於公家出品、而又有種種原因、不能充分自由提選、故出品是否即可代表我國藝術之全部、不無疑問、（二）因有種種原因、不能將出品成爲有系統有意義之組織、未免缺少「史」的意味、故足供欣賞而稍乏供人硏究之功能、此二者成因亦甚複雜、茲姑不詳述、惟望當局以後辦理此等事、須多徵求專家之意見、方始進行、且須預備充分時間、母臨時倉卒交卷、如出國陳列、更須知彼知己、妥定計劃與步驟、庶免因應失宜、虛糜財力、如斯而已、至此次出品、大體可分爲書畫·磁器·銅器·絲繡·漆器·玉器·六項、書畫總額計一百六十三件、故宮博物院出品居十分之八、此外餘則古物陳列所出品、依余個人之意甚、願將歷代各派之代表書畫、充分選送、以表見吾國各派書畫之眞相、但事實上、此兩機關之書畫、不能各派俱全、（亦有有而不佳者）各人挑選之標準、亦不能悉歸一致、此外尙有其他事實、須受束縛者、故結果如現選之目錄、此目錄蓋經中英雙方專家同意、而爲籌備委員會所核定者、雖不敢謂我國書畫佳品、悉備於是、然此目錄中、並無劣等之物、蓋可斷言也、至各家作品中、間有未能代表其人生平之品詣者、如米南宮·趙子昂·之畫、均非其至精之作、此則限於事實、無可如何也、（故宮藏物、前淸即陸續失去不少、至民國後、溥儀未出宮前、所失尤多、即賞溥佶一單、其中書畫即一千八百餘件、皆六朝唐宋元明之精華也、）然著名劇蹟、如董北苑龍宿郊民圖·郭熙羣峰霽雪等、皆屬驚心動魄之作、足以壓倒一切者、磁器一項、淸宮所藏、本較他物爲完備、此次又經郭君葆昌、先在北平精心選擇、來滬覆勘、故出品精良、且歷代各窰各式大略均備、預計國內外藏品、决無如此之完備者、惜宋以前陶磁器、未及蒐羅、此亦因限於故宮之故、銅器·此次出品不多、就近日出土各器之質與量而言、此項出一品、尙不足以代表、惟吾國研究銅器、向重文字、而式樣花紋次之、如以文字言、此類出品、亦大有可觀、此外絲繡類、則宋緙絲各件山水人物花鳥均備、洵屬鉅觀、（南方尤少見此類緙絲）、元明淸之緙絲、亦不失爲精品、緙絲刺繡、本甫方所獨擅、今已衰落失傳、可歎也、（今蘇州木凟尙有人能製緙絲、繡工則蘇湘粵均擅名、但實際遠不如昔）、雕漆則明永樂宣德嘉靖淸乾隆均有、玉器則多以做工勝、欲研究吾國古玉、尙不能恃故宮之物爲資料、此則國人多知之、無待贅言池、此次倫敦之會、係徵求各國所藏之我國藝術品、並非專向我國徵求、我國藝術品歷年流出國外者甚多、吾國所有者、或不逮他人之精、如有意競爭、自須積極預行組織、但我國公私機關、本身組織、多未健全、欲其集合活動、殊多困難、經此次以後、國人增加覺悟與經騐、他日必有好希望也、抑近日一般排斥精神文明者、每謂今日所需、端在物質建設、此外乃不急之務、對保存古物等、尤不以爲然、不知一國之民族精神、往往繫留於以往之文物、故左如蘇俄右如意大利、對於一切藝術、及美術品、皆極端提倡與保護、不過其宗旨、與吾國往昔之僅供個人玩賞者不同、故吾國應該速行建設大衆藝術、一面保存及發揚固有藝術、以爲之基、而不徒以個人玩賞、或盲從破壞爲事、此又所望於預展之觀衆、聞風興起者也、</p>
<p>英文名稱　略有更改</p>

<p>某專家談　選擇經過</p>
<p>新聲社記者昨晨晤參加提選之某專家、據談、此次陳列各品、珍貴者甚多、其中如商周銅器、爲我國歷史上之瓖寳、在世界古物中、無與倫比、宋元明淸名窰瓷器、亦我國特產、因瓷器携帶不便、流出國外較少、此次運英展覽、尙屬創舉、古版書籍、爲世界最早之印刷書版、尤爲名貴、北平圖書館古書、本不允參加、後經籌委會再三要求、始允運來、至古代書畫、因流出頗多、外人頗有鑒別力、英國派來之五專家、對此選擇奇苛、於絹本各畫、無不以顯微鏡照之、有南宋某古畫、英專家認圖中壺形類淸物、疑非眞蹟、摒而勿錄、但外人迷信帝王、專擇有乾隆嘉慶御寳硃印者、致若干名畫未能人選、至郞世寗之書、籌委會因郞爲西人、不足以代表我國文化、擬不選、後循英委要求、始選兩幅、至玉器類各品、則比較减色云、</p>

<p>昨晚招待報界話別中央社云、駐士耳其國公使賀耀組氏、定於明日乘意郵船康特凡第號赴歐轉土履新、昨晚七時、假新亞酒樓、招待本埠新聞界、到各報各通訊社記者五十餘人、席間賀氏申述公使之抱負甚詳、辭畢、由嚴獨鶴代表新聞界答謝、並舉杯祝賀公使健康、至九時許始散、茲將賀氏演詞錄後今天鄙人得到這個機會、與諸位聚會一堂、非常愉快、心中覺得有許多話要說、但是因爲個人不善演說的緣故、恐怕不能暢所欲言、凡是民治的國家、無不尊車民衆的意見、所以公意（Pnblicopinion）一詞、不但是歐美人士日益注意、就是我國人亦較前注意得多、書經中說得好、「天視自我民視、天聽自我民聽」、可知古代的政治、也就是重視民意的政治、但是進一步說、民意由何表現、興論就是民意的表現、至少是一部分民意的表一、現問與論如何造成、民衆出誰領導、根據「先知覺後知、先覺覺後覺」、的話着想、造成輿論的、領導民衆的、當然是學識優秀、在社會上有地位的人、據鄙人看來、新聞界的領袖、因爲地位和機會的關係、對於領導民衆、造成輿論、是有最大的力量、這種觀念、不是完全由於理想的結果、而是觀察事實後所得的結論、例如過去的發生許多不幸的事變、國內輿論界、或是採取消極的態度、或是發表積極的評論、如對於以前閩局的收拾、實是有很重大的關係、那是人所共知的事實、不必多說的、總之、數十年來、我國社會的種種改進、得力於與淪的幫助不少、任何改進的成功、若不是由於新聞界倡議於前、便是■★★■■★■■★★由一新聞界贊助於後、始能事半功倍、輕而易舉、否則、必不免事倍功半、勞而寡功、再推廣說、輿論的力量、不但是對於內政之興革有關係、對於外交之成敗、亦大有關係、不但在我國如此、在其他先進國家亦莫不如此、說到此處、鄙人不但是對於在座諸君要表示誠摯的敬意、並且對於新聞界的全體、要陳述熱烈的企望、爲搜尋改善我國國計民生的途徑起見、爲宣傳世界和平、國際協作的福音起見、祝諸君康健、請諸君努力、耀組此番到土耳其、還是初次出使、對於外交是沒有經騐的、土其耳在我國還沒有設過使館、我國在土耳其設立使館、亦是創辦、鄙人學識淺薄、對於如此重大的使命、不敢說可以勝任、惟有盡心竭力、以國家的利　爲前提、以民衆的意見爲後盾、遇事審愼考慮、以求不負使命而已、自從政府委任鄙人出使土耳其的命令發表後、就有許多公私團體、和與論的機關、不吝賜敎、或者對於中土兩國之外交有所指示或者對於土耳其復興事蹟之因果、有所諮詢、這是一般國人注意國事的象徵、鄙人心中、覺得有一種異常的欣感、更覺得有許多話要說、但是鄙人在未達到目的地、未作實地硏究的工夫以前、不敢多發表意見、而且在今天的塲合、爲時間所限、亦不容多發表意見、但鄙人甚願以後將實際硏究土耳其的資料、或將硏究的結果、在可能時、隨時供給國內各關係機關和團體、俾資參考、關於土耳其復興的事實、及中土兩國民族政治的比較、鄙人前日曾在中央黨部有一個報吿、此種報吿、雖曾經少數報紙披露、但恐國人尙有未知、特再將前日報吿的大意、作一個簡明的陳述、先說民族的比較、（一）兩個民族都是黄種、並且因爲唐太宗貞觀四年、有將近十萬突厥人、歸於我國、居於中土之故、現今已一千三百多年、突厥人與漢回可以通婚、因此兩族血統、應當有一部分近似之處、（二）但是因爲居處的不同、和氣候的不同、土耳其民族、在中古和近古的時代、還是遊牧民族、我國早巳從事農桑、在周朝的以前、巳經成爲耕種之族了、（三）土耳其民族、在數百年前、生活仍然極爲簡單、所居亦不固定、所以屢有遷徙、我族生活複雜、起居安適、所以一向安土重遷、（四）往昔的土耳其民族、富有極强烈的自我意識、對於外來的文化和思想、不輕接受、我族一向富有包含性、日有同化力、對於外來的文化、頗能兼收並蓄、（五）土耳其民族、從未全部被他族征服、是以性情倔强剛直、富有冒險進取的精神、漢族不幸曾被元淸征服、是以不免减低民族的自尊心、和自信力、因之我族缺乏國家觀念和政治興趣、而野心</p>

<p>的國家、對俄國遂啓覬覦侵略之念、再說政治的比較、（一）兩國都是亞洲的大國、但是我國比較土耳其更加地大·物博·人衆、立國更爲悠久、社會組織更爲繁複、（領土的面積是一比十、人口的數目約一比三十、）（二）兩國的政體、都是先爲君主專制、後爲民主共和、但是我國君主政體的時間和民主政體的時間都較久、（土耳其民主國成立於中華民國十二年、）（三）兩國都曾屢次拓展國土、發揚國威、但是所採取之方略、頗有不同、土耳其完全採用征服方式、（例如征服巴爾幹各民族）近於霸道、我國向來主張王道政治、如「三苗不服、則舞于戚、三苗自來服、王道的精神、在歷史上、能使鮮卑·契丹·女眞·苗蠻·各族同化、又常用王道融化附近小民族、（例如對髙麗·越南·緬甸·暹邏·等所持之懷柔政策、）（四）近百年來、兩國都有過多次的內亂、但是內亂的原因不同、性質不同、在十九世紀之中、土耳其帝國內統治之異族、受了革命思潮的刺激、常起內亂、紛紛獨立、我國內統治之異族、極少叛變獨立之事、土耳其民主國成立之後、本民族非常團結、就是在成立以前的兩次革命、亦都是採取和平手段、避免流血、我國同族之人常起內閧、甚至民國成立以後、還有過幾次毫無意義的混戰、這或者是因爲漢族人數校土耳其族人多至數十倍、而國人又囿於歷史的演替、不能改過遷善的所致、（五）近百年來都有外患、同受列强的欺凌、和經濟的剝削、又都曾喪失許多領土、喪失一部分國袱、訂了多種不平等條約、（最著者如領事裁判　、和關稅限制的條欵等、）現在土耳其已經恢復國權、逹到目的、我國應當見賢思齊、猛着祖鞭了、可資比較約幾點、旣經撮要略述、現在把個人認爲土耳其復興成功之要素　可資我國借鏡的特點提出來、請　君指敎、（一）研究土耳其復興的事　、最可使我們驚異的、是何以歐戰後土耳其在四面楚歌、日暮途窮之際、竟然能在期年之間、轉危爲安呢、爲搜求這個答案，我們發見了土耳其與我國最大不同之點、就是土耳其人當風雨飄搖之時、是眞誠的絕對的和衷共濟、他們從來不發生內戰、他們始終聚精會神、一致對外、這就是他們、在最短期間內達到成功第一個因素、（二）土耳其人沒有混戰、雖然是成功的因素、但這還不過是消極方面的優點、若探討其積極的因素、固然是因爲有一個賢明的領袖、把全國民衆喚醒起來、組織起來，尤其是因爲多數民衆、能深知國家的危難、一律服從有紀律的領導、努力前進的緣故、不然的話能不能打破嚴重的國難仍然是絕大的疑問、換句話說、有賢明的領袖、良好的組織、森嚴的紀律、奮發有爲、精誠團結的民衆、就是土耳其在最短期間、完成復興的第二個因素、（三）還有値得特別注意的、是土耳其國民軍、人人都知道小亞細亞是土耳其民族居住的地方、就是土耳其的生有綫爲民族的生有計、無論如何犧牲、他們是不顧的、所以希臘軍隊、一天不退出小亞細亞、國民軍就一天不停的去攻擊、這種以保障其國家生存之目的而組織的軍隊、這種認淸敵人、誓死奮鬭、堅持無畏的精神、不但是復興土耳其的中心武力、也就是復興土耳其民族的靈魂、這就是他們在最短期間、達到成功的第三個因素、（四）最後做更進一步的探討、當土耳其四面楚歌之際、國民軍的敵人非常之多、除了希臘人以外、不但有英國軍隊、還有法義兩國的軍隊、土耳其國民軍雖然勇敢、但是寡不敵衆、形勢甚爲危急、到一九二一年、法義兩國撤兵、形勢始爲之一轉、何以兩國忽然撤兵呢、是因爲他們懾於士耳其國民軍的戰鬭力嗎、絕對不是的、法義兩國政府、所以下令撤兵、是因爲土耳其國民政府、和他們兩國眞有妥恊的諒解、締結了互利的恊約之故、土耳其國民黨若不能辨明利害之輕重、從大處着眼、便不能認淸主敵、若不是有整個的外交政策、便不肯以利餌敵、亦不能使侵略者自亂陣綫、所以靈敏的外交、具有卓識的外交、就是他們在最短期間、完成復興的第四個因素、前不久列强還把土耳其看作病夫、欺凌他、剝削他還不够、千方百計的想分奪他的產業、歐戰後、土耳其所處的地位、比我國今日還要危險十倍、但是經過數年奮鬭和努力之後、氣象一新、他在國際政治舞臺上與列强分庭抗禮、列强對他、亦不得不另眼相看了、我國地大物博、人民衆多、若能舉國奮興、精誠團結、把土耳其復興成功的幾種因素、作爲借鑑、一一切實施行、豈不可以一日千里之勢、與列强爭雄、何止與土耳其並駕齊驅而已、今天晚上蒙諸位光臨、非常感謝、再過兩天、鄙人就要出國、籍此機會向各位吿別、臨別之前、再要說一句話、無論在鄙人動身之前、或動身之後、無論那一位有何指敎、鄙人無不竭誠歡迎、最後請諸位共飲一杯、祝中華民國萬歲、祝中華國民康樂、</p>

<h3>社會局　倡組工農合作社</h3>
<p>本市合作事業、自社會局積極提倡以來、殊有蓬勃氣象、而一般市民亦漸明瞭合作社之意義、能自動組織者、頗不乏人、故合作社之數量、亦日見增、茲將該局最近合作事業之推進概况及計劃、分分別詳述於下、</p>
<p>（一）提倡工人消費合作事業</p>
<p>提倡動機</p>
<p>本市爲全國工廠重鎭、據最近統計、工廠工人在三十六萬人以上、（碼頭及交通工人等約三十餘萬）此類之工人、均依賴工資爲主、然因無消費合作社之組織、生活上必需品之購買、輒受中間商人之層層剝削、而工人之生活旨、無形减削、於是日處於窮困愁苦之境、而不能自拔、甚至釀成失業等等重大問題、擾及社會安寗之秩序、故工人消費合作社之提倡、誠爲當務之急、不容稍緩、此非僅足以解决一般工人所受經濟壓迫之痛苦、且間接可以維持社會之安寗、茲將其實施計劃錄後、</p>
<p>劃分區域</p>
<p>本市工人消費合作社之組織、依據本市工人之區域劃分之、第一區包括南區、第二區、包括法租界、第三區、包括公共租界、北四川路以西、蘇州河以南、第四區包括公共租界北四川路以東、第五區包括洋涇塘橋陸行楊思等四區、第六區包括閘北彭浦等二區、第七區包括江灣引翔殷行等三區、第八區包括吳淞高橋等三區、第九區包括法華漕涇等二區、第十區包括蒲淞區、第十一區包括眞如區、凡平時僱用工人在三百以上、應每廠設立一工人消費合作社、其僱用工人較少之工廠、應就近聯合兩廠以上成立一合作社、但規模較小之工廠、認爲有設立消費合作社之必要、而願自動紙織者、悉聽其便、消費合作社、</p>
<p>分期舉行</p>
<p>本市區域遼闊、倘同時舉辦、則進行殊多困難、分爲三期舉辦、循序漸進、以牧普及之效、第一期第一區、第二期第二第三第四第五第六等區、第三期第七第八第九第十第十一等區、消費合作社之名稱、應爲某某工廠（公司或社）俟第一期各區工廠之消費合作社辦有成績後、再舉辦第二期第三期所列舉之各區、但各該區工廠、願先期自動組織消費合作社者、亦聽其便、每區埸之工廠已多數成立消費合作社後、應即着手組織各該區之消費合作社聯合社在開始組織聯合社時、應由各該區工會員籌備之責、並得借工會會址爲聯合社之辦事　、</p>
<p>宣傳指導</p>
<p>在宣傳方面、分爲（一）印製小冊子、將消費合作要義組織方法、一及經營槪要、川通俗文字加以說明、分送於各區工會工廠、（二）組織合作會演講、由該局聘請對於有合作及經騐學識之人、定期演講關於消費之原理組織、及經營方法等問題、令各區工會負責人來局聽講、然後再由各該區工會、負責設法向各工廠宣傳、又演講會因環境之需要、得往各區巡廻演講、（三）各區工會工廠、除設有勞工學校、或演講會等、專爲用工人受補習敎育之用者、應盡量將合作社原理及經營等問題、向工人講述、務使不識字之工人均能有相當之了解、關於指導方面、在本市各區工廠之消費合作社、或合作社聯合社、在新成立時、其經營有不甚合宜、或辦理錯誤、應由該局隨時派員考核指導、（一）由該局遴選富於合作學識經騐之人員、派充爲指導員、隨時至各區工廠之消費合作社、或聯合社加以考核指導、（二）對於各該區域消費合作社、或聯合社認爲有詳細指導之必要時、得派員暫駐於各區巡迴指導之、（三）該局工廠檢査員、至各工廠檢査時、對於已成立之消費合作社、得隨時加以注意考察並指導之、</p>
<p>進行甄別</p>
<p>（一）各區工廠之消費合作社、或聯合社在初成立時、即應依照手續、呈局登記、（二）該局對於各區工廠成立之消費合作社、或聯合社經甄別後、認爲有成績者准其立案、（三）各區工廠之消費合作社或聯合社、經甄別認爲辦理有優良之成績者、得由本局予以下列獎勵、甲、傳令嘉獎、乙、頒給獎章、或獎狀、（四）各區工廠之消費合作社、或聯合社、經甄別認爲辦理不善時、得予以下列之懲戒、甲、傳令申斥、乙、經兩次以上之書面巾斥而仍不改善者、得勒令改組、該項計劃、經由該局呈奉市政府核准後、即用招考方式、任用工廠消費合作社指導員六人、扭任調査宣傳及指導工作、現已指定滬南區先行試辦、並按日派指導員、至各工廠指導、幷帮助其組織消費合作社、現本市各工廠已成立合作社有十三家、其餘在籌備中者約二十家、（未完）</p>
<h3>京渝間交通益便　中航公司特闢京渝航空快班　一千四百餘公里可一日到達</h3>

<h3>論「文人相輕」（一）</h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>「吾家」子桓，在一千八百年前說了一句「文人相輕，自古而然」的話，便給一些人拿來做「人身攻擊」的辯護和解釋。有時看見所謂文人在那里「相罵」，就說是「文人相輕」，而一切嚴正的批評，也混作「相輕」一例看，以爲批評就是相駡。似乎「吾家」子桓並不這樣說的罷。</p>
<p>典論論文於「文人相輕，自古而然」之下，緊接着班固批評傅毅的話，說「武仲（傅毅字）以能屬文，爲蘭台令史，下筆不能自休。班固說傅毅「下筆不能自休，」那是技巧上的批評，所謂「相輕」，只是這樣地「相輕」；所以子桓解釋「相輕」的原由，說：「夫人蕃於自見，而文非一體，鮮能備善，是以各以所長，相輕所短。」其後他說了建安七子，，也便說：「斯七子者，於學無所遺，於辭無所假，咸以自騁驥驟於千里，仰齊足而並馳，以此相服，亦良難矣！」嚴格說來，「文人相輕」只是一種「批評，决不含「相駡」的意味在。</p>
<p>我現在謬託知己，把「吾家」子桓所謂「文人相輕」的意義來仔細揮發一下。</p>
<p>劉勰謂「人之禀才，遲速異分。…駿發之士，心總要術，敏在慮前，應機立斷；覃思之人，情饒歧路，鑒在疑後，研慮方定；機敏故造次而成功，慮疑故愈久而致績。」（文心雕龍：神思）如司馬相如作上林子虛，專心致意，差不多寫了百天纔成功。黃祖長子射大會賓客，人有獻鸚鵡者：射請彌衡作賦，彌衡擥筆而作，「文無加點，辭采甚麗。」這兩位賦家，遲速之間，相差到這樣程度，究竟誰高誰下呢？漢武故事載：「上（漢武）好詞賦，每行幸及奇獸異物，輒命相如等賦之，上亦自作詩賦數百篇，下筆而成，初不留思。相如造文彌時而後成，上每歡其工妙。謂相如曰：「以吾之速，易子之遲可乎？」相如曰：「於臣則可，未知陛下何如耳？」上大笑而不責。」他們君臣之間，一遲一速都有點自負，各不相讓的。西京雜記謂：「枚皋文章敏疾，長卿制作淹遲，皆盡一時之譽；而長卿首尾溫麗，枚皋時有累句，故知疾行無善迹矣，」言下頗有推重相如之意。而三國誌的作者陳壽稱王餐：「舉筆便　成，無所改定，時人常以爲宿構：然正復精意覃恩，亦不能加也。」稱曹植作銅雀台賦，「援筆立成，可觀。」亦深致傾倒之意。作家之間，旣顯然有這兩類不同的手法，便容易「各以所長，相輕所短」了。</p>
<p>文人的重形式和重內容，差不多在每個時代都有非常紛歧的議論。齊梁間大史家裴子野作雕蟲論，反對以修飾爲能事的尙文傾向，謂：「閭閻少年，貴游總角，罔不　落六藝，吟詠情性；學者以博依爲急務，謂章句爲顓魯，淫文破典，斐爾爲功，無被於管弦，非止乎禮義。…其興浮，其志弱，巧而不要，隱而不深……荀卿有言，「亂代之徵，文章匿而乎。」斯豈近之乎？」梁簡文帝看了，大不高興：答湘東王書云……又時有效謝康樂，裴鴻臚（子野）文者，亦頗有惑焉。何者？謝客吐言天抜，出於自然，時有不拘，是其糟粕。裴氏乃是良史之才，了無篇什之美。是爲學謝則不屆其精華，但得其冗長；師裴則蔑絕其所長，惟得其所短。謝故巧不可階，裴亦質不宜慕。…故玉徽金銑，反爲拙目所嗤，巴人下里，更合郢中之聽。陽春高而不和，妙聲絕而不尋，竟不精討錙銖，覈量文質，有異巧心，終愧妍手。是以握瑜懷玉之士，瞻鄭邦而知退；章甫翠履之人，望閩鄉而嘆息。詩旣若此，筆又如之，徒以烟墨不言，受其驅染，紙札無情，任其搖襞：甚矣哉，文之橫流，一至於此！」這樣針錄相對的你一刀我一槍，煞是好看。再加以二者之間，又殺出第三位好漢來，顏之推文章篇云：「今世相承，趨末棄末，率爲浮　。辭與理競，辭勝而理伏：事與才爭，事繁而才損：放逸者流宕而忘歸，穿鑿者補綴而不足，時俗如此，安能獨違，但務去泰去甚爾：必有盛才重譽，改革體裁者，實吾所希。」李延壽北史文苑傳序云：「暨永明天監之際，太和天保之間，洛陽江左，文雅尤盛。彼此好尙，雅有異同。江左宮商發越，貴於淸綺；河朔詞義貞剛，重乎氣質。氣質則理勝其詞，淸綺則文過其意；理勝者便於時用，文華者宜於詠歌；此其南北詞人得失之大較也。若能接彼淸音，簡茲累句，各去所短，合其兩長，則文質彬彬，盡美盡善矣。」這形式內容並重的主張也隱然自樹一幟可以和上兩派相對抗的。這樣也可說是文人相輕的一種。</p>
<h3>爲了憎而愛</h3>
<p>— 龍貢公</p>
<p>從前，一個文學家底一篇論文裏面，有一個主要的論點說：「……世界上過去的和現存的所有的偉大文學家都是人道主義者。他們憎惡愚頑無知的羣衆，憎得越利害就愛得越利害，憎到無可再憎的時候就捨身去拯救他們……」其中最有趣味的口號是：「他們爲了愛而憎，爲了憎而愛！」原文已經記不淸楚，前面引用只是個大概，但那一句口號是無論如何不會忘掉的。</p>
<p>假如有一個才子愛一個佳人，佳人不睬他，那麽才子就憎她憎到入骨，這是純粹的「爲了愛而憎」，容易理解的。</p>
<p>但我不明白怎　「爲了憎而愛」——這是多麽難以想像的！後來讀「髙爾基的回憶瑣肥」這本書，才在「牧者」一篇中發現了一個勉强類似的人物。</p>
<p>牧者丁泰·博作夫是「一個靈魂圓滿的人。又聰明，又正直，又過着有節制的生活，爲人又很快活。六十多歲，身體還是肥壯，一個寬的胸口，一個銅色的面皮。」他是一個哲學家。他痛駡着敎育。</p>
<p>「爲什麽人類要分開各過各的生活呢？因爲敎育的關係。敎育把我和你隔着，阻止我們去相互理解。……大家把小孩兒叫到一個地方集會起來，在好幾年之間，敎他們一些煩惱。……怎樣能够對於一切的人都給以敎育呢？世上不會有這樣多的敎育！……知道守法：莫取不屬於你的物品，要留心你自己的財產，不要把飯吃光了，應該留一點給狗吃，要穿得暖暖和和的，要相信上帝——你看這就是好人知道的事。這就是好人頂需要的敎育。……受過敎育的人們，都是有瘋癲性的人，腦筋昏亂的人。」</p>
<p>他常常說這樣的話。斷定使人類當中發生毛病的東西，就是敎育；嘲笑地主底兒子彌嘉，戴着一副眼鏡，整天在捉蝴蝶，採集金龜蟲和草葉，預備寫一本關於蟲子生活的書（這位受過敎育的人還說蚊子會散布熱病，勸他留心）；因爲有一個敎員利用他敎員的地位，對孩子們說皇帝就是一切苦難的原因，他就駡敎員：「如果不是一個畜牲，就一定是一個蠢子。是一條牛」。</p>
<p>但是後來高爾基知道「這牧者有兩個無父無母的外甥，都在念書，並且還是牧者出的費用，一個在加山的獸醫學校，一個在烏拉第的中學校」，因而去質問他的時候，他就低聲說：</p>
<p>「我的外甥和我有血統關係。你只是一個外人，好像世人說的，一個過路的吿化子。所以我照着一切精神健全的人的辦法，爲我自己的利益而行動。我願意我的人受教育，却不願意別人去受……你懂得了吧？這就是……大家都這樣說：不管你願意不願意，親屬總還是親屬。所以我爲自己的親屬，利用我自己去幫他們。你難道相信，我不想看見他們變成些有體面的先生嗎？……」</p>
<p>這位丁泰·博作夫先生大概可以說楚憎敎育憎到極點，然後才愛上了，想去獨攬敎育的，倒有點像「爲了憎而愛」。</p>
<h3>青春</h3>
<p>— 李三郎</p>
<p>我的靑春是永遠沉寂地跟着流逝的光陰葬送了麽？</p>
<p>然而，這黑漆的旅途早就把我還未離開童年的純潔的心靈摧殘了呵。</p>
<p>白天，孤獨地帶着怱忙的調子尋求我那菲薄的養料；黃昏，街頭是那麽寒凉的我又帶了疲乏的身子歸來，在那老是一樣充滿了不幸的頹喪的氣味兒的小房子里，靜靜地沉思和寫習，從七點到午夜後兩點鐘，那麽有規律地消磨了凄凉的黑夜。這樣的時間最適宜工作的，我很少讓牠跟窗外的狂風吹送了呢。當那住在前樓的年輕的舞女帶了沉重的脚步歸來，便是午夜後的二點鐘。那幽怨的疏遠的都市的雄鷄在喔喔地啼着了，像催促我不該這樣挨着寒夜而摧殘了我的靑春一樣的</p>
<p>——是該要去睡的時候了。</p>
<p>然而，我躺在床上，沉重的腦袋那麽習慣了的會煽動了一幕一幕的思潮來——生活在靜穆的鄕村里的七八歲的小孩子時代，聽到這樣喔喔地啼着的聲音，天色還是迷矇地，鄉村里的人們都迅速地爬了起來等候那美麗的太陽東升了。後來，我遷到都市里，很少聽到鷄的啼聲了。現在，我却過着這麽畸形的生活——當鶴啼的時候我才去睡呵。</p>
<p>疲乏的身子，在狹小的布床上那曾跟我流浪了許久的結實的被窩里。想到人間萬樣的黑暗和悲憤，想到我該要怎麽堅决的向着偉大的光明之路上追求，想到我該要怎樣用筆頭描畫出那黑暗的圈子里過着痛苦的生活的人們。那時，我的腦袋刺激得很興奮，眞像瘋狂了的衝出黑夜去找尋我們所需要的一切來。漸漸地，昏量而顫抖地腌過了那快要天亮的短夜了。八點多鐘，都市的囂張的聲音又催醒我起床來，那麽不停地通着這一些乏味的日子呢。</p>
<p>然而，我需要那溫柔而嫩紅的早晨的太陽呵。我不願意這樣永遠地把靑春埋葬在沉寂的圈子里呵。</p>
<h3>村婦之夜</h3>
<p>— 丁郞</p>
<p>呱呱的聲音，</p>
<p>漾出破敗的棉絮；</p>
<p>想念着母親的乳液。</p>
<p>燈光潑在她的手上，</p>
<p>針線想捉住夜爬，</p>
<p>飛起了忙亂！</p>
<p>冷風潛進了門縫，</p>
<p>抖了一下光焰，</p>
<p>疲倦絞出了丈夫的鼾聲，</p>
<p>田墾榨了他的精神，</p>
<p>眼睛瞥了一下，</p>
<p>硬心又催着自己的辛勤！</p>
<h3>探病</h3>
<p>— 已而</p>
<p>明知道探望普通病房的病人，須下午三時才得進去，我每天總在二時半就趕到醫院去。我並不是有而性的人，站着空等在醫院門口，讓那麽悠長的三十分鐘，一秒一分的把我急煞，這我實在受不住。但我爲什麽要早去呢？我早去也是有因的。我覺得，我這樣在外面等雖則很焦急，可是在醫院裏第廿一號病室內，有一個病得十分沈重的病人，她在一天廿四時中，是比我更怎樣焦急地在等着下午三時的到來，而盼望着我去看她，給她一點安慰呵！而且，我在醫院門口站着等，也比在家裏坐着等，已好過得多了。因爲我早一點到醫院，從醫院外向裏面望進去，彷彿就像早一點看到她似的，心裏不覺輕鬆了不少。是故我每天極情願忍受這半點鐘的痛苦，不敢稍遲一些時刻去。</p>
<p>時間隨着地面上的日影一分一分地過去，探望病人的人也就陸續到來了。有的母親探望女兒，有的丈夫探望妻子，還有的朋友探望朋友。來探望的人，每人手裏總或多或少的帶來了幾樣食品，如小菜，餅干，果子，以及牛乳之類。這些人的心裏，各人苦樂不同。浮泛着憂愁臉孔的，一望而知他們所要探望的病人，病勢是很惡劣的。眉目間現露着歡悅神色的，無疑是他們的親人已經喜占勿藥了。至若幾個探望產婦的，大都樣子很高興。說不定他們有的在喜歡着做父親，有的在喜歡着做祖父或祖母呢</p>
<p>我每天到醫院去，也照例帶些東西，橘子，麵包和火腿。此外，我還帶着一顆沈重的心。我每日因爲到得早，就先將東西放在門房裏的桌子上，把兩隻手插在大衣的左右衣袋裏，一個人在門外踱來踱去。這時浮現出來的，無非是一些極可怕的陰影。眼前是她的灰白瘦削的顏容，耳畔是她的斷續悽苦的哀呌。不過不可靠的痴望也不是沒有的。或許吃了藥，她今天好了些了吧？或許打針了，她此刻已睡得很舒適？或許嘔吐北了，飯也吃得下了？然而在這許多「或許」之中，還有一個「或許」是很使我不敢想像的，那便是：或許她已不幸……　這樣地想念着，三點鐘終於到來了。大門一啟，站在門口的一羣人，就像潮水般衝了進未。我一踏入大門，心裏便悶亂起來，忐忑不自在。離病室越近，我的心也跳得越快。廿一號病房已在面前了，一氣走了進去，睜開慌張的眼睛，向躺在病牀上的病人望一望，開口第一聲便是：「今天可怎麼樣了？」這回答要是：「好了些了！」我的心就像放下了一塊鉛塊，立刻平靜了下去！倘然她挽着我的手，悲傷地嗚咽了起來，那我的心便如刀刺一般，霎時感到了一陳異樣的酸痛！</p>
<p>二點鐘的時間，一刹那便過去了，我們又得暫時分開了。我忍心地把這個病人放在寂靜的醫院裏，獨自走回家去。廿二時後的晤面，比一年還要遠久，眞不容易等呀！最呌我罣心不安的，是：明天她不曉得又要變成怎樣的一個狀態了？</p>
<h3>巨卿先生　（十）</h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>現在使他微微感得不滿的，倒是那一班很見得良莠不齊的髙足。嚴緊管束，原是巨卿先生唯一的敎育方針，目下這方針却漸漸有點不行了。從區立小學校轉過來的學生，是一例的頑皮，愛鬧，擅於搗亂，不受先生的管束：祗要巨卿先生離開書房一步，便會立刻發生糾紛，使他平添了許多煩擾。</p>
<p>這學風是應當整頓一下了，他想。</p>
<p>新來約學生當中，最皮頑强項的是沈慶中，這孩子，差不多每天的時間都化在淘氣的玩意當中，連安坐一刻的時間也幾乎沒有的。自從他來了以後，似乎許多學生都被他感化，變得不安靜起來了。殺一儆百，巨卿先生又决定整頓學風的事情從這孩子的頭上做起。</p>
<p>可是，巨卿先生得心應手地運用了二十年的嚴緊管理法，却在沈慶中身上失却了效用。</p>
<p>這孩子的刁頑好像是天生的，而且性情又勒得像牛皮膠。每一次當他犯規被發覺斗了來的時候，他就木瓜似的站在你的面前。無論你怎樣百般的結責，百般疾音厲色的呵斥，他總是咬緊牙關，一個死勁的不開口。等到你駡完了，他一廻身，却會立刻伸出舌頭，對同學們扳鬼臉。回到座位上，仍終偷偷摸摸地去幹他的頑皮勾當，甚至於責他跪在孔夫子脾位的面前，他也會涎着臉嘻喀地笑。</p>
<p>最後的一着，巨卿先生决定用他最大權威的體罰。</p>

<p>極大阻力　外交方面、我們的國家受到加重的壓迫、依然是論於次殖民地的地位、内政方面、土匪尙未完全消滅、使我們革命的力量爲之分散、而外國經濟的侵略、農村破產、工商業凋敝、更形成嚴重的經濟國難、我們的革命運動受到這種打擊、要怎樣打破這當前的難關、要怎樣解除這經濟國難、這就不得不靠我們每一個革命者運用我們的智識、來解决這個問題了、我們再就眼前事實來說、前面已經說過、中國革命的現階段、是訓政和建設、這種工作的成敗、是完全隨國民的智識程度爲轉移的、</p>
<p>中國文盲　據專家統計、佔全國人民總數百分之七十以上、這些文盲、連自己的姓名都不會寫、我們怎麽呌他們去行使四權、說到建設、近代的物質建設、事事要根據科學、而國內人才缺乏、技術專家、不能不借助外國、外國的專家、又往往不十分了解我國的國情、他們的計劃、未必就能適合我國的需要、從此我們可以得到一個敎訓、養成專門人才、提髙國民智識程度、是完成現階段的革命工作的先决條件、根據以上的分析、我們可以說讀書運動、是有極重大的意義、現在文化建設恊會所主持的、讀書運動、雞說是比較偏重於提倡髙深的學問、而不是普遍的掃除文盲運動、良以提倡髙深的學問、在當前建設時期、尤極關重要的、必須養成</p>
<p>多數幹才　與專家去從事建設工作、總理說、革命的基礎在乎高深的學問、就是這個意思、去年日本軍部發表一個小冊子、說未來之戰爭、爲國民全部之戰爭、兩國民衆之智能之戰爭、也是刺激人民從事於求知運動、我們爲提高文化水準、爲增進國民智識程度、爲提倡智識國防」不能不鼓勵國人讀害興趣、培養國民好學風氣、奬勵靑年潛心學術而發爲全國讀書運動、這是拯濟智識飢荒的運動、是培養國力換回國運的運動、至於婦除文富運動、在</p>
<p>中央方面　中央執行委員會有掃除文盲之三年計劃、在上海方面市政府設有民衆識字委員會、預計在一年之內、把上海全部文盲掃除、這種掃除文盲運動、目的是要把全國民衆智識水準提髙、以减少革命的阻力、這種全國上下一致推進、讀書運動、一天成功了、我們要談訓、要談建設、必然可以推行無阻、所以我們每個國民、應當極力贊助、極力擁護這種運動、兄弟最後敬祝文化建設協會讀書遝動成功、並希望全國國民努力推進讀書運動、</p>
<h3>市教局舉辦私塾登記　限月底一律調査完竣</h3>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （非邨）</p>
<p>祗有眞正地懂得達觀者的人，才有快樂；同時祇有眞正地能够應付環境的人，才有快樂。雖然你眼前的環境是多麽地惡劣，但是，你亦該要怎樣地來應付眼前的惡劣的環境才對。不然你鎭日間地感傷，哀嗚，苦悶，都中什麽用呢？</p>
<p>很多的人都在咒詛着現有的社會，甚至亦有怨恨着不幸生爲現在社會裏頭的人。這是多麼地錯誤哪！我們該知道，社會是什麽？我們更該明瞭，社會組織的構成是什麼？如果我們對於整個的社會有了深刻的理解，至少社會裏頭產生出來的罪過，該歸諸於我們自己的身上呀！（非邨）</p>
<h3>畬民</h3>
<p>— 史名</p>
<p>畬民，亦稱畬徭，原爲徭民的一支，相傳槃瓠遺種。他們的始視，是龍犬。這件神話，畬族中人人言之不。究屬他們的視先是誰，暫時找不到一點史實來打破傳說上的謬妄。不過可以斷定徭民由粤徙閩，由閩徙浙。</p>
<p>畬民共分十姓：初僅槃，藍，雷，鍾四姓，後添苟，婁，胡，侯四姓，近又新增林李兩族。其分佈於浙江處州舊府屬各縣者，內麗水遂昌爲最多，估計浙畬有二十萬人。其分佈於福建者，有古田，長汀等二十縣，人數不詳。此外，湖南，廣東和安徽陽源，亦有一部份的畬民。</p>
<p>他們的婚制是父系的，普通行一夫一妻制；五服內不通婚，婚姻由父母之命，媒的之言决定。不過他們男女絕對平權。喪制與漢人大同小異，惟亡人入斂，不舉哀，代以歌曲。昔日盛行火葬，近日漸採漢人士葬法。</p>
<p>畬民家庭中之組織分子，無論男女，均得同等享受財產永繼權。他們富於宗族觀念，大都聚族而居。在一同一個社會裏，有族長掌賞罰，就居住境內，立一公約，如有犯規，必經公議處罰，重則驅逐出境。可是他們信守心强，違背紀律，殆不多見。</p>
<p>畬民的個人與社會道德，長於漢人。可是漢人很賤視他們，於是對於畬民的敎育與地位，就有天大的分別，這一點希望當局注意一下。</p>
<h3>打瞌睡</h3>
<p>— 茸餘</p>
<p>打瞌睡雖是一件極平凡而極微細的事情，可是仔細地研究起來，倒也有一些小小的價植和興趣。</p>
<p>打瞌睡的成因，不外乎「疲乏」「困倦」「沒精神」；而其中又有「氣候」「體質「習慣」的區別：屬於氣候方面者，大致春夏較秋冬爲容易打瞌睡，所以古詩上有「春眠不覺曉」北窗高臥羲皇侶」「夏日炎炎正堪眠」的詩句。屬於體質方面者，肥人較瘦人容易打瞌睡，古人我不知道，單拿從前陝西督軍胡景翼而講，他身體是肥得異乎尋常，而打瞌睡的工夫，却亦非常人所能望其項背；他坐在室中，一邊和幕僚談天，一邊竟會鼾然睡着。屬於習慣方面者，大致懶惰的人和安逸的人，晚上雖睡眠得很足，日常瞌睡慣了，到了一定的時間，也會沉沉的睡着。此外屬於特殊情形者：如夜間少眠，…打牌喝酒，…日間也會打瞌睡；舟車擺動，也會使人閉了眼側着頭睡去。</p>
<p>打瞌睡到底不是一件好習慣，我在舟車中看了別人打瞌睡一副醜態，竟使我自己不敢去嘗試了。有些人頭隨着車一顚一簸的擺動，身子也在前後俯仰；有時一個不留心，竟會跌到地兒上，引得人哈哈大笑。有些人身子側着，軟癱着，倒在一個不相識人的身上，口涎流着寸許長，結果給人憎惡若而痛駡一頓。</p>
<p>「精神所至，金石爲開。」驅除這瞌睡蟲，用不着符咒，用不着醫藥，只要把精神振作起來，它自會退避三舍了。</p>
<h3>修復後才能講話</h3>
<p>— 涓隱</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十一回　夜話凄凉生涯原是夢履痕零亂風雨太欺人</p>
<p>現　在是白天的上午，大家都有朝氣，昨晚上廻腸盪氣，那些凄凉纒綿的事，大概全忘了，大家又計議到朱月英姑娘身上去了。天上的雨絲，老是不停的向下落着，隔了玻璃窗子外的檐溜，牽若粗繩子也似，垂到地下，始終不斷。便是玻璃上，也讓水點打着，起了無數的浪紋。玻璃上層的水，兀自一行行的向下流着。賈多才皺了眉道：在西安這地方，本來也就枯燥得要命。再加上下雨，大門是一步也不能出。這樣長天日子，怎麽混？李士廉道：你忙什麽？不就要去說媒了嗎？賈多才笑道：你這話可有些不通。作媒也不過是一種希望，有什麽法子可以調劑煩悶。浣花瞅了他一眼，笑道：總可以的，沒什麽難……在他說完了這八個字之後，立刻想到自己說的話，太含混，不覺紅了臉道，李先生，你不用笑，我的話沒有說完。我想着我去找那姑娘來，一定可以辦到的。賈先生，你去呌幾個菜，來點酒，吃得我髙髙興興的去說媒，好不好？而且，這也是作媒的人應當要求的。賈多才聽說，這就述聲說好笑着，就去拿桌上的紙筆，便有要開菜單子的意思。李士廉搖手道：不忙，讓楊小姐去把朱小姐請來了，大家坐在一塊兒痛飲幾杯，那不是更好嗎？浣花突然站起來笑道：好的，我就去。我知道，他們家就在這後頭。一個鐘頭之內，我準回來。你們看看我的。說着，用手指了自己的鼻子尖，然後笑嘻嘻的走出來了。（一七六）</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>保管這些鳳履的屋子，也是一間極大的偏殿，四面的墻壁上，從天花板起到地下，全用木板格成了許多的木匣子，一行行的無慮數百。每一雙鳳履佔着一個匣子，外面又依次編着號碼。另外有一本很厚的簿子，簿上也記着同樣的號碼，且在每個號碼之下，註明白這雙鳳履的式樣，顏色，花紋等等；這一本簿子，就存在一個專給太后繕寫文件的女官那裏。待到太后忽然髙興想換一雙鳳履了，便敎這個女官把那簿子送上去，讓伊自己慢慢地翻看；看定了，只須說出一個號碼來，便立刻可以派人去把伊所選中的那一雙新鞋子取來了。如今說起來，也好算得是一種適合於時間經濟原則的科學管理法了！</p>
<p>這兩個專門保管鳳履的太監，當然不能就算是製鞋業的藝工，只好算是宮中的執事人員之一。所謂製鞋業的藝工是另有一班人，伊們也都是女性，却並不作爲宮婢，一樣可以自由進退的。伊們所擔任的工作確然也是一項專門技術，决非毫無訓練的普通人所能勝任的，但也並不如何勞苦；以我處於旁觀者的地位看起來，正和宮中其他各業藝工所任的工作一般的好玩，一般的有趣。伊們的中間，還有兩個負着管理責任的領袖，那是兩個約模五十多歲的老婦人。——實在不是老婦人，而是老處女；伊們都在很年輕的時候，就被雇用到這宮來的。（二八七）</p>
<h3>怪姓再續</h3>
<p>— 椀公</p>
<p>作者上次在本欄登過一篇「怪姓錄」，後來有一位公民言先生，來一個績錄；內中搜羅的怪姓很多，而且很幽默；不要說別的；就是公民言先生的貴姓，也就够怪的了。當這種「國家事管他娘」的時候，與其去「打打麻將」，倒不如研究研究這個，反很有趣！所以我不憚煩地，再來一個，並且希望「秉春秋之筆」的瘦鵑先生，給我們一點方便，假一角之地，讓大家夥一齊來搜集一下，或者可以編成一部「百家姓」續編。我現在補充的有五個：（太）從前在韶關講武堂，有一位同學姓太名芬，是雲南人，據他自己說是太姒之後。（但）前年在六安做事，遇見一位但西坪先生，他是安徽敎育界的聞人。（尢）不是「朱秦尤許」的尤，它比尤字少一點，音汪，是字典中一個部首。白克路有一位尢彭熙醫生。（忻）新近由杭州來了一位忻壹大律師，曾在報紙上，大登開業的廣告。他的姓名都很怪。（蕢）上海有一位聞人，蕢延芳先生，這個姓：外處也很少見。還有（仿）（樓）（初）（庶）（帝）幾姓，我都看見過，但是一時舉不出他們的大名了。</p>
<h3>桃李刦</h3>
<p>— （俠虎）</p>
<p>吾澉南北湖，環山桃李，花開時，紅霞白雪，相映成趣；斯湖以桃花著名，直可名爲桃花湖也。往歲春時，遊人絡繹，湖旁鄉農，導客遊覽，稍有進益。本年遊客寥落，而薄命桃花，復遭風霧霜雪之厄，未開先落，過其地者，祗見滿目荒凉，民有菜色耳。據農云：百花經霜，收成失望！去年旱災，農民渴望今春蠶豆及花果豐收，以稍稍恢復已傷之元氣。今桃李遭刦，百花早凋，行見民困更甚矣。</p>

<h3>求乞藝術</h3>
<p>— 黄影呆</p>
<p>身懷十二金鎊</p>
<p>在倫敦或英國其他的重要都市之中，流浪的人們和有藝術手腕的乞丐，有時也能很幸運的聚有好多財產·最近有一個乞丐，因爲他的身上，有十二鎊的金錢，而在倫敦市的西面向人求乞；所以被警察拘了去，判罰拘禁三個月。這個乞丐，在法庭上，訴說他非常的貧困，差不多要難以生活了，所以做這求乞的勾當。可是後來被法官在他身上發現了有十二鎊的財產，便罰他監禁三月，並提出五鎊作坐監時的生活費。</p>
<p>死後舉行宴會</p>
<p>威廉司蒂文遜，是著名的「蘇格蘭的乞丐之王。」他在臨死時，書一遺囑，要舉行一次盛大的宴會，宴請所有的有求乞藝術的乞丐，而使他們在他陳屍待殮的時候，都來一親遺容，那麼他死也瞑目了。這個盛大的宴會，說來眞非常的驚人，一共租借了三間倉屋，宰羊三十頭，以作宴客的菜餚。另外飲料方面，啤酒吃掉不知其數，而最上等的威士忌酒，又有八加侖之多。可知這個宴會，化去了不少的錢呢！</p>
<p>三千鎊的遺產</p>
<p>査阿龍，這個可憐的人是倫敦著名的乞丐。他的臉上，裝着一條很長的假鬚，一般的人都知道他五十年不知道睡在牀上的樂趣了，換句話說，便是每天睡在地上。可是他逝世而後，却留下遺產三千鎊。</p>
<p>兒子是大學生</p>
<p>可是這裏更有一個求乞手腕很高妙的乞丐，呌特姆弗蘭斯。他把求乞得來的錢，送他的兒子進愛丁保大學讀書。他的求乞方法，手裏拿了兩隻口袋，在路上如果有一位仁人君子把一個錢幣投入他的一隻口袋裏，他會使另外一個注意而同樣的施捨，更會說「我的兒子在大學裏念書，請帮他一些學費！」兒子在大學裏，父親求乞而供給他的學費，也是一件很有趣的事情吧？人們聽見了不消他求乞，也會樂於解囊。後來這個靑年，曾一度入閣，而老死的時候，年紀也已不小，在英國至今把這件事傳爲佳話。</p>
<p>捐贈鉅額遺產</p>
<p>巴奈奥夫寗是一個有名的愛爾蘭乞丐，他畢生求乞到二，五零零金鎊。曾寫一遺囑，說明死後要將此鉅欵資助一般親友中的貧困者，但有一位牧師勸他捐給羅馬某慈善機關，他便聽了牧師的話，全數捐去。後來敎會方面，時常說起這乞丐的偉舉，所謂雖死猶榮，實可當之無愧。</p>

<p>昨華商證劵交易所、春節假滿、照常開市、環境上雖無重大變化、而英鎊借欵空氣愈濃、九六公債傳聞金融界有要求整理之說、因之檯面逐步趨緊、新多頭漸有下手、惟空方則尙多掙扎、抵補亦稀、昨日形勢、九六於午前、堅穩微高、午後進戶漸衆、因賣戶太少、多數未能足胃、今日或有一番盛况也、其他各種債券、則因外債有希望、檯面亦係求過於供、空方稍有掉期、大都堅　微髙、三十二·三十四及四十三號等、均有買進、十四及十七號稍有賣出、綜計市價結果、九六獨漲七角至八角半、因其底價甚低、投機者較易入手、其他亦一致微好、計漲一角至角三不等、成交總數、共計一千一百九十六萬六千元、茲將其漲跌結果、列比較表於左、（單位元成交單位百元）</p>

<h3>紗花　期貨休假聲中　紗銷尙可標花細狹</h3>
<p>紗棉紗市情尙屬穩靜、因有一部份廠方業已缺乏現貨供給、對於粗紗、且竟欲分派出貨、人心尙佳、市價仍能鞏固、在此停市兩天中、客帮現紗交易、尙可維持、但各方進胃、未見十分暢健、期紗仍因春假停市、客帮買去現紗統計三百十五包、行情平平、六日成交一百三十五包、五日補成交四百四十五包、茲將本日成交之各帮口及包額錄下、</p>
<p>江西　五〇　廣東　二五　內地　五</p>
<p>長沙　一五　河南　五一　福建　五</p>
<p>汕頭　四〇　蕪湖　二五　同行　五</p>
<p>花　市平淡之局、海外美印棉價雄微漲、然銀價上升、金市下落、滙兌放長、採算價尙平、兼之各地存棉太厚、棉價之壓力、一時不易消除、現棉廠方進量仍狹小、在此兩天期棉停市中、各廠購辦、未曾發表、</p>
<h3>糧食　洋客秈逐步上展　厚粳盤起角許</h3>
<p>（滬南）昨各帮來源仍祗二十餘號、（貨共近四千石）銷塲以天雨平常、惟連日到稀、人心較可、各厚粳巳喊起角許、晚稻市以包胃祗威海衛帮辦二百餘包、市色似較厚粳略遜、僅稍升數分耳、杜尖及陰變兀等悉無甚上落、　（滬北）昨天宮陰雨連綿、河下各路來源、祇有十二三號、市上各貨去胃淸淡、市價白粳緊起數分、早稻價加一角、其餘各貨、較前彷彿、</p>
<p>（洋米）昨日洋米初居平正、因連日上漲後、進戶或有嫌大觀望、漲風似已回定、惟昨日本街辦胃又貪、在市收羅客秈外、對於高洋米辦胃甚香、內地帮續又辦裝中次各米、故市價又見各漲五六分、客秈由本街內地爭辦、存底逐枯、來源早絕、故市面更形緊俏也、全日開出西貢小絞暹邏各米達二萬左右、期貨有回籠西貢三百噸、客秈開二千包、</p>
<h3>遠期粉麥爲雨帶高</h3>
<p>麵粉　昨日粉市、上午開市後洋麥升降不一、惟現粉枯乏如故、而實銷去胃不絕、昨日北洋又有近遠各月份之收買、且以天氣陰雨有損麥苗、故業內外囤戶進胃甚濃、大小各廠一律擯不拋出、空頭心思搖動亟亟求補、故開價即大、午後步砌、收市價本月大七厘半、下月大一分七五、六月大三分、七至九月各大三分二五、</p>
<p>小麥　昨日麥市、午前各盤中、市面均居平定之局、因了結與補空兩平、各方均少競爭、午後有業外團戶爭辦遠期、蓋邇日天雨、麥苗有損、人心乃多向上看、遠月爲新麥標準、更見緊俏、收市七八月份各大四五分、近期反以了結小一分、但現麥甚缺、廠胃亦佳、昨開五千包、由福阜兩大廠辦去、髙車麥三元八角二分至三元八角、次至三元七角云、</p>
<h3>美麥前途觀察</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告美麥情况云、冬麥現入於春季之生長月份、迄今水份之不足、至爲顯著、西南硬冬麥帶尤有大旱之虞、目下預測麥作物之歉收、雖爲時尙早、但冬麥進入春季狀况之欠佳、則實無可諱言也、</p>
<p>近年來美國國內之供給激减、一九三五年七月本屆之作物年開始時、美國小麥之積存將降至所謂「統計常態或平安積存」之水準、故本年而再歉收、則或將發生嚴重之結果、現在之供給顯未過重、設欲於此大量榨取、則勢必有輸入麵包小麥之必要、茲將美國國內供給之狀况列之如左、</p>
<p>國內供給（單位一百萬斛）</p>
<p>作物年　七月一日　出　產</p>
<p>之積存　冬麥　春麥　供給總數　消費六月卅日積存</p>
<p>一九三一－三二　三二四　八一八　一一四　一，二五六　八七四　三八二</p>
<p>一九三二－三三　三八二　四七六　二六八　一，一二六　七四〇　三八六</p>

<p>一九三四－三五　二九一　四〇一　九六　七八八　×六五五　×一三三</p>
<p>×係估計之數</p>
<p>子午綫一百度以西大平原之作物生產、完全受水份之限制、夏末與秋季之充份雨量、乃土壤水份供給之來源、當小麥生長最活潑而爾水不足以供其需要之時、麥苗即吸收此種水份而賴以生長、故次層土壞水份之大量積儲、其與麥作物之關係、亦猶人之與銀行中之存欵也、査美國硬冬麥帶於去年七月至九月底中之雨量、積儲極小、</p>
<p>冬麥之種植、係自九月中旬起、一直至十一月中止、在此期內、苟有大量雨水、則種仔得賴以發芽、而苗亦得賴以樹立、根固之苗、其抵抗冬日之嚴寒與風吹與夫土壤變動之力量、自較不固者爲强、自去年十月三日至今年二月二十六日、西方小麥生長之區、未受有通常之水份供給、實則西南之大部份之雨水、較之往年此期中猶不及百分之五十、最近大風沙之報吿迭傳、可見至今仍缺乏適當之水份、</p>
<p>東方冬麥帶之狀况大體上雖尙能滿意、但西區之情形、則頗不同、該處因次層土壤之缺少水份、故將來收成之命運、將全視從今至收獲時之天氣而定、如欲豐登、則雨水必須普遍而有極佳之分配、據農業部職員之推測、西方大平原之冬麥、如欲得平均之收穫、則今後至收穫時之水份、須較常時多百分之一百二十一、並謂此種機會、祇有二成之把握云、</p>
<p>現今討論春麥之展望、雖爲時尙早、但吾人須指出者、即大都份之春麥區亦感缺乏適當之雨水、致次層土壤之水份、必較平均爲低、</p>
<p>如欲出產達到平均之程度、則此後數月內之雨量必須較通常爲多、且宜有及時之分配、去年之亢早、猶歷歷如在目前、而本屆小麥之供給、匪維逐步减少、且本年之收成、又將受確定之威脅、設短期內情形而仍無進境、則此後數月中時時發生作物恐慌之禍根、業巳種下矣、</p>

<h3>絲茶　華茶美銷逐步衰退</h3>
<p>華茶對美貿易、向居重要地位、年來因受日茶競銷影響、紅綠茶輸入美國之數、巳由三十餘萬箱、减至七八萬箱、近據洋行家傳出消息、現下日本豪灣兩路紅綠茶、競銷尤厲、美政府因受日商宣傳之故、對於華茶入口、異常岐視、所定標準、未能與爪哇日本各國茶同等待遇、如茶箱破碎、茶身着色、以及含有烟味者、均將禁止入口、</p>

<p>又公會划盤髙粗砂白呌十七元半、未成交、傳口貨五元六角、稍有划出、比前（六日）升角昨、</p>
<h3>五金　竹節鋼條走勢獨盛</h3>
<p>昨日天雨、五金實交因輸運不便、大爲减色、惟竹節鋼條、緣建築帮需用浩繫、成交達二百數十噸之多、惟因銀根緊急、四月底長期到期關係、廉價脫手者大有人在、標準價即節下降、最近扯價祇估一百〇三四元光景、而最廉花色祗估九十八元、聞靑島徐州浦口諸帮最近均有採辦之訊、而海外定價、近來已有轉鬆氣象、是以本埠同業對於定貨生意、近來亦有蓬勃之趨勢也</p>

<h3>這樣的墮胎罪惡嗎？</h3>
<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>看四日三報社會新聞，很觸目的讀到了這樣的一節：鎮江沈陳氏，在本埠某日僑家爲傭，近因懷孕已三月，生怕日後腹部逐膨脹，工作不便，或有被主人辭退之虞，故爲防失業計，乃私以葡萄乾一條，塞入下體墮胎，後事發，被法院以墮胎罪，判決徒刑二　年准予緩刑云。</p>
<p>當我唸完了這一段記事，心上不禁一跳，覺得生計迫人，真是可怕。這位少婦，要是有福氣，嫁給一個有錢人，現今一懷了孕，自己不曉得要怎樣歡喜。說不定將來生一個小寳寳，夫婦間旣添上了一個慰藉品，堂上的翁姑，亦必笑逐顏開，倍加疼惜她。然而她不幸，因家中窮苦，不得不到外面來做娘姨，用自己的勞力，去換幾個錢來維持生活。出賣勞力不打緊，而今却連腹中的一塊肉，也不能不因生活的驅壓，忍痛把他墮出來。生命雖邀天之佑保得住，却還逃不了二年的罪刑。其處境的悲慘，實屬可憫。</p>
<p>墮胎的行爲，從人道上說，是殘忍，從法律上說，是罪惡。可是人道和法律，有時是敵不過生活的鞭策的。世間正有不少窮人，常在暗地裏幹起這種殘忍而且罪惡的勾當。</p>
<h3>胡老頭</h3>
<p>— 華木</p>
<p>傍晚時候，胡老頭沒精打彩的從艙裏鑽出來、河上，平平靜靜的，洒着軟軟的陽光。仰頭望了一下天邊的雲彩，心裏像塞了一塊石頭，沉滯滯的。無聊地摸着下巴鐵釘似的鬍髭，把頭茫茫的搖搖兩下，像說：一天又完啦。</p>
<p>蹌踉地爬上岸。山後沉雷似地有汽車輾過泥路的聲嚮，濛濛的衝起一陣黄塵。可很作怪，這陣黃塵就像從大蟒口裏吐出來的，漫天滾地的向他捲來，不由不呌胡老頭寒心。「完啦，這劃老骨頭！』深深的唉了口氣，拐進碼頭右邊的小酒店來了。</p>
<p>店堂內冷冷淸淸的，燉酒爐有烟沒氣的楞在一邊。胡老頭一着到這麽芝落的光景，心頭又一陣難過，彷彿是一股壓　，一般揶揄。口裏喝着濃烈的酒，腦子一邊就淸淸楚楚的翻着舊事。</p>
<p>他記得自己二十多歲開始走墟船。這個角塘碼頭一到臨晚就熱熱鬧鬧的，河岸下一列過去，船頭咬船尾的靠攏着肚子載得沉甸甸的船。船一停篙，同夥們就在河裏抹了臉，摸上乾凈褂子，三五一幫的爬上岸來，一夥兒全是無憂無慮的啦。現在可就變了，自從山後開了一條公路，徹日子奔馳着怪物似的大汽車，泥塵捲起半空高，天天載着滿車的墟客，滿車的客貨，不到半個月，這塊角塘碼頭就一下子變或了火燒後的荒地一般，荒荒凉凉的，五間酒店關了四家，剩下現在的一家也有氣沒力的殘喘着氣。胡老頭的船就在這個時侯斷了行，寒傖傖的靠在碼頭偏左的榕樹下乾喝着河水……。</p>
<p>這無可挽救的致命的打擊，胡老頭可不糊塗，他明白，這是山後一條公路作的怪，搶走了他的飯碗。所以他一聽到車聲，看到黄塵，心頭就行寒噤？</p>
<p>—完啦。這副老頭骨！</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>日子，在絕望中滑過去，生活與憂愁打成兩支燒紅的鐵針，猛猛的貫穿着胡老頭的心，幾次就想索性死了這條走墟船的心，把船乾脆賣掉，回老家種田，啜口稀粥，把日子混完就拉倒啦。但是這個念頭可時時都會變成水泡，很快的漲起，又一下子揑下，心又不由不軟了下來。一家六口子，僅有五祖穀額的旱水田，假使不是靠着這條船，老早就餓死了，還能捱到今天？一想到這個艱難關頭，胡老頭就把酒碗擱在嘴唇上，痴痴的望着平平靜靜流着的河水，像用着全身勁力要抓住浮在水面上的什麽似的。……</p>
<p>太陽沒了。河上，山上，漸漸的扯下模糊的夜影。故老頭喉嚨酸酸的喝完一碗酒。</p>
<p>日子跟着河水靜靜地滑過去，一天，兩天……角塘碼頭的榕樹下空空洞洞的，不見了胡老頭的船。</p>
<h3>孩子之死</h3>
<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>琳近來已有點兒變態：幾天來不曾照過鏡子，整理她的蓬鬆的像亂麻般的頭髮；臉孔上也不塗上粉和胭脂，黃得像蜡般的怕人！整天的躺在床上，背若人流眼淚，把枕頭也都弄得潮膩膩了。</p>
<p>仁也無精打彩地背着手在房間裏來回地踱方步，臉孔一點光澤也沒有，像蒙一層灰塵，又像夜裏沒有睏足覺的失眠者。他時時停住脚步站在床前，瞧着躺在床上的琳的肩膀迅速的聳動，聽着她的喉頭發出來的絲微的抽　。他坐下去，輕輕地撫摸她的蓬亂的頭髮，嘟囔着——</p>
<p>「琳，心裏不好過嗎？……親愛的，就把她看做沒有這回事就是了，不要傷心吧！……其實，活在世上也是受苦頭，咱們的肚子裏遠裝不飽，那有……；」仁的喉頭也嘶啞了，聲音低微得有些顫動。</p>
<p>琳更加有勁嗚嗚地哭出聲音來，兩隻肩膀急速地跳着，全身也隱約地在顫抖着。</p>
<p>家庭裏少了一個小孩子，空氣確是格外的死寂靜穆！小琳祇死去三四天，房間裏就靜穆的像深山裏的古寺。一切都是黯淡的，沒有一點兒生氣。</p>
<p>在平時，仁從外面回歸家裏來，琳抱着小琳嘻皮笑臉地迎上前去：「小琳，呌呌爸爸，爸爸買糖菓來給你。」於是，小琳就伸出小手來要糖菜，嘴裏呌着簡單的聲音。那時，仁也快活極了，從琳的手裏把小孩子抱過來，跟她逗一回笑，呀呀的敎她學語，他忘掉了身上所荷負着的重担，忘掉了在外面所遭受着的閑氣和恥辱，他把一切的痛苦都忘掉得乾乾掙凈了，他覺得家庭裏的空氣是暖和的，樂洋洋的。</p>
<p>「可是小琳已經死去了。」他想：腦袋像鐘擺似的搖蕩着。</p>
<p>然而，爲了要使琳不要過度的悲傷，他又不得不裝起笑臉來，平心靜氣地安慰她——</p>
<p>「琳，把這件事情看開未，起來吧！咱們一同到外面去吃飯，然後，再找一個好玩的地方去逛逛。……咱們的年紀還靑哩，以後說不定還要養他出來三個五個。……」</p>
<p>琳還是不肯起來，依舊地抽咽着。</p>
<p>終於，仁又站起來了，低沉着腦袋，背着手，拖着沉重的脚，慢條斯理地在床前來回地踱着，心裏悶得慌！</p>
<p>他想起小琳的肥嫩的臉龐，靈活的黑眼珠子，天一亮就從床上翻起來，剝着他的眼皮，撫摸琳的頭髮，呀呀的爸呀媽呀的呌喊着。</p>
<p>「這活潑潑的小生命，怎麽會這樣快就萎謝呢？……」心裏暗暗地這樣想看。同時，一陣慚愧從他的肚子裏滾上來，悶着他的心臟，使他疼痛得站立不穩，眼前的一切都在急速地旋轉了。他發瘋似的呢喃着：</p>
<p>「我眞的沒有做爸的資格了，對小孩子太不負起責任！小琳祗胃了一點兒風寒，就沒有錢給她請醫生，讓她躺在床上，靜靜地死去了！」他氣憤憤地把兩手緊揪着他頭上的頭髮，簡直發了瘋了，一歪一斜踉蹌地踱到床上，撲在琳的懷裏，跟着琳哇哇的盡情地哭着。……</p>

<h3>齊格飛所認爲醜陋的在電影界却成了明星（上）</h3>
<p>— 新尼</p>
<p>弗洛侖斯齊格飛（Flrenz　Ziegfeld）在他死後，曾被歌舞界上了一個尊號，稱他爲偉大的齊格飛（The　Great　Ziegfeld），并且爲他製成了一張影片，表揚他一生的事蹟。爲的是什麼？都是爲了他一生致力於美的提倡。他終身做的是，完美的　等等。他是百老匯的齊林尼（意大利名雕刻家（Cellini）不過他所工作的，是女子的形態，而齊林尼工作的，是金屬而已。</p>
<p>齊格飛的歌舞團，在美國已變斐聲了幾十年了，從其中出來而進入影界之中的美女子，亦一時便　僕難數。我們略爲舉出幾位有名的，譬如麗蓮泰許門（已死），別莉杜六十，陶樂茜凱淾，茂琳黛維絲梅茂蘭等等，都是偉大的齊格飛一手提拔出來的。</p>
<p>但是倘使齊格飛看見了現在斐聲於影界的葛雷泰嘉賓，或是凱絲琳赫本，或是珍妮蓋諾，或是瓊克勞馥，或是海倫漢斯以及安娜史丹等等，他會選她們進他的歌舞團嗎？這是無論誰都知道萬萬不合的他一定要呌他的助手，納德韋朋或仇林米乞淾，趕緊他們出去。至於爲什麼，那還要等他脾氣好的時候，或者會和你談一談，但是齊格飛的脾氣，平常是很暴烈，不大肯談論他的所以然的。</p>
<p>但是在齊格飛的心目中，葛雷泰嘉賓到底是個什麼樣子的人。他一定說她的嘴向着這面，而眼睛是向着那面的。他亦會說她的不頗生得太高，而鼻子生得太低了。他或者說她的眼眶陷得太深，而上唇太向下墮了。這些都是美術家的話，亦就是齊格飛的話。但是不管如何，葛雷泰嘉賓在銀幕，却是一個別具風味的美人。</p>
<p>倘使凱絲琳赫本跑到齊格飛那裏去求事做，齊格飛看了她一眼就會說：「不與，不與，」而攆她走的。倘使凱絲琳一定要知道爲什麼，而齊格飛肯和她談一兩分鐘的話，他會告訴她，她的顴骨太高了，她的顴骨太長了，她的面容全部，太像原始時代的人了：簡捷的說，她的面是個馬面。但是凱絲琳在銀幕上，還不失其美，而她的美的特點，却就是建築在她的缺點上的。</p>
<p>齊格飛一生的事業，就是拿着繩尺去量美人。他將完善的美人，在尺寸成立了一個不可變易的標準。譬如說：「身長一定要五尺五寸（英人），胸圍三十四寸，腰圍二十六寸，臀圍三十七寸，小腿十三寸半，肩圍十五寸，頸至腰十五寸，頸長二寸半，臂長二十七寸等等。但是……</p>
<p>我們不甚去窺伺各大明星化妝室中的秘密，但是很明顯的事實，她們很少能合乎齊格飛美的尺寸的。譬如說，將葛雷泰嘉賓比起珍妮蓋諾來，嘉賓比蓋諾，竟高了六寸之多，蓋諾體重比嘉賓少了二十六磅。兩個人都不合乎美的標準，但是兩個人都在銀幕上佔着至高的地位，各不相礙的並存着。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評評</p>
<h3>「鐵腕慈心」</h3>
<p>— 兆仁</p>
<p>Father　Brown　Detective　—國泰映</p>
<p>大約在一個多月以前，我曾經看過一部影片，題名已經忘記了，只記得故事是寫一個成名了的戲劇家，當海船失事的時侯，他是勇敢的救了幾個婦人的性命。被救的婦人自然非常威激，但以爲他巳經身死，回家後便在他的戲院門口樹立銅像，藉以紀念他。於是他的妻兒子女，也都以爲他已死去，十分悲痛。誰知他在危難之中，却怯懦的穿了女人的衣裳逃難，雖然保全了性命，卻覺得是無限的恥辱。尤其因着人們譽他爲英雄，更使他不好意思回家，只好改名換姓的流浪着。十餘年之後，他爲了想念妻子，偸偸的回到家裏，但不敢和妻相見，悄悄的帮助不認識的兒子在戲劇上的成功，最後到底和妻見了一面，又開始去度着漂泊的生活。</p>
<p>在這個戲中，有着濃重的傷感，沉厚的人情世味，給與我很大的感動。而主演者華說康諾勒（WelterConnolly）的演技，也有着極大的成功。同爲如此，我對於這一演員很注意。但是他這次主演的「鐡腕慈心」，我却不放讚美了。</p>
<p>首先我就不喜歡這種故事，使宗敎和政治合一，以宗敎的感化力使罪犯改過行善，這空虛的說敎，作爲劇的主題，在二十世紀的科學昌明的時代，劇作者如此處理作品，無論如何總非智者所爲吧？誰也不會忽視劇作者的用心，他將電影藝術作爲政治的輔助，這對於爲政者自然是有利的了。但是人們更不會忽視盜賊的行爲，正是社會的罪惡。人們不能從本質上去指出社會的病態，進而啟發觀衆改造社會，而祗是苦心孤詣的去維護崩潰中的社會存在，也不過是勞而無功罷了，事實上美國的罪犯並不會因宗敎的說敎而消滅或者是減少的。</p>
<p>卽就表現技術來說，也並不能鮮明的傳達劇的主題與劇作者的用心。相反的爲了過於誇大了神父勃郞（FatherBrown）own）的聖潔，使人們以爲他祗是神話中的虛疑人物。而有不眞實之威或，當然，這裏也不是全無成功的表現，譬如一整個的戲能够在恬靜的空氣中進行，莊嚴肅穆的情調在影片中充溢着，對於個別的心理描寫的塲合，如少女之叔父擔心着失竊的時候，也處理得較好，但是整個的說來，大部份可以說是沒有成功的。而主演者華爾脫康諾納的演技，也並不能表現他的優秀。</p>
<p>不過我又覺得，在這一影片中，如果僅在技術上來指出失敗與否，乃是多餘的事。因爲庸俗的內容也祇能有庸俗的表現而已。</p>
<h3>在未得名前瓊克勞馥的一個故事</h3>
<p>— 國城</p>
<p>下面所述是瓊克勞馥尙未在銀幕上成名以前的一段關於她加入歌舞的故事。</p>
<p>瓊克勞馥在中學校的時候，她是一個很會討人歡喜的小姑娘，在全體同學中，她也是一個以善於舞蹈出名的。當她每次想起她未來的時候，她就聯想到關於歌舞的事情上面；這是因爲歌舞給她的興味太深了。有一天，她忽然堅毅地下了决心，就在第二天離開學校，跑到Kanas城中她母親的身邊，預備找一件工作。她要做工的主旨，是爲了要積些銀錢，好去參加歌舞的事業。</p>
<p>於是她在一家店舖裏做了店員，她一面積蓄錢財，一面又把這錢去置備一點新衣服。後來她聽到了，西部地方有一個劇塲經理正在招慕少女做臨時歌舞演員的消息，她就立刻跑去應徵，原來那就是Spriugfield的一個歌舞演技團。當她到達了Spriegridld時，她換了一個假名叫做Lucilke　Le　Sueur，這個姓名本是她母親在處女時代的姓名。</p>
<p>但這一次她參加到這個歌舞團裏，只有一個很短的時期，她僅僅被任用了兩個星期。她所得到的酬金，也只够她回到Kansas城去。然而這兩個星期的生活，却增强了她所要參加那種事業的興味。</p>
<p>以後，她覺得在Kansas城中似乎是沒有希望，她便乘火車到支加哥去了。她所帶去的只有兩個銀元，和一個髙度的希望。她四處尋找一個歌舞社社員的位置，可是在這個異鄕的城市中，却是很不容易的。最後她跑ErnieYung那裏去，因爲她曾聽到有人說過ErnieYoung是一個戲院的主人。</p>
<p>這是奇怪而又凑巧的事情，就在這一天，「支加哥咖啡館」正要舉行一個盛大的歌唱會，ErnieYoung允許在這個歌唱會裏給她一個臨時加入的位置。</p>
<p>以後的八個星期中，她是由不被人注意的第三排而擢升到第一排的邊尾上了，（這是指唱歌班的排列，唱得好的人站在第一排），雖然這時候她仍沒有正式被任川。</p>
<p>那天的晚上，戲院裏排演一齣新的歌舞喜劇「InnocentEyes」，瓊克勞馥也跳着舞，表現普一種很新穎的風味和姿式，戲院主人這時看見了，才答應給她一個正式任用的位置。</p>
<p>她的位置是被分配在「Ponies」的那一羣流裏，這裏許多年輕的少女都待她很和愛，她們幫着她化裝打扮，敎導她以許多新的舞蹈步法。瓊克勞馥從此就漸漸地發展起來了。</p>
<h3>龔稼農肇禍入獄</h3>
<p>老婆兒龔稼農，是一個性情剛直的男子，近來他鍾情了鄕女阿萱，相憐相愛，巳儼若夫婦了。不料阿萱進了一家時裝公司充當女工，被打樣師王南文看上了，要他在時裝表演會裏做表演員，一方面王南人又對她拚命的追求，使一個剛剛初涉足社會的鄕女，不禁神魂瓢蕩起來。當時裝表演會舉行的前一晚，各報競載阿萱妖艷裝束的照片，老婆兒一見，怒髮衝冠，憤恨萬分，當時警吿阿萱，呌她不要去參加，無奈阿萱不聽。於是第二天時裝表演會開幕，當阿萱登塲時，稼農就猛然闖入，將阿萱所穿的時裝，扯得粉碎，打樣師王南文也被打傷。這樣一來，他就不得不被逮入獄了。——自然，以上所說的事出有因，査無實據，不過是「落花時節」中的一毆劇情。</p>
<p>電影小說</p>
<h3>業餘記者　（After　Office　Hours）（五）</h3>
<p>— 彤雲</p>
<p>雪倫格格的笑着道：「讓他們去好了。他們肚子餓了，會自己出來的。」但是傑姆不聽，他跪在地上尋找着。一回兒雪倫亦跪下來了。他們都爬到沙發底下尋找水菓。忽然電話　」，雪倫爬了起來，去接電話，原來那是傑姆的電話。傑姆接完了電話，吿訴雪倫道：「明天晚上，又是河邊總會開幕的第一晚。那裏一定很熱閙得很。我們明天在那裏吃晚飯。」倫很疑惑的，看了傑姆的臉問道：「這算是請我呢，還是派我的工作呢？」傑姆想了一想道：「這是派你的工作。」一回兒那各脫夫人拿了咖啡進來，他們喝了一回咖啡就散了。</p>
<p>到了明天晚上，傑姆和雪倫面對面坐在河邊總會裏吃飯。傑姆凑到雪倫的面前問道：「如果我昨天請你的時候，不說這是派給你的工作，而說是邀請你的，你亦答應我來的嗎」？雪倫假裝着在看菜單，可是她一個字都沒有看淸楚，她聽見傑姆問她話，就抬起頭來答應道：我亦來的，不過要多謝你一聲而巳。」傑姆不覺自己承認道：「我膽子小，恐怕你不來，所以祇好說是派給你的工作。」</p>
<p>傑姆本來是很能說笑取樂的，可是今天好似有什麽心事似的，覺得有些拘束起來。一回兒，他說：「我們到外面去散步。你要寫這個總會的新聞，你一定要知道這個總會的一切」。他們於是就站了起來，走到外面河邊的草地上散着步。他們有意的走得開些，但是每走了幾步，他們就會目然而然的走近了凑到一起的。他們覺得他們之間，有一種吸引力時時將他們凑在一起。傑姆道：「我想不到今天晚上竟這樣的美麗。」雪倫道：「我知道…我知道…」她亦說不出什麽話來了。</p>
<p>他們不知不覺的已經走到了草地的盡頭，離開了鬧熱地方。他們在幽暗之中，成了兩個黑越越的影子，在迷濛之中並立站着。後來那兩僩黑影漸漸合併成爲一個了。傑姆的臂膀將雪倫樓了過來，低聲說道：「雪倫，我愛你，我的寳貝。雪倫亦低聲喊着：「傑姆？」他吻着她的頭髮，柔軟，光滑，而香甜的頭髮。一回他又拿起她的手來吻着。他們這樣溫存了一回，於是就慢慢踱了回來。</p>
<p>這時屋子裏已經擠滿了人。其中有柏德森和他的夫人，坐在一起。旁邊不可缺少的，就是湯梅彭斯尼德。雪倫看見了他們，她伸手去取紙烟的時候，她的手微微有些顫動。她好似要說話，她又囁嚅着。最後，她才作色道：「你知道湯梅彭尼斯德今天要來的，要和珠麗亞柏德森同來的，所以你呌了我來，是不是？你並不是要和我在一起。不過要叫我看着他們，好叫我替你寫一段新聞而已！」傑姆很坦然地承認道：「不錯的，那是我的原意。不過我早就忘記了，直等到你提醒了我。」</p>
<p>雪倫不等他說完，早就站了起來道：「哦，原來如此，一憫新聞記者出來尋找新聞的，還點級着些談情說愛的事。對不起，我要回去子。」彭尼斯德這時已經走了過來。他對着雪倫道：「哈囉，今天眞巧，又看見你了。」雪倫道：「眞巧，我正要尋你。」一個侍者過來說：「外面有電話，請勃郞却先生去聽。」傑姆沒有法子，祇好走了開來去聽電話。（未完）</p>

<h3>平民住宅建築時（下）</h3>
<p>— 希浩</p>
<p>……應注意的幾點……</p>
<p>過去平民住宅上夜間光的問題，差不多完全是煤油燈，這也是最易促成火思的危險物，其實在這都市內電流供給，價廉而利便，如其完全裝置電燈，用此較低支光的燈泡，也和點煤油燈的價格相差無幾無幷且可以减少危險性，實在是最經濟的。所以，電燈的裝置，似乎在新的平民住宅上應有的設備。以上所述，都是根本的辦法。</p>
<p>至於治標的防止火患法，就是多預備意外用的自來水管，同時，應設法添置滅火機。至於門窗的安全，設計時亦應特別注意，以便意外時得自由出入。</p>
<p>（三）遊息問題，平民住宅的建造，最好不要和蜂窠一樣的密密排列；在可能範圍內，最好留出一部分向陽的空地，這個空地上面可以種幾棵樹或一排冬靑，假使經濟允許的話，不妨舖一層次等的草地，好在面積有限，須費很小。這個空地，可以使平民和他們的子女隨意地坐坐或休息休息，享受陽光的沐浴，使他們的生活格外來得有趣一點。</p>
<p>通俗圖書館的設置，實在是刻不容緩。一般平民空閑的時候，因缺乏智識的緣故，往往放縱於賭博等不良習慣。用最省的體積，設置一個圖書室，由十數個住宅中智識較高的份子管理和指導，隨時增進他們的智識，實在是推行普及敎育最妙的法子。這種圖書室的地位，可以在幾個住宅的中心點。</p>
<p>住宅的建築材料，最經濟的當然是木磚等，但是木料的持久性不佳，最好選擇較佳的木材。屋頂可採用薄板，上面再舖一層瓦，這種建築法，實在比較經濟一點啊。</p>
<p>以上所述幾點，不過擇其最重要的，其餘的小問題正多，却要賴建築師的努力啊。</p>
<h3>建築行話（八）</h3>
<p>— 梅震寰</p>
<p>——關於建塲裏用——</p>
<p>馬路鬼——馬路鬼這三個字的稱呼，在築塲裏除開「東家」之外，差不多算他最是尊貴了。然而爲什麽要呌「鬼」呢？這大概是我們貴中國人一向稱外國的碧眼兒呌做洋鬼的緣故，他是工部局建築處或工務局特派的調査員，他的責任是負担起整個房屋對於生命的安全問題而設置的監察的地位，他還有權力可以糾正建築師（卽打樣鬼）在學術上的錯誤的指導。所以馬路鬼在築塲裏，上至打樣鬼，下至看工等的限光中豎直是一隻老虎。</p>
<p>手拌——手拌（Hand　Mixed）的意思是什麽，就是用手做的工作。它的用塲呢，好像普通建築房屋如二層市房等對於水泥三和士的需要並不十分繁多，而不必要求「滾桶」的產量，的速率增加，所以就利用人的一雙手來拌了。</p>
<p>滾桶——（Rounding　Box）一隻圓形的鐵器，中間有一爿一爿薄而堅的鐵板做成的斜勢「隔斷」。用法，另外在滾桶上面搭以腳手架，舖上二寸十二寸洋松板，在滾桶後面鑲以鉛皮的簸直通洋松板上留的空隙，將水泥黃沙石子配好成分後逐步倒下去，滾桶依賴電力的旋轉，三四分鐘再在前面的中央空擋的地方倒出來，就變爲熟三和士了，（熟三和士是拌好的三和士。）</p>
<p>小車——形狀像獨輪車，專以搬運水泥三和士之類的東西而設。</p>
<p>吊車——假使建築的層數在六七層的高度，對於應用水泥三和士的搬運，一定非常困難，單靠浮橋（詳前）的轉遞，時間上感到不相宜，那末，補救的方法是用六寸方洋松木搭成架子，另用吊車將水泥三和士依賴電力像電梯般吊上去，這種車就呌吊車，形狀像兩頭撓起的小船。</p>
<p>壳子——鋼骨水泥三和士（Reinfored　Concerete）的工程，其起步手續的設備，是依照圖樣上的大小，長短，開闊，照尺寸將位置計算以後，用二寸十二寸洋松板配成模形，不論大料（Beam）柱子（Clumn）扶梯踏步（StairSteps）以及其他等等，然後扎鐵。鐵扎齊，就可以搗水泥三和士了，這種模形呌做壳子（Formor　Centerig）</p>
<p>扎鐵——扎鐡（Steel　Elector）的意思，就是在配齊的売子內，（不論大料柱子，扶梯踏步等等）將鋼骨一根一根用燒熟的鉛絲扎牢，如元寳鐡，灣鐵，加鐵，直鐵，環鐵，樓板鐵等都是扎鐵中的名稱的類別。</p>
<p>立鐵——豎立洋松柱子或水泥柱子壳子板，皆稱之立鐵。</p>
<p>天盤——窗的下冒頭可以放置物件的地方呌窗盤，其上冒頭凸出的呌天盤，（Toothing）</p>
<p>度頭——度頭（Lining）就是門或窗的兩旁的「邊挺」的地方呌做度頭。房屋比較考究的，都鑲以度頭板，（CliningBoard）</p>
<p>薪架——用舊料如六寸方，八寸方，十寸方，十二寸方等方子搭成的四方架子，預備在上而放置重量的料作之用。</p>
<p>惠林——普通打板椿，在開挖坭土時，因爲深度的利害，防止板樁受外間壓力的相擠，或有崩毁之虞，所以預先在板樁（SheetPile）的周圍加上一道或數道惠林，（Wiling）大約十二寸方，或十寸方洋松不等。（待續）</p>
<h3>人造石的透視與造法</h3>
<p>— 冲</p>
<p>人造石或稱磨石子。和大理石遠看彷彿如似，牠的性質也很堅硬，但沒有大理石那麽的堅硬。因爲這種人造石是拿水和各種顏色石子所造成的，所以牠的質地是和水門汀一樣的，但不過加了幾次摩工而已。在水門汀上受了機器的摩擦之後，就變成很光滑的，和大理石看起來是差不多的。若在跳舞塲裏，或者大的廳上，配了這種地板是很適宜，可謂經濟而且又堂皇，美麗。做這種地板可說是「一勞永逸」可以免去常常修理之麻煩了。</p>
<p>人造石的地板有下列幾種很好特點：</p>
<p>（一）可以自己選定自己所歡喜的顏色，而且永不退色。</p>
<p>（二）可以做各種各樣的花式。</p>
<p>（三）可以不必上蠟的麻煩。</p>
<p>（四）牠的質地比較木地板來得堅硬，而且又美麗。</p>
<p>（五）可以不必常常修理，或者換新的牠的造法：（一）用山和土做底腳，約六寸高，（二）水泥，黃沙和石子（普遍石子）掏和後復在山和土上約三四英寸。（三）用水泥和黄沙，掏和後再復在牠上面，約二英寸厚。（四）用油毛氈復在水泥上，再用柏油膠老。因爲要防止地下的水氣上升之故。（五）上面再復上一層水泥和黃沙，約二英寸厚。（六）再用半英寸闊二分厚的銅皮，竪直排列起來，排成相等的方格形，或者排出各式各樣的花樣也可以，在銅皮接頭處，用水泥膠老。（七）然後再把水泥和各種顏色，再和各種顏色石子（這種顏色石子是意大利出產的），掏和起來，然後把這種顏色水泥，一一的嵌進去，要什麼顏色就用什麽顏色，等到都嵌完了。第一步水泥匠的工作已經算完畢了。</p>
<p>第二步，就是山東人摩石子了。他們摩石子，有一種專門摩石子的機器，機器上有一只馬達，下面有一個轉盤，在這轉盤上面，有三塊摩石子的石頭，這三塊石頭粗細可以隨意換的。馬達一開，因爲轉盤轉動了，所以下面的三塊石頭，也隨之而在地上摩擦了。</p>
<p>他們摩石子的手續一共要三次。第一次在一星期後，他們是用最粗料的摩石子的石頭，裝在轉盤上，等到雷力一開，就在地上摩擦了，這一次摩的時間，要算最長的了，因爲要摩脫上面一層不潔的水泥後，就能看得見下面的顏色和美麗的顏色石子，還有二分厚金色的銅條，也顯露在上面了。在那時候，各種顏色的格子，和金黄色的邊，已經都能看見了，但是很不光滑。第二次所摩的石子，要比第一次細了，摩的時候也短了。接着就是第三次摩了，是換用一種最細的石頭摩，並且還要洒一種很細的雪白色的白粉（粉名不詳，據說含毒質在內）在地上，再用機器去摩牠。聽說這種粉，能使石子摩得出光彩，而且來得光滑，還能使這種顏色鮮而美呢。</p>
<h3>建築材料學（九）</h3>
<p>— 朱枕木</p>
<p>（四）加銅——鋼中若於提練時，加入銅質百分之一二，可阻擋電戚，而得以防銹。鉻亦有此效，市有不銹鋼者，均係含有此質這故。</p>
<p>（五）磨光——因鋼板表面之凹凸參差，可造成本身陰陽電極，易致生銹，而若磨光之後，可除此患。</p>
<p>第三節　銲接法</p>
<p>鋼鐡之應用，其連接之法，有鉚接，釘接等均屬普通。而另有銲接一法，容有在此略述之必要。</p>
<p>力接法有力銲及熔銲兩種：</p>
<p>力銲——力銲乃以鐵板之兩端，稍加熱力？使軟，而用力敲擊使相接之法。</p>
<p>熔銲——銲乃以鐵板之兩端，共同受熱使熔，而相互黏合，待冷却時卽已合併銲接於一處，其加熱法又分三類：</p>
<p>吹管法——用Acetglene阿珊搭靈與氧氣之混合氣體，經吹管吹出着火，可得華氏一八〇〇度之髙溫，足使鋼鐵熔銲。此法便於急救，用者極廣。</p>
<p>（二）還原法——以二氧化鐵及鋁之混合物，燒紅至華氏四千度，可得鐵液，而傾上接縫，卽可銲接。此法用於修補破裂者居多。</p>
<p>（三）電銲法——以交流或直流電，用兩相距電極放電，可使鋼鐵熔解銲接。此法於鋼鐵物之製造時用之最多。（第五章完）</p>

<h3>Liu Xiang Reports: Sichuan-Guizhou Bandit Suppression Situation; Dingshui Temple and Huangguan Recovered</h3>
<p>(Chongqing) Liu Xiang reported in the enlarged memorial weekly meeting on the 8th morning, briefly stating: Zhu and Mao's remnant bandits are at the end of their road and fleeing in disorder. More than a thousand people north of the Wu River have been cleared. Xifeng has been recovered. Most of the bandits have fled to Pingyue and are incapable of action. After encirclement, it will not be difficult to eliminate them. Xu's bandits in northern Sichuan, after abandoning their old nest, have no natural defenses and are also blocked by rivers. Encirclement and suppression on the west bank of the Jialing River are very advantageous militarily. Our army's formation is excellent, and it is truly an excellent opportunity to suppress the bandits. The communist bandits adopt killing as their policy, and the people are terrified. In the future, we should appease the people politically and treat surrendered bandits who were coerced leniently, which will make bandit suppression easier to succeed.

<h3>Hebei Provincial Government Strictly Investigates Private Shipment of Silver Out of the Country</h3>
<p>(Beiping) Since the pseudo-organizations and the Japanese established agencies in Yuguan, they have been absorbing a large amount of silver from our country.

<h3>"The Great Learning as Chinese Political Philosophy": Chairman Lin Reports at National Government Memorial Weekly Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The National Government held a memorial weekly meeting on the morning of the 8th. Lin Xiang, Chen Xunyong, Lu Chao, Wei Huai, and other officials from various departments and committees, a total of more than 500 people, attended. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, he gave a report entitled "The Great Learning as Chinese Political Philosophy." He first said in the sixth lecture of nationalism: "The section in the Great Learning that says 'investigate things, extend knowledge, make the will sincere, rectify the heart, cultivate the person, regulate the family, govern the state, and pacify the world' is a unique treasure in our political philosophy. Comrades should carefully study this theory of the Premier." We know that a country can preserve its long history in the world because its people have a special culture that is believed and relied upon by the general public, especially relying on the outstanding members of society to develop and promote it, becoming a systematic theory. The Premier took the revival of China as his own responsibility, believing that to revive China, it is necessary to restore the inherent knowledge. This knowledge is most clearly explained in the Great Learning. We must not forget our treasure. Second, he said that since the Southern Song Dynasty, the trend of Chinese talent and scholarship can be roughly divided into three schools: (1) Neo-Confucianists, (2) Literati, and (3) Politicians. However, when considering the consistent principles of the Great Learning, none of them fully conform. With the eastward spread of European learning, schools teach science, which is more precise and practical than the former self-cultivation of knowledge, but it focuses on material things and inevitably neglects self-cultivation. Students like the new and dislike the old, which has become a psychology. Given the current difficult situation and urgent time in our country, and the many aspects and urgent need for talents in the construction of the future, there should be a fundamental method of cultivation so that the talents obtained can combine theory and practice and be stored as great vessels. Therefore, the Premier specifically put forward the section of the Great Learning to awaken intellectuals, especially those who have leadership responsibilities, and they should pay more attention. He continued by saying that the Premier spoke even more painfully about the Chinese people's inability to cultivate themselves. To talk about self-cultivation, one must first seek self-consistency. The ancients said, "Establish others after establishing yourself, and reach others after reaching yourself." According to this, private law and public law cannot be separated. It can be seen that cultivating the mind and body and governing the state and pacifying the world are interconnected. The New Life Movement also starts from self-cultivation. If everyone's ability to govern themselves is strong, it will naturally strengthen society and the country. Finally, he said that the Premier's greatness lies in his ability to integrate ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign theories and invent refined principles, saying that the effort in this section of the Great Learning is to save the ills of emptiness and detachment, make people know how to apply learning, have no use for empty words, and maintain the self-confidence of our nation, knowing that the teachings of the sages should not be lightly forgotten. If we can take self-cultivation as the foundation and earnestly talk about the method of governing the country, systematically and orderly, this is the foundation of national revival. As for pushing to pacify the world and entering the world to the Great Harmony, it is also the responsibility of a nation based on the Three Principles of the People. I hope everyone will follow the legacy and get excited. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Hong Lutung Reports on the Issue of Supervisory Commissioners at Central Memorial Weekly Meeting</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Central Government held a memorial weekly meeting on the morning of the 8th. Ju Zheng, Hong Lutung, Wang Qi, Li Zonghuang, and staff members, a total of 600 people, attended. Chairman Ju Zheng said that the Central Committee originally designated Dai Chuanxian to give the report, but because Dai was in Shanghai and had not returned to Nanjing, Hong Lutung was changed to give the report. Hong discussed the issue of the Central Committee sending special commissioners of party affairs to serve as supervisory commissioners. The meeting adjourned at 9:30 am. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Ma Chaojun Assumes Post as Mayor of Nanjing; Discusses Policy Opinions</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Chaojun went to the Nanjing Municipal Government on the morning of the 8th to take over. The swearing-in ceremony was held at 8:00 am. Xiao Jishan from the Central Committee, Chen Lifu from the National Government, and Liu Yong from the Executive Yuan were sent to supervise. Those who attended the ceremony included Chen Zhuo, Zhang Zhizhuan, Shi Shangkuan, Zhong Tianxin, Xu Xiuzhi, Ma Xiang, Chen Jianru, Lai Lian, Zhou Bomin, officials from the Legislative Yuan, the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Hall, the Municipal Government, and representatives from various people's groups, a total of more than 1,000 people. After Xiao Jishan led the ceremony in an orderly manner, Ma Chaojun took the oath. Subsequently, Xiao Jishan, Chen Lifu, Liu Yong, Xu Xiuzhi, and Zhou Bomin delivered training speeches or speeches on behalf of the Central Committee, the National Government, the Executive Yuan, the Interior Ministry, and the Municipal Party Headquarters. Guests Zhang Zhihan and others gave speeches. Ma gave a reply. The ceremony was then completed, photographs were taken, and the meeting was dismissed. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Ma Chaojun met with reporters at the Municipal Government on the morning of the 8th. According to him, the Municipal Council is a representative body of the people of the whole city and should be actively planned to facilitate municipal development. Expanding the organization of the Municipal Government should be based on factual needs. However, according to my past experience, the momentum of tails wagging dogs seems to be best to maintain the status quo temporarily. Nanjing's finances have always been difficult, and in the future, we should focus on increasing revenue and reducing expenditure. As for the use of funds, the principle of increasing business expenditure and reducing administrative expenditure should still be followed. The newly appointed Director of the Finance Bureau is an overseas Chinese who studied in the United States and has rich knowledge of economics. Inviting him to preside over Nanjing's finances this time is not only to seek financial reorganization in Nanjing, but also to encourage overseas Chinese to serve the motherland and invest in the construction of the motherland. After the discussion, he took photos with the reporters at the entrance of the conference hall of the Municipal Government and left. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After taking office on the 8th, in addition to submitting reports and issuing orders to all parties and making public announcements, Ma Chaojun announced that Wang Shufang would be the Secretary-General, Lu Zhaochuang would be the Director of Finance, Chen Jianru would be the Director of Social Affairs, Song Xishang would be the Director of Public Works, Zhou Xiang would be the Counselor, and Shen Shiji would be the Chief of the First Section of the Secretariat. He also sent Pan Geya, Yuan Xiaolan, Zhao Jianguang, and 15 others to take over the Finance Bureau on the 8th. The Social Affairs Bureau and the Public Works Bureau are scheduled to take over on the 9th. (Central News Agency dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) At Ma Chaojun's inauguration ceremony, Xiao Jishan, representing the Central Committee, gave a training speech, briefly saying that Mayor Ma has always been known for his meritorious service in revolutionary work and has a thorough understanding of municipal administration. This time, he will take charge of Nanjing again and will surely make great achievements to live up to the expectations of the Central Committee and the citizens. Then Chen Lifu, representing the National Government, gave a training speech, briefly saying that Mayor Ma has made great efforts in legislative work. In the future, he will change to administrative work, and he will be able to gain a better understanding of the smooth implementation of legislation. Therefore, Ma's appointment as mayor will not only benefit the citizens, but also contribute his administrative achievements to the legislative authorities as a legislative standard. Finally, he said that we do not need the construction of cities filled with neon lights. Training urban people to become substantive citizens of modern cities is the urban construction that we truly need. Ma's reply was very long, generally saying that he will establish a municipal council to communicate the opinions of the people and the government, respect public opinion, and refer to it for improving administration. He will closely contact the Municipal Party Headquarters to achieve the effectiveness of promoting municipal administration. The restoration of the Education Bureau will have to wait for an inspection before a decision can be made. Efforts will still be made to increase the welfare of the common people and prosper the city. Nanjing's construction will be carried out from both material and psychological aspects. Finally, he said that for the entire municipal administration, he intends to first formulate a concrete plan and select the key points as our central work, hoping that all sectors will give guidance and cooperation.

<p>(Nanjing) The Jiangsu Provincial Federation of Commerce telegraphed to the Ministry of Finance, stating that the Jiangsu Province business tax regulations, which start collecting in the first month, end in the second month, charge a penalty for overdue payments, and suspend business after two months, are difficult for businesses to accept. They requested that the order be withdrawn and that the method of quarterly payment be restored. After consulting with the Jiangsu Provincial Government, it was reported that the Finance Department had issued a notice that the old regulations would still be followed, with the first month of each quarter beginning the collection and the deadline on the first day of the following quarter, implementing the verification of overdue fines. The Ministry of Finance telegraphed to the Federation of Commerce on the 8th to inform them. (Special dispatch, 8th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Finance plans to implement an income tax, which has been drafted by the Tax Division and is nearing completion. After Finance Minister Kong approves it, it will be submitted to the Executive Yuan and then to the Legislative Yuan for review. Regarding the income tax rate issue, there are opinions from all sides, some advocating for an increase and others for a decrease. The Ministry of Finance is collecting opinions and studying them in detail. The Ministry of Finance previously planned to abolish the transit tax and reduce the export tax in order to prosper the market and revive the countryside, and will use part of the income tax to compensate.

<h3>Austrian Rearmament and the European Situation</h3>
<p>— A Cold Observation</p>
<p>A Vienna dispatch reported a few days ago that the Austrian government has issued a statement planning to immediately reinstate conscription and begin preparations to increase the army to 65,000 men. It also intends to send a special envoy to participate in the Stresa Conference on the 11th of this month (the conference of England, France, and Italy), requesting the great powers to allow it. Hungary and Bulgaria also intend to request the same, following suit. Although the steps taken are different from Germany's outright abandonment of the treaty, it is quite obvious that Austria is unwilling to be bound by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. The Treaty of Saint-Germain was the treaty between various countries and Austria after the Great War, signed on September 10, 1919, in the Château de Saint-Germain-en-Laye, southeast of Paris. According to Article 4 of the treaty, restrictions on Austrian armaments were very strict, such as the total number of the army not exceeding 30,000 men, and the abolition of conscription forever. This was exactly the same as the intention of the Treaty of Versailles to restrict German armaments. Germany has already rearmed, officially establishing an air force on April 1. Hitler himself admitted that the strength of his country's air force is comparable to that of Britain. This was due to secret arrangements made in advance and relentless progress according to a predetermined plan, until preparations were complete before openly announcing it. Now Austria has also announced its rearmament, using Germany's actions as an excuse. Since Germany has freely shaken off the constraints of the Treaty of Versailles, Austria no longer needs to be restricted by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. The authorities of the two countries defend themselves, saying that the actions of the great powers today prioritize strengthening their military power, and they cannot solely blame Germany and Austria for abiding by the treaty. Their arguments are not without merit.</p>
<p>Consequently, recent speculation about the future of peace in Europe is varied and inconclusive. Generally speaking, there are two schools of thought: pessimistic and optimistic. Pessimists believe that the rearmament of Germany and Austria, one after the other, is a sign of the eve of the Second World War. Since the September 18th Incident, the League of Nations has been unable to sanction Japan, and the covenant is merely a formality. Now Germany and Austria have torn up the Treaties of Paris, and the great powers can do nothing about it. In the future, international disputes will have no way to be resolved except by resorting to force. Existing treaties will become waste paper. There are also so-called Central European Pacts and Eastern European Pacts, which are being discussed and implemented. Those who violate agreements and betray trust can act with impunity. Even if new treaties are concluded, it will be in vain. The internal contradictions of imperialism will always exist, and the opportunity for bloody conflict cannot be avoided. The great powers glare at each other, tensions are high, and the outbreak of the Second World War is not far off. However, optimists say that this is not entirely true. When hostilities broke out in August 1914, Germany relied on its well-equipped army and allied support, and Ning was the leader of the war. But now times have changed. Germany has fallen into a state of isolation. Although it has violated its vows and rearmed, it may not be able to regain its power in Europe. Moreover, its old ally, Austria, is apprehensive day and night, fearing annexation by Germany. This declaration to reinstate conscription, nominally a request to follow suit, is actually a strict precaution against Germany. In diplomatic terms, it has obtained the understanding of France, so the Austrian authorities are confident and resolute in taking this step. On January 7 of this year, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and French Foreign Minister Laval signed the Rome Accords. On February 3, Laval and British Foreign Secretary Simon issued the London Declaration. These people have done their best to avoid war and protect European security. The Soviet Union is close to France, and France is allied with Britain and Italy. Their common intention to counter Germany is clearly visible. Even if Germany fully restores its military strength to its former state, how dare it rashly provoke war and repeat its mistakes? As for the attitude of the British authorities, they have always advocated amending the military clauses in the Treaty of Versailles. Some say that this is protecting Germany, but this is not entirely true. Germany has been deliberately unwilling to be bound by the Treaty of Versailles. Not only the British, but also other countries' authorities have long been aware of this. Its military reorganization has been going on for a long time, and it was only recently publicly announced. Since other countries cannot stop it, it is useless to leave restrictions on paper. Therefore, the London Declaration proposes to amend the military clauses. British dignitaries like Eden have been traveling between Moscow, Warsaw, and Berlin, working tirelessly to maintain the balance of power in Europe. According to recent reports from London, Eden's visit to Moscow was met with quite close discussions. The House of Commons does not urgently request the government to explain the situation of negotiations with the Soviet Union, and the majority party is already showing goodwill. From this, it can be inferred that Britain's attitude is to increase friendship with the Soviet Union. It is neither anti-Soviet nor pro-German. The only difference between its attitude towards Germany and that of France is that it is more moderate. In short, European powers such as Britain, the Soviet Union, France, and Italy are not only doing their best to strengthen their military power, but also mediating for peace in order to avoid war. Austria's release from the bonds of the Treaty of Saint-Germain and its request for the great powers to allow it are different from Germany's outright abandonment of the treaty. It is still uncertain whether the European situation will not break down, but it is unlikely that war will break out in the near future.</p>
<p>Both of the above arguments can be justified and have some basis. We do not need to force a judgment. Judging from the current efforts of all parties to pursue peace, the optimistic view seems more powerful. However, considering the fanaticism of various countries in expanding their military power and the increasingly tense international situation, the pessimistic view has strong reasons. However, there are two points that must be pointed out. First, the instability and unease of the European situation are obvious facts that no one can deny. Second, whether the European situation will not break down is something that no one dares to guarantee. With these two points clear, our countrymen should realize that trouble in Europe is not a blessing for China. If our country is still in the memory of the Eastern oppression it suffered during the First World War, then before the Second World War comes, our countrymen should be vigilant and make preparations in advance.</p>

<h3>To Soothe the European Situation, Britain Plans to Open a New Path: To Abandon the Eastern European Security Pact; The Opinions of the Three Countries are Diametrically Opposed; The Stresa Conference Opens on Thursday; It is Decided that the Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Will Participate</h3>
<p>(London) It was learned tonight that the cabinet has a tendency to abandon the Eastern European Security Pact and open a new path to achieve an agreement. The so-called "new route" should be formed at tomorrow's cabinet meeting. The government now believes that the Eastern European Pact contains clauses on military assistance, which have now been aborted due to the opposition of Germany and Poland to the participation of Soviet Russia. In view of this situation, Britain is gradually advocating that it is unwilling to participate in any mutual assistance agreement other than the Western European Pact. If France and Russia disregard Germany and conclude this Eastern European Pact on their own, Britain can only stand by. According to a Paris dispatch, Britain's attitude has increased the frustration of people in the French capital, because the French authorities believe that the opinions of Britain, France, and Italy are diametrically opposed, which is enough to endanger the Stresa Conference. According to news from here, Britain is willing to see the non-aggression treaty extended to the European continent, but it is unwilling to be drawn into the whirlpool of war. The military alliance of France, Russia, and Czechoslovakia may take a sharp turn for the worse. These three countries also hope that Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania will act in unison. Germany is recuperating, quietly watching the changes, and believes that after its strength is sufficient, it will not worry about having allies. (National Telegram on the 7th)</p>

<p>Cabinet Listens to Report</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the cabinet held a special meeting to discuss the detailed records and personal impressions of the talks with the authorities during Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden's visits to several European capitals, which lasted for two hours. Then, the people who will attend the Stresa Conference were decided. Simon will make a brief statement in the House of Commons today, and plans to make a longer general statement tomorrow.</p>
<p>Eden Absent Due to Illness</p>
<p>Eden was unable to attend the cabinet meeting today due to excessive fatigue from the trip. According to a bulletin issued by his medical advisor today, Eden's mind is restless due to excessive fatigue from recent air travel. His condition is not a cause for concern, but he must rest for four to six weeks. The British government and the public were concerned when they heard the news of Eden's illness. Prime Minister MacDonald visited him and said that he was worried about Eden's illness for both public and private reasons. Currently, telegrams are pouring in from all over the world wishing Eden a speedy recovery, many of whom are friends he met on this trip. Simon and Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Vansittart visited Eden on Saturday and Sunday. On Sunday, the Prime Minister also visited him to discuss the results of the visits to various countries. Since taking office as Lord Privy Seal last year, Eden has traveled thousands of miles by air, land, and sea. He has visited Geneva five times, and has been to Paris, Rome, and Berlin for disarmament issues. He has also reciprocated visits to Denmark, Norway, and Sweden. (Reuters Telegram on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Lord Privy Seal Eden of Britain has visited Germany, Russia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, and after returning to Britain, he has fallen slightly ill. He cannot attend the cabinet meeting today and will not go to the Stresa Conference. The Paris Echo newspaper regrets this news. The newspaper also learned that the British government will be represented by Prime Minister MacDonald at the Stresa Conference. According to a report from the London Daily News, this matter has been confirmed and will be decided at today's British cabinet meeting. Therefore, the Paris Echo said that since the British Prime Minister is participating in person, Premier Flandin should also attend, because it is necessary for the British, French, and Italian government authorities to discuss everything face-to-face at the Stresa Conference. (Havas Telegram on the 8th)</p>
<h3>French Communist Party Representative Selection Decided at Today's Cabinet Meeting</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Stresa Conference of Britain, France, and Italy is about to be held. Regarding the selection of representatives from France, according to responsible parties, in addition to Foreign Minister Laval deciding to attend in person, Premier Flandin may also go, but the final decision will be made after tomorrow's cabinet meeting. (Havas Telegram on the 8th) A "Certain Times" newspaper commented on the European situation, saying, "There are now three possible steps: first, cooperate with Germany; second, unite to defend against Germany; and third, a messy front with unclear responsibilities. One of the above three must be clearly chosen. The newspaper believes that the Stresa Conference should be the final solution, but if various covenants are signed to cover up the situation, it will inevitably fall into a magic circle, create a bad atmosphere, and fail to achieve a practical solution. The danger of this is extreme. There are also many strategies being attempted now. One group advocates signing bilateral covenants to oppose regional covenants, while another advocates general covenants with safeguards and sanctions to oppose covenants without sanctions. However, in any case, adopting a middle-ground solution is better than allowing a chaotic and uneasy atmosphere to continue to prolong." (Havas Telegram on the 8th)</p>
<h3>British Diplomatic Strategy: Expected to Be No More Than Two Paths</h3>
<p>(London) All newspapers attach great importance to today's cabinet meeting, believing that its resolutions are extremely relevant to British foreign policy. The newspapers regret that Lord Privy Seal Eden cannot attend the cabinet meeting to report on his visits to Germany, Russia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia. The Morning Post said, "The problem that should be solved now is whether Britain should continue to be a mediator between the European powers, or decisively decide to join one side of the opponents of amending the treaty." The newspaper believes that it is not impossible to seek a compromise with Germany, but to establish a final coordination, it will take many years. If there are no better guarantees at present to prevent the National Socialist Party from taking reckless actions again, then the actions of the great powers to resist Germany with force are inevitable. The London Daily News has a similar view, saying that British foreign policy is no more than two paths: one is to maintain the current state of isolation, which is neither glorious nor sustainable, and the other is to resolutely assist in collective action under the leadership of the League of Nations. Which of these two paths Britain will choose is the key to the future peace of Europe. The majority of British cabinet members agree with the principle of collective action, because only collective action can prevent the outbreak of war in the present and future. The Times said that Britain is unwilling to engage in war, but Britain should express its firm opposition to those who engage in war. Moreover, Britain must find ways to eliminate the current uneasy situation in the international community so that the latent roots of war can be completely eliminated. The newspaper also said that there is no danger of any aggression at present. The goal of British diplomatic efforts is to make Germany join the collective peace system and the League of Nations. The Daily Herald said that if one of the three, the British-French-Italian Pact, the Eastern European Pact, or the Western European Pact, is missing, there is no way to generate a sense of peace. To ensure peace in Europe, it is necessary to first increase the strength of Geneva, and then start discussing the amendment of the treaty. (Havas Telegram on the 8th)</p>
<h3>French Foreign Minister Will Succeed Eden in Visiting the Capitals of Russia and Poland; Departure Scheduled for the 23rd of This Month; Discussing the Situation Caused by German Rearmament</h3>

The purpose of this trip is to discuss ways to alleviate the serious situation caused by Germany's decision to rearm. Laval will leave Paris for Moscow on April 23 and will stay in the Russian capital for about three days before going to Warsaw. (Reuters Telegram on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Italy Is Willing to Join Hands With Southern Countries to Oppose the Forcible Amendment of the Treaty</h3>
<p>The newly appointed Italian ambassador to Yugoslavia's capital, Gambardo, recently gave an interview to the Truth newspaper, saying, "Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has the best intentions towards Yugoslavia and is willing to establish a lasting compromise with the southern country. If there are disputes between the two countries, they should be resolved. For example, the two countries have signed several agreements, but they have not been implemented for various reasons. After this is resolved, a new commercial treaty should be signed and a friendly treaty should be prepared, or the existing friendly treaty should be extended." Gambardo further explained that the late King Alexander I of the Southern Kingdom and the late French Foreign Minister Barthou also supported Italy and the Southern Kingdom working together, and said, "Italy recognizes the Little Entente as a good international organization with the ability to survive and political ideas. As for the issue of amending the treaty, Article 19 of the League of Nations Covenant has already stated that international treaties can be amended, but they must be carried out through legal procedures. Italy has always opposed forcibly amending it." (Havas Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>People in Paris Donate to Build a Memorial for the Late King of the South</h3>
<p>(Paris) A public fundraising was held here today to build a memorial for the former King Alexander I of Yugoslavia. The government specially allowed this day to be a national fundraising day. Foreign Minister Laval also gave a wireless radio speech last night, asking the people of France to contribute generously. From this morning, male and female team members in Paris streets, with tricolor national emblems wrapped around their arms, were asking passers-by to donate. All donors were given a badge to wear on their chest to show their recognition. The badge depicts a portrait of King Alexander of the South, surrounded by a wreath, with a Yugoslav flag painted on top. (Havas Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<h3>Following in Germany's Footsteps, Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria Will Demand Military Expansion; Britain and Italy Tend to Support It; The Restoration of Austria Is Temporarily Deferred</h3>
<p>(Rome) The Italian People's Newspaper, which has a semi-official nature, hinted today that the Italian government is willing to support any action by Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria to expand their armies. The newspaper discussed the level of armaments of the three countries, saying that it is a crime that violates any principle of international equality that strong countries like Germany are allowed to unilaterally rearm, while weak countries are not allowed to have this right. Italy's attitude on this matter will be stated at the Stresa Conference. (Reuters Telegram on the 7th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The semi-official "Italian People's Newspaper" published an article discussing the increase in armaments of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria, stating, "Why not generously acknowledge the military clauses of the treaty that were unilaterally decided to be abolished, based on justice? The treaty should be amended by those responsible for peace as an act of reconciliation, so that on the one hand, the treaty is not openly violated, and on the other hand, violent protests are not made. If the military clauses in the treaty are amended in a friendly spirit, then the distinction between the victorious and defeated countries can be completely eliminated, and the relationship between the three countries of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria and the Little Entente will inevitably be improved." (Havas Telegram on the 8th)</p>
<p>(Vienna) Austria is very excited today, and the public's attention has once again focused on the possibility of a Habsburg royal restoration. Officials still deny that Austria's request to the great powers to allow it to double its army is aimed at preparing for Archduke Otto to ascend the throne. However, rumors have spread on the borders of Romania and Yugoslavia, and it has been announced that the Little Entente will do its utmost to oppose the amendment of the Treaty of Saint-Germain, which stipulates that Austria's army is currently only allowed to have 30,000 long-term volunteer soldiers. Austria has announced that it will send representatives to the Stresa Conference to request a doubling of the military quota and to implement conscription. Italy has expressed its support for the plan, and Britain has expressed its agreement if Austria can abide by the Treaty of Saint-Germain. Bulgaria and Hungary have also requested to increase their military strength, saying that the surrounding countries are all strong in military equipment, and their military strength is weak, making it difficult for them to defend themselves. As for Austrian Prime Minister Schuschnigg and Foreign Minister Woudenegg, they are both pro-imperialist figures, but because of the opposition of other countries and their unwillingness to offend Britain and France, they have not yet tried to have Archduke Otto ascend the throne. The Austrian Prime Minister once said that if the National Socialist Party does not plan to seize power, he will not resort to the restoration route. At present, Archduke Otto and his mother are still living in the suburbs of Brussels. It is said that economic problems are the biggest obstacle to the current restoration movement. Austria is unable to support a monarch, because if Otto ascends the throne, more than 200 impoverished archdukes and archduchesses will return to the country with him, and they all need to be supported by the state. The cost is shocking. After the war, Austria was a beggar country in Europe, and its living resources were subject to the treaty. Therefore, the pain it suffered from the treaty was more than that of other countries. Therefore, Britain and Italy deeply feel that Austria should be rewarded. According to observers, regardless of whether the Stresa Conference can allow Austria to rearm, Archduke Otto has no hope of restoration for the time being, because if the Habsburg royal family is restored without the consent of the Little Entente, war may follow within a short time. As for why the Little Entente opposes it, there are various reasons. After the restoration, Austria will be easier to unify and become stronger. Therefore, the Catholic people of the Little Entente will also seek to establish a monarch of the Habsburg royal family in their respective countries. Moreover, the Slavic people of the Czech Republic, the Croat people of Yugoslavia, and the Transylvanian people of Romania are all Catholics and may be drawn to Austria. It is heard that the great powers such as Britain, France, and Italy are no longer very opposed to the restoration of Austria. The leaders of the three countries all believe that after Austria restores the imperial system, it may be able to contain Hitler's ambitions in Central and Southern Europe. If the great powers do not oppose it, it is only a matter of time before the Little Entente changes its attitude. (National Telegram on the 8th)</p>
<h3>Austrian Army Grand Review: The Prime Minister Exhorts the Soldiers to Work Together to Fight for Independence</h3>

<h3>The Austrian Situation Is Tense Again: The Storm Troopers and the Home Guard Are at Odds; The Two Extremist Factions Are Taking Advantage of the Opportunity to Stir Up Trouble Again</h3>
<p>(Vienna) The Austrian situation is tense again today, because the government's two major private armies, namely Prime Minister Schuschnigg's Storm Troopers and Prince Starhemberg's Home Guard, are at odds. The National Socialist Party and the Communist Party are taking advantage of the opportunity to stir up trouble again. As for the jealousy between the Storm Troopers and the Home Guard, it is mainly due to the fact that one side plans to squeeze Starhemberg to be the regent. Starhemberg's regency is only a transition for the Habsburg restoration. The two armies recently clashed in small towns. There are also rumors in Vienna that Prime Minister Schuschnigg is tired of his job and that the fascism he is pursuing is nearing its end. (National Telegram on the 7th)</p>

<h3>The Result of the Danzig Parliament Re-election: The German Nazi Party's Long-Held Wish Unfulfilled; Fails to Obtain Two-Thirds of the Votes; Constitutional Amendment Dreams Dashed</h3>
<p>Danzig: The preliminary results of the city council elections are as follows: Nazi Party 139,729 votes (in the May 1933 elections, it was 109,729 votes); Social Democratic Party 37,015 votes (previously 37,882 votes); Communist Party 7,990 votes (previously 14,566 votes); Catholic Center Party 31,525 votes (previously 31,336 votes); German National People's Party 9,691 votes (previously 13,596 votes); Polish people 8,130 votes (previously 6,743 votes); Veterans Opposition 385 votes.</p>
<p>In summary, the Nazi Party's obtained votes do not reach 60% of the total. (Havas Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Danzig: The Nazi Party is greatly disappointed with the results of yesterday's election. According to the latest figures, the number of seats held by each party in the new parliament is as follows:</p>
<p>Nazi Party 44, Social Democratic Party 12, Center Party 9, German National People's Party 3, Communist Party and Polish Party 2 each. The Nazi Party only gained four more seats than last time. Dr. Rauschning, who served as the Administrative President of Danzig from July 1933 until his resignation in 1934, fled the area today, presumably to Poland. It is said that the Nazi Party regards him as a traitor and intends to harm him. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels said in a speech on Saturday that the Nazi Party should not pay attention to people like Rauschning because he has already committed spiritual suicide. (Reuters Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>Danzig: In yesterday's election for the new parliament in Danzig, despite the German propaganda machine's all-out efforts to obtain a two-thirds majority in order to petition the League of Nations to change the constitution of the Free City, the result was only a three-fifths majority. The total number of votes obtained by the Nazi Party this time was approximately 30,000 more than in the previous election in 1933.</p>
<p>During the vote count, the representative of the Polish government in Danzig stated that the Germans had used terror tactics during the election and that it should be considered illegal. According to a note from the representative to the Danzig authorities, two Polish employees in his office were beaten up early yesterday morning and should be compensated for their losses. Voting began at 9:00 AM yesterday, and approximately 25% of the people went to the polling stations. By the afternoon, 70% of the voters had cast their ballots. On that day, flags flew throughout the city, and various parties held demonstrations in the city center. However, apart from the beating of the two Polish employees, no other incidents occurred. The German government provided travel expenses to 6,000 Danzig citizens and arranged special transportation to bring them to vote. It also sent capable personnel such as Hess, a confidant of the German leader, Gauleiter Bruckner of Saar, Propaganda Minister Goebbels, and Prussian President Göring to campaign, expecting to obtain a two-thirds majority in order to change the constitution of the Free City and break away from the protection of the League of Nations. Unexpectedly, their wish was not fulfilled. (Reuters Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The newspapers believe that this election of the Danzig Free City Council, although heavily promoted by the German Nazi Party, can be considered a partial failure or a partial success when its results are compared with the 1933 elections. Le Petit Parisien reported, "If this failure is finally confirmed, it will inevitably cause a profound reaction on the German side and be regarded as the first defeat of Nazism. If Germany wants to amend the current constitution of Danzig City according to legal procedures and merge the Danzig City administration with the German administration, the Nazi Party must obtain two-thirds of the total votes to succeed. In addition, some political circles are deeply concerned that if the election results disappoint Germany, the Nazi Party may stage a military coup." The newspaper also stated, "The Nazi Party's major propaganda efforts and sudden victory were due to unity and organization. The Nazi Party's small victory this time is particularly frightening because it will cause the German government's oppressive policies to continue unabated." L'Écho de Paris stated, "The League of Nations should pay more attention to the current system of Danzig City than in the past. The League of Nations should especially remember the words of German Propaganda Minister Goebbels yesterday that Danzig City will sooner or later fall into the arms of Germany because this statement is nothing short of a provocative act against the League of Nations and at the same time a serious warning to Poland."

<p>The price of gold in London soared again this morning, listed at 144 shillings and 11 pence, 10 pence higher than Saturday. This is due to the easing of the pound sterling.</p>
<p>The London silver market was quite volatile today before listing. It was predicted that it would rise by 0.0625, but the listed price for spot was 28 pence 4375, the same as the previous price, while futures were 28 pence 5625, up 0.0625. India and China were both buying and selling in the morning. The closing price was stable.</p>
<p>The Bombay silver market was also calm today. The opening price for spot was 68 rupees, 2 annas higher than the closing price on Saturday. There was no change until 12:15, and the market was lackluster.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>British-American The rise in the price of gold national currency at the close of trading on Saturday, which was caused by the increased trust in the gold national currency's ability to protect its currency, has not subsided this morning. However, the foreign exchange market is generally quite quiet. Operators who rushed to exchange their gold coins for pounds sterling at the end of last week are no longer as panicked as before, so the demand for pounds sterling has eased slightly. For this reason, the pound sterling is now weak in terms of gold coins and US dollars. The opening exchange rate between British and American was $4.8225, 0.125 lower than the closing price of the US-British exchange rate on Saturday. There was a slight improvement in the morning, but it stagnated slightly at noon. The price at 2:00 PM in the afternoon was $4.83125, 0.875 higher than the opening. The market was relatively quiet. Also, one US dollar is equivalent to four shillings and one penny 676 in British gold.</p>
<p>British-French The opening price was 73 francs 15, 50 points lower than the closing price on Saturday. It rose slightly at 11:00, but returned to the opening price at noon. The price jumped up 10 points at 2:00 PM in the afternoon to 73 francs 25.</p>
<p>US-British The pound sterling fell slightly today. The opening exchange rate between US and British was $4.83125, down 0.125. The fluctuations were narrow, and the market was calm.</p>
<p>US-French The rise in gold coins on Saturday reappeared slightly today. The opening exchange rate between US and French was $6.59375, 0.375 higher than the closing price on Saturday.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>New York Cotton The cotton market opened about 5 points higher, but within the first hour, almost all of the gains were lost, and the market turned quiet with very sluggish trading. The currency price fluctuations seemed to be subsiding, and one element of manipulating the market price in the cotton market was thus eliminated. In terms of weather, there was rain in the eastern cotton belt, but it was not what the cotton farmers needed. The pressure of counter-donation is now increasing daily. There are rumors that someone has advised the president to exercise his privileges to abolish this donation.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat The opening was about one point higher. The market price of grain in Winnipeg rose, and the dry area narrowed. However, the statistical position is conducive to higher prices.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton Today there is a more stable trend. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the asking price for July futures was 6.13, 6 points higher than the closing price on Saturday.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat The market price was slightly lower today because those who profited from the price increase on Saturday sold off, and the Chicago wheat market also fell at the close of trading on Saturday. At 1:00 PM in the afternoon, the price for July futures was 5 shillings and 7 pence, 0.125 lower than on Saturday.</p>
<p>Bombay Cotton Market The price rose slightly today, but the market was quiet. The price of Bai Luozhi cotton for July-August futures was 222 rupees, 2 rupees higher than on Saturday. This price did not move before noon.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London The opening was stable today, with prices the same as the closing price on Saturday, but the atmosphere was weaker before noon. At noon, the transaction price for July-September futures was 5 pence 5 holes 25, down 0.0625. The market was quiet after the price fell.</p>
<p>New York The opening today fell by 20 points due to the drop in prices in London. Within half an hour of the opening, the downward trend did not stop. The rubber market seems to be entirely controlled by foreign markets. Although various domestic markets are now strong, they have no impact on the rubber market. Merchants are all taking a wait-and-see attitude.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York Except for the considerable pressure on railway stocks and retail sales of public utility stocks, the general price of the securities market this morning was higher than before. The atmosphere turned better at the opening, and the market was firm. The resistance to profit-taking discovered on Saturday has made the foothold more stable. Today, everyone feels that if there is any news that is slightly beneficial to the market, it can promote an upward trend in prices, but there is no exciting general news. Within half an hour of the opening, the pressure on railway and public utility stocks no longer existed. The slight increase at the opening gradually expanded and rose by one or two points. The market is still active, and the atmosphere is also stable. The New York securities market prices are listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Severe Wind Disaster in the Southern United States: The Town of Crossroads Completely Destroyed; Thousands Left Homeless</h3>
<p>Jackson, Mississippi: A hurricane struck Mississippi and Louisiana today, killing 33 people, seriously injuring 200, and leaving thousands homeless, with tens of millions of dollars in property damage. Among the 33 deaths, 10 were people who went boating on the Mississippi River at the end of the week and encountered a storm. The boat capsized in the middle of the river, and all were drowned. The small town of Crossroads, with a population of 1,200, was completely destroyed, killing 12 and injuring 100, with serious injuries. The hurricane blew down church spires, houses, warehouses, and other three-dimensional buildings, broke trees, telegraph and telephone lines, and cut off electricity. More than a dozen other small towns were also severely damaged. Most parts of the state and Louisiana were affected by the wind disaster. The state's Red Cross and other charitable organizations quickly mobilized, earning the praise of the people. Airplanes, trains, and cars loaded with food, tents, medicine, doctors, and nurses rushed to Crossroads and other disaster areas. As of now, 33 deaths have been learned of here, but the number of deaths will inevitably increase greatly after reports from all parties are gathered. (National Telegraph, 7th)</p>
<h3>Hurricane Passes Through the Philippines: Trees Uprooted, Houses Collapsed, and Transportation Disrupted</h3>
<p>(Manila) Southern Luzon still has a hurricane today, with 4 deaths and thousands of houses destroyed. Samar and Leyte provinces had the strongest winds, and it is reported that 1,000 houses were blown down in Albay province. Details of the disaster are still lacking due to transportation disruptions. Roads everywhere are blocked by fallen trees and telephone poles. (National Telegraph, 8th)</p>
<h3>Devaluation of Dutch and Swiss Currencies: Only a Matter of Time</h3>
<p>(London) After the Dutch authorities tried their best to protect the Dutch guilder, short sellers covered their positions in advance, causing the Dutch and Swiss currencies to rise. However, it is the general opinion here today that the Netherlands and Switzerland will eventually follow in the footsteps of Belgium and reduce the value of their currencies. This is only a matter of time because the currencies of these two countries are very vulnerable to attack due to their weak economic situation. If the Dutch guilder is devalued, what will happen to rubber? It is expected that the Dutch government will take this opportunity to levy an export tax on the Dutch East Indies. A rubber industry expert said that if the Dutch currency is devalued, the price of rubber from the natives of the Dutch East Indies will inevitably be high, and the production of native rubber will inevitably increase greatly. Therefore, the authorities should increase the existing export tax in proportion to the degree of currency devaluation. This method must be implemented immediately after the currency is devalued. The Dutch guilder has only a temporary impact on rubber because rubber is actually tied to US consumption in the summer and autumn, and the amount of US consumption will depend on the outcome of the US employment case.

<h3>1934: Record Flow of Gold to the United States; Two Reasons</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to a statement released by the Department of Commerce today, the flow of gold into the United States in 1934 created a new record. There are two reasons for the huge influx of gold into the United States: (1) Funds exported in 1933 were returned to the country, (2) Exports exceeded imports by $478,000,000 in 1934. Government experts said that the political situation in some gold bloc countries is unstable, and they have transported cash here to seek safety. Therefore, there is a huge amount of gold imported into the United States. The total value of gold imported in 1934 was $1,187,000,000, and the value of gold exported was only $53,000,000, a net increase of $1,134,000,000. The report also stated that the total value of silver imported into the United States in 1934 was $103,000,000, and the value of silver exported was $17,000,000, a net increase of $86,000,000.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Urges Provinces to Abolish Onerous Taxes</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) A certain official of the Ministry of Finance said that the situation in each province regarding the abolition of onerous taxes is quite inconsistent. There are indeed many provinces that have fully complied, but there are still a small number of provinces that have not been able to achieve this on schedule. For the sake of supervision, the government intends to formulate restrictive measures. Provinces that completely abolish onerous taxes will be allocated 40% of the stamp tax revenue each month according to the amount. Otherwise, the allocation will be temporarily suspended. Recently, a small number of local authorities have complained that the designated subsidies have not been issued. It is not known that the central government's subsidies are safely stored in the national treasury. If the local authorities abolish the taxes quickly, they will be able to quickly obtain them, which is not a problem. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Finance Tentatively Drafts Measures to Unify Paper Money</h3>

(2) In order to regulate rural finance, various auxiliary currency notes of less than one yuan will be temporarily issued by provincial banks or local banks. 60% of the reserve cash should be prepared, and 40% of the guarantee money should be prepared, but 20% of the cash can be replaced by warehouse receipts. (3) If provincial banks or local banks have already issued exchange notes of one yuan or more, the Ministry of Finance will investigate the amount and order them to be withdrawn. Before the withdrawal, the exchange notes of the Central Bank will be used as reserve funds and handed over to the Central Bank for safekeeping. (Special Dispatch, 8th)</p>

<h3>After Chairman Chiang Arrived in Guizhou, Guiyang Took on a New Look. The Central Army Implemented the New Life Movement. Chairman Chiang Strove for Construction and Industry.</h3>
<p>A Guiyang dispatch from the Zi Lin Daily on April 1st states that Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and his wife arrived here by plane on March 24th, greatly exciting the local officials and attracting the attention of the people. In recent years, no high-ranking officials of the central government have visited Guizhou. Now that such an important figure has arrived, the entire city is decorated with flags and banners to express welcome. Moreover, because Chairman Chiang is the advocate of the New Life Movement, the entire city has been cleaned and renovated in recent days, taking on a new look.</p>
<p>When the communist bandits were not far from the provincial capital and the provincial army was plotting to loot the entire city and retreat the next day, the central army suddenly arrived, and the local area was saved from danger. At first, the shops were half-closed, and the shopkeepers secretly hid their valuables, waiting for the disaster to descend. Unexpectedly, a savior arrived, and they were as happy and excited as schoolchildren. The provincial army was particularly displeased, as it missed a great opportunity. From then on, the shops were fully open, the streets were thoroughly cleaned, and the atmosphere completely changed. The central army also took on the role of street police, and their treatment of the people was kind, unlike any previous soldiers. The New Life Movement was immediately launched in the army, and people in specially made uniforms were sent to guide the people on the streets. These people did not carry weapons, only batons, but they did not strike the backs of the ignorant villagers.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has patrolled the city many times and consulted with various senior officials, paying attention to the overall situation in the province. The province is permeated with opium smoke, and many people are addicted to opium. Chairman Chiang is now eager to eliminate this scourge, but during conversations, he expressed that the habit is deeply ingrained and that unless farmers are first helped to change to other crops and addicts are helped to quit, it is impossible to suddenly issue a ban on planting and smoking. He later stated during a conversation that the urgent task today is to completely change the nation's concept of employing people and engaging in productive work. In other words, it is necessary to develop natural resources and improve agriculture.</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek always pursues a policy of building roads and developing remote areas, and it is the same when he arrives here. Chiang ordered in Chongqing to complete the highways from Chongqing to northern Guizhou and from Changsha to Guizhou as soon as possible. Roads are currently being built here to the north of the province to connect with Chongqing. Chiang also believes that it is now urgent to develop small industries to utilize natural products. About eighty or ninety miles from here, there is a 300-foot-high waterfall, which can be used to generate electricity to supply the entire province. Although Guiyang has a small power plant, electricity is only available from 7:00 PM to 12:00 AM every night, and only a few intersections in the city are equipped with electric lights. The rest of the roads and most of the residences are dark at night. In addition, transportation is difficult, and the price of kerosene is extremely high. Ordinary people cannot afford to buy it, so as soon as it gets dark, every family closes their doors and goes to bed, and there are few people on the road. The province is rich in coal, but it contains sulfur. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek knows that this is a type of industry that can be developed, as it can supply the grease used for road construction, or even refined into gasoline, and its by-products can be used to make pigments. Chiang also feels that it is now appropriate to purchase chemical fertilizers on a large scale to increase agricultural production, and to use barren mountains for animal husbandry. The Miao people are quite knowledgeable in this area, so their cattle and sheep thrive. Chiang's flight here has made him deeply aware of the difficulties of traveling here, so he intends to prioritize the development of transportation. In the past, traveling by bridge from Chongqing to here took seventeen days. Now, by plane, it only takes two hours. When the highway is built, if it remains flat, it will only take two days to arrive. The province is extremely rich in minerals, but they are all abandoned on the ground. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has stated that he intends to conduct investigations to plan for mining.</p>
<p>Since the arrival of the central army in the province, the communist bandits have been defeated and are now being pursued. It will not be difficult to eliminate them completely in the near future.</p>
<h3>Xiamen Municipal Government Established: Inauguration Ceremony Held on the First. Siming County Government Simultaneously Abolished. Heshan Established as a Special District Office</h3>
<p>Xiamen correspondence: The proposal to establish a municipality in Xiamen has been going on for nine years. The idea of establishing a municipality was conceived as early as when the Navy governed Xiamen in the 16th year of the Republic of China. Later, after several changes, it was never realized. After the 19th Route Army entered Fujian, the proposal to establish a municipality was re-raised, and a Siming City Preparatory Office was established, planning to abolish Siming County and establish Siming City on the entire island of Xiamen. Subsequently, the Executive Yuan ordered the Ministry of Interior, Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and Ministry of Navy to review the matter. As a result, the municipality was still limited to the scope of the Xiamen Public Security Bureau's police district, and the villages in Heshan outside the city still belonged to Siming County. This was because Xiamen was a commercial port with a mix of Chinese and foreigners, while Heshan belonged to the interior. Once it was included in the urban area, foreigners would use this as an excuse to break into the inland areas of Heshan. Moreover, Xiamen had a naval port command and fortress artillery, which were solid fortress defense areas. Therefore, the 19th Route Army used the director of the city preparatory office to concurrently serve as the county magistrate of Enming County to unify administration. This lasted throughout the period of the 19th Route Army, but the municipality was never established. During the puppet people's government era, a Xiamen municipal government was once established, but it was short-lived. After the Fujian Incident was quelled, the provincial government abolished the city preparatory office and established the Xiamen Special Public Security Bureau, which was a disguised municipal government in its rudimentary form, with Wang Gupan serving as the director and concurrently as the county magistrate of Siming. Later, the organization of the Special Public Security Bureau was reported to the Executive Yuan, but it was rejected by the Executive Yuan's meeting. Last winter, the provincial government again proposed the establishment of a municipality, which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. However, the area was still limited to the current police district. The Siming County Government was abolished, and Heshan was placed under the jurisdiction of Tong'an County. However, Xiamen Island is 30 li long and wide and 100 li in circumference, with a very large area. In addition to the city streets in the police district, which are several li long and wide, the rest originally belonged to the jurisdiction of the Siming County Government. The so-called Heshan is actually the entire island of Xiamen outside the police district. Tong'an County is separated by the sea, making jurisdiction inconvenient. Later, it was decided to change Heshan into a special district directly under the provincial government. On March 19th, the Executive Yuan approved Governor Chen Yi's request to appoint Wang Gupan as the mayor of Xiamen. Wang immediately went to the province to ask for instructions. The provincial government also ordered Wang to concurrently serve as the director of the Xiamen Public Security Bureau. Wang returned to Xiamen on the 29th, and the municipal government was established on April 1st.</p>
<p>The inauguration ceremony of the Xiamen Municipal Government was held at 10:00 AM on April 1st in the old Siming County Government. Foreign and Chinese guests were present, including consuls from Britain, the United States, Japan, and other countries stationed in Xiamen, Zhan Tiaoyuan and Chen Lianfen from the provincial party headquarters, Yao Juyuan and Wang Zhengmin from the county party headquarters, Naval Port Commander Lin Guogeng, Customs Superintendent Dai Ensai, and various institutions, chambers of commerce, and other organizations. First, Wang Gupan reported on the establishment process of the municipal government, followed by speeches by Zhan Tiaoyuan, Chen Lianfen, Lin Guogeng, and Hong Hongru, chairman of the chamber of commerce. Next, the Japanese consul and the British consul gave speeches. After the speeches, the ceremony was completed and the meeting adjourned. As for the Siming County Government, it was concluded and abolished on March 31st. The Heshan Special District Office was also established on the 1st. Wang Chengzhang, captain of the 2nd Marine Police Brigade, received an order from the provincial government to take over the county government and the county public security bureau, temporarily serving as the director of the district office. In addition to Wang Gupan concurrently serving as the director of the Public Security Bureau, the municipal government officials were announced on the same day: Yang Tingyu as the director of the Public Works Bureau, Shen Jing as the director of the Finance Bureau, Wang Zhengmin as the director of the 1st Section, Zheng Yongxiang as the director of the 2nd Section, and Ma Shaowen as the secretary. Also, Ma Shaowen concurrently serves as the chief of the general affairs section in the Public Security Bureau, Ye Bofu as the chief of the administrative section, Xu Chongyue as the chief of the judicial section, and Wang Zhaoduan as the chief of the health section. The organization of the municipal government is in accordance with the organizational outline approved by the provincial government. Originally, the municipal government was to have one bureau and three sections, namely the Public Security Bureau, the 1st Section (Finance), the 2nd Section (Public Utilities), and the 3rd Section (Social Affairs and Education). It was later changed to three bureaus and two sections, namely the Public Security Bureau, the Finance Bureau (formerly the 1st Section), the Public Works Bureau (formerly the 2nd Section), the 1st Section (Social Affairs), and the 2nd Section (Education), which were split from the original 3rd Section. (April 4th)</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Dredging the Huangtian Port with Annual Earnings</h3>
<p>The Jiangyin County Government has organized a dredging committee to be responsible for dredging the Huangtian Port waterway. The required cost is 160,000 yuan. In addition to the more than 60,000 yuan raised by the county, there is still a shortage of more than 90,000 yuan, which is impossible to raise. Therefore, Yan Puquan, the county magistrate of the county, and Wu Shuying, the chairman of the chamber of commerce, came to Wuxi together to borrow from the local silver merchants. The Wuxi Chamber of Commerce once invited representatives of various banks to discuss it at a meeting, but it did not produce results due to the extremely tight financial situation. However, the river is very important for the water conservancy and transportation of Xicheng, so at 10 o'clock yesterday (8th) morning, the Xiamen Chamber of Commerce invited representatives from nine banks, including China, Transportation, Jiangsu, Industry, Mainland, Xingye, Tongshang, Zhongnan, and Shanghai, to discuss it again. Representatives Wu Shuying, Gong Yinzeng, Han Xie'an, and Gu Haojia also came from Jiangyin. As a result of the discussion, it was decided that each bank would lend 4,000 yuan, totaling 36,000 yuan. In the future, the county will use the special construction funds from the province and county to repay it. The county will find a way to raise the remaining insufficient amount.</p>
<h3>Eight-Year-Old Child Tragically Run Over and Killed by a Car</h3>
<p>Ji Xuewen, a wheat purchasing agent at the Jiufeng Flour Mill, was marrying off his daughter yesterday (8th). The day before, the wedding dress was being tried on at the Railway Hotel, and his relative Tong Zizhen's family went to congratulate him. Tong Ziyansheng, only eight years old, happened to be playing at the entrance of the hotel when an unexpected tragedy occurred. Suddenly, a Rongtai car sped around the corner and knocked Ziyansheng down. The wheels ran over his head, crushing his skull. The patrol police immediately detained the driver Lin Fushou and sent him to the 6th Branch of the Public Security Bureau. They also sent the injured person to the Brothers Hospital for treatment. Unfortunately, he was too badly injured and died shortly after. Afterwards, after repeated persuasion, the father of the deceased, Tong Zizhen, immediately put the body in a coffin and went to the county court to request an exemption from examination. He said that the dead cannot be brought back to life, so he would not make excessive demands. The driver Lin Fushou, who caused the accident, will be dealt with by the official authorities.</p>
<h3>Robbery and Injury in Rural Areas</h3>
<p>Cai Axing, a resident of Caijiaqiao in Dongqiao Town, 7th District, is a farmer and also sells bricks, tiles, and lime as a side business. His family of several people is barely able to make ends meet. Unexpectedly, at about 10:00 PM the night before, more than a dozen robbers suddenly came, each armed with pistols and other weapons. They first tied up the victim and burned his skin with fire, forcing him to reveal the location of his hidden silver. Then, they ransacked the chests and cabinets, looting at will. After about an hour, they escaped with their stolen goods, estimated at a loss of 170 to 180 yuan. Also, Gu Jinda, a villager in Daqiangmenkou Township, 8th District, was robbed the night before, with a loss of more than 300 yuan.</p>
<h3>Changshu: Rice Industry Strike Resolved</h3>
<p>The rice industry in this county experienced a strike because the Finance Department sent official Liu Xiang to Changshu to investigate accounts and increase business tax, which led to a conflict with Taifeng Rice Firm. A single misspoken word escalated into a full-scale strike, causing an immediate shortage of food. Prices in the Shanghai market soared, reaching over one yuan per stone. Rice milling operations here also ceased work, joining the turmoil. Subsequently, County Magistrate Zhai, along with Party Committee members Wu Zhongying and An Weinan, and Chamber of Commerce Chairman Pang Jiegong, personally went to the Rice Guild to persuade them. Finally, on the 7th, the entire industry temporarily resumed operations, bringing this turbulent event to a conclusion. As for the rice merchants' request to reduce taxes, the Chamber of Commerce and the Business Tax Bureau will explore alternative solutions.</p>
<h3>Yangzhou: Yangzhou City Strike Calmed</h3>
<p>A dispute arose between the Jiangdu Business Tax Bureau and the candle, charcoal, cloth, and incense industries due to account investigations, leading to the detention of shop employees. This sparked a reaction from 35 other industries. Although Commissioner Yan Shudong from the Provincial Department and members of the Chamber of Commerce intervened to mediate, a satisfactory resolution could not be reached. As a result, the detained employees of the Zhen Da, Baofeng, and Yufeng companies were not immediately released. Shop employees from various industries collectively called for rescue and petitioned the Party and government organs, but to no avail. Consequently, they declared a work slowdown. Capitalists also gathered to discuss providing strong support, and on the 7th, a unified general strike was declared to resist. Fearing this would affect social tranquility, the Party Headquarters and the County Government sent a letter requesting the County Chamber of Commerce to persuade the businesses to resume operations. A mediation meeting was held at the Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM on the 7th, attended by Commissioner Yan, County Magistrate Ma, Standing Committee members Yu and Zhang from the Party Headquarters' Executive and Supervisory Committee, Director Song of the Business Tax Bureau, all Executive and Supervisory Committee members of the Chamber of Commerce, and over 40 representatives from labor and management of various industries. County Magistrate Ma first expressed his views: (1) Those arrested would be released on bail, guaranteed by the County Party Headquarters; (2) All businesses must resume operations to prevent escalation; (3) They must abide by regulations and submit to account investigations, and if there are difficulties, they can request leniency. Subsequently, five resolutions were decided upon: (1) The County Government and Business Tax Bureau will jointly send personnel to assist with account investigations; (2) All businesses will resume operations starting from the 8th; (3) Omitted; (4) After the account investigations, local organizations will petition the Provincial Department for tax reductions; (5) In the future, shop employees shall not be arbitrarily arrested without cause. All attendees signed the above five resolutions. Representatives from various industries expressed satisfaction with the above resolutions. After the meeting, all labor representatives went to the County Government to welcome the arrested employees back to their stores.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Xiang Zhizhuang's Inspection of Troops</h3>
<p>The spring inspection of the security teams of various counties in the Nantong District will be held in Nantong. Xiang Zhizhuang, Director of the Jiangsu Provincial Security Department, is scheduled to arrive in Nantong on the 9th. In addition to the graduating cadets of the second class of the district security team leader training course, the teams to be inspected this time include four platoons each from Nantong and Rugao, two platoons from Haimen, and one platoon each from Jingjiang, Qidong, and Chongming, as well as three platoons from the Industrial Security Team.</p>
<h3>Hangzhou: Suicide of Vice President of the Red Swastika Society</h3>
<p>Liu Daosheng, 73 years old, from Nanjing, Vice President and Vice Executive of the Southeast General Branch of the World Red Swastika Society, was recently assigned to Hangzhou to attend the Zhejiang Provincial Buddhist Association. He resided in room 81 of the Juying Hotel in the Xinshichang area. At 9:00 PM on the 7th, he took a rickshaw from the court to the lakeside, purchased lotus root flour and cigarettes, and asked the rickshaw puller to deliver them to the hotel. He then slowly walked to the Kaiyuan Bridge, where he suddenly suffered a nervous breakdown and jumped into the lake to commit suicide. Fortunately, a police officer heard the alarm, rescued him, and sent him to the relevant Public Security Bureau for questioning. He was ordered to return to the hotel to rest.</p>
<h3>Audit Office Guardhouse Fire</h3>
<p>At 10:30 AM on the 7th, a fire suddenly broke out in the guardhouse of the Liangzhe Salt Affairs Audit Office in Jin Yazhuang, Hangzhou, due to an electrical fault. Fire brigades and community fire rescue teams rushed to put out the blaze, which was eventually extinguished. An estimated three rooms of single-story buildings were burned down, with losses of approximately one thousand yuan. During the fire, several rows of guns and ammunition could not be evacuated in time and detonated, but fortunately, no one was injured.</p>

<h3>Art Exhibition Preview Opens Yesterday - Over a Thousand Chinese and Western Visitors</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai preview of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art opened at 9:00 AM yesterday. Despite the severe weather, Chinese and Western visitors continued to arrive in succession. Among them, quite a few traveled from afar specifically to view and study various Chinese artworks. It is expected that when the weather improves today and tomorrow, even more visitors will attend. The situation yesterday is reported as follows:</p>
<p>Exhibits of Incalculable Value</p>
<p>Many of the antiques displayed at the exhibition are of incalculable value. Bronzes from the Shang and Zhou dynasties serve as ironclad evidence of China's earliest civilization. As for calligraphy and painting, they integrate works from various schools throughout history into one place, which should be effective for those studying this art form to achieve a thorough understanding. Moreover, various paintings, purely representative of Eastern flavor and not influenced by Western painting schools like modern Chinese paintings, will be even more impressive to people in London when exhibited there in the future. Furthermore, works such as Dong Beiyuan's "Dragon's Stay in Suburban Village" and Guo Xi's "Clearing Snow on Peaks" are all breathtaking. In particular, Emperor Qianlong's authentic works and Emperor Shizu's ink Zhong Kui are rarely seen outside, so attendees admire them endlessly.</p>
<p>Extracting the Essence to Glimpse the Whole Picture</p>
<p>Most of the antiques are selected from the Palace Museum and the Antiquities Exhibition Hall. In the past, when these antiques were displayed in the Palace Museum, each ticket cost one yuan, and it took three days to walk through all the palaces to see the whole picture. Now, extracting the essence and integrating the antiques sent by the Academia Sinica, the Peking Library, the Henan Museum, and the Anhui Provincial Library for exhibition, one can browse all of them in one day. This is much more economical in terms of both time and money.</p>
<p>Wang Shijie Summons Senior Personnel for Discussion</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, Minister of Education Wang Shijie visited the exhibition again and summoned senior personnel for discussion. The content concerned future preview arrangements and issues related to the shipment of antiques to England. Mr. Wang left the exhibition at 12:00 PM.</p>
<p>Adding Ticket Sales Points for More Convenience</p>
<p>Previously, to maintain order, the exhibition planned not to sell tickets at the entrance. Now, for the convenience of the audience, temporary ticket sales points have been set up at the entrance, as well as at various offices of the Bank of China and branches of the Shanghai Bank. Therefore, it will be more convenient for those who plan to visit in the future to purchase tickets.</p>
<p>Consulting Bilingual Catalogs</p>
<p>To facilitate the audience's participation in the explanation and browsing of antiques, the exhibition has specially printed detailed catalogs in both Chinese and English. The Chinese version costs five jiao (cents) of silver for printing costs, and the English version costs one yuan of silver. Both the appearance and content are very beautiful and substantial. In total, over a thousand copies of each language version were sold yesterday. The Commercial Press, which printed the books, is being urged to deliver them. People outside of Shanghai who wish to purchase the catalogs can also send payment to the exhibition.</p>
<p>Over Two Thousand Visitors Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday, over two thousand people visited the exhibition, half of whom were Chinese and foreign men and women. All had a high degree of appreciation for art, so they often discussed and elaborated on it. Foreigners especially praised calligraphy, painting, and kesi silk tapestries. The exhibition specifically displayed Chinese porcelain, famous worldwide, in a systematic manner starting from the Song Dynasty Ding Kiln, up to the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty. The progress of porcelain bodies, glazes, coloring, and patterns was particularly interesting.</p>
<p>Ye Gongchuo's Opinion on the Art Exhibition</p>
<p>Ye Gongchuo recently published his opinion on the "London International Exhibition of Chinese Art," which is worthy of reference for those who visit the exhibition. His opinion is transcribed as follows: "Our country's art and fine arts and crafts have always been world-renowned (except for a few people who lack understanding). However, our country has always lacked large-scale exhibition halls and specialized research institutions. Therefore, systematic collection, preservation, display, sorting, and circulation are all lacking. As a result, ordinary people who want to study our country's art often have no way to start and have to seek books written by foreigners and museums run by foreigners (although the Palace Museum and the Antiquities Exhibition Hall have many collections, their organization is not yet ready, so they cannot fully meet this need). Although our country's participation in the London International Exhibition of Our Country's Art this time may not achieve any major goals, it is enough to make ordinary people increase their understanding of our country's art or re-evaluate its value, so it is still a meaningful move. Opening a preview before going abroad to allow domestic people to have the opportunity to visit and study first is also a very appropriate method. There is a lot of discussion about the entire preparation process of this exhibition, but in all fairness, it is still an innovation for our country to handle such matters, so we cannot demand perfection. The most regrettable things seem to be two points: (1) Due to limitations on public products and various reasons, it is not possible to freely select them sufficiently. Therefore, there are doubts as to whether the products can represent the entirety of our country's art. (2) Due to various reasons, the products cannot be organized into a systematic and meaningful structure, which inevitably lacks the meaning of 'history.' Therefore, it is sufficient for appreciation but slightly lacks the function of research. The causes of these two are also very complicated, so I will not elaborate on them for now. I only hope that the authorities will solicit the opinions of experts more when handling such matters in the future before proceeding. It is also necessary to prepare sufficient time and not hand in the papers in a hurry at the last minute. If exhibiting abroad, it is even more necessary to know oneself and the enemy, and carefully determine the plan and steps, so as to avoid improper responses and wasting financial resources. That's all. As for this exhibition, it can generally be divided into six categories: calligraphy and painting, porcelain, bronze, silk embroidery, lacquerware, and jade. The total number of calligraphy and painting is 163 pieces. The Palace Museum accounts for eight tenths of the products. The rest are the products of the Antiquities Exhibition Hall. In my personal opinion, I wish to fully select and send representative calligraphy and paintings from various schools throughout history to show the truth about our country's calligraphy and painting schools. However, in fact, the calligraphy and paintings of these two institutions are not complete in all schools (there are also some that are not good). The standards for selection by each person cannot be completely consistent. There are also other facts that must be bound. Therefore, the result is like the currently selected catalog. This catalog has been approved by Chinese and British experts and reviewed by the preparatory committee. Although I dare not say that all the fine products of our country's calligraphy and painting are prepared here, it can be asserted that there is no inferior thing in this catalog. As for the works of each family, there are some that cannot represent the achievements of their lives, such as Mi Nan Gong and Zhao Ziang's paintings, which are not their most exquisite works. This is limited by the facts and there is nothing that can be done about it (the Palace Museum lost a lot of collections one after another before the Qing Dynasty. After the Republic of China, even more were lost before Puyi left the palace. Even Puyi's list of rewards alone included more than 1,800 pieces of calligraphy and painting, all of which were the essence of the Six Dynasties, Tang, Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties). However, famous dramatic works such as Dong Beiyuan's "Dragon's Stay in Suburban Village" and Guo Xi's "Clearing Snow on Peaks" are all breathtaking and sufficient to overwhelm everything. The Qing Palace's collection of porcelain is more complete than other items. This time, after Mr. Guo Baochang carefully selected them in Beijing and re-examined them in Shanghai, the products are excellent, and the styles of various kilns of all dynasties are roughly complete. It is estimated that domestic and foreign collections will never be so complete. It is a pity that the pottery and porcelain before the Song Dynasty were not collected. This is also due to the limitations of the Palace Museum. There are not many bronzes exhibited this time. Judging from the quality and quantity of the various utensils unearthed recently, this product is not enough to represent them. However, our country's research on bronzes has always emphasized writing, followed by style and patterns. In terms of writing, this type of product is also very impressive. In addition, silk embroideries include various Song Dynasty kesi silk tapestries, including landscapes, figures, flowers, and birds. They are truly spectacular (this type of kesi silk is rarely seen in the South). The kesi silk of the Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties is also a fine product. Kesi silk embroidery was originally unique to the South, but it has now declined and been lost. It is a pity (there are still people in Mudu, Suzhou who can make kesi silk, and embroidery workers in Jiangsu, Hunan, and Guangdong are famous, but in fact, they are far inferior to the past). As for carved lacquerware, there are Yongle, Xuande, Jiajing, and Qianlong of the Ming Dynasty and Qianlong of the Qing Dynasty. Jade articles are mostly better in workmanship. If you want to study our country's ancient jade, you cannot rely on the Palace Museum's collections as data. Most Chinese people know this, so there is no need to repeat it. This London exhibition seeks Chinese artworks collected by various countries, not specifically from our country. Many of our country's artworks have flowed abroad over the years, and what we have may not be as good as others. If we intend to compete, we must actively organize in advance. However, the organizations of our country's public and private institutions are mostly unsound, and it is very difficult for them to gather and act. After this time, the Chinese people will increase their awareness and experience, and there will be good hopes in the future. Furthermore, in recent times, those who reject spiritual civilization often say that what is needed today is material construction. Anything else is not urgent. They do not take the preservation of antiques seriously. They do not know that the national spirit of a country is often tied to past cultural relics. Therefore, from Soviet Russia on the left to Italy on the right, all arts and fine arts are extremely promoted and protected. However, their purpose is different from our country's past practice of only providing for personal enjoyment. Therefore, our country should quickly build mass art, preserve and promote inherent art as the foundation, and not only provide for personal enjoyment or blindly destroy things. This is also what I hope from the audience of the preview, who will be inspired by the wind."</p>
<p>English Name Slightly Changed</p>
<p>The advertisement published by the exhibition in the English-language North-China Daily News and the China Press was originally The Preliminary Exhibition of The London Exhibition of Chinese Art. The four committee members specially sent to China by the United Kingdom believed that the scope was too broad and requested that it be changed to ... of Chinese National Treasures Selected for The International Exhibibition of Chinese in London 1935-36. The exhibition has agreed and instructed the above two newspapers to correct it today.</p>
<p>An Expert Talks About the Selection Process</p>
<p>A reporter from the New Voice News Agency met with an expert who participated in the selection yesterday morning. According to the discussion, many of the items on display this time are very precious. Among them, Shang and Zhou bronzes are treasures in our country's history and are unparalleled among the world's antiques. Porcelain from famous kilns of the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties is also a special product of our country. Because porcelain is inconvenient to carry, less of it has flowed abroad. This exhibition in England is still an innovation. Ancient books are the world's earliest printed books and are especially valuable. The Peking Library originally did not allow ancient books to participate. After repeated requests from the preparatory committee, they finally agreed to transport them here. As for ancient calligraphy and paintings, because many have flowed out, foreigners have a good ability to identify them. The five experts sent by the United Kingdom were extremely strict in selecting them. They used microscopes to examine all paintings on silk. A British expert recognized a pot shape in a certain ancient painting from the Southern Song Dynasty as a Qing object and suspected that it was not genuine, so it was rejected. However, foreigners are superstitious about emperors and only selected those with Emperor Qianlong and Jiaqing's imperial seals, which led to the failure of some famous paintings to be selected. As for the works of Lang Shining, the preparatory committee believed that Lang was a Westerner and could not represent our country's culture, so they planned not to select them. Later, at the request of the British Committee, two paintings were selected. As for the jade articles, they were relatively inferior.</p>
<h3>Zhang Fakui Visits This Newspaper Yesterday, Hosted by Ma Yinliang</h3>
<p>Former Commander of the Fourth Army, Mr. Zhang Fakui, has been traveling around Europe and the United States, investigating various political, economic, military, and social aspects for nearly three years. After returning to China on the 12th of last month, he made a brief stay in Shanghai and is quite concerned about various social undertakings. Yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM, Mr. Zhang, accompanied by Chen Jitang's representatives Yang Dezhao, Chen Zhuohong, Zhu Buyun, and other gentlemen, came to visit this newspaper. They were hosted by the manager of this newspaper, Ma Yinliang, who accompanied them to visit various departments such as business, distribution, editing, and printing machinery. Mr. Zhang inquired in detail about the history and distribution of this newspaper. Mr. Zhang believes that the number of newspaper readers in our country is not universal compared to European and American countries, and hopes that the people of the country will work hard to promote education so that all the people in the country can have the possibility of holding a newspaper in their hands, and then the country can be strong.</p>

<h3>British Minister Returns North Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>British Minister to China, Sir J.T. Pratt, came to Shanghai a few days ago to attend the Shanghai preview of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art. The minister's banquet was held yesterday afternoon. The Shanghai-Peiping train departed at 4:00 PM, and he left Shanghai to return north.</p>
<h3>Aviator Sun Tonggang Sails to Italy Tomorrow, Various Circles Host Farewell Banquet Yesterday Afternoon</h3>
<p>Youthful aviator Sun Tonggang, who flew a monoplane back to his motherland from Germany last year, was warmly welcomed by people across the country. Recently, in order to seek further study, he plans to go to Italy to continue studying aeronautical engineering. This time, he went to Jinjing via Jinan to complete the formalities for going abroad, which has already been completed. He arrived in Shanghai by the Beijing-Shanghai train the day before yesterday and stayed at the New Asia Hotel.</p>
<p>Public Farewell Banquet from Various Circles</p>
<p>The various circles of this city and all members of the Heng Society specially hosted a farewell banquet at the Atlantic Hotel yesterday afternoon. Over 200 people attended, including Du Yuesheng, Jin Tingsun, Yuan Ludeng, Wang Yansong, Yu Qiaqing, Lu Jingshi, and Zhu Xuefan. The banquet was chaired by Du Yuesheng. During the banquet, Zhu Xuefan delivered a speech on behalf of the attendees, stating that Mr. Sun is a promising talent in our country's aviation industry. This trip to Italy for study will surely enable him to serve the country when he returns after completing his studies. Next, guest Wang Yansong gave a speech, stating that Mr. Sun is going to Italy to investigate and introduce the spirit of foreign science to the country, and will surely make great contributions in the future. Mr. Yuesheng has been sparing no effort in promoting aviation and has especially supported Comrade Sun. In the future, it is hoped that Comrade Sun will continue to work hard together with the spirit promoted by Mr. Yuesheng, and the future is boundless. Next, Yuan Ludeng gave a speech, stating that in the past, traffic was inconvenient, so the evolution of the country was slow. Since the invention of the airplane, there has been an amazing development in transportation. Foreign science is developed, so progress is very fast, while our country is lagging behind. This is all caused by the lack of good talents. Mr. Sun is a good talent among young people. It is hoped that Mr. Sun will have good results after the investigation and contribute to the country. Next, Du Yuesheng gave a speech, stating that Comrade Sun's first step has been successful. This trip abroad is the second time. It is hoped that his success will be greater than the first time, so as not to disappoint those who are enthusiastic about promoting aviation. Finally, Mr. Sun gave a speech to thank everyone, and the event ended with a group photo.</p>
<p>Sailing Abroad Tomorrow</p>
<p>According to Mr. Sun yesterday, in addition to investigating aviation, he will also study the latest inventions in various scientific technologies in order to seek further study. It has now been scheduled for the 10th (ie, tomorrow - at 12 noon, he will embark on the Italian mail ship "Lotovandis"). The trip will last one year.</p>

<h3>Envoy He to Depart Tomorrow for Post</h3>
<p>Last night's farewell reception for the press, according to the Central News Agency, stated that Mr. He Yaozu, the appointed envoy to Turkey, is scheduled to depart tomorrow on the Italian mail steamer "Conte Verde" for Europe and then Turkey to take up his new post. Last night at 7 PM, at the New Asia Restaurant, he hosted a reception for the local press, attended by over fifty reporters from various newspapers and news agencies. During the dinner, Mr. He elaborated on his aspirations as an envoy in great detail. After his speech, Yan Duhe responded on behalf of the press and raised a toast to the envoy's health. The gathering adjourned around 9 PM. Mr. He's speech is recorded below: Today, I am very pleased to have this opportunity to gather with all of you. I feel I have much to say, but because I am not good at public speaking, I fear I will not be able to fully express myself. In any democratic country, public opinion is respected. Therefore, the term "public opinion" is not only receiving increasing attention from Europeans and Americans, but also from our own people more than before. As the Book of Documents says, "Heaven sees as my people see; Heaven hears as my people hear." This shows that ancient politics also valued public opinion. But further, how is public opinion expressed? Public discourse is an expression of public opinion, or at least a part of it. How is public discourse created? Who leads the people? Considering the saying, "Those who know first enlighten those who know later; those who are awakened first awaken those who are awakened later," those who create public discourse and lead the people are, of course, people with excellent knowledge and status in society. In my view, leaders in the press, due to their position and opportunities, have the greatest power to lead the people and shape public opinion. This view is not entirely based on idealism, but rather a conclusion drawn from observing the facts. For example, in the past, many unfortunate events occurred. The domestic press either adopted a passive attitude or published active commentary. The resolution of the Fujian Incident, for example, was significantly influenced by the press. This is a well-known fact and need not be elaborated. In short, the various improvements in Chinese society over the past few decades owe much to the help of public discourse. The success of any improvement is either due to the advocacy of the press beforehand, or the support of the press afterwards, enabling it to achieve twice the result with half the effort, easily. Otherwise, one will inevitably get half the result with twice the effort, and achieve little with great labor. Furthermore, the power of public discourse is not only related to the reform of domestic affairs, but also to the success or failure of diplomacy. This is true not only in China, but also in other advanced countries. At this point, I not only want to express my sincere respect to everyone present, but also to convey my ardent expectations to the entire press. For the sake of searching for ways to improve our country's economy and the people's livelihood, and for the sake of spreading the gospel of world peace and international cooperation, I wish you all good health and urge you to work hard. This time I, Yaozu, am going to Turkey as an envoy for the first time. I have no experience in diplomacy. Turkey has not yet established an embassy in our country, and our country's establishment of an embassy in Turkey is also a new venture. I am shallow in learning and dare not say that I can be competent for such an important mission. I can only do my best, with the interests of the country as the premise and the opinions of the people as the backing. I will consider matters carefully in order to live up to my mission. Since the government announced my appointment as envoy to Turkey, many public and private organizations and public discourse institutions have generously offered advice, either providing instructions on Sino-Turkish diplomacy, or inquiring about the causes and effects of Turkey's rejuvenation. This is a symbol of the general public's attention to national affairs. I feel an extraordinary sense of joy in my heart, and I feel I have much to say. However, before I reach my destination and conduct on-the-ground research, I dare not express too many opinions. Moreover, on today's occasion, I am limited by time and cannot express too many opinions. But I very much hope to provide relevant domestic agencies and organizations with actual research data on Turkey, or the results of my research, whenever possible, for reference. Regarding the facts of Turkey's rejuvenation and the comparison of national politics between China and Turkey, I gave a report at the Central Party Headquarters the other day. Although this report has been disclosed in a few newspapers, I am afraid that some of my compatriots are still unaware of it. Therefore, I would like to give a brief statement of the main points of the report the other day. First, let's talk about the comparison of nationalities: (1) Both nationalities are yellow. Furthermore, because nearly 100,000 Turks surrendered to our country during the fourth year of the Zhenguan reign of Emperor Taizong of Tang, and lived in China, it has been more than 1,300 years now. Turks can intermarry with Han and Hui people. Therefore, the bloodlines of the two races should be somewhat similar. (2) However, due to differences in location and climate, the Turkish people were still nomadic in the Middle Ages and early modern times. Our country has long been engaged in agriculture. Before the Zhou Dynasty, it had already become a farming nation. (3) The Turkish people's lives were still very simple hundreds of years ago, and their residences were not fixed. Therefore, there were frequent migrations. Our people's lives are complex and comfortable, so they have always been attached to their homeland. (4) In the past, the Turkish people had a very strong sense of self and did not easily accept foreign cultures and ideas. Our people have always been inclusive and have the power of assimilation. They are quite capable of embracing foreign cultures. (5) The Turkish people have never been completely conquered by other races. Therefore, they are stubborn and upright, with a spirit of adventure and enterprise. Unfortunately, the Han people were once conquered by the Yuan and Qing dynasties, which inevitably reduced the nation's self-esteem and self-confidence. As a result, our people lack a sense of national consciousness and political interest, and ambitious</p>

<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>countries have harbored thoughts of coveting and invading Russia. Now let's talk about the political comparison: (1) Both countries are large countries in Asia, but our country is larger, richer in resources, more populous, has a longer history, and a more complex social organization than Turkey (the area of ​​the territory is one to ten, and the number of people is about one to thirty). (2) The political systems of both countries were first monarchical autocracy and then democratic republic, but the time of our country's monarchical system and democratic system is longer (Turkey's democratic country was established in the twelfth year of the Republic of China). (3) Both countries have repeatedly expanded their territory and promoted their national prestige, but the strategies adopted are quite different. Turkey completely adopts the method of conquest (such as conquering various Balkan ethnic groups), which is close to hegemonic rule. Our country has always advocated the politics of benevolent rule, such as "If the San Miao do not submit, then dance with axes and shields, and the San Miao will come to submit themselves." The spirit of benevolent rule has enabled the Xianbei, Khitan, Jurchen, Miao, and Man ethnic groups to assimilate in history, and it is often used to integrate small ethnic groups nearby (for example, the policy of appeasement towards Korea, Vietnam, Burma, Siam, etc.). (4) In the past hundred years, both countries have experienced many internal conflicts, but the reasons and nature of the internal conflicts are different. In the 19th century, the foreign races ruled in the Turkish Empire were stimulated by the revolutionary ideology and often caused internal chaos and became independent. The alien races ruled in our country rarely rebelled and became independent. After the establishment of the Turkish democratic country, the nation was very united. Even the two revolutions before its establishment adopted peaceful means to avoid bloodshed. People of the same race in our country often engage in internal strife, and even after the establishment of the Republic of China, there have been several meaningless wars. This may be because the number of Han people is dozens of times more than that of the Turkish people, and our people are confined to the evolution of history and cannot change their mistakes and move towards good. (5) In the past hundred years, both have suffered from foreign aggression, have been bullied by great powers and exploited economically, and have lost many territories, lost part of their national sovereignty, and signed various unequal treaties (the most obvious are the consular jurisdiction and tariff restriction clauses). Now Turkey has restored its national sovereignty and achieved its goals. Our country should learn from the worthy, and give our whips a fierce crack, a few points that can be compared have been briefly described, and now I will put forward the factors that I personally believe are the key to Turkey's successful revival, and the characteristics that our country can learn from, and ask you for advice. (1) The most surprising thing about studying Turkey's revival is why Turkey was able to turn danger into safety in a year or so after the European War, when it was surrounded by enemies and at the end of its rope. In order to find this answer, we discovered the biggest difference between Turkey and our country, that is, when the Turkish people are in turmoil, they are sincerely, absolutely, and harmoniously united. They never have civil wars, and they always concentrate and unanimously face the outside world. This is the first factor in their success in the shortest possible time. (2) Although the Turkish people's lack of infighting is a successful factor, it is only a positive advantage. If we explore its positive factors, it is of course because there is a wise leader who awakens and organizes the people of the whole country, especially because the majority of the people can deeply understand the country's difficulties and uniformly obey disciplined leadership and work hard to move forward. Otherwise, whether it can break through the serious national crisis is still a big question. In other words, a wise leader, a good organization, strict discipline, an enterprising and united people are the second factor for Turkey's revival in the shortest possible time. (3) What is also worthy of special attention is the Turkish National Army. Everyone knows that Asia Minor is the place where the Turkish people live. It is for the survival of the Turkish people and the survival of the Turkish people. They do not care about any sacrifices. Therefore, the Greek army will not withdraw from Asia Minor for a day, and the National Army will continue to attack for a day. This kind of army organized for the purpose of protecting the survival of its country, this kind of spirit of identifying the enemy, vowing to fight to the death, and adhering to fearlessness is not only the central force for the revival of Turkey, but also the soul of the revival of the Turkish nation. This is the third factor in their success in the shortest possible time. (4) Finally, to make a further exploration, when Turkey was surrounded by enemies, the enemies of the National Army were very numerous. In addition to the Greeks, there were also British and French armies. Although the Turkish National Army was brave, it was outnumbered and the situation was very critical. In 1921, the French and Italian armies withdrew their troops, and the situation changed. Why did the two countries suddenly withdraw their troops? Was it because they were afraid of the fighting power of the Turkish National Army? Absolutely not. The reason why the governments of France and Italy ordered the withdrawal of troops was because the Turkish National Government had a real and tacit understanding with the two countries and concluded a mutually beneficial agreement. If the Turkish Nationalist Party cannot distinguish the priorities and take a broad view, it will not be able to identify the main enemy. If it does not have a complete diplomatic policy, it will not be willing to use lures to lure the enemy, nor will it be able to make the invaders disrupt their own lines. Therefore, sensitive diplomacy and diplomacy with foresight are the fourth factor for them to complete the revival in the shortest possible time. Not long ago, the great powers regarded Turkey as a sick man, and it was not enough to bully him and exploit him. They tried every means to seize his property. After the European War, Turkey was in a more dangerous position than our country today. But after several years of struggle and effort, the atmosphere has been renewed. He is competing with the great powers on the international political stage, and the great powers have to look at him differently. Our country is vast in territory, rich in resources, and has a large population. If the whole country can be uplifted and united, and the factors of Turkey's successful revival can be used as a lesson, and everything is implemented in a practical way, wouldn't it be possible to compete with the great powers at a rate of thousands of miles a day, not just keep pace with Turkey? Thank you very much for your presence tonight. In two days, I will be leaving the country. I would like to take this opportunity to say goodbye to everyone. Before parting, I would like to say one more thing: whether before or after I leave, no matter who has any advice, I will sincerely welcome it. Finally, please join me in a toast, wishing the Republic of China long live, and wishing the Chinese people peace and happiness.</p>
<h3>4,160,000 British Silver Dollars: Three Banks Withdrew from the Treasury Yesterday; China Bank Assigned Personnel to be Responsible for Loading and Unloading</h3>
<p>The silver dollars ordered by the Central, China, and Communications Banks from London, England, in addition to the first batch of 3,000,000 that had already been shipped to Shanghai, the second and third batches were also shipped to Shanghai on the "Radnorshire" of the British company the other day. They were unloaded and stored in the treasury by the three banks yesterday morning.

Later, due to the lack of silver on the British side, only 2,925,000 yuan was loaded on the "Radnorshire," and Hong Kong was telegraphed to add 1,235,000 yuan, totaling 4,160,000 yuan, which was loaded on the "Radnorshire" to Shanghai. The distribution method is 1,664,000 yuan for the Central Bank, 1,664,000 yuan for the Bank of China, and 832,000 yuan for the Communications Bank.

Therefore, the major Japanese commercial firms and manufacturing plants in Osaka have specially organized a Chinese inspection team, including hardware, machinery, metal products, stationery, electrical materials, automobiles, fountain pens, drawing materials, pump engines, mining, phonographs, waterproof equipment, groceries, oil paper, and other merchants, such as Shibazaki, Hirakichi, Chogen, Marutaka, Yoshinosuke Sakai, Ito, Funaoka, Nishimura, Kyokichi, Imai Suzuki, Yoshikin, Hasegawa, etc., a total of 26 manufacturers and dealers, in order to develop trade with China and promote Japanese goods, will conduct detailed inspections in southern China and the Yangtze River basin, in order to restore the situation before January 28th. They have already departed from Osaka and arrived in Shanghai on the Nagasaki Maru. They will only stay in Shanghai for one day and will take the Shanghai-Nanjing train to the capital yesterday. After inspecting in Nanjing, they will go to various places along the Yangtze River. This trip will last for one month and aims to inspect what kind of goods China needs, and then promote the sales of Japanese goods in China.</p>
<p>Yunyang Maru Resumes Navigation: The Nisshin Shipping Company's Yangtze River ships originally had 25 ships. After January 28th, only four ships were operating, and the rest were suspended. Last year, one ship was opened between Hankou and Yichang. Recently, another Yueyang Maru has been added to the Yangtze River in the past week. A total of six ships are operating. Recently, because Japanese goods are expected to be sold in China, the Tokyo headquarters of the Nisshin Shipping Company has decided to resume service one after another on the ships that have been suspended, taking a gradual approach. Therefore, the company has repaired the Yunyang Maru, which has been abandoned in Shanghai for more than three years, and began to send it to Yichang and Chongqing yesterday.</p>
<h3>Bureau of Social Affairs Promotes the Establishment of Worker-Farmer Cooperatives</h3>
<p>Since the Bureau of Social Affairs has actively promoted cooperative enterprises in this city, a vigorous atmosphere has emerged. The general public has also gradually understood the meaning of cooperatives, and there is no shortage of people who can organize them on their own initiative. Therefore, the number of cooperatives is also increasing day by day. The Bureau’s recent progress and plans for promoting cooperative enterprises are detailed below:</p>
<p>(1) Promoting Workers' Consumer Cooperative Enterprises</p>
<p>Motivation for Promotion</p>
<p>This city is a major industrial center in the country. According to recent statistics, there are more than 360,000 factory workers (and about 300,000 dock and transportation workers). These workers rely mainly on wages. However, because there is no organization of consumer cooperatives, the purchase of daily necessities is subject to layer upon layer of exploitation by middlemen, and workers' livelihoods are invisibly reduced. As a result, they are in a state of poverty and distress and cannot extricate themselves, even leading to major problems such as unemployment, which disrupt the order of social peace. Therefore, the promotion of workers' consumer cooperatives is an urgent matter that cannot be delayed. This is not only sufficient to solve the economic oppression suffered by ordinary workers, but also indirectly maintain social peace. The implementation plan is recorded below:</p>
<p>Zoning</p>
<p>The organization of workers' consumer cooperatives in this city is based on the zoning of workers in this city. The first district includes the Southern District; the second district includes the French Concession; the third district includes the Public Concession, west of North Sichuan Road and south of Suzhou Creek; the fourth district includes the Public Concession, east of North Sichuan Road; the fifth district includes the four districts of Yangjing Pond Bridge, Luxing, and Yangsi; the sixth district includes the two districts of Zhabei and Pengpu; the seventh district includes the three districts of Jiangwan, Yinxiang, and Yinhang; the eighth district includes the three districts of Wusong and Gaoqiao; the ninth district includes the two districts of Fahua and Caojing; the tenth district includes the Pusong District; and the eleventh district includes the Zhenru District. All factories that usually employ more than 300 workers should establish a worker consumer cooperative in each factory. Factories with fewer workers should jointly establish a cooperative with two or more factories nearby. However, small-scale factories that believe it is necessary to establish a consumer cooperative and are willing to voluntarily organize it may do so at their convenience. Consumer Cooperatives.</p>
<p>Phased Implementation</p>
<p>The area of this city is vast, and if it is held at the same time, there will be many difficulties in carrying out the work. It will be held in three phases, step by step, to achieve the effect of universalization. The first phase is the first district, the second phase is the second, third, fourth, fifth, and sixth districts, and the third phase is the seventh, eighth, ninth, tenth, and eleventh districts. The name of the consumer cooperative should be a certain factory (company or society). After the consumer cooperatives in the factories in the first phase have achieved results, the second and third phases of the districts listed above will be held. However, factories in each district that are willing to organize consumer cooperatives on their own initiative may do so at their convenience. After most of the factories in each district have established consumer cooperatives, they should immediately begin to organize the joint consumer cooperative of each district. When starting to organize the joint cooperative, the members of the trade union in each district should be responsible for preparing it, and they may borrow the trade union address as the office of the joint cooperative.</p>
<p>Publicity and Guidance</p>
<p>In terms of publicity, it is divided into (1) printing small booklets to explain the essence of consumer cooperation, organizational methods, and a summary of operations in popular language, and distributing them to trade unions and factories in various districts; (2) organizing cooperation lectures, with the Bureau hiring people with knowledge and experience in cooperation to give regular lectures on the principles of consumption, organization, and operational methods, etc., and ordering those in charge of the trade unions in each district to come to the Bureau to listen to the lectures, and then the trade unions in each district will be responsible for publicizing them to the factories. In addition, lecture meetings may tour various districts as needed by the environment; (3) trade unions and factories in each district, except for those that have labor schools or lecture meetings, etc., which are specifically for workers to receive supplementary education, should try their best to explain the principles and operations of cooperatives to workers, so that even illiterate workers can have a considerable understanding. Regarding guidance, if the operations of the consumer cooperatives or joint cooperatives of factories in various districts of this city are not very appropriate or there are errors in handling them when they are newly established, the Bureau should send personnel to assess and guide them at any time; (1) the Bureau should select personnel with rich cooperative knowledge and experience and assign them as instructors to assess and guide the consumer cooperatives or joint cooperatives of factories in various districts at any time; (2) if the consumer cooperatives or joint cooperatives in each district believe that detailed guidance is necessary, they may send personnel to reside in each district temporarily to provide roving guidance; (3) when the factory inspectors of the Bureau go to various factories to inspect, they should pay attention to and guide the consumer cooperatives that have been established at any time.</p>
<p>Carrying out Screening</p>
<p>(1) When the consumer cooperatives or joint cooperatives of factories in each district are first established, they should register with the Bureau in accordance with the procedures; (2) after screening the consumer cooperatives or joint cooperatives established by factories in each district, the Bureau will approve those that are considered to have achieved results for registration; (3) consumer cooperatives or joint cooperatives of factories in each district that are deemed to have achieved excellent results after screening may be given the following rewards by the Bureau: A, issuing a commendation order; B, awarding medals or certificates of merit; (4) consumer cooperatives or joint cooperatives of factories in each district that are deemed to be poorly managed after screening may be given the following punishments: A, issuing an order of censure; B, those who still fail to improve after being censured in writing more than twice may be ordered to reorganize. After the plan has been submitted by the Bureau to the Municipal Government for approval, six factory consumer cooperative instructors will be recruited to take charge of the investigation, publicity, and guidance work. The South Shanghai District has now been designated to conduct a pilot project, and instructors are sent to various factories on a daily basis to provide guidance and help them organize consumer cooperatives. At present, 13 cooperatives have been established in various factories in this city, and about 20 are in preparation (to be continued).</p>
<h3>More Convenient Transportation between Nanjing and Chongqing The China National Aviation Corporation Opens a Special Express Flight between Nanjing and Chongqing One Thousand Four Hundred Kilometers Can Be Reached in One Day</h3>
<p>Since the China National Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Sichuan line has completed the Chongqing-Chengdu section after the opening of the Chongqing-Chengdu section, the transportation between Shanghai and Sichuan has become extremely convenient. However, those who depart from Shanghai to Hankou every day must connect with the Hanyu Line the next day. It takes two days to reach it. The distance between Nanjing and Chongqing is 1,440 kilometers, and it is still inconvenient for passengers to fly mail. In view of this, the company has opened a special express flight between Nanjing and Chongqing. Although the flight is about 1,500 kilometers, it can be reached in one day. It is now scheduled to open on the 10th of this month. From then on, it will fly from Beijing to Chongqing every week and return from Chongqing to Beijing every Thursday. It will stop along the way, but the stations in Anqing and Shashi will not land for the time being. Moreover, for this special flight, it is heard that the company should consider the situation or be able to increase the number of flights. After the opening of this special flight, those who fly from Beijing to Kunming can also reach it in just two days. It is indeed a great convenience for air transportation between Beijing and Chongqing.</p>

<h3>The Shanghai Municipal Council Resolves to Ban Small Taxis Small Cars May Be in Danger after One Year of Operation</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Taxi Association petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council to run small cars, charging six cents for each delivery or twenty minutes. This proposal was carefully considered by the Transportation Committee and investigated in Singapore, Penang, Manila, and other places. According to the opinion of the Commissioner of Police, the existing taxis are sufficient for use, and the price is not expensive. The number of cars has not increased or decreased much in the past six years, and there is no need to limit it for the time being. It is difficult to say what the impact will be if small cars are allowed to run. However, he believes that the current taxis are most suitable for the current situation, and Shanghai cannot be compared with other ports. It is impossible to set up parking spaces for this type of vehicle, and small cars are damaged very quickly, so they must be inspected every month. Moreover, cars soliciting customers along the road have almost replaced rickshaws in Tokyo and Kobe, Japan, but this has increased a difficult problem for the police. After detailed discussion by the committee, it was considered that small cars could be tried, but with the following conditions: (1) No parking or soliciting customers on the street is allowed; (2) Passengers are limited to three people in addition to the driver; (3) The vehicle's manufacturing style must be approved by the Commissioner of Police and must pass the inspection on time. After this proposal was submitted to the board of directors meeting, the Commissioner of Police stated his opinion, saying that the structure of small cars is originally not durable and may be dangerous after one year of operation, and frequent inspections will also increase the expenses of the Shanghai Municipal Council. Moreover, the operating cost of small cars is no less than that of large cars, and it may not be beneficial to the car line. If the business of large cars is defeated, the small car style cannot be supported. Then, after discussion by the directors, the majority agreed with the Commissioner of Police's opinion and decided that, for the sake of transportation benefits, it would not be convenient to approve the application for small taxi operating licenses. It is found that the weight of the current taxis is about 2,250 pounds to 3,000 pounds, and the license fee for the concession is 33 yuan to 36 yuan per quarter. As for the so-called small car, the weight is about 1,000 to 1,500 pounds, and the license fee per quarter should be 27 yuan.</p>
<h3>Lin Shaofang Embezzles 50,000 Yuan from His Father The Police Report No Arrest and Issue an Arrest Warrant Shaofang Recently Returned to Shanghai and Was Detained Awaiting Trial</h3>
<p>Lin Yiquan, the owner of Lin's Garden at No. 110 North Sichuan Road, is a Cantonese with a solid family fortune. His second son, Lin Shaofang, graduated from Soochow University. In the autumn of the 18th year of the Republic of China, he was introduced to work at the Shanghai Hong Kong National Bank at No. 348 Jiangxi Road. From August to October, his father successively gave him 50,000 yuan to deposit in the bank to earn interest. However, he secretly used the above silver dollars as speculative gold trading capital and lost it all. He used a fake receipt to prevaricate his father. At the end of the year, Lin Yiquan went to the bank to check the deposit and found that it had all been embezzled by his son. Shaofang took the opportunity to escape to Fengtian at 6 pm on December 31. His father, together with the bank, reported to the police for arrest but to no avail. On January 4 of the following year, he issued an arrest warrant to the First Special District Court. On January 11 of the 20th year of the Republic of China, he hired lawyer Huang Yuping to publish an arrest warrant with a reward of 1,000 yuan, but no trace could be found. His father could only sigh in vain and had no way to do anything. Shaofang was short of money and drifted in a foreign land, which was not the end of the story. After thinking again and again, there was no better solution, so he returned to Shanghai to inquire about the news. He stayed in a certain hotel. At 4:45 pm the day before yesterday, he was passing by the vicinity of Bazilu North Jiangxi Road when he was caught by his fellow villager and relative Pan Jianqing. He refused to go home and quarreled with each other. Cantonese detective Feng Qi and Chinese police No. 986 found out and arrested him, took him to the Hongkou Police Station, and reported to the police chief, who ordered him to be detained. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Third Criminal Court. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, explained the process and said that the case involved the embezzlement of money, which was a relationship between father and son. The police asked for temporary detention. Lin Shaofang, dressed in a Western suit and leather shoes, was calm in his attitude and confessed that he was 34 years old. He admitted that he had embezzled the 50,000 yuan that his father had asked him to deposit in the bank. Judge Wu Zehan ordered him to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the trial.</p>
<h3>The Nanjing Road Citizens' Association Releases Telephone Usage Statistics Obtained from a Survey of Shops on Nanjing Road</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Company has increased its prices again this time, and the Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association have strongly opposed it. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the four major domestic product groups have jointly opposed it, and their expressions are stronger than before. Therefore, although the board of directors of the Shanghai Municipal Council still allowed the price increase, it failed to pass the "per-call calculation plan." However, users have received unofficial news from the company that the company is still determined to increase prices on a per-call basis and is currently using various methods to promote its success. The Nanjing Road Business Association and the First District Branch of the Citizens' Association have already found the 12.5% increase in telephone prices unbearable. Per-call calculation would be more than three or four times higher. They have surveyed the number of telephone calls used by their members and received reports from 93 companies with 150 telephone lines. Six lines make 270 calls per day, four lines make 130 calls, one line makes 103 calls, eight lines make 100 calls, two lines make 75 calls, one line makes 70 calls, four lines make 60 calls, one line makes 55 calls, six lines make 50 calls, three lines make 45 calls, ten lines make 40 calls, four lines make 33 calls, 26 lines make 30 calls, four lines make 25 calls, 28 lines make 110 calls, ten lines make 15 calls, eleven lines make 10 calls, and 21 lines make less than 10 calls. The above numbers are recorded separately every day from April 1 to 7 and averaged out, which is very accurate. According to this, most people make 20 to 30 calls per day. If the price is increased based on the number of calls, it will exceed the original price by more than one time, and even those who make less than 10 calls will increase by more than 12.5%. Not to mention those who make more than 30 calls per day. Therefore, the two associations have officially released the above survey statistics to arouse the attention of general users. In addition to expressing their opposition, they will send a letter to the Chinese Ratepayers' Association, asking the Chinese directors attending the Shanghai Municipal Council to pay close attention and not to blindly follow the Western directors' approval of the telephone company's unlimited profits due to the telephone company's deceptive petitions, so as to increase the burden on the citizens and hinder the development of transportation.</p>
<h3>A Prostitute Faints with a Wave of a Handkerchief A Ruffian Robs Jewelry</h3>
<p>At about 10 pm last night, the Le Li Hong prostitute house on Fuzhou Road and Yunnan Road suddenly received a phone call from Mr. Wang at Room 535 of the Yangtze Hotel, specifying that he wanted Hongfu Laoqi (name Wang Yuxian, 21 years old, from Suzhou) to come. At that time, Laoqi went in full dress. When she arrived at Room 535, she saw the name Ding written on the door. There were three young men in the room, two in Chinese clothes and one in a suit, all of whom she did not know. However, it was inconvenient to leave immediately, so she sat down and chatted with them. Unexpectedly, one of the young men suddenly waved a handkerchief towards Laoqi's nose, causing her to lose consciousness immediately. Fortunately, the tea servant on the floor saw that the three young men had suddenly left the room and had not seen the prostitute come out for a long time, so he became suspicious and went inside to check. He then discovered the situation and quickly helped the prostitute up and reported it to the police station, who sent a car to the hospital for treatment. After examination, it was found that she had been drugged. At the same time, a jade ring and a gold bracelet on the prostitute's hand had also disappeared. The police station briefly inquired about the appearance of the young men and started the investigation.</p>
<h3>A Dismissed Police Officer Acts as a Robber Opens Fire to Resist Arrest and is Finally Arrested</h3>
<p>Xu Hailin, a local, has been farming at No. 70 Houlu Xieqiao South Lane, Manufacturing Bureau Road, Nanshi. He has a wife and five children, two daughters who work in factories and three young sons. Xu usually lives a frugal life and has several houses and a vegetable field, which is enough to support his eight-member family. Unexpectedly, at about 9 pm the night before last, when Xu's wife was returning home after buying groceries, two robbers suddenly followed her and broke in. One of the robbers, wearing black glasses, pulled out a pistol and threatened her not to make a sound. Xu's eldest daughter, Daxin, happened to be returning from work when one of the robbers caught sight of a gold ring on Daxin's finger and snatched it away, kicking the girl down the stairs and injuring her head. The two robbers knew that they could not stay for long and fled together. At that time, Su Xianyao, the police chief of the Tangjiawan Police Station, was leading police officers Liang Guoying and Qian Yuehua on patrol and saw them looking flustered, knowing that they were not good people. They followed and chased them. The robber wearing glasses actually opened fire to resist arrest. The police also returned fire, and as a result, Police Chief Su was shot in the middle finger of his right hand, and the robber who resisted arrest was shot in the head and abdomen and was captured on the spot. An eight-inch pistol was seized, containing six bullets. Three years ago, he was a police officer at the Sanguantang Police Station, but he was dismissed by Police Chief Li for misconduct. The seized pistol seemed to be the gold ring that was snatched away last year when Police Officer Gu was砍伤 in one hand. It has been snatched away by another robber. The injured robber was sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment and will be investigated after he recovers.</p>
<h3>Xinzha Branch Bureau A Gambling Offender Dies Suddenly After Punishment The Death of Yan Fusheng is So Swift The Prosecutor Orders an Autopsy</h3>
<p>At 12:00 am the day before yesterday (Saturday), the Tanziawan Police Station of the Zhabei Xinzha Branch Bureau escorted gambling offenders Yan Fusheng (namely Yan Fusheng), Wang Ajin, Dai Abao, Liu Arer, Wang Xiaosanzi, Xiao Dengjie, Yang Yingen, Yang Fujun, and Wang Changfu, along with a pair of dominoes, gambling money of four cents of foreign currency, and 200 copper coins. After questioning by bureaucrat Ouyang Liu, Yan Fusheng admitted that he was the gambling leader and was sentenced to five days of detention. Wang Ajin and the other eight all admitted to gambling and were sentenced to three days of detention each. Unexpectedly, at 11:40 pm the next day (Sunday), the internal duty officer, police officer Kuai Dacai, reported that gambling offender Yan Fusheng in custody was currently suffering from shortness of breath and was sweating and feverish all over his body. He requested assistance. The director of the Ruan branch immediately ordered the police to send him to the Pushan Hospital for treatment. However, before they could leave the door, the gambling offender had already died. The director of the Ruan branch immediately reported to the Supervision Department of the Public Security Bureau. Yesterday morning, he ordered the head of the 11th district to file a petition with the Shanghai Local Court for an autopsy. In the afternoon, Prosecutor Zhao Chuanjia arrived at the scene to clarify the matter and summoned the deceased's wife, Qiao, who said that she was 36 years old, from Yancheng. At about 11 pm on the 6th, the Tanziawan Police Station came to arrest gamblers, a total of 13 people. Several people were bailed out, and the remaining nine people were immediately sent to the branch bureau. After arriving at the branch bureau, no one beat him or scolded him. However, the deceased had a history of asthma, etc. Then, according to the testimony of corpse Yan Lousheng, the deceased did not have any illness when he was arrested at the branch bureau. His sudden death is suspicious. After reviewing the testimony, the prosecutor ordered that the body be sent to the Zhenru Forensic Autopsy Institute for an autopsy. Yan Lousheng then requested that he be exempted from sending it, but it was not allowed. Therefore, the body was still left at the Xinzha Branch Bureau last night and must be sent to Zhenru for an autopsy today.</p>
<h3>Carrying Red Pills Arrested Manufacturing Organ Uncovered Raw Materials and Equipment Seized Related Persons Remanded for Further Questioning</h3>
<p>At 8:15 pm the night before last, Chen Linggen, a Yong native, was carrying 40 red pills and was walking through the intersection of North Fujian Road and North Suzhou Road when he was discovered by Chinese detective Li Wenbin of the Huisi Police Station. He was taken to the police station. Under questioning, Chen confessed that the red pills were purchased from Xiaoxizi in front of the clock shop at No. 32 Yunnan Road for self-consumption, costing four cents of foreign currency. Detective Li then went to the pavilion on the upper floor of the clock shop together with Detective Chief Tao Genrong and uncovered a red pill manufacturing organ. He arrested the suspects Zhang Youying, Wang Zixiang, Zhang Gengxin, Zhang Luoshi, and the second landlord woman Zhou Wangshi, etc., and confiscated 18 packages of poison pills, weighing more than five pounds, five sieves, one oven, one pill board, and one package each of coffee essence and white powder. He took them back to the police station and detained them separately. Yesterday morning, he was escorted to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police lawyer Qian Xunjiu filed a lawsuit against Chen in accordance with Article 13 of the Prohibition of Offenses, and against the other five people in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. He requested an investigation. Chen Linggen confessed that he had purchased it from Xiaoxizi, who was on the run, for his father to eat. Zhang Youying confessed that he rented the pavilion at No. 32 Yunnan Road from Zhou for a monthly rent of 12 yuan, which has been more than a year. However, the red pills only started working on the fourth day of the first month of this year. Wang Zixiang and Zhang Gengxin denied helping to manufacture them. Zhang Luoshi confessed that he was Zhang Weiying's wife. He came to Shanghai from Fujian for only ten days. Zhou Wangshi confessed that she rented out the remaining house, but she did not know that Zhang was making red pills. After reviewing the confession, Judge Wu Tingqi ordered Chen Linggen to be fined 40 yuan and the 40 red pills confiscated. Zhang Luoshi and Zhou Wangshi each obtained a 200 yuan store guarantee, and the rest were remanded in custody. The modification period will be January 10 for further questioning. The seized items will be temporarily stored in the warehouse.</p>
<h3>Two Kidnappers Executed Repent of Making Bad Friends and Being Fooled by Others</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhongyu, a Cantonese, lives at No. 10, Lane 423, and opened the Siyi Pingmu Two Weaving Silk Factory in Shanghai. His son, Yangge, is four years old. At about 1 pm on December 12 last year, kidnappers Shi Yushu (currently 41 years old) from Xinchang County, Shaoxing, and Shi Wenmao (currently 36 years old) from Sheng County broke in, using the excuse of sending gift red eggs, and kidnapped Zhang's child. They were taken to No. 9, Lane 578, Wuchang Road, and a large sum of money was demanded. They agreed to meet at Room 31, Far Eastern Hotel, Xizang Road, for negotiations. After the case was discovered, Chief Inspector Lu Liankui of the General Inspection Department, accompanied by Chinese and Western detectives, went to arrest the two criminals, Shi and Shi, and took them to the Laozha Police Station and escorted them to the First Special Court. After questioning, they were sentenced to death. They were submitted to the Jiangsu Provincial Government for approval and ordered to be executed. Yesterday morning, the police took the two criminals from the prison to the Third Criminal Court. Judge Shen Shanzeng presided over the execution. Li Zhishan, a lawyer from the Shanghai Municipal Council, presented the entire case file for inspection. The court asked the two criminals if they had any last words and sent letters to their families. According to Shi Yushu, he used to live at No. 665, Beile Road, French Concession, and worked as a car driver. He was actually fooled by the instigator, surnamed Xu, in this case. He is a swindler, and I am now regretting it too late. A relative, Ren Zhaoyu, works at the Dai Jianen Law Firm on the Trust Company Building on Beijing Road. He asked him to tell his wife to raise his children well and see the children as if she were seeing me. He also asked her to go to Caohejing to collect the body and ask relatives and friends to take care of her livelihood. He had no other words. He was calm and sad when he spoke. Shi Wenmao had a smile on his face and said that he had worked in the military for 17 years. After retiring, he returned to his hometown. He met a fellow villager, someone named Jia, in Zongzhou. He was deceived by him and blindly followed him to commit this illegal act. There are a wife and children in his family. Please write a letter to his relative Jiang Qingtang at the Dawang Temple in his hometown and forward it to his wife, asking him to take care of her. He had already sent a letter to his father-in-law and notified him, and he also sent a letter to Ms. Yin Jinfeng at No. 32 Weixingli, Du Shenfu Road, French Concession, asking her to collect the body at the execution ground and transport it back to his hometown. Shen Jun ordered Shi Yushu and Shi Wenmao to be sent to the Shanghai Local Procuratorate for execution. The Chinese and Western policemen immediately took the two criminals down, along with their files and portraits, and escorted them to the execution ground in Caohejing. They also notified the Nanshi Local Court and asked them to send personnel to carry out the execution. Chief Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin immediately appointed Prosecutor Xie Lian as the supervising officer and ordered Judicial Police Chief Chen Junfang and Deputy Police Chief Chen Xihui to supervise the execution police Shen Tingfang, Zhou Qiwen, Zhang Chunsen, Zou Zhendong, Cai Zuoqing, Song Changgui, Xu Guoguang, Zhao Mingyuan, Wang Tingbin, etc. to drive to the execution ground. The judges arrived at the prison in a short time, and the criminals' cars also arrived one after another. Prosecutor Xie then took office and ordered Shi Yushu and Shi Wenmao to be brought to the case and asked if they had any statements. The two criminals answered no in unison, but said that they had been careless in making friends and had been fooled by others. Today's outcome is regrettable. They asked everyone present to be very careful in making friends and said to the execution police, "Please keep your lives clean, and we will be grateful." The official ordered the execution to be carried out, and the two criminals immediately stepped into the execution ground and knelt down. Chen, the police chief, sounded a whistle, and two shots were fired at the same time. The two criminals fell to the ground at the same time, dying instantly. The coroner Xuan Zhiming inspected the bodies and took photos for record. The bodies were placed in coffins and left for their families to claim.</p>
<h3>A Student's Suicide by Poison: Taking Life Too Lightly, Death Not Worth It</h3>
<p>Dai A'jin, a 21-year-old from Jiangyin, had lost his parents in his youth. Through an introduction, he became an apprentice at a chrome factory at No. 432 Zhoujiazhui Road. He had been there for five years. He was usually diligent and thrifty at work. Unexpectedly, he recently suffered some unknown stimulation, which led him to think of ending his life. On the evening of the 5th of this month, he left the factory and never returned. He secretly swallowed sleeping pills to kill himself. When he reached the home of his cousin, Dai Sanming, at No. 542 Dalianwan Road, he was already in a daze and fell onto the bed. His cousin was shocked to see this and immediately sent him to Tongren Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died. The hospital reported to the Yulin Road police station, who ordered detective Jin Wanrong to investigate. Five sheets of sleeping pill prescriptions were found beside him. There were no last words or other items. The body was then taken to the autopsy station on Fielun Road. Yesterday morning, Inspector Guo Wei, commissioned by the First Special District Court, arrived at the station to examine the body. According to Dai Sanming's statement, "The deceased was my cousin. He came around 9 a.m. yesterday. I happened to be out. When I returned home at 11:30 a.m., I saw him lying on the bed. I called him, but he didn't respond. I thought he was sick and immediately asked a Chinese doctor nearby to diagnose him. The doctor told me to rush him to the hospital, but my son told me that the deceased had said he had a bone ache and went to bed, telling the child not to disturb him. I saw that he was unable to speak, so I didn't know what caused his death," and so on. After hearing the statement, Inspector Guo determined that the deceased, Dai A'jin, was a male who died of poisoning. The body was handed over to his cousin, Dai Sanming, who signed a pledge to take it back for funeral arrangements.</p>
<h3>Wet Nurse Feeds Infant Needles: Supreme Court Remands for Retrial</h3>
<p>Chen Tangshi, a 29-year-old woman from Yangzhou, lived at No. 5 Xuehuali Road in the French Concession, in the residence of Wu Ruicai, a current judge of the Civil Division of the Second District Court, who was from Minhou. On October 10, 1933, she was hired as a wet nurse for a monthly salary of eight yuan. After working for twelve days, she wanted to ask for leave to return to her hometown, but the master did not allow it because the child needed to be breastfed every day and could not be left alone. Unexpectedly, she harbored resentment and secretly beat and abused the child. On November 10, she slapped the child's face and was caught by the mistress, who immediately stopped her work and ordered her to return the two months' salary that had been advanced. Unexpectedly, Tangshi harbored even deeper resentment and dared to secretly break three sewing needles and feed them to the child. Soon, the child cried with severe abdominal pain. Doctors were consulted, but the cause of the illness could not be determined. By this time, Tangshi had been taken away by her guarantor. On the 11th, the broken needles in the child's abdomen were excreted. The Second District Court was notified, and the police department filed a public prosecution against her for attempted murder. At the conclusion of the trial, Tangshi was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment. She refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court. The result was that the appeal was rejected. All the details were reported in previous newspapers. However, she still refused to accept the decision and appealed to the Supreme Court in Nanjing. The Supreme Court reviewed the entire case file and found that there were still doubts in the case that had not been clarified. Therefore, it ruled to revoke the original judgment and remand the case to the Third Branch of the High Court for retrial. The High Court received the case file and will soon open a court session to summon witnesses and conduct the trial.</p>

<h3>Sanma Road: Reinstatement of Two-Way Rickshaw Traffic</h3>
<p>The 21st Branch of the Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Union stated that the Municipal Council had previously approved the reinstatement of two-way rickshaw traffic on Sanma Road and had issued a public notice. However, most rickshaw pullers found it difficult to follow the rules because the traffic time signs at the road junctions had not been updated. The branch recently sent a letter to the Municipal Council requesting that the traffic time signs on the road be updated and that the police on duty be notified. The following is the English translation of the Municipal Council's reply (No. 1): "Your letter has been received. Regarding the issue of one-way traffic not applying to rickshaws on Hankou Road, a public notice has already been issued. There is no need to worry about it again. The police officers serving on this road are all aware of this. Rickshaws can travel in any direction on this road without hindrance." (The rest omitted.) The branch has already notified all members to take note.</p>
<h3>Pudong: Public Buses to Start Operating Tomorrow; Public Utilities Bureau Adds Streetlights in Pudong District</h3>
<p>The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau is promoting municipal administration in the Pudong district, so it is organizing public bus services and expanding street lighting. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Public Buses: The Municipal Public Utilities Bureau believes that the Pudong area is vast, with a shortage of vehicles and inconvenient transportation. Therefore, it is organizing public bus services in the Pudong district, planning routes, and setting prices. However, the contractor has not yet delivered the vehicles. In order to facilitate public transportation, the Public Utilities Bureau has decided to transfer three old-style public buses from the southern district to be used on the section from Dongchang Road to Qinci Yangdian. The service is scheduled to begin on the 10th, with a full-route fare of twenty-four cents. Once the new vehicles are delivered, all routes will be opened.</p>
<p>Adding Streetlights: At the same time, the Public Utilities Bureau believes that the streetlights in the Pudong area are too far apart and not perfect. Therefore, it has decided to add streetlights on Pudong Avenue (from Zhoujiadu to Zhangjiabang and from Wujiatang to the west section of Donggou), Yangjingzhen Si San Lane (from the front of the fire station westward to the Yuanshengtai Lumber Company), and other places. However, because there are no power poles yet, the bureau has ordered the Pudong Electric Power Company to begin installing them to facilitate the installation.</p>

<h3>Public Security Bureau Water Patrol Team Cracks Down on Dumping Manure Along the Bund</h3>

<h3>Books and Newspapers Cooperative: Tan Tian Wins Appeal, Fined 100 Yuan</h3>
<p>The Kaiming Bookstore and the Books and Newspapers Cooperative competed and publicly accused each other in newspapers due to the printing and distribution of the posthumous works of the late Hanlin scholar Ke Shaomin's New Yuan History. Zhang Xichen, the manager of Kaiming, stated that Tan Tian, the manager of the Books and Newspapers Cooperative, used the terms "general merchants" and "omissions and errors" in an advertisement published on January 28, which was actually scolding Kaiming. Zhang then filed a criminal lawsuit against Tan Tian for copyright infringement and public defamation through his lawyer, Sun Zuji. The First Special District Court initially ruled that the copyright infringement part was rejected, and the defamation part was determined that "merchant" was indeed a scolding term and was unwilling to accept the decision. His defense lawyer, Li Mo, submitted an appeal, citing various commentaries and books on the interpretation of the word "merchant," stating that it had no meaning of defamation and was not specifically referring to Kaiming with the term "merchant." Therefore, it was difficult to accept the original judgment. On the afternoon of last Monday, Qian Hongye, the presiding judge of the First Special Court's Criminal Division, together with two judges, Wu Tingqi and Wu Zehan, specially opened a collegial panel to summon both parties, investigate evidence, and conduct the statutory procedures of statements and debates. The verdict was announced in court yesterday afternoon. The main text was "The original judgment is revoked, Tan Tian publicly insulted others and is fined 100 yuan, and the remaining part of the defamation lawsuit is acquitted."</p>
<h3>Cai Songchun and Others Acquitted</h3>
<p>The woman Chen Jiangshi, previously because after becoming pregnant, she had bleeding from time to time, still went to Cai Songchun and Cai Baichun, national physicians specializing in women's medicine, at No. 5 Gu Shan Lane, Xihuaide Road, Hongkou, for diagnosis and treatment. Later, Chen had a miscarriage, believing that it was caused by the herbs prescribed by Cai, including Ze Xie and Tong Cao. She then brought the lawsuit to the First Special District Court, requesting that they be punished for the crime of negligent injury. The Special District Court repeatedly summoned the Cai’s, who claimed that Chen's miscarriage was caused by lifting heavy objects. The court sent the prescription to the Shanghai National Medicine Association for determination. The result was that Cai's prescription was not mistaken, and Cai also presented various gynecology medical books to prove the appropriateness of using Ban Xia and Tong Cao, and hired lawyers to defend them. After the interrogation was over, the details have been detailed in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Xiang Yinghua opened the ninth criminal court and announced the verdict, the main text being that Cai Songchun and Cai Baichun were acquitted.</p>

<h3>Yuanxing Steamer Aground at Shierxu, Hull Deeply Stuck in Shoal, Already Unloading Cargo</h3>
<p>The Yuanxing Company's Yuanxing steamer, managed by Dakang, is a "wild flag" vessel, loading cargo everywhere. This time, it was fully loaded with coal from Pukou, Nanjing, bound for Shanghai. It left Pukou on the evening of the 7th. That night, it reached the waters of Shierxu near Zhenjiang. Due to poor weather conditions and fog on the river, it mistakenly sailed into a shoal and the hull ran aground.</p>
<p>Unable to Escape</p>
<p>After the accident, the shipowner tried to get out of the shoal by running the engines at full power and reversing, but the ship was fully loaded with coal and the hull was very heavy. The hull was deeply stuck in the sand, and all kinds of methods failed to move it even a bit. He had no choice but to urgently telegraph Shanghai for help yesterday morning (the 8th).</p>
<p>Unloading Cargo</p>
<p>Upon receiving the news, the Yuanxing Company immediately discussed and decided to unload the cargo from the ship in order to reduce the load and make the rescue easier. It immediately telegraphed the Zhenjiang agency to hire tugs and barges to unload the cargo from the hold first, so that the hull could float, and then tow it away at high tide.</p>
<p>Reporting to All Parties</p>
<p>The Yuanxing steamer has a load capacity of over 1,000 tons and has peace insurance with the Shanghai Ship Insurance Association. Yesterday, it sent a letter to the insurance company, stating that the company's Yuanxing steamer ran aground in the waters of Shierxu last night (the 7th) while loading cargo from Pukou, Nanjing, bound for Shanghai. A telegram has been sent to Shanghai this morning (the 8th). The company immediately telegraphed Zhenjiang, ordering the agency to quickly unload the cargo and then seek towing assistance. The shipowner's original telegram was attached. (The rest omitted.)</p>
<h3>Shanghai Law and Politics Lawyers Association Welcomes President Zhang Shizhao</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Law and Politics Lawyers Association, at 3:00 p.m. on the day before yesterday (the 7th), held a gathering at the Yiyou Society Hall at No. 115 Hankou Road to welcome the newly appointed President Zhang Shizhao of the Shanghai Law and Politics College, as well as Dean Xia Anxiu and Secretary-General Shu Zhirui. Eighty-some members attended, including Zhang Shanle, Zhang Shijie, Xi Mengqi, Chen Yunyun, Gu Kenfu, Li Ming, Dong Chi, Yang Zhihao, Zhang Shiying, Yin Shijie, Wang Weizhen, Ji Zongsui, Zhu Lanjia, Zhang Lan, Feng Xizui, Ge Cheng, Gong Ying, Luo Liang, Yang Qingyuan, Wu Zhengqiao, Zhang Runmin, and Sun Fucheng. Yang Zhihao first introduced each member in order, followed by Chairman Zhang Shijie delivering a welcome speech. Then, President Zhang gave a speech, saying that he was very grateful for the invitation from everyone today and that he dared not accept the word "welcome." In this era of academic competition, regardless of age or position, he hoped that everyone would work hard on their studies and exchange knowledge. Shizhao only learned after taking over the position that there was such a great organization among the alumni who had graduated. He was deeply gratified. He had no special research on education, but based on his past work experience, he focused on personal responsibility. After taking over as the president of the Law College, he would do his best. Mr. Xia and Mr. Shu assisted in the college affairs, working hard and being willing to bear hardships. Their spirit of doing things was the same as Shizhao. Although the future of the college was unpredictable, fortunately, as Mr. Zhang Shijie said, the selection of the president has changed several times over the years, but the spirit of running the school has always been consistent. This is something that can be comforted. Today's meeting made me feel that the indelible spirit of the Law College for more than ten years exists transcendently and has its own historical value. It is hoped that this spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation will be expanded, so that the Law College will be bright and promising. I know that I have no other strengths, but I can be confident that I am open-minded in everything. You know more about the content and past history of the Law College. If you have any opinions on what should be reformed, please put them forward as much as possible so that they can be adopted at any time. Then, Secretary-General Shu Zhirui reported on the recent improvements of the Law and Politics College in detail, saying that an agreement had been reached with the University of Paris in France and the University of Belgium that all graduates of the college would be exempt from the entrance examination when studying at the universities. This shows that the college has a considerable position internationally. In the future, it is hoped that a portion of the French indemnity will be allocated, and the Belgian indemnity is also in progress. This is indeed good news for building school buildings. Subsequently, Yang Zhihao, Wu Zhengqiao, Wang Weizhen, and Zhang Runmin expressed their opinions. Finally, Chairman Zhang Shijie expressed his thanks and reported on the organizational content of the association. Tea and refreshments were then served, and the meeting ended at 6:30 p.m.</p>
<h3>Chamber of Commerce Submits to Ministry of Finance, Requesting Exemption from New Jade Export Tax</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce submitted a request to the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that on the 5th of this month, the Municipal Antique Industry Association stated in a letter that the association had received a letter from new jade members, stating that since the Shanghai War, all domestic industries have been in decline and international trade has been sluggish. The important reason is the economic panic and the dynamics of the times. As a result, foreign trade has plummeted, and the number of imports has increased day by day, which cannot be curbed. Exports have decreased sharply. The new jade industry is even worse. New jade relies entirely on sales to Europe and the United States and is classified as a cultural plaything. The number is very small and was not worth paying attention to. In recent years, it has become even more depressed. The reason is the high cost. The raw materials for these items are minerals, and all rely on handmade polishing to imitate ancient manufacturing equipment, resulting in slow production and a sharp increase in the number of living indexes, which make the tax rate heavier. Although they try to lower the value, sales are still small. Merchants in this industry are barely surviving. If there is no speedy relief to restore the original foreign trade situation, then society will inevitably increase the number of unemployed people by the thousands, and the country will also lose one type of export trade and production. If the country and society suffer major losses, they are now trying to seek self-relief to reduce the accumulated costs, and ask them to submit a document to the Ministry of Finance to verify and exempt the export tax rate in order to maintain livelihoods. The association believes that what the new jade members are requesting is indeed the truth. Therefore, it is submitting a detailed account of the commercial difficulties, and requesting the Ministry of Finance to follow the precedent of verifying and exempting the export tax on domestic products such as ivory, carpets, porcelain, and cloisonné, and to approve the request to verify and exempt the export tax rate on new jade in order to maintain industrial and commercial foreign trade, so as to passively reduce imports and actively prevent unemployment. Industry and commerce are fortunate, and the country is fortunate, and await orders. After receiving the letter, the association found that it had issued several opinions on cutting and writing off transit taxes and reducing and exempting export taxes in order to alleviate the massive imports and reverse the industrial and commercial recession. The new jade item is sold to Europe and the United States because it is classified as a cultural toy. The sales volume is not high, but because the makers all rely on hand polishing, which takes a long time, there are still many workers who rely on it for their livelihoods. In recent years, under the influence of the world's economic recession, this industry has also been in decline. It is even more necessary to exempt taxes and reduce costs in order to save it. The types of goods that the industry requested to be exempted from export tax this time are all kinds of jade, all kinds of crystal stones, all kinds of agate, all kinds of powder jade, coral fluorite and other ornaments, and various unfinished jade stones. According to the current export tax, all are taxed at a rate of 7.05 per hundred from the price, the burden is heavy, and sales are not good. According to the letter, it is practical and convenient to handle.</p>
<h3>Ningbo Native Association Discusses Disaster Relief Rice for Various Counties in Old Ning Prefecture Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai, due to the severe disaster situation in various counties in Ning Prefecture, decided to purchase 50,000 shi of Saigon rice for disaster relief and submitted a request to the government to issue a tax-free passport. The passport has now been received. A joint meeting of executive and supervisory committee members was specially convened yesterday to discuss disaster relief procedures.

Chairman Yu Qiaqing first had Zhang Shenzhi, the chairman of the association, report on the handling of the application for a tax-free passport and the proposed procedures for distributing disaster relief rice. After discussion, it was resolved that: (1) Although the tax-free passport requested by the association has been received, it will still take time to purchase foreign rice, and the disaster victims are waiting for food. In order to take care of the facts, the association will first borrow rice from the Ningbo rice industry. (2) Leveling rice prices and providing relief will be carried out simultaneously. (3) Qin Runqing, Huang Yanfang, Zhu Meixian, Fang Jiaobo, Hong Yanbin, Mao Heyuan, and Yuan Ludeng were appointed as seven committee members to be responsible for handling the matter. Following that, the proposal of member Yu Xinyan and others to establish the Siming Sports Ground and the Siming Funeral Home was discussed. It was resolved to send a letter to the Siming Public Office to investigate and handle the matter.</p>
<h3>Traveling in Sheng: Zhou Lingfa from Ningbo Falsely Accused and Detained; Fellow Townsmen Associations in Ningbo and Dinghai Seek Redress</h3>
<p>Zhou Lingfa, a native of Dinghai residing in Shengshan, Chongming County, is 52 years old. He engages in the fishing industry and runs a Tongxiang grocery store. He enjoys a good reputation in the Shengshan business community and enthusiastically supports local public welfare. As a result, he has been envied by some petty people who falsely accused him to the Jiangsu Provincial Government of being involved in a drug trafficking operation in Dagangshan Dahang, Shengshan. After investigation by officials sent by the provincial government, no suspicion was found, confirming that he was framed. Yang Youcai, Gu Youfa, and many Shengshan merchants, who were also implicated in the false accusation, provided signed affidavits to the provincial government. On the 24th of last month, Deng Hui, a special agent of the Songhu Garrison Headquarters in Shanghai, reinvestigated the case and detained Zhou Lingfa. Merchants in Shengshan, believing Zhou Lingfa to be a legitimate businessman, sent a telegram to the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, requesting assistance in seeking redress. The association, upon learning the situation and noting Zhou Lingfa's origin from Dinghai, decided to jointly petition the Songhu Garrison Headquarters with the Dinghai Association in Shanghai, requesting a swift and clear investigation and release of the innocent, to alleviate the injustice.</p>
<h3>Jiangxi Guangda Porcelain Factory Begins Collection of Share Payments; Shanghai Share Payments to be Collected and Submitted by Kong Xiangxi and Others</h3>
<p>Since the Jiangxi Guangda Porcelain Factory received an allocation of 200,000 yuan from the Jiangxi Provincial Government as seed capital and to guarantee dividend payments for three years, fundraising from all sectors of the country by founder Du Chongyuan has progressed very smoothly. It is reported that in the Tianjin area, over 200,000 yuan of shares have been subscribed, with more than half of the share payments already received. The submission of share payments from other provinces such as Hunan, Hubei, Shandong, and Shaanxi is also progressing well. In Shanghai's business community, associations such as the China National Products Sales Association, and the employees and factories of various associations have almost entirely subscribed to shares. A total of 400,000 yuan has been raised in Shanghai, but not all payments have been cleared. When Mr. Du Chongyuan returned to Jiangxi last month, he carried a letter signed by Kong Xiangxi, Li Shizeng, Du Yuesheng, Zhang Gongquan, Zhang Xiaolin, Xu Xinliu, Qian Xinzhi, Wu Yunzhai, and others, addressed to Jiangxi Chairman Xiong Shihui, stating that the 400,000 yuan in share payments from Shanghai would be the responsibility of Kong, Li, Du, Zhang, and others, and would be collected and submitted in full in the near future. It is reported that the founder of the factory, Du Chongyuan, is currently in Jiujiang supervising the construction of the factory buildings, procuring machinery, and training workers. The collection of share payments from all over the country is also starting. It is hoped that one million yuan in share payments can be collected by the end of June this year.</p>

The hurricane northeast of Macclesfield Bank is still moving northwest. The center of the hurricane was approximately within 120 miles of 16 degrees north latitude and 119 degrees east longitude at 6:00 AM. The wind force is unknown. Also, in the 24 hours before 3:00 PM yesterday, the highest temperature in Shanghai was 58.1 degrees and the lowest was 52.3 degrees. On the same day last year, the highest was 76.1 degrees and the lowest was 49.6 degrees.</p>

<h3>Jin Cheng Bank's Business Report for 1934</h3>
<p>— (26)</p>
<p>Category Number Type Loan Amount</p>
<p>Agriculture 830 12 types 12,359 yuan</p>
<p>Industry 850 124 industries 18,291 yuan</p>
<p>Commerce 2,145 118 industries 31,107 yuan</p>
<p>(Note) The above loan amounts range from 1 yuan to 200 yuan.</p>
<p>The average loan per household is 16 yuan.</p>
<p>In addition, the bank's total loan amount in that area is limited to 200 yuan, which is not enough to meet the needs of society. Therefore, a special small loan category was established, with amounts ranging from 200 yuan to 1,000 yuan. This year, the total amount of loans issued was 120,920 yuan, with a total of 193 borrowers. 53,325 yuan has been successively recovered. As of the end of the year, the actual outstanding balance was 67,595 yuan, with 161 actual borrowers.</p>
<p>Most of the above small loans and small-amount loans can be repaid as agreed when due, which shows that the people of our country respect credit and that the loans can be used for production and to assist where necessary.</p>
<p>B. Assisting the Rural Economy</p>
<p>The revitalization of the rural economy is an urgent task today. The whole country is discussing ways to promote it. Considering the vast territory of our country, the many improvements that should be made in agriculture, and the complexity of its related situation, the bank is a commercial bank. How dare it say that it has made a contribution? However, since this matter concerns the foundation of the country, it can only do what it can, and work with various social organizations to make considerable efforts in research and partial implementation to assist in every possible way. The details of this year's work are listed below: (1) The organization of the North China Agricultural Research and Improvement Association. The association is jointly organized by the bank, Tianjin Nankai University, and the Ding County Mass Education Promotion Association. It is divided into research and implementation departments, working together to improve cotton production, which occupies an important position in Hebei's agricultural products and has a special relationship in our country's economy. Therefore, it will start with this. The research work is to improve quality, establish breeding grounds, and investigate the production and sales situation in various places to facilitate improvement. The implementation work is to regulate finance and promote transportation and sales, such as providing production loans, establishing warehouses, and handling mortgages in Ding, Zhao, Li Jin, Nangong, Wuji, Shulu and other places, guiding the organization of cooperatives, etc. As a result, the cotton production of various cooperatives is still able to be sold at higher prices than usual, increasing the direct income of cotton farmers. It is estimated that each bale earns an additional profit of 2 to 4 yuan. Although the amount is small, by analogy, if the scope is gradually expanded, it seems that it will be beneficial to the rural economy.</p>
<p>(2) The organization of joint loans for cotton production and marketing cooperatives in Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi. In June of the third year, the bank joined with five other banks in the same industry to regulate the cotton production finance of the three provinces of Shaanxi, Henan, and Shanxi. The Shaanxi Cotton Production Improvement Institute was entrusted to organize cotton production and marketing cooperatives in the three provinces and act as an agent for the banks to issue funds. The cooperatives were managed separately for production loans, transportation loans, and sales loans.</p>
<p>In addition, the bank or its affiliates invest in or operate packing plants and cotton ginning plants related to the production and marketing of agricultural products, such as those in Zhengzhou, Xi'an, Lingbao, Zhangde, and Nantong. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>On "Scholars Despising Each Other" (1)</h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>"Our family's" Zihuan, 1,800 years ago, said the phrase "Scholars despise each other, it has been so since ancient times," which has been used by some people as a defense and explanation for "personal attacks." Sometimes, when so-called scholars are seen "scolding each other," it is said to be "scholars despising each other," and all serious criticism is lumped together with "despising," thinking that criticism is the same as scolding. It seems that "our family's" Zihuan did not say it that way.</p>
<p>In his essay "Dian Lun Lun Wen," after the sentence "Scholars despise each other, it has been so since ancient times," he immediately mentioned Ban Gu's criticism of Fu Yi, saying, "Wu Zhong (Fu Yi's courtesy name) was able to write, and was the order of the Lantai, but could not stop his pen. Ban Gu said that Fu Yi "could not stop his pen," which was a technical criticism. So Zihuan explained the reason for "despising each other," saying: "People are abundant in self-view, and writing is not of one form, and few can be fully virtuous. Therefore, each despises what they are short in with what they are long in." Later, he talked about the Seven Masters of Jian'an, and said: "These seven masters, there is nothing left in learning, and nothing borrowed in words. All ride their steeds for thousands of miles, and look up to stride side by side. It is very difficult to subdue each other with this!" Strictly speaking, "scholars despising each other" is only a kind of "criticism" and does not contain the meaning of "scolding each other."</p>
<p>I am now presumptuously acting as a confidant and elaborating on the meaning of what "our family's" Zihuan called "scholars despising each other."</p>
<p>Liu Xie said, "People's talents are different in speed... Those who are quick to develop their talents have a good grasp of the key techniques, are quick to think ahead, and make decisive decisions; those who think deeply have many paths in their emotions, are aware after doubts, and are determined after research. Because of their quick thinking, they succeed hastily, and because of their doubt, they achieve results over time." (Wen Xin Diao Long: Shen Si). For example, Sima Xiangru wrote Shanglin Zixu, focusing his attention and effort, and it took almost a hundred days to succeed. The eldest son of Huang Zu hosted a shooting competition for guests, and someone offered a parrot: She asked Mi Heng to write a poem, and Mi Heng wrote it with a pen, "The writing was flawless and the words were beautiful." Between these two poets, the difference in speed was so great, who is higher and who is lower? Han Wu Story recorded: "The emperor (Emperor Wu of Han) liked lyrics and poems. Whenever he traveled and saw strange beasts and objects, he would order Xiangru to write poems about them. The emperor himself also wrote hundreds of poems, which he completed with a pen and did not think about them beforehand. Xiangru took a long time to create writing, and the emperor was always pleased with his craftsmanship. He said to Xiangru, "Can I exchange my speed for your slowness?" Xiangru said, "It is possible for me, but I do not know how your majesty would feel?" The emperor laughed loudly and did not blame him." Between these monarchs and ministers, one slow and one fast, each was a little self-satisfied and did not give in to each other. Western Capital Miscellaneous Records said: "Mei Gao's articles were quick and agile, and Zhang Qing's production was slow and delayed. Both exhausted the praise of the time. However, Zhang Qing's beginning and end were gentle and beautiful, and Mei Gao's sometimes had clumsy sentences. Therefore, we know that quick travel has no good traces." The words showed quite a bit of respect for Xiangru. And the author of Records of the Three Kingdoms, Chen Shou, praised Wang Can: "He composed with a pen and did not make any changes. People at the time often thought that it was a pre-existing structure. However, even if it was deeply thought out, it could not be added." He praised Cao Zhi for composing Copper Sparrow Terrace Fu "lifting his pen and completing it, and it was worth seeing." Also deeply admired. There are clearly these two different methods between writers, so it is easy to "despise what they are short in with what they are long in."</p>
<p>The emphasis on form and content among writers has been a very divided debate in almost every era. Pei Ziye, a great historian of the Qi and Liang dynasties, wrote An Essay on Carving Insects, opposing the literary trend of taking decoration as ability, saying: "Young boys and girls, nobles and children, all do not abandon the six arts, chanting sentiments. Scholars take broad dependence as an urgent task, saying that chapters and sentences are narrow and stupid, and indulging in literature and breaking the classics is a success, which is not covered by musical instruments, and is not only about etiquette and righteousness... Their excitement is superficial, their ambition is weak, skillful but not important, hidden but not deep... Xun Qing said, 'A sign of a chaotic era is that writing is hidden and out of touch.' Is this not close to it?" Emperor Jianwen of Liang was not happy when he saw it, and replied to King Xiangdong: "Now there are those who imitate Xie Kangle, and Pei Honglu (Ziye)'s writings are also quite confusing. Why? Xie Ke's words are naturally pulled out of the sky, and there are times when he is not constrained, which is his dross. Pei is a talented historian, with no beauty in his writing. To learn Xie is not to reach its essence, but only to get its length; to learn Pei is to abandon its strengths, and only get its weaknesses. Xie is so clever that he cannot be climbed, and Pei is so qualitative that he should not be admired... Therefore, jade emblems and gold chisels are ridiculed by clumsy eyes, and the Lower Lane of Ba people is more suitable for the listening of Yingzhong. The spring is high and not harmonious, and the wonderful sound is cut off and not sought. After all, without careful discussion, weighing the quality of writing, there is a different skill, and finally ashamed of the beautiful hand. Therefore, scholars who hold jade retreat when they see Zheng, and people who wear Zhangfu and jade shoes sigh when they look at Minxiang. Poetry is like this, and writing is also like this, only because the ink is silent, it is driven and dyed, and the paper is ruthless, it is allowed to shake and fold. How great, the horizontal flow of writing, has reached this point!" Such a sharp and contrasting one knife, one gun, is quite beautiful. In addition, between the two, there is a third hero who came out, Yan Zhitui in the article chapter said: "Today's world inherits and abandons the end, and they all float with dust. Words compete with reason, and words win and reason is suppressed. Things compete with talent, and things are complex and talent is damaged. The dissolute flow away and forget to return, and the chisellers patch and are insufficient. The times are like this, how can we alone violate it, but we must go to the extreme. There must be a great talent and reputation to reform the style, which is what I hope for." Li Yanshou's preface to Northern History Literary Garden Biography said: "And in the Yongming Tianjian period, between the Taihe Tianbao, Luoyang Jiangzuo, literature and elegance were especially prosperous. The preferences of each other are quite different. Jiangzuo palace music is developed and more valuable than Qingqi; Hebei's words and meanings are chaste and strong, and more important than temperament. Temperament then reason wins over words, Qingqi then literature exceeds its meaning. Those who win with reason are convenient for the times, and those who are literary are suitable for singing songs. This is the general difference between the gains and losses of northern and southern lyricists. If they can receive his Qing sound, simplify his tired sentences, each remove their short, combine their strengths, then literature and quality will be refined, and all beauty will be perfect." This argument of equal emphasis on form and content can also be said to be a kind of scholar's mutual contempt.</p>
<h3>Loving Through Hating</h3>
<p>— Long Gonggong</p>
<p>Once, in an essay by a writer, there was a main argument that said: "...All the great writers in the world, past and present, are humanists. They hate the ignorant masses, the more they hate them, the more they love them, and when they hate them to the point of no return, they give their lives to save them..." The most interesting slogan was: "They hate to love, and love to hate!" The original text has been remembered vaguely, and the above quote is only an approximation, but that slogan will never be forgotten.</p>
<p>If a talented man loves a beautiful woman, and the beautiful woman ignores him, then the talented man hates her to the bone. This is purely "hating to love" and is easy to understand.</p>
<p>But I don't understand how to "love through hating" – how unimaginable that is! Later, after reading Gorky's "Reminiscences of Tolstoy," I found a barely similar character in the article "The Shepherd."</p>
<p>The shepherd Dingtai Botzuofu is "a man with a complete soul. He is smart, upright, lives a life of moderation, and is very cheerful. He is over sixty years old, but his body is still fat and strong, with a broad chest and a bronze complexion." He is a philosopher. He scolds education.</p>
<p>"Why do humans have to live separately? Because of education. Education separates me and you, preventing us from understanding each other... Everyone calls the children to a place to gather, and for several years, they teach them some troubles... How can education be given to everyone? There will not be so much education in the world!... Knowing the law: Don't take things that don't belong to you, be careful of your own property, don't eat all the food, you should leave some for the dog, wear warm clothes, believe in God - you see, this is what a good person knows. This is the education that good people need most..." People who have been educated are all crazy people, people with confused minds."</p>
<p>He often said such things. He determined that the thing that caused problems among human beings was education; ridiculed the landlord's son Mi Jia for wearing glasses and catching butterflies, collecting golden beetles and grass leaves all day long, preparing to write a book about the life of insects (this educated man also said that mosquitoes spread fever, advising him to be careful); because a teacher used his position as a teacher to tell the children that the emperor was the cause of all suffering, he scolded the teacher: "If he is not a beast, he must be a fool. He is a cow."</p>
<p>But later Gorky learned that "this shepherd has two fatherless and motherless nephews, who are both studying, and the shepherd is paying for it, one at the Veterinary School in Kazan, and one at the Middle School in Ulady," so when he went to question him, he said in a low voice:</p>
<p>"My nephews are related to me by blood. You are just an outsider, like a traveling beggar, as the world says. So I act for my own benefit in the way that all mentally sound people do. I want my people to be educated, but I don't want others to be educated... Do you understand? This is... Everyone says: Whether you want to or not, relatives are still relatives. So I use myself to help my own relatives. Do you believe that I don't want to see them become decent gentlemen?... "</p>
<p>This Mr. Dingtai Botzuofu can probably be said to hate education to the extreme, and then he loved it, wanting to monopolize education, which is a bit like "loving through hating."</p>
<h3>Youth</h3>
<p>— Li Sanlang</p>
<p>Is my youth forever buried with the passing time in silence?</p>
<p>However, this dark journey has long ruined the pure heart that had not yet left my childhood.</p>
<p>During the day, I seek my meager nourishment alone with a hurried tune; in the evening, the streets are so cold and I return with a tired body, quietly meditating and writing in that same small house filled with the depressing smell of misfortune, spending the desolate night so regularly from seven o'clock to two o'clock after midnight. This time is most suitable for working, and I rarely let it be blown away with the howling wind outside the window. When the young dancer living in the front building returns with heavy steps, it is two o'clock after midnight. The faint and distant urban rooster is crowing, as if urging me not to spend the cold night like this and ruin my youth.</p>
<p>—It is time to go to sleep.</p>
<p>However, I lie in bed, my heavy head so habitually stirring up scenes of thought - in the childhood of seven or eight years old, living in the quiet countryside, hearing such a crowing sound, the sky was still dim, and the people in the countryside quickly got up and waited for the beautiful sun to rise in the east. Later, I moved to the city and rarely heard the crowing of roosters. Now, I am living such an abnormal life—I only go to sleep when the crane crows.</p>
<p>Tired body, in the small cloth bed, in the sturdy quilt that has wandered with me for so long. Thinking of all kinds of darkness and indignation in the world, thinking of how I should resolutely pursue the path of great light, thinking of how I should use my pen to depict the people who are living a painful life in the circle of darkness. At that time, my head was stimulated and very excited, like madly rushing out of the dark night to find everything we needed. Gradually, I passed the short night that was about to dawn, dimly and trembling. At eight o'clock in the morning, the arrogant voice of the city awakened me again, so constantly passing these boring days.</p>
<p>However, I need the gentle and tender red morning sun. I am not willing to bury my youth in the silent circle forever.</p>
<h3>A Village Woman's Night</h3>
<p>— Ding Lang</p>
<p>The sound of crying,</p>
<p>Ripples through the tattered cotton wadding;</p>
<p>Yearning for her mother's milk.</p>
<p>The lamplight spills on her hands,</p>
<p>Needle and thread try to capture the fleeing night,</p>
<p>A flurry of busyness!</p>
<p>The cold wind creeps in through the door cracks,</p>
<p>Making the flame flicker,</p>
<p>Exhaustion wrings out her husband's snores,</p>
<p>Tilling the fields has drained his spirit,</p>
<p>Her eyes glance over,</p>
<p>And a hardened heart urges on her own toil!</p>
<h3>Visiting the Sick</h3>
<p>— Yier</p>
<p>Knowing full well that visiting hours for ordinary hospital patients only start at three in the afternoon, I always arrive at the hospital by half past two. It’s not that I’m impatient, but standing and waiting aimlessly at the hospital entrance, letting those long thirty minutes, second by second, drive me crazy, is something I really can’t bear. But why do I go early? There’s a reason for my early arrival. I feel that even though I’m anxious waiting outside, inside room number twenty-one of the hospital, there's a very seriously ill patient who, during the twenty-four hours of the day, is even more anxiously awaiting the arrival of three o’clock in the afternoon, and hoping that I’ll visit her and give her a little comfort! Moreover, waiting while standing at the hospital entrance is much better than sitting at home waiting. Because arriving at the hospital a little earlier and looking inside from the outside feels like seeing her a little earlier, and my heart feels a lot lighter. Therefore, I am very willing to endure this half-hour of pain every day, not daring to arrive even a little later.</p>
<p>Time passes minute by minute with the shadow of the sun on the ground, and people visiting patients arrive one after another. Some mothers visit their daughters, some husbands visit their wives, and some friends visit friends. Each visitor brings more or less some food, such as side dishes, biscuits, fruit, and milk. The feelings of these people are different. Those with faces full of sorrow, one can tell at a glance that the patients they are visiting are in very serious condition. Those with joyful expressions between their brows and eyes undoubtedly have relatives who are already on the mend and no longer need medicine. As for the few who are visiting new mothers, they mostly look very happy. Perhaps some of them are happy to be fathers, and some are happy to be grandfathers or grandmothers.</p>
<p>Every day when I go to the hospital, I also bring some things as usual: oranges, bread, and ham. In addition, I carry a heavy heart. Every day because I arrive early, I first put the things on the table in the gatehouse, put my hands in the left and right pockets of my coat, and pace back and forth outside the gate alone. At this time, nothing but extremely terrifying shadows emerge. Before my eyes is her gray, pale, and thin face, and in my ears are her intermittent and miserable cries. However, unreliable wishful thinking is not absent either. Perhaps after taking the medicine, she is a little better today? Perhaps after the injection, she is now sleeping comfortably? Perhaps the vomiting has stopped, and she can eat? However, among these many "perhaps," there is another "perhaps" that I dare not imagine, which is: perhaps she has unfortunately… Thinking like this, three o’clock finally arrives. As soon as the gate opens, the group of people standing at the gate rush in like a tide. As soon as I step into the gate, my heart becomes confused and uneasy. The closer I get to the ward, the faster my heart beats. Room number twenty-one is already in front of me. I walk in in one breath, open my flustered eyes, look at the patient lying on the bed, and the first thing I say is: "How are you today?" If the answer is: "A little better!" my heart feels like a lead weight has been lifted, and immediately calms down! If she holds my hand and sobs sadly, then my heart feels like it's being stabbed with a knife, and I instantly feel an unusual ache!</p>
<p>Two hours pass in a flash, and we have to separate temporarily again. I reluctantly leave this patient in the quiet hospital and walk home alone. Meeting again after twenty-two hours feels farther away than a year; it’s really hard to wait! What makes me most uneasy is: what state will she be in tomorrow?</p>
<h3>Mr. Ju Qing (10)</h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>What makes him slightly dissatisfied now is that group of students, obviously of varying quality. Strict control was originally Mr. Ju Qing's only educational principle, but now this principle is gradually becoming somewhat ineffective. The students transferred from the district primary school are invariably naughty, love to make trouble, are good at causing mischief, and do not submit to the teacher's control: as long as Mr. Ju Qing leaves the study for even a step, there will immediately be disputes, adding much annoyance to his life.</p>
<p>This academic atmosphere should be rectified, he thought.</p>
<p>Among the newly arrived students, the most stubborn and recalcitrant is Shen Qingzhong. This child spends almost all of his time playing naughty games and can barely sit still for a moment. Since he arrived, it seems that many students have been influenced by him and have become restless. To make an example of one to warn a hundred, Mr. Ju Qing decided to start rectifying the academic atmosphere with this child.</p>
<p>However, the strict management method that Mr. Ju Qing has used effectively for twenty years has lost its effectiveness on Shen Qingzhong.</p>
<p>This child's mischievousness seems to be innate, and his temperament is as tough as rawhide glue. Every time he is found to have broken the rules and is brought before him, he stands in front of you like a wooden stake. No matter how much you scold him, how harshly and loudly you rebuke him, he always clenches his teeth and stubbornly refuses to open his mouth. As soon as you finish scolding him, he turns around and immediately sticks out his tongue and makes faces at his classmates. Back in his seat, he still secretly engages in his naughty deeds, and even if you make him kneel in front of Confucius's spirit tablet, he will grin and giggle with a shameless face.</p>
<p>As a last resort, Mr. Ju Qing decided to use the corporal punishment of his greatest authority.</p>

<h3>The Sixth National Games Preparatory Committee Held Its First Meeting Yesterday, Appointing Chairman Lin and Chairman Jiang, Among Others, as Honorary Presidents, Deciding on the Candidates for the Competition and Judging Committees, and Stipulating the Deadline for Submitting the List of Participating Events from Various Regions, and the First Meeting of the Preparatory Committee Will Be Held This Friday, and the Overall Championship Will Be Maintained</h3>
<p>The Sixth National Games, scheduled to be held in the downtown area of the city on this year's Double Tenth Festival, the Preparatory Committee held its first meeting at the City Hall meeting room at 12:00 noon yesterday to discuss various arrangements. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Attending Committee Members</p>
<p>Wang Shijie, Chu Minyi, Wang Zhengting (represented by Shen Siliang), Zhang Boling, Wu Tiecheng, Yu Hongjun, Pan Gongzhan, Chen Kuisheng (represented by Jiang Xiangqing), Song Ruhai, Yang Hu (represented by Wang Chengzhi), Cai Jingjun, Cai Zengji, Xu Peihuang, Li Ting'an, Shen Yi, Dong Dayou, Hao Gengsheng, Zhang Jiong, Lei Zhen, Xu Yiqiao, Tong Xingbai, Wang Xiaolai, Du Yuesheng (represented by Wang Xiaolai), Shen Siliang, Yuan Dunli, Wu Yunrui, Ma John, Xu Minhui, Cheng Dengke, Pan Youqiang (represented by Cheng Dengke), Jiang Xiangqing, Chen Yongxing, Li Dachao, Ma Chonggan, Shao Rugan, Jiang Jianbai, Chen Shizhen (represented by Wu Yunrui), etc.</p>
<p>Chairman's Report</p>
<p>Chairman Minister Wang, Recorder Wang Daxu, with the formalities observed, first the Chairman reported, briefly stating that today's first preparatory meeting for the Sixth National Games is being held in Shanghai. According to the decision of the Executive Yuan, the National Games are held every four years in rotation between the central government and various provinces and cities, that is, this committee meets every two years, once in the central government and the next time in the provinces and cities. This year the conference is being held in Shanghai for two reasons: (1) Because the Shanghai Municipality proposed it after the last conference, in order to promote the construction of a sports ground in Greater Shanghai. (2) Because Shanghai Municipality won the championship and had the best results. Now there are only five or six months left before the conference, and the time is extremely pressing. It is hoped that after this meeting, the directors of each group will work hard to prepare and proceed, and that the representatives from remote areas will participate in the representatives, which will increase compared with the previous conference. There are two experiences gained from the last conference: (1) The issue of participating units and the number of people, that is, the principle of popularity. In this session, the participating units and the number of people in remote areas can be increased compared with the previous session. (2) Regarding the issue of funding, it is hoped that this session can achieve the effect of popularity with relatively less expense. The above points are personal feelings and are specially contributed to the members of the preparatory committee for reference.</p>
<p>Mayor's Speech</p>
<p>Next, Mayor Wu delivered a speech, briefly stating that it is a great honor for the Sixth National Games to be held in this city. As for the various preparations, since the Ministry of Education has entrusted them, it is incumbent upon us. However, having undertaken the preparations, I feel deeply afraid, because this city is the gateway to the capital, and my colleagues are humble and inexperienced, and the preparations may be inadequate, so I have to hope that the Central Ministry of Education and everyone will give instructions at any time, so as to serve as a guide.</p>
<p>Honorary Presidents</p>

<p>Funding and Other Items</p>
<p>(VIII) The budget proposal for the conference expenses, resolved that the director of the preparatory committee should consult with the Ministry of Education and then submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval. (IX) The proposal on whether to cancel the overall championship of the conference, resolved that the original proposal should be maintained and not cancelled. (X) The proposal on whether to amend the tennis championship competition rules, resolved to hand it over to the original proposer to draft the revised provisions and submit them to the Standing Committee for discussion.

(XII) Send letters to the Ministries of Communications and Railways to reduce or exempt the cost of train and ship tickets for the selected athletes. How to handle the reduction or exemption limit and procedures? Resolved to handle it according to the precedents of the previous session. (XIII) Should international competitions be invited to be held by overseas Chinese in Shanghai after the conference is over? Resolved not to submit it for discussion for the time being. (XIV) The proposal to request that Tai Chi exercises be stipulated as a group performance at the opening ceremony of this conference, resolved and passed.</p>
<p>Registration Date</p>

<h3>Director Wu Broadcasts Speech: Reading Movement and the Chinese Revolution</h3>
<p>The National Reading Movement Conference, sponsored by the Chinese Cultural Construction Association, began yesterday. Chen Lifu, chairman of the association, gave the opening speech of the National Reading Movement Conference at the Nanjing Central Broadcasting Station. In Shanghai, Wu Xingya, director of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, gave a speech on "Reading Movement and the Chinese Revolution" at the Sino-Western Radio Station from 3:01 PM to 3:30 PM yesterday afternoon. The full text of his speech is as follows:</p>
<p>Wu's Speech: Ladies and gentlemen, recently, the Chinese Cultural Construction Association launched a national reading movement. The publicity in newspapers and the response from all walks of life are truly remarkable, and a reading atmosphere has quickly formed. I believe that this movement is a very valuable movement in the process of the Chinese revolution. Today, the Cultural Construction Association asked me to broadcast, so I will discuss the topic of "Reading Movement and the Chinese Revolution" with everyone.</p>
<p>The current stage of the Chinese revolution, as we all know, is the period of political tutelage from a political perspective, and the period of construction from an economic perspective. The meaning of political tutelage is to train the people to exercise political power and complete Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of Democracy. The meaning of construction is to promote national economic facilities and improve the people's economic lives, completing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Principle of People's Livelihood. This work is the most difficult and most important in the process of the revolution. We must complete this work in order to guarantee the glory of past revolutionary movements and to achieve the success of future revolutionary movements. Unfortunately, in this stage of the revolutionary movement, we have encountered</p>
<p>extreme resistance. In terms of foreign relations, our country is subjected to increased oppression and is still in a semi-colonial status. In terms of domestic affairs, bandits have not been completely eliminated, which has dispersed our revolutionary forces. And foreign economic aggression, rural bankruptcy, and industrial and commercial decline have formed a serious economic national crisis. Our revolutionary movement has been hit by this. How can we break through the current difficulties? How can we solve this economic national crisis? This requires every revolutionary to use our knowledge to solve this problem. Let's look at the facts before us. As I said before, the current stage of the Chinese revolution is political tutelage and construction. The success or failure of this work completely depends on the level of knowledge of the people.</p>
<p>According to expert statistics, the Chinese illiterate population accounts for more than 70% of the total population. These illiterate people cannot even write their own names. How can we ask them to exercise the four powers? When it comes to construction, modern material construction must be based on science, but there is a lack of domestic talent. We have to rely on foreign technical experts. Foreign experts often do not fully understand our country's national conditions, and their plans may not be suitable for our needs. From this, we can learn a lesson: cultivating specialized talents and improving the national level of knowledge are prerequisites for completing the current stage of revolutionary work. Based on the above analysis, we can say that the reading movement has extremely important significance. The reading movement currently led by the Cultural Construction Association focuses more on promoting profound knowledge, rather than a widespread movement to eliminate illiteracy. This is because promoting profound knowledge is particularly important during the current construction period. We must cultivate</p>
<p>many talents and experts to engage in construction work. Dr. Sun Yat-sen said that the foundation of the revolution lies in profound knowledge. This is what he meant. Last year, the Japanese military published a booklet saying that future wars will be wars of the entire nation, wars of the intelligence of the people of both countries. It also stimulates people to engage in the pursuit of knowledge. In order to improve cultural standards, increase the national level of knowledge, and promote intellectual national defense, we must encourage the people to read and cultivate a good learning atmosphere among the people. We must encourage young people to devote themselves to academic studies and develop a national reading movement. This is a movement to relieve intellectual famine, a movement to cultivate national strength and change national destiny. As for the movement to eliminate illiteracy, in terms of</p>
<p>the central government, the Central Executive Committee has a three-year plan to eliminate illiteracy. In Shanghai, the municipal government has a People's Literacy Committee, which plans to eliminate all illiteracy in Shanghai within one year. The purpose of this movement to eliminate illiteracy is to raise the national level of knowledge and reduce the resistance to the revolution. If this national, unified promotion of the reading movement succeeds one day, when we talk about political tutelage and construction, we will inevitably be able to promote it without obstruction. Therefore, every one of our citizens should vigorously support and defend this movement. Finally, I respectfully wish the Cultural Construction Association's reading movement success, and I hope that the people of the whole country will work hard to promote the reading movement.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Holds Private School Registration; All Surveys Must Be Completed by the End of the Month</h3>
<p>The Municipal Education Bureau is holding registration for private schools throughout the city. It was originally planned to be completed last year, but because many tutors continued to apply for registration, it was postponed until the end of March of this year. A total of more than 600 people have applied to the bureau for registration. The Education Bureau believes that the city is vast and the survey is not easy. In order to complete it quickly, it has appointed Sun Shiju, Du Xi, Shen E, Qian Boxian, Liu Xuru, Zhou Hanbin, Zhang Ruli, Yao Zantang, Cheng Fengxiang, Zheng Buhong and other ten people as investigators to start the investigation separately from the 10th of this month, and all investigations must be completed before the 30th of this month. The Municipal Public Security Bureau has also been requested to instruct the various branch bureaus and police stations to assist in the investigation at any time.</p>
<h3>Municipal Education Bureau Pays Attention to Children's Hygiene and Allocates Funds to Subsidize Hygiene Expenses</h3>
<p>The number of children (students) in Gaohua District is 2,500. It is estimated that one-third suffer from trachoma and tinea capitis. If no measures are taken to treat them, they will spread in the future, which is very worrying. It has now been decided that the district health office will send doctors and train senior students to treat them, but the funds are very tight and it may have to stop. The Municipal Education Bureau has now allocated funds to continue the treatment. The school hygiene expenses in Gaohua District will also be subsidized by the Education Bureau.</p>
<h3>Dispute over Reorganization of Juyuan Elementary School; Lawyer Xu Yuan Released on Bail in Court</h3>
<p>Juyuan Elementary School, established by the Duck Industry Association of this city, had a dispute over reorganization. Initially, the old board of directors accused the current board of directors of embezzlement. Then, the current board of directors accused Xu Pu, the former principal of Juyuan, and Xu Yuan, the lawyer representing the old board, of instigating the lawsuit. The court opened yesterday morning. In court, it was revealed that in the lawsuit filed by the old board of directors, there was a person named Yu Sanlang who was not a duck merchant. This time, he suddenly obtained an invoice under the guise of selling chickens and filed a lawsuit, which is highly suspicious. It was believed that the lawyer Xu Yuan and others had a major suspicion of instigating the lawsuit. They were ordered to be released on bail and await investigation. It is heard that the court is paying close attention to this case and will investigate the Municipal Education Bureau and other places. (Dagon Society)</p>

<p>Spring and Autumn</p>
<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Fei Cun)</p>
<p>Only those who truly understand optimism have happiness; at the same time, only those who can truly cope with the environment have happiness. Although the environment in front of you is so bad, you should still know how to deal with the bad environment in front of you. Otherwise, what's the use of your daily sadness, moaning, and depression?</p>
<p>Many people are cursing the existing society, and some are even resentful of being born into the present society. How wrong is this! We should know, what is society? We should also understand, what is the composition of social organization? If we have a deep understanding of the entire society, at least the sins produced in society should be attributed to ourselves! (Fei Cun)</p>
<h3>She People</h3>
<p>— Shi Ming</p>
<p>The She people, also known as She Yao, were originally a branch of the Yao people, traditionally believed to be descendants of Pan Hu. Their ancestor is said to be a dragon dog. This myth is known to everyone in the She tribe. Who their ancestor really is, it is temporarily impossible to find any historical facts to break the fallacies in the legends. However, it can be determined that the Yao people migrated from Guangdong to Fujian, and from Fujian to Zhejiang.</p>
<p>The She people are divided into ten surnames: initially only the Pan, Lan, Lei, and Zhong surnames, later adding the Gou, Lou, Hu, and Hou surnames, and recently adding the Lin and Li families. Those who are distributed in the counties belonging to the old government of Quzhou in Zhejiang Province are mostly in Lishui and Suichang. It is estimated that there are 200,000 She people in Zhejiang. Those who are distributed in Fujian include Gutian, Changting, and other twenty counties. The number of people is unknown. In addition, there are also some She people in Hunan, Guangdong, and Yangyuan in Anhui.</p>
<p>Their marriage system is patrilineal, and they generally practice monogamy. Marriage within five generations is not allowed, and marriage is determined by the parents' orders and the matchmaker's words. However, their men and women are absolutely equal. Their funeral system is similar to that of the Han people, but when the deceased is put into the coffin, there is no wailing, but songs are sung instead. In the past, cremation was popular, but recently the burial methods of the Han people have gradually been adopted.</p>
<p>In the organization of the She people's families, whether men or women, they all have equal rights to enjoy the inheritance of property. They are rich in clan concepts and mostly live in clans. In the same community, there is a clan head in charge of rewards and punishments. Within the residential area, a covenant is established. If there is a violation of the rules, it must be punished after public discussion, and in severe cases, they are expelled from the area. However, they are strong in keeping faith, and violations of discipline are rarely seen.</p>
<p>The individual and social morality of the She people is better than that of the Han people. However, the Han people despise them very much. Therefore, there is a huge difference in the education and status of the She people. I hope the authorities will pay attention to this point.</p>
<h3>Nodding Off</h3>

<p>Nodding off is a very ordinary and trivial thing, but a careful study reveals that it also has some small value and interest.</p>
<p>The causes of nodding off are nothing more than "fatigue," "drowsiness," and "lack of energy"; and among them, there are distinctions of "climate," "constitution," and "habit": those related to climate generally nod off more easily in spring and summer than in autumn and winter, so there are ancient poems such as "Spring sleep unaware of dawn," "Lying high in the northern window, companions of Xi Huang," and "The summer sun is hot, just right for sleeping." Those related to constitution are generally easier for fat people to nod off than thin people. I don't know about the ancients, but just take the former military governor of Shaanxi, Hu Jingyi, as an example. His body was extraordinarily fat, and his skill in nodding off was also beyond the reach of ordinary people. He would even snore while sitting in the room talking to his staff. Those related to habit are generally lazy and comfortable people. Even if they get enough sleep at night, they are used to nodding off during the day, and they will fall asleep soundly at a certain time. In addition, there are special circumstances: such as lack of sleep at night, ...playing cards and drinking,... one will also nod off during the day; the shaking of boats and cars will also make people close their eyes and turn their heads to sleep.</p>
<p>Nodding off is not a good habit after all. I saw the ugly state of others nodding off in boats and cars, which made me afraid to try it myself. Some people's heads move with the bumps of the car, and their bodies also lean forward and backward. Sometimes, if one is not careful, one will fall to the ground, causing people to laugh out loud. Some people lie on their sides, limp, and fall on the body of a stranger, with saliva flowing an inch long, resulting in people hating them and scolding them severely.</p>
<p>"Where there is a will, iron can be made to blossom." To drive away this sleepy bug, you don't need spells or medicine, you just need to perk up your spirits, and it will retreat three times.</p>
<h3>Can Speak Only After Repair</h3>
<p>— Juan Yin</p>
<h3>Little West Heaven</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Nighttime Talk of Tragic Life, Originally a Dream, Footprints Scattered, the Wind and Rain Are Too Deceiving</p>
<p>It is now the morning of the day, and everyone is energetic. The lingering emotions of last night, those tragic and entangled events, are probably all forgotten. Everyone is again discussing the maiden Zhu Yueying. The rain is still falling steadily, and the eaves outside the glass window are like thick ropes, hanging down to the ground, never stopping. Even the glass is hit by water droplets, creating countless ripples. The water on the upper layer of the glass flows down in rows. Jia Duocai frowned and said, "This place in Xi'an is already boring enough. Adding to the rain, you can't even step out of the gate. How do you spend such long days?" Li Shilian said, "What are you busy with? Aren't you just going to be a matchmaker?" Jia Duocai laughed, "What you say is a little unreasonable. Matchmaking is just a hope, what way is there to regulate boredom." Huanhua glanced at him and laughed, "There's always a way, it's not difficult..." After saying these eight words, she immediately realized that what she had said was too ambiguous, and blushed and said, "Mr. Li, don't laugh, I haven't finished speaking. I was thinking that if I go find that girl, I will definitely be able to do it. Mr. Jia, why don't you order some dishes and some wine, so that I can eat and be happy to go matchmaking, okay? Moreover, that is what a matchmaker should ask for." Jia Duocai said yes, laughing, and went to get the paper and pen on the table, meaning to write out a menu. Li Shilian waved his hand and said, "Don't rush, let Miss Yang go and invite Miss Zhu over, and everyone can sit together and have a few drinks, wouldn't that be better?" Huanhua suddenly stood up and laughed, "Okay, I'll go. I know, their house is right behind here. I'll be back within an hour. You guys wait and see." As she spoke, she pointed to the tip of her nose, and then walked out with a smile. (176)</p>
<h3>Records of Fragrant Imperial Footwear</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Der Ling of Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The room for storing these phoenix shoes was also a very large side hall. The walls on all sides, from the ceiling to the floor, were all made of wooden boards into many wooden boxes, hundreds of rows without exaggeration. Each pair of phoenix shoes occupied a box, and the outside was numbered in order. In addition, there was a very thick book, which also recorded the same numbers, and under each number, the style, color, pattern, etc. of the pair of phoenix shoes were clearly noted; this book was kept by a female official who specialized in writing documents for the Empress Dowager. When the Empress Dowager was suddenly happy and wanted to change a pair of phoenix shoes, she would instruct this female official to send the book up for her to look through slowly; after she had decided, she only needed to say a number, and someone could immediately be sent to fetch the pair of new shoes she had chosen. Now that I think about it, it can be regarded as a scientific management method suitable for the principle of time economy!</p>
<p>The two eunuchs who specialized in keeping the phoenix shoes, of course, could not be regarded as craftsmen in the shoemaking industry, but only as one of the executive personnel in the palace. The so-called craftsmen in the shoemaking industry were another group of people, and they were also women, but they did not work as palace maids and could come and go freely. The work they undertook was indeed a specialized skill, which could not be done by ordinary people without training, but it was not very hard; from my perspective as an observer, it was as fun and interesting as the work done by other craftsmen in the palace. Among them, there were also two leaders who were responsible for management, who were two old women in their fifties.——In fact, they were not old women, but old maids; they were hired into the palace when they were very young.

<h3>More Strange Surnames</h3>
<p>— Wan Gong</p>
<p>The author published an article "Records of Strange Surnames" in this column last time. Later, a citizen named Yan came up with a sequel; there were many strange surnames collected in it, and it was very humorous; not to mention anything else; the honorable surname of citizen Yan is strange enough. In this time of "national affairs, what do I care about", it is more interesting to study this than to "play mahjong"! Therefore, I do not hesitate to bother, and come up with another one, and I hope that Mr. Shou Juan, who "holds the pen of the Spring and Autumn Annals", will give us a little convenience and lend a corner of the land, so that everyone can collect it together, or we can compile a sequel to "Hundred Family Surnames". I now supplement five: (Tai) There used to be a classmate named Tai Fen in the Shaoguan Military Academy, who was from Yunnan. According to him, he was a descendant of Tai Si. (Dan) When I was working in Lu'an the year before last, I met a Mr. Dan Xiping, who is a celebrity in the Anhui education circle. (You) It is not the "Zhu Qin You Xu" You, it has one less dot than the You character, pronounced Wang, and is a radical in the dictionary. There is a doctor You Pengxi on Baike Road. (Xin) Recently, a lawyer Xin Yida from Hangzhou came, and he published a large advertisement for his opening in the newspaper. His name is very strange. (Kui) There is a celebrity in Shanghai, Mr. Kui Yanfang. This surname is also rarely seen elsewhere. There are also the surnames (Fang), (Lou), (Chu), (Shu), and (Di), which I have all seen, but I can't name them for a while.</p>
<h3>Peach and Plum Calamity</h3>
<p>— (Xia Hu)</p>
<p>Our Gan Nanbei Lake is surrounded by peach and plum trees. When the flowers bloom, the red clouds and white snow reflect each other, which is very interesting. This lake is famous for its peach blossoms, and can be directly named Peach Blossom Lake. In the spring of previous years, tourists flocked here, and the local farmers by the lake guided tourists to visit, making a little progress. This year, there are few tourists, and the ill-fated peach blossoms have suffered from wind, fog, frost, and snow. Before they bloom, they fall. Those who pass by only see desolation and the people look emaciated. According to the farmers, "If a hundred flowers are frosted, the harvest is disappointing!" Last year there was a drought, and the farmers hoped for a bumper harvest of broad beans, peas, flowers, and fruits this spring to slightly restore the damaged vitality. Now that the peach and plum trees have suffered a calamity and a hundred flowers have withered early, the people will see even greater difficulties.</p>

<h3>Begging Art</h3>
<p>— Huang Yingdai</p>
<p>Carrying Twelve Pounds in Gold</p>
<p>In London or other important cities in England, vagrants and beggars with artistic skills can sometimes be fortunate enough to accumulate a lot of property. Recently, a beggar was arrested by the police in the west of London for begging with twelve pounds of gold on him and was sentenced to three months' imprisonment. In court, the beggar complained that he was very poor and almost unable to make a living, so he begged. However, the judge later found twelve pounds of property on him and sentenced him to three months in prison and asked him to pay five pounds for living expenses while in prison.</p>
<p>Holding a Banquet After Death</p>
<p>William Stevenson was the famous "King of Scottish Beggars." When he was dying, he wrote a will to hold a grand banquet to entertain all the beggars with the art of begging, so that they could all come and kiss his remains while he was lying in state, so that he could die in peace. This grand banquet was truly amazing. A total of three warehouses were rented, and thirty sheep were slaughtered to serve as dishes for the guests. In addition, countless beers were consumed, and there were more than eight gallons of the best whiskey. It can be seen that this banquet cost a lot of money!</p>
<p>A Legacy of Three Thousand Pounds</p>
<p>Cha Aaron, this poor man was a famous beggar in London. He wore a very long fake beard on his face, and most people knew that he had not enjoyed sleeping in a bed for fifty years, in other words, he slept on the ground every day. But after he died, he left a legacy of three thousand pounds.</p>
<p>Son is a College Student</p>
<p>But here is an even more ingenious beggar named Tem France. He sent his son to Edinburgh University with the money he begged for. His begging method was to hold two pockets in his hand. If a kind gentleman put a coin into one of his pockets, he would pay attention to another and give the same alms, and he would say, "My son is studying at the university, please help him with some tuition!" It is also a very interesting thing for the father to beg and provide his son's tuition at the university, right? People will be happy to donate after hearing him without having to beg. Later, this young man once entered the cabinet, and when he died, he was already old. In England, this matter is still spread as a good story.</p>
<p>Donated a Huge Legacy</p>
<p>Banaeov Ning was a famous Irish beggar who begged for two thousand five hundred pounds in his lifetime. He wrote a will stating that after his death, he would use this huge amount of money to help the poor among his relatives and friends, but a pastor advised him to donate it to a charity in Rome, so he listened to the pastor and donated it all. Later, the church often talked about this beggar's great deed, saying that although he was dead, he was still glorious and worthy of it.</p>

<h3>Financial Buying Interest Weakens, Gold Bidding Sellers Show Their Might, Down Eight Yuan Four - Retreating to Seventy Yuan</h3>
<p>The gold market has been succumbing to selling pressure for consecutive days, and yesterday's market was no exception. Although the foreign exchange market did not loosen, the buying side of the gold market was weak, with no activity at all. Once there was a supply of funds, there was a lack of maintenance, and the result was very sluggish. In the early morning, the London and New York silver markets both rose, and the Menterie forward silver price also rose. The exchange rate did not fluctuate much, and the London spot gold rose by two and a half pence. People's hearts were tired, and the off-site pre-trading opened, slightly retreating to seventy-three or four yuan. Unexpectedly, the sellers were eager and lacked maintenance, and immediately fell. The Central Bank's official quotations were announced, with both the United States and the United Kingdom being flat, and the customs gold unit rose by three cents. The standard price of the gold bid rose to 900 yuan and 1 jiao, slightly turning steady. After the low opening in the morning, it broke the 70 yuan mark. However, because the banks took advantage of the cheap price to buy, the buying side took advantage of the low price to act, and there was a slight rebound. However, the domestic market was sluggish and there was still a fall. The HSBC Bank's official quotations were announced, with both the United States and the United Kingdom being flat, and the market situation turned mediocre. Buyers were once active and rebounded slightly, but the rise was only temporary. Soon it became a hover again, and there were few transactions. There was a lack of special changes for quite a long time. Unexpectedly, the central government closed again, and large households took advantage of the situation to slightly sell, lacking maintenance. The foreign exchange market also hardened accordingly. Under the observation of buyers, it broke the 70 yuan mark again. Although there was a small trading in the middle, the buying interest was sluggish and the trend was weak. The market fell again after the market opened, but the buying side was seen to be still inactive, so it was able to maintain. The initial report of the Indian silver rose by 2.4.3 anna, in a hovering state. After entering, the news of Sassoon wanting to buy a shilling again arose, and the foreign exchange market tightened once and rebounded. The second report of the Indian silver was flat, slightly stable. However, people's hearts could not last, so although it rose after entering, it still fell. Buyers did not dare to act rashly, and the market was tired again at the close. It was difficult for the market to cheer up all day. In the middle, the rumors of borrowing money helped the retail investors' selling pressure. Now I will record the market situation of the day.</p>
<p>The opening in the morning was 871 yuan and a half, a decrease of two yuan and a half from last Saturday. Da Decheng, Qingfa, Yongdafa, and Yong sold strips, falling to 69 yuan and 2 jiao.

Yuanchang, Yongyuanmao, Yongdafa, and Yong sold off, falling to 69 yuan and 7 jiao. Knowing that HSBC's official quotations were flat in the UK and the US, people's hearts were still stable. Yuqing, Yongheng, Yu Fu, Yu Chang, Da Da, Decheng, etc. came in, rising to 72 yuan and 2 jiao. Qianchang, Xiangheng, Yu took the opportunity to sell at a high price, retreating to zero or four jiao. At this time, there were not many transactions, which was extremely mediocre. Fuxing, Yonghengxing, etc. slightly accepted, rising to two yuan. Shengda, Richang, Yifeng, Yongdasheng, Yongfeng, Chunyuan, Yonghuixiang, etc. sold off one after another, falling to 68 yuan and 3 jiao. The British bought half a penny shilling in June.

Yuanheng and Changda Fuyu still sold, and fell to 5. After entering, Mitsui and Jiayou bought 625 US dollars in June.

Fuyu, Fuxing, Yongchangda, Wanfeng Hongxing, etc. sold off one after another, but it was still difficult to maintain, and gradually fell to 5 yuan and 4 jiao. By the time the market closed at 865 yuan and 6 jiao, Huixiang and Dadafa Yong, etc. sold off and slightly frustrated. Checking the highest price of the day at 872 yuan and 2 jiao, and the lowest price at 865, there were 7 yuan and 2 jiao up and down. As a result, it fell by 8 yuan and 4 jiao compared to last Saturday.</p>

According to the closing price, it was about 34 yuan lower, 10 yuan weaker than last Saturday. The account registration for this month was 864 yuan, and for May it was 867 yuan. The morning supplementary water was 864 yuan, and the afternoon supplementary water was 863 yuan. The price of pure gold was still about 4 yuan higher, at 875 yuan and a half. Spot goods have not yet been traded. Tianjin goods are about 7 yuan higher, lacking sellers, the source is not smooth, and the inventory is normal, so the public orders are not actively solved. In addition to the public orders, there are only 196 strips left for this month, with a total of eight long parties and two short parties.</p>
<p>The trading in the market was scattered. In summary, Chunyuanyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yuqingyong, Qingfayong, Yuanheng, Renfayong, Richang, Yiyu, Shengda, Qianchangxiang, Yuanchangyong were on the selling side, and Dadafayong, Huixiangfuyu, Yifengyongheng, Changyongdadecheng, Hengxingwanxing, etc. were on the buying side.

Although it loosened after opening, the banks bought cheaply, and the situation was still flat. Banks did business with each other. HSBC's official quotations were announced, with both the UK and the US being flat. After that, it was extremely mediocre, and there were few transactions. It hovered and was very stable. Later, Chinese merchants' psychology became more timid, and the central government still blocked it. Banks did not have much acceptance. The process gradually tightened and loosened. The market continued to harden. Banks took the opportunity to buy US dollars cheaply. The first report of the Indian silver rose by 2.4.3 anna, and hovered.

Compared to last Saturday, the British exchange loosened 09375 and the US exchange hardened 25.

<h3>Securities: Bond Market Rises After Holiday, Nine Sixes Have Demands for Consolidation, Said To Be Rising As Much As Seven Or Eight Jiao</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Stock Exchange resumed its normal opening after the Spring Festival holiday. Although there were no major changes in the environment, the air of borrowing pounds was getting stronger. There were rumors in the financial sector that the nine-six public bonds had a demand for consolidation. As a result, the table gradually tightened, and new bulls gradually started. However, the shorts were still struggling, and there were few offsets. Yesterday's situation was that nine-six was firm and slightly higher in the morning, and more households entered in the afternoon. Because there were too few sellers, most of them could not satisfy their appetite. Today there may be a grand occasion. Other types of bonds, because there is hope for foreign debt, the table is also in excess of supply, and the shorts have slightly transferred periods. Most of them are firm and slightly higher. Thirty-two, thirty-four, and forty-three, etc., have all been bought, and fourteen and seventeen have been sold slightly. In summary, the market price results, nine-six alone rose by seven jiao to eight and a half jiao, because its bottom price was very low, and speculators could easily get started.

<h3>Yarn Flower: Futures Market Closed for Holiday, Yarn Sales Still Manageable, Sparse Cotton</h3>
<p>The cotton yarn market situation is still stable. Due to some factories already lacking spot supply, they are even rationing shipments of coarse yarn, which is encouraging. Market prices remain solid. During these two days of market closure, spot yarn trading among merchants is still being maintained, but demand from various parties is not very robust. Yarn futures are still closed due to the Spring Festival holiday. Merchants bought a total of 315 bales of spot yarn, with prices remaining flat. On the 6th, 135 bales were traded, and on the 5th, an additional 445 bales were traded. The breakdown of today's transactions by merchant and bale amount is as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangxi: 50, Guangdong: 25, Inland: 5</p>
<p>Changsha: 15, Henan: 51, Fujian: 5</p>
<p>Shantou: 40, Wuhu: 25, Colleagues: 5</p>
<p>The cotton market is in a dull state. Overseas U.S. and Indian cotton prices have slightly increased, but silver prices have risen, gold prices have fallen, and exchange rates have been extended. The calculated price is still flat. In addition, cotton inventories in various regions are too high, and the pressure on cotton prices is difficult to eliminate in the short term. The amount of spot cotton purchased by factories remains small. During these two days of cotton futures market closure, factory purchases have not been announced.</p>
<h3>Grains: Foreign Indica Rice Gradually Increases, Thick Japonica Showing Signs of Rising</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, the number of sources from various merchants was still only about twenty (totaling nearly 4,000 piculs of goods). Sales were normal due to rain, but with scarce arrivals in recent days, sentiment is somewhat improved. Prices for thick Japonica rice have already increased slightly. The late rice market, with only about 200 bags purchased by the Weihaiwei merchants, seemed slightly inferior to thick Japonica rice, rising only a few cents. Du Jian and Yin Bian Wu rice did not fluctuate much. (North Shanghai) Yesterday, the sky was overcast and rainy. There were only twelve or thirteen sources from various waterways. The market was quiet, and the market price of white Japonica rice rose a few cents. Early rice prices increased by ten cents. The other goods remained roughly the same as before.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Yesterday, foreign rice initially remained stable. After continuous increases in recent days, importers may be hesitant to observe the market. The rising trend seems to have stabilized. However, yesterday Japanese merchants were again eager to purchase rice, actively buying foreign Indica rice in the market and showing strong interest in high-quality foreign rice. Inland merchants continued to purchase various grades of secondary rice, so market prices again rose by five or six cents. Foreign Indica rice, competed for by local and inland merchants, is gradually running out of stock, and supply has long been cut off, making the market even tighter. The total daily volume of Saigon small-grain and Siamese rice reached around 20,000. There were futures market buybacks of 300 tons of Saigon rice and 2,000 bags of foreign Indica rice.</p>
<h3>Forward Flour and Wheat Rise Due to Rain</h3>
<p>Flour: Yesterday, after the opening of the flour market, foreign wheat prices fluctuated. However, spot flour remained scarce as before, and actual sales continued steadily. Yesterday, Northern China also made purchases for near and far months, and because the weather was overcast and rainy, which harmed the wheat seedlings, outside speculators were very eager to buy. All factories unanimously refused to sell, and short sellers were anxious to cover their positions. Therefore, opening prices were high, gradually increasing throughout the afternoon. The closing price for this month was up 7.5 cents, for next month up 1.75 cents, for June up 3 cents, and for July to September up 3.25 cents.</p>
<p>Wheat: Yesterday, the wheat market remained stable in the morning sessions. Both closing positions and covering shorts were balanced, and there was little competition from various parties. In the afternoon, outside speculators actively purchased forward contracts, as recent rains damaged the wheat seedlings, and sentiment was generally bullish. Far months, being the standard for new wheat, were even tighter. Closing prices for July and August were up 4 to 5 cents. Near-term contracts even declined slightly by 1 cent for closing positions, but spot wheat was very scarce, and factory demand was strong. 5,000 bags were traded yesterday, purchased by the Fu and Fu major factories. High-quality wheat was priced from $3.82 to $3.80, and secondary wheat was priced at $3.70.</p>
<h3>Observations on the Future of U.S. Wheat</h3>
<p>A report from New China Foreign Company on the U.S. wheat situation states that winter wheat is now in the spring growth months, and the lack of moisture to date is very significant. The southwestern hard winter wheat belt is particularly at risk of drought. Although it is still too early to predict a wheat crop failure, the poor condition of winter wheat entering spring is undeniable.</p>
<p>In recent years, domestic supply in the United States has been drastically reduced. When the current crop year, which began in July 1935, started, U.S. wheat stocks will fall to the so-called "statistical norm or safe stock" level. Therefore, if there is another crop failure this year, it could have serious consequences. The current supply is clearly not excessive. If it were to be heavily depleted, it would be necessary to import bread wheat. The domestic supply situation in the United States is listed as follows:</p>
<p>Domestic Supply (Unit: 1 Million Bushels)</p>
<p>Crop Year July 1 Stocks Winter Wheat Spring Wheat Total Supply Consumption June 30 Stocks</p>
<p>1931-32 324 818 114 1,256 874 382</p>
<p>1932-33 382 476 268 1,126 740 386</p>
<p>1933-34 386 352 176 913 622 291</p>
<p>1934-35 291 401 96 788 ×655 ×133</p>
<p>× Estimated numbers</p>
<p>Crop production on the Great Plains west of the 100th meridian is entirely limited by moisture. Sufficient rainfall in late summer and autumn is the source of soil moisture supply. When wheat growth is most active and water is insufficient to meet its needs, seedlings absorb this moisture and rely on it for growth. Therefore, the large accumulation of subsoil moisture is related to wheat crops as savings are to a person's bank account. Rainfall in the U.S. hard winter wheat belt from July to the end of September last year was minimal.</p>
<p>Winter wheat planting starts from mid-September and continues until the end of November. During this period, abundant rainfall allows the seeds to germinate and the seedlings to establish. Well-rooted seedlings are more resistant to winter cold, wind, and soil changes than those that are not firmly rooted. From October 3 last year to February 26 this year, the western wheat-growing region has not received its normal moisture supply. In fact, most of the rainfall in the southwest is less than 50% of what it was during this period in previous years. Recent reports of severe dust storms indicate that there is still a lack of adequate moisture.</p>
<p>The situation in the eastern winter wheat belt is generally satisfactory, but the situation in the western region is quite different. Due to the lack of moisture in the subsoil, the future harvest will depend entirely on the weather from now until harvest time. For a bumper harvest, rainfall must be widespread and well distributed. According to estimates by Department of Agriculture officials, winter wheat on the western Great Plains requires 121% more moisture than normal from now until harvest time, and they say that there is only a 20% chance of this happening.</p>
<p>It is still too early to discuss the outlook for spring wheat, but we must point out that most spring wheat areas also lack adequate rainfall, resulting in lower than average subsoil moisture.</p>
<p>To achieve average production, rainfall in the coming months must be more than usual and timely. Last year's drought is still fresh in our memories. The supply of wheat this year is not only gradually decreasing, but this year's harvest will also face a confirmed threat. If the situation does not improve in the short term, the seeds of a crop panic will be sown for the coming months.</p>

<h3>Sudden Surge in Sales Leads to Sharp Rise in Soybeans</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the soybean market situation was even stronger than last week. Since the Guangdong merchants made large purchases on Sunday (buying over 20 truckloads of soybeans), market prices have become tight. Yesterday's market prices were up by one dime to seven or eight cents compared to the previous day. Current inventories are insufficient. If the merchants continue to demand soybeans, further price increases are possible. Transactions included 16-17 truckloads of Fanjiatun soybeans purchased by Guangdong merchants at prices of $4.40 and $4.35, 3 truckloads of Sipingjie soybeans at a price of $4.30, 2 truckloads of Tancheng soybeans at a price of $3.99, 2 truckloads of Yingzhou soybeans at a price of $3.65/$3.62, over 800 bags of Hankou truck soybeans at a price of $3.95, over 1,000 bags of Hankou late soybeans at prices ranging from $3.63 to $3.41, 1 truckload of Haozhou soybeans traded by oil mills at a price of $3.48, 1 truckload of Bengbu soybeans at a price of $3.39, 200 bags of Shashi soybeans purchased by local merchants at a price of $3.48, 1 truckload of Zhengyangguan soybeans at a price of $3.60, and over 500 bags of Hankou Zha soybeans at prices ranging from $3.70 to $3.52.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Gradual Decline in U.S. Sales of Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>Trade in Chinese tea with the United States has always been important. In recent years, affected by competition from Japanese tea, the amount of red and green tea imported into the United States has decreased from more than 300,000 cases to 70,000 to 80,000 cases. According to recent news from foreign firms, Japanese and Taiwanese red and green teas are competing even more fiercely. Due to Japanese business propaganda, the U.S. government is extremely discriminatory towards Chinese tea imports. The standards set are not the same as for tea from Java and Japan. Tea chests that are broken, tea leaves that are stained, and those that contain a smoky flavor will all be prohibited from import.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: Batch of Guangdong Coarse White Sugar Sold - Slightly Higher Than Before</h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market trend was firm. The Sugar Industry Cooperative Corporation sold 2,900 bags of Guangdong coarse white sugar. (1) 1,217 bags of high-quality sugar, with a bid price of $17.50, an increase of ten cents. (2) 900 bags of slightly lower quality, priced at $17.35, an increase of five cents. (3) 783 bags of lower quality, priced at $17.30. All were sold. Furthermore, the Guangzhou Shanghai Zhenhua Company opened with 100 bags of Five Rams brand milled white sugar at $17, and 45 bags of Guangzhou Ice at $22.20. Chaoqing continued to open with only over 300 bags, with Premium Green at $10.80, Superior Green at $10.60, and Huanggang Green at $10.40. The factory's cotton white Zhenyu No. 1 remained at $17, with no increase or decrease from before. The market outlook is firm. (Yesterday's Cuban raw sugar inventory should be corrected from no increase or decrease to a decrease of 135).</p>
<p>Also, the guild's market price for high-quality raw sugar was $17.50, but there were no transactions. Imported goods were said to be offered at $5.60, with slight trading, up cents compared to the previous day (6th).</p>
<h3>Metals: Ribbed Steel Bars Show Exceptional Strength</h3>
<p>Yesterday's rainy weather greatly reduced the volume of physical metal transactions due to transportation difficulties. However, ribbed steel bars saw a high level of transactions reaching 200 tons due to construction needs. Due to the tight credit situation and the upcoming end of April maturities, many were willing to sell at lower prices, causing the standard price to drop. Recent prices are estimated to be only around $103-104, and the lowest quality is estimated at only $98. There are reports of recent purchases from Qingdao, Xuzhou, and Pukou. Overseas prices have recently shown signs of easing, so local industry players have also seen a surge in orders.</p>

<p>Commentary</p>
<h3>Is This Kind of Abortion a Crime?</h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Reading the social news in the Shen Bao on the 4th, I was struck by this passage: Shen Chen, from Zhenjiang, worked as a servant in the home of a Japanese resident in this city. Recently, she became pregnant for three months, and fearing that her abdomen would gradually expand, making it difficult to work, or that she might be fired by her employer, she privately inserted a raisin into her lower body to induce an abortion. After the incident, the court sentenced her to two years in prison for abortion, with a suspended sentence.</p>
<p>After reading this article, my heart jumped, and I felt that the pressure of livelihood was truly terrifying. If this young woman had been fortunate enough to marry a wealthy man, she would have been overjoyed to be pregnant. Perhaps she would give birth to a little baby, and the couple would have a source of comfort. Her in-laws would be beaming with smiles and cherish her even more. However, she was unfortunate. Because her family was poor, she had to work as a maidservant to earn a few dollars to support her life. Selling her labor is not a problem, but now even the flesh in her womb must be aborted due to the pressure of life. Although her life was saved thanks to God's blessing, she could not escape a two-year sentence. Her plight is truly pitiful.</p>
<p>Abortion is cruel from a humanitarian perspective and a crime from a legal perspective. However, humanity and law are sometimes no match for the whip of life. There are many poor people in the world who secretly engage in this cruel and criminal act.</p>
<h3>Old Man Hu</h3>
<p>— Hua Mu</p>
<p>In the evening, Old Man Hu listlessly crawled out of the cabin. The river was calm and peaceful, sprinkled with soft sunlight. He looked up at the clouds on the horizon, his heart feeling like a rock was stuffed inside, heavy and stagnant. He aimlessly touched the iron nail-like whiskers on his chin, shook his head blankly, as if saying: Another day is over.</p>
<p>He staggered ashore. Behind the mountain, there was a thunderous sound of a car running over the muddy road, raising a cloud of yellow dust. Strangely, this cloud of yellow dust was like spitting out from the mouth of a python, rolling over the sky and earth towards him, causing Old Man Hu to feel chills. "It's over, this old bone!" He sighed deeply and turned into the small tavern on the right side of the dock.</p>
<p>The tavern was cold and desolate, and the wine stove was listless on the side. When Old Man Hu saw this desolation, he felt another pang of sadness, as if being teased by a general pressure. He drank strong wine, and his brain clearly turned over the old events.</p>
<p>He remembered himself starting to travel to the market boat in his twenties. The Jiaotang dock was lively every evening. A row of boats stretched across the river, with the bow of one boat biting the stern of another, their bellies heavily loaded. As soon as the boat stopped, his companions would wipe their faces in the river, put on clean jackets, and climb ashore in groups of three or five, all carefree. But now it has changed. Since a highway was built behind the mountain, monster-like cars sped through the day, raising mud and dust half the sky high, carrying full loads of market customers and goods every day. In less than half a month, the Jiaotang dock had suddenly turned into a wasteland after a fire, desolate and bleak. Four out of five taverns had closed, and the one remaining was gasping feebly. Old Man Hu's boat had stopped running at this time, and he leaned against the banyan tree on the left side of the dock, drinking river water in misery...</p>
<p>This irreversible and fatal blow did not confuse Old Man Hu. He understood that it was the highway behind the mountain that was to blame, stealing his rice bowl. So he felt chills in his heart when he heard the sound of cars and saw the yellow dust?</p>
<p>It's over. This old bone!</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The days slipped by in despair. Life and sorrow turned into two red-hot iron needles, piercing through Old Man Hu's heart. Several times, he wanted to simply kill the heart of the market boat, sell the boat, go back to his hometown to farm, sip thin porridge, and muddle through the days. But this idea would turn into a bubble from time to time, rising quickly and then bursting. His heart could not help but soften. His family of six had only five ancestral grain shares of dry land. If it weren't for this boat, they would have starved to death long ago. How could they have survived to this day? Thinking of this difficult moment, Old Man Hu put the wine bowl on his lips and stared blankly at the calm river, as if using all his strength to grab something floating on the surface of the water...</p>
<p>The sun was gone. The river and the mountains gradually pulled down the blurred night shadows. Old Man Hu drank the last bowl of wine with a sore throat.</p>
<p>The days slipped by quietly with the river, one day, two days... Under the banyan tree at Jiaotang Dock was empty, without Old Man Hu's boat.</p>
<h3>The Death of a Child</h3>
<p>— Li Ni</p>
<p>Lin has been a little abnormal lately: She hasn't looked in the mirror for days, tidied her messy, tangled hair; nor does she put on powder and rouge on her face, which is yellow and frightening like wax! She lies in bed all day long, weeping, soaking the pillow with her tears.</p>
<p>Ren also paces back and forth in the room, dejectedly, with his hands behind his back. His face has no luster, as if covered with a layer of dust, or like someone who has insomnia and doesn't get enough sleep at night. He often stops in front of the bed, watching Lin's shoulders rise and fall quickly, and listening to the faint sobs from her throat. He sits down, gently strokes her tangled hair, and mumbles——</p>
<p>"Lin, are you feeling bad? ... Honey, just pretend it never happened, don't be sad! ... Actually, living in this world is also suffering. We can't even fill our stomachs, how can we ...; "Ren's throat is also hoarse, and his voice is low and trembling.</p>
<p>Lin cries even more vigorously, her shoulders twitching rapidly, and her whole body trembling faintly.</p>
<p>With one less child in the family, the air is particularly silent and still! Little Lin has only been dead for three or four days, and the room is as quiet as an ancient temple in the deep mountains. Everything is dim, without a bit of life.</p>
<p>Normally, when Ren returns home from outside, Lin, holding Little Lin, would greet him with a smiling face: "Little Lin, call daddy, daddy bought candy for you." Then, Little Lin would stretch out her little hands to ask for candy, calling out simple sounds. At that time, Ren was also extremely happy. He would take the child from Lin's arms, tease her, and teach her to speak, forgetting the burden on his shoulders, forgetting the idleness and humiliation he had suffered outside. He forgot all the pain, leaving it clean and pure, and he felt that the air in the family was warm and joyful.</p>
<p>"But Little Lin is already dead." He thinks: His head swings like a pendulum.</p>
<p>However, in order to prevent Lin from being overly sad, he had to put on a smile and calmly comfort her——</p>
<p>"Lin, take it easy, get up! Let's go out to eat together, and then find a fun place to go for a walk. ... We're still young, maybe we'll have three or five more in the future. ..."</p>
<p>Lin still refuses to get up, continuing to sob.</p>
<p>Finally, Ren stood up again, lowering his head, with his hands behind his back, dragging his heavy feet, pacing back and forth in front of the bed, feeling suffocated!</p>
<p>He remembers Little Lin's chubby face, lively black eyes, who would roll out of bed as soon as it was dawn, peel open his eyelids, caress Lin's hair, and call out, "Daddy, Mommy."</p>
<p>"How could this lively little life wither away so quickly? ..." He secretly thought. At the same time, a wave of shame rolled up from his stomach, suffocating his heart, making him so painful that he could not stand still, and everything in front of him was spinning rapidly. He murmured madly:</p>
<p>"I'm really not qualified to be a father, I'm too irresponsible to the child! Little Lin only caught a cold, and there was no money to hire a doctor for her, so she lay in bed and died quietly!" He angrily grabbed the hair on his head, completely mad, staggered to the bed, threw himself into Lin's arms, and cried with Lin to his heart's content. ...</p>

<p>Opening piece: "The Kitchen God Goes to War"</p>
<p>The Kitchen God emperor sits on the kitchen stove. He relies on the incense smoke to have divine power. The main hall, mountains, and rivers are all within the stove. His mighty spirit is extraordinarily prominent. Suddenly, a cockroach scout brings military intelligence: 100,000 red ants are invading. General Camel has already gone to block them. Their momentum is like splitting bamboo, their courage extraordinary. The stove door has been opened. The soup pipe river has been defeated and retreated. The enemy forces will arrive at Stove Mountain any day now. The Kitchen God hears this and is filled with unbearable anger. He says, "I must personally lead the troops on a campaign." He rolls up the stove curtain and comes out into the courtyard. He sits on a firewood stool, wearing a coin helmet. His left hand holds fire tongs, his right hand wields a wok handle. The two armies meet six feet in front of the stove. The stove brick waves form the ranks. A fierce battle ensues, with no victor. The Kitchen God quickly unleashes his magic weapon. He scatters a handful of stove ash from his robe sleeve, burying the red ants in the ash heap. The ants were about to use their pincers to clamp the Kitchen God, causing him unbearable pain. He cries out, "Who can save me?" Fortunately, the warmed-up stove cat leaps out and performs a meritorious service. It reorganizes the small Jiangshan [territory] of the entire stove.</p>

<p>Zang Aibo Admonishes Gao Ding (Continued): "The thief who breaks through the gate, people do not blame him for sneaking and peeping; the prisoner who kills someone, people do not blame him for fighting and brawling. To summarize sneaking and peeping with breaking through the gate is a minor matter. To summarize fighting and brawling with killing someone is a minor crime. Duke Huan personally committed regicide and was not censured; how can he be blamed for taking one tripod from a rebellious person? It is appropriate that his advice was not accepted." From the former statement, it is disloyal; from the latter statement, it is unwise. One instance of advice embodies two failures. People say Aibo is virtuous; I do not believe it. Alas, Yan You's plan for dealing with the Xiongnu was an extraordinary plan, but gentlemen do not call it extraordinary because he told it to Wang Mang. Chen Zi'ang's memorial to the Mingtang was a loyal memorial, but gentlemen do not call it loyal because he told it to Empress Wu. Zang Aibo's admonishment about Shao Ding was loyal advice, but gentlemen do not call it loyal because he told it to Duke Huan. When observing a person's words, one should first consider the place where they are, and then listen to the words they utter. If one loses oneself in a region of usurpation and rebellion, even if there are loyal words and excellent plans, they will inevitably aid in the chaos. If Duke Huan had used Aibo's words and consistently followed legal principles, adhering to the idea of taking by rebellion but governing by righteousness, then there would have been no disaster of Peng Sheng, and Duke Yin's eyes would never have been closed in the underworld. Is Aibo's crime not great? I once said that Yu Fu's request to write a plan for Duke Huan to usurp the state and Aibo's advice to build a plan for Duke Huan to protect the state: Yu Fu started the chaos, Aibo completed the chaos. In justly naming and defining crimes, Aibo should not be placed below Yu Fu.</p>

<h3>What Ziegfeld Considered Ugly Became Stars in the Film Industry (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xin Ni</p>
<p>Florenz Ziegfeld, after his death, was given an honorific in the entertainment world, called "The Great Ziegfeld," and a film was made about his life and deeds, praising his entire career. Why? It was all because of his lifelong dedication to promoting beauty. All his life, he pursued perfection, etc. He was the Cellini of Broadway (Italian sculptor), except that he worked with female forms, while Cellini worked with metal.</p>
<p>Ziegfeld's revue was famous in the United States for decades, and the beautiful women who came out of it and entered the film world were countless. We can list a few famous ones, such as Lillian Tashman (deceased), Billie Dove, Dorothy Mackaill, Marion Davies, Mae Murray, etc., all of whom were promoted by the Great Ziegfeld.</p>
<p>But if Ziegfeld saw Greta Garbo, Katharine Hepburn, Janet Gaynor, Joan Crawford, Helen Hayes, Anna Sten, etc., who are now famous in the film world, would he choose them to join his revue? Everyone knows that it would be impossible. He would definitely tell his assistants, Ned Wayburn or Cholmley Gibb, to get them out quickly. As for why, he might talk to you about it when he was in a good mood, but Ziegfeld's temper was usually very volatile, and he wasn't very willing to talk about his reasons.</p>
<p>But in Ziegfeld's mind, what kind of person was Greta Garbo? He would definitely say that her mouth was facing this way, and her eyes were facing that way. He would also say that her forehead was too high and her nose was too low. He might say that her eye sockets were too deep and her upper lip drooped too much. These are the words of an artist, and that is, the words of Ziegfeld. But no matter what, Greta Garbo is a beauty with a unique charm on the screen.</p>
<p>If Katharine Hepburn went to Ziegfeld looking for a job, Ziegfeld would look at her and say, "No, no," and chase her away. If Katharine insisted on knowing why, and Ziegfeld was willing to talk to her for a minute or two, he would tell her that her cheekbones were too high, her cheekbones were too long, and her entire face looked too much like someone from the Stone Age: In short, her face was a horse face. But Katharine still retains her beauty on the screen, and her beauty is based on her flaws.</p>
<p>Ziegfeld's life's work was measuring beauty with a ruler. He established an immutable standard for perfect beauty in dimensions. For example, "The height must be five feet five inches (English), bust thirty-four inches, waist twenty-six inches, hips thirty-seven inches, calf thirteen and a half inches, shoulder circumference fifteen inches, neck to waist fifteen inches, neck length two and a half inches, arm length twenty-seven inches, etc." But...</p>
<p>We don't want to pry into the secrets of the makeup rooms of the major stars, but it is clear that very few of them meet Ziegfeld's dimensions of beauty. For example, comparing Greta Garbo to Janet Gaynor, Garbo is six inches taller than Gaynor, and Gaynor weighs twenty-six pounds less than Garbo. Neither of them meets the standard of beauty, but both of them occupy the highest position on the screen, coexisting without interfering with each other. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Movie Reviews</p>
<h3>"The Iron Hand of Compassion"</h3>
<p>— Zhao Ren</p>
<p>Father Brown, Detective — Cathay Release</p>
<p>About a month or so ago, I saw a movie, the title of which I have already forgotten. I only remember that the story was about a famous playwright who bravely saved the lives of several women when a ship was wrecked. The women he saved were naturally very grateful, but thinking that he had died, they erected a bronze statue in front of his theater to commemorate him. So, his wife, children, and family all thought he was dead and were very sad. Who knew that in the crisis, he cowardly escaped in women's clothing. Although he saved his life, he felt infinite shame. Especially because people praised him as a hero, he was even more embarrassed to go home and had to change his name and wander. More than ten years later, missing his wife, he secretly returned home, but he did not dare to meet his wife. He secretly helped his son, whom he did not know, succeed in theater. Finally, he met his wife and began to live a wandering life again.</p>
<p>This drama has a strong sense of sadness and deep human sentiment, which greatly moved me. The performance of the lead actor, Walter Connolly, was also a great success. Because of this, I paid close attention to this actor. However, I do not praise "The Iron Hand of Compassion," which he starred in this time.</p>
<p>First of all, I don't like this kind of story, which combines religion and politics, using the power of religious influence to make criminals reform and do good. Using this empty sermon as the theme of the play, in the era of scientific prosperity in the twentieth century, it is not the work of a wise man, no matter how the playwright handles the work, right? No one will ignore the playwright's intentions. He uses film art as an aid to politics, which is naturally beneficial to those in power. However, people will not ignore the behavior of thieves, which is the sin of society. People cannot point out the pathology of society from its essence, and then inspire the audience to transform society, but only painstakingly maintain the crumbling social existence, which is just hard work in vain. In fact, American criminals will not be eliminated or reduced because of religious preaching.</p>
<p>Even in terms of expression techniques, it cannot clearly convey the theme of the play and the intentions of the playwright. On the contrary, in order to exaggerate Father Brown's holiness too much, people think that he is just a fictional character in mythology and has an aura of unreality. Of course, this is not without successful performances. For example, the entire play can proceed in a tranquil atmosphere, and the solemn and solemn mood is full of the film. The scenes of individual psychological descriptions, such as when the uncle of the girl is worried about the theft, are also handled well. But overall, most of it can be said to be unsuccessful. And the performance of the lead actor, Walter Connolly, does not show his excellence.</p>
<p>However, I also feel that in this film, it is superfluous to only point out the failure in terms of technology. Because vulgar content can only have vulgar expression.</p>
<h3>A Story of Joan Crawford Before She Became Famous</h3>
<p>— Guo Cheng</p>
<p>The following is a story about Joan Crawford joining the chorus before she became famous on the screen.</p>
<p>When Joan Crawford was in high school, she was a little girl who was very good at pleasing people. Among all the students, she was also famous for her dancing skills. Whenever she thought about her future, she would think of things about singing and dancing; this was because singing and dancing gave her too much interest. One day, she suddenly made a firm decision, left school the next day, and ran to her mother in Kansas City, preparing to find a job. The main purpose of her working was to save some money so that she could participate in the singing and dancing business.</p>
<p>So, she worked as a clerk in a store. On the one hand, she saved money, and on the other hand, she used the money to buy some new clothes. Later, she heard that a theater manager in the western region was recruiting young girls to be temporary chorus performers, so she immediately ran to apply. It turned out that it was a singing and dancing performance group in Springfield. When she arrived at Springfield, she changed her pseudonym to Lucilke Le Sueur, which was her mother's name in her maiden days.</p>
<p>But this time, she only participated in this chorus group for a very short period of time. She was only employed for two weeks. The remuneration she received was only enough for her to return to Kansas City. However, these two weeks of life enhanced her interest in participating in that business.</p>
<p>Later, she felt that there seemed to be no hope in Kansas City, so she took the train to Chicago. All she brought with her were two silver dollars and a high degree of hope. She searched everywhere for a position as a member of a chorus group, but it was not easy in this foreign city. Finally, she ran to Ernie Young, because she had heard someone say that Ernie Young was a theater owner.</p>
<p>It was a strange and coincidental thing that on this day, the "Chicago Cafe" was holding a grand singing concert, and Ernie Young allowed her to join as a temporary member in this concert.</p>
<p>In the following eight weeks, she was promoted from the inconspicuous third row to the end of the first row (this refers to the arrangement of the singing group, people who sing well stand in the first row), although she still had not been formally employed at this time.</p>
<p>That night, the theater was rehearsing a new singing and dancing comedy, "Innocent Eyes." Joan Crawford was also dancing, showing a very novel style and posture. The theater owner saw this at this time and agreed to give her a formal employment position.</p>
<p>Her position was assigned to the "Ponies" group, where many young girls treated her very kindly. They helped her with makeup and taught her many new dance steps. Joan Crawford gradually developed from then on.</p>
<h3>Gong Jianong Causes Trouble and Goes to Jail</h3>
<p>Old Gong Jianong is a man of upright character. Recently, he fell in love with the village girl A Xuan. They love each other and are already like husband and wife. Unexpectedly, A Xuan joined a fashion company as a female worker and was noticed by the pattern maker Wang Nanwen, who wanted her to be a performer in the fashion show. On the one hand, Wang Nanwen pursued her desperately, making a village girl who had just set foot in society unable to stop her mind from drifting. The night before the fashion show was held, various newspapers published photos of A Xuan's enchanting dress. When Old Gong saw it, he was furious and full of resentment. He warned A Xuan at the time, telling her not to participate, but A Xuan did not listen. So, the fashion show opened the next day. When A Xuan took the stage, Jianong suddenly broke in, tearing A Xuan's fashion to shreds. The pattern maker Wang Nanwen was also injured. As a result, he had to be arrested and imprisoned. -- Naturally, the above-mentioned facts are due to a reason, and there is no evidence to verify it. It is just a plot in "Falling Flowers Season."</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3>Amateur Reporter (After Office Hours) (5)</h3>
<p>— Tong Yun</p>
<p>Sharon giggled and said, "Let them go. They'll come out when they're hungry." But Jim didn't listen; he knelt on the ground, searching. After a while, Sharon also knelt down. They both crawled under the sofa, looking for the fruit. Suddenly, the phone rang, and Sharon got up to answer it. It turned out to be Jim's call. After finishing the call, Jim told Sharon, "Tomorrow night is the opening night of the Riverside Club again. It's bound to be lively. Let's have dinner there tomorrow." Sharon looked at Jim's face with a puzzled expression and asked, "Is this an invitation or an assignment?" Jim thought for a moment and said, "It's an assignment." After a while, Mrs. Talbot brought in coffee, and they dispersed after having coffee.</p>
<p>The next evening, Jim and Sharon sat facing each other, having dinner at the Riverside Club. Jim leaned closer to Sharon and asked, "If I hadn't said it was an assignment when I asked you yesterday, but said it was an invitation, would you still have agreed to come?" Sharon pretended to be looking at the menu, but she couldn't see a single word clearly. When she heard Jim ask her a question, she looked up and replied, "I would have come, but I would have thanked you." Jim inadvertently admitted, "I'm a bit timid; I was afraid you wouldn't come, so I had to say it was an assignment."</p>
<p>Jim was usually very good at telling jokes and making people laugh, but today, he seemed to have something on his mind and felt a bit restrained. After a while, he said, "Let's go for a walk outside. If you want to write about this club, you need to know everything about it." So they stood up and walked outside to stroll on the grassy area by the river. They intentionally walked a bit apart, but every few steps, they would naturally get closer and huddle together. They felt that there was a kind of attraction between them that constantly drew them together. Jim said, "I didn't expect tonight to be so beautiful." Sharon said, "I know... I know..." She couldn't say anything else.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, they had already reached the end of the grassy area, away from the noisy area. In the dimness, they became two dark shadows, standing side by side in the hazy light. Later, the two dark shadows gradually merged into one. Jim put his arm around Sharon and whispered, "Sharon, I love you, my darling." Sharon also whispered, "Jim?" He kissed her hair, soft, smooth, and sweet-smelling. After a while, he picked up her hand and kissed it. After they had been affectionate for a while, they slowly strolled back.</p>
<p>By this time, the room was already crowded with people. Among them were Patterson and his wife, sitting together. Inevitably, Tom Pannisdale was also there. When Sharon saw them, her hand trembled slightly as she reached for a cigarette. She seemed about to say something, and she stammered. Finally, she said angrily, "You knew Tom Pannisdale was coming today, coming with Julia Patterson, so you called me here, didn't you? You don't want to be with me. You just want me to watch them so I can write a news story for you!" Jim frankly admitted, "That's right, that was my original intention. But I had forgotten all about it until you reminded me."</p>
<p>Before he could finish speaking, Sharon had already stood up and said, "Oh, I see. A news reporter looking for news doesn't need to involve love affairs. I'm sorry, I'm going back." Pannisdale had already walked over by this time. He said to Sharon, "Hello, what a coincidence, I see you again." Sharon said, "Indeed, I was just looking for you." A waiter came over and said, "There's a phone call outside for Mr. Brown." Jim had no choice but to walk away to answer the phone. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>When Building Public Housing (Continued)</h3>
<p>— Xi Hao</p>
<p>...Several points to note...</p>
<p>In the past, the problem of nighttime lighting in public housing was almost entirely kerosene lamps, which are also the most dangerous items that easily cause fires. In fact, in this city, electricity supply is cheap and convenient. If electric lights are fully installed, using these lower-wattage bulbs is about the same price as lighting kerosene lamps, and it can also reduce the risk of danger, which is the most economical. Therefore, the installation of electric lights seems to be a necessary facility in new public housing. The above are all fundamental solutions.</p>
<p>As for symptomatic fire prevention methods, that is, to prepare more emergency water pipes, and at the same time, measures should be taken to add fire extinguishers. As for the safety of doors and windows, special attention should also be paid to the design so that one can enter and exit freely in case of accidents.</p>
<p>(3) Recreation: The construction of public housing should preferably not be arranged as densely as beehives; within the scope possible, it is best to leave a part of the sunny open space. On this open space, several trees or a row of junipers can be planted. If economic conditions permit, it is possible to lay a layer of inferior lawn, which is not very expensive since the area is limited. This open space can allow civilians and their children to sit or rest at will, enjoy the sunshine, and make their lives more interesting.</p>
<p>The establishment of popular libraries is really urgent. When ordinary people are idle, due to lack of knowledge, they often indulge in bad habits such as gambling. Using the most space-saving way to set up a library, managed and guided by the more knowledgeable people in a dozen or so houses, to increase their knowledge at any time is the most wonderful way to promote popular education. The location of this kind of library can be at the center point of several houses.</p>
<p>The most economical building materials for houses are of course wood and bricks, etc., but the durability of wood is not good, so it is best to choose better wood. Thin plates can be used for the roof, and then a layer of tiles is laid on top. This construction method is indeed more economical.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points are only the most important ones; there are many other small problems, but it is up to the architects to work hard.</p>
<h3>Architectural Jargon (8)</h3>
<p>— Mei Zhenhuan</p>
<p>——Regarding use on the construction site——</p>
<p>"Road Ghost" – The title "Road Ghost" is, apart from the "Boss," almost the most honorable on the construction site. But why is it called "Ghost"? This is probably because we Chinese have always called blue-eyed foreigners "foreign devils." He is a surveyor specially dispatched by the Construction Department or Public Works Bureau of the Municipal Council. His responsibility is to bear the responsibility for the safety of the entire building, and he has the supervisory position to ensure the safety of life. He also has the power to correct the errors in the academic guidance of the architect (i.e., the "pattern ghost"). Therefore, on the construction site, the "Road Ghost" is a tiger in the eyes of everyone, from the "pattern ghost" to the foremen.</p>
<p>Hand Mixed – What does "Hand Mixed" mean? It means work done by hand. Where is it used? It seems that ordinary building houses such as two-story city houses do not require a large amount of cement mixture, and there is no need to demand an increase in the production rate of the "roller," so people's hands are used to mix it.</p>
<p>Roller (Rounding Box) – A circular iron device with thin and strong iron plates forming inclined "partitions" in the middle. In use, a scaffolding is erected on top of the roller, paved with two-inch by twelve-inch foreign pine boards. A lead sheet is installed behind the roller, leading directly to the gap left on the foreign pine board. The cement, yellow sand, and stones are proportionally mixed and gradually poured down. The roller relies on electric power to rotate, and after three or four minutes, it is poured out at the central gap in the front, and it becomes a cooked mixture. (A cooked mixture is a well-mixed mixture.)</p>
<p>Small Cart – Shaped like a wheelbarrow, specially designed to transport things like cement mixtures.</p>
<p>Crane – If the number of floors of a building is six or seven stories high, it will be very difficult to transport the cement mixture that needs to be used. Relying solely on the transfer of the floating bridge (detailed above) is considered inappropriate in terms of time. In that case, the remedy is to use six-inch square foreign pine wood to build a frame, and then use a crane to lift the cement mixture up like an elevator with electric power. This kind of cart is called a crane, and it is shaped like a small boat with upturned ends.</p>
<p>Shell – For reinforced concrete projects, the initial equipment preparation is to follow the size, length, and width shown on the drawings. After calculating the positions according to the dimensions, two-inch by twelve-inch foreign pine boards are used to create a mold, regardless of beams, columns, stair steps, and so on. Then iron is tied. Once the iron is tied neatly, the cement mixture can be poured. This mold is called the shell (Formor Centerig).</p>
<p>Tying Iron – "Tying Iron" (Steel Elector) means that in the matched shell (regardless of beams, columns, stair steps, etc.), the steel bars are tied one by one with burnt lead wires. For example, ingot iron, bent iron, additional iron, straight iron, ring iron, and floor slab iron are all categories of names in tying iron.</p>
<p>Erecting Iron – Erecting foreign pine columns or cement column shell boards is called erecting iron.</p>
<p>Top Plate – The place where objects can be placed on the lower sill of a window is called the window sill, and the protruding one above the top sill is called the top plate (Toothing).</p>
<p>Lining – "Lining" (Lining) is the term for the "side posts" on both sides of a door or window. For more elaborate houses, lining boards (CliningBoard) are installed.</p>
<p>Scaffolding – A square frame made of old materials such as six-inch square, eight-inch square, ten-inch square, twelve-inch square, etc., prepared to place heavy materials on top for work.</p>
<p>Walings – When driving ordinary sheet piles, because of the severity of the depth, to prevent the sheet piles from being squeezed by external pressure, or there is a risk of collapse, a waling (Wiling) is added in advance around the sheet pile (SheetPile), approximately twelve inches square or ten inches square foreign pine wood, etc. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Perspective and Methods of Making Artificial Stone</h3>
<p>— Chong</p>
<p>Artificial stone is also called terrazzo. It looks similar to marble from a distance. Its nature is also very hard, but not as hard as marble. Because this kind of artificial stone is made of water and stones of various colors, its texture is the same as that of cement, but with a few more polishing steps. After being rubbed on cement by a machine, it becomes very smooth and looks almost the same as marble. If it is used for floors in dance halls or large halls, it is very suitable, and it can be said to be economical and magnificent. Making this kind of floor can be said to be "once and for all," which can avoid the trouble of frequent repairs.</p>
<p>Artificial stone floors have the following excellent characteristics:</p>
<p>(1) You can choose the colors you like yourself, and they will never fade.</p>
<p>(2) Various patterns can be made.</p>
<p>(3) You can avoid the trouble of waxing.</p>
<p>(4) Its texture is harder and more beautiful than wooden floors.</p>
<p>(5) There is no need for frequent repairs or replacement. Its manufacturing method: (1) Use mountains and soil to make the bottom layer, about six inches high; (2) Mix cement, yellow sand, and stones (common stones), and then cover the mountain and soil with about three or four inches; (3) Mix cement and yellow sand, and then cover it on top, about two inches thick; (4) Cover with oil felt on the cement, and then use asphalt glue. This is to prevent underground moisture from rising; (5) Cover another layer of cement and yellow sand on top, about two inches thick; (6) Then use half-inch wide and two-tenths-inch thick copper strips, arranged vertically to form equal square shapes, or various patterns can be arranged. At the joints of the copper strips, use cement to glue them tightly; (7) Then mix cement with various colors and various colored stones (these colored stones are produced in Italy), and then carefully embed this colored cement, one by one, using whatever color you want. When all the embedding is completed, the first step of the cement worker's work is considered finished.</p>
<p>The second step is for the Shandong workers to polish the stones. They have a special machine for polishing stones. The machine has a motor and a turntable below. On this turntable, there are three stones for polishing, and the thickness of these three stones can be changed at will. When the motor is turned on, the turntable rotates, so the three stones below also rub against the ground.</p>
<p>The procedure for polishing stones takes three times in total. The first time is one week later. They use the coarsest stone for polishing and install it on the turntable. When the motor is turned on, it rubs against the ground. This time of polishing is the longest, because it is necessary to polish off the layer of unclean cement on top before you can see the colors below and the beautiful colored stones, as well as the two-tenths-inch thick golden copper strips, which are also revealed on top. At that time, grids of various colors and golden edges can already be seen, but they are not very smooth. The stones used for the second polishing are finer than the first time, and the polishing time is also shorter. Next is the third polishing, which is to replace it with a finest stone for polishing, and also sprinkle a very fine snow-white powder (the name of the powder is unknown, it is said to contain toxic substances) on the ground, and then use the machine to polish it. It is said that this powder can make the stone shine brightly and become smooth, and it can also make the colors bright and beautiful.</p>

<p>(4) Adding Copper – If 1% to 2% of copper is added to steel during refining, it can block electrical erosion and prevent rust. Chromium also has this effect. Stainless steel on the market contains this substance.</p>
<p>(5) Polishing – Because the unevenness of the surface of the steel plate can create its own positive and negative electrodes, it is easy to rust. If it is polished, this problem can be eliminated.</p>
<p>Section 3: Welding Methods</p>
<p>The connection methods for the application of steel and iron include riveting and nailing, which are common. Another welding method deserves to be briefly described here.</p>
<p>There are two types of force welding: force welding and fusion welding:</p>
<p>Force Welding – Force welding is the method of heating the two ends of an iron plate slightly to soften them and then striking them with force to make them connect.</p>
<p>Fusion Welding – Welding is the method of heating the two ends of an iron plate together to melt them and then sticking them together. When it cools, they are already merged and welded together. The heating method is divided into three categories:</p>
<p>(1) Blowpipe Method – Using a mixed gas of Acetglene and oxygen, which is blown out through a blowpipe and ignited, can obtain a high temperature of 1800 degrees Fahrenheit, which is sufficient to melt and weld steel. This method is convenient for emergency repairs and is widely used.</p>
<p>(2) Reduction Method – A mixture of iron dioxide and aluminum is heated red to 4000 degrees Fahrenheit to obtain molten iron, which can be poured onto the joint to weld it. This method is mostly used for repairing cracks.</p>
<p>(3) Electric Welding Method – Using alternating or direct current, and discharging electricity with two electrodes at a distance, can melt and weld steel. This method is mostly used in the manufacture of steel products. (End of Chapter 5)</p>
