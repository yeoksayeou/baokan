<p>時評</p>
<h3>無線電廣播改善問題</h3>
<p>— 都</p>
<p>年來上海無綫電廣播事業之發達。殆非一般人始料所能及。民營電臺之追踵設立。機件材料之大量輸入。在在有以徵市民對此新興事業需要之殷繁。吾人試一涉足街頭。到處可聞嘈切盈耳之音。而在通常住宅中。亦幾於『弦歌』之聲不絕。際此百業均吿衰落之日。而廣播一項。獨具蓬勃之象。摯此衡彼。寧非甚異。吾人於此有必須注意者。廣播事業對於市民。旣有如此良好之因緣。在其密邇接觸之下。所給予之影響。自亦非復淺尠。果不加以合理之管制與調節。則流弊所曁。要有難以使人釋然者。今且就檢討所得。一抒吾人之意見。</p>
<p>廣播電臺之功用。原在傳布消息於公衆。商家藉作宣傳。不惜致以重酬一。般經營電臺事業者。視為利藪所在。僉謀杯羹之分。於是西嗚東應。漫無限制。以有今日嘈雜不堪之現象。據調査上海一埠。私立電臺無慮三數十家。而一日二十四小時中。收音時間竟達十八小時以上。在此錯綜糾結之局面下。非唯收音方面。難期淸晰。卽論廣吿收效。亦屬甚僅。電力與金錢。實均有浪擲之虞。而消耗市民寳貴之時間。尤屬社會一筆重大之損失。以上海三百萬人口而論。每日十八小時計算。假定平均每小時有千分之一市民消磨時間於收音。則其總和寧不可驚。救濟之道。唯望主管當局以合理之手腕。為統籌之處理。對電臺之設立與播音之時間。均宜予以相當之限制。庶幾無謂之消耗可以减免。實際之效用漸入正軌。</p>
<p>其次關於播音節目之審別。亦有值得討論之處。今日各電臺所播送之娛樂節目。大都偏於低級趣味。殊乏涵義可尋。此在電臺方面。為迎合大衆心理計。原亦無足深怪。惟念此中關聯之大。影響之深切。誠不宜專為牟利着想。而忽視所造之因果。地方敎育當局。似亦應予以相當之指導與恊助。於各項節目之內涵性質。允宜多方設法使之提高。其為低級社會所表歡迎之說書等類。正不妨授以必要之訓練。藉為常識之灌輸。至若鄙俚油滑之對白。迥勝盪氣之歌唱。足以誘發靑年頹廢之觀念。遺留惡劣之印象者。自應切實加以取締。而別選高尚優美之音樂以代之。音樂足以移易人情。任何人所不能否認。要在抉擇得宜。方蘄趨向無誤。鄭衛之樂。桑濮之音。在我國歷史上早已視同戾氛。以其挾有蠱惑之成分。易於蕩佚人志也。今我國人當萎靡之餘生。思振作之不暇。詎能復以狄成滌濫之音。驅靑年入消沉之途耶。</p>

<p>（倫敦）阿比西尼亞國皇昨向星期泰晤士報訪員發表談話云、「意大利係一工業國、現方日夜工作製造新式武器、以供軍隊之用、此在阿國其人民以畜牧耕種為生、缺乏富源、未能製造軍器、不得不向外國購買槍砲、用以替代大刀長矛、但自最近數星期以來、已不能向捷克·丹麥法比等國購買軍器彈藥、有時物價雖已付淸、而所購軍火、仍在海港拘留、無法運出、其結論則謂、「英國人素以光明見稱、溯自意阿爭端發生以來、阿國對於國聯會會員國義務、有何未盡之處、能有所指出否、意阿戰事如果爆發、試問阿國曾有挑釁之舉動否、阿國理直氣壯、各文明國雖不能制北戰禍、至少亦不當妨害阿國使之無從購置自衛工具」云云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>艾登東游結果　英報見解不一　三國陣綫瀕於破裂</h3>
<p>（倫敦）此間報紙對於艾登巴黎羅馬之行、見解殊為不一、每日電聞於社論中聲稱、艾登對於內閣殊無令人滿意之報吿、英法意三國在斯特拉薩會議中之聯合陣綫、雖未全然破裂然亦未獲得全然之恢復、法意兩國對於英政府給予英德海軍恊調之解釋、顯不滿意、英法兩國之堅决要求、卽在英國對德不容單獨行動、而非互相通知解釋之表面儀式也、晨郵報對於英政府事前不能與法意商榷、擅與德國作海軍上之協調、自壤斯特拉薩會議之陣綫、大事抨擊、指為舉棋不定、自相矛盾之政策、卽艾登事後之解釋、仍未能恢復三國間之互信、故三國合作前途若何、此後似少把握矣、（二十九日國民電）</p>

<h3>張羣昨晚抵滬</h3>
<p>湖北省政府主席張羣、於昨日下午五時、乘特快車出京、業於十一時三十分抵滬、內部法官略有變更</p>
<h3>第一特區　今日實行行新法　內部法官略有變更</h3>
<p>第一特區地方法院、因四級三審制、奉令改為三級三審、並定於今日實行、而新頒刑法刑事訴訟法及民事訴訟法、亦同於今日發生效力、故該院內部、遂稍有變動、且今日復為該院與高二分院例定暑假兩月開始之期、辦公時間、略有伸縮、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>審級制度改革後、第一特區地方法院、原有之簡易庭、自七月一日起裁撤、所有民事訟案、無分簡易地方、槪歸民庭審理、惟以各補房每日起訴之刑事案件甚繁、故將刑庭別為甲乙兩組、甲組所審理者、卽以前隸屬地方庭之案、乙組則審判五年以下有期徒刑之案、</p>
<p>公訴案件、在以前當未開審前、得聲請撤回、自新法實施後、則改為辯論終結前矣、</p>
<p>自訴案件、舊法規定辯論終結前得聲請徹回自訴、新刑訴法於三百十七條、規定吿訴或請求乃論之罪、自訴人於第一審辯論終結前得撤回自訴、但本刑為七年以上之從刑者、不得撤回自訴、此則與舊法稍有異矣、</p>
<p>舊法對於簡易民刑案件之第二審、上訴機關為同院之地方庭、開審時、採合議制、今自改為三審後、無論鉅細之案、其第二審概屬高二分院、故地院之合議庭、亦於七月一日取銷矣、高二分院、於改革審制後、其所受理之第二審上訴案件、勢將增多、原有推事員額、似有不敷之象、茲由沈院長令調第一特院推事章慶瀾·査良鑑·石美瑜·三員、於七月一日起至高二分院辦公、原任高二分院推事倪徵噢·吳象祖·兩員、則派赴第一特院任事、此外第一特院之喬萬選推事、已升任第二特區地方法院首席檢察官、向英華推事亦被調往安徽、所遺兩缺、茲經部派黃大熙。周建堂。兩員來滬接替矣、</p>
<p>特區檢察官之職權、因受恊定之限制不能充分行使、在舊刑法祇可偵査一百零三條至一百八十六條規定各罪、新刑法將此類條文、移訂於一百條至一百七十二條之內、故此後第一特區之檢察官、須改為受理一百條至一百七十二條、此乃條文先後之移動、而法條規定各罪、並無更改也、</p>
<p>第一特區地方法院、關於執行案件、向派有推事三員辦理、以免積壓、自七月一日後、凡屬執行之案、聞將改派書記官承辦、僅命推事一員為監督云、</p>
<p>高二分院與第一特院、每年例以七月一日至九月底為暑假之期、本屆仍循例暑假、而暑期辦公上午則將提早於八時起、午後休息、惟遇有亟待進行之案、仍須開庭審理也、</p>

<p>袁殊又名袁學易·袁逍逸·榮鈞·等、湖北人、曾留學日本、原係共產黨、前年自首後、從事新聞事業、最近在外諭通訊社任事、因袁前在共產黨時關係甚深、雖已自首、故不能與共產黨完全絕緣、仍擔任共黨秘密工作、本年五月間、警備司令部偵查隊·會同公共租界警務處、在福煦路拿獲不明國籍之怪西人共產黨第三國際上海葛伯鳥機關主腦約瑟夫華爾敦、當時在該怪西人身上、抄出袁殊用榮鈞化名之親筆信及住址等件、捕房認袁殊與該怪西人有重大嫌疑、遂按址兩次傳袁問話、袁匿不到案、故捕房於五月下旬通知警備司令偵查隊、一併查緝、警備司令部偵查隊、於捕房通知數日後、將袁逮捕、袁於逮捕時、不承認再擔任共產黨秘密工作、嗣經核對、與該怪西人之親筆信筆蹟相符、又經同案犯汪墨清當面指證、袁始自認不諱、汪墨清亦係本案關係、前由警備司令部、會同公共租界捕房所述捕者、查怪西人共產黨一案、最初係由武昌方面破獲共產黨機關發覺秘密文件、上海方面、依此線索先拿獲陸海防、由陸海防供出怪西、由怪西人發覺袁殊又與共產黨發生關係、兼在該怪西人手下擔任反偵工作、因此案發動係在武昌、故將該怪西人及袁殊等一併解送武昌歸案訊辦云、</p>

<p>經濟專刊四川幣制之動態（續）  趙尊白　　角幣　　（一）龍角　清代各造幣廠造，分雙角單角二種。在川南和自井一帶行使，餘地沒有流通。自井榮昌以角洋作主幣，但上稅龍角十一角八仙，合大洋一元。一切交易以角幣計值。古宋慶符等縣十二角合大洋一元，大足僅縣城及西南各塲通用，東北各塲拒絕行駛。　　（二）毫洋　廣東造的，川南各縣通用，如瀘縣叙府自井內江和榮昌的吳家塲，作六折，也有作七折的。流通狀况很複雜紊亂，如江安拒用叙府的「圈二臺洋」，但在距江安六十里的南溪和距江安三十里的木頭鎮（江安縣屬），又可通用，其他川西北都不用。　　（三）雲南滿龍雙毫　接近雲南的縣邑，如叙永等地可用，每五枚易大洋一元，除此以外，各地均不用。　　（四）雲南半龍雙毫　叙永附近各縣作七五折，餘地不用。　　（五）雲南半龍一毫　叙永附近各縣每枚易銅幣七百文，餘地不用。　　（六）香港龍角　數量很少，僅在古蘭附近流通，作八五折，餘地不用。　　半元幣和雙角單角，在下川東都不能流通，角幣行使區域，僅在川南一帶，川西北已絕跡。　　紙幣　　辛亥革命的辰光，四川藩庫被散兵搶刦，到了軍政府成立，因為經濟缺乏，遂由軍政府發行一種不兌換紙幣，因為經濟缺乏，遂由軍政府發行一種不兌換紙幣，呌作「軍用票」後來發行太濫，價低大落，每元僅作二三角，民國四年才由川政府備價收回。跟著濬川源銀行成立於暑襪街，川政府指定為四川金庫，發行鈔票二百萬元，續因政局變化，該行倒閉，他發生的鈔票也停兌了。交通銀行在重慶設的分行，發行鈔票，和雲南中國銀行的兌換劵，價值同時低落至三四折，結果交通銀行撤　重慶支行，聞這次民衆受鈔票的損失，差不多近千萬元。民國十一年重慶大中銀行發生鈔票五十萬元，也受川局影響，不久停業，鈔票由該行陸續收回。民國十二年熊克武成立四川銀行和四川官銀號，發行鈔票，以供軍費，共三百六十萬元，戰時發生，這銀行銀號的鈔票，隨着政局變更而停止兌換。民國十五年，成都廠雜風潮擴大，軍人所設的錢莊，如裕通·成益·恒裕乘時發生執照，票面分千元·五百元·百元·五十元·五元·一元。那時恰逢民衆厭惡銀幣雜紊，而銀幣價值　之於一般奸商狡儈的手裏，行使困難。執照旣不分成色的高下，携帶又便，民衆願意行使，商界因交付金融界不感困難，樂於收受。但投機家利用時機，只需付出數百元的印刷費，便得幾千幾百的通貨，本小利大，於是發生執照的錢莊在成都市中，也有百餘家，民衆因銀幣成色問題，鬧得頭昏眼花，只要是執照，都願接受，毫未注意他發行錢莊之資本充實與否。過後幣制風潮平息，造幣廠專造大洋，停鑄五角幣，這些毫无資金濫發紙幣的錢莊，恐怕兌現，悄悄關門跑了。這裏我叙述一段史實：成都春熙路一家綢緞店，收進一張某錢莊的百元執照，過了幾日，店裏遣了學徒按着票面印的錢莊住地門牌號數去兌現，那知學徒走到票面所印的住地號數，恰恰是一間公共廁所。這種情形，時時發現，民衆的損失，據一般人的估計，差不多三千萬元，大半入軍人奸商的私囊。民國十二年重慶中和銀行發生偽劵的風潮，市面流通額至二百餘萬元，繼由該行以七折收回。去年廿一軍成立地方銀行發行紙幣，他的資本不到五十萬元，而紙幣發行額至三千多萬，打破四川歷來發行紙幣數量的紀錄，民衆恐怕政局變易，復蹈「軍用票」的覆轍，時時發生擠兌。因謂四川發行紙幣的銀行和錢莊，他保證準備决不遵照法律的規定，任意印行，這裏將四川發行紙幣銀行錢莊的狀况，彙錄於左：　　一、中國銀行　他是中國最老最大的銀行，在四川係採分區發行制，成都·重慶·內江·涪陵·萬縣的分支行，都發行鈔票，流通附近各縣。票面分十元·五元·一元三種，市面流面以一元五元為最多。因該行信用　著，資金最多，民衆異常信任。該行十元幣係赭色，五元的是綠色，一元是紅色，印製極精，但因係分區制，所以重慶券在榮昌可十足行使，內江發行的，在榮昌那就有作九七折，這因幣制各地不同的緣故。萬縣劵在奉節有作九五折用的。　　二、美豐銀行　該行原係美商隸屬上海美豐銀行，取得鈔票發行權。票面分十元·一元二種，流通川東南一帶，現重慶分行全係華商資本，改名重慶美豐銀行，鈔票紙質堅靱，印刷精緻，信用也好，一元幣流通各縣鄉村，十元幣多在都市行使。　　三、四川地方銀行　該行係廿一軍的機關銀行。發起人為二十一軍政務處長甘典　（今民政廳長），財務處長唐華（今鹽運使）。民國二十三年一月十二日在重慶成立。四川善後督辦劉湘即予該行發行紙幣特權。紙幣由廿一軍部財務處第一印刷所承印，印製工作欠佳，且不符紙幣規定式樣。其印發數量，未經財部准許，權純操持於廿一軍部高級長官，所以任意增印，聞發行額已至三十多萬，流通川東·南·西各縣，鈔票分十元·五元·一元·五角，全係藍色，因發行額超過資本數十倍，民衆信仰薄弱，常常發行事故。　　四、川康殖業銀行　也是廿一軍金融機關，總經理劉航琛近任財政廳長，該行現由周見三經理。民國十九年在重慶成立，發行無息存單，實鈔票的變象，分十元·五元·一元·三種，十元·五元為藍色，一元的是綠色，市面流通以五元一元較普遍，十元幣略有收回，行使川東川南川西各縣，但下川東忠縣該行劵作九折用。　　五、重慶銀行　原名重慶市民銀行去年八月改稱今名，發行鈔票，分十元·五元·一元·五角，票面色彩十元·五元·一元係赭色，五角是紅色，一角係綠色，流通川東·南川西各縣。　　六、重慶平民銀行　該行發行五角兒童禮劵，類似鈔票，係赭色，惟易損壞，收受時須看明兩端號碼字相符合否，否則不易行使。　　七、重慶廿一軍總金庫　發行糧稅契劵，分五百元·百元·十元·五元·一元·五角，流通廿一軍防區，他地拒用。　　八、川西北銀行　係廿九軍金融機關，發行五十元，二十元，十元，五元，一元，五角，二角，一角的紙幣，流通廿九軍戍區各縣，實際僅行使三台（軍部駐地）附近。市面以八折收付，二十二年十月中江已停止使用。　　九、雅屬稅捐總局　該局係屬廿四軍，發行一元，五角，二角銀劵，流通川西榮經，雅川等地，市面以九折行使。　　十、聚興誠銀行　發行十元，五元，一元，三種紙幣，數量較少，信用亦佳，流通川西彭縣崇寗和川南古宋等縣。　　十一、成益銀號　為前川軍第七師師長陳國棟氏的資本，發行廿元，十元，五元鈔票，流通成都及上川南各縣。　　此外發行執照的錢莊：在成都的還有東昇字號的十元，五元執照。康泰祥銀號十元，五元，　元的執照。惠川銀號的廿元，十元，五元執照。公濟錢莊的十元，五元的執照。新怡豐十元，五元，一元的執照。這些錢莊的資本，大半是現役軍師長的私產，發行的執照，僅流通川西各地。今年二十八軍鄧錫侯發行糧稅契券行使他戍區以內，由該軍總金庫發行。在四川各縣的小錢莊，也有發行紙幣的：如廣漢公泰字號發行二十元，十元，五元，一元，五角的鈔票。梁山利濟華森鳴裕二銀號，發行五角，一角的銀券；該縣還有六家銀號發行一角紙幣。大足縣財政科發行大足通行券分一元，五角二種。墊江有平民兒童蓄儲銀行一元券，這般字號發行的銀券，僅能流通該縣區域已內，而在西陽南溪，各行紙幣，都不行使。　　銅幣　　說到銅幣，其紊亂複雜也與銀幣相符。四川在光緒二十九年已前，市面流通的輔幣，完是制錢。二十九年後，銀幣一元可換銅幣七八百文，社會生活很低。到了民國四年成都造幣廠鑄造當五十的青銅幣，銀幣價值逐漸上漲。七八年間，因為戰事發生，銅的來源缺乏，軍餉不足，添造當一百文的銅幣，九年又添造二百文幣，那時銀幣一元可換銅幣二千三四百文。造幣廠隸屬二十八軍，收買老當五十和一百的銅幣，改鑄新一百二百文幣，重量大小和清代二十文幣相同，新一百幣僅老一百幣重要之二分之一，自然一轉手間，他們有大利可賺，但民衆因幣價日高，而實質反低，銀幣價格日增，十六年一元可換七千二百文，十七年增至九千六七百文才能換銀一元。這時各軍師旅長都收買制錢，設廠鑄造銅幣：楊森在廣安，羅澤洲在順慶，田頌堯部的旅長李煒如在南部，都造新二百幣。他們係用人力製造，製幣工作很草率，李煒如造的，甚至於幣裏含有黃泥和炭渣，一碰即碎，這種粗製濫造的銅幣，流通市塲，價格日益低落，十九年銀幣。一枚可換十五千，最近成都每元已換二十八千八百文，川北方面因銅幣質更劣，每元已換三十千了。銅賤的趨勢，真是可驚，民生愈見困難。吾人觀察四川銅幣慘落的原因，純係銅幣本身價值之低降，决不是銀貴所促成，這種現象，觀察下表，即可證明，如合川：　　銀一元換新二百文銅幣二十六千支　　銀一元換老二百文銅幣十千文　　銀一元換老一百文銅幣八千文　　銀一元換老五十文銅幣六千文　　銀一元換老二十文老十文銅幣四千文　　又如下川東各縣市塲，僅有老五十文與老一百文銅幣流通，一元至多可換十千。若行使新二百文銅幣的地方，但民衆僅作一百五十文用，一元可換十幾千，作一百文用，也不過換十千左右。但在作實用的地方，那非二十六七千不能換銀一元了。據此愈顯示銅幣本身價值之低落。形成銀貴的原因。　　四川銅幣，成都造幣廠用紅銅鑄造，重慶銅元局用青銅鑄造。因銅質之差異，防區的關係，價值遂有軒然；雖同一縣屬的鄉鎮，他價值也有高下。如大足縣新二百青銅幣城內外實用，新二百紅銅幣，每枚作百五十文，用老當二百幣作二百五十文用。但在縣西中鰲塲高陛塲一帶，二百文紅銅幣實用，二百文青銅幣作百五十文用，而老二百幣完全拒用。在縣南龍水鎮三溪塲新青紅銅二百文幣都不用，交易以老當二百幣為主。縣屬大堡萬古等塲，則通用老當二百幣，每枚作一百五十文，新二百紅銅幣值百文，或不用，青銅幣不用。就同一縣境的地方，相距不及百里，錯雜紊亂的情形，已可窺見；全用幣制狀况，我們不難推知，這裏將四川銅幣種類，　述如左：　　（一）清十文銅幣　因各造幣機關收買鎔鑄新二百文幣，川西北已絕跡，川南南溪每枚作七十文，什祁作百文，西陽實用。　　（二）清二十文銅幣　流通數量極少，川西北各縣作百文，漢源作百文，南溪作七十文，西陽實用。　　（三）川造十文銅幣　川西各縣已絕跡，資陽蘆山作一百文，漢源作五十文，梁由作二十五文。　　（四）川造二十文銅幣　流通甚少，成都作二百文，漢源作一百文，資陽作五十文。　　（五）川造五十文銅幣　民元造，流通已少，成都作二百文，印崍作一百五十文，南溪作一百四十文，梁山作一百二十五文，開江作七十五文，惟買煤可作百五十文用，奉節實用。　　（六）老一百文幣　成都造幣廠民國二年造，成都作二百文，開江作一百五十文，南溪作百四十文，馬邊作一百三十文，仁壽昆連咨陽的鄉鎮，作一百二十五文。　　（七）老二百文幣　成都造幣廠民國七年造，川北作三百文，梁山眉山作二百五十文，成都實用，開江作一百五十文，南溪興文作一百四十文，興文縣屬的七鄉建武二鎮作一百三十五文。　　（八）新幣一百文幣　成都廠重慶局造，成都重慶實用，南溪作七十文，興文叙永作五十文，但　縣作六十二文，下川東及酉秀默彭未行使。　　（九）新二百文幣　成都廠重慶局造，成都重慶實用，馬邊作一百五十文，叙永作一百文，南溪作七十文，自井及榮昌不用，下川東亦未行使。但南川屬陳家塲小河壩，又作一百六十文用。　　（十）腬銅元　係私鑄，仿成都廠造形式，鑄幣模型，係用黃泥，且以人工製造，故幣厚薄不一致，銅幣也不純，市面呼為「腬銅元」，行使困難。　　（十一）捶版二百文幣　係奸商以舊二十文銅幣加熱入模型捶成，有些原有花紋還存在，質很薄，商人常常混入廠造二百文幣裏行使。　　（十二）銅元瓣　係因市塲輔幣缺乏，找補困難，順慶一帶用老一百文幣切成二塊，每塊作五十文，四塊，每塊作二十五文。　　（十三）鉛幣　曾流通于嘉定辦為一帶分二十文，十文二種。作找補用，今已絕跡。　　四川輔幣，市塲極感缺乏，各縣商會遂有銅幣券的印行。叙永商會發行五十文二十五文銅幣券。梁山商號發行百文的銅幣券。古蘭縣商會發行五十文銅幣券，滿百即兌現。古宋商會發行五十文銅幣券，開江縣財政科發行一千銅幣券，一萬八千張，因人民拒用，由財政科收回。遂寗茶社酒店以厚紙塊作一百文用。成都造幣廠民國十五年曾鑄五十文新幣一種，較毫洋稍大，未流通。古蘭水瑙鎮有雲南二十年造，銅幣每枚值二百文，僅能行使該鎮。　　清代制錢大多為商人镕化鑠幣製器，聞或有作找補用。自　大清制錢每一文作二十文，大紅銅錢每枚作十文。興文大青銅錢每枚作五文。在梁山一元可買青銅錢一百四十兩，紅銅錢一百五十兩，有些地方一元只能換紅銅錢一百二十兩。奉節青銅錢一斤值七百文，合錢七分。而灌縣大青銅錢每枚作五十文用，川南各縣大青銅制錢每枚作二十文，清宋各私窰所造的「雞眼錢」「延環錢」則每枚作十文，至於紅銅大錢无，人肯出用，因作二十文不可能作十文又覺不值得。而仁壽縣大青錢每枚作五十文，大紅銅錢須八枚才作一百文用。　　四川幣制這樣的混亂復雜，全由軍人不尊重國家紀綱所致，民生經濟受着最大的摧殘。改進的方法，先應嚴令禁絕私造以遏亂源；再由造幣廠收買一切不合法定的劣幣，另鑄新幣。但吾人須注意四川客觀的環境，再探究民衆用幣的心理，據上文紀述民衆使用某種貨幣純視其所含銀銅成份之多寡而定其價之高低，决不以幣面定值為標準。所以雖同屬銀幣，價值逈不相同，在四川已有明顯的事實。還有發行紙幣的錢莊銀行，他發行額往往超過所有的資本和資產幾十倍，保證準備无從充實，假若不幸倒閉，這些紙幣，完全等於廢紙，過去濬川源銀行四川銀行四川官銀號和民十五幣制風潮投機的銀行錢莊發行的紙幣，已是前車之鑒，中央對於這濫發紙幣的行莊，應先查其保證準備，是否充實，否則施以嚴厲制裁，庶免民衆受着无謂的損失。至於輔幣應有統一的幣制，現在川民極感輔幣缺乏，交易不便，而奸商所造的「腬銅元」「捶版銅元」流通市塲，破壞社會經濟的組織，聞中央已有添鑄輔幣的動議，那　四川紊亂幣制，或許有統一之可能，建設四川才會有望吧！　　末了我對於貨幣問題素未研究，這裏僅歸納民衆關於改進幣制的意見，說到改進方略，還須待專家籌畫，此文不過描寫四川貨幣紊亂狀况的輪廓。二十四年四月九日寫於上海民食為何至今無辦法  端生　　民食問題，尤其是米之問題，年來漸得起人注意，真是可喜的現象。可是事實所在，自民國十九年到如今，屈指五年，其中儘鬧着「豐年大有秋」，「榖賤傷農」，「大水年」，「大旱年」，洋米（麥亦然，不過有些是借來的，）總是一樣如潮水般推進來；反而前潮未退，後潮又來，每年流出去的金錢，又何止萬萬，最近我接到友人自南洋考察回來的信，盛述各殖民地興修水利交通，及農業發展情形，雖在不景氣之時期，猶有路不拾遺之風。末了他又很感慨地說：「我們自號為黃帝華胄，相對不覺淚下」。還要勸我也到那些地方去考察一下。我想各國對於殖民地，雖同是螞蟻養蚜蟲，然而吮血吸髓，也知道難以持久，所以常施「雨露之恩」，使蚜蟲亦有生存之機會。法國之於安南，為之興灌漑排水之利，以防水旱，因之東京西貢之米，不論中國年成如何，米價如何，他總可以運來銷售。又如日本之於臺灣朝鮮，何嘗不是如法國人一樣，所以臺鮮之米養活日本人之外，尚且有餘，還運到老祖國來出賣。祇有我們興學五十餘年，變法二三十年，祇見其退，不見其進，那不是民食，件件皆然，此其故何歟？不必多說。最大的幣病，仍是能說不能行，數千年掉筆頭做文章的積習，沒有改變，坐而言不能起而行，依然如故。儘管高談計畫，條陳方案，仍無裨於農村破產，無益於民食問題。故中國人不如外國人，只在能說而不能切實去幹。假使能說能行，行又能得其　，才可稱學得他人長處，不是徒襲皮毛了。　　民食問題的理論計畫，與復興農村，同樣是現在最時髦的問題。所以不論何人，閒談之中，多少要　談到此；即是我們度文字生涯的人，拿此做題目，不論文之好壞，也最易會得到讀者的注意。惟其如此，所以關於民食一類的文字，專家學者，發揮得淋漓盡致，研究得透澈詳盡，所差者仍在一個「行」字。如其能按步去做，也不必東一計畫，西一計畫；如其不去做，計畫雖好，終是紙上談兵。　　實在是中國情形太奇特了，在去年六月以前，不是各產米之　，呼號着「榖賤傷農」麼？可是旱災發生不到兩月，他們又在大喝其「　境」老調，聲聲說糧食不足，幾乎要辦糧接濟了。難道天氣一旱，食量大增，早一兩月以為過剩有餘的米，都已消納完了，這不是絕矛盾的笑話麼？　則自去冬到今夏，雨澤稀少，大家又多在慮旱，這是應分的，今年如再有災患，真要到「民無噍類」。幸而霉雨來了，消釋了這種惶慮。接連幾天大雨，去年乾旱過甚的地方，還是戽水時秧：而有不少的地方，已在發生水災恐慌，山洪大發，江水暴漲，圩田被淹，田廬被毀等不良消息，接連而來。照怎樣情形，稍微多下幾天雨，就有地方苦水；多晴幾天，又有地方患旱；假如上天有知，亦必喟然嘆曰：難乎其為中國天了。　　為什麼到如此地步？一言以蔽之，水利不修。因之水無所洩，旱無所潴。在去年旱災旣甚的時候，受災嚴重省分，未嘗不思臨渴掘井，但是來不及了。及旱災已成，又未嘗不思興水利以工代振。我們在報上常常看到一種大計畫，某處浚某河，某處開某段，借債籌欵，結果開濬多少河道，恐不但我們沒有知道，如果今年再旱的話，所謂災區受災情形，仍是與去年一般無二，毫無辦法。但如欲稻作發達，非興修水利時灌漑排水工作完成，難以防水旱。中國近來的民食不足，原因縱多，關鍵總在生產不足。生產不足的原因，又在災多，災之中，可說無年無水旱之災，不是甲處，便是乙處，所以减輕或消滅水旱的工作，不論其為河流，為池塘，為蕩　，為井泉，都有因地制宜逐漸興修的必要。假使上下各方俱能照此做去，我知民食問題就有解决的希望。　　第二是育種，因為品種不良，大宗出產的米不是青腰白臍，糠粞稈草，即是作偽摻難，身分不齊。假使用本國秈米和洋米擺在一起，無論何人，總揀洋米買，不會買本秈，因為洋米整齊，潔白，價格又廉，相形之下，本米可說將無容身之地。前年八省市糧食會議，河北實業廳提案中，他就論到洋米和南米（即本米的　劣問題，銷路問題，他說「冀省所產大米及舶來洋米，其成色均較南米為優，當地居民食用，多年認定如此，遂成積重難返。如欲提倡改用南米，必洋米售價大漲，南米價格大落，與洋米售價懸殊，方能轉移習慣」。故如米質一好，運輸一便，那末洋米的銷路馮如不為本米奪了同來。所以要抵制洋米，還是在本身的改善，　改良稻種。　　我們做事，當然不以難而不為，但亦不能不別緩急，權輕重，而分先後，因此我以為目前解决民食問題，不在乎計劃之偉大，文章之好看，祇要切切實實揀幾件最切要最易做的先去做，等到有了成績，其他的改革興辦也容易了。在昔曹振鏞教人多磕頭，少說話，釀成清黍泄沓的積習；如今是應該少說話，多做事，才有復興的機會。我以為上面所說的兩件事，是基本工作，應該上下一心努力去做，其次便輪到運輸各項了，茲且不談。　　至於應付目前的洋米，是事實問題，敢說無妥善辦法。但是頗有人高談統制，亦有人主張限制，在我膚淺的觀察，這二者在目前，都是時機未熟。談統制，至少對於產，銷，運，儲，四者，要有相當辦法，如其做不到，說他做甚。談限制，至少對於需要他人接濟之數，有相當把握，逾額方可限制。否則漫說一句限制進口，又未免近於武斷了。在我總以為目前祇可用節制兩字。節制兩字的意義，可以說「放得出去，拉得回來」，而權操自我。也可以用「節制水陸各軍」節制兩字來比仿，就是說要他進則進，止則止，要他多少就多少。因為中國究竟還是缺米，還是勉可自給，至今還是一個謎，我不敢濫援用一種數字，作為依據。所以在食米供求情况沒有相當認識以前，在暗弄中去摸索，我們祇有用耳目之力，作行路的方針，用節制的方法，來調節米糧之出納，假使定要怎麼樣，恐怕也是徒說而不能行！　　照如此時局，食糧問題之重要，人人能知道的，可是人人不肯切實去做，所以至今無辦法。故祇有實行之責者擔起肩架去做，方有解决之希望，所謂不在多言，而在力行的了。啟事　　甘祠森·余先亮·王雨桐·魯紹柳·甘洪濤·汪警石·吳曉晨·黃影呆·段仲榕·諸君鑒，六月份稿費業已結清，請自本月六日起至十日止，每日下午二時至四時，憑本部寄上之酬金單，向本館會計處具領為荷。　　黃影呆君鑒，請將地址惠下，俾將酬金單奉上。　　經濟專刋編輯部啟商業新聞金融　洋市沉悶角幣微昂　　昨原為上半年度總結賬期、乃適值星期日、銀行例假、故咸改前一天結束、致昨日市氣、甚為沉悶、洋拆市况、早午仍開二角、與日前相同、拆票交易、早市轉賬二百十餘萬、新交易五十餘萬、午市交易二十餘萬、小總會交易八十餘萬、錢莊洋公單收解四千六百餘萬、各路匯欵五十餘萬、洋押欵交易取贖三十餘萬、客路來源三十萬、去胃二十餘萬、其餘均因銀行假期、完全在停止中、輔幣市况、較前微覺加昂、江南小洋、早市曾漲三元、開八百三十三元、午市回落二元、改為八百三十一元、結果較前日好一元、做出交易、早市六千角、午市無、廣東小洋、早市微好三角、開七百三十二元五角、午市回二角、改為七百三十二元三角、結果好一角、做出交易、早市十一萬五千角、午市四萬角、銅元為三百四十一千文、較前市亦長五百文、交易數額三萬三千四百十八千文、合代價洋九千八百元、　　早市　午市　　洋拆　二角　二角　　江南　八百三十三元　八百三十一元　　廣東　七百三十二元五角　七百三十二元三角　　拆兌　一千三百六十五角二　一千三百六十五角六　　銅元　三百四十一千文　三百四十千一文　　衣牌　三千四百十文　三千四百十文　　角坯　二百五十文　二百五十文　　貼水　九十一文　九十一文證劵　紐約股市進出甚緩　　新豐洋行報告、昨（二十九日）紐約股市、進出甚緩、漲落不一、變動極細、多數投機家咸未到塲、須過七月四日之後、再做交易、小交易所股票參差閒散、債市平靜、半日成交二十五萬股　　六月二八日　六月二九日　上落　　三十種實業股　一一八·三六　一一八·二一　跌〇·一五　　二十種鐵道股　三二·八三　三二·八九　漲〇·〇四　　二十種公用股　二二·〇八　二一·八九　跌〇·一九　　四十種債劵　九六·七三　九六·七二　跌〇·〇一　　十一種物品　五七·七一　——紗花　美棉市塲需要頗旺　　昨美棉開盤、各月漲二至四磅音、交易並不活動、市價之漲、由於缺乏拋賣、同業及空戶之需要甚暢、外國則買賣均有、利物浦與大陸帮賣出、孟買與遠東買進、天氣順利、手續稅之普遍反對、將成為秋間最高法庭之憲法問題、最後因多頭了結、發生反動、收盤平平、計現貨跌五磅音、期貨跌三至六磅音、英棉現貨漲三點、期貨漲四五點、印棉期貨商賣出七月期白羅溪、但為日商所吸收、計平果爾漲〇·五至二·七五羅比、奧姆辣漲二至三·七五羅比、白羅溪漲二·二五至三三七五羅比、原電錄左、（二十九日電）　　美棉　比上日合國幣　英棉　比上日　合國幣　　七　一一·八三　跌四　三三·一〇　現　六八七漲二　三九·四〇　　十　一一·五〇　三　三二·二〇　七　六四六　四　三七·一〇　　十二　一一·五一　四　三二·二〇　八　六三四　五　三六·五〇　　一　一一·五二　四　四二·二〇　九　六二四　五　四六·〇〇　　三　一一·五四　六　三二·三〇　十　六一五　五　三五·六〇　　五　一一·五九　四　三二·四〇　十一　六〇八　五　三五·二〇　　現　一二·一五　五　三四·一〇　　平果爾　一四二·〇〇　漲〇·五〇　一八·九〇　　十二正月　一四一·〇〇　二·七五　一八·九〇　　奧姆辣　二〇七·〇〇　二·〇〇　二七·七〇　　十二正月　一九四·〇〇　三·七五　五六·〇〇　　白羅溪　二三〇·〇〇　二·二五　三〇·八〇　　四五月期　二一五·六二五　三·三七五　二八·九〇　　又據孟買電、一日四五月期白羅溪花之開盤預測、為二百十五羅比、較上日收盤跌八分之三羅比、紗布交易所上週登賬表　　星期一　星期二　星期三　星期四　星期五　星期六　　標準棉紗反手二十支金鷄（反手二十支順手十六支反手十支代用）　　六月一六四·〇　一六三·〇　　七月一六五·〇　一六五·〇　一六三·〇　一六三·〇　一六三·〇　　八月一六七·〇　一六六·〇　一六四·〇　一六五·〇　一六五·〇交　　九月一六八·〇　一六七·〇　一六六·〇　一六五·〇　一六七·〇　　十月一六九·〇　一六八·〇　一六六·〇　一六六·〇　一六七·〇割　　十一月一六九·〇　一六八·〇　一六七·〇　一六七·〇　一六八·〇　　標準棉花（國產細絨紡二十支棉紗原料為準）　　六月三一·五　三一·〇　　七月三二·〇　三二·〇　三一·五　三一·五　三二·〇　無　　八月三一·五　三一·五　三一·〇　三一·五　三一·五　　十月三一·五　三一·五　三一·〇　三一·〇　三一·五　市　　十一月三一·五　三一·五　三一·〇　三一·〇　三一·五糧食　天雨米市清淡　　昨閘北各帮來源八九號、市上各種去胃、因天宮陰雨綿綿、客方上市無幾、致另銷淡弱、市價又短一角左右、薄稻價短角外、早稻價小二角左右、白元亦小一二角、其餘各貨亦小

<p>自由談詞話風與平話風  稜磨　　以前曾有人用話本這名稱作中早期的白話小說的總稱過，漸漸似乎平話這名稱更流行些，最近則似乎有用平話專稱短篇白話小說的趨勢。本來最早的短篇平話，現在已流傳很少，我們若想辨識其原來稱為什麼是不可能也並不必要的。如果自然的趨勢使牠們統被稱為平話，當然這就成為牠們的定名。也許有一天反是講史的長篇也稱平話，倒使人疑怪，正如傳奇之名，為南劇所佔，反使唐代傳奇特被稱為傳奇文了。　　並且繼早期短篇平話而作的短篇，實也大都屬於平話性質，宋代所流行的詩話詞話，却並無繼起。詞話這名詞，以前不大有人提起，甚至有人懷疑也是園所稱宋人詞話，是評話之訛。這一懷疑，却有點不大妥當。誠然也是園所藏而現見於京本通俗小說中的錯斬崔寗，與馮玉梅團圓，都實接近後來的平話，或竟是最早的初成形的平話。但就殘存的京本通俗小說裏也已有很顯然的是詞話形式的作品，這以輾玉觀音及西山一窟鬼兩篇為最足代表。　　這兩篇與前兩篇的不同處，在所用的揑合或提破上。評話的所以為評話，大槪就在其以故事引故事，在其中表示說話人的評論的意見。至於詞話，則是以無多大關係的詞作提破，與說話人對故事的意見無關。這種提破，在我們今日看來雖似是敷衍的部份，在當時或正是開門見由的精彩。用詞的作品大槪總是在詞極流行的時代作成的，到聽衆詞的趣味消歇，而故事本身的趣味反增加的時候，乃改成以故事引故事。由這方面，我們似正可推測宋代通俗小說各篇的時期的先後。　　詞話中的詞，在詞流行的時代，一定總是唱的。在輾玉觀音等兩篇中所引雖都只是描風景的詞，但叙述事件的詞未必就引用不到。如果可以推測會有引叙事詞的別篇，則我且可以更推測詞話是評詞與劇曲的共同祖先。這樣，詞話產生的時期怕就很早，以南宋的故事為題材的輾玉觀昔等，當已不是最初的形式而是最後的形式。　　在詞話與評話之間，可說還有一種拗相公那樣的形式。在那篇裏，旣有詞又有故事，但兩者都不很豐富。這如視為二者間的過渡形式，是相當合式的。但這篇是以篇中的諸詩為骨幹，比較該屬於詩話。唐僧取經詩話這類著作，大槪更在詞話之先，那末接近詩話的著作也可說時期較早。這樣說，則菩薩蠻一篇的中間揷詞，也當比詞全在前的作品為早了。　　雖然源流不能怎樣仔細說明，詞話的能作一種比較特殊形式的作品，似無可疑。這也比較更為代表一時代的作品。評話因後來摹倣者衆，倒使我們忽略其如何形成了。尤其因為明代擬作者的說敎氣味太深，作為引子的故事漸成為厭物，坊本的今古奇觀就都刪除了這些，我們更不覺得評話有什麼特殊處了。故人  高植　　一切都在安靜中，窗外的蟲聲也顯得很寂寞。獨自坐在桌邊，白罩裏的電燈光從頭上照了下來，我看着燈光下的灰色牆，什麼也不想，似乎要隨同這個靜夜中的世界一道安息，我的微弱的呼吸聲比窗外的蟲聲還寂寞，在寂寞的安靜中，我想打個盹。　　什麼時候我睡去了，我不知道。但彷彿很淸白，覺得是醒着，並未睡去。靜靜的屋子裏有了低低的足音在門前停止了，進到我房裏來了，他站在我桌子的對面。我驚訝他是這樣的，穿着淡黃色挺潔的西裝，頭髪梳得光光的，滿面笑容，滿身生氣，他十九歲。我歡迎地看着他，他却睥睨我，我表示很親近要同他談話，他却對我淡漠，好像不認識我了。　　我們談了幾句話，越談越遠，我們雖近在咫尺，兩顆心却隔着有一萬里遠。他突然問我一句：「你把鉀想做到什麼地步了？」我啞然答不出一偭字，是的，他在五年前把理想親乎交給了我，我先還記得我曾接受了他的理想，但後來却不大留意我所接受的理想，終於幾乎忘去了。他看找回答不出，便冷冷地，說道，「你忘記了嗎？」我認錯地回答道，「只是有的時候忘記，但有時還記得。」他發怒了，譏諷地說道，「可不要騙我啦！你欠了這筆債！」　　我說，一我想還，慢慢夾還這筆債！」他鼻子裏哼了一聲，好像連詀也不屑同我多說一句，只說了這一句，「你這一生草想還了！」就忽忽走出我的房間，我想挽留他多停一秒鐘也不行，我追他，卻追不上，他走了，永遠地走了，像他上次交付他的理想給我時一樣，一秒鐘也不能挽留就走了，難得他在五年之後回來一次，但他是走了，永遠地走了，這次走後，不會再回來了。我浸沉在沒頂的衰傷與恥辱中，覺得失去了一切。　　這時候，又有足音一直響到我的房裏。他站在我桌子的對面，穿着長袍，面色顯得憂慮過度的憔悴，但看來還是年靑。我懇切地表示了我對他的歡迎，他却顯得有點冷漢漢的淡然，我對着他的面觀看了好久，我笑着，他看着我，面色立刻由和靄變成慍然，於是他把面孔板了起來，不信任地問道，「我交給你的計劃，怎麼樣了？」我頓然想了起來，他臨走時曾經交給我一個計劃，他是不得不走的，我也不得不接受他的計劃，我應許了他，給了他保證，可是我在兩年半的光陰中把他臨走時的一切都忘記了，他的淸白，他的高遠處，還有我親自接受的他的計劃，然而我在兩年半的時間裏把什麼都忘去了，把什麼都失去了，一切都完了。　　我慚愧地想找　句卸責的話回答他，但他已經看出我的破綻，給了我一個很難看的面孔，低低地說一聲，「可惜。」　　他走了，永遠地走了，我留他，那一點用也沒有，他是永遠地走了。我受到彷彿死了般損失的感覺，我陷在無限的空虛中。　　我彷彿是睡着，但又似乎是淸醒的。我從神馳中恢復過來，我睜開疲倦的眼皮，彷彿我是在彌切之際，就要脫力，只勝下奄奄一息。灰色牆，白色電燈光，凌逼我，我像一點水，立刻化成了水氣，成了肉眼不可見的份子。　　桌上的一堆雜誌書籍和信件，覺得與我一點也無關係，我無力地站到窓邊，願隨一陣風化為氣，把我的恥辱與慚愧和我的軀殼一同化為原子，在游離世界中永遠「解散」了這個目前的我。「英國留學生」  胡考小說叢話論略（二）  寒峰　　「小說林」（一九〇七）發行最後，附「小說小話」一欄，作者署名「蠻」，實為黃摩西，其編者也。小說小話」亦最精，與「小說叢話」，可謂當時論小說之兩火傑作。而舊小說回憶一部分，尤為中國小說史之重要資料，其價值甚高。魯迅先生「小說舊聞鈔」，曾全部錄入。全篇所論小說，凡八十種，冬不經見者，各系一評。「小說小話」所涉及之範圍，極其廣擴，大概從原理到作品，糜有不備。　　「小說叢話」以理論尚，而「小說小話」則以史實考證見長。其理解，與「小說叢話」相類似。於書，除已說及的外，他詳論過「水滸傳」，「石頭記」，「儒林外史」，「紅樓夢」，「兒女英雖傳」，「西遊記」，「西游袖」，「野叟曝言」等書，稱「水滸」為社會主義作，論證尤詳。他又歡喜論小說中之人物，抒情的寫述他們，亦是「小話」一特色。　　「繡像小說」（一九零三）刋行三年，只刊過「小說原理」一文，作者為別士，即曾與嚴幾道合作「小說緣啟」者，梁啟超「亡友夏蕙卿先生「一文不在手邊，檢得一查，當知其為夏蕙卿否也。　　關於小說理論，刊於「月月小說」的前都已說到。在「新小說」上，有梁啟超「小說與羣治之關係」，楚卿「論文學上小說之位置」松岑「論寫情小說於新社會之關係」。「小說林」有摩西之「發刋詞」，覺我之「發刋緣起」，和「余之小說觀」。這些，也都是從「小設之羣治的關係」出發，指示小說之重要性，提高小說之社會地位。　　又有張某所作「小說閒話」種，載「古今文書」中，此書不在手邊，只得從缺。「小說叢話」之作，在初期的情形，大體如是，合諸論觀之，可見當時之小說的原理，批評，及其動向。自此以後，所作遂日多，成册者頗有不少，但佳者竟不多見。若「小說考證」，「小說叢考」，「小說舊聞鈔」，其價值自高，皆是輯編者，不能與此並論。（未完）冥器製紥店  唐錫如　　上星期日的上午，給孩子到街上去買一些什景餅乾，在回來的路上，看見有許多孩子和不少的成年人，在好奇地尾隨着幾個從上海來玩的外國人。這幾個許是新從外國來華的，要不然，便是永遠不踏進華界的。因為有許多使我們熟悉到放在面前都不看牠們的事物，竟着實使他們驚奇了。　　打頭的那個外國男子，彷彿是個自命「支那通」的，在手指劃脚的講給他的同伴聽。雨靴店玉器店，燈籠店，甚至油炸檜，燒餅，都是新奇的。　　他們最初停留下來的店家是一家提莊。裏面掛着五六襲不知那一個倒霉的戲班當絕的龍袍和補服。這個指導游的人着龍袍上的龍給他的同伴看，說這是以前中國皇帝穿的衣服！「這就是以前皇帝穿的衣服！」於是他們「哦」，「啊，」的驚訝了！再說到一件龍袍須繡上二三年的工夫值得幾百兩銀子的話，他們重又細看了一會，「哦」「啊」的驚嘆了。　　他們滿足了，尤其是裏面的幾個女人。　　停留下來的第二處是瓷器店。那個「支那通」又進去指着大花瓶，瓷觀音，向他的團員演說了五分鐘，可是這次，他們顯然沒有前一次那麼驚訝得熱烈了。　　於是他們又走出店來，好奇者的後面，仍舊跟着一連串的另一批好奇者。然後他們在冥器製紮店裏停了下來。　　起初他們彷彿有些驚奇；為什麼導游的人，領他們跑進這間「平庸的」雜貨店裏來，可是等到他說明這都是紙做的，是燒給死人用的時候，他們比以前更「啊」得利害了，而且還夾雜了笑聲。　　他們把噴銀鏤花的湯婆子揑了揑，眞的，留下了幾個手指印。摸了摸紅漆的皮箱，眞的，隨手低陷了下去，他們重又更痛快的笑了起來。於是更細心的翻閱檢視每樣事物。水烟筒，黃包車，鴉片烟燈，烟槍，鏡箱，女人提在手裏的手袋，熱水壺，連便桶都沒忽略的掀了蓋看一個究竟。　　他們臨走的時候，沒忘記買些輕巧靈便的念紀品回去，烟燈烟槍之類，以備回國時宣傳，他們是滿足了。　　可是冥器製紮店的老闆更滿意。不滿五角錢的貨物，他賣給他們二塊大洋。　　可惜這幾個外國人還沒看見冥器店的精心傑作—冥屋。要是他們看到中國人有這耐心，毅力，聰明與才智，在這一方面耗費他們的時間，用蘆，竹，紙，來模倣人間每一樣東西，尤其是住屋，然後再付之一炬的話，他們更將猜不透這謎之國裏的神秘的人民的！大學時代（十四）  德國施托謨苦陳隱之譯　　她回轉頭來，驚訝地望着我。「是你！」她喊，「你在這裏做甚麼？」　　「不要拿道樣兇惡的眼睛看我吧！」我說，主面去抓她的手。　　她把手摔脫了。一巴特爾那裏去了？」　　「他沒有來，是北把你推過湖來的。」　　她站了起來。「讓我下撬去！」她喊，同時眼淚從她的眼　掉了下來。　　「我不聽她的話；我祇把雪撬轉向城底方面推回去。娜麗，」我說，「我什麼事情罪了你呢？」　　但是她揑起小拳頭搥　的胸膛。一到你那些標緻小姐們面前去吧！我不願意同你們交遊；不同你。也不同你們當中無論那一個！」　　我彷彿感到一陣的情怒。我用兩乎抓住她，用力迫她坐下去。　　「安靜一點吧，娜麗，」我説，我的聲音發抖了，「不然我又要把雪撬掉轉方向，我把你一夜推到天亮，從橋底下推過去，直至那倏河流到平地的地方，我不管冰破不破！」　　這時她彷彿沒有注意我的話，她從旁面向湖上看了一眼，但她還是坐着，靜靜地讓我推走。不過我感覺得，她不久又偷偷向剛才那個方向看去。當我也向那面看時，我就看見一個溜冰人在不遠的地方向她們溜跑來，他一定看見剛才的事情，因為他顯然努力在追趕我們了。　　我已經認識了他；他就是克里斯多夫，我舊時的朋友，「拉丁人」底死對頭。我知道有什麼事情要發生了；現在就看我們當中究竟誰走得快些。　　「你推好了！」娜麗說，一面把毛皮頭布揭開，讓她的黑頭愛露出來。「他總是要趕上你的！」　　我不能夠回答；我比前更快地推動雪撬前進；但我氣喘了，推了好久以後我的力氣疲弱下來了。我聽見追趕的人愈走愈近；不停地不響地他已經追到我們脚後跟來了；接着我突然在我近旁聽見他的溜冰鞋在冰上摩擦的尖銳聲音，並且有一隻沉重的手落在我的手旁，零橇靠背上面。「分我一半吧，菲力！」他喊，一面把另一隻手抓着我的胸膛。　　我把他的手推開並推動雪橇前進，想使他從我們身邊滑邊了。但恰在這一頃刻，我被打了一個拳頭，而向外仰，後腦倒在冰上。　　我在朦朧中還聽見雪撬前行的聲音，後來我就失去知覺了。　　我在冰上躺得並不久。據克里斯多夫後來對我說，他那時走過一段路之後回頭看我，見我沒有跟上來，便轉回到我們打架地方看看。兩個人吃了一大驚，娜麗從撬上下來後，他們就把我抬到橇裏去。——對於這些事情，我祇有一種模糊的感覺，做夢一般。我祇偶然聽懂他們二人零碎片段的談話。「你還是把外套穿起來吧，娜麗！」我聽見克里斯多夫說。不，我用不着外套，我要快跑。」同時我就感覺有一件暖和的東西蓋在我身上。雪車慢慢向前移動然後又有一陣昏暗感覺襲擊了我；但我總覺得好像有一種輕微的哭聲在我旁邊走着。</p>

<p>電信特刊電界之聲電報綫路搭掛軍話後之影響  驊　　請軍事當局予以取締！　　邇來各省剿匪軍隊，往往為傳遞軍訊，在電報綫路上任意搭掛軍話。致電報通信感受嚴重之影響，雖經交部屢次交涉，各有關當局嚴令取締，然搭掛軍話之風，迄未稍戢，吾人為維護電信交通之完整，俾國家神經系統不致妨碍起見，不得不略貢數言，以為軍事當局吿。　　夫現代戰爭之决勝，有賴於情報傳遞之迅速，自為吾人所承認，吾捍國衛民之剿匪軍隊，為情勢所迫，不得已借用電報綫路傳遞軍話，亦為吾人所原諒。顧剿匪區域內所有電報綫路，大抵傳遞軍報，極為繁忙。如全為軍話所占用，則不特內外消息，完全隔絕，政情軍令，亦莫由傳達。如巴縣·貴陽綫·洪工貴陽線，以前均以搭掛軍話太多，致政軍電報阻塞無法疏通。此不特對於整個電信交通，戚受妨碍，其於剿匪軍事，當亦受若干之影響，此在通訊方面言，應請軍事當局加以注意者一也。　　復查吾國電報綫路，皆以鐵綫架設，且用大地作回路，故如接用話機，其所傳遞之音浪，大抵不甚淸晰。加之軍隊接用軍話，往往不加限制，任意搭掛，以致一條綫路上，常有接用電話十數處之多，話音干擾，極為凌亂，事實上軍隊能否利用此種電話傳遞軍訊，殊為疑問，此在技術上而言，應請軍事當局加以注意者二也？　　夫電報綫路搭掛軍話後所受之影饗，旣如上述，吾人籲請軍事當局合作者有下列三端：卽（一）非必要時，嚴令所屬，不得任意搭掛軍話，以免妨碍通報。（二）如萬一必須接用軍話時，則務請與當地電局合作，規定通話通報時間。（三）如通話頻繁，必須用專綫，則務請飭由通信隊架設臨時軍用話綫，以免佔用報線，阻碍通訊。以上三端，苟能得有關各軍事當局之贊助而實行之，則剿匪前途，實多利賴也。省辦長途電話問題  楨　　按交通部組織法，電信條例，十八年十月第三屆中執委會第二次全體會議規定行政事項之統屬案，行政院十八年一月轉奉國府令核准電話事業，統歸交通部辦理案，以及國民黨政綱對內政策第一條之規定，關於電報電話，應均歸交通部主辦，久有法律根據近年以來，各省政府，每多自設長途電話通信，甚至與國營電信競爭營業，權限紊亂，時起糾紛。自二十二年七月行政院核准「交通部委託省政府代辦長途電話原則」後，二十三年七月浙江省政府，遂與交通部訂立代辦浙江省內長途電話合同，根據此項原則，省辦長途電話問題，乃得解决途徑。　　前項原則之涵義，有三個大前提焉；（一）主權問題：交通部委託省政府代辦長途電話，與交通部委託鐵道部各鐵道車站及中國旅行社代辦電報，委託報話代辦處代辦報話，招商經理公用電話，同一意義。其主權必須屬於交通部，而不可讓與，但經濟上不妨給以百分之幾之手續費，此項手續費，即在所收之報話費內扣除，不另向收發報話人收費。可見交通部所重者在主權，在便利民衆，非與代辦者爭利也。（二）業務問題：電報電話界限，務須分明。凡用電氣由金屬導綫或用電波傳遞之書面文字，日電報。其傳遞之語言聲音，日電話。代辦長途電話處，不得在交通部設有電報局台地方兼營，通知電話，請傳電報等變相電報。反之，如交通部未設有局台地方，長途電話處自可與交通部訂定辦法代辦電報。而交通部於必要時，得惜用代辦長途電話綫，兼作傳遞電報之用。（三）營業範圍問題：省際通話，或幹綫通話，不得委辦。如省政府以前已經聯接通話者，交通部得給價收歸部辦，或由部暫時租用其綫桿，至代辦長途電話綫，須避免與部辦者，並行設置。　　三大前提，為委辦長途電話原則中之原則。査各省政府之創辦長途電話，聞其目的，無非便利交通宣達政令，亦非牟利而設。此與交通部之旨，不謀而合，故彼此應通力合作，自為政策上之必要。若各省政府不與交通部合作，單獨建設，則交通部縱不以法律立塲與省府抗爭，亦必以本身立塲，謀事業發展。而在省府方面，在法律上，縱可寬其破壞中央行政系統之名，在經濟上，則在雙方競爭營業之下，庸有何種利益之可言耶？　　外人之譏中國曰：「非現代國家，」曰「無組織國家。」惟其非現代也，故須積極建設，惟在無組織也，故須統一政權。惟組織乃能建設，惟統一乃成為現代國家。各省政府之努力建設，創辦長途電話，在現代化之精神，誠堪欽敬。惟此項建設，必須在交通部指導之下，然後能避免無組織之行動，而可收一貫之功效。否則省自為政，各不相謀，經濟人才，俱多浪費，事業價值，可想而知。為集中力量從事建設事業計，各省政府，未辦長途電話者商由交通部統一辦理，而以其經濟能力，從事他種建設事業。其已辦者與交部訂立代辦長途電話合同，彼此密切合作，免除競爭以資互助。若然則我國電信事業，必須有長足之發展矣。各省政府不乏明達之士，想不讓浙江專美於前也。國際電台最近大事記述  地　　年來國際無線電報業務進展極速，其成續實為新興國營事業中所不易多覯者。該台同人，感於社會人士愛護之般，益自奮勉，不敢稍懈，無時無刻，均在力求改進一切設施，冀以酬答社會人士之盛意，而達到國際電信完全自主之目的，故該台同人始終抱持一稱「日新日新」之精神，以進行一切也。茲將該台最近一切新事項，摘録於左，用為關心國際無綫電事業者吿：　　真茹發報台添裝發報機　國際電台總管理處及中央收發處係設於本埠金融市塲中心地帶之仁記路沙遜大廈內。其發報台則在眞茹及楓林橋兩處，雙方以遙控制方法密切聯絡。茲因該台營業發達，對外通報綫路大增，原有機件不數應用。經向美國添購二十至四十基羅瓦特短波發報機一座，中該台員工改裝工竢，並經交通部派員騐收，現已正式啟用。於是該台對於歐美雙方通報，情形益見暢利，效率格外提高。　　擴充專綫收發商報設備　該台為增進本埠各商行電報傳遞速率起見，曾於該台上海仁記路中央收發處報房內，設置電話專綫交換機，以備各大電遞打宇機或電話與該台報房直接聯絡，宛如一室，收發電報，迅速異項辦法實行以來，業經數載，商民咸稱便利。該台近因請求裝用該項專日益增多，原有專綫及機械不敷應用，特予大加擴充，以應需要。近已緒，各請求戶均已次第裝竣云。　　實行專員登門接取電報　本埠郵電機關實行合設以後，全埠郵局國祭電報，因比凡本埠華洋人士均可就附近郵局交拍國際電報，交口近該台更為發報人謀進一步之便利計，又實行專員接取電報辦法。由機器自由車並諳熟英語之高級收電人員，專往本埠華洋紳商各處收取國。嗣後凡本埠中外商行士紳如需拍發國際電報，而一時不便送交該台仁記路或愛多亞路口總分收發處或各郵局收發處者，可用電話通知該台總收電處（電話「一一一三〇號」分機「一九」或「二〇」號）。當立刻派員駕乘機器自由車飛馳前往接取，回台陸卽拍發。不論現金或記帳電報，均一律收受。如係現金電報，當塲並卽由該員核算報費，畢給收據，其情形有如顧客向各大公司用電話通知送貨。此後本埠華洋人士拍發國際電報，當益威便利矣。　　創辦國外國內無綫電話　交通部為謀國際間之電訊便利起見，特於去年令飭籌辦國內外無綫電話，該台奉令後，卽積極進行。全部機件於本年三月間由英運到，遂在眞茹電台趕工裝置。工程進行，殊為迅速，現已大致裝竣，僅一小部份尚在趕裝，預料日內卽可全部竣事。據聞已定下月間開始與各國試驗通話。至於與各國接洽通話事宜，有英美日本菲列賓等處，價目依照國際規定辦理。國內各省如欲與各國通話，均由眞茹總台接轉。其接轉價目，刻交部正在研究擬訂中。國內無綫電話，為廣州漢口上海三處。現以上三處，均已分別裝置通話機件，約下月底以前竣工，八月初旬可以正式通話，俟三處實行成績良好，再繼續擴充此項國內無綫電話通話價目，亦正由交部擬訂中。與司法公安機關商榷取締私設電台事  佑　　査私設無綫電台，秘密通信，其害甚多，舉其犖犖大者，如下：（一）破壞國營電信事業；（二）操縱金融，擾亂市面；（三）被反動份子藉以傳遞反動消息，或反動宣傳，小之妨碍治安，大之危害黨國，故交通當局歷來對於取締私台，極為嚴厲，近月以來，更在平津京滬等處刋登通吿，懸賞吿密，因而破壤者不少，均經逐一依法究辦，嗣後狡黠者徒，决不敢以身試法。吾人於此，對於各地公安當局之切實協助，與司法機關之執住不阿，敬致其感佩之忱也！　　惟有一事，須為各地公安曁司法機關吿者。卽私台之判罰，應依其機件方式之不同而分別其輕重，該項機件，大抵可分為三類：（一）收音機，祇能收聽廣播節目；（二）收報機，可聽收電報符號；（三）收發報機俱備者，除能聽收電報符號之外，兼可發報。故辦理此等案件，執法輕重，應以此以為衡。公安司法當局雖皆熱諳警例，嫺習法令，然對此電信技術，未必精研有素。故此等案件，似可依據電政機關之陳訴，分別辦理。一般而論，收音機未請登記，情節最輕，核其過失，係屬違犯電信條例第四條，須按照電信條例第二十一條下半之規定，處以五元以上二百元以下之罰金，沒收機件了案，私設電台可以聽取公家電台發出之電波及電台發出之電報符號情節較重，按諸刑法第三四零條第二項「電氣應以物論」之規定，應搆成刑法上盜竊之罪；對電信條例為違犯第三條之行為，應按該條例第二十一條上半欵之規定，處五十元以上二千元以下之罰金。公安機關，緝獲此等案件之後，應卽移送法院，按盜竊治罪，並處以罰金。電局方面，並應査明損害程度，提起民訴，追償損失，至收發報機俱備者，情節嚴重，尤應從嚴懲辦。茲將天津法院歷來辦理此等案件之判罰情形，摘錄一二於後，以供參考：　　案情　判决　　金台峙私設收報機　公訴部份，有期徒刑二年。　　私訴部份，賠償電話損失四千二百元。　　永立等銀號私設收發報機　公訴部份，各關係人分別判處有期徒刑三年以至六月，並褫奪公權不等。　　私訴部份，雙方和解，由永立銀號賠償電局洋一萬七千元。　　私設電臺之為害，旣為法律所不容，電政機關，起而嚴厲偵緝，固屬責無旁貸，公安，曁司法機關，遇事協助，亦自義不容解。深盼今後各地公安。司法。曁電政機關，仍本已往切實合作之精神，益加努力，以期私臺之澈底肅淸，非特電政之幸，抑亦國家社會之幸也！談談預付回報費辦法  仲賢　　預付回報費電報，為特種電報之一種。發報人如欲收報人拍發回電，並願代為預付回電報費者，得於發電時將回電所需報費估計若干，交付發報局卽在該電之省，冠以（回……）或（RP……）（虛點地位由電局塡入預付回電報費之數目）納費標識，（此項標識，按一字計費），收報局收到此項來電時，應卽按照該電所列預付回報費數目，塡就預付回報費憑單一紙，連同來電，送交收報人。收報人凡用此項憑單者，自填發日起三個月以內發寄回電，得將憑單內所開發報人預付回報費數目抵付報費。如回電應付之報費數目，超過憑單所列預付回報費數目時，其不敷之數，可由持用憑單之發報人補足之。反之，如除去回電應付報費外，尚有餘賸，則所餘之欵，原發報人得在憑單塡發之日起六個月內，向原發報局請求退還之。換言之，憑單內所開預付回報費數目，其價值與現金無異。惟國內電報回報費餘欵不及銀元四角，或國際電報餘欵不滿二金法郎者，照章均不能退還。倘收報人收到此項憑單後，在三個月內並未便用憑單發電，可將此項憑單送交當地電局，請求轉知原發報局將預付之回報費退還發報人，或將憑單寄還發報人，由發報人逕向發報局聲請退費。　　按照國際電報規則第五十六條第二項之規定：「電報到達收報地點時，投送局應照原電內載明預付報費之數，塡一憑單，送交收報人。此項憑單，准在該單價值以內，由塡發憑單之主管機關所轄任何一局，發遞不論有無特種業務之電報一通，至任何收報地點；或由填發憑單之無綫電臺發遞無綫電報一通，至一移動電臺。」其意義，卽凡持有預付回報費憑單者，可利用此項憑單向當地電報局或無綫電臺及其分收發處，或將此項憑單携往設有交通部電報局臺地方拍發電報一通，至任何收報地點，將憑單內所列回報費數目抵付報費，固不必限於拍發回電也。此項規定，對於持有回報費憑單之人，頗為便利。　　又各商行或廠家，如有大宗應時貨物運到，或有精良出品，均可利用預付回報費辦法，發電給各地商行，向其推銷，以廣招徠。各地商行收到附有預付回報費憑單之來電後，當然樂於回電購辦。故此項預付回報費辦法，對於招徠商業之功效，亦非淺解。　　其次，發報人因請求註銷業已發出之電報，或查詢電報已否送妥，以及收報人查詢來電之發報人姓名或住址等事項，要求電局拍發納費業務公電，（此項公電，祗按六字計費）而欲對方電局回電答復者，亦可利用預付回報費辦法，向電局預繳六字之回電報費，以便對方電局，用電報答復所詢之事。所有來往電報，祇須繳付十二字之報費。較之由本人自行發電詢問，更為經濟。嗣後收發報人，如遇有上述査詢事項，均可利用預付回報費辦法，拍發納費業務公電，以資節省。可見預付回報費辦法，對於公衆確係極有利益也。試評新訂交通部市內電話營業通則  記者　　對於公衆有利之點凡七　自本年七月一日起實行　　市內電話營業章程，對於一局業務之進展，與公衆之利益，關係甚大。交通部直轄各話局，向各行自行訂有營業章程，經交部核准施行，辦法紛歧，內容簡陋，亟應妥為規定，以資劃一。惟各地經濟狀况，自不相同，各局機件設備，亦非一律，應於劃一辦法之中，仍寓地方伸縮之意。經交部先將各局現行章程，加以詳密之研究，嗣根據各局現行制度，酌量各局當地情形，並麥考歐美各國定規，規定「交通部市內電話營業通則，」於六月二十一日公布，並自今日起實行，嗣後各話局旣有最高原則，足資遵守，而各地公衆之利益，亦得依此通則，有法律上之保障。關於前者，係話局業務問題，無容多述，關於後者，係公衆利害問題，社會人士，有深切注意之必要也。茲將該項通則較之舊章程對於公衆有利之點，述其梗槪如下：　　（一）以前各局訂立營業章程，多偏重局方，而忽略用戶方面，應得之權利。例如裝機時，祗限用戶若干日內來局繳費，而局方應於繳費後若干日內將機裝就，則並無規定，此項辦法，類似單方契約。該通則內對於雙方兼籌並顧，使無偏重之弊。　　（二）各局用戶租用電話，除天津吳縣兩局規定訂立合同，以資憑證外，其餘各局，均無契約可憑。於該通則內規定「電話設備租用合約」一種，用戶裝用電話，須塡具是項合約，雙方簽字蓋章，各執一份，俾有法律上之根據。　　（三）各國大都市電話，用戶較多者，收取話費，大都採用次數制，以限制通話，而取費最為公允。否則用戶數多，而通話不限次數，極易引起過度之通話。結果局方消耗，必致加多。反之如用戶通話次數較少，仍必與通話次數較多之用戶，納同樣之月租費，却非事理之平。故該通則內除規定包月制外，並將次數制預為規定。　　（四）各局對於用戶更名或過戶，大都收費甚鉅，用戶為避免繳納該項費用，每私相授受，不赴局方按照手續辦理，遂致用戶實在名稱與號簿上所列名稱不符。通話叫號，常生錯誤，不但對於機器之使用為浪費，且易引起用戶之責難，該通則內將過戶及更名改為免費，以鼓勵用戶自動來局更名或過戶。則匿不更名之弊，可以免除。此項更名費用，交通部每年自有相當損失，然為便利公衆起見，亦所不惜也。　　（五）宅外移機，如收費較裝費為低，易致取巧，故該通則內一方面將裝費减低，一方面規定宅外移費與裝費相等，以杜流弊。　　（六）用戶私裝機件，按照電信條例第二十一條之規定，應處罰並沒收機件。惟其權屬諸法院，諸局自可請求法院依法辦理，以符法守。　　（七）收費價目，因各地情形之不同，未能劃一，仍由各屬擬具呈准交部施行，俾有伸縮之餘地。　　上項所述，均係對於公衆有利之點，至於劃定基本整業區域，以為市內電話專營之範圍，規定各種業務類別，以給予用戶各種之便利，皆為該項通則之特色也。電局報台三種稽查之任務  沈元洪　　（一）業務稽查　業務稽査，係一種外勸職員，直接隸屬於業務主任管轄之下，因其負有推廣業務，闡揚電報效能之職責，故各電報局台，對於該項人才之挑選，頗為審愼，非有高尚品學，伶俐口才，精通業務，熟識商情者，不以充任之，其主要任務為：　　甲，推廣業務　乙，核査電報延誤　丙，宣傳電報常識　丁，探刺公衆意見　戊，說明局台辦事精神　　（二）報務稽査　報務稽査，係電報局台報房內之一種設置，所以查糾報件延誤者，其職司如下：　　甲，符號紙條之校對　乙，錯誤之補救　丙，查察報件之延擱丁，糾正報件之誤拍路綫或漏轉誤轉者　　（三）報差稽查　報差稽査，不啻為一報差中之班長，大都由報差中擇其精幹老練者升任之，述其職務有四：　　甲，送報計時　乙，査察電報誤送或漏送　丙，補救無法投遞之電報　丁，率頒報差接班或下班事宜　　上述三種稽査，已為我國電政當局所採取實施，自後電報收拍，儘能迅速，且絕無錯誤發生，斯誠電報局台商業化之表現也。我對於電報局的印象  蘇麟琪　　此篇係蘇君致函本社本其現今對於電局的印象，用事實證明，寫出來心肯中想要說的話，並無一點吹牛的意味。本刊樂為發表，足以測騐一般發報人的心理。　　編者識　　最近交通當局對直轄電政機關之銳意革新，規定種種便利民眾的方法，這是很值得注意的一回事。　　在歐美先進各國，電報事業，甚為發達，市民有終年不必寫信，而用電報代書信的。觀其通街大衢，多有Don't　Writel　By　Telegraml。等年紅大標語，光采奪目，可見一班。　　而在吾國，則不然！在昔平民小百姓要打一張電報，眞是大大麻煩的事。最先一定要老遠老遠跑到電報總局，而那個電報總局竟呌人望之生異。走進一個破大厦，裏面幾盞如豆的電燈，黑暗得幾乎寫不來字。收電員大多是幾位行將就木之老先生。目患近視，耳息重聽，這就够呌糾纏不淸了。手裏捧着一隻水烟筒，還其餘事。　　現在呢，的確今非昔比。電報局已大放光明，辦事人員都是精神抖擻，個個有生氣，比之從前，大有天淵之別！更呌人感到滿意與便利的，各地郵政支局都能隨地收拍電報，而收電員大都是經騐豐富，禮貌待人，和靄可親，對答之間，在在皆足使發電人得到很好的印象。　　現在把我個人的印象說出來：記得有一次在上海霞飛路國泰戲院看完電影出來，跑到對門的敢政分局裏拍一張去廣州的電報。報費是僅僅一元錢，我交五元錢去找，那時因有朋友還在戲院門口等着，自己忘掉拿找頭就跑開了。後來我們已經走到了亞爾培路口，而那位收電報先生却急忽忽地在背後趕了來，手裏捧着四張一元的票子送回我。當時我只道謝了一聲，連那位先生的尊姓大名，也不知道。　　還有是我的親戚，司徒小姐，她是商學院的學生。也在那位先生手裏打過一張電報，偶然遺落了一條手帕，這位先生就在當天派人把那條手帕封在信封裏送還了她，使她歡喜得什麼似的。雖然一條小手帕，值不到幾毛錢。　　一般地說：政府機關不比商業機關，內中的辦事員，因有公務員的身份，大都是比較的傲慢驕橫。（當然也有例外，那是別論，）霞飛路電局的收報先生，確實值得我們奪敬的！也足見現今電局辦事人員的精神！　　書於赴粵之前晚世界電信發明家小傳  健　　十五·洛基爵士（Sir　Oliver　Lcdge)　　洛基氏為英國物理學家及無綫電發明家。生於一八五一年潘克黑地方，年八歲入新埠文法學校肄業，十四歲助父經營商業。夜攻讀於倫敦大學：得科學試騐物理學最優等之榮譽。一八七二年入倫敦大學為正式生，一八七七年獲電學博士學位，威後歷任該大學之講師及物理學副敎授。一八八一年膺利物浦大學之聘任首任物理學敎授。一八八七年為皇家學會會員，翌年得聖安覺大學之L.L.D榮譽學位，是項榮譽之授予，當以氏為第一人。一九〇〇年氏任伯明罕大學首任校長，在職垂二十年。一九〇二年授爵士位。洛氏為當代著名物理學家之一，其潛心研究電氣現象，以之貢獻於電氣學之各部份，厥功甚大。氏於無綫電之貢獻亦多，蓋氏於電磁輻射之某本原理殊多閘明也。繼復研究電綫上放電之突波振擺性實為最佳之避雷方法。他如洛氏共振瓶尤為驚人實騐之一，近世並採為測量波長之器。氏曾實騐一八八八年赫茲氏發明之電磁波論。蓋已久知其說之偉大重要矣。後又證實克勒克麥克斯威爾氏之理論。氏畢生瘁心竭力以從事研究工作，卒成當時英國之大物理學家。其曠世之偉大發明，實為馬可尼氏及其他科學家之導師。洛氏曾創製黏屑檢波器以傳遞無綫電報。並以之在數百碼之距離間作拍發信號之試騐。一八九七年氏製成調諧波長器，經註册為專利品。至一九一一年馬可尼公司採用之。氏於他種科學亦多貢獻。如關於伊太之理論及實騐，尤其著者也。氏復作液體內傳電種種饒有趣味之研究。洛氏係最初以簡易方法，試騐鹽溶液為電流分解時，測知其分子流動方向及速度者。後以研究電波及光綫在移動介質經由之路徑等，於一八九八年獲得皇家學會最榮譽之倫佛獎章（Runford　Medal）。氏善以淸晰簡明之方法，以解釋物理學工之難題及基本原理，因為世人所讚頌。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言總統兒子自食其力  宸　　二十七報載美總統的幼子約翰，於坦尼西流域建設獲得一職，今夏將前往工作，自食其力。并加以詮注云：「身為總統子而習自食其力，亦可發人深省矣」。這在我國盛行「祖宗庇蔭」，而誇耀公子哥兒的現況下，這「發人深省」的意義，是值得我們提出來談談的。　　我國在昔即有一句名言，「兒孫自有兒孫福，莫為兒孫做馬牛」，又云：「積富不如積德」。這一教言，在啟發人們訓誨子孫，宜以自恃自立為主，萬勿競競專門儲蓄「造孽錢」，反為兒孫造成無數的罪惡。同時也可使許多「祖宗有德」的公子哥兒警醒，如果憑着祖產以為生，則容易趨於豪奢淫靡，終至墮落沉淪，陷入家破人亡之境。　　話雖如此，歷來許多守財奴積資百萬以遺後代，因而造成無數「愛之實以害之」的慘劇，殆已不勝枚舉。這或許因為我國家族主義盛行的原因罷，為父者惟恐搜索之不窮，而為子者則恐豪奢之稍後。影響所及，蕩家破產者有之，身敗名裂者有之，因產涉訟，對簿公堂，甚或鬩牆殺鬥者亦有之。這種家庭的醜史慘劇起緣於其他事故者固多，然而究其根源，家產實為最主要的動力。　　「種瓜得瓜」，這種罪孽的演成，本來是咎由自取，罪有應得，我們用不着在這兒來對他們加以惋惜。不過對於這種現象所養成的社會惡習，却不能不給以嚴厲的指責。（一）一般想澤被兒孫的父母，既然用心於積資聚產以留子女，則除了養成兒女難得弱無能驕奢淫佚之外，其自身便不免於陷入一種惡性！卽一方而成為孽求不息的吸血者，一方面對社會公益更養成「拔一毛而利天下不為也」的吝嗇。（二）家擁鉅資的公子哥兒，既然不愁衣食，於是「飽暖思淫樂」，便必然揭露出遊蕩的性情。現時之朝夕混跡於電影院跳舞場大飯店等處所的「摩登」少爺，率屬此輩，其結果是社會上病態的奢靡，風靡於世。　　這兩種現象互為因果，因而造成的慘劇，差不多充滿了報紙的「黃色新聞」，雖然它的消滅是社會的根本問題，我們卻無妨以羅斯福兒子的「自食其力」來表露這些公子哥兒們的罪惡。「娜拉」  方之中　　（一）易卜生與「娜拉」　　以「問題劇（Problem　play」馳名世界文壇的亨利，易卜生，「娜拉」即是他的傑作之一。他以「我是被人生的華奢的宴會所拒絕了的客人」而發生了對當時的社會尖端的惡感，重以法國革命的餘波的震盪了他的心弦，便舉起反抗醜惡的社會之旗了。他是憤世的厭世主義者，（Pessimism　Of　Lndi　　　　　　），他雖厭惡醜惡的一面，但他不墮入隱遁主義的泥沼，而沉湎在他的思維中是確定會實現的理想，同時他是極端的個人本位主義者，「道德」和「名譽」都渲染在他的思維中這在「娜拉」中都爾茂和柯樂克便是一個明證。　　「娜拉」是一八七九年代的作品，包含着人生多面性的問題。自此劇最初在他的故國上演後，曾引起全斯干底那維亞」的婦人充滿了「娜拉」的獨立宣言，不僅如此，歐美社會馳進了資本主義行站，這問題是援救了婦女們從男子鐵腕下掙出來的助力的。不過「娜拉」雖然掙開男子的鐵腕，又跌入了美麗之宮的新牢獄，正像娜拉那「小雲雀兒」從父親的鐵籠裏又跳到了丈夫的鐵籠裏一樣，「自由職業者」這堂皇美麗的外衣裏面不知深藏着多少神秘的汚惡和悲慘啊！　　但易卜生確忠實地背頌了這一社會課的：新興的布爾階級在鼓着全力推開封建的枷鎖「向上爬」，男性要做「人」女性也要做「人」，在「娜拉」整個基構，全建築在「人」這一點上，而易氏的良心哲學，也附此發揮出來。全劇的主題，自然娜拉脫開枷鎖，非「人」的地位，而其貫穿全劇的經緯，則是「名譽」問題，而這種釀成葛藤的基因，自然是由封建社會的傳統殘存在資本主義的遺物，附上新的偶像還魂的。　　（二）「娜拉」與「出走後的娜拉」　　「娜拉」的跨進中國，正當中國劃分人類歷史的「五四」運動的漲潮，而中國的娜拉，也便出現了。然而半殖民地土生娜拉，雖然刺激起一回揭天的狂潮，但她的命運終和半殖地的經濟基構一樣註定了夭折，於是她幸運的時候，也只合做新的洩欲器，等而下之，便成了流浪墮落隊中之一員，這點，「出走後的娜拉」適成了一個對照。現代的中國「娜拉」應該出走，但出走後的娜拉又怎樣？這是值得考慮的問題。歷定規定了「娜拉」的作者易卜生不會告訴我們，但歷史規定了「出走後的娜拉」與我們只有一面之緣。　　（三）「娜拉」的演出　　從各方面看，這次演出是超出了水平綫以上的。　　首先是導演支配角色，是絞盡了心血的，趙丹的郝爾茂，藍蘋女士的「娜拉，吳湄女士的林敦夫人的個性是非常適合，全劇的吃重，自然也是這三個人。趙丹在話劇上的生命，是隨着他的歷史發展的，從始至終，他是最成功的第一個，藍蘋女士我是初次見面，她那活潑的姿態，的確像一隻「小雲雀兒」，除第一幕略嫌呆滯，發音過低，講話過快外，第三幕便發揮了劇的全力，那種內心底表現的轉變，是很煩重的，這兒也正看見了導演的手腕。吳湄女士充分體貼出劇中人的個性，可惜在前面太矜持了一點，未免破壞了劇中的空氣，照理她是不能和娜拉對比的，而她逃出家庭後受過社會無限的冷酷的待遇，適足以給娜拉一種相反的暗示，關於這，暫時不談。飾南陔的魏鶴齡，也有很好的成績，本來這個角色是不容易討好的，而魏君居然不使我們失望，這自然是他生活的體騐力強。金山誇張的太過火，吳玲女士尚盡職。　　我們從服裝，舞臺裝置，道具各項看來，便知道他們「一切都慎重地想更得更好些」不是矯誇的話。不過燈光，在最後不能適應那陰鬰的調子，這是黃色四壁的緣故，如果要用古裝，並且要適合悲劇的雰　氣，那四壁的色調應當改換的，還有，高跟鞋是不切時的。滋味　太白遺風島市之夜  拓人　　在一個春天的午後，輪船把我送進了H港的海灣。柔媚的春天底太陽，半斜地掛在那西方的天際，它的光，金黃</p>
<p>Page 26</p>
<p>色地照耀著水銀色的甲板。這時的我，踅著輕輕地腳步，走出了艙門，徘徊在那佈滿著午後的斜陽之餘暉底甲板上，有時依著欄杆邊。　　春的輕風，帶著了些微的涼意，從那天邊，經過了海面的撫摸著我的臉。散亂的頭髮隨著風在轉，我的眼晴卻炯炯地看著這南國的海灣合山邊。　　海灣的水是一片深的綠色，小火輪的屁股在飛濺著白色的銀浪，一條條地，從南到北地織成了海的無垠之銀綱。　　山邊，曲曲折折地形成了半圓的港岸線。建築物，高低不平地好假嶙峋的山峰。再高望，嫩綠色的高山，一層層的屋宇，紅色地，白色地，低落或崛起地點綴著，一直的到了山之最高頂的尖峰。　　船的機輪在慢慢地動著，尖銳。鐵板，衝斷了織佈著的銀綱，滾起了一條巨大的屈折的波紋。心，好似波紋地在綠色的海上跳躍，一直到了岸邊。　　「春的南國是柔暖秀媚的，尤其是這綠色的島市。」　　當走上了碼頭，這個感念就在心中打轉。　　汽車在轉動著機輪，疾飛地在這島市上的高路旋轉。玻璃窗外飛進了涼風，吹醒了疲倦的睡眠，在左右地瞧盼。路旁的屋子和行人，倒下去又爬起來似的在閃耀。於是到了半山上的一條馬路旁的我的友人之門口，走下了車門，伸出著瘦弱的手去敲著那綠色的門板。　　是將近晚上九點鐘了，我合朋友走出了那綠色的門。春夜的風，在路面上吹，兩張漲紅著的臉，酒後的模糊的神經，也感到掠過的風是冷的。踅著腳步，發出軋軋之聲地在柏油的路面上。熱著的心，吹著冷的風，酒氣湧上了頭，於是眼珠有點模糊了。　　走著，慢步地走在幽靜之夜的路上。　　樹葉，好似要敲醒醉漢的心扉般的有節拍連響，那聲音，在這天地穆穆地春夜，正像是悲多汶的樂曲，更加是把醉漢的心，深深地沉入在迷濛地夢境中。　　走著，抱著一顆已醉的心，在這山上的路旁慢步地走著。　　尖尖的屋頂，亮著一盞醉者疑是星星的明燈，昂偉的石柱，抱著無限的孤獨，像守門者似的在看守著那廣闊而沉靜的教堂，鐘聲宏亮地在叫鳴，這好似是在對著醉者說:　　「上帝上救人的，你們這些犯罪的人們，別永沉醉在深淵的黑海中，上帝救你喲！醒了你那醉著的心吧！」　　鐘的音，沒有悲多汶的樂曲幽幽可泣；它只是狂鳴，好似是給醒者在敲著葬鐘。上帝呀！你是騙人的。　　幽靜的路瞳到了盡頭，低下望，盡是明亮的光在眼中閃耀，綠色的海是已成了深深地黝黑，嶙峋的屋宇，玻璃窗中透出了五光十色的光芒，一切是籠罩在橘紅色的夜霧中；再也看不出了紅色地，白色地的屋宇，再也看不出那綠油油的青山。　　「都市的人們呵！你那沉醉在這島市的春天的夜裏的快樂著！你們知道，那是罪惡的海，那是魔鬼的城，快回頭吧，要不然呵！將成為活著的骷髏，魔鬼一樣可怕的惡物呀！」　　上帝是這樣的在說著了，你們那沉醉在紅色的夜霧中的人們，可嘗聽到了嗎？將不然，上帝是發怒了！　　音樂樣的聲音又從那長著濃密的樹葉裏送進了我的耳朵，呵！心是完全的沉醉了，一切都已沉醉了。鼠  仃　　為了貪圖一點幽靜與經濟的生活，我終於把家搬到離城不遠的鄉下來了。鄉間的那種清靜的環境，新鮮的空氣，和自然的景色，著實令人可愛。長久過慣了都市喧囂生活的人，一旦突然和性靜的田野接觸，心頭確實說不出的一種愉快與輕松。搬到此地不久之後，我曾作過這樣的念頭：倘是可能的話，我願終身生活在這美麗的鄉間啊！　　我的居處是一間低矮而有點兒破舊了的茅盧，四週圍繞著青蔥的樹木，當春風拂過密茂的葉子時，常常發出一種沙沙的幽怨底，聲音，仿佛一個失戀少女底歌喉似的，陣陣打擊著我的心頭。這樣，使我感到淒涼和孤寂，特別是夜裏，每每當我伏案埋頭寫作的時候。　　然而，這刹那的安樂底生活之中，使我深感不快的，那就是鼠的騷擾了。他們不管是白天或夜裏，不管人多，或人少，它們總是那麼地出現。帶著饑慌的狼狽，在我的面前奔馳，號叫，仿佛這世界屬於它們的，它們非常猖獗地跑著，東尋西找，甚至故意的將我書籍及衣服咬破。有時，它們還膽大的，惡狠狠地凝視著我。它們一點不怕我，我真惱怒，在它們的眼中不曉得當我是一種什麼東西呢！它們妨礙了我的工作，使我對於它們懷著極端厭惡之心。有時我想狠狠地打它們一下，或者設法把它們消滅了，可是它們的隊伍很多，它們一點也不會感受到威協。當我坐在椅子裏，佯作去捕捉它們或拋打它們的時候，它們祇微微地移動了下。於是回頭向我咯咯地叫著，將前足抹抹它們的嘴吧，似乎在嘲弄我的懦弱似的。倘真我去捕捉或戳殺它們的時候，它們便迅速地躲到什麼地方去了，總之，我似乎是無可奈何於它們。於是它們的行為更加猖獗了。說不定它們會跑到我的頭上來。因為現在它們已經敢跑上我的床上，溜過我的書桌。我想：倘若我不能戰勝它們，那末，這兒就沒有我站足的餘地了。於是我決心去對付它們。我買了個捕鼠機。在當初，它們因為貪食和飢餓便上了我的當。被我捕殺了不少，我滿以為從此可得計了。心中便大大的安慰起來。可是到後來，我簡直看不見一只會落在我的陷阱裏，雖然我是用了很香的很惹味的尤魚來誘惑它們。它們已經一看破了我的計劃了，於是猖獗得比以前更甚，我就決心去畜貓。我想貓是治鼠的。有了它，我就不怕鼠的騷擾了。　　是一匹老貓，初到我家時，它的威勢著實把鼠嚇退了。有一次，我看見它很很地咬斷了一只鼠的頭，我寒心，用貓去殺掉鼠，未免過於殘忍吧，但為了我的利益，我想非這樣不可，所以我祇得忍心讓它這樣幹下去再說，　　鼠很機警地感覺它們的前途了。它們看見同類的毀滅，一種慘悲的情緒掀動著它們的心中，於是它們想出求生的方法了。有一天，在深夜裏，當我正在甜睡的時候，突然被一種尖銳的慘痛的聲音所驚醒，當我把惺忪的眼睛睜開向著那發出騷動的所在時，我瞧見無數黑蔥蔥的鼠正圍咬著那只貓。而貓的頭上，身上已經染盡赤紅紅的血。顯然是陷於危險之中了。當我下床去幫助貓的時候，貓已民經翻著白眼，為我所犧牲了。　　望著它，我想：團結的力量是可怕的！偉大的，我再沒有辦法去收拾它們了。終於搬回城裏來。</p>

<h3>A Japanese Newspaper Reproduces a Directive from the Ping Military Branch; The Spokesperson of the Military Branch Claims It is a Forgery; The Name and Date are Inconsistent and Intended to Provoke Discord</h3>
<p>(Beiping) On the 22nd of this month, the Tokyo Nichinichi Shimbun and the Osaka Mainichi Shimbun of Japan both published a reproduced directive from the Military Branch, the content of which concerned the guidance of various national salvation organizations and groups by the Northeast Office of the Organization Department of the Central Party Headquarters. The reporter went to inquire about the truth, and according to the spokesperson of the Military Branch, the document was clearly forged by someone intending to provoke discord between China and Japan. The most obvious points are two: (1) The Organization Department of the Chinese Kuomintang was the name before 1931. Since the Fourth National Congress of the Kuomintang in the winter of 1931, the name of the Organization Department has been abolished. The date written on the document published by the newspaper is March 25, 1935, but the text still refers to the Organization Department of the Chinese Kuomintang. This is a contradiction. (2) The document mentions the Northeast Office of the Organization Department of the Chinese Kuomintang. The error regarding the Organization Department has been detailed in the previous section. Furthermore, there is fundamentally no organization called the Northeast Office of the Organization Department of the Chinese Kuomintang. How could a formal document misstate the name of its own agency? This is the second contradiction. Furthermore, official documents and announcements of the Branch are all affixed with the Branch's seal and signature stamp. If one wanted to forge them, anyone could imitate them anytime, anywhere. The above points are sufficient to prove that the document is a forgery beyond any doubt. The spokesperson also said that at a time when Sino-Japanese relations are gradually improving and becoming more friendly, unscrupulous elements are using various means to provoke discord and intend to incite disputes between the two countries. It is hoped that officials and civilians in both China and Japan will not mistakenly believe it to be true and create misunderstandings. (30th Dispatch from the Central News Agency)</p>

<h3>Re-examination by the Ministry of Justice: Regulations for the Operation of Courts; Wang Yongbin Discusses the Reasons for Implementing the Law on the Organization of Courts</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of Justice, considering that the Law on the Organization of Courts is scheduled to be implemented on July 1st, and that the regulations for the operation of various courts urgently need to be re-examined and standardized, has specially drafted 37 articles for the regulations on the operation of the Supreme Court and its Procuratorate, 55 articles for the regulations on the operation of High Courts and their branches, and 62 articles for the regulations on the operation of District Courts and their branches. These were submitted to the Executive Yuan and then approved by the National Government, and promulgated for implementation by Yuan order. The Ministry has now issued special orders to courts at all levels to comply. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Wang Yongbin stated on the 30th that the Law on the Organization of Three-Level, Three-Instance Courts is to be implemented on July 1st for the following reasons: (1) The organization law was promulgated by the National Government three years ago, but has not yet been implemented. The failure to implement a legally established law diminishes the dignity of the law. (2) The Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law, and Civil Procedure Law are all scheduled to take effect on July 1st and are all related to the three-level, three-instance system. Therefore, if the Law on the Organization of Courts is not implemented, supplementary transitional measures regarding the different levels of jurisdiction will be necessary, which would only cause unnecessary confusion. (3) The Law on the Organization of Courts must eventually be implemented, so rather than fearing difficulties and seeking temporary ease, it is better to make a firm decision. Therefore, it was requested and approved by the Judicial Yuan to implement the organization law in phases starting on July 1st. The first phase will be implemented in the provinces of Shandong, Anhui, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, Jiangxi, Hunan, Hubei, Henan, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Ningxia, and Chahar—a total of fifteen provinces. The newly established High Court branches due to the implementation of the new system number twenty-nine, bringing the total to fifty-nine including existing ones. There will be one hundred and seventeen newly established or reorganized District Courts, bringing the total to one hundred and seventy-eight including existing ones. Wang also stated that the Ministry of Justice will handle the following six important matters in the future: (1) Clearing all pending cases in various courts within a specified time. (2) Improving the system of concurrent judicial administration by county magistrates. (3) Improving old prisons in various counties in phases. (4) Establishing a strict system for evaluating the performance of judges. (5) Inspecting the judicial situation in various provinces. (6) Selecting judges from local courts to come to Nanjing for training. (Central News Agency dispatch, 30th)</p>

<h3>Moscow Receives Report: Japanese Troops Cross into Russian Territory Twice; Two Japanese Gunboats Sail into Russian Territorial Waters; Russian Garrison Ordered to Avoid Conflict</h3>
<p>(Moscow) This office has received a report from Khabarovsk stating that at 6:00 PM on June 23rd, forty Japanese soldiers and two officers crossed the Soviet border to a point four kilometers south of Border Guard Barracks No. 24, where the Glodkovo border guard troops are stationed. The Japanese troops penetrated 400 meters into Soviet territory, ascended Mount Dembechini, and descended into a valley. In the evening, the Japanese troops returned to Manchurian territory. According to reliable reports, the Japanese troops crossing the border belonged to the Third Battalion of the 68th Regiment of the Japanese Infantry. At 7:00 AM on June 26th, a large contingent of Japanese troops again crossed into Russian territory in a combat-ready state to the same mountain. At 12:45 PM on the same day, Japanese soldiers gathered at the border and joined sixty cavalrymen who were originally at the foot of the small mountain outside the border. At 1:00 PM, all the Japanese troops retreated into Manchurian territory. Later, the soldiers in Russian territory belonged to the same regiment. The two border crossings by Japanese troops were witnessed by Soviet border guards stationed in the area, but because they were ordered by their superiors to do their utmost to avoid border conflict, they did not open fire on the Japanese troops crossing the border. (TASS dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) According to a report from Blagoveshchensk, on June 27th, two Japanese gunboats, the "Morito" and "Yangming" (transliteration), approached the Boyerkovo Strait of the Heilongjiang River near the village of Boyerkovo. The strait is an internal river of the Soviet Union, and foreign ships are not allowed to navigate it. At the exit of the strait, the Japanese ships encountered a speedboat of the Soviet border guards. The speedboat immediately signaled to prohibit entry into the strait. The Japanese ships ignored the signal and did not respond, sailing into the strait. As the Japanese ships passed the Soviet speedboat, Japanese crew members stood beside the machine guns, aiming at the Soviet speedboat. In order to avoid armed conflict with the Japanese gunboats, they did not open fire on the Japanese ships, which were clearly trying to provoke a conflict. The commander of Khabarovsk has reported this matter to Moscow and is awaiting a decision from the government. (TASS dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Japan Actively Prepares for War; Aviation Industry Advances Rapidly; Four Major Private Factories Rush to Build Aircraft; Workers Increase from Four Thousand to Ten Thousand</h3>
<p>Hua Lian News Agency, Tokyo: Since the September 18th Incident, Japan's military industry has advanced very rapidly, with the aviation industry making the fastest progress. The army has its own large aircraft factories, and military aircraft are mostly manufactured in these factories. Because the need for aircraft has been great in recent years, the private aviation industry has also developed considerably. Reports on factories operated by the military have not been made public, but the achievements of the four major private factories are sufficient for us to use as materials for inference. In 1931, the year of the Manchurian Incident, the Army Aviation Headquarters ordered a total of 12,433,342 yuan worth of aircraft from the four major companies. By 1933, this had exceeded 35,364,491 yuan—a nearly threefold increase. Aircraft ordered by the Navy are naturally not included here. The number of workers in the four major companies was only 4,481 in 1931, but by 1933 it had increased to 10,128, an increase of nearly two and a half times. Capital has also increased greatly. In 1931, the total capital was 87 million yuan. By 1933, it had increased to 100 million yuan. There are also thirteen part manufacturing companies, which are not mentioned here.</p>
<h3>Next Year's Budget: Japan's Military Spending Swells; Army Minister Indicates Determination to See Requests Through</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) The Ministry of the Army has decided to hold a meeting of its top officials in early July to determine its attitude towards next year's budget. However, the top officials, including Army Minister Hayashi, have already expressed a firm stance. According to their opinion, given the severity of the domestic and international situation, in addition to the established expenses in next year's budget, new budget requests must also be strongly insisted upon and recognized by the financial authorities, and the initial intention must be carried out to obtain a military budget of no less than 600 million yuan. Although this is contrary to the budgetary guidelines of the financial authorities, necessary military expenditures must not be reduced, and expenditures that can indirectly relieve rural areas should not be reduced from the standpoint of a broad definition of national defense.</p>
<h3>Lu Zhengxiang Ordained as Priest; Ceremony Held at the Church of Saint Andrew in Belgium; Thousands Attended</h3>
<p>Brussels: Lu Zhengxiang was ordained as a Catholic priest today at the Church of Saint Andrew near Bruges. The church was decorated with the flags of the Vatican and Belgium. No fewer than several thousand people from all over attended the ceremony. Guo Taiqi, the Chinese Ambassador to the United Kingdom, Yan Huiqing, the Chinese Ambassador to Russia, and the Chinese ministers to France, the Netherlands, and Spain also went to offer their congratulations. The ceremony was presided over by Bishop Gues, a former resident in China. The Pope also sent a congratulatory message to Lu. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<p>After the ceremony, Lu sent a telegram to China stating that his first report would be to pray to God to bless China. (The end)</p>
<p>Brugge, Belgium: Lu Zhengxiang, former Prime Minister of China, was ordained as a priest with the holy name Peter Celestine today at the ancient Abbey of Saint Andrew near this city by Bishop Costantini, the former papal representative to China. Belgian officials, foreign representatives, and Ling Qihan, the Chinese chargé d'affaires, all came to observe the ceremony. The proceedings were extremely solemn. After the ceremony, guests dined together in the abbey's refectory, following the customs of the Benedictine monks. During the meal, Bishop Costantini raised his glass and wished for the development of the Catholic Church in China. The Chinese chargé d'affaires Ling Qihan rose to respond, saying that the Chinese government is willing to work to ensure that the Catholic Church can fully develop. Finally, Father Lu Zhengxiang expressed his thanks. Lu, after losing his spouse in 1927, was overcome with grief and entered the Abbey of Saint Andrew on October 4 of that year with a solemn ceremony to become a Benedictine monk. The Belgian government and diplomatic authorities from various countries all came to observe. Lu had always greatly admired the character of the late King Albert I of Belgium. Before entering the monastery, he had informed the King of his intention to enter a life of contemplation, and the King expressed his sympathy. (Dispatch of the 29th)</p>
<h3>British Peace Conference Discusses Far East Issues; Peng En Praises Chinese Culture</h3>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Problem of Improving Radio Broadcasting</h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The development of radio broadcasting in Shanghai in recent years has likely exceeded the expectations of most people. The establishment of private radio stations in rapid succession and the massive import of equipment and materials all demonstrate the strong demand of the citizens for this emerging industry. If one ventures onto the streets, one can hear incessant sounds everywhere, and in ordinary homes, the sound of "music" is almost continuous. At a time when all industries are declining, broadcasting alone has a thriving appearance. Comparing the two, is it not very strange? Here, we must pay attention to the fact that the broadcasting industry has such a good relationship with the citizens, and the impact it has under its close contact is naturally not insignificant. If it is not subject to reasonable regulation and adjustment, the drawbacks that will result will be difficult for people to ignore. Now, based on what we have examined, we will express our opinions.</p>
<p>The original function of radio stations is to broadcast news to the public. Merchants use them for advertising, and are willing to pay heavily for it. Those who operate radio stations generally regard it as a source of profit, and everyone tries to get a share. As a result, there is a chaotic and unrestricted situation. According to a survey, there are no fewer than thirty private radio stations in Shanghai, and the airtime is more than eighteen hours a day. In this complex and intertwined situation, it is difficult to achieve clarity in reception. Even in terms of advertising effectiveness, it is very limited. Electricity and money are both being wasted, and the waste of citizens' precious time is a major loss to society. Considering the population of Shanghai of three million, and calculating eighteen hours a day, if on average one in a thousand citizens spends time listening to the radio, the total is astounding. The way to remedy this is to hope that the authorities in charge will use reasonable means to handle the situation in a unified manner. The establishment of radio stations and the broadcasting time should be subject to appropriate restrictions, so that unnecessary waste can be reduced and practical effectiveness can gradually get on the right track.</p>
<p>Secondly, the review of broadcasting programs is also worth discussing. Today, the entertainment programs broadcast by various radio stations are mostly of low taste and lack meaning. This is because the radio stations are trying to cater to the public's psychology, which is not surprising. However, considering the magnitude and depth of this connection, it is really not appropriate to focus solely on profit and ignore the consequences. Local education authorities should also provide appropriate guidance and assistance. The content and nature of various programs should be improved in various ways. For storytelling and the like, which are welcomed by the lower classes of society, it is perfectly possible to provide them with the necessary training to instill common sense. As for vulgar and glib dialogues and songs that are far superior to inspiring songs, which are enough to induce young people to have decadent ideas and leave a bad impression, they should be strictly banned and replaced with noble and beautiful music. Music can change people's feelings, which no one can deny. The key is to choose appropriately in order to ensure that the trend is correct. The music of Zheng and Wei and the sounds of Sang and Pu were long regarded as evil influences in our country's history because they contained elements of seduction and easily distracted people. Today, when the Chinese people are struggling to revive themselves after a period of decline, how can we use degenerate sounds to drive young people into depression?</p>
<h3>US Navy Department Adds Military Aircraft; Sixty Aircraft with Secret Mechanisms</h3>
<p>(Washington) The Navy Department has recently signed a contract to order sixty reconnaissance aircraft at a price of $8,500,000. These aircraft are of the latest type, and their mechanisms are unsurpassed in the world. Their mechanisms are strictly kept secret. The general public calls them "mystery aircraft." What is known is that the wingspan is 31.5 meters, the fuselage is 19 meters long, and the height is 5.18 meters. They can carry five people and can be easily converted into bombers. Compared with the bombers that flew in formation from San Francisco to Honolulu, Hawaii, in January of last year, their speed is even higher (the distance between the two places is 3,500 kilometers, and with 24 hours, the average speed is 146 kilometers per hour). The Navy's reconnaissance aircraft played an important role in the recent large-scale exercises in the Pacific. The Navy Department now attaches great importance to them. (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>Britain at a Loss on the East African Issue; Partitioning the Weak Is Not What Italy Desires; Improper Measures Will Only Accelerate the Collapse of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(London) Britain's current problem is that if it does not tacitly approve of Italy's war against Abyssinia, it will be admitting the collapse of the League of Nations. Therefore, officials here are very pessimistic about the situation, and the general public expects that if Britain supports the League of Nations, it may block the Suez Canal, forcing Italy to go around the Cape of Good Hope to transport military supplies to East Africa. According to reliable sources here, the great powers are eager to partition Abyssinia, with part of it becoming an Italian protectorate, or dividing Abyssinia into several spheres of influence. However, Italy is unwilling to accept any conditions for a peaceful solution. At present, Britain is still opposed to any military action and supports upholding the power of the League of Nations. (National dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Italy's Oppression Is Too Great; Abyssinia Does Not Rule Out War; 800,000 to 900,000 Can Be Mobilized Within a Month</h3>
<p>(Paris) Our correspondent stationed in the capital of Abyssinia recently met with the Abyssinian Emperor and Minister of the Army, Mulugeta. The Army Minister stated that Abyssinia currently has an army of 350,000 men and can mobilize 800,000 to 900,000 within 15 to 30 days without feeling any difficulty. Our country's army has been brave and good at fighting for a long time and can be compared to fierce lions. Once something happens, they will surely fight bravely to kill the enemy. Moreover, they have received tactical training and are equipped with new weapons. Even if only one person and one gun remain, they will persevere to the end. The Abyssinian Emperor protested against Italy's attempt to exclude Abyssinia from the League of Nations and said that Abyssinia's reform efforts have been hindered by Italy. For example, preventing Abyssinia from hiring foreign professional consultants or borrowing foreign debts has hindered Abyssinia's construction plans. (Havas dispatch, 30th)</p>
<h3>Difficulty Transporting Weapons to Abyssinia</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Abyssinian government decided today to protest to the Belgian government against the ban on transporting a ship of weapons that had already been paid for. Similar difficulties have been found in the Czech Republic, Denmark, and France. Therefore, officials here are very resentful of the criticism of this attitude of European countries, because these countries, while expressing that the dispute between Abyssinia and Italy has its reasons, are at the same time allowing Italy to transport weapons to East Africa. (National dispatch, 30th)</p>
<p>(London) The Emperor of Abyssinia yesterday gave an interview to a reporter from the Sunday Times, saying, "Italy is an industrial country, and is now working day and night to manufacture new weapons for its army. In Abyssinia, where people live by animal husbandry and farming, there is a lack of resources and they cannot manufacture weapons. They have no choice but to buy guns and cannons from foreign countries to replace swords and spears. However, in recent weeks, they have been unable to buy weapons and ammunition from countries such as the Czech Republic, Denmark, and Belgium. Sometimes, even if the price has been paid, the purchased weapons are still detained in the ports and cannot be shipped out." He concluded, "The British have always been known for their fairness. Since the outbreak of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, can anyone point out any way in which Abyssinia has failed to fulfill its obligations as a member of the League of Nations? If the Italo-Abyssinian war breaks out, has Abyssinia taken any provocative actions? Abyssinia is justified, and although civilized countries cannot prevent war, they should at least not prevent Abyssinia from purchasing self-defense tools." (Havas dispatch, 29th)</p>

<h3>Large-Scale Italian Military Exercises in July and August; Army and Air Force Practice Joint Tactics; King and Prime Minister to Inspect in Person</h3>

<h3>Baldwin States that British Foreign Policy Remains Unchanged; Reaffirms Respect for Locarno Treaty Obligations; Anglo-German Agreement Does Not Harm Interests of Italy and France; Regarded as a Concrete Step towards Disarmament</h3>
<p>(London) Speaking at a rally in favor of the government's nationwide movement in the town of Lytham today, Prime Minister Baldwin said that the League of Nations Covenant is the anchor of British policy. There is no need to restate our willingness to fulfill all obligations under the Locarno Treaty. Britain intends to resolutely follow the path of peace and harmony in Europe and elsewhere. The issues listed in the Anglo-French Joint Declaration of February 3 remain our agenda. The Anglo-German Naval Agreement does not deviate from the sincere cooperation between Britain, France, and Italy as determined by the Stresa Conference. The agreement is a practical step towards international arms limitation. It does not harm the interests of France and Italy. He believes that it can be regarded as the first truly effective movement towards disarmament since the Great War. Baldwin then spoke of the effectiveness of the government's steps to transform Britain, saying that unemployment is the worst enemy of the country, but in the first five months of this year, the government has increased the country's export trade by £27 million compared to two years ago. Many industries have increased their employment of workers, including the steel industry. He expects that within a few years, the British steel industry will be the leader in the world steel industry. (Reuters dispatch, 29th)</p>
<h3>The Result of Eden's Eastern Tour: Differing Views in the British Press; the Three-Nation Front on the Verge of Collapse</h3>
<p>(London) Newspapers here have widely differing views on Eden's trip to Paris and Rome. The Daily Telegraph states in its editorial that Eden's report to the Cabinet was not satisfactory. The united front of Britain, France, and Italy at the Stresa Conference, although not completely broken, has not been fully restored. France and Italy are clearly dissatisfied with the British government's explanation of the Anglo-German naval agreement. The firm demand of Britain and France is that Britain should not act alone regarding Germany, but that there should be more than just a superficial formality of mutual notification and explanation. The Morning Post severely criticizes the British government for failing to consult with France and Italy beforehand and unilaterally reaching a naval agreement with Germany, thereby damaging the Stresa Conference front. It regards this as a vacillating and self-contradictory policy. Even Eden's subsequent explanations have failed to restore mutual trust between the three nations. Therefore, the future of cooperation among the three countries seems less certain. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Two Major Rallies of the German Social Democratic Party; Goebbels' Speech: Internally, Thoroughly Purging Political Enemies; Externally, Restoring National Sovereignty; Peace Depends on Military Strength</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Today, Berlin held two rallies to celebrate the anniversary of the purge movement. One was held at the sports arena, with 18,000 participants, all veterans of the National Socialist Party movement. They carried flags, sang party songs, and Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels and German Labor Front leader Dr. Ley delivered speeches to the crowd. As his speech was about to end, Dr. Goebbels turned to the foreign press representatives and said, "Foreign newspapers, do not be too surprised. You can hear us in difficulty. You should take care of yourselves." Goebbels then went to the airfield, where 150,000 National Socialists were gathered, including Hitler's Black Shirts and Brown Shirts. In his speech, Goebbels said that Britain's conclusion of a naval agreement with Germany had proven that Germany had once again become a sovereign nation. He also said, "We do not want to threaten others, nor do we want others to threaten us. The army and the National Socialist Party will guarantee peace at home and abroad. Hitler is not only always on the right path but also provides German workers with bread at the right time." Goebbels also denounced the idea of Germany re-entering the League of Nations as a fantasy. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) This afternoon, the Berlin District National Socialist Party held a propaganda campaign in the Sports Palace, with approximately 15,000 participants. Labor Front leader Li Leber and Berlin District Party Army Stormtrooper Captain Weigoff delivered speeches in succession. Propaganda Minister Goebbels then rose to speak, responding to various criticisms and explaining the points of the National Socialist Party's program that had already been implemented. He said, "We have already unified domestic affairs, reduced unemployment from eight million to two million, and restored national sovereignty in foreign affairs. We originally wanted to improve people's lives, but in times of foreign crisis, there must be priorities, such as building an army to defend the country, which is the implementation of practical National Socialism." At 6:00 PM, 120,000 members of various organizations affiliated with the National Socialist Party held a grand rally at the "Tempelhof" airfield. The field was filled with swastika flags. Goebbels once again delivered a speech, mentioning foreign affairs and saying, "The reason we withdrew from the League of Nations was that other countries did not grant Germany equal rights. We have now obtained these equal rights, and Britain has also recognized them. This can be seen in the Anglo-German naval agreement. All countries in the world respect strength. Our country has now restored its original strength. If any country is threatened by foreign attack, domestic reforms cannot be started. We do not provoke other countries, but we also do not want other countries to provoke us." Goebbels then spoke about domestic affairs, saying that the National Socialist Party's conquest of Berlin was a "political miracle." He said, "We have taken back the best area from the hands of internationalism and international Judaism, and we have accomplished great things. The employer's treasury, National Socialism, is willing to protect, and the lives of workers and socialism should also be improved." (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today at the Tempelhof airfield here, Goebbels attacked the enemies of the National Socialist Party before more than 100,000 National Socialists. Goebbels first recounted the struggle of the National Socialist Party movement, then attacked the general bureaucracy, claiming that they could not represent the country's speech. They could only follow the policies we set, and any deviation could result in dismissal at any time. Goebbels then attacked the Jews, saying that international Jews are now trying to extend their power in Berlin, and the intellectuals here are also supporting them. However, we dare to declare that if the Jews rely on foreign forces to harm Germany, we will never allow it. Goebbels also attacked political groups with internationalist characteristics, believing that the existence of such groups is enough to endanger the life of the National Socialist Party. If we see something, we cannot turn a blind eye and deliberately condone it. Speaking of the economic situation, Goebbels said that German wages have not changed much so far, but the stability of prices is extremely necessary, and the government is now trying to improve the living standards of workers, but it is still necessary to consider the issue of raising them uniformly across the country. At this point, Goebbels vehemently criticized the actions of Catholics and warned them to quickly align themselves with the National Socialist Party movement, otherwise the government will force them to comply. Goebbels then said that only the weapons of soldiers and the hoes of our labor teams are signs of national revival, and said that in today's world of no peace, it is impossible to seek peaceful survival. The country respected by the world is a powerful country, and the reason why the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was successfully concluded lies in this. Therefore, in order for Germany's reconstruction work to proceed smoothly, it must be protected by Germany's military power at the same time. This is not to threaten others, but to avoid being threatened by others. (National Telegram, 29th)</p>
<h3>Anti-Jewish Propaganda in Berlin</h3>
<p>(Berlin) Many shops here have anti-Jewish propaganda texts posted in front of their doors, which say: "Compatriots, do you know that Jews coerce your children, seduce your wives, sisters, and fiancées, murder your parents, steal your wealth, insult your reputation, destroy your culture, poison your race, deceive you, and treat you like livestock? Do you also know that Jewish police officers put you to death through procrastination, Jewish lawyers cannot protect your rights, Jewish stores sell you rotten goods, and Jewish butcher shops are dirtier than stables? Anyone who intermarries with Jews will be required to be detained, have their property confiscated, and be exiled from Germany. Anyone who dares to commit this crime again will be required to be sentenced to death. The offspring produced by this kind of union should have their reproductive functions eliminated so as not to poison society. The Jews live by deceit and die when they encounter the truth."

<h3>Before Shang Zhen Arrives in Baoding, All Departments Complete Closing Procedures; Entire Provincial Committee Decides to Submit Resignation; Provincial Government Reorganization, All Department Heads to Be Replaced</h3>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: The Hebei Provincial Government has been in Baoding for over a month since its relocation from Tianjin. The progress of provincial affairs seems extremely slow. The reason is probably that the delay in deciding on the candidate for chairman has caused unrest and demoralization, and the stagnation of provincial affairs is inevitable. The Central Government has already clearly ordered Shang Zhen to govern Hebei, and the provincial government has a person in charge. All departments are rushing to complete the closing procedures and are awaiting Shang's takeover. Acting Chairman of Hebei Province Zhang Houwan specially went to Tianjin to visit Shang and urged him to come to the province as soon as possible. Shang decided to come to Baoding from Tianjin at the beginning of next month in order to hand over the affairs of the Tianjin Municipal Government. Zhang then rushed back to Baoding from Beiping on the evening of the 27th to prepare for the closing procedures. After returning to Baoding, Zhang convened all the department heads in the Public Security Bureau of the provincial capital to discuss everything and then convened a routine meeting of the provincial committee in the Provincial Government on the morning of the 28th to discuss the closing procedures and various unfinished provincial affairs. The original department heads, such as Finance Director Lu Muting, Construction Director Hu Yuanhui, and Education Director Zheng Daoru, met with Acting Chairman Zhang Houwan once and then began to rush to complete the closing procedures in their respective departments starting on June 28th. Zhang Houwan, Lu Muting, Zheng Daoru, Hu Yuanhui, and Secretary-General Wei Jian, who were also members of the provincial committee and department heads, decided to submit their resignations. The resignations are currently being drafted and will be telegraphed to the Central Government within days. Among them, Secretary-General Wei Jian and Finance Director Lu Muting are the most resolute in their intention to resign. It is rumored that Shang Zhen expressed in Tianjin that the provincial government will be reorganized and several members of the provincial committee will be added. However, Shang has expressed his earnest desire to retain Civil Affairs Director Zhang Houwan. Shang is scheduled to come to Baoding from Tianjin at the beginning of July to take office. The current members of the provincial committee and department heads held the 628th routine meeting of the provincial committee in the auditorium of the Provincial Government at 9:00 AM on June 28th to discuss the closing and handover procedures of the provincial government and its departments. All relocation expenses of the departments during the tenure of Yu (Xuezhong) and Zhang (Houwan) that had not been filed for record and all unfinished cases were approved retroactively. Finally, the magistrates of Wuqiao, Jiaohe, and Xingtang counties were replaced. It was resolved that Wang Zhengbo, magistrate of Wuqiao County, would be assigned to another position, and his vacancy would be filled by Liu Xingpei, magistrate of Jiaohe County. Liu Jiezhi was appointed to fill the vacancy of magistrate of Jiaohe County. Xu Puqi, magistrate of Xingtang County, was transferred to the province, and Li Pingqing was appointed to fill his vacancy. (June 28th)</p>
<h3>Yangtze River Water Level Continues to Rise; Wuhan Increases by One Zhang in a Week; Water Level Enters Critical Period</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Recently, continuous heavy rains have caused the river water to rise sharply. The water level in Wuhan has increased by one zhang in a week. It rose another eight inches on the 29th, reaching 42 feet 5 inches, getting closer to the bank. At the lower sections of the dikes, the water has already submerged the base of the dikes. The regulations of the Flood Prevention Association divide the rising water level into three periods: Urgent, Critical, and Especially Critical. Below 44 feet is the Urgent period, above 44 feet and below 48 feet is the Critical period, and above 48 feet is the Especially Critical period. The current water level is about to exceed the Urgent period and enter the Critical stage. The upstream areas are still rising, and it is difficult to predict whether danger can be avoided in the future. Chairman Chiang, concerned about the continuous rise in river water, has telegraphed the authorities of the provinces along the river from the Chengdu military headquarters, ordering them to take practical precautions and protection for the dike areas under their jurisdiction to avoid being caught unprepared and causing major disasters. He has also ordered them to report the progress of the provinces and the water level figures at any time. It is reported that the flood prevention affairs this year will be carried out in coordination by the five provinces of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, and Jiangsu, which is more thorough than before. The Yangtze River Conservancy Commission will also dispatch engineers to the provinces to inspect the dikes and water levels and supervise and guide the local flood prevention personnel in their intensive work.

<h3>Changzhou Business Tax Bureau Officers Use Violence to Collect Taxes</h3>
<p>Three officers of the Business Tax Bureau, accompanied by a petitioner policeman, went to Qingshan Town Middle Street this morning to collect the summer business tax from Gao Fuquan, the owner of the Gaoyuantai cooked noodle shop. Gao Fuquan requested permission to send the tax in the afternoon because business was slow due to continuous rainy days. Unexpectedly, the officers of the bureau spoke sternly and refused his request. One person raised his hand and grabbed Gao Fuquan's chest, while another pushed him from behind, preparing to drag him to the bureau for punishment. Gao Fuquan, who was over sixty years old, was afraid of getting into trouble with the government and refused to move forward. The officers of the bureau beat him with fists and feet, and he fainted in the street. Song Wenbin, Lu Xiangrong, and others persuaded him at the scene. Song Wenbin was slapped twice in the face by one of the officers, and the ferocity was incomprehensible. When the merchants of the town saw this situation, they were outraged and immediately convened an emergency meeting of all the merchants and people. More than 150 merchants and people attended the meeting, and the following resolutions were passed: (1) Regarding the case of the Business Tax Bureau officer illegally arresting the merchant Gao Fuquan and forcing him to pay the summer tax before the deadline, it was decided that all the merchants should petition the Chamber of Commerce to transfer the case to the county and severely punish the officer. (2) Regarding the case of Gao Fuquan fainting due to asphyxiation, it was decided that after he was resuscitated, he suffered pain from the injuries caused by the punches and kicks, which not only required money for medicine but also caused a business shutdown, and all the two loss items should be petitioned together for compensation at the stated amounts. (3) Regarding the case of the Business Tax Bureau officer using violence to collect taxes and oppressing merchants, it was decided that the authorities should be petitioned together to strictly order the police to go to businesses to collect taxes in the future. If there is a need to summon those who resist taxes after the deadline, they should cooperate with the local public security agencies to enforce the law. The atmosphere at the meeting was extremely tense. The general merchants and people all felt that the Business Tax Bureau officers' illegal coercion was not permissible by law or reason. On one hand, Zhuang Kai, the patrol officer of the North Gate Police Station in the camp, sent the offending officer and the victim to the first branch station for transfer to the general bureau for legal action. On the other hand, he prepared a document to petition the party and government organs and the county Chamber of Commerce to investigate and deal with the matter seriously.</p>

<h3>Yangzhou Two Bandit Cases Occur in Succession in Recent Days</h3>
<p>In Cao'an Temple, west of Huang Jue Bridge in the northern countryside of the county, Zhou Pengliang, a local villager, was in modest circumstances, which attracted the attention of bandits. Suddenly, on the evening of the 26th, many bandits broke into his house. Zhou was shocked when he saw them. The bandits forbade him to make a sound and extensively searched for clothes. They also kidnapped two of Zhou's nephews. It is now heard that Zhou has reported to the authorities to request the arrest of the bandits and the issuance of arrest warrants. Also, Wang Yushan, the son of Wang Mingfu, a resident of Gongde Lane in the city, went to Gaoyou to collect rent recently. Unexpectedly, he was kidnapped by bandits and went missing.

It is said that the status quo will be maintained for three months, and then they will be dismissed separately.</p>
<h3>Jiaxing Cuifeng Socks Factory Experiences Labor Unrest</h3>
<p>The Cuifeng Socks Factory in Xiangyuanbang, North Gate of Jiaxing, was established by Yin Jing, Jiang Zuoqing, and others as shareholders. Yin serves as the manager, and Jiang serves as the accountant. The scale is very large, with more than 700 sock machines. Recently, due to sluggish sales, the number of workers has gradually decreased, and the factory must delay paying wages for one month. The factory ceased operation on May 30th, but the wages for April have not been fully paid to this day. On the 29th, the female workers of the factory unanimously asked Yin and Jiang for their wages. Because there was no money to pay, the crowd became more and more agitated and refused to disperse. In the afternoon, 200 to 300 people gathered, and the noise was loud. Fearing an accident, the factory reported to the Fifth Police Station and asked them to send police to suppress the unrest, but it was ineffective. After the staff member Luan Kun of the First Branch Bureau of Public Security went to persuade them, Chang Jiang took Yin Jingshan to the bureau temporarily. Hundreds of female workers also followed one after another and tried to break into the bureau. At around 10 p.m., the female workers still had not dispersed. The bureau then invited Gu Suming, the chairman of the County Chamber of Commerce, to rush to the scene. After talking to the representatives of the female workers, he agreed to pay half of the wages on the afternoon of the 30th and raise the remaining amount. The workers dispersed at midnight, and Yin Jing was temporarily held in custody by the Public Security Bureau until the wages were paid.</p>

<h3>Zhang Qun Arrived in Shanghai Last Night</h3>
<p>Zhang Qun, Chairman of the Hubei Provincial Government, took the express train out of Beijing at 5 PM yesterday and arrived in Shanghai at 11:30 PM. Internal Judges Slightly Changed</p>
<h3>New Laws to Be Implemented in the First Special District Today; Internal Judges Slightly Changed</h3>
<p>The First Special District Court, due to the four-level, three-trial system, has been ordered to change to a three-level, three-trial system and is scheduled to implement it today. The newly promulgated Criminal Law, Criminal Procedure Law, and Civil Procedure Law will also take effect today. Therefore, the internal structure of the court has undergone some changes. Furthermore, today marks the beginning of the two-month summer vacation set by the court and the Second Branch High Court, and the office hours will be slightly adjusted. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>After the reform of the trial system, the original Summary Court of the First Special District Court will be abolished from July 1st. All civil cases, regardless of whether they are simple or local, will be heard by the Civil Court. However, because the criminal cases filed each day in each supplementary room are very numerous, the Criminal Court will be divided into two groups, A and B. Group A will hear cases that previously belonged to the local court, and Group B will hear cases punishable by imprisonment of five years or less.</p>
<p>In the past, public prosecution cases could be withdrawn before the trial began. After the implementation of the new law, they will be changed to before the conclusion of the debate.</p>
<p>The old law stipulated that private prosecution cases could be withdrawn before the conclusion of the debate. Article 317 of the new Criminal Procedure Law stipulates that in the case of crimes that are prosecuted or requested for discussion, the private prosecutor may withdraw the private prosecution before the conclusion of the first instance debate. However, those with a principal penalty of seven years or more as an accessory penalty may not withdraw the private prosecution. This is slightly different from the old law.</p>
<p>Under the old law, the appellate body for second instance simple civil and criminal cases was the local court of the same court. At the beginning of the trial, a collegiate system was adopted. Now, after changing to three trials, the second instance of all cases, regardless of size, belongs to the Second Branch High Court. Therefore, the collegiate panel of the local court will also be abolished on July 1st. After the reform of the trial system, the number of second instance appeal cases accepted by the Second Branch High Court will inevitably increase. The existing number of judges seems to be insufficient. President Shen has ordered Zhang Qinglan, Cha Liangjian, and Shi Meiyu, three judges from the First Special Court, to work at the Second Branch High Court starting from July 1st. Ni Zhengyu and Wu Xiangzu, two incumbent judges of the Second Branch High Court, will be assigned to the First Special Court. In addition, Qiao Wanxuan, a judge of the First Special Court, has been promoted to Chief Prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, and Judge Xiang Yinghua has also been transferred to Anhui. The two vacancies left behind have been filled by Huang Daxi and Zhou Jiantang, who have been sent to Shanghai by the Ministry.</p>
<p>The authority of the prosecutors in the Special District cannot be fully exercised due to the limitations of the agreements. Under the old Criminal Law, only crimes stipulated in Articles 103 to 186 could be investigated. The new Criminal Law has moved these clauses to Articles 100 to 172. Therefore, the prosecutors of the First Special District must change to accepting Articles 100 to 172. This is only a movement of the clauses, and there is no change in the crimes stipulated in the legal provisions.</p>
<p>The First Special District Court has always assigned three judges to handle enforcement cases to avoid backlog. After July 1st, it is heard that all enforcement cases will be handled by clerks, and only one judge will be appointed as supervisor.</p>
<p>The Second Branch High Court and the First Special Court usually take their summer vacation from July 1st to the end of September each year. This year, they will still follow the summer vacation practice, and the office hours in the morning will be moved forward to 8:00 a.m. After the afternoon break, trials must still be held for urgent cases.</p>

<h3>Jiang Bocheng Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday Afternoon; Chen Jitang's Representative Sun Jiazhe Arrived Together; Jiang and Sun Expressed That the Southwest Is Quite Peaceful; Scheduled to Enter Nanjing on the 2nd to Report to Sichuan</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Jiang Bocheng, representative of Chairman Chiang, previously stationed in the Southwest to liaise on bandit suppression military affairs, arrived in Shanghai on June 28th with Sun Jiazhe, a member of the Fujian Provincial Government representing Chen Jitang, Chairman of the Guangdong Provincial Government, aboard the Changxing Company's Russian Empress. They arrived here at 12:30 noon yesterday and docked at the Gonghexiang Wharf. Among those who went to welcome them were Yang De Zhao, representative of Chen Jitang stationed in Nanjing, and many of Jiang's relatives and friends. After getting off the ship, Jiang and Sun went directly to Jiang's residence in the French Concession to rest. Jiang and Sun met with reporters on the ship yesterday afternoon and expressed that the Southwest is currently quite peaceful, and the military and political authorities are sincerely supporting the Central Government. External rumors are absolutely unbelievable. According to Jiang, Chen Jiliang, Vice Minister of the Navy, is responsible for handling the return of the Haiqi and Haishen warships to the north, and there is no problem at all. He and Sun Jiazhe are scheduled to take an early train to Nanjing on the 2nd to report to the Central Government and then go to Chengdu to pay a visit to Chairman Chiang and report everything in person. As for whether he will still be stationed in the Southwest in the future, it has not been decided yet.</p>
<h3>Tao Lüqian Discusses Recent Internal Measures: Four Principles Drafted for the Baojia System</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Tao Lüqian, Political Vice Minister of the Interior acting as Minister, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing the day before yesterday. A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to inquire about any specific missions for his trip to Shanghai. According to Tao, there are many government affairs in the Ministry that should be handled in accordance with Minister Huang Yingbai's instructions. He heard that Minister Huang would be going to Mogan Mountain in a few days, so he came to discuss everything. He also took the opportunity to have his teeth examined in Shanghai as he had been suffering from toothache recently. The reporter then asked if it was true that President Wang was feeling unwell, as had been reported. Tao said that President Wang had personally presided over the temporary meeting of the Executive Yuan on the morning of the 28th. After the meeting, his temperature was slightly elevated, probably due to overwork. He was also asked about the dismissed staff of the Ministry of the Interior who had distributed leaflets attacking their superiors and petitioned the Executive Yuan for reinstatement. He was asked if this matter had been resolved. Tao said that this was purely initiated by one or two people and not the entire group. He did not want to comment on this. What he could say was that he had been acting as Minister of the Interior for four months and had not changed a single person. These layoffs were carried out in accordance with central government orders and according to performance evaluation procedures. The reporter then asked about the recent measures taken by the Ministry of the Interior. Tao said that the implementation of the Baojia system had been decided by the Central Political Council. The Ministry is now drafting four principles to be submitted to the Executive Yuan for referral to the Central Political Council for a decision. Once a decision is made, implementation measures will be drafted. In the future, the separate regulations of various provinces will also be consulted in order to incorporate the opinions of local governments, so that it can be promoted nationwide.</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Petitions the Municipal Government to Ban Bizarre Clothing and Stipulates that Clothing Materials Must Use Domestic Products</h3>
<p>The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce submitted a petition to the Municipal Government yesterday, stating that the matter concerns the submission of a petition. On the 23rd of this month, the affiliated association held the Sixth Session of the Members' Representative Assembly. According to the proposal of the Pawnbrokers' Association, the Municipal Government should be petitioned to order the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to follow the clothing styles for men and women stipulated by Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of the Interior, to make them widely known, and to limit the use of domestic products. It stated that foreign goods are being dumped, prices are plummeting, and the styles of men's and women's clothing are constantly changing. Moreover, women's clothing prefers to use rayon fabrics to make qipao shirts and trousers, and the cost of materials and labor is not worth one-tenth of the price. Once made, the style changes again, and they all become waste, which is a huge loss and hinders livelihood. Therefore, pawnbrokers are full of goods, and clothes are out of fashion. The pawning price is reduced to 50%, 60%, or 70%, and still no one cares. Industries such as clothing stores, silk and satin, and cloth shops sell very little, goods are piled up, and losses are even greater, making it impossible to maintain them. Closures occur from time to time. It is now urgent to think of ways to remedy the situation. The only way is to petition the Municipal Government to order the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to follow the styles of men's and women's clothing stipulated by Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of the Interior last year, to make them widely known, and to limit the use of domestic silk, satin, gauze, cotton, and summer cloth, and to prohibit bizarre clothing. It is also requested to inform the industry associations and the clothing store industry associations to make clothes according to the style, in order to emphasize the law and maintain customs, etc. It was found that this case was brought up by the association at the general assembly last year. It was considered that the pawnbroking industry is the only shortcut for the poor to borrow money, and maintaining the pawnbroking industry indirectly protects the livelihood of the poor. In recent years, the styles of women's clothing have changed too rapidly, and it is difficult to resell them after the expiration of the deadline. Many pawnbroking businesses have closed down because of this. The way to remedy the situation is to ban bizarre clothing and promote the use of domestic goods. It has already been petitioned to the Executive Yuan to issue a general order for implementation. Now that the New Life Movement is being vigorously carried out throughout the country, according to the covenant, men's and women's clothing should be simple, and clothing materials should be domestic products. Everyone should abide by this. Shanghai is a model for all regions and should be earnestly implemented to take the lead. The general assembly has decided to forward the case to the Municipal Government for review and approval, and to order the Public Security Bureau and the Social Affairs Bureau to strictly ban bizarre clothing for men and women at any time, and to limit the use of domestic goods as soon as possible, in order to cherish the country's material resources and maintain the livelihood of farmers and workers. This is for the public convenience.</p>
<h3>Municipal Agricultural Experiment Field: Special Contract Farming Measures to Improve the Cultivation of Cotton, Rice, and Wheat Approved by the Municipal Government for Implementation</h3>
<p>The Municipal Agricultural Experiment Field of this city has been established since 1930, and it has been five years since then. The cultivation and breeding of cotton, rice, and wheat have all achieved considerable results, and superior varieties have also been selected. However, because the farmers in various townships of this city urgently need good seeds, if the field directly supplies them every year, the number of seeds produced is limited, making it difficult to popularize them. Moreover, if a small number of good seeds are scattered in inferior farmland, the result is that the good seeds are also degraded. The field is now actively promoting the use of good seeds and maintaining the purity of the seeds. Special contract farming measures have been drafted for compliance and implementation. The Special Contract Farming Measures are excerpted as follows: Shanghai Municipal Agricultural Experiment Field Special Contract Farming Measures: (1) These measures are specifically formulated to improve the cultivation methods of cotton, rice, and wheat, and to promote the propagation of superior seeds. (2) Any diligent and hardworking farmer who is interested in a special contract should fill out a letter of application and apply to the field for registration. (Application forms will be issued separately.) After the field investigates and deems them qualified, a special contract certificate will be issued. (3) The seeds belonging to the special contract farmland shall be supplied by the field and shall not be mixed with other impure seeds. (4) The farmers shall be responsible for providing the farm tools, fertilizers, and labor required for cultivation in the special contract farmland. However, the methods of cultivation and fertilization shall be subject to the guidance of the personnel sent by the field and shall not be violated. (5) Before harvesting the crops in the special contract farmland, the field shall be notified in advance to send personnel to inspect and evaluate them. If the yield per mu is less than that of the neighboring farmland, the field may provide appropriate subsidies. (6) The products of the special contract farmland that are of excellent quality shall be purchased by the field. (7) Outstanding special contract farmers shall be given awards by the field to encourage them. (8) The term of the special contract shall be limited to one year for the time being, and may be continued upon mutual agreement after the expiration of the term. (9) These measures shall be submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and implementation.</p>
<h3>Inaccurate Reporting by "New Life Weekly": Municipal Government, Yielding to Japanese Demands, Bans Publication; Court Summons Person in Charge and Author</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the "New Life Weekly," Volume 2, No. 15, published by the "New Life Weekly" in Fuzhou Road, Public Concession, contained an article entitled "Idle Talk about the Emperor," which discussed the Japanese political system. Some of the sentences involved the Japanese imperial family, and the Japanese Consul-General considered them disrespectful. He negotiated with the Municipal Government, demanding that the publication of the journal be banned, reprinting be prohibited, and the person in charge of the journal and the author of the article be punished. The Mayor apologized and guaranteed that the same incident would not happen again in the future. It is reported that Mayor Wu believes that the words in the journal are indeed inappropriate, and sympathizes with the special difficulties. He has accepted the points requested by the Japanese Consul-General and ordered the Public Security Bureau to handle them separately. However, since the office is located in the concession, the case has been transferred to the Second Branch of the Higher Court for handling in accordance with the law. The court has summoned Du Chongyuan, the person in charge of the journal, and Yi Shui, the author of the article, once, but neither appeared in court. The hearing has been rescheduled. It is also reported that Mr. Nakata, Secretary of the Japanese Consulate, attended the court hearing as an observer.</p>

<h3>Truth About the Arrest of Communist Yuan Shu</h3>
<p>According to Huadong News Agency, regarding the case of the arrest of Communist Yuan Shu, the person in charge of the Municipal Government recently issued a statement saying that Yuan Shu's arrest was due to his involvement in a case with a foreign communist. He has been escorted to Wuchang along with the foreign communist for handling in accordance with the law. It is also reported that the police have photographed and kept the evidence related to the case. The Japanese newspapers reported that Yuan was arrested for having dealings with the Japanese. After the reporter made efforts to inquire from all parties concerned for several days, it is believed that this news must be what the people of Shanghai are most willing to hear. Therefore, the information obtained from the interrogation is recorded as follows: Yuan Shu, also known as Yuan Xueyi, Yuan Xiaoyi, Rong Jun, etc., is a native of Hubei. He studied in Japan. He was originally a communist. After surrendering two years ago, he engaged in journalism. Recently, he worked for the Wai Yu News Agency. Because Yuan had a deep relationship with the Communist Party in the past, even though he had surrendered, he could not completely sever ties with the Communist Party and still served as a secret worker for the Communist Party. In May of this year, the Investigation Team of the Garrison Command, together with the Police Department of the Public Concession, captured Joseph Waldron, the mastermind of the Third International Shanghai Gebert Bird Agency of an unidentified foreign communist in Fuxu Road. At that time, Yuan Shu's handwritten letter and address under the pseudonym Rong Jun were found on the foreign communist's person. The police believed that Yuan Shu was a major suspect in the case and summoned Yuan to question him twice at the address, but Yuan absconded. Therefore, the police notified the Investigation Team of the Garrison Command in late May to investigate and arrest him together. The Investigation Team of the Garrison Command arrested Yuan a few days after the police notified them. When Yuan was arrested, he did not admit to serving as a secret worker for the Communist Party again. After verification, his handwriting matched the handwritten letter of the foreign communist. Yuan admitted the truth without denial after being identified by the co-defendant Wang Moqing in person. Wang Moqing is also related to this case and was arrested by the Garrison Command together with the Public Concession Police Department. It was found that the case of the foreign communist was first cracked by the Communist Party organs in Wuchang, which discovered secret documents. Based on this clue, Shanghai first arrested Lu Haifang. Lu Haifang confessed to the foreign communist. The foreign communist discovered that Yuan Shu was again related to the Communist Party and was working as a counter-intelligence worker under the foreign communist. Because the case was initiated in Wuchang, the foreign communist and Yuan Shu were escorted to Wuchang for trial.</p>
<h3>U.S. Economic Mission Reception Office Announces Closure</h3>

<h3>Wusong Telephone Relay Line Reconnection Project Completed Last Night; Dial "77181" First to Talk to Wusong</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Communications believes that the location of the Wusong Branch is north of the newly established City Center Branch. The original relay line of the branch was No. 41181, which went directly to the Zhabei Branch. Therefore, all telephone traffic from Wusong to the city center area had to be transferred through the Zhabei Branch, which was not economical. It has been approved by the Ministry of Communications to reconnect the relay line to the City Center Branch in order to be more appropriate. It has been learned that the reconnection project was completed the day before yesterday. The new number is 77181. It is currently being tested and the following notice has been issued: It is hereby decided that at 12:00 midnight on June 30, the relay line of the Wusong Branch under its jurisdiction will be transferred by the City Center Branch. When customers in Nanshi, Zhabei, Longhua, and the city center area talk to customers in Wusong, please dial "77181" first, and then the driver will transfer the call. This is hereby announced.</p>

<h3>Hundreds of Straw Sheds on Charity Land in Nanshi Ordered to Be Moved; More Than 500 Poor People Receive 400 Yuan in Moving Expenses</h3>
<p>Li, the Chief of the Ximen Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, acting on the order of Director Cai, stated that there is a vacant lot to the east of Cuiwei Temple on the west side of Ba'an Road, west of the Nanshi Station Back Road, which belongs to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall of the Charity Group. In recent years, it has been occupied by poor people from Shandong Jiangbei and other places who came to Shanghai, and hundreds of straw sheds have been built for residence. The Charity Group recently wanted to take it back for its own use, and repeatedly submitted requests to the Municipal Public Security Bureau for eviction. Chief Li of the Ximen Branch had ordered the representatives of the shack dwellers, Wang Binqing and others, to come to the bureau and advised them to move out, and the Charity Group paid 284 yuan in moving expenses and gave them ten days to move out. The shack dwellers were still stubborn and refused to comply. Recently, an order was received to demolish the straw sheds immediately. Wang Binqing, Li Shouyin, Chen Buqui, and others were summoned to the bureau and advised to demolish them immediately, but they refused to agree. Just as they were about to send the representatives to the General Bureau for review, Yang Wenqi and other men and women, more than 500 shack dwellers, learned of the matter and gathered at the Simen Branch yesterday afternoon at 2:00 p.m. to petition. As a result, Chief Li of the Branch gave gentle guidance and told them that occupying land should be subject to legal punishment, but for the sake of consideration, he asked the charity to add 400 yuan in moving expenses. Then, the shack dwellers signed and agreed to move out within 20 days, and the money would be collected from the bureau on the day of the move. The representatives of the shack dwellers were then released.</p>

<h3>Artificial Green Jadeite Discovered in the Pearl and Jade Market in This City; Female Customer Almost Deceived by Inability to Take Her Eyes Off of it; Confiscated and Fined After Being Detected by the Market</h3>
<p>According to Dagong News Agency, the green goods market for the pearl and jade industry in Houjia Bridge is most prosperous from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. Anyone, even if they are not in the industry, can enter to buy ornaments. A week ago, Wang Jinchang, a broker from Zhenjiang who was engaged in the pearl and jade business, offered to sell emerald horse eyes (a kind of ornament with pointed ends, used for setting rings). A female customer surnamed Mou was also selecting ornaments in the market, and when she saw the emerald horse eyes, she was attracted by their moving color, and she was unable to take her eyes off of it. Just as the transaction was about to be completed, a market staff member caught a glimpse of it and found that the horse eyes were fake after a detailed inspection. The color was entirely artificially dyed. He believed that the broker was selling counterfeit goods in the market, which would damage the reputation of the market. He reported to Wang Yousong, the chairman of the industry market, who investigated the source of the horse eyes. He replied that he had carelessly purchased them from a person named A Hu outside the city and did not dare to fake them himself. Seeing that his words were still sincere, he was lenient and confiscated the horse eyes, displayed them in the market to warn others, and fined him five yuan, which was used for charity. In order to prevent future occurrences, the market is now drafting measures to prevent the recurrence of the aforementioned.</p>

<h3>Borrowing Zhu Xuefan's Name, Indiscriminately Issuing Wedding Invitations for Fraudulent Gain, Zhu Jinfang Arrested by the French Concession Police Yesterday, to Be Sent to the Second Special Court for Trial This Morning</h3>
<p>Zhu Jinfang, a local resident aged 25, became impoverished due to prolonged unemployment. He conceived a bizarre idea to impersonate Zhu Xuefan, chairman of the Shanghai General Labor Union, claiming that "Zhan would marry his younger sister Wanzhen on July 1st, with a wedding feast respectfully prepared at the Taihe Garden on Second Malu," and indiscriminately issued invitations. The cover was printed with the address "No. 12, Zhongshun Xinli, Laoshifu Road, French Concession." After receiving the invitations, Zhu's relatives and friends inquired about the truth and discovered that it was a case of impersonation, attempting to defraud and obtain money. This matter was discovered by the French Concession police authorities, who dispatched detectives to the aforementioned address yesterday to investigate. Zhu Jinfang was arrested. Upon questioning the sublessor, it was revealed that Zhu had only moved in for a little over ten days, renting a room on the upper floor for three and a half yuan per month. Inside the room, besides a few bedding items, there was nothing of value. However, many scrolls and banners sent by various parties were confiscated. They were immediately taken to the Lujiawan Police Station for detention. A telephone inquiry to Taihe Garden revealed that there was no event scheduled under Zhu's name for July 1st. The police station, considering the case involved fraud and obtaining money, will send him to the Second Special District Court today for investigation and prosecution according to the law.</p>
<h3>Reorganization Meeting of the Chongde Native Place Association</h3>
<p>The Chongde Native Place Association in Shanghai has been established for many years but has not yet registered. Recently, with a large number of members and increasingly complex affairs, a sound organization is necessary to ensure progress. Therefore, on May 14th, the association's former standing committee members Sheng Peidong, Hua Zhenxin, and representatives from Chongde's business and academic circles in Shanghai, including Dai Linshu, Wu Xinqi, and dozens of others, jointly submitted a request to the Municipal Party Department for a permit. On June 24th, after receiving permit number 62 from the Municipal Party Department, they convened the first preparatory meeting at the Quan Jiafu Western Restaurant on Fuzhou Road yesterday. They elected Sheng Peidong, Hua Zhenxin, Wu Xinqi, Dai Linshu, Shen Yu, Hu Weide, Xu Jiaofan, Hu Qiujiang, Tian Heming, Cao Zhongqing, and Cai Jingxiong as eleven preparatory committee members.

<h3>Undecided Dispute of the Jiangyin Native Place Association</h3>
<p>The Jiangyin Native Place Association in Shanghai held its inaugural general meeting on June 23rd at the Hu She. Due to incomplete procedures, Mao Yun, a representative from the Municipal Party Department, stopped the meeting and ordered it to be postponed. The temporary chairman, Li Zhiyun, then declared it a discussion meeting, which was suddenly treated as a formal meeting, leading to opposition from over a thousand people, including Qian Shixia. Yesterday was the date for the ballot counting. However, because the association's procedures were non-compliant and the dispute was unresolved, the party and government authorities did not send representatives to participate, resulting in the failure of the ballot counting.</p>

<h3>Impersonating Police Officers to Extort Money, Wang Yin and Others Each Sentenced to One Year Imprisonment</h3>
<p>Wang Yin, a Shaoxing native who previously worked as a lawyer's clerk, colluded with his fellow townsman Wang Bingsheng and a French rogue to impersonate French police officers with inspection warrants on the morning of the 8th of last month. They went to Zhang Jieyi and Chen Mou, vendors at stalls No. 9 and 10 in the Taiping Alley vegetable market, inspected their licenses, and accused them of using false names. They then took Zhang and Chen to a small teahouse at No. 301 Kaizi'erni Road under the guise of bringing them to the police station and extorted 100 yuan from Zhang and Chen. As a result, because Zhang and others were unable to pay, they settled for 30 yuan. Because Zhang and others had no money on them, they paid 10 yuan first and promised to pay the rest in the afternoon. Zhang and others were then able to escape and reported the incident to the French police station. Detectives Wang Zhihao and Zhou Ruzhang arrested the two defendants, Wang and Wang, and sent them to the Second Special Court. The police department's lawyer prosecuted them for the crime of intimidation and fraud. All details were reported previously. This case has been concluded by Wang Gangxu, the presiding judge of the Second Special Court's criminal division. On the 6th of this month, Wang Yin and Wang Bingsheng were sentenced to one year of imprisonment each for intending to illegally possess the property of others by intimidating them into handing over their belongings. The number of days in custody before the judgment is final will be deducted from the imprisonment term at a rate of two days for each day of imprisonment. During the appeal period, the defendants will be transferred to the detention center.</p>
<h3>Case of Police Officer Abusing Handcuffs Has Been Prosecuted</h3>
<p>Zhao Jinquan, a detective of the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, recently filed a complaint with the Procuratorate of the District Court against Nie Shaowen, a police officer of the Liyuan Road Substation of the Ximen Branch, and Sergeant Zhang Dasi, for abusing handcuffs, causing injuries to both arms and unbearable pain. He requested an investigation. After Prosecutor Wu Deying examined the injuries, he ordered Nie and others to be summoned to court for investigation and released on bail. All details were reported previously. It is now known that Prosecutor Wu found that the cause of this case was that on June 3rd, Zhao Jinquan arrested two suspected thieves, Cai Xiaoyun and Geng Zhongyi, in the Xinqiao area, and was preparing to send them to the Public Security Bureau for interrogation. Nie Shaowen believed that Zhao Jinquan's arrest of the suspects en route without the cooperation of the patrol police was inappropriate and suspected fraud. Therefore, Zhao was handcuffed. However, Zhao Jinquan insisted that Cai and Geng were repeat offenders and had witnessed them stealing money from Gu Longting, an apprentice at the Yuanyuan Tobacco Paper Store. However, Gu and the store owner, Tang Ruiwen, denied the theft. The case was complex and confusing, and the truth was difficult to ascertain. Therefore, a letter was sent to the Public Security Bureau to send Cai Xiaoyun and Geng Zhongyi to the case for a detailed investigation. After a long period of interrogation, the truth of the case was finally revealed. They were ordered to be detained separately. Nie Shaowen and Zhang Dasi were prosecuted in the criminal court according to the law and will be publicly tried soon. It is said that the Public Security Bureau has dismissed Nie, Zhang, and Zhao from their positions and is awaiting trial by the court.</p>
<h3>Elementary School Student Falls into a Sewer and Dies, Body Found Yesterday</h3>
<p>On the afternoon of the day before yesterday at around 3:00 PM, a seven-year-old boy named Ah Xing, who studied at a school on North Chengdu Road and lived at No. 15 Taide Li, Xinhaizha Road, west of Chibang Bridge, fell into a sewer while playing with a small ball on the road after school. At that time, the sewer was being cleared, and the manhole was open and uncovered. While Ah Xing was trying to grab the ball, he accidentally fell into the manhole. The diameter of the manhole was extremely wide. Although rescuers were immediately dispatched after he fell, the child had disappeared. Until around 10:00 AM yesterday, the body had floated to the mouth of the Suzhou River at Dtong Road, where it was recovered by a boatman. The body was immediately sent to the post-mortem examination office on Feilun Road, Hongkou, for examination.</p>
<h3>Zhengyi Society Members Travel to Qingdao</h3>
<p>Qingdao is located east of Jiaozhou Bay, surrounded by the sea on three sides, with excellent scenery, shady trees, a moderate climate, and drinking water from Laoshan. Canals run into the sea, making the city exceptionally clean. Land and water transport, as well as aviation, are all available, making transportation very convenient. Its municipal facilities are well-developed, making it the leading port in East Asia. Chinese and foreign people alike consider it a summer resort. This year, the Ministry of Railways is holding the Fourth Railway Exhibition in Qingdao, bringing together the finest domestic products from along the country's railways in one place. Business tycoons from various provinces are bound to flock to observe, making it a lively event. It is now reported that the Zhengyi Society on the seventh floor of the Continental Emporium on Nanjing Road plans to take advantage of this rare grand occasion to organize a second summer trip to Qingdao, both to escape the summer heat and to feast their eyes, a deeply meaningful endeavor. They have also contacted the state-run China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to reserve cabins on the new Northern Ocean route ships Haiheng and Haili. The society's travel department will send personnel to Qingdao immediately to make preliminary arrangements. This trip to Qingdao will involve travel by sea and return by land, passing through the Jiaoji, Jinpu, and Jinghu railway lines, allowing the society's travelers to enjoy the scenery along the way.</p>
<h3>Seducing an Underage Girl, Police File Public Prosecution</h3>
<p>Jiang Maolang, a native of Chongming, lives at No. 4, Lane 442, Yulin Road, and sells vegetables at a nearby vegetable market. He has a daughter named Xiaoqing, who is seventeen years old and has a beautiful appearance. She is the apple of her father's eye. She was recently seduced by Cao Yilang, a resident of Haimen, and became pregnant. Cao was anxious and entrusted Yang Xuefan and Ding Laoming, both from Tongzhou, to find an old woman to perform an abortion. They then sent her to a Xin Hospital under the pretext of illness for two weeks. Her health improved slightly, and there was no danger to her life. Just as she was about to be discharged from the hospital, the matter was discovered by detective Liu Zhisheng of the Yulin Police Station, who informed the girl's father, Jiang Maolang, and arrested Cao Yilang and Yang and Ding. Xiaoqing was also charged with the crime of secretly undergoing an abortion and was sent to the First Special District Court along with the others. The old woman who performed the abortion fled and could not be apprehended. The girl's body has not fully recovered. Wang Yaotang, a lawyer for the Public Works Department, requested that Cao be additionally charged with seduction and requested a postponement. The girl was temporarily taken back by her father. Cao, Yang, and Ding were remanded in custody. Yesterday, the police formally filed a public prosecution against Cao for the crime of seducing a girl under the age of twenty and sent Cao and the other two defendants back to the Third Criminal Court. Because the case involved public morals, the public was prohibited from attending the hearing. After interrogating the defendants, Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered them to be remanded in custody and await sentencing at a later date.</p>

<h3>Public Concession Tram and Bus Dares Not to Carry Too Many Passengers, Police Board Cars to Count, Violators Punished According to Regulations</h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the Public Concession's Public Works Department's Health Department has ordered trams and buses within the concession to not exceed the prescribed number of passengers to prevent the spread of infectious diseases during the summer months. The police and Health Department will send personnel to inspect various locations. If any violations are found, they will board the vehicles to count the passengers and impose penalties. Therefore, various vehicles have not dared to carry too many passengers in recent days and have added more trips. It is said that this measure will be lifted in August. However, carrying too many passengers on vehicles obstructs traffic for passengers getting on and off. Furthermore, after limiting passengers, thefts on vehicles can be avoided. Therefore, even after the ban expires, the Public Works Department will continue to impose restrictions.</p>
<h3>Police Arrest Prostitutes, Two Prostitutes Give Pitiful Confessions, Sentenced to be Sent to the Bureau for Relief</h3>
<p>At 1:00 AM yesterday, Shen Zhenhua, the chief of the Laobeimen Police Station, ordered patrol officers Mu Hongzao and Wang Xinqing to search for prostitutes soliciting customers along the streets of Xinqiao Street on Minguo Road. When the pimps saw the police, they gave a signal, and everyone fled towards the French Concession, making it difficult to pursue and arrest. Only two prostitutes were arrested and brought to the station for questioning. According to the confession of the defendant Ye Wangshi, 35 years old, from Nanjing, residing at No. 217 Dajing Road, her husband died of illness this spring, leaving behind a 60-year-old mother-in-law and two young children. Her husband was also an intellectual. After his death, because there were no savings left and no way to support the family, she repeatedly attempted suicide but was persuaded by others to think of her old mother and young children. She was forced to engage in prostitution to support the family. Another defendant, Qin Yinshi, 44 years old, from Wuxi, residing at No. 19 Tongluli, confessed that she had several children and no means of livelihood, so she resorted to this measure, which was not her wish. Chief Shen sympathized with their situation and ordered them to be sent to the Bureau for relief.</p>
<h3>After the Dahua Fire, Family Members of the Victims Negotiate, Entrusting Four Lawyers Including Wang Xianggu to Handle the Matter</h3>
<p>The fire at the Dahua Celluloid Factory on Xiaoshadu Road destroyed more than a dozen houses in Yongqing Li, killing and injuring more than 70 people, making it the largest factory disaster in recent years. The factory's warehouse caught fire once before on August 1st of last year and was extinguished. At that time, the residents of Yongqing Li were already quite alarmed. Therefore, all the residents of Yongqing Li entrusted lawyer Wang Xianggu to send a letter to the factory, urging it to pay attention to the safety of the residents, and set a deadline to demolish the fences and build higher brick walls or take other effective measures. The person in charge of the factory expressed acceptance to the residents' representatives Qin Bukun and Yan Shunqing and promised to do so immediately. However, nearly a year has passed, and construction has not yet begun, resulting in this disaster. Now, Qin Bukun, Yan Shaoping, Wu Shaowen, Liu Songshou, and other representatives of the victims' families have again entrusted lawyer Wang Xianggu and lawyers Sun Juwu, Wei Weiqing, and Tao Han to handle the matter and have organized a fire disaster victims' family committee to handle registration and investigation procedures in preparation for litigation.</p>
<h3>Bean Curd Industry in the City Suspended Operations Yesterday, Rectifying Market Prices, Resumed Operations This Morning After Persuasion by the Association, Implementing New Price List, Retail Prices Have Risen</h3>
<p>The bean curd industry in this city suspended all operations yesterday to rectify market prices. After the industry association convened and persuaded its members yesterday afternoon, all are expected to resume operations as usual this morning. The following is a report from the Datong News Agency reporter:</p>
<p>Rectifying Market Prices: The bean curd industry in this city is divided into six districts: Hunan, Zhabei, Huxi, Pudong, and Zhong District (i.e., the British and French Concessions). Excluding street vendors, there are more than 600 businesses in the industry. Due to the rising exchange rate of copper coins and the fact that the industry's revenue is based on copper coins while soybeans and raw materials must be calculated in foreign currency, as well as the impact of the sluggish market, businesses inevitably lower prices to attract customers.</p>
<p>Suspension of Operations Yesterday: The bean curd industry association in this city, in order to rectify the situation, convened its fourth executive committee meeting on the 28th of this month and decided to implement price adjustments on July 1st and establish a uniform price list to be distributed to each store for implementation. However, in order to make the outside world understand the determination to rectify, all businesses voluntarily suspended operations for one day yesterday, especially in the Zhabei and Nanshi areas, which were the most unified. Even bean curd street vendors disappeared.</p>
<p>Resumption of Operations This Morning: After receiving news of the stores' suspension of operations, the industry association, fearing that incidents might occur, convened representatives from each store at the bean curd industry association at No. 19 Qiaojiazhala Road, Nanshi, at 2:00 PM yesterday. Chairman Tan Huangming earnestly persuaded them, and they agreed that it was too late to resume operations that day and promised to resume business as usual this morning. As for market prices, they will all follow the new price list after rectification and will not be allowed to have chaotic price reductions to attract customers.</p>
<p>New Price List: The selling prices of bean curd products on the new price list are significantly higher than before. The following is a summary: bean curd skin is 2,880 cash per catty, 100 cash per sheet, large bean curd is 2,000 cash per board, old bean curd is 1,400 cash per board, soft bean curd is 1,200 cash per board, fine fried dough sticks are 800 cash per catty, coarse fried dough sticks are 640 cash per catty, bean curd sheets are 560 cash per catty, 15 cash per sheet, loose fried goods are at least 5 cash, fragrant dried bean curd is 20 cash per piece, stinky dried bean curd is 20 cash per piece, triangular fried bean curd is 15 cash per piece, square fried bean curd is 5 cash per piece, fermented bean curd blanks are 1,200 cash per board, Liu Fang is 720 cash per board, all measured by market scales, and cheating on the scales is prohibited. Wholesale prices for kitchens and restaurants are 90% of the listed price, and inter-business transactions are 80% of the listed price.</p>
<h3>After Ye Zhongfang's Arrest, Court Opens Trial; Also Owes Over a Thousand Yuan to Tailor Shop; Court Requested to Combine Cases for Enforcement</h3>
<p>Ye Zhongfang, the eldest grandson of the late Ye Chengzhong, a wealthy Ningbo native who lived in Shanghai and was known by the nickname "Little Douluan," is 27 years old this year. He previously married Lu Yinglan, the daughter of Lu Shuangzhu, a wealthy Suzhou merchant. Because Ye has developed bad habits in recent years, indulging in opium and sex, and squandering his assets excessively, the love between husband and wife has broken down. His wife, Lu Yinglan, through her lawyer, filed a divorce lawsuit against Ye Zhongfang in the Civil Division of the Second Special Court, and requested a judgment for alimony. After three trials, the divorce was granted, and the defendant Ye Zhongfang was ordered to pay the plaintiff Lu Yinglan 60,000 yuan in alimony. After repeated hearings by the Second Special Court for enforcement, Ye ultimately resisted and failed to appear after being summoned. An order was issued to await arrest and investigation. The plaintiff has now discovered that Ye is hiding at No. 22, Lane 169, Carter Road in the Public Concession, and has immediately reported to the Second Special Court, requesting the First Special Court to assist in arresting the defendant. The First Special Court dispatched police officers to the address and arrested Ye Zhongfang, bringing him to the court. It is briefly recorded in this newspaper that the day before yesterday afternoon, the First Special Court transferred Ye to the Second Special Court for investigation. The enforcement judge, Yang Ding, specially opened the Sixth Tribunal for interrogation. Ye's face was sallow and his spirit was haggard due to his recent addiction to heroin. He wore glasses and an Indian silk long gown. After the judge questioned Ye about his age and origin, the plaintiff, Lu Yinglan, was represented by lawyer Dong Yu, who stated that since the defendant had been arrested and brought to court, she requested strict compulsory enforcement and demanded that the money be handed over. Ye Zhongfang's lawyer argued that although the defendant had previously received more than 200,000 yuan in assets, he had already spent it all. His current situation is very difficult, and even his personal livelihood is problematic. He now only requests to be released on ordinary bail to find ways to raise money from relatives and friends. If required to provide a guarantor for 60,000 yuan, it would be even more difficult to find one, and no one would be willing to guarantee it. He asked the court for leniency. The plaintiff's lawyer further stated that the defendant, to spite her, intentionally concealed his assets and refused to fulfill his obligations. As the defendant's agent claimed, the defendant received more than 200,000 yuan in assets, and no matter how much he squandered, it would not have been completely exhausted in seven or eight years. It is indeed intentional not to comply, and the defendant should be detained for compulsory enforcement. Furthermore, in 1932, Ye Zhongfang ordered clothes from Shuntaixiang Western Clothing Store at No. 250 Avenue Joffre, owing 1,416.30 yuan for labor and materials, which he has delayed in paying. Because Ye resided in Suzhou, the store owner filed a lawsuit in the Wuxian District Court. After the judgment was finalized, enforcement was unsuccessful, and an enforcement certificate was issued on October 31 of last year, handed to the plaintiff to await Ye's appearance for enforcement. Now, Sun Liyan, the owner of Shuntaixiang Store, has petitioned the Wuxian Court to request the First Special Court to assist in sealing up Ye's property at No. 22, Lane 169, Carter Road, and also requested the Second Special Court to assist in the Lu Yinglan v. Ye case by ordering Ye to provide additional bail. The day before yesterday, Sun Liyan, the owner of Shuntaixiang Store, also hired lawyer Lin Yingqing to represent him in filing the judgment and enforcement certificate of the Wuxian Court with the enforcement division of the Second Special Court, requesting that the cases be combined for enforcement and demanding that Ye repay the debt as soon as possible. The judge questioned Ye Zhongfang, who initially claimed he did not owe the money, and then said that even if he owed the debt, he was currently unable to repay it. Subsequently, regarding Ye's bail issue, one side requested that bail be paid in full, while the other side requested that ordinary bail be allowed. The two sides' lawyers argued for a long time. In the end, the court ordered Ye Zhongfang to provide a store guarantee that he would be available upon summons, and the guarantor should be responsible for 61,000 yuan, with ten days to raise the money or face detention. After the order was given, Ye was taken down by the court officers and temporarily detained, awaiting bail.</p>
<h3>Xu Guangxing Kidnapping Case; Car Identified; Xu's Mother's Gold Ring Snatched; Xiang Sheng Automobile Driver Summoned for Questioning</h3>
<p>Xu Guangxing, 38 years old, from Huaicheng, resides at No. 651, West Hanzhong Road, Chang'an Road, Zhabei, and runs Xu Xingji South Goods Store. He also runs Xu Xingji Beef Store at No. 653 next door, both double-fronted shops, barely making a living. Unexpectedly, he was coveted by bandits. The previous night (Friday), at 11:45 PM, Xu was returning home from watching a play at the nearby Fengxiang Theater when a car carrying kidnappers suddenly arrived. One bandit monitored the driver in the car, while two bandits got out, all wearing blue cloth shirts and trousers. At that time, Xu was at the doorway. The bandits first snatched a gold ring from Mrs. Wang's hand, and then forced Xu Guangxing into the car, speeding away to the north. The details were reported in yesterday's newspaper. At the time, there were only women and apprentices in the green store, so they did not dare to speak out. It was not until the next day that they reported to the Hengfeng Road Police Station. However, after the incident, the kidnappers had not taken any action as of yesterday evening. The car used by the kidnappers has been identified by Lu Pei, the head of the police station in charge, through detective Fang Chaofu, as a Xiang Sheng Automobile Company car, license plate number 4716. Yesterday morning, the driver was summoned for questioning and ordered to provide bail. In the afternoon, Xiang Sheng Automobile Company sent two staff members, Mr. Zhang and others, to the detective team to inquire about the matter. According to Mr. Xu, the accountant at Xu Xingji South Goods Store, Xu was carrying 230 yuan in cash when he was kidnapped, which was prepared to be deposited at the Continental Bank. The case is currently under intense investigation.</p>

<h3>Chinese Veterinary Medical Association; Inaugural Meeting Held the Day Before Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Chinese Veterinary Medical Association was initiated by Cai Wuji, director of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, Wang Zhaoji, section chief of the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, and other veterinary experts such as Cheng Shaojiong. Preparations began in April 1934, and were subsequently approved by the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Education, which issued a license. Since then, preparations have been completed. Veterinarians from Beijing, Shanghai, and other regions have enthusiastically joined the association. The inaugural meeting was held on June 29 at the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, 8th floor, Suzhou Road, in this city. Officers such as the president, secretary, and accountant were elected. The details of the meeting are listed below:</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM on June 29, the association held its first inaugural meeting. Mao Xiaxuan was sent by the Municipal Party Headquarters to provide guidance. Around sixty veterinary experts from various regions attended, including Yi Wuji and Chen Shun Chunyun from the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau, Wang Zhaoji and Wang Chunlin from the Shanghai Municipal Health Bureau, and Luo Qingsheng and Chen Zhizhang from the Agricultural College of Nanjing Central University. Wang Zhaoji was publicly elected as the temporary chairman, and Wang Chunlin recorded the minutes. After the chairman delivered the opening address, Cai Wuji reported on the preparations, stating that the preparations for the association began on April 7, 1934, when the initiators held a meeting to carry out the following items: 1. Propose the name "Chinese Veterinary Medical Association"; 2. Draft a declaration; 3. Appoint personnel to be responsible for the implementation, namely Cai Wuji, Chen Shunyun, Wang Zhaoji, Cheng Shaojiong, and Shou Biao, to prepare and implement, and report to the Municipal Party Headquarters for record in accordance with the Shanghai Municipal Social Organization Rules. In July 1934, approval was granted for filing, and a license was issued. Subsequently, seven preparatory committee members were appointed to organize the preparatory committee, temporarily using the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau as the association's address. The preparatory committee seal was also filed with the Municipal Party Headquarters and the Bureau of Education, and approvals were granted successively. By the end of January of this year, preparations were completed, and a draft of the association's charter and a list of members were prepared and submitted to the Municipal Party Headquarters for review. On March 2, approval was granted for filing. This is a general overview of the past preparations. However, most members from various regions are unable to attend the meeting today due to their duties. It is hoped that the attendees today will convey the situation of today's meeting to those colleagues who did not attend. Subsequently, Mao Xiaxuan from the Municipal Party Headquarters delivered a speech, stating that everyone is a veterinary expert, and he is an outsider, so he is not qualified to provide guidance. He would like to briefly state his personal thoughts. According to him, our country is an agricultural country, and the importance of animal husbandry is self-evident. However, in the past, people often neglected the animal husbandry industry and did not pay much attention to it. In recent decades, people have gradually begun to mention it. Now, experts are organizing groups to study animal husbandry and veterinary medicine, prevent and control animal diseases, improve medicine, and prepare for improvement. In the future, it will benefit the society and the people, which is extremely important. Our country has a 5,000-year cultural history, and various inventions were the earliest. Now, it has fallen behind Western countries. The main reason is that the feudal ideology of the past was too deep, and everyone held on to their secrets, unable to openly study and progress. Since the establishment of the National Government, in view of this, it has allowed free groups to form associations, so that they can learn from each other and discuss. Therefore, cultural, educational, economic, and other groups have been established one after another. However, judging from the various groups in Shanghai, the majority can be pragmatic, follow their purpose, and promote and develop, achieving remarkable results. However, there are also many that are nominal and fizzle out. Today is the beginning of the establishment of your association. It is hoped that it will base itself on its established purpose, exert its strength, benefit society and the people, and benefit the animal husbandry economy. It is self-evident that Shanghai is the largest city in our country, holding the hub of national economy and culture. The organization of this association by everyone will have an impact on the whole country, arousing public attention and making them aware of the importance of veterinary and animal husbandry. In the future, benefiting the people and influencing the social economy will be immeasurable. In addition, Mr. Cai Wuji and other gentlemen, with their knowledge and morality, have long been admired by society, leading the way, and the future is bright. Finally, it is hoped that literacy schools will be established in accordance with the group organization law, and that they will be carried out as soon as possible, with many words of encouragement. Then, a public election was held. As a result, Cai Wuji was elected as the president, Wang Zhaoji as the secretary, and Wu Deming as the accountant. Subsequently, the president Cai Wuji proposed the establishment of four committees to be responsible for the implementation, namely: 1. Membership Recruitment Committee, responsible by Cui Buqing; 2. Publication Editorial Committee, responsible by Luo Qingsheng; 3. Veterinary Education Promotion Committee, responsible by Wang Zhaoji; 4. Veterinary Law. Li Wenbin, a Ningbo native who runs Fushengxiang Button Store at No. 138 Avenue Edward VII in the French Concession, was suddenly robbed by three bandits at noon on the 12th of last month. They broke into the store under the pretext of renting a house, showed a handgun, and threatened the occupants. Because they found no cash, they snatched a gold ring from the hand of Li's wife, Wang. The victim followed behind and shouted for help. The robbers fled to the intersection of Avenue Vermont and Avenue Joffre, and when they realized that someone was chasing them, they opened fire to resist arrest, hitting a Chinese constable at No. 68 and a male pedestrian. They fled to Li Mei Road, where they were surrounded and arrested by detectives and reserve forces. One of the robbers, Chen Shi, was shot and captured on the spot, and a handgun was seized. They were taken back to the police station. Later, six accomplices were arrested, including Liu Yulong, Lin Changgen, Tang Bingguang (aka Little Guangdong), female robber Li Wang, and Chen Wang. Another handgun and stolen goods such as silver chopsticks were confiscated. They were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and detention. During the interrogation, Tang confessed to robbery and shooting incidents in Yangshupu. The Police Department prosecuted them for attempted robbery and murder. The Second Special Court judge Li Changnian concluded the trial. The day before yesterday, Judge Li came to the court to pronounce the verdict. Representatives from the Shanghai District Court and the First Special Court were present, requesting to take custody. The court ordered the defendants to be brought forward. Chen Bao was sentenced to eight years of imprisonment for continuous conspiracy of three people carrying weapons for robbery, and eight years of imprisonment for attempted murder to avoid punishment, to be executed for thirteen years. Liu Yulong was sentenced to ten years and six months of imprisonment, Lin Changgen was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment, Tang Bingguang was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment, Li Wang was sentenced to six months of imprisonment for covering up stolen goods, suspended for one year, Chen Wang was found not guilty, two handguns and nine bullets were confiscated. After the verdict, the court ordered that the Shanghai District Court and the First Special Court would take custody today. The four robbers, Chen, Liu, Lin, and Tang, were handed over to the First Special Court for investigation. The two women were temporarily detained in the detention center.</p>
<h3>Youth Service Group to Promote Rickshaw Services Starts Summer Work Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Youth Service Group of the New Life Movement Promotion Association began its summer service yesterday, the first day. Any members can freely choose to serve in the morning or afternoon for two hours. Except for a small number who stopped due to rain, the members of the group in all eleven districts of the city served in the rain, with high spirits.

<h3>Lu Wang Entices Wang Lu, Paramour Ding A Xiang Escapes</h3>
<p>Wang Lu, a woman from Wuxi, nineteen years old, was enticed to Shanghai by Lu Wang, a woman from the same village, under the pretext of recommending her as a female worker in a yarn factory. She was housed in a small inn near the East Xin Bridge on Avenue Edward VII. Lu secretly instructed her paramour, Ding A Xiang, to forcibly rape Wang and prevent her from leaving, intending to take her to another port for sale. Wang cried in the room. The tea room attendant heard about it and inquired, and secretly reported it to Xie Wanfang, a Chinese detective in the Public Concession. Xie arrested Lu Wang, but Ding A Xiang escaped. Both Wang and Lu were taken to the police station and sent to the First Special District Court. After questioning, the facts were confirmed. Lu Wang was sentenced to three years and six months of imprisonment as a warning. The trial of Ding A Xiang was suspended until he is arrested.</p>

The service locations for this year's second graduates have also been mostly determined. The school's engineering students usually pay attention to practice. After the completion of this semester's courses, the third-year students, led by teacher Zhan Ziyi, went to the Shanghai-Hangzhou area to visit various important projects. The second-year students, led by teacher Sun Yunyan, went to Nanjing Central University to do various tests on material strength and hydraulics, and visited the Jiangning Autonomous Experimental County Government and important projects such as the Jinshi Power Vehicle Water. The first-year students, led by teacher Wang Boyuan, went to the Slender West Lake area, a scenic spot in the north of Yangzhou City, for on-site measurement, which will be used as the basis for the entire landscape and construction of the Jiangdu Plan. After the second-year students return to school, they will be led by teacher Zhan Ziyi from July 1st to various places such as the Jiangbei Canal Engineering Bureau and the Shaobo Ship Lock Engineering Bureau under the Huai River Guidance Committee of Jiangsu Province for a one-month internship. It is also learned that a small number of students will go to Jiangning Experimental County for surveying and mapping internships.</p>

<p>Hwakang Track and Field Team Resolves to Merge with Yousheng Travel Group, Renaming as Yousheng Track and Field Team. The general assembly passed the resolution yesterday, electing Wang Zheng Lin as the captain and appointing three committee members.</p>
<p>The Hwakang Track and Field Team, which holds a central position in Shanghai's track and field sports, convened its fifth general meeting of all members at 10:00 AM yesterday at the Postal Workers' Union meeting hall at No. 9, Lane 538, Bazhi Road, to discuss important matters and re-elect officers for the current term. All team members attended, and the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Merger with Yousheng: Since its establishment last year, the Hwakang team has expanded its operations and seen a rapid increase in talent, leading to a corresponding increase in various expenses. Due to financial constraints, a proposal was made at yesterday's meeting to merge with the Yousheng Travel Group. The proposal was unanimously approved, and the team will officially merge with the Yousheng Travel Group. Furthermore, the Hwakang team will be officially dissolved and renamed, but the team members will remain unchanged.

<p>Economic Supplement: The Dynamics of Sichuan's Currency System (Continued) Zhao Zun Bai</p>
<p>Corner Coins</p>
<p>(1) Dragon Corner: Minted by various mints in the Qing Dynasty, divided into double corner and single corner types. Circulated in southern Sichuan and the Zigong area, with no circulation in other regions. Zigong and Rongchang used corner coins as the main currency, but taxes were levied at 11.8 corner coins per silver dollar. All transactions were valued in corner coins. In ancient Song Qingfu and other counties, 12 corner coins were equivalent to one silver dollar. Dazu County only used them in the county seat and southwestern areas, with northeastern areas refusing to accept them.</p>
<p>(2) Mao Yang: Minted in Guangdong, commonly used in various counties in southern Sichuan, such as Luxian, Xufu, Zigong, Neijiang, and Wujia Township in Rongchang, at a discount of 60% or 70%. The circulation situation was very complex and chaotic. For example, Jiang'an refused to use Xufu's "Circle Two Taiwan Yang," but it was accepted in Nanxi, 60 miles from Jiang'an, and Mutou Town, 30 miles from Jiang'an (under Jiang'an County). Other areas in northwestern Sichuan did not use it.</p>
<p>(3) Yunnan Full Dragon Double Dime: Can be used in counties near Yunnan, such as Xuyong, at five coins per silver dollar. Not used elsewhere.</p>
<p>(4) Yunnan Half Dragon Double Dime: Used in counties near Xuyong at a 75% discount, not used elsewhere.</p>
<p>(5) Yunnan Half Dragon One Dime: Used in counties near Xuyong at 700 copper coins per coin, not used elsewhere.</p>
<p>(6) Hong Kong Dragon Corner: Very few in quantity, only circulated near Gulan, at an 85% discount, not used elsewhere.</p>
<p>Half-yuan coins and double and single corner coins could not circulate in eastern Sichuan. Corner coins only circulated in southern Sichuan and have disappeared from northwestern Sichuan.</p>
<p>Paper Money</p>
<p>During the Xinhai Revolution, the Sichuan Provincial Treasury was looted by mutinous soldiers. After the establishment of the military government, due to a lack of funds, it issued a type of inconvertible paper money called "Military Currency." Later, it was over-issued, and its value plummeted, with each yuan only worth 20-30 cents. In 1915, the Sichuan government redeemed it at a set price. Subsequently, the Jun Chuan Yuan Bank was established on Shuwazi Street, designated by the Sichuan government as the Sichuan Treasury, and issued 2 million yuan in banknotes. Due to political changes, the bank went bankrupt, and its issued banknotes were also suspended. The Chongqing branch of the Bank of Communications issued banknotes, and the exchange coupons of the Yunnan China Bank simultaneously fell to 30-40% of their value. As a result, the Bank of Communications closed its Chongqing branch. It is said that the public suffered a loss of nearly 10 million yuan from the banknotes. In 1922, the Chongqing Dazhong Bank issued 500,000 yuan in banknotes, which were also affected by the Sichuan situation and soon ceased operations, with the banknotes gradually being redeemed by the bank. In 1923, Xiong Kewu established the Sichuan Bank and the Sichuan Official Silver House, issuing banknotes for military expenses, totaling 3.6 million yuan. During the war, the banknotes of these banks and silver houses ceased to be convertible due to political changes. In 1926, the Chengdu factory and miscellaneous goods movement expanded. The pawnshops established by the military, such as Yutong, Chengyi, and Hengyu, took the opportunity to issue licenses, with denominations of 1,000 yuan, 500 yuan, 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan. At that time, the public was tired of the chaotic silver coins, and the value of silver coins was difficult to use in the hands of unscrupulous merchants. The licenses did not distinguish between fineness and were easy to carry, so the public was willing to use them, and businesses were happy to accept them because it was not difficult to pay to the financial industry. However, speculators seized the opportunity. With just a few hundred yuan in printing costs, they could obtain thousands or hundreds of thousands of currency. With small capital and large profits, there were more than a hundred pawnshops issuing licenses in Chengdu. The public was confused by the fineness of silver coins and was willing to accept any license, regardless of whether the issuing pawnshop had sufficient capital. Later, the currency turmoil subsided, and the mint specialized in minting silver dollars and stopped minting 50-cent coins. These pawnshops, which had no funds and issued paper money indiscriminately, were afraid of redemption and quietly closed down and ran away. Here, I narrate a historical fact: A silk and satin shop on Chunxi Road in Chengdu received a 100-yuan license from a certain pawnshop. A few days later, the shop sent an apprentice to redeem the license at the address printed on the ticket. However, the apprentice found that the address was a public toilet. This situation occurred frequently, and the public's losses were estimated to be nearly 30 million yuan, most of which went into the pockets of the military and unscrupulous merchants. In 1923, a counterfeit bill craze occurred at the Chongqing Zhonghe Bank, with more than 2 million yuan in circulation. The bank redeemed them at a 70% discount. Last year, the 21st Army established a local bank and issued paper money. Its capital was less than 500,000 yuan, but the amount of paper money issued reached more than 30 million, breaking the record for the amount of paper money issued in Sichuan's history. The public feared that political changes would repeat the mistakes of the "Military Currency" and frequently staged bank runs. Therefore, the banks and pawnshops issuing paper money in Sichuan did not comply with the legal requirements to guarantee reserves and printed money arbitrarily. Here, I summarize the situation of the banks and pawnshops issuing paper money in Sichuan:</p>
<p>1. Bank of China: It is the oldest and largest bank in China. In Sichuan, it adopted a district-based issuance system. Branches in Chengdu, Chongqing, Neijiang, Fuling, and Wanxian all issued banknotes, which circulated in nearby counties. The denominations were 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan, with 1 yuan and 5 yuan being the most common. Because the bank had a good reputation and the most capital, the public trusted it very much. The 10-yuan banknote was ochre, the 5-yuan banknote was green, and the 1-yuan banknote was red, all printed with great care. However, because it was a district-based system, the Chongqing banknotes could be used at full value in Rongchang, but the banknotes issued in Neijiang were discounted to 97% in Rongchang, due to the different currency systems in different places. The Wanxian banknotes were discounted to 95% in Fengjie.</p>
<p>2. Mei Feng Bank: The bank was originally an American merchant affiliated with the Shanghai Mei Feng Bank and obtained the right to issue banknotes. The denominations were 10 yuan and 1 yuan, circulating in southeastern Sichuan. Currently, the Chongqing branch is entirely funded by Chinese merchants and renamed Chongqing Mei Feng Bank. The banknotes have strong paper, exquisite printing, and a good reputation. The 1-yuan banknotes circulate in various county villages, while the 10-yuan banknotes are mostly used in urban areas.</p>
<p>3. Sichuan Local Bank: The bank is a financial institution of the 21st Army. The founders were Gan Dian (now the Director of the Civil Affairs Department), the Director of the Political Affairs Department of the 21st Army, and Tang Hua (now the Salt Transport Envoy), the Director of the Finance Department. It was established in Chongqing on January 12, 1934. Liu Xiang, the Director of Sichuan Post-War Affairs, granted the bank the special privilege to issue paper money. The banknotes were printed by the First Printing Office of the Finance Department of the 21st Army, with poor printing quality and not in compliance with the prescribed banknote design. The amount of printing was not approved by the Ministry of Finance and was entirely controlled by the senior officers of the 21st Army, so they increased printing arbitrarily. It is said that the amount issued has reached more than 30 million, circulating in various counties in eastern, southern, and western Sichuan. The banknotes are divided into 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 1 yuan, and 50 cents, all in blue. Because the amount issued exceeded the capital by dozens of times, public confidence was weak, and accidents frequently occurred.</p>
<p>4. Sichuan-Kang Vocational Bank: Also a financial institution of the 21st Army. The general manager, Liu Hangchen, was recently appointed as the Director of the Finance Department. The bank is currently managed by Zhou Jiansan. It was established in Chongqing in 1930 and issued interest-free deposit certificates, which were a disguised form of banknotes, divided into 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan. The 10 yuan and 5 yuan were blue, and the 1 yuan was green. The 5 yuan and 1 yuan were more commonly used in the market, while the 10-yuan banknotes were slightly withdrawn. They circulate in various counties in eastern, southern, and western Sichuan, but the bank's banknotes in Zhongxian, eastern Sichuan, are used at a 90% discount.</p>
<p>5. Chongqing Bank: Formerly known as Chongqing Citizens Bank, renamed to its current name in August last year, issuing banknotes in denominations of 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 1 yuan, and 50 cents. The colors of the banknotes are ochre for 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan, red for 50 cents, and green for 10 cents, circulating in various counties in eastern, southern, and western Sichuan.</p>
<p>6. Chongqing Civilian Bank: The bank issues 50-cent children's gift certificates, similar to banknotes, in ochre color. However, they are easily damaged, and it is necessary to check whether the numbers at both ends match when receiving them, otherwise they are not easy to use.</p>
<p>7. Chongqing 21st Army General Treasury: Issues grain tax vouchers, divided into 500 yuan, 100 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 1 yuan, and 50 cents, circulating in the 21st Army's defense zone, rejected elsewhere.</p>
<p>8. Northwest Sichuan Bank: A financial institution of the 29th Army, issuing paper money in denominations of 50 yuan, 20 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 1 yuan, 50 cents, 20 cents, and 10 cents, circulating in the counties garrisoned by the 29th Army, but only used in areas near Santai (the military headquarters). They are paid at an 80% discount, and the use of them was stopped in Zhongjiang in October 1933.</p>
<p>9. Yasha Tax Bureau: The bureau is under the 24th Army and issues 1 yuan, 50 cents, and 20 cents silver vouchers, circulating in Rongjing and Yachuan, western Sichuan, used at a 90% discount.</p>
<p>10. Juxingcheng Bank: Issues 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan paper money, in small quantities, with a good reputation, circulating in Pengxian, Chongning, western Sichuan, and Gusong, southern Sichuan.</p>
<p>11. Chengyi Silver House: Funded by Chen Guodong, the former commander of the 7th Division of the Sichuan Army, issuing 20 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan banknotes, circulating in Chengdu and various counties in southern Sichuan.</p>
<p>In addition, there are pawnshops in Chengdu that issue licenses: Dong Sheng Company issues 10 yuan and 5 yuan licenses. Kangtai Xiang Silver House issues 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan licenses. Huichuan Silver House issues 20 yuan, 10 yuan, and 5 yuan licenses. Gongji Pawnshop issues 10 yuan and 5 yuan licenses. Xinyifeng issues 10 yuan, 5 yuan, and 1 yuan licenses. The capital of these pawnshops is mostly the private property of active military commanders, and the issued licenses only circulate in various parts of western Sichuan. This year, Deng Xihou of the 28th Army issued grain tax vouchers for use within his garrison area, issued by the army's General Treasury. Small pawnshops in various counties of Sichuan also issue paper money: Guanghan Gongtai Company issues 20 yuan, 10 yuan, 5 yuan, 1 yuan, and 50 cents banknotes. Liangshan Lizhi and Huasenmingyu Silver Houses issue 50 cents and 10 cents silver vouchers; six other silver houses in the county issue 10 cent paper money. The Finance Section of Dazu County issues Dazu circulation vouchers in two denominations: 1 yuan and 50 cents. Dianjiang has a Civilian Children's Savings Bank that issues 1 yuan vouchers. The silver vouchers issued by these companies can only circulate within the county area, and the paper money issued in Xiyang and Nanxi is not used.</p>
<p>Copper Coins</p>
<p>Speaking of copper coins, their chaos and complexity are consistent with silver coins. Before 1903, the auxiliary coins circulating in Sichuan were all cash coins. After 1903, one silver dollar could be exchanged for 700 to 800 copper coins, and the cost of living was very low. In 1915, the Chengdu Mint minted 50-cash bronze coins, and the value of silver coins gradually increased. In 1918-1919, due to the outbreak of war and the lack of copper sources, resulting in insufficient military pay, 100-cash copper coins were minted, and in 1920, 200-cash coins were added. At that time, one silver dollar could be exchanged for 2,300 to 2,400 copper coins. The mint was affiliated with the 28th Army and purchased old 50-cash and 100-cash copper coins to recast new 100-cash and 200-cash coins. The weight and size of the new 100-cash coins were the same as the 20-cash coins of the Qing Dynasty. The new 100-cash coin was only half the weight of the old 100-cash coin, and they naturally earned a lot of profit in one transaction. However, the public suffered because the coin price increased daily, but the actual value decreased. The price of silver coins increased daily, and in 1927, one yuan could be exchanged for 7,200 cash coins. In 1928, it increased to 9,600-9,700 cash coins to exchange for one silver dollar. At this time, military division and brigade commanders purchased cash coins and set up factories to mint copper coins: Yang Sen in Guang'an, Luo Zezhou in Shunqing, and Li Weiru, the brigade commander of Tian Songyao's unit, in Nanbu, all minted new 200-cash coins. They were manufactured manually, and the minting work was very perfunctory. Li Weiru's coins even contained yellow mud and charcoal slag, and they shattered at the slightest touch. These crudely made copper coins circulated in the market, and the price dropped daily. In 1930, one silver dollar could be exchanged for 15,000 cash. Recently, in Chengdu, each yuan has been exchanged for 28,800 cash, and in northern Sichuan, the quality of copper coins is even worse, and each yuan has been exchanged for 30,000 cash. The trend of cheap copper is truly alarming, and people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult. Our observation of the cause of the disastrous fall in Sichuan's copper coins is purely due to the decline in the value of the copper coins themselves, not caused by the high price of silver. This phenomenon can be proven by observing the following table, such as Hechuan:</p>
<p>One silver dollar exchanges for 26,000 new 200-cash copper coins</p>
<p>One silver dollar exchanges for 10,000 old 200-cash copper coins</p>
<p>One silver dollar exchanges for 8,000 old 100-cash copper coins</p>
<p>One silver dollar exchanges for 6,000 old 50-cash copper coins</p>
<p>One silver dollar exchanges for 4,000 old 20-cash or 10-cash copper coins</p>
<p>Also, in the county cities and markets of eastern Sichuan, only old 50-cash and old 100-cash copper coins circulate, and at most, one yuan can be exchanged for 10,000 cash. In places where new 200-cash copper coins are used, the public only uses them as 150 cash. One yuan can be exchanged for more than 10,000. If used as 100 cash, it will only be exchanged for about 10,000. But in places where they are actually used, you can't exchange one silver dollar for less than 26,000 or 27,000 cash. This further shows the decline in the value of copper coins themselves, forming the reason for the high price of silver.</p>
<p>Sichuan copper coins were minted by the Chengdu Mint with red copper, and the Chongqing Copper Yuan Bureau minted with bronze. Due to the difference in copper quality and the relationship of defense zones, there was a great difference in value. Even in the same county, there were differences in value between towns. For example, in Dazu County, the new 200-cash bronze coins were used practically inside and outside the city. The new 200-cash red copper coins were used as 150 cash each, and the old 200-cash coins were used as 250 cash. However, in Zhong'aochang and Gao Bi Chang, in the west of the county, 200-cash red copper coins were used practically, 200-cash bronze coins were used as 150 cash, and old 200-cash coins were completely rejected. In Longshui Town and Sanxi Chang, in the south of the county, new green and red copper 200-cash coins were not used. Transactions were mainly based on old 200-cash coins. In Dabao and Wangu Chang, etc., in the county, old 200-cash coins were commonly used, with each coin being used as 150 cash, the new 200-cash red copper coin was worth 100 cash, or not used, and bronze coins were not used. The chaotic situation in the same county, less than a hundred miles apart, can be seen. It is not difficult to know the situation of the currency system as a whole. Here, I describe the types of Sichuan copper coins as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Qing 10-cash copper coin: Because various minting agencies purchased them for melting and casting new 200-cash coins, they have disappeared from northwestern Sichuan. In Nanxi, southern Sichuan, each coin is worth 70 cash, Shiqi is worth 100 cash, and Xiyang is practical.</p>
<p>(2) Qing 20-cash copper coin: Very few in circulation. Each coin is worth 100 cash in various counties in northwestern Sichuan, 100 cash in Hanyuan, 70 cash in Nanxi, and Xiyang is practical.</p>
<p>(3) Sichuan-made 10-cash copper coin: Disappeared in various counties in western Sichuan. Ziyang and Lushan are worth 100 cash, Hanyuan is worth 50 cash, and Liangshan is worth 25 cash.</p>
<p>(4) Sichuan-made 20-cash copper coin: Very few in circulation. Chengdu is worth 200 cash, Hanyuan is worth 100 cash, and Ziyang is worth 50 cash.</p>
<p>(5) Sichuan-made 50-cash copper coin: Minted in the early years of the Republic, few in circulation. Chengdu is worth 200 cash, Yinlai is worth 150 cash, Nanxi is worth 140 cash, Liangshan is worth 125 cash, Kaijiang is worth 75 cash, but buying coal can be used as 150 cash, and Fengjie is practical.</p>
<p>(6) Old 100-cash coin: Minted by the Chengdu Mint in 1913. Chengdu is worth 200 cash, Kaijiang is worth 150 cash, Nanxi is worth 140 cash, Mabian is worth 130 cash, and Ren Shou, Kunlian, and Ziyang townships are worth 125 cash.</p>
<p>(7) Old 200-cash coin: Minted by the Chengdu Mint in 1918. Northern Sichuan is worth 300 cash, Liangshan and Meishan are worth 250 cash, Chengdu is practical, Kaijiang is worth 150 cash, and Nanxi and Xingwen are worth 140 cash. In Qixiang Jianwu Erzhen, in Xingwen County, it is worth 135 cash.</p>
<p>(8) New 100-cash coin: Minted by the Chengdu Mint and the Chongqing Bureau. Chengdu and Chongqing are practical, Nanxi is worth 70 cash, Xingwen and Xuyong are worth 50 cash, but Zhenxian is worth 62 cash, and eastern Sichuan and Youxiu Mopeng are not used.</p>
<p>(9) New 200-cash coin: Minted by the Chengdu Mint and the Chongqing Bureau. Chengdu and Chongqing are practical, Mabian is worth 150 cash, Xuyong is worth 100 cash, Nanxi is worth 70 cash, Zigong and Rongchang are not used, and eastern Sichuan is not used. But in Chenjia Township and Xiaoheba, in Nanchuan, it is worth 160 cash.</p>
<p>(10) Rou Copper Yuan: Privately minted, imitating the form of the Chengdu Mint, the coin mold is made of yellow mud, and it is manufactured manually, so the thickness of the coins is inconsistent, and the copper of the coins is not pure. It is called "Rou Copper Yuan" in the market, and it is difficult to use.</p>
<p>(11) Hammered 200-cash coin: Unscrupulous merchants heat the old 20-cash copper coin and hammer it into a mold. Some of the original patterns still exist, and the quality is very thin. Merchants often mix it into the 200-cash coins made by the factory to use.</p>
<p>(12) Copper Yuan Petals: Because there is a lack of auxiliary coins in the market, it is difficult to make change. In the Shunqing area, the old 100-cash coins are cut into two pieces, each piece is worth 50 cash, four pieces, each piece is worth 25 cash.</p>
<p>(13) Lead Coin: It was once circulated in Jiadingbenwei and other areas in two denominations: 20 cash and 10 cash. It was used for making change, but it has now disappeared.</p>
<p>Sichuan auxiliary coins are extremely scarce in the market, and the chambers of commerce of various counties have printed copper coin vouchers. The Xuyong Chamber of Commerce issued 50-cash and 25-cash copper coin vouchers. The Liangshan Chamber of Commerce issued 100-cash copper coin vouchers. The Gulan County Chamber of Commerce issued 50-cash copper coin vouchers, which were redeemed when they reached 100. The Gu Song Chamber of Commerce issued 50-cash copper coin vouchers, and the Finance Section of Kaijiang County issued 1,000 copper coin vouchers, 18,000 tickets, which were rejected by the people and were collected by the Finance Section. Suining Teahouse and Hotel used thick paper blocks as 100 cash. The Chengdu Mint minted a new type of 50-cash coin in 1926, which was slightly larger than a silver dime, but it did not circulate. In Gulan Shuinao Town, the copper coins minted in Yunnan in 1931 are worth 200 cash each and can only be used in that town.</p>
<p>During the Qing Dynasty, most of the cash coins were melted by merchants to make coins and utensils. It is said that some were used for making change. Since the Great Qing Cash Coins, each one is used as 20 cash, and each large red copper coin is used as 10 cash. Each large bronze coin in Xingwen is worth 5 cash. In Liangshan, one yuan can buy 140 taels of bronze coins and 150 taels of red copper coins. In some places, one yuan can only be exchanged for 120 taels of red copper coins. One catty of bronze coins in Fengjie is worth 700 cash, which is 70% of a coin. The large bronze coins in Guanxian are used as 50 cash each, and each large bronze cash coin in southern Sichuan is used as 20 cash. The "chicken eye money" and "extended ring money" made by the private kilns in Qing and Song are used as 10 cash each, as for the red copper coins, no one is willing to use them, because it is impossible to use them as 20 cash, and it is not worth it to use them as 10 cash. In Ren Shou County, each large bronze coin is used as 50 cash, and eight large red copper coins are required to make 100 cash.</p>
<p>The chaotic and complex currency system in Sichuan is entirely due to the military's disregard for national laws and regulations, and the people's livelihood and economy are suffering the most. The method of improvement is to strictly prohibit private minting to curb the source of the chaos; and then the mint purchases all illegal inferior coins and remints new coins. But we must pay attention to the objective environment in Sichuan and explore the psychology of the public's use of coins. According to the above description, the public uses a certain currency purely based on the amount of silver and copper it contains, and does not use the face value as the standard. Therefore, even if they are both silver coins, the value is very different, which is a clear fact in Sichuan. In addition, the banks and pawnshops that issue paper money often issue more than dozens of times more than their total capital and assets, and the guaranteed reserves cannot be fulfilled. If they unfortunately go bankrupt, these paper money are completely equal to waste paper. The paper money issued by the Jun Chuan Yuan Bank, Sichuan Bank, Sichuan Official Silver House, and the speculative banks and pawnshops in the 1926 currency turmoil are lessons from the past. The central government should first check whether the guarantee reserves of these banks are sufficient, otherwise, severe sanctions should be imposed to avoid unnecessary losses to the people. As for auxiliary coins, there should be a unified currency system. At present, the people of Sichuan feel extremely short of auxiliary coins, making transactions inconvenient, and the "Rou Copper Yuan" and "Hammered Copper Yuan" created by unscrupulous merchants are circulating in the market, destroying the organization of the social economy. It is reported that the central government has a motion to mint auxiliary coins, then the chaotic currency system in Sichuan may be unified, and the construction of Sichuan will be hopeful!</p>
<p>Finally, I have not studied the issue of currency. Here, I only summarize the public's opinions on improving the currency system. As for improving the strategy, it still needs to be planned by experts. This article is just a description of the outline of Sichuan's chaotic currency situation. Written in Shanghai on April 9, 1935.</p>
<p>Why is there still no solution to the people's food problem? Duan Sheng</p>
<p>The people's food problem, especially the rice problem, has gradually attracted attention in recent years, which is a gratifying phenomenon. However, the fact is that from 1930 to now, five years have passed, and there have been "bumper years of harvest", "cheap grain hurts farmers", "years of floods", "years of drought", but foreign rice (and wheat, but some are borrowed) has always been flooding in; instead, the previous wave has not receded, and the next wave is coming. Every year, the money flowing out is more than hundreds of millions. Recently, I received a letter from a friend who returned from a study tour in Southeast Asia, describing the construction of water conservancy and transportation in various colonies, as well as the development of agriculture. Even in times of economic downturn, there is still a custom of not picking up lost items on the road. In the end, he said with great emotion: "We call ourselves the descendants of the Yellow Emperor, and we can't help but shed tears when we look at each other." He also advised me to go to those places to study. I think that although all countries treat colonies the same way, like ants raising aphids, they also know that it is difficult to sustain by sucking blood and marrow, so they often give "the grace of rain and dew", so that aphids also have a chance to survive. France has built irrigation and drainage facilities in Annam to prevent floods and droughts, so no matter how the harvest is in China or how the rice price is, rice from Tokyo and Saigon can always be transported for sale. Japan's treatment of Taiwan and Korea is not the same as that of the French, so the rice from Taiwan and Korea can not only feed the Japanese, but also have surplus, and it is also transported to the old homeland for sale. Only we have been running schools for more than 50 years and reforming for 20-30 years, and we only see it retreat but not advance, and it is not just the people's food, but everything is the same. What is the reason for this? There is no need to say much. The biggest problem is still that we can talk but not act. The accumulated habits of writing articles for thousands of years have not changed. We can sit and talk but not act, and it is still the same. Despite talking about plans and submitting proposals, it is still of no help to the bankruptcy of rural areas and of no benefit to the people's food problem. Therefore, Chinese people are not as good as foreigners, only because they can talk but cannot do it practically. If they can talk and act, and act can get the results, then they can be said to have learned the strengths of others, not just imitating the surface.</p>
<p>The theory and plan of the people's food problem are the same as the revival of rural areas, which are the most fashionable problems now. Therefore, no matter who it is, in casual conversations, they have to talk about this a little bit; even those of us who live by writing, take this as a topic, no matter whether the article is good or bad, it is easiest to get the attention of readers. Because of this, the articles on the people's food are so thorough that experts and scholars have played them to the fullest and studied them thoroughly. The only difference is still the word "action". If we can do it step by step, we don't have to have one plan in the east and another in the west; if we don't do it, no matter how good the plan is, it is still just empty talk on paper.</p>
<p>In fact, the situation in China is too peculiar. Before June last year, wasn't it the rice-producing areas that were calling for "cheap grain hurts farmers"? But less than two months after the drought occurred, they were shouting the old tune of "famine situation", saying that there was a shortage of food and almost had to provide grain relief. Is it possible that the amount of food has increased greatly due to the drought, and the rice that was thought to be surplus a month or two ago has all been consumed? Isn't this an extremely contradictory joke? From last winter to this summer, there has been little rain, and everyone is worried about the drought, which is understandable. If there is another disaster this year, it will really be "no one left to eat". Fortunately, the monsoon season has arrived, dispelling this fear. After a few days of heavy rain, the places that were too dry last year are still scooping water to transplant seedlings; and in many places, there are already fears of floods, mountain floods, rivers rising, dikes being flooded, and houses being destroyed. In this situation, if it rains a few more days, some places will suffer from floods;</p>

<p>Special Telecommunications Edition The Voice of the Telecommunications Industry The Impact of Military Telephones on Telegraph Lines Hua</p>
<p>Please Military Authorities Prohibit This!</p>
<p>Recently, in various provinces, bandit suppression troops have often arbitrarily installed military telephones on telegraph lines in order to transmit military information. This has severely affected telegraph communications. Although the Ministry of Communications has repeatedly negotiated and the relevant authorities have strictly ordered a ban, the practice of installing military telephones has not diminished. In order to maintain the integrity of telecommunications and ensure that the country's nervous system is not hindered, we must offer a few words to the military authorities.</p>
<p>It is acknowledged that the victory of modern warfare depends on the rapid transmission of intelligence. We also understand that the bandit suppression troops, who defend the country and protect the people, are compelled by circumstances to use telegraph lines to transmit military information. However, all telegraph lines in the bandit suppression areas are generally very busy transmitting military reports. If all of them are occupied by military telephones, not only will internal and external news be completely cut off, but also political and military orders will not be able to be transmitted. For example, the Ba County-Guiyang line and the Hongjiang-Guiyang line were previously so heavily used for military telephone calls that political and military telegrams were blocked and could not be cleared. This not only hinders the entire telecommunications network, but also affects bandit suppression operations to some extent. This is the first point regarding communications that the military authorities should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Furthermore, all telegraph lines in our country are erected with iron wires and use the earth as a circuit. Therefore, the sound waves transmitted by using telephone sets are generally not very clear. In addition, the military often uses military telephones without restriction, installing them arbitrarily. As a result, there are often more than a dozen telephones connected to one line, causing severe interference and extreme chaos in the sound. In fact, it is questionable whether the military can effectively use such telephones to transmit military information. This is the second point from a technical perspective that the military authorities should pay attention to.</p>
<p>Since the impact of installing military telephones on telegraph lines is as described above, we appeal to the military authorities to cooperate in the following three aspects: (1) Unless absolutely necessary, strictly order subordinates not to arbitrarily install military telephones in order to avoid obstructing communications. (2) If it is absolutely necessary to use military telephones, please cooperate with the local telegraph office to set up the time for making phone calls and sending telegrams. (3) If telephone calls are frequent and a dedicated line is necessary, please order the communications team to erect a temporary military telephone line in order to avoid occupying the telegraph line and obstructing communications. If the relevant military authorities can support and implement the above three points, it will greatly benefit the future of bandit suppression.</p>
<h3>The Issue of Provincial Long-Distance Telephone Services Zhen</h3>
<p>According to the organizational law of the Ministry of Communications, telecommunications regulations, the resolution of the Third Executive Committee of the Kuomintang's Second Plenary Session in October of the 18th year regarding the administrative jurisdiction of administrative matters, the Executive Yuan's approval of the National Government's order in January of the 18th year regarding telephone services being uniformly managed by the Ministry of Communications, and the provisions of the Kuomintang's internal policy No. 1 regarding telegraphs and telephones being primarily managed by the Ministry of Communications, there has long been a legal basis for this. In recent years, provincial governments have often established their own long-distance telephone communications, even competing with state-owned telecommunications companies, resulting in a chaotic division of authority and frequent disputes. Since the Executive Yuan approved the "Principles of Entrusting Provincial Governments to Operate Long-Distance Telephone Services on Behalf of the Ministry of Communications" in July of the 22nd year, the Zhejiang Provincial Government signed a contract with the Ministry of Communications in July of the 23rd year to operate long-distance telephone services within Zhejiang Province on its behalf. Based on these principles, the issue of provincial long-distance telephone services has found a solution.</p>
<p>The aforementioned principles have three major premises: (1) Sovereignty issue: The Ministry of Communications entrusts provincial governments to operate long-distance telephone services on its behalf, which is the same as the Ministry of Communications entrusting railway stations of the Ministry of Railways and China Travel Service to operate telegrams, entrusting telegram and telephone agencies to operate telegrams and telephones, and inviting merchants to manage public telephones. Sovereignty must belong to the Ministry of Communications and cannot be ceded. However, it is acceptable to provide a percentage of the handling fee economically. This handling fee is deducted from the collected telegram and telephone fees, and no additional fees are charged to the senders and receivers of telegrams and telephone calls. It can be seen that what the Ministry of Communications values is sovereignty and convenience for the public, not competing for profits with the agents. (2) Business issue: The boundaries between telegrams and telephones must be clearly defined. Any written text transmitted electrically through metal wires or radio waves is a telegram. The transmitted language and sound is a telephone call. Agencies operating long-distance telephone services shall not concurrently operate telegram bureau stations where the Ministry of Communications has set up telegram bureau stations, or engage in disguised telegram services such as notifying telephone calls or requesting the transmission of telegrams. Conversely, if the Ministry of Communications has not set up a bureau station in a certain place, the long-distance telephone agency can sign a method with the Ministry of Communications to operate telegrams on its behalf. And the Ministry of Communications may, when necessary, use the agency's long-distance telephone lines to transmit telegrams concurrently. (3) Business scope issue: Inter-provincial calls or trunk line calls shall not be entrusted. If the provincial government has already connected calls, the Ministry of Communications may purchase them at a price and manage them directly, or the Ministry may temporarily rent its poles. The agency's long-distance telephone lines must avoid being set up in parallel with the Ministry's lines.</p>
<p>The three major premises are the principles within the principles of entrusting long-distance telephone services. It is said that the purpose of provincial governments establishing long-distance telephones is solely to facilitate communication and disseminate political orders, and not to make profits. This coincides with the purpose of the Ministry of Communications, so cooperation between them is a necessity in policy. If provincial governments do not cooperate with the Ministry of Communications and build independently, then even if the Ministry of Communications does not use its legal position to fight with the provincial governments, it will definitely seek business development from its own position. On the provincial government's side, even if it can be excused in law for disrupting the central administrative system, economically, what benefits can be said to exist under the competition between the two sides?</p>
<p>Foreigners ridicule China as "not a modern country" and "an unorganized country." Because it is not modern, it must be actively built. Because it is unorganized, it must unify political power. Only organization can build, and only unity can become a modern country. The efforts of provincial governments to build and establish long-distance telephones, in the spirit of modernization, are truly admirable. However, this construction must be under the guidance of the Ministry of Communications, so that unorganized actions can be avoided and consistent results can be achieved. Otherwise, each province will govern itself and not consult with each other, resulting in a waste of economic resources and talent, and the value of the business is predictable. In order to concentrate efforts to engage in construction projects, provincial governments that have not yet operated long-distance telephones should negotiate with the Ministry of Communications for unified management, and use their economic capabilities to engage in other construction projects. Those that have already operated should sign contracts with the Ministry of Communications to operate long-distance telephones on their behalf, closely cooperate with each other, and eliminate competition to help each other. If so, then our country's telecommunications industry must have considerable development. Provincial governments are not lacking in enlightened people, and they will certainly not let Zhejiang be the only one to excel in the past.</p>
<h3>Recent Major Events of International Radio Stations Di</h3>
<p>In recent years, the international wireless telegraph business has developed extremely rapidly, and its achievements are truly rare among emerging state-owned enterprises. The staff of the station, feeling the society's care, are even more motivated and dare not slack off in the slightest. At all times, they are striving to improve all facilities in order to repay the society's kindness and achieve the goal of complete autonomy in international telecommunications. Therefore, the staff of the station have always adhered to the spirit of "daily renewal and innovation" to carry out all tasks. The following is an excerpt of all the recent new matters of the station, for those who care about international wireless electricity:</p>
<p>Adding Transmitters to the Zhendru Transmitting Station The General Management Office and the Central Receiving and Transmitting Office of the International Radio Station are located in the Sassoon Building on Renji Road, in the center of the financial market of this port. The transmitting stations are located in Zhendru and Fenglin Bridge, with close contact between the two parties through remote control. Due to the station's thriving business and the large increase in external communication lines, the original equipment could not meet the application. A short-wave transmitter of 20 to 40 kilowatts was added from the United States. The station staff remodeled the equipment and the Ministry of Communications sent staff to inspect and accept it. It is now officially in use. As a result, the station's communication with Europe and the United States has become smoother and the efficiency has been greatly improved.</p>
<p>Expanding Special Line Receiving and Transmitting Commercial News Equipment In order to increase the speed of telegraph delivery for various commercial firms in this port, the station has set up a telephone special line exchange in the newsroom of the Central Receiving and Transmitting Office on Renji Road, Shanghai, so that major electric delivery machines or telephones can directly contact the station's newsroom, as if they were in the same room. The implementation of the express method of receiving and sending telegrams has been in place for several years, and merchants and the public have called it convenient. Recently, the station has received an increasing number of requests to install the special line. The original special line and machinery were insufficient, so it has been greatly expanded to meet the needs. It has recently been completed, and various requesting customers have been installed one after another, it is said.</p>
<p>Implementing Specialist Door-to-Door Telegram Pickup After the merger of postal and telecommunications agencies in this port, all post offices in the port can send international telegrams. Therefore, all Chinese and foreign people in this port can send international telegrams at nearby post offices. Recently, the station has implemented a specialist telegram pickup method for the convenience of senders. High-level receiving staff who are proficient in English and ride in motor vehicles are specially sent to various places in this port to collect the country. In the future, if Chinese and foreign merchants and gentry in this port need to send international telegrams but are inconvenient to send them to the general branch receiving and transmitting offices on Renji Road or at the intersection of Edward Road or to the receiving and transmitting offices of various post offices, they can notify the station's general receiving office by telephone (telephone number "11130", extension "19" or "20"). Staff will immediately be dispatched to drive a motor vehicle to pick it up and send it back to the station for immediate delivery. Cash or account telegrams are accepted. If it is a cash telegram, the staff will immediately calculate the telegram fee on the spot and issue a receipt. The situation is similar to customers notifying major companies to deliver goods by telephone. From now on, it will be more convenient for Chinese and foreign people in this port to send international telegrams.</p>
<p>Founding International and Domestic Wireless Telephones In order to seek telecommunications convenience between countries, the Ministry of Communications specially ordered the planning and establishment of domestic and foreign wireless telephones last year. After receiving the order, the station actively proceeded. All the equipment was shipped from the UK in March of this year and was rushed to be installed at the Zhendru Radio Station. The project is progressing very rapidly, and it is now basically installed, with only a small part still being rushed to be installed. It is expected that it will be completed within a few days. It is reported that trial calls with various countries have been scheduled to begin next month. As for contacting various countries to discuss call matters, the United Kingdom, the United States, Japan, and the Philippines are involved, and the prices will be handled in accordance with international regulations. If domestic provinces want to make calls with various countries, they will all be transferred through the Zhendru General Station. The transfer prices are currently being studied and drafted by the Ministry of Communications. Domestic wireless telephones will be available in Guangzhou, Hankou, and Shanghai. Currently, all three locations have installed telephone equipment, which is expected to be completed before the end of next month, and official calls can be made in early August. After the implementation results in the three locations are good, this domestic wireless telephone call price will be further expanded and is also being drafted by the Ministry of Communications.</p>
<h3>Discussing the Prohibition of Privately Established Radio Stations with Judicial and Public Security Organs You</h3>
<p>Privately established radio stations secretly communicate, which causes many harms. The most obvious are as follows: (1) Undermining the state-owned telecommunications industry; (2) Manipulating finance and disrupting the market; (3) Being used by reactionaries to transmit reactionary news or reactionary propaganda, which interferes with public security in small matters and endangers the party and the country in large matters. Therefore, the transportation authorities have always been extremely strict in banning private stations. In recent months, they have published announcements and offered rewards for whistleblowing in places such as Pingjin, Beijing, and Shanghai. As a result, many have been destroyed and have been investigated and dealt with one by one in accordance with the law. In the future, cunning people will definitely not dare to test the law with their own bodies. We would like to express our admiration and gratitude to the public security authorities everywhere for their practical assistance and to the judicial organs for their unwavering adherence to justice!</p>
<p>However, there is one thing that must be told to the public security and judicial organs everywhere. That is, the penalties for private stations should be distinguished according to the different types of equipment. The equipment can generally be divided into three categories: (1) Radios, which can only receive broadcast programs; (2) Receiving radios, which can listen to telegram symbols; (3) Transmitting and receiving radios, which can listen to telegram symbols and send telegrams. Therefore, the severity of law enforcement in handling these cases should be based on this. Although public security and judicial authorities are all well-versed in police regulations and familiar with laws, they may not be proficient in telecommunications technology. Therefore, these cases can be handled separately based on the statements of the telecommunications authorities. Generally speaking, the circumstances of not registering a radio are the lightest. The fault is a violation of Article 4 of the Telecommunications Regulations, and a fine of 5 yuan to 200 yuan should be imposed in accordance with the provisions of the second half of Article 21 of the Telecommunications Regulations, and the equipment should be confiscated to close the case. The circumstances of privately establishing a radio station that can listen to the radio waves and telegram symbols issued by public radio stations are more serious. According to the provisions of Article 340, Section 2 of the Criminal Law, "Electricity should be regarded as an object," it should constitute the crime of theft under the Criminal Law; the behavior of violating Article 3 of the Telecommunications Regulations should be fined 50 yuan to 2,000 yuan in accordance with the provisions of the first half of Article 21 of the regulations. After the public security organs seize these cases, they should be immediately transferred to the court for trial as theft and fined. The telecommunications bureau should also investigate the extent of the damage and file a civil lawsuit to recover the losses. Those with both transmitting and receiving radios have serious circumstances and should be severely punished. The following is an excerpt of the sentencing of the Tianjin Court in handling these cases in the past for reference:</p>
<p>Case Judgment</p>
<p>Jin Taizhi Privately Established a Receiving Radio Imprisonment for two years for the public prosecution part.</p>
<p>Compensation for telephone losses of 4,200 yuan for the private prosecution part.</p>
<p>Yongli and other silver companies privately established transmitting and receiving radios In the public prosecution part, the relevant persons were sentenced to imprisonment ranging from three years to six months and deprivation of public rights.</p>
<p>In the private prosecution part, the two parties reached a settlement, and Yongli Silver Company compensated the Telecommunications Bureau 17,000 yuan.</p>
<p>Since the harm of privately established radio stations is not tolerated by law, the telecommunications authorities are duty-bound to strictly investigate and crack down on them, and the public security and judicial organs are also bound by duty to assist in the event of an incident. It is hoped that in the future, the public security, judicial, and telecommunications organs in various places will continue to maintain the spirit of close cooperation in the past and work harder in order to thoroughly eliminate private stations, which is not only a blessing for telecommunications administration, but also a blessing for the country and society!</p>
<h3>Talking About the Prepaid Reply Fee Method Zhongxian</h3>
<p>A prepaid reply telegram is a type of special telegram. If the sender wants the receiver to send a reply telegram and is willing to prepay the reply telegram fee, they can estimate the amount of telegram fee required for the reply telegram when sending the telegram, pay it to the sending office, and add a (Reply...) or (RP...) (the number of prepaid reply telegram fees is filled in by the telegraph office in the dotted line position) fee mark to the province of the telegram (this mark is charged according to one word). When the receiving office receives this telegram, it shall immediately fill out a prepaid reply fee voucher according to the prepaid reply fee amount listed in the telegram and send it to the receiver along with the incoming telegram. Whoever uses this voucher to send a reply telegram within three months from the date of issuance of the voucher may use the prepaid reply fee amount opened by the sender in the voucher to offset the telegram fee. If the amount of telegram fee payable for the reply telegram exceeds the prepaid reply fee amount listed in the voucher, the insufficient amount may be supplemented by the sender using the voucher. Conversely, if there is a surplus after deducting the reply telegram's payable telegram fee, the original sender may apply to the original sending office for a refund of the remaining amount within six months from the date of issuance of the voucher. In other words, the prepaid reply fee amount opened in the voucher has the same value as cash. However, according to regulations, the remaining reply fee amount for domestic telegrams is less than four jiao of silver dollars, or the remaining amount for international telegrams is less than two gold francs, and cannot be refunded. If the receiver receives this voucher and does not conveniently use the voucher to send a telegram within three months, they can send the voucher to the local telegraph office and request that the original sender be notified to refund the prepaid reply fee to the sender, or send the voucher back to the sender, who can directly apply to the sending office for a refund.</p>
<p>According to the provisions of Article 56, Section 2 of the International Telegraph Regulations: "When a telegram arrives at the receiving location, the delivering office shall fill out a voucher according to the amount of prepaid fee stated in the original telegram and send it to the receiver. This voucher shall be allowed to be used within the value of the voucher by any office under the jurisdiction of the competent authority that issued the voucher to send a telegram, regardless of whether it has special business, to any receiving location; or by the wireless radio station that issued the voucher to send a wireless telegram to a mobile station." Its meaning is that anyone holding a prepaid reply fee voucher can use the voucher to send a telegram to any receiving location to offset the telegram fee at the local telegraph office or wireless radio station and its branch receiving and transmitting offices, or bring the voucher to a location with a telegraph bureau station of the Ministry of Communications to send a telegram, and it is not necessary to be limited to sending a reply telegram. This regulation is quite convenient for people holding reply fee vouchers.</p>
<p>In addition, if various commercial firms or manufacturers have a large number of seasonal goods arriving or have excellent products, they can use the prepaid reply fee method to send telegrams to commercial firms everywhere to promote them in order to attract customers. After receiving telegrams with prepaid reply fee vouchers, commercial firms everywhere will naturally be happy to reply by telegram to purchase. Therefore, the effect of this prepaid reply fee method on attracting business is not shallow.</p>
<p>Secondly, if the sender requests to cancel a telegram that has already been sent, or inquires whether the telegram has been delivered properly, and the receiver inquires about the sender's name or address, etc., and requires the telegraph office to send a fee-paying official telegram (this official telegram is charged according to only six words) and wants the other telegraph office to reply by telegram, they can also use the prepaid reply fee method to prepay the six-word reply telegram fee to the telegraph office so that the other telegraph office can reply by telegram to what was inquired. All incoming and outgoing telegrams only need to pay a telegram fee of twelve words. It is more economical than sending an inquiry telegram yourself. In the future, senders and receivers, if they encounter the above inquiry matters, can use the prepaid reply fee method to send fee-paying official telegrams to save money. It can be seen that the prepaid reply fee method is indeed extremely beneficial to the public.</p>
<h3>A Tentative Review of the Newly Revised Business Regulations for Municipal Telephones of the Ministry of Communications Reporter</h3>
<p>Seven Points Beneficial to the Public Implemented Since July 1 of This Year</p>
<p>The business regulations for municipal telephones have a great relationship with the progress of the business of a bureau and the interests of the public. The various telephone bureaus directly under the Ministry of Communications have each formulated their own business regulations and implemented them with the approval of the Ministry of Communications. The methods are varied and the content is simple, and they need to be properly regulated to unify them. However, the economic conditions of various places are different, and the equipment of each bureau is not the same. It is necessary to include local flexibility in the unified method. The Ministry of Communications first conducted a detailed study of the current regulations of each bureau, and then, based on the current system of each bureau, took into account the local conditions of each bureau, and drew on the regulations of various European and American countries to formulate the "Business Regulations for Municipal Telephones of the Ministry of Communications," which were promulgated on June 21 and implemented from today. In the future, the various telephone bureaus will have the highest principles to comply with, and the interests of the public in various places will also be protected by law according to these regulations. The former is a business issue for the telephone bureau, and there is no need to say more. The latter is an issue of public interest, and people in society need to pay close attention to it. The following are the benefits of these regulations to the public compared to the old regulations:</p>
<p>(1) In the past, the business regulations formulated by each bureau often focused on the bureau's side and neglected the rights that the users should have. For example, when installing a machine, the user was only limited to paying the fee to the bureau within a certain number of days, but there was no regulation on how many days the bureau should install the machine after paying the fee. This method is similar to a unilateral contract. These regulations take into account both parties and avoid the abuse of giving too much weight to one side.</p>
<p>(2) Users of each bureau who rent telephones, except for the Tianjin and Wuxian bureaus, which stipulate that a contract must be signed as a basis for proof, all other bureaus do not have a contract to rely on. These regulations stipulate a "Telephone Equipment Rental Contract." Users who install telephones must fill out this contract, and both parties sign and seal it and each hold a copy, so that there is a legal basis.</p>
<p>(3) In large cities in various countries with more telephone users, the call fee is mostly charged by the number of calls to limit calls and the fee is the fairest. Otherwise, if there are many users and the number of calls is unlimited, it is very easy to cause excessive calls. As a result, the bureau's consumption will inevitably increase. Conversely, if the user's number of calls is small, they must still pay the same monthly rental fee as users with a larger number of calls, which is not a fair thing. Therefore, these regulations stipulate not only a monthly package system but also a number system.</p>
<p>(4) Various bureaus charge a large amount for users to change their names or transfer ownership. In order to avoid paying this fee, users often privately transfer ownership and do not go to the bureau to go through the formalities, resulting in a mismatch between the user's real name and the name listed in the directory. Calling numbers often causes errors, which is not only a waste of machine usage but also easily causes user complaints. These regulations change the transfer of ownership and name changes to be free of charge in order to encourage users to voluntarily come to the bureau to change their names or transfer ownership. The abuse of hiding and not changing names can be avoided. The Ministry of Communications has a considerable loss in this name change fee every year, but it is still worth it for the convenience of the public.</p>
<p>(5) If the fee for moving a machine outside the house is lower than the installation fee, it is easy to lead to tricks. Therefore, these regulations reduce the installation fee on the one hand and stipulate that the outside-the-house moving fee is equal to the installation fee on the other hand to prevent abuses.</p>
<p>(6) Users who privately install machines shall be punished and the machines shall be confiscated in accordance with the provisions of Article 21 of the Telecommunications Regulations. However, the right belongs to the courts, and the bureaus can request the courts to handle the matter in accordance with the law in order to comply with the law.</p>
<p>(7) The price of the fee cannot be unified due to the different conditions in various places, and each department must still submit it for approval by the Ministry of Communications for implementation, so that there is room for flexibility.</p>
<p>The above-mentioned points are all beneficial to the public. As for defining the basic whole business area as the scope of exclusive operation of municipal telephones and stipulating various types of business to provide users with various conveniences, these are all the characteristics of these regulations.</p>
<h3>The Tasks of the Three Types of Inspections in the Telegraph Bureau Stations Shen Yuanhong</h3>
<p>(1) Business Inspection Business inspection is a type of external staff member who is directly under the jurisdiction of the business director. Because they are responsible for promoting business and expounding the effectiveness of telegrams, the various telegraph bureau stations are very careful in selecting this type of talent. Only those with high moral character, eloquence, proficiency in business, and familiarity with business conditions are appointed. Their main tasks are: A. Promote business B. Check telegram delays C. Publicize telegram knowledge D. Probe public opinion E. Explain the bureau station's service spirit</p>
<p>(2) News Service Inspection News service inspection is a type of setting in the newsroom of the telegraph bureau station, so those who check and correct the delay of news items, their duties are as follows: A. Proofreading of symbol paper strips B. Remedying errors C. Investigating the delay of news items D. Correcting the misdirected or missed news items</p>
<p>(3) Messenger Inspection Messenger inspection is nothing less than a class leader among messengers, mostly promoted from among the experienced messengers. Their duties are four: A. Timing of telegram delivery B. Investigating telegram misdelivery or missed delivery C. Remedying undeliverable telegrams D. Leading the messenger shift or off-shift matters</p>
<p>The above three types of inspections have been adopted and implemented by our country's telecommunications authorities. Since then, telegram receiving and sending have been able to be swift and there have been no errors. This is truly a manifestation of the commercialization of telegraph bureau stations.</p>
<h3>My Impression of the Telegraph Bureau Su Linqi</h3>
<p>This article is a letter from Mr. Su to our newspaper, based on his current impression of the telegraph bureau, using facts to prove what he wants to say in his heart, without any boasting. This publication is happy to publish it, enough to measure the psychology of ordinary senders.</p>
<p>Editor's Note</p>
<p>Recently, the transportation authorities' earnest reforms to the directly administered telecommunications agencies and the stipulation of various methods to facilitate the people are very noteworthy.</p>
<p>In advanced European and American countries, the telegraph industry is very developed. Citizens do not need to write letters all year round and use telegrams instead of letters. Looking at the streets and avenues, there are many red slogans such as "Don't Write! By Telegram!" which are dazzling, which can be seen.</p>
<p>In our country, it is not so! In the past, it was really a big trouble for ordinary people to send a telegram. First of all, they had to run a long way to the telegraph bureau, and that telegraph bureau made people feel different. Walking into a broken building, there were a few dim electric lights inside, so dark that it was almost impossible to write. Most of the receiving clerks were a few old gentlemen who were about to die. Suffering from nearsightedness and heavy hearing loss, this was enough to cause entanglement. Holding a water pipe in his hand, and the rest.</p>
<p>Now, it is indeed different from the past! The telegraph bureau has greatly brightened, and the staff are all energetic and full of energy, which is very different from the past! What makes people feel even more satisfied and convenient is that postal branches everywhere can send and receive telegrams on the spot, and the receiving clerks are mostly experienced, polite, and amiable. In the answers, all are enough to make the senders get a good impression.</p>
<p>Now let me tell you my personal impression: I remember once I came out of the Cathay Theater on Xiafei Road in Shanghai after watching a movie, and ran to the Gansheng branch opposite to send a telegram to Guangzhou. The telegram fee was only one yuan. I gave five yuan to find change. At that time, because a friend was still waiting at the entrance of the theater, I forgot to take the change and ran away. Later, we had already walked to the intersection of Albert Road, but the telegraph receiving gentleman hurriedly chased after us from behind, holding four one-yuan tickets in his hand to return to me. At that time, I only thanked him, and I didn't even know the gentleman's name.</p>
<p>Also, my relative, Miss Situ, is a student at the business school. She also sent a telegram in the hand of that gentleman and accidentally dropped a handkerchief. This gentleman sent someone to seal the handkerchief in an envelope and return it to her that day, which made her happy. Although a small handkerchief is not worth a few mao.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, government agencies are not as good as commercial agencies. The clerks inside are mostly relatively arrogant and tyrannical because they have the identity of civil servants. (Of course, there are exceptions, that is another matter.) The telegram receiving gentleman at the Xiafei Road Telegraph Bureau is indeed worthy of our respect! It also shows the spirit of the staff of the current telegraph bureau!</p>

<h3>Mini Biographies of World Telecommunications Inventors Jian</h3>
<p>Fifteen · Sir Oliver Lodge</p>
<p>Lodge was a British physicist and radio inventor. Born in Pankhurst in 1851, he entered the Newberry Grammar School at the age of eight, and helped his father run a business at the age of fourteen. He studied at the University of London at night and obtained the highest honors in scientific physics tests. In 1872, he entered the University of London as a full-time student. In 1877, he obtained a doctorate in electricity and then served as a lecturer and associate professor of physics at the university. In 1881, he was appointed as the first professor of physics at the University of Liverpool. In 1887, he was a member of the Royal Society, and the following year he obtained the L.L.D honorary degree from St. Andrews University. He was the first person to be awarded this honor. In 1900, he was appointed as the first president of the University of Birmingham, a position he held for nearly 20 years. In 1902, he was knighted. Lodge was one of the most famous physicists of his time. He devoted himself to the study of electrical phenomena and contributed greatly to all parts of electrical engineering. Lodge also made many contributions to radio, because he was particularly clear about certain principles of electromagnetic radiation. He then studied the surge swing of discharge on the wires, which is the best method of lightning protection. The Lodge resonance bottle is one of the most amazing experiments, and it has recently been adopted as a device for measuring wavelength. Lodge once experimented with Hertz's invention of electromagnetic waves in 1888. He had long known the greatness and importance of his theory. Later, he confirmed Clerk Maxwell's theory. He devoted his life to research and eventually became a great British physicist of his time. His great invention of the world was a mentor to Marconi and other scientists. Lodge invented the sticky debris detector to transmit radio telegrams. He also used it to test signal transmission at a distance of hundreds of yards. In 1897, he made a tuned wavelength meter, which was registered as a patent. It was adopted by the Marconi Company in 1911. Lodge also made many contributions to other sciences. Such as the theory and experiment on Ita, especially the author. Lodge also made many interesting studies on the transmission of electricity in liquids. Lodge was the first to test the direction and speed of molecular flow when salt solutions were electrolyzed by a simple method. Later, he studied the path of electric waves and light rays through moving media and won the Runford Medal, the highest honor of the Royal Society, in 1898. Lodge was praised by the world for explaining the difficult problems and basic principles of physics in a clear and concise manner.</p>

<p>Supplementary Edition of the Shen Bao in This Port Talking about the President's Son Supporting Himself Chen</p>
<p>The 27th newspaper reported that the youngest son of the American president, John, obtained a position in the Tennessee Valley Construction and will go to work this summer, supporting himself. It also added the annotation: "It is also thought-provoking for the president's son to learn to support himself." In our country, where "ancestral blessings" are prevalent and sons of wealthy families are flaunted, the meaning of this "thought-provoking" is worth discussing.</p>
<p>There is a famous saying in our country in the past, "Descendants will have their own blessings, don't be a beast of burden for your descendants," and it is also said, "Accumulating virtue is better than accumulating wealth." This teaching enlightens people to train their children and grandchildren, and should focus on self-reliance, and never diligently and exclusively save "sinful money," which instead creates countless evils for children and grandchildren. At the same time, it can also warn many sons of wealthy families that if they rely on ancestral property for a living, they will easily tend to extravagance and licentiousness, and eventually fall into decline and ruin, leading to the destruction of their families.</p>
<p>However, many misers throughout history have accumulated millions of assets to leave to future generations, thus creating countless tragedies of "harming with love," which can almost be described as countless. This may be because the familism prevalent in our country is the reason. The father is only afraid that the search is not exhaustive, and the son is afraid that the extravagance is slightly behind. As a result, there are those who ruin their families and go bankrupt, those who lose their reputations, and those who sue each other in court, or even kill each other. There are many origins of these family ugly histories and tragedies arising from other accidents, but the root cause is that family property is the most important driving force.</p>
<p>"You reap what you sow." The evolution of this sin is originally self-inflicted and deserved. We don't need to pity them here. However, the social malpractices formed by this phenomenon cannot but be severely criticized. (1) Parents who generally want to benefit their children and grandchildren, since they are committed to accumulating property to leave to their children, then in addition to cultivating their children's rare weakness, incompetence, pride, extravagance and licentiousness, they themselves cannot but fall into a malignant nature! That is, on the one hand, they become relentless bloodsuckers, and on the other hand, they develop a miserly attitude towards social welfare, "I would not do it even if it would benefit the world by pulling out a hair." (2) Since the sons of wealthy families who own huge sums of money do not have to worry about food and clothing, "when full and warm, they think of lewd pleasures," they will inevitably expose their wandering nature. The "modern" young masters who hang out in cinemas, dance halls, and hotels all day long are mostly of this kind. As a result, a morbid extravagance prevails in society.</p>
<p>These two phenomena are mutually causal, and the resulting tragedies almost fill the "yellow news" in the newspapers. Although its elimination is a fundamental social problem, we may as well use the "self-reliance" of Roosevelt's sons to expose the sins of these sons of wealthy families.</p>
<h3>"Nora" Fang Zhizhong</h3>
<p>(1) Ibsen and "Nora"</p>
<p>Henrik Ibsen, famous in the world of literature for his "problem play," "Nora" is one of his masterpieces. He developed a sharp disgust for the society of the time with "I am a guest who was rejected by the sumptuous banquet of life," and the aftermath of the French Revolution shook his heartstrings, so he raised the banner of resisting the ugly society. He was a world-weary pessimist (Pessimism Of Lndi ), although he hated the ugly side, he did not fall into the quagmire of escapism, and what he indulged in his thinking was an ideal that was sure to be realized. At the same time, he was an extreme individualist, and "morality" and "reputation" were both rendered in his thinking, which is a clear proof in "Nora" of Durmore and Croeker.</p>
<p>"Nora" is a work of the 1879s, containing multifaceted problems of life. Since the play was first performed in his native country, it has filled the women of all Scandinavia with "Nora's" declaration of independence. Not only that, but the European and American societies rushed into the</p>
