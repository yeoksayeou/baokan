<h3 id="c51">新生活運動創始一週紀念 <a href="#c51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>— 年</p>
<p>自去年此日。蔣委員長在南昌行榮擴大紀念週講演。提倡新生活運勤以來。迄今一週年矣。此以復興民族爲目標。以提高國民知識道德爲進行基礎之新生活運動。經一年間之風動全國。其滋長發展達如何之程度。實今日國人所首應注意者也。</p>
<p>本報年鑑。爲欲使國人明瞭一年來新生活運動進行之經過起見。曾特約對此極有研究之張君小通。作一綍核之紀載。茲節錄其要點如次。（一）自南昌方面創始以來。在蔣委員長領導下繼起進行者。有首都上海北平各大市及蘇冀鄂閩皖豫浙湘魯晉陜甘察綏寗青川黔滇康等二十一省區。夫全國省區二十八。東北四省在淪陷中。新疆有隔絕之勢。是除兩廣。此新生活革命之運動。已有普及之成績矣。（二）去年七月起。全國新生活運動。由促進會之推動。改爲受總會之指導。不特步驟齊一。其工作亦由宣傳而進於實際行動。（三）新生活運動之初步。須做到整齊清潔簡單樸素迅速確實等六項。至二十三年終「規矩」「清潔」之初步時期已告一段落。而入於進一步之生活軍事化生產化藝術化時期。</p>
<p>綜上以觀。一年間新生活運動之成績。斑斑可見。次更就其內容一檢討之。在「新生活運動綱要」中有對此之解釋曰。</p>
<p>新生活運動。就是提倡「禮義廉恥的規律生活。」以禮義廉恥之素行。習之於日常生活——衣食住行四事之中。禮義廉恥者。乃發揚民德以成民事。爲待人處事持躬接物之中心規律。</p>

<p>今日在東歐如允許德國之自由行動、則明日德國將允許其自身得在西歐自由行動、如此小恊約國絕無安全保障、此點即爲法國在歐洲大陸之地位將大爲削弱、同時假如德國向捷克進攻、而法國以同盟條約關係將援助捷克、如此則照脫離倫敦恊定原意之天空公約而言、英國將向法國進攻、是故英國當局對於東歐公約之攻擊、亦即對於法國之攻擊也、德國覆文另有一種目的、此即消除法國對其同盟國及友國之信用是也、柏林發時草擬該項覆文之際、聲稱其覆文要旨與英國希望相合、同時願與英國合作、令法國脫離目前之地位、且令其削弱、如倫敦提案之精神果如德國覆文所期、則其對於和平之打擊至重且大、德法英三國之天空公約、決不能戒備戰爭、反之、彼且創造戰爭危機、並令其加強數倍、此無他、彼對德國帝國主義者授予自由行動之權也、英國當道正以維持和平之假貌、鞏固和平敵人之地位、故維持歐洲和平之全責、應由英國當局負之」云、（十七塔斯電）</p>

<p>— 李廷安</p>
<p>蔣委員長提倡新生活運動，其目的乃在復興民族，其動力乃在全體民衆，其方法乃以清潔爲首要。良以欲復興民族必須全體民衆參加運動，而全體民衆所能貢獻於國家之主要條件，厥唯其健全之體格，而健全體格之養成，宣自初步開始，即自注意清潔著手，故蔣委員長所提倡之新生活運動，其一貫之原則爲務本慎始，而此務本慎始之鏈之主要一項，乃唯培養民族健康。</p>
<p>健康之道至多，而技術上之方法，更非簡單，例如營養問題，鄧防疾病，檢查體格，早期診斷，以及體育訓練等等無不與個人之身心健康有密切之關係，其方法上之研究，要皆爲技術上之問題，然而欲訓練全體民衆，以齊整之步調走向民族健康之域，決不能蔑視先後綏急之順序，以致冠履倒置，欲速而不達，由是不得不分別輕重，以最基本，最與民衆日常生活有關之點作爲訓練之出發，所謂清潔是也，蓋新生活運動之主要一環既爲民族健康，而此新生活運動一鏈中之民族健康之環，不同於普通之健康問題，必須爲其貫穿整個運動之基本原則所聯擊，換言之，新生活運動之任何一項，必須從小做起，逐步進行，其健康方面之訓練，不務高唱入雲之空談，而重著地築起之礎石，宜乎無知者之不明其底蘊而反䛆笑爲淺近。殊不知一般人所䛆笑之淺近，乃適爲新生活運動精神之偉大。</p>
<p>夫清潔之於人生，誠有莫大之關係，例如勤於沐浴，可以使全身血液時常暢流，而我人之食物經胃腸消化後，能吸收者由淋巴管輸入血液，運送至身體各部組織，經氧化後，以供生活之需要，即在其起氧化作用之時，產生各植有毒廢物。其主要者爲炭酸尿毒尿酸等，炭酸氣山肺排出體外，尿素尿酸，滲以水份由泌尿器排出，或經汗管排出皮膚，日久之後，水份雖能蒸發，而汗垢（如尿素及各種鹽基類），多積存於管口，如不勤爲洗除，易將管口閉塞，失去排匯廢物及調節體溫之功能，因易致病，者能勤於沐浴，此種弊害，即可除去，故新生活公約曰：「常常洗澡」。又如飯前及大便後，必須洗手，粗視之，似屬小事，不知人手時與外物接觸，易帶有各種病菌，如不洗手進食即有將手上病菌帶入口中之可能。而吾人糞便中亦常帶有病菌，大便後如洗手，即可將病菌重行帶入口中。故新生活公約曰：「要常洗手」。又如牙齒之清潔？最爲重要，如食物聚藏齒縫內腐爛後，不獨齒黃口嗅，且可毀壞質，釀成牙病，如患牙病或齒根腐爛生菌，則菌毒入胃釀成胃病爲害甚巨「」故新生活公約曰：「食後一定漱口，早晨一定刷牙齒」又如呼吸器之病如傷風肺癆等皆由口鼻之排洩物如細霧噴出，他人吸之，即可受染致病。如能於嚏咳時背人而立。並以手巾掩蓋口鼻，則排匯物不致飛揚空隊，故新生活公約曰：「身邊一定帶手帕」。約舉數例，可見雖皆爲極細微之事項，而莫不與個人公衆之健康，有莫大之關係，並可見此種雖屬微細之習慣，凡我國民衆確猶未能普遍養成，尚有待於提倡，茲再將新生活公約共一百十九條中有關健康之四十四條列下，以見新生活與健康之密切關聯。</p>
<p>（一）食的方面共九條</p>
<p>不吸煙；不酗酒；不吃零食；早起多喝幾杯開水；物不潔不食；水不沸不喝；食後一定嗽口，早晨一定刷牙齒；食前食後不作劇烈的運動；㕑房及碗筷等力求清潔。</p>
<p>（二）衣的方面共二條</p>
<p>衣服要整齊樸素清潔，身邊一定帶手帕。</p>
<p>（三）住的方面共二十三條</p>
<p>房屋要整潔，牆壁勿塗污，傢具要簡潔，癠窗要常啓，要早起早睡，要漱口洗頭並常洗手，要吸新鮮空氣，每天要有一種適宜的運動，指甲要常洗「，常常洗潥，被褥要常曬常洗，小孩應注意清潔，屋中要常常打掃，溝渠要常常疏通，桌椅要清潔，廁所要乾浄，蚊子要撲滅，蒼蠅要撲滅，老鼠要捕殺，不要隨處吐痰，不要隨地便溺，垃圾倒在垃圾桶中，家家要每天打掃門口街道。」</p>
<p>（四）行的方面一條。</p>
<p>不可隨地小便。</p>
<p>（五）如樂方面共三條</p>
<p>不嫖，不和舞女跳舞，不看淫書淫畫，選做一種正當如樂。</p>

<p>總理孫先生畢生精力盡瘁於斯、用是遂能鼓動風氣、造成時勢、以富貴不能淫、貧賤不能移、感武不能屈之大無畏精神、領導全中華民族之聲士、凝成不可抵禦的力量、卒能將滿清之萬惡的封建制推翻、</p>

<p>領袖蔣委員長、在革命運動之艱苦奮門中、得到無數的實際經騐、體認到是全部遣敎、能早日見之關行、是必須先有一種廣大的、普遍的國民運動、使人人都可以參加、人人都可做得到、人人都有利益。</p>

<p>（二）新生活運動、至今一週年了、我們回顧這一年來、新生活運動的工作、得到無限的歡欣與興奮、自從領袖在江西提倡新生活運動、標舉禮義廉恥四十端、希望全體國民、本此要義、在衣食住行實際生活中、表現其整齊·清潔·簡單·樸素·速速·確實·以轉移風氣、復興民族、挽救危亡、一年以來、全國聞風景從、樹爲楷模、首先從南昌做起、成績之佳、爲全國之冠、市容之整齊、秩序之有條不紊、市民之清潔、在在都使人望而生敬、至於黨政軍警學工農商各界領袖、俱能推誠合作、促進新生活運動、並得到領袖親身指導、全南昌人士、俱受領袖偉大精神之感召、皆心悅誠服、服從領袖之指導、故南昌能得此優良的成績者、誠非偶然的事情、此其一、</p>
<p>再說到漢·北平·洛陽·首都·各大城市、亦俱能按照領袖的「新生活運動綱要」、與「新生活須知」的規定、次第推行、曾組織新生活勁導隊、一方面自已實行新生活、另一方面積極勸導市民實行新生活、並規定遵守公共秩序及公共衛生各事項、認真推行、實施整齊清潔總檢查、成績極有可觀、至於憲警會訂實行新生活辦法、恊同勤導施行、此舉尤爲特色、</p>
<p>最後說到上海了、上海的新生活運動、非常積極、吳市長及各界領袖、本著領袖的新生活運動要旨、認真努力推行、兄弟接長公安局以來、幸得參加新生活運動工作、追隨吳市長及各界領袖之後、在本局與個人職責所在的地方、絕不敢放棄責任、故在接任之初、即按照新生活的規定、先從本局切實施行、舉凡日常辦公以及各職員的私人生活、俱要求適合禮義廉恥、並要表現出整齊·清潔·簡單·樸素·迅速·確實·現在正在積極督促推行中、其他如會同衛局舉行全市清潔總檢查、整頓市容等、有關於新生活的工作、亦曾經積極不斷的推行、尚望各界領袖和全體市民、嚴厲督促、俾新生活運動、得有長足之進步、則厚幸矣、</p>
<p>我們回顧一年來之新生活動的工作、結果非常良好、自領袖提倡以來、全國各界的領袖以及團體、已經聞風興起了、廣大的風氣、已經樹立、一切楷模、亦逐漸俱備、民族復興、兆基於此了、</p>
<p>（三）我們展望新生活運動的前途、覺得有無限的良好景象、茲將本人從今以後、擬按照領袖所規定的「新生活運動綱要」·和「新生活須知」·以及新生活運動總會·與上海市新生活運動促進會所規定的各事項、會同有關係各界切實舉辦外、其辦理各事、分述如下、</p>
<p>第一、擬督促本局全體職員警士、在公私生活中、俱要按照新生活的規定、切實執行、如衣食住行、必須合乎禮義廉恥的規定、時時刻刻、要表現出整齊·清潔·簡單·樸素·迅速·確實·並擬隨時舉行檢查、隨時舉行考核、隨時舉行勸導、須使全體員警、一律做到合乎新生活的標準、並養成自動的始終實行新生活的精神、</p>
<p>第二、擬責公安分局分所、切促所屬員警以身作則去勁導市民實行新生活、規定時期舉行檢查各分局所屬的住戶、是否實行新生活、其能切實施行新生活之住戶、加以名譽上的獎勵、其不實行新生活者、或實行不力者、用和藹的熱誠的態度、加以規勤、務使其能實行新生活、</p>
<p>第三、擬定時間會同有關係之機關或人員、舉行全市清潔總檢查、務使全市時常保持清潔、以增市民之康健、嚴肅市容、藉壯觀瞻、以增我國民的國際地位、</p>
<p>以上所擬三點、決在今年內逐漸見之實施、</p>
<p>（四）我最後誠懇希望各界人士、今後唯有依照領袖的新生活運動所指示的各事項、身體力行、由個人實踐禮義廉恥、在日常生活中、做到整齊·清潔·簡單·樸素·迅速·確實·進而團體的實踐禮義廉恥、團體的做到整齊·清潔·簡單·樸素·迅速·確實、再進而全國人都一致實踐禮義廉恥、全國人都一致做到整齊·清潔·簡單·樸素·迅速·確實、再進而全國人都一致實踐禮義廉恥、全國人都一致做到整齊·清潔·簡單·樸素·迅速·確實、能如是、我們的民族、才能得到復興起來、我們國家的一切奇恥大辱、才能得到完全湔雪、由此就可以證明瓣生活運動、乃完成我們民族復興運動的一種偉大工作、影我同胞、一致興起、實行新生活運動、</p>

<p>梅蘭芳之答詞</p>
<p>梅蘭芳博士答詞謂、主席、諸位先生、今天承蒙諸位先生在這里替蘭芳餞行、實在是非常的榮幸、非常的感謝、剛才諸位先生、對於蘭芳說了許多勸勉獎譽的話、勸勉的呢、蘭芳終身不敢忘記、獎譽的呢、實在是不敢當、記得四年前、到美國去的時候、也是承蒙諸位先生的指敎同贊助、現在到蘇俄去、還是蒙諸位先生的熱心、讓我國的戲劇、可以推進到國界以外去、叫蘭芳也可以達到多年的志願、這是蘭芳心中所非常感激的、這一次到俄國去的事、差不多已經醖釀到一年多了、還是去年二月間、蘇聯政府方面、託我國駐俄大使館、來約蘭芳前去表演、當時蘭芳沒有敢昧然的答應他、因爲蘇聯是一個文學·戲劇·音樂·最偉大的國家、自從革命以後、他們政府方面、更是極力的提倡、所以成績也就一日千里、蘭芳如果去俄國、固然是可以借這個機會去參觀參觀、研究研究、也或者可以得到一點見識加烕、但是在另一方面說、也實在是恐怕自已的能力不夠、恐怕不能夠把中國戲劇的精義貢獻給人家、所以當時不敢馬上答應、後來、蘇聯方面、再三的來約、電報同信、一連接了幾十封、他們說、要蘭芳去表演、完全是研究的性質、信上的意思、說得非常的懇切、我國政府方面、聞顏大使因爲邦交的關係、也都主張蘭芳答應下來、所以蘭芳才敢勉強的擔任、決定之後、蒙政府當局同顏大使諸公、加以種種的援助、上海諸位先生、又組織了一個戲劇恊進社、指導同贊助、都非常的熱心、實在是呌蘭芳非常感激不過最初發起戲劇恊進社的史量才先生、未曾等到蘭芳出國、他就與我們長別了、今天、不能聽到史先生的訓勉、這是蘭芳心中很覺得難過的一件事、蘭芳這一次到俄國去、心中很是可憂慮、爲什麼呢、就是因爲東西兩方的戲劇、他的表演方式、是絕對不同的、而且我剛才說過、蘇聯又是一個文學同戲劇最偉大的國家、蘭芳的表演、能滯使蘇聯的人民滿意呢、所以自已很覺得疑慮、還得希望今天在座的諸位先生要多多的加以指敎、這是蘭芳心中所最盼望的一件事、蘭芳在俄國表演之後、還要到歐洲各國去參觀參觀他們的戲劇、不過是將來回國之後、能否有點心得、回來報告、實在是毫無把握、說起來也真覺得慚愧得很、蘭芳同劇團、已定後天隨同顏大使乘蘇聯派來的輪船、直到海參崴、再山海參崴乘西比利亞火車到莫斯科、時間很忽促、剛剛這兩天又演了幾天義務戲、所以來不及到諸位先生那裹去一一的辭行啦、今天、就乘這個機會向諸位先生辭別、等到將來回國的時候、再向諸位先生報告一切、今天謝謝諸位銜生的盛意、並且敬祝諸位先生的健康、</p>
<h3 id="c134">市府化騐火井真相 <a href="#c134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>地底煤悄等受作用後出沼氣</p>
<p>遂有火力蘊蓄豐否須經測勘</p>
<p>本市臺州會館之火井、自經華東社記者發現宣佈後、一時觀者甚多、社會人士、亦紛加推測、以爲地下蘊有火量、將如火山之爆發、滬上人士乃呈請市府、加以化騐、如果蘊蓄火力、大可煉取燃料、否則利棄於地、未免可惜、茲經市府派員化騐結果、乃爲該火井之地下、因垃圾煤屑等起作用而發出沼氣、火力甚弱、不能作爲燃料、茲將市府化騐結果錄下、</p>
<p>派員化驗</p>
<p>上月間該項火井發現後、本市市民張寅等、即呈市府請加以化騐、如果爲地底蘊蓄天然火力、則可利用之而爲工業燃料之用、市府據呈、即於日前派社會局工業試騐所人員、前往化騐、業已有結果、</p>
<p>出火原因</p>
<p>據該局分析結果、該項氣體、係屬沼氣、俗稱「天然瓦斯」、爲有機物質、經腐朽作用而生成、想該公所昆鄰陸家浜、因該浜近年用垃圾及煤屑等填塞、垃圾地中受潮混壓力熱力等作用分解、成此種氣體、化騐結果列後、乘隙縫而穿出地面、該公所原有廢井、恐適當其衝、性噴出壓力不強、火力甚弱、似難供工業上之用、至地中蘊儲是否豐富、則須專家測勘、方能斷定云、</p>
<p>化騐結果</p>
<p>工業試騐所發表化騐火井內所含之各種成分如下、沼氣（Ｍatbane）百分之六·七、氫（Ｈydrogen　Hz）百分之一二·八、一氮（Nitrogen　Hz）百分之一三·八六、二氧化石炭（Carbon　dioxide　Ｃoz）百分之二·一八、氧化石炭、（Ｃarbon　Monoxide　Co.）百分之○·一○、發熱量、（Ｈeating　Valen　s410.iikg　Cal/liter）</p>

<p>任何運動、其運動的本身、並非我們的目的、而僅爲推行某種目的的方法、開會演講、登報宣傳、祇是運動的手段、而非運動的目的、任何運動的倡導者、倘使錯認了手段爲目的、必無倖成的可能、（參看拙著新生活運動者應有之素養、晨報、二十三、十一、二十一、）</p>
<p>中國晚近以來的歷史、有一個富有「運動性」的重要特微、以往各種運動的目的、無疑的都要想挽救垂危的國運、振發萎麼的民心、但是、我們如果用客觀的態度、來加以公平的檢討、則一切轟轟烈烈的運動、大都祇有一時的與奮、而示收普遍的實效、缺乏誠意、這並不是我個人主觀的武斷、而是每一個真實關心國是的人、應該共同承受的歷史敎訓、</p>
<p>新生活運動、當然是一個改造國民復興民族的運動、（參看拙著民族復興與國民生活之改造、晨報二十三、十一、二十一、）但是我們如果要想實現其如此偉大的使命、首先應當避免陷入以往一切救國運動失敗的覆較、澈底的清除、那些實錄時會、取巧投機、陽奉陰違、欺世盜名、心不顧言、言不顧行的腐化份子、新生活運動與其被這些腐化份子所摧殘而夭折、則寗可暫時的「吾道不行」、而絕對不要讓他們來大言欺世、失信於民、失信於民、是政治上最危險的事、中國人民對於政治或其他公衆事業所以不感興趣、不肯認真、雖是因爲政治敎育不發展、其實這也是一個值得考慮的問題、我們如果要推行政令、啓發國民政治的興趣、首應「示民以信」、否則、任何運動、惟有盡驅民衆、趨於虛驕卑鄙之岐途、而我偉大純正之民族、亦惟有日趨墮落而已、我個人、敢說一向是一個新生活力行者、我當然極不願意我的話不幸而言中、而且、民族的生命、已如此危亟、尤其不容我們一誤再誤、使這一個負有再造民族生命之重要使命的運動、傭是蹈了以往的覆轍、因此本我滿腔的熱誠、提出以下三個最低度、應當做到的希望、</p>
<p>一·希望今後每一個新生活運動者要力戒虛僞、拿出真誠、言行相顧、以身作則的力行、</p>
<p>二·希望社會人士、要一致的澈底的明白是非、擁護公道、因爲祇有在一個是非分明、公道昭張的社會、大家才願實壽禮義、才能懂得廉恥、</p>
<p>三·希望政府當局、要澈底的、嚴格的明定賞罰、振肅紀綱清除貪污、因爲祇有在一個賞罰分明、貪污絕跡紀綱振肅的國家、社會才有是非、才有公道、而民衆才會明禮義、知廉恥、有紀律、守秩序、否則、在好人終是吃虧的變態社會律之下、有誰願束身自好呢、（參看拙著生活運動與政治改革、晨報元旦特刋、）</p>
<p>以上三個希望、理論極其平凡、實際則最重要、祇要知而能行、實踐並不困難、今後我們的政府、和人民、一定要真實不虛、腳踏實地的實踐了這三點、中國的政治、和會、和人心、才有澈底改造的可能與實際、而我們中華民族的前途、也才得有復興的希望、二十四年新生活運動週年紀念日草於滬之自力齋、</p>

<p>— 趒史媞</p>
<p>最近一兩年來，各個活躍的都市裹，在那些美妙的婦女身上，可以看見一襲曵地的長袍。當高跟鞋踏著有韻的聲音時，這輕軟的衣角，波動著，顯出更婀娜的風姿。聽說長衣的流行，也有著很曲年的經歷。幾年前，巴黎的綢緞業者，爲了自已貨品的過剩，於是設法聯絡時髦的縫衣匠，把輕盈的短裝，變做了婆娑的長衣。當婦女們必須拉起自已的裙幅，慢慢地移步，綢緞商的出品他就獲得了充分的銷路。記得去年夏季，不穿襪得了充分的銷路。記得去年夏季，不穿襪子，一時盛行在時髦的女人羣裹，這樣襪業受到了很深的影響，我們的商人也想出了些聰明的方法，一致請求政府，禁止赤足，以正頹風，而維商業。但收效未著。這些巴黎的綢緞商，其手段之巧妙與否，真不能同日而語。</p>
<p>時至今日，婦女們的一舉一動，都受到嚴格的限止，好像社會不安，民生凋敝，以及一切不幸事件的發生，都是由於婦女們新奇的服裝，惹人的色笑所引起。於是傳來了大批禁止的呼聲。禁止穿拖地的旗袍，禁止女學生們塗脂抹粉，還有禁止其他種種，真使人目迷五色，不知所從。這繁複的禁條，實在不容易明白清楚，自已稍一不慎，也有些違禁危險。然而也許爲了大部份婦女不會也不願懂得那些被禁的原因，於是抹粉的依舊抹粉，塗脂的仍是塗脂，拖地的長袍，也不曾剪短了一分一寸。這恰好吻合了那一句女人是無理性的生物。</p>
<p>是的，那些妖艷的服裝，惹眼的珍飾，不但加重了世紀末的頹唐病，而且把成千萬的金錢，送往別國，得來的沒有一些實用，除了催促自已這一族速地走上滅亡的道路。禁止，不論那是如何的嚴萬，也是理所當然，不可非議。然而我們曾經聽見過，說是對於一事一物的處理，禁止也者，只是屬於消極的一端。這兒不妨學習一次綢緞商的辦法，利用婦女界唯一的通病——趨尚時髦，運動那些名墾閨秀，貴婦人，紅影星，以及歌女舞娘，只要是婦女界側目的人物，起來以身作則，造成一種新的習尚，那時不須要禁止，不須要嚴令，她們會馴良地追隨著走上了另一條路。</p>

<p>— 康健齋夫</p>
<p>無錫敎育學院與中大農學院於去歲年底合向美國定購優種豬玀二十一頭，於日前乘××總統號到滬。院內特派「專員」迎提，轉乘京滬火車到了無錫車站，改乘黃包車拉去。不料其中一頭中途脫籠而出，奔入一家鐵舖。那天正值廢歷除夕前一晚。店主人以爲活豬入門，大不吉利，攔豬不放。專員下車交涉，復經警察開導，結果講定條件：由敎育學院於第二天派人用「六隻眼晴」燒還利市，由安局擔保。</p>
<p>敎育學院方面爲結好民衆，迎回洋豬起見，當即於第二天用小豬頭一隻，瘦鷄一頭，四寸長鯉魚一尾，元寶一串，商陞三響，䩱砲五百，派了院內農夫前往逃豬鐵舖履行條約，那頭洋豬，纔得欣然並載而歸。</p>
<p>據說那外國豬玀每頭價約二十五美金，運費每頭約二十美金，加上其他雜費。每頭合華幣一百六十元。那種豬玀生長力特強。出胎四個月後，最大者已長到一百六十五磅，這豬名呌Ｃhester,White,渾身白毛。另一種名呌Ｐoland,china，是中波混合種，毛色黑多白少。最奇者爲Ｄuroc,jersey,毛衣爲純黃色，因這名字頗不易記，因戲譯其音爲「大學敎授」云。</p>

<p>海上銀星胡蝶女士，伊是在「左頰」上有一笑渦，伊是美的，不待言了，——諸君到過平津的，可記得有個唱西河大鼓的王諷詠女士嗎？伊那繞樑不絕的聲調，真要超過山東犁花片，恐怕老殘在趵突泉所捧的黑妞，白紐，也比伊不過呢！伊也是最美的，「右頰」上有一笑渦，伊是河北易縣人，常說；「京西山水，比並東南，」產生佳麗，原不足異，獨能與胡蝶女士，一左一右，配成南北兩笑渦，是真無獨有偶了！</p>

<p>第九回　不善恭維求人遭叱咤未能歸去隨客惑誇張</p>
<p>茶房向胡氏母女看了一遍，對他笑道：倒難得這位張先生這樣的熱心。說畢，微笑而去。張介夫明知道茶房是有了一點誤會，可是和程聲前作媒也好，和高廳長作媒更好，這無傷於自已的身分的。當茶房去了以後，自已本想再到西餐廳的窗戶外去看看。可是馬這兩個窮女人放在屋子裹，散亂東西很多，有些不大妥當。所以忍住了這口勁，沒有走開，卻和胡氏談著閑話。胡氏倒想不著這位老斧這樣的有談有笑，卻也很高興。約莫談了有上十分鐘，茶房還沒有來回信，伸頭向穿子外望望，也沒有蹤影。這裹到那大廳，只是前後院，何以去這樣久？想到這可疑之點，就背了兩隻手，在屋子裹來回踱著步子，藉以減少心裹的煩悶。然而走有四五個來回時，便又感到了煩悶了，心想，縱然是窮人可靠，但我走出去了，不過是在院子裹站著，一個初到大地方來的婦人，究竟也沒有這樣大的膽，敢隨便在屋子裹來拿東西，便是拿了東西，他們第得這樣單薄薄的，也沒有法子在什麼地方收藏，那末，還是大著膽子出去看看罷。這樣想著，他就決定著走個那西餐廳後墻的窗戶口子上來了。向裹張望時，程聲前正和一個穿西服的漢子在一邊說話。介夫還不認得此地的建設廳長，心裹也就想著，這個穿西服的人，莫非就是的。於是悄悄的放著腳步，閃到窗子一邊，卻伸了半邊臉，向窗子裹去看著。只見那穿西服的人皺了眉苦笑著，口裹說什麼，卻因爲他聲音細小，沒有聽得出來。（一三六）</p>

<p>戲碼既定，自就有人下去準備了。</p>
<p>關於唱戲的一切設備，宮裹頭是購置得非常周全的，并且都有人很小心地管理著的，要用時不難一索即得。所有的佈影，戲裝等等，更是無一不精美，再加逢到春天，就適用於春天的行頭，到夏天，秋天，冬天，亦復各各不同。訊者聽了，這些話也許不能深信無疑，以爲這是事實上很不可能的事；然而卻是真的！一天到晚，一年到頭，老是在裁製戲裝或是打好了圖樣發往蘇州或廣東那些地方去定製，總是一些不惜工本的。這一次，他們雖然都不曾隨駕東來，但我們早已把唱戲時應用的各種東西一件也不遺漏的從車上載來了。光是照料這一項如樂品，也有一個老太監負責專司其事，他手下還有一二十個小太監充助手咧。所以我們不論唱什麼戲，只要點下去，便總可以排得出來的，一小半的原因，固然是行頭的齊備，而最大的原因，卻是那些唱戲的太監，不論生旦凈丑，個個都會唱許多的戲，隨時可以湊得起來，不致缺角。</p>
<p>唱戲就不能少戲臺，幸而盛京這些宮院的建築雖然已很破舊，但在某一座大殿前面的空地上，卻也有一座戲臺建著。當然，它的年齡也是很老的了！格式和我們尋常在神廟中所見的戲臺相同，祇有一層樓那樣的高，不過地位比較闊大些。（二四七）</p>

<p>這是一個寒冬的午夜，逆風颼颼吹在身上，好似萬根鋒吹在身上，好似萬根鋒銳的小針剌著一般，白雪庶遍了大地，秀麗的村莊統變成潔白的色彩，因了光綫的反映，遠地看去，好似一片凹凸不平的琉璃。</p>
<p>這時，全村的人們都靜悄悄地去尋那甜密的夢了，在小橋堍帝，有一間稻草蓋成的鳥籠式的小屋紙窗上，一閃一閃的露出弱小的光芒。</p>
<p>一個年已六十餘的老婦，臥在一張破板床上，蓋著一條破棉絮，抵不住那嚴寒的侵略，不住地在抖著，面上雖蒼白得可怕，但是像盼望著什麼似的。</p>
<p>「媽媽……媽媽……我回來了」承著這軟弱的聲音，進來了一個美麗的姑娘大約二十歲光景</p>
<p>「今天怎麼……樣啊」老婦在床上掙扎著地說</p>
<p>「唉！今天」天冷了，大半的客人，都畏縮著不高興出來了祇得著二塊錢，怎麼夠去請大夫和購藥呢？明天的米又沒有了，唉！伊說時，一面嘆著氣，一面拍著身上的雪。</p>
<p>「…………」這樣靜默了一會，</p>
<p>「喂，喂，筱貞回來了嗎」忽然走進一個老者，臉上很顯露出刁滑的神氣，</p>
<p>「唔！回來了。」「四爺！」筱貞說聲音顫得很勵害。</p>
<p>「哈哈！錢怎樣啊？錢啊！」</p>
<p>「真對不住得很。四爺，請你明天來拿吧！」</p>
<p>「咦！那是不可以的，今天一定要的。」</p>
<p>筱貞的凍紅的臉，頓時轉爲灰白。一手把那預算作醫藥費的兩塊錢，戰戰兢兢的交給四爺</p>
<p>「唔！好呀，真是不識抬舉的東西哩！」四爺拿了錢拔步就走，嘴裹還在嘰哩咕囉的說著。</p>
<p>「媽媽，錢沒有了，怎麼辦呢？哦！這樣吧！問程大叔借錢去。」</p>
<p>這時老婦已睡著了，臉上較前更爲蒼白，并且身體不住的抖著。</p>
<p>筱貞等他不響了，急速跑出去。</p>
<p>筱貞終究耐不住嚴寒，而給西北風降服了，從新回進屋子裹面，伊想還有半個麵包，是昨天吃剩的，可給媽媽充饑禦寒。</p>
<p>伊走進灶間，想燒茶喝，一見媽媽沒有呼吸，急忙丟了麵包，跑到床前，目證口呆的立著，隔了好久，才「媽：」的一聲昏過去了。</p>
<p>外面的西北風依舊刮著，一切的一切，依舊是先前的光景，只有屋子裹面有一種隱約而繼續發出的聲音。</p>

<p>— 吳鐵城</p>
<p>自客歲蔣委員長倡導新生活於南昌，舉國景從，中外翕然！用能發爲運動，蔚成風氣，有識之士，靡不視此爲民族復興運動之一大進步，即異邦覘國之士，亦未嘗不感慨贊嘆，以爲新中國之降替，唯一於新生活運動之成敗！處今之世，而不變今之俗，則欲國之不亡，不可得也！溯自有清季世，門戶洞開，內外交迫，民族之北點盡露，曾國落李鴻章輩，震鑠於列強之堅甲利兵，於是派學生，竸製造，思藉聲光電化之學，爲興衰繼絕之圖，然而僅恃技術之模仿，曾何益於國是之更新！康梁乘之，於是發爲變法圖強之說，冀襲東鄰憲政之糟粕，爲中土維新之規模：本末倒置，抑已甚已！吾黨總理孫中山先生，獨能察微見隱，體大思精，以三民主義爲革命建國之準繩。頻年以來，雖憂患迭興，字內騷然，而中樞鞏固，政象不變，國家統一，民族復興之大業，已肇其端。蔣委員長鑒於建國獨立之有賴乎國民的奮起也，復倡爲新生活運動，以禮義廉恥之素行，習於衣食住行之日常生活中，使人人明禮義，知廉恥。負責任，守紀律。此其苦心孤詣，振瞆發聾，謂足正風礪俗，樹開國模規，啓歷史紀錄，誰誰曰不宜！</p>
<p>蔣委員長對於新生活運動之解釋曰：「新生活運動者我全體國民之生活革命也」。其釋禮義廉恥之意義曰：「禮者，理也；是規規矩矩的態度。義者，宜也；是正正當當的行爲，廉者，明也；是清清白白的辦別。恥者，知也；是切切實實的覺悟，」又曰：「恥是行爲之動機，廉是行爲之響導，義是行爲之履踐，禮是行爲之表現，四者相連貫；發於恥，明於廉，行於義，而形之於禮，相需相成，缺一不可！」凡是者，微言精義，亦已爲舉國所共喻矣！鐵城不敏，所欲竭其一得之愚，以求正於同志同胞之前者，則新生活運動之新路綫是也。</p>
<p>夫自歷史的眼光觀之同，中國民族，誠不失爲一偉大優秀之民族，然而近百年來，積習相傳，實有其不可諱之弱點。就公生活言；則無組織，無紀律，無責任；就私生活言；則無組織，無紀律，無責任；就私生活言；則不層階級，蚩蚩䛉䛉，不識不知，衣食而外，不知有物！上層階級，無能無守，畏葸孱弱，溺於文字，不事生產！塌葺惰寙之習，因循媮惰之風，乃得充塞宇內，恣爲厲階！今欲使中國卓然自立於茲世，則必當澈底改造中國之國民生活，使符合於新生活之義，而語其路綫，則不侫以爲有三焉。</p>
<p>一曰國民生活之軍事化，中國文化之邦，夙以文事自誇。自唐以後，歷朝當局，怵於藩鎮之禍，復盛行揚文抑武之策，剛勁之氣，爲之蕩然！夫文事武功，相互表裹，必也文武並盛，始爲一適於生存之民族，若文而不武，則是被征服的奴隸！日人之署　我中國曰：「支那特文字之國！」竟謂中國文學，浩瀚淵博，夐絕古今，但優於文者未必雄於力，故一遇塞外豪族，則覆亡隨之，其言實足警惕，不寗惟是，近代戰爭，爲立體之戰爭，動員乃國民之動員，近代戰具與軍事科學之發展，胥以高度之科學文明爲基礎，中國不欲自存則已，否則必當痛矯歷史的弱點，務提倡科學文明，普及軍事智識，使國民生活軍事化，衣食住行諸端，簡單，樸素，整齊，嚴肅，尤當力謀體育之普遍化同，青年軍事之澈底化，即公務人員，於暇時亦常受軍事訓練，期平時如戰時，緊張嚴肅，明恥敎戰，一洗吾民族孱弱萎摩之歷史的積習！</p>
<p>二曰國民生活之生產化，經濟者立國之大本也。一國政治之隆替，民族之盛衰，胥擊乎是，昔管子有言：「行其山澤，觀其桑麻，計其六畜之產，而國家貧富可知矣。」又曰：「草田多而辟田少者，雖不水早，飢國這野也：若是而民寡，則不足以守其地。……彼民不足以守者，其城不固，民飢者，不可以使戰，業散而不守，則國爲丘墟！」管子生當農業時代同，而經濟之關係於國脈也已如此，況代乎！夫言發展經濟，則生產尚矣。國家當竭全力，謀建設，治水利，闢交通，墾荒地，足民食；運用經濟政策，輔導工商，調整金融。其在國民，則日常生活上當無不使恊於生產之義，即提倡愛惜時間，講求工作效率，視勤勞爲社會之美德，而以不勞而獲遊閒坐食爲深誠。一面則獎勵節約，務使社會之消費量，不逾越社會之生產量。尤當提倡消費的國家觀念，使人人知恒潰購買之會，從一絲縷一文一物之費，亦無不爲國力消長民族盛衰之所由寄，俾全國同胞，共衣中國之衣，食中國之食，住中國之住，行中國之行，生活必需品，能悉仰本國國產，則入超可祛而經濟之國難可紓！新生活運動能全力做到此層，則其嘉惠邦國，亦已溥矣！</p>
<p>三曰國民生活藝術化，新生活運動之方法，重勸導，尚感化，而不採強制之命令式，而欲深入民間，化民成俗，則提倡國民生活的藝術化，實爲必要，良以藝術者，文野之所由判，禮樂者治亂之所由分，姑言音樂，高尚純正之音樂，足以陶治情性，敦厚民族，慰哀怨，揚志氣，使社會生機，爲之盎然；生活興趣，爲之倍增。反之匿　殺伐之聲，靡靡之音，則唯導民於淫成之域，其爲禍有不可勝言者矣。善哉將委員長之言曰；「我們革命訓政，要是從提倡音樂入手，我想收效還要格外迅速，比方講一地方如果能設一個提倡間樂爲主旨的學校，一般老百姓，必然趨之若騖，化民成俗的效力，一定格外來得偉大！」誠獲以國民生活這藝術化爲途徑，則新生活動動，將爲全體國民所樂就，收效之宏，無俟論已。要之，一時代有一時代之使命，一時代有一時化之軌範，中國當新舊交替之會舊者固蕩然無存，新者亦迄未建立，新生活運動實足爲此時之時代的軌範前述路綫，似爲必要，鄙見如此，海內賢達，幸辱敎之！</p>

<p>— 吳開先</p>
<p>一、新生活運動之發軔及進行</p>
<p>（一）新生活運動之發軔</p>
<p>新生活運動，今已普遍全國。自蔣委員長乎訂綱要，以南昌新運會改爲總會，聘請各省市行政長官擔任指導員，並頒發組織大綱統一組織後，各地步驟益齊一，推行益便捷。本市新運發軔于去年三月間，而正式改組成立則於七月間。茲先述其籌備經過如下。</p>
<p>自去年二月蔣委員長提倡新生活運動以來，全國各地，風起雲湧，本市黨政軍各機關當局，以此項運動關擊民族興替，亟應提倡，經聯席會議議決後，即於三月二十日假座楓林橋外交部駐滬辦事處餘屋，開始籌備，發表宣言，微求發起，計加入發起者三百十五人，贊助者三百人，草擬章則，編印宣傳大綱，爲時僅十二日，異常緊張。</p>
<p>（二）工作進行述要</p>
<p>籌備既竣，於四月一日召開成立大會，通過會章公約，決議舉辦宣傳週及實騐區等重要案件，並推選理監事一百七十八人，又推吳市長鐵城擔任理事長。茲將理監事兩會之組織錄之於左。</p>
<p>（甲）理事會　設理事七十九人，候補四十一人。各理事於四月五日在理監事聯席會議時，通過組織規則，並推選常務理事二十一人，組織常務理事會。其集會次數，第一次爲四月五日，（即在聯席會議後舉行）第二次爲四月十六日，第三次爲七月二十四日，各次重要議案，除訂定分會支部組織通則外，餘均詳見會議記錄。理事會之中分設下列四組，各組設正副主任二人，職員若干人。</p>

<p>（四）指導組　主任潘公展，副主任文鴻恩。其工作，除指導各分會成立外，並組織各界勸導隊五百隊，於六月四日在公共體育塲檢閱，衣冠整潔，精神嚴肅，檢閱畢，當即出發各街衢勸導行人。</p>

<p>二，新生活運動之統一及進展</p>
<p>（一）新生活運動促進會之改組成立</p>
<p>本會於七月初旬，接奉南昌總會蔣會之第一號通告，囑即遵照總會所頒布之組織大綱，實行改組，同時蔣會長聘任理事長吳鐵城爲本市指導員，並囑其指導本會改組之。當經開會議決，遵令改組，所有理事會監事會等一律結束，依照新章，向各機關各團體選聘幹事九人，計：市政府俞鴻鈞，市黨部吳開先，社會局吳醒亞，敎育局潘公展，公安憶中文鴻恩，軍界楊虎，學界張壽鏞，工界陸京士，商界俞佐庭，旋即分配職務，呈報總會備案。溯自改組迄今，條將七月，茲將七閱月，歷次幹事會議之情形，略述如左：</p>
<p>第一次幹事會議，在七月三十日，決議案凡四，其重要者，爲分配務：公推吳醒亞楊虎潘公展爲常務幹事，吳開先爲書記，陸京士爲調查股股長，張壽鏞爲設計股股長，文鴻恩爲推行股股長。</p>
<p>第二次幹事會議，在八月十六日，決義案凡三其重要者，爲通過修改之會章。</p>
<p>第三次幹事會議，在十月二十四日，決議案件凡四，其重要者，一爲通過改革禮俗辦法，一爲通過第一期工作計劃。</p>
<p>第四次幹事會議，在十二月二十八日，議決案件凡七，其重要者，一爲文幹事鴻恩因病逝世，推捕文朝籍局長充任幹事兼推行股股長，一爲修正本市青年服務團組織規程及督促實行新生活辦法。</p>

<p>（二）工作方案之進行</p>
<p>綜上所述，自籌備成立以來改組至今經過情形，已可概見，他如實騐區設計委員會之成立，推選委員俞鴻鈞陶百川丁默村楊衛玉邰爽秋等五人，均予前理監事聯席會議時所產生，實騐地點，擬在江灣，或吳淞，屢經開會討論進行，所以經費拮據，未即實現，現所計劃進行者爲（一）督促及考查各機關工作人員之厲行新生活同，（二）督促及考查各公共塲所（如酒樓旅館等）厲行新生活，（三）編訂各種費用美術標語於車廂通衢，指導作法，（四）整頓市容等俱已擬就條例辦法，分別實行。</p>
<p>三，新生活運動今後之主要工作</p>
<p>（一）宣傳方面　欲冀民衆瞭解與認識新運真義，端賴廣大深刻之宣傳，本會所宣傳工作，除已印發標語小冊及舉辦宣傳週提燈大遊行等，已如上述外，終以地廣人稠尚須繼續進行，俾遠家喻戶曉，故本年預定舉辦者，爲樹立永久性標語。擇其衝要通衢，並製霓虹燈及大油漆標語用美術方法警案字句，以發人深省。再如公共車船，每日往來衆多，亦已設法注意。</p>
<p>（二）督促方面　實行新運督促不容稍忽，而此項督促，必要時又須略含強制，俾易收效。本年預定進行之督促工作，擬先自各機關及其工作人員著手，每月製頒反省表，及蔣會長訓示作事條例，伶　其簽認，隨時考核，在公共塲所之新生活運動，亦須同時進行，關於各種條例，刻已全部擬就，即可分發各公共塲所依照實行，一面由公安局隨時巡查取締，當易收效。</p>
<p>（三）勸導方面　公共塲所之歷行新生活因其營業性質，可以強制，但住戶行之之厲行新生活，則除督促外，端賴勁導，關於此事，本會亦已預定辦法，擬組青年服務團，採分團制，於各該區域內，徵求黨員各校學生軍童子軍等爲團員，輸流服務，於星期假日，更往通衢街道，實地指導行人住戶，厲行新生活，其有無理違抗者，規定可請公安局警士帶局面斥。</p>
<p>抑尚有須一述者，即本市以租界關係環境較異，推行新運，未能盡如所期，故所定方案，亦只得因勢利導，逐漸進行，所望各界賢遠，常加指導，事業經費，得早確定，則努力推行，實現方案，新運前途，實利賴焉。</p>
<h3 id="c168">新生活運動之推行 <a href="#c168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— 潘公展</p>
<p>新生活運動，自蔣委員長在南昌發起倡導以來，迄今已一週年。過去一年中，各地相繼響應，先後成立新生活運動促進會者，實不在少數，本市爲東南巨埠，各國觀瞻所擊，新運推行，尤不容緩。第回顧過去成績，範團尚未十分擴大，民衆亦未見普遍力行，頹廢放縱之生活，依然如故。殆亦由於奉行新生活者，未能以其心得廣爲勸告，而播爲風氣所致歟？已逝之光陰，既無法冀其復回，今後這之運動，實不容不加倍努力。鄙見以爲實行新生活者，不可不注意下列各項推行之途徑：</p>
<p>一，由淺入深，新生活之推行，在希望全國人民行爲均合乎禮義廉恥，而於衣食住行各種日常生活中表現之。但上項目標之實現，原非一蹴可幾，宜由淺入深，先其簡易而漸及其繁重，務必不使間斷，逐步進展，以達到生活之藝術化合理化，而適應時代與環境之需要。</p>
<p>二，由近而遠，新生活運動，非一人之事係全民族共同努力之事。譬諸機器，欲其運行敏捷，效能增加，任何一部，均不能失其功用。力行新生活者，應本推已及人之忱，由一身推及一家，由家而推及其鄰里鄉黨，由近及遠，範圍日擴，奉行者亦日漸衆多，庶幾全國人民生活煥烯一新，而人人均爲健全之國民。</p>
<p>三，始終不懈，任何事業之成就，決不在一時興趣之熱烈，而在能持久實行之毅力，故「恒」之一字，爲事業成功之母，新生活運動，在大家提倡之時，自必轟轟烈烈，努力奉行，一旦時過境遷，往往回復其本來面目，而將新生活各種規律，置之腦後，故奉行者須始終不懈，先造成良好之習慣，時間長久，遂安於此種生活而之不覺。</p>
<p>方今國勢危殆，正是中華民族生死存亡關頭，新運之成功與否，爲民族精神之所擊，管子曰，禮義廉恥，國之四維，四維不張，國乃滅亡，設多數人民不知禮義廉恥爲何物，則必是非不辨，公私不察，本末不明，取興不當，青年放僻淫侈，成人則昏庸腐敗，富者務浮華，貧者陷卑污，以此無組織，無規律，無道德之人民，而欲望其能生存現代，豈不甚難，新生活運動，在表面上雖不過使個人生活合乎規律，推其極，則關係於民族生存者至大，故新生活運動乃吾民族自力更生之運動，爲吾民族生活革命之運動，亦了民族復興之運動。吾人負有推行新運之責者，須共解此意，然後始能下最大決心，共同奉守，廣爲勸告，以挽救現在垂危之民族也。</p>
<h3 id="c169">進一步的新生活運動 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 陶百川</p>
<p>爲新生活運動週年紀念作</p>
<p>一　周年紀念進一步</p>
<p>自蔣委員長在去年二月十九日倡導新生活運動以來，大家都認爲這是中國人民生活革命的起點，是復興中華民族的基本工作，於是上行下效，風騒一時。歲月飄忽，現在已是一週紀念了。</p>
<p>新生活運動所標榜的指導原則，是禮，義，廉，恥，而求所以實現此原則者，則首重「規矩」和「清潔」規矩和清潔，固然不失爲很好的目標，但是僅此二者究竟不能達到禮義廉恥的目的；所以我們希望蔣委員長能提出稍高的目標，作「進一步的新生活運動」。</p>
<p>果然，蔣委員長新近告訴我們了：「夫規矩清潔不過爲本運動之開端，亦即本運動之最低標的，在週年之後擬一方保持及充實以往之事功，一方作進一步之推動，即吾人所擬議之全國人民「生活軍事化」，「生活生產化」，「生活藝術化」是也。</p>
<p>從規矩清潔做到生活軍事化，生產化和藝術化，這是「進一步的新生活運動」。</p>
<p>二　生活軍事化</p>
<p>所謂生活軍事化，蔣委員長說：「非欲全國人同時武裝，同趨疆塲；在初步只期其嚴組織，尚團結，守紀律，重秩序，能振作，保嚴肅，一洗從前散亂，浪漫，因循，荀安之習性」，語其要點，有如左列：</p>
<p>一·升降國旗要敬禮。</p>
<p>二·間黨歌要起立。</p>

<p>主席各位先生、今天上海青年會要我來講「上海的敎育」問題、就我的地位、現今日在擔任敎育方面行政事務、所以對這題目、在責任上不能推論、不過要我怎麼樣來把「上海的敎育」完全說個明白、可也沒有這個本領、而且在這很短的時間以內、如事事用統計的數字來詳細報告、恐怕不可能、並且各位聽了也覺麻煩、再老實說一句、現今的敎育統計字、因爲有種種環境的牽得十分可靠、不過、這種統計數字雖不一定可以相信、然而不妨拿牠做個大略的參考、所以我現在想把上海市的敎育——學校敎育——分類把牠的統數字先作一簡單報告、報告之後、我們就根據這統計數字、大家來討論、看上海市的敎育今後的改進究竟應注重那些地方、</p>
<p>上海市政府、每年皆出版有一本統計書、把上海市的「敎育」「衛生」「公安」等等各種事業都發表數字統計「」但這是依照會計年度也版的、比如民國二十二年度的統計、是從民國二十一年七月起到民國二十三年六月止、而民國二十三年的統計、牠是從二十三年七月起要到二十四年六月止、因爲這樣、所以我現在報告的統、是民國二十二年度的統計、是從民國二十一年七月起到民國二十三年六月止、而民國二十三年度的統計、牠是從二十三年七月起要到二十四年六月止、因爲這樣、所以我現在報告的統計、是民國二十二年度（二十三年六月止）的統計、這統計正在印刷、不久出版、然究是比較最近一的種統、照這裹面看、現今上海市全市人口舉其成數共計有三百四十多萬人、總括市政府範圍以及公共租界法租界在內在這擁有三百四十多萬人口的都市裹里、共有多少學校呢、我們現在不分牠公立和私立、祇說小學·中學·大學統計的總數、（一）初等學校（包括幼稚、短期小學、初級小學、高級小學、）計有八百四十九所、中等學校（包括初級中學、高級中學、師範學校、職業學校、）計有一百三十七所、高等學校（包括專科學校、獨立學院、大學校）、計有三十三所、這初·中·高·三個等級的學校合總起來的數目、是有一千零十九所、（一）初中高三個等級的學校裹面學生人數、要以初等學校爲最多、中等學校次之、高等學校又次之、計初等學校有小學生十五萬八千一百六十四人、中等學校有學生三萬二千六百四十八人、高等學校有學生一萬二千一百四十一人、合併起來學的總數是二十萬二千九百五十三人、（三）除了學生以外、我們還要注意到敎職員、初等學校敎職員有六千四百五十九位、中等學校敎職員有三千七百八十二位、高等學校敎職員有二千三百六十三位合總目是一萬千六百零四位、（四）至於各等級學校每年經費數目、初等學校是四百十一萬一千零七十三元、中等學校是三百九十二萬六千七百四十八元、高等學校是六百四十三三六千二百四十二元、合計各校經費總數共支一千四百四十七萬四千零六十三元、</p>
<p>我們先把二十二年度的各種統計數字提綱挈領說一下之後、再同上一年比較、可以說二十二年度比二十一年度每種的總數字都有了相當進步、（一）學校總數、二十一年度是九百六十七所、二十二年度度一千零十九所、這是增加五十二所、其間初等學校、在二十一年度是七百九十二所、到二十二年度已有八百四十九所、所加的五十七所學校都是小學、至於中學、大學、同上年度比較、祇有減少、並沒加多、如中等學校、在二十一年度有一百四十一所、到二十二年度祇有一百三十七所、減少四所、高等學校、在二十一年度有三十四所、但二十二年度祇有三十三所、減少一所、（二）再看學生的總數、二十一年度是十八萬五千六百六十一人、二十二年度就有二十萬二千九百五十三人、這裹面加了將近兩萬人、究竟加的是什麼學生呢、照中等學校學生人數同上年度比較、二十一年度中等學生是二萬九千一百二十二人、二十二年度有三萬二千六百四十八人、中間加了三千多學生、高等學校學生數呢、在二十一年度、高等學生是一萬三千二百二十七人、到二十二年度祇有一萬二千一百四十一人、到二十二年度祇有一萬二千一百四十一人、中間倒反減少了一千多學生、至於初等學校的學生數、在二十一年度內、小學校的學生是十四萬三千三百一十二人、到二十二年內有十五萬八千一百六十四人、中間差不多加了一萬五千人、所以這年度增加的學生、以小學生爲最多、（三）各等級學校的經費也是同樣、以初等敎育方面加的多、中等學校二十一年度經費是三百九十一萬五千四百七十九元、二十二年度經費加至三百九十二萬六千七百四十八元、高等學校二十一年度經費是五百六十二萬八千五、百九十六元、二十二年度經費加至六百四十三萬六千二百四十二元、初等學校二十一年度經費是三百三十二萬五千四百二十一元、二十二年度加至四百十一萬一千零七十三元、這與上年度比較、等學校差不多增多了八十萬元經費、而中學和大學祇稍爲增加了一點、所以、我們從這個簡單的統計報告裹里、可以比較的得到一點安慰、就是從一般的狀況看起來、雖然在國難嚴重、社會經濟凋敝、大家生計艱難、這樣情形之下、而上海市的學校敎育、由整個的講、二十二年度比二十一年度是有相當進步、尤其可喜的、這個進步的大部份在初等敎育方面、初等敎育的學校數量有增加、不生人數有增加、經費數目也有增加、而且增加到很多、如小學生增加至一萬五千人、經費加至八十萬、這與中等敎育高等敎育學生數與經費數相比、他們祇略加了一點、並且數目很微、這是比較可以安慰的事情、</p>
<p>爲什麼只說比較的可以安慰呢、這一點、我個人要把牠說個明白、這也是我處在現時代的中國、對於敎育一種見解、不能不把牠說出來、假使我的見解是對的、那末·這個報告的事實是可喜的、如果我所說的見解、各位以爲不對、則今日的報告、就不是比較可喜的事情、甚至是可怕的、或者是可痛的、這就要看各人對於敎育的觀點如何、對於敎育的認識如何、而後決定其對於現在的敎育見解應該注意到那一點、（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c212">文藝經紀人 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 仲元</p>
<p>這是一句老調；資本主義的社會裹萬般皆有商品化的危險，因而即使是文學藝術亦難倖免。</p>
<p>資本主義達到最高峯的，是北美的「金圓王國」。那邊文藝商品化，不用說是一個事實。自然，這不是說「金圓王國」內凡屬主藝必爲商品化，而說商品化的文藝非常之多而已。例如替軍火商（或者說是美帝國主義也不要緊）推廣銷路的鼓吹戰爭的學作品，便是紅極一時的「商品」，是儼然替「國家社會」乃至「人類」服務的。至不濟的，是那些給有閒的老爺太太少爺小姐們「消閒」的文藝品，雖則只能視同「奢侈品」，可是也擁有廣大的市塲。</p>
<p>然而「金圓王國」的文藝市塲上還有「文藝經紀人」。說起來，所謂「經紀人」老實就是「掮客」，可是美國的「文藝經紀人」儼然又是中國科舉時代的「房官」的身份。投稿由「經紀人」舉薦到了各雜誌各書店去，就有綠用的希望了。牌子好的「經紀人」在任何編輯那裹都有很大的信用。編輯人要找某種作品時，也請「經紀人」設法。「經紀人」生意好的，一個星期內會收到一百五六十部小說，——都是等候舉薦的。</p>
<p>這樣，大多數美國無名作家的作品是先經過了「經紀人」的舉薦，然後又經由編輯人的錄取，然後能夠和讀者見面。</p>
<p>中國倒底還是資本主義落後的國家，所以雖則有商品化的「文」，而且也有商品化的「文人」，而且更有「商定」的「文人」，但是正式的「文藝經紀人」好像還沒有。</p>
<p>不過這只限於當代人和當代的作品。至於古供人和古代的作品不能爲例。好像中國倒底是五千年文化之古國，古來作者如毛，作品浩如因海，—正跟「金圓王國」的定期編輯部每天平均收到三百篇稿件一樣多，因而勢非有「經紀人」不可的。此方說，要沒有胡適博士的推薦，「經紀人」不可的。此方說，要沒有胡適博士的推薦，「醒世姻緣」如何能成爲「家誦戶曉」呢？要如沒有林大師的推薦，「袁中郎」他們又如何能上「上折八扣」的馬路書攤？我們的古代文家不能不感謝後代的「經紀人」呀！</p>
<p>然而又像「金圓王國」的「經紀人」「承認一個有希望的新作家簡直等於一年的好收穫」一般，我們這里發見一個「有希望」的古代文豪也不過一年有那麼一個半個。去年是袁中郎了，不知今年是誰呵？</p>
<h3 id="c213">從北四川路底寄的一封信 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 鄉愚</p>
<p>遠偉兄！</p>
<p>幾個月沒有什麼好報告你。你一而再，再而三地來信，如果再不回你的信，似乎有些講不過去，所以寫了這一封信。在這個裹，你可以看出我是在盡義務，並不是報告消息，即是有一些消息，也是無關重要的。同時我所報告的，也許是你不願知道的，而你願意知道的，又是我所不願報告的。你可不要當我有意和你鬧別扭，我就是這樣一個怪脾氣的人，人家愈要我追究我的個人方面的某一事件，我愈不願提起，人家愈不願聽我個人方面的某一事件，我愈要講起，所以我常是答非所問。這結果你也早以可以料想到，不必我來聲明，好在我已講過，這是在盡義務，盡義務的信，你不能希望太奢。我自然又是濤星唱曲，報告一些老套，這老套也行你早已耳朶聽膩，覺得有些討厭，但這又有什麼辦法呢？我就是這樣的一個人！聽好我開始報告了。</p>
<p>我並沒有病得要死，像你所憂疑的一樣，這一件事在關心我的健康的你，也許會喜歡到某種程度的。不過我雖沒有死，但不生不死的狀態，原與你同我在一起的一樣。早上人家已起來，我仍舊直挺挺地在床上，晚上人家還沒有上床，我早又直挺挺地睡在床上，睡眠的時間比人家多，可是睡著的時間卻比人家少。有月亮的夜，看著月亮升到中央，看著月亮落下去，看著太陽升起來；有風的夜，聽著風的呼吼，聽著空巷的野狗的悲慘的呌聲，聽著遠㝚餛飩擔的獻拆聲，聽著半夜有閒的人們從跳舞塲回來的汽車聲，聽著鄰近的天亮工廠放汽笛聲。眼睜著看夜完，看白天開始。白天開始後，有時雖則可以朦朧地睡一會，但至多兩點釧的短短的時間，風又受了極大驚嚇似地心一跳醒了。從此就是吟咒也不能再睡熟了。爬起來，則身上每個細胞都載滿了疲乏似的，睡下去，又不能合眼。「怎麼辦呢？怎麼辦呢？」以前我時常這樣絕望的喊，現在我還是這樣絕望地喊。</p>
<p>我不願去看醫生，事實上我們這樣的窮人，也看不起醫生，即是有力量去看醫生一次兩次，也決沒有什麼果可言的。我這病不是藥物所能治療，找早已知道，也許自然療養，會減少病的程度，然而也決不是短時間所能見効果的。除此以外，別無更好的方法。長期離開此地休養，爲事實所不許，只好每天早晨與晚上，利用一些空閒，負了一顆沉重心，到虹口公園去散一會兒步，要想藉此消散一些心中的悶氣，可是結果不但悶氣散不了，卻轉添了一些閒氣。你和我的個性，根本是兩個典型的，你能比我寛容，而我是胸境太狹隘了。你能什麼事都不認真，而我什麼事都認真。我的失眠癥，也就由此而來。其實在這樣一個黑鐵時代，原不該認真的，我的認真，我自已也知道，不知受了多少閒氣，碰過芪少釘子，最後還落得「傻瓜」之名，供人玩笑。承你的好意，時常呌我改改我的癖性。然而生就了的脾氣，是沒法更改的，除非再投過人生，似有更改的可能。不過你的好意，我卻是接受的，因爲你終是唯一好意對待的我朋友，不多談了，就此帶住吧。祝你安好。石頑</p>
<h3 id="c214">鄉村調查 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 徐盈</p>
<p>我拿著一捲調查表格走出關帝廟後，一路走著一路想。</p>
<p>像個夢·人生旅途多變幻，從鄉村師範畢業以後，朋友們走到東走到西，像小池塘的浮萍；浮萍逐漸變作浮雲，無休止地在天南地北移動。譬如彥，就是寄我一捲調查表的那個人，過去本是雄心勃勃，想要招軍買馬有大企圖的大人物，誰想到兩年沒見，他已經屆就了統計員的職務，而作著數字的奴隸。……</p>
<p>短街上很熱鬧，像水流似的趕腳人，快到過年的時候了，人們都忙著到城裹作生意。我們村子主要出產是土布，是柳條子編的箱子，筐子，籃子，以及小玩藝等。男人們這時候真是像聚賭一樣地熱心，滿頭的汗流著。熟識我的人在路上不斷和我打招呼，大家都在埋頭趕路。</p>
<p>我走著看那些表格上的問題，問題雖詳，但易使答的人心煩。我是這樣想，藉這機會和鄉村婦女們談談話。說來可憐，自從我來這裹敎書以後，我還沒有得到一個十五歲以上的女學生。</p>
<p>走到村西第一家，我拍門，門上的「福」字很黯淡。</p>
<p>有人走出來，在門縫裹張了張就說：「老大不在家，下半天來吧！」是女人的聲音。</p>
<p>「不一定找老大，那一位都行。」我說。</p>
<p>女人進去哄孩子，不理我。</p>
<p>這樣的釘子連碰了幾下之後，我才得到一個機會和一位頭髪斑白了的老太婆交談。問了幾個問題之後，不料那老太婆那變了臉。</p>
<p>「問這些幹什麼？」老太婆翻著爛眼皮「我早就聽說你們和縣裹鉤著的，問有多少地，你還要加俺們捐？問老人年紀，你可要跪靈盆？收成好壞，你們敎書的問不著？那一年不是這樣，查一回捐多回稅，誰不在說，城裹來的那有好人！……」</p>
<p>蒙著這不白之冤，我又囓唇作苦笑，腳步又踏在次一家，手在輕輕地敲門環，我忽的聽到裹面惡狗在狂吠，繼而一個小孩子，喊著娘，從裹面出來開門，見是我，默了一下，便即刻鞠躬呌「老師」，我便撫著他的青皮頭頂問：「媽在家嗎？」</p>
<p>「姐姐在！」我的小學生說。</p>
<p>一個很大方的小腳女人從二門裹走出來，一身藍布褲褂，平頭正臉，大眼睛，黑漆頭髪，上有白頭繩。她向我微微點頭，並不羞澀的問道：「先生找家母有事嗎？」</p>
<p>「沒什麼」，我不標對這開通的鄉下婦女，啓始驚訝。「我是有一點調查，要想請敎，就是關於鄉村的各種情形。」我恐怕這種話她不懂，便又加解釋道在像種多少地啦？僱幾個工啦，每年收多少租啦！……</p>
<p>「我知道，」那女人把話接過去，「我伴著蕭老師住的時候，她也愛問這些事情，可惜是我們鄉下人都不清楚，總以爲是捐啦稅啦，就誤會老師們好意，我和蕭老師……」</p>
<p>一個舊影子泛上心頭，我想：莫非這就是吳二寡婦。繞了一個圈子，我問我那小學生，「這位是你二姐吧，」他說不錯。</p>
<p>她告我許多，我要知道的事情，不只是自已的，隣居他也很清楚，正說著，一個老太婆從外面回來，進門時候便喊：</p>
<p>「知道不知道是住娘家，和什麼人瞎三說四……」</p>
<p>我又調查了幾家，結果都不不大好。第二天，吳家孩子上學時候告訴我：「姐姐說，沒問完的今天嚮午還可以去，那時候媽出去鬬牌。」</p>
<p>說真的，這開通女人在鄉村調查上第一次幫我的忙。</p>

<p>夜的街上；冷靜，憂鬰。時間在半夜，站在寶善街延益里里口的，只有一個年青的崗警。他穿著黑色的棉大衣，從老遠望去，直挺挺的彷彿夜鬼。他站崗，爲了居民的安寗，無論在那一晚，須在這裹站三個鐘點；三個鐘點內，如果寶善街上發生偷竊，暗殺，搜刦，起火等事，那重大的責職，就壓在這崗警的身上。爲了他的職務，他不能擅穢了開的：應在每一分鐘裹，守望著寶善的動靜。</p>
<p>已是一點多鐘了——今夜。</p>
<p>他剛是上班的班的時間是在四點。</p>
<p>半點鐘前，他還在眠床裹瞌睡，敬著惝恍的夢：夢見和秋花姑娘躲在漆黑的大門邊戲謔。他看她的頭髪，眼睛，朡脯，手，腳，鼻子，沒有一樣不美麗。他捉她手，剛握到，瞧見秋花的臉紅了，紅得像三月的桃花；那炙紅了的，又像醉後的雙頰，使他興奮得瘋狂，正想抱抱她，夢突然醒過來了，站崗的時間也到了，於是他爬起來，接著，跑到這裹黑暗的街上來站崗。</p>
<p>他想，想著秋花：</p>
<p>「秋花這小妖精……」</p>
<p>這麼想，他便不期然的笑了。那秋花，是一個了頭，住在延益里的第三個牆門裹。他日裹站崗，每天看見她的；看見她從延益里出來，從延益里進去，不知不覺中，他們互相勾搭了。</p>
<p>今夜是他們約會的日子。</p>
<p>他做了這個夢，跑到寶善街來站崗，他的心總覺得那麼不安定；無垠的沈寂，更給他不可抵抗的威脅。他的腳底上，好像塗了油似的，再也站不穩了。</p>
<p>「哦。此刻，哦。秋花一定在那兒等我……」</p>
<p>重覆地想，他的黑影終於移動了，躡躡的跑進延益里去。但不到一刻鐘，這崗警便走出延益里，依舊站到那個老地方。</p>
<p>「哈哈！秋花這小妖精……」</p>
<p>想。臉上又微微的笑了。</p>
<h3 id="c216">嚮晚（一） <a href="#c216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>嚮晚。</p>
<p>天空慢慢兒灰暗下來。像一條躺在泥沼裹的蛇似的三新街，此刻也慢慢兒僵硬起來，幾成條鉛色的街了。</p>
<p>初夏底天氣，晚風也是暖和的了。人們走出到街上來散步，已經很少穿著長掛的。拖鞋底鐵搭聲，時時在高低不平的馬路上響出。黃色車夫零零落落地，各攔著一輛空車，有氣沒力地挨在馬路底一旁走：白灰色的車座上，時時有行人們影子投下來。</p>
<p>在一座高大的洋房門外，這時出現了二個青年。一高一矮，蝅生成的一對配當。高的，穿著通不很稱身的瘦削而又短小的長布褂，西裝褲腳長長的拖著地，祇看到尖頭的皮鞋，俯仰起伏地拍著地面，大有不勝感慨系之的神氣。矮的，穿著通大翻領白襯衫，長長的襯衫下擺，直拖到膝頭。發展的朡部，已輕把襯衫胸前五個骨鈕，擠掉了三個；穿著雙陳嘉庚的橡皮鞋，一步輕一步的走過街頭；同時，他那襯衫也時時一歙一闊地把那過分「膨脹」的朡部，向這不景氣的街頭示威。</p>
<p>走不多遠路；這一對天生配當，竟向左面轉去。那是通向歆生路去的一條小街道。</p>
<p>街頭雖然小，可是風度卻是滿大的。從這一頭到那一頭，不上百來閒門面。煙館子和賣藥膏的店舖，足足要佔上一半。這些煙館子和藥膏店，不但左隣右舍地相連接，且還門當戶對地夾著條馬路賽闊氣。</p>
<p>人行道是全場壞了的。窯地一塊又一塊地接著。有幾處且留積著屋主人潑出來的洗面水和垃圾。但行人卻還是不絕如縷地往來著。這些人，大都是帶著付黃茄子似的臉。尖著發黑的嘴，蓬著將枯的髪，緣著深陷的眼：再加上貓那麼地拱著的背，破碎到露肘露膝的灰黑色的衣服。——活像新從地底攢出來的一付骷髏。生命於他們是多餘的。</p>
<p>然而他們卻各有一種不很安分企求。</p>
<p>他們有的，用碧緣的眼，尋覓人行道上或馬路上拋棄的香煙蒂頭，有的，仲著鼻子在䠗著沿街發散著的一種香氣。他們每走過一家廠開著寫有紅字的門面在館子時，他們就停下腳，抽著鼻著，吸呀的不住的吸。同時，他們底眼睛，再也離不開店那個煙館子了。喉頭霍咯霍咯地發著響，呵欠一陣緊一陳地襲來，最後也許會倒在這煙館子門口死去了。</p>

<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>孩子們，我到一個萬花筒，就津津有味，不肯釋手的馬著玩；鄉下人，遇著人家變戲法，就站住腳跟，聚精會神的園著看。如果把萬花筒拆穿了。知道原是由幾片著色的膠片和幾塊玻璃構成的；將變戲法的道理通通弄明白，知道其中的許多變化，原不過只是手法靈巧的關係而已：萬花筒就會從孩子的手中擲掉，變戲法，也就不能再勾引得行人了。這二種東西這之所以能爲人所看重，就是靠在牠的秘密上。</p>
<p>小孩子，無論遇見什麼，都覺得樣樣好玩，鄉下佬逛都市，覺得件件事物都有趣，也就因他們不明白各種事物中的秘密的緣故。</p>
<p>一個沉默寡言的人，常常會引起人家的景仰和敬畏，他不願表露出他心中的秘密，而使人莫測的高深，說來也是一因。</p>
<p>人類之所以能世世相傳下去，永沒有倦懶和停滯，說是因爲人生原是個大謎，字宙間的秘密，是永猜不破的，也未嘗不是個道理：如果將宇宙的事事物物，都統統弄個明白，人生的究竟，都完全弄個清楚了時，或許人類就會從此絕滅，也說不定。</p>
<p>秘密的功用，是多麼值得人的讚嘆喲！</p>
<p>我們中國人，深懂得這中的道理，對於秘密的利用，說來是遠勝他人一籌的。這只要看看我們同胞一向的處事能度，不重分析，不注意羅輯，而只憑直觀推測，將事體含糊範統的混過去，就能看得出來。</p>
<p>近年來，「公開的秘密」，不是個很時新的名詞嗎？這也就是我們一部分的同胞，看準了秘密的功用的偉大處，所以才連原是公開的事體，也都使帶著一點兒秘密來。</p>
<p>不願將事體的秘密拆穿，而只做浮面的觀察，這的確是我們的聰明處：因爲能這樣，就可以省卻許多煩難，和能享受不少眼前的歡樂。但是，這麼一來，人家已進化至凌空翺翔的地步，我們還依舊停滯在以步當車的時代，這仍未免是美中不足！</p>

<p>— 雅非</p>
<p>是一個晚快，西北風是在天空中刮著，一顆打西的斜陽也給刮得失去了顏色，它彷彿似將要墜下來的樣子。</p>
<p>老桑樹上的光桿子給吹得呼呼地吼呌了起來，在週遭就找不到一隻小鳥見的影子。</p>
<p>在太湖一角的浜兜里，有一條漫長的石砌塘岸伸展著，那兒躱著好些漁船，一艘，二艘，三艘…………的，擠在一起。——嚓——嚓—嚓——磨鉤聲，和——㗭——㗭——的捄綱聲互相相的應和著。那些漁船經不起一陣陣波浪的繳盪，都像一片片樹葉兒飄在水面上船的震動，幾雙客貨船上的桅檣也跟著在空中搖曳，船夫們卻都躱在艙里。</p>
<p>「根生，今天我們得早些開船，這樣大的風，準有一番生意好做了。」桂生邊擦著鉤子，邊向著隔壁一隻船上的人說話。</p>
<p>「我想今天外湖的風太大，廟山堵不能去，還是到西灣去看看勢頭，你今天自灣自去是不礙的。」根生拍著潮煙，望望天，有經騐的回答。</p>
<p>「是呀，那里幾墩魚窩，自從扦——之後到如今，連血本還沒有撈回來咧！」</p>
<p>「一年大水，一年旱乾，這太湖里的魚，逃的逃，捉的捉，說不定，不上二三年恐怕連魚秧都要捕光啦！今年真該死，去年冬季里的漁稅還欠著，冬天脈雪不下，春雪偏會落個不停，望得見又不是個好年頭！咳！」</p>
<p>「老天爺要和咱窮人開玩笑，沒有辦法，我們還要活命，除了這條破漁船和那個綱兜兒，也找不出第二條生路來，況且我是明天的早飯米還在鉤子上，今晚還是早些吃了晚飯，開出去碰碰額角頭看！」桂生說完了話，便低頭磨他的鉤子。</p>
<p>兩個人都許久沒有話語，除了嚓嚓的磨鉤聲，和㗭㗭的捄綱聲，及呼呼的朔風聲外，一切都歸於沈寂，沉寂得像死一般。</p>
<p>黑夜爬進了人間，整個的大自然里，全給黑暗統治了；天空中沒有月亮，也沒有星光，可是風經剛才刮得更猖厥了。</p>
<p>那個浜兜里泊著的漁船，一條都不見了，在那漆黑的湖面上，卻出現著點點的漁火，在一掀一聳的搖幌。</p>
<p>那時，桂生蹲在頭船上，用著一雙熟練，而有經騐的夜眼，探視著水花的動靜。他卻屏息著，連氣都沒勁兒透一下。搖船梢的那小子卻始終遵從著桂生的指揮，在退梢一櫓，板梢一櫓的蕩著。因爲身上那襲破絮襖不夠擋寒了，所以身子是只像節糠一般的哆嗦。</p>
<p>沿著牙山一個弧形的灣兜里搖去，大龍頭，小龍頭的山影，隱約還看得出。桂生緊緊的把綱索收住了，身子也不由得瑟瑟的打戰。浪頭撞著船身，激得那隻小船髣髴似受驚的牲口般奔騰暴跳，幾乎直把桂生從船頭上震了下來。</p>
<p>「媽的，風大猛，抖不住，沒有希望啦！」他倒抽了口冷氣！</p>
<p>一串串的水珠子飛在他破氈帽的邊緣，結成了一根根的冰條，就是他那件破棉襖上，也粘滿了冰點子，他已不能再在這樣的冷風里掙扎了；全身的血液都冰了起來，手足全失了知覺。他忙把綱兒扯了起來，摔進了船里，那麼沉重的；可是那「啪噠」！的聲音不像是魚兒。他檢點了一下，見綱索上掛著一塊塊的冰片，明亮晃晃的。魚兒卻有一條，準有三兩多重。收起弋鉤來看看，倒弋著一根小鰟鮍，足足有冬青葉子那麼大。他嘆了一口氣，沒有說話；搖船的小子，無力地把船搖進了浜兜里，但天已作魚肚色了！</p>
<h3 id="c219">玄武湖之冬 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 縱心</p>
<p>石頭城，從前是六朝金粉的江南勝地，現在是京都。在人們的憧憬裹，那兒有秀麗的山水風景。有馳名的古跡。該到南京去玩一趟呵！</p>
<p>在大都市過著流浪生活的人，機器的輾動聲，汽車的煤氣，都已感到分外厭倦，拖著千斤重的生活的十字架的灰色的人生，更是想逃到清秀的山上，水邊，去散散悶吧。那麼，石頭城的城頭，就好像在我的腦子的內幌動了。</p>
<p>抱著一顆跳躍的心，給像疾爬長蛇的火車，截進石頭城下，蕭索的城邊城內的山堆，古舊的城牆，雖然是漠然，倒也有點高嚝的氣慨。這便是駛名的石頭城下呢！</p>
<p>但是，住到城內，就覺得：比上海是冷落外，也並沒有什麼可稍散心悶的景色。那麼平庸，殘留　　厚的老中　的情調。</p>
<p>到第一公園去，無意的走過一條像屎溝的城河邊，朋友指著底下的黑水說：「這便是秦淮河啦」！真有點吃了一驚：「這便是那美麗迷人的秦淮河嗎？」呵沒有什麼可人的歌聲，河邊一些小船兒，靜靜的躺著，隱約的閃著一些襤褸的人影而已。</p>
<p>不大起勁了，遊玩名城的心。悶在朋友的家裹，怪無聊賴的。想起了讀過什麼玄武之秋的文章似的，便惹起了興趣，到玄武湖去。現在是冬蝅，玄武湖　　　　個容資呢！</p>
<p>到了玄武門邊，仰看著高巍的城頭，心裹未免就有些跳動起來。秀美的玄胡喲同，一個惟悴枯響的人的心，立刻就將沉在你的懷抱裹了。我在預豐那消散無限苦惱時的歡躍的善情。我最愛湖邊那秀麗的景色呵！</p>
<p>慢慢而含著充分的恣情的神容，走出了玄武門。張眼四望，沒有葉的楊柳枯槁的垂著，和我這灰色的人的情調一樣的冷漠，我的心漸漸平沉下來。細細的打量。泥土路的兩旁盡是這些衰柳。柳下點綴著幾個擺擔子的小販，賣些花生之類。遊人是那公零落，看不到一個穿著時髪的衣裝的高貴人，只有幾個過路人吧！</p>
<p>朝著玄武門的小山堆展開東面前，幾間佩矮的房子散佈著，那麼荒涼沉靜，朋友揚手指著說：「我常幻想到這兒租間小房子住，不過，實在冷落得太冷落了！」</p>
<p>我望著不是碧緣的城下的湖水，湖上的灰黑的葉子四處浮著。有點凝住了，並沒有明顯的，自已想：這便是玄武湖呢！只是一片模糊的冷感吧了。但我還想從這荒涼冷落的玄武豢邊，尋出些可以散心的景物。朝幾正在指手說。你不知道，玄武湖確是有牠的妙處，可惜現在是冬天「春夏秋的時候，兩旁的楊柳青青，那麼飄逸的垂著，湖上盡是一些荷花蓮花開著，盪舟湖上，遊人三兩，也怪有意趣呢」！</p>
<p>但現在湖上只是滿湖死水，散浮著許多枯葉。一隻舟子在湖水上飄著也沒有，湖邊的舟子主人雖在招呼我們同，只要廿個銅板繞湖一週，還可以回來，我們卻沒有理合牠。</p>
<p>沿湖邊走去，冷落的心仍舊是冷落，湖上的枯葉散遍曠廣的湖面，我們只有自已談心而已，本荒涼了，回去吧！迎著玄武門進城去。我好像猶覺得還沒有到過玄武似的。名城勝也。仍是感著十分生疏呵！也全沒有遊過石頭城似的。</p>
<h3 id="c220">英雄 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 江野</p>
<p>「朋友：別哭了吧，就是死了，再過二十年後，又是一個大漢。</p>
<p>同伴們都呌他山東老鄉的老李，到底還是一個崛強的人。他被關在這木籠裹已有十幾天了，從來沒見他不快樂；終日的找著同伴們談些開心的故事，那血紅紅地臉，總是掛著一副惹人笑的顏色。現在，他給那今天早上才關進來的同伴，哭得心裹也有點難過了。他愈不耐煩，愈怕聽那抽抽搐搐地哭聲，他按住著心頭的憤火，走到那哭著的同伴的身邊，拍著肩膀的對他說著。</p>
<p>那個同伴，自從今天早上到這裹來，連一頓飯都沒吃，只是躲在那木板床上或站在木欄邊哭著。這不但使山東老鄉和全號子裹的同伴們給哭得不安，就是四面的號子裹的人，也都不耐煩起來了。本來誰不會去想起旁的事，只是整天的談笑著，可給他這一來，個個地心，都再也不能安寗了。</p>
<p>山東老鄉，他是比誰都要急，他那漲紅著的臉，是更加的紅起了來，他看到全號子裹的人都給那同伴哭壞了，他心裹就冒著火，不在自已的想著：一個人吃到了二三十歲，還像一個女人，什麼天大的事也可暗自想想，老是這樣哭，官老爺會給你出去嗎？天下真還有這種傻瓜呢！</p>
<p>山東老鄉愈想愈感到可笑，愈看那同伴的哭得厲害，就覺得自已的偉大。的確，山東老鄉他是一個英雄，他常常對著同伴們說：</p>
<p>「咱十六歲就單自一個在外面活著，什麼天大的事情都幹過，什麼快樂也都享過，就是吃苦的事，也都吃過，坐牢那還算得了什麼，就死吧！哼，咱二十年後又是活活地一條大漢，有什麼事情可怕，別把自已看得太小哩！」</p>
<p>他的這個英雄思想，這號子裹手人，幾乎誰都給他沾染上一點。他一談到他自已過去的生活，過去所幹的事情，他就會微笑起來，自從他關到這籠子裹之後，這裹的同伴個個都高興和他在一起閑談，就是那些在外面做小工的人，也都喜歡來聽他講故事。</p>
<p>可是自從今天早上，給那同伴哭得太不高興了，雖然是憤恨著那同伴不應該哭，但他的深心裹也有點難過了。他一整天的不說話了，他也不然而然地轉念著他自已的不快樂的念頭。</p>
<p>冬日的白天是顯得很短種了。一下子，天然黑起來，那同伴雖已經哭得只是鳴咽的抽搐著，但是他的心，卻是更難過了，他望著那黑壓壓地天空，發呆著。</p>
<p>當分發被條的時候，山東老鄉是一定要給那老頭子開玩笑的。可是今晚，他動也不動地坐在那角落裹沈靜著。等那老頭子走後，他搶了一條鐵板似的被，和著小廣東幾個人躺下去了。這時號子裹的人雜亂的在談笑他。卻默默地鑽在被服裹，邊呼吸都很低微。</p>
<p>他在想，想這一次是一定會沒了命了，又想起他家，老婆，兒子，還有老母親。想到了他一生，又想到了他眼前很快就會爆發了的遭遇。他心裹感到可怕，心裹變成冰樣地冷。似乎那死神的毒鞭在抽打著他那顆勇敢的雄心。</p>
<p>哭的聲音又在他的耳邊嚮著，他睜開著雙眼，惡恨恨地望著那哭的同伴。那種冰冷了的心，又狂烈地燒	著生之熱火。他知道自已不能這樣脆弱。他該做一個英雄，他高聲的著那同伴說：</p>
<p>「朋友：別哭了吧，就是死了，再過二十年又是一個大漢。」</p>
<h3 id="c221">無聊的日子 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 西蒙</p>
<p>不必是因爲鎮日價空著手空著腳，另後不勝無聊之感。無聊實在不是存在於動作上，而是存在於心靈上，再爛熟沒有的事物上，以及壓倦了的習慣上。往往在屋子裹納罕不過，就想到出去外邊溜跶溜跶，但並無一個目的地，拖著遲緩的步子，心底原已經是很覺無聊，既然出來，也便隨著腿子所立，任意跑跑，自已不知道走到什麼時候，也不知道要走到什麼地方。出來的時候，也不知道要走到什麼地主。出來的時候，尚抱著一種微薄的解悶的心思，然而走了一會兒，身已一感到有些困倦，於是很快地速那點心里亦告脫掉，祇是越覺著說不盡的無聊，幾乎無聊到連走路都懶得走了。</p>
<p>無聊時候的感覺最是細微，同時最是飄幻，這細微飄幻，完全無從用字眼兒來解說，而惟有自已深切的嘗味到。心像踏在棉花堆上遙晃著，心則如一個深邃不見底的洞，空空蕩。坐不安，臥不寗，一切都覺得枯寂，死板。什麼都不起勁。心情的惡劣是達於極點。睡在床上，想著睏一頓醒過來，或者能夠將無聊的心境驅除，可是沒中用，儘管把眼睛暗閉緊，老睡不著，於是愈煩燥了，爬上來，隨便攤開一本書翻翻，那裹看得下去，看不上幾行，又扔了，仍是無聊。任何事都引不起興趣來，無窮無盡的無聊之感，籠罩著整個的身心。越是找尋一些玩藝，來排除這無聊，便趣是無聊得利害。</p>
<p>往常很多爲自已嗜好的消遣的方法，或是對於自已有上面相當興緻的事情。然而如今亦不行了。想了起來就頭痛，那些事情已全失去平日給予我的興緻。</p>
<p>我幾乎焦急得要咕出聲來了。無聊到簡直變成一種病癥的痛楚了。裝在屋子裹，沒完沒結地踱芳步，人像是抽去了心房一樣。走了半天，如果把走過的步子一直連起來，真不知多遠。但是除了只是無限地加增無聊的重感。當忙碌著在作息的時候，天一亮，便埋首在案頭上，一天之內的事務未曾理好，一霎眼便是天暗了下來，這樣時時會不自覺對著西墮的夕陽太嘆著；時間爲什麼走得那麼快。可是無聊的時候，時間固然這是迅速地溜了過去，卻仍以爲間是走的過分遲滯了。</p>
<p>無聊的苦惱是領受夠了。倘若說所以會有無聊的之感，總是爲了飽食終日。無所事事的原故同，那可不然。每天，我應該去做的事實在多得很，只怕做不到完整，自然更沒有怎樣的閑暇。已然有了那麼多的事務紛纏著。照理該是心身繁忙不件，何以還老是嚷無聊。這就是合自已了也茫然的了。想不出一種真正的理由來，也許多分是由於事，雖則是有的，某種事原本都具有某種熱情和意味，但是日子一久，恒心便漸漸地淡了，淡下來，就要淡到完全消失，而某種事本身的意味也同樣破滅了。</p>
<h3 id="c222">敎書匠 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 江天</p>
<p>天快黑了，馬路兩帝的枯乾底樹枝給北風刮得東倒西歪的在響著。這條沉靜的惠愛東路，是更沉靜了。</p>
<p>老王手裹夾著二本敎　科書和一學生的卷子，沒精打采的在路上走著。</p>
<p>「老王：那裹去呀？今天薪水可有領到嗎？」</p>
<p>李先生在老王的背後走過來，拍著他的肩膀問，這時老王他心裹正在想著今天領薪水的事，給李先生這一問，他心裹就發著火，他睜著那圓大的眼珠，望著李先生說：</p>
<p>「老李，別提了，今天不但領不到，還受了一陣氣。他媽的，這真不是人幹的事，敎書只好餓肚皮哩！」</p>
<p>「老王難道你受氣，人家就不是一樣嗎？我也不想幹這事情了，不過……找不到別的事幹。」</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>「老朋友；你還不要緊，我才沒法呢！家裹老婆病得很危險，自已的身體也不大好，他媽的薪水卻不發，已經是欠了五個月拉！一個錢拿不到。」</p>
<p>老王一想起他的老婆，心裹更是冒著火，滿腹的憤怒使他心麻木起來。他望一望李先生，低著頭的一語不發。</p>
<p>「老朋友；別太憔心了，總算是我們倒霉了，還是找別的事情吧！這碗飯是吃得太苦了。再會吧！」</p>
<p>李先生一面說著一面向著他招招手的望一條黑暗的小弄裹走去了。老王搖搖頭嘆了一個長氣的望著家裹走去。</p>
<p>「他媽的，今天又是空手回來，老婆怎麼辦昵？」</p>
<p>老王剛跨進門，腳下似乎沒有半點的力氣的走上樓梯，心裹卻在轉著這個念頭。</p>
<p>老王跑進房裹，放下了敎科書和學生的卷子，走近他老婆的牀前，蒼白的面孔，微弱的喘息著，那雙眼睛已經是深深地陷落了，涙水似乎選掛在那深深地眼眶裹。老王這時看關他老婆的這副樣子，心裹更加的冒起憤恨的怒火，他捻著他那枯瘦地手，心裹在罵著；</p>
<p>「媽的，一切都是沒有錢才弄出來的，五個月不發薪？」</p>
<p>他老婆睜開著那深深陷落的眼睛，涙珠從那眼眶裹滾下來，望著他，很微弱幾乎是聽不見的說著，他這時聽著這話，心裹是更加的難過了，一陣悲酸悽的陰影緊蒙著他的心頭，他感呼吸的慘窒息，感到世界地一切的悲慘，是沒有這再苦的了。他這時想起了過去的黃金時代，起起了變愛的快樂，想起了死去的父母，想起了遠到南洋去敎書的弟弟，他想起了過去的一切了。眼前一陣昏暗，屋子似乎天旋地轉起來……</p>

<h3 id="c227">中國古代建築上「力」的分析 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 希浩</p>
<p>我國歷代於建築學的發揚，可謂不遣飭力，上迄秦漢，下至宋元，雄視世界的精美建築物，不斷地侭量產生，現在的通都大邑裹，還能夠找到牠們的遣跡，雖然經過了數千年或是數百年的風打雨吹，牠們卻依舊的雄偉地矗立著，我們這東方建築的堅固和耐久，就可想見了。</p>
<p>東方建築還有一個令人最滿意的地方，就是牠的「色彩」，外人名之謂「東方色彩」，牠配置的輕巧和得宜，世界上任何建築物都不能比擬牠，我們可以從歷代遣下的宮殿和廟宇上觀察出來。</p>
<p>我們古代的建築既如是精美和堅固，爲什麼我們現在漸漸的在不注意牠，而努力的採用西法呢，這其中實在有大大的問題——就是「力」的問題。</p>
<p>我們假使靜心地用科學的眼光去觀察現在存在的古代宮廟的結構，我們就可發現每根柱子和樑所受的力，都是「壓縮力」，因爲從前我們還沒有把鋼鐵做建築材料，所以所用的木料非常的粗大，使整個建築堅固，房屋愈堅固，用的森料愈粗大，這樣一來，每根木料所受的「壓縮力」，就大大的增加，這種巨大的壓縮力，使一般的建築僅能作橫的發展，而不允許作縱的發展，所以，大半我國的古代建築物，儘多著寛廣的廳庭堂奧，鳳有上矗數十層的高樓，這種建築物，處現在尺土千金的二十世紀都市，是絕對不會存在的。</p>
<p>現在建築的結構，不僅在有壓縮力，同時要有引伸力和其他的力同，有時數種的力混在一起，結果互相消失，這樣一來，每單位所能受的力要增加，建築的層數就可儘量的增加，不看現代的輕巧的鋼架，雄偉地支持著幾十層的水泥建築物，而沒有絲毫危險，這就因爲能夠妙用其「力」的結果。</p>
<p>古代的建築匠，對於伸力的採用，似乎沒有注意到，其實木料的引伸力，極其低弱，即使採用，也不免有斷裂的危險！</p>
<p>除掉上述木料所受的壓縮力外，古代建築每一塊方磚都受著巨大的壓縮力，整個築物的支撐，牠們都負有相當的責任，這樣一來，因著磚塊重量的增加，使多層築物的建造受到妨害，這也是古代建築的另一個致命傷。</p>
<p>總之，我國古代建築上對於「力」的分配，未能巧妙地應用，這也是牠們日趨衰落的主要原因吧！</p>

<p>— 楊德惠</p>
<p>法租界呢，去年十月個的建築總值，爲一○·八四一·○○○元，在一二兩月份裹建築的蓬勃，真是無以復加，較之二十二年同一時期，幾乎加增三倍；計一月份九二五○○○元，二月份一·○四五·○○○元，而其建築物大半是偉大工程的公寓，所以，有這樣的價值。尤其是貝當路汶林路轉角的十四層公寓，價值在數百萬元，其他八九層的建築，也有數處；三月份建築值二百九十二萬四千元，四月份一百三十六萬一千元，五月份是比較跌落了，祇值七十七萬一千元，六月份八○五一五○元，在這六個月裹，共計七百八十三萬一千一百五十元，雖然五六兩月的低落，但較之二十二年同時期內，則增加百分之十九十，倘使把建築物分類來說。那末，公寓有二十五所，洋房一百三十三宅，半西式廳屋四十八宅，華式住廳三百二十四幢，店面八十三間，工廠七所，學校四所，其他建築四十八起。七月份和和月份的建築總數。計有二百四十五萬元，在這兩月裹，正是亢熱的天氣，而建築的價值，有這樣的較五六兩月的增加，這是可見的法租界近年來建築的勃興象徵，計營造洋廳，七十二宅，半西式廳屋八十間，華式住廳六十四幢，就中工程宏大的爲法巡捕廳值十五萬元，和醫院二所，共值五十餘萬元，倘若把這八個月裹建築價值平均起來，每月爲一百二十五萬元左右·但至九月份，卻暴縮至三十八萬三千元了，十月份又再縮至十七萬六千五百元·這是並非可驚的事實。我們知道人口和建築，原有連鎖性的。去年法租界的人口，僅增加至百分之○·三三，比較民二十和民二十一年增加百分之四·九四，二十一年和二十二年百分之三·七五，相差達十倍呢！因爲是這樣，所以法租界去年的建築，除偉大的公寓建築外，其他的華式住房，多是由舊廳屋的翻造。我們可看得其西區一帶，都是高大的公寓建築，就明白了法租界近年來的建築趨向了。這種公寓建築，在上海，是適合一般的屋住者的需要，所以，很發達地的建築，也可說是田園都市的憧憬呢（未完）</p>
<h3 id="c229">鋼與其保護方法（下） <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 欽</p>
<p>爲滿足第一之要素，建築家曾用一種鋼料，名之曰「金屬的木材」，乃以平鋼片或鋼條經過冷碾或彎曲而成，其建築上之力量頗大。其用如作間柱，鑲板，之類。並且凸緣以增力量，近來之改良頗多。關於接合，可分二點：一爲鋼料與鋼料之接合：二爲鋼料與其他物體之接合。普通鋼之間的接合均用煆合法，或爲火花式，或爲電阻式，以及其他各種煆合方法。鋼與其他物體之接合，每以其物體之不同而不同，工程家之研究結果亦各有改進，各有差異之處，其種類焉能屈指而計。至於耐久性，則證之以往事實及試騐所得，鋼之耐久，高出於其他建築材料。在乾燥之空氣中，鋼能保持原狀至無窮盡期。即在普通情形下欲其維持至三四十年，亦可以不成問題。然而混之攻擊與夫化學物品如酸類蒸氣之侵蝕。則容易減短其壽命</p>
<p>鋼片之保護方法，在建築上普通有三種：</p>
<p>（一）油漆保護層　我人若置鋼於乾燥之空氣中，則其質地雖經百年而不變，堅固猶如初時，其故蓋以鋼之表面，其自身已經和空氣中之養氣化合而成一極薄層之養化物，防止此後之養化。然而在尋常情況下，我人不得不施之以漆，保護其表面，使不與水汽或其他有害物質之相接觸。紅鉛漆之效力極佳，其他之油漆如以鋅之養化物，鉛興銘之化合物，白鉛，青鉛，等作填料者皆可用之。施漆之前，須先滌去鋼面上之塵污，使之乾燥，然後塗之以漆用刷帚或用噴射方法均可。據美國建築家試騐之結果，塗以紅鉛漆之鋼片，在三十五年後，仍完好如初。可見鋼之保護得法，其耐久性極大，平時缺裂處或油漆剝落處之應即修理，自屬重要。此油漆保護方法普通多用之。</p>
<p>（二）塗磁保護層　鋼面塗磁之光，首有鍍鋅之方法。其後歐洲人利用磁面以保護鋼鐵，其法甚善，於是美國人近亦起而效尤。塗磁之優點有幾端，第一爲其顏色之可以任意配合，第二爲耐久性，第三爲其易於清潔。塗磁　方法即以磁質流液，塗於鋼面上，溫度在華氏三千度左右。磁質中包含砂與硼二物質爲最多，故其質地堅固，能防止一切水汽與酸類之侵蝕。磁質附貼於鋼面，其黏力極大，直至鋼之力量不勝時方與之俱敗。塗磁鋼片適宜於屋外及內部之貼邊裝飾，能加以紫銅之接合處裝飾者更可以爲之生色之生色。</p>
<p>（三）樹脂保護層　樹脂乃由人工製造，溶解於適當深液中，內加不透光之填料，然後塗之於鋼面。此種保護層大概用於需要甚殷，須立時乾燥者。其耐久性甚強，即在汽車上，用具上，以及汽車加油站上等亦都用之，不過其價格間似較其他兩種爲貴。</p>
<p>鋼片除施以保護層者而外，更有母須保護著，此即我人平日所稱之不銹鋼是也。不銹鋼中以含有少量之鉻質，故在平常情形下，共表面生有一層極薄極薄之化合物保護層，但仍不失其原來之光彩，故名之曰不銹鋼。不銹鍘於近年來爲用日廣，在建築上亦有非常之潛勢力。蓋藉其堅強之力量與不銹之特點，於建築土正可以完成工程與美術兩大使命，此歐美建築家之所以樂於應用也。其用凡鋼板，鋼片，鋼條，鋼管，鋼絲，鋼釘，鏞鑄模型等，無不相宜。其未來之發展實未可限量也。</p>

<h3 id="c232">大嘴巴笑匠佐意勃郎的拉雜談 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 西林</p>
<p>大嘴巴佐意勃郎（Joe　e　Brown）敢大的本領，就是逗人發笑，但是他亦有正經的時候，那就是好萊塢一家電影雜誌請他做一天的名譽主筆，坐在主筆，坐在主筆先生寫字檯上的時候。他正正經經的寫了如下的一篇大文章，亦可以算是一篇社論，裏面所説的話，雖然是拉拉雜雜的，却亦還有些道理。所以我就將它譯了出來：</p>
<p>第一點他論到的是：「明星的天職」。他説：「電影明星們常常談論着，他們對於一般形迷在藝術方面的義務——怎樣使他們的作品推持」定相當的水凖。好極了！但是照我的見解，還有一件同等要緊的事，就是他們要記住，他們對於一般崇拜羡慕他們的社會人士，在道德上，亦負有相當的責任。那就是説他們的行爲及私人事務，在一般社會人士的心上，要有一種向上提高的力量。</p>
<p>「在這點上，我並不是説凡是做電影明星的，一定要終日扳起了道學面孔，言笑不苟，。我亦不是説他們一定要天天早起唱聖詩，吃飯以前禱告祝福。但是我却以爲他們在個人道德方面，以及在公衆塲所的一舉一動，都要十分小心，要做社會上的一個榜樣。簡單的説，我相信一個電影明星，有誘掖向上的力量，但亦有影響下流的力量。我自己有子女，或者我對於這個問題，看得過於嚴重些，但是我覺得凡是做電影明星，既在社會公衆的心目中佔有重要的地位，都應具有這種觀念。」</p>
<p>第二點佐意勃郎提到的，就是：「明星難欺瞞」。他説：「當一般普通人，聽到好萊塢的生活，怎樣怎樣浪漫的時候，他們應記住：明星瞞不過開末拉的。情慾之事和失眠，總會顯露在他們的臉上，而無可隱秘的。攝影工作九點鐘開台。他們早上六點半必須起床。如果下午六點鐘能散塲，那就是他們的運氣。散塲之後，缷妝更衣，至少還要一個鐘頭。所以他們回到家裏吃晚飯，至早下午七點鐘。吃完晚飯，還有許多爲明天工作，必須凖備的事要做。倘使他們再要睡眠七八個鐘頭，他們在事實上，簡直就没有可以荒唐之餘地了。總而言之，好萊塢不是一個荒唐者久居之地。要久居好萊塢，他們就無法荒唐。請你們不要相信外面的謡言吧！</p>
<p>第三點是：「好萊塢的小孩子」。他説：「好萊塢的小孩子，是很有幸福的。這不是説他們的你母賺錢多，使他們有最高尚的飲食起居和教育。實在是因爲一般影界人物，教養他們子女的方法，是很良善而值得稱讚的。現在齊集在好萊塢的，那是一般很高尚的士女，將來他們的後輩長成的時候，一定不會塌他們父母的台的。但是有一件事。我希望將來好萊塢不要發達得太大了，以致没有小孩子玩耍的空地。小孩子是不能永遠在花園裏玩的，他們要有極大的空地，可以掘掘地窟，扮扮紅人。空地是任何社會所必須有的。好萊塢的空地，已經漸漸覺得不够起來了。</p>
<p>第四點他説的是：「好萊塢變換了」。他説：「好萊塢變換了，從這耶穌聖誕節的禮物上，就可以看得出來的　從前好萊塢每逢耶誕節，大家你送給我，我送給你的，不是金鋼鑽的，就是白金的　明　們送給導演先生的，都是新的跑車，和方切的寶石。佈景師和燈光師等，要是到了耶穌誕日，没有收到三四隻手錶，地就知道不興了。記錄女子普通所收到的，至少一套書，否則　是一篇的銀器。大家都用頂貴重的禮物，來表示相念之意。</p>
<p>「但是今年不然了！差不多每一個人，都要用些腦筋，採辦些合理的東西，並且買得很少很少。如果他們有多餘的錢，他們還要買些日用的東西，發散給窮人。好萊塢在這一點上，實在長進了不少知識見解，都是不景氣所賜給的教訓也」。</p>
<p>佐意勃郎去年曾到過上海。他對於中國的感想，亦在他所作的論文中提到。他説：「我到了中國，我覺得一個電影明星，並不是什麽了不起的大人物。但是我却享受了些更大的自由，因爲他們中國人，並不追在明星們後面，求他們簽字的，雖然他們很喜歡和明星們接觸談話。我很喜歡中國人，因爲我相信他們友善的態度，是很眞誠的」。</p>

<p>— 雪梅</p>
<p>强尼拉米立斯説完了話之後，那五人之中的領袖就開口道：「却利，這話是你説的，還是這傢伙説的？怎麽你自己不會説話，要叫人家替你説？你當着我們的話，是和你開玩笑嗎？我們買了那塊地，你就後悔不及了。」却利還没有開口，强尼已經搶着説道：「當然你們不是開玩笑。我們亦希望你不要開玩笑。因爲倘使你要買那塊地，你還要從我們手裏買過來哩。」那人道：「你説的什麽話，我聽不懂。」强尼道：「我説的，就是我們對於那塊地有購買的優先權。你要知道，我們幾個月之前，早已知道了你們的詭計，早已凖備好了。」</p>
<p>强尼説完了，走了出去，還是笑着。那些人一言不發地坐着。最後，一個人發言道：「這人你從那裏請來的？」却利路克已經恢復了原狀，笑着説道：「眞聰明，是不是？朋友們，我告訴你，這就是我的秘訣，要能用人，要聰明人都來歸我。他六個月之前來到我這裏，本來是窮極無聊的，來找事做。他碰見了卜去安得羅斯，我的拳師，一條力大無比的蠻牛。卜去安得羅斯問他道：「傻瓜，你能做什麽事？」强尼不慌不忙地説道：「飯桶，你能做什麽，我能做什麽。」卜去宏得羅斯聽了，狂吼一聲，像獅子似的奔向强尼。那就是卜去安得羅斯所能記得的一切，我恐怕……等到他過了一個鐘頭，他悠然蘇醒過來的時候，他的鼻子都彎了，他的位置亦没有了。」</p>
<p>那人道：「你將卜去安得羅斯攆走了嗎？」却利道：「當然，我最喜歡的就是勝利者。」他頓了一頓又説道：「我們儘着坐在這裏做什麽？你不到外面去喝杯酒去呢？」他們於是走到外面，五彩燈光之下，賭台上的喧嘩，銀錢丁當之聲，閙成一片。却利路克不覺高興以來。這時路克的老婆，正從外面走了進來。他的老婆，曼麗路克，是墨克西加里城中，衣着最時髦的女子。她的頭髮是金黄色的。她的身段是富有肉感，帶着曲線美的。她還有一副驕矜及富有誘惑性的眼睛。</p>
<p>路克看見她進來，連忙迎了上去道：「寶貝，你怎麽上這這裏來了？」曼麗無精打彩地答應道：「你覺得稀奇嗎？」好的一雙眼睛，不覺溜到强尼拉米立斯身上。路克道：「稀奇倒没有什麽稀奇，但是，我的小妹妹，我不喜歡你到這種地方來。你知道，這不是女人應當到的地方。」他的小妹妹説道：「我不能一天到晚，一晚到天亮，總耽在家裏。我亦要出來尋些開心。在家裏叫我做些什麽？喂金魚？但是金魚一天亦祇吃一頓飯……」路克陪笑道：「乖乖的，不要閙，快回家去……我今天早些回來。」他回過頭喊着强尼道：「强尼，你送太太回家去。」</p>
<p>强尼於是陪着老闆娘，從許多酒檯之間，走了出去。他們走出了大門。强尼一言不發地替她開着門。他們走到了街上。曼麗就將兩臂勾住了强尼的頸，吻了他一下。一個很迅速而熱烈的吻。她吻完了，就自己跳上了汽車，哈哈大笑着開走了。强尼呆呆地站在路旁。他未免有些感觸，但是他却不得不小心謹慎些。他犯不上和曼麗路克發生關係，因爲他還有更重要的事情，在今天晚上要辦妥的。（未完）</p>

<p>At the Central National Government's Bi-Weekly Memorial Service</p>
<p>Practicing a Scientific and Rationalized Life</p>
<p>Is the Only Way to Achieve National Rejuvenation</p>
<p>[Nanjing] At 9 a.m. on the 18th, the Central Government held its bi-weekly memorial service. Approximately 600 people attended, including Central Committee members Ju Zheng, Wang Zhaoming, Deng Jiayan, Ding Chaowu, Li Zonghuang, Li Ciwen, Wang Qi, Zeng Zhongming, Xiao Zhongzhen, Ji Liang, and other staff. Chairman Wang Zhaoming presided over the ceremony and delivered a report, stating that the following day would mark the first anniversary of the New Life Movement. He explained that human survival relies on two forces: one is the individual's autonomous and self-motivated power, and the other is the collective's mutually supporting and encouraging power. Based on these two forces, humanity can evolve and develop a disciplined and orderly life. Otherwise, various forms of sanctions will be imposed, which can be divided into national sanctions (political and legal) and social sanctions (social and moral). The New Life Movement aims to cultivate a strong social sanction force outside of legal life, establish common creeds or directions for all aspects of life and action, and guide people toward improvement and national rejuvenation. However, some people doubt whether the New Life Movement, unable to use political and legal means to interfere in people's daily lives and relying solely on persuasion, will become a mere formality without any real effect. This doubt stems from a lack of understanding of the power of social sanctions. Although social sanctions may not be as obvious or rigorous as legal power, they are highly effective. For example, the prevalence of foot-binding across the country was due to social forces. On the other hand, the Qing dynasty's forced adoption of the queue hairstyle disappeared after the dynasty's demise. This proves that the New Life Movement, using social sanctions, can be effective. Rejuvenating the nation requires reforming the people's mindset. The New Life Movement uses the power of social sanctions to cultivate a new spirit and actions among the people, transforming old customs into a scientific and rationalized life. He hoped that everyone would work hard, knowing that the success of the New Life Movement is the success of the Chinese nation's rejuvenation. The meeting adjourned at 10 a.m. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] The National Government held a memorial service on the morning of the 18th. Over 500 people attended, including Zhao Yongjian, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Xunyong, Wang Yongbin, Chen Shuren, Cao Haosen, Chen Daqi, Lin Xiang, Chen Jiliang, Chen Qicai, and staff from various ministries and departments. After Chairman Lin led the ceremony, Tan Zhen, the Vice President of the Judicial Yuan, delivered a report. He stated that since the promotion of the New Life Movement, people across the country have paid close attention. Now that a year has passed, reviewing the situation and the work done, it is deeply felt that this movement is of great importance to the future of our nation's rejuvenation. The significance of the New Life Movement can be summarized by the four words of clothing, food, housing, and transportation in practical life. At the same time, it should also focus on the spiritual virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor. The concise meaning of the New Life Movement lies in how to seek to conform to the spiritual virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor, which are the crystallization of Eastern culture and the inherent characteristics of our nation, in all aspects of our daily life, both practically and spiritually. Now that the country and the nation are showing signs of decline, the slogan of the New Life Movement is proposed during this time of national crisis, and its significance is even greater. This movement is the general mobilization for our nation's rejuvenation. All Chinese people should have this deep belief in their minds and recognize the inherent spiritual culture of our country, the four virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and honor, as our spiritual national defense. This kind of national defense can never be invaded by external forces, which is very evident in history. We should fully express this spirit, and in addition to the unity of the nation, we should also fully cultivate our nation's fundamental filial piety and family system, in order to rejuvenate our nation.

<p>The Issue of Cadre Personnel</p>
<p>The Academic Community Holds an Important Position</p>
<p>[Nanchang] The New Life Movement General Association held a full executive committee meeting on the morning of the 18th. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, as well as Xiong Shihui, Yang Yongtai, Yan Baohang, Fan Zhengbo, and others attended. Xiong Shihui reported on the work done in the past month. Chairman Chiang then gave a speech, the gist of which is as follows: Regarding the future work of the New Life Movement, one point needs special attention from everyone, namely the issue of cadre personnel. Party, government, military, and academic circles should all participate as promoters, but especially the academic community should hold the most important position. Not only should students participate, but also principals, teachers, and staff should automatically participate in the work and jointly shoulder the responsibility of national rejuvenation. Young people have plenty of energy, enthusiasm, and vigor, and they are the center of the leadership force. They are practical in their work. We should not only use slogans, but more importantly, earnestly promote the spirit of labor and service to make it a prevailing trend. In this work, the position of teachers and staff is particularly important. They should lead by example and be role models for young students. The government and principals should encourage and urge them to conduct a general review every month to promote the effectiveness of the work. Currently, many teachers and staff cannot shoulder this heavy burden, but they must learn and strive to learn. Principals must lead by example and urge teachers and staff to improve so that they can be models for students. This is just one personal opinion, and I hope everyone can come up with more concrete methods. Regarding labor service, I have already explained it in the memorial service and have written the organizational goals and other items of the Labor Service Corps for everyone's reference. After the speech, discussions began and several important cases were resolved. (Central News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>[Zhenjiang] The Jiangsu Agricultural Technology Discussion Conference opened at 2 p.m. on the 18th. More than 70 representatives attended. Chairman Shen Baixian reported on the purpose of the conference, which was threefold: (1) Jiangsu Province suffered from a major flood in 1931 and a severe drought last year, resulting in losses of 400 million yuan. Therefore, the resolution was to first complete water conservancy projects and then improve agricultural affairs. (2) In the past, the promotion of agricultural affairs had little effect. The aim this time is to gain references from various provinces and instructions from central experts. (3) Jiangsu Province is a planned development and reclamation area, and it is urgent to discuss where to start and to obtain practical methods as goals for work. Luo Shishi, on behalf of Chairman Chen, delivered a speech, expressing regret that the chairman was unable to attend due to a cold. He went on to say that China has a history of agricultural research for decades, and there must be many gains, but this is not the case in reality. The reasons for this are: (1) Academic theories are not fully compatible with experience and cannot be trusted by ordinary farmers. (2) Foreign technologies may not be entirely effective because the environment and geology are different from ours. (3) In the past, agricultural education institutions were still isolated from farmers and failed to become one with them. In the future, we should work practically. Experts Liu Xinglang and Zeng Jikuan then gave speeches. The ceremony was completed, and technical discussions will be held from the 19th to the 24th. (Special dispatch on the 18th)</p>

<p>The United States is Studying Ways to Resolve the Silver Problem</p>
<p>The Revised Sino-American Commercial Treaty Has Not Yet Received Instructions</p>
<p>[Nanjing] American Ambassador Johnson, who took leave to return to the United States last June, arrived in Nanjing on the evening of the 17th. On the 18th, Mr. Johnson stated that he was in the United States for about three months, spending the most time in Washington. He also visited New York and various rural areas. Due to the economic recession in recent years, the country has been spending huge sums of money annually for relief. This time, he visited various villages, from the west to the east, and each village had signs of "work-for-relief" to repair various tree beams and roads. The unemployment problem is gradually being solved. Both in cities and villages, there is a gradual sense of prosperity compared to before. In general, the economy of our country is gradually showing signs of recovery. It is expected that the atmosphere of the past recession will be swept away this autumn. A reporter inquired about the revision of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty. The Ambassador had previously indicated when he returned to the United States that he would proceed after seeking instructions. What is the current situation? Johnson replied that there has been no progress in revising the Sino-American Commercial Treaty of 1903. He has not received any instructions to proceed with this matter, so it is difficult to answer at this time. When asked about the issue of the Embassy moving south, he said that the American Embassy in Nanjing has an office, and Consul General Peck is his representative. He also comes to Nanjing often, which can be considered as the Embassy being in Nanjing. As for the Embassy in Beijing, there is currently no intention to move it. Finally, someone inquired about the opinion of the Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Johnson replied that he only saw it in the newspaper and did not know the actual situation. He had not heard about the government's opinion on this issue when he was in the United States. He dared not express any opinions on this issue in his official capacity and could not express any opinions. (Special dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] American Ambassador Johnson arrived in Nanjing on the evening of the 17th. On the morning of the 18th, at 11 o'clock, he met with reporters at the American Consulate General and spoke freely about the American economic situation and the silver issue. According to him, the American economy has been greatly affected by the global economic recession in the past three years and has been very sluggish. Most people are unemployed, and all construction cannot be completed. Recently, the American government has been trying its best to revitalize the national economy and is using the method of "work-for-relief" to carry out various constructions. Regarding the silver issue, the American government and public are currently studying a proper solution. When he passed through New York, economic figures were holding meetings to discuss this issue. The American government is now solving domestic problems, which inevitably affects other parts of the world, but the American government does not want to benefit itself and affect other countries. However, there is a solution for the agricultural industry, namely, currency inflation, to raise prices, and the government will try to help without affecting the interests of other countries. A reporter asked whether the United States had recently changed its silver purchasing policy. He replied that the American government has various difficulties in this regard because it must take into account the domestic situation, but it cannot ignore the foreign environment. A reporter asked whether the implementation of the silver policy was due to the silver group and the representatives of various states considering the interests of the silver-producing states. He said that although the representatives of the silver-producing states are considering their interests, the representatives of the agricultural states in the western United States are also standing in the same position because they want to raise prices and obtain relief. Therefore, the American government must take into account the political power of both sides. Finally, the reporter said that the American silver policy has greatly affected China's economy, and it is hoped that the United States will find a solution to this matter as soon as possible. Ambassador Johnson replied that Roosevelt and his advisors are indeed trying their best to carefully consider a proper solution to avoid affecting the Far East, but they have not yet found a better way. However, this was the situation two months ago when he passed through Washington. He did not know what the recent situation was. He then spoke about the revision of the Sino-American Commercial Treaty. Johnson said that he had not yet received instructions from the government. The American Embassy also has no intention of moving to Nanjing recently because the Consulate General in Nanjing is the Embassy's office in Nanjing. The upgrading of the Sino-American diplomatic missions has not been discussed in Washington. Finally, Johnson said regarding the recent situation in the Far East that the United States sincerely hopes that all countries can be friendly with each other. (Central News Agency dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>[Nanjing] After arriving in Nanjing, American Ambassador Johnson sent a letter from the American Consulate General in Nanjing to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs on the 18th to request a meeting with the Vice Minister. It is reported that Xu Mo has scheduled a meeting for 10 a.m. on the 20th. The date for the meeting with Minister Wang has not yet been determined.

<h3 id="e52">First Anniversary of the New Life Movement <a href="#e52" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c52" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">52</a></h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>It has been a year since Generalissimo Chiang delivered a speech at the expanded memorial week in Nanchang on this day last year, advocating the New Life Movement. This New Life Movement, which aims to revitalize the nation and is based on raising the knowledge and morality of the people, has swept the country for a year. The extent of its growth and development is what the people of the country should pay attention to today.</p>
<p>In order to enable the people of the country to understand the progress of the New Life Movement over the past year, this newspaper's yearbook has specially invited Mr. Zhang Xiaotong, who is very knowledgeable in this field, to make a detailed record. The main points are excerpted as follows: (1) Since its inception in Nanchang, it has been followed by 21 provinces and regions under the leadership of Generalissimo Chiang, including the capital Nanjing, Shanghai, Beijing, and major cities, as well as Jiangsu, Hebei, Hubei, Fujian, Anhui, Henan, Zhejiang, Hunan, Shandong, Shanxi, Shaanxi, Gansu, Chahar, Suiyuan, Ningxia, Qinghai, Sichuan, Guizhou, Yunnan, and Kangding. Of the 28 provinces and regions in the country, the four northeastern provinces are in the midst of being occupied, and Xinjiang is isolated. Therefore, apart from Guangdong and Guangxi, the movement has achieved widespread success. (2) Starting in July last year, the National New Life Movement was changed from being promoted by the Promotion Association to being guided by the General Association. Not only are the steps unified, but the work has also progressed from propaganda to practical action. (3) The initial stage of the New Life Movement requires achieving six items: neatness, cleanliness, simplicity, frugality, speed, and certainty. By the end of 1934, the initial stage of "orderliness" and "cleanliness" had come to an end and entered a further stage of militarizing, industrializing, and artisticizing life.</p>
<p>In summary, the achievements of the New Life Movement over the past year are clearly visible. Let's further examine its content. In the "Outline of the New Life Movement," there is an explanation of this:</p>
<p>The New Life Movement is to promote "a disciplined life of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame." The virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are practiced in daily life - in the four things of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the center of rules for developing people's virtue to accomplish people's work, for treating people, handling affairs, maintaining oneself, and dealing with things.</p>
<p>When the people of the country read these few words, it is not difficult to get a concrete idea of ​​the content of the new life. In other words, this is actually a movement to rationalize life. If the lives of the 470 million people in the country can gradually tend to be rationalized, then the corrupt will be honest, the weak will be strong, the people's virtue will be shown daily, and the people's strength will be increased daily. The goal of revitalizing the nation may be achieved. However, this requires the people of the country to thoroughly realize the unreasonable accumulated life. Every citizen starts from themselves, washing away the filth and dirt. The focus of the effort is entirely on the word "do."</p>
<p>Generalissimo Chiang said in his speech on this day last year: "...The purpose of the New Life Movement is to thoroughly militarize the lives of all the people in the country... I hope that everyone will make a decision to die yesterday and be born today, and thoroughly reform all the barbaric lives of the past that were not suitable for modernization. Everything new life, new movement, new career, all start from today..." Rerecord this statement to encourage the people of the country and to replace the congratulatory message on the anniversary.</p>
<h3 id="e53">The Japanese-Puppet Regime's New Regulations on Banning Chinese Laborers from Entering 関 Are Implemented Tomorrow <a href="#e53" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c53" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">53</a></h3>
<p>[Dalian] The puppet organization is scheduled to implement the "Regulations on the Control of Foreign Laborers" on the 20th of this month. The Japanese authorities in the Kwantung Leased Territory are also scheduled to implement the "Regulations on Foreign Laborers" on the same day. The purpose is to prevent workers from 関内 (China proper, south of the Great Wall) from seeking work in the Northeast. According to Japanese investigations, the number of North China workers who went to 関外 (the Northeast, north of the Great Wall) in the spring and returned to their hometowns in the autumn each year peaked at 1.13 million in 1928. After the September 18th Incident, it has seen a sharp decrease, but there were still more than 570,000 people last year. The amount of money that workers bring back or remit to 関内 each year averages more than 20 million yuan. At the same time, it has caused the inflow of puppet currency into 関内, and Japan has also suffered great losses as a result. Therefore, regulations have been promulgated to only allow workers with specialized skills to enter 関, and it is planned to set up control agencies in Dalian, Yingkou, Andong, Shanhaiguan, Gubeikou, and Xifengkou.

The mine was originally operated by Chinese people on a small scale. After the company tested the mine, it believed that the amount of gold buried was as high as 200 million yuan. Therefore, it forcibly took over with a small amount of capital and decided to transport machinery and start gold mining recently. (Hualian Telegram, 18th)</p>

<p>Messina Has Become a Large Military Camp</p>
<p>Troops Depart Singing War Songs</p>
<p>The African war seems difficult to avoid. Today, three battalions of the fascist militia and the 3rd Regiment of the Guerro di Lorena Division, totaling 3,000 men, embarked on the transport ship Bianco Mano Boro bound for North Africa. Messina has now become a large military camp. Young people from all over arrive by train every day. They are eager to go to Africa to protect Italian interests. It is not yet known how many troops the Italian authorities will send, but if the number sent is still considered small, there are many troops in Messina. They can depart as soon as they receive orders. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>Two thousand Italian soldiers from Naples embarked on the Italian ship Ganges today, bound for Italian Somaliland in Africa. They are expected to arrive at their destination on February 24. All schools have been closed so that students can see the soldiers marching through the city. The streets were crowded with onlookers. General Ferrucci, the deputy commander of the Italian National Militia, inspected the troops before their departure. When the troops passed in front of him, they all raised their hands in salute. As the Ganges departed, all the churches rang their bells and all the ships in the port sounded their horns to show their farewells. (Reuters Dispatch, 18th)</p>
<p>The Italian transport ship Ganges departed from the port of Naples at noon today, carrying two battalions of the Fascist Party army, bound for Massawa in Italian Eritrea, Africa. Many other officers also departed on the ship. At the time of departure, all ships in the port hung flags to celebrate, and the whistles sounded in unison. The masses on the scene cheered enthusiastically, and colorful banners were hung everywhere in the city, with posters in the three colors of the national flag pasted on the walls. Also, because the schools were closed, there were many young children mixed in the crowd. The two battalions of the Party army, before boarding the ship, were stationed at the Clarini Barracks. This barracks is a red building, large in scale, originally built by the French Baben Wangbao and used as a warehouse. The Party army paraded in formation, led by the military band of the 133rd Regiment, playing the Neapolitan song "Marina Tripoli" made during the 1912 war between Italy and the Libyan region of Africa. The soldiers of the Party army rose and danced when they heard the horn, inserting flowers on their guns and small pieces of paper on their helmets. The Ganges also carried 200 tons of equipment and many mules and horses, and is expected to arrive in Massawa next Sunday. (Havas Dispatch, 18th)</p>

<p>Since the Fascist Party's Supreme Council decided to send three battalions of troops to Northeast Africa, it is believed here that there will be large-scale military operations in the future. The reason why Mussolini sent volunteers to Africa is to make his regular army ready for contingencies in Central Europe. Martin believes that the steps taken by Italy so far have exceeded the scope of self-defense, and the purpose may not only be to obtain reparations, but may have more ambitious goals.

<p>[Rome] After holding meetings for several days, the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party issued a communique, stating that the government has taken all necessary measures to maintain and increase the army's strength. The intention of this communique is to point out that Italy's military manufacturing has already increased its quantity, prepared for any eventuality. It is generally believed that the current situation in Europe has not yet been fully clarified. After a large number of military supplies are transported to East Africa, the national defense of Europe will be a concern. Now, after this statement, this concern can be dispelled. It is generally estimated that Italy can immediately dispatch 70,000 troops to Africa, and 30,000 more can be trained later. (Havas Dispatch, 17th)</p>

<p>[Rome] The Fascist Grand Council has resolved that Italian men between the ages of six and fifty-five should undergo military training. It is said that this is a major step taken by Mussolini to unite and instill Fascist ideology into the people. A large proportion of Italians will be affected, as well as any civilians with some military value. According to the laws, Italian men of a certain age are already required to receive military training, but this new resolution is as thorough as the Soviet Union's compulsory study of communism.

<p>[Paris] It is quite believable that Germany is currently making worrying preparations in the Tyrol province on the Austrian border. The Vienna correspondent of the Daily Telegraph reports that three divisions of troops from Bavaria, Germany, have begun to mobilize. Italy has also mobilized two armies on the Italian-Austrian border, paying particular attention to the Brenner Pass. It is said that Mussolini issued this sudden mobilization order because he feared that the National Socialist Party would take the opportunity to start an uprising in Austria while Italian troops were being sent to North Africa. (18th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>[Rome] The Vienna correspondent of the Daily Telegraph has sent news stating that Italy has mobilized two armies on the Italian-Austrian border, especially near the Brenner Pass. This has been reported in another telegram. Semi-official sources here deny this news, but tacitly acknowledge that necessary measures have been taken to strengthen border defenses. Although Rome has not heard of any alarms outside the border, border defense cannot be neglected because Italian troops have begun to deploy to Africa. As for the mobilization measures taken due to the Italian-Ethiopian conflict, soldiers of the 1911 class are being successively called up by name. In addition, mobilization work technically involves soldiers of other classes, and preparations are being made for their call-up. However, at present, except for soldiers of the 1911 class, volunteers, and technicians, no other call-ups have been implemented. (18th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>[Moscow] Reporting on the battles of the anti-Japanese volunteer army in Manchuria, Pravda says, "Special attention must be paid to these wars. As a rule, the wave of rebellion inevitably decreases every winter because the weather in Manchuria is too cold, and the rebels lack food and clothing and cannot advance quickly. However, 1934 was the most difficult year for the working masses in Manchuria. Millions of hungry and exhausted farmers flowed from the countryside to the cities, and thousands of them joined the rebel ranks. They disregarded the severe cold and advanced towards Shenyang, Jinzhou, and Jilin. This was completely unexpected by the Japanese military authorities. A month ago, Japanese newspapers claimed that the rebels in Manchuria had been completely eliminated." Therefore, Pravda concludes, "This report is premature."

<p>China United News Agency Tokyo Dispatch: The Japanese government organized a committee on February 13th to investigate the abolition of extraterritoriality in puppet Manchukuo. The chairman is Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Shigemitsu. It is heard that the outline of the withdrawal plan is as follows: (1) Japan will abolish civil and criminal jurisdiction after puppet Manchukuo implements major laws and modern court and prison systems. (2) The abolition of jurisdiction will exclude the Kwantung Leased Territory and the South Manchuria Railway Zone. (3) However, before puppet Manchukuo fully possesses a judicial system, Japanese defendants must be tried by Japanese judges. (4) After Japan abolishes jurisdiction, it must recognize that Japanese people have the right to do business and reside throughout puppet Manchukuo, and enjoy the right to own real estate and all related rights. (5) When Japan completely abolishes extraterritoriality, it will recognize puppet Manchukuo's administrative rights in the South Manchuria Railway Zone, but for a certain period, puppet Manchukuo must compensate Japanese residents in the affiliated territories for their losses.</p>

<p>Cristobal: Twenty-three large airships commonly used by the US Navy today resumed a practice flight of 4,000 miles. This flight passed over the Caribbean Sea and was commanded by Rear Admiral Johnson on the flagship Wright. One aircraft's float leaked water, and the Wright picked it up at the Zamama Naval Base in Santo Domingo. This was the only unfortunate incident of the trip. General Johnson's aircraft fly thousands of miles each year. In addition to today's flight, similar aircraft recently flew successfully from San Diego, California, to Alaska and Honolulu.

<p>Lord Elton Writes to Warn</p>
<p>[London] Lord Elton recently published an article in The Times, saying, "Japan is now seeking to tear up the Nine-Power Treaty and the collective peace system in the Far East. There is no doubt that Japan wants to create a 'fait accompli' in China, the same as it created in Manchuria. What methods should be used to deal with this situation today is not what I want to discuss. However, it will definitely not be through war. It is only because of this that Japan is able to act so rampantly and recklessly. In short, since the Nine-Power Treaty has been destroyed by Japan without the consent of the signatory countries, will the remaining signatory countries adopt a laissez-faire policy or will they unite to take strong action? There is a big difference between the two. As for China, it is unwilling to become a colony of Japan. China hopes to gain independence and not be dominated by any foreign power. Moreover, the financial assistance provided by Britain, the United States, Russia, France, and Italy to China is more effective than that of Japan. If these five countries can maintain their position, they can not only keep China on the track created by the Washington Treaty, but also protect the legitimate interests of all countries in China," and so on.

<p>[Paris] On the anniversary of the death of former King Albert I of Belgium, Prime Minister Flandin delivered a speech in the evening, broadcasted via wireless radio, briefly stating that the former king was the noblest person in the world. He was loved by his subjects throughout his life and maintained his loyalty, holding the feelings of all peoples without the slightest relaxation. Now the former king has passed away. Wars and funerals, these two things, after the passage of time, are easily forgotten by the world. Later generations who celebrate the will for peace may forget the terrible nightmares of the past and the lessons of their tragedies. However, the will for peace is not achieved overnight, but is gained through the hard work of mankind. Now that mankind is caught in deep water and fire, concentrating efforts to save poverty and unemployment is a matter of urgency. The feelings of society and the feelings of the nation are inseparable. King Albert of Belgium governed with virtue and loved his people like his own children. He can be said to have both social and national feelings. Not only that, King Albert always sought the balanced development of body and mind. Although he unfortunately lost his life because of this, he is enough to be a model for us forever. Since the French and Belgian peoples hold the same ideas, commemorating the merits of the former king, we should always be loyal to him. (17th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Baroness Falls in Love</p>
<p>Inducing Noble Women to Be Used</p>
<p>Military Secrets Leaked, Social Flower Beheaded</p>
<p>[Berlin] Baroness Berg and Mrs. Nazzena were sentenced to death after being accused of selling Germany's entire mobilization plan to a certain foreign country. If German leader Hitler does not grant leniency, they will be executed today. After the execution, the charges will be announced. It is heard that the means used for espionage are like materials from novels. First, Baroness Berg became acquainted with a Polish officer named Sosnowski, who was addicted to gambling, skilled at riding, and beautiful and flattering. Before long, the baroness fell in love and could not extricate herself, and she willingly ran around to seek out military secrets. Her plan was very poisonous. The baroness made many female friends in social circles, many of whom were daughters of senior military officers and officials of the Army Department. She invited these women every day to indulge in drinking and introduced them to young men. Those with weak wills engaged in illicit behavior, and the baroness secretly took their photos and showed them to them. For the sake of their faces, these women had no choice but to obey her. As for Mrs. Nazzena, she was also an accomplice of Sosnowski. (17th Reuters Telegram)</p>

German leader Hitler did not want to grant leniency, so they were beheaded this morning in front of the prison here. Two others, one being Mrs. Gena and the other being the Polish officer, were accomplices and were sentenced to life imprisonment with hard labor. (18th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>Permitting Germany's Military Equality on One Hand,</p>
<p>While Tacitly Approving its Freedom in Eastern Europe</p>
<p>The So-Called Air Pact Creates War Opportunities</p>
<p>[Moscow] Izvestia commented on Germany's reply to the Anglo-French proposal, saying, "Germany's reply is even worse than the expectations of the most pessimistic observers of the current situation." The newspaper quoted the Anglo-French press on the German reply, saying, "Germany's attitude and the comments of the English newspapers on its reply are clearly in collusion, and the latter can indeed reflect the opinions of the British government authorities. The British authorities are willing to allow Germany military equality (meaning arming it) while allowing it freedom of action in Eastern Europe. In other words, the British authorities are willing to encourage Hitler's aggressive ambitions for German fascism, which he clearly stipulated in his book 'Mein Kampf.' This attitude of the UK is a powerful blow to France, as we all know that 'peace is indivisible.'"</p>
<p>"If Germany is allowed freedom of action in Eastern Europe today, Germany will allow itself freedom of action in Western Europe tomorrow. In this way, the Little Entente countries will have no security. This means that France's position on the European continent will be greatly weakened. At the same time, if Germany attacks Czechoslovakia and France will aid Czechoslovakia because of the alliance treaty, then according to the original intention of the Air Pact, which deviated from the London Agreement, Britain will attack France. Therefore, the British authorities' attack on the Eastern European Pact is also an attack on France. The German reply has another purpose, which is to eliminate France's credibility with its allies and friends. When Berlin drafted the reply, it claimed that the gist of its reply was in line with British hopes and that it was willing to cooperate with Britain to get France out of its current position and weaken it. If the spirit of the London proposal is as expected in the German reply, then its impact on peace will be extremely serious and great. The air pact between Germany, France, and England cannot prevent war; on the contrary, it creates war crises and intensifies them several times. This is because it grants freedom of action to German imperialists. The British authorities are consolidating the position of the enemies of peace under the guise of maintaining peace. Therefore, the British authorities should bear full responsibility for maintaining European peace," (TASS dispatch, 17th).</p>
<p>[London] Since the publication of Germany's reply to the Anglo-French suggestions, British newspapers seemed to hope that discussions between the UK and Germany could be held. However, they also believed that the situation created by the German reply was quite chaotic. If the UK was too eager, it would be rash. The Daily Telegraph reported, "If Foreign Secretary Simon goes to Berlin, Germany's prestige will inevitably increase. But at the present stage, for the sake of practical results, it seems better for Germany to send someone to Britain." The Daily Mail reported, "If talks can be held between the UK and Germany, they would be as appropriate a measure as talks between the UK and France. However, at the current stage, whether UK-German talks would be beneficial is questionable. If we consider it carefully, we think it is better to let things take their natural course for the time being and consider it again after Berlin has replied anew." The Morning Post said, "Under the current circumstances, it would be a waste of time for Foreign Secretary Simon to go to Berlin or for German Foreign Minister Neurath to come here." The newspaper also criticized the Soviet Union in a pessimistic tone, saying that the country was only seeking its own interests, hindering France's freedom of action, and even sowing discord among Western European countries, which was inappropriate. The newspaper also launched a fierce attack on Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov (Havas dispatch, 18th).</p>

<h3 id="e100">The 80th Division Launches a Campaign to Eradicate Opium in Zhao'an <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>[Xiamen] The 80th Division's opium eradication campaign in Zhao'an is based on Chairman Chen Yi's telegram and a direct telegram from Chairman Chiang, who received reliable reports that there are still many opium seedlings in remote areas of Zhao'an, Yunxiao, and other counties in southern Fujian that have not been eradicated. He ordered the local administrative and military officers to jointly and strictly eradicate them, not allowing a single flower or seedling to exist. If there is any gathering to resist eradication, they should be resolutely suppressed. Division Commander Chen Qi forwarded Chairman Chiang's telegram and immediately sent troops to Zhao'an. The villagers of Meizhou took the initiative to resist the eradication, and the troops retaliated, killing and wounding eight or nine opium farmers, and two soldiers were also injured. In order to thoroughly eradicate opium, Chen Qi successively sent the entire 239th Brigade and the 476th Regiment of the 2nd and 3rd Brigade, a total of three regiments, to Zhao'an. Brigade Commander Qi Guohuan personally went to command. The people of Anke are known to be fierce, and they have been growing opium for years, which cannot be prohibited. They have ignored the ban.

<h3 id="e104">Disaster Victims in Eastern and Southern Hubei Die One After Another <a href="#e104" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c104" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">104</a></h3>
<p>Many Starved Disaster Victims in Huangmei Resemble a Ghost Land</p>
<p>Relief Association's Inspection and Distribution Office Asks for More Funds for Relief</p>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The drought in Hubei Province last year was extremely severe. The counties in eastern and southern Hubei had no harvest, and the number of disaster victims who could not survive without relief reached four to five million. Although the government authorities and charitable organizations made efforts to provide relief, the funds were too few and the people were too many, making it difficult to achieve universal coverage. In addition to Yangxin County, where 1,800 people died of starvation, deaths also occurred daily in Huangmei, Huang'an, Macheng, Lishan, Wuchang, Hanyang, Tongshan, Tongcheng, Chongyang, Puji, Xianning, Daye, Huanggang, Echeng, Qichun, Guangji, Luotian, Yingshan, Huangpi, Xiaogan, and other counties. Now that the spring famine is coming to an end, everything has been exhausted, and even more people are dying. The situation in the disaster areas is difficult to describe in full detail based only on telegram reports. The reporter recently went to eastern Hubei for business and passed through Huangmei, the county most severely affected by the disaster. The reporter entered the countryside to investigate and saw that the disaster victims were eating things like white clay, tree bark, and grass roots. They did not know the taste of salt and rice. Their clothes were full of patches, and they slept on grass. The walls of their homes were full of holes, not sheltering them from the wind and rain. Some even lived in cattle pens, pig sheds, or broken boats. Livestock had long been slaughtered, and chickens were rarely seen, resembling a ghost land. The reporter also saw a woman named Shi carrying her young son to the market, weeping uncontrollably. Old and weak disaster victims were dying every day, five or six people to more than ten people, and they were hastily buried and left on the roads. The tragic situation made it unbearable to hear or see. If Huangmei is like this, other places can also be inferred.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Drought Relief Association for Various Provinces has established an inspection and distribution office in Hubei. The 150,000 yuan allocated was only distributed to eight counties and districts, including Yangxin, which was not enough. Fourteen counties, including Tongshan, are still waiting. The office urgently telegraphed the Shanghai Association yesterday, requesting additional funds for relief. The telegram stated that the 150,000 yuan allocated to Hubei Province had been fully distributed to eight counties and districts, including Yangxin, Huangmei, Huang'an, Macheng, Lishan, Wuchang, Hanyang, and the Dapan Special District, in accordance with the principle of "saving the dying, not the poor" and providing relief to the elderly, weak, disabled, and others over 50 years old and under 15 years old who could not survive without relief. Even with the distribution to eight counties, it was still not enough. The disaster in Hubei Province is severe, and the disaster area is vast. It is impossible to help only the disaster victims in eight counties. According to recent investigations, the disaster situation in Tongshan, Tongcheng, Chongyang, Puji, Xianning, and Dazhi in southern Hubei, as well as Huanggang, Echeng, Qichun, Guangji, Luotian, Yingshan, Huangpi, and Xiaogan in eastern Hubei, is no less severe than that in Yangxin and Huangma. After suffering from banditry, these counties suffered a drought, and 80-90% of the people were displaced and had no smoke rising from their chimneys. In this freezing weather, there is no bark to peel from the trees and no grass to dig from the ground. The cries of hunger and cold can be heard everywhere, and the white bones on the roadside are all innocent, starving ghosts. It is not just a matter of abandoning wives and selling children and eating soil. Therefore, we have no choice but to ask the association to approve the allocation of more funds to help them survive and expand relief (17th).</p>
<h3 id="e105">Taiwan's Trade Increases Sharply <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>Nearly 20 Million More Than the Same Period Last Year</p>
<p>Japanese Tea Production Also Increases Dramatically</p>
<p>Xiamen Correspondence: According to a survey by the Financial Bureau of the Taiwan Governor-General's Office, the total amount of Taiwan's foreign trade in January of this year was 58,923,028 yuan, an increase of 19,450,785 yuan compared to the 39,472,243 yuan in January of last year. Among them, foreign trade accounted for 5,659,558 yuan, an increase of 6,9063 yuan compared to January of last year. In terms of imports and exports, exports were 2,424,359 yuan, an increase of 986,870 yuan compared to the same period last year, and imports were 3,235,219 yuan, a decrease of 917,807 yuan compared to the same period last year. The increase in exports in January was due to the rise in silver prices and the export of various intermediary trade products, while imports decreased sharply. The total amount of domestic trade (that is, Taiwan's trade with Japan) in January was 53,263,470 yuan, an increase of 19,381,712 yuan compared to the 33,882,748 yuan in January of last year. This was mainly due to the increase in the export (i.e., export to Japan) of major products such as rice and sugar, as well as the increase in the import of cotton fabrics, fertilizers, and food from the mainland (Japan).</p>
<p>In recent years, the production of black tea in Shizuoka and Taiwan has increased dramatically. In 1933, Shizuoka's black tea production was only 128,662 catties, while Taiwan's was only 1,372,797 catties. In 1934, Shizuoka's production jumped to 2,193,907 catties, an increase of 17 times. Taiwan also increased to 5,494,220 catties, an increase of 5 times. Although the price in 1933 was higher than in 1934, the rapid and significant increase in quantity shows the dramatic expansion of Japanese tea (February 13th).</p>

<p>Zhang Jingjiang Inspects the Jingwu and Wusun Projects</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Jiangnan Railway Company is building the Jingzhao Railway, which starts from the capital in the north and connects to Fujian and Guangdong in the south, running north-south for more than a thousand miles. The section from Wuhu to Sunjiabu in Jiangsu and Anhui has already been opened to traffic. After the contract for cargo transport was signed with the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company to handle combined shipping between Wuhu and Shanghai, it was implemented the day before yesterday. Passengers are also participating in the four-way combined transport with the Jingwu Highway and the Jinghu Railway Bureau. It is extremely convenient for travelers from Xuancheng and Sunjiabu to travel to Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. The progress of the Jingwu section of the project has also been very rapid. The Dangtu River Bridge, a major project, was also completed the other day. Material vehicles have passed over the bridge and reached the north bank, laying tracks towards Beijing. After the sleepers are laid, vehicles between Beijing and Wuhu can simultaneously run on the bridge. The entire section of road construction is expected to be completed by March of this year. Zhang Jingjiang, the general manager of the company, along with Section Chief Qin of the Central Construction Committee and managers Pang Zan成 and others, departed from Beijing on the morning of the 12th in two cars to inspect the line. They arrived in Dangtu at 7:00 PM and carefully surveyed the bridge. They then transferred to a special car sent by the company to greet them in Wuhu, summoned officials from the general affairs, engineering, and transportation departments to consult on the project's progress. It was pointed out that this road is of great importance to the development of production in the southern provinces. In this time of national crisis, the central authorities have high expectations. Since most of the Jingwu project has been completed, they were urged to continue to work hard and it was decided to hold the opening ceremony for the Jingwu section on March 12, the anniversary of the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. After resting at the Wujiangkou Station in Wuhu, Zhang, accompanied by key officials from various districts, inspected the Wusun section in the original car. In Xuancheng, he met with Zhou Qunnan, the administrative commissioner of the Ninth District, and inquired about the order in southern Anhui and the lives of the people after the elimination of the remaining bandits. He returned to Wuhu at 4:00 PM and transferred to a car back to Beijing (13th).</p>
<h3 id="e107">Secret Copies of Palace Dramas <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>Completely Burned Due to Carelessness by the Drama School</p>
<p>The Palace's Stage Properties and Costumes Also Suffered</p>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: After the Qing Dynasty was overthrown, the palace's collection of theatrical costumes, stage properties, and scenery (such as the scenery in the "Dou Nu Gong Hun Yuan He" play) totaled about 300 boxes. Before the 10th year of the Republic of China, more than 100 boxes of the Qing Palace still existed and were exhibited from time to time. In addition to some of them being purchased by Mei Lanfang, Shang Xiaoyun, and others later, most of them were obtained by the Drama School. Jiao Juyin, the principal of the Drama School, was the nephew of Li Shizeng and had connections with the education circles of Beijing and Tianjin and various aspects of the Forbidden City. Jiao obtained about 50 or 60 of the more than 100 secret copies of palace dramas. These 50 or 60 secret copies of dramas included full plays and legends, some of which were Ming Dynasty manuscripts. These were extremely rare and could not be obtained even by Cheng Changgeng and Tan Xinpei in the past 100 years, so their value is evident.</p>
<p>The Drama School has been established by Jiao for several years and has achieved good results. It has produced many talents. In recent years, it has performed in various theaters in Beijing and gradually won the welcome of general opera fans. The only old-style opera troupe in Beijing, the Faliancheng Society, is already being overwhelmed. Last night (14th), due to a short circuit, a fire suddenly broke out in the school's warehouse. All the costumes, stage properties, and other items were not rescued at all, and the 50 or 60 secret copies of the Qing Palace's unique dramas were also destroyed in the fire. Although the school's property is said to have only suffered a loss of more than 10,000 yuan, the loss in terms of national heritage, documents, and academics is far more than tens of thousands of yuan! Some people say that the original copies of several legends such as "The Peony Pavilion" were also among those burned, which is truly a rare catastrophe for the literary and artistic circles.</p>
<p>In addition to running the Drama School, Jiao also took over the "Zhixingcheng" troupe, which was newly established the year before last but suffered heavy losses and was bought by Jiao last year. The entire troupe has about 60 or 70 students. After Jiao reorganized it, it was moved to the school outside Chongwen Gate, where everything is taught. The academic year is tentatively set for six years, and after graduation, they will join the Drama School and perform together in various places. It is a pity that the fire will undoubtedly affect its future (15th).</p>

<p>Red Cross Branch Sends Letter to County Magistrate Jin Requesting Guidance on Disaster Relief Methods</p>
<p>The Songjiang branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society, recognizing that since the end of the old lunar year, disaster victims from western Zhejiang have been flocking to Songjiang, begging for food along the way, and fearing that this would disrupt public order, and for the sake of providing relief for disaster victims' clothing, food, childbirth, illness, and death, immediately established a refugee shelter to engage in receiving them, as has been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. Now we record the resolutions of its yesterday's meeting and its official letter to the county government below. (1) Resolutions: The 9th meeting was held at 2:00 PM on February 17th, chaired by Sheng Jingsheng, with more than 20 attendees. (Item 1) A letter to the county government requesting attendance to provide guidance on public security measures was resolved as follows: After this society established the shelter, it completely accommodated the disaster victims in Songjiang. However, those begging on the streets are still occasionally seen. There are two reasons for this: 1. Philanthropists in Songjiang provide separate distributions, unable to act in unity. Refugees seek sustenance wherever they can, making it difficult to get them to go to the shelter. 2. Watchmen are needed for the refugees' boats. Disaster victims cannot be kept together in the shelter. There are still those passing through who beg along the streets. The members of this society find it difficult to resolve the above difficulties. The county magistrate is responsible for public security and should be invited to attend to provide guidance, so as to achieve perfection. (Item 2) A request for members to raise funds was resolved as follows: The chairman of the board, Zhou Xuewen, will prepare a donation booklet to be distributed to each member for fundraising at any time, and all institutions are requested to assist. The meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM. (2) Official Letter: Respected Sir, At the 9th meeting of this society on February 17th, the most difficult aspect of the Zhejiang disaster refugee shelter is that many refugees entering the shelter still go out to beg. The underlying reasons are approximately threefold: 1. Philanthropists in Songjiang provide separate distributions of money and rice, unable to act in unity. Disaster victims harbor the mentality that more is better, making it difficult to prohibit them from seeking elsewhere. 2. Watchmen are needed for the refugees' boats. Disaster victims cannot be kept together in the shelter. 3. It is impossible to investigate refugees passing through and begging along the way. The above three points were discussed and it was agreed that this society established the shelter with the original intention of completely accommodating disaster victims in Songjiang to avoid them begging along the way, which would disrupt public order. Now that there are the above-mentioned difficulties, the members of this society find it difficult to resolve them. The county magistrate, as the leader of the county, is responsible for public security and should be invited to attend to provide guidance, so as to achieve perfection, etc., as recorded in the minutes. This society has now decided to convene officials of this society at 2:00 PM on February 21st at the office of this society (inside the St. Joseph's Hospital) to discuss relief measures. At that time, we respectfully request your presence for guidance, to supplement our shortcomings. Sincerely, To: Jin, County Magistrate of Songjiang, From: Zhu Jiuwang, President of the Songjiang Branch of the Chinese Red Cross Society; Sheng Yuanyin, Speaker; Zhou Xuewen, Chairman of the Board.</p>
<p>Bandit Wu Shusheng Handed Over to Court</p>
<p>Wu Shusheng, a notorious bandit from Punan Shanyang, also known as Little Ah San, now renamed Wu Suisheng, was wanted by Zhejiang. On the night of December 27th last year, he ambushed the back door of Yang Xiangjin's house. When Yang went out to urinate, Wu suspected him of being a poor thief, so he stabbed Yang in the right leg with a knife. Yang shouted for help, and neighbors heard the sound and helped to tie Wu up. He was handed over to the Shanyang Security Detachment and then transferred to the brigade headquarters for interrogation. Yesterday, he was transferred to the court prosecutor's office for investigation and legal action.</p>

<p>Provincial Anti-Smoking Association Plans to Abolish Smoking Houses</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Anti-Smoking Committee recently received reports that most sales and smoking houses in various counties are selling private soil, which seriously affects anti-smoking efforts. A special committee member, Hu Jianyuan, was dispatched to inspect various counties, paying close attention to the advantages and disadvantages of establishing sales and smoking houses. It is planned to abolish the sales and smoking houses that have been established in various counties, leaving only a small number, and allowing the soil ointment stores to directly sell cooked ointment, providing it to smokers for smoking at home. The above measures have already been implemented in Wujin and Rugao counties, and it is planned to gradually implement them throughout the province.</p>

<p>Levying Boat Taxes to Dredge River Ports</p>
<p>The county government held a committee meeting on the 16th to discuss the dredging of the Huangchugang South Canal. Regarding the funding issue, in addition to the provincial assistance of 65,000 yuan, there is still a shortfall of 95,000 yuan. It was decided to request approval from the provincial authorities to retain all the dredging fees collected in the county, and to use the road construction mu tax, the original water conservancy fee collection, and the 50,000 yuan face value of Jiangsu construction bonds as collateral to borrow from a consortium. Starting from July of this year, collection points for dredging fees will be set up at Huangtiangang and Sihe Gate, with a term of three years.

<p>Fire in Xiaji River Burns One Child to Death</p>
<p>In the home of farmer Ge Damo in Xiaji River, Fifth District of this county, at around 9:00 PM last night (15th), his wife was careless while cooking dinner, igniting the accumulated firewood, which suddenly caused a fire. Flames immediately burst through the roof, and the fire illuminated the sky. The alarm bell was immediately rung, and villagers rushed to put out the fire, but the fire was too fierce and could not be extinguished. The fire also spread to the homes of neighbors Zhu Dexi, Xia Er, and Xia Baocai. The fire was finally extinguished at around 1:00 AM, with more than 30 rooms in total from the four families, as well as clothing and utensils, all reduced to ashes, with losses totaling over a thousand yuan. Zhu's four-year-old daughter was sleeping in bed and could not be rescued, resulting in her tragic death in the fire.</p>

<h3 id="e120">Ministry of Finance Encourages Foreign Bank Inflow <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>Future Re-exports to be Exempt from Taxes</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Director-General of Customs was Instructed to Comply</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, upon receiving petitions from the All-China Federation of Commerce and other organizations, regarding promoting foreign bank inflows to regulate the market for the sake of invigorating finance and developing industry and commerce, has now stipulated three measures. Yesterday, a special instruction was issued to the Director-General of Customs, scheduled to be implemented on the 19th (today). The original text of the instruction and the reply to the All-China Federation of Commerce and other organizations are recorded below:</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Instruction to the Director-General of Customs</p>
<p>Instruction No. 12 (Shanghai Money): Order to the Director-General of Customs: In the case of the joint petition from the All-China Federation of Commerce, the Shanghai Banking Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Shanghai Money Industry Association, requesting the encouragement of foreign bank inflows to regulate the market, it is noted that these associations, recognizing that the export of silver has been increasing daily, causing hardship for domestic industry and commerce, petitioned and were granted a decree by the Ministry to levy a silver export equalization tax. Since then, exports have gradually decreased, people's confidence has been somewhat restored, and the national economy and people's livelihoods have benefited. However, the key to finance is circulation. The purpose of the equalization tax is to restrict the export of silver, but it is also sufficient to restrict the inflow of foreign bank funds. Under current market conditions, there is a possibility of gradually returning foreign silver, but due to the silver tax, they are hesitant. We request that you, in the spirit of maintaining industrial and commercial activity and finance, clearly stipulate measures to encourage the import of foreign silver, ordering the Director-General of Customs to allow registration with customs for all foreign silver imported from abroad. In the future, when re-exported, it will be exempt from all principal and surtaxes. In this way, foreign silver can be expected to be imported at any time to meet domestic needs. Moreover, the import of silver is not included in the domestic silver reserves, and granting tax exemption upon re-export is not inconsistent with the original purpose of the Ministry's taxation. Therefore, we respectfully request your approval for implementation. The Foreign Exchange Market Stabilization Committee has also submitted a similar request to the Ministry. Upon investigation, the addition of a silver export tax and the levying of an equalization tax were originally intended to cope with the crisis and stabilize finance. Since implementation, silver exports have decreased, and the market has been stabilized, benefiting the national economy and people's livelihoods. However, for the sake of invigorating finance and developing industry and commerce, the encouragement of foreign bank inflows requested by the associations is in line with the Ministry's intention and is not inconsistent with the purpose of adding a silver export tax and levying an equalization tax. It should be approved. The following measures are now stipulated: (1) For raw silver or national currency imported from abroad, the amount and date of import shall be registered with the importing customs, which will issue a certificate. In the future, if re-export is necessary, the original importer may present the original certificate to the Ministry to exchange for a tax-exempt passport for the original amount of raw silver or national currency. (2) Those holding the aforementioned tax-exempt passport for export, in addition to paying a 2.25% tax, will be exempt from the silver export tax and equalization tax added on October 15, 1934. (3) The minimum amount of raw silver imported each time shall not be less than 500,000 ounces. If it is national currency, it shall be converted and calculated accordingly. In addition to the instruction, this order is to inform the Director-General of Customs to comply, to be announced and implemented on February 19th, and to report to the Ministry for record after issuing the certificate. This order.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Reply to the All-China Federation of Commerce and Others</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Reply to the All-China Federation of Commerce, the Shanghai Banking Association, the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, and the Shanghai Money Industry Association, regarding the petition to encourage foreign silver imports to regulate the market. According to the joint petition from the associations, requesting a clear stipulation of measures to encourage the import of foreign silver, ordering the Director-General of Customs to allow registration with customs for foreign silver imported from abroad, and exempting principal and surtaxes upon re-export in the future, to regulate the market, and the Foreign Exchange Market Stabilization Committee also submitted a similar request. All have been read. Upon investigation, the addition of a silver export tax and the levying of an equalization tax were originally intended to cope with the crisis and stabilize finance. Since implementation, silver exports have decreased, and the market has been stabilized, benefiting the national economy and people's livelihoods. However, for the sake of invigorating finance and developing industry and commerce, the encouragement of foreign bank inflows requested by the associations is in line with the Ministry's intention and is not inconsistent with the purpose of adding a silver export tax and levying an equalization tax. It should be approved. The following measures are now stipulated: (1) For raw silver or national currency imported from abroad, the amount and date of import shall be registered with the importing customs, which will issue a certificate.

<h3 id="e122">The Relationship Between the New Life Movement and Health <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>— Li Tingan</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang promotes the New Life Movement with the aim of revitalizing the nation, with the entire populace as its driving force, and with cleanliness as its primary focus. Indeed, national rejuvenation requires the participation of the entire populace, and the main contribution the entire populace can make to the country is their sound physical health. The cultivation of sound physical health should begin with the initial steps, starting with attention to cleanliness. Therefore, the consistent principle of the New Life Movement promoted by Chairman Chiang is to emphasize fundamentals and be careful at the beginning, and a major component of this chain of emphasizing fundamentals and being careful at the beginning is the cultivation of national health.</p>
<p>There are many ways to achieve health, and the technical methods are even more complex. For example, issues of nutrition, disease prevention, physical examinations, early diagnosis, and physical training are all closely related to the physical and mental health of individuals. Research into these methods are all technical issues. However, if we want to train the entire populace to move towards the realm of national health in an orderly manner, we must not disregard the order of priorities, leading to confusion and counterproductive haste. Therefore, we must distinguish between the important and the less important, and start the training from the most basic points that are most relevant to the daily life of the populace. That is, cleanliness. Since the main component of the New Life Movement is national health, this link of national health in the chain of the New Life Movement is different from ordinary health issues and must be connected by the fundamental principles that run through the entire movement. In other words, any aspect of the New Life Movement must start small and proceed gradually. Training in health should not involve empty talk of lofty ideals, but rather focus on laying solid foundations. It is fitting that the ignorant do not understand its essence and instead ridicule it as superficial. Little do they know that what is ridiculed as superficial is precisely the greatness of the spirit of the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Cleanliness is indeed of great importance to life. For example, frequent bathing can keep the body's blood flowing smoothly. After our food is digested by the stomach and intestines, the absorbable nutrients are transported to various tissues of the body via the lymphatic vessels and blood. After oxidation, they supply the needs of life, producing various toxic waste products in the process of oxidation. The main ones are carbonic acid, urea, uric acid, etc. Carbon dioxide is expelled from the body by the lungs, while urea and uric acid are excreted with water by the urinary system or through the sweat glands of the skin. Over time, although the water can evaporate, sweat stains (such as urea and various bases) often accumulate at the openings of the glands. If not diligently washed away, they can easily block the openings, losing the function of draining waste and regulating body temperature, thus easily leading to illness. If one is diligent in bathing, this harm can be eliminated. Therefore, the New Life Covenant says: "Bathe often." Also, washing hands before meals and after defecation may seem like a minor matter, but the hands are often in contact with external objects and can easily carry various germs. If hands are not washed before eating, there is a possibility of bringing germs into the mouth. Our feces often contain germs as well. If hands are washed after defecation, the germs can be prevented from re-entering the mouth. Therefore, the New Life Covenant says: "Wash hands often." Furthermore, the cleanliness of teeth is most important. If food accumulates and rots in the gaps between the teeth, it will not only cause yellow teeth and bad breath, but also damage the teeth and lead to dental diseases. If one suffers from dental diseases or tooth roots rot and breed bacteria, the bacteria can enter the stomach and cause stomach diseases, which is greatly harmful. Therefore, the New Life Covenant says: "Rinse mouth after meals, brush teeth every morning." Respiratory diseases such as colds and tuberculosis are spread by droplets expelled from the mouth and nose, such as fine mist, which can infect others when inhaled. If one turns away and covers the mouth and nose with a handkerchief when sneezing or coughing, the expelled droplets will not fly into the air. Therefore, the New Life Covenant says: "Always carry a handkerchief." These few examples show that although these are all very small matters, they are all of great importance to the health of individuals and the public. It also shows that these seemingly minor habits have not yet been universally developed among our Chinese people and still need to be promoted. The following are the forty-four articles related to health out of the 119 articles of the New Life Covenant, to show the close relationship between the New Life Movement and health.</p>
<p>(1) Nine articles on food:</p>
<p>Do not smoke; do not drink excessively; do not eat snacks; drink several glasses of boiled water early in the morning; do not eat unclean food; do not drink unboiled water; rinse mouth after meals, brush teeth every morning; do not engage in strenuous exercise before or after meals; strive for cleanliness in the kitchen and utensils.</p>
<p>(2) Two articles on clothing:</p>
<p>Clothes should be neat, simple, and clean; always carry a handkerchief.</p>
<p>(3) Twenty-three articles on living:</p>
<p>Houses should be clean and tidy, walls should not be scribbled on, furniture should be simple, windows should be opened often, go to bed and wake up early, rinse mouth, wash hair, and wash hands often, breathe fresh air, engage in appropriate exercise every day, wash fingernails often, bathe often, bedding should be sunned and washed often, pay attention to the cleanliness of children, sweep the house often, dredge ditches often, tables and chairs should be clean, toilets should be clean, mosquitoes should be exterminated, flies should be exterminated, rats should be caught and killed, do not spit everywhere, do not urinate and defecate everywhere, throw garbage in the trash can, every household should sweep the streets in front of their doors every day.</p>
<p>(4) One article on movement:</p>
<p>Do not urinate everywhere.</p>
<p>(5) Three articles on entertainment:</p>
<p>Do not patronize prostitutes, do not dance with dance hostesses, do not read obscene books or look at obscene pictures, choose a proper form of entertainment.</p>
<h3 id="e123">Review and Outlook of the New Life Movement <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>— Wen Chaoji</p>
<p>(1) Dr. Sun Yat-sen advocated for the National Revolution, seeking to rescue the Chinese nation from a feudal society characterized by political corruption, dark education, ineffective laws, moral collapse, and economic bankruptcy, and to achieve a society with clear politics, effective education, effective laws, sound morals, economic equality, and a government of the people, by the people, and for the people.</p>
<p>Dr. Sun Yat-sen dedicated his life to this cause, thereby inspiring the prevailing trend and creating a situation in which, with an indomitable spirit that could not be corrupted by wealth, swayed by poverty, or subdued by force, he led the righteous people of the entire Chinese nation, solidified into an irresistible force, and finally overthrew the evil feudal system of the Qing Dynasty.</p>
<p>Leader Chiang Kai-shek, adhering to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's principles for more than thirty years, absolutely obeyed orders and carried out the revolution when Dr. Sun Yat-sen was alive, and after Dr. Sun Yat-sen's death, he continued his aspirations and vigorously practiced his principles, never slacking for a single day.</p>
<p>Leader Chiang Kai-shek, through the arduous struggles of the revolutionary movement, gained countless practical experiences and realized that to implement the entire legacy as soon as possible, it was necessary to first have a broad and universal national movement that everyone could participate in, everyone could do, and everyone could benefit from.</p>
<p>This broad and universal movement is the New Life Movement that the Leader advocated last year amidst the victorious suppression of bandits in Jiangxi.</p>
<p>(2) The New Life Movement has been going on for a year now. Looking back on the work of the New Life Movement over the past year, we feel infinite joy and excitement. Since the Leader advocated the New Life Movement in Jiangxi, upholding the forty virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, he hoped that all citizens would base themselves on these essentials and express their orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, and plainness in their actual lives of clothing, food, housing, and transportation. Speed and thoroughness should be shown in order to change the prevailing atmosphere, rejuvenate the nation, and save it from peril. For a year, the whole country has heard the news and followed suit, setting an example. Starting in Nanchang, the results have been the best in the country. The orderliness of the city, the orderliness of the order, and the cleanliness of the citizens all make people look up to them with respect. As for the leaders of the Party, government, military, police, academic, industrial, agricultural, and commercial circles, they are all able to cooperate sincerely to promote the New Life Movement, and they have also received personal guidance from the Leader. All the people of Nanchang are inspired by the Leader's great spirit, and they all sincerely and willingly follow the Leader's guidance. Therefore, it is no accident that Nanchang has achieved such excellent results. This is one aspect.</p>
<p>Furthermore, major cities such as Hankou, Peiping, Luoyang, and the capital have also been able to implement the New Life Movement in accordance with the Leader's "New Life Movement Outline" and "New Life Guidelines." New Life Guidance Teams were organized to practice the New Life Movement themselves on the one hand, and to actively persuade citizens to practice the New Life Movement on the other hand, and to stipulate various matters for compliance with public order and public health. A serious effort was made to promote and implement the general inspection of orderliness and cleanliness, with considerable results. As for the constitutional police jointly formulating measures to implement the New Life Movement and cooperating to diligently guide implementation, this is especially characteristic.</p>
<p>Finally, let's talk about Shanghai. The New Life Movement in Shanghai has been very active. Mayor Wu and leaders from all walks of life, based on the essence of the Leader's New Life Movement, have made earnest efforts to promote it. Since I took over the Public Security Bureau, I have been fortunate to participate in the work of the New Life Movement, following Mayor Wu and leaders from all walks of life. I have never dared to abandon my responsibility in my Bureau and in the places where my personal responsibilities lie. Therefore, at the beginning of my tenure, I followed the provisions of the New Life Movement, starting with the practical implementation in my Bureau. All aspects of daily office work and the private lives of all staff members are required to conform to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and to express orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, plainness, speed, and thoroughness. We are now actively urging and promoting it. Other works, such as holding a city-wide general cleanliness inspection jointly with the Health Bureau and rectifying the city's appearance, have also been actively and continuously promoted. We hope that leaders from all walks of life and all citizens will rigorously supervise us so that the New Life Movement can make substantial progress, which would be a great blessing.</p>
<p>Looking back on the work of the New Life Movement over the past year, the results have been very good. Since the Leader advocated it, leaders and organizations from all walks of life across the country have been inspired and have risen up. A broad atmosphere has been established, and all models are gradually in place. The foundation for national rejuvenation lies here.</p>
<p>(3) Looking forward to the future of the New Life Movement, we feel that there is an infinitely good prospect. From now on, I plan to implement the "New Life Movement Outline" and "New Life Guidelines" stipulated by the Leader, as well as the various matters stipulated by the New Life Movement General Association and the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, in conjunction with all relevant parties. The handling of various matters is described as follows:</p>
<p>First, I plan to urge all staff and police officers of the Bureau to earnestly implement the provisions of the New Life Movement in their public and private lives. For example, clothing, food, housing, and transportation must conform to the provisions of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and must express orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, plainness, speed, and thoroughness at all times. I also plan to conduct inspections, assessments, and exhortations at any time to ensure that all police officers meet the standards of the New Life Movement and develop the spirit of automatically and consistently practicing the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Second, I plan to instruct the Public Security Sub-bureaus and Stations to urge their subordinate police officers to lead by example in guiding citizens to practice the New Life Movement, stipulating a period for inspecting whether the residents under the jurisdiction of each Sub-bureau and Station are practicing the New Life Movement. Households that can earnestly implement the New Life Movement will be given honorary awards, and those who do not implement the New Life Movement or do not implement it effectively will be given advice with a kind and enthusiastic attitude to ensure that they can implement the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>Third, I plan to schedule a time to hold a city-wide general cleanliness inspection in conjunction with relevant agencies or personnel to ensure that the city is always kept clean, thereby increasing the health of citizens, improving the appearance of the city, enhancing its appearance, and enhancing the international status of our country.</p>
<p>I am determined to gradually implement the above three points this year.</p>
<p>(4) Finally, I sincerely hope that people from all walks of life will, from now on, follow the various matters indicated by the Leader's New Life Movement, practice them personally, practice propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame as individuals, achieve orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, plainness, speed, and thoroughness in daily life, and then practice propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame as groups, and collectively achieve orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, plainness, speed, and thoroughness. Furthermore, all the people of the country should consistently practice propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and all the people of the country should consistently achieve orderliness, cleanliness, simplicity, plainness, speed, and thoroughness. Only in this way can our nation be revived, and all the humiliations of our country can be completely washed away. This proves that the New Life Movement is a great work to complete our national rejuvenation movement. I urge my compatriots to rise up together and practice the New Life Movement.</p>

Recently, he specially requested the National Government to award Director Yang the First Class Medal of the Army, Navy, and Air Force to show his encouragement. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement the year before last, the Command has been vigorously implementing it. All aspects of the New Life Movement that the military should implement have been fully implemented. The subordinate national forces submit a weekly report on the implementation and review of the New Life Movement for verification and guidance. Over the past year, the Command has achieved great results in management, education, and training.

<h3 id="e127">The Envoy to Turkey, He Yaozu, Will Go Abroad to Assume Office on Schedule <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Sent Counselor Wang Pengsheng to Turkey to Prepare in Advance</p>
<p>The Sino-Turkish Commercial Treaty Will Await His Arrival to Solicit Opinions</p>
<p>The newly appointed Envoy to Turkey, He Yaozu, arrived in Shanghai on the special night express train at one quarter past five yesterday morning. He is staying at the Yipinxiang Hotel on Tibet Road. He came to visit Minister of Finance Kong due to his illness and to discuss the embassy's expenses. He returned to Beijing that evening and is scheduled to go abroad to take office on the thirteenth of next month. A reporter from the New Voice News Agency paid a special visit yesterday. According to the interview, the details are as follows:</p>
<p>Going to Take Office on Schedule</p>
<p>Since receiving the government's appointment, I have been actively preparing everything. Originally, I planned to go to take office today, but due to the embassy's expenses not being finalized, it has been delayed again and again. Now, it is tentatively scheduled to travel on the Italian postal ship "Conte Rosso" on the thirteenth of next month. Initially, it was planned to send Secretary Ma Hongdao to Turkey in advance to prepare for the embassy site, etc. Now, Mr. Ma has been replaced by Counselor Wang Pengsheng, who is currently in London, England, to rush to Turkey.</p>
<p>Expense Budget</p>
<p>Regarding the embassy's expenses, the budget has been roughly finalized and has been approved by the Executive Yuan and is currently awaiting approval from the Central Political Council. The amount is roughly the same as that of the embassy in Japan. However, the exact amount has not yet been officially notified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, so it is not convenient to announce. My purpose here is to visit Minister of Finance Kong due to his illness. The embassy's expenses may be discussed at the same time.</p>
<p>Embassy Organization</p>
<p>As for the embassy's organization, there are Counselor Wang Pengsheng, Secretaries He Fengshan, Li Ju, Wang Shifu, Ma Hongdao, Attaché Lu Feng, and Chiefs Li Yaoyu and Yao Zhuxiu. These officials have all been appointed. Except for Counselor Wang, who will go to Turkey from London first, the rest will travel with me. In addition, my young son will also accompany me, but my wife will not go. As for the military attachés, they are appointed by the General Staff Headquarters. Whether the candidates have been finalized is unknown because it does not fall under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The location of the embassy will be in Ankara.</p>
<p>Sino-Turkish Commercial Treaty</p>
<p>In order to promote business between the two countries, it is necessary to sign a Sino-Turkish commercial treaty. However, I do not yet know whether I will be instructed by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to proceed with this upon my arrival. Generally, a decision will be made after I arrive in Turkey and exchange opinions with the authorities of that country. I have only just been appointed, so I have little to announce at the moment. After I arrive, I will strive to promote the relationship between China and Turkey so as not to fail the government's trust.</p>

<p>The Quota is 1,600 Kilograms</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday sent letters to the Electrical Machinery Silk Weaving Factory Industry and Silk and Satin Industry Association, saying, "Dear Sirs, on the 16th of this month, we received a letter from the International Trade Bureau of the Ministry of Industry, stating that we received Instruction No. 32033 from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that according to a consultation from the Embassy in Belgium, according to the results of the embassy's investigation to the Belgian Ministry of Industry, Chinese silk is also subject to quota restrictions. The import quota for Chinese silk this year is 1,600 kilograms, but in fact, the sales of Chinese silk to Belgium have never exceeded this quota. This shows the decline of China's silk trade. It is reasonable to attach a French record of the investigation to the Belgian Ministry of Industry and submit it for your examination, etc. The restrictions set by Belgium are closely related to China's silk counter-trade. We have correspondingly copied the original record for your reference, etc. Has the shipment of Chinese silk to Belgium never exceeded this quota? What is the impact of the import quota restrictions set by the Belgian government on China's silk counter-trade? We have combined the original French investigation record and added a Chinese translation for your deliberation and reply, and also informed the silk export merchants, etc., This order, etc. In this regard, we have copied the French investigation record and Chinese translation, and sent it to your association, hoping that you will convene silk industry merchants engaged in exports, state your opinions in detail, and reply in detail for reference, deliberation, and reporting.

<h3 id="e133">The Owners of Six Shanghai-Taiwan Ships Petition for a Strict Investigation of Pirates in Disguise <a href="#e133" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c133" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">133</a></h3>
<p>Civil Servants Will Also Be Inspected</p>
<p>Those Who Disobey Can Be Punished</p>
<p>Recently, piracy has been rampant, and cases of hijacking merchant ships have occurred frequently. In the past few days, pirates have been mixed on various ships, plotting to rob. Each shipping company has stepped up prevention, and the Shanghai-Taiwan route has been under even tighter surveillance. The captains of the Chuanshan, Zhoushan, Yili, Daxing, Taizhou, and other ships in this port have jointly petitioned for the inspection of public officials to prevent pirates from disguising themselves and mixing in. The original petition was submitted to the Zhejiang military police authorities by Fan Shangda, captain of Zhoushan, Zhou Shengli, captain of Yili, Zhuo Shiding, captain of Daxing, Zhang Jiuzhi, captain of Taizhou, Zhang Hecheng, captain of Chuanshan, and Lu Yizhi, captain of Dahua. They stated that the social economy is becoming increasingly exhausted, and</p>
<p>Pirate Ship Hijackings Are Becoming More and More Serious</p>
<p>Although the security is very strict, the tragedy of the hijackings has not subsided slightly. The reason is that there are many people in the crowd, and disguises are different. Inspection is not easy and it is easy to see the traces, which leads to this. Although the water and land police strictly check each ship upon arrival, it is easier to start searching ordinary people. However, for passengers wearing military uniforms, there are not a few who restrain themselves and submit to inspection, but there are really many who are unreasonable and resist stubbornly. The inspectors think that it is inevitable to be tolerant of on-duty personnel. Those with military positions also</p>
<p>Rely on Their Dignity as Inviolable</p>
<p>In fact, the authenticity of the symbols is difficult to recognize at a glance, and there are also many people who impersonate military police, with uniforms but no symbols. If bandits disguise themselves as military police and bring guns and equipment on board, and the inspectors are negligent, then the lives and property of a ship will be unimaginable. Thinking of this, they couldn't help but shudder. After discussion by Shangda and others, the only way is to petition the water and land military police authorities and other administrative and judicial agencies. When military police or public officials take a boat, please</p>
<p>Issue a Pass and Arrange Numbers</p>
<p>When disembarking, they must wear it uniformly, and please describe the style of the pass and post it on each ship. If you encounter a naval police inspection, you should hand over the pass and not make any unreasonable resistance, so that the service personnel of each ship can recognize it and facilitate inspection, then bandits will also find it difficult to trace. The benefits to the shipping merchants are not small, and so on. After the military police agencies signed and submitted their opinions, it was believed that in the case of ship hijackings in recent years, the bandits were disguised as passengers. If military police public officials refused to accept the inspection, Zhu Fei would maintain the safety of the merchant ship's voyage, and the shipowners asked to issue a pass to</p>
<p>The Naval Police Check and Identify Easily</p>
<p>The intention is very good, but it is related to the administration of the whole province. After being submitted to the Zhejiang Provincial Government, it was approved, "I have learned about the presentation. Military, police, and military agencies and public officials have official business or leave to return home. Except for special tasks and confidential documents, there are badges and documents to prove it. There is no need to issue a pass. Public officials, whether or not there are the above-mentioned badges and documents, shall be allowed to conduct legal inspections if they are confirmed to be suspected of carrying contraband. If they deliberately resist, they shall be reported to the competent authority for strict punishment (omitted below).</p>

<p>Tea Party to See Off Mei Lanfang (Mr. Mei in the Center, Mayor Wu on the Left, Russian Chargé d'affaires on the Right) (International News Agency Photo)</p>
<p>Mayor Wu's Farewell Speech</p>
<p>Mayor Wu Tiecheng of Shanghai gave a speech as chairman, saying, "Ladies and gentlemen, today the Shanghai Municipal Government and leaders from all walks of life are gathered here to hold a meeting to see off Mr. Mei Lanfang to the Soviet Union. Mr. Mei is an artist of our country. This trip is at the invitation of the Soviet Union, which is a glory for the people of our country. The Soviet Union's respect for art and the meaning of inviting Mr. Mei should also be respected and thanked by us. Therefore, today, on behalf of Shanghai, I express my gratitude to the Soviet Union, and I would like to say a few words about the hope for Mr. Mei's trip as a farewell message. Art is an important part of culture. Art is not limited by national boundaries, races, genders, and all classes of rich and poor. The Soviet Union's invitation this time is for art, and we also hope that Mr. Mei will uphold this purpose and bring the art of our country with a long history to the Soviet Union to perform, so as to live up to the original intention of the invitation. Eastern and Western cultures have their own origins, characteristics, and long history. Today, with the convenience of world transportation and frequent personnel contact, the cultures that were previously separated are now becoming closer and closer. Mr. Mei's trip actually contains the meaning of promoting mutual communication between Eastern and Western cultures. There is still an additional hope that art is deeply touching and can easily awaken people's kindness and goodwill. The Soviet Union's art has made great progress after the revolution, which is well known to the world. Moreover, China and the Soviet Union are the two major revolutionary nations in the world. Mr. Mei's trip is enough to take advantage of the opportunity of cultural communication to further enhance the friendship between the two major nations of China and the Soviet Union and the friendship between the two countries. The above points are our hope for Mr. Mei's trip, which is not only Mr. Mei's responsibility, but also the original intention of the Soviet Union's invitation. Today, we are holding a meeting to see off Mr. Mei, and we have specially put it forward as a gift."</p>
<p>Speech by the Soviet Russian Chargé d'affaires</p>
<p>Soviet Russian Chargé d'affaires and Consul General in Shanghai Spirvanik said, "I am very honored to be able to participate in such a grand tea party today, but I am not familiar with Chinese, so I can only use Russian instead to say a few words. Please forgive me. Dr. Mei is a Chinese playwright, famous in Europe and the United States, especially in Russia, where no one does not know the name of Dr. Mei. This time, Russia specially invited Dr. Mei to perform in Russia in admiration of Chinese drama and Dr. Mei's art. Now that Dr. Mei has agreed to go, it is not only my happiness, but also the enthusiasm of all circles in Russia."</p>
<p>Ambassador Yan's Speech</p>
<p>Dr. Yan Huiqing, our country's ambassador to Russia, said, "Mayor Wu, gentlemen, ladies, I returned from the Soviet Union last year and was welcomed by all walks of life. Today, I am welcomed by everyone again, and I dare not be worthy of it. In fact, I am like an old horse that cannot pull any cars, but when the country is in trouble, men and women should do their part. Therefore, I also have a responsibility. Today's grand event, the true role is Mei Lanfang, and I am just a supporting role. Since the restoration of diplomatic relations between China and Russia, today's grand tea party can be said to be groundbreaking. People from all walks of life gather together, which proves our country's goodwill towards the Soviet Union. China and the Soviet Union have great hope in the future. As the current ambassador to Russia, I feel very satisfied. Dr. Mei's visit to the Soviet Union this time represents our country in promoting art and communicating international culture. I hope that the friendship between China and Russia will become closer in the future."</p>
<p>Collection of Speeches from All Walks of Life</p>
<p>In addition, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan Chu Minyi, Central Committee Member Li Shizeng, Chairman of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce Yu Zuoting, and gentlemen and business leaders of this city Wang Xiaolai, Yu Qiaqing, etc. also gave speeches one after another. They generally hoped that Mr. Mei's visit to Russia would promote our country's inherent art abroad, promote international culture, and promote the friendship between China and Russia. They were deeply gratified.</p>
<p>Mei Lanfang's Reply</p>
<p>Dr. Mei Lanfang replied, "Chairman, gentlemen, I am very honored and grateful to have you gentlemen here today to see me off. I will never forget the words of encouragement and praise that you have just said, and I dare not be worthy of the praise. I remember four years ago, when I went to the United States, I also received guidance and support from you gentlemen. Now that I am going to the Soviet Union, I am still receiving the enthusiasm of you gentlemen, so that our country's drama can be promoted outside the country, so that Lanfang can also achieve many years of ambition. This is what Lanfang is very grateful for. This trip to Russia has been brewing for almost a year. As early as February last year, the Soviet government asked our country's embassy in Russia to invite Lanfang to perform. At that time, Lanfang did not dare to agree, because the Soviet Union is a country with the greatest literature, drama, and music. Since the revolution, their government has been vigorously promoting it, so the achievements have been rapid. If Lanfang goes to Russia, of course, he can take this opportunity to visit and study, and maybe he can get a little knowledge, but on the other hand, I am really afraid that my ability is not enough, and I am afraid that I cannot contribute the essence of Chinese drama to others, so I did not dare to agree immediately. Later, the Soviet Union repeatedly invited me, and telegrams and letters were sent in succession. They said that they wanted Lanfang to perform completely for research purposes. The meaning in the letter was very sincere. The government of our country, when Ambassador Yan heard about it, also advocated that Lanfang should agree because of diplomatic relations, so Lanfang dared to reluctantly take on the task. After the decision, the government authorities and Ambassador Yan and other gentlemen gave all kinds of assistance. The gentlemen in Shanghai also organized a drama association to guide and support, which was very enthusiastic. Lanfang is very grateful. Mr. Shi Liangcai, who first initiated the drama association, did not wait for Lanfang to go abroad, and he parted with us forever. Today, I cannot hear Mr. Shi's admonitions, which is something that Lanfang feels very sad about. Lanfang is very worried about this trip to Russia. Why? Because the performance methods of drama in the East and the West are completely different, and as I said just now, the Soviet Union is also a country with the greatest literature and drama. Can Lanfang's performance satisfy the people of the Soviet Union? So I feel very suspicious. I still hope that the gentlemen present today will give more guidance. This is what Lanfang is most looking forward to. After Lanfang performs in Russia, he will also go to various European countries to visit their dramas. However, whether he can have any insights after returning to China and report them is really uncertain. Speaking of it, I really feel very ashamed. Lanfang and the troupe have decided to accompany Ambassador Yan on a ship sent by the Soviet Union the day after tomorrow, all the way to Vladivostok, and then take the Siberian train to Moscow from Vladivostok. The time is very short. Just these two days, they have performed a few days of charity performances, so they don't have time to go to each of you gentlemen to say goodbye. Today, I will take this opportunity to say goodbye to you gentlemen, and when I return to China in the future, I will report everything to you gentlemen. Today, I thank you for your kindness and wish you all good health."</p>
<h3 id="e135">City Government Chemical Examination of Fire Well Truth <a href="#e135" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c135" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">135</a></h3>
<p>Underground Coal Quietly Awaits Reaction to Produce Marsh Gas</p>
<p>Thus, the Amount of Heat Accumulated Must Be Measured and Surveyed</p>
<p>The fire well at the Taizhou Guild Hall in this city, since it was discovered and announced by a reporter from the East China News Agency, has attracted a large number of onlookers. People in the community have also made various speculations, believing that there is a large amount of fire underground, which will be like a volcanic eruption. People in Shanghai have petitioned the city government to conduct a chemical examination. If there is accumulated heat, it can be extracted as fuel; otherwise, it would be a pity to abandon it. The city government has now sent personnel to conduct a chemical examination, and the result is that the underground of the fire well emits marsh gas due to the reaction of garbage, coal dust, etc. The heat is very weak and cannot be used as fuel. The results of the city government's chemical examination are recorded below.</p>
<p>Dispatching Personnel for Chemical Examination</p>
<p>After the discovery of the fire well last month, citizens such as Zhang Yin of this city immediately petitioned the city government to conduct a chemical examination. If it is natural heat accumulated underground, it can be used as industrial fuel. The city government, according to the petition, immediately sent personnel from the Industrial Testing Institute of the Social Affairs Bureau to conduct a chemical examination a few days ago, and the results are already available.</p>
<p>Cause of Fire</p>
<p>According to the analysis results of the bureau, the gas is marsh gas, commonly known as "natural gas," which is an organic substance generated by decay. It is thought that the guild hall is adjacent to Lujia浜 (creek). In recent years, the 浜 (creek) has been filled with garbage and coal dust. The garbage undergoes decomposition under the action of moisture, mixed pressure, and heat, forming this kind of gas. The chemical examination results are listed below. It escapes through cracks and penetrates the ground. The original abandoned well of the guild hall may be in the right place, and the ejection pressure is not strong, and the heat is very weak, making it difficult to use for industrial purposes. As for whether the underground storage is abundant, it must be determined by expert surveys.</p>
<p>Chemical Examination Results</p>
<p>The Industrial Testing Institute announced the various components contained in the fire well as follows: Marsh gas (Methane) 6.7%, Hydrogen (Hydrogen Hz) 12.8%, Nitrogen (Nitrogen Hz) 13.86%, Carbon Dioxide (Carbon Dioxide Coz) 2.18%, Carbon Monoxide (Carbon Monoxide Co.) 0.10%, Heating Value (Heating Valen s410.iikg Cal/liter)</p>
<h3 id="e136">Heavy Fog Permeated Yesterday Morning <a href="#e136" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c136" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">136</a></h3>
<p>Streetcars Move Slowly, Shops Burn Lights</p>
<p>Large Numbers of Jianghai Steamers Blocked Outside the Mouth</p>
<p>This port experienced heavy fog again yesterday morning. It was difficult to distinguish people at a slightly longer distance. The fog was especially heavy outside the Wusongkou (Wusong Port), causing rice and Shanghai steamers to be blocked outside the mouth. The situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>Seen in Heavy Fog</p>
<p>Last winter, this port experienced several heavy fogs. Since the beginning of spring, although there have been very few sunny days, heavy fog has not yet been seen. After dawn yesterday morning, heavy fog suddenly descended. By 8 o'clock, the fog became even thicker, making it difficult to distinguish people a few steps away. Streetcars moved slowly, and shops had to burn lights to operate. In addition, because the sunlight was blocked by the fog, the red color was like blood. Staring at it for a long time, the light was faintly visible.</p>
<p>Steamers Blocked Outside the Mouth</p>
<p>The heavy fog began to dissipate after 10 o'clock, causing water traffic to be hindered during this time. According to investigations from the Jianghai Customs and various shipping companies, as of 10 o'clock, the Customs steamer import license did not have a single word on it, indicating that a large number of steamers were blocked by the fog outside the mouth. According to investigations, the steamers blocked included the President Jefferson of the Dollar Steamship Company (from Japan to Shanghai), the General Pershing of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company (from Japan to Shanghai), the Tsukuba Maru of the Pacific Mail Steamship Company (from Hong Kong to Shanghai), and the Bomei Maru (from Japan to Shanghai). As for the Yangtze River steamers, there was the China Merchants Jiangda Steamer. The above-mentioned steamers only entered the port successively after the fog cleared, and their berthing time was all in the afternoon.</p>

<p>The Political Department of the French Concession Police received a notification on Saturday stating that a young man from Sichuan named Shi Changjie, 23 years old, was involved in reactionary activities in Shanghai and was currently hospitalized at the Chinese Red Cross General Hospital on Haimei Road. They were requested to assist in the arrest. Minister Shan dispatched detectives to the Red Cross Hospital, arrested Shi and brought him to the case. According to his confession, he resided at No. 4, Fengyu Lane, Sapposai Road. He was immediately sent to Guangci Hospital for treatment. Yesterday, Shi was brought before the Third Branch of the Jiangsu High Court for questioning. A request was made for a postponement, and the defendant was temporarily detained pending investigation and prosecution. After the presiding judge opened a collegial panel for interrogation, because it was related to politics, spectators were prohibited. After the interrogation, the court ordered a postponement for further investigation and interrogation. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

<h3 id="e139">Zhou Zhonghong's Descendants Litigate Over Ancestral Hall Property After His Martyrdom for Dredging the Wusong River <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>How to Treat Ancestors and the Locality</p>
<p>Judge Advises Mutual Concessions</p>
<p>Zhou Zhonghong, who served as the Zhifu (Prefect) of Songjiang Prefecture during the reign of Emperor Yongzheng of the Qing Dynasty, whose style name was Zizhen, later died in office due to supervising the dredging of the Wusong River. At that time, the gentry and people of Songjiang and Shanghai, recalling his virtues, built ancestral halls to repay his merits. By the eighth year of Daoguang, the Governor-General of Liangjiang, Jiang Youxian, and the Governor of Jiangsu, Tao Zhu, had posthumously awarded Zhou the title of Taipu Si (Grand Master of the Palace). During the Xianfeng period, the Shanghai Zhixian (Magistrate) Liu Qiu膏 again purchased 70 mu of ancestral hall property as fields, so that his descendants could collect rent to be used as expenses for the Spring and Autumn sacrificial rites. Currently, this field property is managed by Zhou Dadong of the Nomura Lumber Company at No. 86, Guangdong Road. Now, Zhou Shuzhi, Zhou Xueyu, Zhou Xuedan, Zhou Xuechu, Zhou Yuxian, Zhou Yuxiu, Zhou Rongcai, Zhou Qiuchi, Zhou Huanwen, etc., have jointly retained lawyer Zhang Ji to file a lawsuit against Zhou Dadong in the First Special District District Court for infringement of sacrificial property, claiming that the rental income from the sacrificial property, in addition to the sacrificial expenses, belongs to the descendants of the ancestral hall. It has always been handled according to the original plan. Initially, Zhou Dadong's uncle, Xinyuan, managed it. After Xinyuan's death, the defendant began to manage it. The plaintiffs and the defendant are both descendants of the Taipu Gong, so the ancestral hall property should be jointly owned by the plaintiffs and the defendant. However, since the defendant took over the management, the land price has been rising, and with great profits, he has gradually harbored the malicious intention of turning it into his personal property, changing the sacrificial field to his personal household name and independently disposing of it and privately renting it to foreign merchants. If they do not come out and claim the right to joint ownership, they will be deprived of it. For this reason, they request that the defendant Zhou Dadong hand over all the property certificates of the ritual fields and allow the plaintiffs and others to jointly manage it. The so-called renting to foreign merchants refers to Nomura Lumber Company. The company was founded by the Japanese, and Zhou Dadong is currently employed there. Zhou has a relationship with the company as host and guest, and there is no lack of considerable affection between them. Before filing the lawsuit, Zhou Hengzhi and others repeatedly investigated the details of the lease from the company, but to no avail. Therefore, they specifically requested in the complaint that the court notify the Japanese consul to investigate the contents of the lease with the company. Zhou Dadong also retained lawyers Yuan Yang'an and others to make a statement in defense after being accused, claiming that his great-grandfather, Peiwen, had served as the Fengsi Sheng (Sacrificial Student) in the Songjiang Zhou Ancestral Hall and had also been ordered by the Songjiang Prefecture and Shanghai County to be the Fengsi Sheng of the Shanghai Zhou Ancestral Hall. From his grandfather to his father to himself, he has guarded his position for generations. All the ancestral hall property was ordered by the Prefecture and County to be managed by the descendants of the ancestral hall. His father, Xinyuan, also paid the field price to the Shangbao Shatian Official Property Bureau and filed it with the Shanghai Municipal Land Bureau, obtaining ownership. It is definitely not something that other clansmen can covet. Moreover, this property was originally donated by local gentry and people and is specifically used for the annual repairs of the Shanghai Zhou Ancestral Hall and the salary of the Fengsi Sheng. It is not the inheritance of Zhonghong Gong, nor is it jointly owned by the descendants of Zhonghong Gong. The plaintiffs are not descendants of the Zhou Ancestral Hall. From where did they obtain the right of joint ownership? Moreover, Zhou Shuchun and Zhou Bingjun previously impersonated descendants of the ancestral hall to covet the ancestral hall property and had already reported it to the city government for protection, making it clear that other clansmen could not recklessly contend for it. It is obvious. He humbly asks to reject the original lawsuit. Yesterday morning, the judge of the First Special Court, Mo Runhua, opened a court to summon and interrogate. The lawyers of both parties made their statements in turn. Judge Mo believed that both parties belonged to the same clan and should be mindful of mutual concessions. He then persuaded both parties to go outside and try to reconcile. If there was no room for reconciliation, a date would be set for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e141">Da Hu Bank Runner Cheats for Overdraft Funds <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Privately Establishes Securities Firm to Overdraft from Da Hu</p>
<p>Fails in Operating Gold Speculation and Cotton Yarn Business</p>
<p>Qian Guanxian, a native of Ningbo, has been working as a runner at the Da Hu Bank at No. 510 Nanjing Road, with a monthly salary of 70 yuan, specializing in credit and loan matters. In January of last year, Deyu Securities Firm in Room 205, Securities Building, Hankou Road, applied to the bank for credit and overdraft of 5,000 yuan. The bank then ordered Qian to investigate. After Qian's investigation, he replied to the manager, saying that the firm was established by Chai Chuan貴, the president of Jiande Bank, and had excellent credit. The bank immediately approved Deyu's request and opened an account. By the end of last year's lunar calendar, Deyu Firm owed the Da Hu Bank an overdraft of 4,461.19 yuan. At that time, Qian suddenly disappeared from the bank. The deputy manager of Da Hu, Wang Hong赍, sent someone to the firm to collect the debt, but the firm had already closed down. There was only a Yan surnamed apprentice inside. When asked who the owner of Deyu Firm was, he replied that it was Qian Guanxian. Da Hu then realized that it had been deceived and reported it to the Lao Zha Police Station for investigation. Detective Wang Shanqing of the Chinese Detective Division went to Qian's residence on Tiantong Road to arrest him, but to no avail. Recently, it was discovered that Qian was often at No. 26, Lane 601, Zhoujiazui Road. Therefore, the detective waited there and arrested him on the previous day and took him back to the police station for detention. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Criminal Court of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the situation and prosecuted him for breach of trust under Article 366 of the Criminal Law. Da Hu also retained lawyer Hua Maosheng to appear in court. When interrogated, Qian Guanxian confessed that the Deyu firm was jointly established by him and Chai Chuan贵 with a capital of 10,000 yuan, operating securities, gold speculation, and cotton yarn businesses. Due to losses amounting to tens of thousands of yuan, it was unable to maintain operations. He did not deny the overdraft of more than 4,400 yuan from the Da Hu Bank. He also retained lawyers Fan Gang and Fan Qisheng to defend him. Judge Feng Shide reviewed the confession and, believing that the case still needed investigation, ordered a postponement of the hearing for a week. The defendant was returned to custody.</p>

After several telegrams from the central government summoning Zhou to Beijing to discuss, and after selecting "Orchid in the Valley" and "Sister Flowers" as entries, the first batch of representatives departed a week ago. The second batch of representatives, Zhou Jianyun and Hu Die, will also depart around the 20th, together with Ambassador Yan Huiqing and Mei Wanua, on a special ship. Zhou's wife, Chen Yujun, studied political economy at Waseda University in Japan and also plans to go with them to be responsible for investigation and recording work. Star Film Company is actively preparing a large number of photographs and printed materials (all with Russian translations) to be taken with them.</p>
<p>Friendly Farewell: Zhou's responsibilities at Star Film Company are very heavy. This time, he took time to go abroad and was in a hurry, and the preparations were quite busy.

<p>Zhou's Remarks: According to Zhou, this time, the Chinese film industry's expedition overseas is still a pioneering undertaking, and the significance is very important. Zhou said in his speech, in brief, "My duties in the film industry are heavy, but I am very interested in film culture. Therefore, I am very willing to take the opportunity to participate in the international film exhibition to take a look at the cultural construction of the new Soviet Union. There will be much to learn from the stones of other mountains. Moreover, the spirit of the Russians burying their heads in hard work should also be worthy of our people's imitation."</p>
<p>Investigation Outline: After attending the Soviet International Film Exhibition, Zhou also plans to conduct a detailed investigation of the Soviet film industry and has already drawn up the following investigation outline: (1) The current Soviet film administrative jurisdiction organs, organization system, film censorship, tax rules, import procedures, etc.; (2) Current status of the film industry; (3) Film schools; (4) Construction and equipment of photography studios; (5) Movie theaters; (6) Music and drama; (7) Related film books and magazines; (8) Whether there is a market for Chinese films; (9) Soviet impressions and criticisms of China's participation in the exhibition; (10) Opinions of overseas Chinese on domestic films; (11) The course of the Soviet International Film Exhibition; (12) Others.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Reason for Wang Boying's Kidnapping <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>Instigated by Wang's Friend Yin Zhibai's Chauffeur Ma Shenzhong</p>
<p>After Being Kidnapped, Ma Secretly Inquired About All Movements of the Wang Family</p>
<p>Wang Boying, manager of Da Ji Money Exchange and director of Da Dong Bookstore, was suddenly kidnapped by bandits at the entrance of Changfeng Lane, Tongyun Road, on the evening of the 9th of this month and hidden at No. 14, Rongfu Lane, West Aihans Road, French Concession, and sent a letter demanding a ransom of 200,000 yuan. After the case, the Chinese and Western detectives of the Chengdu Road Police Station arrested the bandits Wang Liugen, Wang Cai氏, Zhang Zhengguo, and Yang Kong氏, and killed one bandit named Yao Maoqing on the spot, rescued the hostage, and sent them to the First Special Court for interrogation and detention. The details have been recorded in this newspaper. It is now known that the Chinese detectives Feng Baishun, Cui Chengke, and Huang Fusen, Xu Dezhong, and others who handled the case have been working hard to investigate for several days and have made further progress, and have arrested the insider Ma Shenzhong, a native of Nanjing, and his accomplice Hu Amao (ie, coppersmith Amao), a native of Jiading, the day before yesterday. Ma has been working as a chauffeur for Yin Zhibai at No. 9, Gui仁 Lane, Maigen Road. Yin and Wang Boying are friends and neighbors and often visit each other. Therefore, Ma is very familiar with Wang Boying's family situation, as well as the residence of his beloved concubine and when he enters and exits. He colluded with Wang Liugen and others to carry out the kidnapping. Afterwards, he also instigated the bandits to send a letter to his master Yin Zhibai, asking him to help the hostage prepare the money, and secretly inquired about the Wang family's movements, whether they had reported it to the police or were willing to pay the ransom. Because Ma and the hostage knew each other, it was inconvenient for him to show his face in the bandit's den. Therefore, Ma hired Hu Amao to act as a go-between. If they got the ransom in the future, they would share it according to the shares. The method was very clever. However, the heavens are just, and the detectives found out the secret, so Ma was arrested and detained. The police sent Ma and Gu to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court yesterday morning, requesting permission to detain them and try them together with Wang Liugen and others. The police lawyer Zhang Tianyin explained the above situation, saying that Ma Shenzhong was confessed by the arrested criminal Wang Liugen, and Hu Amao was confessed by Ma, so he was arrested, and requested to be tried together. When interrogated, Ma confessed that he had been a chauffeur at Yin Zhibai's house for three or four years. Yin and Wang Boying were friends and often interacted, so he was familiar with Wang's family situation. This kidnapping case was first discussed in Wen 室 on the second floor of the Dacheng Apartment. Wang Liugen and the deceased were both present, and they asked me about the time and place of the hostage's entry and exit, which I told them. I was not present during the kidnapping, and I had never been to the bandit's den in Rongfu Lane. Only the day after Wang was kidnapped, I saw the news in the newspaper and learned that they had already started. So, I sent Hu Amao to the bandit's den to find out the situation. I learned that the hostage was guarded by Wang 貿根 and the deceased. A day later, Wang Liugen asked Amao to come and told me to go. Because it was inconvenient for me, I met at Room 56 of the Siming Hotel. Wang told me that the hostage was very anxious to get out, and although he had contacted him by phone, there was no result, and asked me about the recent situation of the Wang family, whether they had reported it to the police, and I replied that I didn't know. When questioned, Hu Amao confessed that he was entrusted by Ma, which was not denied. After Judge Liu Yugui reviewed the confession, he ordered Ma and Hu to be detained and tried together with Wang Liugen and others on Friday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e146">North and South Rice Trade Associations in Shanghai Halt Transactions Yesterday to Discuss the Issue of Final Payments in Silver Dollars <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Attended by Over a Hundred Member Representatives</p>
<p>Petitioning the Social Affairs Bureau for Relief</p>
<p>The North and South Rice Trade Associations of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Guild halted transactions yesterday to address the issue of collecting final payments from rice shops in silver dollars. Over one hundred and seventy member representatives attended the general meeting, resolving to adopt a signing system for future final payment transactions in silver dollars, and to submit a petition to the Social Affairs Bureau for record-keeping and relief. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Halt of Transactions for One Day</p>
<p>The North and South Rice Trade Associations of the Shanghai Bean and Rice Industry Guild, in preparation for the joint meeting of the association on the 15th of this month regarding the collection of final payments in silver dollars, halted transactions for one day yesterday. The general meeting of all members of the North and South Rice Trade Associations was convened at the Cuixiu Hall in the Yuyuan Garden in the city at 1:00 PM, resulting in no rice market yesterday.</p>
<p>Convening of the General Meeting</p>
<p>Following the confirmation by the joint meeting, an emergency general meeting of members was convened yesterday afternoon at 1:00 PM. Representatives from member firms, including Yu Yuan, Yi Yuan, Yong Da, Wan Xing, Xin Chang, Yi Xing Feng, Yi Chang Xing, Xin Xing Chun, Yuan Yu, He Feng Tai, Rui Chang Fa, De Feng, San Tai, Yi Shun Xing, Cheng Feng, Cheng Tai, Da Da, Yu Da De, Tong Xing Yong, Yu Sheng Gong, Da Fa, Yi Xing, Yong Shun Tai, Yu Chang Tai, Ju Xing Cheng, Yu Da De, Da Chang Shen, Wan Tai Xiang, Yuan Shun, Wan Sheng Tai, Xie Chang De, Wan Sheng Xing, Yu Tai Xing, Yuan Yu, Yuan Sheng Chang, Ding Tai Mei, Yi Tai Xiang, Hua Da, Tong Xing Yong, Ding Tai De, Yuan Mao, Wan Xing, Yuan Sheng Run, Ju Tai, San Tai, Run Shou Feng, Heng Xing Xie, Xie Kang, Jian Ting, Ding Feng, Yong Feng, Heng Xing Yi, Wei Yuan Feng, Hong Sheng, Rui Kang, Heng Chang Yi, Tong Tai, Heng Yi Gong, Xin Chang, and others, totaling over one hundred and seventy people, including Gu Xin Yi, Zhu Zi Xiang, and Yan Xiao Quan, attended.</p>
<p>Important Matters Resolved</p>
<p>Chaired by Gu Xin Yi, the discussion focused on changing the final payment from small silver to large silver. (Traditionally, transactions between rice shops and rice merchants involved rounding off amounts less than one yuan, with ten small silver coins considered one yuan. Rice shops often used double silver coins to represent silver dollars when paying rice merchants for three to four dan of rice.) During the meeting, representatives from various member firms expressed their opinions. After three o'clock, a consensus had not yet been reached. Finally, the majority agreed, and for the sake of prudence, decided to use a signing system, where those who signed would implement final payments in silver dollars, and those who did not would indicate their opposition. The result was that eight out of ten agreed to switch to silver dollars.</p>
<p>Petition for Relief</p>
<p>Furthermore, the association, deeply concerned that the issue of final payments might lead to unrest, decided to submit the important matters discussed yesterday to the Social Affairs Bureau for approval and record-keeping, before implementing them on a set date. According to a committee member of the association, speaking to a reporter from Hua Dong News Agency, although the final payment issue has existed since the market began, it has always been in small silver. However, at a time when all commodities are generally priced in silver dollars, if the rice industry continues with the old practices, the losses to rice merchants would be significant. Moreover, rice shops sell to consumers in silver dollars, regardless of whether it is calculated by the dan, dou, sheng, or he. It is reasonable to forgive the rice merchants for changing the final payment from small silver to large silver.</p>

<p>Meyrier, the former French Consul-General in Shanghai, has served in Shanghai for three years and has now left his post to return to his country. Shanghai Mayor Wu Tiecheng, considering Meyrier's harmonious relations with the Chinese people during his tenure, specifically requested the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to forward a request to the National Government to award him a medal in order to foster friendship. It is now known that the Municipal Government has received a letter from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs stating that the National Government has ordered that Meyrier be granted the Red and White Ribbon with Jade Medal. Once the medal is issued, personnel will be dispatched to the French Consulate General to forward it to Meyrier.</p>

<p>Rumors of Departure from Shanghai are Inaccurate</p>
<p>According to Shen Shi News Agency, Li Xiaosheng, who came to Shanghai from Hong Kong some time ago as a representative of Mr. Hu Hanmin, has been staying in Shanghai for many days and has met with Wang Jingwei, Wang Chonghui, Li Shizeng, and others. He is still in Shanghai to handle personal matters. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Li traveled by car from his residence on Yuyuan Road to visit Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi on West Asia Times Road, inquiring about Kong's illness and engaging in discussions. It happened that the newly appointed envoy to Turkey, He Yaozu, also visited Kong, so Li did not meet with Kong until around 11:00 AM. He left at 11:30 AM to return home. Previous rumors that Li had returned to Hong Kong or gone north have now been confirmed as inaccurate.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Embezzlement by Bank Employee at Bank of Communications <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>Ge Xinghua, Manager of Xiaguan Branch, Embezzles Public Bonds</p>
<p>For days, rumors have circulated about embezzlement by an employee of the Bank of Communications. A reporter from this newspaper visited the head office to investigate, and the general situation is as follows: Since General Manager Tang took office, the Bank of Communications has been very strict with the inspection of accounts of various branches. Recently, the manager of the Nanjing branch was transferred, and personnel were sent to Beijing to inspect the accounts and inventory of the branch and its subordinate branches. It was discovered that Ge Xinghua, acting manager of the Xiaguan branch (formerly the chief teller of the Nanjing branch), had embezzled funds. After investigation, the auditor escorted Ge to the head office for questioning. Ge admitted that during his tenure as chief teller of the Nanjing branch, he had embezzled over 400,000 yuan in bonds. Now that the head office has transferred the manager of the Nanjing branch, he could no longer cover up the embezzlement, so he used the embezzled funds to repurchase bonds. Ge has written a report stating that friends and colleagues had lent him money, and that his assets could repay about half of the amount. The main culprit, Ge Xinghua, and those involved in the case, such as Jiang Chanshan, manager of the Nanjing branch, and other staff, have been formally handed over to the local court by the head office for strict investigation and recovery of losses.</p>

<p>The Shanghai District Court Prosecutor's Office confiscated illegal narcotics from various police stations, such as opium and caffeine, from July 1 to the end of December. The total amount included 431 catties and 199 taels and 1 fen of opium, 8,678 taels of fake opium, 18 catties and 10 taels of opium dross, 3,867 red pills and 67 catties and 36 taels of red pills, 3 catties and 15 taels of morphine, 1,034 opium bubbles, 2 catties and 10 taels of opium paste, and 2,748 pieces of opium paraphernalia and ashes. The number of items was not counted for sealed items with specified weights; multiple items combined in a sealed package were counted as one item, whether it was a package of opium pills or a small amount of opium bubble. Chief Prosecutor Zhong Shangbin had already created a register and reported it. Based on the instruction No. 4033 from the Chief Prosecutor of the Jiangsu High Court, it was decided to publicly burn the narcotics on the 18th of this month. Chief Prosecutor Zhong sent letters to various agencies, requesting them to send personnel to supervise the event. Yesterday was the designated date. At 1:00 PM, representatives arrived successively, including Yu Hao from the Jiangsu High Court Prosecutor's Office, Ju Zhijing and Zhou Daguang from the First Special District Court, Wang Sima and Zhao Yifen from the Second Special District Court, Huang Yunshu from the Shanghai Municipal Government, Zhao Wanli from the Songhu Garrison Headquarters, Lu Zonghan from the Jianghai Customs, Ren Bin from the Municipal Party Headquarters, Chen Shisheng from the Shanghai Municipal Police Bureau, and Xu Yuyin from the Shanghai County Public Patrol Bureau. Chief Prosecutor Zhong, accompanied by Dean Shen, welcomed the representatives and led them to the living room for a brief conversation. Chief Prosecutor Zhong then instructed judicial police chief Chen Junfang and police officers Chen Xihui and Gu Hanqing to supervise all bailiffs in transporting the confiscated narcotics from the exhibit storage to the open space behind the court, where they were piled up. Meanwhile, Chief Prosecutor Zhong led the representatives to the thatched shed erected behind the court to begin counting and verifying the items. Chen ordered the police to place all the narcotics on pine firewood, sprinkle them with kerosene and salt, and set them on fire. The flames soared into the air. After three bell rings, the burning was completed. The representatives took their leave. The remaining ashes were placed in hemp bags and transported to the Huangpu River to be discarded, in order to eliminate the toxic fumes.</p>

<p>The Huadong Commercial Savings Bank on Ningbo Road went into liquidation last year due to the impact of the economic downturn. After liquidation, the liquidators believed that the bank's manager, Pang Fengzhi, had committed acts of embezzlement and breach of trust, so they hired a lawyer to file a criminal lawsuit with the First Special District Court, along with a civil lawsuit, demanding compensation of more than 49,000 yuan. Pang hired lawyer Gao Junxiang to defend him, refuting each point of the plaintiff's claim in detail. The case was heard yesterday afternoon at 2:30 PM by judge Wu Tingqi. Because the embezzlement and breach of trust alleged by the plaintiff could not be established, Pang Fengzhi was found not guilty. The civil lawsuit was transferred to the civil court for handling.</p>

<p>Grand Spring Banquet at the Branch of the Weiya Restaurant</p>
<p>The branch of the Weiya Restaurant is a famous Cantonese restaurant in Shanghai, known for its exquisite dishes and delicious cooking, which has long been praised by the public. Its luxurious decoration and thoughtful service are especially appreciated. Because the Weiya Restaurant's old store on North Sichuan Road and its branch on Fourth Horse Road are both very successful, the owner of the restaurant, in order to thank customers for their patronage over the years during the new spring season, hosted a banquet at the branch last night. Prominent figures from the Party, government, business, and intellectual circles were invited, totaling three or four hundred people. The gathering was full of talent and the atmosphere was lively.</p>

<h3 id="e158">Opinions and Hopes Regarding the New Life Movement <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Yuanruo</p>
<p>Any movement, the movement itself, is not our goal, but merely a method to promote a certain goal. Meetings, speeches, and newspaper publicity are only means of the movement, not the purpose of the movement. Any advocate of a movement, if he mistakes the means for the end, will inevitably fail. (See my book, "The Qualities That Advocates of the New Life Movement Should Possess," Chen Bao, 23, 11, 21.)</p>
<p>China's recent history has an important feature that is "movement-oriented." The purpose of past movements was undoubtedly to save the country from its perilous state and revive the dispirited people. However, if we use an objective attitude to conduct a fair review, all the grand and enthusiastic movements mostly only had temporary excitement and failed to achieve universal and practical results, lacking sincerity. This is not my personal subjective assertion, but a historical lesson that everyone who truly cares about the country should jointly bear.</p>
<p>The New Life Movement is, of course, a movement to transform the nation and revive the people. (See my book, "National Revival and Transformation of People's Lives," Chen Bao, 23, 11, 21.) But if we want to realize its such a great mission, we must first avoid falling into the past failures of all national salvation movements, thoroughly eliminate those corrupt elements who are realistic, opportunistic, double-dealing, deceiving the world and stealing fame, and whose words do not match their actions. If the New Life Movement is destroyed and dies out by these corrupt elements, it is better to temporarily "my way does not prevail" than to let them deceive the world with grand words and lose credibility with the people. Losing credibility with the people is the most dangerous thing in politics. The reason why the Chinese people are not interested in politics or other public affairs and are unwilling to be serious, although it is because political education is not developed, is actually a problem worth considering. If we want to promote government orders and stimulate the people's interest in politics, we should first "show the people faith." Otherwise, any movement will only drive the masses to the wrong path of vanity, pride, and meanness, and our great and pure nation will only become increasingly degenerate. I, personally, dare to say that I have always been a practitioner of the New Life Movement. Of course, I am extremely unwilling for my words to unfortunately come true, and especially because the life of the nation is already so critical, we cannot afford to make the same mistake again and again, making this movement, which bears the important mission of recreating the life of the nation, take the same old path. Therefore, with my full enthusiasm, I put forward the following three minimum hopes that should be achieved:</p>
<p>1.  I hope that in the future, every practitioner of the New Life Movement will try to avoid hypocrisy, show sincerity, match words with actions, and practice what they preach.</p>
<p>2.  I hope that people from all walks of life will unanimously and thoroughly understand right and wrong and uphold justice, because only in a society where right and wrong are clear and justice is upheld will everyone be willing to abide by etiquette and righteousness, and be able to understand integrity and shame.</p>
<p>3.  I hope that the government authorities will thoroughly and strictly define rewards and punishments, revitalize discipline, and eliminate corruption, because only in a country where rewards and punishments are clear, corruption is eliminated, and discipline is revitalized will society have right and wrong, justice, and the people will understand etiquette and righteousness, know integrity and shame, have discipline, and observe order. Otherwise, in a deformed society where good people are always at a disadvantage, who would be willing to restrain themselves and be good? (See my book, "The Life Movement and Political Reform," Chen Bao New Year's Day Special Issue.)</p>
<p>The above three hopes are theoretically very ordinary, but practically the most important. As long as they are known and can be acted upon, practice is not difficult. In the future, our government and people must truthfully and genuinely practice these three points in a down-to-earth manner, and China's politics, society, and people's hearts will have the possibility and reality of thorough transformation, and our Chinese nation will have the hope of revival. Written at Zilijai in Shanghai on the first anniversary of the New Life Movement, 1935.</p>

<p>— (Xu Xiaoting)</p>
<p>Society is cold and ruthless, and people's hearts are frozen. Whether it is a fallen comrade or a poor friend who has lost economic autonomy, in modern society, if you ask for help, it is like a goat begging for mercy from a hungry tiger. You cannot get warmth and sympathy.</p>
<p>Although the King of Hell is spit out of the mouths of Taoist women and is the authority who holds the power of life and death, the authority of bandits in the countryside is even more absolute than that of the King of Hell.</p>
<p>If there are no evil people in the world, society can be peaceful. If there are no mediocre people in the world, the country can be strong. If there are no idle people in the world, the local area can be prosperous.</p>
<h3 id="e160">Prohibition and Promotion <a href="#e160" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c160" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">160</a></h3>
<p>— Shi Didi</p>
<p>In the past year or two, in various vibrant cities, a floor-length gown can be seen on those beautiful women. As high heels step with a rhythmic sound, this soft corner of the dress waves, showing an even more graceful demeanor. It is said that the popularity of long clothes also has a very twisted experience. A few years ago, the silk merchants of Paris, in order to deal with the surplus of their own goods, devised a way to contact fashionable seamstresses, turning light short dresses into flowing long dresses. When women had to lift their skirts and move slowly, the silk merchants' products gained full sales. I remember last summer, not wearing socks was temporarily popular among fashionable women, and the sock industry was deeply affected. Our merchants also came up with some clever methods, unanimously requesting the government to prohibit bare feet, in order to correct the declining morals and maintain commerce. But it had little effect. The methods of these Paris silk merchants, whether ingenious or not, are truly incomparable.</p>
<p>Today, women's every move is subject to strict restrictions, as if social unrest, economic decline, and all the unfortunate events that occur are caused by women's novel costumes and attractive smiles. So, a lot of voices of prohibition came. Prohibiting the wearing of floor-dragging cheongsams, prohibiting female students from applying rouge and powder, and prohibiting other things, really makes people dizzy and at a loss. These complex prohibitions are really not easy to understand clearly, and it is somewhat dangerous to be careless. However, perhaps because most women do not and do not want to understand the reasons for those prohibitions, they still apply powder, still apply rouge, and the floor-dragging gowns have not been shortened by even a fraction of an inch. This exactly matches the saying that women are irrational creatures.</p>
<p>Yes, those glamorous clothes and eye-catching jewelry not only exacerbate the decadence of the end of the century but also send tens of millions of dollars to other countries, without gaining anything practical, except to hasten their own race to the road of destruction. Prohibition, no matter how strict, is justified and cannot be criticized. However, we have heard that for the handling of everything, prohibition only belongs to the negative end. Here, we might as well learn the methods of the silk merchants, using the only common ailment of the women's world—the trend of fashion—to mobilize those famous boudoir beauties, noblewomen, red film stars, and singers and dancers, as long as they are figures that the women's world pays attention to, to rise up and set an example, creating a new fashion. At that time, there will be no need for prohibition, no need for strict orders, and they will obediently follow another path.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Record of Foreign Pigs Coming to China <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Kang Jianzhaifu</p>
<p>Wuxi Educational College and the Agricultural College of Zhongda jointly ordered twenty-one high-quality pigs from the United States at the end of last year, which arrived in Shanghai by the ×× President a few days ago. The college specially dispatched a "commissioner" to welcome and pick them up, transferred them to the Beijing-Shanghai train, and arrived at the Wuxi station, where they were transferred to rickshaws to be pulled away. Unexpectedly, one of them escaped from its cage midway and ran into a blacksmith's shop. That day was the eve of the Lunar New Year's Eve. The shop owner thought that a live pig entering the door was very unlucky and refused to let it go. The commissioner got out of the car to negotiate, and after the police persuaded him, the conditions were agreed: the Educational College would send someone to the pig's place to burn a "six-eyed" pig head the next day to return the profit, guaranteed by the Public Security Bureau.</p>
<p>In order to win over the public and welcome back the foreign pigs, the Educational College immediately sent a farmer from the college the next day with a small pig's head, a skinny chicken, a four-inch-long carp, a string of yuanbao, three loud sounds of "Shang Sheng," and five hundred firecrackers to the pig's blacksmith shop to fulfill the treaty. The foreign pig was then happily carried back.</p>
<p>It is said that each foreign pig cost about 25 US dollars, and the freight cost about 20 US dollars per pig, plus other miscellaneous expenses. Each pig costs 160 Chinese yuan. That kind of pig has a particularly strong growth force. Four months after birth, the largest has grown to 165 pounds. This pig is called Chester White and has white fur all over its body. Another kind is called Poland China, which is a mixed breed of Middle and Poland, with mostly black and little white fur. The most peculiar is Duroc Jersey, whose coat is pure yellow. Because the name is quite difficult to remember, it is jokingly translated as "university professor."</p>

<p>A pair of feet from east to west;</p>
<p>Dimples that smile north and south!</p>
<p>Charlie Chaplin, the American silver screen star, has those particularly peculiar feet, whose gait is extremely comical. In Hefei city, Anhui, I often saw a man, about forty years old, who was a dwarf, but not extremely so; his feet were also like Chaplin's, turned outwards to the left and right, forming a straight line, and his gait, without any learning, was naturally amusing! However, Chaplin's is fake; this one is real. If the film industry could discover him, he would be a treasure!</p>
<p>Ms. Hu Die, the silver screen star of Shanghai, has a dimple on her "left cheek," and she is beautiful, needless to say—have you gentlemen been to Tianjin and Beijing? Do you remember Ms. Wang Fengyong, who sings Xihe Dagu (a type of storytelling with drum accompaniment)? Her voice, lingering and unbroken, truly surpasses the Shandong Li Hua Pian (a type of folk opera), and I fear that even the Black Girl and White Girl that Lao Can praised in the Baotu Spring were not her equal! She is also most beautiful, with a dimple on her "right cheek." She is from Yixian, Hebei, and often says, "The mountains and waters of western Beijing are comparable to those of the southeast." It is not surprising that beautiful women are produced there, but it is truly unique and rare that she can be paired with Ms. Hu Die, one left and one right, forming north and south smiling dimples!</p>

<p>The waiter glanced at the Hu mother and daughter and smiled at him: "It's rare to see Mr. Zhang being so enthusiastic." Having said that, he smiled and left. Zhang Jiefu knew very well that the waiter had misunderstood, but whether he acted as a matchmaker for Cheng Shengqian or for Chief Gao, it would not harm his own status. After the waiter left, he originally wanted to go back to the window of the Western restaurant to take a look. However, with these two poor women in the room, there were many things scattered about, which was not very appropriate. Therefore, he suppressed his impulse and did not leave, but chatted idly with Mrs. Hu. Mrs. Hu was surprised that this old man was so talkative and jovial, and she was very happy. After talking for about ten minutes, the waiter had not returned with a reply, and he stretched his head to look outside the door, but there was no sign of him. It was just the front and back yards from here to the hall, why was it taking so long? Thinking of this suspicious point, he put his hands behind his back and paced back and forth in the room, trying to reduce the frustration in his heart. However, after walking back and forth four or five times, he felt frustrated again, thinking, "Even if poor people are reliable, if I go out, I will only be standing in the yard. A woman who has just come to a big city would not have the nerve to take things from the room casually. Even if they did take something, they are so thin that they would not be able to hide it anywhere. In that case, I should be bold and go out to take a look." Thinking this way, he decided to walk to the window of the back wall of the Western restaurant. When he looked inside, Cheng Shengqian was talking to a man in a Western suit on one side. Jiefu did not recognize the director of construction here, and thought to himself, "Could this man in the Western suit be him?" So he quietly moved his feet, flashed to the side of the window, and stuck half of his face out to look inside the window. He saw the man in the Western suit frowning and smiling bitterly, and though he was saying something, it was not audible because his voice was soft. (136)</p>

<p>— Originally Written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Once the program was decided, someone went down to prepare.</p>
<p>All the equipment for performing operas was purchased very completely in the palace, and people managed it very carefully, so it was not difficult to get what was needed when it was time to use it. All the backdrops, costumes, and so on were exquisite, and appropriate attire was available for spring, summer, autumn, and winter. Those who hear these words may not be able to fully believe them, thinking that this is very impossible in fact; however, it is true! All day long, all year round, they were always tailoring costumes or sending well-made designs to Suzhou or Guangdong to be custom-made, always sparing no expense. Although they had not come east with us this time, we had already loaded all kinds of things used for performing operas from the carriage, leaving nothing out. Just taking care of this item, such as musical instruments, was the responsibility of an old eunuch, who had a dozen or twenty young eunuchs as assistants. So no matter what opera we performed, as long as we ordered it, we could always put it on. Half of the reason was the completeness of the attire, but the biggest reason was that the eunuchs who performed the operas, whether they were male roles, female roles, painted-face roles, or clowns, could all sing many operas and could be put together at any time without any roles missing.</p>
<p>To perform an opera, there must be a stage. Fortunately, although the buildings of these palaces in Shengjing were very old, there was a stage built in the open space in front of a grand hall. Of course, its age was also very old! The format was the same as the stages we usually see in temples, only one story high, but the location was relatively spacious. (247)</p>

<p>— Pan Zhaogan</p>
<p>It was a winter midnight. The headwind howled against his body, as if ten thousand sharp needles were pricking him. White snow covered the earth, and the beautiful village had become a pure white color. Because of the reflection of the light, when viewed from afar, it looked like a piece of uneven glass.</p>
<p>At this time, the people of the whole village had quietly gone to seek their sweet dreams. At the end of the small bridge, on the paper window of a birdcage-like hut made of straw, a faint light flickered.</p>
<p>An old woman over sixty years old lay on a broken plank bed, covered with a broken cotton quilt, unable to resist the invasion of the severe cold, constantly shivering, her face pale and frightening, but as if she were looking forward to something.</p>
<p>"Mother... Mother... I'm back." Accompanied by this weak voice, a beautiful girl, about twenty years old, came in.</p>
<p>"How... was it today?" The old woman struggled to say on the bed.</p>
<p>"Alas! Today" It's cold, and most of the customers are shrinking back and not happy to come out. I only got two dollars, how can I afford to hire a doctor and buy medicine? There's no rice for tomorrow either, alas! As she spoke, she sighed and brushed the snow off her body.</p>
<p>"............" There was silence for a while.</p>
<p>"Hey, hey, is Xiaozhen back?" Suddenly an old man walked in, his face showing a cunning look.</p>
<p>"Um! I'm back." "Fourth Master!" Xiaozhen said, her voice trembling severely.</p>
<p>"Haha! How's the money? The money!"</p>
<p>"I'm really very sorry. Fourth Master, please come and get it tomorrow!"</p>
<p>"Hey! That's not possible, I must have it today."</p>
<p>Xiaozhen's frostbitten face suddenly turned gray. She handed the two dollars that she had planned to use for medical expenses to Fourth Master tremblingly.</p>
<p>"Um! Good, you really don't know how to appreciate favors!" Fourth Master took the money and strode away, muttering in his mouth.</p>
<p>"Mother, the money is gone, what should we do? Oh! How about this! Let's borrow money from Uncle Cheng."</p>
<p>At this time, the old woman had fallen asleep, her face paler than before, and her body was constantly shivering.</p>
<p>Xiaozhen waited for her to stop responding and ran out quickly.</p>
<p>In the end, Xiaozhen couldn't withstand the severe cold and succumbed to the northwest wind. She returned to the house. She thought there was half a loaf of bread left over from yesterday that could be used to fill her mother's stomach and ward off the cold.</p>
<p>She walked into the kitchen, wanting to boil tea to drink, and when she saw that her mother was not breathing, she quickly threw down the bread, ran to the bed, and stood there stunned. After a long time, she cried "Mom:" and fainted.</p>
<p>The northwest wind was still blowing outside, and everything, everything, was still the same as before, only there was a faint and continuous sound coming from inside the house.</p>
<p>"Mother... Mother... how could you bear to abandon your poor daughter... and leave alone?"</p>

<p>— Wu Tiecheng</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek initiated the New Life Movement in Nanchang last year, the whole country has followed suit, and people at home and abroad have responded enthusiastically! As a result, it has developed into a movement, forming a trend. All people of insight regard this as a great step forward in the national revival movement. Even foreigners who spy on our country cannot help but admire and sigh, believing that the rise and fall of the new China depends solely on the success or failure of the New Life Movement! In this day and age, if one does not change current customs, it is impossible for the country not to perish! Tracing back to the late Qing Dynasty, when the doors were opened and the country was beset by internal and external troubles, the shortcomings of the nation were fully exposed. Zeng Guofan and Li Hongzhang were shocked by the strong armor and sharp weapons of the powers. Therefore, they sent students and competed to manufacture things, thinking of using the knowledge of sound, light, electricity, and chemistry to continue the decline and restore the country. However, merely relying on the imitation of technology could not help to renew the national policy! Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao took advantage of this and launched the Reform Movement, hoping to adopt the dross of constitutional government from the Eastern neighbor as the model for reform in China. This was putting the cart before the horse! Sun Yat-sen, the leader of our party, was able to perceive the hidden and understand the subtle, with great wisdom and profound thinking, and took the Three Principles of the People as the guideline for revolution and national construction. In recent years, although worries and disasters have arisen repeatedly, and there has been internal turmoil, the central government has been consolidated, the political situation has remained unchanged, and the great cause of national unity and national revival has already begun. Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, seeing that the founding and independence of the country depend on the rise of the people, again advocated the New Life Movement, to practice the virtues of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame in the daily life of clothing, food, housing, and transportation, so that everyone understands propriety, righteousness, knows integrity and shame, takes responsibility, and obeys discipline. This is his painstaking effort to awaken the deaf and enlighten the foolish, which is enough to rectify customs, establish national norms, and open historical records. Who would say it is inappropriate!</p>
<p>Chairman Chiang Kai-shek explained the New Life Movement, saying: "The New Life Movement is a revolution in the life of all our people." He explained the meaning of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, saying: "Propriety is order; it is an attitude of being well-behaved. Righteousness is suitability; it is a righteous behavior. Integrity is clarity; it is a clear distinction between right and wrong. Shame is knowledge; it is a sincere awareness." He also said: "Shame is the motive of behavior, integrity is the guide of behavior, righteousness is the practice of behavior, and propriety is the expression of behavior. The four are interconnected; they originate from shame, are clarified by integrity, are practiced in righteousness, and are expressed in propriety. They need each other and complement each other, and none can be missing!" All of these are subtle words and profound meanings, and have already been understood by the whole country! I, Tiecheng, am not clever, and I want to do my best to offer my humble opinion, in order to seek correction from my comrades and compatriots, that is, the new line of the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>From a historical perspective, the Chinese nation is indeed a great and excellent nation. However, in the past hundred years, accumulated habits have been passed down, and there are indeed undeniable weaknesses. In terms of public life, there is no organization, no discipline, and no responsibility. In terms of private life, there is no organization, no discipline, and no responsibility. The lower classes are ignorant and unaware of anything besides food and clothing! The upper classes are incompetent and unable to defend, fearful and weak, immersed in writing, and do not engage in production! The habits of collapsing, decaying, indolent, and sluggishness, and the wind of following old ways and stealing ease, have filled the country and become serious disasters! If we want China to stand on its own in this world, then we must thoroughly transform the national life of China, so that it conforms to the meaning of the New Life, and in terms of its line, I believe there are three.</p>
<p>First, the militarization of national life. China, as a cultural nation, has always prided itself on civil affairs. Since the Tang Dynasty, the authorities of successive dynasties, fearing the disasters of separatist warlords, vigorously promoted the policy of promoting civil affairs and suppressing military affairs, and the spirit of strength and vigor was swept away! Civil affairs and military achievements are mutually supportive. Only when civil and military affairs are both prosperous can a nation be fit for survival. If there is only civil affairs and no military affairs, then it is a conquered slave! The Japanese ridiculed our China as "a country of letters!" They even said that Chinese literature is vast and profound, surpassing ancient and modern times, but those who excel in letters are not necessarily strong in force, so once they encounter nomadic tribes from outside the Great Wall, destruction follows. Their words are enough to be a warning. Not only that, but modern warfare is a three-dimensional war, and mobilization is the mobilization of the people. The development of modern weapons and military science is based on a high degree of scientific civilization. If China does not want to perish, then it must correct its historical weaknesses, strive to promote scientific civilization, popularize military knowledge, militarize national life, and make all aspects of clothing, food, housing, and transportation simple, plain, neat, and solemn. In particular, we should strive to popularize physical education and thoroughly militarize the youth. Even civil servants should often receive military training in their spare time, so that peacetime is like wartime, tense and solemn, knowing shame and teaching war, and washing away the historical habits of weakness and decadence of our nation!</p>
<p>Second, the productionization of national life. The economy is the foundation of the country. The rise and fall of a country's politics and the prosperity and decline of a nation all depend on it. In the past, Guan Zhong said: "Travel through the mountains and lakes, observe the mulberry and hemp, and calculate the production of the six domestic animals, and the wealth or poverty of the country can be known." He also said: "If there is more grassland and less cultivated land, even if there is no drought or flood, the country will be hungry. If this is the case and there are few people, it will not be enough to defend its land... If the people are not enough to defend, their cities will not be strong. If the people are hungry, they cannot be used to fight. If the industries are scattered and not defended, then the country will be in ruins!" Guan Zhong lived in an agricultural era, and the relationship between the economy and the national destiny was already like this, let alone today! To talk about developing the economy, production is paramount. The state should do its best to plan construction, control water conservancy, open up transportation, reclaim wasteland, and provide sufficient food for the people; use economic policies to guide industry and commerce, and adjust finance. For the people, every aspect of daily life should be in harmony with the meaning of production, that is, promote cherishing time, pay attention to work efficiency, regard diligence as a social virtue, and regard idleness and sitting idle without working as a deep shame. On the one hand, we should encourage frugality, so that the amount of social consumption does not exceed the amount of social production. In particular, we should promote the national concept of consumption, so that everyone knows that the gathering of buying and consumption, from a thread to a penny to an object, is all related to the rise and fall of national power and the prosperity and decline of the nation. Let compatriots across the country wear Chinese clothes, eat Chinese food, live in Chinese houses, and travel in China. If all the necessities of life can be obtained from domestic products, then the excess of imports over exports can be eliminated and the economic difficulties of the country can be alleviated! If the New Life Movement can do its best to achieve this, then its benefits to the country will be extensive!</p>
<p>Third, the artisticization of national life. The method of the New Life Movement emphasizes persuasion and edification, and does not adopt a coercive command style. If we want to penetrate into the people and transform the people into customs, then promoting the artisticization of national life is essential. Art is what distinguishes civilization from barbarism, and music is what distinguishes order from chaos. Taking music as an example, noble and pure music is enough to cultivate temperament, promote national integrity, console sorrow and resentment, and promote ambition, so that social vitality is abundant and interest in life is doubled. Conversely, if one indulges in the sound of killing and attack and the decadent sound, then it will only lead the people to the realm of licentiousness, and the harm it causes is immeasurable. How well said by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek: "If we start our revolutionary tutelage by promoting music, I think the results will be even more rapid. For example, if a place can set up a school that mainly promotes music, the general public will flock to it, and the effect of transforming the people into customs will definitely be even greater!" If we can take the artisticization of national life as a path, then the New Life Movement will be welcomed by the entire nation, and the magnitude of the results will be obvious. In short, one era has the mission of one era, and one era has the model of one era. China is at the meeting of old and new changes. The old ones have disappeared, and the new ones have not yet been established. The New Life Movement is enough to be the model of this era. The aforementioned lines seem necessary. My humble opinion is like this. I hope that the wise men in the country will correct me!</p>
<h3 id="e168">Shanghai City New Life Movement One Year Work Report <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Kaixian</p>
<p>I. The Initiation and Implementation of the New Life Movement</p>
<p>(I) The Initiation of the New Life Movement</p>
<p>The New Life Movement has now spread throughout the country. Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek established the outline, changed the Nanchang New Movement Association to the General Association, hired administrative officials from various provinces and cities to serve as instructors, and promulgated organizational outlines to unify the organization, the steps in various places have become more consistent, and promotion has become more convenient. The New Life Movement in this city was initiated around March of last year, and it was officially reorganized and established in July. The preparation process is described below.</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement in February of last year, it has swept across the country. Party, government, and military authorities in this city believed that this movement was critical to the rise and fall of the nation and should be promoted. After a joint meeting, it was decided to start preparations on March 20 at the remaining buildings of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Shanghai Office in Fenglinqiao. A declaration was issued, and initiatives were sought. A total of 315 people joined as initiators, and 300 people as supporters. The drafting of regulations and the compilation and printing of propaganda outlines took only twelve days, which was extremely tight.</p>
<p>(II) Summary of Work Progress</p>
<p>After the preparations were completed, an inaugural meeting was held on April 1. The charter and covenants of the association were approved, and important matters such as holding a propaganda week and experimental areas were resolved. 178 directors and supervisors were elected, and Mayor Wu Tiecheng was elected as the chairman of the board. The organization of the board of directors and supervisors is recorded on the left.</p>
<p>(A) Board of Directors: Composed of 79 directors and 41 alternate directors. At the joint meeting of directors and supervisors on April 5, the directors passed the organizational rules and elected 21 standing directors to form the standing committee. The number of meetings held was: the first on April 5 (immediately after the joint meeting), the second on April 16, and the third on July 24. The important motions of each meeting, in addition to the formulation of general rules for the organization of branches, are detailed in the meeting minutes. The board of directors is divided into the following four groups, each with two directors and deputy directors, and a number of staff members.</p>
<p>(1) General Affairs Group: Director Wu Kaixian, Deputy Director Jiang Huaishu. In addition to handling the daily routine of general affairs, its work also assists all groups in all matters.</p>
<p>(2) Organization Group: Director Wu Xingya, Deputy Director Lu Jingshi. Its work includes organizing branches in various agencies, groups, and schools in the urban area. Twenty-five have been approved for establishment, with more than 8,800 members. There are quite a few that have not been approved for establishment.</p>
<p>(3) Propaganda Group: Director Jun Xingbai, Deputy Director Zheng Zhengqiu. Its work included printing and distributing 50,000 slogans and leaflets, and printing 120,000 copies of booklets such as the Covenant Outline Movement. From April 9 to 15, a propaganda week was held for all sectors of society. Ten thousand people participated in the lantern parade on the 7th, which was a great success for a time. Japanese mail to and from this port was stamped with a special New Life Movement stamp as a memorial. During this week, the film industry publicly screened New Life slogans, and the broadcasting station broadcast the New Life Covenant, giving the citizens of the city a deep impression of the meaning of the New Life Movement.</p>
<p>(4) Guidance Group: Director Pan Gongzhan, Deputy Director Wen Hongen. Its work, in addition to guiding the establishment of various branches, also organized 500 persuasion teams from all walks of life, which were reviewed at the public stadium on June 4. They were neatly dressed and in high spirits. After the review, they immediately set off to persuade pedestrians on the streets.</p>
<p>(B) Board of Supervisors: Composed of 41 supervisors and 17 alternate supervisors. At the joint meeting of directors and supervisors on April 5, the supervisors passed the organizational rules and elected 11 standing supervisors to form the standing committee. The number of meetings held was: the first on April 11, the second on April 25, the third on May 9, the fourth on June 13, and the fifth on July 13. The important motions of each meeting are detailed in the meeting minutes. As for the meeting of the entire board of supervisors, the item was a discussion meeting on April 15. The first meeting of the board of supervisors was on May 9, and the second meeting of the board of supervisors was on July 13. The important motions of each meeting, in addition to the adoption of procedural rules, are also detailed in the meeting minutes. Only one secretary was appointed in the meeting, with Mo Xuanyuan, a standing supervisor, concurrently serving. The staff members were concurrently held by the staff members of the board of directors.</p>
<p>II. Unification and Progress of the New Life Movement</p>
<p>(I) Reorganization and Establishment of the New Life Movement Promotion Association</p>
<p>In early July, the Association received Notice No. 1 from the Nanchang General Association of Chiang Kai-shek, instructing it to reorganize in accordance with the organizational outline promulgated by the General Association. At the same time, Chairman Chiang hired Wu Tiecheng, the chairman of the board, as the instructor of this city, and instructed him to guide the reorganization of the Association. After discussion, it was decided to reorganize in accordance with the order, and all boards of directors and supervisors were terminated. In accordance with the new rules, nine executives were selected from various agencies and groups: Yu Hongjun from the Municipal Government, Wu Kaixian from the Municipal Party Department, Wu Xingya from the Social Affairs Bureau, Pan Gongzhan from the Education Bureau, Wen Hongen from the Public Security Bureau, Yang Hu from the military, Zhang Shouyong from the academic community, Lu Jingshi from the industrial community, and Yu Zuoting from the business community. They were immediately assigned duties and reported to the General Association for record. Looking back from the reorganization to the present, it has been almost July. The circumstances of the successive executive meetings in the past seven months are briefly described below:</p>
<p>The first executive meeting was held on July 30. There were four resolutions. The important ones were the division of labor: Wu Xingya, Yang Hu, and Pan Gongzhan were publicly elected as standing executives, Wu Kaixian as secretary, Lu Jingshi as director of the investigation section, Zhang Shouyong as director of the design section, and Wen Hongen as director of the promotion section.</p>
<p>The second executive meeting was held on August 16. There were three resolutions, the important one being the adoption of the revised charter.</p>
<p>The third executive meeting was held on October 24. There were four resolutions. The important ones were the adoption of measures to reform etiquette and customs, and the adoption of the first phase of the work plan.</p>
<p>The fourth executive meeting was held on December 28. Seven resolutions were discussed. The important ones were: Executive Wen Hongen passed away due to illness, and Director Wen Chaoji of the Bureau was appointed as an executive and director of the promotion section; and the organizational rules of the city's youth service corps were revised and the implementation of new life measures was urged.</p>
<p>The fifth executive meeting was held on February 9 of this year. There were seven resolutions. The important ones were: hiring branch leaders for the youth service corps and adding deputy branch leaders; Executive Wu Kaixian was reassigned as a concurrent standing member and was designated by the instructor as the chief executive, and Executive Pan Gongzhan was reassigned as a concurrent secretary; and a representative conference from all walks of life was held on February 19, the New Life Memorial Day.</p>
<p>(II) Implementation of the Work Plan</p>
<p>The above summary of the situation since the preparation, establishment, reorganization, and current progress can be seen in general. Others, such as the establishment of the Experimental Area Design Committee, and the election of committee members Yu Hongjun, Tao Baichuan, Ding Mocun, Yang Weiyu, and Tai Shuangqiu, were all generated during the previous joint meeting of directors and supervisors. The experimental site was planned to be in Jiangwan or Wusong, and it has been discussed and progressed through numerous meetings. However, due to tight funding, it has not been realized. The current planned progress is (1) urging and examining the implementation of new life by staff members of various agencies, (2) urging and examining the implementation of new life in various public places (such as restaurants and hotels), (3) compiling various cost-effective art slogans on carriages and thoroughfares, guiding the methods, and (4) rectifying the city appearance, etc., and regulations and measures have been drafted and implemented separately.</p>
<p>III. Main Tasks of the New Life Movement in the Future</p>
<p>(I) Propaganda: To hope that the public understands and recognizes the true meaning of the New Life Movement, it depends on extensive and in-depth propaganda. The propaganda work of the Association, in addition to the above-mentioned printing and distribution of slogans and booklets, and the holding of propaganda weeks and large lantern parades, still needs to be continued due to the vast area and dense population, so that everyone knows it. Therefore, the planned activities for this year are to establish permanent slogans. Choose key thoroughfares and make neon lights and large oil paint slogans with artistic methods and thought-provoking words to inspire deep thought. In addition, public vehicles and ships, which have a large number of passengers every day, have also been carefully considered.</p>
<p>(II) Supervision: The implementation of the New Life Movement cannot be neglected, and this supervision must be slightly compulsory when necessary to achieve results. The planned supervision work for this year is to start with various agencies and their staff. Monthly reflection forms and instructions on how to work from Chairman Chiang Kai-shek will be issued, and they will be asked to sign and recognize them, and they will be assessed at any time. The New Life Movement in public places must also be carried out at the same time. Regarding various regulations, they have all been drafted and can be distributed to various public places for implementation in accordance with the regulations. At the same time, the Public Security Bureau will conduct inspections and crackdowns at any time, which should be effective.</p>
<p>(III) Persuasion: The implementation of the New Life Movement in public places can be compulsory due to their business nature, but the implementation of the New Life Movement in households depends on persuasion in addition to supervision. Regarding this matter, the Association has also planned measures to organize youth service corps, adopting a branch system, and soliciting party members, students from various schools, boy scouts, etc. to serve as members in each area, taking turns to serve. On weekends and holidays, they will go to thoroughfares and streets to guide pedestrians and households to implement the New Life Movement on the spot. Those who unreasonably resist will be required to ask the police officers of the Public Security Bureau to take them to the scene to reprimand them.</p>
<p>It should also be mentioned that the environment of this city is different due to the relationship of the concession, and the promotion of the New Life Movement has not been as expected. Therefore, the established plan can only be guided by the situation and gradually progressed. It is hoped that wise men from all walks of life will always give guidance, and the business funds will be determined as soon as possible, so that the efforts to promote and realize the plan, and the future of the New Life Movement, will depend on it.</p>
<h3 id="e169">Promotion of the New Life Movement <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Pan Gongzhan</p>
<p>The New Life Movement has been initiated and advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek in Nanchang for a year now. In the past year, various places have responded successively, and there have been quite a few New Life Movement Promotion Associations established one after another. This city is a major port in the southeast, and the world's attention is focused on it. The promotion of the New Life Movement should not be delayed. However, looking back at the past achievements, the scope has not been expanded sufficiently, and the public has not universally practiced it. The decadent and dissolute life remains the same. Perhaps this is also because those who practice the New Life have failed to widely advise with their experience and spread it as a trend? The past time cannot be recovered, and the future movement must be redoubled. I believe that those who practice the New Life must pay attention to the following ways of promotion:</p>
<p>1. From shallow to deep: The promotion of the New Life Movement hopes that the behavior of the people across the country conforms to propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame, and is expressed in various daily lives such as clothing, food, housing, and transportation. However, the realization of the above goals is not achieved overnight. It should be from shallow to deep, first the simple and then the heavy, and it must not be interrupted, and progress step by step to achieve the artistic and rationalization of life, and adapt to the needs of the times and the environment.</p>
<p>2. From near to far: The New Life Movement is not a matter for one person, but a matter for the common efforts of the entire nation. Like a machine, if you want it to run quickly and increase its efficiency, any part cannot lose its function. Those who practice the New Life should take the sincerity of pushing oneself and others, from one person to one family, from family to neighborhood and village, from near to far, the scope will expand day by day, and the practitioners will gradually increase, so that the lives of the people across the country will be renewed, and everyone will be a healthy citizen.</p>
<p>3. Persistent: The achievement of any career is not determined by the enthusiasm of the moment, but by the perseverance to practice it persistently. Therefore, the word "persistence" is the mother of success. When the New Life Movement is advocated by everyone, it will inevitably be vigorous and diligent in practice. Once the time has passed, it often returns to its original appearance, and the various rules of the New Life are left behind. Therefore, practitioners must be persistent, first create good habits, and after a long time, they will settle in this kind of life and not feel it.</p>
<p>Now the national situation is critical, and it is the critical moment for the survival of the Chinese nation. The success or failure of the New Life Movement is what the national spirit strikes. Guanzi said that propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are the four dimensions of the country. If the four dimensions are not expanded, the country will perish. If most people do not know what propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame are, then they will inevitably not distinguish between right and wrong, not examine public and private affairs, not understand the root and the branch, and take interest inappropriately. Young people are dissolute and extravagant, and adults are昏庸corrupt. The rich are engaged in frivolity, and the poor fall into meanness. It is very difficult to hope that such an unorganized, undisciplined, and immoral people can survive in modern times. The New Life Movement, on the surface, is only to make personal life conform to the rules, and its ultimate goal is to relate to the survival of the nation. Therefore, the New Life Movement is a self-reliance movement of our nation, a life revolution of our nation, and a renaissance movement of the nation. Those of us who have the responsibility to promote the New Life Movement must understand this meaning together, and then we can make the greatest determination, jointly abide by it, and widely advise it, to save the now endangered nation.</p>
<h3 id="e170">Further New Life Movement <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Tao Baichuan</p>
<p>Written for the Anniversary of the New Life Movement</p>
<p>I. Further on the Anniversary</p>
<p>Since Chairman Chiang Kai-shek advocated the New Life Movement on February 19 last year, everyone has believed that this is the starting point of the Chinese people's life revolution and the basic work of reviving the Chinese nation. Therefore, the upper echelons influenced the lower echelons, and it was a fad for a while. Time flies, and now it is the anniversary.</p>
<p>The guiding principles of the New Life Movement are propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. To achieve these principles, the first priority is "rules" and "cleanliness." Rules and cleanliness are certainly good goals, but these two alone cannot achieve the purpose of propriety, righteousness, integrity, and shame. Therefore, we hope that Chairman Chiang can put forward slightly higher goals and make a "further New Life Movement."</p>
<p>Sure enough, Chairman Chiang has recently told us: "Rules and cleanliness are only the beginning of this movement, that is, the lowest target of this movement. After the anniversary, we plan to maintain and enrich the past achievements on the one hand, and promote further on the other hand, that is, the national people's 'life militarization,' 'life productionization,' and 'life artification' that we plan."</p>
<p>From rules and cleanliness to life militarization, productionization, and artification, this is a "further New Life Movement."</p>
<p>II. Life Militarization</p>
<p>Regarding life militarization, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said: "It is not intended to arm the people of the whole country at the same time and go to the border; in the initial stage, it is only to expect them to be strict in organization, value unity, abide by discipline, pay attention to order, be energetic, maintain solemnity, and wash away the previous habits of disorganization, romance, following the old ways, and苟安," and the main points are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Salute when raising and lowering the national flag.</p>
<p>2. Stand up when the party song is played.</p>
<p>3. Support the leader.</p>
<p>4. Obey the discipline.</p>
<p>5. Everyone must receive military training.</p>
<p>6. Everyone must receive civic training.</p>
<p>7. Implement air defense exercises.</p>
<p>8. Implement rescue exercises.</p>
<p>9. Walk on the left.</p>
<p>10. Keep your eyes level and your head up when walking.</p>
<p>11. Take less cars and walk more.</p>
<p>12. The utensils should be simple.</p>
<p>13. Get up early and go to bed early.</p>
<p>14. Exercise every day.</p>
<p>III. Life Productionization</p>
<p>Regarding life productionization, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said: "It is not intended to make all the people in the country be farmers, workers, or merchants. In the initial stage, it is only to expect them to be able to save, be diligent, care about the difficulty of material resources, and devote themselves to the path of production, and wash away the previous habits of extravagance, waste, enjoyment, and leisure." The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Labor.</p>
<p>2. Use domestic products.</p>
<p>3. Save expenses.</p>
<p>4. Reduce socializing.</p>
<p>5. Everyone joins the cooperative.</p>
<p>6. Reclaim wasteland and plant trees.</p>
<p>7. Work hard on family handicrafts.</p>
<p>8. No prostitution, no gambling, no smoking, no alcoholism.</p>
<p>9. Money must be saved.</p>
<p>10. Tea and snacks can be used for wedding and funeral banquets.</p>
<p>11. Find something to do when you have nothing to do.</p>
<p>12. Cherish time.</p>
<p>13. Use waste.</p>
<p>IV. Life Artification</p>
<p>Regarding life artification, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek said: "It is not intended to make all the people in the country be writers, elegant scholars, painters, sculptors, and musicians. In the initial stage, it is only to expect them to be polite, humble, clean, tidy, lively, and optimistic, and wash away the previous habits of rudeness, meanness, narrowness, and ignorance." The main points are as follows:</p>
<p>1. Eat cleanly.</p>
<p>2. Dress simply.</p>
<p>3. Keep the residence tidy.</p>
<p>4. Speak truthfully.</p>
<p>5. Act quickly.</p>
<p>6. Be energetic in doing things.</p>
<p>7. Be polite to others.</p>
<p>V. Significance of the Anniversary</p>
<p>The New Life Movement is already an anniversary! The New Life Movement Promotion Association has designated February 19 as the New Life Movement Memorial Day. We want to develop the spirit of "reviewing the past and encouraging the future." Let's thoroughly review our individual lives and actively strive! We also want to go a step further, from "cleanliness" and "rules" to "life militarization," "life productionization," and "life artification"!</p>

<h3 id="e176">Overview of Education in the Northeast under Japanese Cultural Aggression <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>The Puppet Capital Library Adds a Large Number of Anesthetic Books</p>
<p>The South Manchuria Railway Attached School Does Not Use Female Teachers</p>
<p>(Northeast News Agency) After the fall of the Northeast, the Japanese have become more and more aggressive in cultural aggression, and forced the Puppet Ministry of Education to accept their enslaving education policy and implement it in schools in the Northeast to anesthetize young students. To this day, the harm of anesthesia suffered by young people in the Northeast is really not superficial. The following are the details:</p>
<p>News from the Puppet Ministry of Education</p>
<p>(Changchun News) (1) The Director of the General Affairs Department of the Puppet Ministry of Education, the Japanese Nishiyama, had to resign due to various constraints caused by the infighting of Japanese academic cliques in the Northeast. The successor has been internally designated as the Japanese Kume Naruo, the Director of the General Affairs Department of the Puppet Fengtian Provincial Government. It is also heard that due to internal factional relations in the Japanese side, the Japanese Kamimura, the Director of the Academic Affairs Department of the Puppet Ministry of Education, will also resign. (2) The Japanese forced the Puppet Ministry of Education to conduct qualification examinations for middle school teachers in various provinces and regions to prevent anti-"Manchu" and anti-Japanese ideas in the education field. As for the qualification examinations for middle school principals, they will be conducted separately after the teacher qualification examinations. (2) In order to please Japan, the Puppet Ministry of Education specially funded a large number of students studying in Japan. The exam papers have been reviewed, and a total of 19 students studying in specialized schools in Japan, 62 students studying in higher specialized schools, and 11 students studying in middle schools have been admitted. There are a total of 92 students studying in Japan.</p>
<p>Puppet New East Library</p>
<p>(Changchun News) The Puppet New Capital Library has added a large number of books on friendship between Japan and "Manchukuo" and other anesthetic books since January 1 this year. According to statistics at the end of January, the library has a total of 28,492 books of various kinds. The number of people participating in reading under its anesthesia was 12,793 in the library and 1,507 outside the library, totaling 14,300 people. Compared with December last year, it increased by 417 people. Books such as operas, novels, literature, language, Manchu-Mongolian legal politics and economy, and social statistics increased by 1,029 copies. The content of these books is mostly materials such as the loyalty to the emperor and patriotism unilaterally promoted by the Japanese puppets.</p>
<p>Educational News from Various Places</p>
<p>(1) (Shenyang News) The schools affiliated to the South Manchuria Railway Co., Ltd. have completed the selection of about 50 teachers for middle schools and about 100 teachers for primary schools. Regarding female teachers, in the future, except for special responsibilities due to necessity, women will absolutely not be employed as teachers as far as possible. The absurd reason is that the absenteeism rate and resignation rate of female teachers are too high, especially the decision not to employ returnees. This can be said to be a 残女子职业据残女子职业忽视女子本能忽??, and ignoring women's instincts. (2) (Haicheng News) The Puppet County Governor of Haicheng County said that most of the office staff in the office did not know Japanese. In order to facilitate the contact with so-called Japanese friendly people and the translation of official documents, he set up a Japanese night school in the Puppet County Office for the sake of pro-Japanese people. The teachers were the Japanese Councilor A大道, and the pro-Japanese elements Liu Jidang, Kang Naicheng, and Wang Shoushan, the heads of each section. Classes were held every day from 6:00 pm to 7:30 pm. At present, all the staff in the office attend classes to learn Japanese. (3) (Jilin News) The Puppet Education Department of Jilin Province is scheduled to test the teachers of all middle schools in the province under its jurisdiction in the Puppet Department on February 25 to check whether there are any anti-"Manchu" and anti-Japanese ideas. Each person will be tested in two courses. As for the travel expenses, they will be borne by the Puppet Education Department. (4) (Harbin News) On the south side of the Second Malu in Daowai, Harbin, next to the Catholic Church, Japanese ronin have set up a Japanese language academy there, and advertised it widely to swindle money. In general, those who want to be pro-Japanese but do not know Japanese and Japanese have flocked to sign up, paying a registration fee of two yuan per person. It is found that the content of the Japanese language academy is extremely simple. The Puppet Education Bureau of the area knows that the Japanese ronin are assuming an agency to swindle money, but they are afraid of the labor of the Japanese and dare not ban it.</p>

<p>Personnel Have Been Assigned to Contact the Railway Bureau to Arrange for Transportation</p>
<p>A Small Number of Staff Will Remain in Shanghai to Purchase Books</p>
<p>The new building of the Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center in this city, which was built next to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in Nanjing last year, has been completely completed. The center is scheduled to move to Nanjing starting tomorrow and will open in Nanjing on the 26th. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>The New Building Is Grand The Sun Yat-sen Cultural and Educational Center on Foch Road in this city, in view of the development of its business and the expiration of the lease on the original site, raised funds last year by the director of the center, Mr. Sun Zhesheng, and others, to build a general center next to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum in the capital. It has now been completely completed. The three-story building is quite solemn and grand. The center is scheduled to begin moving tomorrow. The city originally intended to set up a distribution office, but this intention has now been abandoned. It has been decided to set up a distribution office in Nanjing instead.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Pan Gongzhan's Speech on School Education in Shanghai (1) <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The fifth lecture in the "Shanghai" system of speeches at the Shanghai YMCA by Pan Gongzhan, Director of the Shanghai Education Bureau, recorded by Xie Chongshan as follows:</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>Chairman, distinguished guests, today the Shanghai YMCA has invited me to speak on the issue of "Education in Shanghai." From my position, currently serving in the administrative affairs of education, I cannot decline this topic due to my responsibilities. However, I do not have the ability to completely explain "Education in Shanghai," and it would be impossible to report everything in detail with statistical figures in such a short period of time. Moreover, I am afraid that everyone would find it troublesome to listen. To be honest, the current educational statistics are not very reliable due to various environmental factors. However, although these statistics may not be completely reliable, they can be used as a rough reference. Therefore, I would like to first make a simple report on the statistics of school education in Shanghai, categorized. After the report, we will discuss these statistics together to see which areas should be emphasized in the future improvement of education in Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Government publishes a statistical book every year, publishing statistical figures for various undertakings such as "Education," "Hygiene," and "Public Security" in Shanghai. However, this is published according to the fiscal year. For example, the statistics for the 22nd year of the Republic of China are from July of the 21st year of the Republic of China to June of the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and the statistics for the 23rd year are from July of the 23rd year to June of the 24th year. Therefore, the statistics I am reporting now are the statistics for the 22nd year of the Republic of China (ending June of the 23rd year). These statistics are currently being printed and will be published soon. However, they are still relatively recent statistics. According to this, the total population of Shanghai is more than 3.4 million, including the scope of the Municipal Government and the Public and French Concessions. How many schools are there in this city with more than 3.4 million people? We will not distinguish between public and private now, but only say the total number of elementary schools, middle schools, and universities. (1) There are 849 elementary schools (including kindergartens, short-term elementary schools, junior elementary schools, and senior elementary schools). There are 137 secondary schools (including junior middle schools, senior middle schools, normal schools, and vocational schools). There are 33 higher schools (including vocational schools, independent colleges, and universities). The total number of schools in these three levels of primary, secondary, and higher education is 1,019. (2) Among the schools in the three levels of primary, secondary, and higher education, the number of students is the largest in elementary schools, followed by secondary schools, and then higher schools. There are 158,164 elementary school students, 32,648 secondary school students, and 12,141 higher school students. The total number of students combined is 202,953. (3) In addition to students, we should also pay attention to teachers and staff. There are 6,459 teachers and staff in elementary schools, 3,782 teachers and staff in secondary schools, and 2,363 teachers and staff in higher schools. The total number is 12,604. (4) As for the annual expenses of schools at each level, elementary schools spend 4,111,073 yuan, secondary schools spend 3,926,748 yuan, and higher schools spend 6,436,242 yuan. The total expenditure of all schools is 14,474,063 yuan.</p>
<p>After briefly mentioning the various statistical figures for the 22nd year, we can compare them with the previous year. It can be said that the total figures for each category in the 22nd year have made considerable progress compared to the 21st year. (1) The total number of schools was 967 in the 21st year and 1,019 in the 22nd year, an increase of 52 schools. Among them, the number of elementary schools was 792 in the 21st year and 849 in the 22nd year, an increase of 57 schools, all of which were elementary schools. As for middle schools and universities, there was only a decrease compared to the previous year, with no increase. For example, there were 141 secondary schools in the 21st year and only 137 in the 22nd year, a decrease of 4 schools. There were 34 higher schools in the 21st year, but only 33 in the 22nd year, a decrease of 1 school. (2) Looking at the total number of students, there were 185,661 in the 21st year and 202,953 in the 22nd year, an increase of nearly 20,000 people. Which students increased? Comparing the number of secondary school students with the previous year, there were 29,122 secondary school students in the 21st year and 32,648 in the 22nd year, an increase of more than 3,000 students. What about the number of higher school students? In the 21st year, there were 13,227 higher school students, but only 12,141 in the 22nd year, a decrease of more than 1,000 students. As for the number of elementary school students, there were 143,312 elementary school students in the 21st year and 158,164 in the 22nd year, an increase of almost 15,000 people. Therefore, the increase in students this year was the largest in elementary schools. (3) The expenses of schools at each level are also the same, with more increases in elementary education. The expenses of secondary schools in the 21st year were 3,915,479 yuan, and the expenses in the 22nd year increased to 3,926,748 yuan. The expenses of higher schools in the 21st year were 5,628,596 yuan, and the expenses in the 22nd year increased to 6,436,242 yuan. The expenses of elementary schools in the 21st year were 3,325,421 yuan, and the expenses in the 22nd year increased to 4,111,073 yuan, an increase of almost 800,000 yuan compared with the previous year, while the expenses of middle schools and universities only increased slightly, and the numbers were very small. Therefore, from this simple statistical report, we can get some comparative comfort, that is, from the general situation, although the country is in serious trouble, the social economy is declining, and everyone's livelihood is difficult, under such circumstances, the school education in Shanghai, as a whole, has made considerable progress in the 22nd year compared to the 21st year. Especially gratifying is that the largest part of this progress is in elementary education. The number of elementary schools has increased, the number of students has increased, and the amount of funding has also increased, and the increase is very large. For example, the number of elementary school students has increased to 15,000, and the funding has increased to 800,000 yuan. Compared with the number of students and the amount of funding in secondary and higher education, they have only increased a little, and the numbers are very small. This is a relatively comforting thing.</p>
<p>Why do I only say it is relatively comforting? I personally want to make this clear. This is also a view I have on education in China in the current era, and I cannot help but express it. If my view is correct, then the facts in this report are gratifying. If you think my view is incorrect, then today's report is not a relatively gratifying thing, but even a terrible or painful one. This depends on each person's view on education and their understanding of education, and then decides which point in the current educational view they should pay attention to. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e200">Gold Market: Financial Ups and Downs <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>Morning Session: Low Price of $907.50</p>
<p>Exchange Rate Tightens: Returns to $20 Level</p>
<p>Rising Trend Not Strong: Many Residuals Seemingly Cleared</p>
<p>The gold market experienced ups and downs yesterday, making it extremely difficult to predict. Initially, due to the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhibu's aggressive selling of shillings, the price dropped to a low of $907.50. Central and other banks aggressively made purchases to balance this, and the exchange rate tightened, causing a sharp rebound. However, the final trend lacked momentum. At the beginning of the morning, the overseas silver market saw the British pound rise and the US dollar remain stable. The exchange rate slightly contracted. The London gold price did not move. According to reports, the Financial Advisory Committee approved the incentive import measures proposed by various commercial organizations. Outside the market, preliminary trading opened lower, falling back to sixteen or seventeen yuan, then rising to eighteen or nineteen yuan. However, many parties still felt panicked, and large investors sold off in succession. The morning opening was therefore low. The exchange rate hardened, and the downward trend continued after the opening. Despite some fluctuations, the banks lacked buying interest, the Chinese merchants' psychology was depressed, and the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhibu aggressively sold shillings. Western merchants also cut losses. The selling pressure within the market exceeded demand, breaking the ten-yuan barrier again and reaching a new low price of $907.50. Buyers took advantage of the low prices, resulting in some rebound. At this time, people were in a state of confusion, and supply and demand were extremely chaotic, causing prices to fluctuate significantly. Upon learning that the HSBC's exchange rate announcement showed the British pound and US dollar continuing to rise, prices hovered around the ten-yuan level. Later, the central bank took advantage of the low prices to buy shillings, and buyers rallied, causing prices to rise. Rumors spread that the central bank was opening for cash exchange, resulting in a significant rebound. However, because the selling pressure had not yet subsided, there was still ample supply at high prices. The silver balance tax announcement came out unexpectedly. There was still a setback. Later, with HSBC, East Asia, the Central Bank, and others still making purchases, prices rose again. Although there was a rebound after entering the market, it was because the exchange rate had tightened, and people's hearts were slightly encouraged, and large investors chased to buy in the afternoon. In the end, the price rebounded to above the $20 level. The market opened lower in the afternoon session due to the residual momentum after the morning close. Although there was some downward movement after the opening, the banks had a strong buying appetite, the exchange rate continued to tighten, and the Dalian gang bought paper, causing the buying pressure to increase again and rebound. However, because large investors still had ample selling intentions, there were many fluctuations after the rise. This was because the Indian silver report was small by five annas. However, the overall trend was weak, lacking the strength to rise. Although the Indian silver shrank by one anna after entering the market, it closed weakly because supply exceeded demand. The market conditions for the day were initially weak but then firm. Many residuals seemed to have been cleared, but the rising trend was still not strong. The market conditions for the day are recorded below:</p>

The Central Bank's listing announcement showed the British pound flat and the US dollar shrinking by 0.0625. The customs gold unit did not move, with no significant impact. However, because the psychology of Chinese merchants was still difficult to boost, tending to sell off, and banks were sluggish in accepting, coupled with the Jewish merchant Qiao Zhibu and others aggressively selling shillings, the internal market quickly became loose. HSBC's listing announcement showed the British pound rising 1.25 and the US dollar rising 1.875, also lacking much stimulation. However, the situation was instead in a trance. Later, the Central Bank took advantage of the cheap prices to support, stabilizing the situation. The silver balance tax did not move. At this time, the situation was still uncertain.

<p>Outwardly Peaceful, Inwardly Still There is Infighting</p>
<p>Recently, banks along the Bund, in view of the drastic changes that occurred in money houses at the end of last year, have been very cautious in accepting bills. Even normal dealings are considered very carefully, so it seems that there are still acts of infighting. However, outwardly, the ocean loan is flat and loose, which is seen as stable by various industries. But in reality, each family must engage in strength, so the self-defense is very meticulous. In the money industry market, loan notes are correspondingly scarce. The ocean loan still opens at nine cents, and adding water on top is approximately between one and two cents. The loan market transaction, in the early market, the turnover was more than 1.9 million, and the new transaction was 600,000. Bank receipts and settlements: Foreign banks received and settled bill funds of more than 2.2 million, various goods and foreign exchange mortgages and miscellaneous funds of more than 500,000, and warehousing of 300,000.

<h3 id="e203">Securities, the 23rd Issue, Short Sellers Struggle <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Market Recovered to Full-Day Trading</p>
<p>Tight Silver Makes Trading Difficult</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange has resumed full-day four-session trading. The market showed a slightly dazed and uncertain appearance, slightly rebounding and then rising, slightly rising and then rebounding, mostly due to the relationship between long and short swap. Because the delivery of the February futures has been set for the 26th, and the February futures trading will be done until the 22nd, the period has been urged, so there is this high and low uncertain state. However, because silver capital in recent days is still very tight, yesterday was the time for various money houses to send folds to their usual customers, but in fact, those sending folds were as sparse as morning stars. Even if there were those who sent them as usual, they also reduced their scope and added restrictions. Public debt, affected by this silver capital, was unable to raise its head for a while. The manipulation situation of the 23rd issue alone in the market continued to develop abnormally. The long parties knew that there was no way to get rid of it, and they only went forward in one direction, while the short parties, under various pressures, were not willing to give in, and were willing to eat extra swaps. Because the market price has reached 95%, and the peak is not far away, the long party cannot get out, otherwise it is still difficult to avoid being calculated by the short party. Therefore, the current large long and short parties are in a difficult situation, and there will inevitably be strange infighting in the future. Yesterday's passage, the opening in the morning was mostly loose, and the 15th, 21st, and 43rd issues, etc., were quite sold, and the market price mostly rebounded by one or two cents to four cents. The 23rd issue was still running in the opposite direction, and the 4th and 17th issues, etc., had quite an appetite, raising the one-yuan spectrum, and the situation was extremely good. In the second session, the valley debt market slightly rebounded by two or three cents, and the 23rd issue was more peaceful, continuing to rise by two or three cents. The afternoon opening, each debt market all rose again by five points, one angle to three angles, and the 23rd issue was half a yuan better. The closing was slightly chaotic, with highs and lows interspersed, and the 23rd issue in the current month raised another nine angles, and the long-term period still went down five points. The short head suffered to swap periods. The highest price of the 23rd issue has reached a new high price of 82 yuan. The rising wind does not converge slightly because the market price is already high. There are still many dangers ahead. Yesterday's passage, each debt market mostly saw high and low interspersed, numbering five points, one angle to two or three angles, the 23rd issue in this month frantically rose by two yuan, six angles and a half, and the long-term period also rose by one yuan and two angles. The total number of transactions, counted together, was 19,599,000 yuan. Now the rise and fall results are listed in the comparison table on the left. (Unit Yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>
<h3 id="e204">Yarn Flower Label Yarn Shows a Slight Rebound <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>After the cotton yarn market has fallen sharply for several days, it is showing a slight stabilization. In addition, there are rumors in the market that a certain banking giant has promised to release mortgage loans for cotton yarn, and that there is a desire to maintain the yarn industry, etc. Therefore, people's hearts have turned strong, and new sales have been temporarily curbed. At the same time, spot yarn transactions have increased compared to before, but the environment is not very good.</p>
<p>Golden Rooster Rebounded Five, Six or Seven Angles</p>
<p>The pre-market opening of the labeled yarn market, due to the unremitting false wind of the previous day, the situation was still weak, and in the last three months, it fell another four or five angles, but when filming to the far month, short heads gathered to supplement, the market was tight, and rose four or five angles. When filming to the second or third session, there were many rumors on the market, all favorable to buyers. There are more than 1,000 bales of expiring goods this month. Wu might not deliver them, and the buying momentum suddenly became strong. As a result, each month rose two, six, seven or eight angles. The afternoon opening market saw a slight hardening image. According to the market, the exchange has a way to deal with the yarn this month, and the market price rose, but when filmed to the second or third session, the long-term head of a certain company continued to cut and close, and the stage surface turned loose and abusive again. As a result, each month fell again by one or two angles. Check that Shenchang sold 5,750 packages, Runkang 4,300 packages, Mei Ji 650 packages, and Tonghe 600 packages. All bought 750 packages, communication 950 packages, Jinchang 1,150 packages, Tongxing 700 packages, Yuanyi 2,150 packages, Taichang 1,450 packages, Dachang 600 packages, and Shengyuan 600 packages. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<h3 id="e205">Cotton Market Momentum Less Than Yarn Firmness <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>The cotton market shows signs of fatigue. American cotton is weak, exchange rates are rising, and the calculated price of imported cotton is getting closer to the cost. Factories are finding business difficult due to cheap yarn and expensive cotton, and need to reduce production. According to sources in the cotton industry, there is a large amount of cotton stored in various producing areas, which has not yet been shipped out, and is waiting to be sold at a good price. It is said that there is still hope for increased arrivals in the future.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Unable to Rally</p>
<p>At the opening of the cotton auction, American cotton fell slightly by one to two points per pound, while Indian cotton rose by 0.075 to 1.5 rupees. Generally, profits were taken and short positions were covered. Gold prices rose slightly, with all months rising by 0.05 to 0.1 yuan. The market momentum in the second session remained high, but intelligence indicated that the market suddenly turned weak at the close due to continued liquidation by a certain company's long positions. As a result, all months rose by 0.05 yuan. The market was tight at the opening in the afternoon, with the first two or three auctions seeing high activity. Because there were more than 8,000 dan of deliveries for this month, the recipients were less affected by the tight money supply. Shanghai had sufficient cotton in storage, so the cotton market was softer than the yarn market. As a result, the current month fell by 0.15 yuan and the distant months fell by 0.05 yuan. The following were the major sales: Jifeng 1,600 dan, Meiji 2,700 dan, Tongji 1,400 dan, Shenchang 5,300 dan, Run Kang 2,900 dan, Tonghe 3,800 dan, Yikang 4,500 dan, Tongxing 1,400 dan, Changhe 2,900 dan. The major purchases were Dafu 5,200 dan, Dafeng 3,000 dan, Tongxing 1,800 dan, Yuanyi 3,800 dan, Yuanxingchang 2,400 dan, Changhe 3,900 dan, and Run Kang 2,800 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>The number of yarn accounts in the Huashang Yarn and Cloth Exchange up to February 16 was examined. 17,750 bales were traded for February, 47,900 bales for March, 52,550 bales for April, 36,900 bales for May, 23,800 bales for June, and 17,900 bales for July, for a total of 196,800 bales. This is an increase of 23,450 bales compared to the 173,350 bales at the end of last year. The recent sharp decline in the yarn market has been entirely influenced by the financial squeeze. A certain large company that was actively optimistic about rising prices last year is now threatened by the adverse environment and has liquidated most of its long positions. Therefore, the market has fallen drastically. However, a certain yarn factory in the interior has made a large profit by covering its positions, but Japanese short positions have not yet been covered. The largest amounts of buying and selling are listed below (unit: bales):</p>
<p>Indian-British Cotton Industry Weekly Report</p>
<p>(Bombay) Market conditions were slightly softer last week. Although there were inquiries from Japan, there was still a lack of demand from the industry. White Luo Creek cotton was moving well, but one-fourth of the production had already been purchased by Indian factories. There was no activity from China, and little interest from Europe. Exports of textiles were very low, so factory demand was gradually decreasing. The statistics for last week are attached below (unit: thousands of bales):</p>
<p>(Liverpool) The spot market was quiet last week. Futures gradually saw light at the end of the week due to good news from Bombay and New Orleans. However, the industry was still cautious due to the uncertainty of the American gold bar case. Market prices were quite firm due to the lack of sellers and the absorption of all sales by the industry. The Egyptian cotton market was sluggish, but prices were already close to their low point. If news favorable to buyers emerges after the gold bar case is decided, it is likely to respond quickly.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Grain and Foreign Rice Market Activity Not Weak <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's foreign rice market saw limited activity in the morning due to the Lantern Festival and the closure of the Hexia rice market for one day. There were few inquiries from local customers about foreign rice, so there were few transactions. However, in the afternoon, the local market inquired about Hexia rice due to its closure, and there were inquiries from Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, and Zhejiang. There was also activity from Fuzhou and the Yangtze River area. Market activity picked up again. As a result, foreign rice is expected to continue to rise due to low inventory and high production prices, making future shipments unprofitable. Saigon No. 1 rice is stable due to sufficient inventory, while No. 3 rice and Siamese rice continue to rise by 0.03 to 0.05 yuan, with strong future demand. There is still hope for further increases in the market.</p>

A total of 58,000 pieces of spot and forward soybean cake were sold from various factories. Prices fell by 0.02 yuan, but the trend has already turned tight. With strong soybean cake sales, the soybean market also tended to stabilize. However, Hankou soybeans remained sluggish due to market conditions. Yesterday's soybean market saw two truckloads of Bengbu soybeans sold at 3.80 and 3.75 yuan per dan, one truckload of Yingzhou soybeans sold at 3.81 yuan per dan, 1,400-1,500 bags of Guide soybeans sold at 3.83 and 3.80 yuan per dan, and 1,000 bags of Dangshan soybeans sold at 3.775 yuan per dan.

Sales were to the interior and the local market. Prices were 0.06 to 0.07 yuan lower than last Saturday.</p>
<p>American Merchants Purchase May Wheat</p>
<p>The local Flour and Wheat Exchange was closed due to the Lantern Festival. Chicago wheat merchants continued to purchase May contracts. The number of supplies decrease can be seen next Monday, approximately 2.5 million bushels. Some experts believe that this number is already high enough.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Sugar Market Not Very Lively <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's sugar market softened with the Kuan Jin exchange rate. 1,100 bags of #24 raw white sugar were auctioned by the cooperative company at a price of only 17.5 yuan, another 0.1 yuan lower than before. Re-exported #5 sugar was priced at 5 yuan, and re-exported #8/9 Dutch red sugar was priced at 4.53 yuan. Transactions were all sporadic. Over 400 bags of Chaoqing sugar continued to be offered at prices of 10.0, 9.8, and 9.6 yuan. Over 200 bags of Zhiyang sugar were offered at prices of 23.0 and 22.2 yuan. Quanzhou red sugar was not sold due to unsuitable prices. Over 100 boxes of Wufu white crystal sugar continued to arrive but remained sluggish, with fears of a price decline.</p>
<h3 id="e209">Oil Market Hankou Jingbai Wood Oil First Offer <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>The tung oil sales market in this port has been quite active since the spring market opened. However, all firms are simply borrowing goods to fill orders. Cost calculations must wait for the first offer from the Hankou market. Since the final account settlement, borrowed goods have been benchmarked to 13 taels of Chongjing wood oil. Therefore, sale prices have ranged from 22 to 23 yuan per picul. Unexpectedly, a telegram arrived last night from Hankou stating that the first offer for Chongjing wood oil was 14 taels plain. Based on this calculation, the price should be around 24 yuan. Therefore, the cost of borrowed goods for all firms must result in losses. Overall, it is estimated that there is a loss of one yuan per piece. Therefore, today all firms convened a public price discussion and increased the price of non-wooden Chongjing wood oil to 24 yuan. However, the inventory of each firm is not abundant. Although the asking price in Hankou is high, they have no choice but to continue purchasing from them. It is feared that the future market cannot be expected to be small. Over 100 pieces of Jiangxi passenger oil have been offered at a price of 22 yuan per passenger standard. Future deliveries must be priced higher. It is heard that yesterday a guest in Jiaxing, Zhejiang Province, offered over 100 local carts for sale in Shanghai at 25.5 yuan per dan delivered to Shanghai.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Hardware Tinplate Trending Upward <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>Recent tinplate trading has been very active. However, the severe tightness of credit is causing most market transactions to be cash-based. Transactions are mostly small and fragmented, leading to prices steadily rising by 0.25 to 1 yuan per box. For example, 90-pound single-coated American goods are estimated at 16.5 yuan, British goods at 15.5 yuan, German goods at 15.6 yuan, double-coated British goods at 31.5 yuan, American goods at 32.75 yuan, and German goods at 31.5 yuan, Italian goods at 31.25 yuan. 100-pound single-coated British goods are 16.5 yuan, American goods are 17.5 yuan, double-coated American goods are 35 yuan, British goods are 33 yuan, and German and Italian goods are 32.75 yuan. However, overseas prices have been soaring in recent days, so the local market momentum is exceptionally good. The future market is expected to continue to improve.</p>
<p>Pure Antimony New Stock Arrives</p>
<p>After the price increase of pure antimony, shipments have been frequently lacking. Large transactions have resulted in a shortage of goods to purchase. However, new stock arrived from China Merchants Group Jinliyuan Zhan and Taikoo Zhan in the past two days, alleviating concerns about market disruptions. The current market price is estimated at 800 yuan per ton, slightly lower than before by about 20 yuan. It is heard that over ten tons have been offered, purchased by foreign merchants. Local printing houses and type foundries are only making small transactions.</p>
<p>Blue Lead Sales Gradually Increase</p>
<p>Sales of blue lead have been increasing recently, so market transactions have been more numerous than before. Although tea merchants have not seen much activity, transactions from tin foil factories, paint factories, yellow lead factories, and type foundries have been booming. Therefore, the market has offered a substantial 1,000+ dan. The initial price was 14.6 yuan, which has now firmed to 14.7 yuan. There is not much stock currently circulating in the market, and sentiment is firmer than before. The market is likely to continue to improve.</p>
<p>Garden Lead Wire Drops Another 0.15 Yuan</p>
<p>Garden lead wire prices have fallen another 0.15 yuan due to frequent shipments of goods from Japan, resulting in a very large amount of stock circulating in the market, while buyers remain very quiet. Holders of goods are quite panicked. Prices are estimated at 3.6 yuan. It is heard that large transactions may see further declines.</p>

<p>Ping Shui green tea from Shaoxing and Ningbo in Zhejiang Province has traditionally relied heavily on sales to the United States. In recent years, due to competition from Japanese tea, sales have been declining. By last year, trade in Ping Shui colorless tea to the United States fell sharply by 40%. Exports of pearl tea to France were also sharply reduced compared to previous years. Therefore, Ping Shui tea merchants who operated last year suffered losses in the thousands and tens of thousands. After the final account settlement, tea firms in that area have been lifeless. Ping Shui tea warehouses, such as Yuansheng and Xielong, which hold the financial reins, are reportedly planning to prepare for liquidation. Others are mostly waiting and watching.</p>

<p>Single-sided waterproof raincoat cloth has seen a large number of sales in the past two days. Taihe, Rongkang, and Renshe #4026 regular goods are all selling for 5.15 yuan, and Hengli brand goods are selling for 4.95 yuan. Yuanchang colors are selling even more actively. Hengyuan, Yikang, Huakang, Changji, Chengda, and Xinchang are continuing to ship large quantities of goods, and the trend is quite good. However, silver-colored elephant skin-covered thin goods, although very cheap at 3 yuan, are difficult to sell. Except for making copper coin bags, they are already being phased out. Double-sided Japanese gauze raincoat cloth is also very active and selling well, selling for 1.15 yuan per yard net.</p>

<h3 id="e213">Literary Agent <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Yuan</p>
<p>This is an old tune; in a capitalist society, there is a danger of everything becoming commodified, and thus even literature and art are not spared.</p>
<p>The pinnacle of capitalism is the "Golden Circle Kingdom" of North America. There, the commodification of literature and art is, needless to say, a fact. Of course, this is not to say that everything that belongs to art in the "Golden Circle Kingdom" must be commodified, but rather that there is a great deal of commodified literature and art. For example, war-promoting works that promote sales for arms dealers (or, it doesn't matter if you say American imperialism) are "commodities" that are extremely popular for a time and ostensibly serve the "nation, society," and even "humanity." At worst, there are literary and artistic works for the "leisure" of idle old men, women, young masters, and young ladies. Although they can only be regarded as "luxury goods," they also have a large market.</p>
<p>However, there are also "literary agents" in the literary and art market of the "Golden Circle Kingdom." Speaking of which, the so-called "agent" is honestly a "broker," but the American "literary agent" apparently also has the identity of the "fang guan" in the Chinese imperial examination era. If the "agent" recommends a submission to various magazines and bookstores, there is hope of being used. A "agent" with a good brand has great credibility with any editor. When editors want to find a certain kind of work, they also ask the "agent" to find a way. A "agent" who is doing good business will receive 150 to 160 novels in a week—all waiting to be recommended.</p>
<p>In this way, the works of most unknown American writers first go through the recommendation of an "agent," and then through the selection of the editor, before they can meet the reader.</p>
<p>China is still a backward capitalist country, so although there is commodified "literature," and also commodified "literati," and even more "commercial" "literati," there does not seem to be a formal "literary agent."</p>
<p>However, this is limited to contemporary people and contemporary works. Ancient people and ancient works cannot be used as examples. It seems that China is, after all, an ancient country with 5,000 years of culture. There are as many authors as hair, and as many works as the ocean — just as the editorial department of the "Golden Circle Kingdom" receives an average of 300 manuscripts every day, so there must be "agents." On this point, without Dr. Hu Shih's recommendation, how could "Xingshi Yinyuan" become a "household name?" If it were not for the recommendation of Mr. Lin, how could "Yuan Zhonglang" and others be on the "20% discount" roadside book stalls? Our ancient writers cannot but thank the "agents" of later generations!</p>
<p>However, just as the "agents" of the "Golden Circle Kingdom" "admit that a promising new writer is simply equal to a year of good harvest," we here only discover one or one-and-a-half "promising" ancient literary giants a year. Last year it was Yuan Zhonglang, I wonder who it will be this year?</p>
<h3 id="e214">A Letter from the End of North Sichuan Road <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Xiang Yu</p>
<p>Brother Yuanwei!</p>
<p>I haven't had much to report to you for a few months. You have written me letter after letter, so if I don't reply to your letter, it seems a bit unreasonable, so I wrote this letter. In this, you can see that I am fulfilling an obligation, not reporting news. Even if there is some news, it is unimportant. At the same time, what I report may be what you don't want to know, and what you want to know is what I don't want to report. Don't take it as if I'm deliberately arguing with you, I'm just such a strange-tempered person. The more people want me to investigate a certain event on my personal side, the less I want to mention it, and the more people don't want to hear a certain event on my personal side, the more I want to talk about it, so I often answer irrelevant questions. You can already anticipate this result, and I don't need to declare it. Fortunately, I have already said that this is to fulfill an obligation. You can't expect too much from a letter to fulfill an obligation. Naturally, I am again singing a song by Tao Xing, reporting some old clichés. You have already heard these clichés so much that you feel a little annoyed, but what can be done? I'm just that kind of person! Listen carefully, I'm starting to report.</p>
<p>I'm not sick enough to die, as you suspect. You, who care about my health, may be happy to a certain extent about this. However, although I am not dead, I am in a state of neither life nor death, just like you and me together. People have already gotten up in the morning, but I am still lying straight in bed, and people haven't gone to bed at night, but I am already lying straight in bed. I sleep more hours than others, but I sleep less time than others. On moonlit nights, I watch the moon rise to the center, watch the moon set, and watch the sun rise. On windy nights, I listen to the howling of the wind, the tragic cries of stray dogs in the empty alley, the sound of the wonton hawker in the distance, the sound of cars returning from the dance hall by people who have leisure in the middle of the night, and the sound of the factory whistle of the nearby factory at dawn. I open my eyes and watch the night end and the day begin. After the day begins, sometimes I can sleep vaguely for a while, but at most two o'clock or so, a short time, and I wake up with a jolt, as if I have been greatly frightened. From then on, even chanting mantras can no longer put me to sleep. When I get up, every cell in my body seems to be filled with fatigue. When I lie down, I can't close my eyes. "What to do? What to do?" I used to shout like this in despair, and now I still shout like this in despair.</p>
<p>I don't want to see a doctor. In fact, poor people like us can't afford to see a doctor. Even if we have the strength to see a doctor once or twice, there will definitely be no result. I have long known that my disease cannot be treated with medicine. Perhaps natural recuperation will reduce the severity of the disease, but it will definitely not show results in a short period of time. Other than that, there is no better way. Long-term recuperation away from this place is not allowed by the facts, so I have to use some free time every morning and evening to take a walk in Hongkou Park with a heavy heart, trying to dissipate some of the depression in my heart, but as a result, not only can the depression not be dissipated, but I add some free air. Your and my personalities are fundamentally two typicals. You can be more tolerant than me, and I am too narrow-minded. You can not take anything seriously, and I take everything seriously. My insomnia also comes from this. In fact, in such a dark iron age, one should not be serious. I also know that my seriousness has caused me so much free air and knocked on so many nails, and in the end, I have been called a "fool" and laughed at. Thank you for your kindness, often calling me to change my quirks. However, the temper that I was born with cannot be changed, unless I am reincarnated, there may be a possibility of changing it. However, I do accept your kindness, because you are ultimately the only friend who treats me kindly. I won't talk much, so I'll stop here. I wish you well. Shiwu</p>
<h3 id="e215">Village Survey <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Xu Ying</p>
<p>I walked out of the Guandi Temple with a roll of survey forms, thinking as I walked.</p>
<p>Like a dream. The journey of life is full of changes. After graduating from the rural normal school, friends went east and west, like duckweed in a small pond. The duckweed gradually turned into floating clouds, moving endlessly in the north and south. For example, Yan, the person who sent me a roll of survey forms, used to be an ambitious big shot who wanted to recruit soldiers and buy horses to have great ambitions. Who would have thought that after not seeing him for two years, he had already settled into the position of statistician, and was making the slave of numbers. …</p>
<p>The short street was very lively. People were rushing like water, as the New Year was approaching, people were busy going to the city to do business. The main products of our village are homespun cloth, boxes woven from wicker, baskets, baskets, and small toys. The men are really as enthusiastic as gambling at this time, with sweat dripping from their heads. People who knew me kept greeting me on the road, and everyone was burying their heads on their way.</p>
<p>I walked and looked at the questions on those forms. Although the questions were detailed, they were easy to annoy the people who answered them. I thought, I will use this opportunity to talk to the women in the village. It's a pity, since I came here to teach, I haven't gotten a female student over the age of fifteen.</p>
<p>Walking to the first house in the west of the village, I knocked on the door. The "Fu" character on the door was very dim.</p>
<p>Someone came out, took a look through the crack in the door and said, "The boss is not at home, come back in the afternoon!" It was a woman's voice.</p>
<p>"I'm not necessarily looking for the boss, anyone will do," I said.</p>
<p>The woman went inside to coax the child, ignoring me.</p>
<p>After hitting several nails like this, I finally got a chance to talk to an old woman with gray hair. After asking a few questions, the old woman changed her face unexpectedly.</p>
<p>"What are you asking these for?" The old woman rolled her rotten eyelids "I've heard that you're hooked up with the county, asking how much land there is, do you want to increase our donations? Asking how old the old man is, do you want to kneel in the spirit basin? Asking how good the harvest is, why do you teachers ask? Isn't it like this every year? One check, one donation, more taxes. Who isn't saying that there are no good people who come from the city! …"</p>
<p>Covered with this unjust charge, I bit my lip and smiled bitterly again. My footsteps stepped into the next house, and my hand was gently knocking on the door knocker. I suddenly heard a vicious dog barking madly inside, and then a child, calling his mother, came out of the house to open the door. Seeing that it was me, he paused for a moment, and then immediately bowed and shouted "Teacher," so I stroked the top of his green head and asked, "Is Mom at home?"</p>
<p>"Sister is at home!" my little student said.</p>
<p>A very generous small-footed woman walked out of the second door, wearing a blue cloth pants and jacket, with a flat head and a straight face, big eyes, black hair, and a white hair rope on her head. She nodded to me slightly, and asked without shyness, "Does the teacher have anything to do with my mother?"</p>
<p>"It's nothing," I didn't dare to say to this enlightened rural woman, and I was surprised at the beginning. "I have a little survey, I want to ask for advice, it's about various situations in the countryside." I was afraid that she wouldn't understand this kind of talk, so I explained more, like how much land is planted? How many workers are hired? How much rent is collected every year! …</p>
<p>"I know," the woman took over, "When I was staying with Teacher Xiao, she also liked to ask these things, but unfortunately our country people don't know clearly, and they always think it's a donation or a tax, so they misunderstand the teachers' good intentions, and Teacher Xiao and I…"</p>
<p>An old shadow came to mind. I thought: Could this be Wu Er's widow? Going around in a circle, I asked my little student, "Is this your second sister?" He said yes.</p>
<p>She told me many things, things I wanted to know, not just about her own, she also knew clearly about the neighbors. Just as she was talking, an old woman came back from outside, and shouted as she entered the door:</p>
<p>"Knowing or not knowing you are staying in your mother's house, chattering nonsense with someone…"</p>
<p>I surveyed a few more families, and the results were not very good. The next day, Wu's child told me when he went to school: "Sister said, if you haven't finished asking, you can go this afternoon, that's when Mom goes out to play cards."</p>
<p>To be honest, this enlightened woman helped me for the first time in the village survey.</p>
<h3 id="e216">Winter Night <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Fuxi</p>
<p>Standing in the night of December. Everything around is so quiet, so dark. - The clouds in the sky, in blocks, are jet-black and fantastic, as if they have frozen. The street lamps on the utility poles are surrounded by heavy night air. The wind is blowing the lamps, and the light on the ground is swaying there like it has been crushed. In the darkness, the houses on this small street are all closed, without any sound.</p>
<p>The dog is howling in the dark night.</p>
<p>On the street at night; calm, melancholy. The time is midnight. Standing at the entrance of Yanyi Lane, Baoshan Street, is only a young patrolman. He is wearing a black cotton coat, and from afar, he is standing straight like a night ghost. He is on duty for the safety of the residents. No matter which night, he has to stand here for three hours; within three hours, if there are thefts, assassinations, searches, fires, etc. on Baoshan Street, the heavy responsibility will be on the patrolman. For the sake of his duty, he cannot leave his post without authorization: he should be watching the movements of Baoshan every minute.</p>
<p>It's already past one o'clock - tonight.</p>
<p>He was just on duty. His shift time is at four o'clock.</p>
<p>Half an hour ago, he was still dozing in bed, dreaming a hazy dream: he dreamed of hiding with Qiuhua girl by the black gate and joking. He looked at her hair, eyes, breasts, hands, feet, nose, there was nothing that was not beautiful. He grabbed her hand, and as soon as he grasped it, he saw Qiuhua's face turn red, as red as peach blossoms in March; the fiery red cheeks, like those after being drunk, made him excited and crazy. Just as he was about to hug her, the dream suddenly woke up, and it was time to stand guard, so he got up, and then ran to this dark street to stand guard.</p>
<p>He thought, thinking of Qiuhua:</p>
<p>"Qiuhua this little goblin..."</p>
<p>Thinking this way, he couldn't help but smile. That Qiuhua, is a little goblin who lives in the third walled door of Yanyi Lane. He sees her every day when he is on duty during the day; seeing her coming out of Yanyi Lane and going into Yanyi Lane, unknowingly, they hooked up with each other.</p>
<p>Tonight is their date.</p>
<p>He had this dream and ran to Baoshan Street to stand guard. His heart always felt so uneasy; the boundless silence gave him an irresistible threat. On the soles of his feet, it seemed as if oil had been applied, and he could no longer stand steady.</p>
<p>"Oh. At this moment, oh. Qiuhua must be waiting for me there..."</p>
<p>Thinking repeatedly, his black shadow finally moved, and he tiptoed into Yanyi Lane. But in less than a quarter of an hour, the patrolman walked out of Yanyi Lane and stood in the same old place as before.</p>
<p>"Haha! Qiuhua this little goblin..."</p>
<p>Think. A slight smile appeared on his face again.</p>
<h3 id="e217">Evening (1) <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>Evening.</p>
<p>The sky slowly darkened. Like a snake lying in the mud, Sanxin Street also slowly stiffened at this moment, becoming almost a lead-colored street.</p>
<p>In early summer, the evening breeze was warm. People came out to the streets for a stroll, and very few were still wearing long gowns. The clatter of iron-soled slippers echoed on the uneven roads from time to time. Yellow rickshaw pullers, scattered here and there, each holding onto an empty rickshaw, listlessly leaning against the edge of the road: shadows of passersby were cast on the white-gray rickshaw seats from time to time.</p>
<p>Outside a tall Western-style building, two young men appeared at this moment. One tall and one short, a seemingly natural pair. The tall one wore a long cloth gown that did not fit well, thin and short, with Western-style pants dragging on the ground, only the pointed leather shoes visible, rising and falling, stomping on the ground with an air of overwhelming emotion. The short one wore a large-collared white shirt, the long hem reaching his knees. His developed chest had already popped three of the five buttons on the front of his shirt; wearing a pair of Chen Jiageng rubber shoes, he walked lightly across the street; at the same time, his shirt repeatedly puffed out, ostentatiously displaying his overly "inflated" chest to the depressed street.</p>
<p>After walking not far, this natural pair turned left. It was a small street leading to Xinsheng Road.</p>
<p>Although the street was small, it had a grand air. From one end to the other, there were no more than a hundred or so shops. Opium dens and medicinal plaster shops accounted for at least half. These opium dens and plaster shops were not only connected as neighbors but also competed in grandeur, flanking the road on either side.</p>
<p>The sidewalks were completely broken. Pieces of brick were patched together, one after another. Some places were even littered with the wash water and garbage poured out by the homeowners. But pedestrians still came and went in an endless stream. These people mostly had faces like shriveled eggplants. Their mouths were thin and blackened, their hair was withered and messy, their eyes were deeply sunken: coupled with backs arched like cats, and tattered gray-black clothes that exposed elbows and knees – they looked like skeletons freshly unearthed from the ground. Life was superfluous to them.</p>
<p>Yet each of them had a restless desire.</p>
<p>Some used greenish-blue eyes, searching for discarded cigarette butts on the sidewalk or the road; others twitched their noses, sniffing at a fragrance wafting along the street. Every time they passed an opium den with a red-lettered sign, they stopped, sniffing and inhaling repeatedly. At the same time, their eyes could not leave the opium den. Their throats rattled, yawns came in quick succession, and perhaps they would eventually collapse and die at the entrance of the opium den.</p>

<h3 id="e218">Talk About Secrets <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Jue Fu</p>
<p>Children, I can play with a kaleidoscope with great interest, reluctant to put it down; villagers, when they encounter someone performing magic, will stop and watch intently. If the kaleidoscope is taken apart and it is known that it is originally composed of a few colored plastic sheets and a few pieces of glass; if the principles of magic are all understood, and it is known that many of the changes are merely due to skillful techniques: the kaleidoscope will be thrown away from the child's hand, and magic will no longer be able to attract passersby. The reason why these two things are valued is because of their secrets.</p>
<p>Children find everything fun, no matter what they encounter; country bumpkins find everything in the city interesting, precisely because they do not understand the secrets within various things.</p>
<p>A taciturn person often evokes admiration and awe; he is unwilling to reveal the secrets in his heart, making himself seem unfathomable, which is also a reason.</p>
<p>The reason why humanity can be passed down from generation to generation, never feeling tired or stagnant, is said to be because life itself is a great mystery, and the secrets of the universe can never be completely deciphered, which may also be a reason: if all the things in the universe are understood, and the ultimate meaning of life is completely clear, perhaps humanity would become extinct.</p>
<p>The function of secrets is so worthy of praise!</p>
<p>We Chinese deeply understand this principle, and our utilization of secrets is far superior to others. This can be seen simply by looking at our compatriots' consistent way of handling affairs, not emphasizing analysis, not paying attention to logic, but only relying on intuition and speculation, vaguely glossing over matters.</p>
<p>In recent years, is "open secret" not a very fashionable term? This is also because some of our compatriots have recognized the greatness of the function of secrets, so even matters that are originally public are made to carry a bit of mystery.</p>
<p>Unwilling to unravel the secrets of matters, but only making superficial observations, is indeed our cleverness: because in this way, we can save ourselves a lot of trouble and enjoy a lot of immediate joy. However, as a result, while others have evolved to the point of soaring in the sky, we are still stagnating in an era of using feet as transportation, which is still a shortcoming!</p>
<h3 id="e219">Fishing Boat <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Ya Fei</p>
<p>It was an evening approaching darkness; the northwest wind was blowing in the sky, and a setting sun from the west was blown colorless, as if it was about to fall.</p>
<p>The bare branches on the old mulberry tree howled in the wind; not a single bird could be found in the surrounding area.</p>
<p>In the corner of Taihu Lake, a long stone embankment stretched out, sheltering many fishing boats, one, two, three... crowded together. — Chacha — chacha — the sound of sharpening hooks, and — huh — huh — the sound of mending nets echoed each other. The fishing boats could not withstand the waves, drifting on the water like leaves; the masts on several cargo boats also swayed in the air, while the boatmen hid in the cabins.</p>
<p>"Gengsheng, we have to set sail earlier today; with such a strong wind, there will surely be good business," Guisheng said to the person on the boat next door while sharpening his hooks.</p>
<p>"I think the wind on the outer lake is too strong today; we can't go to Miaoshan Dike. It's better to check the situation at Xiwang Bay. It's fine for you to go to Ziwan Bay," Gengsheng replied, puffing on his pipe, looking at the sky with experience.</p>
<p>"Yes, there are several fish nests there, and since the planting— until now, we haven't even recovered the capital!"</p>
<p>"One year of heavy rain, one year of drought, the fish in Taihu Lake, those that escape, those that are caught, maybe in two or three years, even the fish fry will be gone! This year is really terrible. The fishery tax from last winter is still owed. There was no snow in winter, but spring snow keeps falling. It looks like it won't be a good year! Sigh!"</p>
<p>"The heavens want to play tricks on us poor people. There's no way. We still have to live. Besides this broken fishing boat and that net, we can't find another way to survive. Moreover, my family's rice for tomorrow's breakfast is still on the hook. Tonight, we should eat dinner early and go out and try our luck!" Guisheng finished speaking and lowered his head to sharpen his hooks.</p>
<p>Both of them were silent for a long time, except for the sound of sharpening hooks, mending nets, and the whistling north wind, everything else was silent, as silent as death.</p>
<p>Darkness crept into the human world; the entire nature was ruled by darkness; there was no moon or stars in the sky, but the wind was even more rampant than before.</p>
<p>Not a single fishing boat could be seen in that corner; on the dark lake surface, only scattered fishing lights appeared, swaying up and down.</p>
<p>At that time, Guisheng was squatting on the bow of the boat, using his skilled and experienced night eyes, watching the movement of the water. He held his breath, not even daring to breathe. The boy shaking the boat was always following Guisheng's instructions, rowing back and forth. Because the tattered cotton coat on his body was not enough to keep out the cold, his body was shivering like chaff.</p>
<p>Rowing along an arc-shaped bay around Yashan, the shadows of Dalongtou and Xiaolongtou mountains were still faintly visible. Guisheng tightly held the net rope, and his body couldn't help but shiver. The waves hit the boat, agitating the small boat like a startled animal, almost knocking Guisheng off the bow.</p>
<p>"Damn it, the wind is too strong, I can't hold on, there's no hope!" He gasped!</p>
<p>Strings of water droplets flew on the edge of his broken felt hat, forming icicles; even his tattered cotton coat was covered with ice spots. He could no longer struggle in such a cold wind; all the blood in his body had frozen, and he had lost all sensation in his hands and feet. He hurriedly pulled up the net and threw it into the boat; it was so heavy, but the "plop!" sound didn't sound like fish. He examined it and saw pieces of ice hanging on the net rope, bright and shining. There was only one fish, weighing no more than three or two taels. He checked the small harpoon and found a small fish the size of a holly leaf. He sighed and said nothing; the boat boy, without strength, rowed the boat into the corner, but the sky was already the color of a fish's belly!</p>
<h3 id="e220">Winter at Xuanwu Lake <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Zong Xin</p>
<p>Stone City, formerly a famous scenic spot in Jiangnan during the Six Dynasties, is now Kyoto. In people's imagination, there are beautiful mountains and rivers, and famous historical sites. One should take a trip to Nanjing!</p>
<p>People living a wandering life in the big city, the sound of machines, the gas of cars, have felt particularly tired, dragging the gray life of the cross of thousands of pounds of life, even more want to escape to the beautiful mountains, lakeside, to relax. Then, the head of Stone City seems to be swaying in my mind.</p>
<p>Holding a jumping heart, I was intercepted by the train like a long snake crawling into the bottom of Stone City, the desolate mountains and piles on the edge of the city, the old city walls, although indifferent, also have a bit of high spirit. This is the famous Stone City!</p>
<p>However, living in the city, I feel that: other than being more deserted than Shanghai, there is nothing to relieve boredom. It is so mediocre, leaving behind the thick old Chinese sentiment.</p>
<p>Going to the First Park, unintentionally walking along a city river like a shit ditch, a friend pointed to the black water below and said: "This is the Qinhuai River!" I was a little surprised: "Is this the beautiful and charming Qinhuai River?" Ah, there is no pleasant singing, some small boats on the river are quietly lying there, vaguely flashing some tattered figures.</p>
<p>Not very interested, the heart to visit the famous city. Bored at a friend's house, feeling extremely bored. I remembered reading an article about the autumn of Xuanwu, which aroused my interest, and I went to Xuanwu Lake. Now it is winter, what kind of appearance does Xuanwu Lake have!</p>
<p>Arriving at the edge of Xuanwu Gate, looking up at the high city head, my heart could not help but beat faster. Beautiful Xuanwu Lake, a haggard and dry person's heart, will immediately be immersed in your embrace. I am pre-rich, that joyful kindness when dissipating infinite troubles. I love the beautiful scenery by the lake the most!</p>
<p>Slowly, with a look of complete indulgence, I walked out of Xuanwu Gate. Looking around, the leafless willows hung down withered, as indifferent as my gray mood, and my heart gradually calmed down. Looking closely, the sides of the dirt road are full of these decaying willows. Under the willows are decorated with a few vendors selling peanuts and the like. The tourists are so scattered, I can't see a noble person wearing fashionable clothes, only a few passersby!</p>
<p>Before the small hillocks of Xuanwu Gate unfolded to the east, a few short houses were scattered, so desolate and quiet, a friend raised his finger and said: "I often fantasize about renting a small house here, but it is really too desolate!"</p>
<p>I looked at the lake water under the city, which was not blue, and the gray-black leaves floating everywhere. It was a bit frozen, not obvious, I thought to myself: this is Xuanwu Lake! It's just a vague sense of cold. But I still wanted to find some scenery to relieve my boredom on the desolate and cold Xuanwu Lake. Chao Ji was pointing his finger and saying. "You don't know, Xuanwu Lake does have its merits, but unfortunately it is winter. In spring, summer, and autumn, the willows on both sides are green, hanging down so elegantly, and the lake is full of lotus flowers blooming. Boating on the lake with two or three tourists is quite interesting!"</p>
<p>But now the lake is just full of stagnant water, scattered with many dead leaves. Not a single boat is floating on the lake, although the boat owners by the lake are greeting us, saying that for only twenty copper plates, we can go around the lake once and come back, but we did not pay attention to them.</p>
<p>Walking along the lake, the desolate heart is still desolate, the dead leaves on the lake are scattered all over the vast lake surface, we can only talk to each other, it is already desolate, let's go back! Facing Xuanwu Gate, we entered the city. I felt like I hadn't been to Xuanwu at all. Famous city is also. I still feel very strange! It's like I haven't visited Stone City at all.</p>

<p>— Jiang Ye</p>
<p>"Friend: Stop crying, even if you die, in twenty years, you will be a great man again."</p>
<p>His companions called him Lao Li from Shandong, but he was still a stubborn person. He had been locked in this wooden cage for more than ten days, and he had never seen him unhappy; he spent his days talking about happy stories with his companions, and his blood-red face always had a smiling expression. Now, he was a little saddened by the crying of the companion who had just been locked in this morning. The more impatient he became, the more afraid he was of hearing the sobbing cries, he suppressed the fire of anger in his heart, walked to the side of the crying companion, patted him on the shoulder and said.</p>
<p>That companion, since coming here this morning, had not eaten a single meal, but only hid on the wooden bed or stood by the wooden railing crying. This not only made the Shandong fellow and all the companions in the cell uneasy, but even the people in the surrounding cells became impatient. Originally, no one would think about other things, but just talked and laughed all day long, but because of him, everyone's heart could no longer be at peace.</p>
<p>The Shandong fellow was more anxious than anyone else, and his flushed face became even redder. Seeing that all the people in the cell were ruined by the companion's crying, he felt angry in his heart, not thinking about himself: a person who has lived to be twenty or thirty years old is still like a woman, even if it is a big deal, he can think about it secretly, always crying like this, will the official give you a way out? There really are such fools in the world!</p>
<p>The more the Shandong fellow thought about it, the more ridiculous he felt, the more he saw the companion crying harder, the more he felt his own greatness. Indeed, the Shandong fellow was a hero, he often said to his companions:</p>
<p>"I have been living alone outside since I was sixteen years old, I have done everything, I have enjoyed all the happiness, and I have suffered all the hardships, so what is jail, just die! Hmph, in twenty years I will be a great man again, what is there to be afraid of, don't think too little of yourself!"</p>
<p>This heroic thought of his, almost everyone in the cell was infected by him a little. Whenever he talked about his past life, what he had done in the past, he would smile. Since he was locked in this cage, all the companions here were happy to chat with him, even those who did odd jobs outside liked to listen to his stories.</p>
<p>But since this morning, he has been very unhappy because the companion cried too much. Although he was angry that the companion shouldn't cry, his deep heart was also a little sad. He didn't say a word all day, and he inadvertently turned to his own unhappy thoughts.</p>
<p>The daytime in winter is very short. Suddenly, it became naturally dark, and although the companion was already crying and only sobbing, his heart was even more sad. He stared blankly at the dark sky, spacing out.</p>
<p>When distributing the blankets, the Shandong fellow always joked with the old man. But tonight, he sat motionless in that corner, silent. After the old man left, he grabbed an iron-like blanket, and lay down with a few people from Guangdong. At this time, the people in the cell were talking and laughing about him in a chaotic way. He silently burrowed into the bedding, even his breathing was very low.</p>
<p>He was thinking, thinking that this time he would definitely lose his life, and he also thought of his family, wife, son, and old mother. He thought of his whole life, and he also thought of his encounter that would explode in front of him soon. He felt terrible in his heart, and his heart became as cold as ice. It seemed that the death god's poisonous whip was whipping his brave ambition.</p>
<p>The sound of crying sounded in his ears again, he opened his eyes and stared hatefully at the crying companion. That icy heart was burning with the heat of life again. He knew he couldn't be so fragile. He should be a hero, he shouted loudly to that companion:</p>
<p>"Friend: Stop crying, even if you die, in twenty years you will be a great man again."</p>
<h3 id="e222">Boring Days <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Simon</p>
<p>It is not necessarily because of being idle all day long, with empty hands and empty feet, that one feels an overwhelming sense of boredom. Boredom does not really exist in action, but rather in the mind, in things that are too familiar, and in habits that are exhausted. Often when one feels inexplicably bored in the house, one thinks of going out for a stroll, but without a destination, dragging slow steps, the heart is already very bored. Since one is out, one simply follows where the legs lead, wandering aimlessly, not knowing when one will stop, or where one will go. When one comes out, one still holds a faint thought of relieving boredom, but after walking for a while, one's body already feels somewhat tired, so quickly giving up that little thought, only feeling an unspeakable boredom, almost bored to the point where one is too lazy to walk.</p>
<p>The feelings of boredom are most subtle, and at the same time, most illusory. This subtlety and illusion are completely impossible to explain with words, and can only be deeply tasted by oneself. The heart is like stepping on a pile of cotton, swaying remotely; the heart is like a deep, bottomless hole, empty and vast. One cannot sit still, cannot lie still, everything feels dull and rigid. Nothing is exciting. The depravity of the mood has reached its extreme. Lying in bed, thinking of falling asleep for a while, perhaps being able to drive away the boredom, but it is useless. Despite closing one's eyes tightly, one cannot fall asleep, so one becomes more irritable. One climbs up and casually opens a book to flip through, but one cannot read it, after reading a few lines, one throws it away, still bored. Nothing can arouse interest, an endless sense of boredom envelops the entire body and mind. The more one searches for something to play with to eliminate this boredom, the more serious the boredom becomes.</p>
<p>Usually, there are many ways to pass the time that one likes, or things that one has a considerable interest in. But now, that doesn't work either. Thinking about them gives me a headache; those things have completely lost the interest they used to give me.</p>
<p>I am almost so anxious that I want to groan out loud. Boredom has simply become a painful symptom. Locked in the house, pacing back and forth endlessly, a person is as if the heart has been drawn out. After walking for a long time, if the steps one has taken are connected, one really doesn't know how far it is. But other than adding to the heavy feeling of boredom, there is nothing else. When busy with work and rest, as soon as the sky dawns, one buries oneself at the desk, and the day's tasks have not been properly sorted out, and in the blink of an eye, the sky has darkened. At such times, one will often unconsciously sigh towards the setting sun in the west: why does time pass so quickly? But when bored, although time also passes quickly, one still thinks that time is passing too slowly.</p>
<p>I have suffered enough from the torment of boredom. If one says that the reason for having a sense of boredom is always because one is full all day long, and has nothing to do, then that is not the case. Every day, there are really many things I should do, I am only afraid of not being able to do them completely, naturally there is no leisure. Already having so many tasks entangled, one should be busy in body and mind, so why do I always complain of boredom? This is confusing even to myself. I can't think of a real reason, perhaps it is mostly due to the fact that although there are things to do, certain things originally have a certain passion and meaning, but as time goes by, perseverance gradually fades, fading to the point of completely disappearing, and the meaning of certain things themselves also perishes.</p>

<p>— Jiang Tian</p>
<p>It was getting dark, and the withered branches on both sides of the road were being blown east and west by the north wind, making noise. This quiet Huiai East Road was even quieter.</p>
<p>Old Wang, with two textbooks and a student's paper wrapped in his arms, was walking along the road listlessly.</p>
<p>"Old Wang: Where are you going? Did you get your salary today?"</p>
<p>Mr. Li walked up behind Old Wang, patted him on the shoulder and asked. At this moment, Old Wang was thinking about the salary matter, and Mr. Li's question made him feel angry. He stared at Mr. Li with his round eyes and said:</p>
<p>"Old Li, don't mention it. Not only didn't I get it today, but I also got a scolding. Damn it, this is really not something a human should do. Teaching only leads to starvation!"</p>
<p>"Old Wang, is it just you who gets scolded, aren't other people the same? I also don't want to do this job, but... I can't find anything else to do."</p>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>"Old friend; you're still okay, but I'm in trouble! My wife is seriously ill at home, and I'm not feeling well myself. Damn it, they don't pay my salary, they already owe me five months! I can't get a single penny."</p>
<p>When Old Wang thought of his wife, he felt even angrier. His heart was numb with anger. He looked at Mr. Li, lowered his head, and didn't say a word.</p>
<p>"Old friend; don't worry too much, we're just unlucky. Let's find something else to do! This is a very hard way to make a living. Goodbye!"</p>
<p>Mr. Li waved to him as he spoke, and walked into a dark alley. Old Wang shook his head, sighed, and walked home.</p>
<p>"Damn it, I'm coming back empty-handed again today, what will my wife do?"</p>
<p>As soon as Old Wang stepped into the door, he seemed to have no strength in his feet as he walked upstairs, thinking about this in his heart.</p>
<p>Old Wang ran into the room, put down the textbooks and student papers, and walked to his wife's bedside. Her face was pale, she was breathing weakly, and her eyes were deeply sunken. Tears seemed to be hanging in her deep eye sockets. When Old Wang saw his wife's appearance at this time, he felt even more anger in his heart. He held her thin hand and cursed in his heart:</p>
<p>"Damn it, everything is because of not having money, five months without pay?"</p>
<p>His wife opened her deeply sunken eyes, and tears rolled down from her eye sockets, looking at him, speaking very weakly, almost inaudible. When he heard these words, he felt even more sad. A shadow of grief and sorrow tightly covered his heart. He felt his breathing was suffocating, and he felt that all the misery in the world was unbearable. At this moment, he thought of the golden age of the past, the happiness of love, his deceased parents, and his younger brother who went to teach in Nanyang. He thought of everything in the past. A wave of dizziness came over him, and the room seemed to be spinning...</p>

<p>Parrots sing in the red building at the end of spring. She leans against the curved railing, charming and graceful. Her clever mind moves her double pupils, and red clouds fill her peach cheeks as she thinks. She knows herself to be a quiet and secluded woman. She studies the Western Chamber and learns to write in pairs. Thoughts of love and romantic debts will only be cleared when her fragrance fades and her jade shatters. Otherwise, she will never forgive. She remembers the first meeting in the garden, his naturally handsome face and thin lips. He has imprisoned her body and bound her heart, causing her to forget the teachings of her family. The young man in the boudoir can be said to be new and joyful. Sometimes they sit with their legs crossed, sometimes they walk shoulder to shoulder. Sometimes they drink from the same cup and talk heart to heart. Sometimes she smokes, and he swallows the fishy remnants. It is difficult to describe the kind of affection. Sometimes she looks in the mirror at the dressing table, and he helps her arrange her hair and insert kites. He adjusts the powder and grease, each item being delicate and funny. It is ridiculous that he is familiar with the romantic handbook, just like the young Zhou Lang who is good at using troops. He actually defeated the female army. If they have to part for a moment, they are reluctant to separate. Butterflies love flowers and flowers love butterflies, you must pity me and I pity you. If there is no news for half a month, then she will weave a circular pattern to express her feelings. Truly, your heart matches my heart.</p>

<h3 id="e228">Analysis of "Force" in Ancient Chinese Architecture <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Hao</p>
<p>China has exerted great effort in promoting architecture throughout the dynasties. From the Qin and Han dynasties to the Song and Yuan dynasties, exquisite buildings that dominated the world were continuously produced. In today's metropolises, we can still find traces of them. Although they have been battered by wind and rain for thousands or hundreds of years, they still stand majestically. We can imagine the solidity and durability of this oriental architecture.</p>
<p>Another aspect of oriental architecture that is most satisfying is its "color." Foreigners call it "oriental color." Its delicate and appropriate arrangement cannot be compared to any other building in the world. We can observe this from the palaces and temples left behind by previous dynasties.</p>
<p>Our ancient architecture was so exquisite and solid, why are we gradually neglecting it now and striving to adopt Western methods? There is indeed a big problem here—the problem of "force."</p>
<p>If we quietly observe the structure of the ancient palaces and temples that still exist today with scientific eyes, we can discover that the force on each pillar and beam is "compressive force." Because we did not have steel as a building material in the past, the wood used was very thick, making the entire building solid. The more solid the building, the thicker the wood used. In this way, the "compressive force" on each piece of wood greatly increased. This huge compressive force only allows for horizontal development of general buildings and does not allow for vertical development. Therefore, most ancient Chinese buildings have wide halls and courtyards, but few have high-rise buildings with dozens of floors. This type of building would absolutely not exist in the twenty-first century city where land is worth its weight in gold.</p>
<p>The structure of modern buildings not only has compressive force but also tensile force and other forces. Sometimes several forces are mixed together, resulting in mutual cancellation. In this way, the force that each unit can withstand increases, and the number of floors of the building can be increased as much as possible. Just look at the lightweight steel frames of modern times, which majestically support dozens of floors of concrete buildings without the slightest danger. This is the result of being able to make ingenious use of "force."</p>
<p>Ancient architects did not seem to pay attention to the use of tensile force. In fact, the tensile force of wood is extremely weak, and even if it is used, there is a risk of fracture!</p>
<p>In addition to the compressive force on the wood, each square brick in ancient buildings is subjected to huge compressive force. They all bear considerable responsibility for supporting the entire building. In this way, the increase in the weight of the bricks hinders the construction of multi-story buildings, which is another fatal flaw in ancient architecture.</p>
<p>In short, the failure to skillfully apply the distribution of "force" in ancient Chinese architecture is probably the main reason for its gradual decline!</p>
<h3 id="e229">A General Overview of Shanghai Construction in the Past Year (II) <a href="#e229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Dehui</p>
<p>In the French Concession, the total value of construction in October of last year was 10,841,000 yuan. The prosperity of construction in January and February was unparalleled, almost tripling compared to the same period in the 22nd year of the Republic. January was 925,000 yuan, and February was 1,045,000 yuan, and most of the buildings were grand apartment projects, hence such value. In particular, the 14-story apartment at the corner of Route Petain and Route Wenhlin was worth several million yuan. There were also several 8- and 9-story buildings. The construction value in March was 2,924,000 yuan, and in April was 1,361,000 yuan. The value in May was relatively low, only 771,000 yuan, and in June it was 805,150 yuan. In these six months, a total of 7,831,150 yuan was spent. Although the value in May and June was low, it was still 190% higher than the same period in the 22nd year of the Republic. If we classify the buildings, there were 25 apartments, 133 Western-style houses, 48 semi-Western-style halls, 324 Chinese-style residences, 83 stores, 7 factories, 4 schools, and 48 other buildings. The total value of construction in July and August was 2,450,000 yuan. In these two months, the weather was extremely hot, but the value of construction increased compared to May and June. This is a sign of the booming construction in the French Concession in recent years. There were 72 Western-style halls, 80 semi-Western-style halls, and 64 Chinese-style residences. Among them, the large-scale projects were the French Police Station, worth 150,000 yuan, and two hospitals, worth more than 500,000 yuan in total. If we average the construction value of these eight months, it is about 1,250,000 yuan per month. However, in September, it plummeted to 383,000 yuan, and in October, it fell further to 176,500 yuan. This is not a surprising fact. We know that population and construction are originally linked. The population of the French Concession only increased to 0.33% last year, compared to 4.94% in the 20th and 21st years of the Republic, and 3.75% in the 21st and 22nd years of the Republic, a difference of ten times! Because of this, most of the Chinese-style housing constructed in the French Concession last year, apart from the grand apartment buildings, was renovated from old halls. We can see that the western part of the concession is full of tall apartment buildings, which shows the recent construction trend in the French Concession. This type of apartment building is suitable for the needs of general residents in Shanghai, so it is a very developed type of construction, and it can also be said to be an aspiration for a garden city (to be continued).</p>
<h3 id="e230">Steel and its Protection Methods (Continued) <a href="#e230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>To meet the first requirement, architects have used a type of steel material called "metallic wood," which is made by cold-rolling or bending flat steel sheets or strips. It has great strength in construction. It is used as studs, panels, etc., and flanges are used to increase its strength. There have been many improvements recently. Regarding joints, there are two points: one is the joint between steel materials, and the other is the joint between steel materials and other objects. The joints between ordinary steels are all made by forging, either by spark type, resistance type, or other various forging methods. The joints between steel and other objects vary depending on the object, and the results of research by engineers have also been improved and varied. How can their types be counted? As for durability, evidence from past facts and experiments shows that the durability of steel is higher than that of other building materials. In dry air, steel can maintain its original state indefinitely. Even under normal circumstances, it is not a problem to maintain it for thirty to forty years. However, attacks by mixtures and corrosion by chemical substances such as acidic vapors can easily shorten its life.</p>
<p>There are three common methods for protecting steel sheets in construction:</p>
<p>(1) Paint protective layer. If we place steel in dry air, its quality will not change even after a hundred years, and it will be as strong as the beginning. This is because the surface of the steel itself has already combined with the oxygen in the air to form an extremely thin layer of oxide, preventing further oxidation. However, under ordinary circumstances, we have to apply paint to protect its surface so that it does not come into contact with water vapor or other harmful substances. Red lead paint is very effective. Other paints, such as those using zinc oxide, lead and chromium compounds, white lead, blue lead, etc. as fillers, can also be used. Before applying the paint, the dust and dirt on the steel surface must be removed to make it dry, and then the paint is applied with a brush or by spraying. According to the results of experiments by American architects, steel sheets coated with red lead paint were still intact after thirty-five years. It can be seen that if steel is properly protected, its durability is extremely high, and it is important to repair cracks or paint peeling off immediately. This paint protection method is commonly used.</p>
<p>(2) Coating protection layer. The light of coating steel surfaces was first achieved by the method of galvanizing. Later, Europeans used magnetic surfaces to protect steel, which was a very good method. Therefore, Americans have also recently started to follow suit. There are several advantages of coating: first, its color can be arbitrarily matched; second, its durability; and third, it is easy to clean. The coating method is to apply a magnetic liquid to the steel surface at a temperature of about 3,000 degrees Fahrenheit. Magnetic materials contain the most sand and boron, so their texture is firm and can prevent the erosion of all water vapor and acids. The magnetic material adheres to the steel surface with great adhesion, and will only fail when the strength of the steel is insufficient. Coated steel sheets are suitable for outdoor and internal edge decoration, and can be made more colorful by adding copper joints.</p>
<p>(3) Resin protective layer. Resin is made artificially, dissolved in a suitable deep liquid, and added with opaque filler, and then applied to the steel surface. This type of protective layer is generally used for those that are urgently needed and must be dried immediately. Its durability is very strong, and it is also used on automobiles, utensils, and gas stations, but its price seems to be more expensive than the other two types.</p>
<p>In addition to those with a protective layer, there are also steel sheets that do not need protection, which is what we usually call stainless steel. Stainless steel contains a small amount of chromium, so under normal circumstances, an extremely thin protective layer of compound is formed on its surface, but it still does not lose its original luster, so it is called stainless steel. Stainless steel has been used more and more widely in recent years, and it also has great potential in construction. By virtue of its strong strength and rust-proof characteristics, it can fulfill both the engineering and aesthetic missions in construction. This is why European and American architects are happy to use it. It is suitable for all steel plates, steel sheets, steel bars, steel pipes, steel wires, steel nails, and cast models. Its future development is truly limitless.</p>

<p>— Zhu Zhenmu</p>
<p>Section 4: Categories of Building Materials</p>
<p>There are only two categories of materials used in construction: metals and non-metals.</p>
<p>Metallic building materials can be further divided into three types: ferrous metals, non-ferrous metals, and alloys.</p>
<p>(1) Ferrous Metals:</p>
<p>(A) Pig Iron Category:</p>
<p>1.  Overview—Pig iron, cast iron, and semi-steel all belong to this category.</p>
<p>2.  General Properties—Contains a large amount of carbon. Has a crystalline structure, is hard and brittle, and lacks ductility.</p>
<p>3.  Applications—Used for refining wrought iron and steel; also used to make pig iron furniture.</p>
<p>(B) Wrought Iron Category:</p>
<p>1.  Overview—Similar to low-grade steel.</p>
<p>2.  General Properties—Contains 0.12% carbon. Is highly ductile, can be forge-welded, and is more resistant to rust.</p>
<p>3.  Applications—Water pipes and other wrought iron furniture and items.</p>
<p>(C) Steel Category:</p>
<p>1.  Overview—Steel is made by mixing and refining iron and carbon, usually containing 1.25% carbon. Other metals can also be added to achieve various effects. (More details will be provided later). Manufacturing methods include the open-hearth process, the Bessemer process, and the electric arc furnace process, which will be discussed in later chapters.</p>
<p>2.  General Properties—All types of steel are ductile and melt easily.</p>
<p>3.  Applications—Steel skeletons and steel bars are fundamental to construction.</p>
<p>(2) Non-Ferrous Metals:</p>
<p>(A) Copper Category:</p>
<p>1.  Overview—Refined from copper ore and made into sheets or wires.</p>
<p>2.  General Properties—Extremely high electrical conductivity, good ductility, but its strength and durability are far less than that of steel.</p>
<p>3.  Applications—Used for electrical wires, roofs, pipes, decorations, etc.</p>
<p>(B) Aluminum Category:</p>
<p>1.  Overview—Extracted from alumina by removing oxygen.</p>
<p>2.  General Properties—The lightest in specific gravity, only 0.82 pounds per cubic foot. Highly conductive and has great strength.</p>
<p>3.  Applications—Household items, also used as an additive in copper.</p>
<p>(C) Lead, Zinc, Tin, Nickel, etc. Category:</p>
<p>1.  Overview—All refined from ore.</p>
<p>2.  Applications—All mixed into copper and iron to impart various properties and effects.</p>
<p>(3) Alloys:</p>
<p>(A) Brass:</p>
<p>1.  Overview—An alloy of copper and zinc.</p>
<p>2.  Properties—Resistant to corrosion.</p>
<p>3.  Applications—Used for hinges.</p>
<p>(B) White Copper (Paktong):</p>
<p>1.  Overview—An alloy of copper and tin.</p>
<p>2.  Properties—Resistant to corrosion; more valuable than pure copper.</p>
<p>3.  Applications—Used for hinges, decorations, etc.</p>
<p>Non-metallic building materials can be roughly divided into eight categories, listed as follows:</p>
<p>(A) Wood Category:</p>
<p>1.  Overview—Cut from forests in the mountains.</p>
<p>2.  General Properties—Easy for temporary construction, easy to cut down, and strong when subjected to small external forces.</p>
<p>3.  Applications—Can be used for wallboards, pillars, beams, horizontal bars, and rafters.</p>
<p>(B) Cement and Aggregate Category:</p>
<p>1.  Overview—Cement is made by roasting limestone, clay, etc. Aggregate is a mixture of cement, sand, water, and gravel, also known as reinforced concrete.</p>
<p>2.  General Properties—Strong in compression but weak in tension.</p>
<p>3.  Applications—Can be used for plastering walls, laying foundations, and pouring floors.</p>
<p>(C) Mortar:</p>
<p>1.  Overview—Made by mixing cement, clean water, lime, and sand.</p>
<p>2.  General Properties—Extremely adhesive.</p>
<p>3.  Applications—Used for plastering walls and bonding bricks and stones.</p>
<p>(D) Brick Category:</p>
<p>1.  Overview—Bricks include gray bricks and ceramic bricks, all made by firing clay.</p>
<p>2.  General Properties—Hard and brittle, with high compressive strength.</p>
<p>3.  Applications—Can be used for building walls and stacking partitions. (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e232">Letter to the Editor <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>To the esteemed Editor,</p>
<p>Having read the section concerning a certain specialized school on Jiangxi Road, as mentioned by you in the "Letters" column of issue 108, it is entirely inconsistent with the facts. The reason why our school added an advanced class in the Department of Architecture was in response to requests from various parties. It specializes in teaching reinforced concrete and steel construction design and calculation techniques. The intention is to cater to those who already have a foundation in drafting but lack the ability to calculate reinforced concrete. It is estimated that the course can be completed in six months. The course only covers two subjects, and students already have a foundation in drafting, so they can master the skills within this half year. We have never claimed it to be a "higher architecture discipline," and the name "advanced class" is only relative to the beginner-level class. Your assumption of the term "higher architecture discipline" is clearly inconsistent with the facts. Here is the advertisement that our school previously distributed, to clarify the facts: "Our school is now adding an advanced class in the Department of Architecture in response to various requests. We have hired the German architect Mr. Hoffbin to serve as professor and head of the Department of Architecture. The advanced class specializes in teaching reinforced concrete and steel construction design and calculation techniques. Classes are held every Tuesday and Thursday evening from 7 PM to 9 PM. The monthly tuition is thirty yuan, and the course lasts for six months. Anyone who has a foundation in drafting, can understand English lectures, and wishes to further their studies to register with the Ministry of Industry, please register quickly and pay a registration fee of two yuan to reserve a spot and avoid missing out."</p>
<p>The strict enforcement of the industrial technician registration regulations by the Ministry of Industry is indeed true. It is not easy for those who did not graduate from a school to be approved as technicians, and even applying to register as assistant technicians is difficult. It is also common for applicants to be summoned to Beijing for an interview. Therefore, those who did not graduate from a school and intend to register with the Ministry of Industry must have a thorough understanding of reinforced concrete calculation techniques to be confident. Our school established the advanced class to facilitate those who want to supplement their knowledge. The advertisement does not imply "registration upon completion of the course." How can you say it is "using registration as bait"?</p>
<p>The tuition fee is based on practical considerations. With six students, the monthly tuition revenue is one hundred and eighty yuan, which is not excessive. I do not know what you are basing your claim of "fraudulent behavior" on. Furthermore, the term "fraud" is a criminal offense under the law. If the other party does not engage in such behavior, the accuser will be subject to retaliation. Our school is in its early stages, and everything is being created from scratch. We are willing to sincerely accept guidance or criticism. If you believe the tuition fee is too high, there is room for discussion. Furthermore, our school added the advanced class to provide supplementary education for both Chinese and foreign students in the same class. It is not "flaunting foreigners to attract attention." The logic is clear. If you hope to provide benevolent guidance, our school is still willing to sincerely accept it. Your publication's principles are upright and respected. We hope your intention is not malicious. Since you have published the original letter, we hope you will also grant publication to this letter. We are grateful for your assistance. Best regards. Zhizhi Hai Vocational School, February 15th.</p>

<h3 id="e233">Rambling Talk by the Big-Mouthed Comedian Joe E. Brown <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Xi Lin</p>
<p>Joe E. Brown's greatest talent is making people laugh, but he also has his serious moments. When a Hollywood film magazine invited him to be an honorary editor for a day, sitting at the editor's desk, he wrote the following serious article. It can be considered an editorial, and although the words are rambling, they still have some sense. Therefore, I have translated it:</p>
<p>The first point he discusses is "The Obligation of Stars." He says: "Movie stars often talk about their artistic obligations to fans—how to maintain a certain standard in their work. That's great! But in my opinion, there's something equally important: they must remember that they also have a moral responsibility to the public who admire them. That means their behavior and personal affairs should have an uplifting effect on the public.</p>
<p>"On this point, I'm not saying that movie stars have to wear a moralistic face all day long, never joking or laughing. I'm not saying they have to get up early every day to sing hymns and pray before meals. But I believe they must be very careful about their personal morality and their actions in public places, and be an example to society. Simply put, I believe a movie star has the power to encourage people to improve, but also to influence them to become degenerate. I have children myself, so perhaps I take this issue too seriously, but I feel that all movie stars, occupying an important position in the public's mind, should have this awareness."</p>
<p>The second point Joe E. Brown mentions is "Stars Can't Deceive." He says: "When ordinary people hear about how romantic life is in Hollywood, they should remember: stars can't deceive the camera. Lust and insomnia will always show on their faces, and there's no hiding it. Filming starts at nine o'clock. They have to get up at six-thirty in the morning. If they can leave the set at six in the afternoon, they're lucky. After leaving the set, removing makeup and changing clothes takes at least another hour. So they don't get home for dinner until seven in the evening at the earliest. After dinner, there are many things to prepare for the next day's work. If they also need seven or eight hours of sleep, they simply don't have any time to be reckless. In short, Hollywood is not a place for reckless people to stay for long. If they want to stay in Hollywood, they can't be reckless. Please don't believe the rumors!"</p>
<p>The third point is "Hollywood Children." He says: "Hollywood children are very happy. This isn't because their parents earn a lot of money, giving them the finest food, housing, and education. It's really because the people in the film industry raise their children in a very good and commendable way. The people gathered in Hollywood now are very noble men and women, and their descendants will certainly not let their parents down when they grow up. But there's one thing I hope: that Hollywood won't become too big, so that there's no space for children to play. Children can't always play in the garden; they need a large space to dig caves and play cowboys. Open space is essential for any society. The open space in Hollywood is gradually becoming insufficient."</p>
<p>The fourth point he makes is "Hollywood Has Changed." He says: "Hollywood has changed, and you can see it from the Christmas gifts. In the past, every Christmas in Hollywood, everyone would give each other gifts of diamonds or platinum. Stars would give directors new sports cars and square-cut gemstones. Set designers and lighting technicians knew they were out of favor if they didn't receive three or four watches by Christmas. Female reporters usually received at least a set of silverware. Everyone used the most expensive gifts to express their affection.</p>
<p>"But this year it's different! Almost everyone is using their brains to buy reasonable things, and buying very little. If they have extra money, they're buying everyday items to distribute to the poor. Hollywood has really made a lot of progress in this regard, and the knowledge and insights are all lessons learned from the recession."</p>
<p>Joe E. Brown visited Shanghai last year. His impressions of China are also mentioned in his essay. He says: "When I arrived in China, I didn't feel like a movie star was anything special. But I enjoyed more freedom because the Chinese people didn't chase after stars for autographs, although they liked to meet and talk with stars. I like the Chinese people very much because I believe their friendly attitude is very sincere."</p>
<h3 id="e234">Soviet Film Exhibition Delegates Zhou Jianyun and Hu Die to Depart Soon <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>The international film exhibition initiated by the Soviet Union previously solicited entries from our country and telegraphed invitations to Mr. Zhou Jianyun, manager of the Star Film Company, Ms. Hu Die, a famous actress, and representatives from the Lianhua Film Company to attend and participate. After the central government repeatedly summoned Mr. Zhou to Beijing to discuss, and selected "Empty Valley Orchid," "Sisters Flowers," "The Torrents," "Spring Silkworms," "Song of the Fishermen," "The Highway," "Bigamy," and "Woman" as entries, the first batch of delegates, including Mr. Tao Bosun from Lianhua Film Company, departed a week ago. The second batch of delegates, Mr. Zhou Jianyun and Ms. Hu Die, will also depart around the 20th, boarding a special ship with Ambassador Yan Huiqing and Mei Wan Hua. Mr. Zhou's wife, Ms. Chen Yujun, studied political economy at Waseda University in Japan and plans to accompany him to undertake research and recording work. The Star Film Company is actively preparing a large number of photos and printed materials (all with Russian translations) to bring with them.</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou's responsibilities at the Star Film Company are extremely heavy. This time, he is taking time out to go abroad and is busy preparing. Mr. Zhou's friends, such as Pan Gongzhan, Tang Youren, Ouyang Yuqian, Chen Biling, Chen Yanbin, Pan Yousheng, Gao Zhanfei, the Soviet consul and his wife, various film trading companies, Nanyang film merchants, local and foreign theater managers, the press, the literary and art circles, and colleagues from the Star Film Company, a total of more than thirty groups, have been hosting banquets to bid farewell to Mr. and Mrs. Zhou and Ms. Hu Die, making him extremely busy.</p>
<p>This overseas expedition of our country's film industry is an unprecedented move, and its significance is very important. According to Mr. Zhou's statement, he has heavy responsibilities in the film industry and is deeply interested in film culture. Therefore, he is very willing to take the opportunity to participate in the international film exhibition to see the cultural construction of the new Soviet Union. He believes that he can learn a lot from others, and the spirit of the Russians' hard work is also worthy of our emulation.</p>
<p>Taking the opportunity to attend the Soviet International Film Exhibition, Mr. Zhou also plans to conduct a detailed inspection of the film industry. He has drafted the following outline for the inspection: (1) The Soviet Union's current film administrative management agency, organizational system, film censorship tax rules, import procedures, etc., (2) The current situation of the film industry, (3) Film schools, (4) Construction and equipment of film studios, (5) Movie theaters, (6) Music and drama, (7) Books and magazines related to film, (8) Whether there is a market for Chinese films, (9) The Soviet Union's impressions and criticisms of Chinese entries, (10) Overseas Chinese opinions on domestic films, (11) The proceedings of the Soviet International Film Exhibition, (12) Other.</p>
<p>It is also heard that if time permits, Mr. Zhou and others also intend to travel to Germany, France, and Italy to see the industries of Berlin and the ancient sites of Rome.</p>

<p>— Lin Qin</p>
<p>(1)</p>
<p>In 1935, film songs were very popular. Sound was inserted, and silent films were dubbed. Almost every film had "songs," and every film was "dubbed"!</p>
<p>(2)</p>
<p>Playwrights may have a way out, because some directors have abandoned "writing and directing themselves"!</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>The film title must be extremely modern, and the content can be extremely outdated. This can achieve unparalleled effectiveness in advertising.</p>

<p>— Qi Guan</p>
<p>The advertisement for RKO Pictures, the three letters R.K.O., are 67 feet high on top of Pifreri Mountain in Hollywood, and each letter is 40 feet wide. The electricity bill costs hundreds of dollars per month. There are iron ladders on each letter. Someone previously climbed up the iron ladder and jumped to commit suicide. Now, people are assigned to guard them day and night.</p>
<p>MGM has 2,000 pieces of transportation equipment, including light trains, automobiles, carriages, oxcarts, sedan chairs, airplanes, and 50 specially made armored large cars.</p>
<p>Universal Pictures covers more than 600 acres, with mountains, rivers, and wilderness. There are shops inside, and a huge hospital, where people in the film industry often stay for treatment.</p>
<p>In Europe, Ufa Film Company in Germany is the largest, with more than 1,000 acres of land. There are small electric trains to pick up and drop off people from the gate to the internal offices. If you walk around the Ufa Company, it would take 20 hours to complete the entire film studio!</p>
<p>Fox Movietone City is like a small city, divided into ten areas. The distribution of electricity uses 70 miles of underground tunnels to connect the power lines, which is almost as complex as the electrical distribution in New York City.</p>
<p>Warner Brothers-First National's film studio has 50 huge buildings, covering 90 acres. The offices cover 50 acres, and there is also a huge square, with mountains and rivers, covering more than 800 acres. After First National Pictures merged into Warner Brothers in 1928, more than 200 acres of huge buildings were added.</p>
<p>There are more than 700 mountains in California, USA, and half of them are occupied by Hollywood film companies, preparing for filming.</p>
<p>Seventeen islands around San Francisco all have offices of various Hollywood film companies, and are registered as film-specific land.</p>
<p>If Hollywood's film industry were to stop, the market in the entire state of California would probably decline as a result.</p>

<p>— Xuemei</p>
<p>After Johnny Ramirez finished speaking, the leader of the five men spoke: "Charlie, did you say these words, or did this guy say them? Why can't you speak for yourself, and you have to let someone else speak for you? Are you kidding us in front of us? We bought that piece of land, and you'll regret it." Before Charlie could speak, Johnny interjected, "Of course you're not kidding. We also hope you don't joke. Because if you want to buy that piece of land, you'll have to buy it from us." The man said, "I don't understand what you're saying." Johnny said, "What I'm saying is that we have the right of first refusal to buy that land. You need to know that we knew your trick months ago and have been prepared."</p>
<p>After Johnny finished speaking, he walked out, still smiling. The men sat there without saying a word. Finally, one person said, "Where did you hire this person from?" Charlie Roque had already recovered and said with a smile, "Really smart, isn't he? Friends, let me tell you, this is my secret: to be able to use people, to have smart people come to me. He came to me six months ago, originally extremely bored, looking for work. He met Bu Qu'ande Luosi, my boxer, a wild bull with immense strength. Bu Qu'ande Luosi asked him, 'Fool, what can you do?' Johnny said calmly, 'Idiot, what can you do, what can I do?' Bu Qu'ande Luosi heard this and roared like a lion, rushing towards Johnny. That's all Bu Qu'ande Luosi could remember, I'm afraid... By the time he woke up leisurely an hour later, his nose was bent, and his position was gone."</p>
<p>The man said, "Did you chase Bu Qu'ande Luosi away?" Charlie said, "Of course, what I like most is the victor." He paused and said, "What are we doing sitting here? Why don't you go outside for a drink?" So they went outside, under the colorful lights, the gambling tables were noisy, and the sound of money clanking. Charlie Roque couldn't help but be happy. At this time, Roque's wife, Mary Roque, was walking in from outside. His wife, Mary Roque, was the most fashionable woman in Mexicali. Her hair was golden. Her figure was sensual, with curves. She also had a pair of arrogant and seductive eyes.</p>
<p>Roque saw her come in and hurried to greet her, saying, "Honey, why did you come here?" Mary replied listlessly, "Do you find it strange?" Her beautiful eyes glanced at Johnny Ramirez. Roque said, "It's not strange, but my little sister, I don't like you coming to this kind of place. You know, this is not a place for women." His little sister said, "I can't stay at home all day and all night. I also want to go out and have some fun. What can I do at home? Feed the goldfish? But the goldfish only eat once a day..." Roque said with a smile, "Be good, don't make a fuss, go home quickly... I'll be back earlier today." He turned his head and shouted to Johnny, "Johnny, take the wife home."</p>
<p>So Johnny accompanied the boss's wife out, walking between many wine tables. They walked out the door. Johnny opened the door for her without saying a word. They walked to the street. Mary hooked her arms around Johnny's neck and kissed him. A very quick and passionate kiss. After she kissed him, she jumped into the car and drove away laughing. Johnny stood dumbly on the side of the road. He couldn't help but feel something, but he had to be careful. He didn't have to get involved with Mary Roque because he had more important things to do tonight. (To be continued)</p>
