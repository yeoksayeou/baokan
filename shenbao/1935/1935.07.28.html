<p>— 年</p>
<p>昨日本報天津專電。傳華北中日經濟提携之事。已由雙方在津開會討論。參與討論者。除中日銀行家實業家外。中國有市政府方面。日本有駐屯軍及大使館領事館方面之官員。暄傳已久之華北中日經濟提携問題。至此由醞釀而漸臻於實行之階段。敢以所見。向雙方參與討論諸君一言之。　此次兩國在華北之經濟提携。爲由軍事的及政治的飛勢所造成。此不容諱言。亦不必諱言者。今其事旣有不得不實現之趨勢。且由雙方作雍容之討論。則稍稍挽回局勢。使其間得存留互利之因素。實國人在無可如何之情形下所應有之希望也。夫經濟提携之一名詞。在此次討論中所具有之特別意義如何。姑置弗論。若就普通涵義解釋之。則固爲表示平等互惠之行動老。雙方參與討論諸君。倘能就事論事。依此名詞之普通解釋。作爲進行之標準。其利益不僅屬於被開發之方面。卽以巨資相投之一方。亦有無窮希望。記者非不知此次討論以前日本關東軍方面之如何决策。及事伴進行之主動者及其方針之若何。特是事態轉移。在形式上旣已屬於經濟問題之討論。其討論重心所在。依正當觀察方法。自不能不認爲「日本準備以巨額資本。投入中國冀察等省地方。而共謀安全適當之處置」者也。日本此項投資之方法。或爲借欵。或爲合辦。須待討論决定。今尙難言。而一言安全適當。則非完全拋却以前所以造成此提携之方法。而於平等互惠之條件中尋求之不可。若以武力及國際政治力量爲投資之基礎。其基礎已非安全適當。更何用作討論乎。此次出席之日本銀行家實業家。不乏眼光遠大之人。倘能超越環境。發抒卓見。則討論結果或可不違於經濟提携之正義。而獲得安全適當之途徑乎。至若中國出席諸君。記者希望其堅持平等互惠之原則。審愼應付。討論務以單純的經濟開發爲範圍。方案務以實際施行時無損於國家主權人民生活爲標準。衡量雙方之利害。勿失最後之立塲。蓋此次旣開會討論。則依常理言。已成爲對方投資華北。推銷商品。我則利用外資。以開發地方經濟之事件。至少得失相當之原則。殊不可不堅守之也。</p>
<p>中日間情勢。已使華北之經濟提携不得不進行。在提携進行之中。勿更鑄錯。是爲要義。茲以根本之點。向雙方出席諸君縷析言之。至細目之討論。則以勿違此根本要點爲準。庶可言經濟提携乎。</p>

<p>阿京阿比西尼亞皇帝頃向報界發表宣言、其中指陳兩點、（一）阿比西尼亞政府抱定决心、當力求和平解决意阿爭端（二）意阿兩國衝突、主要原因係由於兩國政府對於一九零八年五月十六日所簽訂勘定阿國與意屬索謀里蘭疆界之條約、解釋不同、至於目前、意國在原則上雖接受提交仲裁、然在事實上、則以種種手叚、使仲裁無法進行、意國旣否認仲裁委員會有權解釋華爾華爾領士之屬何方、佔領華爾華爾地方之是否合法、又拒絕由國聯會行政院指派第五中立仲裁委員、如是則仲裁程序、安有進行之可能乎、總之、國聯會會員國中、公然侵犯他國之主權、與獨立者究係何國、利用武力以作向外發展之政治工具者究係何國、此二者、今當由國聯會行政院决定之、吾人現以十分信任之心、盼待行政院之决定云、（二十七日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>華隊技術頗佳惜少經騐結果下比敗得有面子</p>
<p>今日中華對紡織　中華棒球隊蝗日與美僑業餘隊、交鋒於中國、此為上海棒球聯賽之第一聲、亦中華隊第一次顯其身手、業餘久經沙塲之隊伍、新近成軍之中華固非其敵、但表運尙有可觀、惜平時未經比賽、臨塲慌張、陣容不嚴、結果以一比十失收、今日中華對上海紡織、下午三時乃在　　、</p>
<p>局勢平衡　中華先攻開始、金驂放出一壘安打、惜盜至三壘被殺、業餘赫勃納上塲即受一振而下、拉萊中投手之球、球復遠逸、乃得　分、幸以後吃堅防禦、以華特雖得安打而無效、　一局中華賀瓊華先得安打登壘、雷英吃三振、黄源發得機上壘、　咸亦創安打、助黄得一分、但賀走壘被殺、曾瑞琪亦吃　振、中華計得　安打、獲一分、業餘乘中華接</p>
<p>功虧一簣　三　　、中華聲勢極盛、曾瑞康中投手之球得壘、黄源發胡和忠均出安打、但曾盜壘不愼被殺、賀瓊華四球得壘、若竹不被殺、即可得分、斯時中華選手、滿佈壘、仍有機會、惜後繼無功、雷英三振下場、功虧一簣、業餘輪攻、中華佈陣不嚴、動作遲呆、更以失誤疊出、使業餘　得四分之多、中華乃大傷原氣、計以一比六負、</p>
<p>堅持奮鬥　　四局上、中華曾氏昆伸　出安打、但無功而下、斯時中華頗露慌張之態、甘咸投球、亦失標的、竟送出五次四球數之多、予業餘無安打而得四分之多、中華竟此挫折、力事鎭靜、以後四局、竟使業餘毫無建樹、而第八局一、甘咸創一名責之　壘打、送雷英回壘、再一分、第九局業餘　權、結果遂以二比十歸業餘勝利、各局比數如下、中華〇一〇〇〇〇〇〇一二分</p>

<p>日本四大學網球選手隊平井等四人、昨日下午在法商總會球塲、出傷作第一次之表演、單打二組、雙打一組、皆爲日選手所勝、惟覜衆並不如意料之多、僅四五百人之數、精彩亦偶或有之而已、比賽之結果如下、</p>
<p>四人球藝　四人之中、可觀者爲平井、據謂平井列全日第一一、其擊法確甚淸晰敏捷，正反手抽擊、異常純熟、反手與正手同俱魄力、令日與邱飛海、必有　戰、林氏列全日　九、其藝平平而已、反手旣無把握、全仗底綫之止手一抽、藝在史規亞輩之間、雙打尙可觀、網上工夫甚佳、殺球半空　等但有造就、今日與德孚組大可戰、</p>
<p>林史之戰　史規亞處處較林氏爲一佳、　法亦甚聰明七妙、其敗非林敗之、自殺也、第</p>
<p>盤史以四比三佔先、林運勝二局、但但　爲史連下局得勝、第一盤史又連勝二局、大有一瀉千里之槪、不料因錯誤太多、爲林直下六局、第三盤史又以三比一佔先、但又爲林以六比四反勝、史之擊法、巳大進步、體乎尙欠把　、否則擊收林氏、實爲易事、</p>
<p>雙打惜敗　林邱雙打之收、對方並不見如何特出、但邱　海之减色、球出無管束力、連連出界、殺又無力、合作又疎、林寳華孤掌難嗚、竟一籌莫展、第一盤各勝發球局、曾以七比六佔先、不料連失三局、第二盤不堪收拾、</p>
<p>平井登塲　爲時已晏、觀衆紛離、匆匆結束、須藤表演極佳、平井幾爲所累、第一盤三比三、五比五、成七比五、第二盤　比二、四比三、成六比四、極盡緊張之至、</p>

<p>— 君朋</p>
<p>小朋友呀！現在用武的時候到了！大家快些下一個總動員令吧！看看報紙的小朋友，總該曉得，上海市强迫識敎，在七月一日已開始了。雖有六萬餘文盲，踴躍入學，你想中國有百分之八十以上，不識字的人，這樣就算敎育普及嗎？</p>
<p>識字是求智識的工具，智識是開發一切事業的原動力。一國的强弱，在乎人民智識的高下，欲求智識的高，只有普及敎育，現在要救那岌岌可危的祖國，全在此舉。所以要請諸位小朋友，以誠摯之心，去敎不識字的人識字。</p>
<p>小朋友呀！你不要以爲我們年紀小，沒有多大能力，但你要知道，我們是這個運動中的有力戰士！我們敎人識字，眞是不費吹灰之力，只要把逐日老師敎給你的字，一個一個敎給不識字的人，這樣一傳十，十傳百，互相輾轉敎導，不難達到强迫識字敎育的目的。</p>
<p>全國的小朋友，在這個炎熱的暑假裏，想必沒多大的暑期作業，總可抽出一些時間，來實行「小先生」的制度，負起這個極大的使命，爲國家民族效勞，那時，「小先生」何等的光榮而可敬呵！</p>

<p>我們若是參與什麽茶話會，或是聚餐會，那些一飲一食的禮儀是不可不注意的。</p>
<p>入席的時候，要認明自己相當的座位。入席以後，一言一動，要時時照顧到同席的，不要　另另地做成一個生僻的人。也不要顯出粗魯莽撞的神氣來惹人厭惡。</p>
<p>咀嚼東西的時候，嘴巴不要張得太大。不要像牛羊吃草似地左右盤嚼。口腔裏不要滿滿地包着食物。要恰如其分的細嚼緩嚥。尤其小心東西攢到鼻腔和氣管裏，咳嗆噴嚏，最是失禮。</p>
<p>飲茶嚥飯，以輕輕地不出聲爲佳。不要嗗嘟嗗嘟地似牛羊喝水，驢馬嚙草。</p>
<p>在宴席上不要張開兩肘，侵越隣座的席面。一舉一動，都要溫文爾雅。</p>
<p>斟酒必須起立。飲酒不可過量。　酒應當徐飲。勸酒勿太勉强。</p>
<p>做客人的一飲一食，都應留幾分員。做主人的應該讓客人餐畢後，停餐，免得客人心中不安。</p>

<p>— 楚玉</p>
<p>近來天氣，一天熱一天，家家爲防遏陽光直射，都搭凉棚，蓋窗簾，可是屋內的熱度，固因房尾的大小，局圍樹木的有無，窗戶的形式等，各戶的熱度，各不相同，而且都會的暑熱，比鄉間爲其的，可是與暑熱關係最大的，實爲屋頂所蓋瓦的顏色與道路的舖塡物。爲什麽呢？太陽的熱照到房屋屋頂時，據科學家的實騐，蓋紅瓦的屋頂，吸收了百分之六七，蓋綠磚的吸收了百分之七五，塗黑色的亞鉛屋頂，吸收了百分之七七，這就是因屋頂所用材料不同與顏色差異，吸收的暑熱遂有高低了。他如屋的周圍道路與天井，其溫度亦有關係，道路的溫度，雖依地位與時間有別，大槪對於氣溫二十八度八時，其吸收的熟度如下：木煉瓦道爲四五·〇度，十瀝靑道爲四二·三度，黄砂水泥混合道爲三九·〇度，石道為三八·四度，黄砂道爲三六·〇度，照這樣看起來，經過舖的道路，反而較熱，所以在交通機關發達的今日，因社會大衆的要求，不得不有舖裝，一面爲低减暑熱，便利行人起見，路旁種植樹木，旣壯觀瞻，又可避炎熱啊。</p>

<p>樹上的蟬聲還沒有停止的時候，階前的蟋蟀却又嗚了。</p>
<p>我們都知道蟬，牠是一種優游自適的動物；在夏天，牠不做一點事務，只知道髙聲唱歌：等到天氣漸漸地冷了，牠因爲沒有預備下糧食，所以就要餓死了，但是蟋蟀卻和蟬兩樣，蟋蟀的鳴聲是很有意義的，牠是在報吿我們秋天已竟來到，不要冉乘風納凉，應該趕快努力各人的事業；並且蟋蟀是有勇氣的，逢到別人欺侮牠的時候，牠必定要奮力地抵抗，决不畏縮</p>
<p>親愛的小友們呵！當你們聽見這蟋蟀嗚聲的時候，你也想到一年將盡，應該作最後的努力嗎？並且你看見蟋蟀那樣勇敢的精神，你也預備克服自己內心的恐怖，鍜鍊自己堅強的體魄，做一個健全的小國民嗎？</p>

<p>— 寄雨</p>
<p>報紙的功用是什麽？報紙大槪有兩種功用：一種是指導人民，使人民得到各種智識，比如小朋友們天天讀報，你們的智識就會向各方面進展·一種是傳達人民的意見，所以報紙又叫做「人民的喉舌」，新聞記者被稱爲「無冕皇帝」。</p>
<p>新聞從那裏來的？新聞的來源有兩種：第一種是由報館自己的訪員或通訊員採來的，第二種是由新聞通訊社裏得來的。通訊社有官辦和商辦兩種，官辦目的在於替自己宣傅，商辦目的在於賺錢，外國通訊社在我國很多，比如像路透社，美聯社，哈瓦斯社等等，報上常可看見，我國自己的通訊社也有，像中央社，國民社，國聞社，申時社，新聲社，等都是全國自己的通訊社，爲數大約有一百六十餘個。</p>
<p>我們自己報紙的歷史怎樣？中國目前的報紙可算現在你們所讀的申報最早，刋行到現在，已經有六十餘年了，其次是新聞報，也有四十餘年了，從申報刋行以來，我們中國自己的報紙漸漸的多了，到了現在，全國登記的報紙共有四百餘種了。</p>

<p>奇怪的玻璃杯</p>
<p>科學先生帶了一隻玻璃杯和一張紙條上台了，他對台下的小朋友們說：「今天我這戲法是簡單的，同時也是有趣的。」</p>
<p>他把那張紙條放在檯邊，在杯子裏倒了半杯水，就把這杯子壓在紙條上面，說道：</p>
<p>「諸位小朋友，有誰能够不移動玻璃杯，而把紙條取到手裏？」</p>
<p>台下的小朋友都想：「紙條壓在玻璃杯下面，如果想把紙條取出，而不移動玻璃杯，那是無論如何辦不到的！」因此，沒有一個小朋友站起來說：「我會，我會。」</p>
<p>科學先生微笑說：「其實這是最容易的，你們看。」只見他很迅速很用力的把紙條一抽，玻璃杯一動也不動可是那紙條却已在他手裏了。於是台下的小朋友們一個個睜着驚奇的眼睛，在心裏讚美着科學先生戲法的簡單而有趣。</p>
<p>科學先生說：「你們知道爲什麼杯子不會動麽？原來一切靜止着的物體，不能自己動起來，檯上的銅圓，決不會自己飛至你的手裏。同時，一切動着的物體，也不能自己停止，山頂滾下來的木頭，决不會半途停住。物體的這種性質，叫做「惰性。」但是我們如果用手去拿銅元，銅元就動了；拿大石去擋往木頭，木頭就停住了；打破這種惰性的就叫做「力。」剛才我用手拍紙條，「力」只達到紙條，而沒有達到杯子，杯子的惰性沒有被打破，所以依舊一動也不動。</p>
<p>「不過，你們試騐起來，如果抽得慢，杯子就會跟着紙條動了，這是應該注意的。」</p>

<p>近來杭州民衆俱樂部爲促進兒童健康及提倡娛樂起見，特組織了一個「兒童哈哈圑」，凡年齡在八歲至十五歲以下的，都可以自由參加，該團的主要目的：規定須每日大笑三次，每星期召開團員大會，並且在規定期內，舉行哈哈大會一次，表演各種有趣技術，以增加興趣，聞說此項消息公布後，曾有某某等私立小學學生數十人，已向民衆俱樂部報名加入了。</p>
<p>諸位小朋友們！你們聽了上面消息後，有什麽戚想麽？我得吿訴你們，笑在生理方面說來：一方面可以消除煩惱，另一方面可以活潑身心，的確是延年益壽的良法，同時我們在做無論什麽事的時候，可不覺得疲乏，此外又能使一件事循着進行而不畏艱難，所以必須要模仿杭州民衆俱樂部組織的「兒童哈哈團」，或者家裏有哥弟姊妹們的，聚起來也可以組織一個類似的哈哈團，規定每日大笑三次，這不也是很有趣味的麼？</p>

<p>於是隱士召到一隻山鼠，對他說道：「娶這個少女做你的妻吧。」那鼠回答說：「我是願　的，但伊怎樣走進我的洞裏去呢！」它的話有理，隱士便說道：「那麽把伊仍然變成一隻鼠兒吧。」他用法術使伊仍然變成鼠兒，叫那雄鼠兒帶了去。</p>

<p>— 心靑</p>
<p>一千八百四十八年七月二十四日，這是克斯都石大戰的第一天，在我們的一個步兵營中，有六十名兵士受了命令，去防守近邊髙原上的一所屋子。但是他們忽地被兩隊奧大利兵所襲擊，因爲從各方面攻打過來，所以他們已來不及躱到屋子裏去堵住了門，只得撇下他們死傷的伙伴，躺在田野中。</p>
<p>那門終於守住了，堵得非常堅固，我們的兵士們疾忙趕到底層和上一層的窗子前去，向那進攻的敵人們拼命地開火抵抗，同時那些敵人正在作半圓形緩緩地進行，一面很猛烈的回擊</p>
<p>那六十名意大利兵士是山兩位中尉指揮着，而他們的統將是一位沈默而嚴肅的老大佐，他是髙髙的身材，鬢髮都巳雪白了。</p>
<p>同他們在一起的有一個沙狄尼亞的小鼓手，他是一個十四歲左右的孩子，只因身髁生得很短小，瞧去還好似十二歲的模樣，他的皮膚是橄欖色的，而　雙深凹的黑眼珠裏，似乎有火燄在燃燒着。</p>
<p>老大佐在樓上指揮着兵士們抵抗，每發一個命令，好像開手槍一般的快，他的鐵靑的臉上，很鎭靜的不動聲色。</p>
<p>那小鼓手慘白着臉，站在桌子上，雙手扶住了牆壁，探頭到窗外去，眼見得在烟霧迷漫中，奧大利兵正穿過了田野，着着進行。</p>
<p>那屋子是坐落在一座斜斜的山坡的頂上，　樓上有一扇髙髙的小窗，可以望見山頂，這一方面和山頂上都沒有奧大利兵的蹤影。他們的槍砲是向着屋子的前面和兩旁攻擊着。這一次的襲擊再猛烈沒有了，砲彈像電也似的打在牆壁上，穿過了破碎的屋頂，毀壞了天花板，粉碎了樑柱，門窗，和一切器具，空中都充滿着磗塊，木片，灰泥像雲霧一般，砟玻璃和器物擊毀的聲音，在他們的頭上鏗鏘地作響，和那可怕的槍砲聲互相應答。</p>
<p>那些在窗前抵抗的兵士們，不時的中槍跌倒下來，便立刻有人將他拖在一旁，別的兵士們在一間間房中往來奔跑，將他們的手掩住了身上正在流血的傷口。在廚房中躺着一個兵士，槍彈已洞穿了他的頭額。敵人們在不住的包圍上來。那沈默而嚴肅的老大佐，到此才現出不安定的模樣兒來，從房中趕將出去，有一個軍曹跟着他。一會兒，那軍曹又趕回來了，喚那小鼓手跟他同去。</p>

<p>— 珍妮</p>
<p>本月二十一日大晚報星期評論中有：「不嫁有婦夫」的短評一則，是批評本刊上期筆者的「法律與婦女」一文的。雖屬謙論高見，然筆者却不敢苟同。用特再伸鄙意如下：「大晚報短評原文附錄於右讀者可參照）</p>
<p>第一·記得筆者前文，明明是說「在封建的男權社會裏，一個有權勢的公子少爺，可以擁有三妻四妾，社會為之歌頌宣揚，法律則多方為之保證，現今時代雖已變遷……」而我們的批評家，却斷章取義，輕輕地將「在封建的男權社會裏」一句鈎去，而剝奪了筆者這幾句話的時間性。誰都知道過去的封建社會裏，一個公子少爺擁有三妻四妾，社會上都譽為艷福美舉，坊間的什麼九美圖十美圖以及一切傳奇說部，十九描寫一個風流才子，左抱右擁，有如粉蝶穿花等故事。凡此種種，不是社會「為之歌頌宣揚」嗎？而且有許多地方，認為一個有錢人的家裡，沒有幾個姨太太是一樁不體面的事情。所以謂為「社會為之歌頌宣揚」實在並未「言之過火」。至於言法律，我國在無法令律規之前，一切的史乘經典上，都明明地寫着一夫有多妻的文字：「曲禮」有：「買妾不知其姓，則卜之」之句。公羊傳載：「諸侯一娶九女，天子一娶十二女」。秦始皇時更有所謂「宮中夫人之下，設美人，良人，八子，七子，長使，少使，」等名目。至漢武帝時，更添婕妤，昭儀等名目，共分十四等。仲長統說：「公侯之宮，美女數百，鄉士之家，侍妾數十」，這些都是眞憑實據，用不着我們為古人掩護。及至律例施行，宗祧繼承法，以及「承認妾為家族之一員」等的規定，法律上確是明明在保護一夫多妻。所以說：「法律多方為之保護，也未言之過火」吧！</p>
<p>自民國二十年宗祧繼承法廢置，以至最近頒佈的新刑法，我國法律之關係於婦女部分的，確有相當的改進。然而在現社會下，所謂「社會的觀感」，何嘗能代表一般社會的觀感？</p>
<p>第二·新刑法第二三九條誠為告訴乃論之罪，如配偶從容或宥恕者，並不得告訴，如公子少爺另結新歡，倘其原配，不為告訴，這工資少爺，仍屬無罪；換句話說，有這條法律。而女子不會用，不用，不願用，這不是法律無效，而是女子自甘放棄。然而按諸一般的情理，除非她是白痴，殘廢，或病狂者外，决不會從容配偶去和人通姦甚至結婚的。站在婚姻自由的立場上講，一方旣有新歡，另一方當然用不着再專留戀，何況性愛生活總是帶有排他性的，明知丈夫有新歡，仍要留戀——美其名曰從容或宥恕，做「掛名夫妻」，當有不得已的苦衷在！當一般婦女，尚以結婚為終身養老院的現在，若使丈夫坐牢，不啻自己封鎖或打破自己的飯碗，所以與其稱快洩憤於一時，不如含垢忍辱於來日。同時即使能告訴。若對方（丈夫）是權勢者之流，法律也會無如之何！此種事實，只要不會「掩耳」，總不會「無聞」吧！</p>
<p>第三：誠然，有許多趨炎附勢的婦女，歡喜權勢兒郎，或多金老翁，不惜為「虛榮而作無價值的犧牲」。但在披上資本主義化的外衣，而內部則封建殘餘依舊，經濟組織破敗不堪的現社會下，一般女子，旣不能獨立營生，自然只有依賴男子之一途，而奢侈社會的對於她的誘惑，使她們趨向虛榮，已是一般資本主義社會應有的通病。所以虛榮是有它的經濟上的根源，决不是婦女的自勉自勵所能醫治的。何况當此大部分的婦女，簡直是商品，可任人買賣，權勢者以萬能的金錢，泰山似的勢力，來買取一個商品似的弱女子，可不费吹灰之力，所謂「此類事情，自能滅絕」誰敢相信？</p>
<p>當然我們相信，「此類事情，總有一天會滅絕」。但至少需等到人與人之間，眞正一律平等自由之時才能實現。</p>
<p>那時的法律才是為保護一般人的利益的法律。所以我們並不蔑視法律，只是我們應該看透現在法律尤其現在的法律與婦女的關係。社會學者倍倍爾說：「一國的法律，是支配階級的有利的組織的表現，婦女是被壓的服從的「性」，所以她們在法律的地位，也是如此，法律是消極的，也是積極的，當分配權利的時候，對於被壓迫者毫不注意，這是消極的，在指摘被壓迫的服從地位及為自己的便利而指定各種例外時，是積極的。」（見婦人與社會四三一頁），這幾句話，很明白地告訴了我們：不平等社會下的法律，在權勢和被壓迫者中的關係，尤其對於婦女的關係。</p>
<p>總之：若認為現時的一切法律與社會觀感已决不會因權勢而變更，以及男女間的不平等，只要婦女界的自勉自勵，就可達到目的，祗不是不明社會的底細，就是有意歪曲事實。</p>

<p>今日申報「婦女園地」週刊，載着一篇題為「法律與婦女」的評論，作者為珍妮書。</p>
<p>這篇文章的內容，有兩點引起我的疑義。第一，作者說：「一個有權勢的公子少爺，可以擁有三妻四妾，社會為之歌頌宣揚。法律則多方為之保護。」這幾句話未免言之過火而不切實情，藎多妻制度，不但吾國法律無明文為之保護，即在現在情勢之下，亦每為社會所詬病，當非因公子少爺的關係，可以變更社會的觀感和法律的規定。第二，新刑法第二三九條：「有配偶而與人通姦者，處一年以下有期徒刑…」的規定，為告訴乃論之罪，且如配偶從容或宥恕者，並不得告訴，故公子少爺另結新歡，倘其原配不為告訴，便認為這條新法律試驗失敗，我們實未敢謂然。</p>
<p>總之，我們所希望於婦女界者，即在婦女本身的自勉與自勵，抱定「不嫁有婦之夫」的宗旨，則此類事情，自能滅絕，否則因一時的虛榮，不但其犧牲為沒有價值，且更暴露了婦女的弱點。</p>

<h3 id="c208">第五節　賣淫與販賣婦女 <a href="#c208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— 君慧</p>
<p>賣淫原不是資本主義社會所獨有的現象。在奴隸經濟時代及封建時代也會有過大規模的賣淫制度。不過，到了資本主義時代，牠更獲得了普遍發展的社會基礎。</p>
<p>資本主義是把婦女的肉體變化成市塲上主要的一種商品，使她從屬於像燻肉，橡皮，棉花等一般的商品流通的法則。一方面在「神聖的」一夫一妻制底下得不到結婚的滿足的人們以及廣大的強制的獨身生活者——如軍人，學生，工人等——都需要滿足瞬間的享樂，而不負任何責任的婦女的肉體，同時，在他方面，零落的貴族婦女，破產的農婦以及失業的女工們，迫於飢寒而不能不出賣肉體，她們經由種種經紀人之手集中於資本主義的賣淫企業，由此，很正確的實行需要和供給的流通過程。這樣，遂形成了資本主義社會的「人肉市塲」。</p>
<p>在資本主義社會，因為賣淫企業的利潤格外雄厚，所以，唯利是圖的商人們用種種方法販賣婦女及經營淫業，他們一方面收買年輕貌美的「搖錢樹」，他方面招攬肯出錢的顧客。在公開的妓樓，茶館，戲塲，舞廳等地方，公然或隱然地實行人肉買賣。這裡有高官大爵，法官及政客，紳士及軍人，甚至廢娼運動的中堅人物也成為她們的顧客。</p>
<p>關於賣淫的資本主義的企業形態，「歐洲的賣淫」的著者普列克乃爾」教授是提供了很有趣的資料，他先指出生活商品的貿易途徑：「賣淫婦大部分由匃牙利，加里西亞，波蘭及羅馬尼亞輸出，而運到巴西，阿根廷，南美及小亞西亞各國。」他又說：「在布達白斯特，要開辦最新的妓樓，則需要五十萬克羅乃的資本。在巴黎第二流賣淫企業的年收益，達於七萬法郎，柏林最新經營的一個妓樓，擁有一百萬馬克的資本，據說在一九一二年分得二成的紅利」。</p>
<p>這樣，在資本主義社會，賣淫是「一本萬利」的企業，而且這種企業對於國家財政上也有相當的幫助。幾月前廣東佛山妓女要免納花捐的所謂「月經風潮」的記憶，還留在我們的腦際。這所謂「花捐」，各國同樣，都是從妓女身上剝削而充實國庫的東西。因此，國家一方面有保護納稅者的賣淫業的責任。他方面，因為「人肉市塲」是過於暴露這文明社會的醜惡面，所以，他們常常用道德的「面紗」來把牠掩蔽，他們或發政令，禁遏賣淫行為，或發起大眾的廢娼運動而要把牠撤廢。但這好像唐吉訶得和風車搏　一樣，終於失敗，他們愈要掩蔽，醜態遍愈見暴露。</p>
<p>本來婦女肉體的商品化，是和人的勞動力的商品化，屬於同一範疇。在「勞動市塲」存在着的社會，所謂「人肉市塲」也必然跟着存在。假使婦女出賣肉體是不正當的話，則工人的出賣血汗也是不正當的！不過，在支配层的人們看來，這種活商品的公然流通，不單「有礙觀瞻，」而且「大傷風化」，於是想出種種禁壓方法來粉飾社會的道德門面。</p>
<p>可是當他們無法掩蔽這醜惡的社會相的時候，他們便退而尋找使賣淫制度合理化的理論根據。但這個根據，却也在婦女身上找到了！德國的著名衛生學者羅薄那博士，是如下的說明賣淫制度的必然性與永續性：</p>
<p>「婦女的賣淫，在任何民族，任何時代都有，這是不能廢棄的。因為這種制度，於性交有效，而且發源於人的本性。賣淫動機，大都是由於婦女天賦的弱點，好像在民族中有天才痴子，巨人倭人和一般中庸人不同一樣，因為造化的惡戲，生出了非賣淫不可異常者。（婦人與社會）</p>
<p>這是很顯然的，要將社會的醜惡行為的責任加在婦女身上，而使利潤　厚的賣淫企業作為合理的存在的一種企圖。同時，這就是所有保衛這個社會的人們的一貫見解。</p>
<p>在我們看來，賣淫這一現象，並不是在這世界上出現婦女時便已存在。雖則在聖經上說夏娃是誘惑男子的魔鬼，但在共同生產，共用消費的原始母權社會，婦女並不見得有「天賦的弱點」，更沒有賣淫制度。祗是到了大多數人從事生產，少數人專事消費的男權時代賣淫才被發見出來。但這種社會的惡得的責任，我們絕不願推在男子身上，而應當推在不合理的社會制度上面。</p>
<p>總而言之，賣淫制度是在有產者和男權支配着的社會裏必然產生的東西。因此，在有產者社會堆內，發起所謂廢娼運動而企圖把牠消滅，那祗是虛幻的夢想，我們相信，賣淫並不基因於什麼人牲和婦女的弱點，也不是什麼「與天地長存」的東西。到了無論男女不勞動便不准吃飯的社會，即好像原始母權時代那樣大家生產，大家消費的社會，賣淫制度也和其他一切不合理的制度同歸消滅，是可以斷言的！</p>

<p>——她嗎？她是什麼東西都想從我這裏拿些去的。這一樣，「媽！給了我」。那一樣，「媽！給了我」。我告訴你，她想把我的一架花車也要拿去呢」。指着門跟前的一部紡紗車，接着又說：「果然她也命生得苦，你姊夫本來替人家幇工的，去年生了黃　病，到現在還沒有好，一家子就靠你姊姊抓爬來活命，幸虧她大女兒長大了，今年已有十三歲，她說晚上小弟妹們睡覺了，可以呌大女兒給人家紡防沙，也可賺幾個錢」。</p>
<p>修珍把身體向被突裏縮進些。</p>
<p>母親開始脫衣服，也坐進被洞，在衣襟中摸蝨子。</p>
<p>間壁嫂嫂忽然打起小孩來，地板鼕鼕地響，又罵着：</p>
<p>——你這小鬼呀，又撒出水，你曉得這樣冷的天氣，濕了被頭叫我們怎麼睡」。</p>
<p>——婆婆！婆婆呀！我痛死啦」！小孩尖利的呌。</p>
<p>——別再打啦，已經撒出了，還打什麼呢」。母親高聲地說。</p>
<p>——你不要來插嘴，我不打他，下次還會撒出的。你下次撒不撒啦？你說」！嫂嫂恨恨地說。接着又是鞭打聲。</p>
<p>——你說，你說「我下次不撒啦說。」啦就會不打你」。母親教大孫兒。</p>
<p>一陣打罵聲過去，似乎那孩子已說了不是。一時又靜寂下來。</p>
<p>燈火很小了，油差不多燒乾。母親在平時要是不做事，當入睡時，就把燈火吹滅，現在為了女兒，她重新起床，把燈草再撥起些，又加了些油。</p>
<p>——油眞貴」。母親說：「從前一百錢有好些日子可以點，現在沒有幾天就燒光了。我愈儉省。牠却愈燒完得快，有時我竟黑摸着上床呢」！她把帳門放下，驚動得老鼠忙在帳頂上亂跑，伏在床脚下的貓驚覺了向上直躍，老鼠吱吱地呌。</p>
<p>——怎麼還養貓着貓」？修珍問。</p>
<p>——那裏可以不養呢，老鼠多少可惡，每件東西都咬得粉碎」。母親忽然笑起來。「我的貓很乖呢？牠每天總是拖幾隻老鼠，用不着喂飯」。說到飯，就聯想到米了。「米依舊是這麼貴！二角錢買不到一升米。……唔，我們太吃苦了，你哥哥老是找不到事情做，連信也沒一封寄回來，又不知人的着落」。</p>
<p>——嫂嫂怎麼挨呢」？修珍問。</p>
<p>——慢慢你總會知道的，今天可以睏了」。</p>
<p>母親脫掉棉衣，慢慢躺倒進被窩；合緊着嘴，好似安適地睡去了。</p>
<p>可是修珍還是張着眼，腦子裏好像有一個蟲在爬動，清晰地聽着更夫敲三更。</p>
<p>（三）</p>
<p>母親坐在廊下晒太陽，她的小脚擱着「老虎頭」（以黃泥塑成的籃，裏面可以盛炭火。窮的鄕人大都以此物取暖）。嘴不住地念佛。修珍坐在母親的旁邊，兩手供着，像猴子一樣。</p>
<p>嫂嫂一手抱了一週歲多的小孩，一手携了五六歲模樣的大兒子，腋下還挾了一大捆尿布，拖泥帶水的跑出來，把孩子放到母親的旁邊，尿布一塊塊的搭上竹竿。</p>
<p>還有一個孩子却在裏面突然呌喊着：「媽！我要起來啦！媽！……」</p>
<p>嫂嫂一邊把竹竿移到太陽照着的地方，一邊燥急地罵：</p>
<p>——小鬼頭，我剛才要把你穿衣起床，你說不要，我現在忙着做事，你却要起身了。小鬼頭，我那裏來的工夫！中飯米還沒去借呢！小鬼，老是喊，不窮也要給你喊窮啦。</p>
<p>母親放下念珠，急忙地跑進去，連聲說：「囡囡！婆婆給你穿衣，你不要哭，跟着婆婆晒太陽去。」</p>
<p>王家少奶奶和她的丫頭也抬出小桌子來，預備在太陽底下做銀錠。嫂嫂轉換了笑容，拉出幾句客套說：</p>
<p>——王少奶奶！你眞會做，這樣冷的天氣還做銀錠。</p>
<p>——不做要來不及哩，明天已是月末，一到二十外，就沒有工夫做了；這幾天開點……</p>
<p>——唔！王少奶奶！嫂嫂把頭靠進王少奶奶的耳朶，聲音放低了說：「你借我二升米。」</p>
<p>——我那裡有多的米，今年租米只換了一半，明年當然自己還吃不夠。」（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c212">人才教育論 <a href="#c212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— 易人</p>
<p>有人說，中國今日教育之病，患在教育之不普及，故民智既無由提高，一切公民的訓練無由實施，生產技術無由改良，民生經濟亦無由發展，而民族觀念世界眼光尤無由建立。故普及教育或強迫教育之倡導實為今後教育所趨的標的，這差不多是天經地義，沒有可以反駁的餘地了。但默察近代世界政治趨勢，國之強盛，一方面固由於一般人民知識的提高，可是一方面亦賴有傑出領袖人才的宏籌碩劃，這就是說，「權」與「能」之為用須並行而不悖，俾相得而益彰，而後國家始可有治的希望。</p>
<p>基此論點，我們可以知道普及教育乃所以提高一般民智，不能不注全力以促其成；而普及教育之外，亦須同時注力於人才教育。人才教育乃所以造就國家的幹才，國家須有好政治家之處理政事，科學家之創造發明，及教育家文學家實業家等各各站在社會的前鋒，才能領導全國人民走上康莊大道。故曰：人才教育運動與普及教育運動，實宜並重而不宜偏廢者也！</p>
<p>現今得受大學教育的青年或身在國外鍍金的準博士，是否卽吾人所說的國家的幹才呢？這我想怕不會有人敢下斷語的吧！老實說，今日的得受高等教育者，百分之九十九以上是資產階級的子弟雖，不乏致力學問的好青年，但也不敢說必無靠了父兄的餘蔭鬼混胡鬧的。至於一般貧寒子弟，他們大都是沒有可供高等教育甚至中等教育的經濟能力，然而這中間難道沒有比受了高等教育的資產階級子弟更聰穎更自愛更努力更有希望的人才嗎？在山村農舍中正不知有多少國家的幹才如虫豸一樣的浮沉着呢！人才湮没，不獨一己一家的損失，抑且為社會人羣莫大的損失，言之曷勝惋惜。</p>
<p>今日，國難日亟，救國的幹才尤戚不足，人才的培養尤不容或緩。且，普及教育雖為立國之大計，然成效尚在將來，今日惟有從速厲行急救的人才教育，甄援堪為國器之青年，則十年之內，國家前途或賴此得有起死回生的機會亦未可知！</p>
<p>人才教育在政治上的意義旣如上述，卽以教育本身講，以我國國民經濟力非常薄弱的國家，不去造就為國用的人才，而徒然製造幾個高等的消費者甚至專事推銷洋貨間接促國運於危亡的遊民，這卽使不是教育效率的浪費，也必負遺諛國事的重罪！</p>
<p>故吾人主張今日的大學教育，不但要整頓其內容，抑且要整齊其份子。在需材孔急的時候，不能再容少數公子小姐們把牠作為混資格騙文憑的工具了。須知今日的高等教育，卽是造就現階段中負責最重的救國幹部人才之所，多一個混蛋，卽少一隻救國的手臂，也卽少一分救國的力量。在這危急存亡之秋，吾人尚能依然故我的敷衍粉飾了事嗎？</p>
<p>至於集中和甄援人才的方法，我主張就各省中學學業品行體格毅力諸條件俱臻上乘的畢業學生中，再行一次具體的測驗（須有較可靠的標準，如智力測驗，體格檢查，思想測驗等），甄選上材，淘汰其次（小學升中學亦然），一經錄取，如無經濟能力，旣予以免費或貸金辦法。這可以說是國家的投資，將來只要能產生一個華盛頓或其他偉大的人物，能為國家為人羣謀福利，則所得的利潤必能償資本之所出而有餘。</p>
<p>我不反對普及教育，反之，我還絕對的承認惟有普及全民教育才能置國家的命運於磐石之上，但同時我又堅決地主張為救國的必需起見，非亟亟從事於人才的甄援和教育不可！</p>

<h3 id="c213">領菸酒牌照 <a href="#c213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— 楊華</p>
<p>大概前年吧，一位名利場中的朋友X君榮任了×××菸酒稅稽徽分局長；幕賓中缺少一位「能員」，挽我暫為署理內務。我對於稅收本屬「外行」，同時更非能員，惴惴焉不敢輕就。但是轉而一想：經驗是學習得來的，有什麼要緊呢？於是我就踏進稅收機關做起公務員來了！</p>
<p>接任前，X君囑我到省局代領菸酒牌照，完稅證等物，並告訴我：小工討喜錢，可以酌量給與。我認為這是很尋常的事，最多不過像在學校領講義一樣，有什麼希罕呢！</p>
<p>到了省局傳達室，我摸出X君和我的名片交給傳達，說是要會總務科長領取東西。傳達有兩個，一胖一瘦，都不約而同的隨便瞧了我一眼，大半天後由鼻子裏哼出一句：「總務科長不容易會。」我馬上就反問：「因為公事，怎麼不容易會？」那胖的睬也不睬的便做自己的事去了，祗有瘦的還拿着名片，做出要講話而又不講話的樣子。我覺得起先太小看他倆了，於是裝了一副笑臉，很客氣的向他說我是X君派來的，諸事都希望幫忙。他的臉色漸變和藹，祗問X局長為什麼不親來。當時我等於觸動了　機，明白了他倆的心理，很大方的說：「我就能夠代表X局長，二位幫了忙，當然要請吃茶的。……」</p>
<p>我的話還沒有說完，那胖的馬上轉過臉來：「好說，好說，X代表的事，我倆是應該效力的，我看X代表都是老公事，這次到局上去定很重要。」</p>
<p>我當時也樂得吹一吹：「這倒不敢。不過X局長同我是自小的朋友，歷來我做的事體都比他好，這次他無論如何要我去幫忙，眞難為情！……」</p>
<p>他倆聽得比我說的還要舒服，瘦的趕快遞給我一支「公司牌」：「這烟不好，委屈代表一下！」</p>
<p>我吸完烟，從身上摸出兩張伍元票放在收發桌上，同時還申明祗是一杯茶錢，將來還有補敬。他倆的嘴巴滿蠻着：不要！不要！一面手摸起鈔票塞進袋裏去了。最後十分謙恭的說：「我倆本不敢收代表的錢，但是辜負了盛意，又未免失禮。」隨又做個很誠懇的態度問：「代表今天預備那幾處的開消？」</p>
<p>他這一問眞把我問住了，這種公門中的道理原就不懂，</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>兼之這領取牌照等東西也用不着預備開消。我祇含糊的答應，說是切實能够帮忙的朋友纔有開消。那胖的把頭一搖說：「不對！不對！我們省局一年很難放出去幾個局長，有許多像我們這樣的人都沒薪水，子容易望着一個新局長，纔　得一點　錢，况且×局長這次又是好缺，他們怎會滑過呢？」</p>
<p>這話自然另有作用，不過却有道理，覺得他倆如果串通許多人來包圍，那就難於應付了。於是我又申明等東西領得後，還要補敬一點茶錢，同時又故意問他倆應該怎樣辦。胖的仍是把頭搖一搖的，似乎感覺十分爲難的樣子：「我看離錢不行。你想這事我倆怎好帮</p>
<p>那瘦的想了半天，纔皺着眉頭向胖的說：「胖哥，我看這事我倆弟兄担任了就是，好在×代表不是外人，將來總能够照顧你我。」</p>
<p>「你說得這麽容易呵！担任，我還不想担任？這是錢……。」</p>
<p>「對了。就是錢討厭！」瘦的隨又轉頭向我，「代表，我看還是拿點錢出來吧，這些人無非想點錢，你代表帮×局長辦事，難道還吝惜這點小費嗎？將來接了事……總之，我倆個帮你開消，總比你自己向他們說話便宜多了。我倆帮忙帮到底。」</p>
<p>這時他倆在我的眼睛裏就像勞來哈台一樣，一個裝傻一個裝乖。我自己給他倆捉弄了，心理正是說不出的那麽氣脹，祇想駡個痛快，但東西還沒有領到手，却不便亂得罪人。想起從前制豪衙門的挑水夫要同縣官比大小的故事，却又使我暗暗發笑。我想橫豎離不了錢，於是又摸出一張十元的鈔票。這麽一來，他倆就樂意了，跟即吿訴我應付的方法，同時又把總務科看守稅票那個小工喊來給我介紹。這人姓陳，最多祇有十八歲，我看他人很年輕，以爲是個初出茅廬的小子，很容易對付，殊不知他人小心大，見面不久便問我要錢，並且還說他不但能够領我見總務科長，同時牌照完稅證也可由他情理，他可以帮我弄快一點，不致發生別的留難。我眞不髙興聽他那一長串的話，歸根一句不外要錢。</p>
<p>他滿足了要求，即領我到總務科。見着科長時我就拿出平素的外交手段，說明我不過先來領取東西，×局長到明天早上定來辭行。那科長究竟不類傳達之流，倒並不和我爲難，便吩咐小陳淸理我所應領的東西。但是東西很多，一時不能理淸，呌我下午去取。</p>
<p>到了午後我又進省局的傳達室，那胖瘦二位對我眞客氣：代表長代表短，喊得我眞不過意，又幾次三番催小陳淸理快一點。我想這都是二十元鈔票的代價，俗話說的「有錢能買鬼推磨」却也有相當的道理。但是不久又遇着了重要的難關。那那收發處的，稅務科的小工共來十多個；這個道喜，那個道賀，你拿烟，我遞茶，弄得我面前的茶几上放都放不下了。我心裏雖有點窘促，面子上却很鎭靜，於是依照傳達吿訴我的方法，總不表示態度，他們談什麽，我就談什麽，好在江湖上的道理略懂三，並不感覺怎樣的困難。這麽延長到了一點多鐘，小陳跑來呌我到總務科點收東西。這時科長不在，科負之流同我寒暄了幾句，便問×局長爲什麽不來，這時我巳獲得了很多的經騐，知道稅收機關找不出幾個好人，於是故意說剛纔打電話問過×局長，他說馬上過來向省局各同事辭行。他們倒也半信半疑。接着我就趕快點收了東酉，呌小陳送出門口。這時會經給我敬茶敬烟的朋友都在門口梭巡，好像防備罪犯脫逃一樣。我一面喊呌黄包車搬東西，一面應用像達給我的最後法寳：「×局長關照過我：今天全體都沒有開消，明天他親來請各位吃茶。他還沒有給局長科長辭行哩！」</p>
<p>這時那胖瘦二位傳達又向我做個鬼臉：「請代表致意×局長，明天我們纔給他道賀討喜錢哩！」</p>
<p>好容易突出重圍，跳上了黄包車，心裏還撲通撲通的亂跳。我想出入稅收機關的門眞不容易呵！</p>

<h3 id="c214">經濟恐慌中英國的景氣好轉 <a href="#c214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— 吳士德</p>
<p>自一九二九年世界經濟恐慌發生以來，各帝國主義國家都日益陷於不景氣的苦惱中了。牠們爲了要緩和其各種危機，便實行了種種人爲的辦法，企圖恢復景氣。但是，那些非根本的人爲的辦法並不能在根本上消滅這種普遍而且深入發展的經濟恐慌的災難，至多只能使某些產業部門的情况得以相當的好轉，而且這好轉還是一時的。此種情形，在羅斯福的復興政策下的美國表現得最明顯；同時，在近兩年的英國經濟中也顯明地可以看到。現在，我們所要研究的，便是英國經濟一時的景氣好轉的問題。</p>
<p>在一九三二年那一年中，英國的景氣好轉就漸漸開始了，這好轉的速度至一九三四年下半年就很緩慢，及至年終一期，可說是在根本上已經停頓。英國商務省的指數就很明白地表現着這個發展過程——商務省工業生產指數（一九二八年等於一〇〇）；同時，雜誌「經濟主義者」曾刋有這樣的一個圖表（一九二四年每月平均等於一〇〇）：</p>
<p>一九三四年</p>
<p>前面那個表所指示出的，是從一九三三年開始英國生產指數就在向上發展，但這發展趨勢在一九三四年下半期時就已緩慢乃至停頓；後面這個表不僅表示出了如同前表所表示的那種情况，而且還表現出了在英國的所謂景氣好轉中，最主要的是建築與汽車生產的指數之增加。</p>
<p>但是住宅建築激增的主要原因，第一是長期信用中的利率之低不，其次是在恐慌年中建築費的低下，這事實在下表中表現了出來（一九二四年等於一〇〇）——</p>
<p>最後，使英國的建築事業恢復到某種程度的乃是英鎊的低價。</p>
<p>這樣的建築事業之發展是否還能繼續下去的問題，是完全要由英國的勞動者的狀况來决定；假使勞動者的生活不能改善，假使他們無法改善其住宅　那末在恐慌年中的建築事業的發展，便會成爲一時的現象，是不能繼續下去　。英國的政洽家在選舉競爭中曾高唱除去貧民窟，改良勞動者的住宅，但是直到現在還有尨大的失業軍存在着；這些失業者，連職業問題都不能解决，又怎能離開貧民窟，怎能改良其住宅呢？就是在業的勞動者，也因爲工資的低不，生活窮苦，根本談不到改良其住宅的。這樣，在所謂景氣好轉中佔重要他位的建築事業之發展必然會是暫時的。在事實上從去年年終到現在，英國的建築事業也沒有表現出發展的趨勢了。</p>
<p>復次，便是汽車生產的增加問題。</p>
<p>近年來英國汽車生產的增加的事情，從下表中明白地表現了出來——</p>
<p>乘用小型汽車　大型貨物汽車</p>
<p>一九二九年的前九個月　一八二·三四七五六·四五八</p>
<p>一九三一年的前九個月　一五八·九九七六七·三〇</p>
<p>一九三二年的前九個月　一七一·二四四六一·四七五</p>
<p>從一九三二年十月到一九三三年八月二〇八·三八〇五九·九七八從一九三三年十月到一九三四年八月二四一·六七一七八·六〇一</p>
<p>刺戟英國汽車生產增加的，主要的是英政府對於汽車所有者的課稅减輕。但不管怎樣，汽車的需要總是有限，因之今後英國的汽車生產是否還能繼續增加，仍是一個很大問題。</p>
<p>這樣，在所謂景氣好轉中佔主要地位的建築事業與汽車業之發展趨勢旣不能令人樂觀，那英國的所謂景氣好轉之實質及其前途，於此也就不難窺見了。</p>
<p>在英國的所謂景氣好轉中，除建築業和汽車業表現出了一時的發展形勢外，造船業也有幾分改善。但這改善也不是由於一般產業之改善使然的，主要的乃是英國海軍軍備擴大的結果。現在，英國的經濟狀態，一方面因爲許多人爲的原因，某些產業部門雖有一時的好轉現象，但一般的工業部門之恐慌仍舊在繼續發展，無論纖維工業，炭坑業乃至原有的造船業，固定資本的過剩是比任何時期的都要多。至於對外貿易，近幾年來也有幾分改善。據調査，最近三年來英國的完成工業品之輸出表現出了如下的增加形勢——</p>
<p>一九三二年最後一期　六九·〇（單位百萬鎊）</p>
<p>一九三三年最後一期　七五·二</p>
<p>一九三四年最後一期　八一·一</p>
<p>但是，如果將近年來英國的輸出與恐慌前的水準相較，那情形却就大不相同了“Eonomist”於本年一月十九日刋載了這樣一個數目字的比較表（單位百萬鎊）</p>
<p>上表的數目字所顯示的是近年來英國的輸出雖有幾分增加，但若與恐慌前的水準相較，則仍是較爲减少：這事實，若我們考慮一下近年來物價低落的情形，便更可明白了。至於各種重要商品的輸出，其情形也非常不均等的。事實上，一九三四年度的綿布輸出，比較一九三三年的就有些减少，若與恐慌前的一九二八年度相較，則不過比其半數多一點：毛織物的輸出是在增加，汽車，銑鋼也是一樣；但石炭的輸出現在尙停滯在兩年前的很低的水準上。</p>
<p>由上面的這些實際情形看來，所謂英國的景氣好轉，在事實上是人爲的，部分的，並非一般經濟的向上發展所呈現出來的；而且，由於失業問題的不能解决，勞動者生活的不能改善，國內市塲的消化力的日益减退，英國這種人爲的部份的所謂景氣好轉，還是暫時的，不能繼續維持並發展下去。</p>

<h3 id="c215">傳染病醫院 <a href="#c215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— 克聰</p>
<p>太陽剛伸出半個腦袋，大地上的柏油馬路已經是在淌着汗水了。從家裏出來，身上便成着火烤似的蒸熱；汗水像馬路的柏油似的從毛孔裏滲透出來，走不到幾十步遠，身上的衣服便濕得如同落水鷄似的緊貼在肉上。</p>
<p>受了半點鐘的暑氣蒸發以後，展開在我眼前的却是遍地樹木參天，淸靜得有如庵堂似的環境了。在這樹葉掩蔽的下面露出一截一望無際的黑色的籬笆，緊緊裹着幾幢似乎還是剛完工的新屋。大門兩旁高高揚着國旗。一個潛伏在心裏的念頭，彷彿已經意識到這就是自己所要參觀的「上海市立傳染病醫院」了。</p>
<p>「這傳染病醫院在「一二八」以前原是「閘北公立醫院」，後來毀於砲火，才由衛生局接收下來，改成現在這個醫院。那前面幾幢新屋才完工不久，如照本市的人口比例，病房似乎還嫌不够。」一個職員在會客室裏和我寒院了一陣後，便向外指着前面一排淡黄色的房子和我這樣說。</p>
<p>我們從會客室裏出來，先在空地上走了一圈。醫院所佔的面積大約有二十多畝；外面圍着黑色的籬笆，院裏長滿了高可蔽日的樹木，地上小草像毛毯似的，綠油油的一望無垠。一陣陣淸風穿</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>過樹林吹來，身上便威到像放下了一副幾百斤重的担子似的輕快。</p>
<p>醫院的南部是一幢舊式的病院，與這病院相對峙的便是剛完工的新式病院，長方形的搆造，淡黄色的牆，陽光照在上面，更顯得顏色的恊調與美麗了。三幢病院所能容納的人數大概有一百四十多個。病房分頭二三等三種，頭二等都在二樓，三等在樓下。病房除分等級之外，又分爲小兒病房，男女病房，重病室等數種；其餘如餐室，護士辦公室，病人港室，厠所，都設在這幾幢病院裏面。</p>
<p>對病人的生活環境，確是處處都合乎衛生的原則的。例如病人的飯食，除由「大廚房」製好了照例送上來的不算，還另外在病院裏設有汽爐間，專供一般住院的病人隨時烹煮點心和燒熱水之用；對於病人身體上的淸潔，除了原有的洗浴間而外，又特別置備有一種浴缸，這種浴缸的形式像一輛車子，底下有四只輪子可以自由推動，如有病勢較重的病人不能行動時，就把浴缸推到房間裏沐浴，這給與病人以很多的方便。一幢病院裏被分隔做幾十個房間，每間病房的設備都是下過一番美術設計的功夫的；房裏牆壁上的顏色也和外面的一樣是淡黄色，不過髹漆得比較細緻一些龍了。陳設的傢具，有小茶几，小的寫字檯，還有電鈴：所佔的地位很小，中間空着一塊很大的地方給病人活動。每間房裏的電燈都裝在牆壁中間，外面嵌上一尺多長四寸多寬的白色無光玻璃遮着，射出來的發光帶着柔和而又幽靜的色調；這對於病人的身心和目力，都又分的顯示了配置得宜的效果。</p>
<p>這裏對住院病人的收費辦法，是捕各人的經濟環境而定。頭等病房每天房金六元，可以准許家屬一人陪伴，但每天要付兩元的房飯費用；二等病房每天兩元；二等病房就便宜多了，每天僅祇收費三角。這裏所收容的病人大都是屬於這幾種的傳染病；如傷寒，猩紅熱，腦膜炎，霍亂，赤痢，鼠疫，白喉，斑疹傷寒，天花等等。</p>
<p>他們的預定計劃，原是預備每一種傳染病就有一幢病院，就是所謂「隔離醫院；不過這種計劃因爲目前房屋不敷所用，一時恐不能實現。因爲照他們診治科目的分類，計有九種，應該就需要九幢病院，但現在祇有兩幢完了工可以住人，其餘七幢都還在建造中；所以要想看到這一偉大的計劃的成功，大槪還需要一些時間的吧？</p>

<p>— 張釗心</p>
<p>在一般人的心目中，總認為酆都」是一個有鬼的地方，尤其是一般吃素念佛的太太們，聽見了酆都二個字，便會不寒而慄，認爲那裏是鬼國，誰死了之後，誰就會到那裏去居住。在古老遺傳的神話中，也都說：「那裏是一個鬼國，並且甚有傳稱該地爲人鬼雜處之所。據說那裏也有賣買，店裏的人，在顧客購買物品的時候，先將收進的銅幣投於預先置備的水盆中，銅幣沉者，店裏的人便知道他是人，而將人用之物付之，銅幣浮者，便不是人，而是一個鬼，就將鬼物付之。」聊肅上也曾記載着這樣一段故事：「×××知「酆都」令，到任後，因聞該地有一洞，甚深，相傳爲閻王所居，令不信，乃偕從人入探之。初入時甚黑暗，旋忽開朗，如有白日照耀其間，忽睹一人衣如戲劇中所謂閻王之衣，揖令請入，狀甚恭，日：「某候久矣，請即履新接收。」令大恐，頓首者再，曰：「某家尙有老母在，是烏乎可。」閻王笑日：「是天意也。」因取一簿前，而指之曰：「是早巳載於簿上矣。」令即視之，見簿上書：「×××生身入冥。」因爲有了這樣一段記載，於是便成鐵案，確切地認爲「酆都」是有鬼的，即使是四川人，他們也會這樣的承認。</p>
<p>那末，「酆都」是否是鬼國，在此科學昌明時代，這一個疑問實在是應該打破的。去歲我會作考察四川之行，途經「酆都」，因此便在那裏作半日之勾留，作事實上之探討，以冀打破數千年來這疑問。</p>
<p>出了重慶，船在第二天便到了「酆都」。上了岸，走了沒多遠，便是所謂「酆都」到了。那裏是一座髙山，在高山中間，一劈爲二，中間距離約三四丈，削壁千仭，形勢像是非常危險，快要合攏的樣子。下邊便鱗次地建築着百餘所廟宇，那條三四里長，三尺闊的街道，我們走了幾次，却老沒瞧見一個人影。抬起頭來看着，上面祗見有一片天空，太陽快要爬過山去，黑暗巳經臨到了這槐地上。兩壁髙山搖搖欲墮的，像是隨時有合併的可能。石筍更作各種魔鬼形，有攫人而　之狀，不是我們這般人，恐怕誰也會驚嚇起來，而立刻逃走了。</p>
<p>不一會兒這裏便成了黑夜了。幸虧我們早預備着電筒，這時便立刻運用起來。那一座一座的廟宇都金碧輝煌地露出壯嚴的樣子，那大一點兒的跟杭州的凈慈寺差不多，小一點兒的跟上海馬路上所見的也差不多，可是我們在街上走了不少的路，却始終沒有看到有一個人在走着，除了我們之外。這時，我瞧着我的手表，祗有三點鐘。</p>
<p>「喂！你的錶上幾點鐘了？」我問同伴說，「因爲我的壞了。「</p>
<p>「怎麽的？」他驚呼起來，「天黑了纔三點鐘嗎？」可是幾個同伴的錶上短針都明白地指在三點鐘上。</p>
<p>我們不管這個，祗是挺起胸來，轉動腦筋，想多找一些材料，以充實我們的探討。我們一步一步的向廟宇前的階石上走去。門雖掩而未關，於是我們像偵探一樣地先推開門，用手電筒向裏面照耀着，幾只眼睛像獵犬一樣地向裏面探視着，然後一步一步的走進去。四面牆壁上全塑着各色不同的木偶，都是金裝的，此外便空無所有。這時身上覺得冷不可支，不而得有些發抖了。再進去，便瞧見一個披頭散髮的人，樣子眞像鬼，假使說是有鬼的話，我相信鬼的樣子一定是跟他差不多的。我們定了定神，便向他瞧着，祗見他黧黑的面孔襯着蓬鬆地散披着的長髮，穿着厚棉的衣服，赤着脚，穿着一雙草鞋，十指粗粗地像個紅蘿蔔，旁邊還有幾個光頭的傢伙，都有着結實的身體。我們仔細地瞧了一回，纔相信這幾個都是人，因爲是鬼的話，應該見了我們便會立刻躱避而隱過去了。他們也露出驚異的眼光瞧着我們。</p>
<p>「你們是到這裏來玩的嗎？」一個年紀比較大一些的人站起來招呼我們，他操着純粹的四川下江口音。</p>
<p>「對啦！我們是到這裏來玩的。」我們答着，「你們都是這裏人嗎？」</p>
<p>他點了點頭，招呼我們坐下，於是我開始用談話的方法去找尋我們所需要的材料。</p>
<p>「你們這裏鬼嗎？」我笑着而。</p>
<p>「鬼，我們沒瞧見過，可是我們這裏的人都相信是有的，所以我們是終年住在廟裏，我們每天早上一起身便都到山上一所小廟裏燒香去。那裏的菩薩叫小人子，眞靈透啦！你要是不去燒香，那末，你今天別想過安穩的日子，你睡着的時候便有鬼魔來繞着你，你煮飯，飯會變成了糞。上次有客人來玩，他們當塲試騐，明明放下去的是白米，可是燒了一會兒，拿起鍋蓋來一看，鍋裏那有白米的影子，全變成了糞啦　」</p>
<p>我們笑子，便拿出麵包來吃着，可是一些也沒變味，</p>
<p>「怎麼繼三點鐘天便會黑了？」</p>
<p>「這裏早上要到十一點鐘天纔有亮光，到下午三點鐘便黑了。白天祗有四小時，此外的都是黑夜。」</p>
<p>「這裏有多少人家？」</p>
<p>「大約有一百多家，有五六百人口。這裏現在是改成「　都」縣了，也有縣長，也有公安局，跟外邊也差不多。」</p>
<p>「那末，縣長也在這裏嗎？</p>
<p>「不，我們祇聽說是有縣長，可是我們沒瞧見過。據說縣長因爲太苦了，上任祇是掛「個名，决沒有親自到這裏來的。警察有十幾個，也跟我們一樣的過日子，祇不過每年向我們要錢糧罷了。」</p>
<p>「那你們也種田嗎？」</p>
<p>「當然種的。我們的田都在山上，每年收成倒還好。這裏生產的大部是玉蜀黍，每年都是裝到重慶賣去。賣掉之後，便買洋布回來做衣服，其他雜物也是向那裏去買的，可是路太不便啦！所以一年也難得去幾回。」</p>
<p>「你們搬到「酆都」來多久了啦？爲什麽住在廟裏？」</p>
<p>「那我們可不知道啦！我祇知道我的父親住在此地，此外我全不明白啦！」</p>
<p>「高山中間在這裏分開，到什麽地方便又合攏來？」</p>
<p>「再過去便是巫山，那裏使合攏了。」</p>
<p>時候已經不早，於是我們笑吟着「曾經滄海難爲水，除卻巫山不是雲」的詩句向他們興僻而出，重又覔路而回。</p>

<p>— 辛子</p>
<p>七月十七日某刋物載有寡婦再醮打傷丈夫新聞一則，大意謂「有黄亨弼者，已有妻室，十七年前因供職崇明郵局，長途遠征，關山遙隔，故未携帶眷屬，異地孤蹤，公餘多暇，遂物色佳麗以解岑寂，適夏吳氏新寡，又不容於舅姑，遂爲黄氏以一百三十元之代價向夏姓贖出婚帖而築金屋，旣而黄氏調歸總局，該婦仍留崇島，黄對吳之家用初則尙不時供應，繼因滬寓開支較大，不能若往日供應之裕如，歷時三載，該婦遂尋蹤至滬，與之爲難，終且至局尋釁，將酒瓶擊傷黄氏」云。這個新聞，該刋物記者在標親上是用了「潑辣成性」四字來判决那位再離寡婦的，而對於黄亨弼者則似乎已在該記者的筆下得到原諒了。</p>
<p>在男性尙支配着一切的現社會，該案應得如此的評價是意中事。男性爲了享樂，到處可以去找一個性的發洩機器，所以如黄亨弼者，雖在一夫一妻制的現在，他可以築金屋，乘人於家庭不睦經濟困厄之際作入幕之賓。這種不合法的結婚現象，君慧女士在現代的結婚興離婚一文中說得最痛切：「這種結合在我們婦女的立塲看來，完全是犧牲婦女的人權去滿足男子的性生活的極端不道德的一種現象。作姘頭生活的男子天部分在家庭中有其髮妻，在因其職務關係離家旅居的時候，用金錢勢利及其他種種欺騙方法誘引婦女不合法的實行同居</p>
<p>以下接第五版</p>

<p>，但到他覺得厭倦的時候梗棄之如敝屣。」對於黄亨弼氏的不道德行爲，我們爲了正義，理宜首先加以聲討，但我們在與論上所見的斥責是再醮「寡婦」的『潑辣「成」性』，而沒有見到黄亨弼的「蹂躪女性」，殊失事理之平！</p>
<p>一夫一妻的結婚制度在我們堂皇的律法上是已有確實的條文了，然而我們所看到的社會現象，男性在一妻之外，他仍然有方法在「一妻」的名義的背後去幹種種多妻的實際行動，嫖妓，姘居，這些難道還不够說明多妻制度的實際存在嗎？在商品經濟支配着的資本主義社會的現在，貞操觀念還是片面存在的，一夫一妻制度也仍然無非爲了東縛女性的貞操吧了！</p>
<p>黄亨弼氏的對髮妻對吳氏，都是一貫的當作「旅館交易式的性買賣」對象，他本人是可以隨遇而安的，無論在崇島或在滬濱，他都可以得到性的滿足。在性交易關係的持續中，他自然以金錢供應爲欺騙對方的唯一手段，等到性交易一旦中斷（如黃氏之離開崇明之後），他就連金錢供應的掩護手段也放棄了！吳氏在法律上是沒有地位的，她被黄氏始亂終棄之後，她能得到法律上公允的救濟嗎？她不能，她將怎樣應付呢？在一般封建女子，也許會飲泣吞聲的投環或服毒以求解脫了吧？這自然是弱者的行爲，但我們的再醮寡婦，尙能因「潑誎成性」而有勇氣將一酒瓶去痛擊那「蹂躪女性」的黄亨弼，我們試設想這一擊裏面是包含了多少幾千年來鬱積在女人心坎中的怨抑和侮辱啊！然而，這可憐的寡婦終於被判定了「潑辣成性」的罪名了！</p>

<p>— 鍾民誼</p>
<p>（二）南洋的華僑</p>
<p>南洋，是包括着馬來半島，印度支那及東印度羣島等地的。現在，我們要對這些地方的華僑情形分別加以叙述。</p>
<p>暹羅暹羅界於法屬安南與英屬馬來半島之間，位於亞洲東南的印度支那半島上。遠在南北朝時代，暹羅卽遣使入貢中國；其與中國發生關係，當然還要古遠。迄至現在，華僑在暹羅者已有三百多萬，佔全暹人口四分之一以上，佔世界華僑總數的三分之一。暹羅華僑在世界華僑中所佔的地位，華僑與暹羅國的關係，於此可見。</p>
<p>在暹羅的華僑多半來自廣東與福建，他們大都是在這裏經營工商業，在暹羅的經濟中他們佔着極重要的地位，差不多所有暹羅的重要工商業都在他們掌握之中。大家知道，如米業礦業乃是暹邏主要產業，但據一九一九年的調査，單是盤谷一城，共有大碾米廠六十七家，其中爲華人所有者就有五十六家，此外如製糖業，木材業，典當業，也都是華僑所經營。如果單從經濟方面來說，暹羅可說是華僑的暹羅了。</p>
<p>但是，一個國家的殖民世界，單靠其僑民的經濟力量和刻苦精神是不能一直向前發展的；所以，近代的許多獨立國家的殖民政策，都是在國家的政治力量下施行的。中國是落後的半殖民地的國家，自來就沒有一定的移民政策，更說不上如何去帮助散處在世界各地的僑民。華僑在暹羅雖有那麼大的力量，但直至現在中暹尙未訂立正式國交。因此，華僑在暹羅越是發展，便越是要遭到暹羅政府的壓制和排斥而無法對付。近年以來，暹羅政府曾一再頒布移民律，迭次增加華人的入口稅，以限制華人進口。尤有甚者，就是最近以來的取締華僑學校，實施同化我僑胞的强迫敎育，以冀同化我三百萬僑民爲暹人，接收我偌大的財產。據調資，在去年一年之內，被暹政府封閉的華校就有七十餘所之多。至於華僑所經營的工商業更特別被徵收重稅，使其無法維持；華僑要匯欵回國也遭禁止和限制；前年十月在暹羅南境竟發生了暹警屠殺華僑的大慘劇，死者達數十人之多；最近我僑胞更被一批一批地壓迫歸來；……所有這些，都是暹羅政府壓迫華僑之具體的表現。現時暹羅的排斥華僑運動尙在有增無已，如我們不趕緊設法對付，恐怕在暹羅的三百萬僑胞都將不能立足下去了！</p>

<h3 id="e1">Continuing Rise of the Water Level in Weishan Lake, Collapse of the West Dyke of the Grand Canal, Connection of the Two Waters, Flooding of Lakeside Beaches for Three to Four Li, People of Pei and Tong Counties Rush to Build the North Jiangsu Dam, Lu and Han Telegraph Lin and Jiang Regarding Dam Construction, Requesting Verification <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>Tongshan and Pei Telegraphs, the water level of Weihu Lake continued to rise by half a meter on the 26th, and it is still rising. At present, it has not yet overflowed its banks. However, according to measurements, it is due to the full water in western Shandong and the Nanyang Lake bearing the main current, so it is constantly pouring into Weihu Lake. The northern part of Pei, Feng, and Qian counties is gradually becoming strained. (Special Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to Building Department Engineer Yu Shufang, who inspected the Hukou Shuangzha (Double Sluice) yesterday in Hanzhuang, at the same time, Dang and Sui technicians Liao Chengzhang and He Shiliang were also measuring in Hanzhang. According to them, the Hukou Shuangzha is the entrance for Weishan water into the canal. The two sluices are connected, each 7 meters wide, 5 meters deep, and the dam is 6.5 meters high. It is connected to the west embankment of the Grand Canal, which is 36 Chinese li long and has 12 culverts. Now the entire embankment has collapsed, causing the Weiyun water above the Shuangzha to connect. If only the Shuangzha is repaired, it will not be enough to talk about storage and discharge, and it still needs to be submitted to the department for verification and further planning. The current water level of the sluice is 2.49 meters. (Special Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Since the water level of Weihu Lake rose sharply starting on the 25th, it continued to rise on the 26th. According to a phone report from Pei County at noon on the 27th, the lake water has now risen to 2.5 meters, and the lakeside beaches are flooded for three to four li, which is very close to the North Jiangsu Dam currently under construction. Commissioner Shao Hanyuan is in Pei and Tong counties, supervising the two county heads to rush the construction day and night, and the people are also working hard. (Central News Agency Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Tongshan) The Tongshan Yellow River Prevention Association held its inaugural meeting in the county government this morning. It was decided that people from all walks of life would jointly telegraph Chairman Chen of the Provincial Government and Shen Yingchang of the Building Department, requesting them to come to Xuzhou to inspect Weihu Lake and Tongzha, as well as the North Jiangsu Dam, and to determine the overall strategy for Yellow River prevention in northern Jiangsu, concentrate the strength of all parties, intensify the Yellow River prevention work, and complete the Yellow River prevention project. (Special Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) A telegram from Huaiyin states that the water in Xia Town, Jiangsu, has completely receded. Although Weihu Lake is rising, it is not yet endangering Jiangsu. The Huai River Diversion Office is rushing to build the dikes of the Yishu Tail Section area for Yellow River prevention. (Special Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Zhenjiang) Xu Dingkang arrived in Huaiyin on the 26th to preside over flood control on the Grand Canal. (Special Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Huaiyin The Huaiyin office set up by the Jiangsu Provincial Government for flood control of the Jiangbei Zhongli Two Canal and Liutang River, with Xu Dingkang as the director, Ge Hanlou as the chief engineer, and Sun Fengwu as the technical director, in addition to being formally established and starting to work, all future flood control plans, work progress, and Yellow River prevention budgets for the counties along the river, should no longer be submitted to the provincial department for verification, but should be directly submitted to the office for handling. Also, Director Xu is scheduled to arrive in Huaiyin tonight. (Special Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Huaiyin) News from the Huaipi section: the Yellow River water in Xia Town has completely receded, the Weihu Lake has dropped by six sheng, the waters of each section of the Zhongyun River are also falling, the weather is clearing, and the wood is no longer rising. (Special Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>Zhenjiang The Provincial Government received a report from the water station that on the 26th, the water level of the Yellow River in Zhongmou was 86.06 meters, Heigangkou was 79.97, the Grand Canal in Suqian was 18.33, the Qingjiang sluice was 9.24, Wangwan was 19.60, Weishan Lake was 31.683, Gouzha on the 26th was 4.54, Yumatou on the 26th was 5.15, and Wanjiatang on the 26th was 5.22. It also received a telegram from Pei County on the 26th stating that Weishan Lake rose another half a meter on the 26th. Also, a telegram from Donghai on the 26th stated that the water level of the Liutang River in the Donghai section was stable, and the river embankment was well repaired. (Special Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Zhao Bingheng, a technician from the Huai River Diversion Association, and Zhou Yushan, a representative from the Jiangsu Building Department, went to the border between Jiangsu and Shandong to inspect the breach of the Shandong dike and the southward migration of the main current. Zhao and others returned to Beijing on the 27th and said that the six breaches at Dongzhuang and Linpuji had gradually become silted up, and the main current of the river was flowing out of the fifth and sixth breaches. The current situation is that the water flow is gradually slowing down. If there are no special changes, Jiangsu should be safe. However, if there is a second incident, the Yellow River water may still invade the Huai and Grand Canals, so it is necessary to plan ahead. (Special Dispatch on the 27th)</p>
<p>(Jinan) Han Fuju telegraphed Lin, Jiang, Wang, Kong, Huang Fu, and Li Yizhi of the Economic Commission today regarding the construction of dikes in Weihu Lake, northern Jiangsu, stating that he had repeatedly received reports from the people in the disaster areas of various counties that the water level of the Zhu and Zhao Wang Rivers had risen again due to the Shu River and had breached their banks one after another. The reason for this was that dikes and sluices were built in Jiangsu Province to intercept the Yellow River water, preventing the downstream from discharging and causing the water in Nanyang Lake to back up. The appeals were filled with indignation. After investigation, the facts stated were indeed true. If immediate rescue measures are not taken, the flood will overflow and flood without end, and the people's hearts will be easily disturbed, so it is feared that other problems will arise. Fuju believes that this matter is of great importance and dare not keep it from his superiors, so he respectfully telegraphed the situation, asking for verification, and also telegraphed Kong requesting an allocation of 2 million yuan for disaster relief.

<h3 id="e32">A Word to Those Discussing Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation in North China <a href="#e32" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c32" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">32</a></h3>
<p>— Year</p>
<p>Yesterday, this newspaper received a special telegram from Tianjin reporting that Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China is being discussed by both parties in Tianjin. Participants include bankers and industrialists from China and Japan, as well as officials from the municipal government on the Chinese side, and officials from the garrison army, embassy, and consulates on the Japanese side. The long-rumored issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in North China has now gradually reached the stage of implementation from incubation. We dare to offer a word to the gentlemen from both sides participating in the discussion based on our observations. This economic cooperation between the two countries in North China is driven by military and political forces. This cannot be denied, nor should it be denied. Now that it has become inevitable, and both parties are engaging in calm discussions, there is a slight chance to salvage the situation and retain mutually beneficial elements. This is the hope that the Chinese people should have under unavoidable circumstances. What special significance does the term "economic cooperation" have in this discussion? Let us put that aside for now. If we interpret it according to its ordinary meaning, it should represent an action of equality and mutual benefit. If the gentlemen from both sides participating in the discussion can stick to the facts and use this ordinary interpretation of the term as the standard for their progress, the benefits will not only accrue to the area being developed. Even the party investing huge sums of money will have unlimited hopes. Your reporter is not unaware of the decisions made by the Japanese Kwantung Army before this discussion, or of the initiators and their policies. However, the situation has changed, and formally, it has become a discussion of economic issues. The focus of the discussion, based on proper observation, cannot but be "Japan is preparing to invest huge amounts of capital in Hebei, Chahar, and other provinces in China, and jointly seek safe and appropriate arrangements." How Japan will invest this money, whether through loans or joint ventures, remains to be decided through discussion. However, the mention of safety and appropriateness means that the previous methods used to create this cooperation must be completely abandoned, and a search for equality and mutual benefit must be made. If military force and international political power are used as the basis for investment, the basis is no longer safe or appropriate. What is the point of discussion then? Among the Japanese bankers and industrialists attending, there are no shortage of people with foresight. If they can transcend the environment and express their insightful opinions, the outcome of the discussion may not violate the justice of economic cooperation and may find a safe and appropriate path. As for the Chinese attendees, we hope that they will adhere to the principles of equality and mutual benefit, and respond carefully. The discussion must be limited to purely economic development, and the proposals must be based on the standard of not harming national sovereignty and people's livelihoods when implemented. They must weigh the interests of both parties and not lose their final position. Since a meeting has been held for discussion, according to common sense, it has become an event in which the other party invests in North China and promotes its goods, while we use foreign capital to develop the local economy. At the very least, the principle of equivalent gains and losses must be firmly adhered to.</p>
<p>The situation between China and Japan has made economic cooperation in North China unavoidable. In the process of cooperation, do not make more mistakes. This is the key point. We analyze this in detail to the gentlemen from both sides at the meeting, focusing on the fundamental points. As for the detailed discussions, they should be based on not violating these fundamental points. Only then can we speak of economic cooperation.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Takahashi's statement yesterday warned that it is absolutely necessary to limit the issuance of public bonds to make up for budget shortfalls. Newspapers have expressed great support for this statement. Takahashi said that continuing to issue too many bonds would lead the country to bankruptcy. The Nichinichi Shimbun said that Takahashi's remarks were very timely and wished the Finance Minister success in curbing budget expansion and stabilizing finances. However, the army and navy do not agree with the Finance Minister's words. While praising the Finance Minister's efforts, they said that in view of the international situation, safeguarding national defense is of the utmost importance. A spokesman for the Seiyukai said that there is ample capacity to issue bonds to make up for budget shortfalls, while other political parties support the Finance Minister. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The naval authorities expressed dissatisfaction with the Finance Minister's statement on public bond policy. They issued a statement saying that the Navy's budget is very inflated, which the Ministry of Finance has long been aware of. Now that the Ministry of Finance does not advocate increasing the issuance of public bonds and has no source of funds, how will military spending be raised? The Navy's demands are very pressing, and the Ministry of Finance cannot simply ignore them by saying that it cannot increase the issuance of public bonds. (27th Electric News Telegram)</p>
<p>Minister of the Army Hayashi, who is currently in Osaka, made the following remarks before returning to Tokyo: It is gratifying that those involved in the military-industrial complex have shifted from a focus on profits to recognizing the importance of the military-industrial complex. Finance Minister Takahashi has stated his public bond policy, which is only natural for a finance minister. However, national defense spending is absolutely inflexible, so although a thorough gradual reduction policy is in place, it cannot be recklessly cut. It is rumored that the military is criticizing the source of funds, but this is obviously something that outsiders cannot do. The outside world believes that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of the Army seem to be arguing, but in fact, there is no such thing. The Army is determined not to be rigid and will negotiate peacefully with the authorities of the Ministry of Finance. (27th Electric News Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Army holds the following views on Finance Minister Takahashi's statement on public bonds yesterday: The Army is very concerned about national finances, given the pressure of the international situation in recent years. We do not take more than is necessary, which is understood by the Ministry of Finance. We only hope to receive the minimum amount of military spending calculated from a sense of responsibility. If a budget can be compiled that does not cause anxiety to the industrial, financial, and the entire national community, the Ministry of Finance can either explore a gradual reduction of public bonds or a tax increase policy, which the military will fully support. (27th Electric News Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Nagai, chairman of the Policy Research Committee of the Minseito, told reporters regarding Finance Minister Takahashi's statement yesterday that the Finance Minister's statement is aimed at harmonizing national defense and finance, and at placing national defense and the people's lives on a permanent and strong foundation, which is very commendable. (27th Electric News Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Finance Minister Takahashi's statement is aimed at cultivating the ability to issue public bonds in the future, and has won excellent reviews in the financial community. Some believe that for the budget for the coming year, which is imminent, the military's demands will be very large, and the Finance Minister's policy may not be fully realized. The natural increase in tax revenue related to the budget for the coming year is about 70 million yen for the tenth year. Adding in state-owned income and other natural increases, it is feared that it will not exceed 100 million yen. Even with this calculation, the income increased by each ministry and department, the ordinary income of the eleventh year's regular and temporary departments, compared to the 1.44 billion yen in the tenth year, or the increase is difficult to exceed 130 million yen. As for expenditures, the intentions of the Army and Navy are that the Navy is demanding 710 million yen and the Army is demanding 630 million yen. Compared with the increase of 180 million and 130 million in the tenth year, the total increase is 310 million. In addition, it is difficult to expect a significant reduction in general government expenses. In short, in addition to the expansion of military spending in the budget for the coming year, although each ministry has increased income and reduced established expenses, the absolute amount exceeds this year's budget. Therefore, contrary to Finance Minister Takahashi's gradual reduction policy on public bonds and the efforts of the Ministry of Finance authorities, the result will only be a verbal call. Therefore, the Finance Minister's statement on the expansion of public bonds is contrary to this fact. (27th Electric News Telegram)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) In order to rectify elections and reform the parliamentary system, the Japanese Ministry of Home Affairs plans to first establish a permanent solution for the future. The first step is to seek the assistance of scholars with ambitions in the private sector to investigate examples from the parliamentary political history of various advanced countries in the world. Special attention will be paid to the application of their electoral systems, the reality of corruption, and countermeasures, as materials for reference. Professors Rosan Masamichi, Kawahara Jikichiro, and several other scholars have been entrusted to collect the following documents:</p>
<p>1.  The circumstances and causes of electoral corruption.</p>
<p>2.  Purification countermeasures taken by legislative means.</p>
<p>3.  Corrective measures taken by political education.</p>

<p>(Changchun) After the previous major cabinet reshuffle in "Manchukuo," the government's various organizations and officials will undergo major changes at the end of this month to reform the administrative structure. (1) The State Council will strengthen the General Affairs Agency and make it the center of administration, while reducing the size of the Legislative Bureau, the Supervisory Yuan, and the Supervisory Department, and subordinating them to the General Affairs Agency. (2) The Supervisory Yuan's original supervisory duties over administrative matters have been reassigned to the General Affairs Agency, so the Supervisory Yuan's work will be changed to the Audit Yuan, establishing an organization similar to the Japanese Board of Audit. (3) The name of the Legislative Yuan will remain the same, but its content will be reduced to a minimum, only undertaking the necessary work of investigating and preparing for the parliamentary system. The changes on the right are directly related to the reform of the "Manchukuo" government's administrative structure, and a large number of Japanese and "Man" officials will also be replaced.

<h3 id="e43">The Mysterious Lake Baikal <a href="#e43" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c43" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">43</a></h3>
<p>(TASS, July 4, Ulan-Ude dispatch) The mystery of Lake Baikal has attracted the attention of scientists around the world. The lakebed contains vast amounts of fish, forests, and minerals. The Baikal Basin is the largest basin in the world, surrounded by mountains. The highest of these mountains rises 1,400 meters above the lake surface and 1,850 meters above sea level. The lake is 660 kilometers long, 85 kilometers wide, and approximately 2,200 kilometers in circumference. Its area is second only to the Caspian Sea.</p>
<p>The deepest part of Lake Baikal, as far as is known, reaches 1,741 meters, making it the deepest freshwater lake in the world. There are 27 islands in the lake, the largest of which is Olkhon Island, which is 10 kilometers wide and 69 kilometers long. Three hundred and thirty-six rivers flow into the lake, the largest of which is the Selenga River, which is navigable. Only one river flows out of the lake, the Lower Angara River.</p>
<p>The lake is famous for its extremely low salt content. The lake water is clear, and white objects can be seen at a depth of 40 meters in some places. Lake Baikal has a great impact on the climate in the vicinity, regulating temperature changes. The lake water freezes completely at the end of December and melts at the end of May.</p>
<p>The flora and fauna at the bottom of the lake have enormous scientific value in addition to their practical benefits. As far as is known, there are 1,300 species of animals and plants, of which about 80% are local to the lake. Some carp live in water 1,500 meters deep, where the pressure reaches 150 atmospheres. Among the industrial fish, the native salmon called "Omul" ranks first, followed by sturgeon and whitefish. Among the marine animals, the native seal has special economic value, and more than 6,000 seals are caught each year.</p>
<p>The Baikal Basin is rich in minerals, including gold, coal, petroleum, iron, and other metals.</p>
<p>From a scientific point of view, Lake Baikal is a museum of ancient life that can help us solve a number of biological and geological problems. From an economic point of view, the lake provides a rich basis for the economic development of the Buryat-Mongol Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic.</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Council of the League of Nations decided to meet at 5:00 PM on July 31st to discuss the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. There has been no definite reply as to whether Italy will send a representative. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) People here now believe that Italy will not send a representative to the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations if it involves issues other than the border conflict. The Italian authorities are currently awaiting a reply from the Abyssinian government on this matter, but it is reported that the Italian government reserves the right to submit a statement, whether or not a representative attends. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Geneva) There is now a slightly more optimistic outlook here regarding the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations to discuss the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia. It is expected that the Council will put pressure on Abyssinia to agree to continue the mediation process and will also elect a fifth arbitrator. If Abyssinia agrees, the Council will reaffirm the provision in Article 5 of the 1928 Italo-Abyssinian Treaty that both parties agree not to resort to force. The Council meeting may then conclude within 48 hours. If Abyssinia insists on a comprehensive discussion and the proposal to send neutral observers to the scene, a serious situation may arise. (27th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) After Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval met with British Ambassador to France Sir Eric Phipps this morning, there has been no progress in peacefully resolving the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, but diplomatic sources believe that after convening a meeting, the Council of the League of Nations may announce a postponement of the meeting until September, so that the Italo-Abyssinian Mixed Arbitration Committee can first resume work and conduct conciliation proceedings, and the countries concerned can also take the opportunity to establish a compromise plan. If Italy accepts the appointment of a fifth neutral arbitrator designated by the Council when the Council meets, this solution will certainly be easier to initiate. (26th Havas Telegram)</p>
<p>(Paris) Although the Italo-Abyssinian situation is very tense, those close to Prime Minister Laval seem to hope that the Council of the League of Nations will be able to avoid a serious conflict at its meeting and postpone the issue until the end of August for further discussion, so as to allow time for diplomatic negotiations. According to general observations, the Council meeting will focus on discussing future steps. Abyssinia is asking the League of Nations to handle the whole problem, which is aided by England, while Italy insists on limiting the discussion to certain specific issues. The French political community still believes that Laval's diplomatic skills will be able to eliminate this difficulty invisibly, and it is reported that Eden will make a brief stop in Paris when he goes to Geneva, at which time Laval and Eden will be able to agree on joint action.

<h3 id="e45">Italy Ready to Resume Mediation with League of Nations <a href="#e45" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c45" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">45</a></h3>
<p>(London) Italy has recently received a notification from the Secretariat of the League of Nations inviting it to attend the meeting of the Council of Administration. It is now planning to send Mr. Aloisi, the Chief Secretary of the Prime Minister's Office, as the Italian representative to Geneva. It is believed here that Italy's preparation to attend the Council of Administration is not so much a new compromise towards Abyssinia as it is a gesture of friendship towards France. According to diplomatic sources, Aloisi's instructions are limited to discussing the Walwal incident. The border issue between Italian East Africa and Abyssinia, as well as the entire dispute between Italy and Abyssinia, are not included. Therefore, the initial difficulty for the Council of Administration lies in deciding whether the scope of discussion should be limited to the Walwal incident according to Italy's view, or whether a comprehensive study of the Italy-Abyssinia dispute should be conducted according to Britain's view. It is generally believed that after the anti-British demonstrations held in Rome last night, Britain's position is even less likely to change. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government has recently sent a memorandum to the Secretariat of the League of Nations, stating that the Italian government informed the Abyssinian government on July 4th of its willingness to resume the work of the Mixed Arbitration Commission, but the issues discussed by the Commission should be limited to the Walwal conflict. Currently, the Abyssinian government has not yet responded to Italy's notification. Therefore, the Italian government cannot immediately respond to the invitation to attend the meeting of the Council of Administration of the League of Nations. If Abyssinia accepts Italy's proposal and resumes the work of the Arbitration Commission, Italy is willing to participate in the meeting of the Council of Administration. However, what the Council of Administration discusses at that time should be limited to facilitating the work of the Arbitration Commission. If some member states of the League of Nations seek to raise other issues, Italy will reserve its attitude. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<h3 id="e46">Abyssinian Emperor Issues Declaration Seeking Peace <a href="#e46" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c46" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">46</a></h3>
<p>The Abyssinian Emperor in the capital, Addis Ababa, recently issued a declaration to the press, pointing out two points: (1) The Abyssinian government is determined to seek a peaceful resolution to the Italy-Abyssinia dispute. (2) The main reason for the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia is due to the different interpretations by the two governments of the treaty signed on May 16, 1908, regarding the demarcation of the border between Abyssinia and Italian Somaliland. As for the present, although Italy has accepted the submission to arbitration in principle, in fact, it is using various means to make arbitration impossible. Italy denies that the Arbitration Commission has the right to interpret which side the Walwal territory belongs to, whether the occupation of the Walwal area is legal, and refuses to appoint a fifth neutral arbitrator by the Council of Administration of the League of Nations. If so, how can the arbitration process proceed? In short, which member state of the League of Nations is openly infringing upon the sovereignty and independence of other countries, and which country is using force as a political tool for external expansion? These two should now be decided by the Council of Administration of the League of Nations. We now await the decision of the Council of Administration with great confidence. (Havas, 27th)</p>
<p>Today in Addis Ababa, the Abyssinian Emperor told guests that it is unfair for Britain and other countries to ban the export of arms to Abyssinia. It is even more regrettable that foreign companies undertaking contracts for military equipment needed by the Abyssinian army have suddenly terminated their contracts. The Emperor also described the organization of the Abyssinian army's combat, saying that seven main leaders each lead a corps. Although they have some independent rights for special missions, they will act jointly. Because Abyssinia's military equipment is inferior, each corps cannot adopt modern military systems, but each regiment will have countless reconnaissance teams to assist. These people are born warriors and act quickly. The most difficult thing for Abyssinia is the shortage of ammunition. The Emperor believes that the war situation is still unfavorable to the Italian army. The Italian army will encounter unexpected difficulties in the high mountains. New weapons cannot be used there. Furthermore, it is doubtful whether the native soldiers recruited by Italy in Eritrea and Italian Somaliland will be loyal and reliable if they engage in combat with their own kind. The Emperor finally spoke of Abyssinia's development, saying that it should proceed gradually and not seek speed. (Reuters, 26th)</p>
<p>The Abyssinian people in Addis Ababa are now awaiting the meeting of the Council of Administration of the League of Nations with a very calm attitude and have not expressed any xenophobic sentiments. Regarding the issue of arms imports, according to well-informed sources, Britain will not object to arms passing through its territory to Abyssinia. However, according to official sources, the import of arms into Abyssinia has been suspended for ten months. (Havas, 26th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Mr. Grillis, a correspondent for the Paris Echo in Rome, claims that Abyssinia has a well-organized army of 100,000 to 120,000 men, equipped with European equipment and trained by Belgian instructors. However, in terms of artillery, there are only a few batteries of old-fashioned artillery, about 500 machine guns. As for ammunition, a large quantity must have been stored in advance in some locations in the country's mountains for a long time. In addition, the new equipment available in the army is only a few tanks and some aircraft. Abyssinia has a population of about 10 million, of which 500,000 to 600,000 people, including women and children, at most about 1 million people, can serve the Emperor. The reporter also said: "Abyssinia's area is twice that of France. Its climate is hot and unbearable, and its terrain is mountainous. It is easy to put up a heroic and strong resistance against the invasion of a powerful neighbor. As for Italy, its army that has already opened up in East Africa currently has 120,000 men. Once the mobilized troops from the home country arrive, it will increase to 150,000 men. When the main battle starts in the future, its troop strength may be greatly increased or decreased. This army has a large number of modern equipment, especially tanks, machine gun vehicles, and aircraft. Forty airfields have been set up for reconnaissance and bombing aircraft to land. However, the use of this new air force may not immediately achieve final victory. Although Addis Ababa is only 750 kilometers away from the Italian army's airfield, Italian three-engine bombers carrying one ton of bombs can travel 2,000 kilometers and bomb it. However, the capital of Abyssinia is a city of 100,000 people, and even if it is destroyed, it will not do much harm. This matter is the same as when Napoleon I marched into Russia in 1812 and burned Moscow, which has nothing to do with the final victory of the war." (Havas, 27th)</p>

On the one hand, Italy's silver demand is not very large. On the other hand, judging from the current sluggish state of the silver market, it is enough to prove that this statement is inaccurate.

The draft has now been sent to Germany. It is said that Germany will not accept it unless the convention states that bilateral agreements are rejected. However, it is believed that even if the convention rejects this type of agreement, Germany will still hold other objections and not participate in this agreement.

It is generally believed that former Prime Minister Colijn will be reappointed to form a new cabinet.

<p>Athens According to a newspaper with well-informed monarchist sources, the conditions for the return of former Greek King George to restore his government are as follows: (1) The plebiscite on the restoration should allow the public to freely express their opinions; (2) Whether the majority supporting the plebiscite is sufficient for him to return should be decided by him; (3) He is unwilling to implement the restoration through a violent coup. The newspaper also claimed that Prime Minister Tsaldaris has agreed to these conditions. At the same time, the Communist Party and some Republican groups have announced a 24-hour strike in the name of opposing the delay in holding a plebiscite on the restoration issue.

Their companions on the shore cheered. The crew of the Bremen hurriedly launched a small boat to retrieve the German flag and hung it back on the pole. Later, they raised the swastika flag high, saluted it, and sang patriotic songs. All the police from nearby police stations were dispatched to disperse the demonstrators.

<p>(Moscow) Efforts to eliminate the conflict at the Halaha Temple, with the Kurun authorities again beginning negotiations in Manchuria, have not progressed. The last meeting on July 13th discussed to which side the Halaha Temple belonged. It was originally scheduled to hold a meeting on July 15th to continue the meeting, but the puppet representative repeatedly and firmly demanded it. However, due to Manchuria's evasion of the work of the committee, it failed to be held. During private talks between Mongolian representatives and Manchurian representatives (especially during talks between Sambu and Japanese representative Kangki of the Manchurian Foreign Ministry), the Manchurian representative insisted that unless Mongolia gives a satisfactory response to the demands raised by Japan and Manchuria, the work of the committee will not be able to continue.</p>
<p>Well-informed sources in Kurun believe that this is new evidence of the Manchurian military's efforts, at any cost, to make the relationship between Manchuria and Outer Mongolia increasingly tense. (Tass, 27th)</p>

<p>Terrible Flood Situation in Hanchuan: 98% of the County Submerged, 5,000 People Drowned, 60,000 Houses Collapsed - Report After Inspection by Ai Yuying of the Provincial Party Committee</p>
<p>Hankou Communication: This year's flood in Hubei Province is most severe in the Xiang River basin, and among the Xiang River basin, Fancheng, Zhongxiang, Tianmen, and Hanchuan are the most tragic. Although this reporter is stationed in Hankou and has been reporting news from various places to this newspaper from time to time, I regret that I have not been able to provide detailed information because I have not personally experienced it. In order to understand the disaster situation in various places, the Hubei Provincial Party Department specially dispatched member Ai Yuying to inspect the Xiang River basin. Yesterday, she arrived in Hanchuan and reported the inspection situation to the Provincial Party Department today. The report is very detailed. The report briefly states that starting from Wuchang, passing through Hanyang to Hanchuan, there is no land for more than 180 li. Arriving at Hanchuan County, mooring the boat on the embankment, refugees set up shacks and lived in a mixed way, and it was impossible to find a way to enter the city. According to the refugees on the embankment, there were still several feet of water in the city, so they returned to the boat to wait for Huang Zhiyuan, a cadre of the County Party Department, to come to the boat and ask him to guide them. First, they ascended Xiannv Mountain. The mountain has the tomb of Chu Lingyin Ziwen. According to the county chronicles, the top of the mountain is a square platform, which is where King Xiang of Chu entered the dream in Gaotang. Below is Lake Yaohan, covering an area of ​​more than 100 li, which bandits once used as a den. From the mountain overlooking the entire county, both the north and south banks are a vast expanse of water. Only one dike is still partially preserved, and Yanglinggou in the third district is not flooded. Then they went to the county seat to investigate and rescued about 4,000 disaster victims, all of whom were taken in by the county government. What they urgently need is not money but food and medicine. County Magistrate Zhou Yuwen supervised the construction of the dike and worked day and night for half a month, which was quite appreciated by the people. However, the Dike Construction Bureau, which was specifically responsible, was indifferent and did not make any preparations in advance, and cut corners on materials during the emergency rescue, which made the people extremely dissatisfied. As for the disaster, according to the investigation, it can be divided into three stages. On the morning of July 7, Yangchikou on the north bank of the Xiang River and Yanjiawan on the south bank collapsed at the same time. Both breaches were near the county seat. Jiangxiyuan, Mabou, Yaoeryuan, and Yahu on the north bank and Boziyuan on the south bank were all submerged. This was the first stage. On the morning of the 9th, the Xiang River flooded into the western part of the county due to the collapse of the Shangsangguan Dike in Zhongxiang Siyuan. The water was so large that the dikes could not be blocked. As a result, more than 200 dikes, accounting for two-thirds of the entire county's area north of the Xiang River, were almost completely flooded within two days. The county seat was also affected on the 10th, destroying three sections of the city wall. This was the second stage. At noon on the 13th, the Yangtze River water poured into the southern part of the county through Duntou, and at the same time, the Cekou River, a southern tributary of the Han River, overflowed to the east and joined the Yangtze River water. The most important Nanping Dike sank to the bottom of the water, and the nearby small dikes were completely destroyed. This was the third stage. 1.4 million mu of the county's 1.5 million mu of land were flooded, accounting for 98% of the county's area. Of the 390,000 people in the county, 320,000 were disaster victims. The number of people who died in the water could not be accurately determined, but the Cao Lake coast in the northern part of the county was the most severely affected. In the Penggang Lake township in the east of the county, 300 to 400 people drowned. Doubu Township, Xiazi Township, and Heitan Township were even lower and were the first to be hit by the water from Zhongxiang and Tianmen. The number of deaths was about 3,000 to 4,000. The disaster victims who did not die gathered on the dikes, exposed to the sun and water vapor, eating and sleeping in the open air. Epidemics spread, and the number of people who died from cholera and heatstroke was countless. It can be assumed that the total number of deaths was 5,000. In addition, of the 80,000 houses in the county, more than 60,000 were washed away or collapsed. Rice was produced in the northern dikes and cotton was produced along the Xiang River, all of which were lost to the flood. The spring harvest of soybeans and wheat, as well as silver, clothes, livestock, and farming tools, were all lost due to the lack of time to rescue them. It was truly an unprecedented catastrophe.

<h3 id="e92">Detailed Information on the Yanshi Flood Presented by the County Magistrate to the Henan-Shandong Supervisory Office <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>Luoyang Communication: In the first ten days of this month, the river water rose sharply, the Yanshi city dike breached, and the entire city was submerged, causing serious disasters. The following is a selection of the information presented by Yang Zhaofang, the magistrate of Yanshi County, to the Henan-Shandong District Supervisory Office on the 17th of this month. Reading it will show the detailed situation of the county's flood: (1) Topography of the county: The county is mountainous in the north and south, with the Yi and Luo Rivers running through the center. Districts 1 and 2 belong to the Mangshan Mountains, districts 5, 6, and 7 rely on the Songshan Mountains, the northern part of districts 3 and 5, the southern part of districts 1 and 2, and all of district 4 are located between the Yi and Luo Rivers, called the "Jiahe Beach," which are all in the Yi and Luo River basins. The county seat is located on the north bank of the Yi River, about 5 li from the confluence of the Yi and Luo Rivers, and the terrain is low. (2) Largest mountains and rivers: The largest mountain range in the county is the Songshan Mountains, and the largest river is the Yi and Luo Rivers. They merge south of the city and are still called the Luo River. (3) Reasons for the flood: The Yi River originates in the Wawa Mountains in Henan, flows through Songxian and Yiyang, and enters Yanshi. The Luo River originates in the foothills of the Shaohua Mountains in Shaanxi, flows through Luonan, Lushi, Luoning, and enters Yanshi in the east, merging with the Luo River five li south of the county seat. Due to continuous rain in the upper reaches, mountain floods occurred frequently. The downstream reaches to Gongyi have the Black Stone Pass, with rocks on both sides of the river, and the Longhai Railway bridge crosses north and south. Whenever the river water rises sharply, floating debris blocks the flow excessively. In addition, the Yellow River is silting up and rising at the same time, making it difficult to discharge the water, resulting in accumulated water. In the past, when the Luo and Yi Rivers rose sharply, the counties along the river suffered disasters, with Yanshi being the most severe and the upstream counties being lighter. (4) Period of flooding: It rained heavily on the afternoon of July 7, and the river water rose sharply on the first day of the 8th month. The city dike breached before the hour of Wei, and the entire city was submerged before the hour of Shen. (5) Prior prevention: The county seat is located in a low-lying area. Whenever there are mountain floods and river water rises sharply in the upper reaches, the county seat suffers the most. In the 13th year of Qianlong in the Qing Dynasty, the city collapsed due to water, and dikes were built to protect it after the water subsided. In the 20th year of the Republic of China, the dikes breached, and only the southeastern half of the city was two feet deep in water. In view of the floods in previous years, the dikes were repaired once a year, and half of the soil was piled on the southwest dike to prevent emergencies. This time, on the night of the 7th, the river water rose sharply. The county government immediately summoned the heads of the Zhongshan Town and the heads of various districts, as well as strong men, to carry sandbags, wood, branches, stones, and reeds overnight to protect the dikes, and added earth to build dikes. On the morning of the 8th, the wind and rain intensified, and the water became more urgent. The strong men from Tanghua and Tangquan townships in the north of the city, as well as the police and political police, and the staff of various agencies and merchants, all rose up to rescue the dikes. However, the water flow was turbulent, the rain did not stop, and the northeast dike breached in several places before the hour of Wei. There was no way to rescue the dikes, and a reward of 1,000 yuan was offered, but no one dared to respond. Later, the south dike overflowed, and the west dike also successively issued warnings, collapsing six or seven zhang. At that time, the water inside the dike was more than a foot high, and the situation was dangerous. There was no way to block it. County Magistrate Yang Zhaofang led the people to retreat to the city defense, placing sandbags and soil bags everywhere. Before the end of the hour of Wei, the outer city and city walls outside the east gate were washed down, followed by the south tower, and then the north gate. By the time the west gate was flooded, it was already the hour of Shen. At that time, the water in the four gates was like ten thousand horses galloping, and the entire city was submerged in an instant. (6) Evacuation in case of failure to prevent the flood: When the east gate was flooded, the people were ordered to evacuate through the north gate, but less than three-tenths of them were able to do so. The rest either fled to the north city tower and Wenchang Pavilion, or climbed trees, or squatted on the collapsed rooftops, drifting with the water. The county government personnel retreated to the back building of the county government, and the teachers and students of the education bureau and middle school retreated to the pavilions of the bureau and school. On the morning of the 9th, they made wooden rafts and crossed out of the north gate. (7) Damage to files of the county government and various agencies: The files of the county government were moved to the back building when the city dike breached and overflowed on the 8th. However, there was only one building, and the important ones were stored first. However, before they were finished, the water rushed in and the file room was flooded. The ones stored upstairs were trampled on because there were too many people in distress, causing considerable losses. The files of various agencies were also incomplete. (8) Number of deaths in the whole city and districts: The number of deaths in the city was more than 230, and more than 300 livestock. The remaining bodies that were crushed are being salvaged. The number of deaths in various districts is currently under investigation. (9) Houses submerged in the whole county: 95% of the houses in the city have been submerged, totaling more than 10,000. The various districts are also under investigation. (10) Cultivated land submerged in the whole county: Approximately 2,000 qing. (11) Amount of property loss in the whole county: Approximately more than 4 million. (12) Relocation of the county government and various agencies: The county government is temporarily located in Beiyaocun, about one li north of the city. The future relocation has not yet been determined and a suitable location is being properly discussed. (13) Collapse of city walls: Approximately 800 zhang. (14) After the disaster, the Provincial Relief Association allocated 1,000 yuan and distributed it to the Disaster Relief Committee on a per capita basis, with 20 cents for adults and 10 cents for children. If it was not enough, the number of strong men was reduced. According to Guo Fangwu, a member of the Yuxi Disaster Relief Branch, District Commissioner Sheng of the 10th district convened a water conservancy meeting in the district to raise 4,000 yuan to repair the dikes inside the Luo River and telegraphed 1,000 yuan for emergency relief to Yanshi. The funds have been advanced by the Luoyang Finance Committee and are expected to arrive in Yanshi in two or three days. (15) Most severely affected areas: In addition to Chengguan, the 3rd and 4th districts are the most severely affected, followed by the 1st and 2nd districts, and then the 5th district. Number of affected households in each district: A total of 1,364 households in 14 districts in Chengguan have been affected by the flood. 1,207 households have been accounted for, and 157 households are missing. The other districts are still under investigation. (16) Number of people in each district awaiting relief: The number of disaster victims in Chengguan that have been investigated is more than 12,000, and the other districts are still under investigation. (17) Number of people displaced due to the disaster in each district: Approximately 1% of those affected have moved to Kaifeng, Luoyang, and Zhengzhou, and the rest are still living in safe areas north and south of the county. (18) Area submerged in the whole county: One-half of the area in the 1st, 2nd, and 3rd districts was submerged, all of the 4th district was submerged, and one-third of the 5th district was submerged. Current water situation in the city: The water in Dongguan is more than one zhang deep, the water in Nanguan is about two zhang deep, the water in Beiguan is two or three chi deep, and the water in Xiguan is more than five chi deep. Deaths of personnel of the county government and various agencies: One orderly of the county government, one water pattern observer stationed in Yanshi from the Third Water Conservancy Bureau, four soldiers of the security team, and one sanitation worker of the Public Security Bureau. (19) Damage along the way during the flood: Telephone and telegraph lines, the Yanshi-Dengfeng, Yanshi-Gongyi, and Yanshi-Luoyang county roads were mostly damaged. Current traffic situation: Telephone and telegraph communications have been cut off, and the post office moved to Yaotou Village on the 12th of this month to begin operations. (20) Escape of prisoners in the prison and detention center: A total of 45 prisoners escaped and are being pursued. (21) Regarding epidemic prevention: In addition to the three types of drugs sent by the Provincial Relief Association, which have been distributed separately, the county hospital has been ordered to purchase epidemic prevention drugs and administer epidemic prevention injections.

<h3 id="e93">Gansu Province Continues to Abolish Excessive Levies <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>Abolishing 58 Types of Taxes and Levies Annually Reduces Revenue by Over 110,000 Yuan</p>
<p>Lanzhou Dispatch: Since Mr. Zhu Jingzhou, the Director of the Gansu Provincial Department of Finance, implemented the first phase of abolishing excessive taxes and levies in January of this year, he has been actively engaged in investigations to prepare for the second phase. According to the current investigation results, those taxes and levies that are considered excessive and urgently need to be abolished include 55 types of special consumption taxes, which generate a total annual revenue of 52,831.28 yuan. Additionally, a 10% voluntary donation attached to the tobacco and alcohol tax generates 47,600 yuan. Furthermore, Sichuan leaf cigarettes and tobacco concentrate generate an annual revenue of 10,111 yuan. (The original cigarette inspection fee in Gansu Province was completely abolished at the end of June and replaced with a unified tax. This item refers to Sichuan-produced leaf cigarettes and their raw materials, which are not included in the unified tax reform. Because they are domestic products and belong to handicrafts, a request has been submitted to the provincial government for exemption.) The above three items comprise a total of 58 tax items, with an annual revenue of 110,541.28 yuan. This has been approved by the provincial government and will be fully implemented starting from July 1st of this year. The provincial government has also submitted the matter to the Executive Yuan, the Chairman's Headquarters, and the Ministry of Finance for record-keeping. However, Gansu is inherently a poor province. The first phase abolished excessive levies amounting to over 380,000 yuan, and now another 110,000 yuan has been reduced, making the budget even more insufficient. Mr. Zhu believes that the abolition of excessive levies is of utmost importance to the national economy and people's livelihood, and he has no choice but to implement it despite the difficulties. He hopes that the central government will provide substantial subsidies to alleviate the financial difficulties and to address the detailed process of abolishing excessive levies. At the same time, he has issued orders to all tax bureaus to comply and has also sent letters to chambers of commerce to forward to local chambers of commerce and to inform the citizens. The list of names and tax amounts for the second phase of abolishing excessive levies is as follows:</p>

<p>Jiading: Impoverished and Ill, Taking His Own Life by Drowning</p>
<p>On June 21st, the Jiaxiang Steamboat was sailing near Shitumeng when, at dusk, a passenger suddenly jumped into the river. Rescue efforts were unsuccessful. The next morning, the body surfaced, but no one claimed it. After investigation by the county government, it was confirmed that the deceased had drowned himself. A coffin was provided by the local government for burial in the public cemetery. On the 26th, the deceased's son inquired at the steamboat company about the situation and identified a straw hat left behind as belonging to his father. He stated that his father had taken his own life by drowning due to poverty and illness, which prevented him from working.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Public Security Bureau Cracks Down on a Major Den</p>
<p>In Beimaopeng, Huishan, in this county, there is a Juesheng Temple, also known as Qilü Chan Forest or Maomiao Temple. The temple is located in a secluded area, comprising about thirty rooms. It has seven or eight monks and flourishing incense offerings. The abbot, named Yingru, is over forty years old and specializes in committing adultery and other crimes. He colludes with the lay monk Changhe in the temple, engaging in all sorts of evil deeds. They have a secret room and underground chamber in the temple, equipped with opium pipes, where they gather to gamble. Women with attractive appearances who come to burn incense and pray are seduced into the room and raped, sometimes even by violent means. Recently, a guest monk named Zhirun secretly reported the situation to the Public Security Bureau, stating that the monk Yingru also went to the Huishan area at night to exhume graves and steal coffins. The bureau dispatched inspector Ge Xinde, clerk Chen Zhongshou, and a large number of police officers, accompanied by Zhilun, on a roundabout route up the mountain on a dark night. Zhirun called open the back door of the temple, and the police rushed in. In the abbot's room, they pushed open a wooden wall and entered a secret room, where the monks Changhe, Zhiyin, and Shuchun from neighboring temples were gambling. They were immediately captured and a set of dominoes was confiscated. Then they went to the station room, where a servant climbed through a food delivery hole and confiscated opium pipes and other items. Later, they discovered a richly decorated secret room, entered it, and apprehended the monk Yingru. They also found qipaos, women's silk shoes, face powder, opium paste, and opium paraphernalia. Finally, they discovered an underground chamber under a movable floor in the room, where a middle-aged woman was found naked and asleep on a couch. She was also arrested and identified herself as Jiang Wenzhen (also known as Miss Jin). She readily admitted to having an affair with the monk. After the police finished searching, they took Yingru, Changhe, Zhiyin, and Jiang Wenzhen, along with the evidence, to the bureau. The monk Shuchun was left to guard the temple gate and was not taken to the bureau. Later, section member Zhang from the third section of the Public Security Bureau conducted a preliminary hearing. The defendants' testimonies were cunning, and it was decided to submit the case to the county government for further investigation and handling.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Riverbank Collapses Again for Over 110 Zhang</p>
<p>Recently, the riverbank in Liuwei has been collapsing frequently due to the rising tide. At 3:00 AM on the 25th, the east end of Liuwei collapsed again for over 110 zhang, causing the ferry boat of the Zhenyang Pujun Ferry, which was docked there, to drift away with the waves. Staff from the ferry office worked overnight to find it with a charitable ferry boat and finally found it near the Doutian Temple at dawn. Therefore, to avoid danger to passengers, the Pujun Ferry Bureau has temporarily suspended ticket sales for Liuwei.</p>
<p>Nantong: Expansion of the Fourth Prison Implemented</p>
<p>The Jiangsu Fourth Prison in Tongcheng, which houses male and female offenders sentenced to more than three years from Tongruhai counties, is expanding its prison cells to accommodate a large number of prisoners who will be transferred from the Suzhou Third Sub-prison. The expansion has been approved by the High Court.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Zhegan Railway Extends to Shangrao</p>
<p>The track-laying project for the Nanyu section of the Zhegan Railway was only four kilometers away from Shangrao yesterday. It is expected to be completed today (the 28th). A trial run is planned for tonight, and ticket sales will officially begin on August 1st. Passenger trains between Hangzhou and Yushan will directly reach Shangrao, with daily round trips in both directions, providing convenience for travelers.</p>
<p>Safety Measures for Qianjiang Pier</p>
<p>The plum blossom piles at the Yidu Pier on the north and south banks of the Qiantang River have been hollowed out by saltwater and shipworms and are collapsing. Those that have not yet collapsed are also quite dangerous. The Department of Construction, recognizing the Qiantang River as a vital transportation hub between eastern and western Zhejiang, convened a meeting of relevant agencies to discuss rescue measures. Recognizing that any accident at the Qiantang River pier would have a significant impact on traveler safety, it was decided to notify vehicles to temporarily cease operations to prevent danger. The Water Conservancy Bureau will formulate two types of safety measures: temporary and permanent. Six iron anchors, each weighing approximately two tons, will be purchased from Shanghai and placed at the two north and south piers to temporarily maintain safety. After the autumn tide, two pairs of reinforced concrete pillars will be built to ensure permanent safety.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Municipal Chamber of Commerce Announcement: Loan Application Forms Begin to Be Issued; Industry and Commerce Revival Committee Handles; Ministry of Finance Explains Mortgage Loans <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee sent a letter to the Cloth Chamber of Commerce for distribution, stating that it would produce application forms for small industrial and commercial credit loans. The Chamber of Commerce has decided to handle it through the Industry and Commerce Revival Committee and will begin issuing them starting on the 29th. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has notified all members and announced the matter to all factories and firms in the city. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter from the Loan Committee: The Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee sent a letter to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday, stating, "Regarding the 5 million yuan small credit loan to assist industry and commerce in Shanghai, the Ministry of Finance previously ordered this committee to review and release the loans. Active preparations have been made and the fourth meeting of this committee resolved to send the credit loan application forms, etc., to the municipal chamber of commerce for distribution to the various trade associations, for applicants in each industry to fill out and submit to this committee for investigation and review. Factories and firms that are not members of trade associations may also obtain application forms from the municipal chamber of commerce, fill them out, and submit them to this committee for review. The above loan has been resolved at the sixth meeting of this committee on the 22nd of this month and is scheduled to begin lending on August 1st. We are sending three thousand copies of the application forms and accompanying form instructions printed by this committee in advance for your review, collection, and distribution. If it is insufficient, please notify this committee at any time for further delivery. If necessary regarding the procedures for filling out the application form, this committee will assign specialists to reside in your committee to guide and explain to the applicants. We hope you will take note of this."</p>
<p>Starting Tomorrow: After receiving the documents from the Industry and Commerce Loan Committee on the 27th, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce immediately notified all members and issued a public notice. However, because the procedures for filling out the application form still require the committee to send personnel to instruct, and all procedures must be prepared, it was decided to start collecting from the Industry and Commerce Revival Committee starting on the 29th of this month, i.e., next Monday, and Wang Yansong, the director of the Revival Committee, will publicly instruct in the Chamber of Commerce assembly hall at 9:00 AM on the 29th.</p>
<p>Chamber of Commerce Announcement: The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce hereby announces the matter of collecting blank application forms for small credit loans. The Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee is undertaking the matter of small credit loans to assist industry and commerce in Shanghai. The committee has prepared all the application forms and forms that applicants should fill out and has transferred them to this committee. All industrial and commercial enterprises in this city who wish to apply for a small credit loan can go directly to the Revival Industry and Commerce Committee attached to the second floor of this committee to collect the blank forms and report in the prescribed format. The time for going to the committee to collect the forms is from 9:00 AM to 5:00 PM every day except holidays. This announcement.</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Interpretation: The Chamber of Commerce previously requested the Ministry of Finance to explain whether the procedure for loans to assist industry and commerce, which are released by various banks and firms, needs special procedures or is no different from mortgage loans. The Ministry of Finance replied with document Qian Zi No. 6421, stating that the review and approval of small industrial and commercial credit loans should be reported to the Loan Committee, and the lending industry should refer to Article 1 of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Loan Detailed Rules approved by the committee and submitted to the Ministry for approval. Although mortgage loans are lent by various banks and firms, Article 2 of the Loan Detailed Rules stipulates that after this loan is reviewed and approved by the committee, the committee will issue treasury bonds as a second guarantee for the loan amount, and Article 7 of the Ministry's Lending Principles stipulates that the monthly interest rate for bank loans to assist industry and commerce shall not exceed eight percent. If the situation of the factory or firm cannot bear the full monthly interest rate, it may request the Ministry to approve a subsidy of two percent monthly interest, etc. Therefore, since the committee issues treasury bonds as a second guarantee for this mortgage loan and can request approval to subsidize the monthly interest rate, it is obviously different from ordinary mortgage loans. Applicants can request to follow the rules promulgated by the Ministry for monthly interest, and it cannot be said that there is no basis. Please note.</p>

<p>The newly appointed Dutch envoy to China, Baron Transde, originally scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 15th of this month, then postponed his arrival to the 27th due to a brief stay in the Dutch East Indies. According to news from the Dutch Consulate in Shanghai this morning, the Dutch Consul in Shanghai, Mr. Helongmen, recently received a telegram from Mr. Fu, informing him that Mr. Fu's arrival in China has been postponed again to August 10th, arriving in Shanghai on the Chichakana of the Zhahua Shipping Company. The reason for the repeated postponements is that Mr. Fu learned on his way to China that Chairman Lin of our National Government is currently vacationing in Lushan, so he decided to stay longer in the East Indies and delay his arrival in China. Mr. Fu plans to arrive in Shanghai on the 10th and will not immediately enter the capital. After Chairman Lin approves the date for presenting his credentials, he will enter the capital to meet with him and present his credentials.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Yu Qiaqing Resigns from Two Positions: Resigns as Chairman of the Association and Standing Director of the Cooperative <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Mr. Yu Qiaqing, a leader in the shipping industry, has sent letters resigning from his positions as Chairman of the Shanghai Steamboat Industry Association and Standing Director of the China Shipping Cooperative. The original text of the resignation letters is as follows:</p>
<p>Letter Resigning from Chairman of the Association: Since the Shanghai Shipping Association was reorganized into the Shipping Industry Association and renamed the Steamboat Industry Association, I have been honored to be elected by my colleagues to preside over the association's affairs for eight years. This year, the China Shipping Cooperative was established, and I was again elected as a non-governmental director. I did not dare to decline because the matter was voluntary and concerned my personal interests. Our country's shipping industry is known to be immature. Over the years, although the number of ships has gradually increased on the surface, the actual business has been declining. Recently, due to the decline of rural areas and the urgency of finance, the shipping industry has reached a dead end. As a leader in the non-governmental shipping industry, I feel obliged to help others, seek relief on the one hand, and seek survival on the other. This is not the time for me to decline in this critical moment of survival. However, since the China Merchants Group was nationalized and withdrew from the association, there has been an additional layer of relations. Although the government authorities have made every effort to appeal, they have not received practical benefits. Shipping colleagues have also failed to understand the difficulties. The establishment of the Shipping Administration Bureau was originally advocated by shipping merchants, and the revival of the Merchant Marine School was also agreed upon by shipping merchants, who observed the increase of a three percent ton banknote surcharge. Even these two things have been criticized as self-inflicted. The shipping cooperative is the only way to save ourselves at present and is fully endorsed by me and my colleagues. However, after designing and preparing for nearly a year, it has not yet been realized. After careful analysis, it is because the situation is not both ways and there are different views. If you are not careful, you will be used by others. In this situation, I have neither won the sympathy of the government nor met the expectations of my colleagues. I feel very panic. If this continues, there is no way to proceed. After repeated thinking, I have no choice but to give way to the virtuous and express my sincerity. I hope you will understand. Sincerely, Yu Hede, July 24, 24th year.</p>
<p>Letter Resigning from the Cooperative: Since the establishment of our cooperative, three months have passed. I was honored to be elected as a standing director. However, for the past three months, there have been no concrete measures. If this continues, I feel ashamed of my colleagues. I have already resigned from my position as a standing committee member and chairman of the Steamboat Industry Association. I should also resign from my position as a standing director and director of this cooperative. I hereby send this letter to request your approval and elect a capable person. To the China Shipping Cooperative, Yu Hede, July 14, 24th year.</p>

<p>The Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Railways yesterday, stating that according to a case presented by the Ministry's Business Department, the 22nd proposal of the 9th National Railway Transportation Conference, proposed by the Ping-Sui Railway, concerned "regulations on the handling of original tickets after passengers traveling beyond their designated station or class have supplemented their tickets," and the 24th proposal, proposed by the Hunan-Hubei Railway, concerned "whether or not passenger tickets should be returned to passengers after they have supplemented their tickets on board," and the 23rd proposal, proposed by the Tianjin-Pukou Railway, concerned "requesting regulations on ticket supplementation methods." These thirteen cases were discussed together, and the conference resolved in the 105th resolution that (1) For passengers traveling beyond their designated station, in addition to supplementing their tickets or supplementing their tickets and being fined in accordance with Article 47 of the Passenger Transport Regulations, the original tickets should be uniformly collected, and the following statement should be noted in the first copy of the supplement: "Ticket No. [number] of [class] from [station] to [station] has been collected."

<p>The Central Factory Inspection Bureau, in order to raise awareness of hygiene and safety in factories throughout the country, plans to hold a large-scale factory safety and hygiene exhibition in Nanjing, and has sent letters to the Shanghai Industrial Safety Association and the United Association of Machine-Made National Products Factories soliciting exhibits. According to a report from a Guomin News Agency reporter, the exhibition period has been extended to September 15th due to the fact that not all exhibits have been transported to Nanjing. It is also understood that the factory safety film produced by the Central Factory Inspection Bureau is now mostly completed, and the entire film is expected to be completed next month. After completion, it will be transported to factories in various locations for screening.</p>
<h3 id="e102">Macgen Road Depot Extends Free Storage Period <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>The free storage period for goods at various stations of the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways was originally set at seven days for incoming goods and three days for outgoing goods. However, the Macgen Road Depot, due to previous congestion, had reduced the storage period for incoming goods from seven days to five days, while the storage period for outgoing goods remained at three days. At the same time, the storage fees for all types of goods of the fourth class and below were uniformly charged at the third-class storage fee rate to restrict storage. Now, the Traffic Department, due to the poor soybean harvest this year, has found that incoming goods at the depot are not very active, and all warehouses have vacancies. With the approval of the bureau, starting from August, the free storage period for incoming goods at the Macgen Road Depot will be temporarily extended to seven days, and the storage fees for the fourth class and below will continue to be charged at the original rates to attract more business.</p>
<h3 id="e103">Labor Dispute at Huachang Coir Fiber Factory: Misunderstanding Leads to Assault on Workers <a href="#e103" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c103" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">103</a></h3>
<p>Dagong News Agency reports that since the Huachang Coir Fiber Factory in Pudong, Shanghai, suspended its film department operations, it has sparked a backlash from the factory's workers. The Shanghai Coir Fiber Workers' Union petitioned the party and government authorities for relief. The Municipal Social Affairs Bureau approved the resumption of work as usual, but the factory refused to accept it, and the two sides were deadlocked. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning (the 27th) at around 9:00 AM, a large team of over 40 police officers, led by Inspector He of the Tangqiao Police Station, forcibly shipped out goods. Simultaneously, the factory sent staff member Xu Zukang to the Coir Fiber Workers' Union to request that people be sent to ship the goods. The union's executive director Ji Hao led more than ten warehouse workers to unload the goods at the factory, but they were assaulted by the police, including union director Ji Hao and workers Wang Jinrong, Shao Tianzhong, Zhu Jinde, Xu Ashun, Weng Zenghua, Qu Zucheng, Sun Acheng, He Jusheng, Wang Jinfu, and Ma Fulin, among others. Ji Hao and Wang Jinrong suffered the most severe injuries. After receiving the report, the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the Shanghai Federation of Trade Unions, considering the seriousness of the situation, dispatched Wang Renwu of the Social Affairs Bureau's Mediation Division and Wan Banghe, a cadre of the Federation of Trade Unions, to Pudong to investigate. In addition to immediately sending the injured workers to Nanyang Hospital for treatment, they will schedule a formal mediation. The Federation of Trade Unions will also convene an emergency meeting to discuss assistance and mediation measures.</p>

<p>Regarding the "Mainichi Shimbun's" publication of Mr. Takashima Shifuku's remarks on the 26th, the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai believe that the newspaper used careless language, which not only had a negative impact on international politics and the unification of Japanese public opinion but also damaged the reputation of the Japanese Army and Navy. Yesterday, they specifically expressed their apology in the same location, and there were comments denouncing Takashima as a traitor.</p>

<p>Xu Shiying telegraphed Shanghai, reporting on the inspection of the Jiangxi disaster: "Wang Yilao and I respectfully ask for your understanding. I respectfully accepted your repeated telegrams inviting me to inspect the disaster. I left Hunan late last night and arrived in Hubei at noon today. I have somewhat discussed the relief plan with Chairman Zhang and Director He. I immediately boarded the Jianghua ship and arrived in Xun [Jiujiang] the next day. The floodwaters in the urban area have gradually receded, and epidemic prevention is extremely important. The Yangtze River is relatively stable, but the dikes of the inland lakes north of the river are collapsing due to the backflow of water from the breach in the Mahua Dike. The northerly wind has been quite noticeable in recent days. The Hengmian Dike of the Chugong Dike in Jiujiang County is particularly precarious. Within the dike are tens of thousands of acres of farmland, with agricultural products worth at least two million yuan, and the harvest is imminent. If it collapses, it will have a significant impact on Xunshi [Jiujiang] trade. Director Yan of the Jiangxi Water Conservancy Bureau is working day and night to reinforce the dikes, with the support of Chairman Xiong. I transferred to Nanchang in the evening and arrived at Chou [1-3 AM], where I discussed everything with Chairman Xiong. This morning, I took a boat to inspect the disaster situation in Duyang and other counties. I departed from Xun [Jiujiang] today to rush back to the capital on the day of Jian [August 1st] to present a general overview and prepare a report for submission as soon as possible, in order to facilitate overall planning. Furthermore, the Central Disaster Relief Reserve Fund Management Committee will formally be established on the 30th. I respectfully submit this telegram. Your brother, Bi Ying, bows. Youmao [5-7 AM] sees five."</p>
<p>The Righteous Disaster Relief Association of Various Provinces recently received a respectful telegram from the Henan Flood Relief Headquarters and the Henan Relief Affairs Association, stating, "We have been suffering from disasters for years and have repeatedly received your donations, which have saved the lives of disaster victims. This year's spring harvest was a complete failure, and recently heavy rains have caused the Yellow River and other rivers to breach their banks, inundating the autumn harvest in more than 20 counties, including Yanfeng. Hundreds of thousands of starving people are exposed to the wind and eat in the open, on the verge of death. Your association has a charitable heart. We sincerely request you to generously donate large sums of money for relief. We are endlessly grateful." Hearing of this tragic disaster, the association is currently trying to raise relief funds, and will appropriately handle the distribution when a certain amount is raised.</p>
<p>The Joint Office of the Southeastern Branches of the Red Swastika Society received a telegram from the Southeastern Headquarters in Nanjing yesterday, appealing for disaster relief. (Omitted above) "Our society, in view of the severe flood disaster in Hubei Province, has joined with various societies to organize a relief team to first raise relief funds and medicines to distribute for urgent relief. We hope that your society will unite to raise funds and assign personnel for cooperation. Please be aware that disaster relief is valuable for its urgency. Relief funds are not about quantity; one yuan can save a person's life. We hope that you will advocate and raise relief funds as soon as possible to save the victims of the disaster. Please reply to us promptly regarding your plans. We are extremely eager to await your orders." Furthermore, a telegram was received from the headquarters reporting that the relief team has arrived in Shandong and is proceeding to Juye, Yuncheng, Jiaxiang, and other counties. The entire city is flooded, and the water level in Jinjia and other areas has recently risen again. The Yellow River mouth between Zhen and Yuncheng is being investigated and urgently relieved. Due to the vastness of the disaster area, there are insufficient teams to allocate. More relief team members have been dispatched from Jinan to be divided into districts for relief. However, the roads are muddy, and cars cannot pass. They must first go to Jining and then hire small cars or boats to detour. The roads are obstructed, and it will take three days to reach the disaster area. It is reported that after receiving the telegram, the office has scheduled an emergency meeting for yesterday to discuss relief measures.</p>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society recently received telegrams from Xiangyang and Fancheng counties in Hubei, stating, "During the summer flood season this year, continuous rain has caused a disaster. Floods have erupted and spread endlessly. The Yangtze and Han rivers have risen simultaneously, and the dikes along the banks have all collapsed. In particular, Fancheng and Xiangyang in the upper reaches of the Han River have suffered complete inundation, with water levels rising ten feet. People have become fish, and the areas of Hanmian and Qianjiang have been turned into swamps. The rapid currents have swept away residents who were unable to escape, and an estimated tens of thousands have died. Corpses are floating everywhere, a sight too unbearable to witness. The situation is extremely tragic. Wuhan, located at the confluence of the two rivers, has already seen the effects of the disaster. The original dikes are all in imminent danger, and people are working day and night to prevent them from collapsing, hoping to escape danger. However, the disaster is extremely severe, surpassing even the disaster of 20 years ago. The disaster victims are unable to save themselves. We earnestly request all of you to have compassion and provide generous relief, either by allocating public funds or donating from your private pockets, to provide urgent relief. We appeal in unison, with utmost urgency," etc. The report of the submersion of Yanshi County in Henan has just arrived, and now Xiangyang and Fancheng counties in Hubei have suffered complete inundation. Although the disaster conditions in other provinces such as Hunan, Anhui, Shandong, and Jiangsu may differ, the consecutive years of disasters and droughts have left ten households with nine empty. Now, they have been flooded again, and some counties have suffered complete inundation. The heart aches when writing about it, and the situation is indescribable. We only hope that compassionate and virtuous people at home and abroad will rise up and provide immediate relief, so that they will not all fill the gullies.</p>
<p>The Hubei Provincial Association in Shanghai received a reply telegram from the Relief Affairs Committee yesterday, which stated, "To Chairman Guan Wang and Vice Chairmen Liu of the Hubei Provincial Association in Shanghai: We have received your telegram and learned of the severe flood disaster in your province. We are deeply saddened. According to previous reports, we have telegraphed the Hubei Provincial Government, the Hubei Provincial Relief Affairs Committee, and the Hubei Provincial Flood Relief Headquarters to promptly report the area and losses in all disaster areas in detail for verification. The request has been approved. In addition to further urging them to facilitate overall planning, we are replying by telegram for your information." The Relief Affairs Committee, and also received a reply letter from the World Red Swastika Society, which stated, "Dear Sirs: We received your letter yesterday, along with a telegram from the Hankou Chamber of Commerce. We respectfully learned that your province has suffered a severe flood disaster. We previously received urgent telegrams from Mr. He Hengfu and Mr. Huang Wenzhi of the Wuhan Joint Office of our society, and we immediately remitted 1,000 yuan to provide urgent relief and telegraphed the branches in Marukiang, Anqing, Wuhu, and Datong to salvage the floating corpses of those drowned in Tianmen and Gucheng counties. The Nanjing branch sent a team to Hubei for relief, and we telegraphed our headquarters and sent circulars to branches throughout the country, urging them to donate. We are replying with this special letter for your information." Signed by the United General Office of the Southeast Branches of the World Red Swastika Society.</p>

It has been investigated that on the highway bridge section from Kunshan to Qingyang Port, rickshaws are already operating. The one-way fare is 30 cents per wheel, and it takes half an hour to reach. Passengers traveling from Kunshan to the Lianglu Garden Hotel can travel to the bridge bank as described above, and then travel south for about a mile through the countryside, or call ahead and the hotel will send a yacht (gasoline boat for groups) to pick them up at the bridge bank. The Kunshan County Government plans to build a branch road from the Qingyang Port highway bridge to the Garden Hotel to facilitate travel, and is currently surveying the route.</p>
<h3 id="e108">Raven Submits a Response to the U.S. Court <a href="#e108" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c108" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">108</a></h3>
<p>The "North China Daily News" reports that Mr. He Fu, the liquidator of the U.S. Feng Bank and other three companies, previously filed a petition with the U.S. Court in China on June 29th, seeking to recover from Mr. Raven, the manager of the former U.S. Feng Bank, Meidong Bank, Puyi Real Estate Company, and Puyi Bank, the bonuses granted by the U.S. Feng Bank, Meidong Bank, and Puyi Real Estate Company in January 1932, totaling 405,000 taels of silver. Yesterday afternoon (the 26th), Mr. Raven submitted a response to the U.S. Court. The main points are as follows: The defendant admits that he has owned and managed a large portion of the voting capital of Puyi Bank for the past five years and admits that Puyi Bank currently owns and manages a large portion of the voting capital of Meidong Bank. Meidong Bank, in turn, has owned and managed a large portion of the voting capital of the U.S. Feng Bank for the past five years and is doing so currently. However, the defendant denies ever managing the bank during any period in the past five years. On January 12, 1932, the bank's assets exceeded its liabilities by more than twice the amount, excluding capital surplus and undistributed dividends. At that time, the cash on hand and the cash deposited in various banks accounted for approximately 44% of the deposits received. At that time and for some time thereafter, the price of its stock in the Shanghai market rose to more than twice its original value. The defendant denies that he was managing the bank on January 12, 1932. As for the bank's directors, they were elected by the shareholders at any time and were able to independently decide everything, without being directly or indirectly controlled by the defendant in any way. When the board of directors passed the resolution on bonuses, the defendant attended the meeting at the beginning, but he did not know that the issue was being considered beforehand. The defendant did not apply for this bonus, and he only learned of the resolution after the meeting was over. The defendant later paid 135,000 taels of this bonus into Puyi Bank to increase its working capital. At that time and thereafter, the defendant never used this money for his personal benefit. The defendant admits to withdrawing money from the bank, but this was for public expenses, not salaries. The bank was established in 1917, and the defendant was the initiator and organizer. However, the defendant never received any remuneration from the bank for his efforts in initiating and organizing it, either at that time or at any time before 1932. The defendant was an employee of the bank and was the organizer of the bank's affairs. He worked diligently and carefully for about ten years and received no other remuneration except for the aforementioned 135,000 taels. It is reasonable for the board of directors to reward him with this amount. Now, after a lapse of more than three years, he is suddenly ordered to repay this amount. This is simply unreasonable. At the end of the letter, it is stated that the defendant had told the plaintiff that he would not leave China until all matters were settled, as doing so would be misunderstood. However, the plaintiff filed a petition with the court to prevent the defendant from leaving China. The notice was served just ten minutes before midnight on June 29th. This kind of behavior is crude, oppressive, and violates all the rights of the plaintiff. Therefore, he asks the court to cancel the plaintiff's lawsuit and withdraw the order preventing the defendant from leaving China. The plaintiff should pay the litigation costs. The defendant has the right to take action or be advised to take action against the plaintiff for his unwarranted prevention from leaving China and to demand compensation for losses.</p>
<p>The wording of the responses regarding the Meidong Bank and Puyi Real Estate Company cases is the same as that of the U.S. Feng Bank case. However, the defendant stated that the bonus of 135,000 taels for Meidong Bank was fully refunded in 1933. He did this not because he had any obligation, but because the board of directors of Meidong Bank had passed a resolution accepting it at the time.</p>

These four ships are the newest of the inland ships, with complete equipment. When sailing on the Shanghai-Qingdao line and the Shanghai-Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangdong line, the special and first-class passenger cabins are always fully booked. The fares from Shanghai to Hong Kong are 50 yuan for special class, 24 yuan for first class, 17 yuan for second class, 9.50 yuan for third class, and 7.60 yuan for fourth class. Drinks are not charged extra.</p>
<p>Shortening Sailing Time and Increasing Service: General Manager Liu Hongsheng, to facilitate passengers on the Shanghai-Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangdong line, has decided to shorten the sailing time and increase the number of services. It has now been decided that three ships will sail from Shanghai each week, with the round-trip sailing time shortened to 12 days. The Yuanheng, Lizhen, and Anxing ships will be designated, as well as five other ships, while the Haiyi ship sailing on the Shanghai-Haiphong line will also sell Shantou-Hong Kong-Guangdong passenger tickets. It was originally scheduled to be implemented in August, but due to insufficient preparation, it has been changed to September.</p>

<p>The Bao Feng steamer, operated by Jufeng Company on the Chongming-Shanghai route, arrived at Antou Port at 8:25 AM on the 25th of this month. Due to the severe storm, the shipowner, fearing an accident, immediately dropped anchor. However, due to the strong wind and turbulent waters, the anchor chain broke in two sections, and a "God of Immortals" anchor, weighing fifteen hundredweight, also fell into the port. The total value of the anchor and chain was substantial. At that time, the water depth in the port was thirteen feet. Crew members were immediately dispatched to salvage the anchor, working for six and a half hours from 8:30 AM until the tide rose at 3:00 PM, but they were unable to recover it. At 3:15 PM, the Bao Feng steamer sailed back to Shanghai. The shipowner left a second mate in Antou Port to salvage the anchor. Upon the ship's return to Shanghai, the shipowner, Xue Jinlong, reported the incident to the company, which in turn notified the insurance company to send someone to inspect the lost anchor and proceed with the salvage operation.</p>

<p>Since the closure of the Hua Ying Pharmacy in this city, the liquidation results show that assets and liabilities can offset each other. However, the company's property mainly consists of medicines and raw materials for Western medicine. If they are auctioned off at reduced prices, creditors will suffer even greater losses. Therefore, the liquidators, Zhang Shizhao and Yuan Xingyun, lawyers, and Qin Kai, accountant, prepared a reconciliation plan and applied to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for trial commercial reconciliation. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce accepted the application and appointed Yu Zuoting, Jin Runxiang, and Ma Shaoquan as three committee members to handle the matter. It is now heard that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce has scheduled a meeting of creditors of the pharmacy for 2:00 PM on the 11th of next month. The notice is as follows: "According to a letter from the liquidators of the Huamei Pharmacy in this city, lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Yuan Xingyun, and accountant Qin Kai, stating that the pharmacy was closed due to the impact of the economic downturn, and that it is impossible to dispose of the excessive inventory. If this is delayed for a long time, creditors may suffer too much loss. Therefore, a reconciliation plan has been prepared and the Chamber is requested to convene a meeting of creditors to try to negotiate a reconciliation, etc. The 53rd Standing Committee meeting of this Chamber has resolved to pass it. It is now scheduled to convene a meeting of creditors at this Chamber at 2:00 PM on the afternoon of August 11 to try to implement reconciliation measures. All creditors of the pharmacy must bring their creditor's certificates and attend the meeting on time to discuss the matter."</p>

<p>Xing Zhigang, the chief of the fifth district of Shanghai County, believes that Chenxing, Tangkou, and Tiqiao Towns are interwoven areas of Shangnan and Shanghai counties, and that telephone communication between the two counties is particularly important. Previously, the central Hezhen Town of Nan County was connected to the northern part, bypassing the Sanshanlintang area and directly reaching the Yangsi urban area. Now, in the southern part, together with the sixth district of Nan County, a section of telephone line has been laid to Dujiahang Town, and communication has been completed. Yesterday, he submitted a document to the Shanghai County Government requesting that the Nanhui County Government put it on file. The document stated: "I have previously jointly discussed with the sixth district office of Nanhui County the construction of a telephone line from Chenxing Town in my district to Duhang Town in the sixth district of Nan County, in order to promote Shangnan telecommunications, connect transportation, and benefit local business development. The consent of ten local gentlemen was obtained, and former County Magistrate Pan Xu was also in favor. Funds were immediately raised for the construction, and the project has now been completed. However, the towns south of Duhang Town are all within the jurisdiction of Nan County, and the telephone services in each town are managed by the Nanhui County Construction Section. Now that it has been connected to my district, it is necessary to first consult the Nanhui County Government for filing in order to comply with the procedures. Therefore, a special document is submitted to you, my superior, humbly requesting approval to consult the Nanhui County Government for filing in order to facilitate communication and benefit the local area. This is truly for the public good."</p>

<h3 id="e124">Takahashi Seaside Bathing Resort Grand Event: Xingye Society Hosted Over 200 Chinese and Western Guests Yesterday <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Takahashi Seaside Bathing Resort, this year taken back by the Municipal Government and handed over to the Xingye Trust Company for management, has been extensively renovated and refurbished by the company. Since its opening, it has attracted a considerable number of visitors. Yesterday, the company invited reporters from various Chinese and Western newspapers in Shanghai and personnel from various shipping companies to visit. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>A Glimpse Along the Way: Yesterday, over two hundred Chinese and foreign news reporters and personnel from various shipping companies, led by the company's General Manager Xu Fu, Manager Tan Boying, Deputy Manager Zhou Xin, and other staff members, were warmly received. A newly built No. 6 wave-breaking ferry was specially prepared for the guests. The structure and equipment of this ferry are generally similar to the No. 5 ferry, but its materials are more robust and its decoration is more luxurious than the No. 5 ferry. Its top speed can reach thirteen nautical miles, surpassing all other ferries. At 2:30 PM, the ferry departed from the Beijing Road Pier. As soon as it set sail, a refreshing coolness was immediately felt, and the sweltering heat completely dissipated. No wonder the night ferries are crowded with people seeking relief from the heat. Even in the hottest weather, when there is not even a slight breeze in gardens or open fields, a cool breeze naturally arises as soon as the ferry sets sail. After passing Qingning Temple, the air became even clearer. The fields on both sides were boundless and green, and the sandpipers and sailboats created a picturesque scene. The reporters either tapped on the railings and sang loudly or sat around chatting, full of interest. After about an hour, they arrived at Takahashi, where ten buses were already lined up at the pier waiting. These vehicles had large bodies, freshly painted, and unusually comfortable spring seats. The road was also smoother than in previous years. In about ten minutes, they reached the bathing resort.</p>
<p>A Tour of the Bathing Resort: After entering the resort, they first visited it separately. The structure of the buildings in the resort is quite unique, with green tile roofs, whitewashed walls, and supporting vermilion pillars, creating a dazzling array of colors. At the north end are two large dressing rooms for men and women, each with clothing lockers, changing rooms, shower rooms, and the like. Male and female staff members separately rent out various swimming supplies, bathrobes, towels, and other items. In the middle is the office, and at the south end is the dining hall, which is a branch of the Lakeside Restaurant, selling high-quality Western dishes and famous Yangzhou snacks. In front of the dining hall is a large lawn, also filled with tables and chairs for guests to dine. Next to the lawn is a Mongolian yurt, with a cold drink stand inside, selling various cold drinks for tourists to purchase nearby. Short stools are arranged in three circles around the cold drink stand for tourists to rest. Further south is the tent rental area, with hundreds of tents available for rent. Behind the tents is a grassy area of several acres, covering more than 300 square meters, with green turf like a carpet. After bathing in the sea, tourists often come to the lawn for sunbathing. Behind the lawn are cool houses where people can stay. In addition, there are several pavilions for resting. At that time, many tourists were already swimming in the sea. The beach here is shallow and flat, making it a very suitable seaside bathing resort. Now, with the addition of modern facilities and scientific management, arranged in an orderly manner, it can add another glorious page to the history of municipal construction. After the tour, the receptionists politely led the guests into the dining hall for refreshments. The refreshments were homemade by the Lakeside Restaurant, both Chinese and Western, exquisite and delicious. Some of the guests who enjoyed swimming changed clothes and entered the water for swimming and bathing. Around 5 PM, they all boarded the original ship and returned to Shanghai, arriving when the city was already illuminated by thousands of lights.</p>
<p>Additional Notes on the Trip: To facilitate visits to Takahashi Seaside Bathing Resort by employed people on non-holidays, the Municipal Ferry has added special return trips every day. "Outbound" ferries depart every hour from 7 AM to 7 PM, departing from the Beijing Road Pier on the hour. "Return" trips, in addition to the original schedule, will also include a special return trip from Takahashi at 10 PM, arriving at the Beijing Road Pier at 11 PM, or taking the cool night ferry, arriving in Shanghai at 12:30 AM, rain or shine.</p>

<h3 id="e126">Yongqing Lane Tragedy: Continued Hearing of Two Lawsuits: Both Cases Show Hope of Reconciliation; Judge Advises Against Extraneous Actions <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The Great China Celluloid Manufacturing Factory on Xiaoshadu Road in western Shanghai has had a tragic incident on the night of the 28th of last month. Residents of Yongqing Lane who suffered formed a support association and hired lawyers Wang Xianggu, Wei Weiqing, Sun Bawu, Zhang Zhu, and Tao Gan as legal advisors to negotiate with the factory and represent forty relatives of the victims, including Wu Shaowen, to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing the factory manager Jiang Junyan, factory director Ge Tianmin, Qian Menglin, general manager Sun Hongcheng, chairman Zhu Rutang, and other five people of committing crimes of public danger. The court has</p>
<p>Once Summoned [them] and Ordered a Postponement: The details have been repeatedly reported in this newspaper. However, since this case occurred, the victims, because their houses were burned and they had nowhere to live, temporarily lived in the factory, quietly waiting for a legal resolution. Unexpectedly, on the 10th of this month, the victims, due to a misunderstanding, clashed with the factory again, leading to arguments. At that time, many people on the victims' side were seriously injured, including Xu Yucheng, Zhang Du's wife, Zhao Zhang's wife, Li Wu's wife, Chen Chen's wife, Huang You's wife, Yan Hu's wife, Zhu Xiaomao, Guan Zhou's wife, Feng Wang's wife, Zhang Wang's wife, Xia Lu's wife, Zhu Yan's wife, Yan Zhu's wife, Zhou Zicai, Liu Shitong, Zhou Zemin, Zhang Chu's wife, Zhang Xiaomei, and other nineteen men and women,</p>
<p>First Went to Court and the Procuratorate to Examine Injuries: At the same time, the support association's legal advisors, on behalf of the victims, filed another complaint with the Special Court, accusing the factory chairman Zhu Rutang and former factory director Qian Menglin of assault. This case was heard yesterday morning at 11:10 AM by Judge Zhan Liangce in the Second Criminal Court. All fifteen plaintiffs were present in court, and the Public Concession police authorities, for the sake of maintaining order, still ordered a large number of Chinese and Western detectives from the Huizi Police Station to attend the court together with court police to</p>
<p>Maintain Order: The defendant Zhu Rutang did not appear and hired lawyers Xu Jie and Gu Yongquan to defend him. They claimed that there was no such person as Qian Menglin in the factory. The plaintiff's lawyer stated that Qian Menglin was actually Qian Zhenhua and should be summoned again. The defendant's lawyer also claimed that this case was caused by another case. The defendant's side, for the sake of humanity and morality, had consulted with the plaintiff's lawyer about a reconciliation plan, which showed considerable promise. Therefore, he requested that the hearing be postponed. The plaintiff's lawyer also</p>
<p>Expressed Agreement: Judge Zhan briefly questioned the plaintiff Xu Yucheng, and announced that the case would be postponed and heard again later. After the announcement, the injured plaintiffs refused to leave the courtroom and cried loudly. Fortunately, after the detectives and court police kindly persuaded them, the crowd reluctantly left in tears. As for the other case, at 2:30 PM, the case of Wu Shaowen and forty others accusing the factory manager Jiang Junyan was opened. The court was heavily guarded, closing the iron gates at the entrance and only opening a small door for people to enter and exit. Western police chiefs were dispatched to supervise</p>
<p>All the Court Police in their Duty of Defense: The police also believed that maintaining order was their duty, so they sent several senior officers, including the Chinese Deputy Chief Xu Zhengquan, leading twenty Chinese police officers, a team of Indian police officers, and a team of Hu Erdao, as well as the Huizi Police Station Chinese Detective Chief Shang Wu, supervising all detectives to attend the court to maintain order. Therefore, detectives were densely distributed inside and outside the courtroom, and the situation was quite serious. Before long, Judge Liu Yugui ascended the seat of the Eighth Criminal Court and was immediately addressed by the defendant's defending lawyer, Xu Jie, who stated that the case had been mediated by impartial groups and lawyer Jin Yu,</p>
<p>Who Stepped Forward to Mediate: Therefore, he requested permission to postpone the case again. The plaintiff's lawyer also expressed sympathy. Judge Liu said that since someone had come forward to mediate the case, it was permissible to postpone it, but during this postponement period, the plaintiff's lawyer should seriously discuss beneficial solutions with the plaintiffs. It would be best if a reconciliation could be reached, otherwise they should quietly wait for a legal resolution and should not have any extraneous actions. The plaintiff's lawyer should explain this to each of the plaintiffs. After the announcement, the judge approved the postponement of the case for ten days and the resumption of the hearing at 2:30 PM. The plaintiffs also gradually exited, and the order was good. The police security was also withdrawn accordingly.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Wu Xixiang and Others Accuse of Embezzling Twelve Million: Continued Hearing Yesterday; Defendant Files Counterclaim; Judge Orders Witness Deng Junxiang to Court <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>Wu Xixiang, Xisi, Xixun, and Xiliu, four brothers from Anhui, residing at No. 22 Puqing Lane, Malong Road, French Concession, are the sons of the late Wu Fuqing, chief accountant of the Shanghai HSBC Bank. Recently, they hired lawyers Zhang Shizhao and Peng Yuanxun to file a complaint with the Criminal Court of the Second Special Court, accusing their cousin Wu Hengsun, son of Wu Youling, former comprador of the Beiping HSBC Bank, residing at No. 4, Lane 159, Haig Road, of embezzling</p>
<p>Partnership Business: Earnings and family property during his tenure as a comprador of the Beiping HSBC Bank, amounting to twelve million taels. After a preliminary hearing, the court adjourned and scheduled another hearing because the defendant did not appear. The plaintiffs’ intentions have already been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Qiu Huaning of the Second Special Court again opened the Second Criminal Court for a continued hearing. Apart from Wu Xixiang, who did not appear, Xisi, Xixun, and Xiliu, along with the defendant Wu Hengsun, each arrived with their lawyers. After first questioning both parties regarding their age and residence, the court ordered the plaintiff Wu Xixun to state the main points of the indictment. He briefly stated that the former Beiping HSBC Bank</p>
<p>Comprador Position: Was nominally held by the defendant's father, Youling, but was actually a partnership business operated by the three families within the family, and they had not yet separated. After the death of their father, Fuqing, the defendant's side stopped paying the allowance. In May of the previous year, they negotiated with the defendant, but mediation by relatives and friends failed to reach a satisfactory resolution. Asked whether there was a partnership agreement at the time, he replied, no. The court then issued a copy of the defendant's counterclaim accusing them of false accusations to the plaintiffs in court. At this point, the defendant's lawyer stood up and stated that, regardless of the facts, from a legal point of view,</p>
<p>There Was Absolutely No Basis: (1) The defendant's father had been dead for eighteen years, and the statute of limitations for pursuing the right to prosecute expires within ten years. (2) The plaintiffs and the defendant are blood relatives within the fifth degree of kinship. If there was embezzlement, it would be a crime that requires a complaint to be made. The plaintiffs had already hired a lawyer to negotiate in May of the previous year, as evidenced by letters. Now, two years have passed, and the plaintiffs should have filed a lawsuit within six months, but the time has passed. (3) The facts of the dispute occurred in Beiping, and according to Article 4 of the Shanghai French Concession Court Establishment Agreement, the</p>
<p>Jurisdiction Is Incorrect: (4) The dispute involves events that occurred over eighteen years ago and have been subject to several general amnesties, so the court should order a dismissal. (5) Regardless of whether the defendant's father had an agreement with the plaintiffs' father to operate a comprador business but did not distribute the profits, the plaintiffs would be mistaken in their claim, as the father's liabilities cannot be inherited by his son. He requested the court to rule for dismissal or non-acceptance. Then, Zhang Shizhao, the lawyer representing the plaintiffs, stood up and</p>
<p>Responded to Each Point: After that, the court questioned the plaintiff Wu Xixun and Deng Junxiang about when they succeeded as compradors. Wu replied that he succeeded after the death of the defendant's father, but he could not remember the year. The court then questioned the defendant Wu Hengsun, who testified that his ancestors fled from Anhui to Jiangsu during the Taiping Rebellion and had no family property. They each made a living on their own. The comprador position at the Beiping HSBC Bank was solely operated by his father for twenty years, with an annual surplus of about 20,000 gold pieces, which also had to be distributed to colleagues. He provided some relief and assistance to the plaintiffs' side when they were in need, but it was not a fixed amount each year. As for the claim of twelve million,</p>
<p>The Difference Is Too Great: The plaintiff Wu Xixun also stated to the court that when his father celebrated his eightieth birthday, his cousin Youling came to Shanghai to offer his congratulations. His father asked him for twelve million, and he said that he only had six million. The judge said that everyone was dead, and it was useless to say that. Now, the defendant has filed a counterclaim accusing them of false accusations. Wu replied that they were stating the facts. At this point, the plaintiffs' lawyer presented two old-fashioned red letters as evidence, stating that the defendant's father had once mentioned in the letters that he had stored funds on their behalf. At this point, Judge Qiu ordered the plaintiffs to invite the witness Deng Junxiang (currently residing in Suzhou) to court to testify and informed the defendant that the counterclaim would be accepted. The hearing was adjourned to 10:00 AM on August 8th, and the court announced the adjournment.</p>

<p>The Qingde Tang Chinese medicine shop at No. 174 Caishi Street, French Concession (intersection of Dongxinqiao Street), has been opened by a person named Mao Xing from Ningbo for over thirty years. The business is still manageable, employing over ten employees and apprentices. Among them is a member of the Mao family named Mao Shoufeng, now nineteen years old, who has been apprenticing in the shop for many years. Two years ago, they took in an apprentice from the same hometown named Shen Baoyi, eighteen years old. Although Shen was young, he was by nature fierce and often caused trouble with his colleagues. However, the shop authorities, out of consideration for the introducer, often accommodated him. Unexpectedly, this only fueled Shen's ferocity. The day before yesterday, he quarreled with Mao Shoufeng again over a trivial matter. Shen harbored evil intentions. Yesterday, around 5:00 AM, Shen took advantage of the fact that everyone in the shop was asleep and Mao Shoufeng was sound asleep on a long bench outside the shop. Shen secretly took a sharp knife and slashed Mao's head and neck several times. When Mao cried out for help and the people in the shop woke up and checked, the murderer had already fled to the drying platform and escaped over the wall without a trace. The shop then ordered someone to send Mao to Renji Hospital for treatment. At the same time, they filed a report to the police. Mao's injuries were very serious, and his life was in danger.</p>

<p>Jin Genzhang, a 23-year-old from Shaoxing, recently lost his job and could not make a living. He saw that Zhang Ni's wife, an old woman from Ningbo residing at No. 13, Lane 415, Yuezhou Road, had a gold ring on her hand that was quite valuable. He intended to rob her. However, there were often people gathering in the neighborhood playing mahjong, so it was difficult to do it without weapons. He told a fellow villager named Old Chen about the situation, and Old Chen obtained a fake gun. The two went to rob her together at 11:30 AM the day before yesterday. There was a "room for rent" sign posted in front of Zhang Ni's house. They used the excuse of renting a room to enter the house. They met Dong Chen's wife, a woman from Ningbo who was a tenant, and falsely asked where the vacant room for rent was. Just as Zhang Ni's wife arrived, the thief Jin took out the fake gun from his sleeve and pointed it at her chest, forcing her to quickly remove the gold ring. Mrs. Hua Chen ran out and shouted "robber." Neighbors Ji Jintang and Xia Liansheng and Huizi Police Station Chinese Detective Yin Zhanqing, upon hearing the alarm, rushed to the scene and captured Jin Genzhang. The fake gun was also seized and taken to the police station for detention. Old Chen took the opportunity to escape. The thief Jin was escorted to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special District yesterday morning.工部局 (Public Works Department) Lawyer Wang Yaotang detailed the previous situation and requested an investigation. Detective Yin then reported the details of the incident and presented the fake gun for inspection. Mrs. Dong Chen and Zhang Ni's daughter, A Xiang, also testified about the circumstances of the robbery. When questioned, the defendant's testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be detained pending sentencing.</p>

<p>Russian woman, Ai Te'erle, a waitress at the No. 375 Jiujiang Road wine shop on North Sichuan Road, and fellow Russian woman, Wei Le Cui Gu, initially teased each other, then suddenly a conflict arose, and finally Ai Te, holding a sharp knife, stabbed Wei Le in the abdomen.

<p>Miao Horen, a 38-year-old local man who made a living as a fortune teller, lived with Chen, a 30-year-old woman from Funing, at No. 236 North Fujian Road. They had been living together for eleven years, and their relationship was usually good, and they had children. Recently, Chen suddenly left without telling him and did not return at night. Miao searched everywhere but could not find her. Until the night before last, he finally found Chen at her parents' house in Gaolangqiao, Zhabei, and they went home together. However, Miao had heard from people that they had seen Chen walking along the road with Wang Lianji, a 40-year-old coppersmith from Zhenjiang who lived at No. 230 on the same road. Therefore, he suspected that Chen and Wang were having an affair. Although there was no evidence, he was very unhappy and thought of punishing them. Yesterday morning, he borrowed a No. 25 handgun with seven bullets from his neighbor, the vagrant Jin Fushou. Around 6:00 AM, he went to Wang Lianji's house, falsely claiming to introduce him to a job and asked Wang to come out with him. Wang was unaware of his intentions and followed Miao outside. When they reached the Yushun Lane at the intersection of Qipu Road and Henan Road, Miao suddenly took out the gun and fired a shot at Wang, hitting him in the right eyebrow. After the incident, Miao deposited the gun at Shen Rusong's house at No. 768 Tiantong Road. The Huizi Police Station in charge received a report and immediately sent Chinese Detective Shang Wu, Detectives Zheng Hualing, and Li Wenbin to investigate. They sent Wang to the hospital for treatment. As his injuries were minor, he was discharged from the hospital. Shang and the other detectives went to arrest Miao Renhe, Shen Rusong, and Jin Fushou. The handgun and six bullets were confiscated. They were all taken into custody and will be escorted to the First Special Court for interrogation on Monday.</p>

<p>The Maoli No. 2 new wheel of the Maoli Commercial Shipping Bureau, No. 4 Hengxinli, Waitan, South City, set sail from Shanghai on the 11th of this month for its maiden voyage on the Shanghai-Taiwan line. The ship arrived at the Dinghai Wharf the afternoon after next but suddenly suffered an accident and sank. The details have been reported in the newspaper. The following is a continuation of the situation:</p>
<p>Claim Cargo: Regarding the cargo loaded on the ship, it is now known that the salvage company派水鬼 (sent divers) dispatched by the China Salvage Company have already salvaged it. The shipping bureau and the China Salvage Company jointly issued a notice stating that, after the Maoli No. 2 was in an accident in Dinghai, the cargo and luggage loaded on the ship have been salvaged. Customers are urged to quickly go to Dinghai within two weeks to claim them according to the procedures. Those who have insured water insurance should also notify the insurers. Customers should not delay and miss the opportunity.</p>
<p>Seeking Facts: The Shanghai Association of Fellow Townsmen of Taizhou, in the Republic of China Road, heard that most of the passengers on the ship on the 11th were fellow townsmen from Taiwan and were saddened by the tragic incident. Because the true situation of the accident and the number of deaths varied, they have published a notice to seek facts.

<p>Qiu Gubiao, a native of Ningbo, was 28 years old. He had been working as a tea server at the Dakang Gold Exchange, a brokerage firm run by his fellow townsman Wang Ziting (resident of No. 28 Qingyun Lane, Raul Dong Road, French Concession) on Second Horse Road. Recently, Wang's business suffered losses, and the firm closed down, so Qiu was serving in Wang's household. Suddenly, on the evening of the 25th at 9 PM, he went out and checked into Room 16 of the World Hotel at No. 9 Huage Nie Road, Eight Immortals Bridge. It is unknown what caused him to commit suicide by poisoning that night. At noon the next day, the tea server Zhang Asi (24 years old, from Shaoxing) tried to wake him up, but he did not respond after calling for a long time. He opened the door and went inside, finding Qiu already dead in bed. He immediately reported to the French police, who sent detectives to investigate. In the deceased's pocket, they found a note with his master's address. Zhang took the body to the S仁丰元 branch hall for examination. He also notified his master, as the deceased's family was still in the Ningbo countryside. His master sent a letter to notify them. The detective investigated the employer but could not ascertain the cause of the suicide. When Qiu went out on the evening of the 25th, he said he was going to a film company to shoot a movie. Yesterday morning, the French police reported the case to the Second Court, which appointed Prosecutor Wang Ren and a forensic scribe to the scene. They confirmed that the deceased had died from poisoning before death. The body has been handed over to the Tongren Funeral Home for temporary storage, awaiting family members to claim it. Later, the employer purchased clothes and a coffin for burial, and the coffin is temporarily stored in the hall, awaiting the arrival of family members from Shanghai to claim it.</p>

<p>Dagon News reports that the East China Tobacco Factory on Tangshan Road in Hongkou employs over 1,000 male and female workers. In the past, the business was quite prosperous. However, due to the recent economic downturn and sluggish business, it had no choice but to issue a notice on the 28th of last month to lay off a large number of workers, which aroused the opposition of all the workers, who demanded that the decision be rescinded. This was not granted. The workers petitioned the party and government authorities to mediate. Due to the insistence of both parties, the matter has not yet been resolved. It is now known that Zhou Xuexiang, a standing committee member of the Shanghai General Labor Union, believes that the labor unrest has been delayed and unresolved, which is detrimental to social well-being. He specially invited Shen Changgeng and Zhang Shankun to serve as mediators. As a result, the factory paid each worker a severance payment, which the workers expressed satisfaction with, and the matter was declared to be resolved satisfactorily.</p>

Yesterday morning, Judge Zhan Liangce opened the Second Criminal Court for continued hearing. Li was defended by lawyers Wu Peng. The police lawyer Zhang Shizhu stated that after the postponement, it was found that the defendant had used the same behavior in November of last year to defraud Chen Jimei, the owner of the Jimei Dancing School at No. 592 Sichuan Road, of 10 yuan. At that time, he told Chen Jimei that opening a dancing school required a donation for a license, otherwise it would have to be closed, causing Chen to be deceived. This case has also been filed. The court then questioned Li and allowed the lawyers for defense and the police to debate.

<h3 id="e163">Baseball League First Sound: Chinese Team Loses to Amateurs <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Chinese Team Had Good Technique but Lacked Experience, Resulting in a Loss with Dignity</p>
<p>Today, Chinese Team vs. Textile. The Chinese baseball team faced amateur teams from American and Japanese communities in China, marking the first game of the Shanghai Baseball League and the Chinese team's debut. Being newly formed, the Chinese team was no match for the seasoned amateur teams. However, their performance was still commendable. Unfortunately, due to a lack of prior match experience, they were flustered, and their formation was not strict, resulting in a 1-10 defeat. Today, the Chinese team will play against Shanghai Textile at 3 PM at the venue.</p>
<p>Balanced Situation. The Chinese team started on the offensive, with Jin Can hitting a single to first base. However, he was caught stealing at third base. The amateur player, Hepburn, was immediately struck out. La Lai hit the pitcher's ball, and the ball flew far, scoring a point. Fortunately, they defended firmly afterward. Although Walter got a hit, it was ineffective. In the second inning, He Qionghua of the Chinese team got a hit and reached base. Lei Ying struck out, Huang Yuanfa got on base, and Xian also got a hit, helping Huang score a point. However, He was caught running, and Zeng Ruiqi also struck out. The Chinese team had one hit and scored one point. The amateurs took advantage of the Chinese team's</p>
<p>Failed Effort. Third inning. The Chinese team's momentum was strong. Zeng Ruikang hit the pitcher's ball and got on base. Huang Yuanfa and Hu Hezhong both had hits, but Zeng was caught stealing. He Qionghua got on base with four balls. If Ruozhu was not caught, they could have scored. At this time, the Chinese players were all on base, and there was still a chance. Unfortunately, they failed to follow up, and Lei Ying struck out, resulting in a failed effort. When the amateurs were on the offensive, the Chinese team's formation was not strict, their movements were slow, and they made many errors, allowing the amateurs to score four points. This greatly damaged the Chinese team's morale, resulting in a 1-6 loss.</p>
<p>Persistence and Struggle. In the top of the fourth inning, Zeng Kun of the Chinese team hit a single, but it was ineffective. At this time, the Chinese team showed signs of panic. Gan Xian's pitching was also inaccurate, giving away five four-ball walks, allowing the amateurs to score four points without a hit. Despite this setback, the Chinese team remained calm. In the next four innings, they prevented the amateurs from scoring. In the eighth inning, Gan Xian hit a home run, sending Lei Ying home for another point. In the ninth inning, the amateurs seized the initiative, resulting in a 2-10 victory for the amateurs. The scores for each inning are as follows: Chinese 0-1-0-0-0-0-0-0-1, total 2 points.</p>
<p>Inning (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9)</p>
<p>Amateur 1 1 4 4 0 0 0 0 0, Total 10 points</p>
<p>Match Summary</p>

<h3 id="e164">Japanese Tennis Players Continue Performance Today: Lin-Qiu Doubles Unluckily Lose; Qiu Feihai Draws with Hirai Today <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>The Japanese Four Universities Tennis Team, consisting of Hirai and three others, gave their first performance yesterday afternoon at the French Club court. In two singles matches and one doubles match, the Japanese players were victorious. However, the number of spectators was not as large as expected, only four or five hundred people. The matches were only occasionally exciting. The results of the matches are as follows:</p>
<p>Four Players' Skills. Among the four players, Hirai is the most noteworthy. It is said that Hirai is ranked first in Japan. His hitting technique is indeed clear, agile, and the forehand and backhand strokes are extremely proficient. The backhand is as powerful as the forehand. The match between him and Qiu Feihai will definitely be a fierce battle. Lin is ranked ninth in Japan, and his skills are average. His backhand is unreliable, and he relies entirely on a single shot from the baseline. His skill level is comparable to that of Squier. His doubles play is more impressive, with excellent net play and smashing skills. If given proper training, he could be a formidable opponent with De Fu.</p>
<p>Lin vs. Squier. Squier is better than Lin in every aspect, and his tactics are very clever. His loss was not due to Lin's victory, but rather self-destruction. In the first set, Squier took the lead with 4-3, and Lin won two games. However, Squier won consecutive games to win the set. In the second set, Squier also won consecutive games, creating a sense of unstoppable momentum. Unexpectedly, due to too many mistakes, Lin won six games straight. In the third set, Squier took the lead with 3-1, but Lin again reversed the situation and won 6-4. Squier's hitting technique has greatly improved, but he still lacks stability. Otherwise, defeating Lin would have been easy.</p>
<p>Doubles Loss. The opponents in the Lin-Qiu doubles match did not seem particularly outstanding. However, Qiu Feihai's performance was lacking. His shots lacked control and went out of bounds repeatedly. His smashes were weak, and his teamwork was poor. Lin Baohua was unable to carry the team alone and was at a loss. In the first set, each team won their service games, and they even took the lead with 7-6. Unexpectedly, they lost three consecutive games. The second set was beyond salvage.</p>
<p>Hirai's Appearance. It was already late, and the audience began to leave. The match ended hastily. Sudo's performance was excellent, and Hirai was almost affected by it. The first set was 3-3, 5-5, and ended with 7-5. The second set was 2-2, 4-3, and ended with 6-4, reaching the height of tension.</p>

<p>The basketball team of the Third Regiment of the Tax Police of the Ministry of Finance came to Shanghai this time to compete with strong teams. With one win in three games, the results were surprisingly good. According to the original agreement, they were supposed to play against Hua Qiang tonight. However, last night, the person in charge of Hua Qiang said that several players were busy competing in the Xian Fang Huai tennis tournament, so they had to forfeit tonight's game. They expressed their sincere apologies. Yesterday, the team played against Tibet and won 29 to 28 by one point, which can be said to be fortunate. The entire team will stay in Shanghai for another three days before returning to Xuzhou to report for duty. The results of yesterday's game are listed on the left.</p>

<h3 id="e173">Grand Occasion of the Guangdong Swimming Team's Open Competition <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>The He Sisters from Qingdao Join as Guest Performers</p>
<p>Two Little Heroes Also Participate in the Water</p>
<p>The Guangdong swimming team held an open swimming competition at the International Swimming Pool on Seymour Road at 8 PM the night before last (26th). More than 30 people registered to participate, and the He sisters, three female swimming prodigies who had just arrived in Shanghai from Qingdao, and a ten-year-old boy joined the performance. The audience was packed, and the event was a great success. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Escape from a Sack and Somersaults. The first event was the 60-yard open freestyle, with more than 30 participants. They were divided into eight preliminary rounds, with the top two from each group advancing. The results of each group were acceptable, but they all made the mistake of not following the straight lane, which was due to a lack of practice. The escape from a sack was performed by the team's vice-captain, Zhong Choujun. He put himself in a large sack, weighed it down with several large stones, and tied the opening tightly. He escaped in just ten seconds, which earned him a lot of applause. The third act was somersaults, performed by Guo Ruiji of the Guangdong team, who performed six or seven somersaults in a row.</p>
<p>Three Sisters and Tall Men's Swimming. The fifth event was the tall men's swimming, performed by Huang Rixiong and Chen Baoyi of the Guangdong team, who connected each other and performed human movements. Next was the performance of the He sisters from Qingdao. First, Ms. Wu Wenjing performed the 60-yard freestyle, accompanied by Huang Rixiong of the Guangdong team. Next, Ms. He Wenjin performed the 60-yard breaststroke, accompanied by Wu Gansheng, the breaststroke king of the Guangdong team. Both ladies showed excellent posture and speed, especially Wenjin's breaststroke, which was exceptionally beautiful. Wenjin was the champagne of the previous Qingdao City.</p>
<p>Little Heroes and Diving Performances. Two little heroes showed their prowess in the water last night. Chen Youda, who was only twelve years old, bravely competed with many strong athletes. Although he did not win, it was not easy. The other, who was less than three feet tall, was said to be ten years old, but looked only seven or eight years old. He said his name was Lu Guolin. In addition to performing diving, he also performed the 60-yard breaststroke, without panicking, and with a natural attitude. The time at the finish line was one minute and nineteen seconds, which was remarkable. As for Chen Youda, who was eleven years old, in addition to participating in the 120-yard open backstroke, with a time of two minutes and twenty-seven and a half seconds, he also participated in the 210-yard breaststroke, but dropped out after four laps due to exhaustion. Next was the freestyle diving, performed by Deng Molin, Zhu Jiongpei, Chen Baoyi, and Huo Zhenghong of the Guangdong team.</p>
<p>Water Fight and Catching Ducks. In the water fight, Guangdong team captain and ice master Huang Rixiong was the champion. The method used was to float a large bamboo pole in the water. Two people crossed it, each striking with a firewood bag, and the one who fell into the water lost. Those who were knocked down by Huang included Dun Shoujun and Wu Gansheng, among others. In the end, Ouyang Wenliang knocked the champion into the water. Next was the duck catching performance, which was held in two groups. Guo Ruiji caught the duck in one minute in the first group, and Huo Zhenghong caught the duck in thirty-seven seconds in the second group. This act was particularly interesting, as the team members were eager to catch the duck, but the lively duck had already dived into the water, disappearing without a trace, earning applause from the ladies on both sides of the pool. The event ended at around 11 PM. The results of the open competition are attached below.</p>
<p>110-yard Freestyle Final: Lu Shungen, Guo Ruiji, 1 minute 41 seconds.</p>
<p>110-yard Breaststroke Final: Wang Weijun, Guo Ruiji, Chen Youda, 2 minutes 4 and 2/5 seconds.</p>

<p>The China Child Education Society believes that child education facilities should be based on academic principles. In recent years, child psychology has made rapid progress, and there must be a systematic introduction for kindergarten and elementary school teachers to refer to. During this Children's Year, the editorial department of the society has specially invited national psychological experts to contribute selectively on child psychology research, such as Cai Lesheng's Methods of Child Psychology, Guo Renyuan and Hu Jinan's Origins and Development of Embryonic Behavior, Sun Guohua's Newborn Infants, Huang Ji's Formation of Growth and Behavior, Liao Shicheng's Infant's Movement and Vision Function in the First Two Years, Tang Cheng's Development of Emotions, Chen Xuanhan's Measurement of Intelligence Growth, Shen Yougan's Language Development, Wu Zelin's Social Behavior of Children, Lu Zhiwei's Learning of Children, Ou Yuanhuai's Morality of Children, Quan Zengxia's Philosophy of Children, Xiao Xiaorong's Parental Level, Pan Shu's Environmental Efforts, Liu Tingfang's Gender Differences, Gao Juefu's Speech Pathology, Xie Xunchu's Legacy, Guo Yicen's Physiological Desires, Gao Junshan's Genius Children, Wu Nanxuan's Mentally Retarded Children, Ai Wei's Children with Special Talents or Special Difficulties, Zhang Yixiang's Children with Adaptation Difficulties, Ge Chengdiao's Primitive Children, Chen Heqin's Development of Chinese Children's Psychology and Motor Skills. The results will reportedly be published in the Children's Monthly. According to Dong Renjian of the society, this move is unprecedented in the academic world, not only providing a strong inspiration and supreme honor to child education colleagues, but also demonstrating the scholars' strong interest and close cooperation with the Child Education Society. It is said that there are similar plans that will continue to be carried out.</p>

<p>The cotton market is firming up, and the rising trend is intensifying, mainly due to the substantial reduction in exchange rates and the discovery of new high prices in the gold market. There are rumors circulating about currency issues, and a certain party is also purchasing large quantities of cotton. Bulls are tightening their grip on the August contracts and are not letting go. However, current cotton consumption feels particularly sluggish.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao Increases Bets on Both Sides:  The pre-market opening for spot cotton saw a surge due to the rise in American cotton and the soaring gold prices. Rumors spread in the market, and buying sentiment intensified, causing yarn prices to rise sharply. As a result, the bulls actively increased their bets. However, large bears also resisted by increasing their bets, indicating that both sides have considerable strength. Nevertheless, the shrinking exchange rate favors the bulls. As for cotton production news, the Northwest is still doing well, and although the Hubei region suffered losses, the floodwaters have been receding rapidly in recent days, potentially offering some relief. However, the losses in Shandong are extremely severe. As a result, prices for all months rose by three to four and a half to five and a half cents compared to the previous day's closing price.

However, inland factories continued to adopt a policy of selling short on rallies.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the opening of American cotton was sluggish, with prices for all months falling by 3 to 6 points. Industry insiders anticipate a formal announcement regarding cotton industry loans. In the early morning, the market was weak due to unfavorable news from Liverpool and foreign merchants selling off. Adjustments were minimal, with the October contract slightly firmer than distant contracts. Subsequently, prices rebounded due to short covering and strength in the wheat market. Current demand is weak, and shorts made some purchases in the new crop months. However, demand is quite weak. Reports indicate that the new cotton has a fiber length of one inch and large bolls. The price at the ship's side is 15 cents and 75 points, which is 40 points lower than old cotton. Reportedly, some transactions of new cotton were made at low prices.

<p>— Jun Peng</p>
<p>Children! Now is the time to use your strength! Everyone quickly issue a general mobilization order! Children who read the newspaper should know that Shanghai has compulsory literacy education, which has started on July 1st. Although there are more than 60,000 illiterate people who have enthusiastically enrolled, do you think this counts as popularizing education when more than 80 percent of China is illiterate?</p>
<p>Literacy is a tool for seeking knowledge, and knowledge is the driving force for developing all undertakings. The strength of a country depends on the level of knowledge of its people. To seek a high level of knowledge, we must popularize education. Now, to save our precarious motherland, this is the only way. Therefore, I ask all children to use their sincere hearts to teach illiterate people to read.</p>
<p>Children! Don't think that we are young and don't have much ability, but you must know that we are powerful warriors in this movement! It doesn't take much effort for us to teach people to read. Just teach the words that the teacher teaches you every day to illiterate people, one by one. In this way, one teaches ten, ten teaches a hundred, and we guide each other in turn. It is not difficult to achieve the goal of compulsory literacy education.</p>
<p>Children all over the country, during this hot summer vacation, you probably don't have much summer homework. You can always take some time to implement the "little teacher" system, take on this extremely important mission, and serve the country and the nation. At that time, how glorious and respectable the "little teacher" will be!</p>

<p>— Kang Jian Zhai Fu</p>
<p>If we participate in a tea party or a dinner party, we must pay attention to the etiquette of eating and drinking.</p>
<p>When entering the seat, be sure to identify your appropriate seat. After entering the seat, every word and action should always take care of those at the same table, and don't be a strange person doing things separately. Also, don't show a rude and reckless appearance to annoy people.</p>
<p>When chewing things, don't open your mouth too wide. Don't chew from side to side like cattle and sheep eating grass. Don't have your mouth full of food. Chew slowly and deliberately. Be especially careful that things don't get stuck in your nasal cavity or trachea, coughing and sneezing are the most impolite.</p>
<p>When drinking tea and swallowing rice, it is best to do so lightly and without making a sound. Don't make gulping sounds like cattle and sheep drinking water, or donkeys and horses chewing grass.</p>
<p>At the banquet, do not spread your elbows and encroach on the seat of your neighbors. Every move must be gentle and elegant.</p>
<p>When pouring wine, you must stand up. Don't drink too much. Wine should be drunk slowly. Don't force people to drink too much.</p>
<p>As a guest, every meal and drink should leave some surplus. The host should let the guests finish their meal and then stop eating, so as not to make the guests feel uneasy.</p>

<p>It's like the aerial battle has closed, the flags have been lowered and the drums have been silenced, and the attack has stopped.</p>
<h3 id="e195">Why is the Indoor Temperature Different? (Common Sense) <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Chu Yu</p>
<p>Recently, the weather is getting hotter every day. Every family has built awnings and covered curtains to prevent direct sunlight. However, the indoor temperature varies from household to household due to the size of the house, the presence or absence of surrounding trees, and the type of windows. Moreover, the summer heat in the city is more severe than in the countryside. However, the color of the tiles on the roof and the paving materials of the road have the greatest impact on the summer heat. Why? When the sun's heat shines on the roof of a house, according to scientists' experiments, a roof covered with red tiles absorbs 67%, a roof covered with green bricks absorbs 75%, and a black galvanized iron roof absorbs 77%. This is because the materials used for the roof are different and the color difference causes the heat absorption to be high or low. Other factors such as the surrounding roads and patios of the house also affect the temperature. Although the temperature of the road varies depending on the location and time, roughly speaking, for an air temperature of 28.8 degrees, the heat absorbed is as follows: wood-brick road is 45.0 degrees, asphalt road is 42.3 degrees, yellow sand cement mixed road is 39.0 degrees, stone road is 38.4 degrees, and yellow sand road is 36.0 degrees. Judging from this, the paved road is actually hotter. Therefore, in today's world with developed transportation, paving is necessary due to the demands of the public. On the one hand, to reduce the summer heat and facilitate pedestrians, planting trees along the road is both spectacular and can avoid the heat.</p>

<p>— Chonglou</p>
<p>When the cicada's song in the tree has not yet stopped, the cricket in front of the steps has already chirped.</p>
<p>We all know that the cicada is a leisurely and comfortable animal; in the summer, it does not do any work, it only knows how to sing loudly: when the weather gradually gets cold, it will starve to death because it has not prepared food, but the cricket is different from the cicada. The cricket's chirp is very meaningful. It is reporting to us that autumn has already arrived, and we should not be taking in the cool air, but we should hurry up and work hard on our own careers; and the cricket is brave. When others bully it, it will definitely resist bravely and never shrink back.</p>
<p>Dear little friends! When you hear the cricket chirping, do you also think that the year is coming to an end and you should make a final effort? And when you see the cricket's brave spirit, are you also prepared to overcome your inner fears, to forge your strong physique, and to be a healthy little citizen?</p>

<p>— Ji Yu</p>
<p>What is the function of a newspaper? Newspapers roughly have two functions: one is to guide the people, so that the people can obtain various kinds of knowledge. For example, if children read the newspaper every day, their knowledge will progress in all directions. The other is to convey the opinions of the people, so the newspaper is also called the "mouthpiece of the people", and journalists are called "uncrowned emperors".</p>
<p>Where does news come from? There are two sources of news: the first is collected by the newspaper's own reporters or correspondents, and the second is obtained from news agencies. There are two types of news agencies: government-run and commercial. The purpose of government-run agencies is to publicize themselves, and the purpose of commercial agencies is to make money. There are many foreign news agencies in our country, such as Reuters, Associated Press, and Havas, etc., which can often be seen in newspapers. Our own news agencies also exist, such as the Central News Agency, National News Agency, Guowen News Agency, Shenshi News Agency, and Xinsheng News Agency, all of which are national news agencies, numbering about 160.</p>
<p>What is the history of our own newspaper? The oldest newspaper in China today is the Shen Bao, which you are reading, which has been published for more than 60 years. The second oldest is the Xinwen Bao, which has also been published for more than 40 years. Since the publication of the Shen Bao, our own Chinese newspapers have gradually increased. Now, there are more than 400 registered newspapers in the country.</p>
<h3 id="e199">The Science Teacher Does Magic (Science Game) <a href="#e199" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c199" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">199</a></h3>
<p>— He Gongchao</p>
<p>The Strange Glass</p>
<p>The science teacher came on stage with a glass and a piece of paper. He said to the children below the stage: "Today, my magic trick is simple, but also interesting."</p>
<p>He put the piece of paper on the edge of the table, poured half a glass of water into the cup, and pressed the cup on the piece of paper, saying:</p>
<p>"Children, who can take the piece of paper in your hand without moving the glass?"</p>
<p>The children below the stage all thought: "The piece of paper is pressed under the glass. If you want to take the piece of paper out without moving the glass, it is impossible!" Therefore, not a single child stood up and said: "I can, I can."</p>
<p>The science teacher smiled and said: "Actually, this is the easiest thing to do. Watch." He quickly and forcefully pulled the piece of paper, and the glass did not move at all, but the piece of paper was already in his hand. Then, the children below the stage all opened their surprised eyes and praised the simplicity and fun of the science teacher's magic trick in their hearts.</p>
<p>The science teacher said: "Do you know why the cup didn't move? Originally, all stationary objects cannot move by themselves. The copper coins on the table will never fly into your hands by themselves. At the same time, all moving objects cannot stop by themselves. The wood rolling down from the top of the mountain will never stop halfway. This property of objects is called "inertia". But if we use our hands to take the copper coins, the copper coins will move; if we take big stones to block the wood, the wood will stop; breaking this inertia is called "force". Just now, I used my hand to hit the piece of paper, and the "force" only reached the piece of paper, and did not reach the cup. The cup's inertia was not broken, so it still didn't move.</p>
<p>"However, when you try it, if you pull it slowly, the cup will follow the piece of paper. This is what you should pay attention to."</p>

<p>— Ouyang Gu</p>
<p>Recently, the Hangzhou People's Club, in order to promote children's health and promote entertainment, has specially organized a "Children's Haha Troupe". Anyone aged between eight and fifteen can participate freely. The main purpose of the troupe is: to require three big laughs every day, to hold a troupe meeting every week, and to hold a haha meeting once within the prescribed period, to perform various interesting skills to increase interest. It is said that after the announcement of this news, dozens of students from private primary schools such as XX have already registered to join the People's Club.</p>
<p>Children! What do you think after hearing the above news? I must tell you that laughter, from a physiological point of view: on the one hand, it can eliminate troubles, and on the other hand, it can liven up the body and mind. It is indeed a good way to prolong life. At the same time, we can't feel tired when we do anything. In addition, it can make a thing progress smoothly without fear of difficulties. Therefore, we must imitate the "Children's Haha Troupe" organized by the Hangzhou People's Club, or if there are brothers and sisters at home, gathering together can also organize a similar haha troupe, stipulating three big laughs every day. Isn't this also very interesting?</p>
<p>Children! Don't be silent anymore, now is the time for children to cheer up! Get up and do something that is beneficial to your body and mind!</p>

When she grew up, he hoped to marry her to someone powerful. He summoned the sun and said to him, "Take this girl as your wife, I want to marry her to someone powerful." The sun replied, "The clouds are more powerful than me, they can cover me." The hermit heard what the sun said, and ordered him to go back, summoned the clouds, and made the same proposal to him. The clouds replied, "The wind is more powerful than me; it can blow me away." The hermit summoned the wind and made the same proposal to him. The wind replied, "The mountains are more powerful than me, because I cannot move them." So the hermit summoned the Himalayas and made the same proposal to him. The mountain replied, "Mice are more powerful than me, because they can dig holes in me."</p>
<p>So the hermit summoned a mountain mouse and said to him, "Take this girl as your wife." The mouse replied, "I am willing, but how can she walk into my cave!" His words were reasonable, so the hermit said, "Then turn her back into a mouse." He used magic to turn her back into a mouse and told the male mouse to take her away.</p>

<p>Rags can be used to make paper, which is of considerable value in terms of waste utilization. Now, I will teach you how to utilize a piece of waste. The effectiveness of the result is truly incredible. You can achieve it in one go, so why not do it?</p>
<p>Use an old Mobiloil lampshade. Only the bottom needs to be complete, and the top can be broken. Then, make a funnel shape out of paper and place it on top of the lampshade. Add a little sugar water. Place the lampshade on your desk. Soon, flies will come to patronize it. The flies will perch on the funnel, sucking the sugar water, and become so happy that they forget to return. In that case, this tiny fly will fall to its death.</p>

<p>— Cao Honghui</p>
<p>Time flies so fast. It hasn't been many days since the spring semester started, and now it's summer vacation again. However, in this semester, because I didn't study hard on weekdays, my grades were not good. When the vacation started, the homeroom teacher said that I was barely promoted to the next grade. When I heard the teacher's words, I felt very ashamed, and I thought to myself that I had failed the teacher's earnest teachings. When I returned home, my older sister told my parents what the teacher had said, and my parents scolded me for not studying hard. After being scolded, I stopped being naughty, even though it was summer vacation.</p>
<p>My parents scolded me because they wanted me to improve. I thought that in the next semester, when I entered the lower class of the second grade, the knowledge would definitely be much better than that of the upper class. Therefore, during this summer vacation, in addition to doing the "vacation homework" from school, I will also seriously review the lessons I usually missed from the beginning. I will get up early every morning to practice writing, and when I have free time, I will read the various children's books and newspapers that my father bought. If there are any characters I don't know, I will ask my father or look them up in the dictionary myself. I think this way, I can make up for my shortcomings.</p>
<p>Now, I am writing about my past mistakes and my summer vacation and submitting it to the Children's Weekly. I also hope that other children like me will also "correct their mistakes" like me. Let's all work hard and do self-study. If we keep doing this, we will not be held back in the future.</p>

<p>— Xin Qing</p>
<p>July 24, 1848, was the first day of the Battle of Custoza. In one of our infantry battalions, sixty soldiers were ordered to defend a house on a nearby plateau. But they were suddenly attacked by two teams of Austrian soldiers. Because they were attacked from all sides, they did not have time to hide in the house and block the door, so they had to leave their dead and wounded comrades and lie in the fields.</p>
<p>The door was finally defended and blocked very firmly. Our soldiers hurried to the windows on the ground floor and the upper floor to desperately fire back at the attacking enemies, while the enemies were slowly advancing in a semicircle, fiercely counterattacking.</p>
<p>The sixty Italian soldiers were commanded by two lieutenants, and their commander was a silent and solemn old colonel, who was tall and had snow-white temples.</p>
<p>With them was a Sardinian little drummer, a child about fourteen years old, who looked like twelve because of his short stature. His skin was olive-colored, and in his deep-set black eyes, there seemed to be flames burning.</p>
<p>The old colonel commanded the soldiers to resist from upstairs. Every time he issued an order, it was as fast as firing a pistol. His iron-blue face was calm and expressionless.</p>
<p>The little drummer, pale-faced, stood on the table, his hands holding onto the wall, leaning out the window, and saw the Austrian soldiers passing through the fields in the haze of smoke.</p>
<p>The house was located on top of a sloping hillside, with a high, small window upstairs that could overlook the top of the hill. There were no Austrian soldiers in sight on this side of the hill. Their guns and cannons were attacking the front and sides of the house. This attack could not have been more violent. The shells hit the walls like lightning, passed through the broken roof, destroyed the ceiling, shattered the beams and pillars, doors and windows, and all the equipment. The air was filled with bricks, wood chips, and plaster like clouds. The sound of shattering glass and objects rang out overhead, echoing the terrible sound of guns and cannons.</p>
<p>The soldiers who resisted at the windows fell down from time to time after being shot, and someone would immediately drag them aside. Other soldiers ran back and forth in the rooms, covering the bleeding wounds on their bodies with their hands. In the kitchen lay a soldier, a bullet had pierced his forehead. The enemies were constantly surrounding them. The silent and solemn old colonel finally showed an uneasy appearance, rushed out of the room, and a sergeant followed him. After a while, the sergeant rushed back again and called the little drummer to go with him.</p>

<h3 id="e206">### Further Discussion on Law and Women, and a Response to the Sunday Review of the Ta Wan Pao <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>— Jennie</p>
<p>In this month's twenty-first issue of the Ta Wan Pao Sunday Review, there is a short commentary titled "Don't Marry a Man Who Has a Wife," which is a criticism of the writer's "Law and Women" article in the last issue of this publication. Although it is a humble and insightful opinion, the writer dares not agree. Therefore, I would like to further express my humble opinion as follows: (The original text of the Ta Wan Pao short commentary is appended to the right for readers to refer to.)</p>
<p>First, I remember that in my previous article, I clearly said, "In a feudal patriarchal society, a powerful young master could have three wives and four concubines, and society would praise and promote it, and the law would guarantee it in many ways. Although the present era has changed..." But our critic has taken the words out of context, lightly crossed out the sentence "In a feudal patriarchal society," and deprived my words of their temporality. Everyone knows that in the past feudal society, it was considered a blessing and a good thing for a young master to have three wives and four concubines. All kinds of legends and novels, such as the Nine Beauties Picture and the Ten Beauties Picture, depict a romantic talent surrounded by women, like a butterfly flitting among flowers. Isn't this "praised and promoted by society"? Moreover, in many places, it was considered indecent for a wealthy man's family not to have a few concubines. Therefore, it is not "overstated" to say that "society praises and promotes it." As for the law, before the implementation of laws and regulations in our country, all historical records and classics clearly wrote about men having multiple wives: "The Book of Rites" has the sentence: "When buying a concubine, if you don't know her surname, then divine it." The Gongyang Commentary records: "A prince marries nine women, and the emperor marries twelve women." During the Qin Dynasty, there were even titles such as "Lady in the Palace, Beauty, Fair Person, Eight Sons, Seven Sons, Elder Attendant, Younger Attendant," etc. During the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, even more titles were added, such as Jieyu and Zhaoyi, totaling fourteen grades. Zhong Changtong said: "In the palaces of dukes and marquises, there are hundreds of beauties, and in the homes of rural scholars, there are dozens of concubines." These are all true and reliable facts, and we don't need to cover up for the ancients. As for the implementation of laws and regulations, such as the law of inheritance and the provisions of "recognizing concubines as members of the family," the law clearly protected polygamy. Therefore, it is not "overstated" to say that "the law protects it in many ways"!</p>
<p>Since the abolition of the law of inheritance in the twentieth year of the Republic of China, up to the recent promulgation of the new criminal law, the relationship between the law of our country and women has indeed been considerably improved. However, in the current society, can the so-called "social perception" represent the perception of the general society?</p>
<p>Second, Article 239 of the new criminal law is indeed a crime that can only be prosecuted upon complaint. If the spouse condones or forgives the adultery, they may not file a complaint. If the young master has a new love, and the original spouse does not file a complaint, then the young master is still innocent. In other words, there is this law, but women will not use it, do not use it, or do not want to use it. This is not that the law is ineffective, but that women are voluntarily giving up. However, according to general common sense, unless she is an idiot, disabled, or insane, she will never condone her spouse committing adultery or even marrying someone else. From the standpoint of freedom of marriage, if one party has a new love, the other party does not need to be overly attached. Moreover, sexual love is always exclusive. Knowing that the husband has a new love but still being attached—euphemistically called condoning or forgiving, and being a "nominal couple"—there must be unavoidable difficulties! When most women still regard marriage as a lifelong nursing home, if the husband is imprisoned, it is tantamount to blocking or breaking their own rice bowl. Therefore, it is better to endure humiliation for the future than to seek temporary pleasure and vent anger. At the same time, even if they can file a complaint, if the other party (husband) is a person of power, the law will be helpless! As long as they don't "cover their ears," they won't be "unaware" of such facts!</p>
<p>Third, admittedly, there are many women who are eager to curry favor with the powerful or marry wealthy old men, willing to make "worthless sacrifices for vanity." However, in the current society, which is clad in a capitalist veneer but still retains feudal remnants internally and has a dilapidated economic structure, most women cannot make a living independently and naturally have to rely on men. The temptation of a luxurious society makes them tend towards vanity, which is a common problem in capitalist societies. Therefore, vanity has its economic roots and cannot be cured by women's self-improvement and self-encouragement. Moreover, when most women are simply commodities that can be bought and sold at will, and the powerful use their omnipotent money and mountain-like influence to buy a weak woman like a commodity, it takes no effort at all. Who dares to believe that "such things can be eradicated"?</p>
<p>Of course, we believe that "such things will eventually be eradicated." But this can only be realized when people are truly equal and free.</p>
<p>Only then will the law be a law that protects the interests of the general public. Therefore, we do not despise the law, but we should see through the current law, especially the relationship between the current law and women. The sociologist Bebel said: "The law of a country is the expression of the advantageous organization of the ruling class. Women are the oppressed and submissive 'sex,' so their position in the law is also the same. The law is passive and active. When distributing rights, it pays no attention to the oppressed; this is passive. When pointing out the submissive position of the oppressed and specifying various exceptions for its own convenience, it is active." (See Women and Society, p. 431). These words clearly tell us the relationship between law in an unequal society and the powerful and the oppressed, especially the relationship with women.</p>
<p>In short, to think that all current laws and social perceptions will never change due to power, and that inequality between men and women can be achieved as long as women strive for self-improvement and self-encouragement, is either ignorance of the social reality or an intentional distortion of the facts.</p>
<h3 id="e207">### Don't Marry a Man Who Has a Wife <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>Today's Shen Bao "Women's Corner" weekly published a commentary entitled "Law and Women," written by Jennie.</p>
<p>There are two points in this article that raise my doubts. First, the author said: "A powerful young master can have three wives and four concubines, and society praises and promotes it. The law protects it in many ways." These words are somewhat exaggerated and unrealistic. Not only does our country's law not explicitly protect polygamy, but it is also often criticized by society under the current circumstances. It is not because of the relationship of the young master that the social perception and legal provisions can be changed. Second, Article 239 of the new criminal law stipulates: "Whoever has a spouse and commits adultery with another person shall be sentenced to imprisonment for up to one year..." This is a crime that can only be prosecuted upon complaint, and if the spouse condones or forgives it, they may not file a complaint. Therefore, it is believed that this new law has failed if the young master has a new love and the original spouse does not file a complaint. We dare not say so.</p>
<p>In short, what we hope for from the women's world is that women themselves will strive for self-improvement and self-encouragement, and hold the principle of "not marrying a man who has a wife." Then such things can be eradicated. Otherwise, because of temporary vanity, not only is the sacrifice worthless, but it also exposes the weakness of women.</p>

<h3 id="e208">### Section 5: Prostitution and Trafficking in Women <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Jun Hui</p>
<p>Prostitution is not a phenomenon unique to capitalist society. Large-scale prostitution systems also existed in the era of slave economies and feudalism. However, in the era of capitalism, it has gained a more widespread social foundation.</p>
<p>Capitalism turns women's bodies into a major commodity on the market, making them subject to the laws of commodity circulation like bacon, rubber, and cotton. On the one hand, people who cannot get marital satisfaction under the "sacred" monogamy system and the vast number of forced celibates—such as soldiers, students, and workers—need to satisfy momentary pleasure without any responsibility for women's bodies. At the same time, on the other hand, fallen aristocratic women, bankrupt peasant women, and unemployed female workers are forced by hunger and cold to sell their bodies. They are concentrated in capitalist prostitution enterprises through various agents. Thus, the process of supply and demand circulation is accurately implemented. In this way, the "human flesh market" of capitalist society is formed.</p>
<p>In capitalist society, because the profits of prostitution enterprises are particularly large, merchants who only care about profit sell women and run prostitution businesses in various ways. On the one hand, they buy young and beautiful "cash cows," and on the other hand, they attract customers who are willing to pay. In public brothels, tea houses, theaters, dance halls, and other places, human flesh trading is openly or secretly practiced. There are high-ranking officials, judges, politicians, gentlemen, and soldiers, and even the core figures of the anti-prostitution movement become their customers.</p>
<p>Regarding the capitalist enterprise form of prostitution, Professor Plekhanov, the author of "European Prostitution," provides very interesting information. He first pointed out the trade routes of livelihood commodities: "Most prostitutes are exported from Hungary, Galicia, Poland, and Romania, and transported to Brazil, Argentina, South America, and Asia Minor." He also said: "In Budapest, it takes 500,000 kronen to open the latest brothel. In Paris, the annual income of a second-rate prostitution enterprise reaches 70,000 francs. A newly operated brothel in Berlin has a capital of one million marks, and it is said that it distributed a 20% dividend in 1912."</p>
<p>Thus, in capitalist society, prostitution is a "low-risk, high-return" enterprise, and this enterprise also provides considerable assistance to national finance. The memory of the so-called "menstrual tide" of prostitutes in Foshan, Guangdong, a few months ago who wanted to be exempted from paying flower taxes is still fresh in our minds. This so-called "flower tax" is the same in all countries, and it is something that is exploited from prostitutes to enrich the national treasury. Therefore, the state has the responsibility to protect the prostitution industry that pays taxes. On the other hand, because the "human flesh market" is too exposed to the ugliness of this civilized society, they often use a moral "veil" to cover it up. They either issue government orders to prohibit prostitution, or launch mass anti-prostitution movements to abolish it. But this is like Don Quixote fighting windmills, and it eventually fails. The more they want to cover it up, the more the ugliness is exposed.</p>
<p>Originally, the commodification of women's bodies and the commodification of human labor belong to the same category. In a society where the "labor market" exists, the so-called "human flesh market" will inevitably follow. If it is wrong for women to sell their bodies, then it is also wrong for workers to sell their blood and sweat! However, in the eyes of the ruling class, the public circulation of these living commodities is not only "unsightly" but also "damages public morals," so they come up with various methods of suppression to decorate the moral facade of society.</p>
<p>But when they cannot cover up this ugly social phase, they retreat and look for a theoretical basis to rationalize the prostitution system. But this basis is also found in women! Dr. Lobano, a famous German hygiene scholar, explained the inevitability and perpetuity of the prostitution system as follows:</p>
<p>"Women's prostitution exists in any nation and any era, and it cannot be abolished. Because this system is effective for sexual intercourse and originates from human nature. The motivation for prostitution is mostly due to the innate weakness of women. Just as there are genius idiots, giant dwarfs, and ordinary mediocre people in a nation, due to the pranks of creation, there are abnormal people who must prostitute themselves." (Women and Society)</p>
<p>This is obviously an attempt to place the responsibility for the ugly behavior of society on women and make the profitable prostitution enterprise a rational existence. At the same time, this is the consistent view of all those who defend this society.</p>
<p>In our opinion, the phenomenon of prostitution did not exist when women first appeared in this world. Although the Bible says that Eve is the devil who tempts men, in the primitive matriarchal society of communal production and consumption, women did not have "innate weaknesses," and there was no prostitution system. It was only in the patriarchal era when most people engaged in production and a few people specialized in consumption that prostitution was discovered. But we are absolutely unwilling to push the responsibility for this social evil onto men, but should push it onto the unreasonable social system.</p>
<p>In short, the prostitution system is something that is bound to arise in a society dominated by the propertied and male power. Therefore, launching a so-called anti-prostitution movement in a society of propertied people and attempting to eliminate it is only a delusional dream. We believe that prostitution is not based on human sacrifice and the weakness of women, nor is it something that "coexists with heaven and earth." When it comes to a society where no one is allowed to eat without working, just like the primitive matriarchal era where everyone produces and everyone consumes, the prostitution system will also be eliminated along with all other unreasonable systems, which can be asserted!</p>

<p>— Su Hong</p>
<p>——Her? She wants to take everything from me. This thing, "Mom! Give it to me." That thing, "Mom! Give it to me." I tell you, she even wants to take my spinning wheel." Pointing to a spinning wheel in front of the door, she continued, "Indeed, she was born into a hard life. Your brother-in-law used to work for others, but he got jaundice last year and hasn't recovered yet. The whole family relies on your sister to scratch and crawl for a living. Fortunately, her eldest daughter is grown up. She's thirteen this year. She said that after the younger siblings go to sleep at night, she can have the eldest daughter spin yarn for others and earn some money."</p>
<p>Xiuzhen shrank her body further into the quilt.</p>
<p>Mother began to take off her clothes and sat in the quilt, feeling for lice in her collar.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the sister-in-law next door started hitting the child, the floor thumped, and she cursed:</p>
<p>——You little devil, you spilled water again. Do you know that in this cold weather, if the quilt gets wet, how are we going to sleep?"</p>
<p>——Grandma! Grandma! I'm dying of pain!" the child screamed sharply.</p>
<p>——Stop hitting him, he's already spilled it, what's the use of hitting him?" Mother said loudly.</p>
<p>——Don't interrupt, if I don't hit him, he'll spill it again next time. Will you spill it next time? Tell me!" The sister-in-law said hatefully. Then there was the sound of whipping again.</p>
<p>——Say it, say it! "I won't spill it next time," say it and I won't hit you." Mother taught her eldest grandson.</p>
<p>After a round of beatings and scoldings, it seemed that the child had admitted his mistake. For a moment, it was quiet again.</p>
<p>The light was very small, the oil was almost burned out. Usually, if Mother wasn't doing anything, she would blow out the light when she went to sleep. Now, for her daughter's sake, she got up again, poked the wick up a bit, and added some oil.</p>
<p>——Oil is really expensive." Mother said, "In the past, a hundred coins could last for many days, but now it burns out in a few days. The more I save, the faster it runs out. Sometimes I even go to bed in the dark!" She put down the curtain, startling the rats, which scurried around on top of the curtain. The cat lying at the foot of the bed was startled and jumped up. The rats squeaked.</p>
<p>——Why are you still keeping a cat?" Xiuzhen asked.</p>
<p>——How can I not keep one? The rats are so hateful, they bite everything to pieces." Mother suddenly smiled. "My cat is very well-behaved. Every day it always drags a few rats, and I don't need to feed it." Speaking of food, she thought of rice. "Rice is still so expensive! Two dimes can't even buy a liter of rice. … Sigh, we are suffering too much. Your brother can't find a job, and he hasn't even sent a letter back. I don't even know where he is."</p>
<p>——How is sister-in-law coping?" Xiuzhen asked.</p>
<p>——You'll know slowly. It's time to sleep."</p>
<p>Mother took off her cotton clothes and slowly lay down in the quilt, closing her mouth tightly as if she had fallen asleep comfortably.</p>
<p>But Xiuzhen still had her eyes open, and it seemed like there was a worm crawling in her brain. She clearly heard the watchman strike the third watch.</p>
<p>(3)</p>
<p>Mother sat on the porch basking in the sun, her small feet resting on a "tiger head" (a basket made of yellow mud, which can hold charcoal fire. Poor people in the countryside mostly use this to keep warm). Her mouth kept chanting Buddhist scriptures. Xiuzhen sat next to her mother, her hands folded, like a monkey.</p>
<p>The sister-in-law ran out, carrying a one-year-old child in one arm and a five- or six-year-old boy in the other, with a large bundle of diapers under her arm, dragging her feet. She put the child next to Mother and hung the diapers one by one on the bamboo pole.</p>
<p>Another child suddenly shouted inside: "Mom! I want to get up! Mom!..."</p>
<p>The sister-in-law moved the bamboo pole to a place where the sun was shining, and scolded anxiously:</p>
<p>——You little devil, I was just about to dress you and get you up, but you said no. Now I'm busy doing things, but you want to get up. You little devil, where do I have the time! I haven't even borrowed rice for lunch yet! You little devil, you keep shouting, even if we're not poor, you'll shout us into poverty."</p>
<p>Mother put down her rosary and hurried in, saying repeatedly, "Baby! Grandma will dress you, don't cry, come with Grandma to bask in the sun."</p>
<p>Young Mistress Wang and her maid also carried out a small table, preparing to make silver ingots in the sun. The sister-in-law changed her face and said a few polite words:</p>
<p>——Young Mistress Wang! You're really good at it, making silver ingots in this cold weather."</p>
<p>——If I don't do it, it'll be too late. Tomorrow is already the end of the month. Once it's past the twentieth, I won't have time to do it. It's a little busier these days..."</p>
<p>——Oh! Young Mistress Wang!" The sister-in-law leaned her head into Young Mistress Wang's ear and said in a low voice, "Lend me two liters of rice."</p>
<p>——I don't have any extra rice. I only exchanged half of this year's rent rice. Of course, I won't have enough to eat myself next year." (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e212">On the Education of Talents <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ren</p>
<p>Some say that the disease of education in China today lies in the lack of its popularization. Therefore, the people's wisdom cannot be improved, the training of citizens cannot be implemented, production technology cannot be improved, the people's livelihood and economy cannot be developed, and the national concept and global vision cannot be established. Therefore, the advocacy of universal education or compulsory education is indeed the goal of future education, which is almost self-evident and leaves no room for rebuttal. However, observing the trends of modern world politics, the strength of a country is not only due to the improvement of the general people's knowledge, but also relies on the grand plans and strategies of outstanding leaders. That is to say, the use of "power" and "ability" must go hand in hand without conflict, so that they complement each other, and only then can the country have hope of being well-governed.</p>
<p>Based on this argument, we can know that popular education is to improve the general people's wisdom, and we must devote all our efforts to promote its success; and in addition to popular education, we must also focus on the education of talents at the same time. The education of talents is to cultivate the nation's capable people. The country must have good politicians to handle political affairs, scientists to create inventions, and educators, writers, and entrepreneurs, etc., each standing at the forefront of society, in order to lead the people of the whole country onto the road to prosperity. Therefore, it is said that the talent education movement and the popular education movement should be given equal importance and should not be biased.</p>
<p>Are the young people who are currently receiving university education or the prospective doctors who are gilded abroad the capable people of the country we are talking about? I think probably no one would dare to make a judgment! To be honest, more than 99% of those who receive higher education today are children of the bourgeoisie. Although there are no shortage of good young people who are dedicated to learning, but we also dare not say that there are definitely no people who rely on the legacy of their parents and brothers to fool around. As for the general poor children, most of them do not have the economic ability to provide higher education or even secondary education. However, are there no talents among them who are more intelligent, more self-loving, more hardworking, and more hopeful than the children of the bourgeoisie who have received higher education? In mountain villages and farmhouses, I don't know how many of the country's capable people are floating up and down like insects! The burying of talents is not only a loss to oneself and one's family, but also a great loss to the society and the people. It is heartbreaking to talk about.</p>
<p>Today, the national crisis is becoming more and more urgent, and the capable people to save the country are even more insufficient. The cultivation of talents cannot be delayed. Moreover, although popular education is a major plan for establishing the country, the results are still in the future. Today, we can only quickly and rigorously implement the urgent talent education, and select and assist young people who can be the national instrument. Within ten years, the country's future may rely on this to have the opportunity to revive!</p>
<p>The political significance of talent education is as described above. Even from the perspective of education itself, in a country with very weak national economic strength like ours, instead of cultivating talents for national use, we are simply manufacturing a few high-level consumers or even engaging in promoting foreign goods, indirectly promoting the country's fate to danger, this is even if it is not a waste of educational efficiency, it must also bear the serious crime of being a sycophant and neglecting national affairs!</p>
<p>Therefore, we advocate that today's university education should not only rectify its content, but also tidy up its members. In a time of urgent need for materials, we can no longer allow a few young masters and misses to use it as a tool to muddle through and cheat diplomas. It must be known that today's higher education is the place to cultivate the most responsible cadres and talents to save the country in the current stage. One more bastard is one less arm to save the country, and one less point of strength to save the country. In this critical moment of survival, can we still perfunctorily and superficially gloss over things as before?</p>
<p>As for the methods of concentrating and selecting talents, I propose that among the graduating students of secondary schools in various provinces who have excellent academic performance, conduct, physique, and perseverance, conduct another concrete test (there must be more reliable standards, such as intelligence tests, physical examinations, ideological tests, etc.), select the best materials, and eliminate the next (the same is true for elementary school to secondary school). Once admitted, if there is no economic ability, give free or loan methods. This can be said to be the country's investment. In the future, as long as it can produce a Washington or other great figures who can seek welfare for the country and the people, the profits obtained will definitely be able to repay the capital and have more than enough.</p>
<p>I am not against popular education, on the contrary, I absolutely admit that only universal national education can place the country's fate on a rock. But at the same time, I firmly advocate that for the sake of the necessary to save the country, we must urgently engage in the selection, assistance, and education of talents!</p>

<h3 id="e213">Obtaining Tobacco and Alcohol License <a href="#e213" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c213" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">213</a></h3>
<p>— Yang Hua</p>
<p>Probably the year before last, a friend Mr. X in the world of fame and fortune was honorably appointed as the chief of the ××× Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Collection Branch; lacking a "capable person" among his staff, he asked me to temporarily act as the chief of internal affairs. I am an "outsider" to taxation, and at the same time not a capable person, so I was worried and dared not take the job lightly. But on second thought: experience is learned, what does it matter? So I stepped into the tax agency and started working as a civil servant!</p>
<p>Before taking office, Mr. X instructed me to go to the provincial bureau to collect tobacco and alcohol licenses, tax payment certificates, etc., and told me: you can give the workers some tip money as appropriate. I thought this was a very ordinary thing, at most like receiving handouts at school, what is so rare about it!</p>
<p>When I arrived at the reception room of the provincial bureau, I took out the business cards of Mr. X and myself and gave them to the receptionist, saying that I wanted to meet the head of the general affairs section to collect things. There were two receptionists, one fat and one thin, and they both casually glanced at me in unison, and after a long time, hummed a sentence from their noses: "The head of the general affairs section is not easy to meet." I immediately retorted: "Because of official business, how can it be difficult to meet?" The fat one ignored me and went about his own business, only the thin one was still holding the business card, making a gesture of wanting to speak but not speaking. I felt that I had underestimated them too much at first, so I put on a smiling face and very politely told him that I was sent by Mr. X, and hoped for his help in everything. His face gradually became kind, only asking why Director X did not come in person. At that time, I was like touched the mechanism, understood their psychology, and said very generously: "I can represent Director X, and if you two help, of course I will treat you to tea. ......"</p>
<p>Before I could finish my words, the fat one immediately turned his face: "Easy to say, easy to say, we should serve Director X's representative, I think Director X's representative is all official business, this time going to the bureau must be very important."</p>
<p>I was also happy to brag at the time: "I dare not say that. But Director X and I have been friends since childhood, and I have always done better than him, this time he insisted on me going to help, it's really embarrassing! ......"</p>
<p>They listened even more comfortably than I said, the thin one quickly handed me a "company brand": "This cigarette is not good, please wronged the representative!"</p>
<p>After I finished smoking, I took out two five-yuan bills from my body and put them on the reception desk, and at the same time stated that it was just tea money, and there would be a supplement in the future. Their mouths were full of: don't! don't! While their hands touched the banknotes and stuffed them into their pockets. Finally, they said very humbly: "We two brothers originally did not dare to accept the representative's money, but if we failed your kindness, we would be impolite." Then they asked with a very sincere attitude: "How many places is the representative going to spend today?"</p>
<p>His question really stumped me, I didn't understand the truth in this officialdom,</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>and I don't need to prepare for the expense of this receiving license. I vaguely promised that only friends who can really help can have expenses. The fat one shook his head and said: "No! No! Our provincial bureau is very difficult to let out a few directors a year, many people like us have no salary, and we can only hope for a new director, to earn a little money, and Director × is a good vacancy this time, how can they slip through?"</p>
<p>This remark naturally has other effects, but it makes sense, and I felt that if the two of them colluded with many people to surround me, it would be difficult to deal with. So I again stated that after the things were received, I would have to add a little tea money, and at the same time deliberately asked them how to do it. The fat one still shook his head, seemingly feeling very embarrassed: "I see it's impossible without money. You think, how can we two help?</p>
<p>The thin one thought for a long time before frowning and saying to the fat one: "Brother Fat, I think we two brothers will take on this matter, fortunately Representative × is not an outsider, and will always be able to take care of you and me in the future."</p>
<p>"You said it so easily! Take on, I don't want to take on? This is money ......"</p>
<p>"That's right. It's just that money is annoying!" The thin one then turned his head to me, "Representative, I think you should still take out some money, these people just want some money, you represent Director × in handling affairs, do you still begrudge this little tip? After you take over the job ... In short, we two will help you with the expenses, it's always cheaper than if you talk to them yourself. We two will help you to the end."</p>
<p>At this time, the two of them looked like Laurel and Hardy in my eyes, one pretending to be stupid and the other pretending to be clever. I was being played by them, and I felt so angry that I just wanted to scold them to my heart's content, but I hadn't received the things yet, and I didn't want to offend people. I thought of the story of the water-carrying worker in the yamen of the tyrant wanting to compare his size with the county magistrate, but it made me laugh secretly. I thought that I couldn't get away from the money anyway, so I took out another ten-yuan bill. With this, the two of them were happy, and immediately told me the method of dealing with it, and at the same time called the young worker in charge of the tax票 in the general affairs section to introduce me. This man's surname was Chen, and he was at most eighteen years old. I thought he was very young and thought he was a newbie who was easy to deal with, but I didn't know that he was very careful and asked me for money soon after meeting, and also said that he could not only lead me to see the head of the general affairs section, but also handle the license and tax payment certificate. He can help me to get it faster, so that no other difficulties will occur. I was really not happy to hear his long list of words, in the final analysis, it was nothing more than asking for money.</p>
<p>After he satisfied his request, he led me to the general affairs section. When I saw the head of the section, I took out my usual diplomatic means and explained that I was just here to collect things first, and Director × will definitely come to say goodbye tomorrow morning. After all, the head of the section was not like the receptionist, and he did not make things difficult for me, so he ordered Chen to clean up the things I should receive. But there were a lot of things, and they couldn't be sorted out for a while, so he called me to pick them up in the afternoon.</p>
<p>When I arrived at the reception room of the provincial bureau in the afternoon, the two fat and thin guys were really polite to me: Director Representative, they shouted so sincerely that I was really embarrassed, and they repeatedly urged Chen to clean up faster. I thought this was the price of the twenty-yuan bill, and the saying that "money can make the devil push the millstone" also has a considerable truth. But soon I encountered an important difficulty. The receiving and dispatching office, the tax section of the workers came a total of more than ten; this congratulations, that congratulations, you take cigarettes, I hand tea, so that the coffee table in front of me can not be put down. Although I was a little embarrassed in my heart, I was very calm on the surface, so I followed the method that the receptionist told me, and never showed my attitude. Whatever they talked about, I talked about, fortunately I knew a little about the truth on the road, and I didn't feel any difficulty. After prolonging like this for more than an hour, Chen ran over to call me to the general affairs section to count the things. At this time, the head of the section was not there, and the people in charge greeted me a few words, and then asked why Director × didn't come. At this time, I had gained a lot of experience and knew that I couldn't find a few good people in the tax agency, so I deliberately said that I had just called to ask Director ×, and he said that he would come over immediately to say goodbye to the colleagues in the provincial bureau. They were also half-believing. Then I quickly counted the things and asked Chen to send them out the door. At this time, the friends who had offered me tea and cigarettes were all patrolling at the door, as if preventing criminals from escaping. I shouted for the rickshaw to move things, and applied the last treasure that Da gave me: "Director × told me: There are no expenses for everyone today, and he will come tomorrow to invite everyone to drink tea. He has not said goodbye to the head of the bureau!"</p>
<p>At this time, the two fat and thin receptionists made a face at me again: "Please convey my regards to Director ×, we will give him congratulations and ask for tip money tomorrow!"</p>
<p>It was not easy to break through the siege and jump on the rickshaw, and my heart was still pounding. I thought it was not easy to enter and leave the gate of the tax agency!</p>

<h3 id="e214">The Recovery of the British Economy During the Economic Panic <a href="#e214" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c214" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">214</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Shide</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the world economic panic in 1929, the various imperialist countries have been increasingly trapped in the distress of depression. In order to alleviate their various crises, they have implemented various artificial methods in an attempt to restore the economy. However, those non-fundamental artificial methods cannot fundamentally eliminate this widespread and deeply developing disaster of economic panic, and at most can only make the situation of certain industrial sectors fairly good, and this improvement is only temporary. This situation is most obvious in the United States under Roosevelt's recovery policy; at the same time, it can also be clearly seen in the British economy in the past two years. Now, what we want to study is the temporary recovery of the British economy.</p>
<p>In 1932, the recovery of the British economy gradually began, and the speed of this recovery was very slow until the second half of 1934, and it can be said that it had fundamentally stopped by the end of the year. The index of the British Department of Commerce clearly shows this development process - the Department of Commerce's industrial production index (1928 equals 100); at the same time, the magazine "Economist" published such a chart (monthly average of 1924 equals 100):</p>
<p>1934</p>
<p>The first table shows that the British production index has been developing upward since 1933, but this development trend slowed down and even stopped in the second half of 1934; the latter table not only shows the same situation as the previous table, but also shows that the most important thing in the so-called recovery of the British economy is the increase in the construction and automobile production index.</p>
<p>However, the main reasons for the sharp increase in residential construction are, first, the low interest rate in long-term credit, and second, the low construction costs in the panic year, which is clearly shown in the table below (1924 equals 100)——</p>
<p>Finally, what enabled the British construction industry to recover to a certain extent was the low price of the pound.</p>
<p>The question of whether such a development of the construction industry can continue is entirely determined by the condition of British workers; if the lives of workers cannot be improved, if they cannot improve their housing, then the development of the construction industry in the panic year will become a temporary phenomenon and cannot continue. British politicians have been singing the song of removing slums and improving workers' housing in the election competition, but until now there is still a huge army of unemployed; these unemployed people can't even solve the problem of employment, so how can they leave the slums and how can they improve their housing? Even the employed workers, because of the low wages and poor living conditions, cannot talk about improving their housing at all. In this way, the development of the construction industry, which occupies an important position in the so-called recovery, will inevitably be temporary. In fact, from the end of last year to the present, the British construction industry has not shown a development trend.</p>
<p>Secondly, there is the issue of increased automobile production.</p>
<p>The increase in British automobile production in recent years is clearly shown in the table below——</p>
<p>Passenger Small Cars Large Cargo Cars</p>
<p>First nine months of 1929 182.347 56.458</p>
<p>First nine months of 1931 158.997 67.30</p>
<p>First nine months of 1932 171.244 61.475</p>
<p>From October 1932 to August 1933 208.380 59.978 From October 1933 to August 1934 241.671 78.601</p>
<p>What stimulated the increase in British automobile production was mainly the British government's reduction in taxes on automobile owners. But in any case, the need for automobiles is always limited, so whether British automobile production can continue to increase in the future is still a big question.</p>
<p>In this way, since the development trend of the construction industry and the automobile industry, which occupy a major position in the so-called recovery, cannot be optimistic, then the essence and future of the so-called recovery of the British economy is not difficult to see.</p>
<p>In the so-called recovery of the British economy, in addition to the construction industry and the automobile industry showing a temporary development trend, the shipbuilding industry has also improved slightly. But this improvement is not due to the improvement of the general industry, but mainly the result of the expansion of the British naval armament. At present, the economic state of the United Kingdom, on the one hand, because of many artificial reasons, although certain industrial sectors have a temporary recovery phenomenon, the panic of the general industrial sector is still continuing to develop, whether the textile industry, the coal mining industry, or the original shipbuilding industry, the excess of fixed capital is more than at any time. As for foreign trade, there have also been several improvements in recent years. According to the investigation, the export of finished industrial products in the United Kingdom has shown the following increasing trend in the past three years——</p>
<p>Last quarter of 1932 69.0 (unit million pounds)</p>
<p>Last quarter of 1933 75.2</p>
<p>Last quarter of 1934 81.1</p>
<p>However, if we compare the recent exports of the United Kingdom with the pre-panic level, the situation is very different. "Eonomist" published a comparative table of numbers on January 19 this year (unit million pounds)</p>
<p>What the numbers in the table above show is that although the exports of the United Kingdom have increased somewhat in recent years, they are still relatively reduced compared with the pre-panic level: This fact can be understood more clearly if we consider the recent decline in prices. As for the export of various important commodities, the situation is also very uneven. In fact, the export of cotton cloth in 1934 was somewhat reduced compared with 1933, and if compared with the pre-panic 1928, it was only a little more than half: the export of woolen fabrics is increasing, as are automobiles and pig iron; but the export of coal is now still stagnating at the very low level of two years ago.</p>
<p>From these actual situations, the so-called recovery of the British economy is in fact artificial, partial, and not the upward development of the general economy; moreover, due to the inability to solve the unemployment problem, the inability to improve the lives of workers, and the increasing decline in the digestive power of the domestic market, this artificial and partial so-called recovery in the United Kingdom is only temporary and cannot continue to be maintained and developed.</p>
<p>The Great Shanghai Scenery</p>
<h3 id="e215">Contagious Disease Hospital <a href="#e215" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c215" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">215</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Cong</p>
<p>The sun had just barely poked half its head out, and the asphalt roads on the ground were already glistening with sweat. Leaving home, one felt as if being roasted by fire; sweat oozed from the pores like asphalt on the road, and before walking even a few dozen steps, one's clothes were as soaked as a drowned chicken, clinging tightly to the skin.</p>
<p>After enduring half an hour of sweltering heat, what unfolded before my eyes was an environment of towering trees and tranquility, akin to a nunnery. Beneath the canopy of leaves peeked an endless stretch of black fence, tightly enclosing several new buildings that appeared to have just been completed. The national flag fluttered high on both sides of the gate. A thought lurking in my mind seemed to realize that this was the "Shanghai Municipal Contagious Disease Hospital" I was about to visit.</p>
<p>"This Contagious Disease Hospital was originally the 'Zhabei Public Hospital' before the 'January 28th Incident.' It was later destroyed by gunfire and taken over by the Bureau of Health, which transformed it into the current hospital. The new buildings in front were only recently completed, and considering the city's population, the wards still seem insufficient." An employee, after exchanging pleasantries with me in the reception room, pointed to a row of light yellow buildings in front and told me this.</p>
<p>We left the reception room and first took a walk around the open space. The hospital occupies an area of about twenty acres; it is surrounded by a black fence, and the courtyard is full of tall trees that block out the sun. The grass on the ground is like a carpet, green and boundless. Gusts of clear wind blew</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>through the woods, and one felt as light as if having laid down a burden weighing hundreds of pounds.</p>
<p>The southern part of the hospital is an old-style building, facing the newly completed modern hospital, a rectangular structure with light yellow walls, the color of which appears even more harmonious and beautiful under the sunlight. The three buildings can accommodate approximately one hundred and forty patients. The wards are divided into first, second, and third class, with the first and second class located on the second floor, and the third class downstairs. In addition to being divided by class, the wards are also divided into pediatric wards, male and female wards, intensive care units, and other types. Other facilities such as dining rooms, nurses' offices, patient lounges, and toilets are all located within these buildings.</p>
<p>The living environment for patients is indeed designed to meet hygienic principles in every aspect. For example, in addition to the regular meals prepared by the "main kitchen," there is also a steam stove room in the hospital, specifically for patients to cook snacks and boil hot water at any time. For patient hygiene, in addition to the existing washrooms, a special type of bathtub is provided. This bathtub is shaped like a car, with four wheels underneath that can be freely moved. If a patient is too ill to move, the bathtub can be pushed into the room for bathing, providing much convenience to the patient. One building is divided into dozens of rooms, and the equipment in each ward has been carefully designed with artistry. The color of the walls in the rooms is the same light yellow as the outside, but the paint is applied more delicately. The furnishings include small tea tables, small desks, and electric bells, occupying very little space, leaving a large area in the middle for patients to move around. The electric lights in each room are installed in the middle of the walls, covered with white, non-glare glass panels more than a foot long and four inches wide, emitting a soft and serene light; this demonstrates the well-considered design for the patients' physical and mental health and eyesight.</p>
<p>The charging method for inpatients here is determined according to each individual's economic circumstances. The first-class ward costs six yuan per day, and one family member is allowed to accompany the patient, but they must pay two yuan per day for room and board. The second-class ward costs two yuan per day. The third-class ward is much cheaper, costing only thirty cents per day. The patients admitted here are mostly those suffering from the following infectious diseases: typhoid fever, scarlet fever, meningitis, cholera, dysentery, plague, diphtheria, typhus, smallpox, and others.</p>
<p>Their original plan was to have one building for each type of infectious disease, which is what is called an "isolation hospital." However, this plan cannot be realized for the time being due to the current shortage of buildings. Because according to their classification of medical subjects, there are nine types, which would require nine buildings, but currently only two have been completed and are habitable, while the other seven are still under construction. Therefore, to see the success of this grand plan will probably require some time.</p>

<h3 id="e216">Adventures in the Land of Ghosts <a href="#e216" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c216" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">216</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Zhaoxin</p>
<p>In the minds of most people, "Fengdu" is generally considered a place haunted by ghosts, especially those vegetarian Buddhist women, who, upon hearing the name Fengdu, would shudder, believing it to be the land of ghosts, where everyone goes to live after death. In ancient inherited myths, it is also said that "it is a land of ghosts, and it is even rumored that it is a place where humans and ghosts live together. It is said that there is also buying and selling there. When customers buy things, the people in the shops first throw the received copper coins into a water basin prepared in advance. If the copper coins sink, the people in the shops know that they are human and give them human goods. If the copper coins float, they are not human, but a ghost, and they give them ghostly goods." Liao Shiyi also recorded such a story: "×××, a magistrate of 'Fengdu,' after taking office, heard that there was a very deep cave in the area, said to be the residence of the King of Hell. The magistrate did not believe it and went to explore it with his attendants. At first, it was very dark, but suddenly it became bright, as if illuminated by daylight. Suddenly, he saw a person dressed like the King of Hell in a drama, bowing to the magistrate and inviting him in, with a very respectful demeanor, saying, 'I have been waiting for a long time. Please take office and take over immediately.' The magistrate was terrified, repeatedly kowtowing, saying, 'My family still has an old mother. How can I do this?' The King of Hell smiled and said, 'It is the will of Heaven.' He then took out a book and pointed to it, saying, 'It has already been recorded in the book.' The magistrate looked at it and saw the book read: '××× enters the underworld alive.'" Because of this record, it has become an ironclad case, firmly believing that "Fengdu" is haunted by ghosts, even the people of Sichuan would admit it.</p>
<p>So, is "Fengdu" a land of ghosts? In this era of scientific advancement, this question really needs to be debunked. Last year, I went on an expedition to Sichuan and passed through "Fengdu," so I stayed there for half a day to conduct a factual investigation, hoping to dispel this question that has persisted for thousands of years.</p>
<p>After leaving Chongqing, the ship arrived at "Fengdu" on the second day. After going ashore and walking not far, we arrived at the so-called "Fengdu." It is a high mountain, split into two in the middle, with a distance of about three or four zhang. The cliffs are thousands of feet high, and the situation is very dangerous, as if they are about to close together. Below, more than a hundred temples are built in a dense arrangement. We walked the three or four-li-long, three-foot-wide street several times, but we never saw a single person. Looking up, we only saw a patch of sky. The sun was about to climb over the mountain, and darkness had already descended on this land of locust trees. The high mountains on both sides seemed to be on the verge of collapsing, as if they could merge at any moment. The stalagmites were shaped like various demons, seeming to seize people and eat them. Anyone other than people like us would probably be frightened and run away immediately.</p>
<p>Before long, it became night here. Fortunately, we had prepared flashlights in advance, which we immediately put to use. Each and every one of the temples revealed a majestic appearance, resplendent in gold. The larger ones were similar to the Jingci Temple in Hangzhou, and the smaller ones were similar to those seen on the streets of Shanghai. However, we walked a long way on the street but never saw anyone walking, except for us. At this time, I looked at my watch, which read only three o'clock.</p>
<p>"Hey! What time is it on your watch?" I asked my companion, "Because mine is broken."</p>
<p>"What?" he exclaimed, "Is it only three o'clock and already dark?" But the short hands on several companions' watches clearly pointed to three o'clock.</p>
<p>Regardless, we straightened our chests, turned our brains, and tried to find more materials to enrich our exploration. We walked step by step onto the stone steps in front of the temples. The doors were closed but not locked, so we pushed them open like detectives, shining our flashlights inside. Several pairs of eyes searched inside like hunting dogs, and then we walked in step by step. The four walls were covered with various wooden puppets, all gilded, and there was nothing else. At this time, we felt unbearably cold and couldn't help but shiver a little. Going further in, we saw a person with disheveled hair, looking just like a ghost. If there were ghosts, I believe that the appearance of ghosts must be similar to his. We steadied our minds and looked at him. We saw his swarthy face set off by his disheveled long hair, wearing thick cotton clothes, barefoot, wearing a pair of straw sandals, with ten fingers as thick as carrots. There were also several bald guys next to him, all with sturdy bodies. We looked carefully for a while and then believed that these were all people, because if they were ghosts, they should have immediately dodged and disappeared when they saw us. They also looked at us with surprised eyes.</p>
<p>"Are you here to play?" An older man stood up to greet us, speaking in a pure Sichuan Xiajiang dialect.</p>
<p>"Yes! We are here to play," we replied, "Are you all from here?"</p>
<p>He nodded, invited us to sit down, and then I began to use conversation to find the materials we needed.</p>
<p>"Are there ghosts here?" I asked with a smile.</p>
<p>"Ghosts, we haven't seen them, but the people here all believe that there are, so we live in the temples all year round. Every morning when we get up, we all go to a small temple on the mountain to burn incense. The Bodhisattva there is called Xiaorenzi, and he is really effective! If you don't go to burn incense, then you can forget about having a peaceful day today. When you fall asleep, ghosts and demons will come to surround you. When you cook rice, the rice will turn into feces. Last time, some guests came to play, and they tried it on the spot. Clearly, they put in white rice, but after cooking for a while, when they lifted the pot lid, there was no trace of white rice in the pot, it had all turned into feces!"</p>
<p>We smiled and took out bread to eat, but none of it changed flavor.</p>
<p>"Why does it get dark at three o'clock?"</p>
<p>"Here, it doesn't get light until eleven o'clock in the morning, and it gets dark at three o'clock in the afternoon. There are only four hours of daylight, and the rest is darkness."</p>
<p>"How many families are there here?"</p>
<p>"There are about a hundred families, with five or six hundred people. This place has now been changed to 'Fengdu' County, and there is a county magistrate and a public security bureau, just like outside."</p>
<p>"So, is the county magistrate here?"</p>
<p>"No, we have only heard that there is a county magistrate, but we have never seen him. It is said that the county magistrate is because it is too hard, and he only takes the name, and never comes here in person. There are a dozen policemen, who live the same way as we do, except that they ask us for money and grain every year."</p>
<p>"Then do you also farm?"</p>
<p>"Of course, we do. Our fields are all on the mountains, and the harvest is good every year. Most of what is produced here is corn, which is shipped to Chongqing every year to sell. After selling it, we buy foreign cloth back to make clothes, and other miscellaneous items are also bought from there, but the road is too inconvenient! So it's hard to go there a few times a year."</p>
<p>"How long have you been living in 'Fengdu'? Why do you live in the temples?"</p>
<p>"We don't know! I only know that my father lived here, and I don't understand anything else!"</p>

<p>"Further on is Wushan, where they come together."</p>
<p>It was getting late, so we smiled and recited the lines "Having seen the sea, other waters are hard to call water; having seen Wushan, other clouds are not clouds," and then withdrew from the remote place, and retraced our steps back.</p>

<h3 id="e217">The Sin of a Single Strike <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>— Xin Zi</p>
<p>On July 17th, a certain publication carried a news item about a widow who remarried and injured her husband, the gist of which was that "Huang Hengbi already had a wife, and seventeen years ago, due to his work at the Chongming Post Office, he was on a long-distance assignment, separated by distant mountains and rivers. Therefore, he did not bring his family with him. Being alone in a foreign land with plenty of leisure time, he sought out a beautiful woman to relieve his loneliness. It happened that Xia Wu was newly widowed and not tolerated by her in-laws, so Huang purchased her marriage certificate from the Xia family for a price of one hundred and thirty yuan and built a golden house for her. Later, Huang was transferred back to the General Post Office, and the woman remained on Chongming Island. Huang initially provided for Wu's household expenses from time to time, but later, due to the larger expenses in Shanghai, he could not provide as generously as before. After three years, the woman traced him to Shanghai, made things difficult for him, and eventually went to his office to make trouble, injuring Huang with a wine bottle." The reporter of this publication used the words "innately shrewish" in the headline to judge the remarried widow, while Huang Hengbi seemed to have been forgiven in the reporter's writing.</p>
<p>In the current society where men still dominate everything, it is to be expected that the case should receive such an evaluation. Men can go anywhere to find a machine for sexual release for their own enjoyment, so like Huang Hengbi, even in the current system of monogamy, he can build a golden house, taking advantage of a person's family discord and economic distress to become a guest in their house. Ms. Jun Hui spoke most incisively about this illegal marriage phenomenon in her article "Modern Marriage and Divorce": "From the perspective of our women, this kind of union is completely sacrificing women's human rights to satisfy men's sexual life, which is extremely immoral. Men who live as concubines often have their legal wives at home, and when they are away from home due to their work, they use money, power, and other deceptive methods to lure women into illegal cohabitation.</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>
<h2>Page 22</h2>
<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>But when he gets tired of it, he discards them like worn-out shoes." For Huang Hengbi's immoral behavior, we should first condemn him for the sake of justice, but what we see in public opinion is the condemnation of the remarried "widow" for being "innately shrewish," and not the condemnation of Huang Hengbi for "trampling on women," which is very unfair!</p>
<p>The monogamous marriage system already has clear provisions in our grand laws, but what we see in the social phenomenon is that, in addition to one wife, men still have ways to engage in various polygamous practices behind the name of "one wife." Prostitution and cohabitation, are these not enough to illustrate the actual existence of polygamy? In the current capitalist society dominated by commodity economy, the concept of chastity is still one-sidedly existent, and the monogamous system is still nothing more than a means to bind women's chastity!</p>
<p>Huang Hengbi treated both his legal wife and Wu as consistently as "hotel-style sexual transaction" objects. He himself could be content wherever he was, whether on Chongming Island or in Shanghai, he could get sexual satisfaction. In the continuation of the sexual transaction relationship, he naturally used the supply of money as the only means to deceive the other party. Once the sexual transaction was interrupted (such as after Huang left Chongming), he even abandoned the disguise of monetary support! Wu has no status in law. After being abandoned by Huang, can she get fair legal relief? She can't. How will she cope? In general feudal women, perhaps they would sob and swallow their tears and hang themselves or take poison to find relief? This is naturally the behavior of the weak, but our remarried widow still has the courage to use a wine bottle to strike the "woman trampling" Huang Hengbi because of her "innate shrewishness." Let us imagine how much resentment and humiliation accumulated in the hearts of women for thousands of years is contained in this strike! However, this poor widow was finally judged with the crime of being "innately shrewish"!</p>

<h3 id="e218">Overseas Chinese Around the World (4) <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Minyi</p>
<p>(2) Overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia</p>
<p>Southeast Asia includes the Malay Peninsula, Indochina, and the East Indies. Now, we will describe the situation of overseas Chinese in these places separately.</p>
<p>Thailand. Thailand is located between French Indochina and British Malaya, on the Indochina Peninsula in Southeast Asia. As early as the Northern and Southern Dynasties, Thailand sent envoys to pay tribute to China. Its relationship with China must have been even more ancient. Up to now, there are more than three million overseas Chinese in Thailand, accounting for more than a quarter of the total population of Thailand and a third of the total number of overseas Chinese in the world. The status of overseas Chinese in Thailand in the world of overseas Chinese, and the relationship between overseas Chinese and the country of Thailand can be seen from this.</p>
<p>Most of the overseas Chinese in Thailand come from Guangdong and Fujian. They mostly engage in industry and commerce here, and they occupy a very important position in the Thai economy. Almost all of Thailand's important industries and businesses are in their hands. As we all know, the rice and mining industries are the main industries of Thailand, but according to a survey in 1919, in Bangkok alone, there were a total of 67 large rice mills, of which 56 were owned by Chinese. In addition, industries such as sugar manufacturing, timber, and pawnshops are also operated by overseas Chinese. If we only talk about the economic aspect, Thailand can be said to be the Thailand of overseas Chinese.</p>
<p>However, the colonial world of a country cannot continue to develop only by relying on the economic power and hard work of its expatriates. Therefore, the colonial policies of many modern independent countries are implemented under the political power of the state. China is a backward semi-colonial country, and it has never had a definite immigration policy, let alone how to help overseas Chinese scattered around the world. Although overseas Chinese in Thailand have such great power, China and Thailand have not yet established formal diplomatic relations. Therefore, the more the overseas Chinese develop in Thailand, the more they will be suppressed and excluded by the Thai government and unable to cope. In recent years, the Thai government has repeatedly promulgated immigration laws, repeatedly increasing the import tax for Chinese people to limit Chinese imports. What is even worse is the recent crackdown on overseas Chinese schools and the implementation of compulsory education to assimilate our compatriots, in the hope of assimilating our three million overseas Chinese into Thais and taking over our huge property. According to reports, in the past year alone, more than 70 overseas Chinese schools were closed by the Thai government. The industries and businesses operated by overseas Chinese are especially subject to heavy taxation, making it impossible for them to maintain themselves. Overseas Chinese are also prohibited and restricted from remitting money back home. In October of the year before last, a major tragedy of Thai police slaughtering overseas Chinese occurred in southern Thailand, killing dozens of people. Recently, our compatriots have been oppressed and returned in batches… All these are concrete manifestations of the Thai government's oppression of overseas Chinese. At present, the anti-Chinese movement in Thailand is still increasing. If we do not hurry up and find ways to deal with it, I am afraid that the three million overseas Chinese in Thailand will not be able to stand on their feet!</p>

<p>It has been a long time since Holland's Ai Luan has had her work seen. This time, Universal Pictures of the United States bought a good script and designated the great director Code Naumen and famous actors such as Raymond Milland, Henry O'Neill, Katherine Alisede, and child star Bebe Qisi. It can be called a perfect combination of talents, making the protagonist Sharon Ai Luan able to display her expressive genius. As for the photography, recording, background, and dialogue, the various technical excellences are secondary matters. At the same time, Universal's full-color artistic music short "Song of Welcoming Spring" will also be shown, and the latest dance step "Groller Clou dland" will be introduced. On the left is a shot of Sharon Ai Luan.</p>
