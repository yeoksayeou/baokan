<h3 id="c10">典當業復興問題 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— 磬</p>
<p>本市典當業同業公會近以同業營業淸淡。收益銳减。虧蝕不貲。其無法維持而停業者。踵趾相接。復以滿貨售價。僅及當本十之六成。例如一典每年滿貨平均以二萬元計。售價祇一萬二千元。卽須虧本八千元。顯係致命之傷。而每家年耗動逾萬金。全賴區區惟一之利息收入。奚能挹注補苴。維持不敝。長此以往。苟不亟謀挽救。不出二載。必至全體崩潰。盡行停業。為謀局部的自救計。籲請市政當局。准予改短當貨滿期為十二個月。俾免受當貨物。仍照向章作長期之保存。蓋近年受當貨物。當戶輒棄而不贖。居其大宗之衣服。因式樣變遷。退為陳舊已屬無人過問。重以物價慘落跌進當本。欲求不遭虧蝕而脫售。當然無望。若當貨滿期改短半年。則此項困難。可望稍减。卽典商之資金周轉。亦得稍轉靈活矣。</p>
<p>夫典當業之衰落。以我人所知。固不僅以本市為獨甚。更非最近之特殊現象。蓋近十年來。全國各地之典當業。無時無日。莫不趨向於沒落之途。惟以都市之感應稍遲。慘敗景象。至昨前兩年。始告顯露。卽典業中人。亦以掙扎無方。始出而作將伯之呼。聊冀挽劫運於萬一。此情此景。以視曩昔之聲勢。令人不無今昔之感。蓋當閉關時代。典當實先票號錢莊而握有金融商業之權威。公欵與私人游資。皆以典當為存放之尾間。卽重要商號。亦多與之有相當連絡。俾獲周轉之調劑。但自錢業代興。與當業不僅存欵業務。頓受打擊。卽原有之商業上地位。亦告喪失。所幸其主體業務。尚稱順利。影響不致過甚。然輓近數年。天災人禍。無時或己。農村經濟崩潰。不景氣襲擊全國。民間購買力。日形减弱。物價慘落。商貨停滯。市塲陷於凍結之狀態。環境旣惡劣如此。調劑細民金融之機關。安得不隨之而沒落乎。　抑今次所謂典當業問題。非僅限於上海一隅。內地鄉鎭其嚴重亦末見稱差。是故問題之癥結所在。亦為整個的而非局部的。嘗考典業制度。其組織之嚴密。在我舊式商業中。素稱獨步。惟該業中人。以保守性成。祇知墨守成規。故步自對。若與新興之金融機關相較。則組織上實不逮遠甚。是以欲謀典業之復興。如僅以滿期之改短為目的。恐不為功。似應先自制度改善入手。資金應設法充實。業務應酌量擴充。會計保管均宜相機改善。至若滿期利率。更宜富於彈性。視受當物件之性質。而酌定長短高下。其具體辦法。願與典當業共研討之。</p>

<p>三北態度軟化</p>
<p>三北公司、自七月一日起、首先將船員工薪减爲八折、滿五十元以上者一律折發、全體各船員、要求虞洽卿免减、虞初未允、後經各船員請求先發欠薪、再談减薪三北公司不能不有所躊躇、故其答復輪機會等三團體祇謂减薪一事、現正與各船員恊議當可得到雙方諒解的滿意解决、</p>

<p>南市西門方浜橋民國路共和影戲院、昨日下午五時五十分許、突吿失慎、全部房屋、焚燬殆盡、歷時一小時、始吿灌熄、當火熾時、該處沿民國路一帶交通、爲之斷絕者、約半小時之久、幸香閣警察所聞警後、飭警多名馳往維持治安、秩序井然、茲將詳情、分誌於后、</p>
<p>建造歷史</p>
<p>民國路方浜橋口第一六〇號共和影戲院、建於西歷一九一五年、產主係潘崇德堂、當建築時、規模並不宏大、內部佈置、亦屬平凡、惟其時南市華界方面、僅此一家、故營業尙佳、邇來租界方而各大影戲院先後樹立、美輪美奐、日趨科學化、該院經理張振山爲圖謀生存起見、乃於去年耗費二萬餘金、將房屋油漆一新、桌椅更換嶄新、內部改紙有聲機·影片機·拍納通·及代理木等、莫不應有盡有、但社會百業不景氣、該院營業、終於不振、緣於前月二十四日轉租於粵劇班、改演潮州戲、租費按月洋二千元、僅演夜戲、每晚七時開鑼、看客亦不擁擠、</p>
<p>忽吿火警</p>
<p>昨日下午五時四十分、樓上平項內、忽有黑烟冒出、爲粵劇班內一孩童瞥見、亟奔告賬房間、經理張振山、當用電話報吿西區救火會、斯時路人佇足、交通爲之斷絕、迨救火車馳來、已冒穿屋頂、烈燄飛騰、火勢不可收拾、當救火員裝置皮帶接水時、忽路側水龍頭內吿罄、逾十餘分鐘、方能汲水施救、斯時火光燭天、杯水車薪無濟於事、此皆水量不足之故、</p>
<p>交通阻碍</p>
<p>當火熾時、該處一帶華商三路及法商五路電車、停駛於陳英士塔畔者、約有十餘輛、宛如長蛇、交通阻隔、逾半小時之久、行人圍而觀者、幾途爲之塞、出事後該管沉香閣警察所所長沈振華飭巡官長警多名馳往、維持得力、故秩序頗佳、，當記者抵火塲時、瞥見火勢猛烈、濃烟如墨、救火員忙於工作、交通隔斷、祇得在人叢中觀看、</p>
<p>損失估計</p>
<p>嗣悉該院經理張振山寓居對面壽祥里十五號、乃繞道而至其家、據稱、共和影院開設將近二十年、此次不幸事件發生、損失殊大、估計約十餘萬元、聞粵劇班底方面、若全部焚去、須損失十萬左右、曾保火險一萬元、逐年營業、足以開支、自去年六月份至年底、虧蝕六千餘金、今年正月至現下、尙有盈餘、平時開演影戲、日夜塲收入約計二百餘元、每日開支僅八十餘元、折舊及購製生財、當可敷衍、</p>
<p>焚去五間</p>
<p>火塲延燒約二小時始經救火員灌熄、結果焚去五開間房屋、僅存賣票處樓面一角、賬房茶房二人、由崗警帶所申解公安總局核辦、</p>

<p>最近工部局警備委員會、曾接華北汽車保險公會函、主張對於出租汽車行駛速度、加以限制、據該函所稱、市上出租汽車、疾駛如飛、尤以界外馬路爲甚、每小時速率自四十五哩至五十哩、已屬司空見慣、因此肇禍之事、時有所聞、故擬對、因汽車肇事、情形至爲複雜、不能以速率一端而論、倘速率規定以後、遇有意外之事發生、即可視爲危險之至也、但爲禁止出租汽車、夏季兜風疾馳、避免危險保障人命起見、可令捕房人員、加以嚴厲注意、遇有汽車開駛過速、易肇危險之時、隨時報吿、加以控究、此事經警備委員祥細討論之後、深覺汽車行駛速度加以限制、在今日已屬落伍、極不宜於近代之需要、惟代理總巡所擬取締行車危險之辦法、尙屬可行、當即議决、由總巡通令界內各捕房、對於汽車行駛危險程度、加以特別注意、並得隨時舉發、以便拘究、再則除上述出租汽車之外、尙有運貨卡車、以及各國駐軍汽車、時有橫衝直撞、弁髦路章之處、亦應一律加以注意、並通知各國駐軍司令部、加以遏止、聞工部局董事會對於上列諸項、已加以通過照辦矣、</p>

<p>關於電車里及公共汽車、逾限載客一事、工部局警備委員會上月二十五日舉行會議時、代理總巡曾對於調查情形、及取締結果、有所報吿、據該代理總巡之意見、是項取締辦法、仍應繼續施行、一方對於電車及公共汽車載客是否逾限、仍應嚴厲檢查、遇有案情嚴重者、即予起訴、若係輕微違章、則予以相當之警吿、他一方面、倘電車公司或公共汽車公司、能採取下列二項辦法者、則對於行車章程第三十六欵第一節之遵守、即不致發生極端之困難矣、所謂三項辦法者、即（一）在上下辦公時間、每東客滿、即直駛不停、或不啟門、（二）每車客滿、乘客尙欲攀登者、車即停駛、俟後至者退出再開、（三）裝置記數旋轉機、使售票人能以一蹴足之力、立即將機停轉、乘客自不得再上、至於以上辦法施行之後、於乘客方面、有無不便之處、當會議時亦曾有人詢及、據代理總巡之所見、倘各公司能與警方、積極合作、即不致妨及乘客之便利云、此事經大致討論之後、當即决定採取代理總巡之建議、繼續取締電車及公共汽車逾限載客、隨時加以檢查、遇有案情嚴重時、即予起訴、或予以相當警吿、茲聞該項建議、日前己山董事會通過照辦矣、</p>

<p>— 珮瑜</p>
<p>一個人值多少錢？」這個問題很難得到正確的回答。例如烈烈轟轟做過一番大事業，對於社會人類有大貢獻大利益的人，所值多少，難以計算。庸庸碌碌，無所建樹，生不能有益於人類，死也無影響於社會的人，不值什麼，無可計算。假使以一個人能賺多少錢來估價，那麼一位費盡心血而發明一種有利人羣之物的發明家，所得到的錢，遠不及一個唱幾曲歌跳幾回舞的紅明星來得多。這種估價仍不正確。如欲正確的估價，非用化學分析的方法不可。用化學分析方法來分析普通人類的肉體，所得的結果，非常正確而公平。因爲不論貧富貴賤智愚良惡的人，都是一樣的。</p>
<p>根據英國勞遜博士的報吿，普通人類的肉體，平均計算值五先令，（約合華幣二元六角五分左右）因爲一個人的肉體內，所含有的水分，是以裝滿一隻有十加侖容量的桶，所含有的脂肪，足以做成七長塊肥皂，所含有的鉛，足以做成九千枝鉛筆，所含有的燐，足以做成二千二百個火柴頭，所含有的鎂，足以配成一服量的鹽，所含有的鐵，足以做成一隻中號大小的釘，所含有的石灰，足以塗白一隻養鷄的塒，所含有的硫磺，足以除掉一頭狗身上的蚤。</p>
<h3 id="c189">逭暑之一法—游泳 <a href="#c189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— 花鈴</p>
<p>天氣是一天熱似一天了，熱，熱，熱，電扇，汽水，冰其淋，甚麼都不能解除掉熱的威脅，躺着，汗還是像潮天的水泥地上那麼的瀋出來，潮黏黏的，怪難受。</p>
<p>但是，不用找急！我吿訴你，有好去處。在這個都市裏，有游泳池，還有，嗯，海濱浴塲。</p>
<p>我雖然不是象牙塔裏的公子哥兒，但因自幼兒生長於農村，在十歲左右時，便跟着哥哥，掮着木板門，在小河見裏玩着那一手，所以現在雖然漂泊進了都市來，不知怎的提到了游泳，便會打從心坎兒裏樂出來，更其是因爲居處的侷促，所以更覺得需要這個玩藝兒。</p>
<p>因此，每年的夏季裏，我幾乎一有空間兒，便總得趕上虹口公園去游泳。這些年來，我們公司裏，在最熱的二三個星期中，是上午辦公，下午休息的，於是我便利用這個暇晷，模仿着揚州人的「下午水包皮」，把身子浸在游泳池裏。</p>
<p>從去年起，我是時常搭着市渡輪，渡浦而上高橋的海濱浴塲去了，原因是高橋的海濱浴塲，不只地位寬暢，沙蹟柔軟，最使我留連忘返的，却是從太平洋上，吹拂過來的不激不驟，而又十分凉爽的海風。更其是炙得人皮膚上可以起泡的太陽，給都市吞下去的時候，從海水裏爬上沙灘，伸着肢體躺着，迎着晚風，那時的身心，不只感到無限的輕鬆，簡直的會忘却這是在一個氣溫在九十度以上的夏季裏呢。</p>
<p>人生雖然是那麼的不幸，但是，幸而還有游泳的所在，可以挨過那麼一個炎炎的長夏。否則，嗯，說不定，我是早已給那麼個炎炎長夏，逼得發瘋的了。</p>

<p>丘岡上，是一片茸綠的靑草，滋盈地舒展在微溫的黃泥土上；這片草地上建有一所圍着紅白條間隔的幕布的小屋；屋後是一叢翠竹，夕陽的微弱光芒，從竹葉的疎隙透射到天國的姑娘可喜的臉上，兩隻烏黑的眼，環顧四個臉壳表情不同微笑的男子。一條長松木凳，按放了一罐油爛笋，幾包美味的牛肉，五茄皮酒像開水一般的輪流灌進胃裏，一罐蜜浸的荔子，伊在緩緩地呷着甜汁。</p>
<p>這種享樂的起因，與其說是欣賞翠竹，倒不如說，借酒來麻醉苦痛吧？可是待酒醒後，又將感到如何的滋味哩！</p>
<p>酒菜完了後，幾個醉漢都動議離別這美麗的丘岡，不，丘岡是沒有美麗的，美點還是在姑娘的身上。歸途上縱談昨晚離別後懷想的情緒，我和伊並肩見行着，走過長長的河畔，小小的石橋，高高的土阜，狹狹的田塍。這姑娘身上穿着蔚藍色夾雜荳沙色花朵的長衣，米色絲襪下的綉鞋却引起—喜—的頻盼。日後回到S埠時，吿訴你們一好玩的住所。</p>
<p>這姑娘的動作，姿態，漂亮的滬語，四人的腦府中是不時浮動，最有價值丘岡上的約叙，是生命史中值得永久的牢記的一幕。</p>

<p>可是伊老人家話雖這樣說，畢竟也就舉起玉碗來一口口的把藥汁喝下去了。伊心上當然是很勉强的，巴不得棄而不喝，但是伊也不能太不講理；那四位御醫老爺既是伊自己做主去召進來的，而那第五張藥方又是伊自己作主選定的，如今那四位御醫且已鄭重其事的給伊把藥煮好，伊怎麼能不喝呢？那四位御醫一直低下了頭跪着，待到太后把藥喝完，才命令他們退去。我想這時候他們必然像釋去了千斤重負一般的高興。因爲在宮內，是誰都不願久留的，能得早些退出去，眞是求之不得的妙事。</p>
<p>太后的藥已服好，御醫們已退出，宮內的空氣居然也像鎮靜了幾分，大家都希望不要再發生什麼變故；却不料我竟出乎意外的鬧出了一件事來……。這都是我對於宮中的一切禮儀太無充分的認識的緣故。像這樣類似的事情，先前已曾發生過一次了，不過那一次凑巧是發生在我獨自和太后在一起的時候，既不曾爲旁人所注意，所以也不曾爲我自己所注意，於是就犯出這第二次來了……（三六三）！</p>

<p>六月八日美國洛杉磯克拉爾芒特大學行畢業禮，畢業的學生，都是翩翩少年，但內中雜着一位身高五尺笑容可掬的老婆婆。伊是吉士特夫人，年滿八旬，已做了曾組母，伊於六十年前已在伊里諾伊斯婦女大學（現改爲麥支茂萊大學）畢業，獲有女子文科學位，那時候的大學，都不把學士學位授給女子，但是現在已男女平等，所以這次畢業，能受着文學士學位。當伊鞠躬向校長白萊斯台爾捧領文憑的時候，伊那一雙藍眼睛速霎不休，引得人禁不住要笑。伊的八個兒女，有三個在塲觀禮，後來伊對人說道：「我不願我的兒女以我爲恥，我的兒子，已有三個得着學位，我不，喜歡聽他們說：「母親很能幹，伊會烘很好的餅乾，但是」以下是什麼；你們明白了」，「但是我還會烹調哩。」伊在克拉爾芒特大學研究一年中，著了一篇二萬八千字的論文，題目是「魯克里蒂曷士一位天然派的詩家」，這文是根據六種研究寫成的，兩種是哲學史，其餘四種，是希臘考古學，羅馬史，羅馬文學，和臘丁文。伊對人自豪，全年從未缺到一天，伊住在賽加摩亞寄宿舍一閒小室中，室中陳設簡單，和其他許多女同學相同，所不同的，伊們都掛着許多男朋友的照片，伊呢，却掛着她的兒孫和曾孫男女的照片。伊曾對同級的朋友說道：「這些靑年們讀書，只要兩三遍，便能記得，我究竟老了，必須加倍用力，才能記得。我每天用功，最少五小時，「多至八小時」。又說道：「自己所决定要做的一件事，一旦成功，自然滿意，但我求學，只不過不讓兒跑在母親的前面罷了。我想得這個學位，巳有多年「今才到手。」吉士特夫人一八五四年十一五月生於倭海倭州阿煦太布拉，一八七六年和矮沃瓦州西違瀑師範大學的英文教授吉士特教士結婚，夫婦在西違瀑住了三十五年，一九〇八和〇九年，僅留兩個兒子在家，吉博士夫人却在外從事研究文學，後來獲得康納爾（矮沃瓦州）大學保管委員會所授的文學士學位。一九三二年，吉特士逝世後，夫人曾旅行加里福尼亞州夏威夷佛洛里達州等處。伊有十一個兒女，現在還有八個生存，這位老婆婆好學不倦，也算得世上少有的了。</p>

<h3 id="c195">小說的發展過程 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>大概有創作經騐的人，一定知道在一篇作品未下筆之先，必需煞費苦心的經過一番思考：作品中人物的個性，如何描出；背景如何配備；故事如何發展……直等到那作品已經在作者心中有了充分的安排，於是才下筆寫去。那樣寫來，至少對於自己能得到某種程度的滿足。對於讀者和社會的影響如何，那當然不是作者所能計及的。這要看作者本身之社會的現實底理解與把握如何而决定的。而作者要正確地把握並理解社會的現實，那又非屬於創作範圍的事；那是屬於作者做人方面的事。茲姑不論。</p>
<p>但有時，作者雖然一切都巳安排妥當，一等到下筆寫去，竟把原來計劃，全部地或部分地給以推翻；甚至來了個相反的結果。連作者自己也預料不到，不得不隨淸筆跑野馬。這情形，我想有創作經騐的人，一定也經過過的。最好的例，便是法捷耶夫底創作經騐中的一段自白；他說：</p>
<p>『我寫毀滅時，初次遇到從前所構思的，有好多未曾納入作品中，我遇到在工作過程中出現了新的要素，那是從前所未想過的。例如：根據我原來的計劃，梅齊克結果要自殺，但在開始寫這一典型時，我漸漸地相信，他不能以自殺吿終，也不應、當如此。</p>
<p>在草就主人公的行爲，心理，外觀，表情等等大綱以後，隨着小說的發展，這個或那個主人公，便好像自己來改正原來的設計了，在典型的發展中好像出現了自身的邏輯。試舉個例子來說：梅齊克住在軍用醫院里，住在森林里，這是一回事；他好了後，加入隊伍，這又是一回事。我竭力想像，他是怎樣，在新的情勢下動作的，因此又得一個結果，作品的主人公，假使藝術家深知他的話，他本人就在某種程度上領導着自己的。</p>
<p>這一段話，眞是見血之談。不曾嘗到過創作的甘苦的人，决不能說出這麼個透澈的話。但我們畢兌不能像法捷耶夫說的那麼個虛玄，說什麼小說發展到某一階段中，小說中人物，即能領導作者，向適合他本人的音容的面貌方面走。其實這都是關涉作者本人的意識問題。即如以毀滅中的梅齊克做例來說。作者，是預計給他自殺了結的。當然梅齊克在作者的構思中，决不願給予肯定的估價，所以用自殺來否定了他行動的價值。但小說發展到某一階段時，作者正確的意識，在不時的自我檢閱中，覺得用自殺來結束梅齊克，反而在某程度上會感到這梅齊克的可愛處了。素性讓他逃亡了吧。梅齊克一逃亡，莫羅斯基的流氓性，在另一方面增高了價值；而全部毀滅中的人物，也更其有力了。這在表面上看去，好像確是作品中主人公，在領導作者。在本質上說來，還是從作者正確的意識，領導着自己的。換句話說，作者是從用自殺來否定梅齊克行動價值這一前提上，發現了自殺這一否定，沒有力量；且或引起讀者給予自殺者以同情；故更有力地用逃亡來否定梅齊克的行動價值。但作者對梅齊克給以否定的估價，這一個本質的計劃，還是沒有更變的。</p>
<p>初期的中國的新文學作者，常以「靈感」二字作爲創作者惟一的正當的態度。所以那時候的小說，大半是帶隨感錄的形式的。對於一篇作品，是不需有什麼發展過程的預先安排的。他們大都說自己文章是「搖筆而來」「一揮即就」的。無疑地這一個創作態度，現在是早給否定了。如其現在作者，尙有那麼自豪的，那倒不是顯示他創作天才的發皇，而是自白了他那自我主義的狂放而已。接着，來了一個相反的提倡，那就是所謂作品的內容問題。使那時期作品成爲乾燥無味的東西。現在自然　許多作者改正了這個不正的傾向。但也有人主張作品不一定要注意其發展過程的。這似乎也有商量的餘地。</p>
<p>把現實原形地一片段的接續寫下去，在各片段間，固當也隱約約地有其社會的有機的聯系；但這種小說在我以爲僅做到素材的陳列底第一步工夫。即如，我們讀到某作家的有些小說，使我們常常會想起肉枕上一塊塊血淋的肉來。在其表出上，自然也有部分的逼眞處。然而决不是生動的。這在作者，固然是經過了一種主觀的選擇的；但沒有意識地給予有機的連繋。換句話，作者這一種手法，是忽略了每一現象的因果的追求。</p>
<p>每一篇小說，不一定要有完整的故事。每每一篇作品，非注重它發展的過程不可。而且這發展過程，决不能一片段一片段地漫無連系。必需在其發展過程中，注意其因果性，給予以肯定或否定的估價。</p>
<h3 id="c196">中國產日月的女神 <a href="#c196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— 姚雪垠</p>
<p>希臘和北歐，都有很美麗的神話。中國也經過草昧時代，大概原先也不例外，不過后來大部分的神話可惜都失傳了。</p>
<p>羿射十日，是倖存的美麗的神話之一，但也不很完整。從前我曾從「天問」，「離騷」，山海經，「淮南子』及『左傳』等書中去搜集關於這故事的一切村料，作一種比較的研究，結果於無意中又發現了產生白月的女神。而有趣的是：產生日月的女神原是一雙姊妹花，為婦孺皆知的娥皇和女英。</p>
<p>在遠古，據郭沫若「甲骨文字研究」，推定在已略知耕稼的夏殷民族中，產生了十日的神話。本來野蠻人看見日頭一升一落，以爲日落是日的休息，第二天從東邊出來的是第二個，這猜測是很合乎情理的。他們猜測着太陽有兄弟十個，一替一天的輪司着白畫；后來十個兄弟一齊出來，晒死了禾稼，草木，人和畜生，於是上帝就『賜羿彤弓素繪」，把太陽射殺九個。這上帝，在夏民族是帝堯，在殷民族就是帝舜。古書中載天上有多個太陽的地方如、</p>
<p>湯谷（即暘谷）上有扶木，一日方至，一日方出，皆載於烏。（大荒東經）</p>
<p>湯谷上有扶桑，十日所出。在黑齒北，居水中，有大木，九日居下枝，一日居上枝。（海外東經）　若木在建木西，末有十日，其華照下地。（淮南子地形訓）</p>
<p>武王伐紂……當戰之時，十日亂於上。（同上兵略訓）</p>
<p>「帝蓮」八年，有妖孽，十日並出。（竹書紀年）　十日代出，流金爍石些。（招鬼）</p>
<p>此外如桀二十九年二日並出，見「竹書紀年」和「孝經緯」；晋愍帝建興五年，三日並照；唐書「土厥傳」：五日並出，三月連明。不過天有十日是最古的，最爲一般週知的神話罷了。</p>
<p>關於十日的產生，「大荒南經」裏說。。</p>
<p>東海之外，甘水之間，有羲和之國；有女于名日義和，方浴日於甘淵。羲和者，帝俊之妻，生十日。</p>
<p>據近人的考證：帝俊即帝響，也就是帝舜。舜妻相傳爲娥皇和女英。「義」古意讀「娥」，「皇」興「和」又同聲，義和應該就是娥皇，所以「大荒南經」裏又有「帝俊妻娥皇，生此三身之國』的話。因此，我說產十日的女神是娥皇，想是不會有什麼錯誤的。至於認女英爲產月之神，其證據如下：</p>
<p>帝俊妻常羲，生十有二月。（大荒西經）</p>
<p>帝嚳次妃娶訾氏女曰常儀。（帝王世紀）</p>
<p>常羲同常儀，就是常娥。譽即舜，舜之次妃爲女英，所以女英就是常儀，后來又寫做「嫦娥」或「姮娥」。「海內北經」云：『舜妻登比氏生宵明燭光，處河大澤。二女之靈能照此所方百里。』便是二妃生日月的痕迹。大概女英這個名字是後來才有的。原先的傳說，舜的二妃不是娥皇女英，而是羲和同常儀。到後來神話歷史化了，義和同娥皇便給劈做兩人，前者變成日御；又給劈做羲氏和氏，爲堯之二臣。無端跑出來個女英，把嫦娥從舜的身邊擠出來，變做了竊芹奔月之羿妻。嫦娥奔月的故事，和秦漢間的方士有關係，是非常明　的。</p>
<h3 id="c197">萊佛士廣塲 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 斐兒</p>
<p>新加坡印象記之三</p>
<p>每天，萊佛士廣塲整齊地排列了許多新式的汽車，兩旁的高樓大厦搆成了全南洋的心臟。洋錢從這裏不住地流入和溢出，整個的南洋殖民地緊捉在高級的職員們的筆下。</p>
<p>早晨和黃昏，汽車和電車載滿人來也載滿人去。賣報人高叫着嗓子，洋文報紙被棄在辦公桌上，或被挾在脅下。</p>
<p>中午，銀行和洋行一放工，印度人的老板便挺起大肚子在他的咖啡店裏指揮着黑色夥友招呼客人。於是咖啡店裏立刻陳列了許多人種：白的，黃的，黑的和椶色的。同時咖啡店裏也騰起了熱食，冷飲和香烟的烟霧。馬來語和馬來式的英語，偶然地也間雜着一點印度話和中國話，更被滔滔地從口裏流瀉出來，把全間咖啡店攪成一片噪聲。</p>
<p>揀着咖啡店的冷靜的僻角，靜靜地去觀察這包羅世界的各種人的臉孔，（抱憾的是只缺乏了紅色人種）看這些搆成南羊的「墻街」的每個角色，怎樣用一種姿態去表顯出自已是資本主義的一件零碎的機件來，是怪有味兒的。</p>
<p>一直到黑夜，萊佛士廣塲便只剩下一片冷靜和荒凉了。銀行和洋行緊閉上了鐵門，英美通俗刋物的書店只在橱窗間展露着各種趣味書藉的封面；供給洋行職員們的日用必需品的中國小學徙已停止了喊賣貨物的嗄聲，而成疊的貨單也被收起。印度守門人在臥塌上打着鼾聲，而「馬打」們（馬來警察）寂寞地踏着疲倦的足步，月亮兒從四壁的高高的屋角上　下冷淡的銀光，萊佛士廣塲像被士敏土所包圍着的荒凉的城堡。冷靜時萊佛士廣塲會闃無行人，只有隣近着的海濱的海潮在深夜時激起了波濤的吼喘。</p>
<p>日間的噪鬧和夜間的冷寂，是新加坡底心臟的正規的伸縮，待洋行的職員們也咀咒起他們的「倫敦祖家」，在不景的狂潮也捲進萊佛士廣塲而使他們失業或减薪的時候，萊佛士廣塲又犯着貧血症了。於是萊佛士廣塲會漸漸地褪下牠的强烈的色澤，而令人對牠的特有的印象漸漸减退下來。</p>
<h3 id="c198">大學時代（二二） <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>我正在迷惘時候，忽然聽見小姑娘一聲低微的夜安！接着我就看見她消失在　子底陰影裏。我遼聽見屋門小心開動的聲音和門鈴底輕微　聲，然後我回轉身來，慢慢地穿過宮邸花園走回家去。</p>
<p>我沒有到雙親底住房吃晚飯，便潛身上樓走到我的房間裏去。我像酒醉一般躺在墊褥上面。過了一刻鐘後，我聽見房門響動；從半閉的眼縫裏，我看見母親，拿一盞燈走近我的床邊。她屈身向我，但我把眼睛閉緊，繼續夢想下去。今晚別離時，她雖然沒有給我很多的希望，但我覺得好像我的手已經抓住一條玫瑰花紥的綵　，向郝未來的生活走去了。</p>
<p>我那天晚上極願一個人默想着，第二天平晨又極願跑到人羣中間去。我有一種自由和勝利底新感覺，現在我極願在別人面前來感知這個感覺。我一經吃完早飯幷把母親幾個麻煩問題勉强回答之後，便走到我的朋友克里斯多夫底作坊去。他正全神貫注地選擇小塊桃花心木版，傘來雕刻。「你在做甚麼好看的東西？」我問。</p>
<p>「一個針線盒子，」他說，沒有抬頭起來。</p>
<p>「一個針線盒子？做給誰的？」</p>
<p>「給雷娜澀。波力嘉的；我的妹妹要送給她作爲生口底禮物。」</p>
<p>我從旁邊觀看他；一種得意的微笑現出在我臉上。「麗眞是你的寳貝麼，克里斯多夫？」</p>
<p>這個好靑年，給我這冒味的問題弄得滿臉通紅。他似乎對自己這種狼狽狀况也氣憤了。「你們還是把她從你門那個拉丁人跳舞學校裏放出來吧！」他說，一面用他的刀氣憤憤地劈那木板。</p>
<p>「你果眞這樣吃醋麼，克里斯多夫？」我問。</p>
<p>但他沒有回答；他祇喃喃自語說。「如果是我的妹妹的話，那就……」</p>
<p>可是這次事情祗是我的獨一無二的一次得意事情而已，因爲以後無論我如何想方設法，我終究沒有機會單獨同娜麗在一處。在這年夏季中她還有幾次星期日下午在花園後面人行道上遇見我，但克里斯多夫和他的妹妹陪伴着她，這個好靑年在她旁邊　傲地走着，彷彿要爲她同一「拉丁人」打架似的；她自己，當我走去同他們談話時候，也彷彿聳動他們向前走去不要和我接談。</p>

<p>— 齊吾文</p>
<p>在這短短的期間，我跑了好些小地方，而且渡過黃河兩次。那簡直不是行旅，而只是奔馳，流轉。比我飄忽的，只有在西風中的白雲吧！</p>
<p>不錯，人生永遠是在途中，我更是在途中的途中。</p>
<p>在一個夜裏，我趁平漢車南下，到了黃河北岸，我便跑出車箱外上落的地方，靠着鐵欄桿，等待親炙黃河的夜景。</p>
<p>一聲悠長而尖銳的汽笛在風中曳過，龐大的黃河鐵橋在眼前了；跟着輪軌和擦的沈重的金屬聲昔多了一點空虛她緩的意味。首先看到的是一片廣大的淺黃而帶灰色的沙灘，過了三十多節的橋了，橋下還只是沙。在灰色的天空中看不到月亮，稀疏的星辰給細沙織成的幕障着，西北風吹過，若隱若現的閃瞬，在這樣的天空下，沙灘像柔軟的死海那樣靜默地展開，鐵橋的燈懸照着沈重而整齊的鐵橋的影，沈重的一行列的火車的影，倒壓在這海裏。</p>
<p>終於看見河的本身了，水像是不深，在燈光下還可辨出牠那濁黃的顏色！比沙灘還黃一點的顏色。風似乎比前緊了一點，機輪的嗓音掩不住河水濺岸的有節拍的聲嚮。越到河的中心，水流越急，白色的　渦在洶湧着。河是空的，只在河與星空快要相接的遠處，點着一團參差的黑影，從那修長的揷天的桿形物，我認出牠是一隻船了。在這樣的黑夜，在這樣的古典的河裏，孤零零地停着這樣的古式的船，「是一個幽異的夢吧？」我不　給這幅富於憂　性的暗示的畫圖導入幻想裏了。我記起我恍惚曾做過好些回跟這個畫圖相似的夢，有時我覺得牠是「命運」的黑影，有時我覺得牠是「絕望」的象徵，醒後，常起一種難名的恐怖。而今竟置身這種相似的現實境界了，——而且恰是在前頭橫着渺茫的前途的風庫裏，我當時下意識是如何的悸動呀！</p>
<p>黃河不一會就渡過，跟着的又是一片廣闊的沙灘，待到鐵橋過盡了之後我才回轉車廂去。我覺得有點凉意，摩摩自己的雙頰，也一片冰凉，原來我站在風中差不多有半個鐘頭了。</p>
<p>「明知此　定重過，其奈尊前百感何？亦是此生未曾有，滿襟淸淚渡黃河！」這不是　定庵癸亥（？）雜詩之一嗎？我第一次讀龔定庵詩，是由於朋友的極力推薦。那朋友曾經問我最愛讀那些，我記得這一言詩是我當時特別喜歡的。我愛牠的白描，我受牠曲折，但是我總覺得牠的傷感有點誇大。想不到我現在竟親臨詩中的境界了，而且傷感也似乎同樣的誇大。這　偶然的巧合，是值得我的回味的。</p>

<p>— 夢若</p>
<p>在現在一班自稱所謂文明人的中間，往往尙遺留着不少野蠻的習俗。譬如决鬥卽是一例，决鬥常起於男女間戀愛的糾紛或者某種事件的爭執。决鬥的方式，有的是比劍，有的是鬥槍，决鬥的時候，除决鬥者二人以外，還要請、一位公正人，到塲作證，這種行爲，在我們看起來，是野蠻的，但他們却說是文明，因爲决鬥是雙方願意的，且有應遵守的决鬥規則，實在的，這比之暗殺，也許文明一點。</p>
<p>近日由倫敦傳來的消息，有一位法西斯派意報記者意人法萊列大尉，聲稱願與英下院工黨副領袖阿特里少佐决鬥，法氏謂他願在中立國用任何武器與阿氏一决雌雄，蓋他反對阿氏近頃於英下院辯論意阿爭案時，曾作某種保留，故有這决心。聞阿氏已予拒絕，謂决鬥乃解决爭議之野蠻的惡習，他不屑出此，但法氏仍不滿意，决欲爲之云。</p>
<p>英意的情感，本不惡劣，但近今因爲意阿問題的爭執，兩國間遂發生裂痕，最初雙方執政領袖，各發出針鋒相對的言論，互相指責，後來輿論界亦繼起，彼此以嚴厲的言詞？互相攻擊。不意現在又有意報記者，宣稱欲與英少佐决鬥，這亦是英意交惡的一端。</p>
<p>平心而論，法萊列之欲與阿特里决鬥，其動機實出於愛國思想所激成，而不是由於私人的仇怨。然這種行爲，未免過於偏激。阿氏予以拒絕，並非示弱，他的確是不屑出此。聞阿氏接見路透訪員，談及這事時，謂意國今日全無言論自由，致法氏不知英議院辯論時之所可許者。不知法氏對於這話作何威想？</p>
<h3 id="c202">簫聲 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>夏夜的月色有如潔白的乳水，有如一個溫靜的處女似地瀉進我孤獨者的窗前；每天被煩重的工作磨折着自己瘦弱的身體，在月明之夜，我就貪戀着她底溫柔幽靜，閉熄了電、炬，在窗前抽着淡味的烟捲。夏夜的輕風如母愛一般地拂過我的面前，呆望着嫋嫋的輕烟向上飄散，自己像靜化在這溶合的寗穆的環境中一樣，一點沒有思慮，往往遺忘了睡眠的時問。</p>
<p>一星期來，每夜的輕風中播送着幽怨的簫聲。自己雖然不懂音樂，可是喜歡音樂，但是那如泣如訴的簫聲撩起了我無限的哀愁！</p>
<p>我每夜傾聽着，想辨別牠的方向。近郊是那樣地淸靜，住戶都是很早安睡的，除了閣閣的蚌聲，就是那個不相識者的簫聲了；但是卽使我傾耳靜聽，總不能辨出牠是在我的那方面。幾天來的心境就被牠擾得沒有安寗的時候，我每天遲眠，幾乎專聽他的簫聲而那樣做的。</p>
<p>——那個不相識者有不可吿人的隱憂嗎？或許他是撩起了濃厚的鄉愁？在月白風淸之夜，就將一腔憂怨，憑洞簫而一吐。但是他曾否顧慮到有我這樣一個人（說不定還有更多的同情者）被他的簫聲勾引出悽痛底回憶？也曾這樣想過，他楚個豪放的詩人，他見如此良月夜，正在搜索枯腸做一首詩。在沒有覓到得意的作品的時候，借吹簫來助長他的詩興，然而爲什麼不吹一個快樂之曲呢？做人是應該樂觀的！</p>
<p>但是今夜，我惦念着他的時候，沒有如我意料中的簫聲送來。我又敏感地想到或許他痴了；或是又流浪到另一個陌生地方去，但是不要如我的理想；我寗願明夜再聽見他的低怨的簫聲！</p>
<p>於是一張白晳臉，掠過我的面前，他是中學時代的同學，由吹簫而認識的。</p>
<p>——一個節假日底晚上，我很早睡了。但被一種莫名其妙的襲擊圍繞着我，使我不能卽刻睡去。那個時候我第一次聽見了簫聲。是鄰舍的一個同學，他弄着他的一支鳳凰簫，那種低怨的聲音我再不能安睡了，就大聲地槌着墻壁，意思是警吿他可以停止那個牢什子的東西。</p>
<p>但是出於意外地他喊了起來：「朋友，到我這邊來坐坐吧。」</p>
<p>彷彿是捧到了長官的命令，我的怒氣全消，披上浴衣，不由自主地去打他的房門。開門出來的是那個我每天謀面却沒有招呼過一次的一位年靑同學。從同學們談起，他是那樣孤僻，卽是同宿舍的也很難見到他一次笑臉。他永遠孤獨地。今天我却在他底瘦削的臉找到一絲溫暖底笑意，他熱情地握着我的手，但是他底手是冰冷的。</p>
<p>——很抱歉，我們沒有談過一次話。放假日爲什麼不回家去？</p>
<p>——回到什麼地方去？</p>
<p>——沒有家？倒是一樣地可憐！</p>
<p>由於同情心底激發，我們一見如故。變成了很知己的朋友。最後幾年我們都是同住在一個宿舍里，雖然我的朋友們勸吿我說我不能接近那樣怪僻的人，對於我是很危險的。</p>
<p>但是我們平安地畢業了。在離別底晚上，我們是那樣珍重地握手而別。日子是那般飛快，如今已是長長的五年了，可是我沒有聽到他的行蹤及接過他的片言隻字。</p>
<p>今夜的簫聲爲什麼突然停歇了呢？他或許是我那個孤獨底朋友。卽是一個我所永不相識者，我亦祝福他不要如我所想像地不幸！</p>

<p>— 梁啟筠</p>
<p>我喜歡夢。</p>
<p>凡是給現實的餓鐐禁錮住的人們，我相信是沒有那一個會說不喜歡夢的。</p>
<p>夢能給人以安慰；雖然，這安慰是暫時的，不消一會兒，牠就曇花一現般的幻滅了。但倘使你夢到了你旦夕所追求而不獲的東西，那你該會感覺到怎樣的愉快呢！至少，你也能在極其憂鬱的氛圍中展開一絲笑臉吧。雖則，過後或者是由於太過分的欣喜而感到些微的失望，你要說：</p>
<p>——呵，只可惜那是夢呢！</p>
<p>夢之美，是美極了，那麼地平靜而輕快的。好像在春天，那個愈快的溫馨的季節里，盛開的艶麗的桃花的落瓣掉在靜穆的溪水上，輕微地泛起的漣漪似的，春風溫和地撫慰着牠，悠悠的向四面蕩漾開去。而後，又漸，兒的在不知什麼時候和什麼地方消失去了。</p>
<p>記不淸在那一本譯作的譯者的序上說，露西亞人是最善於做夢的。於是，我把那本書讀之又讀，不知是不是受了牠的影響呢？我現在總愛做夢。</p>
<p>夢是近乎幻想的。因爲自家時常憧憬着高加索，西班牙，或是夏威夷這些地方的可愛。所以，看了小說或電影說到這些地，便會發生下面的一些憧憬——。</p>
<p>「一個南方熱帶的海島，明月掛在淡墨色的天空，草地上交織着椰子樹的巨大的優美的黑影，獨個兒躺倒在一顆　　樹下，靜聽土人奏若含有原始風味的激辣的挑撥音樂，……」</p>
<p>「或是在一個古色古香的堡城中，聽着西班牙風的曲子，男人們，鬥牛的健美的勇士，女人家，穿着別有一番風味的衣裙，美麗的而又憂鬱的臉上掛着一絲淺淺的笑意，……」</p>
<p>那一夜，說不定，關於這些東西的夢，會悄悄地來臨的。</p>

<h3 id="c204">看雨 <a href="#c204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— 林熙</p>
<p>就我生平看過的雨來說吧，看得最有趣的是在這三種景况下的：在輸船上，在火車上，再就是小時在家的門口了。小時的景物好像是總値得留戀的，但有許多現在想起來也沒有什麼大意思，這也許是心情變了的緣故；在家的門口看雨的那股心情，現在好像是沒有了，也許是家境太壞，不容一個大人再在門口裝小孩了，於是這一種的看雨，現在只能在回憶裏嘗着一點風味：實在却是沒有什麽大興趣了的。</p>
<p>至於在輪船上和火車上看雨，可就是大人的事了。風塵勞碌中能看到一陣雨，這在一個旅人，實在是可以有一陣溫潤之感的。在許多地方卽便是會引起旅人的寂寞威，而這寂寞也是甜的，潤的：在我就是這樣。「淸明時節雨紛紛」的那個味兒，我沒嘗過，不知道。不過從時上看，那些路上行人就眞是在詩中：順着牧童的手，遙遙地看着雨裏的杏花　，那迷濛的情景，說是斷魂，倒不　說是醉了；雖是醉得寂寞吧，但也是甜的，　的。這要是在船上或車上，那　可以寂寞得入了睡鄉，總比聽着乾燥的　　撞擊聲而　悶好得多。甜潤得多。　悶的時候，一簿　就是一劑催眠　，　　　可以　得是　，可以把煩悶冲走。看雨看着便入了睡鄉是一件極可讚美的事。小時坐在家的門口，搖着腿，〇起無名的歌，看風送着雨絲飄過椰葉，飄過迷濛的田，看着看着往牆上一靠便睡着了就是常有的事；現在雖沒有那個機會，也沒有那個心情了，但想起來也總還是甜潤的。這種看雨，現在只剩下回憶了！實際嘗到看雨的美味的，就在輪船和火車上了。</p>
<p>輪船上看雨，總感到些孤舟雨打篷的味兒，所以只說看，像是不够的；還得聽。看固好，海的迷濛，眞會使一個看得出神的人跳了下去的；而聽更有風趣。那是有拍節的，輪行時的機械聲，就是拍節，很平勻，乘過船的人大槪都曉得。每一個拍節裏，都有風和水的聲浪，那是一個很偉大的進行曲，有着所謂扷山倒海的聲勢；是的，旅客們在這種聲勢裏是會寂寞起來的，然而那種少見的聲勢，會使旅客們忘了自己，忘了枯燥和煩悶；會在寂寞中「忘形」了的。情景之「美」者是可以把人拉到情景裏頭去的，這也許就是所謂「羽化」了。看雨是會使人看到這樣的地步的。</p>
<p>雨一定是很能吸住人的。三等車上，該是最囂張的了。我說囂張，還是指着旅人們的心裏，看着電杆一支支地後退，誰個不計算着離自己的家還有多遠呢？本來，出門眞是苦事，帶着焦念而煩悶的心，一看四周却沒有一個面識的人，自己的話，只有〇在自己的心裏；疲倦的面容表示着疲倦的心事，面對面，只是裝着看車外的景物，誰也猜不透對面的人懷着怎樣的心情，這够多囂張，多好煩！可是一看四下低垂，陰沉沉的，這種苦煉的氛圍就會自然地解了的；一看窗外的莊稼搖動起來，那山雨欲來的情景，幾乎迫得每個客人都會說聲雨來了，「是，雨來了！」對面的也會回答着，這就攀談起來，第三個也會加上一句：「關上窗戶吧！」這一來，陌生人也就不陌生了。這是雨的功效，使旅人的心溫潤起來。談着，談興低了的時候，就回過頭去看雨，看雨打着窗外的莊稼，看遠看樹，着天邊。，走過村莊，村莊的居民，也正携幼抱小小在門口看雨啦！看着看着心裏便會朦朧起來，離家多遠，也就無暇去計算了！彼此一靠，有的遂讓雨吸了去！剩下的就是拍節，輪軌相磨的聲音。</p>
<p>看雨就這樣有趣。但說來也許是我的悲哀，小時的那種看雨，過去了。只能在回憶裏嘗到一點風味，風味雖好，無奈人是大了，而且也沒有那種心情去多回憶了。</p>

<p>人們都管陳燕燕叫做「美麗的小鳥」，因爲她近來主演「寒江落雁」，穿了件富有西洋古典味的華裳，人們又都管她叫做「美麗的小婦人」。</p>
<p>凱絲琳海濱主演的「小婦人」，她的裝束差不多和她是一樣的。燕燕這樣裝束起來，眞是越發顯得美麗　靜。正因爲如比，所以她穿這服裝所拍的照像，最近上海的幾種電影刋物幾乎都用它做過封面。</p>
<p>據導演馬徐維邦說：「寒江落雁」所以讓燕燕穿上這種衣裳的原因，並不是標新立異，却實是爲着演出方面着想。至於這件衣裳，又有怎樣的一種演出效果，那我們只有等待看這部影片。</p>

<p>「時勢英雄」拍尙冠武五十壽辰的那一夜，因塲面太大，演員過多，預定拍的十八個鏡頭，只拍了一半，昨夜又全體總動員，拍未完的九個鏡頭。</p>
<p>這夜裏熱鬧狀况，一如昨夕，不過五百位賀客中，又過了四位，一位是裝束入時的摩登夫人，三位是活潑天眞的孩子，這四位賀客客串表演，極引起全撮影塲的人注目，原來這一位「摩登夫人」和三個孩子，就是導演應雲衛的夫人公子，這夜他們全家都在「時勢英雄」裏客串演戲，表情均稱自然，攝影師周克有評語曰：「名導演夫人公子的是不凡」。</p>

<p>趙丹這個有着漂亮臉子的小生，他的一舉一動，給誰看見，都會對他發生了好感，他的演技不單在銀幕上有着很大的成功，即使在舞台上，也有着優越的成績。上次業餘劇社公演「娜拉」，趙丹在其中飾赫爾茂一角，表情的確出神入化，而被某導演稱爲有着「鬼」才的演員。</p>
<p>爲了愛好戲劇的關係，趙丹前天在明星攝影塲內召集了他的愛好戲劇的同志，預備組織一個戲劇團體，並發表他對於戲劇的意見，大意是說戲劇是改造社會的唯一工具，所以我們要有志改迭社會，首先要從戲劇入手……他的同志都熱烈地拍手讚成，舒　文更歡喜得不亦樂乎，狂熱地和他擁抱了起來，那知正預備接吻的時候，導演張石川大喊着「卡脫」，禁止他倆的行動，可算大煞風景，於是這幕好事就此作罷，後來沒有到熱鬧的向觀者一打聽，才知道他們是在攝製「大家庭」中的一幕。</p>

<h3 id="e1">The Yellow River in Shandong Province Overflows; Two Breaches Occur at Linpu Collection Point; Torrential Waters Diverge Towards Heze and Yuncheng; Water from the Yu River Overflows the Hua-Yang Dike; Feng and Hua Counties Both Become Disaster Areas <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan) On the 10th at noon, the Yellow River in Shaanxi Prefecture saw a sudden rise of 2.5 meters. At Shenshi (3-5 pm), in Zhengcheng territory of the southern bank of the upper reaches of the Yellow River in our province, Li Sheng Village, due to the excessively strong flow, a breach occurred in the Seventh Dam's encircling dike. While efforts were being made to plug the breach, several breaches appeared in the people's embankment below the Tenth Dam. Soon, the people's embankment overflowed, and the water at the foot of the main dike was more than three feet deep. Although the dikes had been newly raised by five or six feet this year, the water rose too rapidly, leveling with the top everywhere. At Youshi (5-7 pm), the water finally exceeded the top of the dike and overflowed between Cangzhuang and Linpu Collection Point, dividing into two streams, one heading south towards Heze and the other northeast towards Yuncheng. After receiving the telegram, the Provincial Government urgently telegraphed all counties along the river to spare no effort in protection and sent Lian Zhuang Association Chairman Han Duo-feng, along with River Bureau Chief Zhang Lian-jia, to rush to Linpu Collection Point for inspection today. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) On the evening of the 10th, two breaches occurred in the Yellow River at Linpu Collection Point, one between Linpu and Zhao Village, about forty zhang wide, and the other at the dike of Li Sheng Village, about forty or fifty zhang wide. This afternoon, the head of the water had already reached Zhengying in Juancheng territory, thirty-five li from the breach. One stream had already reached Yuncheng territory. The Huang'an Jiangshun and Zhao Wangmo two (units of measurement unclear in original) flowed south into Nanyang Lake. Now, Heze and Juye counties have started construction on an east-west dike to run parallel with the breach water, preventing it from flowing south. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) At the time of the breach on the evening of the 10th, the water level at Li Sheng Village was 58.9 meters, exceeding the highest water level of last year by 0.4 meters. The water has receded slightly tonight, but Luokou is still rising, with the water level reaching 30.35 meters. There are also three breaches, each ranging from twenty to thirty zhang wide. The entire area inside and outside the dike is flooded, with no place to obtain soil for plugging the breaches. Materials for plugging the breaches have been borrowed from Dongming, and laborers have been mobilized for plugging. If the Jiangsu dam does not collapse, diverting the main flow, and continues northwest, the breaches may be easier to plug. Also, the people's embankment in Fan County on the north bank overflowed. In addition, the head of the water from the Linji Collection Point breach is one zhang high, traveling three or four li per hour. The Juancheng County Magistrate has already securely blocked the second and third people's embankments, preventing the flood damage from expanding. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The upper, middle, and lower reaches of the Yellow River in the province are still experiencing rising water levels. The water level at Luokou is 30.27 meters. However, a telegram from the Yellow River Committee stated that the upper reaches have dropped significantly. The flow at Zhongmu was 4300 cubic meters on the 10th but has fallen to 2100 cubic meters on the 11th. Zheng Yao-xi and others have been dispatched to inspect the work. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Jinan) The water level at Luokou in the north of the city has risen 2.32 meters from last night to this morning, reaching 30.006 meters. Three days before the annual high-water season, it has already exceeded the highest water level of last year by 0.4 meters. The magnitude of the water is unprecedented. The River Bureau is working around the clock on flood control, and committee members are departing ahead of schedule. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) Due to unfinished repairs, the Hua-Yang Dike overflowed in several places on the morning of the 11th, causing disaster again in Feng and Hua counties. Li Yi-she, Kong Xiang-rong, and Zhang Han-ying inspected the overflowing areas passing through Lanfeng Guying. They rushed to the danger area at Linpu Collection Point in Lu province on the afternoon of the 11th. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) The water level in Zhongmu, Yu province, and other areas has dropped by 1 to 1.3 meters on the 11th. The River Bureau is rushing to repair and restore the collapsed barrages, but materials are lacking. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) Heavy rains have fallen for days in Henan and Shaanxi, making the Yellow River affairs critical. Each dam in Wenxian, Wuzhi and Zhongmu, Henan Province, were all disturbed, luckily without danger. Currently the flood control project in Lanfeng is most urgent. Fang Juehui, Inspector of the Henan-Shandong District, accompanied by Wang Yunpu, Chief of the Investigation Section of the Inspector's Office, and Tao Shuzeng, Chief of the Inspection Department of the River Bureau, personally inspected the Lanfeng flood control project at 7 a.m. on the 11th (11th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) Inspector Fang Juehui inspected the dikes along the river on the morning of the 11th and returned to Bian in the afternoon, planning to go again on the 12th. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Kong Xiangrong telegraphed that he would go to Linpu Collection Point from Bian for inspection. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Zhou Lisheng planned to go to Baoding on the 12th and then to southern Hebei to inspect the river dikes. On the 11th, he also telegraphed Shang Zhen and Lu Xian, Director of the Construction Department, asking them to order their subordinates to step up prevention measures to avoid disasters. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Although the rivers in Hebei province showed no signs of disaster, Zhou Lisheng telegraphed Shang Zhen and Lu Xian, the Director of the Construction Department, on the 11th, saying that since the upper reaches of the Yellow River were rising sharply, precautions must be taken in advance. Please strictly order the counties along the river and the river affairs personnel to strengthen the prevention of dikes. If there is any danger, they must do their best to plug it to avoid disasters. He also said that he would go to Baoding, Puyang, and Changyuan for inspection immediately, and at the same time, he telegraphed Yu Youren to report on the Yellow River situation in Hebei Province. (11th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Qin Fen, secretary of the Economic Committee, was reported that flood control on the Yellow River had been tight for days. On the 11th, he took the Gonghe wheel from Hankou eastward and could arrive in Beijing on the 13th. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Li Yi-she, chairman of the Yellow River Conservancy Association, will come to Beijing to report on the water situation and negotiate disaster relief funds due to the rising water level of the Yellow River within days. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e2">Yanshi Still Under Water; County Seat to Be Moved to Higher Ground <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>(Kaifeng) The Luo River overflowed on the morning of the 9th, and the entire county seat of Yanshi was submerged. Disaster victims stood around the city calling for help, a tragic scene heard for several miles. Many were drowned or crushed to death, with corpses floating everywhere. The new and old cities of Gong County in districts 1, 5, 6, and 7 were also completely submerged, with water depths of eight or nine feet on flat ground, and houses, livestock, and belongings all swept away by the flood. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Luoyang) There was heavy rain in Luoyang on the 6th, 7th, and 8th. The ditches were full, and the Yi and Luo rivers rose sharply, submerging the entire city of Yanshi, with countless deaths and injuries. Boats traveled in the streets of Gong County, and telegrams and telephones were cut off. The disaster situation was severe. (10th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to road news, the water level between Xiaoyi Heishi Pass and Yijingpu on the Longhai Railway has fallen by two-thirds. Due to the solid roadbed, there was no damage, and trains are running as usual. However, the county seat of Yanshi is still under water, the northeast gate of the city has collapsed, and the city walls and houses washed away by the water are a shocking sight. Floating corpses are everywhere, and firewood is floating. Refugees who escaped are either on the roadside or living on the high ground. It is reported that the Henan Provincial Government, in addition to urgently planning relief for Yanshi, will consider moving the county seat to a plateau. Since the Longhai and Pinghan Railways were blocked by water, the Jinpu Railway has now notified all stations to temporarily suspend the sale of joint transportation tickets. The Longhai westbound express and slow trains still run to Tongguan. (11th Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Water on the Western Section of the Longhai Railway Recedes; Slow Trains Reach Weinan <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) According to road news, the water on the western section of the Longhai Railway has receded, the weather has cleared, and the roadbed west of Tongguan is gradually solid. Slow trains reach Weinan, while express trains still stop at Tongguan. The Baqiao bridge is under repair, and traffic to Xi'an is expected to resume within a week. However, there is still a lot of water in the city of Yanshi. (11th Special Dispatch) The breach in the Baqiao bridge on the Longhai Railway is being rushed to repair. The eastbound train arrived at the east bank of Baqiao on the 8th, and mail was transported to Xi'an by manpower. (10th Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e4">Flooding of Various Rivers in Shaanxi Province <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>(Xi'an) After heavy rains in Shaanxi Province, all rivers overflowed, and mountain torrents erupted, washing away villages and fields along the riverbanks. The counties of Chang'an and Lantian suffered the most losses. Fortunately, it is clear now. (10th Central News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e5">Hunan Province; Dike Collapse in Various Lakeside Counties <a href="#e5" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c5" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">5</a></h3>
<p>(Changsha) In the lakeside counties of Changde, Li, Hannan, and Yuan, more than 500 dikes and embankments have collapsed in recent days. The disaster situation is more serious than in 1931. The water in the city of Changde is more than ten feet deep. In addition to allocating 2,000 yuan to set up porridge kitchens, the central government is requested to send personnel to provide disaster relief. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e6">The Xiang River Rises Sharply, and the Water Level in Hankou Continues to Rise; The Military Headquarters Pays Attention to Epidemic Prevention Among Disaster Victims; An Emergency Flood Control Meeting Is Held; A Decision Is Made to Raise the Dikes Along the River; Zhang Qun Arrives in Hankou to Inspect the Fenzhou Area <a href="#e6" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c6" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">6</a></h3>
<p>(Hankou) The Xiang River is rising sharply. The water level in Hankou rose by 1.2 feet in one hour on the evening of the 11th. Qiaokou and the Wusheng Temple were flooded. The Zhanggong Dike, Fenzhou, and Danshui Pond are in critical condition, and the Municipal Public Security Bureau is responsible for supervising the emergency rescue. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) According to a telegram from Fancheng on the 9th, the city was flooded on the 6th due to the sharp rise in the Xiang River by more than ten feet. One-third of the houses in the city were submerged, and the people died, similar to a land sink. The losses were very large. Details are under investigation, and local authorities are taking measures to rescue. (11th Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Hankou) The Xiang River water rose sharply on the 11th, and the head of the water arrived in Hankou on the 11th. The water situation in the Huangjintang area is worrying. Fortunately, the water rises too fast, and the subsidence is easy. If there is no danger on the night of the 11th, it can enter a safe situation at noon on the 12th. The river bank of Special Zone 1 of Hankou is relatively low. The river water has risen by three inches, and the pressure has increased. There are many leaks in the ground in the low-lying areas. Rescue work is underway. Hanyang collapsed due to the day's collapse, and Parrot Island was the first to fall, followed by the Jiang'an. Now the water situation is getting worse, and it is almost impossible to save. Judging from the current situation, it has become a major disaster in the past 20 years. There are leaks in the Wutai and Wannian gates of Wuchang. After the rescue, the situation is still good. However, the Wuhui Dike has not been out of danger due to its unstable construction.

The Han River water continued to rise by seven inches on the 11th, only three feet and three inches away from the highest water level in 1931. The situation was tense again. The water on the first wharf of Hankou was onshore, and more than 20 dangers occurred in the Wuhui Dike of Wuchang, which may continue to collapse. The entire city of Laohukou in the upper reaches was submerged, with a depth of more than ten feet, and 60-70% of the houses collapsed. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Although the water situation is stable, the dikes are still dangerous. The Jiangdi of Xujiapeng in Wuchang, Yangsi Shiguan, Wutai Dam, Wuqing Dam, Sanyidian, Wangjiaxiang, and Wufeng Dam are all leaking. The foot of the Laodaokou Dike is collapsing.

<p>(Hankou) The number of people who died in the Yangtze River flood is currently impossible to count, but according to unofficial reports from Yichang, at least 400 people have drowned. According to a survey by the Public Security Bureau, 4,410 houses in Wuchang and Hanyang were destroyed, leaving more than 20,000 people homeless. The authorities have now ordered the victims to be concentrated in Meijiashan (transliteration) and Fenghuangshan. The Hubei Provincial Government and the Pacification Office held an emergency meeting yesterday to discuss ways to relieve the victims. According to the Chu Report, the Shashi levee did not collapse, but all places outside the levee have been flooded. The water level in Hankou this morning rose to 49.3 feet, and rose to 49.5 feet in the afternoon, due to the flow of the Han River. Hydraulic experts believe that if there is no rain, the overall future can still be optimistic. The water levels in Chongqing, Yichang, and Wanxian all fell today, and there were no changes in the lower reaches. At present, the only major levee that has collapsed is one along Shashi and Jianzhou, and the rest are small levees. This afternoon, a hole was discovered in the Jiang'an levee of the German concession, and water poured in. Hundreds of workers are now performing emergency repairs, and there are many spectators. According to the Public Security Bureau, 3,508 houses have been flooded along the Yangtze River in Hankou, and 16,0277 residents have suffered. A section of the Zhanggong Dike is said to be in a dangerous situation, and 1,500 workers are working day and night to protect the dike. (11th Reuters News Agency)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chairman Zhang Qun of Hubei Province returned to Hankou by Chongqing plane of China Aviation Corporation on the morning of the 11th to handle flood prevention affairs. (11th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) Zhang Qun returned to Hankou by mail plane from Beijing at 1:30 p.m. on the 11th. Jin Jutang and others welcomed him at the site. Zhang took a car to inspect the flood prevention situation in the Fenzhou area. At 2:30 p.m., Zhang went to the Sui Office to visit He Chengrong to discuss flood prevention and disaster relief matters. At 3:30, he resigned and reporters went to visit. He gave the following remarks: I learned in Beijing that the river water was rising daily and the situation in Wuhan was critical, which was very worrying. I have successively cabled all parties concerned, hoping to cooperate sincerely and overcome difficulties together. On the 10th, I received a telegram from He urging me to return, so I flew from Beijing to Hankou on the morning of the 11th. Regarding the flood prevention and disaster relief plan, I think the Water Disaster Relief Association decided to be established by the military headquarters should be established on a certain day. The provincial government should first use 100,000 yuan to deal with emergency relief, and then ask the central government for relief funds and construction funds for fundamental relief. I hope that all walks of life in Wuhan will take the spirit of last year's disaster relief and famine preparation meeting as a model for future flood prevention and disaster relief. Zhang continued, Hubei's finances are in extreme distress, but this is a common disease in the world, not unique to Wuhan. I have already prepared a detailed plan this time, and I will announce it after convening the Chamber of Commerce and all walks of life to carefully consider it. (11th Central News Agency)</p>

<h3 id="e10">The Question of the Revival of the Pawnshop Industry <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Qing</p>
<p>The Pawnshop Industry Association of this city recently stated that business has been sluggish for its members. Profits have decreased sharply. Losses are considerable. Those that cannot maintain operations and have closed their doors are following one another in quick succession. Furthermore, the selling price of goods that have reached the expiration date for redemption is only 60% of the pawned value. For example, if the average value of goods that have reached the expiration date is 20,000 yuan per pawnshop per year, the selling price is only 12,000 yuan. It has a loss of 8,000 yuan, which is obviously a fatal blow. The annual consumption of each household exceeds 10,000 gold. It relies entirely on the meager interest income. How can it be used to supplement the losses and maintain operations without collapsing? If this continues, if measures are not taken quickly to save it, it will inevitably collapse entirely and close down completely within two years. In order to seek partial self-help, an appeal has been made to the municipal authorities to approve the shortening of the pawned goods' expiration date to twelve months, so as to avoid the long-term preservation of pawned goods. In recent years, the pawned goods are often abandoned by the pawnors. The majority of these are clothes, which have become outdated due to changes in style and are no longer of interest. In addition, the price of goods has plummeted below the pawned value. It is naturally hopeless to seek to sell them without incurring losses. If the pawned goods' expiration date is shortened by half a year, this difficulty can be expected to be slightly reduced. The circulation of capital for pawnshops can also be slightly more flexible.</p>
<p>The decline of the pawnshop industry, as we know, is not unique to this city. It is not even a recent special phenomenon. In the past decade, the pawnshop industry throughout the country has been heading towards decline at all times. However, the response in cities has been slightly delayed. The disastrous scene only began to appear in the past two years. Even those in the pawnshop industry have been struggling and have begun to call for help, hoping to reverse their fate. This situation, compared with the past glory, makes people feel a sense of past and present. In the closed-door era, pawnshops actually held the authority of finance and commerce before banks and money shops. Public funds and private capital were all deposited in pawnshops. Even important commercial firms had considerable connections with them, so as to obtain the adjustment of capital circulation. But since the rise of the money industry, not only has the deposit business been hit, but the original commercial position has also been lost. Fortunately, the main business is still smooth, and the impact is not too great. However, in recent years, natural disasters and man-made disasters have been constant. The rural economy has collapsed. The recession has hit the whole country. The purchasing power of the people has weakened daily. Prices have plummeted. Commercial goods have stagnated. The market has fallen into a state of freezing. Since the environment is so bad, how can the institutions that regulate the finances of the petty people not decline with it? The current so-called pawnshop industry problem is not limited to Shanghai alone. The seriousness of the situation in inland towns is no different. Therefore, the root of the problem is also general rather than local. The pawnshop system, its strict organization, has always been unique in our old-fashioned commerce. However, the people in the industry are conservative and only know how to stick to the old rules. Compared with the emerging financial institutions, the organization is actually far inferior. Therefore, if you want to seek the revival of the pawnshop industry, if you only aim at shortening the expiration date, it is unlikely to succeed. It seems that you should start with improving the system. Funds should be enriched as much as possible. Business should be expanded as appropriate. Accounting and custody should be improved accordingly. As for the expiration rate, it should be more flexible. The length and height should be determined according to the nature of the pawned goods. I would like to discuss the specific methods with the pawnshop industry.</p>

<p>(Hankou) The railway track on Pinghan Road from Minggang to Zhumadian has been repaired. The southbound train arrived in Hankou, and the northbound train only runs to Zhumadian. Traffic north of the station is still blocked. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to road news, the stations from Mengmiaocun to Xin'andian on the southern section of Pinghan Road were submerged, totaling hundreds of kilometers. The track between Guodian and Xiping has been repaired due to the water receding.

<h3 id="e16">Causes of This Year's Flood <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to the person in charge of the Central Meteorological Research Institute, although there are many causes of this year's flood, the distribution of rainfall is also one of the main causes. The rainfall in China is most abundant in South China in May, in the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River in June, and in North China in July. The most abundant rainfall area gradually shifts north, and the occurrence of floods is also the same. The rainfall in June is most abundant in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River. In early July, there was continuous rain in the upper and middle reaches of the Yangtze River, while there was still little rain in the lower reaches and North China. In the past two days, rain has gradually fallen in the lands of North China from Shandong to the three northeastern provinces. Although the amount is not much, the Yellow River has been in disrepair for a long time, resulting in flooding. From the above, it can be seen that the recent rise in the water level of the Yangtze River is all caused by the rain in the middle reaches. The principle is due to the frequent passage and slow movement of low pressure. However, the rainy season has passed, and the storm will move north. If there is no typhoon in the Yangtze River basin, the disaster situation should not worsen. (11th Central News Agency)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) Cheng Ke discussed the situation in North China and Tianjin, stating that diplomacy is more important than construction, and that stability of the local area is particularly important in diplomacy. He plans to go to Peiping soon to meet with Chairman Wang Youlu to discuss everything, and if necessary, he may go to Nanjing to report to the central authorities to avoid misunderstandings. He plans to organize a committee to hire experts to study the reasons for the decline of the city's commerce, yarn industry, matches, flour, and other industries, to identify the root causes and find ways to help. (Special dispatch, 11th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Cheng Ke stated that the reorganization of the Tianjin Municipal Government is still being studied by experts, and it is planned to reorganize the current scope. The Special Zone Power Plant needs up to 400,000 yuan, but the municipal treasury is empty, and it is necessary to incur foreign debt. Whether this plan of "robbing Peter to pay Paul" is feasible will also be decided after review by the relevant departments. The division of authority between the Municipal Public Security Bureau and the police force has been submitted to the Municipal System Review Committee for discussion and has not yet been decided. Regarding the Tianjin Municipality's contribution to the Hebei Provincial Government and the Military Sub-Committee, the 80,000 yuan for the Hebei Provincial Government has been suspended since June. The contribution to the Military Sub-Committee has been allocated to the central authorities since June, and the Military Sub-Committee has repeatedly telegraphed not to suspend it, stating that it has been listed as the expenses for the 32nd Army. However, given the various financial needs of the municipal government, it is really unable to bear the burden for external parties. He has, in his personal capacity, telegraphed Chairman Chiang and the Ministry of Finance again to explain the difficulties, but has not yet received a reply. The current lack of local funding prevents the overall planning of all construction projects. He has been in office for over ten days and has been busy dealing with foreign affairs and security issues, and has not yet had fundamental discussions on construction matters.

<p>Kobe Staff Officer Kita, a major general and chief of the China Section of the General Staff Office, who was specially dispatched by the Central Army Department to China to inspect various places, returned to Kobe on the 11th aboard the Yamato Maru. According to him, the reason for the early resolution of the recent North China Incident lies in the extreme financial constraints in China and the increased level of understanding by the Chinese government towards Japan. The atmosphere in North China has cleared up, but it is unknown when various secret societies might cause incidents. We must not reduce our attention to the situation in North China. In the future, Wang Kemin will cooperate with Japan to strive to restore economic power. (Japan United Press dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today the U.S. Navy's plan to expedite the construction of warships and aircraft in two years, stating that the warship construction program now underway is intended to bring the U.S. Navy up to the strength stipulated in existing naval treaties by 1942. It has been learned that the program provides for the construction of 555 aircraft within this fiscal year, of which only 282 will be used to replace old aircraft. As for the warship construction program in two years, it will include 27 new destroyers and 12 new submarines. Twelve destroyers and six submarines have already been decided, and the rest are still being announced today. Bids will be opened next month. Swanson said that naval officers are currently considering whether to request the appropriation of funds within this fiscal year to build a new battleship. If so, that ship will be the first of seven old ships to be replaced. Swanson also said that although the naval treaty will expire on January 1, 1937, the current U.S. warship construction program still adheres to the spirit of the treaty, and all the plans announced today are not contrary to existing treaties. (National News Agency dispatch, 10th)</p>
<p>(Washington) US Secretary of the Navy Swanson announced today the US warship construction program, saying that Germany's decision to increase its naval strength has no relation to European events or US plans. The US Navy is willing to abide by the Washington and London naval treaties, but only if other signatory countries also abide by the scope of the treaty. According to the Vinson Act, the US fleet must build 36 destroyers and 18 submarines in order to meet the strength stipulated in the treaty in 1942. Of the seven US battleships, one will reach retirement age when the Washington Treaty expires, but it has not yet been decided whether to replace it. The construction of each ship that has been decided will begin on January 1, 1937. The 1936 program, starting in July 1936, includes the construction of 12 destroyers and 6 submarines.

<p>(Paris) There will be two major demonstrations on the French National Day on July 14 this year. One is a demonstration organized by various left-wing parties and anti-fascist committees, and the other is a demonstration organized by patriotic organizations. The left-wing demonstration is jointly directed by the Radical Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party, and will attract most of the poor and middle classes who support the republican system. The demonstration is scheduled to start from the Place de la Bastille (the site of the Bastille prison, which was stormed by revolutionaries during the French Revolution), a famous revolutionary memorial site, and march eastward to the Vincennes Racecourse in the suburbs, where it will join demonstrators from the suburbs and from other provinces. As for the demonstration by patriotic organizations, it will be held at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier under the Arc de Triomphe. Members of the Patriotic Union and part of the upper and middle classes will participate. Police authorities expect that more than 500,000 people from both sides will participate in the demonstration that day, so they plan to take strict measures to prevent any possible clashes between the two sides. 100,000 soldiers and police will be stationed at various key roads, and subways will be suspended in the afternoon, which is expected to prevent serious incidents from occurring.

According to left-wing newspapers, the leader of the group, de la Rocque, and his young assistants have differences of opinion on several theoretical points and have split up. These young assistants have also won the support of retired cadres of the group, and several leaders of the group's "Nationalist Volunteer Army" have also resigned. (Havas dispatch, 11th)</p>

<p>(London) Tonight, the Chinese Society held a banquet, and many Chinese and British celebrities attended. Ambassador Guo Taiqi presided over the meeting. Among the guests were the Earl and Countess of Winterton, the Earl and Countess of Iveagh, former British Minister to China Sir Miles Lampson and his wife, the President of the Royal Academy of Arts Sir William Llewellyn, Conservative Party Member of Parliament Mr. Lunn, who often asks about Far East issues in the House of Commons, and world-renowned writer H.G. Wells. When Ambassador Guo raised his glass to wish the guests longevity, he said that Sino-British relations have now reached a turning point. In the past, British people always felt a half-hidden contempt for the Far East, while Chinese people often felt that Western trade doctrines were heavily oppressive. But today, these are all things of the past. China and Britain have known each other for a long time, but it may be difficult to understand to what extent they have now reached cooperation between the two countries. Wells replied that the era of making vague generalizations about East and West has completely passed. In the past, people thought of China as a vague land of gods, immortals, and ghosts, but radio airplanes and other inventions have made the distance of thousands of miles seem like a stone's throw away. Therefore, people are increasingly aware that they share a common destiny. Our languages and thoughts are different, so we must work to understand them. If I had several lifetimes, I would use one of them to translate Chinese philosophy. Britain, the United States, and China all have a common understanding of freedom, so they can form a closely united group. All three countries hate the world drifting towards narrow-mindedness and aggression. This is indeed a bond of enviable sympathy among us. The history of the next hundred years may be a history of fierce struggles to fight for freedom. Therefore, we should not regard each other as strangers, but as friends and brothers.

<p>(London) Labor Party leader Lansbury strongly criticized the recent changes of several cabinet members in the House of Commons today, saying that the opposition party does not approve of the principle of selecting cabinet members not based on ability but based on party affiliation. MacDonald's son, Malcolm, has only been in politics for two years and has actually been appointed as Colonial Secretary with an annual salary of £5,000, while Mr. Lindsay has been a Member of Parliament for a very short time and has now been promoted to an important naval position. At the same time, Viscount Sankey was dismissed as Lord Chancellor, as if he were an ordinary worker. What are the reasons for the dismissal of the Air Minister Londonderry and the Home Secretary Gilmour? This is what the opposition party wants to know. Eden does not lead a department but has the title of cabinet member. What is his status? This should be explained. Liberal Party leader Samuel also criticized the establishment of ten new cabinet seats since 1914, such as the Ministry of Aviation, the Overseas Autonomous Department, the Ministry of Labor, and the Ministry of Transport. British Prime Minister Baldwin replied that he is now proposing the appointment of Lord Crookshank as the second official of the Foreign Office. The relationship between the Foreign Secretary and the League of Nations Affairs Commissioner is a temporary measure due to special circumstances. These circumstances will continue for at least twelve months. Foreign affairs are now extremely heavy, and their relationship with Britain, Europe, and the world is significant. He wishes the Foreign Office to have a sufficiently strong staff to handle its affairs. Foreign Secretary Hoare and Eden are both cabinet members and of equal rank. He has very close contact with these two people now. This new approach is an attempt to strengthen the Foreign Office and make it strong enough to cope with the difficult problems it faces today. Baldwin also spoke in defense of the appointment of cabinet members without portfolio, with the reason that precedents can be followed and the needs of the times. (Reuters dispatch, 10th)</p>

"The facts show that the Japanese military clique is using its policy towards Manchuria, Jehol, and North China to deal with the Mongolian Republic. They are following their notorious Hebei-Chahar tactics, instigating conflicts to prepare for the encroachment on other people's territories. The Japanese military clique's insatiable desire for usurpation is truly endless. The robber-like nature of Japanese policy is becoming increasingly apparent. The Japanese military clique in Manchuria is engaging in adventurous actions, which are becoming increasingly dangerous.

<p>(Tokyo) The number of bandits who have infiltrated the forests of eastern Manchuria and fled across the border into Korea due to the suppression by the troops stationed in Manchuria has increased significantly, causing considerable concern regarding security in Korea. In light of this, the Korean Governor-General Ugaki, during Minister of War Hayashi's trip to Manchuria to inspect Korea, exchanged views on this matter when they met in Seoul. Later, on the 11th, when he visited the Minister of War, he again presented important opinions on this issue, stating that "bandits in the eastern border area of 'Manchukuo' are fleeing into Korea under the pressure of the Japanese troops stationed in Manchuria. The Korean army is cooperating with the border guards and police to suppress them. However, when the bandits are pursued by the Korean side, they flee into 'Manchukuo.' If the pursuit is slightly relaxed, they invade again. This situation has occurred repeatedly, making suppression difficult. There should be close liaison between 'Manchukuo' and the Kwantung Army authorities to simplify the cumbersome procedures for crossing the border so that border crossings for suppression can be effective. Appropriate measures should be taken." Minister of War Hayashi shared the same view as the commander of the Korean army on this issue and expressed his support. He will discuss the matter with the relevant parties and study appropriate measures. It is said that concrete measures will be sought soon to handle the matter. (Japan United Press, 11th)</p>

<p>(Rome) People here are paying great attention to the British policy on this matter that will be expressed by the British House of Commons in London this afternoon. (Reuters, 11th)</p>
<p>(London) This afternoon, when British Foreign Secretary Hoare debated diplomatic events in the House of Commons, he mentioned the Italo-Abyssinian crisis, saying that we are now working to salvage the catastrophe by means of the 1906 treaty and the League of Nations. We have not asked France to join in the blockade imposed on Italy, nor are we prepared to implement individual threats against Italy. What we want is to maintain the principles on which the League of Nations was founded. This is why we attach importance to this dispute. We have no other purpose but to see a peaceful resolution. We are well aware of Italy's desire for overseas development and recognize the legitimacy of its accusations against the Abyssinian government on several matters. But is the need for development and some accusations sufficient reason to start a war?</p>
<p>During the debate, the public gallery of the House of Commons was very crowded. The ambassadors and many ministers from France, Italy, Germany, Russia, and China, and eight other countries were present to listen. The debate began at 3:40 pm. Foreign Secretary Hoare spoke first, describing the terrible state of the world left by the last great war, and asked Britain to use its goodwill and common sense to consider its foreign policy. Foreign Secretary Hoare continued to say that the Anglo-German naval agreement is by no means a selfish contract, and he believes that this matter is also beneficial to other naval countries and will eventually promote a universal convention. He is confident that the great powers all want to avoid linking the naval issue with land and air disarmament. In our view, for the sake of peace, we certainly have sufficient reason to establish such an agreement. We therefore take peace as our main objective. When the agreement was not yet established, the German authorities issued important remarks, stating that Germany would abolish the unrestricted attacks of submarines on merchant ships. This promise is obviously also beneficial to naval countries such as France. The Anglo-German naval agreement has given France a permanent advantage, because before the war the French navy was 30% weaker than the German navy, and from now on the French navy will be 43% stronger than the German navy. The Foreign Secretary also said that if we negotiate the air convention alone, without linking it to any other issues, then the British people, having satisfied their current needs, will have no concern for other issues on which European peace depends. The Foreign Secretary later mentioned Britain's policy in the Far East, saying that we attach great importance to friendly relations with Japan, which goes without saying. Our Japanese friends in Britain are quite disturbed by recent events in North China. He made this remark to show that we are honest and open with our Japanese friends. He hopes that this tense scene has now ended, and that our desire for friendly relations with Japan can have a more complete and unrestricted opportunity. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<p>(Paris) Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval met with British Ambassador Sir Clerk at 6 pm, and the meeting lasted for three quarters of an hour. The British House of Commons is scheduled to meet tomorrow, with Foreign Secretary Sir Hoare attending to explain foreign policy. The British Cabinet held a meeting for this purpose. The talks between Laval and Clerk must be related to the opening of the House of Commons tomorrow, and the theme of the talks must be all the diplomatic issues after Eden's visit to Paris, and the peaceful resolution of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute must also have been discussed in detail.

<h3 id="e47">No More Than Two Ways to Resolve <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>(London) Regarding the resolution of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, negotiations are underway among Britain, France, and Italy. It is generally believed that there are no more than two ways to resolve it: (1) To enable Italy to obtain substantial benefits in Abyssinia by peaceful means; (2) To have Abyssinia withdraw its request to the League of Nations for a resolution of the dispute. As for the attitude of the British government, it has changed since last week, because it is difficult to obtain unanimous approval from the Executive Council to impose economic sanctions on Italy in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant, so this is difficult to achieve. Moreover, the Conservative Party strongly opposes an excessively anti-Italian policy, so the government's attitude must change somewhat. All parties in Britain believe that it is better for Britain to help the League of Nations out of this difficult situation than to mediate the dispute on behalf of the League of Nations. Therefore, Britain's new strategy should be on how not to expose the League of Nations' weakness and how to eliminate the conflict of opinions among the member states of the League of Nations, so that the authority of the League of Nations will not be lost. For this reason, the British government has started negotiations with France and Italy on the one hand, and has sought the opinions of League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol on the other hand. The outcome of the negotiations is still unknown at this time, but it is generally believed that the various possible solutions stipulated in the 1906 Anglo-French-Italian treaty on Abyssinia have not been fully utilized so far. The 1906 treaty stipulated that the signatory countries could consult each other to establish a new system in the territories previously agreed upon as the spheres of influence of each country. From this, it seems that after the League of Nations Executive Council announced the failure of the Italo-Abyssinian arbitration committee, it could request the signatory countries to the 1906 three-nation treaty to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute in accordance with the above-mentioned method. However, this resolution method can only be decided after the three countries, Britain, France, and Italy, hold preliminary talks and reach a consensus. At present, there are about two main difficulties in the preliminary talks: first, Italy has various political and economic demands in addition to the control of the territories it demands; second, because Abyssinia is also a member state of the League of Nations, it is factually difficult to hand Abyssinia over to Italy for mandate rule. Regarding the second point, it is generally believed that Italy can adopt another method of managing Abyssinian territory. There is a precedent for this in the League of Nations. For example, Iraq is actually managed by Britain, but nominally it is a suzerain state and a member state of the League of Nations. Abyssinia may as well do the same in the future. Moreover, the 1906 three-nation treaty has already largely defined the spheres of influence of Britain and Italy, so at present Britain only raises the issue of the free use of the source of the Chana Lake in the upper reaches of the Nile River for negotiation, and all other issues can be resolved easily. After the three countries agree on this method in principle, Britain and Italy will probably ask France to initiate and convene a three-nation conference. The tasks of the three-nation conference are twofold: one is to determine the boundaries of the British and Italian spheres of influence in Abyssinia, and the other is to establish a new method of managing Abyssinian territory while respecting its superficial sovereignty. It is said that the British and Italian sides are very much in favor of this plan, but the British government has not yet formally expressed its consent. It is estimated that there will be a decision at today's cabinet meeting. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Compromise Plan Not From Italy</p>
<p>(Paris) The "Paris Echo" reported that the compromise resolution on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, which was circulated outside yesterday, was declared by the Italian embassy in London not to have been proposed by the Italian ambassador. The newspaper also said that "part of this plan was suggested by League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol." (Havas, 11th)</p>

<p>(Rome) Italy's war preparations are becoming increasingly urgent. Troops are departing for Italian Somaliland in Africa every day. Fifty new steel factories have been established in the country. There are anti-Abyssinian propaganda texts everywhere. The famous veteran and poet D'Annunzio wrote a letter to encourage the volunteers who were going to Africa, saying that you will return victoriously from the expedition. If you do not obtain a true Roman victory over the half-civilized people and their accomplices, then there will be no way to fulfill Italy's new great purpose. The Italian nationalists have the idea of washing away the shame of the defeat in Adowa. It is heard that the only chance for a peaceful resolution of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute lies in Abyssinia's concession, because Italy is unwilling to make any concessions. If Abyssinia requests the League of Nations Executive Council to meet, Italy will not be willing to attend, or will attend to cancel Abyssinia's qualification as a member of the League of Nations, otherwise Italy will withdraw from Geneva's request. The atmosphere of war is getting worse every day, and the prices of food and transport donkeys and horses are soaring in Italy. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

He hopes that the spirit of sacrifice shown by the Blackshirt comrades can be a model for the whole country. (Reuters, 11th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) When Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev met with Foreign Minister Hirota yesterday, he proposed that the handling of the Japanese-Soviet-Manchurian border be based on the agreement concluded with Romania in 1923 to conclude a treaty. His intention is to use the example of the treaty concluded by the Soviet Union with neighboring countries such as Romania, Poland, Lithuania, Estonia, Iran, Turkey, Finland, and Afghanistan to handle border disputes. However, the most representative of these is the treaty concluded with Poland in 1933. This treaty designates 50 kilometers of land on both sides of the border as a special administrative zone, which is sufficient to achieve the effect of peaceful handling of border dispute events. However, the Soviet Union has various military installations on the Soviet-Manchurian border in the Far East, so it does not cite this treaty, but only cites the simplest and most incomplete Romanian treaty. Moreover, it is questionable whether the treaty concluded between the Soviet Union and Romania is still valid today after the resumption of diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. During yesterday's meeting, Foreign Minister Hirota questioned Ambassador Yurenev whether this treaty was still valid with Romania. Ambassador Yurenev could not answer immediately, but only answered that he would answer after investigation. It can be seen that the Soviet Union wants to use the simplest and most incomplete treaty as the basis for resolving the Japanese-Soviet-Manchurian border dispute.

<p>(Vienna) The Federal Parliament today passed a resolution by the government to abolish the law exiling the Habsburg royal family. When voting, it was unanimously approved. The inclination of the people can be seen here. The parliament also passed a bill authorizing the government to return the property of the Habsburg royal family, including 12 palace residences and some rural estates. The Habsburg royal family was expelled from the country when Austria implemented the republic at the end of the European War. It has been sixteen years since then, and now they can safely return to their country. Baron Visnar, the leader of the Austrian legitimists, told Reuters that this is only the first step in the Habsburg restoration, and he hopes that the negotiations for the Grand Duke Otto to return to the country can be completed soon.

<h3 id="e83">Wan Fulin's Troops Ordered to Station in Baoding <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>The Military Department's Eight Great Divisions Will Arrive in Baoding Soon; Zhu Hongxun's Division Has Already Arrived as Ordered</p>
<p>Baoding Correspondence: After the Hebei Provincial Government moved to Baoding, Baoding has become the political center of the province. Therefore, the maintenance of public order in the provincial capital is very important. At the beginning of the provincial government's relocation to Baoding, in addition to Yu Xuezhong's 51st Army, the 17th Army's 2nd Division, which was originally stationed in Baoding, also assisted in maintaining the defense of the provincial capital and public order in the suburbs. Later, Yu Xuezhong was transferred to serve as the Commander of the Bandit Suppression Area in the border area of Sichuan, Shaanxi, and Gansu, and the divisions of the 51st Army were also transferred to the Fengxiang area in northern Shaanxi. At the same time, the 17th Army's 2nd Division was ordered to transfer to Xuzhou on the Jinpu Railway Line. Therefore, the defense of the provincial capital was only the responsibility of the police and security teams of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau. The provincial government, considering the importance of public order in the provincial capital, in addition to telegraphing the Beiping Military Branch to transfer troops to Baoding to fill the defense, also planned to transfer 4,000 special police trained by the provincial government in the Caicun Qiangzhou area to Baoding to assist in maintaining the defense of the provincial capital. The Beiping Military Branch then transferred the 2nd Cavalry Division under Huang Xiansheng to take over the defense. After Huang's unit received the order, they sent the 1st Regiment under Zhang Naiqian to Baoding to take over the city defense, and transferred the 3rd Regiment to the Shijiazhuang Zhengding area to garrison. Personnel from the division headquarters are continuously moving here. The Military Branch replied ordering the division to be completely stationed in Shijiazhuang, and the public order in Baoding was the responsibility of the 130th Division under Zhu Hongxun of Wan Fulin's 53rd Army. At that time, the 2nd Cavalry Division only took over the defense of Baoding for three days before moving south to Shijiazhuang as ordered, and the 686th Regiment under Cong Zhaolin of the 130th Division of the 53rd Army arrived immediately after. All the city gates were taken over by the regiment. Currently, the 130th Division has been arriving since the 6th, and the division headquarters is located at the former site of the Baoding Military Academy outside the East Gate. Furthermore, the headquarters of the 53rd Army has also decided to move from the Xiyuan in Beiping to Baoding. The Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau has been entrusted to find the Baoding Xinggong (Imperial Palace) as the army headquarters. The army commander Wan Fulin and the eight great divisions of the army headquarters have sent personnel to Baoding to make arrangements. As for the 4,000 special police originally planned to be transferred from Caicun Cangzhou by the provincial government, it has been decided not to transfer them due to the large number of troops stationed in the provincial capital. The newly appointed Chairman of Hebei Province, Shang Zhen, has also transferred the 725th Regiment of the 139th Division to Baoding, stationed in the Liangjiang Guild Hall, Banmu Garden, and the Erdaowan area near the provincial government. The regimental commander Sun Dingchao has arrived in Baoding with his troops. It is rumored that this unit is specifically responsible for serving as the provincial government's guard. Furthermore, the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau, recently, in order to prevent bandits from taking advantage of the green yarn tents to disrupt the local area, has jointly discussed countermeasures with the Qingyuan County Government. It has been decided to assign the detective team of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau to be under the joint jurisdiction of both parties. In case of bandits, both parties can order them to be arrested at any time. Currently, this joint defense method has begun to be implemented. (July 7th)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Commander-in-Chief of the Guangxi Army, Ye Qi, Dies Tragically in a Horse Riding Accident <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Bai Chongxi Cables Li Zongren About Ye's Death; Li Zongren Rushes Back to Guangxi from Guangdong</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: Ye Qi, the Commander-in-Chief of the Guangxi Army, flew to Hunan in the middle of last month. Having completed his mission by the end of the month, he flew directly to Guangzhou to report everything to Li Zongren, the Commander-in-Chief of the Guangxi Army, and others. On the fifth of this month, he took another Southwest Airlines flight back to Guangxi to report to Bai Chongxi. He arrived in Nanning on the evening of the fifth and had been working at the Guangxi Army Headquarters for several days. On the morning of the eighth, Ye Qi returned to work at the headquarters. Unexpectedly, the horse he was riding suddenly lost its composure. As soon as it left Taoyuan Road, it began to gallop wildly forward. Upon reaching the intersection of Gonghe Road, the horse stumbled and fell, throwing Ye off. His head was severely injured. Medical treatment proved ineffective, and he died within three hours. All circles in Guangxi Province mourned his passing. Bai Chongxi immediately cabled Li Zongren, stating: "To Commander-in-Chief Li Zongren of Guangzhou, and forwarded to Brothers Ji Kuan, Renmin, Yi Zhi, Xiang Ming, Huai Zhou, Mu Yao: Brother Cuiwei (Ye Qi) this morning (eighth) at 6:30 AM was riding to the headquarters from home to work. Upon reaching Xingning Road, his horse suddenly bolted and galloped to the intersection of Gonghe Road, where it stumbled, causing both horse and rider to fall. He sustained a severe head injury. Many Chinese and Western doctors were immediately called to treat him. According to the diagnosis of the surgeon, Brother Cui suffered a fracture of the medulla oblongata extending from the cerebellum. He was immediately unconscious, bleeding from his mouth and nose, which could not be stopped. Unfortunately, he passed away at 9:30 AM today. Heaven is unkind, depriving us of such a talent, truly a great loss to the Party and the nation. The grief is immeasurable. The political and military organizations have already established a funeral committee to handle all the post-mortem arrangements. I respectfully report this with tears. Bai Chongxi, bowing at noon." After receiving the telegram, Li Zongren, realizing that Ye Qi was currently traveling around various places to mediate the current situation, and shocked by the sudden news of his tragic death, urgently needed to return to Guangxi. Therefore, at 1:00 PM on the ninth, accompanied by his wife, Ms. Guo Dejie, Zhang Renmin, the Chief of Staff of the Guangxi Army's Office in Guangdong, and guards, he took a special train on the Guangsan Railway to Sanshui Hekou, and from Hekou, he transferred to the Hong Kong-Wuzhou steamboat "Jiangsu" to Wuzhou. He arrived in Wuzhou on the morning of the tenth, transferred to another boat, and went straight back to Nanning to discuss important matters with Bai Chongxi and handle Ye's funeral arrangements. Ye Qi, courtesy name Cuiwei, was from Rong County, Guangxi. He graduated from the Baoding Military Academy. In 1919, he joined the army, initially under Tang Shengzhi in the Hunan Army, serving as a staff officer. In 1925, when Tang Shengzhi participated in the Northern Expedition, Ye was ordered to enter Guangxi to discuss with Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, and Huang Shaohong about sending troops north. Guangxi sent the Seventh Army to participate. At that time, Tang Shengzhi's Hunan Army was reorganized into the Eighth Army, with Tang as the army commander and Ye Qi as the commander of the First Division of the Eighth Army. When the Revolutionary Army entered Hubei, Ye also served as the garrison commander of Wuhan. After the success of the Northern Expedition, he was promoted to commander of the Twelfth Army, but later resigned from his military post. Subsequently, Bai Chongxi returned to Guangxi and formed the Fourth Group Army, with Li Zongren and Bai Chongxi serving as the commander and deputy commander, respectively. In 1931, Ye served as the Chief of Staff of the Fourth Group Army, making many plans and earning the deep trust of Li and Bai. Now, he has died tragically at the young age of forty.

<p>Nanhui: A Student Surveying Land Dies Suddenly After Drinking</p>
<p>Wang Shuhao, a surveying and arithmetic apprentice from the Land Bureau of this county, was twenty years old this year and from Yongjia, Zhejiang. On the evening of the ninth, he had a drinking session with four colleagues, and then they went to the public tea garden for tea. Wang felt unwell and returned to his residence to sleep. When his colleagues returned, they found Wang breathing weakly, thinking he had suddenly contracted acute cholera. They rushed him to the Public First Hospital for treatment. According to Dr. Sun Youxin's diagnosis, he was found to be poisoned by opium smoke and died. His brother in Shanghai was notified and came to the city on the tenth. Wanting to know the cause of his death, he decided not to prepare the body for burial for the time being. He hired someone overnight to go to Shanghai to invite a doctor to administer embalming injections so that his brother's body could be transported to Shanghai for examination.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Difficulties in Training Township Heads</p>
<p>The county government is organizing training for township heads and bao chiefs. Township heads are required to report to the province by the 17th for training, and bao chiefs are scheduled to begin training in Suzhou on the 19th. However, all the township heads in the urban area are unwilling to go to the province for training due to various reasons. They jointly submitted a petition to the First District Office on the eleventh, which was forwarded to the county and province, requesting urgent training. If this is not successful, they will all resign. County Magistrate Wu is quite hesitant about this matter and will go to the province tomorrow or the day after to seek instructions. As for the training of bao chiefs, although it is scheduled to begin, the bao chiefs are unable to take leave due to work reasons. Therefore, they will also submit a request for exemption from training.</p>
<p>Taicang: Many Inmates Die of Illness in Prisons</p>
<p>Since this county's prison and detention center began to hold opium offenders, the space has been small and the number of inmates large, resulting in severe overcrowding. During this season of the plum rains, the air is polluted and diseases are rampant. Over one hundred people suffer from dropsy, with pale and sallow complexions and swelling throughout their bodies. Death occurs when the swelling reaches the heart and mouth. Epidemics have also occurred one after another. In recent days, the following have died of illness: a robber named Huang Mi, an assailant named He Xiaodi, and opium offenders Yu Asong, Qu Jingui, Xu Agui, Zhu Baogui, Xu Xiaoheng, Zhu Renyuan, and Feng Ziqing, totaling seven people. The speed of death has set a new record never seen before. According to the prison's contracted Chinese medicine doctor Tan, most of the inmates are lying on cement floors, never exposed to the earth's energy or sunlight, and lack exercise, which causes the illnesses.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Labor-Management Dispute at Zhenxin Yarn Factory</p>
<p>On May 17th, a labor-management dispute occurred at the Zhenxin Yarn Factory outside the West Gate of this county, leading to a strike. After the party and government authorities made great efforts to mediate, the situation temporarily calmed down. However, the factory sued Wu Ada and others in court for assaulting employees and damaging factory machinery. The court summoned them for questioning. Yesterday, over a hundred male and female workers from the factory petitioned the county party headquarters and the county government, demanding that the factory be persuaded to withdraw the lawsuit. The party and government authorities have decided to summon Jiang Zhexian, the manager of the factory, for talks to facilitate mediation.</p>
<p>147 Opium Users Wanted</p>
<p>The County Opium Suppression Committee of this county has been carrying out the registration and rehabilitation of opium users. So far, nine batches have been completed, with four to five hundred people successfully quitting. However, it is inevitable that some of the opium users in each batch will give false statements and avoid registration. Although the county committee has repeatedly issued summonses in batches, some opium users still have unknown addresses, making summons impossible, or they are hiding and cannot be found. From the first to the ninth batch, the total number of such people is 147, including Fan Abao. Yesterday, the county committee instructed the Public Security Bureau to issue a unified wanted notice to all branch bureaus and offices.</p>
<p>Huaian: County Magistrate Reports County Affairs to the Provincial Government</p>
<p>As soon as County Magistrate Yao Chongguo arrived, he immediately considered the Huai River diversion project to be of utmost importance. He personally went to the construction site to supervise the work and strictly ordered the workers in each district to accelerate their work. The first phase of the project is more than two-thirds complete. After returning to the city, he convened a joint defense meeting as the summer flood season approached, determined the defense zones, and issued notices for compliance. He also led the security team to suppress bandits in the countryside, causing the bandits to flee at the mere sound of their approach. One well-known bandit was captured and another was killed. Local areas have thus found peace. Regarding opium suppression, past measures were deemed inadequate, with many unregistered opium users. Therefore, after discussions by the committee, a modified method was decided upon and submitted for approval. The baojia system is also being emphasized. The first, second, and third phases of township heads have gone to Pu for training, and baojia chiefs have been trained and completed by the district offices. Together with the security team, they conduct spot checks of households and inspect county affairs late at night. The various measures have greatly improved the situation compared to the past. Local people have praised the efforts. With outstanding achievements, County Magistrate Yao has already drafted a plan for the implementation of the 24th-year administrative policy. He requested leave on the 7th of this month to go to the province to report on the recent administrative situation and to seek instructions on all future administrative policies. All daily government affairs are temporarily being handled by Secretary Li Yusong.</p>

<h3 id="e85">Loan Review Committee Sends Letter Urging Approval of Loan Regulations <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>Since the establishment of the Shanghai Industry and Commerce Loan Review Committee and its active operation, it has drafted loan regulations and other documents and submitted them to the Ministry of Finance for approval and promulgation. Due to the high expectations from all parties, a letter has been sent urging a response. Application forms for loans have also been drafted and will soon be distributed for completion and submission for review. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Letter Urging Approval of Loan Regulations</p>
<p>Cai Zengji, the chairman of the Loan Review Committee, sent a letter to the Ministry of Finance yesterday stating: "The circumstances of the establishment of this committee, as well as the draft articles of association, operating procedures, and detailed rules for Shanghai industry and commerce guaranteed loans, were reported to your ministry on June 26 for review and approval. Only after the aforementioned articles and rules are approved and promulgated by your ministry can all the affairs of this committee be handled accordingly. At present, industries and businesses in this city are eagerly awaiting the implementation of loans, like a severe drought longing for rain clouds. Those who come to the committee every day to inquire and request are endless. Some even blame the slow progress due to excessive expectations, which shows that the economic situation in the city is deteriorating day by day, and rescue cannot be delayed any longer. However, the previous request for approval of the articles and rules has not yet received a reply, and all affairs cannot be started. This committee witnesses the difficulties and deeply understands the heavy responsibility. We hereby send another letter to request your ministry to quickly approve the various articles and rules and promulgate them immediately to benefit the committee's work and comfort the public's expectations. We are extremely eager."</p>
<p>Application Forms Have Been Printed</p>
<p>As for the loan application forms, etc., after being approved by the subcommittee the day before, they have been printed separately. It is reported that after the articles and rules are promulgated, the prepared credit loan application forms, etc., will be sent to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and distributed to various trade associations for applicants from each industry to fill out and submit to the association for review. Non-members of trade associations can also obtain application forms from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and submit them for review. As for the mortgage loan application forms, they will likely be submitted to various lending banks (such as the Central Bank, Bank of China, Bank of Communications, etc.) for applicants to fill out. All applications that have been reviewed and qualified by the committee in accordance with the articles and rules can be granted loans.</p>

<p>There are approximately 50,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, most of whom are engaged in business in the Philippines. The sale of domestic goods in the Philippines has been very developed in the past, often dominating the Philippine market. Recently, neighboring countries have been selling low-priced goods in the Philippines, causing the sales of Chinese goods in the Philippine market to plummet. If no immediate measures are taken to save the situation, the livelihood of more than 50,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines will be cut off. The reasons for the failure of Chinese goods in the Philippines include the heavy blow from the dumping of goods by neighboring countries, but the trend of decline should also include the following points: (1) Exchange rate impact, (2) High tariffs, (3) Excessive freight, resulting in excessively high costs, making it impossible to compete with others. Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce and overseas Chinese in the Philippines jointly formed the China-Philippines Trade Promotion Association to address the decline of Chinese goods in the Philippines, plan future strategies to promote trade with the Philippines, and send representatives Ding Hongxiang and Chen Cailiang to Beijing to request guidance and assistance from the government to develop trade with the Philippines, rescue overseas Chinese in the Philippines, and take the opportunity to promote the external sales of domestic products.</p>

<p>The various shipping companies within the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association previously discussed reducing the salaries of ship crews from July 1st, which triggered strong opposition from the three groups of marine engineers, navigators, and radio operators, as well as thirteen groups including marine engineers, navigators, and sailors from Nanshi, almost leading to a major strike. Now that this matter is about to disappear invisibly, it is of great concern to the shipping industry. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Softening Attitude of Sanbei</p>
<p>Sanbei Company first reduced the salaries of ship crews to 80% from July 1st, with a uniform discount for those earning more than 50 yuan. All the ship crews requested that Yu Qiaqing exempt them from the reduction. Yu initially refused, but after the ship crews requested that the back pay be paid first and then discuss the salary reduction, Sanbei Company could not help but hesitate. Therefore, its response to the three groups of marine engineers, navigators, and radio operators was that the salary reduction matter is currently being negotiated with the ship crews and a satisfactory solution that both parties can understand is expected.</p>
<p>Other Declarations of No Reduction</p>
<p>Since the three groups of ship crews issued a notice limiting each shipping company to clearly state its attitude on whether to reduce salaries within three days, companies that are not members of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association, such as Dalu Company and Antong Company, have formally sent letters to the marine engineers, navigators, and radio operators stating that since they are not members of the association, there will be no salary reduction and the original amount will still be paid. Other companies, such as Datong and Dada, have also verbally notified that they will not reduce the salaries of ship crews. Ning Shao Company said that if other companies do not reduce, they will follow suit. All the shipping companies, in view of the problems arising from the salary reduction matter, are all silent and dare not issue any more salary reduction notices.</p>
<p>Resumption of Salaries for Dazhen Ship Crews</p>
<p>Due to the suspension of navigation of the Dazhen Shipping Company's Yongping and Yongan vessels, the ship crews have been receiving 60% of their salaries for a long time. After the issue of salary reduction arose, the ship crews of the two vessels have requested the company authorities to restore the full salary from July 1st. If they continue to receive 60% of their salaries, it would be similar to a salary reduction, which may cause misunderstandings by other companies and difficulties for both ship crews and shipping companies. Negotiations are currently underway.</p>
<p>Impact on China Merchants Steam Navigation Company Ship Crews</p>
<p>The China Merchants Steam Navigation Company is not a member of the Shanghai Shipping Industry Association and has always taken an independent stance on ship crew salaries. After the ship crews of the company requested a salary increase, after a long period of negotiation, the chief masters of the ship department revised the new salary increase regulations, dividing them into three grades: A, B, and C, and obtained the approval of the board of directors. It was submitted to the Ministry of Communications for approval and was originally scheduled to be implemented on July 1st. Unexpectedly, the salary reduction issue arose, and the Ministry of Communications did not immediately approve this case, resulting in failure to implement it on July 1st, which affected the ship crews.</p>

<h3 id="e92">Hardware and Lumber Industries Suspend Ordering Foreign Goods for Three Months The National Tariff Commission Announces That Foreign Goods Will Not Be Ordered From This Month <a href="#e92" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c92" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">92</a></h3>
<p>China News Agency: The National Tariff Commission announced yesterday the wholesale price index: The wholesale price index, with a general index of 92.1, fell by 2.2% compared to the previous month and 3.8% compared to the same month last year. Compared with the previous month, all category indexes fell except for a slight increase in chemicals. The five categories of food, other foods, metals, building materials, and textiles showed the sharpest declines. The food category fell by 6.2%. Although Su Tong rice and Min Dang rice rose due to drought and shortage, wheat, flour, soybeans, and other grains tended to fall due to the arrival of new goods or price declines in the producing areas. The other foods category fell by 2.3%. Although green tea exports are not bad, the market price still fell sharply in line with black tea. The price of new goods was much higher than that of old goods when the new season goods were released in May. It is expected that prices will gradually fall back, as in previous years. In addition, raw peanuts fell due to the decline of Cantonese tongs, sesame oil fell due to sluggish sales, and coarse sugar, white sugar, American tobacco leaves, fresh oranges, pork, ham, protein, salted fish, etc. also weakened. Both the metals and building materials categories fell by 3.1%. The indexes of these two categories have been declining in recent months. The Hardware and Lumber Industries Association decided that from July, members will not order goods from abroad for three months, which proves the sluggish sales and abundant inventory. Textiles fell by 3.0%. The cotton yarn and cotton cloth market was quiet due to tight money, and foreign goods were strongly competing in China, further impacting actual sales. All the yarn factories have stopped their machines and reduced their working hours, which resulted in decreased demand for cotton, causing the prices of cotton, yarn, and cloth to fall uniformly. White silk also fell due to sluggish exports.</p>
<h3 id="e93">The Ministry of Finance Yesterday Again Sternly Ordered Ning Shi to Expedite the Return of Savings Deposits; Deadline Expired, No Further Extension Allowed <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>After the Ningbo Industrial Bank suspended operations on the 4th of last month, the Ministry of Finance immediately ordered the bank the next day to fully repay all savings deposits within one month of receiving the order. That deadline has now passed, but the bank has not complied. The Ministry of Finance previously ordered the bank to settle the matter within ten days. Yesterday, the Ministry of Finance again ordered the bank to expedite the return of savings deposits, and also instructed Luo Zongmeng, the supervisor and liquidator, to relay this message to the bank's directors and supervisors. The original text of the instructions is compiled as follows:</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Order to Ning Wen: The Ministry of Finance yesterday issued another order to the Ningbo Industrial Bank, stating that the bank had announced its suspension of operations and liquidation. The Ministry had already ordered on June 5th of this year to immediately return savings deposits and to fully repay them within one month of receiving the order. If the bank's assets were insufficient to repay depositors' savings, the bank's directors and supervisors should bear joint and unlimited liability for repayment according to law, without fail. It has been found that the deadline has expired, and it has not been reported that the savings deposits received have begun to be returned, which is a disregard for the law and harms the interests of depositors. This is unacceptable. Therefore, this order is issued to urge immediate and strict compliance with repeated Ministry orders, to expedite the full return of all savings deposits as a priority, and to avoid intentional delays that would lead to strict investigation. Other debts should also be settled promptly to ensure an early conclusion. This is of utmost importance. This order is imperative.</p>
<p>Order to Supervisor and Liquidator: At the same time, the Ministry of Finance also issued an order to Luo Zongmeng, the supervisor and liquidator of the Ningbo Industrial Bank, stating that the Ningbo Industrial Bank had announced its suspension of operations and liquidation. The Ministry had already ordered on June 5th of this year to immediately return savings deposits and to fully repay them within one month of receiving the order. If the bank's assets were insufficient to repay depositors' savings, the bank's directors and supervisors should bear joint and unlimited liability for repayment according to law, without fail. It has been found that the deadline has expired, and it has not been reported that the savings deposits received have begun to be returned, which is a disregard for the law and harms the interests of depositors. This is completely unacceptable. In addition to ordering the bank to strictly comply with repeated Ministry orders, to expedite the full return of all savings deposits as a priority, and to avoid intentional delays that would lead to strict investigation, and to promptly settle other debts to ensure an early conclusion, this order is also issued for your information. This order.</p>
<p>Regarding the Case of Ning Shi Directors and Supervisors: Luo Zongmeng, the special commissioner appointed by the Ministry of Finance to supervise the liquidation of Ning Shi, also sent a letter to all Ning Shi directors and supervisors yesterday morning, urging them to expedite the liquidation. The original text reads: Sirs, regarding the liquidation of the Ningbo Industrial Bank, the Board of Directors of your bank and the relevant personnel were previously notified via letters on June 13th and 23rd to select liquidators and handle the bank's liquidation affairs within a specified period. One month has passed since then, but your bank has neither convened a shareholders' meeting nor selected liquidators. The directors and supervisors have either made excuses to shirk responsibility or have absconded, clearly infringing upon the rights of depositors. To protect the rights and interests of creditors, this commissioner has reported this to the Ministry of Finance for review. Now, Instruction No. 159016 from the Ministry of Finance states, "The report and attachments have been duly noted. In addition to issuing orders for compliance, it has been found that the bank has been suspended operations for almost a month and has neither convened an extraordinary shareholders' meeting to make resolutions according to law nor appointed liquidators to be responsible for liquidation. This prolonged delay not only hinders the interests of creditors but also violates orders, which is completely unacceptable. Previously, Supervisor and Liquidator Luo Zongmeng's report requesting a thorough review was not received by the Ministry. You are hereby urgently ordered to select liquidators and commence liquidation within ten days of receiving this document. If liquidators are still not selected by the deadline, the bank's directors will act as liquidators to handle liquidation affairs to ensure an early conclusion. Furthermore, it has been found that the bank also operates savings business. According to the Savings Bank Law and the approved regulations of the bank's savings department, directors, supervisors, and managers bear joint and several liability for repayment. The regulations are very strict and should be followed. You are urged to comply with previous Ministry orders and repay savings deposits and other debts within the specified period. If you continue to evade or delay, the Ministry will definitely pursue the matter strictly in accordance with the law, without leniency. This order is imperative." In addition to instructing the Ningbo Industrial Bank to comply, you are also hereby notified to comply with previous Ministry orders, earnestly supervise the liquidation, and report the bank's financial situation in detail. Attachments are enclosed. This order, etc. Having received this order, it should be complied with accordingly. It has been found that your bank also operates savings business. According to Articles 12 and 15 of the Savings Bank Law promulgated by the National Government on July 4, 1934, during the period when your directors and supervisors' legal duties are not fulfilled, you cannot arbitrarily shirk responsibility. Therefore, it is your duty to comply with the Ministry's order within the specified period, convene an extraordinary shareholders' meeting, select liquidators, and expedite the liquidation to avoid any inconvenience. Regarding the aforementioned orders, in addition to complying with the orders to earnestly supervise the liquidation to protect the rights and interests of creditors, we are also sending you the attendance records of the two sessions of the Board of Directors and Supervisors for your reference and action. This is addressed to the Directors and Supervisors of the Ningbo Industrial Bank. From Luo Zongmeng, Special Commissioner Appointed by the Ministry of Finance to Supervise the Liquidation of the Ningbo Industrial Bank.</p>

<h3 id="e102">Gospel for Patients with Kala-azar: Save Three Lives with Two Yuan: Donate to the Chinese and Foreign Relief Society <a href="#e102" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c102" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">102</a></h3>
<p>Since kala-azar (a Chinese medicine name is "Pi Kuai Disease", and the Western medicine name is "kala-azar") has occurred in the counties north of the Yangtze River, the speed of its spread and the number of deaths are more terrifying than floods and fierce beasts. It is indeed alarming. Anyone who is infected is as good as being sentenced to death. Not only is it spreading more and more widely and fiercely, but it also has a significant impact on the people's livelihood and the nation. Recently, Mr. Wang Shuxiang, a gentleman from Huaiyin, came to Shanghai and said that there is an ancient Chinese medicine prescription that has a miraculous effect in treating this disease. It has been reported in the previous newspapers. After philanthropists visited Mr. Wang at his inn and asked for his prescription, Mr. Wang verbally stated that Zuisheng Jun, seeing righteousness and acting bravely, donated 100 yuan of medicine funds and sent it to the Chinese and Foreign Relief Society. There are also many other enthusiastic people who are happy to help, and concerned people from all walks of life have also sent letters to inquire in detail. Because it is too late to return home to reply to them one by one, since you have inquired, I am willing to make the prescription public to all those who are destined. (The prescription is below) According to the prescription, the cost of medicine is only two yuan, which can save three lives. Compared with the value of Western medicine, it is less than one-fifteenth. However, the medicine refining procedures are complicated and must not be mistaken. It is only limited to treating this disease. Although there is a universal desire for compassion, it is limited by the strength of cotton, and there are too many people infected with this disease, which requires a huge expense. The area north of the Yangtze River has always been known for its poverty, and it is difficult to raise funds. If there are those who make this good wish and donate medicine funds, because I am away from Shanghai, you can send this money directly to the Chinese and Foreign Relief Society at No. 97 Renji Road in this port for collection, so as to expand the relief.</p>
<p>(A) Kala-azar Pill Prescription (This cannot be taken if you are not sick) Two liang of alum (must be calcined twice before use), one catty of soybean flour, four liang of woodlice, four liang of black dates, eight liang of angelica, eight liang of brown sugar. This is one dose, grind into extremely fine powder, and make into pills with rice soup and honey. Each pill weighs three fen. Take seven pills three times a day, morning, noon, and evening, before meals, with goose saliva water. Increase the amount according to the proportion. However, the alum must be put into a silver mud pot and refined into vermilion in a large furnace fire before taking it out. After cooling, refine it again. This must be done three times before it can be used. It is most important. Also, the wine prescription is one catty of old yellow wine, two liang of chicken gizzard skin, four liang of woodlice, one liang of angelica, and one qian of safflower. The above five ingredients should be buried in the soil for one hundred days before they can be taken out. Take five qian each time, one or two hours after taking the pills. Drink it, increase the amount according to the proportion. (B) Kala-azar Plaster Prescription, sapling root, kelp, mirabilite, purple millet, castor seeds, purple sesame seeds, and Sichuan lovage, equal parts of the seven flavors, forty-eight liang in total, boil into plaster, each piece weighs three qian, add asafoetida, one-tenth of the previous medicine.</p>

<p>The Special Zone Rickshaw Association in this city is unable to re-pad donations due to the sluggish market. Yesterday, it notified all members to receive photos themselves. The original text reads: For notification matters, all car dealers in the Special Zone pay donations on a monthly basis. The Municipal Public Security Bureau car photos have been approved by the overall resolution, and this office has been delegated to donate on a monthly basis, and distribute business to car dealers to unify the records. Now, due to the sluggish market and financial stagnation, tens of thousands of yuan are needed this month, and there is no way to raise funds. The donation period has arrived and cannot be delayed for city taxes. All car dealers in the Special Zone are hereby notified to prepare all the membership fees payable to this association within three days, pay them to the office, and immediately take back the insurance donation business certificates that they voluntarily deposited in this office with a stamp, and go to the Civil Affairs Bureau to donate photos themselves, without exceeding the bureau's limit, so as to focus on tax affairs.

<p>The tramcar industry in this city has caused a reaction from the tramcar industry in the city due to the resolution of the Public Concession Industry Bureau's tramcar office to increase tramcar donations in the autumn. The air of demanding restrictions from the Chinese tax-paying associations and all walks of life in the concession has been very tense in recent days. In order to seek mutual assistance and contact, the people in this industry have also initiated the organization of the Shanghai Tramcar Industry Mutual Aid Association, intending to develop and prepare for it. Since the preparations began, they have been actively carrying out their work without leaving any effort. The number of tramcar households in the city who have applied to the preparatory office of the association for membership has also been very enthusiastic. As of yesterday, it is heard that there were more than 5,600 households. The preparatory office of the association is deeply concerned that there may be omissions because the scope of the city is quite wide and the same industry is scattered in various directions. Therefore, it has specially sent letters to each car household to universally solicit members. Its notification says: Greetings. It has been found that the Public Concession Tramcar Office has suddenly resolved to increase tramcar donations to as much as one time, regardless of the difficult times, which is extremely destructive to hard work. In order to maintain life in today's sluggish market and declining business, in addition to separately requesting the Chinese tax-paying associations in the concession and the Nantong Fellow Association in Shanghai to ask the Labor Bureau on behalf of them to withdraw their orders and stop increasing donations, in order to promote the overall development of our industry and to encourage mutual contact and emotions, we have also organized the Shanghai Tramcar Industry Mutual Aid Association. Since the initiation of preparations, the number of car households who have come to the association to apply for membership has been very enthusiastic. However, the scope of the city is quite wide, and the same industry is scattered in various directions. We are deeply concerned that there may be omissions. Therefore, we have sent another notification to all of you, asking you to quickly come to the association to register in the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation. This matter is closely related to your personal interests, so please do not wait and see. This is addressed to all car households. The office of this association is located at No. 4 Yongji Li, at the intersection of Xizang Road and Avenue Edward VII, attached to the Nantong Fellow Association in Shanghai due to economic reasons.</p>
<p>In other news, the Public Concession Tramcar Office has recently increased the donation for collapsed cars, causing the collapsed car households in the city to panic. Yesterday, they specially sent representatives to the preparatory office of the Tramcar Industry Mutual Aid Association to request contact and unanimously opposed it.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Regulations of the Railway Department on Compensation for Lost Joint Transportation Luggage; Yesterday's Order to the Two Railway Bureaus for Compliance <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>The Two Railway Bureaus yesterday received an order from the Railway Department stating that, according to a case presented by the Business Department, the 162nd proposal of the 9th National Railway Transportation Conference concerned the lack of a market price to determine the compensation amount for lost luggage transported by freight cars and the difficulty in verifying the value declared on the consignment note. It proposed that compensation standards be established. The 130th resolution of the conference resolved to handle it according to the compensation value stipulated in the passenger car transportation regulations, and to note it in the cargo classification table. Upon review, this was deemed feasible and approved for implementation. In addition to noting in the baggage section (personal belongings) of the 30th category of the classification table (if there is compensation for loss, the limit of compensation price shall be handled in accordance with Article 71 of the passenger car transportation regulations) and issuing separate orders, the Two Railway Bureaus are hereby ordered to comply. This order includes the text of Article 71 of the passenger car transportation regulations: "For luggage handed over to the railway for transportation or storage, if there is any loss or damage due to the railway's fault, the railway shall be responsible for compensation according to the verified value. However, the maximum limit shall be as follows: (A) Suitcases, leather bags, or boxes: up to 100 yuan per piece; (B) Bedding: up to 30 yuan per bundle; (C) Baskets: up to 10 yuan per piece, and the railway is not responsible for any loss of items inside the basket. For insured luggage, compensation shall be made according to the insured amount in case of loss, except for natural disasters or force majeure events that cannot be resisted by human power. If there is damage, compensation shall be made according to the verified extent of damage, with the maximum still limited to the insured amount."</p>
<h3 id="e110">Two Railway Bureaus and Xin Yun Company Signed a Joint Passenger and Freight Transportation Contract; Effective August 1st for a Term of One Year <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>For the convenience of passenger and freight transportation in Jiangbei, the Two Railway Bureaus, after consultation with Xin Yun Steamship Company (formerly Fu Yun Company), which operates between Qingjiangpu and Zhenjiang, have negotiated and finalized a joint water-land transportation contract for passenger luggage, parcels, and freight. The Traffic Department has submitted it to the Bureau for formal signing, and it is scheduled to take effect on August 1st for a term of one year. The full text is excerpted as follows:</p>
<p>Article 1 of the joint water-land transportation states that the Railway Bureau and the Company shall handle joint transportation of passenger luggage, parcels, and freight in accordance with the provisions of this contract. All current regulations and detailed rules for passenger and freight transportation that do not conflict with this contract shall apply to this joint transportation within their respective jurisdictions. Article 2 states that the Railway Bureau designates Nanjing, Changzhou, Wuxi, Suzhou, Shangbei, Shangnan, and Maigen Road as responsible freight transportation stations, and the Company designates Shaobo, Gaoyou, Baoying, Huaicheng, Qingjiang, Taixian, and Liubu as passenger and freight connecting stations. Other stations and ports may be expanded upon mutual agreement when needed. Article 3 states that the freight charges for joint water-land transportation shall be calculated by adding the current freight rates for the distances traveled by both parties, based on kilograms, metric tons, and meters as the standard of calculation, and shall be collected in cash only. All goods with reduced fees, free of charge, or on account shall not be jointly transported. Joint transportation passenger fares shall be jointly determined according to the prices due to both parties. A detailed price list for joint transportation passenger tickets shall be provided separately, which shall also form part of this contract. If either party wishes to modify any freight rates in the future, it must notify the other party with sufficient advance notice. Article 4 states that the revenue from joint transportation business shall be reported by both parties in lists every ten days and settled monthly. The monthly joint transportation reports shall be exchanged by both parties before the 15th of the following month for detailed verification. The Railway Bureau shall then prepare a settlement statement and notify the Civil Affairs Bureau for clear delivery before the 25th of the same month. Article 5 states that the revenue from joint water-land passenger and freight transportation shall be designated by the Railway Bureau and the Company respectively, with reputable banks approved by the relevant parties responsible for guaranteeing and collecting and paying on schedule without delay.</p>
<p>Article 6 of passenger and freight transportation states that, when necessary for the transportation of large numbers of passengers or goods, the originating party shall notify the relevant parties by advance telegram to prepare for connection. Article 7 states that the destination station or port shall be responsible for checking and processing the freight, luggage, or parcel tickets for joint water-land transportation. If there is an error and the destination station or port fails to detect it, if the amount is short-collected and the consignee or consignor fails to pay the shortfall, and it is impossible to recover it, then the shortfall shall be borne equally by the originating and destination Railway Bureau or Company. If there is an overcollection and it is impossible to refund it, the overcollection shall be divided equally between the originating and destination Railway Bureau or Company. Article 8 states that the format of joint water-land passenger tickets and documents shall be in accordance with railway regulations for uniformity. If there is a need for changes, they shall be discussed and agreed upon by both the Railway Bureau and the Company. These passenger tickets and documents shall be printed and issued by the Railway Bureau. The Railway Bureau shall bear the printing costs for those used by the Railway Bureau, and the Company shall bear the printing costs for those used by the Company (however, for various documents that are required by the Railway Bureau alone and the Company is requested to fill out, the blank documents shall be provided by the Railway Bureau). For various stamps required for joint transportation, both parties shall determine the style and engrave them separately for their own use. Article 9 states that the costs of joint promotional materials for joint water-land transportation shall be shared equally by both parties. Other costs belonging to one party shall be borne by that party. Promotional materials shall also be sent to each other at any time for application. Article 10 states that the Company may send unencrypted telegrams or use telephones free of charge at each joint transportation station for official business related to joint transportation, but it must be approved and signed by the stationmaster.</p>
<p>Article 11 on Company commissions states that the Railway Bureau shall pay the Company a commission based on the total net revenue earned by the Railway Bureau from the Company's monthly joint passenger and freight transportation revenue. For each month less than 5,000 yuan, a commission of 1.5% shall be paid. For revenue above 5,000 yuan, a commission of 3% shall be paid. However, joint passenger and freight revenue from shipments sold by the Railway Bureau shall not be subject to commission. Article 12 states that the detailed rules for joint water-land passenger and freight transportation shall be discussed separately and form part of this contract. Article 13 states that the benefits stipulated in this contract may not be transferred without the written consent of the Railway Bureau. In case of violation, the Railway Bureau may cancel the contract. Article 14 states that the effective period of this contract shall be from August 1, 1935 to July 31, 1936, tentatively set for one year. Both parties shall notify each other one month before the expiration of the contract as to whether or not to continue it. If the contract is terminated upon expiration, the joint transportation matters occurring within the validity period of the contract shall continue to be handled and enjoy various rights. Article 15 states that any matters not covered by this contract may be notified in writing at any time and revised by both parties through consultation. Article 16 states that this contract is signed in duplicate original, with each party holding one copy as evidence of good faith. Another copy is kept by the Railway Bureau for record.</p>

Zheng Zhenghe Construction Company has been hired to build one hundred large airplane-style pavilions, symbolizing the effectiveness of production and construction and national aviation salvation. Everything is proceeding smoothly with the generous support of all sectors. It is understood that the association's standing committee has resolved to hold the opening ceremony on the 20th of this month, and has invited Wei Tingrong, a leader in the French Concession, to cut the ribbon, with Mrs. Wei cutting the ribbon, to show solemnity and promote the cause.

<p>The Municipal Education Bureau ordered the seizure and banning of the second issue of "Phenomenon Comics" published by the Phenomenon Books Publishing House and the book "Introduction to Social Science" published by the Modern Bookstore, both because they had not been reviewed or promoted reactionary content. Personnel were dispatched to search the respective publishing houses, confiscating copies of "Phenomenon Comics". It was heard that they were publicly verified and destroyed in the square next to the bureau yesterday.</p>

<p>The Yu-style Chinese typewriter, patented by the Ministry of Industry of the National Government, was successfully invented in 1930. Through continuous improvements, the machinery manufacturing has become exquisite and convenient to use in recent years. Various levels of government agencies of the National Government, as well as Central, China, Communications, Transportation, Zhejiang Xingye, Xinhua, Continental, and Sichuan-Kang banks have purchased up to 500 units, resulting in the original cooperative factory's production being insufficient to meet social demand. It is heard that, for the sake of industrial development, the factory applied to the Shanghai Municipal Social Bureau for a public offering of shares the day before yesterday. The office is now located at No. 115 Hankou Road, Shanghai, displaying various products and welcoming visitors and investors from all walks of life.</p>
<h3 id="e114">Rent Reduction Association's Petition to the Public Security Bureau Regarding the Baoxingli Case Unsuccessful; Representative of Tongfu Company Agrees to Convey to Shareholders' Meeting <a href="#e114" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c114" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">114</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the store strike in the Baoxingli area, the Shanghai Rent Reduction Committee, upon resolution of the representative assembly, sent Chen Jiufeng, Zhang Xianfang, Zheng Xiaolin, Wang Jingdong, Wang Xianjue, Zheng Jianbo, and six other representatives to negotiate with the landlord Tongfu Company yesterday morning at 10:00 AM. The company replied that Hu Jianbo, the executive director of the Baoxingli Rent Reduction Branch, was not a formal tenant (i.e., not a second landlord but a third landlord). If mediation was desired, Hu should first be removed and the rent reduction branch abolished. The representatives replied that if the landlord could reduce the rent, the rent reduction association could be dissolved. Therefore, the landlord should first implement rent reduction. The company representative agreed to convey this intention to the shareholders' meeting for a decision. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, the six representatives went to the Public Security Bureau to petition. The Public Security Bureau stated that the members of the association were complex and the organization was illegal. They had inquired with the Municipal Party Department and the Social Bureau, and the reply was that it had not been registered. Moreover, since the association had not been closed down, the strike by the merchants was considered meddling. Jin Zhongjian of the Second Section only received them in a personal capacity, advising them to quell the situation and bring peace, but without result, they returned.</p>

<h3 id="e116">Robbery of Collector at Hongchang Money Exchange; Fierce Gunfight with Police; Two Robbers Fled in Panic but Ultimately Captured; Robber Opens Fire, Wounding Officer and Bystander in Hot Pursuit <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>At around 3:00 PM yesterday, Hongchang Money Exchange at No. 413 Sichuan Road instructed Liu Yuqing, a 24-year-old runner from Ba County, to collect over 7,000 yuan in outstanding debts from a rice shop at the intersection of Changan Road and Guangfu Road in Zhabei. Liu immediately hired a rickshaw, instructing the driver, Yong Caifu, to pull him to Zhabei. A total of 7,000 yuan in cash was collected, divided into two bundles: one of 5,000 yuan and one of 2,000 yuan. Unexpectedly, Liu's movements had been noticed by bandits. As Liu prepared to return to the Exchange, his rickshaw was stopped by four or five bandits next to New Zha Road, near the New Zha Bridge; one of the bandits had a gun. They ordered Liu to get out of the rickshaw, forcibly dragged him into a nearby dark alley called Yongshou Lane, and demanded that he hand over the banknotes. Knowing he had encountered robbers, Liu desperately clutched the two bundles of banknotes tightly. Seeing that Liu refused to comply, the bandits joined forces to seize the bundle of 5,000 yuan in cash and fled out of the lane. Liu Yuqing gave chase, but it was too late. He only saw two robbers crossing New Zha Bridge and escaping towards Wuzhen Road in the Chinese district. Liu's rickshaw driver was very alert. Knowing that his master had met with trouble, he rushed to the Huafu police station near the New Zha Bridge to report the incident, indicating that the two people running ahead were the robbers. Upon receiving the report, the patrol officer frantically blew his whistle and chased after them towards the north side of the bridge. Upon hearing this, the two robbers turned towards the vicinity of the Wuzhen Road police station. The police officers at the Wuzhen Road police station were already guarding the area. Seeing two men in short clothes running desperately, they immediately ordered them to stop. The robber in the lead, seeing that the police officers had surrounded them on all sides and knowing it was difficult to escape, immediately surrendered. The robber behind, seeing his path blocked, turned back towards Gonghe Road to escape. Upon seeing this, police chief Hu Yao and police officer Hu Kuitao from the police station urgently chased after him with guns. Seeing that the pursuit was pressing, the robber turned again towards Manchuria Road and ran towards Mongolia Road. At the Guoging Road intersection, he encountered police officer Li Zhaokui, No. 2303, from post No. 21 on Wuzhen Road, a native of Beiping, who was on duty. Witnessing the scene, he also drew his gun and assisted in the pursuit. At that time, police officer Li, regardless of his own safety, jumped ahead and relentlessly chased after him. Seeing that the distance was not far and fearing capture, the robber, in a moment of desperation, turned back and opened fire, firing three shots in a row. Police officer Li was unable to dodge in time and was shot in the right foot, collapsing to the ground in extreme pain. The robber continued to run forward. When he reached the Gongxing Small Vegetable Market, other police officers had arrived from all directions and were surrounding the robber in the center. Knowing he could no longer resist, the robber was captured. A pistol, No. 48075, was also seized, and 1,000 yuan in stolen cash was found on his person. He was taken to the police station. He confessed that his name was Yu Chuntao, a native of Gaoyou, 24 years old. The robber previously captured was named Zou Shuigen, a native of Suzhou, 27 years old. The remaining 4,000 yuan in stolen cash had been divided among accomplices who had escaped. After the police station obtained the confession, they immediately instructed detectives to continue the pursuit. The two captured robbers are being detained temporarily and will be handed over for legal proceedings. Police officer Li Zhaokui, who was injured in the line of duty, was sent to the hospital for treatment. As the injury was not critical, it was not expected to be life-threatening. A detailed report of the incident has been prepared and submitted to the General Bureau for review. At the same time, a bystander, whose name is unknown, was grazed by a stray bullet when the police and robbers exchanged fire and was sent to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment.</p>
<h3 id="e117">Thunderstorm in the City Yesterday <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>The city has been exceptionally hot for the past three days. The Fahrenheit thermometer suddenly rose to 95 or 96 degrees, setting a new record for the highest temperature this year. Consequently, the poor people living on the second, third, and even attic floors, as well as in the grass sheds in Jiangbei, were unable to sleep well at night and were sleeping on rooftops or in alleyways. Street vendors selling Dutch water, steam water, and other cold items saw their profits triple in a short time. Three days ago, a load of watermelons (about 250-260 catties) at the New Zha Bridge, Old Zha Bridge, and 16 Pu areas of the South City sold for one yuan and there were no buyers. Now, the price per load has increased to about ten yuan. The weather was particularly stuffy starting yesterday morning, with dense clouds in the sky. Although there were brief glimpses of sunlight, they were intermittent. After 1:00 PM, thunder rumbled incessantly and violently. At 1:30 PM, light rain began, followed by heavy raindrops like a downpour. However, the raindrops stopped in less than a quarter of an hour. After 3:00 PM, the clouds dispersed, the sky cleared, and the scorching sun made it unbearable. Although walking in the streets felt relatively cool, the stuffiness indoors was even worse.</p>

<h3 id="e119">Maoli New Ship Makes Maiden Voyage on Shanghai-Taiwan Route; Reception and Viewing Held Yesterday, Departure That Evening <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>The Maoli Shipping Bureau's new ship, Maoli No. 2, has been completed by the Qiuxin Shipyard. A reception for viewing by people from all walks of life was held yesterday before its maiden voyage on the Shanghai-Taiwan route. It will travel back and forth every seven days thereafter. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Completed Construction</p>
<p>The Maoli Wheel of the Bureau has a total tonnage of 805 tons and a net tonnage of 494 tons. The new ship Maoli No. 2 has a total tonnage of 1,134 tons and a net tonnage of 661 tons. The ship is 19.5 zhang long and 3 zhang wide, with a speed of 12 nautical miles per hour. The hull was purchased and built by the French-owned Qiuxin Shipyard in this city, and the construction has been completed. The construction cost is about 130,000 yuan in national currency. The test drive was held the day before yesterday, and the results were excellent. The interior layout has also been completed. Yesterday, it docked at Pier 11 in Nanshi, welcoming people from all walks of life to board and visit. The Bureau sent special personnel to receive guests on board. At 5:00 PM, it made its maiden voyage from Shanghai to Huangyan, passing through ports such as Dinghai, Putuo, Shipu, and Haimen.</p>
<p>Announcement of Sailing</p>
<p>The General Bureau announced, "To develop China's shipping industry and facilitate passenger and cargo transport between Shanghai and Taiwan, the original Maoli Wheel has been well-received since it began operating on the Shanghai-Taiwan route. Recently, due to insufficient cabin and tonnage, we have invested heavily in ordering a Maoli No. 2 double-bottomed fast ship from overseas. The hull is solid, the voyage is stable and fast, and it is equipped with Western-style bathtubs, hot and cold water, sand filter tanks, and hygienic lower class cabins with heat protection equipment, which is especially special. It is also equipped with multiple radios and radios to listen to broadcasts from various places to eliminate passenger loneliness. The tea room service is particularly attentive, and the loading and unloading of goods is particularly simple. The ship docks at Pier 11 in Nanshi and will depart from Shanghai to Dinghai, Putuo, Shipu, Haimen, and Huangyan on July 11. On Mondays, it will depart from Huangyan Haimen and return to Shanghai. It will travel back and forth every seven days thereafter. This is a further announcement."</p>
<h3 id="e120">Fire at Gonghe Cinema on Fangbang Bridge in Ximen; Entire Building Destroyed with Significant Losses; Tram Traffic Interrupted for Approximately Half an Hour <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>The Gonghe Cinema, located at No. 160 Minguo Road, Fangbang Bridge, Ximen, Nanshi, suddenly caught fire at around 5:50 PM yesterday. The entire building was destroyed, and it took an hour to extinguish the fire. When the fire was raging, traffic along Minguo Road in that area was interrupted for approximately half an hour. Fortunately, the Xiangge Police Station heard the alarm and ordered many police officers to rush to the scene to maintain order, which was well maintained. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Construction History</p>
<p>The Gonghe Cinema at No. 160, Fangbang Bridge, Minguo Road, was built in 1915. The owner is Pan Chongde Hall. At the time of construction, the scale was not grand, and the interior layout was also ordinary. However, it was the only one in the Chinese area of Nanshi at that time, so the business was still good. In recent years, major cinemas in the concession have been established one after another, becoming more and more beautiful and scientific. Zhang Zhenshan, the manager of the cinema, in order to survive, spent more than 20,000 yuan last year to repaint the building, replace the tables and chairs with new ones, and install sound machines, film machines, Panaton, and agents, etc., all of which were available. However, due to the economic downturn in all industries, the cinema's business finally declined. On the 24th of last month, it was subleased to a Cantonese opera troupe, which changed to performing Chaozhou opera. The rent was 2,000 yuan per month, and only night shows were performed, which started at 7:00 PM every night, and the audience was not crowded.</p>
<p>Sudden Fire Alarm</p>
<p>At 5:40 PM yesterday, black smoke suddenly emerged from the ceiling on the second floor. A child in the Cantonese opera troupe saw it and rushed to tell the accountant. Manager Zhang Zhenshan immediately reported to the Xiqu Fire Brigade by telephone. At that time, pedestrians stopped and traffic was interrupted. By the time the fire truck arrived, the fire had already broken through the roof, and the flames were soaring, making the fire uncontrollable. When the firefighters were setting up the hoses to connect to the water, the water tap on the side of the road suddenly ran out of water. It took more than ten minutes to draw water and put out the fire. This was all due to insufficient water supply.</p>
<p>Traffic Obstruction</p>
<p>When the fire was raging, about a dozen trams on Huashang Sanlu and French Concession Wulu in that area were stopped near the Chen Ying Shi Pagoda, like a long snake. Traffic was blocked for more than half an hour. Pedestrians gathered to watch, and the road was almost blocked. After the accident, Shen Zhenhua, the chief of the Shenxiangge Police Station in charge, ordered patrol officers and many police officers to rush to the scene to maintain order, which was very effective, so the order was quite good. When the reporter arrived at the fire scene, he saw the fire raging fiercely, with thick smoke like ink. Firefighters were busy working, and traffic was cut off, so he had to watch from the crowd.</p>
<p>Estimated Loss</p>
<p>Later, I learned that Zhang Zhenshan, the manager of the cinema, lived at No. 15, Shouxiangli, opposite the cinema, so I detoured to his house. According to him, the Gonghe Cinema had been open for nearly 20 years. This unfortunate incident caused a great loss, estimated at more than 100,000 yuan. It is said that if the entire Cantonese opera troupe was burned, it would lose about 100,000 yuan. It had insured for 10,000 yuan in fire insurance. The annual business was enough to cover the expenses. From June to the end of last year, it lost more than 6,000 yuan. From January to now, there is still a surplus. The daily income from playing movies, day and night, is about 200 yuan, and the daily expenses are only more than 80 yuan, which can cover depreciation and purchase of property.</p>
<p>Five Rooms Burned Down</p>
<p>The fire was extinguished by firefighters after burning for about two hours. As a result, five rooms were burned down, leaving only one corner of the ticket office floor. The accountant and two tea room staff were taken to the police station by the police on duty to be sent to the Public Security Bureau for verification.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Police to Increase Prosecution for Reckless Driving in Automobiles <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>Recently, the Public Works Bureau's Security Committee received a letter from the North China Automobile Insurance Association, advocating for limiting the speed of rental cars. According to the letter, rental cars on the market drive as fast as flying, especially on roads outside the concession. Speeds of 45 to 50 miles per hour are common, so accidents occur from time to time. Therefore, it is proposed that, because automobile accidents are very complicated, they cannot be judged solely on the basis of speed. If speed limits are set, accidents that occur can be regarded as extremely dangerous. However, in order to prohibit reckless driving of rental cars in the summer, avoid danger, and protect lives, the police can be ordered to pay close attention. If a car is driven too fast and is likely to cause danger, report it at any time and prosecute it. After careful discussion of this matter by the Security Committee, it was deeply felt that limiting the speed of automobiles is outdated today and is not suitable for modern needs. However, the measures proposed by the Acting Superintendent to ban dangerous driving are still feasible. It was immediately decided that the Superintendent should issue a notice to all police stations in the concession to pay special attention to the degree of danger of automobile driving and to report it at any time so that it can be detained. In addition to the above-mentioned rental cars, there are also cargo trucks and automobiles of the armed forces of various countries that often crash and disregard road regulations. These should also be paid attention to and notified to the headquarters of the armed forces of various countries to curb them. It is reported that the Board of Directors of the Public Works Bureau has approved and implemented the above items.</p>
<h3 id="e122">Police Continue to Crack Down on Trams Exceeding Passenger Limits, Three Measures Defined <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the issue of trams and buses exceeding passenger limits, the Public Works Bureau's Security Committee held a meeting on the 25th of last month, and the Acting Superintendent reported on the investigation and crackdown results. According to the Acting Superintendent's opinion, the crackdown measures should continue to be implemented. On the one hand, whether trams and buses exceed passenger limits should still be strictly checked. Those with serious cases should be prosecuted, and those with minor violations should be given appropriate warnings. On the other hand, if tram companies or bus companies can take the following two measures, it will not be extremely difficult to comply with Section 1 of Article 36 of the traffic regulations. The so-called three measures are: (1) During peak hours for going to and from work, trams should drive straight without stopping or opening the door when they are full; (2) If a tram is full and passengers still want to climb on, the tram should stop and wait for the latecomers to exit before starting again; (3) Install a counting rotary machine so that the ticket seller can immediately stop the machine with one kick, and passengers will not be allowed to board again. As for whether there will be any inconvenience to passengers after the above measures are implemented, someone also asked about it at the meeting. According to the Acting Superintendent's view, if the companies can actively cooperate with the police, it will not hinder the convenience of passengers. After a general discussion, it was immediately decided to adopt the Acting Superintendent's proposal, continue to crack down on trams and buses exceeding passenger limits, check them at any time, and prosecute or give appropriate warnings to those with serious cases. It is reported that the Board of Directors approved the proposal a few days ago.</p>

<p>Yesterday's newspaper reported that police officers Liu Junshan and Chen Yilong from the Xundao Street Police Station in Nanshi suddenly heard about a robbery on Yuelai Street while on duty. The two police officers bravely intercepted the robbers, but because the police officers were armed with rifles, it was not easy to fire them, so they were preempted by the robbers. Both police officers were shot and injured and sent to Shanghai Hospital and Xiaodongmen Nanyang Hospital for treatment. It is now known that Liu Junshan, the injured police officer at Nanyang Hospital, was shot in the right waist. The bullet was removed from his back by the doctor. Because the injury was very severe, he was unconscious. He had several episodes yesterday. According to the doctor, the internal organs, liver, and kidneys in Liu's abdomen were pierced and damaged by the bullet. His suffering is self-evident, and his life is in great danger. Jin Dianyang, the chief of the police station, personally went to the hospital again yesterday to comfort him and told him to rest assured and seek medical treatment. He also instructed police chief Wang Zuoxian and others to conduct a thorough investigation of the robbers and bring them to justice.</p>

<p>Sun Enpei from Jiangxi and Zhou Shousong from Wuxi, students at Datong University on Nanshi Railway Station Road, both boarding students, were recently reported to the Ximen Branch Bureau by Chen Yigeng from Wuxi, resident at No. 22 Zilaihuo Street, French Concession, accusing Sun and Zhou of luring his 14-year-old daughter, Meilin, to stay out. He requested a thorough investigation. The order was issued to send the police to arrest Sun Enpei and Zhou Shousong at the same time, and transfer them to the local court for questioning and detention pending investigation. It was found that Chen Meilin was beautiful and dressed fashionably, and had formed a close friendship with Lu Meifang, a dancer at the Fulai Dance Hall on the Bund of Beijing Road, and a temporary</p>
<p>Movie Actor</p>
<p>Jiang Lianyou Club, and was unusually close, inseparable day and night. On the first day of this month, Chen Meilin was invited by Lu Meifang and another girl, Wu Aijuan, to visit the Great World. They met Shen Gengxiang, Zhou Jianyong, Sun Enpei, Zhou Shousong, and others in the Western Drama Theater. (Note that Sun Enpei and Zhou Shousong had never met Shen Gengxiang and Zhou Jianyong before. A friend surnamed Liang introduced them a month ago, and they became close friends after a dinner. Shen Gengxiang and Zhou Jianyong were idlers who specialized in pursuing women. Because Shen Gengxiang and Lu Meifang</p>
<p>Have Known Each Other for a Long Time</p>
<p>They introduced each other and talked very happily, feeling like they had met too late. The seven men and women went out together and rented the Xi'an Hotel, where they lingered for three days. Then they moved to the Xinhua Hotel and stayed for another two days. Chen Meilin pretended to wash clothes and took the opportunity to go home. Her father, Chen Yigeng, interrogated her strictly. Meilin knew it was difficult to hide the truth and told everything. Chen Yigeng was furious and reported the situation. The case was investigated and clarified by Prosecutor Du Jiasheng, who filed a complaint against Sun Enpei, Zhou Shousong, etc., for the crime of</p>
<p>Disrupting the Family</p>
<p>At 10:00 AM yesterday, Judge Zhang Shao specially opened the Fifth Tribunal for trial. The two defendants hired Pan Zhenya as their lawyer for defense. First, the victim, Chen Meilin, testified that she was 14 years old. On the first day of this month, she was invited by Lu Meifang and Wu Aijuan to go to the Great World, where she met Sun Enpei and others who teased her. Later, they tricked me into a hotel and stayed for five days, not allowing me to go out. The one surnamed Zhou (referring to Zhou Shousong) asked me to go to Hangzhou for sightseeing, but I refused. Although I stayed in the hotel for five nights, the men and women slept in separate beds, and there was no</p>

<p>Etc. After obtaining the testimony, the interrogator ordered the detained Sun Enpei and Zhou Shousong to be brought to the case. Sun Enpei testified that he was 21 years old and a classmate of Zhou Shousong. A friend surnamed Liang introduced him to Shen Gengxiang and Zhou Jianyong. They went to the hotel opened by Shen Gengxiang for sightseeing. As for Chen Meilin, Lu Meifang, etc., they were also invited by Shen Gengxiang. They only met after the introduction, and there were no irregular actions. Lu Meifang is a dancer. Zhou Shousong and I were fooled by these people, and we shudder at the thought of it. We ask for a detailed investigation. Next, Zhou Shousong testified that he was 20 years old. The rest of the testimony was the same as Sun Enpei's. At this point, Lawyer Pan stood up and said that the case was full of dark secrets. A thorough investigation is needed to reveal the truth. The interrogator recognized the need for investigation and adjourned the hearing. The two defendants were returned to custody pending further instructions.</p>

<h3 id="e126">The Kidnapping Case of Li Guanlin's Son: Kidnappers' Confessions Evade Responsibility; Interrogation Lasted Two Hours Yesterday; Case Still Needs Further Investigation <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>The case of Jinxiang, the four-year-old beloved son of Li Guanlin, a local villager residing on farmland at the Li family residence on Route Ratard in the French Concession, who was kidnapped for ransom on the evening of May 13th of this year, was solved by special agents of the French Police on June 21st. Thirteen kidnappers, including Zhao Shoutao and Chen A'er, were arrested successively. The victim was found in Jiangxinsha, Pudong. They were sent to the Second Special Court for interrogation and held in custody at the Police Department for detailed investigation and prosecution. This has been reported in this newspaper several times. The French Police have been conducting a thorough investigation of the suspects. Photographs of thirty-two men and women, including the arrested kidnappers and suspects, were presented to the mastermind, Chen A'er, to identify. He identified a total of thirteen people, including himself, and described the kidnapping, keeping the victim, and negotiating the ransom. Yesterday morning at 10:00 AM, Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Second Special Court, accompanied by Clerk Gao Yanmao, visited the First Criminal Court for interrogation. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi represented the French Police Department in court. Only Ding A'liu and Wang Jinxiang hired lawyer Zhu Dianqing to defend them. The court ordered the defendants to be brought forward and questioned them one by one regarding their names and origins. Lawyer Yao Zhaodi of the Police Department then elaborated on the case, stating that the first defendant, Zhao Shoutao, negotiated the ransom with Jin Sheng and Dong Aqing at the Han Bridge in Zhabei on June 21st. He also acted as a lookout during the kidnapping and confessed that the mastermind was the second defendant, Chen A'er, who is the brother-in-law of the victim, Li Guanlin. The third defendant, Wang Jinxiang, was also a co-conspirator in the kidnapping. The sixth defendant, Yang Shaobai, was also an accomplice to the kidnapping, and similar stationery used by the kidnappers to write to the victim for ransom was found in his house. The seventh defendant, Fang Dalang, provided the location to hide the victim. The eighth and ninth defendants, Su Zhaogen and Yang Hongde, guarded the victim in a thatched hut in Jiangxinsha, Pudong. Although they claimed ignorance, they were actually aware of the situation and should be considered accessories. As for the tenth, eleventh, twelfth, and thirteenth defendants, Ji Xiucheng, Xu Weiming, Jin Heshang, and Ding A'liu, all denied participating in the kidnapping during the investigation, but are suspected of providing assistance. They are now being prosecuted under Article 347 of the New Criminal Code for extortion through kidnapping. Subsequently, Detective Zhou Buguang, who handled the case, reported on the breakthrough and investigation process. After reviewing the report, the court ordered the defendants to be taken down for separate interrogations. The mastermind, Chen A'er, confessed that Jin Heshang and Ding A'liu were falsely accused by him and that he himself was also unjustly accused. At this point, the victim, Li Guanlin, testified that his brother-in-law, Chen A'er, had taken 250 yuan from him and entrusted a lawyer to send a letter to the police requesting the withdrawal of the detectives stationed at his house. The judge questioned Chen A'er about this, and he admitted to it, asking the court to expedite the sentencing of the defendants, insisting on implicating him, and refusing to reveal the truth unless he was imprisoned. The court, finding sufficient evidence of Chen's crime, urged him to confess truthfully, but Chen continued to be evasive. The court then brought forward the remaining defendants, who all denied participating in the kidnapping and claimed that they only knew that it was a case of a man and his wives fighting over family property and wanting to harm the child, asking for temporary shelter, which was consistent with their initial confessions. At this point, Police Inspector Qian Chenglong testified that the police had sent a detective disguised as the victim's representative to negotiate with the kidnappers on May 19th and had seen Dong Aqing and Yang Shaobai among the defendants near the Great World. The judge repeatedly interrogated the defendants for two hours but concluded that the case still needed further investigation and ordered a postponement to the morning of the 20th for further interrogation. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>

<p>Chen Yezhen, a Chaozhou native residing at No. 3 Huicheng Lane, Maidean Road, next to the Great Bell in the French Concession, is nearing sixty years old. He made his fortune by dealing in opium and accumulated substantial wealth. His brother is deceased, leaving behind a son named Fusheng, who was brought up by Chen as his own son. In the 21st year of the Republic of China, when Fusheng was nineteen years old, Chen arranged for him to marry Zhao (twenty-two years old this year), a woman from the same hometown, as his daughter-in-law. Less than a year after the marriage, Fusheng went out to do business and has been missing ever since, for three years now. Zhao gave birth to a son named Caifu after the marriage, who is now three years old. After Fusheng disappeared for a year, Chen drove Zhao and her son out of the house. As a weak woman, Zhao had no power to resist and had to take her son back to her mother's home. Chen refused to provide for their livelihood. Although Zhao repeatedly asked people to negotiate, no satisfactory resolution was reached. Therefore, Chen Zhao, along with her son, hired a lawyer and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against her father-in-law, Chen Yezhen, seeking confirmation of their status as his daughter-in-law and grandson. Upon receiving the lawsuit, Judge Ma Yishu summoned the parties to the Seventh Civil Court for questioning yesterday morning. The plaintiff, Chen Zhao, carrying her son Caifu, arrived with her lawyer and stated the case as described above. The defendant, Chen Yezhen, was represented by a lawyer, who denied the plaintiff's claim, stating that the plaintiff's husband was his nephew and that they had separated. He presented the separation agreement to the court. Judge Ma reviewed the evidence and, finding the facts of the case clear, ordered a debate and then announced the conclusion, scheduling the pronouncement of judgment for the morning of the 15th.</p>

<p>Zhou Guiying, a woman from Changzhou, is now nineteen years old. She had been residing in her hometown and became acquainted with Liu Wang (thirty-nine years old), a woman from the same village, as they were neighbors. Last month, Liu Wang, seeing that Zhou was quite attractive, hatched an evil plan. She enticed her with sweet words, saying how prosperous Shanghai was, with many factories, and that if she could work in a factory, she could earn dozens of yuan a month. Zhou, being young, was fooled and told her parents on the 29th of last month that she was going to Shanghai to work. She traveled with Liu Wang by train to Wuxi, stayed there for three days, and then took another train to Shanghai. Liu Wang knew Zhou Xu, a woman from the same village who worked in a brothel at 76 North Xizang Road, opened by Liu Bokang and his concubine, Liu Wang (thirty years old). Through Zhou Xu's introduction, Liu Wang brought Zhou Guiying to the brothel, intending to force her into prostitution. However, Zhou refused. By yesterday, they changed their tactics. Liu Wang (the thirty-nine-year-old one) falsely told Zhou that she was going out to take a bath but actually took her to Room 407 of the Dahulu Hotel on Route Edward VII. At that time, Xu Jingchang and three others were playing mahjong in the room. Liu Wang left Zhou there and left. Not long after, Liu Wang, along with Liu Bokang, suddenly barged into Room 407, accusing Xu Jingchang of seducing a married woman. Zhou Guiying then brought Xu to the Meihua Teahouse on North Fujian Road to "drink tea" (negotiate), using threats to extort 180 yuan from Xu, or else it would not be over. Xu refused because he had no money. While they were in a stalemate, Huatan Chief Shang Wu and Bao Tan Xie Zhiguang of the Huizhong Police became aware of the situation and secretly went to the Meihua Teahouse, arresting Liu Wang, Liu Bokang, Zhou Guiying, and others. They then went to 76 North Xizang Road and arrested Liu Wang and Zhou Xu, taking them all to the police station. The police chief ordered Zhou to be temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute, while the others were detained separately. Yesterday morning, they were sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. Police Lawyer Qian Xunjiu prosecuted them under Article 298, Section 2 of the Criminal Code for obstructing freedom and Article 346 for attempted extortion. Zhou Guiying and Xu Jingchang testified to the previous events. Judge Yang questioned Liu Wang, Liu Bokang, Liu Wang, and Zhou Xu briefly and ordered the four defendants to be remanded in custody separately, pending further investigation at a later date. Zhou Guiying was sent to the Jiliang Institute for temporary detention.</p>

<p>Zhang Fu, from Yangzhou, works as a doorman at the Shanghai Bank Lodging House at 1760 Jing'an Temple Road. Yesterday afternoon around 6:00 PM, his son, Zhang Guiyuan, nine years old, was playing in front of the lodging house when he saw the bank's car, number 15529, driven by driver Lu Zhangdao. (At that time, there were no valuables in the car, so there was no bodyguard in the bodyguard seat behind the car). The child climbed into the car and sat on it. Suddenly, the car was about to leave for another location, and the driver did not know that there was a child behind the car, so he started the engine and drove off. The child, seeing the car moving, suddenly became frightened and jumped down, causing a severe head injury. A Russian policeman, number 74, of the French Police saw this and immediately ordered the car to stop and summoned an ambulance to rush the child to Renji Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he soon died. After investigating, the police transported the body to the Fei Road Morgue. Yesterday morning, Judge Guo Wei of the First Special District Court, accompanied by Forensic Doctor Zhang Yan and Clerk Wang Zuyi, arrived at the morgue to examine the body. After questioning the driver, Lu Zhangdao, and others, Judge Guo announced that the deceased boy, Zhang Guiyuan, died from a head injury sustained from jumping off car number 15529. The body was handed over to his father, Zhang Fu, who signed a statement to take it back for burial.</p>

Director Zhang Jifu presided over the ceremony, led the attendees in a salute, and reported the number of male and female orphans and graduates admitted in the past thirty years, so that the guests could understand the situation in the orphanage. After the graduates sang the graduation song, the graduates gave speeches in Chinese and Western languages, and sang the orphanage song. Then, Mr. Ji Hao, representative of the Municipal Party Department, gave a speech, roughly saying that the country is now in a critical period of survival, and the country's survival depends entirely on your efforts, so you must be self-reliant and do practical work. He hopes that the graduates will be honest and law-abiding, not have too high expectations, and continue to read books in their spare time. The directors in the orphanage must study hard to save the country. Mr. Lu Zhixue's speech was roughly divided into three points: (1) The several directors of your orphanage are worthy of admiration, because it is not easy for a charitable organization to maintain itself for thirty years, which is entirely due to the directors' enthusiasm for charity. (2) The director has a spirit of sacrifice and service, so the achievements are remarkable. (3) The graduates working outside can bring glory to the mother orphanage. Finally, he praised the speeches of this year's graduates, which were well-organized and natural, which was very gratifying. Mr. Wang Shuxian's speech roughly said that the students can be so happy entirely because of the help of great benefactors. How should you repay this great kindness? I think that as long as you study hard, work diligently, and pay attention to the three educations of intelligence, morality, and physical education, and serve the society in the future, that will be enough. There is one more point, you must not forget the great benefactors who have created blessings for you. Pastor Bao Zhaoqi and Mr. Zhang Junkang gave speeches in succession. Then, Mr. Wang Shuxian was asked to present certificates. There were fifteen male graduates and six female graduates in this class.

<p>To the esteemed editor: I am writing to you today regarding the news in the news column of your newspaper about the amateur drama club's volunteer performance at the Third Shanghai West National Goods Exhibition. Our troupe is the Amateur Friendship Drama Club. I believe the word "Friendship" was omitted during drafting. I am deeply concerned that the outside world may not understand and misunderstand. Therefore, I would like to correct it. Sincerely, to the news editor of this newspaper, Amateur Friendship Drama Club, July 11.</p>
<p>Respected editor: I am writing to you today regarding the news in the local news column of your newspaper, "Wife of the Hangzhou Restaurant Causes Havoc in the Auditorium." After investigation, Mr. Cheng Zhiliang is an unpaid assistant in our association, not a secretary, nor a performer of Shanghai opera. As for Mr. Cheng's marital dispute, Mr. Cheng is, of course, personally responsible for handling it himself and has nothing to do with our association. I am deeply concerned that the outside world may not understand and misunderstand. Therefore, I would like to issue a statement and correction, hoping that it will be included for your convenience and peace. Sincerely, Shanghai Shanghai Opera Research Association, July 11, 24.7.11.</p>
<p>Dear editor: I read in the local news column of your newspaper on July 11, an article about "Hangzhou Scholar Causes Havoc in the Auditorium," stating that "Cheng Zhiliang married into the Ding family, with me as the matchmaker." I am very surprised. After investigation, I have a teacher-student relationship with Cheng Zhiliang. In May of the Republic of China Year 16, when Zhiliang became the adopted son of Ding Quanlin, it was indeed introduced by me. However, the Ding family assumed that the adoption procedures were not completed. As for Zhiliang and Ding's younger sister (the fourth daughter of Quanlin) cohabiting, no wedding was held. Therefore, the marriage procedures have not been completed. The report does not match the facts. Please correct it in your newspaper immediately to avoid confusing the audience. I am very grateful. Sincerely, to the editor of Shen Bao, Zhang Junkang, July 11.</p>

The ticket sales locations are the Liangyou Bookstore and Magazine Company at the intersection of North Sichuan Road, and the Guangdong Swimming Team on the third floor of No. 1316 North Sichuan Road. However, due to the ferry cabin capacity, the team members and guests already exceed 200 people, so the number of tickets sold is limited to 100.

The invitation cards have been sent out yesterday by the Shanshi-run Seaside Bathing Beach. The public carnival tickets are limited to 100 due to the car space problem. However, the news had just been revealed the night before, and six-tenths of them had been removed within an hour.

<p>The short-term primary school textbooks compiled by the Ministry of Education were originally intended for out-of-school children aged 10 to 16. Recently, the Ministry of Education promulgated the "Provisional Regulations for One-Year Short-Term Primary Schools," changing the age of enrolled children to 9 to 12 years old. Therefore, the textbooks also need to be revised. The Ministry of Education has ordered the National Compilation and Translation Bureau to revise them. It is also heard that the Compilation and Translation Bureau has sent Wang Weixin and Hu Yanli to be responsible for the revision based on the newly revised "Provisional Curriculum Standards for One-Year Short-Term Primary Schools" and the words used in the "Primary School Elementary Vocabulary Grade 1-2" compiled by the bureau.

<p>The National Compilation and Translation Bureau recently submitted to the Ministry of Education, stating that it had previously received orders from the Ministry to revise the Ministry-compiled primary school textbooks. The original manuscripts included one copy each of elementary Chinese, social studies, nature, and arithmetic, and one copy each of advanced Chinese, geography, history, nature, and arithmetic, for a total of nine copies. Except for the two copies of advanced geography and history, which were found to be inapplicable after review and investigation, they have been submitted to the Ministry for record. There are many shortcomings in the contents of one copy of nature. After detailed signature and annotations, please transfer and instruct the original compiler to revise it. Chinese and arithmetic are still under review. The elementary Chinese consists of eight volumes, the first volume has been revised and is ready, the second volume will also be finalized soon, and the third volume and below are also in progress. The focus of this revision of Chinese is: (1) to pay attention to our country's inherent morality, etiquette and materials for the revival of the nation; (2) to take children's daily life as a starting point and avoid the disadvantages of falsehood and mythology; (3) to suit the conditions of ordinary rural areas and not to focus on urban life; (4) to apply the biological materials in nature, pay attention to their living conditions, and their relationship to people; (5) the distribution of content, style, and quantity is based on curriculum standards; (6) the new words used are checked against the elementary primary school vocabulary compiled by the museum; (7) the compilation uses a single method to connect each lesson from beginning to end, etc. As for the elementary social studies, there are four volumes for the third and fourth grades. The original manuscript has been revised many times and is currently being reorganized. There are four volumes for the elementary nature for the third and fourth grades. After the revision, it has been sent to various experts for review and revision, and it is currently in the final finishing stage. After the elementary arithmetic of eight volumes was reviewed, it was decided to revise it. The first four volumes were revised in the museum, and the latter four volumes were handed over to the original compiler for revision. A revision plan was also formulated: (1) Take children's actual life as the center; (2) Pay attention to ruralization and popularization, and make full use of production materials; (3) Make full use of simple materials such as labor, nature, social hygiene, etc. to achieve mutual connection; (4) Make full use of various recent statistics; (5) The words used should be compared with the elementary primary school vocabulary compiled by the museum; (6) Use a unit compilation, and each volume cannot have two or more units with identical facts; (7) The first volume is mainly based on pictures, and the pictures should focus on saving, being clear and easy to understand, using less background, and avoiding the disadvantages of complexity and chaos; (8) The pictures also focus on popularization and make full use of common things in the school and family environment; (9) The arithmetic games used in low grades should focus on those that are easy for general schools and children to implement. Now the first volume has been revised and completed. All the situations since February when the ministry-compiled primary school textbooks were ordered to be revised have been reported for review. It is now found that the elementary primary school Chinese Volume 1, the mimeographed version has been printed and is ready to be sent to various experts for review.

<p>Wujin County Women's Normal School, established since the late Qing Dynasty, has a history of thirty years. It has long enjoyed a reputation in society, especially in the recent five years, since Mr. Zhuang Minqiu took office as principal, there has been considerable progress. During Mr. Zhuang's five-year term as principal, he saved money within the extremely tight regular expenses, and strived for construction, both materially and spiritually. Therefore, in recent years, although the Wujin Women's Normal School receives less than 10,000 yuan in public funds per year, which is less than one month's expenses for provincial schools, its appearance and actual staff can be compared with provincial schools. The current principal, Zhuang Minqiu, found it difficult to maintain the school because the school's funds were discounted by the local education bureau, coupled with huge arrears. In addition, he suffered from insomnia due to years of hard work. Therefore, he once submitted his resignation during the spring vacation, which was approved by Qian Hao, the head of the education bureau, with the comment "No discussion for the time being". Since Mr. Zhuang could not leave for the time being, and his health gradually recovered, he took on the responsibility for the school's financial difficulties alone, and became actively responsible for school affairs. Recently, on June 21st and 25th, Director Qian inquired about his attitude twice, and Principal Zhuang made a positive and responsible statement. At 4 pm on June 29, the school received an order from the Department of Education, stating that according to Director Qian's report, the principal "still has the intention to leave", and the resignation should be approved. After receiving the order, Mr. Zhuang prepared to hand over his work. However, all sectors of the local community, as well as the school's alumni, faculty, and students, sent urgent telegrams to retain him, and sent representatives to the province to petition. The provincial authorities are now planning to send personnel to investigate the truth.</p>

<p>Dagong Vocational School</p>

<p>- Chu Minyi</p>
<p>In the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, the school was closed due to student strikes. At that time, it was a pity that undergraduate students dropped out of school midway. Minyi then consulted with the Ministry of Education to send the students to study in Belgium, divided into two batches of twenty people each. The cost of studying abroad was subsidized from the school's funds. At the same time, the school's funds were quite tight, but we tried our best to economize. Fortunately, the students were able to work hard in Belgium and lived up to their expectations, studying day and night, and even on Sundays. Therefore, there was a saying that "Chinese people have no Sunday." Therefore, many of them ranked first in foreign universities and won glory for the motherland. Now, all the students have returned to China after completing their studies and are serving in various sectors of the country, mostly in construction. They occupy important positions in various ministries and commissions of the central government, as well as in the construction departments of Guangxi, Shandong, and Hebei provinces. Their service achievements have been praised by the authorities of various agencies, which is very gratifying. In the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, the Sino-Belgian Gengkuan Committee was established, and students were sent to Belgium. At that time, seven students graduated from the school's high school department, so they were able to participate in the examination and were sent to Belgium by the committee. Now, the students have also returned to China after completing their studies and have their own tasks. Last year, eight students graduated from the school's first graduating class. Among them, the top two, Hua Yigan and Zhou Jiamu, were also sent to Belgium by the Sino-Belgian Gengkuan Committee, Sun Yutai and Jin Sangzhang were subsidized by the Sino-French Education Fund Committee to go to France, and Cheng Fuzhu was admitted to the Ministry of Education's government-funded program to Italy. The rest were introduced by the school to work in various places. This year's graduation examination is being held. After the students graduate, we will still find a way for them to find a way out, so that they can all get what they want.</p>
<p>(3) Future Plans</p>
<p>The school building is still spacious. Some of the houses are lent to the Sericulture Improvement Association and the Sino-French University School of Pharmacy, and some of the houses are temporarily occupied by French soldiers. The part occupied by French soldiers has now been recovered. The Sericulture Improvement Association and the Sino-French University School of Pharmacy are working together on the Sino-French cultural cause, and there is currently no news of relocation. Once a residence is found, the houses will be returned, and the school can strive to expand, such as establishing a research institute, so that students can continue to study advanced industry after graduation, and adding an affiliated junior high school, so that junior high school students can directly enter high school after graduation and complete the two-level middle school system, so that the curriculum can be connected. In the future, if the school's funds are slightly sufficient, the factory laboratory and library can be enriched and expanded. Regarding the way out for students after graduation, we will still follow the previous policy, so that those who are both virtuous and talented can go abroad to study and create advanced industrial talents. We are currently discussing with the Sino-French Education Fund Committee, hoping to send several students to France to study every year, to promote the actual communication of education and culture between China and France.</p>
<p>Today, internal and external troubles have reached their extreme, but with such national strength, even if Guan Zhong and Yue Yi are reborn, what can they do? If we blame and demand perfection and only rely on empty words, it is enough to mislead the country. Only by being persevering, united as a country, burying our heads in hard work, and striving for construction to seek production, can we continuously strengthen ourselves and perhaps survive. And construction is inseparable from talent. Therefore, we can only do our best and strive for this. (End)</p>

Early in the morning, overseas silver markets in England and America were generally lower, but it was said that buyers were content, fearing high prices and a lack of buyers, leading to a weak market.

<p>—After-Market Trading Suspended from Next Week—</p>
<p>Yesterday, at the Chinese Securities Exchange, under the fierce competition between bulls and bears, the fluctuations became more rapid. The market price changed constantly throughout the day. Initially, continuing the previous upward momentum, the market price continued to advance. Then, with the arrival of pressure from large investors, the market price suddenly collapsed, and the wild fall swept away all the previous gains. Later, the financial community rose to support it, and it stabilized. Later, with the rise of many favorable rumors such as the establishment of loans, it was like a strong stimulant to the market situation at this time of virtual market atmosphere. Short sellers panicked and covered, and the rising wind suddenly became fierce, rising straight up. As a result, compared with the previous ones, most of them rose by several jiao or even about one yuan. The trend and future prospects, due to the financial community's efforts to cheat, and the short sellers' chips are crowded too early, may temporarily tend to be stable. However, in this environment of hundreds of holes and sores, I am afraid it will be difficult to last. Yesterday, after the morning opening, continuing the previous closing momentum, each bond continued to rise step by step.

<h3 id="e177">Cotton Yarn  Yarn Price Drops Sharply, Falls Below 60 Yuan This Month <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to decline, and the situation is increasingly weak. This month, it broke through the 60 yuan mark, which shows the market's sluggishness. In fact, the environment is harsh, the financial situation is tight, securities have been declining for days, and people's hearts are inevitably becoming more and more virtual. In addition, the spot yarn sales market is not smooth, and exchange rates are lengthening. However, the overseas yarn and cotton situation is still high.</p>
<p>The Whole Chicken is Increasingly Declining</p>
<p>The bidding yarn opened in the forenoon, and each month showed a calm appearance. The situation was very weak. Changfeng came to sell again, but there were few buyers. As a result, each month fell by two, three, and four jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The market was very weak when it opened in the afternoon. It was heard that the spot yarn transaction was still calm. This month, the market atmosphere was weaker, and it broke the 60 yuan mark again. It is said that a certain factory has a delivery area of ​​one or two thousand packages. In this time of tight silver root, there are fewer receivers, so the recent pressure is particularly heavy. The closing price was within the 60 yuan mark. As a result, each month fell by four, five, six, and seven jiao compared to the morning closing price. The sold Dafu was checked for 2,600 packages, Shenji 350 packages, Changfeng 900 packages, Yongda 450 yuan, Tongji 800 packages, Gengfeng 450 packages, Xinhua 350 packages, purchased Jifeng 350 packages, Mingde 450 sons packages, Hexing 550 packages, Sihe 350 packages, Shenji 600 packages, Dachang 550 packages, Shengyuan 400 packages, Yongchang 450 packages, the highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<p>Yarn Sales over 500 Packages</p>
<p>The spot yarn sales were still normal. The statistics show that a total of 518 packages were bought by various belts throughout the day, and there were still 625 packages of July futures. The market price was flat. The amount of purchases by each gang is as follows:</p>

<p>According to rumors, the July period was heavily shorted. Today, the long positions have spewed out somewhat, and the market has suddenly fallen, showing signs of loosening. However, the long positions bought again in the afternoon, so the trend of the cotton market is still more expensive than the yarn market.</p>
<p>Zheng Standard Turns to Loosen</p>
<p>The market opened before the marker flower session. The situation in the near-term was still tight because U.S. cotton continued to rise, and Indian cotton was especially strong. There was a lack of sellers in the market, but when bidding reached the second and third rounds, the marker price was heard to have fallen. Some of the long positions were closed, and the market price suddenly dropped. As a result, the near-term contracts fell by five fen to one jiao, while the far-term contracts remained unchanged. The market fell sharply when trading resumed in the afternoon due to the poor yarn market and sluggish cotton sales. The market became weaker. The near-term contracts closed down two jiao to one jiao and a half compared to the morning closing price, and the far-term contracts fell by one jiao. It was found that Dafu sold 4,300 dan, Ruitai sold 1,600 dan, Yuanda sold 600 dan, Zhenda sold 700 dan, Xing sold 1,600 dan, Feng sold 1,700 dan, Chang sold 700 dan, Yongchang sold 1,000 dan, and Yikang sold 1,400 dan.

<p>Factory Demand is Only Piecemeal</p>
<p>The consumption of spot cotton is increasingly dull. Factory transactions are only piecemeal. The source is estimated to be 280 bales of Yaohua cotton.</p>
<p>Far-Term U.S. Cotton is Very Firm</p>
<p>Yesterday, U.S. cotton opened with monthly fluctuations of one pound. Although the Liverpool news was unfavorable, the market price was very firm due to the peers limiting purchases and buying near-term contracts, and the government buying far-term contracts. There were not many transactions, but there was demand from peers when prices fell. The overall market situation was not very active, and peers are still waiting for the Senate to consider amending the Agricultural Adjustment Act. It is reported that President Roosevelt said that there is no news about cotton loans for the time being. At the close, there were slight short covering and buying by peers, so the trend is still firm. It is estimated that spot prices rose by five pounds, and futures prices rose by one to four pounds. Spot prices for British cotton fell by one point, and futures prices rose by two or three points. Indian cotton initially weakened due to sales by European exporters, but then rose due to short covering and buying by futures traders. It is estimated that Pingguoer rose by 2.75 to 3 rupees, Aomula rose by 2.75 to 5.25 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 3.75 to 4.5 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (dated the 10th).</p>

<p>Scorching Heat, Only Morning Session Held After Yarn Trading Stopped, Evening Meetings Suspended - From the 5th to the 27th of this Month -</p>
<p>It has been observed that the weather has been hot recently. Yarn trading will be suspended every afternoon from the 15th of this month (Monday) to the 27th of this month (Saturday), except for the usual morning meetings and transactions. All payments and receipts should also be completed before 12:00 noon every day. This has already been announced.</p>
<h3 id="e179">Grains: Only 160,000 Bags of Futures Flour Traded <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the flour market turned flat and weak. The price of foreign wheat was reported to be one jiao higher for the near-term and 88 fen lower for the far-term in Chicago, and four fen higher in Canada. The market sentiment was that very little foreign wheat was coming in. Although the domestic floods were severe, the financial weakness of the disaster areas was also a fact. Even in this city, most people are preoccupied with their own affairs and cannot provide relief as they did in previous years. The so-called economic pressure makes it difficult to cross to the other shore, and the lack of purchasing power is the main reason. The market could not rise due to the lack of actual sales, even though the environment did not allow it to fall. It is said that only about 160,000 bags were traded, and the quiet situation can be imagined. The market sentiment softened across the board due to the wait-and-see attitude of buyers. As a result, the current month fell by one fen, August fell by one fen and two li and a half, September fell by one fen and seven li and a half, October fell by one fen and two li and a half, November fell by one fen, and December fell by one fen and two li and a half.</p>
<h3 id="e180">September and Later Futures Wheat Unchanged; U.S. Wheat Estimate Released <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the futures wheat market was generally weak in the near-term and stable in the far-term. In the near-term, the market inventory was quite high, about 100,000 or so, and ships and trains continued to deliver wheat. Furthermore, due to the recent purchases of foreign wheat by factories, they were not eager to buy new wheat. The market sentiment was difficult to shake due to the pressure of reality. As for the far-term, due to the lack of active trading, those with goods were unwilling to boldly sell them. As a result, the market sentiment stabilized slightly. July and August both fell by two fen, while September and later months were unchanged. The spot wheat market was stable for high-quality wheat, while medium-quality wheat was flat. If the arrival of goods becomes scarce in the future, or this value will not fall again. Kaishan Dong wheat was 3 yuan and 4 jiao and 2 fen, Daqiao wheat was 3 yuan and 3 jiao and 7 fen, Yaowan wheat was 3 yuan and 4 jiao, inferior wheat was 2 jiao and 9 fen, Liuhehu cooked Wuhu wheat was 3 yuan and 3 jiao, Chuzhou Qintong wheat was 3 yuan and 3 jiao and a half, Yanghe wheat was 3 yuan and 4 jiao, Wuyi wheat was 3 yuan and 3 jiao 3 or 4 fen, Puzhen wheat was 3 yuan and 2 jiao 8 or 9 fen to 3 yuan and 3 jiao, Nanjing and Zhou wheat was 3 yuan and 2 jiao and 7 fen. Fuxin took away 10,000 bags, and Xinda took away 1,000 bags.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the total arrival of various sources of local rice (Shanghai South) was more than 20 shipments (more than 4,000 shi). Yesterday, due to the weather and the natural weakening of market sentiment, the sales market became more sluggish. The opening prices were very low, and sellers panicked and lowered prices to sell, causing a sharp drop in the market. The prices of various thick and thin japonica rice all fell by one to four jiao. However, the destination was still not much in this area. Only the Qingdao and Yantai gangs seemed to be more active, handling more than 600 bags. Yinbian Yuan also fell by more than two chi. (Shanghai North) Yesterday, there were few ships arriving from various routes, only about 10 shipments. The market was deserted due to the hot weather, and few shops opened, resulting in extremely quiet retail sales. The market price of white japonica rice also fell by one or two jiao, early thin indica rice also fell by one or two chi, and Baiyuan continued to fall by about one jiao. The prices of other goods also fell by about one jiao.</p>
<p>The foreign rice market was quite active yesterday. The majority of the rice was bought by various ports along the Yangtze River. The demand for rice was very urgent in the Wuhan area, which had been hit by floods, and in other ports that had also been affected by floods. The most actively traded rice yesterday was from Hankou, Shashi, Jiujiang, Tianjin, and Nanjing. The demand from Ningbo and other inland areas in this city was also quite strong. Therefore, although the Shan Yilisi Mala ship imported 45,000 bags of Saigon rice and docked at the Yitai Xing wharf, the market sentiment, which had been flat and weak, was revived by the Yangtze River's purchases. A total of 9,158 bags of Saigon rice, 4,000 bags of small-grained rice, and more than 2,000 bags of Siamese rice were sold at prices similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3 id="e182">Rice Paddies Need Fertilizer; Soybean Cakes Rise Again <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in the soybean cake sales market, factory cakes were pushed down by guest cakes but then rose again. This was because the trend of factory cakes being ground into cash was slightly reduced. The cakes from the interior were sold quickly because they were cheap, so the trading of various guest cakes suddenly became active. However, due to piecemeal transactions, the market price gradually increased, resulting in another increase of six or seven fen. Dou Bing was also brought up by a fraction of a point. A total of three factory cake brands were traded, with 500 pieces, four factory cake brands with 2,000 pieces, 2,500 pieces for forward delivery, 1,000 pieces of Niuzhuang black soybean cake, 1,000 pieces of Lun Qing medium cake, 5,000 pieces of Dalian Guangji cake, 3,000 pieces of Youbian cake, and 1,000 pieces of Shahe Guangbian cake, and 3,000 pieces of Youbian cake. However, the destination of Niuzhuang black cake was relatively small, and the market price fell by two fen. Due to the firm hold of goods by the sellers, the market sentiment for soybeans became slightly active, and factories were already inquiring. Furthermore, the Dalian market continued to be stable, so the market price continued to rise by four or five fen. However, this inevitably created a good opportunity for the dumping of beans from the eastern provinces. Yesterday, 17 truckloads of spot beans from Sipingjie were traded, and 53 truckloads of beans for July delivery were traded, which saturated the factory market again. Therefore, the future of the bean market is feared to be not optimistic. Yesterday, in addition to the beans from Sipingjie, 2 truckloads of Quanhe beans, 2 truckloads of Yingzhou beans, 1 truckload of Bozhou beans, and more than 1,000 bags of Guide beans were traded. Only 100 to 200 bags of Andong Niuzhuang beans were traded, and the destination was mainly factories.</p>
<h3 id="e183">Sugar Market: Domestic Cotton Red Brand Market Tightens <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market was weak and sluggish due to the slight decrease in customs gold and the continuing low sales volume. The guild lowered the asking price for No. 24 coarse granulated sugar and white sand cargo by another five fen, to 15 yuan and 9 jiao and a half, and the re-export cargo was 4 yuan and 8 jiao, but no transactions were made. The asking price for cargo from this company was 16 yuan and 5 fen, and there were few sales. The asking price for Taigu sugar B mark lacked acceptance, and the No. 1 domestic cotton white sugar, at 15 yuan and 3 jiao, also showed signs of weakness. The domestic cotton red, which had been selling relatively actively recently, had its previous market slightly loosened, but demand from all parties increased again, so yesterday's market tightened again. High-quality goods opened at 11 yuan and 6 jiao, and ordinary goods opened at 11 yuan and 6 jiao, with 200 and several tens of bags traded. It is said that there is not much inventory left.</p>

<p>Bamboo-Joint Steel Bars: Only a few construction gangs placed orders, and the market situation was quite bleak. The market price opened at around 90 yuan. Yesterday, only 40 to 50 tons were traded.</p>
<p>Tinplate: The Indian iron factory had a slight improvement. Cigarette factories and thermos factories made no purchases. 90-pound tinplate was priced at 13 yuan and 2 jiao and 3 fen, 100-pound tinplate was priced at 14 yuan, 180-pound double-weight tinplate was priced at 27 yuan and 28 yuan, and 200-pound tinplate was priced at 29 yuan and 33 yuan and 5 jiao. Yesterday, only one or two hundred boxes were sold.</p>
<p>Large Lead Bars: The military factories, paint companies, and lead oxide factories, which are the actual consumers, were all waiting and watching. The inside situation was extremely weak. The asking price was around 14 yuan per dan, but cash and large-volume transactions could be obtained for 13 yuan and 7 or 8 jiao. It was heard that only 40 to 50 bars were traded yesterday.</p>
<p>White Lead Sheets: The tea gangs had already placed orders, and battery factories had a slight demand, so the actual transaction price was more than one yuan lower than the asking price. Yesterday, more than ten barrels were sold, sold by iron merchants in the North Suzhou Road area.</p>

<p>The lychee harvest in Haikou this year was very poor, so the new goods were delayed. Yesterday, it was heard that the Taigu Company's Yuezhou ship had imported the first batch of goods, hundreds of pieces. However, it is still difficult to determine whether it is completely new goods because the samples have not been seen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to the surge in the arrival of Zhenmei green tea from various roads and villages, the market situation was quite lively. European firms had a lot of demand for goods from Wuyuan, Tunxi, Shexian, and other roads. High-quality core-extracted goods from Wuyuan opened at 120 yuan, and the situation continued to be strong. However, due to the large number of arrivals, foreign firms were busy selecting, and Chinese tea merchants also raised their prices for existing inventory due to the recent active trading. Therefore, trading was not as active as the previous day. Judging from the current situation, the market is still stable.</p>

<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>"How much is a person worth?" This question is difficult to answer correctly. For example, someone who has done great things in a spectacular way and made great contributions and benefits to society and humanity, is difficult to calculate. Someone who is mediocre and does nothing, who cannot benefit humanity in life and has no impact on society in death, is worthless, impossible to calculate. If we estimate the value of a person by how much money they can earn, then an inventor who has spent a lot of effort inventing something that benefits humanity will get far less money than a popular celebrity who sings a few songs and dances a few times. This valuation is still incorrect. If you want to value it correctly, you must use chemical analysis. Using chemical analysis to analyze the human body, the result is very accurate and fair. Because everyone, regardless of rich, poor, noble, humble, intelligent, stupid, good, or evil, is the same.</p>
<p>According to a report by Dr. Lawson of England, the average value of a human body is five shillings (approximately 2 yuan, 6 jiao, and 5 fen in Chinese currency). This is because the human body contains enough water to fill a ten-gallon bucket, enough fat to make seven long bars of soap, enough lead to make nine thousand pencils, enough phosphorus to make two thousand two hundred match heads, enough magnesium to make one dose of salt, enough iron to make a medium-sized nail, enough lime to whitewash a chicken coop, and enough sulfur to remove fleas from a dog.</p>

<p>The weather is getting hotter every day. Hot, hot, hot. Electric fans, soda, ice cream - nothing can get rid of the threat of heat. Lying down, sweat still oozes out like it does on a damp cement floor, damp and sticky, uncomfortably.</p>
<p>But don't panic! I'll tell you, there are good places to go. In this city, there are swimming pools, and, well, beaches.</p>
<p>Although I am not a pampered son from an ivory tower, since I grew up in the countryside from childhood, and when I was about ten years old, I followed my brother, carrying wooden doors, and playing in the small river. Therefore, even though I have drifted into the city now, somehow when I mention swimming, I will be happy from the bottom of my heart. It is especially because of the cramped living conditions that I feel more need for this pastime.</p>
<p>Therefore, every summer, I almost always have to rush to Hongkou Park to swim whenever I have free time. In recent years, in our company, during the hottest two or three weeks, we work in the morning and rest in the afternoon. So I use this free time to imitate the Yangzhou people's "afternoon water bathing," soaking myself in the swimming pool.</p>
<p>Since last year, I have often taken the city ferry, crossed the river, and gone to the Gaoqiao beach. The reason is that the Gaoqiao beach is not only spacious and has soft sand, but what makes me linger is the gentle and very cool sea breeze blowing from the Pacific Ocean. What's more, when the sun, which can blister people's skin, is swallowed by the city, I climb out of the sea onto the beach, stretch out my limbs, and lie down, welcoming the evening breeze. At that time, not only do I feel unlimited ease, but I simply forget that this is in a summer with a temperature of over ninety degrees.</p>
<p>Although life is so unfortunate, fortunately, there are places to swim, so I can survive such a long, hot summer. Otherwise, well, who knows, I might have been driven crazy by that long, hot summer.</p>

<p>— Yan Bokuang</p>
<p>On the hill, there is a stretch of lush green grass, abundantly spread on the warm yellow mud. On this grass is a small house surrounded by red and white striped curtains. Behind the house is a cluster of green bamboo. The weak light of the setting sun shines through the sparse gaps in the bamboo leaves onto the delightful face of the heavenly maiden. Two dark eyes glance at the four men with different expressions and smiles on their faces. A long pine bench holds a jar of oily rotten bamboo shoots, several packs of delicious beef, and Wujiapi wine is poured into the stomach like boiling water. A jar of honey-soaked lychees, she slowly sips the sweet juice.</p>
<p>The cause of this kind of enjoyment is less about admiring the green bamboo and more about using alcohol to numb the pain, right? But what kind of taste will they feel after they wake up from the alcohol?</p>
<p>After the wine and dishes are finished, several drunkards all propose to leave this beautiful hill. No, the hill is not beautiful, the beauty is still on the girl. On the way back, they talked about the emotions of longing after last night's farewell. She and I were walking side by side, passing by a long riverside, a small stone bridge, a high mound, and a narrow ridge. The girl was wearing a long blue dress mixed with azuki bean-colored flowers. The embroidered shoes under the beige stockings aroused - surprise - frequent glances. When I return to Shanghai later, I will tell you about a fun place to live.</p>
<p>The girl's movements, posture, and beautiful Shanghai language are constantly floating in the minds of the four men. The most valuable rendezvous on the hill is a scene in the history of life worth remembering forever.</p>

<p>But even though Her Old Ladyship said that, she picked up the jade bowl and drank the medicinal juice mouthful by mouthful. Of course, she was very reluctant in her heart, wishing she could throw it away and not drink it, but she couldn't be too unreasonable. The four old imperial physicians were summoned at her own discretion, and the fifth prescription was chosen at her own discretion. Now that the four imperial physicians had solemnly brewed the medicine for her, how could she not drink it? The four imperial physicians kept their heads lowered and knelt down. Only after the Empress Dowager finished drinking the medicine did she order them to leave. I think at this time they must have been as happy as if they had been relieved of a thousand pounds. Because in the palace, no one wants to stay for long. Being able to retreat earlier is really a wonderful thing that is sought after.</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager had taken her medicine, the imperial physicians had withdrawn, and the air in the palace seemed to have calmed down a bit. Everyone hoped that no more changes would occur. But unexpectedly, I caused an accident... This is all because I didn't have a thorough understanding of all the etiquette in the palace. Similar things like this had happened once before, but that time it happened to happen when I was alone with the Empress Dowager. It was not noticed by others, so it was not noticed by myself, so I committed this second time... (363)!</p>
<p>...The Empress Dowager finally picked up the jade bowl and drank the medicinal juice...</p>

<p>Yesterday, you were interred, and relatives and friends all came to mourn. Only I was busy with wedding preparations, and Lanling looked wistfully into the distance. Last night I dreamed that you came to say goodbye, leaning on the bed, sitting, talking, and laughing. Holding your hand, I felt it was still warm, but your appearance was very withered. An old woman sat to your left, and her appearance was very similar to yours. Her white hair was full of her head, but her red face was so bright. She said she was your grandmother, and a secluded residence was being built. A pot of soup and medicine was placed on the table, and the steam surrounded it like clouds. Suddenly, I remembered that your illness was critical, and who would take care of everything. I was comforting you, holding back tears, when I woke up and the sky was not yet dawn. Alas, Xie Yucen, your clear posture was always outstanding. Why didn't Heaven bless you? Your talent was abundant, but your life was short. Your poetry and prose were famous early on, and your calligraphy and painting followed Ni Zhao. In your spare time, you enjoyed epigraphy, and your appraisal was also excellent. For ten years, I have been lucky enough to be a close friend, and we have studied and discussed academics with each other. I think of me as a guest in Shanghai, poor and worried, and people easily grow old. I carve seals to support myself, and I cannot avoid the slander of the world. I am grateful that you alone saw my good points, and you always spoke kindly to me. When you were bedridden, you repeatedly informed me by mail, saying that seal carvers are mostly long-lived, and told me one by one. You bought stones and asked me to engrave and send them, but your heroic spirit has already disappeared. When I unfold the letter, the ink is still fresh, and I shed tears in vain.</p>

<p>He said: Director Gao grew up in the South, like us Southerners. He speaks very politely and doesn't flaunt his official status. No matter what kind of person with status, before you meet him, it seems very difficult to meet him. But after you meet him, you will know that you were previously nervous. Naturally, because of this nervousness, you will make mistakes. Another person interrupted: It seems that the result of your visit today is very good, and there must be something to be announced. Zhang Jiefu replied with a smile: Before the official document is sent, I dare not say this. However, Director Gao showed me very good favor. When I got up to say goodbye, he even escorted me to the door of the room and nodded to me twice. It is very difficult for people who ask for favors to get a high-ranking official to look at them twice. He was so polite to me, naturally he meant to welcome me. I think he will give me a position, no matter how small. Zhiqian can't interfere with him if he doesn't speak, so he had to get out of bed. A thought turned in his mind: Even if I can't save that girl, I'll go to the front yard to see what's going on with him. That won't hurt. So he didn't even wash his face and walked to the front yard. Looking at the watch on his hand, it was only eight o'clock. Then, at this time when Jia Duocai is complacent, he probably hasn't gotten up yet. It may not be possible to see any signs of them at this time. However, the teahouses like to chat about the actions of the guests.

<h3 id="e194">Octogenarian Great-Grandmother Receives Bachelor of Arts Degree <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Special</p>
<p>On June 8th, at the commencement ceremony of Claremont Colleges in Los Angeles, USA, among the graduating students who were mostly handsome young men, there was also a petite old lady with a height of five feet and a kind smile. She was Mrs. Guist, an octogenarian who was already a great-grandmother. Sixty years ago, she had already graduated from Illinois Woman's College (now renamed McKendree University) and obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree for women. At that time, universities generally did not award bachelor's degrees to women, but now that men and women are equal, she was able to receive a Bachelor of Arts degree at this graduation ceremony. When she bowed to President Blaisdell to receive her diploma, her blue eyes sparkled, causing people to laugh. Three of her eight children attended the ceremony. Later, she said to others, "I don't want my children to be ashamed of me. Three of my sons have already received degrees. I don't like to hear them say, 'Mother is very capable, she can bake very good cookies, but...' you understand." "But I can also cook." During her year of study at Claremont Colleges, she wrote a 28,000-word thesis titled "Lucretius: A Naturalist Poet." This paper was based on six research areas: two in the history of philosophy and the other four in Greek archeology, Roman history, Roman literature, and Latin. She proudly told people that she had never missed a day of school throughout the year. She lived in a small room in the Saycamore Lodge, which was simply furnished, like many other female students. The only difference was that they all had pictures of many boyfriends hanging up, while she had pictures of her children, grandchildren, and great-grandchildren, both male and female. She once said to her classmates, "These young people can remember things after reading them two or three times, but I am old and must work twice as hard to remember. I study for at least five hours every day, and up to eight hours." She also said, "Once I have decided to do something, I will naturally be satisfied when I succeed, but my pursuit of knowledge is only to prevent my children from running ahead of their mother. I have wanted this degree for many years, and it is only now that I have obtained it." Mrs. Guist was born in Ashtabula, Ohio, USA, on November 15, 1854. In 1876, she married Reverend Guist, a professor of English at the West Virginia Normal School in Fairmont. The couple lived in Fairmont for thirty-five years. In 1908 and 1909, leaving only two sons at home, Mrs. Guist pursued literary research and later obtained a Bachelor of Arts degree from Cornell (Iowa) University's Board of Trustees. After Mr. Guist passed away in 1932, Mrs. Guist traveled to California, Hawaii, Florida, and other places. She had eleven children, eight of whom are still alive. This old lady's tireless pursuit of knowledge is truly rare in the world.</p>

<h3 id="e195">The Development Process of a Novel <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>Anyone with creative experience probably knows that before starting a piece of work, one must go through a painstaking process of thinking: how to depict the personality of the characters in the work, how to arrange the background, how the story develops... only when the work has been fully arranged in the author's mind, can they begin to write. Writing in this way, at least the author can get some degree of satisfaction. As for the impact on readers and society, that is of course not something the author can calculate. This depends on the author's understanding and grasp of social reality. But for the author to accurately grasp and understand social reality, that is not within the scope of creation; it belongs to the author's personal life. Let's leave that aside for now.</p>
<p>But sometimes, even though the author has arranged everything properly, once they start writing, they completely or partially overturn the original plan; even the opposite result comes about. Even the author themselves cannot predict it and has to let the writing run wild. I think anyone with creative experience must have experienced this. The best example is a passage of self-confession in Fadeyev's creative experience; he said:</p>
<p>"When I was writing *The Rout*, for the first time I encountered that many of the things I had conceived before were not incorporated into the work. I encountered new elements that emerged in the work process that I had never thought of before. For example, according to my original plan, Mechik was going to commit suicide in the end, but when I started writing this character, I gradually became convinced that he could not end in suicide, nor should he."</p>
<p>"After drafting the outline of the protagonist's behavior, psychology, appearance, expression, etc., as the novel develops, this or that protagonist seems to correct the original design themselves, and there seems to be a logic of their own in the development of the characters. To give an example: it is one thing for Mechik to live in a military hospital and in the forest; it is another thing for him to join the team after he gets better. I tried to imagine how he would act in the new situation, and therefore I got another result. The protagonist of the work, if the artist knows him well, leads himself to some extent."</p>
<p>This passage is truly insightful. Those who have never tasted the joys and hardships of creation cannot say such a thorough thing. But we cannot completely say it as mysteriously as Fadeyev, saying that when the novel develops to a certain stage, the characters in the novel can lead the author to go in the direction of his own suitable voice and appearance. In fact, this is all related to the author's own consciousness. Taking Mechik in *The Rout* as an example. The author originally planned for him to end in suicide. Of course, Mechik did not want to be given a positive evaluation in the author's conception, so he used suicide to deny the value of his actions. But when the novel developed to a certain stage, the author's correct consciousness, in constant self-examination, felt that ending Mechik with suicide would instead make him feel somewhat lovable. So let him escape. Once Mechik escaped, the rogue nature of Moroska increased in value on the other hand; and all the characters in *The Rout* were even more powerful. On the surface, it seems that the protagonist in the work is indeed leading the author. In essence, it is still the author's correct consciousness that leads himself. In other words, the author discovered, from the premise of using suicide to deny the value of Mechik's actions, that this negation of suicide was not powerful; and might even cause readers to sympathize with the suicide victim; therefore, he more powerfully used escape to deny the value of Mechik's actions. But the author's essential plan to give Mechik a negative evaluation was still not changed.</p>
<p>Early Chinese New Literature authors often used the word "inspiration" as the only proper attitude for creators. Therefore, most of the novels at that time were in the form of essays. There was no need to pre-arrange any development process for a work. They mostly said that their articles came "from shaking the pen" and "were completed in one stroke." Undoubtedly, this creative attitude has long been negated. If an author is still so proud now, it is not showing the development of his creative genius, but confessing his egoistic indulgence. Then came an opposite advocacy, which was the so-called content issue of the work, making the works of that period dry and tasteless. Now, of course, many authors have corrected this incorrect tendency. But some people also argue that the work does not necessarily have to pay attention to its development process. This seems to be open to discussion.</p>
<p>To continue writing down a realistic prototype of a section, there should also be a vague organic connection in each fragment; but in my opinion, this kind of novel only achieves the first step of displaying the material. Just as when we read some novels by certain writers, we often think of pieces of bloody meat on a meat pillow. There is naturally some partial realism in its expression. However, it is definitely not vivid. This is, of course, a subjective choice made by the author; but without consciously giving it an organic connection. In other words, this kind of technique by the author ignores the causal pursuit of each phenomenon.</p>
<p>Every novel does not necessarily have to have a complete story. Every work must pay attention to its development process. And this development process must not be scattered piece by piece without connection. In its development process, it is necessary to pay attention to its causality and give it a positive or negative evaluation.</p>
<h3 id="e196">China's Goddess of the Sun and Moon <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Yao Xueyin</p>
<p>Greece and Northern Europe both have beautiful myths. China also went through a primitive era, and probably had them originally, but unfortunately most of the myths were lost later.</p>
<p>Yi shooting the ten suns is one of the surviving beautiful myths, but it is not very complete. I have previously collected all the materials about this story from books such as "Heavenly Questions," "Li Sao," "Classic of Mountains and Seas," "Huainanzi," and "Zuo Zhuan" to conduct a comparative study, and as a result, I unintentionally discovered the goddess who gave birth to the sun and moon. And what is interesting is that the goddesses who gave birth to the sun and moon were originally twin sisters, the well-known Ehuang and Nuying.</p>
<p>In ancient times, according to Guo Moruo's "Research on Oracle Bone Characters," the myth of the ten suns was produced among the Xia and Shang peoples who had some knowledge of farming. Originally, barbarians saw the sun rising and falling, and thought that the sunset was the sun's rest, and that the one that came out from the east the next day was the second one. This speculation is very reasonable. They guessed that the sun had ten brothers, who took turns in charge of the daytime; later, the ten brothers came out together, scorching the crops, plants, people, and animals to death, so God "gave Yi a red bow and white arrows" to shoot and kill nine of the suns. This God was Emperor Yao in the Xia nation and Emperor Shun in the Shang nation. Ancient books record places where there were multiple suns in the sky, such as:</p>
<p>"There is a Fusang tree in Tanggu (i.e., Yanggu), one sun arrives and one sun comes out, all carried by crows." (Classic of the Great Wilderness: East)</p>
<p>"There is a Fusang tree in Tanggu, where the ten suns come out. It is north of the Black Teeth, located in the water, with a large tree, nine suns residing on the lower branches, and one sun residing on the upper branch." (Classic of Lands Within the Seas: East) "The Ruo tree is west of the Jian tree, and at the end are ten suns, whose brilliance illuminates the ground below." (Huainanzi: Topographical Instructions)</p>
<p>"When King Wu attacked Zhou... when fighting, the ten suns were in chaos above." (Ibid: Military Strategies)</p>
<p>"In the eighth year of Emperor Lian, there was a monster, and the ten suns came out together." (Bamboo Annals) "The ten suns come out in turn, melting gold and scorching stones." (Summoning Souls)</p>
<p>In addition, in the twenty-ninth year of Jie, two suns came out together, see "Bamboo Annals" and "Weft of the Classic of Filial Piety"; in the fifth year of Jianxing of Emperor Min of Jin, three suns shone together; "Book of Tang: Turkic Biography": five suns came out together, illuminating for three months in a row. However, the myth of ten suns in the sky is the oldest and most widely known.</p>
<p>Regarding the birth of the ten suns, the "Classic of the Great Wilderness: South" says:</p>
<p>"Outside the East Sea, between the sweet waters, is the country of Xihe; there is a woman named Xihe, who bathes the sun in the sweet abyss. Xihe is the wife of Emperor Jun, and she gives birth to the ten suns."</p>
<p>According to recent research: Emperor Jun is Emperor Yan, that is, Emperor Shun. Shun's wives are traditionally Ehuang and Nuying. "Xi" is pronounced "E" in ancient times, and "Huang" and "He" have the same sound, so Xihe should be Ehuang. Therefore, the "Classic of the Great Wilderness: South" also has the saying "Emperor Jun's wife Ehuang gave birth to this country of three bodies." Therefore, I think it would not be a mistake to say that the goddess who gave birth to the ten suns is Ehuang. As for recognizing Nuying as the goddess who gave birth to the moon, the evidence is as follows:</p>
<p>"Emperor Jun's wife Changxi gave birth to twelve moons." (Classic of the Great Wilderness: West)</p>
<p>"Emperor Ku's second concubine married a woman of the Zi clan named Changyi." (Chronicles of Emperors and Kings)</p>
<p>Changxi is the same as Changyi, which is Chang'e. Yu is Shun, and Shun's second concubine is Nuying, so Nuying is Changyi, later written as "Chang'e" or "Heng'e." "Classic of Lands Within the Seas: North" says: "Shun's wife Dengbi gave birth to Xiaoming Zhuguang, living in the great swamp of the river. The spirits of the two daughters can illuminate a hundred li in this direction." This is a trace of the two concubines giving birth to the sun and moon. Probably the name Nuying came later. In the original legend, Shun's two concubines were not Ehuang and Nuying, but Xihe and Changyi. Later, the myth was historicized, and Xihe and Ehuang were split into two people, the former becoming the sun driver; and also split into the Xi clan and the He clan, as Yao's two ministers. Nuying ran out for no reason, squeezing Chang'e out of Shun's side and turning her into the wife of Yi who stole the elixir and fled to the moon. The story of Chang'e fleeing to the moon is related to the alchemists of the Qin and Han dynasties and is very clear.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Raffles Place <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Fei Er</p>
<p>Singapore Impression Notes III</p>
<p>Every day, Raffles Place is neatly lined with many modern cars, and the tall buildings on both sides constitute the heart of the entire Nanyang region. Foreign money constantly flows in and out from here, and the entire Nanyang colony is tightly held in the pens of high-ranking officials.</p>
<p>In the morning and evening, cars and trams are filled with people coming and going. Newspaper vendors shout at the top of their lungs, and foreign language newspapers are discarded on desks or held under arms.</p>
<p>At noon, as soon as the banks and foreign firms close, the Indian bosses stick out their big bellies and direct their black employees to greet customers in their coffee shops. As a result, the coffee shops are immediately filled with many races: white, yellow, black, and brown. At the same time, the coffee shops are filled with the smoke of hot food, cold drinks, and cigarettes. Malay and Malay-style English, occasionally mixed with a bit of Indian and Chinese, flow out in a torrent, turning the entire coffee shop into a cacophony.</p>
<p>Choosing a quiet corner of the coffee shop and quietly observing the faces of these various people from all over the world (regrettably, the red race is missing), seeing how each character that constitutes Nanyang's "Wall Street" uses a posture to express that they are a small piece of the capitalist machine, is quite interesting.</p>
<p>Until the dark night, Raffles Place is left with only a sense of calmness and desolation. The banks and foreign firms have tightly closed their iron doors, the bookstores selling popular English and American magazines only display the covers of various interesting books in the windows; the Chinese pupils who supply the daily necessities of the foreign firm employees have stopped shouting and selling their goods, and stacks of invoices have also been put away. The Indian gatekeepers snore on their cots, while the "matas" (Malay policemen) lonely tread their weary steps, and the moon casts cold silver light from the tall corners of the walls. Raffles Place is like a desolate castle surrounded by cement. When calm, Raffles Place is deserted, and only the sea tide near the coast stirs up the roar of the waves in the late night.</p>
<p>The daytime noise and the nighttime silence are the regular contractions of the heart of Singapore. When the foreign firm employees also curse their "London homeland," and when the tide of recession also sweeps into Raffles Place and causes them to lose their jobs or have their salaries reduced, Raffles Place suffers from anemia again. Then, Raffles Place will gradually fade its intense color, and the special impression it leaves on people will gradually diminish.</p>

<p>— Written by Storm of Germany, Translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>I was in a state of confusion when suddenly I heard the little girl say a low "Good night!" Then I saw her disappear into the shadow of the portico. I heard the sound of the door carefully opening and the faint sound of the doorbell. Then I turned around and slowly walked home through the mansion's garden.</p>
<p>I didn't go to my parents' living room for dinner, but sneaked upstairs to my room. I lay on the mattress as if drunk. After a quarter of an hour, I heard the door move; from the half-closed seam of my eyes, I saw my mother approaching my bed with a lamp. She bent down towards me, but I closed my eyes tightly and continued to dream. Although she didn't give me much hope when we parted tonight, I felt as if my hand had already grasped a rose-colored ribbon and was walking towards a happy future.</p>
<p>I wanted to think silently alone that night, and the next morning I wanted to run into the crowd. I had a new feeling of freedom and victory, and now I wanted to perceive this feeling in front of others. After I finished breakfast and reluctantly answered a few troublesome questions from my mother, I went to my friend Christopher's workshop. He was intently selecting small pieces of mahogany wood to carve. "What are you making something good?" I asked.</p>
<p>"A sewing box," he said, without looking up.</p>
<p>"A sewing box? For whom?"</p>
<p>"For Lena Se. Borica's; my sister wants to give it to her as a birthday gift."</p>
<p>I watched him from the side; a smug smile appeared on my face. "Is Lena your sweetheart, Christopher?"</p>
<p>This good young man blushed with shame at my presumptuous question. He seemed angry at his own embarrassment. "You guys should let her out of your Latin dance school!" he said, angrily splitting the wood with his knife.</p>
<p>"Are you really jealous like this, Christopher?" I asked.</p>
<p>But he didn't answer; he just muttered to himself, "If it were my sister, then..."</p>
<p>But this time, the matter was only my one and only time of success, because no matter how I tried to find ways, I never had the chance to be alone with Lena. During the summer, she met me several times on Sunday afternoons on the sidewalk behind the garden, but Christopher and his sister accompanied her. This good young man walked proudly next to her, as if he wanted to fight the "Latins" for her; she herself seemed to urge them to move forward and not talk to me when I went to talk to them.</p>

<h3 id="e200">Crossing the Yellow River at Night <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Qi Wuwen</p>
<p>In this short period, I ran to many small places and crossed the Yellow River twice. It was simply not a journey, but a gallop, a transfer. Only the white clouds in the west wind were more elusive than me!</p>
<p>That's right, life is always on the road, and I am even more on the road within the road.</p>
<p>One night, I took the Pinghan train south, and when I arrived at the north bank of the Yellow River, I ran out of the carriage to the place where people were getting on and off, leaned on the iron railing, and waited to personally experience the night scene of the Yellow River.</p>
<p>A long and sharp whistle swept through the wind, and the huge Yellow River iron bridge was in front of me; followed by the heavy metallic sound of the wheels and rails rubbing, adding a bit of emptiness and slow meaning. What I saw first was a vast expanse of shallow yellow and grayish sand, and even after more than thirty sections of the bridge, there was only sand under the bridge. The moon could not be seen in the gray sky, and the sparse stars were covered by a curtain woven of fine sand, appearing and disappearing in the northwest wind. Under such a sky, the beach spread out silently like a soft Dead Sea, and the lights of the iron bridge illuminated the heavy and orderly shadow of the iron bridge, and the heavy shadow of a row of trains, pressing down on this sea.</p>
<p>Finally, I saw the river itself. The water seemed not deep, and its turbid yellow color could still be distinguished under the light! A color a little more yellow than the sand. The wind seemed a little tighter than before, and the machine's voice could not cover the rhythmic sound of the river water splashing against the shore. The closer to the center of the river, the faster the water flowed, and white eddies surged. The river was empty, only in the distance where the river and the starry sky were about to meet, a jagged dark shadow was lit up. From that slender, towering pole-shaped object, I recognized it as a boat. In such a dark night, in such a classical river, such an ancient boat was parked alone. "Is it an eerie dream?" I couldn't help but be led into fantasy by this picture full of melancholy suggestion. I remembered that I had vaguely had many dreams similar to this picture. Sometimes I felt that it was the dark shadow of "fate," and sometimes I felt that it was a symbol of "despair." After waking up, I often felt an inexplicable terror. And now I was actually in this similar realistic realm—and precisely in the windy storehouse of the vast future ahead, how my subconscious mind was throbbing at that time!</p>
<p>The Yellow River was crossed in a short while, followed by another vast beach. I didn't return to the carriage until the iron bridge was over. I felt a little chilly and rubbed my cheeks, which were also icy cold. It turned out that I had been standing in the wind for almost half an hour.</p>
<p>"Knowing that this time will definitely be crossed again, what about the hundred feelings before Zunqian? It is also something that has never happened in this life, crossing the Yellow River with a chest full of clear tears!" Isn't this one of the miscellaneous poems of Gong Ding'an Guihai (1833)? I first read Gong Ding'an's poems because of a friend's strong recommendation. That friend once asked me what I liked to read most. I remember that this poem was what I especially liked at that time. I loved its white depiction, I was moved by its twists and turns, but I always felt that its sadness was a bit exaggerated. I never thought that I would actually be in the realm of the poem, and the sadness seemed to be equally exaggerated. This accidental coincidence is worth my reflection.</p>

<h3 id="e201">Italian Reporter Demands Duel with British Member of Parliament <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Meng Ruo</p>
<p>Among the current group of self-proclaimed civilized people, many barbaric customs are still often left over. For example, dueling is one example. Dueling often arises from love disputes between men and women or disputes over certain events. The methods of dueling are sometimes sword fighting and sometimes gun fighting. When dueling, in addition to the two duelists, it is also necessary to invite a second to witness the event. This kind of behavior, as we see it, is barbaric, but they say it is civilized, because the duel is voluntary on both sides and there are rules of dueling to be followed. In reality, this may be a little more civilized than assassination.</p>
<p>According to recent news from London, an Italian Fascist newspaper reporter, Captain Faurelli, claims that he is willing to duel with Major Attlee, the deputy leader of the British House of Commons. Faurelli said that he is willing to compete with Attlee in a neutral country with any weapon, because he objected to Attlee's recent reservations during the debate on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute in the British House of Commons, so he has this determination. It is said that Attlee has refused, saying that dueling is a barbaric and evil custom for resolving disputes, and he does not deign to do so, but Faurelli is still dissatisfied and is determined to do it.</p>
<p>The feelings between Britain and Italy were not bad, but recently, because of the dispute over the Italian-Abyssinian issue, a rift has occurred between the two countries. Initially, the ruling leaders of both sides issued tit-for-tat remarks, accusing each other. Later, public opinion also followed, attacking each other with harsh words. Unexpectedly, now there is an Italian newspaper reporter who claims to want to duel with a British major. This is also an aspect of the deterioration of relations between Britain and Italy.</p>
<p>Objectively speaking, Faurelli's desire to duel with Attlee stems from patriotic ideology, rather than from personal grudges. However, this kind of behavior is too extreme. Attlee's refusal is not a sign of weakness; he simply does not deign to do so. It is said that when Attlee met with a Reuters reporter to talk about this matter, he said that Italy has no freedom of speech today, so Faurelli does not know what is permissible during debates in the British Parliament. I wonder what Faurelli thinks of this remark?</p>
<h3 id="e202">Flute Sound <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>The moonlight of summer nights is like pure white milk, like a gentle and quiet virgin, pouring into my lonely window; every day my weak body is worn down by heavy work, and on moonlit nights, I greedily yearn for her tenderness and tranquility, turning off the electricity and lamps, and smoking a light cigarette by the window. The light summer breeze, like a mother's love, caresses my face, and I stare blankly as the wisps of smoke float upwards, feeling as if I am dissolving into this harmonious and peaceful environment, completely without thought, often forgetting the time for sleep.</p>
<p>For a week now, the light breeze of each night has carried a mournful flute sound. Although I don't understand music, I like it, but that weeping flute sound stirs up endless sorrow in me!</p>
<p>Every night I listen intently, trying to discern its direction. The suburbs are so quiet, and the residents all sleep early, except for the croaking of frogs, and the flute sound of that unknown person; but even if I listen with all my ears, I can't tell which direction it's coming from. For days now, my mood has been disturbed, and I haven't had a moment of peace. I go to bed late every day, almost doing so just to listen to his flute sound.</p>
<p>— Does that unknown person have unspeakable hidden sorrows? Or perhaps he's stirred up a deep homesickness? On this moonlit and breezy night, he pours out his sorrows through the flute. But has he ever considered that there is someone like me (and perhaps more sympathizers) whose painful memories are evoked by his flute sound? I've also thought that he might be a free-spirited poet, searching his barren mind for a poem on such a beautiful moonlit night. Unable to find a satisfactory work, he uses the flute to inspire his poetic mood, but why doesn't he play a happy tune? One should be optimistic in life!</p>
<p>But tonight, as I think of him, the flute sound I expected doesn't come. I also sensitively think that perhaps he's gone mad; or perhaps he's wandered off to another unfamiliar place, but I don't want my ideal to be like that; I'd rather hear his low, mournful flute sound again tomorrow night!</p>
<p>Then, a pale face flashed before me; it was a classmate from middle school, whom I met through playing the flute.</p>
<p>— One holiday evening, I went to bed early. But I was surrounded by a strange feeling of being attacked, preventing me from falling asleep immediately. That was the first time I heard the flute sound. It was a classmate from next door, playing his phoenix flute, and I couldn't sleep because of the low, mournful sound, so I banged loudly on the wall, signaling him to stop that wretched thing.</p>
<p>But unexpectedly, he shouted, "Friend, come over and sit for a while."</p>
<p>As if receiving an order from a superior, my anger completely dissipated. I put on my bathrobe and involuntarily went to knock on his door. The person who opened the door was a young classmate whom I saw every day but had never greeted. From what the other classmates said, he was very aloof; even those in the same dormitory rarely saw him smile. He was always alone. But today, I found a trace of warm smile on his thin face, and he warmly shook my hand, but his hand was cold.</p>
<p>— I'm sorry we've never spoken before. Why aren't you going home on the holiday?</p>
<p>— Go back to where?</p>
<p>— You don't have a home? That's just as pitiful!</p>
<p>Spurred by sympathy, we became friends at first sight. We became very close friends. For the last few years, we lived in the same dormitory, although my friends warned me that it was dangerous for me to get close to such an eccentric person.</p>
<p>But we graduated safely. On the night of our farewell, we shook hands earnestly and parted ways. The days have passed so quickly, and it's been five long years now, but I haven't heard any news of him or received a single word from him.</p>
<p>Why has tonight's flute sound suddenly stopped? He might be that lonely friend of mine. Even if it's someone I'll never know, I still hope that he's not as unfortunate as I imagine!</p>

<h3 id="e203">Dream <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>— Liang Qijun</p>
<p>I like dreams.</p>
<p>I believe that anyone who is imprisoned by the shackles of reality will say that they like dreams.</p>
<p>Dreams can give people comfort; although this comfort is temporary, and it disappears like a flash in the pan. But if you dream of something you've been pursuing day and night without success, how happy would you feel! At least, you'd be able to crack a smile in an extremely gloomy atmosphere. However, afterwards, perhaps due to excessive joy, you'd feel a slight disappointment, and you'd say:</p>
<p>— Ah, it's a pity it was just a dream!</p>
<p>The beauty of dreams is extremely beautiful, so peaceful and light. It's like in spring, in that increasingly warm season, the falling petals of blooming, vibrant peach blossoms landing on the still stream, causing slight ripples, gently caressed by the spring breeze, slowly spreading out in all directions. And then, gradually, disappearing at some unknown time and place.</p>
<p>I don't remember which translated work said in the translator's preface that Russians are the best at dreaming. So, I read that book again and again, and I don't know if it was influenced by it? I love to dream now.</p>
<p>Dreams are close to fantasy. Because I often yearn for the loveliness of places like the Caucasus, Spain, or Hawaii. So, after reading novels or watching movies about these places, some fantasies arise——.</p>
<p>"A southern tropical island, a bright moon hanging in the pale ink-colored sky, coconut trees casting huge, beautiful black shadows intertwined on the grass, lying alone under a [blank space] tree, quietly listening to the natives playing passionate and provocative music with a primitive flavor,..."</p>
<p>"Or in an antique castle town, listening to Spanish-style tunes, men, bullfighting gladiators, women, wearing unique dresses, beautiful and melancholy faces with a hint of a slight smile,..."</p>
<p>That night, perhaps, dreams about these things will quietly come.</p>

<h3 id="e204">Watching the Rain <a href="#e204" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c204" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">204</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Xi</p>
<p>Of all the rain I've seen in my life, the most interesting to watch has been in these three situations: on a steamship, on a train, and when I was a child at the doorway of my home. It seems that the scenes of childhood are always worth cherishing, but many of them don't mean much when I think about them now. Maybe it's because my mood has changed; the feeling of watching the rain at my doorway is gone now. Maybe it's because my family's circumstances are too bad to allow a grown-up to act like a child at the doorway anymore. So, this kind of rain-watching can now only be savored in memory, but there's not much real interest in it anymore.</p>
<p>As for watching the rain on a steamship or a train, that's for grown-ups. Being able to see a rain shower amidst the hardships of travel can really bring a sense of warmth to a traveler. In many places, it can even evoke a traveler's loneliness, but that loneliness is sweet, moist: at least, that's how it is for me. I've never tasted the flavor of "Clear and Bright Festival, rain drizzling," so I don't know. But from the perspective of the time, those travelers on the road are really in a poem: following the shepherd boy's hand, watching the apricot flowers in the rain from afar, that misty scene, one would say they were drunk rather than heartbroken; even if they were drunk with loneliness, it's also sweet, [blank space]. If this were on a boat or train, one [blank space] could be lonely enough to fall asleep, which is much better than listening to the dry [blank space] crashing sound, which is much more boring. Much sweeter. When [blank space] is boring, a thin [blank space] is a sleeping pill [blank space] [blank space] [blank space] can be [blank space] that is [blank space] , one can wash away boredom. Falling asleep while watching the rain is an admirable thing. When I was a child, sitting at the doorway of my home, swinging my legs, humming an unknown song, watching the wind carry the rain drifting past the coconut leaves, drifting past the misty fields, I would often lean against the wall and fall asleep; although I don't have that opportunity now, nor that mood, it's still sweet and moist to think about. This kind of rain-watching is now only a memory! The real enjoyment of watching the rain is on steamships and trains.</p>
<p>Watching the rain on a steamship always feels a bit like a lonely boat being battered by the rain, so just saying "watching" doesn't seem to be enough; one has to listen too. Watching is good, the mistiness of the sea can really make someone who gets lost in it jump down; and listening is even more interesting. It's rhythmic, the mechanical sound of the ship traveling is the rhythm, very even, and most people who have been on a ship probably know this. In each rhythm, there is the sound of wind and waves, it is a very grand march, with the so-called earth-shattering momentum; yes, passengers will feel lonely in this momentum, but that rare momentum will make passengers forget themselves, forget the dryness and boredom; they will "forget their form" in loneliness. The "beauty" of the scene can pull people into the scene, which is perhaps what is called "becoming ethereal." Watching the rain can make people reach such a point.</p>
<p>Rain must be very captivating. The third-class carriage should be the most boisterous. When I say boisterous, I still mean the travelers' minds, watching the telephone poles receding one by one, who isn't calculating how far away they are from their home? Originally, going out is really a hardship, with anxious and bored minds. Looking around, there's not a single familiar face. Your own words can only be [blank space] in your own heart; a tired face showing tired thoughts. Facing each other, you just pretend to look at the scenery outside the car, and no one can guess what the person opposite is thinking. This is so boisterous, so annoying! But seeing the surroundings drooping, gloomy, this atmosphere of suffering will naturally dissolve; seeing the crops outside the window swaying, that scene of the mountain rain about to come, almost forces every passenger to say that the rain is coming. "Yes, the rain is coming!" The person opposite will also answer, and then they will start talking, and a third person will add, "Close the window!" In this way, strangers are no longer strangers. This is the effect of the rain, making the traveler's heart warm. When the conversation dies down, they turn back to watch the rain, watching the rain hitting the crops outside the window, looking at the trees in the distance, at the horizon. [blank space] passing through the village, the villagers are also taking their children to the doorway to watch the rain! Watching, watching, the heart will become blurred, and there is no time to calculate how far away from home! Leaning on each other, some are absorbed by the rain! What's left is the rhythm, the sound of the wheels grinding against the rails.</p>
<p>Watching the rain is so interesting. But it may be my sorrow that that kind of rain-watching as a child is gone. I can only taste a little flavor in my memory, and although the flavor is good, unfortunately, I'm grown up, and I don't have the mood to reminisce much anymore.</p>

<p>People call Chen Yanyan "Beautiful Little Bird" because she recently starred in "Wild Geese Descending on the Cold River," wearing a gorgeous Western classical-style dress, so people call her "Beautiful Little Women."</p>
<p>Kathleen Hepburn starred in "Little Women," and her attire was almost the same as hers. When Yanyan dresses like this, she looks even more beautiful and quiet. Precisely because of this, the photos she took in this outfit have recently been used as covers by several film magazines in Shanghai.</p>
<p>According to director Ma Xuweibang, the reason for letting Yanyan wear this kind of clothing in "Wild Geese Descending on the Cold River" is not to be innovative, but to consider the performance. As for what kind of performance effect this clothing has, we can only wait to see the film.</p>

<p>"Heroes of the Times" was filming Shang Guanwu's 50th birthday that night. Because the scene was too large and there were too many actors, only half of the eighteen shots planned were filmed. Last night, everyone was mobilized again to film the remaining nine shots.</p>
<p>The lively situation that night was the same as the previous night, but four more guests appeared among the five hundred congratulatory guests: one was a fashionable modern lady, and three were lively and innocent children. These four guest performers attracted the attention of everyone on the set. It turned out that this "modern lady" and the three children were the wife and sons of director Ying Yunwei. That night, their whole family made a cameo appearance in "Heroes of the Times." Their expressions were all natural. Cinematographer Zhou Keyou commented, "The wife and sons of a famous director are extraordinary."</p>

<p>Zhao Dan, this young man with a pretty face, his every move makes people feel good about him. His acting skills are not only very successful on the screen, but also excellent on the stage. Last time, the amateur drama club performed "Nora," and Zhao Dan played the role of Helmer in it, with truly captivating expressions, and was called an actor with "ghostly" talent by a certain director.</p>
<p>Because of his love for drama, Zhao Dan gathered his drama-loving comrades in the Mingxing studio the day before yesterday, preparing to organize a drama group, and expressed his opinions on drama, saying that drama is the only tool to transform society, so if we are determined to change society, we must start with drama. His comrades applauded enthusiastically, and Shu Xiuwen was even happier, embracing him passionately. But just as they were about to kiss, director Zhang Shichuan shouted "Cut," forbidding their actions, which was a great damper on the atmosphere, so this good thing was abandoned. Later, after asking the onlookers, it was learned that they were filming a scene in "The Big Family."</p>

<p>"Heavenly Ethics," one of Lianhua's major films this year, will be filmed on location in Wuxi in the coming days. All the important actors will be dispatched. When this trip is completed, the entire play will be completed.</p>
<p>Cai Chusheng's new script has been completed, but the title of the play has not yet been determined. Zheng Junli will dress up as an old man in this play.</p>
<p>Tang Tianxiu has a long history in the Chinese film industry. His previous works were very remarkable. His recent works are "Little Angel" and "Wild Geese Descending on the Cold River." It is said that after these two films are completed, Tang may leave the film industry. If so, "Little Angel" and "Wild Geese Descending on the Cold River" will be Tang's last works.</p>
<p>Sun Yu's wife is ill and is being treated by a famous doctor. Sun's new work, "Go to Nature," has had its model made by the set designer, and key staff and actors may be gathered in the coming days to discuss the plot and set a shooting date.</p>
<p>Lianhua recently received a slapstick script from a Ms. Lin Mengjuan, titled "Playing the Flute to Attract the Phoenix," depicting the love of a madman and showing the ability of humor and satire to the extreme. It seems to be the same flavor as Chaplin's "City Lights." If it can be made into a film, it must be starred by [blank space] Langen.</p>
