<h3 id="c22">日本禁止我國農工出關 <a href="#c22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>本月十四日起。日方突然禁止我國農工出關。消息傳來。當時欲赴東北而被阻於榆關者。數以千計。此輩進退兩難。甚致扶老携幼。露宿僻巷。頓成難民爲狀至慘。因此北寧路當局已在沿線各站。遍貼布告。勸農工勿貿然前往。免這流離。而我政府則亦着手於事實之研究。以籌應付之方法。</p>
<p>夫日本禁止我國農工出關謀生之最大原因。厥爲最近我國農工出關者漸多。足以影響日鮮人之移殖。關東軍司令南次郞前曾頒佈限制我國農工出關謀生辦法。彼其此次對我國出關農工。加以禁阻者。殆卽由於實施所頒辦法之故。</p>
<p>夷考日本之移民滿蒙。乃其實現大陸政策之一種步驟。固不自今日始。惟自其挾傀儡以統治我東北四省以來。則進行更爲積極。一九三三年一月。日方曾在關東軍特務部內。集合軍參謀部·大使館·總領事館·拓務省·朝鮮總督府·及關東廳等代表。組織移民部。主持一切移民事宜。其後又得軍部之援助。募集在鄉軍人一千二百餘名。移往松花江一帶。並在北大營·公主嶺等處。設立移民訓練所。訓練主持移民事宜之人才。一面更藉愧儡之力。擴大其在東北之士地商租權。於是至一九三四年七月。日本除在遼寧已取得之土地商租權外。復獲松花江流·域拉濱·圖寧·濱北·齊北黑河等附近區域·與哈爾濱郊外之商租權。此廣大區城之商租權獲得後。關東軍特務部乃復於十一月二十六日至十二月六日間。召集闌東軍·滿鐵·拓務省·朝鮮總督府·東亞勸業會社、三菱東山農事會社。及僞組織等代表於長春。舉行移民會議。决議組織一官民合辦之拓殖會社。其資本額定五千萬元。由日本政府擔任二千萬元。僞組織方面擔任一千萬元。其餘二千萬元則向民間募集。由是觀之。可見日本之向我東北移民。不僅早具决心且自僞組織成立以來。多方策劃進行更力。此種移民事業之積極進行。乃爲實施「兼併政策」之重要步驟。而其禁止我國農工往關外謀生。實卽推進此政策之一種手段也。</p>
<p>近時我國國民往海外謀生者。動遭排斥。如墨西哥·日本之相繼驅逐我僑胞歸國。以及最近暹羅之封閉華僑學校等。其最顯著者耳。今東北四省原爲我國領土。日本旣用武力强佔於前。又禁止我國農工前往謀生於後。能不令人深感我國人口出路日隘之痛苦。人口之有無出路。影響於國計民生。至重且大。願我政府一面積極交涉力謀補救。一面促進國內生產事業之發展。以救濟失業之農工。夫然。我「民族」「民生」前途之荊棘。庶可逐漸芟除乎。</p>

<p>銀行業同業公會各委員、如張公權·唐壽民·徐寄廎·葉扶霄·貝淞蓀·等十餘人、於昨日正午十二時、在銀行公會會議室午餐、直至下午一時許始散、新聲社記者探悉、該會每逢星期二聚餐一次、席間互談各項問題、昨午之聚餐、對於工商業信用小借欵等均談及、但未有任何决定、</p>
<p>小組會討論</p>
<p>舉辦工商業信用小借欵五百萬元案、地方協會等决定爲政府與　錢業各半認定、今錢業雖議决、毋庸加入銀團、但政府與銀行、决繼續舉辦、銀行公會所組之小組會委員爲陳光甫·唐壽民·徐寄廎·葉扶霄·貝淞蓀·王延松·等六人、今决定陳光甫今日返滬後、卽行召集開會討論如何會同政府舉辦工商業信用小借欵案、</p>
<p>王延松談話</p>
<p>新聲社記者、昨訪市商會顧問委員王延松氏於綢業銀行、詢以復興市面問題之意見、承王氏發表談話如次、目前上海市面之不景氣、可謂錯綜複雜、若農村之破產、入超之鉅大、現銀之外流、世界經濟恐慌之波及、均其主要原因、簡單言之、實深受整個國民經濟衰落之影響、故自政府以至庶民、同在困難之境地、絕鮮苦樂不均之現象、至能否打破難關、復趨繁榮、須視吾人能否從自覺自救　一德一心二語着眼爲斷、蓋處此局面、如全國各界猶交相責難、或陳義過高、不顧實際、則於事無補、反足增重恐怖、語云、「多難興邦、」吾人不應以此自餒、首須使人心趨於安定、然後以沉着之態度、刻苦之精神、自政府以至金融工商業·及一般民衆·一德一心、共謀巨額入超之减少、國際收支之平衡、使現銀不復外流、方爲根本之圖、現今市商會等所擬之治標辦法、在大體上多尚允當、但鄙意以爲仍須由各方能切實合作耳、至綢緞業所創之商業承兌匯票、乃增加流通籌碼、使同業間呆滯帳面、得以靈活之一策、亦卽以自己之力量、救濟自己之一辦法、各業如均能分別努力、通力合作、則目前僵局、未始不可逐漸打開也云云、</p>
<p>錢業有復函</p>
<p>錢業同業公會議决、錢莊業務原以信用放欵爲主、毋庸加入銀團後、同時由主席秦潤卿·向會員錢莊儘量承做、今該會己將臨時會員大會决議案、函復地方協會、又據新聲社記者探悉、錢業公會會員錢莊、總共五十七家、如每家能平均擴充工商業信用放欵五萬元、卽可使工商業在金融週轉方面、增加二百八十五萬元之助力矣、</p>

<p>中央社云、傳本埠地產商人程霖生等、爲救濟市面、於日前曾一度舉行會議、决議組織上海商業經濟協會籌備發行地產流通券五萬萬元云云、昨晨中央社記者、以此分向本埠銀行界探詢意見、大部份銀行界領袖、對此羣斥爲妄舉、無論如何、决難實現也、並伸述其不能實現之最大原因云、一班地產商人、欲籌發地產流通券五萬萬元、救濟市面之衰落、其旨可嘉、但究此五萬萬元之流通券、如何能發行、即發行後、如何能流通市上、係一重大問題、依照該會建議、流通券一如紙幣、則五萬萬元流通券之發行、需有百分之六十之現金保證、換言之、發行五萬萬元之地產流通券、必須先具有三萬萬元之現金保證方可、査得本市存銀總數、僅有三萬萬之數、故一班地產商人、欲籌此三萬萬元現金保證、雖二虎九牛之力、亦難獲成功、且地產商人持片面主張、籌發流通劵、設果如願發行、試問能得各方之諒解、互相兌換否、凡此種種、均屬重大疑問、所以對於地產商之此舉、除目爲妄舉外、別無其他意見、蓋絕對不能見諸事實也、</p>
<p>又據銀行公會方面意見、此項計劃、卽能有百分之一成就、而所能救濟者、亦屬少數地產商人、蓋使彼等之不動產、一變而成動產、在彼等固屬如魚得水、得以調劑週轉、然對整個社會、並無若何善良影響也、又謂、銀行公會對救濟市面、素主穩健、好高騖遠、實所不取、</p>

<p>「快樂」，必須從痛苦中尋找，否則，得到的也只是表面的而已；因爲沒有遼闊的大海，現不出崇高的山。　　在樂極的時候，一定會張開大嘴「哈哈……」的笑，然而實在不得已的時侯，也能顯出笑來，不過這是可怕的苦笑！</p>

<p>— 怡怡館主</p>
<p>在咱們中國的舊式家庭裏，十有九家的牆壁上，甚而至於前後門的門擋上，大都貼有一張紅紙墨印，四週繪有花紋的字條兒，這呌做「百無禁忌</p>
<p>自然囉，「百無禁忌」的意義，是因爲咱們中國是一個崇尚「迷信」的國家，無論一舉一動，一顰一笑，在在都有「迷信」的禁忌，一般「聰明人」（？）爲免除麻煩起見，便想出了這個「百無禁忌」的玩意兒，無非是表示隨便什麼，都沒有禁忌了。一家如此，大家這樣，細想起來，那又何怪咱們中國人，到處有「百無禁忌」的事情演出，以飽外國人的眼福呢？</p>
<p>例如：馬路上的每條衖內的牆壁上，明明寫着「此處禁止小便」。可是，偏偏在這寫着「禁止小便」的字樣之下，却有大塊黃色的尿漬痕，使你要掩鼻而過！這就是咱們中國人在「百無禁忌」之下，演出的成績。</p>
<p>再如：舟車或是公共塲所之內，明明標着「禁止隨地涕吐」的字樣。可是，一樣有了鼻涕痰，依然要「隨地涕吐」的！譬如：某甲覺得喉嚨裏癢癢地，便一聲咳嗽，繼着便是撲地一口痰！譬如：某乙鼻管裏受了點刺激，打了個噴嚏，鼻涕爲之流，便順手捏住了鼻子，向地上哼地捺去，使你見了側目，他却不以爲意！這就是咱們中國人在「百無禁忌」之下，演出的醜態。</p>
<p>唉！總而言之，「百無禁忌」的例子，是很多的！只要你隨時隨地去留神觀察就得了。</p>

<p>— 唐增庚</p>
<p>淸晨，初春的陽光，初春的風，人們從冬神的嚴寒裏鑽出了挺直的身子，魚兒也在水中翻起了魚肚的白色，這熙攘的運河之濱，一切都籠罩在春神慈愛的溫柔下。</p>
<p>這裏是運河之濱一伴平凡的事：</p>
<p>是一個十一二歲賣油條的孩子，穿着一身破舊的衣衫，右手提着一隻籃，他拉開了嗓子在沒命的喊，期望在他這樣的喊聲中，可以多做點生意，多賺幾個錢。</p>
<p>孩子站在船頭，探首望有前面來的汽輪，當那汽輪近來的時候，孩子拚命的跳上那汽輪後的拖船，那知船是在動，立脚不穩，這個可憐的孩子，連人帶籃，還有那籃子中的油條和銅子，完全跌在河中，船上的人們除了啊呀一聲外，並不加以援救，好在孩子還能泳水，沒命的在水中掙扎，油條隨着流水飄去，銅子也沉入了河底，他雖在水中掙扎，但是還要搶着那油條，經過些時，一個水淋淋的孩子，才爬上了岸，對着那飄開去沒有抓住的幾根油條，還在痴痴的望着。</p>
<p>孩子滿身沾着水，放下哭喪的苦臉，他不作聲的呆立着，眼睛總是盯住那在河中的，在手中已濕軟的油條，于是他跌落在無限的悽愴裏，他得担憂着師父的毒打和痛駡，他亦担憂着油條錢的無着，一個很活潑的孩子，現在是呆立着，沉思着，不動不響，眼眶掛下兩行淚水。</p>
<p>當孩子還呆立在河濱，在河裏，就有小船在拚命的摸銅子，他們樂了，因爲他們多有了意外的收穫，可知是他們又那管這孩子的悲痛呢？，總算有幾個仁慈的先生們，送給了那孩子幾個錢，把他送了歸途。</p>
<p>這件平凡的事迥旋在我的腦海，我感覺到人間是滿佈着凄凉，孩子羣中，是有着無限的苦兒！</p>

<p>— 醉痴生</p>
<p>我友金君，是太倉人，在本市當敎員的。日前和他在酒樓相叙，他講起太倉一位富翁的故事：倒很饒趣味。特記了出來、，聊博讀者一笑。</p>
<p>這位富翁姓陳，有家資數十萬。但他秉性吝嗇，自奉也很儉約。他平日出門去，素不坐轎乘車。就是幾十里，或一百多里的路，他總是跑的。跑得肚子有些餓了，口也渴了。他一不上飯店吃飯，二不上茶館喝茶。不過半途上走過了小茶館，他就要坐下來。人家以爲他終要泡茶了，他却不然。便在身邊掏出兩個大餅，向跑堂的討了一杯開水。他邊吃邊喝，吃了大餅，再跑路。其他的節儉，也可以類推了。一天，他下鄉收租，家人們乘他不在家的時候，便做了「薺菜肉餛飩，」大家預備大嚼一頓。不料餛飩纔做好，外面有人來報，說：他老人家回來了，遠遠的看他在行走。這來，急得家人們都面面相噓，束手無策。倒是主婦（他的老妻，）很有主意，說：不妨，我自有妙計，來對付他。而且罰他作苦工，我們仍可安安穩穩的吃餛飩。說了：便命老媽子取了一升米，灑在門前廣塲上。灑的範圍，愈大愈好。老媽子便依計而行：他老人家到門首，看見地上這許多米，有幾隻麻雀正在啄着。他一陣心酸，咕嚕着說：唉：這米是誰蹧蹋的，眞正豈有此理。說着：便俯着身子，一粒粒的拾起來，放在衣斗裏。等到米織屑靡遺的拾完了，裏面的餛飩，也煮好吃好了。可憐他撫着腰背，還是不知不覺咧。</p>

<p>— 行之</p>
<p>一到春天，各地的小孩子都高興起來了，在春草如茵的平原上，携着像蜈蚣的，蝴蝶的，老人的，以至新式的飛機的紙鶴，結伴高放，這是多麼有味的事呢，我鄕有「正月軋瓜子，二月放鷂子」之謠，就可知這個季節的樂趣了。</p>
<p>放鷂是小孩子們的娛樂工作，想不到平湖的農夫，也有這種雅興！</p>
<p>我聞同事蔡君說··「所謂鷂子，最不能忘懷的，是平湖的鷂子了。</p>
<p>「平湖每到二三月的時候，桃花盛開，菜花像黃金般的舖滿地上，綠草無際，從茅舍裏走出了一羣農人，手裏各拿着大紙鷂，——雖然這紙鷂是並不裝扮得十分美麗的，但面積較普通爲大，製造比市中所買來的要堅固萬分。通常以蜈蚣式，蝴蝶式爲多，拿出以後，便趁風把它放上去，鷂繩很長，大都是他們閒暇時所搓起來的，質地多用麻，所以很靱很粗，一般人所用鷂繩只有一團，而他們常是一籮。</p>
<p>一你想！鷂繩要一籮，其數量不是很可觀了嗎？</p>
<p>一他們出去工作時，常將鷂子放起，任它們高漾天空，一隻隻的逍遙自在。而將鷂子的繩索，拴於樹上。在燦爛如錦的平原上，點綴着幾許的人工飛鳥；在將出去勞作之前，懸掛起安慰心神的旗，你想這是多麼有意義的娛樂！等到日暮回家，方把所放的鷂子收起。</p>
<p>「這鷂子還有特別感到一種興味的，就是每具鷂子裏有一架弓。這弓是用細竹穿通了中間的節，再把它抝彎的，配以薄銅片或薄白藤所做成的弦，高掛在鷂尾繩上，臨風振盪，發微妙之音。郎郎朗……，鈴鈴鈴……，　錓錓……，疾徐高下，隨風而出，好似天上的仙樂，人間的雅音，眞能吸住人的靈魂似的！</p>
<p>「數年前我走過平湖，常見這樣好玩的農家的鷂子，所謂鷂子，是最不能忘懷平湖的了。」</p>
<p>他說了這樣一大段關於平湖的　的話，使我不禁神往，想不到勞苦的農人，也有這樣的雅興！不過，近來農村破壞的日子，不曉得平湖的農人，還有從前放紙鷂的雅興嗎？</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>於是便有許多的太監打園外去挑來了好幾擔的鮮桑葉，挑來之後的却還不能不馬上應用咧；必須用熱度不很高的溫水，一張一張地小心擦洗，務必不使葉上再有半點汚垢留着。大槪每一大竹盤的春蠶必有兩個女孩子當心着：當這一個在洗刷桑葉的時候，那一個便用乾凈的手巾把已洗好的桑葉揩乾，一張張地平放到那竹盤中去。蠶兒一見了桑葉，也許不是看見的，而是用觸覺觸到的。便立卽張口大嚼起來；你如其把頭凑得低一點，便可以很淸楚地看見它們的嘴巴在不停的活動，更可以看它們從一個很小的小孔吃起，吃到可以把它們自己的身子穿過去，而所費的時間是很短的。所以每一天上，必須加兩次桑葉：一次在早上，一次在晚上：到得後來，還得加三次。</p>
<p>餵大桑葉的第一日的下午，我再去觀看時，只見各個盤內的桑葉，多半已僅留一些葉筋了，有幾條貪嘴的蟲兒，　是在筋上嚼著；我覺得當蟲兒在吃桑葉的時候，那種形態真是很難看的，並且還可以使我們聽見它們的咀嚼聲。而在這些專充育蟲用的大屋子裏，所蓄的蠶大概總在幾千條以上，因此我們一走進去，便可以聽見一陣陣悉悉沙沙的聲音，彷彿是雨點打在枯草上的響聲。（二七二）</p>

<p>我們之中有很多的人，用猶豫，懷疑，懶散，來消磨自己的歲月，而終其極，則什麽工作都沒辦成的人。我們想給這種病態加以形容，可是找不到適當的言語；想改去這缺點，可是又尋不出那癥結所在；這種生活中無疑的是缺少一些東西，可是又不知缺少的究竟是什麽。我們的眼光也許會轉到文學作品之中，普希金的奧尼金嗎？不是；莎士比亞的哈姆雷特嗎？不是；屠格湼夫的羅亭嗎？有些像，但還不是；這只是一種無爲的倦怠，一種有着良好天資良好敎育良好環境而不自振　的痼疾。我們雖不明白，但這痼疾是在我們生活的根抵中深深盤踞着。</p>
<p>這問題是有俄國龔査洛夫在他那本有名的奧布羅摩夫中替我們解答了的。這書描寫一個十九世紀五十年代的貴族，他領有數百農奴，可是賦性懶散，對農事毫不整理，他的僕人，密友，醫生都在竭力想把他從懶散狀態中解放出來，但是不能。後來同一個女子戀愛了，又怕結婚麻煩而懶於履行，結果那女子離他而去，他同另一女友同居着，抱着慢性中風病鬱鬱以終。在他全部生涯中，就沒遇過什麽飢寒問題，甚至連襪子都沒自己動手穿過；他並不是沒有理想，但他一遇冷酷的現實，便退縮了，說到工作時，什麽興奮的情緒都冷却下來。他認爲這世界是用不着改革的，以保守自己那充滿着睡眠空氣的莊園爲滿足。「有些時候在他内心的深底，爲着人類的哀傷，激烈地哭着。他感到一種不可思議的苦難與哀愁，並且熱望着走到遠遠的地方去。」但結果，甚至連搬家這件小事都不肯幹，終於退縮回自己安樂的堡壘當他的愛人訣別他的時候，向他說：「……你是像一個鴿子般地柔馴，你把你的頭放在你的翅下並不更需求什麽了，你是準備在一個屋頂下咕咕鳴呌着消磨了一生的。」是的，他就是這樣一個人，全生活中充滿一種不在乎的態度，對鬥爭進取的愛之缺乏，無抵抗與被　的忍從，這樣等閑地蹉跎過自己黃金時代，一事無成地跌進墳墓裏去。</p>
<p>這原因，就爲了他只是「頭的人」，「口的人」，而非「手的人」。</p>
<p>這作品對於我們，該是多麽深切的一個敎訓呢！一件事情都懶得做，空只是想着，想着，以保守主義拘囿住自己，這不僅是橫於俄國人生活中的痼疾，作爲一個不自振援的人的奧布羅摩夫，在我們古老的中國裏也可找到他許多朋友呢；無視現實，注眼於虛空中，而悠然送着歲月的，是早已涸息了生活之泉，失去自己立足點的人。對於這人間的贅疣，我們覺得除了嗟嘆之外，沒有別的可說</p>
<p>人類的歷史是因不斷努力的要求而增加其美麗與莊嚴的。是像亞拉伯傳說中的神鳥鳳尼克斯（Phoenix）那樣伸張着兩雙翅膀撲向火熖，以蛻化出自己新生命來的；這樣精進努力的生活，纔是使人成爲「萬物之靈」的主因吧？但奧布羅摩夫却沒福分享受這創造的光榮與愉快。我想我們之中一定有着許多奧布羅摩夫型的人物，至少，那血管中也多少地流動着些奧布羅摩夫的血液，但這樣一個作品與人物，在敎訓與啟示的意義上，無疑的是我們一面最好的鏡子的。</p>

<p>論小說</p>
<p>幾乎沒有一部論小說的書裏，不談到三部偉大的作品，一是「紅樓夢」，二是「水滸傳」，三是「儒林外史」。雖然各家的見解不同，但沒有奇妙得像上海澄衷中學校長曹慕管的。這位曹先生，讀過「語絲」的人，大概都不會忘記他。一九二四年，他寫信給某雜誌編者，論到這三部書，有「性慾小說紅樓夢，盜賊小說水滸，科學小說儒林外史」的註。像這樣論小說的人，在近年來，恐怕眞是祇有他獨步。記得沈從文也有一段論小說的妙語，好像是登在「語絲」上的張資平論」，他的大意是說，郁達夫的小說，是描寫性的苦悶，張資平的小說，却是性的發洩。對於二氏小說的閱讀順，最好是先郁後張，庶可得先「悶「後洩」之妙。這批評，眞是幽默至極，但不知沈先生寫作此文時，是否目的祇在「幽默一下」耳。</p>
<p>「欲何之？」</p>
<p>一九二五年，葉　陶先生感慨於時代的苦難，寫了一篇感想，呌做「萬方多難欲何之」？他覺得時代是離着「安逸」遠了，所謂「樂土」者，是沒有的，</p>
<p>江之南這樣，江之北也是這樣，山之東這樣，山之西也是這樣，欲何之？」他提起這個問題。他甩大禹爬到榭頂看洪水爲喩，他說，「禹雖然在四顧只見洪水茫茫的時候，决不曾歎過「萬方多難欲何之』，他不歎，他不去想那何之」的問題，他覺得這多難的國土，可以變成不多難的樂土，就决定了洽水的志願，就開了我們近幾千年歷史的首頁」。他很奇怪，「爲什麽現在的人只會歎『萬方多難欲何之』呢？」他說：「『欲何之」者，『無所之』也。」於是在結論裏，他希望每一個中國人都成爲「禹」。聖陶先生的意思，是値得尊重的，在「萬方多難」的時候，實在是「無所之」，如果不能做「禹」，事實上是祇有兩條路放在面前：「其一，給浪頭抱去，給大魚吞去：其二，化而爲魚，以期適生於洪水」。「萬方多難欲何之」？在聖陶先生提起這問題以後，我覺得仍然是有再提起的必要的。</p>

<p>— 德永直作葉蔭譯</p>
<p>那些大個子的俄國鬼，都馴馴服服服地，笑嘻嘻地給那短小的日本兵的尖銳的，像要打架般的命令斥逐着，悠悠地，闊步地走去上　房等等。</p>
<p>我曾經吃過那些俄國鬼吃的剩飯。那是放了許多菜油的小米飯。</p>
<p>「大槪俄國鬼是吃油膩的東西呀。」</p>
<p>母親收拾着簍子，嘴裏頭滿塞着成塊的小米飯說。我一聽到說是俄國鬼吃的東西，馬上就不吃了。而且，心裏還這樣想：難道我們連俄國鬼的剩飯也不能不吃了嗎？雖是沒有對母親說；但已經感到窮苦人的悲哀和恥辱。從那天起，我就再也不去看俄國鬼了。</p>
<p>（二）</p>
<p>我覺到自己的父母是個窮苦人的恥辱了。不像個七八歲的兒童，我對於事物都很多顧盧，很知趣了。</p>
<p>而且，我的親戚在村裏也是屬於頂下　的窮苦人。村裏莊稼漢們的小孩子，一看到我的臉孔，就駡着：</p>
<p>「吃剩飯的，吃剩飯的」。</p>
<p>我甚至於給那比自己軟弱得多的房東的頂小的兒子，名叫四郎次的毆打起來了。</p>
<p>雖是給毆打了，我可不哭。就是哭了，回到家裏，在母親跟前，也不敢哭。因爲如果在母親跟前哭起來，那是非給母親再打一頓不可的。</p>
<p>有一次，曾經哭着回去，於是，母親就拉着我的手，把我帶到那打我的打架大王阿源家裏去，氣得臉孔通紅的對着阿源的母親說：</p>
<p>『無論是怎樣不値錢的窮苦人的兒子，你也不應該看見給打得這麽血淋淋地還不理不睬呀！」</p>
<h3 id="c232">殘廢者 <a href="#c232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— 胡天宇</p>
<p>哥兒倆是一樣的病：半邊手足不能動彈，走路要人扶，說話時老是搖着腦袋，歪扭着嘴巴，好像不那樣他們就不會說話。一些人是把他們呌做「天生的一對寳貝」。</p>
<p>但是，哥兒倆也有不同的地方，就是哥哥是娶了親後才得的毛病，弟弟却是一出娘胎就帶着病來了。大家說：也許是他家的風水不好，才弄得哥兒倆全成了殘疾。</p>
<p>那個女人因爲要醫治丈夫的病，所以作主把祖宗從舊的墳墓里挖出來，又葬到新的墳墓里去。她希望了整整一年，終於失望了，因爲丈夫的病還是原樣，不好，也不壞。</p>
<p>這女人，本是極漂亮的，她有着黑色的眸子和桃色的頰，還有一個够得上「健美的體格。而她的丈夫却是一個殘廢者，一個世界上最沒用的東西，她怎的不煩悶，悲哀，而且時常流淚？</p>
<p>許多人時常瞧見她扶着她的丈夫走路時，就搖頭嘆氣說：「眞是作孽！一朶鮮花挿在牛糞里啦！」</p>
<p>這話刺痛了她的心，她忍不住傷心起來。可憐！她運抽泣着的時候也要做事呢！家裏窮，有什麽法！哥兒倆又都是殘疾，動不得；她再不弄點活來做，一家三條性命，不要活活地餓死嗎？</p>
<p>一年，兩年，過去了。那女人的臉龐跟着日子的過去消瘦下來。</p>
<p>第三年春天，哥哥眼瞧着妻子的面貌漸漸光采了，愁雲也消散了，換上的是一絲難掩的微笑，尤其是奇怪的，是時常有一個穿得很漂亮的男子來找她，而她也時常的跟他出去</p>
<p>哥哥知道事情有點不妙，但有沒法，自己是個殘疾，管不住女人；弟弟也是一個殘廢者，不能帮助他報仇。</p>
<p>他消極地忍着，裝着什麼都不懂得的樣子，他瞧着那一男一女雙雙地走出去時，只乾咕眼，不說一句話；他唯一的只希望就是他的妻不要離開他而走。</p>
<p>然而，這一點希望不久也就破滅了。</p>
<p>那一天，他早上起來時，便不見了妻，他還以爲她一刻就會回來的，可是，到了下午，她還不見踪跡。</p>
<p>哥弟兩個肚子餓得咕咚地饗，喊人，不應：自己又不能動彈，况且家里的米也沒有了呢。兩個人只有相對地垂淚。</p>
<p>那天她沒有回來，二天，三天，她也沒有回來，她到那天才會回來呢？</p>
<p>幾天後，人們從屋外走過，忽然聞得一陣惡臭。他們走進屋子一瞧，嚇！哥兒倆面對面地吊着，突眼吐舌，鼻子嘴巴上全是紫血，身上發出臭味。……</p>
<p>閒人們都用手揑住鼻子，皺着眉說：</p>
<p>「活寳貝變了死寳貝哪！這種人，活着受罪，死了倒是福份呢！」</p>
<h3 id="c233">東方文化學院參觀記（上） <a href="#c233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— 蘭如</p>
<p>一座像皇宮似的莊嚴壯麗的房子，被籠罩在高聳入雲的銀杏樹下，這就是東方文化學院。</p>
<p>我們去參觀的一共是七個人，各人拿出名片來交給傳達後，不久我們便被引進一間西洋式的會客室裏，在日本會朋友，或參觀什麼地方最麻煩的一件事便是脫靴子，今天却是例外，當聽差交給我們每人一雙穿在皮鞋上面的套鞋時，大家的臉上都現着高興的微笑。</p>
<p>這套鞋是用一塊黃翻布製成的，形式活像一隻小小的划子，兩頭一般大，鞋口上縫有寬緊帶，每雙都是一樣大小，這就難爲我了！如果允許我誇大一點說來，我的雙脚都可放進一隻套鞋裏去，可惜脚又不爭氣，牠們偏偏不是生在一塊。</p>
<p>從門口走進曾客室，雖然只有二十來步路，套鞋却掉了兩次，一面是感到難爲情，一面有點懊惱，好像預感到今天的參觀不會有好印象似的——因爲這東西在做怪。</p>
<p>一位瘦瘦的穿西裝的先生（名字我此時忘記了）走了進來向我們行過禮後，隨即把七張名片排列起來，像敎師點名似的又個別地認識了我們，說了許多歡迎我們來參觀以及請指敎等等的一類客氣話。</p>
<p>接着，他報告東方文化學院共有兩個研究所，一個是我們參觀的這個，還有一個設立在京都規模也和這個差不多。兩處地方每年的經　共三十萬元，設立東方文化學院的目的，在研究中國文化，以及促進一般文化的普及與向上。</p>
<p>「說起東方文化學院創立的經過來也很簡單，』那位先生謙虛地說，「最初在昭和三年十月四日，東京和京都兩帝國大學的敎授，以及熱心研究東方文化者三十餘人，在東京開了一個會議，要求政府設立東方文化學院，不久居然得到外務省的允了許，次年四月就開始進行文化學院的工作，東京和京都各設一研究所，附屬在兩帝國大學圖書館和陳列館內，同時開始複製中國的古書。後來兩處研究所的地點都規定了，於是開始建築工程，京都的在昭和五年就完工了，東京的到昭和八年夏季才完工，所以我們搬到這里來辦公，僅僅只有一年的樣子。」</p>
<p>他一口氣說到這里，我們只是靜靜地聽着，有時機械地點點頭。他似乎看出了我們因時間關係不能多聽他的說話，而願立刻去參觀似的，於是他先出去拿了許多東方文化學院一覽及開所式記念繪葉書來分贈給我們每人一份，使我們看了知道這裏面的大槪情形，以便參覜時不致於莫明其妙。</p>
<p>這房子實在太漂亮了！裏面比外面更要莊嚴壯麗！從外面看來，有點像中國北平的怡和園：裏面的石階和地板，石柱·墻壁·通通用花崗石和大理石建築成的，所以當我們踏在細滑，美麗，潔自的大理石上時，套鞋就特別容易從皮鞋上滑出來，有兩三位和我樣，走幾步又蹲下去拉住那兩隻「小船」，心裏雖萬分感到麻煩，然而也只能空着急而已。</p>
<p>自然，我們來參觀的生要目的是統計他們的藏書有多少，以及藏的什麽　，他們現在在研究些什麽。</p>

<h3 id="c234">孔夫子重遊新大陸 <a href="#c234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— 春雨</p>
<p>十三日濟南電，據日領西田談，日本東京湯島斯文會新建之孔子聖堂，定四月二十八日舉行落成典禮，並擴大孔子祭典，屆時請內外各地碩儒名士參加，以本省爲孔子故鄉（所謂故鄉是否卽指山東）尤注重，擬請顏曾思孟後裔各一人，及地方有名儒敎者二人，前往參加，並酌贈旅費，直系後裔不往時，可派代表。</p>
<p>我看了這段新聞，便笑了起來，以魯省爲孔子故鄉，便是以湯島爲客鄉了，孔子雖周遊歷國，僕僕道途，到處去過，但是從來沒有到過日本，現在又作東瀛之遊，豈非比梅蘭芳胡蝶到莫斯科去演劇和參觀電影，還要榮幸得多，以後倘還有人要請他去，他老人家或者也欣然願往，這不是孔老夫子重遊新大陸麽？</p>
<p>但是孔子的學說，是尊周室，攘夷狄，崇仁義，斥覇術，故其作春秋也，筆則筆，削則削，絕不留情，故孔子作春秋而亂臣賊子懼，不知此次請他到日本去，孔子願意不願意？並且孔子生於魯，長於魯，死於魯，世代居住山東，從來沒有搬過老家，現在日本要請他搬往湯島去住，調換調換新鮮空氣，恐孔子安土重遷。未必再作乘桴浮海的想吧？</p>
<p>孔子雖名爲聖之時，但其生性異常執拗，故孔子一車兩馬，僕僕道途，一言不合，便要走路，並且他最怕最反對的，便是打仗，從前刀槍戈矛，已覺殘忍，現在飛機大砲，更不用說，衛靈公問陣於孔子，孔子對日，爼豆之事，則嘗聞之矣，軍旅之事，未之學也，明日遂行，更有一次，孔子亦在衛，恰巧衛孔文子將攻太叔，問策於仲尼，仲尼說，我不懂，回轉來拿了行李便走，日，鳥則擇木，木豈能擇鳥，故帝國主義者的侵略政策，孔子是極端反對的。</p>
<p>並且孔子還有一個毛病，便是沒有長性，孔子周遊歷國幾十年，最長的不過住了三四年，少則不過數月，便要他往，卽使此次日本請他到東瀛去，孔子也决不肯久住，非但宗旨不合，他對於鄉土觀念，也非常之深，他一遇到打仗的事，便要跑回到家裏來，故孔子在陳，陳嘗被寇，孔子日，歸與歸與，吾黨之小子狂簡，斐然成章，進取不忘其初，不知所以裁之，他不情願在異國做官，情願回到老家做一個學究老先生，可見他鄕士觀念的深了。</p>
<p>或者說，孔子敢曾因魯國空氣不好，要住過九夷，或曰陋，如之何：他堅決地說過，君子居之，何陋之有，故朱子註曰，君子所居則化，何陋之有，可知孔子也未嘗不想到外國去遊歷一番，拿仁義道德的學說，去宣傳他的治國方針，故其說日，我聞周夏變夷者，未聞變於夷者也，他抱定用感化主義，來感化殊族，孔子所泡的目的，本來如此，所以孔子亦未嘗無搬家的可能性。</p>
<p>但孔子雖周遊歷國，到處可去，感化得好，便多住幾天，感化不好，他便要行，故其家决不肯搬，省得許多麻煩，故孔子有時看似一個老實頭，有時看似一個戇大，但有時亦甚爲滑脫見機，孔子居陳三年，會晋楚爭强，更伐陳，孔子乃去，過蒲，恰巧遇到公叔氏以蒲叛，蒲人拘留孔子，謂孔子曰，茍毋適衛，吾出子，孔子與之盟，乃使孔子從東門出，孔子遂適衛，子貢日，盟可負耶？孔子白，要盟也，神不聽，管他娘，現在日本正在預備作戰時代，可知孔子也未必肯到日本去。</p>
<p>因此吾曉得此次日本要請孔子去遊歷，孔子必婉言以辭曰，盛意甚感，但老夫髦矣，我水土不服，不敢從命、，事後必定又要取瑟而鼓，鼓曰，天之將喪斯文也，後死者不得與於斯文也，天之未喪斯文也，匡人其如予何。</p>
<h3 id="c235">孝女寺 <a href="#c235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— 胡慰雄</p>
<p>開春以來，天氣眞是太好了。每天探幽尋勝，這種豪興不像一個病人所有的。到這裏來未及二個月，對鏡自照，兩頰豐腴得多，精神方面更是說不出的痛快：這自然得感謝我的朋友。上星期發了封長數千言信給他，因爲沒有重讀一次，他的回信說我年靑人這般厭世起來，不是他最初的希望了。其實我不敢生這般念頭的，不過戀戀於世外桃源，或者不免被情感所激發了。讀了他的信，懶得去剖白，我的假期亦卽將告滿，生活的皮鞭已經高高的舉起，生存難道是「厭世」所能解决的？珍惜這最後的時間，更是每天把自己放逐在幽穆的環境中。</p>
<p>周圍這村莊之內，到處印着我的足跡。某天無意間談起想到遠一點地方去走走，老太太告訴我離此十里之遙，有廟曰孝女寺，傳說是宋時某宰相的千金，父死後削髮於此，但是後來住起和尚而稱之曰寺，就是宣揚這故事的方丈，也不知其所由來也。以後每年正月，想做孝女的村姑農婦，都不遠而來燒一柱香，叩四個頭，熱鬧的情形，遠勝於什麼廟會之類。</p>
<p>本來沒有趕熱鬧的習慣，但是見識一次奇特的風俗，亦未始不可。已經是月底了，主人爲我僱了一艘小舟，因爲到孝女寺去僅有水路可通。七歲的孩子自然又是我的伴侶了。</p>
<p>小舟就是從那天阻止我們踏雪的河道通去，一個轉灣之問，眼前另有一番新天地了。不知是誰家的墓屋，我不能估計牠周圍的大小了，松柏參天，墓道嚴然。可惜我的小朋友不能作行程上的傳述，是遺憾的事。然而今天是赴孝女寺瞧熱鬧的，也不想過分的要求了。</p>
<p>大約是二小時的水程，到達孝女寺。在能够遙望那紅牆的時候，已經聽見鐃鈸的聲音了。沿岸穿着整齊的農婦，更是不絕於道。我們的小舟在寺前停泊了，有一羣孩子圍上來，但是他們見着從船裏跳出來的是三個男子，感到失望而退。寺前是一大廣塲，各種賣小食的佔滿了，那些孝女們也不怕失了身份都圍集着點心擔充飢。並不誇大的說，我們從河岸到達廟門前是費了絕大的力量的。今天這裏近似一個比武塲，只要你有大的膂力，就可以佔前，想斯斯文文的打招呼，那是沒有一個人來睬你的。</p>
<p>孝女寺看塲面很爲偉大，因爲不敢和孝女們比武，自然也有像我們一類的瞧熱鬧的，在大殿上瞻仰了一尊男女莫辨的佛像後，就退回來了。據舟子告訴我，這寺共有五進，殿後是一個很大的菜園，大殿是第三進，所以只能從表面上去估計這孝女寺的偉大了。</p>
<p>第二進上，有十來個養得胖胖的和尚高聲誦經，做出虔誠的樣子，沒有一個敢從眼角裏偸窺那末許多當前的孝女。如果歸途上沒有舟子的解釋，我幾乎受騙了。</p>
<p>原來這寺的開支，完全靠一個正月的香火，有兩個口才伶俐的知客僧專門向比較殷實的孝女們攤費捐簿的，所以無論平時無惡不作，今天扮足了正經面孔做佛事，是他們一種斂錢的手段了。於是對於這孝女的傳說我有些不敢信任起來。初不料在這於世無爭的環境中，在我將要離別的時候，給了我這末一個掃興的影像。</p>

<p>— 里尼</p>
<p>玻璃窗外的天剛一發亮，小琳就從被窩裏翻爬起來，小麻雀似的口里哼着沒調子的歌，伸着她的小手，撫摸着琳的蓬鬆的頭髮，一會兒又轉過來，剝開我的眼皮，搖着我的身子，蒼蠅似的在耳朵邊嗡嗡着。</p>
<p>「爸爸，我要買架「嘟嘟」車，……「嘟嘟」車！」</p>
<p>昨天小琳瞧見二房東家的兒子的一架新買來的「嘟嘟」車，這眞使她幼稚的心靈高興極了。她偷偸地跑下樓去，跟着她的小朋友在客廳裏玩，玩得連晚飯也不想上來吃，一直等到琳下去把她抱上來，她還是不肯好好地吃飯，儘管哭着，鬧着，要買一架「嘟嘟」車。</p>
<p>「好吧，不要鬧，吃完了飯，明天爸爸就到公司給你買一架一嘟嘟」車吧。乖乖！…」</p>
<p>小孩子的小小的心靈，似乎還在掛念着她的心愛的玩具，夜裏有點兒睡不穩，夢中時時地發着囈語，吵着要買「嘟嘟」車。</p>
<p>「不要吵，還早哩，等一等爸爸就出去買給你吧。」</p>
<p>於是，小孩子滿意地泛上天眞無邪的嘻笑，隨後就溜下床去，口裏哼着沒有調子的歌，咚咚地下樓找她的小朋友玩去了。琳瞧見小孩子的天眞和快樂的表情，也朝着我鈎起了會心的淺笑。</p>
<p>小孩子的活潑，天眞，純潔無邪的表情和嘻笑，的確能够使小小的家庭充滿了洋洋的喜氣和熱鬧，然而，有時也爲了小孩子的事情，使做爸和媽的平地添加了許多的抑鬱與煩惱。</p>
<p>有時小孩子偶然受了一點兒風寒，身體不大偷適，緊閉着嘻哈的笑臉，木然地躺在睡床上，昏迷迷的，喪失了原有的天眞，飯也不想吃，話也懶說了，這時，琳眞是哭笑不得，整天地躱在房間裏發着愁，把小孩　緊抱在懷裏，長吁短嘆的搖着，連家務也沒有心情去料理了。這時，室内的空氣格外地感到沉悶，憂鬱，就連夫妻間的感情也都戚到冷淡，像兩個陌生的人偶然地碰在一起時候的漠不相關了。</p>
<p>「仁，小琳的「嘟嘟」車我想總得買一架給她吧。」琳遲疑地說，同時內心也似乎感到一種非常的快樂。「不然，她看見人家的「嘟嘟」車，又要哭着，鬧着，……鬧出毛病來不是更不上算嗎」？</p>
<p>我知道琳是最珍愛她的孩子的，盡</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>不多小孩子要着的東西，她都會儘量地許諾的。她寗可在家用上盡可能地節省下來，而不使小孩子戚到失望的苦痛，以傷她的幼稚的心靈。</p>
<p>「這怎麼辦得到呢？一架「嘟嘟」車最少也需要十多塊錢！……小孩子過一兩天，自然會忘記得乾乾淨淨吧。」</p>
<p>我想起十幾塊錢的不容易得來，和我們現在的經濟情况，買「嘟嘟」車給小孩子玩二似乎有點不大適合身份的，可是，小琳又忽忽地跑上樓來，小麻雀似的站在床前嗡嗡地纏着我要買「嘟嘟」車。</p>
<p>這時，我才深深地覺得這小小的三口兒家庭，已有點兒沉重得肩担不起了。</p>

<p>春風帶着暖和的氣息，從梅嶺的綿亘的重山間漏過來了，吹醒了嶺下四維叔家的烏黑的大門前的兩株車蓋似的槐樹，披上一身嫩綠的衣裳，得意地在暖和的春風中搖曳着。村上的人們，在暖和的春風蕩漾中，呈現着一種新生活發的氣象，紛忙地挑着秧子，走向田里工作去了。</p>
<p>這時，四維叔家的兩扇黑漆的大門是洞開着。從門外望去，可以很淸楚地瞧見天井裏兩邊種植着靑翠翠的夾竹桃，正廳上掛着繡着「八仙」的大紅緞彩肩，燒着紅的燭子，神桌上陳列着許多菓碟，像度新年似的，然而　下却加多了一班吹鼓手，不時地叮叮咚咚的吹打着，這便卽住足圍觀的八仙，推測到四維叔家今天定有着喜事。</p>
<p>「滾你媽的蛋—今天是老子的好日子，不要在我的面前打彩頭！…老子那有許多閒錢來白養你這畜生，已經白養你十幾年，不會做事，連生養一個把兒子也不會，…狗　的，滾你媽的蛋！…不滾，老子就要…」</p>
<p>鼻子扁平的四維叔，穿着一身簇新的水綠色綢棉袍，棉袍上再加上一伴黑　馬甲，雖則他是一個中年的人，然而今天這樣的裝扮，至少在歲數上是可以減少去幾歲的。他氣凶凶地提高着嗓子呌罵，同時，並親自動手，把一個頭髮蓬亂得像亂麻似的的中年婦人輦出門口來。</p>
<p>那中年婦人氣　咻地抽咽着，兩隻眼睛紅腫得像兩只爛熟的胡桃子，面龐　　着一層銀色的紙似的灰白，簡直不成一個話着的人。她坐在門口的石階上，腦袋低得像掛在胸脯前，小孩子似的咿咿啊啊的哭着，口里哼出不淸囈語似的話。</p>
<p>鄰近的人，男的女的，都扔去了他們的工作，帶着好奇的眼光，走過來看熱鬧，脊背靠胸膛，胸膛靠脊背，重重地把她圍繞着，不平和惋惜的氣在每個人的心坎裏交流。</p>
<p>「怎麽，四維嬸，家裏發生什麽事呢？」人羣裏竄出綽號多嘴婆厚福嫂來，嘴唇尖長得像老鼠嘴巴，蹲下去拉着四維嬸的衣角向着。</p>
<p>「自然是…因爲…年紀…老了，不…不漂亮。所以，那…老不死就說我…不能生男育女，…把我接棄，去討…年輕能裝妖…嬈的妮子哩！……」四維嬸一抽一咽地說着，喉管嘶唾得像壓着一塊沉重的石頭。</p>
<p>「眞是豈有此理！沒天良的不死的東西，自己不能生子還敢怨人，年輕的時侯，把鼻子都嫖平了，不死已算是造化，還敢想望生子！…」人羣中有人挿嘴地駡着。</p>
<p>「那還是上村長那兒去告訴，請他去和四維叔理論，痛哭又有什麼用呢」？</p>
<p>多嘴姿的厚福嫂，終於對她提出這樣的建議。</p>
<p>「上村長那裏去告訴，那又有什麼辦法呢！村長，根本就是這樣的人，從前他自己不是也做過和這同樣的事嗎？不能生育子女的女人，就得像破履似的擯棄，差不多將成村上的習慣了，告訴又有什麼用塲呢？」年老的林三爹感嘆似的說，隨後撑着拐杖離開了人羣。</p>
<p>一般人似乎知道這塲悲劇無結局，鳥散般的散開了，祇剩四維嬸孤單單的坐在石階上，一抽一咽地，時時拉起袖子在眼角上抹去了盈盈的眼淚。</p>

<p>— 宜吉</p>
<p>在這裏，不必替這位美國當代最紅的歌星，葛蕾絲穆亞（Jrace　Moore），作小傳，或是敘述她的生平事蹟。很簡單的說，她並不是生於寨微之家的小家碧玉，是然也不是什麼大家闔秀。但是她却從一錢不名的無名女子，成了舉世聞名的人物。「一錢不名」是不差的因爲她幼時一心的要學歌劇，而她的父親堅决的反對，她就决然離棄了家安閑的生活，而去求自己心之所安了。</p>
<p>她離開家庭的決定，也不是什麼率然的輕舉妄動。正相反的，她很她的家庭，而很難搶棄他們的。但是在一個再也過不去的晚上，因爲她要遵從她自己心聲的驅使，又要服從她嚴父的命令，她就獨自一個人跑到山頂上，在那人天相交的地方在那夜半萬　俱寂的時光，去考慮，去尋求，到底走那一條路。她在那山頂最高峯的一塊大石頭上仰臥著，上面是滿天星斗，心裏是個人的自由，和家庭的愛情交　着。她一直躺到東方漸漸作魚肚白，繁星一顆一顆的　沒了，她才慢慢回到家裏。她決定了她必須遵從自己的志願，至於家庭的愛情，將來可以在得志之後再設法恢復的。</p>
<p>她向親戚朋友借了三百塊錢就開始出發到紐約去了。她在紐約沒有朋友，亦沒有預約的事可做。但是她却一往無前，絲毫不疑惑她的前途，雖然她常常不知道第二頓飯，從那裏來。</p>
<p>她住在鄕間一個格林威村，和另外三個年輕女子，同住在一所布置得很簡陋的房子裏。到了白天；一早就出去尋事做。三百塊錢却是意外迅速地由縮小而消滅了，但是因爲她有如狂如醉的志願，也不憂愁，也不覺得危險。果然她不久就在那格林威村的一家小飯店找到了一個小位置—唱歌的位置。</p>
<p>那家小飯店，叫做「黑貓」，就和她以後在“One　Night　of　Love”一劇中所表演的那個意大利小飯店裏，　唱歌換飯吃的一樣。那時她的薪水剛够她一己的零用，和她所認爲必需的歌唱音樂課程的學費。但是她却一些不愁，因爲她已經得到了她心之所安了。和她同居的三個女子，亦都是性情相投，無憂無慮的女子。她說：「今天我們活　，明天且到了明天再說，但是，大家都具有勃勃的雄心，所以大家每天都奮斗著，向着各人的目的地邁進。每進一步，大家都來慶祝歐欣。多少次，我們不得不躱避房東，因爲付不出房租。我們都學會了，斗一元錢作五元錢的工作。但是我們却維持着思想上的高度，使每天的生活，成了永進不止的探險歷程！」</p>
<p>很可令人寬慰的，葛蕾絲穆亞同居的四個女子，現在都已每人得到了相當的地位了。除了葛蕾絲之外，一個是打字員，後來嫁了一位皇家子弟，現在在歐洲社交界佔着極高貴的地位；一個舞蹈家，現在亦聞名於全世界了；一位彫刻家，非但博到了藝術界的盛名，并得博到許多男子的崇拜，共中有兩個，因爲求婚被拒絕而自殺了。她們這四大金剛，直到如今還常常通信，或假地相會。這一點上，不可以證明凡是一志奮鬭的人，都可以在社會上博到相當的地位的嗎？</p>
<p>至於以後的事，多少年奮鬭的經過，如同我們上文所講的，我們並不想巷她作小傳，所以也不必詳細的叙述下去。我們要說的，就是她的野心，要在紐約最大的歌劇塲，大都會登裏，並不是一蹴而就的。她歷盡千辛萬苦，在歌舞的訓練之中，和生活的奮鬭之中，但是她說··「我所抱的野心，並不是空夢。我對於自己的能力，沒有一天失去信心。如果我疑惑了我自己的能力，如果我在前進的歷程上，不得不走曲折的小徑的時候，就自己以爲達不到目的了，在那僩時候，我就早已失敗了。一個人如果因爲曲折困難而憂悶，他是很少會成功的。」</p>
<p>她又說：「我看見多少人，爲人要完成他們的志願，而憂悶地奮鬭，我很爲他們可惜。憂悶奮鬭是不能持久的。人生精神有限，旣經過了憂悶的銷蝕，那還有餘力去奮鬭呢？所以，要奮鬭，一定要有身心的自由，不爲憂悶所　絆，低了頭上戰塲的人，是必敗無疑的！」</p>
<p>照事實上請，葛蕾絲穆亞是生長於坦納西州的山中的。她因此又有以下的幾句話：「我要住在山頂上。我是永久住在山頂上的，無論身體上，或精神上，我們自己可以創造自己的山頂。在山頂上，我們可以看見我們的夢想，在我們的眼前舒展開來。最要緊的是，我們要極夢是由多少片段凑成了，成功亦是由多少片段成功的。每一僩片段都是重要的一部份。每一僩片段都値得爲它而奮鬭。如果我未曾爲晚餐而唱歌，我或者亦不能到大都會登臺了。」</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c244">評「羣龍無首」 <a href="#c244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— 繼漢</p>
<p>The　President　Vanishes　——國泰</p>
<p>由於最近美國電影多以第二次大戰爲主要題材，我們可以知道美國人民確陷於惶惶不安的狀態之中。現在這羣龍無首之中，劇作者提出了美國是否應當參戰，當大戰爆發了的時侯。於是在劇中他假設大戰已在歐洲開始，一般軍火商或灰衫黨，（代表法西斯蒂）以保存美國之尊嚴爲口號，在報紙上鼓吹參戰。可是另一方面在第一次大戰中喪失了兒子的母親們，却不能不爲之無限悲痛。同時劇作者在最後假大總統口中提出結論：雖然美國的戰債無法收回，（這是作爲參戰之藉口的），可是這些戰債决不能賠償千百萬士兵所流去的鮮血的。</p>
<p>很明顯，劇作者是非戰的，他認爲一羣軍火商或政客爲了私見的爭吵，無非是一羣水鴨那般喋喋不休，由於一個歇斯蒂里的靑年在自由之神的像上澆上殘酒，以表示他的債恨，再在假設的國家領袖口中點出非戰的主題，他那人道主義的正誼，我們不能不爲之威動。但是，他所能做到的，是怎樣來遏止這濃厚的戰爭空氣的呢？他使大總統藏匿起來，謠言被軍火商或法西斯蒂的黨徒所綁架，使全國人民移轉目標，加恨於主戰的法西斯蒂之輩，最後並設計將右翼的領袖殺死。很明白的，這不是解决的辦法。正如劇作者所說的，美國有了許多奸險的資本家們在製造這種毁滅人類文明的戰爭，第二次大戰，帝國主義的美國政府，决不會不參加并作爲主要之一員的。劇中和平支持者人道主義的大總統，到底不過是劇作者善意的空想人物而已。一方面若干程度接觸了帝國主義戰爭之本質，而同時又將主題寄托在空想之中，正是逃避眞實的怯懦，否則便是對現實還不够深入的認識。正因爲帝國主義戰爭是阻碍人類進步的毁滅文明，那未祇有以歷史决定意義戰爭，消滅帝國主義戰爭，祇有在最後的戰爭之後，才能保障人類的永遠和平。不過話得說回來，當戰雲瀰漫着整個世界的現在，卽使是人道主義的非戰也罷，仍然有其低限度的意義。</p>
<p>我們看過這一影片，覺得它編劇的零亂，在劇的結構上不是組織嚴密的。但有些個別的塲面，Willian　A，Walman，導演處理得十分細膩周到，而且飾軍火商的幾個演員，也演得很好。不過在調子上，却是剛剛將劇情提高，突然又低落下去，沒有將幾個小小的波瀾激成一個大的浪潮，卽是說沒有一個主要的重心，作爲劇的頂點，於是祇見各個塲面散亂的個別的存在，沒有總的匯合。而且劇的進行到後半部，更見晦澀，雖然前半部頗見精采。然而導演確是費力了的，主要的過失應當由編劇擔負。形式不够內容，這一影片可爲例證的了</p>
<h3 id="c245">評「仙樂風飄」 <a href="#c245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>Music　in　the　Air大光明映</p>
<p>從外表的花色上看來，這「仙樂風飄」的確是一張「鬧忙」的片子了。這兒有葛羅剝亞史璜生與瓊鮑利司的Cast、有「Kern和O，Hammbrslein合作的歌曲，有淸歌妙舞的塲面，有並不「　板」的導演Joe，May的用心，但是，你若在內容上加以考求的話，那末這所謂「鬧忙」，却不免使你失望的，牠除了告訴你一個濫調的四角型的戀愛故事以外了就是一個樂天安命，且享受着「仙樂妙舞」之生活的說敎。</p>
<p>編劇者也明知這樣空虛的內容是不易討好的，于是和所有這類片子的編製者同樣地硬把女主角之類，派做著名的女伶，以便專用歌唱來支架下去。另外再加以滑稽的做作與幽默的對話來作唱倦了喉嚨時的調劑。</p>
<p>跟着這編劇方式來的導演者，雖有較大才氣，也苦于無所展施的了，在他有鄕村的恬靜，與都市的煩擾所用簡潔有力的剪接上可以見到他們魄力的。於是就開纖巧的手法，向輕俏的小趣味上去追尋。由于小動作運用的適當，在這方面是獲得了相當成功。特別應該提出的是寫卡爾在鄕下這兩塲，前者用小鳥作穿挿，不但寫出小孩的天眞與敎師卡爾的生活，且巧妙地介紹與刻劃出了華德的性格與當時的心情。後者用鄉村中的恬靜反映出卡爾是在怎樣的情緒中，再往都市中去找西玲。這些在情調上都臻于極成功的把握。</p>
<p>瓊鮑利司的穩重與世故人情的熱個感情，與史　生那　任性　情的演出，都達到他們各人的境地的。</p>

<p>克萊夫一面將克拉克隊長取來的幹淨衣服換上，一面徐徐地說道：「我在敵人陣地綫之中、匍匐了三日三夜，歷盡了辛苦，飢餓，難道是光爲要看看你們嗎？」曼寗不煩耐似的道：「那末到底是什麼？快說呀！」克萊夫道：「你們將所有的人交給我。我去解德里拿坡的團。」總督畢格德皺着眉，告訴他現在手下所有的人，一共祇有一百二十個。克萊夫說：「那亦可以了。」</p>
<p>堪德問道：「德里拿坡有了五百個人，還沒有法子解自己的　，你帶了一百二十個人，又怎能解他們的圍呢？」克萊夫不慌不忙地將乾凈的襪子和靴穿著，慢慢地說道：「那還不容易嗎？我不到那地方去好了」華坡敦叫喊着道：「那末你怎麼能解解他們的　呢？」克萊夫道：「我去攻亞柯特。」華坡敦道：「攻亞柯特？帶了一百二十個人去攻南印度的都會？」他想這簡直是瘋人說夢話了。</p>
<p>但是總督畢各德却了解他的意思。這雖然是近乎瘋狂的羅動，但是事已至此，瘋狂或者可以指示一條出路。他忽然想到，現在因當多有幾個瘋狂的人。這時克萊夫還帶着譏諷的語氣解釋道：「如果敵方的兵力，比你的大，你惟一的方法就是將他們分開，再將他們分開，然後一部份一部份的逐個擊破。但是這種事，你們不懂得。你們亦不用管。交艙我去辦好了。再則諸君，你們沒有別的路可走。坐在這裏是等待屠戮。現在祇有一句話，你們要不要我做這件事？」</p>
<p>總督畢各德應聲而起道：「我無條件的答應了。」克萊夫承認眞實權威之所在，向着畢各德一鞠躬，然後回頭吩咐克拉克隊長道：「將所有的人，一齊召集起來—跛的，盲的，病的，醉的，醒的，統通都要！」克拉克隊歡然地道：「是，長官！」他很敏捷地行着軍禮，然後掉轉頭來，昂然地拔步走了出去。</p>
<p>曼寗又問道：「那末你帶領了這個瘋人隊，什麽時候出發呢？」克萊夫道：「就是現在。」他站了起來，要跟着克拉克出去。忽然他又站住了問道：「忘記了最要緊的一件事了！有從家鄉來的信沒有？」華坡敦道：「信是有的，可惜船被法國人捉了去，這裏沒有收到。」克萊夫一面向外走着，一面恨恨的道：「一羣的大傻瓜。祇知道坐在尾巴上打盹。讓我的信被法國搶了去！」</p>
<p>他檢閱他的「軍隊」了，那克拉克隊長倉卒之中所召集的一般人。他心裏想着，好一個化子隊。但是他知道如果要用他們，一定先要激起他們的精神來，鼓起他們的勇氣來。他故意高聲道：「隊長，那裏來的這許多精壯的人！好極了！再好也求不到了！」他幾句話一說，巳經造成了一個小小奇蹟。這許多萎靡不振的人，居然大家屑膀伸伸平，頭抬得高高的，腰挺得筆直。大家心裏覺得，有了這樣一個長官，不可能的事亦可能了。克萊夫又問那吹號的一個小兵道：「你會吹什麽號令？」他說：「注意，舉槍，止步，後退——和向前走。」克萊夫道：「我祇要最後的一個——向前——走！」那一隊　人隊，已經開拔了。（未完）</p>

<h3 id="c250">一九三五年最新式八缸福特 <a href="#c250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>新式八缸福特最顯明的特點。在其車身的新式。與其搆造的別緻。又其機械方面。採用「中心平衡」的乘坐原則。故乘坐更為舒服。至其底盤。亦多改進之點。管理更覺容易。此種最新式福特汽車。現在行駛於路上者。已有一百三十萬輛。</p>
<p>福特廠經三年之不斷的努力研究。努力製造。始有此最新式八缸車之成就。其駕駛便易。乘坐適意。搆造新穎。俱無能及之。蓋精心改進之結晶也。</p>
<p>論其外表。意像新鮮。曲綫婉美。適合現代意趣。對於內部及一切裝具。亦從新加意經營。遂使新福特車身式樣盡善盡美。</p>
<p>其引擎與底盤方面之進步。重要亦不減於車式。其中最重要特色。為其採用新式彈簧懸置機系。又將車之重要及乘客重量分配得宜。能使乘客位置倫向車之中心。即所謂「中心平衡」的乘坐。乘客蓋乘坐在車輪之間。為欲達成此目的。將前車彈簧加長。位置於前軸之前四英寸以上。而引擎移前八英寸以上。使其重要寄託在前軸之上。前後彈簧均較從前更能伸縮。又因底盤的前端改進之故。底盤地位更見寬舒。故載客重量可能重行分配。使集中於四輪中間。因此寄託在兩軸上之重量乃能約略平等。而後座乘客之適意。正與坐在前座無異。</p>
<p>至其外面結構上之改革。則以前彈簧引擎位置之重定為主眼。車身因之得以移向前面。而乘客得能坐在車軸中間。後部鏡板亦得用流綫式布置。在彼此保險槓之間。車約加長八英寸。</p>
<p>他如發動機車。前窗玻璃。擋泥板等。亦俱新式美巧。</p>
<p>又共車輪較小。而車胎較大。行駛崎嶇道路。亦無顛簸之苦。</p>
<p>論及新福特之內部。則其地位更見寬敞。前後座均加闊。前座加闊五英寸半。可供三人乘坐。不覺擠緊。司機人之坐位。在轎車上均係活動裝置。軟墊及一切裝具。均有稱適。</p>
<p>至於引擎方面。亦改良多端。裝用直流曲軸箱通風器具。能使從曲軸箱及汽門房發出之水汽及瓦斯。排除暢盡。因此汽油中蓄收的剩餘之水。得以減至極少。而軟泥之構成與汽油之受沖淡。亦均因之減少。能延永汽油壽命。而減少引擎損傷。</p>
<p>又採用飛機式銅鉛製之接桿軸承。與用在高速度賽跑車及飛機之引擎上者相同。皆所以使能經受堅苦而無不可靠之虞者也。</p>
<p>又其合金鑄造之凸軸。亦屬新式。</p>
<p>新福特之制動器。係最新式樣。採用內部擴張式。意在給以更有效力之制動機能。而足踏力可以減低。且有一新式滑尖片。為其一部分之構造。則所以平均壓力者。其接合器新式而簡單。開車及變速時。用力少而動作寗靜。在高速度時，則因離心力而增加壓力。轉以增加接合器之原力與變速能力。</p>
<p>其接合器新式而簡單。開車及變速時。用力少而動作靜。在高速度時。則因離心力而增加壓力。轉以增加接合器之原力與變速能力。</p>
<p>至若新式堅固之框架。穩重之前後撐桿。加闊之後輪轍。以及加強之後軸。亦皆其特長之點也。</p>

<p>— 軼</p>
<p>英國工業展覽會。即將開幕。行見世界各處顧客。尚有不遠千萬里而往者。但於此聲中。英國某大製造廠。則正遴選代表。以冀開闢市場。推廣銷路。想此製造廠無他。蓋即著名奧斯汀汽車廠也。</p>
<p>該廠營業方針。既經決定。即於上星期特派海外代表一人。搭乘飛機。飛往奔馬新加坡及馬策羣島。另一代表。則往中國日本及加拿大。至第三代表。則於近東及南歐各重要之商業中心地點接洽就緒外。即遄程往波蘭。除此以外。不久並將派員前往北歐及瑞典那威等國。緣各該處貿易情形良好。奧斯汀銷數之增加固極有把握也。</p>
<p>按該廠志派海外代表。並皆有權委任經售商。及分配推銷區域等。故其使命之重要。無殊於英國商業專使也。去年份奧斯汀出口數額。計較前年增加百分之三十。今則有此大規模活動。故一九三五年份之奧斯汀出口總額。當更為諸一九三四年之上矣。</p>

<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>（一）全鋼車頂</p>
<p>在過去幾個年頭之中。汽車的上面。關於國徽的製造。很受飛行機動力化的影響。而一九三五式車身。依舊有這種傾向。事實上各車廠對於製造工作。逐年在演進。已表滿足。而並不想再去全部革新一下。我們在霎跟之間把。一九三五式新車目覩一下。似乎和上年的並沒有什麼不同。可是和一九三四式的新車細細的比較一下。便會發現本年度各廠的製造工程。偏向柔軟的曲綫。而減少關連的直綫。車身的製造。本年度完全革新的。便是外形寬放。而車身頂用全鋼製造。過往所謂全鋼車身。車頂大都用紡織物和鋼絲。可是一九三五式新車。有好多自前而後。由左而右。完全是純鋼車頂了。某一個車廠。也是名廠之一。他們雖依舊採用鋼木兩用所製的車身。在身車上其他各部。依舊有木製部分。可是車頂卻完全用純鋼製造了。</p>
<p>（二）車前形象</p>
<p>車身的前面。我們目覩之下。立刻可以發現散熱器的長而帶狹。已和往日不同。而這種散熱器。上年度非要高價汽車才採用。本年已普遍採用了。有一家車廠。為了將散熱器的格子。骨格。外殼。製造得法。使散熱器的形式很狹。長而帶狹的格子和骨格。完全用鉻片製成。散熱器殼做得和汽車的顏色一樣。寬度酌中。為使散熱的效果不損失絲毫起見。散熱殼灣曲的一面。有平綫的小孔。而散熱器殼中狹而平綫的百葉窗。屆在頂的下面。總之。車身的前面。本年度製造得很適當。散熱器的格子。骨格。前照燈邊緣。以至緩衝梗。鉻片都很經濟的採用着。擋泥板闊而低。為了泥罩。擋泥板可使底盤的下部。隱蔽着看不見。在登車階和車身的中部。側邊的泥罩。為使車身更見柔軟美觀起見。有的已取消了。</p>
<p>（三）新式風鏡</p>
<p>前後緩衝梗的背面。經過了很多的改革和設計。都有邊緣。有的更附帶防禦物。以遮蔽後車輪的上半部。散熱器和風鏡。過去二年。一般習慣。都是斜側的。本年度也是如此。散熱器殼。本年度更見混園。散熱器頂。已移向後面。恰在車身柱子的前面。風鏡是固定而調整。大概都是受到內部氣方式的影響。車室內部的通氣問題。式樣很多。而且過往已都有過成績。雙塊拼成的風鏡。斜形裝置。成V字式。使氣流轉向。有的車廠。為使改進車頂上面的通氣問題起見。扼地析上的熱氣。利用擋泥板下面或引擎側鍋下面開百葉窗而散去。至少有一家車廠。採用三志玻璃的風鏡。中間的一塊。橫貫全車。佔去很多的地位。而兩塊小的。附在兩面。佔地</p>

<p>— 敷</p>
<p>本埠大夏汽車公司。頃接司蒂倍克廠來電。據云。在今年紐約汽車展覽會開幕時。希臘王后伊利莎伯。購去特登十二汽缸。一百七十五匹馬力，利箭牌轎車一輛。輪距長一百四十四英寸。該車將漆深黑色。適與波斯國王定造之全白色鑲金之利箭車相反。其車外唯一之裝飾品。為一銀製小王冠。貼於兩後車門之中心。此外在車前左面翼子板上。須鑿一插旗杆之穴。</p>
<p>車內墊靠。務求富麗。並須配一特製之無綫電。將放聲器藏於屏風窗之上端。備胎及砲鉻之輪。則須裝在前翼子板。至於利箭車十十餘年來最著名之翼子板車頭燈。尤不可少。</p>
<p>不過該車除特定之設備外。一切與其他利箭特等十二汽缸轎車。完全相同云。</p>
<h2>Page 26</h2>
<p>較少。和中間的一塊相接　。而略爲移後一些。這種方法。無疑·在使乘客的視綫可不受限制。瀏覽車前景物。有的廠家。本年度採用峻峭的車頂。這樣一來。車身好像一隻純鋼的盒籠。頂上和車身的部分。完全熔接着。並不用釘。以全體說來。車頸展長。伸在車頂下面。所以車身的製造·結果非常堅强。汽車界方面。近年以來。所以要採用全鋼製造的車身。唯一的原因。就在車外的震力。常會使汽車震動發聲。而車身的製造原料方面。選取隔絕震力的結果。目前這種外來的震力。已完全沒有了。</p>
<p>（四）安全玻璃</p>
<p>有的車廠全車身完全裝用安全玻璃。然而有的祇有風鏡和遮風用安全玻璃。如果車主而全車要裝用安全玻璃。便要加價。不過在美國道路法規之中。自一九三五年起有所有新車限用安全玻璃的一條。每一個年度引擎方面製造的進步。在在足以增進乘客的舒適和司機的輕便。爲了底盤的進步更使座位寬大。前後座都放大。車室的裏面擱脚的地方也寬闊不少。其目的就在使車身裝在上面。而後重力的分配可以更見適宜。本年度更有很多車身移向前面。使乘客坐在輪軸的中間。同時更把引擎移向前面。把全部的重力多擱一些在前輪軸上。這種方法唯一的企圖。當然在使前後乘客同樣感到舒適。我們回想起來。幾年以來後面的乘客。每因座位齊巧置在後輪軸上面。所以時常會威到衝撞和震力。可是現在不會再有了。前後車門都較往年爲放大。本年度的新車全車的高度很少改變。然而有很多車輛在車室裏面自地板至車頂中間的地位已寬大不少呢。</p>
<p>（五）百葉小窗</p>
<p>最新式的百葉窗。本年度已普遍採用了。大致都是排成一列洞孔。分配於車頂的全長度。但有的把很多短的百葉窗。排成一長列。同時更有在百葉窗的四周。用鉻屬鑲邊。以作點綴。而注重流綫型化。預備車胎。有好多新車。放得看不見。因爲後面有一部分可以完全把車胎包裹起來。個中唯一的原因。便在這樣可使車厰方面。使車身　向後面。一無阻礙。不過有的新車。仍舊採用舊法。把預備胎放在後面露出着。或是放在側邊擋泥板上一條輸槽之中。另外有的新車。把後面的行李箱架和胎架。做在一起。把絞鏈裝了上去。除了行李之外。更可加上一個車胎。（完）</p>

<p>近年英國汽車業頗有與美國汽車業互相競爭之决心。而於一九三五年尤見顯著。美國政府爲鼓勵汽車之故。於一九三五年决减收汽車業稅率百分之二十。以資擴充產量。英國政府亦卽减收汽車稅百分之二十。卽汽車企業家亦時露與美國爭一短長之意。故一九三五年之英國汽車業大有發展之計劃。遠非昔日居於美國汽車業後者可比矣。</p>
<p>英國汽車業之中心地密特萊猶美國之地曲洛以特也。密特萊地之各汽車工廠現正在活躍狀態之下。史丹達汽車工廠尤見努力。蓋已往之史丹達汽車銷路增加。廠中工人不敷分配。而招收新工以製造矣。此外更有脫倫夫著名汽車大製造工廠亦於一九三五年中决擴大其造造部份。招收新工人百分之三十。現已正式於倫敦開始招收矣。</p>
<p>更有勞爾司魯意汽車製造廠亦於一九三五年中將有新發展。一九三四一年之中該廠之營業甚爲滿意。較之前年優異。獲利達一九九，三〇〇鎊。該廠製造汽車引擎爲最著名者。其世界高紀錄之汽車中。英國汽車之所以能獲得相當地位大抵爲應用該廠所製引擎。該廠在英國汽車界中之歷史達二十年。亦製浩汽船之引擎。甚爲完備之機件製造業。一九三五年中將採取各項新奇之機件原料。其最偉大之汽缸製造部工程師已添至二百餘人云、　（未完）</p>

<h3 id="e1">Gu De Departs from Ji'nan to Inspect Dangerous Sections of the Yellow River; Water Levels at Guantai Continue to Rise; New Engineering Methods to Be Used for Closing the Breach <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>(Jinan) Gu De, accompanied by Director Zhang Lianjia of the River Bureau, departed from Ji'nan this morning, traveling north along the Yellow River bank to inspect dangerous sections in Qihe, Guanzhuang, Taochengbu, Xiaosi, and Shouzhang, stopping the car at each location. Gu inquired and recorded details extensively, stating that Taochengbu, where the Guantai breach water enters the Yellow River, must be repaired. They will stay overnight in Fanxian County and plan to inspect Puxian and Puyang on the 20th. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Kaifeng) The responsibility for closing the Guantai breach has been transferred to the Labor Relief Group. The Ji River Bureau will be responsible for the post-disaster construction of the Golden Embankment. Li Yizhi returned to Shaanxi on the 18th night, reiterating his resignation. Kong Xiangrong returned from Zhengzhou on the 19th after arranging the transport of stone materials. Currently, only the original engineering works at Guantai are being maintained, with construction to begin a month later when materials are available. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Ji River Bureau reports that the water level at Guantai continues to rise by two centimeters. The eastern embankment is 30.5 meters, and the western embankment is 29.9 meters. Erosion at the base of the eastern embankment has reached one meter, and the flow remains rapid. Earth bags and reed mats are being deployed to reinforce the protection. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Guantai breach closure on the Yellow River has relied purely on old-style engineering methods from the beginning, leading to failure. Recent discussions in Kaifeng have resulted in a decision to adopt new methods in the future, hoping to salvage the situation. However, according to experts in hydraulic engineering here, the prospects remain uncertain, and thorough use of new engineering methods is essential for successful breach closure.

<h3 id="e2">Travelers Blocked in Yushugou; Most Are Not Allowed to Pass Through the Border <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Sharp Decline in the Number of People Buying Train Tickets; Yin Tong Reports the Truth to Beiping</p>
<p>(Beiping) Of the thousands of travelers blocked from crossing the border in Yushugou, over a hundred have been permitted to pass after strict inspection in recent days. The remaining seven or eight tenths are still staying in Tangshan's various hotels. The number of people purchasing direct train tickets to Shenyang has sharply declined recently. Eighty-nine third-class tickets were sold the day before yesterday, but only thirty-five were sold yesterday. Before the incident, the Japan International Tourist Bureau sold about a hundred tickets daily, but now only sells about ten tickets daily. The trains to Shenyang are running empty these days. Since the 14th, over 1,500 people holding tickets have sought refunds from the Eastern Travel Agency in Yuguan. Manager Zhang Shuiqi of the agency has been unable to resolve the issue with the Da Dong Company because the Japanese authorities have stipulated that anyone crossing the border must have a certificate from a relevant authority and an entry permit issued by the Japanese military police. As a result, about a thousand travelers are being blocked from crossing the border in Yuguan alone, and many more at other ports. It is said that the number exceeds ten thousand, as no one is allowed to disembark in Yingkou and Andong. Japanese and puppet troops and police are stationed at various ports, prohibiting passage and resorting to beatings for violations. (19th Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong arrived in Beiping from Tianjin tonight and met with He Yingqin to report the truth about the Japanese ban on Chinese citizens leaving the country. According to those familiar with the situation, the Japanese are restricting poor farmers and laborers from leaving the country, but not ordinary travelers. However, due to the initial implementation, the measures have been overly strict. He also said that the Da Dong Company, initially established by the Japanese in Yuguan, was an organization for housing unemployed and vagrant Japanese and Korean adventurers going abroad. The recent order to stop selling the so-called entry permits is likely part of the Japanese policy for controlling farmers and laborers. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Yin Tong stated that negotiations are underway with the Japanese side regarding the incident of the Japanese preventing Chinese citizens from leaving the country, but complications are expected, and a resolution may not be reached in the short term. Regarding the issue of receiving Malanyu, Yin Rugeng is currently inspecting the area, and the date has not yet been decided. The New Security Force's entry into the war zone is being prepared. The time of departure will be determined after another round of consultations with Yu Xuezhong upon his return to Tianjin. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) After the China Travel Service withdrew from the Eastern Travel Agency, the agency will be taken over by private individuals. Our side has not yet decided on the candidates. Zhang Shuiqi has no intention of proceeding alone. The South Manchuria Railway continues to task Hirayama with responsibility. Ii (Yi) will arrive in Beiping next week, and the Chinese and Japanese sides will discuss this matter further. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) A diplomatic source stated that the ban on Chinese laborers going to Guanwai (outside the pass) is indeed to prevent the increase of the Qing Shazhang (Green Gauze Tent) uprising army and the influence of too many Chinese on the migration of Japanese and Koreans. Recently, the puppet regime's finances have been disrupted, and the currency value has plummeted, mostly because Chinese people are hesitant to invest due to the unstable political situation in the puppet regime, and those with cash are remitting it to Guannei (inside the pass), causing the exchange rate to soar. The current restriction on Chinese people going there is to prevent future profit-sharing and maintain financial stability. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) Travelers unable to cross the border, as they have purchased through tickets from the Eastern Travel Agency, surrounded the Eastern Travel Agency in Shanhaiguan, demanding refunds. The agency, citing the large number of people, was unable to process the refunds. Japanese military police guarded the premises, preventing travelers from approaching. Zhang Shuiqi went to Shenyang on the 18th to negotiate, hoping to allow those who had purchased tickets to cross the border and avoid further trouble. This afternoon, about two hundred male and female travelers returned to Beiping and Tianjin from Shanhaiguan, all of whom had been blocked from crossing the border. According to them, Japanese police officers, in collaboration with the military police, were conducting strict interrogations of travelers leaving the country at the Da Dong Company. Even those travelers who were permitted to cross the border feared that there would be many problems upon entering the puppet state. Therefore, after being interrogated, they changed their plans on the 19th and canceled their trip abroad. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Japanese army at Gubeikou is enforcing strict martial law, and the puppet police have begun strictly inspecting travelers, prohibiting Chinese citizens from leaving the country (20th).</p>

<p>(Hankou) Chiang Kai-shek telegraphed the chairmen of all provinces, stating that conscription and construction are the only central tasks for each province in the future. To ensure their effectiveness and continuous implementation as a fixed practice, effort should be made to develop the land and production in each region using the labor of the local people. This requires the design, supervision, and capable leadership of the provincial chairmen. He requested detailed reports on the progress. He also ordered all provinces to relocate tombs along major roads to avoid obstructing traffic and to complete county and township public cemeteries within the year. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Zhang Xueliang's private residence now has an additional puppet police team stationed. Banla Mountain and Haiju Island have been extensively repaired. The Japanese side is publicly claiming that they will develop the island into a trading port, but in reality, five Japanese warships have been deployed to the port, suggesting that it will be used as a naval fortress. Within a hundred li of Huludao, there is a strict military alert, and Huludao has become a secret area. (19th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The puppet Fengtian Railway Bureau established an office in Jin County last year to plan the development of Huludao and the industries of western Liaoning and Jehol.

<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the upgrade of the Chinese and Japanese diplomatic missions, the Japanese Embassy in Beiping has only revealed this informally. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs stated that they have only seen reports in the newspapers and cannot make a judgment. Ambassador Ariyoshi's three-year term expires in July of this year, and he has not yet mentioned his return to the country to the Ministry. Some have met with Ding Xingcun, the counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Japan, who said that the matter had not been raised when he left Tokyo. However, recent motives may be unknown. Japan has already exchanged ambassadors with Britain, the United States, France, Russia, Italy, Brazil, Turkey, and other countries. There have been past proposals for our country, and if this news is true, it is only a rehash of old news. Regarding the difference between the status of an ambassador and a minister, in diplomatic terms, the upgrading of a diplomatic mission represents an elevation of the national status and a closer relationship between the two countries.

<h3 id="e22">Japan's Prohibition of Chinese Laborers from Crossing the Border <a href="#e22" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c22" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">22</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Beginning on the fourteenth of this month, the Japanese side suddenly prohibited Chinese laborers from crossing the border. When the news spread, the number of people who wanted to go to the Northeast and were blocked in Yuguan was in the thousands. These people were in a dilemma, and even the elderly and children were living in the streets, becoming refugees in a miserable state. Therefore, the Beining Railway authorities have posted notices at various stations along the line, advising laborers not to go rashly to avoid becoming displaced. Our government has also begun to study the facts in order to find ways to respond.</p>
<p>The biggest reason for Japan's prohibition of Chinese laborers from crossing the border to make a living is that the number of Chinese laborers crossing the border has recently increased, which is enough to affect the migration of Japanese and Korean people. Nami Jirō, the commander of the Kwantung Army, had previously promulgated measures to restrict Chinese laborers from crossing the border to make a living. The reason why he is now prohibiting Chinese laborers from crossing the border is probably because of the implementation of the measures he promulgated.</p>
<p>Japan's immigration to Manchuria and Mongolia is one of the steps in its implementation of its continental policy, which did not start today. However, since it has ruled our four northeastern provinces with a puppet regime, its progress has become more active. In January 1933, the Japanese side gathered representatives from the Kwantung Army Special Service Department, the Army Staff Headquarters, the Embassy, the Consulate General, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Governor-General of Korea, and the Kwantung Government in the Kwantung Army Special Service Department to form an immigration department to preside over all immigration matters. Later, with the assistance of the military, it recruited more than 1,200 veterans and moved them to the Songhua River area. Immigration training centers were established in Beidaying and Gongzhuling to train talents to preside over immigration affairs. At the same time, it used the power of the puppet regime to expand its land commercial lease rights in the Northeast. Therefore, by July 1934, in addition to the land commercial lease rights that Japan had already obtained in Liaoning, it also obtained the commercial lease rights in the Songhua River basin, Rabin, Tunning, Binbei, Qibei, Heihe and other nearby areas, and the suburbs of Harbin. After obtaining the commercial lease rights in this vast area, the Kwantung Army Special Service Department convened representatives from the Kwantung Army, the South Manchuria Railway, the Ministry of Colonial Affairs, the Governor-General of Korea, the East Asia Reclamation Company, the Mitsubishi Tozan Agricultural Company, and puppet organizations in Changchun from November 26 to December 6 to hold an immigration conference. It was resolved to organize a joint government-private reclamation company with a capital of 50 million yuan, of which the Japanese government would provide 20 million yuan, the puppet organization would provide 10 million yuan, and the remaining 20 million yuan would be raised from the private sector. From this point of view, it can be seen that Japan's immigration to our Northeast is not only determined early, but since the establishment of the puppet organization, it has planned and progressed more vigorously in many ways. The active progress of this immigration project is an important step in implementing the "annexation policy", and its prohibition of Chinese laborers from going to Guanwai to make a living is actually a means of promoting this policy.</p>
<p>Recently, Chinese citizens who go abroad to make a living are often rejected. For example, Mexico and Japan have successively expelled our overseas Chinese and sent them back to their home countries, and Siam has recently closed Chinese schools. These are the most prominent examples. Now, the four northeastern provinces were originally our territory. Japan has already occupied them by force, and now prohibits Chinese laborers from going there to make a living. Can people not deeply feel the pain of the increasingly narrow outlet for our country's population? The existence or non-existence of an outlet for the population has a great impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood. It is hoped that our government will actively negotiate to seek remedies on the one hand, and promote the development of domestic production enterprises to relieve unemployed farmers and workers on the other hand. If this is the case, the thorns in the future of our "nation" and "people's livelihood" can be gradually removed.</p>

<p>(London) Labour MP Mound inquired in the House of Commons today about the matter of loans to China, asking if there were any recent developments. Eden replied that there had been no changes since Foreign Secretary Simon's answer in the House of Commons on February 6th. According to Simon's reply, the proposal for a loan, after careful study, was deemed by the government not to be a satisfactory remedy. As for any official correspondence between China and other countries regarding this matter, he could not comment. Whether it is feasible to assist China with loans and have all countries participate to the greatest extent depends on the Chinese government announcing its views. Mound then asked the government to guarantee that it would not allow the Japanese government to oppose any loan proposals put forward by other countries. Eden replied that this issue had not yet arisen. (Reuter, 18th)</p>

<p>(London) Following Britain's strong protest to Germany, and despite Germany's renewed declaration of its peaceful intentions, Britain today still plans to further increase its naval and air defenses. After the government's note to Germany was issued, Mr. Hacking, representing the War Office, immediately proposed in the House of Commons an increase of £4 million in defense spending. It is noted that the government had already planned for this year's naval, land, and air force expenditures to increase by £10 million over last year, totaling £124 million. Today, Mr. Hacking reiterated, "In light of Germany's declaration, we need to seriously consider and increase appropriate coastal and air defenses." Foreign Secretary Simon announced that Britain had consulted with France and Italy and may request the League of Nations Council to convene a special meeting to discuss Germany's actions. As for the British note to Germany, it was delivered by Ambassador Phipps to German Foreign Minister Neurath. In addition to protesting the implementation of conscription, the note stated that Britain was unwilling to cancel Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden's visit to Berlin at the end of this week. However, the visit must be based on the original purpose and scope. London is quite of the opinion that Germany will refuse to participate in the European peace plan. However, Germany had anticipated Britain's protest, so within a few hours, a reply was sent to London, with a particularly peaceful tone, assuring Britain that Germany was very willing to join with all countries in the world in any effective peace efforts, and solemnly declared its readiness to discuss reducing armaments and welcomed agreements similar to the Anglo-French agreement of February 3rd. The British note contained a clear request for Germany to return to the League of Nations, which Germany apparently noticed. After receiving the reply, Britain immediately announced that Simon and Eden's trip to Berlin would proceed as originally scheduled, flying to the German capital on Sunday. Eden expressed hope that Germany would participate in the Anglo-French air force convention, but said that if Germany was unwilling to participate, Britain and France might conclude another agreement to jointly defend against external aggression with their air forces.

<p>(Paris) The British Chargé d'Affaires, Campbell, recently informed Foreign Minister Laval of the contents of his government's note to Germany. The French government is now planning to take similar measures and will instruct its ambassador to Germany to lodge a protest with the National Socialist government. At the cabinet meeting on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Laval will present the wording of the protest for approval so that it can be sent out. France is currently maintaining close contact with Britain and Italy. It is likely that Italy will also participate in the protest. The British government has recently decided to maintain the plan for cabinet members to visit Germany for consultation. France has expressed its support, as this move will make Germany aware of the gravity of its responsibility, and a definitive answer can be obtained regarding the country's intentions for international cooperation after the British cabinet members' consultation.

<h3 id="e26">French Cabinet Meeting Today <a href="#e26" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c26" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">26</a></h3>

This written protest is intended to supplement the verbal protest made by the French ambassador to Germany last Saturday. Foreign Minister Laval also telegraphed the French ambassadors in Rome and London last Saturday, instructing them to inform their respective governments of France's views. Laval's instructions advocated swift and forceful action against Germany and the convocation of a special meeting of the League of Nations Council to address the situation. This news has now been confirmed by diplomatic circles. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>

Although no official statement has been released, according to political sources, the discussion focused on the issue of Germany's rearmament. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French military plans are progressing further today to cope with Germany's rearmament. Member of Parliament Dumont proposed to the Chamber of Deputies to extend the current active military service by one year, to two years. The military service bill recently passed by the Chamber of Deputies only increased the future military service to two years, and current active military personnel were not affected by it. Today's proposal would extend the current French active military service by one year. French sources said that France has only 230,000 soldiers, and if the military service is not extended, it will decrease to 118,000 by 1940 due to the low productivity during the Great War. But Germany says France already has more than 500,000 troops. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>

The meeting passed the following resolutions: (1) Announcing that France will force the term of military service to be extended to two years; this measure does not consolidate national security; (2) Requesting the conclusion of an international convention stipulating mutual assistance methods and nationalizing the manufacture of public armaments.

<p>(Moscow) Although the official response to Germany's rearmament plan has been silent, according to news today, Soviet Russia has asked French Foreign Minister Laval to come here immediately. The significance of Soviet Russia's invitation to Laval is believed here to be to consolidate friendly relations with France and to unite against Germany. Since the former French Foreign Minister Barthou adopted a collective policy, Franco-Russian relations have become increasingly friendly. Currently, Soviet officials believe that Germany's new policy affects France and Russia the most, so former allies should be able to reunite to prevent problems before they occur.

<h3 id="e28">Content of British Protest <a href="#e28" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c28" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">28</a></h3>
<p>(London) The British government's note to Germany stated that the British government felt compelled to protest Germany's rearmament. After the German government announced the establishment of an air force, there was the recent declaration. This unilateral action, apart from the point of principle, also greatly increased unrest in Europe. The proposal for a meeting between British and German authorities arose from the joint Anglo-French communiqué of February 3rd and the German reply of February 14th, and the subsequent correspondence between the British and German governments. The British government believes that it is now appropriate to draw Germany's special attention to these documents. The note then listed the various documents, followed by saying that what Britain was planning was a comprehensive solution through free negotiations between Germany and other countries, to replace Section V of the Treaty of Versailles for Germany. The British government's policy was aimed at the success of this effort. The British government has concentrated its efforts in Geneva and elsewhere to achieve success in this. The German government's decision to substantially increase its army's strength beyond any previous proposals cannot facilitate the success of a broad agreement, which seeks to replace the provisions of the Treaty of Versailles with a common pledge. Moreover, if this strength remains unchanged, it will hinder the negotiation of an agreement with the major powers concerned. Even if it does not become impossible, it will become more difficult. The British government is extremely unwilling to abandon any opportunity that the visit of British cabinet members to Berlin may provide to promote general understanding. However, in this new environment, British cabinet members must, before engaging in this, draw the German government's attention to the above points and wish to obtain assurances and know that the German government still wishes this visit to become a reality in accordance with the previously agreed scope and purpose. That purpose is that the purpose of this meeting should be to discuss the points raised in the Anglo-French communiqué and move to a deeper stage. The points raised in the Anglo-French communiqué are</p>
<p>(1) The British government stated that if Austria's independence is endangered, it is willing to consult with other signatory countries to the Rome Agreement of February 17, 1934.</p>
<p>(2) Britain and France agreed that Germany and any other country's joint armaments provisions cannot unilaterally change this obligation.</p>
<p>(3) Britain and France agreed that what could help restore peace would be a solution through free negotiations between Germany and other countries to replace the articles in the Treaty of Versailles that restricted Germany's armaments and military strength.</p>
<p>(4) Britain and France believe that Germany's return to the League of Nations is essential. After receiving the British note, German Foreign Minister Neurath studied it briefly and then informed the British Ambassador in Berlin that the German government still wished Simon and Eden to visit Berlin in accordance with the previously agreed scope and purpose. (Reuter, 19th)</p>
<p>(London) The London newspapers all unanimously supported the British government's note to Germany protesting the rearmament. The Berlin newspapers also expressed great satisfaction. However, judging from the comments of the Paris newspapers and the opinions of semi-official circles, the entire nation of France was filled with shock and anger. The London morning newspapers all had positive comments on this note, and even the Daily Herald, the organ of the Labour Party, praised its wording and magnanimity. Several newspaper editorials expressed satisfaction that Germany had not closed the door to continued negotiations, but said that although Foreign Secretary Simon would go to Berlin to discuss everything with German leader Hitler and others in accordance with the previously agreed scope and purpose, it would not be easy to harmonize Hitler's declarations with the proposals contained in last month's Anglo-French communiqué. Berlin believed that the British note could bring Germany closer to other countries and regarded Foreign Secretary Simon's continued visit to Germany as a sign that international tensions had eased. According to a Reuter dispatch from Berlin, Germany expressed great satisfaction upon hearing the news that Simon would still visit Germany. The Frankfurter Zeitung welcomed the British note, calling it a pleasing expression of British common sense. The Essener National-Zeitung, the organ of Prussian Prime Minister and Aviation Minister Goering, said that since Germany is now implementing compulsory military service, the number and type of tanks, the caliber of artillery, and the strength of each other's air and naval forces can all be discussed in Berlin. According to a Reuter dispatch from Paris, the French newspapers' comments on the British note often used words such as "weak" and "submission," and some even used phrases such as "One wonders if our British friends are watching a mirage" and "Germany's atrocities are now a beautiful and free gift." Paris now feels that the close cooperation between France and Britain, which has been established recently and has greatly satisfied France, has now been broken. The Paris evening paper declared that France's policy is now swinging between two extremes, one being Moscow and the other being London. If Franco-British cooperation cannot be realized, then Franco-Russian cooperation will naturally follow. (Reuter, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e29">United States Pays Close Attention <a href="#e29" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c29" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">29</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull met here today with President Roosevelt's special envoy Davis, who was specially summoned here, to discuss the European situation. After the meeting, Hull told reporters that the United States is currently adopting a wait-and-see attitude and paying close attention to the situation. Hull and Davis et al. were very concerned after hearing the news of the British note to Germany, but did not wish to express their opinions. Hull said that he had not discussed the European situation with any foreign envoys, nor had he received any official correspondence from foreign governments regarding this matter. The US Ambassador to Germany is constantly reporting all developments in detail to the State Department. Hull and Davis are likely to discuss everything with President Roosevelt in the next few days. Senator Pittman, chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, told people today that, in his opinion, the United States should not get involved in the European crisis. Germany's decision to rearm is the result of competing countries failing to jointly establish a new defense system except for military alliances. (Reuter, 18th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Regarding Germany's abolition of the military articles of the Treaty of Versailles, Secretary of State Hull did not wish to comment, but the United States now seems to have the following impressions: Germany's decision is enough to eliminate various misunderstandings, the future negotiation situation can be clarified, and the Treaty of Versailles will also suffer a fatal blow as a result. The United States believes that the difficulties that have arisen in Europe after the European War should be blamed in part on Versailles. The US government is now paying attention to studying the impact that European events may have on the Far East, fearing that the Soviet Union will have to increase its western border defenses as a result and neglect its Far East defenses. If so, the United States' position towards Japan will also be weakened as a result. However, this kind of worry is ultimately too vague. What attitude the United States will take towards Germany's actions, and whether it will lodge a protest with Germany when necessary, may not be affected by this kind of concern. (Havas, 18th)</p>
<h3 id="e30">US Fears German-Russian Conflict <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(Washington) In diplomatic circles here, the intense action of Germany's resumption of conscription is deeply feared to lead to a conflict with Soviet Russia. Although opinions vary, some expect that Soviet Russia will not be able to stand idly by as Hitler, the great enemy of communism, takes on the role of commander of a large army. If a conflict occurs, Poland may side with Germany, and Japan may attack Soviet Russia from the east. Observers say that the Soviet Union currently has an armed force of 830,000 men, and the number of trained reserves is even higher. After the German conscription plan is implemented, it will only have 500,000 men, among whom very few can fight. Senior US Army and Navy officers believe that Germany's action may not lead to war, as this action only restores the balance of power before the war. Moreover, as an important country in Europe, Germany cannot remain excluded from military equipment for long. The US government does not wish to express any formal opinions on this new development in international events, but has held several meetings in recent days, and the State Department was also open all day on Sunday. Government leaders declared that the United States could not have any formal statement before President Roosevelt, Secretary of State Hull, and Special Envoy Davis met at the White House. Davis rushed here from New York on Sunday and had a brief meeting with Hull. (National Telegram, 18th)</p>
<p>(Moscow) Pravda commented on Germany's implementation of universal military service, saying that the significance of this matter is not only the increase in the quantity of German armaments, but the importance of this new step by German imperialism lies in its demonstrative nature. Hitler solemnly declared that the Treaty of Versailles restricted German armaments, so it was just a scrap of paper. This posture towards the Treaty of Versailles was expressed just one week before the British Foreign Secretary's visit to Berlin, and Britain and France were the drafters of the Treaty of Versailles. German fascism has resolutely moved towards war preparations. It opposes the formula of "security first, then disarmament." It does not mention the formula, but takes action directly. Its intention is to say, "Let me arm first, and then talk about peace." The German diplomatic community explains the purpose of its fanatical military expansion with the phrase "Germany wants peace." Pravda commented, "This desire for peace is fully expressed by the German government's inaction on the Eastern European Pact, which is the only tool that truly equally guarantees the security of all signatory countries." Pravda concluded, "It is not superfluous for us to mention at this moment the just observations of the elderly, namely, that the aggression and tactics of the German fascists are based on a belief, namely, that the hesitation and wavering of the policy taken by Britain will at some point enable its tactics to achieve overall victory." Therefore, the phrase "appeal to the German nation" is re-added to the spices of a reply (which is actually extremely vague) to the British Empire. It is not accidental. (TASS, 18th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) Officials here predict that the League of Nations may convene a special conference to discuss the possibility of Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles threatening international peace. It is claimed that British Foreign Secretary Simon has stated that if British-German negotiations fail, Britain may request this action, and it is understood that France also supports the League of Nations handling this matter. Although Germany has withdrawn from the League of Nations, member states of the League of Nations may take countermeasures or other disciplinary measures. However, there will be no action before officials from Britain and Germany negotiate at the end of this week. Britain hopes to enable Germany to rejoin the League of Nations. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Observers here predicted today that if the League of Nations can notify Britain and France to recognize the German conscription system, Germany will rejoin the League of Nations. Leader Hitler is now waiting in Bavaria for the reaction of various countries. It is heard that Germany intends to reserve the right to restore its navy when treaties are concluded in the future. Although the Treaty of Versailles restricts Germany to only having pocket battleships, it is also powerless to interfere with Germany building a new navy. After the conscription system is officially recognized, Germany will be able to recruit 600,000 soldiers in 1936, second only to Soviet Russia in Europe. (National Telegram, 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e33">Hitler's New Diplomacy <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The scheduled visit of British Foreign Secretary Simon and Lord Privy Seal Eden to Germany has been confirmed. It is generally believed that the new approach to diplomacy adopted by Führer Hitler can be seen as a victory in this move. Semi-official sources, after the government's decision to restore compulsory military service, were deeply concerned about the global backlash, which is indeed the case, but all are trying to conceal it. This is because the countries concerned, whether in Berlin or Geneva, have not taken joint action, and all are overjoyed. Official circles only vaguely mentioned the British protest, dismissing the British argument that unilateral action should not change treaties as "mere rhetoric," not worth worrying about. The National Socialist Party authorities believe that since equal rights to armaments have been obtained, they only need to intensify negotiations diplomatically. Germany has agreed to participate in the Western European Security Air Pact, but it still seems unable to accept the Eastern European collective security plan. (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, all German national newspapers published an article by Propaganda Minister Goebbels, discussing the reactions of various European countries to Germany's announcement of conscription on March 16. Goebbels stated, "The world's reaction to Germany has caused deep surprise throughout Germany, because Germans firmly believe that the whole world should be reassured and satisfied. Germany's open announcement of the restoration of conscription clearly demonstrates Germany's determination to strive for security and balance of power. For several years, the so-called mystery of Germany's defense problem has provoked several formal and informal protests from the major powers. The most prominent of these protests stated that without a thorough understanding of Germany's intentions, lasting peace is impossible. Since receiving these formal and informal protests, Germany has repeatedly considered abandoning its secret policies and openly declaring its true intentions and the policies it is implementing. The completion of this intention is particularly important today, because newspapers in various countries constantly make empty and unrealistic estimates of Germany's defense capabilities, spreading misinformation and causing mutual panic among nations, which is greatly detrimental to the prospects for peace. Therefore, Mr. Hitler's bold move is sufficient to dispel the above-mentioned rumors and malpractices. On November 28, 1934, during a debate in the British House of Commons, Churchill pointed out that Germany's defense capabilities far exceeded the number of people obtained through the conscription system of March 16. However, Churchill also said at that time, 'Even so, we have no reason to say that the Germans will attack Britain.' Churchill further declared in the same speech that the time had come to dispel the mystery of German armaments. Why, then, does Germany's public declaration of its military strength today provoke such discrimination? Moreover, for the past fifteen years, Germany has hoped that the signatory countries of the Treaty of Versailles would fulfill their disarmament obligations, but instead of disarming themselves, these countries have expanded their armaments. Mr. Hitler has repeatedly declared that if all countries in the world are willing to take the same bold action, Germany would not hesitate to destroy its last gun and bullet, but those who spoke sincerely were ignored. Therefore, today Germany is in a desperate situation and has to face the current facts, knowing that a country without armaments, surrounded by powerful neighbors with great armaments, is sufficient to provoke war. Today, the veil of mystery has been removed, and Germany has emerged to interact with the world's powers on an equal footing. If it can contribute to the guarantee of European peace and the harmony of the world's nations, it is willing to work hard and follow diligently." (National News Agency dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A senior German political figure, in response to an interview with a Havas News Agency reporter, stated that Germany's rearmament has not caused a backlash internationally, which is gratifying. The fact that there has been no international backlash is a victory for Germany. The British note to the German government yesterday has not yet been published. When the Havas News Agency reporter inquired about its content, the senior official said, "The wording of the British note avoids the term 'protest,' and according to its meaning, it does not protest the measures taken by Germany from a legal perspective. In terms of diplomatic language, this note can be said to be appropriate. As for the conditions under which Germany accepted the visit of British cabinet members, the reason is very clear: Germany's position is now much stronger than it was two weeks ago. Since Germany's equal rights to armaments have been obtained, there is no need to discuss this issue further when Britain and Germany hold talks. This is why the German government accepted the visit of British cabinet members." The Havas News Agency reporter further inquired about the number of personnel in Germany's formation of twelve army corps and whether the German navy would also be rearmed, but no definitive answer was given. The conclusion was, "Germany has no territorial demands on France. Hitler has said this repeatedly. Germany hopes to enrich the Locarno Pact, but does not hope for an Eastern European mutual assistance pact, because we already have the German-Polish Treaty, which is sufficient. We hope that Britain can understand this." (Havas dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<h3 id="e34">British House of Commons Passes Army Budget, £450,000 for Anti-Aircraft Guns, Barracks to be Built in Hong Kong to House British Troops <a href="#e34" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c34" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">34</a></h3>
<p>(London) The House of Commons discussed the army budget today, which lasted for a long time and repeatedly mentioned Germany's rearmament. Finally, the budget figures were passed. It was found that this figure included £450,000 specifically for improving anti-aircraft guns. The Labour Party moved to reduce the number of army personnel by three thousand, but this motion was defeated in the House of Commons by 206 votes to 44. When Financial Secretary to the War Office Hacking presented this budget, he stated that Germany's decision to rearm made it necessary for Britain to maintain adequate coastal, air, and land defenses. Coastal defenses, whether domestic or foreign, are also being renewed, and there is no sign that the number of British troops overseas can be reduced for the time being. Britain cannot allow the effectiveness of its combat troops' equipment to be inferior to others. The budget provides for a phased approach to ensure that combat troops have the necessary equipment. This is not an expansion of the army, but a slight improvement to reach the appropriate standard that was put aside during the disarmament negotiations. Opposition leader Lansbury requested a debate on the German situation be scheduled before Parliament adjourns. It has now been decided that the debate will be held on Thursday. The date was originally scheduled for the discussion of the India Bill, and the discussion of the India Bill will be postponed at that time. (Reuters dispatch on the 18th)</p>
<p>(London) Financial Secretary to the War Office Cooper answered questions in the House of Commons today regarding the progress of the defense of the British-owned island of Lai, stating that Britain had spent £7,325,000 to build the impregnable naval base in Singapore, and will now allocate another £7,500,000 for the base's military expenses to complete the Far Eastern defense of the British Empire. The small island was a desolate area a hundred years ago, but in the British national defense plan, it has become the Gibraltar of the Far East. A 600-acre aircraft landing strip has now been opened. According to unofficial sources in London, the base is currently increasing its heavy artillery equipment. (National News Agency dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(London) During the debate on the army budget today, the House of Commons mentioned the issue of building barracks in Hong Kong to house three battalions of British troops. Labour Party member Attlee stated that building barracks for three battalions of soldiers would require as much as £2.25 million. Financial Secretary to the War Office Hacking replied that the construction of barracks would have to be done in the future. For now, only £100 is being requested to facilitate the investigation. Specific measures have not yet been determined. If it is necessary, this expenditure will be included in the budget for the following year, at which time the House of Commons will have ample opportunity for discussion.

<p>Karachi A Muslim named Abdul Qayum stabbed a Hindu to death with a sharp blade because the Hindu had written a paper insulting the Islamic prophet Muhammad. After the court determined that it was intentional homicide, he was sentenced to death, and the execution was scheduled for this morning in the prison here. A large number of Muslims gathered around the prison early in the morning. During the execution, the crowd was indignant and showed signs of rioting. The police dispatched more police to suppress the situation to prevent disturbances. After the person was executed and the body was moved to the burial ground, the public anger could not be contained. Thousands of people cried and ran to the burial ground, dug up the body, and attempted to take it away. The police intervened and suppressed them, but the police force was insufficient, so the army was ordered to assist. The officers were pelted with stones. The officers then issued a warning that if they did not disperse, they would open fire. The crowd ignored the warning, and the soldiers opened fire on the crowd with live ammunition. As a result, nineteen people were killed and sixty were injured. The rest dispersed. All the dead and injured have been sent to the People's Hospital. In addition to dispatching police to protect the hospital, the authorities have now taken precautions to prevent more serious incidents. (Reuters dispatch on the 19th)</p>

All the ambassadors stationed in Tokyo attended. First, Foreign Minister Hirota explained in detail the intentions of the Foreign Ministry regarding the resolution of all pending issues between Japan and the Soviet Union after the completion of the agreement on the transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway. He requested the ambassadors to express their opinions in order to exchange views on opening up relations between Japan and the Soviet Union. Vice Minister Shigemitsu also gave a concrete explanation of the policy of adopting diplomats based on the answers to the China case by the Institutional Efficiency Committee established within the Foreign Ministry. He said that the principle of the so-called "open door and equal opportunity" should be based on the principle of talent, and that it was urgent to reform personnel in order to make diplomacy effective in times of crisis. Next, Commerce Bureau Director Kurausu expressed his absolute opposition to the establishment of a so-called Ministry of Trade, arguing that all diplomatic negotiations, whether political, diplomatic, or economic, should be completely under the jurisdiction of the Foreign Ministry. If a so-called Ministry of Trade were established, the right to economic diplomacy would be taken away, and it would be inconvenient in terms of close and rapid action.

<p>(Moscow) The Soviet People's Committee discussed today the plan for the opening of various new factories this year, the use of which will exceed the planned construction costs for this year, reaching 22,466 million rubles. There are 2,000 large factories currently under construction, of which 1,178 will be fully or partially opened this year. The power generation of power plants will increase by 750,000 kilowatts. In terms of the fuel industry, 41 new coal mines will be added, with a total output of 23.2 million tons. Fourteen new oil crushing plants will be added. New steel plants worth nearly 1.5 billion rubles will be built. The workload of blast furnaces will increase by 10.2%, open-hearth furnaces by 20.8%, rolling mills by 14%, and aluminum plants by 80%. This year, the Soviet Union will have its own magnesium mines. There will be two automobile factories with an output increase of 55,000 vehicles. The opening of new light industry factories will cost 73.8 million rubles, compared to only 48.1 million rubles last year. The new railways that will be open to traffic this year are worth a total of 4.4 billion rubles. The new railways that are regularly open to traffic are 367 kilometers long, and those that are temporarily open to traffic are 1,151 kilometers long. In addition, 3,247 kilometers of double-track railways will be built, of which 2,182 kilometers are in the Far East. New houses worth a total of 2.4 billion rubles will be built.

<h3 id="e47">Results of Various Provincial and Municipal Post Offices Selling Revenue Stamps <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Sales in January Exceeded 780,000 Yuan</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Since the Ministry of Finance transferred the sale of revenue stamps to the post offices, the results have been good, which has greatly benefited the elimination of harsh taxes in various provinces and the income of the national treasury. A Central News Agency reporter learned that the revenue stamps sold by the post offices in November of last year totaled more than 550,000 yuan, which increased to more than 588,000 yuan in December, and increased to more than 780,000 yuan in January. Taking the five provinces of Jiangsu, Fujian, Shandong, Hebei, and Chahar, and the four cities of Beijing, Shanghai, Ping, and Qing as examples, the number of stamps sold in January has exceeded the number sold by the revenue stamp bureaus in each month of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. For example, Shandong Province and Qing City sold more than 74,000 yuan per month in the 22nd year of the Republic of China, but increased to more than 115,000 yuan in January. Hebei Province previously sold more than 86,000 yuan per month, but now increased to more than 143,000 yuan. Ping City previously sold more than 17,000 yuan per month, but now increased to more than 26,000 yuan. Shanghai City and the concessions previously sold more than 78,000 yuan per month, but now increased to more than 114,000 yuan. However, merchants in Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, and Hubei provinces have failed to affix revenue stamps as required or because of incomplete inspection of the revenue stamps affixed, resulting in the fact that although the number of revenue stamps sold by the post offices in January increased compared to the number sold in November and December of last year, it was still less than the number of stamps sold by the revenue stamp bureaus in each month of the 22nd year of the Republic of China. The number of stamps sold in Anhui, Jiangxi, Hubei, and Henan provinces in January decreased by between 4,900 yuan and 9,900 yuan compared to each month of the 22nd year of the Republic of China, while Zhejiang decreased by as much as 62,000 yuan. In addition to notifying the provincial governments and ordering the provincial and county revenue stamp bureaus to promote inspection, the Ministry of Finance will also send cadres to various places for strict inspection to avoid losses to both the national treasury and the compensation to various provinces.

According to Mao, the group members are responsible for suggesting plans for suppressing bandits to the military sub-committee and directing various units to suppress bandits. (Special dispatch on the 19th)</p>
<p>(Beiping) In order to eliminate banditry in northern Shaanxi, the military sub-committee specially organized a staff group stationed in Shaanxi and ordered them to go to direct the suppression. The group has one director, who has been appointed to the former Baoding Military Camp Chief of Staff Mao Kan. There are more than 20 members of the group, all of whom are transferred from the staff and political training departments of the military sub-committee. The organization is roughly the same as the staff group stationed in Sichuan, but the scope is smaller. The group has military and political groups. Mao himself serves as the director of the military group, and Bao Jieshan serves as the director of the political group. Everything is now ready. Mao led all the group members to take the Pinghan train to Shizhuang this morning at 7 a.m. to transfer to Bing to contact the Suide authorities on everything. In one or two days, they will go to Shaanxi to supervise the suppression. According to Mao, the nature of the staff group stationed in Shaanxi is the same as the staff group stationed in Sichuan. In the future, there will be two tasks: (1) to suggest to the military sub-committee strategies for suppressing bandits and communists; (2) to supervise and direct the military operations of various armies. The address of the group stationed in Shaanxi after arriving in Shaanxi has not yet been determined. It is planned that the initial work will be to first investigate the real situation of bandits and communists in various places, and then supervise and urge various armies to suppress them. The fundamental strategy of the group should be based on the standard of "three parts military and seven parts political" advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, so political personnel are more important.

<p>(Xiamen) At 12 p.m. on the 19th, a bustling time for business, the Fengtai Trust Company Bank, established by Japanese Taiwanese Lin Mushi on Xiamen Zhenbang Road, was attacked by twelve robbers.

<p>(Nanjing) Although our country's budget law has been formulated, it has not yet been implemented.

Currently, according to the opinions of budget specialists from the Directorate General of Budgets, Accounts and Statistics, the Ministry of Finance, the National Audit Office, and various agencies in charge of budget proposals, it is generally believed that the budget law, after several years of informal application, urgently needs many amendments. (1) The boundaries stipulated for the budgets of administrative agencies are too strict and should be made more flexible and adaptable. (2) The stipulated period for handling preliminary estimates and budgets is inappropriate and should be adjusted. (3) Various attached tables also need to be improved based on the results of trials and verifications. Based on the above opinions, a certain legislator has compiled them and will soon prepare a bill to be submitted to the Legislative Yuan for deliberation. (19th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>Extensive Flooding in Puyang, Fanxian, and Shouyang Counties; Disaster Area Spanning Over 450 Li; Over a Million Starving Disaster Victims</p>
<p>A dispatch from Jinan reports that since the breach at Changyuan on the Yellow River, floodwaters have flowed eastward, entering Shandong Province along the Jin Causeway. Puyang, Fanxian, and Shouyang counties in western Shandong are now submerged. The disaster area stretches over 450 li east to west, from the breach at Changyuan to Taochengbu on the Donghe River in eastern Shandong, before rejoining the main river. No fewer than a million people have been affected. Representatives from Puyang, Fanxian, and Shouyang counties have repeatedly petitioned in Jinan, requesting the closure of the breach. However, as Changyuan is under the jurisdiction of Hebei Province, Shandong Province claims it cannot intervene, resulting in no action. The breach at Guantai continues to widen, increasing the flow of water, and the flooding in western Shandong is worsening. Although the central government has resolved that the National Economic Council, in conjunction with the Ministry of Finance, should discuss relief measures, no concrete decisions have been made. With no hope of spring plowing, hundreds of thousands of disaster victims in western Shandong are starving. They have appointed Jiang Mingqian, Liu Enlun, Zhang Jianling, and Ding Liquan as representatives to telegraph Premier of the Executive Yuan Wang Jingwei and Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi, urging them to quickly allocate a large sum of money and order the Hebei and Henan provincial governments to close the breach as soon as possible to save the people and protect their lives. Simultaneously, they have telegraphed Shandong Provincial Chairman Han Fuju, requesting him to forward a petition to the central government on behalf of the people. The original telegrams are transcribed below:</p>
<p>Telegram to Ministers Wang and Kong</p>
<p>To Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan and Minister Kong of Finance in Nanjing: The Yellow River has repeatedly breached at Changyuan in recent years, causing severe flooding in Puyang, Fanxian, Shouyang counties of Shandong Province. The breach remains unblocked, and there is no hope for spring plowing. A million lives are at stake. We urgently request a large allocation of funds to order the governments of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces to close the breach immediately and complete the work within a set time limit to save the people and protect their lives. Jiang Mingqian, representative of disaster victims in Shouzhang County, Shandong; Liu Enlun, representative of disaster victims in Yanggu County; Zhang Jianling, representative of disaster victims in Puyang County; Ding Liquan, representative of disaster victims in Fanxian County, respectfully bow.</p>
<p>Telegram to Chairman Han of the Provincial Government</p>
<p>To Chairman Han of the Shandong Provincial Government: Since the Yellow River has repeatedly breached at Changyuan in recent years, the four counties of Shouzhang, Yanggu, Puyang, and Fanxian in Shandong Province have suffered severe flooding. For two years, there have been no harvests, and the livelihood of the farmers has reached its limit. Many young and strong have fled to all directions, while the old and weak await death in their homes. Spring plowing is approaching, but the breach remains unblocked. The water depth in the fields is three to five feet, making it impossible to harvest wheat, and even autumn crops will be difficult to plant on time. Alas, our compatriots are suffering through this calamitous year. The affected area is located south of the Jin Causeway and north of the Linhuang embankment, extending approximately 450 li east to west from Changyuan County in Hebei to Dong'a County in Shandong. Over a million people have been affected. The disaster is undeniably severe, and the affected area is undeniably vast. If no measures are taken to close the breach quickly, the peach blossom floods will soon arrive, and the disaster area will inevitably expand further. In the unfortunate event that the Jin Causeway fails, the Yellow River will shift north, turning Tianjin and other ports into marshlands. The consequences are too terrible to contemplate. As representatives entrusted by hundreds of thousands of disaster victims, we respectfully present the true situation. We respectfully request that you forward this to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, urging them to promptly allocate a large sum of money to close the breach as soon as possible to save the people and protect their lives. Apart from sending separate telegrams, we hereby submit this telegram for your review and instruction. Jiang Mingqian, representative of disaster victims in Shouzhang County, Shandong; Liu Enlun, representative of disaster victims in Yanggu County; Zhang Jianling, representative of disaster victims in Puyang County; Ding Liquan, representative of disaster victims in Fanxian County, respectfully bow.

<p>Provincial Government Borrows 1.6 Million for Road Construction; City Bonds Used for Construction of City Government and School Buildings</p>
<p>A dispatch from Hankou reports that the Hubei Provincial Government, in order to meet the needs of highway construction, previously obtained central approval to issue 6 million yuan in construction bonds. Provincial Chairman Zhang Qun convened leaders of the Wuhan-Yangxin-Hankou chambers of commerce to discuss fundraising methods. It was decided that the standard for bond purchases would be one month's salary for employees of shops in the three towns of Wuhan, Yangxin, and Hankou, and one month's rent for landlords. The issuance began on April 1st. However, due to the large amount of these bonds, it would be difficult to raise the full amount immediately. During the bandit suppression period, highway construction could not be delayed. In addition to the 600,000 yuan already borrowed from the Bank of Communications and the Hubei Provincial Bank by the Department of Finance to first repair the Hanyi Road, it has now been decided to borrow 1 million yuan against 2 million yuan in bond certificates from the Hankou Banking Syndicate. Negotiations on this matter have been ongoing for days and are nearing completion. Sixteen banks are participating in the loan, including the Bank of China (127,000 yuan), Jin City, Zhongnan, Zhejiang Industrial, Siming, China Agricultural and Industrial, Salt Industry, Continental, Zhejiang Industrial, Shanghai, and China General Commercial banks (63,000 yuan each), China Industrial, China National Products, Juxingcheng, and Guangdong banks (32,000 yuan each), and the Bank of Communications (115,000 yuan). The interest rate is one percent per month, and the loan will be repaid in four installments over thirteen months. The Department of Finance authorities will soon formally sign a contract with the Banking Syndicate leaders. As the provincial construction bonds are about to be issued, the Hankou Municipal Government is also issuing 1.5 million yuan in municipal construction bonds. The uses of these funds have already been determined: 300,000 yuan for the construction of a new municipal government building, 400,000 yuan for the construction of vocational schools and elementary school buildings, and the remaining 800,000 yuan for road construction and the relocation of civilian housing. These bonds have been submitted to the central government for review by the Legislative Yuan and are expected to be issued within two months at the latest. (17th)</p>

<p>As reported yesterday, a large-scale prison break occurred at this county's prison at 6 PM on the 18th. It is now learned that the prison held a total of 139 inmates. Yesterday afternoon, after the usual lockdown and roll call at 4 PM, the inmates planning the escape took the opportunity to create a disturbance. They broke their shackles and tied up the guards and the warden's family. At that time, Warden Shu Zhang was in the street purchasing food bowls for the inmates and had not yet returned. The police rushed back, and fourteen inmates cut the telephone lines and stormed out of the prison gate, fleeing in different directions towards Wangyun Bridge and other streets. Order in the city was disrupted for a time. Special units of the Public Security Bureau, the water patrol, and the security brigade were dispatched to pursue and capture the escapees. County Magistrate Jin, President Yang, and Chief Prosecutor Zhu all arrived to supervise the situation. They conducted a roll call and ordered strict surveillance. Military police captured two escapees, Zhang Baogen and Lin Yunquan. The remaining twelve escapees are still at large, and search parties are out looking for them. Among the escapees is Xia Ziyun, a local resident serving a life sentence; Xia Damazi and Xia Sanmazi from Yancheng, serving twelve years; Shang Shaorong and Chen Tu, also local residents; Jiang Er from Yancheng; and Hu Musheng, a local resident. All these inmates were convicted of robbery. After the incident last night, patrols around the prison were increased. Today, Warden Li reported the incident to the authorities. County Magistrate Jin and others inspected the prison. The chief guard, surnamed Li, was severely beaten by the escaping inmates. The authorities believe that the chief guard was negligent in his duties and ordered him to be detained for investigation.</p>

<p>Last year's drought was severe, and suffering was widespread in this county. The County Party Headquarters, recognizing the urgent need for spring relief, is organizing a charitable drama performance, with the local theaters taking turns to perform. The proceeds from ticket sales will be entirely used for spring relief. Yesterday, the performance was held at the Zhongnan Grand Theater, with actors from the Pingju Xin Guang and Qingsheng theaters, and special appearances by the son of the famous performer Xiao Dazi, Li Shaochun, and all the talented actors from the Xiu Ji Gengxin theater. It was a grand occasion.</p>
<h3 id="e112">Armed Conflict Erupts Again in the Shatian Case in Changshu <a href="#e112" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c112" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">112</a></h3>
<p>The Fulidi and Dingfeng companies in Shazhou City have repeatedly engaged in armed conflicts over the issue of constructing Shatians, disregarding human lives. Recently, the Department of Finance ruled that the county-administered township concession should demarcate the two companies to separate them, and that they should no longer dispute. Secretary Li of the County Government went to the township to establish this agreement. Recently, Jin Minjun from the County Shatian Bureau, Qian Zhun from the County Government, and Wu Zongbao from the Department of Finance were dispatched to jointly monitor the demarcation. All the commissioners arrived in the township the other day, but found that the previously agreed boundary had been uprooted by the Fulidi Company, which had redrawn it more than a hundred zhang into Dingfeng's land. Dingfeng was extremely dissatisfied and was about to inquire when another dispute erupted. Hundreds of sand farmers from each side gathered, resulting in Chen Shengjie of Dingfeng being severely injured. The commissioners were also obstructed and had to retreat, awaiting a resolution of the dispute before returning to the township. Both sides have sent the injured to the city for medical treatment and have reported the incident to the County Bureau. As a result, this year-long dispute over the Shatians remains unresolved.</p>
<h3 id="e113">Zhenjiang: Jiangsu Farmers Bank Opens; Loans for Seedlings and Silkworm Cocoons Granted <a href="#e113" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c113" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">113</a></h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Provincial Farmers' Bank has been effective in assisting rural development in the past. With spring plowing now underway, all spring loans have been opened. Loans for seedlings and silkworm rearing in particular will greatly benefit agricultural production. The methods are described as follows: (1) Seedling loans are provided in the spring and summer, limited to purchasing fertilizer, seeds, agricultural tools, livestock, and machine oil. Farmers applying for loans must detail the number of mu cultivated, the types of crops, and the intended use of the funds. After approval by the bank, loans are issued in kind to prevent misuse. The loan amount is approximately 50% of the expected harvest, and the harvest is designated as collateral. Since the establishment of agricultural product distribution centers in Shanghai and other locations, purchasing seeds, fertilizer, and agricultural tools has become more convenient. Farmers can substitute in-kind collateral for loan applications. This year, the total loan amount has been increased to 4 million yuan to ensure widespread coverage. (2) Silkworm rearing loans are provided twice a year, in spring and autumn. Farmers rearing silkworms can apply for loans, limited to purchasing silkworm eggs and mulberry leaves. Those purchasing eggs will be provided with improved breeds by the bank, and the sericulture guidance center will send personnel to provide guidance. These loans are most common in Wuxi, Wujiang, Suzhou, and other areas. In recent years, silk prices have plummeted, and banks have seen little profit. Few cocoon markets have opened, and silkworm farmers lack outlets for their fresh cocoons, which is a major issue. The bank cannot establish its own cocoon markets to purchase cocoons, so it has implemented a regulation allowing loans to cocoon markets to enable timely openings and avoid affecting the sale of fresh cocoons.</p>

<p>Wang Yunzhang, a resident of Huaiqing Bridge in Nanjia Village, a carpenter with some savings, bought two houses last month. As they were still being repaired, he was temporarily residing in the empty house of Wang Shanzai. At approximately 5 PM last night, a fire broke out in that house. The fire was extremely fierce and impossible to approach. Fortunately, the fire brigade arrived and extinguished the flames after a period of time. After investigation, it was found that over twenty houses, including those of Wang Renren, Wang Shanhua, and Wang Heshang, and six single-story houses were destroyed. Wang Yunzhang's newly purchased houses were spared due to the efforts of the firefighters. The total loss in the village is estimated at around 10,000 yuan.</p>

<h3 id="e115">Ministry of Finance Orders Bank of China to Devise Methods for Relief of Industry and Commerce <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Compilation of News from Various Sources</p>
<p>New Sound News Agency reports that regarding the plan to relieve industry and commerce, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Bank of China to devise suitable methods. Local associations and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have also issued statements. A compilation is provided below:</p>
<p>Ministry of Finance Orders Bank of China</p>
<p>Emergency Plan for Relief of Industry and Commerce: (1) Small Credit Loans; (2) Commodity Mortgage Loans. The Association requested the Minister of Finance, Kong, to adopt and implement these plans. The Ministry replied: "Received. The current state of industry and commerce necessitates relief. The emergency relief plans, which you state should be organized and implemented by the Bank of China-led syndicate, should be carefully considered and reported back. Please be informed."</p>
<p>Reply from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce replied: "In response to your letter and the attached two emergency plans for relieving industry and commerce, we acknowledge your concern. The Chamber has long been deliberating on methods to revive the market. Previously, we agreed on five measures with the Local Association (already reported). We have separately submitted letters to the Ministry of Finance, the Central Bank, the Savings Guarantee Reserve Committee, and the banking and money trade associations for adoption and implementation. Your letter is appreciated. However, the second measure, Commodity Valuation and Mortgage Loans, corresponds to the fifth measure proposed by us. We have already requested the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China to accept these mortgages as much as possible. The first measure, Small Industrial and Commercial Credit Loans, is also consistent with the fourth measure proposed by us. If the government promotes these relief measures and the banking and money trades support them, they will be mutually beneficial and effective. We have discussed and agreed on the outlines of four key points for small industrial and commercial credit loans with the Local Association and have submitted them to the Ministry of Finance for adoption and implementation today. We are replying accordingly for your information."</p>
<p>Letter from the Local Association</p>
<p>The Shanghai Local Association replied: "In response to your letter proposing two relief plans for the urgently needed relief of industry and commerce in this port, we convened a special committee meeting on the 9th to discuss the first plan, Small Industrial and Commercial Credit Loans. We propose that the Bank of China and the money trade launch a syndicate with a total of 5 million yuan to provide small loans specifically for industry and commerce. At the same time, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association will request the Ministry of Finance to allocate funds. The procedures for the loans will be determined by the syndicate. We await the separate decisions and implementation by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Banking Association, and the Money Trade Association. We are replying accordingly for your information."</p>
<p>Separate Letters to Various Groups</p>
<p>After receiving replies from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Local Association, industry and commerce are preparing to first conduct surveys and registrations to accurately determine the need for small credit loans. The original letter stated: "We have learned that the Local Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce have discussed and replied regarding the two emergency relief plans for industry and commerce agreed upon by our conference. We are enclosing the replies. If any of your members require these loans, please conduct surveys and registrations for preparation. Once the implementation date is set, or if difficulties arise along the way, our conference will still be responsible for lobbying the relevant groups." At the same time, a pledge form is being drafted to invite various groups to participate in the organization to facilitate progress.</p>
<p>Bankers' Luncheon</p>
<p>Members of the Banking Association, such as Zhang Gongquan, Tang Shoumin, Xu Jiyu, Ye Fuxiao, Bei Songsun, and others, over ten in total, had lunch at the Banking Association conference room at noon yesterday, adjourning at around 1 PM. A New Sound News Agency reporter learned that the association holds a luncheon every Tuesday, where they discuss various issues. Yesterday's luncheon touched on small industrial and commercial credit loans, but no decisions were made.</p>
<p>Subcommittee Discussion</p>
<p>Regarding the proposal for 5 million yuan in small industrial and commercial credit loans, the Local Association and others decided that the government and the money trade would each provide half of the funds. Although the money trade has decided not to join the syndicate, the government and the banks will continue to implement the plan. The members of the subcommittee formed by the Banking Association are Chen Guangfu, Tang Shoumin, Xu Jiyu, Ye Fuxiao, Bei Songsun, and Wang Yansong. It has now been decided that Chen Guangfu will convene a meeting to discuss how to jointly implement the plan for small industrial and commercial credit loans with the government as soon as he returns to Shanghai today.</p>
<p>Wang Yansong's Remarks</p>
<p>Yesterday, a New Sound News Agency reporter interviewed Wang Yansong, a consultant to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, at the Silk Industry Bank, seeking his opinion on the issue of market recovery. Mr. Wang delivered the following remarks: "The current economic downturn in Shanghai is complex. The bankruptcy of rural areas, the massive trade deficit, the outflow of silver, and the ripple effects of the global economic crisis are all major factors. In simple terms, it is deeply affected by the decline of the entire national economy. Therefore, from the government to the common people, everyone is in a difficult situation, with little disparity in hardship and happiness. Whether we can overcome the difficulties and return to prosperity depends on whether we can focus on self-awareness and self-help, one heart and one mind. In this situation, if all sectors of the country blame each other or make overly high demands without considering reality, it will not help and will only increase the terror. As the saying goes, 'Adversity builds a nation.' We should not be discouraged by this. First, we must stabilize people's minds, and then, with a calm attitude and a hardworking spirit, from the government to the financial, industrial, and commercial sectors and the general public, we must work together with one heart and one mind to reduce the huge trade deficit, balance international payments, and prevent the further outflow of silver. This is the fundamental solution. The short-term measures proposed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and others are generally appropriate, but in my opinion, they still require the genuine cooperation of all parties. The commercial acceptance bill created by the silk industry is a way to increase the circulation of capital and allow stagnant accounts between companies to become more flexible. It is a way for each industry to save itself with its own strength. If each industry can work hard separately and cooperate fully, the current impasse may be gradually broken."</p>
<p>The Money Trade Has Replied</p>
<p>The Money Trade Association decided that the business of money houses is primarily based on credit loans, and there is no need to join the syndicate. At the same time, Chairman Qin Runqing urged member money houses to undertake as much business as possible. The Association has now replied to the Local Association with the resolutions of the extraordinary general meeting of members. According to a New Sound News Agency reporter, there are a total of 57 member money houses in the Money Trade Association. If each house can expand its industrial and commercial credit loans by an average of 50,000 yuan, it would increase the financial assistance to industry and commerce by 2.85 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e116">Real Estate Developers Plan to Issue Circulating Notes; Banking Circles Denounce as a Wild Scheme; Absolutely Impossible to Realize <a href="#e116" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c116" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">116</a></h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that real estate developer Cheng Linsheng and others recently held a meeting to discuss ways to revive the market and resolved to organize the Shanghai Commercial and Economic Association to prepare for the issuance of 50 million yuan in real estate circulating notes. Yesterday morning, a Central News Agency reporter inquired with banking circles about their opinions on this matter. Most banking leaders denounced this as a wild scheme and stated that it could not be realized under any circumstances. They explained the main reasons why it could not be realized: "A group of real estate developers wants to raise 50 million yuan in real estate circulating notes to relieve the economic downturn, which is commendable. But how can these 50 million yuan in circulating notes be issued? And once issued, how can they circulate in the market? This is a major question. According to the association's proposal, the circulating notes would be like paper money, so the issuance of 50 million yuan in circulating notes would require a 60% cash reserve. In other words, issuing 50 million yuan in real estate circulating notes would require 30 million yuan in cash reserve. The total amount of silver in Shanghai is only 300 million yuan, so it would be very difficult for a group of real estate developers to raise this 30 million yuan cash reserve. Furthermore, the real estate developers are acting unilaterally in proposing the issuance of circulating notes. If they were to issue them, would they be understood and exchanged by all parties? All these are major questions. Therefore, we have no other opinion on this move by the real estate developers except to see it as a wild scheme. It is absolutely impossible to realize."</p>
<p>According to the opinion of the Banking Association, even if this plan achieves 1% success, it would only benefit a small number of real estate developers by turning their real estate into liquid assets. While this would be a great benefit to them, allowing them to adjust and maneuver, it would not have any beneficial impact on society as a whole. The Banking Association believes in a steady approach to market recovery and rejects unrealistic schemes.</p>

<p>Bank of Communications Borrows 600,000 Yuan; Contracts with the Other Two Banks to be Signed at the End of the Month</p>
<p>Industry News Agency reports that, in order to complete the Jiangnan Grand Railway project, the Jiangnan Railway Company, in addition to its original capital of 3 million yuan, had already received approval from the Ministry of Railways to issue 3 million yuan in public bonds, with the Ministry of Railways responsible for paying interest and the Construction Commission guaranteeing repayment. Yesterday, Pang Yuanhao, the company's assistant manager, told the Industry News Agency reporter that the 3 million yuan in public bonds had been negotiated with the Bank of Communications, the Bank of Shanghai, and the Bank of China. The banks agreed to lend 2.4 million yuan against a mortgage of the entire 3 million yuan in public bonds. The proposed contract contents were also approved by the three banks. As the Bank of Communications was borrowing a smaller amount of 600,000 yuan, a formal contract was signed yesterday afternoon by Tang Shoumin, the manager of the bank, and himself (Pang Yuanhao). The weekly interest rate is 6%. The signing of contracts with the Bank of China and the Bank of Shanghai, which are borrowing larger amounts, will be delayed slightly and are expected to be completed by the end of this month.</p>

Mayor Wu has scheduled a luncheon for the four commissioners at the Water Hotel at noon today. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Yesterday's Inspection of the City Center Area</p>
<p>Yesterday, accompanied by Lu Jingshi, an executive member of the Shanghai New Life Movement Promotion Association, and Chen Duzhen, Deputy Inspector General of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, the four commissioners first visited the Sixth District Party Headquarters on Xinmin Road in Zhabei, and the Northern Shanghai District Security Corps Headquarters, and also inspected the Northern Shanghai City Area.

<h3 id="e120">Three Veterans - Rescheduled Entry into Sichuan from Yesterday Morning - Unable to Sail Due to Heavy Fog on the Huangpu River Yesterday Morning <a href="#e120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>According to the Zhonglian News Agency, three veterans, Li Shihui, Wu Zhihui, and Zhang Jingjiang, due to receiving an invitation from Chairman Chiang in Chongqing to enter Sichuan, boarded the Minsheng Company's Yongnian steamboat the night before last at 12:00 AM, heading west into Sichuan. The steamer was originally scheduled to depart west at 6:00 AM yesterday morning, but a unprecedented heavy fog suddenly arose on the Huangpu River, making navigation difficult. Therefore, the steamer was unable to depart on time. It was not until 10:45 AM yesterday morning, when the weather cleared, that the Yongnian steamboat departed from the Datong Wharf, raised anchor, and sailed west. According to the Zhonglian News Agency reporter, citing Minsheng Company sources, the steamer is expected to arrive in Chongqing on the 30th of this month.</p>
<h3 id="e121">Shenxin No. 7 Factory Decides to Redeem - Principles Agreed Upon, Efforts Made to Raise Large Sum - Chen Guangfu Goes to Beijing for Instructions, Will Return to Shanghai <a href="#e121" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c121" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">121</a></h3>
<p>According to the Xinsheng News Agency, after the Shenxin Textile No. 7 Factory was auctioned by the British-owned HSBC Bank, Mayor Wu and others negotiated with the bank for redemption and have already reached an agreement. Efforts are now being made to raise funds. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Redemption Principles Agreed Upon: Lawyer Okamoto, a Japanese national who bid at the limited price of 2.25 million, insisted on not disclosing the buyer's name, making it impossible to know it until now. Whether the payment has been made is also questionable. However, according to the Xinsheng News Agency reporter's investigation, whether the payment has been made or not is not of great significance. After Mayor Wu and others negotiated with the head of HSBC Bank, it has now been decided in principle to redeem. However, raising the large sum of 2.25 million yuan is the most important key at present.</p>
<p>Chen Guangfu Goes to Beijing to Discuss Fundraising: Rong Zongjing, the general manager of Shenxin Textile Company, believes that it is impossible to raise funds for the 2.25 million yuan redemption during this time of extreme economic difficulty, and the only hope is the government. Now, the second person in charge, Chen Guangfu, the general manager of Shanghai Bank, has gone to Beijing to seek instructions from the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Industry, and the Ministry of Finance. He is scheduled to return to Shanghai today or tomorrow. Whether the redemption funds will be borne by the government or arranged by Chinese merchant banks will depend on the outcome of Chen's negotiations with the government.</p>
<p>Shenxin No. 7 Continues to Operate as Usual: The Shenxin No. 7 Factory on Yangshupu Road has 56,284 yarn spindles, 13,440 thread spindles, 449 looms, and about 4,000 workers. It continues to operate as usual, and has not yet received a handover notice from the British-owned HSBC Bank. The reason is that after Mayor Wu and others negotiated, a redemption agreement has been reached. Therefore, HSBC Bank is waiting for our side to prepare the funds for redemption. Once the funds are raised, it will be implemented. In short, the redemption is no longer a problem.</p>

<h3 id="e122">Art Exhibition Preview - Antiquities to be Displayed Soon <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the London Chinese Art Exhibition has been in preparation for two months. Currently, except for the review work, which is not yet completed, other matters such as the layout of the venue, security, fire protection, and glass display cases have been properly handled. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Tang Xifen, the secretary of the exhibition, yesterday and learned that:</p>
<p>The Review Will Be Completed Within Days</p>
<p>The review and selection of antiquities, except for porcelain, bronzes, jade, silk tapestries, and cloisonné, is complete. Only the calligraphy and paintings and the antiquities sent by the Academia Sinica for display are not yet finished. Work is being intensified to complete it within days and compile a catalog.</p>
<p>Opening Date Not Yet Determined - British Commissioners Viewing Antiquities</p>
<p>The opening date will be decided after Commissioner Yang Zhensheng goes to Beijing to attend the preparatory committee meeting. However, the display can begin in four or five days.</p>
<p>The four commissioners specially sent by the London Chinese Art Exhibition to China to select antiquities are still residing at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, viewing antiquities at the exhibition daily. This morning (yesterday), they finished viewing the bronzes, and this afternoon they viewed the jade. The antiquities, porcelain, and subsidized calligraphy and paintings from the Palace Museum have also been transported to the exhibition in two batches yesterday and today and placed in storage.</p>
<p>Protection Measures Determined</p>
<p>The other day, Yang Zhensheng, Lei Zhen, Gu Shusen, and Tang Xifen from the exhibition, together with honorary executives Li Dachao and He Dekui, discussed detailed measures at the Bank Club on Hong Kong Road and decided to form a "Guard Unit" jointly by the Public Security Bureau and the Public Concession Public Security Bureau Police Department to handle the matter. Today, they plan to test whether all the electrical wiring is safe and install fire extinguishing agents.</p>

<h3 id="e124">Chamber of Commerce Cables the Ministry of Finance - Requesting Swift Implementation of the New Stamp Tax Law <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce cabled the Ministry of Finance yesterday, saying: "Nanjing Ministry of Finance: The Huaibei Pingshi Chamber of Commerce telegraphed on the 18th of this month, stating that although the new stamp tax law has been discussed and finalized, it has not yet been promulgated. However, the stamp tax bureau has mostly adopted the new law for the penalty chapter, often sending those who are fined to court, causing repeated litigation burdens and business paralysis, which is very pitiful. Moreover, the old law's review committee has been resolutely abolished. It seems that the arbitrary use of both new and old laws has left merchants at a loss. The Chairman's meeting of this chamber on March 11th resolved that the Ministry of Finance should swiftly implement the new law to emphasize the decree and avoid harassment. We are specially telegraphing to convey this and hope for unanimous support. The case has been passed. It is found that the new stamp tax law, since it was resolved and passed by the Legislative Yuan, was promulgated by the National Government on December 8th of last year. However, the implementation method has not been drafted by your ministry, and the implementation date has not been determined and announced. In this transition between the new and old tax laws, as the chamber of commerce said, merchants really feel the pain of being at a loss. Merchants in this city also often have similar inquiries. We are submitting this to you in its entirety, hoping that your ministry will oversee and swiftly order the drafting and promulgation of detailed rules for the implementation of the new stamp tax law so that it can be followed, which would be very convenient for the public. Shanghai Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>The Yangtze Seven Shipping Company Cooperation League held a public sharing to increase freight rates and eliminate competition. This newspaper has reported on this business, and the companies have held many meetings. All public sharing drafts have also been drafted. However, the Yangtze River is a wide area with many ships, and cooperation cannot be achieved overnight. After the draft conditions have been decided upon by a joint meeting, they must be submitted to the Ministry of Transportation for approval before they can be implemented. Therefore, at 2:00 PM yesterday, the shipping companies convened another meeting at Jardine Matheson &amp; Co. Representatives from all seven companies were present. The content of the meeting cannot be disclosed, but it is heard that the scope of public sharing operations has been expanded. Because they are eager to realize this, the case will be actively pursued. It is planned to finalize the public sharing conditions first and then discuss them with various customs brokers.

<p>Li Yunmen, the director of the China Jisheng Society, and Zhenyou set off for Yixing to do relief work, which is being carried out with all their might. The society also sent investigators to various places to investigate the terrible disasters. According to reports, the counties of Cixi, Yuyao, and Zhenhai in eastern Zhejiang, which are known for their prosperity, have long spring days, and poor farmers cannot live for a day. The situation in Liyang, Jiangsu, is even worse. Those who are hungry and commit suicide by poison are not worth mentioning. There are also those who sell their daughters and children for a few yuan to temporarily survive. They cannot wait to be left in the ditches. Flesh and blood are separated, and the liver and intestines are broken. The cruelty is beyond words. These are all the tragic situations nearby. The Yellow River's destruction in the provinces of Yu, Gan, Xiang, and E, the burning, killing, and looting by bandits, and the drought and red land are even more terrible. I don't know how many times. At this time, when the Shanghai market is depressed and the scene is embarrassing, the society, which is the great duty of doing good, is calling for donations to solve the problem. With the sweat and blood of a few good groups, how much can there be? The voice is hoarse, and the water is exhausted, and the mountains are exhausted, which is already an unavoidable fact. Everyone thinks that in this period of emergency rescue, only public propaganda and ink appeals are the responsibility of the gentlemen of each newspaper. The compassionate and virtuous people at home and abroad all have the Buddhist and Confucian hearts to save the world. When the crucian carp in the dry rut is mourning and the wild geese are crying, when they cannot live and cannot die, the water of the West River and the millet of the overseer will live if they get it, and they will die if they don't get it. This is the time! Tears and pens don't know what to say.</p>

It was unanimously approved. It is now known that the League telegraphed the Geneva Women's Disarmament Committee yesterday, stating, "Living in this day and age, no one fails to feel that a second world war is about to break out. If war breaks out, major cities of all countries will be destroyed, and the lives and property of the people will be in constant danger. Humans are inherently rational; why can't this be seen? We women, whose nature is inherently peaceful, deeply feel the magnitude of past war disasters and are eager to work together to prevent them in advance. Considering that all humans share the same Earth, can sympathize with each other and have similar lives, without distinction of race or national boundaries, based on the teachings of the ancient sages of universal love and unity, we should all be compassionate and helpful, take fairness as the criterion, establish a permanent foundation for world peace, reduce military expenditures, open up sources of life for civilians, eliminate the heart of struggle, and bring the world to a harmonious state. This is the highest hope we share on this Women's Day and what we should strive for. We hereby convey our sincere hope, requesting your advocacy, relaying to the governments of various countries that with united will, the permanent peace of the world will be easily achieved."

<p>Liu Huadong, a native of Henan, was recently selling the narcotic "red pills" for profit at No. 24, Lane 309, Wuchang Road. He was investigated by Inspector Li Jingshou of the Hongkou Police Station, who, in cooperation with Chinese and foreign officers, secretly went to the address and arrested him, along with customers Ma Axing, Chu Aken, Shen [blank] Gou, and others, along with the red pills and smoking paraphernalia. They were taken to the police station and transferred to the First Special District Court. The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Wan Zhiyou requested that he be severely punished. He was ordered to be detained for sentencing. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi visited the Fourth Criminal Division and sentenced Liu Huadong to one year and six months of imprisonment.

<p>The Pudong Public Security Bureau recently received an anonymous letter from the post office, stating that Fan Yuzhang, a native of Siyang living at No. 41, Lane 69, Land Temple Street, Yangjiazhai, had acted lawlessly in his hometown, kidnapping people for ransom.

He was also involved in the murder of three people in the Bi Changping family in Xigengjiaqiao, Siyang County, and was wanted by the county. The letter requested his arrest and investigation. Director Zhang then secretly dispatched Captain Wang Shifu of the Detective Squad, leading detectives to wait and watch. The day before yesterday, late at night, Fan was arrested at the address. According to his confession, he was 31 years old, had been in Shanghai for two years, and had not committed any crimes. The director then ordered an investigation of the household registration book, which revealed that Fan indeed had one wife and one concubine each. However, whether he had committed any crimes was still unclear, so he was transferred to the General Bureau and a letter was sent to Siyang County to verify and investigate.</p>

<p>The rogue Ye Deliang, because the authorities strictly prohibit potent narcotics, such as opening narcotics agencies on land, is easily detected by the police. Recently, he came up with a novel idea, using a dilapidated Jiangbei boat to privately set up an opium den. Every day, he drifted on the Suzhou Creek near Old Bund, Gordon Road, etc. In addition to secretly selling red pill narcotics, he also set up opium couches for people to smoke. Unexpectedly, the City Public Security Bureau's Water Patrol Team learned of it the day before yesterday and immediately dispatched Inspector Pan Xiutong and Detective Cheng Xiqing, along with police officer Chen Zhirong, to take a patrol boat and rush to the Old Bund river surface at around 6 p.m., where they seized the narcotics boat. On the spot, they arrested eleven people, including locals Huang Ziyuan, Han Zixiang, Wang A'er, Zheng Dawanzi, Lu Sibao, Zhu Maodi, Wang Jinsheng, Xu Deming, Ye Deliang, etc., and seized nine opium pipes, nine opium lamps, and a large amount of red pill narcotics.

<p>The matter of Yao Jinping, a woman from Tianjin who transformed into a man, is not only considered strange by the general public, but also attracts great attention in the medical community. It is now known that Yao Jinping, accompanied by General Li Du, entered the National Shanghai Medical College at No. 362 Haig Road at 4:45 p.m. yesterday for a public examination. After Yao Jinping arrived at the hospital, she and Mr. Li were guided by the hospital staff to the dean's reception room on the second floor. Dean Yan received them and asked Yao Jinping about the process of her transformation into a man. Dean Yan also found it very strange. According to Dean Yan's conversation with General Li, if a woman has pseudohermaphroditism, she will gradually change, and there is no one who can complete the transformation overnight. At this point, he summoned Dr. Gao Rimei, director of the Urology and Reproductive Department, and Dr. Wang Yihui, director of the Obstetrics and Gynecology Department, to be responsible for a precise examination for authentication. However, because this examination is of great importance, it must be kept in the hospital for three days before it can be fully authenticated. With the consent of Mr. Li and Yao's grandparents, she was admitted to a first-class room No. 29. In order to reassure Yao Jinping, the hospital also sent female obstetrician Wu Huizhen to take care of her, and her grandfather Yao Qingpu also stayed in the hospital to accompany her. According to the two directors, Gao Rimei and Wang Yihui, they will first ask in detail about the process of her transsexualism tonight, or whether there are still hidden places, and then check each part for authentication. This authentication report can be published publicly three days later.</p>

<p>Zhao Shuchang, a Jiangbei salt merchant residing in a grass shed behind the Dingxin Yarn Factory in Caogadu, Shanghai, is 28 years old and works as a rickshaw puller. In December of last year, he was involved in the case of Guo Xinsheng, a Jiangbei native who was beaten to death, and was detained and transferred to the District Court for trial and acquitted. After returning home at the beginning of this month, his fellow villagers An Shijing and others suddenly took advantage of Zhao's acquittal and extorted ten yuan from Zhao on the pretext. Yesterday, An and others tried to extort money from Zhao again, but failed. They gathered Liu Ting [blank] and others, each holding weapons, and beat Zhao severely, causing serious injuries to his head, chest, and waist, with blood flowing like a river. The perpetrators then fled. Hu Luzhong, the police chief in charge of the police station, rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm, first took the injured to the hospital for treatment, and then detained An's wife Chen and Liu's father Liu Lianxi to the Caogadu Branch for investigation. Later, it was learned that Zhao's injuries were quite serious.</p>

<p>Wu Liesheng, an employee of the Telegraph Department of the Public Concession Police Department, is a Ningbo native, 33 years old, and lives at No. 59 Yuanjili, Tangshan Road, Hongkou. He has been working in the department for many years and is very capable, so he is deeply valued by the police department authorities. Last month, due to a nervous breakdown, he took leave for recuperation. After diagnosis and treatment, he has improved slightly. The morning before yesterday, Wu suddenly claimed that he wanted to visit friends in the police department. Fearing an accident, his family sent someone to accompany him. When they arrived at the entrance, Wu claimed that non-internal staff were not allowed upstairs, so he asked the person to wait outside, while he took the elevator up. [Blank] He did not come down for a long time. The person became suspicious and went upstairs to inquire, only to learn that he had left by another elevator. He immediately rushed home, but Wu had not returned. Fearing the worst, he urgently reported to the police station. Surprisingly, that night, Wu's wife received a call from Wu, stating that he did not want to ask about worldly affairs anymore and had decided to take the night train to Hangzhou to become a monk. After receiving the news, his family rushed to the station, but the night train had already left. They began to trace him to Hangzhou yesterday morning, but whether he actually went to Hangzhou is difficult to determine. Therefore, in addition to reporting to the police station and requesting a search, his family members hope that people from all walks of life will provide assistance, for which they will be extremely grateful. Mr. Wu is short, hunched over, has a disease in his right hand, and always holds a cane when walking.</p>

<h3 id="e142">Carelessness at Jinliyuan Wharf No. 14 Warehouse Last Night <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>At 9:10 last night, a fire broke out suddenly at Jinliyuan China Merchants Bureau No. 14 warehouse (located at the corner of Taiwan Road), No. 47 on the Bund of the French Concession. Nearby patrol officers discovered it and urgently reported to the police station to report to the fire department, which dispatched fire trucks to the rescue. At that time, the wind was very strong, the flames were soaring, and the fire was illuminating the sky. The firefighters all bravely rescued, but the warehouse was full of paper materials, and the downstairs was full of tung oil, all of which were flammable materials. Therefore, the fire continued to increase even after 11:30 p.m. Because the warehouse was surrounded by high walls, the fire broke through the roof, with very small portions of the flames, making the shooting difficult. All insurance companies sent personnel to investigate. The exact amount of loss is not yet estimated. The French Police Department specially sent Chinese and foreign detectives to take care of the scene. The trams on all routes to the 16th Pier were diverted when they reached the Xin Kai He Bund station. The cause of the fire is not easy to determine for a while. However, according to nearby merchants and neighbors, the Jinliyuan warehouse has a total of 20 new and old warehouses, and this is the 14th old warehouse, which has a history of more than 70 years. The warehouse originally belonged to Qichang Warehouse, and later transferred to China Merchants Bureau. In the past year, there have been rumors of reconstruction, but it has been delayed until now and no construction has been seen. The goods usually stored in the warehouse are mainly tung oil, paper, and medicinal materials. No one lives in the warehouse to watch it, and the goods are locked tightly after they are stored. Moreover, smoking is absolutely prohibited during the working hours of porters. Now it is suddenly burned, which is completely unexpected.</p>

<p>The Labor Movement Personnel Training Institute established by the Municipal Party Department of this city has been developing rapidly since its establishment. Daily life is very tense. Military management is implemented in the institute, and meals, accommodation, and internal affairs are all thoroughly militarized. Although the work is extremely heavy, the design of teaching and training is meticulous in all aspects, and the students' spirit is not boring or tired. Wu Xingya, the director, and Zhu Xuefan, the deputy director, are able to carry out all matters in the institute responsibly in accordance with the policies shown by the Municipal Party Department. Mr. Wu delivered a speech to all the labor movement personnel yesterday morning. The following is a record of his speech: (1) Regarding the principles of today's labor movement, Mr. Wu pointed out in detail the stages of the Kuomintang's labor policy in the past 15 years. He regretted that since the completion of the Northern Expedition, although the party has carried out the purification of the party and removed tangible communists, the toxins of intangible communism and theories still remain because the party has not yet sorted out its own theories to make them systematic and detailed, and because of the position of the workers themselves. Those who are ignorant of the facts and cling to abstract theories mistakenly believe that class struggle is the justice of labor movement theory. This is a very serious mistake and a very dangerous root cause. Regardless of whether the world revolution is still a fantasy today, and even if it is possible, the path to success cannot be the same everywhere. China has China's national conditions and environment. From a positive perspective, China today is in the stage of developing national capital. State-owned industries are necessary, but supporting private capital is also a strategy that should be adopted today. Today, China takes saving the poor and saving poverty as the primary task, and it is necessary to produce more and consume less, separate construction, and not destroy. It is even more necessary to combine the strength of the people of the whole country and the strength of the entire nation to seek success in things that are not successful. Dividing the strength of the people of the country and destroying the national united front is to hinder the strength of the country and hinder the restoration of the nation, and undoubtedly commits a major crime. Under the above premise, a policy of labor-capital coordination is naturally generated, and the correctness and rationality of the labor-capital coordination policy should naturally be recognized. However, in the process of national capital development, in order to prevent the abuses of communism, we must use the strongest political power and the strongest political power of partyization to gradually expand the power of state-owned industries and limit the power of private capital, so as not to violate the teachings of the General Manager and not violate the principles of the Three People's Principles. (2) Regarding personal cultivation, Mr. Wu earnestly warned the students that they must encourage themselves with the eight words "hard work, hard work, effort, and struggle", and pointed out that cultivation is not only in the passive personal aspect, but also in the active career aspect. The task of labor movement personnel is to seek welfare for the workers and to promote the progress of the country and society based on the party's doctrine and policies. Then, all matters that are beneficial to the workers, such as labor hygiene, labor education, cooperative undertakings, etc., must represent the demands of the workers and carry out reasonable propositions. Otherwise, it is to abandon the post, disloyal to the post, that is, a lack of virtue in cultivation. (Da Gong News Agency)</p>
<h3 id="e144">Heavy Fog This Morning, Northwest Wind Howled Last Night <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>The climate in this port is sometimes sunny and sometimes rainy, and the air pressure is low. This morning at dawn, a heavy fog suddenly dropped, and transportation on the water and land was mostly blocked. Seagoing vessels could not enter the port, and Shanghai-Hankou and Shanghai-Ping trains were forced to return. It was not until 10 a.m. that the clouds cleared and the fog dissipated, revealing a little sunlight. However, the weather was sunny and cloudy from time to time, and the weather was sultry. People in the city felt like they were wearing lined clothes. Last night, a northwest wind suddenly howled, and the temperature at one time differed by more than ten degrees from the morning, and there was drizzle, as if a summer storm was coming. According to the medical community, the climate is most uneven in spring throughout the year, with warm days and cool nights. If citizens are careless, they will get sick, especially because all diseases break out in spring. At this time, citizens should wear more clothes to avoid being invaded by illness.</p>
<h3 id="e145">Robbery of French Businessmen's Water and Electricity Company; A Large Number of Bandits Sent to Court for Trial; The Case is Complicated Because There Are Many Criminals and Must Be Rescheduled for Detailed Investigation <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>The French tram company, at 11 a.m. on February 30, was robbed of a bag of 4,000 yuan in cash in front of the company. After the case occurred, the French police sent detectives to investigate strictly. It was not until 9 p.m. on the 17th of this month that Jin Jiulin, the superintendent of the special agency of the French police department, led detective Zhang Ziying and the patrol officers of the general team, together with the police detectives of the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau, first arrested the bandit Qiu Yanshou (24 years old, Funing native) in the opium den at No. 29 Dafang Lane, Fangbang Bridge. According to Qiu's confession, the gang members Yang Yang, Li Zhongxin, Zhu Hanqiang, Qiang Yunpeng, Pan Yuqing, Liu Shaogen, Zhang Debiao, Zhao Zhongheng, Xu Shaogen, Fan Youheng, and Pan Xiangbang were successively arrested in the pavilion room at No. 30 Anshun Lane, Kangti Road, French Concession, and in rooms 8 and 14 of the Xin Dafang Hotel, No. 381 Edward Road. According to the confessions of Yang and others, Zhou Kui and Zhou Lu, a couple, were subsequently arrested on the floor of No. 34 Derun Lane, Chezhan Road, Nanshi, and two pistols and sixteen bullets were seized. Xia Wenfu and Xu Yuecheng were subsequently arrested at No. 480 Fangxie Road. The five people Qiu, Zhou, Xia, Xu, and Lu, who were arrested in the Chinese Concession, along with the pistols and bullets, were sent to the Public Security Bureau for detention. In total, sixteen men and women of the bandit party were arrested. The details of each case were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, the police station first sent the eleven bandits arrested in the French Concession to the First Criminal Court of the Second Special District. Judge Sun Penghang conducted a preliminary trial, first questioning the names, ages, addresses, and occupations of the bandits. Then, Gu Shouxi, a lawyer from the police station, stated the case and the process of arresting the defendants, and said that there were many criminals in this case and the case was complicated. He requested a rescheduling of the case for a week in order to conduct a detailed investigation. There were also five men and women bandits and pistols detained at the Public Security Bureau, and he requested that the court send a document to transfer them for joint interrogation before filing a lawsuit. The court approved the report and decided to reschedule the hearing to April 1 to investigate and retry. The defendants were still detained.</p>
<h3 id="e146">The Case of Hu Wang, a Young Woman, Accusing Hu Yunfei of Bigamy is Concluded; Sentencing is Scheduled for the Morning of the 23rd <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>Hu Wang, a young woman from Xuyi, Anhui, is 27 years old this year. She hired a lawyer to submit a complaint to the Criminal Court of the Second Special District, accusing her cousin Hu Yunfei, the owner of the Sino-American Department Store at No. 543-545 Fada Road, of bigamy and abandonment. They married on November 16, 1934, and lived together at No. 30 Sandeli, Wansheng Bridge, Ximen, with Zhang Wanyi and Qiu Zhongshan as matchmakers. Recently, Hu suddenly abandoned her and married another woman, Yang Suxin, and has lived together for three years. Unable to bear the hardship, she requested an investigation. After several hearings, the court ruled that because both parties had spousal relationships, it did not meet the self-litigation procedure, and the judgment was rejected. Hu Wang was unwilling to accept the judgment and filed a complaint with the court, requesting that the French police station investigate and file a public prosecution. The police station summoned both parties for questioning and sent detectives on the 14th of this month to [blank], where the police department's lawyer filed a public prosecution for abandonment under Article 310 of the French Criminal Code. Judge Sun Penghang tried the case, but the defendant Hu Yunfei did not arrive, and the court ordered a rescheduling for another trial. The details of each case have been recorded in previous reports. Yesterday was the date for a continued hearing. The defendant arrived with his defense lawyer. First, the plaintiff Hu Wang stated the process of marrying the defendant and being abandoned, and hired a lawyer to file an incidental private lawsuit, claiming that the plaintiff Hu Wang's left eye was blind, and requested that she be given alimony of 20 yuan per month until she was 60 years old, totaling 8,160 yuan. She also claimed that all the evidence had been submitted in the self-litigation case and requested that the case file No. 109 of the 23rd year be inspected. When questioned, the defendant Hu Yunfei denied that he had married or abandoned the plaintiff. He said that his younger sister had died of illness, and his mother was sad, so her mother sent her to his mother as a daughter. Although there had been talk of betrothing her to him as his wife, he did not agree, so it was not carried out. She had been in his mother's house. Last winter, she suddenly went out to hire a lawyer and falsely accused him of bigamy and abandonment, and demanded a lot of money. Because he did not agree, he fabricated accusations. He asked the court to investigate. The court then summoned witnesses Zhang Wanyi and Qiu Zhongshan to the court. After they took an oath, Zhang and Qiu both testified that they had never been matchmakers for both parties. Finally, after the police department's lawyer, the private prosecution agent, and the defendant's defense lawyer debated one by one, the court ordered the debate to be concluded and scheduled the sentencing for 10 a.m. on the 23rd.</p>
<h3 id="e147">General Manager of Nanyang Tobacco Company, Jian Yujie, Accused by Workers <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Jian Yujie, the Cantonese general manager of Nanyang Tobacco Company, and Feng Jiaxiang, the director of the tobacco leaf department, were jointly accused by Ding Xinglong, a worker in the tobacco cutting department, and hired two lawyers, Yu Xiangqin and Li Baosen, to file a complaint with the First Special Court, accusing Jian of instigating Feng and others to jointly beat them, causing serious injuries. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao visited the Fifth Criminal Court for trial. Except for Xu Wenlong, who did not arrive, all the defendants arrived and hired lawyer Qin Liankui to defend them. The plaintiff Ding Xinglong claimed that he lived at No. 262 Nanxingli, Baoding Road, and was a worker in the tobacco cutting department of Nanyang Tobacco Company. This time, the company's employee incentive system, which was established in 1931, concerned the issue of bonus custody. At that time, it was agreed that the company and the workers would each elect a custodian to jointly manage the bonuses. Surprisingly, for two years, it has not been implemented. The workers felt that their rights were involved, so on the 25th of last month, they elected 17 representatives to petition General Manager Jian, requesting that the previous agreement on bonus custody be fulfilled. Unexpectedly, General Manager Jian not only refused, but also fired all 17 representatives. At that time, all the workers were indignant when they heard the news, so on the afternoon of the 2nd of this month, they temporarily and spontaneously went on strike for one hour, and requested the factory to quickly reinstate the 17 fired workers. At that time, Feng Jiaxiang, the director of the tobacco leaf department, came and claimed that he had been ordered by General Manager Jian to prohibit the shutdown of the vehicles, and showed a pistol, ordering foremen Zhu Ahua, Xiaogong Xu Wenlong, etc., to wield iron bars and beat me arbitrarily, with fists and feet, causing me serious injuries. I had already gone to the procuratorate of the court on the 4th of this month to have my injuries examined. When questioned, the defendant Jian Yujie stated that he was not aware of the beating. Feng Jiaxiang also stated that he did not beat him. The plaintiff Ding Xinglong instructed the workers to stop the vehicles on that day. The foreman reported it, and I went out to maintain order and prohibited the vehicles from stopping. At that time, the police detectives also came out and arrested Ding Jiang. Zhu Ahua also denied beating him. After Judge Ye verified the confession, he ordered the case to be rescheduled for trial at 2 p.m. on the 26th.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Zou Xiuying's Appeal Points Out that the Judge Has a Problem; The Higher Court Considers it an Insult to Officials and Will Investigate; Jiang Gongjian Arrives in Court to Testify, Yang Ming Fails to Appear Despite Summons <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Zou Xiuying, a woman from Wuxi, previously filed a case against lawyer Jiang Gongjian for insulting and falsely accusing her in the First Special District Court. After several hearings by Judge Liu Yugui, the result was that both parties were found not guilty. Both parties refused to accept the verdict and appealed to the Second Higher Branch Court. However, in Zou Xiuying's appeal, she pointed out that the original trial judge had a comradeship with Jiang Gongjian and colluded behind the scenes. After reading it, the prosecutor's office of the First Special District Court believed that Zou Xiuying and Zou's drafter of the complaint, Ta Ming (namely Yang Shaobai), had insulted officials and obstructed public affairs. Therefore, Prosecutor Guo Wei conducted an investigation and issued a summons to Zou and Yang to appear in the Fourteenth Court this morning for interrogation, and Jiang Gongjian was also summoned to testify. At that time, only Zou arrived in court. Yang Ming failed to appear despite the summons. First, Mr. Guo asked Jiang Gongjian about what happened, and then questioned Zou Xiuying. Zou stated that she entrusted Yang Ming to draft the appeal. Yang did not have a fixed address and lived in a hotel all day, so he could not be found today. The court then ordered the case to be rescheduled for trial and ordered Zou to invite Yang Ming to the court at the next hearing, otherwise, she would issue an arrest warrant and adjourn the court.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Wang Xiaolai Publishes Remarks: Impressions of Visiting the Philippines and Opinions on Aiding the Market <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>After returning from his tour of the Philippines, Mr. Wang Xiaolai, Speaker of the Municipal Council, has been extremely busy these past few days contacting various parties due to the emergence of the market relief problem. A reporter from Xin Sheng News Agency specifically visited him yesterday to inquire about Mr. Wang's impressions of his visit to the Philippines and his opinions on market relief. He graciously presented the following:</p>
<p>Impressions of the Trip to the Philippines</p>
<p>The delegation to the Philippines included members from the business sector, the education sector, and various other fields. Therefore, we were able to observe from multiple perspectives and gain diverse insights. The daily itinerary in the Philippines has already been reported in various newspapers, so I won't go into further detail. On the second day in the Philippines, we visited coconut oil factories, cigar factories, and ice cream factories. The equipment in each factory was very complete, with capital exceeding ten million. Wages were at least sixty cents a day, and up to one or two dollars. Working hours were nine hours. The cost of living for workers in the Philippines is only about twenty cents a day, so they can often work hard for a few days and then rest for one or two days, without the hardship of overexertion. There are about eight or nine gold mines in the area. We also visited one of the largest, with a mine extending 10,000 feet horizontally and 100 feet deep per layer, totaling 1,100 feet. After donning the miner's clothes, we descended directly by elevator. This mine can produce forty to fifty million in gold annually. The company's capital is six million pesos (Philippine currency). A 1,000-peso share from twenty years ago can now yield a profit of 500,000 yuan, truly a case of small investment yielding great return. Furthermore, the Philippine Chamber of Commerce invited the Chinese Chamber of Commerce and leaders from various industries to a meeting on March 2nd. The most important points resulting from the discussion were six: (1) Tariffs: Goods shipped from China face higher tariffs, making it difficult to compete with other goods. (2) Transportation: The United States and Japan both have their own commercial vessels for transportation, but Chinese merchants have no overseas shipping industry and are often subject to restrictions. (3) Finance: Previously, one Philippine peso could be exchanged for 1.7 taels of silver in China, equivalent to more than one yuan. Now, it is only worth one yuan and a few cents. The sharp drop in exchange rates significantly affects the value of goods. Therefore, exchange rates are a major problem for Chinese goods exported to the Philippines. (4) Goods: The failure of Chinese goods to adapt to demand is a major reason for the failure of foreign trade, and improvements are urgently needed. (5) Organization: Commercial organizations at home and abroad have failed to connect as much as possible. Even within the business community in one place, there is a lack of unity. Furthermore, the government has not been able to fulfill its responsibility to protect commerce, so command and assembly feel quite scattered. Finally, aviation issues were also discussed. While in the Philippines, I also visited the aviation industry. Various aircraft are striving for innovation, while China cannot even obtain them. Therefore, I immediately used this idea to assist the overseas Chinese in the Philippines to work together in aviation and save the country. The overseas Chinese were deeply moved. The school's cleanliness and newspaper offices were inspected by Mr. Pan Gongzhan and others, and there is a separate report. This meeting achieved considerable results in Sino-Philippine commerce. It was immediately decided to organize the China-Philippine Commercial Advancement Association, with six representatives from the Philippine Chinese Chamber of Commerce and six from the Shanghai business community, totaling twelve people, to engage in preparations, as a future mechanism for promoting trade between China and the Philippines. The Philippine prisons were also visited. Men and women are held separately, the former in prisons and the latter in reformatories. The architecture is also special, with four hundred walls surrounding a dusty wall, with paths on the walls, like the battlements of a Chinese city. Therefore, everything in the prison is visible from the walls. While visiting the prison, I observed military drills and music, rigorous and solemn, which I had never seen before. The training of prisoners is like this, and one can imagine other things. The climate in the Philippines is hotter, especially in March and April. Now it is already the summer vacation. When we were there, the temperature was above eighty degrees. The average annual temperature is about seventy degrees. The Carnival is usually held in February. It is said that the Philippine Autonomous Region will be established in mid-January next year, and an Expo will be held at that time. The Carnival will also be held earlier. Our country should participate and set up a Chinese pavilion. This matter should be suggested to the government. The roads in the Philippines are very wide. Except for the marketplace, which is a bit narrow, the usual width is two or three times that of Shanghai, and cars often run three to five abreast, and their number is also very large. Even the scenic summer resort, Baguio Mountain, which is 5,000 feet high, has very flat roads. It takes three hours to drive around by car, like speeding in a large garden, surrounded by mountains, the beauty of the scenery is breathtaking, and the climate is also good, with flowers and trees blooming in all seasons. From Manila, first take a five-hour train, with air conditioning installed, then change to a two-hour car ride up the mountain. The road is lined with coconut and banana trees, which are pleasing to the eye. In addition, the cold waterfalls in the northern mountains are also interesting. Although the waterfalls are not large, they are in a steep cliff, like sitting at the bottom of a well, making people feel the majesty of nature. Those who compete in the arena now feel infinite shame. Chinese people in the Philippines account for about one-tenth of the total Philippine population. If we talk about those with blood relations, it is more than half. Over the years, the relationship between Chinese and Filipinos has been very harmonious. Other customs are simple and frugal. Women also work hard. Heavy objects are carried on the head, without carrying them on the shoulders or in their hands. They can be called strong. In short, in addition to initiating the organization of the China-Philippine Commercial Advancement Association and promoting aviation to save the country, I deeply feel that our country still needs to make progress in construction. In the Philippines, even uninhabited places have very flat roads, while we have densely populated areas but no roads to pass through. They have roads on the mountains, while we cannot even travel on the plains. Also, in terms of planting trees, the forests in the Philippines are very developed, and the trunks are very large and straight, while many Chinese people have hunched backs. Comparing the two, how can we not be ashamed? After leaving the Philippines, I went to Guangzhou to visit the sugar factory. The scale is grand, using sugarcane from Guangdong as the raw material for sugar production. It is said that after the entire plan is successful, it can supply the whole of China and recover tens of millions of yuan in losses. In addition, the power plant, water plant, fertilizer plant, cement plant, sulfuric acid plant, textile plant, various departments for dividing wool, cotton, and silk, and various dyeing plants were visited with the secretary of the Construction Department. Compared to the one cement factory I visited in Guangdong and Guangxi during the Republic of China in 1926, there has been great progress. Commander-in-Chief Chen Jitang governed Guangdong for six years. As a military strategist, he also has political acumen and economic thinking. It is said that the various factories currently being run are all promoted by the government and have been effective. Then, they are made public to the people. Currently, 15% of Guangdong Province's revenue is used to support industry, demarcate factory areas, and gradually expand. If they can persevere, Guangzhou can also become a major industrial zone. Mining is also underway. When I arrived in Guangzhou, I also visited the Sun Yat-sen Memorial Hall, which is magnificent and can be compared with the Temple of Heaven. At Huanghuagang, I presented a wreath. At the same time, Mr. Liu Yazi, who went from the Philippines to Guangdong, composed more than two hundred poems, which can be used as a reference for this trip. Hong Kong now prohibits prostitution, which will be completely eradicated by the end of June. The market is also very sluggish, and so on.</p>
<p>Opinions on Market Relief</p>
<p>I believe that revitalizing the market is an active action, while relieving the market is a passive approach. To talk about revitalization, the government must encourage domestic goods, and the people must use domestic goods. Otherwise, everything else is not fundamental. As for relief, it should be the responsibility of the government, and silver and money businesses can only assist. After all, silver and money businesses are one of the hundred industries, and their purpose is to operate, not like the government, which should stand in the position of protecting the people. Now, the five million industrial and commercial credit small loan has a chance to succeed, to meet the urgent need. It is hoped that the government will quickly allocate funds to complete this task. As for handling procedures, I think it can be divided into three types. The first type is to support the development of industry and commerce, like a person who is weak and needs nourishment. The second type is to lift industry and commerce out of poverty, like a person who is sick and lying in bed, taking medicine to get up and give him a chance to recover his health. The third type is to seek a good end for industry and commerce, like a person whose illness is hopeless, and to prevent it from spreading. If we can handle things carefully according to this standard, the market will be able to operate. However, industry and commerce should also keep pace with the times. If they stick to old rules, there is no hope of revitalizing the market. Therefore, we should take this opportunity to improve the organization, employ specialized talents, implement scientific management, and then provide relief. Then, there is hope for the recovery of chronic diseases. It's like life. External needles and bait must echo the individual's own training, and then can it be fully effective. If we talk about the present, I hope that government relief, silver and money business assistance, and industrial and commercial businesses receiving assistance can work together to overcome difficulties. Only then can it be effective. For fundamental relief, there must be a sound organization, and then we can talk about the control of various industries. Without control, there is not enough to talk about the entire plan.</p>
<h3 id="e150">Wan Shen Pig Shop Manager Returns to Shanghai Safely After Escaping Recently. Demanded a Ransom of 100,000 Yuan and Was Imprisoned Tightly When Initially Kidnapped. Endured Great Hardship for More Than Half a Year. <a href="#e150" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c150" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">150</a></h3>
<p>Wan Shen Fresh Pig Shop in Wusong is the first to open in the Song area, with the oldest brand and prosperous business. It has a Wan Shen branch in Yangjing Town, Pudong, Shanghai. The general manager, Xu Hongjun, is over fifty years old and from Ningbo. Due to business relations, he often went to the Huaibei area to buy live pigs (commonly known as Huai pigs) and transport them to Song for the market. In August last year, Xu went to Huaibei to buy pigs again. He encountered bandits in the countryside near Taoyuan Suqian above Yangzhou and was kidnapped. The bandits then sent a letter to Li Shen Xing, demanding a ransom of 100,000 yuan. However, although Xu has been the manager for many years, he loves alcohol and has large household expenses, so he has no savings. In addition, the bandits demanded too much, so Xu's family had no way to raise such a large amount of money and had to ignore it. However, Xu has been kidnapped for half a year, and the news has been very quiet recently. Unexpectedly, the kidnapped manager Xu suddenly escaped from the bandit's den the other day and returned to Shanghai safely. The shop's employees were overjoyed to see the manager suddenly return. After inquiring, it was learned that he had escaped while the bandits were not paying attention, which was fortunate. According to Mr. Xu, he suffered a lot in the bandit's den, which is hard to describe. At first, the bandits thought I was a wealthy man and demanded 100,000 yuan. The surveillance was tight. Even the sound of a cough was not allowed to be loud, otherwise, beatings would be imminent. The food was very poor and difficult to swallow. The bed board was only two feet wide, and I had to sleep with two bandits, so my body was full of lice. Recently, the bandits found out that I was not rich, and it had been a long time, so the bandits were gradually relaxed, and I was able to take the opportunity to escape, which was a great fortune.</p>
<h3 id="e151">Xin Tai Shun Ship Collides with Lin Xing Small Boat. Huang Helou Tragically Drowns. Laborers Attempt to Retrieve the Body. <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Lin Xing, a small towing barge of the Songhu Maoxing Company, sailed to the Duck Nest sand sea off the Sanjia Water mouth of Wusong at about 10 p.m. on the 14th of this month, intending to tow a timber ship from Fujian to Shanghai. At the same time, another towing barge, Xin Shuntai, also happened to be sailing. In order to compete for the towing production, both sides opened their speed and rushed forward. When they were about to reach the timber ship, the Lin Xing ship was unexpectedly hit violently by the Xin Shuntai ship, so the Lin Xing ship sank immediately, and all the people on board fell into the water. They were rescued one after another, but Huang Helou (30 years old, from Xiaoshan, Zhejiang) tragically drowned, and his body was nowhere to be found. After the accident, the Zhang Huabang Customs River Department detained the Xin Shuntai towing barge that caused the accident. At the same time, the water patrol team arrested Wang Peigen, the captain of Xin Shuntai, and Chen Xiaomao. and other three people were arrested and transferred to the local court for trial yesterday. Prosecutor Du Jiasheng interrogated them and ordered them to be detained for further investigation. It is also heard that Maoxing Company hired lawyer Wang Peiyuan to file a complaint with the court, demanding that the Xin Shuntai ship owner Chen Maojian compensate for the ship's loss of 5,000 taels of silver. In addition, the family of the deceased Huang Helou filed a petition for condolences. On the one hand, the company hired workers for several days to try to salvage Huang's body around the scene of the accident.</p>

<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that for several years, a portion of the city's street lights has used domestic Aipu'er brand light bulbs, while another portion still uses foreign light bulbs due to contracts. This year, the municipal authorities have decided to use all domestic light bulbs for aesthetic reasons. Therefore, various domestic light bulbs were collected and subjected to precise testing. As a result, the Aipu'er brand still ranked first. The municipal government has recently ordered light bulbs for all street lights from the China Aipu'er Electrical Appliance Factory. It is reported that the contract was signed last week by Mr. Hu Xiyuan, General Manager of the Aipu'er Factory, and Mr. Xu Peihuang, Director of the Municipal Public Works Bureau, at the Municipal Government Public Works Bureau. From now on, all street lights in the city will use domestic light bulbs, which is the most gratifying thing for citizens.</p>

<h3 id="e154">Xin Tai Kang Grocery Store: The Landlady Fang Dan Was Deceived. <a href="#e154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>A Reckless Accountant Insisted on Sleeping Together.</p>
<p>Xin Tai Kang Grocery Store at No. 450, the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Saiposai in the French Concession, has been open for eight years and has a fairly developed business. The landlady, Mrs. Cao Liu from Shanghai, is 39 years old and has a son and a daughter. The son's name is Guan Xin, who is 14 years old, and the daughter's name is Gendi, who is 18 years old. Because Lao Guan, Cao Haisong from Shanghai, passed away many years ago, no one takes care of the store and the residence. Therefore, Ji Heshang, a fellow villager (54 years old), was hired as an accountant to take care of everything and lived with his wife in the same house. Before, Mrs. Cao Liu urgently needed to exchange Fang Dan. The accountant Ji Heshang claimed to have acquaintances in the Land Bureau. Therefore, he entrusted the accountant to exchange the Land Certificate for one piece of Fang Dan paper and two pieces of grain string paper. Unexpectedly, after a long time, he did not hand it over. On the 19th of the lunar new year, he asked the accountant to return it, but he was beaten by Cao Liu, and he was taken to Renji Hospital for treatment by car. On February 20, he went to the country. The accountant posted a red paper on the door, because there was an important event at home, and the business was temporarily suspended for a few days. It has not opened yet. Mrs. Cao Liu has now hired lawyer Chao Kun to file a private prosecution with the Second Special District Court according to law. The lawsuit is in progress. Ji Heshang dismantled the wall in the room, because Mrs. Cao Liu's room was separated from the accountant's room by a board, hoping to falsely accuse him of knowing Mrs. Cao Liu. He insisted on sleeping in the same room.</p>

<p>Since Mr. Chen Xiaodie, a man of letters, has been engaged in industry and commerce, he has spared no effort in his efforts. All products are constantly updated and improved to meet the actual needs of society. Recently, in addition to joining hands with Mr. Weng Rongbing to create the Invincible Brand Soap Factory on Jiangwan Road, which opened on the 8th of this month and added a different color to domestic soap, he also joined hands with Dr. Tang Jia, a medical doctor, to create a large-scale Kangle Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory on Huishan Road. It is said that its purpose is that Western medicine imports reach tens of millions of redundancies every year, and the leakage is huge. Now, there are many rising stars in the domestic new pharmaceutical industry, but little attention is paid to raw material drugs. Therefore, the factory was specially set up to engage in manufacturing. Moreover, Dr. Tang Jiazhen has served in Peking Union Medical College for many years and has served as the Qingdao International Sanatorium, the Municipal Hospital, and the local Family Medicine Association. His knowledge and experience are very rich, and he is especially proficient in smoking cessation. Countless celebrities in Shanghai have quit smoking under his guidance. Therefore, since the factory was first established, it has started with the latest invented raw material for smoking cessation, "Egg Yolk Su", named "Kangle Su 1", which will be on sale soon. The testing was successful. Various raw material drugs, etc., are being manufactured in succession, all of which are pioneering innovations in my country's new pharmaceutical industry. The establishment of the factory can not only recover huge losses, but also benefit society deeply. It is said that the official opening will be around April this year.</p>

<p>The 35th Shanghai Youth Association Solicitation Fair closed on the 17th. Those present that day were all Shanghai youth leaders, in high spirits and full of energy. The chief captain of the general team, Minister Kong Yongzhi, attended as chairman and gave an encouraging speech. As a result, each team was very aggressive. This afternoon at 6:00 PM is the time for the first announcement. Yesterday, the chief captain sent letters to each team leader urging them to submit their scores. Judging from the current situation, the association's solicitation this time, with the assistance of all parties, is sure to succeed. As for the leaders who made donations and the members of the solicitation committee, they also sent out donation booklets yesterday, and the chief captain sent letters to each leader with unusually sincere wording. Here is the original letter: Esteemed Sirs, The Shanghai Youth Association has been established for 35 years, and all its activities have been supported by you. This year, the 35th Solicitation Fair of the Association opened on March 17 and will end on April 10. The appointed committee members are aware of this. The Association promotes social education and has made many contributions to young people in society, which is why it has such a long history and large scale. Its necessity to society is self-evident. However, the Association has no endowment, and its expenses rely solely on the annual donations from all sectors through the Solicitation Fair. In recent years, the social situation has been poor, and the Association's finances have also been affected. However, the Association is an organization that serves society, and people in society should share the responsibility of supporting it. The reason why I reluctantly serve as the chief captain this time is also for this purpose. I hope that all sectors will uphold this principle and do their best to maintain it. I am enclosing a donation booklet and respectfully request your strong support. The youth will be endlessly grateful. Also enclosed are a 35th Anniversary Commemorative Booklet of the Association and an issue of the Shanghai Youth Weekly. (The organization and list of the Solicitation Fair are attached in the Shanghai Youth Magazine). Please accept them. I respectfully await your reply and wish you well. Sincerely, Kong Xiangxi, Chief Captain of the 35th Solicitation Fair.</p>

Therefore, he invited more than ten core members of the light bulb industry, including Chen Zinan, Li Qingxiang, Xia Yingde, and Ying Kui, to jointly initiate the organization of the China Electric Light Bulb Reorganization Company, with a temporarily fixed capital of 100,000 yuan. Detailed regulations have been formulated regarding the raw material procurement, manufacturing, and sales of each electric light bulb factory, with a comprehensive reorganization plan.

<p>(4) Unemployment and Bankruptcies: If we examine non-gold standard countries, the unemployment and bankruptcy statistics since 1932 show a consistent downward trend except for Canada. This is in contrast to the phenomenon in gold standard countries and is sufficient to illustrate the improvement in social and economic conditions. For example, in the late 1932 and early 1933, the most serious period of unemployment in the United States, the estimated number of unemployed people reached over 13.6 million. The highest unemployment rate reached 35%. Subsequently, with the government's efforts, it gradually decreased. By June 1933, the unemployment rate had dropped to 31%. In 1934, the average unemployment rate was 26%, and the number of unemployed people was less than 10 million.</p>

<p>The First Special Court's Trial Concluded Yesterday, with a Sentence Scheduled for the 23rd of This Month</p>
<p>Li Kangbo, from Shandong, works as a customs broker in the French Concession. His wife has always lived in his hometown. Li, unable to endure the loneliness of being away from home, became acquainted with Li Laosan, a prostitute in a brothel. They rented a place at No. 226 Chongqing Road, Xinzha. Laosan knew that he was wrong, but Kangbo was only 37 years old, and the age difference was more than ten years, so Kangbo was naturally dissatisfied. Therefore, he continued to visit brothels, seeking beauties to relieve his sexual boredom and fully satisfy his desires. He met a prostitute named Zhong Sanyuan in Qunyu Fang Brothel last summer. She was only 29 years old, petite and clever, and Kangbo admired her greatly. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, he spent more than 3,000 yuan to redeem her and hid her in Chongqing Road, living with Laosan. The two had similar backgrounds and should have gotten along, but although Yin and Xing did not avoid each other, the mistress and concubine could not live in peace. Sanyuan suddenly left on December 25 of the lunar calendar and lived with her father, Zhong Degui. She then hired a lawyer to send a letter to Li Kangbo, declaring that she would permanently sever the relationship. Li lost both his money and his love. The next day, he reported to the Chengdu Road police station, saying that Sanyuan had taken gold and diamond jewelry and fur coats worth several hundred yuan and fled. He then hired a lawyer to file a criminal self-accusation against Zhong Sanyuan and Zhong Degui for disrupting the family and stealing clothes and jewelry. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Liu Yugui of the First Special District Local Court opened a trial. Li Kangbo first stated that he suffered from a throat ailment and was afraid to speak. The facts of the accusation were already listed in the complaint, and he asked his lawyer to present the case. He then briefly described the process, saying that he had taken Sanyuan as a concubine on August 16 of the lunar calendar last year, but she suddenly took clothes and jewelry and fled on December 25. Neighbors had seen Sanyuan carrying a package of clothes out the door and handing it to her father, Zhong Degui, to take away. He now demanded that Sanyuan return home and return the clothes and jewelry she had taken, etc. However, according to Zhong Sanyuan's statement, she was deceived by Li to his home last Mid-Autumn Festival. Li said that he had no wife, but in fact, Li had a wife in his hometown, and there was also a mistress, Laosan, in Shanghai, so she refused to be Li's concubine. However, because she was closely monitored by him, she could not escape. Until December 25, she felt unbearable to be abused by Laosan, and Laosan even issued an eviction order. She took the opportunity to return to her mother's home alone and did not take anything. Counting the four months she lived with Li, Li did not give her a single piece of clothing or jewelry. Li was at home and saw her leave. If she had taken something, why didn't he report it to the police that day, and only accused her of theft after she hired a lawyer to formally notify him, etc. Zhong Degui also stated that his daughter was originally in a brothel. It was not until midnight on December 25 that his daughter suddenly returned home and cried about being deceived by Li Kangbo. Only then did he know that his daughter had lived with Li. His daughter was not yet an adult, so he even planned to accuse Li of enticing an underage girl to leave her family. After the lawyers of both parties argued, Judge Liu instructed them to wait for the sentence on the 23rd of this month.</p>

<p>Students Participate Freely</p>
<p>Regarding the case of requesting the inclusion of the Boy Scouts as a required subject in elementary schools, the Ministry of Education replied to the China Boy Scouts General Association on November 10 last year, stating that the case was approved, and the Nanjing Special City Council requested that the elementary school senior grades' preliminary scout curriculum be included as a required subject. After review, most elementary school students are from poor families, and it is not easy to bear the various expenses of the Boy Scouts, and there are many subjects, which are difficult to balance in terms of intelligence. Students should still join voluntarily. Recently, the China Boy Scout General Association, based on the resolutions of the council, requested the Ministry of Education to include the young Boy Scouts in the elementary school required curriculum. According to the news from the Ministry of Education, this matter is still based on the actual situation of elementary school students (such as the difficulty of bearing the burden due to poverty and the difficulty of balancing intelligence, etc.), so the Boy Scouts are not listed as a required subject in elementary schools, and students are free to join.</p>

<h3 id="e198">National Central University Relocates Expenses to Be Listed Next Year <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>The National Government recently issued orders to the Executive Yuan, the Control Yuan, and the Accounting Office of the government, stating that the case was approved by the Central Political Conference on March 8, 1935. The case was approved by the government and transferred to the National Central University for the estimate of continuing expenses for the construction outside the suburbs. After being submitted to the Finance Group for review, it was reported that the required continuing expenses for this case were originally submitted by Note Committee Member Zhao Ming and others and resolved in principle at the fourth plenary meeting, and the Executive Yuan was responsible for handling it appropriately. However, the competent authorities did not submit a report on the handling situation. At the 420th political meeting, Committee Member Luo Jialun requested a discussion and resolved that the Executive Yuan should still implement it this year. The competent authorities then submitted a full-year estimate of 960,000 yuan in accordance with the resolution. The government's accounting office reviewed and believed that the submission was late and proposed to change it to six months and 480,000 yuan to be approved from January 1935. After reviewing that the principles of this case were passed by the plenary meeting, and the starting period was also resolved by this meeting to be this year, it seems that there is no problem in approving the listing of these continuing expenses from this year. However, since it was not included in the national general estimate for this year and needs to be paid from the national first reserve fund, there was another 431st political meeting resolution after the 420th meeting on the payment of the second reserve fund, stating that new facilities should be limited to those that cannot be delayed this year. It was not stated whether this case cannot be delayed, and the remaining balance of the second reserve fund is already less than 480,000 yuan, with more than four months left until the end of the year, and it is difficult to guarantee that there are no expenses that cannot be delayed and must be paid. Moreover, once this continuing expense begins, it is inconvenient to stop it midway. It seems that it should be temporarily postponed this year, and the competent (education) department should list it in the 24th-year estimate in accordance with the case. After review, the 447th meeting of this conference resolved to pass it in accordance with the review opinions. Correspondingly, the case was recorded and sent to Yuan Qing to review and transfer the order. It should be handled accordingly except for the reply and the division of the lines. He ordered the college (or Yuan Zhuan) to forward the review to the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Education for compliance.</p>

<p>"Happiness" must be sought from pain, otherwise, what is obtained is only superficial; because without the vast sea, there is no lofty mountain. In times of extreme joy, one will definitely open one's mouth wide and "haha..." laugh, but when it is really unavoidable, one can also show a smile, but this is a terrible bitter smile!</p>
<p>People all look forward to happiness, but do not know that the object of happiness is suffering. As a result, those who yearn often fall into the net of sorrow.</p>
<h3 id="e209">No Taboos <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Master of the Yiyi Studio</p>
<p>In the old-fashioned families of our China, nine out of ten homes have a red paper, ink-printed slip of paper pasted on the walls, even on the door jambs of the front and back doors, with floral patterns around it. This is called "No Taboos."</p>
<p>Naturally, the meaning of "No Taboos" is because our China is a country that advocates "superstition." Every action, every smile, has "superstitious" taboos. Ordinary "clever people" (?) devised this "No Taboos" gadget to avoid trouble, simply to indicate that there are no taboos on anything. If one family does this, and everyone does this, thinking about it carefully, how can we blame the Chinese people for putting on "No Taboos" performances everywhere to satisfy the curiosity of foreigners?</p>
<p>For example, on the walls of every lane on the road, it is clearly written "Urination Prohibited Here." However, right under the words "Prohibited from Urinating," there is a large yellow stain of urine, forcing you to cover your nose and pass by! This is the achievement of our Chinese people performing under "No Taboos."</p>
<p>For example, on boats, cars, or in public places, it is clearly marked "No Spitting." However, even with the words, phlegm and snot are still "spit everywhere!" For example, Mr. A feels an itch in his throat, then coughs, followed by a mouthful of phlegm on the ground! For example, Mr. B's nasal passage is stimulated a bit, causing him to sneeze, and his snot flows out, so he pinches his nose and presses it to the ground, making you look askance, but he doesn't care! This is the ugliness of our Chinese people performing under "No Taboos."</p>
<p>Alas! In short, there are many examples of "No Taboos!" You only need to pay attention and observe anytime, anywhere.</p>
<h3 id="e210">Beside the Grand Canal <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Tang Zenggeng</p>
<p>Early morning, the sun of early spring, the wind of early spring. People emerge from the harsh cold of the winter god, straightening their bodies. Fish turn their white bellies in the water. The bustling banks of the Grand Canal are shrouded in the loving tenderness of the spring god.</p>
<p>Here, beside the Grand Canal, is an ordinary event:</p>
<p>A child of eleven or twelve years old selling fried dough sticks, wearing a set of worn-out clothes, carrying a basket in his right hand, he opens his throat and shouts for his life, hoping that in such shouts, he can do more business and earn a few more coins.</p>
<p>The child stands on the bow of the boat, craning his neck to look at the steamer coming in front. When the steamer gets closer, the child desperately jumps onto the trailer behind the steamer. Who knows that the boat is moving, and his footing is unstable. This poor child, along with the basket, the fried dough sticks, and the copper coins in the basket, falls completely into the river. The people on the boat, apart from an "ah ya" sound, do not offer any rescue. Fortunately, the child can swim, struggling for his life in the water. The fried dough sticks float away with the water, and the copper coins sink to the bottom of the river. Although he is struggling in the water, he still tries to grab those fried dough sticks. After some time, a soaking wet child finally climbs ashore, staring foolishly at the few fried dough sticks that floated away and he couldn't catch.</p>
<p>The child is covered in water, and his face is full of sorrow. He stands there silently, his eyes always fixed on the fried dough sticks in the river, already wet and soft in his hands. He falls into endless grief. He has to worry about his master's beating and scolding, and he also worries about where the money for the fried dough sticks will come from. A very lively child now stands there blankly, thinking, without moving or making a sound, two lines of tears hanging from his eyes.</p>
<p>While the child is still standing blankly on the riverbank, small boats are desperately searching for copper coins in the river. They are happy because they have an unexpected harvest. Who cares about the child's pain? Fortunately, there are a few kind gentlemen who give the child some money and send him on his way home.</p>
<p>This ordinary event lingers in my mind. I feel that the world is full of misery, and there are countless suffering children!</p>

<p>— Zui Chi Sheng</p>
<p>My friend, Mr. Jin, is from Taicang and works as a teacher in this city. The other day, I met with him in a restaurant, and he told me a story about a rich man in Taicang: It was quite interesting. So I wrote it down to amuse the readers.</p>
<p>This rich man's surname is Chen, and he has assets of hundreds of thousands. But he is by nature stingy, and he is also very frugal with himself. He never takes a sedan or a car when he goes out. Even for dozens of miles, or more than a hundred miles, he always runs. When he is a little hungry and thirsty from running, he does not go to a restaurant to eat, nor does he go to a teahouse to drink tea. However, if he passes by a small teahouse on the way, he will sit down. People think he will finally order tea, but he doesn't. He takes out two large sesame cakes from his side and asks the waiter for a glass of boiled water. He eats and drinks, eats the cakes, and then continues on his way. His other frugality can also be inferred. One day, he went to the countryside to collect rent. When his family members saw that he was not at home, they made "Shepherd's Purse and Meat Wonton" and prepared to feast. Unexpectedly, as soon as the wonton were made, someone came to report that the old man was back, and they could see him walking from afar. This made the family members anxious and helpless. But the mistress (his old wife) had a good idea, saying: "It doesn't matter, I have a trick to deal with him. And punish him to do hard labor, so we can still eat wonton in peace." She said: "Order the old nanny to take a liter of rice and scatter it on the square in front of the door." The larger the scattered area, the better. The old nanny did as she was told. When the old man arrived at the door, he saw so much rice on the ground, with several sparrows pecking at it. He felt a pang of heartache and muttered: "Alas! Who wasted this rice? It's really outrageous!" Saying this, he bent down and picked up the rice grains one by one, putting them in his pocket. By the time he had picked up every last bit of rice, the wonton inside were cooked and ready to eat. Poor him, patting his back, he was still unaware.</p>

<h3 id="e212">Kites of Pinghu <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>— Xingzhi</p>
<p>Once spring arrives, children everywhere are happy. On the green grasslands, they carry kites shaped like centipedes, butterflies, old men, and even new-fashioned airplanes, going out in groups to fly them high. What a delightful thing it is. In my hometown, there is a saying, "Crack melon seeds in the first month, fly kites in the second month," which shows the joy of this season.</p>
<p>Flying kites is an entertainment activity for children, but unexpectedly, farmers in Pinghu also have this elegant hobby!</p>
<p>I heard my colleague, Mr. Cai, say: "The kite that I can't forget the most is the kite of Pinghu."</p>
<p>"Every year in February and March in Pinghu, the peach blossoms are in full bloom, the rapeseed flowers cover the ground like gold, and the green grass is boundless. A group of farmers walk out of the thatched huts, each holding a large paper kite. Although these paper kites are not decorated very beautifully, they are larger in area than ordinary ones and are made much more sturdily than those bought in the market. Usually, the centipede style and butterfly style are the most common. After taking them out, they take advantage of the wind to fly them up. The kite strings are very long, mostly twisted by them in their spare time. The material is mostly hemp, so it is very tough and rough. Ordinary people use only one ball of kite string, but they often use a basket."</p>
<p>"Imagine! A kite string requires a basket, isn't that a considerable amount?"</p>
<p>"When they go out to work, they often fly the kites, letting them soar high in the sky, one by one, carefree and at ease. And the kite strings are tied to the trees. On the bright, colorful plain, a few artificial birds are dotted; before going out to work, they hang up a flag to comfort their minds. Imagine what a meaningful entertainment this is! They only take back the kites they flew at dusk when they go home."</p>
<p>"These kites also have a special kind of interest. Each kite has a bow. This bow is made of thin bamboo, with a hole through the middle section, and then bent, fitted with a thin copper or white rattan string, hung high on the kite tail string, vibrating in the wind, making subtle sounds. Lang lang lang..., ling ling ling..., kong kong..., fast and slow, high and low, coming out with the wind, like celestial music, the elegant sound of the human world, really able to absorb people's souls!"</p>
<p>"Several years ago, I walked through Pinghu and often saw such fun farmers' kites. The kite that I can't forget the most is the kite of Pinghu."</p>
<p>He said such a long passage about Pinghu's kites, which made me unable to help but yearn for it. I never thought that hardworking farmers would have such an elegant hobby! However, in these days of rural destruction, I don't know if the farmers in Pinghu still have the elegant hobby of flying paper kites as before?</p>

<p>— Originally by Princess Deling of Qing, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Then, many eunuchs went outside the garden to carry back several loads of fresh mulberry leaves. But even after carrying them back, they could not be used immediately; they had to be carefully washed one by one with lukewarm water that was not too hot, making sure that there was no dirt left on the leaves. Each large bamboo tray of silkworms must be carefully tended by two girls: When one is washing the mulberry leaves, the other uses a clean towel to dry the washed mulberry leaves, laying them flat on the bamboo tray. As soon as the silkworms see the mulberry leaves, maybe they don't see them, but touch them with their feelers, they immediately open their mouths and chew vigorously; if you put your head down a little, you can see their mouths moving non-stop very clearly, and you can see them eating from a very small hole, to the point that they can crawl through it with their own bodies, and the time it takes is very short. Therefore, mulberry leaves must be added twice a day: once in the morning and once in the evening: and later, they must be added three times.</p>
<p>On the afternoon of the first day of feeding large mulberry leaves, when I went to watch again, I only saw that most of the mulberry leaves in each tray had only some leaf veins left, and a few greedy worms were chewing on the veins; I felt that when the worms were eating mulberry leaves, the shape was really ugly, and we could also hear their chewing sounds. And in these large houses dedicated to raising insects, there are probably thousands of silkworms or more, so when we walk in, we can hear bursts of rustling sounds, as if raindrops are hitting dry grass.

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Yang Wanhua said: "Sir, you should know the saying that hunger and cold breed thieving thoughts? To be honest, when I first came to Xi'an, I lived in a hotel and spent a lot of money. I didn't expect that in a year, I would fall into such a state." Jia Duocai said, "You have been in Xi'an for a year. Why did you come to Xi'an?" Yang Wanhua had raised her head, but when he asked this, she lowered her head again. Although she had even done petty theft, she still blushed and felt ashamed. After a pause, she continued: "Mr. Jia, do you think I look like a young lady in this state? I've been married for a long time." Jia Duocai said, "Is your husband not in Xi'an?" Yang Wanhua said: "My husband is a businessman. He opened a shop in Nanjing and could have made a living. It was my fault. I wanted to be a mistress for no reason, so I betrayed my husband and followed a man named Yun to Xi'an. According to that man named Yun, as soon as he arrived in Xi'an, he would get an official position. But after being in Xi'an for three months, he almost didn't even see the face of an official. He didn't bring much money either. After arriving in Xi'an, the money was spent in less than a month. Telegrams and express letters were sent one after another, asking friends in Nanjing and Shanghai to remit money to help him. Although a few friends did remit money, the amount was very small. After spending more than a month in Xi'an, there was really no way out, so he told me that he was going to Luoyang to find a friend, and told me to wait in Xi'an, and he would definitely be back in a week. Originally, I knew that he couldn't even scrape together enough money for his own travel expenses, so how could he take me? Rather than the two of us being trapped in Xi'an and starving to death, it would be better to let one person go out and try to find a way. So when he said he wanted to leave, I didn't try to stop him at all and just let him go like that. Who knew that after he left, there was no news at all, and he just left me in Xi'an." (16)</p>

<p>Yesterday, the gold market saw another decline in the New York cotton market, tightening the local foreign exchange market (because the local market has about a thousand overbought contracts, which are bound to be subject to margin calls), leading to a secondary decline that failed. Instead, it became firm, with Western merchants rushing to settle accounts, and Chinese merchants trying to buy but finding it difficult to obtain, with depleted shares. The market was even higher in the afternoon. In the early morning, overseas silver markets saw London rise and the U.S. remain stable, while Montevideo silver markets saw slight fluctuations. Exchange rates contracted. London spot silver rose one shilling and six pence. Over-the-counter forward trading opened, falling to around $60, and then retreating to $58 or $59. Major players took the opportunity to buy at low prices. The central bank's official exchange rate was announced, with the British pound stable and the U.S. dollar falling to .75. Customs gold unit rose 1.9 fen. The standard price for margins rose to $91.8, and then immediately rose to over $60. Generally, the market psychology was that the U.S. cotton market's sharp fall led to expectations of a tight local foreign exchange market, and confidence had begun to stabilize. Therefore, after the opening, a wave of bank buying suddenly arose, and the market immediately rose. Banks unloaded shillings, briefly retreating into the $60 range. Banks frantically tried to buy. Since then, the foreign exchange market has tightened, with a tense atmosphere. However, after foreseeing that HSBC's official exchange rate would see the British pound rise 1.25 and the U.S. dollar fall 0.0625, there was still much hovering after the high point. However, HSBC and the British American Tobacco Company rushed to settle, and Sassoon also had buying intentions. The market situation remained stable. At noon, as buying pressure increased, floating longs tried to push up the market, causing a sudden surge. The foreign exchange market also tightened accordingly, approaching the $70 mark after the noon session. After the market opened in the afternoon, it immediately broke through $70. After the opening, Chinese merchants turned around and tried to settle, but banks lacked supply, and it rose again. However, as Sassoon and others took advantage of the high price to sell, the market gradually declined after the high point, but did not break the $70 mark. Major players still entered at low prices. India's silver market initially reported a rise in Anna, at which time the situation was peaceful and hovered only. India's silver market reported stability once. Since then, buying pressure remained strong and gradually saw improvement. Chinese merchants took the opportunity to buy, which was extremely difficult. The foreign exchange market was even more charming. Shares in the market were depleted, resulting in a more intense rise. Finally, major players took the opportunity to cut longs, and the market fell slightly after the high point. Although there are few shares at present, if hedgers work hard to add margin, there is a risk of violently shaking the floating short positions. The future may rise. Although the overseas silver market may not necessarily lead to it, what about the local market sentiment? Swaps, as the central bank still intends to buy futures at par, short sellers are worried, and the discount has fallen to within one dollar. Today, I will record the day's market situation:</p>

<p>Yesterday, due to certain reasons in the foreign exchange market, the foreign call money rate eased slightly. The morning and afternoon rates were both six percent.

<h3 id="e218">Securities: Market Rumors of New Bond Issuance Cause Bond Prices to Plummet at Closing <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the price fluctuations on the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange were quite volatile. With the settlement date approaching, even slight news was enough to sway people's minds. For example, the rumor that a real estate company intended to issue 500 million in circulating notes, although it was known that the financial community would not agree and that there were no such large sums of cash available, and that such circulating notes were not convertible bonds, the matter was of great importance and could only be discussed briefly. However, the market was shocked, enough to shake the hearts of some people. Moreover, the tight money supply, making it difficult for bulls to exit, was an undeniable fact. Yesterday, the opening in the morning saw the most selling of numbers 48 and 53, and the most buying of numbers 4 and 16. However, among retail investors, selling was more than buying, and the overall situation was still oversupply. The steepest drop was in the current month of the 22nd Customs Bond, which fell by half a yuan. This was because the government had allowed the exchange of 10,000-yuan notes for 1,000-yuan notes, meaning that the 10,000-yuan notes, which could not circulate in the market, were easily converted into circulating 1,000-yuan notes. The amount of chips suddenly increased, which also had an impact. In the secondary session, the selling pressure remained. The early declines narrowed by 0.2 or 0.3 yuan, but from the short position of the Gold Bond, the interest of number 29 and the Northern Gang suddenly intensified, reversing the rise and returning to around 0.1 or 0.2 yuan. The apprehensive hearts were slightly calmed by this. At the opening in the afternoon, those who had gone short from a long position in the morning covered their positions, causing a strong rebound. The Consolidated Tax Bond rose sharply by more than 0.5 yuan, even exceeding the previous day's price. However, the "yuan jin duan" (distant Gold Bond), was suppressed by the frenzied selling of number 53, and the market atmosphere turned weak. At the close, there was a sudden rumor of the issuance of 100 million in 24th Year Public Bonds. Number 43 was sold at 19 Customs Units, and number 54 was sold at 19 "shan" (good) units. People gradually became panicked, and the decline became more severe. The largest declines were 0.6 or 0.7 yuan. The market price eventually turned downward across the board, ranging from 0.1 or 0.3 yuan to 0.6 or 0.7 yuan. The volume of transactions was estimated to be around 20 million yuan. The following is a comparative table of the sudden rises and falls (unit: yuan):</p>

<p>A new foreign firm reports that yesterday (the 18th), the markets for American stocks, bonds, grains, and goods were all affected by the situation in Europe. Stocks fell by more than two yuan before stabilizing. American Telephone and Telegraph reached its lowest point in three years. In the bond market, Belgian public bonds plummeted by five yuan, and German public bonds fell sharply by one yuan. The exchange rate of the US dollar against the British pound group soared, while the exchange rate against the gold standard group declined. The Belgian franc rebounded due to reports that France was prepared to protect the exchange rate of the gold standard group to resist attacks by speculators. The Belgian government stated that the position of the Belgian franc's gold standard was not weak. However, Wall Street speculators believed that Belgium had abandoned the free gold standard because it had restricted the export of gold and foreign exchange. The pound sterling's sharp drop of five points caused confusion in the commodity market. Most of the selling came from abroad. Sugar was the only exception, rising due to the unrest in Cuba. Total trading volume for the day was 590,000 shares.</p>

<p>The yarn market is trending downward, and the decline is intensifying. Due to the weakness of the global cotton industry and the sharp fall in US cotton, people's confidence has been greatly shaken, and the bull camp has been shaken. However, one major bull remains calm and has not yet taken action. In the afternoon, the big bear "Mao Ji" covered their short positions for profit, and the market stabilized slightly.</p>
<p>Yarn Prices Fall Across the Board to the 80 Yuan Level</p>
<p>At the opening of the raw yarn market in the morning, the situation was extremely fearful, with all months falling in unison. Due to the decline in overseas cotton, the market situation was very dangerous. The bulls showed signs of unease, but one major bull remained calm and did not release their positions. However, the general floating bulls, given the turbulent global trend, painfully cut their losses. The market was extremely panic-stricken until the third session, with all months breaking through the 80 yuan level. As a result, all months fell by 1.9 yuan to 3.3 yuan. At the opening in the afternoon, "Mao Ji" covered a large number of short positions, with 12,000 bales, and the market price rose by 0.4 to 0.5 yuan. However, it fell back again by the closing session. As a result, the near months rose by 0.4 to 0.7 yuan, while the far months were flat. The major sellers included Dafeng (1,500 bales), Mingde (1,500 bales), Renfeng (1,000 bales), Yuan Yi (1,800 bales), Yichang (1,550 bales), Changfeng (4,700 bales), Deji (1,300 bales), Yida (1,350 bales), Tongji (1,300 bales), Dachang (1,400 bales), and Chong'an (700 bales). The major buyers included Suilong (1,150 bales), Mianchang (2,900 bales), Taixing (1,300 bales), Shenchang (1,100 bales), Junchang (2,350 bales), Taichang (1,900 bales), Renfeng (11,000 bales), and Shengyuan (750 bales). The daily high, low, and closing prices are as follows:</p>
<p>Raw Yarn High Price Low Price Closing Price Change from Previous Day Account Balance</p>
<p>March 180.2 178.7 177.9 Down 2.30 16,850</p>
<p>April 179.6 178.4 177.9 Down 1.60 48,450</p>
<p>May 179.2 177.8 178.5 Down 2.20 47,650</p>
<p>June 179.5 178.1 178.1 Down 3.10 36,000</p>
<p>July 180.2 178.5 178.6 Down 3.20 35,300</p>
<p>August 180.6 179.0 179.0 Down 3.30 27,140</p>
<p>Total 22,400</p>
<p>Actual Sales Slightly Decline Again</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales have become clearer. A total of 1,260 bales were purchased by various gangs throughout the day, with prices falling by 0.5 yuan. The purchase amounts for each gang are as follows:</p>
<p>Luzhou 10, Guangdong 125, Changsha 100, Nanjing 10</p>
<p>Inland 80, Yunnan 540, Tianjin 25, Sichuan 50</p>
<p>Jiangxi 35, Nanyang 5, Henan 95, Wuhu 5</p>
<p>The Cotton Market Declines Even More Sharply. With the sharp fall in US cotton, approaching the 1 jiao level, market conditions suggest that there is a risk of breaking through the 1 jiao level. As a result, foreign firms have been stepping up their selling in recent days, and the market has become increasingly loose. However, some bulls have not yet completely released their positions. Judging from the overall situation, it is not good. Moreover, foreign cotton prices are very cheap, and the position of Chinese cotton has been eroded. The calculated price of US cotton is only about 29.84 yuan.</p>
<p>Zheng Biao (Zheng Standard) Plunges 8 Jiao</p>
<p>At the opening of the raw cotton market in the morning, all months fell sharply in unison, and the situation was extremely fearful. US cotton continued to decline and was approaching the 1 jiao level. Indian cotton fell by 8 rupees in the unofficial market. The global cotton market fell sharply across the board, and people were panicked. There were many floating bulls who painfully cut their losses, and the market became increasingly difficult to support. All months broke through the 34 yuan level. As a result, all months fell by 0.6 to 0.8 yuan. In the afternoon, Daji covered their short positions for profit and stabilized somewhat. However, the market weakened again in the second and third sessions because Shenxin Factory purchased foreign cotton at a price that was about 2 yuan lower per dan than the previous day.

<p>—Over 50 Pounds Sterling—</p>
<p>Yesterday, US cotton fell sharply again due to large-scale selling by foreign firms, unfavorable news from Liverpool, and instability in foreign politics and currency systems. This caused many long positions to be painfully liquidated, and factories increased short selling to preserve cotton and textiles. Demand from within the industry was strong, with buying in the middle of the day, but the public lacked confidence in the government's cotton policy, and there was no improvement. Later, some short positions were covered, and the market stabilized slightly, but it eventually weakened again due to public selling. Spot demand was weak, and deliveries were not high. The textile industry was unstable, but there was hope for changes in handling fees. The closing was extremely weak. Spot prices fell by 55 pounds sterling, and futures prices fell by 43 to 58 pounds sterling. British spot cotton fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 29 to 31 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to selling by European exporters, but then rebounded due to speculative buying. As a result, Pingguo fell by 2.5 rupees, Aomula fell by 6 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell by 1.5 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram from the 18th):</p>

<p>After the opening of the flour market in the morning, the prices of all months showed a sign of declining. The quoted price for foreign wheat, Chicago, fell by about 0.4 yuan, and Canada fell by 0.08 to 0.1 yuan. When the opening price was offered, the sentiment was inevitably weak due to the continued small declines in foreign wheat. The prices of all months showed weakness. Because inland factories made slight offers, the market atmosphere in the futures market became depressed. Until the opening in the afternoon, the current month remained weak in the market due to spot flour prices. As for the far months, the factories in this port were very quiet. Although the Yangtze River factory had small amount of sales, the market price showed weakness. As a result, the current month fell by 0.075 yuan, April fell by 0.01 yuan, May fell by 0.015 yuan, June fell by 0.015 yuan, July fell by 0.0115 yuan, and August fell by 0.015 yuan.</p>
<p>After the opening of the wheat market in the morning, the market remained in a wait-and-see state. Only July was offered, and the rest were empty. Until the opening in the afternoon, transactions in all months became relatively lively. However, there was a feeling of mutual rejection, so the market seemed flat and tired, and the opening price only fell by 0.01 or 0.02 yuan. Observing the future, there must be new wheat to be viable. As a result, the current month fell by a small 0.01, April fell by a small 0.01, July fell by a small 0.01, and August remained unchanged. The current wheat market has stabilized, and the asking prices for all months are slightly better by 0.02 yuan. Shandong Suxu wheat was opened at 3.63 yuan, and Bengbu Linhuai wheat. Xinda went to handle it.</p>

<p>Saigon Fluctuates</p>
<p>(South) Yesterday, a total of 24 shipments arrived from various gangs, with a total of more than 4,000 shi of goods. Among them, late rice was abundant. The sluggish market conditions were due to psychological factors, the market became even more stagnant. The various brands of late rice had more arrivals, including 400-500 bales from the Yantai gang. The situation was particularly weak, and prices fell by 0.1 to 0.2 yuan. Fortunately, the sources of various Japonica rice seemed inferior, and the prices continued to depreciate by several cents, up to 0.1 yuan. The various colors such as Du Jian and Yin Yuan showed signs of softening.</p>
<p>(Shanghai North) Yesterday, more than 20 shipments arrived from various routes in Hexia. There were fewer river accumulation boat owners, the situation was getting shorter and shorter due to sluggish sales. The market price of Bai Jing was nearly 0.1 yuan lower, and the price of early and late rice was slightly shorter by 0.06 to 0.07 yuan. Du Jian was soft, except for stabilization, but the price of Bai Yuan goods was rare and expensive by several cents.</p>
<p>(Foreign Rice) Customer transformation was lively, and local sales were also strong. A total of 9,000 bags of Saigon rice, 850 bags of Siamese rice, and 1,300 bags of small rice were traded, and they were distributed by the local street and the inland. The Nanjing gang also purchased again, so the market atmosphere was slightly stable. However, Saigon No. 1 long-grain rice had more than two inventories, and the guilds were eager to sell. Yesterday, the market fell by 0.1 yuan, while round-grain rice was welcomed by the local street, and the inland also inquired because it was similar to Japonica rice. The buyers competed for it at a high price yesterday. Other rice types were in a slump, and passenger rice was scarce and rare. Yesterday, the local street bought 50 bags of Xiang Ji oil rice, it was said.</p>

<p>Cotton imports: In February, the city imported 11,070 pieces of US cotton, Indian cotton, Egyptian cotton, etc. 8,399 pieces were US cotton, and the rest were Indian and Egyptian cotton.</p>
<p>Because the new tea has not yet entered the market, there are not many transactions and the standards are gradually decreasing. According to overseas telegrams, the price increased by 0.5 pounds sterling, which is pounds sterling per ton. The industry is rampant and the market is depressed, so there are few orders.</p>
<p>White lead has also been cleared recently, and the goods are arriving enthusiastically, so the standard is gradually loosening. It is only sold for 16 yuan per dan, which is a drop of about 0.5 yuan compared with the 10th.</p>

<h3 id="e228">A Chinese of the Oblomov Type <a href="#e228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— Xihe</p>
<p>There are many among us who waste their years in hesitation, doubt, and laziness, ultimately accomplishing nothing. We want to describe this morbid state, but cannot find suitable words; we want to correct this shortcoming, but cannot find the root cause; there is undoubtedly something missing from this life, but we do not know exactly what is lacking. Perhaps our gaze turns to literary works: Pushkin's Onegin? No. Shakespeare's Hamlet? No. Turgenev's Rudin? Somewhat similar, but not quite. It is merely a kind of inactive weariness, a chronic ailment of those with good talent, good education, and a good environment, yet fail to rouse themselves. Although we do not understand it, this chronic ailment is deeply entrenched in the foundations of our lives.</p>
<p>This question is answered for us by the Russian Goncharov in his famous "Oblomov." This book describes a nobleman of the 1850s, who owns hundreds of serfs, but is by nature lazy and does not manage his estate at all. His servants, close friends, and doctors all try their best to free him from his lazy state, but to no avail. Later, he falls in love with a woman, but is too lazy to go through with the marriage because he fears the trouble involved. As a result, the woman leaves him, and he lives with another girlfriend, eventually dying of a chronic stroke. Throughout his entire life, he never encountered any problems with hunger or cold, and never even put on his own socks. It's not that he had no ideals, but he retreated whenever he encountered harsh reality. When it came to work, all his excitement cooled down. He believed that the world did not need to be reformed, and was satisfied with preserving his estate filled with the air of sleep. "At times, in the depths of his heart, he cried intensely for the sorrows of mankind. He felt an indescribable suffering and sorrow, and yearned to go far away." But in the end, he would not even do something as small as moving, and finally retreated back to his comfortable fortress. When his lover parted from him, she said to him: "...You are as gentle as a dove, you put your head under your wings and ask for nothing more. You are prepared to coo under a roof for the rest of your life." Yes, he was such a person, his whole life filled with an attitude of indifference, a lack of love for struggle and progress, unresisting and yielding to being subjugated, idly wasting his golden years, and falling into the grave without accomplishing anything.</p>
<p>The reason for this is that he was only a "head person," a "mouth person," and not a "hand person."</p>
<p>What a profound lesson this work should be for us! Being too lazy to do anything, only thinking, thinking, and confining oneself with conservatism, is not only a chronic ailment prevalent in Russian life. As an Oblomov who does not rouse himself to self-help, he can find many friends in our ancient China. Those who ignore reality, focus on the void, and leisurely let the years pass, have long exhausted the spring of life and lost their foothold. For these human superfluities, we feel that there is nothing to say but sigh.</p>
<p>Human history increases in beauty and grandeur because of the constant striving for advancement. It is like the mythical Arabian bird Phoenix, spreading its two pairs of wings and rushing into the flames, in order to shed its old self and emerge with a new life. Such a life of striving and effort is the main reason why humans become the "spirit of all things," isn't it? But Oblomov was not fortunate enough to share in the glory and joy of creation. I think there must be many Oblomov-type people among us, or at least, there is some Oblomov blood flowing in our veins. But such a work and character, in terms of teaching and enlightenment, is undoubtedly one of our best mirrors.</p>

<p>— Hanfeng</p>
<p>On Novels</p>
<p>Almost every book discussing novels mentions three great works: "Dream of the Red Chamber," "Water Margin," and "The Scholars." Although opinions differ, none are as marvelous as those of Cao Muguan, the principal of Shanghai Chengzhong Middle School. Readers of "Yu Si" (Gossip) will likely remember this Mr. Cao. In 1924, he wrote a letter to the editor of a magazine, commenting on these three books with the annotations: "A novel of sexual desire: 'Dream of the Red Chamber'; A novel of thieves: 'Water Margin'; A scientific novel: 'The Scholars'." In recent years, it is feared that he is the only one who analyzes novels in this way. I remember that Shen Congwen also had a wonderful comment on novels, which seemed to be published in "Yu Si," "On Zhang Ziping." His main idea was that Yu Dafu's novels describe sexual frustration, while Zhang Ziping's novels are a release of sex. For reading these two authors' novels, it is best to read Yu first, then Zhang, so that one can experience the wonders of "frustration" followed by "release." This criticism is extremely humorous, but I wonder if Mr. Shen's purpose in writing this article was only to "be humorous."</p>
<p>"Whither Shall We Go?"</p>
<p>In 1925, Mr. Ye Shengtao, lamenting the suffering of the times, wrote a reflection called "Whither Shall We Go Amidst the Many Calamities?" He felt that the era was far from "comfort," and that there was no such thing as "paradise."</p>
<p>"It is so south of the river, and it is so north of the river; it is so east of the mountains, and it is so west of the mountains. Whither shall we go?" He raised this question. He used Yu the Great climbing to the top of a tower to look at the flood as a metaphor. He said, "Although Yu only saw a vast flood in all directions, he never sighed, 'Whither shall we go amidst the many calamities?' He did not sigh, he did not think about the 'whither' question. He felt that this land of many calamities could be transformed into a paradise with few calamities, so he decided on the ambition to control the waters and opened the first page of our nearly four thousand years of history." He was very surprised, "Why do people today only sigh, 'Whither shall we go amidst the many calamities'?" He said: "'Whither shall we go' means 'nowhere to go'." Therefore, in the conclusion, he hoped that every Chinese person would become a "Yu." Mr. Shengtao's meaning is worthy of respect. In a time of "many calamities," there is indeed "nowhere to go." If one cannot become a "Yu," there are in fact only two paths placed before one: "One, to be swept away by the waves and swallowed by big fish; two, to transform into a fish in order to survive in the flood." "Whither shall we go amidst the many calamities?" After Mr. Shengtao raised this question, I feel that it is still necessary to raise it again.</p>

<p>— By Tokunaga Nao, Translated by Ye Yin</p>
<p>Those big Russian devils, all obediently and submissively, grinning, were chased away by the short Japanese soldiers' sharp, quarrelsome-like orders, leisurely and with wide strides heading to the upper rooms, etc.</p>
<p>I once ate the leftovers of those Russian devils. It was millet rice with a lot of vegetable oil.</p>
<p>"Probably Russian devils eat greasy things."</p>
<p>Mother tidied up the basket, her mouth full of chunks of millet rice. As soon as I heard that it was something that the Russian devils ate, I immediately stopped eating it. Moreover, I thought to myself: Can it be that we can't even eat the leftovers of the Russian devils? Although I didn't say it to my mother, I already felt the sorrow and shame of the poor. From that day on, I never went to see the Russian devils again.</p>
<p>(Two)</p>
<p>I felt ashamed that my parents were poor. Unlike a seven- or eight-year-old child, I was very considerate and sensible about things.</p>
<p>Moreover, my relatives were among the poorest in the village. The children of the villagers' peasants would scold me as soon as they saw my face:</p>
<p>"Leftover eater, leftover eater."</p>
<p>I was even beaten up by the youngest son of the landlord, who was much weaker than me, named Shirōji.</p>
<p>Even though I was beaten up, I didn't cry. Even if I cried, I wouldn't dare to cry at home in front of my mother. Because if I cried in front of my mother, I would definitely be beaten again by her.</p>
<p>Once, I cried and went home, so my mother took my hand and brought me to the house of A-Yuan, the king of fights who beat me, and said to A-Yuan's mother, her face flushed with anger:</p>
<p>"No matter how worthless the son of a poor person is, you shouldn't just ignore him when you see him beaten up so bloodily!"</p>
<h3 id="e232">The Crippled <a href="#e232" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c232" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">232</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Tianyu</p>
<p>The two brothers had the same illness: half of their limbs were paralyzed, they needed help to walk, and they always shook their heads and twisted their mouths when they spoke, as if they couldn't speak without doing so. Some people called them "a natural pair of treasures."</p>
<p>However, the two brothers also had differences. The elder brother developed the illness after he got married, while the younger brother was born with it. Everyone said: Perhaps the feng shui of their house was bad, which caused both brothers to become disabled.</p>
<p>The woman, in order to cure her husband's illness, decided to dig up the ancestors from the old tomb and bury them in a new tomb. She hoped for a whole year, but finally despaired, because her husband's illness was still the same, neither better nor worse.</p>
<p>This woman was extremely beautiful. She had black eyes and peach-colored cheeks, and a figure that could be described as "healthy and beautiful." But her husband was a cripple, the most useless thing in the world. How could she not be annoyed, sad, and often in tears?</p>
<p>Many people often shook their heads and sighed when they saw her helping her husband walk, saying: "It's really a sin! A fresh flower stuck in cow dung!"</p>
<p>These words pierced her heart, and she couldn't help but feel sad. Poor thing! She had to work even when she was sobbing! The family was poor, what could she do? The two brothers were both disabled and couldn't move. If she didn't find some work to do, wouldn't the three lives in the family starve to death?</p>
<p>A year, two years, passed. The woman's face became thinner with the passage of time.</p>
<p>In the spring of the third year, the elder brother saw that his wife's face gradually became radiant, the clouds of sorrow also dissipated, replaced by a trace of unhidden smile. What was especially strange was that a well-dressed man often came to find her, and she often went out with him.</p>
<p>The elder brother knew that something was not right, but there was nothing he could do. He was a cripple and couldn't control his wife. The younger brother was also a cripple and couldn't help him take revenge.</p>
<p>He passively endured it, pretending not to understand anything. When he saw the man and woman walk out together, he only rolled his eyes and didn't say a word. His only hope was that his wife would not leave him and go.</p>
<p>However, this hope was soon shattered.</p>
<p>That day, when he got up in the morning, he didn't see his wife. He thought she would be back in a moment, but by the afternoon, she was still nowhere to be seen.</p>
<p>The two brothers' stomachs were growling with hunger. They called for people, but there was no response. They couldn't move themselves, and there was no rice in the house. The two of them could only shed tears together.</p>
<p>She didn't come back that day, nor the next day, nor the third day. When would she come back?</p>
<p>A few days later, people passing by outside the house suddenly smelled a foul odor. They walked into the house and took a look. Oh! The two brothers were hanging facing each other, their eyes bulging, their tongues sticking out, their noses and mouths full of purple blood, and their bodies emitting a foul smell...</p>
<p>The bystanders all pinched their noses, frowned, and said:</p>
<p>"Living treasures have become dead treasures! These kinds of people suffer when they are alive, and death is a blessing!"</p>
<h3 id="e233">A Visit to the Oriental Culture Academy (Part 1) <a href="#e233" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c233" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">233</a></h3>
<p>— Lanru</p>
<p>A solemn and magnificent building like a palace, shrouded under towering gingko trees, this is the Oriental Culture Academy.</p>
<p>There were seven of us in total who went to visit. After each of us handed over our name card to the receptionist, we were soon led into a Western-style reception room. The most troublesome thing when meeting friends or visiting places in Japan is taking off your boots, but today was an exception. When the messenger gave each of us a pair of overshoes to wear over our leather shoes, everyone's faces showed happy smiles.</p>
<p>These overshoes were made of a piece of yellow canvas, shaped like a small boat, with both ends the same size. The opening of the shoe was sewn with elastic bands, and each pair was the same size. This was difficult for me! If I were allowed to exaggerate a little, both of my feet could fit into one overshoe, but unfortunately my feet were uncooperative, they were not born together.</p>
<p>Although it was only about twenty steps from the entrance to the reception room, the overshoes fell off twice. On one hand, I felt embarrassed, and on the other hand, I felt a little annoyed, as if I had a premonition that today's visit would not be a good one—because this thing was acting strangely.</p>
<p>A thin gentleman in a suit (I forget his name at this time) walked in, greeted us, and then arranged the seven name cards, recognizing us individually like a teacher calling roll. He said many polite words such as welcoming us to visit and asking for guidance.</p>
<p>Next, he reported that the Oriental Culture Academy has two research institutes, one is the one we are visiting, and the other is located in Kyoto with a similar scale. The total annual funding for the two places is 300,000 yuan. The purpose of establishing the Oriental Culture Academy is to study Chinese culture and to promote the popularization and improvement of general culture.</p>
<p>"The process of establishing the Oriental Culture Academy is also very simple," the gentleman said modestly. "Initially, on October 4, 1928, professors from Tokyo and Kyoto Imperial Universities, as well as more than thirty people who were enthusiastic about studying Oriental culture, held a meeting in Tokyo to request the government to establish the Oriental Culture Academy. Soon, they unexpectedly received permission from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the work of the Culture Academy began in April of the following year. Research institutes were established in Tokyo and Kyoto, attached to the libraries and exhibition halls of the two Imperial Universities, and the reproduction of ancient Chinese books began at the same time. Later, the locations of the two research institutes were determined, and construction began. The one in Kyoto was completed in 1930, and the one in Tokyo was completed in the summer of 1933, so we have only been working here for about a year."</p>
<p>He said all this in one breath, and we just listened quietly, sometimes nodding mechanically. He seemed to see that we could not listen to him for a long time due to time constraints, and wanted to visit immediately. So he went out first and brought many copies of the Oriental Culture Academy overview and opening ceremony commemorative postcards to distribute to each of us, so that we could know the general situation inside and avoid being confused when visiting.</p>
<p>This house is really too beautiful! The inside is even more solemn and magnificent than the outside! From the outside, it looks a bit like the Summer Palace in Beijing, China. The stone steps and floors, stone pillars, and walls inside are all built of granite and marble, so when we stepped on the smooth, beautiful, and clean marble, the overshoes were especially easy to slip out of the leather shoes. Two or three people were like me, taking a few steps and squatting down again to pull the two "small boats". Although I felt very troubled in my heart, I could only worry in vain.</p>
<p>Naturally, the main purpose of our visit was to count how many books they have and what kind of books they have, and what they are currently researching.</p>

<h3 id="e234">Confucius Revisits the New World <a href="#e234" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c234" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">234</a></h3>
<p>— Chunyu</p>
<p>Jinan telegram of the 13th: According to Japanese Consul Nishida, the new Confucius Temple built by the Yushima Confucian Society in Tokyo, Japan, is scheduled to hold its completion ceremony on April 28th, and will expand the Confucius memorial ceremony. At that time, prominent scholars and celebrities from inside and outside the region will be invited to participate. Since this province is Confucius' hometown (whether the so-called hometown refers to Shandong), special attention will be paid. It is planned to invite one descendant each from the Yan, Zeng, Si, and Meng families, as well as two famous Confucian scholars from the local area, to participate, and travel expenses will be given. If direct descendants do not go, they can send representatives.</p>
<p>When I read this news, I laughed. If Lu Province is Confucius' hometown, then Yushima is his adopted hometown. Although Confucius traveled around the countries and was busy on the road, going everywhere, he had never been to Japan. Now he is making a trip to the Eastern Sea, which is much more glorious than Mei Lanfang and Hu Die going to Moscow to perform and visit the movies. In the future, if anyone wants to invite him, the old man may be happy to go. Isn't this Confucius revisiting the New World?</p>
<p>But Confucius's doctrine is to respect the Zhou Dynasty, resist the barbarians, advocate benevolence and righteousness, and reject hegemonic tactics. Therefore, when he wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, he wrote what should be written and cut what should be cut, without any mercy. Therefore, Confucius wrote the Spring and Autumn Annals, and rebellious ministers and traitors were afraid. I wonder if Confucius is willing or not to go to Japan this time? Moreover, Confucius was born in Lu, grew up in Lu, and died in Lu. His family lived in Shandong for generations and never moved from their old home. Now Japan wants to invite him to move to Yushima to live, to change and change fresh air. I am afraid that Confucius is attached to his homeland and will not necessarily think about floating on the sea on a raft again, right?</p>
<p>Although Confucius is known as a sage, he was unusually stubborn by nature. Therefore, Confucius traveled in a carriage with two horses, and if he disagreed with someone, he would leave. Moreover, he was most afraid and opposed to fighting. In the past, knives, spears, and halberds already felt cruel, not to mention airplanes and cannons now. Duke Ling of Wei asked Confucius about military formations, and Confucius replied: "I have heard of sacrificial vessels, but I have not studied military affairs." He left the next day. On another occasion, Confucius was also in Wei, and it happened that Kong Wenzi of Wei was about to attack Taishu and asked Zhongni for advice. Zhongni said, "I don't understand." He turned around, took his luggage, and left, saying, "Birds choose trees, but how can trees choose birds?" Therefore, Confucius was extremely opposed to the imperialists' policy of aggression.</p>
<p>Moreover, Confucius also had a problem, that is, he was not persistent. Confucius traveled around the countries for decades, and the longest he stayed was only three or four years, and the shortest was only a few months, before he had to go. Even if Japan invites him to the Eastern Sea this time, Confucius will definitely not stay long. Not only are the principles incompatible, but he also has a very deep sense of homeland. As soon as he encountered matters of war, he would run back home. Therefore, when Confucius was in Chen, Chen was once attacked by bandits. Confucius said, "Let's go back, let's go back. The young men of my party are wild and uninhibited, yet they are accomplished in literature. They are progressive and do not forget their beginnings, but I do not know how to restrain them." He was unwilling to be an official in a foreign country, and was willing to return to his hometown and be an old gentleman of scholarship. It can be seen that his sense of homeland is deep.</p>
<p>Or it may be said that Confucius dared to live among the Nine Yi because the air in the State of Lu was not good, or that it was humble. He firmly said, "If a gentleman lives there, what humility is there?" Therefore, Zhu Xi commented, "Where a gentleman lives, it will be transformed, what humility is there?" It can be seen that Confucius has also never thought of traveling abroad to promote his governing principles with the teachings of benevolence and righteousness. Therefore, he said, "I have heard of those who transform the Chinese into barbarians, but I have not heard of those who transform into barbarians." He was determined to use the principle of persuasion to transform other ethnic groups. Confucius's original goal was like this, so Confucius has also never denied the possibility of moving.</p>
<p>But although Confucius traveled around the countries, he could go everywhere. If he could transform them well, he would stay for a few more days. If he could not transform them well, he would leave. Therefore, he was determined not to move his home, saving a lot of trouble. Therefore, Confucius sometimes looks like an honest man, sometimes like a fool, but sometimes he is also very slippery and opportunistic. Confucius lived in Chen for three years, and it happened that Jin and Chu were competing to be strong, and they attacked Chen. Confucius then left. When he passed through Pu, he happened to encounter Gongshushi rebelling with Pu. The people of Pu detained Confucius, saying to Confucius, "If you do not go to Wei, we will let you go." Confucius made an oath with them, and then let Confucius out from the east gate. Confucius then went to Wei. Zigong said, "Can an oath be broken?" Confucius said, "It was a coerced oath, the gods will not listen, damn him." Now that Japan is preparing for war, it can be seen that Confucius will not necessarily go to Japan.</p>
<p>Therefore, I know that if Japan wants to invite Confucius to travel, Confucius will politely decline, saying, "I am very grateful for your kindness, but the old man is old, I am not accustomed to the water and soil here, I dare not accept your order." Afterwards, he will definitely take the zither and play it, saying, "Heaven is about to destroy culture, and those who die later will not be able to participate in culture. If Heaven does not destroy culture, what can the people of Kuang do to me."</p>
<h3 id="e235">Filial Daughter Temple <a href="#e235" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c235" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">235</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Weixiong</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, the weather has been exceptionally good. Every day I explore secluded spots and search for scenic beauty, an extravagance that doesn't seem fitting for someone who is ill. Having been here for less than two months, when I look in the mirror, my cheeks appear much fuller, and my spirits are indescribably lifted: this is naturally thanks to my friend. Last week, I sent him a lengthy letter of several thousand words, and because I didn't reread it, his reply indicated that he hadn't initially hoped I, a young person, would become so world-weary. Actually, I dare not entertain such thoughts, but being so attached to this idyllic paradise, I can't help but be emotionally moved. After reading his letter, I couldn't be bothered to explain myself. My vacation is also coming to an end, and the whip of life is already raised high. Can survival really be resolved through "world-weariness"? Cherishing this remaining time, I continue to banish myself to secluded environments each day.</p>
<p>Within the surrounding villages, my footprints are everywhere. One day, I casually mentioned wanting to venture a little further afield. The old lady told me that ten li away, there is a temple called Filial Daughter Temple. Legend has it that it was founded by the daughter of a certain Song Dynasty prime minister who, after her father's death, shaved her head here. However, later it was inhabited by monks and called a temple. Even the abbot, who propagates this story, doesn't know its origin. Since then, every year in the first month, village girls and women who aspire to be filial daughters travel from afar to burn incense and kowtow four times. The lively scene far surpasses any temple fair.</p>
<p>I don't usually like to join in the crowds, but experiencing such a unique custom once couldn't hurt. It was already the end of the month, and the host hired a small boat for me, as the only way to reach the Filial Daughter Temple is by water. The seven-year-old child naturally became my companion again.</p>
<p>The small boat traveled along the same river where we were prevented from walking in the snow that day. After turning a bend, a new world unfolded before my eyes. I couldn't estimate the size of the cemetery of unknown families. Towering pines and cypresses lined a solemn path to the tombs. It's a pity that my little friend can't recount the journey, which is regrettable. However, today's purpose is to see the spectacle at the Filial Daughter Temple, so I shouldn't ask for too much.</p>
<p>After about two hours on the water, we reached the Filial Daughter Temple. Even when we could only glimpse the red walls from afar, we could already hear the sounds of gongs and cymbals. The banks were lined with neatly dressed farm women, an endless stream. Our small boat docked in front of the temple, and a group of children gathered around, but they retreated in disappointment when they saw three men jump out of the boat. In front of the temple was a large open space, filled with various food vendors. The filial daughters, not afraid of losing face, crowded around the snack stalls to fill their stomachs. It's no exaggeration to say that we spent a great deal of effort getting from the riverbank to the temple gate. Today, this place was like a martial arts arena. Only if you had great strength could you get ahead. Trying to politely say hello was a waste of time. No one would pay you any attention.</p>
<p>The Filial Daughter Temple appeared quite grand. Because I didn't dare compete with the filial daughters, I, like others, simply watched the spectacle. After admiring a statue of a figure that was neither clearly male nor female in the main hall, I retreated. According to the boatman, the temple has five courtyards. Behind the hall is a large vegetable garden, and the main hall is in the third courtyard, so one can only superficially estimate the grandeur of the Filial Daughter Temple.</p>
<p>In the second courtyard, a dozen well-fed monks were chanting scriptures loudly, putting on a pious display. None of them dared to steal a glance from the corner of their eyes at the numerous filial daughters before them. If it weren't for the boatman's explanation on the way back, I would have been deceived.</p>
<p>It turns out that the temple's expenses are entirely reliant on the incense offerings from the first month. Two eloquent reception monks specialize in soliciting donations from the more affluent filial daughters by presenting donation registers. So, regardless of their misdeeds during ordinary times, they put on a serious facade and perform Buddhist rituals today as a means of collecting money. As a result, I became somewhat skeptical of the legend of the filial daughter. Unexpectedly, in this tranquil environment, as I was about to depart, I was given such a disappointing impression.</p>
<h3 id="e236">A Family of Three <a href="#e236" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c236" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">236</a></h3>
<p>— Lini</p>
<p>Just as the sky outside the glass window began to brighten, Xiao Lin tumbled out of bed, humming a tuneless song like a little sparrow. She stretched out her small hand, stroking Lin's fluffy hair, then turned around and pried open my eyelids, shaking my body and buzzing around my ears like a fly.</p>
<p>"Daddy, I want to buy a 'doo-doo' car... a 'doo-doo' car!"</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xiao Lin saw the new "doo-doo" car that the landlord's son had bought, which greatly pleased her childish heart. She secretly ran downstairs and played with her little friend in the living room, so much so that she didn't even want to come up for dinner. It wasn't until Lin went down to pick her up that she reluctantly came upstairs, still refusing to eat properly, crying and demanding to buy a "doo-doo" car.</p>
<p>"Okay, don't make a fuss. After you finish eating, Daddy will go to the company tomorrow and buy you a 'doo-doo' car. Be good!"</p>
<p>The little child's mind seemed to be still thinking about her beloved toy. She slept restlessly at night, muttering in her dreams and clamoring for a "doo-doo" car.</p>
<p>"Don't make a fuss. It's still early. Wait a bit and Daddy will go out and buy it for you."</p>
<p>Then, the little child happily smiled innocently, then slipped out of bed, humming a tuneless song, and ran downstairs to find her little friend to play with. Lin saw the child's innocent and happy expression and gave me an understanding smile.</p>
<p>A child's liveliness, innocence, pure and unadulterated expressions, and laughter can indeed fill a small family with joy and liveliness. However, sometimes, because of the child's affairs, the parents' minds are filled with anxiety and worry.</p>
<p>Sometimes, if the child catches a cold, her body feels uncomfortable, her smiling face is tightly shut, and she lies listlessly on the bed, dazed and losing her original innocence. She doesn't want to eat or talk. At this time, Lin doesn't know whether to laugh or cry, hiding in the room all day long, frowning and holding the child tightly in her arms, sighing and rocking her. She doesn't even have the heart to do housework. At this time, the air in the room feels particularly dull and depressing. Even the relationship between husband and wife feels cold, like two strangers who happen to meet and are indifferent to each other.</p>
<p>"Ren, I think we should buy Xiao Lin a 'doo-doo' car," Lin said hesitantly, while her heart seemed to feel a kind of extreme happiness. "Otherwise, when she sees other people's 'doo-doo' cars, she will cry and make a fuss... Wouldn't it be worse if she makes herself sick?"</p>
<p>I know that Lin cherishes her child the most.</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<p>She will try her best to grant whatever the child wants. She would rather save as much as possible on household expenses than let the child feel the pain of disappointment, so as not to hurt her childish heart.</p>
<p>"How can we afford it? A 'doo-doo' car costs at least ten dollars! ... The child will naturally forget about it completely in a day or two."</p>
<p>I thought about how difficult it is to earn a dozen dollars and our current economic situation. Buying a "doo-doo" car for the child to play with seems a bit unsuitable for our status. However, Xiao Lin suddenly ran upstairs again, standing in front of the bed like a little sparrow, buzzing around me and wanting to buy a "doo-doo" car.</p>
<p>At this time, I deeply felt that this small family of three has become a bit too heavy to bear.</p>
<h3 id="e237">After Abandonment <a href="#e237" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c237" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">237</a></h3>
<p>— Jingyun</p>
<p>The spring breeze, carrying a warm breath, leaked through the continuous, overlapping mountains of Meiling, awakening the two car-cover-like locust trees in front of Uncle Siwei's black gate, adorning them with a suit of tender green clothes, and swaying proudly in the warm spring breeze. The people in the village, bathed in the warm spring breeze, presented an air of new life and vitality, busily carrying seedlings and heading to the fields to work.</p>
<p>At this time, the two black-lacquered doors of Uncle Siwei's house were wide open. Looking from outside the door, one could clearly see the verdant oleanders planted on both sides of the courtyard. Hanging in the main hall was a large red satin banner embroidered with the "Eight Immortals", and red candles were burning. It looked like a New Year celebration, but there was also a band of musicians playing and drumming incessantly. This made the onlookers guess that Uncle Siwei's family must have a happy occasion today.</p>
<p>"Get out of my face! Today is my lucky day. Don't try to get me to give out lucky money! ... I don't have that much spare money to support you, you good-for-nothing. I've already supported you for over ten years, and you can't even do any work. You can't even give me a son... Damn it, get out of my sight! ... If you don't leave, I'll..."</p>
<p>Uncle Siwei, who had a flat nose, was wearing a brand new water-green silk cotton robe, topped with a black satin waistcoat. Although he was a middle-aged man, this outfit made him look at least a few years younger. He angrily raised his voice and cursed, and at the same time, personally dragged a middle-aged woman with messy, disheveled hair out the door.</p>
<p>The middle-aged woman sobbed sorrowfully, her eyes swollen and red like two overripe walnuts, her face covered with a silvery, paper-like pallor, barely resembling a living person. She sat on the stone steps at the door, her head hanging low, like hanging in front of her chest, crying like a child, mumbling unintelligible words.</p>
<p>The neighbors, men and women, abandoned their work and, with curious eyes, came to watch the spectacle, their backs against each other, chests against backs, surrounding her heavily, a sense of injustice and pity flowing through everyone's hearts.</p>
<p>"What's wrong, Aunt Siwei? What happened at home?" Aunt Houfu, nicknamed Nosy-Mouth, squeezed out of the crowd, her lips long and pointed like a rat's mouth, squatting down and pulling at the corner of Aunt Siwei's clothes.</p>
<p>"It's... because... I'm getting... old, not... pretty. So, that... old bastard said I... can't bear sons, so... he's abandoning me to take... a younger, more... seductive girl!" Aunt Siwei said between sobs, her throat hoarse as if pressed down by a heavy stone.</p>
<p>"That's outrageous! Heartless, immortal thing, you can't even have children yourself and you dare to blame others. When you were young, you flattened your nose whoring. You're lucky to still be alive, and you still dare to hope for a son!" Someone interjected from the crowd, cursing.</p>
<p>"Why don't you go tell the village chief and ask him to reason with Uncle Siwei? What's the use of crying?"</p>
<p>Aunt Houfu, the nosy one, finally made this suggestion to her.</p>
<p>"What's the point of telling the village chief? The village chief is fundamentally the same kind of person. Didn't he do the same thing himself before? Women who can't bear children must be abandoned like broken shoes. It's almost become a custom in the village. What's the point of telling him?" Old Man Lin San said with a sigh, then left the crowd, leaning on his crutch.</p>
<p>Most people seemed to know that this tragedy had no ending and scattered like birds, leaving Aunt Siwei alone, sitting on the stone steps, sobbing and constantly pulling up her sleeves to wipe away the tears welling up in her eyes.</p>

<p>Improper Rituals in Alliances and Diplomatic Meetings (Continued)</p>
<p>Now examining the records of Zuo Zhuan, the courteous interactions, the gestures of yielding and greeting, can be enumerated, can be pointed out, appearing throughout the records, this principle is incomprehensible. Alas, I understand it now! All people who desire to deceive the world and sell treachery, always do good in the sight of others, and do evil in the sight of those who do not see. Why not look back at oneself and take a close analogy? If the liver is diseased, the eyes cannot see; if the kidney is diseased, the ears cannot hear; if the spleen is diseased, the mouth cannot eat; if the heart is diseased, the tongue cannot speak. Disease that is unseen by others, will inevitably manifest in what is seen by others. Therefore, the hidden and the revealed, the obscure and the clear, are fundamentally not two different principles. What is hidden is stored up to be revealed, what is obscured is accumulated to be made clear. Those dukes, marquises, high officials of the Spring and Autumn period, never devoted themselves to the study of the dark room and leaking roof. When the time came for alliances and diplomatic meetings, even if they wanted to force themselves to pretend, there was eventually a time when they could not hide it. They forgot even when smearing blood, and did not realize they forgot. Those who became lazy after receiving the fifth degree did not realize their laziness. Those who sighed while playing music did not realize their sighs. Those who followed while talking did not realize their tears. Wearing a square cap, with jangling pendants, solemn and dignified, they believed themselves to be acting in accordance with ritual, but they did not know that people were already criticizing them behind their backs.</p>

<h3 id="e243">Grace Moore Says, "I Once Made a Living by Singing for Supper" <a href="#e243" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c243" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">243</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ji</p>
<p>There is no need here to write a short biography of Grace Moore, the most popular American singer of our time, or to recount her life's story. Simply put, she was not born into a humble family, nor was she a noble lady from a prominent household. Yet, she transformed herself from an unknown woman who wasn't worth a penny into a world-renowned figure. "Not worth a penny" is not an exaggeration, because from a young age, she was determined to study opera, but her father resolutely opposed it. She then resolutely abandoned the comfortable life at home to pursue what her heart desired.</p>
<p>Her decision to leave her family was not a rash act. On the contrary, she loved her family very much and found it difficult to leave them. However, one night when she could no longer bear it, because she wanted to follow the call of her own heart and yet obey her strict father's orders, she went alone to the mountaintop. In that place where heaven and earth met, in that silent midnight hour, she pondered and sought to find which path to take. She lay on her back on a large rock at the highest peak of the mountain, with a sky full of stars above her and the conflict between personal freedom and family love raging in her heart. She lay there until the east gradually turned pale, and the stars disappeared one by one, before slowly returning home. She decided that she must follow her own aspirations, and as for family love, she would find a way to restore it after achieving success.</p>
<p>She borrowed three hundred dollars from relatives and friends and set off for New York. She had no friends in New York, nor any pre-arranged work. Yet she went forward without hesitation, never doubting her future, even though she often did not know where her next meal would come from.</p>
<p>She lived in Greenwich Village in the countryside, sharing a sparsely furnished house with three other young women. In the daytime, they would go out early to look for work. The three hundred dollars dwindled and disappeared surprisingly quickly, but because she had a passionate ambition, she was not worried or afraid. Sure enough, she soon found a small position in a small restaurant in Greenwich Village—a singing position.</p>
<p>That small restaurant was called "Black Cat," just like the Italian restaurant where she sang for supper in the play "One Night of Love." At that time, her salary was barely enough for her own expenses and the tuition for the singing and music lessons that she considered essential. But she was not worried at all, because she had already found peace of mind. The three women who lived with her were also like-minded and carefree. She said, "We live for today, and we'll worry about tomorrow when it comes, but we all have soaring ambitions, so we all strive every day, moving towards our respective destinations. With each step forward, we all celebrate together. Many times, we had to evade the landlord because we couldn't pay the rent. We all learned to make one dollar do the work of five. But we maintained a high level of thinking, making each day's life an endless adventure!"</p>
<p>It is very comforting to know that all four of the women who lived with Grace Moore have now achieved considerable status. Besides Grace, one was a typist who later married a royal, and now occupies a very high position in European society; one is a dancer who is now famous throughout the world; and one is a sculptor who has not only won great fame in the art world but has also been worshipped by many men, two of whom committed suicide because their marriage proposals were rejected. These four musketeers still often correspond or meet in person. Doesn't this prove that anyone who strives with determination can achieve a considerable position in society?</p>
<p>As for what happened later, the years of struggle, as we mentioned above, we do not intend to write a short biography of her, so there is no need to elaborate. What we want to say is that her ambition to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House, the largest opera house in New York, was not achieved overnight. She went through countless hardships in singing and dancing training and in the struggles of life, but she said, "The ambition I held was not an empty dream. I never lost faith in my own abilities. If I doubted my own abilities, if I had to take a winding path in the course of advancement, and thought that I could not reach my goal, then I would have failed long ago. A person who is worried and depressed because of twists and turns and difficulties is unlikely to succeed."</p>
<p>She also said, "I have seen many people struggling anxiously to fulfill their aspirations, and I feel very sorry for them. Anxious struggle cannot last long. A person's mental energy is limited. If it has been eroded by anxiety, then how can there be any energy left to struggle? Therefore, to struggle, one must have freedom of body and mind, and not be entangled by worries. A person who lowers his head on the battlefield is bound to fail!"</p>
<p>In fact, Grace Moore grew up in the mountains of Tennessee. Therefore, she also has the following words: "I want to live on the mountaintop. I am permanently living on the mountaintop, whether physically or mentally. We can create our own mountaintop. On the mountaintop, we can see our dreams unfolding before our eyes. The most important thing is that we must see how many fragments our dreams are made of, and how success is also made of many fragments. Each fragment is an important part. Each fragment is worth fighting for. If I had not sung for supper, I might not have been able to perform at the Metropolitan Opera House."</p>
<p>Film Reviews</p>
<h3 id="e244">Review of "The President Vanishes" <a href="#e244" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c244" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">244</a></h3>
<p>— Ji Han</p>
<p>The President Vanishes - Cathay</p>
<p>Because many recent American films have used World War II as their main theme, we can see that the American people are indeed in a state of anxiety. In "The President Vanishes," the playwright raises the question of whether the United States should participate in the war when it breaks out. Thus, in the play, he assumes that the war has already begun in Europe, and some arms dealers or gray shirts (representing Fascists), using the slogan of preserving America's dignity, advocate participation in the war in newspapers. However, on the other hand, mothers who lost their sons in the First World War cannot help but feel infinite grief. At the same time, the playwright concludes in the mouth of the president at the end: Although the war debts of the United States cannot be recovered (which is used as an excuse to participate in the war), these war debts can never compensate for the blood shed by millions of soldiers.</p>
<p>Obviously, the playwright is anti-war. He believes that the quarrels of a group of arms dealers or politicians for personal gain are nothing more than a group of ducks chattering incessantly. Because a hysterical young man pours leftover wine on the Statue of Liberty to express his hatred, and then points out the theme of non-war in the mouth of the assumed national leader, we cannot help but be awed by his humanitarian righteousness. However, what can he do to curb this strong atmosphere of war? He makes the president hide, rumors are spread that he was kidnapped by arms dealers or Fascist thugs, so that the people of the whole country shift their target and hate the pro-war Fascists, and finally designs to kill the leader of the right wing. Clearly, this is not a solution. As the playwright says, there are many treacherous capitalists in the United States who are creating this war that destroys human civilization. The imperialist American government will never fail to participate in the Second World War and be one of the main members. The humanitarian president who supports peace in the play is ultimately just a well-intentioned fantasy figure of the playwright. On the one hand, he touches the essence of imperialist war to a certain extent, and on the other hand, he entrusts the theme to fantasy, which is either cowardice to escape reality or a lack of in-depth understanding of reality. Precisely because imperialist war is hindering human progress and destroying civilization, then only by using a historically decisive war to eliminate imperialist war, only after the final war can we guarantee the permanent peace of mankind. However, it must be said that when the clouds of war are permeating the entire world, even humanitarian non-war has its minimum significance.</p>
<p>After watching this film, we feel that its script is disorganized, and its structure is not well-organized. However, in some individual scenes, William A. Wellman's direction is very delicate and thoughtful, and several actors who play arms dealers also perform very well. However, in terms of tone, it just raises the plot and then suddenly falls down, failing to create a big wave from several small waves, that is, there is no main center of gravity as the climax of the play. Thus, we only see the scattered individual existence of each scene, without a general convergence. Moreover, the progress of the play becomes even more obscure in the second half, although the first half is quite brilliant. However, the director has indeed worked hard, and the main fault should be borne by the screenwriter. The form is not enough for the content, this film can be an example.</p>
<h3 id="e245">Review of "Music in the Air" <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Lun</p>
<p>Music in the Air - Da Guangming Cinema</p>
<p>From the appearance of the colors, "Music in the Air" is indeed a "lively" film. There is the cast of Gloria Swanson and John Boles, there are the songs of Kern and O. Hammerstein, there are the scenes of clear singing and wonderful dancing, and there is the intention of Joe May, the director who is not "rigid." However, if you examine the content, then this so-called "liveliness" will inevitably disappoint you. Besides telling you a cliché love story of a quadrangle, it is a sermon on being optimistic and enjoying the life of "celestial music and wonderful dancing."</p>
<p>The screenwriter also knows that such empty content is not easy to please, so, like the producers of all such films, they stubbornly cast the female lead as a famous actress in order to support the film with singing. In addition, they add comical acting and humorous dialogue to regulate the throat when tired of singing.</p>
<p>The director, who follows this screenwriting method, is also troubled by the lack of room to show his talents. Their power can be seen in the concise and powerful editing used for the tranquility of the countryside and the troubles of the city. Thus, he opens up delicate techniques and pursues light and witty interests. Due to the proper use of small movements, considerable success has been achieved in this regard. It should be especially mentioned that the two scenes of writing Carl in the countryside, the former using birds as an insertion, not only write out the innocence of the child and the life of the teacher Carl, but also cleverly introduce and portray the personality and mood of Ward at that time. The latter uses the tranquility of the countryside to reflect the mood in which Carl is going to the city to find Xiling. These are all successful grasps of the mood.</p>
<p>John Boles's stability and sophistication and the warm emotions of human nature, and Swanson's willful performance, have all reached their respective realms.</p>

<h3 id="e249">Clive of India (5) <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Mao De</p>
<p>While Clive was putting on the clean clothes that Captain Clark had brought, he said slowly, "I crawled in the enemy's lines for three days and three nights, enduring hardships and hunger, just to see you?" Manning said impatiently, "Then what is it? Tell me quickly!" Clive said, "Give me all the men. I'll relieve the siege of De Linapur." Governor Pigot frowned and told him that there were only one hundred and twenty men under his command now. Clive said, "That's enough."</p>
<p>Cand asked, "De Linapur has five hundred men and still can't relieve themselves. How can you relieve them with one hundred and twenty men?" Clive put on his clean socks and boots unhurriedly and said slowly, "Isn't that easy? I just won't go there." Warburton shouted, "Then how can you relieve their siege?" Clive said, "I'll attack Arcot." Warburton said, "Attack Arcot? Attack the capital of southern India with one hundred and twenty men?" He thought this was simply the dream of a madman.</p>
<p>But Governor Pigot understood his meaning. Although this was a near-mad act, but things had come to this, madness might point out a way out. He suddenly thought that there should be a few more madmen at this time. At this time, Clive was still explaining with a sarcastic tone: "If the enemy's strength is greater than yours, your only way is to divide them, and then divide them again, and then break them one by one. But you don't understand this. You don't have to worry about it either. Leave it to me. Also, gentlemen, you have no other way to go. Sitting here is waiting to be slaughtered. Now there is only one sentence, do you want me to do this?"</p>
<p>Governor Pigot rose up and said, "I unconditionally agree." Clive acknowledged the location of true authority, bowed to Pigot, and then turned around and instructed Captain Clark, "Gather all the men together—the lame, the blind, the sick, the drunk, the sober, all of them!" Captain Clark happily said, "Yes, sir!" He saluted smartly, then turned around and strode out.</p>
<p>Manning asked again, "Then when will you lead this madman team to set off?" Clive said, "Right now." He stood up and was about to follow Clark out. Suddenly he stopped again and asked, "Forgot the most important thing! Is there any letter from home?" Warburton said, "There are letters, but unfortunately the ship was captured by the French, and we didn't receive them here." Clive walked out while saying hatefully, "A bunch of fools. They only know how to sit on their tails and doze off. Letting my letter be robbed by the French!"</p>
<p>He reviewed his "army," the general people that Captain Clark had hastily gathered. He thought to himself, what a beggar team. But he knew that if he wanted to use them, he must first arouse their spirit and encourage their courage. He deliberately said loudly, "Captain, where did all these strong men come from! Excellent! You can't ask for better!" With just a few words, he had already created a small miracle. These many listless people actually stretched their shoulders flat, raised their heads high, and straightened their waists. Everyone felt in their hearts that with such an officer, the impossible was also possible. Clive asked the drummer boy, "What orders can you blow?" He said, "Attention, raise gun, stop, retreat—and go forward." Clive said, "I only want the last one—go——forward!" That team of mixed people had already set off. (To be continued)</p>

<h3 id="e250">The Newest 1935 Eight-Cylinder Ford <a href="#e250" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c250" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">250</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The most obvious features of the new eight-cylinder Ford are its new body style and unique construction. In terms of mechanics, it adopts the "center of gravity" principle of riding, so the ride is more comfortable. As for its chassis, there are also many improvements that make management easier. There are now 1.3 million of these newest Ford cars on the road.</p>
<p>After three years of continuous effort and research, the Ford factory has achieved this newest eight-cylinder car. Its ease of driving, comfortable ride, and novel structure are unmatched. It is the crystallization of careful improvement.</p>
<p>In terms of appearance, it has a fresh image and beautiful curves, suitable for modern tastes. The interior and all the equipment have also been carefully managed, making the body style of the new Ford perfect.</p>
<p>The progress of its engine and chassis is no less important than the car style. Among them, the most important feature is its adoption of a new spring suspension system. Also, the weight of the car and passengers is properly distributed, so that the passenger position can be in the center of the car, which is called "center of gravity" riding. Passengers ride between the wheels. In order to achieve this goal, the front car spring is lengthened and positioned more than four inches in front of the front axle, and the engine is moved more than eight inches forward, so that its importance is entrusted to the front axle. Both the front and rear springs can be stretched more than before. Also, due to the improvement of the front end of the chassis, the chassis position is more spacious, so the load weight can be redistributed to concentrate in the middle of the four wheels. Therefore, the weight entrusted to the two axles can be approximately equal, and the comfort of the rear seat passengers is no different from sitting in the front seat.</p>
<p>As for the reform of its external structure, the repositioning of the front spring engine is the main focus. The body can therefore be moved to the front, and passengers can sit in the middle of the axle. The rear mirror panel can also be arranged in a streamlined style. Between the mutual bumpers, the car is about eight inches longer.</p>
<p>Other things such as the engine car, the front window glass, and the mudguards are also new and beautiful.</p>
<p>Also, its wheels are smaller and its tires are larger, so there is no suffering from bumps when driving on rugged roads.</p>
<p>Speaking of the interior of the new Ford, its position is more spacious. Both the front and rear seats are widened. The front seat is widened by five and a half inches, which can accommodate three people without feeling crowded. The driver's seat has active devices on the sedan. The soft pads and all the equipment are suitable.</p>
<p>As for the engine, there are also many improvements. A DC crankcase ventilation device is installed, which can make the water vapor and gas emitted from the crankcase and valve chamber completely removed. Therefore, the residual water accumulated in the gasoline can be reduced to a minimum, and the formation of sludge and the dilution of gasoline are also reduced, which can extend the life of gasoline and reduce engine damage.</p>
<p>Also, the aircraft-style copper-lead connecting rod bearings are the same as those used on high-speed racing cars and aircraft engines. They are all designed to withstand hard work without any risk of being unreliable.</p>
<p>Also, its alloy cast camshaft is also new.</p>
<p>The brakes of the new Ford are of the latest style. They adopt an internal expansion style, which is intended to give a more effective braking function, and the foot force can be reduced. There is also a new type of sliding tip, which is part of its construction, which is to average the pressure. Its connector is new and simple. When starting and shifting gears, it requires less force and the action is quiet. At high speeds, the pressure is increased due to centrifugal force, which increases the original force and shifting ability of the connector.</p>

<p>As for the new and solid frame, the stable front and rear struts, the widened rear wheel track, and the strengthened rear axle are also its characteristics.</p>
<h3 id="e251">Austin Expands Overseas Market <a href="#e251" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c251" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">251</a></h3>
<p>— Yi</p>
<p>The British Industrial Exhibition is about to open. It is seen that customers from all over the world are still going to it from thousands of miles away. But in this voice, a large British manufacturer is selecting representatives in order to open up the market and promote sales. It is thought that this manufacturer is none other than the famous Austin Motor Company.</p>
<p>Since the factory's business policy has been decided, it specially dispatched an overseas representative by plane to Benma, Singapore, and the Masur Islands last week. Another representative went to China, Japan, and Canada. The third representative contacted all the important commercial centers in the Near East and Southern Europe before returning to Poland. In addition to this, personnel will soon be sent to Northern Europe and Sweden, Norway, and other countries. Because the trade situation in each of these places is good, the increase in Austin sales is very promising.</p>
<p>According to the factory's record, the overseas representatives all have the right to appoint distributors and allocate sales areas. Therefore, the importance of their mission is the same as that of a British commercial envoy. Last year's Austin export volume increased by 30% compared to the previous year. Now there is such a large-scale activity, so the total Austin export volume in 1935 will be more than that in 1934.</p>
<h3 id="e252">New Trends in 1935 American Car Body Manufacturing <a href="#e252" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c252" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">252</a></h3>
<p>— Ying Dai</p>
<p>(1) All-Steel Car Roof</p>
<p>In the past few years, the design of the upper part of cars has been greatly influenced by aircraft streamlining. The 1935 car bodies continue this trend. In fact, car manufacturers have been gradually improving their manufacturing processes and are satisfied with the current state, without seeking complete innovation. At first glance, the 1935 models may not seem much different from the previous year. However, upon closer comparison with the 1934 models, one will notice that the current year's manufacturing emphasizes smooth curves and reduces sharp lines. The most significant innovation in this year's car body manufacturing is the wider exterior and the use of all-steel for the roof. In the past, so-called all-steel car bodies usually had roofs made of fabric and steel wire. However, many of the 1935 models have pure steel roofs from front to back and left to right. One particular manufacturer, a well-known brand, still uses a combination of steel and wood for the car body. While other parts of the car body still contain wooden components, the roof is made entirely of steel.</p>
<p>(2) Front Appearance of the Car</p>
<p>Looking at the front of the car, one can immediately notice that the radiator is longer and narrower than before. This type of radiator was previously only used in high-end cars, but it is now commonly adopted. One car manufacturer has meticulously designed the radiator grille, frame, and shell to create a narrow radiator form. The long and narrow grille and frame are made entirely of chrome. The radiator shell is painted the same color as the car and is moderately wide. To ensure that the heat dissipation effect is not compromised, the curved side of the radiator shell has small, flat line perforations. Inside the radiator shell, narrow, flat line louvers are located at the top. In general, the front of the car is now designed very appropriately. Chrome is used economically for the radiator grille, frame, headlight bezels, and even the bumper guards. The fenders are wider and lower, with mud flaps that conceal the lower part of the chassis. On the running boards and the middle of the car body, the side mud flaps have been removed in some cases to make the car body look smoother and more beautiful.</p>
<p>(3) New Style Windshields</p>
<p>The backs of the front and rear bumper guards have undergone many reforms and designs, all having edges, and some even have defenses attached to cover the upper half of the rear wheels. Radiator shells and windshields were traditionally slanted. This year is the same. The radiator shell is rounder this year. The radiator cap has been moved back, just in front of the car body pillar. Windshields are fixed and adjustable, probably due to the influence of internal air circulation methods. There are many styles for air circulation inside the car, and there have been past successes. Double-piece windshields are installed diagonally in a V-shape to divert airflow. Some car manufacturers, to improve the ventilation on the roof, exhaust the heat from under the chassis by opening louvers under the fenders or engine side panels. At least one car manufacturer uses laminated glass for the windshield, with the middle piece spanning the entire width of the car, taking up a lot of space, and two smaller pieces attached on both sides, taking up</p>

<p>— Fu</p>
<p>The local Da Xia Automobile Company recently received a telegram from the Studebaker factory stating that at the opening of this year's New York Auto Show, Queen Elisabeth of Greece purchased a Studebaker President Twelve, 175 horsepower, Arrow brand sedan with a wheelbase of 144 inches. The car will be painted deep black, in contrast to the all-white, gold-trimmed Arrow car commissioned by the King of Persia. The only exterior ornament on the car is a small silver crown affixed to the center of both rear doors. In addition, a hole for a flagpole must be drilled in the front left fender.</p>
<p>The interior upholstery must be luxurious and must include a special radio with the speaker hidden at the top of the privacy window. Spare tires and chrome wheels must be installed on the front fenders. The Arrow car's most famous fender headlights of the last ten years are essential.</p>
<p>However, apart from specific equipment, everything else is identical to other Arrow top-of-the-line twelve-cylinder sedans.</p>

<p>less space and connecting to the middle piece, slightly shifted back. Undoubtedly, this method allows passengers an unobstructed view of the scenery ahead. Some manufacturers have adopted steep car roofs this year. In this case, the car body looks like a pure steel box, with the top and body sections completely welded together without using nails. Overall, the car neck extends and stretches under the roof, so the car body structure is very strong. In recent years, the car industry has been using all-steel car bodies solely because external vibrations often cause cars to shake and make noise. By selecting materials that insulate against vibration, this external vibration is now completely eliminated.</p>
<p>(4) Safety Glass</p>
<p>Some car manufacturers use safety glass for the entire car body, while others only use safety glass for the windshield and wind deflectors. If the car owner wants to install safety glass throughout the car, they have to pay extra. However, in the United States, road regulations require all new cars to use safety glass starting in 1935. Each year, the progress made in engine manufacturing is sufficient to increase passenger comfort and driver convenience. Advancements in the chassis have made the seats wider, with both front and rear seats enlarged. The legroom inside the car has also been significantly increased. The purpose is to mount the car body on top so that the weight distribution can be more appropriate. Many car bodies have been moved forward this year, allowing passengers to sit in the middle of the axles. At the same time, the engine has been moved forward, placing more of the overall weight on the front axle. The sole purpose of this method is to make both front and rear passengers feel equally comfortable. We recall that in recent years, rear passengers often felt bumps and vibrations because the seats were precisely positioned above the rear axle. However, this will no longer be the case. Both front and rear doors are larger than in previous years. The overall height of this year's new cars has changed little. However, in many vehicles, the space inside the car from the floor to the middle of the roof is significantly wider.</p>
<p>(5) Louvered Windows</p>
<p>The latest louvered windows have become popular this year. They are generally arranged as a row of holes distributed along the entire length of the roof. However, some arrange many short louvered windows in a long row, and even use chrome trim around the louvered windows for decoration, while emphasizing streamlining. Spare tires are hidden in many new cars because a section at the rear can completely cover the tires. The only reason for this is to allow the car manufacturers to make the car body unimpeded to the rear. However, some new cars still use the old method of leaving the spare tire exposed at the rear or placing it in a channel on the side fender. In addition, some new cars combine the rear luggage rack and tire rack, installing hinges so that a tire can be added in addition to luggage. (End)</p>

<h3 id="e254">The Lineup of the British Automotive Industry in 1935 <a href="#e254" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c254" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">254</a></h3>
<p>— Qin</p>
<p>In recent years, the British automotive industry has shown a firm determination to compete with the American automotive industry. This is particularly evident in 1935. To encourage the automotive industry, the American government decided to reduce the automotive industry tax rate by 20% in 1935 to expand production. The British government also reduced the automotive tax by 20%. Automotive entrepreneurs have also expressed their intention to compete with the United States. Therefore, the British automotive industry in 1935 has a grand plan for development, far from being second to the American automotive industry as it was in the past.</p>
<p>The center of the British automotive industry, the Midlands, is like Detroit in the United States. The various automobile factories in the Midlands are currently in a state of active production. The Standard Motor Company is particularly hard at work. Because sales of Standard cars have increased in the past, the factory does not have enough workers and is recruiting new workers for manufacturing. In addition, the renowned Triumph automobile factory also decided to expand its manufacturing division in 1935 and recruit 30% more new workers. Recruitment has officially begun in London.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Rolls-Royce Motor Company will also have new developments in 1935. In 1934, the factory's business was very satisfactory, performing better than the previous year, with profits reaching £199,300. The factory is most famous for manufacturing automobile engines. The reason British cars can achieve a considerable position in the world's high-record cars is largely due to the application of engines manufactured by this factory. The factory has a history of 20 years in the British automotive industry and also manufactures marine engines. It is a very comprehensive machinery manufacturing business. In 1935, it will adopt various novel mechanical raw materials. The factory's greatest cylinder manufacturing department has added more than 200 engineers. (To be continued)</p>
