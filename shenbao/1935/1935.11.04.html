<h3 id="c11">財部頒布緊急法令 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>財政部為救濟目前我國經濟危機起見。參照各國先例。頒布緊急法令。自今日起。以中央·中國·交通·三銀行所發行之鈔票。定為法幣。所有完糧納稅及一切公私欵項之收付。槪以法幣為限。不得行使現金。違則全數沒收。以防白銀之偷漏。並設立發行準備管理委員會。辦理法幣準備金之保管及其發行收換事宜。此項辦法為我國貨幣上空前之大改革。全國人民。無論在都市或鄉村。無一不深受此項改革之影響。此誠國民政府成立以來。最有重大意義之設施也。</p>
<p>我國久處次殖民地地位。國民經濟備受帝國主義列强之壓迫。非惟無可發展。抑且日趨凋敝。近年遍世界之經濟恐慌。使各主要國家。不得不相繼放棄金本位。因此世界銀價暴漲。我國幣値從而抬高。致造或通貨緊縮之象。工商破產。層見迭出。資金日見外流。國際收支陷於不利狀態。去年十月十五日。政府雖下令徵收銀出口稅。及平衡稅而因貨幣價値。始終昂貴之故。現銀仍不免於逃避。今者財部毅然實施此項久經考慮之貨幣政策。無非為防止現銀存底外流罄盡計耳。</p>
<p>雖然。現銀外流。其重要癥結。實在國內產業衰落。外貨傾銷政府今次貨幣政策。固可促進民族產業之發展。收成效於一時。然根本救濟之道。要仍在維護本國產業。不使更受外國勢力之摧殘也。</p>
<p>抑政府此項政策之實施。其直接影響當為物價暴漲。各業低薪職工。或將不能勉維其生活。此則有關社會安寗政府當能作適當之處置者。至於投機商人。乘機爭購外匯。觀於最近數日標金之狂漲。可知亦屬意料中事。若然。則其為害實不可勝言。所幸財部已令中央·中國·交通·三銀行儘量買賈外匯。以謀金價之安定。此後標金市塲殆可避免投機家之操縱矣。</p>

<h3 id="c33">意阿的軍事形勢 <a href="#c33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— 仲持</p>
<p>——地理方面的觀察</p>
<p>一</p>
<p>震動世界的意阿戰爭從開火到如今，整整的一個月了。機械化的意大利大軍苦戰了三晝夜，方才把阿比西尼亞的邊境要鎭阿杜華攻下。一八九六年意軍在該鎭敗北的奇恥總算是洗雪了。此後的戰事，除了阿杜華鄰近的阿克森聖城繼續失陷以外，在意軍方面簡直沒有獲得什歷顯著的勝利。據最近電訊，北路兩軍正在泰喀士河以北瑪克爾一帶劇戰，南路兩軍還在沃加登區域華爾華爾附近相持。就算蒂格里省和沃加登區域全都落到墨索里尼的手裏了，意軍也不過獲得了初步的勝利。更重要更困難的在腹地的决戰還在後面呢。</p>
<p>講到腹地的戰爭，意軍方面是不見得有多大把握的。原來意軍只在飛機，坦克，大砲等等武器上顯着優勢。而這等近代武器在崇山峻嶺的阿比西尼亞腹地，就得失掉了大部分的效能。同時就士氣，尤其是就地勢看來，最後的勝利也許會屬於阿軍的。現在單從阿比西尼亞地理上的特點，來檢討一番意阿戰爭的大勢。</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>這次意大利大舉侵略阿比西尼亞，最先是從它的北路軍事根據地伊里特里進兵的。這一狹長的沿紅海的地帶，氣候溫和，適於歐洲人居住，而且中部高原接連着阿比西尼亞高原，是意大利向南進攻的現成的立脚點，然而伊里特里也有一個極大的缺點，就是雨量稀少，差不多終年亢旱。因此這地方簡直什麽物產都沒有，不過在經濟地位上，足以控制北部阿比西尼亞少許的出海貿易罷了。</p>
<p>意大利從這塊磽瘠的殖民地上顯然得不到多少經濟的利益，因此它垂涎到接連着的阿比西尼亞高原地帶。這是在阿比西尼亞全境唯一適於白種人殖民的區域，不但土地比較肥沃，而且氣候也相當溫和。信基督敎操亞木哈拉語的阿此西尼亞人都聚居在那裏，統治周圍各色種族的人民。我們不妨用拔海五千英尺以上的整塊面積來代表這一高原地帶。這中間超過一萬英尺的高山很多，在北部的山甚至有高到一萬五千英尺光景的。在高原的東端，地勢陡然降低，是一片大沙漠。這廣漠的低原，叫做唐拿克爾區域，是斷層谷（Rift　Valley）的北部。唐拿克爾區域有若干部分低到海平綫以下。這可說是全世界最荒凉的地方了。向來只有兩個歐洲的旅隊曾經安全地通過了這區域。其一旅隊的領袖納爾別忒（Ludovio　Nerbitt）給過它「陰間的陷穽」這一個名稱。斷層谷愈南愈窄，便形成了隔開阿此西尼亞本部高原和索謀里高原的地溝。從這斷層谷的南叚攀登中央高原比較北一帶容易得多。十六世紀的迦拉人便是從那里侵入阿比西尼亞的。</p>
<p>阿比西尼亞北部地形上的特點是通過高原的太喀士河及其支流所形成的深深的地溝。這些河道往往深到半英里光景，上面沒有一道橋樑，這才切斷了侵略者從北向南的進路。伊里特里的意軍除了經由阿杜華一帶向東南進擊以外，簡直沒有方法深入阿比西尼亞。所以意軍佔領了阿杜華，便繞着該鎮東南的高山邊緣進攻瑪加爾和麥格達拉。這條路綫，就是一八六八年意軍侵略阿比西尼亞的老路。</p>
<p>這一路意軍的主要目標實在是查那湖以東和以北的高山。從這些高山發源的有東蘇丹和埃及的農地賴以灌漑的亞脫白拉河，太喀士河和藍尼羅河。假如意軍控制了這些河流的來源，尤其是藍尼羅河的大蓄水池，查那湖，那麽它不但容易征服阿比西尼亞，還可以制埃及和東蘇丹的死命。</p>
<p>然而意軍要達到這樣的目的是非常困難的。第一，，這方面的進攻路綫，經過許多崇山峻嶺和難渡的峽谷，差不多完全沒有適當的道路和必要的橋梁。非等通到後方伊里特里的公路逐段造好，沿路的峽谷架設了橋梁，摩托化的意軍無法前進。造橋築路以及其他軍事工程所用的材料大都得從遠地方運來。隨軍而進的路工所趕造的橋梁兵站和山路，卽使完成了，也還有隨時給猝不及防的山洪冲毀的危險。第二。阿比西尼亞高原的羣山中間，平原很少。除了查那湖區域以及其他幾個湖泊的盆地，不容易找到可供大軍駐紮的根擄地。這樣的地勢只適於游擊戰而不適於現代戰術。游擊是阿比西尼亞人所擅長的。一八九六年，他們就靠這一種戰術，在阿杜華獲得過光榮的勝利。意軍愈是深入了高原地帶就愈得提防被阿比西尼亞游擊隊包圍襲擊或是截斷聯絡。第三，阿此西尼亞的農產物只够供給阿比西尼亞人簡陋生活的需要。歐洲的遠征軍很不容易從那裏覓得所需的糧食和日用品。意軍的各種軍需實際上幾乎全得從海外運上高原去。不但運費極大，而且這也是一個困難的間題。</p>
<p>三</p>
<p>現在再就南路的軍事形勢，來檢討一番罷。這方面意軍的根據地意屬索謀里蘭跟伊里特里有着顯然的不同。這是東菲廣大的半沙漠區域的一部分。英屬法屬的索謀里蘭和阿比西尼亞的東北部東南部都包括在那半沙漠區域以內。意屬索謀里蘭靠近赤道，氣候炎熟得往往使白種人受不住。土着百萬餘，差不多全過着原始的農業和遊牧的生活。境內朱巴河和韋白西貝里河發源於北方的高原。意軍從海口馬加狄許開往阿比西尼亞，要不是從這兩河上去，就得通過了二百英里荒沙地帶，方才見到華爾華爾，傑洛古比等處的泉井。這些泉井在軍事上的價値是顯然的。</p>
<p>日前意阿兩軍在沃加登區域的劇戰，就爲的是爭奪這些泉井。然而有着少許泉井的沃加登區域在墨索里尼也並不瞧在眼裏。他是說過不要做「不毛地」的收藏家的。他在南路軍事上的初步目標還是哈拉爾省索謀里高原北部的幾個險要地點。意軍目前正要利用華爾華爾和傑洛古比作爲軍事根據地向那方面進攻如果佔據了索謀里高原的險要，意軍便獲得兩項重大的利益：（一）意軍可以控制意屬索謀里蘭兩大河流域的全部，（二）意軍可以控制斷層谷的哈伏西河部分；阿京到直布底的鐵路就從那裏經過。卽使這條阿比西尼亞通海的唯一要道沒有被意軍佔領，意軍從索瑪里高原北部的險要總可以完全控制它。</p>
<p>然而南路意軍的進展也有着幾種困難，就是天熱路遠，飲水缺乏。而且同北路一樣，一面行軍，一面必須築造汽車路，從前綫直通到印度洋，否則接濟上就要感到不便。卽使一路沒有遇到加拉人和就地回敎部落劇烈的抵抗，意軍居然佔據了阿比西尼亞東部或東南部的低地和略高的地帶，也還有高原山嶺的天險不容易攻破呢。</p>
<p>四</p>
<p>墨索里尼雖然打算着在這一晴季以內攻下整個阿比西尼亞。然而從這一被侵略國的地理形勢看來，他的願望恐怕難以貫澈罷。况且一月來阿軍奮勇抵抗的情形正瞪明着阿比西尼亞人的確是善戰的民族。他們雖然缺少着近代武器。但是憑着天險憑着勇敢的衛國精神，倒也抵擋得住外來的强敵。他們有着那麽難攻的地勢，同時又能十分適應當地的環境。無論如何，這是意軍方面及不上他們的重要軍事條件。阿比西尼亞人能够每天跑二十五到四十英里崎嶇的山路，接連許多天不覺得疲乏。他們養着本地種騾子並不需要好好的飼料，可是又敏捷，又耐勞，能够把機槍和小山砲搬運到無論怎樣險峻的地點，阿軍用着這些武器，可以造成强固的防綫，使意軍無可奈何。</p>
<p>如果意軍不能在晴季以內把侵阿的軍事結束，那麽一到雨季，戰爭就非停頓或者延宕不可了。爲什麼呢？因爲阿比西尼亞境內，拔海六〇〇〇英尺以下的地方，到處有着一種黃泥，在晴季乾結而且鬆脆，一下雨就變成肥皂漿一般的泥淖，簡直連路都走不來。坦克隊到黃泥區域，如果碰着一陣暴雨就不免陷在泥淖里，必須等到太陽晒乾了泥土，方才可以移動。</p>
<p>意阿戰爭過了這一睛季也許會演變爲持久的遊擊戰的罷。利此亞的息里內易卡可不是有過二十年光景的游擊戰的麽？那地方還離意大利近得多，而且回敎的居民還不到二十萬呢。這次意軍侵阿的戰事果眞也持久下去，那麽意國方面得不償失的軍費的消耗和人民的犧牲說不定會在國內引起嚴重問題來的。</p>

<p>— 金華亭</p>
<p>從這裏可以曉得牛奶的歷史和優劣</p>
<p>近年以來，牛奶一項，在吾國食品中，已經占了很廣大的地位了，就拿上海一部來講，無論西菜館餅干廠以及各大旅館俱樂部娛樂場等處，每天都要採用多量的牛奶，同時一般家庭直接向各牛奶公司訂飲的，恐怕要佔全市牛奶產量每天三萬餘磅的百分之六十以上，從這樣看來，牛奶用途的廣汛，是無異議了，但是一般的人們，僅知牛奶是爲一種富有多量的營養素，而爲有益於身體的食品，但對於牛奶產生的一切經過情形和牛奶的好壞，大多數人不能明瞭，至於那種叫A字牛奶，那種叫B字牛奶，以及牛奶當中所含的成分是什麽，純潔不純潔，吃消毒牛奶與人的身體有什麼益處，吃不消毒牛奶與人的身體有什麼害處，因爲現在上海牛奶塲已經很多，其中合乎工部局與市衛生局檢騐條例的，固然很多，可是不合檢騐條例，甚至於沒有受檢騐的，到也不在少數，如果不愼，吃到劣質牛奶，不但無益而且有害，記者因爲這個緣故，所以特地到負有盛名成績最好的自由農塲去視察過一次，現在把視察所得的各種情形，詳細的分紀於後。</p>
<p>全塲巡禮</p>
<p>我們一行七人，是日下午三時半，就到達了康腦脫路自由農塲，塲長尤懷臯先生，偕同該塲創辦的「家庭服務社」主任沈國棠先生，很慇懃的招待我們，爲着容易明瞭和節省時間起見，首先作一個全塲的巡禮。</p>
<p>一，牛棚　全棚共有奶牛一百二十頭，塲作長方的H形，正中是甬道，甬道左右，共裝鐵欄四行，每格栓牛一頭，這些牛雖然在每格拴繫着，仍舊可以進退行動自由，兩邊爲喂料道，每天早晨七時，下午二時，晚間十時，三次喂料，一面喂料，一面就擠奶，所以擠奶，每天亦是三次，管牛工人，以六人爲一組，每組四個上手兩個下手，一共管理奶牛四十頭，另外一人專門量牛的溫度，檢騐奶牛有無疾病，一人專門管理食料，全棚設工頭一人，以便督促管理全棚工人，尢君說牛棚建築有一定的尺寸，最要緊的整個塲地，要比塲外街心地面高三英寸，牛棚又要比全部塲地高六英寸，使各項水量，易於流出，不致囤積，牛棚內全闊三十四尺，他如牛欄·甬道·喂料道·水道·都有一定的尺寸，棚屋兩旁及屋頂，都用窗門，使空氣流通，光綫明亮。、全世界奶牛種類很多，但是產量最富，營養素較多的，以下列四種爲最好。</p>
<p>（甲）何爾斯丁牛，Hoistein何爾斯丁牛爲乳牛當中最有歷史的，它在一千年前，已經傳播歐州了，發源地是嗬囒，現在的比利時·嗬囒·德意志·美利堅等國的牛乳塲，都有它們的踪跡，牠的身軀帶黑白色，體量很大，普通重量約在一千三百磅，亦有一千五百到一千七百磅，性子非常的馴良，產乳量比任何一種乳牛都要高，不過脂肪成分極少，油球亦小，提油工作亦難些，可是牠的蛋白質很多，拿牠哺喂小孩，最好也沒有了</p>
<p>（乙）者爾西牛，Jesey者爾西乳牛據考證說，它的發源地是在瑞士，是南歐一個頂好的乳牛代表，這種牛現在全世界都有牠的踪跡，每一頭大約有九百多磅重，雄的竟有一千三百到七百磅重，性子很馴，所產的牛奶普通含有百分之五分半的脂肪，有時竟到百分之六七，在十六磅到十九磅的牛乳中，就可以提出一磅的牛油來，而且油球很大，提油比較容易，這種牛要算乳牛中最精選的了。</p>
<p>（丙）格爾西牛，Cuernsey格爾西牛是從嗬囒格爾西島傳出來的，從前在歐州不過貴族的人們所用的，所以不很普及，現在美國牛塲就非常之多格爾西牛體格要比者爾西牛胖些，電量約在一千另五十磅到一千二百五十磅，它很耐寒，而且很聰敏，產量比較者爾西多，但是牛油的成分，沒有者爾西高，這等牛每年能產六千到九千磅的牛乳。</p>
<p>（丁）埃爾賽牛，Asshire埃爾賽乳牛模樣最好，但是在選擇的歷史中，牠最年輕，在十八世紀的時候，牠在蘇格蘭的想而地方，有些農民都嫌牠太小太瘦，產乳量亦低，牠們就從荷蘭國裏運些別的種來混合，結果選成愛爾斯乳牛來，乳牛重量大約一千磅左右，雄牛大約一千五百磅光景，因爲從野性改良出來的，年代又不多，性子很暴，所以很難服侍，這種牛目前還在精密選擇改良中，所以牛奶的產量，亦不及他種之多。</p>
<p>自由農塲所有的乳牛，共有三種，第一種就是何爾斯丁，第二種是者爾西，第三種是非純種，據尤先生說，這三種乳牛，都是外國種，有的從美國買來，有的從坎那大買來，有的從本地生長的，每頭的買價，約從五百元到七百元之間，（國幣）三種乳牛當中，產量以何爾斯丁爲最高，脂肪以者爾西爲最多，全塲總產量，在冬季春季每日產一千六百到一千八百磅，夏秋季每日產一千磅至一千二百磅。</p>
<p>二，洗瓶部從牛棚經冷氣部，轉到洗瓶部，洗瓶一項，在牛奶塲中，是很重要的一部工作，所有曾經用過的牛奶瓶，要經過三次的滌洗，四步工作，第一步滌洗去污油，第二步將瓶套在機器上擦去內外的油漬，第三步洗清，第四步將洗清奶瓶送入蒸汽間，用華氏表二百度的熱度煮十五分鐘，然後送到隔壁瓶部，此外還有盛牛奶的大小鉛桶，亦要用同樣的滌洗蒸煮鍋才能用，而且這種鉛桶，都是用原塊的鉛質拷成，並無鑲　之縫隙，以防其他的污穢東西傳入。</p>
<p>三，消毒部最後到消毒部，這部的工作最要緊，正中有一產燒奶鍋，鍋的前面裝有一檔一檔的凉奶機，牛奶從奶牛身上擠下以後，就用上述的鉛桶，轉送到消毒間，傾入牛奶鍋中，讓它燒煮，要煮到華氏表一百四十五度，至多到一百四十八度半，爲最適宜，時間爲三十分鐘，如果不到這個溫度，牛奶當中的「大腸微菌一，就不能完全撲滅，若是過了這個溫度，半奶當中的生活素，又名「維太命」，受到影響，這種牛奶的營養料，亦就减少了，所以這當中要設一只「自動記錄溫度表」，每日用自動記錄表格一張，指示牛奶是否熱到一百四十五度，及已否經過三十分鐘，從消毒器用磅浦將牛奶轉送到涼奶機，涼奶機是扁的，使牛奶經過該管時，成功很薄的範國，牛奶就凉到四十五度，然後用裝瓶機將牛奶裝入瓶內，隨手封蓋起來，因用機製封蓋的緣故，所以工人的手指，絕對不能接觸，末了送到冷藏室，使牛奶的溫度，逐步的降低，使牛奶中的牛奶微生蟲，不致發育生存。劣等者淘汰，近年牛奶事業有長足進步，應當歸功於工部局，因爲沒有他的提倡與推進，恐怕到今日也不能得到這良好的牛奶，因爲八年前牛奶事業是極爲幼稚，今日的牛奶事業，已成爲科學化的牛奶事業了。</p>
<p>二，「A」字牛奶與「B」字牛奶的分別在牛奶的成分方面，A字B字是一樣的，其不同的地方，完全在於純粹的衛生問題，所以A字牛奶，一，要有全部的衛生設備，二，是技術精明的管理人才與訓練純熟的工作助手，三，是要有主管機關精密的監督與指導，三者缺一不可，因爲沒有設備，决不能產生及格的A字牛奶，譬如說有了蒸氣設備了，然後才能使牛奶本身及牛奶所接觸的器物用具消毒，再有了冷汽設備，才能使牛奶中細菌不致發育，而發酵變味，但是有了設備，沒有相當技術的人才來使用，這設備也是無用，但是有了設備與人才，而沒有所謂主管機關來監督檢查，也是無用，因爲細菌是肉眼看不見的，必須要經過化騐以後才能知道牛奶的內容，這是最重要的一部工作，檢騐以後，就可確定A字牛奶的資格，所以A字牛奶是受主管機關經過醫師化騐及各的牛乃，B字牛乃是不七念的，所以A字牛奶是可以冷飲，B字牛奶冷飲是不安全的。</p>
<p>三，三種不同的查騐工作</p>
<p>甲，牛塲的視察要把牛奶在上海普遍的通行銷售，是要向三處衛生局領取執照的，公共租界衛牛處，管規則有三十條，消毒規則有九條，市衛生局及法租界衛生局各有十九條，凡關於環境及乳牛的淸潔，房屋的建築，溝泄她暢，機器的設備，工作是否合法，用水是否安全，以及工作人員的健康問題，莫不包括在內，大約爲歷史的關係，公共租界衛生處，是居於頒袖的地位，大半工作，是衛生處負責辦理，衛生員常常不分晝夜，負這視察的工作，但是不久的將來，恐怕在華界的牛奶公司，，要完全由市衛生局負責視察，聞得已一二處牛奶或羊奶公司，向由衛生處管理的，現已放棄這種責任與市衛生局了。</p>
<p>專家談話</p>
<p>我們在全塲巡禮完畢以後，又回到會客室，他們很客氣的預備了牛奶和紅茶，和各種細點，還有他們自己做的牛奶蛋糕，非常可口，我們吃過茶點之後，尤先生就開始關於牛奶技術上的談話。</p>
<p>一，上海牛奶分等的種類牛奶在上海雖分AB種的等級，但有四種不同的種類，一是A字消毒，二是B字不消毒，三是A字消毒，四是B字不消毒，這個分等的辦法，不過行了八年，是工部局衛生處定出來的，是一種鼓勵改進牛奶事業之政策，使優良者生存，</p>
<p>（乙）奶牛的檢查奶牛的檢騐有二種，一種是定期的普遍檢騐，一種是肺結核檢騐，都由公共租界衛生處負責辦理，不取任何費用，A字牛奶公司的奶牛，是每三個月檢騐一次，B字牛奶公司的奶牛，每六個月檢騐一次，倘然在奶滬上騐出肺結核症來，這只奶牛就要命令宰殺，毫不通融，因爲在肺部的肺結核，不易傳佈，而在乳部的肺結核，是要傳到牛奶中去的，肺結核以前是不檢騐的，自從一九二八年，因爲上海市政府衛生局獸醫王兆麒博士，要辦理檢騐手續，工部局才聘請康乃爾大學學業的獸醫舒叔培博士，實行檢騐奶牛，並不取費，從此以後，上海的牛乳事業，大有進步，但是檢騐後的結果，却是驚人，方始曉得全上海的乳牛中，到有百分之五十至八十，有肺癆病，爲補救這個缺點，一方面是設法逐步减少肺癆牛，一方面將牛奶全部消森，因爲消毒以後，就無問題了，所以關於B字牛奶，工部局在去年曾發起共同組織中央牛奶消毒廠，以便將B字牛奶，全數消毒，以謀市民，飲奶的安全，後來因爲種種原因，未能成功，工部局爲始終貫澈他的牛奶必須消毒的主張，才另訂章程，所有全上海B字牛奶，限於一九三六年六月三十日止，務必辦理消毒工作，否則卽令停北營業，這是英租界方面的情形，華法二界，同時亦舉行檢騐的工作。</p>
<p>（丙）牛奶的檢騐牛奶也有二種不同的檢騐，（一）是成分的檢騐，牛奶當中沒有大腸菌，吃了固然不會生病，但是是否得了牛奶的滋補，還是問題，在上海比較進步的都市，當然有衛生機關派員考察奶塲是否合法，牛奶是否合乎條例，在這種情形之下，當然用不着顧慮了，但是試看現在的國內，究有幾處設立衛生機關來管理這些事情，那麼我們出了代價，訂購牛奶，亦應該曉得靠得住靠不住，衛生不衛生，明白這些疑問，我們要先把牛奶原有成分弄淸楚，再看攙了別的東西以後會不會有化學的變化，牛奶內含有四種大原素，其成分如下，</p>
<p>（一）水分約佔百分之八十八</p>
<p>（二）脂肪（卽奶油）約佔百分之四</p>
<p>（三）蛋白質等約佔百分之八</p>
<p>（四）礦物或炭質約佔百分之〇·九</p>
<p>工部局衛生處管理之下，攙水一層，不成問題，所以飲牛奶，應當注意的，到在乎一種肉眼看不見的微生蟲，至於普通用牛奶表來測騐牛奶的成分，必須要在牛奶溫度六十度，方可準確，否則牛奶熱度高了，牛奶表就要浮起，二，是細菌的檢騐，牛奶中要檢騐二種細菌，第一種是牛奶細菌，規定每一個CC，普通不得過念萬，（這就是A字不消毒牛奶的規定）消毒之後，每一個CC中不得過三萬，（這就是A字消毒牛奶的規定）第二種是糞穢細菌，卽標準細菌，又名大腸細菌，用他來測騐各種病菌的存在，規定十分之一CC中，不能發現此項細菌，如果發現，第一次工部局卽予以照例的警吿書，同時飭令查究改良，若不卽查究其根源，而故意犯至數次者，工部局有權把A字牛奶執照暫時取銷，牛奶如有攙水，工部局就要提起公訴處罰了，若是始終不改良，而且常常違章，旣取銷執照，停止營業，</p>
<p>因爲肺病奶牛之不能絕跡，空氣中接觸上都有傳佈病症的危險，所以這消毒的益處與不消毒的害處，是顯而易見的了，那末牛奶的好壞不全在質地的濃厚，因爲在工部局管理之下，攙水的問題，已成過去的事跡，絕對不致發生，而牛奶中看不見的細菌，使人生病的細菌，到是極大的問題，所以要牛奶的純潔，安全，衛生，是由設備，人才，與檢騐，三者合一的產生物，是缺一不可的，（未完）</p>

<p>經濟專刊標金暴漲的內幕及其因果  張一凡　　「一」　　鑽在金屬本位牛角尖裏的貨幣制度，企圖要建立一種永久不變的價値尺度，至少要是一個比較穩定的價値尺度，那種希望的微細，與可能的渺小，是早被貴金屬物價暴漲暴落的事實所證實了。　　如果人們因習於用金，故不得不根據此種習慣，而去企圖創造一種眞正可供價値尺度的新貨幣。這種情形實在像陷入爛泥潭裏的人，並不想法爬到岸上去（一跳上岸，事實上也辦不到的，所以只有想法爬上去，）而儘是在原地方用力掙扎，企圖自拔，結果，除了愈趨愈下，死而巳矣之外，是再也沒有其他收獲可希望的。　　不是嗎？金貴銀賤的風潮，還不過是像前天一般的事。而今日的銀貴金賤的風潮，又快要成爲昨天的事了。目前所出現的我國匯價的慘跌，上海金價的急騰，又似暴風驟雨一般地降臨了。　　在金貴銀賤的時候，大家因爲深切地感覺到當時的物價大漲，生活負擔日重，以及各種進步的生產工具之進價過高，與國際收支上的損失綦大，所以便盛倡禁金出口，或主張逐漸採行金本位制度，他們一致地以爲唯有如此，才能盡量運用現代的生產技術來振興國內的產業。在輕减人民的生活負擔來富裕社會與國家，同時國際收支時，也始得避免此種無妄之損失。　　這種計劃雖沒有實現，其實也幸虧沒有實現，可是金價重行崩跌的希望，在僅僅短短的兩年之後，就立刻獲得了。但是因爲這次金價的跌落過火，銀價的回昇太大，於是國內存銀紛紛出口，各地金融恐慌，隨銀根驟緊而勃發。同時物價相反的跌落，生產者十虧九空，於是全國驚恐，又盛倡禁銀出口，貶低幣値，以及提出留戀於金屬本位的種種對策。有的事實上已經實現，有的事實上也巳準備着實現，在這個時候，大家又以爲唯有如此，才能使物價回昇，使產業得以維持。因而回過頭去，對於二十年份金貴銀賤的風潮，非特不復感覺到有害，而且還幾乎一致地認爲唯其銀賤金貴「才能使中國得以避免遍及世界的經濟恐慌」，並有指當時實爲「中國繁榮的時期」。　　這種感覺矛盾的現象，與其謂爲我國的貨幣沒有一個中心的政策。毌寗謂爲只在各自替主觀的利益打算所致。　　不滿意於金貴銀賤的人羣，主要的是買辦階級，跟摩登朋友，及外債纍纍的機關，因爲金貴銀賤，外匯慘跌，於是輸入物價急騰，買辦生意大受打擊，於是一般摩登朋友，便不能充分地享受「現代的物質文明」。同時償付外債，要支出更多的銀幣去符合以金價結算的債務，便深感於收支不敷的恐慌。　　可是到了銀貴金賤的相反情形時，對此不滿意的又換過另一種人羣，主要的是金副資本和產業資本，在銀本位國家間的金融資本，代表其財富的，主要者便是銀價。銀價昂貴，照例是使他們的財富提高，無形間增加了他的利益。但可憐的，國內存銀，大部份操於在華的外商銀行之手。他們目擊海外銀價高於中國，爲自己的利益所在，自必運現出口以求其差利，現銀外流的聲勢一大，國內的通貨便驟然緊縮，於是各地銀根奇緊，產業紛粉破產，民族的金融資本，便受至二重打擊，第一是通貨膨脹的威脅，唯恐一旦膨脹，外商銀行乘機壓迫華商銀行；第二是受產業破產的影響，使其放出的欵項，本息皆無法收回。在產業資本方面，所受的打擊更鉅；第一滙價飛漲，輸入物價低而輸出物價漲，加强了國際資本主義者的經濟壓侵；第二，以銀計算的國內批發物價，相對的跌落，削减了他的利澗之外，且復有虧蝕其成本的危險。第三，各地現銀外流，銀根奇緊，因此籌碼短促，捉襟見肘，旣難於再作發展的計劃，甚至連維持現狀都憂憂乎難哉！　　可是那批佔國民總人口最大多數的農業生產者及勞苦大眾，無論是金貴銀賤或銀貴金賤，都同樣的遭受無妄之災。在金貴銀賤的時候，農產品輸出物價的崩跌，無形削减了他的收入；在國內物價的回昇趨勢上，農產品較工產品遲緩，這剪刀口又加重了他收支上的苦痛。在銀貴金賤的相反現象之下，則在各國的關稅壁壘之外，又實行貶値侵銷，團家代負其損失的責任，因此提高了輸出物價的我國農產品，便消失了海外剩餘的一角市塲，弄到到處碰壁。同時國內的物價之崩跌，農產品的跌勢又較工產品來得兇猛，因此農民所受的打擊，又比別人來得嚴厲。最近有不少的偉論名著，在說明中國今日的經濟恐慌，皆由於銀價暴漲暴落的景響，這雖然不免抹煞了其他的各種成因，却也不能否諱其關係的重要。　　至於都市間的那批勞苦大衆，及食薪階級與自由職業者，那未在金貴銀賤的塲合，感受「米珠薪貴」「生活維艱」的切身苦痛。因爲當時的物價抬高，而工資及薪俸的收入，依然站在低微的水準上不動。反是，在銀貴金賤的塲合，生活負擔是比較减輕了，但實質工資也同時　減輕。尤其因產業的紛紛破產，使他們藉以糊口的職業，也無法維持，而加入了失業羣中，於是物價縱然下降，於他們依然無涉。　　退一步說，不論是金貴銀賤，或銀賤金貴。總還能給與一部份人以相當的利益。但可憐的是，這種利益的命運，却操之於他人之手，我們只能依人浮沉，由人排佈而已。試觀目前全國已在銀貴金賤的恐怖之下，僅僅在最近一星期內，上海的標金與外滙市價，已一反過去的現象，昨日（十月三十日）的上海標金市價，已打開了從古以來所未曾有過的最新高價，而每條竟値一千一百八十三元之鉅。與美國尙未實行購銀政策之前的一千元左右，也非可同日而語，甚至較二十一年份的最高價一千一百六十九元也大得多。如再以與民十九年前的經常在四五百元的市價上比較，簡直恍如隔也。因此高聳的我國滙價，也一瀉而下，各種物價，便開始飛升了。銀價計算後的輸入物價，將高於土產，而金價計算後的輸出物價，則將在海外開始大跌。在二十年左右，各國的關稅壁壘，若無今日的嚴密；同時各國的貶價侵銷的工具，也不如今日的完備。那時我國的輸出貿易旣並未獲得多大幸運；而我國的輸入貿易，却也並未表示若何的减少。到了現在，我們倒反能企望藉以增進輸出遏制輸入，豈不是痴人說夢？今日所指彼時的「繁榮」原屬一種「幻想」而已。現在再想建立希望在道「幻想」之上，不啻是在「自欺欺人」！　　有人說，這次標金的狂漲，是發動於我國對外匯價的跌落，一般的觀察，以爲我國外滙的崩跌，由於實行通貨膨脹的空氣所造成。（趙蘭坪先生在今天發表的「滙價下落金價暴騰以後一文中雖未明言，却也含有這種意思」其意以爲這次變動，是出發在我國自動的力量。我們看了英美銀價的坐住不動，獨以銀爲本位的我國貨幣的外滙，却反劇烈地下降，確似合乎事實，但我們却不敢如此樂觀，我們如果注意到在這個時候之內，即在現在滙豐銀行每天所公佈的我國外匯市價，總是比中央銀行掛牌的要低得多，這情形便不能不使我們想到去冬在華外商銀行的大批運銀出口的敎訓，哼，這次的變動，也許又是一個新的陰謀在蘊釀着，行進着吧！　　「二」　　自從美政府在去秋開始購銀程序以來，世界銀價，便畏期的蒸蒸日上。今年以來，羅斯福又數度的加緊購銀程序，變本加厲的高抬收買的售價。於是以銀價表示的標全價格，出現了十九年以來從未有過的新跌風，我國在國際政治上的地位，雖則大有一天不如，天的降落之勢；但是我國的貨幣，竟在國際滙兌市塲上，却表現着驚人的威風。民國二十年份，我國銀幣一元，平均僅合英金一先令，在本年五月，却可以換到一先令八便士一二五，在司七的時間，銀幣百元合美金數，也自二十二元二角四分三，激漲到四十元九角七分二。銀幣百元合日金數，更自四十五元二角一分五邊漲到一百三十五元九角六。對於其他各國的匯率，亦莫不皆然，此種激騰情形，如以指數表之，可有如下的驚人記錄：　　對英匯價　對美匯價　對日匯價　　民二十年　四六·九三　四四·一四　四三·二二　　民二十一　五七·七三　四二·六四　七二·七三　　民二十二　五七·九六　五一·八一　九六·四六　　民二十三　六二·九六　六七·〇五　一〇八·四一　　本年五月份　七八·六八　八一·三一　一三五·九六　　（附註）材料根據中外商業金融彙報二卷八期以十五年爲指數基年，　　本年五月以來，滙市方面，雖未再超過五月份的紀錄，但各月的滙價，去也沒有回至本年二月份以前的狀態。可是僅僅在這最近一星期內，却演出了空前未有的劇變，試將本年以來至今日（十月三十日）止，上海對外的匯價，列舉比較價次：　　本年英匯　英匯　美匯　美匯　日匯　日匯　　份　最高　最高　最高　最低　最高　最低　　一月一七·六三　一六·六三　三六·七五　三四·〇〇　一二五·八　一一九·〇　　二月一八·六三　一七·一三　三七·七五　三四·七五　一三二·八　一二二·三　　三月一九·八八　一八·五〇　三九·五〇　三七·〇〇　一四〇·八　一三一·三　　四月三〇·二五　一八·二五　四〇·八八　三六·五六　一四三·三　一三〇·五　　五月二〇·三八　一九·八八　四一·五〇　四〇·三一　一四三·八　一三〇·五　　六月二〇·〇〇　一九·一三　四一·一三　三九·三八　一四一·五　一三五·〇　　七月一九·七五　一八·〇〇　四〇·五六　三七·一九　一三九·八　一二七·〇　　八月一八·〇〇　一七·二五　三七·一九　三五·七五　一二七·〇　一二一·三　　九月一八·二五　一七·六卅　三七·三一　三六·四四　　十月一八·二五　一五·七五　三七·三一　三二·一五　一三〇·〇　一一二·〇　　從大體上看，我國的外匯，在五月之後，即開始跌落。其間美國政府曾幾度計劃將加緊購銀程序，但事實上迄無顯著的動靜。因此在標金易交所方面，多少是於空頭有利的。但這個還决不够做今日金價反動的根據。　　有人認為這次金價的反動，基於外匯的下降，因此以銀幣計算的金價，便開始了重昇的過程。至於外滙的所以跌落，則以爲我國巳開始着通貨膨脹政策。　　近年我國內地，因對都市的貿易長期入超，故現銀也就長期向都市集中。此種結果，便造成了發行增加的遠因，原是當然的。但是在過去每年的發行總額，至多不過三萬萬元，在去年因國內存銀流出過多，隨市塲上的要求，紙幣的發行量，便有激增的趨勢，根據中外商業金融彙報所載的統計，去年全年的組幣，比前年增加了七千七百餘萬元。尤其在去年底十一月以來，每月的發行額，已增至四萬萬一千數百餘萬元，可是此種現象，到了本年三月以後即不復存在。最近各月的發行趨勢，雖又有增大的現象，但還未達到年初的程度，那末如果說，這次滙價的猛跌，是由於通貨膨脹的結果，那末何以不發生在去年年底今年年初呢？不過紙幣的增大，於滙價的衰落，多少有些關係的。亦决不如一般人所想的那般事大。　　依作者所兒，這次滙價的跌落，實由於標金的崩降，認爲標金的降低，基於滙價的下落，實在是倒果爲因的看法。至於標金跌落的原因，據余所見，實由於下列數因：　　（一）在華外商銀行的利用我國最近時局緊張的謠言，從事對華幣制領導權的爭奪鬥戰，因而似乎在開始一種新的陰謀。否則中國的金市與滙市，總是受國外的市面所支配的，可是這次國外的金價旣沒有漲過一分，銀價也沒有跌過一分，而我國的金價却飛漲了三百元以上，外滙也就同比例地下降，中國的金銀市塲幾乎成爲脫離了世界的市場而獨立，簡直是駭人聽聞的事。如果中國自己能有這樣的力量，控制這樣與世界市塲有密切關係的市價，中國也就不該有今日的恐慌。　　（二）中國禁銀出口人，國際收支，槪用現金淸算。現金輸出大增，金匯供需不免失調。　　（三）國內紙幣發行相當的增加，國內雖則每紙幣一元，仍可照票面十足兌現，但陰謀搗亂的人，很可以散放通貨膨脹的流言，使人引起國幣價格與銀價感到離心的恐怖。同時貶抑幣値的呼聲，目下又盛行國內之朝野，尤足以被人借題發揮。從事中傷，故以國幣元所表示的標金價格，乃易於被投機朋友所操縱。　　（四）在時局緊張人心慌亂，復加以陰謀者有計劃的搗亂，必然地可以形成劇烈的投機風氣，投機之風一開，交易所的市面，便足以陷入畸形的發展之中。現在我們試把這四種成因，略加分析如下：　　對於滙兌沒有統制的國家，每當時局緊張，損人利已的別國，必設法打擊其貨幣的外滙而從中取利。我國經濟機構的不健全，是不消說的；而目前又碰到了一個新的危機，也是無可諱言的。國際的兩大貨幣集團對華爭奪幣制的領導權，又早被人所揭發無遺了的事，在此也毌需再說。我們現在只要將最近上海滙豐銀行的掛牌和中央銀行的掛牌所表示的兩種高低差距極大的事實來對照一下，我們便可以知道這次外滙跌落，是受那一方面的策動了。　　這次標金的漲風，在月初就開始，所以我國的滙價，在那時就開始了軟弱。但劇烈的變動，是在月中開始的，所以我們就將最近半月來雙方牌示的價格比較一下，就可以知道

<p>春秋點滴  （嚴懋德）　　靑年人用了「堅决的意志」當作資本，去從事事業的，必能獲得成功；比那些以金錢爲從事事業的資本家的靑年爲多。在在體明出「堅决」可以使人股離貧窮，可以使弱者變成强者，無用成爲有用。　　「勇於向前」是羅士却利特的終身格言，而實則也可以說是在世界上遺留些痕跡的一切的人之格言。白朗寗也說過：「我威風凜凜的勇往直前，有誰敢阻擋我！」　　我不入地獄，誰入地獄？」靑年們！別夢想着有人來拯救我們。要知道，拯救我們只有我們自己。我們要想自拔於苦海的沈淪，便只有靠自己的努力奮鬥去創造。派兵保衛的銀行  佩萸　　自從郵政總局發生鉅劫案後，上海的銀行錢莊都增加警衛，但不見有一家銀行或錢莊，要求派遣一隊武裝兵士來保衛。英京倫敦針綫街的英吉利銀行，雖沒有發生過盜竊案，却有一小隊的兵士，夜間駐紮在行裏，通宵達旦的巡邏。這一小隊的兵士，頭戴峨冠，身穿長服，手執步槍，腰掛彈盒，武器與裝束和英皇宮前的衛兵差不多。他們在傍晚時整隊到行，天明後列隊歸營。銀行用兵士保衛，世界各國中恐不多見　　其實這種預防並不需要的。英吉利銀行每逢裝進大批金條的時候，祇有一二個武裝偵探和一個警察保衛。假使金條是從外洋運來的，那麽運輸手續較多，警衛的人也增加了。例如從南非洲或印度國裝海輪運的，船停泊於桑薩帕登，在天方破曉，乘客尙未起身的時侯，開放艙口，船上的會計員和港口的官員，走進保險間去，先把所委託之物和提單核對，後把所蓋之印詳細檢視，要查到每箱的印，都無改竄痕跡，方稱滿意。經過這樣的檢查手續之後，才能一箱一箱的搬運上岸，裝進停靠在碼頭旁邊，接好車頭的幾輛特別貨車裏。其時車旁有車守和運輸公司的代表，檢點箱數，核對運送單。他們是和金條一起乘車到倫敦去的。四周有幾個武裝警察保衛，另有三個便衣的人在附近徘徊巡查。貨車開抵倫敦車站後，車站月台上已經停靠一輛外表和普通相同的運貨汽車。車傍立一個便衣偵探，一個穿制服的警察，和另外一個運輸公司的代表。他們並不把武器顯露於外，站上看見搬運金條也並不大驚小怪。等到最後一箱金條從貨車上搬下裝進運貨汽車之後，車門就上鎖，風製電馳的開到英吉利銀行去了。雖則保衛並不嚴重，却也未曾遺失過一條金條。藥魚記  淵　　嘗觀「鬥魚」於新閘路和樂里方慎　醫士寓所，此魚產自南洋，長不盈寸，性好鬥，偶以兩尾置一器中，水上戰雲立起。惟是日候之良久竟不鬥，方君謂其中較小之一尾，先晚方以力鬥傷厥鰭，今日恐無餘勇可賈，將取不抵抗主義矣。余觀之良信，遇大魚追逐其後，輙悠然而逝，因戲語方君，此魚惜其體積太小，否則以君之神術，不難以一針恢復其戰鬥力，使之再接再厲也。方君曰：無須此，余有藥。啟篋出一極小之藥丸，溶入水中，是魚吮喞吞吐，不數分鐘，竟鼓腮掉尾而前，觀者莫不稱異。方君曰：是何足異，中國藥看似平淡，而實神奇。以中國醫學之精奧，果能運用得法，參究入微，人猶可以起死回生。况此區區徑寸之魚。歷舉古名醫用藥之奇績，引爲佐證，並謂針藥實有相輔爲用之妙。例如中風一症，固以金針爲最有神效，海上聞人，如曹幼珊周筱卿諸君，經其針治獲愈者，不可以僂指數。然皆挹挹於旣病之後，而最穩妥之方法，莫如以藥防之於未病之先。隨出其研究十餘年所成之預防中風藥「四春至寶丹充示，謂其功用不在金針之下，余以內人體肥多痰，一年來時覺兩腿似被針刺，中西藥均無發大效，因詳詢其服法，歸遺細君。未一月，痛果漸止，痰亦漸稀，眞可謂奏效如神。余向者祇知方君爲金針聖手。而不知其於醫藥學，研討若是之精，因走筆記之如此。脱韁之馬  鴻　持螯常識（下）  天虛我生　　芒硝即瀉鹽，亦能一瀉而止，惟其成分爲硫酸鎂，硫與燐合，益增其毒，非徒無益而又害之，故不可用。前年有以鬰金香酒佐蟹，大開晏會，予秉未達不嘗之訓，目以鬰令香塲入心臟，故不敢赴，並以吿誡獨鶴瘦鵑，然皆無恙，是又足知蟹所忌者，白蘭地與葡萄酒耳。白蘭地乃山葡萄酒蒸溜而成，比之葡萄酒尤進一層，近以南京路購者忽多，或以佐蟹，故亟以吿有同嗜者，欲得美酒以助雅興，則以本社之善哪酒與雙蒸玫瑰酒二種爲最妥，蟹能發氣動風凡有肝風及心胃氣痛病者，每苦患之，惟攻瑰花實爲對症之藥，尋常市售玫瑰多以香精與酒精和水而成，酒精即火酒也，市售膏粱，每以火酒與水混入其中，以輕成本，行家術語，稱之爲「三合酒」而瓶裝之黃酒，則防易壞，且取有力，乃以三合酒羼人其中，俗語所謂「龍虎鬥」者，兇暴可知矣。變蒸政瑰，係用純膏梁浸玫瑰花，蒸溜兩次而成，去凈頭脚，飽和香味，故與普通品不同，所謂頭脚，即在沸點七十八度以上溜出之雜醇，悉屏棄之，故凡一福石爾油」及「阿美兒」與一阿西頓」完全已經提浄，是以絕無臭味，能吸花香，兩次蒸溜，故一杯足抵三杯。善釀酒者，乃以純粳釀成，絕對不　糯秈，藏過一年再復以酒釀酒，不另加水，故味極厚，並不加用焦糖，而色香味三者並佳，藏足六年，始用眞空機裝瓶，故能久藏不壞，逐年釀造，祇以三百壜爲額，擱本六年利息亦頗可觀，故不敢用廣吿宣傳，蓋於西湖博覽會時，一售即聲，午且閙酒荒矣。順筆所至，連　及之，幸勿認爲誇張之辭。惟有一事則敢自誇其有功於世；向來持　濯手，非用肥皂，即用菊花或葉，但其指螺必起歛縮，至感不舒，蟹刺見血，則必潰爛，蟹腥人目，則患蟹眼，或起星翳甚至失明，自從無敵牌牙粉出則以來，無人不知以牙粉擦手，及洗嘴唇，旣能去腥，目不歛縮皮膚，並覺芳香可喜，而牙粉入目，不但無害，目能吸聚眼屎，可於大眼角中引出如綫，患近視者，日習用以擦面尤，能减低席數，是則雖患蟹眼，或能重見光明。至於蟹刺見血，則以牙粉　之，功能止痛消毒，亦足以補蟹譜之一頁歟？遊歙縣太白樓贈別過旭  陳小蝶　　迥溪十六度，靑嶂總凡隨，李白狂如昔，汪倫情更痴，山中相送罷，吾道欲何之，酒楚欺愁種，當前一舉巵和前作原韻  過旭初　　驅車向黃嶽，笠屐曾追隨，靈運謚山賊，虎頭稱書痴，斯人不可作，惟子兩兼之，蒙惠瓊瑤什，愧無靑玉巵。小西天  張恨水著　　第二十一回　婉轉依人過庭憐月貌激昂訓壻隔室聽獅聲　　朱家母女們，把話說到了這要，他們家那一頁慘史，是怎樣的開始，這就很明瞭了。周太太點點頭：這些事，傷心也够傷心的。不過事情已經是過去了，空傷心一陣子，也對你們的事情無補，你們現在還是應當想想，怎麽去和賈先生商量，讓你們可以來往。胡嫂子在一旁就搖着頭道；這是不能開口的，因爲我們把姑娘給賈老爺的時候，已經說妥了的，他敎我們來往就來往。他若不開口敎我們來往，我們是不能去找他的。　太太道：你們就去找他一趟，要什麽緊？難道他　够打你們一頓不成？朱胡氏左手拖了右手的袖頭子，只管去揉揉着眼睛角，撇了嘴道：姑娘給了人家，總指望人家夫妻和和氣氣的，我們若是和賈老爺鬧上脾氣，不是回我們姑娘添上罪嗎？他說着這話，雖是還在揉擦着眼角，然而那兩行眼淚，已經是偸偸的流了下來。周太太雖是個婦人，然而爲了他個性的不同，他是不願意聽人家哭聲的看到這種樣子，便把話剔了開去，因道：賈太太你還是說你以前的事吧？　是願意聽人家說過苦日子的事情的。（三五四）御香縹緲錄  淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯　　「有一件事你可還記得嗎？幾年之前，太后爲着要堅我信心的，並說明伊自己的憂慮决非無謂的憂盧起見，又繼續給我說道：「突然有一天的傍晚，天上起了一層血一般的紅雲，幾乎把京城附近幾百里地方全罩住了，當時大家就覺得很驚慌，後來不是又在夭上發現了一顆彗星嗎？因此人心分外慌亂，到處可以聽到許多謠言。因爲俗語稱彗星爲掃帚星，乃是一個最不祥的星象，再加上又有滿天的紅雲，那是更非好兆了；我們自然也很憂慮，惟恐將有什麽禍患發生。然而任你事事謹愼，政不妄舉，那一年終於敎我們讓日本打了一個大敗仗，喪師失地不算，且又賠了不少的銀子出去；紅雲和彗星的凶兆，畢竟是應騐了。如今這一朶不該開而開的木蘭花，眞不知道又要把我們怎樣作弄咧！」　　伊說的時候眞有萬分誠懇的態度，人祗要見了伊這種態度，便不由他不信了。但迷信最深的還是伊老人家自己。伊從得到了李蓮英的報吿之後，舉止是越發的張皇了，伊簡直不能再在龍椅上安坐着，祇見伊忽而起立，忽而走向窗前去，忽而憮然長嘆，忽而連運頓足，險些連穿戴衣冠，準備上朝的耐性也沒有了；大家又不敢催促，幸而伊還能竭力的自制，終於像每天一樣的穿齊了全副的盛裝。（四五〇）拉雜話「為朋友」  枕綠　　我有一位極相好並相通財的朋友，最近來信說起：「朋友之間無論如何的交好，總不免是賴互利用罷咧！」　　他這句話確是道着了大多數友誼的眞面目！所謂知己，知心，平日間慷慨激昂得像可以替死的朋友，有幾人眞能無條件的帮助朋友呢？　　不過，我的意見是世間决不絕對沒有眞够朋友的朋友！這等人必須逢到特殊的試騐的機會，纔會顯出他的資格給人認識，他是確能不存什麽利用這朋友的念頭，但憑着他自己的良心和血性巷朋友幹，爲朋友犧牲的；在平時，他也無法自見，或自別，只得在普通相互利用的朋友之間相混一起罷了。不過，這等眞朋友不是常得交到，更不是常可見到，無怪衆人要疑爲沒有這種人，這回事了！　　但看，豫讓怎樣的恩報舊主，程嬰和公孫杵臼怎樣的計存孤兒，五百個無名小卒爲什麽跟從田橫自殺，……在那同一朝代裏便有這不少能「爲朋友」的人，他們的朋友當初給交他們時，也許有利用他們之意的，他們報答朋友的時候，該是沒有什麽可給他們利用的了罷？　　原來不想利用着什麼而能「爲朋友」的人，他們或出於眞心賞識這朋友，或者激於私恩，或也有多份動了人類互助的公義，其道不止一端，未可概論，那結果在爲朋友亳無利用却是一樣的。　　所以古人把朋友列爲五倫之一，取其能從情感的出發點發揮「無我」和「盡其在我」的精神。或者說：「爲朋友」的人也許多少有點兒沽名市義的動機——除了互相利用以外。」那麼，至愛如夫婦，至親骨肉如父子兄弟之間的情分，也和行路之人沒有多少區別了！不如說：「這世界原已進爲一個唯利的，無情的世界，」似乎最是透闢快意咧！　　可惜從古到今，假朋友多而眞朋友少，後輩看了前輩的榜樣，迷信着「服從多數，多數總是對的」這個或例，以爲交朋友是理應這樣互相利用的；於是「熱衰則交疎，金盡則交絕，史蹟越長，人間世越難找見眞朋友，眞友誼了！做「絕交論」的人還不是有見及此，寗願趨於偏激一流麽！　　唉！「爲朋友，」誰不先爲自己却肯單爲朋友呢？現代如果有這樣的人，雖未必够稱聖人，至少可算是一位賢者，我願向他三鞠躬咧！平民如何解決療肺問題  沈兆荃醫師　　患者。受肺結核之診斷。其本身及家人。對於如何行最適當之治療。又是否應行轉地療養。抑住入專門醫院。抑卽在自宅療養之。此三種問題。頗難解决。　　結核爲極頑固之慢性病。非短時期卽可全治之症。有時需要數月之繼續療養。故欲解决轉地。入院。自宅療養之前。應先考慮及家庭之經濟狀况。　　照現在之情狀。無論入院。轉地。卽竭力節約。每月仍不免一筆費用。而又須繼續至數月之久。故實爲一重大問題。　　自患者而言。卽使轉地或入院。倘憂慮及其費用者。則又何從而養生。旣受病苦。經過數月後。又須再受經濟之壓迫。實大可不必。　　故欲解决入院。轉地。自宅療養之前。應先考慮一家之經濟問題。須知此病需要長期之療養。應有支持長期之計畫。方爲最賢明之方法。倘不甚富裕之患者。若稍稍更改其居室之構造。使能適合空氣療法而於自宅作長期經濟療養。豈不更爲安逸耶。　　此時有當注意者。在患者初受肺癆之診斷。其本人及其家人。大都未有關於結核之知識。而迷信神佛。或雜投醫藥。往往貽誤病機。致不克救治者、伺堪勝數。　　編者從事結核之治療有年。對此觀念尤深。故發心將其一得。貢之世人。幷訂經濟療肺辦法。爲平民永久義務治療。肺病同胞。去興乎來！手淫遺精乃促成肺癆之先鋒  沈香伯醫師　　靑年情竇初開。色情易動。淫穢之書報。曲曲描摹。艷麗之歌辭。聲盈市塵。耳目之濡染。內外之誘惑。致悮犯手淫者。十居其九。積久而情緒激越。幻想紛乘。睡眠時間之減少。腦力減弱。精髓枯槁。形體削夜。食慾不振。漸進而潮熱夜汗。至是肺癆之初兆。臨診所見。病肺癆之靑年。殆人人犯過手淫。有感於自體之疲勞而卽時覺悟者。或經醫生之忠吿方悔改不敢者。然而元氣　傷。已呈神經衰弱。夢遺。滑精之種種症候。若不早治痊愈。終則實現肺癆之病象。豈不大可懼哉。　　一般攝生及療養法第一不可閱猥褻書籍。戒除手淫。節制房事。第一須修養身心。脫離複雜之生活。遠避煩燥之思慮。避免過勞。第三施行適當之運動。攝取滋養無刺戟性食物。臥床被褥貨輕。淸晨早起。常行冷水摩擦。微溫半身浴及全身浴等。尋常所用藥物。大抵爲强壯劑及鎭靜劑（鐵劑·臭素劑·砒劑·憐劑等）但效力均不甚確實。按著者經騐。神經衰弱與遺精。用內分泌製劑「還爾童』WeltTonic服後可使神經系統之營養良好。而有恢復神經之刺戟性衰弱之效騐。對於夢遺滑精。更有卓效。瘦弱者須兼行肥胖療法。應用「康氏生活素」ConboursSan—Vita—Cell造血肥肌。尤具補腦固精之效能。如與「還爾童」WcllTonic同時併用。能收意想不到之效力。　　凡身體衰弱。有潮熱·盜汗·胸痛·咳嗽·已肺活」PhithWeal亦可。余之經騐。凡患神經衰弱者。均有發生肺癆之虞。如內服「肺活」PlithWeal可得「有癆治癆」——「無癆者增進健康預防肺癆」之益。哮喘病新療法  沈香伯醫師　　哮喘病。俗有氣喘痰喘等名稱。至其原因。雖學說甚多。莫衷一是。大槪起於慢性支氣管炎。心臟病。慢性腎臟炎等病。此外尙有神經性氣喘者。亦甚多耳。哮喘症狀。常係突然發病。患者呼吸困難。發作劇甚時。則不特不能言語。且甚感痛苦。不知者竟慮其將死焉。迨發作停止。則又立復原狀。其發作短則十數分至二三小時。長則延至兩三日者亦有之。然普通祇數小時而已。發作之次數。有每月二三次者。亦有頻發者。又有一年中祇發數次者。　　一般攝生及療法宜居於空氣淸鮮高燥之地。禁飲酒吸煙。注意勿受感胃風寒。安靜身心。食品擇富於滋養而易消化者。治療哮喘尙無完美之藥品。惟有視其病勢而施適當之治療而已。　　近有德國出品之「肺活」PhithWeal一藥。余曾於臨床實騐。治療哮喘多人。效力甚著。凡於呼吸困難發作之際。內服此藥兩食匙。立即緩解。恢復原狀。若欲根治不發。則須連用三月以上。方能收效。此乃余實騐所得。與其他治表不治本之哮喘藥劑。誠不可同日而語也。療肺以增加抵抗力為主  姜冠羣醫師　　治療肺癆之惟一方法。爲增加病人之抵抗力。故抵抗力强者。雖不加治療亦能自愈。至於增加病人抵抗力之方法。可分休息療法。飲食療法。空氣療法。與醫藥療法四種。各有相當功效。不可偏廢。治療肺病愈早愈好。如用四種療法同時進行。則病勢輕微者往往二三月而痊。見效極爲迅速。患肺病者有一通病。即不能耐心治療是也。其實二三月之後。病勢减輕或治愈。仍須嚴守攝生之法。及續服「肺活」PhithWeal等根治藥品。使禮格日加强固。尤須注意者。勿使病部瘢痕破裂。如舉行深呼吸及劇烈運動等。因此等動作。常能使肺病復發也。治療失敗者多爲不耐心之人。偶見病勢减輕。卽對之漠不經心往往使前功盡棄。此點患肺病者務須注意及之。婦女癆瘵與月經不調  何澤銑女醫師　　健全無病之女子。自十二三歲起，至四十八九歲止。每隔二十七八日至三十日。必自子宮粘膜出血。約繼續三日至八日而止。是謂之月經。乃婦人生理之作用也。若由某種原因。失其經常之序。而暗受疾病之變化。則謂之月經不調。亦曰月經異常。於此分其病情。日月經閉止。月經過多。月經困艱三種。凡有經病之婦女。大多身體衰弱。面黃肌瘦。甚則致成癆瘵者。此爲臨床上所常見也。　　治療月經不調之藥品。名目繁多。且多屬收縮子宮之劇藥。服量稍多。每易發生危險。且應用於孕婦。爲害尤大。余服務於虹口產科醫院時。對於婦人月經不調。不論過多過少。或前或後。經來腹痛。以及身體衰弱。神經不安等症。皆用「美奴寗」Menorin治療之。實騐例不下數百餘人。無不得心應手。藥到病除。　　倘已成癆瘵病象者。卽與「肺活」PhithWeal或「康氏生活素」ConboursSan—Vita—Cell等同時服用。奏效尤爲卓絕。「肺活」PHITH　WEAL在現代治療肺癆之價值  沈兆荃醫師　　肺癆之治療。在近代醫學進步下。日新月異的表現出來。如理學療法。藥物療法。免疫療法等等。吾人臨床上。倘因時制宜。均可收相當之效果。各種療法中尤以注射方法功大力速。惟我國一切學術尙在萌芽時代。醫藥常識未能普及。民間療法。重在內服。因風俗及習慣之故。對於注射。尙少信仰。非至病入膏肓。斷不輕允一試也。其間或有信仰此項療法。往往以取價昂貴。幾亦視爲畏途。或有就醫不便。因循坐誤。如此以觀。爲補救吾國現狀計。勢惟覓一妥善之內服藥。方爲得策。　　近有德國醫學博士Gerson發明「肺活」PhithWeal藥。余應用於臨床。治療各期肺癆患者。不下數百餘例。無不得心應手。藥到病除。較之普通療肺藥實高出百倍。茲將其中所含之成分。解釋於左。使讀者及病家得澈底認識。　　第一成分肺臟越幾斯Extract．ofPulmonary　　由哺乳動物新鮮肺臟中。用科學方法抽出的有效成分（肺臟荷爾蒙）。牠的功效。能於肺臟病部呈直接作用。塡補其缺損。調和保持其機能幷同時在病灶之周圍。築成鞏固結締織的牆壁。包裹結核菌。促其死減。且能使進行性的病型。轉爲停止性。吸收結核菌分泌的毒素。而令熱度低降。更有增進血液之凝固力。對於防止咯血的作用。更爲著顯。所以肺臟治療。是最新發明。治療肺結核的神聖軍。　　第二成分　肝臟越幾斯Extract．ofLiver　　用小牛生肝內的造血及解毒荷爾蒙（Hormon）消化素肝臟殿粉蛋白鐵來豈丁Ledihin（A．B．C）三種維他命等。用科學方法提出。他的效用。是促進紅血素之產生。赤血球之形成。爲世界公認之補血的特效劑。尤其是對於結核之貧血症。極有偉效。　　第三成分類脂質（又名卵黃素）Lecithin、　　本品能補充細胞內的類脂質。早經各國醫師公認。用於神經衰弱。貴血。肺癆等症。有極大的滋補力。故用後體力旺盛。則病狀漸减。而臻健康之域矣。　　第四成分睪丸腺荷蘭蒙Extract．ofSpermary　　用少壯動物睪丸腺。以科學方法抽取其中的荷爾蒙（即內分泌物）凡患結核病的人。大都現神經衰弱。及體內新陳代謝之失調。如用本劑。可恢復細胞之活動力。預防未老先衰。挽回日漸消失之生活機能。增加天然抵抗疾病之能力。尤有特殊的功效。　　「肺活」PhithWeal備具上述四種成分外。尙配有化痰止咳以及滋補强壯等等十數種珍責的藥品在內。所以牠主治的病症。是各期肺·肺臟瘍·肺壞疽·急慢性氣管炎·哮喘·百日咳。咯血。腺病瘰　，諸虛百損。神經衰弱。等等。都有特殊的功效。這是根據我臨床實騐的成績舉出。完全是事實。並沒一點虛僞！　　還有虧弱虛損的人。他最先受影響的就是肺經。所以免不了咳嗽痰多常時感冒。到後來見紅吐血。才知道成了肺癆。我們欲預防這種病症。必須强壯身體。增加抵抗力。方能免除傳染之憂患。因此虛弱體質的人。　　服「肺活」PhithWeal最爲適當。可說是：「有癆者治癆」「無癆者增進健康預防肺癆」這是現代防治肺癆最有價値的製劑。可稱爲內服藥中之權威！肺病叢話  沈兆荃醫師　　（一）預防肺病　　（一）勿使心身過勞。須有適當之運動及休息。睡眠須有充分。　　（二）多在戶外之淸凈空氣中生活。室內之窗戶須常開放。使與外氣流動。　　（三）健全胃腸。使全身之榮養狀態良好。如!有胃腸障碍或榮養不良之時。須服用滋補藥劑。如「康氏生活素」Conbour’sSan—Vita—Cell爲最有效。　　（四）每日行冷水摩擦。鍜錄皮膚。豫防感胃。行紀律之生活。避一切之不攝生的。　　（五）若時有短咳。胸部壓感。晨起多痰等此爲肺弱之徵。最易成癆。應行深呼吸。增加營養。避免過勞外。並須常服「肺活」PhithWeal使肺臟强健。　　（六）如患遺精。致有神經衰弱者。乃發生肺病之先兆。須特別注意攝生。並服用「還爾童」PhithWeal使神經系經之榮養良好。有恢復神經之刺戟性衰弱之效騐。　　（七）俯有疑似肺病症狀（如胃呆·削瘦·咳嗽·胸痛等）發見時。即應從速請專科醫師診治。勵行修養。遵守醫師之指導。革新生活。並服用有效之藥劑。（肺活PhithWeal最佳）。　　（二）肺癆吉凶之預測　　肺癆雖云難治。但若療治得法。究非不治之症。故各國醫家有解剖因他病致死之屍體。而發現其肺臟中有曾患肺癆治愈之痕跡。是即肺癆可治之明證。近代醫學進展。非但認肺癆之可治。卽由患者之環境症狀。亦可預測其結果。其預測之法。係按下例諸端而定之。　　（一）患者發熱否。因發熱最易使身體衰躬。故發熱者較不發熱者爲凶。若經治療三四月而仍不退者。是此症已無痊愈之望矣。　　（二）體重低减否。患者若因肺癆减其體重者。則較不减體重者爲凶。　　（三）脈象細弱否。息者之脈象若因肺癆者變細躬。則較脈象平常爲凶。　　（四）咯血否。患者咯血較不咯血爲凶。咯血多者較咯血少者爲凶。　　（三）神經衰弱之肥滿療法　陳一靑醫師　　神經衰弱患者。多限於貧血營瘦之現象·因此則抵抗力薄弱。易而發生肺癆疾病·故宜設法調治之·即於贏瘦衰弱者。施以肥滿療法·此時患者須多量攝取滋養物。力圖身心之安靜。他如新藥中之「康氏生活素」。Conbour’sSan—Vita—Cell對於本症亦甚有效。但貧血為「神經衰弱」之續發性症候。其治療常須與其原病之治療相持，換言之。即應將其神經衰弱症治愈後。貧血方能治愈也。故貧血之治療。宜先用「還爾童」Well　Tonic治愈其神經衰弱。再繼以「康氏生活素」持續內服如此約經一月。貧血殆可愈矣。</p>

<p>（Chlorine　Water）中洗一回手。一盆鹽素水給放在產房門口。二年間，那第一產房中的產婦死亡率從四百五十九降落到四十五。那麽，伊格內茲的發明大槪可以得到熱烈的歡迎吧。恰好相反，當時一般產科敎授們把他的意見看做邪說。他們說：「怎麽？產褥熱是我們做醫生的親手造成的嗎？荒謬的事！不相干的事！」在地們的心目中，分娩是天然危險的事，　產褥熱正是一種無法避免的疾。們把伊格內茲的學說視爲有損於產科醫生的名譽，因此竭力反對他，攻擊他。但伊格內茲仍然努力於宣傳他的學說，發表論文，逢人勸吿。大衆的漠視與個性的熱切，逼迫他發了瘋；這年靑的醫學革命者後來　死在瘋人院中。　　在反對伊格內茲的聲浪中，也有少數醫生贊同　的主張的，凱爾（Kiel）地方的密開立斯敎授（Prolessor　　Nichaelis）便是其中之一。密　立斯曾親手替他的姪女收生，不幸她產禱熱死了。在聽、伊格內茲的發明後，密　斯斷定殺死他的姪女的就是他自己。爲表示他的遺憾與真摯起見，他竟自殺在火車下面。耳鼻喉眼衛生常識  唐仁縉　　（六十九）（續）　　（第四）寄生性口腔炎　　寄生性口腔炎又名鵝口瘡。是由一種鵝口瘡菌傳染而發。這種細菌的一部。是呈絲狀。一部是由類圓形的芽胞而成。牠的傳染徑路。可由空氣的媒介而傳染於口腔。或者寄生於哺乳器而侵入乳兒的口內。本菌在口腔不潔，殘留於口腔內的乳汁分解，乾燥，及發炎的時候。特別可以發育增殖。一般哺乳兒最易發生本病（生後一二週的哺乳兒最多）。其他在成年，則常發於重症傷寒，肺癆，癌腫及糖尿病等體質衰弱的患者。　　鵝口瘡的主要症候。就是在舌，頰，及軟口蓋的粘膜面。發生潮紅，腫脹及白斑，白斑初則細小。繼卽增大。口腔內面。呈作一片白色。如雪。所以俗間特稱本病爲雪口。初期雖得容易剝離。但至後期。則常固著。而呈帶黃色或赤褐色。有時候白斑竟可蔓延及於咽，喉，及食管。唾液的分泌。大都旺盛。乳兒在哺乳的時候。多感不便及疼痛。以致常常啼哭。有時且來下痢，羸瘦等症。成人在咀嚼及咽下的時候。亦多訴疼痛。本病的經過。約爲一星期至二星期。牠的療法。第一必須注重口腔衛生。乳兒在哺乳的前後。宜用百分之二的硼酸水。時時拭清口腔。同時乳母的乳頭及哺乳器。亦須保持淸潔。口腔若已發生白斑。則用制心細菌發育的藥水。塗布或漱口。　　（第五）壞疽性口腔炎　　壞疽性口腔炎又名水癌。爲口腔炎中最凶險的一種。多見於髒質虛弱的小兒。牠的誘因。可以分爲內外二種。所謂外因者，如貧苦，營養不良，及不尙淸潔等等。所謂內因者，若麻疹，猩紅熱，百日咳，痘瘡，間歇熱，肺炎，赤痢，結核，梅毒等傳染病及美吉利病，出血性素質等全身病。臨床上較易遇著的。要推續發於麻疹的爲最多。　　本病主要的症候。卽在頰部的粘膜（口角相近處）。先發水泡。繼生潰瘍。牠的腐敗臭氣。使人撲鼻難聞。由病灶部蔓延於表面及深部。非常迅速。所以不經數日。浸潤卽可達於面頰的外面的於是潰瘍向外部穿破。露出的骨質。旋卽壞死。故本病的外觀。確爲頰壞疽。同時病側的顏向。亦發副行性的浮腫。附近的淋巴腺。亦來腫脹。再者本病每發高熱。常達攝氏四十度左右。體力的消耗亦甚速。患者感覺局部疼痛。唾液的分泌亦旺盛。並混膿血。　　本病的預後。非常不良。凶多吉少。牠的死亡數。約爲四分之三。死亡的原因。或爲突然虛脫。或爲病後衰弱。牠的治療方法。就是用燒灼法或腐蝕法。藉防病變的蔓延。一方注意病人的營養。設法維持他的體力。但是多屬不治而亡。肺結核淺說（七三）  胡嘉言　　第三節　病者之精神修養　　對於食　禁忌一療法，在近來是狠有一部分人主張的；他們以謂體內氯伊洪减少，有結締組織形成力增速之效果的。他們的主張是：限制病者的食鹽，如果發生食慾不佳狀態，可以其他香料或肉汁來代替；肉類亦須加限制，水份須减少，脂肪量可增加，新鮮的菜蔬和水菓也可增加多量的。這一種療法，對於皮膚結核方面的成績最好，對於肺結核方面，也有一部分助力的；但究竟在何種時期或何種型式最宜一層，一直到現在還沒有定論，這祇能有待於後來者之補正了！　　安靜休獲在本症治療上的重要，上面已經講過了：但單獨靠這種肉體安靜，有時候還是不够的，所以病者之精神安靜與否，也治療上一大問題，狠值得鄭重提出的。我們要曉得，肺結核患者的感情，大半是過度銳敏的；儘敢他靜心瞑目，終日仰臥，但是他的精神方面的活動，是不會停止的。關於他本身每日症象的詳情：像咳嗽之有無，體溫之高低，痰中結核菌之有無，食慾之良否，等種種；都朝夕注意，不厭煩瑣的。所以身髒雖安靜，但精神並未安靜，對於病症之前途，當然是有害無利的。如果症象微現變化了，例若溫度較高，食慾欠佳，等情；有時候祇是暫時的得失，和全部並無關係，但病者則中心　鬰，煩悶莫名，以謂症勢已現惡化了！就是翳者竭力安慰，也不能解其心中之鬰結的。結果陷於强度神經衰弱症，病人的自信力和勇氣也喪失了，往往狠可痊愈的病症，結局也弄得不可收拾：眞所謂：「涓涓不壅，終爲江河；」了！　　更正　十月二十一日所刋係第一節「天然治療之末段，並非第二節；而　　十四日所登者，乃第二節之前段，特爲訂正。牙齒常識問答（八）  林鑑賢　　（第四三問）齒髓的功能是什麽？　　（答）有二種功能：（一）製造和營養牙質。若是牙質受損壞，牠會新生一層牙質，以保護自己。謂之第二牙質。（二）富有知覺，能戚應外來冷熱的，或化學的，或機械的激刺　　（第四四問）齒髓怎樣感應外界的激刺？這威應有什麽好處？　　（答）牠感應的表示就是痛。譬如我們吃太冷太熱，或太酸的東西，牙齒就覺酸痛。或是牙齒受車的敲擊，或是蛀洞達到深部，也會覺痛。牙痛的表現，就是傷害到臨的警吿。使得我們可以預早設法制止，免得受害太深，挽救不及　　（第四五問）沒有牙髓的牙齒，和牙髓完好的牙齒有什麽分別？　　（答）牙髓原是活的細胞牙質爲牠營養，也是活的。若是牙髓出了毛病壞死，或被抽去！牙質失却營養，也是死的。這時候牙齒就　爲死的牙齒止痛的醫學（三九）  李興　　迷蒙藥　　科學進步爲醫學的前鋒。十九世紀中各種科學發動如雨後春筍。醫學家也乘時利用科學新知以發揚光大醫學，故醫學之發明也有一日千里之勢。在科學醫史上一頁最光榮的發見是迷蒙藥實用。迷蒙藥之發見也爲外科開闢了一條光明大道。其有造於人類實非淺鮮。這種的發明實在是有記念的價値，其發見之經過也富有趣味。　　西歷一千七百九十九年時有一英人名大維曾發表一養化淡（卽笑氣）之迷蒙性，且曾提議用一養化淡氣迷蒙經外科手術的病人。按一養化淡氣被吸入身內頃刻間吸者就失去知覺，及　醒時大發狂笑故名笑氣。凡稍研究過化學的大槪都知笑氣的這種作用。不過科學家是富於研求性的，大維就想利用這種氣體來迷蒙吸者以消除疼痛。在當時是一種破天荒的提議。因他不是醫生所以沒有得到實用。不過這是蒙藥發見的先聲。一直等到了一千八百四十二年美國喬其州的郎醫生才首次用以脫迷蒙外科病人。　　一八四四年的十二月間美國康乃悌克州的牙醫威爾氏於聽人演講與表演笑氣時，他看到一人吸了笑氣後失落了疼痛知覺。他憑着這種暗示第二日就用笑氣將一位病人迷蒙，後拔去其牙。此人醒後完全不知有痛苦。這是威爾氏之極大成功。笑氣於是就入於實用時期。他也遂卽著書立說大彰自己才能而忘却飲水思源，完全淹沒別人功德。後來論者雖不公認他是發見笑氣的，但也承認他介紹笑氣入於實用的功績。最不幸的是一八四五年在波士頓公開表演結果一部分不見美滿受大衆議評。同時又有摩爾頓氏表演以脫迷蒙結果美滿致笑氣被擯棄多年。威爾氏自從公開表演失敗受譏後　鬰不樂，終成瘋狂，最後自殺。威氏之慘死也要算是爲科學醫學與爲人類幸一福犧牲。由此可見科學之發明並非偶然得來。將年後卽一八六三年柯呑氏（先是威爾氏由柯吞氏表演得到笑氣的功用，藉以彰顯自已淹沒柯氏功績。）又起利用笑氣爲蒙藥卒吿成功。到了一八六八年牙醫界已普遍使用笑氣爲蒙藥。　　波士頓有一位化學家名傑克生在一八四一年自己曾吸過量以脫失去知覺，故提議用以脫爲蒙藥。他自己並未實用不過將這種意見介紹給別人，其中有一位名摩爾頓氏。此人與威爾氏與傑克生均爲朋友，他本人也是牙醫生。先是摩　頓氏得知威爾氏的發見會商於傑克生並研究大量製造笑氣應世，傑克生建意製造以脫以代因輕而易舉。後摩爾頓氏繼續研究以脫終至大吿成功。</p>

<p>申報本埠增刊談言還是救救學生  子南　　前日夢若先生提出一個意見：廢除會考制，我以為是對的。會考。事實上不僅美好處，並且為了應付多種功課起見，不得不走走捷徑，讀一些會考指南或是什麽大綱之類，這事情的結果，便養成貪近就易的習慣，瞧之於近來出版界方面的「指南」「大綱」一類書的踴躍，便是最好的鐵證。　　其實，咱們的教育制度不僅是此一端如此，其他方面也有許多的類比；例如課餘活動吧，也如此。　　課餘活動，大槪是所謂養成做一個良好公民和過慣集團的團體生活起見吧，便有種種「小政府」和其他的小團體的組織，把天眞未鑿的小孩子們硬拉在一起，算作爲訓練未來的國民。　　但其結果如何呢？套一句夢若君的話，「其流弊之大，想爲主倡者始料所不及。」　　主倡者的原意，或許是鑒於學生一出了學校的門便摸不到社會的門，於是在學校裏便先來一個雛形的社會組織，於是，短短的一條走廊，便題上一個××路等而總共祇有三間敎室的弄堂學校，也居然麻雀雖小，五臟俱全的來分起什麽市什麽局來。　　這種官派十足的組織，結果除了養成孩子們做官的觀念之外，旁的便再也得不了什麼，若要說是先讓體騐社會生活吧，事實上吿訴你，祇要你跨出學校的門檻，踏上社會，張目四望一下，管敎你人事全非，知道學校裏的所謂社會生活者，全不是這麼簡單。　　而在學校裏，旣有這麽一個「組織」，跟隨而來的，也就是爭權奪利；記得自己在學校裏唸書的時候，就親身經歷過這樣的生活，當時自己的一級和最高的一級搶縣長做，爲了掠取「羣衆」起見，便四出向低的班子裏活動，作爲活動的甘餌的，是請客，是答應送東西給低級班子的級長，是聯絡運動選手作爲武裝保鏢。　　而除此之外，什麽功課，都視爲次要的。　　所以中學畢業生之大都學文科，法科，政治經濟者，就因爲這是近於「仕</p>

<p>途」的緣故。　　「救救孩子」！「救救學生」吧！轉着的輪子  孟華　　輪子不斷的轉着，發出了一陣陣有節奏的吱吱的聲音。　　李四嫂子蹲在輪旁，一隻手按住那個土胚，一隻手用竹板小心地磨着，修着。她從早上作到現在，眼睛已給弄昏花了。在她眼睛下面的輪子，亦好像越轉越大，就好像一朶烏雲一般，低低地罩着這座大工房，把四周都弄得漆黑了。　　輪子不斷的轉着，日子亦像轉着的輪子一般呵。李四嫂子心頭就逗起了那些往事來了。　　「坐在黃蓮樹下過着的日子呵」！她想着。她的手從來就沒有停過。小孩子時候，別人家的孩子還是在玩的時候，她就帮着媽作活計了。許多人都在她媽面上誇獎着她：　　「看小桃才十來歲，正是玩的時候，就能給她媽賺錢了！」　　「是孩子苦命哩。」她媽說着，有時候還撲範範地滴下眼淚來。那時候，她手里的針就穿得越勤些。她把小小的手弄成棒槌一般，夜里有時候亦哭着，可是她媽就疼着她。　　後來，媽死了。她亦大了。時常嘔氣的爸爸老是打着她，有一天，她就給一個不相識的男人接去了。　　輪子還是轉着，李四嫂子站起來，用脚使勁抹它一下，輪子就又拚命的轉着，一面吱吱的嚮。　　李四嫂子又想着：以後人家不再叫她小桃了，呌她李四嫂子。李四是一個好人，他成天在田裏幹活。她亦就帮着他。她的手從來就沒有閒過一天的。不久，她就是小順子的母親了。他們三個人不幸福亦不痛苦的活着。小順子亦正是在玩的時候，就在田裏拔草，戽水，車水，還要送飯給她爸爸。人家亦誇獎小順子，說她小小年紀亦能够跟大人一樣幹活。她媽雖然疼她，但還是不讓她偷空去玩哩。　　輪子還是轉着，李四嫂子的眼睛覺得更加昏花起來了。　　她同她男人逃荒了。因為是荒年，稻子還沒有抽穗就給熟毒的太陽曬死了。他們討飯，他們作短工，幫人幹活，差一點還把孩子買了。再過一年，看看快要打稻的時候，就漲水了，水淹漫了莊稼，水衝壞了她的家，把難狗豬牛都活活給淹死了。這樣，她又跟她男人逃荒到遠遠的大城去。他們沒有親人，亦找不到飯吃。於是她男人就作工去了，她，女孩在馬路上替人作活計，補襪子，補短褲，補大褂，還是一個十二歲的小女孩子哩。她自己呢？就在這瓷器廠裏當一名女士，從早上到晚上不停地修，不停地削，不停地磨，看看亦將近一年了。　　「坐在黃蓮樹下過着的日子呵」！她心裏想着，她也一雙手從出娘胎就沒有一個時候停過一嚮呵。　　輪子不斷的轉着，發出吱吱的聲音。日子亦跟旋轉着的輪子一般，過着那麼快呵。　　李四嫂子的眼睛更加昏花了。她幾乎連轉動着的輪子亦看不清。可是她的手却本能地，下意識地磨着，修着。頭亦疼得昏得難受。　　天色漸漸暗了。電燈一亮。他抖擻地站起身來。「又過了一日了。小順子今天作活不曉得又給人奚落了沒有？這日子，難挨呵，這日子！」李四嫂子想着，走出了廠門。　　日子跟旋動着的輪子一般，過的那麼快呵。　　小順子蹲在輪邊，用竹板小心地磨着，修着那土胚。她的眼亦給弄花了。人家說小順子能幹，十三歲就進廠作工賺錢了。可是小順子聽了把淚珠兒往肚里吞，心想「不作工麼？那就得吃煤渣哩！」　　她看看輪子就記起她媽來。「媽媽就是給這些苦死了的，現在，就輪了我來補媽的缺了。什麼時候才苦個够呵？」　　輪子不停地轉着，發出一陣陣有節奏的，吱吱的聲音。　　日子亦跟旋轉的輪子一般，過的那麼快呵。　　「轉！轉！轉！儘量地轉吧！」小順地低低地說。統病房  凌秄錫　　療養院的末等病房，連自己一共緊緊擁擠了八個人。而八個人全得把病的氣息吐在這小小的，祗有二扇窗門的房間里，想着，這是十分可怕的，十分不舒服的啊。　　剛吃過午餐，離規定的午餐時間還早，天是從早上起就沒出過太陽，老是那麼一付陰慘慘的神色，而且，刮了風，又下起雨來了；有幾個病人昨晚上就沒有好睡，轉側地喝了一整夜；早上好聲地央看護密絲去請醫生來診一診，醫生帶着滿不高興的神氣來了。給幾個人人呼叱起來了：「自己不知道養，還要生什麼事，儘是診啊診的！上個禮拜不是已診過了嗎？要天天診就住頭等病房去！你們這些……！」　　病人們像犯人那樣地噤住了口，一種畏懼的心情通過了全身，戰抖而担心；天啊，但願不要是「你們這些賤種」！　　「末等病房里的人，真是註定了的賤種啊，」一個人，連連地咳嗽，等醫生和看護小姐走了出去之後，那麼感傷地獨個兒嘰咕着。　　沒有人接他底嘴，他嘆了一口氣，緩緩地說起來了：「啥世道唔！這時代，窮人生了富貴病，就只有死的份兒囉，要不是我妻兒還年輕的，我是不願意來療養的啦。」　　「我也是的哪，」靠窗的一個老病人，啞着嗓子，抖抖地接了他底話頭：「做了大半世的苦人，也够了。做出了一身病還不算，為了一家的生活，得借了債來療養，可是三個五個月出去，却依舊得去做苦工，依舊得去……」　　人一過五十歲，在感傷中添上殘暴的成分了。　　聽着這話，幾個人呆着，看颯颯地打在窗上的雨點。　　「唉，」一聲長長的嘆息，從屋角裏的病榻上飄了起來：「說生活吧，我自己，像蝸牛爬山那樣的，又峻險，又費力，然而也三十幾年地爬過來了。可誰又想到在苦工中會得了這種病呢。人家都說，這是富貴病呀。像我們那樣，七八個人擠在一小間裏，不照紫光，不進貴重的補品，不施用人工氣胸－造福人類的發明與我們是無緣的阿！每天吃幾碗粥飯，量一量熱，受醫生與看護的氣，聽別人底呻吟……，你想，這有點什麼用處呢？還不是在挨死日嗎？我常常在想：過這種日子，還看什麼病呢？」　　「不錯呀，在這個時候，窮人生病，根本就是一種犯罪呀！我們怎麼還會有醫治的權利呢？……」　　走廊裏，急燥的腳步一聲聲地飄着，講話的聲音三聲兩聲地飄進來：房裏的人則心頭都是冷冷的，像外面的濕了的土地一樣，雨不斷地在敲打……　　氣候陰沉而寒冷，風從窗子里吹進來。人打着寒噤。已經是十足的初冬的情調了。我們一羣，帶着一堆病的身體與心情，在想着這病的世界。仿佛一切都與我們自己一樣的糟，得來一次徹底的X光檢視，與熱烈的紫光治療呢。　　門外咯咯地響着脚步聲，看護小姐又推門進來，往四週看一看，接着就用命令的聲氣說起來了：「安靜點！不要多煩　病人那裏能儘着多講話呢！是午睡的時候了，大家得好好的睡！」她走來給每個人拉了拉被褥，便重又走了出去，碰的把門關上—留在門裏邊的我們，都一聲不響地靜下來了。　　我夜沉沉地睡去，但是外面依然下着擾人的冰冷的細雨。冷落的村子  小綺　　溫暖的陽光永遠是那麼柔和地照射着大地，原野間的樹林永遠是嬝着各種姿態搖曳於浸透了清新之意的徵拂的曉風中，樹陰里照常躱着不知名的小鳥在婉囀地歌唱着。可是在陽光射照下的一些活躍人们的動態却漸漸地蕭條了。　　莊稼人是應該終年像一頭畜生的磨碌着，而亦每個人都願意忙個手脚沒暇停一停，犁田夕播種，戽水，割秧，在那些田地里，在那些種子里，他們是曉得會由自己的汗，氣力漑灌出來的一穗穗的碩大的粟子，再變成一隻隻的耀眼的金子的。他們永遠用着愉快的心熱望這時節的到來。於是做活越火熾，日子也過得挺有勁，誰也沒有空間去憂慮什麼，或掛懷什麼，可是如今怎樣呢，大家都閒的發慌，粗大的胳胳沒地方使用，只有用來跟女人冒火的時候掼打女人，許多田園都讓荒廢，叫草株做了家了。走得了全走空，走不動衹好半挨餓地守着凄涼的日子。　　前頭那種美滿的情景已經是夢里世界了。　　在原野上，從沒有路走出一條路來的草徑，因為很久沒人經過，又讓茸茸的野生的大草叢掩覆着，依然找不出路徑了。也不見成羣的牧童的影子，騎着牛背上，一邊走，一邊張着高亢的嗓子跟着樹陰里的小鳥唱和。赤着胳膊，荷鋤的農家，在偌大的田園之上，衹見疏疏落落的幾個人的影子，在從前每一區小小的田地，隨便就是三五人，有的推着剷子翻土，有的浸着腿子在水里，拔雜草，　勤地作息着，臉上掛着健康的笑，嘴上嚕囌着。　　淺塘邊還有洗衣服的娘兒們熱鬧的愉快的說話聲音，和稚氣的宏大的笑。　　那些健康的笑，愉快的說話聲，消失到什麼地方去呢。大清早上，寥寂地，原野上沒有了熙攘的人羣，沒有了結隊成伴的牧童，惟有小鳥兒在落漠地歌吟。而從原野走向村落，同樣地，在大街上，已看不見擁擠的挑擔子的人，尤其是早上冷清清走着幾個無事的閒人，一望不盡的毘隣着的屋子，屋脊上雖然有炊烟飄起，但遠遠的，幾乎隔上十家屋子才瞧見一縷黑烟在霧落地飛散。每家屋子的門前，那麼半天沒有人走出來，有的甚至上了鎖，門鐶都長起銹來了。這里的人們，好像一天一天在稀少下去，似乎無可能再叫他們留戀，都一陣陣四散地各自往別地方走去。從田野走到城市，於是村莊漸漸荒蕪了。播音</p>

<h3 id="e1">Announcement from the Ministry of Finance: Starting Today, Notes from the Three Banks are Designated as Legal Tender; The Entire Nation Should Understand and Adhere to This, and Those Who Spread Rumors, Cause Trouble, or Speculate to Raise Prices Will Be Severely Punished <a href="#e1" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c1" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">1</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Finance announced: Since the recent global economic panic, major countries have successively reformed their monetary policies, prohibiting the circulation of hard currency. Since the price of silver has fluctuated drastically, our country, which uses silver as currency, has been greatly affected. The phenomenon of domestic currency contraction has become extremely apparent, leading to industrial and commercial depression, the decline of all industries, and the outflow of funds, which is greatly detrimental to the international balance of payments. The national economy is declining day by day, and all kinds of adverse conditions are arising together. From July to mid-October of last year, in a period of three and a half months, the outflow of silver reached more than 200 million yuan. If effective measures had not been taken at that time, the country's existing silver reserves would have been in danger of being completely drained. This is something that all Chinese people have clearly seen. Therefore, this Ministry implemented the collection of silver export tax and the balancing tax on October 15 of last year, in order to curb the open outflow of resources and preserve the country's economic lifeline. The emergency crisis could be saved. Although the effectiveness has been evident for a time, it is not a fundamental solution after all. Over the past year, various sectors have repeatedly submitted proposals, requesting the government to find ways to save the situation. Recently, domestic currency has become even more contracted, people are panicked, and the market is even more depressed. If this continues, the economic collapse will be unimaginable. In order to work hard to save ourselves and revive the economy, we must preserve the reserve fund on which the country's lifeline depends, in order to seek the permanent stability of currency and finance. Now, with reference to the precedents of various countries in recent times, the following measures are stipulated and will be implemented immediately:</p>
<p>1. From November 4 of this year, the banknotes issued by the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are designated as legal tender. All receipts and payments of grain taxes and all public and private funds shall be limited to legal tender. The use of cash is not allowed, and violators will have their entire amount confiscated in order to prevent the theft and leakage of silver. Those who deliberately conceal or hide silver with the intention of theft and leakage shall be punished in accordance with the Emergency Punishment Law for Endangering the Republic of China.</p>
<p>2. Banknotes issued by banks other than the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications that have been approved by the Ministry of Finance and are currently in circulation shall be allowed to continue to be used as usual. The amount of issuance shall be limited to the total amount in circulation as of November 3 and shall not be increased. The Ministry of Finance will determine a time limit for gradually exchanging them for Central Bank banknotes, and the statutory reserve fund for the total amount in circulation, together with the newly printed banknotes that have not yet been issued and the old banknotes that have been issued and recovered, shall be handed over to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee for safekeeping. The new banknotes that are being printed shall also be handed over for safekeeping as soon as they are printed.</p>
<p>3. The safekeeping of the legal tender reserve and the issuance and exchange matters shall be handled by the Issuance Reserve Management Committee in order to ensure accuracy and solidify credit. The charter of the committee will be announced separately.</p>
<p>4. All silver firms, shops, and other public and private institutions or individuals who hold silver standard coins or other silver coins, raw silver, and other silver types shall, from November 4, hand them over to the Issuance Reserve Management Committee or its designated banks for exchange for legal tender. In addition to silver standard coins, which will be exchanged for legal tender at face value, the remaining silver types will be exchanged according to the actual amount of pure silver they contain.</p>
<p>5. Existing contracts denominated in silver coin units shall be settled and paid in legal tender at the original amount on the due date.</p>
<p>6. In order to stabilize the exchange rate of legal tender at the current price, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications shall buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction. The above measures are essential for reviving the economy and are not intended to use finance as a purpose. The organization of the Central Bank will also be improved to fulfill the duties of a bank of banks. The general banking system must be reformed and sound, and its liquidity must be increased under stable conditions so that after its funds are sufficient, it can supply the needs of legitimate industrial and commercial enterprises. Real estate mortgage banks will be added, and real estate mortgage laws and regulations will be revised in order to revitalize real estate. The Ministry is currently making concrete plans and will submit them for approval and implementation in due course.

<h3 id="e2">Finance Minister Kong's Declaration on China's Monetary Policy: Emergency Decrees Issued with Reference to Precedents in Various Countries to Consolidate the Currency System and Improve Finance <a href="#e2" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c2" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">2</a></h3>
<p>Kong Xiangxi, Acting President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance, issued the following declaration yesterday on China's monetary policy: Since the major countries have successively abandoned the gold standard and the world's silver prices have soared, the value of China's currency has been excessively raised, and the phenomenon of domestic currency contraction has become extremely apparent, while unemployment has increased, bankruptcies have occurred frequently, capital has flowed out, the national treasury's income has fallen short, and the international balance of payments has been unfavorable. Various conditions have arisen together. Since July of last year, in a period of only three and a half months, the outflow of domestic cash silver has been more than 200 million yuan. If the government had not quickly taken effective measures at that time, the country's existing cash silver reserves would have been in danger of being completely drained. This is something that all Chinese people have clearly seen. Fortunately, the government issued an order on October 15 of the same year to levy silver export tax and balancing tax in order to curb the rise in foreign exchange rates and the open outflow of silver, so that the emergency crisis could be avoided.</p>
<p>However, the effect of this measure is only limited to a temporary period. If the value of currency remains high, currency contraction will continue to exist and become increasingly severe. If the currency value falls, and the difference between the world silver price and the foreign exchange price in our country continues to increase, as has been demonstrated by recent facts, then the large-scale smuggling of silver out of the country will be an inevitable result. In order to preserve the national reserve and to consolidate the currency system and improve finance, the government has issued emergency decrees with reference to the precedents of various countries in recent years, which will take effect from the 4th of this month. The content is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The banknotes issued by the Central Bank, the Bank of Communications, and the Bank of China will be designated as legal tender from the date of promulgation, and their issuance will be centralized. The banknotes issued by other banks will still be allowed to circulate, but they should be gradually withdrawn and replaced with Central Bank banknotes. In the future, the other banks shall not continue to issue new banknotes, and all new banknotes that have been printed but not yet issued shall be deposited in the Central Bank.</p>
<p>(2) All debts denominated in silver coin units shall be repaid in legal tender at face value on the due date.</p>
<p>(3) All holders of silver shall immediately deposit it with the government and exchange it for legal tender at face value.</p>
<p>(4) In order to stabilize the exchange rate of the national currency at the current price, the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications shall immediately buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction. The current state-owned Central Bank will be reorganized into a Central Reserve Bank in the future, and its principal capital shall be supplied by the banks and the public, so that it can become a transcendent agency and fully maintain the stability of the national currency. The Central Reserve Bank shall</p>
<h2>Page 4</h2>
<p>safeguard the reserves of the various banks, manage the national treasury, and collect all public fees, and provide the banks with re-discounting facilities. The Central Reserve Bank does not engage in the business of ordinary commercial banks, but it enjoys the exclusive right of issuance after two years.</p>
<p>The government is also preparing steps to increase the activity capacity of our country's commercial banking system under sound conditions, so that after its funds are sufficient, it can supply the needs of legitimate industrial and commercial gold industries. Among these steps, it is also planned to establish a special agency to handle real estate mortgage business, and to amend the provisions of current laws to make mortgage pledges more</p>
<p>The government is determined to avoid currency inflation. Measures for financial reorganization have been prepared, and after another eighteen months, the national budget can be balanced. Illegal speculation and excessive price increases will be strictly curbed.</p>
<p>The government will implement the above-mentioned active plans for improving the financial and economic situation, in order to achieve results. It is deeply believed that the people of the whole country will not hesitate to support these measures with one heart and one mind, so that the national economy can be restored as soon as possible, and the whole country can reach a state of prosperity. It is stable.</p>

<h3 id="e4">Unified Issuance and Centralized Reserves: Minister Kong Delivers a Speech, Neither Currency Inflation nor Paper Money Policy <a href="#e4" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c4" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">4</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, Kong Xiangxi, Acting President of the Executive Yuan and concurrently Minister of Finance, met with reporters from the Central News Agency last night and delivered a speech as follows: This time, I attended the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang Central Executive Committee in Nanjing. When U.S. Vice President Garner and the U.S. delegation to the Philippines passed through Shanghai to participate in the celebration, I made an appointment for a tea party to meet and talk. I returned to Shanghai to preside over it. Last night, I immediately rushed back to Nanjing, but after returning to Shanghai, I witnessed the chaotic situation in the market. According to interviews with Chinese and Westerners, if our government does not take fundamental measures, the country's finance and social economy will be on the verge of bankruptcy. I have been entrusted by the Party and the country to serve as Minister of Finance. Since last year, I have repeatedly received proposals from various sectors requesting the government to find ways to save the outflow of silver. People from friendly countries have repeatedly made suggestions, especially the views of financial and economic celebrities in neighboring countries, which are in line with the current needs of our country. After careful consultation and repeated consideration, I announced the unified issuance and centralized reserve measures. The fact that this kind of strategy has been practiced by civilized countries for many years, with precedents in place, is neither currency inflation nor a paper money policy. The resolute implementation this time is actually a good strategy for responding to international trends externally and understanding domestic realities internally, and for striving for self-preservation. As for the plan to improve finance and the economy, it is detailed in the declaration that I have issued. I hope that all compatriots in the country, from top to bottom, will unite as one and work together to help the country, so as to lead the country to strength, plan the revival of the economy, and benefit the country and the people. This is urgent.</p>

<p>(Washington) It was learned today that the U.S. monetary authorities, because of the recent decline in the Shanghai currency, have once again actively studied the Chinese currency system issue. Britain recently suggested that international loans be used to stabilize China's financial situation. It is believed here that this is a well-intentioned expression, but whether this agreement can be permanently effective is questionable. Senior officials here are particularly concerned about the impact of the recent North China issue on finance. However, private individuals feel that China may soon try to stabilize its currency after lowering its price. According to reliable sources, the United States still maintains its traditional friendly attitude toward China and will do its best to assist China's financial progress. However, because of the demands of domestic silver leaders and the complexity of the Far East political situation, it has been unable to do what it wants. (National Telegram on the 2nd)</p>

<h3 id="e11">The Ministry of Finance Issues Emergency Decree <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Proclamation</p>
<p>To alleviate the current economic crisis in our country, the Ministry of Finance, referencing precedents from various nations, has issued an emergency decree. Effective today, banknotes issued by the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications are designated as legal tender. All payments for grain taxes and all public and private debts must be settled using legal tender. The use of cash is prohibited, and violations will result in full confiscation to prevent the smuggling of silver. Furthermore, a Legal Tender Reserve Management Committee is established to manage the custody and issuance of legal tender reserves. This measure represents an unprecedented major reform in our country's currency system. The entire nation, whether in urban or rural areas, will be deeply affected by this reform. It is truly the most significant measure since the establishment of the National Government.</p>
<p>Our country has long been in a semi-colonial state, with the national economy suffering greatly from the oppression of imperialist powers. Not only has it been unable to develop, but it has also been declining daily. The global economic panic in recent years has forced major countries to abandon the gold standard one after another. As a result, the price of silver in the world has soared, and the value of our currency has risen accordingly, leading to deflation. Business bankruptcies have emerged repeatedly, capital is flowing out daily, and the balance of international payments is unfavorable. Although the government ordered the imposition of silver export tax and equalization tax on October 15th of last year, silver is still escaping due to the consistently high value of the currency. Now, the Ministry of Finance is resolutely implementing this long-considered monetary policy, aiming solely to prevent the complete outflow of silver reserves.</p>
<p>However, the critical issue of silver outflow lies in the decline of domestic industries and the dumping of foreign goods. While the government's current monetary policy can promote the development of national industries and achieve short-term effects, the fundamental solution lies in protecting domestic industries and preventing them from being further devastated by foreign forces.</p>
<p>Moreover, the direct impact of the government's policy implementation will be a sharp rise in prices. Low-wage workers in various industries may struggle to maintain their livelihoods. The government should be able to make appropriate arrangements regarding this matter of social stability. As for speculative merchants who seize the opportunity to compete for foreign exchange, as can be seen from the recent surge in the gold standard market, this is also expected. If so, the harm will be immeasurable. Fortunately, the Ministry of Finance has ordered the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications to buy and sell foreign exchange as much as possible to stabilize gold prices. The gold standard market can now avoid manipulation by speculators.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Turkey, Iran (Persia), and Iraq had previously entered into a non-aggression treaty and formed a political group. According to a telegram from somewhere on the 2nd, the Iranian Foreign Minister went to Afghanistan on the 31st to discuss with the Afghan government authorities and persuade them to join the group. This is clearly the behind-the-scenes work of Britain and Russia, who want to maintain the status quo in the Near East. Their ultimate goal is to allow Britain and Russia to have no worries in the Near East and prepare to devote full attention to the Far East. Therefore, the Japanese authorities attach great importance to this matter. (3rd, Dentsu)</p>

<p>(Moscow) A message from Boli states that on the 26th of last month, six Koreans armed and intruded into Soviet territory. Northeast of Burtavka Station, they encountered a Soviet border patrol. The patrol immediately attempted to detain them, but the Korean bandits opened fire to resist arrest. As a result of the shootout, two Koreans were killed and two were injured. The remaining two disappeared during the conflict. Later, they encountered another Soviet patrol. The two opened fire on them. The patrol returned fire, seriously wounding one and allowing the other to escape. Subsequently, a large number of reactionary documents, two Browning pistols, two Mauser rifles, two pairs of pliers (used to remove iron rail spirals), and a grappling hook (to remove nails between rails and sleepers) were found at the scene. These items and the direction of the bandits' movements indicate that they intended to destroy the railway from Vladivostok to Grodekovo. This point was confirmed by the captured and injured bandits. They confessed that they were sent to Soviet territory by a certain military organization stationed at San Chako, and that after the first batch returned to Manchuria, the military organization would send a second batch of about seven or eight people to sneak into Soviet territory.

<h3 id="e15">At Dawn Yesterday, Italian Forces Launched General Offensive, Initiated Simultaneously on Northern and Southern Routes, Large-Scale Battle Plan, Abyssinian Forces Ordered to Defend Gorrahei Town to the Death <a href="#e15" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c15" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">15</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) The government has just issued a communiqué stating, "Our army began its offensive on all fronts at 6 a.m. The northern route is advancing towards Magale, while the southern route, the Somaliland troops, continue to operate in the Ogaden region. At the same time, the air force is also actively engaged in reconnaissance." (3rd, Havas)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is reported that the Italian forces on the northern route in Abyssinia have begun to attack Magale. The final order issued yesterday by High Commissioner de Bono is the largest-scale battle plan since the outbreak of the Abyssinian war. This offensive is being undertaken jointly by the native soldiers commanded by General Biccheri Bellori and the troops of General Santini. The subordinates of the surrendered general Gugsa have joined the column commanded by General Santini and are accompanying the operation. Although the main force is departing from Adigrat, the garrison in Aduwa is also participating in the operation to assist in the offensive. (3rd, Havas)</p>
<p>Asmara If the Italian forces can occupy Magale, they will be able to advance and capture the highway connecting Tigray Province and Aksum, so Magale's position is crucial. This highway, which is 250 miles long, was built by the Abyssinian Emperor, and the Emperor may even be overthrown because of it. (20th, Guomin)</p>
<h3 id="e16">Vanguard of Italian Three Corps Advances <a href="#e16" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c16" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">16</a></h3>
<p>(Rome) According to a telegram from Asmara, the First Corps commanded by General Santini and the Ethiopian troops commanded by General Biroli are now advancing to attack Magale. Among them are a battalion of Blackshirts, Ascari soldiers, artillery, reserve troops, and 1,600 troops of Chief Kufsa, who surrendered to the Italian army. However, it was not mentioned whether the Second Corps of Aduwa would participate in this battle. Currently, a total of three corps have been ordered to launch a general offensive, with Magale as their main objective. Although the vanguard of the three corps advanced forward in the middle of this week, the main force is still very far from Magale. General Rudini's troops, who are attacking on the left flank from Adigrat, have reached the Meui Chi well, ten miles away. The Ethiopian troops attacking in the central road have advanced to the town of Hochien in the Ogaden region, which is very important from a political and military point of view. The Second Corps attacking on the right flank has sent an advance team from Aduwa along the commercial road to Magale, and it is now believed to have reached the Uli River. It is not yet known whether the main force on the right flank has returned. It is believed that General de Bono, commander-in-chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, is now planning a major offensive within days, with a line of defense starting from the Danakil Desert on the left, along the Chiwar River south of Magale, and then along the Takaze River to a point where the river forms the Eritrean border line. If this line of defense is occupied by the Italian forces, Magale will be included within it and will have penetrated deep into Abyssinian territory. It is estimated that it will take about two months to repair and consolidate it. It is now believed that General Graziani's large army on the southern route will advance from the desert of Walwal Dagega, with three detachments advancing along the Fanfan River from the Baihi Beri River Juba River to protect its left flank. The right flank is shielded by British Somaliland. General Graziani is likely aiming to encircle Gorrahei from two sides. The area is heavily fortified, and the defending forces have been ordered by the Abyssinian Emperor to defend the enemy to the death, so it will be difficult to take it. Also, it is reported that the Italian forces attacking from Assabai are still in the Musa Ali Mountain area and do not seem to have moved forward. (3rd, Reuters)</p>

<p>Tigray Province Front Our correspondent with the army, Barr, reports that the first target of the Italian offensive is Hochien Town (60 kilometers southeast of Aduwa). General Santini's troops, who are in charge of the offensive, are advancing towards Hochien Town from the Maiwech outpost. There are also several columns of Italian troops and several teams of Ethiopian soldiers passing through the Donakil Desert, who will continue to advance after joining forces with General Santini's troops in Hochien Town. Hochien Town is a must-pass for camel caravans and is extremely important militarily. It is also the only route for advancing to the south. When the Italian forces attack, they must climb a plateau 2,000 meters above sea level. In addition to the aforementioned troops in charge of the offensive, the troops of General Maravigna stationed in Aduwa will also begin to move. At the same time, General Graziani, commander-in-chief of the southern route, will intensify the pressure on the Somaliland front. (3rd, Havas)</p>
<h3 id="e18">Using Natives as Guides <a href="#e18" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c18" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">18</a></h3>
<p>Tigray Province Front In addition to the original troops, the Italian army on the northern route now has a division of native soldiers, commanded by General Mariotti, which will also join the battle and attack the Abyssinian positions. This division is reorganized from the natives of the Donakil region. They have all joined the Italian army as individuals and have been incorporated into the Eritrean native ranks. The reason why they surrendered to the Italian army is that the Donakil region has recently been attacked by the main force of the Abyssinian army, which has caused them to join the Italian army in anger. When they met with the Italian military authorities, most of them held bows and arrows. The Italian army then made them change into military caps and uniforms and gave them rifles. Because the division is already accustomed to the harsh climate of the Donakil region, it is expected to be very helpful in covering the left flank of the Italian army in this operation.

<p>Italian Forces on the Eastern Route Penetrate Deeply Besieged by Abyssinian Tribes Trapped in the Desert and Can Only Await Death</p>
<p>Aksum Our special correspondent, Aochina, reports that according to the Abyssinian government's announcement, after the Italian forces on the eastern route penetrated deep into the Musa Ali Mountains, the Semara tribe in that area surrounded them heavily and are still besieging them. The Italian army has suffered heavy losses and has been forced to enter the Adal Desert, where the climate is harsh and long-term residence can be fatal. However, Italian aircraft still often scout in the Musa Ali area to search for the traces of the Abyssinian tribes. In addition, the correspondents of Italian newspapers stationed in the Abyssinian city of Jugra have said that the Italian army's attitude was very peaceful when it occupied the city. The Abyssinian government has protested against this statement, saying that the Italian army used bombs at the time and used terrorist tactics to deal with the civilians of the city. (2nd, Havas)</p>

<p>Aksum According to a telegram from our special correspondent, Aochina, General Marconi, the governor of Ilubador Province in the easternmost part of Abyssinia, led his troops of 20,000 men to Aksum on foot, which took about a month to arrive. General Marconi once served as the Abyssinian ambassador to Italy and is an outstanding figure among the Abyssinian officials. All European expatriates in Abyssinia know him. This time, he led his troops to Aksum to defend the Emperor. His troops paraded through the streets in formation, and their discipline was very good. Most of the rifles they carried were "Grass-type" rifles purchased by the former Emperor Menelik 30 years ago. Although they are old, they are still very famous in the eyes of the Abyssinian natives because the victory of the Battle of Aduwa against the Italian army in 1896 was achieved with this type of rifle. In addition to a portion of the troops led by General Marconi carrying the aforementioned old rifles, the rest are equipped with new weapons and many machine guns. ((2nd, Havas)</p>

<h3 id="e24">Abyssinian Government Sends Note to the League of Nations Appealing for Financial Assistance Citing the 1930 Convention to Protect Peace and Resist Aggression <a href="#e24" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c24" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">24</a></h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Abyssinian government has sent a note to the League of Nations, requesting financial assistance to protect Abyssinia's peaceful existence and resist a country whose attitude endangers world peace. The note was published here tonight, stating that the League of Nations endorsed the draft convention on financial assistance in times of war or threat of war in 1930. When the Italian aggression occurred, Abyssinia had no army, let alone war materials. The Abyssinian government relied on the guarantee of collective security contained in the League of Nations Charter. It had neither established arms factories nor ammunition factories. The lifting of the ban on arms exports to Abyssinia by the League of Nations after Italy's aggression was of little help. Therefore, Abyssinia is appealing to the League of Nations for financial assistance to protect its peaceful existence. (3rd, Reuters)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to the 11th League of Nations General Assembly on October 2, 1930, in accordance with Article 16 of the League of Nations Charter and the Finnish proposal passed in 1927, it was stipulated that financial assistance would be provided to the aggressed country. The signatories to this case included: Britain, France, Austria, Abyssinia, Spain, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, the Netherlands, Finland, Poland, and other 28 countries. The Abyssinian request this time is based on this case. (2nd, Havas)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The Sanctions Coordination Committee met at 4:15 p.m. First, French Prime Minister and Foreign Minister Laval delivered a speech, saying, "France fulfills the League of Nations Charter with sincerity. France will comply with all programs jointly decided by the governments of all countries. On this day when we are taking important decisions, I would like to tell you that we still have another obligation indicated by the spirit of the League of Nations Charter, which must be fulfilled. In other words, we must find a way to resolve disputes in a friendly manner as soon as possible. Regarding this point, the British and French governments have agreed to cooperate. As far as France is concerned, it has a more urgent obligation than other countries because it signed a friendly agreement with Italy on January 7. Therefore, I will seek all the elements with unyielding perseverance to provide a basis for the negotiations. This is why I initiated diplomatic talks to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. However, I never want to make this talk have a definite nature outside the scope of the League of Nations because any suggestion or decision should be studied or adopted within the scope of the League of Nations. Today, people all over the world expect a lot from the League of Nations. I firmly believe that the League of Nations will fulfill its highest mission of peace and live up to the expectations of the public."</p>
<p>British Foreign Secretary Hoare then delivered a speech, saying, "We have no choice but to take collective action against Italy, which is regrettable. However, in order to be determined to maintain the principles of the League of Nations Charter and the collective security system, there is no other way but collective action. The purpose of our action is nothing more than to shorten the war. We also very much hope that it will succeed. However, in any case, we must continue to seek peace in an honorable way that can be accepted by all parties concerned. The speech recently delivered by French Prime Minister Laval fully represents the common view of all countries. I fully agree with it after listening to it. On the one hand, we are loyal member states of the League of Nations and have the strict duty to fulfill the obligations stipulated in the League of Nations Charter. On the other hand, we also have the same strict obligation, that is, to quickly obtain an honorable resolution of the dispute." Hoare then stated the situation of the recent diplomatic talks between Britain, France, and Italy, saying, "We all have the duty to review all possibilities for maintaining peace. We have done so in the past, and we will do so in the future. So far, the situation of the talks is only an exchange of preliminary opinions, and no specific results have been obtained. If these opinions can obtain specific results, then we will submit them to the League of Nations Executive Yuan for review as soon as possible in the most appropriate way. What we urgently desire is to establish a compromise under the auspices of the League of Nations. The Italian-Abyssinian dispute involves the League of Nations and the three parties of Italy and Abyssinia. We have not forgotten it. It would be a great injustice to say that we intend to establish an agreement that cannot be accepted by the three parties. I firmly believe that all of you present will approve of our actions, and you will also wish us success in our efforts to seek honorable peace."</p>
<p>Belgian Prime Minister Janson then delivered a speech, explaining the consistency of British and French actions, saying, "Since the governments of Britain and France are doing their best to find a solution, the League of Nations should entrust the two countries to carry out their work in the spirit of the League of Nations Charter and under the supervision of the Charter."</p>
<p>Soviet representative Potemkin said that the conflict in Africa is no different from the conflict in Europe. The only attitude that all countries can take is to resolutely implement sanctions. However, if a peaceful solution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute can be established within the scope of the League of Nations, the Soviet Union will also welcome it.</p>
<p>Spanish representative Madariaga expressed his approval of the declarations made by Laval, Hoare, and Janson.</p>
<p>Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu expressed his hope in the name of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente that peace would be restored under fair conditions in accordance with the spirit of the League of Nations Charter so that international obligations and the genuine friendship between these countries and Italy could be harmonized without conflicting with each other.</p>
<p>Then, Swiss representative Motta, Argentine representative Gnaschi, and Peruvian representative Totela successively delivered speeches, hoping that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute could be resolved peacefully in accordance with the Charter.</p>
<p>Finally, the Coordination Committee unanimously passed the proposal of Belgian Prime Minister Janson, entrusting the British and French governments to seek a peaceful solution. The meeting was adjourned by the Chairman of the Sanctions Committee, Vasconcelos, at 5:40 p.m. (2nd, Havas)</p>

When asked about the conversation with Italian representative Aloisi, the Foreign Secretary replied that it was easier to make contact because the representatives of all countries gathered in Geneva. Therefore, he took the opportunity to attend the Sanctions Committee meeting and held a meeting with the Italian representative.

<h3 id="e30">Naval Mutual Assistance: British and French Merchants Reach Compromise, Expanding to Army, Navy, and Air Force Cooperation, Further Establishing a Defensive Alliance <a href="#e30" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c30" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">30</a></h3>
<p>(London) British and French naval experts recently met here to discuss naval cooperation between the two countries. Our correspondent has learned that the experts have reached a complete compromise and will expand from naval cooperation to army, navy, and air force cooperation in the near future. During the League of Nations' implementation of sanctions against Italy, they will further establish a British-French defensive alliance to realize close understanding between the two countries under this cooperative approach. Britain, in the Mediterranean Sea, from east to west, from Alexandria, Egypt, to the Strait of Gibraltar, is like a chain, in which only the situation of Malta is clearly a weakness. The British Admiralty is keenly aware of this, so it is eager to promote British-French cooperation. Not only that,</p>
<p>Utilizing Mediterranean Ports: Britain in Contact with Various Countries</p>
<p>The British government has recently been deeply concerned about enabling its navy to utilize the naval bases of other countries. Therefore, it recently began negotiations with the Spanish government to utilize the port of Mahon in the Balearic Islands (on the island of Minorca). It also contacted the Greek government to utilize the port of Argostoli in Greece. In addition, it is rumored that the British government has also contacted the Albanian government, intending to exchange loans for the British navy to utilize Albanian ports. The Albanian government is undoubtedly very welcome to this, especially after Italy's financial difficulties made it unable to provide assistance. However, the ports of the above countries are far inferior to the French port of Toulon and the port of Bizerte in the French colony of Tunisia in terms of geography and facilities. This is why the British Admiralty attaches great importance to British-French cooperation. Although the compromise reached by the two countries this time is effective during the period of implementing sanctions, it is possible that it will be extended due to the British Admiralty's urgent need to maintain naval security in the Mediterranean Sea.</p>
<p>Guaranteeing the Security of the Rhine: British Exchange Conditions for France</p>
<p>According to officials, the British government will also jointly guarantee the security of the Rhine River as an exchange condition for French naval assistance. According to information obtained by our correspondent, the British government is currently planning various measures to immediately assist France in the event of danger on the Rhine River.</p>
<p>Rumor that the League of Nations will be Reorganized with its Task Limited to Consultation</p>
<p>Furthermore, after the British-French cooperation is resolved, the League of Nations will also be reorganized. The League of Nations will publicly acknowledge its inability to eliminate war disasters worldwide, so the League of Nations' mission in the future will be limited to consultation. The United States, Germany, and Japan will undoubtedly welcome its rejoining the League of Nations. In all countries, various groups will be formed through mutual assistance treaties, according to different regions. If a conflict occurs in the East European and Central European regions, Britain will not want to be involved. However, France has obligations in these regions and may force Britain into involvement against its will.</p>
<p>On the Issues of Central and Eastern Europe: Britain will Decide Based on France's Attitude</p>
<p>Therefore, if France can abandon its obligations to Eastern and Central Europe, Britain will be prepared to sign regional mutual assistance agreements with France and Belgium. Furthermore, France should not ratify the French-Russian mutual assistance treaty signed in May of this year, and its opposition to the German-Austrian merger should also be abandoned. According to informed sources, representatives of Britain and France have discussed the above issues in Geneva. According to our correspondent, the British viewpoint is based on Germany's promise that if other countries allow Germany to take free action in the East, it will not take offensive action in the West.

<p>(Geneva) The Sanctions Coordination Committee is scheduled to reconvene on Wednesday to discuss the implementation of economic sanctions against Italy starting November 18. British Foreign Secretary Hoare will not be able to attend the meeting and will be replaced by Under-Secretary of State Cranborne. At yesterday's committee meeting, the proposal by Belgian Prime Minister Zeeland that Britain and France should continue to work to restore peace was discussed. Representatives of Switzerland, Argentina, Romania, and Peru supported the proposal. The Polish representative stated that such a mandate could only be given by the League of Nations' Executive Council. The chairman then stated that he dared to interpret the sentiments of the meeting as decisively supporting the proposal. The committee announced the adjournment until November 6, after designating a subcommittee to consider financial and economic mutual assistance issues. (Reuters, 3rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) Forty-three member states are prepared to implement financial sanctions, and thirty-nine are prepared to implement economic sanctions. The above countries should submit notifications of the steps taken to the League of Nations Secretariat as soon as possible. The Coordination Committee then designated various committees to meet on Monday to study the measures passed today to make them perfect. Regarding the proposal by the Canadian representative to include coal, iron, and oil in the list of items prohibited from being exported to Italy, it will be studied by the Economic Sanctions Committee. It is generally believed that the United States and Germany are the main producers of the above items, and neither country is a member of the League of Nations, so the Canadian proposal is difficult to implement. The eighteen-nation subcommittee is scheduled to meet on the 6th of this month to approve the resolutions passed by the various committees. (Havas News Agency, 2nd)</p>
<h3 id="e33">The Military Situation Between Italy and Abyssinia <a href="#e33" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c33" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">33</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Chi</p>
<p>——Geographical Observations</p>
<p>One</p>
<p>The Italo-Abyssinian War, which has shaken the world, has been raging for a full month since it broke out. The mechanized Italian army fought hard for three days and nights before finally capturing Adowa, a border town in Abyssinia. The humiliation of the Italian army's defeat in that town in 1896 was finally wiped away. Since then, apart from the continued fall of the sacred city of Aksum near Adowa, the Italian army has hardly achieved any significant victories. According to recent telegrams, the two armies on the northern front are engaged in fierce fighting in the area of Makale, north of the Tekezé River, and the two armies on the southern front are still in a stalemate near Walwal in the Ogaden region. Even if the Tigray Province and the Ogaden region all fall into Mussolini's hands, the Italian army will only have achieved preliminary victories. The more important and difficult decisive battles in the hinterland are yet to come.</p>
<p>Speaking of the war in the hinterland, the Italian army is not necessarily very confident. Originally, the Italian army only had significant advantages in weapons such as airplanes, tanks, and cannons. However, these modern weapons would lose most of their effectiveness in the high mountains of the Abyssinian hinterland. At the same time, judging from morale, especially from the terrain, the final victory may belong to the Abyssinian army. Now, let's examine the general trend of the Italo-Abyssinian War based solely on the geographical characteristics of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Two</p>
<p>This time, Italy's large-scale invasion of Abyssinia began with its northern military base, Eritrea. This narrow strip of land along the Red Sea has a mild climate, suitable for Europeans to live in, and its central plateau is connected to the Abyssinian Plateau, making it a ready-made foothold for Italy to attack southward. However, Eritrea also has a major shortcoming, which is its sparse rainfall, which is almost always arid throughout the year. Therefore, this place has almost no products, but in terms of economic status, it is enough to control a small amount of the northern Abyssinia's overseas trade.</p>
<p>Italy obviously cannot obtain much economic benefit from this barren colony, so it covets the adjacent Abyssinian Plateau area. This is the only area in the entire Abyssinia suitable for colonization by Caucasians. Not only is the land relatively fertile, but the climate is also quite mild. The Amhara-speaking Abyssinians who believe in Christianity all live there, ruling the people of various races around them. We may use the entire area above 5,000 feet above sea level to represent this plateau area. Among them, there are many high mountains exceeding 10,000 feet, and the mountains in the north are even as high as 15,000 feet. At the eastern end of the plateau, the terrain suddenly drops, forming a large desert. This vast lowland, called the Danakil Depression, is the northern part of the Rift Valley. Some parts of the Danakil Depression are lower than sea level. This can be said to be the most desolate place in the world. Only two European expeditions have ever safely passed through this area. The leader of one expedition, Ludovico Nerbitt, gave it the name "trap of the underworld." The Rift Valley becomes narrower and narrower to the south, forming a ditch that separates the main Abyssinian Plateau from the Somali Plateau. Climbing the central plateau from the southern end of this Rift Valley is much easier than climbing from the northern area. The Gala people invaded Abyssinia from there in the 16th century.</p>
<p>The topographical feature of northern Abyssinia is the deep trenches formed by the Tekezé River and its tributaries that pass through the plateau. These river channels are often half a mile deep and have no bridges on them, which cuts off the invaders' advance from north to south. The Italian army in Eritrea has almost no way to penetrate into Abyssinia except by attacking southeastward through the Adowa area. Therefore, after the Italian army occupied Adowa, it attacked Magale and Mek'ele around the southeastern edge of the town's mountains. This route is the old route of the Italian army's invasion of Abyssinia in 1868.</p>
<p>The main target of the Italian army on this route is actually the mountains east and north of Lake Tana. The Atbara River, the Tekezé River, and the Blue Nile, on which the farmland of eastern Sudan and Egypt rely for irrigation, originate from these mountains. If the Italian army controls the sources of these rivers, especially the large reservoir of the Blue Nile, Lake Tana, then it will not only be easy to conquer Abyssinia, but it can also control the fate of Egypt and eastern Sudan.</p>
<p>However, it is very difficult for the Italian army to achieve such a goal. First, this offensive route passes through many high mountains and difficult-to-cross canyons, and there are almost no suitable roads and necessary bridges. The motorized Italian army cannot advance until the highway leading to Eritrea in the rear is built section by section and bridges are erected over the canyons along the way. Most of the materials used for bridge construction, road construction, and other military projects have to be transported from distant places. Even if the bridges, supply stations, and mountain roads hurriedly built by the road workers accompanying the army are completed, there is still a risk of being washed away by sudden flash floods at any time. Second, there are very few plains among the mountains of the Abyssinian Plateau. Except for the Lake Tana area and the basins of several other lakes, it is not easy to find a base for large armies to station. Such a terrain is only suitable for guerrilla warfare and not for modern tactics. Guerrilla warfare is what the Abyssinians are good at. In 1896, they relied on this tactic to win a glorious victory in Adowa. The deeper the Italian army penetrates into the plateau area, the more it has to be wary of being surrounded and attacked by Abyssinian guerrillas or having its communication lines cut off. Third, Abyssinia's agricultural products are only enough to supply the simple needs of the Abyssinian people. It is very difficult for the European expeditionary force to find the food and daily necessities it needs there. In fact, almost all of the Italian army's various military supplies have to be shipped from overseas to the plateau. Not only is the transportation cost extremely high, but this is also a difficult problem.</p>
<p>Three</p>
<p>Now, let's examine the military situation on the southern front. In this regard, the Italian Somaliland, the Italian army's base, is significantly different from Eritrea. This is part of the vast semi-desert region of East Africa. British and French Somaliland and northeastern and southeastern Abyssinia are all included in that semi-desert region. Italian Somaliland is close to the equator, and the climate is so hot that Caucasians often cannot bear it. The indigenous population is over one million, almost all living a primitive agricultural and nomadic life. The Juba River and the Webi Shabelle River originate from the northern plateau. If the Italian army wants to go to Abyssinia from the port of Mogadishu, it has to go up these two rivers, or pass through two hundred miles of barren desert before seeing the springs in Walwal, Gerlogubi, and other places. The military value of these springs is obvious.</p>
<p>The fierce fighting between the Italian and Abyssinian armies in the Ogaden region the other day was to争夺 these springs. However, Mussolini doesn't value the Ogaden region, which has few springs. He said that he didn't want to be a collector of "barren land." His preliminary military goals on the southern front are still several strategic locations in the northern part of the Somali Plateau in Hararghe Province. The Italian army is currently using Walwal and Gerlogubi as military bases to attack in that direction. If it occupies the strategic locations on the Somali Plateau, the Italian army will gain two major benefits: (1) The Italian army can control the entire basin of the two major rivers in Italian Somaliland, and (2) The Italian army can control the Hafasi River section of the Rift Valley; The Djibouti-Addis Ababa Railway passes through there. Even if this only way for Abyssinia to reach the sea is not occupied by the Italian army, the Italian army can still completely control it from the strategic locations in the northern part of the Somali Plateau.</p>
<p>However, there are also several difficulties in the advance of the Italian army on the southern front, namely, the hot weather, the long distance, and the lack of drinking water. Moreover, as on the northern front, while marching, it is necessary to build a motor road from the front line directly to the Indian Ocean, otherwise it will be inconvenient for supply. Even if it does not encounter fierce resistance from the Gala people and local Islamic tribes along the way, even if the Italian army occupies the lowlands and slightly higher areas of eastern or southeastern Abyssinia, the natural barriers of the plateau mountains are still not easy to break through.</p>
<p>Four</p>
<p>Although Mussolini intends to conquer the entire Abyssinia within this dry season, judging from the geographical situation of this invaded country, his wish may be difficult to fulfill. Moreover, the valiant resistance of the Abyssinian army over the past month is proving that the Abyssinian people are indeed a warlike nation. Although they lack modern weapons, they can resist foreign enemies with their natural barriers and brave spirit of defending their country. They have such difficult-to-attack terrain and can fully adapt to the local environment. In any case, this is an important military condition that the Italian army cannot match. The Abyssinian people can run 25 to 40 miles on rugged mountain roads every day without feeling tired for many days in a row. They raise local mules that do not need good feed, but are agile and hardworking, and can carry machine guns and small mountain artillery to any steep location. The Abyssinian army uses these weapons to create strong defensive lines that make the Italian army helpless.</p>
<p>If the Italian army cannot end the military operations in Abyssinia within the dry season, then the war will have to be suspended or delayed when the rainy season comes. Why? Because in Abyssinia, places below 6,000 feet above sea level are covered with a kind of yellow mud, which is dry and brittle in the dry season, but turns into soap-like mire when it rains, making it impossible to walk even on the road. If tank teams encounter a rainstorm in the yellow mud area, they will inevitably get stuck in the mire and have to wait until the sun dries the soil before they can move.</p>
<p>The Italo-Abyssinian War may evolve into a protracted guerrilla war after this dry season. Didn't Cyrenaica in Libya have about twenty years of guerrilla warfare? That place is much closer to Italy, and the number of Islamic residents is less than 200,000. If the Italian army's invasion of Abyssinia really lasts for a long time, then the Italian side's costly military expenditure and the sacrifices of the people may cause serious problems at home.</p>

<p>At about 7 p.m. on October 28, vehicles Nos. 2-1993 and 2200, rented by the Japanese military, suddenly arrived at the Tianjin News Examination Office with 19 plainclothes Japanese military police. After entering the gate, they went straight to the office to inquire about the person in charge. At that time, Director Zhuang Yuling was out and had not returned. Deputy Director Wang Yifan received them and asked about their intentions. The Japanese said that the consulate had something to ask and asked him to go with them. Afterwards, they forced Wang Yifan and five staff members, Jiang Liangjun, Du Yunyu, Yao Jingxiu, and Zhu Yongnian, into the car and took them to the Japanese military headquarters in Haiguang Temple. At first, they were imprisoned in an ordinary room, and then they were taken to the detention center (detention center). Until the afternoon of the 29th, Du Yunyu questioned in Japanese about the reason for the arrest and asked for an interrogation. The staff officer Ishii questioned in detail about the organization of the news examination office, the meaning of the examination, and the root cause. Wang Yifan replied that the examination office was established under the central government's order to examine and suppress speech against the government and insipid remarks, and to censor reports and essays that would harm diplomatic relations according to the Good Neighborliness Order. Ishii said that such examinations were inevitably too passive. For example, the recent Xianghe incident was a genuine mass movement, so why not make efforts to publicize it? Wang replied that the examination office's authority can only check and withhold news, and cannot publicize any news. The right to publish similar incidents in Xianghe rests with the newspapers, and the examination office has no power to force them to publish it. Ishii was speechless and released them at 5 p.m. on the same day. Before they were released, the Tianjin Municipal Government had sent Secretary General Sun Runyu and Japanese Secretary Liu Shaoxian to visit the Japanese military headquarters and the Japanese consulate to inquire about the truth of the arrest, but they refused to tell the truth. It was not until the people were released that they knew the reason for the arrest.</p>
<p>Nian Guangyao, executive committee member of the Tianjin Chamber of Commerce, was arrested by the Japanese military police and the police of the Third Branch of the Tianjin Public Security Bureau on October 29 at the Baoyang Hotel, also accused of being related to the Blue Shirts Society. He has not been released yet. Nian once served as a backbone member of a certain society and had many grievances with people. This summer, someone informed the Japanese side that Nian was a member of an anti-Japanese society. The Japanese side once sent someone to the Chamber of Commerce to investigate and protested to the municipal government. Nian resigned and did not work at the Chamber of Commerce, but he was still unable to avoid disaster.</p>
<p>Li Ming, director of the Second Section of the Tianjin Social Affairs Bureau (the bureau's reorganization order has not been issued yet, according to the organizational charter, Li is the position of section chief), returned to his home in the British Concession from Hebei at about 5 p.m. on October 30. When he arrived near the Jingang Bridge, he was suddenly stopped head-on by a car. Three Japanese men jumped out of the car, all in plainclothes, and told Li that they were military police from the Japanese Military Police Headquarters and were going to the headquarters in Qingdao for questioning. Under duress, Li was forced into the car and taken to the military police headquarters in the Japanese Concession. Li's chauffeur went back to report that Li was missing. On the 31st, the municipal government received the report and sent Japanese Secretary Liu Shaokun to inquire with the Japanese side. According to the Japanese side, Li was a member of the Blue Shirts Society, and the military police had received a report, so they arrested him. Negotiations are still underway, and there is no news of his release. His family is also not allowed to visit. According to general investigations, Li has been the director of the Social Affairs Bureau for many years. In resolving previous labor unrest, he inevitably offended some people, so he was framed by traitors. (November 1)</p>
<h3 id="e64">Fuzhou: Commerce Increasingly Declining, Due to Stagnant Sales of Products <a href="#e64" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c64" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">64</a></h3>
<p>Fuzhou Newsletter: The commerce of Fujian Province is divided into two major regions: northern and eastern Fujian, with Fuzhou as the collection and distribution center, and southern and western Fujian, with Xiamen as the collection and distribution center. However, Fuzhou has always been an export port, while Xiamen has always been an import port. This is because tea, wood, paper, bamboo shoots, and other goods produced in eastern and northern Fujian are exported through Fuzhou. Most of these goods are sold to the Northeast and northern provinces. Since the fall of the Northeast, sales have dropped by more than half. Since the beginning of this summer, the Yellow River has caused disasters, and sales in the north have also been cut off. Export goods have plummeted, resulting in a change from export surplus to import surplus. As for imports, daily necessities from various counties in northern Fujian used to be transported from Fuzhou, and the amount of annual trade was huge. There was a so-called "Creek Transportation Gang" who specialized in transporting goods from Fuzhou to northern Fujian. Every year at the beginning of winter, merchants from northern Fujian came to the province to purchase New Year's goods, especially fine cloth, Suzhou and Guangdong goods, food, candles, and firecrackers. The market called this period the winter sales period. The annual profit and loss of the Creek Transportation Gang was determined during this period. However, this year, the winter sales period has already arrived, but the Fuzhou market is still very cold, and the business of the Creek Transportation Gang is even more declining. The reason for this is that half of it is due to the stagnation of sales of export products, the economic depression of society, and the weakening of purchasing power. The other half is due to the opening of the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway and the Fujian-Zhejiang Highway, allowing goods to be transported directly from Shanghai to various counties in northern Fujian via the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, the Hangzhou-Jiangshan Railway, and the Fujian-Zhejiang Highway (the Fujian-Zhejiang Highway connects from Jiangshan and passes through Pucheng, Jianyang, Jian'ou, and reaches Yanping), which is much simpler than transporting goods from Shanghai by sea to Fuzhou and then from Fuzhou by river to northern Fujian. Therefore, merchants abandon the former and choose the latter. There are still some merchants who come to the province to purchase goods because Shanghai requires cash payment, while Fuzhou can repay in installments. Therefore, merchants generally expect that after the completion of the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway, Yanping will become the commercial distribution center in northern Fujian, and the Fuzhou market will be naturally eliminated due to changes in the inland transportation situation. The provincial government is now requesting the central government to extend the Fujian-Jiangxi Railway from Yanping to Fuzhou to maintain the prosperity of the provincial capital, but it is not known whether it can be realized. In addition, Fuzhou has recently experienced a surge in bankruptcies due to poor business conditions, and the order of the market is very chaotic. The provincial government has specially ordered the Public Security Bureau and the County Chamber of Commerce to jointly form the Provincial Capital Store Bankruptcy Liquidation Committee, with Public Security Bureau Chief Li Jinde and Chamber of Commerce Chairman Luo Mianhou serving as the chairman and vice-chairman respectively. Stores that are unable to operate due to poor turnover can request the committee to find ways to maintain or mediate. Those who deliberately abscond will be strictly investigated to curb the bankruptcy trend. (November 2)</p>
<p>Songjiang: Summary of Winter Defense Meeting</p>
<p>In the Punan districts of this county, banditry has occurred frequently. As the winter defense season is approaching, the county government specially convened a winter defense meeting yesterday, attended by the Public Security Bureau, the 12th Security Brigade Headquarters, and the district chiefs of each district. County Chief Li presided over the meeting. Zhao Zanchen, the adjutant of the Security Brigade, presented cases regarding increasing defenses, joint defense, meeting sentries, and protecting vehicles, which were discussed in detail. Regarding the defense of the urban area, it was decided to follow the previous session's established case, which will be implemented from the 16th of this month.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Agricultural Bank of China Warrants Arrest of Absconding Staff Member</p>
<p>Wang Cainan (Zhengrong), the director of the cashier department of the Suzhou Agricultural Bank of China, absconded with 150,000 yuan of public funds, and there has been no news of his whereabouts so far. The bank has now offered a reward of 3,000 yuan for his arrest. After this incident occurred, Hou Houpei, the deputy governor of the head office, came to Suzhou in person to investigate. It was learned that another important staff member had embezzled more than 40,000 yuan, and there were also corrupt practices in the collateral section. Therefore, the head office ordered the governor of the Suzhou branch, Zhu Qingzeng, to return all the funds released in his hands within the year. It is also heard that there are plans to reorganize the Suzhou branch. The Suzhou branch has a total deposit of more than 800,000 yuan. Since the incident of Wang Cainan's absconding occurred, a large amount has been withdrawn. Fortunately, the branch has sufficient reserves and can still cope with it easily.</p>
<p>Reorganization of Business Corps into Civilian Defense Teams</p>
<p>Each branch of the Suzhou Business Corps was originally scheduled to start defense on the 15th of this month, assisting the police and maintaining local public security. The necessary defense funds have been requested from the County Chamber of Commerce. Recently, the County Government was instructed by the Provincial Government to abolish all business corps immediately and reorganize them into civilian defense teams under the command of the town chiefs and baojia chiefs. Therefore, the head of the corps, Ji Xiaosong, will convene a meeting of the heads of each department within days to discuss all the closing arrangements.</p>
<p>Changshu: Fire Brigade Conflict with Telephone Company</p>
<p>The conflict between the Central District Fire Brigade and the Telephone Company here is escalating. The Fire Brigade has stopped responding to fire alarms, and all the workers of the Telephone Company have gone on strike at the same time, with both sides standing in opposition. The reason for this incident is that the Central District Fire Brigade, in order to receive news quickly, connected a switchboard at the motor of the Zui Jing Ge Bookstore. The company considered this a violation of the regulations and confiscated the Fire Brigade's switchboard and cut the bookstore's telephone line, suspending the call. This caused negotiations. The Bureau Chief of Public Security mediated it, and reconnected the telephone of Zui Jing Ge first. Unexpectedly, the fire brigade reconnected the switchboard, and the Telephone Company sent craftsman Yang Shun Gao to remove it, but they were beaten by Wang Guo Liang and others from the fire brigade, which intensified the conflict. Because the Telephone Company workers were beaten for no reason, they announced a complete strike, believing they had no protection. The fire brigade has also made a major alliance, and formally announced cessation of fire fighting activities, further escalating the situation. The telephone company is planning to sue the county government.</p>
<p>Japanese Residents Come to Changshu for Sightseeing</p>
<p>On the evening of the 2nd, eight Japanese employees of the Datong Shipping Company on Sichuan Road, Shanghai, Hiroya Masashi, Nakayama Masahira, Yasawa Yoshitsugu, and Koazuma Masao, accompanied by a Chinese man Ye Qing, came to Changshu for sightseeing in their own cars. In the evening, when they were dining at Jin Fang Yuan, they summoned many prostitutes. The Public Security Bureau went to detain the prostitutes because calling prostitutes violated the prohibition regulations. As for Japanese businessmen traveling in the inland, many plainclothes police officers were specially sent to protect them and monitor their actions.</p>
<p>Provincial Committee Inspects Opium Suppression</p>
<p>The Provincial Opium Prohibition Committee, in order to examine the opium prohibition work of the branch committees in various counties and the business situation of opium paste shops, specially sent members to visit each county for assessment. Wu Xie, who was sent to this county, arrived on the 1st of this month. He first went to the fourth section of the county government to adjust the volume for inspection, and set off on the 2nd to visit the opium paste shops and smoking cessation hospitals.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Representatives Assembly of Rice and Bean Industries</p>
<p>This county's rice and bean industry, where merchants carry goods and sell them together, has a long-standing practice of mortgaging rice and grain stores to banks for funds, without issuing promissory notes. Indirectly, the banks are responsible for the loan. Recently, the banks in this county have intended to change the grain mortgage regulations, requiring promissory notes for warehouse receipt mortgages, otherwise it would be difficult to use. The bean industry believes that this encroaches on their business rights and sent a letter to the County Chamber of Commerce to consult with the Banking Association and ask them to postpone the implementation. Now, the Rice and Bean Industry specially convened a meeting of eight section representatives on the 3rd to discuss the banks' change of grain mortgage methods. It was decided that banks should be responsible for ordering merchants to issue promissory notes, but property rights should be protected. Otherwise, the merchants would be acting on behalf of their customers, and the responsibility would be difficult to establish, and there would be no way to grip the situation. Banks should be asked to issue receipts to prove it, which would be fair. For the customers, the old cases should be re-examined and all should sign pledges to provide security and responsibility. In addition, the association will designate Li Zhongchen to go to Shanghai to gather at the Fifth Plenary Session and petition to abolish the Guangdong special donation case for the miscellaneous grain and oil industries across the country.</p>
<p>Changzhou: Business Corps Abolished by Order</p>
<p>The Wu county business corps, organized by the County Chamber of Commerce, has managed by a separate commission and have done well in years of drills and rectifications. Recently, the County Government received an order from the province, to unify local military powers in order to actually carry out the security system, all business corps names in towns of the various counties are cancelled from November 1, and it should be reorganized into the civilian defense reserve team or watchtowers. The County Government immediately ordered the County Chamber of Commerce Headquarters and directed the various detachments and teams to act accordingly. Meeting with the district and town chiefs, baojia chiefs and other chiefs should immediately reorganize the watchtowers, and send a roster for reporting. Later the County Governor is responsible to send members to train in order to improve.</p>
<p>Zhenjiang: Dredging of Fragrant Herb River Not Extended</p>
<p>Danyang's dredging of the Xiangcao River was originally scheduled to begin on November 15 of this year and be completed on March 15 of next year. The Danyang Grain Food Industry telegraphed the Construction Department asking for a month's extension to allow Danyang's bulk agricultural product, brown rice, to be sold in time to avoid being shelved and missing the opportunity. After receiving the report, the Construction Department rejected the extension on the grounds that the river must be dredged during the slack season when the water is dry to avoid delaying the opportunity, and that the dredging period would not hinder the transportation and sales of grain.</p>
<p>Yangzhou: Transportation Bureau Acting as Agent for Honghu Dike</p>
<p>The Jiangbei Transportation Engineering Bureau believes that the Jiangbei Honghu Dike should be handled by the Guidong-Huaihe River into the Sea Engineering Office. The Guidong-Huaihe River into the Sea Engineering Office said that it was busy with engineering work, and sent a letter to the agency to be responsible for acting as an agent. Yesterday (the 1st) it ordered Feng Dan, the director of the Huaiqi section engineering office, to be responsible for handling the project. The required expenses of 80,000 yuan should be provided in three phases. In addition, the construction of the floodgates in the Xiangyun East-West Dyke project has been slowed down for the purposes of irrigation. Now it has also borrowed funds from the Agricultural Bank of China and notified Renchang Construction Factory, the contractor for the dike, to sign supplementary articles in order to complete it on schedule. The time limit is fifty clear days.</p>
<p>Huaiyin: Completion of Two Major Constructions</p>
<p>The county's urban and rural telephone network was installed in late October and was officially opened for calls and business on the 1st of this month. Generally, the fee is one cent per Chinese mile. In addition to District 1, the locations where calls can be made include five in Districts 2, 3, and three in District 4, and one in Matou Township. If you want to call outside this county, you can also connect with the provincial exchange. In addition, the Qingjiang Zheng and Yue floodgates outside the East Gate are the daily traffic arteries between urban and rural areas. The Four Floodgates Management Office had previously said that the two floodgates had been in disrepair for years, and all the paved boards on the floodgates and the beams under the floodgates were to be replaced. The Yue floodgate has been dismantled and repaired first, and the work has been completed long ago. Now the Zheng floodgate has been continuously repaired. After a total of one week, the work was completed on the evening of October 31. Traffic was officially restored on the morning of the 1st.</p>
<p>Hangzhou: Yu-Nan Section to Be Completed by the End of This Month</p>
<p>Along the line of the Yu-Nan section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, malaria was previously prevalent and spread very severely. Many road workers were infected and died, which affected the progress of the project. After sending personnel with a large number of drugs for prevention and treatment, the epidemic gradually subsided. The track laying project reached Geyang on the 1st of this month. From the 3rd, the construction train will sell passenger tickets, but because the location is remote, it will not be officially opened for business for the time being. The track-laying project for the entire section will be connected with each other by the 25th of this month, and the Thirteen-Arch Liangjiadu Bridge has completed ten of them. The Guixi Bridge is scheduled to be completed by the end of this month, and the entire section will be completed. The opening ceremony will be held in early December.</p>
<p>Ningbo: Cooperative Director of Fritillaria Bulb Arrested</p>
<p>Since the Fritillaria Bulb Transportation and Sales Cooperative was established in November 1932, disputes have arisen due to poor management. The Construction Department suspended the directors and supervisors of the cooperative and appointed Ding Xitang, Ni Weixiong, and Zhang Tong to take over and reorganize it. After the reorganization committee members went to the cooperative on the 30th to take over, they found in the handover of accounts that the directors of the cooperative had embezzled and engaged in corrupt practices. The directors of the cooperative, Zheng Jiahao, Cui Qianyu, Xu Youheng, Wang Yuankang, Yang Jinduan, Liu Qiyin, Cui Yongmao, and Xu Xilin, were all detained and escorted to the Yinxian District Administrative Inspector's Office for verification. That night, they all paid bail and were released to await interrogation.</p>

<p>U.S. Vice President Garner, Speaker of the House of Representatives Byrns, and a congressional delegation totaling 134 men and women traveled from the United States to the Philippines to attend the inauguration ceremony of the new government. En route, they passed through China, arriving in Shanghai on the morning of the 2nd aboard the Dollar Steamship Lines' President Grant from Japan. They were warmly received by Chinese authorities and American officials and residents. With the inauguration ceremony of the new Philippine government approaching, they concluded their social engagements and, that evening, accompanied by a welcoming delegation from the Philippines, including Delgado, Coffila, Pacis, Onan Kakiao, Zamora, and Osman Nalla, departed in batches from the Customs Wharf around midnight aboard small ferries, returning to their original ship. They set sail from Shanghai at 4:30 AM yesterday, planning to attend the inauguration ceremony of the new Philippine government on the 15th of this month. Afterward, they will depart the Philippines on the 20th aboard the President Jackson, returning home via the same route through Shanghai.</p>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that U.S. Vice President Garner issued a farewell letter to China before departing Shanghai yesterday morning, which was submitted to the Central News Agency for publication. The translation is as follows: "I, on behalf of the government of the United States and the Congressional delegation to the Philippines, express our deepest gratitude to the Chinese people for their warm hospitality. Special thanks are due to Minister Kong and Mayor Wu for their kind invitations to grand banquets and tea parties. All this kindness has further strengthened our feeling of the sincerity and friendliness of the Chinese people, and our belief in the boundless growth of amity between the Chinese and American peoples. We regret that our visit was so brief, but we hope to have the opportunity for a more leisurely discussion when we return from the Philippines in the future." John Nance Garner (signed)</p>
<h3 id="e68">Dai Chuanxian and Ma Chaojun to Arrive in Shanghai Together Today; Will Take Ship South Tomorrow to Convey the Opinions of Various Committee Members; Chen, Li, and Others to Accompany Them North to Attend the Plenary Session <a href="#e68" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c68" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">68</a></h3>
<p>The Xin Xin News Agency reports that the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee officially opened on the 1st of this month. Central Committee members from various regions, believing that in this season of the gradual pacification of the bandit suppression military operations, it is crucial to unite sincerely and work together harmoniously to strengthen the foundations of the nation, have spared no effort to travel long distances to Beijing to attend the meeting, participate in discussions, and jointly deliberate on major plans. As a result, the number of attending committee members is unprecedented in this session, a cause of great joy not only to comrades within the party but also to the entire nation. Unexpectedly, Premier Wang was unfortunately injured in an assassination attempt by thugs shortly after the opening ceremony. Upon hearing this news, public sentiment was outraged. The Assembly, in addition to telegraphing a detailed report of the assassination of Premier Wang to all parties, decided to dispatch two members, Dai Chuanxian and Ma Chaojun, to travel south as quickly as possible to urge Central Committee members Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and others, who are staying in Guangdong and Guangxi, to come north to Beijing as soon as possible to attend the session. This would fully demonstrate the spirit of unity and struggle. According to inquiries by the Xin Xin News Agency, Dai and Ma are scheduled to arrive in Shanghai from Beijing on the 4th and will board the Empress of Asia, which departs from Shanghai on the 5th, to travel south and meet with Chen Jitang, Li Zongren, and others, conveying the opinions of the committee members in Beijing. Sources also indicate that the reason Chen, Li, and others have been unable to come north to attend the plenary session is that they are tied down by military and political affairs and cannot find the time to leave Guangdong. Now that the Central Government has repeatedly urged them, they will certainly make time within the realm of possibility to travel to Beijing to attend the plenary session and jointly deliberate on national affairs. After meeting with Dai and Ma, they may travel north together by plane.</p>

<h3 id="e73">Australian Mission to Shanghai Commercial Commissioner Hopes That Domestic Industrial and Commercial Leaders Will Quickly and Carefully Review Past Losses of Our Country <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>The Huadong News Agency reports that Mr. Wang Gongfang, Vice-Consul of our country's Consulate General in Sydney, recently sent a letter to the International Trade Bureau, detailing the mission of the newly appointed Australian Commercial Commissioner to Shanghai and the future of Sino-Australian trade. The following is a record of the investigation by the Huadong News Agency reporter: (Omitted above) Among the Eastern countries, Australia's trade is most important with China, Japan, and the Dutch East Indies. In recent years, the export of Australian agricultural products, meat, butter, etc., to England has been captured by South American countries such as Argentina, which has had a significant impact. Therefore, it is urgent to change the policy and find new markets in the East to compensate. In April of last year, after Australian Foreign Minister Latham visited various countries in the East, he proposed sending commercial commissioners to China, Japan, and Nanyang. Due to careful selection of personnel, the time was slightly delayed. In May of this year, the official appointments of the principal and deputy commercial commissioners to the three places were successively announced. The appointed Commercial Commissioner to Shanghai is Mr. Bowden, V.G. Bowden, and the Deputy Commercial Commissioner to Shanghai is Mr. Nutt, A.L. Nutt. Mr. Bowden returned to Australia in May of this year to travel to major ports with Mr. Nutt to contact and discuss plans to promote Sino-Australian trade with local industrial and commercial leaders. Mr. Bowden and Mr. Nutt arrived in Shanghai on September 9 to take up their new posts. Representatives stationed abroad by Australia include the Chief Representative appointed by the Commonwealth of Australia in London, England. The current incumbent is Bruce, who served as the Australian Prime Minister after the European War. He is permanently stationed in London to discuss various matters related to the entire Australia with the British government. The representative also serves as Australia's plenipotentiary representative to the League of Nations. In addition, the six states of Australia each send a representative to London. The six representatives are responsible for finding ways to promote the products of their respective states in England. Australia has a commercial office in Paris, which is controlled by the chief representative stationed in London. Since 1918, Australia has had a representative office in New York. In April 1929, a commercial commissioner was appointed in Toronto, Canada. In 1934, another commercial commissioner was appointed in New Zealand. In our country, a commercial commissioner was appointed in the tenth year of the Republic, with a general office in Shanghai and branch offices in Hong Kong. However, it was canceled in the twelfth year of the Republic because it did not achieve any results. When it was discussed again this time, there was considerable debate about the location in China. Some people advocated changing the location to Hong Kong, the reasons being (1) most of the overseas Chinese in Australia are from Guangdong, (2) the center of China's trade with Australia is also in Hong Kong and Guangzhou. However, others argued that Hong Kong belongs to British territory, and if stationed there, it would inevitably give the Chinese people an unpleasant feeling. In reality, Shanghai is indeed the commercial and financial center of China, and Guangzhou is second. The Australian government decided to adopt the latter proposal and stationed the Commercial Commissioner to China in Shanghai. In addition to the above-mentioned location decision, the selection of the Commercial Commissioner and his mission were also carefully discussed. The Australian government, learning from past mistakes, is determined to avoid past failures this time. Only by studying the reasons for past failures can we come up with a plan to correct them. Therefore, the Commonwealth Government's Ministry of Commerce and the Australian Committee on Trade with the East jointly formed a committee to select overseas commercial commissioners. Among the members of the committee was Dr. Melbourne, who had traveled to China and had a good understanding of the situation in our country and was known as a China expert. He wrote an article detailing the qualifications and tasks of the Commercial Commissioner to China, which were adopted by the Australian government. Reading its contents shows the policy and purpose of Australia's trade with China, and it is indeed opening a new situation in Sino-Australian trade. We should first understand the mission of their Commercial Commissioner, which is to increase the sales of Australian goods in China. However, judging from China's trade with Australia over the years, it has always been in an unfavorable position. There are many reasons for this. Now that they are sending personnel to China, they must know our country's needs, which are also stipulated in their duties. Can we afford to miss this opportunity? Therefore, it is hoped that domestic authorities and industrial and commercial leaders should quickly and carefully review the past losses of our country and the methods of remedying them in the future. This kind of unfavorable trade imbalance should be coordinated with our consulates in Australia to achieve effective cooperation. It is advisable to consult with the Commercial Commissioner on effective improvement measures.</p>

<h3 id="e81">The Second Special District Citizens' Association Again Writes to the Municipal Council; Opposes Telephone Charges Based on Usage; If the Company Is Determined to Implement Usage-Based Charges, All Users Will Have No Choice but to Refuse to Pay <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the telephone company's attempt to implement usage-based charges, all users are opposed. The Second Special District Citizens' Association of the French Concession, based on the opinions of all citizens in the district, previously wrote to the French Municipal Council to forward the letter to the telephone company to stop the plan. The association again wrote to the Municipal Council yesterday, asking it to forward the letter to the company and urging it not to implement the plan. The original letter states: "To the French Municipal Council: After the Shanghai Telephone Company requested to increase user rental fees and adopted a usage-based charging method, our association has written to your council to ask it to find a way to stop the plan. We have learned that the Telephone Expert Committee has completed its review, and its report acknowledges that the telephone company should obtain a net profit of 10% by fulfilling the franchise contract. As for its charging method, commercial telephones are charged 10 yuan for 150 calls per month, and household telephones are charged 6.5 yuan for 100 calls per month. An additional charge of 3 fen is levied for each extra call. If calculated according to these numbers, commercial telephones are limited to only 150 calls per month, averaging only 5 calls per day, and household telephones are limited to only 100 calls per month, averaging less than 4 calls per day. However, commercial and household use is much more than 5 or 4 times a day. How much will the price increase if it doubles? How much will the price increase if it triples? The commercial depression is now extremely serious, so how could they bear this heavy burden? Furthermore, if the company restricts calls so strictly, if commercial and household users remove telephones due to low efficiency, or only keep one of the two, or use two-fen postage to communicate, or if they take other measures because they cannot afford to make more than 5 or 4 calls a day, how will the company obtain a 10% net profit? The Expert Committee has not considered this, and only focuses on maintaining the company's net profit. The company is only concerned with its own generous annual interest, without considering whether users can afford it. It insists on going its own way and will not relent. Our association, representing all citizens, cannot agree to this plan. If the company must implement usage-based charges, all users will have no choice but to refuse to pay and let the company remove the telephones. As it relates to social welfare, we are writing to your council again to ask it to consider the public opinion of the citizens, and forward this letter to the company, so that the usage-based charging method will not be implemented in order to appease society and follow public opinion. We extend our best wishes to you and hope for your assistance."</p>

The plan will first be implemented in Shanghai and then expanded to the whole country. The details of the plan are as follows:</p>
<p>Training Talent: The China Children's Welfare Association believes that in order to improve infant care facilities, it is necessary to start with training talent. Therefore, the following guidelines have been set for talent: (1) The directors and existing staff will not be changed, but the directors will be actively requested to implement scientific equipment improvements; (2) Pediatric experts and doctors will be invited to voluntarily take charge of health matters in the facilities and conduct weekly check-ups; (3) Pediatric nurses with nursing diplomas will be hired to manage the cleanliness of the facilities, infant feeding, treatment of minor illnesses, and training of infant caregivers and wet nurses; (4) Ten infant care specialists will be recruited, with a junior high school education and aged 18 to 25. After graduation, they will stay in the facilities to work, specializing in infant nutrition; (5) Wet nurses must undergo physical examinations to check for diseases such as syphilis, gonorrhea, trachoma, and lung disease, as well as to check the quality of their breast milk. After being hired, they should learn basic infant care knowledge. The training of infant care specialists will cover the following subjects: A. Infant care methods such as bathing, bed making, dressing, feeding, etc.; B. Medical common sense; C. Bacteriology; D. Personal hygiene; E. Environmental hygiene; F. Infant nutrition; G. Isolation and disinfection methods; H. Education and visits.</p>
<p>Improving Equipment: Regarding the improvement of infant care facility equipment, it is proposed that the existing infant care facility buildings be used as usual, but the equipment must be improved according to scientific methods, adding infant care and medical departments, infant nutrition departments, infant outdoor recreation halls, bathhouses, sickrooms, isolation rooms, and sterilizers. Every infant care facility should have the following equipment: (1) Adding an infant care training class with ten students, graduating in two months, with food costs of 140 yuan and book costs of 30 yuan; (2) Adding a health and medical department, with equipment costs of 150 yuan; (3) Adding sickrooms, isolation rooms, bathhouses, hot water equipment, hot diaper pots, and disinfection equipment, totaling 300 yuan; (5) Adding an outdoor recreation hall, with equipment costs of 180 yuan, for a total cost of 1,000 yuan.</p>

The recent news of the bureau's work is recorded below for readers: (1) Dividing the province into scenic areas: The scenery in Zhejiang Province is natural and picturesque everywhere, and it has always been known as the "Switzerland of the East." Since the bureau's reorganization, it has become even more beautiful, and the number of tourists has increased sharply. For the convenience of management, the bureau has divided the province's scenic spots into seventeen scenic areas, namely West Lake, Linglong Mountain, Tianmu Mountain, Yandang Mountain, Tiantai Mountain, Qili Creek, Xuedou Mountain, Tiantong, Yuwang, Wuxie, Beishan, Xiandu, Fangyan, Nanming Mountain, Shimen Cave, Mogan Mountain, Putuo Mountain, and Yu Mausoleum; (2) Establishing Scenic Spot Management Offices: According to the above-mentioned scenic areas, a Scenic Spot Management Office is established in each area, all directly under the jurisdiction of the bureau to unify authority. Those that have been established include Tianmu Mountain and Qili Creek. The Xuedou Mountain management plan is under consideration. After being submitted to Chairman Chiang for approval, it can be established next spring. Other areas are also being planned and prepared; (3) Training qualified tour guides: China has no tour guides. Only Shanghai and Beiping have so-called "open-air guides" who are not adequately educated and have many bad habits, which greatly affect the international impression. The bureau created a tour guide training institute. The students' level is all above high school, and the training time is six months, with the first three months being classroom courses and the last three months being practical exercises. After the internship period is completed and qualified, official licenses are issued. The classroom courses have already been completed, and the qualified personnel have been assigned to various scenic areas for internships. Next spring, tourists visiting Zhejiang will have good guides; (4) Compiling Chinese and English guidebooks: Attracting Chinese and foreign tourists depends on effective publicity. Compiling and printing tourist guidebooks is an important task. Those that have been published include the scenic spots along the Hangzhou-Huizhou Road (including Linglong Mountain, Tianmu Mountain, Yuling Pass, etc.), Tiantai Mountain, Yandang Mountain, and the four scenic spots in eastern Zhejiang (Wuxie, Beishan, Xiandu, and Fangyan). There are eight types of tourist guidebooks in Chinese and English, and those currently being printed include West Lake, Qili Creek, and Xuedou Mountain. Other guidebooks are being written. These guidebooks all use three-color covers, with pictures and text, and the printing is very exquisite. The cost is high, and the expenses are large. Because there are too many requests and the postage is also expensive, a limited method has been set: each letter must be accompanied by five cents in postage; (5) Publishing transportation tour maps: The former Southeast Transportation Exhibition originally planned to publish this map, but it was not possible due to the short time. The bureau was originally responsible for handling the matters of the Southeast Transportation Exhibition, and it can be held next spring. This map is very important. The name of the map is "Southeast Transportation Tour Route Map," which has been published. All travel issues are covered. It is said that the China Travel Service, the two railway business offices, and the North Station information office in this city all sell it for two jiao each; (6) Adding an information office at Broken Bridge: The bureau's business is developing rapidly. Every day, there are dozens of inquiries by letter or in person. The bureau's address is in the Construction Department, which is inconvenient for tourists to contact. Therefore, the original site of the railway exhibition hall in front of Broken Bridge in West Lake has been renovated and transformed into a new information office, which is open day and night. A display window for local products of the province has also been set up to promote the trade of local products. The Shanghai Rotary Club travel group and the Guangdong team of the National Games sightseeing group were all planned by the bureau, and staff were sent to guide them. Everyone expressed satisfaction.</p>
<h3 id="e94">Yuantong Fish Company Announces Closure and Liquidation; Managers of Bankrupt Fish Companies Can Become Brokers at the Fish Market <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>The Guowen News reports that the business of Shanghai's fresh and salted fish companies has been poor in recent years, and the recent sluggish market has had a greater impact. Although this year's fish production is relatively small, the price has not risen as a result, and the fishing industry's economy is becoming increasingly panicked. The Yuantong Fish Company at 16th Pier in this city announced its closure and liquidation in this panic. The company's manager, Zhang Zhisheng, is a standing committee member of the Shanghai Salted Fish Association and has considerable experience in the fish industry, but he could not avoid closure and liquidation. Others can be imagined. According to people familiar with the fish industry, the fishing industry in this city has now entered a period of decline. During this period, the only way out for managers or employees of closed fish companies is to join the Ministry of Industry's fish market. Managers of bankrupt fish companies only need a deposit of 2,000 yuan to become brokers at the fish market, while operating a fish company alone requires no less than 20,000 to 30,000 yuan. Even for employees, the fish market is a government agency, and the salaries paid may not be lower than those of fish companies, so the living conditions can be relatively better. In the market, having people with fish industry experience to manage all affairs is also more convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e95">Vegetable Vendors on Kangti Road Form a Hunger Strike Group, Publishing a Plea for Fairness and Asking Mr. Du Yuesheng to Negotiate with the French Municipal Council <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>The vegetable stalls on Kangti Road in the French Concession have been banned by the French police, and despite repeated appeals, the issue has not been resolved. The vendors are extremely worried because their livelihoods have been cut off. Yesterday afternoon, they held an emergency meeting at the home of a representative in Xieqiao to discuss relief measures. The following resolutions were passed: (1) Send representatives to petition Mr. Du Yuesheng again, pleading for the hardship of the vendors who have run out of food, and asking him to negotiate with the French Municipal Council to withdraw the order and maintain a glimmer of hope; (2) Publish a plea for fairness, asking all sectors to advocate for fairness and provide united assistance; (3) Organize a hunger strike group; (4) Schedule a collective petition to the city's Party and government organs again, requesting a prompt solution to save the lives of the vendors and their families. The meeting adjourned after the resolutions were passed.</p>
<h3 id="e96">Beauty Hospital Shi Shuanghu Publicly Insults and Is Sentenced; Publicly Insulting Song Hongfu in the Newspaper; Trial Results in a Fine of Thirty Yuan <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Shi Shuanghu, who runs a beauty hospital, saw that his student, Song Hongfu from Fenghua, had independently established the Shanghai Beauty Hospital after graduating from medical school, which affected his business. He asked Song to return the graduation certificate he had given him, but Song refused. Shi then published a statement in the newspaper, saying that Song had been practicing medicine for less than half a year and had started his own business, treating human life like grass. Song immediately filed a criminal self-accusation against Shi for obstructing his reputation. Dai Rongduo, a judge of the First Special District Local Court, held a hearing and summoned Shi for questioning, but Shi evaded and did not appear. After reviewing the evidence submitted by the plaintiff, Judge Dai found that the defendant Shi Shuanghu had indeed publicly insulted the plaintiff and sentenced him to a fine of thirty yuan, which could be commuted to one day of labor for each yuan of the fine. The reasons for the judgment were roughly as follows: The plaintiff submitted a Shenbao newspaper from September 12 of this year, with an advertisement published by the defendant titled "Important Statement by Dr. Shi Shuanghu, Director of the Modern Science Beauty Hospital, Canceling the Graduation Certificate of Song Hongfu, Director of the Shanghai Beauty Hospital." The words in the advertisement had the intent of insulting the plaintiff, such as "Medical aspects are full of errors," and "Now Song Hongfu has been practicing medicine for less than half a year and has started his own business, treating human life like grass," and "Fortunately, I hope that all sectors will be aware and not be harmed by this quack doctor." The meaning is very clear. The plaintiff was indeed a student of the defendant, but the defendant gave him a graduation certificate, indicating that his medical skills had reached a considerable level. How could he insult the plaintiff with words such as "quack doctor," "full of errors," and "treating human life like grass" after the plaintiff started his own business and publish it in the newspaper, making it public to everyone? He should undoubtedly be held responsible for the crime of public insult. The defendant was legally summoned but did not appear in court, so the judgment was made without waiting for his statement.</p>
<h3 id="e97">Five Years Later, the Yong'an Yarn Factory Bribery Case Opens; Tan Huanxiang, a Person Involved in the Case, Surrenders in Shanghai; The Court Summons All Parties for Interrogation and Schedules a Judgment <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>In 1930, the Yong'an Yarn Factory in Wusong experienced a labor strike. The company, through Tan Huanxiang and Hong Dongyi, bribed Yan Gunian, Jin Fan, Wang Yunchang, and other members of the labor union executive committee to resign, causing the union to stop working and easing the labor strike. Later, Yan and others reported the bribery situation. As a result, they were not prosecuted because they were not civil servants. Subsequently, the High Court ordered a re-investigation, but Tan and Hong were on the run, and the case was suspended for five years. Now, the old matter is being brought up again. Tan Huanxiang has now returned to Shanghai and works as a senior employee at the Xiang Sheng Automobile Company in this city. Fearing that he would be discovered by the court, he filed a self-surrender with the local court and was ordered to pay a 500 yuan bail. Later, the bail was increased to 2,500 yuan. At 3:00 PM the day before yesterday, Judge Jun Qinzhi specially opened the Fifth Court for interrogation. First, Guo Shun, the general manager of the Yong'an Yarn Factory, arrived in court and testified. He was 51 years old, from Guangdong, and lived at 1400 Jing'an Temple Road. The judge said, "Your case has already been concluded. Today, you are being summoned to court to testify. You should tell the truth." Guo said, "Yes, yes." The judge asked, "How many years have you been managing the factory?" Guo replied, "More than ten years." The judge asked, "How many factories are there in total?" Guo replied, "Four factories. The second factory was established in 1921, formerly known as the Da Zhonghua Factory. Because of business failure, we took it over." The judge asked, "When was the union established?" Guo replied, "I don't know." The judge asked, "After the union was established, what did it do? Did the workers automatically confront the factory?" Guo replied, "Their union had no relationship with our factory." The judge asked, "Were Yan Gunian and Jin Fan union leaders?" Guo replied, "I don't know. I don't know Jin Fan, but Yan Gunian was a bookkeeper in the Wusong factory." The judge asked, "Do you have any ill feelings towards Yan Gunian?" Guo replied, "No." The judge asked, "Did your factory pay any money?" Guo replied, "No." The judge said, "You have already been declared innocent, and the judgment is final. You can tell the truth." Guo replied, "There really was no such thing." The judge said, "Then why did Yan Gunian say that you took out 3,000 yuan to dissolve the union?" Guo replied, "No." The judge asked, "After the Party dissolved the union, did the union re-establish itself?" Guo replied, "I don't know." At this point, Guo's lawyer stood up and said that Guo Shun's daily duties were extremely busy, and he requested permission to leave first. The judge approved it and ordered Guo Shun to sign and leave. Next, Tan Huanxiang testified that Hong Dongyi borrowed 3,000 yuan from him, saying that it was borrowed on behalf of a friend to open a sock factory. He borrowed it from Yan Gunian, Jin Fan, Wang Yunchang, and others because he had no money. The judge asked, "What is your relationship with Yan and others?" Tan replied, "Union relationship." The judge said, "That's not right. You previously testified that Hong Dongyi wanted to borrow money, and you borrowed it from relatives, stating that it would be returned by January 4. At the end of December, you asked Hong for it without success, so you borrowed it from Yan Gunian, etc." Tan replied, "Yes, it's like that. I later returned it in two installments, first 2,000 yuan and then 1,000 yuan." The judge asked, "Was Chen Hanjian the secretary of the union?" Tan replied, "Yes." The judge asked, "On December 7, 1929, did you order Chen Hanjian to persuade Yan Gunian to resign?" Tan replied, "No such thing." The judge asked, "Chen Hanjian's business was recommended by you. He certainly has no ill feelings towards you. Why would he say that about you?" Tan replied, "I don't know." At this point, Chen Hanjian's agent, lawyer Shen Yong, stood up and said that Chen Hanjian was working in Qingdao, so he did not arrive. The judge then invited Prosecutor Xie Lian to the court, gave a lecture, and finally the defendant's lawyer stood up and requested that the defendant be found innocent. The judge considered the end and scheduled the judgment to be pronounced at 2:00 PM on the 9th of this month. Tan Huanxiang was still released on his original bail.</p>

<h3 id="e98">Silver Dollar Exchange Rate Drops Again <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>In the local silver dollar exchange rate market, two weeks ago, each silver dollar could be exchanged for 3,420 copper coins, and silver coins could be exchanged for about 12.40 yuan. In the past two weeks, the copper coins have hovered around 3,345 yuan, and the silver coins have fluctuated between 12.20 and 12.30 yuan. Until the day before yesterday (Saturday), each silver dollar could still be exchanged for 3,300 copper coins, and silver coins could be exchanged for 12.20 yuan. Unexpectedly, yesterday morning, it suddenly fell sharply. Each silver dollar fell to 3,000 copper coins, and silver coins were only exchanged for 12.70 or 12.80 yuan. Therefore, the market was in great chaos for a while. The shops and stores arguing about the price of silver were heard everywhere.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Tea Shop Manager Secretly Sells Shop Base; Trial Begins; Proprietress, Still in Thin Clothing, Breaks Down in Tears; Manager Claims Justification for Closing the Shop—Court Postpones for Investigation and Further Examination of Witnesses— <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>Gong Bogao of Zhenjiang opened the Tianluchunji Tea and Food Shop at 449 Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, operating it for six years until his death on August 24th of last year. His wife, Gong Sun, continued the business, entrusting its management to Sun Maokun, an old shop assistant and fellow townsman. Mrs. Sun returned to her hometown on August 17th of this year to commemorate the anniversary of her late husband's death. Unexpectedly, the very next day, Sun Maokun, through a lawyer, published a statement accusing the proprietress of absconding with funds, declaring the shop liquidated, and offering it for sale. In early September, Mrs. Sun returned to Shanghai from her hometown and learned that the manager had secretly sold the shop, allegedly embezzling the proceeds and outstanding debts. She then engaged lawyers Fan Gang and Ma Lemon to file a suit in the Second Special Court's Criminal Division, accusing Sun Maokun of breach of trust and embezzlement. The court accepted the case and initially summoned the defendant, but he failed to appear, so a new hearing date was set. Previous reports have covered these details. The day before yesterday afternoon, Judge Li Changnian of the Second Special Court continued the trial in the Second Criminal Court. Plaintiff Gong Sun, accompanied by her lawyers, appeared and reiterated her previous statements, requesting the return of the shop base and the embezzled funds. She stated that all her clothes were in the shop and had been sealed off, and now that the weather was cold, she was still wearing thin clothing, breaking down in tears as she spoke. Defendant Sun Maokun, accompanied by his defense lawyer, testified that Mrs. Sun had left without saying goodbye on the morning of August 17th. He claimed that he had previously borrowed money and organized a cooperative to sustain the shop. After Mrs. Sun left, various creditors came to demand repayment of debts, and the shop employees also demanded their wages. He was forced to close the shop. Later, eight creditors, including Dayou Factory, entrusted lawyer Wang Chengmo to post a notice of liquidation and filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court. He sent his younger brother, Sun Xiaofu, to search for Mrs. Sun with creditors Huang Shuncai and a Mr. Gao, but they could not find her. He then sold the shop, and the proceeds were held by the lawyer, not yet delivered to the creditors, and so on. When questioned, plaintiff Gong Sun denied fleeing, stating that she had returned to her hometown to commemorate the anniversary of her late husband's death. The defendant's younger brother, Sun Xiaofu, had come to her house with a fellow townsman to arrange a marriage, but he had not mentioned the shop's liquidation or sale. Furthermore, her husband had operated the shop for six years, earning thousands of yuan annually without any losses, and she had a seventy-year-old mother-in-law and children relying on the shop for their livelihood. The court noted the conflicting testimonies and ordered an investigation of the case and the summoning of witnesses, adjourning the hearing to 2:00 PM on the ninth for further examination of witnesses.</p>

<h3 id="e110">Mixing Counterfeit Money and Offering Bribes for Release: Chen Guilin Detained Awaiting Sentence <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Chen Guilin from Jiangbei went to the Yanzhi paper store at 11799 Yangshupu Road the other day to try to pass a five-yuan counterfeit note from the Bank of China. The store owner, Mrs. Tang Huqin, caught him and called police officer 2250 who arrested him. Another five-yuan fake note from the Bank of Communications was found in his person. He was taken to the police station for detention, and the next morning, handed over to the First Special Court's Criminal Division Three. A lawyer for the Public Works Department, Zhang Shizhu, claimed that the defendant said in the police station that the counterfeit note had been given to him by a woman named Su Guiying who lived at 340 Rue Robert, to pay off a debt. Detectives had been sent to investigate, and while Su Guiying was confirmed to exist, she had moved a day before. A Chen Xiaosan claimed that he had never been given any such counterfeit money, and it was all a false accusation. Furthermore, after being arrested, the defendant had offered police officer 2250 one yuan in real money in an attempt to bribe his release. The eleven yuan in real and fake notes were submitted for examination. Chen Guilin's testimony was evasive. Judge Jiang Shuzi ordered him to be detained awaiting sentencing.</p>

<p>Zhuang Hongxing, a 21-year-old tailor from Haiyan, Zhejiang, checked into room No. 2 of the Minhe Small Hotel at 120 Rue Remi on the 1st of this month, paying the room fee. He then left and returned to the hotel to sleep at 8:00 PM. For some unknown reason, he committed suicide by swallowing raw opium. The next morning at 6:00 AM, the waiter entered the room to empty the chamber pot and saw nothing unusual. At 11:00 AM, the waiter urged him to get up, but there was no response. Only then did he discover that Zhuang had died in bed. He reported it to the Xuhui police station, which sent detectives to investigate. The body was taken to the Tongren Fuyuan mortuary. Yesterday was a holiday, and it will be reported to the Second Special Court today for an autopsy.</p>

<p>Publication of Allegorical Novel "The Extraordinary Adventures of a Beauty": The China Bookstore at 193 Aiwenyi Road, Datong Road, this port, after months of preparation, is scheduled to open today. It is said that the bookstore specializes in printing books beneficial to society and the country. The first publication is the allegorical novel and patriotic book "The Extraordinary Adventures of a Beauty." It is said that during Japan's time of poverty and weakness, amidst internal and external troubles, this book was fortunate to be published, and people from all walks of life eagerly read it and were deeply moved, which promoted the Meiji Restoration. Mr. Liang Qichao once said in his "Yinbingshi Wenji" that the reason for Japan's wealth and strength lies in "The Extraordinary Adventures of a Beauty." Thus, the potential and moving power of this book can be imagined. The content of this book mainly focuses on talented scholars and beauties, but all the narratives concern the rise and fall of countries in the world, their strengths and weaknesses, advantages and disadvantages, and their causes. It can awaken weak nations and make them aware of the difference between strength and demise, understand the principles of natural selection, and eliminate numb and bad mentalities, replacing them with conscience and responsibility. The bookstore believes that this book can indeed benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood, and after a long period of time, it has been translated into Chinese and is now published.</p>

<p>Mr. Zhou Zuoren's lecture on the New Literature Movement traces its origins to the Gong'an and Jingling schools of the late Ming Dynasty. Scholars across the country have been studying the literature of the late Ming Dynasty, and there have been new discoveries in the past two years. However, the literary works of the Gong'an and Jingling schools were banned and destroyed during the Qing Dynasty, and they are not widely circulated. Private collections are regarded as treasures and are not easy to obtain. The Shanghai Magazine Company is now publishing the "Rare Chinese Literature Series." In addition to Song Ci and Yuan Qu, the series emphasizes the late Ming Dynasty in terms of literary collections, and the poems and essays of the five masters of the Gong'an and Jingling schools—the three Yuan brothers, Zhong Xing, and Tan Yuanchun—are all included in the first collection. Yuan Xiaoxiu's diary has already been published and has been reprinted. Last week, the 8th issue specially published "The Collected Works of Tan Youxia," a master of the Jingling school, based on the original Ming Dynasty edition of twenty-three volumes, which has been completely copied and supplemented by Shen Qihou at the Beiping Library. It is truly a rare and precious literary collection.

<h3 id="e124">A Visit to the Free Farm <a href="#e124" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c124" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">124</a></h3>
<p>— Jinhua Ting</p>
<p>From Here You Can Understand the History and Quality of Milk</p>
<p>In recent years, milk has occupied a very large place among the foods in our country. Taking Shanghai as an example, whether it is Western restaurants, biscuit factories, or major hotels, clubs, and entertainment venues, they all use a large amount of milk every day. At the same time, ordinary families directly order milk from various milk companies, which probably accounts for more than 60% of the city's daily milk production of more than 30,000 pounds. From this point of view, the wide range of uses of milk is undisputed. However, most people only know that milk is a food rich in nutrients and beneficial to the body, but most people do not understand the whole process of milk production and the quality of milk. As for what kind of milk is called A-grade milk, what kind of milk is called B-grade milk, and what are the ingredients contained in milk, whether it is pure or not, what are the benefits of eating sterilized milk to the human body, and what are the harms of eating unsterilized milk to the human body, because there are already many milk factories in Shanghai, among which many meet the inspection regulations of the Public Works Department and the Municipal Health Bureau, but there are also quite a few that do not meet the inspection regulations or even have not been inspected. If you are not careful and eat inferior milk, it is not only useless but also harmful. Because of this reason, the reporter made a special trip to the Free Farm, which has a good reputation and the best performance, for an inspection. Now I will record the various situations obtained from the inspection in detail below.</p>
<p>A Tour of the Whole Farm</p>
<p>Our group of seven people arrived at the Free Farm on Kang Nao Tu Road at 3:30 PM that afternoon. Mr. You Huaihao, the head of the farm, and Mr. Shen Guotang, the director of the "Family Service Society" founded by the farm, received us very warmly. For the sake of easy understanding and saving time, we first took a tour of the whole farm.</p>
<p>1. Cow Shed: The entire shed has 120 dairy cows. The farm is rectangular in shape. The middle is the aisle. On the left and right sides of the aisle, there are four rows of iron fences. Each grid tethers a cow. Although these cows are tethered in each grid, they can still move forward and backward freely. The two sides are feeding lanes. Feeding is done three times a day, at 7:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 10:00 PM. Milking is done at the same time as feeding, so milking is also done three times a day. The cow workers are divided into groups of six, with four skilled workers and two assistants in each group, managing a total of 40 dairy cows. Another person specializes in measuring the temperature of the cows and checking for diseases, and another person specializes in managing the feed. The entire shed is supervised by a foreman to supervise and manage the workers. Mr. You said that the construction of the cow shed has certain dimensions. The most important thing is that the entire site should be three inches higher than the street surface outside the farm, and the cow shed should be six inches higher than the entire site, so that all the water can flow out easily and not accumulate. The total width of the cow shed is 34 feet. Other dimensions, such as the cow stalls, aisles, feeding lanes, and waterways, all have certain dimensions. Windows and doors are used on both sides of the shed and on the roof to allow air circulation and bright light. There are many types of dairy cows in the world, but the following four types are the best in terms of production and nutrients.</p>
<p>(A) Holstein Cattle: Holstein cattle have the longest history among dairy cows. They have been spread in Europe for a thousand years. The place of origin is Holland. Now, milk farms in Belgium, Holland, Germany, the United States, and other countries all have their traces. Their bodies are black and white, and they are very large. The average weight is about 1,300 pounds, and some are 1,500 to 1,700 pounds. They are very docile. The milk production is higher than any other type of dairy cow, but the fat content is very low, and the oil globules are also small, making oil extraction more difficult. However, they have a lot of protein, making them the best for feeding children.</p>
<p>(B) Jersey Cattle: According to research, Jersey dairy cows originated in Switzerland and are an excellent representative of dairy cows in southern Europe. These cows are now found all over the world. Each one weighs about 900 pounds, and males weigh 1,300 to 700 pounds. They are very docile. The milk they produce usually contains 5.5% fat, and sometimes even 6% to 7%. One pound of butter can be extracted from 16 to 19 pounds of milk, and the oil globules are very large, making oil extraction easier. These cows are considered the most refined among dairy cows.</p>
<p>(C) Guernsey Cattle: Guernsey cattle were brought from Guernsey Island in Holland. In the past, they were only used by nobles in Europe, so they were not very popular. Now, there are very many Guernsey cattle farms in the United States. Guernsey cattle are plumper than Jersey cattle, weighing about 1,050 pounds to 1,250 pounds. They are very cold-resistant and very intelligent. Their milk production is more than Jersey, but the butter content is not as high as Jersey. These cows can produce 6,000 to 9,000 pounds of milk per year.</p>
<p>(D) Ayrshire Cattle: Ayrshire dairy cows have the best appearance, but they are the youngest in the history of selection. In the 18th century, some farmers in Ayrshire, Scotland, disliked them for being too small and thin, and their milk production was also low. They transported some other breeds from the Netherlands to mix, and as a result, they selected Ayrshire dairy cows. The dairy cows weigh about 1,000 pounds, and the male cows weigh about 1,500 pounds. Because they were improved from wild species, and the years are not many, they are very temperamental, so they are difficult to serve. These cows are currently still undergoing precise selection and improvement, so the milk production is not as much as other types.</p>
<p>The Free Farm has three types of dairy cows: the first type is Holstein, the second type is Jersey, and the third type is non-purebred. According to Mr. You, these three types of dairy cows are all foreign breeds, some bought from the United States, some bought from Canada, and some grown locally. The purchase price of each cow is about 500 to 700 yuan (national currency). Among the three types of dairy cows, Holstein has the highest production, and Jersey has the most fat. The total production of the entire farm is 1,600 to 1,800 pounds per day in winter and spring, and 1,000 to 1,200 pounds per day in summer and autumn.</p>
<p>2. Bottle Washing Department: After passing through the refrigeration department from the cow shed, we turned to the bottle washing department. Bottle washing is a very important part of the work in a milk factory. All used milk bottles must be washed three times and go through four steps. The first step is to wash away the oily dirt, the second step is to put the bottles on the machine to wipe off the oil stains inside and outside, the third step is to wash them clean, and the fourth step is to send the washed milk bottles to the steam room and cook them at a temperature of 200 degrees Fahrenheit for 15 minutes, and then send them to the bottle filling department next door. In addition, the large and small lead buckets used to hold milk must also be washed and boiled in the same way, and these lead buckets are all made of original lead quality and have no seams to prevent other dirty things from entering.</p>
<p>3. Sterilization Department: Finally, we arrived at the sterilization department. The work in this department is the most important. There is a milk boiling pot in the center. In front of the pot, there is a cooling milk machine with different gears. After the milk is squeezed from the dairy cows, it is transported to the sterilization room in the above-mentioned lead buckets and poured into the milk pot to let it boil. It is most suitable to cook it to 145 degrees Fahrenheit, and at most to 148.5 degrees. The time is 30 minutes. If it does not reach this temperature, the "E. coli" in the milk cannot be completely eliminated. If it exceeds this temperature, the "vitamin," also known as "vitamin," in the half-milk will be affected, and the nutritional content of this milk will be reduced. Therefore, an "automatic recording thermometer" must be set up in this room. Each day, an automatic recording form is used to indicate whether the milk has been heated to 145 degrees and whether it has been heated for 30 minutes. The milk is transferred from the sterilizer to the cooling milk machine using a pump. The cooling milk machine is flat, so that when the milk passes through the tube, it is successful in a very thin range. The milk is cooled to 45 degrees, and then the milk is poured into bottles using a bottling machine and sealed by hand. Because the sealing is done by machine, the worker's fingers absolutely cannot come into contact with the milk. Finally, it is sent to the cold storage room to gradually lower the temperature of the milk, so that the milk microorganisms in the milk will not develop and survive. Elimination of Inferior Milk: The milk industry has made great progress in recent years, which should be attributed to the Public Works Department, because without its promotion and advancement, it would probably not be possible to obtain this good milk today, because eight years ago the milk industry was extremely immature, and today's milk industry has become a scientific milk industry.</p>
<p>2. The Difference Between "A" Grade Milk and "B" Grade Milk: In terms of the ingredients of milk, A grade and B grade are the same. The difference lies entirely in the issue of pure hygiene. Therefore, A grade milk, first, must have complete sanitary equipment; second, it must have technically astute management talent and well-trained work assistants; and third, it must have the close supervision and guidance of the competent authority. All three are indispensable, because without equipment, it is impossible to produce qualified A grade milk. For example, with steam equipment, it is possible to sterilize the milk itself and the utensils and equipment that come into contact with the milk. With refrigeration equipment, the bacteria in the milk can be prevented from developing and fermenting and spoiling. But with equipment, without the corresponding technical talent to use it, this equipment is also useless. But with equipment and talent, without the so-called competent authority to supervise and inspect, it is also useless, because bacteria are invisible to the naked eye and must be known after a chemical test of the milk's content. This is the most important part of the work. After inspection, the qualification of A grade milk can be determined. Therefore, A grade milk has been medically tested by the competent authority, and B grade milk has not been tested. So A grade milk can be drunk cold, and B grade milk is not safe to drink cold.</p>
<p>3. Three Different Inspection Works</p>
<p>A. Inspection of Milk Farms: To make milk popular and sold in Shanghai, it is necessary to obtain a license from the three health bureaus. The Public Concession Health Department has 30 rules, the disinfection rules have 9 articles, and the Municipal Health Bureau and the French Concession Health Bureau each have 19 articles. All matters concerning the cleanliness of the environment and dairy cows, the construction of houses, the smoothness of ditches, the equipment of machines, whether the work is legal, whether the water is safe, and the health of the workers are included. Approximately for historical reasons, the Public Concession Health Department is in the leading position, and most of the work is handled by the Health Department. Health workers often work day and night and are responsible for this inspection work, but in the near future, it is feared that the milk companies in the Chinese area will be fully inspected by the Municipal Health Bureau. It is heard that one or two milk or goat milk companies, which were previously managed by the Health Department, have now abandoned this responsibility and are now under the Municipal Health Bureau.</p>
<p>Expert Talks</p>
<p>After we finished the tour of the whole farm, we returned to the reception room. They politely prepared milk, black tea, and various delicacies, as well as their own milk cakes, which were very delicious. After we had tea and snacks, Mr. You began to talk about the technical aspects of milk.</p>
<p>1. Types of Milk Grading in Shanghai: Although milk in Shanghai is divided into A and B grades, there are four different types: one is A grade sterilized, the second is B grade unsterilized, the third is A grade unsterilized, and the fourth is B grade unsterilized. This grading method has only been implemented for eight years and was formulated by the Health Department of the Public Works Department. It is a policy to encourage the improvement of the milk industry, so that the superior can survive,</p>
<p>(B) Inspection of Dairy Cows: There are two types of dairy cow inspections: one is a regular general inspection, and the other is a tuberculosis inspection, both of which are handled by the Public Concession Health Department and do not charge any fees. Dairy cows of A grade milk companies are inspected once every three months, and dairy cows of B grade milk companies are inspected once every six months. If tuberculosis is found in the Shanghai dairy cows, the dairy cow will be ordered to be slaughtered without any leniency, because tuberculosis in the lungs is not easy to spread, while tuberculosis in the mammary glands will be transmitted to the milk. Tuberculosis was not inspected before. Since 1928, because Dr. Wang Zhaoqi, a veterinarian from the Shanghai Municipal Government Health Bureau, wanted to handle the inspection procedures, the Public Works Department hired Dr. Shu Shubei, a veterinarian who studied at Cornell University, to implement the inspection of dairy cows without charging any fees. Since then, Shanghai's milk industry has greatly improved, but the results after the inspection were shocking. It was only then that it was known that 50% to 80% of the dairy cows in Shanghai had tuberculosis. To remedy this shortcoming, on the one hand, efforts were made to gradually reduce the number of tuberculosis cows, and on the other hand, all the milk was sterilized, because there was no problem after sterilization. Therefore, regarding B grade milk, the Public Works Department initiated the joint organization of a central milk sterilization plant last year, in order to sterilize all B grade milk to ensure the safety of citizens drinking milk. Later, due to various reasons, it did not succeed. The Public Works Department, in order to consistently implement its proposition that milk must be sterilized, re-stipulated that all B grade milk in Shanghai must be sterilized by June 30, 1936, otherwise they will be ordered to stop business. This is the situation in the British Concession. The Chinese and French Concessions are also conducting inspection work at the same time.</p>
<p>(C) Inspection of Milk: There are also two different inspections of milk: (1) inspection of ingredients. It is of course true that the milk does not contain E. coli and will not cause illness, but whether it has obtained the nourishment of milk is still a problem. In relatively advanced cities in Shanghai, there are of course health authorities who send personnel to inspect whether the milk farms are legal and whether the milk meets the regulations. Under such circumstances, there is of course no need to worry. But look at the current domestic situation, how many places have established health authorities to manage these things, then we pay the price and order milk, and we should also know whether it is reliable or not, and whether it is hygienic or not. To understand these questions, we must first clarify the original ingredients of milk, and then see if there will be chemical changes after adding other things. Milk contains four major elements, and its composition is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Water accounts for about 88%</p>
<p>(2) Fat (i.e. butter) accounts for about 4%</p>
<p>(3) Protein, etc. accounts for about 8%</p>
<p>(4) Minerals or carbonaceous matter accounts for about 0.9%</p>
<p>Under the management of the Public Works Department Health Department, the layer of water is not a problem, so what should be paid attention to when drinking milk is a kind of microorganism invisible to the naked eye. As for the ordinary use of a milk meter to measure the ingredients of milk, it must be accurate when the milk temperature is 60 degrees, otherwise the milk temperature will be too high, and the milk meter will float. Two, is the inspection of bacteria, there are two kinds of bacteria to be inspected in milk, the first is milk bacteria, it is stipulated that each CC should not exceed the ordinary reading of ten thousand, (this is the A grade non-sterilized milk regulation) after sterilization, each CC should not exceed 30,000, (this is the A grade sterilized milk regulation) the second kind is fecal bacteria, that is, standard bacteria, also known as E. coli, it is used to measure the existence of various germs, it is stipulated that this bacteria cannot be found in one tenth CC, if it is found, the Public Works Department will issue a standard warning letter for the first time, and at the same time order an investigation and improvement, if the root cause is not immediately investigated and intentionally committed several times, the Public Works Department has the right to temporarily cancel the A grade milk license, if the milk is adulterated with water, the Public Works Department will file a public prosecution and punish it, if it is not improved and often violates regulations, the license will be revoked and the business will be stopped,</p>
<p>Because pulmonary tuberculosis dairy cows cannot be eliminated, there is a danger of spreading the disease in contact with the air, so the benefits of sterilization and the harms of non-sterilization are obvious. Then the quality of milk is not entirely in the concentration of the quality, because under the management of the Public Works Department, the problem of adulteration with water has become a thing of the past and will never happen, and the invisible bacteria in milk that make people sick are a very big problem, so to make milk pure, safe, and hygienic, it is a product of the combination of equipment, talent, and inspection, and one is indispensable.

<p>Shanghai Branch of the Educational Film Association Revises the Method of Rotating Educational Films – Twice per School per Semester, Six Reels Each Time – Has Been Approved by the Municipal Education Bureau for Implementation</p>
<p>The Shanghai Branch of the China Educational Film Association has been praised by various schools since it was approved by the Ministry of Education to rotate educational films in schools at all levels in this city. There are currently a total of 152 schools in this city that charge low fees. It was originally planned to show films three times per school per semester, with four reels per show. With one set of projectors rotating, showing four schools per day, it would take about one and a half months to show all 152 schools per week, excluding Sundays. It was also often inconvenient due to temporary events at schools that changed the time, which would inevitably affect other schools. Therefore, a new method has been formulated, changing the showing to once per school per semester, with six reels per show. This has been approved by the Education Bureau for implementation. The revised method is as follows: (1) In order to avoid errors in mailing, the Shanghai Branch will post the schedule of school names and times for the next week (Monday to Sunday) in the newspaper's public announcement column every Saturday, starting from October 4, 1935, without separate notification. (2) If a school with a scheduled showing needs to change the showing time, it can cut out the school exchange time change notification form attached to the newspaper within two days from the date of publication, fill it out clearly, and send it to the association. The association will reallocate it according to the situation and notify the school. (3) If the Shanghai Branch's staff arrives at the school on time for the showing, but the school does not show the film, it will be considered as having been shown. This does not apply to outdoor showings that cannot be held due to rain. (4) Each time the Shanghai Branch's staff arrives at the school to show the film, they will bring a consultation form to be filled out and stamped by the school for future reference. (5) Starting from the second semester of 1935, the Shanghai Branch will send the names of the films and their descriptions to each school for students to announce before each rotation week. (6) If a school needs to prepare a black cloth, it must send someone to the association to pick it up before the showing and return it immediately after the showing to avoid affecting other schools' borrowing.</p>

<p>Little Men (84) – Originally Written by American Author Louisa May Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>These fine qualities made that "Little Scatterbrain" (which was the nickname they gave her) well-regarded by each and every one of them. Little May no longer felt bored and complained because Nan On would ingeniously come up with the most enjoyable games, and her pranks were comparable to Machiavelli's, leaving the entire school feeling refreshed and elated. She buried her doll in the ground and dug it up a week later, only to find that it had become moldy. May felt extremely regretful, but Nan On suddenly remembered that there was a painter in the house, so she took the doll to him and asked him to paint it crimson. The two large eyes were jet black, and then she dressed it in red boots, adorned it with feathers, and equipped it with Neda's lead axe. This made it look like a Native American chieftain. Thus, "King Bopeedila" wielded his axe and hammer, making devastating attacks, and the other dolls were all in danger. For a time, the nursery was shrouded in terror, with a bloody scene unfolding. She gave her new shoes to a little beggar, hoping that she could stomp her feet like this, but later realized that such charity could not coexist with physical comfort and received a warning that she could not dispose of her clothes at will without permission in the future. She used a piece of wood to make a fire ship, fitted with two large sails, which were covered with turpentine. When it was getting dark, she lit the sails and sent the little boat downstream. The children on the shore clapped and cheered. She drove that old male turkey in front of the hay wagon, urging it to run quickly as if it were a whirlwind. She saw four distressed cats being abused by some heartless children and could not bear to see them suffer, so she took off her coral necklace and exchanged it for them. The wind and sun nurtured them like a loving mother, applying cold cream to their wounds and feeding them with a baby's bottle. Later, they finally died, and she grieved deeply until Xiao Qiao gave her one of his best turtles, which gradually eased her grief. She wanted Lai Siwu to tattoo an anchor on her arm, like all of his, and later went further, begging him to tattoo a blue star on each of her cheeks, but he finally dared not agree to this request. Although she first asked with sweet words, and then threatened with dangerous words, even the soft-hearted old servant was almost ready to submit to her request. She had ridden all the animals in this garden, from the large horse "Enqin" to that inferior pig. She almost fell off the pig once, but managed to save herself. Whatever the boys provoked her to do, she would do it immediately, no matter how dangerous the thing was, and the boys had endless ways to test her courage. He never got tired of it.</p>

<p>Economic Supplement: The Inside Story of the Soaring Gold Price and Its Causes and Consequences by Zhang Yifan</p>
<p>"1"</p>
<p>The monetary system that is stuck in the metal standard rut attempts to establish a permanent and unchanging measure of value, or at least a relatively stable one. The slim hope for this and the minimal possibility have long been proven by the fact that precious metal prices rise and fall drastically.</p>
<p>If people are used to using gold, and therefore must try to create a new currency that can truly serve as a measure of value based on this habit, this situation is really like a person who is stuck in a muddy puddle. Instead of thinking about climbing ashore (jumping ashore is actually impossible, so one can only think about climbing ashore), he struggles hard in the same place, trying to extricate himself. As a result, there is no other harvest to hope for except for going further and further down and dying.</p>
<p>Isn't that so? The trend of high gold prices and low silver prices was only like the day before yesterday. And today's trend of high silver prices and low gold prices is about to become yesterday's event. The current sharp drop in China's exchange rate and the surge in gold prices in Shanghai are descending like a storm.</p>
<p>During the period of high gold prices and low silver prices, everyone deeply felt the soaring prices at that time, the increasing burden of life, the high prices of various advanced means of production, and the great losses in international balance of payments. Therefore, they strongly advocated banning the export of gold, or advocated gradually adopting the gold standard system. They all agreed that only in this way could modern production technology be used to revitalize domestic industries as much as possible, reduce the people's burden of living to enrich the society and the country, and at the same time, avoid this kind of unwarranted loss in international balance of payments.</p>
<p>Although this plan was not realized, it was actually fortunate that it was not realized. However, the hope for a renewed collapse in gold prices was immediately realized after only a short two years. However, because this time the drop in gold prices was excessive and the rise in silver prices was too great, domestic silver was exported one after another, and financial panic broke out in various places as credit tightened sharply. At the same time, prices fell in the opposite direction, and nine out of ten producers suffered losses. Therefore, the whole country was alarmed, and they strongly advocated banning the export of silver, devaluing the currency, and proposing various countermeasures that lingered on the metal standard. Some have in fact been realized, and some are in fact preparing to be realized. At this time, everyone thought that only in this way could prices rise and industries be maintained. Therefore, looking back, they not only no longer felt the harm of the trend of high gold prices and low silver prices in the twentieth year of the Republic, but almost unanimously believed that only low silver prices and high gold prices "can enable China to avoid the economic panic that has spread around the world," and even pointed out that the time was "a period of prosperity for China."</p>
<p>This contradictory feeling phenomenon can be said to be due to the fact that China's currency does not have a central policy, or that it is only caused by each person planning for his own subjective interests.</p>
<p>The group of people who are dissatisfied with high gold prices and low silver prices are mainly the comprador class, the fashionable friends, and the institutions with heavy foreign debts, because high gold prices and low silver prices lead to a sharp drop in foreign exchange rates, and the price of imported goods rises sharply, which greatly hits the comprador business. Therefore, ordinary fashionable friends cannot fully enjoy "modern material civilization." At the same time, repaying foreign debts requires spending more silver coins to meet the debts settled in gold prices, so they deeply feel the panic of insufficient income and expenditure.</p>
<p>However, when the opposite situation of high silver prices and low gold prices arrives, the people who are dissatisfied with this change to another group of people, mainly the gold sub-capital and industrial capital, and financial capital among silver standard countries. The main thing that represents their wealth is the price of silver. As a rule, expensive silver prices increase their wealth and invisibly increase their profits. But the pity is that most of the domestic silver is in the hands of foreign banks in China. Seeing that the overseas silver price is higher than that in China, for their own interests, they will inevitably transport the cash for export to seek the difference. Once the momentum of cash outflow is great, the domestic currency will suddenly tighten, and then the credit in various places will be extremely tight, and the industries will be declared bankrupt, and the national financial capital will suffer a double blow. The first is the threat of inflation, fearing that once inflation occurs, foreign banks will take the opportunity to oppress Chinese banks; the second is the impact of industrial bankruptcy, making it impossible for them to recover the principal and interest of the loans they have issued. Industrial capital suffers even greater blows; first, the soaring exchange rate causes import prices to be low and export prices to rise, which strengthens the economic pressure of international capitalists; second, the domestic wholesale price calculated in silver falls relatively, which reduces his profits and also risks losing his costs. Third, cash outflows in various places and tight credit lead to short-term chips and make it difficult to make further development plans, and even maintaining the status quo is worrying!</p>
<p>However, the majority of agricultural producers and the working masses, who account for the largest proportion of the total national population, suffer unwarranted disasters regardless of whether gold prices are high and silver prices are low or silver prices are high and gold prices are low. During the period of high gold prices and low silver prices, the collapse of export prices of agricultural products invisibly reduced his income; with the rising trend of domestic prices, agricultural products were slower than industrial products, and this scissor gap aggravated his pain in income and expenditure. Under the opposite phenomenon of high silver prices and low gold prices, in addition to the tariff barriers of various countries, devaluation and dumping are also implemented, and the state bears the responsibility for its losses. Therefore, the agricultural products in my country, which have increased export prices, have lost a corner of the overseas surplus market and are running into walls everywhere. At the same time, the collapse of domestic prices, the decline of agricultural products is more violent than that of industrial products, so the impact on farmers is more severe than others. Recently, there have been many great theories and famous works explaining that the economic panic in China today is due to the soaring and plummeting of silver prices, although it is inevitable to obliterate other causes, it cannot be denied the importance of its relationship.</p>
<p>As for the working masses, salaried classes, and self-employed people in cities, they have not felt the personal pain of "rice is as precious as pearls, firewood is as expensive as cinnamon, and life is difficult" in the situation of high gold prices and low silver prices. Because at that time, prices were raised, but the income of wages and salaries still stood still at a low level. On the contrary, in the situation of high silver prices and low gold prices, the burden of life is relatively reduced, but the real wage is also reduced at the same time. In particular, the bankruptcy of industries makes it impossible for them to maintain their livelihood occupations, and they join the ranks of the unemployed, so even if prices fall, it still has nothing to do with them.</p>
<p>Taking a step back, no matter whether gold prices are high and silver prices are low, or silver prices are low and gold prices are high, it can always give a considerable benefit to some people. But the pity is that the fate of this benefit is controlled by the hands of others, we can only float and sink with others, and be arranged by others. Looking at the current national horror under the high silver prices and low gold prices, in just the most recent week, the Shanghai gold standard and foreign exchange market prices have reversed the past phenomenon. Yesterday (October 30) the Shanghai gold standard market price has opened up the highest price that has never existed since ancient times, and each tael is worth as much as 1,183 yuan. Compared with the previous 1,000 yuan or so before the United States implemented the silver purchase policy, it is not the same, and it is</p>

<p>(Chlorine Water) Wash your hands once in it. A basin of chlorine water is placed at the entrance of the delivery room. In two years, the mortality rate of women in the first delivery room dropped from four hundred and fifty-nine to forty-five. Then, Ignaz's invention would probably be warmly welcomed. On the contrary, the professors of obstetrics at that time regarded his opinions as heresy. They said, "What? Is puerperal fever caused by our own hands as doctors? Absurd! Irrelevant!" In their minds, childbirth is naturally dangerous, and puerperal fever is an unavoidable disease. They regarded Ignaz's theory as detrimental to the reputation of obstetricians, so they tried their best to oppose and attack him. However, Ignaz continued to work hard to promote his theory, publish papers, and persuade people he met. The public's indifference and his own eagerness forced him to go mad; this young medical revolutionist later died in an asylum.</p>
<p>Amidst the opposition to Ignaz, there were also a few doctors who agreed with his claims. Professor Michaelis of Kiel was one of them. Michaelis had personally delivered his niece, but unfortunately, she died of puerperal fever. After hearing about Ignaz's invention, Michaelis concluded that he himself had killed his niece. To express his regret and sincerity, he committed suicide under a train. Common Sense of Ear, Nose, Throat, and Eye Hygiene Tang Renjin (69) (Continued)</p>
<p>(4) Parasitic Stomatitis</p>
<p>Parasitic stomatitis is also known as thrush. It is caused by the transmission of a kind of thrush bacteria. Part of this bacteria is filamentous. Part of it is composed of circular spores. Its transmission route can be transmitted to the oral cavity through the medium of air, or it can parasitize on the feeding bottle and invade the mouth of the infant. This bacteria can especially develop and proliferate in the case of unclean oral cavity, decomposition of milk remaining in the oral cavity, dryness, and inflammation. Infants are most likely to develop this disease (most common in infants one or two weeks after birth). In adults, it often occurs in patients with severe typhoid fever, pulmonary tuberculosis, cancer, diabetes, and other debilitating conditions.</p>
<p>The main symptoms of thrush are redness, swelling, and white patches on the mucous membrane of the tongue, cheeks, and soft palate. The white patches are initially small, then gradually enlarge. The inner surface of the oral cavity appears white, like snow, so it is commonly called "snow mouth." In the early stage, it can be easily peeled off, but in the later stage, it is often fixed and appears yellowish or reddish-brown. Sometimes the white patches can even spread to the pharynx, throat, and esophagus. Saliva secretion is mostly vigorous. Infants often feel inconvenience and pain when breastfeeding, which often causes crying. Sometimes there are also symptoms such as diarrhea and emaciation. Adults also often complain of pain when chewing and swallowing. The course of this disease is about one to two weeks. Its treatment should first focus on oral hygiene. Before and after breastfeeding, infants should use 2% boric acid solution to clean the oral cavity at all times. At the same time, the mother's nipples and feeding bottles should also be kept clean. If white patches have already appeared in the oral cavity, use a medicated solution that inhibits the growth of bacteria to apply or gargle.</p>
<p>(5) Gangrenous Stomatitis</p>
<p>Gangrenous stomatitis is also known as water cancer. It is one of the most dangerous types of stomatitis. It is more common in children with weak constitutions. Its predisposing factors can be divided into two types: internal and external. External factors include poverty, malnutrition, and lack of cleanliness. Internal factors include infectious diseases such as measles, scarlet fever, pertussis, smallpox, intermittent fever, pneumonia, dysentery, tuberculosis, syphilis, and systemic diseases such as Meleney's ulcer, hemorrhagic diathesis, etc. Clinically, it is more common to occur secondary to measles.</p>
<p>The main symptom of this disease is the appearance of blisters on the mucous membrane of the cheeks (near the corners of the mouth), followed by ulcers. Its putrid odor is offensive. The spread from the lesion to the surface and deep tissues is very rapid. Therefore, in just a few days, the infiltration can reach the outside of the cheeks, and the ulcer breaks through to the outside, exposing the bone, which soon dies. Therefore, the appearance of this disease is indeed cheek gangrene. At the same time, the affected side of the face also develops collateral edema. The nearby lymph nodes also become swollen. Furthermore, this disease often causes high fever, often reaching around 40 degrees Celsius. The consumption of physical strength is also very rapid. Patients feel local pain. Saliva secretion is also vigorous and mixed with purulent blood.</p>
<p>The prognosis of this disease is very poor. It is more likely to be fatal than to recover. Its mortality rate is about three-quarters. The cause of death may be sudden collapse or weakness after the illness. The treatment method is to use cauterization or corrosion to prevent the spread of the lesion. On the one hand, pay attention to the patient's nutrition and try to maintain his physical strength, but in most cases, death is inevitable. A Brief Discussion on Pulmonary Tuberculosis (73) Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Section 3 Mental Cultivation of the Patient</p>
<p>Regarding dietary taboos as a treatment method, a considerable number of people have advocated it recently; they believe that reducing the amount of chlorine伊洪 in the body has the effect of accelerating the formation of connective tissue. Their argument is: restrict the patient's salt intake. If there is a loss of appetite, other spices or meat juices can be used as substitutes; meat should also be limited, water intake should be reduced, and fat intake can be increased. Fresh vegetables and fruits can also be increased in large quantities. This treatment method has the best results for skin tuberculosis and also provides some assistance for pulmonary tuberculosis; however, there is still no conclusion as to which stage or type is most suitable, and this can only be corrected by those who come later!</p>
<p>The importance of quiet rest in the treatment of this disease has already been discussed above: but relying solely on this kind of physical quietness is sometimes not enough, so whether the patient's mental state is quiet or not is also a major issue in treatment and is worth emphasizing. We must understand that the emotions of pulmonary tuberculosis patients are mostly excessively sensitive; even if he closes his eyes and lies down all day, his mental activities will not stop. He pays close attention to the details of his daily symptoms: such as the presence or absence of cough, the level of body temperature, the presence or absence of tubercle bacilli in the sputum, and the goodness or badness of appetite, etc., without being bothered by the trivialities. Therefore, although the body is quiet, the mind is not quiet, which is of course harmful and not beneficial to the progress of the disease. If the symptoms show slight changes, such as a higher temperature or a poor appetite; sometimes these are just temporary gains and losses and have nothing to do with the overall situation, but the patient feels depressed and inexplicably upset, thinking that the disease has deteriorated! Even if the doctor tries his best to comfort him, he cannot relieve the depression in his heart. As a result, he falls into severe neurasthenia, and the patient's self-confidence and courage are lost. Often, diseases that can be cured end up being unmanageable: truly, "a trickle not stopped will eventually become a river!"</p>

<p>(Question 43) What is the function of dental pulp?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are two functions: (1) To produce and nourish the dentin. If the dentin is damaged, it will regenerate a layer of dentin to protect itself, which is called secondary dentin. (2) It is rich in sensation and can respond to external stimuli such as cold, heat, chemical, or mechanical stimulation.</p>
<p>(Question 44) How does the dental pulp sense external stimuli? What are the benefits of this response?</p>
<p>(Answer) Its response is pain. For example, if we eat something too cold, too hot, or too sour, our teeth will feel sore and painful. Or if the teeth are hit by a car or the cavity reaches a deep part, we will also feel pain. The expression of toothache is a warning of impending harm, so that we can find a way to stop it early, so as not to suffer too much damage and be unable to save it in time.</p>
<p>(Question 45) What is the difference between a tooth without pulp and a tooth with intact pulp?</p>
<p>(Answer) The dental pulp is originally a living cell, and the dentin is nourished by it and is also alive. If the dental pulp has a problem and dies, or is extracted! The dentin loses its nourishment and is also dead. At this time, the tooth becomes a dead tooth. Medical treatment to stop tooth pain (39) Li Xing</p>
<p>Amnesia drugs</p>
<p>Scientific advancement is the vanguard of medicine. In the mid-19th century, various scientific developments sprung up like mushrooms after rain. Medical scientists also took the opportunity to use new scientific knowledge to promote and develop medicine, so the inventions in medicine also had the momentum of advancing a thousand miles a day. The most glorious discovery on a page in the history of scientific medicine is the practical application of amnesia drugs. The discovery of amnesia drugs has also opened up a bright road for surgery. Its contribution to mankind is indeed not insignificant. This kind of invention is really worth commemorating, and the process of its discovery is also very interesting.</p>
<p>In 1799, an Englishman named Davy published the amnesic properties of nitrous oxide (i.e., laughing gas) and suggested using nitrous oxide to induce amnesia in patients undergoing surgery. When nitrous oxide is inhaled into the body, the inhaler loses consciousness in an instant, and when he wakes up, he laughs wildly, hence the name laughing gas. Anyone who has studied chemistry a little probably knows this effect of laughing gas. However, scientists are full of research spirit, and Davy wanted to use this gas to induce amnesia in inhalers to eliminate pain. At that time, it was a groundbreaking proposal. Because he was not a doctor, it was not put into practical use. However, this was the prelude to the discovery of amnesia drugs. It was not until 1842 that Dr. Long of Georgia, USA, first used it to induce amnesia in surgical patients.</p>
<p>In December 1844, an American dentist named Wells in Connecticut saw a person lose the sensation of pain after inhaling laughing gas during a lecture and performance. Based on this hint, the next day he used laughing gas to induce amnesia in a patient and then extracted his tooth. After the person woke up, he had no pain at all. This was Wells's great success. Laughing gas then entered the practical application stage. He also immediately wrote books and made great claims about his own talents, forgetting to drink water and think of the source, completely burying the merits of others. Although later commentators did not publicly recognize him as the discoverer of laughing gas, they also recognized his contribution to introducing laughing gas into practical use. Unfortunately, in 1845, the public performance in Boston did not go well and was criticized by the public. At the same time, Morton's performance of inducing amnesia was successful, causing laughing gas to be rejected for many years. Since the failure of his public performance and being ridiculed, Wells became depressed and eventually went mad and committed suicide. Wells's tragic death can also be regarded as a sacrifice for scientific medicine and for the happiness of mankind. This shows that the invention of science is not accidental. Years later, in 1863, Colton (Wells first learned about the use of laughing gas from Colton's performance and used it to highlight his own achievements, burying Colton's merits) revived the use of laughing gas as an amnesia drug and finally achieved success. By 1868, the dental community had widely used laughing gas as an amnesia drug.</p>
<p>A chemist in Boston named Jackson had inhaled an excessive amount of ether in 1841 to lose consciousness, so he suggested using ether as an amnesia drug. He did not put it into practical use himself but introduced this idea to others, one of whom was named Morton. This person and Wells and Jackson were all friends, and he himself was also a dentist. First, Morton learned of Wells's discovery and consulted with Jackson and studied the large-scale production of laughing gas for the world. Jackson suggested manufacturing ether to replace it because it was easy. Later, Morton continued to study ether and finally achieved great success.</p>

<p>Shen Bao Local Supplement Discussions Let's Save the Students Zi Nan</p>
<p>The other day, Mr. Meng Ruo proposed an idea: abolish the joint entrance examination system, which I think is correct. Joint entrance examinations not only have good points in fact, but also, in order to cope with multiple subjects, one has to take shortcuts, read some joint entrance examination guides or outlines, etc. As a result, the habit of being greedy for the near and easy is developed. The popularity of books like "guides" and "outlines" in the recent publishing industry is the best ironclad proof.</p>
<p>In fact, our education system is not only like this in this one aspect, but also in many other aspects; for example, extracurricular activities are also like this.</p>
<p>Extracurricular activities are probably intended to cultivate good citizens and get used to group life, so there are various organizations of "small governments" and other small groups, forcibly pulling innocent and uncarved children together, as a training for future citizens.</p>
<p>But what is the result? To use a sentence from Meng Ruo, "The disadvantages are so great that the original advocates probably did not expect it."</p>
<p>The original intention of the advocates may be that students cannot find the door to society once they leave the school gate, so they first create a miniature social organization in the school. As a result, a short corridor is named ×× Road, etc., and even a back alley school with only three classrooms actually divides itself into what bureau and what bureau, like a small sparrow with all its internal organs.</p>
<p>This kind of official-style organization, in the end, only cultivates the children's concept of becoming officials, and nothing else can be gained. If you want to say that it is to let them experience social life first, the facts tell you that as long as you step out of the school threshold and step into society, you will open your eyes and see that everything is different, and you will know that the so-called social life in school is not that simple at all.</p>
<p>And in school, since there is such an "organization," what follows is the struggle for power and profit; I remember when I was in school, I personally experienced such a life. At that time, my grade and the highest grade were vying to be the county magistrate. In order to seize the "masses," we went around to mobilize the lower classes, and what we used as bait for mobilization was treating guests, promising to give things to the heads of the lower classes, and contacting athletes as armed bodyguards.</p>
<p>And other than that, all subjects are regarded as secondary.</p>
<p>Therefore, most high school graduates study liberal arts, law, and political economics, because these are close to the "official</p>

<p>"Save the children!" "Save the students!" The Turning Wheel Meng Hua</p>
<p>The wheel kept turning, making a rhythmic creaking sound.</p>
<p>Auntie Li squatted beside the wheel, holding the adobe brick with one hand and carefully grinding and repairing it with a bamboo board with the other. She had been working since morning, and her eyes were already blurred. The wheel under her eyes seemed to be getting bigger and bigger, like a dark cloud, hovering low over this large workshop, making everything around it dark.</p>
<p>The wheel kept turning, and the days were like the turning wheel. Auntie Li's heart was filled with those past events.</p>
<p>"The days spent under the bitter neem tree!" she thought. Her hands had never stopped. When she was a child, when other children were still playing, she would help her mother with work. Many people praised her mother in her face:</p>
<p>"Look at Xiao Tao, she's only ten years old, the time to play, and she can already earn money for her mother!"</p>
<p>"It's the child's bitter fate." Her mother said, sometimes with tears falling down. At that time, the needle in her hand would move even faster. She turned her small hands into mallets. Sometimes she would cry at night, but her mother would feel sorry for her.</p>
<p>Later, her mother died. She also grew up. Her father, who was often angry, always beat her. One day, she was taken away by a stranger.</p>
<p>The wheel was still turning. Auntie Li stood up and used her foot to push it hard. The wheel turned frantically again, creaking.</p>
<p>Auntie Li thought again: Later, people no longer called her Xiao Tao, but called her Auntie Li. Li Si was a good man. He worked in the fields all day long. She also helped him. Her hands had never been idle for a day. Soon, she was the mother of Xiao Shunzi. The three of them lived without happiness or suffering. When Xiao Shunzi was playing, he would pull weeds, scoop water, and pump water in the fields, and also deliver food to his father. People also praised Xiao Shunzi, saying that he could work like an adult at a young age. Although her mother loved her, she still didn't let her steal time to play.</p>
<p>The wheel was still turning, and Auntie Li's eyes felt even more blurred.</p>
<p>She and her man fled the famine. Because it was a famine year, the rice was scorched to death by the sun before it could spike. They begged for food, they worked short-term jobs, helping people with work, and almost sold their children. After another year, when it was almost time to harvest the rice, there was a flood. The water flooded the crops, and the water destroyed her home, drowning the dogs, pigs, and cattle alive. In this way, she and her man fled to a faraway big city. They had no relatives and could not find food to eat. So her man went to work, and she, the girl, worked on the road for people, mending socks, mending shorts, mending gowns, and she was still a twelve-year-old girl. As for herself? She worked as a lady in this porcelain factory, repairing, shaving, and grinding non-stop from morning to night, and it had been almost a year.</p>
<p>"The days spent under the bitter neem tree!" she thought to herself. Her hands had never stopped since she was born.</p>
<p>The wheel kept turning, making a creaking sound. The days were like the turning wheel, passing so quickly.</p>
<p>Auntie Li's eyes were even more blurred. She could hardly see the turning wheel. But her hands were instinctively, subconsciously, grinding and repairing. Her head also ached so much that she felt dizzy and uncomfortable.</p>
<p>The sky was getting dark. The electric lights came on. She stood up and shook herself. "Another day has passed. I don't know if Xiao Shunzi was ridiculed again by others for working today? These days are hard to endure!" Auntie Li thought as she walked out of the factory gate.</p>
<p>The days were like the turning wheel, passing so quickly.</p>
<p>Xiao Shunzi squatted beside the wheel, carefully grinding and repairing the adobe brick with a bamboo board. Her eyes were also blurred. People said that Xiao Shunzi was capable, and she went to work in the factory at the age of thirteen to earn money. But Xiao Shunzi swallowed the tears in her heart and thought, "If I don't work, then I have to eat coal slag!"</p>
<p>When she looked at the wheel, she remembered her mother. "Mom was exhausted to death by these hardships. Now, it's my turn to fill Mom's vacancy. When will the suffering be enough?"</p>
<p>The wheel kept turning, making a rhythmic, creaking sound.</p>
<p>The days were like the turning wheel, passing so quickly.</p>
<p>"Turn! Turn! Turn! Turn as much as you can!" Xiao Shunzi said softly. General Ward Ling Zixi</p>
<p>The lowest-grade ward of the sanatorium, including myself, was tightly packed with eight people. And all eight people had to exhale the breath of their illness in this small room with only two windows. Thinking about it, it was very terrible and very uncomfortable.</p>
<p>We had just finished lunch, and it was still early before the scheduled lunch time. The sky had not been sunny since morning, always with a gloomy look. Moreover, the wind was blowing, and it was raining again. Several patients had not slept well last night, tossing and turning all night. In the morning, they asked the nurse Miss to ask the doctor to come and examine them in a good voice. The doctor came with a displeased look. He scolded several people: "You don't know how to take care of yourselves, and you still cause trouble, always asking for examinations! Haven't you been examined last week? If you want to be examined every day, go live in the first-class ward! You these...!"</p>
<p>The patients closed their mouths like prisoners, and a feeling of fear passed through their bodies, trembling and worrying; God, I hope it's not "you these lowly people"!</p>
<p>"People in the lowest-grade ward are really destined to be lowly people," one person, coughing repeatedly, muttered sadly to himself after the doctor and nurse had left.</p>
<p>No one answered him, and he sighed and slowly began to say: "What a world! In this era, poor people who get rich people's diseases only have death to look forward to. If it weren't for my wife and children being still young, I wouldn't want to come to a sanatorium."</p>
<p>"That's right," an old patient by the window said in a hoarse voice, shaking as he took up his words: "I've been a hard laborer for most of my life, and that's enough. It's not enough to get a body full of diseases. For the sake of my family's livelihood, I have to borrow money to come to a sanatorium, but after three or five months, I still have to go back to hard labor, still have to..."</p>
<p>When a person is over fifty years old, a sense of resentment is added to the sadness.</p>
<p>Hearing these words, several people stared blankly, watching the raindrops pattering on the window.</p>
<p>"Alas," a long sigh floated from the bed in the corner of the room: "Speaking of life, I myself have climbed it like a snail climbing a mountain, steep and strenuous, but I have climbed it for more than thirty years. But who would have thought that I would get this kind of disease from hard labor? People say that this is a rich person's disease. People like us, who are crowded into a small room with seven or eight people, don't get ultraviolet light, don't take expensive tonics, and don't use artificial pneumothorax - inventions that benefit mankind are not for us! Every day we eat a few bowls of porridge, measure our temperature, endure the anger of doctors and nurses, and listen to the groans of others... Do you think there's any use in this? Isn't it just waiting to die? I often think: why bother seeing a doctor when you're living this kind of life?"</p>
<p>"That's right. At this time, it's basically a crime for poor people to get sick! How can we still have the right to be treated?..."</p>
<p>In the corridor, hurried footsteps floated by, and the sounds of talking floated in intermittently: the people in the room were cold at heart, like the wet earth outside, and the rain kept beating down...</p>
<p>The weather was gloomy and cold, and the wind blew in from the window. People shivered with cold. It was already the full mood of early winter. We, a group of people with sick bodies and minds, were thinking about this sick world. It seemed that everything was as bad as we were, and we needed a thorough X-ray examination and enthusiastic ultraviolet light therapy.</p>
<p>There was a soft sound of footsteps outside the door, and the nurse opened the door again, looked around, and then said in a commanding tone: "Quiet! Don't talk too much. How can the patients be allowed to talk so much! It's nap time, everyone has to sleep well!" She came over and pulled up the covers for everyone, and then went out again, slamming the door shut - leaving us inside the door, all silent and quiet.</p>
<p>I fell asleep deeply, but the annoying, cold drizzle was still falling outside. Desolate Village Xiao Qi</p>
<p>The warm sunlight is always so softly illuminating the earth, the trees in the fields are always swaying in various poses in the gentle morning breeze, infused with freshness, and unknown birds are still singing sweetly in the shade of the trees. However, the dynamics of some active people under the sunlight are gradually declining.</p>
<p>Farmers should be like animals all year round, but everyone is willing to be busy with their hands and feet without stopping for a moment, plowing the fields and sowing, scooping water, and cutting seedlings. In those fields and in those seeds, they know that they will be irrigated by their own sweat and strength to produce ears of large millet, which will then turn into shiny gold. They always look forward to this time with pleasant hearts. So the work becomes more and more intense, and the days pass quite energetically. No one has room to worry about anything, but what about now? Everyone is idle and panicked. The thick arms have nowhere to use, so they are only used to beat women when they get angry. Many fields have been abandoned, and grass plants have made their homes. All those who can leave have left, and those who cannot move can only endure the desolate days while half-starving.</p>
<p>The previous beautiful scene is already a dream world.</p>
<p>In the fields, there is no path that has been walked out of the grass, because no one has passed by for a long time, and it is covered by fluffy wild grass. It is still impossible to find the path. Nor are there any shadows of groups of shepherds, riding on the backs of cows, walking while opening their high-pitched voices to sing along with the birds in the shade of the trees. Bare-armed farmers with hoes can only see sparse shadows of a few people in the vast fields. In the past, there would be three or five people in every small field, some pushing shovels to turn the soil, some soaking their legs in the water, pulling weeds, working diligently, with healthy smiles on their faces and murmuring on their lips.</p>
<p>Beside the shallow pond, there are also the lively and cheerful voices of women washing clothes, and the childish and loud laughter.</p>
<p>Where have those healthy smiles and cheerful voices disappeared to? Early in the morning, there is no bustling crowd in the desolate fields, no groups of shepherds, only small birds singing desolately. And from the fields to the village, similarly, on the street, you can no longer see crowded people carrying burdens, especially in the morning, only a few idle people walking around in the cold and quiet. In the endless houses next to each other, although smoke rises from the roofs, you can only see a wisp of black smoke flying away in the fog every ten houses. In front of each house, no one comes out for a long time. Some are even locked, and the door knockers have grown rust. The people here seem to be dwindling day by day, and it seems impossible to make them nostalgic. They are scattering in all directions to other places. From the fields to the city, the villages are gradually deserted. Broadcasting</p>

<p>Song Introduction</p>
<p>The Swallow Tower</p>
<p>The setting sun is late at Wuyi Port, and the wild grass is cold by the Vermilion Bird Bridge. The passing water flows in vain, and the fallen flowers are ruthlessly destroyed. Seeing things and thinking of people makes my heart gloomy, and I can't help but shed red tears on my silk dress. As the saying goes, ill-fated beauties are used to it, but I am not a beauty and my fate is also difficult. The former prosperity turned into fleeting clouds in the blink of an eye, and the long nights are filled with dreams. My shadow is alone, leaving behind loneliness. I only see the swallows returning as before, but they never return. Zhang Shangshu is too wronged, with thousands of sorrows. Twenty years of shared dreams, how can I bear to look back? In the past, I used to get drunk with you, sir, in this tower, knocking on the zither and singing. In the boudoir, behind the beaded curtain, the singing and dancing spread out. It is truly like all the immortals singing the Rainbow Skirt Dance together. I am willing to be like pine and cypress, hoping to be with my pillow and quilt forever, enjoying music and resigning from officialdom, better than being a governor guarding the frontier. Although the spring breeze is blooming with peach and plum blossoms, I also see the autumn rain falling on the leaves of the plane trees. Human fame and fortune are as precious as bubbles, and since ancient times, separation and reunion have been the law of circulation. Even if I meet a kindred spirit, how can I bear to live alone in an empty room? I used to sail in the same boat, and I often sighed to myself. The night is long, the lamp is dim, the more I think, the more I think, again and again. Your kindness is as high as a mountain, and your grace is as deep as the sea. I must repay you. I cannot repay you for wearing a ring and knotting grass. I originally wanted to follow you to the grave, but I am afraid of tarnishing your public image. I am ashamed to steal a life, and it is difficult for me to be a person! Now, I can hardly eat the delicious food, and I am too lazy to play the jade flute and the zither. The embroidered headband, the ruyi hairpin, and the osmanthus comb are still too lazy to dress up. The wedding bed is quickly cleaned up, and it is difficult to sleep in the warm lotus fragrance. From now on, in this Swallow Tower, let the spider webs bury the tracks. I will cut off all ties with the world, and I will have no regrets. I will be a Vermilion Bird flying high, not a fallen phoenix. Special Programs The Nightingale Art Society</p>

<p>Cheng Fangzhou Li Liansun Mao Jiashu Huamei (1060) 1:00 PM to 1:45 PM Opening "Traces of Rouge" Traces of rouge are sung. Right and wrong are presented truthfully. Let's listen to it for fun. It's nothing more than a game to pass the time. The Flower Branch Sisters return to Yu Shun. They are the daughters of Emperor Yao, Ehuang and Nuying. Xia Meixi was naturally extravagant. Wine was the swimming pool and meat was the forest. Jie wanted to write a book of loyal farmers. He invented various tortures. King Zhou tempted her to smile and favored Baosi. The beacon fire caused chaos for no reason. Xishi, a woman from Zhuluo Village, avenged the State of Yue by destroying the State of Wu. Xiang Yu committed suicide under the Wujiang River, and Yu Ji became famous for her martyrdom for all eternity. Marrying and making peace out of necessity, Zhao Jun bid farewell to her distant homeland. Happiness is boundless in the land of tenderness, and Zhao Feiyan danced lightly on her palm. Yin Lihua's beautiful name was spread by Emperor Guangwu, and she was actually made empress to assist in the restoration of the dynasty. The Eighteen Songs of a Nomad's Flute return to the Eastern Han Dynasty, and it is admirable that Wen Ji harmonized the rhythm. Diao Chan was unwilling to be locked up by Cao Cao, leaving only the Bronze Sparrow Tower to talk about the depth of spring. Xue Tao's needlework was praised as ingenious, and she won the fame of the night in the Wei Palace. Green Pearl was originally ambitious and vowed to uphold her chastity and not marry. Zhang Shi Hua was favored by Emperor Chen, and her hair could be used as a mirror to receive deep favor. Hong Fu recognized the hero with her wise eyes, and they all eloped for love. Wu Zetian was ruthless and poisoned her mother and murdered her king to seize the throne. On the seventh day of the seventh month, in the Hall of Eternal Life, Taizhen expressed his heart at midnight. Willow waist, cherry lips, Xiao Man and Fan Su were matched with poets. The heroic Liang Hongyu personally held the drumsticks to fight the Jin soldiers. Dong Xiaowan in Yan Yue Tower had unparalleled talent and was skilled in painting. Countless beauties throughout the ages are difficult to enumerate, and their stories are clearly recorded in history. I'll stop writing for now. Xia Hesheng's Three Smiles</p>
<p>Dunben (800) 7:00 PM to 8:00 PM Opening "Liu Ruan Ascends to Tiantai" Ruan Zhao and Liu Chen were two scholars who were like bosom friends in their lives. They happened to meet the Double Ninth Festival and drank a cup of dogwood wine while drunk. They were both tipsy and went out for a walk. They collected herbs and refined elixirs together, following the medicine hoe day by day. They went to the depths of the white clouds at leisure, and accidentally entered Tiantai Mountain. Cave heaven and blessed land are rare in the world, and they lost their way home. Suddenly, they heard the sound of jade pendants, clouds and hairpins, purple jade hairpins. Their beauty was peerless and their beauty was unparalleled, shining brightly on the golden walls. They were invited in with joy, and the love affair of the previous life was fulfilled in this life. Liu Lang will always be a guest on the fairy mountain, and Ruan Zhao still wants to return to his hometown. The children met each other and did not recognize each other, and asked with a smile where you came from. The children have grown up, and the wives have become old and weak. They talked about decades of separation, half joy and half sorrow. Looking back, there were only a few days in the mountains, and a lifetime in the world had passed. The fairy and mortal roads are not far apart, and from then on they regret their wealth and fame. They went to Tiantai again to find the old road, sighing and wandering before leaving. They hoped that the past would not be chased, and Beauty and Art</p>
