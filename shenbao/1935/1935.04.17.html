<p>— 仁</p>
<p>最近報載黔省以實行禁烟收入减少。省府决議自五月一日起。裁撤駢枝機關。停發或减少各項補助費。預計每月可節省二萬三千餘元。此事在中國財政待理之今日。實為一極可慶幸之消息也。</p>
<p>民國二十餘年來之財政。不問為中央抑或地方。大都入不敷出赤字累累。就一般之情形論。幾乎無省不虧空。無年不舉債。而此種虧空與債務。又大都造因於政費之膨脹。國民政府成立以來。一切吏治已較往昔北政府時代為改良。但因人設事之現象似乎猶未盡除。此在邊疆名省尤為顯。著年來政府之談整理財政者。大都已注意及此。故開源節流之說濅已為理財不二法門。</p>
<p>夫開源與節流本為二事。既言開源必須有源可開而開。之必無傷於人民。既言節流必須有流可節而節。之必又無碍於施政。就我國之現狀論。國民經濟衰落。可開之源無多政費日見膨脹。可節之流似亦不少。卽就財政整理之難易言。恐亦與其開源母寗節流。雖依原則論。國家之財政應為「量出為入。」但所謂「出」者。必須為有關國家前途必要之「支出。」而非包括一切不必要之支出。至於今日中國財政之支出中。若駢枝機關之開支。要皆為不必要之支出。</p>
<p>國家之財政乃取之於民用之於民。故欲使財政上無匱乏。必須於支配經費之餘。兼顧及於人民之負擔力。然後國家政務既不致因而妨碍。國民經濟亦不致因以有損。換言之今日財政上苟能省一分不必要之支出。卽為人民多保一分元氣。亦卽為來日財政上多增一分可開之源也。</p>
<p>今日黔省每月雖僅節省二萬三千餘元。在財政數字上言為數極微。然而月計之不足歲計之有餘。月省二萬三千元。年省二十七萬六千元。此一政策。若能擴而充之。在禁烟命令下之八省。年各節省二十七萬元。則轉眼間卽達二百二十萬元。若全國各省皆能聞風勵行。則地方財政之欲求其年節八九百萬元自非難事。若更進一步。中央財政亦能酌量緊縮。則欲其年省數千萬元。或亦不難。集腋可以成裘。聚沙可以為洲。當此國計民生苦悶之際。全國財政果能皆如黔省實行緊縮。則匪特可以為中國財政劃一新的時代。亦且可以為改善今日國民經濟環境之一法也。</p>

<p>（日內瓦）國聯行政院今日開會、討論法國所要求之斥責德國破壞凡爾賽和約問題、據悉德國如於其邊境解除武裝地帶違背條約、則英意兩國準備給予法國以軍事上之援助、兩國於斯德萊薩會議中已重申羅迦洛條約之諾言、保證萊茵河一帶之和平、並决於某種條伴之下、出諸軍事行動、國聯行政院之秘密曾議祇一小時、休會後藉悉斯干的那維亞半島各國主張對德和緩、且稍减法國所提决議案之激烈語氣、挪威外長孟起會與英國外相西門會商良久、其後孟氏卽力促行政院通過一種空洞之决議案、且勿譴責德國破壞和約、同時並悉英國代表甚慮英意兩國在斯德萊薩宣言合作、恐柏林所誤解為對於德國政府之一種威嚇、故英國代表為解除誤會起見、已於今夜愼重聲明、謂此項宣言、「並非許法國以助力、但為一種相互的協議而已、」法國方面則竭力運動對德採取嚴厲行動、法國代表已向丹麥·波蘭·及其他欲興德國維持好威主張和緩之國家疏通、擬使彼等不加反對、而通過斯特萊薩三國會議之决議、至於蘇俄外長李維諾夫則猶嫌該項决議過於和緩、惟李氏自悉法國外長賴伐爾已與小協約國代表磋商取得彼等贊助之後、亦卽撤消其反對、據可靠消息、小協約國已允准許奧匈保三國各備陸軍七萬五千人、捷克外長皮尼士曾向賴伐爾稱、小協約國並不反對三國增加自衛軍力、惟須保證三國皆能參加保安公約、按小協約國之態度、可以某發言人之語槪之、其言日、「吾人對斯德萊薩會議之結果頗為滿意、現在吾人惟注意於將來之問題、最重要者為維持奧國獨一之公約」云、行政院明日將再行開會、消息靈通方面預料國聯將通過宣言、其要點如下、</p>
<p>（一）國聯對於德國之廢棄凡爾賽和約不能視為合法、</p>
<p>（二）德國之舉動殊為「可憾、」因此舉係對於一切條約之打擊、</p>
<p>（三）德國既破壞和約、故須詳細研究如何應付將來再有違約舉動之方法、此間英國方面承認、斯特萊薩之聯合宣言實含有英國保證維持德國邊境解除武裝區域之意、惟稱、此項宣言並非專事對德、英國發言人並謂、該項宣言不僅保障法國對付德國之侵略、同時亦保障德國對付法國之侵略云、（十六日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據英國國會方面意見、英國出席斯德萊柴會議之代表、對於歐洲大陸、並未接受何種新約束、此屛殊可滿意，國會方面又以為德國接受參加一般互不侵犯公約之談判、同時並不妨碍他國訂結雙方互助公約、此舉實為國際時局之眞實進步、惟對於德國此種新態度、不能過分期望其有實際效果、至關於奧匈保三國重整軍備一事、則表示使奧匈保三國獲得軍備平等權、雖無不可、然希望此種平等權、不至超過某種合理之限度云、（十五日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>國民新聞社十六日上海消息、中國銀行董事長宋子文氏、鑒於今日某通訊社所發彼之談話稿、稍有不確實之處、特將其正式談話稿、交由國民新聞社發表如下、宋氏首稱、我國遭遇、確甚艱難、惟吾人須持鎭定、蓋舉世正陷於經濟蕭條中也、上海固受害最烈、然我國以農立國、農民所受不良影饗尚漫、而上海之繁榮、終須內地是賴、目下內地情形大見進步、上海必受其澤惠、此實堪慶幸者、宋氏續稱、彼已與若干中外銀行家非正式交換意見、其結果令人大為感動、蓋彼等均能無分中外爾我、而協力對付此共同問題、此又堪慶幸者、此外財政部長固守其健全金融及健全財政政策、運屬重要、宋氏言至此、遂重行聲明稱、彼曾得政府保證、决無通貨膨脹之舉、綜觀上述諸要素、吾人對於前途、實屬大可樂觀、至於美國續將銀價自六角四分提高至七角一分之舉、未氏稱、此當然增重吾國之艱難、但以嚴禁私運生銀出口辦法、現頗見成效、故上海方面、不致發生恐慌云、中央社云、全國經濟委員會常委兼中國銀行董事長朱子文氏、昨日上午十時許、在中國銀行接見各報社記老、發表下列之談話、</p>
<p>外商銀行表示合作</p>
<p>據宋氏談、本人就任中國銀行董事長以來、迄未與外國銀行界有所酬酢、故詩淤十四日邀請外國銀行界午餐、（記者按宋宅是日曾否認此事）參加者、計有匯豐·花旗·麥加利·匯理·三菱·及正金各銀行總理、曁席德懋·貝淞蓀·兩氏、席間對於金融問題作非正式之交換意見、結果頗為良好、在座者、均能以金融為重、而以本身利益為輕、通力合作、對白銀問題、亦均表示自動不再運銀出口、本人業將交換意見之結果、轉達孔財長矣、</p>
<p>並無大批現銀出口</p>
<p>關於白銀出口平衡稅之是否需要增加問題、此事權在財部、本人處於銀行界之地位、一切聽命於財部、未便表示意見、惟據本人所知、邇來並無大批現銀出口、政府對於美國之提高銀價、仍微續不斷的向美國政府表示、此種舉動、實有損於中國、迄今尚無其他新的行動、報載比國齊蘭德總理準備發起會議、以促進世界主要貨幣之重行穩定云云、本人對於此項會議之內容、不甚明瞭、惟齊蘭德氏曾在美執敎有年、渠之思想、恐與羅斯福總統相接近、</p>
<p>深望國人鎭靜處之</p>
<p>本人觀察我國金融之前途、絕無恐慌之理由、信鬼始見鬼、深望國人鎭靜處之、母相自擾、關於救濟工商借欺、業經决定以五百萬作為商業信用借欵、一千五百萬作為工商抵押借欵、至於銀行方面如何支配、尚未確定、將來中國銀行方面、自當盡力辦理、全國經濟委員會對於全部金融、目前並無計劃、本人定於日內入京一行、有所商洽云、</p>
<p>三行合併絕不可能</p>
<p>新聲社記者叩以有主張中央中國交通三行合併、使集中實力、成立一大銀行、以應付中國經濟環境者、宋氏謂、三行業務不同、中央為銀行之銀行、中國為國際匯兌銀行、交通為實業銀行、性質完全各異、譬如中央對普通銀行業務、絕對並不經營、準是以觀、試問三行如何合併、此乃絕對不可能者</p>
<h3 id="c120">二千萬大放欵　俟財部令到會商辦法　本市存銀三萬萬餘人心安定外商銀行昨决議不運銀出口 <a href="#c120" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e120" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">120</a></h3>
<p>新新社云、救濟工商二千吁萬放欵抉定後、市面氣象、頗現活躍、中中交三行、現待財部訓令到滬後、卽會同銀行公會討論進行辦法、公會方面籌集之信用小借欵一百八十八萬五千元、將來决併入辦理、昨日平衡稅率照常、外匯稍見放長、茲分誌各情如次、</p>
<p>二千萬元各行分認</p>
<p>財政部長孔祥熙氏與金融界會商結果、决定以一千五百萬辦工廠抵押放欵、五百萬辦信用保證放欵後、該二千萬元數額之來源、各界頗為注意、新新社記者昨日特往訪曾參加前日金融界會議之銀行負責人、據談、二千萬元放欵、須待財部訓令到滬後、由中央銀行主持、會同中交兩行及銀行公會會員銀行、討論進行辦法、至該欵來源、將以中央·中國·交通·三行為基本、而以其他各行為殿軍、至將來是否組織銀團、抑或由三行負責辦理放欵、尚待會商後、再行决定、</p>
<p>信用借欵併入辦理</p>
<p>銀行公會循地方協會及市商會等團體舉辦之信用小借欵、早經由會員銀行認定一百八十八萬五千元、（五千元係某銀行昨日加入）因各種關係、致遲遲未能實行放欵、昨據銀行公會消息、政府現已决定、以二千萬元舉行放欵、救濟工商、好在彼此宗旨相同、銀行公會擬將所籌之數額、加入二千萬元中之五百萬元信用保證放欺合併辦理、不擬另行舉辦、以省手續、</p>
<p>工商各業表示滿意</p>
<p>據工商業方面表示、本市工商各業為謀救濟起見、曾要求金融界舉辦物產抵押及信用放欺、財部已與金融界會商决定、以二千萬元舉辦工廠抵押信用保證放欵、雖數額較要求時為少、但當茲工商業亟待救濟之際、得有二千萬元查金周轉流通、事實上已獲益多多、但望當局與金融界、早日實行、以救工商而安市面、</p>
<p>外滙稍長平稅照常</p>
<p>外匯平市委員會昨日上午十時、會商决定之平衡稅率、為百分之六·七五、與前相同、至中央銀行昨日公布之電匯賣價折合、均見放長、茲照錄如下、倫敦每國幣一元為一先令七便士六二五、較前日一先令七便士半大一二五、紐約每國幣一百元為三九美元六八七五、較前日三九美元三七五、大三一二五、巴黎每國幣一百元為六百法郎、較前日大六法郎、柏林每國幣一百元為九八馬克、較前日大一馬克、</p>
<p>滬市存銀三萬萬餘</p>
<p>據中央銀行經濟研究室發表、上週本市中外各銀行存銀總數為三三七·一五六（單位千元下同）內華商銀行為二八六·七九二、外商銀行祇五〇·三六四、佔全額祇六分之一、前週中外各行總數三三四·六九六、足微華商銀行存銀日見豐厚云、</p>
<p>外商銀行昨商合作</p>
<p>新聲社云、朱子文與外商銀行晤談金融後、外商銀行於昨日下午四時、在麥加利銀行舉行會議、參加者、如英商之匯豐·麥加利·有利·大英·美商之花旗·美豐·大通·日商之正金·三井·朝鮮·台灣·三菱、法商之匯理·中法·及華比·嗬　·德華·義華等、及至下午六時許始散、據新聲社記者探悉、討論者為與宋子文晤談决定與我國銀行錢莊一致合作、共謀安定市面、如外商銀行停止運銀出口等、聞已一致通過、</p>

<h3 id="c161">漫談「浪漫主義」 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— 雋永</p>
<p>在談到藝術上的浪漫主義時我們所必得注意的是：正如藝術上的現實主羲之不一定和哲學上的唯物主義相一致同樣，藝術上的浪漫主義和藝術上的觀念主義也並不是同一的東西。事實上，特定的浪漫主義藝術（例如十九世紀初頭德國底觀念的幻想的浪漫主議文學）體現着觀念主義的方法，但同時藝術史的事實也正顯示出：不以客觀的現實底妄想的反映，而以被包含終現實本身中的「可能性」和「發展的動因」之主情的强調為特微的浪漫主義的作品（如雪萊·海雲叙情詩）屬於觀念主義的浪漫主義藝術，在藝術史上，始終是沒落的階級，由於其歷史的任務所次定，當巳失却其進步性而開始走向自己的墓墳時，不敢正視現實，因而沈緬於過往的偉蹟底慷憬，殘駭底迷戀時所發出的一種反歷史進化的藝術傾向，在這種浪漫主義藝術中，也不像辛人先生所晚的一樣，「因其本身是道黑暗的一部分，所以儘管他們的「空想」帶着種種的形態，在本質上却是對於黑晤白謳歌」，她同樣也包含着這種「空想」——感覺到對於這種黑暗有給予以淸滌的必要，然而他們却並不曾客觀地觀察現實，看出歷史的動力，而在還上面寄託他們的現實底的空想，而是從自己的主觀的觀念出發，把客觀的現實予以主觀的幻想的藝術底的表現。</p>
<p>在對於進步的浪漫主義的評價上，首先注意到牠底史的發展及其歴史的本質的變化是必要的。新興階級的抬頭期的浪漫主義以及掌握政權後而入於最高社會之建設期的浪漫主義，在性質上也多少是有不同的地方。作為初期的浪漫主義的特微的東西，可以說是在現寶生活上刺戟着藝術家的感情的一種熾烈的，偉大的，實現可能性的崇高的理想底「主情的」强調和表現。也正因為這種「主情的强調」，所以體現於新興階級初期的浪漫王義中的，多少常是一種比較抽象的，崇高的理想底憧憬，一種以可怕的熱力的對於未來光明底誕生底謳歌。這「主情的强調」也正是初期的新浪漫主羲的特質。——當然這種特質也由於各個別的作家底素質，才能及技術稈度而呈異彩。</p>
<p>在目前被提倡着的新浪漫主義，在若干程度上，是和初期的新浪漫主義不同的。在目前，新浪漫主義，乃是作為現實主羲，作為一種多彩的豐當的潑刺的創作方法之一要素而被處理着的。現在的新浪漫主義之所以和初期的新浪漫主義不同的地方，就因為作為浪漫主義底對象的羅曼司，已不再僅是存在於現實本身中的「可能的」東西，而且作為客觀現實底一要素的了。羅曼蒂克不僅是存在於現在而將被實現於未來的「可能的東西，而巳是存在於現實中的東西了。就正因為這種羅曼蒂克的要素巳是為客觀現實所固有的，因而浪漫主羲也正作為現實主義底一要素而被說明着。因而這時候「主清的强調一巳不是浪漫主義惟一特徵，這時候，浪漫主義巳經作為和現實主義不可分離的東西，而被融合被綜合於現實主義中了。因為，站在「反映論」上說，這時候假如現實主義是透視並表現了社會的人間的現實的，那麼牠就必然地應是浪漫主義的的原故。</p>
<p>在這一點上同意辛人先生說的：「凡歷史上新興的文學，必然地是『現實的浪漫的』。」然而我僅在這裏賦與以一點制限即：「現實的浪漫的」是歷史上新興文學底特微，不過在這裏透視其歷史的發展以及隨道一發展而來的本質底變化，是必要的，而且我們還不能以「現實的浪漫的」作為歷史上每一新興階級的文學底特徵而自告滿足，我們同時，還應該注意到牠底「現實的」底歷史的吸階級的制限性，也只有說明了這一點，我們才能够全般地理解布爾的現實主義和新現實主義底本質底差異。尤其是在前一點（卽指新興階級底浪漫主義底歷史的發展以及隨這一發展而來的本質底變化）必須給予以深切的注意。我以為辛人先生之把新興階級的浪漫主義作為一種「通過黑暗的現實，對光明作熱烈的『憧憬』」的「空想」，只是新與階級的浪漫主義底初期的形態，而不是牠底整個發展底姿態底全部。不理解這一點，不理解新浪漫主義底史的發展及質的變化，想理解目前的新浪漫主義，是不可能的。</p>
<h3 id="c162">濁流中 <a href="#c162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— 王瑩</p>
<p>不願說到關於生的一面苦痛的話，一切的人都喜歡見着笑的臉——卽使那笑是十分吃力的——我明白了此這更多的所謂「生存」的道理，因此，有多少次了，我提起筆，終於不能寫成一篇像樣的東西。</p>
<p>在灰黯的心情中生活着，可以把淚江河似地無止境地向着心底傾流；在冷寂的深夜，對着無光的燈，失聲地哭泣着，但，在人霉中，却非笑得動聽不可的，卽使是如此，也還是不能生活得好一點；非在顚撲和誣蔑中，在欺侮和打擊中，苟延着殘喘不可。整個的時代是在受難之中，因此，生存於這時代中的靑年們，是怎樣地被磨折得透不過氣來了。</p>
<p>在東京，我看過了一張新俄的片子，題目是「生存」，記得的很淸楚，是跑了兩天，買了四次票，才買着了一張沒有椅子的入座券，是冬天，戲院沒有暖氣一類的設備，但，却給擠着的人堆，蒸得流着汗，那片子是只有三個人的戲，而且是兩小時中的經過事情，以時鐘走着的聲音，來抓緊着觀衆們的情緒；大意是這樣的：每一個人，——說得廣汎一點，每一個生物——都需要渴求着「生存」，但，如今的世界是有着這兩類的人，一類是只顧自己的存活，而不顧念別人的生存和死亡，甚至於剝奪了別人的生存的權利；一類是希望着大家活着。可是，我們却不幸地存活在這「只顧自己的生存」的這類人的社會掌握裏了。</p>
<p>好像沒有好好地活過一天，自從被推進了這張着血口的人羣中。這世界是沒有「黑和白」「是與非」之分的，每秒鐘所接觸的，只是灰黯和迷矇，而且是下着大霧的陰鬱的沒有完結的黑夜，在這裏包圍着我們的，是無邊的寒冷和憂鬱。對着這無止盡的夜，我已經是不能成聲地偶而地在呻吟着了。</p>
<h3 id="c163">靑島的公園 <a href="#c163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— 劉明</p>
<p>讓竟大的沙路，將我們領進德國槐林。不知名的小鳥，在看不見的地方，喜結子喜結子地呌着。尚未發葉的樹上，綴着大顆大顆的烏巢，白藤黑羽的鴉鵲，悄悄地落下地來，啄着什麼，又悄悄地飛了上去。偶然也有兩馬拖着載石的笨車，在粗漢子的呼喝聲裏，頓頓地走了出來，但一會兒，便又重歸靜寂。如果走到高一點的地方，從樹枝陳處看了出去，則披松的山坡和碧綠的海面，都在不遠的四周，盡也似地顯現。</p>
<p>像這樣誰還覺得是遊公園呢？簡直像在山林中作長途旅行了。</p>
<p>靑島的第一公園實在大得可愛呵。佔地約一千六百多畝，中分許多馬路，可以通行汽車。各路都取花為名，如銀杏路海棠路梅花路櫻花路等是。我們去的這一天，正是櫻花盛開的時候，夜來落過雨，路都是微微潤濕的，散步的遊人，就沾了光，再不像往天似的，會吃那汽車掃過來的灰塵。</p>
<p>北國的春天，是來得很遲的，桃花和榆葉梅還帶着畏怯寒意的樣子，半露出紅色的臉。同異國的櫻花，競賽姿態的只有娥黃的金鐘花和血似的杜鵑花了。遙想此時的江南，不正是「雜花生樹，羣鶯亂飛」的「暮春三月」麼？但人們尚有特意從南方跑來此間，看個兩三天春景而又忽忽歸去的。在身居北地的人看來，倒是有些愚哩。然而，將可能賑濟災民的錢，從這方面寫意花去，畢竟算是聰明些吧。</p>
<p>大約由於上午的原故，公園裏很少遇見摩登的男女，緩緩步在櫻花樹下的，却大半是些平常的商人和鄉下來的粗漢子。由這一點，靑島公園之能與衆同樂，不像上海公園需要出錢遊玩，到底是値得贊美的。</p>
<p>在這裏，我們也看見了年老的女人們，將她們曾經在結婚時候為客人嘖嘖稱贊的小足，糟雜地印在落有花瓣的泥沙道上，大槪人們對此還不感到深切的痛苦吧，一些幼小的女孩，也在拐着一雙不自然的足，正在追蹤祖母親們的後塵呢。這在公園裏尚不多見，平民住的地方，却為數不少了。據葉恭綽靑邱遊屑一文謂「市府積極勸人放足，聲明若干時後，須派人曬騐，曾否實行，及派女職員查騐，竟有畏騐而自縊者，又曾拘至期不放足者之父兄，罰銀十元，歸後遷怒女子，逼之自盡，市府因此祗可緩進。」北方人的樸實，是可敬的，但頑固的程度，却令人可怕。</p>
<p>歸途中，在海濱公園側拾含苞的桃枝兩條，（大約為鄉下人所摘經警察訓斥而丟棄的吧，）揷在瓶裏，讓春天與我們同在一些時候。</p>
<h3 id="c164">巨卿先生（十五） <a href="#c164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>— 柯靈</p>
<p>還沒有到家，一個學生就氣急敗壞地跑來告訴他：學堂裏的先生巳經在他家裏捉私塾了。——更大的意外的突擊！</p>
<p>聽着道消息，閃電般迅速的，巨卿先生鐵靑的臉色轉成了死人般的慘白。站住了，一聲不響。在極短促的時間裏，兩個問題在他心裏作了一次激：回去？不回去？</p>
<p>全身火燒那麼的焦灼，好一會，他終於向家裏走去了。</p>
<p>屋子裏有三個年靑的教員，一個瘦瘦長長的，和一個眉毛眼睛都倒掛着的小個子，在逐一翻着學生的書桌抽屜，把一些幼學瓊林和孟子之類的古書搜出來挾在掖下：還是那一套調查私塾的老法于。十幾個學生睜大了眼睛望住他們。章校長穿了一身藏靑嗶嘰的學生裝，把兩乎向褲袋裏一揷，那姿勢使他增加了幾分傲岸不羣的神氣。巨卿先生跑進去，他正「稍息」似地仲出一隻脚在前面，不知向巨卿師母詰問些什麼。</p>
<p>巨卿先生踏進書房的時候，大家都楞了一楞。緊張的空氣中的剎那的靜默。</p>
<p>進來的人氣咻咻地喘息着，許多時候才換過一口氣。勉强鎭定了，凄苦地榨出一絲笑影，拱着手說：</p>
<p>「請坐請坐，各位先生。」</p>
<p>對着這老人的卑怯的神態，章校長覺得回一點客氣也不必要。他挺一挺胸脯，彷彿自己的身體長了許多。</p>
<p>「不坐。」腦袋向下微微地頓了一下（旁人完全看不出來），算是點頭：「我們要在這裏調查一下。」</p>
<p>「是的，是的。」巨卿先生竭力裝得和氣，「我們慢慢的都要改良。」</p>
<p>靠近傍晚的微弱的陽光，嫩嫩地射在壁角上，書房裏已經顯得暮色蒼茫的樣子。在很短的沉默的時間裏，巨卿先生用了最大的忍耐工夫鎭定自己，焦急地思盧着怎麼把當前的局面和平地敷衍過去；而章校長却正在為巨卿先生過分謙和的態度稍稍感到徬徨，他的心裏正有一股不穩的火熖在衝動，在找着爆發的機會。</p>
<h3 id="c165">中國藝術國際展覽會出品過目記 <a href="#c165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>— 曹聚仁</p>
<p>在老爺太太小姐少爺面前展覽中國古代的鄉術品，本來是件對牛彈琴的事。我在展覽會兩小時，接　聽到幾位少奶奶的感慨：「眞眞嘸哈好看！眞眞嘸啥好看！」兩塊錢，在她們本來算不得什麼；但她們總覺得不如化這兩塊錢去看梅蘭芳的戲或是看跳舞，跑狗之類來得有道理。他們的輿論有這樣幾種：</p>
<p>「像，倒畫得很像的！」</p>
<p>「那末，眞眞唐伯虎祝枝山的畫來哉！」</p>
<p>「這個人倒是很有名氣的！」</p>
<p>「宋太祖阿是洪武皇帝？」</p>
<p>「宋太祖是趙匡胤。」</p>
<p>「戲台上的趙匡胤是紅面的，這個人的臉怎麼一點不紅的？」</p>
<p>「這些爛泥堆挖出來的破銅爛鐵有什麼道理？（指新鄭出土的銅器）</p>
<p>另外還有半缸酷秀才出身的鑒賞家，又有各式各樣的輿論：</p>
<p>「乾隆，雍正眞是才子皇帝，你看上面都有『御覽之寶』。」</p>
<p>「這首詩題得好。」</p>
<p>「趙孟頫（他們讀作桃）的字算得嘸啥，有才子氣。」</p>
<p>「這是眞宋本的五柳先生傳。」（用自來水筆抄下來）</p>
<p>「這個呌做甲骨，用來卜課的。」（指一塊牛骨。）</p>
<p>「這個呌　，那個又呌鼎，哈道理？」</p>
<p>「還是玉器比銅器好看。」</p>
<p>這三四百高貴看客中，所發的議論大體是這樣；我彷彿聽得那些藝術品都在嘆息。這眞不是展覽中國的古代藝術品，而是展覽一些吃膩了魚肉的市民的愚蠢，賤陋，無常識。這是兩塊錢門票的必然結果：眞要賞鑒藝術的，眞想了解古代文化的，都關在門外，不能進去看一看呢！</p>
<p>就展覽會的全部出品看來，書畫部分未免佔得太多。書畫中，自有極好的；但要把紙上的作品，當作中國藝術品來介紹，此例就未免太高。歐洲人早已見過中國的壁畫，木刻，種種，為什麼單單介紹紙上的作品呢？中國以往的收藏家和鑑賞家，美學知識非常貧乏；有許多所謂名貴的作品，其實只是收藏家鑑賞家相互勾結的花樣，很少眞實的價値。御覽之寶更靠不住；乾隆所賞識的，自有許多大臣跟着贊頌一番；可是他所賞識的常是最壞的，一半由於他的低能，一半也由於他的專橫。書盡收藏家有一種通病：凡是自己所收藏的，便是天下最好的；雖說有許多作品，經過許多收藏家品題過，還是十二分不可信的。收藏家很少有歷史觀念，他們並不了解中國藝術發展的途徑，編排分類若不得當，使看者全得不什麼槪念。書畫部分排列的混亂，便足證明鑑賞家的審美能力了。</p>
<p>各室出品的排列，以中央研究院的考古物品選例為最精最有條理，顯然是出於考古專家之手。銅器部分的排列，也非常精當，考訂的工夫做得很細密；這足瞪明近三十年器物研究的進步。古書部分，不專重宋元版本，羅列各種刻本以及精鈔本，這是說明文化相的最好辦法；我們要佩服編排的人的卓識。自然囉，編排得最好的便是上海市民所最忽略的；我却不相信到倫敦以後，英國學術界會和上海的買辦們一樣顚倒本來的價値；銅器部分至少要給西方考古學家一些新的刺激！</p>

<h3 id="c170">昨日孫寒冰講　怎樣研究政治學 <a href="#c170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>昨為中國文化建設協會主辮之全國讀書運動大會第八日、該會特請孫寒冰講怎樣研究政治學、茲錄演詞如下、</p>
<p>對象與內容　諸位、今天承中國文化建設協會之邀請、到此演講怎樣研究政治學、現在很簡單的興各位談談、中國有一句古話、不在其位、不謀其政、其實這二旬話、在現在的中國、是小適宜的、假定每一個國民、對於國家政治如是消極、如是不負責任、國家政治如何介上軌道呢、現在的中國、是需要一般對於國家大事很負責很積極的公民、對國家大事要有責任、要有很積極的態度、那麼我們一般公民就得對於國家的情况、世界的大勢、要有充分的政治知識去理解他、研究他、所以研究政治、可以說現代人民應有的要求、具備的公民常識在講怎樣研究政治學的對象和內容究意怎樣的、要知道所謂政治二字的意義、是指人類的强制的支配關係或統治關係而言的一切社會中、物質上或智能上的强者、莫不欲使弱者順從他的意思、隸屬於他的權力之下、强者治人、弱者治於人、人類的政治生活是開始於統治者與被統治者之劃分而起的、這是鐵一般的事實、我們不能否認的、統治者在必要的時候、他可以用他的最高權力、採用監禁·放逐·處死等方法來貫澈他的政策、達到他的目的、他可以絕對不受他人之支配、不過統治者也次不能濫用其權力、也受着當時代的風俗習慣道德上種種的限制、在一定社會中、一個人或一羣人應用着他的權力統治着其餘的一部份人、我們統稱之為政治、所以政治學是研究人類之强制的統治關係或支配關係的社會科學、政治學的內容、大體可分三種、一是政治科學、二是政治竹、三是政治技術學、政治科學是研究人類過去和現在的政治生活、找出其因果的關係、和變遷的公律、政治學原理、政治史、政治思想史等、都屬於這政治科學、所謂政治哲學、是依據價値的判斷、綜合地探究政治現象之純理論之基礎和究竟、在普通政治學書籍中、往往把科學的研究、和哲學的議論混在一起、但在理論上、兩者是有很大的區別、政治技術是研究公共事務的實際組織、和治理以及達到特殊目的方法、例如行政學、政治政策學、均屬於這一類、所以具體說來、政治學所要解答的問題可以略舉如下、人類政治生活之互相關係、是怎樣的、人類政治生活之組織叫做國家的竟究是什麼、是不是世界上所有人類、不論其人種·信仰、文化程度都有各種類似的政治團體之組織、如果有的、那麼這種政治組織普遍存在的原因是什麼、國家的發生和進化、治者與被治者的關係、政府的組織及其職務等、都是倂究政治事者必須研究的問題、</p>
<p>研究的方法　一般的研究方法、不外採用科學方法、所謂科學方法、就是演綵法和歸納法、普通的人往往把這兩種方法看做不能並用的、其實這是謬誤見解、要知道研究的方法、實際祗有一種、分三個步驟、一是事實的觀察、二是假設的建立、三是把觀察的事實和建立的假設互相參證、是否符合、不過這是一般的研究方法、可適用社會科學、亦可適用自然科學、甚至做人方法、亦可應用、不過研究專門學術、應有專門的方法、所謂技術的方法、研究政治學的專門方法、現在分述如下、第一是觀察的方法、觀察是科學研究的基礎、是站在旁觀者地位、用客觀的態度、去觀察調查事物之實際情形、把觀察所得、加以紀載、然後予以種種整理、和分析的功夫、第二是統計的方法、就是用數量的形式來蒐羅·分析·和帶助說明社會事實的方法、統計方法雖不能為我們直接發見政治或社會現象的因果關係、然面他以極簡的、便於了解的數字形式、表明複雜的社會和政治的現象、確是研究社會科學者的一個重要而良好的工具、第三是比較的方法、就是研究當詩的或已往的各種政洽社會制度或生活、比較他們相同相與的地方、以求得普通確定的結論、第四是歷史的方法、就是從各種歷史的紀載中去搜羅關於所要研究事實的材料、歷史的方法非但可惟使我知道一種制度的起源、和發展的背景、而且可以供結我們許多參考的村料、來說明現在社會的現象、研究政治學的方法、大概如上述、總之研究的方法、是以題材之不同而相異、亦以人類研究的智慧與精神而日新月異的、</p>
<p>實踐的運用　不論何種學說、他的最高價値和最大目的、便在實踐、我們研究政治學的目的、便在如何可以使人類的政治生活合理化·美化·理想化·談到實踐、我們不能不注意到時間和空間的需要和限制、假定忘記時間和空間的支配、便是一個行不通的不可能的幻想、例如直接民權、他的本身的確是一個很好的制度、全民直接參加政治、不過這制度决不適用於任何一個國家、例如我們的中國、假定現在立刻實行直接民權、我深信直接民權的好處未見、沈弊必且百出、所以無論那一種科學、他的最高價値和最大目的、都在實踐、然而實踐的前提、我們不能忘記時間和空間的需要和支配、完了、</p>

<p>第一局　四時餘戰慕初展、楊樹浦隊先行開球、麥炳堯李錫　黃漢明三將、奪勇劈役、南敏隊慎重提防、未遭毒手、旋楊樹浦隊來球過猛、前排自殺負去一分、自後南敏劉志聰用命、成一與一、再後楊樹浦直上靑雲、以五與一佔先、南敏急急追上、成三對六、復後、楊樹浦鄭亦泉努力前進、成九對四之優勢、南敏運開三球、勢凶而猛、連增三分、成七比九、自後又經中排諸將之猛力格殺、造成九比九之平局、顧未幾卽被楊樹浦以十一對九佔先、易地再戰、南敏屢次殺球被對方嚴防、造成自殺、反使楊樹浦成十六對九優勢、南敏不甘示弱、屋着先鞭、成追至十三對十六、楊樹浦扶搖直上、結果以二十一對十四終局、楊樹浦奪取首局、</p>
<p>第二局　開球後、南敏力圖反攻、中排兩翼、相繼建功、前排之劉志聰、亦乘機欄壓、頃刻間以九對四領前、楊樹浦表衛二將、究係此中老手、聯絡進攻、分施奇能、追成十一對八相差僅三分耳、易地後、楊樹浦一鼓而下、反以十六對十四領前、入後南放雖曾一度復興、沉着應戰、比數增成二十對二十三平局、衛鼎　乃藉發球之機、獲得二分、楊樹浦遂以二十二對二十勝第二局、</p>
<p>第三局　南敏旣運失二局、乃抱破釜沉舟之志、聲勢汹汹、楊　浦雖係一時之精英、至此亦有英雄無用武地之嘆、後排沈爾昌王大純左右接濟、恰到妙處、前排金阿督劉志聰既無後顧之慮、乃大顯身手、劈殺扣球、百不失一、迨至十一對十換邊後、楊樹浦亡命追趕、反以十三對十一佔先、而南敏進攻亦烈、比數此上彼下、始終接近、南敏卒賴金劉馮等之壓設、以二十二對二十扳回一局、</p>
<p>第四局　開始後、楊樹浦先得一分、南敏之金馮即大顯神通、祇見其兔起鶻落、翻騰播擊達得三分、楊樹浦麥炳　騰身一擊、衛鼎彝鐵臂舉處、着着立功、反以五對三佔一先、南敏自十一對十奪得換邊後、楊樹浦乃聚精會神、麥衛一扣一殺、均建功而返、南敏形勢、大有江河日下之慨、結果以二十一對十八極接近之比數而受挫、</p>

<p>昨日朱寬與却克令、相逢上海公開手球單打賽中、極盡緊張之能事、大戰三局、方分勝負、初朱寬連以急猛之供球、壓迫對方、一度進展至十二對一之極大距離、繼却氏亦報以看家本領、但其結果、朱寬以二十一比十二勝第一局、視之似不甚費力也、第二局形勢大變、朱氏氣喘殊甚、進退失其依據、却克令則扶搖直上、一如朱寬在第一局時之神色、而其勝利之婦却、毫無疑慮、比數為二十一對八、第三局為勝負關鈕、二人全神灌注、一球得失、恒經幾多變化而定奪、朱寬精神奮發、在在表現其佳妙技藝、却氏雖猛勇過人、終受朱寬按制、難逃失敗之例、結果、朱寬又以二十一比十三勝第三局、本屆錦標、朱寬依然在握、似無第二人與之逐鹿矣、</p>

<p>又，那些娘姨大姐們在菜市用三幾個銅子，從鄉下人那裏買來整籃的靑菜，可曾知道這就是「農村破產」？</p>
<p>有些人看見別個買到一樣極廉價的東西，便贊羨之不遺餘力，你可曾知道他應用起來時的失效次數？以及這東西的短暫的壽命？是以「便宜」之呼聲未完，「上當」的嘆息和咒詛便繼之而起了。</p>
<p>由此而論，可知「便宜」這回事，是片面的，不能兩全其美的，有一方面便宜，終有一方面吃虧，這是自然之理。</p>
<p>榻便宜究竟是人人願的，也要有個分寸；你可切勿學那獃老二，討了老婆五個月便養起小娃娃來却到處向人說是便宜纔好呢！</p>

<p>— 陳警愚</p>
<p>申先生，是一位獃氣十足的朋友；因此做起事來，時有一種匪夷所思的見解，和生面別開的花樣。</p>
<p>它本富有資財，常常恐被盜匪覬覦，乃千方百計，想得一個「僵李代桃」的法子。馬上買了好多厚洋紙，併作三五十張一疊，切成像各銀行一元，五元，十元的各種鈔票一樣大小，上面加上一張眞鈔票，用繩子逐一綑紮，邊緣再以髒水染汚，俾與舊鈔票的顏色一般無二；然後一疊疊地收藏在保險箱裏，以備不虞。它自詡是神出鬼沒的奇謀，雖「臥龍」復生，不過如此。</p>
<p>鴉片烟是它唯一的嗜好，天天總要抽上幾口；然而時往烟館裏跑，覺得不便。於是自購烟土，呌人給它熬煮，無如苦於無灰；因爲熬烟而少了烟灰，熬好下來，非但成色不佳，並且淡而無味。它沉思有頃，掉臂逕入，移時，欣然携一紙裏出，嚷着：「烟灰有了！」實則這所謂烟灰，絕似一塊燒焦的木炭，係用烟土放在火上烤炙成功。問它：「怎不索性一同煮作淸膏，何必將它糟掉」？則曰：「那末還是沒有烟灰啊！」其人爲之絕倒！</p>
<p>新近，它忽想起戒烟，遂將一部「本草」，前後翻徧，選了幾樣潤滑腸胃的藥品，拿來煎膏冲服。以爲戒烟重在泄瀉，一經下達，則積滯腹中的烟漬，定能袪除凈盡，烟癮自會消滅無遺！不料服藥以後，頓如黃河决口般的大瀉不止，幾乎憊不能支；幸仍用烟醫治，才算轉危爲安。從此它的癮量，却轉益加深一層了！</p>

<p>細雨霏霏，催長樹頭新綠，芳草一碧，彌望無垠，春郊景物，又是一番精神。</p>
<p>淸明之晨，有中年夫婦，執一束鮮花，步武麥隴間，抵一塚，揷花墳頭，低徊不忍遽去，戚傷之餘，歎息頻聞。俄婦舉目遠矚，遙覩有持楮帛老婦，徘徊路側，若失途尋徑者然，忽亦取道而前，細辨之，果曾相識，乃亟牽夫衣曰：易去休，彼婦來矣。躊躇間，老婦至，面色慘白，似相頷首，但不語，側身趨墳前，初尙嗚咽，繼竟號啕，聲聞遠近，悲悽不勝，夫亦爲之揮淚。婦現不耐色曰：去休，去休，奴其先行矣。夫不顧，且攙老婦起，北弗悲，老婦哭益勁，移時，聲嘶力盡，始起焚帛，餘哀猶未息也。時先來之婦已含怒行，男子不忍去，頻向老家慰藉曰：逝者如斯，且寳己軀，莫爲短命人過事傷心。老婦含哀未理，拂拭紅眼，偃僂而行，且行且回頭、依依不忍別，男子尾隨送之，至歧途始別。</p>
<p>十年前，彼老婦人卽男之妻，育一子，絕慧，兒年十四，卒業初中，時夫有外遇，棄家不顧卒離異，兒隨父去，輒乘隙過母，且慰之曰：母母悲，兒他日能自立，卽當迎養，婦以手工自活，閱數年，兒就職某廠，方期積儲成家，忽一二八事變發生，憤敵無理，加入義軍參戰，不幸飲彈死。戰平，父爲卜葬於斯，母初不之知，後聞耗，生意頓絕，哭失聲，恨未悉埋尸所在，四出探問，莫知究竟。年來憂傷抑鬱。憔悴益甚，比始知埋骨東郊，乃於淸明日尋蹤哭奠，竟能重逢故劍，巧遇情敵，重重傷心，益覺堪憐矣。</p>

<p>— 朱</p>
<p>牙齒，是咀嚼食物主要的武器；食物的是否嚼爛，與消化八有關係。牙齒的健全　否，關係着人生健康，所以口腔衛生，保護牙齒，是一項重要項目。</p>
<p>然而我的牙齒，說也慘然，已大半出了毛病；不是蛀蝕，定是殘缺，雖東補西嵌，可是那種裝着的假齒，終究不及自己的有用，不是不舒適，定是用不得勁；不要說硬的東西，不能咀嚼，就是嫩筍等食品，吃起來也要特別當心，否則假牙一挫，一陣酸麻，直透心頭，酸痛得簡實要墮下淚來。</p>
<p>我心愛吃的花生等食物，祇好看着別人吃得怪有滋味，自己除了空咽口涎，委實無福消受，有時買些果酥可是吃在嘴裏，那裏有吃花生的香脆可口。一個三十多歲的人，早巳視茫茫，髮蒼蒼，齒牙豁落，道地做成了個老成少年：自己想來，眞覺又是可笑，又是可嘆！</p>
<p>我牙齒脫落的最大原因，就因爲從小喜歡吃糖，而我的父母，對於我牙齒衛生，又太不經心；直到我在十一二歲，由家熟改進小學，方才用牙刷刷牙漱口，然而我一口牙齒，早已零亂焦黑，不很健全；有時牙齒痛起來，痛得飯米不進，面孔腫腫的，幾天幾夜不得好睡。所以我一滿廿歲，兩邊的牙齒，早已蛀去了四五隻，在上下排列的牙齒間，開了幾多窟窿。</p>
<p>因着一個友朋，在牙醫生處當助手，他見了牙齒脫落，就慫恿我去裝金齒，並且價錢可以特別克己。我經他的慫患，就到那牙醫室中去鑲裝，因左面的兩隻犬牙脫落，先裝三隻，一隻是套在旁邊牙上的殼子，一隻金齒，一隻磁齒，共鑲裝三隻假齒，裝時先把一種紅的粉，印了牙齒的模型，然後再去鑲裝，在鑲裝的當兒，將牙齒用車床挫了再挫，一陣陣的震動，震得牙齒酸麻，一股焦辣的火辣氣味，直透咽喉，眞使我十分難堪。</p>
<p>裝好的牙齒，朋友把賬交下，竟要十六塊錢，這數目眞使我大吃一驚，後來講好講歹，我發恨了，請他把裝好的牙齒拔下，方才出了幾塊錢了事。然而一個朋友，竟因此而宣吿絕交。</p>
<p>我經了這次敎訓，牙齒聽他蛀蝕，不敢再裝金牙。可是在去年底，因嚼一個橄欖，用力一咬，門牙竟嚼下半爿；張開口來，七豁八洞，委實太難堪了，不能不再去鑲裝。於是和內人在牛角濱裝牙的幾家小店中，講來講去，在天記鑲牙店裏鑲了五隻金齒，一隻磁齒，共計大洋八元。價錢確乎便宜，不過不大舒適。張開嘴來，巳再不見窟窿，然而這種强裝的鬥面，終究不合實用，深深感到保護牙齒，眞是人生要事，尤其應在童年時代注意起！</p>

<p>他所住的房子，在這裏，也可說是頭等房間了，可是他自己走開，並不怕人睡髒了他的被褥，也不怕人偷他的東西。於是向月英道：你就是這樣到前面去，恐怕賈老爺那床，也不肯讓你睡。難得這位先生的好意，你就去把濕衣服脫了下來罷。我自會到賈老爺那裏去和你說的。於是楊浣花向前面賈多才去回信。胡嫂子將月英送到志前屋子裏去。茶房同胡嫂子本是熟人，這又有志前當面交代過，落得做個好人。所以毫不干涉，　讓他們走到屋子裏去了。月英一身水淋淋的走進人家屋子，身上是不是冷，這且不去理會，只覺上下雨排牙齒，吱咯吱咯，整個兒厮打。胡嫂子看了他這週身打顫，也是有些不忍，於是帮同着他解了衣扣，就放下志前的帳子。月英走到帳子裏去，把全身鞋襪衣服，一齊都脫乾淨了。展開了棉被，人就向裏面一鑽。自然，他是將全身捲得緊緊的，然而身上是雨水冰久了，元自抖顫個不了。胡嫂子將他脫下來的衣服鞋襪，捲成了一大捲，於是向他道，你好好的在這床上舒服一會子罷，我把這些東西拿去烘烤。我把門朝外扣上，別人也就不會進來的了。（一八四）</p>

<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>雖然伊們决非都在同時做着刺繡的工作、也許有的是在打樣：　有的是在配底：不過這一方貢緞上的花朵，旣已指定着這個人刺繡，這個人便遲早總得負責去完成它。每一方　緞更不是專爲做一雙鞋面，往往是五六雙合在一起的：因此，這方貢緞的上下左右，幾乎是滿佈着應繡的花樣了。每個女工便各自低下了頭，——伊們的頭必須是俯得很低的，差不多要把伊們的眼睛貼在那貢緞上了；因爲這種工程委實是極精細的、倘不這樣看得眞切，便難免要錯誤了。——一聲不發地挑繡着。</p>
<p>現在待我將伊們的工作程序，說得此較詳細一些：第一步、伊們先依照了那些已畫就的鞋樣，在那貢緞上用白粉勾出幾隻鞋面的輸廓來，每兩隻之間，當然必須留些空白，以便裁割：鞋面的輪廓一起勾好，第二步便得一隻一隻的刺繡起來。不過在刺繡每一隻鞋面之前，還一部份預備的工夫。譬如這一隻鞋面上需要一枝梅花，那末伊就應該先用一種很薄的白紙剪出幾朶形態各別的梅花來、再把這幾朶紙花放到那貢緞上所畫着的一隻鞋面上去，這邊試試，那邊又試試，用藝術的眼光來决定它們應佔的適當的部位；部位旣定，然後用絲綫來把它們釘起來。這時候所用的絲綫，大槪都是白的而且不須釘多少針數，只求將那紙花釘住便行了。（二九四）</p>

<p>— 戅</p>
<p>窰子裏有帶當娘姨，現在學校裏有帶當教員，眞是花樣翻新，愈弄愈奇了。</p>
<p>窰子裏的帶當娘姨，據說，她們帶有一二們小姐，這樣小姐做生意所賺的錢，本家和娘姨是拆賬的，所以這種娘姨，十分寫意，午後或晚間，不是在幾個大書場裏聽聽書，理是和幾位熟客打打麻雀，所以這種帶當娘姨，生活很爲舒適。</p>
<p>那曉得現號稱東方紐約的上海，敎育界中，還有帶當敎員的一件事，據昨日報載，海門人黃康生，向在浙江永康地方敎讀，本年春，經人介紹，在滬延平路民華職業中學當地理歷史敎員，當時與該校蔡校長言明，黃於永康能帶來學生五十餘名，而薪水則須較他教員爲優，故由蔡允按月給黃薪金五十元，較其他敎員高二十元也。</p>
<p>現在我替該校長算算這篇賬，這椿生意，着實做的過，據說該校學生，每學期學膳宿三費，每人須六十元，倘以五十學生計算，每學期須收入三千元，一年有六千元的收入，卽使該教員每月多送二十元，則每年如以十二月計算，亦僅二百四十元，當有五千七百六十元之贏餘，其中若再去學生膳宿等費，約三千元，當有二千七百餘元的純益，這票生意算算實做得過。</p>
<p>可惜該敎員，一則能力薄弱，五十餘們學生之數，打了大大的折扣，二則設心不良，又侵佔了學費三百十五元，這樣打了兩重折扣，該校長利益無幾，天然大光其火，要提起訴訟，一本千他侵占了，這種滬上學界的臭歷史，簡　聞所未聞，</p>
<p>不過滬上開設的學店，真是很多，有的收了學費，並不開學，有的僅有科目，而沒有敎員的，有試敎一年，再來聘定的，其中五花八門，神出鬼沒的技倆，實屬書不勝書，則帶當敎員，安知不是學店老闆一件生財的道呢，假定每　—　個學堂，有如黃敎員者十人，到年底結算結算，眞是要喜透顏開里。</p>

<p>— 容</p>
<p>這幾天黃昏時分，走過靜安寺路西摩路口而將轉向自己寓所去的時候，我往往是被那鮮艷動人的花房吸引住了，抽着和平的捲烟，在植着西洋梧桐的瀝青鋪道上站了一會，出其不意的陣陣花香便隨着夕暮之微風吹送到鼻觀中來，從車水馬龍萬家燈火的馬路那邊回過頭來，映入眼瞼的是那千紅萬紫的明明的窗。斑爛的色調正如一幅古錦，妖冶的舞姬樣的桃花，淡淡的哲人風度的素　花，凄楚的如一個怨女那麽凝望著的丁香，瘦而清秧的紫荊，宜於婚禮筵上的或垂著紫綢窗帷邊的加乃馨，以及許多千奇百怪的雜花異卉，都呈媚鬥艷地堆在你的眼前，看那情形，真使你忘記了是自身在囂雜的城市，而竟是置身於一個璀璨的四月天的花圃裏，如果那窗內再映著雪亮的，添上幾個商人氣較少的人，真給你醖出一種離奇的纏綿的情調。</p>
<p>站在那裏，靜靜爲花香所侵襲，眼前是各樣溫雅的色調，淡的緋色，深紫或淺紫，鮮潤如翡翠的綠色裏配上幾點娟娟的白點，素樸的背景中點綴上小血珠樣的猩紅，還有象徵著高尙希望的黃，只沒有黑與灰，在青天那種色調是沒份的。這些花枝都沒經過十分的剪裁，疎野自然的情趣，正如小橋流水間籬落的姑娘，不像城市間的女子那麽熱得熾得令你發燥，又不像舊式的閨閣淑媛那麽冷冰冰地凍得你發寒，如一盞綠酒，在淺斟低酌中給你一種平和的快慰，雖然那地方沒有什麼碧波和燕羽，但面對着這些花朶，你已可知道這就是春天了。</p>
<p>而且，而且這正是細雨霏微的季節，因了雨，什麽都鍍上一層哀怨的色彩，車聲，人語聲，賣晚報聲，雖然響亮，但這時純是無力的。夕霧中的街，雨絲中的紅綠交通燈和廣告書，和這些花映帶起來，全是値得迷戀的。花房內永遠是晴天，而且是幻夢般的四月的晴天，馥郁而芬芳，如一首修長的戀歌。在這裏沒有戰爭，沒有血，沒有利祿的爭逐，沒有太息與眼淚，一切都埋沉在一股溫和的希望裏，</p>
<p>站在外面看已給人以官能以上的滿足，若推開門進去時，那情形又兩樣了，一個人彷彿降生了衆香國裏，香薰薰的暖氣包住你的全身，虹霞般的色彩伺候在你四周，柔和如一個新婚的夜，前面的愛嬌的表情，旁邊是膩香的錦幔和</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>雅緻的流蘇，不由你不心醉。我記得有一家花店內養着一隻小小的金絲雀，笙簧似的雅樂直透過那玻窗，散自那靑靑的樹蔭間而消逝，和着那股奇香，那片艷麗的顏色，就像是段令人惘然的甜甜的夢境。</p>
<p>回去的時候，也往往買上那麽一兩束花朵，這花朶伴着我瘦長而孤獨的影子穿過大路，走向靜僻的件宅區，而進了寓所；我把這束花放進瓶裏，位置到那幾本古老莊嚴的哲學書旁邊，正如妙齡的女郞依傍着慈祥的老祖父，黑了燈，靜寂中就有書的香與花的香。現在花已開始凋謝了，我在執筆的時候看到那麽一兩朵董紫色的憔悴的影子、似乎在無限惋傷地玲惜她過去的華年！</p>
<h3 id="c211">墟船上 <a href="#c211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— 天麒</p>
<p>—南歸散記—</p>
<p>東方微微發白的時候，船夫高聲　喊了一聲　　「　　　」　　　　　　分重的墟船，擺搖了一下就慢慢的向江心蕩開去了。江面上，濛漫着輕軟的晨霧；淡靑的江水輕輕地打着船頭靜謐里，南岸山下已飛起婦女喚渡的長聲。回顧淞市臨江一帶的店屋的後影也漸漸地模糊在烟霧里。</p>
<p>空洞洞的船蓬內，僅有我一個搭客，無形中加厚了心頭寂寞的孤感。據我所知往常普通一條墟船至少也有二三十個搭客擠得蜂窩似地，現在這異乎常態的情形，不由不使我驚怪了，而且很快的轉爲恐怖。一幕從小說上看過的舟子謀財害命的恐怖的想像，若卽若離的粘膩在心頭，於是又後悔不該這樣造次來搭墟船了。</p>
<p>船上共有五個舟人，四個在船頭撑篙，把舵的是個五十開外年紀的老人，粗黑的皮膚上，明顯地塗抹下他幾十年的風霜雪月；一股憂挹的又是莫可奈何的　　，時時會偷空浮在濃而粗黑的眉頭，無形中加强了他的蒼老。不過對那嵌在濃眉下的眼珠子，可還煥發着一股堅强的和善的光輝，這光輝，說明他幷不會灰心於他的事業，以及他這個人是怎樣一個善良的人。</p>
<p>我的坐位是後艙蓬內，和這個老人正打個照面。兩人就很容易交談起來。經了一番交談後，先前的疑慮也完全消失了，因爲他已吿訴我他就是這船的船主，而且還是白馬村的同姓叔侄。</p>
<p>因爲是同姓關係，說話也就親切了許多了。這時候船剛剛走到一個轉彎的堤峽，水勢湍急起來，他一邊全神灌注船頭的水勢，兩手緊緊的押着舵桿，一邊就吁喘着氣斷斷續續的吿訴我鄕里的情况，是怎樣一天一天很難來着；自從縣淞公路通車以後，所有墟船又怎樣加上了致命的打擊。</p>
<p>—墟客呢，他們做小生意的難道也，出得起比搭船多兩倍的車錢嗎？</p>
<p>—老侄台，汝剛回來的人那里會曉得。起初我們也不過少了一批過往客子罷了，不料那老沒良心的車公司不久就說什麼優待墟客，凡是墟客搭車的只要出三分一的車錢，這個樣子一來誰不樂得去搭車呀！</p>
<p>—老侄台，我說句蠢話，俄看而今世界只有更逼死我們窮苦人罷了！對不對？哈哈哈哈！</p>
<p>他的笑顯然是莫可奈何的無聊的自慰，正如擺在眼前的命運雖然已殘酷地打擊碎他的一切努力，但爲了飢餓，爲了生的延續和伸展，結果還是要檱風沐雨地在絕望中求生存，不能就此灰心，枯坐而斃一樣。不過他雖然想用笑來掩蓋他內心的楚痛，而在我看來可簡直比看看他哭還難過了。</p>
<p>我沒有說一句話，只痴痴的目送着悠悠往後移去的山崗，堤岸，樹林……這時太陽已高高的吊在山頭暑船頭的舟人也正肉漲筋暴的發出拖海的堅忍的號呌，逆着水流，一篙一篙的把船撑向橫在前頭不遠的險惡難渡的石門灘……</p>

<p>雄鷄在亞答屋後的鷄籠里喔喔地啼着，太陽像火盆似的從蒙上一層輕紗的展霧椰林里鑽出來，巴里的人聲、牲畜聲，……雜烘烘的已經漸漸地喧騰熱鬧起來了。這時，黃順之兄弟倆，從床上爬起來，照例的「涼」也不「冲」了，忙亂地整束着他們簡單的行李，草草的吃過早餐，辭別他的「頭家」，同時又是至親的族伯河淸，出了店門、趁者早車前往網谷。</p>
<p>河淸伯送他們兄弟倆出了店門，緊拉着他們倆的粗糙的手膊，吐着像心底裏的鮮紅的血塊似的眞犖的語言：</p>
<p>「順之姪，不是伯伯不讓你們兄弟倆在店裏住，委實店裏的生意，最近已變淸淡得可憐了！照這樣的情形下去，前途是萬分的悲觀，說不定再過兩三個月，伯伯的店將會無法維持而倒閉了。……你們都是年靑吃得苦頭的小伙子，在這裏株守也不是萬全的辦法兒，應當到外面去苦幹才有希望！……」河淸伯的沉重的聲音顫抖着，眼眶裏濕潤潤了。</p>
<p>順之兄弟倆低着腦袋唔唔的回腔，隨後便邁着脚步離開了。</p>
<p>一直等到他們兄弟倆的影子在街心中消逝了，河淸伯才慢條斯理地走進了他的雜貨店。</p>
<p>「倘使是幾年前的話，店裏就再多幾個人來住，來帶食，也是不打緊的。那時的生意是多麽興降旺盛的啊！店裏雇用了十幾個夥計，一天還是忙亂得遍身流着臭汗，沒有一個時候有空閒。誰個能逆料到現在，生意會變得這樣的蕭條，淡清，連吃飯的問題，也會發生恐慌了！一河清伯的心底裏　暗暗地在嘆氣，越想心裏越不自在，精神像過度的勞動之後的疲偡，身卅。他把屁股移到靠近賑櫃邊的矮凳子上，隨手在賑櫃上摸出他的旱煙筒，裝上了煙絲，閉著眼睛，吱吱地抽着。</p>
<p>河淸伯是一個誠實忠厚約莫五十多歲的老番，自到番邦來，一向就在這山巴裏開設這　「源記」的雜貨店，專門做土人的買賣，同時，並收買土人的穀子，大批的運出網谷賣給礱米的「米較」去，然後，再把賺來的錢，在網谷購配大批的日用品，運進山巴來賣給土人。</p>
<p>現在土人已不像從前般的愚笨了，他們知道了做買賣，而且，政府又在山巴裏　裏自己開設販頁局，按照一定的價格來收買土人的穀子，並嚴懲土人廉價的把穀子售與粟商。這一來，可把河淸伯的生意搶得乾乾凈凈了。</p>
<p>最近政府又派着公人到街上來調查各商店的營業和資本，據說不久就要實行徵收「營業稅」了。</p>
<p>「這年頭，生意眞個不容易做了！去年徵收孓什麼「所得捐，」現在又來個「營業稅，」市情又一天一天地冷落，捐稅却把人壓得抬不起頭兒！」河淸伯的旱烟筒在地上咯咯地敲着，心裏好難過地嘮叨着。</p>
<p>「也許順之兄弟倆到網谷之後，朋友們背地裏會對他譏誚着「連子姪也容留不住」的誰堪入耳的閒話來，然而，這年頭的商情誰個會不感到困難，何况我這爿店子，委實已有點岌岌地維持不住了！……」</p>
<p>當河淸伯張開他的深陷得像兩個窟窿的眼睛，看見店堂裏的稀稀的貨欵，和像午後般的沉寂，不曾走上來一個把顧客，他的蘊藏在心裏的二十幾年前的「渡「番邦」，拾金子」的美夢，給打破得粉碎了。</p>

<p>到包家口的時候，不意地又見到那個脫光了頭髮的趕騾子的老禿了什麽都是一個樣子：那城牆，那河，那地上的刺脚的砂石。不同的，祇是老秃的縐臉比以前更縐，更枯黑，更萎縮得可怕了，而那曾爲他誇過口的，每天能走五十里來砂路的結實的腿子，也失去了當年的壯健的姿態：還有，那勞瘁過度，而食料却過少，豎耳朶的黑騾子（我們記得還只有五歲呢）、，也跟着垂倒了頭，有氣無力的拖着四條再也不能飛奔的灣腿，而把那不善於沈思的蠢腦子沈到過往的追憶中去了。</p>
<p>（但是一切都仍是一個樣子啊！那山，那樹，那每天掛在黃昏之城頭上的落日！）</p>
<p>人走近的時候，老禿却也從空洞的沈思裏抬起頭來啦，一眼看見了我們，在驚呆中，一絲微笑却像閃電似的通過了老臉上的數不淸的縐紋，微笑爬上了老禿的給六十多年的苦生活壓傷了的臉，正像連年冰雪的荒島上照來了一絲陽光似的，縱然微弱，也許會融解開一小塊的有着無邊的酷寒的冰屑吧？</p>
<p>「啊哈！好爺們，貴爺們，你多好，多得意吧？哈，看樣子也眞的發福得多啦！」聲音是啞的，燥的，雖然要做得自然一點，年靑一點，硬朗一點，但這可是不容易的事啊。</p>
<p>大家都有着一個異樣的感覺，看看老禿，看看騾子，却全失去了先前的活氣了，生活的暴力把人向脆薄的死亡冰河推去，而如今是，人和畜生都給推到死亡的邊綫上了。</p>
<p>「老禿，你也老了啊。」</p>
<p>「啊，我的爺們：老了？是的，老了倒也吧了，勞碌命啊，不老也是受苦，跟牲畜一個樣子，老了倒也，倒也……苦了的是這畜生啊！」</p>
<p>對的，我想起了：老禿還沒有變，老禿可仍是把那只黑騾子當作朋友一樣的呢。</p>
<p>先一些時候，我們在包家口的一個小村子裏住過一個夏天，我們是帶了一些夏令應用的便宜藥材到這兒來做買賣的，落了店，爲了那地方的路全是砂子，大太陽晒着，會像燒紅了的鐵塊一樣熱的，在這樣的情形裏，走路可不是容易的事啊。那麼着，我們便决計託店夥找一個老誠一點的騾夫，着包他一個月的騾子。店夥呌來的是老禿，說：人是挺結實，挺靠得住的，牲畜又强，人又沒有家，儘可跟着客人天南地北的走。</p>
<p>這樣，便跟老禿打起交道來了。</p>
<p>雖然說，老禿的稀少的，幾乎是光禿的鬢髮已經是灰白了，但人可沒有現在那樣的萎瘁，趕起路來也來得，而特別呌人奇怪的是，他對那唯一的騾子却存着特別的好意，別說自已從不肯打牠一下，就是客人虐待了牠，老禿也一定會抖着聲音說的：「爺們，慈悲吧，畜牲也是勞碌命啊…」</p>
<p>「老禿，你倒是怪好的呢。」</p>
<p>「喝大先生，你不知道，三年的打仗，媽也死了，爹也死了，老家也沒了，自家兒浪了出去，可就祇剩了這跟我一樣苦的牲口了呢。人跟牲口一樣，也是勞碌命啊…」</p>
<p>「勞碌命」三個字打饗了人的憂思；它，彷彿暗示着一個人的可怕的命運一樣的，帶着一個同樣蓬勃的生命，人在世界上走，經過山，經過海，而有的人就不得不命定地掉到深不見底的褐色之勞瘁的坑裏去了，永永地。</p>
<p>而如今是，應該輪到另外一些人和畜生來徘徊在永久是勞瘁的褐色的死亡綫上了。</p>

<p>— 胡思衷</p>
<p>已經達到橋的對岸了：身子已安置在馬來聯邦的國士。一道關稅閃在眼前，馬　警察向着我們略一瞥視，便讓給這過了。一踏入柔佛的國土，柔佛王府便在一個山間閃現出來。王府上升起了月旗，一圈竹籬把這雄壯的建築物圍繞起來。柔佛的都市又開展着光滑的栢油馬路，和熱哄哄的市聲，以及商店的喧鬧。電燈光又在閃眼，汽車又在擁擠，都市的形態又顯在眼前了。</p>
<p>一大羣走到飯館裏去吃飯，夜晚的熱帶人的精神是旣淸醒而又歡快的。大家常常歡笑起來。</p>
<p>飯後立又主張到柔佛海濱乘凉和看夜景，便把車子又駛到掛近鐵橋的海濱。大家揀着裝設在海濱準備給遊人的椅子坐下，看見月亮已斜斜地掛在天上。一道迷茫的月光照在大海，顯出大海的胸懷是旣廣大而又明亮，比着日裏的粗惡，更饒有待味。鐵橋在夜晚更顯出長遠，對岸叢林的黑影子，更顯得糢糊。只有一片像水晶般的灰白色，在遠遠處罩蓋起來。在月光下，成串的汽車和成行的電燈，更比傍晚時顯得越加美麗。海風把我們吹開了胸襟，有的人更在椅上躺臥起來。</p>
<p>「多麽美麗的天天呵，無怪柔佛國王要變成個風流天子呢！」明說。</p>
<p>「我願死在柔佛海峽的海水裏面呢」！立　和若說。</p>
<p>得大家都業起來，預備把他推進海裏去。</p>
<p>一直過了一二個鐘頭，看大家的心已被美景浸飽，而岸上的遊人也漸漸稀疏，海水的響聲從市聲的低沉間漸漸響起來，我們只好走了。</p>
<p>車開足速率從鐵橋上爬過，身心都歡躍得異常舒適。又爬過了荒僻的獅島郊外，於是從市梢又進入了市心。新加坡的汚濁和喧噪又接觸着我們了。</p>
<p>「呵，多麼討厭的新加坡呵！」大家都嘆着說，似乎對於遺棄了柔佛的鐵橋和海濱，感到了很大的抱憾似的。（完）</p>

<h3 id="c218">梅琪伊文斯所說她不願做女明星的理由（上） <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 新尼</p>
<p>當一個女演員，公開的說她不願意做明星的話，她一定要巳經有明星的地位。不然，那　話是毫無意味的。梅琪伊文斯（Maage　Evans），她就是說這句話的人，是「塊肉餘生」中的　　之一，飾着大衛考伯菲而的後妻愛尼司。她說：「我不願意做明星」。她並不是做不到明　　望梅解渴，聊以解嘲的話，亦不是要藉此標榜，自吹法螺的話。她是很有理由，很有見地的。</p>
<p>她說：「人聽了我的話就要說：「又來了，又來自已宣傳了」，便是在我自己，這却是很自然，很有道理的感想。我不得不詳細的說明我的理由。我想好萊塢的人物，各色俱備，是，個學習價値比較，再好沒有的地方了。當我自己問着自己，要不要自己的名字，用燦爛的燈光裝飾着，橫列在空際，比其他一切人的名宇還要大的時候，我就向四週審視一下子。</p>
<p>「譬如說，從前這裏有一個『那個的女子』（"I"Girl）。她是一位明星。她從一早自床上　身之後，『那個』就統治了她全部的生活，直到她睡到了床上爲止。大衆要求『那個』，他們化了錢去看『那個』，他們一定要得到『那個』。我覺得『那個』簡直是非人生活了。那種緊張的生活！那個『那個的女子』，非但對於他的觀衆，並且對於她的朋友，僕役，新聞記者，公司當局，導演，協肉的，賣麵包約，處處都要證實她確實是有『那個』的。</p>
<p>「你再看看葛萊泰嘉寳。我很佩服她，承認她是一位大藝術家。但是倘使有人呌我，爲她那明星的地位而奮鬥，我却覺得很犯不着。我想她對於那副黑眼鏡，一定是很厭倦的了。我想她一定會常常爲做明星而自恨，因爲她做了明星，却失去了她的自由，走到隨便什麼地方，都要化妝一下，躱避一般人的耳目，惟恐被人家偵察出來。</p>
<p>「並且一個女演員旣做了明星之後，她的起居飲食交際等等，亦一定要按照着明星的地位和榮譽去安排起來。就是瑙瑪希拉，瓊克勞馥，康絲登裴湼，瑪琳黛維絲—她們是很實在的女子——亦不能不將她的精神集中了，時時刻要顧到自己的地位和榮譽。這樣她們就永遠沒有逍遙自在的餘暇了。她們一定要住華美的大洋房。她們一定要穿得美麗入時。她們一定要僱用許多僕役。她們的汽車一定要簇新富麗。她們還要置備珍飾，珍貴的皮衣，養名種的狗，還要家裏有花園，游泳池，網球塲，以及其他的一切奢侈品。她們是明星，而這些東西又是大衆所期望於明星們的。</p>
<p>「以上所提到的四位女明星，她們都已經有了相當的地位與威望，似乎可以用不着遵守那種影城的不成文法了，但是她們却辦不到。明星與明星之間，照舊的要競爭。一切飲食，起居，服用，交際，都要窮奢極慾，才可證明及維持她們的聲望。這種情形現在比從前好些了，但是習俗是很難改的。她們還一定要互相比擬著，誰的房子華美，誰的花園精雅，誰的汽車，或遊艇値錢，誰有最多的鑽鐲。這就是我所以不喜歡做明星的又一個原因。</p>
<p>「倘使我僅是一個特等演員，而不是明星，我儘管簡單些的生活著。我現在和我的母親兄弟，同住在一所租來的房子裏，而我的生活，和一位普通美國女子的生活，是沒有多大分別的。我天天工作是很緊張的，但是在我不工作的時候，我可以自由行動，看看書，游泳，望望女朋友，出去玩玩。不怕人家來窺伺我，麻煩我，不致引起好奇者的注意。</p>
<p>「我很少參加宴會，因此我亦用不到多少套的晚服。我並沒有想到購買遊艇。如果有了，我反覺得沒有法子用它了。我亦不想定製特別的汽車，因為一輛普通的汽車，是够我需要的了。我不用應酬導演，敷衍製片家，或連絡影星們，所以我亦不用花園房子，游泳池，網球塲，以及衆多的僕役。但是如果我是一位明星，那就不能這樣簡單了。</p>
<p>這都是我不願做明星的理由，但是還不僅是以上所說的幾個理由。（未完）</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c219">評「海底大路」 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>Under　Pressure　—大光明</p>
<p>不久，在大光明看到「海底大路」的預告片，那緊張的塲面，那優秀的攝影，使我懷着熱烈的心，等候這一影片開映。可是現在我却失望了。以前熱望換來了無限的空虛。「海底大路」不是一部成功的作品。</p>
<p>屬於技術方面，我不能不承認攝影是還可以看看的，由於攝影的黑白鮮明，幷助粗獷的氣氛不少。但是導演却一次又一次的耗費膠片在築路方面，老是築路，老是矯揉造作的緊張，這給與人們沉滯而單純的感覺。我不知道導演者是否很有這海底築路的經騐，可是我總覺着這和實際情形大槪相差很遠，至少他不能運用純熱的電影技術的傳達眞實感。可喜的是工人薩克的個性可愛。對於麥克勞倫的演戲的姿態，我們是很熟悉的了。</p>
<p>對於一部影片成功與失敗的估價，自然不能僅由導演或表演的技術來作爲繩準。劇本害了導演，乃是常有的事。是的「海底大路」的失敗，正是劇作者對於社會現實庸俗的理解，以及在技術上也是低能的表現。</p>
<p>假使說這一影片也有主題，那便是以金錢作爲榮譽的估價，使工人們拚命的築路，以性命來換得大量的金錢。我們能說這是正當的精神的鼓勵麽？相反的，正是物質的誘惑罷了。另一方面，我們却看到工人們金錢的爭奪起來，使工人之間分裂。這樣，正是美國電影爲現製度服役的精神之一貫的表現了。</p>
<h3 id="c220">西席地米爾為什麽要穿騎馬裝 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 東林</p>
<p>離今數年前，當電影界尙在默片時代，好萊塢的導演們都穿着短衫和騎馬袴，脚登長統靴到攝影塲來辦公的。所以當時騎馬裝竟成爲導演的制服似的，猶如攝影師是用打鳥帽反戴來區別一樣。可是跟着時代的遷移，這種習慣亦漸漸地消滅，到現在可說導演們完全都穿着平常的西裝到攝影塲來了。</p>
<p>然而，現在還有一個，依然還保持着「舊時代」的裝扮，那就是大導演西席地米爾！</p>
<p>地米爾一共有一打長統靴。他從來沒有接連兩天穿着一樣的足統靴到攝影塲來。而他的每雙長統靴還都有不同的短衫和騎馬袴來配合。他最喜歡穿的是黃褐色的騎馬袴和綠色的短衫。</p>
<p>在一年三百六十五日中，你沒有一天能够在攝影塲中看見地米爾穿着一九三五年型的西裝的！不！不管別的導演已都改變了服裝，西席地米爾仍舊穿着舊時的騎馬裝，厚牛皮的長統靴發出的答之聲，走到攝影塲來！</p>
<p>許多人疑問：爲什麽地米爾要穿騎馬裝呢？這位古怪的老導演就這樣地回答他道：　「這有兩個緣故：第一就是因爲我是個導演。至於第二個緣故呢，那是因爲平常的衣服决經不起做導演的這種激烈工作之人穿着的。而且穿着這騎馬裝我覺得非常舒服，無論你做怎樣粗暴的動作，亦不必擔心它是否會損破。所以我要每天換，那不過是我想要爽快點吧了！」</p>
<p>「那麼你不是爲了給與演員以心理上的反應而穿的麼？」那位記者又這樣地問了他。</p>
<p>「不，不是的！」地米爾微笑着答道：「我相信我所導演的演員，是由我所有的一點點的頭腦統御的，决不是由於這一雙長統靴呀！」</p>

<p>聯華的一顆燦爛新星貂斑華，自從「新女性」中一露色相後，便給國人留下了很好印象，愛好影藝者，對於這一個新興的演員，莫不抱着極大希望。</p>
<p>確實，她是個天才者。雖然是新上鏡頭，但表演力决不弱。她有勇氣，肯努力，極認眞，所以「秋扇明燈」，「寒江落雁」中已經有了驚人的收獲。</p>
<p>提起貂斑華願挨打的這件事却特別有趣，當她第一次來拍「江落雁」時，她曾對導演馬徐維邦說：「馬徐先生：我本不會做戲，你不要客氣，我做不好你就打我呀」！這固然是她自己謙虛說的笑話，然而我們足可看出她對於做戲是如何感覺興趣和努力呢。</p>

<p>— 志</p>
<p>宴會是極沈悶的，他們的談話，她不願意聽。但是當他們談到村裏近來發生的事情，她就注意起來。近來有些製造家買了大批的紡識機。所以就把市面的布價跌低了。巴白娜知道那些靠紡織爲生的窮苦人家，一定受到嚴重的損失的。他們正在想用軍隊去壓服他們。那位隊長正在設法去捕捉他們的領袖。那時公爵說通：「是的，但是他們不是容易對付的。我知道他們都已有准備的了。隊長到滿了一杯酒笑着說：「吓！準備。」那時他眞覺得得意了，因爲巴白娜對於這件事不絕地問他，但是倘若他知道了巴白那的本意，他就一定不會這樣高興的了。</p>
<p>巴白娜有一個好朋友，他是這塊地方裏面獨一無二的巡捕。她常常都和他在一起，可是今晚她是特別的想和他談談。她問：「倘若今晚軍隊來了，你還在這裏嗎？」一軍隊嗎？本來我的心是向着那些紡織人的，但是我的職責所在，是沒有法子了。現在倘若是吹得三聲號角的話，他們都會來的了。」「三聲號角嗎？」她問。「這是他們藏在阿特紗廠的暗號。甚麽人都不知道的。」</p>
<p>巴白娜立刻就走，她走得像眞的吉普西女子一樣快，因爲軍隊是定了午夜動手了。她正在走的時候，聽得後面有脚步聲，她正想躱避。可是已經來不及了。她用着吉普西的口音說：「先生：沙拿地方走那裏去呢？我迷失路了。」他正是小牧師。看見她這樣失神的模樣，穿着吉普西服，頭上一捲一捲的美麗頭髮，一雙出神的眼睛。他說：「我或者可以幫忙你的。」一啊，先生，請你吿訴我阿特紗廠在那裏好嗎？我要去見我的父親呢。」覺民相信了她說：「我也要經過那裏的，我帶你去好了。」</p>
<p>他們在不言不語中進行着。她覺得他有些特別的地方。他和他的母親到這裏當牧師。到了不久，就和村人的感情好起來了。本來村裏的人和外來的人在短期間內，是很難合得來的。</p>
<p>在路上巴白娜開始說話了。「我想你一定是人家說的那位小牧師了。」我是這裏的新牧師。他們說「小」牧師嗎？」「不，這是我一時說錯的，但那不是有意得罪你的。像你的身材我正喜歡呢。」她不停的說着。她知道他心理一定在想以他牧師的身份，是否應該和一個吉普西女子同走。最後她問道：「他們說你是反對那些紡織工人和軍隊爭鬥的。」覺民用着講聖經的口吻答道：「我是反對爭鬥的。這就是紗廠了。」</p>
<p>巴白娜一跑進去就看見那大號角了。但是她吹不動。她又跑出來向着小牧師說：「先生，他們都跑了，這個號角是叫人用的。他們一定留在這裏給我的。請你代我吹吹好嗎？」民覺就把這個重笨的號角長長的吹了一聲。巴白娜又說道「這個號角是很難吹的，我想你一定不能再吹響一些的了。」覺民又把這號角饗饗的吹了一聲」。巴白娜快活得拍着手說道：「請你再吹一吹吧。」於是他又吹了一聲。這樣三聲吹完，村裏的忠喊聲，鼓聲，軍隊和村人打起交乎仗起來了。</p>
<p>那時的覺民，眞不明白是怎麽的一回事。那時她要跑了。她臨走的一吻，給這位小牧師弄得莫明其妙。她對他笑着說道：「覺民先生，我相信你一向都歡喜我的。一個男人歡喜一個女人可以禁止得住的嗎？」他道互相道了晚安就走開了。巴百娜回到村裏，已經不把這位牧師放在心上。她知道他是不同道。他是要服從法律的，而她却要領着村人和軍隊反抗。（未完）</p>

<p>— 君山</p>
<p>在數百家汽車製造廠。數百種式樣之中。選擇一輛適宜經濟的汽車。不是一個容易解决的問題。</p>
<p>購買新車之合適與否。須視個人之需要而定。一般無成見的買主。往往任憑憑推銷員的三寸舌尖來决定取捨。是以汽車廠家。除製品日求改進外。推銷之努力。都臻登峯造極。欲免甘言矇蔽。及冀得眞正經濟合適之新車者。觀本篇所述。當得助力焉。</p>
<p>汽缸與燃料　引擎爲汽車主要部份。普通數目是二四·六·八·十·二·十六隻。平常以汽缸數目之多者。車身之設備亦較完美。售價亦愈昂貴。至各個引擎所生動力。以口徑之大小爲標準。非絕對以汽缸之多少爲强弱。在舒適方面。引擎數目較多者。乘坐比較舒服。以同數馬力之引擎。其汽汕之消耗。汽缸多者較少者爲費。汽油果屬零星小費。然通盤計算。往往二三年之間。所消耗之價値。可抵一輛新車之資。富人爲求進一步之舒適。果未惶計及。然普通車主。未必不斤斤於此。如在內地。交通不便。運輸困難之處。尤應以節省汽油爲前提。</p>
<p>馬力之選擇　選擇馬力。須視車主之用途及道路之情形而定。過多過少。均可使車主受不經濟之損失。　　車主購車。本擬乘坐一二人。作爲辦公代步之用。裝載較輕。應擇馬力較少者。如售貨人之汽車。恒多帶貨物。人數較多。自以擇馬力較大者爲宜。至道路之佳劣。與馬力之需要亦有密切關係。平坦與崎嶇山路。汽車行進時所需馬力。恒達數倍或十數倍之差。</p>
<p>速度之斷定　汽車製造廠。對於速度。多規定「標準速度」每小時有三十，四十，五十，英里不等。（有速率每小時超過七十英里者。均屬特製）。詳言之。卽引擎曲軸每分鐘之旋轉。有一千，一千五，二千之別。車輛行駛於此速度。最爲合法。過於此數。引擎易致損壤。不及此數。燃料之消耗。卽不經濟。我國路政尙不發達。當以最低之標準速度。較爲合用。</p>
<p>電系設備　汽車電系。原理雖同。裝置各別。燈光之强弱。喇叭聲之大小。及重要之發火設備。均應斟酌情形。妥爲選擇。大多美國製造者爲電池發火式。歐洲製造者有電池與磁電機發火式。亦有電池發火式。所購之車。如在商埠使用。則上項發火式。俱可應用。如在偏僻城市。無充電池之廠所。一旦電池無電。引擎卽不能發動。屆時勢必擱置。麻煩殊甚。以故內地使用之汽車。應以備有磁電機發火式者爲宜。</p>
<p>保管及修理　注意引擎效力與病症產生之難易。爲購車時第一要務。此問題雖精於此道者亦未易有確切之保證。因汽車之病症。全視保管及修理之良否而定。僅有極少部份屬於製造廠之檢騐粗忽·如以汽車本身而論。價値高貴者。設備較精細。服務比較久長。値價低賤者。設備較簡單。服務比較暫短。至保管修理之繁簡。各車亦大相懸殊。爲普通車主計。未買之前。應略諳內部組織之搆成。庶可較有把握。否則除比較貨物及價格外。似應擇其裝置簡單。易於保管及修理者爲宜。因保管簡易。可减少病端。修理簡易。則可節省金錢時間。二者俱合於經濟條件也。</p>
<p>車身之式樣　車身之式樣。猶我人之服裝。須就個性之愛好及需要而選擇之。車身之種類極多。普通有蓬車。轎車。蓬跑車。轎跑車。華貴大轎車等等。蓬車與轎車。設有五座或七座。適用於大家庭及多數人乘坐之用。車身旣大。載金亦遞增。故汽油之消耗特甚。引擎之負權亦重。其服務之壽命亦比較短縮。蓬車車身。製造簡單。售價低廉。特別適用於熱帶及經濟車主。轎車車身。製造複式。售價昻貴。特別適用於寒帶及經濟寬裕之人。跑車亦稱辦公車。有蓬式轎式二種。因車身輕小。汽油節省。引擎之壽命亦較久遠。但只可乘一二人。適合於往來辦公之用。車後備有蓄物箱。以便携帶輕便物件。如用以出租。則以採購華貴大轎車及特種出租式之轎蓬車爲宜。</p>
<p>零件之配備　擬購某車之前。應先自問。附近有無該車經理處及服務部之設。其服務情形如何。是否常備零件。零件售價如何。緣一車三五年來修理及配零件之價値。往往相等於原車售價。汽車應用日久。損壞在所難免。損壞之後。如無專門熟手。爲之修理。或不能配得零件。勢必向銅匠店。照樣配做。此項配做零件。價値恒較普通昻貴數倍。且效用亦較欠缺。福特及雪佛蘭車銷路最廣之原因。卽因零件售價低廉及易於配得之故。</p>
<p>市而之情形　某車在市面上之名譽與交易之情形。未購之前。亦應先行調查。據社會判斷。有幾種汽車。新用之一二年內出售價値。較其購入原價相差無幾。而他種汽車。馳用一二年後。售出價値低落甚鉅。或竟無人問津。此種市面需要之情形。經濟車主須注意及之。</p>

<p>— 楊德惠</p>
<p>豫省年來地方平靖。對建設事業之進行。頗爲積極。尤以公路興修。突飛猛進。茲將該省及甘省公路建築訊。以告讀者。</p>
<p>（一）洛潼路。自洛陽起。經過宜陽洛寗盧氏閿鄉等縣而至潼關。長三百三十公里。其洛陽至洛寗段。業已開工興建。洛寗至盧氏縣一段。測量已經完畢。盧氏至閿鄉一段。亦已測量完竣。國鄉至潼關段。已由工程隊興築路基中。（二）洛臨路。由洛陽至臨汝。長八十五公里八。業已測量完竣。進行興築。（三）周潢路。周口至潢川。計長一百七十七公里二。其路面工程。於六月間早已完竣。沿途橋樑涵洞。正在積極進行。不久卽可完竣通車。（四）南襄路。由南陽起。經過新野鄧縣而至鄂境襄樊。其在省境內之路面工程。業已完竣。經過白河之巨大橋樑工程。現仍進行查勘中。（五）信荆路。自信陽至紫荆關。長三百五十二公里九。中途經過桐柏唐向新野鄭縣浙川等縣。測量已完竣。籌核經費。卽將動工。（六）沙經路。自沙窩至經扶縣。長二十五公里五二。早已開工。不久亦可完成通車。（七）許南路。許昌至南陽。全路路基土方。早經築修完成。其沿途橋樑涵洞等。由建設廳督促甫經各縣開工中。（ｗｔｙ　盧荆路。自盧氏縣起。經朱陽關而至紫荆關）長約七十公里。曾已查勘。現擬計劃興築。　方黃路。自小方家集。至黃頭嶺。長十八公里九。全路土方工程。業已修竣。只待橋樑之完成。卽可通車矣。</p>
<p>甘省交通梗塞。因之工商業落後。現省政府爲積極建設起見。厥維公路。故其擬定全省公路計劃。有（一）甘陵路。自臯蘭起。經榆中定西靜寗隆德平凉涇川而至窰店。長五萬七十二公里。爲通陝西之要道。又稱甘陝幹綫。可與陝境長武路相銜接。本路原名蘭窄路。歷年雖經修築。但因經費支絀。關於測量事務。始終未曾進行。現估計工程費用。須九八六，四一四·〇〇〇元。（二）甘新綫。自臯蘭起。經永登古浪武威永昌山丹張掖臨澤高臺酒泉玉門安西而至猩猩峽長。一千四百八十一公里。其沿途形勢。頗不一致。由阜蘭城西渡過金城關。沿岸西行十里許。入亂山中。故工程頗爲偉大。估計經費二·五五三·九八四。〇〇〇元。該路可通新疆之哈密。亦卽國道閩新綫之一段。（三）甘靑綫。自臯蘭起。至享堂直達西寗。長一百八十五公里。若由甘而入藏。俱循本路。在政治及國防上。均極重要。其沿途有數處懸崖臨河。工程較巨。估計工程費。須三一九·〇三二·五〇〇元。（四）甘寗線。自臯蘭東北起。經靖遠至興仁堡入寗夏。長二百三十七公里。如延長可達包頭。與東北各省銜接交通。頗爲重要。估計經費。四〇八·七〇六·五〇〇元。（五）甘川第一綫。由臯蘭起。沿甘陝綫之孟家堡。經通渭秦安天水兩當徽縣成縣武都碧口而至川省之成都。長八百五十四公里。其華家嶺至天水一段．已具路形。尙可修理。其天水以南。槪係騎行道。估計工費。一·四七二·七二三·〇〇〇元。（六）甘川第二綫。自臯蘭起。經洮沙臨潭岷縣西固武都而至碧口。長六百二十二公里。估計工程經費。一·〇七二·六三九·〇〇〇元。其甘川第一第二兩綫。連貫隴南富庶之區。且南控巴蜀。西憑關中。地勢非常重要。上述之六大幹綫。除蘭州至西安。至西寗。至寗夏。勉可依照舊道通車外。惟均須根本建築。以上六綫。共長三千九百五十一公里。所需工程總費。六百八十一萬三千四百九十九元五角。尙係沿途橋樑臨時式之估計。若採甩半永久式。開岩之處。改爲雙車道。則其估計之工程費。則須增加。依採用半永久式之磚石墩木面橋。每公尺平均四百二十元。每公里以五尺計。約需二千一百元。特殊橋樑跨度在五公尺以上者。亦擬採用半永久式。每公尺平均四百五十元。每公里以三分之一公尺計。約需一百五十元。石方費平均每公里以五十方計算。每公方約需一元五角。共約需七十五元。如此計莫以及管工等費用。六大綫共計爲一千三百〇二萬六千四百四十七元。比前所估之經費。增加一倍有奇。現省府正在逐步研究分段與造之步驟。以便興建云。</p>

<p>福特公司去歲的損失　據最近福特公司秘書卡茂隆氏在美國廣播電臺報吿上年份營業狀况。其中最堪注意的。就是上年份營業損失達美金六八，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元。這個消息發出後。美國仕女驚駭殊甚。良以福特公司爲美國最大之汽車廠。其製造之步驟及管理的方法，靡不採用最新式而科學化的系統。今結果如是。頗出人意料。據亨利福特本人發表意見云。去年損失最大原因。在車身式樣的迅速轉變。一部分車子。發生銷路呆滯的現象。又因去年份工人的工資增高。其他一切開支仍舊。未能彼此挹注。惟福特意頗堅决。謂此種損失。不過一種極小的試騐。對於大局無絲毫影響。預料本年所得。定能償此損失也。</p>
<p>希特勒指揮下的德國車展最近德國舉行數年來未有的盛大汽車展覽會。元戎希特勒親臨會塲行開幕禮。尤使會塲熱烈若狂。德報鼓吹該會爲世界最大的車展。綜計此次展覽會中。除掉福特分行小部分的美國汽車外。其餘汽車。皆係純粹德製。參加的車廠凡十六。有五十多種的新式汽車。展覽會中最令人滿意者。卽汽車引擎製造的玲瓏精巧。效率極高。並且汽缸的金屬是一種新發明的鋁合金。可以免去銹蝕等現象。同時增加强度。促成很高的壓縮比例。其次流綫的進展。亦有很顯著的成績。車身的材料。差不多已完全採用全鋼片。質輕耐久。很是特別。據臨時報吿營業狀况。Vnion去年銷路最佳。Dgimler比較差一點。然各廠均有很豐美的盈餘。</p>

<p>###剿匪Progress in Northwestern Sichuan Province; Bandits Appear to be Fleeing North Towards Gansu Border</p>
<p>(Nanjing) Chongqing dispatch: Liu Xiang fell ill the previous week due to overwork, losing a lot of blood and being quite weak. Fortunately, the diagnosis and treatment were appropriate, and he is gradually recovering. His sleep and appetite have been good in recent days. With a few more days of recuperation, he should be fully recovered. The fighting in northwestern Sichuan has made significant progress in the past ten days. The bandits have suffered heavy losses.

<h3 id="e7">Guizhou Pacification Commissioner's Office Holds Expanded Memorial Week; Chairman Chiang's Four-Point Instruction; Boost Morale and Work Together to Suppress Bandits, Respect the Party and National Flags, and Act Quickly and Practically <a href="#e7" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c7" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">7</a></h3>
<p>Guiyang: The Pacification Commissioner's Office held an expanded memorial week. Those present included Xue Yue, Li Zhonggong, Guo Siyan, Liu Shan, key personnel from provincial committees, party committees, and various popular organizations, five faculty and staff members from each middle school, and ten students, as well as senior officials from various agencies, totaling several hundred people. Chairman Chiang presided over the meeting, leading the ceremony and reporting in four points: (1) To achieve victory in bandit suppression, we cannot rely solely on the military; we must work from the party affairs and political aspects to eliminate the Guizhou bandits. Not only is the government responsible, but all the people of Guizhou are responsible. How to publicize, train, and organize the entire population to rise up together, and how to find ways to assist the government in eliminating the bandits so that people can live and work in peace, is what the people of Guizhou, especially the party and government personnel and leaders of all circles in Guizhou, should pay special attention to. (2) The deep-seated lethargy and the general tendency for people to wake up late are major blemishes on Guizhou society. Party cadres and leaders of all circles must lead by example, promote getting up early, boost morale, and eliminate lethargy. For example, getting up two hours early every morning, when calculated over a year, is considerable. To boost morale, the first thing is to quit smoking. Smokers are inferior people and this phenomenon must be eradicated in order to build a new Guizhou. (3) All work must be done quickly and practically. If you can do it, do it; if you can't, don't pretend. Understand your responsibilities and do them diligently. This is practicality. Do not delay the time and complete the work within the time limit. This is quickness. Chinese people's work cannot be done quickly and practically, so foreigners can bully us. In the future, we must be deeply aware of this and strive for quickness and practicality. For example, for judicial cases, cases that can be completed every day must be completed. Extremely difficult cases should not exceed one month at most, in order to reduce the suffering of the people. Quickness and practicality are the reasons for the success of politics and military affairs. This is also true for students. If you can complete your daily coursework every day, you will not have to cram at the last minute before exams. (4) The Party and National flags must be respected. The National Flag represents our country, and the Party Flag represents our party. If we do not pay attention to and respect them, and they are not made according to regulations, it is a great shame. National and Party flags must be made in designated stores and in accordance with the law. Others are not allowed to make them in order to avoid errors. (Central News Agency dispatch, 15th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) Kong Xiangxi arrived in Nanjing from Shanghai on the 16th. When asked about the US continuing to raise the price of silver and whether the government was planning to respond and whether it was prepared to protest, he replied that protesting was of course necessary, but the fundamental response was that he believed that if the US continues to raise its silver price, then in order to maintain financial stability, we should raise the equalization tax to cope with it. In addition, internally, we should crack down on speculation and prohibit the outflow of silver. When asked about the implementation time of the income tax and the date of establishment of the Central Bank's trust bureau for providing relief loans to industry and commerce, Kong replied that the opening of the micro-income tax has been largely agreed upon, but there are still a few points that need to be studied in detail. It will not be submitted for discussion at this week's Central Political Council meeting, but the micro-collection method should be finalized in the shortest possible time and submitted to the Central Government for approval. As for the relief loans to industry and commerce, after consultation with industry, commerce, and finance circles in Shanghai, it has been finalized. The ministry has ordered the Central, China, and Communications Banks to comply today in order to effectively relieve industry and commerce. It is expected that the banks will be able to implement it immediately. The Central Bank's trust bureau is gradually getting ready. There are still some parts that are not ready. Once the arrangements are complete, it will be established. (Special dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) After the United States continued to raise its domestic silver price, our country is preparing to respond. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi has stated that the equalization tax is sufficient to cope with the US's increase in the silver price. However, in order to avoid foreign exchange speculation, the equalization tax will not be raised immediately for the time being. After attending the Executive Yuan meeting on the 16th, Kong talked to President Wang about the situation of handling relief to industry and commerce in Shanghai and exchanging opinions on silver issues with the financial community.

<h3 id="e27">Reflections on Financial Austerity in Guizhou Province <a href="#e27" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c27" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">27</a></h3>
<p>— Ren</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that Guizhou Province's income has decreased due to the implementation of the opium prohibition. The provincial government has decided to, starting from May 1st, abolish redundant agencies and suspend or reduce various subsidies. It is estimated that more than 23,000 yuan can be saved each month. This matter is a very fortunate piece of news in today's China, where financial management is needed.</p>
<p>For more than twenty years since the founding of the Republic of China, the finances, whether central or local, have generally been in deficit, with accumulated debts. Generally speaking, almost every province is in deficit, and debts are incurred every year. These deficits and debts are mostly caused by the expansion of government expenses. Since the establishment of the National Government, the administration of officials has been improved compared to the former Northern Government era. However, the phenomenon of establishing positions based on individuals seems not to have been completely eliminated. This is especially evident in the frontier provinces. In recent years, those who have discussed streamlining finances have mostly paid attention to this. Therefore, the saying of "increasing revenue and reducing expenditure" has gradually become the only way to manage finances.</p>
<p>Increasing revenue and reducing expenditure are two different things. To increase revenue, there must be a source to open up and open up, which must not harm the people. To reduce expenditure, there must be an outflow to reduce and reduce, which must not hinder governance. Judging from the current situation in our country, the national economy is declining, there are not many sources to open up, and government expenses are increasing daily. It seems that there are not a few outflows that can be reduced. In terms of the difficulty of financial reorganization, it may be easier to reduce expenditure than to increase revenue. Although, according to the principle, the national finances should be "expenditure based on income," the so-called "expenditure" must be the necessary "expenditure" related to the future of the country, and not include all unnecessary expenditures. As for today's Chinese financial expenditures, such as the expenses of redundant agencies, all are unnecessary expenditures.</p>
<p>The national finances are taken from the people and used for the people. Therefore, to ensure that there is no shortage of finances, we must take into account the people's ability to bear the burden while distributing funds. Then, the national administration will not be hindered as a result, and the national economy will not be damaged as a result. In other words, if one unnecessary expenditure can be saved today, it will preserve one more point of vitality for the people, and it will also increase one more source of revenue for future finances.</p>
<p>Today, Guizhou Province only saves more than 23,000 yuan per month. In terms of financial figures, the amount is extremely small. However, what is insufficient on a monthly basis is more than enough on an annual basis. Saving 23,000 yuan per month translates to saving 276,000 yuan per year. If this policy can be expanded and implemented in the eight provinces under the opium prohibition order, each province will save 270,000 yuan per year, then it will reach 2.2 million yuan in the blink of an eye. If all provinces in the country can hear the news and be motivated to implement it, then it would not be difficult to achieve an annual savings of 8 to 9 million yuan in local finances. If we go a step further and the central finances can also be appropriately tightened, then it may not be difficult to save tens of millions of yuan a year. Accumulating little by little can make a fur coat, and gathering sand can form an island. At this time of national and public hardship, if the national finances can all implement austerity like Guizhou Province, then not only can it create a new era for Chinese finances, but it can also be a way to improve the current national economic environment.</p>

<p>(Tokyo) American businessmen are making every effort to prevent Japanese goods from flowing into Central and South American countries. The Japanese government issued an informal opinion on the 13th, requesting the American government and private businessmen to reflect. The American authorities refuted this and denied that this was the case. However, Chile, Guatemala, and other countries are trying to prevent Japanese goods from entering the country and increase tariffs. Also, Cuba, Peru, Colombia, and other countries intend to abolish the current trade treaty and request a new equal treaty. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs is considering countermeasures and, in order to control both export and import trade, intends to establish a trade promotion policy. On the 15th, a joint meeting was held with the Ministry of Commerce and Industry to discuss various specific measures. (Nippon Union Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) The British government has decided to convene a naval preparatory meeting of Britain, Germany, and Russia in London, and has issued invitations to the German and Russian governments, and announced this matter on the 15th. Having obtained the understanding of France and Italy, when the United States, France, Italy, and Britain were originally scheduled to hold a naval disarmament conference this year based on the Washington Treaty, and the results of the Anglo-American preparatory talks in London were chaotic, this move by Britain aroused general attention. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued the following informal view on this issue at noon on the 16th: This ministry has not received a public announcement from the British naval authorities' talks. However, the German view on rebuilding the navy and the content of the meeting between Hitler and Simon can make it clear that Britain will of course take appropriate measures on this. The true purpose of the Stresa Conference has not been achieved, and it is questionable whether it is appropriate for Britain to start negotiations on naval issues with Germany and Russia. The Japanese government's fundamental policy is not to interfere in European issues, etc. (Nippon Union Dispatch, 16th)</p>

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt sent a letter to Congress on March 4, advocating the subsidy of American shipping, for three reasons: (1) The subsidies or other preferential measures obtained by the shipping industry of other countries in peacetime may put American merchants at a disadvantage; (2) If the United States is a neutral country in wartime and does not have sufficient merchant ships, it will not be able to engage in trade between neutral countries; (3) If the United States is a belligerent country in wartime, there will be a greater need for American ships, not only to be used as auxiliary naval vessels, but also to maintain considerable commerce. As for how much the subsidy will be, President Roosevelt did not specify, but wants to let Congress decide. Today, the Senate and House of Representatives, in accordance with President Roosevelt's wishes, have proposed a bill to directly subsidize American shipping in order to maintain a large number of merchant ships.

<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, French Foreign Minister Laval, in the tense atmosphere of the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting, proposed a resolution in the name of the British, Italian, and French governments to denounce the German government for violating the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles and reimplementing the forced military service policy, and stated that the League of Nations must reprimand the German government for this move and should find ways to make the League of Nations Covenant more effective in the collective security organization. The League of Nations Administrative Council must bear the responsibility of maintaining peace entrusted to it, and the Administrative Council cannot remain silent and stand idly by. The resolution firmly stated that Germany has no right to pass the forced military service law that conflicts with the Treaty of Versailles. (Reuters Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council was originally scheduled to meet this morning, but it has been changed to this afternoon to consider France's application against Germany's re-implementation of conscription. It is heard that the French representative, in view of the difficulty in appointing a rapporteur for the review, will directly submit a motion to the Administrative Council without going through the usual procedure of drafting a motion by the rapporteur. It is heard that this motion contains a paragraph condemning German policy. Poland, Denmark, and some South American countries will vote against this motion. However, the Administrative Council will be able to censure Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles by a majority. (Reuters Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) This afternoon, French Foreign Minister Laval will submit a motion to the League of Nations Administrative Council, the content of which is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The Administrative Council expresses its opposition to the German government's policy of unilaterally abolishing the military clauses of the Treaty of Versailles decided on March 16.</p>
<p>(2) Invite the member states of the League of Nations to establish various new agreements to improve the European security system.</p>
<p>(3) The Administrative Council shall appoint a subcommittee to study the economic and financial sanctions that should be taken against countries that violate treaties, even if the countries that violate treaties are not engaged in war, these sanctions may also be imposed. In other words, the provisions of Article 16 of the League of Nations Covenant will be extended. After Laval submits the above motion, he will probably urge the Administrative Council to make a decision immediately, and even advocate that it should be submitted for expression without going through the rapporteur's review. According to the procedure previously set by the Administrative Council, the proposal must first be submitted to the rapporteur for review, and then a report is submitted to the Administrative Council, and then it is submitted for a vote. It is now heard that some delegations are unwilling to participate in the section on morally opposing Germany's attitude, so France believes that it is more appropriate to change the planned procedure and submit the entire issue of respecting treaties to the Administrative Council for a vote. According to Havas Agency's exploration, Britain and Italy will do their best to support France's request. The diplomatic circles heard that France's decision was quite sensational for a while. When this motion is submitted for a vote in the Administrative Council, it can be expected to pass unanimously, except for some countries that abstain from voting. (Havas Dispatch, 16th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to information from the French representative here, the League of Nations Administrative Council will appoint a three-person committee at today's meeting to study the issue of protesting Germany's restoration of conscription in the French memorandum.

<p>(Paris) The extraordinary meeting of the League of Nations Administrative Council was held for the first time yesterday, and it could only do preparatory work. The newspapers did not think it was unusual, and they believed that the three countries, Britain, France, and Italy, completely agreed on the resolution that the Administrative Council should pass, but there were some differences in form. Morning Post said: Although Poland's attitude is hesitant, the Administrative Council's "meeting situation yesterday was still satisfactory. Britain, France, and Italy have established a close compromise, and the Czech Republic will also join." Business Report said: "The general opinion in Geneva is that if the French delegation insists on its position, the wording of the communiqué issued by the Stresa Conference will definitely be maintained to the end. The results of the Stresa Conference are even more valuable than the verbal accusations of Germany by the League of Nations Administrative Council." The Paris Echo said that although the League of Nations Administrative Council will eventually condemn Germany, it will have to spend some effort. Several newspapers believe that since Germany's reorganization of its military has been submitted to the League of Nations for trial, it will definitely be judged fairly without being vague. For example, Exiles News said: "If the League of Nations Administrative Council adopts a resolution with moderate wording to end Germany's breach of contract, this is completely contrary to the original purpose of the Administrative Council's convening. In short, no one expects sanctions. Since the Administrative Council does not take sanctions, it can only verbally accuse Germany in spirit." The Little Parisian said: "The principles of justice and morality, as well as thousands of years of civilized customs, cannot be treated as child's play." The Little Daily said: "Judging from the current negotiations, the Administrative Council will not be able to end its work until Friday evening, but it is hoped that it will achieve practical results. "The Administrative Council will end the discussion in a way that does not involve ambiguity. Its wording is very clear and must be firm. This is beyond doubt." (Havas Agency Telegram, 16th)</p>

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council met today to discuss the issue of France's request to condemn Germany for violating the Treaty of Versailles. It is learned that if Germany violates the treaty in the demilitarized zone on its border, Britain and Italy are prepared to provide France with military assistance. The two countries reiterated the promise of the Locarno Treaty at the Stresa Conference, guaranteeing peace in the Rhine area, and decided to take military action under certain conditions. The League of Nations Administrative Council's secret discussion lasted only one hour. After the adjournment, it was learned that the Scandinavian countries advocated a moderate approach to Germany and slightly reduced the intensity of the resolution proposed by France. Norwegian Foreign Minister Mengqi met with British Foreign Secretary Simon for a long time. After that, Mengqi urged the Administrative Council to pass a vague resolution and not condemn Germany for violating the treaty. At the same time, it was also learned that the British representative was very concerned that the cooperation between Britain and Italy in the Stresa Declaration might be misunderstood by Berlin as a threat to the German government. Therefore, the British representative made a cautious statement tonight in order to dispel the misunderstanding, saying that this declaration "is not a promise of assistance to France, but a mutual agreement." The French side is doing its best to take strict action against Germany. The French representative has contacted Denmark, Poland, and other countries that want to maintain good relations with Germany and advocate a moderate approach, intending to make them not object and pass the resolution of the Stresa Three-Power Conference. As for Soviet Russian Foreign Minister Litvinov, he still felt that the resolution was too moderate. However, after Litvinov learned that French Foreign Minister Laval had consulted with the representatives of the Little Entente and obtained their support, he also withdrew his opposition. According to reliable sources, the Little Entente has allowed Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria to each have an army of 75,000 men. Czech Foreign Minister Benes told Laval that the Little Entente does not object to the three countries increasing their self-defense forces, but it must be guaranteed that the three countries can participate in the security pact. The attitude of the Little Entente can be summarized in the words of a certain spokesperson, who said, "We are quite satisfied with the results of the Stresa Conference. Now we only pay attention to future issues. The most important thing is the covenant to maintain Austria's independence." The Administrative Council will meet again tomorrow. Sources expect that the League of Nations will pass a declaration, the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The League of Nations cannot regard Germany's abolition of the Treaty of Versailles as legal.</p>
<p>(2) Germany's actions are "regrettable," because this move is an attack on all treaties.</p>
<p>(3) Since Germany has violated the treaty, it is necessary to study in detail how to deal with future violations. The British side here admits that the joint declaration of Stresa does contain the meaning of Britain's guarantee to maintain Germany's demilitarized zone on the border, but it claims that this declaration is not specifically aimed at Germany. The British spokesman also said that the declaration not only protects France from Germany's aggression, but also protects Germany from France's aggression. (National Telegram, 16th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the British Parliament, the representatives of Britain who attended the Stresa Conference did not accept any new restrictions on the European continent. This is very satisfactory. The Parliament also believes that Germany's acceptance of negotiations on a general non-aggression pact does not prevent other countries from concluding bilateral mutual assistance pacts. This move is a real progress in the international situation. However, one cannot expect too much practical effect from Germany's new attitude. As for the reorganization of the military in Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria, it is said that it is not impossible to grant Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria the right to military equality, but it is hoped that this equality will not exceed a certain reasonable limit.

<p>(Geneva) French Foreign Minister Laval today published a lengthy article elaborating on the significance of Article 6 of the Stresa Resolution, which deals with the issue of rearmament of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria. This dispelled the concerns of the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente regarding this article. According to the French Foreign Minister, when the United Kingdom, France, and Italy notified other relevant governments of Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria's desire to amend the military clauses of the peace treaties, they did not express any opinion on the substance of the desire, intending to leave it to the governments more directly involved to decide. This is because the UK, France, and Italy must bear full responsibility for deciding the matter together with other countries. The joint proposal made by the UK, France, and Italy after the Stresa discussions was merely to avoid any resolution of this issue. It is reported that the Little Entente and the Balkan Entente are fully satisfied with the French Foreign Minister's explanation, and therefore these countries have virtually become arbiters of this issue. However, according to news from Belgrade, the Yugoslav government still harbors doubts, wondering why the UK, France, and Italy, which do not allow Germany to amend the military clauses, are now proposing to allow the same request from Austria, Hungary, and Bulgaria.

<p>(Geneva) The French authorities here reported to the Geneva police that three anarchists had been arrested in Marseille, allegedly for plotting to assassinate four major European politicians. However, a Paris dispatch denies that the three were arrested for an assassination plot. According to the reasons given by Paris, the French police, in order to prevent accidents during the Stresa Conference, had arrested several suspicious individuals, but these were only temporary detentions. The report received by the Geneva police stated that these people were plotting to assassinate Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, French Foreign Minister Laval, Czech Foreign Minister Beneš, and Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu. The assassination of the Italian Prime Minister was originally planned for Stresa, while the attacks on the other three were planned to coincide with the meeting of the Council of the League of Nations here. News from Marseille last night stated that the arrests did not take place in Marseille, but that the arrested persons were the Italian anarchist Ganzir and his accomplice Calonne, and that Calonne was a woman. The Swiss authorities said that this news was exaggerated, but border security has been particularly tightened, and guards have been increased around the League of Nations offices.

However, bankers were comforted by the fact that the pound sterling was heavily attacked last year, but the equalization fund was still profitable. The stock exchange took the budget calmly because it was as expected. It is widely believed that the restoration of government employees' salaries and the increase in allowances will enhance the current government's support among voters. The important changes to the tax rates in the budget are: income tax on the first £135 is reduced from 27 pence per pound to 18 pence per pound; the threshold for married individuals is raised from £150 to £170; and in view of the decrease in the birth rate, the allowance for children after the first child is increased from £40 to £50. The tax exemption for single individuals is limited to £125. The reduction in official salaries in 1931 will be fully restored from July 1, costing an additional £4 million. Unmilled rice will be taxed at two-thirds of a penny per pound, and soybeans will be taxed at 10% ad valorem. The free preferential tariff for soybeans will be implemented from August 1. Entertainment tax for seats costing 6 pence or less will be abolished. When presenting the bill, Chamberlain said that, generally speaking, we can say that we have restored 80% of prosperity. Our job today is to restore the remaining 20% without damaging the credit that has already been built. If there is peace abroad and unity at home, there is no reason to say that we should not make great progress towards prosperity this year. The budget estimate is made with this belief. Chamberlain also mentioned the achievements of last year, saying that industrial production increased by about 12%, manufacturing production has set a new record, exports have increased by £30 million, interest rates remain low, and the number of major projects has increased greatly, especially in construction. The cost of living for the whole year is still much lower than in 1931, retail sales continue to develop, and national savings are no less than before. The net increase in the Post Office Savings Bank, Trustee Savings Bank, and sales of savings certificates is about £50 million. This continuous progress has now been realized. This is no longer a question. The results are so good that there is nothing like it in the world. It is estimated that expenditure next year will be £730 million. Revenue, estimated on the basis of current taxes, can reach £736.6 million, leaving a surplus of £5.6 million. (Reuters dispatch, 15th)</p>
<p>(London) Those who benefit from the restoration of salaries and the reduction of entertainment tax and income tax have praised this budget, while the increase in heavy oil and soybean taxes and the reduction in road maintenance funds have been criticized by those involved in road transport, animal husbandry, and the automobile industry. Chancellor Chamberlain delivered a radio address from London last night, calling this a budget for the poor, but public opinion seems to refer to this as a budget for the lower middle class. The *Daily Express* said that this budget aims to win the favor of the two million income taxpayers, while the 17 million working families will gain nothing except for slightly cheaper movie tickets. This view is not entirely agreed upon. According to *The Times*, the government is still confident that a general election will not be held before 1936. Generally speaking, the newspapers welcome this budget, but the reduction of road maintenance funds and the lack of provisions for debt repayment reserves have been criticized by some newspapers.

<h3 id="e51">Germany Promotes "Recreational Fitness" Movement; Weekend Outings Beneficial for Physical and Mental Health and Crucial for Increasing National Strength <a href="#e51" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c51" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">51</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) Recently, a "Recreational Fitness" movement has been reorganized in Germany and is being promoted nationwide, aiming to encourage all working people to participate in this exercise. The association recently issued a declaration stating that, out of Germany's 30 million adults, only 7 million actually participate in various games and sports. The remaining 23 million are working people who lack exercise. However, these hardworking people, especially the elderly, although they know that their physical strength is declining and they can no longer compete with young people, must feel the urgent need for appropriate relaxation exercises. If they can temporarily leave the city every weekend to relax their body and mind in the city parks, it will be of great benefit to their physical health. Walking and swimming are especially important for restoring health. If everyone can follow this, not only will individuals benefit infinitely, but it will also be crucial for increasing national strength. Therefore, the association has decided to expand its promotion, hoping to awaken all working people across the country, so that they can understand the benefits of exercise and make weekend outings a common and good habit.

<h3 id="e96">Li Guojie's Appeal Case - High Court Verdict <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>Suzhou News: After Li Guojie of China Merchants Bureau appealed to the Jiangsu High Court, the High Court repeatedly sent personnel to Shanghai to conduct trials in the Shanghai Local Court. The court proceedings and the altered conviction were reported in previous newspapers. Now the full text of the verdict in this case has been finalized by the High Court and printed yesterday (16th) afternoon. A true copy is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Jiangsu High Court Criminal Verdict, 21st Year (23rd Year Conclusion), Suit No. 1060. Appellant: Li Guojie, male, 55 years old, native of Hefei County, Anhui Province, residing on Henry Road, Shanghai, former General Manager of China Merchants Bureau. Defense Attorneys: Lawyer Lu Hongyi, Lawyer Lu Shifang, Lawyer Jiang Yiping. The above-mentioned appellant, in the case of breach of duty, being dissatisfied with the first-instance judgment of the Shanghai Local Court on December 27, 21st year of the Republic of China, filed an appeal. After the judgment of this court, he appealed to the Supreme Court, which remanded the case to this court for retrial as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text: The original judgment regarding the crime and sentence of breach of duty is revoked. Li Guojie, with the intention of illegal possession for himself, embezzled public property in his possession and is sentenced to imprisonment for one year and two months. The number of days of detention before the final judgment is determined to be offset against the term of imprisonment at a rate of two days for one day.</p>
<p>Facts: Li Guojie was originally the Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Shanghai China Merchants Bureau. On February 26, 21st year of the Republic of China, he was also appointed by the Ministry of Communications as the General Manager of the Bureau. At the same time, Chen Fumu, the Vice Minister of Communications, was appointed to serve concurrently as the Supervisor of the Bureau. After Li Guojie took office, he believed that the poor performance of the China Merchants Bureau over the years was due to the dilapidated ships, incomplete docks, and cargo handling facilities. Unless a large sum of money was borrowed to pay off old debts, redeem mortgaged properties, add ships, and build docks and warehouses, there would be no other way to reorganize. He then submitted a report to Supervisor Chen Fumu for approval to mortgage the land and buildings along the Bund and Sichuan Road on Fuzhou Road, Shanghai, and the Zhongbei Hua and other warehouses and docks, to the Shanghai China General Corporation for Shanghai taels of silver each, with an agreement to receive 85% in actual value, a commission of 2%, and an annual interest rate of 9%, for a period of 20 years, and two contracts were signed, referred to as the "Construction Loan" and the "Dock Loan". Another memorandum for the purchase of ships on credit was signed, referred to as the "Ship Purchase Loan," which was to order 30 new-style ships from the American Da Lai Shipping Company for the China Merchants Bureau to use. The ship prices were negotiated according to the market value at the time and were all treated as loans, with a corresponding interest rate. On September 5th and 6th, Li Guojie and China General Corporation signed the aforementioned contracts separately and submitted them to Supervisor Chen Fumu for stamping. Unexpectedly, Chen Fumu took the opportunity to demand bribes from Li Guojie, intentionally withholding the contracts. Li Guojie, because China General Corporation repeatedly urged him, fearing that the plan would fail, on the 23rd of the same month, negotiated with China General Corporation to advance 700,000 taels of silver from the 20 million tael loan and disposed of it without authorization, handing it over to Huang Jusu, a representative sent by Chen Fumu, for Chen Fumu to receive, intending to gradually make up for it in the future when business developed. Therefore, he did not record it in the China Merchants Bureau's accounts. At the same time, after Chen Fumu received the money, he returned the contracts. Not long after, Chen Fumu left his post. Li Guojie, because he could not make up for the 700,000 taels he had advanced, intending to escape his own involvement, wrote a letter to the Minister of Communications reporting Chen Fumu's extortion. The Ministry of Communications then ordered the Shanghai Municipal Government to arrest Li Guojie in November of the same year and send him to the Shanghai Local Court Prosecutor for investigation and prosecution.</p>
<p>Reasons: After the appellant in this case took office as the General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, he submitted a report to Supervisor Chen Fumu for approval and signed construction loan and dock loan contracts with the American China General Corporation, mortgaging the land and buildings along the Bund and Sichuan Road on Fuzhou Road, Shanghai, and the Zhongbei Hua and other warehouses and docks, for a total of Shanghai taels of silver each. In addition, a ship purchase loan contract was signed. On September 5th and 6th, 21st year of the Republic of China, it was signed with China General Corporation separately. Then, on the 23rd of the same month, 700,000 taels were advanced from the 20 million tael loan and handed over to Huang Jusu, Chen Fumu's representative, for Chen Fumu to receive. Not only has the appellant repeatedly stated this in court, but also the China General Corporation delivered ten promissory notes from the McCalie Bank and one promissory note from the HSBC Bank, each worth 50,000 taels of silver, to the appellant on September 23, 21st year of the Republic of China, plus one promissory note from HSBC Bank and one promissory note from Citibank, each worth 71,736 yuan and 01 cents, calculated at 0.0697 taels per yuan, each equivalent to 50,000 taels of silver, totaling 700,000 taels, which have also been investigated and verified by the Prosecutor of the original court and this court. After Chen Fumu received them, he and Huang Jusu used pseudonyms such as Chen Shaode, Chen Zesheng, Wei Junhong, Wei Zhenhong, Huang Weiruo, Huang Zhongde, Huang Zhengde, Huang Yude, Feng Duanyi, Feng Shuyan, etc., and deposited them in the Zhongfu, Jin Cheng, China banks and the Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau on the 24th, 26th, 27th, and 29th of the same month. There are bank statements available for verification. The addresses of the depositors, such as No. 28 Meili Garden, Da Xi Road, is Chen Fumu's residence, and No. 5 Zhaofeng Road is Huang's residence, which have also been proven by the door-keeper and the watchman Yao Dekui Hu Shuyou etc. Therefore, the appellant's claim that the 700,000 taels in advance were handed over to Chen Fumu is true. As for the reason for the delivery, the appellant argued that according to Articles 5, 2, 3, and 10 of the China Merchants Bureau Supervision Office Regulations, the formulation of contracts, the reorganization of capital, and other important matters all fell within the authority of the Supervision Office. The 700,000 taels in advance were part of the agreed loan and were specifically used for the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau. Their receipt, storage, and management were naturally within the reorganization plan, and the matter was extremely important and naturally fell within the scope of the Supervision Office's authority. Chen Fumu had the right to receive and keep the money, and the appellant followed the order to withdraw and submit it. How can there be any embezzlement or bribery, etc. However, Article 1 of the China Merchants Bureau Supervision Office Regulations clearly stipulates that the China Merchants Bureau Supervision Office is solely responsible for supervision, and all reorganization plans of the Supervision Office should be the responsibility of the General Manager's Office for execution, as stipulated in Article 3 of the same Regulations and Article 2 of the China Merchants Bureau General Manager's Office Regulations. The Supervision Office is solely responsible for supervision, while the General Manager's Office is responsible for executing affairs. The authority is very clear. Moreover, the functions of the Supervision Office have been listed one by one in Article 5 of the Supervision Office Regulations, and there is no clear stipulation for receiving, paying, and keeping money. However, Articles 10, 1, and 2 of the General Manager's Office Regulations clearly state the functions of the Accounting Department of the General Manager's Office, including "receipt and payment of cash" and "safekeeping of bank books and checks." Although the 700,000 taels in advance were generated from the signing of the contract, signing the contract is one matter, and receiving, paying, and keeping the money is another. Since they are separately stipulated in the regulations of the Supervision Office and the General Manager's Office, the result of signing the contract cannot be that all matters arising from the result of signing the contract are handled by the Supervision Office itself. The so-called other important matters refer to those not stipulated in the regulations. Receiving, paying, and keeping money have been clearly stipulated in Article 10 of the General Manager's Office Regulations and are not included in this general scope. The appellant also argued that Article 11 of the Supervision Office Regulations also stipulates that the Supervision Office may hire consultants to handle legal, accounting, and construction matters, but this refers to supervising accounting administration and not performing accounting duties. In short, the supervisory authority has no jurisdiction over all matters of the subordinate agency. To replace the subordinate agency to handle all affairs is not possible. Moreover, the China Merchants Bureau and China General Corporation agreed on the construction loan, dock loan, and ship purchase loan contracts, all of which must be stamped by the Supervisor, while the receipt of 700,000 taels in advance from China General Corporation was only issued by the General Manager. It can be seen that the appellant had long recognized the authority in signing the contract and receiving the money, and would never mistakenly believe that Chen Fumu had the authority to keep the money and rashly hand over 700,000 taels, which can be asserted. Even from the perspective of the delivery situation at the time, if Chen Fumu had indeed kept the 700,000 taels, why was there no clear order from the Supervision Office to withdraw the money? Why did the appellant not use an official document to present it when handing over the 700,000 taels? There was no formal receipt and no temporary receipt from the responsible person, and the China Merchants Bureau did not record it in any accounts. Even if it is believed that the money was specifically used for the reorganization of the China Merchants Bureau, separate books could have been created and specially recorded. How could the receipt of 700,000 taels be unaccountable? The saying of handing over for safekeeping is clearly an excuse to shirk responsibility afterwards and is difficult to believe. Furthermore, the appellant submitted a letter to the Minister of Communications on November 13, 21st year of the Republic of China, in which it was stated that the money was demanded by Supervisor Chen Fumu and that if it was not paid, the contract could not be established. Guojie dared to swear to heaven that he did not take a penny. Later, during the investigation by the original court, he still stated that after the borrowing contracts were signed, he used official documents to ask the Supervision Office to seal it. He then held the contract and refused to release it. At the same time, he asked people to express that he wanted to raise some funds and asked him what it would be used for. He refused to say. The price-maker did not know this situation and urged the contract. I had no choice but to ask the company to advance a batch of money first. Later, I paid the money on one side, and he delivered the contract on the other side. The 700,000 tael check was issued by the company. He demanded that it not be registered. I was really afraid that the China Merchants Bureau would close down, so I gave Chen Fumu 700,000 taels. I also intended to achieve great things without worrying about small expenses. As for this money, I thought that after the business got better in the future, I would gradually pay it back. It has been said that Chen Fumu requested bribery and the various circumstances of the delivery have been confessed. It is not an empty word. Taken together, when the appellant submitted the contracts for signing to the supervisor, Chen Fumu deliberately withheld the contract and took the opportunity to solicit bribes. The appellant then negotiated with China General Corporation to advance 700,000 taels of silver and hand it over to Chen Fumu, but did not record it in the China Merchants Bureau's accounts, preparing to gradually make up for it in the future when business developed. The appellant knew that the money belonged to the China Merchants Bureau and was specifically used for reorganization, but he exceeded his authority and disposed of it without authorization, transferring it to bribery funds, which shows that when he received the money, he had already regarded it as his own, so he dared to use it freely. Examining his actions, in addition to constituting the crime of delivering bribes, he should also be found guilty of embezzling public property in his possession. However, the reason for his embezzlement was due to bribery, which clearly has a method and result relationship. According to Article 74 of the Criminal Code, he should be sentenced to the more serious crime of embezzling public property. The original judgment recognized the crime of breach of trust under Article 366, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Code, which has been revoked by this court, and acquittal has been pronounced. Regarding the embezzlement part, since it was the result of delivering bribes, the original judgment did not discuss the bribery part. Chen Fumu was the supervisor of the China Merchants Bureau and signing contracts was his duty. When the appellant asked for the seal to be stamped, Chen Fumu took the opportunity to ask for bribes and was given them. Only the act of paying bribes to public officials regarding their duties should constitute a crime under Article 128, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Code. The original judgment erroneously believed that bribes were paid to public officials regarding acts in violation of their duties and should be charged with the crime under Article 129, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code, and also cited Paragraph 4 of the same article, ruling that 700,000 taels should be confiscated, and if they had disappeared, they should be recovered, without paying attention to the provisions of the second part of Article 62, Paragraph 1 of the same law, which were all incorrect. As for the appellant's report to the Minister of Communications, it was nothing more than an attempt to escape his own involvement, which did not meet the requirements of self-surrender stipulated in Article 38 of the Criminal Code. The original judgment's reference to that article to reduce the penalty by one-half was also not legal. Although the appeal in this case is groundless, the original judgment is also inappropriate and should still be revoked and revised by this court. In conclusion, in accordance with Article 385, Paragraph 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law, Articles 357, Paragraph 1, 128, Paragraph 2, 74, and 64 of the Criminal Code, the judgment is as stated in the main text. Prosecutor Zhan Yuafen of this court executed the duties of the prosecutor at the court. The appellate court in this case is the Supreme Court. If the parties are dissatisfied with this judgment, they should file an appeal with this court within ten days from the day following the service of the judgment, with a written statement of the reasons for disagreement.

<p>Jiangsu High Court Criminal Verdict, 21st Year (23rd Year Conclusion), Suit No. (Supplementary 2) 1060. Plaintiff: China Merchants Bureau, Legal Representative Liu Hongsheng, male, 48 years old, native of Dinghai County, Zhejiang Province, residing at No. 2 Fuzhou Road, Shanghai, General Manager of China Merchants Bureau, Litigation Attorney Lawyer Wang Youling. Defendant: Li Guojie, male, 55 years old, native of Hefei County, Anhui Province, residing on Henry Road, Shanghai, former General Manager of China Merchants Bureau, Litigation Attorney Lawyer Lu Hongyi, Lawyer Lv Shifang, Lawyer Jiang Yiping. In the case of the above-mentioned plaintiff and defendant's appeal case, which is being tried in this court, a civil lawsuit is filed incidentally. This court's judgment is as follows:</p>
<p>Main Text: Li Guojie shall compensate the China Merchants Bureau 700,000 Shanghai taels of silver and pay interest at a rate of 8% per annum from April 28, 22nd year of the Republic of China until the date of settlement.</p>
<p>Facts: The plaintiff's attorney stated that the request was the judgment in the main text. His statement in essence stated that when the defendant was the General Manager of China Merchants Bureau, he signed a loan contract with China General Corporation. The corporation advanced 700,000 Shanghai taels of silver, which the defendant issued a receipt for and then disposed of himself while in possession, using it to pay bribes. The defendant should be held responsible for compensation. The Supreme Court remanded the case for further review on the public prosecution aspect, and the accompanying civil lawsuit was remanded along with it. If the public prosecution results in no changes, the attached civil lawsuit remains subject to the judgment prior to the further review. The defendant stated that the request should be to dismiss the plaintiff's lawsuit, arguing that I handed over the 700,000 taels to the supervisor, Chen Fumu. Chen Fumu should be held responsible and I cannot compensate on behalf of Chen Fumu.</p>
<p>Reasons: The facts determined by the criminal judgment, limited to the proof and liability related to the crime, have a binding effect on the accompanying civil lawsuit. This is clearly stated in Article 512 of the Criminal Procedure Law. In the present case, regarding the part of the public prosecution, this court has determined that after the defendant took office as the General Manager of the China Merchants Bureau, Chen Fumu, the supervisor, approved the signing of a 20 million tael loan contract with China General Corporation. When presenting the contract for approval, Chen Fumu took the opportunity to solicit bribes. The defendant then negotiated with the corporation to advance 700,000 Shanghai taels of silver and hand it over to Chen Fumu. It was determined that he was guilty of the crime of delivering bribes and embezzling public property for his duties. Based on Articles 357, Paragraph 1, 128, Paragraph 2, and 74 of the Criminal Code, a criminal sentence was ruled. Therefore, the defendant should bear the responsibility for compensating for the damage to the rights of others as a result of the crime. The plaintiff's attorney's request remains according to the original claim, the judgment on the defendant shall be to compensate 700,000 Shanghai taels of silver, and the interest is 8% per annum from April 28, 22nd year of the Republic of China, until the date of settlement, there is no objection, The defendant's excuse that the 700,000 taels were taken away by Chen Fumu and that Chen Fumu should be held responsible is not well-founded and should be rejected. Therefore, the defendant should be ordered to pay back to the plaintiff 700,000 silver dollars, calculated at 0.0715 taels per dollar, equivalent to 977,020.0979 yuan in silver dollars, and interest at a rate of 8% per annum from April 28, 22nd year of the Republic of China, until the date of settlement. Based on the above discussion, in accordance with Articles 509 and 507 of the Criminal Procedure Law and Article 184, Paragraph 1 of the Civil Code, the judgment is as stated in the main text.

<h3 id="e97">Chinese Ratepayers Association of the International Settlement Held its Representative Assembly Yesterday and Elected Yu Qiaqing, Xu Xinliu and Five Others as Chinese Directors, Wang Yansong and Others as Committee Members, and Wang Boyuan as Land Committee Member; Resolved to Oppose Telephone Price Increases and Officially Issue a Declaration <a href="#e97" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c97" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">97</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Ratepayers Association of the Public Concession held its first representative assembly yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM at the Bankers' Club on Hong Kong Road, where they elected directors and committee members to the Municipal Council, as well as the executive committee for this year. Yu Qiaqing, Wang Yansong, Wang Xiaolai, and others were elected. They also decided to issue a declaration the same day to oppose telephone price increases. Details of each are recorded below:</p>
<p>Representatives Present Yesterday's attendees included Zhao Tiezhang from the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Geng Jiaji from the Municipal Government, and 75 individuals including Wang Xiaolai, Wang Yansong, Wu Zhihao, Cao Zhigong, Gu Wensheng, Wang Honghui, Xu Jutang, Xu Wenzhao, Jin Runxiang, Hu Fengxiang, Yan Guangdi, Shen Tianxin, Chen Binghui, Xu Xiaochu, Chu Huiseng, Ma Shaoquan, Lu Wenshao, Mao Heyuan, Song Shixiang, Cheng Xiechun, and Xu Jiyu.</p>
<p>Assembly Staff Chairman: Wang Xiaolai; Vice Chairman: Xu Jiyu; Secretaries: Yan Kuasheng, Tao Ledong; Administrators: Gao Wosheng, Xu Fansun; Tellers for the Election of Chinese Directors: Cheng Xiechun, Qian Longzhang; Ballot Counters: Shen Tianxin, Yu Zhongxian; Tellers for the Chinese Committee: Chu Huiseng, Wang Yansong; Ballot Counters: Cao Zhigong, Ke Ganchen; Tellers for the Land Committee: Song Shixiang, Xie Zhongfu; Ballot Counters: Mao Heyuan, Zhang Henghai; Executives in Charge of Committee Reports: Wang Hanliang, Hu Fengxiang, Ye Jiaxing, Ma Shaoquan; Ballot Counters: Sun Mingqi, Wang Honghui, Chen Binghui, Zhang Yichen.</p>
<p>Chairman's Address The chairman of the representative assembly said in his speech: "Representatives from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, representatives from the Municipal Government, and fellow representatives, at a time when Shanghai is facing considerable difficulties, the responsibility of this Association is even greater than before. This is because the interests represented by this Association are not merely limited to the taxpayers of the Public Concession, but the interests and influence it can involve extend to the entire city, the entire country, and even the world. Therefore, the words and actions of this Association must not exceed the provisions of Article 2 of this Association's charter, which is to 'develop the autonomy of the concession and seek public interests and equal treatment.' The meaning and steps of this provision are that we must first develop autonomy before we can seek public interests and equal treatment. However, how to seek the development of autonomy, what methods and means to use, this requires political scholars to design. But reading the Tianjin Ta Kung Pao of March 16th, an article published by a German economic expert who is a consultant to the Economic Committee, it said, 'Some say that the Chinese people have not yet developed a degree of self-government. I believe that this argument is untenable, because the degree of local self-government is being gradually implemented in practice, so that there can be practical training before maturity can be spoken of. A great Prussian politician a hundred years ago, based on this view, coupled with a determination to carry it out, endowed the people who had not yet developed at all with a system of self-government, and achieved astonishing results. Therefore, I should also trust that the intelligent and virtuous Chinese people have the ability to self-govern.' In the chairman's speech at the first meeting of the previous representative assembly, in order to make the status of the Shanghai Special Zone particularly clear to Chinese and foreign people, it was said that once Chinese directors join the special zone's municipal administration, it becomes jointly managed by Chinese and foreigners. Therefore, in fact, the autonomous organ of the special zone has become a 'self-governing organ jointly run by Chinese and foreign residents.' If we can evolve from this, and give it a short period of time, it is definitely the most peaceful and straightforward way to unify and complete the administration of Shanghai." Therefore, anyone who recognizes this fact and understands the opinions of the above-mentioned German expert will enthusiastically support and encourage the vigorous progress of this Association based on its charter, which is something to be extremely fortunate about. However, the history of this Association, starting from October 14th of the Republic of China year 14, will soon be fifteen years. The Municipal Council of the Public Concession has had our local directors and committee members for seven terms. Whether we have the ability to operate and govern ourselves is not something that this Association can know on its own. However, since it is a self-government jointly run by Chinese and foreigners, the selection of people who represent us at the Municipal Council is naturally a matter of concern to foreigners. As far as can be recorded, (1) A year ago, during a debate in the British House of Lords on the China issue, Lord Eddington mentioned the Shanghai issue, saying that the Municipal Council now has five Chinese directors and countless Chinese committee members, whose work is very valuable. (2) The Feetham Report, and (3) the speech of the Chairman of the Annual Meeting of Taxpayers of the Municipal Council, all deeply praised the representatives of the taxpayers present at the Municipal Council, and considered the selection of people to be appropriate. Confucius said, 'At fifteen, I set my heart on learning.' This Association will soon be in its mid-teens, so in the development of self-government, we should be like Confucius setting his heart on learning, and strive to practice it even more. Although people have different talents, and there are differences between those who are aware early and those who are aware later, when they succeed, they are the same. If one person can do it a hundred times, and ten people can do it a thousand times, then even if one is afraid, one will surely become clear, and even if one is weak, one will surely become strong. This is in line with Sun Yat-sen's instruction to 'catch up head-on' and achieve the goal of equal treatment. Each representative of this Association bears the heavy responsibility entrusted by the taxpayers, and the earnest expectations of the government and society, and should unite and strive to live up to the world. The major work of this Association in the past year, and the efforts of the previous representatives to the Municipal Council, have been recorded in pamphlets and need not be repeated. However, among the resolutions of the first meeting of the previous representative assembly, some have already been implemented, and some have not been seen to move. For example, the music team is still not cancelled, and we really do not know why the opinions of the taxpayers are so discriminated against, which is truly bewildering. As for the education problem, it is one of the focuses of the exchange of notes on March 26th of the Republic of China year 17. Although it is progressing gradually, it is still far from the goal. Regarding the education of our Chinese people, it has been decided to simultaneously increase and subsidize it. However, although the subsidies have increased slightly year by year, the eight-year plan to increase schools has been neglected and has become an invisible situation of stagnation. It must be known that education is an important task of modern political systems, and especially the responsibility of autonomous organs. The Municipal Council has established itself in the position of a 'quasi-autonomous organ,' and must not favor one over the other. If one looks at the education budget, the comparison of school-age children, the level of teachers' salaries, and the cost per student, one can know that the statement of 'favoring one over the other' is not unfounded. According to the eight-year plan, from the Republic of China years 20 to 27, a total of 17 complete primary schools should be established, and a total of six complete middle schools should be established. The number of students entering primary school should be about 10,000, accounting for about 7% of school-age children. Under the current situation, it can barely be considered comforting. Unexpectedly, the Bureau re-examined this minimum eight-year plan, claiming financial difficulties and suspending it for one year. This Association lamented this greatly at the previous general assembly. However, considering that the local economy in recent years has indeed been inferior to before, and construction has been frequent, allowing it a little rest may also be permitted by the times. We deeply hope that after the one-year period, it will proceed according to the original plan. However, the Board of Directors did not adopt the Education Committee's proposal to add two primary schools and one girls' high school, and the education budget for this year did not include the funds for increasing schools. Then, the minimum plan has become empty talk on paper, and we really do not know what the intention is. If it is said that there is no funding, then the music team has been authorized by this Association to dissolve, but it has refused to implement it, and this year's budget still lists 244,000 yuan. It is so stingy for undertakings that seek the welfare of the majority, and so generous for settings that cater to the enjoyment of a very small number. Should the policy of a public organ be like this? As for the textbooks for middle schools, there is no need to use English entirely. For example, for mathematics, if English is used, there is no need to have it taught by English speakers, so the cost can be saved and hiring will be more convenient. This is in fundamental conflict with the content of the exchange of notes, and it is also contrary to the principles of education. This Association should take this opportunity to solemnly declare and warn the authorities in charge of the actual autonomous organs that 'the eight-year plan is the minimum education policy for our local landowners. Unless it is carried out quickly and thoroughly, there is absolutely no way to dispel the difficulties in the understanding of taxpayers, and the selection of educators should also take into account the suitability of language, habits, customs, and people.' This is a touchstone for whether the municipal authorities will cooperate sincerely from today onwards. The Special Zone Court was difficult to establish based on the agreement, but its position is completely independent. If there is any behavior that is 'inconsistent with the law,' there are legal procedures for correction, and it is a serious stain on the dignity of the court to openly attack and despise it in public places or public publications, which is a serious stain on those who pride themselves on the rule of law. As far as this Association knows, 'the Special Zone Court considers the police officers of the Municipal Council to be civil servants,' but the Municipal Council's annual report for the Republic of China year 23, on page 20, under the Special Zone Court section, states that 'the court authorities refused to recognize the police officers of the Municipal Council as civil servants,' which is inconsistent with the facts. The taxpayers must correct this erroneous understanding in the publications of impartial organs, in order to rectify public perception and avoid social misunderstandings. We hope that the Municipal Council's rulers will be extra vigilant in the future, strictly abide by the spirit of decisiveness, and maintain the dignity of the court. For the service of the previous representatives to the Municipal Council, we would like to express our deep gratitude on behalf of the taxpayers, and hope for your guidance.</p>
<p>Report of Directors and Committee Members The report of the directors and committee members of the Municipal Council of the Public Concession for the Republic of China year 23 stated: "We were mistakenly appointed by the previous representative assembly as directors of the Board of Directors and members of various committees of the Municipal Council for the Republic of China year 23. A year has passed, and our term is coming to an end. Today, we are pleased to attend the first meeting of the representative assembly for the Republic of China year 24. We would like to report on the matters related to our Chinese citizens that we have participated in and carried out during our term of office. (1) Distribution of duties in the Administrative Committee. The number of members of the Municipal Council's Administrative Committee this year is no different from the previous year. It is in the administrative system of the Bureau, connecting the top and bottom, and holding the key. It has been described in detail in the previous report, so there is no need to repeat it. Westerners, seeing the indifference of taxpayers towards participating in electoral politics, believe that in order to encourage the political enthusiasm of voters, it is essential to give them opportunities to participate in politics, so that everyone sees the goodness and evils of local administration as their own business, and then they will have a sense of shared weal and woe. Under the current administrative system of the concession, expanding the organization of the Administrative Committee and recruiting well-known people from all walks of life to participate in deliberations is the beginning of opening up the municipal administration. According to past practice, the most important task when new directors gather in a special meeting is to decide the number of seats and the candidates for each committee. In addition to the directors themselves allocating work and distributing the committee members elected by this Association, there have also been cases of inviting outside people to participate in the organization, but the number is not large. This is because there are concerns that the committee will become too large and its operation will not be flexible, so there are slight restrictions. Currently, there are about 30 Chinese committee members hired by the Bureau. The Chinese School Subsidy Committee is purely organized by Chinese people, and the Chinese committee members are the chairmen of the Water Price Review Committee. After the addition of Chinese committee members to the Land Committee, it has been two years now. As the municipal administration becomes more developed, the power of Chinese people to participate in politics will naturally gradually expand. Looking at the past from the present, its gradual progress can be reviewed. The Chinese candidates for the main committees are listed below: Finance Committee: 7 seats, 2 Chinese seats, held by Xu Xinliu and Wang Yansong; Police Committee: 8 seats, 3 Chinese seats, held by Yu Qiaqing, Jiang Yiping, and Xi Yushu; Works Committee: 7 seats, 3 Chinese seats, held by Yuan Ludeng, Guo Shun, and Wang Yansong; Staff Committee: 6 seats, 2 Chinese seats, held by Bei Songsun and Guo Shun; Public Utilities Committee: 7 seats, 3 Chinese seats, held by Feng Bingnan, Jiang Yiping, and Yu Hualong; Health Committee: 9 seats, 3 Chinese seats, held by Jiang Yiping, Chen Jicheng, and Yu Hualong; Transportation Committee: 9 seats, 2 Chinese seats, held by Xu Xinliu and Xi Yushu; Education Committee: 9 seats, 4 Chinese seats, held by Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Liu Zhanen, and Ou Yuanhuai; Library Committee: 5 seats, 2 Chinese seats, held by Bei Songsun and Chen Jicheng. (2) Promotion of Chinese education. The Municipal Council's education policy, after being re-established by the Education Committee in the Republic of China year 20, is divided into two major outlines: 1. To promote Bureau-established schools; 2. To subsidize private schools. In recent years, education administration has been carried out in accordance with this. As for Westerners, let's put it aside for the time being. In terms of Chinese education, the eight-year construction plan and the designated private school subsidies are all based on this outline. The eight-year plan started to be implemented in the 20th year, and it was decided to add two primary schools every year. By the end of the 23rd year, two girls' middle schools were to be established. There are now five primary schools. Except for one on Huade Road, all have self-owned school buildings, and the scale is roughly complete. However, because the Bureau's finances have not been prosperous in recent years, it is still Zhu Keshi's plan to proceed, which is frustrating. Moreover, the original proposal was to review the entire plan by the Republic of China year 23. As a result of the review, construction was suspended for one year, which is even more regrettable. Now that the suspension period has expired, the two primary schools and one girls' middle school that should have been added this year have not been included in the budget due to the Bureau's financial difficulties, which is inevitably disappointing. Since the eight-year plan was solemnly announced by the Bureau in the past, and the plan is actually a minimum facility, we still hope that the Bureau can find other ways to promote its realization this year. In addition, the new school building of the existing girls' middle school was completed at the beginning of the year and has been moved into. The Jingzhou Road Primary School was also used to open a night school in the autumn of last year, which specializes in receiving unemployed workers and teaching them simple courses. Many people came enthusiastically. The subsidy system has been expanded year by year since its implementation. In the Republic of China year 21, the amount was only 110,000 taels of silver, and 57 schools were subsidized. The following year, the amount increased to 140,000 taels, and the number of schools also increased to 87. Last year, at the suggestion of our colleagues, it increased by 50,000 taels, totaling 190,000 taels, and the number of schools also increased to 150. This year, the number of schools has increased by another 45, and the amount has increased to 210,000 taels. As in the past, the Bureau will set up a subsidy committee to be responsible for the distribution. The Health Department will also send people to inspect, and those whose health facilities do not meet the regulations will be suspended. Last autumn, the Japanese Residents Association suggested stopping the establishment of new schools and transferring all the construction fees to subsidies. The Education Committee believed that this move was contrary to the current education policy, because the current policy stipulates that the construction of new schools and the subsidy of private schools should be carried out in two separate ways, so as not to be unbalanced. If the education construction funds are concentrated on the subsidy route, not only will there be practical disadvantages of being uneven, but the years of planning that have been effective will be abandoned in one fell swoop, which is not advisable. The Board of Directors approved its proposal, and the Japanese proposal was therefore denied. (3) Establishment of the Rickshaw Management Office. Since the establishment of the Management Office in May of last year to improve the rickshaw system, three Chinese and foreign paid committee members have been dedicated to this task. Their task is to promote 13 of the 16 items recommended by the Rickshaw Committee. The remaining three items, which relate to the recovery of car licenses and the organization of new companies, will be handled later. In the past year, achievements have been made, such as registering real car owners, organizing rickshaw pullers' mutual aid associations, and reducing car rentals, which have been quite laborious. (4) Improvement of the Public Library. The Municipal Council used to have a public library attached to the Municipal Building on Nanjing Road, commonly known as the Foreign Language College. After the sale of the Municipal Building, the books were moved to No. 22 Nanjing Road and opened as usual. The library has books and newspapers for people to browse, but they are mostly in Western languages, which is inconvenient for Chinese people. Therefore, there have been repeated proposals to add Chinese classics. According to the library's funding, except for a small portion borne by regular users, the rest is allocated from donations and taxes, and the income from donations and taxes is mainly from our Chinese people. Our Chinese citizens account for the vast majority of the population in the concession, so it is reasonable and necessary to collect and include Chinese classics. Currently, the library has 3,800 volumes of Chinese books, which were donated by Mr. Yan E-sheng, the secretary of this Association. The volumes are quite numerous and carefully selected. The person in charge has compiled a catalog for easy reference. Our citizens can go to read them at any time after work. In this year's budget, a part has been allocated for the purchase of new books and newspapers for the purpose of increasing Chinese books and newspapers. The catalog of new books is published in the Chinese Public Gazette on a regular basis, so you can pay attention to reading it. In order to encourage Chinese people's interest in the library, the Bureau has ordered the Information Department to widely disseminate the news of adding Chinese books, and painted large Chinese characters in front of the library as a guide. The library has a suggestion book on a regular basis, so readers can sign their opinions on the books to be purchased and other matters to be reformed at any time for adoption. If the number of Chinese readers gradually increases in the future, and the use of Chinese books becomes more and more widespread, the funds for adding Chinese books and newspapers will naturally increase year by year, without saying a word. The library's opening hours are set from 8:30 am to 8:00 pm every day. On Sundays, it will be changed to start at 10:00 am and still at the afternoon. (5) Key policies of public health. There are three things to pay attention to in the concession's health administration: (1) Donating funds for the construction of the Beiqiao Town Mental Hospital. In July of last year, Mr. Lu Bohong represented the hospital and asked the Municipal Council to donate construction funds. The Bureau decided to donate 100,000 yuan to designate several beds specifically for accommodating patients in the concession, on the condition that the Municipal Government and the French Concession authorities would donate together. Now the Municipal Government has donated 100,000 yuan, and the French Concession's Public Board of Directors has also donated 50,000 yuan. The Bureau's 100,000 yuan has also been issued. Patients can be accommodated in May. The establishment of the mental hospital is in line with the needs of the times and is of great benefit to public health. It is gratifying that the Bureau and the Municipal Government have worked together to achieve this. (2) Adopting the recommendations of the Milk Committee. The Milk Committee was organized and established a year ago. Last year, it drafted a report, which was revised by the Health Committee and approved by the Board of Directors for adoption. The main motion was the issue of milk and cream disinfection. All proposals to organize a municipal disinfection plant were rejected by the committee. (3) Conducting school health inspections. School health inspections are an essential policy to protect the health of the nation. The Municipal Government has been implementing it for a long time. The Municipal Council's schools also started to implement it last year. It is organized by the Health Department and started with Chinese children's primary schools. The Huaide Road, Jingzhou Road, North District, and East District primary schools have been inspected, with a total of more than 2,600 students. Special attention is paid to trachoma and free treatment is provided. Other diseases are either diagnosed by private doctors or temporarily suspended from school to go home for recuperation. The scale of the inspection office has been slightly expanded this year. Although the scope is small, it is not without results. (6) Consideration of telephone price increases. The telephone business in the concession was previously handled by the China-Foreign German Telephone Company, but the results were unsatisfactory. Since the Shanghai Telephone Company took over in the Republic of China year 19, it applied to the Municipal Council the year before last for permission to increase prices, but the Bureau rejected it. This year, it re-applied for the previous request. The reason it gave was that according to the provisions of the patent contract, the company should get a net profit of 10% annual interest. Taking last year as an example, after deducting income and expenditure, the net profit was only slightly more than 6% of the investment amount, which was far from the amount of guaranteed interest. It should be allowed to increase prices by about 23% from April of this year and implement new charging rules. All commercial telephones will be charged according to the number of calls, and other types will be increased or decreased according to the current price. As soon as the news of the price increase was heard, Chinese and foreign groups raised objections. According to the company's calculation of various items of profit and loss, such as the payment of US government income tax and the management fee of the International Telegraph and Telephone Company, were listed under the expenditure items, which resulted in a sudden increase in expenditure, and the operating income was not enough to pay the guaranteed interest. There is room for discussion on all of these. The income tax item was not within the scope of the contract, so it should not be rejected by the users. That is, the management fee paid to the International Company (calculated at 4.5% of the total income per year, which requires about 300,000 yuan) should not be burdened by Shanghai for a long time. As for the depreciation item, the Bureau had previously lent to help the company at the end of the year before last to change the debt from gold to silver. Therefore, the number of investment aspects should be reduced by 3 million yuan, and the amount of annual depreciation can also be greatly reduced. The cash case is still under careful consideration. During this period of economic decline, everything that can avoid increasing the burden on citizens should be fully committed to. (7) Negotiations on the return of roads built beyond the boundary. The negotiations on the return of roads built beyond the boundary have been intermittent and have not been resolved. Although the draft agreement has been drafted, the opinions of the two sides are difficult to agree on suddenly. There are about two things: (1) The four boundaries of the area where the agreement is implemented; (2) The organization of the special police station and the number of police officers. There are many practical difficulties in determining the four boundaries, which need to be resolved urgently. Although the number of police officers and the nationality of police officers seem to be easier, they still cost a lot of effort. Last October, the two sides resumed negotiations. After several consultations, significant progress has been made in all the points listed in the agreement. What is particularly gratifying is that the public utility companies in the concession have completed negotiations with the Municipal Government on the issuance of patent contracts for the area where roads are built beyond the boundary. However, business development still depends on the resolution of the entire issue of roads built beyond the boundary. (8) The financial situation of the concession. The main sources of income for the Municipal Council's finances are the general municipal tax, the land tax, the wharf tax, and the license tax. In the past, the local economy was prosperous and the tax sources were excellent, so all municipal development plans could be carried out step by step. In addition to balancing revenue and expenditure in the annual budget, there was often a surplus. The general municipal tax is now 14% of the rent value. Several years ago, it was increased by 2%. Later, the electricity department was sold, and 8.1 million taels of silver were obtained. The city treasury suddenly became wealthy, and the additional 2% tax was abolished. This was the matter of the Republic of China year 19. In recent years, the municipal administration has developed day by day, and the balance of revenue and expenditure is often lost. Although there have been proposals to increase taxes from time to time, the local business situation is declining compared to the past, and the rise and fall of the economy are really important. We cannot burden the people's livelihood, so this proposal has been made and withdrawn several times. We still focus on reducing expenditure to cultivate tax sources and temporarily alleviate the people's difficulties. Last year, because various administrative offices made a lot of efforts to tighten their belts, and as a result of the silver being expensive and the gold being cheap, the budget expenditure could be reduced. Therefore, the total revenue and expenditure of the annual final account were balanced, and there was a surplus of 1.1 million taels of silver. However, the tax revenue was also 430,000 taels short, and the 45,000 yuan of the Rickshaw Management Office was not originally in the budget. Therefore, the net surplus was about 700,000 yuan. We had previously predicted that only 40,000 yuan could be left over. Now we have obtained this number, which is very gratifying. As for this year's (i.e., the Republic of China year 24) budget, the regular expenditure is about 27 million yuan, and the tax revenue is about 25.9 million yuan. The shortfall is about 1.2 million yuan. As in the past, it will be allocated from the public accumulation fund to maintain its balance. The increase in taxes can be postponed again. The abundance of public tax revenue is closely related to the prosperity of the local economy. In recent years, the business situation has been depressed and the people's livelihood has been difficult. The municipal administration should also focus on saving money. Last year's surplus exceeded expectations, and this year's revenue and expenditure can be balanced again. It is comforting to be able to report this during this period of economic decline. (9) Improvement of the transportation system. Shanghai is an important hub for sea and land transportation. It is located in an important place with a dense population and heavy traffic. The traffic in the city is very congested, and the development of the area is increasing. Therefore, how to circulate traffic, facilitate pedestrians, and has become an important policy today. The Bureau has made every effort to carry out the work. Within the possible financial resources, it has given priority to acquiring private land and expanding the road surface. This year alone, the purchase of land at the corner of Henan Road and Nanjing Road cost 300,000 yuan, which can be seen in general. There are many other roads that need to be widened. It is not only not allowed by the city treasury to do it all at once, but also because the owners do not have any renovation plans, they cannot be forced to move and buy at a price. Therefore, they can only proceed step by step and determine the priority according to the urgency of the needs. Other improvement measures, such as adding traffic lights, revising parking regulations, and designating one-way traffic routes, are all being carried out step by step. The one-way traffic that is inconvenient for merchants, such as the area around Hankou Road, has been changed. In addition, attention has been paid to the cooperation between public buses and trams at various stations to facilitate passengers, and double-decker public buses have been added to avoid congestion, all of which have been somewhat effective. The Chief of the Police Department is currently on leave, and the Bureau is providing him with convenience to investigate the latest transportation methods in Europe and the United States for adoption. As for transportation issues that have a consistent nature throughout the city, the three-sector authorities will hold joint meetings to seek cooperation and jointly solve them. Shanghai's administration is divided into three districts, so each key policy has its own system. Transportation is one example. If the three parties can cooperate and plan a unified transportation network, then it will be a great benefit to our citizens. The above are the recordable events in the concession's administration in the past year, and they are particularly closely related to Chinese people. I have described the beginning and the end to inform you. The Municipal Council's annual report and gazette have been published in Chinese for many years. The key policies in the boundary are disclosed from time to time. The Chinese annual report was only one-third of the English version when it was first published. This year's translation is more detailed and has many volumes. This Association will send them to taxpayers for reading. Everything that is omitted in this report is detailed in the report. Since we have taken office, we have been afraid of failure. Fortunately, we have been encouraged by you from time to time, so that we can work hard to go. We are still ashamed that we cannot live up to the expectations of the citizens. Please forgive us. Reported by Directors Yu Qiaqing, Yuan Ludeng, Bei Zuyi, Xu Xinliu, Jiang Yiping, Committee Members Lin Kanghou, Guo Shun, Wang Yansong, Xi Yushu, Chen Jicheng, and Yu Hualong, April 16, Republic of China year 24.</p>
<p>Land Committee Report The Land Committee member Gu Wensheng reported: "I have checked that the Municipal Council's Land Committee has a fixed number of five members, two of whom are Chinese committee members and three of whom are Western committee members. In the previous session, the Chinese committee members were elected by the Chinese Ratepayers Association and the Shanghai Real Estate Association, respectively. The Western committee members were elected by the Municipal Council's Board of Directors, the Western Taxpayers Association, and the Western Business Owners Association, respectively. When the election was held in April of the 23rd year, Wensheng was not talented, but deeply grateful for your kindness and was mistakenly appointed as a committee member. I am confident that my knowledge is shallow and my efforts will fail, but I am deeply grateful for the cooperation of Feng Bingnan, the Chinese committee member elected by the Shanghai Real Estate Association, and the Western committee members Bai Yunshi, Bu Luke, and Pi Ke, as well as the secretary Lang Ke, etc. I have worked hard and have not failed in my duties. I am still satisfied with the weight of the entrustment. Wensheng will do his best to express his sincerity and gratitude to you."</p>
<p>Chinese Director Mr. Guo Shun</p>
<p>Chinese Director Mr. Chen Zhezhen</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>I also checked that after Wensheng was elected in April of last year, he did not receive the first meeting notice until January 10 of this year. Up to now, there have only been three public decision cases and four attendance meetings. In the meantime, eight months have passed, and the meeting is like a virtual setting, and there is no way to consult. Although this is not Wensheng's heavy burden, it is not without guilt. This is because matters concerning the collection of land are directly contacted with the owners by the Works Department of the Municipal Council to give prices and accept them. Whether the valuation of both parties is fair or not, Wensheng is not only unaware of the truth, but also other committees are afraid that it is difficult to speculate. As for the following three public decision cases, they were either caused by unfair pricing or because the owners had special interests and requested compensation for the collection of search prices before being submitted to the Land Committee for public decision. In the middle of a year, in addition to the following three cases, we have been able to understand the inside story and consistently advocated public decision with the Chinese committee member Feng Bingnan, and the details are published in the Municipal Council Gazette. It is difficult to report the rest in detail. This is really a regret and shame. I hope that my enlightened people will understand. The outlines of the three public decision cases are listed below. Fortunately, I will review them. 1. Land Public Decision Case No. 235, meeting time: 4:00 pm on January 10 and January 31 of the 24th year, Block 160, Central District, land registration book, located at the corner of Nanjing Road and Henan Road, owner Mrs. Hardoon, total land area of 3 acres, 3 minutes and 0 inches, and 0 centimeters, and 0 meters, land to be acquired with 1 acre, 2 minutes and 0 inches, and 8 centimeters, and 0 meters. 2. Land Public Decision Case No. 236, meeting time: 4:00 pm on January 24 of the 24th year, Block 3038, Western District, land registration book, located on Xinzha Road and Carter Road, owner Changye Real Estate Co., Ltd., total land area of 12 acres, 6 minutes, 6 inches, 3 centimeters, and 0 meters, land to be acquired with 7 minutes, 3 inches, 4 centimeters, and 0 meters. 3. Land Public Decision Case No. 237, meeting time: 3:30 pm on March 21 of the 24th year, Block 501, Central District, land registration book, located on Tianjin Road, owner Kung Ho &amp; Co., total land area of 1 acre, 6 minutes, 1 inch, 3 centimeters, and 0 meters, land to be acquired with 3 minutes, 2 inches, 9 centimeters, and 0 meters. Land Committee Member Gu Wensheng's report, April 16 of the 24th year.</p>
<p>Yuan Bei's Statement (1) Director Yuan Ludeng solemnly stated after the report of the directors and committee members: "I have served as a consultant and director of the Municipal Council for eight years, before and after. It is difficult to take care of both the spirit and the time. It is only because the matter concerns the public trust that I have to try my best. However, this long-term re-election is not allowed for both public and private reasons. Therefore, I especially declare that I will not be re-elected this year under any circumstances in order to reduce the burden. I hope you will forgive me." (2) The chairman read Director Bei Songsun's letter, saying that he was mistakenly recommended last year and勉任 as a director of the Municipal Council. In the past year, he has been short of accomplishments. However, the affairs have become more and more complicated. In any case, it is impossible to be re-elected.</p>
<p>List of Elected Candidates After the report of the directors and committee members, Yuan Ludeng and Bei Songsun reported the reasons why they should not be elected as directors this year. Then, the election began immediately. According to the results of the voting, (1) Yu Qiaqing received 71 votes, Xu Xinliu received 71 votes, Guo Shun received 63 votes, Chen Z</p>
<h3 id="e98">Guangdong Province: Northeastern Guangdong Suffers Severe Flooding; The Southern Section of the Yuehan Railway Is Submerged; Huizhou Is Greatly Inundated, and Boluo County Experiences Levee Failure <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Guangzhou dispatch: Various areas of Guangdong Province have experienced continuous heavy rains for over a month, leading to a sudden surge in river levels across the northeast, west, and other regions. The situation is particularly severe in the northeast, resulting in widespread flooding. Residents in the affected areas are actively evacuating, facing considerable hardship, and causing food prices to rise dramatically, creating a genuine disaster. Upon investigation, the Beijiang River channel is naturally shallow and narrow, causing the river to overflow regularly during the two rainy seasons. This time, heavy rains in Hunan Province flowed towards Guangdong, and the waters of the Xiaobeijiang River also drained into the Beijiang. With the combined rainwater, the Beijiang River has swelled even further, with Shaozhou, Yingde, Qingyuan, and other counties bearing the initial impact. Starting from the 7th of this month, the areas along the southern section of the Yuehan Railway, including Shaoguan, Maba, Yingde, and Xiangjiangkou, have been transformed into a vast swamp. The water level is approximately nine feet higher than normal. The Junqiao bridge outside the south gate of Shaozhou and a wooden bridge near Yingde have been destroyed by the flood, disrupting transportation. The water depth in Shaocheng is several feet, requiring pedestrians to use boats for movement. Yingde's terrain is lower than Shaozhou, so the floodwaters in Yingde City are about seven or eight feet high, having already reached the upper floors of residences. Most residents have temporarily moved to higher ground for safety, resulting in significant losses of furniture and goods. The water flow at Xiangjiangkou is becoming increasingly rapid. From Shaozhou to Xiangjiangkou, passing through the various stations in Yingde, the view is an endless expanse of water. The Yuehan Railway's roadbed is only nine feet above the water surface, and if the floodwaters rise another foot, trains will be unable to operate. Therefore, the Yuehan Railway Bureau has been exceptionally busy with flood prevention work in recent days. On the 10th, a mountain flood occurred near Yingde Station, causing earth to collapse and block the railway tracks, leading to train stoppages. Fortunately, engineering personnel were dispatched immediately to clear the mud, and train service was restored in the afternoon. According to reports from the Railway Bureau's special envoy, this flood on the Beijiang River exceeds the flood of 1919 by twenty-eight feet, breaking all previous records. The government, upon receiving the report, has instructed the Qujiang, Yingde, Qingyuan, and other county governments to implement flood prevention measures and provide relief to the refugees. Various charitable organizations in Guangzhou have also dispatched personnel carrying relief supplies to provide assistance in the disaster areas. On the eastern front, torrential rains also began on the 7th of this month, lasting for three consecutive days and nights, causing the water level to rise sharply. On the 8th, the water level was over nine feet, and by the 9th, it had exceeded ten feet. The lower reaches of Boluo and Huizhou have become greatly inundated, and the water flow is ceaseless. The Shuitangwei area in Boluo County breached on the same day, with a gap of several feet, resulting in the inundation of all villages within the area. All villagers from three townships and one administrative unit fled to the hills for safety, with dozens of houses collapsing due to the flood. On the 10th, the water level rose another four feet. The Shuimen Village, Shaxia Township, and Xiapu Township along the Dongjiang River in Huizhou have been transformed into a vast swamp, with fields and farmland completely submerged. In Huiyang County, the areas of Shaibuchang, Xiami Street, and Mupaixia in the county seat have water depths that reach the shin, and residents are actively moving furniture to the upper floors to prevent losses. Outside Boluo County, the water level in Mupaixia and Hongsheng Temple has reached the knee, requiring residents to travel by boat. The construction of the Tonghu dike has been halted recently, and the surrounding fields and crops along the river have been submerged by the flood, making a poor early harvest predictable. The water level of the Xijiang River showed little change before the 9th. However, after the 10th, as the floodwaters of the Beijiang River flowed in, the waters of the Xijiang River could not flow freely, causing the water level in Sihui, Zhaoqing, and other counties to rise by two to three feet. The water level at the Hekou section in Sanshui County is level with the embankment, and the rapid current makes navigation dangerous. Fortunately, the floodwaters from Guizhou Province have not yet arrived, so the water level has not increased drastically. If the waters of the Beijiang River can be discharged within a few days, the Xijiang River may avoid becoming a major disaster like the northeastern rivers. (April 12th)</p>

<p>The twenty-odd temples in Luodian Town, in response to the severe drought last year that led to rural bankruptcy, have jointly initiated a god-worshipping festival (commonly known as "jiehuangqian") to pray for abundant harvests and the well-being of the people. Preparations have been underway for over a month. Hundreds of so-called large and small gold and silver ingots have been made, with the largest being over ten feet tall and several feet wide. Various flags, umbrellas, and ceremonial paraphernalia have been collected exhaustively. Rare and ancient treasures are also on display in the various temples. In recent days, crowds have been flocking to the town from distant places to offer incense. The festival is scheduled to begin at 1:00 PM on the 18th of this month (Thursday). This type of festival was held once twenty years ago, and the grand occasion caused a stir at that time.</p>

<p>The home of Wang Shunqing, a resident of Zhilü Township in the sixth district of the county, was suddenly visited by more than a dozen bandits on the night before yesterday. Speaking in a Hakka accent, they carried guns and other weapons, broke down the door and entered, overturning boxes and cabinets, searching arbitrarily. After about an hour, they swaggered away. After checking, it was found that jewelry such as beaded flowers, gold bracelets, and gold rings, worth about 500 yuan, had been robbed. The matter has been reported by the victim to the fifth police station of the public security, which has been reported to the County Bureau, requesting that personnel be sent to investigate and arrest the perpetrators.</p>

<p>Datieqiao Street in the north gate of the city is a prosperous area in the northern commercial district. At the southern end of the bridge, there is a Yang Qinghe Silver Shop, managed by Zhang Shanqing from Jian County. The business is good. It was robbed once seven or eight years ago, but the case has not been solved. The shop staff and shareholders are all from the Ningbo gang. The night before last (the 15th) at 8:15 PM, just as the market was closing, three robbers suddenly came, speaking in a Zhejiang-Wuxi accent. Two robbers entered the shop, claiming they wanted to buy a gold bracelet, and one robber was on the lookout outside. Shop assistant Ji Zunhua came out to negotiate and invited one robber to the reception room to talk, and ordered apprentice Shen Zhichun to take out a pair of twisted silk and flat bracelets from the back warehouse, weighing three and a half taels. Unexpectedly, the robber pulled out a pistol from his sleeve and fired a shot at Ji Zunhua, causing Ji's left arm to be shot. Bleeding profusely, he hid in pain. The shop staff were all frightened and stood like wooden chickens. The robber then snatched the gold bracelet into his pocket, rushed out the door, and fled towards the Yingxiangqiao Daochang Alley. Afterwards, Hong Houchang, the director of the first public security bureau in charge, Zhong Jizuo, the captain of the public security bureau's investigation team, Wu Zhengrong, the chief of political police of the county government, and Xu Yi, the attached officer of the sixth security brigade, all received the news one after another and personally led armed police teams to investigate. An empty shell of a pistol bullet was found. The situation was tense at the time, and a temporary curfew was announced, as if facing a great enemy. Half of the five city gates were closed, and pedestrians entering and leaving were searched. Police were sent to check in the thatched sheds, but it was all in vain and nothing was found. The wounded man was sent to the Tongren Hospital by the shop manager for treatment. The injury was slight and there was no danger to his life. Also, Zhou Wu, a woman from Sheng Alley under Xiaoyanjiapeng in the fourth district, was also robbed of a gold ring by bandits with guns near Longshanshao. However, the bandit Sun Aying was arrested on the spot. In the case of Wang Shiyi, a resident of the town, who encountered bandits at Jiuliji, the director of the third bureau, Dang Zhongyue, arrested the bandits Zhu Xiaofengzi and Wang Xiaosi yesterday and sent them to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<p>Chen Daguan's eldest son, Agou, in Shenwan, Huazhuang Township, District 264, is 21 years old and works as a waterman. He is honest and straightforward and has not yet married. However, he has already engaged a Miss Shen from Shenxi Alley as his wife and plans to marry next year. Shen Meisheng, a neighbor on the left, is a businessman in Shanghai. His wife, Ms. Mou, is very romantic and unwilling to sleep alone. She is familiar with Afu, the son of Chen Renquan nearby. On the 4th of this month, Afu planned to go to Shen's house to continue the fun, but Agou found out and followed him, calling out to catch the adulterer and deliberately making fun of him, which angered Afu. So he ran out and grabbed Agou, beating him severely, causing serious injuries. After Agou returned home, he was bedridden and his injuries worsened day by day. He vomited blood and died in the middle of the night on the 12th of this month. Zou Shiling, the head of the district, reported the matter to the local branch court. Yesterday (the 16th) morning, Prosecutor Shen led officials to the countryside to inspect the body and determined that he had died of injuries sustained before his death. After the examination, because the murderer was on the run, he ordered the family of the deceased to collect the body and wait for the arrest of the murderer for investigation.</p>

<p>Gu Tinghua's son Guoxian, a villager in Qidong Guangyi Village, was kidnapped by bandits on the night of the 31st of last month. Also, the homes of Yao Futai and Gu Wochang in Changxing Town were robbed by more than a dozen bandits in the second phase of this month.

On the 6th of this month, Criminal Court President Sun Enrong opened the court to interrogate him once. On the morning of the day before yesterday (12th), Ni Yueqiu was sentenced to sixteen years in prison. It is said that Ni did not accept the judgment and appealed to the High Court yesterday (14th).</p>

<p>The notorious bandit Zhang Zhigao has been causing trouble in the counties of Huai, Lian, Ye, Shu, Fu, Ning, and Yancheng for many years. He has repeatedly resisted the garrison troops, relying on his gang to resist arrest, and has never been captured. The people of each county have long regarded him as a tiger. In recent years, he has looted Yilin in Funing and Guzhai in Lianshui, devastating the area and causing thousands or tens of thousands of dollars in damage to the people. It is even more difficult to count the number of lives lost. He was arrested in Shanghai by the Jiangsu Provincial Security Command and escorted to Pu on the evening of the 13th and temporarily detained in the Seventh District Security Command. This (14th) morning, Chief of Staff Li Fuzhen extracted the bandit, verified his identity, and tied him to the Nancheng School Ground for execution by firing squad.</p>

<p>Jiaxing is located at the intersection of Jiangsu and Zhejiang and the main road between Shanghai and Hangzhou. Smuggling and private transport of opium are easy to mix in. Although the authorities have strictly investigated and banned it, it is difficult to eliminate it completely. Now, Wu Wangji, the special commissioner for smoking ban, believes that the number of opium smokers in Jiaxing County accounts for about 15 per thousand of the total population, and the money spent on drugs every year is more than 500,000 yuan, which is quite alarming. He has listed it and reported it to the province and ordered the county to strictly investigate and ban it to eliminate the opium poison.</p>

<p>Ding Sishi, a farmer from Zhangshi Village, Shiwang Township, Sixth District of Jiaxing, was working in the field at 3:00 PM on the 15th when he suddenly heard a gunshot, so he paid attention to watch. He only saw a boat coming from the east in the river port in the south. A person on the boat was holding a quick gun and shooting at the shore. A child in the boat shouted "Daddy" frantically. After a while, the boat left. Ding then went to check and saw an unknown man, about 50 years old, wearing a blue cloth short jacket and blue cotton pants, with a bullet wound in his abdomen. Ding Sishi reported the incident to the local police station, and patrol chief Chen Ruizhang went to inspect the scene. The corpse was entrusted to the village chief Zhu Shunguan for proper care and reported to Zheng Hui, the director of the Sixth Branch Bureau, who then reported to the court for an examination. According to general speculation, the shooting was a vendetta.</p>

Soong Expresses Optimism About the Financial Future; Chinese and Foreign Banks Are Willing to Cooperate with Us; The Government Guarantees There Will Be No Inflation <a href="#e117" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c117" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">117</a></h3>
<p>National News Agency Shanghai, April 16: T.V. Soong, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, in view of some inaccuracies in the draft of his speech issued by a news agency today, has specially submitted his official speech draft to the National News Agency for publication as follows. Mr. Soong first stated that my country is indeed encountering great difficulties, but we must remain calm, because the world is in an economic recession. Shanghai has suffered the most, but my country is based on agriculture, and the adverse effects on farmers are still manageable. Shanghai's prosperity must ultimately rely on the mainland. The situation in the mainland is greatly improving, and Shanghai will definitely benefit from it, which is really gratifying. Mr. Soong continued that he had informally exchanged views with some Chinese and foreign bankers, and the results were very moving, because they were all able to cooperate to deal with this common problem, regardless of Chinese or foreign. This is also gratifying. In addition, the Minister of Finance adheres to his sound financial and sound fiscal policies, which is very important. At this point, Mr. Soong reaffirmed that he had obtained a government guarantee that there would be no inflation. Looking at the above factors, we are very optimistic about the future. As for the US continuing to raise the price of silver from 64 cents to 71 cents, Mr. Soong said that this will of course increase my country's difficulties, but the method of strictly prohibiting the private smuggling of raw silver exports is now quite effective, so there will be no panic in Shanghai. Central News Agency said that T.V. Soong, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Council and Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, met with reporters from various newspapers at the Bank of China at 10:00 AM yesterday and made the following remarks.</p>
<p>Foreign Banks Express Cooperation</p>
<p>According to Mr. Soong, since taking office as Chairman of the Board of Directors of the Bank of China, he has not had any exchanges with the foreign banking community, so he invited the foreign banking community to lunch on the 14th (reporter's note: Soong's residence denied this on that day). The attendees included the managers of HSBC, Citibank, Chartered, Credit Lyonnais, Mitsubishi, and Yokohama Specie Bank, as well as Messrs. Seidel and Beisson. During the meeting, informal exchanges of views were made on financial issues, and the results were quite good. Everyone present was able to focus on finance and put their own interests aside, and cooperate fully. They also expressed their willingness not to export silver automatically on the silver issue. I have conveyed the results of the exchange of views to Minister of Finance Kong.</p>
<p>No Large-Scale Export of Silver</p>
<p>Regarding the question of whether the silver export equalization tax needs to be increased, this matter is within the authority of the Ministry of Finance. I am in the position of the banking community and obey the Ministry of Finance in everything, so it is not convenient to express my opinion. However, as far as I know, there has been no large-scale export of silver recently. The government is still constantly expressing to the US government that this kind of action is really harmful to China. So far, there has been no other new action. According to reports, Belgian Prime Minister Qi Lande is preparing to launch a conference to promote the restabilization of the world's major currencies. I am not very clear about the content of this conference, but Mr. Qi Lande has taught in the United States for many years, and his thinking may be close to that of President Roosevelt.</p>
<p>I Hope the People of the Country Will Deal With It Calmly</p>
<p>I observe that there is absolutely no reason for panic in my country's financial future. If you believe in ghosts, you will see ghosts. I hope the people of the country will deal with it calmly and not disturb themselves. Regarding the relief of industrial and commercial borrowing, it has been decided to use 5 million as commercial credit loans and 15 million as industrial and commercial mortgage loans. As for how the banks will allocate them, it has not yet been determined. In the future, the Bank of China will do its best to handle it. The National Economic Council currently has no plans for the entire financial sector. I am scheduled to go to Beijing for a line within the day to discuss it.</p>
<p>Merger of the Three Banks Is Absolutely Impossible</p>
<p>A reporter from Xin Sheng News asked that some people advocated that the Central, China, and Communications Banks should be merged to concentrate their strength and establish a large bank to cope with the Chinese economic environment. Mr. Soong said that the businesses of the three banks are different. The Central Bank is the bank of banks, the Bank of China is the international exchange bank, and the Bank of Communications is the industrial bank. Their natures are completely different. For example, the Central Bank absolutely does not engage in ordinary banking business. Judging from this, how can the three banks merge? This is absolutely impossible.</p>
<h3 id="e118">Twenty Million Dollar Loan Release: Awaiting Ministry of Finance Order for Consultation on Implementation. Over 300 Million Dollars of Silver Reserves in Shanghai Stabilize the Public Mind; Foreign Banks Resolved Yesterday Not to Export Silver <a href="#e118" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c118" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">118</a></h3>
<p>A dispatch from Xin Xin News Agency reports that following the decision to release twenty million dollars in loans to aid industry and commerce, the market atmosphere has shown signs of activity. The Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications are awaiting instructions from the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai before jointly consulting with the Bankers' Association to discuss implementation methods. The Bankers' Association has already raised a credit loan fund of 1,885,000 dollars, which will be incorporated into the overall operation. Yesterday, the equalization tax rate remained unchanged, and exchange rates slightly lengthened. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Twenty Million Dollars Subscribed by Various Banks</p>
<p>As a result of discussions between Minister of Finance Kong Xiangxi and the financial community, it was decided to use fifteen million dollars for factory mortgage loans and five million dollars for credit guarantee loans. The source of these twenty million dollars has attracted considerable attention. A reporter from Xin Xin News Agency visited yesterday a bank executive who attended the financial meeting the day before. According to the executive, the twenty million dollar loan release will await instructions from the Ministry of Finance in Shanghai, after which the Central Bank will preside over consultations with the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, and member banks of the Bankers' Association to discuss implementation methods. The source of the funds will primarily be the Central Bank, the Bank of China, and the Bank of Communications, with other banks acting as backup. Whether a banking syndicate will be formed, or whether the three banks will be responsible for handling the loans, will be decided after further consultations.</p>
<p>Credit Loans Incorporated into Operation</p>
<p>The Bankers' Association's credit loan program, organized through local associations and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, had already secured 1,885,000 dollars in pledges from member banks (5,000 dollars was added by a certain bank yesterday). Due to various reasons, the loan release had been delayed. According to news from the Bankers' Association yesterday, the government has now decided to release twenty million dollars in loans to aid industry and commerce. Fortunately, the goals are aligned, and the Bankers' Association intends to incorporate the funds it has raised into the five million dollar credit guarantee loan portion of the twenty million dollar loan, rather than organizing a separate operation, to simplify procedures.</p>
<p>Industry and Commerce Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>According to sources in industry and commerce, in order to seek relief, Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors had requested that the financial community provide property mortgage and credit loans. The Ministry of Finance has consulted with the financial community and decided to provide twenty million dollars for factory mortgage and credit guarantee loans. Although the amount is less than originally requested, given the urgent need for relief in industry and commerce, having twenty million dollars of circulating funds will be of great benefit. It is hoped that the authorities and the financial community will implement the plan as soon as possible to rescue industry and commerce and stabilize the market.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates Slightly Lengthened, Equalization Tax Unchanged</p>
<p>The Foreign Exchange Equalization Committee met at 10:00 AM yesterday and decided to maintain the equalization tax rate at 6.75%, the same as before. The Central Bank's telegraphic transfer selling prices, announced yesterday, all showed a lengthening of exchange rates. The rates are listed below: London: one national currency unit is one shilling seven and six two five pence, an increase of one two five pence from the previous day's one shilling seven and a half pence. New York: one hundred national currency units is 39.6875 US dollars, an increase of 0.3125 US dollars from the previous day's 39.375 US dollars. Paris: one hundred national currency units is 600 francs, an increase of six francs from the previous day. Berlin: one hundred national currency units is 98 marks, an increase of one mark from the previous day.</p>
<p>Over 300 Million Dollars of Silver Reserves in Shanghai</p>
<p>According to the Economic Research Office of the Central Bank, the total silver reserves of Chinese and foreign banks in Shanghai last week was 337,156 (unit: thousands of dollars, same below). Chinese banks held 286,792, while foreign banks held only 50,364, accounting for only one-sixth of the total.

<p>Yesterday (April 16th) was the ninth day of the Shanghai preview for the International Exhibition of Chinese Art held in London. A continuous stream of Chinese and Western ladies visited the exhibition. The following is an account of the news obtained yesterday:</p>
<p>Group Tickets Limited to Morning Hours</p>
<p>In order to give preferential treatment to schools and academic and artistic groups, the exhibition has established a preferential measure, issuing half-price group tickets at one dollar per person. However, these group tickets are valid only in the morning, except on Mondays when the exhibition is open in the afternoon. They cannot be used in the afternoon and will be invalid after the expiration date. The exhibition is issuing this statement to remind those who purchase group tickets.</p>
<p>Attention to This Preview Exhibition</p>
<p>This Shanghai preview of Chinese art contains approximately one thousand ancient artifacts, all from past dynasties, mostly collected by the Ming and Qing emperors. These are items rarely seen by the public, so their value is evident. The items are displayed in chronological order, making them very easy to view. As a result, it is receiving much attention from all sides. The Tianjin Ta Kung Pao published a special edition dedicated to the art exhibition preview, and the Shen Bao Pictorial Weekly also featured photographs of the exhibition's products. Various illustrated magazines are competing to contact the exhibition and request permission to print photographs of the various ancient artifacts. Yesterday, the Central Propaganda Committee also sent representatives to contact the exhibition about photography matters. The Shanghai General Post Office has also requested the exhibition to produce and sell postcards featuring photographs of the ancient artifacts. The exhibition is currently considering the matter.</p>

<p>Wang Zhengting Visited the Exhibition Yesterday</p>
<p>Former Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Zhengting and his wife visited the exhibition together yesterday morning, browsing for a long time. They expressed deep admiration for the displayed calligraphy, paintings, porcelain, jade, bronze ware, cloisonné, and ancient books. Yesterday, fifty students from the Shanghai Private Academy of Fine Arts also purchased group tickets to visit the exhibition.</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Explained the Reasons for the Fees</p>
<p>Mr. Tang Xifen sent a letter yesterday stating, "Dear Sir, I have been reading the Chinese and English newspapers for the past few days, and many people believe that the price of two dollars for our exhibition ticket is too high. The Preparatory Committee and staff of our exhibition have always held that artistic appreciation should ideally be without cost. However, this preview was not included in the budget, and the exhibition expenses must be covered by ticket revenue. The costs of repairing and renting the venue, display cabinets, security equipment, catalogue printing, specialized work, and the repair and transportation of exhibits, photography, and plate-making are estimated to be no less than 60,000 dollars. Considering the average daily ticket revenue of 1,500 dollars this week, a total of 30,000 dollars will still be lacking in twenty days (the exhibition only lasts twenty days). Furthermore, the printing cost for each Chinese catalogue is 60 cents, while the selling price is only 50 cents (the printing cost for the English catalogue is more expensive, and there are fewer buyers, resulting in even greater losses). As for student visits, they are all given a half-price discount. All of this is something that national museums and art exhibitions cannot do. In other words, our exhibition has made every effort to reduce the expenses of visitors in order to promote the popularization of artistic appreciation, even to the point of incurring losses. Facts speak louder than words. Furthermore, Shanghai is our country's largest metropolis, filled with dust and pollution. Parks are the supreme need for the health of citizens. However, Zhaofeng Park, Hongkou Park, French Park, and all parks charge entrance fees that are exorbitantly expensive. Moreover, the lack of public libraries, museums, art galleries, and children's playgrounds stands in stark contrast to the abundance of corrupting and demoralizing establishments. I have never heard Chinese or foreign individuals in Shanghai voice any objections. This is truly something that I personally find perplexing. I respectfully submit this to your attention and hope you will grant it publication. I wish you all the best in your writing."</p>

<h3 id="e122">Escaped Convict Arrested After Returning to Shanghai: Chen Jinlan, "Snake Skin Jinlan," Hid in Hankou After Escaping But Failed to Make a Living and Returned to Shanghai, Allowing His Capture <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The murderer Chen Jinlan from Ningbo, nicknamed "Snake Skin Jinlan," 32 years old, was arrested by the French police and prosecuted by the Second Special Court for shooting and killing Chen Zhikui, the owner of the Qianfengtai Incense Shop at 52 Dongxin Bridge Street in the French Concession on April 14, 1933, at approximately 9:00 PM. He was sentenced to fourteen years in prison after trial. The convict appealed, so he was detained in Cell No. 11 of the East Section of the Second Special Court Detention Center (attached to the Second Special Prison on Route Massenet). Subsequently, the Nanjing Supreme Court upheld the verdict after three trials, reducing the sentence to twelve years. During the period leading up to the execution of the sentence, the convict escaped from prison between 3:00 AM and 7:00 AM on December 27th of the previous year. After the discovery, the warden of the detention center transferred the on-duty guards Fang Yuqi and Zhou Wenjin to the Second Court Procuratorate for investigation. He also reported to the Third Branch Procuratorate of the High Court to issue warrants and request that military police, judicial, and other agencies throughout the country work together to apprehend the convict. Warden Gao Xiaoge was also removed from his post and investigated. After the prosecutor concluded the investigation of the two guards, Fang and Zhou, they were deemed to have colluded to facilitate the escape and were prosecuted according to law. The criminal court trial ended recently, sentencing Fang to two years and six months in prison and Zhou to two years in prison. These details have been reported in previous issues. After escaping, Chen fled to Hankou to make a living but failed. A few days ago, he secretly returned to Shanghai. On the 15th, French police detectives Lu Dongliang and Yang Zhongfang discovered that Chen was hiding in the home of his fellow villager Bian Wuchang (27 years old) on the upper floor of a carpenter shop at 32 Laoyong'an Street. They immediately reported to the Western Detective Chief and arrested him quietly at the address at 3:30 PM that afternoon. At the time, Chen attempted to escape by jumping out of the window but was captured by the two detectives. He resisted fiercely, injuring Detective Yang's finger with a bite. The detectives handcuffed him and bound him. The convict then surrendered. Bian Wuchang was also arrested for the crime of harboring a criminal. Both were taken back to the police station for detention and transferred to Criminal Court One of the Second Special Court yesterday. Presiding Judge Wang Gangxu conducted the interrogation (Judge Wang also presided over the first trial of the murder case). According to the police lawyer Gu Shouxi, the police department still needed to investigate the details of Chen Jinlan's escape and requested a postponement for temporary detention pending investigation. The court verified the ages and origins of the defendants and adjourned the hearing to April 26th for further investigation. The defendants were returned to custody. However, in order to understand how the convict was able to escape from a heavily guarded prison, the Chinese and Western detectives, along with Chen, went to the detention center at approximately 3:00 PM yesterday to have him demonstrate the details of his prison escape. It was also heard that in his statement to the police, the convict stated that after escaping, he hid on the Chongming ferry at the Dada Wharf in the South City for one night. At the same time, he sent a letter to his mother in Ningbo to request funds. Because of the high alert, he fled to a small inn on Zhejiang Road, where he borrowed money from friends to go to Hankou. For several months, he was unable to make a living, so he secretly returned to Shanghai. Now that Chen has been apprehended, the two guards, Fang and Zhou, who were imprisoned because of Chen, are appealing the verdict and are expected to have their sentences reduced in the future.</p>

<p>A report from the Central News Agency states that Han Debao from Zhejiang Province had been manufacturing highly addictive drugs. Last year, he rented No. 11 1/2, B, Huangjiasha, Route Edouard VII, and set up a factory to manufacture heroin, employing Wang Gensheng, Cai Qiusheng, Zhou Quanqiu, and others to assist in the work. On January 24th of this year, the Zhabei Police Station of the Public Concession discovered this, arresting Wang Gensheng and others and seizing drug-making equipment and drugs. The arrestees then revealed Han's address, and the police, together with the Caojiadu Branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, arrested Han Debao, his concubine Sun Wu, maid Wang Wu, and chauffeur Wang Xiangjin at No. 4, Juxian Village, Kang'nou'er Road. This was reported in previous issues. It is now known that the defendants in this case, Han Debao and the other three, were transferred by the Shanghai Public Security Bureau to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for trial. After thorough interrogation by the Military Law Department of the Headquarters, the defendants were convicted according to law. Defendant Han Debao was sentenced to death in accordance with Article 1 of the Provisional Regulations for the Strict Prohibition of Highly Addictive Drugs for manufacturing highly addictive drugs. The judgment was reviewed and approved by the Chairman's Headquarters of the Military Affairs Commission, and the prisoner Han Debao was executed by firing squad at the execution grounds at 8:00 AM yesterday by officers led by Commander Wu and many military policemen, who verified the identity of the prisoner. The Headquarters' announcement is recorded below:</p>

<p>Each year, the China Islamic Association sends pilgrims to Mecca to perform the Hajj. The China Travel Service handles all matters related to ship tickets and accommodations. The eighth group of pilgrims last year consisted of 137 Muslims, including Ma Ji, Ma Wenhui, Ma Tingxiang, Na Fangjin, Bai Chengyu, and Zhan Deshan. They departed from Shanghai on December 20th of the previous year aboard the Blue Funnel Line's "Philoctetes." It has now been three months and twenty-six days. After completing the Hajj, the pilgrims returned on the Blue Funnel Line's "Memnon," arriving in Shanghai at approximately 5:00 PM yesterday. The pilgrims transferred to the tower-connecting passenger steam launch and landed at the Customs Wharf. The Blue Funnel Line specially appointed Mr. Ma Cunliang as the group's translator. Everything was arranged by the travel agency. The pilgrims returned to the Islamic Mosque in the South City to rest. However, one member of the group drowned at sea en route, and one female member suffered a stomach ailment and was sent to the hospital for treatment upon arrival in Shanghai.</p>

<p>Since the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau initiated the New Life Group Wedding, the practice has become popular in other places. Tianjin, Peiping, Hankou, Wuxi, Jiading, and other places have begun preparations, and some have already started registering for the first sessions. This shows that this method is suited to popular sentiment and meets the needs. If it can be promoted throughout the country in the future, it will be able to significantly reform old customs and extravagance. The second group wedding in Shanghai will be held at 3:00 PM on May 1st in the Municipal Government Auditorium. Thirty-five couples are scheduled to participate. Registration for the third session has already begun and will close on April 30th. Because there is a limit of fifty couples per session, applicants should apply early.

Furthermore, in order to ensure that the ceremony is solemn, Mayor Wu instructed the Social Affairs Bureau to slightly revise the wedding regulations.</p>
<h3 id="e127">Xiang Sheng Bus Company Strike, Arrested Striking Drivers Conferring on Ways, Many Were Arrested After the Investigation Was Discovered <a href="#e127" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c127" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">127</a></h3>
<p>The drivers' strike at the Shanghai Xiang Sheng Bus Company occurred on the 11th of this month. In addition to recruiting a large number of drivers, the company hired two hundred White Russian bodyguards to prevent danger, but this was still ineffective. Car destruction and personal injury occurred daily, and many newly hired drivers were seriously injured. At 7:00 PM yesterday, Chinese Detective Chief You A'gen, Detectives Yang Dechun, Xu Dezhong, and others from the Zhabei Police Station, together with agents from the Political Department of the French Concession Police, arrested fifteen striking drivers who were conspiring to harm the Xiang Sheng Bus Company in Room 405 of the Dazhong Hotel at 245 Route Edouard VII: Qiu A'gen, Xiao Zishan, Chen Rong, Han A'lin, Xu Gengsheng, Cai A'dong, Qiu Yongwan, Zhou Liangmin, Jiang A'ning, Mao Jinbing, Li Zhongyue, Jiang Jilin, Gan Xinchang, Lian Zhuxin, and Zhang Fangxin. They were all taken back to the police station for detention and transferred to Criminal Court One of the First Special Court yesterday morning. Presiding Judge Feng Shide began the interrogation. According to the police lawyer Zhao Yaotang, since the strike at the Xiang Sheng Bus Company, there have been daily incidents of car destruction and personal injury. Yesterday, French police detectives He Yaohai and Fu Guheng discovered that the striking drivers were planning to deal with the Xiang Sheng Company at the Xiaoyao Hotel at 302 Xinqiao Street between 6:00 PM and 8:00 PM. They notified the Zhabei Police Station, which ordered detectives to arrest the suspects before 7:00 PM. At the time, several pieces of paper were found on the ground and in Xiao Zishan's bag, including a list of names of former drivers at the Xiang Sheng Company and a notice from Chen Kai, the former chief of the Xiang Sheng Company's Negotiation Department, calling for a meeting. After the suspects were arrested, Zhou Xiangsheng, the general manager of the company, went to the police station and identified Qiu A'gen, Xiao Zishan, Chen Ronglin, Han A'lin, Xu Gengsheng, and Cai A'dong as the leaders of the strike. Detectives He and Fu of the French police discovered on the 13th of this month that the suspects were meeting at the Xiaoyao Hotel at 302 Xinqiao Street and secretly listened from the next room. They saw Qiu A'gen calling the drivers to a meeting and then saw Xiao Zishan whispering to more than ten people near the escalator, demanding that they persist to the end and act against the Xiang Sheng Company in various ways. Detective He could identify Gan Xinchang as one of those present that day. The previous case in which the police prosecuted Yin Xuanqi and Xu Jinsheng for injuring Yang Jinsheng was also because Yin and Xu instructed Yang to join the strike group, but Yang refused and was beaten and seriously injured. Yin and Xu are currently at large. Because the police need to conduct a detailed investigation in this case, they request permission to detain the suspects until next Thursday in accordance with Chapter 6 of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Judge Feng verified the report, questioned the defendants briefly, and approved the detention.</p>

<p>At the Xingyi Inn, No. 117 Jielu Road, at 6 PM the day before yesterday, a young man arrived, dressed in a Western suit and carrying bedding and luggage. He booked room No. 51, paid the room fee, and registered himself as Guo Cen from Hunan Province, 27 years old, in the guest register. He then went out and did not return to sleep until around 9 PM. Unexpectedly, due to an unknown stimulus, he suddenly had a pessimistic thought and secretly swallowed sleeping pills to commit suicide. The next day at 1 PM, a tea server named Chen Daoqing went to ask if he wanted to extend his stay, but found the door tightly locked. After repeated knocks without response, suspicion arose. He immediately reported to the police, and detective Shen Dehui was dispatched to force open the door. They found Guo moaning on the bed. An ambulance was immediately called to rush him to Tongren Hospital, but the treatment was ineffective, and he died soon after. The detective found two bottles of sleeping pills and a note written in pencil in the deceased's pocket. It read, "Guoying, my dear, my parents are forcing me [to marry someone else]. I have no face to see you anymore. Farewell in the next life," indicating his suicide was likely due to disappointment in love. A menu from the Jingdu Yanbinlou Restaurant on Damalu Road, Xihu New Market, dated April 12th, was also found, suggesting he had come to Shanghai from Hangzhou. The body was transported to the Yuan Corpse Repository on Faelun Road. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor from the First Special District Court, along with forensic doctor Zhang Yan and clerk Wang Zuji, arrived to examine the body. After hearing the detective's report, Tang ruled that the deceased, Guo Cen, male, had indeed died from poisoning. Since there were no known relatives, the body was handed over to Pushan Villa for burial, and the belongings were confiscated by the police and handed over to the court for public claim.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Huangpu River Dredging Bureau ordered a world's largest dredger from the German Schichau Shipyard, which arrived in Wusong on the 14th. It is understood that the ship is currently still moored there. A trial run is scheduled for the 24th and 25th of this month. If there are no obstacles, it will be formally delivered. Measurement work at Shentan has also been completed, and dredging can begin at the end of the month. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Scheduled Trial Run and Delivery: The dredger is named "Jianshe" (Construction) and set sail for China on February 8th. Since arriving in Shanghai on the 14th, it has been moored in Wusong. The Huangpu River Dredging Bureau has scheduled a trial run in the Huangpu River starting on the 24th and 25th. If the results are good, the performance is satisfactory, and there are no other obstacles, it will be formally accepted.</p>
<p>Shentan Measurement Completed: Regarding the dredging of Shentan outside Wusongkou, because the project is enormous, the Hydrographic Department of the Navy assisted with the measurement and other work. The measurement has now been completed. The location of the shoal is southeast of Shentan, in a place called Tongsha Guansha, which is in the center of the Yangtze River estuary, 20 English miles from the Yangtze River mouth and 30 English miles from Wusongkou.

<h3 id="e131">Continued Hearing of the Yong'an Silver Company Case: Ou Jiancheng Surrenders Himself Yesterday; Recounts the Process of Establishing the Company; Ou Released on 30,000 Yuan Bail <a href="#e131" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c131" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">131</a></h3>
<p>After the Yong'an Silver Company went bankrupt, the company's directors, general manager, and deputy managers were sued by creditors for fraud and embezzlement in the First Special District Court. After repeated hearings, only Luo Huafang appeared and was released on 5,000 yuan bail. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan continued the hearing. The defendant Ou Jiancheng also surrendered himself along with Luo. However, the remaining defendants Deng Jingfang, Li Du, Mo Dehui, Wang Jiazhen, Lin Kanghou, Wang Yongxin, and others were still unable to be summoned to court. Ou Jiancheng was questioned, and he stated that the Yong'an Silver Company owed more than 230,000 yuan, while 186,000 yuan was owed to the company. If unpaid share subscriptions were included, the two would offset the original surplus. The company's registered capital was one million yuan, with international commodity securities as the main business. The directors of the board were elected by shareholders before September 2nd of last year, with Deng Jingfang as chairman, and Qian Youju and Ye Hancheng as managing directors. The company's founders were himself, Peng Genhui, Qian Youju, Ye Hancheng, and others. In addition to the four founders each subscribing to 5,000 yuan, each was responsible for soliciting shares from other founders. However, Peng Genhui's subscribed 5,000 yuan was never paid. Peng, Qian, and Ye each failed to fully subscribe to 10,000 yuan of the shares they were responsible for soliciting, but he himself solicited 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. For example, Deng Jingfang's initial subscription of 5,000 yuan, and the shares subscribed by Mo Dehui, Wang Jiazhen, Zhang Zilian, Gu Chuntao, and Jiang Qi were all fully paid. However, Lin Qiuhu's subscribed 25,000 yuan was only paid 5,000 yuan. Lin Kanghou himself did not subscribe to shares, but represented 2,500 yuan of equity. The company opened on September 8th of last year. At that time, the subscribed shares totaled more than 300,000 yuan, of which 180,000 yuan was subscribed in Shanghai, but only 104,500 yuan was received. Overseas Chinese in the Philippines subscribed to 150,000 yuan, but none was paid. The reason for the non-payment was that when the company opened, the Social Affairs Bureau discovered that it had not registered with the government and strictly ordered it to be shut down. This news was heard by those who subscribed to shares in the Philippines, who became suspicious of the company and did not pay the subscriptions. Therefore, at the time of opening, the company relied only on the subscriptions received in Shanghai. However, after deducting 20,000 yuan for start-up costs, only more than 80,000 yuan in cash remained. Therefore, at that time, in view of the weak financial resources, the company initially did a small amount of business, intending to wait until the subscriptions were fully collected, obtain registration approval, and then formally open. However, on December 11th, Jiande Bank went bankrupt, and the company's deposits of more than 60,000 yuan were wiped out. Affected by this, the company also suspended business. He previously served as Deputy General Manager of Jiande Bank. After resigning last summer, he initiated the organization of Yong'an Silver Company. However, at that time, if those who had subscribed to shares but not yet paid continued to pay, it would not have followed in Jiande's footsteps. Therefore, after the suspension of business, he went to the Philippines to urge the payment of subscriptions. Unexpectedly, the board of directors suspected that he was evading responsibility and published a warning in the newspaper, causing those who subscribed to shares in Hong Kong and the Philippines to lose trust in him. Although he tried to appeal, it was ultimately futile. Later, Gu Chuntao, at a board meeting, introduced Shen Chengfu's brother, Shen Zufufu, as manager. Shen agreed to subscribe to 40,000 yuan and attract 100,000 yuan in deposits. Deng Zhonghuan also continued to subscribe to 15,000 yuan. He personally advanced more than 3,800 yuan, which was sufficient for application. Unexpectedly, on the day of the resumption of business, Shen not only went back on his word and did not contribute a cent, but on that very day took away a promissory note for 10,000 yuan and 500 yuan in cash and has since avoided him. Luo Huafang and Wang Yongxin were both deputy managers hired by Shen, and so on. Judge Wu verified the statement and concluded that the sum of the two share subscriptions and various deposits, after offsetting the amount owed to others, was short by approximately 100,000 yuan. He then asked how the funds were used, and Ou claimed that they were used for all expenses and losses over several months. The court considered it necessary to verify the account books and the minutes of the board meetings to clarify the contents. It then ordered Ou Jiancheng to pay 30,000 yuan bail and rescheduled the hearing for the afternoon of April 30th.</p>
<h3 id="e132">The National Goods Promotion Association Rushes to Build a Venue: Determined to Hold the Opening Ceremony on Schedule <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai Federation of Chinese National Products Manufacturers and the Jiawu Quan Zhe Disaster Relief Association, which are organizing the Shanghai National Goods Movement Aid Relief Conference, have been actively carrying out various preparatory matters since the opening date was determined. The work is extremely intensive, and the venue construction is also underway. The association's news from yesterday is as follows:</p>
<p>License Received: Since the association determined the opening date to be the 22nd of this month and the venue construction to begin on the 16th, it specially applied to the Shanghai Municipal Bureau of Public Works for the issuance of a building permit. Yesterday morning, the association received miscellaneous permit No. 3657 in the South Shanghai District from the Municipal Bureau of Public Works, which has been hung at the venue construction site. The original text reads: (omitted above) Regarding the issuance of the permit, it is reported by Ge Futian (General Secretary of the Association) that 170 reed sheds are to be built in the Penglai Road area (omitted in the middle) in the South Shanghai District. An application has been submitted for the issuance of a permit. After surveying by this bureau, permission is granted to issue a permit for construction, limited to completion by April 22nd of this year and demolition by May 10th of this year. It is necessary to comply with the building regulations of this city, otherwise, the permit will be revoked. The permit is hereby issued to the Chinese National Products Manufacturers Association, Director Shen Yi, April 15th, 24th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Construction Plan: According to the person in charge of the association's design section yesterday, the venue construction project is because the conference period coincides with spring and summer, and rain is expected to be frequent. Therefore, all the reed sheds are made of double-layered oiled paper, and gutters and waterways are set up throughout the venue. A large amount of coal is paved on the ground to prevent rain accumulation. The surrounding distance of the venue from the original buildings is three or four meters. The main entrance is located at the Penglai Market entrance to facilitate contact and expand publicity. Two side entrances are set up at Yongning Road and Penglai Road, and eight Taiping entrances are set up around the perimeter. A lecture hall is built in the center of the venue, with a circumference of about ten square zhang, for inviting celebrities to give lectures and perform dramas. To the left of the lecture hall is a temporary station for the fire brigade, and to the right is a rest area for police detectives. The office and guest reception area are located on the strip in front of the lecture hall. Three main pedestrian paths, each three meters wide, and four smaller paths, each two and a half meters wide, are opened. A total of 170 spaces are built in the venue. Three memorial archways are built at the main entrance and the three side entrances to enhance the appearance. The project is being overseen by contractor Zheng Liankun, who is working day and night. It is expected that the project will be fully completed by the 20th of this month, and the opening ceremony will be held as scheduled on the 22nd.</p>

The construction drawings have been revised three times and submitted to the Construction Department for review. Recently, the Construction Department's instruction No. 401 was received, stating that all submissions have been received, and that the inspection results should still order attention to and revision of each point, and that a checklist should be issued, but the department does not urge the company to start construction early, and should allow bidding for construction to begin immediately. The company is directed to comply and report on the progress of the handling at any time for inspection, etc. It is heard that after the company received the approval, it is actively carrying out bidding procedures and will start construction immediately.</p>

<h3 id="e140">The Sino-French Savings Society Complies with Orders: Cancels Prize Savings; Will Operate Ordinary Savings in the Future <a href="#e140" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c140" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">140</a></h3>
<p>Regarding the ban on prize savings, since the resolution was made at the Second National Financial Conference last year, the Ministry of Finance instructed the competent department to draft specific measures to gradually order the prohibition. Savings societies that voluntarily change to ordinary savings should submit their own replacement measures to the Ministry for review and approval. Otherwise, the collection of new accounts will be suspended, and the existing accounts will be continued by the Trust Bureau of the Central Bank until the savings period expires. It is understood that the Sino-French Savings Society has now formulated replacement measures and will operate ordinary savings. Those who have previously joined the prize savings of the society will be transferred to special savings accounts from the date of cessation of prize draws. For those who originally deposited 15 yuan, 3 yuan and 7.5 cents will be deducted each month. For those who originally deposited 12 yuan, 3 yuan will be deducted each month, and so on by analogy. The repayment period will be shortened from 15 years to 14 years. An application has been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval. In addition, the Universal Savings Society is also reportedly planning replacement measures to comply with the laws and regulations of the Ministry of Finance.</p>
<h3 id="e141">The Shou Chang Steamer Returns to Shanghai and Suspends Service; Cargo Handlers and Stewards Dispersed; Old Stewards Complain to the Company That New Crew Members Can Only Return to Yichang <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>The Sanbei Company's Shou Chang Steamer, on this trip to Yichang, had its eighteen cargo handlers and stewards, dispatched by the local Seamen's Association on the grounds that the ship's port of registry was Yichang, disembark, forcibly occupy the passenger cabins, and expel the original crew's stewards. Now that the Shou Chang has returned to Shanghai, the Sanbei Company does not recognize these cargo handlers and stewards and has ordered them to return to Yichang immediately. The solutions are detailed below:</p>
<p>Stewards' Complaints</p>
<p>The twenty-four original Sichuan stewards of the Shou Chang, upon the ship's arrival in port yesterday, went as a group to the company to report to Manager Chu Keqing that the eighteen cargo handlers and stewards forcibly dispatched by the Yichang Seamen's Association on this return trip from Yichang to Shanghai, upon boarding the ship, immediately occupied seventeen passenger cabins, preventing the ship's stewards from attending to passengers. In Yichang, they even dragged the head steward to the union, forcibly compelling him to recognize the new personnel and dismiss the original stewards. The clothes and luggage of the original stewards were taken away indiscriminately by these people. They requested the company to make a decision.</p>
<p>Shou Chang Service Suspended</p>
<p>The Shou Chang, after arriving in Shanghai and unloading the goods transported from the upper Yangtze River, immediately suspended service and entered the shipyard for repairs. All shipboard officers were reassigned to the Fuyang Steamer. The stewards decided to temporarily disband to avoid providing the Yichang Seamen's Association-dispatched cargo handlers with a pretext for further action.</p>
<p>Stewards Return to Yichang</p>
<p>The eighteen cargo handlers and stewards dispatched by the Yichang Seamen's Association, after arriving in Shanghai with the ship, were unable to remain on board due to the need for the ship to enter the dock. Yesterday, they all left the ship and went ashore, temporarily staying in small inns in the 16th Puli area. Lacking funds, they found it difficult to stay for long and reportedly plan to return to Yichang by boarding the Fuyang when it goes upriver.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Liu Wenqing's Adopted Daughters Misbehave; Lawsuit Filed to Terminate Adoption; Youdong Withdraws Part of Termination Request; Youlin Files Countersuit Seeking Living Expenses <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>Liu Wenqing, a Fujian native who formerly held a position in the Ministry of the Navy, retired and came to Shanghai after the Fujian Incident, living as a recluse at No. 3 Rongfuli, Zhangjia Garden, Maitehesi Road, West Shanghai. On March 9th of this year, around 9:00 AM, Liu's twenty-two-year-old adopted daughter, Liu Youlin, and nineteen-year-old adopted daughter, Liu Youdong, suddenly disappeared simultaneously. Liu Wenqing reported this to the police and engaged a lawyer to publish a notice in the newspaper, declaring the termination of the adoption relationship with both Youlin and Youdong. He also filed a petition with the Civil Division of the First Special Court, requesting a ruling to approve the termination of the adoption. Later, Liu Wenqing discovered that Liu Youdong had been seduced and hidden by Chen Zhenghong, a Yangzhou native who operated an auto repair shop across the street. He reported this to the police, who, on March 26th, ordered detectives to arrest Chen Zhenghong and Liu Youdong. Liu Youlin was also found at the Donghai Inn in Yuegui Lane, Wuma Road. The next morning, they were escorted to the First Special Court. The police, according to Article 257 of the Criminal Law, prosecuted Chen for enticing Liu Youdong, a woman under twenty, to leave her guardian, and for engaging in sexual relations. The trial resulted in Chen being sentenced to one year of imprisonment. Considering it was his first offense, Liu Youdong was ordered to be taken back by her adoptive father, Liu Wenqing. However, Liu Youlin, because her adoptive father refused to continue the adoption, wandered homeless and also engaged a lawyer to criminally accuse her adoptive father, Liu Wenqing, in the First Special Court of instigating murder and other crimes. After receiving the indictment, the court ruled that Liu Youlin and Liu Wenqing were relatives and, according to the law, could not sue each other. Therefore, the court rejected Liu Youlin's suit. Yesterday morning at 9:00 AM, Judge Mo Runhua presided over the Fourth Civil Court to try Liu Wenqing's case requesting the termination of the adoption of Liu Youlin and Liu Youdong. Liu Wenqing was absent and sent lawyers Dong Yu and Yao Junyu to represent him in court and present the case, requesting approval for the termination of the adoption. Subsequently, Liu Youdong testified that she still lived with her adoptive father, had now repented, and was willing to abide by family rules and had obtained her adoptive father's understanding. Judge Mo then turned to Liu Wenqing's representative lawyer to inquire about his opinion, who stated that Liu Youdong's will was weak and she had not thoroughly awakened. On the 6th of this month, she had received a phone call from Chen Zhenghong and left alone, although she returned shortly thereafter, but she was still secretly communicating with Chen, with lingering attachments, and there was fear of future changes. He requested that she be ordered to clearly express that if there were any more improper behaviors in the future, the adoption should be unconditionally terminated. Upon hearing this, Liu Youdong immediately stated that she had repeatedly considered this matter and was determined to repent. The plaintiff's representative lawyer then requested that the termination of the adoption of Liu Youdong be withdrawn, while the termination of the adoption of Liu Youlin should still proceed. Liu's mother was purchased as a maid by the plaintiff's mother when she was over ten years old. Later, because the plaintiff had no daughters and saw that she was of good quality, she was adopted as an adopted mother. Unexpectedly, after adulthood, her temperament changed drastically, and she often went out on her own. Moreover, this time Youdong's relationship with Chen Zhenghong was also introduced by Youlin. Therefore, the plaintiff, in order to maintain his reputation and family rules, requested the termination of the adoption. Liu Youlin then filed a counterclaim against Liu Wenqing, arguing that Youlin was a weak woman with no ability to support herself. If the adoption were terminated, she would have no means of living and would have to study in order to find a way out in the future. Therefore, she demanded that Liu Wenqing pay her a lump sum of 36,000 yuan for living and educational expenses. After the lawyers for both sides debated, Judge Mo announced that the judgment would be announced on Saturday morning of this week.</p>

<p>The Douglas aircraft that China National Aviation Corporation recently transported to Longhua for assembly was completed a few days ago and immediately underwent a test flight. The company has also ordered four Peixiaer aircraft from the United States, which will be successively shipped to Shanghai. A Central News Agency reporter recently learned the details from the company's authorities as follows:</p>
<p>Douglas Jumbo Jet Test Flight</p>
<p>The Douglas jumbo jet, since being transported to Longhua Airport for assembly, took two weeks to complete. It was completed a few days ago and underwent a test flight at noon a few days ago, soaring and circling for half an hour with satisfactory results. It is reported that this was the first test flight, and several more will be conducted in the coming days to ensure skilled operation. It will also be used to entertain people from all walks of life in Shanghai and Pingliang for trial rides, but the date has not yet been determined. Whether it will be officially added to the Shanghai-Pingliang route on the first of next month has also not been determined.</p>
<p>Expansion of Air Routes; Four Aircraft Ordered</p>
<p>The aircraft can accommodate fourteen passengers and four crew members, including the pilot and radio operator, for a total of eighteen people. It can also carry a large amount of mail, and each seat has a window for viewing. It has two engines, each with 750 horsepower, totaling 1,500 horsepower. The style is new and the equipment is perfect. In order to expand its air routes, the company has also ordered four Peixiaer seaplanes from the United States, which are expected to be shipped to Shanghai one after another starting at the end of this month.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau Implements Plant Pest and Disease Inspection Starting on the 20th of This Month <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>Plant pest and disease inspection originated in Germany, followed by France, Austria, the United States, Sweden, and Belgium. Our country has not yet implemented it. As a result, pests and diseases such as the red bollworm and corn smut are imported along with overseas plants, spreading widely and causing increasing damage. The losses suffered by Chinese farmers are incalculable. As for exported plants, there is no legal agency to inspect and certify them, and farmers are unaware of prevention and control measures, resulting in those with attached insects and bacteria being either completely destroyed by the importing country or ordered to be shipped back. In severe cases, imports are even prohibited, which reduces foreign trade. On the other hand, pests attached to foreign goods are imported in a steady stream, without anyone stopping them. Our country has almost become a dumping ground for the world's inferior plants, which is truly deplorable. Therefore, the implementation of plant pest and disease inspection in our country is urgently needed in terms of business needs. The Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau of the Ministry of Industry entrusted experts to begin preparations in October of the 21st year of the Republic of China. Due to various factors such as investigation and design funding, personnel, and contact with various countries in the East and West, everything has only recently been finalized. The detailed inspection rules have now been submitted to the Executive Yuan for record and are scheduled to be implemented starting on the 20th of this month. The Bureau has sent these detailed rules to the Jianghai Customs to request its review and assistance, and has also sent them to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to forward them to relevant merchants.</p>
<h3 id="e148">Wu and His Son Go Abroad to Investigate the Development of Agriculture and Eradication of Leprosy in Hainan Island, and Give a Talk to Reporters <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>Qiongya, a remote island county, is the largest island in our country, with fertile land and abundant mineral resources. According to our country's statistics, the annual import of rubber, coffee, coconut oil, etc., exceeds 100,000 yuan. Moreover, the businesses of overseas Chinese are becoming increasingly difficult. If they can return to their homeland and start actively developing the island, it would be a way to seek an economic outlet for the nation and reclaim our rights and interests. It is believed that foreign industrialists in our country will agree with this idea. Now, Wu Xianshou, an agricultural expert from Hainan, plans to go abroad to investigate the actual conditions of industries in various places for in-depth research, so that he can learn from them. Mr. Wu arrived in Shanghai yesterday and is scheduled to take the Deliya north during the day, first to Qingdao and Dalian, and then to East Po, Japan, according to Mr. Wu.</p>
<p>Investigate Agriculture: Qiongya is the only tropical region in our country, with fertile land, a mild climate, and abundant mineral resources. Recently, the local area has become peaceful. If we can engage in mining and planting as much as possible, such as rubber, coffee, cinchona, coconut, and sugarcane, the future is full of unlimited hope. Although my brother and I previously studied agriculture at Lingnan Agricultural College in Guangzhou and the Agricultural College of the Philippines, after returning to China, we engaged in self-operated farms, planting and raising livestock. The results of four years of experimentation have been very satisfactory and gratifying. Now, for the sake of learning from others, we are going to Japan, Taiwan, and other places to investigate local planting, animal husbandry, agricultural product manufacturing, water and electricity, etc. Japan has many situations similar to China, so we are going there to learn from them.</p>
<p>Study Leprosy: Accompanying Mr. Wu on this trip is his father, Wu Weifan, the owner of Guanghui Drugstore in Haikou, Qiongzhou. He has been working hard to help leprosy in Qiongya and is the founder of the Qiongya Leprosarium. He told the interviewer yesterday that in the 21st year of the Republic of China, my brothers invited various Chinese and Western circles in Qiongya to organize a leprosarium construction committee. With donations of 20,000 yuan from local people, the Shanghai China Leprosy Relief Association, and philanthropist Hu Wenhu, we built eight dormitories and one treatment center. Recently, the Guangdong Provincial Government allocated 6,000 yuan, and we are now accommodating more than 100 male and female lunatics. My brothers are going north this time to report on the situation to the Shanghai China Leprosy Relief Association and go to Japan, Taiwan, and other places to investigate leprosy relief and treatment methods to learn from them.</p>
<p>Separate Introduction Letters: It is reported that Mr. Wu and his son once went to Guangdong to meet with Pacification Director Chen Jitang and personally sent a letter to Mr. Kawasai Tatsuo, the Japanese Consul-General in Guangzhou. Mr. Kawasai then wrote letters to the Kobe Maritime Police Department and the Governor-General of Taiwan, requesting them to provide proper hospitality at that time to facilitate the investigation. The Hong Kong Chinese General Chamber of Commerce also sent separate letters to the Chinese Embassy in Japan, the Taiwan Chinese Chamber of Commerce, etc.</p>
<h3 id="e149">Xu Yabo Encoffined Yesterday <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>After Mr. Xu Yabo, the former First District Chief of the Jiangsu Water Police, passed away at his residence at 7:00 PM on the 13th, his remains were transported by his old friends, relatives, and disciples to the Shanghai Funeral Home at No. 838 Xujiahui Road. He was encoffined yesterday (the 16th) at 2:00 PM. About two to three hundred guests attended, such as Chen Qun, Yuan Xilian, Xie Qianggong, Zheng Kangnian, Hao Huafo, etc. The funeral staff, such as Zhang Binghui, Lin Meicun, Wu Hezhong, Wu Zhonglong, Zhu Ying, Hu Bairen, Jiang Liusheng, Zhu Rongping, Zheng Guohua, Zhu Wenqing, etc., took on the roles of General Affairs, Documentation, Reception, and Ceremonial Affairs, with great enthusiasm. After Mr. Xu's remains were encoffined, the coffin was transported to the Minhang Funeral Home for temporary placement, and a date will be chosen later for the memorial service and burial. It is also heard that Mr. Xu's teacher, General Wu Ziyu, also sent a telegram of condolence upon hearing the news. It is reported that Mr. Xu left behind a wife, two daughters, and two sons, all in difficult circumstances. The two daughters are still unmarried, and the two sons are still young. The orphans are struggling to make ends meet, and the situation is extremely tragic. In addition, Mr. Xu's younger brother, Mingbo, rushed from Chuansha upon hearing the news to attend the funeral.</p>

<h3 id="e159">Random Musings on "Romanticism" <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>— Junchong</p>
<p>When discussing Romanticism in art, we must be aware that, just as Realism in art does not necessarily align with Materialism in philosophy, Romanticism in art is not the same as Idealism in art. In fact, certain Romantic art (such as the fantastical Romantic literature of German Idealism in the early 19th century) embodies an Idealist approach, but at the same time, the facts of art history also show that Romantic works characterized not by a delusional reflection of objective reality, but by an emphasis on the "possibilities" and "driving forces of development" contained within reality itself (such as Shelley and Heine's lyrical poetry) belong to Idealist Romantic art. In art history, it has always been a declining class, due to its historical mission. When it has lost its progressiveness and begins to move towards its own grave, it dares not face reality, and thus indulges in the grand longing for past achievements and the fascination with ruins, emitting an anti-historical evolutionary art trend. In this kind of Romantic art, it is not, as Mr. Xin Ren said, "because it is itself a part of darkness, so even though their 'utopia' takes on various forms, in essence, it is an ode to blackness." It also contains this kind of "utopia" -- a feeling that there is a need to cleanse this darkness, but they do not objectively observe reality, see the driving force of history, and entrust their realistic utopia to it, but instead start from their own subjective ideas and subjectively fantasize about the artistic expression of objective reality.</p>
<p>In evaluating progressive Romanticism, it is necessary to first pay attention to its historical development and the changes in its historical essence. The Romanticism of the rising stage of a new class and the Romanticism of the construction stage of the highest society after grasping political power are somewhat different in nature. What can be said to be the characteristic of early Romanticism is an ardent, great, sublime ideal of realizable possibilities that stimulates the artist's emotions in real life, an "emotional" emphasis and expression. It is precisely because of this "emotional emphasis" that what is embodied in the early Romanticism of the rising class is often a more abstract, sublime ideal of longing, a eulogy for the birth of a bright future with a terrible heat. This "emotional emphasis" is precisely the characteristic of early Neo-Romanticism. Of course, this characteristic also varies due to the individual writer's qualities, talents, and technical proficiency.</p>
<p>The Neo-Romanticism currently being advocated is, to some extent, different from early Neo-Romanticism. Currently, Neo-Romanticism is being treated as one element of Realism, as a colorful, abundant, and unrestrained creative method. The reason why current Neo-Romanticism is different from early Neo-Romanticism is because the romance that is the object of Romanticism is no longer just something "possible" existing in reality itself, but has become an element of objective reality. Romance not only exists in the present and will be realized in the future as something "possible," but already exists in reality. It is precisely because this element of romance is inherent in objective reality that Romanticism is being explained as an element of Realism. Therefore, at this time, "emotional emphasis" is no longer the only characteristic of Romanticism. At this time, Romanticism has become inseparable from Realism and has been integrated and synthesized into Realism. Because, from the standpoint of "reflection theory," if Realism at this time is to see through and express the social and human reality, then it must inevitably be the reason for Romanticism.</p>
<p>On this point, I agree with Mr. Xin Ren's saying: "Any emerging literature in history is necessarily 'realistic and romantic.'" However, I will only add a little restriction here: "Realistic and romantic" is the characteristic of emerging literature in history, but it is necessary here to see through its historical development and the essential changes that come with that development, and we cannot be satisfied with "realistic and romantic" as a characteristic of the literature of every emerging class in history. At the same time, we should also pay attention to its "realistic" historical class limitations. Only by explaining this point can we fully understand the essential difference between Burr's Realism and Neo-Realism. Especially in the former point (i.e., the historical development of the Romanticism of the emerging class and the essential changes that come with this development) must be given deep attention. I think that Mr. Xin Ren's view of the Romanticism of the emerging class as a kind of "utopia" that is a "passionate 'longing' for light through dark reality" is only the initial form of the Romanticism of the new class, not the entire posture of its entire development. Without understanding this point, without understanding the historical development and qualitative changes of Neo-Romanticism, it is impossible to understand the current Neo-Romanticism.</p>

<p>— Wang Ying</p>
<p>Unwilling to talk about the pain of life, everyone likes to see smiling faces - even if that smile is very strenuous - I understand the so-called "survival" of more of this reason, therefore, how many times, I picked up the pen, and finally could not write a decent thing.</p>
<p>Living in a gloomy mood, tears can flow endlessly into the heart like a river; in the cold and lonely late night, facing the lightless lamp, crying out loud, but, in the crowd, you have to laugh pleasantly, even so, you still can't live a little better; you have to drag out a meager existence in the midst of falls and slanders, in the midst of bullying and blows. The whole era is in suffering, so, how are the young people living in this era being tormented to the point of being unable to breathe.</p>
<p>In Tokyo, I saw a new Russian film, titled "Survival," I remember very clearly, I ran for two days, bought four tickets, and finally bought a seatless admission ticket. It was winter, and the theater did not have heating or other facilities, but, it was steamed with the crowd of people, sweating, the film was only a play with three people, and it was the passing things in two hours, using the sound of the clock walking, to seize the emotions of the audience; the general idea is this: everyone, - to put it more broadly, every living thing - needs to yearn for "survival," but, today's world has these two kinds of people, one kind is only concerned with their own survival, and does not care about the survival and death of others, and even deprives others of the right to survive; one kind hopes that everyone lives. However, we are unfortunately surviving in the control of the society of these kinds of people who "only care about their own survival."</p>
<p>It seems that I have not lived a good day since I was pushed into this crowd of people with bloody mouths. This world has no distinction between "black and white" or "right and wrong," and what you touch every second is only gray and hazy, and it is a gloomy, never-ending black night with heavy fog. What surrounds us here is boundless cold and melancholy. Facing this endless night, I am already occasionally moaning without being able to make a sound.</p>
<h3 id="e161">Qingdao's Park <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>Let the surprisingly large sandy road lead us into the German locust forest. Unnamed little birds are happily chirping where they cannot be seen. On the trees that have not yet sprouted leaves, there are large bird nests, and magpies with white bellies and black feathers quietly fall to the ground, pecking at something, and then quietly fly up again. Occasionally, two horses pull a clumsy cart loaded with stones, and walk out with a jerk in the shouts of rough men, but after a while, they return to silence again. If you walk to a higher place and look out from the branches, the pine-covered hillside and the green sea surface are all around not far away, appearing as if they are exhausted.</p>
<p>Who would think of it as visiting a park like this? It's simply like taking a long trip in the mountains and forests.</p>
<p>Qingdao's First Park is really lovely. It covers an area of about 1,600 acres, with many roads in the middle, which can be used for cars. Each road is named after a flower, such as Ginkgo Road, Begonia Road, Plum Blossom Road, and Cherry Blossom Road. The day we went was when the cherry blossoms were in full bloom. It had rained last night, and the roads were slightly damp, so the strolling tourists were lucky enough not to eat the dust swept up by the cars, as they used to.</p>
<p>Spring in the north is very late. The peach blossoms and elm leaf plum blossoms still have a timid and cold look, half revealing their red faces. The only ones that compete with the exotic cherry blossoms are the golden bell flowers of goose yellow and the blood-like azaleas. Imagining the south of the Yangtze River at this time, isn't it the "late spring in March" when "various flowers grow on trees and groups of orioles fly around"? But there are still people who deliberately run from the south to this place to see the spring scenery for two or three days and then return in a hurry. In the eyes of those who live in the north, it is a bit silly. However, it is still smarter to spend the money that could be used to relieve disaster victims in this way.</p>
<p>Probably because of the morning, there are few modern men and women in the park. Most of those who walk slowly under the cherry blossom trees are ordinary businessmen and rough men from the countryside. From this point, Qingdao Park's ability to share happiness with everyone, unlike Shanghai Park, which requires money to play, is worthy of praise.</p>
<p>Here, we also saw old women stamping their small feet, which were once praised by guests at the time of their marriage, messily on the sandy road covered with petals. Perhaps people do not feel deeply painful about this yet. Some young girls are also hobbling with a pair of unnatural feet, tracing the footsteps of their grandmothers. This is not very common in the park, but it is quite common in the places where ordinary people live. According to Ye Gongchuo's "Qingqiu Travel Fragments," "The municipal government actively persuades people to unbind their feet, declaring that after a certain period of time, people will be sent to sun and test whether it has been implemented, and female staff will be sent to check. There are even those who hanged themselves for fear of the test, and those whose fathers and brothers who did not unbind their feet by the deadline were detained and fined ten yuan, and they vented their anger on the women after returning, forcing them to commit suicide. Therefore, the municipal government can only proceed slowly." The simplicity of the northerners is respectable, but the degree of stubbornness is frightening.</p>
<p>On the way back, we picked up two peach branches with buds on the side of the seaside park (probably discarded by the villagers after being scolded by the police), inserted them in a bottle, and let spring be with us for some time.</p>
<h3 id="e162">Mr. Juqing (15) <a href="#e162" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c162" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">162</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ling</p>
<p>Before he even got home, a student came running in a panic to tell him: The teacher from the school had already caught a private tutor at his house. – An even bigger surprise attack!</p>
<p>Hearing the news, as quickly as lightning, Mr. Juqing's iron-green complexion turned deathly pale. He stopped, without saying a word. In an extremely short period of time, two questions agitated in his mind: Go back? Not go back?</p>
<p>His whole body was as scorched as if on fire. After a long while, he finally walked towards his house.</p>
<p>There were three young teachers in the room, one thin and tall, and one small with eyebrows and eyes turned upside down, individually rummaging through the students' desks and drawers, searching for ancient books such as "Primer of Juvenile Studies" and "Mencius" to clip under their arms: still the old method of investigating private tutors. More than a dozen students stared at them with wide eyes. Principal Zhang was wearing a dark blue serge student uniform, and inserting both hands into his trouser pockets, a posture that added a bit of arrogance to his demeanor. Mr. Juqing ran in, and he was stretching out one foot in front, as if at "ease," not knowing what he was interrogating Mrs. Juqing about.</p>
<p>When Mr. Juqing stepped into the study, everyone was stunned for a moment. A momentary silence in the tense air.</p>
<p>The person who came in was panting breathlessly, and it took him a long time to catch his breath. Forcibly calming himself, he squeezed out a trace of a bitter smile, cupping his hands and saying:</p>
<p>"Please sit, please sit, gentlemen."</p>
<p>Facing the old man's humble demeanor, Principal Zhang felt that it was not necessary to be polite at all. He straightened his chest, as if his body had grown a lot.</p>
<p>"I won't sit." His head nodded slightly downward (others couldn't see it at all), considering it a nod: "We are here to investigate."</p>
<p>"Yes, yes." Mr. Juqing tried his best to appear amiable, "We will slowly improve everything."</p>
<p>The weak sunlight near dusk shone softly on the corner of the wall, and the study already looked dusky. In the short time of silence, Mr. Juqing used the greatest patience to calm himself, anxiously thinking about how to peacefully deal with the current situation; but Principal Zhang was feeling slightly perplexed by Mr. Juqing's overly humble attitude. There was a surge of unstable fire in his heart, looking for an opportunity to erupt.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Notes on the Exhibition of Chinese Art at the International Exhibition <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>— Cao Juren</p>
<p>Exhibiting ancient Chinese art to gentlemen, ladies, young masters and young mistresses, is originally like playing the lute to a cow. In the two hours I spent at the exhibition, I heard several young mistresses lamenting: "Really nothing to see! Really nothing to see!" Two dollars is originally nothing to them; but they always feel that it is more reasonable to spend these two dollars to see Mei Lanfang's opera or to watch dancing, dog racing, etc. Their opinions are of the following types:</p>
<p>"The portraits are painted very realistically!"</p>
<p>"So, these are truly Tang Bohu and Zhu Zhishan's paintings!"</p>
<p>"This person is indeed very famous!"</p>
<p>"Was Emperor Taizu of Song the same as Emperor Hongwu?"</p>
<p>"Emperor Taizu of Song was Zhao Kuangyin."</p>
<p>"Zhao Kuangyin on the stage has a red face, why is this person's face not red at all?"</p>
<p>"What's the point of these broken copper and scrap iron dug out of the mud?" (Referring to the bronzes unearthed from Xinzheng)</p>
<p>In addition, there are connoisseurs who are half-baked scholars, and they also have various opinions:</p>
<p>"Qianlong and Yongzheng were truly talented emperors. Look, there are 'Treasures viewed by the Emperor' on them."</p>
<p>"This poem is well written."</p>
<p>"Zhao Mengfu's (they pronounce it Tao) calligraphy is nothing special, but it has a talent's air."</p>
<p>"This is a true Song edition of Mr. Wu Liu's biography." (Copied down with a fountain pen)</p>
<p>"This is called oracle bone, used for divination." (Referring to a piece of cattle bone.)</p>
<p>"This is called and that is called a cauldron. What's the point?"</p>
<p>"Jade is still more beautiful than bronze."</p>
<p>These are generally the kinds of discussions made by the three or four hundred noble viewers; I seemed to hear the artworks sighing. This is truly not an exhibition of ancient Chinese art, but rather an exhibition of the foolishness, baseness, and ignorance of some city residents who are tired of eating fish and meat. This is the inevitable result of the two-dollar ticket price: those who truly appreciate art and truly want to understand ancient culture are all kept outside the door, unable to come in and take a look!</p>
<p>Looking at all the exhibits at the exhibition, the calligraphy and painting section has inevitably taken up too much space. There are indeed very good pieces in the calligraphy and painting; but it is too much to introduce works on paper as Chinese art. Europeans have already seen Chinese murals, woodcuts, and various other things. Why only introduce works on paper? Chinese collectors and connoisseurs in the past had very poor aesthetic knowledge; many of the so-called precious works were actually just tricks colluding with each other among collectors and connoisseurs, and had very little real value. Treasures viewed by the Emperor are even less reliable; whatever Qianlong appreciated, many ministers followed suit in praising; but what he appreciated was often the worst, partly due to his incompetence, and partly due to his despotism. Collectors all have a common problem: whatever they collect is the best in the world; although many works have been commented on by many collectors, they are still highly untrustworthy. Collectors rarely have a historical perspective; they do not understand the path of Chinese art development. If the arrangement and classification are not appropriate, it will make the viewer unable to grasp any concept. The chaotic arrangement of the calligraphy and painting section is enough to prove the aesthetic ability of the connoisseurs.</p>
<p>The arrangement of the exhibits in each room, with the archaeological items selected by the Academia Sinica as an example, is the most refined and organized, and is obviously the work of archaeological experts. The arrangement of the bronzes section is also very appropriate, and the textual research work is done very meticulously; this is enough to show the progress in the study of artifacts in the past thirty years. The ancient book section does not specialize in Song and Yuan editions, but lists various engraved editions and fine transcriptions. This is the best way to explain the cultural aspects; we must admire the vision of the person who arranged it. Naturally, the best-arranged is what the Shanghai citizens ignore the most; however, I do not believe that after arriving in London, the British academic community will reverse the original values like the Shanghai compradors; the bronze section at least should give Western archaeologists some new stimulation!</p>

<h3 id="e168">Sun Hanbing's Lecture Yesterday: How to Study Political Science <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday marked the eighth day of the National Reading Movement Conference, organized by the China Cultural Construction Association. The association specially invited Sun Hanbing to lecture on how to study political science. The following is a record of his speech:</p>
<p>Subject and Content</p>
<p>Ladies and gentlemen, I am honored to be invited by the China Cultural Construction Association to give this lecture on how to study political science. I will now talk about it in simple terms. There is an old Chinese saying, "If you are not in the position, do not plan its affairs." In fact, these two sentences are not very suitable for present-day China. If every citizen is so passive and irresponsible towards national politics, how can national politics get on the right track? Today's China needs citizens who are responsible and proactive towards national affairs. They need to have a sense of responsibility and a proactive attitude towards national affairs. Then, we, as general citizens, must have sufficient political knowledge to understand and study the national situation and the world's trends. Therefore, studying politics can be said to be a requirement for modern people and a common-sense that citizens should possess. As for the subject and content of studying political science, what exactly is it? To understand the meaning of the two words "politics," it refers to the coercive dominance or ruling relationship among human beings. In every society, the materially or intellectually stronger always want the weaker to obey their will and be subject to their power. The strong rule the people, and the weak are ruled by the people. The political life of mankind begins with the division between rulers and the ruled. This is an ironclad fact that we cannot deny. When necessary, the ruler can use their supreme power to enforce their policies and achieve their goals through methods such as imprisonment, exile, and execution. They can be absolutely free from the control of others. However, rulers cannot abuse their power and are subject to various restrictions imposed by the customs, habits, and morals of the time. In a given society, an individual or a group of people uses their power to rule over the rest of the people, which we collectively call politics. Therefore, political science is the social science that studies the coercive ruling or dominating relationships among human beings. The content of political science can be roughly divided into three types: political science, political philosophy, and political technology. Political science studies the political life of mankind in the past and present, and finds out the causal relationships and the laws of change. Principles of political science, political history, and the history of political thought all belong to political science. Political philosophy, on the other hand, is based on value judgments and comprehensively explores the pure theoretical foundations and ultimate nature of political phenomena. In ordinary political science books, scientific research and philosophical arguments are often mixed together, but in theory, there is a big difference between the two. Political technology studies the practical organization and governance of public affairs, as well as methods for achieving specific goals. For example, public administration and political policy science belong to this category. Therefore, specifically speaking, the questions that political science seeks to answer can be briefly listed as follows: What are the interrelationships of human political life? What exactly is the organization of human political life called the state? Do all human beings in the world, regardless of race, belief, or cultural level, have various similar political organizations? If so, what is the reason for the universal existence of such political organizations? The occurrence and evolution of the state, the relationship between the ruler and the ruled, the organization of the government and its duties, etc., are all issues that those who study politics must study.</p>
<p>Research Methods</p>
<p>The general research method is none other than the scientific method. The so-called scientific method is deduction and induction. Ordinary people often regard these two methods as incompatible, but this is a misconception. It should be known that there is actually only one method of research, which is divided into three steps: first, the observation of facts; second, the establishment of hypotheses; and third, the mutual verification of the observed facts and the established hypotheses to see if they are consistent. However, this is a general research method that can be applied to social sciences, natural sciences, and even methods of conduct. However, the study of specialized subjects should have specialized methods, the so-called technical methods. The specialized methods of studying political science are now described as follows: The first is the method of observation. Observation is the foundation of scientific research. It is to observe and investigate the actual situation of things from the standpoint of an observer and with an objective attitude, record what is observed, and then carry out various sorting and analysis. The second is the method of statistics, which is the method of collecting, analyzing, and helping to explain social facts in the form of quantities. Although the statistical method cannot directly discover the causal relationship of political or social phenomena for us, it expresses complex social and political phenomena in extremely simple and easy-to-understand numerical forms, which is indeed an important and good tool for researchers of social science. The third is the method of comparison, which is to study the various political and social systems or lives of the present or the past, compare their similarities and differences, in order to obtain ordinary and definite conclusions. The fourth is the historical method, which is to search for materials about the facts to be studied from various historical records. The historical method can not only make me know the origin and the background of the development of a system, but also provide us with many reference materials to explain the phenomenon of the present society. The methods of studying political science are probably as described above. In short, the methods of research vary according to the difference of the subject matter, and are constantly changing with the wisdom and spirit of human research.</p>
<p>Practical Application</p>
<p>No matter what kind of theory, its highest value and greatest purpose lie in practice. The purpose of our studying political science is how to rationalize, beautify, and idealize the political life of mankind. Speaking of practice, we cannot but pay attention to the needs and limitations of time and space. Assuming that we forget the dominion of time and space, it is an impossible fantasy that will not work. For example, direct democracy is indeed a very good system in itself, with all people directly participating in politics, but this system is definitely not applicable to any country. For example, our China, if we now immediately implement direct democracy, I am convinced that the benefits of direct democracy will not be seen, and the abuses will be numerous. Therefore, no matter what kind of science, its highest value and greatest purpose are in practice, but as a prerequisite for practice, we cannot forget the needs and dominion of time and space. That's all.</p>

<p>The North China Volleyball Champion Nanmin Team, this time on a difficult journey south to Tianjin, Beijing, and Shanghai, was invincible wherever it went, winning victories. After arriving in Shanghai, it first defeated Dongya and then Jiangwan. Yesterday, it met with the Yangshupu Volleyball Team at Shanghai University. The Yangshupu Volleyball Team knew in advance that Nanmin was indeed very strong, so it specially gathered elites from Shanghai University, Yinghua, Soochow, and other schools into one group, forming a strong team to give it its all. It finally defeated Nanmin, but the battle was quite arduous. The Nanmin Team was not accustomed to fighting in the heavy rain that day, and at the same time, the Yangshupu Team gathered the elites of the city to compete against it, resulting in its defeat. The situation at that time was extremely exciting and rare. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>First Game: The battle began at four o'clock. The Yangshupu team served first. Mai Bingyao, Li Xizhao, and Huang Hanming bravely attacked. The Nanmin team cautiously defended and was not attacked. Then, the Yangshupu team's ball was too fierce, and the front row committed suicide and lost one point. Afterwards, Nanmin's Liu Zhicong worked hard and scored one point after another. Later, Yangshupu went straight to the clouds and took the lead with five to one. Nanmin quickly caught up, making it three to six. Afterwards, Yangshupu's Zheng Yiquan worked hard to advance, forming an advantage of nine to four. Nanmin launched three balls, and the momentum was fierce, increasing by three points in a row, making it seven to nine. Afterwards, through the fierce blocking of the middle row generals, it created a tie of nine to nine. Before long, Yangshupu took the lead with eleven to nine. Switching sides and fighting again, Nanmin's repeated kills were strictly prevented by the opponent, resulting in suicide, which made Yangshupu an advantage of sixteen to nine. Nanmin was not willing to be outdone, taking the lead and chasing to thirteen to sixteen. Yangshupu went straight up, and finally ended the game with twenty-one to fourteen. Yangshupu took the first game.</p>
<p>Second Game: After the serve, Nanmin tried to counterattack. The middle row wings succeeded one after another. Liu Zhicong in the front row also took the opportunity to block. In an instant, they led with nine to four. The two guards of Yangshupu are old hands in this area. They linked up and attacked, displaying their magical abilities, chasing to eleven to eight, only three points behind. After switching sides, Yangshupu went down in one go and took the lead with sixteen to fourteen. After entering, Nanmin once revived, calmly fighting back, and the score increased to a tie of twenty to twenty-three. Wei Dingyi took the opportunity to serve and gained two points. Yangshupu then won the second game with twenty-two to twenty.</p>
<p>Third Game: Nanmin had lost two games, so they embraced the ambition of breaking the cauldron and sinking the boat, and the momentum was turbulent. Although Yangshupu was an elite at the time, they sighed that heroes had no place to use their force. The two guards in the back row, Shen Erchang and Wang Dachun, provided support on the left and right, just right. The front row, Jin Adu and Liu Zhicong, had no worries, so they showed their skills, splitting and killing the ball, without missing a single one. Until after the switch of eleven to ten, Yangshupu desperately chased and took the lead with thirteen to eleven. Nanmin's attack was also fierce, and the scores went up and down, always close. Nanmin finally relied on the pressure of Jin, Liu, Feng, etc. to win back a game with twenty-two to twenty.</p>
<p>Fourth Game: After the start, Yangshupu scored first. Nanmin's Jin and Feng showed their magical powers, only to see them jumping up and down, tumbling and hitting, scoring three points. Yangshupu's Mai Bingyi struck with all his might, and Wei Dingyi's iron arm lifted up, accomplishing everything, taking the lead with five to three. After Nanmin won the switch from eleven to ten, Yangshupu concentrated its energy. Mai Wei killed with one block and one kill, and all returned with success. Nanmin's situation was greatly saddened by the decline of the river, and as a result, it was frustrated with a very close score of twenty-one to eighteen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, Zhu Kuan and Que Keling met in the Shanghai Open Handball Singles, exhausting the ability to be tense. After a fierce battle in three games, they were able to determine the winner. At first, Zhu Kuan continuously used fierce supply balls to oppress the opponent, once progressing to the extremely large distance of twelve to one. Then, Que also repaid with his housekeeping skills, but as a result, Zhu Kuan won the first game with twenty-one to twelve, which seemed not very difficult. The situation changed greatly in the second game. Zhu was very breathless and lost his basis for advancing and retreating. Que Keling went straight up, just like Zhu Kuan's expression in the first game, and there was no doubt about his victory. The score was twenty-one to eight. The third game was the key to victory or defeat. The two were fully focused, and the gain or loss of a ball was determined by many changes. Zhu Kuan was energetic and showed his excellent skills everywhere. Although Que was more fierce than ordinary people, he was still subject to Zhu Kuan's control and could not escape the example of failure. As a result, Zhu Kuan won the third game with twenty-one to thirteen. Zhu Kuan is still in control of this year's championship, and it seems that no second person will compete with him.</p>

<h3 id="e188">Finance: June Term Market - Margin Money Breaks 800 Yuan Mark - Overall Trend Seems to Shift with Exchange Rate Market - Initial Drop Followed by Rise, Resulting in a Relatively Stable Outcome - Gold Exchange to be Closed for Three Days Starting on the 19th <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>The gold market saw an initial drop followed by a rise yesterday. Factoring in swap transactions, the final outcome was level. The overall trend seemed to shift with the exchange rate market. With unsettled sentiments, the price once touched a low of 799 yuan. The exchange rate market tightened, resulting in a rebound of around 20 yuan. Early in the morning, overseas reports indicated that silver prices in both the UK and the US had slightly retreated, with a fall in forward silver prices in Montedeo. The exchange rate was slightly long, and the London gold price dropped by three and a half pence. People, mindful of the sharp price declines of the previous period, were generally cautious. As such, initial off-market transactions were only in the range of 18 to 19 yuan. Factoring in swap transactions, this was only slightly more stable compared to the previous closing. However, sellers continued to flock to the market, and lacking substantial support, the downward trend intensified, eventually falling back to 780 yuan. The Central Bank's published rates showed increases in both the UK and the US, with a decrease of 1.4% in the Customs Gold Unit. The standard price for margin money was lowered to 864.7 yuan. Seeing that the prices remained stable at low levels, the general sentiment was calm. Major players also showed an appetite for buying, and the price rose past the 10 yuan mark. After the opening, the exchange rate hardened due to the inability of Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu to find a counterparty for his dumping of shillings, leading to a severe decline. However, due to aggressive buying by major players taking advantage of the low prices, and slight increases in support from banks, the market rebounded, with a price increase of almost 10 yuan. Upon learning that the HSBC bank had posted its rates, with an increase of half a penny for the British pound and one yuan for the US dollar, the upward momentum was hindered and the price retreated within the 10 yuan range. Sassoon and China Merchants Bank aggressively dumped shillings, causing the domestic market to become unusually tight, exacerbating the selling pressure and leading to a collapse of long positions. Amidst occasional short covering, supply temporarily exceeded demand, breaking the 800 yuan mark. Major players took the opportunity to cover their positions at the low prices, and banks also stepped in to provide support. As the exchange rate market gradually tightened, prices gradually rose. Although not very impactful, news from the Associated Press that the Hong Kong government was considering banning silver exports did slightly improve sentiment, pushing the price above the 10 yuan mark. Sellers took advantage of the high prices to continue selling, and Guangdong traders re-emerged, eventually pushing the price back within the 10 yuan range. At noon, with an unsettled overall trend, the market bottomed out and then rebounded. Later in the market, with reports of small increases in Indian silver prices of 6, 7, and 10 annas, off-market prices immediately rose above the 10 yuan mark. After the opening, banks slightly sold on the high prices, and Guangdong traders continued to sell, causing the price to retreat within the 10 yuan range once again. The Daily Bank worked hard to provide support, but with a shortage of shillings, the exchange rate market tightened, and prices gradually rebounded. However, major short players aggressively added to their positions on the high prices, leading to many sell orders. Banks maintained a healthy appetite for buying, resulting in a surge of buyers. News agency reports quoting Song Ziwen's comments to reporters about silver only stated that various banks had cooperated and were determined not to allow physical silver to flow out, which had no impact on the gold market itself, but did improve sentiment. In addition, the second report of small increases in Indian silver prices made the market very attractive, but after the high prices, many traders exited their positions, resulting in further fluctuations. The market was erratic throughout the day, and swap transactions did indeed fall, lacking support from long positions. The swap rate, which had been a 2 yuan premium for the short side yesterday, retreated to a 10 cent premium. The daily market situation is recorded below.</p>
<p>The morning opening was at 810.5 yuan, a decrease of 2.8 yuan compared to the previous closing. Factoring in swap transactions, the decrease was even greater.

<p>The market situation remained largely unchanged yesterday, with the interbank loan rate remaining sluggish. The rate was still six points in the morning and afternoon. However, on the "one stroke of the head" side, due to a surplus of funds, there was a slight shortage, so there was an upward trend, opening at two points and then changing to a four-point market. The total turnover of interbank loan transactions was more than 3.2 million in the morning, with more than 300,000 in new transactions, and more than 400,000 in the afternoon. Transactions in the small general association totaled more than 500,000, and remittances from various routes totaled 400,000. Banknotes recovered totaled more than 800,000, and issued totaled more than 400,000. In addition, there were 500,000 in secretly marked coupons, with 200,000 from customer sources and 350,000 outflow. Bank recovery and settlement news was slightly more active than before. It is estimated that foreign banks recovered and settled more than 2.5 million in bill payments, 4.3 million in miscellaneous payments such as goods pledges, and 800,000 in special remittances.

<p>Jiangnan silver dollars, although the price rose by 1 yuan in the morning, opening at 837 yuan, the price returned to 826 yuan when the market closed in the afternoon due to weak transactions, so the result was the same as the previous day. The volume of transactions was 2,000 angles in the morning and 1,500 angles in the afternoon. The price of Guangdong silver dollars was 734.4 yuan in both the morning and afternoon markets, which was 8 angles smaller than the previous market. The volume of transactions was 155,000 angles in the morning and 45,000 angles in the afternoon. Copper coins were priced at 336,000 (text), which was 500 (text) smaller than the previous day. The transaction volume was 40,320 strings of text, equivalent to 12,000 yuan in foreign currency.</p>
<p>In addition, the total number of exchanges at the Municipal Clearing House was 10,140,485.74 yuan in silver dollars, including 5,450,061.01 yuan in silver dollars and 4,690,424.73 yuan in remittance silver dollars.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the market at the Chinese Securities Exchange trended downward. The floating long positions became gradually volatile. With the unusual surge in silver prices externally and the crowding of long positions internally, sentiment was slightly weak and selling pressure increased. The dull consolidation situation of the past few days showed some activity. The outcome of the stalemate between the two sides was still related to the money supply, with the floating long positions being the first to settle. Although there was a declaration that the three banks would release 20 million yuan in loans, the benefits to the bonds would likely be limited. The trend and future prospects are not easily improving temporarily. Selling pressure gradually increased throughout yesterday. The North gang sold the most of No. 35, followed by No. 61. In addition, No. 20, No. 21, and No. 43 also sold one after another. No. 16 consistently absorbed, and No. 14 and No. 18 also had an appetite for buying. Retail investors mostly sold more and bought less. The trend was that after the selling of the unified salt tax by No. 21 and others at the opening in the morning, the market immediately loosened. The market price was unable to stabilize in the second market and at the closing in the afternoon. Although the last prices showed some recovery, it was only due to short covering on the surface and should not be taken as optimistic. The final outcome was that the market price uniformly fell by about 12 cents to half a yuan. The total turnover was 12,830,000 yuan. A comparative list of the rise and fall results is shown on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>New Fung &amp; Co. reports: Yesterday (the 15th), the New York stock market was affected by railroad stocks, leading to fluctuations. The Supreme Court has adjourned, and no ruling has been made on the railroad pension case, causing railroad stocks to soften. Silver stocks also weakened due to profit-taking by bulls. However, market sentiment remains optimistic. U.S. government bonds strengthened due to lower interest rates but weakened again near closing. Foreign bonds were generally firm, and small exchange stocks showed an upward trend.</p>

<p>The yarn market is mediocre, and the overall trend is wavering again. However, general retail investors tend to short sell and are bearish due to the instability of the gold market and the extension of exchange rates. However, a certain major player's long position remains unchanged, with no intention of exiting the market. Therefore, although the atmosphere is not good, there is a lack of new sellers, mainly because the yarn inventory in Shanghai is decreasing day by day, allowing the market to maintain itself for a while.</p>
<p>Record of Shorting Current Month Yarn</p>
<p>The yarn forward market opened with each month showing a state of uncertainty. Transactions in the middle were sparse, with most holding a wait-and-see attitude. Overseas cotton markets continued to rise, while the gold market fell. The opening prices for each month were similar to the previous day. By the second or third bidding round, it was heard that margin calls caused a sudden surge in prices, and a slight bullish trend emerged. However, there was still a lack of new short selling, so the market could not fall significantly. As a result, the closing prices for each month were down 1.2 to 4 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was still sluggish, but by the second or third bidding round, it was heard that spot yarn transactions were doing well. The inventory statistics for the end of March were released, showing a decrease compared to the end of the previous month. At the same time, the gold price fell and then recovered. Tongji supplemented its short positions for this month with 100 bales per round, totaling 400 bales. Market sentiment slightly improved. As a result, each month rose 1.2 to 3.5 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 1,650 bales of Changfeng, 1,250 bales of Run Kang, 700 bales of Yongda, 450 bales of Jifeng, and 800 bales of Tonghe. Purchases included 350 bales of Taixing, 650 bales of Tongji, 350 bales of Junchang, 450 bales of Shenji, 700 bales of Renfeng, 350 bales of Xincheng, and 350 bales of Deji. The daily high and low prices and closing prices are listed below:</p>

<p>Coarse Yarn Prices Slightly Softer</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are still good. According to statistics, various merchant groups bought a total of 964 bales throughout the day. The price of 10-count yarn from the Shenxin Factory was slightly softer. Other prices were similar to the previous day. The purchase amounts for each merchant group are listed below:</p>
<p>Shantou 20, Changsha 50, Fellow traders 45, Inland 40, Ningbo 10, Guangdong 642, Haizhou 10, Fujian 2, Sichuan 100, Tianjin 10, Northern Group 25, Nanyang 10</p>

<p>The cotton market first fell and then rose, showing a significantly firm trend. Although Indian cotton rose by 3 rupees, exchange rates rose sharply, and the gold price once broke through the 800 yuan mark. However, the market was not significantly affected and rebounded in the afternoon. The main reason for this is that there is still no news of sufficient deliveries for this month.</p>
<p>Weak Deliveries This Month</p>
<p>The cotton forward market opened with a relatively stable market sentiment. American cotton rose slightly by 5 points, and Indian cotton rose by 1 to 3.5 rupees. The situation in the market was good. The opening prices for each month were unchanged. However, by the second or third bidding round, it was heard that the gold price broke through the 800 yuan barrier. Although the equalization tax remained unchanged, the exchange rates for Indian and American currencies were particularly long, and people suddenly became nervous. The market showed signs of panic. However, new short selling was not very active, except that Changfeng continued to sell. Therefore, the closing price rebounded slightly. As a result, each month only fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao compared to the previous day's closing price. The afternoon opening was relatively stable. By the second or third bidding round, a bullish trend suddenly emerged because the gold price rebounded, and deliveries for this month were still low. Short sellers therefore covered their positions, and the market turned upward. As a result, each month rose by 1.5 to 2.5 jiao compared to the morning closing price. Sales included 2,500 dan of Changfeng, 900 dan of Shengyuan, 1,700 dan of Yongda, 900 dan of Run Kang, 900 dan of Yifeng, and 600 dan of Changhe. Purchases included 1,700 dan of Dafu, 2,300 dan of Yuanyi, 2,300 dan of Taichang, 1,600 dan of Changfeng, 1,700 dan of Yikang, 900 dan of Yukang, 800 dan of Hexing, and 800 dan of Gengfeng.

<p>Yesterday's American cotton market, despite positive news from Liverpool and Bombay, market sentiment remained skeptical about the government's cotton policy. Buying was not as strong as last week. The opening was relatively stable, but it softened when old cotton was sold in large quantities. It continued to weaken in the afternoon due to selling by brokers. Near closing, it strengthened again due to buying by fellow traders and short covering. Spot prices rose by 5 points, and futures prices rose or fell by 2-3 points. English cotton spot prices rose by 4 points, and futures prices rose by 2 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to profit-taking by bulls but then rose due to strong spot demand and buying by bulls and speculators. Pingguoer rose by 0.5 to 1 rupee, Aomula rose by 2.75 rupees, and Bailuoxi rose by 2 to 32 rupees. The original telegram is on the left (dated the 15th).</p>

<p>The flour market was flat and stagnant yesterday. The quoted prices for foreign wheat were down 0.25 to 1 jiao for Chicago and 0.1 to 2 jiao for Canadian wheat. At the opening, due to the sharp increase in exchange rates, people inside and outside the industry were inevitably apprehensive. In addition, foreign wheat was slightly small, and the weather was still good. Prices for each month were down by 1 fen or less. However, after the second bidding round, the number of sellers decreased, and short covering increased slightly, and the market gradually improved. By the afternoon opening, it was still flat, but later, due to active short covering by customers and buyers, the market showed good signs. Although large factories were hedging, people's minds were still positive. Looking at the current situation, it is half due to the fluctuations in exchange rates and half due to the weather, which is also related. Overall, this month was better by 2.5 li, May was down by 2.5 li, June was down by 7.5 li, July was down by 5 li, August was unchanged, and September was down by 2.5 li.</p>
<p>The wheat market opened with favorable weather, and foreign wheat was slightly small. In the near term, due to the lack of chips, it never opened. For distant months such as July and August, the prices decreased by about 3 to 5 fen when traders from the interior slightly sold. By the afternoon opening, it was still flat, but later, due to the stabilization of the flour market and the cold and gloomy weather, people inside and outside the industry became slightly more stable. However, the transaction was not smooth and lacked vitality. As a result, July and August were up 1 fen compared to the previous day, and September was unchanged. The spot wheat market saw smooth transactions, and prices remained stable. Shandong Guide Nansuzhou wheat opened at 4 yuan, Bengbu wheat at 3 yuan 9 jiao 7 fen, and Xishi Liuhe wheat at 3 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen, totaling 4,500 bags, purchased by Fufeng.</p>

<p>Since soybeans from Shantou and Guangdong arrived, the market has turned dull. Currently, sales are only ——, and few oil factories are interested. Therefore, the overall trend depends on the role of soybean cakes. It is estimated that 3 cars of Yingzhou beans were opened at prices of 3 yuan 6 jiao and 5 jiao 5 fen, 1 car of Feihe beans at 3 yuan 5 jiao 3 fen, 400 bags of Guide beans at 3 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen, 160 bags of Hankou car beans at 3 yuan 8 jiao 2 fen, 100 bags of Hangou beans at 3 yuan 9 jiao 5 fen, 600 bags of Hanzha beans at prices from 3 yuan 8 jiao 5 fen to 6 jiao 5 fen, 260 bags of Hanchi beans at prices from 3 yuan 5 jiao 7 fen to 5 jiao, and 50 bags of Chongming sand yellow beans at 3 yuan 7 jiao 5 fen.</p>

<p>Yesterday, the sources from various merchant groups in the southern market suddenly increased again, with a total of 36 or 37 shipments (totaling over 7,000 shi). The market color was initially tight, but later, as more goods arrived, people became more discouraged. Sales in this street turned sluggish, and the situation became flat and soft. Except for the goods from the Su-Tong groups of thick japonica rice, the early rice from the Nan Gang group had an advantage with a flat price. It has now been reduced by nearly a foot. Fortunately, the late rice continued to be available, and more than a thousand bags were procured from Qingdao, Yantai, Weihaiwei, and Qinhuangdao, which were relatively firm. The market state was stable and also had a fresh color. Yinbian yuan goods were scarce, so they uniquely showed a beautiful color.</p>
<p>The northern market in Hexia had more than 30 shipments from various merchant groups. The early market for white japonica was still acceptable, causing prices to rise by several fen. The afternoon market turned sluggish, and prices stabilized. Except for the yuan ling goods that turned active, the prices turned firm. The rest were flat.</p>
<p>Yesterday's imported rice market, with prices rising continuously in the producing areas and strong sales in the interior, the market had a tendency to move upward step by step. However, yesterday the Japanese merchants were still greedy, and the interior had the greatest appetite. Nanjing and Beiyang both had news. This street was also active. The situation was excellent after the market opened in the morning. However, the gold price continued to decline, and the official gold price suddenly changed yesterday. The imported rice prices were lowered, and the market sentiment changed again. The afternoon market immediately turned flat, and the appetite was mostly wait-and-see. Speculative buying was also not persistent, and transactions decreased sharply. The two markets opened a total of about 11,000 bags of imported rice in the morning, and 3,000 bags of Ke Xian rice were slightly less, and the market was not significantly different.</p>

<p>Thinking about it, it's quite amusing to be alive. In the morning, you get up and put on clothes. After putting on clothes, you eat. After eating, you excrete. At night, you sleep. You perform the same old routine day after day until you die. Whether you are rich or poor, you can't escape this monotonous cycle.</p>
<p>Before entering society, I thought it would be interesting. But after entering society, I regretted coming here. It's like people who haven't married see others getting married and feel eager, wanting to find someone to marry immediately. But after actually getting married, they realize it's not a big deal. And then having children makes things even worse. When bored, they reminisce about the joys of being single and find it quite appealing. (No Payment Accepted)</p>
<h3 id="e200">Cheap <a href="#e200" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c200" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">200</a></h3>
<p>— Lán Shān</p>
<p>"Cheap" is a term used in buying and selling, meaning it's beneficial and harmless to one's own economic position. It's something that you and I both want to take advantage of.</p>
<p>Who doesn't like to buy cheap goods? Merchants, catering to this universal customer psychology, engage in cutthroat competition to put on their main act. Company A offers to give away four feet of silk for every foot purchased, attracting customers and wearing out their doorsteps. Company B, seeing this with envy, also launches a promotion offering seven feet for every foot purchased, sacrificing their profits to the extreme, trying to lure back lost customers from elsewhere with their invisible, alluring giant hand—cheapness. This is undoubtedly extremely cheap for the buyer, but have we ever seen the faces of those shareholders who are secretly worrying about "losing their capital"?</p>
<p>Also, when the maids and older sisters in the vegetable market buy entire baskets of green vegetables from the rural people for just a few copper coins, do they know that this is "rural bankruptcy"?</p>
<p>Some people praise others for buying an extremely cheap item, but do you know how many times it fails when they use it? And the short lifespan of the item? Thus, before the call for "cheapness" is finished, sighs of "being fooled" and curses follow.</p>
<p>From this, we can see that "cheapness" is one-sided and cannot be perfect for both sides. When one side is cheap, the other side always suffers a loss. This is a natural principle.</p>
<p>Taking advantage of cheapness is what everyone wants, but there must be a limit. You must not imitate that fool who, after marrying his wife for five months, started raising a baby, yet told everyone that it was cheap!</p>
<h3 id="e201">Mr. Shen <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Chén Jǐngyú</p>
<p>Mr. Shen is a friend who is completely foolish. Therefore, the things he does often have inconceivable ideas and novel tricks.</p>
<p>He was originally wealthy and often feared being targeted by bandits, so he racked his brains to come up with a "substituting a plum tree for a peach tree" method. He immediately bought a lot of thick paper and bound them into stacks of thirty to fifty sheets each, cutting them to the size of one-yuan, five-yuan, and ten-yuan banknotes from various banks. He then placed a real banknote on top and tied them up one by one with rope. The edges were then stained with dirty water to make them look like old banknotes. Then, he stored the stacks in a safe, preparing for emergencies. He boasted that it was an ingenious plan, even if Zhuge Liang were resurrected, he couldn't do better.</p>
<p>Opium was his only vice. He had to smoke a few puffs every day. However, he found it inconvenient to keep going to opium dens. So, he bought opium and asked someone to cook it for him, but he was troubled by the lack of ashes. Because cooking opium without ashes made the finished product not only of poor quality but also bland and tasteless. He pondered for a while, then turned around and went in. After a while, he happily came out carrying a piece of paper, exclaiming, "I have ashes!" In reality, this so-called ash was like a piece of burnt charcoal, made by roasting opium on the fire. When asked, "Why don't you just cook it all into opium paste? Why waste it?" He replied, "Then there would be no ashes!" The person was dumbfounded!</p>
<p>Recently, he suddenly thought of quitting opium, so he flipped through a copy of "Compendium of Materia Medica" and selected several medicines to soothe the stomach and intestines, which he boiled into a paste and drank with water. He thought that quitting opium was about promoting diarrhea. Once he had a bowel movement, the opium residue in his abdomen would definitely be removed completely, and his opium addiction would disappear without a trace! Unexpectedly, after taking the medicine, he had uncontrollable diarrhea like a burst Yellow River, almost unable to stand it. Fortunately, he still used opium to treat himself, and he managed to turn danger into safety. From then on, his addiction actually deepened!</p>

<p>Fine rain drizzling, hastening the growth of new green leaves on the tree tops. The fragrant grass is a stretch of emerald green, with no end in sight. The spring countryside scenery has taken on a new vigor.</p>
<p>On Qingming morning, a middle-aged couple held a bunch of fresh flowers, walking through the wheat fields, arriving at a grave, inserting the flowers at the head of the tomb, lingering and unwilling to leave quickly. After their sorrow, sighs were frequently heard. Suddenly, the wife looked into the distance, seeing an old woman holding paper money, pacing on the side of the road, appearing as if she was lost. Suddenly, she also took the road forward. Recognizing her after close examination, she urgently pulled at her husband's sleeve and said, "Let's leave. That woman is coming." In hesitation, the old woman arrived, with a pale face, seeming to nod her head, but not speaking. She sidled her body toward the front of the grave. At first she was only sobbing, and then she began to wail loudly. Her voice could be heard far and near, overwhelmingly mournful. The husband was also moved to tears. The wife revealed an impatient look and said: "Let's go, let's go. I shall go ahead." The husband did not heed her, and instead assisted the old woman to rise, saying: "Don't be so sad." The old woman cried even harder. After a while, her voice was hoarse and exhausted. Only then did she rise to burn the paper money. The remaining sorrow was not yet extinguished. At this time, the wife who had come first was already walking away in anger. The man could not bear to leave, repeatedly comforting the old woman, saying: "The deceased has passed, and you should cherish your own body. Do not be too sad for the sake of one who had a short life." The old woman with sorrow in her heart did not listen, wiping her red eyes, hunched over and walked, and walked and turned her head back, unable to bear to part. The man followed to send her off, only parting at the crossroads.</p>
<p>Ten years ago, that old woman was the man's wife, raising a son, extremely intelligent. When the child was fourteen years old, he graduated from junior high school. At that time, the husband had an affair, abandoning his family and eventually divorcing. The child went with his father, often taking the opportunity to visit his mother, and comforting her by saying: "Mother, do not be sad. When your son is able to stand on his own someday, he will welcome you to live with him." The wife supported herself with handicraft work. Several years passed, and the son got a job at a certain factory. Just when he was planning to save money to start a family, the January 28th Incident suddenly broke out. Enraged by the enemy's unreasonableness, he joined the volunteer army to participate in the war, and unfortunately died from a bullet wound. After the war, the father chose to bury him here. At first, the mother did not know of this. Later, hearing of the loss, she cried aloud, her business immediately ended. She regretted not knowing where the body was buried, searching and inquiring in all directions, but no one knew the answer. In recent years, her sorrow and depression has grown, and she has become increasingly haggard. Only then did she learn that his bones were buried in the eastern suburbs, and she came to seek the trace and cry at his grave on Qingming Day. She was even able to meet her former love rival, encountering layers of sadness, which was all the more pitiable.</p>

<p>— Zhu Yun</p>
<p>Teeth are the primary weapons for chewing food; whether food is thoroughly chewed is closely related to digestion. The soundness of teeth is linked to one's overall health, so oral hygiene and protecting teeth are important.</p>
<p>However, the condition of my teeth is quite tragic; most of them have problems. Some are decayed, others are broken. Though patched up here and there, these dentures are ultimately not as useful as my own teeth. They are either uncomfortable or lack strength. I can't chew hard things, and even when eating tender bamboo shoots, I must be especially careful. Otherwise, if the false teeth are jostled, a wave of sourness and numbness shoots straight to my heart, and the pain almost brings tears to my eyes.</p>
<p>I love to eat peanuts, but I can only watch others enjoy them, while I can only swallow my saliva, unable to enjoy the pleasure. Sometimes I buy some fruit pastries, but the crispy and delicious taste of peanuts is nowhere to be found. A person in their thirties already has blurred vision, graying hair, and missing teeth, truly becoming an old man in his youth. Thinking about it, I find it both laughable and regrettable!</p>
<p>The main reason for my tooth loss is that I loved eating sweets since I was a child, and my parents were not attentive to my dental hygiene. It wasn't until I was eleven or twelve, when I switched from private tutoring to elementary school, that I started brushing my teeth and rinsing my mouth. However, my teeth were already disorganized, blackened, and not very healthy. Sometimes when my teeth ached, the pain was so severe that I couldn't eat and my face was swollen, preventing me from sleeping well for days. So by the time I turned twenty, four or five teeth on both sides had already decayed, leaving many holes between the upper and lower rows of teeth.</p>
<p>Because a friend worked as an assistant at a dentist's office, he saw my decayed teeth and encouraged me to get gold teeth, offering a special price. Persuaded by him, I went to the dentist's office to get them fitted. Since two canine teeth on the left side were missing, I first got three teeth fitted: one was a shell attached to the adjacent tooth, one was a gold tooth, and one was a porcelain tooth. To fit them, the dentist first took a mold of my teeth with a red powder, then proceeded with the fitting. During the process, the dentist used a lathe to grind and grind my teeth, the vibrations sending waves of sourness and numbness, and the smell of burning filled my throat, making it very unpleasant.</p>
<p>After the teeth were fitted, my friend presented the bill, which amounted to sixteen dollars. This amount shocked me. After much negotiation, I angrily demanded that he remove the fitted teeth, and I paid a few dollars to settle the matter. However, a friend ended our friendship over this.</p>
<p>After this lesson, I dared not get gold teeth again, allowing my teeth to decay. However, at the end of last year, while chewing an olive, I bit down hard and broke half of my front tooth. Opening my mouth, it was unsightly with gaps everywhere, so I had to get it fixed again. So, my wife and I went to several small dental shops in Niujiaobing, and after much discussion, we had five gold teeth and one porcelain tooth fitted at the Tianji Dental Shop for a total of eight silver dollars. The price was indeed cheap, but they were not very comfortable. Opening my mouth, the gaps were no longer visible, but these forcibly fitted teeth were ultimately not practical. I deeply felt that protecting teeth is a crucial matter in life, especially one should pay attention to it in childhood!</p>

<p>The room he lived in could be considered first-class here. Yet, he left without worrying about people dirtying his bedding or stealing his belongings. So, he said to Yueying, "If you went to the front like this, I'm afraid Master Jia wouldn't let you sleep on his bed. It's rare to have this gentleman's kindness, so you should take off your wet clothes. I'll talk to Master Jia for you." Thus, Yang Huanhua went to the front to reply to Jia Duocai. Hu's wife took Yueying to Zhizhi's room. The tea server and Hu's wife were acquaintances, and Zhizhi had instructed them in person, so they decided to be kind and let them go into the room without interfering. Yueying walked into the room soaking wet. Whether she felt cold or not was not important; she only felt her upper and lower teeth chattering, fighting each other. Hu's wife felt a bit sorry for her trembling body, so she helped her unbutton her clothes and lowered Zhizhi's curtain. Yueying went inside the curtain and took off all her clothes, shoes, and socks. She unfolded the quilt and burrowed inside. Naturally, she wrapped herself tightly, but her body had been iced by rainwater for so long that she couldn't stop shivering. Hu's wife rolled up her clothes, shoes, and socks into a large bundle and said to her, "Rest comfortably in bed. I'll take these things to dry. I'll hook the door from the outside so no one will come in." (184)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Although they were not all doing embroidery work at the same time, some might have been drafting designs, while others were matching threads. However, once a flower on a piece of satin was assigned to someone for embroidery, that person would eventually be responsible for completing it. Moreover, each piece of satin was not just for one pair of shoe uppers but often for five or six pairs together. Therefore, the top, bottom, left, and right sides of the satin were almost covered with patterns to be embroidered. Each female worker lowered her head—they had to lower their heads very low, almost pressing their eyes against the satin. Because this work was extremely delicate, they had to see clearly to avoid mistakes—and silently embroidered.</p>
<p>Now, let me explain their work process in more detail: First, they used white powder to outline several shoe upper shapes on the satin according to the drawn shoe patterns. They had to leave some space between each pair for cutting. Once the outlines were drawn, they started embroidering each shoe upper one by one. However, before embroidering each shoe upper, there was some preparatory work. For example, if a plum blossom was needed on a shoe upper, they would first cut out several differently shaped plum blossoms from thin white paper. Then, they would place these paper flowers on the drawn shoe upper on the satin, trying them here and there, using an artistic eye to determine their appropriate positions. Once the positions were determined, they would use silk thread to tack them down. The silk thread used at this time was usually white, and they didn't need to use many stitches, just enough to hold the paper flowers in place. (294)</p>

<h3 id="e207">Teacher with Entourage <a href="#e207" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c207" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">207</a></h3>
<p>— Gang</p>
<p>Brothels have managers with entourages, and now schools have teachers with entourages. Truly, the tricks are new and getting stranger.</p>
<p>It is said that brothel managers with entourages bring one or two young ladies. The money earned by these young ladies is split between the brothel and the manager. So, these managers are very comfortable. In the afternoon or evening, they listen to storytelling in a few big theaters or play mahjong with some regular customers. Therefore, the lives of these managers are quite comfortable.</p>
<p>Who knew that in Shanghai, now known as the "New York of the East," there was also a teacher with an entourage in the education sector? According to yesterday's newspaper, Huang Kangsheng from Haimen used to teach in Yongkang, Zhejiang. This spring, through an introduction, he became a geography and history teacher at the Minhua Vocational Middle School on Yanping Road in Shanghai. At that time, he agreed with Principal Cai of the school that Huang could bring more than fifty students from Yongkang, and his salary would be higher than other teachers. Therefore, Cai agreed to pay Huang a monthly salary of fifty yuan, which was twenty yuan higher than other teachers.</p>
<p>Now, let me calculate this account for the principal. This business is indeed profitable. It is said that the school charges each student sixty yuan per semester for tuition, board, and miscellaneous fees. If calculated with fifty students, the school would receive three thousand yuan per semester, amounting to six thousand yuan per year. Even if the teacher is paid twenty yuan more per month, the annual cost (calculated for twelve months) would only be two hundred and forty yuan. The profit would be five thousand seven hundred and sixty yuan. Even after deducting student board and other expenses, estimated at three thousand yuan, the net profit would be more than two thousand seven hundred yuan. This business is indeed profitable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, on one hand, the teacher's ability was weak, and the number of fifty students was greatly reduced. On the other hand, he had bad intentions and embezzled three hundred and fifteen yuan of tuition fees. With these two significant reductions, the principal's profit was minimal, and he naturally became furious and wanted to file a lawsuit to recover the embezzled money. This kind of scandalous history in Shanghai's education sector is truly unheard of.</p>
<p>However, there are many "school shops" opened in Shanghai. Some collect tuition fees but do not start classes, some only have subjects but no teachers, and some conduct trial teaching for a year before hiring. There are all kinds of tricks, so many that they cannot be written down. Then, how could a teacher with an entourage not be a money-making avenue for the school shop owner? Suppose each school had ten such teachers as Huang; at the end of the year, the results would be joyously revealed.</p>
<h3 id="e208">Flower Shop Vignette <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>These past few evenings, when walking past the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Seymour Road and turning towards my residence, I have often been drawn to the vibrant and moving flower shop. Smoking a peaceful cigarette, I stood on the asphalt pavement planted with plane trees. Unexpected bursts of floral fragrance blew into my nose with the evening breeze. Turning back from the bustling road with countless lights, what caught my eye was the bright window with its thousands of reds and purples. The mottled colors were like an ancient brocade. The alluring peach blossoms, like enchanting dancers, the pale white flowers with the demeanor of philosophers, the lilacs gazing as forlornly as aggrieved women, the slender and pure redbuds, the carnations suitable for wedding banquets or hanging by purple silk curtains, and many other strange and wonderful flowers and herbs, all piled before your eyes, competing for attention. The scene truly made you forget that you were in a noisy city and instead placed you in a dazzling flower garden in April. If the window also reflected bright snow and added a few people with less of a commercial air, it would truly brew a strange and lingering mood for you.</p>
<p>Standing there, quietly invaded by the floral fragrance, the various elegant colors before my eyes, pale scarlet, deep purple or light purple, emerald green as fresh and moist as jadeite paired with a few delicate white dots, small blood bead-like crimson points embellishing the plain background, and yellow symbolizing noble hope, only without black and gray, such colors have no place in the realm of the blue sky. These flower branches have not been heavily trimmed, and the wild and natural charm is like that of a country girl by a bridge and flowing stream, not as hot and scorching as the women in the city, making you feel agitated, nor as coldly freezing as the old-fashioned ladies in their boudoirs, like a glass of green wine, giving you a peaceful joy as you sip and savor it. Although there is no blue wave and swallow feathers there, facing these flowers, you already know that this is spring.</p>
<p>Moreover, this is precisely the season of drizzling rain. Because of the rain, everything is plated with a layer of sorrowful color. The sound of cars, the voices of people, the sound of selling evening newspapers, although loud, are purely powerless at this time. The street in the evening mist, the red and green traffic lights and advertisements in the rain threads, and these flowers, when brought together, are all worth obsessing over. Inside the flower shop, it is always sunny, and it is a dreamlike sunny day in April, rich and fragrant, like a long love song. Here, there is no war, no blood, no pursuit of wealth, no sighs and tears; everything is buried in a gentle hope.</p>
<p>Standing outside and looking already gives one more than sensory satisfaction. If you push open the door and enter, the situation is different again. A person seems to be born into a fragrant country. The fragrant and warm air envelops your whole body, and rainbow-like colors surround you. It is as gentle as a wedding night, with an enchanting expression in front, and greasy brocade curtains and</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>Elegant tassels on the side, you can't help but be intoxicated. I remember one flower shop kept a small canary. The elegant music like reed pipes directly passed through the glass window and dissipated from the green shade of the trees, harmonizing with the strange fragrance and the gorgeous colors, like a sweet dream that makes people feel lost.</p>
<p>When returning, I often buy a bunch or two of flowers. These flowers accompany my slender and lonely shadow as I cross the main road, walk towards the quiet residential area, and enter my residence. I put this bunch of flowers in a vase and place it next to those ancient and solemn philosophical books, just like a young maiden leaning on a kind old grandfather. When the lights are turned off, there is the fragrance of books and the fragrance of flowers in the silence. Now the flowers have begun to wither. When I am writing, I see one or two withered purple shadows, seemingly infinitely regretting their past glorious years!</p>
<h3 id="e209">On the Market Boat <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Tianqi</p>
<p>—Random Notes on Returning South—</p>
<p>When the east began to turn slightly white, the boatman shouted loudly, and the heavily loaded market boat shook a little and slowly drifted towards the center of the river. The river surface was covered with soft morning mist; the light green river water gently lapped against the bow in the stillness. On the south bank, under the mountains, the long calls of women summoning the ferry had already risen. Looking back, the shadows of the riverside shops in Song City gradually blurred into the smoke and mist.</p>
<p>Inside the empty boat canopy, there was only me, a passenger, which invisibly thickened the lonely feeling in my heart. As far as I know, ordinary market boats usually had at least twenty or thirty passengers, crowded like a beehive. Now, this unusual situation could not help but surprise me, and it quickly turned into terror. A terrifying image of boatmen plotting to kill for money, which I had seen in novels, stuck to my heart, and I regretted not taking the market boat so rashly.</p>
<p>There were five boatmen on board, four pushing poles at the bow, and an old man in his fifties steering the rudder. His coarse, dark skin clearly marked the decades of wind and frost he had endured. A sorrowful and helpless expression would occasionally float across his thick, dark eyebrows, invisibly intensifying his age. However, the eyes embedded under his thick eyebrows still radiated a strong and kind light, which showed that he was not discouraged by his career and that he was a good person.</p>
<p>My seat was in the aft cabin canopy, directly facing the old man. It was easy for us to start a conversation. After some conversation, my previous doubts completely disappeared, because he had told me that he was the owner of the boat and that we were also paternal uncle and nephew from Baima Village.</p>
<p>Because of our clan relationship, our conversation became much more cordial. At this time, the boat had just reached a turning dike, and the current became rapid. While he focused all his attention on the water conditions ahead, holding the rudder tightly with both hands, he panted and told me intermittently about the situation in the countryside, how difficult it was getting day by day, and how the opening of the Song County Highway had dealt a fatal blow to all the market boats.</p>
<p>—"The market customers, do they, who do small business also, afford to pay twice as much as the boat fare for the bus?"</p>
<p>—"Old nephew, you just came back, so you don't know. At first, we only lost a group of passing customers, but soon the heartless bus company said something about preferential treatment for market customers. All market customers only have to pay one-third of the bus fare. In this way, who wouldn't be happy to take the bus!"</p>
<p>—"Old nephew, let me say something stupid, but I think the world is only going to force us poor people to death! Is that right? Hahahaha!"</p>
<p>His laughter was clearly a helpless and pointless self-comfort. Just as the fate before him had cruelly shattered all his efforts, but for the sake of hunger, for the sake of the continuation and expansion of life, he still had to seek survival in despair, enduring wind and rain, and could not be discouraged and sit still and die. However, although he wanted to use laughter to cover up the pain in his heart, it was even more difficult for me to watch than to see him cry.</p>
<p>I did not say a word, only watched in a daze as the mountains, embankments, and forests moved slowly backwards... At this time, the sun was hanging high on the mountain peak, and the boatmen at the bow were also straining their muscles, making the tenacious cry of hauling the sea, against the current, pushing the boat towards the dangerous and difficult-to-cross Shimen shoal not far ahead...</p>
<h3 id="e210">Ba Store <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Jingyun</p>
<p>The rooster was crowing in the chicken coop behind the attap house. The sun, like a brazier, drilled out from the misty coconut groves covered with a layer of light gauze. The voices of people and animals in Bali were gradually becoming noisy and lively. At this time, Huang Shunzhi and his brother climbed out of bed. As usual, they didn't take a "cold" or "rinse," and hurriedly packed their simple luggage, ate a hasty breakfast, and bid farewell to their "boss," who was also their close clan uncle, Heqing. They left the store and took the early bus to Wanggu.</p>
<p>Uncle Heqing saw the two brothers out of the store, tightly holding their rough arms, spitting out sincere words like chunks of鲜red blood from the bottom of his heart:</p>
<p>"Shunzhi, nephew, it's not that your uncle doesn't want you two brothers to stay in the store, it's just that the store's business has become so bleak lately! If things continue like this, the future is extremely pessimistic. Maybe in another two or three months, your uncle's store will be unable to maintain itself and will close down. ... You are all young lads who can endure hardship. Staying here is not a perfect solution. You should work hard outside to have hope! ..." Uncle Heqing's heavy voice trembled, and his eyes were moist.</p>
<p>The Shunzhi brothers lowered their heads and responded vaguely, then walked away.</p>
<p>It wasn't until the shadows of the two brothers disappeared in the middle of the street that Uncle Heqing slowly walked back into his grocery store.</p>
<p>"If it were a few years ago, it wouldn't matter if a few more people came to live and eat in the store. At that time, the business was so prosperous! The store employed more than a dozen clerks, and it was still busy all day long, sweating all over, without a moment to spare. Who could have predicted that now, the business would become so desolate and bleak that even the problem of eating would become alarming!" Uncle Yiheqing sighed secretly in his heart. The more he thought about it, the more uneasy he felt. He felt as tired as after excessive labor. He moved his buttocks to the short stool near the counter, casually took out his pipe from the counter, filled it with tobacco, closed his eyes, and puffed away.</p>
<p>Uncle Heqing was an honest and loyal old man, about fifty years old. Since coming to Fanbang, he had been running this "Yuanji" grocery store in Shangba, specializing in business with the natives. At the same time, he also bought the natives' grain and transported it in large quantities to Wanggu to sell to the rice mills that husked rice. Then, he used the money he earned to purchase a large quantity of daily necessities in Wanggu and transport them to Shangba to sell to the natives.</p>
<p>Now the natives are not as foolish as before. They know how to do business, and the government has also opened a sales bureau in Shangba to buy the natives' grain at a fixed price and severely punish the natives for selling the grain to grain merchants at low prices. As a result, Uncle Heqing's business has been completely robbed.</p>
<p>Recently, the government has also sent officials to the streets to investigate the business operations and capital of various shops, saying that they will soon implement the collection of "business tax."</p>
<p>"In this year, business is really not easy to do! Last year, they collected some 'income tax,' and now they are coming with a 'business tax.' The market situation is getting colder and colder day by day, but the taxes are pressing people down so that they can't lift their heads!" Uncle Heqing knocked his pipe on the ground with a clatter, and muttered unhappily in his heart.</p>
<p>"Perhaps after Shunzhi and his brothers arrive in Wanggu, their friends will ridicule him behind his back, saying that he can't even keep his nephews, unbearable words to hear. However, who doesn't feel the difficulty of the commercial situation in this year, let alone my shop, which is already a bit precarious! ..."</p>
<p>When Uncle Heqing opened his eyes, which were sunken like two holes, and saw the sparse goods in the store and the silence like after noon, with not a single customer walking in, his dream of "crossing the ocean to Fanbang" and "picking up gold," which he had cherished in his heart for more than twenty years, was shattered into pieces.</p>
<h3 id="e211">Laborious Fate <a href="#e211" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c211" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">211</a></h3>
<p>— Ke Ming</p>
<p>When I arrived at Baojiakou, I unexpectedly saw that old bald mule driver again, with his head completely shaved. Everything was the same: the city wall, the river, the foot-pricking gravel on the ground. The only differences were that the old bald man's wrinkled face was even more wrinkled, withered, and shrunken than before, and those sturdy legs, which he used to boast could walk fifty li a day on the sandy roads, had also lost their vigorous posture of yesteryear. Also, that black mule with its ears perked up (we remember it was only five years old), overly exhausted but underfed, was also drooping its head, dragging its four crippled legs with a lack of energy, and burying its dull brain, incapable of contemplation, in past memories.</p>
<p>(But everything is still the same! The mountains, the trees, the setting sun hanging over the city walls at dusk!)</p>
<p>As I approached, the old bald man finally lifted his head from his empty musings. He saw me at a glance, and in his astonishment, a hint of a smile flashed like lightning across the countless wrinkles on his old face. The smile crept up the old bald man's face, which had been worn down by more than sixty years of hard living, like a ray of sunlight shining on a desolate island covered in perennial ice and snow. Though weak, perhaps it could melt a small piece of ice shavings, bearing boundless bitter cold?</p>
<p>"Ah ha! Fine gentleman, honored gentleman, you are so well, so content, aren't you? Ha, you certainly look much more prosperous!" His voice was hoarse and dry. He tried to make it sound more natural, younger, and more robust, but that was not an easy task.</p>
<p>We all had a strange feeling. Looking at the old bald man, looking at the mule, they had completely lost their former vitality. The violence of life was pushing people towards the fragile icy river of death, and now both man and beast had been pushed to the edge of the line of death.</p>
<p>"Old bald man, you've gotten old too."</p>
<p>"Ah, my gentleman: old? Yes, getting old is fine, but a laborious fate means suffering even if one doesn't get old, just like livestock. Getting old is... fine... But it's this animal that suffers!"</p>
<p>That's right, I remembered: the old bald man hadn't changed. He still treated that black mule like a friend.</p>
<p>Some time ago, we stayed in a small village near Baojiakou for a summer. We had brought some inexpensive summer medicinal materials here to trade. After settling into the inn, because the roads there were all sand, and the blazing sun made them as hot as red-hot iron, walking was not easy. So, we decided to ask the innkeeper to find a reliable mule driver and hire his mule for a month. The innkeeper called the old bald man. He said: The man is quite sturdy and reliable, the animal is strong, and the man has no family, so he can travel with guests all over the country.</p>
<p>That's how we started dealing with the old bald man.</p>
<p>Although the old bald man's sparse, almost bare temples were already gray, he was not as withered as he was now, and he walked briskly. What was particularly strange was that he had a special kindness towards his only mule. Not only would he never hit it himself, but if a guest mistreated it, the old bald man would say in a trembling voice: "Gentleman, have mercy, the livestock also have a laborious fate..."</p>
<p>"Old bald man, you are quite good."</p>
<p>"Ah, dear sir, you don't know, three years of war, my mother died, my father died, my old home is gone, my own son wandered away, and only this animal, suffering as I do, is left. People are like livestock, they also have a laborious fate..."</p>
<p>The three words "laborious fate" resonated with sorrowful thoughts. It seemed to hint at a person's terrible destiny, carrying a similarly vibrant life. People walk in the world, passing through mountains and seas, but some people are destined to fall into a bottomless pit of brown toil forever.</p>
<p>And now, it should be the turn of other people and animals to wander on the perpetually toiling brown line of death.</p>

<p>— Hu Sizhong</p>
<p>We have already reached the opposite bank of the bridge: our bodies are now situated in the Malay Federation. A customs gate flashed before our eyes. The Malay police gave us a quick glance and then let us pass. As soon as we stepped onto the soil of Johor, the Johor royal palace appeared amidst the mountains. A crescent moon flag was raised above the palace, and a circle of bamboo fence surrounded the magnificent building. Johor's city then revealed smooth asphalt roads, a bustling cityscape, and the clamor of shops. Electric lights flickered, cars crowded, and the urban landscape unfolded before us.</p>
<p>A large group went to a restaurant to eat, as the spirit of tropical people at night is both clear and cheerful. Everyone often laughed.</p>
<p>After dinner, Li immediately suggested going to the Johor beach to enjoy the cool air and see the night view. So we drove the car to the beach near the iron bridge. Everyone chose chairs set up on the beach for tourists to sit down. We saw the moon hanging obliquely in the sky. A hazy moonlight shone on the sea, revealing the sea's vast and bright embrace, which was more flavorful compared to its roughness during the day. The iron bridge looked even longer at night, and the dark shadows of the forests on the opposite bank appeared even more blurred. Only a crystal-like gray-white color covered the distant area. Under the moonlight, the strings of cars and rows of electric lights appeared even more beautiful than in the evening. The sea breeze opened our hearts, and some people even lay down on the chairs.</p>
<p>"What a beautiful day, no wonder the King of Johor wants to become a romantic emperor!" Ming said.</p>
<p>"I wish I could die in the waters of the Johor Strait!" Li and Ruo said.</p>
<p>Everyone then stood up, preparing to push him into the sea.</p>
<p>After an hour or two, seeing that everyone's hearts were filled with the beautiful scenery, and the tourists on the shore were gradually thinning out, and the sound of the sea gradually rose from the low city noise, we had no choice but to leave.</p>
<p>The car sped across the iron bridge, and our bodies and minds were unusually comfortable and joyful. We climbed past the desolate outskirts of Lion Island again, and then entered the heart of the city from the edge. The pollution and noise of Singapore touched us again.</p>
<p>"Oh, how annoying Singapore is!" everyone sighed, seemingly feeling a great regret for abandoning the iron bridge and beach of Johor. (The End)</p>

<p>Opening: "Shanghai Night"</p>
<p>The spring gloom is dimming near dusk. Thousands of homes are lighting up. The prosperity of Shanghai is unmatched. Neon lights illuminate the six streets. One can see the brightly lit rooftops of the Three Companies like paintings. The noise from the amusement park is heard from the upper levels. The theaters open their doors with gongs, and people flock in like swarms. Those booking boxes arrive close to midnight. Several restaurants serving Beijing and Jiangsu cuisine begin banquets early. When the mood strikes, they invite courtesans to accompany the guests. The lights of the brothels compete in extravagance, with red and blue lights distinguishing them clearly. Many lavish spenders hold court. The sound of catching sparrows creates a hubbub in the bamboo forest. After the party, everyone eats porridge. Barbers escort guests, sharing intimate moments. Several hotels thrive, relying on warm heaters and water heaters. Even more, the Jai Alai stadium's business is good. Sons of wealthy families go to play. Even more, people compete to watch the greyhound racing at Yiyuan. Electric lights flash as the dogs run swiftly behind. Ballroom dancing is popular in Shanghai. Couples dance gracefully, enjoying the music. Champagne is opened for kisses. Young people are captivated. Secret whispers are exchanged; desires burn. Everyone knows that a moment of spring night is worth a thousand gold pieces. They return by car, as dawn breaks.</p>

<p>When an actress publicly states that she doesn't want to be a star, she must already have star status. Otherwise, those words are meaningless. Marjorie Evans, one of the cast members of "Little Lord Fauntleroy," playing David Copperfield's second wife, Agnes, is the person who said these words, "I don't want to be a star." She is not just using wishful thinking to comfort herself, nor is she boasting or exaggerating. She has very good reasons and insights.</p>
<p>She says, "People will hear my words and say, 'Here we go again, another self-promotion,' but for me, it's a very natural and reasonable feeling. I have to explain my reasons in detail. I think Hollywood has all kinds of people, making it a good place to compare values and learn. When I ask myself whether I want my name, adorned with dazzling lights, to be displayed across the sky, larger than everyone else's name, I take a look around.</p>
<p>"For example, there used to be an 'It' Girl here. She was a star. From the moment she got out of bed in the morning, 'It' ruled her entire life until she went to bed. The public demanded 'It,' they paid money to see 'It,' and they had to get 'It.' I feel that 'It' is simply an inhuman life. That kind of stressful life! That 'It' Girl had to prove that she truly had 'It' not only to her audience but also to her friends, servants, journalists, company executives, directors, extras, and even the baker.</p>
<p>"Then look at Greta Garbo. I admire her very much and acknowledge her as a great artist. But if someone asked me to fight for her star status, I would feel it's not worth it. I think she must be very tired of those black glasses. I think she must often resent being a star because she has lost her freedom by becoming a star. She has to put on makeup wherever she goes and avoid people's eyes and ears, fearing that someone will recognize her.</p>
<p>"And once an actress becomes a star, her lifestyle, diet, social life, etc., must be arranged according to her star status and prestige. Even Norma Shearer, Joan Crawford, Constance Bennett, and Marlene Dietrich—who are very real women—must concentrate their energy and constantly consider their status and honor. This way, they will never have free time to relax. They must live in magnificent mansions. They must dress beautifully and fashionably. They must hire many servants. Their cars must be brand new and luxurious. They must also acquire jewelry, expensive fur coats, pedigree dogs, and have a garden, swimming pool, tennis court, and all other kinds of luxury items in their home. They are stars, and these things are what the public expects from stars.</p>
<p>"The four actresses mentioned above have all achieved considerable status and prestige, and it seems that they don't need to abide by that unwritten law of the film city, but they can't do it. Stars still have to compete with each other. Everything they eat, live, wear, and socialize with must be extravagant to prove and maintain their reputation. This situation is better now than before, but habits are hard to change. They still have to compare who has the most magnificent house, who has the most elegant garden, who has the most valuable car or yacht, and who has the most diamonds. This is another reason why I don't like being a star.</p>
<p>"If I were just a top-notch actress, not a star, I could live a simpler life. I now live with my mother and brothers in a rented house, and my life is not much different from that of an ordinary American woman. I work very hard every day, but when I'm not working, I can move freely, read books, swim, visit girlfriends, and go out and have fun. I don't have to worry about people peeking at me or bothering me, and I don't attract the attention of curious people.</p>
<p>"I rarely attend banquets, so I don't need many evening gowns. I haven't thought about buying a yacht. If I had one, I wouldn't know how to use it. I also don't want to customize a special car because an ordinary car is enough for my needs. I don't have to socialize with directors, flatter producers, or contact movie stars, so I don't need a garden house, swimming pool, tennis court, or many servants. But if I were a star, it wouldn't be that simple.</p>
<p>These are all the reasons why I don't want to be a star, but there are more reasons than just the ones mentioned above. (To be continued)</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e217">Review of "Under Pressure" <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Under Pressure — Grand Theater</p>
<p>Not long ago, I saw the trailer for "Under Pressure" at the Grand Theater. The tense scenes and excellent cinematography made me eagerly await the opening of this film. But now I am disappointed. My previous hopes have been replaced by endless emptiness. "Under Pressure" is not a successful work.</p>
<p>Technically speaking, I have to admit that the cinematography is still worth watching. The stark contrast of black and white contributes to the rugged atmosphere. However, the director repeatedly wasted film on road construction, always building roads and always creating contrived tension. This gives people a sluggish and monotonous feeling. I don't know if the director has much experience with underwater road construction, but I always feel that it's very different from the real situation. At the very least, he failed to use pure film techniques to convey a sense of reality. Fortunately, the worker Chuck's personality is likeable. We are very familiar with McLaglen's acting style.</p>
<p>The success or failure of a film cannot be judged solely by the director's or actors' skills. The script often ruins the director. Indeed, the failure of "Under Pressure" is precisely due to the writer's vulgar understanding of social reality and technically incompetent performance.</p>
<p>If this film has a theme at all, it is to value money as an honor, causing workers to desperately build roads and risk their lives to earn large sums of money. Can we say that this is a proper encouragement of the spirit? On the contrary, it is merely a material temptation. On the other hand, we see workers fighting over money, causing division among them. Thus, this is precisely a consistent manifestation of the American film's spirit of serving the current system.</p>
<h3 id="e218">Why Does Cecil B. DeMille Wear Riding Attire? <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Dong Lin</p>
<p>Several years ago, when the film industry was still in the silent era, Hollywood directors used to wear short shirts and riding breeches, with long boots, to the studio to work. So at that time, riding attire became like the director's uniform, just as photographers were distinguished by wearing their bird-hunting hats backwards. But with the passage of time, this custom gradually disappeared, and now it can be said that directors all wear ordinary suits to the studio.</p>
<p>However, there is still one person who maintains the "old days" look, and that is the great director Cecil B. DeMille!</p>
<p>DeMille has a dozen pairs of long boots. He never wears the same pair of boots to the studio for two consecutive days. And each pair of his long boots has different short shirts and riding breeches to match. He likes to wear khaki riding breeches and a green short shirt.</p>
<p>In 365 days a year, you can never see DeMille wearing a 1935-style suit in the studio! No! Regardless of whether other directors have changed their clothes, Cecil B. DeMille still wears the old riding attire, with the clatter of thick leather long boots, walking into the studio!</p>
<p>Many people wonder: Why does DeMille wear riding attire? The eccentric old director answered him this way: "There are two reasons: first, because I am a director. As for the second reason, it's because ordinary clothes can never withstand the intense work of being a director. And I feel very comfortable wearing this riding attire. No matter how rough you are, you don't have to worry about it breaking. So I change it every day, just because I want to feel refreshed!"</p>
<p>"So you don't wear it to give the actors a psychological reaction?" the reporter asked him again.</p>
<p>"No, no!" DeMille replied with a smile: "I believe that the actors I direct are controlled by my little bit of brains, not by this pair of long boots!"</p>

<p>— Wei Bai</p>
<p>Dong Tianya has been extremely busy these past few days preparing the grand sets for "The Soul of the Nation" and "The Big Family." From drafting to construction to filming, he is always personally planning and directing on the side. He is considered one of the most responsible and loyal members of the film industry.</p>
<p>The Mingxing Bi-Weekly, I heard, has already been published and should be on sale in the next day or two. The content is written by famous figures and writers in the film industry, and it is expected to sell well.</p>
<p>Gao Qianping has been wearing completely black clothing from head to toe these past few days, truly resembling her nickname, "Magpie."</p>
<p>Shu Xiuwen is playing the role of Qiu Jin in "The Soul of the Nation." Her Japanese-style hairstyle in the makeup is quite complicated, and each time it costs one yuan and forty cents for the hairstyling fee, which is also a new record in film.</p>
<p>"The Season of Falling Flowers," secretly screened at the Central Theater the day before yesterday, has many poetic performances and scenes, which is another new advancement in Chinese cinema.</p>
<p>There is a brand new female talent named Li Qiuyin. Her face and figure are very full and beautiful. (Incomplete)</p>
<h3 id="e220">Diao Banhua is Willing to Be Beaten <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>Diao Banhua, a brilliant new star of Lianhua, has left a very good impression on the Chinese people since her debut in "New Woman." Film enthusiasts have great hopes for this emerging actor.</p>
<p>Indeed, she is a talented person. Although she is new to the camera, her acting ability is by no means weak. She has courage, is willing to work hard, and is extremely serious, so she has already made amazing gains in "Autumn Fan Lamp" and "Wild Goose Descending on a Cold River."</p>
<p>The story of Diao Banhua's willingness to be beaten is particularly interesting. When she first came to film "Wild Goose Descending on a Cold River," she said to director Ma Xubang: "Mr. Ma Xu: I don't know how to act. Don't be polite. If I don't do well, just hit me!" This was naturally a joke she said out of humility, but we can fully see how interested and hardworking she is in acting.</p>

<h3 id="e221">Little Minister (2) <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Zhi</p>
<p>The banquet was extremely dull, and she was unwilling to listen to their conversations. But when they talked about recent events in the village, she became attentive. Recently, some manufacturers had bought a large number of spinning machines, which had driven down the price of cloth in the market. Babaina knew that the poor people who depended on spinning for a living would suffer severely. They were considering using the army to suppress them. The captain was trying to capture their leader. At that moment, the duke said, "Yes, but they are not easy to deal with. I know they are all prepared." The captain, after downing a glass of wine, said with a smile, "Ha! Prepared." At that moment, he felt really pleased because Babaina kept asking him about this matter, but if he had known Babaina's true intentions, he certainly wouldn't have been so happy.</p>
<p>Babaina had a good friend who was the only constable in this area. She was often with him, but tonight she particularly wanted to talk to him. She asked, "If the army comes tonight, will you still be here?" "The army? Originally, my heart was with those spinners, but my duty is what it is, and there's nothing I can do. Now, if three bugle calls are sounded, they will all come." "Three bugle calls?" she asked. "That's their secret signal hidden in the Artersha factory. No one else knows it."</p>
<p>Babaina left immediately, running as fast as a real gypsy girl, because the army was set to move at midnight. As she was running, she heard footsteps behind her, and she wanted to hide, but it was too late. She said with a gypsy accent, "Sir, where is the road to Shana? I've lost my way." It was the little minister. Seeing her distraught appearance, dressed in gypsy clothes, with beautiful curls of hair and dreamy eyes, he said, "Perhaps I can help you." "Ah, sir, please tell me where the Artersha factory is? I need to see my father." Juemin believed her and said, "I'm passing by there too, I'll take you."</p>
<p>They proceeded in silence. She felt there was something special about him. He and his mother had come here as ministers. Soon after arriving, he became friendly with the villagers. Originally, it was very difficult for villagers and outsiders to get along in a short period of time.</p>
<p>On the way, Babaina started talking. "I think you must be the little minister people are talking about." "I am the new minister here. They say 'little' minister?" "No, I misspoke, but it wasn't meant to offend you. I actually like your stature." She kept talking. She knew he must be wondering whether, as a minister, he should be walking with a gypsy girl. Finally, she asked, "They say you are against the conflict between the textile workers and the army." Juemin answered in a tone reminiscent of the Bible, "I am against conflict. This is the yarn factory."</p>
<p>As soon as Babaina ran inside, she saw the big bugle. But she couldn't blow it. She ran out again and said to the little minister, "Sir, they've all run away, this bugle is for calling people. They must have left it here for me. Please blow it for me, will you?" Juemin blew the heavy bugle for a long time. Babaina said again, "This bugle is very hard to blow, I don't think you can blow it any louder." Juemin blew the bugle loudly again. Babaina clapped her hands happily and said, "Please blow it again." So he blew it once more. After the three calls were completed, the village erupted in shouts and drumbeats, and the army and the villagers began to fight.</p>
<p>At that moment, Juemin really didn't understand what was happening. Then she was about to run away. Her parting kiss left the little minister bewildered. She smiled at him and said, "Mr. Juemin, I believe you have always liked me. Can a man stop himself from liking a woman?" He said goodnight to each other and left. Babaina returned to the village, no longer thinking about the minister. She knew he was different. He was going to obey the law, while she was going to lead the villagers to resist the army.

<h3 id="e222">Knowledge Needed When Buying a Car <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Junshan</p>
<p>Among hundreds of car manufacturers and hundreds of styles, choosing a suitable and economical car is not an easy problem to solve.</p>
<p>Whether buying a new car is appropriate depends on individual needs. Most unbiased buyers tend to let the salesman's silver tongue decide their choice. Therefore, in addition to continuously improving their products, car manufacturers are pushing their sales efforts to the extreme. To avoid being deceived by sweet talk and to hope to get a truly economical and suitable new car, reading what is described in this article will be helpful.</p>
<p>Cylinders and Fuel: The engine is the main part of a car. The usual numbers are two, four, six, eight, twelve, and sixteen cylinders. Generally, cars with more cylinders have more perfect body equipment and are more expensive. The power generated by each engine is based on the size of the bore, and the strength is not absolutely determined by the number of cylinders. In terms of comfort, more engine cylinders provide a more comfortable ride. For engines with the same horsepower, those with more cylinders consume more gasoline than those with fewer. Although gasoline seems like a small expense, when calculated across the board, the value consumed over two or three years can be equal to the cost of a new car. Wealthy people are willing to pay for further comfort without being concerned about this cost, but ordinary car owners may be very particular about it. If you are in the inland, where transportation is inconvenient and transportation is difficult, you should especially prioritize saving gasoline.</p>
<p>Choosing Horsepower: Choosing horsepower depends on the owner's use and road conditions. Too much or too little can cause the owner to suffer uneconomical losses. If the car owner intends to use the car to carry one or two people for office commuting, with a lighter load, they should choose a car with less horsepower. If the car is used by a salesperson who often carries goods and more people, it is best to choose a car with more horsepower. The quality of the road is also closely related to the need for horsepower. The horsepower required for cars traveling on flat and rugged mountain roads can differ by several or even dozens of times.</p>
<p>Determining Speed: Car manufacturers often specify a "standard speed" for speed, which varies from thirty, forty, to fifty miles per hour (some specially made vehicles have speeds exceeding seventy miles per hour). In detail, it means that the engine crankshaft rotates at one thousand, one thousand five, or two thousand revolutions per minute. Driving vehicles at this speed is most legal. Exceeding this number can easily damage the engine, and falling below this number is not economical in terms of fuel consumption. Road construction in my country is not yet developed, so the lowest standard speed is more suitable.</p>
<p>Electrical System Equipment: Although the principles of car electrical systems are the same, the devices are different. The strength of the lights, the loudness of the horn, and the important ignition equipment should be carefully considered and properly selected. Most American-made cars use battery ignition, while European-made cars have both battery and magneto ignition, as well as battery ignition. If the car you buy is used in commercial ports, all of the above ignition methods can be applied. If you are in a remote city with no battery charging facility, once the battery runs out of power, the engine cannot be started. At that time, it will inevitably be stranded, which is very troublesome. Therefore, cars used in the interior should preferably have magneto ignition.</p>
<p>Maintenance and Repair: Paying attention to the engine's efficiency and the ease with which diseases occur is the first priority when buying a car. Even those who are proficient in this area cannot easily have a definitive guarantee on this issue. Because the disease of a car depends entirely on the quality of maintenance and repair, and only a very small part is due to the manufacturer's rough inspection. In terms of the car itself, the more valuable the car, the more sophisticated the equipment and the longer the service life. Cheaper cars have simpler equipment and a shorter service life. The simplicity or complexity of maintenance and repair also varies greatly from car to car. For the average car owner, before buying, you should know a little about the structure of the internal organization, so that you can be more confident. Otherwise, in addition to comparing goods and prices, you should choose those that are simple in design and easy to maintain and repair. Because easy maintenance can reduce diseases, and easy repair can save money and time. Both are in line with economic conditions.</p>
<p>Body Style: The style of the body is like our clothing, and should be chosen according to personal preferences and needs. There are many types of bodies. The common ones are convertible cars, sedans, convertible roadsters, sedan roadsters, luxurious large sedans, etc. Convertible cars and sedans have five or seven seats, which are suitable for large families and for carrying a large number of people. The larger the body, the greater the load, so the consumption of gasoline is particularly high, and the engine's load is also heavy. Its service life is also relatively short. Convertible car bodies are simple to manufacture and cheap to sell, making them especially suitable for tropical regions and economical car owners. Sedan car bodies are complex to manufacture and expensive to sell, making them especially suitable for cold regions and people with ample economic means. Roadsters are also called office cars, and come in convertible and sedan styles. Because the body is light and small, gasoline is saved, and the engine's lifespan is also longer. But it can only carry one or two people, making it suitable for going to and from the office. There is a storage box in the back for carrying light items. If it is used for rental purposes, it is best to purchase luxurious large sedans and special rental-style convertible sedans.</p>
<p>Parts and Equipment: Before planning to buy a car, you should first ask yourself whether there is a dealership and service department for that car nearby and what the service is like. Are parts always available and what is the price of parts? The value of repairing and replacing parts for a car over three to five years is often equal to the original price of the car. It is inevitable that cars will be damaged after being used for a long time. After the damage, if there are no specialized skilled workers to repair it or if parts cannot be obtained, you will inevitably have to go to a coppersmith to have them made in the same way. These custom-made parts are always several times more expensive than ordinary ones, and their effectiveness is also lacking. The reason why Ford and Chevrolet cars have the widest sales is because the parts are cheap and easy to obtain.</p>
<p>Market Conditions: Before buying, you should also investigate the reputation and trading conditions of a certain car on the market. According to social judgment, some cars have a resale value that is almost the same as their original purchase price within one or two years of new use, while other cars have a greatly reduced resale value or are completely unwanted after being used for one or two years. Economical car owners should pay attention to this market demand situation.</p>

<p>— Fu</p>
<p>How much the finest automotive body materials are affected by light can now be accurately determined. A machine is now installed in the Marius Motor Company's testing room, which can make the impact of light on materials in 64 hours equal to the impact of a full year of strong summer sunlight.</p>
<p>Thus, in two and a half days, chemists can determine whether a sample material meets the specified standards. If the results are deemed satisfactory, another test is performed on the sample and the sample of the goods received. For example, the elasticity of the material used for carpets and the extent to which it can withstand the stepping of drivers and passengers must meet the standards. To know whether it meets the standards, you only need to use the machine to make it receive the same impact as stepping in a very short time, which is equal to the actual application for several months. Because Marius has this kind of machine, all the materials it uses are unusually fine and consistent with its noble standards.</p>

<p>Building the Most Perfect Tuberculosis X-ray Mobile Treatment Vehicle</p>
<p>Dodge Motor Company, under the order of the Public Health Department of the Department of Health and Medical Affairs, has built a tuberculosis X-ray treatment vehicle for mobile diagnosis. The chassis of this special vehicle is a Dodge 11/2-ton (240Cwt) model. The construction method is completely in accordance with the regulations of the department. The car body is divided into two sections except for the driving part. The rear compartment is where patients enter the vehicle, named the laboratory, occupying a five-foot space at the rear of the car body. All drug materials are stored in specially made medicine cabinets and drawers in this section of the car. In addition, there is a washing basin and a 30-gallon water tank to supply various hygiene needs and to wash X-ray photos. This section of the car is painted white and black linoleum is laid on the bottom plate.</p>
<p>The X-ray room is located in front of the laboratory, occupying a ten-foot space. There is a door between the two rooms that can be connected. All X-ray equipment and beds for patients to take photos are complete. The X-ray tube is flexible, so any part of the body can be inspected or photographed. Film storage boxes and washing basins are also available in the X-ray room. Once the steel curtain is lowered, the car windows are completely covered. Then the department can become a darkroom. The interior of this section of the car is painted black and black linoleum is laid on the bottom plate. The X-ray room is equipped with four 15-candlepower lamps and a motor-driven ventilation fan to ensure that the air in both sections of the car is well ventilated. The X-ray is powered by electricity, which is supplied by a special generator.</p>
<p>This mobile clinic is the most modern and perfect of its kind ever built. Since its completion, the medical and scientific communities have paid close attention and praised it.</p>

<p>In recent years, Henan Province has enjoyed local peace and stability, leading to a strong interest in construction projects. In particular, there has been rapid progress in highway construction. I will now inform readers about the construction of highways in Henan and Gansu provinces.</p>
<p>(1) Luotong Road: Starting from Luoyang, passing through Yiyang, Luoning, Lushi, Wenxiang, and other counties to Tongguan, it is 330 kilometers long. Construction has already begun on the Luoyang to Luoning section. The survey of the Luoning to Lushi County section has been completed. The Lushi to Wenxiang section has also been surveyed. The engineering team is currently building the roadbed for the Wenxiang to Tongguan section. (2) Lulin Road: From Luoyang to Linru, it is 85.8 kilometers long. The survey has been completed and construction is underway. (3) Zhouhuang Road: From Zhoukou to Huangchuan, it is 177.2 kilometers long. The road surface construction was completed in June. Bridge and culvert construction along the route is actively progressing and will soon be completed and open to traffic. (4) Nanxiang Road: Starting from Nanyang, passing through Xinye and Deng County to Xiangfan in Hubei Province. The road surface construction within the provincial border has been completed. The massive bridge project across the Baihe River is still under inspection. (5) Xinjing Road: From Xinyang to Zijingguan, it is 352.9 kilometers long, passing through Tongbai, Tanghe, Xinye, Zheng County, Zhechuan, and other counties. The survey has been completed and construction will begin once the funding is approved. (6) Shajing Road: From Shawo to Jingfu County, it is 25.52 kilometers long. Construction has already begun and it will soon be completed and open to traffic. (7) Xunan Road: From Xuchang to Nanyang, the roadbed earthwork for the entire road has been completed. The construction of bridges and culverts along the route is being supervised by the Construction Department and has begun in various counties. (wty, Lujing Road: From Lushi County, passing through Zhuyangguan to Zijingguan) is approximately 70 kilometers long. A survey has been conducted and construction is planned. Fanghuang Road: From Xiaofangjiaji to Huangtouling, it is 18.9 kilometers long. The earthwork for the entire road has been completed. It will be open to traffic once the bridges are completed.</p>
<p>Gansu Province suffers from poor transportation, which has led to the backwardness of industry and commerce. The provincial government, with the aim of actively promoting construction, focuses on highways. Therefore, it has formulated a provincial highway plan, which includes: (1) Ganling Road: Starting from Gaolan, passing through Yuzhong, Dingxi, Jingning, Longde, Pingliang, Jingchuan to Yaodian, it is 572 kilometers long and is an important route to Shaanxi. It is also known as the Gansu-Shaanxi trunk line and can connect with the Changwu Road in Shaanxi. This road was originally named Lanzhai Road. Although it has been repaired over the years, due to financial constraints, surveying has never been carried out. The estimated construction cost is 986,414,000 yuan. (2) Ganxin Line: Starting from Gaolan, passing through Yongdeng, Gulang, Wuwei, Yongchang, Shandan, Zhangye, Linze, Gaotai, Jiuquan, Yumen, Anxi to Xingxing Gorge, it is 1,481 kilometers long. The terrain along the route is quite diverse. Crossing the Jincheng Pass west of Fulan City and traveling west along the coast for about ten miles, it enters the mountains. Therefore, the project is quite grand. The estimated cost is 2,553,984,000 yuan. This road connects to Hami in Xinjiang and is also a section of the national Fujian-Xinjiang line. (3) Ganqing Line: Starting from Gaolan to Xiangtang, directly reaching Xining, it is 185 kilometers long. If traveling from Gansu to Tibet, this route is followed. It is extremely important in terms of politics and national defense. There are several cliffs along the route that overhang the river, making the project relatively large. The estimated construction cost is 319,032,500 yuan. (4) Ganning Line: Starting northeast from Gaolan, passing through Jingyuan to Xingrenpu and entering Ningxia, it is 237 kilometers long. If extended, it can reach Baotou, connecting with the northeastern provinces, making transportation quite important. The estimated cost is 408,706,500 yuan. (5) The First Gansu-Sichuan Line: Starting from Gaolan, along the Mengjiapu of the Gansu-Shaanxi Line, passing through Tongwei, Qin'an, Tianshui, Liangdang, Huixian, Cheng County, Wudu, Bikou to Chengdu in Sichuan Province, it is 854 kilometers long. The section from Huajialing to Tianshui already has a road shape and can be repaired. The area south of Tianshui is mostly a horse trail. The estimated construction cost is 1,472,723,000 yuan. (6) The Second Gansu-Sichuan Line: Starting from Gaolan, passing through Tao Sha, Lintan, Minxian, Xigu, Wudu to Bikou, it is 622 kilometers long. The estimated construction cost is 1,072,639,000 yuan. The first and second Gansu-Sichuan lines connect the wealthy areas of southern Gansu, control Sichuan to the south, and rely on Guanzhong to the west, making the geographical location very important. Of the above six major trunk lines, only the roads from Lanzhou to Xi'an, Xining, and Ningxia can barely be opened to traffic according to the old roads. However, all require fundamental construction. These six lines total 3,951 kilometers in length. The total estimated construction cost is 6,813,499.50 yuan. This is still a temporary estimate for bridges along the route. If semi-permanent structures are adopted and the excavated areas are widened to double-lane roads, the estimated construction cost will increase. If using semi-permanent brick and stone piers with wooden surfaces for bridges, the average cost is 420 yuan per meter, and approximately 2,100 yuan per kilometer, assuming five meters per kilometer. For special bridges with spans of more than five meters, semi-permanent structures are also planned, with an average cost of 450 yuan per meter, and approximately 150 yuan per kilometer, assuming one-third of a meter per kilometer. The average cost of stonework is estimated at 50 cubic meters per kilometer, with each cubic meter costing approximately 1.50 yuan, totaling approximately 75 yuan. Considering these costs, as well as labor and other expenses, the six major lines will total 13,026,447 yuan, more than double the previously estimated cost. The provincial government is currently gradually studying the steps for phased construction to facilitate development.</p>

<p>— Zhenmin</p>
<p>Ford Company's Losses Last Year: According to a recent report by Mr. Kamolong, secretary of Ford Motor Company, on the radio in the United States, the most notable thing is that the company's operating loss last year reached US$68,000,000. This news caused great shock to American women. Ford Motor Company is the largest automobile factory in the United States. Its manufacturing steps and management methods all adopt the latest and most scientific systems. The current result is quite unexpected. Henry Ford himself stated that the biggest reason for last year's losses was the rapid change in car body styles. Some cars experienced sluggish sales. In addition, last year's increase in workers' wages and other expenses remained unchanged, failing to offset each other. However, Ford's intention is quite firm, saying that this loss is just a very small experiment and has no impact on the overall situation. It is expected that this year's income will definitely make up for this loss.</p>
<p>German Auto Show Under Hitler's Command: Recently, Germany held a grand auto show that had not been seen for several years. Marshal Hitler personally attended the opening ceremony, which made the venue even more enthusiastic. German newspapers promoted the event as the world's largest auto show. In total, in this exhibition, except for a small number of American cars from Ford's branch, all other cars were purely German-made. A total of sixteen car factories participated, with more than fifty new types of cars. The most satisfying thing in the exhibition was the exquisite and compact engine manufacturing, with extremely high efficiency. The metal of the cylinder is a newly invented aluminum alloy, which can avoid rust and other phenomena, while increasing strength and promoting a very high compression ratio. Secondly, the progress of streamlining is also very significant. The material of the car body has almost completely adopted all-steel sheets, which are lightweight, durable, and very special. According to the interim report on operating conditions, Vnion had the best sales last year, and Dgimler was a little worse, but all factories had very substantial surpluses.</p>
