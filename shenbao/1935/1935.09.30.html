<p>— 都</p>
<p>—興築錢江大橋與完成滬杭甬鐵路—</p>
<p>滬杭甬鐵路之急待完成。殆爲全浙人士一致之要求。而欲實踐此目的猶。以建築錢江大橋爲其先决問題目。杭曹一段路某。其劵地與測量工作。早經着手進行。卽論娥江橋工。亦有基礎可尋。所不能異整個之設計者。無非錢塘一江爲之梗耳。與建錢江大橋一事。二十年前卽已有此動議。値歐戰突發議。亦旋寢。迄於今日。交通之接構日繁。橋樑之需要彌殷。以每日萬數千人之過往。而唯恃義渡爲轉運。匪特濡滯費時。抑亦易滋危險。且自浙與鐵路完成以後。浙東公路導猇進展。杭垣一隅。已隱然操轉輸之樞紐。徒以錢江橫亙於前。雞收脈絡貫通之效。影響所曁。實爲東南建設一大障碍。固不僅浙人之缺憾已也。浙當局亦知事實需求已迫。不容再守因循。乃毅然肩起重任。與鐵道部合謀建築錢江大橋。同時亦規畫滬杭甬路之完成。浙省夙以銳意建設事業著續。而滬杭甬路當局亦號稱爲能實心從事者。以兩方之協力。謀工稈之推進。則此兩項建設。自易樂觀厥成。吾人於建議伊始。旣已深致期許。今錢江大橋動工已將經年。而杭曹段亦有於明年元旦敷軌之說。於殷切期待之中。輒復揭櫫三義。以爲當事之勗。</p>
<p>其一。公共建設繫民生需要之殷。而上項工程尤遐邇希望所寄。皇皇舉措。衆具爾瞻。旣已着手進行。便應全力以赴。惟當司農仰屋之今日。吾人亦匪不知籌欵之艱難。按錢江建橋工欵。估定五百五十萬。原由全經會與中英庚欵委會撥借二百五十萬。由浙省府向滬銀行團商借二百萬。後以鐵部加入籌建。兩會臨時退出。另由鐵部向建設銀公司與中英銀公司合組之銀團商借塡補。工欵旣有著落。宜無製肘之憂。吾人猶盼當局保持指定用途。勿爲挪移嘗試。其他次要設施。正不妨以斟酌出之。比如興建大厦以壯觀瞻。在容許之環境中。原亦認爲可行。若遇籌措不易凑手。便應置之緩圖。而於公共建設如此兩項工程者。固不能令其有中道頓弛之虞也。</p>
<p>其二。我國官事文書。向以迂迴爲姘。一事賦予動稽狀日。旣感工作效率之虛糜。且易召致人民之疑猜。惟最近各省公路建設。均能在最短期問所著成效。不可謂非重大之改進。此次錢江橋工處職員。據說均能埋首力作。其間休沐。雖工程疊遭大水冲刷。難望如期完成。但爲意外打擊。自可有而勿論。今汛期已過。時地並宜。甚願主持其事者痛下决心。兼程奔赴。以期早觀厥成。用慰喁喁之望。而路局方面對於敷軌工作。亦宜猛著先鞭。迅籌進展。證之已往路局工績。如滬翔雙軌之敷設。市中心鐵路之設計。均不甚拖延時日。則茲回工事。當亦不致予吾人以失望歟。</p>
<p>其三。科學洛洛後之我國。向感技術人才之缺乏。楚材晋用。唯知乞靈異邦而已。巧年學校林立。漸多造就。顧自海外歸來之工程人員。每喜踏上政治之路。寖且自忘責任所在。橘踰淮而為枳。雀入水而化蛤。事慎惋惜。寗待深論。吾人以爲工程人員之入政界。原因無可非議之事第念所的使命之重。應思自謀貢獻之道以仕途爲發展之憑籍則可以做官爲單純之目標則謬矣今錢江橋工處所羅致之人才。類多國因工稈學者而各大學士木工程系畢業生。復多加入爲練習生。在暑假期內。並由八天學保送工程系之三年級生前往實習。是國人對於技術效能已知非常注視。足爲將來發揮光大之徵兆。吾人尤望各技術人員。在此艱巨工程之下。益豭鍊其身手。以蔚成峻整之風氣也</p>
<p>總之。興築錢江大橋與完成滬杭甬錢路爲相輔而行少偉與。亦人民一致之屬望。當事者應如何採取堅毅之態度。一洗泄杏之惡習。無論遭遇若何艱阻。要當臦勉以求其達。吾人不敏。固將據滿腔之熟情。拭目而俟其成功矣。</p>

<p>（倫敦）據報界公會今日聲稱、非俟續得詳情、意國最近之公報、不能同爲員使目前之時局稍形和緩此次公報似根據於意國所宣傳謬之見解、即阿案實際乃東菲英意兩國利益之爭執而立言、但英閣員已一再宣布英國在阿無自私之利益、英國全爲己爲國聯會員之一、始與法爭議有關云、意國是否擬作談判、而使軍事行動爲非必要、或志在於其已爲阿比西尼亞之主人後、與英國談判關於英人在東菲利益之協定、今尙未悉、惟有目前局勢中、此項建議似無多大價値蓋前一議含有在國聯外謀解决英政府未必贊成、後一議將不能避免阿比西尼亞之戰爭也（廿八日路透電）</p>

<p>華爾華爾乃在非洲阿比西尼亞東南邊增與意大利屬索馬里蘭東北邊境兩相交界之地、在發生事件（去年十二月五日）十二日以前、英阿邊界釐定委員會集議於華爾華爾（即去年十一月廿三日）討論英屬索馬里蘭與阿比西尼亞烏加登區之爭執問題、緣英屬索馬里蘭之土人、爲尋求水草起見、常向阿比西尼亞之烏加登區移動、冀得井泉及收塲、如是者已有多年、且經一八九七年五月之修約正式承認、但兩族土民間時有衝突、頗費調解、英阿間爲實行一八九七條約、確定雙方邊界、以杜糾紛起見、乃有混合委員會之組織、决定在華爾華爾地方集議討論、但在該委員會抵達時、已先有意大利之軍隊駐紮其地、並有防禦堡壘高懸意大利旗、英阿混合委員會之地點、且常有意飛機偵察探視、當時英方對此甚爲憤激、而爲避免引起嚴重糾紛起見、乃聲明暫時退往阿道、以待交涉、因之十二月五日、意大利與阿比西尼亞間發生衝突事件之時、並無第三者在塲目覩、而當時一切經過情形、遂成爲兩國爭論之重心、意阿兩方各執一詞作爲辯護、皆指對方首先開釁、有意挑戰、意大利則更以此爲口實、要求侵占阿國全部也、</p>
<p>在討論此事件責任問題之時、有一要點亟須决定、卽究竟華爾華爾爲何方頒土、根據一九〇八年條約之規定、所有接近海岸一帶土民居住之領域應歸意大利、所有烏加登區之土地及接近烏加登區一帶土民居住之領域、應歸阿比西尼亞、但此項比較抽象之規定、不能解决實際之邊界問題、於是雙方組織委員會、在一九一〇至一九一一年間開會討論、因雙方意見懸殊、毫無結果而散、但一九〇八年條約中之種族規定、極爲顯明、卽「所有烏加登區之土地及接近烏加登區一帶土民居住之領域、應歸阿比西尼亞」、華爾華爾爲烏加登區士民居住之地、應歸何屬、不言而知、尤有進者、在一九〇八年條約之外、當年雙方另有一協定、（由阿王默列克與意代表納拉志尼所商定、意政府於一八九七年九月三日正式電復承認、惟協定文字並未公佈）根據阿比西尼亞本年一月十五日致國聯之牒文、其中說明當時兩國協定、意屬索馬里蘭乃自印度洋海岸起平行綫一百八十英里內故述接久白河區至比面白代拉爲止、意政府當時並同意默列克之建議、卽在一百八十英里之範圍內、另在地圖上劃定「公斷邊疆綫」、由默列克本人簽字後、交由納拉志尼帶回羅馬政府、根據以上各點而言、阿比西尼亞之擁有華爾華爾、較有理由、蓋阿國聲明華爾華爾距海岸計有二百英里之遙、有默列克所劃定之「公斷邊疆綫」、又顯然屬於阿國方面、同時又爲烏加登區內之領土、無論根據一八九七或一九〇八年之條約規定、華爾華爾皆係阿國領土也、</p>
<p>惟在意大利方面立言、亦有其相當理由、蓋意大利在華爾華之實際佔領、已逾五年之久、有其地確係阿國領土者、阿國政府早應有所抗議、但五年以來、迄未見有此項聲明、足見阿國並非該地主權者、華爾華爾旣爲意大利已佔之領土、阿國軍隊及「暴亂羣衆」對意方之襲擊起釁、實係一種「侵略行動」、倘此種「侵略行動」、不加制止、則將有鼓勵非法軍事攻擊之危險云云、又據意大利軍事雜誌之論斷、倘一八九七條約及一九〇八條約均發生效力、則意阿間將有三種不同之邊界綫、是以應根據最後之條約（一九〇八（爲法定邊綫、所有華爾華爾華達依爾及達摩脫均應屬於意屬索馬利蘭之米皆要族、此外又根據一八八五年條約、奧皮亞亦爲意大利保護區域範圍之內、有權向東北內地發展、是以華爾華爾附近之井泉、亦在意大利領土範圍之內云、</p>
<p>目華爾華爾事件發生後、阿國政府根據一九二八條約要求仲裁、意大利則要求阿國赫爾拉爾地方長官道歉、懲辦肇事阿人及其長官、在華爾華爾正式向意旗致敬、並賠償二萬金鎊、阿國乃援用第十一條盟約向國聯陳訴、（去年十二月十四日）其後因意表示願進行和解、國聯乃暫不顧問、兩國商議幾經波折、乃於三月四日成立所謂中立地帶、（Gerlogubi－Ado－Walwal－Afdub均爲中立地帶）但阿國希望將整個邊界問題加以解决、意國則祗願討論限於華爾華爾事伴、雙方意見、又趨分裂、三月十七日阿國乃向國聯二次陳訴、並援用盟約第十五條及第十條、因此意政府已遣派大軍及軍用品赴菲、情勢日趨嚴重也、四月十二日當斯脫萊塞會議正在進行之際、兩國政府又商定根據一九二八條約成立仲裁委員會、是時意政府因軍備尙未充分完全、一味採取延宕政策、對於阿國之委任外人爲仲裁員（一爲法人M.de　la　Pradelle、一爲美人Pitman　B·Potter）表示反對、並指爲阿國無文化之暴露、以一堂堂國家政府、竟無學識能力充分之人可以充當出席代表、但此究係事實、意政府亦不能不作承認、委員會乃於六月二十五日有荷蘭首次集會、惟因雙方意見相距甚遠、（阿主全部解决邊界案、意則主張限制討論華爾華爾案）七月五日卽吿停北、阿國乃要求國聯指派第五伸裁員、因四人分據二端、無法處决也、國聯於八月三日開會、决定設法使該會續續進行、議案計分二點、（一）該會不必討論華爾華爾之誰屬問題、而應討論華爾華爾事件、（二）仲裁委員等應迅速進行並指派第五仲裁員、此案司謂需折衷之能事、第一點係敷衍意大利、第二點則遷就阿比西尼亞也並八月八日、决定委派希臘駐法公使飽里的斯（Nloolas　Politis）爲第五仲裁員、此後英法意三國代表、曾於八月十六日在巴黎開三國談話、謀將阿國利益彼此分配、惟因意大利態度、非英國所能接受、結果完全失敗、</p>
<p>所謂華爾華爾事件、自發生迄今全部經過、已具述如次、記者前已言之、此不過爲意大利進佔阿比西尼亞軍事行動之藉口而已、故在該案未發生前、意政府固已成竹在胸、早有打算、及至該案已發生後、意政府乃公然遺派大軍赴菲、謀洗刷阿圖瓦之恥辱、（意大利曾於一八九六年爲阿軍敗於阿圖瓦）並攫佔全部阿比西尼亞、以逐步實現其法西斯大帝國之雄心、所謂仲裁、所謂和解、及根本所謂華爾華爾事件、在意大利方面、僅爲其行動之工具而已、其全部野心之具體表現、英如七月三十一日意太利民報之社論、（該報爲墨索里尼所創辦、所有社論、據謂大部均由墨氏自撰）其論調日、「阿比西尼亞充滿被壓迫之奴隸固係事實、但此非意大利發動軍事之原因、種族問題亦不成爲主要理由、所謂文化滋輸亦非意大利所顧及、意大利之眞正目的祇有絕對不可非難之兩點、第一爲意大利民族之具體的需要、第二爲保障東非安全、欲解决此項問題必須全部討論而欲據張勢力或建立保護國則必須伴以軍事行動、東菲安全問題亦惟有意大利太身可以解决、所有意阿間之爭執、以軍事解决之、不獨簡便、且亦合理、吾人解决此問題、决依照此惟一途經進行、與國聯合作可、不問國聯亦可、甚至反對國聯亦無不可」</p>

<p>甲·烟禍的起源鴉片烟是印度的出產、在前淸初年、即輸入我國、當時全國人民、不知鴉片的害處、都把他當着消遺品看待、誰知在這種情况之下、不知不覺的、竟把我們許許多多的同胞、引誘到苦海裏去、造成不可解除的痛苦、自此以後、輸入的鴉片、日見增多、其流毒遂遍佈了全國、這時淸廷也知道鴉片的害處太大、不能眼見他蔓延、听以在道光十八年、命林則徐到廣東、辦理禁燜·緝捕烟商·沒收財產、因爲操之過激、反引起一塲鴉片戰爭、訂立了許多不平等的條約、使吾國在重重束縛之下、一直到現在、還不能舒展、經這次失妝以後、不獨鴉片的輸入、較從前爲多、就是國勢也一天衰弱一天、在現在回想起來、眞覺得痛定思痛、無淚可揮了、</p>
<p>乙·鴉片的害處從大的方面說、約有以下幾種、（一）影響國家的經濟、近幾年來、中國經濟入於破產狀態、這是無可違言的事實、其原因雖不止一端、可是鴉片及其他麻醉藥品的輸入、這種驚人的漏巵、也要算是致命傷的大端了、據民國十五年海關調查、山印度輸入的、有四千餘萬兩、由波斯輸入的紅土、有一千八白餘萬箱、此外嗎啡·高根·海洛英·等毒品之輸入、也有一百餘萬兩、再據大連一處的調查、在該處輸入的鴉片、有六十九萬八千八白九十七兩、價値在百萬在右、統計流出金額、總在萬萬元以上、中國本來就是一個入超超國家、再加上這種鉅量金額的流出、國家經濟、怎麽能不破產、人民的生計、怎麽能不困難呢、要想挽回利權替國家培養一點地氣、祗有禁絕鴉片的一法啊、（二）影響國家的健康、在任何一個民族裏、如果烟民過多、這個民族、必然衰弱、這是確切不移的定律、因爲精神萎靡的烟民、必不可能產生體魄健全的子女、將來一代一代的遺專下去、整個民族精神、必要婦於無形的消滅、我們中國各各民族、所以不為外人所重視、稱爲東亞病夫的原因、就是烟民過多、精神不振、以後要想維持我們的尺族、在生存競爭的時代、永遠佔着、個地位首先就要禁絕防害　康的鴉片啊、（三）影響民族的地位、我國自從鴉片輸入以後、歷年來與外國訂立許多的禁烟條例、「如前淸光緒三十四年、禁運嗎啡鴉月及藥針章程、宣統三年、禁限嗎啡來華一章、民國二年、海牙和平會國際鴉片條約、以及國際聯盟禁烟委員會歷次會議等、但是國內依舊烟禁廢弛、罌粟遍佈、把國際間的信用、同民族地位、墮洛到不堪設想的地步哪、還記得民國十三年、我國代表在日內瓦國際禁烟大會上、通過英國遠東鴉片調查團的提案、這都是極大的證朋、我擁人如再不覺悟、還把這害人的鴉片烟、當着消遺品看待、將來的禍患、恐不僅是民族的地位低落呢、（四）影響社會的治安、俗語說、一人窮志氣短一、這就說個人到山窮水盡、沒有錢用的時候、什麽竊盜的團體、就要去做出來了、我們也不能把窮的原因、都推在吃鴉片這一件事上、一切都市裏的罪惡有許多與吸烟無關、不過一個人吃了鴉片、遲早就要走上窮途、於是一切不法不道德的事情、在烟舖上呑雲吐霧的時候决定了、所以一個社會治安的維持、就是要看這個社會上的窮人多少、來决定牠難易的、換一句話說、這個社會上的吸鴉片烟人多了、就是一時的見不到、影響將來、這樣吸烟的人、勢必日暮途窮、沒法挽救、所以我們從社會治安的立塲上講、我們非得要把這倘造成社會貧窮和罪惡的重要一因子一、摒棄不可、（五）影響人民的食糧、但從到過四川雲貴的人、都知道這幾省的農田、早年已月多數改種鴉片了、把農作物反視爲附產啦，因此鴉鴉片的產量、日見增加、米麥的產量、當然就要日漸减少、這樣國內的食糧、怎麽能不缺乏呢、中國號稱以農立國的、以一個農業的國家、民食自己都不能維持、還要仰給於外國、這不用說、完全是受裁種鴉片的影響了、從小的方面、約有以下幾種、（一）戕賊個人的身體、吸食鴉片烟的人、終日總是一榻橫陳、過那呑雲吐霧願倒晨昏的生活、把所有的精神腦力、都是鴉片烟毒吸收殆盡、在身體方面、固然談不到强健活潑了、而且還要表現一種面黃肌瘦不可描摹的枯槁形容出來、所以一般人嘲笑烟民爲燜鬼、真算不了刻薄的話、嗜好鴉片的人、簡直說一句、就是自掘墳墓、自尋死路啊、（二）損失個人的經濟、吸食鴉片烟的人、最初也不過一時消遣、並沒有想到經濟上的損失、可是成癮以後、就覺得欲罷不能了、明知道耗費金錢、也只好安心忍痛、在不覺不知之中、把一份家產傾蕩無餘了、最後、也有變爲乞丐的、也有流爲盜賊的、這種習見的事、不知若干呢、這是多麼痛心呀、（三）破壞家庭的幸福、一個家庭裏、所以雍陸融洽的、就是因要各人能負責任、來做事賺錢、假使有一個人不務正業、習染上鴉片嗜好、不獨家庭中多了一個廢人、同時生產必然减少、支出格外增多了、日久下去、經濟也非破產不可、還許骨肉變爲路人、夫妻成爲怨耦、甚至演出意想不到的慘劇、因爲有一個人吸食鴉片、牽連影響到整個家庭的幸福、鴉片的害處、這樣酷烈、爲什麽還不决心去成除呢、</p>
<p>丙·禁烟的决心和步驟鴉片烟的流毒、足以亡我國家、滅我秤族、自經林則徐實行禁烟失敗之後、不論淸廷也吧、北洋軍閥也吧、都繼續在舉辦禁烟、可是爲什麽、禁烟一直到現在、還不能禁絕呢、原因不外有二、（一）政府對於禁烟、沒有澈底禁絕之决心、（二）政府對於禁烟、沒有切實易行的辦法、因爲過去的禁烟、祇有吸食鴉片治罪的條文、沒有剷除烟苗分期禁種禁吸的根本辦法、所以鴉片的出產、年年增加、吸烟人與、也年年加多了、現在蔣委昌長對於禁烟一項、着實下了最大的决心、從根本着手、採用以前國民會議議决的六年禁絕鴉片方案、决定自本年始、至二十九年止爲禁絕期間、除嚴訂章程、分期禁種以外、關於禁止吸食鴉片採用兩個最有效的方法、就是一方而提倡新生活運動、來轉移社會風氣、鼓勵民衆去協助政府禁烟、一方面出科學的方法在極筆平與極有系統的原則之下、使烟民分期戒除烟癮、其入手的初步、就是要舉辦全國烟民總登記、知道全國烟民總數、以爲分年遞减烟民的標準、本市秉承政府禁烟的計劃、已經於七月用治登記了、從七月起至九月底、為自動登記期間在這個期開內、准許人民自動投戒或領照、十月起至十二月底止爲强迫登記期間、在這個期開內、就開始拘捕私吸人犯、依法判處罰金、以後山行勒令登記、至關於禁烟步驟項、則遵照政府的計劃、定爲六年、自本年起至二十九年止、六年分期禁絕、其步驟各項、（一）自二十四年七月至十一、月、辦理烟民登記、發給限期戒烟執照、（二）自二十五年起限期戒烟執照、停止發給、所有已經登記的烟民最少要有總數五分之一的戒絕、尙未戒絕的、換領新照、（三）二十六年、已經登記領照的烟民、級少要有五分之二的戒絕其尙未戒絕的、換領新照、（四）二十七年已經登記領照的烟民、最少要有五分之三的戒絕、其尙未戒絕的、換領氣照（五）二十八年、已經登記領照的烟民、最少要有五分之四的戒絕其尙未戒絕的、換領新照、（六）二十九年、已經登記領照的烟民、應律戒絕、戒烟執照繳銷、丁·登記的意義和手續（一）爲什麽要登記、禁烟的呼聲、亦數十年來、雖不多隨時隨地、皆可以聽到的、而結果還是禁者自禁、吸者自吸、這固然是在軍閥時代、不免爲斂財手段、同時也是沒有完善的辦法、現在政府看到過去禁烟未得到相當效果、所以在兼籌並顧之中、想出一個登記方法來、因爲要實施禁烟、第一步就要知道、全國烟民的總數、在總數裏再分析靑年人有多少、中年人有多少、老年人有多少、得到這個統計才可以逐步推進、將烟民分年遞减、使得一般烟民、在奄無痛苦之中、能够從容戒絕、假使還係過去那神漫無統計的辦法、又不給予烟民一個戒除的相當時間、就想立刻把流毒數十年之鴉片、一朝禁絕在事實上是絕不可能的、故政斷言一句、禁烟最有效的方法、而且使烟民戒烟最不感痛苦的、就是登記、（二）登記有什麽好處、所謂登記一、並不是領了一張執照、以後就成了一個官吸鴉片烟的、再不會有人來干涉你啦、若是存了這種思想、這便是大錯特錯了、要知烟民登記、一方面是政府表示禁烟的决心、與喚醒烟民的注意、一方而是使登記的烟民、知道吸烟的期限、還有幾年、在這幾年之中且酌自己的吸量多寡、逐漸减少、可以如期戒絕、脫離苦海、成了一個健全的國民、或者感覺到吸烟的痛苦、就可以立時請求公安局、送到市立戒烟醫院裏、免費替你成除、這種優待、只有登記的烟民、才可以事得到的呀、（三）不登記有什麽壞處、這次政府施行禁烟、是具有極大的决心、不是如過去奉行故事掩飾耳目的了、具所以先要登記、這是爲着顧全事實上的困難、與免除烟民的痛苦、如果烟民不明瞭政府這種决心與厚意、還是觀望不前、當作從前迭次禁烟奉行故事的禁令看待、將來過了登記時間、不獨不能再行請求登記、就是想着免費戒烟、也得不到了、並且查出來、還要受極大的處罰、烟民們、仔細想一想、這是何苦呢、難道就想永遠沉淪在苦海裏、情願做一個國家不容同胞不齒的下流人嗎、（四）登記的手續、關於一切登記事項、係由本市公安局負責辦理、凡請領普通戒烟執照的、應先塡具登記聲請書一紙、親赴公安局或公安局所屬的各分局所、聲請登記、公安局或各分局所、即根據填發執照、至領貧民執照的、除填具聲請書外、須另具保證書紙、經派員調查以後、再發給貧民執照、至於請求戒烟的也須照竟塡具聲請書、保證書、經調查明白後、即送戒烟醫院、免費施戒、本市公安局、爲顧書烟民覓保困難起見、特規定保證人之資格、凡係烟民的親友、有確實住址、正當職業的、都可充當、倒不一定去尋覓舖保、領貧民戒烟執照的保證人、祇要保證烟民幷不冒充貧民、請求戒烟的保證人、祇要保證烟民、於戒絕出院後將來定期來傳送調騐時、烟民不致故意逃避、並無其他責任的、所以充當烟民的保證人、也不必多所顧慮了、</p>
<p>戊·禁烟的希望　（一）對於吸烟人的希望、吸食雅片烟的人、應當知道雅片烟害處、不僅個人的名譽同事業、受極大的損失、就是國家民族、也要受極大的影響的、希望烟民對於戒烟要當認爲最愉快的事、最有利益的事才對、因爲烟癖或除以後、就可以恢復健康、成爲一個有用的國民了、在個人方面、再不會受人輕視、在國家方面、也可以從此復興啦、（二）對於種賣人的希望、種植與販賣雅片的人、應當知道、這種營業、是不上當地且犯法的、一經查出來、比處罰不登記的烟民还要嚴厲、何苦　做這種有害於人不和於已的事呢、希望你們以後把種植雅片的用地、趕進改種五穀、把販賣雅片的資本、趕緊另謀其他營業吧、萬不可再輕身嘗試、在此次禁烟政令下、做一個犧牲者啦、（三）對於一般人的希望、不吸雅玲烟的人、固然是很好、可是抱定一個獨善其身的主義、看見別人吸烟、當着與我毫無關係、這已不能算是把國民的責任、完全盡到了、因爲無論一個國家或講社會、均是由多數人集合而成的、假使烟民過多、這個國家與社會、　不能健全、本身雖未受到直接雅片烟的害處、但是間接也要受着莫大的影響的、希望大家對於吸食雅片的親友、或有關係的人、如能切實勸導、立刻戒絕最好、否則也、勸他快去登記、羣策羣力的、來輔助政府、逐步完成禁烟的要政、這才是做國民的道理哪、我們最後的口號、是一·禁烟是社寒漏巵及救貧的最好辦法、二·禁烟是復興民族的先决問題、三·禁烟是恢復國際地位的一秤策略、四·禁烟是强國强種的原本要圖、五·禁烟是政府目前最决心努力的要政、六·禁烟是實行新生活的基本方案、七·希望全國同胞一致恊助禁烟的工作、上海市禁烟委員會、上海市公安局、印發、</p>
<p>禁烟標語（一）雅片之害甚於洪水猛獸、（二）雅片是喪身蕩產亡國滅種的毒物、（三）吸食雅片、是時時刻刻犯法的、（四）有烟癖的人、估專决不會忠實耐勞的（五）有烟癖的人、做事决不會遵守時間的、（六）有烟癖的店夥、决不會存操守的、（七）戒除烟癖、如同由死路走上生路的一樣、（八）戒除烟癮、是去了你一生的贅累、（九）烟癖一不戒除、將來决不會有人用你、（十）禁絕雅片、國家貧弱、才有轉機、（十）（一）禁絕雅片、國際地位、才能增高、（十）（二）禁絕雅片、是總理救國最要之遺訓、（十）（三）禁絕雅片、是政府最大决心之政策、（十）（四）烟民快來登記、免得拘捕刑罰、（十）（五）烟民請求戒烟、不化錢、不痛苦、（十）（六）烟民登記、是禁烟第一步的工作、（十）（七）烟民登記、是求烟民總豐、爲分年逐减的標準（十）（八）登記是烟民的權利、和最安穩的辦法、登記證書、是烟民目前必要的保障、</p>
<p>禁烟文吿（電影片用））現在政府决心禁烟、定期六年禁絕、吸燜的人、暫時不能戒的、趕速到本市公安局及各分局所去登記領照、决心戒烟、可以投請馬上送往戒烟醫院戒除、是不要化費一分文的、吸烟是犯法的、惟登記領照、可以免除罰则、觀望懹疑就是自陷法網、上海市禁烟委員會宣傳組、上海市公安局、發佈、</p>

<p>男子組</p>
<p>小徐球藝尙須進步</p>
<p>一時半比賽開始邱飛海代替林寶華出塲、老邱近來已漸漸恢復原狀、惟體力究尙不如、第一第二兩盤、邱以六比一六比四連勝徐煒培、第三盤已感覺精力不濟、在極艱苦之中、才以十二比十得勝、徐爲港地後起之秀藝在李惠堂之上、其所以退列第三單打、原欲免港方全軍覆沒、不料昨日仍爲邱敗也、徐球藝較全運會時進步不多、其球以斬切式出之、球飛甚高、成弧形而下、力量薄弱、反手更無把握、有時在網前尙佳、邱昨日一二兩盤備極精彩、第三盤已軟弱、徐曾自一比四追上、以五比四超出、卒以無把握、平手數次後、以十比十二爲老邱得勝、</p>
<p>女子單打港方吿勝</p>
<p>港方威爾遜夫人、年少力强、技簽可取、各式擊法俱能、不但球好、姿勢亦十分佳妙、摩爾夫人年邁不善奔、爲失敗之主要原因、亦年事之高下分勝負也、第一盤威以時沂時遠之球、以六比〇勝來極易、但第二盤氣力漸覺不支、摩爾夫人之兩角抽、使威疲於奔命、摩以六比二奪回、休息十分鐘後、形勢大變、威又恢復其體力、精彩再見、以六比一又勝、</p>
<p>卡德輕敵幾乎悞事</p>
<p>壓軸戲第一雙打、滬方卡德兩大將、得勝毫無問題、且此塲已不關勝負得失、一二兩盤、在卡德兩人揮拍之下、六比一、六比三、何家鎏洪渭釗全非敵手、然而一東、卡爾生竟大力集快敵、以爲隨隨便便、即可得勝、不料從此一誤再誤、何洪扶搖直上、以六比一奪回第三聲、第四盤滬隊在五比二佔先時時、一氣竟連下四局、結果以七比九再敗、於是卡爾生知不能再隨隨便便、稍加用力、以六比二結束、完賽時、已慕靄四合、上燈時矣、何洪有此成績、亦足自豪，</p>

<p>球藝總評</p>
<p>總觀雙方球藝、上海隊投手甘鋮、接手甘瑞康、與上紡投手黑岩、永松、接手水松、技能均在水平綫線、雖昨日雙方均無特殊貢默、但其峻急幻屈、功夫已屬老到、三疊人材、亦頗稱平均、惟上海隊外塲太弱、迎接高球、十有九空、即如高松第八局中之平球、捕捉頗易、而於跨下漏過、殊屬失之交臂、否則上紡於此局中、祇多一人可以同歸本壘、繼之昨日失敗原因、乃外塲失誤太多、有以致之、以雙方安打記之、上紡得分雖多、其安行爲九記、而上海隊亦有五記之多、且曾英曾有一記三壘打、曾瑞琪曾有一記壘行、上紡祇水公一記二疊打足、證攻勢尙强、但上紡廠係本市勒旅之一、且捧球爲日人之國技、上海雖攻、不是爲奇、於全運會時、錦標希望固甚濃厚也、</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「他們不會知道，裴伯伯不在家，裴太太忙着服侍坦第；他有了喉症一類的毛病，她一步也不能離開他，我們不會坐到深更半夜，也不會有聲音，還有什麼妨礙呢？」</p>
<p>「假如我們将燈點得长久了，亞西便會知道，她遇到這樣的時候總會覺察的。」</p>
<p>「不，她不會的，我爲此已預先備了一隻暗燈；這不會透出許多的光，並且我們聽到有人來了，可以立刻把它關上」，唐恩說道，這個意思乃德聽去殊覺動心，以爲新命可喜，他立刻出去通知韜摩，卻又重復探進頭來說道：</p>
<p>「你也要小橋的不是嗎？」</p>
<p>「不，我不；你如吿訴了這個道學先生，他要挺起兩個烏珠對你說通，並且他們已睡者了，所以祗向韜瞟着一眼，立刻回來。」</p>
<p>乃德遵照他的話，一會兒就回來了，後面跟着韜摩，衣服只穿了一平，頭骨逢蓬，瞌睡顚倒，可是正像他的行徑，已預備着來一同作樂了。</p>
<p>一現在不要饗，我敎你們怎樣玩一種了不得的遊戲，名稱叫做「撲克」，唐恩說道，其時那三個也知作樂的年靑人早已團坐着桌子，桌上放着一個瓶，雪茄與紙牌，「讓我們先喝一點，再來大家啣了「一根」同來玩撲克，這是大人們的做法，選眞開心呀」。（註二）</p>
<p>（註二），「一根」所以譯Weed原係指雪茄烟捲等而言。</p>

<h3 id="c169">多餘的話 <a href="#c169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— 隅</p>
<p>照例說幾句話。那似乎是多餘的。一件事物的本身，自有其某種限度的價値存在。並不須個人的主觀的過高的或過低的評價來肯定或否定其存在。事實上經過一個人的眼，由其主觀的選探，而就認爲這局部的選擇，足以代表一切，或不足以代表一切，逍難免陷於錯誤。我們不能因我們的好惡而肯定一切，正如我們不能因我們的好惡而否定一切一樣。不過我們必須明白這一點，那就是：一件事物由客觀的存在而達於社會對於牠有最高的評價，那一定不是少數人的提倡，而是由於多數人的需要。那些自以爲我是××大師，或我是××開山祖的人，把一件事物發生的過程—目其開始及其發展—抹煞了一切，而歸功於僩人的力量，這未免太重視那不十分重要的小我，而忽略在他自已以外的大我。這是由於昧於實際者居十之五，而由於主觀的驕妄者居十之五。個人如果平心靜氣，去其驕妄，把實際的情形觀察淸楚，就會明白，個人的力量，眞是藐乎其小。明白了這一點，那末我們就可以同樣明自近來小品文—或某種人所謂雜文，特別發達，並不是某特種人，或某特種團體提倡的結果，而有足以使它發展的客觀的條件存在。那就是近代經濟機構的變革，機械文明的發達，使每個人的日常生活，都在高速度的進行中，捲入這漩渦中的人，除開我輩住亭子間的朋友，以文學爲吃飯的工具，或者那些優閒階級，要自鳴廣博，還讀那長長厚厚的長編鉅著的小說外，大多數市民，已沒這樣餘閑。這樣，短小精悍，富於刺激性的小品文，自然就會變爲一般人最好的精神食糧。小品文的發達，那末就是其必然結果了。</p>
<p>講到這地方，也許有人要提出異議，認爲這情形在歐美也許是對的，在中國却未必然。中國人有的是空閒，你在內地，你可以看到玩一隻烏會化去一早晨，一杯酒會喝了半日，一壺茶會消磨了一整個的下半天，吸幾筒雅片會消耗了一生世。你到處可看到懶散，遲緩。走路像螞蟻樣爬，做事像懶牛樣進行。你也許就要問高速度在什麽地方呢？緊張的生活在什麽地方呢？不過你轉眼來看一看隨洋人大砲一同進來的大都會及其影響所及的城市，也許就是給你一個淸楚的印象。你在早晨晚上的柏油路的轉角，你可以看到路的當中，車輛是風一般的馳騁着，人是潮一般地湧着，一個動—高速度地動的都市陳列在你前而，而在這都市裏面的人，雖不一定都是過着高速度生活的人，然而這高速度的旋律，却多少都是波及他們的頭上。有了這樣生活形態，有了在這生活形態下的一部分人，自然適合這樣生活的社會機構也發生了。自然在都市中，就有供這些人消費的特種組織，有供這些人消費的特種娛樂塲所，自然在同時也必然有供給這些人的特種精神食糧。黃色新聞，「蚊子報」是一種，幽默雜誌圖畫雜誌又是一種，較純正的雜誌報章，又是一種。在這樣情形之下，於是所謂柔性文章，遂空前發達了。</p>
<p>就中國近年夾載所謂小品文的小型雜誌的特殊發展講，推究其實際，還有一特殊原因，那就是一方面因社會的矛盾日趨深刻，把握住了這現象，而毒辣的諷刺文學遂特殊興盛，消極者不過「寄沉痛於幽默」，而積極者，自然有一種敎訓的意味在內。他方面，又因國民經濟的日趨蕭條，國民購買力的萎縮，購買較貴的書籍，變爲特殊階級的權利已不是一般人的能力所能及，新出版的書籍，已無人過問，而價格較廉的雜誌，成爲太衆購買的目標，乃必然結果，而雜誌業的狂飚突起，也不爲無因了。</p>
<p>這樣的現象是好是壞，那是另一問題，不在本文討論範圍以內，不過小品文的發達，自有其自身價値，决不會像一般人所罵爲一文不値的。同樣小品文的發達也决不是偉大作品產生的障碍。我們雖承認「小說的獨霜」（Tynanyof　Fiction）的時代已經過去，我們却不能承認小品文的發展，乃小說題材枯窘的結果。這種意見，小泉八雲在幾十年前曾經講過。小泉八雀認爲二百年來歐洲小說，以戀愛爲主題，差不多已將各種題材，各種形式寫盡，以後的小說須我一條新的路，什麽是小說的新路，他並沒有吿訴我們，但他吿訴我們將來散文（Essay）與速寫（Sketch）一定會占文學重要的地位。中國過去幾年，三角戀愛，四角戀愛的小說，雖也曾勃興一時，可是這些小說並不足代表一切，也並沒有把題材做盡了。中國小說今後似乎已有了一個共同的新趨向，有其遠大的前程，而小品文的發展，實是並行不悖的。這無須我來替小品文辯護，不遠的將來，事實定會吿訴我們。</p>
<p>當然就這兩種本質講，小品文的寫作，份量是較輕的，寫作也是較易的，形式也是較自由的。隔壁死了一個老太婆，可以拿來做小品文的題材，汽車軋死了一個小狗，也可以拿來做小品文的題材；小品文可以寫宇宙之大，也可以寫蒼蠅之微。不過小品文異於小說的，那就是你只須用最簡單的筆，描寫一個事物的輪廓就够，你無須像小說一樣，用幾百頁的文字寫一個人半天的生活。正如現代的漫畫一樣，你只須用幾筆把一個人或事件的特性描摹出來活現於紙上就盡了它的功能了。所以你描畫一個西哈諾，你只要畫一個大鼻子，你要畫魔俠董吉訶德的荒唐舉動，你只要畫一個騎瘦馬的武士去閙風車，你要畫卓必靈，你只要畫」雙大皮鞋或畫一條手杖，或畫一條小鬚子，你要畫瓊克老馥，你只要畫一對大眼，就够了。能够把握這一點的，我相信一定能够寫成一篇好的小品文，忽略這一點的，我相信一定是吃力不討好的。我的選擇的標準，就是如此，其中是否有主觀的錯誤，那自然還有討論的餘地，而我所潠擇的是否都合乎這標準，那自然也是很難講的了。</p>

<p>— 孟華</p>
<p>每天夜晚，我擺脫了所有的職務之後，就帶着「身的疲累走出了店門。看慣了那昏黃的電燈光，一出店門我便有點昏弦了。我聽不見那囂雜的市聲，看不見那美麗的夜的街景，茫然地，像在沙漠上一般的孤獨。我只是焦急地拖着這倦怠的身子轉入一條胡同，再抹過幾道，拐灣，向我的家走去。</p>
<p>在一所門漆剝落的屋子外面，我站住了，這就是我的家。我靜靜地在門上敲了幾下，監聲而來的是年老的房東。門開了，我邊答應房東的招呼，一邊怱怱地走進去，開了自己的房門，扭聞　電燈，一樣茫然地坐在椅子上。</p>
<p>就在這時候，我開始了家的默念。</p>
<p>「這就是我的家嗎？」我像淵習故踝似的這麽問我自己。是的，我還有只一個家，我離開它已經快十年了。但一離開它。我便沒有個時候想到它，盤旋在我臘際的却是新的，未來的家，一個又幸臨又溫柔的家。在那里我可以把一天的疲累完全恢復過來，一點亦感不到厭惡與煩膩。</p>
<p>「這並不是自私者的企求，亦不是俗物者的觀念，就是雞亦有一個榯，狗亦有一個窩，人，那能無一個家呢？」我時常對自己這樣辯解。於是我又沉入在我的理想的海洋里，我們未來的理想這海洋里了，這樣，我就彷彿渾身浸在春日和煦的陽光里躺在柔軟如茵的草野上，我覺得生命的可寶與生活的舒快。</p>
<p>然而，我傍窗而坐的這個家，是一座又漱溢又樹髒的房子。房子外面堆着爐灰，房子里而亦堆着爐灰，棹子上，檯子上，書架上，臥床上都撒下了一重厚原的，薄薄的灰燼。燈光又是如此陰黯，人又是這麼的疲累。看到了，聽到了這些，我人失望而又憤怨地從理想的圈子里跌下來了。我聽見這上那轟隆轟隆的電車聲，浮沉在人海里的那些悲哀的小販們的呌喚，以及　房東　，　期的肺病的咳嗽。</p>
<p>我是，我的思想又轉入另一條黑暗的小胡同了。</p>
<p>「我又不是有着一個這樣成天在咳嗽着的母親麼？」我這樣想。是的，我曾聽過人家這樣說過。因爲當我剛剛接觸着陽光的時候，我的母親便永遠捨下我了。在我的記憶裏，爸的印象亦是糢糊的，彷彿是一個又黑又瘦的高個子，因爲他在我會走路的時候便丟下我，要下他這殘破的不成樣的家到外地去了。於是我在另一個慘酷的，用鞭撻人家的孩子來發洩私憤的姑母手下撫養大來。在剛剛會走路（自然這是一條社會的路）的時候，我就橫了心，學着我的爸的樣出走了。十年夾我是一個無家的人。他是爲着個理想出走的，那是很顯明的事情，而他的孩子亦是為着一個理想離開那所謂家的，那亦是很顯明的事情。然而到現在我們誰亦不知道誰在有意地方，亦許他爲着那那理想而紀　命完結了吧？我這可憐的爸爸。</p>
<p>房來這聲音又在我思路中斷中時候過來，因此我史覺愴然了。</p>

<p>— 凌鶴</p>
<p>整個的夏天，我跟着孩子們在鄉閒消磨過去了。</p>
<p>旣然到了鄉間，離開朋友們已經很遠了。因而他們大半將我遺忘了，這稿子也不像以前那般緊迫，而我也就輕騐了許多。除了返孩子們笑樂而外，對於居停主人的幾隻鴿子的起居，也很發生興趣。</p>
<p>一共是四隻鴿子，主人將牠們分做兩間屋子住着。由於主人吿訴我，我知道牠們是兩對夫妻。樓上的一對，並無生育。樓下的一對，却已生了一個小寶貝了。當人們在煩瑣生活的忙碌中，可以聽見那小生命在不住的唧唧的呌，那是飢餓待哺的呼號。於是做母親的便忙着給孩子哺食，和父親輪流着。一天又一天的過去，慢慢的看着小鴿千身上長着零亂的硬的羽毛。看來牠們的生活雖是忙碌，但也很平安快樂。</p>
<p>鴿子，在藝術家的眼中，是當作和平之神的。這時候，我也懂得鴿子確是可愛。</p>
<p>有一天早晨，天色尙未大白，我愛好夏天之朝的淸凉，便獨自起床了。打開大門，虜甜的凉風迎面撲來，使我覺得胸部突然寬大了許多。庭院中的竹葉，凝聚着珍珠般的朝露，不肯輕易散落下來。我有意赤着脚在草地上來回的走着，我的雙脚給露水洗得太乾凈了。在這境地中，我便深深的理會得夏天的可愛了。</p>
<p>忽然在我頭上響着一陣洪亮的哨鈴聲，這也給人淸朗之感，原來是一羣鴿子飛過。誰知不幸的事便從這兒開端，當天吃午飯的時候，我便首先發現那一隻做了母親的鴿子飛走了，因爲不見牠在桌旁拾飯粒。一直到黃昏，事實上證明了那小鴿的母親並沒有回來。去了，去了，也許永遠不再飛到牠丈夫和孩子的身邊來了。累得居停女主人抱怨着說：</p>
<p>「就是那張家大屋呀，眞不做好事。天天早上放鴿千，給管嗚嗚的叫，把別人家的鴿子都引了去。我那這一對是花一吊二百錢買的，現在去了一隻，多可惜呀！」</p>
<p>女居停主人的話，我不敢半個說錯字，至少一吊二百錢現在飛去了一半，不能不讓她心痛一番。而且我早就曉得，她所以要鴿子，爲的是媳婦遴門了三年多還不曾給她養下半點血，經過老林醫師的診斷，說是要滋陰，於是兩次便買來四隻鴿子了。她和媳婦親口說過一，等到小鴿子也有了兩對，然後大的便殺給她一僩人獨吃。婆婆對待媳婦兒有如此寬大的恩惠，那真是世問少有的了。前不久孵出了一個小的，着實使女主人快樂一回。然而現在生了一個，又失去一個，一抵一，正負相消，仍然沒有一個多添。自然囉！也許眞的是媳婦兒的口福不好。而婆婆的怨天怨地，也自有她的道理了，</p>
<p>我不知道鴿子是否也懂得失戀的悲哀，但是我確看見那鰥着的雄鴿子，兩三天來，委實不安；一會兒飛到屋頂上咕咕的叫，一會兒又在巢旁咕咕的呌。牠頸上的毛盡力散張開來，可是除了那沒有母親的孩子在喞喞的向父親討吃而外，再也沒有妻來理會牠了；而樓上的一對，也只是自由自在的朝牠看看，似乎是沒有憤恨，也沒有同情。</p>
<p>憑着我的想像，張家大屋一定是金碧輝煌的高樓大厦吧。那末鴿棚子也一定是富麗堂皇的吧。當然囉，那兒鴿子們的食料也一定很好吧，因而每一個雄的都會有一身極美麗的毛羽。在涼風習習的早上，牠們快樂的高飛雲霄。憑着主人紮在牠們脚上的鈴管，發着洪亮的聲音在天空中饗吊着，那是何等使牠們同類羨煞的啊！於是這一個年輕的母親，擺脫煩惱的育兒生活，離開她的質樸的丈夫，跟着到張家大屋去享受享受，又何常不是合乎情理的呢？</p>
<p>不知怎末的，大概是人世間的憎恨還不曾將我的同情心完全磨滅，對於那一隻鴿我很是關切。從失去了妻子以後，我看見牠更殷勤的哺育着孩子。牠將嘴張開來，讓孩子使勁的仲着喙從牠喉頭裏去啄取米粒。牠忍受着疼痛不住的向後退，而孩子却是迫緊着鑽進牠的喉之深處。自然，這對於牠是一種不可卸却的義務；哺育自己的孩子，小心守候着孩子慢慢的長大起來。牠的妻可以不負擔這種責任，但是牠却不能啊！難道牠也可忍心遠足高飛，丟下孩子活活的餓死麽？</p>
<p>牠每天要飛到屋外去幾次。也許是去找尋牠的妻，那將永遠使牠失望的吧。再不然便是去屋外找尋食物。的確，女居停主人，有時也爲着鴿子們慷慨的撒幾粒碎米在地下，然而那是少到可以數得出來的。而且樓上的一對拚命的搶着啄取。不怕牠嘴的動作十分敏捷，到底不過是三一三十一的平分。可是牠的一份要養活自己還要養活孩子啊。但是就憑着牠微薄的力量，在這凄凉慘酷的人世間，又能找着多少人們所多餘的食物呢？</p>
<p>和每一種動物偏愛着自已的子女一樣，這可憐的父親愛護牠的兒也眞是很盡力的。牠不用嘴給孩子抓癢，梳理着毛羽，將漸次脫落的乳毛啄去。很見着油光烏黑的新毛漸次在孩子身上生長起來，牠的歡悅那該是如何濃厚啊。</p>
<p>本來這也是很自然的事，對於一個失了母親的孩子格外覺得可憐，同時加倍的愛護；大槪這鴿子也有這和人類相同的靈感，所以當樓十的那隻雄鴿飛近自己的窠巢或者在門口站了一下的時候，牠便拚着性命和牠撕打，爲了防禦牠侵害牠的孩子，一直到牠離開了爲止。可是當樓上雌的一隻走近來的時候，却並不打牠，祇是咕咕咕的表示風流的輕薄，像對待失去的妻子一樣。這也許是一種性的反應，可是那雌的却睬也不睬走開去，這未免是一種難堪的侮辱。正因爲如此，使牠對那雄的更加仇恨，好幾次我看見牠們無緣無故的打着，從高高的鴿棚上跌下來，羽毛被撕得散落着，血也流出來了。</p>
<p>我常常這樣想；連和平之神也會撕打着，難怪人類的戰爭是何等自然的行爲啊，雖然那也是非常可怕的。</p>
<p>孩子是一天一天的長大起來。披着一身光彩的毛羽，居然會從棚子上飛到地下來了。可是在這時候的父親却脫落了頭上的毛。孩子的羽毛豐滿，而自己却贏得一個禿頭。我自私的默念淸。這到底是爲着誰呢？一直到我從別人嘴裏得着證明那新長成的孩子便是牠的女兒的時候，才知道原來牠是在女兒身上懷着很大的希望的哩。以後，我果然看見牠幾次跟在女兒後面咕咕咕，像對樓上那雌的同樣輕薄，可是女兒却每次都冷冷的躱開了。不，假使女兒並不使她失望，那末牠的禿頭也不是沒有代價的哩。我默默的禱着牠願望的成功。</p>
<p>暑期過去了，我依然悄悄的回到原住的地方來。將近二月的鄉居，到底留給我不少回憶的資料，慧如道可憐的鴿子，也便是我有時懷想着的。從鄉間的來信中，吿訴我那新長成的雌鴿，又和牠母親一樣也飛到不知去向的地方去了。我不知道是否應當爲那雄鴿憂悒，可是牠那可憐的禿頭，好幾次在我心頭一晃一晃。</p>

<p>— 甲辰生</p>
<p>遇着了年歲的荒歉，田裏頭沒有收穫，農民們生活失所憑依，爲了飢驅寒使，沒法兒，向當地官應裏請領一張護照，他們結伴成羣，扶老携幼，走奔他鄉，到異地去就食，這叫做「逃荒」。</p>
<p>「逃荒」，本是一種無可如何情勢之下，不得已的一回事，然而，事有出人意料者，竟有把「逃荒」當做常年職業的，這眞所謂奇風異俗了。</p>
<p>江蘇的阜寗縣，所屬鄉鎭，有幾處地方，民俗非常的慓悍，他們習以爲常的生活，每年到了秋收登塲以後，農事已畢的時會，不論年歲是豐是歉，闔村的人，大家便聯合起來，到縣裏去請張護照，家家拋棄了家園之樂，都去做背井離鄉的「逃荒」人，由秋而冬，在異地飄泊着過他們的流浪生活，直到翌年春暖花香的時候，大家才賦歸歟，再回去耕耘自己的田地。</p>
<p>譬如這一個村上，有一家人家，因爲自己田裏的收穫，很可以够生活，不願意和他們一齊到外面去「逃荒」的話，那是不行的，那麼，全村的人，就首先都到你家來喫，把你家所有喫個一乾二凈，結果，還得跟他們「逃荒」去，因此，稍爲有飯喫的農民，早已遷徙一空。</p>
<p>每年到了秋收時節，阜寗縣政府照例要預備若干護照，等待他們來請求，幾乎成了刻板文章，官府對於這種怪習俗，也無法可以制止，否則，他們不出去「逃荒」，便會在地方上滋事的啊。</p>

<p>從前的一般富貴人家對於喝茶也總是很講究的，茶葉最好的要買到一二十兩銀子一斤，的確也可算是奢侈品的一種，惟其是奢侈品，我們的太后便分外樂用了伊所喝這茶是否眞比外而所有的特別的好，我可小敢說，祇知道它們的價錢都是大得很駭人的，次無一二十兩銀子可以買到一二斤的話。太后每次喝茶都得更換新茶葉，而且還歡喜把各種晒乾的花朶，如玫瑰，茉莉之類，混在茶葉內一起泡開來，取它們那般香味：共中尤以野天冬花更受太后的讚賞，伊的茶碗內差不多每大必有幾朵野天冬花浮在上面。</p>
<p>荷花的花瓣也是太后愛吃的一種東西，在夏季裏，常敎御膳房裏採了許多新鮮的荷花，摘下它們最完整的瓣來，浸在用鷄子調和的麵粉裏，分爲甜鹹兩種，加些鷄湯或精糖一片片的放在油鍋裏炸透，做成一種極適口的小食。還有在春大，約莫淸明節前後，那些高大的玉蘭花才開旺的時候，太后也得把他們採下來，依着利用荷花的方法，煎成又香甜又淸脆的玉蘭片，隨時吃着它消閑。</p>
<p>上苑內所種着的花木旣是如此之多，而每種花木又必須有人去時時照料，因此給太后充園丁的那些太監的工作，委實是十二分的繁劇了！單就菊花來講，還祇是一種時令花，祗在秋天要需要人照料，雖然我們有很大的暖房蓋着，儘可把它們維持到過冬，但需要照料的時間大部份總在秋天。似乎可以不致怎樣忙繁。（四二八）</p>

<p>世界各國的帝王或領袖人物，是常常被人注意的。他們不論走到那裏去，總有幾千百雙的眼睛注射在他們的身上，好似做了衆矢之的。在歐洲大陸上，凡是帝王或太子等出行，總得簇擁着許多軍警，偵探，與便衣偵探等，隨時隨地的保護他們，不然可就疑神疑鬼的寸步難行了。要是參加什麽公共的典禮，那更是非常的緊張，彷彿步步都是荊棘，處處都是危機。但是王室中人在英國是很自由的。任是別國的帝王，因本國起了革命的風潮，蒙塵出走，被政治上的暗殺黨追逐着，也往往以英國爲唯一的安樂窩。即如西班牙廢王亞爾方沙退任後，也在英國作寓公，他儘可公然的在餐館中或看看賽馬，玩玩球戲，何等的自由自在，他覺得世界中再也沒有比英國更安全的地方了。</p>
<p>然而不測的事情，也許會發生出來，所以英國的警探，對於王室中人，也盡力保護着的。開名世界的蘇格蘭塲，有一個特別的部分，專管保護從別國來的王室中人或總統等領袖人物的。每逢這些國賓在維多利亞車站上跨下火車的時候，就有蘇格蘭塲的偵探們，在暗暗地跟隨着了。</p>
<p>英國的王室中人是不必保護的，他們儘可隨意往來，不怕甚麽危險，因爲他們是都被國人所敬愛的。人們常能瞧見年靑的太子們，上電影院看電影，進餐館就餐，或在公共的跳舞塲中消磨他們一天的餘暇，而在大陸上的太子們，是享受不到這種樂趣的。他們一出宮門，總是軍隊夾道，武官緊隨，簡直好像是押解罪犯一樣。</p>
<p>英國的太子們，不但在本國並不戒備，就是到國外去，也隨隨便便的，不怕意外的襲來。有一次，太子格羅昔斯德公爵，搭了郵船往愛屯去，船上的搭客中，有很多的印度人，很是嘈雜，那時船上得到無綫電信，據說印度孟買地方發生了大罷工和抵制英貨的風潮，已和警察起了衝突，船上的印度靑年們聽了這消息，羣情激昂。然而公爵仍很鎭靜的在甲板上散步，在游泳池中游泳，或玩種種的遊戲，一些兒沒有顧慮，他也並不防備印度人的襲擊。</p>
<p>在埃及不安定的時期，暗殺黨到處橫行，而英國長太子威爾士親土却坦然的在開羅的街道中柱來遊行，他也不帶甚麽防身的武器，只挾着一校打高而夫球的木棍罷了。</p>
<p>當然，那暗地裏的保護，是少不了的，每逢威爾士親王和閒雜人等混在一起的時候，往往有一個闊肩而强有力的人，在遠遠地跟隨着，盡他保護的資任。此人名白德，先前是蘇格蘭塲一位著名的偵探，他也是因保護王室中人而出名的。白總的冷忠於威爾十親王，始終不懈，親主到那裏，他也到那裏，委實好像是他的影子一樣，並且來去飄忽，很有神秘的意味。親王曾用種種的方法，試騐白德的本領，確是警犬一般的機警，親王同他的弟弟們在一起時，總是津津樂道的。</p>
<p>親王每到電影院中看電影時，那麽白德一定在後排的客座中。親王有時吸完了他最後的一枝捲烟，那麼白德自會走將上來，獻上一包親王所愛吸的捲烟。親王要是走下一個煤礦時，到了四面漆黑的最深處，而白德却已帶了一盞提燈，趕將上來。親王有時到聖銀臺高而夫球塲時，而白德早已挾着球棒等在那裏，親王曾千方百計的想躲過白德，可是難得有一次的成功。</p>
<p>任是親王用飛行的方法，也躱不過白德，他早已得了消息先就搭了另一架飛機去了。到得親王從他的飛機上走下來時，那麽在門口扶着他的手臂的，即是白德。白德的兩個闊闊的肩頭，幾乎擔當着親王一身的安危。</p>

<h3 id="c180">中國人民之擔稅狀態 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— （趙超構）</p>
<p>一　人民之擔稅能力</p>
<p>一國財政不足的彌補，不外（一）發行公債，（二）曾稅，公債至發無可發，而又轉向到增稅，但曾稅的結果，是增加人民的負担，故無論稅制之良惡，須察有無用稅之能力，假使人民担荷已達最高限度，增稅之危險更大。從來扣稅論的中心（一）增稅可達如何限度，（二）國民能否負担最高限度之租稅，從前有一派重稅樂觀論者，以為惟　有重稅可以致國家於繁榮；又有一派貨幣循環論者，以為租稅不過爲貨幣少循環，對人民不致有多大犧牲。然而這兩派的理論，究竟不能獲得一般人的同情。根據常識判斷，輕稅論始容易引起一般人的共鳴。不過一味相信輕稅論，也是危險的；國家愈進化，政府所負的職務愈紛繁，經費支出自逐漸膨脹，政府沒有相當的收入，如何可以克盡厥職呢？故現代財政學家既不贊成站在政府方面說話的重稅論，亦不贊成媚俗悅家的總稅論，大家有一致的主張，便是以人民的租稅能力爲標準，决定國家所課人民的稅額。租稅論之引起財政學家之注意，即基此種公平的觀念。就如歐戰結束，恊約國賠償委員會在决定德國賠欵總額時，曾檢查德國租稅制度，把德國人尺的負担程度，與協約國人民的負担程度相比較，以决定德國償付賠欵的能力。</p>
<p>二　國富所得與擔稅力</p>
<p>國富與國民所得，大都是假定的數字，當然不能認爲精確。惟在大體上總不失爲測定國民負扑力的一個標準。根據租稅的經濟原則，國家對人民所課的租稅額，决不可侵蝕國富，僅可於國民所得中取之。所以國富與國民所得，與租稅的負担力是有重要關係的。現代國家之租稅體系中，均列有財產稅與所得稅，此二稅均以財產與所得，爲真接的裸稅物，其稅額之大小，自直接决定於國富與國民所得之多少。日租稅之本質，就廣義言之，均是所得稅，蓋無論徵收何種租稅，都是從國民的所得中劃分出來的。故欲測定國民的負担力。可以國民所得爲直接標準，國富爲間接標準。茲先列各國國富額，以與我國國富相比較。（下表數字單位，上行爲日金百萬元，下行（每人平均富力）爲日金一圓）</p>
<p>各國國富額之比較</p>
<p>國富額　每人平</p>
<p>均當力</p>
<p>美　七六二、三五六　六、七〇七</p>
<p>英　一三六、三二〇　五、一四七</p>
<p>法　一〇三、三二〇　二、五四九</p>
<p>日　一〇二、三五三　一、七二一</p>
<p>國富額　每人平</p>
<p>均當力</p>
<p>德　七一、六八五　一、一四一</p>
<p>意　四四、七八六　一、二七</p>
<p>中　三八、二九六　九〇</p>
<p>上表抄自日本內閣統計局出版之一列國國勢表覽」。關於中國國富之數字，註明係一九二二年調查。觀此表我國與列强國富相差至堪驚人，每人平均富力較美國相差七十三倍以上，較英國相差五十九倍以上，即較之東鄰日本，相差亦幾達二十倍；我國人民負担租稅力與各國相較，亦可以此相差之培數爲比例。換言之，如果日本國民每年只能負担二十元租稅，則我國人民每年只可負州兩元，而美國人民則可負担四十元。這固然不能作爲精確比例，然亦可窺見我國人民租稅負担力之薄弱。</p>
<p>由從國民的平均所得與和稅負担上比較，也可看出我國人民負担能力的薄弱。</p>
<p>各國人民平均所得之比較</p>
<p>中國國民平均所得的數字，雖是日人高橋秀臣的佔計，自難精確：但以現在情况，與九二二年比較，中間經過多次的兵匪災禍，中國國民所得祗有减少，决不致比從前增加，這是可以常識斷定的。關於中國國民租稅負擔的平均數字，國內還沒有統計，惟就各種零星的統計看來，都只有增加的傾向而無减少。單就農民的負擔說，據中央農業實騐所的十六省六白七十八縣統計，各省水田旱地的稅率如下：</p>
<p>再據非正式的調查，陳翰笙氏推定中國農民的田賦負擔，至少占總收入百分之五，據馮節「中國田賦研究所載，汀南富庶區域，以無錫爲例，田賦占總收入百分之十一，廣東福建一帶田賦占總收入白分之十四以上。至於川黔等內戰區域，田賦竟有超過總收入。農民每年總收入中，除了耕種成本費用，再加上田賦負担，以及生產品的貨物稅，消費品所轉嫁的賦稅，還有甚麼凈所得？又據德人Wagner於民國十四年統計山東各縣田賦，沈善微氏統計浙江各縣田賦，與各國農民負担比較如下：</p>
<p>山東農民負担比</p>
<p>一九二二年美國農民　高四倍</p>
<p>一九二四年印度農民　高—四倍</p>
<p>浙江農民負担比</p>
<p>八六六年普魯士　高六十倍</p>
<p>一九二　年美國　高十八倍</p>
<p>一九三一年日本　高八倍</p>
<p>中國人口以農民佔多數，從農民負担的高度，儘可以看出中國人民租稅負担之奇重，與此後負担力之薄弱了。各國的租稅負担，工商業亦佔主要地位，然就我國新來，今日工商業担稅能力亦至有限。一則因爲內地經濟破產，購買力减低，再增加工商業的租稅負担，生產品的銷塲益狹：二則我國工商現正在外國工商業重壓之下，加重中國工商業負担，無異助紂為虐。這兩點不必費辭解釋，只須看看近年統稅加稅後，中國棉紡火柴捲烟等新式工業之衰落，即可知工商業已失去担稅力了。</p>
<p>我們再來觀察我國一般城市中產階級與薪俸階級的所得狀况，以與各國比較，便可知其担稅力之薄弱，與其他其他階級無異。下面一個表是國際勞工局在一九二〇年——二九年間的詳細調查，統計數字比較可靠，關於中國部份之數字，係根據北平四十八家半年的家賬，所統計成的，調查時期爲一九二六年。</p>
<p>家族平均人員及每月所得</p>
<p>支出內容，支出共計等於一〇〇）</p>
<p>根據第一表，可以看出中國城市中產以下階級，以及薪俸勞工階級收入之微少。根據第　表，可以看出中國一般家庭經濟狀况之可悲。「以與各國相較，收入最少，而支出以食物費爲最大，依照經濟學上的恩格爾法則，愈窮的人，其食物費支出所佔的比例愈大，中國一般人生活，正與這說相合。其他文明人應受之娛樂教育生活均無力享受。還有能力担負担重一點的租稅嗎？</p>
<p>三　財政支出與人民擔稅力</p>
<p>上面已說過，雖然人民負担同一的租稅額，其犧牲的程度亦未必一致。測定人民租稅負擔力時，除考慮國之國富與人民之所得外，尤須注意於財政之實况。其主要者有兩點：</p>
<p>首先，須注意國家經費支出之情形，如果經費用於生產方面，則現所徵收之租稅，仍可流入經濟界，扶植生產事業，培養將來的稅源，這樣又可以增加國富與人民所得，人民雖擔負租稅，亦不致有重大的犧牲。這類支出，財政家稱之爲租稅的循環作川，人民是可以負擔得起的。反之，如果經費支出於浪費事業，或與生產無直接關係之事業，則租稅循環作用，完全停止，人民祗覺到犧牲的痛苦。實際上就是摧毀人民的負擔能力。</p>
<p>以中國與各國比較，經費支出幾乎有一個共通情形，便是軍務費與佔務費之鉅大，這兩種支出，都是屬於非生產的。中國電費與債費之鉅大，原因在於內亂未平，各國軍費與債費之鉅大，一方面爲歐戰的結果，一方面爲準備現在的國防，就其支出之意義言之，又截烈不同了。茲將各國軍費債費支出出的百分比，列表於下，以資比較。</p>
<p>各國軍費佔費與總支出之百分率</p>
<p>註本表採自日本內閣統局編之列國國勢</p>
<p>要監關於中國數字由三十三年度預算算出</p>
<p>從上表，可知軍費債費之鉅大，雖爲各國共通現象，然實以中國爲最，換言之，雖然中國經濟落後，人民貧乏，而財政上之非生產支出，則爲各國冠。</p>
<p>關於發展實業，扶械生產的方法，各國除採用關稅，滙兌上諸政策，以保護國產外，尙從交通運輸各方面設法保護。中國目前完全還談不到這些。在預算科目中，伴列有國營事業費，建設費勉強可稱爲生產的支出，然而建設偏於公路，軍事上性質尤較經濟上的性質爲重。國營事業雖屬生產支出，對於今日人民產業，尙少直接的利益。我們試返觀各國，除建設國營事業爲政府之職責所在，每年支出不計外，單就政府對於民營事業的補助費獎勵金，已達下列數字：</p>
<p>各國產業補助金支出與總支出之白分率</p>
<p>註…本表錄自（League　of　Nations）</p>
<p>Statiotical　Year-book</p>
<p>中國現在的一般產業，外受列强資本商品之壓迫，內受農村破產的影響，已入崩潰時期，如連接的增加其負擔，（請參考本報第一期尹伯端之二十三年度財政設施的短批評）直使各種實業，無再生產之能力，無異殺鷄求蛋的辦法。如此下去，不特人民之犧牲日增，即將來政府的稅收亦有吿竭之一日。去年七八九一個月關鹽統一稅同時銳减，即證明人民擔稅已達極限之點，即使增加稅率，亦未必能够照稀率增加的比例，收足租說。</p>
<p>（四）財政支出與人民所得</p>
<p>財政支出中，有一種可以算做人民的準收入，與人民擔稅的能力也很有關係。這類支出在各國為文化教育，衛生，社會設施三種經費，在中國僅有文化教育費。這幾種經費的支出愈大，則人民所享受的獲利亦愈大，可以减省人民本身對於這種感情的消費負擔，無形中等於人民的所得。這種經費支出愈少，則民本身所負擔之教育，衛生，社會事業費愈大，無形中等於人民之支出。所以，人民負擔租稅雖然重，如果政府對於這種經費的支出能够增加，人民的犧牲稈度亦可减輕，不致妨害人民的擔稅能力。</p>
<p>此外，政府對於人民的撫恤金，也是人民的一種收入，這種支出如果多，當然可以增加人民之福利。由於這利支出而增加稅收，不但不足以增加加一般人民之犧牲稈度，反可以安定社會秩序，平均人民的富力分配，茲將中國與各國之此秤支出，列表比較如下。</p>
<p>各國社會費與財政支出之百分率</p>
<p>各國恤金支出與財政支出之百分率</p>
<p>從上表比較，可見現在我國財政支出，眞正用之於民，比率很低。這結果，使社會的財富一入國庫。便無歸還之望，人民納稅的犧牲得不到相當的補償。又無力京受文化人的生活，不得不陷於貧，病，愚，弱，的地步。</p>
<p>否則，國家經費之支出，雖有生產的與非生產的之別，其實沒有絕對界限，非生產的支出，有時亦可間接扶助生產，增加人民的所得。如各國的經費支出，大多數仍在國內，即軍務費支出增加，實屬浪費性質，亦足以刺激國內重工業之繁榮，因而解决一部份的失業問題。我國工業之後，重工業尙未達自給地步。軍費支出之中，關於新式器械軍需品的補充，航空建設等經費，都落於國外，對國內經界絕鮮利益。建設公，本屬生產的支出，然公路之發展，在今日適足以助長遠東煤油之消耗，這種支出實是落於國外的。我國輸出的物既不足以抵袖輸人，則這部份的支出即等於國民財貨之喪失，這也是减弱國民經濟租稅力量的一個重原因。</p>
<p>五　租稅制度與人民擔稅力</p>
<p>租稅制度亦足以影響國民之租稅力，國家裸稅原則上應以人民的担稅力為標準，如吳租稅的負擔向落，勞苦民眾頭上，結果為增加國民的犧牲程度。對於富裕階級多裸稅額，其犧牲程度可報載。所以同一數額，租稅，亦視其稅源之如何，有不同的影響。照理論上說，直接稅優於間接稅，所得稅又餞於消費稅。因直接稅的負擔固定，不能轉嫁，繳納間接稅的人則可將其稅額轉嫁於貧苦民衆。所得稅以人民的收入爲課稅標準，能適合人民的擔稅力，消費稅。對於人民所消費的財。貨課稅，當與其擔稅力不相稱。所得稅課於特定收入的個人或法團，故不能轉嫁，即直接稅。消費稅例於消費品達到消費者之前徵收，最後轉嫁於消費者，故爲間接稅。在現代國家中，直接稅日趨重要，而我國和稅，則專恃間接稅，其弊審時賢均有關論列，不必再述，此處僅將中外租稅收入中，直接稅與間接稅所占百分率，列表如下　，以資此較。</p>
<p>各國直接稅及間接稅所占歲人之百分率</p>
<p>註…抄自Statietical　Year-Book　Leaqueof　Nation</p>
<p>查我國租稅收入，以關鹽統三稅爲主要，而此三稅則均爲消費稅為消費稅本來不一定是壞的，不過我國的消費稅則完全爲不合埋的。消費稅最重要之一原則，爲課稅於奢侈品，免課生活必需品。蓋愈是窮困的民衆，其消費支出中生活必需品的比率愈大，愈是富裕的人，其消費支出中生活必需品的比率愈少。爲適應租稅能力起見，生活必需品應免課稅。但我國租稅收入中，鹽稅即占百分之二十以上，而鹽稅之負擔幾全部落於貧民身上。其他間接稅，如關稅·統稅·差不多亦什麼轉嫁於平民身上，其坐擁戶資的官僚富豪大腹賈，所負擔的租稅眞是微乎其微。</p>
<p>六　我國國民之擔稅狀態</p>
<p>我們就上面各項觀察，雖然未能提出一個正確的數字，表示我國國民的擔稅狀態，然以我國之國富，人民所得，財政支出，租稅制度諸點觀察，我們可獲得一個中國人民擱稅狀態的概念如下：</p>
<p>（一）就國富與國民所得觀察，我國國民的擔稅能力較任何國爲低。</p>
<p>（二）就我國財政支出觀祭，政府取之於民者多，用之於民者少，非生產的支出多，生產的支出少，支出於國外者爲數又不在少。若之，民衆祇有犧牲，鮮得補償。富力逐漸喪失，稅源未有培養，擔稅能力，逐漸降低。</p>
<p>（三）就政府之債務費支出觀察一國家每年從一般人民徵收租稅，幾以其三分之一，償還債務，無異犧牲全國民的財富，以供養少數金融資本家。這樣的支出，不特不能平均人民財富的分配，反促成分配不均的現象。而使大多數人民的生活水準，愈趨低下。</p>
<p>（四）但就和稅收入的內容觀察，政府課於有稅能力富裕階級之租稅目有限，大部租稅爲可以轉嫁於貧民身上之消費稅。</p>
<p>誠然，一國國民的擔稅限制，是有仲縮性的，除了物質的條件外，僅有精神的條件與時代的背景，平時的不能承受的犧牲也許在國難時期可以忍受下去。但要人民忍受這種犧牲，必須國民黨能認識國組的意義與自已的責任：（二）須國家的稅制公平，人民始無怨言，（三）尤須租稅的負擔不致侵入人民最低生活的水準。以我國人民知識位低下，稅制之不公，國民生活困苦，到底還談不到這種精神上的條件。</p>
<p>七　担稅限度之觀察法</p>
<p>總之，人民租稅能力是有限度的，超過這個限度，則人民的犧牲太重，必誘發一般經濟的衰落。而且國家稅收，亦閃之發生累退的現象。不過，租稅負担能力的測定，並不能單獨以人民所得及租稅額的多少爲斷，還須考慮財政支出的方向與租稅收入之內容。因爲有這種種的綜錯關係，所以在事前判斷人民扣稅力限度的精確數字，幾不可能。惟在達到担稅力限度之後，自然可顯著的反映於一般經濟界。我國經濟現狀。正是人民担稅力已達最高限度的反證。我們”從事後判斷人民担稅是否已達最高限度，可以仿照消威斷所作「德國繁榮指數」，做一個中國繁榮指數未作具體數字的測量。道威斯繁榮指數所根據的材料如下：</p>
<p>（一）國家榆昌入總額，（輸出减退，表示國際收人之减少，輸人减退，可表示國內購買力之衰退。）</p>
<p>（二）租稅收入數額與稅率增减之比例。（稅物增加，稅收人能以同比例增加，關表示人民担稅力已到限度，故發生稅收累退現象。）</p>
<p>（三）鐵路輪船之運輸量。（交通運輸之减少，表示商品述通呆滯，山面不振。）（四）經費支出之內容。（袖助金，卹金，救濟費之增加，表示民力疲乏，所得减少）　。</p>
<p>（四）烟，酒，糖，煤炭的消費量，與消費者所支付之總至額。（由於生活必須品嗜好品消費數之增减，以及此等貨物之價格，可以觀測人民生活之富裕或於因。）</p>
<p>（六）國當統計，出生統計，死亡統計，人民移動的統計，（由於人口之變動，可反證一般經濟情形，譬如農民離村數目之增加，即爲農村負担苛重之結果。）</p>
<p>（七）每人食鹽的平均數量。入學兒童與失學兒童比例之增减狀况。（這都是推斷人民生活狀態的側面材料）。</p>
<p>要之，租稅之征收，若超過一定限度，則財政與經濟同時開始衰落，財政之衰落爲稅收累减，經濟之衰落現於國內產業與對外貿易之减退，同時影響於人民的消費生活，經過一定期間後，即擾亂人口的自然增加率與結婚率。繁榮指數之用途，即在反映此種綜合的現象。不過這方法只能作為事後研突的工具，不能作事前之判斷，担稅力限度是無聲無臭的，財政當局的責任就在事前謹慎小心，考慮良好的財政政策，使租稅負担不致超過限度。事前不努力預防，等到事後百病發時，纔設法補救，這就費力了；即說補救得好，也不免焦頭爛額了。我國現在財政，既不能多發公債，又不易增稅，要找到出路，總要從各方面精密考慮一下。　一九三五，五，十九。於朝報館</p>

<p>序言</p>
<p>今天蒙各位，駕臨敞所來聽演講，兄弟感到非常的榮幸。</p>
<p>本草研究這問題狠廣汎，兄弟現就力之所及，使我國已有的藥材，及國醫本草的研究和使用，走向科學的道路上去：所以今天特提出講講。</p>
<p>就歷史方面講：在二三千年以前，那時代卽有將本草用於治療的事實；而本草這名稱，意義卽指藥物。其中包括了動物植物鑛物三種。不過，當時用以治療疾病的，大都是草根樹皮之屬。因此：當時就用本草二字來代表，以後鑛物和動物，亦被利用為療病的藥物：但本草二字，仍是相沿使用。今本題所講本草，也就是指一切的藥物而言。</p>
<p>我們中　一向多是用植物類的藥物治療疾病的。在西洋　昔治療疾病，亦多以草木植物爲主。近來科學一天天的發達，醫藥的使用也隨之有不斷的改進。如發明了愛克司光鐳錠內分泌素　　都　醫療上佔　重要的地位，這是醫藥同人週知的事。可是他們這新的藥物的發現，都是依　了科學的學理及實騐為出發點的。我國過去的本草研究和使用，方和現在西洋國家有點不同，就是大多憑着想像和經騐而决定的；直到現在似乎還是這樣，這自然是要求進步中的一個大大的阻力。</p>
<p>我們知道在現在有許多疾病，尙沒有特効藥去應付和撲業它。在這方面看來，中國原有悠久歷史的本草，實有研究的必要與價值。以科學方法去闡明證實牠的可利用的原質，立刻便能縱橫應用於世界上，而不致令人發懼。近來，日本以及西洋有許多目光銳利的醫藥家，對我國的藥物，已開始特別注意，發生了研究的興趣：不過他們是用科學實騐的方法去研究探討的。這似乎令我們居在中國的醫藥人員，感到莫大的興奮。我們有許多國文的本草文獻；有許多本草的標本在我們眼前：更有許多本草仍被中醫繼續不斷的使用着：所以在種種觀點上——文字方面及文獻標本實習等，我們對本草的研究，較之西洋人佔有極便利的優勢，而能得事半功倍的効果。鄙意以為我國人，凡對於本草有研究興趣的，都應當聯合起來，埋頭苦幹，在世界醫藥之中，定能放出點燦爛的光輝！</p>
<p>在此有所聲明的，就是：本草的科學研究，兄弟今天所講，自然不能說是完美：不到之處，有特　者之指教。</p>
<p>本草之起源</p>
<p>講到本草的起源，不能不先述本草這一個名詞，究竟於什麼時代才有？這是很値得查考的。回顧我國的歷史，我們知道史記裏沒有見過本草這名詞；史記的作者，是漢朝司馬　；由此可知漢初時還不曾有本草這個名詞。戰國時，誰都知道扁鵲是那一時期的名醫，但在扁鵲的時候，也沒有本草這名詞。就事實看去：則漢武帝以前，實沒有本草此名。到後來，在漢書郊祀志裏，始見有本草二字的記載。現在且從漢書專看到關於本草二字之原，錄之於後：</p>
<p>漢書郊祀志（漢成帝建始二年卽西紀前二一年）</p>
<p>『方士使者副佐本草待詔七十餘人皆蹄家』</p>
<p>漢書藝文志方技略（劉歆）</p>
<p>『經方者本草之寒溫量疾病之深淺假藥味滋因氣感直辨五苦辛致水火之齊以通開解結友之于平』</p>
<p>漢書平帝記（西記五年）</p>
<p>『徵天下通知逸經古記天方歷算鍾律小學史術方術本草及以五經論語考經爾雅教授者在所爲駕一封詔　詣京師』</p>
<p>王莽時（西紀十年）樓護傳</p>
<p>『護少　父爲醫長安出入貴戚家護誦醫經本草方衛十萬言』</p>
<p>其次關於本草的起源，就研究所得，可分三種如下：（一）神仙和方術；（二）煉金煉丹；（三）山　經中有不少的藥名。</p>
<p>（一）在古代還是神權的時候，好像主宰人間一切的，都是冥冥之中的所謂『神』，所以當時巨衆害病者是求神問卜，仰賴那些不科學化的方藥去治聞疾病；那時可說是神仙方術最盛的時期，也就本草歷史的發剏時期，因爲迷茫之中求來一些所謂治病的本草中，從經騐中慢慢體會出確具實效的藥物　」</p>
<p>神仙方術與本草發生密切關係的人物。如秦始皇；他因爲想保持他的天下由一世以至萬世，聽說扶桑二島有長生不老的仙藥，就妙想天問的派遣徐福携帶三千童男童女，到那兒去採求長生不老的仙方。結果徐福不能求獲仙方，就伴着那些童男童女留在在三島，三島就是現在的日本，所以有人說，現在日本有一部份的人民，是徐福帶出的童男童女的後裔。又如漢武帝的時候：因爲武帝很信仙術，所以當時的神仙方術，盛極一時，但到後來，仙術並不能像各方士所說的那樣靈騐的武帝漸漸窺覺其中有許多不能信任的地方；又恰於該時前後，丞相匡衡上奏，認爲各方士的邪說，全是欺人惑衆，應予取締。神仙方術，至此方日見衰落！</p>
<h3 id="c188">癲癎與偏頭痛 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 月祺</p>
<p>—醫學故事之十—</p>
<p>在某種情狀—這情狀我們只能以「刺戟」一詞形容之—之下，强烈的衝動從神經中樞出發，顯現出相當的徵候來。「癲癎」與「偏頭痛」就是因此造成的最著名的兩種疾病。癲癎是由於運動神經中樞的自發衝動：偏頭風是由於戚覺神經中樞的自發衝動。這兩種疾病頗相近似，我們不妨把偏頭痛稱爲癲癎的感覺式。兩者都是週期的徵候，都是遺傳病，而且都有發作前的預兆。</p>
<p>癲癎的發作，由於運動神經衝動的奔放，患者全身拘　，肌肉收縮非常强烈。有時，在運動區上面的頭部受傷，傷害穿過頭顱骨而使腦表面的細胞結成瘢痕：這也是癲癎的原因。運動區的腫瘍也會造成同樣的結果。這叫做「傑克遜寗癲癎」（Jacksonianepilepsy）—因著名的腦部外科醫生傑克遜（HughlingsJackson）而得名—可藉外科手術療治，　治的方法就是把腫瘍移除。但癲癎的　　　例了都是不可療治的；運動神經細胞並無組織上的變化，就是用顯微鏡也看不到，而週期的拘　竟侵襲患者的大部生命。在發作以前，常有一種預兆，這預兆通知患者：老病又快發作了。預兆的形式，隨時變換，有時眼前現出黑點，有時聽到如鐘鳴一般的聲音，有時眼皮脛攣，有時感到弼烈的情緒興奮。癲癎是一種歷史上著名的疾病，因爲牠常伴着偉大的天才。據傳說，拿破侖和凱撒，都患此症。</p>
<p>偏頭痛是最有趣味的疾病之一。不論男女，不論强弱，都有患此症的；最善自珍攝的醫生，患偏頭痛的也很多。他們不知道那一天他們將受偏頭痛的苦難；他們無法預防，也無從預防。但預兆是有的：有的在前一天感到異常愉快與興奮，他完全知道第二天他一定要受苦了：有的睡眠比平時格外酣適，他醒來時就知道到中午他的老仇人就要到臨了：有的聽到遠處的鐘聲美妙得不同凡響，到了鐘聲沉寂時他的頭痛便發作了。最普通的預兆，是眼前現出有色的曲折光綫，奇怪得很，這光綫只出現於視域的半部。突然的來，也突然的去。腦中有什麼東西啲嗒一聲饗，痛苦完全沒有了。有時，微睡片刻，醒來時那老仇人巳不別而去了。偏頭風也是一種無法療治的疾病，患者只好聽其自止；大概，男子到了中年以後，婦人到了停經以後，週期的偏頭痛罕有不停止的。</p>

<p>（六十九）黃疸lcterusi　jaundice（上）</p>
<p>（問、什麼叫做黃疸？</p>
<p>（答）黃疸，是皮膚和黏膜被膽色素染黃色的疾患的總稱：含有膽色的意味。大都全爲肝膽病患而起的症候。</p>
<p>（問）黃疸病，從原因上分起來講，有那幾種。</p>
<p>（答）有器械的黃疸，卡他兒性黃疸，中毒性黃疸敗血性黃疸，溶血性黃疸　。</p>
<p>（問）器械的黃疸，原因怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）這種黃疸的原因，在乎膽道的狹窄或閉塞。因爲膽汁很容易受着膽逍的阻碍而鬱滯，於是由血管和淋巴管吸收到全身而發黃疸。</p>
<p>（問）阻礙膽道的原因是什麼？</p>
<p>（答）膽道內被阻的原因是膽石，寄生蟲，凝固的血液，或黏液；　膽道壁的阻碍，是膽道發炎腫或瘢痕收縮；在膽道外的是新生物和腫瘍。</p>
<p>（問）器械的黃疸的病狀怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）眼球的結膜先起黃色，其次全身皮膚跟着染黃色，口內的腭黏膜，也起</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>著明的黃染。皮膚發　，分泌物中，像尿，汗，羊水，等都含有膽汁色業；乳汁，咯痰中，吳夜垂夜，黏夜等有時也含有</p>
<p>（問）　　疸病人的　　，；什麼異樣？</p>
<p>（答）　黃疸病人的肝臟腫大，硬度也增加；後來萎縮。往往觸知膽囊的增大。有時見脾　腫人。</p>
<p>（問）　病人的大便，有何變化？</p>
<p>（答）　大便變爲灰白色，秘結，放不快的臭氣。這是因爲膽色素缺乏和脂肪吸收障碍之故、</p>
<p>（問）　器械的黃疸病人的舌苔，食慾和體溫等有什麼異狀？</p>
<p>（答）舌被厚苔，食慾不振。體溫往往比常人爲低；脈搏數又减少。</p>
<p>（問）　還有什麼病狀？</p>
<p>（答）　間有發黃視症，夜盲症：畫盲症等此外體　减耗，皮膚組黏膜出血。（像衂血瀉血或吐血）</p>
<p>（問）　器械的黃疸病，預後吉兇　何？</p>
<p>（答）　關乎原病的狀况血不一定。若黃疸的持續，經過三個月以上的，大概是兇險的。因為能使身體發生膽血症，神經症狀，擔妄和　　昏睡等危險。</p>
<p>（問）　器械的黃疸，應該怎樣治療？</p>
<p>（答）　第一要行原因療法。第二是食　。就是每天吃半流動性的食物，忌脂肪，香料和酒類。多吃澱粉和糖類。蛋白質食物也得稍加限制。第三，藥劑；用硫酸鎂，人工泉鹽，甘汞，等。皮膚發　時，消布　荷酒精，柳酸酒精等：或內服溴素劑，阿托品等。</p>

<p>（六十五慢性結膜炎）</p>
<p>慢性結膜炎的原因。有多種多樣細別之，可以分爲七條。卽（一）急性結膜炎有得全治時。（二）因生活狀况的關係。如時常接　塵埃和烟煤。或夜間缺少睡眠。或常遭風雨。（三）因職業的關係。如常近火燄工作的火夫及鍜冶工人。（四）居住不良空氣的密室中，人衆集合的地方，及缺少新鮮空氣血多烟塵的時候（若戲院，旅館，理髮店，咖啡館，跳舞場，學梭寄宿舍，公共汽車，火車，電車，工塲等等）。（五）患亂視及遠視時。（六）一般入了黑籍的同胞。終日橫臥烟塌。悶居斗室。既多烟霧。又乏新鮮空氣。（七）由局部的原因而引起的。像異物，霰粒腫，睫毛倒生，眼臉濕疹，眼臉　炎，邁朋氏腺栓塞，淚點外翻，淚道狹窄，及淚囊炎等。凡此七條均足引起慢性結膜炎講到牠所發生的症候。是要比急性結胰炎的症候輕得多。普通眼臉結膜也來充血。結膜一般混濁肥厚。乳頭增大。結膜而毫不滑澤。變爲粗糙。分泌物雖少。但每天早晨眼臉　緣常可粘著。有時在臉緣可以察見石鹼樣的泡沫。有時與淚液混合而爲乳劑樣。臉綠往往發赤。外觀好似泣哭。眼角的附近。有時且可發生表皮剝落，裂傷，龜裂等等。</p>
<p>本病患者，在輕症的時候。雖可不覺什麼痛苦。但是大都感覺眼臉發重。開眼運動容易疲勞。所以患者兩眼，常似神疲力倦要睡的樣兒。此外灼熱，癢痛，羞明，瞬目頻作，眼內乾燥，以及眼臉粘著眼球感覺等等。亦爲常發的症候。　等症候，普通由早至晚。漸次增劇。所以患者工作不久。卽覺疲勞。</p>
<p>本病的治療法。首宜注重眼睛的衛生。節制眼的使用。戴用有色的眼鏡。以避光綫刺戟。或用保護眼鏡。以防烟塵的侵入。同時改良或革除上面所述各條的原因。醫如（一）若有急性結膜炎。應卽治療。免致轉爲本病。（二）須改良生活狀况。（三）這時職業的問題。（四）改良換氣裝獨。（五）矯正眼睛的屈折異常。（六）戒絕嗜好。既可護眼。又可增壽。（七）醫治　成局郎原因的疾病。</p>
<h3 id="c191">牙齒常識問答（三） <a href="#c191" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e191" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">191</a></h3>
<p>— 林鑑賢</p>
<p>（第十一問）我國人爲什麼食時多不肯慢嚼，喜歡速食，這個習慣，應該矯正嗎？</p>
<p>（答）我國人因爲不曉得口消化的重要，所以不肯多嚼；放着現成的牙齒不用，埋沒牠天然的功能。有的人還要用湯來淘飯，可以二三口半吞半喝的吃完。評多吃下去的東西，在胃腸來不及消化，就被排洩出去。吃了一倍的東西，只得了半倍的滋養，很不值得。許多人每食吃得很多，但是不會長肉，就是這個緣故。而且因爲口消化不充分，胃腸就要增加担負。日久過勞，還得發生消化不良及其他胃腸病，弄得面黃飢瘦，受害不淺。所以要講求衛生，非得把速食的惡習慣改革不可。每食總須慢慢細嚼。有的醫家竟主張一口飯至少要嚼六十次，直至嚼無可嚼方休。我希望大家卽使不能照辦，也須注意養成細嚼的好習慣。確是有益健康的。</p>
<p>（第十二問）胃腸薄弱的人，食時應當怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）（一）應當細嚼。（二）不可用湯或茶淘飯，因爲淘湯能减少唾液的分泌和咀嚼的次數。（三）不必專揀鷄蛋牛奶等柔軟食品。就是乾硬粗糙的食品如花生米硬壳果實等，若能嚼得細爛，食不過量，也是很易消化很有滋補的。因爲養成這些好習慣而愈胃腸病的，或是身體轉弱爲强的，確是很多。</p>
<p>第二節牙齒其他的功用</p>
<p>（第十二問）牙齒在發音上有什麼功用？</p>
<p>（答）牙齒可以輔助舌部，使得說話流利，發音正確。如果門牙失落，講話就要漏風，很覺不便。</p>
<p>（第十四）牙齒和容貌有什麼關係？</p>
<p>（答）有間接和直接的兩種關係：間接的就是牙齒用來支持唇頰肌肉，使得面部端正。如果靑年時牙齒失落，唇頰肌肉就要縮入，面孔就要像老大婆了！直接的關係，就是整潔的牙齒，可以增加美觀。「明胖皓齒」，誰不羨愛呢！若是滿口牙齒，污穢不齊，人家望而生厭；就要退避一舍」了，！所以牙齒於社交上很有密切的關係。</p>
<p>第二章　牙齒的生長</p>
<p>第一節　乳牙的生長和替換</p>
<p>（第十五問）人的一生，能够長幾副牙齒？</p>
<p>（答）兩副：第一副是乳牙　：第二副是永久牙。</p>
<p>（第十六問）乳牙是幾歲生的？</p>
<p>（答）大約小孩生後半歲至三歲之間陸陸續續生的。</p>
<p>（第十七間）乳牙共有幾只？牠們生畏的稈序怎樣？</p>
<p>（答）共有二十只。最先出的是中間門牙，大約小孩至六七個月就生了。第二是側門牙，大約八至十個月生的。第三是前臼牙，大約十至十六個月生的。第四是犬牙，大約十六至二十個月生的。第五是後臼牙，大約二十至三十個月生的。這五種牙齒，上下左右四邊牙牀都有一只，所以共有二十只。</p>

<p>— 李興</p>
<p>麻醉藥</p>
<p>麻醉品以嗎啡，鴉片，海羅因，科第印等爲最要者，其中嗎啡更佔第一要緊位置，可作爲麻醉的代表。茲詳述於下：</p>
<p>嗎啡</p>
<p>嗎啡的化學成分爲O17H19NO3卽炭十七分子，輕氣十九分子，淡氣一分子，養氣二分子，嗎啡也是鴉片中的一重要成分。乾鴉片約含嗎啡白分之九。嗎啡是白細粉或白細晶體，容易化於水中，味苦，無氣味，</p>
<p>嗎啡在身內的重要作用就是麻醉腦筋（大腦）。在實試室中試騐嗎啡對於蛙的作用，其結果爲中嗎啡毒的蛙動作與割去大腦的哇動作相同，用於別種動物與人身其作用也略同。故嗎啡之最大作用爲麻醉知覺。查我人之疼痛知覺完全位於大腦當中。大腦一被麻木則疼痛威覺與普通感覺均喪失。現在比方割掉一手指疼痛很是厲害。其作用爲受霧處有刺激傳到大腦司痛覺處，受傷者才覺到痛。若是大腦深深的被麻醉了不但是割掉一手指不曉得痛就是割掉一隻手或一一隻脚也不會曉得痛。須知割掉手或割掉脚覺到痛或覺不到痛身體受傷總是一樣，並不是麻木了不知痛就算是沒有受傷。嗎啡除麻醉痛覺外也麻醉其餘知覺，並且也是强有力的催眠劑。有癮的在注射嗎啡後似覺到奮興，其實仍是麻醉作用，也就是嗎啡的欺騙作用。現在比方一個人因精神上的痛苦終日憂悶，寢食俱廢，萬分難過，但一旦因憂悶過度而成瘋病，則一變常態，憂悶全消，狂呼狂笑狀似大喜，一切痛苦再也不知。嗎啡之奮興作用也是類乎此。</p>
<p>嗎啡對於呼吸系有阻滯作用。少量嗎啡　呼吸細弱，大量嗎啡　呼吸停滯身死。少量嗎啡對於血流無甚妨礙，大量嗎啡减低血壓危害生命。</p>
<p>嗎啡對於消化道也有很重要的作用。其最要者爲閉結作用。可以講有嗎啡或鴉片癮的都有些閉結，癮越大閉結也越壞。癮資格老的一兩星期大便一次的也不稀奇。嗎啡類致閉結的方法是：（一）嗎啡使胃內括約肌緊縮致食物由胃入小腸　慢，所以腸少受激刺而少起蠕動作用。（二）嗎啡類麻木肛門部的感應作用。不受麻木的肛部有種感應作用，卽大腸內積有糞時就起緊急大便的感覺，就必須去大便。被麻木的肛部失落了這種感應（由於大腦受麻醉）所以大便可以任意　延多日。（三）减少大小腸的蠕動作用。這是最大的原因。消化時與消後剩下的渣滓須籍大小腸蠕動而向下行。蠕動作用减少糞向下行動也遲滯，卽成大便閉結。有老癮的既長時間閉結，身內各部分也都充滿了毒質（烟毒與身內廢料毒質）自然是天然聽明及本性都喪失凈盡，那裏還去講什麼禮義廉恥！試問有毒癮的那一個發明過一件束西，他們除下坑害自己家裏的人與自己的同胞，他們那還會曉得做有益於社會國家的事。多半不是他們的天性不好，不過是烟毒的作用。</p>
<p>嗎啡的正當用處與不正當的用處</p>
<p>嗎啡的大用處是短時間臨時止厲害的痛，但　用得其當。須由正式醫師管理使用，隨隨便便使用是有害的。茲舉出正當使用之例。比方一個人經用外科手術將爛腿鋸掉。他在鋸後兩三日內實在是非常疼痛。若是這幾日內每日給他注射少許嗎啡麻醉他的腦筋，也就可覺小到痛苦，等數日後疼痛過去嗎啡就可不用。這不過是一種麻醉作用至於身體受的傷還是一樣。用之於短時問劇烈疼痛　算是人類的救星。再比如，一個患毒瘤的到了末期終日疼痛，並且醫師證明生命完全沒有希望，麻醉用於他身使他生活期間痛苦减少也是人道所許的。例如，從前有一位病人患毒瘤在喉部下，到了末期阻礙呼吸，這一位悶了幾天才死去。麻醉他的神經使他不知不覺自然死去較比沒有麻醉品活活悶死好的多了。這都是麻醉品的正當用途。</p>
<p>一切長久的痛是不敢用嗎啡，例如，骨節痛，胃痛，心痛等不可用。嗎啡麻木腦筋不過是幾個小時之久，麻木性過去了又要覺到痛。注意，用嗎啡鴉片治這些病是自己欺騙自己，嗎啡除了麻醉作用外不能治好一種病。若是痛了就用，雖短時間覺到不痛，但因病還在身上，久之於不知不覺當中就緊緊的被麻醉品捆綁了，想不用也不可以了。鴉片作用亦與嗎啡相同。各種慢性痛都有別種無害的治法，患者千萬不要上麻醉品的當。</p>
<h3 id="c193">肺結核淺說（六八） <a href="#c193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>第十二章　肺結核之治療</p>
<p>第一節　天然治療</p>
<p>這是一種很重要的治療法！每一個患者都應該嚴密遵守的：其問首屈一指值得大書特書的，自非「新鮮空氣」而莫屬了！我們曉得，人們之需要空氣，比較任何東西都來得要緊。食物之於人生，總算是藉以維持生命的了，但假使一二天不時食，總還不至危及生命；空氣則大大的不同了，他是一刻兒都離不了的。對於本症患者，他係有促進新陳代謝，調節體溫，增加生理的防禦機能的；間接一方面，與凡本症的一般症象，也因之而可减輕或减除的。所以肺結核患者之宜呼吸新鮮空氣，有時候比較延醫服藥遠來得重要；至於對症的藥物療法，那更加不用提了！就是在事實上，單獨靠此種空氣聞法而致痊愈的例證，臨床上也是數見不鮮的；並且還是大部分。這一種不磨的成績，在初期的本症患者尤為明顯，差不多其他的一切治療方法，都可完全捨棄不用的，這一種看似平淡無奇，其實是有益非淺的治聞法；希望患本症的人們，都要記牢綫好。</p>
<p>空氣療法的實行，除人烟稠密之大都市　有問題外，差不多是沒有再比較簡易的了：祇須患者不絕停留於新鮮空氣中，以少　　，多日光照射之處所爲最宜。對於寒冷之能使症象惡化一層，決不至如一般人所料之甚，患者大可不必過分顧慮的。此外，空氣和氣候係不無關係的，在北方氣候寒冷，乾燦，平時少日光，多霜霧：患者因之而咳嗽　劇，易　感冒，體溫增高。南方氣候炎熱，日光照射過烈，寒熟調節不勻：則患者更者易發生心藏衰弱，食慾減退等現象。氣候之佳良與否，實爲治療本症患者重要條件之一。所以轉地療養一層，對於本症患者，有時也現很大之成效的。</p>

<h3 id="c194">閒話「演劇助賑」 <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 旅岡</p>
<p>爲了救濟一般被罹的災民，海上的人士就發起了什麼義賑會，勸太家搜搜腰包來作這一趟，拯救我們的同胞的「義舉」自然，此舉是誰都樂意去協助的，正所謂「人非草木，孰能無情？」只可惜的是：這幾年來受了經濟恐慌的影響，許多人都相繼破產了。窮人呢？是心有餘而力不足，顧自己的西餐尙恐不飽，何况還惠及他人？至於豐衣足食的人們，卻又好象相隔了天堂與地獄，充耳不聞者頗不乏其人。自然，肯慷慨解囊，扷一毛以濟羣黎者也未嘗沒有。但是，以這末重大的災情，當非小欵所能濟事的，所謂「杯水車薪，」那又有什麽用？</p>
<p>所以，有人在慷慨解囊之外，復倡以什麽「花選助賑」以及「演劇助賑」之類，這自然比之勸人募損更來得容易普遍些。何况用時是「旣享樂，又賑災」，大家尙何樂而不爲？</p>
<p>不過，我們旣非「採花蜂」，「花選」根本就與我們無緣，那當然只是大亨們玩之的把戲吧了。然而，演劇可就不同，卽算不是爲賑濟，我們平時也總得看戲的，而且看戲也不一定就是爲了享樂。我們旣不否認戲劇有敎育大衆的意義，那末，戲劇至少於我們的生活總有多少影響。現在旣要「演劇助賬，」它也總比之「花選」之類來得「名正言順」，「冠冕堂皇」一些。但是，只可情名義上雖然是「演劇賑災」，而劇的內容卻半點「災」情也沒有。那就未免太看重「賑」，而忽略「災」了，因爲：觀衆看後依然是毫無所感的，原因就是他們和尋常的看戲並沒有兩樣。</p>
<p>我以爲：如果「演劇賑災」，能够把災情眞實地在戲劇上反映出來，那纔使大家得到一點兒實惠，不然，受賑的災民也就不免太寃枉，因爲到底沒人能够眞切地知道他們在過着怎樣苦痛的生活啊！年前的水災在電影上曾有過「狂流」一片的出現，在戲劇上也有一部脚本「洪水」，而今年卻什麽也沒有，四顧茫茫，不禁爲之惻然！</p>
<h3 id="c195">孤零的歌 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 里昂</p>
<p>我厭棄了人，還不知是我被人們所厭　了？多少日子來我愛好和孤零親近，一隻雁子似的，一邊飛，一邊叫，下界是一片寒凉的流水，那麽無情地，載不了憂愁的啁啾，憂愁的歌，但偶爾從故創處落下一支羽毛，就會被水浪擁推而轉輾捲進了幽深不可測的漩渦。那裏是平沙呵？那裏的平沙上沒張着捕雁者的大網？倦了，倦了，可是，那裏是休止的地方呢？</p>
<p>也吧，我就在這險峻的崖嶺上息一息，我不再求平沙，每天我都有一個銀色的夜，千萬顆飄浮着的星，幾朶遊倦了的淡黃的雲亦停着不流了，柔軟的露霧滋潤着在成熟期中的山菓，自然的胸懷容忍了我的孤零，自然是不寂寞的，自然是不空虛的，讓我孤零吧，讓我孤零吧。我放棄了名利，我放棄了浮沉於聲色中的夥伴，我抱着明月哈哈大笑，貓頭鷹亦不作夜泣。</p>
<p>孤零並不壞，孤零並不壞，這一片天地，這些樹木，這些綠草，這些熟紅了的果實…都好像是我的，沒有人跟我爭奪，沒有對我斜睨，滿含仇意的眼；沒有粗大的鼻息，覺得那樣寬鬆地，我像超出了平常的自己，到了另一個世界裏。這世界雖同樣沒有平坦廣闊的路，可是只有我一個人幽閒地踱着。在這寂寥的片夜，什麽都可以想，什麼都可以不想，人羣中一定要做的虛僞的事，一定要說的虛僞的話，一定要扮的虛僞的顏面，現在我都可以置之不理。甚麼牽絆，甚麽眩耀，甚麽誘感，甚麽暗箭，甚麽欺詐…都沒有，全身都充溢了自由的愉快戚，在人羣中不易享受到的自由，我在孤零中獲得了，我儘量地享受，享受這無涯的自然的賜興，自然决不像人羣那樣嗇吝而薄倖。</p>
<p>莫問我，誰也莫問我，我的心神早被累倒了，讓我安寗一回吧，讓我在紫色的零圍裏溫一回春風似的柔和的夢。呵，朋友，請你莫再來纏擾我了，請你莫再把冰冷的面孔和炙熱的手來掇撫我了，這種炎凉的刺激我受不了，受不了！讓我少看見幾慕在生活磨子下的慘劇，少看見幾個孤兒寡婦抖顫的身影，泥潭裏的痙擊者，瘋人哨着病榻的情形，讓我的心跳暫且靜止一回，心房中的血液循環暫且獲得和諧。莫笑我，誰也英笑我，我並非畏懼現實而圖脫逃，現實誰也脫逃不了的，可是，我倦了，倦了，我需要息一息呵。</p>
<p>這一片無涯的空曠，這一片無涯的夜色，我迸住氣息，從靜默中，領悟了</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>宇宙永恒的定律，人生悠久的潛藏着的夢幻。一切崖嶺上是寂然，只有樹杪上喳喳未眠的衆鳥在吸取目然界的新鮮的滋營，是何等溫和，何等的好。我願做一支草在寒澗裏搖，一片雲在太空裏繼，或生了翅翼投進一羣小烏，人羣的偉大和高超我全不要，每夜，每夜，浴　寒凉的月光而歌唱……</p>

<p>— 修斯</p>
<p>深夜獨坐，秋聲滿樓，初還聽了便煩燥，久之却引爲快樂。</p>
<p>隣家的孩子不知怎麼不小心，他的蟋蟀跑到我的房裏大叫特叫，放下工作到處找尋，原來是在窗口。本心是要找蟋蟀的，一見了牠却不想捉牠，亦不想趕牠走，靜心地在聽牠臨風懸鳴，就好像在聽着一位大音樂家的引吭高歌。不料牠不是我在找尋的那一個蟋蟀，房裏又有叫聲響起來，正如兩個大音樂家在一唱一和。聽了牠們的唱和，一個是唱高音階的，一個是唱低中音的，倒亦和諧，忘形的我完全沈醉在牠們的歌聲裏去了。</p>
<p>有人以靑蛙爲春的詩人，我想蟋蟀才是秋的音樂家。春的詩人，對我沒有好感。不是麽？在池潭裏是那麽噪雜地單調地嘓嘓嘓，吟詩亦應該講究一點音韻節奏才算是吟詩的吧，老是那麼嘓嘓嘓地吟，不是乏味的詩麽？我不是詩人尙且聽了不高興，你想，眞正的詩人那要甘心承願靑蛙是詩人呢？</p>
<p>靑蛙眞不及蟋蟀萬倍，除了嘓啯嘓地在噪鬧之外，什麽本領亦沒有。蟋蟀呢？，牠會唱歌，還會戰鬥，頗像浪漫主義時代的英雄，所謂騎土亦像。拜倫不就是一個能够戰鬥的詩人麽？不過，蟋蟀會戰鬥，雖然是古今有名的，是不是會爲國爲民地戰鬥，那就未見書上有載。想來蟋蟀的會戰鬥，那是生物的求生存的本能，在牠們的生長之地，或者亦是有家族民族國族與民族的分別，因之亦時不時有爲自衛而抵抗强暴者的壓迫的集團戰爭，如爲國爲民之類，不像被人們養在瓦盆裏只會作個人主義的莫名其妙的英雄吧。</p>
<p>蟋蟀會唱歌，又會戰鬥，我愛蟋蟀。</p>
<p>因談蟋蟀想起螞蟻。螞蟻不是此較蟋蟀更加可愛的麽？牠們雖然並非詩人，亦不會唱歌，可是牠們能耐勞，吃苦，探險，戰鬥，而且是集團戰鬥，正是人的好模範吧。如今是秋天了，螞蟻爲了儲藏嚴冬的食糧，正是最忙最忙的時期。夏天的蟲類如蟬，雖然在時至運至那當兒，趾高氣揚地在快樂的歌快樂的唱一到夏去秋來禁不住寒風的壓迫，老早將自己的嘴巴封住，能够在秋風裏奮鬥着引吭高歌的蟋蟀，看來似乎比較夏蟬足以自傲，然而，秋去冬來的時候，蟋蟀不是亦要消聲匿跡不知所終的麽？只有螞蟻，牠們從春到夏是享福時期，從秋到冬是忙碌與蟄伏時期一年四季都快樂着健康着，牠們並不驕傲，也不悲傷，爲生活而享福，爲生活而奮鬥，爲生活而生活，正是牠們的「人生觀」吧？不過，螞蟻的壽命不知有多少畏短，我愛牠們，工想起　，倒很願意請敎昆蟲學家去。</p>
<p>秋天的螞蟻忙於儲藏嚴冬時期的食糧，因此時常外出探險，雖然牠們並不是秋蟲之類，但亦於秋天時常出現於人們的眼底，我早上就看見了一個螞蟻正在我的一包白糖上逡巡。我想牠一回去報吿，傾國而來，一包白糖不就將要完了麽？正如戰場中殺死一個敵方的探子一樣，拘禁不如殺死爲妙，便用指頭將牠活活地理到糖要去了。現在想起牠的「人格」，有如做了一椿虧心事。</p>
<h3 id="c197">夜半夢回 <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 摩加</p>
<p>望着那屋子外的綠葉越枯黃的多而快，每當走出去，已經零亂地舖滿一地，年老的門丁又增加一番淸掃的事情。我意識着秋意是逐漸濃厚冲不開了。對於花的飄落，葉的飄落，似乎是大自然早便爲之安排定的，莫可挽回的運命。在我也着實缺少一種優雅的興緻來讚嘆他們的不幸，至於因此而引起什麽無限感喟或閒愁；更是不會有的。爲了在自已迫忙的日子中，根本就騰不出一份時間，以花化給傷春悲秋的太息。可是新近却不知怎的，彷彿有一種沒着落的空虛感這縱着我，隨時隨地親近着我，這空虛而且狠迅速在磅礴起來，已經到了成爲有份量似的的東西擱在肩胛上邊，緩緩地感得有些沉動了。於是我時常做着奇異的夢，夢見自己原來是一支流在茫茫大海裏的萍藻；夢見自己是一隻停在半空的風裏無着無靠的斷綫紙鳶，又夢見是迷失了路躑躅於黑黝黝的深夜原野中，後面且隱約聞着又怕的叫嗥，一　悸，往往就這樣醒轉來了。有月的時候，幽輝照着牀頭，我摸着額頂還沁着冷冷的汗珠。尋味夢中的經過依稀可數，再加仔細投閱，卻已模糊了。</p>
<p>有好幾夜連續這樣，醒後則不易入睡了。躺着，聽街間錯落的夜食叫賣者的嗓子，或是一陣風似的馳過去的汽車的尾音，我忽然有兩種完全不同的感觸：叫賣者的嗓子我每天都能够溫習到，對於那嘆息似的嗓子我是聽得爛熟了，可是每一回當給我聽到的時候，我總欲想起一個荷着生之擔子的增子人，伴養自家孤獨的影子走過冷落的街，冷落的巷，以及冷落的　衕，另後送長夜深下去。他是載着重重的擔子，和無人過問的重重的悲苦啊！也許在我的冥思尤未結束的當兒，一陣嘹曉的汽車的喇叭又奔過去了，我知道奔過去的汽車，却載着一些夜遊者的淫情與歡樂。等聲音遠去的時候，低微的叫賣者的嗓子復淸晰地浮蕩起來，在寂寞的夜心，兩種聲韻混合了。不久沉下去，不久又展散上來。</p>
<p>在我夢後，心靈已經異樣的空洞，現在更加感到格外脆弱，好像眼淚也差點從眼眶裏擠出來。我完全不知道是爲了什麽綠故，聽到一陣較尖利的叫喚聲，我的心便不由地綳緊着，接着卜通地跳個不休，而尤其是靜寂的夜間，才受到遠逆的夢情所襲擊，又聞着外面凄凉的叫聲，眼淚眞的是簌簌地一串串淌下。</p>
<h3 id="c198">鳳仙 <a href="#c198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— 華之</p>
<p>看見都市女子指甲上塗着殷紅的寇丹，我想起故鄉的鳳仙花來。先父是喜歡種竹養魚的，那些他到處覓收悉心繁殖的金魚，在他過世後沒有兩個月，經過一個大雪的冬天，因爲在喪里，就沒有人注意到他的愛魚，魚缸通底結了冰，金魚都像冰凍地力糕似的肚皮向天凝結在晶瑩的冰塊中，殉葬了。金魚共有百來尾，分門別類分貯三大缸，父親在時，他每天的大部分時間是消費在牠們身上。有一尾特別碩大，左邊的一顆眼珠像一顆透明的珠子，是朝天龍的變種，他說全城祇有他一條，時常招許多朋友到家里來參觀他的魚種以爲榮的。可是他撤手歸天之後，一百多尾的金魚，全城惟一的獨眼龍，儘數死了，這或許在父親意料之外的。然而那個花院到現在芟草沒脛的樣子，更是意料不及的。那花院就在父親臥室的前面，種着四季不絕的花草。對於花草，他有不同的見解，他說養金魚要以希爲貴，花卉却以蕪雜爲主，卽使是草，祇要牠能出美麗的花朵，父親同樣培植牠。所以花院中有不少種花是他杜撰一個名字以竹籤標了，和高貴的牡丹劍蘭一視同仁。朋友來參觀他的金魚的自然也到花院里去走走，見他那樣「拉來籃里就是菜」的種花，引起他們的反對，但是不能改變父親的偏見。曾記得朋友們取笑父親，說養魚的態度，像聖潔的處女，在花院里却做起賣淫婦來了。這譬喩是很確實的。父親的回答是賣淫婦有不同於處女的風情，這是別的種花人所不能領略的；這是父親的獨到之處。</p>
<p>花院的面積很小，除了中間有一條石砌的行人道，兩旁整齊地放着盆花，其外的就隨心所欲地播種了。因爲父親種花的見解如此，祇要花院里所沒有的，他很感謝朋友們的賜與，於是那小小的花院中像一個蒔花展覽會一樣，各式花等，一應俱全。但是那時候沒有種鳳汕花，直到一位朋友開玩笑送來一包鳳仙子，父親不問所以悉數澈在花院里，開出來却是鳳仙花。所奇怪的是鳳仙亦變了種，有幾株開了紫羅蘭似的花朶，這使他寶貴起來，說是我家花院特有的名花了；美其名曰「羅蘭鳳」，是合鳳仙與紫羅蘭而有之的意思。可是這花的繁殖本領特別大，每一株花可以結上像橄欖大的無數子實，每一顆子實中孕着無數種子，並且不必經人工，到時候橄欖</p>

<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>形的子實綻了，到明年就是無數的鳳仙花。到第三年鳳仙幾乎要侵略全個花院之勢，父親不能領略那種特有的「風情」了，在牠剛開花的時候，幾乎拔去了十之七，姊妹們大家搗牠的花汁來染指甲。以後每年要留心着在牠結子之前扷去，否則明年就是滿院子的鳳仙。</p>
<p>父親故世後，這花院沒有一個管理的人，然而鳳仙突然少了下來，第二年竟絕了跡。母親說父親生前的愛物都殉葬了，言下不勝感慨。</p>
<p>現在花院里芟草沒脛，無人過問，想着搗鳳仙花汁染指甲的繁榮境况，能不淚下？</p>

<p>並非爲搶生意，王先生如果批購「美鹽的意識」之外還需要別的「意識」，那麼筆者敢以「百分之百」的「嚴肅的坦白的，客觀」向王先生「推薦」：</p>
<p>藝海裏有「意識嚴重」和「意識偉大」出賣，此種「意識一配以一悲星型一的王美玉，實在更配也。</p>
<p>不久之後，一意識必如藥料那麼的，「美鹽的意識」六錢「意識嚴重三分，一意識偉大」五厘。如此，像陳大悲先生那麼的做了一編劇」。</p>
<p>不過，吃藥的中國電影界，不知那時會請醫生請到無常否？</p>
<h3 id="c205">由音響的重要性　談到「暴風雨」的音響 <a href="#c205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— 靑雲</p>
<p>音嚮，它是聲片中必需要的一種助長劇情發展的份子，一部聲片要達到把握住空淸，調子上的完美，音嚮的注重，茶不可以志氣的，反之，劇情發展到高潮的緊張時間，如不運用這適宜「劇情發展到高潮緊張時間一的音嚮，它不單是失去了它應有的效用，目反破壞了原來劇情的緊張性，同樣的，原來的劇情缺乏了緊張性，如果助以適宜完美的音嚮，必然的容易抓件觀衆的情緒。</p>
<p>歐美國家出品　聲片，就明瞭音嚮同聲片的聯系重要性，所以對別聲片的昔嚮非常底注重，但反顧我們中國的聲片呢？多只注重聲片的歌曲，而很多聲片中的歌曲，全與劇情無關，强硬的穿插進去，所謂「注重」，只不過是迎合每片必歌的潮流而已，對於音嚮，是漠然視之。</p>
<p>這是很值得慶幸的，在這聲片每片必歌漢視音嚮的今日，即將公映的　華撮造袁叢美導演的聲片「　風雨一，就是離羣獨異的注重音嚮的效果，而　歌曲，利用完美的音嚮，補助劇情的進展，試演的結果，雖未達到十全十美的境地，然而却也值得誇張的說「暴風雨」的音嚮處理是相當的成功了；至於「暴風兩」沒有歌，倒不是特的因爲注重音嚮，而忽視了歌，完全是劇情不需要的關係了。</p>

<h3 id="e41">Prospects for Two Major Construction Projects in Zhejiang Province <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>— All</p>
<p>— Building the Qiantang River Bridge and Completing the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway —</p>
<p>The urgent completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway is almost a unanimous demand of all people in Zhejiang. To realize this goal, the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge is the prerequisite. For the Hangzhou-Cao'e section, land acquisition and surveying work have long been underway. Even for the Cao'e River Bridge project, there is a foundation to build upon. The only obstacle to the entire design is the Qiantang River. The proposal to build the Qiantang River Bridge dates back twenty years. However, with the sudden outbreak of the European War, the proposal was shelved. Today, with the increasing complexity of transportation networks and the pressing need for bridges, tens of thousands of people cross the river daily, relying solely on charitable ferry services. This is not only time-consuming and inefficient but also prone to danger. Moreover, with the completion of the Zhejiang Railway and the rapid development of highways in eastern Zhejiang, Hangzhou has become a pivotal transportation hub. However, the Qiantang River obstructs the smooth flow of transportation, hindering the overall development. This is not only a regret for the people of Zhejiang. The Zhejiang authorities are aware of the urgency of the situation and the need to act. Therefore, they have resolutely taken on the responsibility, collaborating with the Ministry of Railways to build the Qiantang River Bridge and simultaneously planning the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway. Zhejiang Province has long been known for its commitment to construction projects, and the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway authorities are also known for their dedication. With the cooperation of both parties, the progress of the projects will be easily optimistic. We have expressed our deep expectations from the beginning. The construction of the Qiantang River Bridge has been underway for almost a year, and there is talk of laying tracks for the Hangzhou-Cao'e section by New Year's Day next year. Amidst earnest anticipation, we reiterate three points for the encouragement of those in charge.</p>
<p>Firstly, public construction is closely related to the people's livelihood, and these projects are particularly hoped for by people far and wide. Every move is watched with great attention. Since the work has begun, it should be pursued with full force. However, in these times of economic hardship, we are aware of the difficulty of raising funds. The estimated cost of building the Qiantang River Bridge is 5.5 million. Initially, 2.5 million was to be borrowed from the National Economic Council and the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Committee, and 2 million was to be borrowed from Shanghai banking groups by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. Later, with the Ministry of Railways joining the construction, the two committees temporarily withdrew. The Ministry of Railways then borrowed from a syndicate jointly formed by the Construction Bank Corporation and the China and South Sea Bank. With the funds secured, there should be no worries about financial constraints. We still hope that the authorities will maintain the designated use of the funds and avoid any attempts at misappropriation. Other secondary facilities can be considered based on the situation. For example, building grand structures for aesthetic purposes can be considered if the environment allows. However, if raising funds is difficult, it should be postponed. For public construction projects like these two, there should be no risk of stagnation midway.</p>
<p>Secondly, official documents in our country have always been characterized by circumlocution. Assigning a matter often involves lengthy processes, leading to wasted work efficiency and raising public suspicion. However, the highway construction in various provinces recently has achieved significant results in the shortest possible time, which is a major improvement. It is said that the staff of the Qiantang River Bridge Construction Office are dedicated to their work. Although the project has suffered repeated flooding, making it difficult to complete on schedule, such unexpected setbacks are understandable. Now that the flood season is over, the time and place are right. We sincerely hope that those in charge will make a firm decision and accelerate the progress to witness its early completion, comforting the eager expectations of the people. The railway bureau should also take the lead in track-laying work and expedite progress. Judging from the past achievements of the railway bureau, such as the laying of double tracks on the Shanghai-Xiang line and the design of the city center railway, the work was not significantly delayed. Therefore, we believe that this project will not disappoint us.</p>
<p>Thirdly, our country, lagging behind in science, has always felt the lack of technical talents. The use of talents from other regions has only relied on foreign countries. With the establishment of numerous vocational schools, more talents are gradually being cultivated. However, engineering personnel returning from overseas often prefer to embark on a political career, gradually forgetting their responsibilities. Oranges transplanted north of the Huai River turn into trifoliate oranges, and sparrows entering the water turn into clams. It is a matter of deep regret, not to be further discussed. We believe that there is nothing wrong with engineering personnel entering the political arena. However, considering the importance of their mission, they should think about contributing to society. Using their official positions as a basis for development is acceptable, but making officialdom their sole objective is a mistake. The talents recruited by the Qiantang River Bridge Construction Office are mostly scholars of engineering and graduates of civil engineering departments from various universities. Many have also joined as trainees. During the summer vacation, the Baotou Institute of Technology sends third-year students from the engineering department to intern. This shows that the country is paying great attention to technical capabilities, which is a sign of future development. We hope that all technical personnel will further hone their skills in this difficult project and cultivate a rigorous and disciplined work ethic.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the construction of the Qiantang River Bridge and the completion of the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway are complementary and represent the unanimous hope of the people. The authorities should adopt a firm attitude, eliminate the bad habit of laxity, and strive to achieve their goals regardless of the difficulties encountered. We, though not talented, will watch with anticipation and hope for their success.</p>

<p>(Washington) The world is speculating on what attitude the United States will take if the League of Nations imposes sanctions on Italy.

The official also declined to comment on the five measures proposed yesterday by the Foreign Policy Association for the United States to cooperate with the League of Nations. The five measures are: (1) Recall diplomatic envoys stationed in Italy; (2) Not recognize territories seized by Italy through military force; (3) Prohibit the export of arms and other war supplies; (4) Cooperate with the League of Nations to blockade Italian ports and help isolate Italy economically and financially; (5) US ships may not transport food to Italy via the Suez Canal.

<h3 id="e47">Abyssinian King to Issue Mobilization Order Imminently, Appeals to League of Nations for Effective Measures, Current Situation Extremely Serious, Failure to Mobilize Would Be a Dereliction of Duty to Defend the Country, Committee of Thirteen to Meet Today <a href="#e47" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c47" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">47</a></h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: The Abyssinian King telegraphed the President of the Executive Yuan today, stating that he intends to issue a mobilization order immediately because Italian troops are entering Abyssinia in increasing numbers. Abyssinia cannot delay mobilization any longer. He requested that the League of Nations Executive Yuan take all possible precautionary measures to prevent Italian aggression. The time has come, and failure to mobilize would be a dereliction of duty. However, even if the mobilization order is issued immediately, it will not change the order for Abyssinian troops to retreat 30 kilometers from the border. Abyssinia remains determined to cooperate closely with the Executive Yuan and hopes to achieve a peaceful resolution of the dispute with Italy based on the Covenant. The situation has suddenly deteriorated. Those who previously believed that peace could be maintained now admit that the situation is hopeless. All parties are urging the King to sign and issue a general mobilization order today, but it is doubtful that he will do so immediately. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol received a telegram from the Abyssinian King this morning regarding the issuance of a general mobilization order. He immediately distributed the telegram to all members of the Executive Yuan. The Executive Yuan is expected to meet tomorrow. The League of Nations believes that this development makes it more necessary for the League of Nations to send personnel to Abyssinia to determine responsibility for aggression. (Reuters, 29th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Committee of Thirteen on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute had originally decided to postpone its meeting until Thursday. However, due to the Abyssinian government's issuance of a general mobilization order, the meeting may be brought forward to tomorrow in order to discuss the current situation as soon as possible. League of Nations officials believe that local authorities in Abyssinia have long been mobilizing troops and deploying forces in border areas. Although the issuance of a general mobilization order will not have a significant impact on the overall situation, it cannot be denied that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute has reached its most serious stage. This is because the Italian government may use Abyssinia's general mobilization as an excuse to launch military action immediately. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: A reporter from this agency stated that the upper and middle classes of Abyssinia were very excited to learn that the King had telegraphed the League of Nations, stating that Abyssinia would soon begin general mobilization. Well-informed sources believe that war between Italy and Abyssinia will begin within fifteen days. The Abyssinian general mobilization order will take effect from October 1st. The general public is still unaware of the King's decision to issue a mobilization order. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Le Matin reported from Rome that war in Abyssinia is expected to begin in the middle of next week. The general mobilization exercise of Italian fascist groups, originally scheduled to be held before the 10th, has been repeatedly postponed. Judging from the situation, the day of this general mobilization exercise is likely to be the day before the Italian troops in East Africa are ordered to attack Abyssinia. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>(Rome) It is generally believed that the issuance of a general mobilization order by the Abyssinian government will accelerate the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian war. Several days ago, newspapers reprinted foreign news stating that Abyssinia's general mobilization was inevitable. Now, as expected, the cabinet decided yesterday to issue a warning to the League of Nations, implying that Abyssinia's general mobilization was imminent. As for the Abyssinian Emperor's order for his country's border troops to retreat 30 kilometers, some quarters here have long known that it was a smokescreen intended to conceal military preparations in the interior of the country. (Havas, 29th)</p>
<p>Naples: Upon hearing the news that the Abyssinian government was about to issue a general mobilization order, Italy is accelerating the transportation of troops to East Africa. This afternoon, over 10,000 troops departed from Naples on five troop transport ships. This is the first time that over 10,000 troops have been transported in a single day. At the same time, 70 tanks and artillery vehicles were transported from Bologne to Africa. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>Speculation on Italian Military Strategy</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Observers here have speculated on whether Italian Prime Minister Mussolini can apply modern tactics in the tropical jungles of Abyssinia. General information suggests that Italian troops plan to advance from Eritrea directly south towards Lake Tana to occupy the water source used by Britain to irrigate Egypt and Sudan. It is said that Italian troops are now concentrated in the western end of Eritrea, where the line is 60 miles long bordering Sudan. During the attack, they will advance along the Sudanese border directly to Gondar, which is 20 miles north of Lake Tana. The soil in the Shettona region is now dry and can be mobilized immediately. However, the rainy season in southern Abyssinia has not stopped, and Italian troops are waiting to advance on all fronts simultaneously. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>War Correspondent's Inspection</p>
<p>Abyssinian Border: Miller, the head of the Associated Press European bureau, is currently with the Italian army on the Abyssinian border. Today, he took a flight on a bomber personally piloted by Count Ciano, Mussolini's son-in-law, to inspect the front lines. He saw that the Italian army's front lines were mostly desolate wilderness and towering mountains. The roads at the front were muddy and difficult to travel, and the soldiers arriving from all directions were crowded. (Associated Press Italian Army Correspondent, 28th)</p>
<p>Abyssinian Preparations to Resist the Enemy</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: A reporter from this agency stated that although the rainy season in Abyssinia has passed, the rain has not stopped. This is a rare phenomenon in previous years. The Abyssinian people believe this is a good omen, saying it is "heavenly assistance." Although Abyssinian military operations are greatly inconvenienced and agricultural harvests will suffer significant damage, they are not concerned about this. The government is actively organizing troops. Two generals, Governor Mariam of the Shewa Governorate and General Zimmana of the South Sidamo Province, have been summoned to the capital to train troops. General Siyum, the governor of Tigray Province, which borders Italian Eritrea, has requested the government not to send any more troops to the province due to a shortage of food, saying that the existing garrison is sufficient to deal with everything.

<p>Brussels: According to the "Soir" newspaper here, the Abyssinian government has ordered 1,700 rifles, 2,300 cavalry carbines, and 7 million rounds of ammunition from Belgium, which will be shipped to Abyssinia soon. The price is approximately 3.7 million francs, which has already been paid in advance. (Havas, 28th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Dr. Lambie, an executive of the British and Foreign Bible Society, is originally American, has resided in Abyssinia for 16 years, has obtained Abyssinian citizenship, and is a friend of the Abyssinian Emperor. He recently went to Britain to purchase various medical supplies and poison gas masks. He was recently urgently summoned back here by the Abyssinian Emperor, bringing with him a batch of poison gas masks, which will soon be distributed to ten groups of Red Cross volunteers.

<p>(Rome) Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's communique yesterday, aimed at the League of Nations, stated that Italy continues to have reasons to increase its forces on the Abyssinian border, claiming that the country is taking advantage of the League's delays to prepare for war against Italy, so Italy must continue to move troops there. The communique also outlined Mussolini's foreign policy, which included the following four points: (1) If Italy withdraws from the League of Nations, Italy believes it is the League of Nations' fault; (2) If the League of Nations takes no further hostile action, Italy will not withdraw; (3) Avoid expanding the scope of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute; (4) Italy's demand for the opening up of colonial territories must proceed regardless of world opinion. (National Telegraph, 28th)</p>
<p>(London) According to the Press Association today, without obtaining further details, Italy's recent communique cannot ease the current situation. The communique appears to be based on the erroneous view promoted by Italy that the Abyssinian case is actually a struggle between British and Italian interests in East Africa. However, British cabinet members have repeatedly declared that Britain has no selfish interests in Abyssinia and is acting solely as a member of the League of Nations, in accordance with the dispute with France. Whether Italy intends to negotiate and make military action unnecessary, or intends to negotiate an agreement with Britain on British interests in East Africa after it has become the master of Abyssinia, is still unknown. However, in the current situation, this proposal does not seem to have much value, as the former implies seeking a resolution outside the League of Nations, which the British government is unlikely to approve, and the latter will not avoid war in Abyssinia. (Reuters, 28th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Observers here and in several other European governments initially held a slim hope that Mussolini might be willing to negotiate at the last minute before the League of Nations Executive Council decides to impose sanctions on Italy. However, this hope has been dashed by the recent communique from the Italian government. The communique issued after the Italian cabinet meeting stated: "Italy does not wish to withdraw from the League of Nations until the League of Nations itself assumes full responsibility for taking action against Italy. Italy has notified the British government, informing it that Italy is prepared to negotiate an agreement with Britain in the future that does not harm Britain's legitimate interests in Central Africa." Rome calls this an appeal to Britain to reconsider its attitude towards Italy's legitimate demands and a direct invitation for Britain to participate in bilateral negotiations. These negotiations are likely to take place outside the League of Nations framework, but even the most optimistic observers in Paris do not believe that Britain will be induced to participate in direct negotiations with Rome outside the League of Nations.

Therefore, French Prime Minister Laval may comply with the request of British Chief Representative Eden of the Executive Council and proceed quickly with everything. If so, the Executive Council is likely to reconvene soon. When the French Cabinet meets this week, it will decide on the second step France intends to take. (Reuters, 29th)</p>

<p>(Paris) According to dispatches from Rome, while the Italian authorities do not believe that the League of Nations sanctions will necessarily be implemented, they do not dare to take it lightly. Import duties have now been waived on essential metals such as tungsten and cobalt, chemical elements such as carbon bismuth, and wood needed to make gun stocks. All construction is prohibited from excessive use of steel in order to conserve supplies, and gasoline consumption has been greatly reduced due to the increased price. The Ministry of Agriculture is currently stockpiling 2 million quintals of wheat to provide food to the people in case market prices soar. If the League of Nations implements economic sanctions, Italy will try to trade with non-member countries. It has already ordered a large quantity of meat from Brazil, rather than Argentina, because Brazil is not a member of the League of Nations. Italy also sees Japan and Germany as sources of supply.

<p>Memel: The Memel parliament will hold elections tomorrow. The world's attention has never been greater than this time. Over 100 foreign journalists have arrived here. Diplomatic representatives from Britain, France, Italy, and other countries have arrived from Kovno to monitor the election. The atmosphere is tense on the streets. Lithuanian and German propaganda and advertisements are everywhere. There are 73 polling stations, each with ten ballot boxes. There are approximately 70,000 voters. Voting will begin at 8 am tomorrow and end at 8 pm. Each box can hold 70 votes. Each ballot has 189 items. To vote for the Memel Joint List, 29 items must be torn off, placed in an envelope, sealed, and dropped into the ballot box. All votes will be collected in Memel City on Sunday night.

Now, the replacement of local police with Lithuanian police to maintain public order on election day is a clear violation of Memel law.

<p>(Berlin) German newspapers are severely criticizing the note sent by the signatory countries of the Memel Statute to the German Foreign Office, arguing that Lithuania's declaration does not align with the German perspective and the truth. The official newspaper of the National Socialist Party even claims that Lithuania now has the backing of Soviet Russia, hence its terrorist activities in Memel continue to increase. (28th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) Today, public sentiment here regarding the Memel elections remains highly agitated. Although the guarantees obtained by Britain, France, and Italy to ensure fair elections, pending German steps, have generally satisfied Germany, semi-official circles are not yet reassured by the statement in the three countries' communication that all matters have been properly addressed. They also find it strange that the three countries apparently accept the Lithuanian government's guarantee that the voting will be conducted fairly. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>Memel: According to German sources, despite repeated assurances from the Lithuanian government to various countries that the upcoming parliamentary re-election in the Memel region would be conducted fairly, there are still signs of manipulation in various locations. It is reported that as of April 1st, 5,238 Lithuanians had changed their residency to Memel, and since April 1st, another 5,000 people are expected to do so. Meanwhile, 69 Memel leaders have been deprived of their citizenship, and as many as 14,800 people are ineligible to vote due to non-compliance with regulations. (29th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Berlin) A semi-official political diplomatic correspondence recently published an article on the Memel issue, stating that tomorrow (September 29th) is the day of elections in the Memel region. The people of Memel have struggled to defend their long-guaranteed rights, and the outcome will depend on tomorrow's election. Therefore, tomorrow's election is of utmost importance. Britain, France, and Italy, the three countries guaranteeing the autonomy of the Memel region, are satisfied with the Lithuanian government's promises and believe that they have fulfilled their obligation to protect Memel's autonomy. However, the validity of these promises by the Lithuanian government will be judged by the September 29th election. In short, the task undertaken by Britain, France, and Italy is not to arbitrate disputes between Germany and Lithuania. In reality, there is no so-called dispute between Germany and Lithuania. However, Germany cannot stand idly by as Lithuania unilaterally undermines the autonomous system of Memel guaranteed by the great powers and disregards the people's rights guaranteed by the Memel autonomous constitution. Furthermore, the letter from Britain, France, and Italy to the Council of the League of Nations, advocating for the cessation of disturbances in the Memel region and the improvement of relations between Lithuania and Germany, should be directed at Lithuania, not Germany. If Lithuania faithfully fulfills its obligations, the disturbances in the Memel region will naturally cease, and relations between Germany and Lithuania can be expected to improve. "The Berliner Börsen-Zeitung" published a dispatch from its correspondent in Memel, stating, "Tomorrow's election is not just an election; it is a plebiscite for German citizens. All necessary consequences will be immediately apparent after the election." This statement is particularly noteworthy. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>

It was only after news of Ribbentrop's appearance in Brussels reached London and Paris that the authorities officially announced the matter. Ribbentrop's trip lasted only twelve hours, so it must have been more than just an inquiry; some agreement must have been reached beforehand. Meanwhile, Hungarian Prime Minister Gömbös, after hunting with Göring in East Prussia, arrived here by plane at 6 p.m. yesterday.

<p>(Tokyo) Britain has advocated convening a formal naval disarmament conference, and the Japanese Navy has stated its position on this matter as follows:</p>
<p>Naval disarmament negotiations have had a rather complex history to date. Therefore, Britain is unlikely to suddenly convene a formal conference now, as the situation is not that simple. In short, it is not appropriate to discuss the contents of the British proposal before they have been examined. However, the Japanese Navy feels it is necessary to understand in detail the British intentions and attitude in dealing with this issue. If these key points are not clear, it will be difficult to proceed. If it is in line with Japan's demands, that would be fortunate; if not, it will not be easy to simply decide on an attitude. "The Ministry of Foreign Affairs is also taking a cautious attitude towards this case, as follows:</p>
<p>Regarding the issue of convening a formal naval conference, we have not yet received any official telegrams, so it is not appropriate to comment. We will carefully review the contents of Acting Ambassador Fujii's report and then consult with the Navy to decide on our attitude. At present, we only know that invitations to convene a formal conference have been issued, but the content is still unknown, so it is not appropriate to discuss whether to agree.

The delay is too long, and the naval strength maintained by the US is therefore not suitable for the national situation. Although the government has repeatedly stated that the US should be first among the world's naval powers, this is not actually the case. However, despite these complaints, shipyards are now stepping up shipbuilding work. Some shipyards that had been shut down for some time have reopened due to the government's active shipbuilding program. The cost involved is not small. (28th Havas Telegram)</p>

<p>Rome Correspondence: The conflict between Italy and Abyssinia has become increasingly tense recently. This newspaper has been constantly publishing reports on the state of military preparedness on both sides. The reason for the conflict, as well as the pretext invoked by Italy, is the "Walwal Incident." From the emergence of the dispute to mediation efforts, to the proposal of arbitration, it has thus far failed to be resolved, becoming a prelude to the Italo-Abyssinian military buildup. Even if Italy has other ambitions to occupy the entirety of Abyssinia, (as the reporter described in detail in a dispatch sent to this newspaper on July 19th), the so-called "Walwal Incident" is merely an excuse for its military actions. However, this incident ultimately remains the flashpoint of the Italo-Abyssinian war, possessing historical value. By studying the beginning and end of this incident, one can also glimpse Italy's specific objectives in Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Walwal is located at the border between southeastern Abyssinia in Africa and northeastern Italian Somaliland. Twelve days before the incident (December 5th of last year), the Anglo-Abyssinian Boundary Demarcation Committee convened in Walwal (i.e., November 23rd of last year) to discuss the dispute between British Somaliland and the Ogaden region of Abyssinia. The natives of British Somaliland, seeking water and grazing land, often moved to the Ogaden region of Abyssinia to obtain springs and pastures, which had been the case for many years and was officially recognized by the supplementary agreement of May 1897. However, there were occasional conflicts between the two tribes, which were difficult to mediate. In order to implement the 1897 treaty and determine the boundaries between the two sides to prevent disputes, the Anglo-Abyssinian Joint Committee was established and decided to meet in Walwal for discussions. However, when the committee arrived, Italian troops were already stationed there, with fortifications flying the Italian flag. The site of the Anglo-Abyssinian Joint Committee was also frequently reconnoitered by Italian aircraft. At the time, the British side was very angry, but in order to avoid causing a serious dispute, it declared that it would temporarily withdraw to Ado pending negotiations. Therefore, when the conflict between Italy and Abyssinia occurred on December 5th, there were no third parties present to witness it, and the entire course of events became the focus of the dispute between the two countries. Both the Italian and Abyssinian sides held their own views as defenses, each pointing to the other as having provoked the conflict first and intentionally challenging them. Italy used this as an excuse to demand the occupation of the entire country of Abyssinia.</p>
<p>When discussing the responsibility for this incident, one key point needs to be determined: what country does Walwal belong to? According to the provisions of the 1908 treaty, all territories inhabited by natives near the coast should belong to Italy, and all lands in the Ogaden region and territories inhabited by natives near the Ogaden region should belong to Abyssinia. However, this relatively abstract provision cannot solve the actual boundary problem. Therefore, the two sides formed a committee and met in 1910 and 1911, but they dispersed without any results due to the wide divergence of opinions. However, the ethnic provisions in the 1908 treaty are very clear: "All lands in the Ogaden region and territories inhabited by natives near the Ogaden region shall belong to Abyssinia." Walwal is inhabited by the Ogaden natives, so it is self-evident to whom it belongs. Moreover, in addition to the 1908 treaty, there was another agreement between the two sides in that year (negotiated by Abyssinian King Menelik and Italian representative Nerazzini, and formally recognized by the Italian government in a telegram on September 3, 1897, but the text of the agreement was not made public). According to Abyssinia's note to the League of Nations on January 15th of this year, the two countries agreed that Italian Somaliland should be 180 miles from the coast of the Indian Ocean, parallel to the Jubaland River region to Bena Maredara. The Italian government also agreed to Menelik's suggestion to draw a "Arbitral Border Line" on the map within the 180-mile range, which Menelik himself signed and handed to Nerazzini to take back to the Roman government. Based on the above points, Abyssinia has more reason to possess Walwal. Abyssinia declared that Walwal is 200 miles from the coast and has the "Arbitral Border Line" drawn by Menelik, which clearly belongs to the Abyssinian side and is also territory within the Ogaden region. Whether based on the treaties of 1897 or 1908, Walwal is Abyssinian territory.</p>
<p>However, the Italian side also has its reasons. Italy's actual occupation of Walwal has lasted for more than five years. If the land is indeed Abyssinian territory, the Abyssinian government should have protested long ago, but no such statement has been seen in the past five years, which shows that Abyssinia is not the sovereign of the land. Since Walwal is already occupied territory of Italy, the attack by Abyssinian troops and "riotous masses" on the Italian side is an "act of aggression." If this "act of aggression" is not stopped, it will encourage illegal military attacks. According to the Italian military magazine's assessment, if both the 1897 treaty and the 1908 treaty are in effect, there will be three different boundary lines between Italy and Abyssinia. Therefore, the boundary line should be based on the latest treaty (1908), and Walwal, Wardair, and Damot should all belong to the Mijertein clan in Italian Somaliland. In addition, according to the 1885 treaty, Obbia is also within the Italian protected area and has the right to develop into the northeastern interior. Therefore, the wells near Walwal are also within the Italian territory.</p>
<p>After the Walwal Incident, the Abyssinian government requested arbitration based on the 1928 treaty. Italy demanded that the governor of Herar province in Abyssinia apologize, punish the Abyssinian perpetrators and their superiors, formally pay respect to the Italian flag in Walwal, and pay compensation of 20,000 gold pounds. Abyssinia then appealed to the League of Nations under Article 11 of the Covenant (December 14th of last year). Subsequently, because Italy expressed its willingness to reconcile, the League of Nations temporarily refrained from intervening. After several twists and turns in the negotiations between the two countries, the so-called neutral zone was established on March 4th (Gerlogubi-Ado-Walwal-Afdub are all neutral zones). However, Abyssinia hoped to resolve the entire border issue, while Italy only wanted to discuss matters limited to the Walwal incident. The opinions of the two sides diverged again. On March 17th, Abyssinia made a second appeal to the League of Nations, invoking Articles 15 and 10 of the Covenant. Therefore, the Italian government has sent a large army and military supplies to Africa, and the situation is becoming increasingly serious. On April 12th, while the Stresa Conference was in progress, the two governments also agreed to establish an arbitration committee based on the 1928 treaty. At that time, the Italian government, because its military preparations were not yet fully complete, adopted a policy of procrastination. It objected to Abyssinia's appointment of foreigners as arbitrators (one was the French lawyer M. de la Pradelle, and the other was the American Pitman B. Potter), and referred to it as an exposure of Abyssinia's lack of culture, as a respectable national government had no knowledgeable and capable person who could serve as a representative. But this was indeed the case, and the Italian government could not help but acknowledge it. The committee held its first meeting in the Netherlands on June 25th. However, because the opinions of the two sides were far apart (Abyssinia advocated for a complete resolution of the border issue, while Italy insisted on limiting the discussion to the Walwal incident), it was suspended on July 5th. Abyssinia then requested the League of Nations to appoint a fifth arbitrator because the four were divided into two camps and could not make a decision. The League of Nations met on August 3rd and decided to try to get the committee to continue, with two points on the agenda: (1) The committee does not need to discuss the question of who Walwal belongs to, but should discuss the Walwal incident; (2) The arbitrators should proceed quickly and appoint a fifth arbitrator. This case can be said to require compromise. The first point was to appease Italy, and the second point was to accommodate Abyssinia. On August 8th, it was decided to appoint the Greek Ambassador to France, Nikolas Politis, as the fifth arbitrator. After this, the representatives of Britain, France, and Italy held tripartite talks in Paris on August 16th, attempting to divide Abyssinia's interests among themselves, but because Italy's attitude was unacceptable to Britain, the result was a complete failure.</p>
<p>The entire course of the so-called Walwal Incident, from its occurrence to the present, has been described as follows. As the reporter has said before, this is merely an excuse for Italy's military actions to occupy Abyssinia. Therefore, before the case occurred, the Italian government already had a clear plan and early intentions. After the case occurred, the Italian government openly sent a large army to Africa to wash away the shame of Adwa (Italy was defeated by the Abyssinian army at Adwa in 1896) and seize the entirety of Abyssinia to gradually realize its fascist imperial ambitions. The so-called arbitration, the so-called reconciliation, and fundamentally the so-called Walwal Incident are, on the Italian side, merely tools for its actions. The concrete expression of its entire ambition can be seen in the editorial of the Italian People's Newspaper on July 31st (the newspaper was founded by Mussolini, and it is said that most of the editorials are written by Mussolini himself). Its tone is: "It is a fact that Abyssinia is full of oppressed slaves, but this is not the reason for Italy's military action. The racial issue is not a major reason, and the so-called cultural enrichment is not what Italy is concerned with. Italy's real purpose has only two absolutely undeniable points: first, the concrete needs of the Italian nation; second, ensuring the security of East Africa. To solve this problem, the entire matter must be discussed, and to expand influence or establish a protectorate, military action must accompany it. The East African security issue can only be resolved by Italy itself. All disputes between Italy and Abyssinia should be resolved militarily, which is not only simple but also reasonable. We will resolve this problem according to this only path, whether cooperating with the League of Nations, regardless of the League of Nations, or even opposing the League of Nations."</p>

<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Nanchang City's Fire Prevention Week, held on the 21st at the Provincial Stadium with a citizens' assembly and demonstrations of fire prevention, firefighting, and first aid, was previously reported. During the event, the Shanghai Dazhong Trading Company demonstrated its self-made fire extinguishing grenades. Due to hurried preparations and inadequate arrangements, coupled with the wood panels used in the demonstration, which contained extremely high levels of alum water, the effectiveness of the grenade's chemicals was neutralized, preventing it from achieving its intended effect. Subsequently, the Shanghai company received a telegram reporting the situation, expressing deep regret as the grenades had consistently demonstrated remarkable effectiveness in previous demonstrations across various locations. As a result, the company promptly dispatched a technician to Nanchang and, on the 23rd, constructed a large wooden structure at the public stadium for a continued demonstration. The event drew an audience of no less than ten thousand people. The wooden structure was divided into two sections, and fires were ignited simultaneously. The flames quickly soared into the sky, becoming too intense to approach. As the flames erupted from the roof, reaching heights of several dozen feet, a grenade was thrown into the fire by an observer. The fire was immediately extinguished, and within two minutes, all embers were completely gone. This was repeated three times, each time proving successful. The audience erupted in applause, praising the grenade's exceptional fire extinguishing capabilities, unlike anything they had ever seen. Since the 23rd, individuals from all sectors of Nanchang have been eagerly placing orders for the grenades at the Limin Commodity Circulation Agency, the designated distributor.</p>

<p>Hankou Correspondence: During the flooding disaster, eight or nine out of ten people's dikes along the Jianghan area of Hubei Province collapsed. The counties had just finished repairing the breaches, which cost a total of 4.6 million yuan. Unexpectedly, not long after, the autumn floods arrived, and the dikes that had been spared in the first instance, as well as those that had been successfully repaired, collapsed again. Currently, authorities estimate that, based on the original plan to use labor relief for repairs, a total of over 9 million yuan will be required, doubling the initial budget. A telegram has been sent to the central government, earnestly requesting the advance release of the 3 million yuan pledged to facilitate commencement of work. Simultaneously, the Department of Civil Affairs, the Department of Construction, the Jianghan Engineering Bureau, and the Water Disaster Relief General Association have been instructed to select technical and administrative personnel to conduct on-site surveys in various counties. The survey committee members were announced by the provincial government on the 28th through an order, including Shen Jiqing and Yu Xishou for Huangmei and Guangji counties, Guo Xu and Gao Honghuan for Qichun and Peishui counties, Wei Yafan, Peng Yajie, and Lu Shigu for Huanggang and Jiayu counties, Wu Songqiao and Zhang Nixuan for Hankou City and Hanyang County, Yu Chuanzhou and Zhang Lutai for Xiaogan and Huangpi counties, Zhu Youyou and Wang Sichang for Yingcheng and Yunmeng counties, Chen Ying and Sun Shi for Tianmen and Hanchuan counties, Zhang Yuchen and Yao Zhi for Mianyang and Qianjiang counties, Qu Daozong and Song Ziming for Jiangling and Jianli counties, Luo Jin and Zhang Youguang for Shishou and Gongan counties, Xia Fulan and Wang Jiechen for Songzi and Zhijiang counties, Li Shuxin and Chen Tiezhen for Yidu and Yichang counties, Deng Zhirui and Lei Mengsu for Jingyou and Zhongxiang counties, Deng Shi and Pan Kangguo for Yicheng and Jingmen counties, and Zhao Zhihui and Bao Yaoding for Liyang and Guanghua counties. Survey Standards: (A) Survey Standards for People's Embankment Projects: (1) People's Dikes Related to Main Dikes: 1. Those directly connected to main dikes; 2. Those within the main dikes with the function of divider dikes; (2) Important people's dikes and embankments related to a large portion of a county's farmland or multiple counties; (3) City walls used as dikes; (B) Estimation of Projects, divided into the following two points: (1) Projects to restore the original state; (2) Projects to raise and reinforce the original embankment in the future; 1. The height and thickness of main dikes should be estimated using two methods: one based on a height 1.5 meters above the flood level and simultaneously leveling the inner and outer slopes; the other based on a height 2 "Shi Chi" above the highest flood level, only leveling the inner slope.</p>
<p>Estimation standards will depend on the amount of funds available to determine the height of the standard; 2. People's dikes within main dikes that function as divider dikes should be as high as the main dikes; embankments outside the main dikes that impede floodwaters should not be estimated; those that do not impede floodwaters should be estimated at a height 1 meter lower than the main dike; (C) Personnel Assignment Method: (1) The provincial government will dispatch 18 engineering personnel to conduct surveys in the 36 counties and cities with people's dikes; (2) The Water Disaster Relief General Association will dispatch personnel to jointly conduct surveys in the disaster-stricken counties with dikes.

<h3 id="e74">Hankou Chamber of Commerce Requests Improvement of Business Tax; Compiles a Document on Various Industries and Proposes Four Measures <a href="#e74" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c74" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">74</a></h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: Amidst natural and man-made disasters, Hankou's commerce is declining daily. Various industry associations believe that the heavy burden of taxes and levies is a major contributing factor to this phenomenon. They have requested the Chamber of Commerce to forward their concerns to the government and improve the business tax. The Chamber of Commerce convened a general meeting of industry representatives to discuss the matter, resulting in four points: exemption, deferral, reduction, or even complete abolishment, replaced by other taxes. The Chamber of Commerce has submitted these proposals to the Ministry of Finance for review, stating in essence: "Hankou's commercial sector has suffered greatly in recent years due to the impact of natural and man-made disasters. Commerce has declined significantly compared to previous years. In the spring and summer of this year, it was first shaken by silver market fluctuations, leading to a sudden financial panic, followed by a major flood disaster, which caused disruptions in cargo transportation. As a result, accounts receivable for various industries have been difficult to collect, while payments owed for goods have been hard to meet. Although the government has stipulated a method allowing goods to be mortgaged to banks for loans, the strict regulations imposed by banks have made it difficult to provide widespread relief. Even now, following the Shanghai precedent of supporting industry and commerce, a request has been made to the government for the allocation of a large sum of debt financing to provide remedies, which various industries rely on for survival and which the government is expected to approve and implement. However, the back-and-forth of documents will inevitably take time, making it like waiting for rain in the west river to revive dried-up fish, which is too slow to be of immediate help. The current difficulties faced by various industries have already been mentioned. However, bearing various taxes and levies has made the commercial sector unable to bear the burden. Among these, the business tax is the most burdensome for businesses and the public. The opinions of various industries regarding the business tax are detailed below: (1) Request for Exemption: The business tax was initially established to offset the Likin tax. However, customs duties have already increased. The provincial government's financial needs can be covered by allocations from the central government. Furthermore, Shanghai does not have this tax. Considering the special circumstances of Wuhan, requesting exemption based on precedent is reasonable. This is the first point. (2) Request for Temporary Deferral: If the request for exemption cannot be achieved, given the severity of this year's disaster, which is more severe than the major flood of 1931, the precedent of deferring land taxes should be followed. A request should be made to defer the unpaid business tax for various industries this year until the next year when commerce improves, and then reassess the situation to schedule collection, allowing the commercial sector to alleviate some of its burden and preventing the people's livelihoods from being on the verge of collapse. This is the second point. (3) Request for Reduction of Tax Rates: Regardless of whether the measures for exemption and deferral can be achieved, the current business tax rate in this province is excessively high, and there is an urgent need to reduce it. The original tax rates were considered moderate, but after changing to a three-tiered tax system, the increase has been more than several times. For example, the tax on cotton was originally only 0.25%, but was later changed to 1%. After repeated requests for reduction, it was still changed to 0.8%. It is difficult to list all other instances of burdens and difficulties. Furthermore, even when the tax on cotton was 0.2%, other provinces did not have such high taxes. This severely hinders commerce. A request for reduction should be made in advance. This is the third point. (4) Request for Improvement of Tax Collection Methods: While requesting a reduction in the business tax rate, the standards for taxation should also be improved to facilitate implementation. If based on the "Che Ji" method, it would lead to excessive taxes on empty goods, causing unbearable hardship for businesses and the public. If based on the current method, actual amounts would be paid and collected, benefiting both officials and businesses. All statements made are supported by various industries. If maintained, they should be implemented uniformly. In addition to the business tax, if there is a better tax system, such as changing to a production and sales tax or a unified tax, as long as it benefits the public and does not disturb businesses, various industries would be happy to support it. A request is made to modify it accordingly. This is the fourth point. The Chamber of Commerce has verified that all the above-mentioned situations are factual. A request is hereby submitted for review and compliance." (28th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Japanese Side Actively Promotes Economic Cooperation in North China; Various Investigation Teams Come to China for Research and Study; South Manchuria Railway Company Expands Tianjin Office Organization <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The South Manchuria Railway Company's economic investigation of North China seems to have completed its first phase, and the second phase is now beginning. Naka Tokio, the head of the South Manchuria Railway Company's Economic Research Department, responsible for the investigation mission, arrived in Tianjin last week from Shenyang with five team members. After staying for one day, they went to Zhangbei, Guanhua, Zhuolu, and Wande to further investigate mineral resources. After working there, they will go to northern Shanxi to investigate special minerals. The Japanese side believes that the development of the Xuanhua Longyan Iron Mine in Chahar Province requires more than 10 million in capital, so careful consideration is needed on how to exploit it. Doihara, the head of the Kwantung Army Special Service Agency in Shenyang, who is in charge of the Sino-Japanese cooperation plan, took a plane to Chahar on the 23rd to investigate, and plans to go to Shanxi with Colonel Matsui, the Kwantung Army's military liaison officer in Chahar, to discuss economic development and make decisions on military planning. However, there is a lot of skepticism in Japan about investing in and economically cooperating with North China, and capitalists are hesitant to move forward. Even the East Development Company and the East Cotton Company think that it is too little, so the research groups continue to come, one is to collect materials for all parties to study. Within this week, two groups will visit Tianjin. One is the Oriental Association organized within the East Development Company, consisting of Chairman Kawase Tatsuo, Secretary Yamamoto Kitayo, mining expert Tamura Yoshiaki, Ueda Kiyono expert Kimura Yu, etc. It conducts inspections of the textile, industrial, commercial and export trade. After staying in Tianjin for one day, they will go to Shanxi and Suiyuan. The other is the Noda Economic Research Institute, led by Noda Yutaka, accompanied by Mitarai Tatsuo, and Yamazaki Yasuzumi, the owner of the Yamazaki Research Institute in Osaka and an expert in economic commentary at the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun, and seven others. They are collecting various materials on industry, commerce, water conservancy, and mines. After staying in Tianjin for two days, they will go to Ping, transfer to Chahar, and then return to Shandong and Hebei for investigation. On our side, in addition to the Hebei Economic Association recently established in Ping, private organizations in Tianjin such as Gao Lingxiao's Association for Rescuing the Economy of North China, Niu Chuanqi's East Asia Economic Association, and the East Asia Tonghui Trading Company initiated by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and prepared by Pan Yansheng Bian Shoujing, etc., all ignore the benefits and want to take the opportunity to introduce foreign investment and invest in the industry and commerce of North China to make profits. However, the Japanese side believes that the persons in charge are not central figures in industry and commerce and are not very trustworthy. Except for the East Asia Tonghui Trading Company, the authorities are afraid that it will play a role and have banned it from being established. The remaining two organizations exist in name only. However, recently Gong Xinzhan (former Minister of Interior of the Northern Government) and Niu Chuanqi, Shen Tongshi, Gao Lingwei and others organized the North China Economic Association, which has the same nature as the East Asia Economic Association and is responsible for investigation and introduction. It has been approved for registration by the Tianjin Municipal Government and may be more sound than other organizations in the future, and more events will be handled. It is also reported that the South Manchuria Railway Company, in order to promote economic cooperation methods, decided to expand the organization of the Tianjin Office on November 1, and set up four sections: investigation, general affairs, business, and development, and an economic advisory department attached to it, which will take contact with the Kwantung Army Department and the North China Garrison Department. The Pingqingji three offices are all under the jurisdiction of the Tianjin office. The scale is several times larger than before, and the responsibility is not limited to the railway itself. This is something to pay attention to. (27th)</p>

<p>Lu Jingmo, the former director of the Education Bureau of this county, left his post this morning and is now a teacher at Anhui Middle School. His vacancy was filled by Chen Yue, who was appointed by the Department of Education. However, when Lu transferred his responsibilities to the current director, including the economic affairs section, and the former accountant, Lu Zeshan, handed over all the account books last week to the current director, an inspection revealed discrepancies in the accounts, amounting to more than 5,100 yuan. The education sector was shocked, and many requested a detailed investigation. The Education Association has also telegraphed the province to request a thorough investigation. The bureau has sent a letter to the former director, requesting him to provide evidence, otherwise, he must submit 5,100 yuan in cash. The former accountant, Lu Zeshan, said that this may be a mistake in the items and not a loss and has explained to the county magistrate and the chief accountant of the Finance Department stationed in Changshu. The county magistrate intends to clarify the truth and has scheduled a public review at the Education Bureau on the afternoon of the 30th.</p>

<p>The provincial long-distance telephone exchange in this county has been ordered to collect telephone fees from the four rural townships, which has been implemented since September 1st. However, due to the complicated procedures and high fees, the exchange of news between the city and the countryside has been hampered.

<p>The Public Security First Sub-bureau received a telephone report at about 1:00 a.m. on the 27th, saying that the Qingji Steamboat Bureau had captured a thief and requested police detectives to go and arrest him. The bureau immediately sent detective captain Jing Qi and detectives Fu Yulin and five others to investigate. When they arrived at the bureau, there was no one in front of the door. When they went to the accounting room to ask, they replied that there was no such thing. They were surprised and returned to the bureau. Before they had walked a few steps, more than 20 thugs, who had been ambushed in the surrounding corners, rushed out and surrounded them, showering them with fists and feet. The police officers tried to escape, each taking care of himself. However, Fu Yulin was slightly slower in escaping and was grabbed by many people and beaten violently. Fists rained down on him, and he fell to the ground vomiting blood, suffering serious injuries. Upon learning of this, the sub-bureau sent the entire team to rescue them and brought the injured back one by one to be treated by the injury department. On the 28th, it was confirmed that this fake phone call was made from the Yufengtai Hotel outside the East Gate, and the perpetrators are currently under strict investigation.</p>

<p>Since Director Yang took over the business tax in this county, although he has repeatedly intended to rectify it, the business situation is getting worse day by day. Taking the market around the Yuanmenqiao and Jiaochang Street areas as an example, more than ten large shops have closed down since the Mid-Autumn Festival in the lunar calendar. As a result, it is even more difficult to collect the agreed amount of 54,000 yuan from the member stores recognized by the Chamber of Commerce. It is even more impossible to increase the amount beyond the agreement. Although County Magistrate Ma convened representatives from 33 trade associations at the county government to distribute the amount repeatedly, he only obtained more than 49,000 yuan. No matter what, it cannot reach the agreed amount. Therefore, both officials and businesses are extremely difficult. Upon hearing the news, the Provincial Department of Finance specially sent Yao Puchen, the chief of the Second Section, and Zhou, the director of the section, to Yangzhou on the 27th to discuss everything with Director Yang. They returned to the province in the afternoon and are said to be coming to Yangzhou again within a few days for discussion.</p>

<h3 id="e88">League of Nations Health Expert Dr. Stampar to Depart for Yunnan Tomorrow to Assist Yao Yongzheng's Malaria Prevention Program <a href="#e88" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c88" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">88</a></h3>
<p>It is reported by the "Shen Shi She" that Dr. Stampar, a health expert from the League of Nations, after arriving in China, traveled south to Sichuan Province last year for an inspection. He expressed his approval and deep hope for the solutions achieved by the provincial health authorities in diagnosing and treating malignant malaria. This time, the Ministry of Health is sending personnel south, traveling through Guizhou and Guangxi to Yunnan for investigation. After careful research, it was learned that the miasma in that area is a type of malignant malaria. The Ministry of Health, in response to the request of Long Yun, the chairman of Yunnan Province, has continued to dispatch Yao Yongzheng to design prevention and control measures for the province and has also invited Dr. Stampar to assist in the south. After accepting the invitation, Dr. Stampar decided to depart for Hong Kong on the first of next month, taking the route through Annam to Yunnan to assist. It is also heard that Dr. Stampar intends to report the results of his work to the international health conference to be held in Singapore next year.</p>
<p>Cultivating Cinchona Trees</p>
<p>The area along Simao and Honghe in Yunnan Province has fertile land and a favorable climate, but it suffers greatly from the effects of miasma, leading to the abandonment of land, which is a great pity. The provincial Department of Construction, recognizing that cinchona trees can not only be used for general medicinal purposes but also can control this type of miasma, attempted to purchase seeds several years ago. After seven trial plantings, all failed. However, they were not discouraged by the failures and purchased seeds from the Kalajida area of India at a cost of 2,800 yuan. They dispatched personnel to the Honghe riverside area for another trial planting, which was successful. Currently, there are already over 10,000 planted trees, no different from those in India. The Department of Construction plans to further expand the planting area along the Honghe riverside to various places in the Simao interior.</p>
<p>Research on Medicine</p>
<p>Guangxi is located near the tropics, with many mountains, rivers, and trees, which are ideal for the breeding of malarial mosquitoes. Therefore, malaria is extremely prevalent in the province. Although there are no accurate statistics on the annual death rate from malaria, the number must be very high. People generally attribute this epidemic to miasma and mostly resign themselves to fate. People from other provinces also regard Guangxi as a miasma-ridden area, turning pale at the mention of it and treating it as a dangerous path. The provincial authorities deeply feel that the prevention and treatment of this disease are extremely important and have specifically ordered the provincial medical college to conduct research to find the true cause so that methods of prevention and treatment can be devised. After detailed field research by the college, it was discovered that the so-called miasma disease is actually a type of malignant malaria. Now that the truth has been discovered, prevention and treatment are easier to initiate. The province is currently preparing to launch a large-scale anti-malaria campaign. At the same time, Dr. Zeng Guangfang, who previously came to Guangxi to investigate medicinal plants, has already left Guangxi and returned to Shanghai. Yesterday, specific orders were issued to the Guangxi Agricultural Experiment Station and the Baise District Agricultural and Forestry Demonstration Farm to collect samples of white tree oil, two types of tree bark and leaves of the large-leaf tree, and medicinal plant specimens such as "Aina Xiang" (Camphorosma), which will be transported to Shanghai and given to Dr. Zeng for use in testing medicinal materials.</p>
<p>Research on Nuisance Mosquitoes</p>
<p>Malignant malaria has recently been discovered in Minhang and other places near Shanghai, and the spread is quite rapid. The situation is very dangerous. The Shanghai Suburban Mosquito Research Unit, established by the Listers Institute of Preventive Medicine in Gaoqiao, is currently focusing its efforts on this work, and the results are said to be exceptionally good.</p>

In Tokyo, he met with Ambassador Chiang, who is scheduled to return to China at the end of October to attend the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee and the Fifth National Congress. Li Dijun continued, stating that during his time in Japan, he visited Japanese officials and private individuals in a personal capacity, purely for social gatherings. He also participated in a symposium of Japanese cultural and journalistic circles. He concluded that although the trip was short, it was very fruitful. As for whether he will travel to Europe and the United States to inspect the news industry, a decision has not yet been made.</p>
<p>According to the "Xin Sheng She," Lieutenant General Sakatani Rihachiro, a member of the Japanese House of Peers who is familiar with the situation in China and is known as a "China expert," arrived in Shanghai yesterday on the same ship as Li Dijun.

<h3 id="e93">Amidst Reports of Floods in Various Regions, Abundant Harvests of Indica Rice in Hunan and Anhui Provinces, Harvesting Already Completed, New Rice to Be Sold Early Next Month, Rice Prices in Shanghai Decline Due to Congestion of Sources <a href="#e93" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c93" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">93</a></h3>
<p>This autumn, the Yellow River flooded, causing devastation in provinces such as Hebei, Shandong, Henan, Hubei, and other provinces, with fields submerged and huts turned into ruins. The disaster is more severe than that of 1931. Amidst the reports of these floods, Hunan, Jiangxi, and Anhui provinces have all reported bumper harvests of late-season indica rice. Rice prices in Shanghai have fallen due to the large number of goods arriving from various regions. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>Abundant Harvests of Late-Season Rice in Hunan, Anhui, and Jiangxi</p>
<p>Jiangxi, Hunan, and Anhui provinces are well-known areas for indica rice production in China, with considerable harvests each year. Since the beginning of autumn this year, floods have occurred in the Yellow River basin. Except for the counties along the tributaries of the Yellow River, which suffered slight losses, the late-season rice in other counties in the three provinces has achieved a bumper harvest, with yields increasing by 25% compared to last year. The farmers have already completed harvesting, and after milling, the rice will be fully available for sale early next month.</p>
<p>Congestion of Rice Shipments, Rice Prices Decline in Shanghai</p>
<p>Recently, the weather has been mild, and the rural areas have stopped. Rice from the interior is being transported to Shanghai in a continuous stream, causing rice prices to decline in recent days. The current price for Grade A rice is 12.1 yuan, Grade B is 11 yuan, and Grade C is 10.23 yuan. Although the prices of foreign rice are rising in their countries of origin, the inventory in the rice market is limited, and the congestion of "Du Rice" (rice smuggled from Southeast Asia) is causing the market prices to remain stable. Currently, Saigon rice is priced at 10.04 yuan per stone, and "Xiao Jiao" rice is priced at 9.56 yuan per stone.</p>

This contradicts the Ministry's intention to support industry and commerce. We respectfully present the reasons and respectfully request that, considering the difficulties of industry and commerce, the regulations regarding the stamp tax on checks be repealed, which would be greatly appreciated."</p>

<p>Since last year, Shanghai District Court has imposed special restrictions on criminal defendants in detention, prohibiting lawyers from meeting with them before indictment. This practice is unprecedented in other courts. The Shanghai Bar Association has repeatedly negotiated, but without success. Recently, Shen Junru, a standing committee member of the association, again met with Chief Judge Zhong Shangbin, arguing that this system not only sets a unique example for the national courts, but also causes inconvenience to the court, litigants, and lawyers. After sincere consultation, Zhong agreed to follow common practice and allow lawyers to meet with detainees, eliminating the previous special restrictions. Therefore, lawyers are now able to meet with detained suspects who have not been indicted without any obstacles.</p>

<p>The eighty-second batch of forced returnees from Japan, Quan Shoudao, Wu Benxian (both from Qingtian, Zhejiang), and two others, worked in the Fiftieth Block in Tokyo. This time, they were forced by the Japanese police to board the "Rokkaku Maru," arriving in Shanghai at 3:00 PM yesterday. After the ship docked at the Huishan Wharf and they disembarked, they stayed at the Yuelai Inn on Dama Road. They were in a state of extreme distress and planned to request relief from the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau today. Thirty-two distressed overseas Chinese from Belgium returned to the country on the 9th of this month and were jointly provided with relief by the Overseas Chinese Affairs Bureau and the Public Security Bureau, who gave them funds to send them back to their hometowns. Only the representative, Lin Dipu, was left in Shanghai to handle all matters. It is learned that the representative, Lin Dipu, went to Nanjing some days ago to petition the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, requesting arrangements for the distressed overseas Chinese to work at the Qiaole Village. Section Chief Sun of the commission met with him and agreed to consider their situation after the application is approved and facilitate their arrangements based on the conditions in the village, and also gave him ten yuan for travel expenses.

<h3 id="e105">Ningbo Association Supports Zhejiang Relief, All-Zhejiang Relief Association Petitions for Commendation, Requesting the National Government to Award a Plaque to Show Encouragement, Based on Government's Regulations on Rewarding Relief Organizations <a href="#e105" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c105" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">105</a></h3>
<p>The Ningbo Association in Shanghai is a group of Ningbo people in Shanghai, which has always been known for its efforts in supporting charitable and public welfare undertakings in their hometown. In 1930, when Zhejiang Province suffered a flood, the Zhejiang people in Shanghai organized the All-Zhejiang Relief Association. In 1934, when there was a drought, they reorganized the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Relief Association. Both times, the association served as the office, and many of its members participated in relief work and made tireless efforts to raise relief funds. It is now learned that the chairman and committee members of the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Relief Association, Chu Huiseng, Zhang Xiaolin, Wang Xiaoji, and others, believe that the association should be rewarded for its support of relief efforts to encourage others, and therefore, based on the government's regulations on rewarding relief organizations, they petitioned Chairman Lin of the National Government for an award. The text states, "Petition regarding the two times of raising relief funds for the Zhejiang disaster, relying on the support of the Ningbo Association in Shanghai, requesting the awarding of a plaque to show commendation and encouragement. Upon investigation, Zhejiang Province suffered a severe flood in 1930 and a drought in 1934. The Zhejiang people in Shanghai organized the All-Zhejiang Relief Association and the Jiaxu All-Zhejiang Relief Association, which were organized by the Zhejiang people in Shanghai, and they handled the Zhejiang relief efforts under the Central Relief Committee with some success. Hundreds of thousands of dying disaster victims were able to temporarily survive. Looking back, although various philanthropists actively donated to raise funds, the Ningbo Association in Shanghai was the first to care for their hometown and provided the strongest support. All the two disaster agreements used the association's hall as the venue, and it provided various spiritual and material assistance. Its dedication to public service is a model for general community organizations. Now that the association's operations are coming to an end, remembering the two periods of continuous effort, it is believed that the association's contribution cannot be ignored. Therefore, in accordance with the government's regulations on rewarding relief organizations, we respectfully submit this petition to the government for approval, requesting that a plaque be awarded to commend the association and encourage others, which would be greatly appreciated."</p>

<h3 id="e107">The Jisheng Hui (Relief Society) - Detailed Record of Famine Relief Grain Distribution in Tianmen <a href="#e107" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c107" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">107</a></h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Hui (Relief Society) recently received a detailed report from its relief directors in Hubei Province, Hou Yongde and Qian Xinru, from the disaster area of Tianmen. The report stated: (1) The Tianmen County area is mostly plains with a dense population of over 800,000 residents. Over 600,000 have been affected by the disaster, a situation of unprecedented severity. (2) The society initially remitted 3,000 yuan and Han-style currency of 2,000 yuan, totaling 5,000 yuan. This was used to purchase 350 *zu* of rice at about 10 yuan per *fan cheng dou* plus one *liang* (unit of weight, approximately 50 grams). 350 *dan* of broad beans were purchased at about 3.5 yuan per *shi*. This totaled 4,725 yuan, with the remaining 200+ yuan reserved for transportation to disaster areas in the western villages. Each adult received one *sheng* of rice and beans, while each child received half a *sheng*, measured using the *fan cheng dou* plus one *dou* measurement. This was enough to provide for 30,000 adults and 10,000 children. (3) One *fan cheng dou* plus one *dou* is equal to 1.6 *han dou*. With rice and beans figured together, each *shi* costs approximately 4 yuan. Broken rice in Hankou is priced similarly, but broken rice is much less effective at satisfying hunger compared to regular rice and broad beans. (4) On the 20th of this month, an inspection of the first district of the city (several miles from the urban village of Yanglinkou) was made, walking dozens of miles, and only 240 households were inspected. In the future, it is planned to divide the work into three districts (the first and eighth districts of the western villages, and the fifth district of this village) to expedite the process. Villages are spread far apart, with each village consisting of a few dozen households, requiring several miles of travel to reach the next village. Most villages are submerged in water, requiring boats to cross. In many places, travel by land or water is impossible due to the completely muddy conditions, rendering efforts futile. (5) Due to the severity of the disaster, distribution cannot wait until the complete inspection is finished. Once several dozen people are identified, distribution is carried out. Local *baojia* leaders assist in distribution. After distribution, the amount of rice and beans distributed is calculated and announced in the district. (6) In many remote and difficult-to-reach areas, disaster victims are found sick and lying among broken walls and crumbling tiles, nearing death. When questioned, they can only weakly reply with the words "Yu a" (I am), unable to speak further, bringing tears to the eyes. Being fellow humans, their suffering is extreme. An act of compassion and virtue, donating one yuan can save a life, saving others is saving oneself. (7) A large batch of disaster relief medicine was previously received, including 2,500 packets of dysentery powder and 4,500 bottles of Jisheng Dan (pills). Taoist priest Hou carried two large packages of Changchun Dan (longevity pills), which were distributed as needed. Dysentery is widespread, and the medicine is particularly effective. Requests for more are pouring in, urging for more to be sent urgently. (8) On the way from Hankou to Tianmen, the area beyond Liujia was like traveling in the ocean, with no end in sight. The scene of vast areas of land submerged in water is imaginable. It is often said that nine out of ten houses are empty, but now there is no home to return to, no house to be empty. (9) The disaster area of Tianmen is vast, and the current relief funds are just a drop in the bucket. We can only try our best to inspect the poorest, ensuring that every drop counts. How much can a small donation save? We earnestly request all philanthropists to quickly allocate large amounts of relief funds so that dying disaster victims can have their lives extended. Their eyes are filled with hope, and their hearts are breaking with anxiety. It is reported that the Society has added 1,000 yuan in relief funds. Yesterday, the Chinese and Foreign Relief Society sent 5,000 yuan in relief funds to jointly administer emergency relief. Each of the two societies sent a relief worker, Zheng Shouyong and Gu Yabin, to jointly manage the operation, bringing with them a large batch of relief medicine, and departing immediately.</p>

<p>At 11 a.m. the day before yesterday (28th), the staff of the Chinese Association for the Protection of Children held a public banquet at the Hong Kong Road Navy YMCA in honor of Ms. Ding Shujing, who had recently traveled overseas on behalf of the Association to participate in the International Conference on Family Education held in Brussels, Belgium. She had worked diligently and brought honor to her country abroad, and the banquet was a warm welcome and show of respect. Attendees included Association staff Zhang Yueru, Han Chao, Zhao Jian, Liu Yide, Ding Bingnan, and heads of affiliated institutions Yao Shuwen, Huang Huiguang, Wang Baozhu, Wang Zhenchang, and others, totaling over twenty people. Chen Zhengfan delivered a welcoming speech on behalf of everyone, stating that Ms. Ding had departed on May 25th, representing not only the Chinese Young Women’s Christian Association (YWCA) in the World YWCA Executive Committee Enlarged Meeting, but also representing the Association in the Fifth International Conference on Family Education in Brussels, Belgium. Her mission was of great importance. The International Conference on Family Education was initiated by the Belgian educator Dr. De Jost, with the aim of bringing together representatives from various countries and outstanding figures in family education to conduct in-depth discussions to promote family education in various countries. Its significance is undoubtedly great. Ms. Ding's long journey, despite the hardships, made many contributions on behalf of our country at the conference, which not only brought honor to our country but also learned from the strengths of others and compensated for our weaknesses. Her contributions will undoubtedly have a significant impact on the future of family education in our country. Today, we are holding this banquet to express our warm welcome and respect to Ms. Ding, and we are extremely pleased, etc. Ms. Ding Shujing then gave a reply speech, stating that she had been abroad for four months, first taking the Siberian Railway from Vladivostok, passing through Soviet Russia, and arriving directly in Berlin, Germany. After disembarking, she inspected Hitler's rule in that country, then traveled to Geneva, Switzerland, to attend the Enlarged Meeting of the World YWCA Executive Committee. From July 31st to August 4th, she attended the Fifth International Conference on Family Education in Brussels, Belgium. She gained a wealth of practical materials that could be used as a reference for compatriots. Over 300 representatives from 23 countries including England, America, France, Germany, Italy, Belgium, and Switzerland attended the Family Education Conference. In addition to herself, the Chinese delegation included Mr. Ling Qihan, Chargé d'Affaires of the Chinese Legation in Belgium. At the opening ceremony, female students from Brussels participated in performances, and the Queen of Belgium personally opened the ceremony and shook hands with representatives from various countries. However, within a few days, the Queen tragically died in a car accident. The incident was met with deep mourning. The theme of the conference was "Training for a Healthy Personality," which was divided into seven groups for discussion. Many proposals were passed, and the five proposals submitted by our Association were all adopted in principle by the representatives of various countries. The article "The Evolution of Family Education in China" written by the Association's Secretary-General Xu Jianping has been translated into various languages by the conference and will be published in its entirety in the report for reference by countries around the world. Various family education publications sent by the Association to participate in the exhibition (published by Commercial Press, China Press, World Press, Datong, New Asia, Guangxuehui, the YWCA and YMCA, and our Association) were highly praised by people from various countries and received a beautiful honorary certificate, which was very encouraging. The entire collection of publications participating in the exhibition has been donated by myself on behalf of the Association to the conference for permanent preservation. After the conference, I traveled to France and Italy to study their social conditions and women's movements. Then, I crossed the Atlantic Ocean and stayed in New York City for a short time, meeting with classmates from previous years. Finally, due to the heavy workload of my position in Shanghai, I returned to Shanghai on the President Coolidge with Dr. Fei Meide, Vice President of the Association. Today, I am very happy to meet with my colleagues in the Association. I will soon organize and publish what I have learned from this trip and ask for your and the public's guidance, etc. After Ms. Ding's report, she chatted with the people present about the latest developments in Europe and the United States. She thanked everyone and left around 2:30 p.m.</p>

<p>The American Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance believes that although the quality of Xuchang tobacco leaf this year is better than last year and the output has also increased compared to last year, it is still experiencing sluggish sales due to a poor reputation in the past. In order to break this deadlock, it is planned to try to reduce prices through transportation, which will reduce costs and make it easier to sell. Therefore, the committee specially sent Wu Tingsheng, a full-time member of the committee, to Xuchang and Hebei yesterday to discuss the matter with the local government, tobacco merchants, and railway authorities, it is said.</p>

<p>The Da Zhonghua Celluloid Factory on Xiaoshadu Road in West Shanghai unfortunately suffered a fire on June 28th. In addition to the destruction of the factory building, nearby residents were also affected, resulting in injuries and deaths. Subsequently, all the affected residents filed a lawsuit with the First Special Court, seeking compensation for injuries. After the factory paid 30,000 yuan in compensation, the case was settled. However, the factory's work has been suspended since the fire due to the factory site issue, which has led to interference from the Municipal Council. The board of directors, finding it difficult to resolve the aftermath, has been quite passive. Therefore, yesterday afternoon at 4 p.m., a shareholders' meeting was convened at the Ningbo Fellow Villagers Association to discuss a solution. Seventy-five shareholders attended, representing over 16,000 shares. Tong Xinbo was elected as chairman. After the meeting opened, the chairman first reported on the fire and the current state of suspension. After discussion, it was decided to adopt a proactive approach and fully entrust the board of directors to proceed with selecting a suitable location to rebuild the factory as soon as possible. A remote location away from the city center is preferred to avoid the recurrence of danger in the future. Once the factory site is selected, construction and resumption of operations will begin immediately. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<p>The Anhui Series Compilation and Printing Office has already printed four collections of complete books, totaling 54 types and 86 volumes. The content mainly consists of Han studies, textual research classics, and rare and unique works that are not easily obtained in the world. The paper material used is all high-quality domestic Yunsheng paper. The printing and binding are all done with elegance in mind, and the price is extremely low. Therefore, scholars are all happy to purchase them. It is reported that the office is now developing Huangshan as a scenic area in the province, attracting tourists from China and abroad. There is a desire to have descriptions of the scenery, historical overview, and literature of Huangshan, but there is a sense of茫然. It is often impossible to obtain old local chronicles even with the investment of a lot of money. Each book seller only possesses one type and cherishes it as a unique item. Furthermore, miscellaneous publications are often incomplete, vulgar, and insufficient for elegant readers to browse. Therefore, the office has specially selected and compiled three of the most complete and accurate illustrated records of Huangshan: (1) The Revised Huangshan Chronicle, seven volumes, revised by Min Linci, illustrated by Xiao Lingyi; (2) The Huangshan Chronicle, Eight Collected Volumes, edited by Zhushi Tie, illustrated by Xue Zhuang the Monk; (3) The Illustrated Huangshan Classic, written by an anonymous Song Dynasty author, illustrated by Wang Jingu. A total of 26 volumes will be designated as the complete Fifth Collection and will be published and sold at a low price soon, which is truly a boon for those visiting Huangshan. It is also reported that the office has compiled more than 20 types of lyrics by famous Anhui writers, named the First Series of Extra Volumes of the Anhui Series. These are all valuable and hard-to-obtain editions, most of which have been printed and will be available for publication at about the same time. The general distributor of the series is located at 76 Baifa Zhong Road, Shanghai.</p>

Therefore, the results are particularly excellent. In this time of industrial and commercial collapse, there is no other way to save the situation than to promote national goods. Moreover, this year is also Student National Goods Year. All citizens should redouble their efforts to promote national goods to avoid repeating the mistake of the past when the import volume of foreign goods increased sharply during the National Goods Year. This is what I hope from all walks of life and what I use to encourage myself. At the same time, I hope that manufacturers will continue to improve the quality of their products to resist the dumping of foreign goods, etc. Sales of the manufacturers participating in the exhibition continued until 10 p.m.</p>

<h3 id="e122">The Bankruptcy Law Takes Effect Tomorrow – Debtors Who Cannot Pay Their Debts Can Apply for Reconciliation or Bankruptcy According to the Law <a href="#e122" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c122" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">122</a></h3>
<p>The Bankruptcy Law promulgated by the National Government on July 17th of this year, as ordered on July 19th, will take effect on October 1st. Its implementation law was also promulgated earlier on July 18th. All debtors who cannot pay their debts can apply for debt repayment via the reconciliation or bankruptcy procedures stipulated in the law. Whether it is a civil or commercial matter, it can be applied. Details are noted as follows:</p>
<p>Provisions of the Bankruptcy Law</p>
<p>The provisions of the Bankruptcy Law consist of three chapters and 159 articles. Detailed regulations are stipulated regarding the responsibilities of bankrupts or reconciliators, reconciliation procedures, reconciliation agencies, reconciliation methods, declaration and effect of bankruptcy, composition and management of the bankrupt estate, bankruptcy claims, creditors' meetings, distribution of the bankrupt estate, and termination of bankruptcy and restoration of rights. The second section of the second chapter, which stipulates the reconciliation methods of the Chamber of Commerce, is particularly convenient and is a characteristic of Chinese bankruptcy law. In addition to this law, there is also the Implementation Law of the Bankruptcy Law, which has a total of six articles. The text of the law will be published in the tenth issue of the Commercial Monthly.</p>
<p>History of the Bankruptcy Law</p>
<p>Yan E'sheng, Secretary of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, said that China's bankruptcy law began with the Bankruptcy Law of the 32nd year of the Guangxu reign, which was compiled by Wu Tingfang and Shen Jiaben and had a total of 69 articles. It was only applicable to merchants. In the 33rd year of the Guangxu reign, Article 40 of the law stipulated that the percentage of repayment should be handled uniformly for all creditors, which was inconsistent with the usual practice of first paying foreign debts, then official debts, and then proportionally distributing to Chinese and foreign merchants. It was opposed by the Ministry of Commerce and explicitly repealed. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, the Beijing Law Revision Office drafted a bankruptcy law, and in the 23rd year, the Judicial and Administrative Department of the National Government also drafted a bankruptcy law, but neither became formal law. In August of the 23rd year, because adjudicators often encountered bankruptcy cases but had no clear legal basis, the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Justice jointly drafted the Provisional Regulations for the Settlement of Merchant Debts, which were submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and filed by the Central Political Conference. However, its application was limited to merchants. After the Bankruptcy Law takes effect on October 1st, according to Article 5 of the Implementation Law of the Bankruptcy Law, the Provisional Regulations for the Settlement of Merchant Debts will simultaneously lose their effectiveness.</p>
<p>Deliberations by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce stated that the Bankruptcy Law stipulates a section on Chamber of Commerce reconciliation. In the future, when merchants are unable to pay their debts, they must first request Chamber of Commerce reconciliation. The recently handled reconciliation case of the Huaying Pharmacy is an example of this. Therefore, in addition to the various procedures prescribed by law, detailed measures are being discussed to accept handling procedures.</p>
<h3 id="e123">A Hooligan Repeatedly Extorted and Intimidated, the Owner of a Tiger Stove Tragically Died by Suicide <a href="#e123" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c123" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">123</a></h3>
<p>Ding Ruqing, a native of Yancheng, lived at 736 Gonghe Xin Road, Zhabei, was 47 years old. Hooligans often provoked him for no reason in the tiger stove he owned. Ding was naturally weak and afraid of accidents. Therefore, he was always frowning and his nerves were greatly stimulated. Although someone like Lu Zhonglian came forward to mediate, no satisfactory solution was reached. The hooligans were still threatening, preparing to use violent means. Upon hearing this news, Ding was very uneasy and had recently undergone a change in behavior, muttering to himself all day long. The day before yesterday, Ding Ruqing committed suicide in his room. It was not until yesterday morning that his wife, Ding Zhou, discovered him. She cried loudly, and everyone who heard of it was saddened. They pitied the misery of the deceased and guided Ding Zhou to report to the police station and request that the hooligans be arrested and severely punished according to the law. At the same time, Jin Yitu, the local *baojia* leader, Huang Hongsheng, reported to the local court and requested a coroner's inquest. After receiving the report, the court dispatched prosecutor Du Jiasheng and coroner Shen Xian to investigate the scene and prepare the coffin for investigation.</p>

<p>In the desolate area of Jiangjiatang, south of Hongqiao Town in western Shanghai, bandits frequently appear. Yesterday morning at 4:40 AM, more than ten robbers speaking in a mixed foreign accent and wearing short clothes (four of them carrying pistols) suddenly broke into the residence of Shen, a current technician at the Municipal Land Bureau, in Shenjiatang. The entire Shen family was awakened from their dreams and forced into one room by the robbers, who forbade them from making any noise. The robbers then rummaged through chests and cabinets, searching arbitrarily. Next, they broke into the home of Shen Pinfang, a neighbor. At that time, Shen's cousin, Shen Jingting (45 years old), had just returned home from the Huangjia Garden. Upon hearing about the robbery in his family's home, he disregarded everything, leaped onto the robber acting as a lookout outside the door from behind, and captured him. The robber pulled out a pistol and fired two shots at Shen Jingting, one hitting his right shoulder and the other his right leg. After being wounded, Shen fell to the ground. Hearing the gunshots outside, the other robbers did not dare to stay longer and fled north with the loot. At that moment, Huo Fengchi, the police chief of the Hongqiao Town police station, was leading a patrol when he heard the gunshots. He rushed to the scene to pursue the robbers, but they had already gone far. Therefore, he sent the wounded Shen Jingting to the Red Cross Hospital on Haig Road overnight for treatment. It is reported that the bullet in his right shoulder has not yet been removed, and his life is in critical condition. The homeowner has filed a loss report with the relevant Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Yang Xuechen, a Chinese detective from the Hongkou Police Station, arrested Zhu A'gen, a Wuxi native, in Jiugeng Lane, Feilun Road, on the evening of the 18th of this month at 9:40 PM for selling the drug red pills. 130 red pills were found on him. Zhu confessed that the principal offender was Ding Buren, a Yangzhou native nicknamed "Xiao Kai," who sold the pills through him. He was sent to the First Special Court, where he was found guilty and sentenced to eight months in prison. Subsequently, Detective Yang, who was handling the case, apprehended Ding in Jiugeng Lane, brought him to the police station, and had him stand among other suspects. Zhu A'gen correctly identified him. The next morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi held a trial, but Zhu suddenly changed his testimony, claiming that Ding Buren was not the person and that he had falsely accused him at the police station. The defendant also overturned his confession given at the police station. The court ordered him to be detained and await sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Jiang, presiding over the First Criminal Court, sentenced Ding Buren to one year in prison. The number of days detained before the final judgment will be deducted from the sentence at a rate of two days for each day of imprisonment.</p>

<p>Chen Xinyi (40 years old), a Catholic from Taowuling, 60 li south of Nanjing, who worked as a primary school teacher in the countryside, had an eldest daughter named Chen Zhiying, 19 years old. After graduating from a local high school, she came to Shanghai two years ago and entered the Xuhui Girls' Middle School, a Catholic school in Xujiahui, western Shanghai, where she was studying in her second year of high school. On July 1st of this year, the school started its summer vacation. The next morning at 9:00 AM, Zhiying accompanied a classmate home, taking a car to the North Station. There, she met Cui Wang (34 years old), a fellow Catholic and the cousin of her classmate Jiao Yunying (Cui often visited the school to see Jiao, so the girls knew each other). Cui forcibly took her to her home at No. 31, Jiale Road, in the French Concession. First, Cui's husband, Cui Kedong, seduced and defiled her. Then, under the pretext of recommending her for a nursing position, he had her write a letter of intent. With his accomplices, he forcibly took her to the Wang Zhang brothel at No. 48, Hengmaoli, in the Eight Immortals Bridge area, where she was forced into prostitution. From then on, Zhiying fell into the abyss, unable to escape, and lived a life of flesh for more than a month. Finally, she secretly wrote a letter to her parents. Her father, Chen Xinyi, came to Shanghai, reported the matter to the French police, and had Cui and the brothel owner, Wang Zhang, and the pimp, Xue Fengming, arrested, rescuing his daughter from danger. The defendants were sent to the Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The details have been reported in this newspaper. The police investigation has concluded. The other day, Judge Zhang Chaozuo of the Special Court presided over a hearing in the First Criminal Court. Yuan Jiahuan, a lawyer from the Police Department, filed charges against the defendants based on Articles 241, paragraphs 1 and 2, and Articles 143 and 296 of the Criminal Law for offenses against the family and offenses against freedom. He also detailed the investigation process and requested that they be severely punished according to the law. Subsequently, the victim, Chen Zhiying, testified in detail about her ordeal. The judge then ordered the defendants to be questioned separately. Huo Kedong and his wife continued to deny and prevaricate. However, Cui admitted to introducing her for prostitution, claiming that the girl was in debt and volunteered to become a prostitute. Wang Zhang claimed that Chen Zhiying was brought by Cui Kedong and others and asked about her. The girl claimed that she was a willing prostitute, and she did not know about any kidnapping or coercion. Xue Fengming denied being married to Wang Zhang, claiming that they were cousins and that he was arrested while visiting. The remaining testimonies of each defendant were the same as in the previous court hearing. After comparing the testimonies in court, the judge adjourned the hearing for further investigation. The defendants were returned to custody separately.</p>

<p>Li Xingda, the youngest daughter of farmer Li Guo from Lijiazhai, Yachapu, outside the South Gate of Changzhou, is a charming and beautiful young woman of eighteen. A few days ago, she took the Shanghai-Nanjing train to Shanghai to find her older sister (who works as a nanny for a foreigner in Shanghai). After getting off the train, she did not know the way. She was holding a note with the address of her sister's employer and asked passersby for directions. A scoundrel teenager approached her and feigned helpfulness, offering to take her to her sister's place. Xingbao trusted him and was taken to the Baoshan Hotel on Baoshan Road, where she was forced to stay and sleep with him for three nights. The teenager intended to sell Xingda to a brothel. He even brought people to the hotel to look at her and negotiate the price. Xingda discovered his intentions. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, the teenager took Xingda out, and they rode in a rickshaw, intending to take her to the brothel and collect the money. When the rickshaw entered the intersection of North Henan Road and Bazilu Road in the Public Concession, Xingda saw a Chinese police officer No. 164 standing in the middle of the road. Xingda shouted for help. Before the officer could question Xingda, the teenager took the opportunity to escape without a trace. The officer then took Xingda to the Huishi Police Station to report to the chief for further investigation.</p>

<h3 id="e134">Chinese Institute of Engineers: General Report on Association Affairs: New President to Take Office Tomorrow, Welcome Reception Held Yesterday <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>The newly elected president of the Chinese Institute of Engineers, Yan Deqing, and vice president, Huang Boqiao, will take office on October 1st, according to the association's constitution, replacing the outgoing president, Xu Peihuang, and vice president, Yun Zhen. Yesterday, the association held a board meeting to welcome the new president and to thank the outgoing president Xu Peihuang and vice president Yun Zhen. President Xu also presented the association's general report on its affairs for the past year, demonstrating the association's progress. Excerpts are as follows: (1) Regarding the Industrial Materials Testing Laboratory, since the association contracted Zhang Yutai Construction Factory to build the Industrial Materials Testing Laboratory in the central district of the city in July last year, it has taken ten months to complete the construction. The original completion date was the end of last year, but due to the failure to receive the donated materials on time, it was delayed until June of this year. The total project is valued at approximately 50,000 yuan. After deducting the donated materials worth approximately 15,000 yuan, 35,000 yuan in cash still needs to be paid. (2) Regarding the planning for the laboratory's equipment, the association appointed Shi Konghuai, Kang Shiqing, and Shen Taiqing, three members of the Industrial Materials Testing Laboratory Equipment Committee, to compile a list of equipment. The board of directors then resolved to invite experts such as Sa Fujun, Li Farui, Shen Yi, Gu Yuxiu, Zhang Kezhi, Zhao Zukang, Zhang Xiaoliang, and Du Guangzu to review it first. According to the experts' review opinions, the first step is to raise 100,000 yuan to purchase machinery, and the second step is to expand further. (3) Regarding the continued fundraising for the testing laboratory, at last year's annual meeting, the Shanghai branch proposed that the association raise 100,000 yuan in cash to purchase equipment for the materials testing laboratory. The 15th board meeting resolved to prioritize fundraising from members. There are more than 1,250 members, and each person donating 40 yuan would be sufficient to reach the quota. In addition to distributing the donation requests to each member, the local branches are also requested to encourage donations. On the executive side, it is planned to organize fundraising teams with each branch as a unit, proportional to the number of members in each area. Each team will have one leader responsible for soliciting donations from members, with a goal of 40 yuan per person. The Shanghai branch has already started, and the Taiyuan and Daye branches have already remitted donations, with excellent results. In addition, requests for subsidies are being made to government agencies, and donations of testing machines are being solicited from famous foreign factories. This is currently being negotiated. (4) Regarding the academic organization joint association, the Chinese Institute of Mining and Metallurgical Engineering and 17 other groups proposed to organize a joint association in the capital, with the main purpose of seeking practical unity among engineers, increasing work efficiency, and adapting to the needs of national construction. The government allocated 4.2 mu of land at 40% of the official price, with the municipal government donating the other 60% of the land price, along with the cost of seedling removal, totaling over 1,700 silver dollars. The preparatory meeting resolved that each group should pay a membership fee of one to three units, with each unit being 150 yuan, to cover the land purchase costs. The rights and obligations of each group will be based on the number of units. The association decided to take one unit, with one unit being undertaken by the Nanjing branch. The association's location and the organization of the articles of association are also under discussion. (5) Regarding the Guangxi inspection team, the association, upon invitation from the Guangxi Provincial Government this year, organized a Guangxi inspection team to conduct on-site research on various construction issues in Guangxi. All travel expenses and hospitality will be borne by the Guangxi Provincial Government. The association's board of directors selected Gu Yuxiu as the leader and He Zhitai, Zhuang Xiaozhen, Lu Fengshu, Fang Gupu, Chan Zhen, Gu Yuxiu, Zhuang Qianding, Zhang Hongyuan, He Chan, Zhao Zengjue, Hu Boyuan, and Shen Naishan as members. All members departed for Guangxi from Shanghai and Wuhan on July 15th. The inspection period is estimated to be about one month. (6) Regarding participation in the meeting on weights and measures, the National Compilation and Translation Bureau requested the association to express its opinions on the differences between the names of physics terms promulgated by the Ministry of Education and the names of weights and measures laws promulgated by the National Government. The 16th board meeting of the association resolved to petition the Executive Yuan to convene a meeting of physicists, engineering experts, and weights and measures experts. Subsequently, when the Executive Yuan convened the meeting, the association appointed Chan Zhen to attend the discussion. There were no substantial results in the first meeting. According to this standard unit name for weights and measures, there are not many disputes on the definition of the unit. The only thing that needs to be discussed is the unit itself and its name. A survey was drafted and distributed to members, requesting their responses. Unfortunately, the time was too short, and not many responded. The statistical results are listed below: 1. Most people advocate for a partial modification of the unit names in the current weights and measures law. 2. Most people advocate that the standard weights and measures system should only adopt one name for each unit as the main unit, and the remaining units should use the combined name of the main unit and decimals (not number of names). 3. Most main units advocate for using meters, acres, and liters, and a few advocate for using "mike-li" (meters-kilograms-liters). (Majority accounted for 53%, minority accounted for 41%, others accounted for 6%. 4. Most people advocate for using ten, hundred, thousand, million, billion, and trillion for large numbers, and fen, li, hao, si, hu, and wei for small numbers. (To be continued)</p>

<p>The Mainland News reported that Mr. He Shi, the liquidator of the American Agricultural Bank, claimed yesterday that all deposits in the American Agricultural Bank of less than 50 yuan would be paid starting on October 1st, as requested several days ago by the Chief Justice of the American Court in China. He has been signing checks for days, and his wrists are almost broken. There are a total of 3,200 households, with the smallest amount being only 5 yuan. It is estimated that the depositors have already left Shanghai and forgotten about it. The total amount to be returned is approximately 42,000 yuan, with an average of approximately 13 yuan per household. The liquidation office will move to the Da Lai Mansion on the first day of this week, renting four rooms. The cost can be viewed as a significant saving compared to before.</p>

<p>Rural bankruptcy and the decline of all industries are unavoidable. The petroleum business is no exception. Recently, there have been rumors that domestic oil companies have requested government support. However, it is heard that the authorities believe that domestic oil businesses should be maintained to avoid being completely controlled by foreign merchants. However, petroleum is of great importance to national defense, transportation, and the development of industry and commerce. Modern countries have adopted protection policies, either implementing control or providing refining and storage. It seems that our country should follow suit. It is planned to utilize the existing tank facilities of domestic oil merchants to pilot state-owned operations or even expand them. In addition to import and sales, self-refining must also be piloted. In the future, self-extraction must be further developed.</p>

<p>The Japanese-language Mainichi Shimbun reported that the crackdown on smuggling silver in Xiamen has been very strict recently. On the 16th of this month, when the merchant ship Fengshan Maru of the Xiamen-Kaohsiung route was leaving Xiamen, 3,000 yuan of smuggled gold and silver were discovered. On the 11th, when the Guangdong Maru was sailing to Taiwan, a Taiwanese courtesan was found to have hidden 200 yuan in her possession, which was discovered by customs officials. The courtesan attempted to escape but accidentally fell into the sea. Because she had silver on her body, she sank and did not surface until the 17th.</p>

<p>Shao, a woman named Ren Dong, is 40 years old. She only had one daughter, named Aina, who is now 19 years old. Due to financial problems, she left her hometown last summer and came to Shanghai to learn dancing. On September 12th, she entered the Juelu Dance Hall on Xizang Road as a dancer. Li Yuzao, the son of a prominent family from Qibao Town, was 22 years old. He fell in love with her at first sight. After several meetings, they had a physical relationship. Soon, Aina became pregnant and stopped working as a dancer. On July 19th of this year, she gave birth to a daughter. However, misfortune struck. Li Yuzao abandoned Ren Aina and ignored her. Aina could no longer tolerate it. Accompanied by her mother, Ren Dong, she filed a complaint with the criminal court of the local court, accusing Li Yuzao of interfering with her family and seduction. The complaint stated that after their first meeting, the defendant seduced the plaintiff, first taking her to see a play at the Samsung Theater, and then to the Shenzhou Dance Hall. The second time they met at the Yangzi Hotel on the fourth floor. After that, they easily met at various locations. When the plaintiff's mother returned to her hometown on business, the defendant even became a frequent visitor to the plaintiff's home (Chongli, Malang Road, Lafayette Road), which was witnessed by many. The defendant deceived the plaintiff due to her youth, falsely claiming that he was not married and willing to marry the plaintiff. The plaintiff was secretly delighted, thinking that she had found someone to rely on for life, and did not suspect anything else. Unexpectedly, the defendant recently sent a letter scolding the plaintiff in every possible way, intending to break up with her. The plaintiff suddenly woke up from her dream and realized that she had been deceived. By this time, the defendant's promise to marry her had vanished into thin air. As a last resort, she had to file a lawsuit according to the law, requesting an investigation. After receiving the complaint, the court issued a subpoena, but the defendant did not appear. The other day, Judge Wu Deying held a trial, but the defendant still failed to appear. Only the plaintiff and her mother appeared in court and testified about what happened. The judge ordered the defendant to be arrested and interrogated before further hearing.</p>

<p>Gong Haigen, a local from No. 3, Qianjiazhai, Yangsi Township, Pudong, owned a pier boat and hired Yao A'mei, a local, as the captain to supervise the crew in transporting goods. On the afternoon of the 19th of this month at 4:00 PM, Gong was playing mahjong in a teahouse near the pier. Yao needed money for expenses on the boat and went to the teahouse to ask Gong for one yuan. Gong refused, saying he had no money. Yao saw a five-yuan banknote on Gong's table and insisted on getting change to pay him. The two began to argue and then wrestled to the boat by the port, resulting in a major conflict. Somehow, Yao suddenly fell into the river and died. The next day, the body floated near the area. After the family retrieved it, two people on bicycles resembling public officials arrived at the scene and instructed the family to collect the body first and wait for verification. The deceased's family followed their instructions and prepared a coffin for burial. After several days, the family members became concerned that Gong had not taken any action and had not mentioned anything about the deceased's affairs. The deceased's aunt, Zhang Yao (72 years old), went to Gong's house to make a scene, but it was to no avail. Although this case originated in the countryside and was not immediately known to the police, the news spread further and further. Yesterday morning, the Tangqiao police learned of the incident and summoned the deceased's wife, Jiang Min (17 years old), the deceased's father, Yao Bojiang (56 years old), and the injured aunt, Zhang Yao, for questioning. They all claimed that after the deceased was knocked down by Gong, they retrieved the body shortly afterward. Two people claiming to be from the local court instructed them to collect the body, so they did not dare to resist. When Yao Min went to Gong's house to negotiate the deceased's affairs, he was also attacked and injured. The police chief believed that the local court would never send two people on bicycles to verify the body without first instructing the local bailiff to report it. It was clear that the two unknown men were impersonating public officials and had other motives. It was still unconfirmed whether the deceased was pushed down by Gong. The police immediately dispatched officers to the countryside to arrest him, but Gong had already fled in fear and disappeared without a trace. The police ordered the deceased's family to return first and immediately summoned the local bailiffs Chen Zhixiang and Zhao Musheng to report to the court to send someone to open the coffin for an autopsy in order to apprehend the murderer and investigate the case.</p>

<p>A. The Origin of the Opium Evil</p>
<p>Opium is produced in India and was first imported into our country during the early Qing Dynasty. At that time, the people of the whole country were unaware of the harm of opium and regarded it as a recreational product. Who knew that under these circumstances, unknowingly, it would lure many of our compatriots into the sea of suffering, creating irresolvable pain. From then on, the import of opium increased day by day, and its poisonous effects spread throughout the country. At this time, the Qing court also knew that the harm of opium was too great and could not bear to see it spread. Therefore, in the eighteenth year of Daoguang, Lin Zexu was ordered to go to Guangdong to handle the prohibition of opium, arrest opium merchants, and confiscate property. Because the measures were too radical, it triggered the Opium War and the signing of many unequal treaties, which placed our country under heavy constraints, and we have not been able to relax until now. After this setback, not only did the import of opium become greater than before, but the national power also weakened day by day. Looking back now, we truly feel a pain so deep that we have no tears to shed.</p>
<p>B. The Harms of Opium</p>
<p>From a broad perspective, there are approximately the following types:</p>
<p>(1) Affecting the country's economy. In recent years, China's economy has entered a state of bankruptcy, which is an undeniable fact. Although there are more than one reason for this, the import of opium and other narcotics, this shocking drain, must also be considered a major fatal blow. According to a customs investigation in 1926, more than 40 million taels were imported from India, and more than 18 million boxes of red soil were imported from Persia. In addition, the import of morphine, cocaine, heroin, and other drugs also amounted to more than 1 million taels. Furthermore, according to a survey in Dalian alone, 698,897 taels of opium were imported into that place, with a value of over a million. The total amount of outflow is more than ten million yuan. China was originally a country with a trade deficit. Adding this huge amount of outflow, how can the national economy not go bankrupt? How can people's livelihoods not be difficult? If we want to restore our rights and interests and cultivate a bit of vitality for the country, we only have one way: to ban opium!</p>
<p>(2) Affecting the country's health. In any nation, if there are too many smokers, that nation will inevitably weaken. This is an irrefutable law. Because mentally weak smokers will inevitably not produce physically healthy children. If this is passed down from generation to generation, the spirit of the entire nation will inevitably be invisibly eliminated. The reason why our Chinese nation is not valued by foreigners and is called the "sick man of East Asia" is because there are too many smokers and their spirits are not invigorated. If we want to maintain our nation and always occupy a place in the era of survival of the fittest, we must first ban opium, which is harmful to health!</p>
<p>(3) Affecting the nation's status. Since the import of opium into our country, many anti-smoking regulations have been signed with foreign countries over the years, such as the "Regulations on the Prohibition of the Transport of Morphine, Opium, and Drug Needles" in the thirty-fourth year of Guangxu in the former Qing Dynasty, the "Chapter on the Prohibition and Restriction of Morphine into China" in the third year of Xuantong, the International Opium Convention of the Hague Peace Conference in the second year of the Republic of China, and the successive meetings of the Narcotics Committee of the League of Nations, etc. However, the domestic opium ban is still lax, and poppies are everywhere, which has brought international credibility and the nation's status to an unimaginable level. It is also remembered that in the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, our country's representatives passed the proposal of the British Far East Opium Investigation Group at the Geneva International Anti-Smoking Conference. This is all great evidence. If our people still do not realize this and still regard this harmful opium as a pastime, the future disasters will not only be the decline of the nation's status!</p>
<p>(4) Affecting social order. As the saying goes, "When a person is poor, his ambitions are short." This means that when a person is at the end of his rope and has no money to use, he will do anything, even join a gang of thieves. We cannot attribute the cause of poverty entirely to opium use. Many crimes in cities have nothing to do with smoking. However, a person who uses opium will sooner or later embark on a path of poverty. Therefore, all illegal and immoral things are decided when puffing smoke in the opium den. Therefore, the maintenance of social order depends on how many poor people there are in this society. In other words, if there are more opium smokers in this society, even if it is not visible for a while, it will affect the future. People who smoke like this will inevitably reach the end of their road and be unable to be saved. Therefore, from the standpoint of social order, we must abandon this important factor that causes social poverty and crime.</p>
<p>(5) Affecting the people's food supply. Anyone who has been to Sichuan and Yunnan knows that the farmland in these provinces has mostly been converted to growing opium poppies in recent years, and agricultural crops are regarded as by-products. Therefore, the output of opium has increased day by day, and the output of rice and wheat will naturally decrease day by day. How can the domestic food supply not be lacking? China is known as an agricultural country, and an agricultural country cannot even maintain its own food supply and must rely on foreign countries. Needless to say, this is entirely due to the influence of opium cultivation.</p>
<p>From a small perspective, there are approximately the following types:</p>
<p>(1) Harming one's personal health. People who smoke opium are always lying in bed all day long, living a life of indulgence and ignoring day and night. All their energy and brainpower are absorbed by the opium poison. On the physical side, it is of course impossible to talk about being strong and lively, and they will also show an indescribably haggard appearance. Therefore, it is not too harsh to ridicule smokers as "opium ghosts." People who are addicted to opium are simply digging their own graves and seeking their own death.</p>
<p>(2) Losing one's personal wealth. People who smoke opium may only be indulging in a pastime at first and do not think about the economic losses. However, after becoming addicted, they feel that they cannot stop. Knowing that it costs money, they have to endure the pain with peace of mind. Unconsciously, they squander all their family property. In the end, some become beggars, and some become thieves. There are countless such common occurrences. How heartbreaking this is!</p>
<p>(3) Destroying family happiness. The reason why a family is harmonious and prosperous is that each person can take responsibility to work and earn money. If one person does not engage in honest work and becomes addicted to opium, not only will there be one more useless person in the family, but production will inevitably decrease, and expenses will increase even more. Over time, the economy will inevitably go bankrupt, and even family members may become strangers, and husbands and wives may become resentful. Even unexpected tragedies may occur. Because one person smokes opium, the happiness of the entire family is affected. The harm of opium is so severe, why not make a decision to get rid of it?</p>
<p>C. Determination and Steps for Banning Opium</p>
<p>The poisonous effects of opium are enough to destroy our country and wipe out our nation. Since Lin Zexu's implementation of the opium ban failed, whether it was the Qing court or the Northern Warlords, they have continued to promote the opium ban. But why has the opium ban not been eradicated until now? There are only two reasons: (1) The government does not have the determination to completely ban opium. (2) The government does not have practical and feasible methods for banning opium. Because the past opium bans only had clauses on punishing opium users, but did not have fundamental measures to eradicate opium seedlings and prohibit planting and smoking in stages. Therefore, the production of opium has increased year by year, and the number of smokers has also increased year by year. Now, Chairman Chiang Kai-shek has indeed made the greatest determination on the item of opium prohibition, starting from the root and adopting the six-year opium eradication plan decided by the previous National Congress. It has been decided that the period from this year to 1940 shall be the eradication period. In addition to strictly stipulating regulations and prohibiting planting in stages, the two most effective methods are adopted to prohibit opium use. One is to promote the New Life Movement to change social customs and encourage the people to assist the government in banning opium. The other is to use scientific methods under the extremely fair and extremely systematic principles to make smokers quit smoking in stages. The first step is to hold a general registration of smokers nationwide, to know the total number of smokers nationwide, as a standard for reducing the number of smokers year by year. This city has adhered to the government's opium prohibition plan and has already registered in July. From July to the end of September is the period for voluntary registration. During this period, people are allowed to voluntarily surrender for rehabilitation or obtain a license. From October to the end of December is the period for mandatory registration. During this period, the arrest of private smokers will begin, and fines will be imposed according to law. After that, mandatory registration will be carried out. Regarding the opium prohibition steps, they are set to be six years in accordance with the government's plan, from this year to 1940. The steps are: (1) From July to November 1935, register smokers and issue limited-term smoking cessation licenses. (2) From 1936, the issuance of limited-term smoking cessation licenses will be stopped. At least one-fifth of all registered smokers must quit. Those who have not quit will exchange for new licenses. (3) In 1937, at least two-fifths of the registered and licensed smokers must quit. Those who have not quit will exchange for new licenses. (4) In 1938, at least three-fifths of the registered and licensed smokers must quit. Those who have not quit will exchange for new licenses. (5) In 1939, at least four-fifths of the registered and licensed smokers must quit. Those who have not quit will exchange for new licenses. (6) In 1940, all registered and licensed smokers must quit, and the smoking cessation licenses will be handed in for cancellation.</p>
<p>D. The Meaning and Procedures of Registration</p>
<p>(1) Why register? The call for banning opium has been going on for decades. Although it is not heard everywhere and at all times, the result is still that those who ban it ban it, and those who smoke it smoke it. This is of course inevitable as a means of collecting money in the era of warlords, and it is also because there are no perfect methods. Now the government has seen that the past opium bans have not achieved considerable results, so in considering both sides, it has come up with a registration method. Because to implement the opium ban, the first step is to know the total number of smokers in the country. In the total number, we must further analyze how many young people there are, how many middle-aged people there are, and how many elderly people there are. Only by obtaining this statistics can we gradually advance and reduce the number of smokers year by year, so that ordinary smokers can quit comfortably without any pain. If we still use the past method of no statistics and do not give smokers a considerable amount of time to quit, we want to immediately eradicate opium, which has been poisonous for decades, which is absolutely impossible in reality. Therefore, the government asserts that the most effective method of banning opium and the most painless way for smokers to quit is registration.</p>
<p>(2) What are the benefits of registration? The so-called registration is not about getting a license and becoming an official opium smoker, and no one will interfere with you anymore. If you have this kind of thinking, then this is a big mistake. You must know that smoker registration, on the one hand, is the government expressing its determination to ban opium and awakening the attention of smokers, and on the other hand, it is to make registered smokers know how many years are left for the smoking period, and to gradually reduce the amount of smoking according to their own smoking amount, so that they can quit as scheduled, get out of the sea of ​​suffering, and become a healthy citizen. Or if you feel the pain of smoking, you can immediately ask the Public Security Bureau to send you to the Municipal Smoking Cessation Hospital, which will help you quit for free. Only registered smokers can get this kind of preferential treatment.</p>
<p>(3) What are the disadvantages of not registering? This time, the government's implementation of the opium ban has a very great determination, not like the past, when it was just a matter of following the story to cover up one's eyes and ears. The reason why we want to register first is to take into account the actual difficulties and eliminate the pain of smokers. If smokers do not understand the government's determination and kindness, and still wait and see, treating it as a ban on opium that has been followed many times in the past, in the future, after the registration time has passed, not only will they not be able to apply for registration again, but they will also not be able to get free smoking cessation, and if they are found out, they will be severely punished. Smokers, think about it carefully, what is the point of this? Do you really want to be forever mired in the sea of ​​suffering, willing to be a despicable person who is not tolerated by the country and despised by compatriots?</p>
<p>(4) Registration Procedures</p>
<p>All registration matters are handled by the Municipal Public Security Bureau. Anyone applying for an ordinary smoking cessation license must first fill out a registration application form and go to the Public Security Bureau or its sub-bureaus to apply for registration. The Public Security Bureau or its sub-bureaus will issue a license based on the filled form. As for those who apply for a poor people's license, in addition to filling out an application form, they must also provide a guarantee letter. After an investigator is sent to investigate, a poor people's license will be issued. As for those who request smoking cessation, they must also fill out an application form and guarantee letter. After the investigation is clear, they will be sent to a smoking cessation hospital for free treatment.</p>
<p>The Municipal Public Security Bureau, in consideration of the difficulty for smokers to find a guarantor, has specially stipulated the qualifications of the guarantor. All relatives and friends of the smoker who have a confirmed address and a proper profession can serve as guarantors. It is not necessary to find a shop guarantor. The guarantor of the poor people's smoking cessation license only needs to guarantee that the smoker is not impersonating a poor person. The guarantor of those who request smoking cessation only needs to guarantee that the smoker will not deliberately evade when they are summoned for investigation after being discharged from the hospital, and there is no other responsibility. Therefore, there is no need to worry too much about serving as a guarantor for a smoker.</p>
<p>E. Hope for Opium Prohibition</p>
<p>(1) Hope for smokers. People who smoke opium should know that the harm of opium is not only a great loss to personal reputation and career, but also a great impact on the country and the nation. It is hoped that smokers will regard quitting opium as the most pleasant and beneficial thing, because after the opium addiction is removed, they can restore their health and become a useful citizen. On the personal side, they will no longer be looked down upon. On the national side, they can also be revived from now on.</p>
<p>(2) Hope for planters and sellers. People who plant and sell opium should know that this kind of business is not legitimate and is illegal. Once found out, the punishment is even more severe than that of unregistered smokers. Why do you do this kind of thing that is harmful to others and not beneficial to yourself? It is hoped that you will change the land used for planting opium to planting grains as soon as possible, and that you will find other businesses for the capital used to sell opium. Do not try it lightly again and become a victim under this opium prohibition order.</p>
<p>(3) Hope for the general public. It is of course very good for people who do not smoke opium, but it is not considered to be fulfilling the responsibilities of a citizen to the fullest if they hold a principle of taking care of themselves alone and see others smoking as if it has nothing to do with them. Because whether it is a country or a society, it is made up of a majority of people. If there are too many smokers, this country and society cannot be healthy. Even if they are not directly harmed by opium, they will also be greatly affected indirectly. It is hoped that everyone will earnestly persuade relatives, friends, or related people who smoke opium. It is best to quit immediately, otherwise, persuade them to register quickly. By pooling our efforts, we can assist the government in gradually completing the important task of opium prohibition. This is the way to be a citizen.</p>
<p>Our final slogans are: 1. Opium prohibition is the best way to stop social leakage and save the poor. 2. Opium prohibition is a prerequisite for the revival of the nation. 3. Opium prohibition is an important strategy to restore international status. 4. Opium prohibition is the original plan to strengthen the country and the race. 5. Opium prohibition is the most determined and hard-working important task of the government at present. 6. Opium prohibition is the basic plan for implementing the New Life Movement. 7. It is hoped that compatriots across the country will unanimously assist the work of opium prohibition. Issued by the Shanghai Anti-Smoking Committee and the Shanghai Public Security Bureau.</p>

<p>Anti-Smoking Public Notice (for films)</p>
<p>Now the government is determined to ban opium and has set a deadline of six years to eradicate it. People who smoke opium and cannot quit temporarily should quickly go to the Municipal Public Security Bureau and its sub-bureaus to register and obtain a license. If you are determined to quit opium, you can apply to be sent to the smoking cessation hospital for treatment immediately, which will not cost you a penny. Smoking is illegal, but registering and obtaining a license can avoid penalties. Waiting and hesitating is to trap yourself in the net of law.

<h3 id="e144">A Private Morphine Manufacturing Facility Was Cracked Down in Dafu Lane, Maizhi Road. Five People, Including the Shareholding Boss, Were Arrested, and More Than One Hundred Taels of Wet and Dry Materials Were Confiscated. <a href="#e144" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c144" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">144</a></h3>
<p>Zhang Ziying, a detective from the special agency of the French Concession Police Department, learned yesterday morning that someone had privately set up a morphine manufacturing facility in the house at No. 7, Dafu Lane, No. 24 Maizhi Road, secretly manufacturing and selling it to various places, making a lot of profit. The detective reported to Inspector Jin Jiulin, and at 1:30 PM, he, together with Western detectives, led a team of detectives, including Bu Zhenglong, Xu Jinlong, Zhu Jutong, Tao Ronglin, and Zuo Qihong, rushed to the address. Seeing that the house at that number was a two-story building, they first guarded the front and back doors, and then knocked on the door and entered. The entire second floor and the pavilion were used as workplaces, equipped with several electric motors of various sizes. The workers were working hard, which was indeed a large-scale manufacturing facility. The shareholding bosses Cai Henian (from Shanghai), Cai Asheng (from Pudong), Liu Ziming (from Ningbo), the buddies Zhou Xinlai (from Ningbo), Gu Axia, and other five people were arrested on the spot, and more than one hundred taels of morphine and raw materials used for manufacturing were confiscated. It was estimated that the value of the equipment, assets, and goods of the facility was approximately more than ten thousand gold. The suspects and stolen goods were taken back to the police station for interrogation, and will be sent to the Second Special Court for trial today. Detectives were sent to guard the facility, to arrest accomplices, and craftsmen were hired to dismantle the motor parts and transport them to the police station for verification.</p>

<h3 id="e145">Shanghai Interport Tennis Shanghai Wins Championship for Four Years Yesterday Won Two More Groups, Making It Four to Zero Women's Yesterday's Match in Hong Kong Was Even. <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>In the Shanghai-Hong Kong interport tennis Taggart Cup, Shanghai won two more groups against Hong Kong yesterday, one singles and one doubles, totaling four wins for Shanghai, continuing to hold the Taggart Cup. Today's second singles match between Li Huitang and D'Orfeu is irrelevant to the championship. The Shanghai-Hong Kong interport competition has been won by Shanghai since 1931. Except for last year when there was no competition, it has won four consecutive editions. In yesterday's first women's singles match, Hong Kong won, making it an even situation. The outcome will not be known until tomorrow. The results of yesterday are recorded below:</p>
<p>Men's Group</p>
<p>Xiao Xu's Skills Still Need Improvement</p>
<p>The competition started at 1:30 PM. Qiu Feihai replaced Lin Baohua. Old Qiu has gradually recovered his original form recently, but his physical strength is still not as good as before. In the first and second sets, Qiu defeated Xu Weipei 6-1 and 6-4 respectively. In the third set, he felt exhausted and won with 12-10 with great difficulty. Xu is a rising star in Hong Kong and his skills are above Li Huitang. He was placed in the third singles to avoid the complete defeat of Hong Kong. Unexpectedly, Qiu still defeated him yesterday. Xu's skills have not improved much compared to the National Games. His ball is delivered in a chop style, flying very high and falling in an arc shape, with weak power, and his backhand is even less certain. Sometimes he is better at the net. Qiu was extremely brilliant in the first and second sets yesterday, but he was weak in the third set. Xu once caught up from 1-4 and surpassed him to 5-4. Finally, due to lack of certainty, Old Qiu won 12-10 after several ties.</p>
<p>Women's Singles Hong Kong Wins</p>
<p>Mrs. Wilson of Hong Kong is young and strong, and her skills are commendable. She is capable of all kinds of hitting techniques. Not only is the ball good, but the posture is also very beautiful. Mrs. Moore is old and not good at running, which is the main reason for her failure. The difference in age also determines the outcome. In the first set, Wilson used a ball that was sometimes near and sometimes far, winning 6-0 very easily. However, in the second set, her strength gradually felt insufficient. Mrs. Moore's cross-court shots made Wilson tired of running, and Moore regained it with 6-2. After a ten-minute break, the situation changed greatly, and Wilson regained her strength, and her brilliance reappeared, winning again with 6-1.</p>
<p>Card's Underestimation Almost Leads to Failure</p>
<p>In the final match, the first doubles, the two generals of Shanghai, had no problem winning. Moreover, this match was irrelevant to the outcome. In the first and second sets, under the swing of Card, He Jialiu and Hong Weizhao were no match at all, 6-1, 6-3. However, in one move, Carlson actually gathered his strength to defeat the enemy quickly, thinking that he could win casually. Unexpectedly, he made one mistake after another from then on. He and Hong rose steadily, winning the third set 6-1. In the fourth set, the Shanghai team was leading 5-2, and they lost four games in a row. As a result, they lost again with 7-9. At this time, Carlson knew that he could not be casual anymore, and with a little more effort, he ended with 6-2. When the match was over, dusk had already gathered, and it was time to turn on the lights. He and Hong can be proud of this achievement.</p>

<h3 id="e147">Incomplete Lineup - 2 to 1: Shanghai Loses to the Youth Team; Shanghai Takes the Lead 1-0 in the First Half; The Youth Team Wins 2-0 in the Second Half <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>The Shanghai football team participating in the All-China Games had its third practice match yesterday with the newly emerging powerhouse Youth Team at the Shen Garden. It was found that four major players of the Shanghai team, Li Ning, Jiang Shanjing, Li Yichen, and Jia Youliang, were either tied down with county affairs or unable to play due to leg injuries. Due to the need to make up numbers, Wan Xianghua played despite an injury, and Peng Qi made a temporary appearance, which resulted in the entire team seeming listless. This resulted in the Youth Team narrowly defeating Shanghai by a score of 2 to 1. The battle situation is recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Twelve-Yard Penalty and Jin Shun's First Contribution; The Silver Whistle Blows</p>
<p>The two teams set up their formations, treating each other politely and not with animosity. Therefore, the battle was uneventful. Little Wan launched an attack from the left, and Zhong Yongsen responded from the right, kicking the ball to the Youth Team's goal. Zhang Pengnian, eager to save the ball, accidentally committed a foul, resulting in a penalty kick. Jin Shun casually took the shot and drilled it into the net, opening the scoring. The Youth Team was unwilling to settle for this and attacked the goal repeatedly, resulting in two corner kicks. Unfortunately, the shots were inaccurate and came to nothing.</p>
<p>Xu Buyun Scores a Goal to Tie the Game; After Lemon Time</p>
<p>The two teams switched sides and fought again. Zhang Rongcai, trying to save a high ball, lost his footing, resulting in a free kick. Although the Youth Team directed the kick, there was too little space. Little A'dou took the opportunity to show his power, much to the delight of the fans on both sides. Soon, Liu Zuxiu intercepted a pass, picked up the pace, and drove to the center, where Xu Buyun swept the ball in, sending it like an arrow towards the goal. Zhang Rongcai was unable to save it, and the goal was lost, tying the game. This angered Lin Jing, who gave the order to his troops to launch a full-scale attack, causing chaos in front of the Youth Team's goal. Fortunately, Gu Biao's hands and feet were agile, and he missed nothing, leaving the Shanghai team empty-handed.</p>
<p>Ten Men Fight; The Short-Legged Tiger is Injured</p>
<p>Every member of the Youth Team gave their all, and everyone praised them. The Shanghai team was unable to display its power for a time. Wan Xianghua, who had made efforts, had suffered an injury during practice last week. Due to the need to make up numbers, he reluctantly played despite the injury, but he overexerted himself and was unable to continue. The Shanghai team was suddenly left short-handed. As time went on, they found it difficult to fight. Peng Qi, being tall and unable to run fast, often lost his balance and fell. Fortunately, Gu Shangli and Feng Yunyou did their best to assist him, turning danger into safety.</p>
<p>Wang Cuixing Breaks Through Three Barriers and Scores</p>
<p>The Shanghai City's left defense was weak, and Liu Zuxiu and Wang Cuixing were often able to launch a coordinated attack, creating a huge momentum. Yunyou tried his best to defend against them, but alas, one pillar could not support a collapsing building. Wang Cuixing hastily kicked the ball into the net, scoring a goal. Misfortunes never come singly; Peng Qi also touched the ball with his hand, resulting in a penalty kick. Xu Buyun was too cautious, and Rongcai blocked it into a corner kick. Afterward, the two sides fought in confusion for a long time, but neither side gained anything. The Youth Team narrowly defeated Shanghai by a score of 2 to 1. The lineups of both sides are listed below:</p>

The Shanghai team cheered up and, in the sixth inning, Liang Fuchu and Liang Chengsong each returned to home base, adding two more points. In the seventh inning, both sides maintained their chastity. In the eighth inning, Shangfang's Gao Song hit a ground ball that landed on the first base line and rolled away. The left fielder failed to catch it, and three players from Shangfang returned to home base, adding another three points. In the final inning, three players from the Shanghai team were already on base, and Yang Huayuan had a heavy responsibility. However, his luck was bad, and he failed, ending the game with a score of 3 to 12.</p>
<p>Overall Assessment of Skills</p>
<p>Overall, the skills of both sides were evenly matched. The Shanghai team's pitcher, Gan Cheng, and catcher, Gan Ruikang, and the Shangfang team's pitchers, Heiyan and Yongsong, and catcher, Mizumatsu, were all at a high level. Although neither side made any special contributions yesterday, their sharp and elusive skills were already quite advanced. The three-tier personnel were also quite well-balanced. However, the Shanghai team's outfield was too weak, missing nine out of ten high balls. For example, Gao Song's ground ball in the eighth inning was quite easy to catch, but it slipped through the fielder's legs, which was a great loss. Otherwise, only one more person from Shangfang could have returned to home base in that inning. Therefore, the reason for yesterday's defeat was that there were too many errors in the outfield. According to the hit records, Shangfang scored more points, but they had nine hits, while Shanghai also had five hits. Moreover, Zeng Ying once had a triple and Zeng Ruiqi once had a double. Shangfang only Mizumatsu had a double. This proves that the offensive power was still strong. However, the Shangfang factory is one of the local strong teams, and baseball is the national sport of the Japanese, so Shanghai's attack is not surprising. Therefore, the hope of winning the championship at the All-China Games is very high.</p>

<p>(Nanjing, 29th) Regarding the rent dispute at Peiping Republic College, the person in charge of the school said that the school building was originally the residence of Prince Chun of the Qing Dynasty. When it was leased eleven years ago, a contract was signed stating that the monthly rent was 200 yuan. After paying for one month, the payment was discontinued because the property was to be used for public purposes. After the Mukden Incident, when Prince Chun went to the puppet state, he entrusted a Japanese person to demand 25,000 yuan in unpaid rent over the past eleven years. Lu Dangping has already presented the details of the matter to Minister Wang of the Ministry of Education and requested instructions on how to handle it. For the time being, he will not go to Peiping.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Recent Educational News from Anhui Province <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>The following is a brief summary of the recent educational situation in Anhui Province:</p>
<p>(A) Elementary Education (1) "Planning for Universal Education in the Provincial Capital": The total number of out-of-school adults and children in the provincial capital has been surveyed last year. Since the adoption of various implementation measures by the Universal Education Committee, the implementation of universal education in the provincial capital has started in April and will be completed within one year. Methods such as the teaching-student service method, two-part system, short-term primary school classes, universal education classes, and universal education groups are adopted and promoted separately. It starts with persuasion, and those who do not comply with persuasion will be forced by law. Four volumes of universal education readers have been compiled, and it is stipulated that those receiving education should complete these readers and understand their meaning as the standard. The responsibility for promotion is undertaken by the provincial elementary schools in each district. (2) "Establishment of a Central Science Experiment Room for Primary Schools in the Provincial Capital": In order to enrich the scientific equipment of primary schools in the provincial capital and increase the efficiency of science teaching, the Department of Education has established a central science experiment room for primary schools in the provincial capital. The provincial primary schools in the provincial capital are planned to be divided into four districts, with one central science experiment room set up in each district, and a Science Education Committee is organized to be responsible for managing the experiment rooms and planning and guiding science teaching in each school. The Department of Education will purchase physics and chemistry instruments, medicines, and biological models and specimens and distribute them to each experiment room to facilitate teaching.</p>
<p>(B) Secondary Education (1) "Revising the Regulations for Teacher Training Students' Observation and Practice": In accordance with the regulations for teacher training schools promulgated by the Ministry, the Department of Education has recently revised the regulations for teacher training students' observation and travel that were formulated last year, in order to better suit the actual situation, and has issued them to all schools for compliance. (2) "Vocational School Graduates Are Not Allowed to Participate in Observation and Travel": In the past, vocational school students in the province used to have observation and travel activities in their last semester. Now, in accordance with the regulations, emphasis is placed on practical training, and all vocational schools are ordered not to follow the example of teacher training students in conducting observation and travel. All vocational schools have complied with this and will not conduct observation and travel this semester.</p>
<p>(C) Higher Education "Holding Examinations for Government-Funded Students to Study in Europe": The province selected and sent two government-funded students majoring in hydraulic engineering, one in electrical engineering, one in civil engineering, and two in crop breeding to study in Europe last summer. Because there are still vacancies for government-funded students to study in Europe, the Department of Education, in order to cultivate talents, held another examination this year in July to send three government-funded students to study in Europe, including one in mechanical engineering in countries such as England, Germany, France, and Belgium, one in mining and metallurgy in Germany, and one in agriculture in Germany, Denmark, and other countries.</p>
<p>(D) Social Education "Issuing Standards for Compiling Social Education Expenditure Estimates": The Department of Education stipulated that social education expenditure should account for a certain percentage of the total education expenditure, ranging from 10% to 20%, when instructed by the Ministry of Education, and ordered all counties to comply. In the 23rd year of the Republic, there were still many counties where the social education expenditure was far from the prescribed percentage. In order to expand the social education expenditure in each county, the Department of Education has specially formulated the standards and precautions for the social education expenditure to be compiled by each county in the 24th year of the Republic, and ordered all counties to pay special attention to compliance.</p>
<p>Local Education (1) "Abolishing Education Bureaus and Establishing Sections": In order to improve the efficiency of local education administration, the province has temporarily designated several counties to try abolishing the county education bureaus and establishing education sections attached to the county government. County education administrative matters are carried out in the name of the county magistrate. The county magistrate is responsible for education funding and must ensure its independence and maintenance. Under no circumstances shall it be misappropriated. The county magistrate is also responsible for increasing revenue, improving old debts and new credits. The county's education funding is managed by an education funding management committee. The original education funding committee is changed to an education funding audit committee. (2) "Custody of Education Funds in Chuzhou County": In order to manage the entire county's education fund, Anhui Province’s Chuzhou County organized the Chuzhou County Education Fund Management Committee, which is responsible for custody and auditing. This fund should account for 2% to 5% of the total county educational expenditure. The specific percentage for each year is determined by the committee. The education fund cannot be used except for one of the following circumstances: (1) Temporarily borrowing funds for essential maintenance when there is a shortage; (3) Allocating funds to maintain the status quo due to disaster and poor harvest. The education fund passbook is kept by the Education Special Fund Committee, and its seal is kept by the Chairman of the Committee for mutual supervision.</p>

<p>"They won't know, Uncle Bay is not home, Mrs. Bay is busy taking care of Tandy; he has something like a throat ailment, she can't leave him for a step, we won't sit up until late at night, and there won't be any noise, what else is preventing us?"</p>
<p>"If we leave the lamp on for too long, Assy will know, she always notices when it's like this."</p>
<p>"No, she won't, I've prepared a dark lantern for this; it won't let out much light, and we can turn it off immediately when we hear someone coming," said Don, and Ned was moved by this idea, thinking that new life was delightful. He immediately went out to inform Tomo, but then stuck his head back in and said:</p>
<p>"You want Little Bridge too, don't you?"</p>
<p>"No, I don't; if you tell that moralist, he'll stick up two crow's eyes at you, and they're already asleep, so just glance at Tomo and come back immediately."</p>
<p>Ned followed his words and came back in a moment, followed by Tomo, who was only wearing one piece of clothing, his hair disheveled, and drowsy, but just like his behavior, he was prepared to come and have fun together.</p>
<p>"Now don't be hungry, I'll teach you how to play a wonderful game called 'Poker'," said Don, at which time the three young men who knew how to have fun were already sitting around the table, on which were placed a bottle, cigars and playing cards, "Let's drink a little first, then everyone will hold a 'Weed' and play poker together, this is what adults do, it's really fun."

<h3 id="e169">Superfluous Words <a href="#e169" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c169" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">169</a></h3>
<p>— Yu</p>
<p>Let me say a few words as usual. It seems to be superfluous. A thing itself has a certain limited value. It does not need an individual's subjective, overly high or low evaluation to affirm or deny its existence. In fact, it is inevitable to fall into error to think that this partial selection is sufficient to represent everything, or insufficient to represent everything. We cannot affirm everything because of our likes and dislikes, just as we cannot deny everything because of our likes and dislikes. However, we must understand this point, that is: a thing attains the highest evaluation from society due to its objective existence, which is definitely not the advocacy of a few people, but due to the needs of the majority. Those who consider themselves masters of ××, or the founders of ××, obliterate the entire process of the occurrence of a thing—both its beginning and its development—and attribute it to the power of individuals. This is inevitable to place so much emphasis on the small ego, which is not very important, while neglecting the great ego outside oneself. This is because those who are ignorant of reality account for five out of ten, and those who are subjectively arrogant account for five out of ten. If individuals are calm and peaceful, get rid of their arrogance, and observe the actual situation clearly, they will understand that the power of individuals is truly insignificant. Once we understand this point, then we can understand that the recent development of essays—or what some people call miscellanies—is not the result of the advocacy of a particular person or a particular group, but there are objective conditions for its development. That is, the changes in modern economic institutions and the development of mechanical civilization have made everyone's daily life proceed at a high speed. People involved in this vortex, except for friends who live in pavilions, use literature as a tool for eating, or those leisurely classes who want to claim to be erudite and still read long and thick novels, most citizens no longer have such leisure. In this way, short, powerful, and stimulating essays will naturally become the best spiritual food for the general public. The development of essays is then the inevitable result.</p>
<p>Speaking of this, some people may raise objections, thinking that this situation may be true in Europe and the United States, but not necessarily in China. Chinese people have plenty of free time. In the inland areas, you can see that playing a game of mahjong will take up an entire morning, drinking a glass of wine will take up half a day, and drinking a pot of tea will take up an entire afternoon, and smoking a few pipes of opium will consume an entire lifetime. You can see laziness and slowness everywhere. Walking like ants crawling, doing things like lazy cattle proceeding. You may ask where is the high speed? Where is the tense life? However, if you take a look at the metropolis that came in with the Western cannons and the cities affected by it, you may get a clear impression. At the corners of the asphalt roads in the morning and evening, you can see that in the middle of the road, vehicles are galloping like the wind, and people are surging like a tide. A dynamic - high-speed moving city is displayed in front of you, and the people in this city, although not necessarily all living a high-speed life, the rhythm of this high speed is affecting their heads to some extent. With such a lifestyle, and with a part of the people in this lifestyle, social institutions that are suitable for this lifestyle naturally also occur. Naturally, in the city, there are special organizations for these people to consume, special entertainment venues for these people to consume, and naturally, at the same time, there must also be special spiritual food to supply these people. Yellow newspapers, "mosquito newspapers" are one kind, humorous magazines and picture magazines are another kind, and more pure magazines and newspapers are another kind. Under such circumstances, the so-called soft article has developed unprecedentedly.</p>
<p>Speaking of the special development of small magazines carrying so-called essays in China in recent years, there is another special reason for investigating its actual situation, that is, on the one hand, because the contradictions in society are becoming increasingly profound, and grasping this phenomenon, the poisonous satirical literature has become particularly prosperous, and the passive ones only "entrust sadness to humor," while the active ones naturally have a kind of edifying meaning in them. On the other hand, because of the increasing economic depression of the nation and the shrinking purchasing power of the people, buying more expensive books has become the right of special classes and is no longer within the ability of ordinary people, and no one cares about newly published books, and magazines with lower prices have become the target of mass purchases, which is an inevitable result, and the sudden rise of the magazine industry is not without reason.</p>
<p>Whether such a phenomenon is good or bad is another question, which is not within the scope of this article's discussion, but the development of essays has its own value and will never be as worthless as ordinary people scold. Similarly, the development of essays is definitely not an obstacle to the production of great works. Although we admit that the era of "Tyranny of Fiction" has passed, we cannot admit that the development of essays is the result of the exhaustion of novel themes. Koizumi Yakumo talked about this opinion decades ago. Koizumi Yakumo believes that European novels in the past two hundred years, with love as the theme, have almost exhausted all kinds of themes and forms, and future novels must find a new way. What is the new way of novels? He did not tell us, but he told us that prose (Essay) and sketch (Sketch) will definitely occupy an important position in literature in the future. Although triangular love and quadrilateral love novels have flourished for a while in China in the past few years, these novels are not enough to represent everything, and they have not exhausted the themes. Chinese novels seem to have a common new trend in the future, with a promising future, and the development of essays is actually going on in parallel. There is no need for me to defend the essays. In the near future, the facts will tell us.</p>
<p>Of course, in terms of these two natures, the writing of essays is lighter in weight, easier to write, and more free in form. The death of an old woman next door can be used as the subject matter of an essay, and a car crushing a small dog can also be used as the subject matter of an essay; essays can write about the vastness of the universe or the insignificance of flies. However, what essays are different from novels is that you only need to describe the outline of a thing with the simplest pen, which is enough. You don't need to write about half a day of a person's life with hundreds of pages of words like a novel. Just like modern cartoons, you only need to use a few strokes to depict the characteristics of a person or event vividly on paper to exhaust its function. Therefore, if you want to draw a Cyrano, you only need to draw a big nose. If you want to draw the absurd actions of the mad knight Don Quixote, you only need to draw a knight riding a skinny horse to fight windmills. If you want to draw Chaplin, you only need to draw a pair of big leather shoes or draw a cane or draw a small beard. If you want to draw Joan Crawford, you only need to draw a pair of big eyes, which is enough. I believe that those who can grasp this point will definitely be able to write a good essay, and I believe that those who ignore this point will definitely be struggling to no avail. My standard of selection is like this. Whether there are subjective errors in it is naturally open to discussion, and whether what I have selected meets this standard is naturally difficult to say.</p>

<p>— Menghua</p>
<p>Every night, after I get rid of all my duties, I walk out of the store with "body fatigue". I'm used to the dim yellow electric lights, and when I leave the store, I feel a little dizzy. I can't hear the noisy city sounds, I can't see the beautiful night street scene, I'm blank, as lonely as if I'm in a desert. I just anxiously drag this tired body into an alley, and then wipe past a few, turning, and walking towards my home.</p>
<p>I stopped outside a house with peeling paint, this is my home. I quietly knocked on the door a few times, and the old landlord came to answer the sound. The door opened, and I answered the landlord's greetings while hurrying in, opening my own room door, twisting the electric light, and sitting blankly on the chair as before.</p>
<p>At this time, I began the silent thought of home.</p>
<p>"Is this my home?" I asked myself this as if I were practicing old habits. Yes, I still have only one home, and I have been away from it for almost ten years. But once I leave it. I never think of it at any time, and what revolves in my mind is a new, future home, a happy and gentle home. There I can completely recover from the fatigue of the day and not feel any disgust or boredom.</p>
<p>"This is not the request of a selfish person, nor is it the concept of a vulgar person, even a chicken has a perch, a dog has a nest, how can a person not have a home?" I often reasoned with myself like this. So I sank again into my ocean of ideals, this ocean of our future ideals. In this way, I felt as if I was immersed in the warm spring sun, lying on the soft, grassy fields, and I felt the preciousness of life and the comfort of living.</p>
<p>However, the home where I sit by the window is a house that is both leaky and dirty. There are piles of stove ashes outside the house, and there are piles of stove ashes inside the house. There is a thick, thin layer of ashes sprinkled on the table, the desk, the bookshelf, and the bed. The light is so dim, and people are so tired. Seeing and hearing these things, I fell out of the circle of ideals in disappointment and resentment. I heard the rumbling of the trams in the up and down, the cries of those sad peddlers floating in the sea of people, as well as the cough of the landlord's chronic lung disease.</p>
<p>I am, and my thoughts turn to another dark alley.</p>
<p>"Don't I also have a mother who coughs like this all day long?" I thought. Yes, I have heard people say that. Because when I had just touched the sunlight, my mother had left me forever. In my memory, Dad's impression is also blurred, as if he was a tall, black and thin man, because he left me when I could walk, and went to other places to leave his dilapidated and unrecognizable home. So I was raised by an aunt who was cruel and vented her private anger by whipping other people's children. When I could just walk (naturally, this is a social path), I was determined and learned from my dad and ran away. For ten years, I was a homeless person. He ran away for an ideal, that was very clear, and his child also left the so-called home for an ideal, that was also very clear. But until now, none of us know where anyone is going, maybe he ended his life for that ideal? My poor dad.</p>
<p>The sound from the landlord came over again when my thoughts were interrupted, and therefore I felt even more sad.</p>
<h3 id="e171">A Story of Pigeons <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Ling He</p>
<p>I spent the entire summer relaxing with the children in the countryside.</p>
<p>Being in the countryside, I was far away from my friends. As a result, most of them had forgotten about me, and the manuscript deadlines weren't as pressing as before, so I felt much more at ease. Aside from sharing in the children's laughter and joy, I also became quite interested in the daily lives of the host's pigeons.</p>
<p>There were four pigeons in total, and the host housed them in two separate rooms. As the host told me, they were two married couples. The couple upstairs hadn't had any offspring, while the downstairs couple had already had a little one. Amidst the busyness of people's trivial lives, one could hear the little life chirping incessantly, a cry of hunger awaiting feeding. So the mother busied herself feeding the baby, taking turns with the father. Day after day passed, and slowly, one could see the little pigeon growing scattered, stiff feathers. It seemed their lives, though busy, were also peaceful and happy.</p>
<p>Pigeons, in the eyes of artists, are regarded as symbols of peace. At this time, I also understood that pigeons were indeed lovely.</p>
<p>One morning, before dawn had fully broken, I, fond of the coolness of summer mornings, got up by myself. Opening the front door, a sweet, cool breeze rushed towards me, making me feel as if my chest had suddenly expanded a lot. The bamboo leaves in the courtyard were covered in pearl-like morning dew, reluctant to fall. I deliberately walked back and forth barefoot on the grass, my feet thoroughly cleansed by the dew. In this setting, I deeply understood the loveliness of summer.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a loud whistling sound rang above my head, which also gave one a sense of clarity. It turned out to be a flock of pigeons flying by. Who knew that misfortune would begin from here? When eating lunch that day, I was the first to notice that the mother pigeon had flown away, as she wasn't there picking up rice grains by the table. All the way until dusk, it was clear that the little pigeon's mother wasn't coming back. Gone, gone, perhaps never to fly back to her husband and child. The hostess complained, saying:</p>
<p>"It's that Zhang family's big house, they really don't do good deeds. Every morning, they release their pigeons, making them coo and coo, attracting other people's pigeons. I bought this pair for two hundred coppers, and now one has gone, what a pity!"</p>
<p>I didn't dare misquote a single word of what the hostess said. After all, half of the two hundred coppers had flown away, so it was understandable that she felt pained. Moreover, I had long known that she wanted pigeons because her daughter-in-law hadn't given her any grandchildren after more than three years of marriage. After consulting with Old Lin the doctor, she was told that she needed to nourish her yin, so she bought four pigeons in two batches. She had personally told her daughter-in-law that once the little pigeons had two pairs, then she would kill the big ones for her daughter-in-law to eat alone. A mother-in-law treating her daughter-in-law with such great kindness was truly rare in the world. Not long ago, one little one hatched, which really made the hostess happy. However, now that one was born and one was lost, one canceling out the other, there was still no additional one. Naturally! Perhaps it really was her daughter-in-law's bad luck. And the mother-in-law's blaming heaven and earth had its own reasons.</p>
<p>I don't know if pigeons also understand the sorrow of lost love, but I did see that the widowed male pigeon was truly uneasy for two or three days. One moment it would fly to the roof and coo, the next it would coo beside the nest. The feathers on its neck were stretched out as much as possible, but aside from the motherless child chirping and begging its father for food, no wife paid it any attention. And the couple upstairs simply looked at it freely, seemingly without resentment or sympathy.</p>
<p>Based on my imagination, the Zhang family's big house must be a magnificent, resplendent mansion. Then the pigeon coop must also be luxurious and splendid. Of course, the pigeons' food there must be very good, so every male would have extremely beautiful plumage. In the mornings with gentle breezes, they would happily soar into the sky. With the bells tied to their feet by the owner, emitting loud sounds that resonated in the sky, how envious their fellow pigeons must be! So this young mother, breaking free from the troublesome life of raising children, leaving her simple husband, following them to the Zhang family's big house to enjoy herself, what's so unreasonable about that?</p>
<p>I don't know why, but perhaps the hatred in the world hadn't completely worn away my sympathy, and I was very concerned about that pigeon. Since losing its wife, I saw that it was even more diligent in feeding its child. It would open its beak, letting the child forcefully peck at its throat to get rice grains. It endured the pain, constantly moving backwards, while the child pressed tightly, drilling deep into its throat. Naturally, this was an unavoidable obligation for it: to feed its own child, carefully watching over it as it slowly grew up. Its wife could shirk this responsibility, but it couldn't! Could it also bear to fly far away, leaving its child to starve to death?</p>
<p>It flew outside several times each day. Perhaps it was looking for its wife, which would forever disappoint it. Otherwise, it was going outside to look for food. Indeed, the hostess sometimes generously scattered a few grains of broken rice on the ground for the pigeons, but that was so little that it could be counted. And the couple upstairs desperately fought to peck at it. No matter how quick its beak movements were, it was ultimately just a matter of evenly splitting the food. But its share had to feed itself and its child. But with its meager strength, in this desolate and cruel world, how much leftover food from humans could it find?</p>
<p>Like every animal's fondness for its own offspring, this poor father truly did his best to care for his child. It used its beak to scratch the child, comb its feathers, and peck away the gradually falling down. Seeing the shiny, black new feathers gradually growing on the child, how intense its joy must be.</p>
<p>Originally, this was also a very natural thing, feeling especially sorry for a child who has lost its mother, and caring for it doubly; perhaps this pigeon also had the same inspiration as humans, so when the male pigeon upstairs flew near its nest or stood at the entrance for a while, it would fight it with all its might, to defend it from harming its child, until it left. But when the female one upstairs came near, it didn't hit it, but rather cooed, expressing amorous frivolity, as if treating it like its lost wife. This might be a sexual reaction, but the female one ignored it and walked away, which was inevitably an embarrassing insult. Precisely because of this, it hated the male one even more, and several times I saw them fighting for no reason, falling from the high pigeon coop, feathers torn and scattered, and blood flowing.</p>
<p>I often thought this: even the god of peace fights, no wonder human wars are such natural behaviors, although they are also very terrible.</p>
<p>The child grew bigger day by day. Covered in shiny feathers, it could actually fly from the coop to the ground. But at this time, the father lost the hair on its head. The child's feathers were full, but it won itself a bald head. I selfishly pondered silently. Who was this ultimately for? It wasn't until I learned from others that the newly grown child was its daughter that I realized it was actually placing great hopes on its daughter. Later, I indeed saw it several times following behind its daughter, cooing like it did to the female one upstairs, but the daughter coldly avoided it every time. No, if the daughter didn't disappoint her, then its bald head wouldn't be without a price. I silently prayed for its wish to succeed.</p>
<p>The summer vacation passed, and I quietly returned to where I originally lived. Nearly two months in the countryside ultimately left me with a lot of memories, and the pitiful pigeon, as Hui Ru said, was also something I sometimes thought about. A letter from the countryside told me that the newly grown female pigeon had, like its mother, also flown away to an unknown place. I didn't know if I should worry about the male pigeon, but its pitiful bald head flashed in my mind several times.</p>

<p>— Original by George Bernard Shaw (Translated by Ding)</p>
<p>In the private office of a law firm, a litigant paced back and forth. They were both young men. The litigant said:</p>
<p>——No, Schatto: This separation case. I'm going to settle it right away.</p>
<p>——Listen to me, Hollis.</p>
<p>——I don't want to listen to you. Nor do I want to listen to anyone. My wife and I only have divorce as an option.</p>
<p>——But, my dear Hollis, you have nothing against her.</p>
<p>——Nothing against her…</p>
<p>——I'm telling you, since you have nothing against her. Then you shouldn't criticize her character, her housekeeping, and all the other things; except that she makes you jealous.</p>
<p>——I'm not jealous, but I can't avoid this emotion, so I should have a reason.</p>
<p>——Then, Hollis. If you separate from her based on this reason, then you already have grounds for divorce.</p>
<p>——I'm absolutely willing to divorce—I mean I want to divorce her. But you always tell me it's not possible.</p>
<p>——It's all not possible. You're not accusing her of the kind of wrongful conduct: just accusing her with words. Words aren't of much use.</p>
<p>——You still think it's not bad enough. This shows how ignorant you are about the affair. The lawyer couldn't bear it anymore and said:</p>
<p>——Hey, fine. Then do it your own way. What do you want to sue for now?</p>
<p>——What are you planning to do?</p>
<p>——Me! What? Old man, I'll drag your wife here today and tell her you've decided to separate from her. Do you think I'll do something like this without giving her a reason?</p>
<p>——I might as well tell you: No one else can tolerate it.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Fleeing the Famine <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Chengsheng</p>
<p>When a year of famine is encountered, and there is no harvest in the fields, farmers lose their livelihood. Driven by hunger and cold, and having no other choice, they apply to the local government for a passport. They travel in groups, supporting the old and leading the young, fleeing to other places to find food. This is called "fleeing the famine."</p>
<p>"Fleeing the famine" is originally something done out of necessity under circumstances where there is no other option. However, things happen unexpectedly, and there are even those who take "fleeing the famine" as a regular occupation. This is truly what is called a strange custom.</p>
<p>In Funing County, Jiangsu, there are several places where the folk customs are very fierce. They are accustomed to a life where, every year after the autumn harvest, when the farming season is over, regardless of whether the year is abundant or lean, the entire village unites and goes to the county to apply for a passport. Every family abandons the joy of home and becomes a "famine refugee" who leaves their hometown. From autumn to winter, they wander in other places, living their nomadic lives, until the next year when the spring is warm and the flowers are fragrant, when everyone returns and goes back to cultivate their own fields.</p>
<p>For example, if there is a family in this village who feels that their harvest is sufficient for their livelihood and is unwilling to go outside to "flee the famine" with them, that is not allowed. Then, everyone in the village will first come to your house to eat, eating everything you have until it is completely gone. In the end, you still have to go "fleeing the famine" with them. Therefore, farmers who have a little bit of food have long since moved away.</p>
<p>Every year during the autumn harvest season, the Funing County government routinely prepares a certain number of passports, waiting for them to request them. It has almost become a formulaic task. The government has no way to stop this strange custom, otherwise, if they don't go out to "flee the famine," they will cause trouble in the local area.</p>
<h3 id="e175">A Record of Rock Piling in Guyi Garden, Nanxiang <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Haiyang Yuyin</p>
<p>Since ancient times, the best scenery in famous gardens has been trees and rocks, and the rise and fall of fortune also depends on trees and rocks. Lush trees are a sign of prosperity; dilapidated rocks are a sign of decline. Rocks are the natural essence of heaven and earth, called cloud roots. Rocks with essence are called spiritual rocks, and rocks without essence are called stubborn rocks. In the past, Shengong lectured on the Dharma, and stubborn rocks nodded. Chuping attained enlightenment and scolded rocks to become sheep. It can be seen that rocks do have spiritual essence. During the Qianlong period of the Qing Dynasty, Ye rebuilt Guyi Garden and piled up artificial mountains such as Douyun Cave, the Five Elders Peak, and the Eighteen Scholars, which were quite spectacular. During the Red Sheep Calamity in the Xianfeng and Tongzhi period, they were already destroyed. During the January 28th Incident, they were further ravaged. Visitors to the garden deeply regretted this. Chuan Zuohong, a gentleman from Puzuo, saw this and hired a Jinhua technician to estimate the cost of repairs. Li Liangcai tried his best to raise funds, and noble gentlemen generously donated. Construction began in mid-July of the year Yihai and was completed in early August. The Douyun Cave has steps that can be climbed, winding into the cave. Mr. Dai Cangyan inscribed "Little Tiantai," and the Eighteen Scholars, Five Elders Peak, and Wanjuanshu Rock were restored to their former appearance. They are even more majestic and magnificent. Su Shi of Meishan said: The rise and fall, prosperity and destruction of things cannot be known. Today's beautiful trees and spiritual rocks, how long will it be before they are buried in desolate smoke and weeds? It is also impossible to know. However, with those who fall forward being followed by those who rise up behind, never changing, although they have gone through ancient times, they are like new. May this garden be immortal.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Watching the Tide Under the Moon <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— (Sun Linchang)</p>
<p>The tide of Haining is a marvel that shocks China and the world. The time of the tide is relative to noon and midnight, so if there is a daytime tide, there must be a nighttime tide, and the nighttime tide is often more magnificent than the daytime tide. However, people only value daytime viewing and rarely watch at night. Little do they know that at midnight, "the moon hangs in the sky, the waves are calm and silent, and the flowing water swallows the light of the moon," which is a unique spectacle. Before long, the wind turns cold, and the sea gate rises with the tide. The moonlight and waves spray snow from afar, the clouds move the jade shore, and the waves roll with the sound of thunder, like a white silk sail rising in the wind, flying and twisting, with the force of breaking bamboo. The ancients said: "The sound of a hundred thousand troops is like the midnight tide," truly so. Watching the night tide is even more spectacular because the bright moonlight reflects the surging snow waves. However, the construction of the Haining coast is very rudimentary. Although people have the refined interest of watching the night tide, they have to retreat due to the lack of lodging. It is now said that the Hangzhou Provincial Highway Bureau, in view of this, has specially set up a temporary hostel by the river, located on the seawall, facing the river tide, with a particularly novel arrangement, for people who watch the night tide to linger.</p>

<p>Chapter 19: Mr. Yue Cherishes His Reputation, Knows How to Knock on Doors, Fresh Love Separates from Flesh and Blood, No Way to Visit the Sick</p>
<p>Yueying wailed and crouched in the corner of the wall, crying. Duocai said: This slut is really hateful, she's crying again. Yesterday, your crying alarmed the guests upstairs, and they were about to kick us out. It's really annoying! Not to mention others, even I can't stand you. Shilian saw one person crouching in the corner of the wall, facing away from everyone. The other had a sour face and was facing out the door, also facing away from everyone. He was standing in the middle, which was really pointless. Fortunately, there were cigarettes on the table, so he took one and smoked to make conversation. While smoking, he couldn't help but steal glances at the two. This is what he saw: Jia Duocai was very tough, but he kept looking at Yueying. Naturally, he still had feelings for her. As long as Yueying didn't cry, Duocai would definitely still like her. It seemed the cosmetics weren't given away for nothing. Wasn't he planning to force them? Why wasn't he proceeding? So he took two steps closer and bowed slightly to Duocai, smiling, "Brother Duocai, I think there's a misunderstanding on both sides in this matter. Our new sister-in-law is too young, she doesn't know how much you love her, and she can't bear to leave you for a moment. You, on the other hand, didn't realize she's too young and still a child. So you can't help but get angry, and she can't help but cry. This is easy to handle, I have a way to take care of both sides." Duocai turned his head to look at him and asked, "What way do you have to take care of both sides?" After saying this, he turned his head back. It seemed he didn't care much about his suggestion. Yueying paid even less attention, still crouching in the corner of the wall. (328)</p>
<h3 id="e178">Records of Lingering Fragrance <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Originally written by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>In the past, wealthy families were always very particular about drinking tea. The best tea leaves had to be bought for one or two taels of silver per pound, which was indeed a luxury. Because it was a luxury, our Empress Dowager particularly enjoyed using it. Whether the tea she drank was really better than all the others, I dare not say, I only know that their prices were very alarming, at least one or two taels of silver could buy one or two catties. Every time the Empress Dowager drank tea, she had to change the tea leaves, and she also liked to mix various dried flowers, such as roses and jasmine, with the tea leaves and brew them together, taking their fragrance. Among them, wild lilyturf flowers were particularly praised by the Empress Dowager. There were almost always a few wild lilyturf flowers floating in her teacup every time she drank.</p>
<p>Lotus petals were also something the Empress Dowager loved to eat. In the summer, the imperial kitchen was often instructed to pick many fresh lotus flowers, take the most intact petals, soak them in flour mixed with chicken eggs, divide them into sweet and salty, add some chicken broth or refined sugar, and fry them in a wok until golden brown, making a very palatable snack. Also, in the spring, around the time of the Qingming Festival, when the tall magnolia flowers were in full bloom, the Empress Dowager would also have them picked, and following the method of using lotus flowers, fry them into fragrant, sweet, and crispy magnolia slices, eating them at any time to pass the time.</p>
<p>Since there were so many flowers and trees planted in the imperial garden, and each flower and tree had to be taken care of at all times, the work of the eunuchs who served as gardeners for the Empress Dowager was really very arduous! Just taking chrysanthemums as an example, they are only seasonal flowers, and only need to be taken care of in the autumn. Although we have a large greenhouse to cover them, and we can keep them until winter, most of the time that they need to be taken care of is in the autumn. It seems like it shouldn't be too busy.

<h3 id="e179">The Protector of Royalty <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Blue</p>
<p>The emperors or leaders of various countries in the world are often the center of attention. Wherever they go, thousands of eyes are fixed upon them, as if they were the target of public criticism. In continental Europe, whenever emperors or crown princes travel, they are always surrounded by numerous military police, detectives, and plainclothes detectives, who protect them at all times and in all places, otherwise they would be suspicious and unable to move an inch. If they attend any public ceremony, it is even more tense, as if every step is fraught with thorns and every place is full of danger. However, royalty in England enjoys great freedom. Even if emperors of other countries, due to revolutionary upheavals in their own nations, flee in disgrace and are pursued by political assassins, they often regard England as their only haven of peace and happiness. For example, after the abdication of the former King Alfonso of Spain, he also lived as a foreign resident in England. He could openly watch horse races or play ball games in restaurants, enjoying such freedom and ease. He felt that there was no safer place in the world than England.</p>
<p>However, unexpected events may occur, so British detectives also do their best to protect royalty. The world-famous Scotland Yard has a special section dedicated to protecting royalty or leaders such as presidents from other countries. Whenever these state guests step off the train at Victoria Station, Scotland Yard detectives secretly follow them.</p>
<p>The royalty of England do not need protection. They can come and go as they please, without fear of any danger, because they are all loved by the people. People often see young princes going to the cinema to watch movies, dining in restaurants, or spending their leisure time in public dance halls, pleasures that princes on the continent cannot enjoy. As soon as they leave the palace gates, they are always escorted by troops and followed closely by military officers, as if they were being escorted as criminals.</p>
<p>The princes of England are not only unguarded in their own country, but they are also casual and carefree when they go abroad, without fear of unexpected attacks. Once, Duke Grosvenor, the prince, took a mail ship to Eton. There were many Indians among the passengers on board, who were very noisy. At that time, the ship received a wireless message stating that there had been a major strike and boycott of British goods in Bombay, India, which had led to clashes with the police. Upon hearing this news, the Indian youths on board were filled with excitement. However, the Duke remained calm and strolled on the deck, swam in the swimming pool, or played various games, without any worries. He did not even guard against an attack by the Indians.</p>
<p>During the unstable period in Egypt, assassins roamed everywhere, but the eldest prince of Wales, the British heir, calmly paraded through the streets of Cairo. He did not carry any weapons for self-defense, only a golf club.</p>
<p>Of course, covert protection is indispensable. Whenever the Prince of Wales mingles with ordinary people, there is often a broad-shouldered and powerful man following him from a distance, fulfilling his responsibility to protect him. This man's name is White, formerly a famous detective at Scotland Yard, who is also famous for protecting royalty. White is always loyal to the Prince of Wales, never slacking. Wherever the prince goes, he goes, truly like his shadow, and his comings and goings are elusive, with a mysterious meaning. The prince has used various methods to test White's skills, which are indeed as sharp as a police dog. The prince always talks about it with great relish when he is with his brothers.</p>
<p>Whenever the prince goes to the cinema to watch a movie, White is always in the back row of seats. If the prince finishes his last cigarette, White will come up and offer him a pack of his favorite cigarettes. If the prince goes down a coal mine, to the darkest depths, White has already brought a lantern and caught up. If the prince goes to the St. Andrews golf course, White is already there waiting with a golf club. The prince has tried everything to get rid of White, but rarely succeeds.</p>
<p>Even if the prince uses flight as a method, he cannot escape White. He has already received the news and taken another plane first. When the prince steps down from his plane, it is White who is holding his arm at the door. White's two broad shoulders almost bear the safety of the prince's entire body.</p>

<h3 id="e180">The Tax Burden of the Chinese People <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— (Zhao Chaogou)</p>
<p>I. The People's Ability to Bear Taxes</p>
<p>To make up for a country's financial shortfall, there are only two options: (1) issuing public debt, and (2) increasing taxes. When public debt reaches its limit, the focus turns to increasing taxes. However, increasing taxes results in increasing the burden on the people. Therefore, regardless of whether the tax system is good or bad, it is necessary to examine whether the people have the ability to pay taxes. If the people's burden has already reached its maximum limit, increasing taxes becomes even more dangerous. Historically, the core of tax discussion has been (1) how far can taxes be increased, and (2) can the people bear the maximum level of taxation. In the past, there was a school of optimistic heavy tax proponents who believed that only heavy taxes could lead the country to prosperity. There was also a school of thought on currency circulation, which believed that taxes were merely a reduction in currency circulation and would not cause much sacrifice to the people. However, neither of these theories has gained general sympathy. Based on common sense, the theory of light taxes is more likely to resonate with the general public. However, blindly believing in the theory of light taxes is also dangerous. The more a country evolves, the more diverse the duties borne by the government, and its expenditure naturally gradually expands. Without adequate income, how can the government fulfill its duties? Therefore, modern economists neither advocate the heavy tax theory, which speaks from the government's point of view, nor the populist and family-pleasing total tax theory. They all have a consensus: to determine the amount of taxes the country levies on the people based on the people's ability to pay taxes. The attention of financial economists to taxation theory is based on this fair concept. For example, after the end of the European War, the Allied Reparations Committee, when deciding on the total amount of German reparations, examined the German tax system and compared the burden on the German people with the burden on the Allied people to determine Germany's ability to pay reparations.</p>
<p>II. National Wealth, Income, and Tax-Bearing Capacity</p>
<p>National wealth and national income are mostly hypothetical figures, and naturally cannot be considered precise. However, on the whole, they are still a standard for measuring the people's ability to bear burdens. According to the economic principles of taxation, the amount of taxes that a country levies on its people must never erode national wealth, but can only be taken from national income. Therefore, national wealth and national income are of great importance to the ability to bear taxes. In the tax systems of modern countries, both property tax and income tax are listed. These two taxes both take property and income as the direct objects of taxation, and the amount of tax is directly determined by the amount of national wealth and national income. In essence, all taxes are, in a broad sense, income taxes, because no matter what kind of tax is collected, it is all drawn from the people's income. Therefore, to measure the people's ability to bear burdens, national income can be used as a direct standard, and national wealth as an indirect standard. The following is a list of the national wealth of various countries for comparison with China's national wealth. (The unit of the numbers in the table below is million Japanese yen for the top row, and Japanese yen per capita for the bottom row.)</p>
<p>Comparison of National Wealth of Various Countries</p>
<p>National Wealth  Average Wealth</p>
<p>per Capita</p>
<p>United States 762,356  6,707</p>
<p>United Kingdom 136,320  5,147</p>
<p>France  103,320  2,549</p>
<p>Japan  102,353  1,721</p>
<p>National Wealth  Average Wealth</p>
<p>per Capita</p>
<p>Germany  71,685  1,141</p>
<p>Italy  44,786  1,027</p>
<p>China  38,296  90</p>
<p>The above table is copied from "A List of National Conditions of Various Countries" published by the Japan Cabinet Statistics Bureau. The figure for China's national wealth is noted as being from a 1922 survey. Looking at this table, the difference between China and the major powers in national wealth is astounding. The average wealth per capita is more than 73 times less than that of the United States, more than 59 times less than that of the United Kingdom, and even nearly 20 times less than that of its eastern neighbor, Japan. The ability of the Chinese people to bear taxes can also be compared with that of other countries in proportion to this difference in magnitude. In other words, if the Japanese people can only bear 20 yuan in taxes per year, then the Chinese people can only bear 2 yuan per year, and the American people can bear 40 yuan. This certainly cannot be taken as an exact proportion, but it can give a glimpse of the weakness of the Chinese people's ability to bear taxes.</p>
<p>The weakness of the Chinese people's ability to bear burdens can also be seen by comparing their average national income with their tax burden.</p>
<p>Comparison of Average Income of People in Various Countries</p>
<p>The figure for the average income of the Chinese people, although an estimate by the Japanese Takahashi Hideomi, is certainly not precise. However, in the current situation, compared with 1922, after repeated military disasters and banditry, the national income of the Chinese people has only decreased, and certainly has not increased compared to before. This can be determined by common sense. There are no domestic statistics on the average figure for the tax burden of the Chinese people, but judging from various scattered statistics, there is only a tendency to increase, and no decrease. Taking the burden on farmers alone, according to the statistics of 678 counties in 16 provinces by the Central Agricultural Experimental Institute, the tax rates for paddy fields and dry land in various provinces are as follows:</p>
<p>According to informal surveys, Chen Hansheng estimates that the burden of land tax on Chinese farmers accounts for at least 5% of their total income. According to Feng Jie's "Research on Chinese Land Tax," in the affluent areas of southern Jiangsu, taking Wuxi as an example, land tax accounts for 11% of total income, and in Guangdong and Fujian, land tax accounts for more than 14% of total income. As for the civil war areas of Sichuan and Guizhou, land tax even exceeds total income. In the annual total income of farmers, in addition to the cost of cultivation, plus the burden of land tax, as well as the commodity tax on agricultural products, and the tax shifted to consumer goods, what net income is left? According to Wagner, a German, in 1925 statistics on land tax in various counties of Shandong, and Shen Shanwei's statistics on land tax in various counties of Zhejiang, the burden on farmers is compared with that of farmers in various countries as follows:</p>
<p>The burden on Shandong farmers is:</p>
<p>Four times higher than that of American farmers in 1922</p>
<p>One and a half times higher than that of Indian farmers in 1924</p>
<p>The burden on Zhejiang farmers is:</p>
<p>Sixty times higher than that of Prussian farmers in 1866</p>
<p>Eighteen times higher than that of American farmers in 1920</p>
<p>Eight times higher than that of Japanese farmers in 1931</p>
<p>Since farmers account for the majority of the Chinese population, the high level of burden on farmers fully reflects the extraordinarily heavy tax burden on the Chinese people, and the weakness of their ability to bear burdens in the future. In the tax burden of various countries, industry and commerce also occupy a major position, but in China today, the ability of industry and commerce to bear taxes is also very limited. First, because of the economic bankruptcy of the inland and the reduction of purchasing power, increasing the tax burden on industry and commerce further narrows the market for manufactured goods. Second, China's industry and commerce are currently under heavy pressure from foreign industry and commerce. Increasing the burden on Chinese industry and commerce is tantamount to assisting a tyrant. There is no need to waste words explaining these two points. Just look at the decline of China's new-style industries such as cotton spinning, matches, and cigarettes after the recent increase in consolidated taxes, and it can be seen that industry and commerce have lost their ability to bear taxes.</p>
<p>Let us further observe the income situation of the middle class and salaried class in general Chinese cities and compare it with that of other countries. We can then know that their ability to bear taxes is as weak as that of other classes. The table below is a detailed survey by the International Labor Bureau between 1920 and 1929. The statistics are relatively reliable. The figures for the Chinese part are based on half-year household accounts from 48 families in Beiping, and the survey period was 1926.</p>
<p>Average Number of People in a Family and Monthly Income</p>
<p>(Content of Expenditure, Total Expenditure Equals 100)</p>
<p>According to the first table, it can be seen that the income of the lower middle class and the salaried working class in Chinese cities is very small. According to the second table, the economic situation of the average Chinese family is pathetic. Compared with other countries, income is the lowest, and food expenses account for the largest proportion of expenditure. According to Engel's Law in economics, the poorer the person, the greater the proportion of their food expenses. The life of the average Chinese person is in line with this statement. They have no ability to enjoy the entertainment, education, and life that other civilized people should have. Do they still have the ability to bear a heavier tax burden?</p>
<p>III. Fiscal Expenditure and the People's Ability to Bear Taxes</p>
<p>As mentioned above, although the people bear the same amount of tax, the degree of sacrifice may not be the same. When measuring the people's ability to bear taxes, in addition to considering the country's national wealth and the people's income, it is also necessary to pay attention to the actual situation of finance. The main points are two:</p>
<p>First, it is necessary to pay attention to the situation of national expenditure. If the expenditure is used for production, then the taxes currently collected can still flow into the economic sector, support production undertakings, and cultivate future sources of tax revenue. This can increase national wealth and the people's income. Although the people bear taxes, they will not suffer major sacrifices. This type of expenditure is called the "tax circulation effect" by economists, and the people can afford it. Conversely, if the expenditure is used for wasteful undertakings or undertakings not directly related to production, then the tax circulation effect is completely stopped, and the people only feel the pain of sacrifice. In reality, it destroys the people's ability to bear burdens.</p>
<p>Comparing China with various countries, there is almost a common situation in expenditure, which is the huge amount of military expenditure and debt expenditure. These two types of expenditure are both non-productive. The huge amount of China's military expenditure and debt expenditure is due to the unsettled civil strife. The huge amount of military expenditure and debt expenditure in various countries is partly the result of the European War, and partly the preparation for current national defense. In terms of the meaning of expenditure, it is quite different. The following table lists the percentage of military expenditure and debt expenditure in various countries for comparison.</p>
<p>Percentage of Military Expenditure and Debt Expenditure in Total Expenditure of Various Countries</p>
<p>Note: This table is taken from the "List of National Conditions of Various Countries" compiled by the Japan Cabinet Statistics Bureau. The Chinese figures are calculated from the 1933 budget.</p>
<p>From the above table, it can be seen that although the huge amount of military expenditure and debt expenditure is a common phenomenon in various countries, it is actually the most serious in China. In other words, although China's economy is backward and the people are poor, its non-productive expenditure on finance is the highest among all countries.</p>
<p>Regarding the methods of developing industry and supporting production, in addition to adopting policies on tariffs and exchange rates to protect domestic products, various countries also try to protect them from the aspects of transportation. China is currently completely unable to talk about these things. In the budget items, the national business expenses and construction expenses can barely be called productive expenditures, but the construction is biased towards highways, and the military nature is more important than the economic nature. Although state-owned enterprises belong to productive expenditures, they have little direct benefit to the people's industry today. If we look back at various countries, in addition to the construction of state-owned enterprises being the responsibility of the government, the annual expenditure is not counted, and the subsidy and bonus for private enterprises by the government alone has reached the following figures:</p>
<p>Percentage of Industrial Subsidy Expenditure and Total Expenditure in Various Countries</p>
<p>Note… This table is recorded from (League of Nations)</p>
<p>Statistical Year-book</p>
<p>The current general industry in China is oppressed by the capital goods of the great powers from the outside, and affected by the bankruptcy of the rural areas from the inside, and has entered a period of collapse. If the burden is continuously increased, (please refer to Yin Boduan's short criticism of the 1934 fiscal facilities in the first issue of this newspaper), it will directly make various industries unable to reproduce, which is no different from killing the chicken to get the egg. If this continues, not only will the sacrifice of the people increase day by day, but the government's tax revenue will also run out one day. The simultaneous sharp reduction in the customs, salt, and unified taxes last year in July, August, and September proves that the people's tax burden has reached its limit, and even if the tax rate is increased, it may not be able to collect enough taxes in proportion to the increase in the rate.</p>
<p>(IV) Fiscal Expenditure and People's Income</p>
<p>There is a kind of fiscal expenditure that can be regarded as the people's quasi-income, and it is also very related to the people's ability to bear taxes. This kind of expenditure in various countries is the three kinds of expenses for culture, education, health, and social facilities, and in China, there is only culture and education expenses. The greater the expenditure of these kinds of expenses, the greater the profit enjoyed by the people, which can reduce the people's own consumption burden on this kind of emotion, which is equivalent to the people's income in invisible form. The less the expenditure of this kind of expenses, the greater the education, health, and social undertaking expenses borne by the people themselves, which is equivalent to the people's expenditure in invisible form. Therefore, although the people's tax burden is heavy, if the government can increase the expenditure on this kind of expenses, the degree of sacrifice of the people can also be reduced, and it will not hinder the people's ability to bear taxes.</p>
<p>In addition, the government's pension for the people is also a kind of income for the people. If this kind of expenditure is more, it can certainly increase the welfare of the people. Due to this kind of expenditure, increasing tax revenue will not only fail to increase the degree of sacrifice of the general people, but also stabilize social order and equalize the distribution of the people's wealth. The following table compares this kind of expenditure between China and various countries.</p>
<p>Percentage of Social Expenses and Fiscal Expenditure in Various Countries</p>
<p>Percentage of Pension Expenditure and Fiscal Expenditure in Various Countries</p>
<p>From the comparison in the above table, it can be seen that the ratio of the current financial expenditure in our country that is truly used for the people is very low. As a result, the wealth of society enters the national treasury, and there is no hope of return. The people's sacrifice of paying taxes does not get corresponding compensation. They also have no ability to enjoy the life of cultural people, and have to fall into the stage of poverty, illness, ignorance, and weakness.</p>
<p>Otherwise, the expenditure of national expenses, although there is a difference between productive and non-productive, there is actually no absolute boundary. Non-productive expenditure can sometimes indirectly support production and increase the people's income. For example, the expenditure of expenses in various countries is mostly still in the country, that is, the increase in military expenditure is actually a wasteful nature, and it is also enough to stimulate the prosperity of the domestic heavy industry, thus solving the unemployment problem of some. After our country's industry, heavy industry has not yet reached the point of self-sufficiency. Among the military expenditure, the expenses for the replenishment of new-style machinery and military supplies, aviation construction, etc., are all spent abroad, and there is little benefit to the domestic economy. The construction of public roads belongs to productive expenditure, but the development of roads today is only enough to promote the consumption of Far East kerosene, and this kind of expenditure is actually spent abroad. Since our country's exports are not enough to offset imports, this part of the expenditure is equivalent to the loss of national wealth, which is also a major reason for weakening the economic tax power of the people.</p>
<p>V. Tax System and the People's Ability to Bear Taxes</p>
<p>The tax system is also sufficient to affect the people's tax power. The national tax principle should take the people's tax bearing ability as the standard. If the burden of Wu's tax falls on the heads of the hard-working people, the result is to increase the degree of sacrifice of the people. For the wealthy class, more tax amount, its degree of sacrifice can be reported. Therefore, the same amount of tax also has different effects depending on the source of the tax. In theory, direct taxes are better than indirect taxes, and income taxes are better than consumption taxes. Because the burden of direct taxes is fixed and cannot be shifted, those who pay indirect taxes can shift their tax amount to the poor people. Income tax takes the people's income as the tax standard, which can be suitable for the people's tax bearing ability. Consumption tax. Tax on the property consumed by the people. The burden of tax on the poor should not be consistent with their tax bearing ability. The tax is the income tax imposed on specified income of individuals or corporation and cannot be transferred that is direct tax. Consumption taxes are imposed on consumer goods before they reach the consumers, and finally shifted to the consumers, so they are indirect taxes. In modern countries, direct taxes are becoming more and more important, while our country's taxes rely solely on indirect taxes. The disadvantages of this have been discussed by all wise men, and there is no need to repeat them here. This article only lists the percentage of direct taxes and indirect taxes in the tax revenue of China and foreign countries for comparison.</p>
<p>Percentage of Direct Taxes and Indirect Taxes in the Annual Income of Various Countries</p>
<p>Note… Copied from Statistical Year-Book League of Nation</p>
<p>It is found that the tax revenue in our country is mainly customs, salt, and three taxes, and these three taxes are all consumption taxes. Consumption taxes are not necessarily bad in themselves, but our country's consumption taxes are completely unreasonable. One of the most important principles of consumption tax is to tax luxury goods and exempt daily necessities. Because the poorer the people, the greater the proportion of daily necessities in their consumption expenditure, and the wealthier the people, the smaller the proportion of daily necessities in their consumption expenditure. In order to adapt to the tax power, daily necessities should be exempt from tax. However, in our country's tax revenue, salt tax accounts for more than 20%, and the burden of salt tax almost all falls on the poor. Other indirect taxes, such as customs and unified taxes, are almost all shifted to the common people, and the bureaucrats, rich, and wealthy who sit on their assets bear very little tax.</p>
<p>VI. Tax Situation of Our Country's People</p>
<p>Based on the above observations, although we have not been able to provide an accurate figure to express the tax situation of our country's people, we can obtain a concept of the tax situation of the Chinese people by observing the national wealth, the people's income, fiscal expenditure, and tax system of our country as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Judging from the national wealth and national income, the tax bearing ability of our country's people is lower than that of any country.</p>
<p>(2) Judging from our country's financial expenditure, the government takes more from the people and uses less for the people. There is more non-productive expenditure and less productive expenditure, and the amount spent abroad is not small. Therefore, the people only have sacrifices and get little compensation. The wealth is gradually lost, the source of tax revenue is not cultivated, and the tax bearing ability is gradually reduced.</p>
<p>(3) Judging from the government's debt expenditure, a country collects taxes from the general people every year, and almost one-third of it is used to repay debts, which is no different from sacrificing the wealth of the whole country to support a small number of financial capitalists. Such expenditure not only cannot equalize the distribution of the people's wealth, but also promotes the phenomenon of unequal distribution, and makes the living standard of the majority of people more and more low.</p>
<p>(4) But judging from the content of the tax revenue, the government imposes limited taxes on the wealthy class who have tax ability, and most of the taxes are consumption taxes that can be shifted to the poor.</p>
<p>Indeed, the tax limit of a country's people is flexible. In addition to the material conditions, there are only mental conditions and the background of the times. The sacrifice that cannot be tolerated in peacetime may be tolerated during the national crisis. But to make the people tolerate this sacrifice, the Kuomintang must be able to recognize the meaning of the country and its own responsibilities: (2) the country's tax system must be fair, so that the people have no complaints, (3) and especially the tax burden must not invade the people's minimum living standard. With the low level of knowledge of our country's people, the unfairness of the tax system, and the hardship of the people's lives, there is still no talk of this kind of mental condition.</p>
<p>VII. Observation Method of Tax Limit</p>
<p>In short, the people's tax power is limited. If it exceeds this limit, the people's sacrifice will be too heavy, and it will induce the general economic decline. And the national tax revenue will also flash the phenomenon of tax regression. However, the measurement of the tax burden power cannot be determined solely by the amount of people's income and tax amount. It is also necessary to consider the direction of fiscal expenditure and the content of tax revenue. Because of this kind of comprehensive relationship, it is almost impossible to judge the exact number of the people's tax power limit in advance. However, after reaching the tax power limit, it can naturally be significantly reflected in the general economic world. Our country's economic status is the opposite proof that the people's tax power has reached the highest limit. We" judge whether the people's tax has reached the highest limit afterwards, we can imitate the "German Prosperity Index" made by Xiaowei, and make a Chinese prosperity index without specific number measurement. The materials on which the Daweisi prosperity index is based are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The total amount of national elm exports, (the decline in exports indicates a decrease in international income, and the decline in imports indicates a recession in domestic purchasing power.)</p>
<p>(2) The ratio of the amount of tax revenue to the increase or decrease in the tax rate. (The increase in taxes, the increase in tax revenue can increase in the same proportion, the customs indicate that the people's tax power has reached the limit, so the phenomenon of tax revenue regression occurs.)</p>
<p>(3) The transport volume of railways and ships. (The decrease in transportation indicates the stagnation of commodity communication, and the failure of mountain construction.) (4) The content of expenditure. (The increase in sleeve subsidies, pension money, and relief expenses indicates that the people are exhausted and the income is reduced.)</p>
<p>(4) The consumption of cigarettes, alcohol, sugar, and coal, and the total amount paid by consumers. (Due to the increase or decrease in the consumption of daily necessities and hobbies, and the prices of these goods, it is possible to observe the prosperity or yin of the people's lives.)</p>
<p>(6) National current statistics, birth statistics, death statistics, and people's mobile statistics, (Due to the changes in the population, it can be indirectly proved by the general economic situation, for example, the increase in the number of farmers leaving the village is the result of the heavy burden of the rural areas.)</p>
<p>(7) The average amount of salt per person. The increase or decrease in the ratio of school-age children to out-of-school children. (These are all side materials for inferring the people's living conditions).</p>
<p>In short, if the collection of tax exceeds a certain limit, the finance and economy will begin to decline at the same time. The decline in finance is the cumulative reduction in tax revenue, and the decline in economy is shown in the reduction in domestic industry and foreign trade, which simultaneously affects the people's consumption life. After a certain period of time, it will disturb the natural increase rate and marriage rate of the population. The use of the prosperity index is to reflect this comprehensive phenomenon. However, this method can only be used as a tool for post-event research and cannot be used for pre-event judgment. The tax power limit is silent and odorless. The responsibility of the financial authorities is to be cautious and careful in advance, and to consider good financial policies, so that the tax burden does not exceed the limit. If you do not work hard to prevent it in advance, and wait until a hundred diseases occur before trying to remedy it, it will be laborious. Even if the remedy is good, it will be burned. Our country's current finances cannot issue more public debt, and it is not easy to increase taxes. To find a way out, we must carefully consider it from all aspects. 1935, 5, 19. At Chaobao Hall</p>

<p>Last week, the bond market experienced: On Monday, Roth reached Shanghai, and market prices weakened, gradually showing signs of short squeezing. Troop reduction was at a small four and a half, Tuesday was the last day of September futures, news from Italy and Albania was unfavorable, and the troop reduction and short squeeze were even more severe, with a sharp drop of seven and a half. The rest also continued to weaken in unison. On Wednesday, only October futures were traded, and the one-month transaction was extremely light, setting a new record for the lowest actual transaction volume. Naturally, market prices did not rise or fall. On Thursday, November futures were auctioned, but transactions still did not improve. However, the 96 trading was relatively lively, and market prices still fluctuated between five fen and one jiao. Friday was the closing day for September futures, and the market was closed. On Saturday, various unfounded rumors suddenly arose, and short sellers were very active, leading to a sharp decline. The 96 also broke the 80-yuan mark, with turbulent waves, the largest fluctuation in nearly two months. Issues such as 6, 14, 16, and 33 were heavily sold, and retail investors cutting losses were also very active, with a sharp drop of half a yuan to one yuan and three or four jiao. People's sentiment was unanimously bearish, and the financial sector also mostly sold off. Market price fluctuations were often difficult to calm down temporarily. As a result of last week's market prices, the total declined, with drops ranging from several jiao to one and a half yuan. The total transaction volume was 55,570,200 yuan. The results of the gains and losses are compared in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: bai yuan).</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened, with each month rising one to five points. In the early morning, due to good news from Liverpool, the same amount was bought. The Florida coastline had a storm, and prices were firm. Then, due to increased hedging sales and profit-taking by bulls, it fell back. October futures, due to buying by large spot cotton dealers, exceeded the market price of December futures. Finally, short positions were slightly covered, remaining relatively stable. Spot prices remained unchanged, while futures rose or fell one to three points. English cotton spot prices fell five points, and futures fell one to three points. Indian cotton retail investors and European exporters bought, overturning speculative selling. Plainfield and Ormra fell half a rupee, and White Raw Creek fell three-quarters of a rupee.

<p>— Notes by Nie Zhinong and Wang Mingding</p>
<p>——Lecture by Dr. Zeng Guangfang, Doctor of Pharmacy——</p>
<p>Currently, Mr. Zeng Guangfang, Director of Medicinal Botany at the Shanghai Institute of Natural Sciences, is a well-known chemist and pharmacologist in the country. He has used chemical methods to analyze and verify Chinese medicines for more than ten years. This lecture is based on his scientific methods over the past ten years to research the experience and insights gained from Chinese Materia Medica. There are many original ideas, I hope the Chinese people pay attention to it.</p>
<p>Recorded by the reporter at Southeast Medical College</p>
<p>(1) Preface (2) Origin of Materia Medica (3) Materia Medica during the Tang and Song Dynasties (4) Materia Medica during the Ming and Qing Dynasties (5) Types of Materia Medica medicines (6) Ingredients of Materia Medica medicines (7) Materia Medica medicines that have undergone scientific research (8) Conclusion</p>
<p>Preface</p>
<p>Today, I am very honored that everyone has come to my office to listen to the lecture.</p>
<p>The research on Materia Medica is very broad. I will now do my best to guide the research and use of my country's existing medicinal materials and Chinese medicine Materia Medica onto a scientific path. Therefore, I would like to discuss this matter today.</p>
<p>From a historical perspective: As early as two or three thousand years ago, there was the fact that Materia Medica was used for treatment; and the name Materia Medica means medicine. It includes three types: animals, plants and minerals. However, at that time, most of the things used to treat diseases were grass roots and tree bark. Therefore: at that time, the word Materia Medica was used to represent it. Later, minerals and animals were also used as medicines for treating diseases: but the word Materia Medica is still used along the same lines. Today's lecture on Materia Medica refers to all medicines.</p>
<p>We in China have always used plant-based medicines to treat diseases. In the West, grass and plants were also the main means of treating diseases in the past. In recent years, science has developed day by day, and the use of medicine has also been continuously improved. For example, the invention of X-rays, radium pills, and endocrine hormones all occupy an important position in medical treatment. This is a well-known fact to medical colleagues. However, their discovery of these new drugs is based on scientific theories and experiments. The research and use of Materia Medica in our country in the past was somewhat different from that in Western countries now. It was mostly based on imagination and experience; it seems that this is still the case now, which is naturally a major obstacle to progress.</p>
<p>We know that there are still many diseases now that do not have specific medicines to deal with and eliminate them. From this perspective, China's original Materia Medica with a long history really needs to be researched and has value. Explaining and confirming its usable raw materials with scientific methods can immediately be applied widely in the world without causing fear. Recently, many sharp-eyed doctors and pharmacists in Japan and the West have begun to pay special attention to our country's medicines and have developed an interest in research: but they are using scientific experimental methods to research and explore. This seems to make us medical personnel living in China feel greatly excited. We have many Chinese Materia Medica literature; we have many Materia Medica specimens in front of us: and there are many Materia Medica that are still being continuously used by Chinese medicine practitioners: so from various perspectives - textual aspects and literature specimen practice, etc., our research on Materia Medica has extremely convenient advantages over Westerners, and can achieve twice the result with half the effort. I believe that all Chinese people who are interested in researching Materia Medica should unite and work hard, and will definitely emit a ray of brilliant light in the world of medicine!</p>
<p>What I want to declare here is that the scientific research of Materia Medica that I am talking about today is naturally not perfect: if there are any shortcomings, please give special instructions.</p>
<p>Origin of Materia Medica</p>
<p>When it comes to the origin of Materia Medica, we must first discuss the term Materia Medica. In what era did it originate? This is worth investigating. Looking back at our country's history, we know that the word Materia Medica is not found in the Records of the Grand Historian; the author of the Records of the Grand Historian was Sima Qian of the Han Dynasty; from this we can know that the term Materia Medica did not exist in the early Han Dynasty. During the Warring States period, everyone knew that Bian Que was a famous doctor of that period, but in Bian Que's time, there was no term Materia Medica either. Judging from the facts: before Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty, the name Materia Medica did not exist. Later, the words Materia Medica were first recorded in the Records of the Suburban Sacrifices in the Book of Han. Now let's look at the origin of the word Materia Medica in the Book of Han and record it below:</p>
<p>Records of Suburban Sacrifices in the Book of Han (Emperor Cheng of Han, the second year of Jianshi, namely 21 BC)</p>
<p>"More than seventy alchemists, envoys, assistant officials, Materia Medica attendants were all hoofed families"</p>
<p>Art and Literature Records in the Book of Han (Liu Xin)</p>
<p>"Those who prescribe prescriptions know the cold and warm of Materia Medica, the depth of diseases, fake medicine tastes, nourishing because of the air, direct debate on the five bitter flavors, leading to the Qi of water and fire, to open and resolve knots, friendship in peace"</p>
<p>Records of Emperor Ping of Han (the fifth year of the Western Era)</p>
<p>"Solicit from all over the world those who understand lost classics, ancient records, celestial phenomena, calendar calculations, musical scales, elementary school history techniques, alchemy Materia Medica, and those who teach the Five Classics, Analects, Classics, Erya. Issue a sealed edict to the capital"</p>
<p>Biography of Lou Hu during the reign of Wang Mang (the tenth year of the Western Era)</p>
<p>"Hu was young. His father was a doctor. He went in and out of noble families in Chang'an. Hu recited medical classics, Materia Medica prescriptions, and defended one hundred thousand words"</p>
<p>Secondly, regarding the origin of Materia Medica, according to research, it can be divided into three types: (1) immortals and magic; (2) alchemy; (3) there are many medicine names in the Classic of Mountains and Seas.</p>
<p>(1) In ancient times, when it was still a theocracy, it seemed that everything in the human world was dominated by the so-called "gods" in the dark, so at that time, when huge numbers of people suffered from diseases, they sought gods and divination, relying on those unscientific prescriptions to treat and hear about diseases; that period can be said to be the most prosperous period of immortals and magic, and it was also the initial period of the history of Materia Medica, because in the confusion, some so-called therapeutic Materia Medica were sought, and from experience, medicines with actual efficacy were slowly understood.</p>
<p>Figures who had close relationships between immortals, magic, and Materia Medica. Such as Qin Shihuang; because he wanted to maintain his world from the first generation to the ten thousandth generation, he heard that there were immortal medicines of longevity on the islands of Fusang, so he wonderfully dispatched Xu Fu to carry three thousand boys and girls to those islands to seek the immortal prescriptions for longevity. As a result, Xu Fu could not obtain the immortal prescriptions, so he stayed on the three islands with those boys and girls. The three islands are now Japan, so some people say that some of the people in Japan today are descendants of the boys and girls brought out by Xu Fu. Another example is during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty: because Emperor Wu believed in magic very much, the magic of immortals was extremely prosperous at that time, but later, the magic did not work as well as the alchemists said, and Emperor Wu gradually realized that there were many untrustworthy aspects; and at about the same time, Prime Minister Kuang Heng submitted a memorial, believing that the heretical theories of the alchemists were all deceiving and confusing the public and should be banned. From then on, the magic of immortals gradually declined!</p>

<p>— Yueqi</p>
<p>—Story of Medicine Ten—</p>
<p>Under certain circumstances - we can only describe these circumstances with the word "stimulation" - a strong impulse emanates from the nerve center, showing considerable symptoms. "Epilepsy" and "Migraine" are the two most famous diseases caused by this. Epilepsy is due to the spontaneous impulses of the motor nerve center: migraine is due to the spontaneous impulses of the sensory nerve center. These two diseases are quite similar. We might as well call migraine the sensory form of epilepsy. Both are periodic symptoms, both are hereditary diseases, and both have prodromal symptoms before an attack.</p>
<p>During an epileptic seizure, due to the unrestrained motor nerve impulses, the patient's whole body contracts, and the muscles contract very strongly. Sometimes, injury to the head above the motor area, penetrating the skull and causing the cells on the brain surface to form scars: this is also a cause of epilepsy. Tumors in the motor area can also cause the same result. This is called "Jacksonian epilepsy" - named after the famous brain surgeon Hughlings Jackson - and can be treated with surgery. The treatment method is to remove the tumor. However, most cases of epilepsy are incurable; there are no organizational changes in the motor nerve cells, not even visible under a microscope, and periodic contractions invade most of the patient's life. Before an attack, there is often a prodromal symptom, which informs the patient: the old illness is about to break out again. The form of the prodromal symptom varies from time to time. Sometimes black spots appear in front of the eyes, sometimes a bell-like sound is heard, sometimes the eyelids spasm, and sometimes a strong emotional excitement is felt. Epilepsy is a historically famous disease because it is often accompanied by great genius. It is said that Napoleon and Caesar both suffered from this disease.</p>
<p>Migraine is one of the most interesting diseases. Regardless of men or women, regardless of strength or weakness, anyone can suffer from this disease; many doctors who are good at self-care also suffer from migraines. They don't know which day they will suffer from migraine; they cannot prevent it, and there is no way to prevent it. But there are prodromal symptoms: some feel unusually happy and excited the day before, and they know full well that they will suffer the next day: some sleep more soundly than usual, and when they wake up, they know that their old enemy will arrive at noon: some hear the distant bell sound so beautiful that it is extraordinary, and when the bell sound subsides, their headache will break out. The most common prodromal symptom is the appearance of colored, tortuous light lines in front of the eyes. Strangely enough, these light lines only appear in half of the visual field. It comes suddenly and goes suddenly. Something in the brain clicks, and the pain is completely gone. Sometimes, after a short nap, the old enemy has left without saying goodbye when they wake up. Migraine is also an incurable disease, and patients have to let it stop on its own; probably, the periodic migraine rarely stops after men reach middle age and women reach menopause.</p>

<p>(69) Jaundice (Part 1)</p>
<p>(Question, what is jaundice?</p>
<p>(Answer) Jaundice is a general term for diseases in which the skin and mucous membranes are dyed yellow by bile pigment: it contains the meaning of bile color. Most of them are symptoms caused by liver and gallbladder diseases.</p>
<p>(Question) Speaking from the cause, how many types of jaundice are there?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are mechanical jaundice, catarrhal jaundice, toxic jaundice, septic jaundice, and hemolytic jaundice.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the cause of mechanical jaundice?</p>
<p>(Answer) The cause of this type of jaundice lies in the narrowing or blockage of the bile duct. Because bile is easily obstructed by the bile duct and stagnates, it is absorbed into the whole body through blood vessels and lymphatic vessels, causing jaundice.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the reasons for obstructing the bile duct?</p>
<p>(Answer) The reasons for obstruction within the bile duct are gallstones, parasites, coagulated blood, or mucus; the obstruction of the bile duct wall is inflammation, swelling, or scar contraction of the bile duct; outside the bile duct are new growths and tumors.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the symptoms of mechanical jaundice?</p>
<p>(Answer) The conjunctiva of the eyeball turns yellow first, followed by the whole body skin turning yellow, and the palatal mucosa in the mouth also</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>shows obvious yellow staining. The skin is itchy, and secretions, such as urine, sweat, amniotic fluid, etc., all contain bile pigment; milk, phlegm, Wu Ye weeping, mucus, etc. sometimes also contain</p>
<p>(Question) What is the difference in the liver of patients with jaundice?</p>
<p>(Answer) The liver of patients with jaundice is enlarged and its hardness also increases; later it shrinks. Often the enlargement of the gallbladder can be felt. Sometimes splenomegaly is seen.</p>
<p>(Question) What changes occur in the stool of patients?</p>
<p>(Answer) The stool turns grayish-white, constipated, and emits a foul odor that is not easily expelled. This is due to the lack of bile pigment and fat absorption disorders.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the abnormal symptoms of the tongue coating, appetite, and body temperature of patients with mechanical jaundice?</p>
<p>(Answer) The tongue is covered with a thick coating, and appetite is poor. Body temperature is often lower than normal; the pulse rate is also reduced.</p>
<p>(Question) What other symptoms are there?</p>
<p>(Answer) Occasionally there are yellow vision, night blindness: painting blindness, etc. In addition, the body loses weight, and there is bleeding from the skin and mucous membranes (like nosebleeds, bloody stools, or vomiting blood).</p>
<p>(Question) What is the prognosis of mechanical jaundice?</p>
<p>(Answer) It depends on the condition of the original disease and is not necessarily good. If jaundice persists for more than three months, it is probably dangerous. Because it can cause the body to develop cholemia, neurological symptoms, delusions, and coma, etc.</p>
<p>(Question) How should mechanical jaundice be treated?</p>
<p>(Answer) First, it is necessary to treat the cause. Second is diet. That is, eat semi-liquid food every day, avoid fats, spices, and alcoholic beverages. Eat more starches and sugars. Protein foods must also be slightly restricted. Third, medicines; use magnesium sulfate, artificial mineral salt, calomel, etc. When the skin is itchy, use calamine lotion and alcohol, salicylic acid alcohol, etc.: or take bromine preparations and atropine, etc. internally.</p>

<p>(65) Chronic Conjunctivitis</p>
<p>There are many and varied causes of chronic conjunctivitis. They can be divided into seven categories. Namely (1) failure to fully treat acute conjunctivitis. (2) Due to living conditions. Such as frequent contact with dust and soot. Or lack of sleep at night. Or frequent exposure to wind and rain. (3) Due to occupational reasons. Such as stokers and blacksmiths who often work near flames. (4) Living in poorly ventilated, crowded places with many people, and lacking fresh air and with a lot of smoke and dust (such as theaters, hotels, barbershops, cafes, dance halls, school dormitories, public buses, trains, streetcars, factories, etc.). (5) When suffering from astigmatism and hyperopia. (6) Generally, the compatriots who have fallen into the underworld. Lying on opium couches all day long. Living in confined rooms. With lots of smoke and lack of fresh air. (7) Caused by local reasons. Such as foreign bodies, chalazion, trichiasis, eyelid eczema, eyelid inflammation, meibomian gland obstruction, ectropion, lacrimal duct stenosis, and dacryocystitis, etc. All seven of these are sufficient to cause chronic conjunctivitis. Speaking of its symptoms, they are much milder than those of acute conjunctivitis. The ordinary eyelid conjunctiva also becomes congested. The conjunctiva is generally cloudy and thickened. The papillae are enlarged. The conjunctiva is not smooth at all. It becomes rough. Although there is little secretion, the edges of the eyelids are often sticky every morning. Sometimes soap-like foam can be observed on the edges of the eyelids. Sometimes it mixes with tears to form an emulsion. The edges of the eyelids are often red. The appearance is as if crying. Near the corner of the eye. Sometimes skin peeling, cracking, chapping, etc. can occur.</p>
<p>Patients with this disease, in mild cases, may not feel any pain. However, most feel that the eyelids are heavy. It is easy to fatigue when opening the eyes. So the eyes of patients often seem tired and sleepy. In addition, burning, itching, photophobia, frequent blinking, dry eyes, and the sensation of the eyelids sticking to the eyeball, etc. are also common symptoms. These symptoms usually gradually increase from morning to night. So patients feel tired soon after working.</p>
<p>The treatment method for this disease. First, pay attention to eye hygiene. Restrict the use of the eyes. Wear colored glasses to avoid light stimulation. Or use protective glasses to prevent the invasion of smoke and dust. At the same time, improve or eliminate the causes mentioned above. Medical treatment such as (1) If there is acute conjunctivitis. Treat it immediately. Avoid it turning into this disease. (2) Living conditions must be improved. (3) This is a matter of career. (4) Improve ventilation equipment. (5) Correct refractive errors of the eyes. (6) Abstain from addictions. This can protect the eyes and increase longevity. (7) Treat the diseases that cause local reasons.</p>

<p>— Lin Jianxian</p>
<p>(Question 11) Why do most Chinese people not chew slowly when eating, but prefer to eat quickly? Should this habit be corrected?</p>
<p>(Answer) Chinese people do not understand the importance of digestion in the mouth, so they are unwilling to chew more; they leave their readily available teeth unused, burying their natural function. Some people even use soup to rinse their rice, finishing it in two or three mouthfuls, half swallowing and half drinking. Much of the food eaten in this way is excreted before the stomach and intestines have time to digest it. Eating twice as much food only yields half the nourishment, which is not worth it. Many people eat a lot at each meal, but do not gain weight, and this is the reason. Moreover, because digestion in the mouth is insufficient, the stomach and intestines have to increase their burden. Over time, this leads to indigestion and other gastrointestinal diseases, resulting in a sallow complexion and thinness, which is quite harmful. Therefore, to pay attention to hygiene, the bad habit of eating quickly must be reformed. Each meal should be chewed slowly and thoroughly. Some doctors even advocate chewing each mouthful of rice at least sixty times, until there is nothing left to chew. I hope that everyone, even if they cannot do this, will pay attention to developing the good habit of chewing thoroughly. It is definitely beneficial to health.</p>
<p>(Question 12) How should people with weak stomachs and intestines eat?</p>
<p>(Answer) (1) They should chew thoroughly. (2) They should not use soup or tea to rinse their rice, because rinsing with soup reduces the secretion of saliva and the number of times they chew. (3) There is no need to exclusively choose soft foods such as eggs and milk. Even dry, hard, and coarse foods such as peanuts and hard-shelled fruits can be easily digested and very nourishing if they are chewed thoroughly and not eaten in excessive amounts. There are indeed many people who have cured their gastrointestinal diseases or turned their bodies from weak to strong by developing these good habits.</p>

<p>(Question 12) What is the function of teeth in pronunciation?</p>
<p>(Answer) Teeth can assist the tongue, making speech fluent and pronunciation accurate. If the front teeth are missing, speech will leak air, which is very inconvenient.</p>
<p>(Question 14) What is the relationship between teeth and appearance?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are two kinds of relationships: indirect and direct. The indirect relationship is that teeth support the muscles of the lips and cheeks, making the face upright. If teeth are lost in youth, the muscles of the lips and cheeks will shrink, and the face will look like an old woman's! The direct relationship is that clean teeth can increase beauty. Who doesn't admire "bright eyes and white teeth"! If one's mouth is full of dirty and uneven teeth, people will find it disgusting and will "avoid it by a mile"! Therefore, teeth have a very close relationship with social interaction.</p>
<p>Chapter 2 Growth of Teeth</p>
<p>Section 1 Growth and Replacement of Deciduous Teeth</p>
<p>(Question 15) How many sets of teeth can a person grow in their lifetime?</p>
<p>(Answer) Two sets: the first set is deciduous teeth, and the second set is permanent teeth.</p>
<p>(Question 16) At what age do deciduous teeth grow?</p>
<p>(Answer) Deciduous teeth grow gradually between the ages of six months and three years after a child is born.</p>
<p>(Question 17) How many deciduous teeth are there in total? What is the order in which they grow?</p>
<p>(Answer) There are twenty in total. The first to emerge are the central incisors, which grow around six to seven months of age. The second are the lateral incisors, which grow around eight to ten months of age. The third are the first molars, which grow around ten to sixteen months of age. The fourth are the canines, which grow around sixteen to twenty months of age. The fifth are the second molars, which grow around twenty to thirty months of age. There is one of each of these five types of teeth on each side of the upper and lower jaws, so there are twenty in total.</p>

<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Anesthetics</p>
<p>The most important anesthetics are morphine, opium, heroin, codeine, etc., among which morphine occupies the most important position and can be used as a representative of anesthetics. A detailed description is given below:</p>
<p>Morphine</p>
<p>The chemical composition of morphine is C17H19NO3, that is, seventeen carbon molecules, nineteen hydrogen molecules, one nitrogen molecule, and two oxygen molecules. Morphine is also an important component of opium. Dry opium contains about nine percent morphine. Morphine is a fine white powder or fine white crystals, easily soluble in water, with a bitter taste and no odor.</p>
<p>The most important function of morphine in the body is to anesthetize the brain. In the laboratory, testing the effect of morphine on frogs, the result is that the actions of a frog poisoned with morphine are the same as those of a frog with its cerebrum removed. Its effect on other animals and the human body is roughly the same. Therefore, the greatest effect of morphine is to anesthetize sensation. The sensation of pain is located entirely in the cerebrum. Once the cerebrum is anesthetized, both the sensation of pain and ordinary sensations are lost. Now, for example, if a finger is cut off, the pain is very severe. The effect is that a stimulus from the injured area is transmitted to the pain sensation center in the cerebrum, and the injured person feels pain. If the cerebrum is deeply anesthetized, not only will one not know the pain of cutting off a finger, but one will not even know the pain of cutting off a hand or a foot. It must be known that whether one feels pain or not when cutting off a hand or foot, the body is injured in the same way. It is not that being numb and not feeling pain means that there is no injury. In addition to anesthetizing pain, morphine also anesthetizes other sensations, and is also a powerful hypnotic. Addicts seem to feel excitement after injecting morphine, but this is actually an anesthetic effect, which is the deceptive effect of morphine. Now, for example, a person is tormented by mental pain all day long, with anxiety and sleeplessness, and is extremely distressed. But once he becomes insane due to excessive anxiety, he changes his normal state, his anxiety disappears completely, and he shouts and laughs as if he is overjoyed, no longer knowing any pain. The excitatory effect of morphine is similar to this.</p>
<p>Morphine has an obstructive effect on the respiratory system. Small amounts of morphine cause weak breathing, while large amounts of morphine cause respiratory arrest and death. Small amounts of morphine have little effect on blood flow, while large amounts of morphine lower blood pressure and endanger life.</p>
<p>Morphine also has a very important effect on the digestive tract. The most important of these is the constipating effect. It can be said that people with morphine or opium addictions are somewhat constipated, and the greater the addiction, the worse the constipation. It is not uncommon for long-time addicts to have a bowel movement only once every one or two weeks. Morphine-like substances cause constipation by: (1) Morphine tightens the pyloric sphincter, causing food to enter the small intestine from the stomach more slowly, so the intestine is less stimulated and less peristalsis occurs. (2) Morphine-like substances numb the sensory function of the anus. The un-numbed anus has a sensory function, that is, when feces accumulate in the large intestine, it triggers a feeling of urgent defecation, and one must go to the toilet. The numbed anus loses this sensation (due to the cerebrum being anesthetized), so defecation can be arbitrarily delayed for many days. (3) Reducing the peristaltic action of the small and large intestines. This is the biggest reason. During digestion, the remaining residue must move downward through the peristalsis of the small and large intestines. Reducing peristalsis slows down the movement of feces downward, resulting in constipation. Long-time addicts have been constipated for a long time, and their bodies are full of toxins (opium toxins and waste toxins). Naturally, their natural intelligence and nature are completely lost. Where do they still talk about propriety, justice, integrity, and a sense of shame! Ask which addict has ever invented anything. Aside from harming their own families and their own compatriots, how would they know how to do things that are beneficial to society and the country. Most of the time, it is not that their nature is bad, but it is the effect of opium toxins.</p>
<p>The proper and improper uses of morphine</p>
<p>The greatest use of morphine is to temporarily relieve severe pain in a short period of time, but it must be used properly. It must be managed and used by a licensed physician. Using it casually is harmful. Examples of proper use are given below. For example, a person has a rotten leg amputated by surgery. He is indeed in great pain for two or three days after the amputation. If he is injected with a small amount of morphine every day during these days to anesthetize his brain, he will feel less pain. After a few days, when the pain is gone, the morphine can be stopped. This is just an anesthetic effect, and the injury to the body is still the same. Using it for short-term severe pain can be considered a savior of mankind. For example, a person suffering from a cancerous tumor in the late stage is in pain all day long, and the doctor has proven that there is no hope of life. Using anesthesia on him to reduce his suffering during his lifetime is also permissible by humanity. For example, there was a patient who had a cancerous tumor under the throat, and in the late stage, it obstructed breathing, and this person suffocated to death after a few days. Anesthetizing his nerves so that he dies naturally without realizing it is much better than suffocating him to death alive without anesthesia. These are all proper uses of anesthetics.</p>
<p>Morphine should not be used for all long-term pains, such as bone pain, stomach pain, and heart pain. Morphine numbs the brain for only a few hours, and after the numbness passes, one will feel pain again. Note that using morphine and opium to treat these diseases is deceiving oneself. Morphine cannot cure a disease other than its anesthetic effect. If it is used whenever there is pain, although one feels no pain for a short period of time, because the disease is still in the body, one will be tightly bound by anesthetics in an unconscious way, and it will be impossible to stop using them. Opium has the same effect as morphine. All kinds of chronic pain have other harmless treatments, and patients must not fall for anesthetics.</p>
<h3 id="e193">A Brief Discussion of Pulmonary Tuberculosis (68) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>Chapter 12 Treatment of Pulmonary Tuberculosis</p>
<p>Section 1 Natural Therapy</p>
<p>This is a very important treatment method! Every patient should strictly adhere to it. Among them, the most important and worthy of special mention is "fresh air"! We know that people's need for air is more important than anything else. Food is used to sustain life, but if one does not eat for a day or two, it will not endanger life. Air is very different, and one cannot live without it for a moment. For patients with this disease, it promotes metabolism, regulates body temperature, and increases the body's physiological defense mechanisms. Indirectly, the general symptoms of this disease can also be alleviated or eliminated as a result. Therefore, it is sometimes more important for patients with pulmonary tuberculosis to breathe fresh air than to see a doctor and take medicine. As for symptomatic drug therapy, that goes without saying! In fact, there are many clinical examples of cures achieved solely by this air therapy, and this is the majority. This kind of unpretentious achievement is especially obvious in patients with early-stage disease, and almost all other treatment methods can be completely abandoned. This treatment method, which seems unremarkable, is actually very beneficial. I hope that people suffering from this disease will keep it in mind.</p>
<p>The implementation of air therapy is almost no easier than in large cities with dense populations: patients only need to stay in fresh air, in places with less wind and more sunlight. The ability of cold to worsen symptoms is definitely not as great as most people expect, and patients do not need to worry too much. In addition, air and climate are not unrelated. In the north, the climate is cold, dry, sunny, with little sunlight, and lots of frost and fog: patients cough more severely, easily catch colds, and have increased body temperature. In the south, the climate is hot, the sunlight is too strong, and the regulation of cold and heat is uneven: patients are more likely to develop heart failure, loss of appetite, and other phenomena. Whether the climate is good or not is an important condition for treating patients with this disease. Therefore, changing places for recuperation sometimes has great success for patients with this disease.</p>

<h3 id="e194">Idle Talk on "Drama Performances for Disaster Relief" <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Lügang</p>
<p>In order to provide relief to the general population of affected disaster victims, the people in Shanghai have initiated a charity relief association, urging everyone to search their pockets for this "righteous act" of rescuing our compatriots. Naturally, everyone is happy to assist in this effort, as the saying goes, "People are not plants, how can they be without feelings?" It is just a pity that due to the economic panic of the past few years, many people have gone bankrupt one after another. As for the poor? Their hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient, and they are afraid that their own Western meals will not be full, let alone benefit others? As for those who are well-fed and well-clothed, they seem to be separated by heaven and hell, and there are quite a few who turn a deaf ear. Naturally, there are also those who are willing to generously donate, plucking a hair to help the masses. However, with such a major disaster, it cannot be alleviated by small amounts of money. As the saying goes, "A cup of water for a cartload of burning firewood," what is the use of that?</p>
<p>Therefore, some people, in addition to generously donating, have also advocated things like "flower selections for disaster relief" and "drama performances for disaster relief," which is naturally easier and more widespread than persuading people to donate. Moreover, at the same time, one is "enjoying oneself and also providing disaster relief," so why shouldn't everyone be happy to do so?</p>
<p>However, since we are not "flower-picking bees," "flower selections" are simply irrelevant to us, and that is naturally a game for the tycoons to play. However, drama performances are different. Even if it is not for disaster relief, we always have to watch plays at ordinary times, and watching plays is not necessarily just for enjoyment. We do not deny that drama has the meaning of educating the public, so drama at least has some influence on our lives. Now that we are going to have "drama performances for disaster relief," it is also more "justified" and "grand" than "flower selections" and the like. However, it is only in name that it is "drama performances for disaster relief," but the content of the play has no "disaster" situation at all. That would be putting too much emphasis on "relief" and neglecting "disaster," because: after watching it, the audience still has no feeling, because they are no different from watching ordinary plays.</p>
<p>I believe that if "drama performances for disaster relief" can truly reflect the disaster situation in the play, then everyone will get a little benefit. Otherwise, the disaster victims receiving relief will inevitably be too wronged, because after all, no one can truly know what kind of painful life they are living! In previous years, there was a film "Raging Torrent" about the floods, and there was also a script "Flood" in the theater, but this year there is nothing. Looking around, one cannot help but feel sad!</p>
<h3 id="e195">A Solitary Song <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Lion</p>
<p>I loathe people. Or is it that I am loathed by them? For many days, I have enjoyed being close to solitude, like a wild goose, flying and calling at the same time. Below is a stream of cold water, so merciless, unable to bear the sorrowful chirping, the sorrowful song. But occasionally a feather falls from an old wound, and it will be pushed and rolled by the waves into the deep, unfathomable whirlpool. Where is the sandy beach? On which sandy beach is there no great net of the goose-catcher spread? Tired, tired, but where is the place of rest?</p>
<p>Alright, I will rest on this steep cliff for a while. I no longer seek the sandy beach. Every day I have a silver night, millions of floating stars, a few wisps of wandering, tired, pale yellow clouds that have also stopped flowing. The soft dew moistens the mountain fruits that are maturing. Nature's embrace tolerates my solitude. Nature is not lonely. Nature is not empty. Let me be alone, let me be alone. I have abandoned fame and wealth. I have abandoned the partners who float and sink in the world of sound and color. I hold the bright moon and laugh heartily. Even the owl does not cry at night.</p>
<p>Solitude is not bad. Solitude is not bad. This world, these trees, these green grasses, these ripe red fruits... all seem to be mine. No one competes with me. No one looks askance at me with hateful eyes. No one breathes roughly. Feeling so relaxed, I seem to have transcended my usual self and reached another world. Although this world also does not have a flat, wide road, only I walk leisurely. In this lonely night, I can think about anything, I can think about nothing. The hypocritical things that must be done in the crowd, the hypocritical words that must be said, the hypocritical faces that must be worn, I can now ignore them all. No fetters, no dazzling, no temptations, no hidden arrows, no fraud... none of them exist. My whole body is filled with the joyful feeling of freedom. The freedom that is not easily enjoyed in the crowd, I have obtained in solitude. I enjoy it to the fullest, enjoying the boundless natural blessing. Nature is definitely not as stingy and ungrateful as the crowd.</p>
<p>Don't ask me, no one ask me. My mind has long been exhausted. Let me rest for a while. Let me warm a spring-like gentle dream in the purple solitude. Oh, friend, please don't bother me again. Please don't touch me again with your cold face and burning hands. I can't stand this kind of cold and hot stimulation! Let me see a few fewer tragedies in the grindstone of life, see a few fewer trembling figures of orphans and widows, a spasm-stricken person in the mud, a madman whistling in the hospital bed. Let my heartbeat pause for a while. Let the blood circulation in the heart chamber temporarily achieve harmony. Don't laugh at me, no one laugh at me. I am not afraid of reality and trying to escape. No one can escape reality. But I am tired, tired. I need to rest a bit.</p>
<p>This boundless vastness, this boundless night, I hold my breath, and from silence, I comprehend</p>
<h2>Page 18</h2>
<p>The eternal law of the universe, the long-hidden dream of life. Everything on the cliff is silent. Only the flocks of birds that have not yet fallen asleep on the treetops are absorbing the fresh nourishment of the natural world. How gentle, how good it is. I am willing to be a blade of grass swaying in the cold stream, a cloud drifting in the sky, or grow wings and fly into a flock of little birds. I do not want the greatness and transcendence of the crowd. Every night, every night, I bathe in the cold moonlight and sing...</p>
<h3 id="e196">Autumn Insects Night Talk <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>— Xiusi</p>
<p>Sitting alone late at night, the sounds of autumn fill the building. At first, I find them annoying, but after a while, they bring me joy.</p>
<p>The neighbor's child was careless somehow, and his cricket ran into my room, calling loudly. I put down my work and searched everywhere, and found it by the window. Originally, I wanted to find the cricket, but when I saw it, I didn't want to catch it, nor did I want to drive it away. I listened quietly to it chirping in the wind, as if I was listening to a great musician singing at the top of his lungs. Unexpectedly, it was not the cricket I was looking for. Another chirping sound rang out in the room, as if two great musicians were singing in harmony. Listening to their singing, one sang in a high register, and the other sang in a low-mid register. They were harmonious, and I was completely intoxicated in their singing, forgetting myself completely.</p>
<p>Some people consider frogs to be the poets of spring. I think crickets are the musicians of autumn. I don't like the poets of spring. Isn't that so? They croak so noisily and monotonously in the ponds. Even when reciting poetry, one should pay attention to rhythm and cadence in order to be considered reciting poetry. Always reciting croak, croak, croak, isn't that boring poetry? I am not a poet and I am not happy to listen to it. Do you think that true poets would willingly acknowledge that frogs are poets?</p>
<p>Frogs are not as good as crickets by ten thousand times. Besides croaking and making noise, they have no other skills. As for crickets? They can sing and they can fight. They are quite like the heroes of the Romantic era, like knights. Wasn't Byron a poet who could fight? However, although crickets are famous for fighting throughout ancient and modern times, it has not been recorded in books whether they fight for the country or the people. I think that crickets' ability to fight is the instinct of living beings to survive. In their place of growth, there may also be distinctions between families, nations, and tribes, and therefore there are also occasional group wars to defend themselves against the oppression of the strong, such as wars for the country and the people. Unlike those who are kept in earthen pots and only act as individualistic, inexplicable heroes.</p>
<p>Crickets can sing and fight. I love crickets.</p>
<p>Talking about crickets reminds me of ants. Aren't ants even more lovable than crickets? Although they are not poets and cannot sing, they are able to endure hardship, explore, and fight, and they fight as a group. They are truly a good model for people. Now it is autumn, and the ants are at their busiest time, storing food for the harsh winter. Summer insects, such as cicadas, although they were proud and happy to sing when their time came, cannot withstand the oppression of the cold wind when summer goes and autumn comes, and they have long sealed their mouths. Crickets, which are able to fight in the autumn wind and sing at the top of their lungs, seem to be more worthy of pride than summer cicadas. However, when autumn goes and winter comes, won't crickets also disappear without a trace? Only ants, their time from spring to summer is a time for enjoyment, and their time from autumn to winter is a time for busyness and hibernation. They are happy and healthy all year round. They are not proud, nor are they sad. They enjoy themselves for life, they fight for life, and they live for life. Isn't that their "view of life"? However, I don't know how long the lifespan of ants is. I love them, and when I think of that, I would like to ask an entomologist.</p>
<p>Autumn ants are busy storing food for the winter, so they often go out to explore. Although they are not autumn insects, they often appear in people's eyes in autumn. In the morning, I saw an ant prowling on my bag of white sugar. I thought that if it went back and reported, it would come with the whole country, and a bag of white sugar would be finished. Just like killing an enemy scout on the battlefield, it is better to kill it than to detain it, so I used my finger to bury it alive in the sugar. Now, when I think of its "personality," it is as if I have done something wrong.</p>
<h3 id="e197">Nighttime Musings <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Mo Jia</p>
<p>Watching the green leaves outside the window wither faster and faster, every time I go out, they are scattered all over the ground, adding to the chores of the old gatekeeper. I realize that the autumn atmosphere is gradually thickening and cannot be dispelled. The falling of flowers and leaves seems to be arranged by nature, an irreversible fate. I really lack the elegant mood to lament their misfortune, and I certainly won't have any endless sighs or idle sorrows because of it. Because in my own busy days, I simply can't spare any time to sigh over the passing of spring and mourn the coming of autumn. But recently, I don't know why, I seem to have a kind of rootless emptiness haunting me, always close to me. This emptiness is rapidly swelling, and it has become something weighty on my shoulders, slowly making me feel heavy. So, I often have strange dreams, dreaming that I am a piece of duckweed floating in the vast sea; dreaming that I am a kite stuck in mid-air by the wind, with its string broken and helpless; and dreaming that I am lost and wandering in the dark, dark countryside, hearing faint, fearful howls behind me. With a start, I often wake up like this. When there is moonlight, its faint glow shines on the head of my bed, and I touch my forehead, which is still oozing cold sweat. Recalling the experiences in my dream, I can barely count them, but after careful examination, they are already blurred.</p>
<p>For several nights in a row, it has been like this, and after waking up, it is not easy to fall asleep again. Lying down, listening to the sporadic cries of the night food vendors in the street, or the tail sound of a car speeding past like a gust of wind, I suddenly have two completely different feelings: I can review the cries of the vendors every day, and I am very familiar with those sighing voices. But every time I hear them, I always think of a hard-working person carrying the burden of life, accompanying his own lonely shadow, walking through the desolate streets, desolate alleys, and desolate alleys, sending the long night deeper and deeper. He is carrying a heavy burden and heavy sorrows that no one cares about! Perhaps while my meditation is still unfinished, a loud car horn rushes past again. I know that the car rushing past is carrying the lewd pleasures and joys of some night revelers. When the sound fades away, the faint cries of the vendor float up clearly again. In the lonely night heart, the two sounds blend together. Soon they sink down, and soon they spread up again.</p>
<p>After my dream, my heart is already extraordinarily empty, and now I feel even more fragile, as if tears are about to squeeze out of my eyes. I have no idea why, but when I hear a relatively sharp cry, my heart can't help but tighten, and then beat non-stop. Especially in the silent night, when attacked by the distant dream emotions, and hearing the desolate cries outside, tears really stream down in strings.</p>
<h3 id="e198">Balsam <a href="#e198" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c198" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">198</a></h3>
<p>— Hua Zhi</p>
<p>Seeing the scarlet nail polish on the fingernails of urban women, I think of the balsam flowers in my hometown. My late father liked to grow bamboo and raise fish. Those goldfish that he searched for everywhere, carefully collecting and breeding, all died within two months after his death. After a heavy snowy winter, because we were in mourning, no one paid attention to his beloved fish. The fish tank was frozen to the bottom, and the goldfish, like frozen glutinous rice cakes, floated belly up, congealed in the crystal ice, dying for him. There were about a hundred goldfish, divided into categories and stored in three large tanks. When my father was alive, he spent most of his time on them every day. One of them was particularly large, with a left eye like a transparent pearl. It was a variation of the Celestial Eye goldfish, and he said that he was the only one in the whole city who had one. He often invited many friends to his home to see his fish species as an honor. But after he passed away, more than a hundred goldfish, including the only one-eyed dragon in the city, all died. This may have been unexpected by my father. However, the fact that the flower garden is now overgrown with weeds, reaching up to one's shins, is even more unexpected. The flower garden was right in front of my father's bedroom, planted with flowers and plants that bloomed in all seasons. He had different views on flowers and plants. He said that raising goldfish should be valued for their rarity, while flowers should be valued for their abundance, even if it was just grass, as long as it could produce beautiful flowers, my father would cultivate it. Therefore, there were many kinds of flowers in the flower garden for which he made up a name and labeled them with bamboo sticks, treating them the same as noble peonies and gladioli. Friends who came to see his goldfish would naturally also walk around in the flower garden. Seeing him planting flowers in such a "anything goes" manner, they objected, but they could not change my father's prejudice. I remember friends joking with my father, saying that his attitude towards raising fish was like a chaste virgin, but in the flower garden, he was acting like a prostitute. This analogy was very accurate. My father's reply was that a prostitute has a charm different from a virgin, which other flower growers cannot appreciate; this was my father's unique point of view.</p>
<p>The area of the flower garden was very small. Except for a stone-paved walkway in the middle, potted flowers were neatly placed on both sides, and the rest was sown as he pleased. Because my father's view on planting flowers was like this, as long as the flower garden didn't have it, he was very grateful for his friends' gifts. So, the small flower garden was like a flower exhibition, with all kinds of flowers available. But at that time, there were no balsam flowers planted. Until a friend jokingly sent a packet of balsam seeds, my father, without asking why, poured them all into the flower garden, and balsam flowers bloomed. What was strange was that the balsam also mutated, and several plants bloomed with flowers like violets, which he treasured, saying that they were a unique famous flower in our flower garden; he beautifully named them "Violet Balsam," meaning a combination of balsam and violet. But this flower's ability to reproduce was particularly great. Each flower could produce countless fruits the size of olives, and each fruit contained countless seeds. Moreover, without human intervention, when the olive</p>
<h2>Page 19</h2>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>-shaped fruit burst open, the following year there would be countless balsam flowers. By the third year, the balsam was almost about to invade the entire flower garden. My father could not appreciate that kind of unique "charm" anymore. When they just started to bloom, he almost pulled out seven out of ten. My sisters and I all pounded their flower juice to dye our nails. After that, every year we had to be careful to prune them before they fruited, otherwise next year there would be a garden full of balsam flowers.</p>
<p>After my father passed away, there was no one to manage this flower garden, but the balsam suddenly decreased, and in the second year, it disappeared completely. My mother said that the things my father loved during his lifetime were all sacrificed, and she couldn't help but feel emotional.</p>
<p>Now the flower garden is overgrown with weeds, reaching up to one's shins, and no one cares about it. Thinking about the prosperous situation of pounding balsam flower juice to dye fingernails, how can I not shed tears?</p>

<p>Drought Song</p>
<p>The sun hangs high in the sky, the clouds hide without a trace. The farmers are busy scooping water all day long, and the sun burns their shoulders and backs. Sweat drips, breath pants, the waterwheel goes up and down, the feet are swollen, the crops gradually wither, the water is exhausted, stretching their necks and hoping for rainbows. The fields are difficult to cultivate and the rent is heavy, the farmers suffer endlessly. In the year of drought, there is no harvest, and it is difficult to survive the winter without paying the rent.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Duke Huan of Qi"</p>
<p>Duke Huan of Qi had a superior spirit, and helped the Zhou Dynasty to unite the world. He forgot grievances for the people and the country. Look at how Guan Zhong once shot at his belt hook. At that time, the brothers were serving the country together, fighting each other without restraint, each fighting for their own master and plotting for their own benefit. Zhao Hu died, Guan Zhong was imprisoned, and the caged car was escorted away without stopping. Fortunately, Bao Shu was a true confidant, persuading Duke Huan not to hold grudges, and leading him into the court as prime minister, and the official military administration was immediately repaired. The Jingman people did not submit to the Zhou system, and blamed the state of Chu for being ashamed of tribute grass. He rescued the state of Wei when it was destroyed, and had nine alliances with the princes in his life. He loved talent and wore his clothes and hats hastily at night, and then took in the poor Ning Qi. It is a pity that he did not listen to the advice of loyal ministers, and three treacherous ministers were in the same class. Prince Kaifang forgot his own country, and Yi Ya killed his son for what he sought. Shushao Yue cut his body and was inhumane. Later, they really rebelled together, and Duke Huan's illness did not subside. He lay in his coffin for sixty-seven days, and his throat was cut off from food and drink during his lifetime. It was too late to regret it, and he was worried even in death.</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Lotus Young Master's Self-Lament"</p>
<p>Monthly roses have just met the long summer days, and the lotus young master is wandering on the embankment. A pair of lotus flowers bloom for a good night's banquet, and willow catkins fly everywhere in madness. Evening primroses show deep affection, and the Dark Wave Magpie Bridge leads the Cowherd. The poppy is inherently frivolous, failing to live up to the Lingxiao cloud rain scene. Hibiscus loves the thinness of yellow chrysanthemums, and the Yellow Millet Dream has not yet awakened at noon. The opium is originally more poisonous than poison, and the weak qualities of Xunlan cannot bear it. Twenty crouching under the pomegranate skirt, the red apricots out of the wall are too absurd. In the unlucky leap year, the boxwood is in a hurry, and the dodder is most heartbroken to be unable to entrust itself. Worldly feelings are even thinner than mallows, and people's faces and peach blossoms sigh at Wang Yang. Slowly arrange the cockscomb and sigh for food, the young man's self-lament is full of meaning. Who is working hard for the fruitless Buddha's hand, and the fate of empty glory is not long-lasting. The wooden pen has no flowers to invest in, and the gourd breaks and the wish is difficult to fulfill. The bloody cuckoo bird emptily complains, and the pear blossoms in the wind and rain are jealous of the delicate girl. The plum contains sourness to awaken, and it is regrettable that the evening fragrance has passed. From now on, the sunflowers must be sincere, and they smell the fragrance and dance to welcome the spring light. The crane son and plum wife will always celebrate the occasion.</p>

<h3 id="e203">"Three Daughters-in-Law" Released <a href="#e203" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c203" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">203</a></h3>
<p>The Kuailelin Company's new film "Three Daughters-in-Law" was released yesterday at the Central Grand Theater in this city. The film depicts the experiences and endings of three different types of daughters-in-law. It has a very accurate satire and praise for women who are wandering in the modern new trend. The film is directed by Wang Tian, starring Xu Suzhen, Chen Yan, Bai Ye, He Zhigang, and Qin Tong. All the music, singing, and dubbing are rare in the small company's position.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>The rules of the film industry's charity entertainment event: female stars dance for ten yuan a dance, and dancers dance for one yuan a dance.</p>
<p>Where do the ticket prices for the "film and dance exchange" figures such as Qiao Chen Jingfang, the Liang sisters, and Tan Xuerong come from? (I heard that the film industry's charity entertainment event held a discussion with female stars at the Da Hu last night to discuss dance accompaniment methods. For more details, please see tomorrow's newspaper.)</p>
<p>Camera says: "Wang Junda said that he wanted to "add eye consciousness" in the play, while Chen Dabe's "Xi Shi" said in the advertisement that there was "beautiful salt" consciousness. I would like to say to Mr. Wang that if you want "consciousness one," you can purchase it from Mr. Chen, because Mr. Chen has a lot of "beautiful salt consciousness" in stock (?)"</p>
<p>Not for grabbing business, if Mr. Wang needs other "consciousness" besides purchasing "beautiful salt consciousness," then the author dares to "recommend" to Mr. Wang with "one hundred percent" "serious, frank, and objective":</p>
<p>In the art world, there is "serious consciousness" and "great consciousness" for sale. This kind of "consciousness one paired with a tragic star type one of Wang Meiyu is really more suitable.</p>
<p>Soon, a kind of consciousness will be like medicine, "beautiful salt consciousness" six qian, "serious consciousness" three fen, "great consciousness" five li. In this way, Mr. Chen Dabe became a screenwriter."</p>
<p>However, I don't know if the Chinese film industry, which is taking medicine, will hire a doctor until the impermanence at that time?</p>
<h3 id="e205">From the Importance of Sound Effects to the Sound Effects of "The Tempest" <a href="#e205" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c205" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">205</a></h3>
<p>— Qing Yun</p>
<p>Sound effects are an essential element in sound films to promote the development of the plot. To achieve perfection in atmosphere and tone in a sound film, attention must be paid to sound effects, which cannot be ignored. On the contrary, when the plot develops to the climax of tension, if this suitable "sound effect for the development of the plot to the climax of tension" is not used, it will not only lose its due effect, but also destroy the original tension of the plot. Similarly, if the original plot lacks tension, adding suitable and perfect sound effects will inevitably easily capture the emotions of the audience.</p>
<p>Sound films produced in Europe and the United States understand the importance of the connection between sound effects and sound films, so they pay very attention to the sound effects of other sound films. But looking back at our Chinese sound films? Most of them only pay attention to the songs in the sound film, and many of the songs in the sound film have nothing to do with the plot at all, and are forcibly inserted into it. The so-called "attention" is only to cater to the trend of every film having a song. As for sound effects, they are ignored.</p>
<p>It is very gratifying that in today's sound film industry where every film must have a song and ignores sound effects, the Huayi-produced sound film "The Tempest" directed by Yuan Congmei, which is about to be released, is a unique exception that pays attention to the effect of sound effects. It does not focus on songs, but uses perfect sound effects to supplement the progress of the plot. The result of the trial performance, although it has not reached the point of perfection, is still worth exaggerating to say that the sound effect processing of "The Tempest" is quite successful; as for "The Tempest" having no song, it is not because of paying attention to sound effects and ignoring the song, but entirely because the plot does not need it.</p>
<h3 id="e206">Start of the Huai River Project <a href="#e206" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c206" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">206</a></h3>
<p>"Water Kingdom Spring and Autumn" Sets Off</p>
<p>The millions of workers in this Huai River project are farmers from nearby counties. Therefore, during the two periods of spring planting and autumn harvesting, they have to temporarily put down their work to busy themselves with their farm work. But once the farm work is completed, everyone will enthusiastically come out and work as usual. Now that the autumn harvest is over, the project office has scheduled the start of construction on the 10th of next month (October). The China Film Company's "Water Kingdom Spring and Autumn" location shooting team will also be led by the film's director, Mr. Wan Wancang, at that time, with a large number of personnel going there. It is expected that the harvest will definitely return with a triumphant song.</p>

<p>Zhang Shichuan and Zhang Jinde have returned to Shanghai yesterday. According to Dong Keyi, in addition to the dozens of beautiful shots in "Peach Blossoms After the Robbery" in Qingdao this time, there are also several hundred feet of scenery films that have been shot.</p>
<p>On Qiqi Road in the French Concession, there is a Qiqi Tennis Club, organized by several actors, directors, sound engineers, and photographers in the film industry, such as Tang Jie, the "Mr. Wang" of the New Era, Zuo Ming, and Liu Jiqun of Lianhua, all of whom are members. Every morning, they always practice. The day before yesterday, they actually went out to fight the Rong team, and as a result, they returned to the dynasty.</p>
<p>A play directed by Yu Zhongying, director of the Nanjing Central Photography Studio, is named "Rebirth." Most of the actors are actors from various companies in Shanghai. It is said that Jia Nong, Wang Guilin, and Li Junpan are all in it.</p>
<p>In Hu Die's starring "Night Fragrance," Shu Xiuwen, Sun Min, and Zhao Dan all have important positions. According to reliable news, "Night Fragrance" is scheduled to be released at the New Light Grand Theater within three days.</p>
<p>The Wan brothers, Lai Ming, Gu Chan, and Chao Chen, who are the only cartoon book writers in China with a long-standing reputation, have recently, in addition to the cartoon drawings in various Mingxing films, also had a sound cartoon in Diantong's "Urban Scenery." They are now also making a comical cartoon for Xinshengdai's "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside," the content of which is Mr. Wang fighting the mosquito soldiers, which is extremely comical.</p>
