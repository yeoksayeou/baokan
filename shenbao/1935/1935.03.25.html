<p>— 都</p>
<p>黃河工情。頃又突吿危迫。濮陽金堤。大半毀壞。貫台堵口。合龍無期。而河水連日增漲。溜勢漸悍。遙念魯豫一帶之災民。舊痛未復。新憂又集。局脊泥塗。膽戰心驚。惻愴之情。寗待深論。方今時纔春初。已呈洶湧之勢。轉瞬大汜一屆。。潰隄改道。侵衛奪淮豈。僅冀北失所保障。將令蘇皖並蒙其害故防河一事實。為目前最嚴重最切迫之問題。全國人士。當如手足之扞頭目齊。心戮力。劍及屨及以赴者也。</p>
<p>治水工作。由來視為難圖。唯能督護得力。稍收治標之效。有淸一代。黃河決口凡三十九次。自光緒十三年鄭州漫溢之後。數十年來較稱安瀾。方期河漕穩定束。水就範。何意前年一決。復釀巨患。維時被災區域貫。及五省達。五十縣。災區面積。廣至一萬五千餘方里。災民有四百萬。時間歷八閱月。不可謂非滔天之大浸矣。嗣後氾濫時期雖過。而堵口工程。迄未進展。災民呼籲。報不絕紀。卒復有去秋長垣之決口滑封。之遭殃自。是以來黃。災恐怖深中。人心而工情險惡。時感棘手。値茲凌汛之初。遂成嚴重之局。雖屬天災之流行。抑亦人謀之不臧歟。</p>
<p>吾人亦嘗焦心衡慮。以求癥結之所在。謂當局恝然於治河之工程科。則政府固嘗設各級水利機關以管理之。皇皇組織。屬於中央者。有黃河水利委員會有。華北水利委員會。屬於地方者。有冀魯豫各省黃河河務局。迨前歲水害突發。復特設黃災救濟委員會以督促之。而綜其成於全國經濟委員會。其措施不可謂不細密也。謂當局於治河之無辦法乎。則行政院固曾討論防堵於。先六省防汛會議復决定步驟於後。而魯省河務局所擬之修濬黃河尾閭計劃及。黃河水利委員會委員長李儀祉所提之治黃綱要　並皆洞中肯棨。有條不紊。是政府固未嘗無辦法也。然而卒無補於水勢之橫溢。重見此緊張之局面者。其故安在。吾人不敏。敢以一言蔽之曰。機關雖多而確切負責無人辦。法雖有。而在下奉行不力。唯其負責無人。故責難紛紜。適滋諉過之藉口唯。其奉行不力故。文書旁午祗。見空言之徒託。去年魯西災民籲請堵口之電文中。曾云。「親赴該口查看見。乾口雖合。而水口尙未動。縱有設備。而工作毫不緊張」。李儀祉於視察河工後亦云。「三省河。工未用新法。善後工程尤嫌草率」。而監委周利生於奉派調查長垣決口情形後之報吿。更直謂「舊築堤防。毫不堅實。事後成災。搶護不力」。是皆事實之所詔示。要有難以諱飾者矣。</p>
<p>時至今日。險象當前吾。人誠不必復尋過去之罅隙。作無謂之抵。蹈惟有羣策羣力共。弭巨難觀。於經會某要員之意見。似亦已見權責不一之非是。而津電傳來且。謂新工程處組成由。孔祥榕與李儀祉分負堵口培隄之責。會見指揮統一宿。弊矯除改。　更張耳目一新。懸覆轍以詔來軫。是所望於袞袞諸公之努力自靖矣。</p>

<p>物價飛漲失業增加　法國邊境戒備森嚴</p>
<p>一月十三日薩爾人民、總投票結果、百分之九十（五十二萬八千七百零四人）是贊成歸復祖國德意志的、到如今已經一個多月了、再過兩星期、薩爾就要改換一種新環境、在未實行投票之前、一般人都很興奮、很歡喜、以為不久就有光明到來、在愛國熱情和宣傳高調的雰圍中、恨不得立刻回到祖國德意志去、</p>
<p>等待了十五年的總投票運動是過去了、一般住民、工人·小商人·農夫·等、極度興奮之後、希特勒政府算得到空前的大勝利、事實上—「德意志主義」—祇是國社黨所穿的一件外套、除開這件外套、其餘的有多少是德意志的眞精神呢、不過到處都表現出卐字徽章、是新的景象、薩爾地方」切的社會制度、都經國社黨之手而改變了、以前的政治機關、商業機關、一齊停辦、或另行改組、例如天主敎靑年團。體育聯盟、社會黨俱樂部等、都被稱為「非法團體」、加以禁止、這恰和投票當時少數派所指摘的歸復祖國、是一種夢幻、至少有許多人覺着生活不方便、不如他們原來的希望、</p>
<p>三月一日以後、國聯施政委員會撤去了、跟着要撤退的是國際軍隊、人民投票委員會的衛兵、薩爾卽將和平的引渡與德國、德法問或者因此减少若千激劇的衝突、然而在另一方面、法蘭西的機動部隊、稅關、在法國與薩爾之問、以前沒有設防的、三月一日以前就都準備齊全、要建立很牢固的防衛、凡是薩爾與法國接壤的地方、立卽變作嚴峻的法德國境、表面似乎還保持着平靜的態度、但是蘭西等要塞區、—從瑞士邊境起延長到盧森保一帶、都建築起非常堅固的鋼鐵防禦陣地、或混凝土的防禦工事、那些地方都分佈着、法蘭西的衛兵、荷鎗實彈、眼睜睜的望着對方的舉動、幷且不時檢閱、演習、彷彿就有敵人來臨的形勢、法蘭西雖不必川兵到萊茵河左岸、但至少是對德國有點神經過敏、傾其全力以防備德國、自國聯决定薩爾歸還德國以後、薩爾地方在經濟上發生了巨大的變動、由食糧品屯積運動開始、肉類的市價也跟着飛漲、其餘的日用品、如毛棉織品、如罐頭、如煤油等、都現高價、這些東西在不久的將來、會貴得和德意志邊境一樣、平均起來、要漲起百分之四十以至五十、因為蔬爾以前是不抽那樣重稅的、交還給德國以後、卽須繳納與德國同樣的稅率了、例如「羅基」「吉士」牌一類的美國香姻、在薩爾祇要三法郞就可買到、在法國境內須六·六法郞、在德國如換算成法郞的話、就須三十法郞纔能到手、歸德而後、一般生活當然要增高了、</p>
<p>薩爾地方在一九二九年之前、也有過失業問題、當時每月平均僅只三千八百七十餘人、現在不同了、今年一月初、領取失業保險金的有三萬三千五百九十四人、從前薩爾的炭坑工人、可以移轉到法國去、現在法國失業人數也超過四十萬、而薩爾又變成德國的領土、法國更要限制薩爾區工人越境、則薩爾的失業工人當然要日趨困境了、</p>
<p>薩爾是出產煤炭的地方、年產煤計一千二百萬噸、以前銷售給法國的約占百分之四十、薩爾自身消費百分之四十、此外百分之二十、德國約銷百分之八、其餘則輸出於其他各國、今後五年間、法國每年要薩爾煤炭二百二十萬噸、如果不增加其購買額、薩爾的惟一產業、將感受經營上的困難了、（二月十九日於巴黎）</p>

<h3 id="c94">對於王泊先生先生「劇院設施意見書」中　所持對話劇論調的意見 <a href="#c94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— 張道藩</p>
<p>王泊生先生最近寫了一個「劇院設施意見書」在本月初句中陸續在中央日報發表了。這意見書中固然有許多値得欽佩的意見，但不幸的他對話劇的論調不免太輕率了些！所以引起了努力話劇的人們大大的反感！</p>
<p>在過去十數日內，我曾經接得北平，上海五六個朋友的信，（速唐槐秋，羅慕華兩先生在內）又曾遇見南京努力話劇的許多人，他們都對王先生把話劇一筆抹殺認爲此路不通的見解表示憤慨。都說要作文反駁。昨天見到華北日報的副刊，知道羅慕華先生已爲此事公開向讀者徵求意見了。孫德中先生也在中央日報發表「論話劇與京劇」的文章了。鬧得不好，又要引起一塲筆戰。</p>
<p>其寔這件事値不得努力話劇的人們怎樣大張旗鼓的反對。王泊生先生對話劇那種論調，固然不免過分一點。但是以現在只知努力新歌劇的王先生而作此論調。原來毫不足怪！這也正和有些努力話劇的朋友們把舊戲輕視得一錢不値一樣的不足怪！</p>
<p>「話劇是藝術」，我想是不應該成問題的。若這件事在道個時代的中國，還會成問題。豈不要笑死東洋人！話劇藝術的價値，豈能因王先生有「……牠的藝術成分又在那裏呢」？一個疑問，就抹殺了嗎？有些人的意見常常是容募改變的。當王光生當年努力話劇的時候，他又何嘗沒有把話劇當做藝術。到了他感覺此路不通而努力於舊戲，以及後來又發現舊劇有改良的必要而努力於新歌劇的此刻，他不特對話劇是藝術發生懷疑。恐怕對非新歌劇的舊戲，都懷疑了也說不定。這到底是王先生對話劇的信仰不堅，研究不深呢？抑或眞是話劇藝術根本發生了動搖呢？正値得我們仔細的研究。注意話劇的人們，那裏會因爲王先生那樣一句不能　定的話，就對話劇是藝術發生懷疑呢？</p>
<p>在努力於新歌劇的王先生看來。當然是要「新歌劇有了基礎」，話劇的演出才有一種新動向。電影藝術才可以得到一種新發展。但是在專努力於話劇的人看來，或者正和王先生相反。因爲我們拿以往話劇和電影發達的階段看來，並沒有那一國的話劇和電影是因為有了歌劇作基礎才有新動向發展的。即令王先生的話說得不錯。新歌劇的基礎何時造成，正未可定。假如二十年內造不成。努力話劇的人們，豈能「守株待免」的等到二十年以後再來借新歌劇的基礎求話劇的新動向和電影的新發展。</p>
<p>王先生感覺話劇的「此路不通的方向而另找出路」。這當然只限於王先生自己，或王先生之所謂「我們」。話劇的路走得通走不通。又豈能因王先生這樣輕描淡寫一言而决？努力話劇的人們，那裏又會因爲王先生以爲「此路不通」也就跟着以爲此路不通呢？要是這樣，那未免太缺乏自信力了。至於新歌劇是否一定是走得通？或通到那裏去？此刻正難預料，這完全要看王先生此後努力的結果如何，方能决定。假如新歌的路又走不通。王先生當然又會另找出路的。到那時誰又知道王先生對於新歌劇的論調不會和今日對話劇的論調一樣呢？</p>
<p>鄙人對此事的見解不過如此如此。我最希望的是：認爲「話劇是藝術」，認爲「話劇之路走得通」，認爲「話劇的演出，不必須新歌劇有了基礎即有一種新動向」，認爲「電影藝術，不必須新歌劇有了基礎，就可以得到一種新發展」的人們。應該埋着頭，鼓着勇氣，腳踏寔地的向前進。將來拿事寔上的成績來給國人看。到那時所有對話劇的一切似楚而非的理論，都可以不攻自破了。</p>
<p>我也希望王先生和王先生的「我們」，盡忠努力於新歌劇的早日成功。不必拿不必要的理論向各方面挑戰。假如努力話劇的人們，不從寔際努力，而只一味的以以對舊劇來標榜自已。那我們就不能眾說努力新歌劇以及從事舊戲的人專門詆毀話劇以抬高自己身價相號召是無聊了！我們應該相信：「道人之短，不必就能顯己之長」！即令能够，這種手段，也不能算高明的。如果當這新歌劇的影子都還沒有。話劇也還未十分發達的時候。大家就岡得島烟瘴氣。那麼話劇固然會不幸而如王先生所言一百年趕也不能仿效歐美。恐怕新歌劇也永遠沒有上東洋人的一天。闊甚麽呢？眞要笑死東洋人嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c161">一萬五千人痴如狂　中華榮得萬國杯　上半時中華表演失常　葡萄牙一比零佔上風　結果三比二驚險萬狀 <a href="#c161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>中華足球隊昨在極慌亂極不如意之局面中、幾乎敗於葡萄牙、幸下半時稍形振作、方以三比二擊敗葡隊、奪得業已放棄三年之萬國杯、上半時中華陣綫紊亂之狀、得未曾見、前鋒與內衛、慌張失措、更以球運不佳、一籌莫展、反被葡隊攻入一球、下半時一刻鐘內、仍無起色、李義臣踢十二碼球、竟亦不中、觀衆焦急之狀、不可言喻、自葡萄牙守門自己失手、負一球後、中華形勢乃稍有轉機、接後李義臣孫錦順又各建一功、最後葡萄牙罰入十二碼球、乃成三比二之結果、局勢雖十分緊張、但表演極少精彩、葡萄牙實力强勁、攻守堪稱平均、僅守門庸弱、左翼稍差耳、柯拉沙與谷司坦穩健老練、英勇如昔、中華隊在上半時、各人表演、一無可取、孫錦順雖甚賣力、但一事無成、下半時一刻鐘後、方入適可狀態、遂能獲勝、申園四周看台、擠得水洩不通、座前空地、亦均軋滿、後來者無立足之地、羣衝入塲內、圍坐四面邊界外、總數在一萬五千人以上、爲本年足球季第一次盛况、見上半時中華健兒表演之失常、怨聲不絕、如熱鍋底上螞蟻、焦灼萬狀、及至最後得勝、西聯會長葛林姆旭授萬國杯與中華隊長李寗以後、一種熱烈如狂、歡天喜地之狀、更不可以形容矣、兩隊出塲陣綫如下、</p>
<p>中華隊</p>
<p>徐亨</p>
<p>李寗　江善敬</p>
<p>顧尙勷　馮運佑　梁樹棠</p>
<p>萬象華　李義臣　戴麟經　孫錦順　賈幼良</p>
<p>葡萄牙</p>
<p>蘇柴</p>
<p>馬山爾　維克脫爾</p>
<p>雷米狄　考斯塔　F拿脫</p>
<p>C岡賽夫　L岡賽夫　柯拉沙　法凡笑　A拿脫</p>
<p>手忙腳亂為狀可怕</p>
<p>葡萄牙開球先攻、試探無效、顧尙勷還送前方、萬象華傳中失的、葡萄牙全軍侵入國軍禁地、左衝右突、十分可怕、中華內衛備覺生疏、手忙脚亂、不能呼應、葡右翼拿脫、兩次失機、法凡怯雄心勃勃、攻破兩關、授與柯拉沙、柯對門衝去、幸徐亭機警、奔出擋住、並罰柯拉沙任意球、方得脫險、谷司坦捲土重來、葡軍包抄而上、中華門前、十分危急、幸江善敬保駕得法、未遭意外、賈幼良得戴中鋒之輸送、送球敵陣、守門慌張、予中華兩次角球機會、無功而還、葡萄牙攻勢甚烈、柯拉沙尤爲可怕、中華於極不景氣之守衛綫中、幸得苟安過去、</p>
<p>中華隊隊長李寗手捧萬國杯　（朱順麟攝）</p>
<p>球運不佳無可奈何</p>
<p>中華前鋒一如內衛之紊亂不振、徒作孤軍之奮鬥、徒勞往返、一事無成、孫錦順一次殺入、射成野球、義臣攻鬥、球掠門右、賈幼良奔上一脚、碰然一聲、球應聲入門、但裁判員鳴笛判作越位、中華懊喪之餘、孫錦順再度深入、在雷米狄脚旁截球衝出、竄至門前、用力掃去、詛料正對守門、被其安然救出、又一次老孫將球送至門前、戴麟經趕上未着、幾次機會、均不得逞、球運不佳、無可奈何、</p>
<p>一球之失四座愕然</p>
<p>李義臣又一度射門、地位雖好、無奈脚頭不準、徒呼負負、葡萄牙否極泰來、拿脫邊疆起義、抄至中華腹地、顧尙勷阻擋不住、被其送球門前、江善敬緊守門邊、球在鬥側十五碼處落下、岡山夫無人監視、從容射門、竟應聲而中、四座爲之愕然、而中華球員亦驚惶萬分、力圖振作、益覺荒亂無措、中衛綫因此不敢前去、困守家園、前鋒乃更爲孤單、徒予對方機會、中華遂陷於四面楚歌中、前鋒雖有攻門、亦均交臂失之、幸上半時時間已至、得以略事休息、重振旗鼓、</p>
<p>十二碼球交臂失去</p>
<p>解渴以後、中華形勢略好、但仍在不如意中、孫錦順得小萬來球、衝入無人之地、離門僅七八碼、牛刀小試、以爲馬到成功、安知操之過急、又交臂失之、嘆惜之聲、起於四座、麟經心雄萬夫、不甘屈服、殺至門前、得罰十二碼球機會、觀者如服一劑淸凉散、當可以如願以償矣、李義臣邁步而進、向門角着地踢去、竟成野球、怨聲不入、球運之惡、一至於此、觀衆與球員、焦急之狀、無可名言、</p>
<p>否極泰來連得兩球</p>
<p>十五分鐘時、顧尙勷邊界擲球、投與李義臣、李順勢挑至門前、葡隊守門接住、跨出一步、將欲踢出、不料手中一鬆、球脫手落地、鬼使神差、球竟向背後滾入門內、戴麟經猶趕至門內、猛力一脚、一洩胸中之恨、觀者喜出望外、一股怨氣、方得一洩無餘、爆竹之聲、起於四座、從此中華聲勢大盛、精神抖擻、一洗先前紊亂不振之病、前後呼應、聯絡有方、對方守門原係平庸之輩、覩狀驚惶無措、一次出界之球、前去接住、致成角球、小萬送出甚佳、義臣門下一頂而入、甚爲淸晰、中華乃轉憂爲喜、反敗爲勝、觀衆如獲至寳、如痴如狂、</p>
<p>再接再厲又立一功</p>
<p>葡萄牙至此、陣容略亂、更以馬山兒傷腳、改任左內鋒、由雷米狄調回、左內鋒岡山夫則補雷米狄之缺、力主保守、中華方興未艾、葡隊陣綫、因此瓦解、門前密佈中華人馬、一如上半時葡軍之困中華、萬象華得義臣之球、向門前射去、球在敵內衛維克透身上彈回、老孫竄前刦後、運動鐵腿、對門猛射、球騰空飛入門內、爲狀至美、中華乃以三比一佔極優形勢、從此還我河山、可無疑義矣、</p>
<p>負十二碼江山已保</p>
<p>時間尙餘一刻鐘、雙方似有精疲力竭之狀、仍努力奮鬥、不稍鬆弛、戴得孫球、力衝門下、原可趁早攻門、意欲衢進門去、反被雷米狄趕上軋出、守門乃救球而出、葡隊全軍入寇、有破釜沉舟之勢、李寗欲搶法凡怯之球、反被罰十二碼、由谷司坦主踢、一掃而入、成三比二、葡軍猶猛攻不已、力謀恢複失地、柯拉沙法凡怯均有可怕之射門、幸而不中、中華遂以三比二奏凱、再度奪回萬國杯、</p>

<p>鄭兆佳昨晚表演　似已較往日進步、動作與出球、敏捷及速力、俱巳加增、若干網前半空球、博得掌聲不少、惟發球仍有雙錯誤、尙未臻最佳境、壓殺亦尙顯有較弱、與卡爾生之技藝、同在水平綫之間、兆佳尙在年少力强之時、將來漫遊歐美回來、技藝當可刮目相看也、</p>
<p>單雙打比賽情形　單打、卡爾生先開球、得勝一局、鄭兆佳轉手連勝三盤、以三比一居前、復成四比二、然第八局鄭竟失去自己之發球局、反被以五比四超出、直至七比七後、鄭連勝二局成九比七先勝一盤、第二盤卡爾生驟見勇猛、四比一而六比二奪回、成各一和局、雙打繼之、鄭兆佳狄米屈理維夫人對卡爾生卜德、狄爲一九三〇年全美女子冠軍、技術在一般普通男子之上、故形勢至爲緊張、始終以一局相上下、最後卡爾生連放三記野球結束、僅賽一盤、十五比十三、鄭狄得勝、</p>

<p>息影滬濱之蔣百里氏、年來潛心研究本國文化史、極有心得、昨日署名「一十宣言」之十敎授、聯袂走訪蔣氏於央雅潔之書齋、蔣氏精神煥發、談笑風生、猶是緩帶輕裘氣度、蔣氏先殷懃欵諸敎授以佳肴與美釀、殆酒酣耳熟之際、乃發表下述長篇之談話、語重心長、極足資全國靑年參考、爰詳記之如下、</p>
<p>國家士氣銷沉到如此地位、要不指出眞正一條路綫、一件法寳、誰還能相信、唯心耶、東方文化耶、禪家的心性、宋儒的理氣、移植於東方、以養成所謂武士道、而出產地之中國則無役不失敗也、唯物耶、西方文化耶、瓦德之機器愛迪生之電氣、在他人以之殖國富揚國威、以建設所謂資本主義、五十年前之日本亦一次殖民地耳、而較日本輸入西洋文化更早之中國、則農村宣吿破產、工廠要求救濟、人之無良、百藥罔效耶、果爾則華旗一名詞、早應消滅於數百年以前、而何以時至今日、猶有此一大羣衆生息於大陸、我們且檢討過去、找出華旗的眞實本領是什麼、</p>
<p>我於民旗之興衰、自世界有史以來以迄今日、發現一根本原則、曰「生活條件與戰鬥條件一致者强、相離者弱、相反者亡、生活與戰鬥本是一件東西從兩方面看、但依經濟及戰鬥的狀態之演進、時時有分離之趨勢、希臘羅馬雖在歐洲取得文化先進美名、但今日繼承希臘羅馬文化的却並不是當年的希臘人羅馬人、俱有偉大的文化而卒至衰亡的總原因、就是生活工具與戰鬥工具的不一致、</p>
<p>生活條件與戰鬥條件之一致有因天然的工具而不自覺的成功者、有史以來只有二種、一爲蒙古人的馬、一爲英國人的船、因覓水草就利用馬、因爲營商業就運用船、馬與船就是吃飯傢伙、同時可就是打仗的像伙、因此就兩度征服世界、有費盡心血用人爲制度而成功者、也只有兩種、一爲歐戰時才發明、十年來才實行、西人的國家動員、一爲中國三千年前已經實施的井田封建、他的眞精神就是生活條件與戰鬥條件之一致、</p>
<p>封建不是部落割據、（近人指割據部落思想爲封建思想者、係用名詞的誤謬）是打破部落割據的一種工具、封就是殖民、建就是生活（經濟）戰鬥（國防）一致的建設、井田不是講均產（在當時也不是一件奇事）是一種又可種田吃飯又可出兵打仗（在當時就是全國總動員）的國防制度、懂得這個道理的創制的是周公、——繼承的是管仲（左傳、齊之境內、盡東其畝、就可證明田制與軍制國防之關係、）——最後成功的是商鞅、」這是我發見出來的華族的眞本領、諸公若能系統的叙述出來、使靑年感覺到我華族固有的本領之偉大、從前可以統一亞洲大陸、將來何嘗不可以統一世界、或許於現代銷沉的士氣有點補救、（未完）</p>

<p>鐵甲車，是胡先生的綽號，不過我們見到這三個字，就要周身血管爆裂引起陣陣的隱痛了！胡先生有這個綽號，表面似乎怪好玩的，唉！傷心得很，只不過始於一二八以後呀：我們沒有見到鐵甲車賜予的創痕，顯不到它的厲害，說不定這件烽烟利器，在以前還有許多人呌不出這個名兒咧；胡先生是位運動家，是淸季體操學校第一屆畢業生，他今年五十有五歲，寓居上海數十年，獨自行路，從不依賴車輛，每次業餘競走運動，都有他老人家參加，他平居散步，亦如衝鋒陷陣般奔跑，所御革履，異於常式，其聲槖槖，活像鐵甲車馳逐；他穿皮鞋有統計，先後凡一百二十五雙；善綱筆畫，柳枝書，前年爲本刋鵑翁，也繪寫過一幅扇面；他擅攝影，他會音樂，是位多才多藝的運動家，直到現在，還擔任着體育敎員；他身上的一絲一縷，都異於常人，一副窄邊金絲眼鏡從最新式，變到最古式，由最古式，又變到今日的最摩登了；他是自由戀愛，夫人爲他讀書時代追逐成功的女學生，舉行文明婚禮，在上海是原始的第六位；他睡覺，一醒就起，不復再睡，說是復睡如餘興，適可而止，不需要這個了；所以不論寒燠溫淸，總是四點鐘起身，他由西門方斜路走到閘北滬太汽車站，兜一個轉，還在淸晨的八點鐘：他的雨傘，上節去頂竿，下節去柄竿，只有傘布的面積，捲一層新聞紙，挾在腋下，輕便玲瓏，晴天遮日，雨天當雨；其餘的一切，都很別致；因此學生們又稱他「文明先生。」</p>

<p>— 渡雲</p>
<p>在上海有幾種特殊職業，是內地所不經見的，「挖陰溝」其一也。因爲馬路旁的陰溝，雖爲容納雨水而設，但平時不免有過往行人，漫不經意的落下錢幣飾物等類。或爲損失有限，不値得撈取；或爲遺落時，連本人都未曾知覺，於是有一種「挖陰溝」者應運而生，向之謀衣食飯盌了！</p>
<p>在馬路兩旁的陰溝洞比較深些！那一挖陰溝」者，務要一搭一擋，繞可活動。一個手拿竹竿，竿頭縛上一只舀子，先挪開陰溝蓋，把竹竿盡量揷入，透底舀起，拖泥帶水，傾倒在洞邊；另一個快手摸索，揀出銅元銀角等類，丟入一隻罐中。手叚要敏捷，眼光要銳利。挖了一洞又一洞，從容不迫地幹，一天二人平均可分得半元多錢。</p>
<p>弄堂裏的陰溝，比較淺些！只要一個人，捲起了衣袖伸手向內摸索便可。依他們的經騐，當以汕頭路小花園大慶里一帶爲肥缺，半月摸上一次，每洞可有銅元八九十枚，因爲書寓中人，往往午夜送迎，黑夜中常有銅元銀角，失手掉下，溜入陰溝中的緣故。</p>
<p>「挖陰溝」已是一種特殊職業了，但還有靠掃垃圾刷灰塵當出息的。據說在銀樓中，每年有人願貼上幾百元錢，承受垃圾灰塵，不但天天會來掃凈地面，連墻上的塵埃桌上的垢穢，都會代你揩刷；甚至連銀匠身上穿的舊衣服，脚上套的舊鞋子，也願送你新的，換你舊的去。因爲銀樓中，金銀碎屑，四處飛散，他們會用盡方法，收歛起來，把他無中生有，獲利還是很厚呢！</p>

<p>這種蛾也分着雌雄兩性，就把它們在一個竹盤裏混着。這個竹盤就算是它們的世界了；除掉這竹盤以外，它們便接觸不到旁的東西了。而它們自己，也似乎沒有什麽野心想到竹盤外面去；就是這個竹盤的內容，究竟有多少大，對於它們是否安全，它們也是一槪不管的。更奇怪的是它們和別的蟲類不同，變成了蛾之後，便什麼東西都不要吃了；它們的活動，只是揀好了搭配，互相交尾。交過了一次尾，那雄的就先死了，獨讓那些雌的留着，以完成它產子的任務。這時侯又得讓育蠶的女孩們先把那些已死的雄蛾揀出來棄去，以免阻礙。在那竹盤的底下，原是早就舖好了白紙的，過得一天或兩天，雌蛾就在紙上實行產子了；隔一夜再去看時，只見紙上巳滿散着無數黑芝蔴似的蠶子和許多已死的雌蛾。當然，它們也就不再需要而立卽被棄去了。</p>
<p>「你不是覺得很有趣嗎？眞的！這不啻是一幅人生的縮影圖！」太后用一種富於哲學意味的語調說道：「它們從出身起，忽忽地做完了一生應做的工作，便很急遽地死了。其間祗隔了短短的一二十天工夫。但這一二十天功夫，對於它們，却和我們從鑽出娘胎，由幼而少，由少而壯，由壯而成中年，老年，以至於死，實在是沒有什麼區別的！」（二七六）</p>

<p>— 上海通社</p>
<p>翻翻史書，我們發覺那從前官塲重要人物，很多做過上海道的：消代全史不談，光拿近代史來說，就有這幾個：</p>
<p>（一）呂海寰　他係在光緖二十二年任上海道，但到光緒二十九年間，已經是淸政府的商約大臣。那時，上海革命運動，初初開展，他即函致蘇撫恩壽吿密，謂：「上海租界有所謂熱心少年者，在張園聚衆議事，名爲拒法拒俄，實則希圖作亂。」當即指名查拿，蔡元培，吳敬恒，章炳麟，鈕永建。雖未經工部局許可，但其後卒造成轟動一時的蘇報案。</p>
<p>（二）蔡鈞　他係在光緖二十三年任上海道，但到光緒二十八年間，已經是淸政府駐日公使。那時，章炳麟等爲鼓吹種族革命，振起歷史觀念起見，發起「支那亡國二百四十二年紀念會於東京，留日學界爲之震動。他極形恐慌，乃親訪日外務省，要求將該會解散。日政府徇其請，乃有大批留學人士被迫回國，而在上海，有愛國學社的設立和中國公學的創辦。</p>
<p>（三）瑞澂　他係在光緖三十二年任上海道，但到辛亥革命武昌起義時，已經是湖廣總督。那時，他先接得淸政府外務部密電，略謂；「革黨黃興約期起事」等語，於是嚴密查防，捕獲黨員數人。他以爲革命機關己破，可無大患，頗形得意。武昌向有新軍萬六千人，分編步隊，馬隊，砲隊三種，平時本懷怨望，至是，瑞澂又以嫌疑恣意搜捕。遂於八月十九日發動，瑞棄城而逃。</p>
<p>以上係擇其重要的說一說，其他次要的，不及備舉。</p>

<p>— 衛生署屯生敎育系主任朱繼靑講（成心良筆記）</p>
<p>（一）工作人員的訓練。訓練多量的醫務護士工作人員以期達到公醫的制度。</p>
<p>（二）醫學敎育。敎育醫務護士人才。以積極的醫學觀念。</p>
<p>（三）民衆敎育。單是上面的敎育不够。醫學不是秘寳。不是醫生的私產。乃是人類所公有的產業。所以醫學。是絕對公開的。並且是日常應用的。我們知道幾千年來。醫學簡直是像秘寳一樣。玄妙得不可言宣。由其最近三十年來的所謂科學醫。更加是把他當做傳家之寳。黃金事業。有誰知道一點醫學而應用的話。就等於犯了死罪。無疑的。這是人類的自私。但是現在要把們打倒了。要把他們消滅了。醫學從此要公開了。不是少許人的法寳了。從此人人都有應用醫學的權利了。從此以後的醫師。所給予我們的。不是單純的針與藥。而是一種眞正賜予。而含有敎育的醫學。從此人類的健康與生存的問題。有了保障了。—這是醫學項點的價。也就是醫學的—積極時期．</p>
<p>（五）公共衛生的進化</p>
<p>上面關於醫學與社會的關係。及其觀念的改變。我們已有了相當的明瞭。現在再說到公共衛生本身上的進化。</p>
<p>公共衛生四字。大槪是醫學走到以不健康爲對象的時期中創始的。在這時期。人類覺得健康是絕對的需要。健康又不是單靠吃藥了。必須要有某種整個兒的計劃。於是乃漸漸注意到衛生的一方面。我們歸納呌做公共衛生。</p>
<p>公共衛生的進化。又可分爲四個歷程。</p>
<p>（一）環境衛生。這時期大槪在十八世紀開始。這世紀內細菌學和消毒術。都發明了。（巴士徒氏發明細菌李斯特氏發明消毒術）其他的發明。如解剖生理學的進展。愛克司光的發明。好像雨後春笋。頭角齊露。科學權威。人類的光榮</p>
<p>這時人們知道。致病是由於一種微小而目不能見的微生物。一細菌。這微生物大多是存在人們四週環境之內的。所以這時的衛生專家。乃以環境改良為辦衛生第一要旨。如自來水與其他飲水料之改善。下水道之設置。垃圾之處理。街市之淸潔等。這是公共衛生初步的雛形。文明先進國如英法喘士。最初都是做的這些工作。</p>
<p>（二）預防疾病。這是最近七十年以內的事。醫學家認爲環境衛生。祗是公共衛生的一部分。要保健人類。須要防止疫癘的侵襲。於是種痘之廣泛而大膽的利用。各種預防接種的自動與被動的菌苗與血淸。如白喉抗毒素傷寒疫苗。赤利血淸之發明。—是細菌所致的病。都可預防接種免毒或抗毒。其他如消毒隔離等。也都應用得很好。</p>
<p>公共衛生已是大大的進步了。</p>
<p>（三）早期診療。到現在還有許多病。不是細菌的作祟。乃是生理組織的病變。如癌腫扁桃體腫脤。牙齒缺陷等。都是組織單純的病變。如能早期診斷。而加以治療的癌。是可以全好的。</p>
<p>公共衛生的進化。是這般的驚人。</p>
<p>（四）民衆敎育。我在上面說過。醫學是大衆的日常需用物一樣。不是少數醫生私有的產物。而且醫生也是管不了許多的。我得聲明。我並不是好像看不起醫生。而且科學而心理健全（眞道德）的醫師。我是特別欽仰的。不過我的意思是說。醫學與防病的知識與經騐。是大家都要知道。並且要協助實行的。我自己也是醫生。决不敢妄自菲薄。一顆赤裸裸的心。剖在大家的面前。一點秘密也沒有。大家看吧。這是醫學。這是人類大衆的醫學。—醫生是處於研究和指導的地位。民衆是站在體騐的地位。</p>
<p>公共衛生進化到這個時期。也可算到了項點。</p>
<p>（五）預防的醫學。公共衛生。旣然。隨着社會的動力。進展到項點的地位，—我們不敢說不能再進步。但是我們已積極的幹去。</p>
<p>我說過讀了歷史。就可以知道許多的經騐。我們可以把這些經騐變成我們的經騐。我們就可以迎頭趕上去。少跑寃枉路。</p>
<p>同時我們又可以知道西洋文明先進國。他們的死亡率。較我們低得多。壽命率也比我們高得多。他們因此能使國家富强。地位增高。反看看我們家裏。是怎麼樣呢。彎腰曲肩。黃面瘦肌。死亡高。壽命低。可痛呀！</p>
<p>所以我們今後辦理公共衛生的目的乃是要：</p>
<p>减少死亡。加添人壽。增進健康。改造民族。增高國際地位。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c194">皮膚的衛生和皮膚病的預防（四） <a href="#c194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— 謝筠壽</p>
<p>第三是肥皂。吾人當洗滌的時侯。往往用了肥皂。容易把塵垢等不潔物除去。令皮膚完全淸潔。所以肥皂對皮膚的衛生上是很重要。因之他的種類和功効。也就不能不明瞭。</p>
<p>肥皂的成分。用阿爾如里鹽類（就是鈉滷汁或加里滷汁）和脂肪混和後煮沸而成功的。是一種化學的混合物。可以分做兩種。就是鈉肥皂和加里肥皂。鈉肥皂的質地柔軟。加里肥皂的質地硬。還有一種是阿爾加里和脂肪充分混和的。這呌做中和肥皂。他的作用。最爲和緩</p>
<p>肥皂溶解到水裏面。可以發生泡沫。塗擦到皮膚上面。不但能够溶解皮膚面上的脂肪。而且還能够令皮膚上的角層膨脹柔軟。容易剝離。所以附著的塵埃和汚物。也容易除去。凡是阿爾加里性愈强的肥皂。他的作用也愈强。但是硬水不適於肥皂的應用。倘使必須使用的時候。最好使之煮沸。這時候的肥皂。對於皮膚的淸潔。雖有効力。但應當適度。倘過度使用。反有害於皮膚。因爲皮膚薄而且脂肪少的時候。濫用肥皂。把皮膚的皮脂奪去。失去光澤。變成乾燥粗糙。容易發生皸裂和濕疹。所以皮膚薄和皮脂缺乏的人。最好不多用肥皂。就是要用的時候。也應當選擇緩和的一種。倘使也不適當的時候。可，以改用糠汁。反之皮脂多的人。應當常用肥皂。就是稍强的一種。也沒有妨碍。皮膚的性質。又隨著部位有不同。例如頭部毛髮豐富。皮脂也多。可以施用强的加里肥皂。此地所講的强弱。就是指著肥皂性質和作用。最合于理想的肥皂。是中和性的鈉肥皂。可以常用。沒有妨碍。選擇肥皂的條件有兩種。第一就是製造肥皂的時候。不可混和有種種的副產物。第二不可有遊離過分的阿爾加里。倘使有遊離阿爾加里的時侯。刺戟皮膚。且鹹化表皮的脂肪。令皮膚粗糙。但是肥皂良否的檢定。實際上很困難。最好各自試用。如果試用以後。皮膚沒有意外的刺戟，乾燥，粗糙，緊張等感覺。大概不至會有過量的阿爾加里了。</p>
<p>以上爲普通施用的肥皂。還有一種呌做藥用肥皂的。就是上面所講的一種加里肥皂。他的阿爾加里很强。不適于普通的使用。只可作爲藥用。以除去多量的皮脂，塵埃和落屑。其他所講的藥用肥皂。就是含有種種的藥物。這不適于普通皮膚的衛生。是用于特別有皮膚病的時候。</p>
<p>藥用肥皂使用的目的。爲皮膚局所療法的補助。例如痤瘡，皮脂漏，寄生性疾病（白癬，瘢瘋等）。倘使不問病症的如何。忘自使用。反有種種的弊害。又商人因爲營利的關係。往往品質不正。同時在廚窗中長時存放。這不但不適于應用。而且還因藥品成分的變性。他的揮發性物質也消散。變成無効力。所以這樣的藥用肥皂。還是不用爲妙。</p>
<p>藥用肥皂因爲藥品的性質不同。種類也很多。例如硼酸肥皂。性質最和緩。此外爹兒肥皂，硫磺肥皂，「那福他兒」肥皂等。對於皮脂漏，痤瘡，毛瘡和寄生虫皮膚病。都可應用。薄荷肥皂和石炭酸肥皂。對於痒疹和其他有瘙痒性的皮膚病。可以應用。但是新鮮急性症狀的時候。應當禁北。魚石脂肥皂對于皮脂漏，痤瘡，酒法鼻等。可以應用。海勃賴氏加里肥皂精（加里肥皂和酒精等分混和）可以除去頭部表皮的剝屑及頭脂。最適于淸潔。所以有多量頭脂（俗呌做頭花）的人。最爲相宜。以上所講的藥用肥皂。和使用普通的肥皂相同。也用熱水洗滌。並且須把泡沫充分洗去</p>
<p>普通使用肥皂洗滌的時候。因熱水比較冷水爲好。但是同時應當注意皮膚的感受性。就是對于過敏性的皮膚。肥皂的使用。務宜節制。否則顏面的皮膚。可以變成粗糙。倘用水洗滌。使皮膚粗糙的時候。要緩和洗滌水（尤以硬水的時候）的刺戟。可以加些硼砂（半面盆的水裏面加兩茶匙）或硼酸（二茶匙）</p>
<p>有一種人洗面的時侯。往往加些牛乳。這對於過敏粗糙的皮膚。很爲相宜。（就是三分的水中加入一分的煮沸牛乳）因爲利用牛乳中的脂肪。去遮蔽皮膚。可以避去水的刺戟。有保護的作用。</p>
<p>有病皮膚的洗滌。以避去爲宜。就是要洗滌的時候。也要極端注意。决不可爲刺載性的摩擦。並且</p>
<h2>Page 16</h2>
<p>洗滌的時間宜短同，拭乾以後。再用粉末散布。令他充分乾燥。又顏面的皮膚過敏的人。洗滌以後。不可卽刻出外。接觸外氣。故洗滌以晚上爲宜。（完）</p>
<h3 id="c195">現在松江醫藥衛生概況 <a href="#c195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— 傅積仁</p>
<p>（五）醫師程度</p>
<p>在松開業醫師之資格，大別有八：（一）由日本千葉醫大畢業者。（二）由國立同濟大學畢業者。（三）由前江蘇省立醫專畢業者，（四）由上海東南醫學院畢業者，（五）由浙江省立醫藥專校畢業者。（六）由杭州廣濟醫校畢業者，（七）由護士而領得通字醫師執照者，（八）由各醫院實習後開業者，醫師道德觀念尙佳，無派別分歧，然每有登載廣吿以虛吹私人之設備若何而實際殊缺乏者。</p>
<p>（六）診金與藥資</p>
<p>（甲）診金：醫院均分施診，門診，特診，及出診四項。施診大多爲銅元十枚。門診則小洋四角，大洋四角，大洋半元不等。特診爲大洋一元，出診大洋二元。逾時則加倍。私人診所，各人不同。有爲小洋四角者，有爲半元者。有於星期日或每日何時兼施診以嘉惠貧民者。</p>
<p>（乙）藥資。。松地醫師，均自備配藥室，蓋藥房並不配方也。取費每多不同。如縣立醫院，外藥分大中小三種瓷盒，每種各爲若干。內服藥則以服食之日數爲標準。如一日量爲大洋三角者，則二日爲六角，餘類推；並非視藥爲之價目爲標準，實甚好笑也。他醫院或醫師，則各不一。如注射劑，一列取費二元。故病人之受注射者實甚寥寥。若爲黃色素之類，則三四元不等。九一四爲四五元左右。如藥品自購，則取手術費一二元不等。</p>
<p>（七）產科</p>
<p>產科設有醫院者凡三。。一爲崇華，一爲平正，一爲德瓊醫院附設之保產醫院。以崇華爲最聞名，且設一分院。院長爲孫崇華女醫師，杭州廣濟學校畢業者，學識經騐，均甚豐富。在松可謂首屆一指之新醫產科。此院開辦巳有甚久之歷史，甚得松民之信仰，全城共有開業之助產士七位。上述之四醫院，均設有產科附屬部，而聘請之助產士一二人不等。</p>
<p>松民之對於新醫產科，尙能信任。取費亦各人不同，約爲四人，六元，八元，有時則視病家之經濟狀况而有增减，惜不能十分普及，要以智識階級者爲多。至於住院者較少，若爲難產，當作別論。本縣並無公立之平民產科醫院，是爲缺點！</p>
<p>（八）新藥業</p>
<p>松江新藥業共五家，計有南洋，濟華堂，華美，中英及大五洲。南洋爲專營藥業，而所備藥品亦較他家爲多，內更附設三醫師之分診所。其他四家，則均兼賣化妝品，尤其大五洲藥房，乃與一中國參號合設一處，二面橱窗中分別陳列中西藥品，相映成趣，驟視之，不能辨其爲中爲西，各家均無正式藥劑師可以配方，余曾親至各藥房擬配一方，見則各店均用學徒招待主顧，除三數人外，均爲不識不懂外國原名之學徒作作西藥之販賣員，不亦笑話乎？所有藥品，以國貨價廉之成藥爲多。有許多普通之藥品，蚤城不能買到，如甘草膠（Sucus　Liguiri　Siae明礬棒（Alaumstiift）過氣化鐵溶液（Liq　Ferri　Sesquichlorati）等，使余初抵松江之客地業醫者，不能處方矣，誠有苦無訴處。本刋曾載淮陰縣之藥房中可以購得另拆針藥，松江亦然。其價與原裝較，或有一與二之比，此種現象，據余調查之所得，實松地有未獲得執照之醫師，專門以打針爲業者所造成。</p>

<h3 id="c197">止痛的醫學（七） <a href="#c197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— 李興</p>
<p>胃痛</p>
<p>熟煮肉類，肉湯各種食物總當淡味爛煮。粗的靑菜（多纖維的菜）與辣味酸味五香料等免去爲宜。務設法使滋養料充足使病者健康日增抵抗力日高，胃痛停止胃瘡可以全愈。</p>
<p>止胃瘡痛的藥品最要緊的就是鹼性與抗酸的。我們曉得胃酸使胃瘡痛，但胃酸是消化的要素。用鹼性與抗酸藥品使胃酸成爲中和性。如此胃瘡不受胃酸激刺胃瘡就可以不痛。此種方法是在胃瘡處除去神經接觸器的激刺，並不是麻醉胃瘡更不是麻醉大腦。這是有益無害的止胃痛的方法。由此更可見鴉片嗎啡之單麻醉大腦是屬於欺騙的止痛方法。明白了這種基本的原理我知明理的國民决不選擇麻醉品以欺己害己。未上麻醉毒品當的望勿嘗試，其已上當的宜急起戒除，胃痛時採行科學止痛法。此卽所謂，「苦海無邊回頭是岸一。</p>
<p>鹼性與抗酸藥品之最有效者卽，下炭酸鉍，養化鎂，炭酸鈣，小蘇打等。這些藥品的效力有的時侯長些有的時侯短些故配合服用爲最宜。還有貝拉當那及其餘藥品等亦有益於胃痛祇在服用得當與否。</p>
<p>胃瘡穿破胃瘡穿破的意思，卽胃瘡穿一洞，使胃之內部與胃之腹腔相通，胃內的流質同時也可以流到腹腔內。這是一種很餒重的毛病。爲什麼呢？胃內的流質到腹腔內就要發生腹膜炎。這種腹膜炎是非常危險的，這種毛病治的不得當，眞是至少九死一生。</p>
<p>當胃瘡穿洞時與穿洞以後，病人腹之上部就要發生很猛烈的痛，病者痛苦難堪。這種病是一切「緊急腹病」“RcuteAbdomen”中很要緊的一種。按照治療「緊急腹病」的原則是應當立即施救的。但病人或病人家中的人所要的是止痛！止痛自然是應當的，但到底用什麼方法止痛？吃止痛藥片麽？打嗎非針麽？吸鴉片麽？答，吃止痛藥片沒有用處。打嗎啡針，吸鴉片，可以止痛，因爲麻醉品可以把病人腦筋麻醉過去，呌他不曉得痛。現在，比方一個人看見自己財產失火，就急的不得了，但若把他麻醉了，他就可以不驚不懼得意自若。那末，縱他心裏安泰袖手旁觀，到底火不還是把他的財產燒完麼？打嗎啡針吸鴉片止這種的痛也是一樣。這種痛固然當止，但不是止了痛就算了事，因爲不把這種病根本治好這個人就是不受痛了也要死</p>
<p>講起來很簡單，祇要高明外科醫師證明了是胃瘡穿洞，就應立時施行外科手術，將胃瘡洞縫好，病者才可轉危爲安。據多年來外科的經騐，胃瘡穿破後祇有十二個小時可以挽救生命的機會。十二小時後就可算九死一生。後胃瘡穿洞的時候起，每等一小時就要加增一部分危險，時間越長，危險越多，生命希望也越少。萬不可單求麻醉止痛而拖延時間，以求避免外科手術挽救。按照原則，穿洞十二小時後，就是施行外科手術，生命希望也是很少。有劇烈胃痛的，對於這種基本科學，不可不格外留意</p>
<p>盲腸痛盲腸痛由於盲腸炎。盲腸炎是一種平常的病。歐美人患這種病的較我國人爲多。但中國人患盲腸炎的也不過少。生活越文明化生盲腸炎的也越多。城市中人患者較鄉野人爲多。發生盲腸炎的原因雖不盡同，但大便閉結與消化不良當爲最重要的原因。其餘病理暫不多述。</p>
<p>盲腸發炎了就要痛。這種痛常是忽然臨身如禍從天降，一陣一陣的痛的不得了。痛的地位常在腹部自肚臍向下向右約兩三寸距離處。盲腸發炎性越急痛也越厲害。如係慢性發炎痛也平和。有時盲腸痛正劇烈時忽然停止，病者常受到假安慰以爲是腹痛霍然而愈。其實不然，這種病狀常是由盲腸發炎發腫致盲腸穿破，腹膜炎或腹內將發生局部膿腫。盲腸炎之最危險處就是由盲腸潰爛引起之腹膜炎。這種腹膜炎是非常危險的所以盲腸炎也是「急性腹病」中最要之一</p>

<p>— 唐仁縉</p>
<p>（四十）遠視眼與老視眼</p>
<p>遠視眼的成立。也是由前節所述的「眼能視物的理由」。而不能實施攝影機所具的機能而成。這種眼睛。亦係屬於非正視眼中的一種。換言之。就是具有一種不健全視力的眼球。她的能力。祇可遠視。不能近視。適與近視眼完全相反。因爲她的水晶體的凸度太小。或因她的眼軸太短。所以由光綫所生的物像。雖有虹彩收放的調度，水晶體的屈折，及她天然的調節作用。但是不能完全適合映在網膜的上面。反而映在網膜的後方（參照附圖）。所以凡近距離的物體。都不能明瞭看見。有了這種遠視的眼球。若在談書，寫字，或近距離工作的時候。當然亦須矯正眼鏡來輔助才是。這一種的矯正眼鏡。就是配用適宜的凸鏡。用以變換水晶體的屈折力。如是可使由水晶體屈折而來的物像。完全映在網膜的上面。此時眼球亦卽變爲具有健全正視眼的機能。可以在近距離明瞭視物。不過這種凸鏡的配置前。亦應經過眼科醫師詳細檢查眼內各部的情形。方爲妥當啊。</p>
<p>老視眼的成立。乃由年齡的關係所致。因爲老年的水晶體。可以漸次失去水分。彈力性亦减退。而變爲硬化。所以她的屈折光綫的能力。也就减弱。同時她的調節作用。亦遂不完全。具有這種眼球的結果。與遠視眼相像。也是不能明視近距離的物體。所以在讀書，寫字，或近距離工作的時候。亦須矯正眼鏡的輔助。這種矯正眼鏡。也就是一般俗問所用的老花眼鏡。</p>

<p>— 胡嘉言</p>
<p>滲出性和增生性的代表型式，在臨床上的經過情形，上面已經述過大槪了！但是在事實上，肺結核病的情形，差不多都是混雜不淸的，兩方面兼有的；純綷淸一色的型式，幾乎是沒有的。像增生性之移轉於滲出性，以及滲出性之變爲增生性，或轉愈而成硬變性的例子；在臨床上是時常看得見的。甚至在一個病例中，可以兼有滲出性增生性硬變性三種變化的。所以我們僅憑病者當時檢查之所得，就想對預後方面下一種必然的揣測，事實上確係不可能的。這一點，病家對醫者時常是不肯曲諒的；但如果明白上述的眞相時，我想總不至再有問題發生了！</p>
<p>末後，關於硬變性的型式和空洞在臨床上的經過情形，現在且略述一點。硬變性一型式，大多數是發生於增生性型式以後的。他的經過是慢性的，症象也不很嚴重。有時候和氣管枝炎症幾乎沒有分別的。有時病者因登高或动作，發生輕度呼吸困難，胸部疼痛，很可以怀疑到關節炎症的。物理的檢查所得，大半不很顯著；無熱度，血液檢查亦無甚異處，惟痰中有時可見結核菌的，此中最準確的認識，自不能不推X光的透视了！預後方面，也是佳者居多：除非是兼有滲出性或增生性的變化，那是屬諸例外的。</p>
<p>關於空洞如何構成，在第五章裏而已經講過了！患者在此時，主觀上的症象大致是沒有的；像溫度不增高，正常的血液圖像是。血液的沉降是較速一點，但，並無大關係。痰中現結核菌及彈力纖維，打診時現鼓音，這對診斷方面是很有關係的。他的經過，除開用外科治療手術外，太半是不能痊愈的；預後也不佳。其間因新結締組織的增生，而發生結疤狀况，有時也可見着；但屬諸極少數，爲期也是很長久的。（第九章完）</p>

<h3 id="c201">彈詞小說論 <a href="#c201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— 寒峯</p>
<p>彈詞小說，是南方的農民文學的一種，它的影響之大，誠如西諦所說，如大鼓書之在北方。這完全是爲婦女，賤民，不識之無的人們，所愛好，所喜悅的一種文學。可是，研究文學的人，是從來不大注意的，以爲是「算不得文學」，直到最近幾年，纔漸漸的被人提起</p>
<p>這就不能不使人感到吳研人李伯元的有可愛處了。他們雖同是封建的智識階級，生長於舊的時代，但他們對於彈詞文學的重要性，是充分理解的。李伯元寫作了一部六册的「庚子國變彈詞一，這不僅替一向把題材局限於男女私情的彈詞小說開拓了一條富有社會性的新路，也是中國反帝文學在彈詞方面的最初一部書。吳研人在這一方面雖沒有什麽寫作，也曾爲我們留下一點意見。在淸光緖三十一年刊行的一新小說一第二卷第七號「小說叢話裏，載有他論「彈詞小說」的一節，說是：</p>
<p>「彈詞曲本之類，粵人謂之『木魚書』，此等木魚書雖皆附會無稽之作，要其大旨，無一非陳述忠孝節義者。甚至演一妓女故事，亦必言其殉情人以死。其他如義僕代主受戮，孝女賣身代父贖罪等事，開卷皆是，無處蔑有，而而必得一極良之結局。婦人女子，習看此等書，遂暗受其敎育。惜乎此等木魚書，限於方言，不能遠播耳」。</p>
<p>彈詞小說在文學上的價値，吳研人雖不能有很好的估量，對此等著作的社會影響的廣大，是時不很淸楚的。他是不曾因襲的賤視這一類的作品。</p>
<p>在刻本的彈詞裏，差不多每一部都有一篇序，說明彈詞對於風俗人心關係的重大，和聽衆讀者之多。吳研人的道意見，是可以作爲代表的，只是棄去了「可以挑悶撥愁」的部分。所以，彈詞小說的發生，其目的是比他種的大衆文學更露骨的，更統一的，用一種具有音樂的形式，以擴大封建道德的影響。也就因爲「太統一」的原故，所有的彈詞小說，便不免於成爲一種定型的作品。吳研人的話，也曾談及到這一點。</p>
<p>彈詞小說，在文學上有些怎樣的價値呢？據西諦的意見是；「彈詞之叙述與描寫較之好述傳，隋唐演義諸書，不知高明了多少倍；即較之紅樓夢，金瓶梅諸書之喜叙瑣事者，亦更以描狀細物瑣情無微不至見長。以前，有人說過一個笑話，他說，聽人說唱彈詞，叙述一個婦人鞋帶散了俯下身體去扣上，說了一夜兩夜，道婦人的鞋帶還沒有扣好；這當然是含有些嘲笑之意的，然彈詞叙寫之細膩深切，於此益可見之。」這一描狀細物瑣情，無微不至，」確實是說明了彈詞的特點。顧有時，彈詞的作者，把這種方法運用得不當，使全書在文學的價値上受了損害，也是有之的，如「何必西廂」，用五卷書來寫一回結婚的塲面，就無論如何，不能不使聽衆讀者，有昏昏欲睡之感。</p>
<p>說到「何必西廂」，使我想起桐峯外史論「盲詞」的話，他說：一盲詞不知所自始，尙有朦誦遺風。元瞿存齋過汴梁詩：</p>
<p>陌間盲女無窮恨，能撥琵琶說趙家」，與沿街爭唱蔡中郞」同意。又宋陸放翁：斜陽古柳趙家莊，負瞽盲翁正作塲」。是盲詞由來舊矣。若其新聲雅韻，可詠可歌，按拍旗亭，何减小秦王調，原非村學究所作七字腔，徒供噴飯巳也」。</p>
<p>這是彈詞小說的史的追叙，和文學上的價値的說明。彈詞小說和他種的文學作品一樣，由於作者修養關係，是有優劣之分的，最好的，出入於詩詞歌曲之間，是無往而不通俗，無往而不雅韻，「詩髮緣」一書的成功即其一例。</p>
<p>一般的小說，我們是常常的把它分作長中短篇的，彈詞小說也是一樣。西諦說，彈詞小說，有的是多到四十冊，三部曲合起來的，可以超出七十本。我曾經見到一部抄本名「榴花夢」的，竟多至三百冊，可稱彈詞小說中之最大作品。據西諦說：這書福建有刋本，不知印成書究竟有若干册。大槪彈詞小說的長篇，總在三十冊以上，「天雨花」之類，中篇在十冊上，如「何必西廂」之類，四五册七八册的小書，如「還金鑼」等等，是祇能算作短篇的。此外，有「開篇」一種，和「詩髮緣」中所載，那不過是些零星的短章而已。</p>
<p>爲定型的題材與形式所决定，彈詞小說，和封建勢力一樣，巳經逐漸的向死路上走。李伯元雖然努力的開拓了一個新方向，九一八一二八雖然也產生了一點新的「開篇」，事實上是依舊不能有很好的開展。那麽，中國的彈詞小說，往後究竟向何處去呢？由於固有影響的他續，目前大概還是有保留這種形式，而加以改造的必要，不過，在將來，它的存在性，終歸是要根本喪失的，這是誰也可以作這種的預言。</p>
<h3 id="c202">戰爭與和平 <a href="#c202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— 胡依凡</p>
<p>戰爭，是一種原始的慘酷的殺戮，原是人所共曉的。從古文古詩中，咱們就已先有過許多這種悲凉的臉影，使人觸目驚心。如「弔古戰塲文」，及「可憐無定河邊骨，猶是春閨夢裏人」，「寗爲太平犬，毋爲亂離人」等等，這些膾炙人口的文章與詩，使人讀後，就會瞭然想到在鋒火的餘生中，那鱗鱗的白骨，那瓦鑠焦土的荒塲，那孤兒寡婦的生離死別的悲哀身世，凡此，都自然而然會容易引起人們對戰爭發生了一種厭惡的感情，而忘記了誰是戰爭的製造者和鼓動者。換句話說：他們已變得不知道爲什麼會有戰爭；但戰爭來了，給與他們的是祗有那樣的慘痛和絕滅，就祗好單純地厭惡戰爭、詛咒戰爭了。於是，明知戰爭之不能倖免，就要到來，但刀已臨到了自己頭上，還不能無幻想，夢囈着和平。同一錯誤的想頭，因爲對戰爭厭惡痛恨，就竟連自羣人的正常的自禦戰，反抗戰，也看成了是一種罪惡，爲不應有。前者之例，我們可以看目前一二年來所盛行的什麽「祈禱和平」之類；後者之例，我們更可以股鑑一下不遠年代的太平天國，所謂「叛亂的長毛」，就已可見微知着了。</p>
<p>戰爭能殺人是不錯的，但是善用之，却也未嘗不可以活人。譬如「一路哭不如一家哭」之類的這種戰爭，不僅是必要，而且一定是死戮者少，獲活者多，這是値得採取的。反之，和平能活人也是不錯的，但若錯了方向，和平一樣還是會殺人。譬喻擁護着「一家哭何如一路哭」的和平，那是非常要不得的；那樣和平下去，也必然是活者極少而死者轉多。這種和平不但是眞要詛咒，而且必須排斥。</p>
<p>這裏，因之就需要有一種認識：盲目的非戰與盲目的作戰，都是不足爲訓的。戰爭之來，應該是辨認的勇氣要先於悸怕：問這是爲什麼來的戰爭？爲別人抑爲自己？辨認旣淸，而後纔敢倡言和平，纔不致盲目上當，仰天受戮。</p>
<p>所以講到非戰，如果利害眞牽涉到了弱者自己，却不是祈禱和平可了，也祗惟有以戰止戰，死裏求生。否則也祇好「優勝劣敗，天然淘汰」，仰天受戮了。</p>

<p>— 趙琦</p>
<p>（上）</p>
<p>我們共約二十餘人的一個團體，在八點一刻乘了市電到新宿驛，再買一元二十錢吉野觀梅往返券，隨着蜂羣的遊客，擠進了車廂。一時空氣很沉悶，坐定了意外的接着一陣綿綿地細雨，車上人都「駄目駄目」（糟糕的意思）地嘮叨，在我却感到雨中探梅，獨有她地妙境哩。然而不一會，重濕的雨氣仍舊化成一塊塊乾凈的晴雲。</p>
<p>吉野梅林是東京近郊唯一的名勝，例年逢花盛期特放專車遊覽，遊客自二月中旬直到三月下旬絡續不斷。日本人對於遊春地興致很濃厚並且很高雅，猶其是女人，她們覺得在這時身邊缺少一件美麗的花傘和眺望鏡是足以憾愧的事，普通人都集合家族携着野餐的東西，年老的學者們，往往隨身帶着筆床硯匣和酒瓶，尋搜詩料去。</p>
<p>省綫車一個站口也不攏，只是把我們往早春地色調裏拖進，越過了背面塗着殘雪的立川山，第一眼見到的便是故鄉多年夢想的冰梅。這時心上愉快地輪廓正像他們剛纔看到晴雨那樣的面孔。疑視一向，先是一株兩株的掠過，隨後漸漸稠密起來，分排在雅緻地矮屋的兩旁，朝着日光鍍上一層炫眼的薄銀，窗口兜進來一陣溫軟的風，人們都浴在冷香裏，隔座戴着紅呢帽的老者在被人圍住勸酒，小孩不時嗅着鼻洞發響。</p>
<p>從這裏過去便是靑梅驛，下車步行可以直到梅林了，不過在車券上說明有三處可以下車往那裏去，就是這前面還有日向和田和樂樂園兩站哩。我們爲使幽美的地方不致遺漏，終於在末尾的一站下車，車上的人恰也以這裏下來的最多呢。（未完）</p>

<p>夜。</p>
<p>灰黑的帳幔能罩了月色星光，在雲翳裏透露出來的稀微光閃之下，大地只是一片黯澹，矇矓氣象。各鄉民在廚下草草地吃了他們的晚餐後，卽忽怱拐出大門外，凑和着隣舍兄弟們悠閑的說地談天，並且希冀投身於遼闊的自然界懷抱裏療養倦累的身體。於是草坡上，地坪上擺着三三兩兩的椅子櫈子，堆聚着人羣。輕微的幽靈喘息似的夜風，一陣陣低微地吹拂人們底枯燥，憔悴而呈現疲勞徵象的面容</p>
<p>「噢……噢……」</p>
<p>在人們的談話聲中，偶爾也會發出一兩句悲戚的深沉太息聲。那音調的悒鬱，悽愴，猶如飽經工作疲役的磨坊老驢，臨當休息時呆呆的靜臥着之際的低微喘息一樣。</p>
<p>但是，自然界畢竟是仁厚，慈善，而且博愛人羣：人們經過一陣安靜的休息，人們又像地球從黑夜輾轉到天明，彷彿又從新由造物賦與了生命，而顯示着活潑歡欣的氣象。人們暫時遺忘了疲乏，興高采烈的談笑了，老頭子憶起從前的太平盛世景况，諄諄而津津有味的向後輩叙說：從前如何的容易做人，兩文錢可以買一匣火柴，三十個錢可以買一斤猪肉，幾十個錢可以上酒館坐他半天……而今呢，世界變了！猪肉要幾毛錢一斤，火柴要買到十幾文一匣，欲上酒館就非幾毛錢不能稍稍吃喝，……最後自然是把頭一搖，慨然的歎息道：「一代不如一代了，做人眞不容易呀……」</p>
<p>「米又漲價啦！」</p>
<p>在一個角落裏忽的有人如此驚呌。衆人聽後像着了迅雷之襲擊一般，立卽抖慄，歎息個不休。自然啦，他們得此突如其來的消息所威脅，而爲渺茫的生活前途憂慮，悲愁了。</p>
<p>「怎麼好呢？」他們太息，太息，深深的歎息，悲悽而愴啞。</p>
<p>雰圍裏又復歸於寂靜。人們默默無言而憂戚地坐着，像一羣休息室中的倦牛，在無涯的黑暗裏喘息，唏噓。這就是他們生命的象徵呀。</p>

<p>到了晚上，我一定要誦讀兩三回給人家聽。第二次的剩飯擔來了，附近的人們和賣刷把的阿吉哥，買灰的阿重哥，一隻手的阿熊哥等等，有的把飯拿回去了再到回來；有的就排坐在門框上，將飯和湯一塊兒裝在預先寄存在那裏的，油漆脫落了的木碗裏，一壁吃，一壁熱心地聽我誦讀演義。—這，巳經變成了他們的習慣。</p>
<p>做了四年級生的時候，我已經是個學校裏頭的演義通。記得曾有過一回這樣的事情。在我們班級裏很有勢力的。叫做近松的男學生，畫了一幅加藤淸正跟木山彈正相格鬥，而從山崖上掉下來的塲面的繪畫，向大家誇示着。但是，五年級生的級長名叫米村的，却說起話來了：那幷不是木山彈正，而是四王天但馬守。究竟是木山彈正還是四王天但馬守呢，都不能够下判斷，於是，約略三十人左右的近松一級和約略二十五六人左右的米村一級就對抗起來，一邊主張是木山，一邊主張是四王天，各執己見，險些兒臘成了一塲惡鬥。因此，同學中的靈敏的傢伙，就課也不上，特別跑到我家裏來接我，說是要我去裁判。於是，我就照常背着弟弟，跑到大家都在的地方，說明「是木山彈正」；幷且，還加以解釋：木山原比淸正要來得强，淸芷最先是給按倒在地上的：但從崖上掉下來時，他的頭盔給蔓兒纏繞着，他就乘機翻了一個身，才把對方殺死了的。這麽着，我們一級就算勝利了，大家都擁護着我，怪高與的；但在歸途中，當我只有一個人的時候，就給米村一派的學生們包圍着，把我打得落花流水。</p>
<p>那一隻手的阿熊哥，下身圍着紅布的阿豐哥，賣刷把的阿吉哥，買灰的阿重哥等等都住在我的家裏。</p>
<p>這些都是在我的生歷中忘記不了的人們。當我年歲越長，對於事物越能够淸晰地加以判斷的時候，就越發不能不想起這些人。</p>

<p>— 王雨桐</p>
<p>各國之經濟界自深受不景氣之襲擊以來，無不各謀救濟及恢復之道，一方努力覓取向外發展之途徑，俾失之於此者，得取償於他人：或圖早脫身於不景氣之雰圍氣圈外；究其極，要皆不出於以鄰爲壑損人利己之經濟政策耳。中國不幸，處此不景氣之潮流中，就經濟方面言，自身旣乏保障能力，於是環而伺之者，各國視綫羣集於我矣。在過去數年中，我國方喘息於災祲迭乘，農村破產，都市工商凋落等惡劣經濟情况之下，外復受各國之經濟剝削，如外貨之賤價傾銷也，在華外商工廠之壓迫華廠，最近如幾成事實之申新七廠之被無理拍賣也，我民族工業之受人摧殘者，於今益甚。</p>
<p>金融資本，爲維持民族生存之物資上最大源泉。歷來各國除對於中國民族工業之侵凌外，而於中國之金融資本，復作强有力之征服，巳彰彰在人耳目。試觀外商銀行在華之活動情狀，巳足證明。據統計報吿，上海開設之外商銀行共二十五家；其勢力之雄厚，遠駕華商銀行而過之。近自美國宣佈白銀政策以後，積極吸收中國現銀，於是外商銀行紛紛將其庫存現銀，移往海外，使中國金融市塲頓因通貨緊縮，牽動信用恐慌，而致金融風潮，亦隨之而起。處此種情形之下，中國自身因經濟衰頽，工商業不振，無法藉國際貿易之調劑，以挽回非常之局面。其勢必除由華商銀行向海外收購現銀，重返上海，如最近之金融委員會向倫敦定購銀條，運回以充實庫存外，實無他法。而在華之外商銀行，遂擬乘機作進一步之吸收白銀計劃：（一）各行對於原定存戶之利息，提高其利率，此與歷來外商銀行之以低利吸收存欵政策適相反。曩時外商銀行之存息，大率祇一二釐之譜。在江浙戰事發生時，一般無知之殷商富戶，紛將現欵改存各外商銀行，其時各行反因存欵過多，藉以要索保管費，歷年各外商銀行之藉此種反常現象，而牟獲巨利者，實難數計。但自近年海外銀價高漲後，各外商銀行為謀利用中國之現銀，運赴國外，獲更巨之利益計，乃不得不出於吸收存欵之一途。然以時期之推移，我國之經濟情况，曁人民之經濟智識，容或稍有異於往昔。於是以提高利率之美餌，爲誘引之工具。（二）若僅以提高利率爲餌，猶不足以吸收大量之現銀。於是必賴恢復發鈔，始足與之相輔而行。最近上海各外商銀滙豐·麥加利·橫濱·正金·等銀行，以滙豐當局之首先實行，已議决致恢復發鈔政策。據最近統計，滙豐家所發行之新鈔，巳達千萬元以上；其他如花旗等銀行，亦在趕製新鈔，準備發行，按銀行之發鈔，自以準備金之充實，為第一要義。過去各發鈔外商銀行，其發鈔之所以博得一般人之信仰者，其最大原因，則爲其準備基金充實耳。試以二十三年一月份之統計而言，匯豐銀行庫存現銀有八千三百九十二萬一千元，麥加利銀行存銀七千二百四十六萬九千元，正金銀行存銀二千零二十萬九千元，台灣銀行存銀七百五十三萬六千元，花旗銀行存銀二千五百五十五萬一千元，其鈔票之發行，據估計尙不及存銀百分之二。但今歲之情形則逈異，據一月份之統計，滙豐庫存現銀減為三百七十二萬三千元，麥加利存銀减爲一百九十萬元，正金存銀减爲三百三十九萬元，台灣存銀减爲三百六十八萬八千元，花旗存銀减爲八百萬零六千元，持與去年同期相較，則滙豐一家即减少有八千零十九萬八千元，是此項庫存顯現鉅額之减少，必爲從事大量之輸出所致，可無疑義。然銀行準備基金日少，籌碼不足，一旦苟遇意外發生，勢將影響及於銀行本之信用，故外商銀行爲防萬一計，亟圖恢復鈔，以誘致鉅額現銀，旣可備充準備之用，復可再謀輸出，一石兩鳥，其計固莫善於此矣。</p>
<p>顧今日者我金融業已處此空前未有之嚴重時期，對於外商銀行之經濟侵略，非羣起合力，妥愼應付，則禍患所及，不特將使我金融界年來艱苦造成之幣制信用，及良好現象，爲之摧毀殆盡；且將任令外銀行恢復其昔年壓倒華商銀行之勢力，與外幣在市塲上所得之優勢，危險更甚。故爲今後計，不侫以爲（一）應首先採用昔年日本金融恐慌時期所收之銀行合併政策，凡資力薄弱，根基未固之小銀行，應各就其性質相同者，互相合併改組，以期資力集中，目標統一，俾謀信用制度之鞏固。（二）各銀行亟宜負起提倡國貨扶助工商之責任，一般民衆，應在銀行家領導之下，絕對信仰本國銀行，以維護本國銀行鈔票之信譽。（三）諱疾忌醫，為人之大戒。昔年我國金融業，其病端在於自固吾圉，諺所謂「自掃門前雪，莫管他人瓦上霜」。故每易為外邪所乘，而自毀藩籬年來吾業人已深自覺於過往之非，羣謀矯正，此後倘更能從健全組織，整齊步驟上着眼，則應付之方，其在斯賦！廿四年三月十六日於北平</p>

<p>在不久以前，吳興的錢莊，因為拖欠蘇州錢莊往來欵項，一時無力清償，而為蘇同行聯名登報絕交的一幕從來僅見的悲劇，想來大家還能知道。這不是錢莊業衰敗的開始嗎？本來中國的錢莊業，因為有悠遠的歷史，在社會上遂也有相當的聲望和地位，並目滿佈着深刻的印象。牠的使命，既在調節各業金融之盈虛，因此對於社會各方面，自生產以至消費者，也就無不息息相關。所以錢莊業的盛衰，須視整個社會經濟之興替而轉移；決非一己所能振作，或一時所可擴展。吳興誰也知道是中國蠶絲區域的中心，那末近年來，華絲因列強經濟侵奪的結果而一落千丈，凡是風行蠶桑的地方，當然最先蒙受重大的損害。吳興的錢莊，身處其間，經不起蘇同行的當頭一棒，在薄弱的能力下，更免不了捉襟見肘的窘態，對外的信用，那得不宣吿破產？於是倒的倒，停的停，一十四家同行，在四面楚歌中掙扎，能繼續維持營業的，最後僅剩一家。這般說也凄慘的情况，雖然不是偶然的一面事，但因此造成嚴重的局勢，却亦誰也不敢否認。所以接踵而報驚的：如嘉興十二家錢莊，除絡繹收歇外，去秋日間又倒閉三家，以致連累其他各家相繼停業。海鹽四家錢莊，一年中完全擱淺。常州二十餘家錢莊，祇剩一家支撑殘局。無錫十八家中剩九家，鎭江三十餘家留五家，平湖十七家中剩八家，嘉善六家留二家。餘如崇德·硤石·杭州·長興·紹興·靑浦·蘇州·丹陽等處錢莊，這幾年中，幾無一處沒有不减少。且不獨絲繭區域如此，他若通州·揚州·蚌埠·以至扼華中商業重心的漢口錢莊，也遭受同一的侖運，有收帳的，有淸理的，紛紛落下台去。而安慶的錢莊，竟全體掃數停閉。開封因信昌銀號的停業，致同業同時受軋，釀成金融風潮。且信昌分號，遍設山東·江蘇·湖北·河南·陝西·河北·山西七省，所以影響尤大。濟南自義聚盛銀號倒閉後，成德厚繼之閉歇，風聲所播，全市震動。徐州也因公裕銀號的擱淺，以致私家票號的紙幣，突然擠兌，演成金融界之軒然大波。廣州亦以銀號之倒閉，接續不斷，致人心浮動，紙幣狂落。而汕頭的景象，更見危殆，雖由市商會等竭力設法維持，乃市面的安定，非盃水與薪所可濟事，因之銀號信用，益形墜落。號稱中堅份子的陳源大等三家，因惡浪所捲而停業後；繼以光發等三家，又來一個蕭規曹隨。何如金融恐慌的情勢，復愈演愈烈，最後嘉發以及廣興昌等數家，也在這一幕中宣吿閉幕。像這樣步趨恐後情形，眞可說是風吹草動一般！最近福州·天津·唐山·北平·以及票號策源地的太原等處，又有多家銀號站不住足，先後宣吿停業。而房地產狂跌聲中的厦門，復於一週間連倒素稱資本雄厚的三大錢莊，致金融界頓覺風雨飄搖。即號爲全國首善之區的上海，任你去金相玉式，粉飾得怎樣太平，可是在這到處危機交迫的當兒，上海雖然繁華，究竟不能和田園詩人陶靖節先生理想中的「黃髮垂髫怡然自樂」的別一洞天並論。所以上海的錢莊，也不能避免刧運的光臨，民十七那一年，南北市滙劃莊，計達八十七家，可說氣象萬千，為民元以來最蓬勃的一年。或者盛極必衰的一句話，恰巧在這個時候使牠的權威，所以民十七後的上海錢莊，有似寒暑表沒有能力去抵抗冷的壓迫而逐度降縮了：民十八祇八十四家，民十九祇七十八家，民二十一祇七十二家，民二十二祇有六十八家了。不道在去年將告結束的歲底，不幸得很，金融　風潮，突然擴大，寳大裕等四莊，因此犧牲了；隨後復宣佈淸理的，又有四家，所以今春上市的滙劃莊，祇剩五十七家，和民十七相較，巳减少了三分之一强。這樣說來，今日的錢莊業，東也動搖，西也凋零，衰敗的景象，有同一幅百孔千瘡的畫圖，像這般慘不忍睹的畫圖，當然不是唐寅的「虎」，或趙子勗的「馬一，足供有閒階級的消遣。我們應該看出這幅畫圖的背後，有極生動的渲染：什麽農村破產？工商業奄奄待斃？失業恐慌嚴重？和資金集中？以至物價暴落？地產呆木等？可驚可愕可悲可泣斑斑的創痕，凡是有心人見之，想來誰也要同聲嘆惜！</p>
<p>二</p>
<p>一國有一國的金融中心，一地也有一地的金融中心，在過去甚至現在，錢莊業不是把握着中國各地的金融中心嗎？所以各地錢莊的設立，非常普遍；也許因爲社會上萬分需要這種金融組織。况且錢莊業的立塲，在不變的定律下，始終保恃着某一時代遺傳下來的所謂以義爲利等良心上的機構，所以不論對人，不論對己，都以信用相表率，這是中國錢莊業的特質，也正迎合着國人的心理。尤其是「人人要面樹樹要皮」傳統思想下的體面商人，對於維護自己的資望，因爲有關營業得失，决不敢稍容輕視，也絕不願他人輕視，在在以信用爲前提。錢莊業能具備這樣條件，所以過去能獲得健全發展的機會。</p>
<p>現在嗎？錢莊業的衰敗，巳是無從掩飾的事實，過去的光榮，祇不過是歷史上的陳迹罷了！因此衰敗的原因，不是值得去細心得會嗎？以往錢莊業的發榮滋長，牠立足的基礎，既是建築在「民無信不立」的信字上，那末遭幾年來，全國一般信用的收綰，不是逼迫錢莊業走上未途的致命傷嗎？（未完）</p>

<p>— 秦鶴齡</p>
<p>吾國工商各業，以受九一八之事變打擊，幾致一蹶不振：內國債券，所受影響，亦至深切，各債價格暴跌數十元。迨廿一年，又以一二八滬案發生，局勢嚴重，停市至三月之久。債市驊失流通，金融亦歸呆滯，基本有動搖之虞。持票人與財政當局，協議整理內債，提出减輕利率，延長還期之辦法，證劵市塲，遂於五月份起重行開拍。初時價格低廉，但以合息仍能月得二分左右，有資者乘低價收進，債市遂扶遙直上。終以時局阢隉，對日問題，未有相當之解决，國際間陰霾重重，投資者裹足不前，投機者亦具戒心，市氣銷沉，交易清減。計全年交易僅九〇一，七一〇，〇〇〇元，比較二十年三，三四一，〇〇〇，〇〇〇元，减少二，四三九，二九〇，〇〇〇；換言之，不及二十年份三分之一。市價上落，亦較和緩，計最高最低平均折扣之差額，爲二三·二一七折，較之廿年份之平均差額四二·九四，僅及一半。迨廿二年邊警頻傳，榆關失守，熱河淪亡，赤燄猶熾；然債市反欣欣向榮，蒸蒸日上，良以近年來農村崩潰，內地破產，各地現欵，集中屯積於上海，一時都市游資充斥，投資無門，咸以債券爲尾閭，籌碼乃感缺乏，市價因以進步。旋至塘沽協定簽字，對日已吿一段落。加以宋前財長在美棉麥借欵吿成，人心大振，債價飛漲。自此堅定者數月。至十一月宋氏辭職交替，十二月閩省叛變，風波頓起，債市轉弱。幸以閩變短期戡定，人心良好，跌風如曇花一現，未久即告恢復。是年交易，頗見暢旺。全年計票面三，二一九，九五五，〇〇〇元，較廿一年份增二，三一八，二四五，〇〇〇。平均價格折扣亦較廿一年份增九·一三折。廿三年一月份起至八月份止，債市始終在多頭控制之下，飛黃騰達，盛極一時。新高價層出不窮，幾無月不見。其中雖以藏本事件，曾引起一度跌風，旋經安全尋獲後，即行回漲；至八月份巳登峯造極。各債折扣，全在七五折以上，九關九善幾至八五折，利率僅合得月息七厘左右。因此引起有實貨者之拋售；加以美國提高銀價，白銀外流，洋拆步漲，銀根見緊，債市遂逐步趨疲，跌勢未戢者數月。道十二月，洋拆猛漲，銀根奇緊，爲近年來所罕有，銀行界催贖押欵，拒做套利交易，使多頭向資挹注之路絕，乃生恐慌，紛紛拋售，籌碼擁擠，本下月份價格倒褂，多頭窘態，可見一斑，市况黯淡，疲莫興。能惟全年平均折扣，較廿二年尚好一二·六五六折，交易亦至暢旺。茲將三年來平均折扣比較表，最高最低折扣比較表，成六交割數目比例諸表列後：</p>

<p>就上表觀察，可注意者有下列數端，</p>
<p>（一）三年來債券價格，步步見悄。二十二年較二十一年高九，一三折。而二十三年較二十二年又高一二，又五折，較二十一年竟高二一，七八六折。其中價漲最多者爲一八關稅，計漲廿四，四零五折，最少者爲一九關稅，亦有一八，八八五折之多。（觀第一表）</p>
<p>（二）年來折扣最高者，皆爲一八關稅，二十一年爲六九，五八折，二十二年爲八一，一五折，二十三年為八九，二五折，（觀第二表）因該債券償清期限較近，籌碼較少故也。</p>
<p>（三）三年來折扣最低者，皆爲整六公債。二　十一年計二六折，二十二年爲三四，二零折，二十三年爲四五，七零折，（觀第二表）因該債祗付利息，抽籤還本，須待至民國二十五年也</p>
<p>（四）二十一年差額最大者爲一八關稅，計二五，一八折。二十二年爲一九關稅，計二九，六四折。二十三年爲裁兵公債，計三零，零五折。（觀第二表）</p>
<p>（五）二十一年差額最小者爲整六公債，計二零，六零折。二十二年爲裁兵公債，計二五，四五折。二十三年爲二十三年關稅，僅八，五八折。（觀第二表）</p>
<p>（六）三年中債市上落最大者爲二十二年份，計二七，一二九折，二十三年次之，二十一年最小。（觀第二表）</p>
<p>（七）成交數價，以二十三年爲最多，計較廿二年份多一，二五一，六四零，零零零元，較二十一年份寬多至三，八六九，八八五，零零零元。二十一年二十二年兩年成交總數，尙不能紙二十三年一年之咸交數，市况之盛，可見一斑。（讓第三表）</p>
<p>（八）交割數目，並不隨成交數目遞增，其比例反逐年减低，此足以證明投機盛而投資少，外表雖似堅挺，而底裏實屬弱。（觀第五表）</p>
<p>債市高漲，與其謂金融界之繁榮，無寗謂爲吾國經濟不健全之反映，市况蓬勃，乃陽光返照一種畸形狀態而已。蓋內地現欵，旣集中上海，而投資途徑，又異常狹窄，於是羣趨於債券之買賣。迨乎現銀出口，銀根驟緊，乃又出售實貨，故債券之能否繁榮，全視整個地經濟爲轉移。三年來內價之漲跌受政治之威脅少，受經濟之支配多。當熱河失守，華北陷於嚴重狀態之時，而債券反蒸蒸日上。迫二十三年終，對外關係，日趨融洽，勦匪旣吿成功，中央與西南意見，亦漸接近；環境良好，人心穩定，而債市反奄奄無生氣，疲莫能無，無它次正爲經濟支配之故也。</p>

<h3 id="c218">再談孔子重遊新大陸 <a href="#c218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— 冬烘</p>
<p>前日本刋上發表過「春雨」先生的大作「孔子重遊新大陸」一文，讀之頗爲有趣，但題目是「孔子重遊新大陸」，而文中的語氣，却並「不是重遊新大陸」，太有文不對題之嫌，故我亦來借先生的題材，發揮我的鄙見，或亦爲春雨先生所許也。</p>
<p>孔子本來是喜歡遊歷出名的，無論什麽人請他去，他老人家總是欣然願往，絕不拒却，卽如亂臣賊子公山不狃，使人召孔子，孔子尙且欲往，後被子路打擋，卒不果行，還有一個叛臣佛胖，亦曾經使人召過孔子，孔子亦想去，又被子路打擋，孔子雖發了一番牢騷，到底亦未曾去，並且孔子所到的國，只有在幾位熟識的朋友處打打尖，衛國的遽伯玉家，齊國的司城貞子家，原是他的老主顧，從來沒有人特地建築起「孔公館」來請他去住過，所以此次日本請他前去，孔子亦未必表示反對。</p>
<p>並且孔子對於女界，也常常胡調得落，衛靈公夫人有南子者，使人表示欲見孔子的意思，孔子見之，夫人在帷中，孔子在帷外，隔帷相見，孔子入門北面稽首，夫人自帷中再拜，環聲玉聲璆然，南子原是衛國頂頂有名的一位交際花，因此以憨大出名的子路，聽見這事，大爲不悅，孔子急忙鄭重聲明道，你不要誤會，假定我有不規則的念頭者，天必棄我，我可在你面前賭個咒，前次國聯調查團到日，日本曾經開過一個盛大的跳舞會，一時粉白黛綠，鬢影釵光，賓主都盡歡而散，假定此次孔子赴日，日本亦必格外優待，開會歡迎，我想孔子這時，也必手之舞之足之蹈之，像聞韶一樣，要三月不知肉味呢。</p>
<p>孔子是一位識寳太師，亦是一位考古家，所以對於古董藝術方面，很有研究，故孔子嘗問禮於老朋，學琴於師襄，所以他很喜歡到各國去遊歷，增進他的學識，因此路上象唐僧到西方佛國去取經一樣，遭了許多魔難，斥乎齊，逐乎宋衛，困於陳蔡之間，但是孔子依舊要去遊歷，將西見趙簡子，至阿聞竇鳴犢舜華之死，臨河而歟曰，美哉水，洋洋乎，丘之不濟此，命也夫。因爲這次沒有達到赴晋的目的，他非常懊喪，所以孔子到各國去遊歷是他生平所最喜歡，的一件事，但是孔子所到之處，未必盡受人家歡迎，還要被人家驅逐，現在孔子死了已久，祗有一個木主，無論到那裏去，有什麼關係呢？所以無論何人要請他去，孔子决不會反對，亦决不發生任何關係，並且他自己說，丘也東西南北之人也，所以他跑了生世把腿，吃了許多苦頭，並不懊悔，現在坐了飛機火車輪船，到各國去遊歷，眞是得其所哉了。</p>
<h3 id="c219">礜石山的春天 <a href="#c219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— 春暉</p>
<p>是春天了，礜石山上便騰起了生命的歡笑。大海從媽嶼口轉了個灣，把汕頭半島環繞着：礜石山從都市的對面峙立起來，向着都市和大海騰起了春天的歡笑。</p>
<p>海灣里輪船和大小船見密密地擁擠着。春天的海只泛起了微波。太陽明亮地照在水面，帆影被拖起了大幅的黑色的尾巴。太陽的黃金色，在藍色的海水</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>上反射，把那返影映在礜石山的山坡。</p>
<p>有許多木船，每天渡過了小小的海程，載着客人往來於汕頭和礜石山之間。輪船激起了波瀾，木船便搖擺起來，發出了欵乃之聲。</p>
<p>從譽石山的頂峯，大海的景色全被收在眼底。汕頭市的密叢叢的屋宇，和海關前成排的巨厦，全都顯露出來。都市的上層被烟霧所瀰漫，而市聲的喧鬧隔海可聞。海口的砲畫却露着醜怪而黯黑的面貌，在春天里那醜惡的面相異常怕人。一和綠山的溫和的面相相陪襯，更顯出非常地不調和。</p>
<p>山上嫩草靑靑，鋪滿山徑。西人墓園的紅棺，在春天里更射出銅色的色澤。墓塲整潔而多野花，長眠人安眠地下。洋式小屋子點綴在山間，窗口張向着海。也有小小的茅屋，春天的暖意遮去了牠的形容的拙陋。</p>
<p>山腰的學校，宿舍和敎室常散播出笑聲。運動塲上球聲喧噪，靑年小夥子發揮了靑春的活躍。</p>
<p>早晨，和黃昏，洋人常常帶着纎腰的女人，躑躅在山徑。炎陽的午後，也每每有渡海行來的遊人，整潔的洋裝常常配合着絲旗袍子。在極早的早晨，學生子則以輕捷的身軀，在山間亂竄。</p>
<p>一有小國兵艦椗泊在海中，兩三個兩三個一羣的水兵便着上水兵服，在山間穿鑽。偶然也有些漁人們，却用着剛强的步伐。在山中踏上沈重的步子。</p>
<p>領事官們踏着外國紳土的矯揉的步態，而年少的女學生們，却在樸素的上衣下繫着褶裙，步履是自然而活潑的輕盈。</p>
<p>從譽石山望向後面，廣大的平原却顯出綠色的田疇。許多小村落疏落地間雜在田疇中間，小屋子一堆堆聚集在一起。樹叢包圍着村落，和一碧無垠的田疇做個分朋的界綫。</p>
<p>江河在礜石山的兩面平流，從山上看來，那紅色的水色便像一條赤色的布帶。媽嶼口束緊牠的狹隘的小口，一色海水像是一口大池。潮水漲落時候，那洶湧的海潮雄壯得有如兵士打衝鋒。</p>
<p>月夜在春天的礜石山更是異常柔和和優美。都市的喧囂被隔着一重薄海，在這里便沈靜得有如大自然在打瞌睡。月光灑滿光輝在山間，詩情流露在每一塊石頭和每一片泥土上面。礜石山的居民睡在月夜里面，做個甜夢是比別的地方來得容易。</p>
<p>在春天，山笑着，海也笑着；紅花含羞，綠草嬌憨；……人從冬天的寒凍間醒轉過來，也向海，山，花和草笑着</p>
<p>整個礜石山的春天都充滿着歡笑呢！</p>
<h3 id="c220">春野風景綫 <a href="#c220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— 秦鑒</p>
<p>（和暖的三月的太陽，從日歷的頁到頁之間，緩緩地，像神之奇跡那麽地飄下來了，人從昏睡或靡爛的慾流中像也有了一次小了的醒覺：我們是記憶着的：是春天了啊。）</p>
<p>是春天了，不景氣的人世間是永遠在狂放中貪戀着下一個新的刺激的：因此，當紅的。紅與歡笑已經在厭膩中頭掉了她們的刺激性的時候，大家便發狂地喊起來了：是春天了啊，我們到田野去，到田野去！</p>
<p>（—到野外去，到野外看春天去啊</p>
<p>—不是嗎？都會是該死的，都裏是沒有春天，也沒有秋天的啊——蠢牛</p>
<p>—Daddy，親愛的，我眞高興，我在這靑靑的生命中還沒有看見過鄉下人底樸實的笑呢。我想這一定是很可愛的——我從哈代的鄕土小說上面看到過那些詩一般的描寫的。</p>
<p>—是的，親愛的。</p>
<p>跟着紳士們嘴邊的雪茄烟的飄遊，特快車鉗扼着鐵軌向前奔：紅的花與靑綠的野草，已經是春天的郊野了呢！）</p>
<p>難道說，在大都會也呈現了飄搖的年頭，田野裏是眞像詩一艘的美麗的嗎</p>
<p>人，跟着氣侯的暖，漸漸地多起來了；一簇地分散在四處，聽了野百靈的狡滑的舌頭，聽了小溪的流動，聽了黃昏中的一點鐘聲，而最後，却也聽了充塞在田野間的沈鬱的嘆息。</p>
<p>小市鎭上從開了春起，連雜糧誧都挨家地關起了，平常在街上耀武揚威的，氅着衣襟的，撩撥女人的土棍都流到更不成樣的地步了，因爲茶館已經關起，賭攤是早就空了——人家全成了個空殼子啦，還賭什麼？</p>
<p>而，另一方面，跟着鄉鎭的衰落，在田野裏的人也同樣地把亂世的抑鬱吐在空野裏：恐慌，飢餓；還有編織在時代之交替中的，老年人的嘆息，和少年人的憤恨。</p>
<p>缺少了充飢東西是頂可怕的。上一個年頭是旱荒，這一個春天還快活什麽。家裏是：年靑的夥子全不知下落地飄出去了。淸朋左右，四處的墳塲上還是冷淸淸的，不看見紙灰的飄，也聽不到動人的年輕孀婦的哭聲了。這年頭，死的比活的幸福得多呢。還有：連人都顧不了，還顧得到什麽死鬼，喝！</p>
<p>一種沈鬱的調子橫過四野；大自然是鐵一般地守着時序之紀律的：春天了，照常把花的蓓蕾與細小的草葉子張掛起來：可是在人們都愁着下一次的餐食的時候，還有誰來神往那些不値錢的花兒草兒呢？</p>
<p>但是，終於有一些從一個古怪的地方——從都會裏來的人們，在笑臉與金絲的眼鏡中，把那些被另一些所冷漠的花草欣賞過了。春天是自然之母的黃金時代，春天是住在郊外的啊！</p>
<p>（紅的蝴蝶，黃的蝴蝶，像落花一般的飛去了，田野裏盤旋的着是一種不可抹去的褐色的沈鬱，像大雷雨前的烏雲那樣地，多呌人窒息啊。）</p>
<p>三天了，一個星期了，春游專車的頭等廂裏有人在想：</p>
<p>「田野裏的春天，可並沒有詩人所描寫的那麽可愛啊。」</p>
<h3 id="c221">十剎海 <a href="#c221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>我曾在這帶有濃郁的泥士味的海邊，消耗了我一大串的日子，我的每一個淸爽的早晨的灰淡的黃昏，我都統統埋葬在牠的懷里。關於牠的眞面目是怎樣的，我是很淸楚的。</p>
<p>在那兒無，論是那一個淸爽的日子，老少不了在柳叢上跳躍歌唱的小鳥的在天空上兜着圈子，時發出哇哇……的哨子聲的白鴿；提着鳴籠，在柳蔭下來回地踱着方步的老頭，負簍提網，在海邊的小河中網魚的壯漢，載笠荷鋤，在田疇中辛勤地勞作的農夫農婦，……置身在這里的人，每會忘記了自己是活在一二百萬人口的大都市里的。一到暮靄漸漸地垂下來時，倦遊歸來的烏鴉，就盡）在那帶着紅霞的天空中，盤桓高噪，一隊隊灰白色的鴨子，也振振翼膀，跳進淸澈的水中，漫無目的地到處游蕩着。血紅的夕陽，斜掛在山巒似的城頭上，遠遠近近的垂柳，都籠罩着一層輕薄的烟霧；透過輕霧向東面看過去，矗立在那里的，是一座巍峨的，抹上一層淡色的夕照的古鼓樓和鐘。這時，在眼前展開的，不恰是一幅絕妙的天然團畫嗎？</p>
<p>是在嚴冷的冬天吧，在水面蕩漾着的靑蓮，經不起刺骨的寒風的吹拂，早已枯萎沈沒了。這時平鋪在海中的，是一片皎潔的，堅厚的冰床。泳床上面，是成爲一班窮苦人家的唯一娛樂塲所：孩子們，用他們自製的冰履，在這上面溜躂着；壯漢們，拉下他們的冰船來，（所謂冰船，原不過只是下面嵌着二條鐵條的大桌子而已。）在這上面來回裝運着客人。買不起一雙溜冰鞋的人家，如也欲賞賞冰上溜走的滋味時，花個四五枚銅元，來坐一回冰船，那也就算賞到了。一到了春天，冰床漸漸地溶化爲淸水了時，北方所特有的大風，就澈日澈夜地刮着，光禿的柳梗，時發出呼呼呼……的呌聲，海水就像汪洋似的，一個浪頭緊接着一個浪頭，向着彼岸滾過去。站在海邊的土堆上，舉頭看看海，看看柳枝，就會敎人不自覺地起了飄飄欲仙之感。春光老了時，柳葉就漸漸地在枝頭濃綠起來，海中的靑蓮，也就伸露出水面，隨風搖曳着了。一到烈日當空的炎夏來時，聽聽淸晰的鳥語，嗅嗅淸芬的荷香，所謂日暖魚跳波面靜，風輕鳥語樹蔭凉的淸景，這時是活現在眼前來了。及至夏去秋來時，濃綠的垂柳，是披上一層淡黃色的外衣來了，海中的荷花，早已凋謝了，盆似的葉子，也漸呈着枯萎之象來。如果是個兩天，一個人獨自張着傘在河堤上漫步，或走進海邊的茶樓，憑欄獨酌時，那留得殘荷聽雨聲的幽趣，這時是被賞到了。</p>
<p>像這樣一個帶有濃厚的鄕村味的處所，在我這過慣都市生活的鄕下人的腦子里，是永不會遺忘了的！</p>
<h3 id="c222">懷戀 <a href="#c222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— 央央</p>
<p>回憶像一重深沉的霧，寂寞里；我的腦袋又掉在沉思里了！</p>
<p>雖然都市的表面是繁華的，可是流浪人的心境像一塊冰；永遠沒有暖熱的時候。卽使有，這也屬於暫時的。</p>
<p>春光好像在幾陣浙瀝的兩聲里，更其絢爛了！美麗的季節，使每一顆的心兒更其沉在舊的甜蜜里。</p>
<p>初戀的滋味像蜜，在南華的蒼前山頭是我最可眷戀的一個地方了！一度的梅花萎謝，人們卸下了重裘；披上了輕便的春裝。</p>
<p>當夕陽映着梅花的頹技，蒼山的鐘聲；蕩揚着中世紀的幻想。每個人挾着皮裝書，從古舊的洋廈裏出來；躑躅在整齊的山路。</p>
<p>兩旁篩着榕樹蔭里陽光破碎的影子，踏上光復紀念碑；看一輪旭日在于山那一面漸漸地向西邊沉去。</p>
<p>到第二次的鐘聲，又從鐘樓里飄過來。這時一個上差的警備員，從鐵的軟梯裏爬上去。一個神色萎頓的，又接着下來了。</p>
<p>從石級的山路下去，在中間可以看到像一帶銀的鏈條的閩江。江南橋的激流里，白的浪花四濺着。走過江南橋一個環水的島里，這是我們的家了！</p>
<p>在這個島里，度過竟竟地幾年像水銀一樣流瀉着的歲月。看這個小島的興盛，這個小島也跟着連年的戰禍沒落了。閩江的嘴裏，帝國主義的淺水艦：也把竟個的繁華吞噬！</p>
<p>就在一個大動亂的時期，離開了這山谷水鄕；到現在尤似隔了一個悠長的世紀。</p>
<p>但是傳來的消息，這個島嶼更沉在不景氣的漩渦里。這堅固的化石，有一天會被大的浪頭激碎！</p>
<p>在我的心頭，又增加了無限惆悵。</p>

<h3 id="c226">最近四十張愛情片子名字的研究 <a href="#c226" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e226" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">226</a></h3>
<p>— 伯甯</p>
<p>每到星期六，從辦公室裏鬆了一口氣出來，第一句便要問人：「今天下午到那裏去看電影？」尤其是作者，更喜歡追問一句：「爲什麽要到那裏去？爲什麽要去看那張片子」？問了許多許多遍，問了無數無數人，他們的回答，歸納起來祗有三句話：「我知道那張片子好。」「那邊的地位相宜些。」「那片子似乎是怪好的。」</p>
<p>關於第一種，那是片子本身的價值高，同時也是影評的功勞。因為一般人看電影之先，先翻翻當天的影評，或問問看過的人，知道了片子的好壞纔去看的。第二種時影戲本身的事情，價目，設備，地位，相宜，自然引人些。祗有第三種人，他們全憑直覺。他們對於戲院沒有好惡，影評沒有翻過，也沒有人告訴他那張片子好。他們隨隨便便在報上，在馬路旁的廣告上，甚至走過影戲院門口，看到一張片子的名字，覺得很合胃口，就逕自進去了。這是誰的功勞？這是「片名」。一張片子的名字，正像一篇文章，一本書，他的名字有很大的價值，有很大的魔力，所以也最容易打動人。</p>
<p>爲了這個緣故，作者搜集了從二月份到目下的許多電影片名，加以分析研究。其中國產片子的名字，一般的說來，好的較多，有毛病的較少。這是因為本國出品不容易，提一個名字，當然鄭重，不敢輕率。至於外來的片子那就差遠了。所以本篇討論的僅以外來片子為對象，然而外來片中中如滑稽，戰爭，偵探，默片，雖然有些材料，究竟為數不多，不夠分析，所以又僅採取「愛情片子」的一部份。現在將研究的結果，約略敘述。</p>
<p>字和辭類重覆太多，此次所搜集的愛情片子總共四十部（片名從略），作者將其中單字加以分析，發現次數最多的字為：「情」竟有十三次。佔百分之三二·五；「春」有五次，佔百分之十二·五；「女」和「風」也各佔九次。再單獨辭類的分析，「春風」發現二次，「情史」也發現二次。如果更就相類似的辭類加以分析，那末已有了「春風」又有「春光」，「春色」，「春心」。已有了「情深」又有「多情」，「情奔」，「情侶」，「情種」，「懺情」……等。無論從心理學上講，或從廣告術上講，這樣的「疊床架屋」，實在是極大的毛病。譬如「談戀愛」吧，你對着你的情人，口裏老是說「我愛你，我愛你，我愛你，」毫沒有變換，對方會受你的感動吧？會來同情你嗎？</p>
<p>空泛的辭類太多……這四十張片子中間夾着一大堆的空泛的辭類，例如：「媚月」，「春風」，「憐香」，「竊玉」，「靈犀」……等，如呆在一塊牆上，並排排列着這些「憐香」，「竊玉」，「靈犀」等的字樣，叫你選取一種，你將何取何捨呢？那末要以這一大堆去吸引觀眾的如何成功？</p>
<p>字數太呆板……此次四十張片子中，有三十一張是四個字的名字。幾佔全數百分之八十。加入我們走進城隍廟，或關帝廟，抬頭細細地讀着排列着的四字匾額，我們有什麽感覺呢？我們不是祗覺得他們是「類類乎」，「差不多」，除了廟門，一些印象也沒有嗎？那末電影的觀眾對於這些排列整齊的影名，又有什麽感覺呢？</p>
<p>因為有了上面的三種缺點，我們對於外國片子，尤其是愛情片子，常常感得他們一樣的：「不着邊際」，一樣的「冷酷」，沒有熱烈的感情，沒有火一般的引誘力，引我們去欣賞，這是多不幸呢！</p>
<p>影片談評</p>
<h3 id="c227">評「美人玩物」 <a href="#c227" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e227" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">227</a></h3>
<p>— 華倫</p>
<p>“The　Gay　Bride”——南京映</p>
<p>私販惡霸之徒的出現與活躍於現社會中，比較過去的那一個時期多來得更厲害，由於這一現象上也反映着目前這社會內在的矛盾不安與潰腐的結癥。看吧，特別是所謂現代文明的大都會，或政治中心，商業中心的地方所流露在每天新聞紙上的這些私販惡霸中的大亨巨頭們的所作所為，什麽尋囂闖禍，明殺暗刺，以及復仇報怨等等。昨晚彼此爲了爭風吃醋，或斤頭講不好，曾大動干戈，今朝因有利可沾。有勢可借，便又若無其事的共謀合作了。表面上是結交權貴，參加善事，以取得政治社會的地位；暗地裏却是幹着種種作奸犯科的勾當。</p>
<p>還有一般寡廉喪恥，唯利是圖的婦女，今宵在情夫的懷中，明天就會向殺她情夫者手中接過重價的飾物來，後日又照例反復着這一套把戲。所以有人說，流氓與娼妓是資本主義社會的要素，特質。假如有人要周到地，深刻地來描寫這些流氓惡霸的生活的話，就可以寫成比左拉的叢著或托爾斯泰的「戰爭與和平」還偉大的著作的。</p>
<p>這一電影「美人玩物」，就是表現流氓生活的。自然，這僅以大西洋某域的幾個私販惡霸的瑣事作題材，而作者又不能盡情表現，所以成就却是有限的。</p>
<p>這兒從流氓蘇士與女戲子曼蘭的勾搭寫起。由兩人結婚那天的被敵黨尋仇與自己的心腹黨徒丁幹與米蓋的垂涎新娘，以及一個保鏢（小聽差）的拒敵與獻計上，介紹除了五六根人物綫來。寫出了男女間的互相欺詐，彼此仇殺，金錢肉體，以及金錢肉體這些糜爛腐化的生活。自然，這些關聯着現社會體制的現實，作者並未活生生地通過他那狹窄淺薄的認識點所攝取的一部分。僅是他們——流氓——相互間的一部分，這兒既忽略了他們在現社會中的對上之幫間作用，以及對下的壓榨任務。而且更粉飾着現實，使用着可笑的說教，譬如把那惡霸的忠實保鏢（小聽差）寫得那麼忠心耿跟，義俠可風，使人忘懷了他是保護誰的幫兇？而引起對流氓的好感。以及用那個女戲子，玩弄了多少流氓的女流氓的覺悟，把用肉體一再騙來的成萬家私，在街頭散發，作為救濟貧困的大慈善家等。至於如蘇士夫婦的蜜月旅行到歐洲時，各國多拒絕他倆入境，這也是騙人的謊話。實際上，如劇中人蘇士那樣的惡霸販販酒，玩玩女人，只要沒有犯上的野心，如劇中所表現的那樣，除了同輩中為着風頭，權勢與女人，有些爭奪之外，也沒有什麽罪大惡極的勾當，當局者也不至於就拒絕入境的吧。</p>
<p>導演傑克康衛（Jack　Conway）在這「美人玩物」中，倒有着可取的成績的，對於全劇關於流氓生活情調把握得真確，與五六條人物綫刻劃得清楚，特別是小聽差的個性，每個畫面中，每人的上下塲都由這空氣情調與人物性格，給予了動人的深切的感應力。比較起來，在幾個大塲面中的成果，只不及許多用小聰敏的小地方那麼大。本來是粗枝大葉，熱鬧而浮泛的劇本，倒收了纖巧細膩的效果了。</p>
<p>演員以演小聽差的吉士脫，馬力司，給予人的印象最深。</p>
<p>「獸異」扮演大自然女神的瓊派克—南京映</p>
<h3 id="c228">驚天動地的「獸異」 <a href="#c228" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e228" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">228</a></h3>
<p>— 雲水</p>
<p>米高梅公司費耗一年的光陰，從事於攝製這個號稱二十年來稀有的偉奇獸片。大導演范達克民稱該片為本年度最成功的，富於刺激性的獸劇，而美國名小說家湛恩葛萊（Zane　Grey）對之亦頌揚備至，推許為十年間獨步的作品。（按葛萊比係西部小說作風大師，不少他的著作曾經搬演銀幕而成功的，尤傑出者未Trader　Horn）。在明星單上，嬌媚活潑的十七齡女郎瓊派克領銜，而全劇主幹却是兩位獸明星，一位是一頭壯鹿，他是充飾那「獸異」中的瑪里布，另一位是一隻山獅Puma（美洲產獅種）他的名字叫甘陀。</p>
<p>顯然在森林中弱肉強食，自古認為天演鐵律。可是究竟萬物皆賦同情，而一切攫奪殘殺的行為，終歸於某種的衝動而已，大概空飛的禽，陸走的獸，水居的鱗，泥蟄的虫，始終跳不出「食」和「色」兩大圈子。所謂愛為命本，命依慾存，不論那類動物，平等地賦有牠生存的機能，例如爪牙螫毒，皮甲羽毛，是天生的保護的工具。那末這兒發生疑問，人類的智力——保護人種生存的工具——和同情，野獸們也賦有這種特殊機能嗎？或者他們僅僅為生存而殘殺，為殘殺而生存嗎？不錯，不日在南京公映的「獸異」中，可以給吾們一個極滿意的答復。</p>
<h3 id="c229">雜話「妻的情人」 <a href="#c229" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e229" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">229</a></h3>
<p>— 國城</p>
<p>雷電華的新片「妻的情人」（Haed　Coat　and　Glove）是表現浪漫和嫌疑兩重成分而發生的神秘暗殺事件的一段故事。</p>
<p>「妻的情人」的原名，直譯當譯作「帽子，衣服，和手套」，因此，我們當然可以知道這三個東西，在本片中是佔了怎樣一個重要的地位。如果要用最簡略的方法來說出這三件東西的關係，那是這樣的：當這個神秘謀殺的事情發生在一位少女身上的時候，人們在她的情人的房間裏尋到了她的屍體，而這時候，在那房間裏發現了一頂女人帽子和一件男人的外衣與一隻手套，同時這些東西就被當作案件的綫索引物。</p>
<p>至少，這是一部很悲慘動人的影片。全劇每一個畫面都充佈着緊張的空氣，演員Rich　do　Cordeg　Barbara　Robbins在本片中都很努力地盡着職。導演的手法也很輕鬆。本片在紐約上映的時候，曾得到「紐約每日新聞」和「紐約晚報」等十餘報紙的讀譽。</p>

<h3 id="c230">印度亡國恨（Glive　Of　India）（九） <a href="#c230" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e230" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">230</a></h3>
<p>— 懋德</p>
<p>克萊夫到了印度，將大勢加以一度的觀測，他覺得祗有利用密爾耶法一個方法，才可以使其國商人重樹穩固的基礎。薩爾烏特都拉是一個行為慘酷，人品卑污的人。甯蘭耶蘭比較的容易操縱些。他是薩爾烏特都拉的叔父，現在率領了薩爾烏特都拉的大軍。他雖然和英國處於對立的地位，但倘使能動之以利，使之倒戈內向，那英人就可以不戰而勝了。因此，克萊夫想和密爾耶法勾結起來，和他訂立密約，如果他能反戈內向，英國願竭其全力，保證他做印度的國王，而英國所需求的酬報，不過能繼續自由貿易而已。</p>
<p>克萊夫是無事不與瑪格勒蒂磋商的。他和瑪格勒蒂說了，她疑惑起來道：「這似乎超出了你的軍事範圍之外了。」克萊夫傲然道：「我們現在一定要運用政治手腕乎。我們現在的工作，是帝國的創造！」他於是就去和密爾耶法秘密談判起來。密爾耶法居然表示容納了他的意思，但是必須英國駐印度海軍大將華德生簽字，密爾耶法才肯答應。克萊夫於是又不得不去和華德生磋商。</p>
<p>海軍大將華德生是個年老肥碩的英國海軍前輩。他起初聽見了是密爾耶法答應他，如果他簽了那張密約。他願意每年賠送他現欵四萬鎊，他未免為之怦然心動。他手裏拿着筆，爬在桌上細細讀着那張密約的條文，尋覓着那四萬鎊一年的禮物，是否載明。他正要簽字，忽然又害怕起來，將手縮回了。他心想如果這事不成功……如果他們戰敗了……那個密約落在別人手裏……上面有他的名字……那時將如之何呢？他是老成持重的人。這一塊肥肉却吞不下去。他於是頻頻搖着頭道：「不興，不興。我的良心不允許這件事。」</p>
<p>克萊夫道：「如果你不簽字，一切計劃全歸失敗了，帝國亦不成立了。」但是華德生一次起了疑懼之後，克萊夫無論如何解說，已不能再打動他的心了。他所怕的是密爾耶法的反覆，但是他却口口聲聲說他的良心不允許他做那種勾當。</p>
<p>華德生走了，艾德蒙跑了進來。他看了克萊夫臉上失望的神氣，就說道：「那末一切都完了。密爾耶法一定要傾其全力以向我們了。」克萊夫眉頭縐着，忽然仰天大笑起來道：「這件事一定要照着原計劃進行，不能就這樣功敗垂成的。」艾德蒙正在驚駭之中，克萊夫已經提起筆來，在那張密約上簽了：「却爾司華德生」的名字了。</p>
<p>文德蒙駭然道：「他會知道的。」克萊夫道：「如果戰爭勝利了，華德生就是第一個搶着要承認這密約的人。你拿這個交給密爾耶法好了！」他說完了，身體倒在椅子裏，手持着舊傷又發的頭。艾德蒙在旁喊了一聲：「勞伯特！」克萊夫又吩咐道：「傳命下去。明天清早進兵！」</p>
<p>到了明天清早，克萊夫穿着一身軍裝，站在窗口，聽着外面的號聲，已經準備要出發了。步兵一隊一隊的開過去。許多象和駱駝背着軍火，槍砲，食糧，亦都出發了。這比幾年以前的「瘋人隊」，整齊得多了，但是却還遠不及薩爾烏特都拉的大軍。（未完）</p>

<p>(Kaifeng) Li Yi Society is scheduled to return to Bian on the 27th. The Yellow River Conservancy Commission is scheduled to convene the river bureaus of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces on the 28th to discuss protective measures for dangerous projects and strengthen the Golden Dike, with construction scheduled to begin on the [Day missing]th of April. Currently, 80% of the river's flow goes northward from Guantaibei. If the breach cannot be closed before the flood season, the water will inevitably divert north along the Zhangwei River. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The Hebei Provincial Government dispatched Ye Zhenmin, a commissioner investigating the Yellow River disaster, who reported that the water around Changyuan City is five to six feet deep, up to seven to eight feet in some places. Many houses have collapsed, presenting a scene of utter desolation. Each day, 7,729 adults and 2,148 children depend on congee for sustenance. The water level at the Taixing Embankment rises approximately one meter per day, with the water surface now only two feet from the top of the embankment, posing an extreme danger. Southern winds are causing erosion, creating a constant threat of collapse. Residents of Puyang County in southern Hebei have telegraphed the province, stating that the Golden Dike is incomplete and dilapidated, requiring a collective effort from several North China provinces for thorough reinforcement, a task beyond the capacity of a single county. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) The Yellow River water at Tongguan surged dramatically on the 22nd and 23rd, rising one meter higher than usual, with the flow rate also doubling. The Tongguan hydrological station has telegraphed downstream areas to be vigilant, as this is likely due to the melting of snow in the upper reaches, causing the "peach blossom flood." (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xi'an) Has and others inspected the Jing and Luo canals. They departed from the provincial capital on the 23rd, touring Zhou Mausoleum and Mao Mausoleum. They inspected the Jing Canal at noon and arrived in Dali County via Sanyuan at 8 PM. They inspected the Luo Canal on the morning of the 24th and will arrive at Tongguan that evening. Zhang Ji accompanied Has on a tour of the Zhou Mausoleum and then returned to the provincial capital. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Taiyuan) Prince Suo, accompanied by his family and 48 followers, departed from Wutai County this morning. Representatives including Wang Ping, previously sent by the Executive Yuan to welcome them, guided them in multiple cars. They arrived at Hebian Village at noon to meet with the Executive Yuan, had a brief discussion and lunch. They arrived at Bing [Taiyuan] at 6 PM. Both the Suiyuan and Shanxi provincial governments, as well as military and political figures, sent representatives to the station to welcome them. Prince Suo and his entourage are staying at the Shanxi Grand Hotel. They are scheduled to visit various military and political figures tomorrow morning and tour the sights of Bing City, staying for approximately one or two days before returning to Ping [Beiping]. Zhao Daiwen and others are scheduled to host a banquet at the government office tomorrow evening. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Prince Suo of Xilin Gol League went to Mount Wutai last month to worship Buddha and, at the invitation of the Executive Yuan, went to Bing before going to Hebian Village to meet with the Executive Yuan. After the matter is completed, he is scheduled to leave Bing on the 26th to come to Ping [Beiping], and after a brief stay, he will go to Bailing Temple. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e3">The Dispute Over Taxes Between Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia Suddenly Becomes Complicated; Suiyuan Sends Additional Personnel to Beiping to Negotiate; Song Zheyuan Believes It Is Unrelated to Chahar Province <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Beiping) The dispute over taxes between Suiyuan and Inner Mongolia has suddenly become complicated. Suiyuan has specifically dispatched Li Zhizheng, the chief of the anti-smoking investigation bureau, to Beiping to assist Shi Huayan in conducting negotiations. Mr. Li arrived in Beiping this morning. Song Zheyuan said that the Suiyuan-Mongolia tax issue has no connection with Chahar Province. Prince De previously sent a telegram involving the issue of protecting the Zhangjiakou- [Mongolia] automobile road, which is clearly related to Chahar Province. Therefore, I immediately telegraphed Prince De, expressing two points: (1) Chahar Province will never interfere with taxes in Mongolian territory. (2) The Zhangjiakou-Gansu automobile route is fundamentally impassable. Previously, merchants from Zhangjiakou attempted to transport goods into Gansu with four automobiles to scout the route, but their whereabouts are unknown. Furthermore, there are large areas of quicksand near Dengkou, making it difficult not only for automobiles to pass, but even for pedestrians to traverse. Since the Zhangjiakou-Gansu automobile route is impassable, the Suiyuan-Mongolia tax dispute involving Chahar Province is fundamentally not an issue. Prince De has now sent a reply telegram, expressing understanding of Chahar Province's views, and stating that the current dispute is not entirely about taxes, while also requesting the implementation of the political powers granted by the central government. I am scheduled to return to Zhangjiakou next week with Xiao Zhenying and Qin Decun. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Li Zhizheng said that the Suiyuan-Mongolia tax dispute is currently being discussed in Beiping. Suiyuan attaches great importance to this issue, as it concerns national sovereignty and local finances. Suiyuan Province includes various Mongolian banners, namely the Ulanqab League and the Yeke-juu League, totaling thirteen leagues and banners. Eighteen customs stations have been established in various Mongolian areas in Suiyuan where county governments have been established. The remaining uncultivated areas are governed by various Mongolian princes. The Mongolian Political Council was established with the mission of handling education and land reclamation in the Mongolian territories, and is a local autonomous organization without administrative power. The Mongolian side's request to have both established and unestablished counties governed by the Mongolian Political Council is not specified in the eight principles of Mongolian local autonomy, nor does the central government have such provisions. Therefore, the old regulations should still be followed, with the already established Mongolian counties governed by the Suiyuan Provincial Government, and the unestablished Mongolian banners still governed by the Mongolian princes. Regarding the establishment of checkpoints at Heishazha, Uhei Usu, Bayan Mountain, and Daiting Temple, there are checkpoints at all camel transport routes. The seventh item of the autonomy principles clearly stipulates that the Mongolian side does not have the independent right to establish checkpoints, but goods passing through Suiyuan must pay taxes before being released. Suiyuan's troops stationed in the above three locations are to defend against bandits and small groups led by Yang Hou, and are unrelated to the tax issue. I will stay in Beiping for five or six days before returning to Suiyuan. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Song Zheyuan said that after the Chahar eastern issue was resolved, the region is still peaceful. After Li Shouxin established the Chahar Eastern Special District Administrative Office in Dolon Nor, there have been no other activities. The Mongolian Salt Lake is located three hundred li north of Dolon Nor, and recently the Japanese are buying it up, but it has little to do with Chahar Province's salt, as Chahar Province still has Changlu Salt and Yuying Salt, which are lower in price than Mongolian salt. Prince De recently sent a lengthy telegram to Bao Yueqing to present to He. The telegram largely requested that Suiyuan abolish the tax collection offices and sub-checkpoints in Mongolian territories such as Heshatu, Shandaimiao, and Taiyangmiao that have not yet established counties. I have already forwarded the telegram to He, and I heard that the tax issue is currently being negotiated and should be resolved appropriately in the near future. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tianjin) At 4:00 AM on the 23rd, over a hundred armed hoodlums suddenly arrived at the Australian-owned Zhaogezhuang Mine and forcibly prevented over five hundred workers from going to work on the sky bridge. Jin Qiu, the captain of the mine police team, led his troops to persuade them. The hoodlums made five demands, mostly to seek benefits for the contractor workers. The mine bureau sent Zhang Guanru, the director of the Tangshan Labor-Management Liaison Office, to mediate. The issue remained unresolved on the 24th. The workers were prevented from working, and the mine pits were under martial law by the security team. This incident was caused by the mine bureau's cancellation of the contract labor system in November of last year, allowing all workers to be self-contracted to avoid exploitation by the contractor workers, which caused a disturbance. The contractor workers felt that their interests had been taken away and were unwilling to comply, so they hired hoodlums to cause trouble. (24th Special Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e9">Sichuan New Games Association Established; Chairman Chiang's Admonition; Four Points Must Be Noted to Promote New Life <a href="#e9" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c9" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">9</a></h3>
<p>(Chongqing) On the 23rd, Chairman Chiang attended the inauguration ceremony of the Chongqing New Life Movement Promotion Association and said that there are several points that must be noted in promoting the New Life Movement. First, to implement the New Life, one should start with the word "Li" (禮, etiquette). The so-called "Li" does not mean kowtowing three times and kneeling nine times, or bowing and raising hands, but refers to all proper attitudes, that is, all reasonable actions of self-discipline and dealing with people. As far as society and the country are concerned, it is the so-called order and discipline. Therefore, we should have "Li" at all times, in all places, and in all things. As the ancients said, "Do not speak improperly, do not move improperly, do not look improperly, do not listen improperly." We must pay special attention to the promotion of the New Life Movement and make the general public do it first. Second, the goal of the New Life Movement is to militarize, productivize, and artisticize the lives of the people. Third, in the Chinese mainland, the lifestyle, spirit, and actions of ordinary foreigners generally conform to the principles of the New Life. We should learn from their strengths and make up for our shortcomings. Fourth, in the future promotion of the New Life Movement, we should focus on leading by example, promoting the habit of labor, and the spirit of serving society. That is, the so-called "exerting their strength without leaving their bodies," and "not for oneself" in the Book of Rites, and the so-called "Everyone should aim to serve and not to take" by Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The more intelligent and capable people should use their abilities to serve hundreds of thousands of people and create happiness for hundreds of thousands of people. People with slightly less intelligence and ability should use their abilities to serve tens of hundreds of people and create happiness for tens of hundreds of people. All comrades who are determined to promote the New Life Movement should have labor service organizations. In addition to their own work, everyone should serve the society or the public for at least one hour or more. In addition, Chongqing City should pay attention to improving two things. First, there are very few cigarette advertisements in Chongqing, which is a very gratifying phenomenon, but on the other hand, there are many advertisements for panaceas and elixirs for the treatment of various dishonorable diseases, while advertisements related to academic, cultural, and educational matters are not easy to see, and the advertisements do not specify locations or pay attention to cleanliness. From this, we can see the moral and cultural decline of society and the incompetence of the police. We should know that the content and form of advertisements have a great influence on the spirit and psychology of the people. In the future, if there are advertisements that do not comply with the regulations, it is hoped that the New Life Movement Association will cooperate with the local authorities to pay attention to suppression. (2) There are many unemployed vagrants and beggars in Chongqing. The government authorities, leaders from all walks of life, and comrades of the New Life Movement Promotion Association should work together to design, based on the principles of labor service, to persuade, organize, and train them, and make them engage in various construction undertakings. As long as the government and leaders from all walks of life cooperate fully, it will be easy to do. In short, after the establishment of the Chongqing New Life Movement Promotion Association, it is hoped that the government authorities, leaders from all walks of life, and all New Life comrades will lead by example and work together to lay the foundation for building a new Sichuan and setting an example for all parts of the country, etc. (24th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e14">Issue of Tax Reduction on Domestic Goods Exports <a href="#e14" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c14" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">14</a></h3>
<p>(Nanjing) Regarding the issue of reducing or exempting export taxes on domestic goods, a certain tax official said that the total value of domestic goods exports last year was 53,521,429 yuan, which is a decrease of over 7,661,000 yuan compared with the total export value of 61,182,790 yuan in 1933. This decrease has certainly affected the industry, but last year's import surplus was also significantly reduced compared with the previous year. As for the reduction and exemption methods, they are currently being discussed and it is inconvenient to speculate. However, textile fibers have always been the highest among domestic goods exports, but last year animal and animal products were the most, totaling over 77 million yuan for the whole year, followed by yarn, silk fabrics, and knitwear, totaling over 75 million yuan, while the former exported over 11.4 million yuan in the previous year, and plummeted to over 7.4 million yuan last year, falling from the first place to the third place. This situation should of course be taken into consideration when studying the reduction and exemption. However, it is definitely not just a simple tariff issue that affects its sales. In addition, tea exports increased by over one million yuan compared with the previous year, tobacco increased by over two million yuan, raw hides, tanned hides, and leather goods decreased by over two million yuan, coarse grains decreased by over two million yuan, oil [seeds] decreased by over five million yuan, fuel increased by over one million yuan, and piece goods decreased by over 16 million yuan. The fewest exports were sugar, with only over 13,000 yuan for the whole year last year. The above increase or decrease situation should be considered in terms of which are domestic needs, which are stagnant due to foreign goods dumping, and which are not enough to compete in foreign markets due to lack of improved production. In addition, although other categories have also increased or decreased slightly, the amounts are not large. As for the plan to separately reduce or exempt, its principle should be to focus on promoting domestic products, but the size of its reduction and exemption scope must take into account the social situation, and it is not possible to predict at this time.

The business of all small and medium-sized prize-linked savings banks will be wound up when the Trust Bureau of the Central Bank is established. The Central Bank Trust Bureau will take over, and all unexpired depositors of the various banks will continue to pay their savings to the respective banks in accordance with the original deposit methods, and will handle them on their behalf, together with the benefits they have earned. As for new depositors, the Trust Bureau will no longer accept them. The purpose of this measure is to protect the interests of the original depositors and to have a definite time to end. Before implementation, opinions will be exchanged with domestic and foreign savings banks before a deadline for implementation is set. (24th Dispatch)</p>

<h3 id="e35">The Terror of the Yellow River Disaster Strikes Again <a href="#e35" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c35" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">35</a></h3>
<p>— Du</p>
<p>The Yellow River's engineering situation. Suddenly, a critical report has emerged. The Puyang Jin embankment. Largely destroyed. The Guantai blockage. Unlikely to close. And the river's water level rising day by day. The flow gradually becoming fierce. Remotely remembering the disaster victims in the Lu-Yu area. Old pains not yet recovered. New worries gather again. In the mire, the mud. Fear and trepidation. The feeling of grief. Need not be deeply discussed. Now is just the beginning of spring. Yet it already presents a surging trend. In a blink of an eye, a great overflow will arrive. Breaching the dikes and changing course. Invading Wei and seizing Huai. Not only will Hebei lose its protection. But Jiangsu and Anhui will also suffer. Therefore, the fact of river defense. Is the most serious and urgent problem at present. The people of the whole country. Should be as the hands and feet protecting the head and eyes. United in mind and strength. Swiftly and promptly to go forth.</p>
<p>Water management work. Has always been regarded as difficult to achieve. Only by effective supervision. Can a slight effect of treating the symptoms be achieved. During the Qing Dynasty. The Yellow River breached its banks thirty-nine times. Since the overflow in Zhengzhou in the thirteenth year of Guangxu. For decades, it has been relatively calm. Just when stability and control of the river were anticipated. Who would have thought that one breach the year before last. Would again cause a major disaster. At that time, the disaster area covered. Five provinces and reached. Fifty counties. The disaster area was. As large as more than 15,000 square miles. The disaster victims numbered four million. The time lasted eight months. It cannot be said to be a great and overflowing inundation. Afterwards, although the flood period passed. The blockage project. Has not progressed. The disaster victims' pleas. Are reported incessantly. Finally, there was the breach in Changyuan last autumn. And the suffering in Hua County. Since then, the Yellow River. The terror of the disaster is deeply rooted. People's hearts and the engineering situation are dangerous. It is often felt to be difficult. At the beginning of the ice flood. It has become a serious situation. Although it is a natural disaster. Is it not also a failure of human planning?</p>
<p>We have also anxiously pondered. To find the crux of the problem. To say that the authorities are indifferent to the river management project. The government has set up various levels of water conservancy agencies to manage it. The organization is grand. Those belonging to the central government. Are the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. The North China Water Conservancy Commission. Those belonging to the local government. Are the Yellow River River Affairs Bureaus of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan provinces. When the water disaster broke out the year before last. A Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee was specially established to supervise it. And its integration into the National Economic Commission. Its measures cannot be said to be not detailed. To say that the authorities have no solution to the river management. The Executive Yuan did discuss prevention and blockage. First, the six-province flood control conference decided on the steps later. And the Shandong Provincial River Affairs Bureau's proposed plan to repair and dredge the Yellow River estuary and. The outline for Yellow River management proposed by Li Yizhi, chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission. Are all insightful. Orderly and organized. The government has not been without solutions. However, it has ultimately not helped the overflow of the water. To see this tense situation again. What is the reason? We are not clever. Dare to cover it in one sentence and say. Although there are many agencies, no one is truly responsible. Although there are methods. But those below do not implement them vigorously. Precisely because no one is responsible. Criticisms are numerous. Fittingly increasing excuses for shifting blame. Precisely because they are not implemented vigorously. Documents fly about. Only seeing empty words. Last year, the disaster victims in western Shandong sent a telegram appealing for the blockage of the breach. It was said. "Personally went to the mouth to check. Although the dry mouth is closed. The water mouth has not yet moved. Even if there is equipment. The work is not at all tense." Li Yizhi also said after inspecting the river work. "The river works in the three provinces have not used new methods. The follow-up projects are particularly sloppy." And the supervisory committee member Zhou Lisheng's report after being dispatched to investigate the situation of the Changyuan breach. Even directly said "The old dikes are not solid at all. Afterwards, when the disaster occurred. The protection was not vigorous." These are all indications of the facts. There is something that is difficult to conceal.</p>
<p>At this time today. With the dangerous situation in front of us. We truly do not need to look for the gaps of the past. To make pointless resistance. Only by gathering the strength of everyone can we jointly. Quell the great disaster. Looking at the opinions of certain important members of the Jinghui. It seems that the non-identity of powers and responsibilities has also been seen. And the Tianjin telegram came. It said that the new engineering office has been established. Kong Xiangrong and Li Yizhi are responsible for blocking the breach and cultivating the dikes. A unified command will be seen. Old malpractices will be corrected. And a new era will be ushered in. Hanging up the overturned cart to warn future generations. This is what is hoped for from the efforts of all the gentlemen.</p>

<p>(Harbin) This question concerns the arsenal in the southeastern suburbs, which exploded at 11:00 AM this morning, shaking the entire city. The number of deaths and injuries is unknown, but the dead must number at least dozens, with even more injured. Many nearby houses were burnt down. Within a mile, all glass windows were shattered. Bullets flew everywhere, and residents were terrified. As of 6:00 PM this evening, the sounds of explosions had not completely subsided. Only one ammunition depot has not yet been affected, but it is feared that it will not be spared in the end. Military authorities have dispatched troops to surround the arsenal and prevent people from approaching. Manchu and Japanese soldiers are making every effort to put out the fire, but have failed to extinguish it. (24th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) At 10:55 AM today, the arsenal of the Chinese Eastern Railway guard troops in Majiagou, between the Japanese barracks and the airfield south of the city, suddenly exploded several times. All the cannons, large and small, and shells, etc., in the arsenal were completely destroyed. Nearby residents fled to other places. Japanese aircraft inspected the state of the explosion from the air. The sounds of explosions subsided at 12:10 AM, but five or six large warehouses of the nearby Chinese Eastern Railway guard troops were burned down. The explosive sounds shocked the entire city of Harbin. The ammunition depot of the army and navy, 200 meters away, was also on alert for an explosion. In addition, the nearby troops have all been concentrated in Harbin to take charge of security in the city. On the other hand, the large glass windows of the Tonglun Foreign Firm in New City Street, one and a half miles away, were also shattered by the explosive sounds, resulting in great losses. As for the cause of the explosion, it is currently under investigation. Also, the fire was extinguished at 1:00 PM. Residents who had fled to other places have also returned to their homes, and order has been restored. (24th Dentu Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Harbin) When the arsenal of the Chinese Eastern Railway guard troops exploded, many of the glass windows and doors of shops in the Majiagou area were shattered. Those who took refuge flocked to New City Street, creating a tragic scene inside and outside Harbin. Fortunately, no people or animals were injured. However, two guards have already fled. The sounds of explosions ceased at 1:00 PM, and people's hearts have also returned to calm. The cause of the explosion is currently unknown, and the losses are also difficult to estimate.

<h3 id="e37">After the Illegal Sale of the Eastern Route, Japan Plans to Resolve the Outstanding Issues Between Russia and Japan, Starting with the Fishing Treaty and Oil Rights.

<p>(Tokyo) After the sale of the Chinese Eastern Railway, Foreign Minister Hirota plans to resolve all outstanding issues between Russia and Japan. Foreign Minister Hirota has decided to order Ambassador to Russia Ota Kichiji to return to Russia in early April to negotiate with the Moscow government on the ruble exchange rate, the revision of the fishing treaty, and other outstanding issues. In addition, Kozlovsky, the Russian Foreign Affairs Committee's Far East Minister, who came to Japan to participate in the Chinese Eastern Railway negotiations, is scheduled to depart tomorrow, taking a ship from Tsuruga to Vladivostok, and returning to the Russian capital via Siberia. (24th China United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Foreign Minister Hirota answered the following questions on the North Pacific Fisheries Control Law Committee in the House of Representatives on the 24th regarding the revision of the Japan-Soviet fisheries treaty and the purchase of North Sakhalin Island:</p>
<p>(1) The Soviet Union operates North Pacific fisheries as a state-run enterprise, adopting complete control and management. Therefore, Japan must also focus on protecting national interests and confront it. It is still appropriate to organize a large-scale fisheries company to control it. If a unified agency for fisheries companies is established, I feel that Japan will have an advantage in the negotiations on revising the Japan-Soviet fisheries treaty, and it will be profitable. As for the ruble issue that has become an outstanding issue, although it has not reached a final resolution, it may be possible to conclude it at the time of revising the treaty. (2) Japan has long wished to promote the transfer of North Sakhalin Island. When Mr. Ye Fei visited the East, this issue was also formally discussed. The Soviet Union has no objection to the sale, but it has not reached an agreement on the purchase price and has been delayed until today. It is not yet known whether the Soviet Union still intends to sell it as before, but I sincerely hope that this period will come. As for the trial digging of oil mines and the exploitation of forests, etc., I hope that the activities of Japan in the economy will not cause diplomatic obstacles.

<p>Establishment of a Price Arbitration Committee</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Chinese Eastern Railway Transfer Agreement was officially signed on the 23rd, and at the same time, the first installment of 23.3 million yuan in cash was paid. About two-thirds of the total price of the road is in the form of material payments, and the total amount will be paid off in the next three years. When implementing it, when there is disagreement between "Manchuria" and the Soviet Union regarding the determination of the price of goods, the price arbitration ruling committee selected by Japan, "Manchuria," and the Soviet Union will obstruct the discussion and exercise the decision. Yesterday, when the agreement was signed, the decision of the arbitration committee was discussed as a matter for later discussion. Now, after consultations between Japan, "Manchuria," and the Soviet Union, the general situation has been decided as follows on the 24th: (1) The Price Arbitration Ruling Committee will be located in Tokyo. (2) The Japanese side's committee member has decided to appoint Mr. Kurisu, the director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' Trade Bureau. The "Manchukuo" side's committee member is Mr. Hoshino, the director of the Ministry of Finance (but in practice, the administrative officer Mr. Ito will be his agent). The Soviet side's committee members are Mr. Laichter, the counselor of the Soviet Embassy in Japan, and Mr. Zelezhnijakov, the first secretary of the embassy. (24th Japan United Press)</p>
<p>A Russian Newspaper Publishes an Article to Comfort Itself</p>
<p>(Moscow) The Soviet government's gazette, Izvestia, has an article entitled "The Consolidation of Peace in the Far East," discussing the official signing of the Chinese Eastern Railway sales agreement. It said: "This move, whether viewed from the perspective of general development or from the current situation in the Far East, is an important political event. The Chinese Eastern Railway was once a tool for Tsarist Russian imperialism to carry out its aggressive policies in the Far East. At that time, it helped to divide China. The relationship of the Russian masses to this policy was only that they had to use their own labor to make this tool for implementing imperialist policies, and at the same time, they had to sacrifice their blood for the results of this policy. Later, the proletariat overthrew the Tsarist Russian regime and eliminated the rule of the bourgeoisie, but it could not simply abandon the Chinese Eastern Railway empty-handed, because a large amount of national funds had been invested in the road. Not only that, but the proletariat had striven to prevent the road from collapsing, so that it would not be affected by the warlord melee, and then transferred it to the Chinese people, so that the road would become a tool for the two major countries to practice friendship. Although the last point was impossible to achieve, until today, China has still failed to get rid of the shackles of foreign imperialism. Because of the setbacks of the Chinese masses, China has become increasingly weak. Therefore, Manchuria has separated from China, and foreign troops have controlled Chinese territory. As a result, armed conflicts have occurred. This kind of conflict is most intense near the railway. If the business of the Chinese Eastern Railway is not protected by strong military force, it cannot be carried out peacefully. Since the Soviet Union has resolutely abandoned the Tsarist Russian era's territorial expansion and colonial plundering policy, it can never maintain the business of the Chinese Eastern Railway by force, because if force is used, it is tantamount to participating in the imperialist division of Manchuria. There is already a 'regime' in Manchuria. In order to preserve the people's investment in the road as much as possible, and in order to avoid conflicts (this kind of conflict often occurs around the Chinese Eastern Railway and at the same time threatens peace), the Soviet Union deems it necessary to sell the Chinese Eastern Railway to this 'regime.'"</p>
<p>"The enemies of the Soviet Union and the Chinese people have said that this matter shows the Soviet Union's setbacks in the Far East," and they want to use this to alienate the nationals of the Soviet Union and China. The enemies of the Soviet Union hope that the Chinese Eastern Railway dispute will cause a war, but the Soviet Union's peace policy and its strong strength have shattered this hope, forcing those who love to plunder to abandon their idea of solving the Chinese Eastern Railway problem without an agreement. Now there are some people who think that since the Chinese Eastern Railway problem has not caused a war, they should at least use its peaceful solution to alienate the Chinese nationals from the Soviet Union, but this move will also be in vain. Chinese patriots with brains will be able to see through that if this road can be transferred to the representatives of the great Chinese nation, then what pleasure would the Soviet Union not have? The Soviet Union's broad masses of people cherish the friendship of the Chinese nationals extremely. Unfortunately, the Chinese nation is no longer the master of Manchuria. Once the road becomes a target of contention, and this important Far East transportation route is destroyed in one fell swoop, then what benefit will it have? The Soviet government insists on avoiding conflicts in the Far East no matter what, because this is not only to maintain the Soviet Union's national defense or Soviet interests. The Chinese Eastern Railway sales agreement was then announced successfully. Izvestia said, "We hope that the Japanese government can fulfill all its obligations and faithfully fulfill the signed agreement. This point is of great benefit to the consolidation of Soviet-Japanese relations. There are still several disputes between the Soviet Union and Japan. Their resolution must be conducted through serious negotiations with the spirit of mutual concession, understanding, and concern for the promotion of peace between the two nations. If these kinds of negotiations are to have meaning and can have satisfactory results, then the Japanese government must express its willingness to fulfill the agreement every day when implementing the Chinese Eastern Railway agreement. Today, 'The European side is putting peace to a serious test. The Far East can now untie a knot of dispute, which is doubly joyful, because the Far East is the center of the greatest war crisis. The Soviet Union's policy combines the firm effort to strive for peace with the belief that maintaining peace requires a force worthy of respect, so it can complete this task. The Soviet people should welcome this decision on the Chinese Eastern Railway, because it is a factor in promoting peace in the Far East. They hope that the Soviet Union will be able to achieve this goal in all places where peace is threatened in its continued struggle to maintain peace." (24th TASS Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Tokyo) Yesterday, the House of Representatives Budget General Committee reopened at 4:25 PM. Masayoshi Kimura of the Seiyukai asked about the positive reasons for establishing the Cabinet Deliberation Council. Prime Minister Okada replied that it is necessary to gather wisdom and deliberate on various important issues today, when domestic and foreign situations are diverse and the future is difficult to predict. This organ was established from this point of view. Next, Mr. Funada of the Seiyukai asked about the Japanese-Soviet relations after the establishment of the Eastern Route transfer negotiations. Foreign Minister Hirota replied that the establishment of the Eastern Route transfer negotiations is sufficient to open the way for the improvement of relations between Japan, the Soviet Union, and "Manchuria." Funada continued to ask whether "Manchukuo" has sufficient funds to pay the Japanese receiving banking group that is receiving the country's national debt, and what is the scope of the empire's guarantee. The Foreign Minister replied, ""Manchukuo has sufficient confidence in payment. Funada asked whether the Soviet Union acknowledges "Manchukuo" because the transfer negotiations have been established. The Foreign Minister replied that because this treaty has been established, the relationship between the Soviet Union and "Manchuria" should be closer and more obvious. Funada asked what the facts are regarding China's protests against the transfer negotiations. The Foreign Minister replied that although China sent official documents, they did not strongly demand a reply. Funada also asked the Foreign Minister about Germany's declaration, saying that since Germany has abandoned the Treaty of Versailles, will it demand the return of the South Pacific mandated territories from Japan. The Foreign Minister replied that Japan cannot clearly state what countermeasures it will take at this moment, but my intention is that it should not affect the Far East immediately. I have previously asked the German Ambassador to Japan various questions to inquire about Germany's true intentions. The German Ambassador stated that there would be no demand for the return of the mandated territories. Also, the rumor that Japan and Germany have signed a secret treaty is completely baseless.

<p>(London) After a sincere exchange of views in Paris yesterday among the representatives of Britain, France, and Italy regarding German rearmament, doubts were dispelled and harmony restored. The British Lord Privy Seal, Eden, the French Foreign Minister, Laval, and the Italian Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Suvich, met at the French Foreign Ministry from 1:20 AM to 5:10 PM yesterday, with only a short break for lunch. The result was complete agreement. Before the meeting adjourned, it was decided to hold a further conference on April 11 in Stresa, on Lake Maggiore in northern Italy. According to sources in Rome, the Italian government warmly welcomes inviting Germany to participate, as the Italian government's policy of advocating a four-power compromise is not new. British, French, and Italian circles have all expressed satisfaction with the outcome of yesterday's talks in Paris. The French and Italian sides now sympathize with Foreign Secretary Simon and Eden's visit to Berlin, and Eden's subsequent visits to Moscow, Warsaw, and Prague. London is particularly pleased. The characteristic of yesterday's talks in Paris was that France and Italy consistently supported Britain's position. (Reuters, 24th)</p>
<p>Official Communiqué Issued</p>
<p>(Paris) The following communiqué was issued after the meeting:</p>
<p>"The French Foreign Minister, Laval, the British Lord Privy Seal, Eden, and the Italian Undersecretary of State for Foreign Affairs, Suvich, met today at the French Foreign Ministry to exchange views on the general situation. During the talks, it was reiterated that the visit of the British cabinet members to Berlin was of an exploratory nature, and that the scope and objectives of the British-German talks would be based entirely on the provisions of the London Declaration of February 3. The governments of Britain, France, and Italy hold a unified opinion on this matter. The talks also decided that, after the British cabinet members have visited Germany and continued their visits to the Soviet Union, Poland, and Czechoslovakia (all of which are supported by the French and Italian governments), the foreign ministers of Britain, France, and Italy should hold a meeting in Stresa, Italy, on April 11. Laval, Eden, and Suvich expressed great satisfaction with the complete unity of contact among the three governments. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>France and Italy Express Satisfaction</p>
<p>(Paris) The talks between Britain, France, and Italy today ended at 5:10 PM. Political figures are deeply satisfied with the communiqué issued after the meeting, which stated that the three governments are in agreement. It is generally believed that today's talks gave French Foreign Minister Laval an opportunity to reiterate France's position on German rearmament, namely, that Germany's current rebuilding of its army not only gives Germany the military equality it demands, but also makes the German army larger than those of its neighbors. Therefore, in future talks, France cannot recognize this decision by Germany.</p>
<p>Rome Italian newspapers commented favorably on the outcome of yesterday's trilateral talks in Paris, stating that the Rome Agreement of January 7 and the London Agreement of February 3 had already demonstrated the unity of views of Britain, France, and Italy. The Paris Conference reaffirmed this, and therefore the conference is sufficient to establish a strong foundation for future negotiations and is of great spiritual importance. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Collective Security System</p>
<p>The Anglo-French declaration of February 3 solemnly stated that Germany would only be allowed to change its military system if Europe obtained a collective security system. France still advocates concluding mutual assistance pacts in Eastern and Central Europe to seek collective security. Laval also mentioned this during today's talks.</p>
<p>No Mention of Economic Sanctions</p>
<p>Although news reports said that the possibility of economic sanctions against Germany was discussed at today's trilateral meeting, this was not actually mentioned. The most important future development in European diplomacy will be the visit of British Foreign Secretary Simon to Berlin. Simon's visit to Berlin will be exploratory in nature, and its outcome will not be binding on France and Italy. After Eden has visited Russia, Poland, and Czechoslovakia, the British and French foreign ministers will jointly travel to Stresa, Italy, to hold a trilateral meeting with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini. The extraordinary meeting of the Council of the League of Nations may be held after the Stresa meeting. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<h3 id="e41">German Conscription Law to Be Promulgated Imminently <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(Berlin) The government will promulgate a conscription law tomorrow to implement the compulsory military service system announced on March 16. This law was originally intended to be published as soon as possible, but it was likely delayed until now because British Foreign Secretary Simon was about to visit Germany, and it was not appropriate to rush the matter before his visit was confirmed. Some newspapers say that the government intends to discuss this issue with Foreign Secretary Simon, and therefore to publish this law. The method of implementing compulsory military service can be glimpsed from the writings of several military experts. Major Weigelt, a member of the Ministry of Defense, recently published an article explaining the educational significance of conscription, saying that German soldiers want to inject new elements into the life of the Third Reich. Captain Wedel, another member of the Ministry of Defense, said that the new military organization is based on the principles of the imperial era. Citizens from the age of eighteen to forty-five should be conscripted. Those aged nineteen to twenty-one are assigned to the regular army, those aged twenty-one to thirty-five are assigned to the reserve army, and those aged thirty-five to forty-five are assigned to the auxiliary reserve army. The current quota for the regular army is as high as 300,000 men, but due to financial constraints, it may not be possible to conscript all of them, and their training will be completed in other ways. On this point, General Metzsch believes that military training can be carried out in the Nazi Party's military academies, middle schools, and primary schools. He said, "Primary school teachers should be assistants to military training officers. We must make the maximum effort in military affairs." It is noted that the training provided by the German Labor Service Organization is actually no different from military training. (Havas, 24th)</p>

<p>(Rome) News today indicates that Italy is prepared to immediately recall six classes of soldiers. If recalled, Prime Minister Mussolini will have a large army of 1.5 million men under his command. In addition, there are 400,000 Fascist troops who can be mobilized immediately if necessary. According to informed sources in the capital, Mussolini does not want to disrupt peace, but only wants to defend Italy and resist any foreign aggression. Therefore, he has ordered all Italian soldiers to be prepared to be dispatched at any time. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government is successively dispatching reserve soldiers from the 1911 to 1914 classes to the military. By April 15, the actual strength of the Italian army will be 560,000 men. The Italian government considers this measure to be a precautionary measure. According to Prime Minister Mussolini, "Italy must have adequate defenses so that Italy will be fearless in the face of any developments." In addition, Italy is paying close attention to the situation in Central Europe after German rearmament. Italy believes that since Germany has abolished the military clauses of the peace treaty, Hungary, Austria, and Bulgaria should do the same. It is also heard that Hungary may restore compulsory conscription before the upcoming elections. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The mobilization of reserve soldiers of the 1911 class by the Italian government is viewed by international figures here as purely a precautionary measure, even more so than the mobilization of troops due to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) After Italian Prime Minister Mussolini issued an order yesterday to call up the 1911 class of conscripts and delivered a passionate speech at the Blackshirt rally, the Italian people were extremely excited. The public is almost entirely discussing these two matters today and sees the Prime Minister's speech as aimed at Germany. (Reuters, 24th)</p>

<p>(London) The leader of the Conservative Party and Lord President of the Council, Baldwin, delivered a speech to the Imperial Youth Association at Albert Hall this afternoon, repeatedly expressing Britain's desire for peace and belief in the League of Nations. He said, "No country desires peace more than ours, and no one has worked harder for peace than we have. Since the Great War, the disarmament that we have long desired has not yet become a reality in the near future, which we must admit. However, the failure of disarmament should not be blamed on any country, nor should it be blamed on the League of Nations. The League of Nations now needs to gain friends, and I deeply hope that those who have been working for the League of Nations will work even harder for it in the future. In the current international situation, there is only one solution, namely, that countries agree on a treaty to limit armaments. The clauses on arms inspection in this treaty must be as strict as possible. If it is found that a signatory country's armaments exceed the quota and refuses inspection, other signatory countries should work together to deal with it." Baldwin then reiterated Simon and Eden's visits to Germany and Russia, wishing them a successful return. The audience applauded greatly. (Havas, 23rd)</p>

<p>(London) Diplomatic circles here learned today that Turkey is preparing to announce the implementation of armaments in the Dardanelles Strait area. This move may cause Greece and Bulgaria to also abolish demilitarized zones along their borders adjacent to Turkey. Russia will likely not oppose this move, as after the area is armed, it will be very difficult for enemies to invade Russian territorial waters. (National Telegram, 24th)</p>

<p>(Washington) After a long meeting, the leaders of the House government faction decided today to accept the Senate amendment to the War Department's increase in military quotas. The War Department's proposal was debated fiercely in the Senate, and the government was accused of having militaristic tendencies for demanding an increase in the regular army quota to 165,000 men. However, those who supported this plan said that even if the bill is passed, the US's military strength would only be equal to that of Czechoslovakia. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) After the Army budget bill was passed by the Senate, it was submitted to the House for discussion. Recently, the House Military Affairs Committee also voted to pass it.

<p>(Washington) Today, the Senate, following the House, passed President Roosevelt's $4,880,000,000 work relief bill by a vote of 66 to 16. This is the largest appropriation ever passed by both houses of Congress. Before the bill was passed, the Senate also passed the Democratic Senator Thomas's proposed amendment to the Silver Act, stipulating the following four articles: (1) The Treasury Department is ordered to issue silver certificates, using existing silver bars and silver purchased thereafter at a price of $1.29 per ounce as collateral. These silver certificates will be used to pay off maturing debts, so that they can circulate in the market. (2) After the Treasury Department receives these certificates, it should add the words "reissued" and continue to circulate them in the market. (3) (4) The Treasury Department is authorized to issue silver certificates at will, using silver obtained from selling gold to other countries, and silver paid by other countries to settle debts owed to the United States at a negotiated price as collateral. Although the Silver Amendment is now included in the original bill, it is expected that it will be deleted during the conference between the two houses.

<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has recently approved the Philippine Constitution. Those present included the Speaker of the Philippine Senate, Quezon (who may become the first President of the Philippines), the Speaker of the Philippine Constitutional Convention, Recto, and the current Governor-General of the Philippines, Murphy. The new Philippine government will be formally established in Manila in November of this year. The Philippine Constitution is entirely based on the US Constitution, stipulating that there will be a President and Vice President, each serving a term of six years. The Congress will only have a Senate, with 120 senators. There will also be a Supreme Court, with 11 justices. The Constitution states that war will not be used as an instrument of national policy. According to the law passed by the Philippine Congress, the Philippines should gain full independence within ten years. (Havas, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has approved the Philippine Constitution today, and the Philippines can immediately hold elections to establish a semi-autonomous government. The constitution is largely based on the Tydings-McDuffie Act. Today's signing by the President took place in the White House Cabinet Room. Those present included Philippine and American leaders such as Governor Murphy, Senate Speaker Quezon, Constitutional Convention Chairman Recto, Senator Tydings, Secretary of State Hull, and Secretary of War Dern. After the President's approval, he sent the nomination of Riffle to be a Justice of the Philippine Supreme Court to the Senate. The Philippine representatives then issued a statement thanking the President, saying, "This move further consolidates our confidence in the US government and increases our gratitude to the American people." The constitution states respect for US sovereignty and stipulates a bicameral legislature with senators serving six-year terms and representatives serving three-year terms. The current governor appointed by the US President will be replaced by a popularly elected president, serving a six-year term and not being eligible for reelection. The judicial system will be similar to the current system, with judges appointed by the President and approved by the Senate. The rights of the people are similar to the US Constitution. The issue of women's suffrage will need to be discussed by the National Assembly in the future, and can only be passed if more than 300,000 women vote in favor. The marriage system is based on equality between men and women, and freedom of religious belief is complete. (National Telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Washington) President Roosevelt has approved the constitution of the Philippine Islands today, allowing the Philippines to propose a republic ten years later. However, judging from the situation after today's ceremony, the final separation between the Philippines and the United States may have to be delayed. Many Philippine officials and American officials who are concerned about the Philippine independence struggle attended today's ceremony. After praising the constitution, President Roosevelt handed the approval document to Philippine Governor Murphy. Murphy then congratulated Philippine Senate Speaker Quezon, who is expected to be the first president of the Philippine autonomous government. The autonomous government will be established on November 15 of this year. Secretary of War Dern was also present at today's ceremony. Murphy will serve as the first US envoy to the Philippine Islands. He will now convene a special meeting of the Philippine legislature to decide on the date for holding a plebiscite to pass the constitution. According to the Philippines' new status, it will no longer enjoy the current free trade rights between the United States and the Philippines. Therefore, Murphy has been busy in recent days refining the economic relationship between the US and the Philippines. Murphy is currently afraid that if the United States suddenly erects tariff barriers against the Philippines, the new Philippine government will not be able to survive. Therefore, Murphy and Quezon are eager to establish a preferential mutual relationship between the US and the Philippines to preserve the current strong trade between the US and the Philippines. Quezon and his comrades are also very busy preparing for the start of a new democratic government in the East. The legislature will invite personnel from the US government, business community, and press, and invite foreign governments to send envoys to Manila in November of this year to participate in the ceremony for the establishment of the new government. After President Roosevelt approved the Philippine Constitution today, he said that he would appoint Philippine official Recto as President of the Philippine Supreme Court to reward him for his work as Chairman of the Drafting Committee. He also said, "The constitution that the Philippine Constitutional Committee presented to me is in line with the provisions of the Independence Act. I am very happy that the members have worked hard and completed a task that is vital to the life of their nation, which is worthy of celebration. The American and Philippine peoples, motivated by feelings of harmony, sympathy, and loyalty, are engaged in a great experiment. During the era of the autonomous government, this experiment will continue until the United States finally gives up its sovereignty over the Philippines and the Philippines gains complete independence." Then, the Philippine delegation and the staff members of the Philippine Office in the United States, Teldado and Guavara, all said that the Philippine people are extremely grateful to President Roosevelt for his generous approval of their constitution. President Roosevelt approved the constitution shortly after it was submitted, which is even more proof of President Roosevelt's generosity and attention to the happiness and freedom of the Filipino people. They also said that President Roosevelt's actions have strengthened our trust in the United States and increased our obligations to the United States. The Philippine Constitution stipulates the Philippine republican system and recognizes US sovereignty. Philippine officials swear allegiance to the United States. Risto's appointment as President of the Supreme Court is to fill the vacancy left by American official Street, who will resign on May 1. (Reuters, 23rd)</p>

<p>Warsaw The Polish constitution was established on March 17, 1921. On May 12, 1926, the current Minister of Military Affairs, General Piłsudski, staged a coup d'état, and a new constitution was created to strengthen government power. This new constitution was recently passed by the House of Representatives by a vote of 260 to 135. Members of the National Democratic Party, the Christian Social Party, the Socialist Party, and the Communist Party all voted against it. The Ukrainian Party and the Jewish Party abstained. The German Party did not participate in the discussion. (Havas, 24th)</p>
<p>Warsaw The characteristic of the new constitution passed by the House of Representatives today is that it expands the power of the President. The President is the Marshal of the Army and can decide to make peace and declare war. He appoints the Prime Minister, and the Prime Minister is responsible to the President, not to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives may request the removal of the cabinet or cabinet members, but the motion for removal should be passed by both houses of Congress. The President may issue certain documents without the countersignature of the Prime Minister. When the House of Representatives declares dissolution, the President may promulgate substitute legal orders, but not to change the constitution. The Senate election law still maintains the principle of selecting outstanding people. Two-thirds of its members should be elected by both houses of Congress from among citizens with outstanding achievements. The remaining one-third should be appointed by the President. Members of the House of Representatives should be elected by direct, general, proportional election law. Their term of office is five years. They have the right to initiate legislation and pass budgets. The government also has the right to initiate legislation. This new constitution does not take effect immediately, and it is not yet decided when it will take effect. As long as Minister of Military Affairs Piłsudski continues to hold supreme power, this new constitution is not of great importance. (Havas, 24th)</p>

Although the plans included in this have not been revealed, most people believe that Tieland will take rapid and decisive measures to balance the budget and help export trade to reverse the decline. The losses of major companies, the compression of wages (the trend of which is lower than the decline in the cost of living), and the crises of various banks are all included in the rescue list.

<p>On January 13th, the Saar people voted in a general election, and 90 percent (528,704 people) voted in favor of returning to the Fatherland, Germany. It has been more than a month now, and in two weeks, the Saar will change to a new environment. Before the vote was implemented, everyone was very excited and happy, thinking that light would come soon. In the atmosphere of patriotic enthusiasm and high-profile propaganda, they couldn't wait to return to the Fatherland, Germany.</p>
<p>The general election movement that had been waiting for fifteen years has passed. After the extreme excitement of the general residents, workers, small businessmen, farmers, etc., the Hitler government calculated an unprecedented victory. In fact, "Germanism" is just a coat worn by the National Socialist Party. Apart from this coat, how much of the true spirit of Germany is there? However, the swastika emblem is displayed everywhere, which is a new scene. The "everything" of the Saar local social system has been changed by the National Socialist Party. The former political organizations and commercial organizations have all been suspended or reorganized. For example, the Catholic Youth League, the Sports League, the Socialist Club, etc., have all been called "illegal organizations" and banned. This is exactly the dream that the minority faction pointed out during the vote about returning to the Fatherland. At least many people feel that life is inconvenient and not as good as they originally hoped.</p>
<p>After March 1st, the League of Nations Administration Committee was removed, followed by the withdrawal of international troops and the guards of the People's Voting Committee. The Saar will soon be peacefully handed over to Germany. The conflict between Germany and France may be reduced as a result. However, on the other hand, the French mobile units and customs offices, which had not been fortified between France and the Saar before, were all prepared before March 1st and were about to establish very strong defenses. All places where the Saar borders France immediately became the strict German-French border. On the surface, it still seems to maintain a calm attitude, but the Nancy and other fortress areas—extending from the Swiss border to Luxembourg—have built very solid steel defense positions or concrete fortifications. Those places are distributed with French guards, carrying guns and ammunition, staring at the actions of the other party, and constantly reviewing and practicing, as if the enemy is coming. Although France does not have to send troops to the left bank of the Rhine, it is at least a little nervous about Germany and is doing its best to guard against Germany. Since the League of Nations decided to return the Saar to Germany, there has been a huge economic change in the Saar region, starting with the food hoarding movement. The market price of meat has also risen sharply. Other daily necessities, such as wool and cotton fabrics, canned goods, and kerosene, are all at high prices. These things will soon be as expensive as on the German border, rising by an average of 40 to 50 percent because the Saar did not levy such heavy taxes before. After being returned to Germany, they must pay the same tax rate as Germany. For example, American cigarettes such as "Lucky" and "Chesterfield" could be bought for only three francs in the Saar, but they cost six and six francs in France, and thirty francs in Germany when converted into francs. After returning to Germany, the general cost of living will naturally increase.</p>
<p>Before 1929, the Saar also had unemployment problems. At that time, the monthly average was only more than 3,870 people. Now it is different. At the beginning of January this year, there were 33,594 people receiving unemployment insurance. In the past, Saar coal miners could transfer to France, but now the number of unemployed people in France has also exceeded 400,000, and the Saar has become German territory again. France will further restrict Saar workers from crossing the border, and the Saar's unemployed workers will naturally become more and more difficult.</p>
<p>The Saar is a place that produces coal, with an annual output of 12 million tons. In the past, about 40% was sold to France, 40% was consumed by the Saar itself, 8% was sold to Germany, and the rest was exported to other countries. In the next five years, France will need 2.2 million tons of Saar coal every year. If it does not increase its purchases, the Saar's only industry will experience operational difficulties.

<h3 id="e71">Liaoji: Volunteer Army's Resistance Against the Enemy Approaches Crisis <a href="#e71" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c71" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">71</a></h3>
<p>Puppet County Magistrate of Tonghua Shot and Killed by Volunteer Army; Volunteer Army Leader of Dongfeng County Arrested; Acheng County Under Heavy Siege by Volunteer Army</p>
<p>Shenyang correspondence: Since the spring thaw, the volunteer army in Liaoning and Jilin has been unusually active. The details are as follows: (1) On the 15th of this month, more than 300 volunteer soldiers suddenly appeared near Liuhe County in Liaoning Province. The puppet county magistrate of Tonghua County happened to pass by and was captured by the volunteer army. Later, the puppet police search team discovered near Xiaowudaojiang that the puppet county magistrate had been shot and killed. The search team transported the body of the puppet county magistrate to Tonghua on the morning of the 16th. (2) The second district of Haicheng County is connected to Xiugai Kunlian, so the volunteer army in the triangular area often passes through the area. On the 13th of this month, it was suddenly occupied by a hundred volunteer soldiers, and a fierce battle broke out with the puppet police in the area, killing several policemen. The volunteer army then advanced towards the jurisdiction of Gai County. (3) Ren Haishan, Yao Mingshan, Yu Shaowen, and other leaders of the volunteer army who have been most active in Dongfeng County for several years, were recently betrayed by traitors in the sixth district of Yangmulinzi in the county. The puppet police secretly deployed detectives. As a result, the volunteer army leaders were arrested and will soon be brutally murdered. They resisted the enemy for several years and were tragically sacrificed, which is extremely regrettable. (4) Since Xie Wendong, the commander-in-chief of the Ji-Eastern Anti-Japanese People's Army, occupied Fangzheng County, the Ji-Eastern volunteer army has suddenly become active. At the same time, Erdaohezi Station was also captured by the volunteer army, and it is now extremely chaotic. The volunteer army is all over the suburbs of Acheng County, and its power is very strong. The county seat is in imminent danger. A certain unit of the volunteer army also intends to attack Shuangcheng County and sent a letter to the Acheng County Office requesting passage. If they do not agree, they will lead their troops to attack the city. The county is currently firmly closed and is sending urgent telegrams to the Japanese army for assistance. The market is chaotic, people's hearts are shaken, and many shops are closed. (Northeast News Agency)</p>

<p>— Special Correspondent of This Newspaper, Geng Ya</p>
<p>Promising Prospects for Animal Husbandry in Gansu</p>
<p>Xie Biwen, the magistrate of Anxi County, hired workers to build the Confucian Temple in preparation for a primary school site. Due to the county's financial difficulties, half of the required materials were donated by the people. At the same time, the county government also sent workers to build the Anxi Airport on the Mud New Route. The project is quite large, and the people are working hard to do it. The person in charge of the airport is a German named Bao Ke. Because he likes hunting, he rarely goes to the airport to guide. The workers have no experience in this area, especially the farmers who come from two or three stations away. They are hungry and cold and eager to complete the work. They often fill the depressions too high and are ordered to dig them down again, which wastes a lot of the people's energy. It is said that Magistrate Xie is also planning to build a new primary school site and jointly plan a junior high school outside the pass with Dunyu counties. This matter is originally an important plan for cultural development. The rural economy outside the pass is already on the verge of collapse, and the existing primary schools are struggling to maintain themselves.</p>
<p>Regarding the shooting case in Xingxing Gorge that was heard on the way to Xinjiang, the Anxi garrison has captured three bandits, and one leader has escaped. After interrogation, it was learned that the bandits were all from Linxia, Gansu. The county was the ancient seat of Qinghe Prefecture, Bao'an, and was garrisoned by a general. Han and Hui people live together, and the people are known for their strength and courage. In particular, Datong Township is the source of repeated rebellions. The land in Hongtu Mountain in the township is barren and difficult to cultivate. The residents have difficulty making a living, so they first take risks, and then it becomes a common practice. The bandits' attire is like that of wealthy merchants. When they encounter travelers, they pretend to be friendly and kill them unexpectedly. If they are arrested by the government, they have often agreed in advance that someone will be responsible for a certain crime, and that person will step forward and admit it, without implicating others. If the government's trial is not appropriate, it is feared that it will lead to a major change. Past precedents are numerous, and even now there is a children's rhyme that says, "It is hateful that the people of Dongxiang have rebellious hearts from generation to generation. They are treacherous and deceitful and harm the people of the entire county." The people of Long often say that the fame of Datong Township in Hezhou is almost no less than that of Yangliuqing in Tianjin, but the reasons for the fame are different. Since the former Qing Dynasty, most of the county magistrates assigned to the county have been selected for their ability, which shows how difficult it is to govern. However, temporary dignitaries have emerged, which is unmatched by other counties. For example, former Gansu Chairman Ma Fuxiang, Ningxia Chairman Ma Hongbin, Qinghai Chairman Ma Qi, Xinjiang Chairman Jin</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>Shuren, and the current Ning Chairman Ma Hongkui and Qing Chairman Ma Lin, are all from Linxia. To have six provincial chairmen from one county is rare in the country. In addition, the military officers of all levels in the two provinces of Ning and Qing, and the garrison in Hexi, Gansu, are mostly from Linxia, accounting for 70 to 80 percent. It is said that people in Liling County, Hunan Province, obtained more than 2,000 belts for military merits after the Northern Expedition. It is estimated that Linxia's belts can be comparable.</p>
<p>Lanzhou ice pears and Guanzhong cantaloupe are famous winter fruits. Eating them can relieve coal poisoning. Ice pears are small and easy to eat, while ice melons are large and firm, heavy as stone mortars. When you use force to cut them open, the core is all ice, bright as pearls and jade, which is very beautiful. When you chew them, they make a sound like broken jade, which is more interesting than eating ice cream. It is a pity that there are no such delicacies in summer. Returning east by car from Anxi, the rivers passed by have frozen solid. The wheels travel on them as if on flat ground. Sometimes the ice cracks and the wheels sink, and rescue is very difficult. Also, when the wheel axle touches water, it freezes and cannot turn as soon as it is blown by a cold wind. It can only be driven after being burned with coal gas. In winter, the ground springs in the villages in the Anxi South Mountains freeze, and the ground and houses are raised high. After the spring thaw, the frozen ground suddenly collapses, which is easy to be shaken down. The extreme cold outside the Great Wall is so great.</p>
<p>When the garrisons outside the Great Wall change defenses, the towns and cities they pass through all hang red cloth high to show welcome. I once asked a shopkeeper, "Why don't you write words on it?" He replied, "Today is the farewell committee, and tomorrow is the welcome army. If we write them all down, where will we get so much cloth?" Although this is the economics of people changing due to poverty, it can also be seen that there is a grand scene of officials coming and going in the remote border areas. When I stayed at his store, I saw "donation flyers" pasted on the wall, as numerous as snowflakes. It was the temporary fee for the whole village to welcome the army that day. Each household was assigned a certain amount of money, and the "donation flyers" had also been sent. They were newly pasted on the wall. In addition, the "donation flyers" for grain taxes and corvée are too numerous to count, especially the "assign a sheepskin," "assign ten pounds of camel hair," and "assign a student" flyers, which are rare in other places. Then I asked, "What will happen if those who are assigned are unable to pay?" He replied, "Then it is inevitable that the county police will whip and bind them. There is a song in the village that says, 'The county police go to the countryside, as vicious as tigers. Give them ▢▢ ▢, they want sheep, sleep on a hot kang, and also want a wife. If they are not satisfied, they will be tied up and whipped'—these are all true. As for sheepskins, camel hair, opium, etc., they are all transferred to the army. Students are assigned because they cannot afford to study." Hearing this, one can imagine the harshness of miscellaneous taxes.</p>
<p>The annual output of Yumen Shishan is 40,000 to 50,000 catties, and each 100 catties is worth more than three yuan. The mine owner has six shares, including four full shares and four half shares, for a total of eight families. The annual sales of cash or exchanges for cloth are divided equally according to the six shares. The capital of each share was 400 strings of cash when it was opened during the Qing Tongzhi period. By the eighteenth year of the Republic of China, someone had mortgaged half a share for 600 yuan, which shows that the profit was not small. The oil is purely made by local methods. The oil springs emerge from the ground. They are scooped up and placed in wooden barrels. Holes are drilled in the bottom of the barrels. Due to the specific gravity, the spring water leaks down, and then you get the rock oil. The composition of the oil is excellent for chemical experiments. It is said that the government once planned to use new methods for mining, but it has not yet been realized.</p>
<p>Gansu was the land of six counties in ancient times, with fertile fields for thousands of miles, lush water and grass, and animal husbandry was known to the world. For example, West Lake in Anxi, Tuchengzi in Yumen, Daxiaohonggou in Shiyansi, as well as Yemachuan in Zhangye, Shouyang Mountain in Longxi, Maxian Mountain in Lintao, Mawu in Minxian, Zhuoni in Lintan, Chengmali in Zhangxian, Chiuniu Slope in Nanshan, Guanshan in Longde, Northeast Township in Qingyang, Bailaozi in Guyuan, Qingshuizui, Sujiabao, Qingshui Ditch, Malian in Wenxian, Wangtang Erba, Cao Mei Mountain, Xiadan Fort, etc., are all natural large pastures with lush water and grass. During the Qing Guangxu period, eight major horse farms were opened in Caohu, Jiuquan, and each ranch in Gansu and Liang had as many as three or four thousand horses. After the Republic of China, the horses in Ganzhou still belonged to the government's pastures. In the twelfth year, a branch factory was established in Haiyuan, and more than 600 horses were distributed from Gansu. The Maxian Mountain in Lintao also established a horse ranch at the same time. The breeding and reproduction of each factory was robust, and the results were remarkable. Later, affected by the war, the factories were abandoned one after another, and the official property was sold at a uniform price. Animal husbandry is only a sideline of farming, and it is not easy to see herds of hundreds or thousands of horses, cattle, sheep, and camels in various places. It is clear that it is declining day by day. Now, the committee has sent personnel to investigate animal husbandry in Gansu and Qinghai, and is also establishing a Gansu-Qinghai livestock improvement experimental farm. They will first select breeds of cattle and sheep, and study the source of diseases. It is hoped that the association will be able to promote it effectively and universally revitalize animal husbandry in various places, so that the lush water and grass and rich resources of Gansu Province will not be abandoned like a wasteland for a long time.</p>
<h3 id="e73">Tianjin Yarn Industry Bankrupts: All Affected by Dumping of Japanese Yarn <a href="#e73" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c73" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">73</a></h3>
<p>Tianjin Correspondence: The Tianjin yarn spinning industry has been affected by the dumping of Japanese yarn and the high price of cotton and low price of yarn. During the past year, it has been struggling in hardship every day. The decline in business is more than the year before. There are six factories in the city: Yuyuan, Yuda, Huaxin, Baocheng, Beiyang, and Shenyuan. Yuda is operated by the Japanese on behalf of their creditors and is actually a Japanese-owned factory. Its business relies on special relationships and is beyond the reach of the general public. Baocheng Hengyuan stopped work one after another last autumn due to deficits. The workers were laid off. Only three factories, Yuyuan, Huaxin, and Beiyang, continued to produce finished products and did not stop work. Before the past year, Beiyang was reorganized into Xinji Company due to debts and taken over by someone else. Yuyuan has accumulated more than 5 million in arrears over the years, and its debts exceed the total amount of assets. The Japanese creditors even proposed to manage the factory and collect debts. So, it also implemented a shutdown in the name of liquidation. Therefore, among the six major yarn factories in Tianjin, excluding Yuda, which is operated by the Japanese, only Huaxin is fully operational. Beiyang's real estate industry is not optimistic. Fixed assets, including land, buildings, machinery, furniture, and parts, are estimated at 9,039,000 yuan according to the book. After deducting depreciation of 1,872,000 yuan over the years, the book value is 7,166,000 yuan. However, after detailed estimation by various accountants, the value is no more than 5 million yuan. Over the past ten years, the factory has owed a total of 5,176,000 yuan in Chinese, Japanese, and foreign debts, and some unsettled interest is not included. Last year, the factory reduced its work efficiency due to sluggish yarn sales, only operating at 70% capacity, producing an average of 5,000 bales of yarn per day, including various coarse and fine yarns. The average selling price of each bale of yarn was 192 yuan, including labor and materials, but it lost about 10 yuan. The more it produced, the more it lost. If the factory shuts down, the creditors will rush in, the workers will lose their jobs, and the severance pay and meal expenses will be endless. As a result, the factory suffers even greater losses, so it has to grit its teeth and continue to operate. However, it stopped work before the past year and originally planned to resume work last month. Later, the shareholders held repeated meetings to discuss that with so much debt, if it is not liquidated and continues to operate in a lifeless manner, the difference between capital and debt will become greater and greater in the future, making it more difficult to repay. If it is forced to resume work now, it must raise another 1.5 million in cash, with 500,000 to first repay part of the debt, 500,000 to reorganize the machinery, and 500,000 as working capital. The shareholders do not agree to increase capital, so it was decided to lay off the workers first and elect five shareholders as liquidation committee members to carry out the liquidation first, and then discuss whether to resume work. It is estimated that the liquidation will take time and cannot be completed in a short period of time. It is not known whether the factory will shut down permanently. The Beiyang Yarn Factory originally had 30,000 spindles and 2,000 workers. Last year, due to poor business, it reduced its scope, producing only 2,000 bales per day. Before the past year, it was reorganized due to losses and was taken over by Xinji Company. The old company owed a foreign firm in Tianjin 8,000 taels, which Xinji Company was responsible for repaying. Both parties agreed to repay 1,000 taels first, and the remaining 7,000 taels after the Spring Festival. Unexpectedly, after Xinji Company took over, the recession continued, and it was unable to repay the debt on time. The foreign firm applied to the court and impounded all the furniture, machinery, and factory doors of the factory a few days ago. Later, all the workers, seeing that they had lost their jobs, petitioned the Social Bureau and the Party Department separately. After negotiations between the two agencies, only the furniture was impounded, and the factory was urged to allocate funds to repay the debt as soon as possible. Fortunately, the factory was barely able to resume work. At a time when bad news about Chinese yarn factories is frequently reported, it is said that Mitsui &amp; Co., a Japanese trading company, plans to build a large-scale yarn factory in Balitai, Tianjin South, to replace Yuyuan and Beiyang. The matter is in the planning stage. If it is realized, the lifeline of the North China yarn industry will be entirely in the hands of foreigners. (21st)</p>

<p>—Returning to Penglai to Sweep the Tomb—</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Yu Xuezhong, Chairman of the Hebei Provincial Government, arrived in Ji'nan on the evening of the 20th of this month and arrived in Qingdao by special train on the Jiaoji Railway at 7:40 this morning (24th). Those who welcomed him at the station included Mayor Shen Honglie and various bureau chiefs. After Mr. Yu got off the train, he shook hands with the welcoming personnel to express his gratitude and then took a car to the Yingbin Hotel to stay. Shen Honglie scheduled a banquet that evening to welcome Mr. Yu. According to Mr. Yu's remarks in the train, he has been traveling south for more than a month, separately visiting Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, etc., with extremely satisfactory results. He visited political constructions in Hangzhou, Shanghai, Nanjing and other places, which have made great progress compared with the past, and can be used as a reference. However, the Yangtze River basin has been affected by natural disasters and man-made calamities in recent years, and the bankruptcy of the rural areas is very worrying. The plugging of the Yellow River's breach has been agreed upon with the central government and should be repaired urgently to turn danger into safety. The war zone issue has been largely resolved and should not happen again unexpectedly. My ancestral home is in Shandong, so I took the opportunity to return home. When I was in Ji'nan, I was insisted on staying by Chairman Han for three days. Since Mayor Shen's arrival in Qingdao, the achievements in various political constructions have been rapid. Those who travel to Qingdao praised extremely. I took a detour to Qingdao to visit and see Mayor Shen and my friends. I will stay in Qingdao for two or three days, and then return to my ancestral home in Penglai, because I have been away from home for many years and have long wanted to visit the graves of my ancestors, etc. (24th)</p>
<h3 id="e75">Hunan Drought Relief Association Borrows Money from the Banking Sector <a href="#e75" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c75" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">75</a></h3>
<p>The Loan Amount is 2 Million Yuan; The Purpose is to Handle Disaster Relief</p>
<p>Changsha Correspondence: Hunan suffered a severe drought last year. Among the 70 counties in the province, the disaster-stricken area reached as many as 64 counties. There are more than 10 million disaster victims to be relieved. The Hunan Provincial Drought Relief Committee was established last year, running around and appealing for relief both inside and outside the province. As a result, only more than 600,000 yuan was raised, which has long been spent. As the spring plowing is approaching, in the disaster-stricken areas, not only has the rice price risen to 20 to 30 yuan per stone, but there is money but no market, and there are no seeds available for spring plowing, especially in the areas above Yuanling in western Hunan and above Hengzhou in southern Hunan. He Jian, Chairman of the Provincial Government, has transported the provincial bank's stored grain, the flood relief association's work loan stored grain, and the provincial warehouse's grain, totaling about 500,000 to 600,000 stones, to equalize the price, but it is just a drop in the bucket and does not help. The Drought Relief Committee members discussed again and again and decided to use the rice and salt public shares or the public assets and state-run businesses of the entire province as collateral to borrow 2 million yuan from the Changsha banking sector to rush to handle agricultural loans. If the banking sector refuses to borrow money, it will ask the banking sector to raise funds on its own to handle agricultural loans or transport grain to the disaster areas to equalize the price. This matter has been approved by the provincial government and is scheduled to be discussed with the heads of various banks at the Drought Relief Association on the 24th of this month. The proposed measures have been sent to the heads of various banks. The letter stated, "Respected Sir, Xiang Province encountered a rare drought last year. The extent of the disaster-stricken area and the severity of the disaster situation are unprecedented. Although this association has appealed in many ways, the central and local governments, as well as various provinces and ports, all feel financially difficult, or replied that they are unable to help, or used the excuse of delaying the fundraising and remittance. Therefore, after half a year of handling, the outside of the province only obtained 150,000 yuan from the Shanghai fundraising of various provinces' drought relief charity associations, 1,800 yuan from the Qingdao Two Lakes Fellow Villagers Association, and 1,600 yuan from Committee Member Xu Dong Fan. Other rice and salt public shares, disaster relief public bonds, and disaster relief tariffs have been repeatedly sent representatives to Beijing to negotiate, but they have not been realized. Within the province, only the Provincial Relief Association has allocated 250,000 yuan from the salt tax surcharge successively, and the Flood Relief Aftermath Committee has allocated 100,580 yuan from the existing emergency relief funds. The provincial government has advanced 50,000 yuan from the salary deductions of various agencies to help relief, and this association has sent a letter requesting a further allocation of 50,000 yuan to be distributed for emergency relief. The total amount of funds raised is only 609,200 yuan, which has been successively distributed for winter crop seeds and spring relief, and has been completely distributed. However, it is just a drop in the bucket, and the remedy is still not much. The resources are exhausted, and fundraising is truly lacking. As the spring plowing is approaching, and there is a shortage of both money and grain, it is a great disaster for millions of disaster victims. I believe that managing the distribution of relief funds is originally a legitimate business of the banking sector, and that lending money to help disaster relief is something that you, dear presidents, have always agreed with. In addition to sending separate letters, we have prepared several points of measures and sent them for your consideration and handling. We have also scheduled a luncheon on the 24th of this month, and we hope that you will come to the meeting to discuss everything. The attached measures are as follows: (1) Use the 7,445,000 yuan owed by the Ministry of Railways to Xiang Province as a guarantee for rice and salt public shares to borrow 2 million yuan from various banks in Changsha City, with a monthly interest rate of 8%, and the repayment period is half by the end of 1935 and the principal and interest will be fully paid by the end of 1936. The borrowed money will be distributed by this association to various disaster areas for agricultural loans, and the loan methods will be determined separately. (2) Use provincial public assets or state-run businesses as collateral to borrow 2 million yuan from the Changsha banking sector. The interest rate and repayment period, as well as the relief plan, are the same as the above item. (3) The Changsha banking sector will gather a fund of 2 million yuan and imitate the methods of the Hunan China Foreign Relief Association to independently handle agricultural loans in various disaster areas, but the monthly interest rate should not exceed 1%. The repayment period is half by the end of 1935 and the principal and interest will be fully paid by the end of 1936. (4) The Changsha banks will gather funds and freely transport grain to various disaster areas in need for sale to help the people's food." (December 22nd)</p>

<p>Ma Hanzhang, the Fourth District Training Commissioner of the Provincial Security Office, concurrently served as the director of the Security Corps Platoon Leader Training Institute. He was in his fifties and usually had a strong physique. Unexpectedly, at about 3:00 am the day before yesterday (20th), he suddenly felt abdominal pain and sweating profusely. He got out of bed to go to the toilet. Before long, his complexion turned pale, and he lost consciousness. Without medical treatment, he died of illness in his private residence. Subsequently, the county government telegraphed the situation to the Provincial Security Office and received a telegram in reply, appointing Xie Bangyan, a lieutenant colonel staff officer of this office, to succeed the vacancy. After receiving the order, Xie arrived in Songjiang on the 23rd to take over the work.</p>

<p>The disaster refugees' shelter run by the Songjiang Branch of the Red Cross Society accommodates as many as 5,000 refugees, requiring more than sixteen stones of rice porridge per day, which are maintained by the chairman of the board, Zhou Xuewen, and others. As the spring plowing season is approaching, more than a thousand refugees from the territory of Jiading County were transported back to their hometowns for farming in the first batch the day before yesterday. The refugees from Jiaxing and Tongxiang counties who are still staying in the shelter urgently need to be transported continuously. Yesterday, the Jiaxing County Magistrate came to Songjiang to visit and discussed the transportation methods with the directors. It will still be requested that the railway bureau provide free transportation. After the batch of refugees is sent away, part of the shelter will be closed.</p>

<p>The local products exhibition in this county, which is organized by the Local Chinese Products Business Office, officially opened on the 23rd. Thousands of people from various agencies and all walks of life attended. For a time, there was heavy traffic on Songhui Road, and people rubbed shoulders with each other. The business of various manufacturers was very crowded. Some manufacturers even telegraphed their factories to continue to send goods to meet the sales demand, which proves that the people of the county are happy to use domestic products, and the organizers have enthusiastically promoted them. The association rents the original site of the Gongji Amusement Park, which has a spacious location and can accommodate 10,000 people. There are still some booths available. There are still several manufacturers in Shanghai Hankou Road Tongan Building Office who are contacting to join, and they will come to Songjiang to arrange soon.</p>

The county government has issued a reward. Anyone who can catch an escaped prisoner will be rewarded with 20 yuan. Yesterday, Xia Ziyun, an escaped prisoner who was originally sentenced to life imprisonment, was caught and sent to the county government. According to his confession, it was Xia Daxia, a well-known bandit from Jiangbei with a pockmarked face, who initiated and instigated the escape. According to the confession, the county government has transferred the case to the prosecutor's office of the court for investigation and custody. Li Shuzhang, the county jail officer in charge of the prison, has been ordered to be dismissed by the High Court and ordered to be investigated by the county jailer. Zheng Daquan has been appointed to succeed him and will come to Songjiang to take over the work soon.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Wuxi Cantonese Tourist Opens Fire Causing Trouble <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>On the 19th of the lunar month of February, the Jinghui Temple in Zhuangqiao Township, the Third District, had a grand festival as usual, which was very lively. Therefore, tens of thousands of people from the surrounding villages came to worship and burn incense. Among them, seven or eight Cantonese youths (living in the Weixin Model Village, which is about three miles away) also went to visit in a team. Unexpectedly, the Cantonese people had a conflict with a villager due to the crowded tourists and obstructed road. Then they twisted each other, and soon the situation expanded, and many people were involved in the whirlpool. The two sides fought each other. At that time, a Cantonese person took out a pistol from his pocket and fired a shot as a warning. Fortunately, no one was injured, but the situation became more tense, and the order was in chaos for a while. During the turmoil, the gun fell into the crowd, and the Cantonese people could not pick it up, and the shooter was beaten and injured. The pistol was picked up by Zhang Wanggao, a villager, and sent to the Sixth Observation Post of the Third District for verification. The director of the post reported it to the Sixth Brigade along with the original gun and transferred it to the county government for investigation.</p>

<p>The Xihu Highway Long-Distance Bus Company has successfully borrowed money from the bank and can open to traffic in advance in June of this year. All roads are now being rushed to build the road surface. However, the Xichang section of the road has long been completed. Because the bridge piers were built high when building the bridges, the road surface had to be raised to connect with the bridge abutments. It has been raised repeatedly before. Now, after a rain and snow fell on the day before yesterday, the roadbed has not been rolled, and there are many defects. It is planned to repair it again. On the 23rd of this month, Zhang Heji, an engineer sent by the Construction Department, came to Changshu to inspect it. He believed that there were still many depressions on the road and it was necessary to continue to build it, otherwise it would be unimaginable after the road was opened to traffic. After the inspection, Zhang went to the county government to discuss with County Magistrate Zhai the method of increasing earthwork to make it possible to complete it as soon as possible.</p>

It is said that all the main industries have been investigated clearly, and there are still several industries that are currently under investigation. The wood industry has always been the main business in the county. This year, the Lianhe River was dredged and completely stopped. Xu Juxi, the leader of the industry, specially visited Inspector Gu to request that the tax be exempted during the suspension period. Inspector Gu is expected to stay for two or three more days before transferring to other counties for review.</p>

<p>Qiu Asheng, a 41-year-old bamboo worker who works north of Xueqiao Bridge on Nandajie Street in this city, has a mentally ill brother, Afu, and a younger brother, Alian, who both died of illness two years ago. Recently, due to poor business and financial difficulties, he owed a lot of money for cigarettes in the Yuelai grocery store across the street and could not pay it back for a while. At about 5:00 pm on the 23rd, he went to Yuelai again to ask for cigarettes on credit. Yuelai refused to give him credit again because the previous debts had not been paid. Asheng felt ashamed, and others humiliated him. Asheng was ashamed and angry, and went home to get his usual chopper and cut his throat to commit suicide. Suddenly, blood splattered everywhere, and he lost consciousness. People rushed to help him to Cunren Hospital for treatment. Because his esophagus was broken, he died at 7:00 pm.</p>

As for the civil lawsuit, the branch has issued summons to a group of witnesses to open the trial twice, but it has not yet been concluded. It is now scheduled to be tried again on April 24. Because Wu Heshu is still at large and his address is unknown, he has been served by public announcement, hoping that the defendant will report to the court for trial at that time.</p>

<p>Wang Faxiang, the squad leader of the Third Shed of the Sixteenth Detachment of the Second District of Liangzhe Salt Affairs stationed in the city, and Tax Police Pan Caiyuan intercepted Xia A Jin, a villager from Xiajiayaodi Township in the southern township, on the Dahuilu of Lichun on the morning of the 19th, taking away six yuan in silver. It happened to be seen by the county magistrate and others, and after hearing the news from more than 200 fellow villagers and farmers who were trading in the market and building roads outside the city, they petitioned the county government to severely punish them. The county government then summoned and detained the tax police squad leader for interrogation and detention in the afternoon and telegraphed to the Zhejiang Security Office to send them directly to Hangzhou. In the morning of the 20th, it ordered six soldiers to escort them onto a speedboat. Unexpectedly, the Third Shed of the Sixteenth Detachment suddenly gathered more than a dozen tax police from various defense areas and chased after them with weapons. The speedboat was caught up at Dabanqiao, 25 miles away from the county seat. They suddenly opened fire to show their strength and stabbed the boat tracker Liu Xiaomu in the wrist. Then they seized the offending squad leader Wang Faxiang and Tax Police Pan Caiyuan from the boat. The county government escort soldiers did not resist. At that time, the Lianghu Task Force stationed in the area received an order from the county government to protect them. The two sides confronted each other, and the situation was very tense. The tax police were tough and claimed that they each had their own superiors and the county government had no jurisdiction. Wang and Pan must be sent to our superior team today, otherwise we can only open fire. The task force was afraid of causing chaos in the area, so it monitored the escorted prisoners and accompanied them to the Baiguan team headquarters. They argued for a long time without a decision. Both sides were ready to fight. Fortunately, Zhao, the director of the Ningbo Security Branch, received a long-distance call from the county magistrate and sent someone to take away the robbers, and the incident did not occur.</p>

Unexpectedly, Chief Inspector Sun Junmou was very dissatisfied with the newspaper. Yesterday, Wang Yunkang, a reporter from the newspaper, went to the County Public Security Bureau to inquire about news. Sun ordered the police to detain Wang in the reception room and insulted him arbitrarily for an hour. Later, Director Dai learned about it and released him. When reporters from various newspapers heard the news, they believed that Sun had abused his power and insulted the reporter, which was illegal. They jointly petitioned County Magistrate Chen to investigate and severely punish him.</p>

<h3 id="e94">Opinions on the View of Spoken Drama in Mr. Wang Bosheng's "Opinions on Theater Facilities" <a href="#e94" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c94" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">94</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Daofan</p>
<p>Mr. Wang Bosheng recently wrote an "Opinion on Theater Facilities", which was published in the Central Daily News in early this month. There are indeed many commendable opinions in this opinion, but unfortunately, his view on spoken drama is inevitably too rash! Therefore, it has aroused great resentment from people who are working hard on spoken drama!</p>
<p>In the past ten days or so, I have received letters from five or six friends in Peiping and Shanghai (including Mr. Su Tang Huaiqiu and Luo Muhua), and I have also met many people in Nanjing who are working hard on spoken drama. They all expressed indignation at Mr. Wang's view of wiping out spoken drama and thinking that this road is impassable. They all said that they would write articles to refute it. Yesterday, I saw the supplement of the North China Daily and learned that Mr. Luo Muhua has publicly solicited opinions from readers on this matter. Mr. Sun Dezhong also published an article "On Spoken Drama and Peking Opera" in the Central Daily News. If it is not handled well, it will cause another war of words.</p>
<p>In fact, this matter is not worth the efforts of people who are working hard on spoken drama to oppose so vigorously. Mr. Wang Bosheng's view on spoken drama is inevitably a bit excessive. However, it is not surprising that Mr. Wang, who only knows how to work hard on new operas, made this view! This is just as unsurprising as some friends who work hard on spoken drama despise old operas as worthless!</p>
<p>"Spoken drama is art", I don't think it should be a problem. If this matter is still a problem in China in this era, wouldn't the Japanese laugh to death! How can the value of spoken drama art be wiped out by Mr. Wang's "Where is its artistic component?" a question? Some people's opinions are often subject to change. When Wang Guangsheng worked hard on spoken drama in those years, he also regarded spoken drama as art. When he felt that this road was impassable and worked hard on old operas, and later discovered that old operas needed to be improved and worked hard on new operas, he not only doubted that spoken drama was art. I am afraid that he also doubts old operas that are not new operas. Is this because Mr. Wang's belief in spoken drama is not firm and his research is not deep? Or is it that the art of spoken drama has fundamentally shaken? It is worth our careful study. How can people who pay attention to spoken drama doubt that spoken drama is art because of Mr. Wang's uncertain words?</p>
<p>In the eyes of Mr. Wang, who is working hard on new opera, of course, "New opera has a foundation", and the performance of spoken drama will have a new trend. Film art can get a new development. But in the eyes of people who are dedicated to spoken drama, it may be the opposite of Mr. Wang. Because when we look at the stage when spoken drama and film developed in the past, no country's spoken drama and film had a new trend of development because they had opera as a foundation. Even if Mr. Wang's words are correct, the foundation of the new opera is not yet determined when it will be built. If it cannot be built in twenty years, how can people who work hard on spoken drama "wait for the hare by the stump" and wait until twenty years later to borrow the foundation of the new opera to seek a new trend for spoken drama and a new development for film.</p>
<p>Mr. Wang feels that spoken drama is "Looking for another way out in the direction that this road is impassable." This is of course limited to Mr. Wang himself, or what Mr. Wang calls "us". Whether the road of spoken drama is passable or not, how can it be decided by Mr. Wang's understatement? How can people who work hard on spoken drama think that this road is impassable just because Mr. Wang thinks that "this road is impassable"? If so, it is too lacking in self-confidence. As for whether the new opera is sure to be passable? Or where will it lead to? It is difficult to predict at this moment. It all depends on the results of Mr. Wang's efforts in the future to determine. If the road of new opera is impassable again, Mr. Wang will of course find another way out. At that time, who knows that Mr. Wang's view on new opera will not be the same as today's view on spoken drama?</p>
<p>My opinion on this matter is just like this. What I hope most is: People who believe that "Spoken drama is art", believe that "The road of spoken drama is passable", believe that "The performance of spoken drama does not necessarily require a new opera to have a foundation to have a new trend", and believe that "Film art does not necessarily require a new opera to have a foundation to get a new development." should bury their heads, muster their courage, and move forward steadily. In the future, show the country the actual results. At that time, all the theories about spoken drama that are similar to Chu and not Chu can be defeated without attacking.</p>
<p>I also hope that Mr. Wang and Mr. Wang's "us" will be loyal and work hard for the early success of the new opera. There is no need to challenge all parties with unnecessary theories. If people who work hard on spoken drama do not work hard in practice, but only tout themselves by opposing old operas. Then we cannot call it boring to say that people who work hard on new opera and those who engage in old opera specialize in disparaging spoken drama to raise their own status! We should believe that: "Pointing out other people's shortcomings does not necessarily make your own strengths apparent"! Even if it can, this method cannot be considered clever. If everyone is already filled with miasma when the shadow of this new opera has not yet appeared and spoken drama has not yet fully developed. Then spoken drama will unfortunately be like what Mr. Wang said, it cannot be imitated in Europe and the United States in a hundred years. I am afraid that the new opera will never have a day when it will be superior to the Japanese. What is there to brag about? Do you really want to make the Japanese laugh to death?</p>

<h3 id="e95">Sun Ke Returns from Touring Zhejiang Province's Scenic Spots <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>According to reports, Legislative Yuan President Sun Ke, accompanied by Vice Minister of Industry Liu Weichi and Legislative Yuan member Liang Hancao, traveled from Nanjing to Hangzhou on the 18th, and then toured the scenic spots around Wenzhou's Yandang Mountain. They returned to Shanghai from Hangzhou at 11 PM on the 23rd. In addition to sightseeing, Sun also inspected the highways in Zhejiang Province along the way, deeming the construction to be excellent. Due to the fatigue of the journey, he will stay in Shanghai for a few days before heading to Nanjing to attend the Legislative Yuan's regular meeting on the 29th. Sun met with reporters from various newspapers at his private residence on Columbia Road at 10 AM yesterday and made the following remarks:</p>
<p>European Situation</p>
<p>Reporters asked Sun about the international concern caused by Germany's recent rearmament, which has made countries such as Britain, France, and Italy uneasy. Sun stated that it is a natural trend for Britain, France, Italy, and other countries to feel that Germany's rearmament has caused tension in Europe. However, he does not expect a European war to break out immediately as a result. If it were to lead to a second world war, it would inevitably affect the entire world, as international relations are currently very close, and China would naturally be affected as well.</p>
<p>Eastern Road Incident</p>
<p>Regarding the Soviet Union's transfer of the Chinese Eastern Railway, China has already issued a statement that the contract for the transfer has been signed, resulting in a significant loss of China's rights and interests. It is not yet known whether the government will submit this action by the Soviet Union, which disregards China's rights and interests, to the League of Nations for discussion.</p>
<p>Financial Public Bonds</p>
<p>In order to alleviate the decline of domestic industry and commerce, the Ministry of Finance plans to issue 100 million yuan in financial public bonds for the 24th year of the Republic. This has been decided by the Central Political Council and submitted to the Legislative Yuan for review. The Legislative Yuan will propose the bond regulations for discussion at the regular meeting on the 29th, and Sun Ke has decided to attend the meeting in Nanjing beforehand. As for the drafting of the Legislative Yuan's bankruptcy law, it has already begun, and it is expected that opinions from all sectors will be solicited at the beginning of next month to avoid the drawbacks of "building a cart behind closed doors." Laws and regulations such as the labor law have also been initiated. To understand the actual conditions of labor in various regions, it has been decided to send personnel to conduct on-site inspections of various labor areas before drafting the laws.</p>

<p>Yesterday, various shipping companies in Shanghai received a telegram from the Hong Kong Customs, stating that the Haiho ship (Haiho, transliteration) sank the day before yesterday after hitting a reef at 25.42 degrees North latitude and 119.42 degrees East longitude. The location is on a major shipping route, so the Customs sent a telegram to broadcast to all ships at sea and to various shipping companies, informing ship owners who have not yet left port to pay special attention when passing through the area to avoid danger.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Arts and Antiquities Exhibition to Be Completed by the End of the Month; Tang Xifen Discusses Preparations for Shipping to England <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>According to the Central News Agency, the pre-exhibition of the London Exhibition of Chinese Art has been actively reviewed and selected by the Preparatory Committee, and most of the work has now been completed. Since a few days ago, the display of porcelain and other antiques has begun successively. A Central News Agency reporter met with the secretary of the committee, Tang Xifen, yesterday. According to him, the four British committee members still visit the exhibition to view the antiques every day. The evaluation of jade and silk tapestries has been completed, and they are now reviewing books and calligraphy. The initial intention of this exhibition of antiques was to collect a wide range of items, so the display cabinets were increased from 64 to 92. However, due to stricter selection criteria recently, many of the more valuable items have been deselected, so the antiques on display are not as numerous as initially hoped, and the display cabinets are somewhat excessive. They are now accelerating the display, which can be completed before the 31st. Protection and fire prevention measures at the venue are in place, especially regarding fire safety. Chemical fire extinguishers, water buckets, fire hydrants, and fire alarm telephones are all installed in appropriate locations. It is rumored that the British warship Suffolk will be used to transport the antiques, but this has not yet been decided. Generally, the storage hold of a warship is not as well-suited as that of a merchant ship. Therefore, when the Suffolk arrives in Shanghai, the committee will send personnel to board the ship for inspection. If it is not suitable, merchant ships will still be used for transportation. The price of admission tickets after the opening has not yet been determined, but the exhibition hours have been set from 9:00 AM to 4:30 PM. Tickets will no longer be sold after 4:30 PM, but those in the venue can view the exhibits until 6:00 PM. From 6:00 PM to 8:00 PM, the venue will be cleaned. As for the shipment of antiques to England, tenders have been invited for the manufacture of iron boxes. Dasing Factory has already sent a sample box, made of black iron sheet with brass strips and nails, locked on three sides, which is quite sturdy and beautiful. The inside bottom is equipped with springs to prevent the antiques in the box from being damaged by shocks.</p>

Therefore, it borrowed a huge amount of money from the loan department of Sassoon Yangxing in Shanghai. After consultation, both parties have agreed that the Sino-British Gengzi Indemnity will be used as collateral. The amount is stipulated as 4 million yuan in Chinese currency, with an annual interest rate of six percent. It will be repaid in ten installments from January 1, 1935, until the entire amount is paid off by 1946. The contract was signed and established last month. It is heard that Sassoon Yangxing paid the entire amount last week, and the new public bonds that the Huai River Guidance Committee planned to issue have been canceled.</p>

The association and charitable organizations jointly raised relief funds, which only amount to tens of thousands of yuan. If distributed according to the number of disaster victims, each person will receive less than one yuan. Now, the local people are demanding that the entire 4th district be handled. The association believes that it is difficult to allocate due to the lack of funds and cannot start. There is nothing that can be done. It is hoped that at this time when starving people are waiting for rescue and lives are at stake, big-hearted people at home and abroad will embrace the idea of saving people is saving oneself. At this time, being able to save one more life is the highest merit. Saving one person and reaching tens of millions of people will create unimaginable blessings. The mournful crying of the hungry people, their eyes are looking through, leaving their lives to wait.</p>

<p>Thugs Forcibly Prevent Return, Family Members Sue to the Court for Arrest</p>
<p>Farmers Yang Dengrong and Qin Qiqing from Taixing, due to rural bankruptcy and a large family, found it difficult to support themselves. Therefore, around June of the 20th year of the Republic of China, they were brought to Shanghai by a fellow villager, Mrs. Chen, one after another: Yang Dengrong's daughter Luo Ying, Qin Qiqing's daughter Su Zhen, Qin Qiliang's niece Gui'er, Qiu Hefei's niece Gai Zhen, Qiu's sister-in-law Guang Ying, Qi Henggao's daughter Ruzi, Qi Fubao's daughter Liuzi, Qi Xu's eldest daughter, Qiu Shenshan's sister Fenzi, Li Tianshou's sister Fenzi, and Wang's daughter Xiaobao, eleven girls in total (all aged between fourteen and sixteen years). They were introduced as female workers to the Huafeng and Yong'an factories, and lived and ate at Mrs. Chen's house. Unexpectedly, around January of this year, Mrs. Chen became seriously ill and unable to care for them, so she sent people to the countryside, ordering the family heads of each family to come to Shanghai quickly to take them back, so as to avoid being displaced. Upon hearing the news, Yang Dengrong and others immediately made an appointment with the family heads to come to Shanghai. Unexpectedly, upon arriving in Shanghai, Mrs. Chen had already died. Just as the family heads were preparing to take their daughters back, Zhao Guangzhi, whose original name was Zhou Chengxin, who lived in Yinghua Lane on Roberts Road, instigated female gangsters Sister Liu to lead more than ten male and female thugs to interfere and prevent them from taking the girls back. Yang Dengrong and others, seeing this, urgently tried to reason with them, but were immediately attacked and beaten by the thugs, injuring Qi Xu. Yang Dengrong and others are all simple and weak villagers, and in a foreign land with no relatives, they repeatedly negotiated to take them back, but were all unreasonably prevented. Yang and others, fearing their ferocity, did not dare to argue, and sought help everywhere. They were directed to Zhu Honglie's Law Firm, where they explained the details. Yesterday morning, Attorney Zhu wrote a complaint on their behalf, reporting to the Prosecutor's Office of the District Court, accusing the defendants Zhao Guangzhi (who is reportedly in custody in the District Court detention center for another case) and Sister Liu of obstructing freedom and violent assault, requesting that the police be ordered to quickly arrest the defendants and severely punish them according to law, and order them to hand over the daughters of the plaintiffs, so that they can be taken back and reunited, to complete the family relationship. It was also said that the defendants dared to imprison the actions of the plaintiffs' daughters and forcibly separate them from their families under the flag of the Qing Tian Bai Ri, making it impossible for the family to reunite, and dared to commit assault and injury, which was extremely illegal. It is rumored that the defendants have further plans to hide or sell the eleven daughters of the plaintiffs in separate locations. Because the plaintiffs' daughters are all young girls around the age of 20, if they are hidden, the plaintiffs will not be able to take steps to recover them, which is extremely dangerous. They beg the court to quickly conduct an investigation of the injuries and immediately order the police to go to the address and arrest them, and hand over the eleven daughters of the plaintiffs for each family to take back, to complete the family relationship and maintain the law. Furthermore, the plaintiffs have been in Shanghai for a long time and their funds have been exhausted. If the delay continues, they will starve to death in a foreign land. Therefore, they respectfully request the court to take swift action. After receiving the complaint, the court immediately convened a prosecutor to open a court, questioned each of the plaintiffs one by one, verified the wounds of Qi Xu, and dispatched police to cooperate with the plaintiffs to identify and arrest them.</p>

<p>Lu Chongpeng, a member of the former Beiyang government parliament and a wealthy businessman from Haimen, Jiangsu, resides in a foreign house at No. 24 Qingyun Lane, Laoer East Road, French Concession. The house belongs to Yuanchang Company at No. 440 Minquan Road. The monthly rent plus street sweeping fee is 55 taels. After the abolishment of taels and conversion to yuan, it is equivalent to 76 yuan, 9 jiao, and 2 fen. He has been in arrears for six months, from October of last year to this month, plus a check for 100 yuan dated January 21 of this year from the Continental Bank Xiahfei Road branch with the account name of Yao Ji, for a total of 561 yuan, 5 jiao, and 2 fen. Because the landlord repeatedly urged him to pay, he delayed in paying. For this reason, Wang Shuli, the legal representative of Yuanchang Company, filed a complaint with the Civil Court of the Special Court to recover the rent arrears and order him to vacate the house. The court, upon receiving the complaint, summoned both parties. The trial was held on the afternoon of the day before yesterday by Judge Wu Xiaoke in Civil Court 7. The defendant did not arrive, only the plaintiff was present. The official said that because the defendant had not arrived, the trial could not be held, and adjourned the court to the 27th to summon the defendant to appear for interrogation.</p>

They were all taken to the Hongkou Police Station and transferred to the women's detention center. The next morning, they were sent to the Third Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The Public Works Bureau lawyer Li Zhishan stated the previous situation and requested investigation. Subsequently, Police Officer Yin reported the details of the crackdown and presented the evidence for inspection. Judge Wu Zehan interrogated each of the defendants and made a clear confession, sentencing Ma Wang to one year of imprisonment, Chen Zhang, Zhang Bao, and Bao Ding to a fine of 40 yuan each, and the evidence was confiscated.</p>

<p>In the garden at the south end of the Hongqiao Airport in West Shanghai, at about 0:30 a.m. yesterday, two robbers dressed in yellow military uniforms, wearing yellow military caps, and speaking with a northern accent suddenly came. Each held a Mauser pistol and broke in. One robber stood guard at the door, and the other robber entered. At that time, Wang Xueju, who was watching the garden, was sleeping soundly and was awakened from his dream. The robber immediately pointed his gun at him, forcing Wang to hand over silver. Wang then gave the robbers one silver dollar and several dimes that he had on him. Unexpectedly, the robber, failing to get what he wanted, immediately fired a shot, hitting Wang in the abdomen. Wang was injured and fell to the ground, bleeding profusely. The two robbers, seeing that they had caused trouble, immediately fled. Later, the villagers heard the alarm and reported it to the Beixinjing Pusong Police Station. The director sent police officers and the detective team leader Geng Shoubao, detective Li Changfa, and others to rush to the scene, first sending the injured man to the Red Cross Hospital for treatment. It is reported that his life is in danger. Then, they inspected the scene and returned to the station to report.</p>

<p>The thief Chen Linsheng, a native of Ningbo, was arrested in the Public Concession in the spring of last year for committing a robbery case. He was sentenced to seven years of imprisonment by the First Special Court. Later, the French police found that Chen had also committed a theft in the French Concession, so they sent a detective to the First Special Court to transfer Chen to the Second Special Court and filed a public prosecution. After the trial was concluded, he was acquitted due to lack of conclusive evidence. Subsequently, an appeal was filed, and the High Third Branch conducted a trial and upheld the original judgment. During the third instance appeal period, Chen was held in the detention center of the Second Special Court, waiting to be transferred back to the First Special Court for imprisonment after the decision was finalized. Unexpectedly, after the decision was finalized in the two trials, Zhu Xifan, the clerk in charge of the High Third Branch, neglected to investigate the case file in detail and rashly reported to the judge in charge to issue a release ticket to release Chen. Chen was lucky enough to be released from prison and escaped, and disappeared without a trace. When the High Third Branch discovered this, it sent police to pursue and arrest him, but was unable to find him. Liang, the president of the High Third Branch, believed that Zhu had neglected his duties, mistakenly released the thief, and obstructed official duties, so he immediately ordered Zhu to be detained for investigation and ordered him to be released on bail pending investigation. At that time, because the case was confidential, it was not disclosed. It is now reported that the case has come to an end. In addition to issuing an arrest warrant for Chen, Liang, the president of the High Third Branch, ordered Zhu Xifan to be dismissed from his position a few days ago to show punishment.</p>

At that moment, Xu Zhi (transliteration), a soldier from the Shanghai-stationed American barracks, was driving truck No. 13, a troop carrier, speeding from west to east. Due to the driver's carelessness, Yu's rickshaw was knocked down along with him. Yu sustained head injuries and bleeding, and his left calf was also crushed. He fainted immediately. Patrol officers discovered the scene, recorded the truck number, and reported it to the French police station. They sent the injured person and rickshaw to Guangci Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died before receiving treatment. The police dispatched detectives to carry the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Hall morgue for examination. The deceased's family was not in Shanghai. Only the rickshaw owner, Su Liyi (from the same hometown as the deceased), was summoned for questioning. A request was made to the Second Special District Court to send a prosecutor to the morgue for verification. The body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall for photographing and encoffining on behalf of the family, pending their arrival to claim it. The rickshaw owner, Su Liyi, has sent a letter to the deceased's family in Taixing, urging them to come to Shanghai to claim the body immediately.</p>

<p>The large-scale heroin manufacturing facility located at No. 45, Lane 520, Bazilu Road, a four-story Western-style building, was raided at noon on the 15th of this month by Chief Inspector Lu Shukui and Detective Song Bingzheng of the Public Concession Police Headquarters. A large quantity of heroin raw materials and equipment, worth tens of thousands of dollars, was seized. The suspects, Ma Rongmei, Zhang Xiaodi, Hu Afa, and Li Abao, were arrested and taken to the Hongkou Police Station, then transferred to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention. This was previously reported in this newspaper. Further investigation revealed that the defendants were hired by a Japanese man named Koiso, who lived in the same house, as a driver, cook, carpenter, and chauffeur. Whether the ringleader of the facility is Japanese or Chinese is still under investigation. A Japanese man named Terao is highly suspected of being involved and has been detained and sent to the Japanese consulate for investigation. Another Japanese man, Tani Shibak, is at large. The other day, Judge Wu Zehan presided over a continued hearing in the Third Criminal Court.

<p>Longhua Temple in this city is a famous ancient temple in Shanghai, said to have been built during the Chiwu period. Next to the temple is a seven-story pagoda. Throughout history, incense offerings have been abundant. During the mid-Qing Dynasty, the number of monks from all directions seeking lodging at the temple reached six to seven hundred. Since the beginning of the Republic of China, it has suffered from repeated military conflicts, causing the temple to fall into disrepair and the monks to disperse. After Abbot Yuanzhao took over, he failed to uphold the monastic rules and sold temple property. The Arhat and Constellation Halls within the temple were also destroyed by fire, with broken doors and windows, in a deplorable state. Last spring, the Buddhist Association hired the Venerable Xingkong, an elder monk from Mount Emei (a former Qing Dynasty scholar), as the abbot of the temple. He renovated the temple and raised a large sum of money to rebuild the Arhat and Constellation Halls, as well as the east and west bell and drum towers, on their original sites, giving them a completely new appearance. Over the past year, more than forty to fifty thousand yuan has been spent. The temple now has more than three hundred monks, restoring it to its former glory of decades ago. Now that the spring is bright and the peach blossoms are red and the willows are green, the people of Shanghai are flocking to visit in large numbers. Yesterday was Sunday, so the number of tourists was even greater.</p>

<p>Yongfeng Cotton Yarn Store, located at No. 214 Rue de la Grande Armée, Moller Street, specializes in wholesale to various ports and also conducts retail business. It has been in operation for eight or nine years and has a thriving business. Last week, two bandits, pretending to be customers, broke into the store and robbed forty yuan before escaping.

Yesterday evening, at approximately 7 PM, three bandits, two wearing blue short shirts and pants, and one wearing a blue long gown, all armed with handguns, arrived. One bandit stood guard at the door, while two ran to the counter, threatened the accountant, Pan Liuru, with a gun, and prevented him from raising an alarm. They robbed fifteen yuan and three hundred cents in small coins from the drawer. They then searched the cash box. Fortunately, the watchman from Chengzhili heard the commotion and blew his whistle.

<p>Claiming He Paid Twenty Yuan for Her - Woman Cried for Help, But No One Dared to Respond</p>
<p>At 10:10 AM yesterday, police officer Li Deming, No. 28 post, from the Zhongxing Road Police Station of the Zhabei New Gate Sub-bureau, received a report from Madam Chen Cai, who lives at No. 48 Hongnanshan Road in the vicinity, claiming that last night, thugs Gao Quanlang and others drove her husband away and forcibly took her as their wife. After receiving the report, Officer Li immediately went to the scene, brought Gao Quanlang and Chen Cai to the station, and transferred them to the New Gate Sub-bureau. According to Chen Cai's testimony to Bureau Officer Huang, she is 28 years old, from Liyang, and currently resides at No. 48 Hongnanshan Road (i.e., in the middle of Gonghexin Road). A few years ago, due to the riots of the Big Sword Society in her hometown, her husband, Zhu Yaoyue, was captured and injured while carrying ammunition. Although he escaped back from Tianjin, he died a few days later. After her husband's death, she married Mu Yisan as his wife for four years. On the 12th day of the lunar first month this year, Cai brought her from her hometown to Shanghai, residing on Hongnanshan Road. Cai is 30 years old and makes a living as a steward for others. Unexpectedly, thugs Gao Quanlang and Gao Jilang, who lived across the street, wanted to forcibly take her as their wife. Last night (i.e., the night before), Mr. Gao treated Cai Yisan to wine at the intersection of Gonghexin Road and Hongnanshan Road and told him that he could either do things openly or secretly. Openly meant that Cai Yisan should give up Chen Cai to others and never come to Hongnanshan Road again. Secretly meant dealing with him with knives. Being forced by them, Cai Yisan abandoned her and left at around 10 PM, disappearing. That night, Gao Quanlang came to sleep with her in the same bed. Because she was unwilling, she cried for help. Unexpectedly, the residents there were so afraid of the thugs that none dared to respond. During the rape, she was slapped in the face, breaking her nose, resulting in bloodstains all over her body as proof. They also placed a sharp knife about four to five inches long next to the pillow to scare her into silence. Gao Quanlang testified that he is 27 years old, from Chongming, and lives at No. 42 Hongnanshan Road. Cai sold the Cai woman to him, so he gave her twenty yuan last night. Therefore, it was proper for him to sleep with her and not forcibly take someone else's wife. He did not know when her husband left. After examining the testimony, the interrogating officer determined that the case involved the rape of someone else's wife and contained elements of deception. This sub-bureau was not able to handle it and therefore transferred it to the Public Security Bureau for investigation.</p>

<p>Huang Peiyan, a Cantonese Panyu woman residing at No. 87 Tianshou Lane, Keming Road, Hongkou, age 33, recently filed a lawsuit in the First Special District Court against Ren Feng, the wife of the deceased Ren Jianpei, from Heshan, concerning a dispute over her status. According to Huang Peiyan's complaint, she began cohabitating with Ren Jianpei in 1928. On August 29 of the following year, Ren officially recognized her as a family member. She bore two sons who both died young. In the year before last, she gave birth to a daughter named Huanzhen. On December 27 of last year, while Ren was at home, the first wife, Ren Feng, suddenly came and created a great disturbance, damaging property and forcibly dragging her husband away. This caused her husband to become ill from anger and die on January 8 of this year. Upon hearing the bad news, she rushed to the coffin with her daughter to mourn. However, the first wife and her husband's brothers refused to let her enter and even drove her away. At that time, she was still pregnant and Huanzhen was very young. For safety reasons, she had to endure it temporarily and did not dare to resist, returning with tears. Now she has given birth to another daughter, Yufang. In grief, she filed a lawsuit, requesting that the defendant, Ren Feng, be summoned to testify and be judged to confirm that she is one of Ren Jianpei's family members, and that the eldest and second daughters are Ren Jianpei's biological daughters. However, Ren Feng hired lawyer Gu Yongquan to file a defense, denying that Ren Huang was Ren Jianpei's concubine. She claimed that she had been married to Ren Jianpei for nearly 30 years and had a son. The couple's relationship was always very close. Her husband always returned home at night and never sought pleasure outside. This was known to all their relatives and friends. Last month, when her husband passed away, a stranger named Ren Huang suddenly sent a letter, claiming to be her husband's concubine and demanding a share of the inheritance. Because she ignored it, she is now suing to confirm her status. The evidence she presented is insufficient to prove her claim. According to Guangdong customs, all newborns must have their birthdates reported to the ancestral hall and entered into the family genealogy, and lanterns must be lit and a banquet held for relatives and friends at the ancestral hall during the Lantern Festival. If the plaintiff's two daughters were born to her late husband, why were these customs not followed? Furthermore, on August 26 of last year, her late husband held a birthday celebration for his mother and hosted a banquet at the Taotao Restaurant on Wuchang Road. Why did the plaintiff not come to dance and offer a toast? As for the claim that she brought her daughter to the family to mourn after her late husband's death and was driven away, this is also false. Even if her late husband had a clandestine relationship with her, it can only be considered a cohabitation relationship, not protected by law. How could she claim to have obtained the status of a family member? The lawsuit should be rejected. Yesterday, Judge Yu opened the court for interrogation. The defendant, Ren Feng, claimed to be ill and did not appear, represented by lawyer Gu Yongquan. The plaintiff, Ren Huang, appeared with her lawyer, Sun Biwu, and presented her case, submitting a red paper written by Ren Jianpei acknowledging her as his concubine and all related letters. After Judge Yu reviewed the evidence, he ordered the case to be investigated further and rescheduled for a later hearing.</p>

<p>The Zhabei District of this city has a vast area and a large population. It suffered greatly in the January 28th Incident. Although the municipal authorities have repeatedly issued housing loans, small industrial loans, and small loans for the poor after the war, they are only a drop in the bucket. The poor have not been able to benefit widely. The Zhabei branch of the city party headquarters also believes that the Zhabei small loan program needs to be actively expanded and has sent a letter to the municipal authorities requesting additional funding. The municipal government has ordered the Social Affairs Bureau to work with the Finance Bureau to handle the matter. As for the expansion plan, in addition to increasing the loan fund for the Zhabei Second Small Loan Office, it is also planned to set up a small loan office in the Caojiadu area of western Shanghai. This area is where the poor people of Zhabei are concentrated, and it is expected that there will be a great rush of people applying for loans in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e139">Abundant Production of "Noodle Fish" in Wusong <a href="#e139" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c139" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">139</a></h3>
<p>More Than One Hundred Loads Can Be Caught Every Day</p>
<p>Since spring, "noodle fish" have been produced in the waters outside the Sancha Estuary in Wusong. This is an annual marine product, and there are quite a few fishing boat owners who rely on this for a living. These "noodle fish" were discovered as early as the end of the first month of the lunar calendar. However, the output was very small. Initially, only three to five catties were caught per tide, so the price was quite high, requiring seven or eight copper coins per ounce. But the quantity was very small and could only be sold in Wusong. Until recently, the output has been abundant and the price has also decreased greatly. Seventy to eighty loads, or even more than one hundred loads, can be caught per tide. Each catty sells for only about 200 cash. In recent days, various fish shops in Wusong have packed the large quantities of "noodle fish" they receive daily into buckets, covered them with ice, and transported them to Shanghai for sale. Because these "noodle fish" are white like silver strips, taste quite delicious, and have no bones, everyone loves them, so there is no need to worry about the market being sluggish.</p>

<p>The China Alcohol Manufacturing Factory is scheduled to open at 3 PM on the 30th of this month at the factory in Bailianjing, Pudong. In order to welcome guests from all walks of life to attend the ceremony, the factory has arranged a special boat to depart from the Custom House pier at 2:30 PM on that afternoon, bound for Bailianjing. Alcohol has a wide range of uses, and China relies entirely on foreign goods for its needs, resulting in significant financial losses every year. Therefore, after the factory is established, it should be able to recover considerable rights and interests.</p>
<h3 id="e141">Record of the Annual General Meeting of Shareholders of the China Merchants Electric Power Company Held Yesterday <a href="#e141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>Lu Bohong Reports on Business Conditions - Du Yuesheng and Others Elected as Directors and Supervisors</p>
<p>According to the Dagong News Agency, the Shanghai China Merchants Electric Power Company held its annual general meeting of shareholders at 2 PM yesterday at the Ningbo Fellow-Provincials Association on Tibet Road. More than 200 shareholders attended. Manager Lu Bohong reported on the company's business conditions for the 23rd year of the Republic (i.e., the company's 17th year), as well as the company's construction projects. Dividends were distributed, and directors and supervisors were elected. Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Business Conditions: At the start of the meeting, six people, including standing directors Wang Yiting, Gu Xinyi, Zhang Xiaoliang, Du Yuesheng, Yao Ziruo, and manager Lu Bohong, served as the presidium. After formalities, manager Lu Bohong reported, stating that the company had added two million yuan in capital according to the resolutions of the previous shareholders' meeting and had begun collecting it in small amounts since July of last year. The full amount has already been collected. However, due to the bankruptcy of rural areas in mainland China and the economic downturn in various industries, the company has inevitably been affected. Public utilities should prioritize serving the convenience of citizens, and the company does not hesitate to make sacrifices and continues to actively expand its facilities. Revenue has not decreased compared to previous years, which is comforting. However, since increasing tram fares last year, revenue has actually decreased, which is also due to the poor economic situation.</p>
<p>Construction Projects: Construction is divided into two parts: electric power and trams. Regarding electric power, the capacity of the power plant was previously insufficient. Last year, a transformer substation was built on Zhongshan Road to connect to the power grid in Zhabei for supplementation. This equipment was completed last winter and started generating electricity on January 4 of this year. Due to a malfunction in the diesel engine at the Fahua plant, a high-voltage cable was used to pass through Hongqiao Road and connect to the Zhongshan Road line. To address the insufficient original power generation equipment, a new plant was planned according to the shareholders' meeting resolution. It was decided to build the new plant on the company's existing site, west of Shenjia Garden along the Bund and east of the Inland Water Company. Three 15,000-kilowatt steam turbine generators and four boilers will be installed, which are expected to be completed in the 26th year of the Republic [1937]. Regarding trams, a new line was added to the Xiaobeimen power line. New tracks were replaced in the section from Zhonghua Road Ximen to Shangwenmen. The project was completed at the end of last year. New tracks were replaced and roadbed and pavement were constructed between Shangwenmen and Xiaodongmen, completing the work in November last year.</p>
<h2>Page 12</h2>
<p>The section at the Huangjia Que Road intersection, which was originally a single track, was converted to a double track in June last year. The section at Damatou was rerouted to Lime Road, but the project has not yet been completed. Ten new motorized trams and four trailers were added this year. Concrete steel frame high poles were replaced for the tram lines along the Outer Bund.</p>
<p>Election of Directors and Supervisors: After the distribution of dividends was completed, the election of 17 directors began. Wang Yiting, Du Yuesheng, Yao Mulian, Yao Ziruo, Gu Xinyi, Zhang Xiaoliang, Huang Hanzhi, Ye Hongying, Zhu Zhiyao, Zhu Yinjiang, Ling Bohua, Yu Baoqing, Liu Hongyuan, Zhu Jilin, Feng Bingnan, Wang Yunfu, and Lu Yingen were elected. Five supervisors were elected: Zhang Wenbin, Zhu Luyi, Wen Xianglin, Jia Jiying, and Li Zuhua. After reports were presented, refreshments were served, and the meeting adjourned at approximately 6 PM.</p>

<p>Jin Hengming Also Confesses to Robbery; Both Criminals Handed Over to the Headquarters Yesterday for Legal Action</p>
<p>Dong Mingde, the leader of the detective squad of the 16th Precinct of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, learned the other day that Wang Yougen, a native of Pudong who resides at No. 53 Ruiji Lane, Jiaxing Road, in the Public Concession and runs an "Swallow's Nest," had, on the tenth day of the first lunar month of this year, at midnight, armed himself and, together with Jin Hengming, a native of Zhenjiang who formerly ran a printing business at No. 44 Mingyuanfang, Huade Road, robbed pedestrians of their property near Xiaoshijie in the city. He also robbed a certain cigarette paper shop on Yidingpan Road of 72 yuan in foreign currency and 20 jiao in small change in October of last year. At the same time, he also learned of the robbery of banknotes from the Wanfeng Rice Shop at No. 750, the intersection of Xibaoxing Road and London Road in Zhabei. Furthermore, he learned that Wang and his gang were going to gather at a certain restaurant near the Nine-Bend Bridge in the City Temple to attempt a robbery. He immediately reported this information to the captain of the general team, Lu Ying, and the director of the 16th Precinct, Huang Junfu, who immediately dispatched team leaders Han Ruisheng and Yuan Haishan, along with a large number of detectives including Guo Shiqing, Cheng Songlin, and Yu Maolong, all disguised as peddlers, to secretly surround the area near the Nine-Bend Bridge at around 4 p.m. the other day. After a while, the bandit Wang Gen indeed arrived and passed by the Nine-Bend Bridge, where the officers bravely stepped forward, arrested him, and took him into custody. After interrogation, Wang confessed directly to the robberies mentioned above and admitted to spending the stolen money without hesitation. He also revealed the hideouts of his accomplices who were still at large. The squad leader, Dong, dispatched the original case handlers, escorted by Wang, to meet with the police officers from the Jiangjiabang Police Station of the North Station Precinct at Gaolangbu at 10 a.m. yesterday. They then apprehended another bandit, Jin Hengming, and took him into custody. After interrogation, Jin also confessed to robbing with Wang and, in October of last year, to robbing the Wanfeng Rice Shop at No. 750, the intersection of Xibaoxing Road and London Road in Zhabei, of more than 300 yuan in banknotes with his accomplices Zhao Xianglin, who was still at large, and two other unnamed individuals. He confessed to receiving a share of the stolen money. After the confession, the team dispatched detective Zhang Zhongliang, escorted by Wang, to the Mai Tian Silver Shop in Xiaodongmen yesterday morning to retrieve the original stolen gold ornaments. They also went to the Wanfeng Rice Shop on London Road to have Wang and Jin identified as the robbers. They then prepared a document and handed them over to the headquarters for processing.</p>

<p>Yesterday afternoon at around 1 p.m., at the intersection of Bailinan Road and Yuyuan Road in western Shanghai, Gu Huan (currently nine years old), the son of Gu Xu, a woman from Tongzhou who resides at No. 14, Fourteen Rooms, Caojiadu, was walking from south to north when a truck with municipal license plate No. 13422 sped towards him from the opposite direction. The driver was unable to avoid him, causing Gu Huan to be knocked to the ground, his head crushed, his brains splattered, and he died instantly. Police Chief Sun Baichuan of the local police station rushed to the scene and took the driver, Chen Xichang, into custody at the Caojiadu Precinct. Subsequently, a detective from the Jing'an Temple precinct arrived at the precinct and requested that the suspect be brought in for questioning, as the incident occurred on a road built across the boundary and under the jurisdiction of the concession. Director Wang then ordered that the driver be handed over to the detective for investigation.</p>

<p>Qian Yonghai, a native of Qingpu, has been in the cloth business. A few years ago, he suffered significant losses due to customers owing him large sums of money, which led to the closure of his business. Qian has been unemployed and confined to his home for two years. He has asked friends and relatives to recommend him for business opportunities, and recently a relative introduced him to the Hengji Cotton Cloth Shop in Xinzha as a partner. Last month, the shop sent Qian to establish branches in the Qibao and Sijing areas in the interior to collect cloth. However, because the goods were not good and the purchase prices were very high, Qian closed the branches. As he was returning to Shanghai at the beginning of this month, he encountered bandits near Sijing. The bandits were furious when they found no silver dollars, so they stole Qian's account books, seals, and other items, and beat him up. Qian returned to Shanghai and reported the incident to the shop. The other day, the shop sent Qian again to Huangmiwu to set up a branch to collect goods and gave him 500 yuan in cash. Qian took the money and traveled by train the day before yesterday, getting off at Huangdu. After getting off and walking near Yang'e Pond, three bandits suddenly blocked his way and robbed him, stealing the 500 yuan in cash. After being robbed, he felt deeply resentful because he had been robbed twice and could not explain it to the shop. He immediately jumped into the pond to commit suicide. Fortunately, a small boat from Jiangbei rescued him. After questioning him, they sent Qian to Shanghai yesterday afternoon and accompanied him to the shop, where they informed them of Qian's encounters with the robberies and his attempted suicide. The shop then sent him to the hospital for treatment.</p>

<h3 id="e151">Glass Industry Association Submits a Letter <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>The Glass Industry Association sent a letter to the Customs Commissioner of the Jianghai Customs, stating: "Respectfully, the members of our association, who are engaged in the glass business, all entrust foreign firms to order from overseas manufacturers, transport to Shanghai, and then sell to various ports in the country. According to regulations, they usually report for export with a permit. Even for scattered, non-boxed glass, they only need to present the permit to be exempted from export duties. However, your office has changed the old practice, requiring that all glass exports be in their original boxes; otherwise, an import tax must be paid upon arrival at the destination. It is understood that your office's new regulations are due to concerns about the potential for replacement and counterfeiting, as only the glass is affixed with paper-printed trademarks. Therefore, only original boxes are allowed, and the export of scattered, non-boxed glass is prohibited. The intention is good, and merchants should comply with it. However, glass products, unlike other items, have the difficulty of not being able to deeply engrave trademarks on the surface. As for ordinary glass of sizes 16 to 18, which are commonly priced at one hundred square feet per box, there are currently no difficulties in exporting them in their original boxes. However, large sheets, thick sheets, and patterned sheets contain hundreds of square feet per box, are more expensive, and have less demand, making it necessary to unpack or combine boxes for export. Since import duties have already been fully paid on glass imports, and there are no flat glass manufacturing plants in Shanghai or its neighboring areas, it can be known that all glass in Shanghai has already been taxed and there is no untaxed glass that can be used to offset the tax. Furthermore, glass is often broken during import, and if one wants to re-export it, the broken parts must be removed, making it impossible to keep the original box intact. Under the new regulations, this would also be subject to re-taxation. In this time of commercial recession, merchants cannot bear any additional burdens. Now that your office allows original boxes of glass to be exported tax-free, it seems that scattered, non-boxed glass should also enjoy the same treatment and should not be discriminated against, in order to achieve fairness. Therefore, we respectfully submit our difficulties and hope that your office will consider the merchants' difficulties and allow the old regulations to continue to be followed, so that scattered, non-boxed glass can be reported for export and be exempted from tax, just like original boxes. We respectfully request your consideration for the sake of public convenience."</p>

<p>Honors for the China Mental Hospital - The Shanghai Mental Hospital affiliated with the China Mental Hospital, located next to the Xiaocai Market on Dongyouheng Road, Hongkou, specializes in treating all kinds of mental illnesses and has achieved remarkable results. Institutions from all over the country have heard of its reputation and are sending more and more patients for treatment. Among the most recent patients sent for treatment are six female patients with mental illness, Xu Ma, Xu Zeying, Cai Wu, and others, detained by the Municipal Public Security Bureau, and one male patient with mental illness, Chen Daotian, detained by the Yulin Road police station. In addition, the China General Relief Association for Women and Children has repeatedly sent female patients with mental illness, paralysis, and epilepsy, all of whom have been admitted, treated, and fully recovered. Wang Yiting, the president of the association, was so grateful that he personally inscribed the four characters "挽回沉疴" (Recovering from Chronic Illness), which the association had made into a plaque and sent to the hospital yesterday afternoon to express their praise.</p>
<p>Integrated Chinese and Western Hospital Establishes Smoking Cessation Department - The Integrated Chinese and Western Hospital, located at No. 66 Avenue Haig in the French Concession, was founded by Chinese and Western doctors from the World Red Swastika Society Hospital. The Chinese medicine department is headed by Zhang Cigong and Shen Caizhi, while the Western medicine department is headed by Tang Ruiyuan and Deng Yuanhe. All are outstanding talents of the time, and their experience in treating diseases has long been known in society. The establishment of this hospital will benefit society and improve people's lives in no small way. It is reported that the hospital has established a special smoking cessation department, applying the latest scientific methods to quit smoking, so that those who quit experience no pain and even feel more comfortable than when they were smoking. Such a hospital is rescuing smokers from the abyss and lifting them to a place of comfort, truly a beacon in the dark world of opium.</p>
<p>Dr. Wang Ji'an Relocates Clinic - Dr. Wang Ji'an, a medical doctor specializing in hemorrhoids and a graduate of the Japan Medical University, has had his clinic on the second floor of the Women's Bank next to the Hongmiao Temple on Nanjing Road for more than a year. Whether it is chronic hemorrhoids, anal fistula, or other anorectal diseases, he is able to bring about recovery. Therefore, the number of patients seeking medical attention has been increasing day by day, so much so that the original clinic on Nanjing Road is no longer sufficient. In order to facilitate patients seeking medical attention, he has found a new location on the second floor of No. 503 North Sichuan Road, opposite Dongwuchang Road, next to the Wing On Silver Company, which is more spacious. It is reported that Dr. Wang will be seeing patients at his new clinic starting from today.</p>

<p>To the Esteemed Editor:</p>
<p>I am writing to you regarding the report in your newspaper's local news section about my residence being robbed and my abduction. I was shocked upon reading it. My residence was indeed robbed a month ago, and I promptly reported the loss to the Public Security Bureau and requested an investigation. The total loss was only about one hundred yuan. However, your newspaper reported that several thousand yuan were stolen. My family is not wealthy, so how could there be such a large sum of money? Exaggerating the facts is inconsistent with the truth. Furthermore, the report stated that I mistakenly associated with bandits and was held in soft custody for ransom. This is even more bizarre. While your newspaper claims to record everything that is heard and publish every manuscript, I was never abducted, and there was no ransom. Moreover, all my friends are well-behaved and there are no disreputable people among them. In addition, this news item is related to my personal reputation and financial well-being. Therefore, I am writing to you to clarify the truth and request that your newspaper promptly correct the previous erroneous report so that the outside world can understand the truth and there will be no further rumors. It would be a great service.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Qian Sanduo</p>

<p>As silver flowed out, Shanghai's silver reserves naturally decreased. At the end of the year, the total reserves were only 33.5 million yuan, which was two-thirds of the mid-year total at the end of May, a decrease of 10.2 million yuan compared to the same period last year. However, the percentage of foreign banks in the silver reserves decreased monthly after starting at 49.2 percent at the beginning of the year, nearly half. It was only 17.7 percent in December, amounting to 5.6 million yuan. The percentage of Chinese banks was 82.3 percent, amounting to 26 million yuan. It can be seen that most of the silver outflow this year was exported by foreign banks. Only the total reserves decreased, which inevitably had an impact on the economic sector.</p>

<p>As silver flowed out and the amount of available currency in the market was insufficient, the amount of banknotes issued by banks increased accordingly. At the end of this year, the total amount of banknotes issued by various banks reached 41.1 million yuan, an increase of 6.6 million yuan or 19 percent compared to the end of 1933. In terms of the relative changes in issuance by different banks, the Central Bank had the fastest increase. Its issuance amount (accounting for 18.8 percent of the total) was second only to the Bank of China (accounting for 32.6 percent of the total). The total amount of reserves for the Four Banks, the China Industrial Bank, and the Commercial Bank also increased compared to the previous year. However, the China Bank, the Bank of Communications, the Zhejiang Industrial Bank, the Ningbo Commercial Bank, and the Development Bank showed slight decreases.</p>
<p>This year's interbank lending rate was extremely low in the first six months because of the continuous influx of silver and Shanghai's abundant reserves, with the highest rate being no more than 9 percent and the lowest even being interest-free. It became slightly tighter in July. In August, as silver flowed out more, the interbank lending rate gradually increased, reaching a high of 15 percent and an average of 9 percent. In September, the United States announced the nationalization of silver, and silver prices soared, making interbank lending even more expensive, with a monthly average of 11.6 percent. After the export tax on silver, the outflow of silver slowed down slightly, and the interbank lending rate stabilized slightly. After November, due to supply and demand, the interbank lending rate increased again, reaching a high of 60 percent and a low of 20 percent, a rare record since the beginning of the year. However, the impact of last year's changes in the interbank lending rate on industry and commerce was minimal, as the fluctuations were entirely driven by the flow of silver and had little to do with commercial reasons.

<h3 id="e161">Fifteen Thousand People Become Manic: China Wins the Nations Cup. In the First Half, China's Performance Falters, Portugal Leads 1-0; The Result is a Thrilling 3-2 <a href="#e161" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c161" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">161</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, in an extremely chaotic and unfavorable situation, the Chinese football team almost lost to Portugal. Fortunately, they slightly improved in the second half and defeated the Portuguese team 3-2, winning the Nations Cup, which they had already given up for three years. The chaotic state of the Chinese formation in the first half was unprecedented. The forwards and inner defenders were flustered, and their ball skills were poor, leaving them helpless. Instead, the Portuguese team scored a goal. Within the first quarter of the second half, there was still no improvement. Li Yichen missed a penalty kick, leaving the audience in indescribable anxiety. After the Portuguese goalkeeper made a mistake and conceded a goal, the situation for China improved slightly. Subsequently, Li Yichen and Sun Jinshun each scored a goal. Finally, Portugal scored a penalty kick, resulting in a 3-2 score. Although the situation was very tense, there were very few exciting plays. Portugal was strong, with a fairly balanced attack and defense, only their goalkeeper was weak, and their left wing was slightly inferior. Colaça and Costa were steady and experienced as ever. In the first half, the performance of each Chinese player was unremarkable. Although Sun Jinshun worked hard, he achieved nothing. It was only after the first quarter of the second half that he entered a suitable state and was able to win. The stands around Shen Garden were packed with people, and the open space in front of the seats was also filled. Latecomers had no place to stand and rushed into the field, sitting around the outer perimeter, totaling more than fifteen thousand people, marking the first major event of this year's football season. Seeing the abnormal performance of the Chinese players in the first half, complaints were endless, like ants on a hot pot, extremely anxious. When the final victory was achieved, after the president of the Western Union, Grimshaw, presented the Nations Cup to the Chinese team captain, Li Ning, the ecstatic and frantic state was beyond description. The starting lineups of the two teams were as follows:</p>
<p>Chinese Team</p>
<p>Xu Heng</p>
<p>Li Ning Jiang Shanqing</p>
<p>Gu Shangrang Feng Yunyou Liang Shutang</p>
<p>Wan Xianghua Li Yichen Dai Linjing Sun Jinshun Jia Youliang</p>
<p>Portuguese Team</p>
<p>Su Chai</p>
<p>Ma Shan'er Victor</p>
<p>Remedy Costa F. Nata</p>
<p>C. Gonçalves L. Gonçalves Colaça Favão A. Nata</p>
<p>The Chaotic State is Frightening</p>
<p>Portugal kicked off first, but their probing attack was ineffective. Gu Shangrang passed the ball forward, but Wan Xianghua's cross was off target. The entire Portuguese army invaded the Chinese team's penalty area, charging left and right, which was frightening. The Chinese inner defenders felt unfamiliar, flustered, and unable to coordinate. The Portuguese right winger, Nata, missed two opportunities. Favão, full of ambition, broke through two defenses and passed to Colaça. Colaça charged towards the goal, but fortunately Xu Ting was alert and rushed out to block him. He also awarded Colaça a free kick, allowing them to escape danger. Costa returned with renewed vigor, and the Portuguese army surrounded them, making the area in front of the Chinese goal very dangerous. Fortunately, Jiang Shanqing defended effectively, preventing any accidents. Jia Youliang received a pass from center forward Dai, sending the ball into enemy territory. The goalkeeper panicked, giving China two corner kick opportunities, but they failed to score. The Portuguese attack was very strong, especially Colaça, who was frightening. Amidst the extremely bleak defense, China was fortunate enough to survive.</p>

<p>Poor Luck, Nothing Can Be Done</p>
<p>The Chinese forwards, like the inner defenders, were disorganized and listless, merely making lonely struggles, toiling back and forth, achieving nothing. Sun Jinshun once charged in but shot wide. Yi Chen attacked, but the ball grazed the right side of the goal. Jia Youliang rushed up and kicked, and the ball went into the goal with a bang. However, the referee blew the whistle and ruled it offside. After the Chinese team's frustration, Sun Jinshun went in again, intercepted the ball next to Remedy's feet, and rushed to the front of the goal, sweeping it away with force. Unexpectedly, it went straight at the goalkeeper, who calmly saved it. Once again, Old Sun sent the ball to the front of the goal, but Dai Linjing failed to reach it. Several opportunities were missed, and there was nothing that could be done about the poor luck.</p>
<p>The Loss of One Goal Leaves Everyone Stunned</p>
<p>Li Yichen shot again, but although the position was good, his foot was not accurate, and he could only sigh in frustration. Portugal's luck turned, and Nata launched an uprising on the border, copying to the Chinese hinterland. Gu Shangrang could not stop him, and he sent the ball in front of the goal. Jiang Shanqing closely guarded the goal, and the ball fell fifteen yards from the side of the battle. Gonçalves was unguarded and calmly shot, scoring. The entire audience was stunned, and the Chinese players were also panicked and tried to cheer up, but felt even more disorganized and helpless. The center defenders therefore did not dare to go forward, and were trapped at home. The forwards were even more lonely, only giving the opponent opportunities. China was thus trapped in a state of siege. Although the forwards had shots, they all missed. Fortunately, the first half was over, allowing them to rest and regroup.</p>
<p>The Penalty Kick is Missed</p>
<p>After quenching their thirst, the Chinese situation improved slightly, but was still unsatisfactory. Sun Jinshun received the ball from Little Wan, charged into an unguarded area, only seven or eight yards from the goal. He thought he could easily succeed, but little did he know that he was too hasty and missed again. Sighs arose from all around. Linjing, with the ambition of ten thousand men, was unwilling to yield and charged to the front of the goal, getting a chance for a penalty kick. The spectators felt like they had taken a cooling medicine, and that their wish could be fulfilled. Li Yichen stepped forward and kicked the ground towards the corner of the goal, but it went wide. Complaints did not cease. The bad luck had reached this point. The anxiety of the audience and players was indescribable.</p>
<p>From Despair to Triumph, Two Goals in a Row</p>
<p>At fifteen minutes, Gu Shangrang threw the ball in from the boundary line to Li Yichen. Li smoothly passed it to the front of the goal. The Portuguese goalkeeper caught it, took a step, and was about to kick it out, but unexpectedly his hand loosened and the ball fell to the ground. As if by divine intervention, the ball rolled into the goal behind him. Dai Linjing rushed to the front of the goal and kicked it hard, venting the anger in his chest. The spectators were overjoyed, and the repressed resentment was finally relieved. The sound of firecrackers arose from all around. From then on, the Chinese momentum greatly increased, and their spirits were high, washing away the previous disorganization and listlessness. The front and rear coordinated and communicated effectively. The opponent's goalkeeper was originally mediocre, and was panicked by the situation. Once, when a ball went out of bounds, he went to catch it, resulting in a corner kick. Little Wan sent it in very well, and Yichen headed it in from the front of the goal, very clearly. China then turned worry into joy and turned defeat into victory. The audience felt as if they had found a treasure, going manic and crazy.</p>
<p>Continuing Efforts Bring Another Success</p>
<p>At this point, the Portuguese lineup was slightly disordered. Furthermore, Ma Shan'er injured his foot and was reassigned to left inner forward, with Remedy being recalled. Left inner forward Gonçalves filled Remedy's vacancy, focusing on defense. China was thriving, and the Portuguese formation was thus disintegrated. In front of the goal, there were densely packed Chinese players, just like the Portuguese army had trapped China in the first half. Wan Xianghua received the ball from Yichen and shot towards the goal. The ball bounced back off the body of the enemy inner defender, Victor. Old Sun rushed forward and stole it, exercising his iron legs and shooting fiercely at the goal. The ball flew into the goal in a beautiful arc. China then took a very advantageous position of 3-1. From then on, there was no doubt that we would recover our lost territory.</p>
<p>Conceding a Penalty, But the Situation is Saved</p>
<p>With only a quarter of an hour left, both sides seemed exhausted but still fought hard without loosening up. Dai got the ball from Sun and charged under the goal. He could have taken the opportunity to shoot early, but he wanted to force his way into the goal and was overtaken by Remedy and tackled out. The goalkeeper then saved the ball and cleared it. The entire Portuguese army invaded, in a desperate attempt to succeed or die trying. Li Ning tried to steal the ball from Favão but was penalized with a penalty kick, which Costa took and swept in, making it 3-2. The Portuguese army continued to attack fiercely, trying to recover lost ground. Colaça and Favão both had frightening shots, but fortunately they missed. China then won 3-2, regaining the Nations Cup.</p>

<h3 id="e163">Tai Cup Player Xu Chengji to Play Qiu Feihai Tonight, Starting at 8 PM in Shen Garden Basketball Court, Zheng Zhaojia Drew with Karlsen Last Night <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Our country's Tai Cup players Xu Chengji and Zheng Zhaojia are scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States tomorrow. Xu Chengji arrived here from Hong Kong last night. The Association has specially arranged several exhibition matches before the two gentlemen leave Shanghai. The Shen Garden basketball court has been specially converted into an indoor tennis court. Exhibitions will be held tonight. Zheng Zhaojia first played a singles match against Karlsen under the lights, resulting in a draw, with each winning one set. Secondly, in the doubles exhibition, Zheng Zhaojia and Mrs. Dimitri Vivi defeated Karlsen and Potter by one set. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Zheng Zhaojia's performance last night seemed to be more advanced than in the past. His movements and ball strikes were more agile and faster. Some half-volley shots at the net earned a lot of applause. However, there were still double faults in his serve, and he has not yet reached his best state. His smashes were also relatively weak. His skills are on the same level as Karlsen's. Zhaojia is still young and strong, and when he returns from his travels in Europe and the United States, his skills should be impressive.</p>
<p>Details of the Singles and Doubles Matches Singles: Karlsen served first and won a game. Zheng Zhaojia then won three games in a row to take a 3-1 lead, then 4-2. However, in the eighth game, Zheng lost his own serve, and was overtaken 5-4. Until 7-7, Zheng won two games in a row to win the first set 9-7. In the second set, Karlsen suddenly became brave and took a 4-1 and then 6-2 lead, resulting in a 1-1 draw. Doubles followed, with Zheng Zhaojia and Mrs. Dimitri Vivi against Karlsen and Potter. Dimitri was the 1930 US women's champion, and her technique was above that of ordinary men, so the situation was very tense. They were always one game apart, but in the end Karlsen hit three wild balls in a row to end the match. Only one set was played, and Zheng and Dimitri won 15-13.</p>
<p>Tonight's Schedule</p>
<p>Singles: Xu Chengji vs. Qiu Feihai, starting at 8 PM</p>
<p>Doubles: Xu Chengji Zheng Zhaojia vs. Qiu Feihai Karlsen, starting at 9 PM</p>

<p>Japanese Davis Cup tennis representatives Yamagishi and Nishimura are scheduled to pass through Shanghai today on their way to Europe. The local Chinese Tennis Club has specially organized an exhibition match in conjunction with the Japanese Sports Association in Shanghai and the Tokyo Japan Tennis Association. Coincidentally, our country's Davis Cup representatives Xu Chengji and Zheng Zhaojia are also scheduled to leave Shanghai for the United States tomorrow, so they were specially invited to participate in a joint Sino-Japanese Tai Cup exhibition match. However, as the permission of the National Sports Association of China was not obtained, there was a problem with Xu and Zheng participating in the performance. Secretary-General Shen Siliang expressed his opposition, so the schedule was revised as follows: It will still be held at the Chinese Tennis Club at 5 Singapore Road.</p>
<p>12:15 PM Singles: Yamagishi vs. Karlsen</p>
<p>1:00 PM Doubles: Nishimura Yamagishi vs. Lin Baohua Bonner Fayqu</p>
<p>1:15 PM Singles: Nishimura vs. Lin Baohua</p>
<p>Singles: Yamagishi vs. Nishimura</p>
<p>The Japanese Davis Cup representatives went to the Association last night at 10:00 PM to discuss tonight's competition. If the team's players arrive in Shanghai today without any other problems, they will participate in a doubles exhibition match with Xu and Zheng in the final match.</p>

<p>Educational News</p>
<h3 id="e178">National Higher Education Trends Since the Founding of the Republic <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education has compiled statistics on the general state of national higher education for the 21st year of the Republic, which was reported in the newspapers. Now, we have sorted and summarized the already compiled national higher education situation over the years, recording the trends in national higher education since the founding of the Republic, and made some comparisons as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Number of Schools</p>
<p>The total number of higher education institutions nationwide in the 21st year of the Republic was 104 (76 universities and independent colleges, both public and private, and 28 specialized schools, both public and private). There were 103 in the 20th year, 86 in the 19th year, 70-plus in both the 17th and 18th years, 108 in the 14th year, and 80-plus in the 9th, 7th, and 5th years of the Republic. There were 104 schools in the 4th year and 102 in the 3rd year, 116 in the 2nd year, and 115 in the 1st year. Comparing these figures, the number of schools in the 1st and 2nd years of the Republic was actually higher than in the 21st year. However, the higher numbers at that time were mainly specialized schools. There were fewer universities. In the first year of the Republic, there were 111 private specialized schools and only 4 public and private universities and independent colleges. In the second year, there were 109 specialized schools and only 7 universities and independent colleges. In the third year, there were also 7 universities and independent colleges. From the fourth to the eighth years, there were 10 universities and independent colleges each year, and 11 in the ninth year. In the tenth year of the Republic, the number of universities and independent colleges increased to 15, 18 in the eleventh year, 24 in the twelfth year, 32 in the thirteenth year, and since the sixteenth year, the number has increased every year (44 schools in the 16th year, 49 in the 17th year, 50 in the 18th year, 59 in the 19th year, 73 in the 20th year, and 76 in the 21st year). From this, it can be seen that the increase in the total number of schools from the 1st to the 14th years of the Republic was mainly due to the increase in the number of specialized schools (the highest number of specialized schools was 111 in the 1st year, and the lowest was 58 in the 14th year). From the 17th to the 21st years of the Republic, the trend in higher education was a decrease in the number of specialized schools (from 25 to a maximum of 30) and an increase in the number of universities and independent colleges.</p>
<p>(2) Number of Teachers</p>
<p>The total number of teachers in higher education institutions nationwide in the 21st year of the Republic was 6,709 (5,974 in universities and 735 in specialized schools), 7,053 in the 20th year, 6,000-plus in both the 18th and 19th years, and 5,000-plus in the 17th year. From the 1st to the 5th years of the Republic, there were 2,000-plus teachers (including 1,000-plus teachers in specialized schools in the 3rd, 5th, 8th, and 9th years of the Republic). From the 17th to the 21st years of the Republic, the number of teachers in specialized schools ranged from 600-plus to 800-plus.</p>
<p>(3) Number of Students</p>
<p>The total number of "enrolled" university and specialized school students in the 21st year of the Republic was 42,710 (35,640 in universities and 7,070 in specialized schools), 44,167 in the 20th year, 37,566 in the 19th year, 29,123 in the 18th year, 25,198 in the 17th year, 36,321 in the 14th year, 17,241 in the 5th year, 25,242 in the 4th year, 33,373 in the 2nd year, and 42,114 in the 1st year. The number of "graduated" university and specialized school students was 7,311 in the 21st year, 7,034 in the 20th year, 4,000-plus in both the 19th and 18th years, 3,253 in the 17th year, 2,000-plus from the 12th to the 16th years, 1,000-plus from the 3rd to the 11th years, 976 in the 2nd year, and 490 in the 1st year.</p>
<p>(4) Amount of Funding</p>
<p>The total amount of funding in the 21st year was 33,203,821 yuan (31,625,252 yuan for universities and 1,887,569 yuan for specialized schools), 36,192,377 yuan in the 20th year (31,682,507 yuan for universities and 1,936,730 yuan for specialized schools), 29,867,474 yuan in the 19th year, 25,533,343 yuan in the 18th year, 17,909,810 yuan in the 17th year, 15,446,338 yuan in the 14th year, 3,673,155 yuan in the 5th year (883,069 yuan for universities and 2,790,086 yuan for specialized schools), 4,682,963 yuan in the 4th year (1,306,058 yuan for universities and 3,376,905 yuan for specialized schools), 5,728,476 yuan in the 3rd year (2,426,911 yuan for universities and 3,301,565 yuan for specialized schools), 4,171,372 yuan in the 2nd year (822,865 yuan for universities and 3,348,507 yuan for specialized schools), and 3,971,361 yuan in the 1st year (755,730 yuan for universities and 3,215,631 yuan for specialized schools). Comparing these figures, the funding for specialized schools from the 1st to the 14th years of the Republic was mostly around 3,000,000-plus yuan (also 2,700,000-plus in the 5th and 9th years). From the 17th year onwards, the funding for specialized schools decreased to 1,100,000-plus yuan, with a maximum of only 1,900,000-plus yuan. The funding for universities before the 14th year of the Republic was mostly no more than 2,400,000-plus yuan, with a minimum of only 700,000-800,000 yuan in the 1st and 5th years, which is forty times less than the recent 30,000,000-plus yuan.</p>

Mr. Jiang was in high spirits and full of wit and humor, still retaining his leisurely and graceful demeanor. Mr. Jiang first warmly treated the professors with delicacies and fine wine. As the wine flowed freely and the atmosphere became more relaxed, he delivered a long speech, which was deeply meaningful and highly valuable for young people across the country. A detailed record of his speech is provided below:</p>
<p>The morale of the nation has declined to such a state that if we do not point out a real path and a magic weapon, who will still believe? Idealism? Eastern culture? The Chan Buddhist nature and the Song Confucian principles were transplanted to the East to cultivate the so-called Bushido, but the producing country, China, has failed in every battle. Materialism? Western culture? Watt's machines and Edison's electricity are used by others to build wealth and enhance national power, to construct so-called capitalism. Fifty years ago, Japan was also once a colony, but China, which imported Western culture even earlier than Japan, has seen its rural areas declare bankruptcy and its factories demand relief. Is it because people are incurable and all medicines are ineffective? If so, the name "Chinese flag" should have disappeared centuries ago. Why is it that even today, there is still a large population living on the mainland? Let us examine the past and find out what the real skills of the Chinese flag are.</p>
<p>From the rise and fall of the Chinese flag, from the beginning of world history to the present day, I have discovered a fundamental principle: "Those whose living conditions are consistent with their combat conditions are strong; those whose conditions are separate are weak; and those whose conditions are opposite perish." Living and combat are essentially the same thing seen from two different perspectives. However, based on the evolution of economic and combat conditions, there is a tendency for separation at all times. Although Greece and Rome have earned the reputation of being culturally advanced in Europe, the inheritors of Greek and Roman culture today are not the Greeks and Romans of that time. The general reason for their great culture and eventual decline is the inconsistency between their living tools and their combat tools.</p>
<p>There are two types of consistency between living conditions and combat conditions that have been unconsciously achieved through natural tools. One is the Mongols' horse, and the other is the British's ship. They used horses to find water and grass and used ships to conduct business. Horses and ships were both tools for eating and tools for fighting. Therefore, they conquered the world twice. There are also two types that have been successfully achieved through elaborate artificial systems. One is the Westerners' national mobilization, which was invented during World War I and implemented only in the last ten years, and the other is the well-field system and feudalism that China implemented 3,000 years ago. Its true spirit is the consistency between living conditions and combat conditions.</p>
<p>Feudalism is not tribal separatism (recent people who refer to separatist tribal ideology as feudal ideology are using the term incorrectly). It is a tool to break tribal separatism. Conferment is colonization, and construction is a consistent construction of living (economy) and combat (national defense). The well-field system is not about equal distribution of property (which was not a strange thing at the time). It is a national defense system that allows people to farm and eat while also being able to send troops to fight (which was national mobilization at the time). Zhou Gong was the one who understood and created this principle. Guan Zhong was the one who inherited it (the Zuo Zhuan says that the territory of Qi, "exhausted its fields to the east," which proves the relationship between the field system and the military system). Shang Yang was the one who finally succeeded. This is the real skill of the Chinese nation that I have discovered. If you can systematically describe it so that young people can feel the greatness of the inherent skills of our Chinese nation, that we were able to unify the Asian continent in the past, why can't we unify the world in the future? Perhaps it will provide some remedy for the current decline in morale. (To be continued)</p>

<p>— (Master of Shiyuan)</p>
<p>Every store has a stream of people browsing, but the coffin shop is the most deserted; however, the most reliable and profitable business is still the coffin shop. No matter how depressed the world is, the coffin shop seems to be immune. Moreover, the more panicked society is, the more depressed all industries are, the more miserable people's lives are, and the less secure people's lives are, the better the coffin shop's business is.</p>
<p>The most frightening thing to pass by is the coffin shop, the most frightening thing to encounter is a coffin procession, and the most unbearable thing is a three-inch paulownia coffin with a corpse lying horizontally. People are arrogant and invincible in life, but they cannot escape this tragic and desolate ending, which is the most unclean and unpleasant moment. There are countless birds flying in the sky, but after death, they are invisible and traceless, clean and tidy. Can humans not be as good as birds?!</p>
<p>Work and reward are, in fact, completely opposite. A university professor can effortlessly receive tens of dollars for teaching one hour; an elementary school teacher shouts all day long, working as an assistant and even doing chores, and still cannot earn more than tens of dollars a month. A small clerk in an agency, careful and diligent, busy and dizzy, extremely hard-working, earns only tens of dollars a month. A high-ranking official, sitting in a high position, bored and idle, receives a salary that is not counted, and public expenses are also one hundred, two hundred, ... dollars.</p>

<p>Since the relocation of the military headquarters to Hongdu, officials and dignitaries have gathered, and hotels and civilian houses have been rented out completely. Rental prices have skyrocketed, and landlords have all profited threefold. Later arrivals cannot obtain even a tiny piece of land for tens of gold. Recently, with the relocation of the military headquarters to Han, officials and their families have departed one after another, and many empty houses have suddenly become available. The "for rent" signs, which were never seen before, have gradually increased. Landlords are unwilling to lower prices for the time being, still demanding the original rent, resulting in many houses remaining unoccupied. Moreover, many newly built hotels and civilian houses are still under construction, leaving the owners in a dilemma.</p>
<p>Residents have deep-rooted habits, and although they have undergone the baptism of the New Life Movement, it seems that they have not been fundamentally reformed. During the Lunar New Year, firecrackers are set off in every household, lasting for more than ten days. Recent temple fairs in the suburbs and lantern festivals in the city still follow the old customs. Middle and lower-class families still use rickshaws for wedding processions, with a red silk bundle tied on top. The use of automobiles is limited to incumbent high-ranking officials, as commercial automobile companies are rare, and most of the households relocated from bandit areas are poor. Few local residents are from wealthy families.</p>
<p>Newspapers from Shanghai arrive here in four days at the earliest, and magazines published half a month ago are still not seen for sale. There are more than ten bookstores, most of which sell discounted books and magazines as their main business. Specialized works have limited sales, and Western books, except for the Commerce, China, and World Publishing Houses, are not sold in other stores.</p>
<p>There are seven or eight daily newspapers, with mediocre editing and printing. In the past, the main source of material was news about bandit suppression. Now that the military campaign to suppress bandits has ended, the source of manuscripts is quite lacking, and editors are all frowning.</p>

<p>"Armored Car" is Mr. Hu's nickname, but when we see these three characters, our blood vessels burst and we experience waves of hidden pain! Mr. Hu has this nickname, which seems quite fun on the surface, alas! It's very sad, it only started after January 28th: we haven't seen the scars given by the armored car, so its power is not obvious. Maybe many people couldn't call out this name before this weapon of war; Mr. Hu is an athlete, he is the first graduate of the gymnastics school in the late Qing Dynasty, he is fifty-five years old this year, he has lived in Shanghai for decades, he never relies on vehicles when walking alone, he participates in amateur race walking competitions every time, and he runs like a charge even when he takes a casual walk, the leather shoes he wears are different from ordinary styles, the sound is clattering, like an armored car chasing; he has statistics on wearing leather shoes, a total of one hundred and twenty-five pairs; he is good at steel-pen drawings, willow branch writing, and he also drew a fan for this journal's "Du Weng" the year before last; he is good at photography, he knows music, he is a versatile athlete, and he still works as a physical education teacher; every thread on his body is different from ordinary people, a pair of narrow-rimmed gold-rimmed glasses from the newest style, changed to the oldest style, from the oldest style, and changed to today's most modern; he is a free love, his wife is a female student who he successfully chased during his school days, he held a civilized wedding, and was the original sixth in Shanghai; he goes to sleep, and gets up as soon as he wakes up, and doesn't sleep again, saying that sleeping again is like an extra, enough is enough, he doesn't need it; so no matter the cold, heat, warmth, he always gets up at four o'clock, he walks from Fang Xie Road in Ximen to the Shanghai-Taizhou bus station in Zhabei, takes a turn, and it's still eight o'clock in the morning; his umbrella, the upper part goes to the top pole, the lower part goes to the handle pole, only the area of the umbrella cloth, rolled into a layer of newspaper, is held under his arm, light and exquisite, shielding from the sun on sunny days, acting as rain on rainy days; everything else is very unique; so the students also call him "Civilized Mr."</p>

<p>— Du Yun</p>
<p>In Shanghai, there are several special occupations that are not seen in the inland areas, "digging ditches" being one of them. Because the ditches on the side of the road are set up to hold rainwater, there will be passers-by in normal times who inadvertently drop coins, ornaments, and so on. Or the loss is limited and not worth retrieving; or when it is lost, even the person himself did not realize it, so there is a kind of person who "digs ditches" to earn a living!</p>
<p>The drainage holes on both sides of the road are deeper! The "ditch digger" has to have one device to make a support and be able to move around. One hand holds a bamboo pole, the head of the pole is tied with a scoop, first move the drainage hole cover, insert the bamboo pole as much as possible, scoop to the bottom, drag the mud and water, and pour it on the side of the hole; another quick hand gropes and picks out copper coins, silver corners, etc., and throws them into a jar. The hand section must be agile, and the eyes must be sharp. Digging one hole after another, calmly, two people can earn more than half a dollar a day on average.</p>
<p>The drainage ditches in the alleys are shallower! Just one person, rolling up their sleeves and reaching in to grope inside. According to their experience, the area around Shantou Road Xiaohuayuan Daqingli is a lucrative place. Once every half month, each hole can have eighty or ninety copper coins, because people in brothels often welcome and send people at midnight, and copper coins and silver corners are often dropped in the dark and slip into the drain.</p>
<p>"Digging drainage ditches" is already a special occupation, but there are also those who rely on sweeping garbage and brushing dust to make a living. It is said that in silver shops, someone is willing to pay hundreds of dollars a year to take over the garbage and dust, not only sweeping the ground clean every day, but also wiping the dust on the walls and the dirt on the tables; even the old clothes worn by silversmiths and the old shoes worn on their feet are willing to give you new ones in exchange for your old ones. Because in silver shops, gold and silver scraps are scattered everywhere, they will use all methods to collect them, make something out of nothing, and the profits are still very high!</p>

<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter 11: Melancholy Night Talk: A Life is But a Dream; Scattered Footprints: The Wind and Rain Are Too Oppressive</p>
<p>Jia Duocai said, "It's very late. Xi'an city is pitch black, you can't see where you're going. Take this flashlight with you." Yang Huanhua smiled, revealing her teeth, and said, "I don't need to go, I've already paid for the room next door. I'm not leaving until tomorrow morning." As she spoke, she steadied herself by holding onto the edge of the table, as if hesitating. Seeing that Jia Duocai didn't say anything, she finally said, "Mr. Jia, I'm intruding on you tonight." After saying that, she smiled slightly again. Seeing that Jia Duocai still didn't say anything, she lowered her head and left. Jia Duocai didn't move either. He composed himself and smoked two cigarettes. In his heart, he thought about how there were all kinds of people in this Little Western Paradise hotel. Two large gasoline lamps were lit at the entrance. Old-fashioned horse-drawn carriages, ordinary rickshaws, and automobiles from big cities were all parked haphazardly, creating a lively scene. The poor people passing by the entrance all wondered how they could get inside. But they didn't realize that among the people staying here, there were those who were comfortable, but there were even more who were not as well off as the poor people outside who couldn't get in. Take Zhang Jiewei, for example, he fancied himself as a young master. Just because I promised to write a letter to Director Gao, he eagerly took on the task of pimping. Thinking about him, he's probably not unlike this Miss Yang, feeling very uncomfortable inside. Alas! It's hard to make a living. That was what he was thinking in his heart, and unconsciously, he sighed out the word "alas." He was leaning back in his chair, smoking, not paying attention to anything outside himself. At this moment, a quiet voice said, "Mr. Jia, are you feeling very sad?" Jia Duocai immediately sat up straight and looked around, but there was no one there. Just as he was feeling very strange, the small voice said again, "Mr. Jia, I'm peeking at you through the crack in the wall. Would you like to come and sit with me?" Jia Duocai then realized that Yang Huanhua was still there, spying on him. He nodded towards the wall and said, "No need, I'm going to sleep." (165)</p>

<p>— Originally written by Princess Der Ling of the Qing Dynasty, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>The Empress Dowager, in order to show me a realistic example, took me to the silkworm room to observe. In several small bamboo trays, I indeed saw many silkworm moths; although they had wings, they could not fly, but could only crawl clumsily forever.</p>
<p>These moths were also divided into male and female, and they were mixed together in a bamboo tray. This bamboo tray was their world; apart from this bamboo tray, they could not touch anything else. And they themselves seemed to have no ambition to think about going outside the bamboo tray; as for how big the content of this bamboo tray was, or whether it was safe for them, they didn't care at all. What's even stranger is that unlike other insects, after they turned into moths, they didn't want to eat anything; their activity was just to choose a mate and mate with each other. After mating once, the male died first, leaving only the females to complete the task of laying eggs. At this time, the silkworm-raising girls had to pick out the dead male moths and discard them, so as not to obstruct. Underneath the bamboo tray, white paper had been laid out long ago. After a day or two, the female moths would lay their eggs on the paper. When I looked again the next night, I saw countless silkworm eggs, like black sesame seeds, scattered on the paper, and many dead female moths. Of course, they were no longer needed and were immediately discarded.</p>
<p>"Don't you find it very interesting? Really! This is nothing less than a microcosm of life!" The Empress Dowager said in a philosophical tone, "From birth, they hurriedly complete the work they should do in their life, and then die very quickly. There is only a short period of ten or twenty days in between. But these ten or twenty days are the same for them as for us, from crawling out of our mother's womb, from infancy to childhood, from childhood to adulthood, from adulthood to middle age, old age, and finally death. There is really no difference!" (276)</p>

<p>— Shanghai News Agency</p>
<p>Flipping through history books, we found that many important figures in the officialdom used to be Shanghai Daotais: not to mention the complete history of the Qing Dynasty, just in modern history, there are these few:</p>
<p>(1) Lü Haihuan: He was appointed as the Shanghai Daotai in the 22nd year of Guangxu, but by the 29th year of Guangxu, he was already the Minister of Commerce and Trade of the Qing government. At that time, the Shanghai revolutionary movement was just beginning, and he immediately sent a letter to Su Fuen Shou, informing him that "There are so-called enthusiastic young people in the Shanghai concession who are gathering in Zhang Garden to discuss matters, nominally to reject France and Russia, but in reality, they are trying to rebel." He immediately named Cai Yuanpei, Wu Jingheng, Zhang Binglin, and Niu Yongjian for investigation and arrest. Although it was not permitted by the Bureau of Works, it later caused the sensational Su Bao case.</p>
<p>(2) Cai Jun: He was appointed as the Shanghai Daotai in the 23rd year of Guangxu, but by the 28th year of Guangxu, he was already the Qing government's ambassador to Japan. At that time, in order to promote racial revolution and revive historical concepts, Zhang Binglin and others initiated the "242nd Anniversary Commemoration of the Fall of China" in Tokyo, which shocked the Japanese academic community. He was extremely panicked and personally visited the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, requesting that the association be disbanded. The Japanese government granted his request, and a large number of students studying abroad were forced to return to China. In Shanghai, the Patriotic Society was established and the China Public School was founded.</p>
<p>(3) Rui Cheng: He was appointed as the Shanghai Daotai in the 32nd year of Guangxu, but by the time of the Wuchang Uprising of the Xinhai Revolution, he was already the Governor-General of Huguang. At that time, he first received a secret telegram from the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the Qing government, which briefly stated: "The revolutionary party Huang Xing has scheduled an uprising." Therefore, he conducted strict investigations and defenses, and captured several party members. He thought that the revolutionary organization had been broken and there would be no major trouble, and he was quite pleased with himself. Wuchang had 16,000 new troops, divided into infantry, cavalry, and artillery. They usually harbored resentment, and at this time, Rui Cheng arbitrarily searched and arrested them on suspicion. As a result, it was launched on the 19th day of the eighth month, and Rui abandoned the city and fled.</p>
<p>The above is a brief account of the important ones; the other minor ones are not listed.</p>

<h3 id="e193">A History of Public Health Progress (II) <a href="#e193" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c193" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">193</a></h3>
<p>— A lecture by Zhu Jiqing, Director of the Health Education Department of the Health Department (Notes by Cheng Xinliang)</p>
<p>(1) Training of personnel. Training of a large number of medical and nursing staff in order to achieve a public medical system.</p>
<p>(2) Medical education. Educating medical and nursing talents with a positive medical concept.</p>
<p>(3) Public education. The education above alone is not enough. Medicine is not a secret treasure. It is not the private property of doctors. It is a public asset of mankind. Therefore, medicine is absolutely open and should be applied daily. We know that for thousands of years, medicine has been like a secret treasure, so mysterious that it cannot be explained. Especially in the last thirty years, so-called scientific medicine has regarded it as a family heirloom and a golden career. If anyone knew a little medicine and applied it, it would be like committing a capital crime. There is no doubt that this is human selfishness. But now we must overthrow them. We must eliminate them. Medicine must be made public from now on. It is no longer the magic weapon of a few people. From now on, everyone has the right to apply medicine. From now on, what doctors give us is not just needles and medicine, but a true gift that contains educational medicine. From now on, the health and survival of mankind are guaranteed. This is the value of medical items, and it is also the active period of medicine.</p>
<p>(5) The evolution of public health</p>
<p>We have a considerable understanding of the relationship between medicine and society, and the changes in concepts mentioned above. Now let's talk about the evolution of public health itself.</p>
<p>The words "public health" probably originated in the period when medicine began to focus on ill health. During this period, mankind felt that health was an absolute necessity, and that health was not just about taking medicine. There must be some kind of overall plan. Therefore, people gradually began to pay attention to the health aspect. We summarize it as public health.</p>
<p>The evolution of public health can be divided into four stages.</p>
<p>(1) Environmental health. This period probably began in the 18th century. In this century, bacteriology and disinfection were invented. (Pasteur invented bacteria, Lister invented disinfection) Other inventions, such as the progress of anatomy and physiology, and the invention of X-rays, emerged like bamboo shoots after a rain, showing their brilliance. Scientific authority, the glory of mankind</p>
<p>At this time, people knew that diseases were caused by a tiny and invisible microorganism, a bacterium. These microorganisms mostly exist in the environment around people. Therefore, the health experts at this time regarded environmental improvement as the primary task of health. Such as the improvement of tap water and other drinking water, the construction of sewers, the treatment of garbage, and the cleanliness of streets. This is the initial prototype of public health. Civilized and advanced countries such as England, France, and Switzerland all did these jobs at first.</p>
<p>(2) Disease prevention. This is something that has happened in the last seventy years. Medical scientists believe that environmental health is only part of public health. To protect human health, it is necessary to prevent the invasion of epidemics. Therefore, the widespread and bold use of vaccination, and various prophylactic vaccinations of active and passive vaccines and serums, such as diphtheria antitoxin typhoid vaccine. The invention of Scarlet Fever Serum—diseases caused by bacteria can be prevented by vaccination to achieve immunity or antitoxin. Other methods such as disinfection and isolation are also well applied.</p>
<p>Public health has made great progress.</p>
<p>(3) Early diagnosis and treatment. Even now, there are still many diseases that are not caused by bacteria, but by physiological and tissue changes. Such as cancer, tonsil swelling, and dental defects. These are all simple tissue changes. If diagnosed early and treated, cancer can be completely cured.</p>
<p>The evolution of public health is so amazing.</p>
<p>(4) Public education. I said above that medicine is like a daily necessity for the public. It is not the private property of a few doctors. Moreover, doctors cannot manage many things. I must declare that I am not looking down on doctors. Moreover, I especially admire doctors who are scientific and psychologically sound (truly moral). However, what I mean is that the knowledge and experience of medicine and disease prevention should be known and assisted in practice by everyone. I myself am also a doctor and dare not belittle myself. A naked heart is laid bare in front of everyone. There are no secrets. Everyone, look. This is medicine. This is the medicine of the human masses. Doctors are in a position of research and guidance. The public is in a position of experience.</p>
<p>Public health has evolved to this stage, which can be considered the peak.</p>
<p>(5) Preventive medicine. Public health, since it has progressed to the peak position with the power of society, we dare not say that it cannot be further improved. But we are actively doing it.</p>
<p>I said that reading history can teach you many experiences. We can turn these experiences into our own experiences. We can catch up head-on and take fewer detours.</p>
<p>At the same time, we can also know that the mortality rate of civilized and advanced Western countries is much lower than ours. The life expectancy is also much higher than ours. Therefore, they can make their countries rich and strong and increase their status. Looking back at our home, what is it like? Bending over and hunching shoulders, yellow face and thin muscles, high mortality and low life expectancy. How painful!</p>
<p>Therefore, the purpose of our future public health management is to:</p>
<p>Reduce mortality. Increase human lifespan. Improve health. Transform the nation. Enhance international status. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e194">Skin Hygiene and Prevention of Skin Diseases (IV) <a href="#e194" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c194" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">194</a></h3>
<p>— Xie Yunshou</p>
<p>Third is soap. When we wash, we often use soap. It is easy to remove dirt and other unclean things, so that the skin is completely clean. Therefore, soap is very important for skin hygiene. Therefore, its types and effects must be understood.</p>
<p>The ingredients of soap are made by mixing alkali salts (that is, sodium brine or potassium brine) and fat and boiling them. It is a chemical mixture that can be divided into two types: sodium soap and potassium soap. Sodium soap has a soft texture. Potassium soap has a hard texture. There is also a type that is made by fully mixing alkali and fat. This is called neutral soap. Its effect is the mildest.</p>
<p>Soap dissolves in water and can form foam. Applying it to the skin can not only dissolve the fat on the skin surface, but also make the stratum corneum of the skin expand and soften, making it easier to peel off. Therefore, the attached dust and dirt are also easily removed. The stronger the alkali of the soap, the stronger its effect. However, hard water is not suitable for the application of soap. If it must be used, it is best to boil it. At this time, soap is effective for cleaning the skin, but it should be moderate. If used excessively, it will be harmful to the skin. Because when the skin is thin and has little fat, excessive use of soap will strip away the sebum of the skin, making it lose its luster and become dry and rough, which can easily cause chapped skin and eczema. Therefore, people with thin skin and lack of sebum should not use too much soap. If you must use it, you should also choose a mild one. If it is also inappropriate, you can use rice bran juice instead. On the contrary, people with more sebum should use soap often. Even a slightly stronger one is not harmful. The nature of the skin also varies depending on the location. For example, the hair on the head is abundant, and there is also a lot of sebum. Strong potassium soap can be applied. The strength and weakness mentioned here refer to the nature and effect of soap. The most ideal soap is neutral sodium soap. It can be used often without harm. There are two conditions for choosing soap. First, when making soap, do not mix in various by-products. Second, there must be no free excessive alkali. If there is free alkali, it will irritate the skin and saltify the fat on the epidermis, making the skin rough. However, the determination of whether soap is good or bad is actually very difficult. It is best to try it yourself. If there are no unexpected irritations, dryness, roughness, tension, etc. on the skin after trying it, there will probably not be excessive alkali.</p>
<p>The above are commonly used soaps. There is also a type called medicated soap, which is the potassium soap mentioned above. Its alkali is very strong and is not suitable for ordinary use. It can only be used for medicinal purposes to remove large amounts of sebum, dust, and dandruff. The other medicated soaps mentioned contain various drugs. This is not suitable for ordinary skin hygiene and is used for special skin diseases.</p>
<p>The purpose of using medicated soap is to assist in local treatment of the skin. For example, acne, seborrhea, and parasitic diseases (tinea, ringworm, etc.). If you use it without asking about the symptoms, it will have various disadvantages. Also, merchants often have improper quality because of profit. At the same time, it is stored in the window for a long time. This is not only unsuitable for application, but also because the drug components are denatured and its volatile substances are dissipated, becoming ineffective. Therefore, it is best not to use such medicated soap.</p>
<p>Medicated soaps have many types due to the different properties of the drugs. For example, boric acid soap has the mildest properties. In addition, tar soap, sulfur soap, and "Nafta" soap can be used for seborrhea, acne, folliculitis, and parasitic skin diseases. Peppermint soap and carbolic acid soap can be used for pruritus and other itchy skin diseases. However, it should be prohibited during fresh acute symptoms. Ichthyol soap can be used for seborrhea, acne, and rosacea. Hebra's potassium soap essence (potassium soap and alcohol mixed in equal parts) can remove the dandruff and scalp oil on the head. It is most suitable for cleaning. Therefore, it is most suitable for people with a large amount of scalp oil (commonly known as dandruff). The medicated soaps mentioned above are used in the same way as ordinary soaps. Use hot water to wash and be sure to wash away the foam thoroughly.</p>
<p>When washing with ordinary soap, hot water is better than cold water. But at the same time, you should pay attention to the sensitivity of the skin. That is, the use of soap should be restrained for sensitive skin. Otherwise, the skin on the face may become rough. If washing with water makes the skin rough, add some borax (two teaspoons in half a basin of water) or boric acid (two teaspoons) to soften the irritation of the washing water (especially when it is hard water).</p>
<p>There is a kind of person who often adds some milk when washing their face. This is very suitable for sensitive and rough skin. (That is, add one part boiled milk to three parts of water) Because it uses the fat in the milk to cover the skin, it can avoid the irritation of water and has a protective effect.</p>
<p>It is best to avoid washing diseased skin. If you want to wash, you must also pay extreme attention. It must not be an irritating friction. And</p>

<p>The washing time should be short. After wiping it dry, sprinkle it with powder to make it fully dry. Also, people with sensitive facial skin should not go outside immediately after washing to come into contact with outside air. Therefore, washing is best done at night. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e195">Current Situation of Medicine and Health in Songjiang <a href="#e195" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c195" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">195</a></h3>
<p>— Fu Jiren</p>
<p>(5) Physician Level</p>
<p>The qualifications of practicing physicians in Songjiang can be roughly divided into eight: (1) Graduates from Chiba Medical University in Japan. (2) Graduates from National Tongji University. (3) Graduates from the former Jiangsu Provincial Medical College. (4) Graduates from Shanghai Southeast Medical College. (5) Graduates from Zhejiang Provincial Medical and Pharmaceutical College. (6) Graduates from Hangzhou Guangji Medical School. (7) Nurses who have obtained a general physician license. (8) Those who open a business after practicing in various hospitals. Physicians have good moral concepts and no factional differences, but there are often advertisements that exaggerate private equipment, but the actual equipment is very lacking.</p>
<p>(6) Consultation Fees and Medicine Costs</p>
<p>(A) Consultation fees: Hospitals are divided into four categories: free consultation, outpatient consultation, special consultation, and house call. Free consultations are mostly ten copper coins. Outpatient consultations range from four small silver coins, four large silver coins, and half a large silver coin. Special consultations cost one large silver coin, and house calls cost two large silver coins. Overtime is doubled. Private clinics charge different fees. Some charge four small silver coins, and some charge half a silver coin. Some provide free consultations on Sundays or at certain times every day to benefit the poor.</p>
<p>(B) Medicine costs. Doctors in Songjiang all have their own pharmacies, because pharmacies do not dispense prescriptions. The fees vary greatly. For example, in county hospitals, foreign medicines are divided into three types of porcelain boxes: large, medium, and small, each with a certain amount. Internal medicines are based on the number of days of consumption. For example, if one day's amount is 30 cents of a large silver coin, then two days is 60 cents. The prices are not based on the price of the medicine, which is very ridiculous. Other hospitals or doctors charge differently. For example, injections cost two yuan each. Therefore, very few patients receive injections. The price for pigments and other similar substances ranges from three to four yuan. 914 costs about four to five yuan. If the medicine is purchased by oneself, the surgery fee ranges from one to two yuan.</p>
<p>(7) Obstetrics</p>
<p>There are three hospitals with obstetrics departments. One is Chonghua, one is Pingzheng, and one is the Maternity Hospital attached to Deqiong Hospital. Chonghua is the most famous and has a branch hospital. The dean is Sun Chonghua, a female physician and a graduate of Hangzhou Guangji School. She has rich knowledge and experience. She can be said to be the leading new medical obstetrician in Songjiang. This hospital has been open for a long time and is highly trusted by the people of Songjiang. There are seven practicing midwives in the city. The above-mentioned four hospitals all have obstetrics departments and employ one or two midwives.</p>
<p>The people of Songjiang are still able to trust the new medical obstetrics. The fees also vary from person to person, about four yuan, six yuan, eight yuan, and sometimes increase or decrease depending on the economic situation of the patient's family. Unfortunately, it cannot be fully popularized and is mostly limited to the intellectual class. There are fewer inpatients, unless it is a difficult birth. There is no public civilian maternity hospital in this county, which is a shortcoming!</p>
<p>(8) New Pharmacies</p>
<p>There are five new pharmacies in Songjiang: Nanyang, Jihuatang, Huamei, Sino-British, and Da Wuzhou. Nanyang specializes in the pharmaceutical business, and has more medicines than other stores. It also has a branch clinic with three doctors. The other four stores also sell cosmetics, especially Da Wuzhou Pharmacy, which is jointly established with a Chinese ginseng store. Chinese and Western medicines are displayed separately in the two display windows, which is interesting. At first glance, it is impossible to tell whether it is Chinese or Western. None of the stores has a formal pharmacist who can dispense prescriptions. I once went to each pharmacy to try to get a prescription dispensed, and saw that each store used apprentices to serve customers. Except for a few people, they were all apprentices who did not know or understand the original foreign names, and acted as salespersons for Western medicines. Isn't that a joke? Most of the medicines are domestic medicines that are cheap. There are many common medicines that cannot be bought in the early city, such as Licorice Juice (Sucus Liguiri Siae), Alum stick (Alaumstiift), and Ferric Chloride Solution (Liq Ferri Sesquichlorati), which makes me, a doctor who just arrived in Songjiang, unable to prescribe. There is really no place to complain. This journal once reported that disassembled injection drugs could be purchased in the pharmacies of Huaiyin County, and the same is true in Songjiang. Compared with the original packaging, the price may be one to two times higher. According to my investigation, this phenomenon is caused by unlicensed doctors in Songjiang who specialize in giving injections.</p>

<p>— Cheng Hanzhang</p>
<p>(54) Beriberi (4)</p>
<p>(Question) What symptoms occur in the respiratory system of people with beriberi?</p>
<p>(Answer) Respiratory symptoms include difficulty breathing. The throat, bronchi, and lungs may experience mucositis, and pulmonary edema may also occur.</p>
<p>(Question) What happens within the digestive system?</p>
<p>(Answer) Symptoms in the stomach include fullness in the epigastric region, lack of appetite, and acid reflux with a burning sensation. During beriberi-related heart distress, symptoms such as thirst, nausea, and vomiting may arise. Within the intestines, constipation is a common symptom.</p>
<p>(Question) Do beriberi patients experience fever?</p>
<p>(Answer) Fever only occurs in acute, severe cases of beriberi, presenting as irregular and remitting, around 37 to 38 degrees Celsius. It disappears as the condition improves. If the fever exceeds 39 degrees, there is a risk of complications.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the typical duration of beriberi?</p>
<p>(Answer) Most cases of beriberi can be cured after several weeks to months. However, those who neglect self-care, such as overworking or having an unbalanced diet, are prone to recurrence or worsening of the condition.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the prognosis for beriberi? Is it good or bad?</p>
<p>(Answer) If treated promptly and thoroughly, even severe or cardiac beriberi can be completely cured. The mortality rate varies depending on the region, prevalence, and time of year. The causes of death are often complications, cardiac paralysis (cardiac beriberi), and paralysis of the respiratory muscles.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the key points in diagnosing this disease?</p>
<p>(Answer) The key points in diagnosing beriberi are: (1) Heaviness in the lower limbs; (2) Sensory abnormalities, especially numbness; (3) Edema; (4) Loss of Achilles or patellar tendon reflexes; (5) Cardiac symptoms, such as palpitations, rapid pulse, and enlarged heart sounds; (6) Tension in the calf muscles.</p>
<p>(Question) With which diseases should beriberi be differentiated?</p>
<p>(Answer) It should be differentiated from kidney diseases, valvular heart disease, spinal tuberculosis, myelitis, Landry's paralysis, toxic polyneuritis, acroesthesia, progressive muscular atrophy, and starvation edema.</p>
<p>(Question) How should we prevent beriberi?</p>
<p>(Answer) To prevent beriberi, first, improve the diet and eat more foods containing vitamin B1. Base your diet on wheat and unpolished rice, and consume plenty of fruits, beans, vegetables, fish, and meat. Second, pay attention to hygiene by avoiding dampness and excessive heat, and living in cooler, drier places. Third, avoid physical and mental exhaustion, and engage in moderate exercise.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the general outline of beriberi treatment?</p>
<p>(Answer) Treatment for beriberi should focus on rest, diet, medication, and relocation.</p>
<p>(Question) What are the effects of rest?</p>
<p>(Answer) Rest allows the patient's cardiac symptoms to improve. Severe cases, in particular, require absolute rest.</p>
<p>(Question) How should the patient's diet be selected?</p>
<p>(Answer) Focus on eating foods rich in vitamin B1, such as fresh vegetables (spinach, cauliflower), fruits (sweet potatoes, apples, oranges, grapes), beans (soybeans, broad beans), milk, eggs, fresh fish and meat.</p>
<p>(Question) What medications should be used?</p>
<p>(Answer) Use large doses of vitamin B1 preparations, administered orally or by injection. Diuretics, mild laxatives, and cardiac tonics may also be used.</p>
<p>(Question) What is the method of treatment through relocation?</p>
<p>(Answer) Move the patient to the countryside, especially to a highland area. Pay attention to the patient's heart strength during this time. Gradual recovery of health is possible. (End)</p>
<h3 id="e197">Medical Knowledge for Pain Relief (7) <a href="#e197" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c197" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">197</a></h3>
<p>— Li Xing</p>
<p>Stomach Pain</p>
<p>Cooked meats and broths should always be lightly seasoned and well-cooked. Avoid coarse greens (high-fiber vegetables) and spicy or sour ingredients, as well as strong seasonings. Strive to provide ample nourishment to increase the patient's health and resistance, so that the stomach pain ceases and the stomach ulcer can fully heal.</p>
<p>The most important medications for stopping stomach ulcer pain are alkaline and antacid substances. We know that stomach acid causes stomach ulcer pain, but stomach acid is essential for digestion. Using alkaline and antacid medications neutralizes the stomach acid. This prevents the stomach acid from irritating the stomach ulcer, thereby stopping the pain. This method removes the stimulus from the nerve receptors at the site of the stomach ulcer; it does not anesthetize the stomach ulcer, nor does it anesthetize the brain. This is a beneficial and harmless method of stopping stomach pain. From this, it is even clearer that the practice of simply anesthetizing the brain with opium or morphine is a deceptive method of pain relief. Understanding this basic principle, I believe that rational citizens will never choose narcotics to deceive and harm themselves. Those who have not been fooled by addictive drugs should avoid trying them, and those who have already been fooled should quickly give them up and adopt scientific methods of pain relief when experiencing stomach pain. This is what is meant by, "The sea of suffering is boundless; turn your head and the shore is at hand."</p>
<p>The most effective alkaline and antacid medications are bismuth subcarbonate, magnesium oxide, calcium carbonate, and baking soda. The effectiveness of these medications varies in duration, so it is best to take them in combination. Belladonna and other medications are also beneficial for stomach pain, depending on whether they are taken appropriately.</p>
<p>Perforation of a Stomach Ulcer A perforated stomach ulcer means that the ulcer has created a hole, connecting the inside of the stomach to the abdominal cavity. Fluids from the stomach can then flow into the abdominal cavity. This is a very serious condition. Why? Because stomach fluids entering the abdominal cavity will cause peritonitis. This type of peritonitis is extremely dangerous. If not treated properly, it is truly a case of "at least nine deaths and only one chance of survival."</p>
<p>When a stomach ulcer perforates, or after it perforates, the patient will experience intense pain in the upper abdomen, causing great suffering. This condition is a critical type of "acute abdomen." According to the principles of treating "acute abdomen," immediate intervention is necessary. However, what the patient or the patient's family wants is pain relief! Of course, pain relief is necessary, but what method should be used? Taking pain pills? Getting a morphine injection? Smoking opium? The answer is, taking pain pills is useless. A morphine injection or smoking opium can relieve the pain because narcotics can anesthetize the patient's brain, making them unaware of the pain. For example, if someone sees their property on fire, they will be extremely anxious, but if they are anesthetized, they will be calm and unconcerned. However, even if they are mentally at peace and stand idly by, will the fire not still consume their property? Relieving this type of pain with a morphine injection or smoking opium is the same. While it is true that this pain should be relieved, simply relieving the pain is not enough, because if the underlying condition is not treated, the person will die even if they no longer feel the pain.</p>
<p>In simple terms, if a skilled surgeon confirms that a stomach ulcer has perforated, surgical intervention should be performed immediately to close the hole in the stomach, allowing the patient to turn the corner. According to years of surgical experience, there is only a twelve-hour window of opportunity to save the patient's life after a stomach ulcer perforates. After twelve hours, it is considered "nine deaths and only one chance of survival." From the moment of perforation, each passing hour increases the risk, and the longer the time, the greater the danger and the less hope for survival. Under no circumstances should one simply seek pain relief through anesthesia and delay treatment in an attempt to avoid surgery. As a rule, even if surgery is performed after twelve hours of perforation, the hope for survival is very slim. Those with severe stomach pain should pay close attention to this basic scientific knowledge.</p>
<p>Appendicitis Appendicitis is caused by inflammation of the appendix. Appendicitis is a common disease. Europeans and Americans are more likely to suffer from this disease than Chinese people. However, Chinese people still suffer from appendicitis, just not as frequently. The more civilized the lifestyle, the more cases of appendicitis. People in cities are more likely to suffer from it than people in rural areas. The causes of appendicitis are not always the same, but constipation and indigestion are the most important causes. Other pathological details will not be discussed here.</p>
<p>When the appendix becomes inflamed, it will cause pain. This pain often strikes suddenly, like a disaster falling from the sky, coming in waves and being extremely painful. The pain is often located in the abdomen, about two or three inches downward and to the right of the navel. The more acute the inflammation, the more severe the pain. If the inflammation is chronic, the pain will be mild. Sometimes, the intense pain of appendicitis will suddenly stop, and the patient may experience false relief, thinking that the abdominal pain has suddenly healed. However, this is not the case. This symptom is often caused by the inflammation and swelling of the appendix leading to perforation, peritonitis, or the formation of a localized abscess in the abdomen. The most dangerous aspect of appendicitis is the peritonitis caused by the ulceration of the appendix. This type of peritonitis is extremely dangerous, so appendicitis is one of the most important "acute abdominal" conditions.</p>

<p>(40) Hyperopia (Farsightedness) and Presbyopia (Age-Related Farsightedness)</p>
<p>The Formation of Hyperopia (Farsightedness). Is also the result of the "reasons why the eye can see objects" as described in the previous section. However, it cannot implement the functions of a camera. This type of eye. Also belongs to a type of non-emmetropic (not having normal vision) eyes. In other words. It is an eyeball with an unhealthy vision. Its ability. Only allows for farsightedness. It cannot see up close. This is the complete opposite of nearsightedness. Because its crystalline lens has too little convexity. Or because its axial length (the distance from the front to the back of the eye) is too short. So the images formed by light rays. Although there are the adjustments of the iris contracting and dilating, the refraction of the crystalline lens, and its natural regulatory function. However, it cannot be completely properly projected onto the retina. Instead, it is projected behind the retina (refer to the attached diagram). Therefore, any objects at a close distance. Cannot be seen clearly. With this type of hyperopic eyeball. When reading books, writing, or working at close range. It is of course also necessary to use corrective glasses for assistance. This type of corrective glasses. Is equipped with suitable convex lenses. To change the refractive power of the crystalline lens. In this way, the images refracted by the crystalline lens. Can be completely projected onto the retina. At this time, the eyeball will also become an eye with a healthy emmetropic function. Can clearly see objects at close range. However, before configuring this type of convex lens. It should also be thoroughly checked by an ophthalmologist for the condition of the various parts of the eye. Only then is it appropriate.</p>
<p>The Formation of Presbyopia. Is caused by age-related factors. Because the crystalline lens of the elderly. Can gradually lose moisture. Elasticity also decreases. And it becomes hardened. Therefore, its ability to refract light rays. Also weakens. At the same time, its regulatory function. Also becomes incomplete. The result of having this type of eyeball. Is similar to hyperopia. It also cannot clearly see objects at close range. So when reading books, writing, or working at close range. It is also necessary to have the assistance of corrective glasses. This type of corrective glasses. Is also the reading glasses commonly used by ordinary people.</p>

<p>— Hu Jiayan</p>
<p>The typical clinical courses of exudative and proliferative forms have been generally described above! However, in reality, the condition of pulmonary tuberculosis is almost always a mixed and unclear one, with both aspects present; purely uniform forms are almost non-existent. Examples of proliferative forms transitioning to exudative forms, and exudative forms becoming proliferative or healing into sclerotic forms, are frequently seen clinically. Even within a single case, all three types of changes—exudative, proliferative, and sclerotic—can coexist. Therefore, it is practically impossible to make a definitive prediction about the prognosis based solely on the patient's examination findings at that time. Patients often fail to understand this point; but if they understand the aforementioned truth, I believe there will be no further questions!</p>
<p>Finally, let me briefly describe the clinical course of the sclerotic form and cavities. The sclerotic form mostly occurs after the proliferative form. Its course is chronic, and the symptoms are not very severe. Sometimes, it is almost indistinguishable from bronchitis. Sometimes, patients experience mild dyspnea and chest pain due to climbing or exercise, which can lead to suspicion of joint inflammation. Physical examinations often yield unremarkable results; there is no fever, and blood tests are also unremarkable, except that tubercle bacilli can sometimes be found in the sputum. The most accurate diagnosis, of course, cannot be made without X-ray fluoroscopy! The prognosis is generally favorable, unless there are concomitant exudative or proliferative changes, which are exceptions.</p>
<p>As for how cavities are formed, it has already been discussed in Chapter 5! At this time, the patient's subjective symptoms are mostly absent; for example, there is no temperature increase, and the blood count is normal. The erythrocyte sedimentation rate is a little faster, but not significantly. The presence of tubercle bacilli and elastic fibers in the sputum, and the detection of tympanic sounds during percussion, are very important for diagnosis. The course is mostly incurable without surgical treatment; the prognosis is also poor. Occasionally, scar formation due to the proliferation of new connective tissue can be seen; but it is rare and takes a very long time. (End of Chapter 9)</p>

<h3 id="e201">On Ballad Novels <a href="#e201" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c201" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">201</a></h3>
<p>— Han Feng</p>
<p>Ballad novels are a type of southern peasant literature. Their influence is as great as that of storytelling with drums in the north, as Xi Di said. This is a type of literature that is completely loved and enjoyed by women, commoners, and the illiterate. However, people who study literature have never paid much attention to them, thinking that they "do not count as literature," until recent years, when they have gradually been brought up.</p>
<p>This cannot help but make one feel that Wu Yanren and Li Boyuan had admirable qualities. Although they were both members of the feudal intellectual class, born in the old era, they fully understood the importance of ballad literature. Li Boyuan wrote a six-volume "Ballad of the Boxer Rebellion," which not only opened up a new path of social significance for ballad novels, which had always limited their subject matter to romantic love affairs, but also became the first book of anti-imperialist literature in China in the field of ballads. Although Wu Yanren did not write anything in this regard, he left us with some opinions. In the seventh issue of the second volume of the new novel "Xiaoshuo Conghua," published in the thirty-first year of the Guangxu reign of the Qing Dynasty, there is a section in which he discusses "Ballad Novels," saying:</p>
<p>"Ballad scripts, etc., are called 'wooden fish books' by the Cantonese. Although these wooden fish books are all fabricated and unfounded, their main purpose is to narrate stories of loyalty, filial piety, chastity, and righteousness. Even when telling the story of a prostitute, it must be said that she died for her lover. Other things, such as righteous servants who are executed in place of their masters, and filial daughters who sell themselves to redeem their fathers, are all found at the beginning of the book, and there is nowhere where they are not found, and they must all have a very good ending. Women and girls, who are accustomed to reading these books, are thus secretly educated. It is a pity that these wooden fish books are limited to local dialects and cannot be spread far and wide."</p>
<p>Although Wu Yanren was unable to make a very good assessment of the literary value of ballad novels, he was very clear about the great social influence of such works. He did not condescendingly despise this type of work.</p>
<p>In the printed editions of ballads, almost every one has a preface explaining the great importance of ballads to customs and human hearts, and the large number of listeners and readers. Wu Yanren's views can be taken as representative, except that he discarded the part that "can dispel boredom and alleviate worries." Therefore, the purpose of the emergence of ballad novels is more blatant and unified than that of other types of popular literature, using a musical form to expand the influence of feudal morality. Also, because of this "too unified" reason, all ballad novels inevitably become a type of stereotyped work. Wu Yanren's words also touched on this point.</p>
<p>What are the literary values of ballad novels? According to Xi Di's opinion: "The narration and description in ballads are much more skillful than in popular biographies and the Romance of Sui and Tang Dynasties; even compared to the Red Chamber Dream and the Golden Lotus, which like to narrate trivial matters, they are even more skilled in describing details and emotions in a subtle and thorough manner. In the past, someone told a joke, saying that listening to someone singing a ballad, describing a woman whose shoelace came undone and bending down to tie it, took one or two nights, and the woman's shoelace was still not tied; this of course contains some ridicule, but the meticulous and profound narration of ballads can be seen from this." This "describing details and emotions in a subtle and thorough manner" does indeed illustrate the characteristics of ballads. However, sometimes the authors of ballads use this method improperly, which damages the literary value of the entire book. For example, in "Why Bother with the West Chamber," using five volumes to write a wedding scene, no matter what, cannot help but make the listeners and readers feel drowsy.</p>
<p>Speaking of "Why Bother with the West Chamber," I am reminded of Tongfeng Waishi's words on "blind ballads," he said: "I don't know when blind ballads began, but there is still a legacy of reciting in a singsong manner. Yuan Qu Cunzhai's poem on passing through Bianliang:</p>
<p>'Blind girls on the street have endless sorrows,</p>
<p>They can strum the pipa and tell the story of the Zhao family,' is the same as 'competing to sing the song of Cai Zhonglang along the street.' Also, Song Lu Fangweng: 'In the Zhao Family Village under the setting sun and ancient willows, a blind old man with a lute is performing.' Blind ballads have been around for a long time. If their new melodies are elegant and can be sung, and they follow the beat like a little Qin King's tune, they are no less than songs written by village schoolteachers in seven-character verse, just to elicit laughter."</p>
<p>This is a historical account of ballad novels, and an explanation of their literary value. Ballad novels, like other literary works, are divided into good and bad depending on the author's cultivation. The best ones move freely between poetry, lyrics, and songs, and are both popular and elegant, and the success of the book "Poetic Hairpin" is one example.</p>
<p>We often divide general novels into long, medium, and short stories, and ballad novels are the same. Xi Di said that some ballad novels are as many as forty volumes, and the trilogy together can exceed seventy volumes. I once saw a manuscript called "Pomegranate Flower Dream," which was as many as three hundred volumes, which can be called the largest work in ballad novels. According to Xi Di, there is a printed edition of this book in Fujian, but I don't know how many volumes the printed book has. Generally, long ballad novels are always over thirty volumes, medium-length ones such as "Heavenly Rain of Flowers" are over ten volumes, and short books such as "Why Bother with the West Chamber" with four, five, seven, or eight volumes, such as "Returning the Golden Gong," can only be considered short stories. In addition, there is a type of "opening chapter," and those contained in "Poetic Hairpin" are only scattered short chapters.</p>
<p>Determined by the stereotyped subject matter and form, ballad novels, like feudal forces, have gradually been heading towards a dead end. Although Li Boyuan tried hard to open up a new direction, and although the September 18th and January 28th incidents also produced some new "opening chapters," in fact, they still could not develop very well. So, where will Chinese ballad novels go in the future? Due to the continuation of inherent influences, there is probably still a need to retain this form and transform it, but in the future, its existence will ultimately be lost, and this is a prediction that anyone can make.</p>
<h3 id="e202">War and Peace <a href="#e202" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c202" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">202</a></h3>
<p>— Hu Yifan</p>
<p>War is a primitive, cruel killing, which is commonly known. From ancient texts and poems, we have already seen many such tragic faces that are shocking. Such as "Elegy for an Ancient Battlefield," and "Pitiful are the bones by the River of Unrest, Still dreaming of their loved ones in spring chambers," "Better to be a dog in times of peace, than a human in times of turmoil," and so on. These popular articles and poems, after reading, will make people clearly think of the scaly white bones in the aftermath of the flames of war, the desolate scenes of destroyed tiles and scorched earth, the sad lives of orphaned widows separated from their loved ones in life and death. All of this will naturally and easily arouse people's feelings of aversion to war, and forget who the creators and instigators of war are. In other words, they have become unaware of why there is war; but when war comes, it gives them only such pain and destruction, so they have no choice but to simply hate war and curse war. Thus, knowing that war is inevitable and will come, but with the knife already at their throats, they still cannot help but fantasize and rave about peace. The same erroneous thought, because of the hatred and pain for war, even sees the normal self-defense war and resistance war of their own people as a sin, as something that should not exist. As an example of the former, we can look at the "praying for peace" and other things that have been popular in the past year or two; as an example of the latter, we can also see the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom of not so distant times, the so-called "rebellious long-haired bandits," which is already a sign.</p>
<p>It is true that war can kill people, but if used well, it can also save people. For example, this type of war, like "better to have one family cry than a whole road cry," is not only necessary, but it must be that fewer people die and more people live, which is worth adopting. Conversely, it is also true that peace can save people, but if the direction is wrong, peace can still kill people. For example, supporting the peace of "why have one family cry when a whole road can cry" is very undesirable; going on with that kind of peace will inevitably lead to very few people living and more people dying. This kind of peace should not only be cursed, but also rejected.</p>
<p>Here, therefore, a kind of understanding is needed: blind anti-war and blind warfare are both insufficient for training. When war comes, the courage to recognize it should precede fear: ask why this war came? For others or for oneself? When the recognition is clear, then one dares to advocate peace, and one will not be blindly deceived and await execution.</p>
<p>Therefore, when talking about anti-war, if the interests truly involve the weaker party themselves, it is not enough to simply pray for peace, but only to use war to stop war, and seek survival from death. Otherwise, one can only "the fittest survive, natural selection," and await execution.</p>

<p>— Zhao Qi</p>
<p>(Part 1)</p>
<p>About twenty of us formed a group and took the streetcar to Shinjuku Station at 8:15. We then bought round-trip tickets for viewing plum blossoms at Yoshino for 1.20 yen and squeezed into the train car with the swarm of tourists. The air was stuffy for a moment. After we settled down, unexpectedly, a continuous drizzle started. People on the train grumbled "dame dame" (meaning "terrible"), but I felt that appreciating plum blossoms in the rain had its own unique charm. However, before long, the heavy, damp air transformed back into patches of clear, sunny clouds.</p>
<p>The Yoshino Plum Orchard is the only famous scenic spot near Tokyo. Every year during the peak bloom season, special trains are arranged for sightseeing. Tourists continuously visit from mid-February until late March. The Japanese have a deep and refined interest in spring outings. Especially the women, they feel ashamed if they lack a beautiful parasol and telescope at this time. Ordinary people gather their families and bring picnic supplies. Elderly scholars often bring writing brushes, inkstones, and wine bottles to search for poetic inspiration.</p>
<p>The local train didn't stop at any station, simply pulling us further into the colors of early spring. After passing Mount Tachikawa, its back covered in lingering snow, the first thing we saw was the ice plum blossoms that I had dreamed of for many years. At this moment, the joyful outline in my heart was just like the faces of those who had just seen the sunny and rainy weather. Hesitantly, at first, one or two trees flashed by, then they gradually became denser, lined up on both sides of the elegant, low houses, coated with a layer of dazzling silver by the sunlight. A warm and soft breeze entered through the window, and people were bathed in the cool fragrance. An old man wearing a red woolen hat in the next seat was surrounded and urged to drink wine, and children were constantly sniffing loudly.</p>
<p>Past here is Qingmei Station. You can walk to the plum orchard after getting off the train. However, the train ticket indicates that there are three places where you can get off and go there, meaning there are still Hinata-Wada and Raku Raku-en stations ahead. In order not to miss any beautiful places, we finally got off at the last station. It seemed that most of the people on the train also got off here. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Night.</p>
<p>The gray-black curtain can cover the moonlight and starlight. Under the dim flashes revealed in the haze, the earth is just a patch of darkness, a hazy scene. After the villagers hastily ate their dinner in the kitchen, they abruptly rushed out the gate and gathered with neighboring brothers to chat leisurely and hopefully throw themselves into the embrace of the vast nature to recuperate their tired bodies. So on the grassy slopes and on the open ground, chairs and stools were placed in twos and threes, and crowds gathered. The night breeze, like the faint breath of a ghost, gently blows across people's dry, haggard faces, showing signs of fatigue.</p>
<p>"Oh... Oh..."</p>
<p>In the midst of people's conversations, occasionally a sorrowful, deep sigh would escape. The melancholy and mournful tone was like the faint breath of an old mill donkey, tired from a full day's work, quietly lying down to rest.</p>
<p>But nature is ultimately benevolent, charitable, and philanthropic to mankind: after a period of quiet rest, people are like the earth turning from darkness to dawn, seemingly endowed with life anew by the Creator, displaying a lively and joyful scene. People temporarily forget their fatigue and chat and laugh cheerfully. The old man recalls the peaceful and prosperous times of the past, earnestly and vividly narrating to the younger generation: how easy it was to live in the past, two copper coins could buy a box of matches, thirty coins could buy a pound of pork, and dozens of coins could let you sit in a tavern for half a day... But now, the world has changed! Pork costs several dimes a pound, matches cost more than ten coins a box, and going to a tavern requires several dimes just to have a little something to eat and drink... In the end, he naturally shakes his head and sighs with emotion: "Each generation is worse than the last. It's really not easy to live..."</p>
<p>"The price of rice has gone up again!"</p>
<p>Suddenly, someone exclaimed in a corner. Upon hearing this, the crowd trembled as if struck by lightning, sighing incessantly. Naturally, they were threatened by this sudden news and worried and saddened about their vague prospects in life.</p>
<p>"What can we do?" They sigh, sigh, sigh deeply, mournfully and hoarsely.</p>
<p>The atmosphere returns to silence. People sit silently and worriedly, like a herd of tired cattle in a waiting room, breathing and sobbing in the boundless darkness. This is the symbol of their lives.</p>

<p>— By Tokunaga Sunao, translated by Ye Yin</p>
<p>In the evening, I definitely read it aloud two or three times for people to hear. The second portion of leftover rice was brought, and the people nearby, like Brother Aji who sells brushes, Brother Achong who buys ashes, Brother A Xiong with one hand, etc., some took the rice back home and then came back; some sat in a row on the door frame, putting the rice and soup together in the wooden bowls with peeling paint that they had left there in advance, eating while listening to me passionately reciting the romance. — This has become their habit.</p>
<p>When I was a fourth-grade student, I was already an expert on romances in the school. I remember once this happened. A male student named Konmatsu, who was very influential in our class, drew a picture of Kato Kiyomasa fighting with Kiyama Danjo and falling off a cliff, showing it off to everyone. However, the class leader of the fifth grade, named Yonemura, spoke up, saying: That's not Kiyama Danjo, but Shiohten Tanba-no-Kami. Since it couldn't be determined whether it was Kiyama Danjo or Shiohten Tanba-no-Kami, Konmatsu's group of about thirty people and Yonemura's group of about twenty-five or six people clashed, arguing that it was Kiyama on one side and Shiohten on the other, each sticking to their own opinions, almost turning into a fight. Therefore, the clever guys in the class skipped class and specially ran to my house to pick me up, saying that they wanted me to be the judge. So, I carried my younger brother as usual, ran to where everyone was, and explained "It's Kiyama Danjo"; and I also explained: Kiyama was originally stronger than Kiyomasa, and Kiyomasa was first pushed to the ground: but when he fell off the cliff, his helmet was entangled by vines, and he took the opportunity to turn over and kill the opponent. Thus, our group won, and everyone supported me and was very happy; but on the way back, when I was alone, I was surrounded by students from Yonemura's group and beaten black and blue.</p>
<p>Brother Xiong with one hand, Brother Afeng with a red cloth around his waist, Brother Aji who sells brushes, Brother Achong who buys ashes, etc., all lived in my house.</p>
<p>These are all people that I can never forget in my life. The older I get, the more clearly I can judge things, the more I can't help but think of these people.</p>

<h3 id="e208">How the Banking Industry Should Respond <a href="#e208" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c208" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">208</a></h3>
<p>— Wang Yutong</p>
<p>Since the economic circles of various countries have been deeply affected by the depression, they have all sought ways to relieve and restore the situation. On the one hand, they have striven to find ways to develop externally, so that what is lost here can be compensated for by others; or they have tried to get out of the atmosphere of the depression as soon as possible. In the final analysis, all of this is nothing more than an economic policy of benefiting oneself at the expense of one's neighbors. Unfortunately, China is in the midst of this trend of economic depression. In terms of economy, it lacks the ability to protect itself, so those who are watching around are gathering their sights on us. In the past few years, China has been struggling under the dire economic conditions of successive disasters, rural bankruptcy, and the decline of urban industry and commerce. In addition, it has suffered from the economic exploitation of various countries, such as the cheap dumping of foreign goods, the oppression of Chinese factories by foreign factories in China, and recently the unreasonable auction of the Shenxin No. 7 Factory, which has become a virtual certainty. The destruction of our national industry is now even worse.</p>
<p>Financial capital is the greatest source of material resources for maintaining national survival. Throughout history, in addition to invading China's national industries, various countries have also launched a strong conquest of China's financial capital, which is obvious to all. Just look at the activities of foreign banks in China, which is enough to prove it. According to statistics, there are 25 foreign banks opened in Shanghai, and their power is far greater than that of Chinese banks. Recently, since the United States announced its silver policy, it has actively absorbed Chinese silver. As a result, foreign banks have transferred their silver reserves overseas, causing the Chinese financial market to suddenly experience currency contraction, triggering a credit panic, and financial turmoil has followed. Under this kind of situation, China itself is declining economically, and its industry and commerce are not prosperous. It is impossible to remedy the extraordinary situation through the adjustment of international trade. It must be that Chinese banks purchase silver from overseas and return to Shanghai, such as the recent Financial Committee ordering silver bars from London and shipping them back to replenish its reserves. There is really no other way. The foreign banks in China are planning to take the opportunity to further absorb silver: (1) Each bank is increasing the interest rate for its original depositors. This is contrary to the low-interest rate policy of absorbing deposits that foreign banks have always adopted. In the past, the deposit interest rate of foreign banks was generally only 1 or 2 li. When the war in Jiangsu and Zhejiang broke out, ignorant wealthy merchants generally changed their cash deposits to foreign banks. At that time, each bank charged a storage fee because there were too many deposits. In recent years, it is difficult to count the huge profits that each foreign bank has made by taking advantage of this abnormal phenomenon. However, since the rise in overseas silver prices in recent years, each foreign bank has had to resort to absorbing deposits in order to use Chinese silver to transport it abroad to obtain greater benefits. However, with the passage of time, China's economic situation and the economic knowledge of the people may be slightly different from the past. Therefore, they use the sweet bait of raising interest rates as an inducement tool. (2) If only raising interest rates as bait is not enough to absorb a large amount of cash, then it must rely on restoring the issuance of banknotes to complement each other. Recently, the HSBC, Mercantile Bank, Yokohama Specie Bank, and Zhengjin Bank in Shanghai, led by HSBC, have agreed to restore the banknote issuance policy. According to recent statistics, the new banknotes issued by HSBC have reached more than 10 million yuan. Other banks, such as Citibank, are also rushing to make new banknotes and preparing to issue them. The most important thing for a bank to issue banknotes is to have sufficient reserves. In the past, the reason why the banknotes issued by foreign banks won the trust of the general public was largely due to their sufficient reserve funds. Taking the statistics of January 23 as an example, HSBC Bank had 83.921 million yuan in silver reserves, Mercantile Bank had 72.469 million yuan in silver reserves, Zhengjin Bank had 20.209 million yuan in silver reserves, Taiwan Bank had 7.536 million yuan in silver reserves, and Citibank had 25.551 million yuan in silver reserves. It is estimated that the issuance of banknotes is less than 2% of the silver reserves. However, the situation this year is very different. According to the statistics of January, HSBC's silver reserves have decreased to 3.723 million yuan, Mercantile's silver reserves have decreased to 1.9 million yuan, Zhengjin's silver reserves have decreased to 3.39 million yuan, Taiwan's silver reserves have decreased to 3.688 million yuan, and Citibank's silver reserves have decreased to 8.006 million yuan. Compared with the same period last year, HSBC alone has decreased by 80.198 million yuan. It is beyond doubt that this significant decrease in reserves must be due to a large amount of exports. However, the bank's reserve funds are dwindling, and the bargaining chips are insufficient. Once an accident occurs, it will affect the bank's credit. Therefore, in order to prevent any eventuality, foreign banks are trying to restore banknotes in order to attract a huge amount of cash, which can be used to replenish reserves and can be exported again. Killing two birds with one stone, there is no better plan than this.</p>
<p>Today, however, our financial industry is in an unprecedentedly serious period. If we do not unite and deal with the economic invasion of foreign banks carefully, the disaster will not only destroy the monetary credit and good phenomena that our financial community has worked so hard to create over the years, but will also allow foreign banks to restore their former dominance over Chinese banks and the advantages that foreign currencies have gained in the market, which is even more dangerous. Therefore, for the sake of the future, I believe that (1) we should first adopt the bank merger policy adopted during the Japanese financial panic. Small banks with weak capital and unstable foundations should merge and reorganize with each other according to their similar natures in order to concentrate capital and unify goals, so as to consolidate the credit system. (2) Each bank should take on the responsibility of promoting domestic goods and supporting industry and commerce. The general public should absolutely trust domestic banks under the leadership of bankers in order to maintain the reputation of domestic banknotes. (3) Hiding one's illness for fear of treatment is a great taboo for people. In the past, the problem with China's financial industry was that it was self-sufficient. As the saying goes, "Sweep the snow in front of your own door and don't care about the frost on other people's roofs." Therefore, it was easily taken advantage of by foreign forces and destroyed its own defenses. In recent years, people in our industry have deeply realized the mistakes of the past and are working together to correct them. If we can pay attention to sound organization and orderly steps in the future, then the way to deal with it lies in this! March 16, 24th year, in Peiping</p>
<h3 id="e209">The Decline and Future of the Native Bank Industry <a href="#e209" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c209" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">209</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Xiaochen</p>
<p>I.</p>
<p>Not long ago, the native banks in Wuxing, because they owed money to the Suzhou native banks, were unable to repay it for a while, and their counterparts jointly published a notice of disassociation in the newspaper. I think everyone still knows about this unprecedented tragedy. Isn't this the beginning of the decline of the native bank industry? Originally, the Chinese native bank industry has a long history, so it also has a considerable reputation and status in society, and it is also full of deep impressions. Its mission is to regulate the financial surplus and deficiency of various industries, so it is closely related to all aspects of society, from production to consumers. Therefore, the rise and fall of the native bank industry must shift with the rise and fall of the entire social economy; it is by no means something that one person can revitalize or something that can be expanded temporarily. Everyone knows that Wuxing is the center of China's silk area, so in recent years, Chinese silk has plummeted as a result of the economic encroachment of the great powers. Wherever sericulture is popular, it will naturally suffer the most serious damage first. The native banks in Wuxing, being in the midst of it, could not withstand the blow from their Suzhou counterparts. Under their weak capabilities, they could not avoid being in a state of financial embarrassment. How could their credit to the outside world not declare bankruptcy? As a result, some collapsed, some stopped, and out of the fourteen counterparts, only one was left to continue operating in the midst of encirclement. This kind of miserable situation, although not an isolated incident, has created a serious situation, which no one can deny. Therefore, shocking news followed one after another: such as the twelve native banks in Jiaxing, in addition to successively closing down, three more went bankrupt last autumn, resulting in other banks successively suspending business. Four native banks in Haiyan were completely stranded in one year. Only one of the more than 20 native banks in Changzhou was left to support the remnants. Nine of the 18 native banks in Wuxi were left, five of the more than 30 in Zhenjiang were left, and eight of the 17 in Pinghu were left. As for the native banks in Chongde, Xiashi, Hangzhou, Changxing, Shaoxing, Qingpu, Suzhou, Danyang and other places, there has hardly been a place that has not decreased in recent years. And it is not only the silk area that is like this, but also the native banks in Tongzhou, Yangzhou, Bengbu, and even Hankou, which is the commercial center of Central China, have also suffered the same fate, with some collecting accounts, some clearing, and all falling off the stage. And the native banks in Anqing were completely shut down. In Kaifeng, the closure of the Xinchang Bank caused the industry to suffer at the same time, leading to financial turmoil. Moreover, Xinchang branches were set up in seven provinces: Shandong, Jiangsu, Hubei, Henan, Shaanxi, Hebei, and Shanxi, so the impact was even greater. After the Yijusheng Bank collapsed in Jinan, Chengdehou continued to close down, and the news spread throughout the city. In Xuzhou, the grounding of the Gongyu Bank caused the banknotes of private pawnshops to suddenly be squeezed, resulting in a storm in the financial world. In Guangzhou, the collapse of the banks continued one after another, causing people's hearts to fluctuate and banknotes to plummet. And the scene in Shantou is even more dangerous. Although the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and others have tried their best to maintain it, the stability of the market cannot be achieved by a cup of water and a load of firewood. As a result, the credit of the banks has fallen even further. After the three banks of Chen Yuanda and others, who were known as the backbone members, closed down due to the wave, the three banks of Guangfa and others followed suit. How can the situation of financial panic become more and more intense? Finally, Jiafa and Guangxingchang and other banks also announced their closure in this scene. Such a situation of following the trend can be said to be like the wind blowing grass! Recently, in Fuzhou, Tianjin, Tangshan, Peiping, and Taiyuan, the source of pawnshops, many banks have been unable to stand firm and have successively announced their closure. And Xiamen, which is in the midst of a sharp drop in real estate prices, collapsed three major native banks known for their strong capital in one week, causing the financial community to feel precarious. Even Shanghai, which is known as the best area in the country, no matter how you embellish it with gold and jade, after all, in this time of crisis everywhere, Shanghai, although prosperous, cannot be compared with the other paradise of the pastoral poet Tao Jingjie, where "the old and the young are happy and at ease." Therefore, the native banks in Shanghai cannot avoid the disaster. In the 17th year of the Republic of China, the number of banks in the north and south markets reached 87, which can be said to be a scene of thousands of atmospheres, and it was the most prosperous year since the Republic of China. Or perhaps the saying that prosperity must decline is just the time to give it its authority, so the Shanghai native banks after the 17th year of the Republic of China are like a thermometer that has no ability to resist the pressure of the cold and gradually shrinks: only 84 in the 18th year of the Republic of China, only 78 in the 19th year of the Republic of China, only 72 in the 21st year of the Republic of China, and only 68 in the 22nd year of the Republic of China. It is not said that at the end of last year, unfortunately, the financial turmoil suddenly expanded, and the four banks of Baodayu and others were sacrificed as a result; then four more were announced to be liquidated, so only 57 banks were listed this spring, compared with the 17th year of the Republic of China, it has decreased by more than one-third. In this way, the native bank industry today is shaking in the east and withering in the west. The declining scene has the same picture of a hundred holes and thousands of sores. Of course, this kind of unbearable picture is not Tang Yin's "Tiger" or Zhao Zixu's "Horse", which can be used for the entertainment of the leisure class. We should see that behind this picture, there is extremely vivid rendering: what about rural bankruptcy? Is industry and commerce dying? Is the unemployment panic serious? And the concentration of capital? And even the plummeting of prices? The stagnation of real estate, etc.? Shocking, appalling, sad and tearful scars, anyone with a heart will sigh in unison when they see it!</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>A country has its own financial center, and a place also has its own financial center. In the past and even now, wasn't the native bank industry grasping the financial center of various places in China? Therefore, the establishment of native banks in various places is very common; perhaps because society needs this kind of financial organization very much. Moreover, under the immutable law, the standpoint of the native bank industry has always maintained the so-called ethical institutions such as taking righteousness as profit inherited from a certain era, so whether it is to people or to oneself, it is based on credit. This is the characteristic of the Chinese native bank industry, and it is also catering to the psychology of the Chinese people. Especially for the decent merchants under the traditional idea of "everyone wants face and trees want bark," they dare not take it lightly and absolutely do not want others to despise them in order to maintain their reputation, because it is related to business gains and losses, and they always take credit as a prerequisite. The native bank industry can have such conditions, so it has had the opportunity for sound development in the past.</p>
<p>Now? The decline of the native bank industry is an undeniable fact. The glory of the past is just a historical trace! Therefore, isn't the reason for the decline worthy of careful understanding? In the past, the growth of the native bank industry was based on the word "credit," which means "people cannot stand without credit." So, isn't the general credit contraction in the country in recent years a fatal injury that has forced the native bank industry to take the wrong path? (To be continued)</p>
<h3 id="e210">Domestic Bonds in the Last Three Years <a href="#e210" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c210" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">210</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Heling</p>
<p>Our country's industry and commerce have been hit hard by the September 18th Incident, almost to the point of collapse. Domestic bonds have also been deeply affected, with the prices of various bonds plummeting by tens of dollars. In the 21st year [1932], the January 28th Shanghai Incident occurred, the situation became serious, and the market was closed for as long as three months. The bond market lost its liquidity, the financial system became stagnant, and there was a risk of fundamental upheaval. Bondholders and the financial authorities negotiated to reorganize domestic debt, proposing measures to reduce interest rates and extend the repayment period. The securities market then reopened in May. Initially, prices were low, but because the interest earned was still around two percent per month, investors took advantage of the low prices to buy in, and the bond market rose steadily. However, due to the precarious situation and the lack of a proper resolution to the issues with Japan, and with heavy clouds in the international situation, investors hesitated, and speculators were also wary. The market sentiment was depressed, and transactions were reduced. The total transaction volume for the year was only 901,710,000 yuan, a decrease of 2,439,290,000 yuan compared to the 3,341,000,000 yuan in the 20th year [1931]; in other words, less than one-third of the volume of the 20th year. Price fluctuations were also more moderate, with the average difference between the highest and lowest discounts being 23.217%, only half of the average difference of 42.94% in the 20th year. By the 22nd year [1933], border alerts were frequent, Yuguan fell, Rehe was lost, and the flames of war were raging; however, the bond market thrived, because in recent years, the rural economy had collapsed, the inland areas were bankrupt, and cash from all over the country was concentrated in Shanghai. For a time, there was an abundance of idle capital in the city, with no avenues for investment. Everyone regarded bonds as the last resort, and the amount of negotiable securities was lacking, so prices rose accordingly. Later, the Tanggu Truce was signed, signaling a temporary end to the conflict with Japan. In addition, former Finance Minister Song's successful cotton and wheat loan in the United States greatly boosted morale, and bond prices soared. This firmness lasted for several months. In November, Song resigned and was replaced. In December, a rebellion broke out in Fujian Province, creating disturbances, and the bond market weakened. Fortunately, the Fujian rebellion was quickly suppressed, morale was good, and the slump was like a flash in the pan, and soon recovered. Trading was quite brisk that year. The total par value for the year was 3,219,955,000 yuan, an increase of 2,318,245,000 over the 21st year. The average price discount also increased by 9.13% compared to the 21st year. From January to August of the 23rd year [1934], the bond market was always under the control of the bulls, prospering and reaching its peak for a time. New high prices emerged one after another, almost every month. Although the Tibet Treasury incident caused a temporary slump, prices rebounded after it was safely recovered. By August, it had reached its peak. The discounts on various bonds were all above 75%, with the 9th Customs and the 9th Rehabilitation bonds nearly reaching 85%, and the interest rate was only around 0.7% per month. This led to selling by those with physical bonds. In addition, the United States raised silver prices, causing an outflow of silver, the foreign exchange rate rose, and credit tightened. The bond market gradually weakened, and the downward trend continued for several months. By December, the foreign exchange rate had soared and credit had become extremely tight, a rare occurrence in recent years. Banks urged the redemption of collateral loans and refused to conduct arbitrage transactions, cutting off the flow of capital to the bulls, which caused panic. Everyone sold off bonds, and the negotiable securities were crowded. The prices for the next month were inverted, and the predicament of the bulls was evident. The market was bleak, and it was difficult to recover. However, the average discount for the whole year was still better than that of the 22nd year by 12.656%, and the transaction volume was also very brisk. The comparative table of average discounts over the past three years, the comparative table of highest and lowest discounts, and the table of the proportion of delivered transaction amounts are listed below:</p>

<p>Total	115,220	136,055	83,565</p>
<p>From observing the above table, the following points are noteworthy:</p>
<p>(1) Bond prices have been steadily rising over the past three years. The 22nd year was 9.13% higher than the 21st year, and the 23rd year was 12.65% higher than the 22nd year, and 21.786% higher than the 21st year. The bond with the largest price increase was the 18th Customs, with an increase of 24.405%, and the smallest increase was the 9th Customs, with as much as 18.885%. (See Table 1)</p>
<p>(2) The highest discounts over the years have all been for the 18th Customs, at 69.58% in the 21st year, 81.15% in the 22nd year, and 89.25% in the 23rd year (See Table 2), because the repayment period of this bond is approaching and there are fewer negotiable securities.</p>
<p>(3) The lowest discounts over the years have all been for the Reorganization 6% Bonds. At 26% in the 21st year, 34.20% in the 22nd year, and 45.70% in the 23rd year (See Table 2), because the bond only pays interest, and the redemption of principal by lottery will not be made until 1936.</p>
<p>(4) The largest difference in the 21st year was for the 18th Customs, at 25.18%. In the 22nd year, it was for the 9th Customs, at 29.64%. In the 23rd year, it was for the Disarmament Bonds, at 30.05%. (See Table 2)</p>
<p>(5) The smallest difference in the 21st year was for the Reorganization 6% Bonds, at 20.60%. In the 22nd year, it was for the Disarmament Bonds, at 25.45%. In the 23rd year, it was for the 23rd Customs, at only 8.58%. (See Table 2)</p>
<p>(6) The largest fluctuations in the bond market during the three years were in the 22nd year, at 27.129%, followed by the 23rd year, and the smallest in the 21st year. (See Table 2)</p>
<p>(7) The transaction volume was the highest in the 23rd year, 1,251,640,000 yuan more than the 22nd year, and as much as 3,869,885,000 yuan more than the 21st year. The total transaction volume of the 21st and 22nd years was not even equal to that of the 23rd year alone. The prosperity of the market can be seen. (See Table 3)</p>
<p>(8) The number of deliveries does not increase with the increase in the number of transactions, and the proportion decreases year by year. This is enough to prove that speculation is rampant and investment is small. Although the appearance seems firm, the underlying reality is weak. (See Table 5)</p>
<p>The high bond market is not so much a reflection of the prosperity of the financial sector, but rather a reflection of the unsoundness of our country's economy. The booming market is just a kind of abnormal state of reflected glory. Because inland cash is concentrated in Shanghai, and investment avenues are extremely narrow, everyone flocks to the buying and selling of bonds. When silver exports and credit suddenly tightened, physical bonds were sold. Therefore, the prosperity of bonds depends entirely on the overall economic shift. Over the past three years, the rise and fall of domestic prices have been less affected by political threats and more by economic control. When Rehe was lost and North China was in a serious state, bonds rose steadily. By the end of the 23rd year, foreign relations were becoming increasingly harmonious, the suppression of bandits had been successful, and the opinions of the central government and the southwest were gradually converging. The environment was good and people's hearts were stable, but the bond market was lifeless and weak, for no other reason than the fact that it was controlled by the economy.</p>

The transaction of discount bills was brisk in the morning market at 3 million, and the small general association traded over 600,000.

<h3 id="e212">Securities: Bond Market Fluctuates Like Waves Last Week <a href="#e212" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c212" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">212</a></h3>
<p>Last week (March 18th to 23rd) was the last week of March futures trading at the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange. It happened to coincide with many events, and the market price fluctuated greatly. In Europe, there was Germany's military preparation. In this city, there was first the real estate developer's proposed 50 million yuan of circulating notes, followed by the exchange of 2,000 10,000-yuan notes for 1,000-yuan notes in the 22nd Customs, which suddenly increased the floating negotiable securities by 20 million. The 100 million financial bonds were about to be implemented, which would increase the capital of the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications, activate the market, and the 5 million syndicate loan was also about to be implemented. The market price was uncertain. Recently, due to the approaching settlement date, the price rise and fall depended only on the imbalance in the supply and demand of negotiable securities between the bulls and bears, and fluctuated from time to time, which was not the standard for rising and falling. On Monday and Tuesday, there were the above-mentioned factors, and there was a lot of short covering and bull exiting in the market. Big players also sold, and the market price dropped by a small half a yuan or so each day. On Wednesday, the rumor of circulating notes was invisibly eliminated, the short covering was made up, and the price rebounded unanimously by 3, 5, and 7 jiao or so. On Thursday, the 100 million financial bonds had been decided, and the market price fell again by 3, 5 jiao. On Friday, the short position rolled over and made up, and rebounded by 3, 4 jiao. On Saturday, there was still hope for foreign loans, and the 5 million syndicate loan was about to be established. Suddenly, there were big players buying in and covering short positions in the market, resulting in the abnormal situation of the near-term rising and the distant-term falling. In summary, the results of the market price for a week were quite chaotic, with mostly falling and less rising. Among them, there was still a phenomenon of near-high and far-low, the number was only between 5 fen, 1 jiao to 6, 7 jiao. The total transaction volume was 80,002,700 yuan. The results of the price increase and decrease are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was quite active. At the opening, both buyers and short sellers were very strong, so the market price did not fluctuate much from the previous day. Later, there was a lack of important buyers in the market, and at the same time, Wall Street was weak. Brokers cleared bullish positions, and foreign merchants sold, so the price gradually declined. When the price fell, the industry bought in slightly. The closing was flat. Spot prices fell by 10 points, and futures prices fell by 3 to 10 points. British cotton rose following American cotton. Speculators and the industry both purchased. Spot prices rose by 13 points, and futures prices rose by 13-14 points. Indian cotton was firm due to public buying. Bengal rose by 4.5 rupees, Oomra rose by 5.75 rupees, and Broach rose by 4.25 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (telegram on the 23rd):</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, arrivals from various sources totaled only about twenty, with a cargo of nearly four thousand piculs. Most were of low-grade paddy rice. Both retail and wholesale markets remained sluggish, and the situation showed little sign of improvement. Fortunately, the supply of Suchow ordinary rice was stable. Early rice prices were high at the opening but weakened later. However, more low-grade paddy rice arrived. Only the Longkou gang handled over two hundred packages. Prices fell slightly, by a few cents to about a dime. Dujian also showed signs of softening, while Yinyuan continued to decline by a dime.</p>

Sales in the market were normal. The market price of white rice was similar to the previous day. However, the price of top-grade Yangjian had risen due to a previous shortage, but as sales were slow, the price dropped back by a dime. White ordinary rice also showed signs of weakness.</p>

<h3 id="e217">Textiles: Domestic "Huada Ne" Fabric Sells Exceptionally Well - Imports of Foreign Goods Decline Annually - <a href="#e217" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c217" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">217</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the trade in woolens remained brisk, with prices showing little fluctuation. However, the sales of Huada Ne and similar fabrics have decreased recently. Imports last year were more than half of what they were in 1933. Furthermore, colors and patterns have changed, and domestic products are well-made. Currently, the most popular items are plain Yuan Chang and gray, followed by mixed colors. The plaid and striped Huada Ne fabrics that were popular in the past are now outdated. Twill and dotted Ne fabrics also have very limited sales. Old-style mixed-color Ne fabrics with slight embellishments for shoe uppers are not often stocked by wool shops. Red, green, and iridescent Ne fabrics have long been eliminated. Therefore, this spring, only plain and mixed-color Ne fabrics have arrived, while other varieties are completely absent. Domestic products from the Da Long and Zhang Hua factories, such as Yuan Chang and gray plain Huada Ne fabrics, have good sales, which has slightly impacted foreign goods. Plain Huada Ne fabrics sell quickly as clothing materials for street-front shops, mostly sold to out-of-town customers and Western-style clothing shops. Prices are on average thirty to forty cents cheaper per yard than last year.</p>

<h3 id="e218">More on Confucius's Revisiting the New World <a href="#e218" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c218" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">218</a></h3>
<p>— Donghong</p>
<p>In the previous edition of this publication, Mr. "Spring Rain's" article "Confucius's Revisiting the New World" was published. It was quite interesting to read, but the title is "Confucius's Revisiting the New World," while the tone of the article is not "revisiting the New World" at all, which makes it seem like the content doesn't match the title. Therefore, I am also borrowing Mr. Spring Rain's theme to express my humble opinion, which may be approved by Mr. Spring Rain.</p>
<p>Confucius was originally known for enjoying traveling. No matter who invited him, the old man always gladly accepted and never refused. Even the rebellious ministers Gongshan Furao sent someone to invite Confucius, and Confucius even wanted to go, but Zilu blocked him, so he ultimately did not go. Another rebel minister, Fufan, also once sent someone to invite Confucius, and Confucius also wanted to go, but Zilu blocked him again. Although Confucius grumbled a bit, he ultimately did not go. Moreover, in the countries Confucius visited, he only stopped by at the homes of a few acquaintances, such as Ju Boyu in the State of Wei and Sicheng Zhenzi in the State of Qi, who were his old patrons. No one ever built a "Confucius Mansion" to invite him to live there. Therefore, Confucius may not object to Japan's invitation this time.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Confucius often joked around with women. Nanzi, the wife of Duke Ling of Wei, sent someone to express her desire to see Confucius. Confucius met her, with the woman behind a curtain and Confucius outside the curtain, seeing each other through the curtain. Confucius entered, facing north and bowing, while the woman bowed twice from behind the curtain, with the jingling sounds of jade ornaments. Nanzi was originally a well-known socialite in the State of Wei. Therefore, Zilu, who was known for his simplicity, was very unhappy when he heard about this. Confucius hurriedly and solemnly declared, "Don't misunderstand. If I have any irregular thoughts, may Heaven abandon me. I can swear an oath in front of you." Last time, when the League of Nations investigation team visited Japan, Japan held a grand dance party, with powdered faces and green eyebrows everywhere, and the guests and hosts all enjoyed themselves. Assuming that Confucius goes to Japan this time, Japan will also treat him exceptionally well and hold a welcoming meeting. I think Confucius will also dance with his hands and feet, just like hearing the Shao music, and forget the taste of meat for three months.</p>
<p>Confucius was a connoisseur of treasures and an archaeologist. Therefore, he had a lot of research on antiques and art. Thus, Confucius once inquired about rituals from Lao Peng and learned to play the zither from Shi Xiang. Therefore, he liked to travel to various countries to increase his knowledge. Therefore, like Tang Sanzang going to the Western Buddhist Kingdom to obtain scriptures, he encountered many tribulations on the road, being rejected by Qi, expelled from Song and Wei, and trapped between Chen and Cai. However, Confucius still wanted to travel, planning to see Zhao Jianzi in the west. Upon hearing of the deaths of Dou Mingdu and Shun Hua in Awen, he lamented by the river, saying, "How beautiful is the water, so vast! It is fate that I cannot cross this river." Because he did not achieve his goal of going to Jin this time, he was very frustrated. Therefore, traveling to various countries was Confucius's favorite thing in his life. However, Confucius was not always welcomed wherever he went, and he was even driven away by people. Now that Confucius has been dead for a long time, there is only a wooden tablet. What does it matter where it goes? Therefore, no matter who wants to invite him, Confucius will definitely not object and will not cause any problems. Moreover, he himself said, "Qiu is a person of the east, west, south, and north." Therefore, he ran around his whole life and suffered a lot, but he did not regret it. Now, taking airplanes, trains, and ships to travel to various countries is truly getting what he wanted.</p>
<h3 id="e219">The Spring of Yushe Mountain <a href="#e219" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c219" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">219</a></h3>
<p>— Chunhui</p>
<p>It is spring, and life's laughter rises on Yushe Mountain. The sea makes a turn from Mazu Island, surrounding the Shantou Peninsula. Yushe Mountain stands opposite the city, rising up with the laughter of spring towards the city and the sea.</p>
<p>Ships of all sizes crowd densely in the bay. The spring sea only raises slight waves. The sun shines brightly on the water surface, and the shadows of the sails are dragged into large, black tails. The golden color of the sun reflects on the blue seawater</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>reflecting onto the slopes of Yushe Mountain.</p>
<p>Many wooden boats cross the small sea journey daily, carrying guests between Shantou and Yushe Mountain. Steamships stir up waves, and the wooden boats sway, emitting sounds of oars.</p>
<p>From the peak of Yushe Mountain, the entire view of the sea is captured. The dense houses of Shantou City and the rows of giant buildings in front of the customs office are all revealed. The upper layers of the city are permeated with smoke, and the noise of the city can be heard across the sea. However, the fort at the mouth of the sea reveals its ugly and dark face, which is especially frightening in spring. Juxtaposed with the gentle face of the green mountain, it appears even more disharmonious.</p>
<p>Tender grass is green on the mountain, covering the paths. The red coffins in the Westerners' cemetery shine with a copper color in the spring. The cemetery is clean and full of wildflowers, and those who sleep there rest peacefully underground. Western-style houses are scattered on the mountain, with windows facing the sea. There are also small thatched cottages, whose humble appearance is covered by the warmth of spring.</p>
<p>The schools and dormitories on the mountainside often broadcast laughter. The sounds of balls are noisy on the sports fields, and young people display the vitality of youth.</p>
<p>In the morning and evening, foreigners often stroll the mountain paths with slender-waisted women. On sunny afternoons, there are also tourists coming across the sea, their neat Western clothes often matching silk cheongsams. In the very early morning, students run around in the mountains with nimble bodies.</p>
<p>Whenever small foreign warships are anchored in the sea, groups of two or three sailors, dressed in sailor uniforms, drill in the mountains. Occasionally, some fishermen step heavily in the mountains with firm strides.</p>
<p>Consuls tread with the affected gait of foreign gentlemen, while young female students, in simple tops and pleated skirts, walk with natural and lively lightness.</p>
<p>Looking behind from Yushe Mountain, the vast plain reveals green fields. Many small villages are sparsely scattered among the fields, with small houses gathered in piles. Groves of trees surround the villages, creating dividing lines with the boundless green fields.</p>
<p>Rivers flow smoothly on both sides of Yushe Mountain. From the mountain, the red color of the water looks like a red cloth belt. Mazu Island tightens its narrow mouth, and the sea water looks like a large pond. During high and low tides, the surging sea tide is as majestic as soldiers charging into battle.</p>
<p>Moonlit nights on Yushe Mountain in spring are even more exceptionally gentle and beautiful. The noise of the city is separated by a thin sea, and here it is as quiet as nature taking a nap. Moonlight shines all over the mountains, and poetic sentiments flow on every stone and every piece of soil. The residents of Yushe Mountain sleep in the moonlight, and it is easier to have sweet dreams than in other places.</p>
<p>In spring, the mountains laugh, and the sea laughs; the red flowers are shy, and the green grass is charming;… people wake up from the cold of winter and smile at the sea, the mountains, the flowers, and the grass.</p>
<p>The whole spring of Yushe Mountain is filled with laughter!</p>
<h3 id="e220">Spring Field Scenery <a href="#e220" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c220" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">220</a></h3>
<p>— Qin Jian</p>
<p>(The warm March sun slowly, like a divine miracle, drifts down from page to page of the calendar. People seem to have a little awakening from their comatose or decadent desires: we remember: it's spring.)</p>
<p>It is spring. The depressed world of humanity is forever greedily seeking the next new stimulus in its wild abandon. Therefore, when the red and the smiles have lost their stimulation in their cloying familiarity, everyone shouts frantically: It is spring, let's go to the fields, let's go to the fields!</p>
<p>(-Let's go to the countryside, let's go to the countryside to see the spring!</p>
<p>-Isn't it? Cities are damned, there is no spring or autumn in the cities – stupid cow!</p>
<p>-Daddy, darling, I'm so glad, I haven't seen the simplicity of the country people in this green life. I think it must be very lovely - I've seen those poetic descriptions in Hardy's rural novels.</p>
<p>-Yes, darling.)</p>
<p>Following the drift of the gentlemen's cigars, the express train clenches the tracks and rushes forward: red flowers and green weeds are already the spring countryside!</p>
<p>Is it true that the fields are as beautiful as poetry, even as the metropolis presents a shaky year?</p>
<p>People, following the warming of the climate, gradually increase; scattered in clusters in all directions, listening to the cunning tongue of the wild lark, listening to the flow of the stream, listening to the sound of a clock in the dusk, and finally, they also listen to the heavy sigh that fills the fields.</p>
<p>Since the beginning of spring, even the grain shops in the small towns have closed their doors one after another. The local bullies who usually strut on the streets, with their clothes unbuttoned, and who flirt with women, have fallen into even more dire straits, because the tea houses have closed and the gambling stalls have long been empty - people have become empty shells, what is there to gamble on?</p>
<p>And, on the other hand, following the decline of the townships, the people in the fields also pour out their melancholy of the troubled times into the open fields: panic, hunger; and the sighs of the elderly and the resentment of the young woven into the transition of the times.</p>
<p>The lack of something to fill the stomach is the most terrible thing. Last year was a drought, what is there to be happy about this spring? At home: the young lads have all drifted away, not knowing where they have gone. Around the Qingming Festival, the cemeteries everywhere are still deserted, you don't see the flying paper ash, and you don't hear the moving cries of the young widows. In this year, the dead are much happier than the living. Besides: even people can't take care of themselves, how can they take care of the dead ghosts, ha!</p>
<p>A kind of melancholy tune crosses the fields; nature stubbornly follows the discipline of the seasons: it is spring, and it still hangs up the flower buds and the tiny grass leaves: but when people are worried about the next meal, who still yearns for those worthless flowers and grasses?</p>
<p>But, finally, there are some people who come from a strange place - from the metropolis, who, in their smiling faces and gold-rimmed glasses, appreciate those flowers and grasses that are neglected by others. Spring is the golden age of Mother Nature, spring lives in the suburbs!</p>
<p>(Red butterflies, yellow butterflies, fly away like fallen flowers, swirling in the fields is a kind of indelible brown melancholy, like dark clouds before a big thunderstorm, which makes people suffocate!)</p>
<p>Three days, a week, someone in the first-class carriage of the spring tour train is thinking:</p>
<p>"The spring in the fields is not as lovely as the poets describe."</p>
<h3 id="e221">Shicha Lake <a href="#e221" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c221" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">221</a></h3>
<p>— Juefu</p>
<p>I spent a large portion of my days by this lakeside with a strong earthy smell, and I buried all my refreshing mornings and dim dusks in its embrace. I am very clear about what its true face is like.</p>
<p>There, no matter which refreshing day it is, there will always be small birds jumping and singing on the willows, white pigeons circling in the sky, occasionally emitting哇哇... whistle sounds; old men carrying bird cages, pacing back and forth under the willow shade, strong men carrying baskets and nets, netting fish in the small river by the lake, farmers and farm women wearing straw hats and carrying hoes, working hard in the fields... people who are placed here will forget that they are living in a metropolis with one or two million people. When the evening mist gradually descends, the crows returning from their tired travels, fill the sky with red clouds, hovering and clamoring, and teams of gray and white ducks also flap their wings, jump into the clear water, and wander around aimlessly. The blood-red sunset hangs obliquely on the city walls that resemble mountains, and the weeping willows far and near are shrouded in a thin layer of mist; looking through the light mist to the east, standing there is a majestic ancient drum tower and bell tower, covered with a layer of light-colored sunset. At this time, what unfolds before your eyes is not just a wonderful natural group painting?</p>
<p>It was in the severe cold of winter, right? The lotus flowers that rippled on the water surface could not withstand the blowing of the biting cold wind and had long since withered and sunk. At this time, what was spread in the lake was a piece of bright, thick ice bed. The swimming bed has become the only entertainment place for a group of poor families: the children, using their homemade ice skates, are strolling on it; the strong men, pull down their ice boats, (the so-called ice boats are just large tables with two iron bars embedded underneath) carrying guests back and forth on it. For families who cannot afford a pair of ice skates, if they also want to enjoy the taste of skating on the ice, spending four or five copper coins to take an ice boat ride is considered a reward. Once spring arrives, when the ice bed gradually melts into clear water, the strong winds unique to the north blow day and night, and the bare willow stalks occasionally make呼呼呼... cries, and the sea water is like a vast ocean, one wave after another, rolling towards the other shore. Standing on the mound by the lake, looking up at the lake, looking at the willow branches, it will teach people to unconsciously feel like they are about to become immortals. When the spring light is old, the willow leaves gradually become lush green on the branches, and the lotus flowers in the lake also stretch out of the water, swaying in the wind. When the scorching summer sun comes, listening to the clear birdsong, smelling the fragrant lotus fragrance, the clear scenery of so-called warm sun, fish leaping, quiet water surface, light wind, birds singing, cool shade of trees, is now vividly appearing before our eyes. By the time summer goes and autumn comes, the lush green weeping willows are covered with a layer of light yellow outerwear, and the lotus flowers in the lake have long since withered, and the basin-like leaves are also showing signs of withering. If it is a rest day, when a person walks alone on the riverbank with an umbrella, or walks into the tea house by the lake, leaning on the railing to drink alone, then the secluded pleasure of leaving the residual lotus to listen to the rain is now being appreciated.</p>
<p>A place with such a strong rural flavor will never be forgotten in the minds of us country people who are used to living in the city!</p>
<h3 id="e222">Nostalgia <a href="#e222" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c222" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">222</a></h3>
<p>— Yangyang</p>
<p>Memories are like a heavy fog; in loneliness, my mind falls into contemplation again!</p>
<p>Although the surface of the city is prosperous, the state of mind of a wanderer is like a piece of ice; there is never a time when it is warm. Even if there is, it is only temporary.</p>
<p>The spring light seems to be even more brilliant in a few drizzles! The beautiful season makes every heart sink even more into old sweetness.</p>
<p>The taste of first love is like honey. The ancient mountain peaks of Nanhua are the place I cherish the most! Once the plum blossoms withered, people took off their heavy furs and put on light spring clothes.</p>
<p>When the sunset reflects on the decadent branches of the plum blossoms, the sound of the bells of Cangshan reverberates with medieval fantasies. Everyone carries leather-bound books and comes out of the old Western-style buildings; strolling on the tidy mountain road.</p>
<p>The broken shadows of sunlight are filtered through the banyan trees on both sides, stepping on the monument commemorating the restoration; watching a round of rising sun gradually sink westward on the other side of Yushan.</p>
<p>At the second sound of the bell, it floats over from the bell tower again. At this time, a superior-level guard climbs up from the iron ladder. A person with a haggard expression then comes down.</p>
<p>Going down the stone steps of the mountain road, you can see the Minjiang River like a silver chain in the middle. In the rapids of the Jiangnan Bridge, white waves splash everywhere. Walking across the Jiangnan Bridge to an island surrounded by water, this is our home!</p>
<p>On this island, we spent years and years of time flowing like mercury. Watching the prosperity of this small island, this small island also declined with the years of war. At the mouth of the Minjiang River, the imperialist shallow-water ships also devoured the entire prosperity!</p>
<p>It was in a period of great turmoil that I left this mountain valley and water village; it now seems like a long century has passed.</p>
<p>But the news that came back is that this island is even more mired in the vortex of depression. This solid fossil will one day be broken by the big waves!</p>
<p>In my heart, infinite melancholy has increased again.</p>

<p>Opening: "Little Nun Yearns for Worldly Love"</p>
<p>The evening horn rises from the looming city tower. A pretty nun sits alone, sighing sadly. Her life is lost within the empty gates of Buddhism. She resents her parents' poor decision. They listened to the fortune teller from Jianghu, who said that her life was destined for loneliness and isolation. Therefore, they sent her to become a nun. Now, she sleeps alone under the osmanthus-scented canopy. She has reached marriageable age, yet remains unmarried. She thinks that offering candles is not as good as a wedding ceremony. Red skirts and green jackets are better than a cassock. Smashing the wooden fish is useless. The Western Paradise may not have a lotus seat for her. The assembly on Mount Ling has thousands of Buddhas. Can it be that the dragon girl is missing from the ranks? She only sees living people suffering. When have the dead been forced to wear shackles? Everything is fake. Why bother chanting Amitabha all day? She now has a kindred spirit. She is willing to grow her hair and abandon the Buddhist scriptures. Let people criticize her for spinning hemp during the day and weaving yarn at night. Let them call her disheveled and barefoot. It is just that heaven does not grant her wishes. She is like a lone goose falling on the sand. How can she not resent her parents?</p>

<h3 id="e245">A Study of the Names of the Latest Forty Love Films <a href="#e245" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c245" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">245</a></h3>
<p>— Boning</p>
<p>Every Saturday, when I breathe a sigh of relief after leaving the office, the first thing I do is ask people, "Where are you going to see a movie this afternoon?" Especially the author, I like to ask an extra question: "Why are you going there? Why are you going to see that film?" After asking many, many times, asking countless people, their answers can be summarized into only three sentences: "I know that film is good." "The location there is more suitable." "That film seems to be very good."</p>
<p>Regarding the first type, it is due to the high value of the film itself and the merit of film reviews. Because before watching a movie, most people first browse the film reviews of the day, or ask people who have seen it, and then go to see it after knowing the quality of the film. The second type is about the film itself, the price, equipment, and location, which are naturally more attractive. Only the third type of people rely entirely on intuition. They have no preference for theaters, have not read film reviews, and no one has told them that the film is good. They casually see the name of a film in the newspaper, on the roadside advertisement, or even when walking past the theater entrance, and if it appeals to them, they go straight in. Whose merit is this? It's the "film title." The name of a film, like an article or a book, has great value and great magic, so it is also the easiest to move people.</p>
<p>For this reason, the author collected many film titles from February to the present and analyzed and studied them. Among them, the names of domestic films are generally better, with fewer flaws. This is because domestic productions are not easy, and choosing a name is naturally cautious and not taken lightly. As for foreign films, they are much worse. Therefore, this article only focuses on foreign films, but among foreign films, comedies, war films, detective films, and silent films, although there are some materials, are ultimately few in number and not enough for analysis, so it only adopts a portion of "love films." Now, the results of the research are briefly described.</p>
<p>Too much repetition of words and phrases. A total of forty love films were collected this time (film titles omitted). The author analyzed the individual characters among them and found that the most frequent character was "情" (love), appearing thirteen times, accounting for 32.5%; "春" (spring) appeared five times, accounting for 12.5%; "女" (woman) and "風" (wind) each accounted for nine times. Analyzing individual phrases, "春風" (spring breeze) was found twice, and "情史" (love history) was also found twice. If we further analyze similar phrases, then we already have "春風" (spring breeze) and also "春光" (spring light), "春色" (spring color), "春心" (spring heart). We already have "情深" (deep love) and also "多情" (affectionate), "情奔" (love run), "情侶" (lovers), "情種" (love seed), "懺情" (confession of love)...etc. Whether from a psychological perspective or an advertising perspective, such "repetition" is a huge flaw. For example, when "dating," if you keep saying "I love you, I love you, I love you" to your lover, without any variation, will the other party be moved? Will they sympathize with you?</p>
<p>Too many vague phrases... Among these forty films, there is a large pile of vague phrases, such as: "媚月" (charming moon), "春風" (spring breeze), "憐香" (pitying fragrance), "竊玉" (stealing jade), "靈犀" (telepathy)...etc. If you were to stare at a wall with these words like "憐香," "竊玉," "靈犀" arranged side by side, and were asked to choose one, which would you choose and which would you reject? Then how can this large pile attract the audience to succeed?</p>
<p>Too many rigid numbers of characters... Among the forty films this time, thirty-one have names with four characters. This accounts for almost 80% of the total. If we walk into the City God Temple or the Guan Emperor Temple and look up at the four-character plaques arranged there, what do we feel? Don't we just feel that they are "similar," "almost the same," and have no impression other than the temple door? Then what do the movie audiences feel about these neatly arranged film titles?</p>
<p>Because of the above three shortcomings, we often feel that foreign films, especially love films, are all: "irrelevant," all "cold," without passionate feelings, without a fire-like attraction, leading us to appreciate them. This is so unfortunate!</p>
<p>Film Review</p>
<h3 id="e246">Review of "The Gay Bride" <a href="#e246" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c246" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">246</a></h3>
<p>— Hualun</p>
<p>"The Gay Bride" - Showing in Nanjing</p>
<p>The appearance and activity of private thugs and bullies in today's society is more rampant than in the past. This phenomenon also reflects the inherent contradictions, anxieties, and festering knots within this society. Look, especially in so-called modern civilized metropolises, or political centers, commercial centers, the actions of these tycoons among private thugs and bullies are revealed daily in newspapers, such as creating disturbances, open killings and assassinations, and revenge. Last night, they were fighting each other over jealousy or disagreements, but today, because there are benefits to be gained or power to borrow, they conspire and cooperate as if nothing had happened. On the surface, they are associating with the powerful and participating in good deeds to gain political and social status; secretly, they are engaging in all sorts of illegal and criminal activities.</p>
<p>There are also women who are unscrupulous and only care about profit. Tonight, they are in the arms of their lovers, and tomorrow they will accept expensive ornaments from the hands of the people who killed their lovers. The day after tomorrow, they will repeat this set of tricks as usual. Therefore, some people say that gangsters and prostitutes are the elements and characteristics of capitalist society. If someone were to thoroughly and deeply describe the lives of these gangsters and bullies, they could write a work even greater than Zola's series or Tolstoy's "War and Peace."</p>
<p>This film "The Gay Bride" depicts the lives of gangsters. Of course, it only uses the trivial matters of a few private thugs in a certain region of the Atlantic as its subject matter, and the author cannot fully express himself, so the achievement is limited.</p>
<p>It starts with the entanglement between the gangster Su Shi and the actress Man Lan. From the revenge of the enemy party on the day of their marriage, the coveting of the bride by his trusted followers Ding Gan and Mi Gai, and the bodyguard's (little errand boy) resistance and advice, it introduces five or six character lines. It writes about the mutual deception and mutual killing between men and women, money and flesh, and the decadent lives of money and flesh. Naturally, these realities related to the current social system are not vividly captured by the author through his narrow and shallow understanding. It is only a part of the relationships between them - the gangsters. It neglects their role in helping those above them and their mission of oppressing those below them in the current society. Moreover, it embellishes reality and uses ridiculous moralizing, such as portraying the gangster's loyal bodyguard (little errand boy) as so loyal and chivalrous, making people forget that he is an accomplice who protects whom? And arousing goodwill towards the gangster. As well as using the actress, the female gangster who played with so many gangsters, to realize that she took the tens of thousands of family property that she had repeatedly tricked out with her body and distributed it on the street as a great philanthropist to help the poor. As for the fact that when Su Shi and his wife went on their honeymoon to Europe, many countries refused them entry, this is also a deceiving lie. In fact, gangsters like Su Shi in the play who traffic in alcohol and play with women, as long as they do not have ambitions to rebel, as portrayed in the play, except for some competition among peers for fame, power, and women, they have not committed any heinous crimes, and the authorities would not refuse them entry.</p>
<p>The director Jack Conway has achieved commendable results in "The Gay Bride". He accurately grasps the atmosphere of the gangster's life throughout the play and clearly portrays the five or six character lines. In particular, the personality of the little errand boy, every scene, everyone's coming and going, is given a moving and profound sense of inspiration by this atmosphere and character. In comparison, the results in several large scenes are not as great as many small places with cleverness. Originally, it was a rough, lively, and superficial script, but it achieved delicate and meticulous effects.</p>
<p>Among the actors, Chester Morris, who played the little errand boy, left the deepest impression.</p>
<p>Joan Parker playing the goddess of nature in "She Creature" - Showing in Nanjing</p>
<h3 id="e247">The Earth-Shattering "She Creature" <a href="#e247" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c247" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">247</a></h3>
<p>— Yunshui</p>
<p>Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer spent a year producing this rare and magnificent beast film, hailed as one of the best in twenty years. The great director Van Dyke Ming calls the film this year's most successful and stimulating beast drama, and the famous American novelist Zane Grey also praised it highly, recommending it as a unique work in ten years. (Grey is a master of Western novels, and many of his works have been successfully adapted for the screen, especially Trader Horn). On the star list, the charming and lively seventeen-year-old girl Joan Parker takes the lead, while the backbone of the play is two beast stars, one is a strong deer, who plays Malibu in "She Creature", and the other is a mountain lion Puma (American lion species) whose name is Gando.</p>
<p>Obviously, the law of the jungle in the forest has always been regarded as the iron law of evolution. But after all, all things are endowed with compassion, and all acts of predation and killing ultimately stem from some kind of impulse. Probably, birds flying in the sky, beasts walking on land, scales living in water, and insects hiding in mud can never escape the two major circles of "food" and "sex." What is called love is the root of life, and life depends on desire. Regardless of the type of animal, they are equally endowed with the function of survival, such as claws, fangs, stings, and venom, skin armor, feathers, and hair, which are innate protective tools. Then, a question arises here: do humans' intellect - the tool for protecting the survival of the race - and compassion, also have this special function? Or do they merely kill to survive, and survive to kill? That's right, "She Creature," which will be released in Nanjing soon, can give us a very satisfactory answer.</p>
<h3 id="e248">Jottings "Wife's Lover" <a href="#e248" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c248" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">248</a></h3>
<p>— Guocheng</p>
<p>RKO's new film "Wife's Lover" (Head Coat and Glove) is a story about a mysterious murder that occurs with both romantic and suspicious elements.</p>
<p>The original name of "Wife's Lover" should be translated directly as "Hat, Coat, and Glove." Therefore, we can certainly know how important these three things are in this film. If you want to use the simplest method to explain the relationship between these three things, it is like this: when this mysterious murder happened to a girl, people found her body in her lover's room, and at this time, a woman's hat and a man's coat and a glove were found in the room, and these things were used as clues in the case.</p>
<p>At least, this is a very tragic and moving film. Every scene in the play is filled with a tense atmosphere. The actors Rich do Cordeg and Barbara Robbins are both working hard in this film. The director's technique is also very easy. When the film was released in New York, it received praise from more than a dozen newspapers such as the "New York Daily News" and the "New York Evening Post."</p>
<p>Movie Novel</p>
<h3 id="e249">The Hatred of India's Subjugation (Clive of India) (9) <a href="#e249" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c249" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">249</a></h3>
<p>— Maode</p>
<p>When Clive arrived in India, he observed the overall situation and felt that the only way to rebuild a solid foundation for his country's merchants was to use Mir Jafar. Siraj ud-Daulah was a cruel and despicable person. Mir Jafar was relatively easy to manipulate. He was Siraj ud-Daulah's uncle and now led Siraj ud-Daulah's army. Although he was in opposition to the British, if he could be moved by profit and made to turn against his own side, then the British could win without a fight. Therefore, Clive wanted to collude with Mir Jafar and make a secret agreement with him: if he could turn against his own side, Britain would do everything in its power to guarantee that he would become the King of India, and the reward that Britain sought was merely the ability to continue free trade.</p>
<p>Clive did nothing without consulting Margaret. He told Margaret, and she wondered, "This seems to go beyond your military scope." Clive proudly said, "We must now use political tactics. Our current work is the creation of an empire!" So he went to secretly negotiate with Mir Jafar. Mir Jafar actually expressed acceptance of his idea, but he insisted that the British Admiral Watson, stationed in India, sign the agreement before Mir Jafar would agree. Therefore, Clive had to consult with Watson again.</p>
<p>Admiral Watson was an old, corpulent British naval veteran. At first, when he heard that Mir Jafar had promised that if he signed the secret agreement, he would pay him 40,000 pounds in cash every year, he couldn't help but be moved. He held the pen in his hand and carefully read the clauses of the secret agreement on the table, looking for whether the gift of 40,000 pounds a year was clearly stated. He was about to sign, but suddenly became frightened and withdrew his hand. He thought to himself, what if this matter doesn't succeed... what if they lose the war... the secret agreement falls into the hands of others... with his name on it... what would happen then? He was a prudent person. He couldn't swallow this piece of fat. So he repeatedly shook his head and said, "No, no. My conscience does not allow this thing."</p>
<p>Clive said, "If you don't sign, the whole plan will fail, and the empire will not be established." But once Watson had doubts, no matter how Clive explained, he could no longer move his heart. What he feared was Mir Jafar's reversal, but he kept saying that his conscience did not allow him to do such a thing.</p>
<p>Watson left, and Edmund ran in. He saw the disappointed look on Clive's face and said, "Then everything is over. Mir Jafar will definitely use all his strength against us." Clive frowned, suddenly laughed loudly and said, "This matter must be carried out according to the original plan, it cannot be a failure." Edmund was in shock, Clive had already picked up the pen and signed the name of "Charles Watson" on the secret agreement.</p>
<p>Edmund exclaimed in horror, "He will know." Clive said, "If the war is won, Watson will be the first to rush to recognize this secret agreement. Take this to Mir Jafar!" After he finished speaking, his body collapsed in the chair, and he held his head where the old wound had flared up again. Edmund shouted beside him, "Robert!" Clive also ordered, "Pass the order down. March tomorrow morning!"</p>
<p>By the next morning, Clive was wearing his military uniform, standing by the window, listening to the bugle calls outside, already prepared to depart. Infantry squads marched past one after another. Many elephants and camels carrying military supplies, guns, cannons, and food also set off. This was much more organized than the "madman team" a few years ago, but it was still far inferior to Siraj ud-Daulah's army. (To be continued)</p>
