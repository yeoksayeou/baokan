<h3 id="c11">英國總選舉的展望 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>英國議會已於上月廿五日解散。新議會在本月十四日總選舉後。卽可產生。此事對於英國的內政外交。都有重大的關係。日來各黨宣傳競爭。已人最緊張的階段。我們不妨在總結果揭曉之前。把目前英國各黨競逐的形勢。與這次總選所包含的意義。作一扼要的分析</p>
<p>這次解散了的英國議會是一九三一年秋間舉出的。照例沒有特殊的問題發生。它應該在五年期滿後。無疾而終。到明年秋間纔　行總選。現在的提早解散重選。乃是保守黨的一種策略。原來一九三一年的議會選出後。由於工黨和自由黨一部分領袖的投機。與保守黨共組混合內閣。他們稱之爲國民內閣。實則以保守黨的勢力和政策爲骨幹。到了一九三二年秋。保守黨召開哇太華會議。推進其保護貿易的政策。一部分的工黨和自由黨投機者。如施諾登及薩繆爾。因主張不合。被迫退出內閣。此後保守黨的勢力乘機發展。一部分戀棧的工黨和自由黨領袖。如麥唐納和西門等也更加官僚化。完全成爲保守黨的傀儡。但在最近一二年來。德國軍事勢力的勃興。造成歐陸外交上的嚴重問題。英國內部失業數字的繼長增高。使工黨左翼的勢力深入羣衆。在這緊急的時刻。麥唐納的柔順。與西門的庸懦。旣不能供號召。且引起一部分保守黨的嫌惡。被認爲彼等政策上的障礙物。於是在本年夏初。保守黨領袖鮑爾溫。遂由幕後牽綫的人物。一變而爲親自主演的要角。以沉着老練的霍爾任外相。以少年英俊的艾登。奔走於日內瓦及歐陸各國首都之間。這樣的整飭陣容。目的也就是爲了應付未來的總選舉。等到意阿糾紛突然緊張。英國的海洋交通「生命綫」受到威脅。這個傳統的國防外交問題引起許多國民的注意。保守黨的統治者看準這個機會。便决定提早解散議會。企圖利用一般國民對外不安的心理。達到選舉獲勝的目的。</p>
<p>就大勢推測起來。這次保守黨的策略是可以成功的。目前議會候選人一二九五名。其中政府黨佔五五七名。反對黨佔七。三八名。反對黨中工黨佔五四〇名。自由黨一七五名。獨立工黨二一名。共產黨二名下。院議席爲六百餘位。因工黨與自由黨無聯合的可能。政府黨卽易佔多數。事實上目前能與保守黨匹敵的。祗有工黨。但一九三一年一部工黨領袖的官僚化。給該黨以一個重大的打擊。本年漢特森與龐森貝的逝世。以至最近因對意制裁問題而引起黨魁蘭斯褒及克利浦斯的辭職。又使該黨在總選的近期。不及整飭陣容。以全力對付政敵。保守黨趁這時候發動總選舉。正也是看準了工黨這個弱點的。所以保守黨的獲取勝利。大致可無問題。但工黨在本年幾次市區的選舉中。很有發展。最近在英格蘭與威爾斯的各市區雖然失敗。在蘇格蘭還是佔優勢的。所以保守黨的能否得到壓倒的勝利。還是疑問。而施諾登與勞合喬治及薩繆爾所結成的新陣綫。多少也可以把衰頹了的自由黨勢力維持下來。不致全傾向到保守黨去。</p>
<p>但保守黨卽使能獲得勝利。而在未來要長保優勢。却不容易。英國內政外交上成爲選舉中爭持的問題的。一向有保護及自由貿易的問題。印度自治與直接統治的問題。國防問題及失業問題等等。照最近的趨勢。似乎主要的兩大問題。是對外的能否保持和平。與對內的能否减少失業。英國人民的厭戰心理。從本年春間的試騐投票。可以看出這次保守黨政府的擁護國聯。主張對意制裁。就是用以迎合選民的心理的。但一方面嚷說和平。一方面保守黨政府仍力主擴大海軍。換言之。保守黨統治者乃是以維持和平的幌子。企圖繼續其帝國主義武裝的政策。這烟冪在不久仍會露出破綻的。因爲軍備負担的增加。使國民經濟生活更見痛苦。同時失業人數並不减少。則工黨的對外力求和平。對內消滅失業的政策。便會吸引更多人的注意。只要國際形勢一起變化。這影響也許很快就會給我們看到的。</p>

<h3 id="c21">意阿戰爭緊急中　蘇彞士運河的地位 <a href="#c21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— 仲足</p>
<p>當這東菲戰爭緊張的時候，那條聯接着地中海和紅海的一百哩長的狹仄水道，完全處於白熱化狀態了。講到它原還有一段複雜的歷史。在這條運河未鑿通之前，從歐洲駛往東方的船舶是必須繞道好望角以入印度洋的，因此幾世紀來頗有人夢想着紅海和地中海之間能有一條水道以利通商纔好。一七九九年，拿破崙想在蘇彝士海峽替法軍覓一到印度的捷徑，曾派了工程師去實地測量過；十九世紀，以工業革命勢力的急速擴展，早日完成運河的需要，是更來得迫切了。</p>
<p>當開鑿運河的計畫傳說之初，最表示反對的是英國。因這條運河於她雖然有利，但她在近東和印度有着重要的利益，深恐因交通便利而受別國勢力的滅脅，於是她便百計阻撓一切開鑿運河的計畫，而主張仍維持繞道好望角的通商路綫。</p>
<p>這樣，蘇彝士運河的開繫計劃便擱了起來。一八三四年，土耳其駐埃及總督阿雷（Mohammed　Aly　Pasha）會有意開掘，但一知道這將危及他在埃及的地位，叉復打消。一八四一年，遠東公司（Peuinular　and　Orietal　Company）經理安得生（Arthut　Anderson）向英國外交部提出開鑿運河計畫，使英國到東方的路程縮短數千哩，英政府也不接受。一八四七年，法國的提倡者叉擬定開掘運河的新計畫，而英人仍以爲道只是不能實現的幻想。</p>
<p>可是後來，西歐各國的公意都贊助這個計畫，而同時又得了土耳其駐埃總督塞得（SaidPasha）的同意，於是英國的反對也慢慢緩和下來。一八五四年，塞得授予法工程師雷索恩（Ferdinand　de　Lesseps）初步讓與權，組織蘇彝士運河公司（Compagnie　Univereselle　du　Canal　Maritime　de　Snez），訂約規定將來那運河「應永遠開放，作爲任何商船可自由通過的中立水道。」</p>
<p>運河於一八六九年開放，那不列顛政治家所久引爲恐懼的理想終於變做成功的事實了。運河開放以後，各國對於運河法律地位的規定都表示非常關切，雖然公司章程上說明着各國商船或兵船無論戰時或平時都可駛過運河，然而這種聲明，在國際法上是不生效的，且同時英法兩國都想在埃及方面培植勢力，互相嫉視很烈，因此，那蘇彝士運河公司的宗主國土耳其政府於一八七三年召集歐洲各關係國在　士坦丁會議，結果共同聲明兵艦和運兵船也得於平等原則下駛過運河。這樣運河的地位總算大體决定，蓋以脫離一國的管治而置於歐洲共同保護之下了。後二年，英國政府向埃及伊斯密爾國王（Khedibe）購得蘇彝士運河公司全部股份的百分之四十四，這購置的目標顯然的是在於分佔其管理權。</p>
<p>當時埃及總督阿拉皮（Arahi　Pasha）的叛亂給與了英國佔據埃及的機會。一八八二年，英國不顧運河公司的抗議，假埃及國王之名佔領運河，派兵登陸，並微收運河通行稅，一八八三年英國外交部代表埃及國王遍發通牒，提出關於運河的建議。大意說運河應不能視爲中立，在實際上，無論戰時或平時，各國任何船隻都得通行，但禁止在運河區城內有敵對的行爲，而由埃及政府負資保護。</p>
<p>法國見英國在埃及的勢力日益膨脹，深恐於運河的自由通過有所妨礙，而歐洲各國也以一八七三年的聲明書過於簡單，對於重要事項（如戰事發生，當地政府叉爲交戰國之一時，運河仍否開放問題）並無規定，乃於一八八五年由主要八國在巴黎集會，討論運河自由通過權的保障方式，法國主張由國際共同管理，英國主張必須由當地政府保護，遂無結果。至一八八八年，英法成立諒解，乃成立八國運河公約。公約條文十七欵，規定運河由一國際委員會管理，但委員會雖有觀察諸約施行之權，實際上却無力履行義務，如運河的安全或其自由通行發生阻礙，委員會只能集會交換意見，最後措置仍須由埃及政府（Khedivial　Covernment）决定，這是英國所認爲滿　的。一九〇四年英法相互承認彼此在摩洛哥和埃及的地位，訂立協定，在協定中對於運河委員會的原有効力，更加縮小，甚至每年一次的例行會議，也於無形中消滅了。</p>
<p>當美西戰爭時，西班牙戰艦經蘇彝士運河開往斐律賓，引起美國國務卿向英政府詢問非蘇彝士運河公約簽字國的美國是否也可遣軍艦駛過運河，英政府當答說並無簽約國與非簽約國之分，可絕無問題。日俄戰爭時俄軍艦自由在運河進出。意土戰爭爆發後，埃及政府會引用一八八八年運河公約規定的權力，不許土耳其五艘戰船在賽得港停泊，而將它繳了械。在大戰以前，交戰國的船隻經過運河者大致沒有甚麼　變發生。</p>
<p>一到大戰爆發，因其範圍的廣大，蘇彝士運河的地位就起了劇烈的變動。土耳其加入同盟集團，而埃及則宣布爲不列顛的保護國。不列顛旣跟土耳其成了敵對的交戰國，便以履行運河公約爲名，派集大軍於運河沿岸及埃及。埃及所有的港口都成爲交戰口岸，而蘇彝士運河則成爲協約國的交通綫了。</p>
<p>自一九一四年後，蘇彝士運河實際已成爲不列顛的水道。不但敵國形跡可疑的船隻統加扣押，就是早日援引一八八八年運河公約駛入運河區域的德國商船，也遭埃及政府勒令離開。例如德商船（Gntenfels　Prize）號等被迫開出運河區域後，還遭英國軍艦捕獲，由埃及海上捕獲法庭判决充公，判决理由以爲這種船隻雖得自由通過運河，但不得在運河；逗留不去，借此以爲避難口岸（Court　User　of　the　partas　a　part　of　refuge）因爲這種行爲將危及運河的地位。</p>
<p>自意阿戰爭爆發，英意對立日益尖銳以來，上述複雜的關係楚已冉燃起來了。使意國一舉而滅阿比西尼亞，埃及和不列顛都將陷於無比的危險中。因爲假如意國控制了藍尼羅河源的塔納湖，埃及便要餓死。至於不列顛所受的威脅更是雙重的，他在蘇丹和埃及的特殊利益固然動搖，就是蘇彝士運河本身也將處於極端危險中，因爲運河在地理上原也賴着開羅的尼羅河灌漑的。而且，意大利的東征也許還要引起蘇丹埃及以及英國在非洲各處屬地土人的騷動，而危及英國的統治。</p>
<p>根據一九零六年英法意協調的和平談判既已失敗，英國一面已促使國聯對意實施經濟制裁，一面叉把艦隊調集地中海各部，準備必要時，作武力對付了。如果英意戰爭爆發，則意國艦隊必無通過運河的機會，雖然有一八八八年運河公約和一九零四年英法共同聲明書的保障，意國方面儘有法律的根據，然而我們如果一審察，英國對於運河開鑿以來的態度，則可知，當英帝國利益受了嚴重威脅時，他是不惜出於截斷蘇彝士脈管的一途的，大戰時對於德國商船的措置，不是一個顯著的先例嗎？</p>

<p>— 唐慶增主編　W．Belden-M．Salter原著子明節譯</p>
<p>中國的煤藏，分佈全國，山西陝西兩多，其他各省的藏量，大都均可供給當地要，新疆靑海甘肅的產量還沒有詳細的統中國本部南方數省的煤礦露出層，大抵都在山側，局部的開採，都很容易，中國地質學家翁文戾氏說過，「在雲南境內，行五十英里而未見露出之煤層者，未之有也，福建煤之出產頗富。縱最貧之家，亦日夜用煤，因較諸熄滅重起爐火較省也」，山西陝西的煤藏極畜，而產量極微，開灤煤礦藏量雖不多，而因爲開採，運輸的便利，很是重要，</p>
<p>東三省的煤藏多半在長白山系山腹中，開採很不便利，最重要的爲日人開採的撫順，本溪湖，烟台煤區，產量佔東北四省總產量的百分之八十，東北一九三一年總產量是〇〇〇〇九〇〇噸，此地佔了七二〇〇〇〇〇噸，此外尙未完全開採的是吉林的穆稜，密山，黑龍江的河干，和熱河的北蔡，這些地方的煤資極劣，不能煉炭，實業上的用途較少，開灤和本溪湖的煤，可煉成炭，實業上海軍上用途極廣，</p>
<p>山西陝西的無烟煤和烟煤，儲量極多，但是因爲交通不便，運輸困難，開採事業不發達，所以產量極少，貨棄於地，很是可惜，現在該處交通的主要綫，不過地平到太原一條，運費昂貴，自然不能做運煤的用，目前開採的煤礦，大都在汾河河谷，和接連華北平原的東南界，該處居民，亦較稠密，</p>
<p>撫順開澳地位好，交通便，南滿路更有支綫通撫順，開澳在海濱，同天津的交通最便利，現在開澳煤更可經秦皇島不凍港出口，自然更爲方便，</p>
<p>現在全國新式煤礦有四十八所，其中用中國質本開採的不過百分之三十三，用日本資本開採的占百分之一三十，用英國資本開採的占百分之十，開澳撫順都用新法開採，撫順的煤礦坑更是出色，最大的礦坑已開採了七十年，現在深二百英尺，</p>
<p>山東的煤，品質極好，運輸亦便，用新法開採的亦多，　莊中興煤礦，可說是煤礦的模範，服務該礦的工人，每月的收入從七元五角到五十八元不等，因爲生活程度極低，都可以維持全家的生活</p>
<p>中國全國的礦工，薪舊礦都計算在內，約有二十萬人，每人每天可採煤〇·三五噸，全年不過一百二十六噸，比利時每人每年可採二百噸，英國每人每年可採二百二十五噸，美國每人每年可採六百八十八噸，比較起來，中國煤礦的效率相差很遠，</p>
<p>三國的煤礦，儲煤的量，全世界獨一，我們以爲要設法開採，必須要有四個先决條件，（一）發展交通事業，（二）穩定政治金融，（三）發展其他實業，（四）聚集資本和技術人才，附表一</p>

<p>— 中央研究院天文　期究所硏究員　陳遵嬀</p>
<p>九個大行星裏頭，除了地球以外還有八個，這八個裏頭水星和金星是比地球更近於太陽，就是他們的軌道是在我們地球軌道的裏面，目火星以至冥王星是比地球更遠於太陽，就是他們的軌道，是在我們地球軌道的外側。天文家把軌道在地球軌道內側的行星呌做內行星，外側的行星，呌做外行星。我們從地球上看內行星和外行星的視運動，是不一樣的。</p>
<p>內行星和太陽和地球在一個直綫的時候，呌做合。合叉有上合和下合的區別。內行星見於太陽後方的時候，就是太陽在地球和內行星的中間時候，呌做上合，當內行星見於太陽前方的時候，就是內行星在太陽和地球的中間時候，呌做下合。現在請各位預備一張紙，一支鉛筆。在紙上書兩個同心圓，就是以一點爲中心，畫內外大小兩個圓，中心只有一點的。假設中心是太陽，內圓是內行星的軌道，外圓是地球的軌道，在外圓上任意拿一點，譬如是甲點，把甲點和太陽相連絡起來必交內圓於一點，譬如是乙點，設地球在甲點，內行星在乙點，則呌做下台。把甲乙兩點的直綫再延上過去一定交內圓於他一點，譬如是丙點，設地球在甲站，內行星在丙點，這呌上合·上合時候，我們看他是中西向東運行，就是順行；下合時候，我們看他是由東向西運行，就是逆行。叉內行星的軌道比地球軌道小，所以我們從地球上看他們和太陽的距離，是有一定的限度。就是金星不能超過四十六度，水星不能超過二十八度。因爲這個原因，所以我們只能够在早晨或旦夕刻，才可以看見金星和水星·水星體積甚小，並且和太陽最大距離不能過二十八度，所以常常在太陽前後而出沒，我們觀測非常的困難。金星就是我們中國古代所呌做太白星，他和太陽的距離可以達到四十六度，所以往往當太陽快出來的時候，別的星都不能够看見，惟有這金星還可以認知他在東方的位置，我們中國古代呌他做啟明星，就是這時候的金星。又當太陽剛下去，別的星都看不見的時候，惟有這金星，輝明於西方的天空，中國古代呌他做長庚星。所以所謂「東有啟明，西有長庚」者實在就是一個金星的別名。金星和太陽的距離三十九度半的時候，若在下合，則其光度最大，就是當金星下合前後三十六日左右，雖然白天也可以看見他。一星下合一周，大概要五百多天，所以他的最明有時全年一次都不見，亦有一年能够看見兩次的。譬如今年九月八日金星和太陽下合，所以在三十六日左右以前就是八月三日左右，他是最明。那時候京滬各地報紙，都登有白畫看見星體的新聞，這就是金星畫見的時期。叉在九月八日的三十六日之後，即本月十五日，他叉是最亮的。所以今年金星有兩次最亮的時候。</p>
<p>上面所說的就是內行星的情形，現在再就外行星來說就是當外行星，太陽，地球在一個直綫的時候，當太陽在外行星和地球的中間，呌做合，地球在太陽和行星的中間，叫做衝。就上面所畫的圖來說，假設內圓是地球的軌道，外圓是外行星的軌道。這說地球在乙點，外行星在甲點，這時候叫做衝。把乙丙再延長過去交外圓於丁點，當地球在乙點，外行星在丁點時候叫做合。外行星多自西向東而運行，僅於衝的前後稍爲逆行。火星的衝在天文學上最爲有名。</p>
<p>上面所說的是從我們地球上所看見行星和衛星運行的情形，現在第四我們要說彗星的運行。慧星籌是普通呌做掃帚星。我們通常所看見的是帶有長尾巴的星，他也是繞着太陽而運行的，不過他的軌道形狀，不像行星是圓形相近的橢圓形，他是一個長橢圓形，或且是一個拋物綫的形狀，也有是雙曲綫的形狀，橢圓形軏道的彗星，按一定的時期，回來一次，這呌做周期彗星。譬如宣統二年（公元一千九百十年）時候，我們曾經看見一個非常的大，幷且拖有長尾巴的星，這呌做哈雷彗星。他的軌道就是橢圓形，他約以七十六年的時間環繞太陽一周，所以我們可以預先知道民國七十五年的時候，這個彗星一定又要出現。他如道光十五年（公元一千八百三十五年）乾隆二十四年（公元一千九百五十九年）康熙二十五年（公元一千六百八十二年）都有彗星出現的紀錄，這些彗星，也都是哈雷彗星的回來。我們再往前推，可以知道歷史上最初記載這個彗星的出現，是在秦始皇七年（公元前二百四十年）的時候·一起到現在已經回來過二十九次·從前人類科學沒有發達以前，以爲彗星的發現，一定有什麽災難要發生的，最可怪的，宣統二年哈雷彗星出現以後，淸朝就完了，那時的人民仍是迷信的，現在我們按歷史上的紀載，和天文學家的觀測推算，確然證明了這僩彗星運行的情形，我們不獨可以知道彗星過去的出現情形，更可以預報將來的出現，所以迷信的觀念，自然也打破了。</p>
<p>第五，就是流星。我們每於夜晚常常看見有光點由空中某點飛躍而過者，就是流星。這流星雖然是字宙裏頭的微塵。但是他的運行亦不是散亂無章，他們常常各自成羣，多遵循彗星的軌道繞太陽而運行。有時候彗星來回幾次以後就消滅不見，但是依附他的軌道而運行的流星，仍然繼續發見，所以我們也可以說流星就是彗星的遺體。流星碎質距離太陽的遠近不一樣，所以繞行的速度亦不同，於是漸漸分佈於軌道的上面，時間愈久，則軌道愈長，結果將成爲長橢形的微塵環。因爲這些橢圓軌道和地球軌道位置的關係，所以於每年某一定的日期，就有某羣的流星出現。</p>
<p>要之，太陽系裏頭的天體，除衛星是環繞行星，而運行以外，都是以太陽爲中心，而迴轉運行的。所以太陽是太陽系的主人翁，至於各星何以要環繞太陽運行，和他們的軌道何以是橢圓形，這是關於萬有引力的作用，比較專門一點我們暫且不講，現在要講恒星界的運行了。</p>
<p>我們上面已經說過，恒星的位置是永久不動的，但是詳細的研究起來，絕對不是不動的·他也有變動，不過他們詎離我們非常的遠，在我們的眼中是不容易覺察的·天空各恒星的排列，經過若干年代以後，他的姿勢自然也發生了變化，不過他的改變，非常的小，譬如就北斗七星來講，什麼是北斗七星？各位大家都知道的，我們到了晚上向北面看天空上有七個亮的星，排成熨斗形狀，那就是北斗七星。我們現在所看見的位置，是柄上三個星，斗是四個星。現在請各位再預備一張紙一支鉛筆，把北斗的形狀，畫在紙的上面，要把斗口向上，斗底放成水平綫的樣式。各星是都有名字的，就是從柄端第一星說起呌做搖光，開陽，玉衡，天權，天璣，天璇，天樞。這是天文學上的名稱，現在我們爲便利起見，暫以一二三四五六七做他們的名稱。把他們用綫按次序連結起來，他們現在的位置是一二和斗底平行，成水平方向二三四差不多是一個直綫，稍向右下方。並且，一二，二三，三四的長短差不多是一樣的。四五更向右下折轉，五六是底，六七叉向右上折，他的長短差不多和四五一樣，這個形狀，各位一看天空就可以知道的。</p>
<p>但是二十萬年前和二十萬年後，他們的位置，就完全不同了。現在我們先說二十萬年前，他們的形狀，那時候柄上一二三四四個星，差不多是成一個直綫，並且一二的長比二三和三四合起來的長，還要長一點·四五對於五六說，不是像現在的向左上折·是稍向右上折的。六七是向左上斜折，就是現在的斗口是口大底小，那時候的斗口是口小底大，口的直徑差不多只有底長的一半；並且六七的長也比四五要長出一半，現在再講二十萬年以後的形狀，那時候一二不成水平形狀就是不和斗底平行，是在和斗底相垂直的方向。六七則向右斜，不過在底邊的略略上面上點，就是斗的一邊向外移，斗口的長徑比底邊二倍長還要大。這樣看起來，在二十萬年前或二十萬年後的時候，我們絕對不能呌這個七星做爲北斗七星了，因爲他們的形狀完全不是斗形了。</p>

<p>— Louisa　M．Alcott原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>「你怎樣維持生活呢」？這是很長很長的路程你究不是個已經長大的小伙子。」</p>
<p>「呵！我的脚沒有受傷以前，起初倒還能過去。人家給我東西吃，我睡在農家的倉庫裏，日間總在路上走。我因爲要抄近路，迷了路，要不然我到這裏還要早些。」</p>
<p>「但假如你不想進來再住在這裏，那末你要去做什麼呢？」</p>
<p>「我本來計畫要來再看看坦第和你：然後再回到城裏去做我的老工作，只不過我是太疲倦了，因此就在草堆上陲着了。假如你不找到我，我明天早晨以前必已離開這裏了。」</p>
<p>「你不高興我找到了你嗎？」蜀夫人說時向他看着，有一半笑樂一半責備的神氣，同時她是跪在他面前，去騐看他受傷的一足。顏色漸漸上了唐恩的臉，他的眼睛却總是在碗碟之上，同時很輕地說道：「不，師母，我是高興的，我想留着，不過我怕你…」</p>
<p>他沒有說完這一句話，因爲裴媽媽剛在道時，看見他的脚傷得很利害，不禁喊了起來。</p>
<p>「你什麼時候受傷的？」</p>
<p>「三天以前。」</p>
<p>「你一直在這般狀態之下走着嗎？」</p>
<p>「我有一根杖，我每到一個溪邊，將它一洗，一個女人給我一塊布頭，暫時把它裏了起來。」</p>
<p>「裴先生得立時來一看，好好拿來包紮，」蜀夫人說着即趕到隔壁房間去，故意將門半開，使得唐恩可以聽見一切的經過。</p>
<p>「茀力子，那個童子已經歸來了。」</p>
<p>「誰？唐恩？」</p>
<p>「正是，坦　先看見他在窗外，我們呌他，他偏走開了，藏在草坪上的乾草堆後面。我剛才在那兒找到了他，睡的熟，因爲疲乏和痛苦，已經不像個人的樣子。他一月以前從貝先生方面逃子出去，從此以　一直　我們這裏走來。他裝作不要我們見他，只來瞧我們一下即往城裏去從事他舊工作。然而分明他希望回到這裏來的，因此他不一切患難，直向這裏來，他　在正在那裏等着，不知你肯饒恕放他回來嗎？」</p>

<p>王文正對卡遜必有一番劇戰　混合雙打决賽亦於今日解决</p>
<p>硬地網球各賽全在决賽期中、除女子單打錦標業已解决外、女子雙打與男子雙打亦於昨日完結、昨賽以邱黎對卡德最爲精彩、掌聲時起、觀衆僅百餘人、惟局勢甚爲緊張、今日有王文正對卡遜之單打及混合雙打决賽、王卡二人必有一番劇戰、</p>
<p>邱黎兩將卒為所敗</p>
<p>二時正邱飛海與黎廣駿對卡遜德孚之雙打開始、邱黎因勁敵來臨、無不小心翼翼、謹愼從事、老邱十分賣力、戰來甚爲緊張、惟德孚之壓殺每使邱黎無以應對、致第二兩局均爲卡德所獲、第三局輪及廣駿開球、阿黎之發球確然有力、扳回一局、老邱竭其全力、用其佳妙之抽擊、又下一局、至第五局中、雙方各不相讓、德孚之欄網每見奇功、老邱之長抽亦多佳作、比數之接近無以復加、精彩百出、兩旁觀衆掌聲不絕、戰至六七後、廣駿一紀高球、德孚以爲出綫、因此失敗、第六局卡遜努力奔跑、歸其所有、自此老邱亦用其平生之力、妙球時見、佐以廣駿之攔網、竟連下兩局、卡德　之只得頻頻搖首、而好景不常、在此五對三之絕對優勢下、老邱體力不支、出球亦不能得心應手、連失四局、卡德反敗爲勝、可惜之至、第二第三兩盤全在卡德控制之、雖獲得一二局、又何濟於事、且打來亦極鬆弛、結果三對〇、男子雙打錦標才爲卡遜德孚所得、成績如下、</p>
<p>卡遜　德孚　七—五　六—一　六—二　邱飛海　黎廣駿</p>
<p>馬爾蘭姆榮膺冠軍</p>
<p>女雙打馬賽小姐與海利斯夫人於十二時半以二對戰勝奧伐達與推勒後、始獲得决賽權、待雙打完畢、又與馬爾蘭姆决賽、故體力方面、未免受到影響、而馬蘭兩人實力甚佳、蘭姆夫人頭髮雖白、却能奔跑、且長抽攔網俱能、馬爾之短截亦佳、故錦標之得並非偶然、海利斯之底綫抽擊、常使對方束手、惟馬賽小姐太弱、以致失敗、結果如下、</p>
<p>馬賽　海利斯　六—一　六—四　奧伐達　推勒　（複賽）</p>
<p>馬爾　蘭姆　六—三　六—二　海利斯夫人　馬賽小姐　（决賽）</p>
<p>今日節目全部精彩</p>
<p>今日節目、尙有三組、德孚與馬爾夫人如能擊敗柯爾邱推勒、則將與邱飛海好威爾决賽、爭奪錦標、不識老印能否一失之東隅收之桑楡也、男單打王文正野心勃勃、滿擬奪得錦標、　對手却非弱將、且為雄視滬之卡遜、而卡遜則以為錦標在握、故戰爭定必劇一烈、表演亦必佳妙、茲將今日秩序錄之於下、</p>

<p>——二比零——</p>
<p>對於本屆錦標希望確甚濃厚復旦敗於動作遲慢士無鬥志</p>
<p>中華足球會之中字組、昨日光華與復旦之戰、不啻爲錦標賽、觀衆除兩校學生外、外賓亦多、戰來甚爲緊張、下午三時開始起賽、復旦即取攻勢、惟前鋒缺乏聯絡、射門亦欠準確、以致頻失良機、而左翼程式昌動作之遲慢、亦爲致敗之因、而光華則勢熖極盛、後衛鞏固、前鋒活躍、左翼陳世耕邊陲起義、傳於斗文、斗文乘勢一脚、球乃應聲入網、復旦自失此球、一蹶不振、士無鬥志、待易地再戰後、復旦陣綫仍屬散漫、許竟成單槍匹馬、盤球而進、至十碼處、猛蹴一脚、得功而歸、復旦雖擬反攻、但時不及矣、結果二對〇、光華獲勝、對本屆錦標希望殊爲濃厚也、茲錄變力陳綫如下、</p>

<p>— 劍芬</p>
<p>「不論任何事：假使不動手去做，就是一件很容易的事，也不會成功的；反過來，一件很難的事，只要我們不斷的做下去，終會得到最後勝利的。」小朋友：這個理論是發現新大陸的哥侖布所發表的：他為甚麼綠故要發表這個理論呢？因為：哥倫布發現了新大陸之後，回到故鄉的時候，有許多朋友為他設了一個宴會，一來是慶賀他成功，地來是替他洗塵。當這個宴會快耍完畢的當見，忽有一個朋友站起來說：「發現新大陸，那個不會呢？據我看來，是一件很容易的事。」哥侖布聽了，就呌僕役拿一個雞蛋來，對那朋友道：「朋友：現在請你把這個雞蛋直豎起來！」那朋友毫不思索的答道：「蛋圓是要滾的。怎麼可以豎起來呢？」哥倫布等他說完，就不慌不忙地把蛋的一頭鑿穿一洞，很平穩的豎直在桌子上面。那朋友見了哥倫布這一潘手續，又很高傲的說：「這更容易極了，沒有甚麼希奇；小孩子也會做！」這樣，哥倫布就發表了上面一段的理論。</p>
<p>因此：小朋友：我們要成功一件事，靠嘴說是沒有用的，只有「做」　能得到勝利啊！</p>
<h3 id="c141">盧梭的幼年 <a href="#c141" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e141" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">141</a></h3>
<p>— 閻重樓</p>
<p>盧梭是十八世紀的一個大思想家，也是研究兒童問題的鼻祖，他首倡人類自由平等的學說，對於社會有很大的貢獻：尤共是關放兒童教育，他更闡發了不少的精彩的論著。他說：「吾人應該從見童幼時開拓兒童的大權，與能力的使用。」又說：「吾人應該以模範的力量，使見童的記憶堅固，心情穩健。又說：「對待兒童唯一的手段，為自然的責罰。譬如兒童破壞窗戶的坡璃，那末冷風吹入，自足引起兒童的苦痛，果使這樣，則兒童此可知道惡行發生惡果，必定能夠力求改善」。對於兒童，盧梭以為教育的力量能夠擴張生存，並可使兒童的活動不息。</p>
<p>盧梭是法國人，卻生長在瑞土的日內瓦。他的父親是做鏡錶的生意，他的母親是個牧師的女見。盧梭生下以後，他的母親就死了！所以全靠著他的父親撫養，習讀在他父親的身側。他七歲的時候，就喜歡閱覽小說，後來漸漸學習歷史和傳記，他最喜歡讀希臘羅馬四十六名人傳。九歲那年，他的父親又不幸因為敗訟潛逃。於是盧梭寄居在親戚的家中。十六歲學習雕刻，他不感到興趣，而業師卻非常虐待，盧梭不堪共苦！乃私行脫逃，流浪在法國各地，弄到囊金　罄，百計俱窮！總算遇人接濟，助他上進。一方面也靠他努力不懈，結果名聞全世。歷史上那些偉大的人物，在幼年時大都是經過艱雖和困苦的。</p>
<h3 id="c142">方的蛋 <a href="#c142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— 陳世聰</p>
<p>我想小朋友們一定都很奇怪：世界上那裹會有方的蛋呢？是的，蛋總是橢圓形的，決沒有方的。但是，小朋友你能照了下面的方　做去，卻可以把一個橢圓形的蛋變成方形的。今天是星期日，小朋友們何不大家來製造這個罕有的東西呢！</p>
<p>要把蛋的形狀改變，是很簡單的。祇要拿一個蛋，放在陳醋裏，浸了一二天，蛋殼便會軟而縮小。再拿一隻和蛋大小相合的木匣，把蛋放在匣裏，一局浸在水中，不消一二小時，蛋殼便變硬。從匣裏拿出，便變成了一個方形的蛋了。假使要把它變成三角形或六角形，也可以用同樣的方法。不過祇要預光製好各種形狀的模型便了。</p>
<p>小朋友，這本沒有什麼奇怪的，這不過是利用了化學罷了。因為酷台有酸質，這酸質是具有收斂和侵蝕二種作用，所以使蛋殼軟而縮小，改變狀形了。</p>

<p>— 子明</p>
<p>十一月五日，是期二，天晴。</p>
<p>學校又變個樣兒。各位級任老師，都將課室裏佈置得很精緻。各有各的異趣。有的屬放偉大的，有的表示幽靜的，有的是很美觀的；我們小朋友的心靈，都被這樣的環境吸往著。</p>
<p>我們課室中的坐位，有一定的法則，那就是保甲編組；一個座位是一戶，一徘算一甲，由各戶推遠甲長一人。一教室裏各甲長再推選保長一人，（甲長不可兼任保長）由全校各保長公推鄉長一人。他是我們小朋友最高的領袖。</p>
<p>一教室內小友應遵守谷項規則，都載入保甲規約中，保甲規約由各甲長署名蓋章（或用指印），戶長也要加人的。還有一種是連保切結，擔保本保內不發生事故，違背校規等，如發生，有一戶長違犯校規，其餘各戶長隨時報告鄉長轉呈校方，假如蒙蔽不報，同甲的戶長，也要受同樣處分。所以，保甲制度賞行以後，同學都在正軌上活動。而且對於社會上行的保甲，也很明白其中的意羲；於是我時常向鄰居勸解這種道理。</p>
<p>我們自從校裏辦了保甲以來，小友再沒有制度，專門嬉戲的人。因為我們要辦戶口異動的原故。所以，保甲在社會上是好人組織，在校中是好學生組織。小朋友將來都要做社會人，這是值得我們深深地注意的！</p>
<h3 id="c145">秋葉 <a href="#c145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— 達齋</p>
<p>綠油油的樹葉，是多蠻可愛！一到秋深，都漸漸的快要落盡了，就茫松柏冬　何等常綠樹，也含著幾分秋意，帶看一些蒼老色彩，不像在春夏時那樣的翠碧青葱。</p>
<p>許多詩人做著秋集的詩寫景寫情，各有各的好處，可是樹葉為何交秋就要紛紛落下，卻並沒有誰把這理由在詩裏寫出來，這不能不算是特別；我們現在讀書，不僅是斯斯文文的做文學家，卻要實實在在的做科學家；凡事不僅僅在表面知道所常然，必定要由研究知道所以然；事事如北，將來或許也就有什麼新的發現，所說的秋葉，不過是舉其一端，做個比例罷了。</p>
<p>話得說回來，秋葉為何要落呢？因為秋天的樹葉，在和枝相接連處起一輸綫，這輪綫有離層組織，是幾層柔較細胞所構成，到細胞枯死以後，細胞膜因此破壞，葉裏的織維管束，便會被它截斷，所以全樹的葉子，就這樣漸漸地落盡。</p>
<p>還有秋天太陽光的力量溥弱，樹受太陽光的熱不能夠使它充量吸收養分，要加秋天的天氣此較乾燥，使它要多蒸發出水分，樹因收入養分，既是困難，不得不節省消耗，所以自廳把葉子——消耗養分機關，棄去一部分，使養分節省下來，留著冬天受用，等到來春，再慢慢地恢復原狀，又是青枝條　了。</p>
<h3 id="c146">兒童科學講座一本書——（二）印和訂 <a href="#c146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— 林蔭</p>
<p>上次講過一本書的徘印，是文化史上發明重要的記載。可是像那樣印刷，覺得還有一種弊病。就是一本書印成以後，排字工人重新須把　字還返到原來擺鉛字的架子上（圖一）下次重印的時候，再必須照樣排過，而且一面排，一面印，費時也久，又加鉛字經過印刷機重壓以後，漸漸的磨易，下次應用的時侯，筆畫不清楚。所以有一位英人士坦荷，在一八零四年發明泥版。他把泥覆在鉛字的印床上，壓成陰文，再拿鉛溶澆成陽文的鉛版，（圖二）傘來印刷，就比較便利得多。不過要保有鉛版，成本極犬，而泥版經溶澆以後，又即散碎，也覺年的時候，法人謝羅，更發明了紙版，這樣祇要保存紙型，可以不必留鉛版了，印刷界便更走到進步的途上。</p>
<p>那　排字印刷的方法，稱　　版印刷　。初還是中國發明的。可是，中國人自己不曉得改良，等到傳到歐洲，經外國人的研究以後，父傳到中國來，我們反而要學他們的方法了。</p>
<p>把鉛版放在印架上，刷一次油　，蓋上白紙，就能一張一張的印刷出來。印好以後，那就要拿去裝訂了。裝　的手續，第一先要排好的頁碼。把印好的紙張，依照頁碼挨次排齊，在裝訂的名稱叫排書。（圖三）排好以後再用綫訂起來或用機器軾成鉛絲來訂。（圖四）再裝上封面，那就成了一本書。可是還須經過一次切的手續，使書的四邊整齊，（圖五）這樣，一本書便算完成了。</p>
<h3 id="c147">石臼大仙 <a href="#c147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— 教師匠</p>
<p>在一個鄉僻的村野，住著十來戶種田人家。當夏天農忙的時候，農人都到田裏工作去了。其中有一家田場上放著一隻古舊的石臼。近午時分，天空裏忽起一朵烏雲，不一會，電閃霹靂，雷雨大作。恰巧有個過路的人，經過那裏，便張起紙傘，暫且坐在石臼裏，等雨過而後行。一刻兒雨下得更大，積了一塲大水。待雨過天晴，過路客人去了，田家主人回到家來，突然發現那石臼裏是乾乾的一滴雨水都沒有。這麼大的雷雨掉下來，那石臼裏何以不著一點兒水呢？這覺不是有仙人下凡庇護著這石臼嗎？全村的人都來觀看，大家都說這石臼年代久遠，定已成了仙啦</p>
<p>附近有個窮道士便把這事故意裝玄搆虛，把它張揚起來，一面立著旗杆，懸起　號，稱為『石臼大仙』。不久四方的人都來敬香禮拜。道士收取香錢，不到兩年，居然建起廟宇，供著石臼。風聞遐邇，靈驗一方。</p>
<p>那個過路客第二次重經舊地，忽然看到新造的石臼大仙廟宇，裏頭有不少善男信女，拈香膜拜。探問原由，不覺啞然失笑。便把兩年前坐在石臼中避雨的故事對眾陳說一遍。犬家也就恍然大悟。從此那石臼大仙也不再靈驗了</p>

<p>— 文譽揚</p>
<p>幻籠，是一稱活動的玩具。它能夠變化起來，也可算做一套簡單的魔術。小朋友，你做來玩的時候，把報紙的圖照樣剪下來，貼在原紙皮上面，把顏色依著號碼填上，或者你把它畫在紙皮上，可以照樣做法，就成為一種很有趣的玩具了。</p>
<p>先要準備好各種的材料，剪刀，鏨刀，厚紙皮，顏色膠水。你們預備材料以後，把報紙的圖（一）和圖（二）剪下來，貼在原紙皮上。仍然要把紙皮附照樣剪好，等膠水稍為乾了一些，然後把圖（一），用鏨方照著　綫挖成空白，依若號碼的次序。（紅色二黃色三藍色四綠色）填眼色上去，再把圖（二），左右兩端插入圖（一）左右狹孔，如圖（三）用手左右拉動起來，就覺得非常好玩了！</p>

<p>我正想飛開去時，那斑鳩忽又張開伊的眼睛來。伊對我說道：「再會吧！你是唱得乏了。我的名兒喚做古羅麗，願你時時記掛著我！」</p>

<p>（四）</p>
<p>我懷著一肚子的疑問，飛回巴黎去，一面飛，一面想，我的頭忽然撞在另一雙鳥的頭上，原來地是從面飛過來的，這一撞，出於意外，非常的猛烈，使我們倆都撞倒在一株樹頂上，幸而沒有跌到地下去。我定一定神，向那　手方瞧去，以為他一定要和我鬧起來的。我一見之下，卻見他是一頭全折色的烏，他的頸似乎比我更大一些，額上有一個高冠，顯出一種英雄氣概來。他的　兒，高高的　起在空中，很有　種傲然自大的模樣，然而他動並沒有和我吵鬧的意思。我們很客氣的打了個照呼，彼此道著歉，就開始講起話來。我先問了他的名字，又間他他從那一國飛來的。</p>
<p>對我說：「我相詫異，你意不認譏我，你和我們也許不是同類吧？」</p>
<p>我答道：「先生，委實和你說，我也不知道是屬於那一類的。大家見了我，總是這樣的問著，他們一定是在那裏借著我賭　道呢。」</p>
<p>「你是在說著玩，」他說：「我瞧了你　毛羽，早就知道你是我的弟兄輩了。你的的確確是屬於那很著名和很尊敬的白鸚鵡族。」（未完）</p>

<p>此次兒童年實施委員會主辦兒童演講會，講題的主旨是：「關於兒童年和救濟災區的兒窒。」我對於演講，感覺到有相當的興趣，因此，很有興的懇求老師，替我報名，預備講題目經過兩足星期的練習，並請老師指導，同學批評，於是，很興奮的在上月二十八日，和同學沈雅琴，出席在民教館舉行的演講會。那天出席演講的，據主席報告：「共八十人以上。」我想：人才　磨的多，我一定沒有得標希望。可是，回想一下，我的講詞並不錯；師友們又批評我口齒姿熊也並不壞，我想也許有一綫希望呢！等到各位小朋友都講完了，不一會，主席報告名次，一個個喊下去，喊到來了，沒有我的號數，心裏突的一跳，我竟落選了。那時我很慚愧，怨恨，幾至下淚了，師友們竭力安慰我，這有什麼慚愧，失敗為成功之母，只要以後努力，遇有機會，一定有很好的收　。我想：對的，何必垂頭喪氣呢？所以我如今對於演講仍感到很濃厚的興趣並不灰心。</p>

<p>于委員右任在六中全會閉會辭中說：「…水旱天災相接而至，國際環境的緊張和世界經濟變遷的影響，使我們處在這個國難嚴重中的國家一天天的增加艱難的程度。我們不能否認在此十個月間全國上下掙扎奮鬥的苦辛，但我們必須指出，要度過這個艱危萬狀的時期，實在還需要更進一步的赤誠和團結，還需要十倍百倍的努力，救亡圖存，必須要集中國力與充實民力，以自身奮鬥的力量，來挽救環境的艱難。……」這幾句話眞是我們人人所要說的話，也是我們人人朝夕不忘的希望。所謂「赤誠」，所謂「團結」，所謂「自身奮鬥的力量」，無疑的是今日國難嚴重中的中國唯一更生的動力。</p>
<p>「但到底怎樣才算眞正的團結？這雖然已成老生常談的話，但在團結聲浪高漲的今日，確有重新估定其價値之必要。以往，團結的招牌也曾爲有權者懸掛過，團結的法螺也曾爲有勢者吹號過，然而終究法螺敲破了，照牌打碎了，分崩離柝的局面重又顯現了。所以一時以利害的關係而結合，到底仍脫不了苟合，决不是團結。今日爲了共赴國難的大目標而促成舉國團結的風氣，當然是可欣幸的，然而我人猶不能不希望，每一個分子之間都應發生一種眞正的『親愛精誠」，如天然的黏液似的生一種黏着固合作用，要這樣才能永遠團結，永遠不分離。</p>
<p>欲實行眞正的團結，我人認爲至少應具下列三點：</p>
<p>一，團體觀念我人生存於人羣集合的社會組織之下，個人决不能超出社會的影響之外，所以個人主義，自由行動，往往會妨碍羣衆的共同秩序，個人慾望的勃發就是戕賊團體的罪魁禍首。所以要實現團結的大前提，須絕對拋棄自我主義，培養成始終爲團體的觀念。</p>
<p>二，犧牲精神所謂犧牲，包含有二大意義二從消極方而講，爲了完成團體的意志或福利，必先犧牲個人的主見或屬利；從積極方面講，爲了大衆的幸福和利益，我居團體一份子的資格，决不可袖手旁觀，坐視成敗，而應赴湯蹈火，决不旋踵，這才是積極的犧牲精神之表現。</p>
<p>三，紀律生活浪漫的生活表現於精神者勢必渙散而無秩序，無秩序，無紀律，均爲團結的致命傷。只有養成嚴肅的紀律生活，纔能激發渙散的人心，團結分離的意志。</p>
<p>人類之需要團結固不自今日始，從洪荒以迄於今，團結者存，個別者亡，</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>差不多已成爲歷史的鐵的原則。上古草昧時代，禽獸遍野，個人的膂力敵不過兇猛的禽獸，於是就有羣居的現象發生，這就是團結原始的象徵；往後家族觀念興，聯同族以與異族抗；再後，國家主義起，合一國以與異國爭；一部人類史似乎無不是團結的記載。本來人類的歸宿，不在互相鬥爭，而在互相同情，不在互相排斥而在互相扶助，人與人之間，都應提出一顆赤裸裸的心，向着我們共同的目標進行，無如時至今日，在地球上還存在着少數野心者迂執的心眼，他們還在作殘人以逞的迷夢，我們爲了全人類的大團結起見，不能不作肅淸反側的壯舉，在一方面，應團結國人之力以求自立，另一方面，也要聯合全世界被壓迫的民族來共同奮鬥。西諺有云：「團結就是力量」，余觀今日之阿比西尼亞而益信。</p>

<p>— 理</p>
<p>時常碰到還未十分熟識的朋友，要我在某時某刻加入他們的方城鏖戰，可是這些好意，都被我從未打牌的怪脾氣拒絕了。說我不會打牌的原因，是因爲從小沒有適合學習的環境罷，那也不盡然，祖父叔父都是頂有興淤打牌的，並且在幼時，祖父也時常帶着我到他們的方案之一角旁，安靜地看他們拍拍的打呀洗呀的。他們打得興起，從午刻到昏黃，從黑夜到深更，我竟也能伴着坐到半夜。什麽萬子，索子，筒子，早就明白了，怎麽樣叫「碰」，怎麼樣叫「吃」，怎麼樣叫「和」，又怎樣碰法，怎樣吃法，怎樣和法，我也都早已懂得，可是我從未打過牌。</p>
<p>有的人就會這樣嘲笑我，連牌也不曉得打，還成爲現代人麼？打牌技術是交際塲中必備的一手，在他們眼里看來好像不會打牌的人簡直是現代的殘廢人，不够資格做現代人！此外，也有人說：作家們大多是熱心於賭的，曹聚仁且於回力球塲上發現了適然史觀而成一家言呢！動動筆的人而不會打牌，那不是一伴文壇笑話嗎？誠然，我不熱心做所謂現代人，也不想做作家，於是乎打牌就不必與我有緣。</p>
<p>但我還有喝酒的興趣，的確是實。</p>
<p>五年前，可說是我喝酒的高潮時代，那時生活的愁煩絞着我的心，脆薄的心弦又那麼易感地。那時只覺得需要狂哭，需要怒吼，可是那一縷縷的愁煩，却反而愈益緊束，緊束了！那時可以得到暫時忘憂的，唯有一海碗一海碗的黄湯。每天晚上，一包花生米，五六塊豆付干，五六斤濃鬰的花雕，就被我們二三個同事分灌到肚腸裏去了！每一斤朝後，大家的臉色都已緋紅，可是我的却反而愈益蒼白，狂歌狂叫之後，大家呼酒的聲浪却愈益頻繁了。從此，我脆弱的心靈便更加脆弱，易感善怒，像患有歇斯底里的女子的心緒一樣了！又一天晚上，我依然同着二三個同事在借酒澆愁，那知酒向腸里落，淚向眼中拋，狂哭狂鬧了一個整夜，每個同事都束手無策。</p>
<p>我那時是出名的二斤酒量的酒徒。若逢有機會喝灑的時候，人家無不以我爲二斤酒量者，故而灌我至沈沈欲醉。我自己似乎也每次很慷慨的表演酒醉狂生的痴態。但是，我每次喝酒之後，我痛苦的心只有更痛苦些，我的喝酒並不有如滴仙翁的雅舉的。</p>
<p>滄桑時變，舊日的酒伴都四散了，自己浪跡滬濱，所感受的艱苦並不低下於當日，然而，年齡給我一年年的敎訓，已使我一改「天眞的放浪」，而爲「沈默的悲哀」了。雖然有時也懷念到醇酒的美味，但終於很少當年的放浪的情懷了。</p>
<p>在這沈默的悲哀中，是一天天地催着我老去了。</p>
<p>旅行一週</p>
<h3 id="c172">温泉公園 <a href="#c172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— 波</p>
<p>在四川，不管是鄕村或城市，是說不上什麽建設計劃的。文化的落後使他們沒有新的科學知識，而經濟的衰落又使他們無力去從事建設。但是所有去過四川的人都會想起一個地名—北碚，這是一個新的地方，一個四川僅有的，用新的方法和科學的計劃建築起來的專供遊憇的所在。</p>
<p>從前是民生實業公司的總理，現在新被任命為四川建設廳長盧作孚氏，便是北碚的創建者。他費了幾年的時間，苦心孤詣地用個人資財把牠裝飾起來。纔不多時光呢，牠已變得這樣美麗了。</p>
<p>北碚——現在已變成北碚鎭和溫泉公園的總名了——位置於嘉陵江南岸，距重慶還不到百里·本來，北碚距溫泉還有十五里，但自從把溫泉建築了一番以後，牠們的名字便混成一處了。到現在，有人說到北碚二字，無疑地是指溫泉公園的。</p>
<p>這次我有幸運走到重慶去住一星期。重慶是那麽一僩汚穢和喧囂的地方，假若不是生活的繩子把他縛在這城市裏的人，他一定不能在此久留的。於是，當我在重慶住了三天後，便在一天早晨，帶一個手提箱，悄然走上小火輪，向北碚出發了。</p>
<p>小火輪是民生公司的，嘉陵江的航綫也是這公司所獨攬的。每天早晨五點鐘都有兩隻小火輪沿嘉陵江開到合川去，第二日再由合川開下來。北碚，便位置在重慶與合川之間。</p>
<p>輪開行時，時間很早，還不到六點鐘。輪上是那麽擁擠，嚕雜，再加上摩托的滯重的聲音，腦子便沉重起來。輪上是沒有舖位的，因爲船行的路程太短，還不到一日的緣故。因此我便倚身在欄杆上，靜看那向身後慢慢移去的靑山和波浪。</p>
<p>一個老於旅行的中年人不期然的站在我身旁了，我們　不出一般在旅途中相會的愼例，不久便攀談起來。據他吿訴我，我們現在所趁的船是上水，從重慶到合川要八九個鐘點，回來呢，却只要五六個鐘點便够了。」你不是去溫泉嗎？」他向我說「我也是的。我們要正午十二點鐘才能到達呢！但我們回來時，早晨七點鐘趁由合川開下來的船，十點過後便會到重慶。」</p>
<p>水流得很急，有些時候船很厲害地抖着，像一個發熱病的的老人。有一處船走得非常奇怪，它在江面上繞了一個大「之」字，並不在江心航行。我間　中　人，他說：這是因爲水下面有石，牛得彎彎曲曲的，很像一儲狗脚拐，所以這地名便呌狗肢拐：船是不能在狗脚拐上駛　，要在它旁邊繞「之一字；每一年，這兒總要破壞很多木船，淹死無數性命的</p>
<p>他又指給我看一個地方，在江的北岸，在一個很高的山抝中，那兒是全四川唯一有鐵路的地方。這鐵路是專作述煤用的，民生公司的煤炭廠便設在這兒。我抬頭望上去，在很高的半山間，我看見幾支在冒烟的烟囱。这时正有一列火车在半山間駛過，一下又隱在另外一座山後面去了。它看　是很小的，很像一條小小的黑蛇。中年同伴父告訴我，民生公司有三十幾隻大小輪船都是用自己廠中所出產的煤炭的。</p>
<p>船到了北碚鎭，稍停了幾分鐘。從江面上望過去，溫泉公園已經看得見了。</p>
<p>十五分鐘後我便到了溫泉公國。</p>
<p>這是一座山。望上去，所有的屋宇，革塲，菓林，都看得很淸楚。下船後我　備有着山靑石造成的很寬的石級前　。石级的两　部有　木，而竹子尤其多。上了二百级左右，　開始看見山人力拓出來的半地。我在一間很精巧的小洋房中選了一間屋子，便開始休息。這屋子面臨大江，對面與背後都是高山。題名曰數帆樓。這很好，在黄昏的時候，數一數江上來往的帆船，倒是很有詩意的。</p>
<p>隨後，我便開始我的巡行。這漲泉公園包括二里左右的寬度，牠的地位恰恰在半山間。現在已經有很多專爲旅行者方使的洋房，有望月樓，花好樓，還有那巍立於山　而少有人上去的日出閣。草地很多，總以人工的溪溝和各各菓樹。　　溫泉　　，溪水　是熱的。在東邊，有一條繞着一株葛籐而傾瀉下來的瀑布，形狀很是美觀·自然，這瀑布的水也是熱的。</p>
<p>後來，我又怱怱地踏着水門汀的小路，走向溫衆浴塲去。浴塲分房間與游泳池二種，游泳池又分內外二池。內池只有到人鵓子深的水，外池却可以表演入水姿式了。至於房間浴室，是專門爲那些羞法的太太小姐和老年人而設，靑年小夥子很少願多化一角钱去　试的游泳池只要一毛钱）。所有的水都是用竹筒從半山接下來，不管房間浴室和游泳池的水都是流動的。牠自由地流進來，到一定的限度又自由地流出去。而水的溫度是上帝派定只許高過平常人的體溫一度的。</p>
<p>我把了一毛錢，茶房便給我一條專爲客人預備的藍布短褲。我在換衣室換了衣，穿上這條布褲，便走下內池去。這池對於像我這樣不會游泳的人倒很適用，不會把你潼得落氣，又用屋子蓋着使太陽晒不着你的白皮膚。池子大約有二十碼長，寬也差不多。水是從東角上一個洞口流下來，很像一條小瀑布。有很多人便站在它下面，讓急水在自己背上濺起無數的水花。「這眞是一個好法子。」當我團　看了一遍之後便這樣想。讓泉水自然地流進內池，內池盛滿了又自然地流到外池，外池到一定限度便向山下流到嘉陵江中去。這是不費一個人照看的。</p>
<p>浴後便是美麗的黄昏來了。在我的脚下，我的頭上，我的前後左右，都是歸林的小鳥的鳴聲。隔江的北山漸漸轉成黛色了，一輪新月便從我們身背後的山巔上爬出。</p>
<p>這怎能怪北碚有小三峽之稱呢？你看，兩岸的山那麼高，又那麽峻急，水又是很湍急的，當你走到這兒時，你不會以爲神女峯就在你旁邊嗎？</p>

<h3 id="c173">勞動工具 <a href="#c173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— 景行</p>
<p>所謂勞動工具，就是用來傳達人類的勞力以作用自然的物質，而克服自然的物質，並改變其形體作用等等的工具。在古代如石器·刀·斧·鋸·錘，在近代如已經改良疲達了的複雜龐大的機器等等，都是勞動工具。勞動工具雖然是一些已經完成了的用人工變形了的死的物質，但這些东西　於人類和某社會却包含著極生大的作用和社會意義。縱然近代有些社會學者用石器，銅器，鐵器來劃分社會的時代，未免失之狹隘和不十分妥當，但於此亦可以看出勞動工具在人類社會生活過程中所居的地位之重要性了。</p>
<p>一般說來，勞動工具不但是人類與自然物質之間所行的交替的一個橋樑，並且是體現人頻和其社會生活之文野的東西。在把單一的個別的勞動工具作爲考察的對象時，固然它仍是一種完成了</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>的用人工變形了的物質死塊，是已經凝固了的勞動的生產物，但若把許多個別的勞動工具聯續起來，作一翻歷史的考察，則這東西自身就表現出一種活力，表現出一種進化的生命之內在的連續運動，甚至體現着人類和其社會之進化的運動。</p>
<p>人類的機體，他是有生命的有機物；至於勞動工具，無論怎樣包含得有人類的勞動力於其中，但終結它仍只是死的無機物（這裏當然是把牛馬牲畜除外的），彼此完全是不同類形的兩種物類。然而事實是很有興趣的，這後者的無機物質的勞動工具，它却能代替前者的有機物之人類的生理進化。因爲勞動工具在事實上都只是人類自身諸器官的延長和變形，所以勞動工具的改良和進化，就能代替人類器官的改良和進步。此如照人類的需要說，旣要能遠望廣大的天空，又要能察秋毫之末以下的微生物，所以人類的眼睛是需得大大的改良的。至少也要如猫的眼睛一樣，其瞳孔應具有極大的收縮變化性。然而人類却因爲有望遠鏡和顯微鏡的發明，有這種勞動工具來代替肉眼改進的作用，所以卽使我們的眼睛不發生如此重大的改變，也能望見極其遼遠的星體，亦能察知肉眼所不見的物質質點和微生物等等。鉗工是手指的變象，它就代替了用手拔釘的作用：鋸齒是牙齒的變象，它亦代替了用齒斷物的作用；釘耙是指甲的變象，它也代替了用指甲抓物的作用；所以有了鉗子·鋸子·釘耙，就不再需要發達手指，利牙·銳爪了，這就是勞動工具代替了生理器官的改良進步的證明。如此，一切勞動工具都不過是人類器官之向體外的延長·變形·和多樣化，複雜化而已。</p>
<p>勞動工具代替了人類生理的器官之進化，這只是它的作用之一方面。在另一方面，它也能改變人類的生理組織，人造出了勞動工具，勞動工具又能皮轉來改造人。因爲人類的機體組織，在勞動工具不斷的改變中，他也要來適應這種改變以改變自己。比如有人要問人爲甚麽不長出虎豹式的銳爪，那麽我們就說，人因爲有了鉗子釘耙等的發明，不但用不着那樣的爪，因而依於拉馬克的用進廢退說，自然它會爲鉗子釘耙代替了它的作用而退化，並且有了它反把手的功用限制了，不便握別的東西和作別的事體。又如果有人問人的腦子爲什麽特別發達，那麽我們說是因爲人有了多種勞動工具，使我們的勞動工作，方式，過程，乃至勞動對象都複雜廣大了，所以腦子在這複雜的勞動生活中，非逐漸改變自己的一切是不能適應這種生活的。由此可知勞動工具也同樣在不斷地改造人類自然的器管和機體，勞動工具的進化，在人類之自然的部分方面，卽以此代表了他是野蠻與文明，也把人的自然性由野蠻不斷地推進到文明領域，遠離動物階段。</p>
<p>勞動工具之表現人類自身的進化這種事實固然明顯，但還不及勞動工具代表着社會文化之演進的程度那件事那樣的明顯。因爲人類自身的勞力，不管它有如何偉大的使用價値，有支配自然的能力，但要達到使自己的勞動力作用於外界的自然，並且依自己的需要和目的而大量地去征服與利用自然，都必須要經過勞動工具作中介，才能轉移傳達過去，以此改變自然物。所以勞動工具是人類的勞動力的使用價値之移轉的媒介，是傳達勞動力的工具，有了它人類才能廣泛地利用外界物質來改進自己的生活，才能建造起豐富的社會的物質，卽充實社會的經濟生活。然而社會的物質之經濟生活，固然是社會的文化，而一切精神生活的豐富，一切文物制度之改良與演進，又是以最基本的經濟生活的變化爲基礎。所以社會的全般的文化之演進階段，社會的文野，也正如人類自身之自然機體的文明或野蠻，進步或落後一樣，都能依勞動工具之多樣的，複雜的，精粗的程度表現出來。如果勞動工具是幼穉的，簡單的，那麽這社會的經濟生活就必然十分鄙陋簡單，一切社會文化也就同樣的落伍，反之，則社會便是進化到了高度文明的。這我們只須觀察原始時代以石器爲勞動工具，就成野蠻人和野蠻社會生活與文化，近代的勞動工具發達到極其複雜多樣性了，近代社會文化也就進到非常複雜的高度，卽可明白。</p>
<p>勞動工具的改良進步和其複雜化，它不但能簡單地轉移勞力和其使用價値，而且還能使人類勞動力的作用及於更廣泛的自然對象，支配更廣泛的自然物，甚至增强人類的勞動效能。所以利用石器不但不能把宇宙中的水力電方收服起來供人利用，而且利用石器就是要伐倒一根樹子都非用很多的勞力和時間不可。這就是說使用的勞動工具壞了，生產能力是非常有限的，而勞動工具的進步就代表着社會生產力的發展過程。勞動工具愈落後，人類生產能力亦愈小，勞動工具愈進步，人類的生產力亦愈强，生產力的發達是由勞動工具的改良程度來决定的。然而生產力的發達却决定了社會的一切發展過程，所以勞動工具的演進也才能在這裏决定和代表社會文化之一般的發達。一</p>
<p>至於人與人的關係，嚴格地說來，也有勞動工具的决定作用參與於其間。因爲人類的社會之形成，就在於要有勞動生產，並且特別要有社會的公用的勞動工具存在，才能進行社會的生產。人自身的器瞥是個人的所有物，是不能公諸社會公用的，別人不能用我的手和足去爲他自己打人或走路，只有離開個人所有之社會的生產物那種體外器管，才是可以公用的。所以人的集體勞動這種社會關係乃是勞動工具的共同使用促成的，沒有共同可以使用的勞動工具，就不能發生共同勞動，社會生產就不能成立，人的關係便無法聯接起來。不但如此，假使你考察利用石器不能生產出比個人生活需要更多的生產品時，奴隸制的剝削就不能發生，而近代的大機械工業制的出現，怎樣必然需要工銀制的自由勞力買賣方法，和由此生產出的諸種社會關係，那麼你就可以知道勞動工具的變化也使人間關係在不斷行其相應的變化。總之，勞動工具，它不但成爲自然的人的文野進化的象徵，而且也成爲社會文明進展的指示器：它决定着社會生產力的發達程度，亦成爲人類自身之關係的產生與變化的决定的因素。</p>

<p>— 吳鶴生</p>
<p>我是世界上最痛苦的人，因爲我的人生是有缺陷的，早年我就失了脚的一部分行動的能力；同時我又遇到了世界上最難過的關口，因爲我失業了，而且已快半年了。</p>
<p>雖然我是個殘廢者，但我也做過了不少的事：自我的父親送我到上海烟紙店裏學生意以後，接着踏進木器店，鞋子莊當店員；文具公司，酒作坊裏當司賬兼管理：文化機關當抄寫，打圖樣，油印……。其間自然是經過不少難過的關口，當每次隕業轉換的時侯，更沒有一次不受過生活的威脅，然而我總是踏着沈重的步伐，埋着沉毅的心，像伍員過關一般，一重衝過一重，而且還自喜打出小學徒的圈子，給我一步一步地爬到高級文化機關的辦公室裏呢。誰料到我又是失業了！原來越爬的高（？），便越跌的厲害！</p>
<p>在上海一失業，我天天忙着這件事，東託人替我找事，西託人替我找工作，託人的結果呢？「現在失業人多了，不要說像你這樣的跛脚！」「他們都說跛脚的就不要，因爲有礙觀瞻！人們都拿這幾句話來答覆我，語氣中還帶些埋怨我不該煩他代我受辱似的。我自然沒話說；因此也沒有一次是成功。</p>
<p>失業人多了，我想是不錯的，這在現社會誰也不能避免的。可是會什麼要說「不要說像你這樣的跛脚呢？更還說什麼「有礙觀瞻」呢？難道我跛脚就不能做事麽？難道因爲我是「跛脚」，妨礙了大人先生們的觀瞻，就沒有我在這個世界上找事的權利麽？天！這是一個什麼樣的世界？難道我就只配一條永無職業的死路了？難道我因了跛脚就連生存的希望也沒有了？</p>
<p>憤慨由你憤慨，，老我自爲之，因爲這個世界是勢利的世界，你有錢，你有勢，那你卽使跛了脚，就是癱瘓了全身，也沒有什麼關係，人家或許還會祟尙你。根本還是我的命生得不好（假如說有命運的話），我沒有錢，更沒有勢，我的跛脚得不到人家的歡迎，反招來了憎惡，是必然的。</p>
<p>可是，這個世界就只有勢利的祟拜者了嗎？我不相信！我不相信！我相信我可以活下去，我相信那些透過勢利看到眞實的朋友會同情我！憐救我！</p>
<p>敬愛的朋友！你願我的生命在你的面前毁滅麽？給我工作吧！我也一樣的能够工作，一樣的能帮你的工作的完成。</p>
<p>附：不論什麽工作，我都願盡我的熱情，盡我的力去好好的幹（小販·學徒·店員·文化機關裏的抄寫，鐵筆，油印，作廣吿畫，打圖樣，等等職務都能勝任）。請不要爲我愁跑路，五里以內不要緊。我的身體很健，勞動工作也能担當。各種嗜好都沒有。最後，自然是不計薪金，只求膳宿了。</p>

<h3 id="c175">談知識份子 <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 恒</p>
<p>由於生活條件的决定，知識份子不能成爲一個獨立的人的集團：每一個知識份子都是隸為或者接近於某一獨立的人的集團的。這在另一方面也可以說每一個獨立的人的集團都有其在各方面（如在政治，哲學（文學方面）的代言人——知識份子；一般所稱的知識份子，即過去我們所稱的士，就是指某一獨立的人的集團的代言人或同情者而說的。因此，通常人們稱知識份子爲知識階級是不對的。事實上，孔孟與楊墨都是士，但我們不能說他們是同一集團；曾國藩和梁起超，林琴南和胡適，也都是知識份子，但我們也不能說他們是一個集團。</p>
<p>因爲每一獨立的人的集團都有其知識份子，故由其所領導的社會運動傀必然有知識份子參加　。知識份子自然不能單獨領導一種社會運動，完成一個偉大的歷史使命，但如沒有他，任何一個社會運動也是不會發生發展而且完成的。『五四」運動如沒有陳胡，自然會有別的知識份子來代替他們的職務，但是，假設根本沒有知識份子參加（這假設當然不會成爲現實），那「五四」運動的發生恐怕也要大成問題了吧。「秀才造反，三年不成」，但若沒有「秀才」，那就是有人要造反也造不起來。被稱爲及時雨的宋公明雖然名聞天下，但若沒有「濫秀才」央用，那他在梁山寨的第一把虎皮交椅恐怕也會坐不穩當的吧；劉備雖然英俊，但若沒有道號臥龍的諸葛亮，那他恐怕也是不能稱帝蜀中吧；漢高之得天下，張良陳一平等知識份子曾盡了很大的力量；武王伐紂的成功，他的所一謂「亂臣十人」也有很大的功績；所有這些，都足以充分表明知識份子的社會作用。所以，知識份子雖是遊離的，不能起一獨立的作用，但我們亦不能因一此將他評價過低，說他毫無用處；所謂「百無一用是書生」這一話並不是與客觀事實相合的。</p>
<p>知識份子是遊離的，他們可以爬上去也可以降下來，他一們能走進保守的陣營去努力作開倒車的工作，但也有可能成爲進步的集團的一個成員，實行推動歷史前進。在歷史上自然有許多知識份子去爲惡人作奴才，賣己害人，危害國家社會，但隨着歷史前進，不爲權威的壓迫和金錢的利誘所動而永遠忠實於客觀眞理的文人也不是就找不到。所以，我們不能因為看到歷史上幾個投機取巧「賣身投靠」的文人，便全稱肯定地說「文人無行」，說一切知識份子都是最靠不住的趨炎附勢的壞蛋！</p>
<p>同時，每一個社會運動之發生，都必然有其客觀的社會條件。至於知識份子之參加或代表某一集團去領導一個進步的社會運動，則是因爲他在其社會生活中認識了那社會發展變化的趨勢，認識了那時所發生或者所要發生的那個社會運動的意義，並不是因爲他要去爲一切知識份子爭什麽地位才那樣做的。事實上，每一個進步的社會運動，雖然有不少的知識份子能認識其意義實行去參加，但同時也有一些知識份子未能認識其意義而表示了反對的。例如國民革命的北伐運動，就是有許多知識份子參加而也有不少的知識份子反對的。如果把知識份子當作一個獨立一的集團來看待，說其參加一種</p>

<p>爭地位，因而更以單純的「自私自利」的　　夫評價知識份子之參加社會運動，完全否定知識份子的　　作用乃至其人格，那上引的事又將作如何的解釋呢？於此我希望鄙視知識份子的人們多用一次腦筋！</p>
<p>當然，就在參加進步的社會運動的知識份子中也有一些是藉着運動　發展而爬上去了的；在其爬上去了之後或當其想要爬上去時，往往又是以後退的表現去獲得其個人的現實的利益。然而，即令如此，我們也不能否認那運動的意義，否認參加運動的的知識份子已有的功績；爲了有些參加進步的社會運動的知識份子之在中途或後來「賣身投靠」而就否認運動的意義，或者因之而把運動與參加運動的知識份子對立起來，說運動雖有意義，但却不能將參加運動的知識份子與運動的意義作同樣的評價，這都是錯誤的。我們知道，一個進步的社會運動的意義是客觀地存在着的，絕不因為有幾個參加　　　　　　　　　　　　　後「賣身投靠」就消失。　如，參加辛亥革命的知識份子，到後來就有一些是去擁護袁氏做皇帝的，但歷史却不會因此就不記載辛亥革命的客觀意義。同時，我們評價一件事前，應該依據那事情所發生的客觀效果，而不應該依樣一己的主觀的猜想。某一知識份子，如果是曾經參加了某某進步的社會運動的，那即使他在中途或後來退後了，那歷史也要將他之參加那社會運動的事情如實的記載着，而日將其意義與那運動的意義作同樣的評價；因為他之參加那運動時的努力所發生的客觀效果，是有益於運動之發展的，絕不因為他在中途或後來之退後而消滅，這正如他之曾經參加那進步的社會運動不能掩飾其在中途或後來之退後一樣。就拿胡適博士來說吧，在「五四」文學革命中他是前進的，對於那時的新文化運動他有很大的功績，現在呢，他還迷戀着金元王國的文物和制度，算是早已落伍了，但　　　不能　　　　　　　　將他過去的功績公　，也不能　　過去的功績而　　其現在　落伍。所以，人們之依其一己之主觀　猜想，見到某個當經參加過　步的社會運動的知識份子在中途或以後「賣身投靠」了，便說他在參加運動時的動機就是不純正的，因而否認其參加運動的意義，甚至說運動本身也有問題，那便是不公平而日謬誤的說法。</p>
<p>我以為知識份子是遊　的，其意志是比較不很堅強的，他缺少勇氣和魄力，他能說會想，但是缺少實幹的精神，因之他本身就有許多的缺點，我們不應吹毛求疵地去過分鞭打他，應當好好地去引導他為國家社會服務。他有缺點和錯誤，我們自然　指摘出來使他注意，但他的積極的作用我們也是不能否認的。當然，像那些　識地去努力作開倒車的工作，過墮落頹廢的生活，做賣己害人的勾當的知識份子，是歷史所不能寬恕，也是我們所不能與之妥協的；我們所當引導的是一般知識份子，而不是這樣的人們。</p>

<h3 id="c176">小賣所 <a href="#c176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— 晨曦</p>
<p>長春這地方的情形，除了資本主義的氣息在這裏比較濃重之外，有些地方都和我在關內所見到的許多大都市差不多，凡是大都市所具有的富麗堂皇的外表，這裏也無不應有盡有，而其中最使人感到驚奇咋舌的，便是大批的烟館林立，烟民觸目皆是的情形。</p>
<p>據說這裏的烟館一共有五十多家，直接間接靠這過活的人不下數十萬；另外還有附設在烟館門前的「小賣所」也有百餘家。鴉片在這裏雖然也是「寓禁於征」設有專賣處，但一個外路人剛到這裏想吃牠却也不容易：這裏吃烟是有一定的場合，仿佛和上海的　裕里差不多，陌生人是無從問津的。</p>
<p>在這裏開設一爿烟館，也和上海一樣需要很多的花費：專賣署的捐欵，檢查，偵探的「黑銷」，白相人，馬路政客的「孝敬」，處處都得花錢，方可以使營業順利，十拿九穩賺錢。但是烟館老板所花的雜費，也並不是一點都不能收回：譬如附設在烟館門前的「小賣所」裏的一般小販商人，便是烟館老板收錢的對象。說起「小賣所」裏這班小販，他們自己雖不一定都吃烟，可是他們成天都要靠在「吃烟」當中討生活：因為一般上烟館吃烟的烟客，大多數都有點「口嬌」的毛病，看到了新鮮東西都愛吃那麼一點兒換換口味，因此一般小販便得在烟客的口惠下拾得那麼一點唾餘。</p>
<p>「小賣所」雖說是小，其實倒也不讓於一個趕集的會場：那裏有精製的「八寶粥」，「原湯挂麵」，「美味餛飩」「細磨杏仁茶」，另外還有什麽「熏醬牛肉」，「夾燙面火燒」，「水菓」「糖」「烟捲」等等，大槪有數十種。我們單聽那種玲瓏剔透的名詞，便會忍不住地要唾涎三尺，何况那班烟客又都是犯了「口嬌」的毛病呢？</p>
<p>烟館的門前，上午與下午情形全然不同，機關的烟客的顧臨大槪都在八點鐘，至於十時以後，陸續惠然而來的，則多屬度着安逸生活的有　階級的紳士與經商的老板，因而小賣所的門前，在上午與下午也就分出不同的情况。在十時前後，烟客認為是放光的黎明破曉，這時候對事物的選擇上自有一番講究。葷類油膩當然不宜入口，湯水過多的麵食，又嫌它有點臌脹；這時應該吃的東西就非精緻點的點心不可。所以清晨的「小賣所」門前很少看見「餛飩」，「挂麵」，甚至「八寶粥」一類擔挑：然而是生意清冷嗎？不！「口嬌」的烟客是養活小販的恩主：「喂，給我來一碗杏仁茶，掌櫃的!」凡是烟客多善於應世，雖是對一個小販，他們照例是肯用柔和的音調說話的。他們全具有一副成功的口才，這是在烟燈旁的高談闊論中訓練成的，尤其是對於普通的應世話更稱熟練：「喂，漿熱嗎？捎兩個餜子，掌櫃的！」「是嘍，你老！」「杏仁茶來了，漿子熱，你看，新炸的餜子呢！」清晨的小賣所門前是清冷嗎？不，不會清冷，小賣所是跟着烟館的時間一樣作生意；由清晨到黃昏，到深夜，烟館不絕地有烟客們光顧着，而門前的小販呢？也就不斷地作那一般「口嬌」烟客們的買賣。不過隨時問的不同，他們食品也跟着要更換：杏仁茶，豆漿，在小賣所清晨的門口，這幾種生意是最忙碌的，待日上三竿，這些老板便在洗刷着担鍋碗具了。「醬肉」，「燒餅」，「香烟捲」，「鮮果」攤，同時準備着在接替。「口嬌」的烟客們到正午也不多事大嚼，五分錢的醬肉切得「刀塊」要好，燒餅要新出爐的，五分錢的肉便可夾兩塊燒餅。這時小賣所的門前，便不見了清晨蒸氣縷縷的漿担和杏仁茶担，但趕燒舖的麺桿響，切醬肉的刀光，行人的談話，却在小賣所的門前交織起一片　雑的音調。更加上旁邊一陣水菓販的叫賣，紙捲糖老板的喊叫，在正午小賣所門前的風光，却也顯示着那叨了烟客和烟館的光的小販業絕不是被罩籠在蕭條不景氣的浪潮中。等到正午這一刹那的時間溜過了，太陽漸漸有點兒細斜的當兒，跟着煩囂而來的便是死一般的寂靜；這時候烟館的烟客的數目也减少了；一般機關職員，他們因有公事在身，叨了一點鐘左右，都得上班辦公。這時剩留在烟館裏面的，大部份是有閒階級和一些生意人；他們零落地佔據着幾床烟榻，瞇着眼躺下，這樣過去了兩三個鐘點，好像替烟館撐場面似的。到了下午四五點鐘，烟館又開始來到它一天生意中最燦爛的一個階段；那些白天工作得辛苦了的烟客，便都在這時用夜生活來作精神上的調劑；「小賣所」的門前，又換上一片煩囂的情景了。</p>
<p>「餛飩開鍋啦！」</p>
<p>「八寶粥呵！熱！」這刀般尖銳的喊叫一聲聲地透過烟客們疲乏的身心，他們的情緒便突然像學着一擊；剛要踏進烟館，立時就會拍身回來，像想起了什麽似的：「呵！肚子餓了，吃點東西再拍烟吧？」</p>
<p>小販們的怒吼是一種極有力的暗示：烟客們經過他們面前，是從來不曾被輕易放走一個的。</p>

<p>「我敢？主任辯公事很認真，都曉得是鐵面無私。」他悄悄瞧我兩眼，又補充兩句：「元太覺敵漏稅，須得嚴辦。還有小槽坊也頑皮，難得主任親自出來，非醫給一下不可！」</p>
<p>我幾乎忍不住要笑出來，他拍得我又饜，又痛，又舒服，父難過，然而這麼個味兒，我就愛他，高與他。其的，這小子有一張會說話的嘴巴，有一副伶俐的腦筋，還有一個好面龐兒。祇是心眼太壞：見人此打算盤。老實脫，假如我不是在官塲里多跑了幾年腿，也許還要吃他的虧呢！不過話得說回來，他那壞心眼，卻中了我的心坎：幾次的財喜，都是他幫著挽圈圈，幾次弄僵了事，都靠他轉彎兒。所以我很瞧得起他，今天又帶他一道。真的，我這人架子雖大，卻得愛惜人才；譬如剛纔我惱他，無非為了故意算計我，其實這也是受了自尊心的驅使，祗要這點傻勁一過，還不又要同他商量今天的問題！　（未完）</p>

<p>攝製費用一百萬金鎊</p>
<p>英國倫敦影片公司，以前曾經有過好幾部著名出品，像「英宮秘史」「凱塞琳女皇」和「紅花俠」等，在中國開映時，均曾轟動一時。那時該公司有兩位巨頭：一位是亞歷山大柯達Alexander　Korda。一位是陶白士白L．Toeplitz，但是陶白士後來不久就和倫教脫雕，自己另外組織一家陶白士製片公司。他本來是英國的一位大富翁，經濟方面是可以沒有問題的。他的宗旨是每年僅攝製影片四部或六部，不過每部都是鉅片，第一部就費了一百萬金鎊攝製「丹宮恨史」Lover　ofA．Dotator一片，（片已到滬，不久即將在上海公映了。）並特地請了大導家維克多薩維爾去担任本片的導演工作，還將好萊塢的明星克拉夫勃洛克和英國的紅明星曼琳卡洛羅致以去，担任片中的主角，所以公映之後，在歐在美，均博得極佳的讀譽，預料將來在上海公映的收穫，當不致遜於一英宮秘史」等片，並聞好萊塢的希佛萊，亦受了陶白士的聘請，第二部出品，就是請他担任主角，這的確是英國銀擅上的一種好現象吧！</p>
<h3 id="c180">大偵探拍戲記 <a href="#c180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>——攝影塲上笑料之一——</p>
<p>「翡翠馬」中的大偵探王微信，對於禁毒的案件，確是非常地努力，隨時都在籌劃破獲的方法，祇要得到一點綫索，立時就率隊出發。</p>
<p>這天，大偵探王微信探得明星公司霹天攝影塲上有大批毒犯正在運輪毒物，便趕忙地帶著眾弟兄，手執武器，從化裝室裏奔出，直殺攝影塲而來。這天記者恰巧在塲。兩方面械鬥之情形，緊張恐怖，安能不記。</p>
<p>話說，主使兩方面械鬥之導演者徐欣夫高站在張方桌上，大氣呼著：「預備！殺呀！」</p>
<p>於是老王跨上了公安局的卡車（自然是假的），運毒者亦跨土運毒汽車，兩方面開足馬力，對面對直衝而來，大偵探看見毒犯的車子，已離面前不遠，便趕忙地將卡車橫停在馬路的中心，攔住毒犯的去路，一面開槍射擊，運毒者見此情形，豈肯示弱，亦開槍還擊，於是好戲開塲，『哪啪』之聲隆起，情形頓時緊張，令人毛發悚然。大偵探之槍口對準其毒犯預備射去，那知某毒犯的背後站著一個看拍戲的密司，見這情形便驚呼失色，反身便跑，像是真的有槍彈將落在她身上似的，弄得四座皆狂笑不止。這塲械鬥，結果「老槍」吃　，棄車而逃，好在有導演徐欣夫高聲喝止，窮寇莫追，好戲就此告終。</p>
<p>記者走上前去，握著老王的手，稱讚他的槍法美妙，老王帶著幾分歉意地說道：『那裏，那裏，誰也不怕我這支木殼槍呵！』</p>
<p>「剛才那位密司不是　您弄得大驚失色嗎」？</p>
<p>老王不禁大笑了起來，他告訴我：「訴多攝影塲裏的參觀者，他們的表情，往往比演員還要來得深刻，他們的表情，往往比演員還要來得深刻，演員在鏡頭前面笑，他們亦笑，演員在鏡頭前面哭，他們亦哭，剛才我就注意了您的表情，比那位密司還要深刻裏！」</p>
<p>被他這麼一說，記者到有點難為情越來了，想想剛才自己的表情，寶在有貼尷尬，便頭也不回地溜出了攝影塲，心裏只暗暗地佩服大偵探真不愧為大偵探，不備槍法美妙，並且還眼快手快，連參觀者的表情都逃不過他銳利的目光。</p>

<h3 id="e11">Prospects for the British General Election <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>The British Parliament was dissolved on the 25th of last month. The new parliament will be formed after the general election on the 14th of this month. This matter has significant implications for British domestic and foreign policy. In recent days, the propaganda competition among the various parties has reached its most intense stage. Before the final results are revealed, we may as well make a concise analysis of the current competitive situation of the various British parties and the significance contained in this general election.</p>
<p>The British Parliament that was dissolved this time was elected in the autumn of 1931. According to the usual practice, without the occurrence of special problems, it should have come to a natural end after the five-year term expired, and a general election would have been held in the autumn of next year. The early dissolution and re-election now is a strategy of the Conservative Party. Originally, after the 1931 parliamentary election, due to the speculation of some leaders of the Labour Party and the Liberal Party, they formed a mixed cabinet with the Conservative Party. They called it the National Cabinet, but in reality, it was based on the strength and policies of the Conservative Party. In the autumn of 1932, the Conservative Party convened the Ottawa Conference to promote its protectionist trade policy. Some Labour Party and Liberal Party speculators, such as Snowden and Samuel, were forced to withdraw from the cabinet due to disagreements. Since then, the power of the Conservative Party has developed by taking advantage of the situation. Some Labour Party and Liberal Party leaders who clung to their positions, such as MacDonald and Simon, also became more bureaucratic and completely became puppets of the Conservative Party. However, in the recent year or two, the rise of Germany's military strength has created serious problems in European diplomacy. The continuous increase in unemployment figures in the United Kingdom has allowed the strength of the Labour Party's left wing to penetrate deeply into the masses. At this critical moment, MacDonald's obedience and Simon's mediocrity could neither provide a rallying call nor arouse the aversion of some Conservatives, who regarded them as obstacles to their policies. Thus, in the early summer of this year, Conservative Party leader Baldwin transformed from a behind-the-scenes figure into the leading actor in person, with the calm and experienced Hoare as the foreign secretary and the young and handsome Eden traveling between Geneva and the capitals of various European countries. The purpose of this reorganization of the lineup was to cope with the upcoming general election. When the Italo-Ethiopian dispute suddenly intensified and the British maritime transportation "lifeline" was threatened, this traditional national defense and diplomatic issue attracted the attention of many citizens. The Conservative Party rulers seized this opportunity and decided to dissolve parliament early, attempting to use the general public's anxiety about the outside world to achieve the goal of winning the election.</p>
<p>Judging from the general trend, this Conservative Party strategy can be successful. There are currently 1,295 parliamentary candidates, of which the ruling party accounts for 557 and the opposition party accounts for 738. Among the opposition parties, the Labour Party accounts for 540, the Liberal Party accounts for 175, the Independent Labour Party accounts for 21, and the Communist Party accounts for two. There are more than 600 seats in the House of Commons. Because there is no possibility of a coalition between the Labour Party and the Liberal Party, the ruling party can easily occupy a majority. In fact, the only party that can currently match the Conservative Party is the Labour Party. However, the bureaucratization of some Labour Party leaders in 1931 dealt a major blow to the party. The death of Henderson and Ponsonby this year, as well as the recent resignations of party leader Lansbury and Cripps due to the issue of sanctions against Italy, have made it impossible for the party to reorganize its ranks in the near term of the general election to fully deal with political enemies. The Conservative Party is launching a general election at this time, precisely because it has seen the Labour Party's weakness. Therefore, the Conservative Party's victory is generally not a problem. However, the Labour Party has made significant progress in several local elections this year. Although it has failed in various urban areas in England and Wales recently, it still has the upper hand in Scotland. Therefore, it is still doubtful whether the Conservative Party can achieve an overwhelming victory. The new front formed by Snowden, Lloyd George, and Samuel can also maintain the declining power of the Liberal Party to some extent so that it does not entirely tend to the Conservative Party.</p>
<p>But even if the Conservative Party can win, it will not be easy to maintain its advantage in the future. The issues that have become the subject of contention in the British domestic and foreign policy elections have always been the issue of protectionist and free trade, the issue of Indian autonomy and direct rule, the issue of national defense, and the issue of unemployment, etc. According to recent trends, it seems that the two main issues are whether to maintain peace externally and whether to reduce unemployment internally. The British people's war-weariness can be seen from the experimental vote in the spring of this year. This time, the Conservative Party government's support for the League of Nations and its advocacy of sanctions against Italy are aimed at catering to the psychology of the voters. But on the one hand, they are clamoring for peace, and on the other hand, the Conservative Party government is still strongly advocating expanding the navy. In other words, the Conservative Party rulers are attempting to continue their imperialist armed policy under the guise of maintaining peace. This smoke screen will still reveal flaws in the near future. Because the increase in the burden of military spending makes the national economic life more painful. At the same time, the number of unemployed does not decrease, then the Labour Party's policy of striving for peace externally and eliminating unemployment internally will attract more people's attention. As long as the international situation changes, we may soon see this effect.</p>

<p>Addis Ababa - A plane was reconnoitering in the skies here today, believed to be an Italian plane. If confirmed, this would be the first enemy plane to appear here since the Italo-Ethiopian conflict. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Italian troops on the northern front occupied Magale without resistance. Italian troops on the southern front also achieved an important victory today, occupying Gorahai, which is actually the central hub of the Ogaden province. It is generally believed that the fall of Gorahai will allow Italian troops to drive straight to Harar, which is the main destination of the Italian troops attacking from the Somaliland direction. The fall of Gorahai was the result of a fierce attack by troops led by Colonel Maletti. The Ethiopian troops defending were demoralized by the air bombardment and fled in panic, with many captured. At the same time, according to Ethiopian sources, the town of Dagah Bur, 125 miles southeast of Harar, was heavily bombed by Italian planes today, dropping no less than a thousand bombs, causing many casualties among Ethiopian soldiers and civilians, and great losses of property. The Ethiopian garrison commander also died of his injuries. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian troops' occupation of Magale yesterday has completed the second stage of its bloodless war on Ethiopia. The third stage is to clear and merge the entire territory between the Takkaze River, the Goba River, and the Dobaat River. The latter two rivers are tributaries of the Takkaze. Italian troops will build the best roads to the front lines, including a main road from Magale to the mouth of Massafa, which is the port of Elitri, about 70 miles southeast of Massawa. At the same time, it is reported that Italian troops are currently clearing land several miles outside Magale, and engineers are preparing to build roads in front of the main position. Italian troops may continue to advance bloodlessly to the large mountain range in front of Aba Arage. It is expected that the Ethiopian troops will make their first fierce resistance there. General Gasa is currently stationed there with 50,000 Ethiopian troops. It is expected that there will be no major war until the Italian troops have advanced to the fourth stage, which may have to wait until after Christmas. By then, if the Italian troops can occupy Aba Arage, then the entire province of Tigray, south to Lake Ashangi, and the land of Kunlen in the Danakil province, will all belong to the Italian troops. Today, the official here declared that since the start of the war, the Italian troops have suffered a total of one officer killed, four injured, three non-commissioned officers killed, six injured, and ten indigenous soldiers killed, and seventy-one injured. (8th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>Harar - A large number of Ethiopian troops ordered to resist the Italian troops in the Ogaden province retreated into Harar today. Thousands of mixed troops are stationed in the streets of this town, still unaware of the cruelty of modern warfare. Belgian military expert Vetme told the Associated Press reporter that the troops resisting General Graziani are a motley crew. They have no organization, no training, no military knowledge, and the supply is quite poor. According to Vettme, these troops have eaten up all the local food and are now starving because the officers lack the knowledge to supply military food. It continues to rain in the Ogaden province today, and malaria is becoming more rampant among the troops. The morale of the troops in the Gorahai area is said to have been shaken due to frequent air raids, disease, and lack of food. (8th National Telegram) The southern front of the Italian army, the southern front of the Italian army is pursuing the Ethiopian army, with a tendency to go straight to Harar. Its planned military plan is to pass through the Ogaden province and engage General Nasibu's troops in the vicinity of Harar and Jijiga. The tribal army collapsed after being bombed by Italian planes, and the armored vehicles immediately tracked down and occupied Gorahai. So far, General Graziani has used it as an operations base. The Italian army's southern front has now penetrated 660 miles into Ethiopia. (9th National Telegram)</p>
<p>(Rome) The general opinion is that there will be a possibility of compromise only after the Italian army occupies Gorahai in the south of Ethiopia and Magale in the north. As for the declarations made by the United States, Brazil, and Germany on the issue of neutrality, they are of great concern to Italian people. It is generally believed that there will inevitably be conflicts within the governments and business circles of countries implementing sanctions. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) It was learned today that the Ethiopian government has used cash to order a large number of ammunition, rifles, and machine guns from a well-known British arms factory. The funds came from the Ethiopian Emperor's private treasury and the contributions of various Ethiopian chiefs. The Ethiopian Embassy in London has received donations of about 500 pounds, and the donors are voluntary, mostly without signing their names. Ethiopia has also ordered guns and cannons from Belgium and Czechoslovakia, with the same value as those purchased from the United Kingdom. It is also heard that some of the Belgian military supplies have been transported to the port of Djibouti in French Somaliland and will soon be transported into Ethiopia.

<p>Addis Ababa - This agency's special correspondent, O'Cheyna, reports that Ethiopian government officials declared that if Italian troops have occupied the town of Gorahai, it is because the Ethiopian soldiers and civilians there had already withdrawn from it. However, the town of Gorahai is an ordinary water supply point and not an important strategic location. Even if it falls into the hands of the Italian troops, it will not harm Ethiopia. As for the Ethiopian government, it has neither verified nor denied the news of the Italian troops' occupation of Gorahai. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian army's capture of Magale and the recovery of Aduwa have the same important historical significance. The city of Magale is 3,040 meters above sea level, with high terrain, overlooking the entire province of Tigray. In the battle of 1896, Italian Major Galliano led 20 officers, 13 non-commissioned officers, and 1,000 soldiers, holding the Magale fortress for 42 days. Ethiopian General Mekonnen attacked with 100,000 men, and the fortress was eventually lost. Until the outbreak of the recent war, Italy sent a commercial delegation to reside in the city, and in 1932, an airfield was built in Magale. On the first of this month, construction began on the road from Magale to Adua. (8th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>Asmara - The highway from the city of Asmara to the port of Massawa was officially completed recently. The road is 130 kilometers long and is used to supply the Italian army's rear. A total of 10,000 Italian workers, 2,000 Eritreans, and 1,000 Arabs and Libyans were hired to build the road. When the road was being built, it was the hottest time of the year, and many road construction workers died from overwork. (9th Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) Today's official report stated that when the Italian army occupied Gorahai, the Ethiopian army abandoned hundreds of cannons, machine guns, and rifles, as well as several heavy trucks loaded with food and military supplies. An Italian detachment is now pursuing the Ethiopian army, not stopping due to the flooding of the Fafen River. The official report did not mention that two hours after the Italian army occupied Magale, engineers built an airfield. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>

<p>(London) London officials today denied rumors of Anglo-Italian naval treaty negotiations, dismissing them as absurd. Such rumors likely arose from a misunderstanding of Anglo-Italian expert talks in London or the meeting between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and British Ambassador Drummond in Rome. In reality, the naval experts merely exchanged opinions on future naval conferences. It is widely believed that British Ambassador Drummond's meeting with Mussolini two days ago made progress towards resolving tensions in the Mediterranean. The British Ambassador will meet with the Italian Prime Minister again tomorrow, at which time further progress may be made, but as of now, no agreement has been reached. (Reuters, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) According to reliable sources today, an Anglo-Italian naval agreement has been established here, stipulating that Britain no longer opposes Italy's construction of two 35,000-ton battleships. Experts today believe that this agreement indicates Britain has effectively ceased opposing tonnage reductions, while simultaneously maintaining the current gun caliber of battleships. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(London) Anglo-Italian naval expert talks have concluded. According to official sources, these talks were merely for exchanging opinions, with the intention of preparing for the naval conference to be held in London on the 5th of next month. Naval figures commented on the Anglo-Italian naval talks, saying that if future naval conferences discuss naval issues from a political perspective, the conference will inevitably fail. Previously, Italy had proposed internationalizing the Strait of Gibraltar. Although Italian experts did not mention this matter this time, there is still a possibility that it will be brought up in future conferences. Furthermore, Japan advocates that all naval powers should enjoy equal rights to the same security. It is evident that the discussions at the future conference may not be limited to technical issues.

<h3 id="e21">The Suez Canal's Position in the Abyssinian-Italian War Emergency <a href="#e21" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c21" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">21</a></h3>
<p>— Zhong Zu</p>
<p>During this tense period of the East African war, the narrow, 100-mile waterway connecting the Mediterranean Sea and the Red Sea is completely in the spotlight. Its origins have a complex history. Before this canal was dug, ships sailing from Europe to the East had to round the Cape of Good Hope to enter the Indian Ocean. For centuries, many dreamed of a waterway between the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea to facilitate trade. In 1799, Napoleon wanted to find a shortcut to India for the French army through the Suez Strait, and sent engineers to survey the area. In the 19th century, with the rapid expansion of the Industrial Revolution, the need to complete the canal as soon as possible became even more urgent.</p>
<p>When the plan to dig the canal was first rumored, the most vocal opponent was Britain. Although the canal would benefit her, she had significant interests in the Near East and India, and feared that the convenience of transportation would threaten her power from other countries. Thus, she obstructed all plans to dig the canal in every possible way, and insisted on maintaining the trade route around the Cape of Good Hope.</p>
<p>As such, the Suez Canal's opening plan was shelved. In 1834, Mohammed Ali Pasha, the Turkish governor of Egypt, intended to excavate, but upon learning that this would endanger his position in Egypt, he dismissed the idea. In 1841, Arthur Anderson, manager of the Peninsular and Oriental Company, submitted a plan to the British Foreign Office to dig the canal, which would shorten Britain's route to the East by thousands of miles, but the British government did not accept it. In 1847, French advocates drafted a new plan to dig the canal, but the British still thought that the route was just an unrealizable fantasy.</p>
<p>However, later, the public opinion of Western European countries supported this plan, and at the same time, they obtained the consent of Said Pasha, the Turkish governor of Egypt, so Britain's opposition gradually eased. In 1854, Said granted a preliminary concession to French engineer Ferdinand de Lesseps to organize the Suez Canal Company (Compagnie Univereselle du Canal Maritime de Snez), stipulating that the canal "should be open forever as a neutral waterway through which any merchant ship could freely pass."</p>
<p>The canal was opened in 1869, and the ideal that British politicians had long feared finally became a successful reality. After the opening of the canal, all countries expressed great concern about the legal status of the canal. Although the company's articles of association stated that merchant ships or warships of all countries could pass through the canal in times of war or peace, this statement was not legally binding under international law. At the same time, both Britain and France wanted to cultivate power in Egypt, and their mutual jealousy was very strong. Therefore, the Turkish government, the suzerain of the Suez Canal Company, convened a conference of European countries concerned in Constantinople in 1873, and jointly declared that warships and troop carriers could also pass through the canal under the principle of equality. In this way, the status of the canal was generally determined, having been removed from the governance of one country and placed under the joint protection of Europe. Two years later, the British government purchased 44% of all shares in the Suez Canal Company from the Egyptian Khedibe Ismail, with the clear aim of taking a share of its management rights.</p>
<p>At that time, the rebellion of the Egyptian Governor Arahi Pasha gave Britain the opportunity to occupy Egypt. In 1882, disregarding the protests of the canal company, Britain occupied the canal in the name of the Egyptian King, landed troops, and levied canal tolls. In 1883, the British Foreign Office, on behalf of the Egyptian King, issued circulars proposing suggestions regarding the canal. The general idea was that the canal should not be regarded as neutral. In practice, ships of any country should be able to pass through in times of war or peace, but hostile acts were prohibited within the canal zone, and the Egyptian government was responsible for protection.</p>
<p>France saw Britain's power in Egypt increasing day by day, and feared that it would hinder the free passage of the canal. Other European countries also considered the declaration of 1873 to be too simple, and there were no regulations for important matters (such as the question of whether the canal would remain open in the event of war, when the local government was also one of the belligerents). Therefore, in 1885, the eight major countries convened in Paris to discuss how to guarantee the right of free passage through the canal. France advocated for international joint management, and Britain advocated that it must be protected by the local government, so there was no result. In 1888, Britain and France reached an understanding and established the Eight-Nation Canal Convention. The convention's seventeen articles stipulated that the canal would be managed by an international committee, but although the committee had the right to observe the implementation of the treaties, it was actually unable to fulfill its obligations. If the safety of the canal or its free passage was obstructed, the committee could only meet to exchange opinions, and the final measures would still have to be decided by the Egyptian government (Khedivial Government). This was what Britain considered satisfactory. In 1904, Britain and France mutually recognized each other's positions in Morocco and Egypt, and concluded an agreement. In the agreement, the original validity of the Canal Committee was further reduced, and even the annual routine meeting disappeared invisibly.</p>
<p>During the Spanish-American War, Spanish warships traveled to the Philippines via the Suez Canal, prompting the US Secretary of State to ask the British government whether the United States, which was not a signatory to the Suez Canal Convention, could also send warships through the canal. The British government replied that there was no distinction between signatory and non-signatory countries, and there was absolutely no problem. During the Russo-Japanese War, Russian warships freely entered and exited the canal. After the outbreak of the Italian-Turkish War, the Egyptian government invoked the power stipulated in the 1888 Canal Convention, and did not allow five Turkish warships to dock in Port Said, and disarmed them. Before the Great War, there were generally no changes in the passage of belligerent ships through the canal.</p>
<p>Once the Great War broke out, due to its vast scope, the position of the Suez Canal underwent drastic changes. Turkey joined the Allied Powers, and Egypt declared itself a British protectorate. Britain, having become a belligerent enemy with Turkey, invoked the Canal Convention to deploy a large army along the canal and in Egypt. All ports in Egypt became war ports, and the Suez Canal became the communication line of the Allied Powers.</p>
<p>Since 1914, the Suez Canal has effectively become a British waterway. Not only were ships of enemy origin considered suspicious and impounded, but German merchant ships that had entered the canal area early by invoking the 1888 Canal Convention were also ordered to leave by the Egyptian government. For example, the German merchant ship (Gntenfels Prize) and others were forced to leave the canal area and were captured by British warships. The Egyptian Maritime Prize Court ruled that they would be confiscated on the grounds that although these ships were allowed to pass freely through the canal, they were not allowed to linger in the canal, using it as a port of refuge (Court User of the part as a part of refuge) because this behavior would endanger the position of the canal.</p>
<p>Since the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian War, and with the increasing tension between Britain and Italy, the above-mentioned complex relationship has begun to rekindle. If Italy were to destroy Abyssinia in one fell swoop, both Egypt and Britain would be in immeasurable danger. Because if Italy controlled Lake Tana, the source of the Blue Nile, Egypt would starve. As for the threat to Britain, it is even twofold. Her special interests in Sudan and Egypt would be shaken, and the Suez Canal itself would be in extreme danger, because the canal geographically relied on the Nile River's irrigation in Cairo. Moreover, the Italian Eastern Expedition may also cause unrest among the natives of Sudan, Egypt, and other British territories in Africa, and endanger British rule.</p>
<p>Based on the failure of the peace negotiations coordinated by Britain, France, and Italy in 1906, Britain has, on the one hand, urged the League of Nations to impose economic sanctions on Italy, and on the other hand, has gathered fleets in various parts of the Mediterranean, preparing to confront with force when necessary. If the Anglo-Italian war breaks out, the Italian fleet will have no chance to pass through the canal. Although there is a legal basis on the Italian side, guaranteed by the 1888 Canal Convention and the 1904 Anglo-French Joint Declaration, if we examine Britain's attitude towards the canal since its opening, we can know that when the interests of the British Empire are seriously threatened, she will not hesitate to cut off the Suez artery. Isn't the measure taken against German merchant ships during the Great War a prominent precedent?</p>

<p>(London) The British Trade Union Congress recently issued a campaign manifesto defending the Labour political program, saying, "The current government is called the National Cabinet, but in reality, it has always been controlled by conservatives. The National Cabinet's policies are to serve landowners, industrialists, shipowners, farmers, and other classes, while ignoring the working class. In the economic field, since taking power, the National Cabinet has only known how to implement tariff restriction policies, and has not restored the prosperity of world trade. In the diplomatic field, its adherence to the collective peace system is not what it desires in its heart. For many years, the National Government has repeatedly hindered the actions of the League of Nations in Geneva, but now it boasts of supporting the League of Nations, while at the same time, it does not hesitate to squander huge sums of money to replenish its military equipment. It can be said that it is self-contradictory. As for the Labour Party, it has always sincerely supported the League of Nations, and the collective peace policy is advocated by the Labour Party, and only the Labour Party can implement it," etc. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>

<p>(Washington) Canadian Prime Minister King met with Secretary of State Hull today to discuss reciprocal tariff issues. King is scheduled to meet with President Roosevelt this afternoon. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Diplomats here believe that if President Roosevelt's negotiations with Canadian Prime Minister King to increase commerce between the two countries are successful, it will promote cooperation between the two countries in the Pacific. Common problems between the two countries, such as adjusting the expansion of trade with Japan and strategic assistance during this period of intense competition on this coast, are the background for the two countries' active negotiations. However, officials deny that the talks between the two will discuss political issues. Canada's trade with the United States now exceeds that of all countries. The total import and export trade in 1934 was $533,000,000, compared to $498,000,000 for the United Kingdom and $329,000,000 for Japan. However, diplomats believe that if tariffs can be reduced, the exchange of goods between the two countries will increase even more, and the sympathy and trust between the two countries will become more consolidated. Canada has hundreds of miles of land between the United States and Alaska. If a war breaks out in the Pacific, it will be difficult to connect the air forces of the two places. Therefore, the United States hopes to reach an understanding with Canada, stipulating that the air force can pass through Canadian airspace to reach Alaska. Canada will also have to rely on the protection of the US Navy if a major war breaks out in the Pacific. Canada's adjustment of tariffs on Japan will also depend on whether it can obtain the US market to sell its goods. (National Telegram, 8th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) The newly appointed Mayor of Beiping, Qin Dechun, took office at the municipal government at 9 a.m. this morning. More than one hundred people, including section chiefs from various departments, bureau chiefs, and staff members, gathered in the auditorium. More than one hundred guests attended, including Tang Yulin, He Jingwu, Ding Chungao, and Shao Wenkai. Qin said in his speech: "This time, Dechun has been ordered to come and lead Beiping City. I deeply feel that my talent is meager and that I am shouldering the government's trust and the expectations of the local people. I can only be down-to-earth and encourage myself together with my colleagues in the municipal government. Generally speaking, I feel that there is no good way to deal with the current situation. Mr. Song (presumably Song Jiaoren) once said to deal with everything with 'sincerity.' Our country is a land of etiquette. We meet with etiquette and associate with righteousness. We must achieve good neighborliness and protect overseas Chinese. Internally, we must first stabilize people's hearts, preserve our inherent morality, and cultivate a spirit of law-abiding. We must actively seek out the people's hidden needs and build upon Mayor Yuan's policies during his tenure. Plans that benefit the people's livelihood will continue to be implemented to the extent that financial resources allow. To ensure the stability of the lives of city residents, we will pay attention to the suffering of the lower classes and the economy of city residents. In terms of developing the city's appearance, I will use talent as the standard for determining who to retain and who to dismiss in the future." (9th Special Dispatch)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Qin Dechun issued a written statement saying that Beiping is a historical and cultural capital. He is deeply ashamed of his inability to fulfill his duties. In these difficult times and unique circumstances, the only thing he can do externally is to be sincere, observe etiquette, and fulfill his responsibility to be a good neighbor and protect overseas Chinese. Internally, the only thing he can do is to reassure the people, observe their hidden needs, uphold morality, promote the rule of law, and seek effective assistance from officials and civilians. All reasonable plans of previous administrations should be continued until they are completed. However, Beiping is experiencing an economic depression in all sectors, especially in the countryside. In the future, the main focus of municipal administration will be on stabilizing the lives of city residents and revitalizing the city's economy to seek a stable and upward financial situation. Only on this foundation can all municipal undertakings be sustained and operated without error. As the ancients said, "Governing does not lie in much talk." He wishes to emphasize practice and avoid extravagance. He hopes that all advanced individuals and enlightened members of the press will provide guidance and assistance at any time.

<p>(Tokyo) Ding Shaoji, Counselor of the Chinese Embassy in Japan, visited Vice Minister Shigemitsu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 4:30 p.m. on the 8th to explain the urgent and unavoidable reasons for the Chinese government's implementation of currency reform and to report on the situation after the reform. (9th Japan United Press Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) The Times published an editorial today stating that the dissent advocated by the Japanese at the beginning of the announcement of China's currency reform has now been greatly reduced, and the purpose of this reform has been understood. British diplomats may eventually assist the Japanese Foreign Minister in explaining to them that the proposals offered to the Chinese Ministry of Finance by Sir Leith-Ross, the British government's economic advisor, do not contain any dark anti-Japanese conspiracy or Chinese rearmament plan. However, before carrying out such diplomatic action, the British authorities should pay attention to eliminating a local cause of discord between Britain and Japan. The Japanese demand for greater say in the affairs of the Shanghai International Settlement is approaching, and the Japanese may intensify their demands as before, because the Japanese know that other countries are now concentrating on the struggle between Italy and the League of Nations and have no time to care about other matters. The Times means that the Shanghai issue must be thoroughly studied first, and when it is raised in the future, it must be handled with caution. If things are neglected, it will obviously double its difficulty and may cause danger.</p>
<p>(Washington) Financial figures, in view of the stability of the Shanghai silver dollar price since Monday and the various manifestations of China's currency control policy, increasingly believe that the Chinese government's management of the new currency system has hope of success. Therefore, financial circles are no longer paying attention to China's new policy. The Treasury Secretary's remarks yesterday were sufficient to confirm that the United States has no intention of disrupting China's finances. Officials expressed no knowledge of the British proposal to lend China 10 million pounds. (8th National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3 id="e41">Hong Kong Bans Silver Exports <a href="#e41" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c41" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">41</a></h3>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong Legislative Council resolved at noon on the 9th to prohibit the export of Hong Kong silver dollars, Mexican silver dollars, Hong Kong dimes, and silver ingots from today. The Treasury Secretary will collect and store silver coins in designated banks as a guarantee for issuing one-dollar banknotes as legal tender and will also issue nickel coins to replace the current one-dime and five-cent silver coins. (9th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) Reuters has learned that the reason why the Executive Council meeting today did not decide on the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is that powerful financial circles oppose this proposal. The one-dollar banknotes that the Hong Kong government will issue are not intended to replace the existing banknotes of various banks, but only to replace hard currency, and are not intended to be in permanent circulation, but only as an emergency plan to maintain the supply of small-denomination currency. It has now been negotiated with various banks to issue one-dollar bank notes. When one-dollar bank notes are sufficient for use, it is planned to no longer issue government one-dollar banknotes, and those that have already been issued will be gradually withdrawn. The full text of the Hong Kong government's ordinance governing the issuance of one-dollar banknotes is as follows: This ordinance may be called the Silver Dollar Banknote Ordinance of 1935. The Financial Secretary may legally issue or reissue one-dollar banknotes in Hong Kong. This banknote shall be legal tender for the payment of any amount. The Financial Secretary shall establish a banknote guarantee fund. All funds received for this banknote shall be entered into this fund. This fund will be deposited in one or more banks in Hong Kong. The Financial Secretary may withdraw the amount he wishes to withdraw at any time. A portion of this fund may be temporarily invested by the Financial Secretary depending on the circumstances. (9th Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong government today ordered a ban on the export of all kinds of silver. The Executive Council convened a special meeting in the morning to discuss this case and subsequently issued an order that took effect at noon.

<p>(Hong Kong) The Hong Kong government will issue one-dollar banknotes and five-cent and ten-cent subsidiary coins. Hong Kong's circulating banknotes have a minimum denomination of five dollars. A special ordinance passed by the Executive Council allows the issuance of these currencies and allows the Hong Kong Financial Secretary or those ordered by the Financial Secretary to be exempt from the silver export ban.

<h3 id="e60">China's Coal <a href="#e60" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c60" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">60</a></h3>
<p>— Edited by Tang Qingzeng; original work by W. Belden-M. Salter, translated by Ziming</p>
<p>China's coal deposits are distributed throughout the country, with the largest reserves in Shanxi and Shaanxi provinces. The reserves in other provinces are generally sufficient to meet local needs. The output of Xinjiang, Qinghai, and Gansu has not been thoroughly surveyed. In the southern provinces of mainland China, coal seams are mostly exposed on mountain sides, making local mining very easy. Chinese geologist Weng Wenhao once said, "In Yunnan, one can travel fifty miles without seeing an exposed coal seam, which is unheard of. Fujian is rich in coal production. Even the poorest families use coal day and night, as it is more economical than extinguishing and re-igniting the fire." Shanxi and Shaanxi have extremely large coal reserves but very little output. Kailuan Coal Mine, although not large in reserves, is very important due to its convenient mining and transportation.</p>
<p>The coal deposits in the three northeastern provinces are mostly located deep within the Changbai Mountain range, making mining very inconvenient. The most important are the Fushun, Benxi Lake, and Yantai coalfields, which are mined by the Japanese. Their output accounts for 80% of the total output of the four northeastern provinces. The total output of the Northeast in 1931 was 9,000,000 tons, with this area accounting for 7,200,000 tons. In addition, there are still unexploited reserves in Muling and Mishan in Jilin, the Hegang in Heilongjiang, and Beipiao in Rehe. The coal resources in these areas are of poor quality and cannot be used for coking, so their industrial applications are limited. The coal from Kailuan and Benxi Lake can be coked and has extensive industrial and naval applications.</p>
<p>Shanxi and Shaanxi have extremely large reserves of anthracite and bituminous coal, but due to inconvenient transportation and difficult transport, the mining industry is underdeveloped, resulting in very little output. It is a great pity that the goods are abandoned in the ground. The main transportation line in the area is only from the plain to Taiyuan, and the high freight costs naturally preclude its use for transporting coal. Currently, the coal mines being mined are mostly in the Fen River valley and the southeastern border connecting the North China Plain, where the population is also denser.</p>
<p>Fushun Coal Mine has a good location and convenient transportation. The South Manchurian Railway even has a branch line to Fushun. The mine is located on the coast, making transportation to Tianjin very convenient. Kailuan coal can now be exported through the Qinhuangdao ice-free port, making it even more convenient.</p>
<p>Currently, there are forty-eight modern coal mines nationwide, of which only 33% are mined with Chinese capital, 30% with Japanese capital, and 10% with British capital. Kailuan and Fushun both use modern mining methods, and the coal pits in Fushun are particularly impressive. The largest mine pit has been mined for seventy years and is now two hundred feet deep.</p>
<p>The coal in Shandong is of excellent quality and easy to transport. Many mines are using modern mining methods. The Zhuangzhongxing Coal Mine can be said to be a model coal mine. The monthly income of the workers in the mine ranges from 7.5 yuan to 58 yuan, which is enough to support their entire families due to the extremely low cost of living.</p>
<p>There are approximately 200,000 miners in China, including those working in both new and old mines. Each person can mine 0.35 tons of coal per day, which is only 126 tons per year. In comparison, Belgium produces 200 tons per person per year, the United Kingdom 225 tons, and the United States 688 tons. The efficiency of Chinese coal mines is far behind.</p>
<p>China has the largest coal reserves in the world. We believe that to find ways to mining, there must be four prerequisites: (1) Develop transportation infrastructure; (2) Stabilize politics and finance; (3) Develop other industries; (4) Accumulate capital and technical personnel.

After the review, Tada read the Emperor's edict and held a debriefing to assess the strengths and weaknesses of the exercise. It concluded around 1:00 PM. The troops stationed in Ping left Tianjin at 4:10 PM. The troops along the Shanhaiguan and other lines left Tianjin at 2:25 PM. The participating troops in this exercise included infantry, cavalry, artillery, communications, and medical teams from Beijing, Tianjin, Tanggu, Shanhaiguan, and Tangshan, totaling over 1,200. In the exercise on the 4th, the Beijing troops were designated as the Red Army, commanded by Hasegawa, and the Tianjin troops as the Blue Army, commanded by Kayashima. Initially, the Red Army advanced south from Beijing and encountered the Blue Army from Tianjin in Langfang, resulting in an engagement. The Shanhaiguan and Tangshan troops, designated as the Blue Army, received reports and deployed a train overnight to provide assistance. They disembarked at the An Ding and Wei Shanzhuang stations. As the Red Army was advancing from Fengtai, a train carrying reinforcements arrived, leading to a major field battle between the Red and Blue armies near Wei Shanzhuang on the morning of the 5th. Around 3:00 AM on the 5th, the Red Army's reinforcements were cut off, and they gradually retreated. The Blue Army gradually gained the upper hand. By the evening of the 5th, the Red Army was overwhelmed and retreated from Huangcun. They crossed the Yongding River at night, pursued relentlessly by the Blue Army, resulting in a night battle on both sides of the river. By the morning of the 6th, the Red Army occupied the commanding heights of Changxindian on the west bank of the Yongding River, encouraging the troops for a final stand. A battle ensued in the morning, and by noon, the Red Army, with united efforts, finally defeated the Blue Army. This was the situation of the first stage of the exercise. In the afternoon of the 6th, the second stage of the exercise began. The Shanhaiguan Blue Army was assigned to attack Tianjin. In the afternoon of the 6th, a train carrying troops departed from Shanhaiguan. At that time, the Red Army was far away in Beijing and was ordered to urgently reinforce Tianjin. In the afternoon of the 6th, three trains were dispatched. Only one train passed the Luofa station before the railway bridge was blown up by the Blue Army (simulated). The soldiers on the remaining two trains disembarked locally and traveled to Tianjin by car, arriving in the vicinity of the Tianjin East Bureau successively in the evening and deploying defenses. The Blue Army's train advanced to Lutai and discovered that the railway bridge and tracks had been destroyed in advance by the Red Army. They disembarked in Tangshan and advanced towards Dongfengtai. They gathered at the Junliangcheng dormitory overnight, preparing for a dawn attack on the 7th. Tianjin felt threatened, and 69 veterans and 64 teachers and students from youth schools, along with 36 commercial school students, were temporarily organized into a volunteer corps, commanded by the director of the Veterans Association branch, Tian. They assisted in guarding the outskirts of Tianjin and dispatched a unit to enter Junliangcheng to disrupt the Blue Army's rear. The remaining troops from the Japanese Garrison in Tianjin at the Haiguang Temple, including all tanks and armored vehicles, were dispatched to Haixia, Chentangzhuang, and Zhangguizhuang, harassing the front of the Blue Army in Junliangcheng, hindering their advance. By 5:00 AM on the 7th, the Blue Army launched a full-scale attack, employing new weapons and chemical warfare tactics, with simulated skirmishes and hand-to-hand combat, using blood and flesh as projectiles. The exercise was realistic. It concluded at 8:00 AM. The victory in the Tianjin suburban defense battle belonged to the Red Army. (7th)</p>
<h3 id="e66">Wuhan Party, Government, Military, and Business Sectors Jointly Discuss Prices <a href="#e66" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c66" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">66</a></h3>
<p>Organize Price Evaluation Committee to Curb Excessive Inflation Provincial Bank Issues Subsidiary Coins to Address Copper Coin Shortage Legal Tender Foundation Established, Foreign Merchants Universally Use</p>
<p>Hankou Dispatch: After the currency reform in Wuhan, although market transactions continue as usual, commodity prices have soared, and copper coins are difficult to exchange, inevitably causing disturbances. Despite the joint efforts of officials and merchants to maintain stability in recent days, no satisfactory result has been achieved. Among foreign merchants, HSBC (British) and Citibank (American) were the first to accept legal tender, while others temporarily observed. As of today, Mercantile Bank (British), Deutsch-Asiatische Bank (German), Banque Belge pour l'Etranger (Belgian), Yokohama Specie Bank (Japanese), Bank of Taiwan (Japanese), Hankou Bank (Japanese), and Banque de l'Indochine (French) have also continued to adopt legal tender. Consequently, companies such as Méts &amp; Co. (American), Standard Oil (American), Anglo-Swiss Condensed Milk Company (British/Swiss), British-American Tobacco Company (British/American), Tsuda &amp; Co. (Japanese), Toyo Cotton Company (Japanese), Nissin Trading Co. (Japanese), Mitsubishi Corporation (Japanese), Abe Trading Co. (Japanese), Kyoei Trading Co. (Japanese), Ki Lai Trading Co. (Japanese), A.S. Watson &amp; Co. (British), Iwai &amp; Co. (Japanese), British American Tobacco Co. (Daxie Tobacco Company), Long Mao Trading Co. (Jin Long Trading Co.), Texaco (American), De Fuyou Company (German), have followed suit, fully resuming operations. In addition to the legal tender issued by the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China, the notes issued by the Jiangsu &amp; Zhejiang Commercial Bank, Zhejiang Industrial Bank, Commercial Bank of China, Bank of China, Farmers Bank of China, China Peasants Bank, and Hubei Provincial Bank are also circulating in the market. Outside of Wuhan, in counties and cities such as Yichang and Shashi, the Central Bank, Bank of Communications, and Bank of China have branches. The shortage of copper coins is felt in Wuhan and other places, making it difficult to travel by boat or car. Yesterday, the authorities stipulated measures to deal with hoarding by foreign merchants, but they were largely ignored. Today, the Chamber of Commerce decided that the Provincial Bank would issue subsidiary coins of 100 cash to circulate throughout the province, while strictly cracking down on hoarding by unscrupulous merchants. It is reported that the Ministry of Finance will also issue one-fen copper subsidiary coins and five-fen subsidiary coins to circulate nationwide. If they can be minted soon, it may be sufficient to meet the demand. Due to speculation by unscrupulous merchants, prices of various commodities are increasing daily, and the prices of daily necessities are skyrocketing, which is currently the most serious problem. Although prices have stabilized slightly under the strict orders of the government today, it cannot be considered that the situation has been alleviated. The Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, Hankou Municipal Government, Bankers Association, Money Dealers Association, and General Chamber of Commerce held another emergency joint meeting today, deciding to organize the Wuhan Price Evaluation Committee to limit the excessive price increases in the three towns of Wuhan. The committee will be jointly organized by representatives from the Hubei Provincial Party Headquarters, Hankou Municipal Party Headquarters, Hubei Provincial Government, Wuhan Garrison Headquarters, Hankou Municipal Government, Wuhan three chambers of commerce, and the Bankers Association. Attached to the Provincial Government, it will have staff assigned by various agencies and organizations to investigate prices at any time. If the committee deems that prices are rising excessively, it may request the competent authorities to take effective measures. If it is found that there is a shortage of certain goods, it will also consult with the competent authorities and the local chamber of commerce to find ways to raise funds for procurement and make adjustments. It is expected that the committee will be established and start work tomorrow. Minister of Finance Kong expressed concern about the discount on banknotes in Hankou. On the 6th, he telegraphed Hankou Mayor Wu Guozhen and Public Security Bureau Chief Chen Xizeng, ordering them to strictly crack down on it. The telegram stated, "This unified issuance and centralized reserve is an essential plan for stabilizing finance and reviving the economy. All provinces and cities are unanimously complying. The Hankou Chamber of Commerce has already sent a reply stating that it will fully comply. It has been reported that there is a discount on banknotes in Hankou, which must be due to a few unscrupulous merchants trying to profit from the opportunity. I hope that you two will strictly investigate and prohibit it and clearly explain the situation. If anyone violates the law again, please punish them according to the law to deter others and facilitate implementation. [Seal of Kong Xiangxi]" Mayor Wu replied today, "I have received your telegram. The Money Dealers Association of this city issued a public notice on the 4th stating that the exchange rate for ten-day deferred Shanghai drafts would deduct three yuan in silver, which has been stopped and corrected. There is currently no discount on banknotes. The market situation is currently good, but the price of copper coins has risen, making small-scale trade difficult. In addition to the municipal government convening the Chamber of Commerce and money dealers to set a legal exchange rate of six strings of copper coins per yuan and prohibiting the outflow of copper coins from the urban area to provide relief, are there any other methods to adjust the situation? Please advise. It is also reported that the high price of copper coins is the same in all places. It seems that your ministry should quickly determine a subsidiary coin solution to facilitate circulation. Respectfully, Wu Guozhen, Mayor of Hankou [Seal]" (7th)</p>
<p>Songjiang County Government Convenes Rice Stem Borer Meeting</p>

<h3 id="e67">How the Sun, Moon, Stars, and Planets Move and the Phenomena Resulting from Their Motions (II) (Lectures to the National Public on October 18th, 21st, 27th, and 28th) <a href="#e67" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c67" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">67</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Zungui, Researcher at the Institute of Astronomy, Academia Sinica</p>
<p>Among the nine major planets, besides the Earth, there are eight others. Of these eight, Mercury and Venus are closer to the sun than the Earth, meaning their orbits are inside the Earth's orbit. Mars through Pluto are farther from the sun than the Earth, meaning their orbits are outside the Earth's orbit. Astronomers call the planets with orbits inside the Earth's orbit "inner planets," and those outside "outer planets." The apparent motion of inner and outer planets as seen from Earth is different.</p>
<p>When an inner planet, the sun, and the Earth are in a straight line, it's called a conjunction. Conjunctions are divided into superior and inferior conjunctions. When an inner planet appears behind the sun, meaning the sun is between the Earth and the inner planet, it's called a superior conjunction. When an inner planet appears in front of the sun, meaning the inner planet is between the sun and the Earth, it's called an inferior conjunction. Now, please prepare a piece of paper and a pencil. Draw two concentric circles on the paper, meaning two circles of different sizes with the same center point. Assume the center is the sun, the inner circle is the orbit of an inner planet, and the outer circle is the orbit of the Earth. Pick any point on the outer circle, for example, point A. Connect point A to the sun, and it will intersect the inner circle at one point, for example, point B. If the Earth is at point A and the inner planet is at point B, this is called an inferior conjunction. If you extend the straight line between points A and B, it will intersect the inner circle at another point, for example, point C. If the Earth is at point A and the inner planet is at point C, this is called a superior conjunction. During a superior conjunction, we see it moving from west to east, which is direct motion. During an inferior conjunction, we see it moving from east to west, which is retrograde motion. Also, the orbit of an inner planet is smaller than the Earth's orbit, so the distance between them and the sun, as seen from Earth, is limited. Venus cannot exceed 46 degrees, and Mercury cannot exceed 28 degrees. Because of this, we can only see Venus and Mercury in the early morning or at dusk. Mercury is very small and its maximum distance from the sun cannot exceed 28 degrees, so it often appears and disappears around the sun, making it very difficult to observe. Venus is what we in ancient China called the Taibai Star. Its distance from the sun can reach 46 degrees, so often when the sun is about to rise, all other stars are invisible, but Venus can still be recognized in the eastern sky. In ancient China, we called it the Morning Star, which is Venus at this time. Also, when the sun has just set and other stars are invisible, only Venus shines brightly in the western sky. In ancient China, we called it the Evening Star. So, the saying "East has the Morning Star, West has the Evening Star" refers to different names for the same Venus. When the distance between Venus and the sun is 39 and a half degrees, its luminosity is greatest during inferior conjunction, meaning that Venus can be seen even during the day for about 36 days before and after its inferior conjunction. It takes about 500 days for Venus to complete one inferior conjunction cycle, so its brightest appearance may not be seen at all in a year, or it may be seen twice in a year. For example, Venus was in inferior conjunction with the sun on September 8th of this year, so it was brightest about 36 days before that, around August 3rd. At that time, newspapers in Beijing and Shanghai reported news of seeing celestial bodies during the day, which was the period when Venus could be seen during the day. Also, 36 days after September 8th, that is, on the 15th of this month, it will be brightest again. So, Venus has two periods of peak brightness this year.</p>
<p>The above describes the situation of the inner planets. Now, let's talk about the outer planets. When an outer planet, the sun, and the Earth are in a straight line, it's called a conjunction when the sun is between the outer planet and the Earth, and an opposition when the Earth is between the sun and the planet. Referring to the diagram drawn above, assume the inner circle is the orbit of the Earth and the outer circle is the orbit of an outer planet. This means the Earth is at point B and the outer planet is at point A. This is called opposition. Extend BC and it intersects the outer circle at point D. When the Earth is at point B and the outer planet is at point D, this is called conjunction. Outer planets mostly move from west to east, with only slight retrograde motion around opposition. The opposition of Mars is most famous in astronomy.</p>
<p>The above describes the motion of planets and satellites as seen from Earth. Now, fourthly, we want to talk about the motion of comets. Comets are commonly called broom stars. What we usually see are stars with long tails. They also orbit the sun, but their orbital shape is not a near-circular ellipse like planets. It is a long ellipse or even a parabola shape, or even a hyperbola shape. Comets with elliptical orbits return once at a certain period, which is called a periodic comet. For example, in the second year of Xuantong (1910 AD), we saw a very large star with a long tail, which is called Halley's Comet. Its orbit is elliptical, and it orbits the sun about every 76 years, so we can predict in advance that this comet will reappear in 1986. There were also records of comets appearing in the 15th year of Daoguang (1835 AD), the 24th year of Qianlong (1759 AD), and the 25th year of Kangxi (1682 AD). These comets are also returns of Halley's Comet. If we go further back, we can know that the earliest historical record of the appearance of this comet was in the seventh year of Qin Shihuang (240 BC). Since then, it has returned 29 times. Before the development of human science, it was believed that the appearance of a comet meant that some disaster was about to happen. Most strangely, after the appearance of Halley's Comet in the second year of Xuantong, the Qing Dynasty ended. The people at that time were still superstitious. Now, according to historical records and the observations and calculations of astronomers, it has been clearly proven that this is the motion of a comet. We can not only know the past appearances of comets, but also predict future appearances, so superstitious ideas have naturally been broken.</p>
<p>Fifth, is meteors. We often see points of light flying across the sky at night, which are meteors. Although meteors are tiny dust particles in the universe, their motion is not random. They often form groups and orbit the sun, mostly following the orbits of comets. Sometimes comets disappear after several orbits, but the meteors orbiting along its orbit continue to be observed, so we can also say that meteors are the remains of comets. Meteoroids are at different distances from the sun, so their orbital speeds are also different. Thus, they gradually distribute themselves along the orbit. The longer the time, the longer the orbit, resulting in a long elliptical ring of dust. Because of the relationship between these elliptical orbits and the Earth's orbit, certain groups of meteors appear on certain dates each year.</p>
<p>In short, in the solar system, except for satellites that orbit planets, all celestial bodies revolve around the sun as the center. So, the sun is the master of the solar system. As for why the stars orbit the sun and why their orbits are elliptical, this has to do with the effect of universal gravitation. It's a bit specialized, so we won't talk about it for now. Now we want to talk about the motion of the fixed star sphere.</p>
<p>We have already said above that the positions of fixed stars are permanently fixed, but upon detailed study, they are absolutely not fixed. They also change, but they are so far away from us that it's not easy to detect with our eyes. The arrangement of the stars in the sky changes naturally after a certain number of years, but the change is very small. For example, take the Big Dipper. What is the Big Dipper? Everyone knows that when we look north at night, there are seven bright stars arranged in the shape of an iron. That's the Big Dipper. The position we see now is three stars in the handle and four stars in the ladle. Now, please prepare another piece of paper and a pencil, and draw the shape of the Big Dipper on the paper, with the mouth of the ladle facing up and the bottom of the ladle horizontal. Each star has a name, starting from the first star at the end of the handle, called Yaoguang, Kaiyang, Yuheng, Tianquan, Tianji, Tianxuan, and Tianxu. These are astronomical names. Now, for convenience, let's temporarily use 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7 as their names. Connect them with lines in order, and their current position is 1 and 2 parallel to the bottom of the ladle, forming a horizontal direction. 2, 3, and 4 are almost in a straight line, slightly to the lower right. Also, the lengths of 1-2, 2-3, and 3-4 are almost the same. 4-5 folds further to the lower right. 5-6 is the bottom, and 6-7 folds back to the upper right. Its length is about the same as 4-5. You can tell this shape by looking at the sky.</p>
<p>But 200,000 years ago and 200,000 years later, their positions will be completely different. Now, let's talk about 200,000 years ago. Their shape at that time was that the four stars in the handle, 1, 2, 3, and 4, were almost in a straight line, and the length of 1-2 was longer than the combined length of 2-3 and 3-4. 4-5, compared to 5-6, did not fold upwards to the left as it does now, but slightly upwards to the right. 6-7 folded diagonally upwards to the left, meaning that the mouth of the ladle was wide at the top and narrow at the bottom. At that time, the mouth of the ladle was narrow at the top and wide at the bottom, and the diameter of the mouth was almost only half the length of the bottom. Also, the length of 6-7 was half longer than that of 4-5. Now let's talk about the shape 200,000 years later. At that time, 1-2 will not be horizontal, meaning it will not be parallel to the bottom of the ladle, but in a direction perpendicular to the bottom of the ladle. 6-7 will be diagonally to the right, but slightly above the bottom edge, meaning one side of the ladle will move outward, and the long diameter of the mouth of the ladle will be more than twice the length of the bottom edge. Looking at it this way, 200,000 years ago or 200,000 years later, we definitely cannot call these seven stars the Big Dipper anymore, because their shape is no longer a dipper shape at all.</p>

<p>China General Edison Granted Permission to Solicit Donations on Buses</p>
<p>According to the China News Agency, since the beginning of summer this year, continuous heavy rains have occurred, and floods have occurred successively in the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins. The situation is unspeakable. The fund-raising team of the Shanghai Flood Relief Association, in order to increase donation income, specially mobilized the city's Boy Scouts to appeal for the victims and set out to solicit donations. According to Mr. Li Dachao, Deputy Director of the Fund-Raising Team, who spoke to reporters, about 6,500 people set out to solicit donations today (i.e., yesterday), and started soliciting donations in the areas that had been assigned in advance. And people from all walks of life, because the disaster situation this year is particularly serious, were all happy to donate. So the results today are exceptionally good. And the Shanghai China General Edison Company, because it greatly admires the Boy Scouts' participation in the disaster relief movement, specially sent a letter to the Boy Scouts Board of Directors yesterday, granting permission for three Boy Scouts to solicit donations on each tram. It is reported that this measure will also be implemented simultaneously today. Everyone's enthusiasm is very admirable. It is hoped that donations will continue to flow in to benefit the disaster victims. In addition, the Flood Relief Association Fund-Raising Team and the Boy Scouts Board of Directors, for the sake of caution, all Boy Scouts participating in this fund-raising effort wear a piece of white paper with a red cross on their chest. It is hoped that all sectors of society will pay attention to this.</p>

<p>The Deputy Government's Hard Work to Stabilize the Currency System, Hoping to Elevate the National Economy to Prosperity</p>
<p>The Shanghai Bankers' Association telegraphed the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating that the government's promulgation of the currency system reform measures can save the economic crisis, stabilize the people's hearts, and hope to elevate the country to prosperity. The telegram stated: "To the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: We have received your Qian Zi No. 50 order, and we have learned that the government, in order to revive the economy, has announced that, starting from the 4th of this month, the banknotes of the Central Bank, Bank of China, and Bank of Communications will be legal tender, and has stipulated six measures, instructing us to follow them accordingly. Upon investigation, since the drastic changes in the world's silver prices, the domestic economy has been affected, and silver has been continuously flowing out. Although measures such as levying silver export taxes and equalization taxes have been adopted, they have ultimately failed to prevent the outflow of northern resources. The lifeline of the national economy is at risk. The Ministry has resolutely announced currency system reform measures to save the crisis, which is a matter of urgency. However, at the beginning of the establishment of the government, there are many aspects to be considered. Upon careful examination of the announcement, there are already plans for the matters that should be established and reformed, and they are waiting to be implemented in order. By advancing step by step, it will not be difficult to achieve the wish of economic recovery. The Association, as a financial collective, will sincerely support the government's hard work to stabilize the currency and hope to elevate the national economy to prosperity. We should telegraph a reply. We hope you will grant your attention to our request." The Shanghai Bankers' Association bows in respect.</p>

<p>Preparatory Committee for Issuance to Hold Second General Meeting; Municipal Chamber of Commerce Notifies That All Negotiable Instruments Must Be Written in National Currency</p>
<p>Following the Ministry of Finance's announcement that the notes of the Central, China, and Communications Banks are legal tender, the Central Trust Bureau will establish a special department for real estate mortgage loans to invigorate the real estate market. The Preparatory Committee for Issuance will hold its first general meeting to approve procedural rules and discuss all matters related to the operation. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has announced that all negotiable instruments must be written using the term "National Currency." Details are as follows:</p>
<p>Preparatory Committee to Hold General Meeting</p>
<p>After the establishment of the Issuance Preparatory Management Committee to manage the reserve funds for legal tender and handle the issuance and exchange of legal tender, in addition to dispatching committee members to investigate the reserve funds of various banks, Xu Kan and others have completed drafting the procedural rules. These have been revised by the Standing Committee and will be submitted for approval at the second general meeting before being implemented. The detailed rules specify concrete measures for managing the reserve funds for legal tender and for the issuance and exchange of currency.</p>
<p>Decision to Handle Real Estate Mortgages</p>
<p>The Ministry of Finance, recognizing that real estate is the most significant form of collateral, and noting that its drastic price decline has affected industry and commerce, has decided to amend the regulations on real estate mortgages and establish a real estate mortgage bank to invigorate the real estate market. It is reported that the Central Trust Bureau will establish a special department for real estate mortgages, designating funds for handling real estate mortgage matters. This is because the regulations of the Central, China, and Communications Banks, as well as the Banking Law, stipulate that they cannot engage in real estate mortgage business.</p>
<p>Negotiable Instruments Must Be Written Using the Term "National Currency"</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce yesterday issued a notice to all members, stating, "To Whom It May Concern: We received a letter dated the 6th of this month from the Bankers Association, stating that they had received a telegram from the Tianjin Bankers Association on the 4th, stating that the Ministry of Finance has issued a nationwide order that, from the 4th of this month, the notes of the Central, China, and Communications Banks are legal tender. All transactions involving cash should comply with this order. After a joint meeting of our two associations, it was resolved that, from the 4th of this month, all negotiable instruments issued by various firms must be written using the term "National Currency." Negotiable instruments issued before this date, and those issued by customers after the 4th of this month that still use terms such as "silver dollars," "foreign silver," "silver yuan," or "foreign silver," will all be treated as "National Currency" and settled using the notes of the Central, China, and Communications Banks. In addition to sending separate letters, we are sending this special telegram to request your attention and relay this information to your esteemed Chamber of Commerce." Upon receiving this, we are issuing this notice to request your attention and compliance. With best wishes for your prosperity.</p>

As for the money market, the overnight rate remains at 16 cents, which proves that the Shanghai financial market and foreign exchange rates have stabilized.</p>

<p>Since its establishment, the National Foreign Trade Association has actively been contacting domestic manufacturers to promote national goods overseas. It is now learned that, due to the increasing number of national goods being produced, the association believes that raising standards is essential to gain a foothold in the international market.

<p>Preparing Petition to Appeal to the Capital</p>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce has appointed Zheng Zenan as its representative, along with Ying Xinyi, the national representative of the grain merchants, to petition the Fifth National Congress to abolish the additional tax on bran under the agricultural special tax in Guangdong Province. The original petition states: "Petition concerning the collection of agricultural special tax and additional tax on bran in Guangdong Province, which violates the Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period and the administrative order for reducing taxes, respectfully requesting that the order to abolish the tax be forwarded to uphold the legal system and benefit the people." The case was received on the 7th of this month from a joint letter from the Grain, Oil, and Cake Trade Association and the Oil Pressing Factory Trade Association, stating: "Our country is a unified nation and should have unified tax regulations. Article 62 of the Provisional Constitution of the Tutelage Period stipulates, in its third clause, against multiple taxes; in its fifth clause, against unfair taxation of goods imported from other regions for the benefit of one region; and in its sixth clause, that transit taxes on various goods should be restricted by the central government through law to avoid the following abuses. However, Guangdong Province now collects an additional tax on bran and a special tax on other agricultural products, which, according to the Provisional Constitution, should be prohibited. Regarding the additional tax on bran, in December of the 21st year of the Republic of China, the Guangdong Finance Special Commissioner's Office announced that fertilizer materials such as locally produced bean bran in Guangdong and other provinces would be exempt from additional fees. Furthermore, in May of the 23rd year, the Southwest Political Affairs Committee reiterated the order that only bean bran from the Three Eastern Provinces would be subject to fees. However, starting from September 1st of this year, the province suddenly overturned the previous administrative orders, levying a fee of 25 cents per dan on all bran, regardless of whether it is produced in the Northeast or elsewhere. This is tantamount to encouraging the import of northern products and blocking the sales of domestic products. In recent years, over twenty new oil factories have emerged in Shanghai, Hankou, Wuxi, Wujin, Kunshan, and other places. Bean cake and peanut cake produced by these factories are essential for farmers as fertilizer, and their sales volume is largest in Guangdong Province, making it a new type of industry. Now, facing this blow, it is tantamount to cutting off their livelihood. Forced to suspend operations and transportation, it has been over two months, and the impact has further pushed farmers in the bean-producing areas of eastern Henan, northern Anhui, and Shandong, as well as merchants engaged in the trading and transportation of beans and bean cakes, to the brink of ruin. Even the farmers of Guangdong Province can hardly bear this additional burden. It can truly be said that it has hundreds of harms and no benefits. This is why we must vigorously fight for the abolition of the additional tax on bran. Regarding the special tax on agricultural products, when Guangdong Province established the Agricultural Special Tax Bureau in the 18th year of the Republic of China, it was originally said that the special tax would be levied on imported agricultural products to prevent dumping. However, as a result of the tax collection, products from provinces such as Jiangsu, Shandong, Henan, Anhui, and Jiangsu were also taxed, and farmers, merchants, and transporters were restricted. This has been the case for many years. Recently, a foreign firm from a certain country transported foreign rice to Shantou, claiming a trade agreement and refusing to pay the special tax. At the same time, some people have organized a joint-stock company, hoping to transport duty-free soybean and miscellaneous grains from the Three Eastern Provinces. Under these circumstances, the so-called special tax on agricultural products may not be levied on foreign goods, while domestic grain merchants transporting soybean oil and peanut oil pay 5.4 yuan plus three commissions per dan, or 7.04 yuan in Guangdong currency. Calculating the tax rate, the tax alone is 30-40% of the value. The huge harm suffered by farmers and merchants across the country from this heavy tax on domestic products is self-evident. This is why we must vigorously fight for the abolition of the special tax on agricultural products. In short, if Guangdong Province does not immediately abolish the additional tax on domestic bran and the special tax on agricultural products, the market for bran and agricultural products in the province will be completely monopolized by foreign goods. In today's world, countries are widely implementing economic controls to prevent foreign dumping and protect their domestic industries. Guangdong Province is doing the opposite, and the harm to the national economy and the people's livelihood is not insignificant. The merchants believe that the tax system should be unified, domestic products should be protected, and the hardships of the people should be alleviated. Therefore, we have jointly requested Gu Xinyi and other representatives of the grain, oil, and cake industries from all over the country to petition the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party, requesting your association to appoint a representative and prepare a separate petition to jointly appeal to the capital, striving to have the issue of the additional tax on domestic bran and the special tax on agricultural products resolved at the Fifth National Congress and a telegram sent to Guangdong Province ordering its abolition. We will be endlessly grateful." Upon receiving this, after the abolition of likin, provinces should no longer levy taxes on goods transported between them, except for customs duties. This is stipulated by the Provisional Constitution and is the administrative order that should be followed after the abolition of likin. According to estimates from the industry, this tax in Guangdong Province amounts to a massive 30-40% of the value, and it is levied in the name of taxing imported goods, but in reality, it is levied on domestic products. Even foreign merchants can resist paying, while Chinese merchants have no way to avoid it. This is even more harmful than the likin system of the past. Moreover, heavily taxing agricultural products goes against the national policy of rescuing rural areas and focusing on the people's livelihood. Over the years, merchants and the people have appealed to the government and the Guangdong authorities about this matter, but to no avail. We have no choice but to disregard the risk of intrusion and sincerely petition your esteemed association, hoping to use the party's highest power to achieve a uniform tax system and administrative orders across the country. This is how unity is maintained, and this is how farmers and merchants are benefited. Therefore, we have appointed Zheng Zenan as our representative, along with Gu Xinyi, the national representative of the grain, oil, and cake industries, to personally present the petition to your esteemed association, humbly requesting your acceptance and resolution to send a telegram to Guangdong Province ordering the abolition of the aforementioned special tax and additional tax, which would be truly beneficial to the public. Respectfully submitted to the Fifth National Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Municipal Land Bureau Plans to Draft Land Mortgage Regulations <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Aiming to Facilitate Mortgage Convenience and Capital Circulation; Centralizing Power in Local Political Organs; First Need to Adapt the Judicial Yuan's Interpretation</p>
<p>Landowners in this city often mortgage their properties to banks and money lenders for business purposes to facilitate capital circulation. However, due to Interpretation No. 493 of the Judicial Yuan, the auction of mortgaged property must be implemented only after a court judgment has been finalized, causing difficulties for mortgagees. It is now learned that Director Cai of the Finance Bureau, concurrently serving as Director of the Land Bureau, is making efforts to reorganize land administration, seeking ways to adapt to the needs of facts and environment and planning for flexible handling. A draft of the "Provisional Measures for Implementing Land Ownership Certificate Mortgages in Shanghai" is being submitted for approval. Whether these measures conflict with the law awaits legal experts' study. We will now present the details of these measures:</p>
<p>Reason: The circulation of capital in Shanghai is largely dependent on land mortgages, allowing for the borrowing of funds from banks and money lenders at any time. Banks and money lenders that accept land mortgages can easily re-mortgage them to foreign banks. Those who use title deeds to borrow from foreign banks can mortgage up to 80% of the market value of the property. However, now, even mortgaging 20% of the assessed property value is often undesirable. Although the market is experiencing tight credit and banks have too many mortgaged properties, this is one of the reasons. However, the main reason why banks are unwilling to accept mortgages is Interpretation No. 493 of the Judicial Yuan, which states that to execute a mortgage, a court judgment must first be requested and finalized before an auction can be carried out. Since this interpretation, the mortgagee cannot directly auction the property when the mortgagor's debt reaches the repayment period and has not been repaid. Thus, the lending of funds lacks rapid and effective protection. To facilitate the circulation of capital and make real estate a valuable asset, it is essential to find a way to allow mortgagees to directly auction the mortgaged property when the repayment period is reached and has not been repaid, in order to provide relief. From an economic perspective, the above interpretation example cannot remain unchanged. The law should adapt to facts and environment and be changed so that it can meet the needs of society. Moreover, Article 873 of the Civil Code stipulates that the mortgagee, if the debt has reached the repayment period and has not been repaid, may apply to the court for auction of the mortgaged property and receive repayment from the proceeds. According to this provision, the exercise of mortgage rights does not require a finalized judgment. It seems that Interpretation No. 493 of the Judicial Yuan is inconsistent with the original intention of Article 873 of the Civil Code. The basis of this interpretation is that the registration law and auction law have not yet been formulated, and this is not sufficient to show prudence. However, the Real Estate Registration Regulations were approved for adoption by the National Government on August 12, 1927, and the Shanghai Court continues to handle registration, still using the above-mentioned legal examples. On the one hand, registration is continued according to law, and on the other hand, the credibility of the current law is denied, which seems to undermine the dignity of the law. Moreover, the Civil Code of Property Rights Enforcement Law was promulgated by the National Government on February 10, 1930, and implemented on May 5, 1930. The Land Law, published by the National Government on June 3, 1930, in its second section, has stipulated land registration. Article 32 of the same law explains the meaning of land registration. Land registration refers to the registration of land and its fixtures, which, when compared with Article 66 and Article 758 of the Civil Code, shows that the land registration of the Land Law is the registration law mentioned in Article 3, paragraph 1 of the Civil Code of Property Rights Enforcement Law. That is, these laws and regulations have been formulated and promulgated, and the Enforcement Law has also been formulated and promulgated, but there has been no order to designate the enforcement area. The executing agency for this law is the Land Bureau, which is the land administration agency referred to in the Land Law. The Shanghai Land Bureau has been established for a long time. Since laws have been formulated and there is an agency to enforce them, if an order is issued designating Shanghai as the enforcement area, the reason that the execution of mortgage rights must be resolved through a court judgment no longer exists, and there is a considerable solution to the rapid execution of mortgage rights. As for the execution of the auction procedure, although the auction law has not been formulated, it is still prudent if the proof of legally registered rights is obtained. Even if a new auction law has not been formulated, there seems to be no need to worry excessively. Before receiving the order to designate Shanghai as the land law enforcement area, it is appropriate to draft measures to remedy the situation. The Land Bureau has long handled the registration of mortgage rights, and the registration of mortgage rights is also very cautious. Mortgage registration cannot be carried out unless the property has been surveyed, the property rights have been proven, and a land ownership certificate has been obtained at the time of setting the mortgage. Since the property rights have been proven, there is no problem. When the mortgagor fails to fulfill the contract, only the auction procedure needs to be executed, without the need for further court adjudication. This is a natural fact. However, in order to ensure fairness in the execution of the auction, the Land Bureau should send personnel to supervise it. The Land Bureau is clearer than the court regarding the land ownership restrictions in Article 14 and the use restrictions in Article 151 of the Land Law. If there is any disagreement, the Land Bureau will provide the court with the evidence of property rights and the auction situation for reference. If this is done, the interests of both the mortgagee and the mortgagor can be taken into account, and the execution of the auction procedure can be simplified. Based on these reasons, the proposed measures are as follows:</p>
<p>Measures: Draft of the Provisional Measures for Implementing Land Ownership Certificate Mortgages in Shanghai. Article 1: Land within this city that has been surveyed, its property rights have been proven, and a land ownership certificate has been obtained, or land that has a perpetual lease, and its mortgage rights have been registered with the Land Bureau in accordance with the Shanghai Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules, may execute mortgage rights in accordance with these measures. Article 2: If the mortgagee's debt has reached the repayment period and has not been repaid, and the mortgagor has been urged to perform but has still not repaid, the mortgagee may directly hand over the matter to a well-known auction house in this city for execution of the auction and receive repayment from the proceeds. However, two weeks before handing over the matter to the auction house, the following items shall be reported to the Land Bureau: 1. The registration number of the mortgage, as well as the date of its registration. 2. Proof that performance has been urged after the repayment period has expired. 3. The name of the auction house and the date of the auction. The aforementioned auction house shall report its capital amount and business status to the Land Bureau for registration, and the registration regulations shall be determined separately. Article 3: When mortgaged property is auctioned, the mortgagee shall apply to the Land Bureau to send personnel to supervise the proceedings. Article 4: If the mortgagor disagrees with the implementation of the auction of the mortgaged property, before the establishment of the Land Tribunal, all evidence of the establishment of the mortgage and the evidence of urging performance of the debt shall be transferred to the court for immediate review. However, after the establishment of the Land Tribunal, it shall be reviewed by the Land Tribunal. The aforementioned appeal shall not suspend the implementation, but in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of these Measures, the mortgagee shall be ordered to provide a guarantee of a considerable amount. Article 5: If there are special circumstances and it is necessary to order the mortgagee to provide a guarantee, with the approval of the Director of the Land Bureau, the mortgagee shall be ordered to provide a considerable guarantee as a condition for implementing the auction. The aforementioned guarantee may be provided in the form of a reputable store, valuable securities, or cash. However, if a store guarantee is used, a balance sheet of assets and liabilities that has been certified by an accountant and the Chamber of Commerce shall be submitted to the Land Bureau for filing along with the guarantee. Article 6: For land auctioned in accordance with these Measures, the purchaser shall go to the Land Bureau with the mortgagee and apply for transfer in accordance with Article 6 of the Real Estate Mortgage Registration Rules, and the mortgage registration shall be cancelled. However, the transfer of perpetual lease land shall be handled in accordance with the established regulations. Article 7: For land where mortgage rights have been established, if there are other disputes besides disagreement with the implementation of the auction, the litigation procedure shall be handled in accordance with the provisions of Article 4, paragraph 1 of these Measures. Article 8: If the mortgagee loses the lawsuit after the litigation procedure in Article 4 of these Measures is finalized, and the other party has suffered losses, the guarantee or valuable securities provided in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 and Article 5 of these Measures shall be used to compensate for the losses. However, if the guarantee is provided by a store, the store shall be jointly and severally liable for compensation. Article 9: These Measures shall be implemented upon approval by the National Government.</p>

Those in attendance included Xu and Wang, the university's deans, presidents, academic deans, and law professors, as well as several Annam overseas Chinese students from the university, including Chen Yuwen, Wei Chunfeng, and Chen Chuanxue. The university president delivered a speech first, stating that he hoped Consul-General Xu would strive to promote the friendly relations between the two countries, relieve the suffering of overseas Chinese, and introduce overseas Chinese youth to return to China for further studies within the scope of his ability after arriving in Annam. Dean Shan Cai then delivered a speech in French, with many words of encouragement, which was extremely moving. Finally, Mr. Xu replied, stating that he was willing to accept the encouragement of everyone and would do his best to enhance the friendship between China and France in Annam and to improve the political, economic, and educational status of overseas Chinese in the region. The guests and hosts enjoyed the tea party for a long time before dispersing happily.</p>

<p>The Zhejiang Public Association held its first board meeting at its clubhouse on Avenue Edward VII at 6 pm last night. More than 40 people attended. Chu Huiseng was publicly elected as chairman. After the chairman reported on the association's affairs, the agenda was discussed and the Ministry of Industry was recommended to establish a fisheries school. The details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Resolved Cases</p>
<p>(1) Improving tobacco leaves: It was resolved that the association should prepare funds to purchase seeds from the United States and distribute them to tobacco-producing areas in the province for trial planting. Dai Gengxin, Wu Wenyuan, Hua Zhenxin, Hu Yangqian, Wu Guochang, Pan Zhijiang, and Yu Hualong were publicly elected as members of the committee for improving domestic tobacco leaves. (2) Omitted. (3) It was resolved to recommend that the government dredge the Cao'e River as soon as possible. (4) (5) The chairman committee was designated as Chu Huiseng, Wang Ji, and Yin Zhufu.

(6) It was resolved to submit a request to recommend that the Ministry of Industry prepare for the establishment of a national vocational school for aquatic products, and to restore the Zhejiang Dinghai Fisheries School, and to establish branch schools in coastal provinces.</p>
<p>Original Recommendation</p>
<p>Respectfully, our association, in order to revitalize fisheries education, resolved at a general meeting of members to recommend that the Ministry of Industry prepare for the establishment of a national vocational school for aquatic products, and to restore the Zhejiang Dinghai Fisheries School, and to establish branch schools in coastal provinces. A telegram was sent to the Ministry of Industry, stating, "It is found that all countries in the East and West are actively expanding the development of aquatic education. For example, the Netherlands, a small country, has as many as 30 fisheries schools. Japan's fisheries education is almost all over the country, in order to expand its inherent production and develop its future treasures. Our country's territorial waters are vast, from the Bohai Sea to the South China Sea, and the coastline stretches for tens of thousands of miles. Aquatic tribes thrive, and shellfish scales can be taken endlessly. If there are large-scale academic groups to conduct research and practice on new fishing methods and swimming techniques, as well as the driving of wheeled ships, so that fishermen can have sufficient knowledge and skills, the progress of our country's fisheries will be unlimited. However, due to the weakness of fishermen's abilities and the immaturity of their level, they stick to old habits and do not think about progress. There is also no strong unity and novel fishing nets, so they cannot cross the ocean and only carry out old-fashioned fishing in the near sea, which makes foreign fishing boats frequently appear in Chinese waters, fishing across borders. The fish delicacies popular on the market, such as shark fins, sea cucumbers, squid, abalone, scallops, etc., and second-class products such as salmon, etc., mostly come from imported products. The loss of maritime power and the outflow of loopholes are regrettable. Moreover, our country's sea surface is vast, with lurking bandits and latent threats. Fishermen are afraid of traveling far overseas. Often, after sailing hundreds of miles, they do not see a neighboring ship passing or docking. The vast sea is deserted. Pirates are rampant and tourists are increasingly frightened. Therefore, if we want to ensure maritime safety, we must first seek the progress of fisheries. At a distance of ten or twenty miles from the sea or on the side of uninhabited barren islands, there must be a number of fishing boats gathered in it, so that pirates will be afraid and change their careers. Therefore, the development of fisheries is not only about developing profit sources, but also about consolidating the sea. The only way to develop fisheries is to promote aquatic education. Our country's aquatic education only has the Jiangsu Chongming Fisheries School. The Zhejiang Dinghai Fisheries School was established in the fifth year of the Republic of China and was closed last autumn due to disputes over changes in leadership. Guangdong is still in the process of preparation. With the vast territory of our country's territorial waters and millions of fishermen along the coast, there is only one fisheries school in the country, which is not enough to meet the needs of researching aquatic education, and to revitalize domestic industry and open up solid profit sources. The Ministry of Industry has recently set up a fishing market in Shanghai with a large amount of money, which is in line with the purpose. It is proposed to consider that fisheries are an important production industry in the coastal area, and a special amount of money should be allocated to prepare for the establishment of a national vocational school for aquatic products. The address should be set in the disputed Shengsi Islands on the border between Jiangsu and Zhejiang, where fishermen gather. On the one hand, the Zhejiang Dinghai Fisheries School should be restored, and branch schools should be established in coastal provinces. The original schools in Jiangsu and Zhejiang should also be renamed branch schools in order to unify and assign special responsibilities. This matter concerns the training of national fisheries talents and has been fully approved by the general meeting of members of our association. For this reason, a telegram is sent, requesting that the Ministry carefully review and select it for implementation," and decided to send letters to the county party headquarters and various legal entities to unanimously advocate for it. A corresponding letter is sent to your party headquarters for your reference and to inform the various legal entities in your county, hoping that you will give it your sympathy and assistance.</p>

<h3 id="e87">Silver Shops Allowed by the Government to Purchase Grade A Silver Bars for Raw Materials <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>National Conference Suspended</p>
<p>The National News Agency reporter met Mr. Fu Shengmao, chairman of the Silver Shops Association, yesterday and asked about the industry's request for the government to interpret the use of silver for raw materials. According to him, he visited a responsible person from a government agency for this issue. According to his informal statement, the government will facilitate the raw material problem of silver shops and allow the purchase of Grade A silver bars for melting to make utensils. Because there are two types of silver bars, Grade A and Grade B. Grade A silver bars, also known as 39 silver bars, mean that each hundred taels contains 99 taels and 9 qian of pure silver. Grade B silver bars, also known as 88 silver bars, mean that each hundred taels contains 88 taels of silver. In addition to making silver coins, the country specially made this kind of 39 silver bars for the purpose of making utensils. In the future, this kind of silver bars can be purchased from the Central Bank. As for customers, if they exchange old jewelry, they can also be accepted because their color is still 39, so it does not violate the government's policy of silver nationalization. Therefore, our industry is still operating as usual. The national conference that was originally planned to be convened has also been suspended.</p>

<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to all businesses in the city yesterday to donate cotton clothing to save disaster victims. The original text reads, "Respectfully, according to a letter from the 38th branch of the 7th district, it is briefly stated that this year's Yangtze River basin has been flooded, and now it is late autumn and early winter, and the weather is gradually getting cold. The suffering of the disaster victims due to hunger and cold is self-evident. In view of this, the association hereby notifies its members and orders each family to donate a certain number of old cotton clothes, so that they can be combined into a number and sent to the Shanghai Charity Relief Association for distribution to the disaster victims. However, the disaster area is vast, and the area of the association is very small, which may be a drop in the bucket and will not help. Therefore, it is specially requested to notify the branches in each district to unanimously advocate for it. The above is hereby approved. After reviewing the items stated by the association, they are indeed insightful. This matter concerns good deeds, and it is requested that all store members be notified to enthusiastically donate and send the donated cotton clothing to the Shanghai Charity Relief Association for distribution to the disaster area in order to save the disaster victims. This is of utmost importance."</p>

If all the ladies and gentlemen in the society donate their discarded old clothes, cotton quilts, etc. to the disaster area, then there will be boundless blessings. The ancient saying of clothing and benefiting the people should be moved to praise the great benefactors.</p>

<h3 id="e95">Municipal Federation Suggests to the Municipal Council <a href="#e95" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c95" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">95</a></h3>
<p>Four Methods to Solve the Telephone Price Increase Problem</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation sent a letter to the Municipal Council yesterday regarding the telephone price increase, proposing four solutions. The original text reads, "Respectfully, since the Shanghai Telephone Company, in the face of the sluggish market situation, recklessly hoped to satisfy its desire for an annual interest rate of one point, and issued a ridiculous move to demand a price increase, public opinion unanimously expressed opposition. Fortunately, your bureau took into account the difficulties of the times and the burden on users, so it specially invited experts to review it and solemnly handled the matter. We are very grateful. Unexpectedly, the expert research results favored one side. In its report, it even recognized the company's request for an annual interest rate of one point as correct, and offered advice to charge by the number of calls as a disguised price increase, while completely ignoring the company's wasteful expenses, the wrong interest rate, and whether users can afford it. All circles have expressed indignation at this. We believe that the telephone is a public utility and a communication tool, and should strive to be common, with low fees and many installations as the principle. Even if the company is concerned about business, it should also profit from the increase, otherwise, the more the telephone fee increases, the fewer users there will be, and as a result, the company will inevitably fail. Now, in the expert report, the regulations on the charging by the number of calls are: 10 yuan per month for stores, which can make 150 calls, and 6 yuan and 5 jiao per month for households, which can make 100 calls. For any number exceeding the above, a fee of 3 cents will be charged for each call. From the surface, the monthly rent seems to be slightly lower than before, but due to the strict restrictions on the number of calls and the high fees for exceeding the number, the burden on users has actually increased significantly. Therefore, if the expert's opinion is implemented rashly, users will be forced to remove them due to the heavy telephone fees, and the company will not only not be able to achieve its extravagant hope of an annual interest rate of one point, but will also be in a more difficult situation. It can be boldly asserted that our association will also conduct careful discussions, believing that even if the charging by the number of calls method is to be implemented, it should be amended as follows: (1) The monthly rent should be reduced to 6 yuan for stores and 3 yuan for households. (2) The basic number of calls should be increased to 300 per month for stores and 200 for residences. (3) A fee of 2 cents should be charged for each call exceeding the number. (4) The call fee between the urban area and the special area should be cancelled. In this way, fairness can be seen, and there will be fewer obstacles in the implementation of the charging by the number of calls method. On the one hand, due to the reduction in telephone fees, it will inevitably attract an increase in users. This will definitely promote the development of the company's business. The special zone telephone problem will be the final decision of your bureau, so we are submitting our opinions for your adoption, which will benefit both users and the company."</p>
<h3 id="e96">Hong Kong National Bank Shanghai Branch Creditors' Committee Bankruptcy Petition Rejected <a href="#e96" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c96" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">96</a></h3>
<p>And Ordered to Bear Litigation Costs</p>
<p>Lawyer Liang Yaobing, formerly in the name of the Hong Kong National Bank Shanghai Branch Creditors' Committee, filed a case with the First Special District Court to declare the branch bankrupt. The court rejected the case and ordered the committee to bear the litigation costs. The reasons for the ruling are recorded as follows: Bankruptcy is declared when a debtor is unable to pay off their debts. Furthermore, if a debtor ceases payment, it is presumed that they are unable to pay, as clearly stipulated in Articles 50 and 1, Paragraph 2 of the Bankruptcy Law. However, the so-called cessation of payment in Article 1, Paragraph 2 of the law, which presumes inability to pay, allows the debtor to legally present evidence to refute this presumption. In this case, the petitioner, entrusted by the creditors, petitioned for a declaration of bankruptcy on behalf of creditors with common interests. Although the lawsuit is not inherently illegal, the reason for the bankruptcy petition is solely that the debtor announced a business closure on September 16th of this year, ceasing payments. According to Article 1, Paragraph 1 of the Bankruptcy Law, this should be presumed as an inability to pay. Therefore, according to the provisions of Articles 57 and 58, Paragraph 1 of the same law, the petitioner requested a declaration of bankruptcy for the debtor. The petition is based entirely on the presumed fact of inability to pay. However, the debtor has presented an audit report from accountant Wang Zikang, proving that the debtor's assets are sufficient to cover its debts with a surplus. Furthermore, the newspaper clipping submitted by the petitioner (Exhibit 1) also contains a statement from their representative lawyer, Liang Yaobing, to reporters, stating that the situation of the National Bank in Shanghai is relatively good, and its assets exceed its liabilities. This is sufficient evidence that the debtor's assets are indeed sufficient to pay off its debts. The petitioner's sudden petition for a declaration of bankruptcy is not legally sound and should be rejected. In accordance with Article 5 of the Bankruptcy Law and Articles 95 and 78 of the Code of Civil Procedure, the ruling is as stated in the main text.</p>

<p>Li Wenbin's Business Failure: How Does the Landlord Feel About This?</p>
<p>Li Wenbin, a native of Wuxi (45 years old), residing at No. 9, Lane 46, Meijia Lane in this city, formerly ran a copper workshop. Recently, due to business failure, he ceased operations, and his life fell into dire straits. Recently, his landlord, Shen Xie Jia, filed a lawsuit in the local court, requesting the recovery of rent arrears and the eviction of the tenant. The court ruled that Li Wenbin should pay 196 yuan in rent arrears and vacate the premises within a specified period. Li expressed his willingness to vacate, but requested that the landlord allow him to pay the rent arrears in installments, which the landlord refused. Li, in a moment of desperation, conceived a suicidal idea. He secretly swallowed nitric acid the night before. When the poison took effect and he began to moan, his family discovered him and immediately sent him to Baolong Hospital for treatment, but it was ineffective, and he died. The hospital sent the body to the coroner's office. Yesterday, after the court confirmed the cause of death, the family retrieved the body and placed it in a coffin at home.</p>
<h3 id="e98">Another Thief Sentenced to Five Years in the Shanghai Bank Embezzlement Case <a href="#e98" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c98" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">98</a></h3>
<p>Shen Abing Pleads Innocence and Appeals</p>
<p>On the morning of November 21st of last year, the Yuyuan Road branch of the Shanghai Bank sent staff members in a private car to deliver 5,210 yuan in cash to the Jiaotong University Savings Office for their use. When the car reached Haige Road, it was blocked by a gang of thieves carrying straw on their shoulders. They robbed all the cash. Since the incident occurred within the jurisdiction of the French Concession Police, detectives and Inspector Jin Jiulin, along with Detective Zhou Bu, successively arrested eight thieves, including Zhang Zilong and Zhu Xueneng (who was released from the Jiaotong University store by him). Not much of the stolen money was recovered. They were sent to the Second Special Court, interrogated, and sentenced to imprisonment, and the sentences have been finalized and they have been sent to prison. At that time, Zhang and the other thieves confessed that Shen Bingsheng, aka Shen Abing, also known as "Blind Abing," a native of Pudong residing at No. 120 Yangjing Town, was also a major perpetrator in the case. When the detectives went to arrest Shen, he had already gotten wind of it and fled, escaping justice. He was then sent to the Songhu Garrison Headquarters for interrogation and sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment. The case was discovered by detectives from the French Concession Police who were investigating theft and security, who reported it to the Chief of Police and requested the Second Special Court to send an official document on the 3rd of last month to the Garrison Headquarters, transferring Shen into their custody. He was sent to the Second Special Court, where the lawyer from the Police Department filed a public prosecution on charges of robbery and receiving stolen goods. Judge Wang Gangxu, the head of the Criminal Division, opened the court for interrogation, and Zhang Zilong and others involved in the case were brought to the court for questioning. The details have already been recorded in this newspaper. The case has now been concluded. Yesterday, Judge Wang came to the Second Criminal Court and ordered Shen Abing to be brought to the court. Shen Abing was sentenced to five years of imprisonment for instigating, carrying weapons, and committing robbery in a gang. The accused pleaded innocent upon hearing the verdict and immediately requested an appeal in court. The court granted the appeal and ordered him to be detained in the detention center during the appeal period.</p>
<h3 id="e99">Gold Trade Association Public Welfare Donation Dispute Case <a href="#e99" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c99" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">99</a></h3>
<p>One Side Relies on the Resolution Record</p>
<p>The Other Side Attacks Because It Was Not Approved</p>
<p>Xu Busun, Chairman of the Gold Trade Association, and Standing Committee Members Cai Jiusheng and Zhao Zhongying, are being sued for fraud in the First Special District Court by Hong Yujin, the manager of Broker No. 165 of the Gold Exchange, and supervisor Sha Zhaochang. They allege that the 20 yuan public welfare donation collected by the Association was in accordance with trade regulations, but these regulations have not been approved by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau. The First Special Court had previously summoned the parties for questioning, as reported in this newspaper on the first of the month. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Huang Risheng continued the hearing in the Fifth Criminal Court. The defendants, Xu Busun, Cai Jiusheng, Zhao Zhongying, and others, stated that the Gold Trade Association, originally named the Gold Trade Guild, was founded during the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty. They have been appointed as directors since the Xuantong era and have served for as long as 20 years. Last January, it was reorganized into the Gold Trade Association, and they were reappointed to their current positions. The public welfare donation was only collected once when they first took office as managers, initially called a bulk donation, and was collected based on a resolution passed by the trade in the Guihai year. It was used to operate the Yulun Association, which specializes in providing relief to orphans and widows in the trade and distributing rice and medicine. There are annual account books that are distributed to members, etc. They then submitted the account books, resolution records, and other documents to the court. Sha Zhaochang then claimed, according to the defendants' statements, that they have been in office since the Xuantong era. Are there no talented people in the gold trade? It is evident that the defendants are manipulating and controlling things. Furthermore, my lawsuit is entirely because they are using unapproved trade regulations to defraud others of money. The court, seeing that the facts were clear, ordered the start of the debate. The plaintiff's representative lawyer, Li Mo, and the defendants' defense lawyers, Qin Liankui and Lu Jun, debated each other. Judge Huang then announced the end of the debate and scheduled the judgment to be announced on the 16th.</p>

<p>Wang Youlin Jumps from Building, Causing Tragedy</p>
<p>The Shengrui Varnish Factory at No. 241 Shide Lane, Maigen Road, Maite Hesituo Road, was opened by Wang Youlin (52 years old), a native of Tianjin. Wang's wife, Chen (43 years old), lives in the factory. Yesterday afternoon, at around 3:00 PM, a fire suddenly broke out in the factory. Because varnish is extremely flammable, sparks flew everywhere in an instant, affecting the entire house and piercing through the roof. At the time, Wang and his wife were upstairs. Because the ladder had been burned through, and the room was full of fire, there was nowhere to escape. They hurriedly pushed open the upstairs window, and both jumped from the window. Unexpectedly, due to old age and weakness, they could not support themselves and fell to the ground, causing Wang Youlin to injure his head and suffer burns in many places on his body. His breath was faint, and he was on the verge of death. Wang Chen also suffered burns all over her body. There was also an employee, Shen Liwen, a native of Chongming, 23 years old, who was slightly injured when he went into the fire to retrieve account books. Fortunately, the fire brigade had received a report at this time and rushed to the scene, and the fire was extinguished with great effort. However, neighboring houses had been affected. An ambulance was immediately used to send the injured to the hospital. Wang Youlin eventually died of his injuries at 5:30 PM. The police were notified, and the body was transferred to the coroner's office for examination while investigating the cause of the fire to serve as a basis for handling the matter.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Notorious Pickpocket Sentenced <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>Enticing a Young Girl for Attempted Rape Revealed the Crime: Hu Asheng, Xu Decai, and Others Suffer Punishment</p>
<p>Xu Decai, a native of Qingjiang, known as "Big Head Xu," a master pickpocket in Shanghai, and Hu Asheng, a native of Ningbo, had many accomplices under their command. They specialized in performing their sleight-of-hand skills in streetcars, movie theaters, and other places in the British, French, and Chinese sections, and had never been caught. In this line of work, the jargon is called "hard pickpocketing," also known as "running a dying business." This time, however, they were destined to be caught. The reason is that on the afternoon of the 14th of last month, Hu Asheng lured a fellow villager, Wang Xiaocai (16 years old), to Room 342 of the Dafang Hotel on Zhengjia Wood Bridge, intending to rape her. After the girl managed to escape, Hu, feeling resentful for having wasted the room money, reported to the French Police, claiming that Wang Xiaocai had swindled him out of five yuan in prostitution money and stolen thirty yuan in foreign currency before fleeing. The police chief approved the report and sent detectives to investigate. After questioning Wang, they learned that Hu had made a false accusation out of spite. After a thorough investigation by Detective Lu Zhulin and Detective Zhu Zhihao, they discovered that Hu and Xu were notorious pickpockets. They arrested Hu and also arrested Xu and his accomplices Wang Dehua, Yuan Hailin, etc., and sent them to the Second Special Court for interrogation and investigation. The details have already been reported. Subsequently, the police discovered that Hu, Xu, and others had committed hundreds of theft cases in the concession, but very few victims had been notified to come to court. The reason is that it was impossible to notify most of them. The case was prosecuted by the Police Department in accordance with the law. Judge Wang Gangxu, the head of the Criminal Division of the Second Special Court, repeatedly opened court sessions to hear and examine the case and declared the debate concluded. He found that Yuan Hailin had engaged in receiving and selling stolen goods, and ordered him to post bail and await sentencing. Yesterday was the date of sentencing. In the afternoon, Judge Wang came to the Second Criminal Court and ordered the defendants to be brought to the court. Hu Asheng was sentenced to three years of imprisonment for jointly committing continuous theft. Xu Decai (same charge) was sentenced to two years and six months of imprisonment. Yuan Hailin was fined 60 yuan; if he chose to perform labor in lieu of payment, it would be calculated at one yuan per day. Wang Dehua was found not guilty. During the appeal period, Hu and Xu were ordered to be detained in the detention center, Yuan was released on his original bail, and Wang was released on 500 yuan bail guaranteeing his availability for questioning at any time; if he could not provide bail, he would be detained.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Silk Trade Association, Qianjiang Guild Hall, Crepe Trade Association, Shengjing Guild Hall, and other silk trade organizations convened an emergency meeting of all member firms at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss the issue of silk prices. Since the government implemented the legal tender system, material prices have soared. Raw silk was only about 350 yuan per load in early autumn, and has gradually increased to nearly 900 yuan. Furthermore, foreign firms are aggressively buying up silk, resulting in a shortage of fine silk supply, which has greatly increased costs. To maintain production costs, it is necessary to discuss solutions. The meeting resulted in a decision to notify all firms that, effective immediately, all pure silk woven goods will have a temporary price increase of 5% and rayon-silk woven goods will have a temporary price increase of 3% to maintain costs. The discussion continued until evening before adjourning.</p>

<p>The Shanghai County West of Huangpu River telephone plan had already been drafted by the former Construction Bureau, but it has been delayed until now due to financial difficulties. Although the Shanghai-Minhang line from Shanghai to Minhang has been installed and is in operation by the Shanghai Telephone Bureau, the branch lines in various townships are still lacking, which is very inconvenient for communication. The County Government has now submitted the budget for the Shanghai County West of Huangpu River telephone plan, and it has been approved. The plan includes four lines: Bei Yu (Beiqiao to Yutang), Bei Hui (Beiqiao via Maqiao to Huiqiao), Bei Cao (Beiqiao via Tangwan to Caohang), and Bei Guan (Beiqiao to Guangang Qianliangmiao). A 20-line switchboard will be installed in Beiqiao, and a telephone will be installed in Yutang, Beiqiao, Huiqiao, Maqiao, Tangwan, Caohang, Guangang Qianliangmiao, and various county party and government agencies. Contractors are currently being sought, and the installation will begin soon. It is expected that telephone service will be available by the end of the lunar year.</p>

<p>Built by the Shanghai Industrial Trust Company</p>
<p>Zhabei Road is becoming increasingly populated, and the market is also becoming more prosperous. There used to be a vegetable market at the intersection of Xibaoxing Road and Yanjiage Road, but it was destroyed by artillery fire during the January 28th Incident. The Shanghai Industrial Trust Company recently rebuilt a two-story reinforced concrete vegetable market on the original site, in view of the many floating stalls lining the roadside, which were inconvenient for both buyers and sellers. This market is sufficient to accommodate the existing floating stalls and more. It has now been completed and is scheduled to open for business on January 1st. From then on, residents in the area will find it more convenient to buy vegetables, and it will also benefit traffic and the appearance of the city.</p>

<p>There has been no dedicated ship service between Shanghai and Shatou, an inland river transport hub, which has been very inconvenient. It is reported that Qiao Lie and many others, in order to develop inland river transportation, have raised capital to establish the Shensha Shipping Bureau. The Bureau's office is currently located at No. 6 Baodeli, West End of Bentang Lane, Beijing Road in this port. On odd-numbered days, the ship departs from Shanghai in the afternoon, passing through Kunshan, Taicang, Shuangfeng, Zhitang, and Shatou. From these ports, it connects to Hejiashi, Sanjiashi, Penglaishi, Yuewushi, Huchuanqiao, Guizhuang, Zhitang, Fuqiao, Hengjing, Liuhua, and other ports.

<p>Regarding the payment of rickshaw rental by public rickshaw pullers, the Rickshaw Affairs Committee has issued a notice and posted it at rickshaw inspection stations, license registration offices, and various branches of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, advising rickshaw pullers to pay in large dollars to avoid exploitation and loss by rickshaw owners. The Rickshaw Affairs Committee has previously posted a notice, displayed at rickshaw inspection, licensing, and mutual aid offices, that all payments should be made in big dollars in order to avoid exploitation and loss. The rickshaw rental fee (including the mutual aid fee) has long been stipulated by the Municipal Council. The maximum rate is 85 cents per day. Traditionally, there are two shifts, morning and evening, which vary in length. If the morning and evening shifts are of equal length, then the rental fee will also be the same, with a maximum of 42.5 cents per shift. According to current market prices, this amount is equivalent to 50 cents in small dollars and three copper coins, or two dimes and 28 copper coins. It is hoped that all rickshaw pullers will be informed and calculate accordingly.</p>

<p>Accountants Ordered to Investigate Accounts; No Encroachment or Other Misconduct Found</p>
<p>Sheng Yuzhen, Sun Hezhai, Zhao Ziyu, and others, former general manager, deputy manager, and accountants of the Three-New Cotton Mill, were sued by 317 employees, including Peng Zhaoli, and eight others, including Hou Jiahai and Liu Jinchen, in the First Special District Court after the mill was sold in 1932. The plaintiffs alleged embezzlement and breach of trust. Because the plaintiffs requested an audit of the accounts, the court suspended the criminal proceedings and transferred the case to the Civil Division for trial. Now that the civil disputes have been resolved, the Criminal Division resumed the hearing. It was opened last Saturday, but because all the plaintiffs failed to appear, it was adjourned to yesterday afternoon. Judge Xiao Xie-Fen summoned the parties. Only one plaintiff, Hou Jiahai, appeared. Judge Xiao instructed them that the civil suits they had previously filed were all requests to audit the accounts of the Tongshantang property. The Civil Division has already selected an accountant to audit the accounts in the case filed by Peng Zhaoli and others, and no embezzlement or other misconduct was found. What further claims do you have now? Hou replied that many of the plaintiffs in this case have not arrived, and I personally cannot make any claims. I request a postponement to notify the other plaintiffs and discuss everything. The court stated that the case had been delayed for three years, and this hearing had already been notified twice. Since the plaintiffs still failed to appear, there was no need to postpone it any further. The court then questioned the three defendants, Sheng, Sun, and Zhao, and the defendants' lawyers made their arguments. The court then ordered both parties to wait for the verdict on the afternoon of the 16th of this month.</p>

<p>According to the Central News Agency, since its establishment, the Central Film Studio in Nanjing, under the leadership of Studio Director Zhang Chong, has made extraordinary efforts in the production of news films. During the Sixth National Games held in the city center last month, the studio sent multiple cameramen to Shanghai to shoot a sound film. Everything from the opening ceremony, Tai Chi exercises, various track and field events, swimming, various ball game finals, martial arts, wrestling, and even the closing ceremony was captured on film, making it the most complete record of the National Games. What is most commendable is that more than 30 champion athletes were recruited to speak in front of the microphone and were filmed into a sound film. The most beautiful and eye-catching figures were the mermaid Yang Xiuqiong, the football king Li Huitang, the sprint prodigy Liu Changchun, and Miss Shanghai Li Sen. There were also songs by Mongolian athletes and other slow-motion photography, which were all quite interesting. The film has now been scheduled by the Central Film Studio and will be screened at the Lido Theatre on Beijing Road starting today. At the same time, a film of the opening ceremony of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang will also be screened, which records the opening situation in great detail.

<h3 id="e115">Industrial Expert Huang Xiancheng Invents a Travel Folding Cabinet <a href="#e115" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c115" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">115</a></h3>
<p>Currently Applying to the Ministry for a Patent</p>
<p>Mr. Huang Xiancheng is from Changsha, Hunan Province. He studied at Beijing Normal University. In the ninth year of the Republic [1920], he went to France at his own expense and was admitted to the Paris Higher Industrial School. He then transferred to the Belgian National Industrial School to study machinery. He completed his studies and returned to China in the seventeenth year of the Republic [1928]. He successively served as an engineer and mechanical instructor at the Military Transportation Research Institute of the Chinese Industrial Arts School. Recently, he has used his years of knowledge to invent a type of travel folding cabinet. Last year, he applied to the Ministry of Industry for a patent. Unexpectedly, the Ministry misunderstood, thinking it was for ordinary travel use, and did not approve it. Mr. Huang personally took the structure of the cabinet, its benefits, to the Academia Sinica, requesting experimentation. The president of the academy, Cai Yuanpei, consulted with many people and confirmed it as a new invention in industry. Besides writing a letter to the Ministry of Industry to prove it for Mr. Huang, he also wrote a written introduction. The content roughly stated: “Mr. Huang Xiancheng has created the Xiancheng travel cabinet. Its structure is divided into three types, and each type can be deduced and changed into ten or a hundred types, with minor differences. The novel and exquisite cabinet is about one and a half meters high, one meter wide, and half a meter deep. It can be opened, closed, or folded at any time. Inside, there is a clothes rod for hanging Chinese and Western clothes, as well as arbitrarily spaced partitions for placing books, and a document bag for placing small items. It is truly an original creation, different from those that are imitated or modified. The design began during the January 28th Truce [1932] and went through a long period of painstaking research and repeated improvements, finally succeeding in the spring of the twenty-third year [1934]. The difficulty of the creation can be seen from this. The reason it is named a travel cabinet is because in recent times, transportation is convenient, and there are many people traveling, as well as male and female students studying far away. Whenever they arrive at a place, they always need a wardrobe. If they buy one everywhere, the cost is not small, and it is heavy and difficult to move. If they don't buy one, clothes are easily soiled, which is very inconvenient. Moreover, bookshelves cannot be dispensed with, so he created an item that serves as both a wardrobe and a bookshelf. It is sturdy, lightweight, and convenient for travel and carrying. When not traveling, it can be used as furniture, saving money and being most suitable for the middle class. In addition, it can also be decorated with brocade and embroidery, making it suitable for wealthy families. Its structure is exquisite, and when it is released to the world in the future, it will surely become very popular.” Currently, Mr. Huang has resubmitted the application to the Ministry of Industry for a patent based on the points proven by Mr. Cai, and it is expected that there will be no problems and that it will be approved soon.</p>

<p>The Shanghai Theater's five-act costume musical drama "Xi Shi" returned last month with praise from Beijing and Hangzhou. It was originally scheduled to perform at the Zhenguang Grand Theater under Gusu Terrace. However, the Central Grand Theater in this city strongly invited the theater's male and female actors to perform on stage, so it was decided to stay in Shanghai for three days, starting today. People in Shanghai have long wanted to see the Xi Shi maiden returning tired from the shores of West Lake, so yesterday afternoon, those who went to the Central to buy tickets were already very crowded.</p>

<p>(B) Microscopic Examination: (1) Peritoneum: On the peritoneal surface of the peritoneum, there are deposits of fibrinous and polymorphonuclear leukocyte exudates. The mesothelial cells on the membrane surface are necrotic and adhere to the exudates on the surface. Here, the peritoneal tissue shows polymorphonuclear leukocyte cell infiltration, blood vessel dilation, and acute inflammatory changes. (2) Intestine: The mucosa and submucosa of the small and large intestines do not show lesions. The outer layer of the muscle layer and the subserosal layer show significant polymorphonuclear cell and a small number of mononuclear wandering cell infiltration, congestion, and edema. On the peritoneal surface, there are deposits of fibrinous and leukocytic exudates. (3) Mesenteric and retroperitoneal lymph nodes: The peritoneal surface of the mesentery has a small amount of fibrin and leukocytic exudates deposited. The mesenteric lymph nodes do not show inflammatory changes. The retroperitoneal lymph nodes are hyperplastic, with an excessive number of polymorphonuclear leukocytes and mononuclear cells accumulated in them. The blood vessels are dilated. (4) Bladder: The peritoneum is normal. The subserosal layer shows slight cell infiltration, mostly small round cells and mononuclear cells. The muscle layer also shows the same type of infiltration, with the addition of polymorphonuclear cells. The outer layer of the bladder wall shows significant polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, and fibrinous exudates are also deposited on its membrane surface. (5) Prostate: The glandular follicles are mostly dilated and contain eosinophilic amorphous matter. In several places, the interstitium shows moderate small round cell, mononuclear cell, and polymorphonuclear leukocyte infiltration. (6) Kidney: Most glomeruli are normal, but a small number show fibrosis. Here, the interstitium also shows moderate or mild small round cell infiltration. The epithelial cells of the renal tubules show parenchymal degeneration, otherwise normal. In one place, a cyst is formed, with a very thin wall, and the inner membrane is covered with a single layer of flat cells. The cavity contains a small amount of eosinophilic substance. The wall of the renal pelvis is normal. (7) The outer capsule of the liver is nodular and shows polymorphonuclear leukocytes and fibrinous exudates deposited on its peritoneum. The liver substance shows multiple uneven and irregular hepatocyte masses, with a large amount of fibrous tissue interspersed. There is small round cell and mononuclear cell infiltration, and there are excessive bile capillaries. Therefore, the normal lobular structure of the liver is completely absent. In several places, multiple irregular dilated blood vessels and blood sinuses are accumulated into sheets, undoubtedly sponge-like hemangiomas. (8) Spleen: The outer membrane of the spleen also has fibrinous and leukocytic exudates. The number of lymphocytes is relatively small, but the size and cells are normal. The splenic pulp shows multiple erythrocytes and excessive polymorphonuclear leukocytes. Where congestion is not very obvious, the walls of the splenic pulp's blood vessels can be seen to be thickened. (9) Lung: The lung substance taken from the left lung shows fibrous degeneration, with calcareous caseous masses of varying sizes, around which a small number of multinucleated giant cells can be seen. The lung substance in other parts does not show lesions. (10) Stomach: The gastric mucosa is mostly normal, but in one place, there is an ulcer. This ulcer reaches the upper part of the muscle layer. The surface of the ulcer has a small amount of necrotic tissue deposited. In the tissue around the ulcer, the submucosa is the most obvious, showing moderate small round cell and mononuclear cell infiltration and increased fibrous tissue. The penis is slightly changed, and the axillary lymph nodes are not enlarged. (11) Aorta: The inner layer of the aorta shows local thickening, with increased fibrous cells and fatty substances. The middle and outer layers are normal. (12) Sphenoid sinus: The epithelium taken from the sphenoid sinus shows a normal epithelial layer. The subepithelial layer is slightly thicker than normal and has a small number of small round cells and mononuclear cells infiltrated. (13) Middle ear and other cervical spine bodies: Examination not completed. (14) Heart, gallbladder, thyroid, pituitary, pancreas, adrenal gland, thymus, testicle, and epididymis: Do not show significant lesions. (C) Bacteriological Report: According to the bacteriological report, hemolytic streptococci were detected by culture from abdominal fluid, pericardial fluid, urine, pus around the ureter, and heart blood. Escherichia coli was detected from abdominal fluid, urine, pus around the ureter, and pericardial fluid. Bile did not grow anything. (D) Parasitological Report: According to the parasitological report, stool was brown-red, with leukocytes 10, erythrocytes 10, mucus 10, and no parasites or eggs detected. (E) Diagnosis: Hemolytic streptococcal sepsis, complete acute membrane inflammation (hemolytic streptococcus), acute retroperitoneal cellulitis (hemolytic streptococcus), acute periureteritis (hemolytic streptococcus), acute retroperitoneal lymphadenitis, acute splenomegaly, parenchymal degeneration of internal organs, subacute cystitis (hemolytic streptococcus), subacute prostatitis, chronic sphenoid sinusitis, Ma's laceration of the abdominal wall, lack of appendix, mild ulcerative colitis, nodular cirrhosis, splenomegaly, chronic gastric ulcer, local chronic nephritis, chronic pulmonary tuberculosis, local pleural adhesions in the upper left, mild aortic sclerosis, cavernous hemangioma of the liver, congenital renal cyst, congenital phimosis on the right, congenital duodenal malformation.</p>
<p>(F) Surgical Pathology Report</p>
<p>(No. 3991) (A) Gross Examination: The examination material is an appendix, 4 cm long and 0.6 cm in diameter. Its outer membrane is smooth and shiny, but in several places, there are thin layers of yellow fibrinous exudates deposited. The blood vessels of the outer membrane are congested and tortuous. When cut open, the cut surface does not show obvious lesions. (B) Microscopic Examination: The appendix lumen does not contain exudates. The mucosa and submucosa are normal, but in the latter layer, there are several places with brown pigment deposits. The muscle layer has no lesions. The outer layer is edematous, the blood vessels are dilated, and there is moderate polymorphonuclear leukocyte and mononuclear cell infiltration. The outer membrane surface has a small amount of fibrinous and leukocytic exudates covering it. (C) Diagnosis: Acute periappendicitis. (G) Conclusion</p>
<p>According to the above sections, the cause of death was hemolytic streptococcal sepsis and complete acute peritonitis. The cause of the disease may have originated from sphenoid sinusitis. The patient must have had symptoms of hemolytic streptococcal influenza in the early stages. Later, the bacteria reached the sphenoid sinus from the nose, first causing acute sphenoid sinusitis, and then gradually turning into chronic sphenoid sinusitis. If the patient's resistance is strong, there will be no other complications. Otherwise, the bacteria will spread to other places, and other concurrent or secondary diseases will occur. In Ge's case, it may be because of overwork or fatigue on the road, leading to reduced resistance. Therefore, bacteria from the sphenoid sinus spread to the bladder, causing cystitis. The tissue around the bladder should have lymphatics, which are connected to the lymphatics of the retroperitoneal tissue. Therefore, the spread of cystitis outward can reach the retroperitoneal part, leading to acute retroperitoneal cellulitis. The accumulation of pus around the ureter that we found is also a manifestation of this disease. The pus accumulation area outside the right ureter is very close to the appendix, so it is clear that the symptoms of appendicitis can occur. The result of the appendix examination is a manifestation of complete acute peritonitis. The infection of the peritoneum can come from the retroperitoneal tissue or from blood transmission. In short, Ge's cause of death was various diseases caused by highly toxic hemolytic streptococcus. The most important of these were sepsis and complete acute peritonitis. Other symptoms such as pulmonary tuberculosis, cirrhosis, and gastric ulcer cannot be fatal.

<h3 id="e125">Methods for Raising Funds for Compulsory Education in Provinces, Cities, and Counties <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Jointly drafted by the Ministries of Education and Finance, approved by the Executive Yuan for implementation</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education recently, together with the Ministry of Finance, drafted an outline of temporary measures for provinces, cities, and counties to raise funds for compulsory education. It was submitted to the Executive Yuan for review and approval and has now been approved and filed by the Executive Yuan. The Yuan has issued a circular to the provincial and municipal governments for implementation. The original text of the Executive Yuan's circular and the said measures are recorded below:</p>
<p>The Executive Yuan instructed the provincial and municipal governments, stating in brief: "Regarding the joint submission by the Ministries of Finance and Education on October 23 of this year, 'Regarding the joint telegraphic request submitted by the Director of the Education Department of Hunan Province and twenty-three directors of education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities such as Zhejiang and Shanghai to the Ministry of Education, requesting that it be forwarded to the Executive Yuan to issue a circular to the provincial and municipal governments, ordering the counties and cities to comply. The plans proposed by the education departments and bureaus of various provinces and cities stipulate that the compulsory education expenses that should be paid by the counties and cities each year should be allocated by the counties and cities as much as possible. The finance departments and bureaus of the provinces and cities should be instructed to do their best to plan for increasing education funds and should not use the excuse of exorbitant taxes and miscellaneous levies to obstruct them.' After investigation by our departments, China has a vast territory, and there are many children who are out of school. It is indeed impossible for the expenses of compulsory education to be entirely covered by the national treasury or the treasuries of the provinces and cities. However, there should be special regulations and measures from the central government for the local governments to raise compulsory education funds on their own to serve as standards and avoid disputes. Now, our departments, based on Article 6 of the Outline of Temporary Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education, 'The principle of compulsory education funding is that the local governments are responsible for it,' and Article 25 of the Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Outline of Temporary Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education, 'The compulsory education funds for a county or city should be allocated according to the local situation, or designated school properties, or designated special tax revenues, and the people may be encouraged to make donations to the best of their ability,' and with reference to the Financial Revenue and Expenditure System Law, have jointly drafted Temporary Measures for Provinces, Counties, and Cities to Raise Funds for Compulsory Education, so that there is something to follow when raising funds for compulsory education in various places. Whether this is appropriate or not, we have compiled these measures and attached a copy of the original telegraphic request to be submitted to your Yuan for review and filing, and we request that these temporary measures be circulated to the provincial and municipal governments for compliance.'"</p>
<p>Outline of Temporary Measures for Provinces, Counties, and Cities to Raise Funds for Compulsory Education</p>
<p>(1) This outline of measures is formulated based on Article 6 of the Outline of Temporary Measures for the Implementation of Compulsory Education and the provisions of Chapter 6 of the Detailed Rules for Implementation.</p>
<p>(2) The compulsory education funds in each elementary school district in each province, county, and city should be determined based on the number of schools established and the amount of funds needed. As a principle, more than half of the funds should be raised locally by each county and city.</p>
<p>(3) The compulsory education funds in each elementary school district in each province, county, and city should be verified and included in the county and city budgets by the county and city education administrative agencies. If there are increases after the budget is announced, they should be supplemented according to the procedures for supplementary budgets and be subject to the management and supervision of the local financial agencies.</p>
<p>(4) The revenue and expenditure of compulsory education funds in each elementary school district in each province, county, and city must be absolutely open and should be announced in the elementary school district at the end of each semester so that everyone knows.</p>
<p>(5) Provinces, counties, and cities should raise funds for compulsory education within the following scope: 1. Income from school properties designated by the provincial government upon approval by the county or city government. 2. Income from legal taxes and surtaxes designated by the provincial government upon approval by the county or city government. 3. Income from the reorganization of existing school properties in the counties, cities, townships, or school districts by the county or city government, resulting in increased revenue. 4. Voluntary donations to compulsory education funds by benevolent individuals. 5. Donations shared by the people in counties, cities, or townships through voluntary public consultation and approved according to law.</p>
<p>(6) The income from newly added compulsory education funds in the provinces, counties, cities, and townships, whose source is of a county-wide or city-wide nature, should be planned and allocated on a county-wide or city-wide basis. Those belonging to a township or a school district should be used for that township or school district immediately.</p>
<p>(7) The measures for raising compulsory education funds in municipalities directly under the Executive Yuan shall apply mutatis mutandis to the provisions of this outline regarding provinces or cities.</p>
<p>(8) These measures shall be submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and implementation.</p>

<p>Reception by Various Circles</p>
<p>More than twenty organizations in the city, including the Municipal Party Headquarters, the Municipal Government, the Social Affairs Bureau, the Education Bureau, the Social Education Society, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Municipal Farmers' Association, the Shanghai Branch of the Cultural Construction Association, the Shanghai Branch of the Educational Film Association, the Municipal Education Association, the Aviation Association, the China Flying Society, the Air Defense Association, the Northwest Problems Research Association, the Tongjiao Society, the Recreation Association, the Confucius Worship Society, the Chinese and Western Drugstores, the Chenbao Newspaper, the Shanghai News Agency, the Jiangyin Society, Tongminzhi, the Commercial World Bookstore, Shanghai Middle School, and the Alumni Association of the Local Autonomy Training Institute, hosted a tea party at Snow Garden yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM.

Ai Sha and Bian Hanmode, representatives of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, also attended the meeting.</p>
<p>Chairman's Speech</p>
<p>First, Chairman Shi Xingbai gave a speech, stating in brief that because Xinjiang is located on the border and transportation is difficult, the situation there is isolated from the interior. Now, seeing Xinjiang compatriots come here, the people of Shanghai are very excited. In the future, we must integrate Xinjiang with the interior. On the one hand, we must develop transportation, and on the other hand, we must communicate culture so that students from Xinjiang can come to the interior to study continuously. They should be able to recognize and train in the language, writing, customs, and habits of the interior to seek national unity and share the responsibility of saving the country. He hopes that everyone will uphold this purpose and work hard in their studies. Then, Wang Yi, a representative of the Hui people, gave a speech, which was translated and relayed by Ai Sha.</p>
<p>Ai Sha's Speech</p>
<p>Next, two Xinjiang representatives gave speeches expressing their gratitude. Then, Ai Sha, a representative of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, gave a speech, stating in brief that because Xinjiang is located in a remote area, they know nothing about the situation in the interior. However, many intellectuals in Xinjiang have new awareness. Without communicating culture with the interior, there is no way to seek the unity of the Chinese nation. Although the Communist Party and others are trying to sabotage in Xinjiang, the people of Xinjiang are not confused by them. In the future, he hopes that the central government can develop the Northwest, so that the future of the people of Xinjiang will be bright. Finally, Li Dachao of the Municipal Government gave a speech, and then they took a photo and dispersed.</p>
<p>Departing for Beijing Last Night</p>
<p>The group of twenty-one Xinjiang students, led by Ai Sha and Bian Hanmode, left Shanghai by overnight express train at 11:00 PM last night. Representatives from various organizations went to the station to see them off. After the students arrive in Beijing, they will be assigned to the Xinjiang Class of Central University, the Central Military Academy, and the Haozang School, respectively.</p>

<h3 id="e132">The Second Issue of Volume Two of Cultural Construction Monthly is Published <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>On the eve of the Sixth Plenary Session, China's political system was being hotly debated. The recently published Cultural Construction Monthly publishes several articles on policy issues. The journal hopes that these articles can guide the Chinese people to grasp the important opportunities of the moment. The first article is Sa Mengwu's "What Kind of Constitution Does China Need?" After dissecting and analyzing the political systems of various countries in the world, it puts forward the central theory that "Chinese people should sacrifice democracy for China, not sacrifice China for democracy." Other articles, such as Cheng Ruilin's "Can China Really Implement Constitutionalism?" and Wang Xinlun's "Strengthening Party Rule and Continuing Political Tutelage," are all based on the current actual situation, hoping to cultivate a correct political concept. In addition, there are two articles on land issues, one is Qi Qisheng's "The Origin of China's Land Problem and Its Countermeasures," and the other is Li Youxi's "Rural Economy and Land Policy in the Song Dynasty," both of which have unique insights and are different from ordinary views. Zhang Sumin's "China's Economy After the Armistice in Italy" analyzes the various phenomena in China's economic circles in recent months in great detail.</p>

<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>"How do you maintain your life?" This is a very long journey. Aren't you already a grown-up boy?"</p>
<p>"Oh! Before my foot was injured, I was able to get by at first. People gave me food to eat, and I slept in farmhouses. I was always walking on the road during the day. I got lost because I wanted to take a shortcut, otherwise I would have arrived here earlier."</p>
<p>"But if you don't want to come in and live here again, what are you going to do?"</p>
<p>"I originally planned to come and see Tandy and you again: then go back to the city to do my old job, but I am too tired, so I just lay down on the haystack. If you hadn't found me, I would have left here before tomorrow morning."</p>
<p>"Aren't you happy that I found you?" Mrs. Shu looked at him while saying this, with a half-smiling and half-reproachful expression, while kneeling in front of him to examine his injured foot. Color gradually rose on Don's face, but his eyes were always above the bowls and dishes, and at the same time he said very softly: "No, teacher, I am happy, I want to stay, but I am afraid you..."</p>
<p>He didn't finish this sentence because Mama Pei had just arrived in the corridor and saw that his foot was very badly injured, and couldn't help but shout out.</p>
<p>"When did you get hurt?"</p>
<p>"Three days ago."</p>
<p>"Have you been walking in this state?"</p>
<p>"I have a cane. Every time I go to a stream, I wash it. A woman gave me a piece of cloth to temporarily wrap it up."</p>
<p>"Mr. Pei has to come and take a look immediately, and wrap it up properly," Mrs. Shu said, immediately rushing to the next room, deliberately leaving the door half open so that Don could hear everything that was going on.</p>
<p>"Fritz, that child has returned."</p>
<p>"Who? Don?"</p>
<p>"Exactly, Tandy first saw him outside the window, we called him, but he walked away and hid behind the haystack on the lawn. I just found him there, sleeping soundly, because of fatigue and pain, he no longer looks like a person. He ran away from Mr. Bei's side a month ago, and has been walking here ever since. He pretended not to want us to see him, just to come and take a look at us and then go to the city to do his old job. However, it is clear that he hoped to return here, so he did not fear any hardship and came straight here. He is waiting there now, not knowing if you are willing to forgive him and let him return?"</p>

<h3 id="e134">Carson and De Voe Win Hard Court Doubles Championship, Men's Singles Final Today <a href="#e134" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c134" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">134</a></h3>
<p>Wang Wenzheng vs. Carson promises a fierce battle; Mixed Doubles Final will also be resolved today.</p>
<p>The Hard Court Tennis Tournament is in its final stage. In addition to the Women's Singles Championship, which has already been decided, the Women's Doubles and Men's Doubles were also completed yesterday. Yesterday's match between Qiu Li and Cade was the most exciting, with applause rising frequently. There were only a little over a hundred spectators, but the situation was very tense. Today there is the Men's Singles final between Wang Wenzheng and Carson and the Mixed Doubles final. The two, Wang and Carson, are sure to have a fierce battle.</p>
<p>Qiu and Li Defeated by Their Opponents</p>
<p>At 2:00 PM, the doubles match between Qiu Feihai and Li Guangjun versus Carson and De Voe began. Qiu and Li were very careful because formidable opponents had arrived. Old Qiu worked very hard, and the battle was very tense. However, De Voe's smashes made Qiu and Li unable to respond, causing Cade to win the first two games. In the third game, it was Guangjun's turn to serve. Ah Li's serve was indeed powerful, winning back a game. Old Qiu exhausted all his strength and used his excellent shots, winning another game. By the fifth game, the two sides were not giving way to each other. De Voe's net play showed miraculous power, and Old Qiu's long shots were also excellent. The closeness of the score could not be exceeded, and the audience on both sides applauded continuously. After fighting to six-seven, Guangjun hit a high ball, and De Voe thought it was out of bounds, thus failing. In the sixth game, Carson worked hard to run and returned the ball. From then on, Old Qiu also used all his life's strength, with wonderful shots appearing frequently, coupled with Guangjun's net play, he even won two consecutive games. Cade could only shake his head frequently, but the good times did not last long. Under this absolute advantage of five to three, Old Qiu was physically exhausted, and his shots were also unable to achieve the desired effect, losing four consecutive games. Cade reversed the defeat into victory, which was a pity. The second and third sets were entirely under Cade's control. Although they won one or two games, what good was it? Moreover, they played extremely relaxed. As a result, three to zero, the Men's Doubles Championship was won by Carson and De Voe. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Carson De Voe 7-5 6-1 6-2 Qiu Feihai Li Guangjun</p>
<p>Mrs. Marl and Lam Win the Championship</p>
<p>Mrs. Marseille and Mrs. Hailes first defeated Auvalda and Trier at 12:30 PM with a score of two to zero to obtain the final rights. After the doubles match was over, they had to compete in the final with Mrs. Marl and Lam. Therefore, their physical strength was inevitably affected. However, the strength of the two, Marl and Lam, was very good. Although Mrs. Lam's hair was white, she was able to run, and both long shots and net play were possible. Marl's short volley was also good, so winning the championship was not accidental. Mrs. Hailes' baseline shots often made the opponent helpless, but Miss Marseille was too weak, resulting in failure. The results are as follows:</p>
<p>Marseille Hailes 6-1 6-4 Auvalda Trier (Semi-Final)</p>
<p>Marl Lam 6-3 6-2 Mrs. Hailes Miss Marseille (Final)</p>
<p>Today's Program is All Exciting</p>
<p>There are still three groups on today's program. If De Voe and Mrs. Marl can defeat Cole Qiu Trier, then they will compete in the final with Qiu Feihai Howell, competing for the championship. I don't know if the old Indian can avoid losing everything. Wang Wenzheng in the Men's Singles is ambitious and intends to win the championship, but his opponent is not weak and is Carson, who dominates Shanghai. Carson thinks that the championship is in his grasp, so the war must be fierce and the performance must be good. The schedule for today is recorded below:</p>
<p>10:30 AM</p>
<p>Mixed Doubles Semi-Final Mrs. Trier Cole Qiu vs. Mrs. Marl De Voe</p>
<p>2:00 PM</p>

<p>——Two to Zero——</p>
<p>Fudan lost due to slow movements and lack of fighting spirit, giving high hopes for this championship.</p>
<p>Yesterday's match between Guanghua and Fudan in the Chinese Football Association's Middle Character Group was no less than a championship match. In addition to the students from both schools, there were also many foreign guests. The battle was very tense. The match started at 3:00 PM. Fudan took the offensive immediately, but the forwards lacked connection, and the shots were not accurate, resulting in frequent loss of good opportunities. The slow movement of left winger Cheng Shichang was also a cause of the defeat. Guanghua's momentum was extremely strong, the defense was solid, and the forwards were active. Left winger Chen Shigeng started an uprising on the border and passed it to Dou Wen. Dou Wen took advantage of the situation with a kick, and the ball went into the net. Fudan lost this ball and fell into a slump, lacking fighting spirit. After changing fields and fighting again, Fudan's line was still scattered. Xu Jingcheng advanced with the ball single-handedly and kicked hard at ten yards, returning with success. Although Fudan intended to counterattack, it was too late. As a result, two to zero, Guanghua won, and the hope for this championship is very strong. The lineups are recorded as follows:</p>

<p>East China B won against China Police with a score of 5-0</p>
<p>In the Western Union Junior Cup preliminary round, East China B team faced off against the China Police team yesterday. Both sides sent their best and strongest players to the Shen Garden. East China played exceptionally fiercely. Youngster Zhang Jinhai, short and agile, scored four goals, exerting all his strength. Jia Youliang also demonstrated intelligence and bravery and performed quite well. In contrast, the China Police team's movements were slow and cumbersome. Like a lion trying to catch a rabbit, how could the China Police team be a match? As a result, East China won with a score of 5-0. The China Police team was utterly defeated, a truly miserable loss. The detailed report of yesterday's match is as follows:</p>
<p>Zhang Jinhai Scores and Breaks Records</p>
<p>As the silver whistle blew, Zhang Ziquan of the China Police team immediately kicked the ball forward. The battle began. Dada got the ball and quickly sent it towards East China's territory. Yin Zhengda saved a dangerous shot. Youliang made a successful foray, advancing along the side. The ball fell to Chen Yutian's feet. He saw an opportunity to shoot, but it went slightly high. Xiao Jia continued his efforts, sending the ball to the center. Wu Binghao wanted to add a touch, but he was too slow. Wu Xiquan had already taken over. Xiao Jia ran all over the field, exerting himself. Ma Jianzhang made a mistake in defense and conceded a penalty. Zhang Jinhai took the kick, opening the scoring for his team.</p>
<p>China Police Team's Miscalculations Lead to Nothing</p>
<p>Feng Nianhan received support from the veteran Huang Zhong in midfield and launched an attack towards the police goal. Yin Yaosheng remained calm and collected, gently catching the ball and sending it out. Zhang Ziquan, the center forward of the China Police team, led his troops through three checkpoints. He tried to find an opening, but Dong Zhaobin was too slow to catch up, resulting in nothing. Shortly after, Youliang and Jinhai combined, and Chang Song fulfilled his mission. Xiao Zhang, from fifteen yards out, shot with a strong force, and the police goal was breached again. At halftime, East China led with a score of 2-0.</p>
<p>Xiao Zhang Bravely Fights Alone</p>
<p>The game resumed with Xiao Zhang, single-handedly, entering no man's land. He turned and shot amidst the chaos. The ball bounced off the goalpost and into the net. Yin Zhasheng was unable to stop it. Liao Zhonggan of the China Police team was ordered to move to the front line. Da Dong's attack went slightly wide and became an outfield ball. Old Huang Zhong waved his flag and shouted. Chen Yutian roared. Xiao Zhang did not hold back, securing a good outcome.</p>
<p>Youliang Secretly Fires Cold Arrows in Front of the City</p>
<p>Chen Xianglong, desperate, hastily shot towards the police goal, but it went slightly high and returned. The Sun brothers then forwarded the ball. Youliang dribbled the ball forward, but Wu Xiquan could not stop him. Xiao Jia secretly fired a cold arrow in front of the city, hitting the bullseye again. Afterwards, the China Police team launched a strong counterattack, but their strength was insufficient. Shortly after, the final gong sounded. East China triumphantly retreated, returning to their formation. The starting lineups of both teams are as follows:</p>
<p>East China</p>
<p>Guan Dang'an</p>
<p>Chen Gongyu, Yin Zhengda, Chen Xianglong, Huang Duanhua, Sun Baoqing</p>
<p>Feng Nianhan, Wu Binghao, Chen Yutian, Zhang Jinhai, Jia Youliang</p>
<p>China Police</p>
<p>Yin Yaosheng</p>

<p>Qinghua Defeats Russian Army with a Score of 4-2</p>
<p>In the Western Union Junior Cup football match, Qinghua played against the Russian army yesterday at Jiaozhou Park. Qinghua's ball skills were refined, and their teamwork was excellent. Goalkeeper Tao Jianhua's performance was particularly brilliant, saving many dangerous shots. In contrast, the Russian army's formation was disorganized and of course, they could not compete. In the first half, Qinghua played against the wind but still managed to score three goals, which was not easy. In the second half, center forward Liao Shiming was injured and left the field, greatly weakening their strength. The enemy took advantage of this opportunity to score two goals. As a result, Qinghua won 4-2. Qinghua's first attempt with their new weapon overwhelmed the tenacious Russian army. The details of yesterday's match are recorded below:</p>
<p>Yu Qiaxing Opens the Scoring</p>
<p>At 3:00 PM, Qinghua first took the field in full gear. The Russian army entered the field, and the sound of the Hu Jia (a type of reed pipe) began. Qinghua took the initiative, dribbling the ball straight forward. The wind hindered them, and they were forced back. Qinghua's goal was in danger, but the blue-eyed players were flustered and did not succeed. Later, Qinghua got a corner kick opportunity. Wu Limin took the kick, and the landing point was excellent. Safutien headed the ball away. Yu Qiaxing attacked again, and the scoring opened. In the subsequent battle, the enemy's momentum was initially strong, but it was only a fleeting moment, and they soon calmed down again. Qinghua's Lin Zuoshi started an uprising on the border, and Wang Cuixing headed the ball in. Then, Jia Jiliang, feeling envious, did not want to be outdone and contributed three goals.</p>
<p>Tao Jianping Dives to Save</p>
<p>After lemon break, the teams switched sides, and the enemy's momentum increased greatly, directly threatening Qinghua's goal. Fortunately, goalkeeper Tao Jianhua dived to save, which was also dangerous. Qinghua's momentum revived, and the five tigers of the front line gave their all. The enemy's Golovlev inadvertently committed a foul and was penalized with a penalty. Jia Jiliang took the kick and lived up to expectations, making the score two pairs (4 goals). The Russian army could not bear the blank score. Bxesteerikov bravely advanced through three checkpoints. Qinghua's Chen and Hu could not stop him. With a kick of his hairy leg, the ball entered the net, pulling back one goal. Qinghua's Chen Xiaoping accidentally touched the ball with his hand, losing another goal. The situation gradually became relaxed. After that, neither side made any further achievements. The team lineups are recorded below:</p>
<p>Qinghua Team</p>
<p>Tao Jianhua</p>
<p>Chen Xiaoping, Hu Biyao</p>
<p>Xia Zhiming, Wang Boyong, Yu Qiaxing</p>
<p>Wu Limin, Jia Jiliang, Liao Shiming, Gan Cuixing</p>

<p>— Jian Fen</p>
<p>"No matter what it is: if you don't do it, even if it's easy, you won't succeed; conversely, even if it's difficult, as long as we keep doing it, we will eventually achieve victory." Children: This theory was proposed by Columbus, the discoverer of the New World. Why did he propose this theory? Because after Columbus discovered the New World, when he returned to his hometown, many friends gave him a banquet, partly to celebrate his success and partly to welcome him back. When the banquet was almost over, a friend stood up and said, "Who wouldn't discover a new continent? In my opinion, it's a very easy thing." Columbus heard this and asked a servant to bring an egg and said to that friend, "Friend, now please stand this egg upright!" That friend answered without thinking, "An egg is round and meant to roll. How can it stand upright?" After that friend finished speaking, Columbus calmly pierced a hole in one end of the egg and stood it upright on the table very steadily. When that friend saw Columbus's trick, he arrogantly said, "This is even easier, nothing strange about it; even a child can do it!" Thus, Columbus published the above theory.</p>
<p>Therefore, children, if we want to succeed in something, just talking about it is useless. Only by "doing" can we achieve victory!</p>

<p>— Yan Chonglou</p>
<p>Rousseau was a great thinker of the eighteenth century and the founder of the study of children's issues. He was the first to advocate the theory of human freedom and equality, making great contributions to society. In particular, concerning children's education, he elaborated on many brilliant treatises. He said: "We should develop children's rights and abilities from childhood." He also said: "We should use the power of example to make children's memories strong and their emotions stable." He also said: "The only means of treating children is natural punishment. For example, if a child breaks a windowpane, the cold wind blowing in will naturally cause the child pain. If this is the case, then the child will know that bad deeds have bad consequences and will definitely strive to improve." Rousseau believed that the power of education could expand children's existence and enable them to continue their activities.</p>
<p>Rousseau was French but was born in Geneva, Switzerland. His father was a watchmaker, and his mother was the daughter of a pastor. Rousseau's mother died after he was born! So he was entirely raised by his father and studied by his father's side. At the age of seven, he liked to read novels. Later, he gradually learned history and biography. He liked to read the biographies of forty-six famous Greeks and Romans. When he was nine years old, his father unfortunately fled because of a lawsuit. So Rousseau lived with relatives. At sixteen, he learned sculpture, but he was not interested, and his master was very abusive. Rousseau could not bear the suffering! So he escaped privately, wandering around France, until his money ran out, and he was in dire straits! Finally, he met someone who helped him and assisted him in making progress. On the one hand, he relied on his tireless efforts, and as a result, he became famous all over the world. Historically, most of the great figures went through hardships and difficulties in their childhood.</p>
<h3 id="e142">Square Eggs <a href="#e142" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c142" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">142</a></h3>
<p>— Chen Shicong</p>
<p>I think children must be very strange: where in the world would there be square eggs? Yes, eggs are always oval and never square. However, children, if you do as shown below, you can turn an oval egg into a square one. Today is Sunday, why don't children make this rare thing together!</p>
<p>Changing the shape of an egg is very simple. Just take an egg, put it in rice vinegar, and soak it for a day or two. The eggshell will soften and shrink. Then take a wooden box that matches the size of the egg, put the egg in the box, and soak it in water. In an hour or two, the eggshell will harden. Take it out of the box, and it will become a square egg. If you want to turn it into a triangle or hexagon, you can use the same method. But you just need to prepare models of various shapes in advance.</p>
<p>Children, there is nothing strange about this. It's just using chemistry. Because vinegar contains acid, and this acid has two functions: astringency and erosion, so it makes the eggshell soft and shrinks, changing its shape.</p>

<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>November 5th, Monday, sunny.</p>
<p>The school has changed again. All the class teachers have decorated the classrooms very exquisitely. Each has its own unique interest. Some belong to the magnificent, some express serenity, and some are very beautiful; our children's minds are all attracted by such an environment.</p>
<p>Our seats in the classroom have a certain rule, that is, the baojia (neighborhood self-policing system) grouping; one seat is one household, one row is one jia, with one jiazhang (head of the jia) elected by each household. The jiazhangs in each classroom then elect one baozhang (head of the bao), and the baozhangs of the whole school publicly elect one xiangzhang (head of the xiang). He is the highest leader of our children.</p>
<p>Children in each classroom should abide by various rules, which are all recorded in the baojia regulations. The baojia regulations are signed and sealed by each jiazhang (or with fingerprints), and the head of the household must also join. There is also a joint guarantee, guaranteeing that no accidents or violations of school rules will occur within the bao. If they occur, if one head of household violates school rules, the other heads of household will report to the xiangzhang at any time and submit it to the school. If they conceal and do not report, the heads of household in the same jia will also be subject to the same punishment. Therefore, after the baojia system is implemented, the students are all active on the right track. Moreover, they also understand the meaning of the baojia practiced in society; so I often persuade my neighbors of this principle.</p>
<p>Since our school implemented the baojia, the children no longer have a system of people who specialize in playing. Because we want to handle household registration changes. Therefore, the baojia is a good people's organization in society and a good students' organization in school. Children will all be social people in the future, and this is worthy of our deep attention!</p>
<h3 id="e145">Autumn Leaves <a href="#e145" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c145" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">145</a></h3>
<p>— Dazhai</p>
<p>The green leaves are so cute! Once autumn deepens, they will gradually fall, and even the evergreen trees such as pine and cypress contain some autumn meaning, with some old colors, unlike the verdant and green in spring and summer.</p>
<p>Many poets write poems about autumn, describing scenery and emotions, each with its own advantages, but no one has written the reason why the leaves fall in autumn in their poems, which cannot but be considered special; we now study, not only to be elegant literary men, but to be practical scientists; we must not only know the reasons for things on the surface, but we must know the reasons why by research; if things are like the autumn leaves, perhaps there will be some new discoveries in the future; the so-called autumn leaves are just an example.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, why do autumn leaves fall? Because the autumn leaves form a wheel line at the point where they connect to the branch, and this wheel line has a separation tissue, which is composed of several layers of soft cells. After the cells die, the cell membrane is destroyed, and the vascular bundles in the leaf will be cut off by it, so the leaves of the whole tree will gradually fall.</p>
<p>Also, the power of the sun in autumn is weak, and the heat of the sun cannot make the tree absorb enough nutrients. In addition, the weather in autumn is relatively dry, so it needs to evaporate more water. Since it is difficult for the tree to absorb nutrients, it has to save consumption, so it cuts off part of the leaves—the nutrient-consuming organs—to save nutrients and keep them for winter use. When spring comes, it will slowly return to its original state, and it will be green branches again.</p>
<h3 id="e146">Children's Science Lecture Book—(2) Printing and Binding <a href="#e146" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c146" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">146</a></h3>
<p>— Lin Yin</p>
<p>Last time I talked about the printing of a book, which is an important record of cultural history. However, there is still a drawback to printing like that. That is, after a book is printed, the typesetter must return the type to the original type case (Figure 1). The next time it is reprinted, it must be typeset in the same way, and typesetting and printing take a long time. In addition, after the type is heavily pressed by the printing press, it gradually wears out, and the strokes are not clear the next time it is used. So an Englishman, Stanhope, invented the clay plate in 1804. He covered the type bed with clay, pressed it into a negative, and then poured molten lead into a positive lead plate (Figure 2) for printing, which was much more convenient. However, keeping the lead plate is very expensive, and the clay plate is easily broken after melting and pouring. That year, the Frenchman Xero invented the paper plate, so only the paper mold needs to be preserved, and there is no need to keep the lead plate. The printing industry has moved further on the road to progress.</p>
<p>That method of typesetting and printing is called movable type printing. It was originally invented in China. However, the Chinese themselves did not know how to improve it. When it was transmitted to Europe, after foreign research, it was re-transmitted to China, and we had to learn their methods instead.</p>
<p>Put the lead plate on the printing frame, brush it with ink, and cover it with white paper, and you can print it out sheet by sheet. After printing, it must be taken for binding. The first step in binding is to arrange the page numbers. Arrange the printed sheets in order according to the page numbers. The name for this in binding is called arranging the book (Figure 3). After arranging, bind them with thread or use a machine to bind them with lead wire (Figure 4). Then put on the cover, and it becomes a book. But it must go through a cutting process to make the four sides of the book neat (Figure 5). In this way, a book is completed.</p>
<h3 id="e147">Stone Mortar Great Immortal <a href="#e147" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c147" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">147</a></h3>
<p>— Teacher Artisan</p>
<p>In a remote rural village, there lived ten or so farming families. During the busy farming season in summer, the farmers all went to work in the fields. One of them had an old stone mortar in their field. Near noon, a dark cloud suddenly appeared in the sky, and soon there was lightning, thunder, and a heavy rain. Coincidentally, a passerby passed by there, opened a paper umbrella, and temporarily sat in the stone mortar to wait for the rain to pass before continuing on. After a while, the rain became heavier, and a large amount of water accumulated. When the rain stopped and the sky cleared, the head of the household returned home and suddenly discovered that the stone mortar was completely dry, without a single drop of rainwater. Such a heavy rain fell, so why was there not a drop of water in the stone mortar? Wasn't this because an immortal had descended to protect the stone mortar? Everyone in the village came to watch, and everyone said that the stone mortar was very old and must have become an immortal.</p>
<p>A poor Taoist nearby deliberately pretended to be mysterious and fabricated stories, publicizing it, and erected a flagpole with a pennant, calling it the "Stone Mortar Great Immortal." Soon people from all directions came to offer incense and worship. The Taoist collected incense money, and in less than two years, he actually built a temple to enshrine the stone mortar. It became famous far and wide, and was effective in one region.</p>
<p>The passerby passed through the old place again for the second time and suddenly saw the newly built Stone Mortar Great Immortal Temple, with many pious men and women offering incense and worshiping inside. Inquiring about the reason, he couldn't help but smile. He told everyone the story of sitting in the stone mortar to avoid the rain two years ago. Everyone suddenly understood. From then on, the Stone Mortar Great Immortal was no longer effective.</p>

<p>The magic cage is a moving toy. It can change and can also be considered a simple magic trick. Children, when you make it to play, cut the picture in the newspaper as it is and stick it on the original cardboard. Fill in the colors according to the numbers, or you can draw it on the cardboard and do the same way, and it will become a very interesting toy.</p>
<p>First, you need to prepare all kinds of materials, scissors, chisels, thick cardboard, colored glue. After you prepare the materials, cut out the picture (1) and picture (2) in the newspaper and stick them on the original cardboard. Still, cut the cardboard as it is. After the glue is slightly dry, use a chisel to dig out the blank of picture (1) according to the lines, in the order of the numbers (red, yellow, blue, green). Then insert the left and right ends of picture (2) into the left and right narrow holes of picture (1), as shown in picture (3). Move your hands left and right, and it will be very fun!</p>

<p>Just as I was about to fly away, the turtledove suddenly opened its eyes again. It said to me: "Goodbye! You are tired of singing. My name is Groli. I hope you remember me often!"</p>
<p>I hurriedly replied: "Beautiful Groli, you are gentle and lovely. I am willing to live for you and even die for you, but your feathers are peach-colored, and I don't have such good fortune!"</p>
<p>(4)</p>
<p>I flew back to Paris with a belly full of questions. As I was flying, my head suddenly bumped into the head of another bird, who was flying over from the other side. This bump was unexpected and very fierce, causing both of us to crash onto a treetop. Fortunately, we didn't fall to the ground. I steadied myself and looked at the other side, thinking that he would definitely quarrel with me. When I saw him, I saw that he was a crow of all colors, his neck seemed to be bigger than mine, and he had a high crown on his forehead, showing a heroic spirit. His face was raised high in the air, with a proud and arrogant look, but he didn't mean to quarrel with me. We greeted each other politely, apologized to each other, and started talking. I first asked him his name and also asked him which country he flew from.</p>
<p>He said to me: "I'm surprised, you didn't recognize me, maybe you and we are not of the same kind?"</p>
<p>I replied: "Sir, to tell you the truth, I don't know which kind I belong to. Everyone always asks me like this. They must be betting on me there."</p>
<p>"You're kidding," he said, "I saw your feathers and knew you were my brothers. You certainly belong to that very famous and very respected white parrot family." (To be continued)</p>

<p>— Zhang Dejun, Sixth Grader of Shanghai Xinye Primary School</p>
<p>The Children's Year Implementation Committee organized a children's speech contest, and the main topic of the speech was: "About Children's Year and Relief to Children in Disaster Areas." I felt quite interested in speaking, so I eagerly asked my teacher to sign me up to prepare for the topic. After two weeks of practice and guidance from the teacher and criticism from the students, I excitedly attended the speech contest held at the People's Education Center on the 28th of last month with my classmate Shen Yaqin. That day, according to the chairman's report, "more than eighty people attended." I thought: There are so many talented people, I definitely have no hope of winning. But, thinking about it, my speech was not bad; the teachers and friends also criticized me that my speaking and posture were not bad either, I thought maybe there was a glimmer of hope! After all the children had finished speaking, after a while, the chairman announced the rankings, calling out the numbers one by one. When they called them all, my number was not there, and my heart jumped. I failed. At that time, I was very ashamed, resentful, and almost cried. The teachers and friends tried their best to comfort me, what is there to be ashamed of, failure is the mother of success, as long as you work hard in the future, if you have the opportunity, you will definitely have a good harvest. I thought: That's right, why be discouraged? So I am still very interested in speaking now and I am not discouraged.</p>

<h3 id="e152">Finance: The Gold Market Felt Increasingly Bleak Midday <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>Only 1.90 Yuan Circulating, Resulting in a Drop of Three Cents</p>
<p>The gold market yesterday was stable and lacked changes.  Throughout the morning, fluctuations were only around 1.90 yuan. Combined with the pre-abolition of tael exchange, there was only slightly more than one tael's worth of turnover. Onlookers within the industry were even more passive, with only about one-tenth showing some activity. Observing the trend, there will likely be no unexpected fluctuations in the near future. Some in the industry simply abandoned gold like worn-out shoes and turned to investing in the commodities market.  Therefore, even at the opening of the market, it felt very bleak. In the early morning, the overseas silver market saw London rise and the US remain flat. The Mundell forward silver price was unchanged, up or down by no more than 1.5%. Exchange rates rose slightly, and the customs gold unit shrank by half a penny. The Central Bank's listed rates showed both the British and American rates were flat. The customs gold unit also remained unchanged, but the standard gold price fell to 1150 yuan. The opening was slightly lower in the morning and then slightly weak, but buyers took advantage of the low prices to maintain the market. Mobil came to settle, and US dollars were easily pulled up. The HSBC listed rates showed the British rate flat and the US rate up by 0.0625.  After that, trading was again quiet, and morale dissipated. Only small fluctuations of a few cents occurred between 6.50 yuan and 7.10 yuan, which was extremely sluggish.  Sometimes, there was simply no trading. Later, as Chinese merchants slightly bought up US dollars, the domestic market tightened and gradually rose.  Major players took advantage of the high prices to supply slightly, which easily brought the market back to even. Indian silver was predicted to increase by one anna. However, short sellers finally covered their positions, and the trend at noon was still stable. Swap points were still offered by the long side at ten yuan yesterday. After analyzing the midday market situation,</p>
<p>The morning opening was 1147 yuan, a drop of one yuan from the previous close. Chunyuan, Yongda, Decheng, and Zhichang sold strips, falling to 6 yuan. Huixiang, Hengyu, Fuyu, and Yongli bought strips at low prices, rising to 7.10 yuan. Fuxingyong took the opportunity to supply strips, falling to 6.20 yuan. Mobil bought December US dollars at 0.0625. Dachengyi, Fengyonglai advanced, and then rose again to 7.10 yuan. Anticipating that HSBC would announce the British rate flat and the US rate up by 0.0625, a large fluctuation occurred. Qingfayong sold strips, once falling to 6.50 yuan. After that, the transaction volume was scarce, and there were no more fluctuations, but due to the buying of Dacheng, Chunyuan, and Yongzhi, it rose to 7 yuan. Yifengyong and Huixiang also slowly rose to 7.90 yuan. Fuxingyong, Yuanmaoyong, Yiyong, and Yuqianchangxiang sold slightly, falling to 7 yuan. Hengxing advanced, Qingfayong also took strips, and then gradually rose to 7.90 yuan. Fuxingyong supplied at high prices and then stabilized. The noon closing was 1147.70 yuan.</p>
<p>The settlement price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, fell to 1150 yuan.  According to the closing price, it was about 2 yuan lower than the previous close, equaling the previous closing. The current month's registered debt was 1138 yuan, and December's was 1148 yuan. The morning water refill was 1138 yuan. Refined gold was reduced by 3 yuan to 1144 yuan. The spot market was stable, with Tianjin goods adding 2 yuan but lacking transactions. Supplying refined gold added 3 yuan and was bought by Yingfengheng for more than one hundred taels. Swap points were offered by Yingfengheng to Shengda for 35 strips at 10 yuan, and the overall trend has stabilized.</p>
<p>The in-house transaction was even more quiet. In summary, Yuanmaoyong, Chunyuanyong, Hengyu, Fuyu, Hengchangyong, Yifengyong, and Hengxing were on the buying side, while Qingfayong, Yingfengheng, Dacheng, Dingkang, and Fuxingyong were on the selling side. Chunyuanyong and Dacheng first sold and then bought. Dalian Shunli, Wanxing, and the Guangdong group Shengtda Hengxing were all very quiet.</p>
<p>Upon inspection, the midday market was even more sluggish. The morning opening was 1147 yuan, and the noon closing was 117.70 yuan. The highest price was 1147.90 yuan, and the lowest price was 1146 yuan, a fluctuation of only 1.90 yuan. As a result, it fell slightly by 3 cents from the previous close. The midday transaction volume was only 3,549 strips.</p>
<p>The 12th of this month is the anniversary of the Premier's birthday, and the Gold Exchange will also be closed for one day.</p>
<p>Regarding the November strips that have not yet been swapped, the long side includes Shengda, Yifengyongheng, Tianfeng, Zhengchangxiang, Shunli, Chunyuanyong, Fuan, Runchang, Yuxiangfeng, and Yuanmaoyong, totaling 13 firms. The short side includes Yingfengheng for more than one hundred strips, and Dafengheng for a small number. The total number of these firms is only 182 strips.</p>
<p>For the December position, the long side includes Shenfeng for more than 2,600 strips, Fuxingyong and Yuguangyong for more than 800 each, Shunli for more than 500, Fuyu, Hanheng, Tongtaichang, and Dingkang for more than 400 each, Chunyuan Yonghuixiang for more than 300 each, Dada, Zhaofeng, Changyi, and Cheng for more than 200 each, Yuyu, Zhentai, Wanxing, Riyuan, Yuxinxiang, and Wanfeng Tianchengxiang for more than 100 each.

<p>According to yesterday's foreign dispatches, London's long-term exchange rates were flat, but rose by .0625 in the long run. Some market sources said that the long-term rate turned stagnant after the close. New York's silver market remained unmoved. The Mundell forward silver price was unchanged, or decreased by as much as 1.5. London spot gold decreased by half a penny. The British rate increased by a half against the US rate, the British rate rose 13 pounds against the French rate, the US rate increased by .25 against the British rate, and the US rate remained unmoved against the French rate. The exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices. The British rate was 1 shilling, 2 pence, .5625 and .625 paired; the US rate was 29.9375 yuan. Compared to the previous close, both the British and US exchange rates were unmoved. The Central Bank's listed rates showed both the British and US rates flat, and the customs gold units were unmoved. The market remained unchanged after opening and the overall feeling was normal. The HSBC listed rates showed the British rate flat and the US rate increased by .0625. The market moved slightly because Mobil took advantage of the low prices to make purchases and maintained stability. Banks supplied slightly, and there were rumors that Sassoon was supplying shillings, loosening the market slightly. Banks took advantage of the low prices to maintain stability. Chinese merchants came to settle accounts, gradually tightening the market. However, Bank of Communications was still actively conducting swap trades. Indian silver was predicted to increase by one anna. The final process remained unchanged, extending to the closing. The near-term selling prices were: the British rate was 1 shilling, 2 pence, .5625; the US rate was 29.875 yuan.

<p>Yesterday was Saturday, and since it was the last day of the Western merchants' autumn races, most foreign businesses and firms closed early. The market situation felt quite relaxed, and the morale of the money market also decreased accordingly. The interbank bill trading saw foreign interbank lending rates unmoved, remaining at 0.16% in the morning and afternoon. Therefore, the transfer volume increased again, totaling over 4.7 million, with over 400,000 in new transactions, over 300,000 in afternoon transactions, and over 500,000 in transactions through the Small General Association. As for adding water to checks, since there were many empty slots available and the market was stable, adding water never started and was always a blank check.

<h3 id="e155">Securities: Bond Market Sentiment Extremely Enthusiastic <a href="#e155" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c155" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">155</a></h3>
<p>Further Increases of Several Cents to Over Three Yuan</p>
<p>Yesterday, the market price on the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange continued to rise and gradually gained strength. The rumors of banks reducing deposit interest rates were widespread. The Trust Bureau of the Central Bank is about to establish a special department for real estate mortgage lending. Market prosperity is imminent, and there is no way to fabricate rumors. Major players in the market, such as No. 4, were the most eager to buy in. Numbers 35, 54, and 69, among others, also absorbed substantial amounts. Most retail investors were still short sellers. No. 78 added to their short positions, while No. 48 maintained a balanced position. Yesterday's process was based on delivery relationships, with only three rounds of trading. In the first round, No. 69 aggressively bought up recently skyrocketing demobilization bonds, which rose by 2.2 yuan in the near term and even more, by 2.5 yuan, in the long term. The fervor of the market was unprecedented. Other bonds also generally trended upward, gaining anywhere from several cents to 1.35 yuan. North Bank's buying appetite was also extremely strong. After the afternoon opening, the demobilization bonds continued to rise by 3-5 cents. Later, as No. 48 slightly sold off, several types of bonds slightly fell back by 1-4 cents. However, starting from the 23rd, they returned to high levels again, increasing by 2-7 cents. Among them, the long-term second customs bond traded at a market price of 58.4 yuan, with No. 4 buying 3 million from No. 78. It has been rare in recent years to see such a large number of shares traded in a single transaction. Trading slowed down at the closing, with the 19th Customs bond slightly weaker by about 1 cent, while the rest further increased by 1-7 cents. At the very end, the regular 696 was slightly lower. Overall, the trend was easier to rise than to fall, and the future has the potential to see new highs. As a result, market prices generally rose, gaining anywhere from several cents to over three yuan. The total transaction volume was approximately 2 million several hundred thousand yuan. The resulting gains and losses are compared and listed below (unit: yuan):</p>

<h3 id="e156">New Peaks Seen in Industrial and Public Utility Stocks <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>According to a report from the Sun Yu Yang Company yesterday (8th), the New York stock market was active in the late trading session, with prices steadily rising. Except for railway stocks, which were affected by a decrease in freight volume, almost all other stocks rose. The industrial stock index rose to its highest level since July 21, 1931, and the public utility stock index rose by 1.4% from its lowest point in 1935, reaching its highest point since February 8, 1934. Trading was frequent at the opening, with individual transactions ranging from 1,000 shares to 50,000 shares in the public utility sector. In the small exchange, one transaction even reached a massive 110,000 shares. The City Power Company saw a frantic rise at the beginning, with many bulls taking profits at high prices. Small-scale speculation gradually declined. The court's favorable ruling on the low-loan court case and the final passage of the Keller-Leavitt Act were not significantly related. However, this ruling, which concerns experiments to remove the New Deal, was enough to ignite the enthusiasm of the current anti-New Deal sentiment. Therefore, the market trend ultimately rose again. Small exchange stock indices also rose, and the bond market was active, with public utility bonds being particularly strong. The total daily transaction volume was 3.35 million shares. The Dow Jones indices are listed below:</p>
<p>Date	7th	8th	Change</p>
<p>30 Industrial Stocks	143.40	144.25	Up 0.85</p>
<p>20 Railroad Stocks	35.46	35.09	Down 0.37</p>

<h3 id="e157">Cotton Yarn: Bulls Continue to Push Up Cotton Yarn Prices <a href="#e157" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c157" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">157</a></h3>
<p>The yarn market continues to advance, and market sentiment is gradually improving. Most speculators do not underestimate cotton yarn prices after the change to the legal tender system. They adopt a "buy on dips" strategy, resulting in a concentration of long positions. Sellers are mostly retail investors. Therefore, the pushing power is unusually strong when a reaction occurs. However, current yarn merchants are concerned about an increase in future stored yarn due to high prices and low demand.</p>
<p>Long-term yarn up another yuan</p>
<p>The yarn pre-market opening saw all months opening high, and the market situation felt particularly brisk. With good news from American cotton, the bulls' sentiment was firm, and floating investors also came to cover their positions. Market prices gradually rose, with all months ultimately rising by 1.8-2.6 yuan. In the afternoon opening, the long side continued to push up prices. However, current yarn sales were particularly narrow, and spot yarn transactions were extremely few. The market sentiment was calm, and market prices slightly retreated. It is said that Mr. Wu came to help stabilize the market. As a result, all months fell by 0.6-0.7 cents compared to the morning closing price. An examination reveals: Da Fu sold 900 bales, Jin Chang 1,200 bales, Shen Ji 1,650 bales, Ren Feng 1,600 bales, Chang Feng Yi Hang 150 bales, Run Kang 900 bales, Yu Da 850 bales, Shen Chang 2,500 bales. Tong Ji bought 700 bales, Yu Da 1,100 bales, Da Feng 1,850 bales, Chang Yu 1,000 bales, Tong He 1,100 bales, Ming De 1,150 bales, and Sen Kang 950 bales, Yi Chang 850 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn	Highest Price	Lowest Price	Closing Price	Change	Inventory</p>
<p>November	193.5	192.6	192.8	Up 1.30	12,400</p>
<p>December	194.3	193.6	193.6	Up 1.10	41,400</p>

<p>April	197.2	196.1	196.5	Up 1.80	8,250</p>
<p>Total	173,050</p>
<p>Yarn sales of only 400 bales</p>
<p>Current yarn sales are extremely clear. The entire day's statistics showed that various groups bought only 407 bales. Prices rose by one yuan, and thread rose by four yuan. The purchase amounts for each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Ningbo	6	Mainland	204	Colleagues	52</p>
<p>Changsha	105	Wuhu	25	Nanjing	15</p>
<p>The cotton market is trending firm, and the surge is extremely strong. The fourth American cotton estimate was released, with a production amount of 11,141,000 bales, a decrease of 323,000 bales compared to the previous 11,464,000 bales. As a result, buyers' sentiment became firmer, and the pushing force was even stronger. At the same time, the market rumored that export transactions were picking up, and market prices were rising steadily.</p>
<p>Zhengbiao rose by six, seven, and eight cents</p>
<p>The pre-market opening of standard cotton saw all months rise in a straight line. With the American cotton report favoring the long side, prices rose by 15 points, and Indian cotton also rose by 2 rupees. The market sentiment was firm, and the buying interest in the market was particularly strong. However, Changhe's long positions were being sold off in large quantities, and Rui Da also came to sell short. Still, it was difficult to curb the buying trend. As a result, all months rose by five, six, or seven cents to one yuan compared to the previous day's closing price. In the afternoon opening, the long side Mr. Wang came to buy again, and the pushing force was very strong. The market sentiment remained tight. However, when the transaction volume reached the heart of the market, it was heard that the yarn market was weak, and a slight fall was seen. As a result, all months fell by 0.5 cents to 0.3 yuan compared to the morning closing price. An examination reveals: Yu Da sold 4,400 dan, Da Fu 9,700 dan, Geng Feng 3,600 dan, Shen Chang 2,100 dan, Rui Da 8,400 dan, Yuan Yi 4,700 dan, Chang He 10,500 dan, Tong He 4,300 dan, and Yi Kang 5,700 dan.

<p>Wall Street and Brokers Unanimously Buy</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened and advanced, and the market situation was active. Prices rose by 5-7 points. The market transaction was more prosperous than on any report publishing day this quarter. Good news from Liverpool and Egypt, and foreign merchants buying in, were the main reasons for the rise. Later, Southern sellers and the long side locked in profits, and market prices softened. After the government estimates were released, the public bought in, and selling decreased. Wall Street and brokers unanimously bought in. Liverpool also bought the larger margin. The price consequently soared rapidly. Before closing, some of the long side locked in profits. As a result, spot prices rose 15 points, and futures rose 15-17 points. Heisler estimated this week's factory consumption to be 378,000 bales. Liverpool's inventory was 200,000 bales. English spot cotton rose 5 points, and futures rose 12-13 points. Indian cotton firmed due to good foreign news and Japanese merchants buying in. The result was that Pingle rose 1.5-1.75 rupees, Aomura rose 1.75-2.5 rupees, and Bairuxi rose 2 rupees. The original telegram records are as follows (8th telegram):</p>

<p>Yesterday, when the flour market opened in the morning, prices for various months fluctuated but remained stable overall. As for foreign wheat prices, Chicago rose by 14 points, and Canada rose by 12 points. Market sentiment, influenced by the slight increase in foreign wheat prices, led to a slight increase in bids for various months, about one cent higher than the closing prices of the previous day. However, trading by flour mills was sluggish, and although stable, there was a lack of enthusiasm. When the market opened in the afternoon, factory owners remained cautious, but outside buyers were quite active, causing futures prices to rise rapidly. Generally, people believed that due to the limited supply of raw materials and the uncertain prices of foreign wheat, prices remained stable.</p>

<p>When the wheat market opened in the morning, trading was still quiet for all months, and bids were similar to the previous day. In the afternoon, trading in near-term contracts was scarce. The futures market was slightly boosted by the continued good performance of the flour market, which improved market sentiment. However, trading in various contracts did not show a significant increase due to a lack of activity from speculators. Compared to other months, prices rose by four, five, or six cents. The current wheat market has very few deliveries. Due to millers rushing to buy, high-grade wheat rose by another two cents. Shandong wheat was bid at $4.87, Mingguang wheat at $4.85, Shaoxing and Taizhou wheat at $4.68, and Hankou wheat at $4.60. Fuxin purchased 800 bags, Xinda purchased 700 bags, and Shenda purchased 500 bags.</p>

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, there were more than fifty suppliers (with a total of over ten thousand piculs), with Bo Dao rice being the most abundant, followed by new Japonica. However, the new grains were damp and soft and could not be stored for long, leading to a continuous surge in supply. With thick accumulations in the wharves, sellers were eager to sell, resulting in an extremely sluggish market and a further price decline. Early Japonica rice varieties such as Hou Zao continued to drop by five or six cents, and new Bo Dao rice fell by six or seven cents. Only the Bao Xiao Jin Qing gang took the opportunity to purchase, reaching over two thousand bags, so the high-quality grains were two or three cents higher than the lower-quality ones. Du Jian rice followed the drop by six cents, and foreign Jian rice fell by seven or eight cents. Although this price decrease occurred during the period of falling orders, it also presented the same pattern. Only Yin Yuan rice, due to its scarcity, recovered slightly by a few cents. Looking at the overall trend, with the abundant accumulation and the pessimistic sentiment, it would be difficult to stabilize.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) There were fifty-six or fifty-seven suppliers, with more than twenty or thirty boats stored in the river. Various grains in the market were unpopular, and the morning market was exceptionally quiet. Later, due to customers bidding low and demanding sales, the market price of new Japonica high-quality grains dropped by two or three cents, and medium-quality grains fell by three or four cents. Bai Ge Bo Dao rice was sold off at varying prices, from five to seven cents. Foreign Jian high-quality grains dropped by a small two or three cents, and medium-quality grains also dropped by a small amount. Du Jian and Bu Jian rice followed the drop by a small two or three cents. Bai Yuan rice continued to arrive, but retail sales were not active, also dropping by a small three or four cents. Bran and other grains also decreased by about two cents.</p>
<h3 id="e163">Customer Xian Rice Continues to Fall, Foreign Rice Stagnates <a href="#e163" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c163" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">163</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, both foreign rice and customer Xian rice markets became quiet. Foreign rice was held up by merchants, and buyers were cautious, resulting in no single bag transactions. Customer Xian rice continued to arrive, but merchants had already stopped purchasing. The Northern Ocean Gang's stored rice had not yet been fully loaded, and new transactions were also halted. Due to the increasing number of boats arriving from the river, prices had already fallen. Also, with the recent rumors subsiding, consumers no longer resumed stockpiling. As a result, the market had limited demand. Only 130 bags of Yong rice, 400 bags of Wen Tai rice, and 100 bags of Ji rice were sold in the entire market. Yong late rice fell slightly due to its high price, while Wen Tai rice fell slightly by three or four cents due to the large amount of stock and arrivals. Other rice types were sluggish by one or two cents. All were handled by the market.</p>
<h3 id="e164">Sugar Market: Over a Thousand Bags of Domestic Qing and Red Sugar Opened <a href="#e164" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c164" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">164</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market trend was flat. The guild set the price for 24 crude granulated white spot goods at $21.95. Re-export goods were priced at $6.90, but no deals were made. There were no changes in this factory's refined white sugar and eastern red and white sugars. The merchants opened over a hundred bags of genuine refined red sugar at $16.30, up three cents from yesterday. The Jian gang opened over a thousand bags of assorted red, white, and Qing sugar. White sugar ranged from about $18 to $15.67, red sugar from about $15 to $14.50, and sliced Qing sugar at $11. Prices decreased for lower grades, with sliced Qing sugar slightly down, all others had risen compared to before.</p>
<h3 id="e165">North-South Goods: Small-Grain Longan Arrives, Inventory Tight <a href="#e165" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c165" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">165</a></h3>
<p>Due to poor harvests in various producing areas this year, the supply of small-grade longan is particularly scarce. As a result, it is already feeling tight. Recent arrivals have been extremely sporadic. Yesterday, the merchants all opened for business. Prices for small and medium grades rose by varying amounts of two or three yuan, and new large-grain longan also rose by three or four yuan. Prices for old small-grain longan also rose, while large-grain longan remained relatively flat. It is said that the inventories in various places are already depleted, and the source of supply will inevitably gradually decrease.</p>
<h3 id="e166">Silk and Tea: Autumn Racing Affects Green Tea Trading <a href="#e166" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c166" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">166</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, green tea trading was slightly sluggish. British firms were extremely busy due to the upcoming autumn horse racing finals, resulting in little buying interest. In the entire city, only firms such as Xie He and Jin Long purchased a total of over 190 chests of high-grade and needle-grade green tea. However, selling prices remained firm. Chinese tea merchants were all firm in their attitude due to the dwindling market inventory and strong foreign sales. The overall trend seemed unlikely to weaken.</p>
<h3 id="e167">Hardware: This Factory's Round Nail Prices Rise, Sales Decline <a href="#e167" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c167" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">167</a></h3>
<p>Since the price of round nails rose to seven yuan, customer business has suddenly decreased. Sales from the hardware trade and construction gangs on this street have also been very limited recently. The market situation is exceptionally weak, and standards have shown a tendency to decline secretly. For large transactions and cash deals, prices can be one or two cents lower. It is heard that only three or four hundred barrels were sold in the market yesterday.</p>
<h3 id="e168">White Lead Price Rises One Yuan <a href="#e168" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c168" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">168</a></h3>
<p>The market opening price for white lead yesterday was twenty-five yuan per dan, another yuan higher than before. However, there were not many purchases from copper factories, so it was quite quiet. However, there were some purchases from customers, so the market situation was not too cold. It is reported that over two hundred dan were sold yesterday, opened by a hardware store in the French Concession.</p>

<h3 id="e170">On Unity <a href="#e170" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c170" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">170</a></h3>
<p>— Zou Hui</p>
<p>In his closing remarks at the Sixth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, Committee Member Yu Youren said, "...Successive floods and droughts, the tense international environment, and the impact of global economic changes are increasing the difficulties faced by our nation, already severely troubled. We cannot deny the hardship of the struggles and efforts made by the entire nation over the past ten months, but we must point out that to overcome this extremely difficult period, we still need greater sincerity and unity, and we need ten or a hundred times more effort. To save the nation and ensure its survival, we must concentrate national power and enrich the people's strength, using our own struggling power to overcome the difficulties of the environment..." These words are truly what everyone wants to say and are the hopes that everyone cherishes day and night. The so-called "sincerity," the so-called "unity," and the so-called "power of self-struggle" are undoubtedly the only driving forces for China's renewal amidst the current national crisis.</p>
<p>"But what exactly constitutes true unity? Although this has become a cliché, in today's high tide of calls for unity, it is indeed necessary to re-evaluate its value. In the past, the banner of unity has been hoisted by those in power, and the conch shell of unity has been blown by those with influence, but in the end, the conch shell was broken, the banner was shattered, and the situation of disintegration reappeared. Therefore, a union based on temporary interests cannot escape being a mere alliance of convenience and is definitely not unity. Today, the trend of promoting national unity for the great goal of jointly overcoming the national crisis is certainly gratifying, but we still cannot help but hope that a true 'affectionate sincerity' can arise between every member, like a natural adhesive creating a cohesive and solidifying effect. Only in this way can we be united forever and never separated.</p>
<p>To achieve true unity, we believe that at least the following three points should be met:</p>
<p>1. Group consciousness: We humans live under the social organization of a group of people, and individuals cannot go beyond the influence of society. Therefore, individualism and free action often hinder the common order of the masses, and the eruption of individual desires is the main culprit in undermining the group. Therefore, to realize the great premise of unity, we must absolutely abandon egoism and cultivate a concept of always being for the group.</p>
<p>2. Spirit of sacrifice: The so-called sacrifice contains two major meanings: first, from a negative perspective, in order to complete the will or welfare of the group, one must first sacrifice one's own opinions or interests; second, from a positive perspective, for the happiness and benefit of the public, as a member of the group, we must not stand idly by and watch success or failure, but should go through fire and water without hesitation. This is the expression of a positive spirit of sacrifice.</p>
<p>3. Disciplined life: A romantic lifestyle manifested in the spirit is bound to be scattered and disorderly. Disorder and lack of discipline are fatal to unity. Only by cultivating a strict and disciplined life can we stimulate scattered hearts and unite separated wills.</p>
<p>Humanity's need for unity did not begin today. From ancient times to the present, those who unite survive, and those who are individual perish.</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>This has almost become an iron principle of history. In the ancient, uncivilized era, wild beasts roamed the land, and an individual's strength could not match the fierce beasts. Thus, the phenomenon of living in groups arose, which is the original symbol of unity. Later, the concept of family arose, uniting clans to resist other clans. Then, nationalism arose, uniting one nation to compete with other nations. A history of humanity seems to be nothing but a record of unity. Originally, the destiny of humanity lies not in mutual struggle, but in mutual compassion; not in mutual exclusion, but in mutual assistance. People should offer a naked heart to each other, proceeding towards our common goal. However, even today, there are still a few ambitious individuals on earth with stubborn minds, who are still dreaming of inflicting cruelty on others. For the sake of the great unity of all humanity, we must take bold actions to eliminate the rebellious elements. On the one hand, we should unite the strength of our people to seek self-reliance. On the other hand, we must unite the oppressed nations of the world to fight together. As the Western saying goes, "Unity is strength." Looking at Abyssinia today, I am even more convinced.</p>

<p>— Li</p>
<p>I often encounter friends who are not yet well-acquainted wanting me to join their mahjong battles at a certain time, but these good intentions are all rejected by my strange habit of never playing mahjong. The reason I don't know how to play mahjong is because I didn't have a suitable learning environment growing up, but that's not entirely true. My grandfather and uncles were all very enthusiastic about playing mahjong, and in my childhood, my grandfather often took me to sit quietly by one corner of their table, watching them shuffle and sort the tiles. They played with great enthusiasm, from noon to dusk, from night to late at night, and I could even sit with them until midnight. I understood the terms for the different tile suits early on, like "Wan," "Suo," and "Tong." I also understood what "Pong," "Chi," and "Hu" meant, as well as how to do them, but I never played mahjong.</p>
<p>Some people would laugh at me for this, saying, how can you be a modern person if you don't even know how to play mahjong? Mahjong skills are an essential skill in social situations. In their eyes, someone who doesn't know how to play mahjong is simply a modern cripple, not qualified to be a modern person! Besides, some people say: Most writers are enthusiastic gamblers. Cao Juren even discovered a theory of contingent history at the Jai-alai stadium and established his own school of thought! Isn't it a literary joke if someone who writes doesn't know how to play mahjong? Indeed, I'm not keen on being a so-called modern person, nor do I want to be a writer, so mahjong doesn't have to be associated with me.</p>
<p>But I do have an interest in drinking alcohol, that's definitely true.</p>
<p>Five years ago, it could be said that I was at the peak of my drinking days. At that time, the worries of life were strangling my heart, and my fragile heartstrings were so easily moved. At that time, I only felt the need to cry out loud, to roar, but those threads of worry only tightened, tightened even more! At that time, the only way to temporarily forget my sorrows was to drink bowl after bowl of yellow wine. Every night, a packet of peanuts, five or six pieces of dried tofu, and five or six catties of strong, rich Shaoxing wine were divided and poured into the stomachs of two or three of my colleagues! After each catty, everyone's faces were flushed, but mine became even paler. After wild singing and shouting, everyone's shouts for more wine became even more frequent. From then on, my fragile soul became even more fragile, easily moved and easily angered, like the emotions of a woman suffering from hysteria! One night, I was still drinking with two or three colleagues to drown my sorrows, but who knew that as the wine fell into my stomach, tears poured from my eyes. I cried and screamed wildly all night, and my colleagues were helpless.</p>
<p>At that time, I was a famous drunk with a capacity for two catties of alcohol. Whenever there was an opportunity to drink, people would always treat me as someone who could handle two catties of alcohol, so they would keep pouring until I was heavily intoxicated. I myself seemed to always generously perform the idiotic state of a drunken madman. But every time I drank, my painful heart only became more painful. My drinking was not like the elegant act of immortal Li Bai.</p>
<p>Times change, and my old drinking companions have scattered. I myself wander around Shanghai, and the hardships I experience are no less than those of that time. However, the years have taught me year after year, leading me to change from "naive extravagance" to "silent sorrow." Although I sometimes miss the delicious taste of fine wine, I rarely have the extravagant feelings of those years anymore.</p>
<p>In this silent sorrow, I am being urged to grow old day by day.</p>

<h3 id="e172">Hot Springs Park <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Bo</p>
<p>In Sichuan, whether it's in rural villages or cities, there's really nothing to speak of in terms of construction plans. Cultural backwardness means they lack new scientific knowledge, and economic decline means they lack the resources to engage in construction. But everyone who has been to Sichuan will remember one place name – Beibei. This is a new place, the only one in Sichuan built with new methods and scientific planning, specifically for recreation.</p>
<p>Lu Zuofu, formerly the general manager of Minsheng Industrial Company and recently appointed Director of the Sichuan Construction Department, is the founder of Beibei. He spent several years painstakingly decorating it with his personal funds. In a short time, it has become so beautiful.</p>
<p>Beibei – now the collective name for Beibei Town and Hot Springs Park – is located on the south bank of the Jialing River, less than a hundred li from Chongqing. Originally, Beibei was fifteen li away from the hot springs, but since the hot springs were renovated, their names have become intertwined. Now, when people say Beibei, they undoubtedly mean Hot Springs Park.</p>
<p>This time, I was fortunate enough to go to Chongqing and stay for a week. Chongqing is such a dirty and noisy place that if the ropes of life didn't bind people to this city, they certainly wouldn't stay long. So, after staying in Chongqing for three days, one morning I quietly took a steamer with a suitcase and set off for Beibei.</p>
<p>The steamer belongs to Minsheng Company, which also monopolizes the Jialing River route. Every morning at five o'clock, two steamers leave along the Jialing River for Hechuan, returning from Hechuan the next day. Beibei is located between Chongqing and Hechuan.</p>
<p>The boat left very early, before six o'clock. The boat was so crowded and noisy, and the heavy sound of the engine made my head heavy. There were no berths on the boat because the journey was too short, less than a day. So I leaned on the railing, quietly watching the green hills and waves slowly moving behind me.</p>
<p>A middle-aged man experienced in traveling stood beside me unexpectedly. We didn’t depart from the usual polite convention of meeting on a journey, and soon started talking. According to what he told me, the boat we were taking was going upstream; it takes eight or nine hours from Chongqing to Hechuan, but coming back, it only takes five or six hours. "Aren't you going to the hot springs?" he said to me. "I am too. We won't arrive until twelve noon! But when we come back, we'll take the boat leaving from Hechuan at seven in the morning, and we'll arrive in Chongqing after ten."</p>
<p>The water flowed very fast, and sometimes the boat shook violently, like an old man with a fever. There was one place where the boat moved very strangely, making a large "之" (zhi) character on the river, not sailing in the middle of the river. I asked someone, and he said: This is because there are stones under the water, so it has to go around in bends, looking like a dog's crippled leg, so this place is called Dog Leg Bend. The boat cannot sail on Dog Leg Bend; it has to go around it in a "之" character. Every year, many wooden boats are destroyed here, and countless lives are lost.</p>
<p>He pointed out a place to me on the north bank of the river, in a very high mountain recess, where the only railway in all of Sichuan is located. This railway is specifically for transporting coal, and the Minsheng Company's coal plant is located there. I looked up and saw several smoking chimneys on the high mountainside. At this moment, a train was passing on the mountainside, and then disappeared behind another mountain. It looked very small, like a small black snake. My middle-aged companion told me that the Minsheng Company has thirty-some ships, large and small, all using coal produced by its own plant.</p>
<p>The boat arrived at Beibei Town and stopped for a few minutes. Looking from the river, Hot Springs Park was already visible.</p>
<p>Fifteen minutes later, I arrived at Hot Springs Park.</p>
<p>This is a mountain. Looking up, all the houses, sports fields, and orchards are clearly visible. After disembarking, I prepared to face the wide stone steps made of mountain bluestone. There are trees on both sides of the stone steps, especially bamboo. After climbing about two hundred steps, you begin to see the terraces carved out of the mountains by people. I chose a room in a very delicate small Western-style house and began to rest. The room faced the big river, with high mountains on the opposite side and behind. It was named Count Sail Building. This is good; at dusk, counting the sailing boats coming and going on the river is quite poetic.</p>
<p>Afterwards, I began my tour. This Hot Springs Park covers a width of about two li, and its position is exactly halfway up the mountain. There are now many Western-style houses specifically for the convenience of travelers, such as Moon-Viewing Building, Flower-Appreciating Building, and Sunrise Pavilion, which stands tall on the mountaintop but few people climb to. There are many meadows, always with artificial streams and various fruit trees. The hot spring water in the streams is hot. To the east, there is a waterfall cascading down, wrapping around a kudzu vine, with a very beautiful shape. Naturally, the water from this waterfall is also hot.</p>
<p>Later, I hurriedly walked along the cement path towards the public hot spring bath. The bathhouse is divided into rooms and a swimming pool, and the swimming pool is divided into an inner and outer pool. The inner pool only has water up to a person's armpits, but the outer pool can be used to practice diving. As for the private bath rooms, they are specifically for shy ladies and older people; young men rarely want to spend an extra dime to try them (the swimming pool only costs a dime). All the water is brought down from the mountainside through bamboo pipes; the water in both the private bath rooms and the swimming pool is flowing. It flows in freely and flows out freely to a certain limit. And the water temperature is determined by God to be only one degree higher than the average human body temperature.</p>
<p>I paid a dime, and the attendant gave me a pair of blue cloth shorts specially prepared for guests. I changed in the changing room, put on these cloth shorts, and walked down to the inner pool. This pool is very suitable for people like me who can't swim; it won't drown you, and the house covers it so the sun won't tan your white skin. The pool is about twenty yards long and about the same width. The water flows down from a hole in the eastern corner, like a small waterfall. Many people stand under it, letting the rushing water splash countless water droplets on their backs. "This is really a good idea," I thought after looking around. The spring water flows naturally into the inner pool, and when the inner pool is full, it naturally flows into the outer pool, and when the outer pool reaches a certain limit, it flows down the mountain into the Jialing River. This requires no one to look after it.</p>
<p>After the bath, beautiful dusk arrived. At my feet, above my head, in front of me, behind me, and to my left and right, were the sounds of birds returning to the forest. The mountains across the river gradually turned dark green, and a new moon climbed out from the mountain peak behind us.</p>
<p>How can you blame Beibei for being called the "Little Three Gorges"? Look, the mountains on both banks are so high and so steep, and the water is so turbulent; when you walk here, wouldn't you think that the Goddess Peak is right next to you?</p>

<h3 id="e173">Labor Tools <a href="#e173" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c173" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">173</a></h3>
<p>— Jingxing</p>
<p>So-called labor tools are tools used to transmit human labor to act upon natural matter, to overcome natural matter, and to change its shape, function, and so on. In ancient times, there were stone tools, knives, axes, saws, hammers, and in modern times, there are complex and massive machines that have been improved and developed. Although labor tools are already completed, artificially transformed, dead matter, these things contain extremely large effects and social significance for humans and a given society. Although some modern sociologists use the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age to divide social eras, it is inevitably narrow and not entirely appropriate, but from this, we can see the importance of the position of labor tools in the process of human social life.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, labor tools are not only a bridge for the exchange between humans and natural matter but also a manifestation of the civilization or barbarity of people and their social life. When considering a single, individual labor tool as the object of investigation, it is certainly still a completed, artificially transformed, dead material mass, a solidified product of labor, but if many individual labor tools are linked together for a historical examination, then this thing itself exhibits a kind of vitality, a kind of evolutionary life's inherent continuous movement, even embodying the evolutionary movement of humans and their society.</p>
<p>The human body is a living organic entity; as for labor tools, no matter how much they contain human labor within them, in the end, they are still just dead inorganic matter (excluding cattle, horses, and livestock, of course), two completely different kinds of things. However, the fact is very interesting: the latter, inorganic material labor tools, can replace the physiological evolution of the former, organic human beings. Because labor tools are, in fact, simply extensions and transformations of human organs, the improvement and evolution of labor tools can replace the improvement and progress of human organs. For example, according to human needs, we must be able to see the vast sky and observe microorganisms smaller than the tip of an autumn hair, so human eyes need to be greatly improved. At least they should be like cat's eyes, with extremely large contractile variability in their pupils. However, humans, because of the invention of telescopes and microscopes, have these labor tools to replace the improving function of the naked eye, so even if our eyes do not undergo such major changes, we can see extremely distant celestial bodies and observe material particles and microorganisms invisible to the naked eye. Pincers are the transformation of fingers; they replace the function of pulling nails by hand. Saw teeth are the transformation of teeth; they also replace the function of cutting things with teeth. Rakes are the transformation of fingernails; they also replace the function of grabbing things with fingernails. So, with pliers, saws, and rakes, there is no longer a need for developed fingers, sharp teeth, or sharp claws. This is proof that labor tools have replaced the improvement and progress of physiological organs. Thus, all labor tools are merely extensions, transformations, and diversification and complexity of human organs outside the body.</p>
<p>Labor tools replacing the evolution of human physiological organs is only one aspect of their function. On the other hand, they can also change human physiological organization; people create labor tools, and labor tools can then come back and transform people. Because the human body organization, in the continuous change of labor tools, must adapt to this change to change itself. For example, if someone asks why humans don't grow tiger or leopard-like sharp claws, then we say that humans, because of the invention of pliers and rakes, not only don't need such claws, but according to Lamarck's theory of use and disuse, they will naturally degenerate because pliers and rakes have replaced their function, and furthermore, having them would restrict the function of gripping things and doing other things. Also, if someone asks why human brains are particularly developed, then we say it is because humans have various labor tools, making our labor work, methods, processes, and even labor objects complex and vast, so the brain, in this complex labor life, cannot adapt to this life without gradually changing everything about itself. From this, it can be seen that labor tools are also constantly transforming human natural organs and bodies. The evolution of labor tools, on the natural part of human beings, represents him as being savage or civilized, also pushes human nature from savagery to the realm of civilization, away from the animal stage.</p>
<p>The fact that labor tools represent the evolution of human beings themselves is certainly obvious, but it is not as obvious as the fact that labor tools represent the evolution of social culture. Because human labor itself, no matter how great its use value, how great its ability to control nature, must be mediated by labor tools to reach the point of applying its labor to the external world and conquering and utilizing nature on a large scale according to its needs and purposes, in order to transfer and transmit it in the past, thereby changing natural objects. Therefore, labor tools are the medium for the transfer of the use value of human labor, the tool for transmitting labor. With them, humans can widely use external matter to improve their lives, to build a rich social material, that is, to enrich the social economic life. However, the material economic life of society is certainly the culture of society, and the richness of all spiritual life, the improvement and evolution of all cultural relics and systems, are based on the changes in the most basic economic life. Therefore, the evolutionary stage of the overall culture of society, the civilization or barbarity of society, just like the civilization or savagery, progress or backwardness of human natural bodies themselves, can be expressed by the degree of diversity, complexity, refinement, and crudeness of labor tools. If labor tools are rudimentary and simple, then the economic life of this society will inevitably be very crude and simple, and all social culture will be equally backward. Conversely, then society will have evolved to a high degree of civilization. We only need to observe that the primitive era used stone tools as labor tools, becoming savages and savage social life and culture, and that modern labor tools have developed to extreme complexity and diversity, and modern social culture has also advanced to a very complex height, to understand this.</p>
<p>The improvement, progress, and complexity of labor tools not only can simply transfer labor and its use value but also enable the action of human labor to extend to a wider range of natural objects, to control a wider range of natural objects, and even to enhance human labor efficiency. Therefore, using stone tools not only cannot subdue the power of water and electricity in the universe for human use, but also using stone tools to fell a tree would require a lot of labor and time. This means that using bad labor tools limits the production capacity greatly, and the progress of labor tools represents the development process of social productive forces. The more backward labor tools are, the smaller human production capacity is. The more advanced labor tools are, the stronger human productive forces are. The development of productive forces is determined by the degree of improvement of labor tools. However, the development of productive forces determines all the development processes of society, so the evolution of labor tools can also determine and represent the general development of social culture here.</p>
<p>As for the relationship between people, strictly speaking, the determining role of labor tools also participates in it. Because the formation of human society lies in the need for labor production, and especially the existence of social public labor tools, in order to carry out social production. People's own organs are the personal property of individuals and cannot be made public for social use. Others cannot use my hands and feet to hit people or walk for themselves. Only the extra-corporeal organs that are the social products that are separate from personal ownership can be used in common. Therefore, the social relationship of collective human labor is promoted by the common use of labor tools. Without common, usable labor tools, there can be no common labor, social production cannot be established, and human relationships cannot be linked together. Not only that, if you examine that the use of stone tools cannot produce more products than personal life requires, the exploitation of slavery cannot occur, and how the emergence of modern large-scale mechanical industrial system necessarily requires the free labor buying and selling methods of the wage system, and the various social relations produced thereby, then you can know that the changes in labor tools also cause human relationships to constantly undergo corresponding changes. In short, labor tools not only become a symbol of the civilization and evolution of natural human beings but also become an indicator of the progress of social civilization. They determine the degree of development of social productive forces and also become a determining factor in the generation and change of human relationships themselves.</p>

<h3 id="e174">Please Don't Worry About Me Limping Around Looking For A Job <a href="#e174" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c174" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">174</a></h3>
<p>— Wu Hesheng</p>
<p>I am the most painful person in the world because my life is flawed. Early on, I lost the ability to move part of my leg. At the same time, I have encountered the most difficult hurdle in the world because I am unemployed, and it has been almost half a year.</p>
<p>Although I am disabled, I have done a lot of things: After my father sent me to a Shanghai cigarette paper store to learn the trade, I then entered a woodworking shop and a shoe store as a shop assistant; I served as an accountant and manager in stationery companies and wineries; I worked as a copyist, draftsman, and mimeographer in cultural institutions... Naturally, I have gone through many difficult hurdles in the process. Each time I was unemployed and changed jobs, I was always threatened by life. However, I always took heavy steps, buried my head with a resolute heart, like Wu Zixu passing through the checkpoints, breaking through one after another. I even congratulated myself on breaking out of the circle of small apprentices and gradually climbing to the office of a high-level cultural institution! Who would have thought that I would be unemployed again! It turns out that the higher you climb (?), the harder you fall!</p>
<p>Once unemployed in Shanghai, I have been busy with this matter every day, asking people to help me find something to do in the east and asking people to help me find work in the west. What is the result of asking people? "There are too many unemployed people now, not to mention someone who is limping like you!" "They all say they don't want someone who is limping because it is unsightly!" People use these words to answer me, with a hint of resentment in their tone that I shouldn't have bothered them to suffer such humiliation on my behalf. I naturally have nothing to say; therefore, there has never been a success.</p>
<p>There are many unemployed people, I think that's right. No one can avoid this in today's society. But why say "not to mention someone who is limping like you"? And why say "it is unsightly"? Does my limping mean that I can't do things? Is it because I am "limping" and offend the sight of the adults and gentlemen that I don't have the right to look for a job in this world? God! What kind of world is this? Does that mean I am only worthy of a dead end with no job forever? Does my limping mean that I don't even have the hope of survival?</p>
<p>Resentment is your resentment, I will do it myself, because this world is a snobbish world. If you have money and power, then even if you are limping or paralyzed all over, it doesn't matter. People might even admire you. Basically, it is because I was born with a bad life (if you say there is fate), I have no money, let alone power, and my limping does not receive people's welcome, but instead incurs hatred, which is inevitable.</p>
<p>But, is this world only filled with snobbish worshippers? I don't believe it! I don't believe it! I believe I can live on, I believe that those friends who see the truth through snobbery will sympathize with me! Pity me!</p>
<p>Respected friends! Are you willing to let my life be destroyed in front of you? Give me work! I can still work, and I can still help you complete your work.</p>
<p>P.S.: No matter what kind of work, I am willing to do it well with my enthusiasm and my strength (I can handle jobs such as hawker, apprentice, shop assistant, copyist, steel pen, mimeograph, drawing advertisements, drawing patterns, etc. in cultural institutions). Please don't worry about me limping around. Five li is okay. My body is very healthy, and I can also handle labor work. I have no various hobbies. Finally, naturally, I don't care about the salary, I only ask for room and board.</p>

<h3 id="e175">On Intellectuals <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Heng</p>
<p>Due to the determination of living conditions, intellectuals cannot become an independent group of people: every intellectual is subordinate to or close to a certain independent group of people. Conversely, it can also be said that every independent group of people has its spokespersons in various aspects (such as politics, philosophy (literature))—intellectuals; the so-called intellectuals generally, that is, the scholars we called in the past, refer to the spokespersons or sympathizers of a certain independent group of people. Therefore, it is usually incorrect for people to call intellectuals the intellectual class. In fact, Confucius and Mencius, as well as Yang Zhu and Mo Di, were all scholars, but we cannot say that they were the same group; Zeng Guofan and Liang Qichao, Lin Qinnan and Hu Shi were also intellectuals, but we cannot say that they were one group.</p>
<p>Because every independent group of people has its intellectuals, the social movements led by them will inevitably have intellectuals participating. Intellectuals naturally cannot lead a social movement alone, complete a great historical mission, but without them, no social movement will happen, develop, or be completed. If the "May Fourth" Movement did not have Chen Duxiu and Hu Shi, there would naturally be other intellectuals to replace their duties, but if there were no intellectuals participating at all (this assumption will certainly not become a reality), then the occurrence of the "May Fourth" Movement would probably also be a big problem. "Scholars rebel, it won't be successful in three years," but without "scholars," even if someone wants to rebel, they won't be able to. Song Jiang, known as the Timely Rain, was famous all over the world, but without the "lazy scholar" Wu Yong, his position as the first leader in Liangshan Village would probably be unstable; Liu Bei was handsome, but without Zhuge Liang, whose Daoist name was Crouching Dragon, he probably wouldn't be able to claim himself emperor in Shu; Zhang Liang, Chen Ping, and other intellectuals contributed greatly to the Han Gaozu's gaining of the empire; the success of King Wu's conquest of Zhou, his so-called "ten rebellious ministers" also made great contributions; all of these are sufficient to fully demonstrate the social role of intellectuals. Therefore, although intellectuals are detached and cannot play an independent role, we cannot underestimate them and say that they are useless because of this; the saying "scholars are useless in everything" does not correspond to objective facts.</p>
<p>Intellectuals are detached; they can climb up or fall down. They can enter the conservative camp and work hard to turn back the clock, but they can also become members of a progressive group and promote historical progress. In history, there are naturally many intellectuals who serve as slaves to evil people, betray themselves and harm others, and endanger the country and society, but as history progresses, it is not impossible to find scholars who are not moved by the oppression of authority and the temptation of money and who are always faithful to objective truth. Therefore, we cannot, because we see a few opportunistic "sell-out" scholars in history, affirm that "scholars have no integrity," and say that all intellectuals are the most unreliable, opportunistic, and evil people!</p>
<p>At the same time, every social movement that occurs must have its objective social conditions. As for intellectuals participating in or representing a certain group to lead a progressive social movement, it is because they have recognized the trend of social development and change in their social life, and recognized the significance of the social movement that is happening or about to happen at that time, and it is not because they want to fight for some status for all intellectuals that they do so. In fact, every progressive social movement, although many intellectuals can recognize its significance and participate in it, at the same time, some intellectuals fail to recognize its significance and express their opposition. For example, the Northern Expedition of the National Revolution was participated in by many intellectuals, but also opposed by many intellectuals. If intellectuals are regarded as an independent group, and it is said that their participation in a...</p>
<p>Continued on page 5</p>

<h2>Page 23</h2>
<p>...competing for status, and thus evaluate the participation of intellectuals in social movements with a purely "selfish" attitude, completely negating the role of intellectuals and even their personality, then how should the above-mentioned events be explained? Here, I hope that people who despise intellectuals will use their brains a little more!</p>
<p>Of course, even among the intellectuals who participate in progressive social movements, there are some who climb up by taking advantage of the development of the movement; after they climb up or when they want to climb up, they often use regressive behavior to obtain their personal and realistic interests. However, even so, we cannot deny the significance of the movement, nor can we deny the achievements of the intellectuals who participated in the movement; it is wrong to deny the significance of the movement because some intellectuals who participated in the progressive social movement "sell themselves out" midway or later, or to oppose the movement and the intellectuals who participated in the movement because of this, saying that although the movement is meaningful, the intellectuals who participated in the movement cannot be evaluated in the same way as the significance of the movement. We know that the significance of a progressive social movement exists objectively and will never disappear because a few people participate and then "sell themselves out" later. For example, some of the intellectuals who participated in the Xinhai Revolution later went on to support Yuan Shikai as emperor, but history will not fail to record the objective significance of the Xinhai Revolution because of this. At the same time, before we evaluate an event, we should base it on the objective effects of the event, not on our own subjective guesses. If an intellectual has participated in a certain progressive social movement, then even if he retreats midway or later, history will truthfully record his participation in that social movement, and will evaluate its significance in the same way as the significance of that movement; because the objective effect of his efforts when he participated in that movement is beneficial to the development of the movement, and will never disappear because of his retreat midway or later, just as his participation in that progressive social movement cannot conceal his retreat midway or later. Take Dr. Hu Shi as an example. In the "May Fourth" Literary Revolution, he was progressive, and he made great contributions to the New Culture Movement at that time. Now, he is still obsessed with the cultural relics and systems of the gold and yuan dynasties and has long been outdated, but...cannot...publicly deny his past achievements, nor can...cover up his current...outdatedness because of his past achievements. Therefore, it is unfair and erroneous for people to rely on their own subjective guesses and say that the motives of an intellectual who once participated in a progressive social movement were impure when he participated in the movement, thereby denying the significance of his participation in the movement, and even saying that the movement itself is problematic.</p>
<p>I think that intellectuals are detached, their will is relatively weak, they lack courage and魄力, they can speak and think, but they lack the spirit of practical work, so they themselves have many shortcomings. We should not nitpick and excessively鞭打 them, but should guide them to serve the country and society well. If they have shortcomings and mistakes, we should naturally point them out to make them pay attention, but we cannot deny their active role. Of course, those intellectuals who consciously work hard to turn back the clock, live a decadent and depraved life, and engage in activities that betray themselves and harm others cannot be forgiven by history, nor can we compromise with them; what we should guide are general intellectuals, not such people.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Small Vendors <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Chenxi</p>
<p>The situation in Changchun, in addition to the relatively strong capitalist atmosphere here, is similar to many large cities I have seen in Guannei in some places. All the magnificent appearances that large cities have are also available here, and the most surprising thing is the large number of opium dens and smokers everywhere.</p>
<p>It is said that there are more than 50 opium dens here, and no less than hundreds of thousands of people rely on them directly or indirectly to make a living; in addition, there are more than 100 "small vendors" attached to the front of the opium dens. Although opium is also "banned through taxation" here and has a special sales office, it is not easy for an outsider who has just arrived here to eat it: eating opium here has a certain occasion, similar to the "Yu Li" in Shanghai, and strangers cannot inquire about it.</p>
<p>Opening an opium den here also requires a lot of expenses, just like in Shanghai: donations to the Special Sales Office, "black sales" for inspections and detectives, "filial piety" for gangsters and street politicians, and you have to spend money everywhere to make the business smooth and profitable. However, the miscellaneous expenses spent by the opium den owners are not entirely unrecoverable: for example, the general vendors and merchants in the "small vendors" attached to the front of the opium dens are the targets of the opium den owners' money. Speaking of these vendors in the "small vendors," although they themselves do not necessarily smoke opium, they have to rely on "opium smoking" to make a living all day long: because most of the opium smokers who go to the opium dens to smoke have a "口嬌" (jiao: particular about taste) problem, and they like to eat a little bit of fresh things to change their taste, so the general vendors have to pick up a little bit of residue under the opium smokers' lip service.</p>
<p>Although the "small vendor" is small, it is not inferior to a fair: there are exquisite "eight-treasure porridge," "original soup noodles," "delicious wontons," "finely ground almond tea," and also "smoked beef," "夹烫面火烧" (baked wheaten cake filled with hot noodles), "fruit," "candy," "cigarettes," etc., probably dozens of kinds. Just hearing those exquisite terms, we can't help but salivate, let alone those opium smokers who have a "口嬌" problem?</p>
<p>The situation in front of the opium dens is completely different in the morning and afternoon. The patrons of opium smokers from government offices are usually around 8 o'clock. As for those who come successively after 10 o'clock, most of them are gentlemen of the leisurely upper class and business owners. Therefore, the situation in front of the small vendors also differs in the morning and afternoon. Around 10 o'clock, opium smokers consider it to be the dawn of light, and they have their own preferences in the selection of things at this time. Meat and greasy food are of course not suitable for consumption, and noodles with too much soup are a bit bloated; what should be eaten at this time must be exquisite dim sum. Therefore, in front of the "small vendors" in the early morning, you rarely see担挑 (portable stands) of "wontons," "hanging noodles," or even "eight-treasure porridge": but is business cold? No! The "口嬌" opium smokers are the benefactors who support the vendors: "Hey, give me a bowl of almond tea, shopkeeper!" Opium smokers are mostly good at dealing with the world. Even to a vendor, they are willing to speak in a gentle tone. They all have a successful eloquence, which is trained in the high-level talks by the opium lamp, especially for ordinary greetings: "Hey, is the漿 (soybean milk) hot? Bring two fried dough sticks, shopkeeper!" "Yes, you are! The almond tea is here, the漿 is hot, look, the freshly fried dough sticks!" Is the front of the small vendors in the early morning cold? No, it won't be cold. The small vendors do business at the same time as the opium dens; from early morning to dusk, to late at night, opium dens are constantly patronized by opium smokers, and what about the vendors in front of the door? They are also constantly doing business with those general "口嬌" opium smokers. However, with the different times, their food also has to be changed: almond tea, soy milk, these businesses are the busiest in front of the small vendors in the early morning. When the sun rises high, these owners are washing the pots and bowls. Stalls of "sauce meat," "烧饼 (baked sesame flatbread)," "cigarettes," and "fresh fruit" are also preparing to take over. The "口嬌" opium smokers do not eat too much at noon. The five-cent sauce meat is cut into "knife pieces" and the 烧饼 must be freshly baked. Five cents of meat can be sandwiched between two 烧饼. At this time, in front of the small vendors, you can no longer see the steaming漿 stands and almond tea担挑 in the early morning, but the sound of the grinding rod in the baked food shop, the light of the knife cutting sauce meat, and the conversations of pedestrians are intertwined in front of the small vendors with a雑音调 (mixed tone). In addition, with the shouting of the fruit vendors and the paper candy shop owners next to it, the scenery in front of the small vendors at noon also shows that the small vendor industry that has benefited from the light of opium smokers and opium dens is by no means covered in the wave of recession and depression. When the moment of noon has passed, and the sun is gradually a little slanting, the bustling is followed by a deathly silence; at this time, the number of opium smokers in the opium dens has also decreased; the general office workers have to go to work after talking for about an hour because they have official business. Most of those who remain in the opium dens at this time are the idle class and some businessmen; they occupy a few opium beds sporadically, lying down with their eyes squinted, as if they were propping up the scene for the opium dens for two or three hours. At four or five o'clock in the afternoon, the opium dens began to come to the most brilliant stage of their business of the day; the opium smokers who had worked hard during the day were using nightlife to adjust their spirits at this time; the scene in front of the "small vendors" was replaced by a bustling scene again.</p>
<p>"Wontons are boiling!"</p>
<p>"Eight-treasure porridge! Hot!" This knife-like sharp shout penetrates the tired bodies and minds of the opium smokers, and their emotions suddenly resemble learning a strike; just about to step into the opium den, they will immediately slap themselves back, as if remembering something: "Oh! I'm hungry, let's eat something before smoking opium?"</p>
<p>The roar of the vendors is a very powerful hint: opium smokers are never easily let go when they pass in front of them.</p>

<p>"Dare I? Director Bian is very serious about official affairs, and everyone knows he is iron-faced and selfless." He quietly glanced at me twice, and added two sentences: "Yuan Tai feels that the enemy is evading taxes, and he must be dealt with severely. There are also small distilleries that are naughty. It's rare for the director to come out in person, and he must heal them!"</p>
<p>I almost couldn't help laughing. He patted me again and again, making me both satiated and painful, yet comfortable, and uncomfortable, but I loved this kind of taste, and I was happy with him. In fact, this kid has a talking mouth, a clever mind, and a good face. It's just that his heart is too bad: he calculates others. Honestly, if I hadn't been running errands in the official field for a few years, I might still suffer from him! But then again, his bad intentions hit my heart: several times of financial joy were with his help, and several times of stiff things were relied on him to turn around. So I look up to him and took him along again today. Really, although my appearance is great, I have to cherish talents; for example, just now I was annoyed with him, nothing more than deliberately calculating me, in fact, this is also driven by self-esteem, as long as this bit of stupid energy passes, I will not discuss today's problems with him!

<p>Production cost of one million pounds sterling</p>
<p>British London Films, formerly had several famous productions, such as "The Private Life of Henry VIII," "Catherine the Great," and "The Scarlet Pimpernel," when it was shown in China, they were all a sensation. At that time, the company had two giants: one was Alexander Korda. One is L. Toeplitz, but Toeplitz later broke away from London and formed his own Toeplitz Production Company. He was originally a great British millionaire, and there was no problem with his financial situation. His aim is to produce only four or six films a year, but each one is a blockbuster. The first one cost one million pounds to produce "The Loves of Madame Dubarry" (the film has arrived in Shanghai and will be released in Shanghai soon). He specially invited the great director Victor Saville to take on the director's work for this film, and also recruited Hollywood star Kraft Brock and British red star Marlene Carol to play the leading roles in the film. Therefore, after the premiere, it has won excellent reader praise in Europe and the United States, and it is expected that the harvest in Shanghai in the future will not be inferior to a "The Private Life of Henry VIII" and other films, and it is heard that Hollywood's Sheverlay has also been hired by Toeplitz, and the second product is to invite him to play the leading role, which is indeed a good phenomenon on the British silver scene!</p>
<h3 id="e180">The Detective's Filming Record <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>——A Joke on the Set——</p>
<p>The detective Wang Weixin in "Emerald Horse" is very diligent in the case of drug prohibition and is always planning ways to crack it. As long as he gets a clue, he immediately leads the team to set off.</p>
<p>On this day, the detective Wang Weixin found out that there were a large number of drug dealers transporting drugs on the霹天 (Pitian) set of the Star Company, so he hurried with his brothers, armed with weapons, from the dressing room, straight to the photography set. On this day, the reporter happened to be on the scene. The situation of the two sides fighting with weapons, tense and terrifying, how can we not record it.</p>
<p>It is said that the director Xu Xinfu, who instigated the two sides to fight, stood high on the Zhang Fang table and shouted loudly: "Ready! Kill!"</p>
<p>So Lao Wang got on the Public Security Bureau's truck (naturally fake), and the drug transporters also got on the truck carrying drugs. The two sides opened up their horsepower and rushed straight towards each other. The detective saw the drug dealers' car was not far in front of him, and hurriedly stopped the truck horizontally in the center of the road, blocking the drug dealers' way. At the same time, he opened fire. The drug transporters, seeing this situation, were unwilling to show weakness and fired back. So the good show began, the sound of "啪" (pa) rose up, the situation suddenly became tense, and it was chilling. The detective's gun pointed at the drug dealers and prepared to shoot, but he knew that a Miss standing behind a certain drug dealer watching the filming was startled by this situation and ran away, as if a real bullet was about to fall on her, causing everyone to laugh. As a result of this battle, the "Old Gun" was eaten and abandoned the car. Fortunately, the director Xu Xinfu shouted loudly to stop the poor enemy from pursuing, and the good show ended here.</p>
<p>The reporter stepped forward, shook Lao Wang's hand, and praised his wonderful marksmanship. Lao Wang said with some apologies: "Where, where, no one is afraid of my wooden-shell gun!"</p>
<p>"Wasn't the Miss just now made to be frightened by you?"</p>
<p>Lao Wang couldn't help laughing and told me: "The expressions of the visitors to the many photography sets are often more profound than the actors. Their expressions are often more profound than the actors. When the actors laugh in front of the camera, they also laugh. When the actors cry in front of the camera, they also cry. Just now, I noticed your expression, which was more profound than that of the Miss!"</p>
<p>After being said this by him, the reporter became a little embarrassed and slipped out of the photography set without looking back, secretly admiring that the detective was indeed a great detective, not only was his marksmanship wonderful, but also his eyes were quick and his hands were quick, and even the expressions of the visitors could not escape his sharp eyes.</p>
