<h3>英國在世界市塲的近勢</h3>
<p>— 華</p>
<p>最近倫敦「金融新聞」發表本年上半年英國對外貿易的總結算。其中有數點事實。足供注意英國外交動向者的參考。第一。本年上半年英國對外貿易的總價值。比較一九三四和三三年的同時期。都見增加。其中英國本部與屬頒間的貿易。輸入和輸出均有增加。英國與其他各國的貿易。輸入减少。而輸出捎增。第二。本年上半年英國輸出在世界市場各方面的分配。在非洲增加最多。在歐洲。對於北歐的英鎊集團國家和德國波蘭都增加。而對於荷蘭。法國瑞士及意大利等金本位國家則减少在亞洲對日輸出增加對華减少在南美。對於阿根廷智利和可侖比亞都增加對於巴西秘魯和烏拉圭則都减少。</p>
<p>從上述的結果。我們可以看出。近年來英國所施行的帝國貿易團結的政策巳獲得相當的成功但英國輸出品在世界市塲上的鬥爭則得失互見沒有收到全盤的勝利。目前在世界市塲上與英國爭勝的。為美國與日本。尤其以大阪和蘭開夏在棉織品的輸出競爭上。幾有不能兩立之勢。英國棉織品本來以非洲。亞洲和拉丁美洲為主要的市塲。但近年來日本棉織品以廉價的傾銷向各方挺進。漸使蘭開夏出品感受嚴重的威脅。英國以盡力的掙扎。總算保持了非洲市塲上原有的優勢。但在亞洲和南美。則日貨的傾銷已有不可阻遏之勢。英國對日輸出。雖以大量的機器。金屬原料及軍需品。而顯示增加。對華輸出則不免因棉織品市塲的被奪。而漸見减色了。</p>
<p>據八月三十日上海日文報所載。七月份各國對華的棉織品輸出。日本已佔首位。英國屈居第二。在中國整個的棉織品市塲上。日本佔百分之五二·三九。英國佔百分之四零·八二。其餘百分之六·七九屬於第三者。英貨的銷路似乎漸漸集中於上海一隅。而日貨則在各方面都有猛進之勢。　英國派遣來華的財政專家羅斯爵士。目前正在東京。與日本當道接洽談判據說市塲問題也是要談到的事項之一那麽上面的報告當是應時的參考資料了。英日在世界　塲己造成對壘的形勢。在目前的談判中這個市塲問題究竟是促成妥恊的因棄。抑將為引起破裂的障璧。確是值得深思的。</p>

<p>（華盛頓）美國商部官員今日告美聯社記者、稱美國輸往中國之出口貨、將維持現在之水平、以待中國內部情形之轉佳、中國之經濟恐慌由於美國銀政策及國內財政之紛亂及水災所致、今年前六個月內、美國輸入之華貨較去年同時期增加百分之二十六、但輸入中國之美貨則减少百分之四〇·三、白銀專家之預測適得其反云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<h3>地中海一帶　英意海軍活動　香港二艦亦升火待發</h3>
<p>（羅馬）意國軍艦刻正在瑪爾太附近從事操練、英國亦在地中海從事海上軍備、意國已爲大起恐慌、而爲殖民部喉舌之殖民日報載稱、英國已以海軍九分隊加入地中海艦隊、英戍軍亦經大增、各口岸之攻勢守勢工程、無一不修繕完固直布羅陀·瑪爾太·居比路·哈法·亞歷山特里亞數處之根據、皆已作攻守之準備、其武器已臻開始脅迫地中海與組海意軍地位之程度英海軍支隊每抵吾人海面、吾人輒須作對抗之佈置、若英國內國艦隊調至吾人海濱、則意國之對抗佈置將益嚴重云、（十四日路透電）</p>

<h3>五國委員會　建議內容推測　予意國以政治經濟權利　無人信墨索里尼能接受</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）聞五國特委會將繼續工作至本星期杪、以期於下星期一日或星期二夜完成報告書、提交意阿雙方、此間現無一人敢料墨索里尼將接受巴黎之建議者、墨氏已拒絕此項建議之廣大範圍但特　會之報告書、聞仍將以巴黎建議為根據、日內瓦各界因國聯今可脫離其成立歷史中最大之難關、各國將立於共同陣綫、以對付侵略國、皆為歡忭不置、波蘭代表貝克輿土耳其代表阿拉斯、均為特委會之委員、因所處地位、殊難發言、已均允不在國聯大會演說（十四日路透社電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）五國委員會今日會議兩次、討論意　爭議、特委會目下顯正從事將巴黎三國會議之全部建議、重定其型式、以期覓得易為意國接受之基礎、且或將於對法與對英之保障一事規定若干讓與權、但决無損及阿國主權與政治獨立之任何讓與權問題、英國政界切實聲稱、受託統治一節、實不成問題、蓋代治之見解、在根本上實與國聯會員身分相背也、特委會、報告書將提交國聯、而非英法兩國、國聯行政院將據以作最後調解努力、於是報告書將送致意阿雙方、如經意國拒絕、則行政院除進行國聯盟約第十五條外、別無他法、按照第十五條、應委派調查委員會提出解决爭議之建議、若仍不由雙方接受、則將趨入制裁之一途、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）據時報駐日內瓦訪員探悉、五國委員會大約將給予意國以一種新保障、俾意國在阿比西尼亞佔有經濟及政治之優勢、其辦法則係採取委任統治制度、與英國在伊拉克之地位相類似、但此種提義、在國聯會行政院本屆會議閉會前、能否由意國代表阿洛西加以答復、則尚為一疑問、竟國內閣現定於九月十四日舉行會議、一切要當視羅馬方面之態度而定云、又時報駐羅馬訪員則稱、意國政府已準備考慮此項提議、但以為意阿兩國關係、不能與目前伊拉克所處　位相提並論、無論何種辦法、倘須憑籍阿國之良善意志以執行、則意國均當加以拒絕、意國政府方面並以為阿皇雖可聽其保全皇位、然意國就政治及軍事上控制阿國、則屬必要之舉云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）國聯會行政院五國委員會閒曾建議、意國得在經濟政治上佔優勢、俾該國在阿比西尼亞所處地位能與英國在伊拉克國所處地位相類似、此問各報對於此項建議紛紛加以評論、工黨機關報每日民聲報載稱、阿比西尼亞當以土地讓予意國、而由英法兩國弁所屬之索謀里　出一地給予阿國、作為通海道路以資抵償泰晤士報則謂、法國所屬索謀里蘭之直布地港將成為自由港、作為阿國通海之用、又謂現有一種建議、主張組織集體委任統治制、而由意國參加、至可詫異則、此制當逐漸演進、直至阿國成為意大利之保護國而後已耳、英國代表對於時局之淮展、現正密切注意、幷準備隨時出而干涉、俾樹立集體委任制與犧牲阿國主權、二者之間、劃一鴻溝、以資區別云云、（十四日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（羅馬）民報頃登載評論、略謂「解决人口過剩僅有三種方法、一則將目前各女殖民國所佔有之富源重行作適宜之分配、二則佔領目前尚未有人佔頒之殖民地、三則向目前之殖民國家從事戰爭、第一法英國外相霍爾在國聯會大會演說時曾有所提及、吾人自不妨加以考慮、然霍爾之意、殆以為意大利其安心靜待乎、第二法卽係意國目前所採取者、不圖竟因此觸英國之怒此兩法倘行不通、則自然祇有採取第三法、卽向殖民國家從事戰爭、以獲取富源是也」云云、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）官塲方面對於日內瓦玉國委員會所進行之和解程序、能否獲得成功仍表示懷疑、以為意國抱有三種志願、（一）意屬東菲殖民地之安全、（二）意國領土的經濟的人口的向外擴張、（三）此種擴張之武力保護、該委員會之提議能否與意國此種志願相符、殊屬可疑、倘依照伊拉克之制度、以謀解决、則必先將上述意國之志願予以滿足、方能為意國所接受、抑伊拉克現行制度、係在英國與伊拉克完全友好之環境中所訂立、此則與目前意阿關係、逈乎不同云、最後一層、其用意殆以為意國有充分理由、可在阿比西尼亞自由行使其任務也、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<h3>南菲代表警吿　全菲黑人恐將一致奮起</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）南菲代表狄華泰今日向國聯大會之演說亦頗足重視、據稱、南菲為菲洲之一部、故對意阿爭執特別關切、並發警告稱、征服之戰爭必有一日自食其最嚴重之結果、蓋菲洲各處勢將風起雲湧、以抗此類罪惡、此則昔之野蠻主義勢必再見於今日矣、黑洲人民必以和平之道教之獨立、而不當強之以力、此為國聯代管之原則、東菲戰事一旦爆發則此制度勢將完全瓦解、一大國之大人物已將內政整頓完成、將冒天下之大不韙乎、因本此希望、向新意大利及其當局呼籲、並信歐洲必仍有政治家深知時機之迫切、而使歐洲復返於眞理之路也云、（十三日國民電）</p>

<h3>法外長之演說　各方觀感各異　美方謂足增弭戰希望</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）國務總理赫爾今日聲稱、彼僅讀法總理賴伐爾向國聯大會演說之撮要、惟對於該項之演說及日內瓦方面之和平精神、甚感愉快、彼認賴氏之演說、已調和全世界之和平情緒、並增加挽回戰事之希望云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間某要人批評法總理賴伐爾在國聯大會中所發贊成英國態度維護盟約之言輪、謂此乃法國慷概公正之論調　些言論察之、英外相霍爾似已向賴伐爾保障歐洲任何地方苟有侵略者、英國必贊成制裁以應付之、渠信賴伐爾現仍努力與墨索里尼談話、以勸其改變態度云、近來此間有兩種消息、一謂五人特委會現擬提出辦法、授意國以實際上施諸阿國之代管權、並擔保其經濟上與政治上之優越地位、又一消息謂賴伐爾現正力勸英國依允給諸墨索里尼之讓　權、俾墨氏可中止其對阿戰爭、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今晨英國各報從各種觀察點熱切歡迎賴伐爾昨日在國聯大會所發之言論、泰晤士報稱、賴伐爾與霍爾二人之言論、已增大國聯之權威、而提高歐洲安全之觀念墨索里尼當知合作則所獲較任性孤行為多也、晨郵報謂賴伐爾與霍爾不能表示矛盾意見、但環境　否許其意見見諸實施、則猶堪疑問、每日電聞謂賴伐爾之言、乃一種明白警告、表明法國不徒為岡聯消極會員、每日驊報謂墨索里尼如再堅持其現有態度、則全世界將羣起而攻之、此與意國及墨氏政治皆有不利、每日郵報謂賴伐爾未直接言及制裁、其目的殆欲避免制裁、彙聞報謂賴伐爾已使法國受有拘束、若欲食言、必貽國家之羞、獨每日快報則作悲觀論調、謂賴伐爾之言輪、不啻表示國聯已死、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>羅斯福總統　贊助赫爾宣言　惟美國並不因此牽入漩渦</h3>
<p>美國海特派克　羅斯福總統今日核准國務總理赫爾對於意阿爭端之宣言、認其為目今美國對於此事之唯一表示、或以赫爾宣言中之涵義就詢、總統答稱、該宣言並無美國將趨向戰爭之意、如遇戰事、則自當通過具體法律應付之云、又問何種軍火在禁運之列、總統稱、彼正研究全部問題云、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）羅總統對於時局、深為系念、與新聞記者晤談時、羅總統答記者之問話、謂海外果一旦發生戰事、美國必守中立、新近立法案已造成六個月中立之時期、並禁止軍火輸往交戰國云、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）舉國咸認國務總理赫爾對於意阿爭議之宣言為非正式援引凱洛非戰公約、而以促進法國之行動為宗旨、並聞法外長賴伐蘭發表官言之前、赫爾鑒於日內瓦之趨勢大為震驚、認為歐戰後最嚴重之危機、參議員麥加度發表批評稱、美國對於意阿爭議之和解、無能為力、干涉政策不僅勞而無功、月將牽入漩渦云參議員金氏則表示凱洛非戰公約似己壽終正寢、該約簽字國能否鼓起勇氣召開會議、甚為可疑也（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（紐約）紐約時報批評法總理賴伐爾昨在日內瓦所發之言論、謂國聯會員國將聯合抵抗意國所佈置之戰爭、已可由此見之、墨索里尼對此將如何乎、墨氏機關報咸謂縱導成對英戰爭、墨氏亦不停止其對阿動作、果爾、則歐洲或將不得已而與神經錯亂陷入危境之狄克推多相周旋矣云、紐約時報並謂以法國之代表而作如此肯定嚴峻之言論、實非始料所及云、同時紐約通報則謂賴伐爾言論空泛、達於極點、為外交所僅見云、（十四日路透電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄小恊約等國　宣言擁護國聯盟約　李維諾夫謂毋顧此失彼　葡萄牙履行義務不躊躇</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）今晨國聯大會開會、蘇俄·小恊約國·萄葡牙之代表均聲明其本國政府願履行國聯盟約加於彼等之義務、於是國聯續獲聲援、蘇俄代表李維諾夫宣稱、蘇俄政府之抒誠盡其所負國際義務、世界實無其匹、葡萄牙代表孟特羅宣稱、葡政府之履行其對國聯之義務、毫不躊躇、孟氏並莊嚴聲明葡國對國聯盟約之忠貞、南斯拉代表浦里志代表小恊約國宣稱、渠所代表之諸國、遵照所經宣布之政策、無論發生何事、仍將忠於國聯、今日最先演說者、為蘇俄外委李維諾夫、其言曰、如調解之努力歸於失敗、意阿爭議後提出於國聯行政院或國聯大會、則蘇俄政府將毅然判斷其曲直、决不為報紙濫施抨擊或其他恫嚇手段搖動其勇敢、蘇俄政府關於此項爭議之態度、業已確定、卽在原則上反對殖民地制度或藉以達帝國主義目的之事件是、國聯盟約、實為和平之工具、已為以前種種企圖微加損害、吾人不能再忍將使國聯盟約完全失效之新企圖、蘇俄政府之抒誠盡其所負國際義務、仳界實無其匹、如吾人散會時、確悉諸國代表已在此間聲明不容新企圖損及國聯盟約、則此次國聯大會將為國聯歷史中中界標吾人不欲再有嚴厲之試騐、如昔時吾人所受者、李氏於是泛述國聯之工作、而尤注重國聯收入之短少、及許多建議之失敗視之若易實行、其結果無異烏託邦、其結語曰、今有無類似烏託邦之事、而證明其不易實施者、吾人宜加以審察云、李氏演說之初、曾稱讀英外相霍爾擁護集體安全主義之言論、小協約國代表亦稱美霍爾之演說、此間人士現覺列強保衛國聯之圓陣、得蘇俄之援助、今已告完整、（十四日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）本日國聯會大會開會、選舉日本法學家長岡為海牙常設國際法庭法官、嗣後卽由葡萄牙代表殖民部長蒙特羅發表演說謂葡萄牙準備分担責任、以保障集體安全制云、</p>
<p>繼由蘇聯外委李維諾夫登壇發表演說、指陳蘇聯對於目前國際政治之觀點、主張已經開端之各項國際談判應賡繼進行、而以關於侵略國定義之談判為尤要、語至此、李維諾夫特別向意國代表陳述、謂侵略國定義倘經確定、則可避免種種之困難、蓋如是則意國卽無須官佈自由行動、而可正式申請國聯會根據侵略國定義、以抗議阿比西尼亞之侵略行動矣、若然、則余敢向意國代表保證、國聯會不僅可使意國得直、且當向高貴之意大利民族表示偉大之同情、如是則豈不更佳乎、李維諾夫繼復請求國聯會重行討論軍縮問題、尤其是蘇聯所提出各國完全解除軍備之建議、又謂「歐洲今必須在國聯會領導之下、創立集體組織、惜乎在日內瓦討論歐洲問題、或為非歐洲國家之代表所不願聞耳、且除意阿爭端以外、尚有其他問題、足以令人焦憂、世界和平不可分裂殊不宜顧此而失彼、就蘇聯本身而論、過去曾與法國捷克訂結互助公約、且復致力於東歐公約、對於集體安全制度已勉劾微勞、反之、雙方公約制度、則並不足以顯示和平之志願」、</p>
<p>李維諾夫繼又指出英國外相霍爾、對於集體安全制度、亦加以贊成結語則謂、蘇聯於意阿雙方均不欲有所偏袒、蘇聯所望者、國聯會盟約應使其成為和平工具而已、」</p>
<p>至是由捷克代表發言、謂小協約各國一致擁護國聯會盟約云、希臘外長瑪克維謨斯亦發表演說、力稱巴爾幹協約各國間之良善諒解、表示希臘願與各隣國西持親善關係云、最後拉特維亞代表門斯特發言、主張增強國聯會盟約之效力、至是國聯會行政院遂宣告休會、至午後三點三十分復開、（十四日哈瓦斯社電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄對英滿意　霍爾言論足糾正已往錯誤</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）眞理報云、「英霍爾外相在國　大會之演說至為重要、不容輕視、其中最足注意者為下述點卽霍爾力稱、英國政府願支持國聯、並關心集體安全、霍爾承認集體安全制度為保全和平最有效之方法、蘇聯所關心者厥為為和平而奮鬥、吾人唯有當戰爭危機什任何處所掀起之際、卽向此極威脅堅决鬥爭、乃能保全和平、故蘇聯輿論對於霍爾演說、只能滿意以霍爾之勇敢、乃能承認英國政府外交政策之中、確有若干錯誤、吾人必須承認、英國對於滿洲事伴之態度、英德最近締結之海軍協定、以及英國對於東歐互助公約未能積極援助、凡此均能令人之懷疑、英國是否眞係集體安全之適當贊助者焉、吾人希望霍爾演說得於英國政府之實際行動為其後盾、此種行動乃向戰爭威脅抗爭、初不問此種威脅究將影響英帝國之直接利害否」云、（十四日塔期雷）</p>

<h3>大家要努力各人的任務</h3>
<p>— 慕良</p>
<p>新社會的建設，是靠着社會份子，大家努力各人的任務，在分工合作的條件之下，這樣才能成功的。可是現在吾們中國任何建設上，感到最痛苦的，一方面就是沒有人做事，另一方面就是做事的人，也不肯盡職的去做；因之，要中國有一個新社會的產生，那是一輩子不會成功的。</p>
<p>吾們先從生物學的觀點，來證明一個人有努力於任務的必要：吾們要知道每個生物，都是由於許多細胞（單細胞動物是例外）所組織成功的，這個生物的各個細胞，都有一定的工作，無時或息；要是這樣，生物才能發榮滋長。社會是由各個人組織成功的，它是一個有機體，須得各個人都能盡一部份的責任，那才有進步的；所以要一個新社會的產生，吾們就有努力於各人任務的必要。</p>
<p>親愛的小朋友！你們是社會上未來的生力軍，一個新社會就是急待着你們去建設；然而在建設中，請你們不要忘掉努力自己的任務，應當把任務照着生物學的規例做去，那麼才不致於失望的。</p>
<h3>楊繼盛的童年</h3>
<p>— 陳古</p>
<p>楊繼盛（椒山）先生是明朝的大忠臣，他幼年時：家中很貧窮，他的父親不得不將他替人家去做牧童。</p>
<p>一天，他走到一所私塾，聽到裏面琅琅讀書的聲音，覺得非常羨慕；便也想去讀書，回家就同他父親說明，可是他的父親因為沒有錢；所以不能答應他，他心裏很氣，想道：為什麽人家有錢來讀書，而我沒有錢就不能讀書嗎？</p>
<p>他平時很愛畫荷花，因此，畫得極好，但是僅是在地上畫的，有一次，他的叔父同他講，你不如去買些紙與顏色來，畫了拿到城中去賣，就可以賺些錢來讀書，於是他便依叔父的話做去，果然賺了好些錢，他就買了許多書，當每天工作的時侯，就坐在牛背上讀書，看到不懂的地方，就向私塾內的先生問，那先生倒也很歡喜教這樣的孩子哩！</p>
<p>自此以後，他工作之餘，就畫了荷花去出賈，得着的錢，立刻去買書，因為他是這樣地用功，所以後來就做了萬古留名的大臣。</p>

<p>小朋友，假使你要適當地淸　你的牙齒和口腔，最好除了牙刷和牙膠　外，再預備少許消毒棉花，一根細柑木梗，和一隻漱口器。</p>
<p>市上出售的牙刷，形狀太大，刷起來未免要過分震動牙肉，而且把口腔的兩邊向外推出，成一種不良的形狀還有硬毛的牙刷，用的人很多，大都以為經用耐久，容易使牙齒淸潔，其實這種見解是錯誤的。</p>
<p>最良好，最合用的牙刷是小的一種，靠外裝軟的剛毛，靠內裝硬的剛毛。假使這種牙刷用得正確，那麼軟的剛毛刷在牙肉上、比按摩更好，同時硬的剛毛把牙齒淸潔得十分週到。</p>
<p>右手執牙刷，放入口中，從左面刷起，最好自左至右成一圓周。牙齒靠裏的一面，需要自上至下好像鋸木一般的動作去洗擦。凸出，凹入，或歪斜等劣齒，用牙刷很難刷到，那麽應該用一根細　木梗、梗的一端、繞些消毒棉花，在劣齒的內外周圍、慢慢地擦。</p>
<p>用鹽與水的溶液來洗口腔，最經濟的辦法了。鹽與水二者都是一種使牙齒淸潔和增加強力的東西。用鹽水漱口可使牙肉結實而健全。</p>
<p>末了，我們要記得淸潔牙齒，不是限於起身後洗面時的一次，最好每次餐後都要刷牙漱口的。</p>
<h3>雨</h3>
<p>— 浪</p>
<p>一羣小雲兒，</p>
<p>在天空中遊戲，</p>
<p>有的穿着藍衣，</p>
<p>有的穿着白衣。</p>
<p>忽然來了一陣風，</p>
<p>挾着不可當的冷氣。</p>
<p>冷呀！冷呀！</p>
<p>於是許名小雲兒便化作眼淚紛紛的落下大地。</p>
<h3>「國國丁」</h3>
<p>— 白丁</p>
<p>「國國丁，帶紅纓。騎紅馬，上南京。」這是海州的小朋友們時常在嘴裏快活地喊着的兒歌。國國丁便是一種野花蒲公英。其實它並沒有什麽紅纓，不過在莖子近花之處略略帶着些紅色，形狀是像鋸齒一樣；鮮明的黃色的花朶；葉子緊緊地藏在泥土裏。</p>
<p>一到了春天，在凄凉的墳頭上，高高的墻脚下，荒僻的園畔，蒲公英便開得興奮，茂盛。粱去是一片鮮嫩的淡黃色的花；加着春天的太陽流漾在上邊。小朋友們都歡喜得嘻嘻哈哈的笑起來，活潑潑地跳起來。</p>
<p>有些小娘把它採下了，挿在髪髮邊，高傲地在街上徜徉着，更顯出美麗，天眞。</p>
<p>國國丁還有一種益處。是去年的秋天裏。我在故鄉突然患癰，於是母親和姊姊在郊外找了五六棵國國丁來，把它搗得粉爛敷上了；不幾天也就好了。這很使我奇怪，在深秋裏還能看到那些可愛的小花呢！</p>
<p>小朋友，你們不要忘記那支：「國國丁，帶紅纓。騎紅馬，上南京。『的歌謠呀！</p>
<h3>水泥</h3>
<p>— 榕</p>
<p>小明在暑假中，沒有什麽事情做，所以常常看看書，尤其喜歡看日常生活中需要的物品製造法，如肥皂，火柴和　燭，伊都看見過，今天伊在書廚中又翻到一本水泥的製法，可惜是文言，伊看不懂，只能看其中的大意，於是去問伊的姊姊；姊姊，水泥有什麽功用啊？姊姊說：「水泥可以造橋，鋪地，造樑柱砌牆壁等等」伊又問道：『姊姊，怎樣造樑柱呢？」姊姊回答道：「妹妹，造樑柱先要用木板搭成功各種樣子，圓的，方的六角式等都可以，把調和的石子和水泥灌入，凝結堅固後，把外面的木板拆去，那就好了」伊又問「怎樣使橋造得堅固？」姊姊說；造橋和造樑柱，倘使純用永泥極容易折斷，若當中加了鋼條便堅固了。在後前用石造的橋和木造的樑　，還有極高的房子和很長的橋，都是不大容易建築的，近幾年來用了水泥和鋼骨，就是極長的橋和很高的房子，都能够造的了，世界著名的蘇格蘭之福斯橋和美國大城市紐約的克利斯勒房屋，高有六十八層，都是用水泥鋼骨製成的。」伊又問道：「姊妹，水泥怎樣製造的？「姊姊說：「妹妹，水泥的製法，把灰石研成細末，再加黏土和水拌和，把它放在窰中燒過，冷後取出，再把它研成細末就成功灰白色的粉未，卽是水泥。」妹妹又問道：「姊姊，我們雖然有了粉未一樣的水泥，怎樣用法呢？」姊姊回答他道：妹妹，用昨把水泥和砂石子加水拌和就可以用了。」</p>
<h3>中秋節一天的日記</h3>
<p>— 矜細</p>
<p>今天是廢曆的中秋節，據說今晚月色分外明亮，淸澈。我鄉習俗，無論貧富人家，今天要買些酒菜，月餅，芋艿，毛豆以及幾樣生菜，或者殺隻鴨過節。到了夜間，大家便坐在庭院裏，邊吃月餅，邊看月亮，算是天上人間一律團圓的意思。有的人家，晚上還要敲鑼鼓，放爆竹，迎接明月，直到月過正申，方才就寢。</p>
<p>前幾天，我在報上看到各地洪水為災的消息，又看到各慈善團體機關乞賑的文電，心中很有些感動，可是我是一個小孩子，沒有多少錢可以節省下來助賑。恰巧今天是中秋節，我吃過早餐後，就大着膽對父親說：「父親！現在外面各地災民嗷嗷無衣無食，我想來很難過。申報上刊着『多賑一文錢，多救一條命』的告白，我們為什麽不節省今天過中秋節的費用，來救救災民的性命呢？」父親聽了我的話，臉色很愉快，掏出他預備過節的十塊錢，叫我寫好信，到郵局買了匯票，寄到上海申報館收賑處去　　今天我只吃了兩個月餅，母親說：這月餅是間壁王家伯伯送來的，我也不計較什麽，吃過月餅後，我坐在壁角，肚裏暗暗的打算着：「這封助賑信大約三天後可到上海了，我願申報館快快彙成鉅欵賬給災民去！」（趙明兒記）</p>
<h3>一種藝術的欣賞</h3>
<p>— 亦菴</p>
<h3>好意</h3>
<p>— 請純才</p>
<p>只是存心良好，是不够的；還得要作為得妥善，如果要作為得妥善，必得要知道怎樣作為的方法。</p>
<p>有隻小熊，他的母親從懸崖上墜落下去，跌斷了頸子。他的父親是早已不知到那兒去了。</p>
<p>有個老隱士遇見這隻小熊，孤苦伶仃，飢寒交迫的悲啼。他很可憐這不幸的小動物，就把它帶回他那又溫暖，又淸潔，又舒服的家裏。他餵養它，撫愛它。它漸漸地長大起來。它愛他更甚過愛那甜蜜，它愛他更甚過愛世界上的一切事物。</p>
<p>一兩年後，熊長大成了一個很好看的動物，長得跟隱士差不多大，皮毛非常美麗。</p>
<p>是夏季裏的一天，天氣很好，隱士坐在椅上睡着了。老人家在飯後老是要打瞌睡的。隱士本是個老頭兒了。</p>
<p>從窗戶飛進來了一隻黃蜂。是一隻大黃蜂，高聲營營的叫，滿屋飛繞，繞到後來，忽然注意到了隱士的光頭和紅鼻子。實實在在，那是一個很紅很紅的紅鼻子。</p>
<p>熊坐在主人的身邊，很親熱的望着他。平日主人睡着的時光。它　是這樣兒。</p>
<p>它一眼有見那黃蜂，心裏很着急。它知道黃蜂會刺人的。</p>
<p>熊想：「如果這可惡的黃蜂在我的親愛的好主人的鼻子上刺一下，那才倒霉呀！」</p>
<p>那黃蜂越飛越近了！越來越近了！</p>
<p>熊　必定是要鬧亂子的！那黃蜂剛剛一落脚在隱士的鼻尖兒上，熊就突然拼命一巴掌撲打過去！</p>
<p>它存心本是良好的！但是它又怎樣去解釋明白呢？隱士所知道的，只是他的鼻子差不多快打平了，臉上受了重傷。年輕的熊那裏知道它自己的氣力是多麽大呢。</p>
<p>的的確確，熊存心本是良好的！但是隱士以為它「發狂」了。他說：「這東西已經長得很大了，不能再留在這兒了。」他這樣說了，就用木棍把熊趕走了。</p>
<p>的的確確，熊存心是良好的！但是要記着這熊的故事啊！</p>
<h3>媽媽變了小妹妹</h3>
<p>— 無錫競志小三　石芬芬</p>
<p>我家新來的老媽子，伊叫我姊姊為大小姐，我為小姐，而却叫媽媽為三小姐。這是甚麽　故呢？因為我媽媽是外祖母的第三個女兒，因此大家都喚伊三小姐，而我家現在的老媽子，正是外祖母那裏的人，也一向叫我母親為三小姐的，現在，仍照前的稱呼，在伊口中聽起來，母親不是反做了我的小妹妹了嗎？</p>
<h3>白山烏的故事（一）</h3>
<p>— 禧</p>
<p>（一）</p>
<p>在這世界中，做頭特殊的山烏？是一件何等的光榮和可痛的事情！處蒲風先生　寫我的話，我並不是頭言過其實的鳥，但是，唉！我是很稀有的，要找到我，實在是非常的困難。</p>
<p>我的父親和母親是兩頭好烏，在麥萊地方的一座幽僻的善花園中，住了好多年了。他們是一個模範的家庭，我的母親照例每年有三次的生產的時期，伊蜷伏在那茂密的灌木義中，坐在伊的蛋上打盹；我的父親雖已年老，仍然是漂亮得很，為表示他的熱情起見，成日的偷偷地逞留在伊的四週，得到了美味的蟲，便很當心的拴在他的尾尖上來送給伊吃，到了晚上，要是天氣晴和，他總得唱一支曲兒給伊聽，而也使附近一帶的人都聽得很快樂。這二對甜蜜的配偶，從來沒有反目過一次；從來沒有一絲黑雲籠罩在他們的中間。</p>
<p>我剛到這世界中來的時候，我的父親忽然發起脾氣來，這是他生平第一次的事，那時我還是頭灰色的皺見，他老人家實在也看不淸我的身材和毛色。他有時很懷疑的瞧着我，說道：「這是一個齷齪的孩子，倒像他一見了泥堆和灰堆，很要鑽進去玩玩似的，所以他總是醜陋不堪，使人瞧不上眼，」我的母親蜷伏在一隻當做窠的舊碗中，答道：『咦！我的親愛的朋友，像他道樣的年紀，你希望他長得怎樣美呢？在你小時節，你自己不也是模樣兒很齷齪的小東西麽？旦耐性兒等我們的孩子生長起來，你便可瞧到他是何等的美麗；他實在是我所生的孩子最好的一個。」</p>
<p>我的母親雖是偏袒着我，但是伊也　到我那一身該死的毛羽，在斬斬地生長，實在是　　極了；但伊也像一般的母親一樣，往往要偏袒伊們的孩子，以為這是伊們自己的過失，並且迴護着伊們的孩子，不受那惡述的打擊。</p>
<p>當我的毛羽在生長的時候，我的父親待我很好，他見我在一邊角落　瑟瑟地打顫，還給一些漿糊我吃糊但是到了我那一雙可憐的翅膀上生出一重新毛來的品兒，他眼見得一根根的全是白毛，就大發雷　的雷撲起來，我　他一定要拔去我的毛哩。唉！我沒有鏡子；不知首他發怒的緣故，我便自己問着自己，為什麼生着這樣好好的毛，反使他對我這般發怒呢？</p>
<p>一天，一道太陽的明光的着我一身新生的毛羽，引得我心中快樂起來。便在一條花徑中撲動着翅膀，開始歌唱起來。我的父親聽得了我的第一聲的歌聲，就像一抹燄火般直跳到空中。</p>
<p>「我聽得的是什麽聲音呀』他嚷着「這難道是一頭山烏的鳴聲號？我可是這樣鳴麼？這可以算得是鳴聲麼？」</p>
<p>當下他跳到我母親的身旁，做出一副可怕的嘴臉，說道：『該死的！那一個躺到你的窠中來的？』我的母親聽了這話，好生難受，立時從伊的碗中跳將起來，伊　想說話，但伊哭得塞住了氣；伊跌在地上，一半兒暈過去了。我見伊快要死了，嚇得發抖，就投身在我父親的膝膝下。</p>
<p>「呀！我的父親！　我對他說：「我雖是鳴錯了，我雖是生錯了毛羽，請不要責罰我的母親！上天不給我和你同樣的聲音，這難道是母親的過失嗎？我沒有一個與你同樣的黃色的嘴，和一身與你同樣的法國式的黑衣服，這難道也是伊過失嗎？要是上天有意要使人變成一個怪物，而要別的人代我受過，那麽還是讓我一個人來受罰吧！</p>
<p>我的父親說道：『並不是這個問題，你倒底為什麽鳴出那樣的聲音來？是誰呌你這樣的鳴，違反了我們的習慣的一切的成規？』</p>
<p>我柔聲下氣的說道：『唉！父親，我只是很自然的鳴音，因為天氣很好，使我覺得很快樂，也許為的是多吃了蒼蠅之故吧。』</p>

<p>男二百公尺參加决賽者僅六人、這是程金冠的拿手好戲、發脚即佔先、維持到終點、並以二四秒一破二四秒二之省紀錄、惟程之本人紀錄則有退化、據說是腿傷未愈、曾榮忠本有亞軍希望、結果屈居第四、聽說是身體也不爽、但他本人對人說、是準備於四白公尺决賽中、要將老程的紀錄打破、故未十分緊張、</p>
<p>女百公尺決賽</p>
<p>女白公尺參加决賽共六入、二三兩區爭奪是項冠軍、吳菊心端的不凡、逞五十公尺冠軍餘威、而膺首席、龐媛玉連日身體不爽、各項比賽均受影響、不得不退居亞軍、女子心地狹窄、賽後不樂照像、經裁判勸駕、力得一影、</p>

<p>婦女園地花選  心沐　　上海籌賑水災游藝大會，辦理花園選舉，揭曉時到會觀禮者，數達四千餘人之多，「集芳樓中，擁擠不堪，北里姊妹，大半蒞止，時鶯鶯燕燕，景况殊為熱鬧。」花選自一時至三時餘，方始唱錄完竣，正式揭曉，共計一萬四千〇六十二票。（據六日報載）　　大概這又是人心不死的表現。但不知擁擠在集芳樓中的「觀禮者」和那些花選投票人在熱鬧之中可還記得湖北鍾祥天水二縣陸沉，淹死人民各十萬；「岳口至張截港間，撈獲浮屍一萬四千具。」這一類的事實？　　在同一個國家中，一方面有十餘省三百餘縣遭受着空前水災，淹斃人民百餘萬，災民千萬的事實，一方面有四千餘人參觀花國大選的盛事，這未免有點兒奇怪！不過這些奇怪事，正多着，也說不勝說。這裏只想對那些所謂「北里姊妹」們，說幾句話。　　「北里」的姊妹們！你們可曾知道，你們也是以災民的資格在參加水災遊藝大會？所不同的只是他們是淹在水中而你們是沈淪在火坑。人們為你們辦理這種花選，是尊重你們，還是侮辱你們，玩弄你們和糟踢你們？　　此次花選，所謂「花國題名，」有花國大總統，國務總理，參院長，衆院長，才部總部，貌部總長，性部總長等等，當選的人，很得意，很覺得榮幸吧？落選的人，也很失望吧？但是高興和失望的是愚蠢得冬麽可憐喲！高興些什麼呢？你們正像一隻羔羊，要是屠夫對羊說，這只羊肥，這只羊美，羊就高興了起來，沒有給他稱讚的，大為煩惱，這多麽可憐和可笑呵！　　你們不要以為你們可以靠了這些男子們的歡心過活一輩子，你們不是生意一年比一年淸淡麼？但是各種捐稅不是一年比一年重麼？你們不都是揹了許多的債麽？你們中間不是有包取夫的工錢也欠，甚至於瓜子香烟都欠的麽？你們中間不是有許多姊妹從前身子是自己的，揹了債拿身子抵押給人家麼？那些客人不是一年比一年精明麼？這樣下去，能再過幾年？×國總統任期三年，你們花國的總統或許不到三年就得下台了！　　醒醒吧，火坑中的災民！蘇聯的兒童  汶源　　兒童年已於今年八月一日起實施了。中國兒童一向是不大被人注意的，現在却有人記起他來，不能不說是兒童的幸運。在這兒童年頭把外國的兒童生活介紹給國人，並不能作為多事吧。以下的是關于蘇聯兒童的一般　　莫斯科的十四條綠蔭公路在莫斯科有十四條綠蔭公路，一共有幾十基羅米達長。雖然大人也可在這些綠蔭公路上散步，可是他們總是讓給兒童在那裏遊玩。因此這幾條綠蔭公路在事實上就成了專門屬於兒童的了。在夏天裏，那裹有一堆堆的黃沙給兒童玩；還有小馬，小驢—和小駱駝給他們騎，在冬天裏，特別劃川些地方給兒童溜冰。這樣，從歲到八歲的兒童，都能很安心的在這幾十基羅米達的綠靑靑的草木中遊玩着。　　兒童自已的報紙　在莫斯科你常常可以看到七八歲的兒童，手裏拿了報紙坐在椅上，根熱心地的看着報。這種情形，不能不使你驚奇，剛才會唸字的小傢伙，居然會像煞有介事的看起報來。　　其實，他們所看的報紙，是一抑兒童的報紙—在莫斯科出版的「少年先鋒眞理報。它是特為那些可以參加少年先鋒隊年齡的兒童們出版的，編輯等工作都有兒童自己參加。這張報紙的形式跟大人看的一樣：有電訊，有家庭裏的和各方面的消息，有重要的論文，有諷刺文章和時事攔。這些文章報紙，兒童都能够懂的。　　兒童的吃飯問題　莫斯科入學的孩子有四五八·六〇〇入·其中六六·〇〇〇個可以在學校裏免費吃飯；餘下的三九一·六〇〇個可以出很低的代價而得到很好的點心，茶和白麵包。　　莫斯科郊外的第四十六分校裏的免費吃飯，弄得更完備。兒童可以在一本簿子上寫下他明天要吃什麽菜。　　兒童的書　在沙皇時代，全國只有二個兒童圖書館，一個在彼得堡，一個在莫斯科。現在呢，沒有一僩城市沒有兒童圖書館了。　　在一九一三年，莫斯科只有一個兒童圖書館，借書只有三百三十個。而現在呢？莫斯科每個月（註二）都有一個兒童圖書館；此外，還有四十多個分佈在學校裏，兒童俱樂部裏，工廠裏，公園裏，偕書的共有六萬個。　　「大人不准進去的兒童公園列寗格勒的市中心，有個專門容納十歲以下的兒童公園。大人是不能進去的，只有倍着兒童的大人才能進去。　　在公園裏，有許多東西安排好給兒童運動的或遊玩的。那裏有跑冰鞋，鞦　，輪轉機（註三）和閱報室。有許多的玩具，有可以躺下的上面有遮太陽的帳蓬的長椅。　　在過去一年中，有十萬以上的列寗格勒的小公民，到這公園裏去。　　變成作家的流浪兒童有個無家可歸的兒童，曾經過了十一二年的流浪生活和小偷生活。後來他被人送到一個一兒童之家一去，當他長大時，他就變成了一個作家，並且曾出席去年舉行的全蘇聯作家大會。這個作家的名字呌阿夫狄尹珂，他的名著是「我愛」。　　哥德是個大臣，托爾期泰是個公爵，契珂夫是個醫生，莫泊桑是個官吏；也有些作家是保險公司的經理，攝影師，　票員，律師，永手，工匠。可是一個沒有受過教育的小偷變成作家，不能不算是奇事。但這祇是蘇聯兒童教育成績之一而巳。　　在街道上　莫斯科的小學生自己組織指導他們的同學在街道上，公園中和別的公共塲所裹的行為的團體。　　這些兒童是兒童自己對於公共秩序最嚴格的監督者。其中特別努力的是一個醫生的兒子，西米諾夫斯基。他曾經組織了二十二個壞孩千到他的隊伍裏。這樣統制的壞孩子，現在却在同學中成為監督名譽和紀律的了。　　兒童市　在莫斯科的中央文化與休息公園裏，有個兒童市。兒童市共分四個部份：嬰兒，四歲以下的兒童，學齡的兒童以及十四歲以下的兒童。每部份都有自己的房子，自己的規則，自己的教育人員和醫務人員。　　如果你到這些兒童的樂園去參觀，那你就可看到兒童臉上都露着笑容，很起勁的玩着他們的玩具，旁邊有專門訓練過的看婦和教育人員當心着。　　兒童發明家　在蘇聯不但有許多成年發明家，而且還有許多兒童發明家。蘇聯的發明家俱樂部在學校裹「兒童之家」中迅速的發達着。　　單在鳥克蘭首都基夫一地就有二百多個兒童發明家。有個十二歲的兒童呌卡伐萊夫，在不久以前發明了一種完全新式的自來墨水筆。另外一個管馬達的十三歲的兒子包力河旦珂，發明了一種機關車加油的機器。　　每年七萬兒童　莫斯科每年大約有七萬偭新公民出世，既然有這麼多的小公民出世，那麽對於生產就得有很好的設備。臨產的母親在國家設立的產科醫院裏不但能受到很好的待遇，而且還有人指示她如何科學的地去當心嬰兒。就是在產後一個月中，產婦仍舊可以到醫院裏去檢騐自己和嬰兒的身體。　　兒童的保護　兒童在蘇聯是享受法律上特殊保護的。每個嬰兒當他快到這新的世界上來時，可以免費從公家得到一套嬰兒服裝。如果嬰兒的母親是很忙碌的，可以把嬰兒免費放在托兒所裏，可以免費得到檢查過的牛奶和專家對於保護嬰兒的指示。　　莫斯科還設立了母子保護院，研究怎樣養育强壯的康健的後代。　　在日常生活中的見實由享受着特殊的權利。比方　電車，他們可以從前面上去，而大人只能從電車尾上去。在火車上，另有專門的「母子」車。每個火車站都有母子室。在商店中，在郵局裏，抱着兒童的婦女常常得到優先權的。　　六十年以前，杜思退夫斯基曾說道：「這個國家的人民對於兒實是沒有恩愛的。一個國家的前途既然不能樂觀，自然更沒有快樂了」。　　但是現在—革命後的十七年多些的時期，蘇聯每個人民都知道愛護他們將來的主人翁了。如果杜氏得知了，不知會起什麼感想。中篇創作回家（續）  蘇虹　　昨天葉家弄有人嫁囡，嫁妝剛剛抬過山麓的橋邊，突然有一隊強盜跳出來把嫁妝統統接了去，後來有人講和，出了十八塊錢，總算贖回了被頭和衣箱。噢！還有一椿，晤，還有一椿，上道地富林家裏昨夜給賊跳了跳。灶頭老虎（偷廚房中的一切東西，如鑊鍋等。）飯菜吃光，掛在棟樑上要請菩薩的一隻　豬頭也偷去，……眞是現在到處，都聽得偷搶，時世不知道為什麽要弄到這樣……」　　唔！總要出個皇帝就好！前幾天一顆星移座，人家說那就是眞命天子，只要他一上皇位，天下就會太平。」　　一時大家默默地吃粥，只有嘴巴嚼動的聲音。　　嫂嫂在計劃着，有了米，如何設法買點東西過過年，至少灶司菩薩總要供奉一下。　　母親手伸下去，輕輕地在袋外摸摸五十八個銅板，計算淸，買多少銅板醬油，買幾個銅板鹽，打豆腐，菜是現有的，另外只要再買點豆芽和豆腐乾。她剛計劃定當，抬起頭頂備一同媳婦說明，却見兩個男子進門來，一個人手執簿子，一個人肩背錢袋。後面還跟了個地保。　　—收戶口稅　！執簿子的男子說。　　母親一時愕然放下粥碗。　　嫂嫂也轉過頭去，瞧瞧他們，又回轉頭來與母親視綫相對了一會，也放下碗，跨出凳子　　對付：　　—啊呀！很對不起，恰巧沒有錢，明年付罷！　　—這怎麽可以，上月你還欠着，今天必須一起拿去。　　—先生！實在沒有，明年我們總一定付。　　—年關到啦，誰等你們，你要　得這是上面局裏　下來的，不能不付。　　地保走上前一步，不說什麽話，好似示威似的。　　嫂嫂還想再週旋，母親却從袋裏取銅板來了。　　—一共兩角錢，我已在薄子上寫好啦。收條，哪，收條　　那男人提過一張紙。　　他們走後，母親坐下，數着剩下的銅板。　　—啊彌陀佛，只剩了四個　　—那你為什麽鬆鬆地拿出來呢，同他們多說說，也許可以欠一下。」嫂嫂生氣似的說。　　——啊！那怎麽可能呢，他們是上督下的，你不付他們，他們會給我們吃王法的，你不看見那地保在着？」母親喃喃地說。　　佑福婆婆也播嘴了：「他們起初也向我要什麼稅，我說，我是一個光孤老，無子無丁，也不算一個家，要我的稅，我只有一塊老骨頭。」她捧着吃完了的粥碗，舌子括得晶光，一邊送碗到桌上，一邊說：　　—粥，眞好吃，米又白，還是自己搗的，還是洋機器裏搗的？」　　從前一般的搗米，都是以人工。蠻大一塊石頭，一個人或是兩個人「蓬答蓬答」搗半天，還搗不了三斗米。現在農民協會的會長聰明，他到上海去買了一部機器，（聽說那機器是外國運來的）。開了個機米廠，一村中有租米收的人家都到那邊去輾，「軋軋軋」的一個鐘頭可以弄白幾石米，可是有一般人，如小尼子的父親，壓野豬的那個男子，他們就恨死這機器，本來搗米竟有好些日子可以打短工，現在就空淸手沒有事做。在嫂嫂呢，她有了幾斗米，當然不會化了錢拿到機米廠去輾，就是呌人工也不會，自然只有勞自己的力，這煮粥的米是她獨個兒趕搗起來的。　　——我們是連向別人賺錢也來不及，還會給別人賺去。」嫂嫂回答，她對佑福婆婆很討厭待這位客人走後，她又向母親繞嘴，說母親不會做人家，弄到這樣田地，還會拿粥做人情，竟咕嚕了半天。婦女問題講座第九講　婦女問題的內容及其發展　第一節婦女問題的發生條件  君慧　　我們在前面數講中，大體講明了各主要時代及主要社　的婦女生活，由此可以得到如下的結論：　　（一）在原始共同體社會，婦女除了負担養育子女的資任外，更能够同男子樣參加一切社會的生產活動，因此婦女在社會上佔優越地位。　　（二）自從財產私有制發生，財富集中於少數男子手裏以後，婦女在社會的生產上成為男子的補助者，甚至脫離生產勞動而只執行消費任務，從此婦女便處於男子　隸屬地位。　　（三）因此，婦女若要獲得和男子同等　社會地位則須先　婦女也能够參加生產　動的社會條件，同時必須以共同生產，共同消費的史高的社會制度來替代財富集中於少數男子手裏的社會制度。　　假使說，以上的結論是沒有錯誤的，那末我們可以確信的知道：所謂婦女問題决不是女性對男性的問區，而是婦女對社會制度的問題，牠和其他種種社會問題例如經濟政治，法律，宗教，教育，勞動等等問題，有着密切的關聯，同時成　這些問題中的一環。所以　　婦女問題也和其他的社會問題樣在一定的歷史的根據底下存在着又在定的社會的條件底下被　起或解决。　　我們要　得任何個社會問題，都在其解决所必需的物質條件未曾存在或者未曾把握這條件的生成過程以前，是决不會被提出的。所以，史的唯物論者正確的指出：「人類從未提出自己所不能解决的問題。」　　就婦女問題言之在過去奴隸制社會及封建時代，雖然存在着婦女被壓迫的事實，但因為可能把牠解决的物質條件還未存在，故無所謂婦女問題。到了資本主義社會，隨濟生產技術的發達和科學文明的進步，解决婦女問題的物質的及請神的條件漸見成熟，於是這問題　成為主要的社會問題。最後左未來的新社會，婦女開題是不會存在的，因為這問題在從資本主義社會推到新社會　　過渡時期中已經得到了根本的解决。　　然則，到了資本主義社會，婦女問題在如何　　　　　件底下被提起的呢？關於這問題，我們可以從以下三方面加以觀察。　　第一是經濟的條件。自從資本主義的商品經資替代了封建的農業經濟，機器工業替代了手工業以來，從來在家庭內處於經濟的消費者或補助生產者地位的婦女都能參加國民經濟上有價值的生產勞動。如加入產業工廠，創造社會的價值，在生產上占着和男子同等的地位。這種婦女勞動者在產業革命當時巳經有可觀的數目，到現在在產業發達的國家，女工數幾乎凌駕於男工數。她們是提出婦女問題的主覜的基本　素。　　第二是社會的條件。社會的經濟基礎的變化，必然引起政治上，法律上，道　上以及家族，宗教，教育等社會生活的根本的變化。宗教革命是打破了嫌女　僧侶的迷信生活，法國大革命是啟示了婦女的政治生活，國民義務教育制度的實施，家族制度的變質以及資本主義的新道德的樹立等等，都是使婦女放棄了從來的因襲生活而建立了適合於資本主義社會的新的生活關係。換言之，女子教育的普及，家庭內婦女任務的縮少，男女間社交公開，戀愛及結婚的自由乃至職業開放等等，都是促進婦女自覺的社會的條件。　　第三是意識的條件。資本主義社會的經濟基礎及其社會生活所反映出來的意識形態，也是提出婦女問題之一個要因。例如自由主義及民主主義思想是給婦女問題以很大的影響。尤其美國的獨立宣言及法國的人權宣言是強力的刺戟了歐美婦女的人格的自覺。市民社會的知識婦女們便由此發起了女權主義的婦女運動。　　要而霄之，婦女問題在資本主義社會從封建社會的胞胎中蛻化出來的時候，便由新興的市民階級提了出來，一直到現在還沒有把牠解决，但是市民階級隨着這社會的發展，不斷的製造了解决這個問題的客觀的及主觀的可能條件。同時不斷地充實了婦女問題的內容。　　我本相在本講中，關於每個婦女問題，加以詳細的考察，但是所謂婦女問題這名詞所包括的問題非常之多，而且牠是繼續發展，繼續提出新的問題，例如最近在各國提出來的婦女回家問題或女子軍訓問題，决不是屬於勞動問題或教育問題，牠顯然帶有獨特的新的性質。若要把這類問題都加以說明，則不單為篇幅所不許，而目在講述的技術上亦有不便，因此在以下幾節中袛能選出幾個主要的問題如政治，教育，職業，勞動等問題而講述牠的發生及發展的過程便止。</p>

<p>業餘漫譚家世淸白  李用中　　我國學術界，除「國故」而外，新科學思想向所落後，然事有出於例外者，卽優生觀念似亦為我國國　之一角。何以言？蓋我國向注意「家世淸白」故也。　　淸維新初季，興辦學堂，欽頒之學則卽有以「家世淸白」入學資格　　。時至民國二十餘年中尚有首都京華中學開除學生王玉蓉之舉，其罪狀為王生兼操歌女生涯，家世大有不淸不白之嫌也。萬仞宮牆之內，於是知無家世不清白者之立足地矣！　　再遠尋史籍，古人對門第觀念向所重視，故士大夫階級與平民間劃然有鴻溝在焉，推繹原因，無非因士大夫階級以平民之家世多不淸不白之故也·至於士大夫階級之家世是否擬獲淸且白，則不暇間聞矣！　　又南朝梁代有東海王源者，為當世之世族，嫁女於富陽滿氏。沈約上奏章曰：「王滿聯姻，實駭人聽聞！此風一開，將來日見其多，辱沒世家身分，應治以罪！」沈約之重視世家門第，躍然紙上。又南朝來孝武帝時，路太后之姪孫瓊之往會世族王僧達；僧達以瓊之爲寒門，不理；瓊之恚然而返。僧達待瓊之去後，焚其床席。路太后以其姪孫爲人冷遇，語於帝，然孝武帝雖以萬乘之尊，亦無如之何，曰：「瓊之年幼，自討沒趣耳！」盡年幼之人，多不自知其家世之是否清白，引孝帝之所以責瓊之爲自討沒趣也！應時文章黑人在美國  冰　　意阿衝突的緊張驚起了全世界的黑色人種，從菲洲到美洲的黑人都紛紛起來請纓抗敵，遊行示威，以保衛他們的阿比西尼亞。於是，素來不大為人重視的黑人，在現時卻引起了全世界的人極大的注意。但是，非洲的黑人因爲是意阿衝突的主要脚色，因爲與瀕於危機的世界和平有直接關係，所以他們的一切巳日益明白地顯示在我們眼前了；惟美洲的黑人，雖在數量上很多，但其一切情形郤很少有人知這。因此，我們想趁這全世界注意黑人問題之際來談談美國的黑人，這想來不會是毫無意義的吧。　　據統計，美國人口總計約有一億二千萬人，其中就有一千二百萬以上的黑人，佔美國全人口的百分之十。這些黑人並非自來就生長在美國，而是外來的。最初是在一六二零年，當時美國南部諸州因爲要開發土地，需要勞動者，於是便從荷蘭的奴隸商那里買入了許多非洲黑人，當作奴隸來使用。因爲成績很好，所以後來又繼續買入，及至一七九零年時，在美國黑人已達七十六萬之多了。此後美國黑人的增加及其與全美人口之比例情形有如下表：　　年限　　黑人人數　對於總人口　　（單位千人）　的百分比　　一七九〇　　一八〇〇　　一八五〇　　一八六〇　　一九〇〇　　一九二〇　　一九三〇　　七五七　　一·〇〇二　　三·六三九　　四·四四二　　八·八三四　　一〇·四六三　　一一·八九一　　一九·二七　　一八·八八　　一五·六八九　　一一·六〇　　一〇·七〇　　一九·九〇　　九·七〇　　上表所表示的黑人的人數在美國是在日益增加，但其對全美人口的百分比率却是在漸次减少。這是因為白色人種移入美國的也在日益增加，其數量比黑人的還要大，所以才顧示出了上表那樣的情勢。但是，自一九一四年大戰爆發後，特別是一九二〇年美國施行移民限制法以後，情勢乙日益顯示不同了，現在美國黑人對其全人口的百分比率，比較起過去來，已有了顯著的增加。　　美國南北戰爭的結果，一八六〇年廣除了從來的奴隸制度以後，在法律上對於黑人已給與和白人同等的權利，但在事實上黑人依然沒有從此得到完全同等的權利，特別是在黑人最多的南部諸州。很顯然的事實，如南部諸州所訂的所謂選舉資格，就有敎育程度與財產的限制，這便是在實際上奪去了許多黑人的選舉權，因素來被奴役壓迫的黑人大多是少有財產而敎育程度又是較差的。至於在一般社會中，則是隨處都可見到對黑人的不平的待遇。如旅館飲食舖和理髮店等地方都常常無理由地拒絕黑人的顧客；劇塲雖不排斥黑人，但只准其坐最下級的座位；更奇怪的，就是講「自由，平等，博愛」的敎會也排斥黑人，凡是白人出入的敎會，概不許黑人進去；此外如乘坐汽車，電車，也可以看到黑人所遭受到的不平待遇的情形。所謂「同等權利」者，在這些實際情况下已成爲了虛僞的名詞。　　不通，在美國的黑人並不是沒有希望的，他們　　到了政治社會的種種　迫，但他們的向上的心却仍是活躍着。近年來美國黑人在各方面都有顯著的進步。南部十八州的黑人的兒童入學者，在一九一六年是百分之七十，現在已達到百分之八十了。同時，受過高等敎育的黑人也很多，大學畢業從事知識的職業的人也有相當的多數。據一九二〇年的調查，在美國黑人中就有：律師九五〇人，醫生三、四九五人，牧師一九、五七一人，敎員三五、五六三人，女敎員二九、二四四人，美術家二五九人，俳優一、九七三人，牙科醫生一、〇〇九人，音樂家五、九〇二人，攝影師六〇八人，合計不下十萬人。在這中間，也有一些爲現今著名的社會運動家，教育家，美術家，小說家，詩人：這些都是美國黑人所可誇耀的。　　至於美國黑人的生活和財產狀態，也在日益改進中，那些過去作奴隸的，現在已有許多成爲商人或農民了。其全財產的總數，在一九〇二年約有三億元，到一九二〇年時則增至約三十億元，現在已經是在五十億元以上了。他們所經營的保險公司的數目有三十多個，共資本有二千萬元；同時他們遝有十三個商業及儲蓄銀行，其資本也有二千萬元　　美國黑人的居住地向來是在南部諸州，其在北部者很少。但近來由南部移到北部者却在日益增多，因之黑人問題在美國就更行複雜了。大家知道，美國的工業地帶是在北部，向來是靠歐洲的移民以供給其勞動者的，但自一九及一九二四年美國移民。</p>
<p>Page 23</p>
<p>國移民入國後，由歐洲各供給其勞動者的事情發生了問題。恰巧那時美國經濟正在發展，需要大量的勞動力，於是從來以南部為唯一天地的黑人便開始陸續移到北部工業地帶來了。然而素來在南部諸州引起問題的黑人之移住北部，同時也在北部諸州發生出新的問題，這不僅是原來在南部諸州的黑人問題需要北部來對付，而且北部的勞動組合如何待遇黑人勞動者也是大成問題的：再加以美國的有些白種人的人種偏見很深，對於新移住來的黑人當然非常輕視，由此人種的矛盾就也在北部發展起來。　　現在，由於在美國的黑人之受到實際上的不平待遇，由於他們在各方面之積極向上，再由於他們之由南部移住到北部工業地帶，所謂黑人問題在美國已日益成為重要的問題了。經濟現勢世界生產現狀  方威　　許多經濟學者都希望着并且斷定一九二九年下半期開始的經濟恐慌必定可以轉好，因為他們都相信資本主義恐慌的定期律，在過去是每一度恐慌之後不但立即恢復了原狀，而且更促進了資本主義的新發展。但是他們却忘掉了在資本主義盛期，因為世界市場尚有餘隙，可以因恐慌而更促使他們進行資本與工具的更高度的集中，更改進其技術與生產力，更深入於世界的落後區域，以繁榮其資本主義。然而現在却情勢大異了，世界市場已經沒有絲毫空隙可以作為它的鼓脹病之洗瀉的條件，所以它的過度集中資本與生產工具和改進生產技術，提高生產等等都沒有可能。即使勉強向這方面走去，也會碰壁成為更深刻巨大和更長期的恐慌，自然，要想得着自然的循環與恢復是很少可能的了。而目前的世界的經濟總趨勢就是如此。　　全世界的這次恐慌係自一九二九年開始的，至一九　　　三　年，已遠於極點。雖然在此時期中有些國家以人工的方法，使它得着相常的恢復，但其效果仍是很微弱的·就世界生產來說，全世界的最重要的煤，錢，鋼的生產，一九三二年中成為從來未有的低落·在這年中英國煤產後退二十九年，只當一九〇三年的產量；美國後退三十一年，只當一九〇一年的產量；德國後退三十四年，只當一八九八年的產量。錢一方面，英國後退七十六年，只當一八五六年的產量；美國後退四十二年，只當一八九〇年的產量；德國後退四十五年，只當一八八七年的產量。至於鋼，英國，美國，德國的後退年數為三十五，二十九，三十八年，只各相當於一八九七，一九〇三，一八九四的產量。由一九二九到三二年世界所少生產的煤，錢，鋼，石油，汽車量，若以戰前價格計，共少生產價值六千萬萬至六千五百萬萬馬克的生產品。　　若就全世界的工業生產說，生產工具的生產額，以一九二八年為一〇〇，則一九二九年雖增至一一〇，一九三〇年即降至九六，一九三一年更降至八二，一九三二年竟低到六二，比一九一三年的六九還差，一九三三年也只有稍微增加至七五。在消費生產額上，一九二九年為一〇五，一九三〇年為九八，一九三一年為八一，只與一九一三年相當，一九三二年竟回復至八九，一九三三年也不過九六。上兩項生產的前一項，在一九三二年美國只當一九二八年百分之四八·二，德國五〇·二，英國八五·三，波蘭最低，為四九·四，法國為八〇，日本最高，竟佔九九·五。後一項生產。美國只當一九二八年百分之八一·三，德國七七·七，英國九〇·五，波蘭六一·六，法國六四，也只有日本要算最髙，竟增到一一〇·三。全世界工業生產的總指數，若以一九二八年為一〇〇，則一九三三年每月平均數只及該年的百分之八三·二。於此可見那時恐慌的嚴重了。　　至於農業方面，因為工業的凋敝，原料需要減低，城市工資降低，失業增加，消費力弱，農產品的銷路便隨之減少，銷路減少，價格低落，既然要減低生產量。現在且來看一看棉花·生絲·羊毛·小麥·糖·樹膠等生產額的變動罷。　　照上表看來，大部分的重要農業生產　是下降的，而且到一九三三年其低落情形尚未停止。　　又從農業產品價格的低落，也可以看出農業產品滯銷中，農民生活困苦的農業的嚴重性來。我們且舉幾個例來說霸。一九二九年七月每千公斤棉花價為美元二一四元，而三二年同月為六六元，三三年同月為八七元，　　的各同期價格為五一　一三，一六元·黃豆的各同期價格為二九，一二，一一元。至於小麥，加拿大頭等小麥一九遙九年七月每百公斤値三〇·三金法郎，一九三二年値九·一法郎，一九三三年十月僅値七·九法郎。倫教的丹麥牛油每百公斤在一九二九年十二月値四五九法郎，一九三三年同月僅値一八二法郎。肉價在倫教由二〇四跌至一〇七法郎，在柏林由一四五跌至八二法郎。因為銷路減少，農產品過剩，所以美國把小麥玉米當燃料，荷蘭丹麥殺乳牛作肥料，巴西把幾百萬噸的咖啡傾入海中。　　是農業恐慌的寫真。　　自然，在用人工的方法之際，一九三三年以來亦有些國家的生產有相當恢復，但就全世界說，直至一九三四年四月止，其工業生產也仍只恢復到一九二八年的百分之九五·五，且此後又下降了，因為五月的指數只為九四·五，六月份為九二·八，七月為八八·八。炭胡生產只有日本到一九三四年五月增至一九二八年的百分之一四八·一，英國到一九三四年六月增至一〇四·一，而美國在一九三四年五月尚停留在七七·一的指數，比一九三二年平均數增加了一八·九，比一九三三年平均數增加了五·四。德國一九三四年只</p>

<p>為八八·五，法國亦只為七八而已。　　在農業方面，其恐慌不但沒有回復，甚至仍在下落。因為棉花生產一九三三至三四年雖增加為二五·三六一千包，但一九三四至一九三五年的預計將只有二二·三六七千包，比一九三二至三三年的二三·五八五千包還要少。小麥一九三四年預計只為三·六一三百萬Buukel，糖為二五·五六九千噸，樹膠為七二〇·〇〇〇噸，即是說小麥和樹膠比一九三三年還要少些。假使你從農產物的價格上去比較，你便可以知道農村的因苦尚在加深。例如加拿大乾酷和丹麥白脫，則由一九三三年之九〇仙到九一仙跌至一九三四年之八四仙，與一九三三年之六〇仙到六八仙跌至一九三四年之五〇仙到五八仙。雖然紐約巿的棉花，生絲每磅價格及芝加哥的小麥每Bueuker其最低最高價格，都由一九三三年之一一·七五到五·九〇，二·二一到一·一〇·一·一六到四四又八分之五，增至一九三四年之一二·六六到一一·七六·一三·〇五到一二·〇七·九八·三到八八元，但這只是通貨膨漲與生產降低的結果，並不是自然的轉好。　　總之，就目前的全世界經濟狀况說，在生產方面無論工業農業都因巿塲缺乏，消費力降低，形成銷路滯塞，生產過剩，失業增多，因而生產也降低了的現象。一切人為的計劃不過是使各集團經濟間加緊衝突，走向戰爭的道路而已，並不能正常地渡過恐慌，恢復繁榮，提高生產，循資本主義之興盛期的恐慌律循環下去。要想恢復它昨日的繁榮，是一件很難期其必現的事體。外埠郵政代辦所歌巿  明月　　南京通訊　　首都的夫子旋是著名的「歌巿」，除了大鼓書塲外，清唱茶社也有十餘家，如「月宮」，「天韻樓」，「四明」，「羣樂」，「廻龍閣」，「雪園」等都是。這些茶社各擁着數十名歌女，作為號召顧客的工具，所以，因為歌女的「色藝」有分別，而茶社的生意也就有好的壞了。　　「月宮」的茶資最貴，別家賣二角，牠特收三角。這並非由於座位舒適，招待週到，而是因為擁有一個著名的歌女，叫做想容。她的「色」固不足道，而「藝」却値得欣賞，如道白的清晰，嗓音的嘹亮，歌詞的純熱，腔調的圓潤，在夫子廟一般唱「鬍子生」的歌女中是首屈一指的。所以「月宮」的茶資雖貴，茶客却仍很擁擠。　　不過茶客最多的，還是要推「羣樂」，還不到開塲時問，便有數百人等候，全塲總計要賣到八百多個座位。原因是該社漂亮的歌女較多，而茶資又祗收二角，所以一般人便都趨之若騖了。這兒的壓台脚色本是唱生角的丁美玉，但並沒有好大的號召力，實在的台柱却要算張翠紅，她的青衣原就不錯，更兼還有一張好臉兒和那媚人的姿態，於是一般少年公子和「顧曲周朗」便都傾倒在她的脚根兒下了。她的羣眾很廣泛；除了官僚商人外，還有學生及文氓，所以後來她的芳名漸漸由夫子廟搬到了最高學府的××大學，由羣樂茶社搬到了各報的副刋。不過美色雖人人所愛，却為有錢有勢者刧取去了；今年的四月間她已經收拾歌聲，跟人作了太太，這不單是追隨她的羣眾大為掃興，就是羣樂的生意亦减色多了。　　其中生意一貫保持平衡的狀態的，要數「天韻樓」，因為牠牌子老，歌女也沒有什麽大的變動。這兒的台脚是唱生角的雲鶴，「色藝」都還過得去。　　「四明」的歌女校少，唱得好的也沒有幾個，但因為有個黃蓮芳，茶客便見踴躍了。她的青衣本沒有壓台的資格，但是她的面龐和身段却要賽過夫子廟的一切歌女，過去還有張翠紅尚可同她對敵，現在只好讓她獨霸一方了。她的羣眾也很複雜，有許多大學生甚至拿她當作尋愛的標準或吹牛的資料，這情形我是親眼看見過好幾次的。　　至於「雪園」，「迴龍閣」以及其他各茶社，生意比較清淡，同時也沒有郵色的歌女，這裏也就不再一一敘述了。　　大槪說來，夫子廟的清唱生意比全國任何地方都要發達一些，這原因自然是由於南京沒有公開的娼寮，沒有跳舞廳，而且不准抽大烟，不准賭博，一切不正當娛樂在這裏都是被禁止的，而一時又沒有別種適當的娛樂可以代替，於是住在這兒的人們便只好捧歌女消遣悠長的時日了。所以到這兒來的有小巿民，有商，有學生，有公務員，有軍人（大都穿便衣），有紈袴子弟，有官僚。尤其是公務員最多，因為他們下了辦公室，贏得一身的疲乏，無法排遣，便祇要到夫子廟各茶社巡禮一次，就可以發現許多掛證章，着半節制服的公務員的。　　這兒的捧塲方式，除了怪聲呌好外，便是贈送彩聯，花籃或銀盾，至於掛牌點戲是被政府禁止了的。在喊好中往往容易發生衝突，口角固是常事，有時甚至還要演一幕全武行。因為有些人喊好是有目的，同一姑娘又被别人喊好，便認為有傷「尊顔」而大發醋勁了。　　這兒清唱茶社臺面的佈置，比上海的「天仙」和「小廣寒」都要漂亮一些，招待主面也比較周到。泡了茶，衣帽各物都由茶房掛號收檢，臨走交代得清清楚楚，很少有什麽錯誤的，同時每個歌女的芳名及所唱的戲目，在未開塲之前也早已編定次序寫在大的本牌上，臨唱時又一個小木牌掛在臺口，這比之上海不標戲名要清楚得多。還有不同的，上海的清唱全是生角壓臺，而且必需有個大面，在南京則青衣壓臺的很多，各茶社都沒有大面，可見地方不同，聽眾的口味也有分別了。　　這些歌女名雖　歌，其實有許多歌女她們主要的目的是在賣肉，不過借着登臺的機會，以廣招徠罷了。在娼禁未　前她們不敢公開客，因此生意上很受打擊（妓女到客人處住夜，妓女受罰，反之則客人受罰）。然而蠅營狗偷之事却也難免，她們常常改變裝束，到旅館會客人，或是到醫院借看病為名，其實是同客人幽會，在南京就有許多專門假充醫館來做這種投機生意的塲所的！　　假如她們單是　歌，那也許不能維持生活，因為一個普通的歌女，每月不過從茶社分得一二十元，除了買自己身上的裝飾品外，還要養活家里的人，那能够呢？同時如果不賣肉體，也不會有人捧塲了。所以夫子廟雖是一個「歌巿」，實在也是個人肉巿塲，這兒充滿着肉的芳香，色的艷膩，聲的誘惑，到這兒來的人們，說不上眞正的娛樂，無非是找尋刺戟罷了。畫報春秋評「怎樣訓練你自己」  自清　　——長城書局發行，每册定價八角——　　目前的時代是苦悶的時代：多數青年都因為生活窮苦，前途渺茫，職業問題，求知問題以及婚姻問題等不能解決，可以說終日都在苦悶中。這羣苦悶者，當此整個的社會運動，民族運動尚未展開的時候，他們底一切精力都是集中在個人問題的解決上的；許多大的社會問題他們此時都不願過問。於是，應着他們這種要求，在出版界中便出現了許多關於個人修養的書物。但是在這一類的書籍中，却不見得每一本都眞正有益於讀者；反之，有許多關於個人修養的書籍，不管其作者吹了好大的牛皮，不管其廣告說得如何的漂亮，但其內容仍是非常卑下，庸俗，沒有用處的。這里所要評論的「怎樣訓練你自己」便是其中之一種。　　「怎樣訓練你自己」的作者美人維謙·依佛雷·洛德，據說是一位著名的敎育家。在書的「卷頭語」中也說這一眞是「本帮助人們成功的書」，要我們照着書中所說的一切做去。但是，我們看完這書之後，除得到一些幾乎是誰都知道的關於許多技術問題的常識外，便只有一些荒謬之談和庸俗的非一般青年所能應用的方法；至於進步的理論，眞正有益於個人和社會的見解，在這裏是找不着的。事實上，這書的主旨是要敎人如何生活如何做事才能獲得大的效率；在這中間作者舉出了四個原則：就是「知識」，「審度」，「决斷」，「力量」；依他看來，一個人做事要有效率，要走上成功之路，便有效率，要走上成功之路，便必須要有知識，善審度，能決斷，有力量。這可說是誰都知道的一種常識；所謂「知識」，「審度」，「决斷」與「力量」的重要，實在無須「敎育家」多費鉛墨來解說。我們以為問題不在於「知識」，「審度」，「决斷」與「力量」的重要，而是在於生活在現代的人主要的應該具備怎樣的知識，應該怎樣去認識，審度並决斷一切問題，應該把自己的力量主要的用於什麽事情之上。但是，「怎樣訓練你自己」所表現的，却是從各方面去說明「知識」，「審度」，「决斷」與「力量」的重要，並未更進一步去實際地闡明問題；而且，就是在其解說「知識」等等的重要並如何獲得牠們時，也是非常技術的，不深刻的。　　書的開始，第一章就提出了「自己訓練是一種什麽科學」的問題。在這裏作者首先就告訴我們做事要有條理，這不又是誰都知道的事情嗎？接着「敎育家」又解說效率的意義，在這中間他用了很多篇幅舉了很多事實來證明近代的許多生產技術和做事的方法比過去的要有效率得多，然而，這件事情誰不知道呢？「敎育家」在此實在沒有向我們提出新而有用的意見。　　接着，「敎育家」在書中即提出了「自己訓練的四個根本原則」，並說明了這些原則的重要，更分了十幾章來分論這四個原則。就表面看來倒好像是說得很詳細的，但說細並不見得就很正確，量多不一定就有。事實上。他雖用了三章的地位來解說「知識」，但在其中仍未具體指出在目前的世界上什麽知識是最有用的，以及如何去探求那知識；他只是庸俗地提出知識的三個條件：「研究」，「記憶」，「記錄」。自然，在這中間也未始沒有在大體上還可說吉姆有問題的意見，如作者指出研究要虛心，要取批評的態度，要適合於自己的知識程度等等。但這只是一些原則；如果這些原則沒有具體的正確的充實的內容，那仍是沒有用處的；而他所提出的原則便是沒有具體的正確的內容的一些公論。至於他所提出的一引起所謂實際辦法，大多是我們所不能實行的，機械的。譬如，他在敎人試騐觀察時，便提出了這樣機械的方法：　　「（一）將你服務所在那個辦公處的建築物的外觀盡量描寫出來。一篇敘述該建築物外觀的文章旣很細心地做成之後，再走到外面去看看，這時候，你會看出許多地方是你一向不曾觀察到。　　「（二）將你熟悉的親友當中的一人，用準確的文章去描寫他出來，再等到有機　，便把你所描寫的和那個本人比較下，我相信你一比較起來，你亦會發覺你的觀察竟差漏了不少。　　「（三）你試走到一個堆滿各種貨物的窗櫃之前，駐足片刻，觀察一下。離去那窗櫃之後，就把在窗櫃中所見到各種貨品記錄出來。再走到窗櫃之前，寫出你漏了沒有記錄的貨品。　　「…………………」　　我想，假使不是第一流的文學作家，　不管他有怎樣好　　　　　　　　以下接第五版雜作友情  龔子久　　假使世上有友情的話，我想友情確實是一件彌可珍貴的物事了。因為我始終沒有得到過友情的溫熱，雖然我是這樣謹愼的尋覓了這許多年頭。　　除非世上是根本沒有所謂友情。　　我是懐着一顆天眞的熱烈的心罔然踏上世途，我是深切的盼望着將我這一顆天眞的忠誠的心，奉獻　　「　　　誠的心待　的同伴，可是人家老是將我的心　入　　，　　　　　　　我誠迷信友情，所以我像乞丐一般要求人家　吝施捨他們的友情，可是施主們給我的是什麽呢？給我的是痛苦，給我的是憤怒。　　在或一時候，奸詐之霧像虹彩似的假着友情的外衣閃耀了，同時它又睜着貪慾的眼，現着微笑的臉，逗着我親近了。雖然我永遠不能從它的外衣上聞到友情的氣息，心靈的共鳴，可是我還是努力的想找尋我的眞正的友情，我依然貢獻着我這顆赤烈的心。時候過了，它一切所要利用於我的，完全無用了，它重新露出它那猙獰　獠牙，脫去了那一件虛偽的外衣，還了它奸昨的　來面目！　　　　人以相　　　　有利害的關係，沒　　的心之感應。因為大家所見的只有利和害，就永遠矯揉造作，永遠玩弄手腕，在一切交接上，都要如列國間的縱橫裨　，各盡各的奸詐的能事。詐，一切都是詐，現世還沒有兩個人都能披赤誠以相見。友，就是敵的假音。　　我太寂寞了，我的心太創痛了。我在二十多個年頭中，受了多少次虛偽的友情的欺詐？我有時候眞感到連我「箋尊嚴」也被剝蝕了！　　從此，我將永遠寂寞的踴躍的　着邊漫　的世途，我　閉了我的眼睛，不相陳那些永遠以利害來，　　　　眞的心靈手！阿門！</p>

<p>的觀察力，也不能將一所　　物或一個人如　　活現岀來的。至於記錄堆在窗櫃里的貨物，那更是猜啞謎的辦法，沒有什麽大的用　。而且，就是這樣機械愚笨的方法也不是一般靑年所能實行，因爲他們沒有閒，也不會那麽發痴；能够那樣去做的恐怕只有有錢有閒的人，　這些人又絕不會自尋苦惱去幹那些笨事。因此，「敎育家」這些辦法雖很「實際」，但却是落了空的。　　此外，關於求知識的另兩個倏件，「記憶」，「記錄」，也很平庸；而且作者的解釋也不深刻，有些地方甚至離開題目大談了一些零碎的技術事情，以圖多堆積一些詞句。譬如在「記　　　作者就由紀錄」　一字　　　　方　　　　　一私人用費的記載上去了，但這一些却不是解釋如何求有用的知一　的主要內容。　　假使要談這書的主要特點的話，那除了說它是技術地表面地研究外，我們還可以指出牠是進備給與那些想發洋財的人看的，實在，齊中各處所講的都是敎人如何弄錢，如何爬到上層去。這里我們且隨便引出書中的一段文字來看吧！　　「諸位要像一個在商業里面的人，具有你擢升的計劃，要注意到所必須經過的步驟。當你忠心地做着你職守上所有的本務之時，你儘可把一級的他　　　　　　　，研究　　，　　也要訓練到你　己能够　負這些資任。那就是運甩明達了。」　　此外，如敎人如何爬上銀行總裁或商店總經理的地位，如何增加自己納收入等論調還很多，不能一一列舉。但是，在這經濟恐慌日益發展的年頭兒里，一切生產都在向下，多數人的生活地位都在降低，一般苦悶的靑年即使　很勤苦，善於訓練自己，恐怕也不容易爬上去吧。至於那些已經居於高位的人，關於如何更向上爬的知識，我敢說一定比「敎育家」還要豐富的；「敎育家」的「怎樣訓練你目己」對於他們簡直是「敎猱昇木」了！業餘咖啡座見機而作  魯君平　　事要做得圓活，話要說得漂亮，庶幾事無鉅細，話無多少，决沒有碰壁衝突之事，而且還可得處處逢源之利呢！　　識時務者爲俊傑，這一句話在晚近來已濫觴於朝野問；所以聰明幹練者處理事務，沒有不見機而作的。交壇上有所謂「莫談國事，只談風月」的警告，政治舞臺起了風浪時，報章上有所謂「某巨公靜觀時局變化，不願發表意見，」「某將軍態度未明」等新聞，洋塲上小浪人打架，看淸眼線，乘機在人堆裏送一拳，溜之大吉，或看見　亮小女入踽踽獨行，見是有機可乘，不妨也來「那個」一下。這種種，無非識時務的俊傑之所爲，而亦是「見機而作」的表現。　　寫到這裏，我記起幼年時熟知的故事來了。故事說：某大地主的收租人李某每年至張三家收租，張三必欵以烹調鮮美的鮮鷄全只，如是者數年，習以爲常。奈時過境遷，比年來年荒人亂，相逼而來，因是張三的家道已大不如前。曾李某來索租，張三雖仍欵以飯食，但雄鷄一只，價亦須一元左右，張三爲節省起見，擬將此例規革除之。李某見酒已數巡，尚未見鷄上來，大不悅，乃吟歪詩曰：「年年收租必有鷄，今年收租却無鷄，此田不與張三種，——」吟未畢，張三大恐，忙下廚囑妻縛活鷄奉客。李某見之，乃續吟曰：「不與張三却與誰？」張三於是哈哈大笑，謂李某曰：「李先生念的詩，爲什麽前言後語竟判若兩人呢？」李某笑曰：前三句叫做「無稽（鷄之諧音）之談」，後一句却是一見機（亦鷄之諧音）而作。」張三默然。李某挾鷄而歸。這故事謔且虐，但當今世人之見鷄而異其言辭，異其行爲的，滔滔者天下皆是也。　　今日見某老在平對新聞記者談黃河水災，他老人家不悲天不憫人，也不質怪人治水不力，防患未然，而却恨恨說夏禹是個投機分子，沒有把水治好，以至今日爲害無窮。夏禹是否投機分子，吾人暫且不論，但今之要人權貴是不大好說話的，只得駡駡四千年來的腐屍夏禹氏，比較上也算「見機而作」了。　　又一年以前在某處曾緝獲烟土百箱，當將人土一併扣留，此巨大運土案，曾轟動遐邇，翌日，忽據說此箱中物經某處騐知並非烟土，已將人箱一併釋放，各報以事出離奇，競相登載。可是這一伴公案事關天機，吾人實不能判定其爲「無稽之談」呢，還是「見機而作」了？賣老  琳　　「大觀園」裏鳳姐怨恨道：「…可惜我小幾歲年紀，若早生二三十年，如今這些老人家也不薄我沒見世面了。「風波」中的九斤太太也正拿了破芭蕉敲着凳脚，大怒道：「我活到七十九歲了，活够了，不願意眼見這些敗家相——還是死的好，立刻就要吃飯了，還吃炒豆子，吃窮了一家子！」可見賣老不自今日始，女人小子也得賣老；能眞老的，當然可以「倚老賣老」。　　至如國內生了事端，就非賣一會老不可了：三老通電，二老宣言，還有什麽「元老」之類南北奔走，小民看時局的變化，只要看那些政治老人是膽有動作。　　文人著作若經××老人之類的老人品題一次，包管洛陽紙貴，風行全國，是故賣老在登龍術中也應佔上一席地的。　　再說，××××的主席，非「年高德劭」的老兒却沒有資格任××××之職的，查憲法草第五十六條：「××委員會委員及候補委員應具左列資格，（一）年齡在四十五歲以上者……」這不是更値得大書特書的嗎？　　賣老的方式雖然各各不同，但决不受時空的制限的。如遠在南海之濱的廣州曾舉行全市耆英大會，貴爲市長的劉先生竟與羣老排排坐，吃窩窩，拍小照。又如久蟄北平的賽金花，居然有新聞記者像訪問黨國名流一樣的訪問她了，這正因爲「白頭宮女在，閒坐說玄宗」，老人總是値得注意的。再如楊小樓年紀雖老，出塲上演時，尤多人看，看的人說：「再不看，要沒得看了。」　　前一時有些人說「先殺盡中國的老人，中國才有救。」這話不懂到底是什麽意思，難道「老」還不够好？或「賣老」已失了威風嗎？專述華僑在全世界（十）（一）  鍾民誼　　在美華僑以廣東人居多，其分佈地帶和人數如下：　　紐約　一五·〇〇〇人　波士頓　二·〇〇〇人　　費內得爾菲亞　一·五〇〇　新托利斯　六〇〇人　　芝加哥　約三·〇〇〇人　密士西比河沿岸　二·〇〇〇人　　此外，在太平洋沿岸，如舊金山西雅圖等處亦有很多的華僑。　　這些華僑的職業，主要的是販賣商人，洗衣工人，鑛工，裁縫，農民，茶役，侍者。他們在許多地方都保持着舊有的中國風味。有名的「唐人街」卽是華僑會合之地，但在這街上，不僅許多商店的形式是中國式的，而且住在這兒的華僑的生活習慣，也有許多地方還保持着所謂中國人的不良習慣。如不好整潔，喜飲愛吃，賭博遊蕩等現象，在這裏都充分地表現了出來；尤其是賭博，可說是這里華僑的普遍嗜好，什麽牌九，銀牌，麻雀，在這里都應有盡有。因此，許多僑胞由於「睹運不亨」，常打敗戰，以致勞苦一生，終於是囊空如洗；當然其中也有少數「運氣好」的，因賭而大發洋財，成爲富家翁了。不過，近來像</p>

<p>紐約的「　人　」，　　　　比較好了，僑胞己逐　改　了　不良習慣，如　　　　續進步，那對於　們的前途必然是有更多的帮助的。　　墨西哥　在美　以南，美洲僑人數漸少，但在墨西哥的華僑却是較多的。據一九一〇年的統計，墨西哥就有一萬三千二百人；及至一九三一年已增至將近兩萬人了。本來，依據一八九九年的中墨通商條約，兩國，民皆有相互旅行及居住之自由，得經營工商業，並受最惠國條欵之待遇。但近來墨西哥各地方政府和一部份人民對於華僑則多方排斥，禁止中墨人通婚，取消華僑向來在墨之權利，使我兩三萬在墨僑胞大受痛苦。說來實在令人浩歎！　　加拿大　加拿大在美國的北面，是英國五大子國之一。在一八九八年時，在美洲的華僑，因聞卑西發現金鑛，卽有許多人到加拿大去。及至一八七零年，因加拿大開發金鑛和修築鐵路，急需人力，所以當時在澳洲在美國和別的地方的華人前往者更多。但是不久加拿大國會議員見於所謂蒙古人種入境日多，於一八八六年卽决定實行向華人徵收人頭稅，每人五十元；一九零一年人頭稅又增至每人百元；一九零四年更增至每人五百元；隨後更絕對禁止華工入境，自是在加拿大的華僑人數，便沒有什麽增加了。但據一九一一年的調查，全加華僑仍有二萬七千七百七十四人。其中以工人最多，商人學生較少。在這里有幾個中華會館和華僑學校。有華工的組合，其組織很好，團集力也很强；華工之尚能在加拿大維持相當地位者，我們不能不說是因爲他們有很鞏固的組合的緣故。　　中美　在中美的巴拿馬，危地馬拉，哥斯大利加等國，都有很多華僑。其中以工人最多，商人次之。但一般說來，在中美的華僑的經濟情形都較佳。在巴拿馬者，有俱樂部和圖書館，華僑們相互的感情和對祖國的觀念都很好，他們與當地人士很少往來。更少通婚。危地瑪拉的華僑則稍有不同，他們愛與當地人接近，並娶當地女子為妻。　　在中美華僑，亦遭受排拆，如巴拿馬之禁止中國人和土耳其人入境，便是顯明的例症。（未完）播音節目特別節目　　微聲播音團　　友聯（八八〇）上午十時半至十一時半　　金與銀（戴曼如）値千金（　　）快樂銅匠（屈惠康（女神舞（胡溯帆）跳舞室之　（戴曼如）Aloma（朱翼）沙漢商隊（屈惠康）雙頭之鷹（胡溯帆）卡門（屈惠康）囚籠一鳥（朱翼）愛之古巢（戴曼如）　　大上海社　　惠靈（一三八〇）上午十時半至十一時半　　My　Darling（前奏曲）路柳墙花（飛亞）芭蕉葉詩（琳琍）回憶（雯仙）飛虹歌（飛虹）天倫之愛（王瑛）塞外村女（飛亞）關外高歌（琳琍）月下花前（雯仙）睡的贊美（飛虹）離別姑娘（王蝶）Ha—cha—cha（後奏曲）　　中國兒童文化恊會　　新新（七八〇）中午十二時至一時　　（一）張友鑑先生報吿及講「不聽話的雄鷄」故事，（二）普志小學小朋友唱「新生活運動歌」「童子軍歌」，「挺進曲」，「娘子軍歌」，（三）時華小學小朋友唱「母親」等歌，（四）華光口琴隊吹奏「卡門」「勇往直前」兩曲。　　晨鐘口琴隊　　華東（一三六〇）下午一時至二時　　石人望敎授（標準口琴吹奏法）（半小時）有格利利獨奏（卡爾氏先生）聯盟進行曲（二重奏）（劉逸）（高濬生）拿破崙進行曲（手風琴提琴合奏）、（馬維元）（馬維理）喀不律之小島（沈濂）紙鳶圓舞曲（劉逸）阿　廷美人（二重奏）（葛朝祉）（高濬生）　　其美飛虹落伍業餘社　　安定（八六〇）下午二時至四時　　劍鋒之下（張　）愛向何處尋（汪葉）戀愛明星（黎明）城市之光（麗霞）一封快信（張　）風雨歸舟（黎明）南海美人（麗霞）淸早起來（汪葉）　　「落伍社口琴節目及其美歌曲臨時發表」　　大風口琴社　　李樹德（九四〇）下午二時半至三時　　夢想行進曲（張承沛）牧　短笛（二重奏）（孔亞靑，文華）Youth　March（張承沛）卡門（文華）風流　婦（嚴昌緒）快樂之鐘（包芳芸）　　大華口琴隊　　安定（八六〇）下午三時至四時　　獨奏Yoimachigusa（短音階）船歌（短音階）行軍進行曲（半音口琴）二重奏理想（序曲）加伏脫（舞曲）合爽夜樂（夜曲）FataMaldofperb（序曲）　　中華口翠隊　　新新（七八〇）下午三時一刻至四時　　「天堂與地獄」（陳明女士劉紅英女士）多情少年（陸荷淸）湖畔明月（大合奏）落磯山之春（羅蜉弱）漢宮秋月（大合奏）甲探戈『　薇」（短音階長音階併用爵士卡爾奏法）（王慶隆）二個戀人（王慶隆）瀋陽月（大合奏）　　中華兒童故事播音社　　永生（一〇八〇）下午五時至五時半　　「今年是咱們的」杜也牧先生講　　（本故事用上海音播送，內容精彩曲折，能够抓着每一個孩子的心的癢處，激發億萬兒童向上的精神。）　　稚鳴社　　交通（一三〇〇）下午五時至六時　　舞伴情歌（前奏曲）光明之路（陳萍）賣報歌（瑛瑛）賣油條（璐玲）賣花詞（珂玲）愛的　（王瑛）愛情是什麽（陳萍）夜花園裏（璐玲）紅玫瑰舞（珂玲）從軍別愛（柴瑟）西宮詞（埃娜（雙搖舟）莉茜努力（兪徵）櫊樓上的小姐（莉玲）　　黎明口琴團　　華僑（七〇〇）下午五時至六時　　懊鄕圓舞曲（戴曼如）體操進行曲（嚴昌緒）多諾河流水（張寒）愛之古巢（祝劍白）人郎琪將軍進行（二重奏）（戴曼如）（張寒）MyDaring（嚴昌緒）滑稽曲（戴曼如）日出進行曲（黃　）天國與地獄（二重奏）（戴曼如）（張寒）凡倫西雅（祝劍白）異歌情調（戴曼如）女神舞（嚴昌緒）　　時代歌劇播音社　　佛音（九八〇）下午六時三刻至七時一刻　　吹泡泡（芳　）娘子軍（葉紅）我們的皇后（葉紅）小夜曲（叔牙）妹妹怪你（葉英）　　水滸　　林冲被高俅用盡了計謀把他陷害入獄，買通了禁子想把他害死，而林冲命不該絕，最後終於被逼上梁山水泊…　　都會社　　華興（一二六〇）下午八時至八時三刻　　擱樓上的小姐（珍妮自殺尚未成功（靜韻）睡的贊美（若蘭）薔薇之歌（孫曼）愛情如玫瑰（笙韻）靑春之樂（若蕙）鸞鳳引（虹瑛）畢業歌（全體）　　中國紅十字會籌募水災賬欵　　佛音（九八〇）下午八時一刻起　　韓蘭根先生（播唱滑稽歌曲揚美寶小姐（燕雙飛）蝶戀花（蘇武牧羊）馮韻芬小姐（花　　　）（　　）（　　　）　　　　　　　　　见　　漁光曲）、　漸深　　芳小姐（蘇三不要哭）（小　哥）永别了我的弟弟）杨美芳小姐（可憐的秋香）（賣花词）（鳳陽歌）電影消息歌舞團秘聞龔秋霞大鬧後台　　原來是「父母子女」中的一場戲　　近年來因經濟恐慌日益嚴重，雖紙迷金醉之歌舞團亦不免受市面不景氣之影響，而發生解散風潮，數日前海上某大戲院聘請某某歌舞團登臺表演，公演數日，賣座日衰，戲院經理及該歌舞團領班某女士深憂之；一日，領班某女士忽利令智昏，命全體女演員週身塗以銀粉，表演「銀色裸像」，以致引起全體演員之反感，該團女主角龔秋霞小姐反對尤力，並向領班某女士曉以大義，領班不但為所動，反出口傷人，遂激起公憤，龔秋霞亦不能耐，嚴詞申斥道：「我們爲了衣食而犧牲了靑春的幸福，但是我們沒有犧牲人格，……歌舞本是很高尚的藝術，都是給你們這班弄糟了，……像這樣，我們任可餓死，也不幹了……」一塲衝奪，結果，龔　霞及一羣鶯鶯燕燕的女演員，送皆紛紛脫離後台，領　某女士　懾於衆威，弄巧成拙，祗有徒　奈何而已，欲知詳細情形如何？請閱文化影業公司有聲處女作「父母子女」，按龔秋霞小姐本我國最負盛譽之歌舞名家，此次在「父母子女」飾一因遭天災人禍而入歌　團之被壓迫女子，假戲眞做，眞戲假做，故演出甚為深刻動人？　　介紹　唐　租「童男子」合編的「電影藝術」，創刊號聞將於本月下旬出版，本社執筆者有，蔡楚住，孫師毅，鄭應時，唐納，姚蘇鳳，沈西苓，小洛，靈　，塵無等，漫畫爲胡宇及張光宇設計，封面爲美的的母鳥三色版，內容分馬上閑話，影壇春秋，影塲夜話等，沒有忘了「生生的咖啡」的讀者，請留意着這「大膽」的刊物的誕生罷。勞萊哈台新片「從軍樂」  南京將映</p>

<p>(Nanking) The following is the translated text of the congratulatory speech given by German Ambassador Trautmann to Chairman Lin when presenting his credentials: "Your Excellency, Chairman of the National Government, I am deeply honored to present to Your Excellency the credentials accrediting me as Ambassador to China, entrusted to me by the Chancellor of the Reich. The decision of the Chinese and German governments to elevate the status of their respective envoys is a joyous event in the relations between the Chinese and German peoples. Through this measure, both nations expect to further deepen the friendly relations that have long been deeply ingrained in the minds of both peoples. Having previously had the honor of serving as Minister to China for four years, I have had ample opportunity to appreciate the friendship of the Chinese people towards Germany. At the same time, I can confidently assert that Germany deeply sympathizes with the Chinese government's endeavors to build and develop its domestic political and economic relations, and Germany has always expressed its admiration. This is also evident in the vibrant spiritual and economic ties between the Chinese and German peoples, which are developing with mutual benefit as their goal. I am greatly honored to be appointed as the first Ambassador to China from my country. Furthermore, my government is extremely pleased to move the embassy to Nanjing on this very day. In the future, serving in this prosperous new capital, I will seize every opportunity to continue to enhance the friendly relations between our two countries. I sincerely hope that in carrying out this important mission, I may receive your Excellency's kind assistance. I respectfully wish you good health and longevity, and prosperity to the Republic of China." The following is Chairman Lin's response after receiving the credentials of the German Ambassador: "Your Excellency, Ambassador, I am delighted to accept the credentials you have presented today as the Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary of Germany to the Republic of China, entrusted to you by the Chancellor of your country. The elevation of the status of envoys between China and Germany is a clear demonstration of our mutual friendship and is a cause for celebration. Your Excellency has previously served as Minister representing your country in this nation for four years, and is well-versed in the vibrant spiritual and economic ties between the Chinese and German peoples, and has worked tirelessly to promote friendly relations. Now that you have been honored as the first Ambassador of Germany to China, I am even more confident that the amicable relations between our two countries will become even closer in the future. Moreover, your government has moved the embassy to Nanjing on the very day that Your Excellency presented your credentials, making it easier to provide assistance so that Your Excellency can accomplish your mission. I sincerely wish the Chancellor of your country good health and longevity, and prosperity to your country." (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

<p>(Nanjing) German Ambassador Trautmann hosted members of the press in the capital at the embassy at 4:00 p.m. on the 14th. More than thirty people attended. Ambassador Trautmann hosted and delivered a speech, stating that the relations between China and Germany have always been friendly. Today, he presented his credentials to Your Excellency, the Chairman of your country. In the credentials, the Chancellor of my country, Hitler, stated that the elevation of the embassy's status is intended to demonstrate to all countries in the world the friendly feelings of my country towards your country. He has been appointed as the first Ambassador to China, and he sincerely hopes that the decision to elevate the embassy's status will be sufficient to create one of the most pleasant pages in the relations between the two nations. He also hopes to evolve the relations between the two countries on the basis of mutual respect and equality. This foundation has already been successfully established and has already enabled both sides to tacitly believe in each other in order to promote further friendship between the two countries in political and economic terms. Since the announcement of the embassy's elevation in status, my government has decided to move the embassy in Peiping to your country's capital. He has now moved here, and most of the embassy staff have also come south one after another. His colleagues at the embassy are convinced that this move will win the sympathy of your people and will also allow them to have personal access to the officials of your government at any time. He has been ordered to formally inform your country's Chairman of the move of the embassy to the south. Furthermore, the people of his country increasingly admire your country's successful construction in various fields. Past political difficulties and natural disasters have never diminished the efforts and determination of your country's leaders and great people in construction. Although his country has experienced political and global economic crises, various constructions have also achieved remarkable success under the leadership of Chancellor Hitler. He now extends his most sincere congratulations to the people of your country for their victory and conveys the deepest sympathy of his country. After the speech, a photograph was taken, and the event was adjourned. At 8:00 p.m., President Wang hosted a banquet for Trautmann and the embassy staff at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, inviting the heads of various Yuan, ministries, and commissions in the capital, as well as the directors, counselors, and secretaries of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, to accompany them.

The reason for the drop in water level is that the embankments in Tongpi, Feng, and Pei counties have collapsed in many places, and the water has spread out. At the same time, the disaster area has increased without decreasing. (Central News Agency dispatch, 14th)</p>

Its function is still to follow the normal flow into the Canal and does not block the incoming water. Moreover, because the dam diverts water into the Liutang and other rivers into the sea, it has the benefit of rapid flood discharge. Shao has understood. (Special dispatch, 14th)</p>

<h3>Recent Trends in British World Market</h3>
<p>— Hua</p>
<p>Recently, the London "Financial News" published a summary of British foreign trade for the first half of this year. There are several facts worth noting by those who pay attention to British diplomatic trends. First, the total value of British foreign trade in the first half of this year has increased compared to the same period in 1934 and 1933. Among them, trade between the British mainland and its colonies has increased in both imports and exports. Trade between Britain and other countries has decreased in imports but slightly increased in exports. Second, the distribution of British exports in various aspects of the world market in the first half of this year has increased the most in Africa. In Europe, it has increased for the pound bloc countries in Northern Europe, as well as Germany and Poland, while it has decreased for gold standard countries such as the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, and Italy. In Asia, exports to Japan have increased while exports to China have decreased. In South America, it has increased for Argentina, Chile, and Colombia, while it has decreased for Brazil, Peru, and Uruguay.</p>
<p>From the above results, we can see that the policy of imperial trade unity implemented by Britain in recent years has achieved considerable success, but the struggle of British exports in the world market has seen both gains and losses and has not achieved complete victory. Currently, the United States and Japan are competing with Britain in the world market. In particular, Osaka and Lancashire are almost irreconcilable in the export competition of cotton textiles. British cotton textiles originally regarded Africa, Asia, and Latin America as the main markets. However, in recent years, Japanese cotton textiles have been advancing in all directions with low-priced dumping, gradually causing Lancashire products to feel a serious threat. Britain has been struggling to the best of its ability and has managed to maintain its original advantage in the African market. However, in Asia and South America, the dumping of Japanese goods has become unstoppable. Although British exports to Japan have shown an increase due to a large amount of machinery, metal raw materials, and military supplies, exports to China have inevitably declined due to the capture of the cotton textile market.</p>
<p>According to the Japanese newspaper in Shanghai on August 30, Japan ranked first in cotton textile exports to China in July, and Britain ranked second. In the entire cotton textile market in China, Japan accounted for 52.39%, Britain accounted for 40.82%, and the remaining 6.79% belonged to third parties. The sales of British goods seem to be gradually concentrated in one corner of Shanghai, while Japanese goods have a rapid advancement in all aspects. Sir Frederick Leith-Ross, the British financial expert sent to China, is currently in Tokyo negotiating with Japanese authorities. It is said that the market issue is also one of the matters to be discussed, so the above report should be timely reference material. Britain and Japan have formed a confrontation in the world market. In the current negotiations, will this market issue be a factor promoting compromise, or will it be an obstacle causing a breakdown? It is indeed worth pondering.</p>
<h3>Hitler Tells German Youth: Strengthen Body and Mind to Share Hardships, Discipline is the Special Trait of Germans, Purpose is Only to Secure Internally and Defend Externally</h3>
<p>Nuremberg: At 10:15 this morning, Premier Hitler delivered a speech to 50,000 members of the Hitler Youth and the German Women's League at the Nuremberg Sports Ground. It was a magnificent sight. The audience unanimously gave the Nazi salute to Hitler and cheered loudly. After a brief welcome speech by the leader of the German Youth League, Hitler declared that German youth are progressing year by year in terms of quantity and quality, and the effectiveness of the silver chain of national discipline and physique is also becoming increasingly significant. The youth of our country today no longer indulge in wild drinking and labor, nor are they proud of enjoying pleasure, but are capable of running races and winning. The ideal of the German people today is to give equal importance to male and female personalities, strong in body and mind, comparable to steel. The implementation of new training starts from youth and has no end. We hope that this spirit will penetrate the hearts of young people, and only with this spirit can we guarantee our future security. However, if there is no leader above and no obedience below, then nothing will be accomplished. After we have exercised physical fitness and understood obedience, the second arduous task is now at hand. The people of the whole country must be trained so that when one person gives an order, everyone will follow it, because they will have the opportunity to lead others in the future. A powerful government is based on this principle. We have learned discipline since childhood. Other countries may not understand this, but this will not stop us. If other countries do not recognize the purpose of this discipline, it is not our fault. We are determined not to cause chaos. The disputes we cause are actually fewer than those caused by democratic countries. We control our own destiny and want to carry out our plans without being hindered. We do not want to hinder others, nor do we want others to hinder us. This is the only condition for our love of peace. We firmly believe that only the strong can gain friendship. We must be strong so that we can be understood. We do not want to be a second-rate country, but want to be among the first-rate powers. This aspiration must be fulfilled and it is your responsibility. (14th National Telegram)</p>
<p>Nuremberg: Chief Hitler addressed 150,000 representatives of the National Socialist Party today, saying that he was extremely gratified to meet with the gentlemen who had struggled together in the past. We look forward to the future and hope to recognize the route and not forget the process of creating today's status. This conference should be a lesson for those who want to distinguish the leader from his followers. I do not want to be a general without an army, but I want to be your leader. The struggle has not yet succeeded, but has entered the second stage of the struggle, which is to continue to educate and supervise the people, so that they will gradually accept National Socialism and prevent any degradation or decadence. If our enemies think that they can still sit and wait for the decline of the National Socialist movement, then I will tell them that they have not yet seen its beginning. At the beginning of our struggle, we set firm principles, and we will never slacken in the future. Regarding the militia, Hitler said that Germany does not want to anesthetize the youth of the whole country with militarism, but will make the youth of the whole country honest and courteous citizens, and they will be happy to fight for national freedom in the event of national disaster in the future.

<p>Nuremberg: Propaganda Minister Goebbels delivered a speech to the crowded masses in the conference hall today, criticizing communism with no effort spared, saying that in early August this year, a major British newspaper published an article titled "Two Dictators," intending to clarify that German National Socialism and Soviet Russian communism are actually the same thing, saying that the opposite signs of National Socialism and communism are placed above the political system, but the structure of these governments is actually similar, their laws are also very similar, and both governments consistently examine art, literature, and newspapers, consistently attack reason and religion, and consistently flaunt their power. If the issue discussed in the article is not related to political phenomena, then we should not pay attention to it, but this political phenomenon is not insignificant regarding the future of Europe. International communism hopes to eliminate all natural national and racial characteristics, while National Socialism regards private property, national personality, and racial ideology as the driving force for promoting any civilization. Goebbels then elaborated on Soviet Russian communism, especially highlighting the power of the Jews, saying that this is not a social experiment, but only a large-scale attempt by the Jews to eliminate the Aryan ruling class of all countries in the world and replace it with a Jewish hell. This attempt seizes and maintains its power by cruel means, so it will eventually encounter cruel retribution. As far as our Germany is concerned, it has already been completely conquered. Hitler's great achievements for all mankind may stand alone on the German mission, and the great dike he built to prevent communism will eventually prevent the Jewish influx. History will one day recognize that Germany was saved by Hitler's salvation and avoided moral decay, and Western civilization was spared a catastrophe because of Germany's self-rescue.

<h3>Singapore Chinese Businessmen Meet to Deal with Dutch-Indian Restriction Regulations</h3>
<p>(Singapore of Hualian News Agency) The Dutch East Indies pretext that the depression is becoming more and more serious in order to protect the interests of Dutch merchants, and promulgated regulations restricting the entry of foreign goods into Japan. Therefore, Singapore's goods are also subject to restricted imports. A few days ago, the Dutch Consul General in Singapore also issued a notice saying that the restriction on goods from Singapore is only for ironware. However, the actual situation is far from the truth. In addition to ironware, many other goods have also been refused entry. Therefore, the losses suffered by Chinese businessmen are extremely large, and Western businessmen have also been hit. A few days ago, the Singapore Chinese Chamber of Commerce specially convened Chaozhou Porcelain Guild, European and American General Merchandise Food Business Bureau, General Merchandise Color Wine Guild, Rattan Merchants' Association, Cloth Trade Business Bureau, Tea Merchants' Association, Yinghe Business Bureau, Nanyang Sago Guild, Fuhua General Merchandise Store, Rice Merchants' Association, Zhua Ya Suburb Business Bureau, Wine Merchants' Association, Tangyang General Merchandise Store, Sugar Merchants' Association, Haiyu Suburb Office, Chinese Machinery Store, Lumber Shipbuilding Guild, Beijing Fruit Business Store, Xishi Suburb Business Bureau, Singapore General Merchandise Store, Firewood Charcoal Merchants' Association, Jiangyuan Jinguo Xiangshan Three Suburb Committee, Soliciting Bribes Ironware Paint Guild, Rubber Guild, Yanghe Business Bureau, Siam Suburb Business Bureau, Annan Suburb Business Bureau, and other 37 groups to meet and discuss countermeasures. The results of the discussion were: (1) Efforts should be made to arouse the legal meaning of the local government, and the local government should be requested to directly ask the Dutch government to preserve the rights and interests of foreign merchants in transportation through international diplomatic procedures. (2) Western merchants should be invited to cooperate with our overseas Chinese and participate in the petition. (3) Local Legislative Council member Zheng Liande should be invited to represent our various business groups and explain the origin and purpose of the petition to the local government. If the purpose of improvement is not achieved, further action will be taken.</p>

<h3>Italian Cabinet Announces Preparation to Withdraw from the League of Nations; Mussolini Reports Intensified Military Advance; Still Seeks to Promote Amicable Relations with France</h3>
<p>(Rome) The government has just issued a communiqué stating, "The Italian Cabinet met this morning and considered under what circumstances Italy would no longer be able to attend Geneva. (Havas dispatch of the 14th) At 10 o'clock this morning, the Cabinet held a State Council meeting. Prime Minister Mussolini reported on the development of the military and political situation since the Cabinet meeting held in Bolzano on August 28th, stating, 'Our military preparations in East Africa are now being intensified because the Abyssinian army is large in number and has already begun to mobilize, which must be stopped. In addition, some residents of Italian Cyrenaica living abroad are quite alarmed. Therefore, the government has increased the coastal defense of Italian Libya. In short, the Italian army is now prepared to deal with any threat. General Dal'Olio, who served as the Director of the Military Supplies Bureau during the last World War, has been reappointed as the Director of the Military Supplies Bureau, ordering him to step up the production of various military supplies.'" Mussolini then commented on the establishment of the League of Nations' Five-Power Committee and the speeches of British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Prime Minister Laval at the League of Nations General Assembly, saying, "Judging from the policies of Britain and France regarding the League of Nations Covenant, the speeches of Hoare and Laval cannot be ignored. According to official reports, the Italian people are indifferent to these speeches. However, the Cabinet still welcomes the words of Laval's speech concerning the Rome-French Agreement and French-Italian friendship. Italy is determined to strengthen friendly relations with France, which is not only beneficial to France and Italy, but also conducive to European cooperation. The close friendship between France and Italy will certainly not be broken by colonial disputes. As for the so-called sanctions, conflicts have repeatedly arisen among member states of the League of Nations in the past, and their nature was even more serious, but there was no mention of implementing sanctions. How can sanctions be imposed on Italy now?" After Mussolini finished his report, the Cabinet members discussed whether Italy could continue to attend the League of Nations meetings. Finally, after the Cabinet learned of the various facts that foreign countries were using the Italian-Abyssinian dispute to engage in anti-fascist movements, it believed that the Cabinet should clearly state that a compromise solution was not enough to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, because Italy had made significant efforts and sacrifices to the League of Nations. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) A communiqué was issued here this afternoon, confirming Mussolini's determination to act alone to deal with the Abyssinian problem, and confirming that Italy is now planning to withdraw from the League of Nations. The meeting of the Italian Cabinet lasted two and a half hours to consider the situation caused by the Anglo-French declaration in Geneva. All cabinet members attended, chaired by Mussolini. It is reported that Mussolini gave the cabinet members a detailed report on the development of the military and political situation since the last cabinet meeting in Bolzano. Mussolini also announced that because the situation in Libya is unstable, reinforcements are going there to strengthen Italian military defenses. Mussolini also stated that Italy's land, sea, and air forces are sufficient to cope with any threat from any direction. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The speech given by French Prime Minister Laval at the League of Nations General Assembly was distinctly strong in nature, but public opinion here tonight has calmed down. The general impression is that Laval's barking is worse than his biting, and that Laval will not agree to join in any situation of complete sanctions. (Reuters dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The declaration of US Secretary of State Hull on the Italian-Abyssinian issue has aroused sighs from officials here. The speech of French Prime Minister Laval has also made officials here feel uneasy. However, it is reported that Mussolini will disregard economic, financial, and military sanctions and is determined to implement his plan for Abyssinia.

<p>(Geneva) The League of Nations Administrative Council held a secret meeting tonight to discuss Siam's request to obtain a semi-permanent council seat on the Administrative Council, but no resolution was reached. This matter will be discussed further at tomorrow's meeting. (Central News Agency dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) China's application for a seat on the League of Nations Administrative Council was discussed at a secret meeting of the Administrative Council today, but no resolution was reached. Because further consideration is needed, it was decided to hold another meeting to discuss it. It seems that this matter will not be submitted to this session of the League of Nations General Assembly, so it will be delayed for at least another year. British political circles deny the claim that Britain opposes China's request. Whether the matter is appropriate or not is set aside for the moment, but it must be ensured that China obtains a two-thirds majority of the League of Nations General Assembly regarding its qualifications and election before a decision can be made. If the Administrative Council suddenly decides to increase the number of council seats to fifteen, and China cannot obtain it stably, it will create an opportunity for those who covet this honor and enjoy the necessary support. (Reuters dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) It was learned tonight that the proposal to establish a special seat on the League of Nations Administrative Council to accommodate China has now been indefinitely shelved by the Administrative Council at a special meeting at 7:00 tonight. The meeting was held in secret. Several countries had expressed that even if this council seat were added, China might not be elected. (National News Agency dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<h3>New Party Movement in Japan; Membership May Reach Fifty or Sixty People</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The establishment of a new party is now possible, with Takahashi as president. The expelled members of the Seiyukai, such as Akita Kiyoshi, Nagashima Ryuji, Takanishi Masao, Tsusaki Hisatake, and Kishida Masaji, as well as Nakano's faction of the National Alliance and Tokonami's faction within the Seiyukai, may all participate. Therefore, with the establishment of a new party, the minimum number of members would be fifty or sixty. (United Press dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>US Trade with China Decreases</h3>
<p>(Washington) An official of the US Department of Commerce told a reporter for the Associated Press today that US exports to China will remain at the current level, pending an improvement in China's internal situation. China's economic panic is due to US silver policy, domestic financial turmoil, and floods. In the first six months of this year, US imports of Chinese goods increased by 26% compared to the same period last year, but US imports to China decreased by 40.3%. The predictions of silver experts have been contradicted. (National News Agency dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<h3>British and Italian Naval Activity in the Mediterranean; Two Warships in Hong Kong Are Also Preparing to Sail</h3>
<p>(Rome) Italian warships are currently engaged in exercises near Malta, and Britain is also engaging in naval armaments in the Mediterranean. Italy has become greatly alarmed, and the Coloniale, a mouthpiece of the Ministry of Colonies, published that Britain has added a ninth naval division to the Mediterranean fleet, and the British garrison has also been greatly increased. Offensive and defensive works in various ports have been repaired and strengthened. The bases in Gibraltar, Malta, Cyprus, Haifa, and Alexandria have all been prepared for offense and defense. Their weapons have reached the point of beginning to threaten the position of Italian forces in the Mediterranean and the Red Sea. Whenever a British naval detachment arrives in our waters, we must make arrangements to counter it. If the British home fleet is transferred to our coast, Italy's countermeasures will be even more serious. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>Athens: The Italian-owned Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea are engaged in very active naval and military preparations. The Italian government has successively transported troops, military supplies, and aircraft there. Italian destroyers are currently patrolling and surveying the sea off the islands of Patmos, Leros, Kos, and Kalymnos. Heavy coastal guns are being transported from Kalymnos and installed in Leros. The coastlines of the islands are heavily guarded. The authorities announced that if motorboats carrying residents escape into Greek territory, the boat owners will be executed immediately. The Dodecanese Islands were originally owned by Greece. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>

<h3>Speculation on the Content of the Five-Power Committee's Recommendations; Granting Italy Political and Economic Rights; No One Believes Mussolini Can Accept</h3>
<p>(Geneva) It is reported that the Five-Power Special Committee will continue its work until the end of this week, in the hope of completing its report on Monday or Tuesday night next week and submitting it to both Italy and Abyssinia. No one here dares to predict that Mussolini will accept the recommendations of Paris. Mussolini has rejected the broad scope of these recommendations, but the Special Committee's report is said to still be based on the Paris recommendations. All circles in Geneva are delighted that the League of Nations can now escape from the greatest difficulty in its history of establishment, and that all countries will stand on a common front to deal with aggressor nations. Polish representative Beck and Turkish representative Aras, who are both members of the Special Committee, have found it difficult to speak out due to their positions, and have both agreed not to speak at the League of Nations General Assembly. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The Five-Power Committee met twice today to discuss the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. The Special Committee is now clearly working on reformatting all the recommendations of the Paris Three-Power Conference in order to find a basis that is easier for Italy to accept, and may stipulate some concessions on the guarantees to France and Britain, but there is absolutely no question of any concessions that would undermine Abyssinia's sovereignty and political independence. British political circles firmly stated that the issue of trusteeship is out of the question, as the concept of trusteeship is fundamentally contrary to membership in the League of Nations. The Special Committee's report will be submitted to the League of Nations, not to Britain and France. The League of Nations Administrative Council will use it to make a final effort at mediation. The report will then be sent to both Italy and Abyssinia. If Italy rejects it, the Administrative Council will have no choice but to proceed with Article 15 of the League of Nations Covenant. According to Article 15, an investigative committee should be appointed to propose a solution to the dispute. If it is still not accepted by both parties, it will lead to sanctions. (Reuters dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to the Times' correspondent in Geneva, the Five-Power Committee will likely give Italy a new guarantee, so that Italy can have economic and political advantages in Abyssinia. The method is to adopt a trusteeship system, similar to Britain's position in Iraq. However, it is still questionable whether this proposal can be answered by the Italian representative Aloisi before the closing of this session of the League of Nations Administrative Council. The Italian Cabinet is now scheduled to meet on September 14th. Everything will depend on Rome's attitude. The Times' correspondent in Rome also stated that the Italian government is prepared to consider this proposal, but believes that the relationship between Italy and Abyssinia cannot be compared with the current position of Iraq. Regardless of the method, if it must rely on Abyssinia's goodwill to implement it, Italy will reject it. The Italian government also believes that although the Abyssinian emperor can be allowed to maintain his throne, it is necessary for Italy to control Abyssinia politically and militarily. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The British press has been commenting on the suggestion by the League of Nations Administrative Council's Five-Power Committee, that Italy should have economic and political advantages in Abyssinia, placing it in a position similar to Britain's in Iraq. The Labour Party's organ, the Daily Herald, states that Abyssinia should cede land to Italy, and that Britain and France should give Abyssinia a piece of land from their Somali territories as compensation for a sea route. The Times states that Djibouti, a port in French Somaliland, will become a free port for Abyssinia's use. It also states that there is a suggestion to establish a collective trusteeship system, with Italy participating. What is even more surprising is that this system will gradually evolve until Abyssinia becomes an Italian protectorate. The British representative is closely monitoring the development of the situation and is prepared to intervene at any time to draw a clear line between establishing a collective trusteeship and sacrificing Abyssinia's sovereignty. (Havas dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Popolo d'Italia recently published a commentary, stating, "There are only three ways to solve the problem of overpopulation: one is to redistribute the resources currently occupied by various colonial powers in a suitable manner; the second is to occupy colonies that have not yet been occupied; and the third is to wage war against current colonial powers. The first method was mentioned by British Foreign Secretary Hoare in his speech at the League of Nations General Assembly, and we may as well consider it. However, Hoare probably meant that Italy should wait patiently. The second method is the one that Italy is currently adopting, but it has unexpectedly angered Britain. If these two methods do not work, then naturally there is only the third method, which is to wage war against the colonial powers to obtain resources." (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Official circles still express doubt about whether the conciliation process being carried out by the Five-Power Committee in Geneva will be successful, believing that Italy has three aspirations: (1) the security of Italian East Africa colonies; (2) the economic and demographic expansion of Italian territory; and (3) the military protection of this expansion. It is doubtful whether the Committee's proposals are in line with these aspirations of Italy. If a solution is sought according to the Iraqi system, then these aspirations of Italy must first be satisfied before they can be accepted by Italy. Furthermore, the current Iraqi system was established in an environment of complete friendship between Britain and Iraq, which is very different from the current Italian-Abyssinian relationship. Finally, the intention is probably to say that Italy has sufficient reasons to freely carry out its mission in Abyssinia. (Havas dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian government has issued a new order that all registered stocks issued by private companies must be subject to a 10% dividend tax. It is estimated that this new tax can increase the country's revenue by 250 million lire per year. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Foreign newspapers have been widely reporting that Italy will suspend commercial debt payments. Today, an official statement was issued denying these rumors and stating that Italy has decided to pay all ordinary debts in cash. (National News Agency dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>South African Representative Warns That All Black People in Africa May Rise Up in Unison</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The speech given by South African representative Te Water to the League of Nations General Assembly today was also quite noteworthy. He stated that South Africa is part of Africa, so it is particularly concerned about the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, and warned that wars of conquest will one day suffer their most serious consequences, as uprisings will sweep across Africa to resist such evils. This will mean that the barbarism of the past will inevitably reappear today. The people of the Black Continent must be taught independence through peaceful means, and should not be forced by force. This is the principle of League of Nations mandates. Once the war in East Africa breaks out, this system will be completely disintegrated. Will a great man of a great country, who has completed the reorganization of internal affairs, risk the world's condemnation? Based on this hope, I appeal to the new Italy and its authorities, and I believe that there will still be politicians in Europe who deeply understand the urgency of the situation and return Europe to the path of truth.

<h3>Different Reactions to the French Foreign Minister's Speech; The US Side Says It Increases Hope of Averting War</h3>
<p>(Washington) Secretary of State Hull stated today that he has only read a summary of French Prime Minister Laval's speech to the League of Nations General Assembly, but he is very pleased with the speech and the spirit of peace in Geneva. He believes that Laval's speech has harmonized the world's peaceful sentiments and increased the hope of averting war. (National News Agency dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) A certain important person here criticized the French Prime Minister Laval's endorsement of the British attitude in upholding the covenant in his speech to the League of Nations General Assembly, saying that it was a generous and fair statement. Upon examination of these remarks, it seems that British Foreign Secretary Hoare has guaranteed to Laval that Britain will support sanctions to deal with any aggressor in Europe. He believes that Laval is still working to talk with Mussolini to persuade him to change his attitude. Recently, there have been two pieces of news here: one is that the Five-Power Special Committee is planning to propose a plan to grant Italy de facto trusteeship over Abyssinia and guarantee its economic and political advantages; and the other is that Laval is now trying to persuade Britain to agree to grant Mussolini concessions so that Mussolini can end his war against Abyssinia. (Reuters dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(London) This morning, the British newspapers warmly welcomed Laval's remarks at the League of Nations General Assembly yesterday from various perspectives. The Times stated that the remarks of Laval and Hoare have increased the authority of the League of Nations and enhanced the concept of European security. Mussolini should know that cooperation will bring more gains than willful isolation. The Morning Post stated that Laval and Hoare cannot express contradictory opinions, but it is still doubtful whether the environment will allow their opinions to be put into practice. The Daily Telegraph stated that Laval's words are a clear warning, indicating that France is not merely a passive member of the League of Nations. The Daily Herald stated that if Mussolini insists on his current attitude, the whole world will rise up to attack him, which is detrimental to both Italy and Mussolini's politics. The Daily Mail stated that Laval did not directly mention sanctions, and his purpose was probably to avoid sanctions. The Westminster Gazette stated that Laval has bound France, and it would be a shame to the country if he were to go back on his word. Only the Daily Express took a pessimistic tone, saying that Laval's remarks are tantamount to declaring the League of Nations dead. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>President Roosevelt Endorses Hull's Declaration; But the United States Will Not Be Drawn into the Vortex Because of This</h3>
<p>President Roosevelt approved Secretary of State Hull's declaration on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute today, recognizing it as the only expression of the United States on this matter at present. When asked about the implications of Hull's declaration, the President replied that the declaration does not mean that the United States will move towards war, and that if war occurs, it will naturally pass specific laws to deal with it. When asked what kinds of arms are on the embargo list, the President said that he is studying the entire issue. (National News Agency dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(New York) President Roosevelt is deeply concerned about the situation. When meeting with reporters, President Roosevelt answered reporters' questions, saying that if war breaks out overseas, the United States must remain neutral. The recent legislation has created a six-month period of neutrality and prohibits the export of arms to belligerent countries. (Reuters dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The country generally believes that Secretary of State Hull's declaration on the Italian-Abyssinian dispute is an informal invocation of the Kellogg-Briand Pact, with the aim of promoting French action. It is also reported that before French Foreign Minister Laval made his official statement, Hull was greatly shocked by the trend in Geneva, believing it to be the most serious crisis since the end of the European War. Senator McCarragher issued a criticism, saying that the United States is powerless to reconcile the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, and that a policy of intervention will not only be futile, but will also draw us into the vortex. Senator King expressed that the Kellogg-Briand Pact seems to have come to an end, and it is very doubtful whether the signatory countries can muster the courage to convene a meeting. (National News Agency dispatch of the 13th)</p>
<p>(New York) The New York Times criticized French Prime Minister Laval's remarks in Geneva yesterday, saying that it can be seen from this that the member states of the League of Nations will unite to resist Italy's planned war. How will Mussolini respond to this? Mussolini's mouthpiece newspapers all say that even if it leads to war with Britain, Mussolini will not stop his actions against Abyssinia. If so, then Europe may have no choice but to deal with a dictator who is in a state of nervous breakdown and is in danger. The New York Times also said that it was not expected that the representative of France would make such affirmative and stern remarks. At the same time, the New York Herald Tribune stated that Laval's remarks were extremely empty, to a degree rarely seen in diplomacy. (Reuters dispatch of the 14th)</p>
<h3>蘇俄小恊約等國　宣言擁護國聯盟約　李維諾夫謂毋顧此失彼　葡萄牙履行義務不躊躇</h3>
<p>(Geneva) This morning at the League of Nations General Assembly, representatives from Soviet Russia, the Little Entente, and Portugal all declared that their respective governments were willing to fulfill the obligations placed upon them by the League of Nations Covenant. Thus, the League of Nations continued to receive support. Soviet representative Litvinov proclaimed that the Soviet government's sincerity in fulfilling its international obligations was unmatched in the world. Portuguese representative Monteiro declared that the Portuguese government would not hesitate to fulfill its obligations to the League of Nations. Mr. Monteiro also solemnly declared Portugal's loyalty to the League of Nations Covenant. Yugoslav representative Purišić, representing the Little Entente, declared that the countries he represented would adhere to their declared policies and remain loyal to the League of Nations, no matter what happened. The first speaker today was Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov, who said that if mediation efforts fail and the Italian-Abyssinian dispute is brought before the League of Nations Council or the General Assembly, then the Soviet government will resolutely judge its merits and will not be swayed by newspaper attacks or other intimidating measures. The Soviet government's attitude towards this dispute has been determined, namely, in principle, it opposes the colonial system or events used to achieve imperialist goals. The League of Nations Covenant is a tool for peace and has been slightly damaged by previous attempts. We cannot tolerate new attempts that would completely invalidate the League of Nations Covenant. The sincerity of the Soviet government in fulfilling its international obligations is unmatched in the world. If, as we adjourn, we are certain that the representatives of the countries have declared here that they will not allow new attempts to damage the League of Nations Covenant, then this General Assembly will be a milestone in the history of the League of Nations. We do not want to have any more severe tests, like those we have suffered in the past. Mr. Li then generally described the work of the League of Nations, especially focusing on the shortage of the League of Nations' income and the failure of many proposals. He viewed them as easy to implement, but the result was no different from Utopia. He concluded by saying that now there are things similar to Utopia that prove that they are not easy to implement, and we should examine them carefully. At the beginning of his speech, Mr. Li mentioned reading British Foreign Secretary Hoare's remarks in support of collective security. The representative of the Little Entente also praised Mr. Hoare's speech. People here now feel that the circle of powers defending the League of Nations, with the assistance of Soviet Russia, has been completed. (Reuters, 14th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) At today's League of Nations General Assembly, Japanese jurist Nagaoka was elected as a judge of the Permanent Court of International Justice at The Hague. Afterwards, Portuguese representative and Colonial Minister Monteiro delivered a speech, saying that Portugal was prepared to share responsibility to ensure the collective security system.</p>
<p>Next, Soviet Foreign Commissar Litvinov took the stage and delivered a speech, pointing out the Soviet Union's views on the current international political situation, advocating that the various international negotiations that have begun should continue to be carried out, especially the negotiations on the definition of an aggressor. At this point, Litvinov specifically stated to the Italian representative that if the definition of an aggressor is determined, then various difficulties can be avoided, because in this way Italy would not need to officially announce its freedom of action, but could formally apply to the League of Nations to protest Abyssinia's aggressive actions based on the definition of an aggressor. If so, then I dare to assure the Italian representative that the League of Nations can not only enable Italy to be upright, but also express great sympathy to the noble Italian nation. Wouldn't that be even better? Litvinov then requested that the League of Nations re-discuss the issue of disarmament, especially the Soviet Union's proposal for the complete disarmament of all countries, and said, "Europe must now establish a collective organization under the leadership of the League of Nations, but it is a pity that discussing European issues in Geneva may not be what representatives of non-European countries want to hear. In addition to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, there are other issues that are worrying. World peace cannot be divided, and it is not appropriate to focus on one thing and lose sight of the other. As far as the Soviet Union itself is concerned, it has signed mutual assistance treaties with France and Czechoslovakia in the past, and has also devoted itself to the Eastern European Pact. It has made meager efforts for the collective security system. On the contrary, the bilateral treaty system is not enough to show the desire for peace."</p>
<p>Litvinov went on to point out that British Foreign Secretary Hoare also expressed his support for the collective security system. In conclusion, he said that the Soviet Union did not want to favor either Italy or Abyssinia. What the Soviet Union hoped for was that the League of Nations Covenant should make it a tool for peace.</p>
<p>Then, the representative of Czechoslovakia spoke, saying that the Little Entente countries unanimously supported the League of Nations Covenant. Greek Foreign Minister Maximos also delivered a speech, strongly praising the good understanding between the Balkan Pact countries, and expressing Greece's willingness to maintain friendly relations with its neighboring countries. Finally, Latvian representative Muenster spoke, advocating for strengthening the effectiveness of the League of Nations Covenant. At this point, the League of Nations Council announced a recess, to reconvene at 3:30 PM. (Havas, 14th)</p>
<h3>蘇俄對英滿意　霍爾言論足糾正已往錯誤</h3>
<p>(Moscow) The Zhenli Bao [Pravda] says, "British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech at the General Assembly is very important and should not be taken lightly. The most noteworthy point is that Hoare strongly stated that the British government is willing to support the League of Nations and is concerned about collective security. Hoare acknowledges that the collective security system is the most effective way to preserve peace. What the Soviet Union is concerned about is striving for peace. We can only preserve peace by resolutely fighting this extreme threat whenever a war crisis arises. Therefore, Soviet public opinion can only be satisfied with Hoare's speech. With Hoare's courage, he was able to admit that there were indeed some errors in the British government's foreign policy. We must admit that Britain's attitude towards the Manchurian Incident, the recent Anglo-German naval agreement, and Britain's failure to actively assist the Eastern European Mutual Assistance Pact can all make people doubt whether Britain is a suitable supporter of collective security. We hope that Hoare's speech will be backed by the British government's actual actions. These actions are to resist the threat of war, regardless of whether this threat will directly affect the interests of the British Empire." (Tass, 14th)</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫　新黨發表宗旨</h3>
<p>Belgrade The Yugoslav United Radical Party was formed by Prime Minister Stojadinović, uniting the former Serbian Radical Party with the Bosnian Muslim Party and the Slovenian People's Party. The cadres of the new party recently published a letter to party members, requesting that organizational work be started throughout the country. The letter stated that the party's creed is "to unite with the people and serve the people." We firmly believe that the people's political training has matured, and they have sufficient ability to cooperate in all national affairs. The party's platform is based on the following basic principles: national unity, state unity, the monarchy, and the Karađorđević dynasty as the foundation of the country. The letter to party members also calls on all party members to abandon past grievances and work together to ensure that there is only one party in every city and town in the country, namely, our party.

<h3>長岡春一　當選國際法庭法官</h3>
<p>(Geneva) After the death of International Court of Justice Judge Dr. Adachi, the question of which country's representative would succeed him attracted much attention from all over the world. Because Japan withdrew from the League of Nations and there were many strong candidates from various countries, it was not optimistic for a time whether Nagaoka Shun'ichi, the candidate nominated by the Japanese government, would be elected. However, at the League of Nations General Assembly that opened at 11:00 a.m. on the 14th, as a result of the election, Nagaoka Shun'ichi was elected. (Nichi-Ren, 14th)</p>
<h3>美與哥倫比亞　簽定最惠國商約</h3>
<p>(Washington) According to news from the State Department today, the United States and the South American country of Colombia have signed an unconditional most-favored-nation treaty. The contents have not yet been announced, but it is reported that the import of Colombian coffee can continue to be duty-free, and Colombia will also grant considerable preferential treatment to American goods. Thirty days after the Colombian Congress approves it, this treaty will take effect. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<h3>印度提高毛織物關稅　大阪商會恊議應付</h3>
<p>Osaka The Indian government is preparing to raise the tariff on imported wool fabrics to 50% to 60% ad valorem (British goods remain at 25% ad valorem). The Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry is scheduled to convene a committee on the 18th to discuss countermeasures. (Nichi-Ren, 14th)</p>
<p>蘇聯保存古跡</p>
<p>(Tass, Moscow, August 23rd) The Historical Museum and a special government committee are in charge of preserving 12,000 ancient fortresses, churches, monasteries, palaces, sculptures, bridges, etc. Last year, the Historical Museum restored ancient sites in Moscow, Leningrad, and other places, such as the Library built by the famous architect Bov of the early 19th century, the Tsar's Winter Palace built by the famous Italian architect Rastrelli, the beautiful frescoes of the 12th-century Nereditsa Church, and the frescoes of the private residence of the former Moscow millionaire Khludov. The museum also preserves ancient tents, embroideries, etc. For example, a Chinese silk tent obtained during the excavation of a tunnel in Moscow was torn into several pieces. The museum's chemists and restorers used special methods to restore its patterns. Currently, Empress Elizabeth's coronation gown has also been restored. The museum can also transfer frescoes onto canvas. When a certain Church of Christ the Savior was demolished, a portion of the frescoes by the Russian painter Semiradsky was transferred onto cloth. This work was supervised by the artist Bognoslavsky.</p>
<p>This year, the Moscow Museum will undertake several heavy tasks, one of which is to transfer all the frescoes of the Moscow Monastery given by 17th-century artists onto cloth. This work is really due to the famous artist Bognoslavsky, who shocked the world in 1913 when he transferred Repin's famous painting "Ivan the Terrible and His Son." For the past 30 years, Bognoslavsky has participated in all such works. He not only adopted the original theories and experience, but also created several new methods and finally achieved success.</p>
<h3>艾登夫婦均善修飾</h3>
<p>(London) Eden is the best-groomed man in England, and his wife is the most fashionable young woman in England. Her image can be seen in various magazines almost every week, but few people are familiar with her private life. Mrs. Eden is the third daughter of Sir Beckett and married Eden at the age of eighteen. She now has two sons, Simon, ten years old, and Nicholas, four years old. Although Mrs. Eden's footprints are not as wide as her husband's, she has also traveled far and wide. Last year, when Eden traveled to Northern Europe, she went to South America. Although she is Eden's right-hand man, her service to her husband often requires her to go out and work, causing the couple to be separated, which is very unpleasant. The Edens have one thing in common: both of them like to dress up. Mrs. Eden's clothing is especially praised by fashion. The fame they bear in the diplomatic world is also comparable. Their conversations with guests are often eloquent and insightful, but she deeply loves home life. (National Telegram, 13th)</p>
<h3>蘇俄征服北冰洋</h3>
<p>Murmansk The Soviet cargo steamer Anadyr traveled 11,500 miles along the Northern Sea Route for two and a half months. The ship has arrived here. Another ship participating in this voyage, the Stalingrad, will also arrive. Two other ships, the Varenti and the Iskra, sailing in the opposite direction, will also complete the voyage. The voyages of the above four ships have opened a new page in the history of conquering the Arctic region. Izvestia commented on this, saying, "This success is due to the persistent and enthusiastic work of all Soviet Arctic workers, meteorologists, Arctic stations, radio operators, aviators, exploration teams, and icebreakers leading ships through the ice floes of the Arctic Ocean. Only a socialist country has the strength to launch a struggle to conquer the Arctic Ocean, and this strength is absolutely not possessed by capitalist countries." (Tass, 14th)</p>

<p>Southern Travel Impressions</p>
<p>— Special Correspondent Qian Hua</p>
<p>(37) A Visit to Li Zongren</p>
<p>Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief of the Fourth Group Army, is magnanimous and approachable. In his spare time from military affairs, he rides horses and gallops in the suburbs, abstaining from all bad habits. He is extremely frugal at home. The families of Mr. Li and Deputy Commander-in-Chief Bai Chongxi live together in the inner courtyard of the Ministry, in several ordinary houses, not in high-rise buildings, with servants following them. Leaders such as Li and Bai all wear gray cloth military uniforms, with only slight differences in their collar badges from ordinary soldiers. Otherwise, it would be difficult to distinguish the commander-in-chief from the soldiers. Mr. Li often goes out for rides alone, dozens of miles away, or walks the streets in the early morning or evening, with very few guards accompanying him. Therefore, the people of Nanning are familiar with Mr. Li's face. Mr. Li is usually in Guangzhou, responsible for contacting foreign affairs. The internal military reorganization is all entrusted to Bai Chongxi. This time, the six academic groups held a meeting in Nanning. Mr. Li specially returned to Nanning from Guangzhou to personally host them. The conference was held in Nanning for four days. Every night there were banquets from all sides, and Li attended each one in person, repeatedly delivering encouraging speeches, advocating academic and scientific nation-building, which moved the audience. At that time, Bai Chongxi was suffering from hemorrhoids and only came to the provincial government on the last day to give a public speech. This reporter visited Mr. Li at the headquarters of the Fourth Group Army. The headquarters were old-fashioned houses, and the layout and equipment were very simple. As usual, I filled out a visitor registration form at the reception desk. The procedure was extremely simple. The messenger soldiers sat casually in the room, saying that the commander-in-chief was just meeting guests and asked me to wait a moment. So I inquired about Mr. Li's office and meeting situation. They said that the headquarters personnel could meet and ask for instructions at any time, or detail everything. Unless it was a busy time for official business, the secretary would temporarily see the guests on his behalf, otherwise they would all be invited in immediately. After waiting for less than five minutes, I was told to come in. After twists and turns, I reached the meeting room, which had old-fashioned mahogany furnishings. As soon as I sat down, a secretary wearing a gray cloth military uniform came out and said that the commander-in-chief's meeting upstairs had not yet finished, and asked for my forgiveness. After a brief exchange of greetings, Mr. Li arrived, holding a banana leaf fan and panting, repeatedly apologizing. It was the height of summer. Mr. Li was bald and had his collar open, his hair already gray. He often took out his handkerchief to wipe his sweat. We talked freely about various things, ancient and modern, Chinese and foreign. This reporter said that the spirit of hard work in Guangxi was admirable. He immediately said that Guangxi is a barren land with poor people. The total income of the province is only more than 27 million yuan a year. Everything must be done as economically as possible. Everyone must work hard. It is really forced by the situation, not just a pretense. Therefore, there are many construction and development projects, but the economic strength is insufficient. So we tried our best to economize on military and administrative expenses, and use the remaining funds to do as much as possible for popular education, rural construction, and other public undertakings. Guangxi's construction focuses on the most economical and practical work, and actively promotes those that have direct benefits for the lower-level people. Therefore, it is mostly inclined to be rough and crude, with very little investment. I hope that you will criticize and advise us as much as possible. We will strive to improve step by step. The disease of China's extravagant talk about construction lies in being overly superficial. Building a library for hundreds of thousands of yuan and establishing a factory for hundreds of thousands of yuan are certainly extremely magnificent and spectacular. As a result, the factory loses money because the cost is too high and the supply exceeds the demand. The library provides convenience to the smallest number of people at the greatest expense, while the countryside is still bankrupt and the market is still sluggish. Now we intend to correct this malady and think of the interests of the lower classes everywhere. Then we talked about the militia organization in Guangxi. Mr. Li said that the greatest purpose of organizing the militia is to train the people and create a true people's force. On the one hand, our people are scattered and unorganized, accustomed to the concept of family selfishness and self-interest, and regard the public interests of society and the country as insignificant. It is truly like a plate of loose sand. How can we resist foreign insults? Therefore, we implement rigorous group training to make the people accustomed to group life and enhance their concept of public interest, and implement a policy of self-defense, self-government, and self-sufficiency. Since the organization of the militia, bandits have disappeared throughout the province, and the remnants of the Communist Party have also been eliminated one after another. Last year, Xiao Ke, Zhu Mao, and other departments who fled west were also assisted by the militia in various counties in cooperating with the army to defend and suppress them. It is estimated that more than 7,000 people were captured and 10,000 rifles were seized. The Communist Party has never been able to occupy a city or a place in Guangxi Province. The militia's self-defense force has indeed been fully developed, and so on. The meeting was only half over, and it was already close to noon. The meeting room was just opening for dinner. Just as this reporter was about to leave, Mr. Li insisted on continuing the conversation, so we went to the adjacent room together. The room was a conference hall, with a long table, covered with a white cloth, and sofas and square chairs prepared. Mr. Li continued, "Our country's politics is very simple. As long as the leaders are not selfish and the officials are not corrupt, everything is easy to handle. Guangxi adheres to this principle and promotes honest politics. We advocate frugality. Public officials, regardless of rank, all wear gray cloth uniforms and are absolutely prohibited from gambling, whoring, and smoking opium. If discovered, they will be immediately dismissed. The economic burden of officials is reduced, and the driving force for their corruption is lost, so they will not try to seek illegal wealth and risk breaking the law. Legislation is valued by the leaders setting an example. Therefore, the province's finances are completely open. We will never take a penny beyond our due salary. Some people think we are too stupid. Why not take this opportunity to make a few more money for our own future retirement or for our children and grandchildren? His words accurately captured the psychology of ordinary officials, but may I ask, since the Republic of China, what has been the result of the warlords and officials who have made a fortune after they stepped down? Either they themselves are fortunate enough to enjoy the prosperous and luxurious life of a concession resident, or what will be the result for their children and grandchildren? The people and events are all countable, so why must they be the sinners of all ages and the slaves of their children and grandchildren? Extracting the people's fat and grease, desperately making money while in office, is actually equivalent to suicide. Although we are very stupid, we do not want to pursue this disguised suicide policy." Mr. Li repeatedly explained in his Guilin accent, speaking endlessly. What I have recorded now is only one-tenth of Mr. Li's talk, which is enough to see the consistency of his political thoughts and outlook on life. I also heard from a certain gentleman that when the militia was first established, a guest told Mr. Li that you are now training the militia as much as possible, but someone will use it in the future as a tool to overthrow you, which is very dangerous. Mr. Li smiled and said, "If that happens, many militiamen want to overthrow me because the people do not want me to be their leader, then I will inevitably fall without being overthrown." His optimism is such.</p>
<h3>Han Fuqu and Others Agree on a Specific Plan for Blocking the Breach: Report to the Economic Commission on the Content, Dushan Lake Waters Have Already Reached Jixiang</h3>
<p>Jinan Correspondence: The Zhuang breach has now been open for over two months. The floodwaters have inundated large areas, with southern Shandong and northern Jiangsu both submerged. The affected area stretches for four to five hundred *li*, making the urgent closure of the breach a top priority. Kong Xiangrong, acting chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, arrived in Shandong from Kaifeng and immediately consulted with Han Fuqu, Zhang Honglie, and others on the progress of closing the breach and the transport of stone materials for disaster relief. They have already agreed on a concrete plan. Han, Kong, and Zhang jointly telegraphed the National Economic Commission, reporting on everything. This time, the breach closure requires 20,000 cubic meters of stone. For transportation, they plan to borrow railway tracks and sleepers from the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to lay tracks and sidings from Lanfeng to Shubatou, a distance of about forty *li*. After detailed discussions with Ge Guangting, chairman of the Jiaoji Railway Commission, it is necessary to obtain approval from Qian Daoyin before proceeding. A telegram to Kong Xiangxi is to be sent, requesting him to consult with the Ministry of Railways and instruct them to lend the needed materials, or request the Executive Yuan to instruct the ministry to handle it. The original texts of the two telegrams are recorded below:</p>
<p>Telegram One</p>
<p>"Urgent, To Kong, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Commission, via the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: Regarding Chairman Li's suggestion to open the Yucheng Minnian levee to divert water back to the Yellow River, our previous telegram from Yangri expressed the need for careful consideration and immediate remedial measures, as per the Xijia telegram regarding grain opening. The Yang telegram is received. The points raised for consideration and the immediate remedial measures are of utmost importance. We urge you to consult closely with Chairman Han, Director Zhang, and others to discuss them in detail, aiming for a sound and concrete solution to be implemented as soon as possible to mitigate the disaster. We now present the concrete measures and remedial actions that have been discussed and actively planned in recent days: (A) Concrete measures for closing the breach: Based on the three principles decided at the Dongzhuang meeting: (1) Select a location near the Jiangsu embankment to build several diversion dams to scour the newly silted land on the opposite side. (2) Excavate a diversion channel outside the Jiangzhuang Minnian embankment. (3) Starting from the Jiangsu embankment, construct ten dams along the beach and stone revetments to a suitable location, forming the base of the western dam for closing the breach. Separately, at the south station of the east and west small embankments of Lisheng Village, form the base of the eastern dam, proceeding from both sides to close the breach. Currently, the first item is aligned with the Dongzhuang meeting principles, as the newly silted land opposite the Jiangsu embankment has been naturally scoured in recent days. Zhou, the head of the engineering team dispatched by the breach closure committee, and Song Wentian, the chief engineer, have been instructed by telegram to conduct on-site surveys nearby and begin construction accordingly. For the second item, Jiang, the captain of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, has led a surveying team to conduct on-site measurements, which will soon be completed. Chief Zhou of the engineering team and others have been assigned to re-survey and, once reported, bidding will commence for construction. The third item is deemed relevant to the future base of the western dam and serves to reduce the flow of water from the breach, achieving simultaneous benefits. Director Zhang of the breach closure engineering office was telegraphed yesterday to expedite this project and send Chief Zhou of the engineering team and Chief Engineer Song to survey and determine the construction site. It is also planned to transport the remaining 4,000 cubic meters of stone stored in Lanfeng to the construction site within about a week. The stone materials transported daily from Lanfeng by train will be continuously transferred and supplied. With comprehensive consideration in mind, in addition to the ten dams and stone revetment work for the western dam base, remedial works will be added to reduce the water flowing out of the breach and save the disaster areas in western Shandong and northern Jiangsu. (B) Concrete measures for remedial work: First, construct a soil closure dam behind the Jiangsu embankment, surveying the river to determine the alignment for repairing the dam as it progresses, and construct stone revetments along the river side of the ten dams as the work proceeds. Add several small stone dams at the location where the water flows to straighten the river course. Once this work is completed, the outflowing water will naturally decrease, and the disaster area can be protected. In the months leading up to the closure of the breach, the priority will be diverting silt into the river and protecting the breach to facilitate the work. During the breach closure period, which is mostly after the autumn flood, advantage will be taken of the low water level for construction. During this flood season, all efforts must be concentrated on replenishing materials and planning transportation. (C) Preparations for transportation: (1) Transportation routes: Select the use of light rail from Lanfeng to Shubatou and overland transport by carts, and water transport by ships from Dongbatou to Dongzhuang. (2) The light rails from Lanfeng to Dongbatou have been laid. Due to a shortage of materials, an additional eight *li* of rails have been transported from Jinan, with 54 dump cars and 20 flatcars. The remaining six *li* are being transported and are expected to be completed and ready for transporting stone and rice within about a week. To increase transportation efficiency, 26 *li* of rails, 20 dump cars, and 100 flatcars have been borrowed from the 2nd Transport Regiment, and are being transported and deployed in batches. In addition, the plan to borrow railway tracks from the Jiaoji Railway is under discussion and will be reported separately once there is progress. Also, to supplement the stone supply, the Shandong Provincial Government has requisitioned 1,000 carts from 24 counties along the railway, including Licheng, and dispatched teams to Lanfeng to transport stone materials, and hired 200 additional carts in Lanfeng. (3) For water transport from Dongbatou to Dongzhuang, 250 double-oared boats and 100 fixed boats have been hired in this province, and 100 Gongxian square boats have been ordered in Henan and will be assembled at the Shubatou riverbank within days for transportation. In addition, 200 large square boats have been ordered, and the freight rates are being negotiated. A construction material factory has been established in Dongzhuang and is currently distributing straw, willows, and hemp sacks. This is the actual situation of active preparations for engineering and transportation in recent days. However, because the transportation route requires many vehicles, and the Ministry of Railways has instructed the Jinpu, Longhai, Jiaoji, Pinghan, and Beining railway bureaus to allocate the required vehicles, which have not been fully allocated, it is difficult to assemble large quantities of stone materials at the construction site at once. We request your office to consult with the Ministry of Railways and instruct the railway bureaus to allocate the required vehicles as soon as possible to meet the needs of the project. Also, the faster the project progresses and the faster the materials are assembled, the more funds will be required. Once all the surveys are completed, the overall budget can be estimated and submitted for approval. We respectfully submit this telegram for your review. Kong Xiangrong, Deputy Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, and Zhang Honglie, Director of the Shandong Construction Department, respectfully salute.</p>
<p>Telegram Two</p>
<p>"Urgent, To Kong, Standing Committee Member of the National Economic Commission, via the Ministry of Finance in Nanjing: Your Jia telegram is received. Regarding the concrete measures discussed in recent days for carrying out the breach closure project, and the remedial measures to reduce outflowing water and rescue the disaster area, we have reported in detail in separate items in the Zhenyi telegram. We now find that this breach closure requires a large amount of stone, approximately 20,000 cubic meters, which will be quarried from Baimashan and Dayou Lake. Although light rails have been temporarily laid to transport the stone from Lanfeng to Shubatou for constructing the western dam base and the water diversion dams behind the Jiangsu embankment, the major work of closing the breach still faces the urgency of time and difficulty in transportation. As mentioned in the Zhenyi telegram, the plan to borrow railway tracks and sleepers from the Jiaoji Railway Bureau to lay railway tracks for transporting stone to aid the project is indeed necessary to implement immediately. The Lanfeng to Shubatou railway tracks and sidings require approximately forty *li*. We have consulted with Chairman Ge yesterday and learned that the Jiaoji side does indeed have these materials, but it is necessary to obtain the Ministry of Railways' permission to allocate them. In order to expedite transportation, we request you to consult with the Ministry of Railways and instruct them to lend the materials, or request the Executive Yuan to discuss and instruct the ministry to handle the matter. We respectfully request your wise decision and instructions for compliance. Han Fuqu, Chairman of the Shandong Provincial Government, Kong Xiangrong, Deputy Chairman of the Yellow River Water Conservancy Commission, and Zhang Honglie, Director of the Shandong Construction Department, respectfully salute." The waters of Dushan Lake in Yutai County, southern Shandong, overflowed from the west branch, flooding Jixiang County in the west. The number of disaster-stricken counties in Shandong Province has increased again. A large embankment, fifty *li* long, is being built in the eastern part of the area. Most of it has reached two or three *chi* in height, and at each critical section, willows and Chinese pistache trees are being planted to stabilize it. The function of this embankment is not only to protect the various districts of Jixiang, but also to benefit Danxian and Caoxian counties. Therefore, the county is putting all its efforts into completing it. On the 12th, the county magistrate, Zhang Guozhong, telegraphed the provincial government to report on the engineering progress and the water situation.</p>
<h3>First Ordinary Civil Service Examination in Jiangxi Province - The Central Government Sends Huang Xu as Chairman of the Examination Committee</h3>

After the examinations, the papers will be graded, and the number of candidates admitted will be determined based on their performance.</p>
<h3>General Situation of the Decline of Local Industries in Jiangxi Province - Production is Abundant This Year, But Prices Have Plummeted</h3>
<p>Nanchang Correspondence: Jiangxi is surrounded by mountains and is rich in bamboo and timber, with fir being the most abundant timber. It is the main material for building houses in our country. In terms of production areas, it can be divided into three major regions: the Gan River, the Fu River, and the Xiu River basins. Among them, the upper reaches of the Gan River account for three-quarters of the production, because the mountains of Chongyi, Shangyou, Yudu, Xingguo, and Shicheng in southern Jiangxi, and Anfu and Suichuan on the west bank of the Gan River, are all natural forests of fir trees. In the past, during the peak period, annual exports were consistently worth millions of dollars. Since 1927, the timber production areas have been occupied by bandits, and production has almost ceased. Last year, the bandit areas were completely recovered, and this spring and summer, timber transport on the Gan River was very active, which was originally encouraging. However, sales have stagnated, and prices have plummeted. What used to sell for 30 strings of cash now sells for only a little over 10 strings, with no buyers. The reasons are: (1) Recently, there has been a growing preference for European-style buildings, which use more cement and steel. (2) The dumping of imported foreign timber, such as various types of foreign pine, is cheap and labor-saving, and suitable for the structure of various large-scale projects, making it almost indispensable. (3) The final destination of fir timber is Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and the surrounding areas, which have been affected by economic decline and floods, resulting in sluggish sales. (4) Our country's forest products are neither improved nor manufactured and corrected. They have too much curvature, a significant difference in thickness between the base and the top, and are prone to cracking and warping when dry, making them unsuitable for modern fine engineering. As a result, the situation is deteriorating day by day. Mountain families and timber merchants are suffering losses, and even Wucheng Town, which used to be the center for collecting and exporting timber, is now in decline, fading with the timber industry.

<p>Songjiang: Changes in Township Heads in the First District</p>
<p>Among the township heads in the first district of this county, some have reached the age of seventy or are physically weak and ill. Recently, many have requested to resign, including Xu Jun, the head of Huayang Township; Du Lianhua, the head of Yongfeng Township; Wu Weihe, the head of Piyun Township; and Chen Liuzhang, the head of Baiwo Township. After review by the district office, their requests were deemed appropriate and forwarded to the county government for approval, and instructions were given to hold new elections. However, Piyun Township only has two *bao*, so the county magistrate directly appointed Long Shilong, the head of the second *bao* in that township, to take over. In recent days, the district offices of the five districts have convened the *baozhang* of each township to hold separate elections. It is now known that Xu Tianshun was elected as the head of Huayang Township. Because Ju Weichun and Huang Yang received the same number of votes for head of Yongfeng Township, the matter has been submitted to the county for a decision. Chen Xianhu was elected as the head of Baiwo Township. Once the approval is received from the county, the handover will be handled immediately. The second group of township heads will be trained in the provincial capital. The provincial telegram instructs them to report on the 29th and 30th. The township heads receiving training have already prepared their luggage and will go to the provincial capital on time.</p>
<p>Suzhou: Examination of a Murder Case in Lishu Township</p>
<p>Wang Chen, an elderly woman in her fifties who lived alone in Renmiao Village, Lishu Township, Suzhou, supported herself by running a small grocery store. Unexpectedly, she was murdered the other night. No one knew about it at the time. Until the next morning, a neighbor, Lu Xiaodi, saw that the front door was not closed and went inside to check. He saw Wang Chen kneeling in front of the bed, already dead. Her upper body was naked, and her lower body was wearing a single pair of trousers. He also saw that the clothes chest had been rummaged through. Only then did he realize that she had been murdered by bandits for her money. He immediately went outside to report to the *dibaoren*, who reported it to the local court. On the 14th, Prosecutor Luo, accompanied by police officers, went to the township to examine the body. The examination confirmed that she had indeed been murdered. The prosecutor ordered Wang Caibao, a cousin of the deceased, to prepare a coffin and arrange for burial, while also investigating the truth to be used for the case.</p>
<p>Wuxi: Li Liejun Temporarily Recuperating in Wuxi</p>

<p>Changzhou: Suggesting Relief for Debt Lawsuits</p>
<p>Xu Juxi, chairman of the Wujin County Chamber of Commerce, believing that the National Judicial Conference will be held in Beijing on the 19th of this month, drafted a proposal for a solution to commercial debt lawsuits. On the 13th, he telegraphed the Ministry of Justice to put the proposal on the agenda for discussion and telegraphed the Provincial Federation of Commerce to proceed together. The original proposal stated that merchants often unintentionally fail to repay goods. It takes time to sue, and it is expensive. The debtor is delayed in capital turnover, and the creditor suffers the hardships of less business and a precarious life. Treachery is increasingly intense. In the joy of the upcoming National Judicial Conference, in order to promote Xingying, I will not presume to propose that lawsuits for commercial debts unpaid for more than one year, regardless of the amount involved, be temporarily settled in one trial. Debt disputes with clear cases and purely substantive disputes should not be treated as strictly as criminal cases. It is hoped that the High Court will decide on these matters.</p>

A total of 14,420 was approved for loans. The association will notify the applicants to come and sign the promissory notes to receive the funds.

<h3>Flour Industry Loan Negotiated</h3>
<p>This newspaper reports that the Flour Industry Association previously requested the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to negotiate for goods loans. The loan committee approved that member shops of the association may use a three-shop joint guarantee system, with the association's official seal to certify applications for small loans of 100 yuan or less. The loan committee has already received approval from the Ministry of Finance to proceed accordingly. Luo Haitao, the chairman of the Flour Industry Association, personally visited the loan committee yesterday to discuss and handle the procedures for these small loans. It is reported that the procedures have been largely agreed upon as follows: (1) The application forms will be compiled and submitted to the committee by the association, each bearing the seal of the association chairman and standing committee member. (2) The applying shops must first be investigated and verified by the association before applying for the loan. (3) Approximately one hundred and fifty shops intend to apply for the loans. It is proposed that the association collect the entire amount on their behalf and distribute it according to a schedule. (4) The association will be responsible for ensuring that each applicant member repays the loan in monthly installments, depositing the funds in a special account at the National Products Bank for the purpose of repayment when due.</p>
<h3>Flexible Guarantee Implementation</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the person in charge of the Loan Association stated that other associations could follow the above loan measures. The association's request to the Ministry of Finance to change the credit loan guarantee method to a guarantee by a single reputable business has been implemented since the 5th of this month. In recent days, the majority of those applying for loans are using the new method of finding a single business to provide a guarantee, which is considered convenient. The association noted that many loan applicants, after being approved for a loan, are not very clear about the procedures for filling out loan receipts, promissory notes, etc. Therefore, they have designated staff to provide guidance to the loan applicants when they come to receive the funds and sign the documents, to avoid errors.</p>

<p>China Merchants Bureau New Four-River Steamers: Bidding Began Yesterday, Divided into Material Purchase and Shipbuilding. Dispatch to Shanghai and Hong Kong Shipyards for Solicitation. The national China Merchants Bureau borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity last year, with a remaining balance of over 50,000 pounds. It is planned to use this amount to purchase materials for new Yangtze River steamers and has been approved by the Ministry of Transportation. The insufficient funds will be raised separately by the Bureau. The ship design has been revised multiple times and finalized. Yesterday, the Bureau officially distributed the design to shipyards in Hong Kong and Shanghai for bidding. Details are as follows:</p>
<h3>One Yangtze River Steamer</h3>
<p>To construct one Changting Steamer with the remaining balance of the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity funds. The initial design was based on the Taikoo Dockyard's Wusong Steamer. Later, the New Ship Committee proposed that, due to flood and drought conditions on the Yangtze River, the new ship's draft should be adjustable. Therefore, the design was changed again. Finally, it was decided that the new Yangtze River steamer would be 340 feet long, 47 feet wide, and 15 feet 3 inches deep. The height from the upper deck is 9 feet 9 inches, and from the second deck is 7 feet, with a total of four decks. The ship's cargo capacity, with a draft of 14 feet during floods, is 2,800 net tons. With a draft of 13 feet, it can carry 2,450 tons of cargo. With a draft of 11 feet 6 inches, it can carry 2,000 tons of cargo. During drought conditions, with a draft of 10 feet 6 inches, it can carry 1,650 tons of cargo. The hourly speed is 12 nautical miles. The ship has eight first-class cabins, fifty-four second-class seats, seventy-eight third-class seats, and one hundred and sixty fourth-class seats. The steerage has no fixed number of berths.</p>
<h3>Three Upstream Steamers</h3>
<p>The Bureau lacks mid-Yangtze River steamers for routes such as Hankou to Yichang, Guanchang, and Changsha. Therefore, when building new Yangtze River steamers, it was decided to add upstream steamers. Initially, it was planned to build two, but now it has been changed to three, to be deployed on various mid-Yangtze River routes. These upstream steamers will use new-style diesel engines that burn diesel fuel. After several meetings, the New Ship Committee and naval architects finalized the design of the three steamers. Each ship will be 208 feet long, 32 feet wide, and 11 feet deep, with a draft of 7 feet. Each ship will have a cargo capacity of 500 net tons, and the hourly speed will be 10 nautical miles. After these three steamers are completed, their draft will be one foot shallower than the Bureau's Emei Steamer, making them suitable for navigation on the Hankou-Yichang-Changsha route. They will also be very useful for river navigation. No steerage will be provided.</p>
<h3>Issuing Bids</h3>
<p>Bids are being solicited for the construction of one new Yangtze River steamer and three diesel steamers. However, the bidding is divided into two parts: (1) Bidding for the purchase of materials for the four ships; (2) Bidding for the construction of the four ships after the materials arrive in Shanghai. To ensure broad participation, the Bureau has already distributed copies of the ship designs, dimensions, material purchase bid documents, and ship construction bid documents to major shipyards in Shanghai and Hong Kong. The shipyards are requested to submit their bids for purchasing and building the ships in accordance with the specified procedures, stating the prices. The bids will be opened and examined by the Bureau, and contracts for material purchase and construction will be awarded to those with reasonable prices that meet the requirements.</p>

<h3>Chairman's Report</h3>
<p>After the meeting opened, Wu Tiecheng (represented by Li Dachao) was publicly elected as chairman. The report was as follows: This year, the Yellow River and Yangtze River basins in our country have suffered from flooding. In the past, the weather was hot, and the victims had no food, making them susceptible to disease. Now, the weather is becoming colder day by day, and clothing is urgently needed. We are compatriots, how can we bear to sit idly by? This city is an industrial and commercial center with over one million residents. If everyone can speak up for the disaster victims and generously donate, then a substantial amount will certainly be raised, and the disaster victims will greatly benefit. In addition to raising funds in accordance with the regulations stipulated by the central government, the municipal government will also formulate another method to raise funds, which is currently being reviewed by the mayor. If this city can enthusiastically raise funds, then at least two million yuan can be obtained. As for the fundraising methods, Mr. Mu Ouchu will report.</p>
<h3>Mu's Report</h3>
<p>Mu Ouchu then reported that after the establishment of this association, given the severity of this year's floods, we urgently considered raising relief funds. However, because the disaster areas urgently needed relief funds, this association first negotiated with the banks to borrow relief funds to address the immediate needs. Today, we invited all of you to discuss the fundraising methods proposed by this association. The government has now decided on fundraising methods. This matter is not solely the responsibility of the government, nor is it solely the responsibility of this association. It is a matter for the public. Therefore, this association plans to have leaders from all walks of life take responsibility separately, organize themselves, and stipulate fundraising methods, which should yield good results. This group has already distributed more than one thousand letters for fundraising to various sectors, and many have already responded. However, we still hope that everyone will work together to see it through. Then, representatives from all walks of life expressed their opinions, and the meeting adjourned at around 6:30 PM.</p>
<h3>Fundraising Results</h3>
<p>According to Huang Bodu, from August 16 to September 13, this association received a total of 86,134.48 yuan, as well as 1,000 yuan in savings deposit slips and 40 yuan in miscellaneous notes. Wang Yiting donated 1,118.58 yuan on behalf of the Xinwei Association.</p>
<h3>Xu to Northern Jiangsu</h3>
<p>Xu Shiying, the vice president of the association, has been repeatedly invited by Chairman Chen Guofu of Jiangsu to inspect the disaster situation in northern Jiangsu. He originally planned to go earlier, but because the association affairs were complicated, he could not spare the time and postponed it until now. It is now learned that President Xu will accompany Secretary Huang Bodu to Beijing today, and then cross the river to the north to inspect the disaster situation. Li Yuan went to Japan last month to study the Japanese news industry and, in his private capacity, visited the country's political and business circles. After nearly half a month, diplomatic sources in this port report that Li's study mission is about to be completed.

<h3>Prices of Shanghai Banknotes in Sichuan Expected to Rise; Ministry Regulates Exchange Rate of Sichuan Banknotes; Rumors Spread by Beijing Merchants Cause Shanghai Banknote Prices to Fall</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports that after a recent report that the exchange rate of Shanghai banknotes in Sichuan had fallen, a reporter visited a high-ranking official of the Ministry of Finance stationed in Shanghai to inquire about the situation. According to the official, local banks in Sichuan have issued a total of 30 million yuan in banknotes, but only a few tens of thousands of yuan can be exchanged daily. Previously, the lowest exchange rate for Shanghai banknotes in Sichuan was over 1,700 yuan in Sichuan banknotes for 1,000 yuan in foreign currency. Later, the exchange rate rose slightly to 1,350-1,360 yuan for 1,000 yuan in silver dollars. The Ministry of Finance, because the exchange rate was unstable and the people suffered too much loss, regulated the exchange rate of Shanghai banknotes in Sichuan to 1,250 yuan in Sichuan banknotes for 1,000 yuan in silver dollars, averaging 80 cents in silver dollars per yuan in Sichuan banknotes. After this regulation, merchants saw an opportunity for profit and fabricated various rumors, causing the people of Sichuan to doubt Shanghai banknotes. The price of Shanghai banknotes has also fallen as a result. However, this abnormal phenomenon can be thoroughly understood by the people after explanation, and the price of Shanghai banknotes in Sichuan can rise.</p>

Those present, in addition to Mr. H. H. von Ruemker, included the leader of the Consular Corps, U.S. Consul C.K. Moser, British Consul P.D. Butler, French Consul Baudet, Italian Consul Niro, Japanese Consul Ishii, Russian Consul Spilwanek, Swiss Consul-General Lardy, Spanish Consul-General Fure, Danish Consul-General Schiøler, Polish Consul-General Grabowski, Acting Consul of Belgium Lartigue, and Secretary-General Lang of the Consular Corps, and Secretary Yang Lianshan of the Dutch Consulate, totaling more than thirty people. During the banquet, Mr. C.K. Moser delivered a speech on behalf of the Consular Corps to welcome the guests. It is reported that Mr. von Ruemker has been working in Shanghai since 1925 and has always had good relations with various Chinese and foreign parties.</p>
<p>China Textile Manufacturing Co., Ltd., with an authorized capital of 4.5 million yuan, of which 3.9 million yuan is official capital, has borrowed from the Sino-British Boxer Indemnity Fund Management Committee. The matter was specifically brought up for discussion at the regular meeting of the committee held in Beijing on the 14th and at the general meeting held on the 16th. The 600,000 yuan of commercial shares has been confirmed and are being actively solicited. The company's preparatory office is accelerating the investigation work to compile statistics as a reference for manufacturing and marketing products. The report that a meeting was held in Shanghai on the 14th is incorrect.</p>

<h3>Shipping Merchants Re-Petition for Approval to Issue Shipping Industry Bonds; List Reasons and Suggest Methods for Raising Funds</h3>
<p>Shipping merchants, recognizing the infancy of China's shipping industry, and to promote its development, submitted a petition to the government in 1927 through the Shanghai Shipping Association (now the Shipping Industry Association) to issue 10 million yuan in shipping industry bonds to provide financial support. Chairman Chiang of the National Government forwarded the petition to the Executive Yuan, which then forwarded it to the Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs for review and formulation of implementation measures. This was never realized. Shipping merchants repeatedly urged the Ministries of Finance and other departments to issue the bonds, resulting in a stack of documents. Recently, due to the decline of the shipping industry and the increasing difficulty of maintaining operations due to tight finances, the Shipping Industry Association has been forced to re-submit the old proposal, appealing for the prompt approval and issuance of the bonds to provide relief. After reviewing the proposal, the Ministry of Finance rejected it three times due to lack of funding sources. A few days ago, the Shipping Industry Association re-submitted a statement of reasons and suggestions for raising funds, requesting the Ministry of Finance to approve the issuance of the bonds.</p>
<h3>Municipal Rent Reduction Committee Scheduled to Hold General Mobilization for Rent Reduction; Sends Letters to Various Industries Requesting Automatic Rent Reduction; Re-Submits Petition to Party and Government to Clearly Define Rent Reduction Measures; United Association Petitions Municipal Council for Relief</h3>
<p>The Municipal Rent Reduction Committee believes that the rent reduction movement has been delayed for a long time without concrete measures. Disputes between landlords and tenants occur from time to time, which is a major issue related to social stability and people's livelihood. The propaganda department of the committee has drafted a general mobilization plan, scheduling a general mobilization propaganda week from the 21st of this month to the end of the month. Residents throughout the city will post slogans, and branch associations will be organized by district to promote landlord awareness. The details are as follows:</p>
<h3>Hold General Mobilization</h3>
<p>The Rent Reduction Committee has scheduled a citywide general mobilization expansion movement week from the 11th of this month to the end of the month. In addition to the various district branch associations going throughout the city to post various slogans and distribute rent reduction leaflets to promote landlords' prompt rent reduction, representatives from each district branch association will be dispatched to the Municipal Party Headquarters, Municipal Government, and Municipal Council to hold expanded petitions, requesting the prompt definition of rent reduction measures to maintain social stability and alleviate the plight of industry and commerce.</p>
<h3>Send Letters to Various Landlords</h3>
<p>To request landlords to quickly implement automatic rent reduction, the committee has sent letters to various industries, stating: "Respected Sirs, the decline of Shanghai's industry and commerce has reached an extreme point. Empty houses are lined up in various districts, which can be imagined. Tenants and landlords are in the same boat, weathering the storm together. Automatic rent reduction is not uncommon, but those who stick to their old ideas, refuse to reduce rent, and file lawsuits in court, leading to disputes, are unfortunate. The market is sluggish, and it is difficult for tenants to maintain operations, which is a fact. We should understand each other to overcome the current difficulties. Moreover, prices of all goods have fallen, and residents' expenses have been reduced accordingly, but it is impossible to insist that rent be an exception to this reduction. Tenants are forced to express their sincere request for rent reduction. Please follow the measures set by our committee and consider the actual situation to uniformly reduce rent, to maintain mutual goodwill and plan for coexistence and co-prosperity, avoiding the mistake of 'if the lips are gone, the teeth will be cold.' This matter is unavoidable. I hope you will adopt it. The tenants are fortunate, and society is fortunate."</p>
<h3>Re-Submits Petition to Party and Government</h3>
<p>For the sake of requesting the prompt promulgation of rent reduction to relieve the people's difficulties. The economic decline of our country has reached its extreme point today. The rural economy is already bankrupt, and urban commerce is declining daily. Even in Shanghai alone, the business decline is not what it used to be. In addition, the January 28th Incident greatly damaged the city's vitality. The superficial prosperity is actually empty. "In this time of chaos and famine, the ruling and opposition parties are working hard to revive the economy and allow the people to rest. However, while the price index of each item is decreasing, only rent continues to rise, which is a strange phenomenon of abnormal development. The reason for this is that the so-called real estate industry in Shanghai is purely speculative. With a capital of 30-40%, they want to seek ten or a hundred times the profit, reselling and increasing interest, treating the inherently stable real estate as a speculative business, only seeking personal gain, ignoring public welfare. Even a building in the city has a high rent of a thousand taels per month. Therefore, the Shanghai that was once called prosperous is difficult to find (blank). Now, empty (blank) are lined up, and no one asks. As for newly built residences, with a little necessary sanitary equipment, they are also in short supply and raise rents high, not knowing the prosperity of the entire market, only knowing the abnormal development of the real estate industry, which is a strange thing. Now, the city is not prosperous, commerce is declining, and many people are forced to close down due to their inability to afford rent. A shutdown of a commercial business or factory means more unemployed people. Some even resort to desperate measures to make a living, which has a significant impact on social stability. This high rent and its great relationship with society can be imagined. From a general economic perspective, due to the sluggish market and reduced income, fortunately the price index has fallen, and life can still be maintained. For example, the price of one stone of rice in the past can now buy one stone of rice, but since rent is not reduced accordingly, the price of one house often accounts for a family's living expenses. Therefore, rent disputes have been increasing year after year. Because of rent, families are involved in lawsuits and ruined. If we do not seek relief quickly, the future is unimaginable. Therefore, for the sake of the present, we should appraise the value of the rent and not allow it to be raised arbitrarily. On the other hand, the original rent should be reduced appropriately, so as to reduce the burden of tenants and prevent additional issues. Therefore, the rent reduction movement is purely a problem of stabilizing society and relieving people's livelihood. Since its initiation, it has been over a year, and residents throughout the city are looking forward to its realization, simply wanting a reasonable and fair solution. However, the matter concerns the overall situation and has a significant impact. The (blank) (Council) (Government) are the administrative hub of the city, and should not ignore this issue related to the entire social livelihood. Moreover, the rent reduction issues in the capital Chongqing and other places have long been decided by the Central Political Council. Shanghai is the commercial center of the country and should strive for its prosperity and revival. Therefore, we present the following situation, (blank) Please have pity on the decline of Shanghai's commerce, the crisis of social economy, and quickly make a decisive decision to reduce rent and relieve the people's difficulties. Respectfully submitted to the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Special City Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Shanghai Municipal Council (above are from Dagongshe).</p>
<h3>Another Appeal</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Association, in view of the increasingly dangerous situation in the city and the increasingly tense rent reduction situation, with rent disputes increasing daily, and fearing that this will inevitably lead to accidents if it continues, yesterday submitted a document to the Municipal Council, requesting prompt relief measures. The original text is as follows: "In order to resolve the frequent rent disputes and the panic on the market, we earnestly request your Council to promptly take relief measures. In recent years, Shanghai has suffered from social depression, causing the decline of all industries, the collapse of industry and commerce, and the fall of prices. However, rents remain high. The one hundred and several tens of thousands of citizens who live in Shanghai all feel the pain of being unable to bear the burden. It is particularly necessary to seek a reduction in rents from landlords in order to regulate the situation. However, for two years, we have been running around and appealing, but we have not been able to obtain their understanding. Furthermore, the government authorities have not promulgated a rent reduction regulation, so that landlords procrastinate and seek profit, unwilling to automatically reduce rent, while tenants run around in vain, without knowing where to turn. Therefore, we convened rent reduction associations from all districts of the city to organize the Shanghai Municipal Rent Reduction Association. Since its establishment nearly a month ago, the rent reduction situation has become increasingly tense, with disputes reported daily in newspapers, and lawsuits in court every day. Landlords and tenants are deadlocked, and if this continues, it will inevitably lead to accidents. Our association is concerned about this and has no choice but to submit this to your Council, requesting prompt relief measures, so that the rent reduction matter can be resolved as soon as possible. We would be fortunate, and the citizens of the city would be fortunate. Respectfully submitted."</p>
<h3>City Chamber of Commerce Submits to Ministry of Finance: Requesting Clarification on Exemption of Stamp Duty for Petitions</h3>
<p>Following the implementation of the new Stamp Tax Law, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce noted that there were no provisions requiring stamp duty on petitions submitted by the public. However, government offices often lacked clarity on this matter and were refusing to accept unstamped petitions. The Chamber telegraphed the Ministry of Finance, requesting a public clarification. The telegram stated: "Respectfully to the Nanjing Ministry of Finance: On the 13th of this month, the Preparatory Committee of the Stationery and Instrument Industry Association informed us that on the 9th of this month, a document submitted to the Bureau of Social Affairs was returned unstamped with the instruction to affix stamps in accordance with the law. Reluctantly, a one-dime stamp was affixed as per past practice. We have investigated that the old Provisional Stamp Tax Regulations, in category three, stipulated a one-dime stamp for petitions and applications submitted by the public to government offices. Now, this regulation has been repealed by Article 18 of the Implementing Regulations of the new Stamp Tax Law. The Stamp Tax Law itself does not mention any stamp duty for petitions. The old law has been repealed, and the new law is silent, leaving the public in a quandary. We are therefore specifically requesting your esteemed organization to petition the Ministry of Finance for clarification to ensure compliance and public convenience."</p>
<p>The message continued, "Upon reviewing the Stamp Tax Law, we find that there is no provision in the tax rate table regarding stamp duty for petitions submitted by the public to government offices. According to Article 1 of the law, 'All documents specified in this law shall be subject to stamp duty in accordance with this law.' Therefore, anything not specified in the law is naturally exempt from stamp duty. However, since the implementation of the new law, many officials in various government offices have not carefully studied it and are refusing to accept petitions without stamps. We previously telegraphed your ministry, requesting a circular to government offices in and out of the capital to explain this matter in detail, but we have yet to receive a response. Given this new incident, the urgency of issuing a clarifying circular is even more apparent. We hereby re-telegraph your ministry, requesting prompt action for the sake of public convenience. Respectfully, the Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce."</p>
<h3>Chinese Merchant Marine Captains Association: Submitting a Petition to Organize a Maritime Court to the National Judicial Conference</h3>
<p>Recently, Qin Zhengru, owner of the Hezhou steamer of the United Shipping Company, was involved in a collision in the Huangpu River that sank a civilian vessel. After arbitration by the Maritime Bureau's Collision Committee, the fault was determined to lie with the civilian vessel. Dissatisfied with the arbitration, the civilian vessel sued in court, resulting in a prison sentence for the owner of the Hezhou steamer, causing an uproar among the entire crew. The Chinese Merchant Marine Captains Association has now submitted a petition to the National Judicial Conference, requesting the organization of a maritime court and the exclusion of ordinary courts from handling shipping lawsuits. The petition was sent yesterday. The text is recorded below:</p>
<p>"Petition: Requesting Prompt Organization of a Maritime Court to Protect the Legal Rights of Seafarers and Safeguard China's Maritime Rights. The duties of a navigator involve specialized technical skills. Legally, they are bound by international navigation regulations, local navigation customs, and maritime law. Physically, they are affected by wind, tide, climate, waterways, changes, momentum, and the speed and power of machinery and rudders. Therefore, the adjudication of ship collisions requires a deep understanding of maritime experience to determine responsibility. Steering a ship is different from driving on land. If a collision occurs, the capsizing of a vessel inevitably leads to death. If the responsibility is not clearly determined, simply stating that the deceased is the victim and the other party is at fault would forever obscure the truth of navigation and leave matters to chance. Therefore, to ensure clear and definitive responsibility for ship collisions, it is essential to have adjudicators with genuine navigational knowledge. Ship collisions in the open sea are rare, but they are frequent in rivers, especially collisions between sailing junks and steamers. Sailing junks are often unfamiliar with navigation rules and stubbornly cling to superstitious practices, such as believing that crossing the path of a steamer is a good omen. Currently, collision cases are investigated and handled by the Ship Collision Dispute Resolution Committee of the local Maritime Bureau. However, if the arbitration is not accepted, a criminal lawsuit is often filed in court. Judges, unfamiliar with maritime affairs, cannot fully grasp the responsibility for ship collisions. In recent years, courts have often misunderstood the facts in ship collision cases and ignored the causes of negligence, applying criminal provisions such as professional negligence or manslaughter to captains and crew, resulting in unjust punishments. Chinese people will view navigation with fear and be unwilling to pursue careers as commercial ship captains."</p>
<p>The petition continued, "Many foreign seafarers serve on Chinese commercial ships and are also involved in collision cases from time to time, but they have never been subject to criminal penalties. If shipping companies wish to avoid losses and trouble, they will be happy to employ foreigners. This is a small matter regarding the livelihoods of Chinese seafarers, but a major issue concerning national defense and maritime rights. Is this the intention of national legislation? Our association, in order to protect the legal rights of seafarers and safeguard maritime rights, previously petitioned the government to organize a maritime court. The Executive Yuan approved the petition and instructed the Ministries of Justice, Transportation, and Navy to jointly discuss the matter. However, according to regulations, all ship-related penalty cases are handled by the courts. Therefore, the maritime court should be organized independently by the courts. We hereby urgently request your esteemed conference to promptly propose the organization of a maritime court to protect the legal rights of seafarers and safeguard China's maritime rights for the sake of public convenience. Before the establishment of a maritime court, when courts hear ship-related cases, they should invite several captains with more than three years of experience to participate in the consultation, or invite members of the local Maritime Bureau's Ship Collision Dispute Resolution Committee to jointly hear the cases. This would make it easier to determine responsibility for collisions and prevent seafarers from being unjustly punished. Regarding enforcement issues, our association offers several suggestions: (1) Ship collision cases should be handled in accordance with maritime law and not be subject to ordinary criminal penalties. This will ensure that the special law is effective. (2) If a ship collision results in injury or death, and the captain or crew is responsible for more than 50% of the negligence, they should not be subject to any criminal penalty. If they are responsible for more than 50%, they should be fined or transferred to the Ministry of Transportation for demotion or suspension. (3) If a ship collision case has been accepted and handled by the Ministry of Transportation or maritime authorities, and the captain or crew has not been subject to disciplinary action by the Ministry, they should not be subject to criminal penalties. If the captain or crew were indeed negligent, the Ministry of Transportation would impose penalties such as suspension, demotion, or revocation of licenses. If the Ministry has not imposed any penalties, it is clear that there was no negligence. If there was no negligence, the court cannot impose criminal penalties. (4) Before responsibility for a ship collision is determined, the court should not arbitrarily detain the captain or crew. The captain and crew are employed by the shipping company, and the shipping company is responsible for their guarantee. There is no need for the court to detain them. We request that the above points be discussed. If they are adopted, it will not only be the good fortune of our seafarers, but also the good fortune of China's maritime rights."</p>
<h3>Pacific Association Holds Commemoration of the Discovery of the Pacific, Invites Sir Arthur Salter to Speak</h3>
<p>The Pacific Association, organized by people from countries along the Pacific Rim, aims to promote friendship among the peoples of these countries. The President of the Association is Kong Xiangxi, the Vice-President is Sun Ke, the President of the Shanghai Branch is Wang Rutang, and the Vice-Presidents are Guo Bingwen, Marshall from the UK, and Funatsu from Japan. The association commemorated the 422nd anniversary of the discovery of the Pacific by the Spaniard Vasco Núñez de Balboa on the 25th of this month at the Cathay Hotel on Nanjing Road. Mr. Arnold, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Council, was invited as the chairman, and Mr. Lin Yutang of the Academia Sinica gave a speech. Consuls from various countries stationed in Shanghai also delivered congratulatory messages. It is also reported that the association, learning that Sir Arthur Salter, the top economic advisor to the British government, will soon come to China to investigate China's economy and study the currency system in order to restore global economic stability, has sent a letter of invitation through Mr. Guo Bingwen, representing the association, inviting him to speak at the meeting.</p>
<h3>Ministry of Industry Establishes Mining Finance Committee in Shanghai, Cao Liuhegou Mining Company Serves as Office</h3>
<p>To rescue domestic mine owners, the Ministry of Industry organized the Mining Finance Adjustment Committee to provide loans to mine owners and improve construction. Wang Zhengting, former Minister of Foreign Affairs and current Chairman of the Liuhegou Mining Company, was appointed Chairman of the Committee, and Zhao Jinqing and Xin Zhi and others were appointed as members. The first meeting was held in Beijing. A reporter from the Dagong News learned yesterday morning from mining industry sources that the committee has been formally established in Shanghai due to the increasingly precarious situation of mine owners and the urgency of the rescue work. The Cao Liuhegou Coal Mine Company will serve as the temporary office location. The Ministry of Industry originally planned to borrow 10 million yuan to rescue mine owners, which would be managed by the Financial Adjustment Committee. However, in recent years, all mines have experienced a downturn, mainly due to oversupply, overproduction, and competition from foreign goods. Mines urgently need to be improved, such as their transportation equipment, to reduce costs and maintain operations. Improvement of equipment requires funding, so many have requested loans from the Adjustment Committee. Even large-scale companies like Zhongxing need cash. Mining is a large-scale enterprise, and the loans needed are not in the tens of thousands, but more. The total amount of loans requested by various mines has already reached over 10 million yuan, which is insufficient. The Mining Finance Adjustment Committee has decided to hold its second committee meeting within days to discuss and review the loan applications.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Lawyers Association Joint Meeting of Executive and Supervisory Committees, Meeting No. 207</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Lawyers Association convened its 207th joint emergency meeting of the executive and supervisory committees at its office at 572 Rue Amiral Bayle, corner of Route Lafayette, at 7 PM last night. Committee members Shen Junru, Gu Shijie, Wei Weiqing, Shen Ying Shi, Pan Xi, Yang Li, Zhu Fuju, Wu Guochang, Ge Zhitian, Zhu Ya Kui, Yuan Yang An, Xu Zuoliang, Zhang Jian, Shi Liang, Jin Ximin, Shi Lin, Yu Chengxiu, Chen Tingrui, Mao Yun, Zhou Shiying, Sun Zuji, Zhao Yunshang, E Sen, Huang Huijie, Zhang Wensheng, Qian Zhongdao, Feng Xizui, and Fu Ganghou attended. Gu Shijie was elected chairman, and Dai Jixian recorded the minutes. The meeting proceeded as usual. The agenda is recorded below:</p>
<p>(1) Chairman's report: The 7th Representative Congress of the Lawyers Association of the Republic of China was originally scheduled to be convened at the Chinese Arts and Crafts Society on September 23rd. Notices were sent to various associations requesting them to send representatives. Recently, we received a letter from the representatives attending the Judicial Conference to the delegation of representatives attending the Judicial Conference, suggesting that the meeting be held earlier to facilitate their attendance in Shanghai. The committee is asked to review and decide whether to convene the meeting earlier. Because the representatives of various associations were eager to leave Beijing, and after consulting the association's constitution, it was decided that the representative congress should be notified two days in advance. Therefore, the previously decided date of the meeting was revoked, and a new meeting will be convened in accordance with the law. The committee is asked to review the matter. (Resolution) Notify various lawyers associations that the previously set date of September 23rd for the 7th Representative Congress has been revoked.</p>
<p>(2) Member Yang Shaozhi reported that he also serves as the principal of the Municipal Dexin Elementary School and requested permission. (Resolution) The position of principal of a municipal elementary school is a salaried public office. According to the lawyers' regulations and the association's constitution, he cannot hold both positions concurrently. Reply accordingly.</p>
<p>(4) Committee member Zhu Fuju proposed forwarding a letter to the Shanghai Second Special District District Court, requesting that the main text of civil judgments be posted on the day of the judgment and published in the newspaper the following day.</p>
<p>(5) Committee member Yu Yongxiu proposed that, regarding Committee member Zhu Fuju's proposal, a letter should also be sent to the Shanghai District Court and the Jiangsu High Court Branch of the First Special District District Court.</p>
<p>(6) Committee member Sun Zuji proposed that the main text of both civil and criminal judgments should be posted on the day of the judgment and sent to various newspapers for publication. The above three cases are combined. (Resolution) Approved and forwarded to the courts for attention.</p>
<p>(7) Committee member E Sen proposed a suggestion to the Shanghai First Special District District Court to improve the receiving office. (Resolution) Forward the letter to the Second Special District District Court.</p>
<p>(8) Committee members Yu Chengxiu, Sun Zuji, and Chen Tingrui reported on the proceedings of the meeting of the lawyer delegation attending the National Judicial Conference and submitted proposals. (Resolution) Filed for future reference.</p>
<p>(9) Lawyers Xu Tongshao and Pang Bingli applied for membership. (Resolution) Xu Tongshao's application was approved. Pang Bingli's application was not approved because he graduated from the Department of Politics, and according to the regulations of the Lawyer Qualification Committee, he cannot obtain lawyer qualification. There are still doubts. After the meeting, it was already late at night, and the meeting was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Su-Hu Highway: Su-Kun Section Completed and Open to Traffic</h3>
<p>According to the Huadong News Agency, the Su-Kun section of the Su-Hu Highway, which is more than 40 kilometers long, was officially opened to traffic on August 11th to facilitate passengers on the Su-Kun section. Business was good. However, in a few days, the road surface was damaged, and the driving became bumpy and dangerous. The management office then notified all branch stations on August 26th to temporarily suspend ticket sales and stop traffic for road repairs. Road workers were actively repairing the road. The Jiangsu Construction Department sent technician Chen Mao to inspect and accept the work and ordered the original contractor, Zhenhua Construction Company, to be responsible for the repairs. The work has been completed and traffic resumed as usual on the 11th. The fares remain the same, and the schedule has not changed.</p>
<h3>Solicitation of Historical Materials on Ancient Printing Technology</h3>
<p>Mr. Pei Shi, manager of the Zhonghua University Bookstore at 160 Avenue Edward VII, is currently engaged in compiling a special collection on ancient Chinese printing technology. Based on his daily research, he knows that China was the first country to invent printing technology, but there are few records about the history of the creators. For example, the inventor of living body models, Pi Xing (translated), who lived a thousand years before the Common Era, and Feng Dao, the printing pioneer who died in 954 before the Common Era, can only be glimpsed in scattered fragments of text, but they are not described in detail. In addition, the art of woodblock printing was used in China during the Sui Dynasty, according to historical records, but it is impossible to find detailed descriptions in the texts for reference. There is no shortage of erudite scholars in China. If anyone can send reference materials on this subject to Mr. Pei Shi, manager of the bookstore, the bookstore would be very grateful.</p>

Afterward, an academic lecture was held in the university auditorium, with special guests Old Man Jiu Liu Ma Xiangbo, Shi Mide, and Zhao Erqian. The event ended at 7:00 PM. A summary of the events is provided below.</p>
<p>Morning Lecture</p>
<p>In the morning, a Catholic leader lectured on the church's property ownership, stating that it is a lawful act and that the country should provide special protection and not discriminate against it. The draft constitution is based on the Three Principles of the People and the Five-Power Constitution, and should follow the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, allowing people freedom of belief and not adding phrases such as "must not be restricted except in accordance with the law" to create disputes and leave future trouble.</p>
<p>Meeting Place Arrangement</p>
<p>The Catholic Youth Gathering was held in the Aurora University campus in front of St. Peter's Church on Rue LUBIN. A temporary stage was built, with the Catholic symbol hung on the cloth curtain behind the stage. Several flags were also hung on both sides of the stage, creating a strong religious atmosphere. To facilitate the audience, three wireless broadcasting devices were installed to broadcast the speeches.</p>
<p>Students Attending</p>
<p>In addition to Archbishop Xu Zhining and 200 representatives from various regions, more than a dozen primary and secondary schools, including Zhengxiu No. 1, 2, and 3 Primary Schools, Qiude Girls' Middle School, Chongdao School, Xiaoming Girls' Middle School, De School, Xu Zhining Middle School, Rende Girls' Middle School, LeDe Primary School, Qin Zhen Primary School, Jieren Middle School, Chongzhen Primary School, Xiao Primary School, Renai Primary School, and De Primary School, with a total of 3,000 male and female students and Boy Scouts, attended the meeting. The males were on the east side, the females on the west side, the primary school students in the front, and the middle school students in the back. The order was good. National flags and school flags were waving, creating a spectacular scene. The order of events was: (1) Playing music, Archbishop enters the venue; (2) Inspecting Catholic students; (3) Religious representatives' speeches; (4) Singing "Long Live the Pope"; (6) Zhang Bailu's speech on the Pope's Festival; (7) Archbishop's blessing; (8) Playing music, Archbishop exits the venue. Archbishop Cai Ning, the Pope's representative, gave a short speech, representing the Roman Pope in addressing Chinese Catholic youth. Zhang Bailu's speech on the Pope's Festival also promoted church doctrine and honored the Pope's intentions. After the meeting, an academic lecture was held in the Aurora University auditorium.</p>
<p>Academic Lecture</p>
<p>At 5:00 PM, the academic lecture began. The order of events was: (1) Ringing the bell to open the meeting; (2) Reciting scriptures; (3) Chairman's report; (4) Ma Xiangbo's lecture on "Academic Evangelism"; (5) Shi Mide's lecture on "The Mission of Catholic Intellectuals"; (6) Zhao Erqian's lecture on "New Scholastic Philosophy and China"; (7) Chen Yuan's lecture on "Chinese-Oriented Sacred Art"; (8) Yuan Chengbin's report on the activities of the Guangqi Society; (9) Discussion (read by Gu Shouxi); (10) Archbishop's instructions; (11) Reciting scriptures to close the meeting.</p>
<p>Ma Xiangbo's Lecture</p>
<p>First, Mr. Ma Xiangbo gave a lecture on "Academic Evangelism," which lasted about an hour. Mr. Ma said that evangelism focuses on two aspects: language and writing. Using the local language is the most effective way to evangelize. He cited the example of the Apostle Paul evangelizing and being surrounded by people. As a result, he gained the sympathy of those who surrounded him by using the local language. This is the effect of language. Evangelism through writing is also very important. Because the regions of China are complex, writing can be used to communicate. Therefore, evangelists read the Four Books and Five Classics. Chinese is difficult to learn. It is a dream for foreign priests to want to evangelize in Chinese. As for the missionaries who have lived in monasteries for many years, they are also shaped and Europeanized, which is not in line with the Chinese social environment. Therefore, Mr. Ma's final conclusion is that Catholic personnel should work hard, and Chinese people themselves should work hard to evangelize. It is not necessary to rely on foreigners or be passive from foreigners.</p>
<p>Zhao Erqian's Lecture</p>
<p>Zhao Erqian gave a lecture on "Scholastic Philosophy and China," which also had unique insights. He briefly stated that at this moment of life and death, no matter what political approach is adopted, the first thing is to focus on national thought, eliminate the inherent centrifugal force, and cultivate its centripetal force. China needs a national philosophy to solve the current difficulties. Some people think that philosophy is mysterious and illusory and has no practical use, but in fact, philosophy is also a kind of science and is not separated from science. Philosophy and culture are used both inside and out. Culture creates philosophy, and philosophy also affects culture. Pure philosophy should be based on facts and affect life. Such as 2 + 2 = 4, and the existence of God, are all truths that can be explained and proven by philosophy and reason, which are no less than any scientific truth that has been invented, and even more transcendent. Scholastic philosophy, from Aristotle to St. Thomas, developed to its completion in the thirteenth century. Its nature does not focus on metaphysics, but deeply understands human nature, recognizes human understanding, and has intellectual function. Its social doctrines are based on metaphysics and ethics, such as the concept of patriotism and the relationship between individuals and the state, and can utilize the inherent doctrines of Scholastic philosophy to improve our needs, psychology, and behavior and revive the country.</p>

<p>Although the oil river high tide yesterday morning occurred at 0:55, the amount was half a foot lower than predicted. In addition to the low-lying roads and ditches continuing to overflow, the tide did not continue to overflow the banks. The situation is recorded as follows.</p>
<h3>Major Post Office Robbery Case: Eight or Nine More Suspects Apprehended; Rigorous Interrogation and Pursuit of Relevant Perpetrators Underway</h3>
<p>After diligent investigation by the police authorities following the robbery case, the Hongkou Police Department arrested a suspect named Chen Yuqing and handed him over to the First Special District Court for interrogation and detention, as previously reported in this newspaper. Furthermore, Chief Inspector of the Inspectorate General Lu Liankui, along with Detectives Liu Shaokui, Feng Zhiming, Song Bingzhi, Dong Shaobin, and others, received confidential information the night before last. All Chinese and foreign detectives immediately set out to apprehend suspects, and by yesterday morning, eight or nine individuals suspected of involvement in the case had been arrested. As of the time of this publication, rigorous interrogation is underway to apprehend those involved. Whether those arrested are the principal offenders is currently under strict investigation by the authorities, and no announcement will be made. Therefore, it is impossible to ascertain the details. The truth will only be revealed after the investigation is complete.</p>
<p>Yesterday Morning's Tide</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, the tide began to rise after 11:00 PM the night before last, and the rate of rise accelerated around 12:00 AM. The tide reached its peak at 12:55 AM yesterday morning. According to the top measurement, it was ten minutes late and measured twelve feet, eight inches lower than predicted. At that time, in addition to continued backflow of the tide into the sewers in low-lying roads, causing water accumulation on the ground, the riverside embankments were not submerged.</p>
<p>Today Morning's High Tide</p>
<p>The aforementioned high tide completely receded by 10:00 AM. However, the afternoon tide is predicted to reach ten feet, four and a half inches at 1:05 PM. The actual level is difficult to assess because the Whangpoo Conservancy Bureau was not open yesterday afternoon. Water was observed bubbling in the drains in low-lying areas, particularly on the Nanjing Road side of Wing On Company, where the accumulation was deepest. The predicted height of this morning's high tide is twelve feet, with the peak expected at 1:20 AM. This is verified by the unobtrusive prediction of last morning's high tide, and the weather is normal, so it does not seem to warrant much attention.</p>

<h3>Robbery Inside Xinbeimen (New North Gate): Two Robbers Wounded and Captured; Housemaid Alertly Went to the Police Station to Report; Gunfire Exchanged, a Rickshaw Puller Slightly Injured</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, a robbery alarm occurred at No. 27 Wutong Street inside Xinbeimen in the Nanshi district. A group of four robbers, all armed with pistols, arrived. Fortunately, the housemaid employed by the victim's family was alert and secretly went out to report to the police. The director of the Yimiao Police Station, Director Liu, personally led the officers to surround and arrest them. One robber acting as a lookout fired the first shot to resist arrest. The police also drew their guns and returned fire. However, the robber was shot and captured. Shortly after, another robber was intercepted by patrolling police officers in the middle of the road. Gunfire was exchanged between the two sides for a long time. Fortunately, the victim's family suffered no losses. Only a rickshaw puller was hit in the leg by a stray bullet and sustained minor injuries. The detailed account is recorded below:</p>
<p>Four Robbers Arrive</p>
<p>Wang Shizhen, a 38-year-old Suzhou native residing at No. 27 Wutong Street inside Xinbeimen, works as an employee at the Shanghai International Savings Society. Unexpectedly, at 9:30 AM yesterday morning, four robbers, all speaking with a Jiangbei accent, went to Wang's house and knocked on the door. At the time, Wang's rickshaw puller, Huang Asan (24-year-old Yancheng native), opened the door, and the robbers immediately entered. One robber was left at the door as a lookout, while the other robbers broke into the inner room, displayed their pistols, and forbade anyone from making a sound. They then drove Wang's family into the rear room and ordered one of the younger robbers to guard them with a gun.</p>
<p>Gunfire Resists Arrest</p>
<p>Two of the robbers intended to search for valuables. Coincidentally, Wang's housemaid, Shen Li (61-year-old Songjiang native), caught a glimpse of the robbers breaking in from the kitchen. She secretly slipped out through the back door and rushed to report to the Yimiao Police Station for assistance. Director Liu Yunfang, upon hearing the report, immediately led Inspector Qiang Yude, Officer Ren Yuekui, and others to Wang's house. However, they were spotted by the robber acting as a lookout. The robber opened fire to resist arrest, and the police immediately returned fire. In an instant, the sound of gunfire echoed, and bullets whizzed past.</p>
<p>Shot and Captured</p>
<p>At that time, Officer Ren Yuekui's trousers were pierced by a bullet, but fortunately, he was not injured. However, the robber was shot by the police, the bullet entering through his left shoulder blade and exiting from his back. He immediately collapsed to the ground in agony, bleeding profusely. Officer Ren immediately stepped forward to capture him and seized a pistol from the robber's hand, loaded with six bullets. Three robbers remained, all of whom fled upon hearing the sound. Therefore, the victim's family suffered no losses. Subsequently, Director Liu discovered that Wang's hired rickshaw puller, Huang Asan, was highly suspicious in this case and immediately detained him on the spot, along with the captured robber, and took them to the police station for interrogation.</p>
<p>Second Pursuit</p>
<p>Afterward, patrolling officer Sun Fengshan encountered a person wearing a black long coat walking towards him. The person appeared flustered and highly suspicious. He immediately ordered the person to stop. Unexpectedly, the person pulled out a pistol and fired at him. Officer Sun knew that this was a fleeing robber from the case, so he also drew his gun and returned fire. The robber then fled, firing his gun along the way to resist arrest. Officer Sun bravely pursued him, from Wutong Street into Fangbang Road and into Guangqi Road. He chased him to near Bijia Lane before Officer Sun shot him, the bullet entering his right thigh and exiting immediately.</p>
<p>Two Robbers Confess</p>
<p>Although the robber was shot, he still managed to escape. He abandoned his pistol on the ground and fled forward. Officer Sun picked up the abandoned pistol and then chased him into the small vegetable market, where he was able to capture the robber. After bringing him to the police station, it was found that a rickshaw puller, Cai Ermao (34-year-old Tongzhou native), was hit by a stray bullet during the gunfight between the robber and the police officer. The bullet grazed his left leg, causing profuse bleeding. He was also taken to the police station. After Director Liu ordered the two robbers to be brought in for interrogation, one confessed his name as Miao Xiaoliuzi, 19 years old, from Yancheng, and the other confessed his name as Qian Bingbiao, 32 years old, from Yancheng.</p>
<p>Principal Offender on the Run</p>
<p>They also stated that the idea for the robbery at Wang's house was conceived by Yang Hongcai, who currently resides at No. 19, Lane [blank], Ren'an Lane, Luxiangyuan Road in this city. Yang is a local, and our pistols were also supplied by Yang. The rest of their statements were evasive. Since both robbers were injured, they were ordered to be taken to the hospital along with the rickshaw puller Cai Ermao for treatment. After the two robbers recover from their injuries, the case will be further investigated. A secret police mission was sent to No. 19, Ren'an Lane, to arrest him. However, the ringleader Yang Hongcai had already fled upon hearing the news, and only his wife, Yang Wang, was taken to the police station and detained for questioning.</p>
<h3>Dental Association Plans to Open Oral Hygiene Exhibition</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Dental Association, in order to promote public oral hygiene and knowledge, has specifically scheduled an oral hygiene exhibition to be held in early October. All information related to oral hygiene is being collected for exhibition. It is noted that this type of oral hygiene exhibition is rare in the country. Our reporter has exclusively learned the details, as follows:</p>
<p>Preparation Process</p>
<p>The Shanghai Dental Association, recognizing the importance of teeth and mouth in relation to human health and happiness, initiated this association. The association's chairman, Chen Weiqing, along with Huang Rende, Sun Xiamin, and others, are responsible for handling and presiding over all matters. They have specifically hired art expert Lan Baidi to plan the drawings and models, etc. Preparations have been underway for more than two months, costing over a thousand yuan.</p>
<p>Scope of Exhibition</p>
<p>Oral hygiene exhibitions have been held several times in our country, but due to their small scope, they have not achieved significant results. The association is expanding the exhibits this time, including text, drawings, models, and all materials related to oral hygiene. The scope is vast. Since the association decided to hold the oral hygiene exhibition, it has been actively preparing. With the support of various members, the work is progressing rapidly. Currently, dozens of items have been completed, including text, drawings, photos, and models. Among them, the causes and treatments of dental diseases are the most valuable and [blank]. Various models, drawings, etc., are also very eye-catching and can greatly arouse public interest in protecting their teeth.</p>
<p>Reception for Reporters</p>
<p>The association has now decided to hold an oral exhibition once a year in the future. This exhibition will last for seven days and will be open to the public. In order to enrich the content, the association is still continuing to solicit various exhibits. In addition, in order to allow all sectors to understand the truth, the association has specifically scheduled a banquet at the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA the day before the opening to host the press.</p>
<h3>Dr. Qiu Ren'gao Accused of Not Returning Inheritance; Qiu Has Filed Criminal Lawsuit; Witness Testimony</h3>
<p>Dr. Qiu Ren'gao, a physician who operates a clinic on Nanjing Road, near the Parquet Market, was accused. After the death of his sister-in-law last July, he personally wrote a receipt for 50,000 yuan of his brother and sister-in-law's inheritance to his nephew, Xie Xien, for safekeeping and promised to return the money in five installments. Later, he broke his promise. Xie Xien and his siblings hired a lawyer and sued Qiu in the First Special District Court. During the court hearing, Xie Xien stated that after his father's death, the property was managed by his stepmother. Last year, when his stepmother was seriously ill, she left a will stating that all of his father's property was in the defendant's possession. When he requested the property, the defendant asked him to go to the place where his stepmother lived with him. There were many ambiguities, which are difficult to describe completely. However, Qiu Ren'gao claimed that the receipt was taken from him by Xie Xien through violence and coercion. However, his relatives later intervened and Xie Xien tore up the receipt. The statements of both sides were contradictory. The court adjourned the hearing to allow the witnesses who participated in the mediation to be called to testify. The details were reported in the previous newspaper. Yesterday morning, Judge Mo Run resumed the hearing. Only one witness, lawyer Chen Wencan, appeared. The defendant, Qiu Ren'gao, did not appear in person. Qiu's lawyer stated that after this case occurred, Qiu had filed a criminal lawsuit against Xie Xien in the Shanghai District Court, accusing him of forcing Qiu to write the receipt through illegal means. Since Qiu filed a criminal lawsuit, the current lawsuit should be temporarily suspended until the criminal lawsuit is concluded, and then a decision should be made. Judge Mo then asked Chen Wencan about the out-of-court settlement negotiations between the two parties. Chen stated that around July and August last year, Qiu Ren'gao, Xie Xien, and Xie's brother came to his office to discuss settlement. He represented Qiu at the time. He told Xie that Qiu's finances were not ample and that it would be difficult to fulfill his expectations. If it were a thousand or two thousand dollars, Qiu would try his best. This was the general content of the negotiations that day. Although there were other conversations, he regretted that he could not disclose them all, as lawyers have an obligation to keep the secrets of their clients. The court stated that matters not related to the case were not necessary to discuss. Chen then stated that Xie Xien often said, "My family has suffered a great loss in this matter." Judge Mo then asked if he had heard Xie Xien say, "This receipt was obtained with my life." Chen replied that he had not heard it. After the court finished questioning, it adjourned the hearing for further review.</p>

<h3>Street Vendor Dispute Escalates on Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession; Police Enforce Crackdown... Vegetable Vendors Arrested; All Stallholders Petition... Demand to Maintain Status Quo</h3>
<p>The street vendors in the vegetable market on Rue du Père Robert in the French Concession, totaling eight to [blank] households, have been operating for years. On September 7th of this year, the French police suddenly sent officers to expel them and set a deadline for the crackdown. The stallholders, feeling that their livelihoods were cut off, immediately elected representatives to submit a petition to the French General Inspectorate requesting a postponement of the crackdown. Yesterday, the police enforced the crackdown, and the stallholders petitioned Du Yuesheng [blank], and held a large meeting to decide on a solution. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Establishment of Stalls</p>
<p>The vendors have been setting up stalls and operating since 1929 on the eastern end of Rue de Consulat to Boulevard de Montigny for seven years. In 1931, the French police once cracked down and prohibited setting up stalls in the area. Later, the vendors petitioned for the establishment of a market, and various shops jointly requested the police to allow the stalls to be set up in order to facilitate business. On June 24, 1931, they received a letter from Fevrier, the Director of the French General Inspectorate, to the Yongshun Yu shop, etc., temporarily allowing them to stay and set up, and informing them to comply with the new regulations of the French Municipal Council, etc. In February of this year, due to the construction of the road on Rue de Consulat, the police officers notified the stallholders to temporarily move to the western end of Rue du Père Robert. Once the road was completed, they would be moved back to the original location.</p>
<p>Enforcement of Crackdown</p>
<p>On September 7th of this year, the French police suddenly sent officers to notify the stallholders that they were prohibited from setting up stalls on Rue du Père Robert and would be expelled. The stallholders were panicked and elected representatives Sun Chuanfu, Wang Fusheng, Li Fugeng, Zhou Wen [blank], Hua Shuwang, Zuo [blank] He, Yue Yize, Li Shiyao, Chen Yushan, and others to the Lou Jia [blank] Police Station to recount the establishment of the stalls and request to set up stalls on Rue de Consulat. As a result, the police ordered them not to do so and set a deadline of three days to move to the Taipingqiao vegetable market. Otherwise, they would be arrested. The remaining stalls in the Taipingqiao vegetable market were all in [blank] and there was no business. There was also a vegetable market on Rue du Père Robert. Now, it was difficult to accept the crackdown only on Rue de Consulat. Therefore, they unanimously argued on the basis of reason. Yesterday morning around 9:00 AM, the deputy police officer [blank] led many officers to enforce the crackdown. Seeing this, the vendors volunteered to go to the police station. As a result, more than twenty vendors were arrested.</p>
<p>Stallholders' Petition</p>
<p>At around 3:00 PM that afternoon, more than sixty stallholders, men, women, old and young, carried a petition to the residence of Chairman Du of the French Concession Chinese Taxpayers' Association to petition. Since Mr. Du was not there, they went to the Shandong Guild Hall to petition. The secretary of the guild hall, Shao Bingjian, received them and agreed to present the petition to the chairman for review and handling. The stallholders then left.</p>
<p>General Meeting</p>
<p>The stallholders, feeling that their livelihoods were in danger, held a meeting to discuss [blank] methods. They decided on the following: (1) Issue a declaration detailing the establishment of the stalls and pleading for assistance from all sectors. (2) All move back to the original location on Rue de Consulat to set up stalls. (3) Investigate the proximity of the Rue du Père Robert to the Taipingqiao vegetable market and allow the establishment of vegetable stalls. The Rue de Consulat is wide, and the establishment of vegetable stalls does not obstruct traffic. It was decided to submit another petition to the French General Inspectorate, requesting to maintain their livelihoods and avoid starvation. (4) If necessary, all the stallholders, young and old, will walk to the party and government agencies to petition and beg for relief. The meeting adjourned after the discussion.</p>

<h3>The Tenants' Rent Reduction United General Association: The Preparatory Office Held a Reception for the Press Yesterday; Chairman Wang Dun'gen Reported on the Process</h3>
<p>According to Xin Sheng She, the preparatory office of the Shanghai Municipal General Association of Tenants' Rent Reduction held a reception for the press at the New Asia Hotel at 3:00 PM yesterday. Over 30 people attended. Chairman Wang Dun'gen delivered a speech reporting on the preparatory process. Wu Ziyuan then reported on the rent reduction and expressed the hope that the authorities would promptly issue an official order for rent reduction. He also stated that the association was in its initial stages of preparation, and everything was awaiting revitalization. The organizational charter was still being disseminated, and funds were needed. Establishing such a large-scale organization and covering various expenses would require a considerable sum. The members were only participating in the rent reduction movement from the standpoint of tenants, with no backing or subsidies from any party. Therefore, all expenses had to be borne by all the initiators, who voluntarily contributed according to their means. This was the source of the association's funds. The fourth article of the solicitation of initiators' charter had already clearly defined this (initiating organizations contribute five yuan, initiating shops or individuals contribute one yuan). This was the reason for the small collection of voluntary donations from the initiators. It was deeply feared that outsiders would not understand or would become suspicious, so this was solemnly declared for public scrutiny.</p>

<h3>Tianli Gas Factory Begins Operations</h3>
<p>The Tianli Liquefied Gas Products Factory in Chenjia Ferry, which was founded by Wu Yun Chu of Tianchu Ajinomoto Factory and others, covers an area of over 50 mu, with machinery and equipment worth no less than 2 million yuan. It is the first in the country to use the airborne fixed liquefied gas method to manufacture various products containing liquefied gas. The details of the commencement of operations and the shipment of goods have already been reported in previous newspapers. It is now reported that the factory is distributing liquid as gifts to various sectors. However, as there was a strong wind and rain on the night it was scheduled to occur, it was postponed to the following day. Last night, the weather was cool, and the moonlight was particularly bright. Therefore, at 6:50 PM, the special train of the German Baishi from the North Railway Station departed at that time. There were a total of eight carriages, carrying four to five hundred ladies and gentlemen from all walks of life. In the train, each person received a special issue and a large box containing mooncakes, preserved plums, and other items. At 8:00 PM, they arrived at Qingyang Port. The railway bureau had also prepared the road, which was lined with small five-color electric lights. Tourists flocked to the large lawn of the road hotel. Guanshengyuan also had large incense burners and other items to decorate the scene. The moonlight was clear, and the night was cool as water. The female guests sat on the ground. First, Mr. Xi delivered a speech of thanks, and then there were performances by the Chinese Kou Ling team and famous singers, as well as amateur Peking opera performances. At 10:30 PM, the guests and hosts said goodbye and returned on the original train.</p>
<h3>Commemorating the Relocation of Han Qifeng Pharmacy: Presenting the Gynecological Specialty Drug "Han Qifeng"</h3>
<p>The Han Qifeng Pharmacy in this port has been in business for over ten years. The products of this pharmacy have been well-received by society since their improved manufacturing. The scope of its sales has become popular throughout the country. The founder, Han Qifeng, spared no effort, visiting factories in various European countries twice to study. He gained a lot of experience in new manufacturing methods, and the results of the improvements can be said to be perfect. Dr. Han has always been dedicated to serving society and continues to work hard to improve Chinese medicine, striving for perfection. Currently, he is expanding the pharmaceutical factory and actively researching and developing new products to meet social needs and recover rights and interests. The old address was no longer sufficient, so it has now been moved to No. 193 Datongzhong Road, Avenue Edward VII. To commemorate the expansion of the pharmacy and the relocation, a special sacrifice is being made. The gynecological specialty drug "Han Qifeng," priced at five yuan per bottle, is being offered with a buy-one-get-one-free promotion. Each person is limited to one bottle, and it is necessary to present the advertisement from today's newspaper for it to be valid. It is said that since its opening, there have been no gifts or price reductions. This is the first time a gift is being offered, and it will only happen once and will not continue.</p>

<h3>Post Office Facilitates Parcel Collection: Designates Six Branch Offices for Collection</h3>
<p>According to news from the Post Office, parcels sent to Shanghai from other cities were previously collected by the recipients with a form at the Administration on North Sichuan Road. In order to facilitate the public living far from the Administration, starting from the 16th of this month, six branch offices, including Longhua, Gaochangmiao, Zhongshan Road, City Center, Avenue Joffre, and Jing'an Temple, will be designated as places for collecting domestic parcels. The procedure is that for parcels addressed to the areas within the jurisdiction of each branch office, the parcel collection form will first have a small strip attached by the post office, indicating where the parcel should be collected. The form will then be delivered to the recipient, who must sign and stamp the form within five days and take it to the designated branch office to collect the parcel. If the deadline is missed, the parcel must still be collected from the Administration, as the space at each branch office is limited and it is inconvenient to store a large number of parcels.</p>

<h3>Minghua Liquidation Report</h3>

<p>Under the assets section: Fixed mortgage loans of over 510,900 yuan, fixed loans of over 228,200 yuan, overdrafts of over 52,600 yuan, discounted loans of over 28,400 yuan, deposits with local banks of over 99,800 yuan, deposits with out-of-town banks of over 900 yuan, debts owed by the head office and branches of over 2,593,100 yuan, securities of over 305,300 yuan, cooperative collateral of over 16,700 yuan, confiscated collateral of over 700 yuan, collection items of over 19,900 yuan, temporary debts of over 31,900 yuan, remittances transferred of over 17,500 yuan, telegraphic transfers purchased of 10,000 yuan, collection items to be collected of over 220,200 yuan, real estate of over 89,900 yuan, business equipment of 2,000 yuan, cash of over 1,500 yuan, totaling over 4,175,500 yuan.</p>
<p>(Balance Sheet of the Savings Department of Minghua Bank Shanghai as of May 23, 24th year of the Republic of China)</p>
<p>Under the liabilities section: Demand savings deposits of over 57,400 yuan, fixed savings deposits of over 20,500 yuan, savings deposits with principal and interest payments of 8,000 yuan, savings deposits with regular payments of over 7,900 yuan, six-year interest-added savings deposits of over 900 yuan, gift certificate reserves of over 800 yuan, redemption savings of 69 yuan, special current savings deposits of 700 yuan, totaling over 95,900 yuan.</p>
<p>Under the assets section: Fixed mortgage loans of over 33,300 yuan, securities of over 20,300 yuan, debts owed by the commercial department of over 32,300 yuan, totaling over 95,900 yuan. Detailed lists of the above assets and liabilities, including account names and amounts, are available for inspection by the creditors at the meeting today. The main details based on the above accounts are reported below. (1) The liabilities of the Shanghai Branch's commercial department are over 4,270,000 yuan. According to their nature, they can be divided into two categories:</p>
<p>(External Liabilities) 1. Deposits and other items of over 1,737,000 yuan. It is reported that this includes internal liabilities of about 300,000 yuan, so the actual external amount is only over 1,400,000 yuan, which will be investigated further. 2. Borrowings of over 937,000 yuan. 3. Exchange coupons issued of 400,000 yuan. (Internal Liabilities) 1. Debts to the Qingdao Branch of over 1,169,000 yuan. 2. Debts to the savings department of over 32,000 yuan. (2) The two items of borrowings and exchange coupons issued total over 1,320,000 yuan. Most of them are secured by the bank's property and loan collateral. The creditors of the borrowings and exchange coupons have the right to be repaid first from the assets within the scope of the guarantee. The depositors are in the same position as the creditors. (3) The head office and the Tianjin branches owe the branch over 2,600,000 yuan. Although the liabilities side owes the Qingdao branch 1,160,000 yuan, after offsetting, there should still be over 1,430,000 yuan to be recovered. In theory, it should be claimed from the general administration. The general administration's accounts only have over 3,400,000 yuan owed by the former Ministry of Finance. Apart from the Ministry of Finance sorting out this old debt, there is almost no other hope. (4) All the loans on the account are being collected with the greatest effort. However, the money collected should be repaid in order of priority as described in the second item. If the collateral is within the scope of the guarantee, it can only be used to repay the borrowings and exchange coupons first. Only if there is a surplus can it be distributed to the depositors. (5) The savings department's funds of over 32,000 yuan have been owed by the commercial department, and it is uncertain whether the fixed mortgage loans of over 30,000 yuan can be easily recovered. The securities of over 30,000 yuan on the account are stored in the special custody vault of the Central Bank as a guarantee for the repayment of savings deposits. In addition to reporting to the Ministry of Finance, this report is hereby issued. September 14, 24th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>Tianli Liquefied Gas Factory has manufactured and stored considerable quantities of ammonia, ammonia water, household ammonia, ammonium sulfate (commonly known as "salammoniac," essential for the telecommunications industry), and other products. Although the quantities purchased are large, the supply can still be ensured. Therefore, it officially started operations on September 1. In addition, the factory's distribution office at 176 Caishi Road (telephone numbers 80090 and 80099) also has stock, so delivery is exceptionally fast.</p>

<p>[Letter</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam, I have read a news report in your newspaper on September 12 about a school student falling to his death from a swing. This does not correspond with the facts. Please correct it as follows: It has been found out that Zhang Guangqian, a student of Grade 2, had snuck along with his classmate Shen Shuwei at around 0:30 in the afternoon on the 8th of this month and went to the swing that was set for Hui Zhong Women's School, used only by the students of the Affiliated Elementary School. This is something that has been banned by our school. Moreover, the two students stood on one panel, swinging with their full strength. Because the weight was too high, the wooden pillars of the swing broke. Zhang and Shen fell to the ground instantly. Shen's injury was light, and he was sent to the Bethel Hospital and has been discharged on the 10th of September. However, Zhang was severely injured. The school immediately sent a Western doctor to give help, but it was still no use. We have reported the case to the Foreign Settlement Police Station and also reported to the Department of Education for investigation. It was also reported that the American Representative of Anxi Baptist Church stationed in China and the Principal of our school, Huang Feijun, applied for a case. We are afraid that the reports were not accurate, and that people would be confused by what they heard. Therefore, we would like to present the facts and request a correction. Sincerely, Hui Zhong Middle School, a private school.</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam, on September 10th, there was a report in the news of this port "A Dispute Happened at Ha Dong Foreign Company due to Rent Collection". This is completely fabricated by the tenants in order to get out of paying rent. Therefore, we must request that you correct it as follows: Anyi Silk Company had recently signed a rental contract. The rent was quite high. However, not six months of the lease had passed, and rent had already been owed for the past month. On the 11th of this month, which was the Mid-Autumn Festival, our company went to collect the rent. The Silk Company refused to pay the rent and even locked the iron gate, locking our collector inside. The collector was released after the police was informed. It was against the law. However, they have fabricated facts and have carried out a public campaign, causing the reports to contain the direct opposite of the truth. Therefore, we must request a correction. Sincerely, Hatong Foreign Company. 14th of September, 24th year.</p>
<p>Dear Sir/Madam, our pawnshop was falsely accused of usury. The case has been rejected by the court. However, in the report of your newspaper on August 17th, in the testimony of the court, "Even the Hinterland takes three percent per day". In fact, the three percent that was being referred to at that time was regarding the Hinterland pawnshops taking one fen and eight li per month, plus a pawnshop rent. Those things that were rough and not worth one yuan were not accepted by larger pawnshops. Also, there was an added a shop rent of 1 fen apart from the other fees. The total charge per month amounted to 3 percent in total. I am afraid that the rumors are not true, and that misunderstandings may be created. We have made this request in order to provide a clearer picture and to clarify the truth. Sincerely, Master of Thai pawnshop. 14th of September.</p>

<h3>Everyone Should Strive to Fulfill Their Own Task</h3>
<p>— Mu Liang</p>
<p>The construction of a new society relies on the efforts of every member of society, each striving to fulfill their own task. This is only achievable under conditions of division of labor and cooperation. However, what is most painful about any construction in China today is that, on the one hand, no one is doing anything, and on the other hand, those who are doing something are not willing to do their duty. As a result, the emergence of a new society in China will never be successful.</p>
<p>Let us first use a biological perspective to prove the necessity of striving to fulfill one's task: We must know that every organism is composed of many cells (with the exception of single-celled animals), and each cell of this organism has a specific task that it performs constantly. Only in this way can the organism thrive and grow. Society is composed of individuals, and it is an organic body. It needs each individual to fulfill a part of the responsibility in order to progress. Therefore, in order to create a new society, we must strive to fulfill our own tasks.</p>
<p>Dear children! You are the future vital force of society, and a new society is eagerly waiting for you to build it. However, in the process of construction, please do not forget to strive to fulfill your own tasks. You should perform your tasks according to the rules of biology, so that you will not be disappointed.</p>
<h3>Yang Jisheng's Childhood</h3>
<p>— Chen Gu</p>
<p>Mr. Yang Jisheng (Jiaoshan) was a great and loyal minister of the Ming Dynasty. When he was young, his family was very poor, and his father had to have him work as a cowherd for others.</p>
<p>One day, he walked past a private school and heard the sound of reading aloud inside. He felt very envious and wanted to study as well. When he returned home, he told his father about it, but his father couldn't afford it and couldn't agree to it. He was very angry and thought: Why can others study because they have money, but I can't because I don't have money?</p>
<p>He usually loved to paint lotus flowers, and therefore, he painted them extremely well, but only on the ground. Once, his uncle told him, "Why don't you buy some paper and colors, paint them, take them to the city to sell, and you can earn some money to study?" So he did as his uncle said, and indeed earned quite a bit of money. He bought many books and read them on the back of the ox every day while working. When he came across something he didn't understand, he would ask the teacher in the private school. That teacher was also very happy to teach such a child!</p>
<p>From then on, in his spare time from work, he painted lotus flowers to sell, and with the money he earned, he immediately bought books. Because he studied so hard, he later became a minister whose name would be remembered for all time.</p>
<h3>Teeth Must Be Clean</h3>
<p>— Pei Yu</p>
<p>Little friends, if you want to properly clean your teeth and mouth, it is best to prepare a little more sterilized cotton wool and a thin orange wood stick, and a mouthwash in addition to a toothbrush and dental gel.</p>
<p>Toothbrushes sold on the market are too large in shape. Brushing can excessively vibrate the gums, and they push the sides of the mouth outward into an undesirable shape. Many people use hard-bristled toothbrushes, mostly thinking they are durable and make teeth clean easily, but this understanding is actually wrong.</p>
<p>The best and most suitable toothbrush is a small one, with soft bristles on the outside and hard bristles on the inside. If this kind of toothbrush is used correctly, the soft bristles brushing on the gums is better than massage, while the hard bristles clean the teeth very thoroughly.</p>
<p>Hold the toothbrush in your right hand, put it in your mouth, and start brushing from the left, preferably in a circular motion from left to right. The inside of the teeth needs to be scrubbed with up-and-down, saw-like motions. Crooked teeth, protruding, indented, or misaligned teeth are difficult to brush with a toothbrush, so you should use a thin orange wood stick. Wrap some sterilized cotton wool around one end of the stick and slowly wipe around the inside and outside of the crooked teeth.</p>
<p>Using a solution of salt and water to wash the mouth is the most economical method. Salt and water are both things that clean teeth and increase their strength. Rinsing with salt water can make the gums firm and healthy.</p>
<p>Finally, we must remember that cleaning teeth is not limited to the one time when washing our face after getting up. It is best to brush and rinse after every meal.</p>
<h3>Rain</h3>
<p>— Lang</p>
<p>A group of little clouds,</p>
<p>Playing in the sky,</p>
<p>Some wearing blue clothes,</p>
<p>Some wearing white clothes.</p>
<p>Suddenly, a gust of wind came,</p>
<p>Carrying irresistible cold air.</p>
<p>Cold! Cold!</p>
<p>So, many little clouds turned into tears and fell to the earth.</p>
<h3>"Guo Guo Ding"</h3>
<p>— Bai Ding</p>
<p>"Guo Guo Ding, wearing a red tassel. Riding a red horse, going to Nanjing." This is a children's rhyme that children in Haizhou often happily shout. Guo Guo Ding is a kind of wild dandelion flower. In fact, it doesn't have any red tassels, but the stem is slightly reddish near the flower, and the shape is like a sawtooth. The bright yellow flowers and leaves are tightly hidden in the soil.</p>
<p>Once spring arrives, on the desolate graves, under the high walls, and on the secluded garden edges, dandelions bloom excitedly and luxuriantly. In the sunlight, it is a fresh and tender light yellow flower, with the spring sun shining on it. The children are all so happy that they laugh and jump vivaciously.</p>
<p>Some little girls pick them, insert them by their temples, and stroll proudly on the street, appearing even more beautiful and innocent.</p>
<p>Guo Guo Ding also has a benefit. It was in the autumn of last year. I suddenly suffered from a carbuncle in my hometown, so my mother and sister found five or six Guo Guo Dings in the suburbs, mashed them into a pulp, and applied it. In a few days, it was cured. This made me very surprised, that in late autumn, I could still see those lovely little flowers!</p>
<p>Little friends, don't forget that song: "Guo Guo Ding, wearing a red tassel. Riding a red horse, going to Nanjing!"</p>
<h3>Cement</h3>
<p>— Rong</p>
<p>During his summer vacation, Xiao Ming had nothing to do, so he often read books, especially liking to read about how everyday items are made, such as soap, matches, and candles. He had seen them all. Today, he found a book on how to make cement in the bookshelf. Unfortunately, it was written in classical Chinese, which he couldn't understand. He could only understand the general idea, so he asked his older sister: "Sister, what is cement used for?" His sister said, "Cement can be used to build bridges, pave roads, build beams, columns, and walls, etc." He asked again, "Sister, how are beams and columns made?" His sister replied, "Little brother, to make beams and columns, you first need to use wooden boards to build various shapes, round, square, hexagonal, etc., pour in the mixed gravel and cement, and after it solidifies, remove the outer wooden boards, and that's it." He asked again, "How do you make a bridge strong?" His sister said, "Building bridges and beams and columns, if only pure cement is used, it is very easy to break. If steel bars are added in the middle, it will be strong. In the past, bridges made of stone and beams made of wood, as well as very tall houses and very long bridges, were not easy to build. In recent years, with the use of cement and steel, even extremely long bridges and very tall houses can be built. The world-famous Forth Bridge in Scotland and the Chrysler Building in New York, a large city in the United States, which is sixty-eight stories high, are both made of cement and steel." He asked again, "Sister, how is cement made?" His sister said, "Little brother, the method of making cement is to grind limestone into a fine powder, then add clay and water to mix it, put it in a kiln and burn it, take it out after it cools, and then grind it into a fine powder, which becomes grayish-white powder, that is, cement." The younger brother asked again, "Sister, even though we have powdered cement, how do we use it?" His sister answered him: "Little brother, just mix cement with sand and gravel with water and you can use it."</p>
<h3>A Diary Entry on the Mid-Autumn Festival</h3>
<p>— Jin Xi</p>
<p>Today is the Mid-Autumn Festival according to the lunar calendar. It is said that tonight the moon will be especially bright and clear. According to the customs of my hometown, whether rich or poor, people buy some wine, dishes, mooncakes, taro, edamame, and some raw vegetables today, or slaughter a duck for the holiday. At night, everyone sits in the courtyard, eats mooncakes, and looks at the moon, which is considered a symbol of family reunion in both heaven and earth. Some families also beat gongs and drums, and set off firecrackers at night to welcome the bright moon, not going to bed until the moon has passed its zenith.</p>
<p>A few days ago, I saw news in the newspaper about floods causing disasters in various places, and I also saw urgent telegrams from various charitable organizations and institutions begging for disaster relief. I was very moved, but I am a child and don't have much money to spare for disaster relief. It so happened that today is the Mid-Autumn Festival, and after breakfast, I boldly said to my father: "Father! Now, people in disaster areas outside are crying out for lack of clothing and food, and I feel very sad. The Shenbao newspaper published an advertisement saying, 'Donate one more penny, save one more life.' Why don't we save the expenses of celebrating the Mid-Autumn Festival today to save the lives of the disaster victims?" My father was very pleased to hear my words, took out the ten dollars he had prepared for the holiday, and asked me to write a letter, buy a postal money order at the post office, and send it to the disaster relief collection office of the Shenbao newspaper in Shanghai. Today, I only ate two mooncakes. My mother said: "These mooncakes were sent by Uncle Wang next door." I didn't care about anything. After eating the mooncakes, I sat in the corner, secretly planning in my heart: "This disaster relief letter will probably arrive in Shanghai in three days. I hope the Shenbao newspaper will quickly gather a large sum of money and send it to the disaster victims!" (Recorded by Zhao Ming'er)</p>
<h3>An Appreciation of an Art</h3>
<p>— Yi An</p>
<h3>Good Intentions</h3>
<p>— Qing Chun Cai</p>
<p>It is not enough to have good intentions; you must also act properly. If you want to act properly, you must know how to act.</p>
<p>There was a little bear whose mother fell from a cliff and broke her neck. His father had long since disappeared.</p>
<p>An old hermit met this little bear, lonely, hungry, and crying in despair. He felt sorry for the unfortunate little animal, so he brought it back to his warm, clean, and comfortable home. He fed it and caressed it. It gradually grew up. It loved him more than it loved sweets, it loved him more than anything else in the world.</p>
<p>A year or two later, the bear grew into a very handsome animal, almost as big as the hermit, with very beautiful fur.</p>
<p>One day in summer, the weather was very nice, and the hermit was sitting in a chair, asleep. The old man always had to take a nap after dinner. The hermit was an old man after all.</p>
<p>A wasp flew in through the window. It was a big wasp, buzzing loudly, flying around the room, and eventually noticed the hermit's bald head and red nose. Indeed, it was a very, very red nose.</p>
<p>The bear sat beside his master, watching him affectionately. It was always like this when his master was asleep.</p>
<p>It saw the wasp at once and was very anxious. It knew that wasps could sting.</p>
<p>The bear thought, "If this nasty wasp stings my beloved good master on the nose, that would be terrible!"</p>
<p>The wasp flew closer and closer! Closer and closer!</p>
<p>The bear was definitely going to make a mess! Just as the wasp landed on the tip of the hermit's nose, the bear suddenly slapped it away with all its might!</p>
<p>Its intentions were good! But how could it explain itself? All the hermit knew was that his nose was almost flattened, and his face was badly injured. The young bear didn't realize how strong it was.</p>
<p>Indeed, the bear's intentions were good! But the hermit thought it had "gone mad." He said, "This thing has grown too big and can't stay here anymore." He said this and drove the bear away with a wooden stick.</p>
<p>Indeed, the bear's intentions were good! But remember the story of this bear!</p>
<h3>Mom Has Become a Little Sister</h3>
<p>— Shi Fenfen, a third grader from Jingzhi Primary School in Wuxi</p>
<p>Our newly hired maid calls my older sister "Miss Elder," me "Miss," but calls my mother "Third Miss." What is the reason for this? Because my mother is the third daughter of my maternal grandmother, everyone calls her Third Miss. And our current maid is from my maternal grandmother's place and has always called my mother Third Miss. Now, she still uses the same title, and in her mouth, isn't my mother now my little sister?</p>
<h3>The Story of the White Mountain Crow (Part 1)</h3>
<p>— Xi</p>
<p>(I)</p>
<p>In this world, what an honorable and painful thing it is to be a special mountain crow! Mr. Chu Bufeng wrote about me, and I am not an exaggerated bird, but, alas! I am very rare, and it is very difficult to find me.</p>
<p>My father and mother were two good crows, living in a secluded Good Flower Garden in the Mailai area for many years. They were a model family. My mother would usually have three breeding seasons each year, and she would curl up in the dense bushes, dozing on her eggs. My father, though old, was still very handsome. To show his enthusiasm, he would secretly linger around her all day long. When he found delicious worms, he would carefully tie them to the tip of his tail and bring them to her to eat. In the evening, if the weather was fine, he would always sing a song for her, which made the people in the surrounding area very happy. These two sweet couples never quarreled once; never was there a single dark cloud over them.</p>
<p>When I first came into this world, my father suddenly lost his temper, which was the first time in his life. At that time, I was still a gray and wrinkled chick, and he couldn't really see my size and color clearly. He would sometimes look at me suspiciously and say, "This is a filthy child, as if he wants to burrow into mud and ash heaps as soon as he sees them, so he is always ugly and unpleasant to look at." My mother, curled up in an old bowl used as a nest, replied, "Hey! My dear friend, how beautiful do you expect him to be at his age? Weren't you a very filthy little thing yourself when you were young? Just be patient and wait for our child to grow up, and you will see how beautiful he is; he is really the best one I have ever given birth to."</p>
<p>Although my mother was partial to me, she also noticed that my damned feathers were gradually growing, which was really extremely... But like most mothers, she would often be partial to her children, thinking that it was her own fault and protecting her children from evil attacks.</p>
<p>While my feathers were growing, my father was very kind to me. He saw me shivering in a corner and even gave me some paste to eat. But when those poor wings of mine grew a new coat of feathers, and he saw that they were all white, he flew into a rage as if thunder had struck, and I was afraid he would pluck out my feathers. Alas! I didn't have a mirror; not knowing the reason for his anger, I asked myself, "Why is it that having such good feathers makes him so angry with me?"</p>
<p>One day, a beam of bright sunlight shone on my newly grown feathers, making me happy. I flapped my wings in a flower path and began to sing. My father heard the first sound of my song and jumped straight into the air like a ball of fire.</p>
<p>"What sound am I hearing?" he shouted, "Is this really the cry of a mountain crow? Do I cry like this? Can this be considered a cry?"</p>
<p>Then he jumped to my mother's side, making a terrible face, and said, "Damn it! Who is lying in your nest?" My mother was very upset when she heard this, and she immediately jumped out of her bowl. She wanted to speak, but she was choked with tears. She fell to the ground, half-fainted. Seeing that she was about to die, I was so scared that I trembled and threw myself at my father's knees.</p>
<p>"Ah! My father!" I said to him, "Even though I cried wrong, even though I grew the wrong feathers, please don't punish my mother! If Heaven didn't give me the same voice as you, is that my mother's fault? I don't have the same yellow beak as you, and I don't have the same French-style black clothes as you, is that also her fault? If Heaven intends to turn someone into a monster and wants others to suffer for me, then let me suffer alone!"</p>
<p>My father said, "That's not the issue. Why did you cry out that kind of sound? Who told you to cry like that, violating all the established rules of our customs?"</p>
<p>I said softly, "Alas! Father, I just cried naturally because the weather was good, which made me feel very happy, maybe it was because I ate too many flies."</p>

<h3>Football Final: District Two Wins Championship, District Two Wins Final Against District Three 4-2</h3>
<p>In this year's Provincial Games football championship, a total of five teams from various districts participated. Teams from Districts One, Four, and Five were eliminated in the preliminary and semi-final rounds. The District Three and Two football teams, who qualified for the final, held a championship match at 9:00 AM yesterday. The referee was He Chunhui, a famous former goalkeeper. After 90 minutes of intense play, District Two won the championship with a score of 4-2.</p>
<p>Analyzing the Game on Paper</p>
<p>In yesterday's match, District Two won with speed. The coordination of the five forwards was excellent. The ball was often passed in from both wings. Left-winger Zhu Baoguang was very active. Center forward Shao Jihua and right-winger Xie Quanggui had sharp and quick kicks. Midfielder Liang Guansong was experienced, with organized attacks and retreats. The two defenders also cooperated well. District Three was based on the Soochow University team, with the addition of other excellent players. The defensive line was extremely strong, saving countless dangerous shots. Unfortunately, the midfield line was too weak, resulting in the area being frequently ravaged. Goalkeeper Zhu Mengsheng was skillful and could defuse dangerous situations in extremely tense moments. Although four goals were conceded, it was not his fault. The forwards and midfielders lacked coordination, giving a feeling of ammunition shortage.</p>
<p>Seizing the Initiative</p>
<p>At the kickoff, District Three, with the sun at their backs and the wind in their favor, seized the advantage. A-Feng dribbled deep, encountering an ambush. Liang Guansong intercepted the ball and passed it to the center. Right-winger Chen secretly passed, and District Two committed a foul. A free kick was awarded, 40 yards from the goal. Cai Shengmiao took a long shot. The ball, with the help of the wind, flew like an arrow from a bow. The District One goalkeeper blocked it, but not far enough. Chen and Feng, two forwards, advanced together, and the ball went into the net. District Two was caught by surprise. With a shot of morphine, everyone was excited. District Three could not stop them. With the two defenders overwhelmed, Cai Zhongjian violated the regulations. He Chunhui enforced the law strictly. Center forward Shao kicked the penalty kick, resulting in a one-on-one tie. With each side having scored one goal, the match became extremely tense. District One's left winger Zhu started an attack from the west. Yin Zhengda kept people away. Right-winger Xie knocked at the gate. Defender Lu passed the ball not far enough. Center forward Shao tried his kick again, making it 2-1, and District Two turned defeat into victory.</p>
<p>Coming from Behind</p>
<p>After switching sides, District Two kicked off, and the five forwards advanced in unison. Zhu Baoguang shot fiercely at the goal. The Suzhou team lost another city. District One came from behind to lead 3-1. Bad luck struck District Three. The midfielders frequently lost opportunities. Goalkeeper Zhu was doing brisk business, saving many dangerous shots. Left-winger Shen secretly fired a cold arrow. The goalkeeper blocked it, and the ball neatly landed in the upper left corner. Team captain Yin Zhengda of District Three shouted, and the exhausted players rallied. Yang Zuxi did not disgrace his mission, raced quickly, and passed the ball from the baseline. Hu Guang ruthlessly kicked the ball, bringing one back. Seeing that the time had come to defend, District Two defended. District Three was determined to recover lost ground, but time was not on their side. District Two won the championship with a score of 4-2. The referee was Si Chunhui, and the linesmen were Zhang Wenyuan and Xu Saizhang.</p>

<p>Local Women's Tennis Preliminary Round: Wei Sisters Win Both Matches; Peiyu Takes Sick Leave, Not Considered Abandonment; Mao Yuwen Wins Against He Zuohui in Singles</p>
<p>The preliminary round for women's tennis in this city's National Games took place at the China Tennis Club starting at 1:00 PM yesterday. Originally, there were four groups. However, Ms. Pei Yu, due to illness and following doctor's orders, could not attend the match against Yan Jingjiang, which was stopped. However, Liang did not abandon the match, so she will not be disqualified. In the remaining group, Wei Maigu won against Su Jianhua, Wei Zutong won against Huang Zhifang, and Mao Yuwen won against He Zuohui. To observe their skills, the selection committee member Zhang Zi and Wang Keyong from the Municipal Education Bureau decided on the spot yesterday that two groups will compete this afternoon: Su Jianhua vs. Yan Jingjiang, and Huang Zhifang vs. Mao Yuwen. The Wei sisters may have a separate doubles performance at a later date for practice. The details of yesterday's match are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Wei Maigu Wins Against Su Jianhua: Wei Maigu and Su Jianhua encountered each other, and the competition was very fierce. Wei is short, nimble, and lively, while Su holds her composure and fights calmly. In the initial rounds, each excelled with their sharp serves, forming an alternating situation, going back and forth, with no clear winner. After each winning two games, Wei danced around the court, getting everything right, taking three games, making the score five to two, and victory was in sight. Su was unwilling to fall behind and retaliated, taking back two games. However, the momentum had already shifted, and the last game was won by Wei. The first set ended with a score of six to four, with Wei taking the lead. Switching sides to fight again, the first game was won by Su with her serve. After the second game, Wei gritted her teeth and swallowed three games in one breath, making the score three to zero. Su then gained one game, gradually becoming discouraged, while Wei remained heroic. This set was again won by Wei with a score of six to three. Su's skills are also considerable, but she is considered to be too calm, leading to her defeat.</p>
<p>Wei Zutong Wins Against Huang Zhifang: Seeing that her younger sister had already won, the elder Wei sister's heart blossomed, and she stepped onto the court with a smile. Seeing Su retreat in defeat, Huang was also cautious and careful, entering the court to compete. One came from Southeast Asia, and the other was a veteran of Shanghai. Each was wary and did not dare to be negligent. At the start, Wei served first, winning the first game with a score of four to one. Her momentum was quite fierce. Huang calmed down and tried hard to cope, then won three games in a row, turning defeat into victory. The fifth and sixth games were again won by Wei, making the score three to three. Then Huang won two more games, and victory was in sight, winning with six to four. In the second set, the elder Wei sister was determined to seek revenge, winning six games in a row. Her interception at the net showed considerable skill, and her backhand stroke was especially appropriate. Huang then pulled back one game, followed by two more losses, so Wei won with a score of six to one. After each winning one set, the two sides rested for a moment and then went back into action. The outcome depended entirely on this moment. Each dealt with all their strength, and their strength was equal, creating a five-five situation. The performance was quite exciting. The last two games were won by Wei, ending with a score of seven to five.</p>
<p>Mao Yuwen Wins Against He Zuohui: The battle between Mao and He began at the same time as the Wei and Huang match. He's defeat was expected. However, Miss Mao's performance yesterday was mediocre and uneventful, perhaps because she did not meet a worthy opponent.</p>
<p>There are two singles matches today. Although Su Jianhua and Huang Zhifang lost yesterday, their performances were quite exciting. The Wei sisters also won with effort. Moreover, because Liang Peiyu did not appear, Yan Jingjiang is still participating. Therefore, there will be two more groups playing today: Su Jianhua vs. Yan Jingjiang, and Huang Zhifang vs. Mao Yuwen. Su and Huang both have the possibility of winning and still have hope of being selected to attend the National Games.</p>
<p>Su Jianhua vs. Yan Jingjiang, 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Huang Zhifang vs. Mao Yuwen, 2:00 PM.</p>
<p>Lin Baohua vs. Wang Wenzheng in the Singles Quarterfinals Today; Doubles Quarterfinals Not Held Yesterday</p>
<p>The Shanghai Lawn Tennis Club's senior singles quarterfinals will be held this afternoon starting at 1:30 PM at the French Chamber of Commerce. There will be a total of four groups. Wang Wenzheng vs. Lin Baohua is the most watched match. After Wang witnessed Qiu Feihai's loss, he believes, based on his progress, that he may be able to defeat Lin Baohua. Karlsen vs. Deffaux will also be a fierce battle. The schedule is as follows:</p>
<p>Lin Baohua vs. Wang Wenzheng, 1:30 PM.</p>
<p>Deffaux vs. Karlsen, 4:00 PM.</p>
<p>You Sheng Charity Sports Meet to be Held in Shen Garden This Morning</p>
<p>The You Sheng Travel Group's Sports Department-organized charity sports meet, originally scheduled to be held in Shen Garden on the 11th, was postponed due to rain. After consultation, it was rescheduled for this morning at 9:00 AM at the same location. It will be divided into open and member groups. Open performances will not require tickets. Famous players joining include Lin Shaozhou, Wang Zhenglin, Wang He, Jia Lianren, Tao Yingjie, and others.</p>
<p>Educational News: After Arriving in Beijing, Zeng Sheng Will Fly West to Take Office as Dean of the Agricultural College of Sichuan University</p>
<p>(Nanjing, 14th Dispatch) Ren Hongjun hired Zeng Sheng as Dean of the Agricultural College of Sichuan University. Zeng arrived in Beijing on the 14th from Qingdao and is scheduled to fly to Wuhan on the 15th to transfer to Sichuan.</p>
<p>American Scout Representatives to Return Home; Attending Camp in Seattle; Will Visit National Games in Shanghai Before Returning to Their Teams</p>
<p>According to news from the Municipal Boy Scout Council, a group of representatives from our country who went to the United States to participate in the American Boy Scout 25th Anniversary Celebration, led by Yan Jialin, the founder of the Boy Scouts of China, set off for the United States on July 23rd and arrived in Seattle on August 2nd, where they were warmly welcomed by local overseas Chinese. Later, due to the polio epidemic near Washington, President Roosevelt ordered the conference to be stopped. Our Boy Scouts returned to Seattle and participated in camping nearby, with excellent results, earning high praise. It is now known that the representatives will return to Shanghai in October to visit the National Games and then go their separate ways. It is reported that the representatives were selected from Boy Scouts in Shanghai, Beijing, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Hubei, Hebei, Ping, and other provinces and cities, totaling 13 people. The representatives from Shanghai were Chen Haiguang from Guangzhao Yixue, Zu Xun from Fudan High School, and Yang Xunshi from Nanyang Model School, among others. The team leader is Yan Jialin.</p>
<p>Little Men (46) Originally Written by Ms. Louisa May Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang (Zonghai)</p>
<p>Nat then led him to the barn and introduced him to his companions, who were perched high in the loft, using hay to make a large circle on the wide floor below, with a small bridge in the middle. Tommy, armed with a long whip, rode the very hardworking donkey, Topsy, circling around as if playing the role of a monkey.</p>
<p>"Each of you has to pay a needle, or you can't watch the show," said Fatty, standing next to a small cart with the band sitting on it. Ned was playing a comb-like instrument, and Rob would occasionally beat a small copper drum when he arrived.</p>
<p>"He's a guest, so I'll pay two shares," Nat said generously, and immediately inserted two bent needles into the dried mushrooms, which served as their cash box.</p>
<p>We first nodded to these urchins' companions, then sat on a wooden plank, and then many programs proceeded in sequence. After the monkey trick, Ned displayed his martial arts, first jumping over several high chairs, then imitating a sailor's style, running up and down three tall ladders, followed by a nimble pirouette by Bridge, but still with a solemn and dignified demeanor. They then urged Nat to wrestle with Fatty, and after only a few moves, they dragged the puffed-up youth to the ground. After this was done, Tommy proudly stepped forward and did a somersault in the air. This skill was acquired through long and arduous practice, often practicing alone until every joint in his small body was bruised. His companions, seeing his superb martial arts, couldn't help but admire and applaud. His face was flushed, and he was happily complacent, just as he was about to rest, when he suddenly heard a light voice from the audience saying:</p>
<p>"Bah! That's nothing!"</p>

<p>Spot Gold Market Peaceful; Exchange Market Tightens then Loosens; Results Only Up Two Cents</p>
<p>The gold market was extremely mediocre yesterday, and the exchange market tightened and then loosened. The swap rate was low and then high, causing it to initially rise and then fall.

Qian Changxiang Yanfeng Yong Dacheng Hengyu Yiyu Fuxing, as well as scattered shorts, moved up one after another, forcing the close to fall to 2.9 yuan. After the market closed, it initially retreated to 2.78 yuan due to scattered shorts moving up. Fuyu Tong Taichang Hengchang Yongli and others came to move out again, and finally rose back to over 3.5 yuan.</p>

<p>Securities and Bond Market Still Depressed, Prices Slightly Up by Five Cents to Two Angles</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange market was still extremely sluggish. The market's sluggishness was obvious, and there was no improvement. Especially due to the weekend, various gangs had little trading. The market had slightly more trading for 76 and 70 buying in, and 5, 10, and 71 selling out, slightly embellishing the market. The rest was rare. There was no way for both long and short positions to be closed, and they could not be swapped. It was not easy to change the market. The market believed that most of them would eventually be listed, and there was a possibility of squeezing more. However, since a large number of hedges could not be swapped, they would be slightly replenished. Therefore, even if there were highs and lows in the future, they still could not escape the disk-bound market. The range was relatively large. Yesterday, due to Japan's statement to prevent Britain from lending to China, the market sentiment was slightly tired, but the market price only increased by one or two angles. The front row in the second round seemed to continue to be small, and the back row was slightly stronger. The fluctuations were still minimal. In the afternoon's two rounds, the transactions were even clearer, completely rotating around one angle. The market became more depressed. The final results of the market prices were mostly small, with a turnover of about five cents to one angle. The total number of transactions was 4.46 million yuan. The increase or decrease in results are compared and listed on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>
<p>American Copper, Steel, and Iron Stocks Reported to Rise -- Signs of War</p>
<p>Xinfeng Trading Company reported that yesterday (the 13th), the New York stock market was mixed. It was expected that domestic copper would rise, so copper stocks rose by ten. Steel stocks also rose, as it was expected that the working rate of steel mills would continue to increase. Although railway freight transport decreased, railway stocks were quite strong. The bond market was mixed, and U.S. government debt was slightly lower. Small transactions in stocks stopped rising. The total daily transaction volume was 1.73 million shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>
<p>Cotton Yarn Warehouse Chips Slightly Increased; Yarn Market Suffered Again</p>
<p>The yarn market continued to be suppressed, and the situation became increasingly exhausted. This was because the overseas cotton situation continued to decline, and the market sentiment was depressed. Although the long side of this month was pulling up prices and not letting go, a certain bank's hedged yarn (16s and 17s) had already released 1,700 bales into the warehouse. As a result, the market was greatly affected, and the surface was relatively loose. However, the large-scale purchases by vegetable companies slightly recovered the downward trend. In short, the financial problem was not very active.</p>
<p>Standard Yarn Long Position:</p>
<p>The spot market for standard yarn opened, and the market was flat and sluggish. Because overseas cotton prices were trending down, most people were pessimistic. However, trading in the market was quite quiet, and the market sentiment was very scattered, so the rise and fall were minimal. A certain company continued to buy in every round, and Japanese companies continued to release far-month contracts in this month. As a result, the price of each month fell by 1.4, 5, and 6 angles compared to the closing price of the previous day. When the afternoon market opened, the downward trend started again, and each month belonged to the downward trend. However, a certain company still bought, and securities also came to buy. The virtual air was slightly restrained by it. The price rose a few angles in the second and third rounds. As a result, each month fell by 1, 2, and 3 angles compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Shenji sold 850 bales, Renfeng 500 bales, Yuanda 350 bales, Taichang 1,090 bales, Yichang 1,100 bales, Changfeng 550 bales, Runkang 450 bales, and Dafeng 400 bales. Senkang 450 bales entered Dafu at 1,550 bales, Chang 400 bales, Hexing 1,000 bales, Gengfeng 300 bales, Shengyuan 300 bales, Tonghe 400 bales, and Deji</p>

<p>observation, nor can it bring an object or a person vividly to life. As for recording the goods piled up in the window cabinets, that is even more like guessing riddles, with no great use. Moreover, even such mechanical and foolish methods cannot be implemented by ordinary young people because they don't have the time, nor would they be so foolishly obsessed; those who can do that are probably only those with money and leisure, and these people would never deliberately seek trouble to do those stupid things. Therefore, although these methods of the "educator" are very "practical," they are in vain. Furthermore, the other two conditions for seeking knowledge, "memory" and "record," are also mediocre; moreover, the author's explanation is not profound, and in some places, he even deviates from the topic to talk about some fragmented technical matters in an attempt to accumulate more words. For example, in "record," the author goes from the word "record" to the record of private expenses, but these are not the main content of explaining how to seek useful knowledge. If we were to talk about the main characteristics of this book, in addition to saying that it is a technical and superficial study, we can also point out that it is intended for those who want to make a fortune, in reality, everything it says is about how to make money and how to climb to the upper class. Here, let us casually quote a passage from the book: "You should be like someone in business, with a plan for your promotion, paying attention to the steps that must be taken. While you are faithfully doing all the duties of your position, you may as well study the next level of responsibility, and train yourself to be able to assume these responsibilities. That is using your intelligence." In addition, there are many other arguments, such as how to climb to the position of bank president or store general manager, how to increase one's income, etc., which cannot be listed one by one. However, in this year of increasingly developing economic panic, when all production is declining, the living conditions of most people are deteriorating, even if the average frustrated young person is very diligent and good at training themselves, it may not be easy to climb up. As for those who are already in high positions, I dare say that their knowledge of how to climb even higher is definitely more abundant than that of the "educator"; the "educator's" "how to train yourself" is simply "teaching a monkey to climb a tree" for them!</p>
<h3>The Amateur Coffee Shop Acts According to Circumstances by Lu Junping</h3>
<p>Things should be done smoothly, and words should be spoken beautifully, so that no matter how big or small the matter, or how much or little the words, there will never be conflicts, and one can also benefit everywhere! He who understands the times is a great man. This saying has been rampant in both the government and the public in recent times; therefore, clever and capable people handle affairs without failing to act according to circumstances. There is a warning on the social scene that says, "Don't talk about state affairs, only talk about romance." When storms arise on the political stage, there is news in the newspapers that says, "A certain magnate is quietly observing the changes in the situation and does not want to express his opinion," or "A certain general's attitude is unclear." In the foreign concession, when petty hooligans fight, they watch carefully for an opportunity to deliver a punch in the crowd and slip away, or if they see a pretty young woman walking alone, and see that there is an opportunity, they may as well "do that" too. All of this is what great men who understand the times do, and it is also a manifestation of "acting according to circumstances." Writing this, I remembered a story I knew well from my childhood. The story says: A certain large landowner's rent collector, Mr. Li, went to Zhang San's house to collect rent every year, and Zhang San always entertained him with a whole fresh chicken cooked in a delicious way. This had been the custom for several years. But times changed, and in recent years, there were famines and disturbances, which forced Zhang San's family to become much worse off than before. Once, Mr. Li came to collect the rent, and although Zhang San still entertained him with food, a rooster still cost about one yuan, and Zhang San planned to abolish this custom in order to save money. Mr. Li saw that the wine had been flowing for several rounds, but the chicken had not yet come up, and he was very unhappy, so he recited a crooked poem: "Every year when collecting rent, there must be chicken, but this year when collecting rent, there is no chicken. This field will not be planted by Zhang San—" Before he finished reciting, Zhang San was greatly frightened and hurriedly went to the kitchen to instruct his wife to tie up a live chicken and serve it to the guest. When Mr. Li saw it, he continued to recite: "If not with Zhang San, then with whom?" Zhang San then laughed loudly and said to Mr. Li: "Mr. Li, why are the words you recited so different before and after?" Mr. Li smiled and said: "The first three sentences are called 'nonsense (a homophone for chicken),' and the last sentence is 'acting according to circumstances (also a homophone for chicken).'" Zhang San was silent. Mr. Li left with the chicken. This story is both joking and cruel, but in today's world, those who change their words and deeds when they see a chicken are everywhere. Today, I saw an old man discussing the Yellow River flood with news reporters in a calm manner. The old man did not lament the heavens or pity the people, nor did he question the lack of human efforts to control the water or prevent disasters, but he resentfully said that Xia Yu was a speculator who did not control the water well, causing endless harm to this day. Whether Xia Yu was a speculator or not, we will not discuss for the time being, but it is not good to criticize the important people and dignitaries of today, so he had to scold the four-thousand-year-old corpse of Xia Yu, which can be considered "acting according to circumstances" in comparison. Also, a year ago, a hundred boxes of opium were seized somewhere, and the people and the goods were detained together. This huge smuggling case caused a sensation far and wide. The next day, it was suddenly said that the contents of this box had been examined by a certain place and found not to be opium, and the people and boxes were released together. The newspapers competed to publish the news because the matter was so bizarre. However, this public case involves heavenly secrets, and we really cannot determine whether it is "nonsense" or "acting according to circumstances."</p>
<h3>Selling Old Age by Lin</h3>
<p>Fengjie in "Dream of the Red Chamber" complained: "...It's a pity I'm a few years younger. If I had been born twenty or thirty years earlier, these old people wouldn't think I haven't seen the world." Mrs. Jiujin in "Storm" was also knocking on the leg of a stool with a broken banana leaf, angrily saying: "I've lived to seventy-nine years old, I've lived enough, I don't want to see these prodigal scenes—it's better to die. It's almost time to eat, and they're still eating fried soybeans, eating the whole family poor!" It can be seen that selling old age did not start today; women and children also sell old age; those who are truly old can, of course, "rely on their age to sell old age." As for when something happens in the country, one must sell old age for a while: three elders send telegrams, two elders make declarations, and there are also "veterans" running around north and south. When the common people look at the changes in the situation, they only need to see if those political elders have any actions. If a writer's work is commented on by an old man of the ×× type, it is guaranteed to become popular and widely circulated throughout the country. Therefore, selling old age should also occupy a place in the art of climbing the ladder. Furthermore, the chairman of ×××× is not qualified to hold the position of ×××× unless he is an old man of "high age and virtue." Article 56 of the draft constitution states: "Members and alternate members of the ×× Committee shall have the following qualifications: (1) Be at least forty-five years old..." Isn't this even more worthy of special mention? Although the ways of selling old age are different, they are never restricted by time and space. For example, Guangzhou, far away on the coast of the South China Sea, once held a city-wide elder gathering. Mr. Liu, the mayor, actually sat side by side with the elders, eating cornbread and taking photos. Also, Sai Jinhua, who had been living in Beijing for a long time, was actually interviewed by a news reporter like interviewing a celebrity of the Party and the country. This is precisely because "old palace maids are still here, sitting idly and talking about Xuanzong." Old people are always worthy of attention. Also, although Yang Xiaolou is old, many people watch him when he performs on stage. The people who watch say: "If we don't watch now, we won't have the chance to watch anymore." Some people said before, "Kill all the old people in China first, and then China can be saved." I don't understand what this means. Is "old" not good enough? Or has "selling old age" lost its prestige?</p>

<p>Most of the overseas Chinese in the United States are from Guangdong. Their distribution and numbers are as follows:</p>
<p>New York 15,000 people Boston 2,000 people Philadelphia 1,500 New Orleans 600 people Chicago approximately 3,000 people Along the Mississippi River 2,000 people In addition, there are many overseas Chinese along the Pacific coast, such as San Francisco and Seattle. The main occupations of these overseas Chinese are peddlers, laundry workers, miners, tailors, farmers, tea boys, and waiters. They maintain their old Chinese customs in many places. The famous "Chinatown" is the place where overseas Chinese gather, but on this street, not only are the forms of many shops Chinese-style, but also the living habits of the overseas Chinese living here still maintain many of the so-called bad Chinese habits. Such as not being clean, liking to drink and eat, gambling, and loitering are fully demonstrated here; especially gambling, which can be said to be a common habit of the overseas Chinese here. All kinds of Pai Gow, silver cards, and mahjong are available here. Therefore, many compatriots often lose badly due to "unlucky gambling," and end up with empty pockets after a lifetime of hard work. Of course, there are also a few who are "lucky" and make a fortune through gambling, becoming wealthy men. However, recently, like</p>

<p>Page 29</p>
<p>New York's "Tang People" are comparatively better, overseas Chinese have gradually corrected some of the bad habits. if they continue to improve, then they'll be more helped in the future. Mexico To the south of the US, there are progressively less overseas Chinese, but the Mexican overseas Chinese are more. Based on statistics in 1910, there were 13,200 people in Mexico, and by 1931 it increased to nearly 20,000 people. Originally, according to the China-Mexico Commercial Treaty of 1899, all people of both countries should have the freedom to travel and reside, to engage in industry and commerce, and to receive most-favored-nation treatment. But recently, the Mexican local governments and some of the people have been repelling the overseas Chinese in various ways, prohibiting Chinese-Mexican people from intermarrying, and abolishing the rights that overseas Chinese have always had in Mexico, causing great suffering to our 20,000 to 30,000 compatriots in Mexico. It's really sighing! Canada Canada, north of the United States, is one of the five major dominions of Great Britain. In 1858, many overseas Chinese in the Americas went to Canada after hearing that gold mines had been discovered in British Columbia. By 1870, because Canada was developing gold mines and building railways and urgently needed manpower, even more Chinese from Australia, the United States and elsewhere went there. However, not long after, Canadian parliamentarians saw that the so-called Mongoloid people were entering the country in increasing numbers. In 1886, they decided to implement a head tax on Chinese people, $50 per person; in 1901, the head tax was increased to $100 per person; in 1904, it was increased to $500 per person; and later, the entry of Chinese laborers was absolutely prohibited. Since then, the number of overseas Chinese in Canada has not increased much. But according to a survey in 1911, there were still 27,774 overseas Chinese in Canada. Among them, there were the most workers, and there were fewer merchants and students. There are several Chinese Associations and overseas Chinese schools here. There is an organization of Chinese laborers, which is well-organized and has a strong cohesive force. We cannot but say that the reason why Chinese laborers can still maintain a considerable position in Canada is because they have a very solid organization. Central America There are many overseas Chinese in Central American countries such as Panama, Guatemala, and Costa Rica. Among them, there are the most workers, followed by merchants. But generally speaking, the economic situation of the overseas Chinese in Central America is better. In Panama, there are clubs and libraries, and the overseas Chinese have a very good mutual affection and concept of the motherland. They rarely interact with local people. Even less intermarriage. The overseas Chinese in Guatemala are slightly different. They love to get close to the locals and marry local women as wives. Overseas Chinese in Central America are also subject to discrimination, such as Panama's ban on Chinese and Turkish people entering the country, which is a clear example. (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Movie News: The Secrets of the Song and Dance Troupe: Gong Qiuxia Causes a Scene Backstage</h3>
<p>Originally a scene from "Parents and Children"</p>
<p>In recent years, due to the increasing severity of the economic panic, even the paper-obsessed and gold-drunken song and dance troupes have been affected by the economic downturn and have been facing dissolution trends. A few days ago, a large theater on the sea hired a certain song and dance troupe to perform on stage. After several days of public performances, the box office sales declined day by day. The theater manager and the leader of the song and dance troupe, Ms. So-and-so, were deeply worried. One day, Ms. So-and-so, the leader, suddenly became profit-minded and ordered all the actresses to cover their bodies with silver powder to perform "Silver Nude Portraits," which caused resentment among all the actresses. Ms. Gong Qiuxia, the leading actress of the troupe, strongly opposed it and explained the great righteousness to Ms. So-and-so, the leader. The leader was not only unmoved, but also uttered hurtful words, which aroused public outrage. Gong Qiuxia couldn't bear it either and sternly rebuked, saying, "We have sacrificed the happiness of our youth for food and clothing, but we have not sacrificed our personality... Song and dance are originally very noble arts, but they have all been messed up by you... Like this, we would rather starve to death than do it..." In a rush, Gong Qiuxia and a group of beautiful actresses all left the backstage one after another. Ms. So-and-so, the leader, was overwhelmed by the public's power and messed things up, she could only regret it. If you want to know the details, please read the sound maiden work of Cultural Film Company, "Parents and Children". Ms. Gong Qiuxia, who is the most prestigious song and dance artist in our country, plays a oppressed woman who enters the song and dance troupe due to natural and man-made disasters in "Parents and Children". She makes a real play out of the fake, and the fake play out of the real, so the performance is very profound and moving?</p>

<h3>Men's Volleyball Quarterfinals: District Two Defeats District Eight, Result 3-0, Performance Very Exciting</h3>
<p>The District Two versus District Eight volleyball quarterfinal was held yesterday morning at the volleyball West Field. Everyone was raring to go, ready to battle. Referee Shen Huichun sat alone on the high platform, with Chen De serving as his assistant. With a whistle, District Two gained the first serve. They scored nine points in quick succession, startling District Eight, who had little chance to retaliate. District Two's Wang Deyuan missed a spike, resulting in a self-inflicted point. District Eight gained the serve, but due to uneven formations, it was difficult to counterattack. Subsequently, District Three, with a score of eleven to four, gained the right to switch sides. District Two's Wang Deyuan, Chen Xuerong, and Gao Derong worked seamlessly together, until the score reached fifteen to eight. Although District Eight's Zhuo Guorong and Chen Jinzhi stood out like cranes among chickens, their heroism had no place to be used. The back-and-forth, the ping-ponging of the ball, produced endless excitement. The audience's cheers shook the sky. District Two's Wang Deyuan, with his high jumping ability, spiked the ball to a score of twenty-one to ten, winning the first game. In the ensuing battle, District Two's momentum was fierce. District Eight's Zhang Qishou and Chen Jinzhi returned the favor, creating a score of eight to three. However, due to a moment of carelessness, the three-row defense was breached. District Two gained the serve, and persevered, again gaining the right to switch sides. At that time, both sides dedicated their skills, and the atmosphere was tense. At one point, the score was tied at sixteen each. District Two's defense was solid, saving many dangerous balls. They then launched a full-force attack, winning the second game with a score of twenty-one to seventeen. After a lemon break, they switched sides and fought again. Unfortunately, District Eight's rear defense was weaker, making it difficult to cope. Later, Zhuo Guorong served, scoring two points in a row. However, District Eight's own players deferred to each other for the sake of the country. District Two's Deyuan flew onto the net, causing District Eight's rear defense to collapse like fallen flowers and flowing water. There was even a moment of close combat, which can be said to be one of the highlights of the volleyball match. District Eight once turned the situation around with a score of ten to twelve. Zhuo Guorong and Chen Jinzhi smiled happily, wielding their big swords and axes, chasing the score to thirteen to sixteen. District Two's Chen Xuerong set the ball perfectly for Tiger Wang Deyuan, and the short but sturdy Weng Li tirelessly killed the ball, breaking through three barriers in a row. Finally, they won the third game with a score of twenty-one to thirteen. As a result, District Two won three to zero.</p>

<p>Marine Doubles: District One against District Four, 3-0, District One wins. District Two against District Five, 3-0, District Two wins. The two teams will compete in the final on the 15th.</p>
<p>Singles Semifinals</p>
<p>District Two's Chen Fan defeats District One's Wang Yuanchen.</p>
<p>After two days of elimination, the singles competition has entered the semifinal week. District Two's Chen Fan and District One's veteran Wang Yuanchen competed for a spot in the final at 9:00 AM on the first court. The referee was Feng Jiasheng.</p>
<p>After the start of the first set, Chen Fan repeatedly used long shots to both corners, making Wang Yuanchen exhausted. Although the veteran tried hard to fight, he was ultimately limited by his age, making it difficult to run. The balls he hit often lacked strength, lightly sending away the first set with a score of 0-6.</p>
<p>In the second set, Yuanchen still showed no improvement, losing four games in a row. In the fifth game, Old Wang tried hard to fight, winning back one game. However, the good times did not last long, and he quickly lost two more games, sending away the second set with a score of six to one. Starting from the third set, Old Wang, after a period of rest, had a renewed spirit. He often came forward to intercept the net, putting Chen Fan in a difficult battle. He took the lead with a score of five to two. Chen Fan, suffering this setback, quickly became cautious, repeatedly using line shots, winning back three games, making the score five to five, seven to seven. Subsequently, Little Chen often hit close balls, making Old Wang exhausted, and won the third set with a score of nine to seven.</p>
<p>District One's Huang Shijing defeats District Two's Hu Guang.</p>
<p>The men's singles tennis District One A versus District Two B semifinal was held at 9:00 AM yesterday morning on the third court. Both sides had excellent tennis skills. At the start of the game, Hu served, making two mistakes, allowing Huang to win without effort. Subsequently, Huang won three more games in a row. Hu won the fifth and sixth games. Huang then won another game, winning the first set. At the start of the first set, Hu vigorously hit the ball. When the score reached three to two, Hu made many self-inflicted errors again. Huang won the second set. After that, Hu worked harder to save the situation, and his talent was slightly revealed, making many contributions, and won the first set. The hope of winning the final was slightly glimmering. After the break, the battle resumed. At this time, the wind suddenly became stronger, affecting the strength of both sides. Although Hu cheered himself up, he was ultimately tricked by Huang, running east and west, his voice hoarse and exhausted. Although he had the intention to retaliate, he had no strength to win, and Huang won the fourth game again.</p>
<h3>Women's Doubles Tennis: District Three and District Eight Final, Districts Five and Six Forfeit</h3>
<p>The women's tennis doubles teams from Districts Five and Six forfeited. The final on the 15th will be between Districts Eight and Three.</p>
<p>Singles Semifinals</p>
<p>District Eight wins District Three Women's Singles First Semifinal: District Three versus District Eight. District Two player Wu Huiying and District Eight player Dou Zhiyun. Miss Wu is a student at Suzhou Huiling Middle School. Although her tennis skills are not bad, she ultimately cannot escape the circle of weakness. Miss Dou has dark skin and is full of energy, presumably because she usually spends time with the sun. Dou serves quickly and her high-pressure shots are extremely powerful. She easily won the first set with a score of six to two. At the beginning of the second set, Wu was still under the control of Dou's racket. Sometimes Wu had one or two beautiful shots, but Dou did not give her a chance afterwards. Wu could only sigh in despair. Wu's cheerleaders constantly cheered her on. Two to six in the second set, she lost again. The referee was Cai Shaokui.</p>
<p>Zhiyun (District Eight) Wu Cunzaiying (District Three)</p>
<p>Women's Singles First Semifinal: Mao against Mao (i.e., District Five versus District Three). District Five forfeited, and District Three won.</p>
<h3>Track and Field Finals Results</h3>
<p>1500 Meter Final</p>
<p>Held at 2:50 PM. Wang Yanfa took the lead immediately after the start. Wu Hanzhang and Luo Kezhao followed behind. Veteran Jin Zhongkang, after running 400 meters, unhurriedly chased out from the crowd and occupied the second position, closely following Wang Yanfa. After 800 meters, Jin Zhongkang gradually took the lead and occupied the first position. Wang Yanfa once competed with him, but ultimately his strength was slightly inferior. Jin still led by a difference of ten meters. He Baoshan tried hard to compete for second place, Wu Hanzhang was third, and Ren Jia tried hard to cheer him on, occupying fourth place. When they reached the straight line, He Baoshan especially cheered himself on, and even had the potential to chase out Old Jin. Old Jin did not dare to be negligent and ran forward with all his might. He Baoshan retreated to second place by a difference of more than one meter. The result was four minutes and twenty seconds, breaking the provincial record by more than eleven seconds, which can be said to add luster to the conference.</p>
<p>Men's 200 Meter Final</p>
<p>Only six people participated in the men's 200-meter final. This was Cheng Jinguan's forte. He took the lead from the start and maintained it to the end, breaking the provincial record of 24.2 seconds with 24.1 seconds. However, Cheng's own record has regressed. It is said that his leg injury has not yet healed. Zeng Rongzhong originally had hopes for the runner-up, but ultimately finished fourth. It is said that he was also feeling unwell, but he told people that he was preparing to break Old Cheng's record in the 400-meter final, so he was not very nervous.</p>
<p>Women's 100 Meter Final</p>
<p>A total of six people participated in the women's 100-meter final. Districts Two and Three competed for the championship. Wu Juxin was indeed extraordinary, showing the remaining power of her 50-meter championship, and won the first place. Pang Yuanyu had been feeling unwell for several days, and all the competitions were affected, so she had to retreat to the runner-up. The women were narrow-minded, and did not want to take pictures after the game. After the referee persuaded them, they finally took a photo.</p>
<p>Men's Triple Jump</p>
<p>More than 20 people participated. District Eight's Wu was refined but not numerous, and District Two's talents were average. Each item was thinking of getting involved. District Eight's Liu Zhong jumped the most and won the championship. The performance was difficult to break the record in the end. District Three's Wang Guozhen was second, District Two's Jiang Huairen was third, and District Five's Sun Baoshan was fifth.</p>
<p>Women's Discus Throw</p>
<p>The women's discus throw final was held at 2:20 PM. A total of 23 people participated. After three trial throws, Han Caiming, Feng Yuzhen, Shi Huai, Shao Weirong, Sun Defang, and Liu Guihong, six people with better results, participated in the final. Han Caiming had already achieved a result of 21.59 meters in the preliminary round. She failed to break it in the final, and the rest also failed to exceed it. Miss Han then steadily won the championship. Feng Yuzhen had achieved a result of 22 meters in the final, but it was invalidated due to a foul, which was a pity. Among the people, Miss Feng's posture was the most accurate. If she was given time, it would not be difficult to break the national record. The results and rankings are as follows:</p>
<p>First Caiming 21.59 meters</p>
<p>Second Yuzhen 20.60 meters</p>
<p>Third Shao Weirong 20.30 meters</p>
<p>Fourth Guihong 19.54 meters</p>
<p>Men's Javelin Final</p>
<p>Held at 1:30 PM yesterday afternoon. More than 20 people participated, among whom Zhu Han, Chen Chaoshun, Dong Chengliang, etc. had the most outstanding results. In the trial throws, Zhu Han took the lead, and the rest could not reach him. The final six people, the results did not change much in the final, only District Two Dong Chengliang made slight progress.</p>

<h3>4x100 Meter Relay Final: District Three Lives Up to Expectations, Winning the Championship with 46.9 Seconds; District Four Pulls Off a Surprise, Taking Second Place</h3>
<p>The 4x100 meter relay final began at 11:20 AM. There were a total of five districts participating. District Three had strong athletes such as Cheng Jinguan, Jiang Youchen, Zhu Zhangling, and Wu Liben, with a strong determination to win. District Eight also had considerable strength, and Li Yanxiang and Zeng Rongzhong also intended to compete with District Three. Districts Four, Two, and One were all preparing to compete. As soon as the starting gun fired, District Three's Jiang Youchen took the lead, and District Eight's Liu Zhong and District Four's Huang Chengdong tried hard to catch up. In the blink of an eye, the 100 meters were completed, and District Three was ahead by about one meter. Wu Liben, after receiving the baton, did not dare to be negligent, and ran forward. Because District Eight was behind, it was surpassed by Districts Two and Four. District Three's Zhu Zhangling still took the lead, and District Four's Shen Zhenzhong worked exceptionally hard, surpassing District Two's Yang Laihai and taking second place. District Eight's Chen Tonghu was weaker, and had already fallen behind District Two by about one meter. For the fourth leg, District Three's Cheng Jinguan, after receiving the baton, ran like a flying comet, reaching the finish line, throwing out District Four by about five meters. Because District Four's two athletes ran well, they took second place. Although District Eight's Zeng Rongzhong was a strong athlete, he was only slightly inferior, and although he tried hard to cheer him on, he only surpassed District One to take third place. District Two lost to the fourth district by half a meter and was fourth. District One lost to District Two by 5 meters and failed to be selected. In this competition, District Three won as expected. District Four getting the Third and defeating District Eight was unexpected and surprised people.</p>
