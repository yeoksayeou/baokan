<p>英國會改選定下月十四日舉行</p>
<p>（倫敦）首相包爾溫今日午後在下院宣布總選舉定十一月十四日舉行、又稱、新國會定十一月二十六日開會選舉議長、英皇將於十二日二日蒞會舉行正式開幕禮、</p>
<p>今日午後下院復開會辯論國際局勢時、首相先起演說、謂昨日外相霍爾演說中所述及之工作、咸獲內閣全體團結之贊助、艾登駐日內瓦的、恒與倫敦之同僚接觸、諸人均贊同彼之行動、艾登將於今日午後在院演說、首相繼謂七星期之時事與昨日之辯論、巳證明政府之政策不特獲國人之贊助、且獲不列顚帝國全部之贊助、自治領曾毫不猶豫、麥加調整制裁之計畫、吾人現取行動唯一可能之途徑、即絕對忠於國聯盟約、而準備攫取任何合法機會、以解决意阿爭議是、此種解决、必須經意阿國聯三方面滿意、始稱公允、前國聯所易奏功者在今日之國聯、顯然為不可能、因世界最重要之三大强國、今置身於會外故也、目前爭案中所得之敎訓、已表明為世界和平計，吾人國防必須較今日所有者更為强固、渠非謂在實條土或想像上作片面的重整軍備之舉動、以對付任何一國、但謂在國聯機構範圍內增强國防力量耳、包氏末言苟渠無權以補救國防之缺陷、則渠不能担負任何政府之責任云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）擬用外交方法解决意阿紛爭之努力、今日仍在樂觀空氣中進行、英國駐意大使德魯蒙與意國外次蘇維區今日復晤談、「以謀改善環境、」外部發言人稱、英國外相霍爾昨日在下院之演說、意方尙須俟當局將其全文研究之後、始能發表意見、（二十三國民電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）駐羅馬英大使德魯蒙今日復與意外次蘇維志談話一小時、衆視此為一佳兆、但談話之性質未能向官方探悉、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<p>亞力山大里亞　英國戰艦五十一艘及運輸艦三艘、今日在此間港中集中、此事與意國繼續在利比亞邊境集中軍隊飛機及坦克車之消息殊為巧合、（二十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於英意兩國關係緩和辦法、英國有將大戰艦「雷囊」與「霍特」號兩艘、自直布羅陀海峽調回本國、意國則將駐紥利比亞軍隊撤退一部份之議、頃據本社訪員所得消息、英國海軍部專家對於調回軍艦一層、並不反對、但政府尙未作何决定、此事究應如何處理、當視現行談判進展情形以為斷、意國人士以為該國派往菲洲利比亞軍隊若須調回本國、則其所作犧牲、實較英國調回戰艦為大、緣地中海英國艦隊實力、仍遠較意國為優故也、此在英國海軍界則謂此種見解、並不確實、因「雷囊」號與「霍特」號兩艦、共計噸位八八萬噸、一旦敝退之後、則地中海上英國海軍所佔優勢、實微乎其微、關於此層、據官塲人士聲稱、國聯會各會員國政府當於十月三十一日將實施制裁所採措置、通知國聯會、英意兩國在此期間恐難成立恊定云、準此而論、官塲人士對於英意關係在最近數日原屬樂觀者、茲則深慮最後解决辦法、或須經過長時間之談判始可獲取矣、（二十三十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>直布羅陀港　西班牙魚雷艇「桑歇士號」「巴凱德基」號「伐爾德上將」號三艘、頃於晨間駛抵該國南部阿爾奇齊拉港、（卽在直布羅陀海峽）此外尙有他項軍艦、日內卽將開到、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）關於英國艦隊在地中海遭受襲擊時、要求法國加以援助一事、法國政府業於日前答復英國、此項復文迄未發表、外間所知者僅係大綱、頃據事業報載稱、復文內容約分兩部份、第一部份係追述法國政府曾於十月十四日、通知英國駐法大使克拉克、謂英法兩國對於國聯會盟約第十六條第三項所作解釋、完全脗合、卽主張英法兩國應在海陸空軍三方面相互援助、但國聯會旣僅决定實施經濟制踩、則上述援助、目前自應僅以實施此項經濟制裁為限、據事業報解釋、國政府復文之第一部份、乃在聲明法國雖可援助英國海軍、但以遭受意國海軍之無理侵略時為限、至復文第二部份、係申述英法兩國政府前此所進行之談判、僅限於討論經濟制裁辦法、其他關於封鎖蘇彝士運河或封鎖意國海口等問題、則並未考慮及之、復文未段、則提議由英法兩國開誠佈公進行談判、以解釋一切、使現有之不安局勢為之澄淸云、該報最後則謂、欲使英國有軍獲得法國援助、則必須國聯會各會員國一致通過而後可云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>自治領與法國將步後塵美對此舉目前不致考慮</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國政府明令禁止意大利船隻在英國各港口停泊二十四小時以上之後、官塲人士頃官宜稱、政府此舉係依照一九〇七年海牙國際中立公約行事、意國亦屬簽字國之一、自不致認為非友誼之行動、按英國對於此項公約所作解釋、共分三層、（一）意國貨船自英屬殖民地裝載糧食運往意屬伊里特里亞或運往索謀里蘭者、當視同軍艦、不許停泊至二十四小時以上、（二）英國各屬地出品、在實際上一律禁止搭載意國船隻、（三）意國船隻不許裝載軍用驢馬駱駝、緣英國官廳以為意國船隻在駛抵該國最近港口之前、此種驢馬駱駝非所必需自係作為軍用故也、（廿三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦現料英國諸自治領及法國將採用與英國相同之態度、實施一九〇七年海牙中立公約、（廿三日路透電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）國務院人員今日雖承認美國為一九〇七年海牙中立公約簽宇國之一、但表示美國未必卽能踵英國之後塵而對意阿實施該約條欵、據觀察家意見、美國距戰地甚遠、故美政府不致考慮將海牙公約之條欵列入其自己中立政策中、除非戰事蔓延於菲洲之外耳、（廿二日路透電）</p>

<p>（華盛頓）國務院今日接得國聯通知、請美國政府發表對於意阿問題之意見、當局以為該函實為間接請求美國聲明是否願與國聯合作之態度、據悉國務院對於此項通知、將加以詳細之研究、且於答覆國聯秘書處之前、將由羅斯福總統請求云、（廿二日國民電）</p>

<p>時評</p>
<h3 id="c10">最近之日蘇關係 <a href="#c10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>日「滿」軍與蘇聯軍於本月六日·八日及十二日在伯力附近發生衝突。互有死傷。事後蘇聯當局除抽調巡洋艦與潛水艦二十餘艘。集中伯力附近。陸軍二十萬人向滿洲里出動。以防日「滿」軍之再襲外。更訓令其駐日大使優列尼夫。向日本提出嚴重抗議。附帶要求組織混合委員會。以確定歷次邊境衝突之責任。偽「滿」當局乃與關東軍協商應付方策。聞將接受蘇聯之要求設置混合委員會。此事殆已漸趨和緩當不至遽爾引起重大結果也。</p>
<p>自九一八事變以來。日蘇間糾紛事伴層見疊出。迄今已達三百餘起。此等糾紛一張一弛莫不與世界政局及日本大陸政策有關。中東路非法賣買成立後。兩國邦交漸見和協。及至冀察事件發生。又呈緊張之象。越二月稍見平靜。今者意阿開戰歐局不安。德國之反蘇聯活動又正在積極進行。日「滿」此次向蘇挑釁。固未始非今日國際情勢所促動也。</p>
<p>日蘇兩國政體不同信仰互異。其在遠東本有針鋒相對之形勢。而日本之大陸政第。又須以反蘇聯為其指標。故兩國糾紛之演淮。勢必至訴諸武力而後已。第日本以準備尙未充足。雖躍躍欲試亦不敢輕舉妄動。必待包圍西伯利亞之弧形陣綫完成。對於大陸獲有較大之控制權。俾便戰時資源之取給後。始可與蘇聯抗爭。至於蘇聯則固無時無刻不在戒備之中。觀其第二五年計劃之將軍需工業重心置於烏拉山東。與陸軍之特別注重耐寒騎馬溜冰滑雪等訓練。可知一斑。祇以其經濟建設計劃亟待完成。而德國之東進野心尤須防範。故亦不願與日本輕啟戰端耳。</p>
<p>兩國之戰機今雖未見成熟。但國際政治之惡化與日本大陸政策之急進。隨時足使兩國糾紛日益加深。以致有引起戰爭之可能在此種危機之下。我國所處地位之因難。殊可想見殷願國人洞察國際政治之動態。蓄積民族之熟血與活力。以應付日後或將愈益惡化之難局。</p>
<h3 id="c11">剴切闡明英國立塲　霍爾清空辭概要 <a href="#c11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>力闢半單獨行動之謬說忠實擁護集體安全制</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國下議院改選在卽、本日午後二時、舉行最後一屆會議、討論外交政策、議塲聽衆、擁擠不堪、外相霍爾發表重要之演說、對於政府對外政第及意阿問題、均有詳細之說明、茲摘錄其演辭如下、</p>
<p>關懷和平不存私念</p>
<p>「英國為一廣大之世界帝國、故對於保持世界和平、無時不加以關心、英國對於阿比西尼亞事件、悉本此一念以行動、此外斷無帝國主義私念存乎其間、若以為英國欲乘機攻擊法西斯主義、則其荒謬不經、尤無待辭闢、各國均有權自行解决其政制問題、吾國尤不願干涉其他民族內政、</p>
<p>維護盟約唯一志願</p>
<p>吾人參加日內瓦之談判、其唯一志願、僅在維持國聯會盟約之原則而已、世人不加諒察、以為英國在日內瓦乃係單獨行動、則當知英國及英帝國各自治領出席國聯會之代表、於討論一切重大國際問題時、斷不能自居次要之地位、此為責職之所在、旣不容推諉、亦無所用其掩蓋、不幸日內瓦之談判、有時不能完全公開、</p>
<p>單獨行動無待辭闢</p>
<p>苟不然、則眞相大明、而所謂英國單獨行動之謬說、當不攻自破矣、此秤謬說、不僅厚誣英國、且有莫大之危險、蓋欲使歐洲陷於戰爭慘刦、其道未有善於此者、余復應鄭重聲明、不管部大臣艾登在日內瓦之行動、與余及內閣全體閣員、意見完全一致、並無絲毫軒輊於其間、</p>
<p>外交折衝始終不輟</p>
<p>至於外傳英國政府對於阿比西尼亞問題、行動過於邇緩、數月前意國曾要求說明對於阿比西尼亞問題之立塲、英國何、竟不答覆、實則此乃不明眞相之說、蓋自一九三四年年底以來、英國為阿此西尼亞問題、向意國有所折衝、始終不輟、至本年一月、法意兩國政府、成立羅馬恊定、阿比西尼亞問題、亦為其中之一部分、但法國除履行現有約束及法屬直布底至阿國京城之鐵道利益外、就經濟觀點而論、對於阿比西尼亞並不感興味、至本年一月二十九日意國政府始以法意羅馬協定全文、通知英國政府、並表示願與英國交換意見、俾使英意兩國在阿比西尼亞之利益、獲得相互諧和之發展、因當時意國提議、頗為認眞、英國政府乃立卽指派一委員會、負責對於英阿關係及英國在阿比西尼亞之利益、重行作通盤之研究、俾决定英國應採取之態度、然此種研究必就專家及人證多方諮詢、尤必向英埃蘇丹及英屬怯尼亞殖民地政府有所磋商而後可、由是可見英國對於意大利之建議、如不能及時答覆、則其故實由於意國對阿比西尼亞行動淮展過速、竟使英國政府不及以安閑審愼之態度從長計議也、</p>
<p>覓求解决兩不偏袒</p>
<p>至謂斯德里薩會議中、並末將阿比西尼亞問題列入議程、尤屬不確、當時英法意三國代表團、曾就該問題有所討論、彼時意國政府已完全明瞭英國之觀點、英國並表示希望意阿爭端、獲得友好之解决、可見從意阿爭端開始以來、吾人始終顯示英國之態度、不令意國有所懷疑、不僅英國為然、卽國聯各會員國、亦無一日、無一星期、不準備設法、使意阿爭端獲得榮譽之解决、今余乘此機會、當再加聲明意阿問題、必須在國聯會範圍以內、覓求解决之策、政府從未採取極端態度、對於意阿雙方、亦未作左右袒、下院諸君當均能憶及、不寗唯是、余敢自信負責政治家能提醒世人、承認意國有安全及經濟擴張之權利者、當以余為第一人、然欲求意阿問題之最後解决、必經國聯會及意阿三方面榮譽接受而後可、</p>
<p>制裁前留喘息餘地</p>
<p>今在經濟制裁發生實效之前、吾人尙有喘息之餘暇乘機進行談判議謀解决、安見其不可乎、且意大利今猶為國聯會員國、此為最可欣幸之一事、意大利不僅與吾人同為國聯會員國而已、且為吾人之老友、吾人之舊同盟國、若謂至此最後一小時、吾人不能再有機會覓求解决、對吾老友、除採取困難之經濟行動以外、必須採取更進一步之行動、又安見其必然乎、抑意阿問題、非僅東菲之局部爭端、而實為遠較重大之問題、對於此一問題之解決、是否尙有若干之希望、非余所知、然吾人之目光、遠矚人類之將來、吾人之志願、在維持集體行動之原則、故無論如何、吾人必仍希望恐怖之衝突、迅卽歸於終止、</p>
<p>集體安全重要試騐</p>
<p>至就軍事制裁而論、此必由日內瓦方面經集體恊定而後可、然此種集體慚定、則並未存在、從意阿爭端發生時起、吾人卽已宣佈、吾人雖已準備參加吾人分內之一切行動、但吾人之行動、要當以集體行動之範圍為限、「集體」二字必須特別加以注意、蓋「集體」者國聯會之靈魂也、法總理賴伐爾前在克萊芒斐朗所發表之演說中已言之、吾人並未向法國提議任何軍事措置、吾人今惟有一念、卽條約如繼續破壞、則國聯會以及吾人之文明、均不能繼續生存是也、目前吾人之困難、由於若干外國雖明知無兩全之道、而仍無應付事實之勇氣、彼等平時輒詆貢國聯會、謂其不能履行義務、然苟遇彼等須履行國聯會義務時則往往退避不遑、要之、吾人目前所作之偉大試騐、實為全世界數代未有之舉、集體安全之機構、今乃第一次見諸試行矣、苟試行而得其道吾人固不難坐視其成效、試行而不得其道、則凡主張不以戰爭為國家政策工具者、必咸將感受失望之重大打擊矣、苟此種試騐竟遭失敗、則凡抱動搖不定之態度以參加行動者、實應負重大之責任、總而言之、集體行動苟其可恃焉、吾人當加以認識、集體行動茍其可獲吾人之信賴焉、吾人亦當加以認識、茍如是、則忠實擁護集體安全制度者誰、口頭高呼擁護集體安全制度、而對於實施集體安全之國家反加以攻擊及挑釁者又為誰、吾人其庶幾有所識別焉」云云、（二十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>工黨新領袖發言</p>
<p>工黨新領袖艾特里起而發言、謂工黨之政策、以先國聯與整個世界的利益而後國家的利益之需要為根據、渠歡迎霍爾擁護國聯盟約之立塲、但不贊成英政府從前之消極、蓋目前地位、乃泰半成於中日爭議中之毫無舉動也、工黨贊成經濟制裁及國聯制度、但國聯今後必須成為一個賓有機關、渠主張英政府宜放棄從條約所許之任何特惠以消滅他人所抱英國對於阿國問題有特殊關係之種種疑愈、尼羅河水源應為國聯解决之事、埃及應許其解除目前與英國之關係、蘇丹應置於國聯代管之下、艾氏於是拼擊政府重事擴張軍備政策、謂工黨準備贊助履行英國對國聯義務所必要之軍備、伊不能以空白支票給予政府、工黨擬挾社會主義與和平之黨綱而赴投票所、蓋信二者實不可分離也云、</p>
<p>自由黨表示意見</p>
<p>繼薩繆爾爵士起稱、自由黨願贊助政府、並促國聯採行建設性之和平政第、而設置立補救痛苦之機構、薩氏關於此節、謂現九個政治單位分據世界四分之三、而其餘五十國僅佔世界四分之一、如日本德意諸國實際已被接於外、渠對此問題、主張亟覓一經濟的解决云、</p>
<p>藍斯堡結束辯論</p>
<p>前工黨頒袖藍斯堡由後列之席發言、謂今日文明所遭之經濟問題、不能以集體安全或武力解决之英國亟當作果敢慷慨之姿勢、邀請各國開一大會、籌議世界產品如何始能分配之計畫、並為表率而對衆宣言曰、「吾人願以所有置入共同分配物中」、辯論至是終止、定明日繼續開會、俾工黨得於星期四日、提出失業之彈劾動議（二十二日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）今日上院辦論外交事務時、諸發言者多對意國表示友好、黨爾大臣兼上院領袖倫登特里勳爵官述政府之政策、其言與外相霍爾在下院所發者大旨相同、上院工黨新領袖史納爾勳爵宣布工黨擬贊助政府、但僅以謀求集體安全為限、至對於政府之亟亟擴張軍備、實不能予以贊助云、保守黨彭旭斯特勳爵雖詆責竟國之侵略行動、但稱意國為「英之老友」而又抨擊阿政府之遲遲不廢奴制、及販運軍火、謂以阿比西尼亞委託一文明國代管、愈早愈佳云、一九一八至一九年充駐意英軍司令長官之加文伯爵發言稱讚意兵之勇武、歐戰前曾任陸相兩年之諾蒂斯通勳爵主張重施對阿軍火輸出禁令、（二十二日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）今日外相霍爾在下院所發之演說、歐陸皆為滿意、巴黎方面之印象極良好、盛讚其言之爽直明瞭與識見遠大、日內瓦方面雖亦滿意、但以外相未言及實施制裁前之「呼吸時間」應如何利用為憾、羅馬方面尙無正式之反響、但一般人士皆承認外相之言友好而溫和、由此可徵歐洲無發生戰事之可能性云、（廿二日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）半官方面對於英國外相霍爾昨在下議院所發表之演說、表示若干滿意、蓋解决意阿爭端、務當兼顧意大利之觀點與國聯會之基構、此層英國並無不贊同之處可於霍爾演說中見之也、至關於封鎖蘇彝士運河與意國海岸之兩端、霍爾重行聲明保證美國目前决不出此、則此間半官方面尤為欣慰、惟霍爾演詞中、堅决宣稱、英國當支持國聯會之集體行動、以施行對意制裁、則頗受此間人士之批評耳、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>阿京　據本社特派員奧柴納電稱、英國外相霍物昨日在下議院發表演說說明該國外交政第之後、此間官塲表示失望、緣此間對於英國、雖未期以軍事制裁、但猶望其提議半軍事性質之制裁故也、至國聯會對於意國、雖已决定各項經濟制裁敀段、但歐洲某某國若仍直接間接與意國繼續通商、則此項制裁手段能否生效、此間官塲亦表示悲觀云、（二十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>

<p>法報認為和解有望　意報批評出以冷嘲</p>
<p>（倫敦）英國報紙批評外相霍爾昨在下院所發之言論論調不一、每日電聞謂阿比西尼亞之戰事、旣仍操諸墨索里尼之掌握中、故外相言論之最重要一段、厥為外相直接向意國作有力之呼籲云、晨郵報稱、軍事制裁未經議及一說、至可歡迎、惟彙聞報則謂英政府似又作不澈底之政策、此種政策、一方面不寬恕破壞盟約之行為、一方面不能使侵略國就範云、每日驛報稱、我盯此番言論、不過證實一般人對於政府外交政策之焦慮與懷疑耳、泰晤士報稱、在忠實研究英國政策者觀之、外相全部言論中未有一句不表示眞相云、每日郵報謂許多人民現愈覺信任國聯、乃一錯云、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法國各報今日對英外相霍爾昨在下院所發之演說、均有評論、晨報謂此演說不特重行保證央國在意阿戰爭中將來所居之地位、且足使人心寬慰、視為此案和平可解决之嚆矢、惟有數報謂英外相之演說、乃鑒於總選舉舉行在卽、而藉以迎合人心者、（二十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意報之批評央外相霍爾昨發之言論者、僅有羅馬民報、但出以冷淡之語調、該報標題指此為「合於本國銷路之適當談話、」並謂意國現待英國表示公道之一言、而世界仍盼望切實的和平言論云、官塲方面對於英外相之言論、不置一詞、但意人大都更抱意阿爭議可獲解决、國聯制裁可不實施之希望（廿三日路透電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）據海軍界人士觀察、英國欲緩和因意阿爭端所造成之緊張形勢、其一部份原因、在於使意國得參加未來海軍會議、按英國政府對於限制海軍政策盼望甚切、查華盛頓及倫敦兩海軍條約、均將於明年年底滿期該兩條約曾規定於本年年底以前、召集海軍會議、因此英國於去年年底與美日兩國分別舉行海軍初步談話、並希望與法意兩國亦作此種談話、俾覓獲未來海軍條約之基礎、在去年英日美海軍初步談話中間、英國最初提出、（一）量的限制、（二）分級限制之兩項建議、嗣因日本拒絕加以考慮、乃又建議對於每艘軍艦之噸位及砲徑、規定質的限制、此外並由各海軍國相互通知造艦程序、此項建議已為美國所接受、但日本則附有條件、卽海軍總噸數之最高限度、應使日本與各國相等是也、至於意法兩國則尙未答復上項建議、最近英國因時間迫促、乃由外交途徑向各關係國接洽、傳於本年十二月二日召集預備會議、至明年一月結束、並主張此項會議、性質不必過於鄭重、與會各國可僅由駐英大使及海軍參贊參加會議、而不必特派代表、此間海軍界人士以為美國旣已接受英國建議、意法兩國不久亦可接受、故海軍協定能否成立、當視日本之態度而定、惟目前因意阿爭端、使英意兩國外交關係緊張、意國參加會議不免受其妨礙、英國所以亟欲緩和對意外交局勢、此卽其一原因云、（二十二日哈瓦斯社電）</p>

<p>主張一律採用按次收費辦法　商家住宅電話最初費用减低　報告書後附帶三項貢獻意見　華租長途通話應卽設法改善</p>
<p>電話專家報告書、業已發表、茲為讀老便利起見、爰將該報告書中建議諸點、擇其要者列舉如下、（一）上海電話公司已履行特許合同第五條之規定、卽應享受該合同第十三條第二項所規定營業投資上百分之八又百分之二之純利、並得自四月一日起開始加價、（二）公司一切關於機件設備、及其他產業上之支出、均屬合理、出之於審愼、並無逾份建築之嫌、（三）公司營業維持費用、大致均屬經濟合理、惟營業支出中普通業務二項、較之東方各公司為高、主張公司應更求支出上之撙節、如廣告兜銷費用等、並應於最高當局之外、多用當地技術人才、（四）為减輕小用戶擔負、及增進普通用戶功效起見、無論商家或住宅應一律採用含有基本通話次數在內之按次收費辦法、（五）話價之最重要主張、為商用電話、每月百五十次收費十元、額外每次三分、家用電話、每月一百次、每月六元五角、額外每次三分、（六）關於華租通話費、長途電話接綫辦法、及界外築路電話費三問題之意見、</p>
<p>公共租界工部局電話專家委員會關於電話加價問題報告書、已於前日夜間、由中·日·英·美·四國專家正式簽字、昨日呈交工部局董事會、茲特譯其大致、亟為公佈如下、</p>
<p>各專家姓名、中國胡瑞祥君·日本稻田三之助君·英國勃朗君美國雷氏、</p>
<p>該報告書第一節、首先摘錄工部局董事會前此所通過電話專家委員會調查電話事宜職業範圍、（見本年七月二十四日工部局公報）聲明依照調查範圍以內諸事項之次序、一一分別與以答覆、惟職業範圍內第三節、係以繼續維持現行無限制通話按具收費制為設想、而令專家擬訂價目表、故擬不予置議、此外範圍第一節內、計包含下列之諸事項、</p>
<p>（甲）上海電話公司是否有自一九三五年四月日起增加話費之權</p>
<p>（乙）該公司所有關於機件設備、及其他產業之支出、是否經濟、</p>
<p>（丙）該公司現有營業及維持費用、是否經濟合理、</p>
<p>範圍之第一節內、包含下列之諸事項、</p>
<p>（甲）商用電話或家用電話或其二者是否宜採用按次收費制、</p>
<p>（乙）倘按次收費制認為適當者、應採用何種價目表、俾該公司能獲得特許合同中所規定之純利、　報告書中、復涉及該特許合同之由來、緣上海電話公司、在未取得該項特許合同之前、曾有電話公司三家、爭欲取得此權、競爭頗為劇烈、其中以萬國電話電報公司、International　Telephongand　Telegraoh　Corporation即上海電話公司總公司）所提出之倏件為最優、遂由工部局給以持訂台同、以下即專家職業範圍內諸問題之答覆、</p>
<p>第一節、—甲、此問題在機械技術及經濟管理各方面觀之、除本報告書他處尙有詳細之意見發表外、專家委員會、對於該公司能於相當及實事求是之狀態內、履行特許合同中　五條之條件、卽應享有特許合同第十三條第二欵所規定價目表上之利益、該原文係：「該項自動機之裝置完成之後、該公司得與工部局商訂價目表、俾公司能於投資上、能得純年息百分之八又百分之二云、」</p>
<p>第一節、—乙、關於本問題、各專家首稱、彼等在擬具報告書時所時時懷念者、即所謂最良狀態（Optimum　Condition者、係指在某種供應者、應認為合理之代價、而能給與勝任餘款之服務而言者、關乎機件方面、報告書中有如下之記載、「上海所有之機件、在各方面觀之、均屬近代、能作最優等之電話供應、在事實上亦巳如此、吾人亦曾調閱公司之記錄、其中對於供應方面、表示不滿者極少、公司方面之服務考騐及阻礙報告、亦足表示該公司供應之優良、用戶方面之經諮詢者、亦稱現有電話之優越、勝前此一九三零年華洋德律風公司所供給者萬倍、」該項服務之效能及普遍、在營業擴充之突飛猛進方面、亦可見其一斑、報告書中、曾有詳細之記述、各專家復謂、「該公司之全部機卅、係為目前及預計日後上海本埠之情狀而計劃者、他日業務發達擴充之時、新資之投入、所需亦極有限、若以購置或建造該項機卅全部當時之情形而論、該公司之支出、在吾人觀之、亦皆合理必需、且係由審愼出之者、蓋時公衆對於較良之電話供應、需求甚殷、而機械之裝置、復不得不力求完備、以合當地之需要且依特許合同之規定、在嚴厲處分之下、公司須於二年之內、完成自動機之更改、而公司竟能於二十個月中、完成該項規定、較特許合同中所允許者、减少一百三十二日、此種辦事迅速之精神、於用戶方面、確有極大之價值、</p>
<p>再以支出而言、在一九三五年七月三十日、該公司機件產業之總投資、達四二·二九四·〇〇〇元、但至本年年終、可望增至四二·八三〇·〇〇〇元之譜、電話公司在「營利資本「（CapitalInvestear即特許合同上所規定之營業投資）上、應可取得純利百分之八又百分之二、此項營利資本、在一九三四年年終、係三四·八三六·〇〇〇元、此外復有其他投資、約六·〇〇〇·〇〇〇以上、不得享受同一之純利、此項區別、即因公司總投資之中、有數種公司經營利之權之銀錢投入、如折舊之滾存、及一九三三年因財政調度而得之盈餘等是也、</p>
<p>報告書中　稱、「一九三四年十二月三十一日至一九三五年七月三十一日之間、公司之　投資、雖巳增加一·三四六·〇〇〇元、但同時因攤還債欵之故、營利資本實已减少六九〇·〇〇〇元、由此可知該公司之總投資、在本年前七月之中、雖巳增至四二·二九四·〇〇〇元、而營利資本、反自三四·八三六·〇〇〇元、减至三四·一四六·〇〇〇元也、有謂公司之機件、有逾分增築之嫌、而支出方面亦有浪費之過、惟據吾人謂查之所得、則覺不盡如此、反之、此種支出、在當時形勢之下、實旣屬合理復係必需也、再則公司在更換自動機期內、約二年之中、支出總額、達一七·七三五·〇〇〇兩之鉅、超出安生報告書中所估計者、一倍有餘、此或亦支出浪費說之由來、蓋據安生氏之所估計、所需祗八·〇〇〇·〇〇〇兩也、」</p>
<p>關於上文所言、各專家復有如下之詳細說明、當安生氏草具估計之時、華洋德律風公司、猶矗然存在、彼時亦無組織新公司之擬議、但當新公司特許合同擬定之時、新供應所應具之種種要件、已詳細訂定、當時之見解、似有「取精用宏、一勞永逸、」勢、舊制度旣經推翻、而未來日增月進之需要、復不得不加以準備、此即現在公司實支出與安生報告書中所估計者、不能符合之最大原因、嗣後金價暴漲、兩值慘跌、影響公司建築費用百分之八五、公司支出、遂以益鉅矣、據專家調查之所得、在安生草具報告之時、每規元百兩合美金六十一元八角三分九厘、但在新公司建設稈序之中、規元百兩之平均價格、祇及美金三十三元一角一分四厘、至一九三〇年七月三十一日、亦不過每規則百兩、合美金三十七元之譜、</p>
<p>各專家復稱、在一九三四年年終、公司對於機件及營業等等投資之總數、為四〇·九四八·一二五元、內分現在應用之中、由舊公司轉讓之機械、估值為一一·五八〇·〇〇〇元、及自一九三〇年八月五日以後、新公司所裝置之機件、估值為二九·三六八·〇〇〇元、各專家曾就公司產業種類之大宗、討論其是否經濟、先就外綫裝置而論、各專家覺其支出極為合理、並謂、一公司方面、實根據健全之工程知識及經濟的應用、一切投資、均屬合即審愼、故外綫機件、自各方面觀之、均屬近代而優良一云、至於話具設備、據各專家所見、亦極公道、其由舊式話具、在短促時期之中、一律改為自動機、尤屬難能可貴、「以如此廣闊之範圍、如此短促之期限、能一律更新、在他處恐不多觀云、</p>
<p>次論通話次數、在設備上之影響、各專家預示、在將來採用任何種限量制度之後、通話次數或將有大量的减少、在彼時、「公司方面當可將新設備之投資支出、在現在情况下所不可避免者、暫緩支付、而在某某等分站、多餘之通電器、亦可暫為存貯、以備日後擴充時之中、此種通電器設備緩川之效果、即屬每綫設備費用之相等節省、由於同一理由、每綫之維持費用、亦必因之而有相當之低减」云、</p>
<p>關乎土地房產等、公司方面所指示之數目、查與一九三〇年八月當時之地價相符、而房屋所佔之價目、亦屬公平合理、而工作設備之總數、在同等範圍之公司之中、可云極低、第一節、內、各專家稱、彼等對於公司之各分站、均經親往視察、以覘機件之維持、有何管理之方、此種視察之結果、使各專家認為各站所採用採用之方法、係屬最新式者、與美國之貝爾系電話公司、及英國之郵政局所採用者相同、證請世界各大電話事業管理之方法、則本埠電話公司維持之成績、堪稱滿意、而用戶困難之數目記載、亦無可訾之處、若以各站內部困難而論、數目大概均在平衡之下、僅中央一站、則以通話次數過高之故、數字蛟他處為大、但困難排除之工作、尙能保持極高之標準、該報告書復稱、「維持費用、祇佔營業支出全額之一部份、蓋營業支出項下尙有下列之各種費用、均係由上海電話公司支付者、（一）普通、（二）通話、（三）業務、（四）維持、（五）折舊、（六）稅捐、吾人深覺營業支出、確有從長計議之必要、曾以上述前四項、與他處各電話事業相路、但又以各處情形各異、甚或不得相提并論、故比擬之中、亦應出以極端之審愼、惟以薄記法而言、則美國諸公司、與上海電話公司所有者大致相同、而東方諸國電話組織、因人民生活程度類似之故、亦多可資引證之處、美國貝爾系各公司之簿記中、將長途電話之費用、與當地費用合置、無從加以分析、此外檀香山Mutnal　Telephone　Company因其營業狀况、與上海電話公司所有者、極相類似、可資比較、惟檀查山公司所有營業費用中、普通及業務二項費用極低、較上海公司相去甚遠、由此可見上海公司之費用、似有更求緊縮之可能也、即如上海電話公司、在本年前半年中、在每具話機上所耗去之廣告及兜銷費用、竟達二元一角四分之鉅、吾人雖知社會經濟之凋敝、不得不藉廣告宣傳、以為吸引之用、但得失相較、是否相應、尤宜出之以愼重也、再以他一方面觀之、每具話機所耗成本之總額、最高者莫如美陶各公司、而東方各公司則屬至低、此實由於東西人民生活程度高下懸殊之故、但上海電話公司、每具話機費用、平均總額、在去歲除去管理費用之後、尙達四十六元二角之譜、實為中日二國相近各城電話事業中之最高者、再則上海電話公司職員之中、俸給極優之外籍人員、為數至鉅、該公司雖屬外資經營、最高位置不得不由外人任之、但在高級職員之下、無關事權之位置尙多、而就地汲引同等人材、旣屬公司自白之政策、則在此後、受有相當訓練及具有技術專長之人員、可以當地聘用之時、公司方面、即應儘量厲行該項政策也、」</p>
<p>再則各專家對於電話公司所採用之折舊計算法、即公司產業總額、每年折去百分之四。五、認為尙屬可算、並建議在此後經騐方面、未有其他指示之前、應繼續照此計算云、</p>
<p>第二節、甲·據各專家所稱、現在普遍應用電話收費制度、約分三種、即按具收費、（或無限制通話辦法）階段計數、及按次收費是也、各專家對於上述三種辦法之利弊、各有詳盡之討論、惟認按具收費一法、祇宜於較小之電話統系、至如上海幅員之廣闊、人口之衆多、服務之週到與否、端賴分站之普遍敷設、而按具收費制、遂不復相宜矣、復據各專家所言、一夫無限制供應之普遍價目、係以大小用戶全體之平均應用為根據、此項價目普遍平均之結果、即小用戶之裹足不前、及大用戶之儘量應用、但大用戶儘量濫用之弊、不僅損害自已電話之功用、而其他用戶之欲與通話者、亦同時感覺其阻礙、所謂「忙綫」者、因其忙也、故外來之電話、每不能接通、與之通話者、因屢呌不應之故、視為「等於關門」、或數呌不應之後、不得不轉呌他家、於是話綫常忙之商家、無形之中、即失却許多主顧、但電話屢呌不通、亦有相當損失、其費用實均攤於大小用戶之全體用戶之大衆、遂普遍蒙其損失、」</p>
<p>上海一埠、因採用無限制通話按具收費辦法之結果、造成一切弊端、專家報告書中、均經一一指出、並稱、除用戶之中、有漫不經心、任意濫用者外、復有裝置住宅電話、而作營業之用者、在公司方面、提出證據頗多云、各專家稱、「鑒於本埠商家普遍敷設之狀况、若僅將商用電話之按其收費制取銷、亦屬無補於事、因如此變易之後、凡原在商家電話發出之通話、儘可在按具收費之住宅電話中行之、再如由用戶自由選擇收費之辦法、亦屬無益、且經他處屢次試用之結果、大用戶將繼續採用無限制按具收費制、而小川戶則採取限制數目、或按次付費辦法、因大小用戶各採擇具於已有利之辦法也、」各專家復稱、因電話之供應、得以任意濫用之故、自一九三零年至一九三四年之間、用戶通話次數、前後增加一倍之鉅、而公司之資本及營業費用、遂亦因之而激增、「凡此一切額外之費用、其因通話次數之非常高額所造成者、勢須由各用戶、不計其大小、平均擔負之、故此種普遍一律之收費辦法、若長此不予變更、則對於小用戶之不利、亦將與日而俱增、今為補救之計、吾人深覺除採用一種收費之新制、使所付供應之代價、與所享之實用、發生若干關係外、更無良策、」</p>
<p>各專家復謂、「階段計數之辦法、或可用為自按具收費制改為按次收費制之間之一種過渡辦法、但階段計數辦法、亦有其缺點、往往因通話多寡數次之故、而造成話價上下數元之別、故此制絕不足取、而極少採用者、因此吾人所得之結論、即為按次收費制、其中含有基本階段通話次數在內者、誠屬最適宜之辦法、上海一切用戶、不論其為商家或住宅、均應一律採用之「吾等之主張、即上海之用戶、不論其為商家或住宅、應一律採用以供應之代價為根據之按次收費辦</p>

<p>法、因吾人深信、此種辦法、為最有利於社會」云第二節、乙·關乎規定價目、俾上海電話公司得於營利投資上享受純利百分之八又百分之二一事、各專家在未决定之前、曾考慮其他數事項、第一點、關於採用任何種按次收費辦法之後、通話次數上之影響、電話公司、巳同意於百分之三七·五之减縮、各專家對於此點、認為合理、因此彼等之結論、為採用按次收費制、而將第一階段之通話次數、歸納於某本話費之內、幷將額外每次通話之取資减低、即屬最合乎目前實用之辦法、各專家於是進而計算必須之價目、使在按次收費辦法上、得產生應得之利益、幷尋得其利息之白分數、但保留不論之一項、關於美國政府所得稅、總公司管理費、及每年折舊十五萬元者、均不在計算之內、此等費用、倘日後得由公司於營業項下支出、則純利上將有百分之二相近之低减、照此計算、各專家所認為必需者、即商用電話每月通話、以一百五十次為基本階段、定價為每月十一元、家用電話、每月以一百次為基本階段、定價每月七元、此外不論商用家用、每多用一次、收費三分、但各專家、深覺上海電話公司應願接受較此稍低之項目、庶日後經濟凋敝情形稍見緩和、或竟今部消滅、公司所獲贏利、不致超出其所應得者、而致必須再付調查、以求公司收入之再低减、各專家於是復另擬一價目表、該項價目表、在開始施行之中、可得純利百分之八·五四、深盼公司方面、能暫時接受該項辦法、即商用電話每月十元、可通話一百五十次、額外每次三分、分綫每月五元、家用電話、每月六元五角、可通話一百次、額外每次三分、是也、此外甩在巳經施用按次收費辦法之電話、此後將與其他商用電話、一律計算、即每月十元、得通話一百五十次是也、</p>
<p>報告得復稱、「當草擬價目表時、曾須擬通話次數、將低减百分之三七·五、但如低减之數、超過此項預計、則公司之贏利、亦必不能得預期之數、但以各種情形觀之、吾人深覺無法可以獲得較此更為相近之計算、吾人亦嘗以他地電話事業之自按具收費辦法、變更按次收費辦法者、其所得之經騐為借鏡、吾等復深知現在通話次數、為額極高、將來施行新制之後、通話次數之低落、自必較原有通話額低下者為甚也、再則極為明顯者、即小用戶在現在擬具之價目表中所付之話費、將較彼等現在付給者為低、據吾等之記載、若以本年四月一日以前之電話價目計之、則住宅用戶中將有白分之四十七、商用電話中將有白分之四十一、此後將付較低之話費、若更以現行暫時加價之數目計之、則此後住宅用戶中將有百分之五十九、商川電話中將有百分之五十、話費將可節省、由此而觀、可見按次收費制、實行之後、並不如外間所傳、話費將有普遍之增加也、」</p>
<p>至於價目表中其他各項、各專家亦擬加以修改、其修改之價目有如下之諸項、</p>
<p>棹機每具每月加收、原定一元四角七分現定五角、裝置費、原定十三元九角九分、現定十元正、分線及屋內分機、原定二元一角九分、現一律一元、重接費、原定二元八角、現定二元、</p>
<p>以上諸項、均較原定價格為低、此外復有</p>
<p>自川專線·揷線·分線·等、原定以路綫計算、規定每半空哩、或不及半空哩、每綫十二元、超過半空哩、每加十分一哩、或其零數、加價一元、話機每具一元、</p>
<p>私用接綫盤、每月租費、原定十線一元六角三分、十五綫三元五角、二十五綫七元三角、三十六綫九元四角九分、四十七綫十元九角三分、五十八綫十二元四角、現定租費、十綫五元、十五綫七元、二十五綫十元、三十六綫十二元、四十七綫十四元、五十八綫十六元、</p>
<p>以上專綫價目、羅之本年一月電話公司所擬之價目、已大見低減、凡租用私綫者、旣可得一直接敏捷之私人通話、而電話公司方面、除租費之外、并無別項收入、否則倘專綫不存在時、用戶通話、勢須經過公司之分站、如是非多裝一綫有適當之收入、故在規定此項專綫價目之時、租戶所得之供應、亦不得不計及也、至私用接綫盤租費、路前已略見增、加但公司方面、在此項下、損失極大、此些徴之增加、可稍減公司之損失、再則棹機加價、減低幾三分之二、分綫分機、減</p>
<p>云二分之一以上、然則此種接綫盤租費之增加、誠不足慮也、」</p>
<p>報告書末稱、「上列各項價目、吾等深盼上海電話公司、能接受之、將來贏利不足之時、尚可按特許合同十四條、重新提出　論、」云、</p>
<p>以上為電話專家對於職權範圍以內調查諸事項全部答案之槪要、此外復有數種重要問題、與本埠電話事業有密切之關係、便不在調查範圍之內者、各專家復有下述各種意見發表、</p>
<p>各專家之言日、此外復有不在吾人調查範圍以內之數種事項、吾人以各方面屬望之殷、謹發表意見如下、</p>
<p>通話費問顥、此為上海電話公司與中國電話局兩種用戶間、通話費用之煩惱問題、吾人對於兩個當局所辦之電話系統、其間用戶可以自由通話而不須付費者、誠無前例可援、但在現有辦法之下、一系統中之用戶、在通話銜接之前、為紀錄起見、而必須自報其號碼、因此而發生之種種弊病及詐欺濫用、又復彰彰在人耳目、用戶往往並未通話、而須代人付通話之話費、極屬不公、此種弊病、倘直接搖號、能行於二系統之間、即可免去、</p>
<p>長途電話接線問題——、中國之長途電話、係中國政府所經營、凡相界用戶、欲呌長途電話之時、其通話先須接至電話公司中央站之人工接綫機、由該處接綫生詢明原呌者電話號碼、及所需接通之電話叼數、該接綫生將雙方號碼錄下之後、冉搖至閘北長途電話處、該處復由中國電話局接線生、照樣詢明方雙電話號碼、鍛後再接通、此種手續極為繁重而重複、倘當地及長電話、係隸屬於同一當局者、僅一站即可、原無兩站之需要、即在技術上觀之、多設一站、本屬節外生枝、且因多此一站之故、長途通話時、聲音已大為减低、而機件及工作上、亦多阻碍貽誤之處、時間方面、亦極不經濟、故此多餘之站、不啻車具五輪、反感不便也、</p>
<p>中國當局、在公共租界之內、毫無長途電話站之分設、北明顯之理由、即為租界營業特許權、旣已頒給上海電話公司、電話局方面、若目在租界設立分站、恐與公司主權有關、但在另一方面、上海電話公司、為服務及稽核起見、不許其用戶直接與電話局接綫線話、而同公司人員記錄通話之次數、故遇有困難之時、對用戶負資者、非中國電話局、而為上海電話公司、由此以觀、可見此種不相宜之辦法、雙方設站辦理長途通話，若公司與話局各不相讓、則將長繼續存在、更出技術上觀之、長途電話之話綫、為廠為與用戶力求接近、此即中國電話局之話綫、數以上海電話公司之長途電話接綫盤為終果是也、如此種辦法、不能成立則以吾人所見、最適宜之方法、即應准許租界用戶、直接與閘北長途電話站通話呌接、而電話公司方面、儘可派遣會計人員駐站、記錄話數、以昭信實、此二種辦法、任擇其一、均可節省費用、並使通話時聲音淸晰、因接綫點、巳减去其一故也、故吾等主張、雙方電話當局、應將此事、深加考慮、設法成立諒解、而求免去現有之不良辦法、</p>
<p>「界外築路電話問題、現現在界外築路區內電話用戶所付之代價、其影響似足使電話事業之發展、僅限於不得不裝電話之居民、此種狀况、當然其咎不在上海電話公司、因該公司所收之話費、與租界用戶相等、至於徵收附加費用、公司方面、非但無利可圖、且須代收代付、手續繁重、怨尤叢集、即以北區而論、該地中國電話局、本可供給電話、而必須由電話公司代徵附加費用、作為中國電話局放棄電話權利之租稅、而中國電話局、旣准用戶裝置租界電話、用戶方面、遂可節省每次五分之通話貨矣、現在此問題、猶在中外雙方交涉之中、故目前對於此項繁複之問題、不官加以詳盡之計議、但吾人所欲言者、界外築路區內人民、對於負擔之繁重、頗聞嘖有煩言也、</p>

<p>中央社云、本埠蒲石路五三四號中國公用黃汽車公司、原係美商創辦、十七年由華商接辦、現有新舊轎車百輛專營出租營業、年來以同業競爭頗烈、從跌價招徠後、營業雖盛、而入不敷出、返以亞細亞汽油厰欠欵糾紛、致信譽大損、昨以週轉不靈、經董事會議決非停業、并召盤承辦、司機及職工欠薪及保證金、經負責人商洽後、今日可有辦法、聞其負債的為五萬元、正委由律師會計師依法清算、茲將各情誌後、</p>
<p>創辦歷史</p>
<p>公用黃汽車公司創設已有多年、初係美商經營、因營業不振、宣告停業、由美國法庭公告拍賣、經華商以十一萬零三百元之標價接辦、收足固定資本十萬元、流動資本五萬元、當設總公司於法租界蒲石路、并先後增設分站於全市各通衢、計十一處、現已新轎車約百輛、全身髹黃色、頗為注目、而在兩年前、因油價低廉、營業甚佳、</p>
<p>拮据情形</p>
<p>年來經營出租汽車事業者、風涌雲起、乃羣相跌價、以廣招徠、惟以油　漸漲、捐稅負擔亦重、致多有收入不敷支出之勢、該公司雖能維持、但早無贏利可言、致股息未發已久、兩月前又以積欠油欵約一萬元、被亞細亞公司控訴於第二特區法院、後雖經以「前欠綏付以後現購」之條件和解了事、惟在信譽上頗受損失、致賖購油料之路告絕、而車賬又不易按期收齊、漸現拮据之狀、</p>
<p>決議停業</p>
<p>當時該公司曾以情勢困難、召集股東大會商議、當經議決、授權董事會辦理、如迫不得已、則行停業、最近因同業競爭頗烈、當跌價每二十分鍾僅收大洋八角、致入不敷出、公司職工薪金、積欠一月未發、前日以流動資金枯竭、午後、即未營業、當夜經董事會議決停業、委由郭澈明律師·沈家楨會計師·代表、依法清算</p>
<p>宣告清算</p>
<p>昨晨總公司門首貼出郭澈明律師沈家楨會計師代表中國公用黃汽車股份有限公司宣告清算、并召盤公告云、據上開公司董事會聲稱、本公司、因受市面不景氣影響、現金無法週轉、業經股東會議決停業清算、委託貴會會計師貴律師為清算人、請辦理清算事宜等語、據此、除受委辦理并呈報外、務希該公司各債權人、於十五日內、携帶債權憑證、至本會計事務所登記、以憑彙核、各債務人亦希於十五日內、將所欠欵項、送交本會計師事務所核收、掣取收據、逾期當依法訴追、再該公司、如有人　意承盤者、請至本會計者事務所接洽、特此公告、二十四年十月二十三日、</p>
<p>職工索薪</p>
<p>公司職工約三百人、上月薪金未發、而司機員并每人繳有保證金五十元、昨見公司停業、即起恐慌、羣向交涉、當由現任經理張勗唐勸解、靜候清算、一面由法捕房派警趕到駐守、幸未肇事、午後、由職工派代表十人、與沈會計師郭律師暨公司負責人、在法捕房內會談、未有結果、聞今日將繼續會商、當可有解決辦法、職工方面、并已呈請市司機業公會、及市黨政機關核辦、</p>

<p>大會四項會程</p>
<p>大會會程業經執行委員會决定、主要者四項、（一）秘書長、會計及文書等課之工作報告、（二）商討敎育部請該會補助義務敎育經費十五萬元、應如何處理案、（三）討論調查全國中等學校問題該項工作如何進行、抑或暫綏辦理、（四）該會辦事細則、係於民國九年該會成立時所擬、頗為陳舊、與目前情形、不甚適用、該會為頓飭內部工作起見、此次大會决提倡討論如何市新擬定辦事細則案、</p>
<p>義務敎費問題</p>
<p>義務敎育經費補助問題為此次大會討論案中之最難解决者、原敎育部為推進並普遍余國義務敎育、曾召開各庚欵機關聯席會議、議定請該會補助四十萬元、但該會本年四月間舉行年會時、對此事提出討論、結果、該會因年來經濟不景氣、會中經濟、巳感不敷分配、無力再籌此鉅欵、遂予否决、嗣後敎育部將數目、减至十五萬元、仍請該會補助該會以義不容辭、擬由近兩年來節省積畜之滙兌費中撥付、但亦僅能籌至七八萬元、與預定額尙差一半、故此次大會將提出此項問題討論、</p>
<p>孟祿博士提案</p>
<p>國際敎育研究會會長、美國哥倫比亞大學敎育學院院長、兼中華教育文化基金會董事孟祿博士、本年來華時、鑒於中國近十年來中等敎育突飛猛進、但因地域之不同、程度亦皆參差不齊、敎育部又缺乏調查、全國中等敎育調查、敎部僅調查至民國十九年、茲為得有詳確之調查、進行改善起見、孟祿博士提議擬由中華敎育文化基金會進行此種工作、並可由美國聘請著名敎育家來華、義務帮忙、該會亦以此事頗為重要、惟進行非易、須聘請專門人材多名、始可從事調奄預計一年餘、可望完成、需費四五萬元、故將討論在經濟不敷分配之現在該會情形之下、如何進行、抑或停辦云（，）</p>

<p>現在我國規定的初中敎學時數前三學期每週三十六小時、第四學期一二十五小時、第五學期三十六小時、第六學期三十五小時、（各時數內均包含有童軍訓練）、高中敎學時數前三學期每週三十四小時、第四學期三十三小時、第五六學期各三十一小時、這樣的規定縱的方面、並沒有超過我國歷來規定的時數、橫的方面、比了法意兩國底中學稍多一點、比了蘇俄又較少一點、大致和英德兩國差不多、至於初中學生每日上評及自習總時數規定為八小時、每週合計四十八小時、高中學生每日上課自習及課外運動總時數規定為十小時、每週合計六十小時、這種規定雖然無可比擬、但也並非不合理、第一、初中學生年齡較幼、身心發育上所需要的休息較多、所以酌採勞工上三八制底精神、定為每週作業四十八小時、除敎學三十五六小時外、可得自習十二三小時、其分配約為一與三之比、在敎學時間內、有些科目需要自習較多、而有些科目無須自習或自習可以較少、截長補短、大致也不差什麽、至於課外運動及活動雖不包括在校自習時間內、但牠底性質是輕鬆的活動、正好調劑嚴重的作業、時間多少可以由學校酌量支配和邇用了、第二、各國中學高年級底敎學時數都比低年級底敎學時數為多、我國現制高中敎學時數反比初中敎學時數少、高中高年級敎學時數又比低年級敎學時數為少、並非違反一般的超勢、却是因為高中學科底內容較為深速而繁複、學生自動研究底能力也較强、所以各科應配以較多的自習時間、敎學時數雖較少、而每日作業底總時數則由八小增時為十小時了、</p>
<p>其實學習擔負底輕重絕對不能簡單地拿教學時數底多寡來說明、和學習擔負有關係的因素太多了、第一、是敎材問題、同是一小時的某科目底敎學、敎材內容可以很簡單、無須多少課前的預習、課後的複習、也可以很繁複、而需要成倍的時間雲端學習、每一科止底敎材應依照該科目全部敎學時數并侉計可能有的自習時數和斟酌學生程度適當地規定、不要有深淺失度和不够教或教不完的弊病、每一敎學時間的教材也要分配合適、不要有詳略失當或輕車不勻的情形、這種教材底支配是課程標準首先應該做到的、現行中學課稈標準各科敎材大綱、不免詳略不一、有較為具體而恰當的、有異常空洞而難以依據的、亟須加以檢討、有人說如再要詳細規定、那就是敎村細止了、不管大綱也好、細止也好、各科敎材實質和分量總還要細寗地研究、加以明確的規定或補充、使學習上、各時間單位底分量有正確的依據、第二、是敎本問題怎樣拿敎村大網演繹而為具體敎材、表達於學生面前、使他易於了解和學習是敎本編製底功夫、怎樣審查教本以擇優汰劣使不良的敎本絕跡於學校是審定敎科圖書底工作、這兩層是國家和社會應當為靑年學習担負打算好的、第三、是敎具問題、實騐室·圖書館·工塲和一切敎學上器村底設備、無疑的都和學習作用關係密切、要增進敎學底效率、减輕學習底担負、敎學設備是絕對不可忽視的、第四、是敎育問題、敎材·敎本·敎具都是靜的、敎員是動的、沒有敎員去運用、一切都是外的、有了敎昌策勤、一切都活了、並且良好的敎員還可以彌縫種種缺陷、發揮敎學上至高的效率、减輕學習底擔負、第五、是學校一般管訓底情形、僩良好的學校生活處處都能鼓舞學習底興趣和促進事習底努力、每個靑年底個性都為敎職員所熟察、每個靑年底整個生活都敎職員所注意、個別的困難有所救正、身心底疲勞有所調節、學習過程可以順道地進展、那里還覺得有什麼擔負不了的情形呢、</p>
<p>以上所講敎材、教本敎具、敎員和一般管訓情形都是學習擔負底基本因素、要想减輕現時中學生底學習担負、應綜合這五方面詳細研究、然後才可得一解答、不然、單單着目於尚無不合的現制中學底敎學時數、要想加以核減、姑無論縱減也减不到什麽特殊地步、即使大减而特减、减成七折八扣的樣子、而其他關係學習的基本因素依然如故、我相信、我確信中學生底學習担負是不會怎樣减輕的、我們自然不能以抱殘守闕的態度無倏件地來擁護現行的敎育制度、祝牠萬歲萬萬歲、但我們討論一個問題、應該握住問題底核心、不應為皮相之論、如果我們僅從敎學時數來討論中學生底學習担負、實在是不揣其本而齊其末、如果再依據膚淺的觀察和錯誤的事實來批評現行中學敎學時數的制度、那史是痴人說夢、（完）</p>

<p>— 美國奧爾珂德女士原著鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>從沒有忘記了他的老朋友的小坦第，一聽到那個名字，便從他父親懷裏掙了脫來，以輕捷的步履帶跳走跑到門口，看着那滿曬陽光平舖細草的廣塲，臉上殊有一種切望的神色，又帶跳帶走地跑了回來，又照舊刁嘴地說道：（因為他每次佇盼而失望後總是這麽說的）</p>
<p>「我的唐納開要來老。」（註）</p>
<p>「我真的想我們應該是要留他在這兒的，即使單是為了坦第的緣故，他是那麽喜歡他的，也許孩子的感情可以做到我們所沒有能做到的事。」</p>
<p>「我有時也有那種感想：不過旣然把孩子們鬧得個不亦樂乎，又差不多將全家燒了，我我想為安全計，只得去掉了那個火星，至少應得暫時將他送開一陣子的。」裴先生說道。</p>
<p>「午餐巳預備好了，讓我來搖鈴，」羅勃說了，便在那件「樂器」上來一個獨奏，獲得這麽利害，簡直連自已的談話也聽不見了。</p>
<p>「十個南恩也可以，只要你要的話，我的親愛的，直可以容留全世界沒人照管一切頑皮的孩子。</p>

<p>南開大學校長張伯苓先生，是全國敎育界體育界的泰斗。一天在國際大飯店國貨工廠歡迎全運會女選手席上，說了一段提倡國貨的絕妙詞令，博得全場掌聲不絕，都說這「高幹子的張老先生」，的確有眼光，有見解，肯實心實力，替國貨努力的。張先生說，一樣的貨物，何以我們不及人家，我們只有慚愧，只有勉勵，使我們的貨品勝過人家。一樣貨物的價目，何以人家比我們便宜！我們只有慚愧，只有發奮，使我們貨物的價格，比人家便宜。須知愛國的話。在目前文化未發達的中國，不是普遍可以推行的。愛精美，貪便宜，是人們的本性，决不是僅憑口頭提倡，可以變換過來的。要不許人家買便宜貨，購精美品，眞是談何容易？像我目下的衣着，都是用過調查工夫的，因為西裝褲子，一時買不到國貨呢料，吾便做了綢緞的料子，覺得也還不錯。這全在大家肯抱些犧牲精神，卜些决心罷了。最是痛心的，西文中國的名詞，是從出產瓷器得來，可是目下西菜館的益碟都不是中國貨了。諸位翻開盆子來看看，這是不是中國貨？大菜桌上的檯毯，是不是中國貨？杯裏的紅茶牛乳，是不是中國貨？一方的紙頭，是不是中國貨？這不是吾來殺風景，也不是來責備飯店主人，這是我們公共的羞恥，以數千年來出產瓷器的國家，還用不到大菜盆子，這是誰的罪過，誰的責任？諸位旣知提倡國貨和鍜鍊體格，同是複興民族的途徑，諸位都有責任，諸位如果從今以後，努力服用國貨，製造國貨，或者我們下次出席歡迎會時，可以見不到一件外國貨，這才不負吾今天的一席話。張老先生眞誠懇切，大家都為動容，認為這量是澈底最有肝膽的說話。吾很希望大家把他來咀嚼一下，反省一下，比較空喊空鬧的辦法，倒有些效力呢。</p>
<h3 id="c149">海關入超額中「米」占首位的警報 <a href="#c149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>衣·食·住·行·為民生的四大要素！古時「民以食為天的昭示，大家想早耳熟能詳了，以占有全國人口總額中百分之八十以上的農民，而食的問題，還不能自給自足，仰人鼻息！眞是異常痛心一件事！</p>
<p>在提倡國貨熱烈聲裏，我們讀到國際貿易局呈實業部報告的本年上半期，國際貿易狀况是怎樣使人傷戚的是「半年來洋貨進口情形，總值計二億八千八百七十三萬六千餘金單位，以金價低落之關係，故就國幣計算，雖較去年同期减少，但就金單位計算，則尙增加百分之七，其中進口價值最鉅者為—米—共一一，一八六，九六〇公擔，值四三，三五九，〇〇〇餘金單位」結語為「我國進口商品，向為棉花·五金·米·煤油·小麥·絕少變動，本年上半期中，除媒油低降外，米·棉·五金·小麥四項，仍屬進口之四大台柱，在工業未能發達的我國，五金進口，固不足奇，而農產品輸入若是之巨，實為我對外貿易之最大危機」云云。</p>
<p>吾們看到上述「米」進口的數字，和他的結語，眞是悚然驚懼了！</p>
<p>英·意對立，劍拔弩張，日形尖親化！世界二次大戰！迫在眉睫！而回顧我們的國防情形怎樣？國民經濟狀况怎樣？農業生產如何？則我敢大聲疾呼曰，束手待斃而已！不是嗎？國防方面毫無險要壁壘，毫無現代軍事設備！至國民經濟，則水災遍地，災民成千成萬，農業生產，則田地漂沒！米稻豐收之區，又突現白蛸蟲害，全功盡棄！設無外米接濟，勢必盡成餓莩！然而此種痛心現象！苟吾們口岸一旦因世界大戰而被人封鎖—則釜魚之勢巳成，不亡何待？</p>
<p>所以「米」的問題，應速在農業上未雨綢繆，於豐收之區，趕緊防備害蟲，於漂沒田地，則火速溝洩水利，反荒為熟！栽培國米，提倡國米，實為提倡國貨中萬急不容緩之一事也！企予望之！汪瘦秋</p>

<h3 id="c151">稻草製漿之漂白法（上） <a href="#c151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— 天虛我生</p>
<p>承民豐造紙廠金潤庠竺梅先二君過訪，以稻草製報紙之成本見詢，茲記其概要如次。</p>
<p>竺君述其經過，初用固體苛性鈉百分之十三，蒸解稻草，每一球容八十担，需十二小時，嗣改用石灰百分之十煮四小時，取出洗滌，再行入球，用液體苛性鈉百分之十三，煮四小時後，打漿漂白以至成品，每百斤紙料成本，核五元九角，卽每噸核百元之譜，每磅核四分半，以普通報紙，每令三十七磅計之，料本巳核一元七角之譜，加以漉紙工程，巳不能與舶來品同樣之廉，如不漂白，則每噸草漿，用草四十担，以石灰煮化，漂去黃水成漿，原不過二十四元可矣，故此難題，實在於漂白方面云云，予因就予所經騐者略述如左。。</p>
<p>稻草製漿，實際不止以三作一，就城市購草而論，每一千斤作三元計，應用硫化鈉十磅，約六角，初成絨料以四百斤論，應用亞硫酸鈉三十磅，約三元九角，鹽酸八磅，約四角八分，如上併計，每以五倍作一頓計，不過三十九元九角，應用煤電實除不過六元七角五分，是其成本，至多不過五十元耳，每磅作二分半計，普通報紙每令三十七磅，用料不及一元，加以漉紙工程雙班開足，至多亦不過一元，每令若賺二角，亦可觀矣，惟其手續，當分三步，由草成絨，用硫化鑛與石灰並不加昂，惟用石灰者需時頗久，如在鄉間操作，則殊不成問題，若在廠中，則光陰可貴，尺地寸金，自以速成為經濟，用硫化鈉者，其目的卽以澱粉質化為糖液，容易分解？不致成糊，故蒸三小時即可出球，配合之量，雖如上述，以斤配磅，適佔千分之十，但於稀釋之量，則於成品頗有關係，若過濃强，則沾着較多之草，必致腐爛，是宜先用適量之水化開，以能使草莖潤濕為宜。</p>
<p>如上述，第一步之成品，實際不止百分之四十，每百斤草出球，若僅漂去黃水，令其乾燥，總得六十斤以上，但經打漿機叩解成漿，施行漂白工程之後，則成品大為减折，不過能得四十斤耳，若其工作不愼，則損失之量，殊不可以概論，例如蒸解過度，則成糊者多，在叩解及漂洗時，必從網目逸去，故其成品，以五倍作為一噸，其實，每四千斤草成一噸漿，已屬最低限度，今以二千斤漿，漂成一噸，不啻又含八折，只在操作者之技能嫻熟，决不致有大出入也，任何工作，决不能單靠文字，蓋文字不過如醫方用藥，僅示一標準而已，譬如炊飯，但開示其方式，用若干米，加若干水。煮若干時，而結果往往失敗，或煮成粥，或成焦飯，正不一致，是以漂白工稈，决非鄉農所能勝任，當由廠家為之。</p>
<p>亞硫酸鈉不止一種，宜用「酸性亞硫酸鈉」亦稱「重亞硫酸鈉」其方程式為Na2HSO3普通所售之亞硫酸鈉，並非酸性，其方程式為NaSO3不適於用，漂白之功效，適與用「酸鹽化鈣」漂白者相反，蓋亞硫酸之作用，為奪取物質中之酸素而成脫色，酸鹽化鈣之作用，則以放出酸素，而使物質酸化以致脫色，故其成品相等而功效實有不同，因其成本羅廉，故造報紙用者，只需亞硫酸漂，不必用酸鹽素漂。但其鑨匯，卽在日久吸收空氣中之養氣，易變黃耳，是故舶來品之報紙，日久無不變黃，硫化木漿之短處在此，而其長處，卽在成本較廉，如用酸鹽素漂，則其用量須加一倍，改鹽酸為硫酸，亦倍其量，所需時間亦倍之，故其成本加重，用於報紙卽不合算。</p>
<h3 id="c152">值得提倡的稭製人造絲 <a href="#c152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— 昭</p>
<p>驟見吾題者，必謂子何懵然？而誤舶來人造絲為國貨耶？落筆何不思之甚！記者曰，舶來者，資吾借鏡也，猶今之汽車，輪舶之交通利器，何莫非脫胎於吾黃帝始瓶之舟車乎？今有國產高粱楷製之人造絲發明！安得而不喜？深切熱望有志者事竟成的酆雲鶴女士！</p>
<p>靑島通訊，有酆雲鶴女士者，係魯之利津人，畢業於國立北平女子師範大學，於民國十五年，經山東省敎育廳派往美國留學，入俄亥俄大學攻工業化學，於一九三三年畢業，獲博士學位，繼赴德國研究印染，因痛心中國入口人造絲數額價值之鉅，亟欲有以挽回此項利樺，乃努力研究，欲利用中國生產多而價值低之植物，以製造人造絲，今春卽以試騐高粱稭製人造絲而成功，其試騐性質，與舶來品較，有過而無不及，現女士正在堪米內次工廠，研究製絲機器，不久回國，在靑島或濟南集資設廠製造云云。</p>
<p>考高梁，秫之別各，黏者可以釀酒，北方通稱高粱曰秫秫，有紅，白，兩種，崔豹古今注謂，秫為黏稻云云，又稭音皆，禾稿去皮也，北方呼高粱稈曰秫稭，河工用之，（載辭源）一九三四年海關統計，進口人造絲達一九·〇五〇·〇〇〇兩，殊足驚人！國內絲織品之攙人造絲，幾乎觸目皆是！雖窮鄉僻壤，無遠弗屆！最痛心者，往往在國貨工廠操勞作為國貨努力製造之女工羣，亦多身穿價廉物美之舶來人造而不之覺！鄉鎮婦女，更無論矣！</p>
<p>今全國上下，方惴惴於白銀狂流後的通貨緊縮！而慮中國幣制，有與金磅，美元或日金發生聯繫的杞憂！不知中國海關年年入超幾萬幾千萬元，實早與金磅美元或日金，發生聯繫而早自掘墳墓！人造絲之擴大至與鄉人衣着聯繫，特其一端耳！記者希望全國上下及金融界鉅子，其速羣策羣力，資助酆女士之國產稭製人造絲廠之早觀厥成！</p>
<h3 id="c153">寫給海外的留學生諸君 <a href="#c153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— 全甲</p>
<p>留學生諸君一定每天讀報章的，諸君大概沒有不注意新聞欄裏時常用大號鉛字印着的搫來貨入超的數止字吧！有時，我相信當諸君試用國貨的時候，時常會怨恨中國人自己的出品會這般使人失望。現在，諸君已長離祖國而負笈遠渡了，在目前國家經濟不景氣的時候，留學諸君也許是惟一的明燈吧！因此，我謹以十二分的希望，把幾句貢獻話，寫給出國的留學生諸君，怎樣努力國貨工作！</p>
<p>（一）自己就是用國貨的榜樣在國內，我們所看見的外僑，差不多都用本國貨的，記得有一位先生他說過；一個住在虹口的日本人家，他所用的，喫的，穿的，全是祖國寄來的。有一天，那位先生到那戶人家去，見他所喫的儘是鹽蘿蔔之類，問他從前時常喫肉，魚的，今天為什麼這般儉省了，那日本人說：「我本國貨還沒有來呀」！留學生諸君在國外，因為事實上的困難，當然不能照那個日本人這般做，不過日常用品或衣着之類，應該擇用國貨。要知道穿本國貨衣服在外國的路上走，是非常光榮的，中國留學生大都費了許多錢，買洋貨做成高貴的衣服，外國人往往笑，中國人自己沒有衣服的。留學諸君應宣一個誓：「不穿中國衣服，情願永遠不喫一頓飯，不喝一杯茶！」誰服用中國貨同志，留學生諸君都齊聲大喊道：「我」！</p>
<p>（二）努力宣傳與介紹中國貨往往在國外立不住足，第一是沒有宣傳，第二是對方的反宣傳，我以為留學生諸君在國外，交友一定很廣，請把中國貨的優點，努力宣傳與介紹，使得你的朋友都生成一種信任中國貨的觀念，近來有國外貿易團等組織，如集再加諸君努力提倡，收效必大。</p>
<p>（三）自己發明和改良留學生諸君都是智識階級裏人，平素對於國貨不滿意的地方，自然有改良的能力，請自己有發明國貨或改良國貨的興趣，這又是十二分重要的。</p>
<p>總之。留學生也是學生的一種，今年是學生國貨年，留學生尤該處領袖地位，負起學生國貨年的使命來，却莫迷了海外的繁榮，忘記了貧弱無力的中國民族工業。處在今日非常時代的留學生，不能再隨隨便便了。請留學諸君在歸國之前，給我們國貨界裏一個好消息，這便是我的希望！</p>
<h3 id="c154">國貨博士 <a href="#c154" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e154" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">154</a></h3>
<p>— 吉安</p>
<p>S城中的黃先生，誰不知道他是一個誓志服用國貨的國貨博士呢？</p>
<p>的確，黃先生眞是一個道地的國貨博士，黃先生眞是一個服用國貨的信徒，他凡是用的東西，吃的食物，穿的衣服，以及其他一切生活所需，假如不是國貨的話，他寗願屏棄而不用的。就是偶然因一時的疏忽，而誤用了外國貨，他老人家也要念茲在茲，表示十二分的後悔，而深深的怨恨那欺騙他的店員呢？</p>
<p>黃先生不特對於個人的服用國貨，非常認眞，就是關於提倡國貨的運動也異常熱心，，所以不論什麽提倡國貨會，××國貨會，他好像是藥料中的甘草，都去參加的，每逢開會的時候，他也必登台演講，大談其提倡國貨之道，結果，黃先生當選了××國貨會的委員，和××主席，他對於一般人們的推舉，起初總是表示力不能勝，但是，結果為了國貨運動，只得屢辭不獲的担任下來。</p>
<p>他看見人們穿西裝，着皮鞋，吃大菜，坐汽車，非常反對，不認識的人，就在背後駡他，說是不愛國，準亡國奴，認得的呢，黃先生就老實不客氣的當面敎訓了，說什麽「禮義廉恥，國之四維呀！什麼中西合璧，成何體統呀」！嘮嘮叨叨的說上一大篇，使得對方非常難過，往往面紅耳赤，唯唯而退。</p>
<p>因此，大家遇見黃先生，都稱他為國貨博士了，黃先生也欣欣然有得意色，雖然，在博士的名銜中，尙未聞有所謂「國貨」其名者，然而，我們的黃先生，現在倒是大家一致承認國貨博士了。</p>

<p>— 甲辰生</p>
<p>北方呼小孩為娃娃，本文所寫娃娃親事，也就是北方的一種奇異的風俗，同時，也可以說是複雜的中國婚姻史中特殊的一頁。</p>
<p>娃娃類的事實是這樣的，北方因為開化較遲，民間的頑固性非常深刻，重男輕女的觀念，更是厲害，為父母者，對於男孩子，十二萬分的寳貴，對於女娃兒家，看得連糞土都不如。所以，比較上稍為富有的人家，如果得子得得遲，一旦生下一個男兒來，不但比什麼都稀罕，第一個重要問題，便是小孩子才一週兩歲，就趕緊化上幾個錢，替小孩子娶上一個年巳及笄的媳婦來家，算是盡了做父母的大責任了。</p>
<p>女的到了男家，先以父母禮見翁姑，以弟視丈夫，那麼，這媳婦應盡的義務，等於人家雇用的保姆一樣，對這幼小的丈夫，飲食起居，要完全負責，白日裏的穿衣喂食，夜晚裏倚懷睡眠，甚而至於家庭裏一切縫紉燒煮洗滌掃除等等，也都是這媳婦分內的事。</p>
<p>等到這幼小的丈夫，由孩提而少年，長成了人，便選一個良辰吉日，正式行合卺禮，可是這一雙璧人，一個是年才弱冠的少年，一個是半老的徐娘了，根本上妻的年齡比丈夫要大上一二十歲，這種老陰少陽的夫婦，在北方是不足為奇的。</p>
<p>可是能够把丈夫撫養成人，居然也舉案齊眉，這女子雖然辛苦了十多年，辜負了靑春，還算是大大的幸福，設若，那幼小的丈夫，髫齡夭亡了，女的便得矢志守節，做終身的寡婦，還要被人咒罵伊是掃帚星，尅夫命，敗家精呢，直到死了才乾凈，眞是人世問的慘事，毫無人道可言，至今河北省的淸宛廣平等縣還盛行着這娃娃親的怪俗。</p>

<p>— 惟經</p>
<p>這一遭，跟着朋友，搭了一晚夜航船，總算又嘗了一回上一個世紀裏的生活。</p>
<p>在月光下面，在傾斜的山坡下面所夾着的一條水道中，藉着四個壯漢的拉牽之力，行進着。水聲嘩拉嘩拉，很有節奏的在船底下發出來。岸上是靜寂得只有遠遠地傳來的狗吠聲，和十分陰慘的梟鳴聲。此外是一些聲響都沒有了。岸邊的草，吞噬了拉牽者的足部。疎疎的樹影，活像一個個鬼影，撲上船舷來。　　　船中，是擠滿了人。小小的艙中，搭客有四十左右，男的女的，老的少的，村的俏的，都有。我和朋友，搭的是全船只有二間的小房間。雖然只有一張僅容二人的板舖，但這比了搭統艙的三四十人，已舒服得多了。不只可坐，還可舒展着腿躺，還有一個獨用的美孚燈。</p>
<p>朋友是只等船行動時，便呼呼地打起鼾來了。我老是睡不過去。到半夜一點鐘時，在統艙中的混雜的鼾聲中，忽聽一聲尖銳的女人的驚呼聲。我吃了一驚，探出頭去一瞧，在半明的一盞美孚燈光下，見那些已醒過來的旅客，都對着一個三十餘歲的婦人傻笑。婦人的臉飛紅着，似乎想哭出來，但不開口。</p>
<p>這時朋友也醒了，笑着道，「太平凡了，我搭夜航船，十次之中，總有九次會見到這種有關風化問題的事伴的。某一次，唔……」他授了一支香烟給我，燃上了火，相對地抽着，便把話頭截住了。</p>
<p>艙裏的聲息，靜止下去了。船底的水聲，又嘩拉嘩拉的響着。拉牽的那四人，大致為了解除疲勞起見，開始着一遞一唱的哼起下流的山歌來了。</p>

<p>「不知道老佛爺今天可高興不高興？」他先向李蓮英試探着。</p>
<p>「你為什麼要問這個啊？吿訴你：今天伊老人家正在最不高興的頭上呢！」李蓮英很倨倣地說道：「如其你有什麼事情要啟奏的話，誰也保不定伊着惱不着惱。」</p>
<p>「你說的是對的，我也不知道我去把這件事情奏明之後，挨打還是挨駡；但我總不敢不奏啊：」那園丁哭傷着臉說道：「如其我今天不去奏明，明天給伊老人家自己發現了，那我的腦袋可還保得牢嗎！」</p>
<p>「哼！倒眞有你的！可是你上去回明之後，說不定就會把伊老人家弄惱了，那你的頭還是免不掉要斬下來的！」李蓮英彷彿很得意似的冷笑着。這個人原是一個心腸最毒，毫無人性的東西：他仗着太后的寵信，那裏肯把這些小太監當做人。每次逢到有那一個太監或宮女觸怒了太后，給太后吩咐拖出去拷打榜掠的時候，李蓮英老是露着一種心中暗快的神色；如其太后要把什麼人押去砍頭，他就格外的高興了。「如今你就先吿訴我，你要打算去奏明的是什麼事情啊？」</p>
<p>其時那園丁巳是嚇得面無人色了，他聽李蓮英的口氣不對，很想就此縮住了　嘴，不再說下去了；可是他自己也知道巳經說得太多了，絕對不用再想縮回去了。卽使他眞個就此縮住不說，本蓮英也一定會用私刑來拷打他，逼他說出眞情來。（四四三）</p>

<p>月英道近早兩年，開店還有點生意。到了那年荒年，過路的人，都是逃難的，做生意的外鄕客人一個月山看不到一個。不是外鄉人，是不進湖南人開的店的。我爹這就歇了買賣不做，專門種地。周太太道：不是天旱嗎？種地那裏來的糧食呢？月英道：是呵，第一年全沒有收到糧食，存糧還有的，地方上的人，因為這年沒有了收成，就不像往日那樣吃東西了，十天也沒有一天吃一回鍋塊同饅，總是用麫到了水做糊喝。日子多了，稀糊喝得人有氣無力，只好做一兩回鍋塊吃，不過在麫裏要加上麥麩，後來到了春初，就是加上麥麩，也覺吃得麥粉太多了，就在山梁子上挖了一些草根回來，用刀割得碎碎細細的，一齊和在麫裏做得吃。麫粉越來越少，草根越加得多。後來吃什麼鍋塊，就是吃草根的團子罷了。到了三四月天，天上還是不下一滴雨點下來，大家整日的抬着頭向天上望着，不但心裏難過，而且也很害怕，若是地上再沒有糧食，地方上人，不都要餓死來嗎？我爹就說，若是這樣再乾下去，就是草根，也恐怕吃不着，這只有一條路，趕快的回湖南老家去。可是湖南老家，到甘肅有好幾千里，這樣一家人，就是一路吃飯，也非二三十塊錢不能到，這又只有一個笨法子，自己帶着乾糧，一面吃，一面走路罷。（二四七）</p>

<h3 id="c175">法蘭西的雄婦人（上） <a href="#c175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— 海</p>
<p>我國名優梅蘭芳氏，以天賦的美男子扮作女兒身，眞的是維妙維肖。他在舞台上演劇時，無論舉手，一投足，一開口，全是女性化，幾乎使人瞧不出男子來。年來他的足跡，已遍及日本和歌美各國，人人見了都歡喜讚嘆，因此而有「雄婦人」之稱。但他下台之後，依然同復男裝，過他男子的生活。不道法國在路易十五世代，却有位武士，並不演劇而扮作婦人，幷且過着婦人的生活，至於四十年之久？這眞是一件希有的奇事，是不可以不記。</p>
<p>這雄婦人是狄洪武士，Chevalier　d'Eon在法國重裝騎兵營中任司令之職，他生若一副瘦小的身材，玲瓏而活潑，一頭豐厚的頭髮，細得像美人見的靑絲髮一般；更奇怪的他的眼眶裏包含着很多的眼淚，隨時隨地會得哭將出來。他在路易十五世朝中，以美男子聞名，因便負着外交上的使命，被派到俄羅斯去。那時俄羅斯的皇后向來不願接待法蘭西的男子，狄洪沒法觀見，甚是焦灼，忽然想起他曾在化裝跳舞會中扮作女子，於是决章穿了女衣覲見俄后</p>
<p>他然儀態萬方的去了。只為他大生的美貌和化裝的見肖，竟些兒破綻都沒有，俄后的侍女們都以為他是一位法國的女官，請他到伊們的妝閣中去，和他說體己話兒，幷將伊們的情史吿訴他，那知道他實在是個鬚眉男子呢</p>
<p>後來他又奉了秘密的使命到英國去。倫敦某大家特地舉行一個歡迎會，所有各國的大使和爵爺·貴族等，都來參加，盛極一時。當時許多男女貴客中，有一位從俄羅斯來的達斯高夫郡主，一見了狄洪，似曾相識，原來伊在聖彼得堡時常常和他往來的。這時見他忽作男子的裝束，很為詫異，於是他在俄羅斯時化裝女子的事，便宣傳開去了。</p>
<p>那時倫教的交際社會中，引起了一種賭博狂，大家都出了很多的錢，下注打賭，要知道狄洪究竟一個男子呢或是女子，幷且給了狄洪一萬五千金鎊，要求他担任最後的評判。他很為生氣，忽的流下眼淚來，一面漲紅了臉，嬌怯似的垂下了睫毛，告訴他實在是一個女子，不過自幼兒扮作男子，因為他的父母沒有兒子，這也是慰情勝無的意思。當下人家即忙把這消息傳了開去，人人信以為眞，而狄洪却在暗晤地匿笑。他既厭倦了倫敦，就想回到他的祖國法蘭西去。</p>
<p>這時路易十五世的孫兒當國；這位小路易却是很幽默的，他說狄洪回國時，要是回復了騎兵營司令的裝束，那麼他和苟希氏一家，曾有宿怨，非彼此决鬥流血小可；所以他必須扮着女子回來——否則取消他的恩餉。</p>
<p>這雖是小王和他開頭笑，而手段却是很辣的，狄洪在英國曾負着債，全仗恩餉敷衍過去，一聽了取消的話，如何不急，於是不得不服從小王的命令。小王因了他的可憐的請求，特許他佩帶聖路易的十字勳章，這是他先前因勇敢而得到的，幷給他保留騎兵營中的制服全套和軍盜手槍，佩刀，槍刺等物，作為紀念。</p>
<p>他回到了巴黎，就逢了小王之命，到他所指定的一家成衣店去，做了許多女子的綢衣，羅裙之類，開始扮作女子。他躊躇了一下，心中覺得根受不了便咒駡了一聲，拋開那五光十色的女衣，重又穿上了他營中的舊制服，逃到他兒時的故鄕湯納爾村中去，躱在萄園中，不敢巴拿馬來。但他捱過了一月，困於經濟，不得不回到巴黎去，以綺尼佛小姐的名義，出現於社會中。</p>

<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>療癢肺病者精神上之痛苦。當比肉體上多。而經濟之威脅為尤甚。故實行療養之前。經濟方面必須預先充分考慮。因經費中途告盡。時有發生悲慘結果者。</p>
<p>經濟的療養之主眼非節省各種療養生活費。在節約全體之療養費。換言之。即在早日達到全治之目的。欲達到全治之目的。欲達到此目的。必須就診正式專科醫師。能澈底的實行諸療法。并嚴守醫師之指導。忍耐於修養。如此則治療期間必可簡短。其結局為經濟的。倘最初之療養法不完全。使恢復期延長。其結果仍為不經濟。</p>
<p>或說肺病為富貴病。以療養肺病須費莫大金錢。實屬謬見。其實用普通生活費已能各療養上之完美結果。所以肺病療養之能完成與否。并不在療養費之多少。而在病者之擇醫是否正當。與乎自身之能否努力。</p>
<p>療養肺病。非必須轉地。或住入療養醫院。若於自宅能革新生活。由專門醫師協助。愼行根本療養方法。亦可得完美之結果。</p>
<p>肺病療養為一種持久戰。毌迷信轉地之效。浪費金錢。徒使經濟上加重負擔。故經濟無餘裕之病人。用於轉地或住院療養之金錢。不如作自宅療養之持久費為得計。</p>
<p>肺病在家療養。須就近覓一正式的專科醫師。如期前是門診。以求適當之治療。并嚴守醫師之指導。如能決心遵從。則與住院之效果只有過無不及。</p>
<p>上海市民療養院所訂之「肺病長期治療包費辦法」即為經濟病家而設。輕者祇須包費數十元。即可負責醫至痊愈為止。（醫藥·注射·診金等費一槪在內）。旨在使患者不為經濟所困。能無憂無慮。而持久於三當療養。安然至於全治。此種辦法。實為解決療肺經濟問題之良策。誠平民病家之福音也。</p>

<p>— 沈兆荃醫師</p>
<p>肺癆雖為頑固之疾。但非絕症。病者如於早期診察。及時謀適當之療養。十九可獲痊愈。惜我國民眾昧於醫學常識。當病在初期。不求科學之診斷。且放任不治。或妄從舊醫「陰虛損弱」之說。而一誤再誤迨病者深入三期。始登科學醫之門。懇切求治。故接近吾等之患者。大半屬於重症。已難能為力矣。惟醫者負有救人天責不可不於無可設法之中。而思有挽救之策也。</p>
<p>自一八八九年以後。如Bruns　ate　xander　Kuchard,　Moralt諸氏。對於第三期肺癆。推窮於施行之時。若以樟腦葡萄糖。溶液Glucoso　and　Campbora　Solrtion施行靜脈注射。（每天一回）同時并以「肺活」Phith　Weal內服一日三次。每次二食匙。能使進行性者。可變為靜止性。滲出性者可變為硬化性。凡肺癆患者。經過此種療法後。則喀痰容易吐出。氣急舒平。盜汗自止。且食慾增加。熱度漸降。病人之精神。覺得非常爽快。常得驚人之效果。</p>
<p>重症肺癆之豫後。固不能預料。然在他法盡窮之際。倘採用此法。或有治愈之一線希望耳。尚有一節。須附述者。本療法非治療三月以上。不能達到全功。病家宜忍耐以行之。如時時中輟。或半途中止。則前功盡棄。永無痊愈之望。病家其注意焉。</p>

<p>— 姜冠羣醫師</p>
<p>臟器療法之使用於民間。由來已久。徵之民間之傳說。裨史之記。載古來每不少以動物或人類之臟器乃至排泄物治療疾病之事實。惟相傳沿用。初無學理的說明。致大好療法。迄未正式施用於治療界。故雖有數千年歷史。竟絕無進展。至Claude　Bernard房氏始以近代科學的研究漸開內分泌學的緒端。而臟器療法。遂抵於成。該氏研究之結果。認為身腺性臟器除通常之分泌即分泌外。尚不絕的產出特有特質而輸送血中之機能。是即名內分泌。其後一八八年Brorn　Ceorards氏繼Clarde　Bernard而研究。更見進步。用睪丸越幾斯一再試驗。遂得下述之結論「睪丸內分泌抽出外。能亢進動物體之生理的機能。挽回生殖器之萎縮。增進食慾。旺盛精力。」於是所謂臟器療法。遂告大成。</p>
<p>馮於男性生殖腺荷爾蒙之臨床的適應。綜合近代各學者之報告。大槪如下。</p>
<p>（甲）對於神經衰弱。尤以生殖器性神經衰弱。如陰萎。勃起力減退。早漏。遺精。快感缺乏。</p>
<p>（乙）新陳代謝機能沉衰症。心臟代償機失調症。一般消耗衰弱症未老先衰。</p>
<p>男性生殖腺荷爾蒙之製劑。名目繁多。而效力更不相同。於臨診上之應用。為醫界所推獎者。首推德國製「還爾童」Well　Tonic最為有效。</p>
<p>據余之經驗。神經衰弱患者於服用「還爾童」Well　Tonic後。能使各種神經性病苦緩解連服十日至十五日。則萎靡倦怠。睡眠不安。食慾不振等徵象。均得挽回。對於生殖器性神經衰弱之患者。一方嚴守攝生。禁止房事。按日服食「還爾童」Well　Tonic經五十餘例之實驗。均奏意外之效果。患者自覺輕快。而不民眠。腰痠。心悸。健忘。遺精。及陰萎等症。皆先後相繼消失矣。</p>
<p>以上所述。為余最近之實驗。其功效實超出一切荷爾蒙製劑。用敢記錄本刊。以作諸君之參考介紹焉。</p>

<p>— 虹口產科醫院　何澤銑女醫師</p>
<p>吾人於臨床上。恒見有種婦女。多憂鬱而喜服藥。自以為病入膏盲。惶惶然不可終日之勢。若詢其所苦。則滿身是病。而又說不出所以然。其普通之症狀。如頭痛神疲。腰酸不舒。畏寒失眠。食慾不振。喜怒不定。疑慮多夢。心神不安。健忘急燥等。而細察其原因。多由月經不調所致也。</p>
<p>月經不調。乃婦科中最普遍之疾病。故調經藥品。亦為婦科中不可缺少之藥劑。查市上發售之調經藥品。雖風起雲湧。名目繁多。按諸實際。其功效有吾人所期望於理論者。殊亦鳳毛麟角。即偶有一二精品。又因價值昂貴。令人有不敢嘗試之槪。</p>
<p>近有美林登西藥行獨家經理之「美奴寗」Menorrin係依照中西著名之婦人科醫院內經驗良方。集數十種珍貴調經養血強健子宮等藥。并用我國古來推獎之婦科名藥「當婦」之精華。配合製成。對於月經不調而起之諸症。例如經來腹痛。月經閉止。朋經過多或過少。腰背酸痛。赤折帶下。宮冷不姙等。功效靈確異常。</p>
<p>余自得「美奴寗」Menorrin於臨床上應用以來。向所視為難治之婦人神經衰弱與月經不調症。皆能迎刃而解。而無一不滿意。甚而有遠戚。客居他鄕。其夫人病而函詢於余。則勸其服「美奴寗」Menorrin不一月而復書感謝矣。惟應用此劑。需稍忍耐連服數瓶。始奏不效。若欲求速則勢所不能。而實際「美奴寗」Menorrin應用於臨床，往往有出人意料之奇效。我國婦女之患氣血虧損與經病者特多。是與健康至有關係。「美奴寗」Menorrin出。不啻為婦女界增一健康保險也。</p>

<p>近世治癆內服藥誠多矣。汗牛充棟。指不勝屈。但用諸臨床之實驗。其能收美滿效果者。則為鳳毛麟角。至於廣告上所載之藥品。雖極力鼓吹其效能。實則全無實益。徒資遺害而已。有時雖可止咳。乃其所含之安神劑之力。并無根治功效。況從來肺病內服藥中之配劑。皆不外幾怪·鈣·燐·魚肝油等類。此種藥物。或僅獲效於一時。或祇適合於初期。或多服則敗胃。或久服不能中斷。要皆非治肺病根本良藥也。</p>
<p>近有「肺活」Phith　Weal者。余認為肺癆病內服藥中之翹楚。雖未能謂有特效。允可推為內服療法藥中之巨擘。據歐美學者之報告。各國醫家之實驗。確認為現今肺病內服治療劑中之最安全最有效者「肺活」Phith　Weal須獨佔首席。本品係由哺乳動物新鮮肺臟及脾臟中提出之有效成分所製。對於肺臟病灶呈直接作用。填補其缺損。調和保持其機能。同時在病灶之周圍。築成鞏固結締織之墻壁。使之硬化。促成瘢痕之形成。完全包裏惡魔之結核菌。而令自滅。且此種肺脾臟之有效成分。更有促進血液之凝固力。故「肺活」Phith　Weal對於防止出血（咯血）之作用。功效尤為顯著。</p>
<p>「肺活」Phith　Weal以肺脾臟器之成分為主劑外。尚合有卵黃素（即類脂質）Lccithin等滋養強壯藥品在內。故用後能造血肥肌。使體力旺盛。挽回日漸消失之生活機能。增加天然抵抗疾病之能力。使患者速離病體。而於極短期間痊愈。古人云「良醫治未病」。凡患神經衰弱，體質虛損之人。最易發生癆症。如服用「肺活」Phith　Weal可使身體健康強壯。得增加抵抗傳染之勢力。故服用本劑者。得「有癆者治癆」—「無癆者增進健康預防肺癆」。防治咸宜之功能。</p>
<p>余自得「肺活」Phith　Weal應用於臨床以來。治療各期肺痨症。不下數百餘例。均奏意想不到之效果。大率輕者一月。重者亦不過二三月即愈。無不得心應手。藥到病除。確為肺病內服藥中之冠軍。茲將本藥應用之成績略述於左。</p>
<p>（一）用本藥後。其有效成　分被吸收。包圍結核之病灶。而築成鞏固結締之墻壁。防止微生物之蔓延。且微生物因缺乏營養。而逐漸死滅。因之寒熱·咳嗽·咯血及一切病象均見迅速消退。</p>
<p>（二）連服數星期後。即見面容紅潤。精神飽滿。不復如以前之萎靡不振矣。</p>
<p>（三）「肺活」Phith　Weal內所含成分除肺臟製劑外。尚有卵黃素·肝臟腺荷爾蒙。睪丸腺荷爾蒙等生精補血之珍品參合其中。故患者雖服「肺活」一種但所得之效益則勝用藥劑數種。適合經濟。</p>
<p>（四）氣味甘美易服。雖婦孺亦落於取用。頻頻服之。食慾自振。身體日健。「肺活」為臟器製劑。其中絕不夾雜化學等有害特質。故雖常年服用。亦無絲毫流弊也。</p>
<p>夫「肺活」有如此美滿之成績。決非尋常療肺各藥所可望其項背。茲述數語。為海內病者告。</p>
<h3 id="c181">選擇補藥的常識 <a href="#c181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— 高寳銳</p>
<p>吾國自古以來。補藥的觀念。入人最深。所以補藥的需要。也特別繁多。試看就診病人。動輒以有無補藥可服相問。使可想見一班。</p>
<p>在病人動問有無補藥的時候。我輩醫師倘無相當對付。彼等心中必頓起疑念。而漫說吾輩不知補藥。所以此等對付。未始不於信用有關。然而思欲對付。則實際上卻也無可推舉之品。蓋目今市上所販賣的強壯藥。注射的也有。內服的也有。種類之多。雖然不可計數。可是　試之下，覺得有效之藥。　　絕無僅有。所以病人問起補藥。其結果還不如以魚肝油了事。</p>
<p>魚肝油之於人體。確是好的。不過只推薦魚肝油一種。則在病人心理上。以為醫生也只知有魚肝油一種罷了。往往不能表示滿足。并且魚肝油之外。還有好的補藥在焉。</p>
<p>補藥二字。就字面而論。能補身體之不足者。謂之補藥。換一句話說起來。就是能供體內需要的。纔可當之無愧。今賦一考人體的需要成分。自以蛋白質最為重大。含水炭素及脂肪次之。至於其他無機鹽類及維他命（Vitanin）之類。究竟所需至微。日常攝取的食物中。儘足吸收應用。故非特別場合。初無補充之必要。</p>
<p>人體之需要如彼。而市止販售之所謂強壯劑者。則卻與此相反。大都只含少許燐·砒·鐵·鈣·碘·之類。於實際上簡直無所進出。所以屢次試驗。屢歸失敗。卒至醫師束手。病人絕望。共歏世界真無補藥而已。</p>
<p>夫吾人即在生活之中。體內的所有成分。當然有陸續的消費。所以不思繼續生活則已。茍欲繼續生活。自非時時補充其消費不可。不過健康無病之人。每日由其攝取食物之中。自足補其所耗。而無須另求補充。可是有病衰弱的人。如「肺癆病等消耗症」。「神經衰弱」。不能發揮其固有之本能。所以縱令多報滋養。多食魚·肉·鷄卵·牛乳·蔬菜·水菓之類。其如不能消化何。</p>
<p>況且諸種營養分之中。如含水炭素·脂肪·無機鹽類·維他命之類。其消化工作。比較簡單。故於普通食物之中。還可得到相當補充。惟是蛋白質一種。則非經過最費力最複雜的消化。不能得到最後產物的「阿米諾酸」以後。實無方法吸收。然則胃腸薄弱之人。其於日常食物之中。而欲求蛋白質之補充。不亦難乎。</p>
<p>今查補血　強壯劑滋養　「康氏生活素」（Vonbour＇s　San—Vita—Cell)是蛋白質的最後消化產生物。即所謂「阿米諾酸」的製劑。換言之。便是經過人工消化蛋白質的精華。服用以後。即可構成肌肉。製造血液。就是胃腸不良。消化與吸收無力。不能攝取食物的病人。也可以藉此而維持營養。所以從各方面觀察起來。我以為「康氏生活素Conbour＇s　San—Vita—Cell之為滋養強壯藥劑。確是甚合理想的。</p>
<p>「康氏生活素」製造上的着想點。既然如彼。近來我又徵請臨床實驗。也認為事理相符。即凡經我勸服之人。莫不稱有功效。噫嘻。醫師與病家之於補藥。際此兩感困難之時。乃有如斯良劑發現。此我之所以萬難默然而無語也。</p>

<h3 id="c182">繼「阿Q」而來的時代 <a href="#c182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— 余從予</p>
<p>我們沒有負重致遠的精神，我們沒有低頭苦幹的魄力；以前看得起中國人的稱中國人為陲獅，中國似乎也很高興自認為睡獅了，但是睡獅是怎麼樣呢？睡獅到底不是死獅，他不過睡在那裏，獅子的力量與魄力是不曾消滅，而其他四周跳梁的小動物，也正是偷偷摸摸鬧鬧而已，要吃他的肉倒底是不敢的。而且終也怕他醒來。</p>
<p>可是把中國當作睡獅的是在八國聯軍以前，後來拆穿西洋鏡，是誤把死獅當作睡獅了。</p>
<p>但是我們不承認是死，我們說我們不過暫時打個瞌睡；「當心些，朋友，一覺醒來，乫當恩報，仇當仇報！」於是中國動了，出版物中就有「醒獅」與「獅吼」之類問世，不過這只是刊物的名稱而已。</p>
<p>這就是五四時代。當時大家也似乎以為你沒有死，但是在自己身上抓抓癢又睡着了；北伐時代又似乎醒了，大家也似乎以為你沒死，可是裂裂嘴又睡着了。</p>
<p>於是人家斷定你，即使不是死獅，或者是一個活驢吧。記得柳子厚有一篇黔無驢的故事的，這似乎是說中了數百年後的現在，老虎看驢只會用尾巴驅殺身上的蚊蠅，於是就真的來咬我們試試了。</p>
<p>這樣大家覺悟了，假裝睡獅已經沒有用，本來就不是獅子，要一覺醒來變成獅子，要喉嚨發獅子的吼呌，這是太滑稽的了。於是大家又嚷出；我們要做駱駝，駱駝！</p>
<p>駱駝是什麼呢，駱駝是不心急，不煩燥，不怕吃苦，昂着首，低着心，望着無底無底的沙漠，載着可驚可驚的重量，不想偷閒，不顧路景，不貪花果不達到目的不止的象徵，這自然是對的，中國現在什麼只是起點，前途就是無底無底的沙漠，責任就是可驚可驚的載重，非有駱駝的精神是不可的。若只想一吼而成獅卻敵於萬里之外，一揚指而成飛刀，殺仇於千里之遙，那是直做到人家腸里的糞時還只是一個怪夢而已。</p>
<p>但是怎麼能够做成駱駝呢？看中國是否可以做成駱駝，這是要問問中國現在到底像什麼的？可是這個問題是一直被忽略的，人家誤碼認我們睡獅，於是自己忘了自己是耗子，就想一覺醒來而成獅，就想發點獅吼給人家聽，這是已經到處碰壁與出醜過了，但假如看見人家真駱駝的達到目的，而自己不顧自己是一隻耗子，那末化裝為駱駝想載起駱駝的重量而走駱駝的路程不也是一個夢想麼？—所以我們要鏡子，沒有鏡子，也要對池水去照照，倒底自己是什麼？</p>
<p>阿Q是代表中國人的，但是阿Q被打以後，也會罵一句「孫子打祖宗」的話的，現在似乎阿Q時代過去了，因為這種驢兒的本事我們也久沒有看見。我似乎只看見我家的「阿咪。」</p>
<p>「阿咪」是我們的家貓，牠被人從沙發上推下，就會快活地玩地下的絨線球的，如再不許牠玩絨線球，那末牠就玩自己的尾巴了，—同樣的高興，快活，無憂無慮！</p>
<h3 id="c183">自然描寫（下） <a href="#c183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>在這些詩里所表現的自然，都是正當的。這就是通過杜甫的全人格，着眼於人事者多，着眼於自然者少。自然不過作為人事底興比而搬上作品上來的。所以可免去那種泛神論的色彩。</p>
<p>但有的作者，在自然的描寫上，并不企圖神化自然。不過為想把自然描寫得更生動，將自然有神化了，不期然的露出了泛神論的影子。因為要使自然有情化，必須將自然予以擬人的寫法，使自然有一定的人格。又因過分誇大的結果，其人格必然成為無限的偉大。在此自然又與神相合一了。理裴臺夫，批評蕭洛霍夫的「開拓的處女地」時說：</p>
<p>「蕭洛霍夫在我國許多作家中露頭角的原因，是他有能用豐富的才能美麗地描寫自然的技倆。頓河邊曠野上獨得的美麗的風景，住在那里的人們底一切複雜的聲音底合奏，極其纖細有味的陰影，南方天空上豐富的色彩的變化—這些一切，都在蕭洛霍夫作品中表現出來。作者揮看極大的手腕呌讀者感到，在夏天強烈的陽光下曠野里勞働者之呻吟，感到置身於冬夜般的寂靜…在「開拓的處女地」里，自然描寫，也形成優美的詩的篇幅。這些一切描寫，更正確的說，移上在這作品中的作者底自然觀，是貫徹了偉大的灼熱的，對於無盡的生活底愛情。在蕭洛霍夫的場合，自然不是對立的無關係的權力。自然，它是千變萬化的，戰勝生活底一切障害。自然之生命與人類底生命相一致。人類底活動，現實，在自然的滾滾無盡的創生的能力中，有其反響與根據。自然不是依於抽象的合理主義而美化了的，是依於深刻的感覺的美而美化的。…人類與自然相合，且造出一種與它相共的充滿了無盡的生命的原態。…在「靜靜的頓河」里，自然與人間底這種統一與結合，到處帶着獨自的泛神論的陰影。自然與人類底關係，是超越了普通的當然的觀念，帶有什麼或物的存在。無論什麼時候，總表現着近於「自然崇拜」的態度。這在說明人類與土地的關係時，特別可以感到。土地對於蕭洛霍夫彷彿帶有什麼某種的牽引力。人類與自然如同綱似的結着。大地如有所招呼，人類即應其招呼而去。他能捨棄一切的工作暫忘了侵軋，先使大地肥壯起來…在「開拓的處女地」里便沒有這種汎神論調子了。大地仍看如一塊土地般。人類與土地的關係是單純的，執着自明的性質。這是非常好的。土地和一切自然同樣，因此一點也不失卻它的魅力。藝術的說服力量，敘事的詩的風格，祇在其蔭庇下，有點要落入於人道主義的，生物主義的自然觀。…」</p>
<p>這可見即秉有新的世界觀的作者，在描寫自然時，也不免因熱愛自然給予人類的福利，而帶上了泛神論的陰影。雖然無妨於作品之偉大，但也是應校正的一種傾向。至高爾基則又更進一步，要詩人們來向人類呼喊：跟自然門爭！支配自然了。他在他那論詩的主題一文呈說：</p>
<p>「過去的詩人們，是作為農民和地主，作為自然之子，在本質上作為自然底奴隸，而狂喜於自然之美與賜物里的。在對于自然的詩底態度里面。最普遍而且明顯地可以聽到的，是那柔順和阿諛的聲音。便是現在也還可以聽到。其實，對自然的讚詞，就是對暴君底讚詞。在那調子里，幾乎老呌人想起祈禱來的。對於自然底醜惡的暴行—例如地震，洪水，颶風，旱魃，以及毀滅數千人并破壞他們一手的勞作的盲目的自然力底種種暴發和瘋狂，詩人們則像相互約定禁口不說了。曾經想「用言語來燃燒人們的心情」（這并不曾有什麼成功）或想在人們中喚醒「善良的感情」的（這終於沒有成功過）詩人們，從未曾向為類呼喊出：跟自然門爭呀！支配自然呀！有時對於兩足的專制主雖然也憤激過來，但對于盲目的暴君，卻沒有憤激的事了。…」</p>
<p>在這里高爾基的意思是非常明白的。詩人們對於自然，決不應僅僅致其贊美與愛好就算。詩人必需喚起人們，呌知道自己有戰勝自然的力量。在此，詩人首先應對於那作為文化底根本支柱的人類勞働，給以詩化。詩人首先應對於：集團地組織起來，更改地對自然底原始力之門爭，給以詩的領域。換句話，詩人首先應對於憑其意志，更改和想象的精力來創造「第二自然」的人類的方法，給予以詩的鼓勵。所以作家們必須先建立了這樣的正確的自然觀，那麼在他描寫自然時，才不致落於泛神論的泥沼里。</p>

<p>— 黑丁</p>
<p>巴圖爾和顧冬夜</p>
<p>拖着疲倦的步，幽靈似的我終於從斯扎克山腳下一個古喀小村，來到一個靠河近旁的布萊雅人的瑙河瑚村落。路上因為受了一囝風雪的吹揚，害得我底腦袋有些發暈而沉痛。渾身熱烘烘地活像一團燃燒的火。</p>
<p>呵，我是病了。</p>
<p>投宿在戈久烈老頭子家里。晚上，我底心緒紛亂而煩擾。病，把我陷入了一個可怕的境地，我茫然地感到寂寞與孤苦</p>
<p>黑夜總包圍着這寒冷的瑙河瑚的幾家人家。從遠處的幽谷的山林里透過來幾聲稀疎的微弱的犬的呌囂。清澈的二月的月光，漫灑着這一個靜僻的村落。馬，發暴燥地在槽棚里亂蹂着蹄子。院子的樹影，繁密地，冷索索地，打着風嘯。</p>
<p>我不曾得到一個安危的睡眠。好像我底靈魂掙扎在這漫漫的黑夜里得不到歸宿似的，徬徨而悽愴。</p>
<p>呵，這廣漠的巴圖爾和碩原野，那里能够使我找到一片不像樣的藥店？更那里能够使我找到一個手術不很高明的醫生？這里是一個原始社會的縮影，文明社會的人類一切享受，還不曾輸入這一個古老的荒僻的國度里。</p>
<p>當我剛剛從一陣噩夢里驚醒來，幽黯的一屋子完全被一盞熒然的燈光彌漫了。老太婆卡妮喔魯茜，不知在什麼時候就爬起來，她坐着，佝僂着腰，顫慄地在給我撫摸着呼吸窒息的喉嚨。她底嘴里流着一道很俇　的吐沫，神氣悒鬆的在喃喃着：</p>
<p>—先生，醒来，醒来！我们并没有触怒神呀！</p>
<p>她的声音衰老而沙哑。</p>
<p>邊説，邊用一隻乾癟的枯手去推动睡在她身旁像一条死猪似的她底老頭子戈久烈。</p>
<p>老頭子戈久烈蠢動地醒了。</p>
<p>卡妮喔魯茜，便嘮嘮叨叨地把她剛才聽到關於我從噩夢中驚醒的事，告訴給戈久烈。最後，她撕開嘴皮戰抖抖地，便：</p>
<p>—你快給神去下跪吧，保佑這位先生平安安的，像我們一樣也有一個很結實的身子，永不長病。</p>
<p>戈久烈聽從老婆子卡妮喔魯茜的吩咐，就慌忙地走到一個方土臺上，跪在神龕前邊，靜靜地在那兒作懇誠的祈禱。</p>
<p>這時，戈久烈的兒子特林夫，和他的一個美麗的媳婦莎嫚莉金，突然從甜蜜的睡夢中醒來了。</p>
<p>他們驚異的凝神瞧着我。</p>
<p>卡妮喔魯茜在一邊在搜索着被她剛才推醒過來的她底十六歲的歪鼻子女兒玳娜塞的蓬亂的頭髪，一邊翕動着她底灰白而枯燥的嘴唇和我談話。因為她的滿口牙齒，被衰老的年紀剝觸去，所以說起話來喔喔嚕嚕的一點聽不大清楚。她看見特林林和莎嫚莉金醒來，就一五一十的又氫關於我從噩夢驚醒的事告訴給他們。</p>
<p>莎嫚莉金輕溫地笑了笑，臉上像浮動着一朶紅雲。她向卡妮喔魯茜瞪大了眼珠子，裂開嘴皮：</p>
<p>—好受驚慌吧？</p>
<p>卡妮喔魯茜笑了笑，說：</p>
<p>—倖虧先生很快的蘇醒過來了，末後我呌你爸爸又替他到神底面前作祈禱。</p>
<p>—天氣寒路途上，受了涼。心里發燒吧？</p>
<p>特林夫憂鬱的而且發問的口吻這麼說。</p>
<p>—嗯，嗯…</p>
<p>微笑着，我點了點頭。</p>
<p>老頭子戈久烈，從神龕那邊走回來，神氣欣喜的樣子，伸手從地下摸起一枝煙袋來，又從煙口袋里揑了一抓煙沫子，裝進煙袋鍋子里，對着燈火吸着。他向我出了一回神，便吞吞吐吐地像是對我說：</p>
<p>—神準會保佑的，神準會保佑的。</p>
<p>那個健壯的，年紀有二十六七歲的高個兒，長着兩隻粗胳膊而臉肉胖胖的，在兩道濃眉底下深箝着兩隻很圓很亮的眼珠子的特林夫，由他的形貌上很難以找出一個懦弱無能的。看他的樣子，在他底世界里即沒有悲哀，也沒有快樂。他是這巴圖和碩原野的新青年的典型。</p>
<p>偎在卡妮喔魯茜老太婆懷里的玳娜寨，搖着大嘴，流着鼻涕，傻兒瓜似地這麼問我：</p>
<p>—嘻嘻，你怎麼不回你的家？嘻嘻…</p>
<p>我并不注意她，隨着我的沉默，她卻又要張口和我嚕囌，但被老太婆一頓叱恨，她老老實實地只是翻動着眼皮望我底臉。</p>
<p>莎嫚莉金呆了半晌，寂寞地這麼問我：</p>
<p>—先生，你在什麼時候來到巴圖爾和碩原野的？</p>
<p>—三個月以前。</p>
<p>—那麼三個月以前是居住在什麼地方？</p>
<p>—沒有一定的地方，　　多博，伊克圖魯山村中，　　哈達山的幽谷里，我都去過。</p>
<p>—總是沒有一個長久安身的地方，路途上不斷的奔走，風吹雪打，很容易會長病的。唉，…</p>
<p>她有些惘然了。</p>
<p>我瞧了瞧他們都圍攏在我底身邊，這親切的熱烈的談話聲，嚷我聽來，立刻給我一個深厚的慰藉和沁人心脾的欣悅。</p>
<p>特林夫被我和莎嫚莉金的幾句談話打動着，他底臉上不自禁的浮滿了縷縷的陰晦的色彩了。想像卻給他一個超然的憤慨，他用憂鬱的眼光，環視着我底週身，呵，我底週身已掛蓋了一層旅途的風塵與憔悴的夢影。</p>
<p>那彷彿使我聽慣了的慈祥的母親的愛惜的聲音，卻從他底喉嚨里冒出來了：</p>
<p>—好朋友，你好容易來到我們這瑙河瑚村，我希望你就住在我們家裏吧，倒方便，你不要太拘束—這是我底爸爸，這是我底媽媽，這是我底妹妹，再就是我和我底妻。</p>
<p>親熱地和我說了這麼一大堆。一回兒，他的聲音突然洪大了一些，一種同情的，有力的話，卻異樣的刺激着我底心：</p>
<p>—好朋友，你的病是會好的，你不要悲哀。離開家的人，要學勇猛，果敢！像我們布華雅人，像索倫人。</p>
<p>這是一個有爆發力的炸彈，深深地投在我底心中。</p>
<p>—呵，呵…</p>
<p>我底一顆浮動激跳的心，卻開始被這爆發的炸彈炸得粉碎了！</p>
<p>外邊仍然是夜。夜裏仍然是括着風。</p>

<p>— 家為</p>
<p>第六屆全國運動會自雙十節國慶日開幕後，在「新上海」的市府前新建價值百餘萬的巍峨莊麗的市運動塲上，在幾十萬觀衆熱烈的擁護之下，全國各地的名將選手，果然一再創下了許多破大會，全國，甚至遠運記錄的新收獲，這是值得人們所快慰的。至於，在大會里為了選手參加二單位的資格問題，而引起糾葛；更有無數的選手們（名將呢）的臨時托詞棄權，都顯示了一般人對於參加大會的本意跟抱負的眞面。這不能不認為是遺憾而有待選手們以至一般人們的注意——運動的眞義究屬為了什麼？</p>
<p>講到大會選手中問威名赫赫，「婦孺皆知」而最出風頭的要算香港女游泳選手「美人魚」楊秀瓊女士了。</p>
<p>果然，「美人魚」自從上屆運動大會成名以來，眞可成了社會上一個大家（尤其是一般慕其名，其人的大人，哥兒們）所關心着的紅人，要人了。記得在上次大會閉後，有滬平聯運通車，請她來行剪彩禮。創太極操，提倡踢建，放風箏的老「運動健將」，特備了馬車親自駕駛請她遊京市覜光，她回去了，各地報紙常常登載着她的消息，尤其關心她的婚姻大事。今年，某地游泳池落成，特從千里外備幾千金路費接來行下水禮。</p>
<p>這次來了，除碼頭上歡迎者擠得人山人海，要經男選手們保護着突圍而出，那樣的熱烈，那樣的盛况之外，更有旅館備函邀請免費居留，並外備車馬接送，而報館更有特約記者為她每日作日記——早起夜睡，一日三飱，都一分不錯的把她照抄登載出來。眞可謂受盡了各界人士的歡迎，誰能及上她，天之驕子！</p>
<p>然而，事情却出人意料，十七日的五十公尺游泳決賽可糟了。你看：「五十公尺賽後，楊小姐屈居亞軍，出水後左右淸淸，無人過問；粉臉含暈，眼眶若不勝傷楚，獨自垂頭喪氣，逕往休息所，嚶嚶啼泣。此乃為女士自享盛名以來，第一次為人壓倒了也……」</p>
<p>「粉臉含暈」，「垂頭喪氣」，「嚶嚶啼泣」，是多麼够人心動呢！這將急煞了一般關心她的人們。</p>
<p>不過，在五十公尺預複賽，百公尺自由，仰游賽，我們的「美人魚」仍創下了驚人的新記錄，果然不負衆望，願「美人魚」勉之！</p>
<p>本來，運動塲上要角逐，要競爭，是必然的，然而，這並不是好勝，爭風於一時。這是每個選手們都要明白的。尤其我們是處在「此時此地」的時代與環境里，一切都是在矛盾，競爭，鬬爭，……靑年們將怎樣去更進一步的認識社會，認識自己的責任而準備着去參加這最大的競爭，不，是鬥爭！</p>
<h3 id="c188">寂寞底院子 <a href="#c188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— 新野</p>
<p>是一個深秋底黃昏，那深沉孤寂的院子也像夜一般的躺若了。週遭是靜靜地，彷彿聽見有一隻小蟲在屋簷角爬過，爬過了秋海棠的花瓣，又爬過了修長的蕙蘭葉子；似乎那些花瓣和葉子已在發三輕微的顫悸和歎息。但，不久這僅有的聲息也靜止了。這里所撇下的，仍是那碧澄平靜像一片柔波的夜色。在月色朦朧，星光依稀下，可以隱約地看出院角里山茶花的黑影，牆外的木穉花樹雖祇伸出幾根枝幹，但那陣陣的桂香，却儘可由那秋夜的輕風帶過來。淡淡的月光浮映在那些花葉上，彷彿似波面上浮泛着一層靑色的幽輝或銀濤。</p>
<p>翰獨自個兒披了一件睡衣，在書桌上的那隻冷落了好久的古銅香爐里，揷上了三炷福建檀香。他就凭倚着階前的朱漆攔干站着，痴望着那檀香上噴出來灰白色的烟，裊裊地向窗外飄出去，但接着就消失在這廣漠冷寂的院子裏了。</p>
<p>——那古老的院子呵，它永遠是寂寞着的啊！</p>
<p>夜，那無涯的夜，正如這院子一樣的廣漠冷寂，更像他這一顆心一樣地凝滯徬徨。他靜靜地站在那兒，他在沉思；不，他在咀嚼人生，他在摩撫那為生活而受創傷的心靈，他因為需要靜，所以拋棄了朋友，拋棄了愛，拋棄了一切，從很遼遠的地方跑回了這里來。這古老的院子里面。</p>
<p>「吱—吱—吱—。的從院階底下擠出了幾聲尖銳的叫聲，帶着點陰濕，像是從遼遠滾來一片碎玉，跌落在飽滋着水澤的靑苔上，然而却又像山路一般消失了。</p>
<p>——這是沒有伴侶的孤獨的秋蟲啊—牠也像人們一樣在感到寂寞的悲哀麼？</p>
<p>他漸漸地舉首起來，仰望着天空，天幔上是貼着一個不十分完整，也不能說是怎樣殘缺的毛月亮，在她的週圍却繞着一道很大的光圈，傍邊的幾顆星子却在很俏皮的，若隱若現的映着眸子。</p>
<p>老瘦了的黃花無聲無息的蹲在院的一角，它像是一個垂死的老人，那麼頹喪着神色，不像先前幾日的有生氣了。金魚缸里雖仍然矗立着那座假山石的陰影，但已不能辨認它玲瓏織巧的秀岩碧峯，更看不見上面這些靑葱可愛的普洱草。這蕭殺的深秋之夜只像一襲嫠婦的素衣，它飄起了那淡淡的哀愁。</p>
<p>他的意念只像一樓輕烟，鏢渺地，茫然地，縈迥在一種不可捉摸的追憶中；更如一隻迷途的孤烏，只在這夜之海里徘徊。一種記憶，和一種希望，還有一種生活，如一根通天的丈量尺般的在前而拖了過去，似乎要想把這遼遠的渺茫的生之旅程度量一下，前面究竟還有多麼長，多麼遠？</p>
<p>默默地，把視綫又移上了窗口，窗口那裏古銅香爐里却依然在飄着淡淡的烟頭，但是那烟已微弱得幾乎像一縷細小的遊絲；那個給套在光圈里面的毛月亮，也已蒙上了一層雲翳。於是這院子，這週遭，也頓時就連這一點慘淡的光彩也盡失去了。將手扶上了那已給夜露浸濕的朱漆欄干，一絲寒冷如織細的褐色小蟲般地從他指尖上直躦進去，爬入了心底深處，紆旋地盤踞在他的心窩里，將他的心嚙着，陡然問使他猛可地打了一個寒襟，把手連忙縮了回來。院門口那株凋殘的老梧桐樹上飄下了一片枯葉，悄然地跌在他跟前，擦着欄干發出了冷然的輕響；地疑惑是他底靈魂無聲地墜入了空虛和黑暗的深淵里去了。</p>
<p>——過去的日子呵，眞是一個悠長的春夢……</p>
<p>一個過去的舊懷又夢幻似地掩進了他底心頭，於是，積鬱在他心頭的悽凉也給逗了起來，數年來的舊創新痕又復很鮮明地，熱熟地上升了，大顆大顆。淚珠是從眼眶子滑到了睫毛尖上，凝結成了晶榮的珠子，如草墓上的一滴露珠，那麼光圓地沒有微風來搖撼它，也會不可重拾地墜在階上……</p>
<p>——那古老底院子呵，它永遠是寂寞着的啊！</p>

<p>— 家人</p>
<p>一黃昏</p>
<p>抖去了一整天累積着的渾身的疲乏，人頓鐵的輕鬆下來。屋子已漸漸幽暗到伸手瞧不淸楚，但我不喜歡在此時撳了根烟，靜靜地移着腿子站到窗邊，靜靜地承受着帶點薄凉的晚風的吹拂，靜靜地鑑賞窗外在濃厚的暮霧的飛撲中緩緩地湮沒的屋子模糊的輪廓，樹林的模糊的影子，而在黃昏到來之前，原野的郊外上是有着為了歇宿而躑躅着的跋涉的旅人，和趕路者怱忘的踪蹤，也有着投巢的歸鴉黑色盼翅膀，惆悵於溟濛的天體下的。</p>
<p>彷彿一位盛裝笑盈盈的姑娘，又彷彿一個可怕的夢魔，黃昏，她帶來了玫瑰的芬芳，散佈在有了暖和的住屋，每個人的想思里，開着燦爛的憶念的花，但她同時製造出許多愁惱和焦慮，在郊原間徘徊着的不知去向旅人的心上。於是對於遠方夜的都会一幅迷人的臉孔，在年紅燈的電網交織里邊，在黑暗的某角落，又映出生了各樣離奇的事，墮落的圓面，我却是用着神秘的心緒去沉思和和領略的。</p>
<p>二流浪</p>
<p>好像是根悾惚，又好像隔半輩子那樣悠長，來到這都會里已經有好幾年的時間了，到而今，對於這里的許多街道，許多住宅，甚至於許多人的面孔，都有如老朋友一樣熟悉的。但自家終覺得這里並不是可以久居的地方、終以為會有一日轉向別處去，而且給遺落在遼遠的後邊還有一個家，一個生長我的故鄉。雖然現在十分淡漠地，不大想起了。對於故鄉，對於家，就在回憶的時候，也只能用着一種悵惘的心情去感傷地冥念，為着連自己都不知道幾時才得回歸可愛的故鄉，也許不幸的命運已暗暗的住定我只有永恒的流浪的旅程的勞苦，以結束這一生，再沒有重見故鄉的機緣。而這些日子，從那個城市到這個城市，孤單的漂蕩生涯是過慣的，自個兒彷彿水上一售船「隨着波流四散地飄，到處都可停靠，也就到處為家，到此刻是極度疲乏了，長長的流浪歲月，賜給我的就祇是一背窩沉重的風塵的壓積，和一顆空無所有的心，却亦沒有了掛處，沒有了悲哀，但同時又沒有了希冀，沒有了理想，甚至於夢。我是知道烟霧為什麼要嬝嬝地從窗口飛出來，星星為什麼要在天上閃眼，湖水為什麼因風要起漣漪，杜鵑為什麼要在半夜哀啼，知道了這些，於是我安然自己的流浪，對一切無感傷也亦無追懷。</p>
<p>三都市生活</p>
<p>沉浸在夜以繼日喧閙着的，機械的聲響，車輛的聲響，各種聲響混合成的特有的都會的騷音，再加上那瀰天的濃黑的煤烟，節直會叫人悶得透不過氣來，出了門回來，就是一鼻子的髒骯，和滿臉的灰塵。在都巿裏的人們，的確單以那囂雜的騷音便足使你患了歇斯迭里症的。而逐漸地，你的情感越來，越稀淡下去，幾乎稀淡到完全失掉祚用這時感覺也一天天的遲鈍起來，好像自己已經變為一座無性靈的機器，對什麼毫事件都漠然的不上一點興緻來，每天沒有絲微的活潑的情緒，機械地過着日子。生活是一池死水，永遠打不起波浪，而生命更是累墮的東西，無謂地浪費着。眼見許多人，終日用着强烈的感宦享樂來麻醉自己，讓精神匍匐於物質的樊籠之下。時間的在人們的眼底好像停止不流動了。是時間的足踪是急速地從人們的身邊馳駛過去，不過是人們不曾引起怎樣的驚異而已。於是誰都瘋狂地，痛性地捲歿在一切亡女淫蕩的圈子中，盡力爬上火山口去，却沒個想到鬱壓的火銀不久會爆發，而把自己的軀殼燒成灰粉的，在火山口上嘻嘻笑着游人啊</p>
<h3 id="c190">胡同裏 <a href="#c190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#e190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— 綠葉</p>
<p>—古城印象記</p>
<p>在平常的日子，小胡同裏有二種聲音，添增了古城的灰色和寂寞：白天是瞎子的算命鑼，夜裏是打更者的梆子，那是有着中古時代的風趣和蘊着遼遠家鄉的懷念吧。</p>
<p>在小胡同裏，除這種年代悠久的古舊的聲音以外，是貨郞的小搖鼓的聲音，可是貨郞却在大街小巷各處跑動，每隔二三天來一次：所以每天胡回裏祗有着這二種聲音，敲穿了別人的夢，敲穿了古城的心。</p>
<p>每天在太陽曬上了屋脊的時候，胡同裏靜得沒有一片風；於是算命瞎子敲着算命鑼，也許他已熟悉了哪家姑娘有多少年紀，和哪家是有着一個孤零零的年老的寡婦，兒子是遠征在外鄉的；他也摸準了胡同裏那一塊石頭的高低，在胡同裏迂緩地走着，讓太陽光晒上自己的面頰。那算命鑼在手裏「可噹！可噹！」敲呀敲的，饗在岑寂的胡同裏。這時胡同裏有一個小女孩子尖口的喉音，叫着那算命瞎子，我知道是那對門的年老的寡婦，又喚那小使女叫着瞎子預兆一下兒子在外的吉和凶了。這樣盲目問一下，是可以放下那老人家心頭的一塊大石頭的吧？我且不管這種愚蠢的迷信行為，却為着這一個孤零零生活着年老的寡婦祝福。</p>
<p>古城的胡同也是灰色的，在白天裏常會瞧不到一個孩子；倘使要竊聽着孩子們天眞的笑語，溫暖了遊子的心房是沒有的呢。有的，是白堊剝落的灰色的牆，灰色的屋頂和灰色的沙子：什麼都塗上了灰色的色素，所以古城也叫象徵着一個人的暮年哪。黃昏時下弦月才掛上屋尖角上面，胡同已沒有一個鬼影子；在胡同裏一步一步地走去，可以聽到了自己步子聲和衣角的一片風響。再晚些，是年老的打更者來了，在小胡同裏敲打着竹梆，同白天裏瞎子的算命鑼一樣，敲醒了別人的夢：而在夜晚胡同也只有這一個聲音呢，也只有他一個子統治着這胡同。</p>
<p>每天聽着小胡同裏這二種聲音，常常使我想着故鄉裏的一隻關於瞎子和打更者的童謠，裏面充滿着粗野的農村趣味。（可是在古城裏，反而沒有一隻童謠，關及到仙們離開人羣生活的人）。在兒時，我同孩子們常跟在瞎子後面跑，邊高唱着那只童謠，使那瞎子只擺着一副尷尬面孔才有趣：孩子時的心情，並不是奉災樂禍，却是湊個景兒吧了。可是現在在古城流離，聽着梆子和算命鑼聲音；孩子的心情我早已沒有，這隻童謠也忘記大半了。</p>

<p>「幾家歡樂幾家愁」，這是多麼使人傷心的字句，尤其在這世亂年荒的目前，人世間的不平，在這短短的七個字裏，已經暴露無餘，直偉大啊！這一首民歌。</p>
<p>富有者食山珍衣錦繡，當他們聽到這一首民歌的唱出，自然不會感覺到什麼的。像子芳夫婦一樣，在他們高朋滿座，對月飛觴，而唱出這「月兒彎彎」民歌的時候，純粹是一種隨口的抒發，並沒有想到這就是後來他們一家的寫照。</p>
<p>假使沒有山洪的暴發，他們的一家是安樂地過着的，决不會有子離妻散的結局，彼此各個間的性情也不會轉變得這樣快，但是人間是很少如意的事的，每一個人的生命史上更不會、永遠是平凡的記載，終該有一個曲折，來點綴着。這一個「月兒彎彎」的五幕話劇，也就是叙述着人生的離合悲歡，人性的險惡，以及女性專事依賴丈夫的可怕。當他們離散後的夫婦，過着異樣的生活，在三五團圓之夜，重唱着這「幾家歡樂幾家愁」的這首民歌，彼此自然有着不同的感覺，丈夫子芳失掉了曼珠，却另有嬌艷的貴族小姐伴着，當然會覺得今勝於昔。不過在曼珠方面，目前的境况，過去的歡娛，兩相比較起釆，一定會感到悲慘，傷心。</p>
<p>明星公司這一次大規模的話劇運動，是由胡蝶領銜，全體男女明星演出的。加以「月兒彎彎」這樣一個哀艷動人的故事，轟動一時是可以預料的——這一個良好的機會，希望愛好話劇的覜衆們——不要錯過。</p>

<p>British Parliamentary Re-election Set for the 14th of Next Month</p>
<p>(London) Prime Minister Baldwin announced this afternoon in the House of Commons that the general election is scheduled for November 14th. He also stated that the new Parliament will convene on November 26th to elect the Speaker, and the King will attend on December 2nd to hold the formal opening ceremony.</p>
<p>This afternoon, the House of Commons reconvened to debate the international situation. The Prime Minister began by stating that the work mentioned by Foreign Secretary Hoare yesterday had received the unanimous support of the entire cabinet. Eden, stationed in Geneva, was constantly in contact with his colleagues in London, and all agreed with his actions. Eden will address the House this afternoon. The Prime Minister continued, saying that the events of the past seven weeks and yesterday's debate have proven that the government's policies have been supported not only by the British people but also by the entire British Empire. The Dominions have not hesitated to make adjustments to the sanctions plan. The only possible course of action we are taking now is to be absolutely faithful to the League of Nations Covenant and to prepare to seize any legal opportunity to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute. This resolution must be satisfactory to Italy, Abyssinia, and the League of Nations to be considered fair. What the former League of Nations easily accomplished is clearly impossible in today's League, because the world's three most important powers are now outside the organization. The lesson learned from the current dispute has shown that for the sake of world peace, our national defense must be stronger than it is today. He does not mean to take unilateral rearmament actions, either in reality or in imagination, to deal with any one country, but to strengthen national defense within the framework of the League of Nations. Baldwin concluded that if he does not have the power to remedy the defects in national defense, then he cannot bear the responsibility of any government. (Reuter's telegram, 23rd)</p>
<p>(Rome) Efforts to resolve the Italian-Abyssinian dispute through diplomatic means are still proceeding in an optimistic atmosphere today. British Ambassador to Italy Drummond and Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Suvich met again today "to seek to improve the environment." A foreign affairs spokesperson said that the Italian side still needs to study the full text of British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech in the House of Commons yesterday before expressing an opinion.

<p>Alexandria: Fifty-one British warships and three transport ships are concentrated in this port today. This coincides with the news that Italy is continuing to concentrate troops, aircraft, and tanks on the Libyan border. (National Telegram, 22nd)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding the measures to ease relations between Britain and Italy, Britain has proposed withdrawing the two battleships "Renown" and "Hotspur" from the Strait of Gibraltar to their home country, while Italy would withdraw a portion of the troops stationed in Libya. According to information obtained by our reporter, British Admiralty experts do not object to the withdrawal of warships, but the government has not yet made any decision. How this matter should be handled depends on the progress of the current negotiations. Italian sources believe that if the troops their country has sent to Libya in Africa must be withdrawn to their home country, then the sacrifice they have made is greater than Britain's withdrawal of warships, because the strength of the British fleet in the Mediterranean is still far superior to that of Italy. In British naval circles, it is said that this view is not accurate, because the "Renown" and "Hotspur" together total 88,000 tons. Once they are withdrawn, the British naval advantage in the Mediterranean will be insignificant. Regarding this, official sources claim that the governments of all member states of the League of Nations should notify the League of Nations of the measures taken to implement sanctions by October 31st. It is feared that it will be difficult for Britain and Italy to reach an agreement during this period. Based on this, official sources, who were originally optimistic about British-Italian relations in recent days, are now deeply concerned that the final solution may require a long period of negotiations to obtain.

<h3 id="e3">Naval Assistance to Britain: Contents of the French Reply Divided into Two Parts <a href="#e3" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c3" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">3</a></h3>
<p>(Paris) Regarding the matter of requesting French assistance when the British fleet is attacked in the Mediterranean, the French government has already replied to Britain some time ago. This reply has not yet been published, and only the general outline is known to the outside world. According to "L'œuvre," the content of the reply is divided into two parts. The first part recounts that the French government notified Clark, the British ambassador to France, on October 14th that the British and French interpretations of Article 16, paragraph 3 of the League of Nations Covenant are completely consistent, that is, it advocates that Britain and France should provide mutual assistance in the three areas of naval, land, and air forces. However, since the League of Nations has only decided to implement economic sanctions, the above-mentioned assistance should currently be limited to the implementation of these economic sanctions. According to "L'œuvre," the first part of the French government's reply is to state that France can assist the British Navy, but only in the event of an unreasonable invasion by the Italian Navy. The second part of the reply states that the negotiations previously conducted between the British and French governments were limited to discussing economic sanctions, and that other issues such as blockading the Suez Canal or blockading Italian seaports were not considered. The final paragraph of the reply proposes that Britain and France conduct open and honest negotiations to clarify everything and clear up the existing uneasy situation. The newspaper concludes by saying that in order for Britain to obtain French military assistance, it must be unanimously approved by all member states of the League of Nations.

<p>Dominions and France Will Follow Suit, the US Will Not Consider This for the Time Being</p>
<p>(London) After the British government explicitly prohibited Italian ships from docking in British ports for more than 24 hours, official sources recently stated that the government's action was in accordance with the 1907 Hague International Neutrality Convention. Italy is also a signatory country and should not consider it an unfriendly action. According to the British interpretation of this convention, it is divided into three levels: (1) Italian cargo ships loading grain from British colonies and transporting it to Italian Eritrea or Somaliland will be regarded as warships and will not be allowed to dock for more than 24 hours; (2) The products of all British territories are effectively prohibited from being loaded on Italian ships; (3) Italian ships are not allowed to load military donkeys and camels, because British officials believe that these donkeys and camels are not necessary before the Italian ships arrive at the nearest port in that country and are therefore for military use.

<p>(Washington) Although State Department officials today acknowledged that the United States is a signatory to the 1907 Hague Neutrality Convention, they indicated that the United States may not follow in Britain's footsteps and implement the provisions of the convention against Italy and Abyssinia. According to observers, the United States is far from the battlefield, so the US government will not consider including the provisions of the Hague Convention in its own neutrality policy unless the war spreads beyond Africa.

<p>(Washington) The State Department today received a notification from the League of Nations, asking the US government to express its opinion on the Italian-Abyssinian issue.

<p>(Tokyo) The Chairman of the Sanctions Committee against Italy, Mr. Basgänzels, based on the resolution of the committee on the 19th of this month, on the 22nd, delivered to Mr. Yokoyama, the Japanese Consul General in Geneva, the official document informing Foreign Minister Hirota of the progress of the League of Nations' decision to impose sanctions on Italy. He believes that non-members of the League of Nations can also implement the League of Nations' measures against Italy and notifies that all means taken by non-member states on this occasion are unanimously welcome. It was reported by Yokoyama, the Consul General, on the 23rd to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. It is said that Japan's fundamental attitude towards the League of Nations has been repeatedly explained and is very clear. Not only is there no obligation to provide any political assistance, but also the formal notification from the Chairman of the Committee does not contain any specific facts requiring active assistance. However, it is advised that Japan should also take any measures against Italy in the future, but the extent of the notification is limited to this, and the notification itself does not require any response. Therefore, the Japanese side only notified the Chairman of the Committee that it had received the notification and that there was no new arrangement to be taken.

<p>Santa Monica, California: Nicholas Roosevelt, former Vice Governor of the Philippines in 1930, today advocated that the United States immediately withdraw from the Philippines. Roosevelt, who has written extensively on the Far Eastern political situation, gave a speech here today, stating that in thirty years, if no special accident occurs, we will see the Japanese flag flying over the Philippines. Roosevelt advocated concluding an Anglo-American naval treaty to ensure peace in the Pacific and stated that Japan plans to annex the Dutch East Indies because the oil produced there is essential to Japan. Roosevelt added that in the event of war, Japan will not hesitate to pursue its expansionist policy. If Britain is drawn into the vortex of a European war, then Japan will have nothing to worry about. Japan will never use its naval and land forces to seek its own ends when Britain is at peace. At this point in his speech, Roosevelt proposed that Britain and the Netherlands reach an understanding to mutually guarantee the Dutch East Indies and the Straits Settlements. Roosevelt concluded by saying that he predicted that there would soon be a movement demanding that the US military protect the Philippines for 25 years, but Roosevelt strongly advocated that the United States withdraw from the Philippines as soon as possible before the European situation indirectly draws the United States into a major war.

The bombs carried by heavy bombers are all ten pounds in weight, and are used to bomb troops on the plains, which have the effect of dispersing shrapnel, but in areas near villages and towns, these bombs cannot be used to avoid causing panic and casualties among the residents. Ciano also described in detail the methods of aircraft combat, saying that they dive from high altitude and drop bombs when they are 300 feet from the ground, while opening fire with machine guns.

<h3 id="e10">Recent Relations Between Japan and the Soviet Union <a href="#e10" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c10" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">10</a></h3>
<p>— Li</p>
<p>Conflicts occurred between the Japanese-Manchukuoan forces and the Soviet forces near Khabarovsk on the 6th, 8th, and 12th of this month, resulting in casualties on both sides. Afterwards, the Soviet authorities, in addition to dispatching more than twenty cruisers and submarines and concentrating them near Khabarovsk, mobilized 200,000 troops to Manchuria to prevent another attack by the Japanese-Manchukuoan forces. Furthermore, they instructed their ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, to lodge a serious protest with Japan and request the formation of a joint committee to determine responsibility for previous border conflicts. The puppet Manchukuoan authorities then consulted with the Kwantung Army on countermeasures and were reported to have accepted the Soviet demand to establish a joint committee. This matter has probably gradually become more moderate and should not immediately lead to significant consequences.</p>
<p>Since the September 18th Incident, disputes between Japan and the Soviet Union have emerged one after another, numbering more than three hundred to date. The easing and intensification of these disputes are invariably related to the world political situation and Japan's continental policy. After the illegal sale and purchase of the Chinese Eastern Railway was completed, relations between the two countries gradually became harmonious. However, with the occurrence of the Hebei-Chahar Incident, tensions re-emerged. The situation calmed down somewhat in February. Now, with the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian War and the unrest in Europe, and with Germany's anti-Soviet activities proceeding actively, the Japanese-Manchukuoan provocation against the Soviet Union this time was certainly also prompted by the current international situation.</p>
<p>Japan and the Soviet Union have different political systems and different beliefs, and their situation in the Far East is inherently confrontational. Moreover, Japan's continental policy must take anti-Sovietism as its guiding principle. Therefore, the evolution of the disputes between the two countries is bound to resort to force eventually. However, Japan believes that preparations are not yet sufficient. Although it is eager to try, it does not dare to act rashly. It must wait until the completion of the arc-shaped line surrounding Siberia and obtain greater control over the mainland to facilitate the supply of resources in wartime before it can contend with the Soviet Union. As for the Soviet Union, it is always on guard. Judging from the emphasis placed on locating the center of the Second Five-Year Plan's military industry in the east of the Ural Mountains and the special emphasis on cold-resistant horseback riding, ice skating, skiing, and other training for the army, this is evident. It is only because its economic construction plan needs to be completed urgently and the eastward ambition of Germany needs to be guarded against that it is also unwilling to lightly initiate war with Japan.</p>
<p>Although the opportunity for war between the two countries has not yet matured, the deterioration of international politics and the radical advance of Japan's continental policy can at any time cause the disputes between the two countries to deepen, leading to the possibility of war. In this kind of crisis, the difficulty of the position in which our country finds itself can be imagined. I sincerely hope that the people of our country will understand the dynamics of international politics and accumulate the blood and vitality of the nation to cope with the difficult situation that may become increasingly worse in the future.</p>
<h3 id="e11">Carefully Clarifying Britain's Position: Foreign Secretary Hoare's Concise Speech Summary <a href="#e11" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c11" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">11</a></h3>
<p>Resolutely Refuting the Fallacy of Semi-Independent Action, Loyally Upholding the Collective Security System</p>
<p>(London) With the British House of Commons elections imminent, the final session was held today at 2 PM to discuss foreign policy. The audience chamber was packed. Foreign Secretary Hoare delivered an important speech, providing a detailed explanation of the government's foreign policy and the Italo-Abyssinian issue. Here is an excerpt of his address:</p>
<p>Caring for Peace Without Selfish Intentions</p>
<p>"Britain, as a vast global empire, is constantly concerned with maintaining world peace. Britain's actions regarding the Abyssinian affair are entirely based on this concern, without any imperialistic selfish intentions whatsoever. To think that Britain seeks to take this opportunity to attack Fascism is absurd and requires no further refutation. All countries have the right to resolve their own political system issues. Our country is particularly unwilling to interfere in the internal affairs of other nations.</p>
<p>Maintaining the Covenant as the Sole Aspiration</p>
<p>Our only aspiration in participating in the Geneva negotiations is to uphold the principles of the League of Nations covenant. If the world does not understand and believes that Britain is acting alone in Geneva, then it should be known that the representatives of Britain and the various dominions of the British Empire attending the League of Nations conference cannot take a secondary position when discussing all major international issues. This is their duty, which cannot be shirked or concealed. Unfortunately, the Geneva negotiations cannot always be completely open.</p>
<p>Independent Action Needs No Refutation</p>
<p>If not, then the truth will be revealed, and the fallacy of so-called British independent action will be self-defeating. This fallacy not only slanders Britain but also poses a great danger, as there is no better way to plunge Europe into the calamities of war. I must also solemnly declare that the actions of Under-Secretary Eden in Geneva are in complete agreement with my own and the entire cabinet's opinions, without the slightest difference between them.</p>
<p>Diplomatic Negotiations Continue Uninterrupted</p>
<p>As for the rumors that the British government's actions on the Abyssinian issue have been too slow, and that Italy requested an explanation of Britain's position on the Abyssinian issue months ago but Britain did not respond, this is simply a misunderstanding of the truth. Since the end of 1934, Britain has been constantly negotiating with Italy on the Abyssinian issue. In January of this year, the French and Italian governments established the Rome Accords, and the Abyssinian issue was also part of it. However, France, in addition to fulfilling existing obligations and the interests of the Djibouti-Addis Ababa railway, is not interested in Abyssinia from an economic point of view. It was not until January 29 of this year that the Italian government notified the British government of the full text of the Franco-Italian Rome Accords and expressed its willingness to exchange views with Britain to ensure the harmonious development of British and Italian interests in Abyssinia. Because the Italian proposal at the time was quite serious, the British government immediately appointed a committee to be responsible for conducting a comprehensive review of Anglo-Abyssinian relations and British interests in Abyssinia to determine the attitude Britain should take. However, this type of research must consult experts and witnesses from various parties and must also consult with the governments of Anglo-Egyptian Sudan and the British colony of Kenya. From this, it can be seen that if Britain could not respond to Italy's proposal in a timely manner, the reason was that Italy's actions in Abyssinia progressed too quickly, preventing the British government from taking a leisurely and cautious approach to long-term planning.</p>
<p>Seeking a Solution Without Bias</p>
<p>It is also inaccurate to say that the Abyssinian issue was not included on the agenda of the Stresa Conference. At that time, the British, French, and Italian delegations discussed the issue, and the Italian government was fully aware of Britain's views. Britain also expressed its hope that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute would be resolved amicably. It can be seen that since the beginning of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, we have always shown Britain's attitude, not allowing Italy to have any doubts. Not only Britain but also the member states of the League of Nations have been preparing to find a way to achieve an honorable resolution to the Italian-Abyssinian dispute every day, every week. Now, I take this opportunity to reiterate that the Italian-Abyssinian issue must be resolved within the framework of the League of Nations. The government has never taken an extreme attitude and has not shown partiality towards either Italy or Abyssinia. Members of the House can all recall that, not only that, I dare to confidently say that I was the first responsible politician to remind the world to acknowledge Italy's rights to security and economic expansion. However, the final resolution of the Italian-Abyssinian issue must be honorably accepted by the League of Nations and the three parties of Italy and Abyssinia.</p>
<p>Leaving Room for Breath Before Sanctions</p>
<p>Now, before economic sanctions take effect, we still have room to breathe and take the opportunity to conduct negotiations and seek a resolution. Why is it impossible? Moreover, Italy is still a member state of the League of Nations, which is the most gratifying thing. Italy is not only a member state of the League of Nations with us but also an old friend and our old ally. If we say that at this final hour, we can no longer have the opportunity to seek a resolution and must take further action beyond difficult economic measures against our old friend, why must that be the case? Furthermore, the Italian-Abyssinian issue is not merely a local dispute in East Africa but a much more significant issue. Whether there is still some hope for resolving this issue is not something I know. However, our vision looks far into the future of humanity, and our aspiration is to maintain the principle of collective action. Therefore, no matter what, we must still hope that the terrifying conflict will quickly come to an end.</p>
<p>Important Test of Collective Security</p>
<p>As for military sanctions, this must be collectively agreed upon by the Geneva side. However, this kind of collective agreement does not exist. Since the outbreak of the Italian-Abyssinian dispute, we have declared that although we are prepared to participate in all actions within our capacity, our actions should be limited to the scope of collective action. The word "collective" must be given special attention, as it is the soul of the League of Nations. French Prime Minister Laval has already stated this in his speech in Clermont-Ferrand. We have not proposed any military measures to France. We now only have one thought: if treaties continue to be violated, then the League of Nations and our civilization cannot continue to survive. Currently, our difficulty is that some foreign countries, although they know that there is no perfect solution, still do not have the courage to face the facts. They often criticize the League of Nations, saying that it cannot fulfill its obligations. However, when they need to fulfill their obligations to the League of Nations, they often shy away. In short, the great experiment we are currently undertaking is unprecedented in the world for generations. The mechanism of collective security is now being tested for the first time. If the trial is successful, we can easily sit back and watch its effectiveness. If the trial is unsuccessful, then all those who advocate not using war as an instrument of national policy will feel a major blow of disappointment. If this experiment fails, then those who participate in action with a hesitant attitude should bear a heavy responsibility. In conclusion, if collective action is reliable, we should recognize it. If collective action can gain our trust, we should also recognize it. If so, then who are those who faithfully support the collective security system, and who are those who verbally call for supporting the collective security system but attack and provoke the countries that implement collective security? We should be able to distinguish between them," he concluded. (Havas News Agency, 22nd)</p>
<p>Speech by the New Leader of the Labour Party</p>
<p>The new leader of the Labour Party, Attlee, rose to speak, stating that the Labour Party's policy is based on prioritizing the interests of the League of Nations and the entire world over the needs of national interests. He welcomed Foreign Secretary Hoare's position of upholding the League of Nations covenant but did not agree with the British government's past passivity, as the current situation is largely due to the lack of action in the Sino-Japanese dispute. The Labour Party supports economic sanctions and the League of Nations system, but the League of Nations must become a vibrant organization in the future. He advocated that the British government should abandon any preferential treatment granted by treaties to eliminate the various suspicions that others have about Britain having a special relationship with the Abyssinian issue. The Nile River water source should be resolved by the League of Nations, Egypt should be allowed to terminate its current relationship with Britain, and Sudan should be placed under the trusteeship of the League of Nations. Attlee then attacked the government's policy of heavily expanding armaments, stating that the Labour Party is prepared to support the armaments necessary to fulfill Britain's obligations to the League of Nations, but it cannot give the government a blank check. The Labour Party plans to go to the polls with the party platform of socialism and peace, believing that the two are inseparable, he said.</p>
<p>The Liberal Party Expresses Its Views</p>
<p>Sir Samuel rose to say that the Liberal Party is willing to support the government and urge the League of Nations to adopt a constructive peace policy and establish mechanisms to alleviate suffering. Regarding this, Sir Samuel said that the current nine political entities occupy three-quarters of the world, while the remaining fifty countries occupy only one-quarter. Countries such as Japan, Germany, and Italy have actually been isolated. Regarding this issue, he advocated urgently seeking an economic solution.</p>
<p>Lansbury Ends the Debate</p>
<p>Former Labour Party leader Lansbury spoke from the back row, stating that the economic problems facing today's civilization cannot be resolved by collective security or force. Britain should make a bold and generous gesture, inviting all countries to hold a conference to discuss how world products can be distributed and declare to the public as an example, "We are willing to place everything into the common distribution." The debate ended at this point, and it was decided to continue the meeting tomorrow so that the Labour Party could present a motion of impeachment on unemployment on Thursday (Reuters News Agency, 22nd).</p>

<p>(London) During today's debate on foreign affairs in the Upper House, many speakers expressed friendship towards Italy. Lord Londonderry, Minister and Leader of the Upper House, reiterated the government's policy, which was largely the same as what Foreign Secretary Hoare said in the Lower House. Lord Snell, the new leader of the Labour Party in the Upper House, announced that the Labour Party intends to support the government but only to the extent of seeking collective security, and it cannot support the government's urgent expansion of armaments. Lord Ponsonby, a Conservative Party member, criticized Italy's aggressive actions but called Italy "an old friend of Britain" and also criticized the Abyssinian government's slow abolition of slavery and arms trafficking, saying that it would be better to entrust Abyssinia to a civilized country for trusteeship as soon as possible. Earl of Cavan, the commander-in-chief of the British forces stationed in Italy from 1918 to 1919, praised the bravery of the Italian soldiers. Lord Northcliffe, who served as Secretary of War for two years before the European War, advocated reimposing the ban on arms exports to Abyssinia (Reuters News Agency, 22nd).</p>

<p>(London) Today's speech by Foreign Secretary Hoare in the Lower House was well-received in Europe. The impression in Paris was extremely good, praising his speech for being straightforward, clear, and visionary. Geneva was also satisfied but regretted that the Foreign Secretary did not mention how to use the "breathing time" before implementing sanctions. There has been no official reaction from Rome, but the general public acknowledges that the Foreign Secretary's words were friendly and moderate, which indicates that there is no possibility of war in Europe (Reuters News Agency, 22nd).</p>
<p>(Rome) Semi-official sources have expressed some satisfaction with the speech delivered by British Foreign Secretary Hoare in the House of Commons yesterday, as Britain does not disagree that resolving the Italian-Abyssinian dispute should take into account Italy's perspective and the structure of the League of Nations, which can be seen in Hoare's speech. The semi-official sources here are particularly pleased that Hoare reiterated his guarantee that the United States will not currently block the Suez Canal and the two ends of the Italian coast. However, Hoare's speech, which firmly declared that Britain would support the League of Nations' collective action to implement sanctions against Italy, has been criticized by people here (Havas News Agency, 23rd).</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: According to a dispatch from our special correspondent Oschina, officials here expressed disappointment after British Foreign Secretary Hoare delivered a speech in the House of Commons yesterday explaining the country's foreign policy. Although they did not expect military sanctions from Britain, they still hoped that it would propose sanctions of a semi-military nature. Regarding the League of Nations' decision on various economic sanctions against Italy, officials here also expressed pessimism about whether these sanctions will be effective if certain European countries continue to trade with Italy directly or indirectly (Havas News Agency, 23rd).</p>

<p>French Newspapers Believe Reconciliation is Hopeful, Italian Newspapers Criticize with Cold Ridicule</p>
<p>(London) British newspapers have different opinions on Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech in the House of Commons yesterday. The Daily Telegraph said that since the Abyssinian war is still in Mussolini's hands, the most important part of the Foreign Secretary's speech was his powerful appeal directly to Italy. The Morning Post said that the fact that military sanctions were not discussed is welcome, but the Daily News said that the British government seems to be pursuing an incomplete policy, which on the one hand does not condone the violation of covenants and on the other hand cannot bring the aggressor to justice. The Daily Express said that our remarks only confirm the general public's anxiety and suspicion about the government's foreign policy. The Times said that for those who faithfully study British policy, not a single sentence in the Foreign Secretary's entire speech does not represent the truth. The Daily Mail said that many people now feel that trusting the League of Nations is a mistake (Reuters News Agency, 23rd).</p>
<p>(Paris) French newspapers today have commented on the speech delivered by British Foreign Secretary Hoare in the House of Commons yesterday. Le Matin said that this speech not only reassures people about Britain's future role in the Italo-Abyssinian war but also brings comfort, considering it the beginning of a peaceful resolution to the case. However, several newspapers said that the British Foreign Secretary's speech was intended to cater to popular sentiment in view of the upcoming general election (Reuters News Agency, 23rd).</p>
<p>(Rome) Only Il Popolo di Roma criticized British Foreign Secretary Hoare's speech yesterday, but in a cold tone. The newspaper's headline referred to it as "appropriate talk for domestic sales," and said that Italy is now waiting for Britain to express a word of justice, and the world is still hoping for practical peace talks. Officials did not comment on the British Foreign Secretary's speech, but most Italians are more hopeful that the Italian-Abyssinian dispute can be resolved and that the League of Nations sanctions can be avoided (Reuters News Agency, 23rd).</p>

<p>(Rome) A communiqué was released here today stating that according to a telegram from General De Bono, Commander-in-Chief of the Italian forces in East Africa, there is nothing to report on both the northern and southern routes, and the residents in the areas occupied by the Italian army have returned to normal (Reuters News Agency, 23rd).</p>
<p>Asmara: Although there are widespread rumors that a major battle between the main forces of Italy and Abyssinia is imminent, many people here now believe that if diplomatic mediation is not effective by November, then there will be a major decisive battle on the northern front before the end of that month. Italian staff officers are currently unaware of any Abyssinian forces gathered in the Amba Aradam area south of Mek'ele. They now believe that this gathering will take a month due to poor transportation, lack of transport, and many difficulties in supplying food. However, Italian aircraft are still engaged in reconnaissance and are very active. It is reported that Italian aircraft today detected that the troops of General Kassa, Commander-in-Chief of the Abyssinian forces on the northern route, are currently advancing north from Addis Ababa, hoping to join the forces of General Seyoum, who commands the troops guarding Mek'ele in Tigray Province. Large numbers of Abyssinian troops are stationed near Gondar, outside the Tekeze River, and north of Lake Tana. However, the number of Abyssinian soldiers seen near the Italian front line in Tigray Province is very small, so the Italian army expects that when it launches a general offensive on the city of Mek'ele in the future, it will not encounter fierce resistance in front of the city. According to reports from Harar, everything is quiet on the southern front. However, some Italian troops are being transferred from Eritrea in the north to Italian Somaliland in the south in preparation for the start of the great battle in the Ogaden Province. According to news from Addis Ababa, the Abyssinian Emperor flew for the first time today for two hours, flying halfway to Dessie and turning back. Dessie will be the main base for the Abyssinian forces on the northern route. The aircraft used by the Emperor was a Fokker aircraft with three engines. From the sky, he saw tens of thousands of Abyssinian soldiers who had successively departed and were heading to the northern front line in the past ten days, rushing along the way. After the aircraft took off, the Emperor's close attendants were worried and gathered at the airfield, constantly looking up at the sky. After safely returning, they expressed joy and praised the German pilot's aviation skills. In the morning, the Emperor spent half an hour using hand-thrown grenades to hit targets to show his ability to aim (Reuters News Agency, 23rd).</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: General Tasfaye, commander-in-chief of the Abyssinian 7th Army defending the strategically important town of Geladi on the southern Bari Province, received instructions today stating, "Geladi must be defended at all costs." It is now believed that the fierce battle between the main forces of Abyssinia and Italy on the southern front may be seen on the Geladi to Jijiga front line. The Abyssinian army has 300,000 soldiers, while the Italian army has 130,000 soldiers. If the Italian army captures Geladi, it will eliminate more than half of the suffering experienced in the stalemated battles in the waterless plains of the Ogaden, as the Italian army can then continue to advance along the Webi Shabelle River basin (Reuters News Agency, 23rd).</p>
<p>(London) According to a report today from the Addis Ababa correspondent of The Morning Post, the East African war has so far resulted in the deaths of 20,000 Abyssinian soldiers and 6,000 Italian soldiers. In addition, 200 Abyssinian women and children have also been affected. Two-thirds of the Italian army's casualties were from the 10th Corps. According to another telegram, General Graziani today led the Somali troops forward again and has occupied the village of Qitel northeast of Donnali. Abyssinian Army Minister Getachew will personally lead a million soldiers to meet the enemy. Experts watching the front lines believe that the Abyssinian army's weapons have improved because many firearms have recently been transported after European countries lifted the arms embargo on Abyssinia (National News Agency, 23rd).</p>

<p>Addis Ababa: According to reliable sources obtained here today, after two weeks of preparation, the Abyssinian army has now arrived at the line between Adwa and Adigrat and plans to launch a counterattack on Adigrat before the end of this week (National News, 22nd).</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Abyssinian Prince Ras Desta has recently led 200,000 troops towards the Webi Shabelle River basin to resist when the Italian army invades the Ogaden Province. On the Tigray Province front, Italian aircraft dropped leaflets in the Mek'ele area, urging residents to betray the Abyssinian government. In the Walqayt area, bombs were dropped several times, but there were no casualties. There are still widespread rumors here that General Seyoum's troops are engaged in fierce battles with the Italian army, and it is also rumored that a column of Italian troops is advancing towards Lake Ashange, but the government believes that this is impossible because the climate in the Danakil area is harsh and there are many deserts, which are not suitable for large-scale troop movements (Havas News Agency, 22nd).</p>
<h3 id="e17">British Government Decides to Convene Naval Preparatory Conference: Italy and Germany Are Also Invited <a href="#e17" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c17" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">17</a></h3>
<p>(London) It was learned here today that Britain intends to invite major naval powers to a conference to be held in London in early November. Italy and Germany are also among those invited. The main agenda item will be the mutual notification of shipbuilding plans among the various countries (National News, 22nd).</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of the Navy studied the contents of the British government's invitation to the Japanese military disarmament conference on the 22nd. The British government, in accordance with Article 23 of the treaty, proposed to hold a conference of the signatory countries of the Washington and London treaties in London starting on December 2nd. France intends to invite Soviet Russia, Germany, and other member states of the League of Nations to participate in the conference. According to the Japanese government's speculation, the British government intends to convene a five-nation conference first, and if there is hope, then convene a general disarmament conference of various countries in the world. On the Japanese side, due to treaty provisions, it will naturally attend the conference, but the agenda and other hopes will be decided after the official invitation arrives (Japan United Press, 23rd).</p>
<p>(London) According to naval observers, part of Britain's desire to ease the tensions caused by the Italo-Abyssinian dispute lies in allowing Italy to participate in the future naval conference. The British government is very hopeful for a naval limitation policy. The Washington and London naval treaties will both expire at the end of next year. The two treaties stipulated that a naval conference be convened before the end of this year. Therefore, Britain held preliminary naval talks with the United States and Japan separately at the end of last year and hoped to have similar talks with France and Italy to find a basis for future naval treaties. During the preliminary British-Japanese-American naval talks last year, Britain initially proposed (1) quantitative restrictions and (2) graded restrictions. However, because Japan refused to consider them, it suggested qualitative restrictions on the tonnage and gun caliber of each warship. In addition, each naval power would mutually notify shipbuilding procedures. This suggestion has been accepted by the United States, but Japan has attached conditions, namely that the maximum total tonnage of the navy should be equal for Japan and other countries. As for Italy and France, they have not yet responded to the above suggestions. Recently, because time is pressing, Britain has contacted the countries concerned through diplomatic channels and announced that a preparatory meeting will be convened on December 2 of this year and will end in January next year. It also advocates that the nature of this conference should not be too formal, and the participating countries can only be represented by the ambassador to Britain and the naval attaché without having to send special representatives. Naval observers here believe that since the United States has accepted the British suggestion, Italy and France will soon accept it as well. Therefore, whether a naval agreement can be established depends on Japan's attitude. However, due to the current Italo-Abyssinian dispute, the diplomatic relations between Britain and Italy are tense, and Italy's participation in the conference is inevitably hindered. Britain is so eager to ease the diplomatic situation with Italy, and this is one reason (Havas News Agency, 22nd).</p>

<p>Taipei: Japan considers Southeast Asia its southern lifeline and has decided to actively advance south. The Taiwan Governor-General's Office is the main base for the southern advance. It is currently planning a ten-year plan to acquire hegemony in Greater Southeast Asia. This time, when Taiwan held an unprecedented exhibition, it specially set up pavilions for Southeast Asia, Fujian, Siam, and the Philippines to encourage Japanese and Taiwanese people to advance into Southeast Asia and South China. In next year's budget, it will set up a Southeast Asian Trade Specialization Department within the Taipei Higher School of Commerce and also open night classes to teach general Southeast Asian knowledge, with special emphasis on Siamese, Malay, Dutch, French, and various dialects of Chinese, such as Chaozhou and Cantonese, to learn the skills to be active in Southeast Asia and practically advance into Southeast Asia (China United Press, 23rd).</p>

<p>Fragrant River Order Gradually Restored; Peasants Enter City and Form Maintenance Committee, Appointing New County Magistrate; County Magistrate Zhao Secretly Arrives in Tongzhou, Ordered to Return to Original Post; Tongzhou Garrison Deployed to Suppress Riot, Gradually Pacifying</p>
<p>(Beiping) After the peasant uprising in Xianghe County, County Magistrate Zhao Chongyi had secretly fled. The peasants entered the city yesterday and organized a temporary maintenance committee, with local notable An Houzhai as the temporary county magistrate. According to Shang Zhen's written reply to reporters' questions, the conflict between the Xianghe militia and the county government was due to the manipulation by unscrupulous gentry in the county. The county magistrate has left the county, but local order has gradually been restored, and the situation will not escalate. The provincial government has dispatched Councilor Liu Yaodong to thoroughly investigate the matter. After obtaining detailed information, concrete measures for handling it will be decided. To maintain peace and tranquility, it is planned to dispatch a portion of the 32nd Army to suppress the uprising. I am scheduled to return to Baoding within two or three days. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) This afternoon, Shang Zhen sent Counselor Zheng Wenxuan to the Japanese Embassy to visit military attaché Takahashi, expressing that the Xianghe incident would be resolved peacefully. After the outbreak of the Xianghe peasant uprising, Zhang Qingyu, the commander of the First Regiment of the War Zone Security Force, came to Ping this morning to report the latest situation in Xianghe to the Ji-Mi District Office. It is rumored that similar incidents have occurred in Sanhe, Wuqing, and other counties due to the Xianghe peasant uprising, but relevant parties have strongly denied this. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The rioters in Xianghe had not retreated by the night of the 22nd. All gates of the county town were tightly closed and fortified with sandbags, guarded by the security corps. The rioters focused on the east gate, constantly clamoring and firing guns. The whereabouts of County Magistrate Zhao Xiyu are still unknown. The chief of the public security bureau, Bai Chunzhi, and the chief inspector, Bai Xiangshun, were detained outside the city in the Chenghuang Temple. One battalion of the 135th Division of the 32nd Army has been concentrated in Tongzhou awaiting deployment. The rioters issued absurd declarations on the 23rd, exceeding the original four demands. Tongzhou was placed under martial law on the 23rd, with County Magistrate Cao Zhen and Public Security Bureau Chief Wang Xiu guarding the city with police forces. Zhang Qingyu, the commander of the First Security Regiment, went to Ping early on the 23rd to meet with Shang Zhen for instructions. It is heard that the leader of the rioters, Wu Zhenyi, has been arrested by the Japanese army and sent to Ping for questioning. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The Military Branch held a routine meeting on the morning of the 23rd, attended by Bao Wen-yue, Shang Zhen, Qin Dechun, and more than ten others. Bao Wen-yue presided over the meeting. After passing several routine cases, Shang reported on the Xianghe peasant uprising. It was resolved that the provincial government would be responsible for handling the matter. Also, Shang sent personnel to the Japanese Embassy in the afternoon to explain the Xianghe incident, deciding to resolve it peacefully. The Japanese side was quite understanding. (23rd Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) The provincial government appointed Councilor Liu Yaodong as the acting county magistrate of Xianghe. Liu, escorted by one battalion of the 32nd Army, went to Xianghe today to take office but was rejected by the rioters. Liu is currently in the city. (23rd Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telephone call from Xianghe on the afternoon of the 23rd, many people have gathered again in the villages outside the city, and efforts are being made to resolve the situation. The order within the city is still good, with the local police maintaining public security. It is also reported that there is instability in Sanhe, but the situation is not very serious. Security teams in each county have been dispatched to strictly guard against any escalation of the situation. (23rd Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) Regarding the Xianghe peasant uprising, relevant parties received a telephone call from the county on the 23rd, stating that the rioters entered the city on the afternoon of the 22nd, and County Magistrate Zhao Xiliang and other staff members abandoned their posts and fled. County administration is currently without leadership. According to Shang Zhen's reply to reporters' questions, the disappearance of the Xianghe County Magistrate has been confirmed. The provincial government has sent personnel to investigate thoroughly. Zhang Qingyu, the commander of the First Security Regiment, and Li Yun-sheng, the commander of the Fifth Regiment, both came to Ping on the morning of the 23rd to meet with Shang and report on the defense of each county. (23rd Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) It is reported here that villains in Wuqing and Changping counties are also inciting troublemakers to riot. Bai Jianwu's bandit gang previously attempted to launch an uprising in Zunhua and other places, but because it was detected and suppressed, they knew they could not succeed and secretly hid in counties bordering the war zone, plotting a comeback. Bai himself issued orders from Dalian. It is heard that the Japanese side is very dissatisfied with this and hopes to eliminate them as soon as possible. (23rd Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to a telephone call from Tongzhou on the evening of the 23rd, County Magistrate Zhao Xiyuan of Xianghe arrived in Tongzhou at noon on the 23rd and reported to the Ji-Mi Special Office. At the same time, Provincial Councilor Liu Yaodong and Meng Zhaoen, the commander of the First Security Regiment, also returned to Tongzhou from Xianghe to investigate. As a result of their joint deliberation, it was decided that since the rioters in Xianghe had dispersed and the situation had stabilized, Zhao was ordered to return to the county to resume his duties and be responsible for handling the issue of tax increases. Zhao immediately complied with the order and went to the county. Also, An Houzhai, who was elected as the acting county magistrate by the rioters, also came to Tongzhou on the 23rd to welcome Zhao back to the county. One report said that An had been detained, but the truth remains to be seen. (23rd Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Baoding) Regarding the Xianghe peasant uprising, the provincial government dispatched inspector Wang Runsheng from the Department of Civil Affairs on the morning of the 22nd to investigate and handle the matter. At 5:00 PM on the 23rd, Wang reported to the Department of Civil Affairs by telegram from Tongzhou that the garrison in Tongzhou had been deployed to Xianghe to suppress the uprising as appropriate. The city gates had been opened, and order was gradually being restored, but County Magistrate Zhao Zhongpu and Chief of Public Security Section Bai Chunzhi were still missing. According to Li Peiji's statement to reporters, the rioters' claims of opposing tax increases were not true. According to another report, the Xianghe incident was initiated by the local unscrupulous gentry Wu Huan (i.e., Wu Yi). Wu and Bai Jianwu are sworn brothers, so there may be some collusion between them. (23rd Central News Agency)</p>
<p>(Beiping) According to news received at night, the Xianghe Security Corps had opened the city and surrendered to the peasants. After the peasants' initial attack on the city failed yesterday, they gathered a large force again in the evening and approached the city. The Security Corps, seeing that they were outnumbered and to avoid bloodshed, opened the city and admitted them. After entering the city, the peasants immediately organized a Security Committee and appointed Hu Yuting (transliteration), the leader of this uprising, to preside over everything. An Houzhai, the former president of the Beiping Chamber of Commerce, was elected as the county magistrate. As of yesterday, six Japanese plainclothes ronin who participated in the riot were detained by the Japanese military police. There have been no further reports, and it is now believed that they have been sent to Tianjin. (23rd Reuters)</p>

<p>Total exports exceed 13.37 million yuan, total imports exceed 27.5 million yuan, and total import surplus exceeds 14.13 million yuan.</p>
<p>Gansu's trade statistics for the first half of this year (January to June) have now been formally published by the Gansu Department of Finance based on commodity tax receipts and are listed below for the reference of those concerned about the trade situation in Gansu.</p>
<p>(A) Exports totaled over 13,372,362 yuan, including 3,740 dan of hides and skins, valued at 6,732,415 yuan, accounting for 50.35% of total exports; 35,552 dan of medicinal materials, valued at 2,986,335 yuan, accounting for 22.33% of total exports; 36,326 dan of wool, valued at 817,341 yuan, accounting for 6.11% of total exports; 99,376 dan of shredded tobacco, valued at 656,288 yuan, accounting for 4.90% of total exports; 272 dan of sheep casings, valued at 544,960 yuan, accounting for 4.06% of total exports; 519 dan of food, valued at 519,300 yuan, accounting for 3.90% of total exports; 5,927 dan of cotton tobacco, valued at 518,976 yuan, accounting for 3.89% of total exports; 56,842 pieces of timber, valued at 284,210 yuan, accounting for 2.12% of total exports; 1,368 postal parcels, valued at 164,160 yuan, accounting for 1.20% of total exports; 1,352 dan of bamboo ware, valued at 80,965 yuan, accounting for 0.60% of total exports; and 499 dan of other goods, valued at 67,413 yuan, accounting for 0.48% of total exports.</p>
<p>(B) Imports totaled just under 27,507,200 yuan, including 15,290 dan of food, valued at 15,289,530 yuan, accounting for 55.56% of total imports; 13,431 dan of foreign cloth, valued at 2,887,576 yuan, accounting for 10.48% of total imports; 19,566 dan of sundries, valued at 2,636,466 yuan, accounting for 9.57% of total imports; 2,520 dan of cotton goods, valued at 1,547,293 yuan, accounting for 5.60% of total imports; 5,663 dan of porcelain, valued at 1,260,800 yuan, accounting for 4.59% of total imports; 9,104 dan of paper, valued at 1,001,486 yuan, accounting for 3.65% of total imports; 5,739 postal parcels, valued at 688,680 yuan, accounting for 2.52% of total imports; 7,939 rolls of native cloth, valued at 555,730 yuan, accounting for 2.02% of total imports; 269 tickets of official tea, valued at 473,616 yuan, accounting for 1.73% of total imports; 3,726 twists of metal, valued at 279,464 yuan, accounting for 1.02% of total imports; 1,746 dan of other goods, valued at 261,915 yuan, accounting for 0.56% of total imports; 144,484 draws of bulk tea, valued at 216,726 yuan, accounting for 0.79% of total imports; 3,605 dan of cotton, valued at 173,063 yuan, accounting for 0.63% of total imports; 203 boxes of cigarettes, valued at 101,525 yuan, accounting for 0.37% of total imports; 143 boxes of cigars, valued at 71,380 yuan, accounting for 0.27% of total imports; and 31 dan of silk fabrics, valued at 61,940 yuan, accounting for 0.23% of total imports.</p>
<p>Comparing the two sides of imports and exports, hides and skins have been the largest item in exports in the last half year, accounting for more than half of the total amount, followed by medicinal materials and wool, and other types of goods are the least. In the last half year of imports, food has been the largest item, accounting for about 60% of the total amount, followed by foreign cloth and groceries, and silk fabrics are the least, accounting for only 0.23% of the total amount. It can be seen that the people's livelihood in Gansu Province is declining. Apart from the daily necessities of clothing and food, there is no other purchasing power. As for the import surplus situation, it is as serious as ever. The total value of imports and exports in January was 7,240,625 yuan, and the import surplus was 4,802,976 yuan. The total value of imports and exports in February was 5,281,997 yuan, and the import surplus was 3,090,316 yuan. The total value of imports and exports in March was 8,387,418 yuan, and the import surplus was 678,482 yuan. The total value of imports and exports in April was 6,873,553 yuan, and the import surplus was 1,003,175 yuan. The total value of imports and exports in May was 7,886,243 yuan, and the import surplus was 2,693,810 yuan. The total value of imports and exports in June was 5,209,723 yuan, and the import surplus was 1,866,079 yuan. Although the import surplus amounts for the above months vary due to seasonal factors, the statistics for the first half of the year reached a huge amount of more than 14,134,800 yuan, which is enough to make people worry about the future of the social economy in Gansu Province. It is now learned that the Director of the Finance Department, Zhu Jinglei, is studying how to remedy the trade import surplus problem. In addition to revising import tax rates and increasing import taxes as a passive resistance, he also intends to promote local products as a slightly positive supplement in order to reduce the import surplus.</p>

<p>A dispatch from Kyoto states that the Communication Office in Kyoto for the representatives of 39 ethnic groups in the northwest of Kangzang recently received a report from Xikang. The Xikang Pacification Commissioner, Nona Hutuktu, has been in Kangding for nearly two months since being appointed. The Living Buddhas, abbots, managers, and lamas of the red and yellow sects from various places have traveled long distances to pay homage. Although the Living Buddha Nona is over 70 years old, he is energetic and tirelessly receives people day and night, vigorously propagating the central government's power and virtue. He has successively convened representative conferences from all sectors several times and has decided on several important cases: (1) To awaken the entire population to support the central government, urgently seek unity, and assist the national army in suppressing bandits, while training the people to organize local self-defense to prevent future troubles; (2) To achieve a great religious union, engage in rectifying religious rules, improving old systems and bad habits, promoting the true meaning of religion, and saving the world's people; (3) To eliminate all past Kang-Han divisions, guide emotional harmony, and jointly plan the construction of Xikang. The people of Kang generally express sincere love and respect for Living Buddha Nona's pacification efforts, his promotion of virtue, his concern for the people's suffering, and his prescription of appropriate remedies. The people, from now on, have leadership and will not engage in actions contrary to the central government. In the future, everything in Xikang will be impressive.</p>
<h3 id="e80">Eight Months of Trade in Fujian Province This Year <a href="#e80" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c80" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">80</a></h3>
<p>Far Removed from the Prosperity of the 18th and 19th Years of the Republic; Fuzhou Customs' Trade Surplus Turns into a Deficit</p>
<p>(Xiamen Correspondence) In recent years, Fujian Province has suffered from the global economic downturn and successive years of communist banditry. The people's livelihood has deteriorated, and industries have declined, becoming increasingly severe. This year is even worse. According to customs' figures, for the eight months from January to August this year, foreign trade through Fuzhou Min Customs shows imports valued at 5,010,000 national currency units, and exports at 2,155,000 national currency units, resulting in an import surplus of 2,855,000 national currency units. Xiamen Customs shows imports valued at 10,738,000 national currency units, and exports at 2,196,000 national currency units, resulting in an import surplus of 8,542,000 national currency units. Santu'ao Customs shows imports valued at 118,000 national currency units, and exports at 3,000 national currency units, resulting in an import surplus of 115,000 national currency units.</p>
<h2>Page 8</h2>
<p>The combined totals for the three customs offices show imports valued at 15,866,000 national currency units, exports at 4,354,000 national currency units, resulting in an import surplus of 11,512,000 national currency units. It is noted that Fujian Province's economy originally relied on northern Fujian as the production area and southern Fujian as the consumption area. Therefore, traditionally, Fuzhou's Min Customs has always had a trade surplus, while Xiamen has been a notorious import surplus port for more than sixty years since its opening. Considering Fujian Province's trade in the 18th and 19th years of the Republic, in the 18th year, Min Customs had imports of 8,193,618 customs taels (one customs tael is equivalent to approximately 1.5 national currency units), and exports of 14,843,900 customs taels, resulting in a surplus of 6,649,282 taels. Xiamen had imports of 17,215,879 taels, and exports of 3,909,448 taels, resulting in a deficit of 13,296,431 taels. In the 19th year, already affected by the global economic panic, Min Customs had imports of 6,718,175 taels, and exports of 8,845,953 taels, still resulting in a surplus of 2,127,778 taels. Xiamen, due to the sharp rise in gold prices and soaring foreign exchange rates, saw overseas Chinese rush to remit funds back home to invest in land and construction, hence the year saw increased prosperity. Imports reached 22,027,7018 taels, and exports reached 3,591,905 taels, resulting in a deficit of 18,435,113 taels. Trade at Santu'ao was minimal, similar to the present situation. Min Customs' surplus in the 18th year of the Republic, when converted to national currency, reached 10 million units, whereas in the eight months of this year, it has reversed to a deficit of over 2 million units. Moreover, the total value of imports is less than a quarter of that of the 18th year of the Republic, and exports are less than one-sixth. Xiamen's deficit for the eight months is over 8.5 million units. Compared to the deficit of over 27.65 million national currency units in the 19th year, it seems much less. However, in the 19th year, Xiamen's imports reached over 33 million national currency units, while this year for eight months it is only 10.73 million, a shrinkage of more than half. Exports in the 19th year amounted to over 5.38 million national currency units, while this year for eight months they are over 2.19 million, a decrease of 20 percent. From this, we can see the severity of Fujian Province's economic downturn. The reasons being that production in northern Fujian has lost its world market, remittances from overseas Chinese in southern Fujian have sharply decreased, consumption has been tightened, and purchasing power is weak, resulting in a large drop in land prices in Xiamen, with stores along the streets closing one after another, and many empty houses. The reduction in the value of imports also has one loophole, which is the large number of smuggled foreign goods entering in recent years to avoid taxes. According to reports, Pingtan County, an island along the coast separated from Taiwan by a strip of water, is reachable by sailboat in eight hours from Keelung in Taipei. Situated between Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Taiwan, it is actually a hub for smuggled, tax-evading foreign goods entering between Taiwan and Fujian. The main items are wool and cotton textiles, sugar, and opium dross. On average, foreign goods valued at over 500,000 units are imported into the coastal areas of Fujian Province through this route each month. The Xiamen Customs has set up a Guanyin'ao sub-station here, but only catches three or four out of a hundred cases. Recently, it has started to be more effective, with successive seizures. In addition, there are still many cases of goods being transported directly from Taiwan by sailboats or motorboats and landed in the Quanzhou, Zhangzhou, and Xiamen areas. In early October, on the Zengcuo'an coast outside Xiamen port, there was a shootout between smugglers protecting their cargo and customs patrol boats, resulting in the seizure of over ten bags of sugar. A few days ago, a German ship seized a smuggling sailboat off the coast of Xiamen, carrying 100 barrels of alcohol, 30 boxes of matches, 100 boxes of gasoline, and 32 bolts of cloth. According to the helmsman Cai Ziran, the cargo he was carrying was worth 1,900 Japanese yen and he was transporting it on behalf of the cargo owner. The cargo owner wouldn't lose money as long as only one out of every three shipments were seized. Therefore, taking a risky trip across the sea would net a profit of over 200 units. If one shipment is seized, the confiscation is worth 300-400 units and a fine of 80 or 100 units is also required. However, losing one out of three trips would still be enough to break even, and not losing in one out of three trips would already guarantee a solid profit of 600-700 gold units. (October 17)</p>
<h3 id="e81">Black Gang Kou Siphon of the Yellow River Holds Water Release Ceremony <a href="#e81" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c81" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">81</a></h3>
<p>—Six Years of Work, Partial Success in Small Test—</p>
<p>Kaifeng Correspondence: The idea of using siphons to draw water from the Yellow River to irrigate farmland was proposed in the 19th year of the Republic by Huang Fang, the Director of the Henan Construction Department. By the end of the 20th year, the provincial government officially decided to implement it. Now, after six years, the water release ceremony was held at Black Gang Kou at 2:00 PM on the 20th. Liu Zhi and other important party, government, and military figures, as well as Qu Dacheng, the representative of the Ministry of Finance, Zhu Guangcai, the representative of the Economic Committee, and observers from all walks of life, a total of more than 500 people, attended the meeting as scheduled. First, Zhang Jingyu, the Director of the Construction Department, reported on the progress of the project. Next, Liu Zhi, Qu Dacheng, and Zhu Guangcai delivered speeches, and Zhang Hanying gave a lecture. After taking photos, it was already 4:00 PM. Together, they traveled by car to visit the siphon and various projects along the Yellow River. Entering the city through the West Gate, it was already dark. Although the pair of siphons installed at Liuyuan Kou often had problems with water intake due to sedimentation in the water storage pool near the river, and only one-third of the three pairs installed at Black Gang Kou were actually passing water, it is difficult to expect them to raise the water level of the silted pool, consolidate river defenses, irrigate farmland along the Huiji River, and transform saline-alkali land into fertile land as hoped. However, the small test has been successful, and continued efforts will be a blessing for the people along the river. The following is a brief record of Zhang Jingyu's report: The purposes of using siphons to draw water are: (1) to supplement the water source of the Huiji River; (2) to improve the waterways in the provincial capital. The Huiji River was originally a major river in eastern Henan, passing through Chenliu, Qi County, Sui County, Tuocheng, and Luyi, and flowing into the Wo River, providing irrigation for farmland on both banks. Later, the Yellow River repeatedly breached its banks, and over 180 kilometers of fertile land on both banks were transformed into sandy soil. In January of the 22nd year, we mobilized labor to excavate the riverbed, as a source of water and to remove dirt from the provincial capital, and to improve the soil quality. A branch canal was opened from the east bank of the Huanghui River in Sunlitang Village in the western suburbs of Kaifeng, diverting water through the northwest city walls, into Pan Yang Lake, and further divided into east and west branches. The west branch follows the city south, passes through Bao Fu Keng Lake, turns east, and heads towards the Shuimen Dong gate in the east of the city. The east branch passes through Pan Yang Lake to the north, flows around Beimen Dajie, turns south along the east of the city, joins the west branch, passes through the Shuimen Dong gate out of the city walls, and into the Huiji River. However, this requires using siphons to draw water. Because Liuyuan and Black Gang are close to the city, with the riverbed close to the south bank, and each has a deep pool, the water drawn out allows sediment to settle, and the silted pool can increase river defense security. Therefore, two pipes were installed at Liuyuan Kou, totaling 126 meters in length, and six pipes were installed at Black Gang, divided into three locations. The first and second locations are 90 meters apart, and the first and third locations are 75 meters apart. The pipes are 118 meters long, and each pipe can carry approximately 0.8 cubic meters per second at low water levels, with all eight pipes carrying over 6 cubic meters, capable of irrigating over 200,000 mu of land. Accompanying projects include six newly built bridges on the Huiji River, five renovated houses, thirty culverts installed, four newly built bridges on the Huanghui River, twenty bridges built in the city's waterways, thirty-seven culverts, two protective dikes, and sluice gates built on the Black Gang dike, all of which have been completed one after another, etc. (October 20)</p>

<p>—Funds allocated first to Huaianing and other counties in Anhui Province for distribution—</p>
<p>Wuhu Correspondence: The Yangtze River floods this summer were most severe in Hubei Province, followed by Hunan, Jiangxi, Anhui, and other provinces. As autumn ends and winter approaches, the disaster victims are crying out in hunger and cold, suffering terribly. In addition to the Central Relief Commission and the provincial compatriots abroad who are doing their best to provide relief, the Shanghai General Office of the Southeast China Branches of the World Red Swastika Society is also working together to provide relief. According to the person in charge of the Wuhu Red Swastika Society, the General Office has dispatched Presidents Han Fuhang and Li Tianzhen to lead relief teams to set off to the flood-stricken areas of the Yangtze River provinces to conduct district-by-district inspections and distributions. They passed through Wuhu in the middle of this month and went to Hubei and Hunan provinces to work deep in the disaster areas. In order to gather strength to help the disaster victims, the office has also negotiated with the China International Famine Relief Commission and agreed to jointly organize Yangtze River relief efforts. The total amount of relief funds stipulated by the Red Swastika Society is 100,000 units, and 80,000 units have now been collected and handed over to the relief teams for distribution. For Anhui Province, a portion will be allocated first to Huaianing, Fanchang, Dangtu, and other counties where the disaster situation is more serious. The seven or eight counties with lighter disasters, such as Tongling and Guichi, will be allocated funds after the relief funds are fully raised. Within the province, the Anhui Central and Southern Joint Office of the Red Swastika Society moved from Anqing to Wuhu on the 22nd and was attached to the Red Swastika Branch in Jihe Street. The Society will convene representatives from various county branches to Wuhu to plan relief for disaster victims throughout the province. In addition, the China Relief Committee believes that the counties in this province have suffered from widespread floods and droughts, and that there are many disaster victims. Winter is approaching, and they lack the means to keep warm. It has specially allocated 90 bundles of donated clothing from the Capital Circles Disaster Relief Donation Committee, including single-layer and padded clothing, totaling 10,000 pieces, and telegraphed the provincial government to quickly send personnel to Beijing to collect them and transport them to the disaster areas for distribution. After receiving the telegram, the provincial government immediately forwarded it to the Provincial Disaster Area Relief Committee for verification, ordering them to send personnel to collect and transport the clothing to the disaster areas for distribution as soon as possible.

<h3 id="e83">Typhoon Disaster in Southern Guangdong Province <a href="#e83" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c83" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">83</a></h3>
<p>Haigang Dike Breached, Southern Suburbs Become a Watery Land; Beihai Civilian Aviation Airport Destroyed; Over a Hundred People Drowned in Ship Sinking at Haikou</p>
<p>Guangzhou Correspondence: The areas along the southern coast of Guangdong Province are prone to typhoons during the typhoon season. Therefore, local people experience typhoon disasters almost every year. In October last year, a major typhoon struck Haigang, Suixi, and other areas, causing surging tides that destroyed hundreds of acres of embankments, and gardens and houses were wiped out. The scars have not yet healed, but on the 8th of this month, a typhoon warning was issued again, and the damage was no less than last year. Since last month, the weather in Haigang County has been clear and the temperature has been high. However, on the evening of the 7th of this month, the weather suddenly changed, and a northwest wind brought torrential rain from the ocean. For a time, the wind roared on land, and the roofs of houses shook, as if ten thousand horses were galloping. Residents were awakened from their dreams, scrambling to repair leaks and close doors, in a state of great disarray. By 5:00 AM, the wind had become even stronger, and it continued to rage until the 8th, uprooting trees, sinking boats, and collapsing houses, resulting in a major disaster. The low-lying areas outside the county seat were flooded by rising tides, causing the embankments to collapse. The Naxi area became a vast expanse of water. Villages such as Muting Township, Mochen Village, Baishawei, Nanmen Market, and Beidiaohui outside the South Gate were submerged in the flood, with only the hilltops and treetops visible. Only one or two small boats were traveling back and forth. Near the southern suburbs, the water was four to five feet deep. It is reported that most of the embankments that had collapsed last year were washed away again. The new embankment in Muting Bay was completely washed away by the seawater, and all the late-season rice and miscellaneous grains were swept away. Refugees crowded into the city. The classrooms and dormitories of Leizhou Normal School and the County First Primary School were blown down by the wind. The Haigang County Magistrate Lin Zhende, in addition to telegrahping the township chiefs in the disaster areas to investigate the disaster situation, also telegraphed a report to the province yesterday, stating that the wind suddenly rose on the morning of the 8th, and the tide surged, causing breaches in many places along the north and south embankments, and the east and west oceans were flooded, with a disaster situation no less than last year. On the evening of the 7th, a hurricane struck Lianzhou and Beihai, and the wind became even stronger on the afternoon of the 8th. Trees and temporary buildings in the county seat were destroyed. The education office and auditorium of Lianzhou Middle School were also collapsed by the wind. All telephone lines from Lianzhou to Beihai, Hepu to Lingshan, and Hepu to Qinzhou were broken, and news was blocked. More than ten fishing boats sank on the Anpu sea surface, and cargo ships were capsized in front of the customs, resulting in deaths and the loss of tens of thousands of units worth of goods. The entire Beihai civil aviation airport collapsed, and countless other residents' houses were blown down. As for Qiongya, being isolated in the ocean, it also suffered from the typhoon. According to returning passengers, hurricanes occurred from the 7th to the 10th of this month in the Haikou area of Qiongzhou, especially on the 8th. Many houses were destroyed near Haikou, and crops were almost completely lost. Dozens of ships sank off the coast of Haikou, drowning over a hundred people. The disaster situation is extremely serious. (October 18)</p>
<h3 id="e84">Telephone Expert Committee: Summary of Telephone Report <a href="#e84" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c84" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">84</a></h3>
<p>Advocating a Uniform Pay-Per-Call System: Initial Costs Reduced for Business and Residential Telephones; Report Accompanied by Three Contributory Opinions: Long-Distance Calls in the Chinese Concession Should Be Improved Immediately</p>
<p>The telephone expert's report has been released. For the convenience of readers, the key suggestions in the report are listed below: (1) The Shanghai Telephone Company has fulfilled the provisions of Article 5 of the franchise contract and should enjoy the net profit of 8.2% on its business investment as stipulated in Article 13, Section 2 of the contract, and may start raising prices from April 1st. (2) All expenditures of the company regarding machinery, equipment, and other properties are reasonable, prudent, and not excessive. (3) The company's operating and maintenance expenses are generally economical and reasonable. However, the two items of general business in operating expenses are higher than those of other companies in the East. It is suggested that the company should further seek savings in expenditures, such as advertising and promotion costs, and employ more local technical talents in addition to top-level foreign personnel. (4) In order to reduce the burden on small users and increase the effectiveness of ordinary users, a pay-per-call system including a basic number of calls should be uniformly adopted for both business and residential users. (5) The most important proposal for telephone charges is: for business telephones, 150 calls per month for 10 yuan, with an additional charge of 3 fen per call; for residential telephones, 100 calls per month for 6 yuan 5 jiao, with an additional charge of 3 fen per call. (6) Opinions are given on the three issues of call charges for Chinese concessions, long-distance telephone connection methods, and telephone charges for roads outside the settlement.</p>
<p>The report on the issue of telephone rate increases by the Telephone Expert Committee of the Public Concession's Bureau of Works was formally signed by experts from China, Japan, Britain, and the United States the day before yesterday evening and submitted to the Board of Directors of the Bureau of Works yesterday. A general translation is made and urgently announced as follows:</p>
<p>The names of the experts are: Mr. Hu Ruixiang from China, Mr. Inada San-no-suke from Japan, Mr. Brown from Britain, and Mr. Ray from the United States.</p>
<p>The first section of the report first excerpts the scope of the Telephone Expert Committee's investigation of telephone affairs, as previously passed by the Board of Directors of the Public Concession (see the Bureau of Works Gazette of July 24 of this year), and declares that it will answer each item within the scope of the investigation in order. However, Section 3 of the scope assumes the continued maintenance of the current unlimited call subscription system and instructs the experts to draw up a price list, so it is proposed not to discuss it. In addition, Section 1 of the scope includes the following items:</p>
<p>(A) Does the Shanghai Telephone Company have the right to increase telephone charges from April 1935?</p>
<p>(B) Are the company's expenditures on machinery, equipment, and other properties economical?</p>
<p>(C) Are the company's existing operating and maintenance costs economical and reasonable?</p>
<p>Section 1 of the scope includes the following items:</p>
<p>(A) Is it appropriate to adopt a pay-per-call system for business telephones or residential telephones or both?</p>
<p>(B) If a pay-per-call system is considered appropriate, what kind of price list should be adopted so that the company can obtain the net profit stipulated in the franchise contract? The report also involves the origin of the franchise contract, because before the Shanghai Telephone Company obtained this franchise contract, there were three telephone companies competing fiercely for this right. Among them, the terms proposed by the International Telephong and Telegraoh Corporation (i.e., the parent company of the Shanghai Telephone Company) were the most favorable, so the Bureau of Works granted the franchise. The following are the answers to the questions within the scope of the experts' work:</p>
<p>Section 1 - A: From the perspectives of mechanical technology and economic management, in addition to the detailed opinions expressed elsewhere in this report, the Expert Committee believes that the company can fulfill the conditions of Article 5 of the franchise contract in a reasonable and pragmatic manner and should enjoy the benefits on the price list stipulated in Article 13, Section 2 of the franchise contract. The original text is: "After the completion of the installation of the automatic machine, the company may negotiate a price list with the Bureau of Works so that the company can obtain a net annual interest of 8.2% on its investment."</p>
<p>Section 1 - B: Regarding this issue, the experts first stated that what they always kept in mind when preparing the report was the so-called "Optimum Condition," which refers to the reasonable cost at which a certain supplier should be able to provide competent and surplus services. Regarding machinery, the report contains the following record: "All the machinery in Shanghai is modern in all aspects and can provide the best quality telephone supply, which is also the case in fact. We have also reviewed the company's records, and there are very few expressions of dissatisfaction with the supply. The company's service tests and obstruction reports are also sufficient to show the excellent supply of the company. Users who have been consulted also say that the existing telephone is far superior to that provided by the Huayang Telephone Company in 1930." The effectiveness and universality of this service can also be seen from the rapid expansion of business. The report contains a detailed description, and the experts further stated, "The company's entire machinery is planned for the current and projected future situation of Shanghai. When the business develops and expands in the future, the input of new capital will be extremely limited. If we consider the situation at the time of purchasing or constructing the entire machinery, the company's expenditures are all reasonable and necessary in our opinion and were made with prudence. Because at that time, the public had a great demand for better telephone supply, and the installation of machinery had to be as complete as possible to meet local needs and in accordance with the provisions of the franchise contract. Under severe penalties, the company had to complete the automatic machine change within two years, and the company was able to complete the regulation in 20 months, reducing 132 days compared to what was allowed in the franchise contract. This spirit of prompt handling has great value for users.</p>
<p>In terms of expenditure, as of July 30, 1935, the total investment in the company's machinery and property reached 42,294,000 yuan, but by the end of this year, it is expected to increase to 42,830,000 yuan. The telephone company should be able to obtain a net profit of 8.2% on its "capital investment" (CapitalInvestear, i.e., the business investment stipulated in the franchise contract). This profit capital was 34,836,000 yuan at the end of 1934. In addition, there are other investments of about 6,000,000 yuan or more that cannot enjoy the same net profit. This distinction is because among the company's total investment, there are several types of money invested in the right to operate the company's profits, such as the rolling stock of depreciation and the surplus obtained from financial scheduling in 1933.</p>
<p>The report states, "Between December 31, 1934, and July 31, 1935, although the company's investment has increased by 1,346,000 yuan, the profit capital has actually decreased by 690,000 yuan due to the repayment of debts. From this, it can be seen that although the company's total investment has increased to 42,294,000 yuan in the first seven months of this year, the profit capital has decreased from 34,836,000 yuan to 34,146,000 yuan. Some say that the company's machinery has been overbuilt and that there has been waste in terms of expenditure, but according to our investigation, this is not entirely the case. On the contrary, this expenditure was reasonable and necessary under the circumstances at the time. In addition, the total amount of expenditure during the company's replacement of automatic machines, about two years, reached 17,735,000 taels, exceeding more than double what was estimated in the An Sheng report. This may also be the source of the saying that expenditure was wasted, because according to An Sheng's estimate, only 8,000,000 taels were required."</p>
<p>Regarding the above, the experts have the following detailed explanation: When An Sheng drafted the estimate, the Huayang Telephone Company still existed, and there was no plan to organize a new company at that time. However, when the franchise contract of the new company was drafted, the various requirements that the new supply should have were stipulated in detail. At that time, the idea seemed to be "take the essence and use the vast, one effort for all." The old system has been overthrown, and the future needs of increasing day by day and month by month had to be prepared. This is the biggest reason why the actual expenditure of the current company and the estimate in the An Sheng report cannot be reconciled. Later, the price of gold soared and the value of taels plummeted, affecting 85% of the company's construction costs, so the company's expenditure became even greater. According to the experts' investigation, when An Sheng drafted the report, every 100 taels of Kuan yuan was equivalent to 61 yuan, 8 jiao, and 3 li, but in the construction process of the new company, the average price of 100 taels of Kuan yuan was only 33 yuan, 1 jiao, and 1 li, and even on July 31, 1930, it was only 37 yuan per 100 taels of Kuan yuan.</p>
<p>The experts further stated that at the end of 1934, the company's total investment in machinery, business, etc. was 40,948,125 yuan, which was divided into machinery transferred from the old company that is currently in use, valued at 11,580,000 yuan, and machinery installed by the new company after August 5, 1930, valued at 29,368,000 yuan. The experts discussed whether the major categories of the company's property were economical. First, regarding the external line installation, the experts felt that the expenditure was extremely reasonable and said that the company was based on sound engineering knowledge and economic application. All investments were reasonable and prudent, so the external line machinery was modern and excellent in all aspects. As for the telephone equipment, according to the experts' observations, it was also extremely fair. It was especially commendable to uniformly change the old-fashioned telephone equipment to automatic machines in a short period of time. "It is feared that there are not many places where it can be updated uniformly in such a wide range and in such a short period of time."</p>
<p>Next, on the impact of the number of calls on the equipment, the experts predicted that after any kind of limited system is adopted in the future, the number of calls will be greatly reduced. At that time, "the company will be able to postpone the investment expenditure of the new equipment, which is unavoidable under the current situation, and the excess transmitters in certain sub-stations can also be temporarily stored for future expansion. The effect of this delay in transmitter equipment is the equivalent saving of the cost of each line equipment. For the same reason, the maintenance cost of each line must also be reduced accordingly."</p>
<p>Regarding land and real estate, the numbers indicated by the company matched the land price at the time of August 1930, and the price of the houses was also fair and reasonable. The total amount of working equipment was extremely low among companies of the same scale. In Section 1, the experts stated that they had personally inspected the company's various sub-stations to see how the machinery was maintained. The result of this inspection led the experts to believe that the methods adopted by each station were the most modern and were the same as those adopted by the Bell System Telephone Company in the United States and the British Post Office. To prove the management methods of the world's major telephone businesses, the maintenance achievements of the telephone company in this port can be regarded as satisfactory, and the number of user difficulties recorded is also impeccable. In terms of internal difficulties at each station, the numbers are generally balanced. Only the central station has a larger number than other places due to the excessive number of calls, but the work of troubleshooting can still maintain a very high standard. The report further states, "Maintenance costs only account for a portion of the total operating expenses, because the operating expenses include the following various expenses, which are all paid by the Shanghai Telephone Company: (1) General, (2) Call, (3) Business, (4) Maintenance, (5) Depreciation, (6) Taxes. We deeply feel that operating expenses do need to be considered in the long term. We have compared the above-mentioned first four items with other telephone businesses, but because the situations in each place are different, or even cannot be compared, the comparison should also be made with extreme caution. However, in terms of bookkeeping methods, the methods of the American companies are roughly the same as those of the Shanghai Telephone Company, and the telephone organizations of Eastern countries are also mostly available for reference because of the similar living standards of the people. In the bookkeeping of the American Bell System companies, the costs of long-distance calls and local costs are combined, making it impossible to analyze them. In addition, the Honolulu Mutual Telephone Company is extremely similar to the Shanghai Telephone Company in terms of its business conditions and can be compared. However, the general and business expenses in all operating expenses of the Honolulu Company are extremely low, far from those of the Shanghai Company. From this, it can be seen that the expenses of the Shanghai Company seem to have the possibility of further tightening. For example, in the first half of this year, the advertising and promotion expenses spent on each telephone in the Shanghai Telephone Company reached 2 yuan and 1 jiao and 4 fen. Although we know that the economic depression of society has to be used for advertising and publicity to attract customers, it is especially important to be cautious about whether the gains and losses are commensurate. From another aspect, the total amount of cost spent on each telephone is the highest in the United States and the lowest in the East. This is due to the huge difference in the living standards of people in the East and the West, but the average total cost per telephone of the Shanghai Telephone Company, after deducting management expenses last year, still reached 46 yuan and 2 jiao, which is the highest among the telephone businesses in the adjacent cities of China and Japan. In addition, among the employees of the Shanghai Telephone Company, the number of foreign personnel with extremely high salaries is very large. Although the company is operated by foreign capital, the highest positions have to be held by foreigners, but there are still many positions under senior officials that are irrelevant to the power of affairs, and it is the company's own policy to attract local talents in the same position. Therefore, in the future, when personnel with considerable training and technical expertise can be hired locally, the company should implement this policy as much as possible. "</p>
<p>In addition, the experts believe that the depreciation calculation method adopted by the telephone company, that is, 4.5% of the total assets of the company are depreciated each year, is still considered reasonable and suggests that this calculation should continue until there are other instructions in the future experience.</p>
<p>Section 2, A: According to the experts, there are currently about three types of telephone charging systems in general use, namely subscription (or unlimited call method), tiered counting, and pay-per-call. The experts have a detailed discussion on the advantages and disadvantages of the above three methods, but they believe that the subscription method is only suitable for smaller telephone systems. As for the breadth of Shanghai, the large population, and whether the service is considerate, it depends on the widespread installation of sub-stations, and the subscription system is no longer suitable. According to the experts, the universal price of unlimited supply is based on the average application of all large and small users. The result of this universal average price is that small users are discouraged and large users are used as much as possible. However, the abuse of large users not only damages the function of their own telephones, but also hinders other users who want to talk to them. The so-called "busy line" is because it is busy, so external calls cannot be connected, and those who talk to it regard it as "equal to closing the door" because they cannot answer many times, or they have to switch to other homes after a few calls. Therefore, merchants who often have busy lines invisibly lose many customers, but there are also considerable losses if the telephone cannot be connected many times. The cost is actually shared by all users, large and small, and the public suffers the loss. "</p>
<p>In Shanghai, as a result of adopting the unlimited call subscription method, all the disadvantages have been pointed out one by one in the expert report, and it is said that in addition to the users who are careless and abuse them at will, there are also those who install residential telephones for business purposes, and the company has presented a lot of evidence. The experts said, "In view of the widespread installation of merchants in this port, it will not help to cancel the pay-per-call system for commercial telephones only, because after such a change, all calls originally made on commercial telephones can be carried out on residential telephones that are charged on a subscription basis. It is also useless to allow users to freely choose the charging method, and after repeated trials in other places, large users will continue to adopt the unlimited subscription system, while small users will adopt limited numbers or pay-per-call methods, because large and small users each choose the method that is beneficial to themselves. " The experts further stated that because the supply of telephones can be abused at will, the number of user calls increased by a factor of one between 1930 and 1934, and the company's capital and operating expenses also increased sharply as a result. "All these extra expenses, which are caused by the extremely high number of calls, must be borne by each user, regardless of its size, on average. Therefore, if this universal and uniform charging method is not changed for a long time, the disadvantages for small users will increase day by day. Now, in order to remedy this, we deeply feel that there is no better way than to adopt a new charging system that makes the price paid for the supply somewhat related to the actual use. "</p>
<p>The experts further stated, "The stage counting method may be used as a transitional method from the subscription system to the pay-per-call system, but the stage counting method also has its shortcomings, and the price of the call often varies by several yuan due to the number of calls. Therefore, this system is absolutely unacceptable and very few people adopt it. Therefore, our conclusion is that the pay-per-call system, which includes the number of calls in the basic stage, is the most suitable method. All users in Shanghai, whether they are businesses or residences, should uniformly adopt it. "Our proposal is that users in Shanghai, whether they are businesses or residences, should uniformly adopt the pay-per-call method based on the price of the supply, because we firmly believe that this method is the most beneficial to society."</p>
<h2>Page 10</h2>
<p>Section 2, B: Regarding the matter of setting prices so that the Shanghai Telephone Company can enjoy a net profit of 8.2% on its profit investment, the experts considered several other matters before making a decision. The first point is about the impact on the number of calls after adopting any pay-per-call method. The telephone company has agreed to a reduction of 37.5%. The experts believe that this point is reasonable. Therefore, their conclusion is that adopting the pay-per-call system, including the number of calls in the first stage in a certain basic call fee, and reducing the charge for each additional call is the most practical method at present. The experts then proceeded to calculate the necessary prices so that the pay-per-call method could generate the desired benefits and find the percentage of its interest, but one item was reserved, which was that US government income tax, general management fees, and annual depreciation of 150,000 yuan were not included in the calculation. If these expenses can be spent by the company under the business item in the future, there will be a reduction of nearly 2% in net profit. According to this calculation, what the experts believe is necessary is that commercial telephones should be priced at 11 yuan per month for 150 calls in the basic stage, and residential telephones should be priced at 7 yuan per month for 100 calls in the basic stage. In addition, whether it is commercial or residential, a fee of 3 fen will be charged for each additional call. However, the experts deeply feel that the Shanghai Telephone Company should be willing to accept a slightly lower item, so that the economic depression will ease slightly in the future, or even if the ministry disappears, the company's profits will not exceed what it deserves, which will lead to the need for another investigation to seek a further reduction in the company's income. Therefore, the experts prepared another price list, which can obtain a net profit of 8.54% in the initial implementation. It is hoped that the company can temporarily accept this method, that is, commercial telephones are 10 yuan per month, which can make 150 calls, with an additional charge of 3 fen per call, and sub-lines are 5 yuan per month. Residential telephones are 6 yuan and 5 jiao per month, which can make 100 calls, with an additional charge of 3 fen per call. In addition, the telephones that have already implemented the pay-per-call system will be calculated in the same way as other commercial telephones, that is, 10 yuan per month to make 150 calls.</p>
<p>The report further stated, "When drafting the price list, it was necessary to reduce the number of calls by 37.5%, but if the number of reductions exceeds this estimate, the company's profits will not be able to obtain the expected number. However, considering various situations, we deeply feel that there is no way to obtain a closer calculation than this. We have also used the experience of telephone businesses in other places that have changed from the subscription system to the pay-per-call system as a reference. We also know that the current number of calls is extremely high, and the decline in the number of calls after the implementation of the new system will inevitably be greater than the original number of calls. Furthermore, it is extremely obvious that the call fees paid by small users in the current price list will be lower than what they pay now. According to our records, if the telephone prices before April 1 of this year are used, then 47% of residential users and 41% of commercial telephones will pay lower call fees in the future. If the current temporary price increase is used, then 59% of residential users and 50% of commercial telephones will be able to save on call fees in the future. From this, it can be seen that after the implementation of the pay-per-call system, the call fees will not generally increase as rumored by the outside world. "</p>
<p>As for other items in the price list, the experts also intend to modify them. The modified prices include the following items:</p>
<p>Each rotary telephone will be charged an additional monthly fee of 5 jiao, which was originally set at 1 yuan and 4 jiao and 7 fen. The installation fee was originally set at 13 yuan, 9 jiao, and 9 fen, and is now set at 10 yuan. Sub-lines and indoor sub-machines were originally set at 2 yuan, 1 jiao, and 9 fen, and are now uniformly 1 yuan. The reconnection fee was originally set at 2 yuan and 8 jiao, and is now set at 2 yuan.</p>
<p>The above items are all lower than the original prices. In addition, there are</p>
<p>Private lines, patch cords, sub-lines, etc., which were originally calculated by line. It is stipulated that each half air mile, or less than half air mile, is 12 yuan per line. If it exceeds half air mile, an additional 1 yuan will be charged for every tenth of a mile, or its remainder. The telephone is 1 yuan per unit.</p>
<p>The monthly rental fee for private switchboards was originally 1 yuan, 6 jiao, and 3 fen for 10 lines, 3 yuan and 5 jiao for 15 lines, 7 yuan and 3 jiao for 25 lines, 9 yuan, 4 jiao, and 9 fen for 36 lines, 10 yuan, 9 jiao, and 3 fen for 47 lines, and 12 yuan and 4 jiao for 58 lines. The current rental fee is 5 yuan for 10 lines, 7 yuan for 15 lines, 10 yuan for 25 lines, 12 yuan for 36 lines, 14 yuan for 47 lines, and 16 yuan for 58 lines.</p>
<p>The above special line prices are greatly reduced compared to the prices proposed by the telephone company in January of this year. Those who rent private lines can get direct and agile private calls, and the telephone company has no other income besides the rental fee. Otherwise, if the special line does not exist, the user's calls must pass through the company's sub-station. If there are many things, installing one more line has appropriate income, so when setting the price of this special line, the supply obtained by the tenant has to be taken into account. The rental fee for private switchboards has been slightly increased, but the company has suffered great losses under this item. This small increase can slightly reduce the company's losses. Furthermore, the additional price of the rotary telephone has been reduced by almost two-thirds, and the sub-line sub-machine has been reduced</p>
<p>More than one-half. Therefore, the increase in the rental fee of this switchboard is not a concern. "</p>
<p>The report concluded, "We deeply hope that the Shanghai Telephone Company can accept the above items. When the profits are insufficient in the future, it can be re-discussed in accordance with Article 14 of the franchise contract."</p>
<p>The above is a summary of all the answers to the matters investigated within the scope of the telephone experts' powers. In addition, there are several important issues that are closely related to the telephone business in this port, but are not within the scope of the investigation. The experts have the following opinions:</p>
<p>The experts said, in addition, there are several matters that are not within the scope of our investigation. We would like to express our opinions as follows in view of the earnest expectations of all parties:</p>
<p>The call fee question is a troubling issue of call fees between users of the Shanghai Telephone Company and the Chinese Telephone Bureau. We have no precedent to refer to for telephone systems operated by the two authorities, between which users can make free calls without paying. However, under the existing method, users in one system must report their numbers for the purpose of recording before the call is connected. Therefore, all kinds of malpractices and fraudulent abuses are obvious to everyone. Users often have to pay call fees for others without making a call, which is extremely unfair. This malpractice can be avoided if direct dialing can be carried out between the two systems.</p>
<p>The long-distance telephone connection problem - China's long-distance telephone is operated by the Chinese government. When users in adjacent areas want to make long-distance calls, the call must first be connected to the manual switchboard of the telephone company's central station, where the switchboard operator asks the original caller for their telephone number and the telephone number to be connected. After the switchboard operator records both numbers, they dial to the Zhabei long-distance telephone office, where the Chinese Telephone Bureau switchboard operator also asks for the telephone numbers of both parties in the same way, and then connects the call. This procedure is extremely cumbersome and repetitive. If the local and long-distance telephones are affiliated with the same authority, only one station is needed, and there is no need for two stations. Technically speaking, setting up one more station is adding to the trouble, and because of this additional station, the sound has been greatly reduced during long-distance calls, and there are many obstacles and delays in machinery and work. In terms of time, it is also extremely uneconomical, so this redundant station is like adding five wheels to a car, which is counterproductive.</p>
<p>The Chinese authorities have no separate long-distance telephone stations in the Public Concession. The obvious reason is that since the franchise for business in the concession has been granted to the Shanghai Telephone Company, if the Telephone Bureau sets up a sub-station in the concession, it may be related to the company's sovereignty. However, on the other hand, for the sake of service and verification, the Shanghai Telephone Company does not allow its users to directly connect to the Telephone Bureau's long-distance line, and the company's personnel record the number of calls. Therefore, in case of difficulties, the person responsible to the user is not the Chinese Telephone Bureau, but the Shanghai Telephone Company. From this, it can be seen that this inappropriate method of setting up stations by both parties to handle long-distance calls will continue to exist if the company and the Telephone Bureau do not yield to each other. Technically speaking, the long-distance telephone line should be as close to the user as possible, which means that the Chinese Telephone Bureau's line should end at the Shanghai Telephone Company's long-distance telephone switchboard. If this method cannot be established, then in our opinion, the most appropriate method is to allow users in the concession to directly call and connect with the Zhabei long-distance telephone station, and the telephone company can send accounting personnel to the station to record the number of calls to show credibility. Either of these two methods can save costs and make the sound clearer during calls, because the number of connection points has been reduced by one. Therefore, we advocate that the telephone authorities of both parties should consider this matter deeply, find a way to reach an understanding, and seek to eliminate the existing bad methods.</p>
<p>"The telephone question of building roads outside the boundary is that the price paid by telephone users in the area of building roads outside the boundary seems to be sufficient to limit the development of the telephone business to residents who have to install telephones. Naturally, the blame for this situation does not lie with the Shanghai Telephone Company, because the call fees charged by the company are the same as those of users in the concession. As for the collection of additional fees, the company not only has no profit to gain, but also has to collect and pay on behalf of others, which is cumbersome and full of complaints. Taking the North District as an example, the Chinese Telephone Bureau in that area could have provided telephones, but the additional fees must be collected by the Telephone Company on behalf of the Chinese Telephone Bureau as a tax for the Chinese Telephone Bureau's abandonment of telephone rights. Since the Chinese Telephone Bureau allows users to install concession telephones, users can save 5 fen per call. This issue is still under negotiation between China and foreign countries, so for the time being, we will not give a detailed discussion on this complicated issue, but what we want to say is that the people in the area of building roads outside the boundary have heard a lot of complaints about the heavy burden.</p>
<h3 id="e85">Qingdao Business Circle Organizes Fruit Production Company <a href="#e85" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c85" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">85</a></h3>
<p>—To Establish a Model Orchard—</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: The local geology and climate are quite suitable for fruit production. Unfortunately, farmers adhere to old methods and do not know how to improve, resulting in poor quality products and limited sales. Prominent figures and capitalists in the city, in order to develop the local fruit industry, have organized the Qingdao Fruit Production Co., Ltd. to engage in the planting of fruits and vegetables, storage, and transportation. The capital is set at 60,000 yuan, fully subscribed by the promoters, and has been paid in full and deposited in the Shanghai Bank. The promoters have already submitted an application to the Social Affairs Bureau for registration and forwarded it to the Ministry of Industry for registration. The document submitted to the Social Affairs Bureau states, "Submitting an application for the registration of Qingdao Fruit Production Co., Ltd., organized by fundraising, in order to develop the local fruit industry and assist rural construction, in accordance with the provisions of the Company Law for limited liability companies. We have raised funds to organize Qingdao Fruit Production Co., Ltd., to engage in the business of planting fruits and vegetables, storage, transportation, and processing and manufacturing of ancillary matters. The total capital is provisionally set at 60,000 yuan in national currency, divided into 600 shares, each share at 300 yuan, fully subscribed by the promoters. A temporary office is located in the Bank of Communications Building on Zhongshan Road in this city. A list of promoters is prepared and submitted to your office for review. We humbly request approval for registration. The promoters are Peng Dongyuan, Deng Yiguang, Ye Zigang, Qi Yunzhi, Xi Dongsheng, Sun Zhenwu, Zhou Zhijun, Lin Fengqi, Yi Yongfang, Ge Mengyu, Ouyang Hong, Lu Wenfeng, Gu Dingfu, Yao Shenba, Wu Tuian, Cheng Jingzhi, Song Qiangming, Zhou Yanjing." Furthermore, the company's proposed plan is as follows: "The Qingdao geology and climate are particularly suitable for fruit production. Currently, peaches, plums, apples, grapes, and other varieties are already showing some success in Qingdao. Unfortunately, farmers adhere to old methods and do not know how to improve. If varieties are not selected and pests cannot be eliminated, the resulting products will be poor and sales will be limited. In view of this, the company will first engage in establishing a model orchard to cultivate, improve varieties, and apply scientific cultivation methods simultaneously. At the same time, we will plant both Chinese and Western vegetables to promote rural production. We will also establish storage warehouses to preserve large quantities of fruit produced using scientific methods, so that they can be distributed leisurely in domestic and foreign markets without being affected by weather or human factors. Before the model orchard of the company produces fruit, we plan to first engage in transportation and sales, both to promote the existing fruit production of the city, improve the livelihood of farmers, and to study transportation methods to seek commercial rationality. Therefore, transportation and sales are also one of the company's main research and improvement tasks. As for establishing factories to manufacture canned goods and brew wine, these will be carried out in order depending on the future management effectiveness and environmental needs, in order to enrich people's lives, so that everyone can taste both sheep dates and sorrowful pears, and fine wines can be obtained without seeking them from outside. The development of fruit production in the city and the recovery of rural resources will depend on this."</p>

<p>Execution by Shooting of a Repeat Barbiturate Injection Offender</p>
<p>Shi Fenglou, a resident of the Eighth District Central Township, had a long-standing barbiturate injection habit. He was previously detained and ordered to undergo rehabilitation and released on bond. However, after his release, he continued to inject. The Public Security Bureau investigated and brought him to the county, ordering him to be examined by the smoking cessation center. It was reported that the offender was indeed a repeat offender with an addiction. He was then sent to the Zhenjiang Garrison Command for interrogation. A telegram was received from the province sentencing the offender to death, approved by Chairman Chiang, and ordered to be brought back for execution. The county government ordered Mou Yizhi, the leader of the water patrol team, to go to the province to bring him back. The county government, seeing that there were many drug dealers and injection offenders in the Eighth District, ordered the Public Security Bureau team to escort the offender to Datuan Town in that district on the 21st for execution by shooting as a deterrent. At the same time, the county party headquarters and the county government sent several personnel to promote drug prohibition in order to draw the attention of the general public.</p>
<p>Songjiang</p>
<p>County Magistrate Investigates Smoking and a Smoker Resists with Violence</p>
<p>After the new county magistrate, Li Leng, arrived in Songjiang, he devoted himself to improving the Baojia system and prohibiting smoking. Li went to various sales and smoking locations himself to conduct inspections. On the morning of the 23rd, in Shouji's sales and smoking location on Changqiao Street, he discovered Wang Yunhai smoking without a license. He ordered the clerk of the location to guard him and wait for the police to take him into custody. Unexpectedly, Wang Yunhai suddenly attacked Li and escaped during the commotion. The county government has now summoned the owner of the location to turn over the escaped Wang Yunhai for interrogation. The clerk, A Gen, has already been summoned. The county's smoking prohibition committee was previously reorganized by order of the province and is no longer under the smoking prohibition section. The former county magistrate selected Wang Zhewu, Cai Zhongyu, Sun Shiheng, Lu Shushu, Li Zufu, Li Xiuzhe, and Zhou Zhanqi, seven people, as members of the county's smoking prohibition committee, and submitted them to the provincial smoking prohibition committee for approval.

<p>Changshu</p>
<p>Agricultural Bank Manager Embezzles Funds and Flees</p>
<p>The Farmers Bank on County South Street in this county was the first branch established by the Jiangsu Province. Chen Herong from Suzhou was appointed by the province as the bank manager. He has been in office for five or six years. The business has developed and is highly regarded by the province. Unfortunately, Chen had extensive social connections in Changshu, resulting in significant losses to the bank's funds over the years. Unable to make up for the losses, Chen absconded with over 80,000 yuan. The deputy manager of the bank noticed this and reported it to the province for instructions. The head office was extremely angry. On one hand, it ordered Chen to be wanted. On the other hand, it appointed Li Huihua to come to Changshu to succeed as bank manager. Li arrived in Changshu on the 22nd to take office. It is also learned that Wang Cainan, the treasury director of the Suzhou branch, also had a similar incident.

The court declared the debate on the assault on the police in front of Yichangyong concluded and awaiting sentencing. Regarding the assault on the police in front of Jiading Bank, because there was an auxiliary policeman named Chen Zhixiang who was not examined at the time, but recently died suddenly in a Shanghai hospital, it is necessary to inquire with the hospital for proof of the cause of death to determine whether it was related to the injury before further investigation. Fu Mengxian, Qian Xiaoci, Zhai Yonghua, Zhang Shunhua, and Zhao Baozhang were still released on their original bail. Li Xuefu, Shen Yuzhen, Wang Fuquan, and Zhang Zhongyun were remanded in custody.</p>

<h3 id="e86">Shanghai Boy Scouts Hold General Mobilization for Flood Relief Fundraising - Decision Made to Hold External and Internal Fundraising Days Starting November 9th <a href="#e86" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c86" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">86</a></h3>
<p>This year's floods have affected the Huaihe and Han rivers successively, and the disaster is even more severe than in the Republic of China Year 20. The disaster area covers more than a dozen provinces, with tens of millions of victims, displaced and suffering unspeakable hardships. People from all walks of life have been donating money and efforts to help, but even with these efforts they are like a drop in the bucket. The Shanghai Provincial Flood Relief Association believes that the disaster is so severe that relief cannot be delayed. In addition to appealing to all parties for donations, various entertainment activities have been held one after another, with all proceeds going to relief. Yesterday, a general mobilization of the city's Boy Scouts was launched for fundraising. It is now learned that the plan has been finalized to mobilize the Boy Scouts to raise funds from November 9th to the 17th. The 9th and 10th will be the Boy Scouts' external fundraising days, and the 11th to 17th will be the internal fundraising days. At that time, the Huaren and Zujie authorities will be requested to assist. The following is the implementation plan for the Shanghai Boy Scouts' General Mobilization for Flood Relief Fundraising in various provinces: (1) The Shanghai Municipal Council of the Chinese Boy Scouts is ordered by the General Association of Chinese Boy Scouts and requested by the Shanghai Flood Relief Association to organize a general mobilization for flood relief fundraising in various provinces. (2) The preparatory work for the city's Boy Scouts' general mobilization for fundraising will be jointly handled by the personnel appointed by the Council and the Flood Relief Association. (3) The date for the city's Boy Scouts' general mobilization for fundraising is set from November 9th to the 17th, a total of nine days. The 9th and 10th will be the Boy Scouts' external fundraising days, and the 11th to 17th will be the internal fundraising days. (4) On the Boy Scouts' external fundraising days, donations can be solicited from residences, shops, foreign firms, institutions, hotels, amusement grounds, etc. within the areas designated by the Council from 8:00 am to 10:00 pm daily (but absolutely avoid soliciting donations along the road). (5) On the Boy Scouts' internal fundraising days, donations can be solicited from relatives and friends by the Boy Scouts at their leisure after work. (6) Boy Scouts participating in external fundraising will be granted leave by the Council on behalf of the schools or service agencies. (7) Donation tickets are divided into four types: one jiao, two jiao, one yuan in silver dollars, and two jiao and four jiao in small silver coins, printed by the Flood Relief Association and distributed by the Council for use. (8) Before and after the Boy Scouts' General Mobilization for Flood Relief Fundraising, propaganda should be carried out as much as possible to awaken the public and facilitate the fundraising. The methods include news advertising, leaflets, etc., which will be handled by the Flood Relief Association and the Council. (9) On the day of the Boy Scouts' external fundraising general mobilization, the Flood Relief Association will contact the municipal government and the authorities of the Public and French Concessions in advance to arrange for traffic and protection to facilitate the operation. (10) A commemorative badge will be issued to each group and Boy Scout participating in the fundraising, and special rewards will be given to those with excellent results (the reward method will be formulated separately by the Council). (11) During the Council's external fundraising, a temporary office will be set up at the Eight Immortals Bridge Youth Association to facilitate contact with the participating Boy Scouts. (12) The donations collected by each Boy Scout group will be handed over to the Council for remittance to the Flood Relief Association at any time.</p>
<h3 id="e87">Social Affairs Bureau Strictly Prohibits the Use of Sun Yat-Sen’s Name or Portrait on Trademarks <a href="#e87" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c87" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">87</a></h3>
<p>And Requires That Trademarks for National Products Must Not Be Entirely in Foreign Languages</p>
<p>Regarding the prohibition of using Sun Yat-Sen’s name or portrait on trademarks and the requirement that trademarks for national products must not be entirely in foreign languages, the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau previously received an order from the Ministry of Industry to correct and strictly prohibit this. The Social Affairs Bureau has published a notice in the newspaper, requiring all merchants to correct this by the end of June of this year, otherwise, they will be severely punished if found or reported. Now, the Ministry of Industry has three interpretations regarding the prohibition of using Sun Yat-Sen's name or portrait on trademarks: (A) Those who violate the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law, even if they have been registered, should be revoked. (B) If there are certificates obtained with the consent of Sun Yat-Sen during his lifetime, they can be approved for registration and use in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 8 of the Trademark Law. (C) The two characters "Zhongshan" are already used as place names, but since they are Sun Yat-Sen's alias, they shall not be used as trademarks in accordance with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law. It is also heard that the Sun Yat-Sen portrait Zhongshan brand trademark previously approved for registration by the Shanghai Daming Glasses Company was determined by the Ministry of Industry to be in conflict with the provisions of Article 2, Paragraph 2 of the Trademark Law. In order to respect Sun Yat-Sen's portrait and abide by the law, the Ministry ordered the Trademark Bureau to revoke this registration. It is also learned that the Shanghai Social Affairs Bureau is currently sending personnel to investigate and solicit reports of whether anyone is still using Sun Yat-Sen's name or portrait as a trademark, and whether national products are entirely labeled in foreign languages. Those who dare to deliberately violate the rules will be severely punished.</p>

<p>More Than Forty Proposals Approved in Three Sessions</p>
<p>The Joint Water, Land, and Air Transport Conference for the Jinghu (Beijing-Shanghai), Huhang (Shanghai-Hangzhou), and Huhangyong (Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo) railway lines concluded yesterday at 4:30 PM after holding three sessions and approving over forty proposals related to train schedules, freight rates, and other matters. Deputy Director of the Railway Bureau, Wu Shaozeng, attended the closing ceremony to express his gratitude, and representatives from various related parties were present. The atmosphere was warm with enthusiasm for discussing transport matters. The details of the conference and the resolutions are recorded below:</p>
<p>Three Sessions</p>
<p>The joint conference held three sessions. The first session took place at 2:00 PM the day before yesterday, with forty-one representatives attending. Xiao Weiguo chaired the session, and Tang Xiongjie served as the recorder. Ten proposals related to train schedules and freight rates were approved before the meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM. The second session was held at 9:00 AM yesterday, where twenty-one similar miscellaneous proposals were resolved. The third session began at 2:00 PM in the afternoon, where ten miscellaneous and temporary proposals were approved. After the meeting, Deputy Director of the Railway Bureau, Wu Shaozeng, attended and delivered a speech, stating that the bureau convened the meeting to promote joint transport along the lines and expressed his gratitude to the representatives for attending, sharing their opinions, and jointly strategizing. He hoped that all related parties would earnestly assist the bureau in implementing the resolutions to complete the joint transport undertaking.</p>
<p>Train Schedule Proposals</p>
<p>The two railway lines held a joint water, land, and air transport conference, totaling three sessions, with over forty proposals. These were categorized into four groups: "A. Train Schedules," B. Freight Rates," C. Miscellaneous," and "D. Temporary Motions." (A) Train Schedules: (1) Proposal to increase stops for boarding and alighting on both up and down trains. Resolution: The railway bureau will carefully consider this when changing train schedules. (2) Proposal to add fourth-class carriages to scheduled trains. Resolution: The railway bureau will appropriately allocate vehicles after considering increasing the number of carriages. (3) The three companies jointly operating transport between Xinchang, Shengxian stations and the Shanghai North and South stations have reduced ticket prices, originally hoping to attract passengers, but have not seen any improvement. It is proposed to change the Shanghai-Hangzhou fourth-class train to depart Shanghai at 11:00 AM and arrive in Hangzhou at 3:00 PM, and also offer discounts on fourth-class tickets to recover joint ticket sales. Resolution: (1) The proposal to change the fourth-class train schedule is approved in principle. The railway bureau will comprehensively consider all aspects and make appropriate modifications when changing train schedules to meet the needs. (2) The issue of reducing ticket prices should be discussed under the category of freight rates. (4) Proposal to change the schedule of the 74th Shanghai-Changzhou and 73rd Changzhou-Shanghai third and fourth-class trains to benefit passengers. Resolution: The railway bureau has already reviewed and revised the schedule of the 73rd local train, which is largely consistent with the proposal, so no further discussion is needed. As for the schedules of the 74th and 72nd trains, a comprehensive consideration of all aspects is necessary, so no changes will be made for the time being. (5) Proposal to compile and print a joint transport timetable. Resolution: Approved. A booklet and a single sheet should be printed, including information on the mileage and fares of various highways and ships, as well as travel tips, to benefit travelers. The required expenses, excluding advertising revenue, should be distributed according to the number of each department's needs.</p>
<p>Freight Rate Proposals</p>

<p>To Help Fishermen in Various Coastal Areas</p>
<p>After the completion of various buildings, docks, and folk straw sheds in the Shanghai Fish Market of the Ministry of Industry, it will start operating in the middle of next month, and an opening ceremony will be held on a regular basis. The winter fishing season will begin next month, and during this period, there will be a lot of fish production along the coast of Jiangsu and Zhejiang. However, according to news from the fishing industry, fishermen in the coastal areas of Zhejiang usually have to borrow money from ice-fresh fish ships to go fishing and sell their fish to fish transport ships and sell them wholesale in Shanghai. In recent years, due to the general economic downturn, bank loans have decreased, and some fishermen have not been able to go fishing, resulting in a sharp decrease in production, which has had a significant impact on the economy of the people in various coastal areas of Zhejiang. Therefore, Zhejiang Province is negotiating with banks for a loan of 500,000 yuan to provide relief. At the same time, the Fish Market will also negotiate with the banking sector for ice-fresh fish transport to transfer loans to various fishermen.</p>

<p>The election of two directors of the Rickshaw Pullers Mutual Aid Association, representing the rickshaw pullers, will be held this afternoon (Thursday) in accordance with the regulations of the board of directors of the Mutual Aid Association and the constitution approved by the Board of Directors of the Public Concession. Previously, on the 11th of this month, the 400 rickshaw puller electors were drawn at the Mutual Aid Association Headquarters on Dongjiaxing Road under the supervision of Mr. Yu Qiaqing of the Public Concession, Mr. Jin Runxiang, representative of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and Mr. Yan Chengde, representative of the Chinese Taxpayers Association. All 400 of these electors have been notified by special letter of the election location and date, and the names and license numbers of the drawn electors have been published in Chinese newspapers for public knowledge. Today is the date of the election, and for the sake of prudence, Mr. Yao Zengmu, Deputy Chief Inspector of the Chinese Police Department of the Public Concession, has been specially invited to be the general supervisor. In addition, the only people who can participate in today's election ceremony are the following three types: (1) 400 rickshaw puller electors, all of whom must pass the inspection of their license armbands to enter the venue; (2) Directors of the Public Concession, members of the Mutual Aid Association's custodian committee, directors of the board of directors, and permanent staff; (3) Journalists. The patrol room will send detectives to maintain order at the time. At the time of the election, under the supervision of the general supervisor, the names and license numbers of the electors who have arrived will be written on the blackboard. The number of electors is stipulated to be at least 25 (the election will not be held if the number is insufficient). After the number is sufficient, the general supervisor will announce (1) the purpose of the election, (2) the position of director is an honorary position with no salary, (3) the election procedure is absolutely free. All registered rickshaw pullers have the right to be elected. Before the electors start the election, they can first propose the names and license numbers of the candidates. The names and license numbers of these candidates will be written on a blackboard, which is different from the blackboard on which the names and numbers of the electors are written, and it will be placed where everyone present can see it. When the number of candidates nominated reaches a considerable level, the general supervisor will announce the end of the nomination, and then each elector will vote in turn, selecting two of the candidates. This election ticket will be recorded on the blackboard by the general supervisor or his representative until all the electors have finished voting. Then, the general supervisor will count the votes and announce the two candidates with the most votes as the elected directors. If the number of votes is equal, the matter will be decided by a show of hands. The general supervisor has the right to make appropriate changes to the above methods when necessary.</p>

<p>Qibao is a large town in western Shanghai, and electricity and telephones have been connected to this port. However, transportation between Shanghai and Qibao has always relied on steamships and rickshaws. The terminal of the British merchant Hongqiao Road public bus is still four miles away from the town. The municipal and county authorities believe that the population of the town is increasing, and more and more people from all walks of life are going to invest in real estate and businesses every year, and it is urgent to actively develop it. Now that Qinggang Road Dongxi has been built, the local gentry plans to build a branch road from Qibao Town, connecting Qinggang Road Hongqiao Road, directly to the concession, which has been approved by the competent authorities and is scheduled to start construction on November 1. It is reported that after the completion of the project, the Shanghai-Qibao public bus will be opened. It will only take 25 minutes from Qibao to the center of the concession, and there will be more than 20 round trips every day. The transportation will be more convenient.</p>
<h3 id="e100">Continued Hearing of the Major Post Office Robbery Case; Li Yi-sheng and Li Xue-shi Granted Bail, Others Remanded in Custody Awaiting Next Wednesday's Hearing <a href="#e100" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c100" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">100</a></h3>
<p>On the morning of September 9th, the Shanghai General Post Office was suddenly invaded by a gang of audacious robbers who made off with over 91,000 yuan in cash and banknotes. The security guards escorting the large sum, Lü Rui-lin, and the old clerk Yuan Bing-shu, were shot and killed, while Zhou Yu-chen was wounded by gunfire. Subsequently, the police successively apprehended over a dozen suspects. After investigation, those not implicated were released, while Ji Ren-tang (also known as the Monk Wu Kong), a man from Funing, and one woman, were prosecuted by the police according to the law and handed over to the First Special District Court for investigation. This newspaper has repeatedly reported on the matter. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Jiang Shu-zi opened the court again, ordering the defendants Ji Ren-tang, Qiu Guo-bin, Li Yi-sheng, Li Xue-shi, Wu Pan-gui, Zhou Yao-shi, Liu Dao-sheng, Ji Wen-bin, Wang Chen-shi, Ji Chen-shi, and Chen Qiu-shi to be brought before the court.</p>
<p>In the continued hearing, the first witness, a Mr. Xu, was summoned. He was questioned about the cotton quilt seized by the police on a certain steamer when Wang Chen-shi and others were apprehended. Xu stated that he could not determine whether it belonged to his wife. Subsequently, Officer No. 5910 from the Municipal Public Security Bureau, who was on duty at the post office, was brought to the stand and questioned about his time on duty at the post office on the night of September 8th and on September 9th. Following this, the Western Detective Chief from the Disraeli Road Police Station reported on the investigation into Wang Chen-shi's deposit of 1,000 yuan at the Jin Cheng Bank. Furthermore, Yang Bing-qi, the director of the Revenue and Expenditure Department of the General Post Office, testified that the banknotes stolen from the bureau that day were all mixed denominations. Therefore, even if</p>
<p>stolen money was found on the defendants, it would be impossible to identify it as the original loot. In court, defendant Ji Ren-tang was interrogated. He confessed that he had previously been sentenced to one year and three months of imprisonment for arms trafficking. He was released in October of the year before last and then became acquainted with Wang Chen-shi, with whom he cohabitated at No. 327, Siwenli, Datong Road. Ji Chen-shi was his aunt. The court then presented the confession the suspect had made when arrested in Funing and after being brought to the police station, detailing how he and his accomplices planned the robbery beforehand, and how Liu Xiao-si and Li San opened fire during the robbery, while he seized the hemp sack containing banknotes that the old clerk was carrying, escaping with the loot to the home of a Mr. Liu on Yucai Road in Zhabei for distribution. Unexpectedly, most of the stolen money was</p>
<p>stolen and fled with by Li San, with him and Liu Xiao-si only receiving small amounts that were given to his concubine Chen-shi, and distributed to Qiu Guo-bin and Ji Chen-shi, each receiving several hundred yuan. The next day, he and Liu Xiao-si fled back to Funing. These statements were presented to him for confirmation, but the defendant completely denied them, firmly asserting that he had nothing to do with the robbery and was unaware of it. He claimed that Ji Chen-shi and Qiu Guo-bin were framing him due to a grudge because Wang Chen-shi had become involved with another person and had separated from him. However, Wang Chen-shi confessed that she had been cohabiting with Ji since last month and had never separated. She also detailed the course of Ji Ren-tang's gang robbery, stating that they had only conceived the idea six days prior.</p>
<p>Those involved in the conspiracy were Ji Ren-tang, Liu Xiao-si, Qiu Guo-bin, and a Mr. Wang, who discussed it three or four times, always meeting at her house. On one occasion, a security guard from the post office was also involved in the discussion, but she had never seen the security guard before. On the evening of September 9th, after the robbery, Ji took her to an unfamiliar place, where she received 7,000 yuan. She then gave 3,500 yuan to Liu Xiao-si, 250 yuan to Ji Chen-shi, and 200 yuan to Qiu Guo-bin, and kept 1,000 yuan for herself. The next day, Ji, Liu Xiao-si, and Yang Er-ma-zi (Zhou Yao-shi) returned to their hometown. She went part of the way with them,</p>
<p>returning to Shanghai by boat on the 19th. She then purchased a gold ring engraved with her name. On the 20th, she deposited 1,000 yuan at the Jin Cheng Bank, intending to withdraw the money using the gold ring's seal. At that time, Ji Chen-shi and Qiu Guo-bin both wanted to return to their hometown, and they asked her to go with them. She then carried 1,000 yuan back home for Ji Ren-tang, placing the money under her pillow. The deposit slip for her 1,000 yuan, however, was not taken; she sewed it into the lining of her clothes and hid it in a trunk in her Shanghai residence. When questioned, defendant Zhou Yao-shi gave evasive answers. Qiu Guo-bin admitted that the Monk Wu Kong gave him 200 yuan. After Judge Jiang questioned the remaining defendants one by one, he ordered Li Yi-sheng and Li Xue-shi to each post a 500 yuan surety, while the others were remanded in custody separately to await the next hearing on Wednesday afternoon.</p>
<h3 id="e101">Huang Automobile Company Declares Bankruptcy Yesterday: Sluggish Business, Financial Difficulties, 50,000 Yuan in Debt; Entrusts Lawyers and Accountants to Declare Liquidation According to Law <a href="#e101" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c101" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">101</a></h3>
<p>A Central News Agency report states that the China Public Huang Automobile Company, located at No. 534, Pushi Road, Shanghai, was originally founded by an American merchant. In 1928, it was taken over by Chinese businessmen. It currently has one hundred new and old cars and specializes in rental services. In recent years, competition within the industry has been fierce. After attracting customers by lowering prices, although business has been brisk, income has not met expenditure. Furthermore, a dispute over unpaid debts to the Asia Petroleum Factory has severely damaged its reputation. Yesterday, due to financial difficulties, the board of directors decided to cease operations and convened a meeting to handle the salaries and deposits owed to drivers and employees. After negotiations with the responsible parties, a resolution may be reached today. It is reported that the company's debt amounts to 50,000 yuan and is currently being liquidated according to law by entrusted lawyers and accountants. The details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Founding History</p>
<p>The Public Huang Automobile Company has been established for many years. It was initially operated by an American merchant, but due to poor business performance, it declared bankruptcy. The American court announced a public auction, and it was taken over by Chinese businessmen for a bid price of 110,300 yuan, collecting a fixed capital of 100,000 yuan and a working capital of 50,000 yuan. The head office was established on Pushi Road in the French Concession, and branch stations were subsequently added to various thoroughfares throughout the city, totaling eleven locations. It currently has approximately one hundred new cars, all painted yellow, which are quite eye-catching. Two years ago, when oil prices were low, business was very good.</p>
<p>Difficulties</p>
<p>In recent years, the business of renting out automobiles has flourished, leading to widespread price cuts to attract customers. However, with the gradual rise in oil prices and heavy tax burdens, many businesses have found it difficult to cover expenses. Although the company has been able to maintain operations, it has long been unprofitable, resulting in long overdue dividends. Two months ago, it was sued by the Asia Company in the Second Special District Court for owing approximately 10,000 yuan in oil debts. Although a settlement was reached with the condition of "paying off past debts and purchasing with cash in the future," it suffered a significant loss in reputation, leading to the termination of credit for oil purchases. Furthermore, car rentals were not easily collected on time, gradually leading to financial difficulties.</p>
<p>Decision to Close</p>
<p>At that time, the company convened a shareholders' meeting to discuss the difficult situation. It was decided to authorize the board of directors to handle the matter, and if absolutely necessary, to cease operations. Recently, due to fierce competition in the industry, prices were lowered to only 80 cents per 20 minutes, resulting in income not meeting expenditure. The salaries of the company's employees have been in arrears for a month. The day before yesterday, due to the depletion of working capital, operations ceased in the afternoon. That night, the board of directors decided to cease operations and appointed lawyer Guo Cheming and accountant Shen Jiazhen as representatives to liquidate according to law.</p>
<p>Declaration of Liquidation</p>
<p>Yesterday morning, a notice was posted at the entrance of the head office, signed by lawyer Guo Cheming and accountant Shen Jiazhen on behalf of China Public Huang Automobile Co., Ltd., declaring liquidation. The notice stated that, according to the company's board of directors, the company was unable to rotate its capital due to the impact of the economic depression. A shareholder meeting had decided to cease operations and liquidate, and the law firm and accounting firm were appointed as liquidators to handle the liquidation matters. In addition to accepting the commission and reporting it, the company's creditors were requested to bring their debt certificates to the accounting firm for registration within 15 days for verification. Debtors were also requested to send the amounts owed to the accounting firm for verification and receipt within 15 days, otherwise legal action would be taken.

<p>Employee Wage Claims</p>
<p>Approximately 300 company employees had not been paid their salaries for last month. Drivers had also each paid a deposit of 50 yuan. Upon seeing the company cease operations yesterday, they became alarmed and negotiated with the current manager, Zhang Xutang, who persuaded them to wait for liquidation. Police officers were dispatched by the French Concession police to maintain order, and fortunately, no incidents occurred. In the afternoon, ten employee representatives held a meeting with accountant Shen, lawyer Guo, and company representatives in the French Concession police station, but no results were achieved. It is reported that consultations will continue today and a solution may be found. The employees have also submitted petitions to the Municipal Drivers' Association and municipal party and government agencies for review.</p>

<p>Due to the impact of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company's joint transportation operations with the Longhai Railway and the sluggish market, the United Shipping Company's business has been severely affected. In order to seek a way out and develop, it recently received approval from the Longhai Railway Bureau to handle non-joint transportation goods at Lianyungang and made meticulous plans to open up a new route to Yancheng, as well as ports such as Wanfu and Funing. This time, it specially dispatched the Zhengzhou steamship directly to Yancheng, and it is reported that it has safely arrived at the port. Yancheng is located in the heart of Jiangsu Province and is rich in agricultural products. Steamships have never reached the area before. The company previously pioneered the Haizhou route, which led to the prosperity of the local market. Now, it is pioneering the Yancheng route. The future prosperity of the port can be expected. If the company continues to work hard to develop shipping, it is truly commendable.</p>

<p>The tiger at the Municipal Zoo on Wenmiao Road died after suffering from pleurisy while undergoing external treatment. The zoo had posted a notice outside its enclosure stating, "The tiger is currently ill." According to information gathered by a Datong News Agency reporter from the zoo, the tiger died a few days ago. It is reported that the tiger had been purchased from Guangxi by the former Municipal Public School Garden for 950 yuan. It was moved to the Municipal Zoo when it opened and displayed there. When the zoo noticed that the tiger was gradually weakening, it immediately reported it to veterinary consultant Wang Zhao-qi (Chief of the Second Section of the Health Bureau), who transported it for treatment, but it was ineffective. After it died, a dissection was immediately performed, revealing that the lung disease had reached the third stage and the lungs were severely decayed. The Eastern Instrument Company has been commissioned to prepare a taxidermied specimen. The zoo also plans to find another tiger to fill the vacancy.</p>

<p>Yesterday at 1:45 AM, in the still of the night, a young woman in fashionable attire suddenly threw herself into the river from the Waibaidu Bridge at the mouth of the Suzhou Creek. At that time, pedestrians had not completely disappeared from the road, and some had seen her jump into the water. Only a dull splash was heard, and when they went forward to try to rescue her, she was nowhere to be found. A crowd of onlookers gathered, all expressing a sigh of hopelessness. Chinese Constable No. 87 from the Customs Water Police Station also arrived after hearing the alarm and tried to rescue her, but after a long time, there was still no trace. According to witnesses, the young woman was about 23 or 24 years old, and the style of her clothing could not be remembered. The police station was notified to investigate the deceased's family and recover the body. It is expected that the identity of the young woman will be determined soon.</p>

<p>He Yi Tai Coal Store at Number 853 East of the Rihui Bridge outside Longhua Road in Shanghai South sent a driver Jin Amao (37 years old, from Chuansha, residing in a bungalow in the Xishenjia Ham, Albert Road, French Concession) at the morning of the 22nd, drove a number 227 truck loaded with coal to send to customers in the northern part of the city. At 11:20 at noon, the driver Jin Amao drove to the side of Ningbo Hall on Balili Bridge Road in the French Concession, heading north from the south. When he arrived at the Airlike Road intersection, a number 10 tram of the French company's Route 5 going to and from the Ximen North Station also headed north from the south. When it stopped near the Ningbo Road station in front of the truck, Mo Ruisheng (16 years old, from Shaoxing), an apprentice from the Nanhua Chang Laundry Store opened by Chen Jinchang from Shaoxing at Number 540 Huacheng Road, Min’guo Road in the French Concession, came out to collect clothes at Yuqingli, Xinxibridge Street (that is, Balili Bridge Road). Apprentice Mo walked along the east wall of the Ningbo Hall on Balili Bridge Road, heading north. At a point of over ten feet north of the Airlike Road intersection, he suddenly walked diagonally to the northwest, intending to cross the road. At that time, Jin Amao's truck intended to overtake the tram and drove straight north past the east side of the tram. Unexpectedly, apprentice Mo walked diagonally to the center of the road and could not avoid it. He was hit by the right fender of the truck, and his left hand was crushed by the wheels. His chest was also injured. Instantly, fresh blood spurted from his mouth. The patrolman saw the scene and immediately brought the driver Jin Amao and the truck to the Mailan Police Station. At the same time, he immediately sent an ambulance to take the injured person to the Guangci Hospital. Due to the severity of his injuries, he died upon arrival at the hospital. The body was moved to the mortuary of Tongren Fuyuan for an autopsy. At that time, it was impossible to investigate the name and family of the deceased. Until yesterday morning, the deceased's shop owner Chen Jinchang went to the mortuary to identify him and reported to the police. At noon, Wang Ren, the prosecutor of the Second Special Court, accompanied forensic doctor Wei, secretary Peng Yi, and others to the morgue to confirm the body and ascend the case. The police dispatched detectives to send the defendant, driver Jin Amao, to the case. The official questioned Jin about the circumstances of the accident. The deceased's shop owner Chen Jinchang reported that the deceased's family was in Shaoxing and a letter had been sent to notify them. He could not lead the corpse for collection on behalf of them; they would wait for the family members to arrive in Shanghai. Witness Yu Fusheng, a French tram driver, and Sun Wu and lawyer Fei Wenpin did not arrive. Prosecutor Wang proclaimed that Mo Ruisheng had died from injuries caused by the truck, and the body was handed over to Tongren Fuyuan Hall to collect it on their behalf for the family to collect. The defendant was sent to the court by the police department for legal handling. After the autopsy, the police sent the defendant Jin Amao to Criminal Court No. 1 of the Second Special Court. Judge Xiong questioned him, and Yuan Jia from the police department said that the defendant caused death due to negligence in his work, and the police investigation was not completed. He asked for an extension of the deadline to investigate the case and sue for trial. Defendant Yan Linqing defended the lawyer. The court verified the report, questioned the defendant, and then instructed that the hearing be postponed to 2 pm on the 28th, and the defendant would be remanded in custody. It is reported that the defendant's family is poor. His wife died last year, and he has an elderly father in his seventies and two young children to support. Now that the defendant is in custody because of the accident, the livelihood of the elderly and young at the door will be difficult from now on.</p>

<p>Zhou Shoutang, a native of Ningbo, was the manager of the Qingdao branch of the Huakang Military Uniform Store at No. 230 Xizang Road. In April of this year, the Jiaoji Railway entrusted Huakang to custom-make many employee uniforms, totaling 5,694 yuan. After the goods were delivered, the railway bureau gave the money to Zhou. However, Zhou did not remit it to the Shanghai headquarters but instead used it to engage in speculative business, losing the entire amount. Although Hou Guohua, the manager of the Shanghai headquarters, repeatedly telegraphed for remittance, there was no news. Hou then reported to the detective Xue Youwen of the Laozha Police Station, who arrested him the day before yesterday. Yesterday morning, he was sent to Court No. 1 of the First Special District Court. Police lawyer Wang Yaotang explained the case and prosecuted him in accordance with Article 366, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law, requesting a ruling according to the law. The Huakang store also hired lawyer Sun Zuqi to appear in court and file a civil suit, demanding a judgment ordering the defendant to return the embezzled money. When questioned, Zhou Shoutang confessed that he engaged in speculative business and embezzled the money. Judge Qian Hongye verified the confession and ordered the defendant to be remanded in custody and reschedule the hearing.</p>

<p>Chen Bingkui, a native of Hangzhou, 44 years old, lived at No. 493 Guangdong Road, worked as a professional "da chang" (that is, those who blow and sing to attract attention for general news stores). On the morning of the 16th of this month, Chen went to Ruichangxiang Tobacco and Paper Store at No. 64 Beihai Road to buy a pack of Ding Ding brand cigarettes. When he carried it back to smoke it, he suddenly found mold spots on the cigarettes. He took them back to the store to exchange them with the staff Jiang Huai (22 years old, from Wuxi). Jiang refused. The two sides started arguing. Then the two fought near the store. Later, Chen was defeated and returned home injured. At 11:00 AM of the same morning, the pain was unbearable, so he went to the store again to negotiate. After someone reported the incident to No. 2522 Chinese constable stationed nearby, Chen and Jiang were brought to the Laozha Police Station together. Deputy Chinese Detective Zhang Yuanjing and detective Xu Dezhong were ordered to investigate. Then Chen was sent to Renji Hospital for treatment, and a public prosecution was filed against Jiang in the First Special District Court. On the evening before last, at 8:50 PM, Chen died due to the worsening of his injuries. The body was moved to the mortuary on Feilun Road. Yesterday morning, Tang, the prosecutor of the First Special Court, accompanied two forensic doctors, Wei and Zhang, and secretary Wang Zuyi to the morgue to verify the body. First, the detectives reported the previous situation, saying that the defendant had only been prosecuted for injury crimes. Now that Chen had died of his injuries, the indictment against the defendant had been changed. Jiang Huai said that the Ding Ding brand cigarettes that the deceased held were just in batches yesterday and would not be moldy. Because they were not purchased in my store, I did not allow him to change them. He scolded me and pulled me out. At the door of the leather store at No. 66 next door, he was injured when he hit the wooden frame of the store because he used too much force. Then the leather store owner persuaded him to leave. Later, he called a few people to come, and I was afraid of extortion, so I went to the police station. He denied hitting him and causing injury. The wife of the deceased, Chen Zhushi, said that the deceased was beaten and injured, and later went there. He only saw him leave in a rickshaw, but did not call anyone. She asked for an explanation. After Hua constable No. 1322 reported the situation, Tang Jun confirmed that the deceased, Chen Bingkui, male, had died of injuries during his lifetime. The body was handed over to his representative, Chen Zhushi, to sign and return to the coffin.</p>

<h3 id="e109">Armed Robbers Resist Arrest, Gunfire Frequent on Changbang Road Yesterday Morning; Three Robbers Flee after Looting, Open Fire to Resist Arrest Mid-Way; One Robber Captured in Tavern, Three-Year-Old Child Injured <a href="#e109" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c109" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">109</a></h3>
<p>Around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, armed robbers resisting arrest suddenly occurred near the junction of Changbang Road and Chongqing Road in the Public Concession. Gunfire rang out frequently for a while, and passersby fled in panic. As a result, one robber was caught, and a stray bullet injured a child, whose condition is very critical. Details are recorded below:</p>
<p>Sudden Appearance of Three Robbers</p>
<p>Around 6:00 AM yesterday morning, three robbers suddenly appeared at the Wanlong Tobacco and Paper Store at No. 28 Gujia Lane, Luban Road, French Concession. One robber was wearing a Western suit and carrying a pistol. At that time, the store owner Zheng Shouyin and the store's employees were fast asleep and were awakened by the robbers who forbade them to make a sound. They were robbed of approximately 500 yuan in large and small coins.</p>
<p>Flight with Looted Goods</p>
<p>The three robbers fled together towards Hualong Road. At that time, the two robbers wearing Chinese clothing split up and fled south, while the robber in the Western suit with the gun ran north. The owner of the store, Zheng Shouwangyin, had already tracked them out and urgently reported to the local patrolman, who blew his whistle and chased closely. The robber knew things were going badly and immediately fled north.</p>
<p>Frequent Gunfire</p>
<p>When they were chasing to Changbang Road near Edward Road, the robber was about to cross the Public Concession when he was spotted by the patrolman there, who drew his gun to intercept him. Seeing this, the robber immediately raised his gun and fired at the patrolman, who returned fire. Thus, gunfire rang out frequently on Changbang Road, and passersby fled in a panic. Both sides fired more than a dozen shots at each other.</p>
<p>Fleeing into a Tavern</p>
<p>After a while, the robber ran out of bullets and was unable to hold on. He took the opportunity to escape into Male Lane and then slipped from the lane into the back door of the Dahonglou Tavern and went straight into the store hall. At that time, the tavern's employees and apprentices were sound asleep. In desperation, the robber used his quick wit to squeeze into an employee's quilt, hoping to get lucky.</p>
<p>Captured Without Resistance</p>
<p>At that time, the detectives saw the robber flee into the lane. Since only the back door of Dahonglou was not closed, they were sure that he had fled into the store, and they immediately rushed in to search. The robber surrendered and was taken to the Chengdu Road Police Station. After the Western Detective Chief questioned him in detail, the robber confessed that his name was Li Dianbing, 24 years old, from Shandong, and he admitted that he had ganged up to commit the robbery.</p>
<p>Child Wounded by Bullet</p>
<p>He also confessed the names of many accomplices. When the detectives went to arrest them at the addresses provided, the robbers had already heard the news and fled. During the shootout, a three-year-old child named Dai Agou was injured by a stray bullet, and his condition is very critical. Currently, the Chengdu Road Police Station and the French Police Station are working together to track down the remaining members of the gang.</p>
<h3 id="e110">Yu Qiaqing Continues to Wire for Cessation: Xuchang Company Purchasing Tobacco <a href="#e110" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c110" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">110</a></h3>
<p>Collaboration between Tobacco Gathering Industry and Cigarette Industry to Prevent Foreign Economic Aggression</p>
<p>The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce and the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai previously received a report from the Tobacco Industry Association stating that the Xuchang Company was being manipulated by foreign merchants to monopolize tobacco purchasing. They telegraphed Chairman Chiang Kai-shek and the Ministers of Finance and Industry, requesting a ban. Subsequently, Yang Peiqing, the founder and shareholder of the Xuchang Company, issued a statement exposing the company's inside story, further revealing the truth. Now, it is reported that Mr. Yu Qiaqing, considering that this case concerns foreign invasion of the inland economy, has again telegraphed the Executive Yuan and the Ministries of Finance and Industry, urgently requesting their intervention to stop it. At the same time, the Tobacco Leaf Association also hosted cigarette merchants, explaining everything. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Yu Qiaqing Continues to Wire for Cessation: Xuchang Company Purchasing Tobacco</p>
<p>Distributed to Military Committee Chairman Chiang, Executive Yuan President Wang, Finance Minister Kong, Industry Minister Chen Junjian: Tobacco leaves are produced in the Xuchang area of Henan. Tobacco merchants from Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, and Hankou, as well as cigarette manufacturers from various ports, regularly purchase there. No fewer than 300,000 Chinese people rely on this for a living. Years ago, the British American Tobacco Company, through its Chinese staff, set up a factory in Xuchang to collect tobacco, manufacture it, and sell it, monopolizing and oppressing the people, causing them suffering. Fortunately, the authorities of the province discovered this and immediately ordered it to stop, preserving the livelihoods of the Chinese people. Unexpectedly, now some people are colluding with foreign merchants, reviving the old trick. Initially, the Xuchang Company came forward to plan it, and then, under the name of the Yu-Su Cured Tobacco Factory, gradually transferred control to the British American Tobacco Company. Now, they have gathered huge funds to set up a factory there, and are already heavily purchasing tobacco, planning to sweep everything away. The industry association sees this as a foreign economic invasion, and if it is implemented, the livelihoods of the Chinese people will surely be cut off. Therefore, they are appealing to all parties to jointly stop it. The Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, after investigating and clarifying the facts, telegraphed on their behalf, and Yang Peiqing, a shareholder and founder of the Xuchang Company, also declared that collusion with foreign merchants was inappropriate, revealing the truth and stating that he would never recognize it. However, recently it has been heard that those colluding with foreign merchants dare to use the name of the Tobacco Leaf Improvement Committee to decorate their words and deceive, hoping to achieve their private goals. Because this matter concerns the livelihoods of hundreds of thousands of people, and many of those engaged in this are from Ningbo, due to the deep friendship with our hometown, we dare not suppress the information. Therefore, we urgently appeal to your seats in the Yuan and Ministries to quickly take charge and issue orders to the Henan Provincial Government to vigorously stop it, so as to avoid harming the local area and maintain the livelihoods of the people, benefiting the masses. We all deeply appreciate and praise you. Yu Hede of the Ningbo Native Association in Shanghai bows respectfully.</p>
<p>Tobacco Leaf Industry Reception</p>
<p>The Shanghai Tobacco Leaf Industry Association hosted cigarette factory owners last night at the Shipping Club. Dozens of people attended. First, Chen Chenglun, Chairman of the Association, and Wang Zuoting, representative of the Executive Committee, delivered speeches, stating that the Xuchang Company is nominally a Chinese business but in reality a tool of foreign economic aggression, and that both the tobacco leaf industry and the cigarette factory industry will suffer from it, hoping for cooperation to stop it, and so on. Then, Yang Peiqing, the founder and shareholder of the Xuchang Company, reported on all the contents of the Xuchang Company and the process of transferring sovereign industry into the hands of foreign merchants, detailing how Wu Tingsheng colluded with foreign merchants, lost national sovereignty, and damaged the legal interests of shareholders. Leaders of cigarette factories stood up to speak, saying that after listening to Mr. Yang's statements, they knew all the inside stories of the Xuchang Company, and especially understood that Mr. Wu Tingsheng's so-called tobacco leaf improvement was not for public good but for personal gain. Considering the public interest, we must do our best to resist his actions. Then, Yu Qiaqing stood up to speak, saying that for the sake of the country and compatriots, Qiaqing had to speak out righteously. While the tobacco leaf industry is primarily harmed by this matter, the cigarette factory industry is also greatly harmed because foreign tobacco companies have strong capital, light raw material prices, and advance payment of unified taxes also gives them an advantage. Therefore, the cost of production is reduced, and the torrent of dumping cannot be resisted. If they are further allowed to manipulate the raw materials of the domestic tobacco industry, then in the future, the raw materials needed by Chinese cigarette factories will be difficult to obtain. Even if they are available, they will not be affordable at high prices. Once the raw material market is occupied, they can raise prices or suppress prices, adapt to changes, and do whatever they want. Therefore, the harm to the cigarette factory industry is very serious. Furthermore, the company purchases tobacco leaves based on low prices as the principle and high prices as the exception. Tobacco farmers also suffer no small amount. Today, the cigarette factory industry and the tobacco leaf industry are gathering together, hoping that everyone will unite and cooperate sincerely to determine concrete measures to stop this matter. Finally, those present discussed all the countermeasures and proceeded actively.</p>

It reopened yesterday. Details are recorded as follows:</p>
<p>Organizing a Banking Consortium to Support Resumption of Business</p>
<p>The company's factory is located at Gaolang Bridge on Huade Road. Since last winter, due to rural bankruptcy and weak purchasing power, inventory piled up. Furthermore, with the sudden economic collapse of society, capital was difficult to turn over, and it had to suspend operations, which has been the case for half a year. Now, the business community in this city, in order to support the national product industry and relieve unemployed workers, has specially organized a banking consortium to operate the company. The organization has been successfully formed. The name of the banking consortium is "Huiye." The office is located at No. 8, Dongfukang Lane, Tianjin Road.</p>
<p>The Banking Consortium's Notice of Reopening Yesterday</p>

<p>Business is Quite Developed</p>
<p>Since the establishment of the Central Trust Bureau headquarters and its local agencies, business has been quite developed. A Xin Xin News Agency reporter learned from the bureau yesterday that people in various places, because they do not understand the bureau's trust business rules, have been asking whether the bureau can accept private trust matters. The bureau believes that private trusts, such as trust deposits and trading of securities, are all stipulated in the trust business rules. If there are entrustments, they should be accepted as much as possible. Therefore, various parties are enthusiastically entrusting private trust matters.</p>

<p>Studied in Japan for Ten Years and Authored Extensively</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Xiuzhe, a graduate of the Graduate School of Tokyo Imperial University in Japan, has been studying international law, diplomatic history, international politics, and other issues in Japan for about ten years. Recently, his monumental work in Japanese, "The National Government, Diplomacy, and Diplomatic Administration," was published in Tokyo, causing a sensation in Japanese academic circles. It was praised as a rare masterpiece in diplomatic history. The first edition of the book sold out within days. Among them, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government purchased ten copies, and the Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs specially purchased fifty copies to distribute to its embassies and consulates in various countries as a reference for understanding Chinese diplomacy. The General Staff Headquarters of the National Government also purchased twenty copies, and the Minister of Interior Huang Fu purchased fifty copies, the Beining Railway Bureau purchased twenty copies, etc. Other pre-orders were extremely crowded, showing the importance that China and Japan attach to the book. The book is the first publication by a Chinese student on political and diplomatic issues written in Japanese. The arguments are all based on the Chinese position, introducing the revolutionary diplomacy of the National Government and explaining the Kuomintang's foreign policy without omission.

<h3 id="e119">Guangdong Miss's Maid Abuse Case Opens <a href="#e119" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c119" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">119</a></h3>
<p>Righteous People All Testify in Court, Prosecutor Has Already Filed Indictment</p>
<p>The case of Miss Tan Huizhu, a Guangdong native residing in Deren Lane, Xingjia Bridge, in this city, who abused her maid, has attracted much attention from the public since it was exposed by righteous people and the China Children's Welfare Association. On the 3rd of this month, Prosecutor Zhang Zi of the District Court formally filed an indictment with the Criminal Court. On the morning of the 22nd of this month (i.e., the day before yesterday), the judge opened the court to hear the case. Zhang Yueru, an officer of the China Children's Welfare Association, also went to attend the hearing. The details are recorded below.</p>
<p>Opening of the Hearing</p>
<p>First, the bailiff brought Tan Huizhu to the court. The judge asked her about her age and origin, and then stated the prosecutor's charges of illegally injuring the maid Xuejuan. According to Tan Huizhu's testimony, she denied the injury and claimed that Xuejuan was her cousin. Then, the maid Xuejuan was questioned, but because of her age and language barrier, she did not understand much. Then, Zhao Baoqing, the gatekeeper of Deshi Lane, was questioned. According to his testimony, Tan Huizhu had been living in Deren Lane for more than three months. She often abused the maid Xuejuan. In early September, she used a red-hot iron hook to burn multiple areas of her face. Then, the reporter Tan Guanman was questioned. According to his testimony, Tan Huizhu was his neighbor and kept a maid Xuejuan, whom she often abused. If she did not comply with her wishes, she would whip her. In early last month, she used torture and burned Xuejuan's face with a red-hot iron hook in many places. Because he felt sorry for Xuejuan, he specially reported it to the China Children's Welfare Association, asking them to find a way to help her, entirely out of righteousness and humanity. Finally, the household registration police officer from Yongxing Road Police Station was questioned. According to his testimony, on September 10, he accompanied a representative from the China Children's Welfare Association to investigate Tan Huizhu's abuse of her maid and the burning of her cheeks, which was indeed the case. The weapon, the iron hook, is still stored in the police station for record. After the judge finished questioning, he announced the adjournment because further investigation was necessary. A hearing was scheduled for another day. Tan Huizhu was released on bail of one thousand yuan in cash. If she cannot pay bail, she will be remanded in custody.</p>
<p>Original Indictment</p>
<p>"Defendant Tan Huizhu, female, 20 years old, from Dongguan, residing in Deren Lane, Xingjia Bridge. The defendant in the case of obstructing freedom and injury, Detective No. 3578 of the Republic of China, has been investigated by this prosecutor and is deemed to warrant prosecution. The defendant's criminal facts and evidence, as well as the relevant legal provisions, are listed below: (1) Criminal Facts: Tan Huizhu is from Guangdong and resides at No. 17, Deren Lane, Xingjiaqiao Road, in this city. Last summer, she bought a maid named Xuejuan (now 8 years old) in her hometown for service. On the morning of September 1, Tan Huizhu ordered Xuejuan to light the stove, and because the charcoal fire was flying around, she used a charcoal fire to brand Xuejuan's right cheek. The matter was reported to the neighbor Tan Li, who informed her husband Tan Guanman to report it. The case was sent by the Shanghai Municipal Public Security Bureau. (2) Evidence and Legal Provisions: Xuejuan has been examined by a forensic doctor and found to have a light white superficial scar on her left cheek, the size of a broad bean, surrounded by a cloud-like brown halo, the size of a copper coin. On her right cheek, there are two light white superficial scars, shaped like silkworms, surrounded by a cloud-like brown halo, approximately the size of a silver dollar. It is determined to be a burn from a hot object. Tan Huizhu's parents and Xuejuan all stated that it was a charcoal fire burn, caused by the ashes flying up when Xuejuan was lighting the charcoal stove. However, she claimed that the secretary of the neighborhood went to secretly investigate. According to the report, Xuejuan is indeed Tan Huizhu's maid and is often abused. It is confirmed that the burns were inflicted. Zhao Baoqing, the gatekeeper of the neighborhood, was questioned and stated that Tan Xuejuan is indeed a maid and that he heard people in the neighborhood say that the maid's face was burned and that the young lady of the house was very fierce, etc. The statements of Tan Li are consistent with the statements of Zhao Baoqing and the investigation report. From this, it can be seen that Xuejuan's burns are evidence of Tan Huizhu's abuse. Moreover, the injuries to Xuejuan's cheeks are not insignificant. It is unreasonable for Tan Huizhu's parents to say that it was done by the neighbor Tan Li but remain silent all along. Moreover, the report in this case was made by the husband of Tan Li, which shows that it was a retaliatory act. Based on the above, the defendant has committed the crimes under Article 296, paragraph 1, and Article 286, paragraph 1, of the Criminal Code and should be prosecuted in accordance with Article 230, paragraph 1, of the Code of Criminal Procedure. Respectfully submitted to the Criminal Court of this Court."</p>

<p>Russian Fish Weighing Fraud Case Trial Record</p>
<p>Each Defendant's Testimony; Awaiting Summons of Soviet Russian Assistance Association Representative</p>
<p>Last winter, the salted fish industry in this city purchased 50,000 piculs of salmon from the Soviet Russian Assistance Association Foreign Firm. During the weighing at the wharf, there was a fraud of 6,700 piculs, worth over 70,000 yuan. Now, Zhu Xusheng, Chang Junfa, Zhao Lianfang, and others who jointly committed the fraud, feared that once the matter was exposed, they would be suspected of joint fraud. Moreover, the case of tax evasion was serious and should be reported. Therefore, on July 14, they surrendered to the Municipal Public Security Bureau, which was instructed to transfer them to the Local Court Procuratorate. Prosecutor Xiao Jin'ying conducted several investigations and concluded that the defendants Zhu Xusheng, Chang Junfa, Zhao Lianfang, Weng Zhaofang, Ye Zhenchang, Zheng Yunsheng, and others should be released on bail. Meanwhile, a public prosecution was filed according to law. The facts of the crime were that defendants Weng Zhaofang, Ye Zhenchang, and Zheng Yunsheng all opened fish shops. Last year, they ordered 50,000 piculs of salmon from the Soviet Russian Assistance Association Foreign Firm. On November 13, December 23, and January 6 of this year, when the fish ships delivered the fish at the Yangjiadu Wharf, Weng Zhaofang and others ordered Zhu Xusheng to consult with workers Chang Junfa and Zhao Lianfang, and shipping clerks Ye Zhenqin and Zhang Benhua, etc., to lift the carrying poles when the fish boxes were weighed, so that the quantity was reduced. A total of 6,700 piculs of fish were obtained from the three ships, worth 70,000 yuan in foreign currency. Presiding Judge Wu Deying had held court to examine the case but had not concluded it and was awaiting further trial. Now, it is learned that at 2:00 PM yesterday, Judge Wu specially opened the third session to hear the case. The lawyers Zhu Yakui, Zhang Shizhao, and Peng Yuanxun, etc., who had been hired by the defendants, arrived in court one after another to defend them. First, the wharf coolies Chen Shiyi, Chen San, Pan Huaiyu, Song Changhong, and others were summoned to the case. According to their testimony, when the salmon arrived at the wharf, they were responsible for carrying it. Chang Junfa, Zhu Xusheng, Ye Zhenqin, and others secretly instructed them to commit fraud. When carrying the fish for weighing, the ropes were not completely loosened, so that the quantity could be reduced. They were promised that after the salmon in the warehouse was sold out, they would be given a share of the fraudulent profits. But now it has been sold out for a long time, and they have not yet been paid. The official asked if the foreign weighers were present at the scene. They answered yes. The official asked if the foreigners interfered when they did not loosen the ropes. They answered that they did interfere, but Ye Zhenqin told them to be bold and do as they were told, and that he would take responsibility for everything. The official asked how much each coolie was paid per day. They answered that they were paid 100 copper coins per day and a bonus of one yuan. Next, Chang Junfa testified that each box of salmon should weigh more than 70 pounds, but due to the fraud, it only weighed more than 60 pounds. Then, Zhu Xusheng testified that Ye Zhenchang and Ye Zhenqin were brothers, and Zhang Benhua was Ye's brother-in-law, so Zhang was assigned as the bookkeeper. They ordered the coolies not to loosen the ropes. It was found that the salmon was purchased by Huafu Fish Shop, Shenfeng Fish Shop, etc. Because they were not familiar with Russian, Ye Zhenchang, the owner of Zhenda Foreign Firm, came forward to order the fish. Next, Zhao Lianfang testified that he was a shipping clerk. Huafu Fish Shop was organized by 24 fish shops. Next, Zhang Benhua testified that he was a shipping clerk for Zhenda Foreign Firm. The salmon was ordered by Zhenda Foreign Firm, and the fish shops turned to Zhenda to buy it. Next, Ye Zhenqin testified that he used to be in the fish business and is now in the newspaper business. When the salmon arrived at the wharf last year, he was responsible for copying the goods at the wharf. Zhao Lianfang was the shipping clerk for Huafu Fish Shop. Huafu Fish Shop was organized by 26 fish shops and specialized in salmon business. The salmon was ordered by Zhenda Foreign Firm from the Soviet Russian Assistance Association. The official asked if Huafu Shenfeng Fish Shop ordered it but used the name of Zhenda Foreign Firm to purchase it. He answered no. Next, Zheng Yunsheng testified that he was the manager of Shengji Fish Shop at No. 83, 16th Pier. The official asked what position he held in Huafu before. He answered that he was a purchasing agent. The manager of Huafu was surnamed Fang. Huafu was formed by 26 fish shops. Next, Weng Zhaofang testified that he was 53 years old and a traveling salesman for Jieshun Salted Goods Shop on Gualou Street outside Xiaodongmen. This lawsuit was instigated by someone. Next, Ye Zhenchang testified that he was the manager of Zhenda Foreign Firm. The official asked why Zhu Xusheng, Zhao Lianfang, Chang Junfa, and others were suing him. He answered that they wanted to blackmail him and buy out the wharf coolies. The official said that according to him, they were blackmailing him and buying out the wharf coolies, but they had not yet succeeded in blackmailing him and had to spend their capital first. At this point, the court said that there would be no debate today. The representatives of the Soviet Russian Assistance Association would be summoned to court for questioning to verify the facts. The defendants were still released on their original bail.</p>

<h3 id="e125">China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture to Discuss Free Education Funds <a href="#e125" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c125" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">125</a></h3>
<p>Investigation of National Secondary School Problems Still in Question</p>
<p>Special Dispatch from Beiping: The Board of Directors of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture will hold its second general meeting of the year in Shanghai on the 26th. The directors in Beiping, Li Shizeng, Hu Shi, Jin Shuchu, Zhou Yichun, and Executive Secretary Sun Hongfen, etc., left Beiping for Shanghai around the 20th. Director-General Ren Hongjun, who also serves as the president of Sichuan University, flew from Chengdu to Shanghai on the 19th by Eurasian giant aircraft to attend the meeting.</p>
<p>Four Items on the Meeting Agenda</p>
<p>The meeting agenda has been decided by the Executive Committee, mainly including four items: (1) Work reports from the Secretary-General, Accounting, and Documentation departments; (2) Discussion on how to handle the Ministry of Education's request for the Foundation to subsidize 150,000 yuan for compulsory education expenses; (3) Discussion on how to proceed with the investigation of national secondary school problems, or whether to postpone it; (4) The Foundation's rules of procedure were drafted when the Foundation was established in 1920 and are quite outdated and not very applicable to the current situation. In order to reorganize internal work, the Foundation decided to promote the discussion of how to draft new rules of procedure at this meeting.</p>
<p>Compulsory Education Funding Problem</p>
<p>The compulsory education funding subsidy problem is the most difficult to resolve among the issues to be discussed at this meeting. The Ministry of Education originally convened a joint meeting of various Boxer Indemnity organizations to promote and universalize compulsory education in the country, and it was agreed to request the Foundation to subsidize 400,000 yuan. However, when the Foundation held its annual meeting in April of this year, it discussed the matter. As a result, the Foundation felt that due to the economic downturn in recent years, its finances were already insufficient to allocate and it was unable to raise this large sum, so it rejected the request. Later, the Ministry of Education reduced the amount to 150,000 yuan and still requested the Foundation to subsidize it. The Foundation felt that it could not refuse, so it planned to allocate funds from the foreign exchange fees saved over the past two years, but it could only raise 70,000 to 80,000 yuan, which was still half of the planned amount. Therefore, this meeting will raise this issue for discussion.</p>
<p>Dr. Monroe's Proposal</p>
<p>Dr. Paul Monroe, President of the International Education Research Association, Dean of the Teachers College of Columbia University in the United States, and Director of the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture, came to China this year. In view of the rapid development of secondary education in China in the past ten years, but due to regional differences, the levels are uneven, and the Ministry of Education lacks investigation. The Ministry of Education only investigated national secondary education up to 1930. In order to have accurate investigation and improve it, Dr. Monroe proposed that the China Foundation for the Promotion of Education and Culture should carry out this work, and famous educators could be invited from the United States to help voluntarily. The Foundation also considered this matter to be very important, but it was not easy to carry out and required the employment of many specialized personnel. It was estimated that it would take more than a year to complete and would cost 40,000 to 50,000 yuan. Therefore, it will be discussed how to proceed under the current situation of insufficient funds, or whether to suspend it.</p>
<h3 id="e126">Polish Government Subsidy for One Chinese Student to Study in Poland <a href="#e126" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c126" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">126</a></h3>
<p>Ministry of Education Formulates Selection Method</p>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued an order to the national and provincial universities and independent colleges with engineering departments on the 22nd, stating: "According to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs' document No. 9240 on October 2nd, 1935, and the Polish Minister's note on September 24th, the Ministry of Education of this country, in order to enhance cultural relations between China and Poland, plans to establish a scholarship for the academic year 1935-1936, with 250 Polish zlotys per month, specifically to subsidize one Chinese student to study in Poland. According to the opinion of the Ministry of Education of this country, this subsidy is limited to twelve months and will be given at the beginning of the academic year, that is, starting from October 1st, 1935. However, if the selected student wishes to study at any university in Poland, the Ministry of Education plans to add some subsidies for tuition fees. If the student does not wish to attend classes at any university, he/she may go to Poland after October 1st, and the subsidy will be calculated from the date of his/her arrival in Poland, deducting twelve months. In addition, student subsidies are paid monthly, and students can start receiving them after reporting to the Higher Education Department of the Polish Ministry of Education upon arrival in Poland. Round-trip travel expenses to Poland are to be borne by the students themselves, but they can live in student dormitories. As for the method of selecting this subsidized student, the Minister believes that it is best for the Chinese Ministry of Education to liaise with the Polish Embassy in Shanghai to handle it. The above-mentioned points are requested to be forwarded to the Ministry of Education of your country. The Minister also hopes that this proposal will make the cultural relations between China and Poland closer. Accordingly, please investigate, etc." The number of students for this subsidy is now stipulated to be those studying civil engineering or mechanical engineering. The Ministry will provide 800 yuan in national currency for travel expenses to and from the country. Regarding the application qualifications and selection methods, eight regulations have been formulated. In addition to separate orders, a copy of the "Measures for Selecting Subsidized Students to Study in Poland" is enclosed for the school to be informed.</p>

<h3 id="e132">The Problem of Study Load and Teaching Time for Middle School Students (Part 3) <a href="#e132" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c132" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">132</a></h3>
<p>— Yi Ping</p>
<p>Currently, the weekly teaching hours stipulated in our country are 36 hours for the first three semesters of junior high school, 25 hours for the fourth semester, 36 hours for the fifth semester, and 35 hours for the sixth semester (each of these includes scout training). For senior high school, the weekly teaching hours are 34 hours for the first three semesters, 33 hours for the fourth semester, and 31 hours each for the fifth and sixth semesters. Vertically, these regulations do not exceed the historical stipulations of our country. Horizontally, they are slightly more than those of middle schools in France and Italy, and less than those in Soviet Russia. They are roughly the same as those in England and Germany. As for the total number of hours spent in class and self-study for junior high school students, it is stipulated as eight hours per day, totaling 48 hours per week. For senior high school students, the total number of hours spent in class, self-study, and extracurricular activities is stipulated as ten hours per day, totaling 60 hours per week. Although this regulation cannot be directly compared, it is not unreasonable. First, junior high school students are younger and need more rest for their physical and mental development. Therefore, the spirit of the "three eights system" for labor is adopted, setting the weekly workload at 48 hours. Apart from the 35-36 hours of teaching, they can have 12-13 hours of self-study. The distribution ratio is about one to three. Within the teaching time, some subjects require more self-study, while others do not require self-study or require less. By averaging out the differences, it is generally acceptable. Although extracurricular sports and activities are not included in the school's self-study time, their nature is light and relaxing, which is a good way to regulate the heavy workload. The amount of time can be determined and used by the school at its discretion. Second, the teaching hours for upper grades in middle schools in various countries are more than those for lower grades. The current system in our country has fewer teaching hours for senior high school than for junior high school, and fewer teaching hours for upper grades of senior high school than for lower grades. This does not violate the general trend, but is because the content of senior high school subjects is deeper, faster, and more complex, and students have stronger self-study abilities. Therefore, more self-study time should be allocated to each subject. Although the teaching hours are less, the total daily workload increases from eight to ten hours.</p>
<p>In fact, the weight of the study load cannot be simply explained by the number of teaching hours. There are too many factors related to the study load. First, there is the issue of teaching materials. The teaching of a certain subject for the same one hour can have simple content, not requiring much pre-class preparation or post-class review, or it can be very complex, requiring multiple times the amount of time for cloud learning. The teaching materials for each subject should be appropriately stipulated according to the total teaching hours of the subject and the estimated self-study time, considering the students' level, so as to avoid the drawbacks of uneven depth and being insufficient or unable to be taught completely. The teaching materials for each teaching hour should also be appropriately allocated, avoiding situations of improper emphasis or uneven load. This distribution of teaching materials is what the curriculum standards should achieve first. The current middle school curriculum standards for each subject inevitably vary in detail, with some being more specific and appropriate, and others being exceptionally empty and difficult to follow. They urgently need to be reviewed. Some say that if we were to stipulate in more detail, then that would be detailed teaching materials. Whether it is an outline or detailed specifications, the substance and quantity of teaching materials for each subject still need to be carefully studied and clearly stipulated or supplemented, so that there is a correct basis for the quantity of each time unit in learning. Second, there is the issue of textbooks. How to deduce a concrete teaching material from a teaching material outline and express it to students in a way that is easy for them to understand and learn is the skill of textbook compilation. How to review textbooks to select the best and eliminate the worst, so that poor textbooks disappear from schools, is the work of reviewing and approving textbooks. These two aspects are what the country and society should plan well for the youth's study load. Third, there is the issue of teaching aids. The equipment of laboratories, libraries, workshops, and all teaching instruments is undoubtedly closely related to the learning process. To improve teaching efficiency and reduce the study load, teaching equipment is absolutely indispensable. Fourth, there is the issue of education. Teaching materials, textbooks, and teaching aids are all static, while teachers are dynamic. Without teachers to use them, everything is external. With diligent teachers, everything comes alive, and good teachers can also make up for various deficiencies, exert the highest efficiency in teaching, and reduce the study load. Fifth, there is the general discipline situation of the school. A good school life can encourage interest in learning and promote effort in learning everywhere. The personality of each young person is well understood by the faculty and staff, and the entire life of each young person is noticed by the faculty and staff. Individual difficulties are corrected, and physical and mental fatigue is regulated. The learning process can progress smoothly, so how can there be any unbearable burden?</p>
<p>The teaching materials, textbooks, teaching aids, teachers, and general discipline situation mentioned above are all basic factors of the study load. To reduce the current study load of middle school students, a detailed study should be made of these five aspects, and then a solution can be obtained. Otherwise, simply focusing on the current middle school teaching hours, which are not unsuitable, and trying to reduce them, not to mention that any reduction will not reach any special stage, even if it is greatly reduced to a discounted level, while other basic factors related to learning remain the same, I believe, I am sure, the study load of middle school students will not be reduced in any way. We naturally cannot unconditionally support the current education system with an attitude of clinging to the old and defending the obsolete, and wish it longevity. But when we discuss a problem, we should grasp the core of the problem, and not engage in superficial arguments. If we only discuss the study load of middle school students from the perspective of teaching hours, we are really addressing the symptom and not the cause. If we further criticize the current middle school teaching hour system based on shallow observations and erroneous facts, then that is a fool's errand. (The End)</p>

<p>The meeting period is four consecutive days from the 30th of this month to November 2nd. Social education personnel in the Yutang People's Education Guidance Area are invited to participate.</p>
<p>Niu Changyao, the party affairs instructor of the Second District, believes that social education is an important issue for the revival of the people. In recent years, national consciousness has declined, the people's knowledge has been low, and the nation's foundation and the people's livelihood are in critical condition. Promoting social education is an urgent task today. Since the Provincial Party Department determined that social education is the central task, the social education undertakings carried out by the party departments of the counties in the Second District have achieved considerable results. In order to gather ideas and discuss plans, the Social Education Implementation Discussion was organized to convene committee members from the party departments of the counties in the district, and some heads of people's education centers in the guidance area of the Yutang People's Education Center were invited to hold a social education implementation discussion meeting. It is reported that the office has already issued orders to the party departments of the counties, designating one committee member to attend, and attaching various issues to solicit opinions, so that they can be discussed at the meeting. The date has now been set from October 30th to November 2nd as the meeting schedule. Yutang Chrysanthemum has been famous for a long time, and the thousands of purples and reds will be a point of embellishment for the conference. It is also reported that the 5th Yutang Chrysanthemum Exhibition will be held on the 16th of next month.</p>

<p>— Original by Ms. Alcott of the United States, translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>Little Tandy never forgot his old friend. Upon hearing that name, he struggled out of his father's arms and ran with nimble steps to the door, looking at the sun-drenched plaza spread with fine grass, with a look of longing on his face. He ran back, skipping and jumping, and stubbornly said as before (because he always said this after each expectation and disappointment):</p>
<p>"My Donald will come, old." (Note)</p>
<p>"I really think we should keep him here, if only for Tandy's sake. He likes him so much. Maybe the child's feelings can do what we haven't been able to do."</p>
<p>"I sometimes have that feeling too, but since the children have been making such a fuss and almost burned down the whole house, I think for safety's sake, we have to remove that spark, at least send him away for a while," Mr. Pei said.</p>
<p>"Lunch is ready, let me ring the bell," Robert said, and played a solo on that "instrument," so fiercely that he couldn't even hear himself talking.</p>
<p>"Ten Nans are also OK, as long as you want, my dear, and can accommodate all the naughty children in the world without anyone taking care of them.</p>
<p>"Ten Nans are also OK, as long as you want, my dear," Mr. Pei replied, in his great compassionate heart.</p>

<p>Group A was vacant last week due to the National Games; Donghua vs. Innis on Sunday</p>
<p>This season's West League Football Match opened on the 12th of this month. Group A matches were vacant last week due to the National Games. There will be a total of eleven groups competing this Saturday, and ten groups on Sunday. The two Group A matches on Saturday are French Business vs. Western Business at Yiyuan, and Youyou vs. Portugal at Shenyuan. The three Group A matches on Sunday are Shell vs. Western Arrest at Yiyuan, and Donghua vs. Innis at Shenyuan. Donghua is the defending champion, and this is their first appearance. They will face a strong enemy, Innis, so they must be careful to maintain their reputation. The Lax vs. Jewish match is at the Racecourse. The registration for the association's Scott Cup, International Cup, Junior Cup, and Ziling Cup has been closed, and there has been an enthusiastic response. There are eleven teams in the Scott Cup, including Donghua and Youyou. There are six teams in the International Cup, including China and England. There are twenty-five teams in the Junior Cup, including Donghua, Youyou, Innis, and Yousheng. There are twenty-seven teams in the Ziling Cup, including Youyou, Donghua, Portugal, and Yousheng.

<p>Not many Chinese participants; Lin Qiu doubles have hope for the championship.</p>
<p>The Hard Court Tennis Championship hosted by the Shanghai French Business Association is scheduled to begin competing on the 26th of this month and will last for nine days (the 26th and 27th of this month and the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, 6th, 9th, and 10th of next month). It is divided into five events: men's singles, men's doubles, women's singles, women's doubles, and mixed doubles. The order has now been drawn. There are a total of fifteen pairs in men's singles. The Chinese participants are Wang Wenzheng, Ma Anquan, Chen Yi, Qiu Feihai, Qian Yaobin, Guo Yujie, and Chen Jun. I am afraid there is not much hope for the championship. Qiu Feihai is old, and although Wenzheng is strong, he is far from Carson's opponent. However, the cooperation between Wang Wenzheng and Qian Yaobin in the fourteen groups for men is excellent. Lin Qiu is the champion of this National Games, so this championship is more certain. There will be wonderful performances by Deutefu and Carson, and the tension of the battle can be expected. No Chinese people participated in women's singles. In doubles, there are only the Wei Zutong and Wei Maigu sisters. They will meet Mrs. Ovida and Mrs. Tuiluo in the first week. I think the Wei sisters have made rapid progress recently and should be worth watching. In mixed doubles, Qiu Feihai is paired with Mrs. Howell. I don't know if they can win the championship.</p>

<p>In the National Games Individual Sports, a Total of 108 Points Were Obtained</p>
<p>The East Asia Physical Education Proprietary School in Fanjiawan, this city, usually trains students extremely seriously, so its results are remarkable. The school's students represented Shanghai in the women's track and field event at this National Games, scoring 64 points, exceeding the three points of Malaya, which won the women's track and field runner-up in the National Games. It is truly amazing to get such a score from one school. The scores in other events such as men's track and field, diving, and women's martial arts are also considerable, totaling more than 108 points. Among them, there are eight who won the championship and five who broke the national record (Jia Lianren's 800 meters, Qian Hangsu's hurdles, Chen Rongtang's discus, Pan Yingchu's softball javelin), and one who created the national record (Meng Jianli's power measurement). The excellent results and high records are particularly commendable. The members of the Shanghai women's basketball team, such as Chen Wanqing, Chen Jinqin, Chen Rongtang, and Xu Yuan, are all students of the school. The women's 400-meter relay race, which was able to break the record in a unique position, also had famous players such as Qian Hangsu and Jiao Yulian participating. The school authorities believe that these students represented Shanghai in this National Games and did not disgrace their mission, which is commendable. The enthusiastic guidance of the teachers is especially appreciated. It is planned to hold a victory celebration on the 26th of this month to make those with excellent results even more motivated, and to make those with less excellent results excited and work hard, and to recognize the great achievements of the enthusiastic guiding teachers.</p>

<h3 id="e148">Let's Turn Over the Basin and Take a Look <a href="#e148" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c148" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">148</a></h3>
<p>— Yang An</p>
<p>Mr. Zhang Boling, the principal of Nankai University, is a leading figure in the education and sports circles of the country. One day, at a banquet held in the International Hotel's domestic goods factory to welcome the female athletes of the National Games, he delivered a wonderful speech promoting domestic goods, which won continuous applause from the audience. Everyone said that this "high-ranking Mr. Zhang" truly has vision, insight, and is willing to work wholeheartedly to promote domestic goods. Mr. Zhang said, "If our goods are not as good as others, we can only feel ashamed and encourage ourselves to make our goods better than others. If our goods are more expensive than others, we can only feel ashamed and strive to make our goods cheaper than others." It is important to know that promoting patriotism through words is not universally applicable in China, where culture is not yet developed. Loving exquisite goods and being greedy for cheapness are human nature, and cannot be changed simply by promoting it verbally. How easy is it to prevent people from buying cheap goods and purchasing exquisite items? Even the clothes I wear now have been carefully considered. Because I couldn't find domestic woolen fabric for my Western-style trousers, I made them from silk fabric, which I think is quite good. It all depends on whether everyone is willing to have some spirit of sacrifice and determination. What is most painful is that the Western word for China comes from the production of porcelain, but now the side dishes in Western restaurants are not Chinese-made. Everyone, turn over the basin and take a look. Is this a Chinese product? Is the tablecloth on the dining table a Chinese product? Is the black tea and milk in the cup a Chinese product? Is the piece of paper a Chinese product? I'm not here to spoil the fun or to blame the hotel owner. This is our common shame. As a country that has produced porcelain for thousands of years, we don't even use our own dining basins. Whose fault is this? Whose responsibility is this? Everyone already knows that promoting domestic goods and building up physical fitness are both ways to revitalize the nation. Everyone has a responsibility. If everyone strives to use domestic goods and manufacture domestic goods from now on, perhaps we won't see a single foreign product at the next welcome party. Only then will I not have wasted my words today." Mr. Zhang was sincere and earnest, and everyone was moved. They believed that this was a thorough and heartfelt speech. I hope everyone will chew on it and reflect on it. Compared to empty slogans and commotion, it might be more effective.</p>
<h3 id="e149">The Alarm That "Rice" Accounts for the Top Spot in the Customs Import Surplus <a href="#e149" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c149" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">149</a></h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>Clothing, food, housing, and transportation are the four essential elements of people's livelihood! In ancient times, the saying "the people regard food as heaven" was well-known to everyone. Farmers, who account for more than 80% of the country's total population, are still unable to be self-sufficient in food and rely on others! This is truly a painful thing!</p>
<p>Amidst the enthusiastic calls for promoting domestic goods, we read the report from the International Trade Bureau to the Ministry of Industry regarding the international trade situation in the first half of the year. What is saddening is that "the total value of foreign goods imported in the first half of the year is estimated at 288,736,000 gold units. Due to the low gold price, although it has decreased compared to the same period last year when calculated in national currency, it has increased by 7% when calculated in gold units. Among them, the import with the greatest value is - rice - totaling 11,186,960 quintals, worth over 43,359,000 gold units." The conclusion is that "China's imported goods have always been cotton, hardware, rice, kerosene, and wheat, with very little change. In the first half of this year, except for kerosene, which decreased, rice, cotton, hardware, and wheat remained the four major pillars of imports. In China, where industry is not yet developed, the import of hardware is not surprising, but the import of agricultural products is so huge that it is the greatest crisis in our foreign trade."</p>
<p>When we see the above figures for "rice" imports and the conclusion, we are truly startled and frightened!</p>
<p>The confrontation between Britain and Italy is escalating, and the prospect of a second world war is imminent! Looking back at our national defense situation, what is it like? What is the state of the national economy? What about agricultural production? Then I dare to shout loudly, we are just waiting to die! Isn't that so? In terms of national defense, there are no strategic fortifications, no modern military equipment! As for the national economy, floods are everywhere, and hundreds of thousands of people are affected by disasters. In terms of agricultural production, fields are submerged! In areas where rice and paddy crops are abundant, there has been a sudden outbreak of white planthopper pests, and all efforts have been in vain! If there is no foreign rice to provide relief, starvation will inevitably ensue! However, if our ports are once blockaded due to a world war, the situation of fish in a pot will be complete, and what is left but to perish?</p>
<p>Therefore, the "rice" problem should be addressed quickly in agriculture by preparing for a rainy day. In areas with good harvests, we should quickly prevent pests. In submerged fields, we should urgently dredge and improve water conservancy to turn barren land into fertile land! Cultivating domestic rice and promoting domestic rice is an urgent and unavoidable matter in promoting domestic goods! I look forward to it! Wang Shouqiu</p>

<h3 id="e151">Bleaching Method of Straw Pulp (Part 1) <a href="#e151" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c151" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">151</a></h3>
<p>— Tianxu Wo Sheng</p>
<p>I was visited by Mr. Jin Runxiang and Mr. Zhu Mei of the Minfeng Paper Mill, who inquired about the cost of making newspaper from straw. I hereby record the outline as follows:</p>
<p>Mr. Zhu described the process: Initially, 13% solid caustic soda was used to digest straw, with each digester holding 80 dan (a unit of weight) and requiring 12 hours. Later, 10% lime was used for 4 hours, the straw was taken out and washed, then put back into the digester and 13% liquid caustic soda was used for 4 hours. After pulping and bleaching, the cost of materials per 100 catties of paper was calculated at 5.9 yuan, which is about 100 yuan per ton or 4.5 fen per pound. For ordinary newspaper, each ream of 37 pounds would cost about 1.7 yuan in materials. Adding the papermaking process, it is impossible to compete with imported products in terms of price. If not bleached, each ton of straw pulp would require 40 dan of straw. Boiling with lime to dissolve and bleaching the yellow water into pulp would only cost 24 yuan. Therefore, the difficulty lies in the bleaching aspect, etc. Therefore, I will briefly describe what I have experienced as follows:</p>
<p>Making pulp from straw is actually more than three to one. Considering buying straw in the city, it costs about 3 yuan per 1,000 catties. 10 pounds of sodium sulfide should be used, costing about 6 jiao. The initial pulp yield is about 400 catties, so 30 pounds of sodium sulfite should be used, costing about 3.9 yuan, and 8 pounds of hydrochloric acid, costing about 4 jiao 8 fen. Adding the above together, multiplying by five to make one ton, it costs only 39.9 yuan. The actual cost of coal and electricity is no more than 6.75 yuan, so the cost is at most 50 yuan. Each pound costs 2.5 fen, and ordinary newspaper costs less than 1 yuan per 37-pound ream. Adding the cost of the papermaking process, even with double shifts, it is at most 1 yuan. If each ream earns 2 jiao, it is also considerable. However, the procedure should be divided into three steps. Turning straw into pulp using sodium sulfide and lime does not add much cost. However, using lime takes a long time. If operating in the countryside, it is not a problem. If operating in a factory, time is valuable and space is costly, so speed is economical. The purpose of using sodium sulfide is to convert the starch into sugar liquid, making it easier to decompose and prevent it from becoming paste. Therefore, steaming for three hours is sufficient to remove the pulp. Although the amount of the mixture is as mentioned above, using pounds per catty, it accounts for 10/1000, but the amount of dilution has a significant impact on the finished product. If it is too strong, more straw will adhere to it and cause it to rot. Therefore, it is advisable to dissolve it with an appropriate amount of water first, so that the straw stalks are moistened.</p>
<p>As mentioned above, the yield of the first step is actually more than 40%. If only the yellow water is bleached from each 100 catties of straw, more than 60 catties can be obtained after drying. However, after pulping with a beater and performing the bleaching process, the yield is greatly reduced, and only 40 catties can be obtained. If the work is not done carefully, the amount of loss cannot be generalized. For example, if steaming is excessive, more of it will become paste, which will escape from the mesh during beating and washing. Therefore, using five times the amount as a ton is actually the minimum, as 4,000 catties of straw are needed to make one ton of pulp. If 2,000 catties of pulp are bleached into one ton, it contains only 80%, depending on the skill of the operator, which should not have major deviations. No work can be done solely based on words, as words are like medicine in a prescription, only showing a standard. For example, when cooking rice, the method is shown, with a certain amount of rice, a certain amount of water, and a certain cooking time, but the result often fails, either cooking into porridge or burnt rice, which is not consistent. Therefore, the bleaching process cannot be handled by rural farmers, and should be done by the factory.</p>
<p>There is more than one type of sodium sulfite. It is advisable to use "acidic sodium sulfite," also known as "sodium bisulfite," with the formula Na2HSO3. The commonly sold sodium sulfite is not acidic, with the formula NaSO3, and is not suitable for use. The effect of bleaching is the opposite of bleaching with "calcium hypochlorite." The effect of sodium sulfite is to remove oxygen from the material to decolorize it, while the effect of calcium hypochlorite is to release oxygen and acidify the material to decolorize it. Therefore, the finished products are equal, but the effects are different. Because the cost is low, those who use it to make newspapers only need to use sulfite bleaching and do not need to use hypochlorite bleaching. However, its drawback is that it easily absorbs oxygen from the air and turns yellow over time. Therefore, imported newspaper inevitably turns yellow over time. The shortcoming of sulfite wood pulp is this, while its advantage is that the cost is lower. If hypochlorite bleaching is used, the amount must be doubled, and the amount of hydrochloric acid must be doubled to sulfuric acid, and the time required is also doubled, so the cost is increased, which is not cost-effective for use in newspapers.</p>
<h3 id="e152">Worth Promoting: Rayon Made from Sorghum Straw <a href="#e152" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c152" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">152</a></h3>
<p>— Zhao</p>
<p>Those who suddenly see my title will surely say, "Why are you so ignorant? And mistake imported rayon for domestic goods? Why don't you think more before writing?" The reporter says that imported goods are what we learn from. Just like today's automobiles and steamships, transportation tools, aren't they all derived from the boats and carriages first invented by our Yellow Emperor? Now, there is rayon made from domestic sorghum straw! How can we not be happy? I deeply hope that Ms. Feng Yunhe, who is determined to succeed, will achieve her goal!</p>
<p>Qingdao Correspondence: Ms. Feng Yunhe is from Lijin, Shandong. She graduated from the National Peiping Women's Normal University. In 1926, she was sent to the United States by the Shandong Provincial Department of Education to study industrial chemistry at Ohio University. She graduated in 1933 and obtained a doctorate. She then went to Germany to study printing and dyeing. Because she was heartbroken by the huge amount and value of rayon imported into China, she was eager to find a way to reverse this profit. Therefore, she worked hard to research the use of abundant and low-value plants produced in China to manufacture rayon. This spring, she successfully tested rayon made from sorghum straw. Compared with imported products, the test properties were even better. Currently, Ms. Feng is studying silk-making machines at the Kahn Meinz factory and will soon return to China to raise funds to set up a factory in Qingdao or Jinan, etc.</p>
<p>Sorghum is different from glutinous rice. Sticky sorghum can be used to make wine. In the north, sorghum is commonly called "shushu," and there are red and white varieties. Cui Bao's "Notes on Ancient and Modern Times" states that sorghum is glutinous rice, etc. "Jie" sounds the same as "jie," meaning the stalks of grain after removing the skin. In the north, sorghum stalks are called "shushu jie," which is used in river engineering (from the Dictionary of Origins). In 1934, customs statistics showed that imports of rayon reached 19,050,000 taels, which is shocking! Rayon is mixed into domestic silk fabrics almost everywhere! Even in remote rural areas, it is ubiquitous! What is most painful is that even the female workers who work hard in domestic factories to manufacture domestic goods often unknowingly wear cheap and beautiful imported rayon! The same is true for women in towns and villages!</p>
<p>Now, the entire country is uneasy about the deflation after the silver rush and worries that China's monetary system will be linked to the gold pound, the US dollar, or the Japanese yen! I don't know that China's customs import surplus has been tens of thousands of yuan every year, and it has long been linked to the gold pound, the US dollar, or the Japanese yen, and it has already dug its own grave! The expansion of rayon to the point of being linked to the clothing of villagers is just one example! The reporter hopes that the entire country and financial giants will quickly work together to support Ms. Feng's domestic straw-made rayon factory to achieve its early success!</p>
<h3 id="e153">Writing to Overseas Students <a href="#e153" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c153" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">153</a></h3>
<p>— Quan Jia</p>
<p>Overseas students must read newspapers every day. You probably can't help but notice the large-print headlines in the news columns that frequently mention the amount of the import surplus! At times, I believe that when you try domestic goods, you often resent that Chinese products are so disappointing. Now, you have left your homeland for a long time to study abroad. In the current time of national economic depression, overseas students may be the only beacon of light! Therefore, I would like to offer a few words of contribution with the hope that overseas students will work hard to promote domestic goods!</p>
<p>(1) Be a model of using domestic goods. In the country, we see that almost all foreigners use their own national goods. I remember one gentleman saying that a Japanese family living in Hongkou used, ate, and wore everything sent from their homeland. One day, that gentleman went to that family's house and saw that they were only eating pickled radishes and the like. He asked him why he was so frugal today, since he used to eat meat and fish regularly. The Japanese person said, "My national goods haven't arrived yet!" Overseas students, due to practical difficulties, cannot do what that Japanese person does. However, daily necessities or clothing should be selected from domestic goods. You should know that wearing domestic clothes on the streets of a foreign country is very glorious. Chinese students mostly spend a lot of money to buy foreign goods and make them into expensive clothes, and foreigners often laugh at the fact that Chinese people don't have their own clothes. Overseas students should take an oath: "If I don't wear Chinese clothes, I would rather never eat a meal or drink a cup of tea!" When a comrade uses Chinese goods, overseas students should all shout in unison: "Me!"</p>
<p>(2) Strive to promote and introduce Chinese goods. The first reason why Chinese goods often cannot gain a foothold abroad is that there is no promotion. The second reason is the counter-promotion of the other party. I believe that overseas students have a wide range of friends abroad. Please try to promote and introduce the advantages of Chinese goods so that your friends develop a concept of trusting Chinese goods. Recently, there have been organizations such as overseas trade groups. If we add the efforts of overseas students to promote them, the results will be great.</p>
<p>(3) Invent and improve on your own. Overseas students are all intellectuals. Naturally, you have the ability to improve the areas of domestic goods that you are dissatisfied with. Please have an interest in inventing or improving domestic goods, which is also very important.</p>
<p>In short, overseas students are also a type of student. This year is the year of domestic goods for students. Overseas students should take the lead and assume the mission of the year of domestic goods for students. Don't be blinded by the prosperity of overseas countries and forget the weak and powerless Chinese national industry. Overseas students in today's extraordinary era can no longer be casual. Please give us good news from the domestic goods industry before you return to China. That is my hope!</p>

<p>— Ji'an</p>
<p>Who in City S doesn't know that Mr. Huang is a domestic goods doctor who is determined to use domestic goods?</p>
<p>Indeed, Mr. Huang is truly an authentic domestic goods doctor. Mr. Huang is truly a believer in using domestic goods. He would rather abandon anything he uses, eats, wears, or any other necessities if they are not domestic goods. Even if he accidentally misused foreign goods due to a moment of carelessness, he would always remember it, express twelve points of regret, and deeply resent the clerk who deceived him.</p>
<p>Mr. Huang is not only very serious about his personal use of domestic goods, but he is also exceptionally enthusiastic about the movement to promote domestic goods. Therefore, no matter what domestic goods promotion association, ×× domestic goods association, he seems to be the licorice in the medicine, and he participates in all of them. Whenever there is a meeting, he must also take the stage to give a speech, talking at length about his way of promoting domestic goods. As a result, Mr. Huang was elected as a member and ×× chairman of the ×× domestic goods association. At first, he always expressed that he was unable to bear the burden of the general public's recommendations, but in the end, for the sake of the domestic goods movement, he had no choice but to accept the position after repeatedly declining.</p>
<p>He strongly opposes people wearing suits, leather shoes, eating Western food, and riding in cars. Those who don't know him scold him behind his back, saying that he is unpatriotic and a would-be slave. Those who do know him, Mr. Huang teaches them honestly and unceremoniously to their faces, saying things like "Propriety, righteousness, integrity, and a sense of shame are the four pillars of a country! What kind of system is it to combine Chinese and Western styles?" He rambles on and on, making the other person feel very uncomfortable, often blushing and retreating meekly.</p>
<p>Therefore, everyone calls Mr. Huang a domestic goods doctor. Mr. Huang is also happily complacent. Although the title of "domestic goods" has not been heard of among the titles of doctors, our Mr. Huang is now unanimously recognized as a domestic goods doctor.</p>

<h3 id="e156">Finance A Chorus of Buying, Gold Price Nearing 1,000 Yuan, Major Players Chasing Purchases, Shorts Desperate, Peak Reached 997.9 Yuan, Result: Soared by 22.7 Yuan <a href="#e156" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c156" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">156</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a historic surge. Those who sold long positions the previous day rushed to buy back in. Speculation about domestic finance was rife, and sentiment was inherently bullish. Sellers disappeared from the market, and the atmosphere was one of universal buying, with a strong sense that the price would break through the 1,000 yuan barrier. The price soared to a high of 997.9 yuan before supply became available, the Hong Kong market eased, and the local exchange market turned flat due to bank sales, leading to a pullback. However, the final trend remained bullish. Early in the morning, overseas silver markets saw declines in London and stability in the U.S. The forward silver price in Menterie fell by 7 hao to 2 li. Exchange rates rose slightly, and London gold rose by 2 pence. The pre-market trading opened higher at 73 yuan, but there was a lack of long supply, and shorts were frightened. Buying momentum quickly built, with major players such as Shen Feng chasing purchases. Suppliers in the market were at a loss, and the price rose step by step to 86 or 87 yuan before Hengyu and others took advantage of the high price to supply, bringing it down to 81 or 82 yuan. Fuxing, Yongda, and Decheng continued to buy, and the price rose again to 85 or 86 yuan. After the high opening in the morning, the Central Bank announced its exchange rates, with both the British and U.S. rates declining. The customs gold unit surged by 3 cents, and the standard gold price was quoted at 960.8 yuan, remaining firm. However, major players took advantage of the high price to sell bars, and banks also offered supply, leading to a reversal. The price retreated to around 80 yuan for a time. Upon learning that HSBC's exchange rates had declined by 0.25 for the British pound and 0.5625 for the U.S. dollar, traders became active at the low price, pushing the price back up. Subsequently, Chinese merchants, such as those from Guangdong, all bought U.S. dollars. Banks' willingness to sell was weak, and the trading was extremely tight. Rumors circulated that customs gold bonds would be issued at a rate of 2.5 national currency yuan per customs gold unit, further boosting sentiment (the actual rate was 1.899 national currency yuan per customs gold unit). The market was entirely dominated by buyers, and sellers largely disappeared, leading to repeated price increases, breaking through the 90 yuan barrier and reaching 997.9 yuan. HSBC's exchange rates also declined by 0.25 and 0.5 yuan. Later, as banks took advantage of the high price to supply and the Hong Kong market gradually hardened, sellers began to appear. The price gradually declined as various exchanges and banks supplied gold, hardening the domestic market and retreating into the 90 yuan range. There was a moment of weakness, but major players continued to buy. It was predicted that Indian silver would decline by 5 annas. The final trend remained firm. The morning market conditions are recorded as follows.</p>

Dada and Hengyu sold, retreating to 1 yuan. Dachen, Hengyu, Fuxing Yong, Fuyu, Futai Yong, and Yongli all bought, rebounding to 5.1 yuan. The Hong Kong market remained loose.

Shen Feng, Dafa Yong, Fuxing Yong, and Hengyu took advantage of the low price to continue taking in, rebounding to 91.3 yuan. Langxian and Huabi supplied November U.S. dollars at 0.0615. Fuxing Yong, Hengyu, Wanxing, Yuqing Yong, Hengxing, Dachen, Huixiang, and others sold bars in succession, gradually falling into the 90 yuan range. Korea supplied December U.S. dollars at 0.75, causing the price to fall to 86 yuan. Huabi bought November U.S. dollars at 0.1875. Shen Feng, Fuxing Yong, Dachen, Hengchang Yong, Dingkang, Hengyu, Lichang, Yuwan, Wanfeng, and Richang replenished their positions in succession. It was predicted that Indian silver would decline by 5 annas, rebounding to 93.5 yuan. Fuxing Yong, Dada, Dachen, Yuqing Yong, and Hengyu continued to sell, retreating to 0.07 yuan. Yongli and Shen Feng, Fuxing Yong maintained the price in succession. The afternoon close rose to 991.5 yuan. After the market closed, Hengyu, Yicheng, Tongtaichang, and Shen Feng sold, bringing the price down to around 90 yuan. Huixiang and Hengyu bought, providing support, and buying was still strong. The price finally rose above 4 yuan.</p>
<p>The closing price, based on the Central Bank's standard gold price, was quoted at 960.8 yuan, roughly 31 yuan weaker than the closing price. It was 8 yuan higher than the previous close. The ledger price for November was 986 yuan, and for December, 992 yuan. The afternoon top-up was 986 yuan. The pure gold price was reduced by 4 yuan to 981.5 yuan. The spot market was even weaker. The gold market soared, and the supply of source silver diminished. Spot houses lacked the appetite to take in gold. Tianjin goods were reduced by another yuan. Refined pure gold added 2 yuan. There was little trading. The switch yesterday was by Yingfeng Heng to Lifeng for 7 bars at 8 yuan, and to Saiyuan Yong for 70 bars, rising even further to 8.5 yuan. Shorts were extremely embarrassed. The November bars were transferred by Hengxing to Yingfeng Heng for 70 bars at 983 yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was chaotic. In summary, Futai Yong, Shen Feng, Yifeng Yong, Yuansheng Yong, Tongtaichang, Yuanmaoyong, Qingfa Yong, Dachang, Xiang Shunmao, Wan Yan Yong, Deshunli, Richang Yongfeng, and Zhaofengchang were on the buying side. Dachen, Fuxing Yong, Hengyu, Chunyuan Yong, Fuyu, Yuanchang Yong, Yongfeng, Jinlong, Yuxinxiang, Renfa Yong, Hengchang Yong, Yongli, Shengda, Yicheng, Qianchang, and Xiang were on the selling side.

Shunli jointly traded over 800, with fewer than 600 netted. The Guangdong group's Hengxing had normal ins and outs. Shengda traded around 200 bars.</p>
<p>Examining the afternoon market conditions, the sentiment among sellers suddenly turned cold. Longs chased in after exiting. The market was filled with buying. The morning opening was 985.5 yuan, and the afternoon close was 91.5 yuan. The highest price was 997.9 yuan, and the lowest price was 980.5 yuan, a fluctuation of 17 yuan and 4 jiao.

<p>Banks Seem Unable to Cope...Result: Both Official and Unofficial Rates are Tight</p>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, London's long-term interest rates were nearly flat, but far-term rates declined by 0.0625. The New York silver market was unmoved.

It was predicted that HSBC's exchange rates would decline by 0.25 for the British pound and 0.5625 for the U.S. dollar, remaining stable. However, Chinese merchants scrambled to settle their accounts, and the process gradually tightened. Banks lacked the appetite to sell, leading to even stronger buying momentum. Chinese, such as those from Guangdong, all scrambled to settle their accounts, putting banks in a difficult position to cope. Rumors spread, and the process became increasingly tight. HSBC's exchange rates changed to declines of 0.25 and 0.5 yuan. This was the tightest moment. Banks took advantage of the high price to sell, stabilizing the situation slightly. The Hong Kong market gradually loosened, and banks supplied settlements in succession, and the process hardened. HSBC and Japanese banks sold, making it difficult to recover. It was predicted that Indian silver would decline by 5 annas. The final trend fluctuated. The afternoon closing selling prices were 1 shilling and 4 pence 0.9375 and 5 pence for the British pound and 34.6875 yuan for the U.S. dollar, indicating that the British pound was tight by 0.3125 and the U.S. dollar was tight by 0.6875 compared to the previous close.

<h3 id="e158">Recent Developments in Ningbo Bank's Long-Term Settlements <a href="#e158" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c158" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">158</a></h3>
<p>The circumstances of the current long-term consolidation, and the various trends in the market, have been reported in this newspaper before. Although there were no large-scale long-term inflows or outflows yesterday, there were still a few. The Daqun Bank has long-term deposits of 500,000 to 600,000 yuan, and long-term loans of slightly over 1 million. According to industry insiders, apart from a slight withdrawal of deposits for other loans, the rest were all rolled over. Only a small amount of loans, slightly over 10,000 yuan, were repaid. Regarding all Ningbo loans, the responsible loan officer in Ningbo said that in the current Shanghai market situation, how easy is it to recover loans? And even if there are reliable people who want to open new accounts, they dare not try easily. The main idea from Ningbo is to recover the loans that can be recovered, and roll over the loans that cannot be recovered. However, Ningbo will not be able to remit current funds to Shanghai again in the future. In short, it will only receive funds and not lend them. According to the reporter's investigation yesterday, 80% to 90% of the Ningbo bank's loan officers have arrived. Only a small number of one or two banks have not arrived, and their loan amount is also very small. As of yesterday, the total amount of Ningbo bank's loans consolidated had already exceeded half, estimated to be over 13 million yuan. The amount of Shanghai bank's renewals is approximately 30 million yuan.</p>
<h3 id="e159">Securities Longs Exit, Bond Prices Fall <a href="#e159" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c159" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">159</a></h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange experienced special ups and downs due to the approaching settlement date. The move by No. 78 to pull up the "Disbandment" bonds was temporarily halted, causing unexpected changes. This was not surprising, but there may be even greater ups and downs. The situation in Europe, due to the Anglo-Italian settlement, is still distant and exceptionally complex. The silver supply in the market suddenly became tight due to the settlement of accounts. In recent days, the longs suddenly became crowded, and those who exited surged. The fluctuations were also significant. There are only two days left for the October futures, and price swings will likely be unavoidable. Viewing the exit of No. 48 and No. 78 in the evening session, the outlook is pessimistic. Yesterday's trading saw a sharp drop at the opening, ranging from a few jiao to over one yuan. Such large fluctuations are common in cases of rapid advance and retreat. No. 16 and North Yarn saw the most selling. In the secondary session, the current month's "Disbandment" bonds plummeted by 1.25 yuan due to No. 78's withdrawal. This clearly showed that the power to manipulate the market had been exhausted. Other bonds only experienced small fluctuations of one or two jiao to three or five jiao. In the afternoon session, sentiment stabilized, and there were still many switch transactions. Only Salt Tax and short-term bonds saw slight declines of one or two jiao. The rest generally recovered by one to three jiao. At the closing, the current month's "Disbandment" bonds recovered by two jiao. Far-term bonds were unchanged. However, due to extremely negative news in the evening newspapers, the market gradually softened. Many bonds fell by five or six jiao. No. 38, No. 48, and No. 78 all saw selling. The North group also sold bonds. The long side was wavering. Those who added fuel to the fire were particularly active. As a result, market prices fell by several jiao to 1.25 yuan. The total transaction volume was 22,251,000 yuan. The results of the price increases and decreases are listed in the table below (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan).</p>

<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (22nd), trading in the New York stock market was extremely active, and prices alternately rose and fell. Public utilities stocks were very strong. Although the reports of the automotive industry were good, the prices fell at the end because longs took profits. It was found that the transactions within two hours of the opening totaled 1,510,000 shares. The backlog of overnight transactions was extremely large. The smooth trading at the opening was only seen since February 10, 1934. Later, selling momentum gradually increased, but public utilities stocks and railway stocks resisted strongly. Bond market and small exchange stocks rose slightly mixed. The daily transaction volume was 2,840,000 shares. The Dow Jones New York indices are listed below.</p>

<p>Gauze Rises by One Yuan Two Jiao Three Fen; Forward Contracts Fetch Five Yuan Foreign Currency</p>
<p>The gauze market continues its upward trend, gold prices soar, morale is high, buyers are active, short covering is rampant, and Chang Feng and Run Kang unexpectedly engage in large-scale purchases, resulting in a tight supply on the trading floor and an increasingly bullish market. However, cautious short sellers remain on the sidelines. The current situation still depends on fluctuations in the premium.</p>
<p>Chang Feng and Run Kang Make Large Purchases of Raw Silk</p>
<p>At the opening of the raw silk market, prices trended upwards uniformly, driven by a surge in the premium. The market sentiment was stirred, and buyers concentrated their efforts. In the second session, news of gold prices nearing the 1,000-yuan mark boosted forward contracts. Large buyers entered the market. Towards the close, some long positions were released, causing a slight pullback. As a result, prices for each month rose by six, eight, and nine jiao compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon session opened with another surge, with reports that the unofficial market after the premium settlement had added two to three yuan. Chang Feng engaged in further purchases, but securities firms sold, keeping prices steady. Consequently, prices for each month rose again by 1.5, 5, 6, and 8 jiao compared to the morning session's close, except for a two-jiao drop for the current month. Sales included 900 bales from Yu Da, 600 bales from Heng Yi, 400 bales from Tong Fu, 550 bales from Da Fu, 2,050 bales from Jin Chang, 900 bales from Zhen Da, 1,250 bales from Sen Kang, 2,200 bales from Heng Chang, and 1,150 bales from Xin Cheng. Purchases included 1,350 bales from Tong Ji, 1,000 bales from Da Feng, 1,450 bales from He Xing, 650 bales from Yi Chang, 4,650 bales from Chang Feng, 2,190 bales from Run Kang, 800 bales from Sheng Yuan, 650 bales from Jia Mang, 550 bales from Shen Ji, and 550 bales from Shen Chang. The highest and lowest exchange rates and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Gauze   Highest Price  Lowest Price  Market Price  Change  Open Interest</p>
<p>October  179.9   178.6   178.6   Up 0.70  16,000</p>

<p>Month  176   177.0   177.2   Up 0.90  26,200</p>
<p>Actual Sales Exceed One Thousand Bales</p>
<p>Current gauze sales are still good. Statistics show that various trading groups purchased a total of 1,117 bales throughout the day. Prices rose by one yuan, and thread prices rose by 2.3 yuan. The purchase amounts for each group were as follows:</p>
<p>Wuhu  10  Anqing  6  Inland  345  Shantou  6</p>
<p>Peers  50  Qisha  70  Jiujiang  5  Guangdong  315</p>
<p>Sichuan 100  Hankou  5  Nanjing  5</p>
<p>The cotton market is experiencing a strong upward trend, with a large number of buyers. This situation is entirely influenced by the sharp rise in cotton and gold prices. Morale is high, retail investors are actively buying, and major players are holding onto their large positions tightly. As a result, the market is exceptionally strong. New highs have been seen in all months for raw cotton futures.</p>
<p>Chang He Covers Shorts Extensively in the Raw Cotton Market</p>
<p>At the opening of the raw cotton market, prices for all months rose steadily. Market sentiment was quite bullish, and buyers flocked in. At one point, the market lacked supply, and the trading floor felt particularly dry. The market advanced step by step, with prices for each month rising by 0.3 to 0.45 yuan compared to the previous day's close. The afternoon session opened with a good market outlook. Due to heavy buying, a certain company made large-scale purchases, and Chang He covered its short positions in significant quantities, leading to a shortage of chips in the market. The premium for tax-included raw cotton is expected to break the 1,000-yuan barrier, so sellers are wary. As a result, prices for each month continued to rise by 0.1 to 0.15 yuan compared to the morning session's close. Sales included 4,800 dan from Zhen Da, 2,200 dan from Tong Fu, 2,200 dan from Yuan Da, 1,300 dan from Sen Kang, 2,200 dan from Tai Chang, 2,600 dan from Sheng Yuan, 4,600 dan from Yong Da, 3,100 dan from Xin Xiang, 1,500 dan from Xin Cheng, 1,400 dan from Heng Chang, and 1,500 dan from Yuan Xing Chang. Purchases included 6,700 dan from Da Fu, 1,000 dan from Mei Ji, 4,300 dan from Tong Ji, 6,500 dan from Chang Feng, 9,600 dan from Chang He, 3,800 dan from Run Kang, 2,600 dan from Yu Da, 3,200 dan from Da Feng, and 4,100 dan from Geng Feng. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are listed below:</p>

<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened higher. Due to good news from Liverpool, all Southern sell orders were absorbed by dealers and Liverpool groups. Prices for all months rose by three to five points. Spot demand was active, and prices were firm. Large quantities of new cotton were taken up by local factories, cotton merchants, and exporters. However, speculative activity was limited pending the Supreme Court's decision. Later, near-term months experienced a slight reaction due to increased selling. Finally, prices recovered on short covering. Spot prices rose 10 points, and futures prices rose 2 to 11 points. British cotton spot prices fell 2 points, and futures prices fell 0.3 points. Indian cotton trading was light. The market was operated by short selling, and brokers bought. Dhollera fell 1.25 rupees, Oomra fell 2 rupees, and Broach fell 2.25 rupees. (Report from 22nd)</p>

<p>After the flour market opened, prices for all months rose uniformly. Although foreign wheat prices were reported to have risen by only a few jiao, the increase in gold prices was significant. With the exchange rate shrinking, the marked price of foreign wheat became even more expensive. Medium and small-sized mills, which had been actively selling in recent days, suddenly stopped, and off-market speculators became active again. Short sellers, panicking, rushed to cover their positions, causing the market to rise steadily. However, some long positions were closed to realize profits, preventing further large price increases. Current flour sales remain weak, but spot transactions are still active.</p>

<p>After the wheat market opened in the morning, the market price increased step by step, as spot wheat mills were active and merchants covered positions they had shorted previously. Then, as gold prices soared again and again, the asking price for spot foreign wheat exceeded 6 yuan. Although the reported price for foreign wheat futures was small, the equivalent price was also high. The buying mood grew stronger in the afternoon, and the upward trend was even more pronounced. The price for January was more than one jiao higher than the previous day's close. There has been no official market for spot wheat for several days. Yesterday, the rising prices of wheat futures and gold had a positive influence, with Shandong wheat opening at 4.5 yuan, Xiangshui wheat at 4.49 yuan, Shahe wheat at 4.45 yuan, and Pukou wheat at 4.435 yuan.

<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday's arrivals were only from about 20 firms (totaling more than 4,000 shi). Because sellers were optimistic, the morning market was quite lively. However, the afternoon market was more sluggish, and bag demand shrank suddenly due to falling prices in Tianjin and the lack of shipping space, with only a few hundred bags moving. Improved milling quality resulted in stable prices for both thick and thin rice. Kiln rice of 100 Ge high quality was slightly better, but medium-grade rice was unaffected. Thick new glutinous rice sold better, with a slight price increase of a few jiao. High-quality Du Yang, and pointy rice sold briskly, and prices also rose a bit. The market for medium-grade rice was flat and lackluster.</p>

<p>(North Shanghai) Arrivals were from more than 40 firms. The morning sales were passable, but afternoon sales were sporadic and sluggish. The market for high-quality new glutinous rice was stable, while medium-grade rice was firm. Broken rice and white rice prices were stable. Kiln rice prices were stable, with 100 Ge rice slightly tighter by a few fen. High-quality Yang Point, Du Point, and Port Point were nearly a jiao tighter, while medium-grade prices were stable. Guest point rice was slightly tighter, and there were no other significant changes.</p>

<p>Although arrivals of foreign xian rice were strong yesterday, local guest rice was even more active. Prices for various types of rice turned firm. Jiangxi rice had fallen slightly the day before, but yesterday local merchants disputed the decline, and 3,500 bags were sold, with prices rebounding by 0.10 yuan. Merchants from Tianjin handled 1,903 bags of Ningbo machine late Huzhou white rice and Liu xian rice, with prices also increasing by 0.03 to 0.04 yuan. Other sales included 171 bags of Ningbo machine early rice, 2,105 bags of Taizhou rice, 1,749 bags of Wenzhou rice, 3,000 bags of Hankou rice, and 210 bags of Shaoxing rice, all handled by local merchants, with prices firm. Total sales in the market were 12,719 bags, with a lively market. Foreign rice had been restricted for several days, but yesterday local demand was strong, and prices were also raised by 0.05 yuan. Sales included 400 bags of Saigon rice, 1,000 bags of Xiao Jiao rice, and 1,600 bags of Siamese broken rice, all handled by local merchants. If sales continue to be strong today and tomorrow, prices will likely improve further.</p>
<p>Foreign Company Throws Open Sesame at Ten Yuan</p>
<p>A foreign company threw open 500 tons of sesame yesterday, priced at 10 yuan for January delivery. It is also rumored that a market price of 10.05 yuan was offered, but it has not been confirmed whether the deal was completed. According to industry insiders, it is bound to be completed. The spot market price is soaring. Total market transactions for various counties were over 3,000 bags. Both new and old soybeans were active. The Dalian Exchange's price of the previous day skyrocketed, causing the market to be suspended. Local morale was high, and sales were even more brisk. Yesterday, Guang, Shan, Fuquan, and local factories uniformly purchased, with a total of over 4,000 bags of various soybeans traded.</p>

<p>Yesterday's sugar market saw a firm upward trend due to rising premiums and customs duties. The Association set the price for spot No. 24 coarse granulated white sugar at 19 yuan, with some transactions, up 0.50 yuan.

<p>Recently, the foreign exchange rate has shrunk, and metal prices have risen again. Tinplate prices increased by 2 yuan to 31 yuan. Co. Steel prices increased by 1.5 yuan to 29.5 yuan. English steel plate prices increased by 1 yuan, with 2.5% selling for 8.5 yuan, 7% for 7 yuan, and 1% for 6.75 yuan. Black iron sheet prices also rose by 0.5 yuan, estimated at 9.25 yuan. In addition, new lead wire, new iron wire, galvanized iron sheet, corrugated iron, and other items have all risen.

<p>Sichuan pickled mustard greens have recently seen an increase of 2 yuan in shipping costs due to the shallow waterways in the production area. The inventory in Shanghai is also depleted due to the long-term lack of arrivals, with only about two to three thousand jars remaining. Yesterday, over a thousand jars were reportedly sold at prices of 11-12 yuan, up 2 yuan from before. However, the increase in price is only enough to offset the shipping costs, and there are still losses based on cost. Further price increases are expected.</p>

<p>— (Huanglian)</p>
<p>"Any soft object, when subjected to pressure from another object, will contract in volume. However, this contraction is temporary, not permanent, because even though it is suppressed by another object, it has not lost its elasticity - resistance.</p>
<p>Therefore, the stronger the external pressure on a soft object, the greater the resistance. If the pressure is small, the resistance will also be weak!"</p>
<p>Furthermore, for example, a rubber ball bounces higher the harder it is thrown, and vice versa.</p>
<p>The above physics is extremely common and known to all. Therefore, we are not worried about the increasing severity of the national crisis - which can be said to be an increase in pressure - because worry is useless. We are only saddened by those who do not know shame and only seek pleasure, those whose minds have become wooden, because "this group" is probably already missing their elasticity - resistance. This is the greatest crisis for China's future!</p>
<h3 id="e171">Betrothal <a href="#e171" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c171" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">171</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Chen Sheng</p>
<p>In the North, children are called "wawa" (娃娃). The "wawa betrothal" (娃娃親事) written about in this article is a peculiar custom in the North, and can also be said to be a special page in the complex history of Chinese marriage.</p>
<p>The reality of "wawa" is like this: the North was later in developing, and the obstinacy of the common people is very profound. The concept of valuing men over women is even more severe. Parents regard male children as extremely precious, while they view female children as worse than dirt. Therefore, in relatively wealthy families, if they have a son late in life, not only is it rarer than anything else, but the first important issue is that when the child is only one or two years old, they quickly spend some money to find a wife for the child who is already of marriageable age to come home. This is considered fulfilling the great responsibility of being a parent.</p>
<p>When the girl arrives at the boy's house, she first greets the in-laws with the etiquette of a child, and regards her husband as a younger brother. So, the obligations that this daughter-in-law must fulfill are like those of a nanny hired by others. She is fully responsible for the diet and daily life of this young husband, dressing and feeding him during the day, and sleeping with him in her arms at night. Moreover, all sewing, cooking, washing, sweeping, and other household chores are the responsibility of this daughter-in-law.</p>
<p>When this young husband grows from a child to a teenager and becomes an adult, a propitious day is chosen to formally hold the wedding ceremony. However, this pair of ideal people consists of a young man of only twenty years and an aging woman. Fundamentally, the wife is one or two decades older than the husband. Such old yin and young yang couples are not surprising in the North.</p>
<p>However, being able to raise her husband to adulthood and actually live together in harmony, this woman, despite having worked hard for more than a decade and wasted her youth, is still considered greatly fortunate. If the young husband dies young, the woman must remain chaste and a widow for the rest of her life. She will also be cursed as a jinx, a husband-killer, and a family destroyer until she dies. This is truly a tragic event in the world, devoid of humanity. This strange custom of "wawa betrothal" is still prevalent in Qingyuan, Guangping, and other counties in Hebei Province.</p>
<h3 id="e172">Night Boat <a href="#e172" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c172" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">172</a></h3>
<p>— Wei Jing</p>
<p>This time, following a friend, I took a night boat and experienced life in the last century again.</p>
<p>Under the moonlight, in a waterway squeezed between sloping hills, it was progressing by the pulling force of four strong men. The sound of water "嘩拉嘩拉" came rhythmically from under the boat. The shore was so quiet that only the barking of dogs and the very eerie hooting of owls came from afar. Otherwise, there were no sounds. The grass on the shore swallowed the feet of those pulling the boat. Sparse tree shadows resembled ghosts, pouncing on the gunwale of the boat. The boat was crowded with people. In the small cabin, there were about forty passengers, men and women, old and young, rustic and beautiful. My friend and I took the small room, which consisted of only two rooms in the entire boat. Although there was only a bunk barely big enough for two people, it was much more comfortable than the three or forty people in the general cabin. Not only could we sit, but we could also stretch our legs and lie down, and we even had a private Mobil lamp.</p>
<p>My friend started snoring as soon as the boat moved. I couldn't fall asleep. At one o'clock in the middle of the night, amidst the mixed snoring in the general cabin, I suddenly heard a sharp scream from a woman. I was startled and poked my head out to take a look. In the dim light of a Mobil lamp, I saw that the passengers who had woken up were all grinning at a woman in her thirties. The woman's face was flushed, and she seemed to want to cry but didn't open her mouth.</p>
<p>At this time, my friend also woke up and said with a smile, "Too common. When I take a night boat, I always see this kind of thing related to moral issues nine out of ten times. Once, um..." He offered me a cigarette, lit it, and we smoked in silence, cutting off the topic.</p>
<p>The sounds in the cabin subsided. The sound of the water under the boat was again "嘩拉嘩拉". The four people pulling the boat, probably to relieve their fatigue, began to hum vulgar mountain songs one after another.</p>

<p>"I wonder if the Old Buddha is happy today?" He first probed Li Lianying.</p>
<p>"Why do you ask that? Let me tell you: the Old Buddha is in the worst mood today!" Li Lianying said arrogantly. "If you have anything to report, no one can guarantee whether she will get angry or not."</p>
<p>"You are right. I don't know whether I will be beaten or scolded after I report this matter. But I dare not not report it," the gardener said with a crying face. "If I don't report it today, and the Old Buddha finds out tomorrow, will I be able to keep my head!"</p>
<p>"Hmph! You have a point! But after you go up and report it, she might get angry, and you still won't be able to avoid having your head chopped off!" Li Lianying laughed coldly as if very pleased. This person was originally a heartless and inhumane creature. Relying on the Empress Dowager's favor, he did not regard these little eunuchs as human beings. Every time a eunuch or palace maid angered the Empress Dowager and was ordered to be dragged out for torture, Li Lianying always showed a look of secret joy in his heart. If the Empress Dowager wanted to have someone arrested and beheaded, he was even more delighted. "Now, tell me what is the matter that you plan to report?"</p>
<p>At this time, the gardener was already scared pale. Hearing Li Lianying's tone, he wanted to stop talking, but he also knew that he had already said too much and could not take it back. Even if he really stopped talking, Li Lianying would definitely use torture to force him to tell the truth. (443)</p>

<p>Episode 20: Struggling for Life to See His Beloved Grandson, Hugging and Crying in a Famine Year, Recalling the Past, Planting Wheat Leads to Disaster</p>
<p>Yueying said that in the past two years, the store still had a little business. But during that year of famine, those passing by were all refugees, and foreign merchants doing business could not be seen for months. If you weren't a local, you wouldn't go into a shop run by someone from Hunan. So my dad closed the shop and stopped doing business, focusing solely on farming. Mrs. Zhou said: Wasn't there a drought? How could farming produce any grain? Yueying said: That's right, in the first year, we didn't harvest any grain at all. We still had some stored grain. The people in the area, because there was no harvest that year, didn't eat things like they used to. They didn't eat pot cakes and steamed buns even once every ten days. They always used flour mixed with water to make a paste to drink. After a while, drinking the thin paste left people feeling weak and powerless, so they could only make pot cakes once or twice, but they had to add wheat bran to the flour. Later, by early spring, even with the addition of wheat bran, it still felt like they were eating too much wheat flour, so they dug up some grass roots from the mountain ridges, chopped them into small pieces, and mixed them with the flour to make food. The amount of flour decreased more and more, and the amount of grass roots increased more and more. Later, what they ate wasn't pot cakes, but grass root dumplings. By the third or fourth month, it still hadn't rained a single drop from the sky. Everyone looked up at the sky all day long, feeling not only sad but also very scared. If there was no more grain on the ground, wouldn't the people in the area all starve to death? So my dad said that if it continued to be dry like this, even grass roots might not be available to eat. There was only one way: to quickly return to our old home in Hunan. But our old home in Hunan was several thousand li away from Gansu. Even if we just ate along the way, it would cost no less than twenty or thirty yuan to get there. So there was only one stupid way: to bring our own dry food and eat it while walking. (247)</p>

<h3 id="e175">The Heroic Woman of France (Part 1) <a href="#e175" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c175" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">175</a></h3>
<p>— Hai</p>
<p>Our country's famous actor, Mei Lanfang, with his God-given handsome features, plays female roles so vividly and realistically. When he performs on stage, every gesture, every movement, every word he utters is feminine, making it almost impossible to tell that he is a man. In recent years, his footsteps have reached Japan, America, and various other countries, and everyone who sees him is delighted and full of praise, hence the title "Heroic Woman." However, offstage, he resumes his male attire and lives his life as a man. It is unheard of that in the era of Louis XV in France, there was a knight who did not perform on stage but dressed as a woman and lived a woman's life for as long as forty years? This is truly a rare and wondrous event that must be recorded.</p>
<p>This heroic woman was the Chevalier d'Eon, who held the position of commander in the heavy cavalry regiment of France. He had a slim and petite physique, was delicate and lively, and possessed a thick head of hair as fine as a beautiful woman's silken tresses. Even more peculiar was that his eyes contained a great deal of tears, ready to flow at any moment. In the court of Louis XV, he was famous for his handsome looks, and thus, entrusted with a diplomatic mission, he was sent to Russia. At that time, the Empress of Russia had always been unwilling to receive French men, and d'Eon was unable to gain an audience, which greatly distressed him. Suddenly, he remembered that he had once dressed as a woman at a costume ball, and he decided to wear women's clothing to seek an audience with the Russian Empress.</p>
<p>He went with a graceful and charming demeanor. Due to his inherent beauty and realistic makeup, there were absolutely no flaws. The Empress's maids all thought he was a French lady-in-waiting and invited him to their dressing rooms to share their private thoughts and secrets, telling him their love stories, unaware that he was actually a bearded man.</p>
<p>Later, he was sent on a secret mission to England. A wealthy family in London held a special welcome party, attended by ambassadors from various countries and lords and nobles, making it a grand occasion. Among the many male and female guests, there was a Countess Daschkova from Russia who recognized d'Eon at first glance. It turned out that she had often interacted with him in St. Petersburg. Now, seeing him suddenly dressed as a man, she was very surprised. Thus, the story of his dressing as a woman in Russia spread.</p>
<p>At that time, the social circles of London were swept up in a gambling frenzy. Everyone put up a lot of money to bet on whether d'Eon was actually a man or a woman, and they gave d'Eon 15,000 gold pounds, demanding that he give the final verdict. He was very angry, and suddenly tears streamed down his face. Blushing, he lowered his eyelashes shyly and said that he was indeed a woman, but he had been dressed as a man since childhood because his parents had no sons, and this was a way to console their feelings. Immediately, people spread this news, and everyone believed it to be true, while d'Eon secretly chuckled in the dark. Tired of London, he wanted to return to his homeland of France.</p>
<p>At this time, the grandson of Louis XV was in power; this young Louis was very humorous. He said that when d'Eon returned to France, if he resumed the attire of a cavalry commander, then he and the Goussy family would have old grievances and would inevitably have to duel and shed blood; therefore, he had to return dressed as a woman—otherwise, his pension would be revoked.</p>
<p>Although this was the young king joking with him, the means were very ruthless. D'Eon had debts in England, which he relied on his pension to cover. Hearing the threat of revocation, how could he not be anxious? Thus, he had no choice but to obey the young king's order. The young king, out of sympathy for his plight, allowed him to wear the Cross of Saint Louis, which he had previously received for his bravery, and kept for him the full set of uniform and military handguns, sabers, bayonets, etc., from his cavalry regiment, as souvenirs.</p>
<p>Upon returning to Paris, he followed the young king's orders and went to a clothing store he had designated, where he had many women's silk dresses and skirts made, and began to dress as a woman. He hesitated for a moment, feeling unbearable in his heart, and cursed, throwing aside the colorful women's clothes and putting on his old regiment uniform again, fleeing to his childhood hometown of Tonnerre, hiding in the vineyards, not daring to show his face. However, after enduring a month, plagued by financial difficulties, he had to return to Paris and, under the name of Mademoiselle de l'Eon, appeared in society.</p>
<p>Brief News: The Great Shanghai People's Society, a publishing organization jointly initiated by reporters from major Shanghai newspapers, has published the bi-monthly news publication "The Great Shanghai People." The inaugural issue was published on October 10th, with an initial print run of 5,000 copies, which have already sold out. Due to insufficient office space at its original location, the Society has recently moved to the Independent Publishing House at No. 5 Chongrang Lane, Sima Road. It is reported that the second issue is scheduled for publication on November 1st, featuring works by Qian Hua, Huang Jiping, Shen Songfang, Lu Yi, Zhu Manhua, Huang Tianpeng, Xu Zhongnian, Xu Weinan, Zhu Yingpeng, Xu Xinqin, Zhang Ruogu, and others. The format and content of the second issue will be even more beautiful and rich than the first, it is said.</p>

<h3 id="e176">Treating Lung Disease and Economics <a href="#e176" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c176" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">176</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>The mental anguish of treating lung disease is greater than the physical pain. The threat to one's finances is especially severe. Therefore, the economic aspect must be fully considered before undergoing treatment. There have been many tragic outcomes due to running out of funds midway through treatment.</p>
<p>The key to economical treatment is not saving on various living expenses during treatment, but rather saving on the overall cost of treatment. In other words, it is to achieve complete recovery as soon as possible. To achieve this goal, one must consult a formal specialist physician, thoroughly implement various therapies, strictly adhere to the doctor's instructions, and persevere in recuperation. In this way, the treatment period can be shortened, resulting in an economical outcome. If the initial treatment is incomplete, prolonging the recovery period, the result will still be uneconomical.</p>
<p>Some say that lung disease is a rich man's disease because treating it requires a great deal of money. This is a misconception. In fact, ordinary living expenses can achieve perfect results in treatment. Therefore, whether or not lung disease treatment can be completed does not depend on the amount of treatment expenses, but rather on whether the patient chooses the right doctor and whether he or she can put in the effort.</p>
<p>Treating lung disease does not necessarily require relocating or staying in a sanatorium. If one can reform one's life at home, with the help of a specialist physician, and carefully implement fundamental treatment methods, perfect results can also be achieved.</p>
<p>Treating lung disease is a kind of protracted war. Do not be misled by the effectiveness of relocating, wasting money, and adding to the financial burden. Therefore, for patients with limited financial resources, it is more advisable to use the money for relocation or hospitalization for long-term home treatment.</p>
<p>For home treatment of lung disease, find a formal specialist physician nearby and attend regular outpatient visits to seek appropriate treatment and strictly adhere to the doctor's instructions. If one can resolve to comply, the effect will be no less than that of hospitalization.</p>
<p>The "Long-Term Treatment Package Fee Method for Lung Disease" established by the Shanghai Municipal Sanatorium is designed for economically disadvantaged families. For mild cases, a package fee of only a few dozen yuan is required to cover medical care until recovery (including medicine, injections, consultation fees, etc.). The aim is to prevent patients from being troubled by economic difficulties, to be able to undergo treatment without worry, and to safely achieve full recovery. This method is truly a good solution to the economic problem of treating lung disease and is a boon for ordinary families.</p>
<h3 id="e177">Treatment of Severe Pulmonary Tuberculosis <a href="#e177" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c177" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">177</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>Although pulmonary tuberculosis is a stubborn disease, it is not incurable. If patients are diagnosed early and seek appropriate treatment in a timely manner, nineteen out of ten can be cured. Unfortunately, the public in our country lacks medical knowledge. When the disease is in its early stages, they do not seek scientific diagnosis and either allow it to go untreated or blindly follow the old doctor's theory of "Yin deficiency and weakness," making one mistake after another until the disease has penetrated to the third stage before they enter the doors of scientific medicine and earnestly seek treatment. Therefore, most of the patients who approach us belong to severe cases, and it is already difficult to help them. However, doctors bear the heavenly responsibility of saving lives and must think of ways to rescue them even when there seems to be no way.</p>
<p>Since 1889, Bruns, Alexander, Kuchard, Moralt, and others have explored the timing of implementing treatment for third-stage pulmonary tuberculosis. If a glucose and camphor solution is administered by intravenous injection (once a day), and "Lung Vital" Phith Weal is taken internally three times a day, two tablespoons each time, it can transform progressive cases into static cases and exudative cases into sclerotic cases. After undergoing this treatment, patients with pulmonary tuberculosis can easily expectorate phlegm, their shortness of breath is relieved, night sweats cease, their appetite increases, their fever gradually decreases, and their spirits feel very refreshed, often achieving astonishing results.</p>
<p>The prognosis of severe pulmonary tuberculosis cannot be predicted, but if this method is adopted when all other methods have been exhausted, there may be a glimmer of hope for a cure. There is one more point that must be mentioned: this treatment cannot achieve its full effect unless it is continued for more than three months. Patients should persevere in carrying it out. If it is interrupted from time to time or stopped halfway, all previous efforts will be wasted, and there will be no hope of recovery. Patients, please pay attention to this.</p>
<h3 id="e178">Clinical Application of Male Gonadal Hormone Preparations <a href="#e178" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c178" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">178</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Jiang Guanqun</p>
<p>The use of organ therapy among the people has a long history. According to folk legends and historical records, there have been many instances since ancient times of treating diseases with the organs and even excrement of animals or humans. However, these practices were passed down and used without any scientific explanation, and this excellent therapy has not been formally applied in the field of treatment. Therefore, despite having thousands of years of history, it has made no progress. It was not until Claude Bernard began to open the door to endocrinology with modern scientific research that organ therapy began to take shape. The results of his research showed that glandular organs, in addition to ordinary secretion, constantly produce unique substances and transport them into the blood, which is called internal secretion. Later, in 1888, Brown-Sequard continued Bernard's research and made even more progress. He used testicular extracts in repeated experiments and came to the following conclusion: "Extracting the internal secretions of the testicles can enhance the physiological functions of the animal body, restore the atrophy of the reproductive organs, increase appetite, and invigorate energy." Thus, so-called organ therapy was achieved.</p>
<p>Regarding the clinical indications for male gonadal hormones, according to modern scholars, the following are generally true:</p>
<p>(A) For neurasthenia, especially reproductive neurasthenia, such as impotence, decreased erectile ability, premature ejaculation, spermatorrhea, and lack of pleasure.</p>
<p>(B) Conditions with metabolic dysfunction, cardiac decompensation, general wasting and weakness, and premature aging.</p>
<p>There are many types of male gonadal hormone preparations, and their effects vary. In clinical application, the German-made "Well Tonic" is highly recommended by the medical community as the most effective.</p>
<p>According to my experience, patients with neurasthenia experience relief from various nervous ailments after taking "Well Tonic." After ten to fifteen days of continuous use, symptoms such as listlessness, fatigue, sleep disturbances, and loss of appetite are reversed. For patients with reproductive neurasthenia, strict adherence to health maintenance, prohibition of sexual activity, and daily consumption of "Well Tonic" have yielded unexpected results in over fifty cases. Patients feel refreshed, have no more insomnia, back pain, palpitations, forgetfulness, spermatorrhea, or impotence, and these symptoms disappear one after another.</p>
<p>The above is my recent experiment, and its efficacy far exceeds that of all other hormone preparations. I dare to record it in this publication for your reference and introduction.</p>
<h3 id="e179">"Menorrin" for Women <a href="#e179" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c179" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">179</a></h3>
<p>— Dr. He Zexian, Obstetrician at Hongkou Maternity Hospital</p>
<p>In our clinical practice, we often see women who are prone to depression and like to take medicine. They believe that they are terminally ill and spend their days in a state of anxiety. When asked about their ailments, they claim to have illnesses all over their bodies but cannot explain them. Their common symptoms include headaches, fatigue, back pain, fear of cold, insomnia, loss of appetite, mood swings, suspicion, excessive dreaming, anxiety, forgetfulness, and irritability. Upon closer examination, the cause is often menstrual irregularities.</p>
<p>Menstrual irregularity is the most common disease in gynecology. Therefore, menstrual regulating drugs are also an indispensable pharmaceutical in gynecology. Although there are many kinds of drugs in the market. However, in practice, the efficacy that we expect from theory is also very rare. Even if there are one or two good products, they are too expensive to be attempted.</p>
<p>Recently, the "Menorrin" is exclusively managed by the Meilindeng Drug Store. It is based on experienced prescriptions from well-known Chinese and Western gynecology hospitals. It is a collection of dozens of precious medicines for regulating menstruation, nourishing blood, and strengthening the uterus. It is also made with the essence of "Danggui," a famous gynecological medicine promoted since ancient times in our country. It has extraordinarily effective for the symptoms caused by menstrual irregularities, such as abdominal pain during menstruation, amenorrhea, excessive or insufficient menstrual flow, back pain, leucorrhea, uterine coldness, and infertility.</p>
<p>Since I have been applying Menorrin clinically, I have been able to easily solve the nervous breakdown and menstrual irregularities of women whom I have always considered difficult to treat. Even distant relatives live in other villages, and their wives write to me for inquiries. Then I recommend them to take "Menorrin", and they write back to thank me in less than a month. If you apply this agent, you need to be patient and take several bottles. You can't do what you want quickly. The effects of this Menorrin is unexceptional. Our country is full of women who suffer from lack of Qi and blood and disease. It is closely related to health. It's like adding a health insurance for women.</p>
<h3 id="e180">Recent Advances in Oral Medications for Lung Disease <a href="#e180" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c180" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">180</a></h3>
<p>— Physician Shen Zhaoquan</p>
<p>There are truly many oral medications for treating tuberculosis these days. The number is overwhelming, and it is impossible to count them all. However, when used in clinical experiments, those that can achieve satisfactory results are very rare. As for the drugs advertised, although their efficacy is vigorously promoted, in reality, they are completely ineffective and only cause harm. Sometimes, they may stop coughing, but this is due to the sedative they contain, and they have no radical cure effect. Moreover, the ingredients in oral medications for lung disease have always been nothing more than guaiacol, calcium, phosphorus, cod liver oil, and the like. These drugs may only be effective for a short time, or they may only be suitable for the initial stages, or they may upset the stomach if taken too much, or they cannot be stopped after long-term use. In short, they are not radical cures for lung disease.</p>
<p>Recently, there is "Lung Vital" Phith Weal, which I consider to be the leader among oral medications for pulmonary tuberculosis. Although it cannot be said to have special effects, it can be regarded as the giant among oral therapy drugs. According to reports from European and American scholars and experiments by doctors in various countries, it has been confirmed as the safest and most effective oral treatment for lung disease today. "Lung Vital" Phith Weal must occupy the top spot. This product is made from the effective ingredients extracted from the fresh lungs and spleens of mammals. It has a direct effect on lung lesions, filling in their defects and harmonizing and maintaining their function. At the same time, it builds a solid wall of connective tissue around the lesions, causing them to harden and promoting the formation of scars, completely wrapping the evil tuberculosis bacteria and causing them to self-destruct. Moreover, these effective ingredients of the lungs and spleen also promote blood coagulation, so the effect of "Lung Vital" Phith Weal in preventing bleeding (hemoptysis) is particularly remarkable.</p>
<p>In addition to the components of the lungs and spleen as the main ingredient, "Lung Vital" Phith Weal also contains lecithin (i.e., lipids) and other nourishing and strengthening drugs. Therefore, after use, it can produce blood and build muscle, making the body strong, restoring the gradually lost life functions, increasing the natural resistance to disease, allowing patients to quickly recover from illness, and healing in a very short period of time. The ancients said, "A good doctor treats the disease before it occurs." People who suffer from neurasthenia and physical weakness are most likely to develop tuberculosis. Taking "Lung Vital" Phith Weal can make the body healthy and strong and increase the resistance to infection. Therefore, those who take this medicine can "treat tuberculosis if they have it" and "improve their health and prevent lung disease if they do not have it." It has the function of preventing and treating both.</p>
<p>Since I have been applying "Lung Vital" Phith Weal clinically, I have treated hundreds of cases of pulmonary tuberculosis in various stages, and all have achieved unexpected results. In general, mild cases are cured in one month, and severe cases are cured in no more than two or three months. Everything goes smoothly, and the medicine cures the disease. It is indeed the champion among oral medications for lung disease. Now I will briefly describe the results of the application of this medicine below.</p>
<p>(1) After using this medicine, its effective ingredients are absorbed, surround the lesions of tuberculosis, and build a solid wall of connective tissue, preventing the spread of microorganisms. Moreover, the microorganisms gradually die due to lack of nutrition. As a result, chills, fever, cough, hemoptysis, and all other symptoms are quickly reduced.</p>
<p>(2) After taking it continuously for several weeks, the face becomes rosy, the spirit is full, and one is no longer as listless as before.</p>
<p>(3) The ingredients contained in "Lung Vital" Phith Weal, in addition to lung preparations, also include lecithin, liver gland hormones, testicular gland hormones, and other precious products that produce sperm and replenish blood. Therefore, although patients take only "Lung Vital," the benefits they obtain are better than using several kinds of medicines, which is economical.</p>
<p>(4) The taste is sweet and easy to take, and even women and children are happy to use it and take it frequently. The appetite is naturally stimulated, and the body becomes healthier day by day. "Lung Vital" is an organ preparation that does not contain any harmful chemical substances. Therefore, even if it is taken year after year, there are no adverse effects.</p>
<p>"Lung Vital" has such satisfactory results that it is by no means comparable to ordinary drugs for treating lung disease. I will say a few words to tell the patients at home and abroad.</p>
<h3 id="e181">Common Sense for Choosing Tonics <a href="#e181" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c181" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">181</a></h3>
<p>— Gao Baorui</p>
<p>Since ancient times in our country, the concept of tonics has been deeply ingrained in people's minds. Therefore, the need for tonics is particularly high. Just look at the patients who seek medical attention, they always ask whether there are any tonics to take, which is enough to give you an idea.</p>
<p>When patients ask if there are any tonics, if we doctors do not have a reasonable response, they will inevitably become suspicious and say that we do not know about tonics. Therefore, such a response may be related to credibility. However, if we want to respond, there is actually nothing to recommend. Although there are countless kinds of tonics sold on the market, both injectable and oral, after trying them, there are very few drugs that are effective. So when patients ask about tonics, the result is still better to just recommend cod liver oil.</p>
<p>Cod liver oil is indeed good for the human body. However, if we only recommend cod liver oil, patients will think that doctors only know about cod liver oil. They are often not satisfied, and there are other good tonics besides cod liver oil.</p>
<p>The word "tonic" means that it can replenish what the body lacks. In other words, it can provide what the body needs. If we examine the ingredients that the human body needs, protein is the most important, followed by carbohydrates and fats. As for other inorganic salts and vitamins, the need is very small. The daily intake of food is enough to absorb and use them, so there is no need to supplement them unless it is a special occasion.</p>
<p>The needs of the human body are as such, but the so-called tonics sold in the market are the opposite. They mostly contain only a small amount of phosphorus, arsenic, iron, calcium, iodine, and the like, which actually do nothing. Therefore, repeated experiments have repeatedly failed, until doctors are at a loss and patients are desperate, believing that there are no tonics in the world.</p>
<p>In our lives, the components of our bodies are constantly being consumed. Therefore, if we do not think about continuing to live, then that is it. But if we want to continue to live, we must constantly replenish what is being consumed. However, healthy people can replenish what is being consumed from the food they eat every day and do not need to seek additional supplements. But people who are sick and weak, such as those with "consumptive diseases like tuberculosis" and "neurasthenia," cannot exert their inherent functions. Therefore, even if they eat a lot of nutritious food, such as fish, meat, chicken eggs, milk, vegetables, and fruits, what if they cannot digest it?</p>
<p>Moreover, among the various nutrients, such as carbohydrates, fats, inorganic salts, and vitamins, the digestion is relatively simple. Therefore, they can still get a considerable supplement from ordinary food. But protein can only be absorbed after the most laborious and complex digestion, resulting in the final product, "amino acids." Otherwise, there is no way to absorb it. Then, is it not difficult for people with weak stomachs and intestines to seek protein supplements from their daily food?</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the blood-tonifying, strengthening, and nourishing "Vonbour's San-Vita-Cell," which is the final digested product of protein, namely, the "amino acid" preparation. In other words, it is the essence of protein that has been artificially digested. After taking it, it can form muscles and produce blood. Even patients with poor stomachs and intestines who are unable to digest and absorb food can maintain nutrition through this. Therefore, from all aspects, I think that "Conbour's San-Vita-Cell" is a very ideal nourishing and strengthening agent.</p>
<p>The point of view of "Conbour's San-Vita-Cell" in manufacturing is as such. Recently, I have also conducted clinical experiments, and it is in line with the facts. Everyone I have recommended it to has said that it is effective. Alas! At this time when doctors and patients are both having difficulty finding tonics, such a good medicine has been discovered. That is why I cannot remain silent and speechless.</p>

<h3 id="e182">The Era Following "Ah Q" <a href="#e182" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c182" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">182</a></h3>
<p>— Yu Congyu</p>
<p>We lack the spirit to bear heavy burdens and travel far, and we lack the drive to work hard with our heads bowed. In the past, those who looked favorably upon the Chinese people called them a sleeping lion. China seemed quite pleased to consider itself a sleeping lion. But what is a sleeping lion like? A sleeping lion is, after all, not a dead lion. It is merely sleeping there. The lion's strength and vigor have not disappeared, and the small animals scurrying around it are only daring to make trouble secretly, not daring to eat its flesh. Moreover, they ultimately fear it will awaken.</p>
<p>However, regarding China as a sleeping lion was before the Eight-Nation Alliance. Later, the Western illusion was shattered, and a dead lion was mistaken for a sleeping lion.</p>
<p>But we do not admit that we are dead. We say we are merely taking a nap. "Be careful, friends, when we wake up, we will repay kindness with kindness and revenge with revenge!" Thus, China stirred. Publications such as "Awakened Lion" and "Lion's Roar" came into being, but these were merely the names of publications.</p>
<p>This was the May Fourth Era. At that time, everyone seemed to think you were not dead, but after scratching yourself, you fell asleep again. During the Northern Expedition Era, you seemed to wake up again, and everyone seemed to think you were not dead, but after smacking your lips, you fell asleep again.</p>
<p>So people concluded that even if you were not a dead lion, perhaps you were a living donkey. I remember Liu Zihou's story of the donkey in Guizhou. It seems to have accurately described the present situation hundreds of years later. The tiger sees that the donkey can only use its tail to drive away mosquitoes and flies, so it really comes to bite us to test it.</p>
<p>Thus, everyone realized that pretending to be a sleeping lion was useless. We were not lions to begin with, and it would be too ridiculous to wake up and become a lion, to roar with a lion's voice. So everyone shouted again: We must be camels, camels!</p>
<p>What is a camel? A camel is not impatient, not agitated, not afraid of hardship, holding its head high, keeping its heart low, looking at the bottomless desert, carrying an astonishing weight, not wanting to slack off, not caring about the scenery, not greedy for flowers and fruits, and not stopping until it reaches its destination. This is naturally correct. China's present state is just the starting point, the future is a bottomless desert, and the responsibility is an astonishing load. One must have the spirit of a camel. If one only wants to roar and become a lion to repel enemies from afar, or to raise a finger and become a flying knife to kill enemies from thousands of miles away, that would be just a strange dream, even when it turns into the feces in other people's intestines.</p>
<p>But how can we become camels? To see if China can become a camel, we must ask what China is actually like now. But this question has always been ignored. People mistakenly thought we were a sleeping lion, so we forgot that we were mice, and wanted to wake up and become a lion, and wanted to roar like a lion for people to hear. This has already led to running into walls and making a fool of ourselves everywhere. But if we see real camels reaching their destination, and we ignore the fact that we are mice, then isn't it also a dream to disguise ourselves as camels and try to carry the weight of a camel and walk the journey of a camel? — Therefore, we need a mirror. If we don't have a mirror, we should look at our reflection in the pond to see what we really are.</p>
<p>Ah Q represents the Chinese people, but after being beaten, Ah Q would also say, "The grandson is beating the grandfather." Now it seems that the era of Ah Q is over, because we haven't seen this kind of donkey-like ability for a long time. I seem to only see my family's "Ami."</p>
<p>"Ami" is our family cat. When she is pushed off the sofa, she happily plays with the yarn ball on the floor. If she is not allowed to play with the yarn ball, then she plays with her own tail—equally happy, joyful, and carefree!</p>
<h3 id="e183">Natural Description (Part Two) <a href="#e183" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c183" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">183</a></h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>The nature depicted in these poems is all proper. This is because Du Fu focuses on human affairs with his whole personality, and pays less attention to nature. Nature is merely used as a rhetorical device and brought into the works. Therefore, that kind of pantheistic color is avoided.</p>
<p>However, some authors do not attempt to deify nature in their descriptions of nature. They merely want to describe nature more vividly, and unintentionally reveal shadows of pantheism by deifying it. In order to make nature sentimental, it is necessary to use personification in writing about nature, giving nature a certain personality. Moreover, as a result of excessive exaggeration, its personality will inevitably become infinitely great. Here, nature is united with God. Li Pei Tai Fu, in criticizing Xiao Lokhov's "Virgin Soil Upturned," said:</p>
<p>"The reason why Xiao Lokhov stands out among many writers in our country is that he has the skill to beautifully describe nature with rich talent. The uniquely beautiful scenery on the Don River prairie, the ensemble of all the complex voices of the people who live there, the extremely delicate and flavorful shadows, and the rich changes in the colors of the southern sky—all of these are expressed in Xiao Lokhov's works. The author wields great skill, allowing readers to feel the groans of laborers in the prairie under the intense summer sun, and to feel as if they are in the silence of a winter night… In 'Virgin Soil Upturned,' natural descriptions also form beautiful poetic passages. All these descriptions, more precisely, the author's view of nature transplanted into this work, is permeated with a great, burning love for endless life. In Xiao Lokhov's case, nature is not an opposing, unrelated power. Nature is ever-changing, overcoming all obstacles in life. The life of nature is consistent with the life of humanity. Human activities and reality have their echoes and basis in nature's rolling, endless creative power. Nature is not beautified by abstract rationalism, but by the beauty of profound feeling… Humanity and nature unite, creating a primordial state filled with endless life. … In 'Quiet Flows the Don,' this unity and combination of nature and humanity is everywhere tinged with a unique shadow of pantheism. The relationship between nature and humanity transcends ordinary, natural concepts, carrying something of an object's existence. No matter when, it always expresses an attitude close to 'nature worship.' This is especially felt when explaining the relationship between humans and the land. The land seems to have a certain attraction for Xiao Lokhov. Humans and nature are connected like ropes. If the earth calls, humans respond to its call and leave. He can abandon all work and temporarily forget the aggression, first making the land fertile… In 'Virgin Soil Upturned,' there is no such pantheistic tone. The land is still seen as just a piece of land. The relationship between humans and the land is simple, with self-evident qualities. This is very good. The land, like all of nature, does not lose its charm because of this. The persuasive power of art, the poetic style of narration, only under its shelter, there is a bit of a tendency to fall into a humanistic, biological view of nature…"</p>
<p>This shows that even authors who hold a new worldview inevitably carry a shadow of pantheism because of their love for the benefits that nature gives to humanity when they describe nature. Although it does not hinder the greatness of the work, it is also a tendency that should be corrected. Gorky went even further, calling on poets to shout to humanity: Contend with nature! Dominate nature! He says in his article on the subject of poetry:</p>
<p>"Past poets, as farmers and landlords, as children of nature, and essentially as slaves of nature, were ecstatic about the beauty and gifts of nature. In the poetic attitude towards nature, the most common and obvious thing that can be heard is the voice of meekness and flattery. Even now it can still be heard. In fact, praise for nature is praise for a tyrant. In that tone, it almost always reminds people of prayer. Poets, like mutually agreed upon keeping silent, never spoke of the ugly atrocities of nature—such as earthquakes, floods, hurricanes, droughts, and all kinds of outbreaks and madness of blind natural forces that destroy thousands of people and destroy their manual labor. Poets who once wanted to 'burn people's feelings with words' (which did not succeed much) or wanted to awaken 'good feelings' in people (which ultimately did not succeed) never shouted to humanity: Contend with nature! Dominate nature! Sometimes they were indignant at two-legged despots, but they were never indignant at blind tyrants… "</p>
<p>Here, Gorky's meaning is very clear. Poets should never merely pay tribute to nature with praise and love. Poets must awaken people, letting them know that they have the power to overcome nature. Here, poets should first poeticize human labor, which is the fundamental pillar of culture. Poets should first give poetic realm to the group's organized efforts to change the original forces of nature through contention. In other words, poets should first give poetic encouragement to the methods by which humans, based on their will, change and imagine the energy to create "second nature." Therefore, writers must first establish such a correct view of nature so that they will not fall into the quagmire of pantheism when describing nature.</p>
<h3 id="e184">Memory <a href="#e184" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c184" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">184</a></h3>
<p>— Hei Ding</p>
<p>Batur and Gu Dongye</p>
<p>Dragging my tired steps, I, a ghost-like figure, finally arrived from a small Gurkha village at the foot of Mount Szak to a Nau Ho village of the Bula people near the river. On the way, I was blown by a gust of wind and snow, which caused my head to feel dizzy and heavy. My whole body was hot, like a burning fire.</p>
<p>Ah, I am sick.</p>
<p>I stayed at old man Ge Jiulie's house. At night, my thoughts were chaotic and troubled. The illness put me in a terrible situation, and I felt lost in loneliness and isolation.</p>
<p>The black night always enveloped these few households of the cold Nau Ho people. From the distant valleys and forests, there came a few sparse, faint barks of dogs. The clear February moonlight shone all over this quiet village. The horse was restless and trampling its hooves in the trough shed. The shadows of the trees in the courtyard were dense, and a cold wind was howling.</p>
<p>I did not get a peaceful sleep. It seemed as if my soul was struggling in this long black night, unable to find a home, wandering and desolate.</p>
<p>Ah, this vast Batu He Shuo wilderness, where can I find a decent pharmacy? Where can I find a doctor who is not very skilled in surgery? This is a microcosm of primitive society. All the enjoyments of civilized society have not yet been introduced into this ancient and remote country.</p>
<p>Just as I had just woken up from a nightmare, the dim room was completely filled with the faint light of a lamp. The old woman Kani Oluxi had gotten up at some point. She was sitting, hunched over, and trembling as she stroked my suffocating throat. A streak of spittle flowed from her mouth, and she murmured with a worried expression:</p>
<p>—Sir, wake up, wake up! We have not offended the gods!</p>
<p>Her voice was old and hoarse.</p>
<p>As she spoke, she used a withered, bony hand to push her old man, Ge Jiulie, who was sleeping next to her like a dead pig.</p>
<p>Old man Ge Jiulie woke up sluggishly.</p>
<p>Kani Oluxi then told Ge Jiulie in detail about what she had just heard about me waking up from a nightmare. Finally, she tore open her lips and said tremblingly:</p>
<p>—Hurry up and kneel down to the gods, and bless this gentleman with peace, just like us, so that he will have a strong body and never get sick.</p>
<p>Ge Jiulie followed his wife Kani Oluxi's instructions and hurriedly walked to a square earthen platform, knelt in front of the altar, and silently offered a sincere prayer there.</p>
<p>At this time, Ge Jiulie's son, Telingfu, and his beautiful daughter-in-law, Sha Manlijin, suddenly woke up from their sweet dreams.</p>
<p>They stared at me in surprise.</p>
<p>Kani Oluxi, on one side, was searching through the messy hair of her sixteen-year-old, crooked-nosed daughter, Daina Sai, whom she had just woken up, and on the other side, she was moving her gray and dry lips as she spoke to me. Because her mouth was devoid of teeth because of her old age, her speech was very unclear. When she saw Telinglin and Sha Manlijin wake up, she told them in detail about me waking up from a nightmare.</p>
<p>Sha Manlijin smiled lightly, her face like a floating red cloud. She widened her eyes at Kani Oluxi and cracked her lips:</p>
<p>—Are you so frightened?</p>
<p>Kani Oluxi smiled and said:</p>
<p>—Fortunately, the gentleman woke up quickly. Afterwards, I asked your father to pray for him in front of the gods again.</p>
<p>—The weather is cold on the road. Did you catch a cold? Do you have a fever?</p>
<p>Telingfu said in a melancholy and questioning tone.</p>
<p>—Um, um…</p>
<p>Smiling, I nodded.</p>
<p>Old man Ge Jiulie walked back from the altar, looking happy, and reached out to pick up a pipe from the ground, then grabbed a handful of tobacco from the tobacco pouch, loaded it into the pipe bowl, and smoked it facing the light. He looked at me for a while, then hesitated as if he was saying to me:</p>
<p>—The gods will definitely bless you, the gods will definitely bless you.</p>
<p>That strong, tall man, who was twenty-six or twenty-seven years old, with thick arms and a chubby face, and with two very round and bright eyeballs deeply embedded under his thick eyebrows, it was difficult to find any weakness in his appearance. Judging by his appearance, there was neither sorrow nor joy in his world. He was the typical new youth of this Batu He Shuo wilderness.</p>
<p>Daina Zhai, nestled in old woman Kani Oluxi's arms, shook her big mouth, drooled, and asked me like a fool:</p>
<p>—Hee hee, why don't you go back to your home? Hee hee…</p>
<p>I didn't pay attention to her. With my silence, she was about to open her mouth and nag me again, but she was scolded by the old woman, and she honestly just rolled her eyes and looked at my face.</p>
<p>Sha Manlijin stayed silent for a while, then asked me lonely:</p>
<p>—Sir, when did you come to the Batu He Shuo wilderness?</p>
<p>—Three months ago.</p>
<p>—Then where did you live three months ago?</p>
<p>—There is no fixed place, Duobo, Yiketulu Mountain Village, the valleys of Hada Mountain, I have been to all of them.</p>
<p>—There is always no place to settle down for a long time. Constantly running on the road, the wind and snow hit, it is easy to get sick. Alas…</p>
<p>She seemed a little lost.</p>
<p>I looked at them all surrounding me, and the intimate and warm voices of conversation, when I heard them, immediately gave me deep comfort and a heart-warming joy.</p>
<p>Telingfu was moved by the few words I and Sha Manlijin had said, and his face was involuntarily filled with strands of gloomy colors. Imagination gave him a transcendent indignation, and he looked around my body with melancholy eyes. Ah, my body was covered with a layer of travel-worn dust and the haggard shadows of dreams.</p>
<p>That voice, which seemed familiar to me, the caring voice of a loving mother, came out of his throat:</p>
<p>—Good friend, it is not easy for you to come to our Nau Ho Village. I hope you will live in our house. It is convenient, so don't be too restrained—this is my father, this is my mother, this is my younger sister, and then there is me and my wife.</p>
<p>He said so much to me intimately. After a while, his voice suddenly became louder, and a kind of sympathetic and powerful words strangely stimulated my heart:</p>
<p>—Good friend, your illness will get better, don't be sad. People who leave home must learn to be brave and decisive! Like us Bula people, like the Solun people.</p>
<p>This was an explosive bomb that was deeply thrown into my heart.</p>
<p>—Ah, ah…</p>
<p>My floating and throbbing heart began to be shattered by this exploding bomb!</p>
<p>It was still night outside. The wind was still blowing in the night.</p>

<p>If I were a painter, I would definitely silently, silently, use my pen earnestly to describe the lives of human beings, to paint a picture. In this picture, you can see blood-red hearts, people covered in claws and teeth, bullying each other. This one sucks the blood of that one, and that one sucks the fresh blood of another. They struggle and live in this swirling vortex, very naturally. They all sacrifice everything, even sucking the last drop of fresh blood from others, for the impulse to live.</p>
<p>If I were a musician, I would definitely create several musical scores, create several songs; and then let these songs spread in the streets and alleys, and in people's various paradises, so that those noble smiles would turn into cries, and those who are crying might laugh.</p>
<p>If I were a writer, I would definitely silently write a creation that is like a multi-faceted mirror, so that hypocrisy and ugliness would have no way to escape truthfully in front of it.</p>
<p>If I were a humorist, my pen would rarely have time to rest. People's lives are inherently humorous: as long as you pick up a pen, there is humorous material everywhere.</p>

<p>— Written by Hugh Auchelcross Translated by He Wei</p>
<p>Louise Torrence ran out, ran across the potato field, a towel for the dishes in her hand. "How did you know I wanted to go away with you?" she said indignantly. "How did you know?"</p>
<p>George Willard did not answer. They stood silently in the darkness, separated only by a fence. "You go first," she said. "Father is there. I will come. You wait by the granary at the Williams' place."</p>
<p>This young journalist had received a letter from Louise Torrence. This letter, sent to the office of the Winesburg Eagle, was just that morning. The letter was very simple, it only said: "If you want me, I am yours." She deliberately pretended that there was no relationship between them in the darkness near the fence, which made them feel very upset. "She's stubborn, she really is stubborn," he muttered to himself as he walked down the street, passing some wasteland where rice grew. The rice was planted all the way to the sidewalk and was already as tall as the shoulder.</p>
<p>Louise Torrence appeared from the front door of her house, still wearing the calico clothes she had been wearing to wash the dishes, and she was not wearing a hat. The child could see her holding the handle of the door in her hand, standing and talking to someone in the breeze. That must be her father, old Jack Torrence. Old Jack was half-deaf, so she was shouting very loudly. Then the door closed, and everything was dark and silent on the narrow little street. George Willard trembled as he had never trembled before.</p>
<p>In the shadows near the granary at the Williams' place, George and Louise stopped. They dared not speak. She was not very beautiful, and she even had a mole next to her nose. George guessed that it must be because she would wipe her nose with her fingers after picking up the pots in the kitchen.</p>

<h3 id="e187">The Mermaid Cried <a href="#e187" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c187" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">187</a></h3>
<p>— Jia Wei</p>
<p>The Sixth National Games, which opened on the Double Tenth National Day, at the magnificent municipal stadium built in front of the "New Shanghai" municipal government at a cost of more than one million, and with the enthusiastic support of hundreds of thousands of spectators, the famous athletes from all over the country have indeed repeatedly broken many of the Games, national, and even Far East records, which is gratifying. As for the entanglements caused by the qualification issues of athletes participating in two events in the Games; and the temporary excuses of countless athletes (even famous ones) to abandon the competition, they all revealed the true intentions and ambitions of the general public to participate in the Games. This cannot but be considered a regret and deserves the attention of the athletes and the general public - what is the true meaning of sports after all?</p>
<p>Speaking of the athletes in the Games, the most famous and most eye-catching, "known to women and children," is Ms. Yang Xiuqiong, the "Mermaid" from Hong Kong.</p>
<p>Indeed, since the "Mermaid" became famous in the previous National Games, she has truly become a popular figure and an important person concerned by everyone in society (especially the adults and brothers who admire her name and her person). I remember that after the last Games closed, there was the opening of the Shanghai-Ping Combined Transport Line, and she was invited to perform the ribbon-cutting ceremony. The old "sports enthusiast" who created Tai Chi exercises, advocated kicking shuttlecocks, and flying kites, specially prepared a carriage and personally drove her to tour the capital city to see the light. After she returned, newspapers everywhere often published news about her, especially concerned about her marriage. This year, when a swimming pool was completed in a certain place, she was specially invited from thousands of miles away with thousands of gold pieces for travel expenses to perform the opening ceremony.</p>
<p>This time she came, in addition to the crowds welcoming her at the pier, so crowded that male athletes had to protect her to break through, that enthusiasm, that grandeur, there were also hotels sending letters inviting her to stay for free, and providing transportation, and newspapers had special reporters to write a diary for her every day - getting up early and sleeping late, three meals a day, all copied and published without a mistake. It can be said that she received the welcome of people from all walks of life, who can match her, the darling of heaven!</p>
<p>However, things turned out unexpectedly. The 50-meter swimming final on the 17th was a disaster. Look: "After the 50-meter race, Miss Yang was runner-up, and no one cared about her when she came out of the water; her pink face was flushed, and her eyes seemed unable to bear the pain, she lowered her head dejectedly and went straight to the lounge, sobbing. This is the first time since the lady has enjoyed fame that she has been defeated..."</p>
<p>"Pink face flushed," "lowered her head dejectedly," "sobbing," how touching is that! This will worry the people who care about her.</p>
<p>However, in the 50-meter preliminary and semi-final, and the 100-meter freestyle and backstroke races, our "Mermaid" still set amazing new records, and indeed lived up to expectations. May the "Mermaid" strive for it!</p>
<p>Originally, there must be competition and rivalry on the sports field. However, this is not about being competitive and vying for the limelight for a while. This is something that every athlete must understand. Especially since we are in the era and environment of "this time, this place," everything is in contradiction, competition, and struggle... How will young people go a step further to understand society, understand their responsibilities, and prepare to participate in this greatest competition, no, struggle!</p>
<h3 id="e188">Solitary Courtyard <a href="#e188" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c188" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">188</a></h3>
<p>— Xinye</p>
<p>It was a deep autumn dusk, and the profound, solitary courtyard lay still like the night itself. All around was quiet, as if one could hear a small insect crawling across the eaves, over the petals of the begonia, and over the slender leaves of the orchid. It seemed as though the petals and leaves were trembling slightly and sighing. But soon, even this minimal sound ceased. What was left was the clear, calm night, like a gentle wave. In the hazy moonlight and faint starlight, one could vaguely make out the black shadows of camellias in the corner of the courtyard. Although the osmanthus trees outside the wall only stretched out a few branches, the wafts of osmanthus fragrance were carried over by the light autumn breeze. The faint moonlight reflected on the flowers and leaves, resembling a layer of pale green glow or silver waves floating on the water's surface.</p>
<p>Han, alone, draped in a sleeping gown, inserted three sticks of Fujian sandalwood into the ancient bronze incense burner on his desk, which had been neglected for a long time. He leaned against the vermilion-lacquered railing before the steps, gazing blankly at the greyish-white smoke rising from the sandalwood, curling outwards towards the window, and then disappearing into the vast, desolate courtyard.</p>
<p>—Ah, that ancient courtyard, it is forever lonely!</p>
<p>The night, that boundless night, was as vast and desolate as this courtyard, and even more like his own heart, stagnant and lost. He stood there quietly, contemplating; no, he was chewing over life, caressing the heart wounded by life. Because he needed peace, he abandoned his friends, abandoned love, abandoned everything, and fled back here from a very distant place, to this ancient courtyard.</p>
<p>"Squeak—squeak—squeak—." A few sharp cries squeezed out from under the courtyard steps, carrying a hint of dampness, like a piece of shattered jade rolling from afar and falling onto the moss saturated with moisture, yet disappearing like a mountain path.</p>
<p>—This is a lonely autumn insect without a mate—is it also feeling the sorrow of loneliness like people do?</p>
<p>He gradually raised his head, looking up at the sky. On the celestial curtain was a not-entirely-full, one could not even say how incomplete, crescent moon, surrounded by a large halo. The few stars beside it were twinkling playfully, reflecting in his eyes.</p>
<p>The old, thin chrysanthemums squatted silently in a corner of the courtyard, resembling a dying old man, so dejected, lacking the vitality of the past few days. Although the shadow of the artificial rockery still stood in the goldfish tank, one could no longer discern its exquisite and intricate peaks and cliffs, nor could one see the vibrant and lovely Puer grass on top. This bleak autumn night was like a widow's plain clothes, billowing with a faint sorrow.</p>
<p>His thoughts were like a wisp of smoke, drifting, aimless, circling in an elusive reminiscence; even more like a lost lone crow, merely wandering in this sea of night. A memory, a hope, and a life, like a measuring rod reaching the sky, dragged past in front, as if wanting to measure the length of this vast and indistinct journey of life, to see how long, how far, lay ahead.</p>
<p>Silently, he shifted his gaze back to the window. In the ancient bronze incense burner at the window, faint wisps of smoke still drifted, but the smoke was so weak that it was almost like a tiny strand of silk. The crescent moon, encircled by its halo, was also covered by a layer of clouds. And so this courtyard, this surrounding area, suddenly lost even this pale light. He placed his hand on the vermilion-lacquered railing, already damp with night dew. A chill, like a finely woven brown bug, burrowed straight from his fingertips, crawled into the depths of his heart, and coiled in his chest, gnawing at his heart. Suddenly, he shuddered, and hurriedly withdrew his hand. A withered leaf fell from the decaying old parasol tree at the courtyard gate, landing silently in front of him, brushing against the railing with a cold, soft sound; it was as if his soul had silently plunged into the abyss of emptiness and darkness.</p>
<p>—The days of the past, truly a long spring dream…</p>
<p>An old memory from the past drifted dreamily into his heart, and the accumulated sadness in his heart was stirred up. The old and new wounds of the past few years resurfaced vividly and intensely, rising up. Large, large teardrops slipped from his eyelids to the tips of his eyelashes, congealing into crystalline beads, like a drop of dew on a grassy tomb, so round that without a breeze to shake it, it would fall unrecoverably onto the steps…</p>
<p>—Ah, that ancient courtyard, it is forever lonely!</p>

<h3 id="e189">Notes by the Window <a href="#e189" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c189" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">189</a></h3>
<p>— Family Member</p>
<p>One Dusk</p>
<p>Shaking off the fatigue that had accumulated throughout the day, one suddenly felt relaxed. The room had gradually darkened to the point where one could not see clearly at arm's length, but I did not like lighting a cigarette at this time. Quietly, I moved my legs and stood by the window, silently receiving the slight chill of the evening breeze, silently appreciating the blurry outlines of the houses, the vague shadows of the trees, slowly engulfed by the dense evening mist outside the window. Before dusk arrived, there were weary travelers wandering on the outskirts of the fields, hurrying on their way to rest, and there were also black wings of crows returning to their nests, sorrowful in the dim heavens.</p>
<p>Like a gorgeously dressed, smiling girl, or like a terrifying nightmare, dusk brings the fragrance of roses, scattered in the warm houses, in everyone's thoughts, blooming with brilliant flowers of memory. But at the same time, she creates much sorrow and anxiety in the hearts of the wandering travelers in the wilderness who do not know where to go. And so, regarding the distant, nighttime metropolis, a charming face, in the intertwining of red lights, in a dark corner, all kinds of bizarre things are reflected, the fallen round face, I, however, ponder and appreciate with mysterious emotions.</p>
<p>Two Wandering</p>
<p>It seems like a daze, or like half a lifetime ago, it has been several years since I came to this metropolis. Now, I am familiar with many of the streets, many of the houses, and even many of the faces here, as if they were old friends. But I always feel that this is not a place where I can live for a long time. I always think that one day I will turn to another place, and that there is still a home left behind in the distant past, a hometown where I grew up. Although now I think of it very faintly and not often. Regarding my hometown, regarding my home, even when I recall it, I can only use a kind of wistful mood to feel sad and contemplate, because I don't even know when I will be able to return to my lovely hometown. Perhaps an unfortunate fate has secretly destined me only to have the hardship of an eternal journey of wandering to end this life, with no chance to see my hometown again. And in these days, from that city to this city, I am used to the solitary wandering life. I am like a small boat on the water, "drifting in all directions with the waves, able to dock anywhere," and so everywhere is home. At this moment, I am extremely tired. The long years of wandering have only given me a back full of heavy dust and a heart empty of everything, yet I have no worries, no sorrow, but at the same time no hope, no ideals, not even dreams. I know why the smoke drifts from the window, why the stars twinkle in the sky, why the lake water ripples in the wind, why the cuckoos cry in the middle of the night. Knowing these things, I am at peace with my wandering, without feeling any sadness or longing for the past.</p>
<p>Three City Life</p>
<p>Immersed in the day and night of noisy, mechanical sounds, the sounds of vehicles, all kinds of sounds mixed together to form the unique urban noise, coupled with the all-encompassing thick black coal smoke, it will really make people feel suffocated. When you go out and come back, your nose is full of dirt and your face is covered in dust. The people in the city, indeed, the clamorous noise alone is enough to make you suffer from hysteria. And gradually, your emotions become thinner and thinner, almost thinning to the point of completely losing their function. At this time, your senses become duller and duller, as if you have become a soulless machine, indifferent to everything and showing no interest at all, mechanically passing the days without any lively emotions. Life is a pool of stagnant water, never able to stir up waves, and life is even more of a burden, wasted meaninglessly. I see many people numbing themselves with strong sensual pleasures all day long, letting their spirits crawl under the yoke of material things. Time seems to stop flowing in people's eyes. It is the footsteps of time that are rapidly rushing past people, but people have not caused any surprise. And so everyone frantically, painfully, is engulfed in all the circles of ruined women and licentiousness, trying their best to climb up to the crater, but not thinking that the suppressed fire will soon erupt, and burn their bodies into ashes, the tourists laughing on the crater.</p>
<h3 id="e190">In the Hutong <a href="#e190" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c190" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">190</a></h3>
<p>— Green Leaf</p>
<p>—Impressions of an Ancient City</p>
<p>In ordinary days, there are two sounds in the small hutong that add to the grayness and loneliness of the ancient city: in the daytime, it is the blind fortune teller's gong, and at night, it is the night watchman's clapper. These have the charm of the Middle Ages and contain the nostalgia for a distant home.</p>
<p>In the small hutong, besides these ancient sounds that have been around for a long time, there is the sound of the peddler's small rattle drum, but the peddler runs around in the streets and alleys, coming once every two or three days; therefore, every day in the hutong, there are only these two sounds, knocking through other people's dreams, knocking through the heart of the ancient city.</p>
<p>Every day, when the sun shines on the roof ridge, the hutong is so quiet that there is not a single breeze; then the blind fortune teller strikes his fortune-telling gong, perhaps he already knows how old the girl in which family is, and which family has a lonely old widow whose son is on a distant expedition in a foreign land; he has also figured out the height of which stone in the hutong, and walks slowly in the hutong, letting the sunlight shine on his face. The fortune-telling gong in his hand "Ke dang! Ke dang!" rings and rings, echoing in the silent hutong. At this time, a little girl's shrill voice calls out to the blind fortune teller in the hutong. I know that it is the old widow across the street who has called the little maidservant to ask the blind man to predict the good and bad luck of her son abroad. In this way, making a blind inquiry can put a big stone down from the old woman's heart, right? I don't care about this foolish superstitious behavior, but I bless this lonely old widow living alone.</p>
<p>The hutong of the ancient city is also gray, and you often don't see a child in the daytime; if you want to eavesdrop on the innocent laughter of children to warm the heart of a wanderer, it is not possible. What there is, are gray walls with peeling whitewash, gray roofs, and gray sand: everything is painted with gray pigment, so the ancient city is also called a symbol of a person's twilight years. At dusk, the waning moon hangs on the corner of the roof, and there is not a ghost shadow in the hutong; walking step by step in the hutong, you can hear the sound of your own footsteps and the rustling of a piece of wind from your clothes. Later in the night, the old night watchman comes, knocking on the bamboo clapper in the small hutong, just like the blind fortune teller's gong in the daytime, waking up other people's dreams: and at night, the hutong only has this one sound, and only he alone rules this hutong.</p>
<p>Every day, listening to these two sounds in the small hutong, I often think of a folk rhyme about blind men and night watchmen in my hometown, which is full of rough rural flavor. (But in the ancient city, there is not a single folk rhyme related to the immortal-like people who live apart from the crowd). In my childhood, I and the other children often ran behind the blind man, singing that folk rhyme loudly, making the blind man only wear an awkward face, which was fun: the mood of childhood was not schadenfreude, but just to join in the fun. But now, wandering in the ancient city, listening to the sounds of the clapper and the fortune-telling gong; I have long lost the mood of a child, and I have forgotten most of this folk rhyme.</p>

<p>Parents and Children</p>
<p>The theme song of the cultural sound film "Parents and Children" today: High-ranking guests are seated, dancing and singing; ladies and gentlemen, colorful and excited. But, don't you see: Red land for thousands of miles, floods raging; wailing everywhere, starving people crying! Don't you hear: External insults and internal troubles, ghosts crying and gods howling; natural and man-made disasters, the starving lying in the streets! Thousands upon thousands of parents and children, separated from life and death; families broken and people dead, wailing and crying! Listen, the alarm has sounded! In danger, the land of our parents! How can we still enjoy ourselves today? We must be the "parents and children" of the times, quickly launch the angry tide of national liberation! If we don't rise up today, when will we? The rise and fall of the nation, all depends on us!</p>

<p>New Voice (1380) from 3:45 PM to 4:45 PM</p>
<p>Opening "Fruit Report Follow-up Visit"</p>
<p>The imperial inspector Mao Longxing is in high spirits, and looks around with a romantic air, very heroic. The master and servant duo travel along the riverbank. They call for a flat boat and the oars sing a lullaby. The river water is turbulent and the wind is light. Xiangcheng is faintly visible and the road is far away. The young boatman is named Wang Xi. He pushes a pole to guide the boat. They chat and ask each other questions. They relieve boredom in the boat. He visits a sworn brother in the city. The two words "South Building" are his surname, Diao. Unexpectedly, the boatman often sighs. He pities his wife who went to the underworld last year. On the Dragon Boat Festival, he returned from Yangzhou. His wife drank wine on the roof of the building. She welcomed the eastern person into the inner room. It was a bad time and her life was difficult to escape. The steamed bun was like a soul-calling ticket. It ended the hero's life. How can the words of poisoning be said? Adultery and plotting murder is difficult to eliminate. There is already real evidence before your eyes. The adulterous woman and adulterer should be executed by slicing them into pieces. Waiting for an honest official to file a lawsuit. Otherwise, there will be trouble first. The concubine is chaste and the servant is righteous. They will avenge the master one day. Anger makes it difficult to control oneself. He jumps in the cabin several times with boots on. He visits in person.</p>

<p>Opening "Hero and Beauty"</p>
<p>A grand and passionate hero. He establishes great achievements in a strange way. I see him. He repeatedly calls his sworn sister. One child. He politely calls her cousin. They are. They talk and say with affection. Sometimes they laugh and have fun. It's a real delight. Poor me. I have so much sorrow and distress. I always remember it in my heart. They are sweet and intimate. They are very lively. I am cold and lonely. I hate endlessly. Most hateful. He sings the opening carelessly. He meets her carelessly. It's ridiculous. He touches. A seductive prostitute. He also. Stretches and shrinks his face red. I can't see it all. Dragging and pulling is really funny. It's ridiculous. He is in a hurry like crazy. Admirable him. He studies hard every day and night. I see him. He does everything carefully. Admirable him. He thinks of loving the country in his heart. Sometimes. He weeps and cries endlessly. Because I. I am a stranger who speaks. That's why. I stutter and call him brother. Oh... brother. I see you. You are majestic and heroic. Why. Stupidly pretending to be silent. Poor me. I come to persuade you in a tortuous way. I wish you. Diligently and frugally work hard. Marry one. A beautiful woman.</p>

<p>Mr. Tong Lei, the Yanyan Society broadcasting on the mainland was recently established. Originally, when they discovered that there was a distinction between old and new, they were preparing to change their name, but unfortunately they have been broadcasting in the mainland for a long time, and it is very difficult to change their name temporarily, so now it is named "Shanghai Yanyan Society" (Flying Ear)</p>
<p>Jiaoming Society has moved to No. 2 Baishoufang, Penglai Road, and will officially broadcast (Evening)</p>
<p>Recently, the "New Night News" broadcasting miscellaneous scene published that Mingyue Society's Li Mingjian is not surnamed Li, nor is he surnamed Qian, but is surnamed Yu, (completely wrong) but is the daughter of Qian Xinzhi. (The truth)</p>
<p>Qingping Society is organized by Shao Chenjun. It is said that Shao Jun is a member of the closed Haisheng Society.</p>
<p>Miss Lin Linlang of Mingyue Society, former president of Lingling Society, is now organizing Suzhou Linlang Society for broadcasting on Bailing Radio.</p>
<p>Mr. Liu Morong of the old brand Meihua Concert recently got engaged to Miss Yu Jiangu, a talented high school student.</p>
<p>Meiling Troupe reports that Mr. Mei Qing has been late to the troupe.</p>
<p>Hu Shuxin, the head of the Songfeng Troupe, recently cheated a certain gentleman of a Hualin set and entrusted a friend to sell it for 25 silver dollars.</p>
<p>Zhenzhen of the Greater Shanghai Society, due to some reasons, left the Greater Shanghai and joined the Starlight Society. Recently, she has not found it interesting and wants to find another business to maintain her livelihood (the recession in the broadcasting industry). (Above, Xinmin Society)</p>
<p>Luyin said to Huang Yuanying, a reporter from Donglu: "I'll teach you how to sing," but in the end, she left without even finishing teaching a "Main Road Song."</p>
<p>Luyin and Xu Wenbi have reconciled again. That day, Xu Wenbi said to Luyin: "Are you going to Dahua?" Finally, they walked out of the radio station hand in hand.</p>
<p>Yu Yueming likes to wrap a handkerchief around his arm. (Above, Soft Feet)</p>
<p>Xu Qi, the president of Qiyin Society, said: "Tonight I'm going to the Rose Troupe to find Yang Zenshu, because of the three people who talked to him in the Lake Society that day, why didn't you tell me which one was Silver Rain?"</p>
<p>Brother Yinyu: I am willing to cooperate with you. If you don't mind, please indicate your mailing address and have it forwarded by the aftersound editor of this newspaper (Above, Bai Xue)</p>
<p>Mr. Baixue: For the sake of the reputation and future of singing groups, these "scum" should be criticized; however, "Aftersounds" has already stated its purpose yesterday, and if there is solid evidence, it will not hesitate to use space to announce their "ugly state".</p>
<p>Your manuscript has been cut, very sorry. This is a reply. (Editor)</p>
<p>The 30th issue of the Radio Broadcasting Weekly has been published, containing special news from the film and broadcasting industries, and also attached with the latest broadcasting program.

<h3 id="e196">Some Rejoice, Some Grieve <a href="#e196" class="section-anchor" data-counterpart="#c196" style="color:#aaa;text-decoration:none;font-size:0.6em;">196</a></h3>
<p>"Some rejoice, some grieve," these are such heartbreaking words, especially in these times of chaos and famine. The inequalities of the world are completely exposed in these seven short words, truly great! This folk song.</p>
<p>The wealthy eat delicacies and wear fine silk. When they hear this folk song sung, naturally they don't feel anything. Like the Zifang couple, when they have guests and are toasting under the moon, singing this "Bending Moon" folk song is purely an offhand expression, and they don't realize it's a foreshadowing of their family's future.</p>
<p>If the mountain flood hadn't erupted, their family would have lived happily. They would never have had the ending of husband leaving wife, and their personalities wouldn't have changed so quickly. But things rarely go as wished in this world. No one's life story is ever just a plain record. There will always be a twist to embellish it. This five-act play "Bending Moon" also narrates the separations and reunions, joys and sorrows of life, the wickedness of human nature, and the horror of women relying solely on their husbands. After the husband and wife are separated and living different lives, on nights of family reunion, when they sing this folk song "Some rejoice, some grieve" again, they will naturally have different feelings. The husband, Zifang, lost Manzhu, but has another charming noble lady by his side, so he will naturally feel that the present is better than the past. However, for Manzhu, comparing her current situation with past happiness, she will definitely feel miserable and heartbroken.</p>
<p>This large-scale play movement by the Mingxing Film Company is led by Hu Die, and performed by all the male and female stars. Combined with such a sad and touching story as "Bending Moon," its sensational success is predictable—this is a good opportunity. We hope the audience who love plays will not miss it.</p>

<p>— Nanjing Screening</p>
<p>A Song Presented</p>
<p>In "Little Aunt," there are two songs composed by Mr. Li Jinhui. One is "Under the Moon," sung by Xia Peizhen, and the other is "Flowery World," sung by Ying Yin. Both have already been recorded by Baidai.</p>
<p>"Under the Moon," Xia Peizhen sings in the desolate moonlit night garden, fully conveying the sad mood. As for "Flowery World," Ying Yin sings it in the peach blossom forest, leaning tipsily in her lover's arms; as light as goose feathers, as fiery as burning passion!</p>
<p>Song fans, please note: The "Joyful Forest" has already begun giving away these two songs. Enclose two cents for postage and send it to the Propaganda Department of "Joyful Forest" Company, No. 1 Renchang Lane, Kaizi'er Road, Shanghai, and you will receive a beautiful song score.</p>

<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>I heard people say that Yuan Shouzhi ultimately can't leave Ying Yunwei. I wonder what that means?</p>
<p>"Sea Burial" has stopped showing at the New Light Theater. A friend said that if Shao Zuiweng were in Shanghai, Wang Bin would definitely not have the opportunity to direct a second film. And now, in Shao Cunren's hands, I wonder if he's also judging the quality of films based on box office success or failure? I'm very concerned.</p>
<p>It's said that "Imperial Envoy" will follow "Wave Village" and be shown at the Jincheng Theater. Others say that "Wave Village" will be followed by "Filial Piety," which has been advertised for a long time. The two accounts are conflicting. I don't know which is true. According to the news I've obtained, "Filial Piety" is currently being dubbed. If it's ready in time, it will be released after "Wave Village." If not, "Imperial Envoy" will be shown.</p>
<p>It was previously said that "Filial Piety" was scheduled to be released on Double Tenth Day (October 10th). At that time, it was purely a silent film. After the screening rights for Double Tenth Day were negotiated and "Metropolitan Scenery" was shown by Diantong, a soundtrack was added.</p>
<p>It's heard that when "Imperial Envoy" is shown, the order of appearance will determine the ranking. On the posters, the order may be based on the number of strokes in the surnames. The rumors about Yuan Meiyun fighting for a higher ranking are probably inaccurate, because she is actually quite clever.</p>
