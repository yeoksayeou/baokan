<p>時評</p>
<h3>滿洲里會議與日蘇關係</h3>
<p>— 宜</p>
<p>日蘇關係自九一八以來。屢趨緊張。然蘇聯方面始終維持其和平外交政策。事事不惜委曲求全。以避戰禍。是以兩國至今仍能保持國交常態。近日蘇聯駐日大使優列尼夫且與日本廣田外相商議設立日蘇偽三國共同委員會。以謀解决一切邊境糾紛。似兩國關係益有改善趨勢。然據昨日東京電訊。滿洲里六日舉行「滿」「蒙」第十二次會議。為日本犬養測量員在蒙境被捕一案。雙方發生爭端。而哈爾哈廟之歸屬因亦成為問題。豫定九日繼續舉行之滿洲里會議。遂致延期。日方且聲稱外蒙方面如不變更態度。不惜撤回偽滿代表。是則近來漸見好轉之日蘇關係。又將嚴重化矣。</p>
<p>關於犬養被捕事件。外蒙向日「滿」當局提出聲明。謂日本軍官犬養及其隨從俄人哈布拉係在蒙古境內被捕。且此二人在接得日「滿」要求之前卽巳釋放。當此二人釋放時。彼等所有物之大部（包括馬及馬車）亦均發還。為求更進一步表示其和平願望。且將彼等所有物之被扣部份。全部送還日本軍官及共同伴。外蒙方面因欲避免再有邊境事伴發生。並提議就地召集「蒙」「滿」共同委員會。以審査各種邊境事件。此外又附帶聲明。如能證明彼等被捕於滿洲境內。願向「滿洲」道歉。並懲罰負責拘捕人員。就此項聲明以觀。蘇聯勢力下之「外蒙」可謂已盡表示善意力求和平之能事。而日本猶以對方毫無誠意為言。殆不能無題外之積極的意味矣。</p>
<p>雖然。日蘇兩國關係之惡化。非惟足以危害世界和平。抑亦非兩國本身之福。日本方面。近年軍費膨脹。國債激增。卽僅就財政一端而言。亦尙無衝破蘇聯遠東防綫之能力。至蘇聯方面。則國內建設工程正在進行。為戰爭而停頓。寗非全功盡棄。何况歐洲尙有後顧之憂。故此兩國縱有根本之矛盾。然在目前情勢之下。日蘇當局若各為自身利害着想。當不至於輕啟戰禍也。</p>
<h3>俄使與廣田接洽　邊境委員會案　蘇俄大使提出意見</h3>
<p>（東京）蘇聯駐日大使優列尼夫氏於十日午後三時四十分至外務省訪廣田外相、根據該本國政府之訓令、提示關於設立日滿蘇國境糾紛調停委員會之蘇聯具體方案、據謂蘇聯對於日滿蘇國境糾紛調停委員會之組織內容、認為倣傚與羅馬尼亞所訂之糾紛調停委員會辦法、最為適當、應請貴國充分考慮云、廣田外相對於此事置答如下、貴大使所提議貴國與羅馬尼亞國訂立該項委員會之前例、與日本政府計畫之內容不相同、余已接到此項情報、蓋處理最初之國境紛爭、似由該委員會担任、但聞自去年以來、似又專由外交機關處理、並聞尙有各種協定、究係指示任何年度之羅馬尼亞協定、仍顧承敎也云云、蘇聯大使聞言、卽謂、當再行請訓本國經調査後、當卽答覆、蘇聯所計畫之國境糾紛處理委員會內容、此次經其大致提議、業已明瞭、而日本方面則專意探聽蘇聯之意向、然後與之應付、故本問題現已踏入具體情形之第一步、其前途頗被重視也、（十日日聯電）</p>
<h3>南斯拉夫　向鯊魚宣戰　沿海一帶屢為人患　巡艦出動决予重創</h3>
<p>阜姆　南斯拉夫海軍當局以沿海一帶鯊魚為忠、特向鯊魚宣戰、數日前有二少年乘小艇出游、迄無影跡、最近有一少女在海邊游泳、忽吿失踪據一般人推測、恐皆葬身魚腹、海軍當局現己派遣巡洋艦杜勃龍號及小艦數艘、謀對鯊魚痛予懲創云（十日國民電）</p>
<h3>東菲和平絕望　意向英提新建議　控制阿比西尼亞雄心勃勃　要求劃政治經濟勢力範圍　聲明九月前不採軍事行動</h3>
<p>（倫敦）意大利駐英大使格蘭第、昨日向英國外部提出關於解决意阿爭端之建議、根據此項建議、意阿衝突、似有和平解决之可能、據倫敦意國方面人士所稱、意國所提議之大綱如下、</p>
<p>（一）意國對於意屬愛里德里與索謀里倫間之阿比西尼亞內地領土、應獲有一種政治保障、在事實上卽等於掌握該處領土、（二）除上述領土外、應在阿國劃定意國之政治及經濟勢力範圍、在此等勢力範圍內、意國得墾殖荒地、並監督禁止奴隸買賣云、聞英國政府尙未决定贊助意國此種要求、大約必須俟簽訂一九零六年阿比西尼亞條約之英法意三國成立恊定後、意阿兩國方有接近之可能也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>海牙　意阿混合仲裁委員會放棄工作以後、解决意阿爭端之唯一辦法、惟有按照五月二十五日國聯會行政院之决議案、除意阿原有仲裁四人外、增加第五中立仲裁委員、由行政院指派之、惟現聞意國仲裁委員拒絕行政院指派第五仲裁委員、其所根據之理由、則以為仲裁委員會職權問題、僅與意阿兩國政府有關、故不能由第三者仲裁解决云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）此間負責方面竭力否認東菲意軍業已進行其軍事計畫、或卽將有軍事行動之說、謂東菲各地須在九月以後始脫雨季、調解委員會之决裂、實與意阿爭執並無關係云、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>阿京　近來外間謠傳、意阿邊境情勢緊張、戰事有一觸卽發之虞、唯據此間官塲宣稱、阿京方而絕未接得此項消息、並稱、阿國政府以過去之糾紛、已使時局為之嚴重、故一舉一動現皆出以審愼、就目前論、殊無足以立卽引起戰事之任何行動也、（十日國民電）</p>
<h3>仲裁委員會　决裂原因有二　意方拒絕討論疆界問題　認與日內瓦妥恊案不合</h3>
<p>海牙　調査意阿爭案之共同委員會談判决裂後、各委員今日均散歸其目的地、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）據此間公吿、意阿調解委員會停會原因有二、（一）因阿比西尼亞代表不知五月十五·十六兩日意阿政府任命調解委員之妥恊細則、（二）因阿比西尼亞代表要求委員會討論不應討論之疆界問題、蓋此事應由一九〇八年意阿條約中規定之疆界管理委員會解决也、兩項原因可證阿比西尼亞意欲破壞委員會之工作、而意國所提出華爾華爾地方阿人暴行之證據則十分充足、阿比西尼亞今不願見委員會繼續工作以受懲戒耳、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>海牙　意阿兩關混合仲裁委員會、因雙方意見參差、調處無效、頃已决定放棄工作、按阿國代理人吉齊（巴黎大學法科敎授）陳述阿國立塲、係以華爾華爾地方為阿國領土、作為出發點、而意國代理人、則拒絕將邊界問題提出討論、混合委員會鑒於價査範圍受有限制　乃决定不、再繼績開會、吉齊敎授頃發表公報、謂「意阿兩國仲裁員、對於應否准許兩國代理人、對華爾華爾地方之確實位置、各自提出見解一層、意見完全參差、意國委員馬柯迪及蒙答那贊成意國代理人之主張、而阿國委員特賴潑拉德爾及波德、則謂對於意阿兩國見解、當於平等待遇、准其提出、此於問題之解决、並無妨害結果、委員會將此項意見參差之點、予以備案、並决定按照五月二十五日行政院决議案之規定、由行政院指派中立國仲裁委員、吉齊最後對於委會拒絕聆取渠之陳述、表示抗議、並擬將仲裁委員會之决議、向國聯會提出報吿、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>海牙　意阿混合仲裁委員會意國仲裁委員、向報界發表談話、反對阿國政府代理人吉齊所提出之主張、略謂古齊在委員會陳述、開端係提出華爾華爾侵略事件之責任問題、但繼忽提出華爾華爾之地理位置問題、因此意國仲裁委貴乃拒絕其繼續陳述、蓋按諸本年五月二十五日在日內瓦、成立之折衷辦法、華爾華爾之地理位置、不在仲裁委員會範國之內、當時阿國政府正式表示同意、僅將衝突事伴之事實及責任、交出仲裁委員會審査而不涉其他、今阿國政府因討論侵略責任問題、必遭敗訴、故另行提出華爾華爾地理位置問題云、又謂意大利仲裁委員曾兩度謀挽救委員會工作、最初提議先行解决委員會職權問題、然後冉行討論其餘各項問題、此項提議、遭阿國方面拒絕、繼復提議將委員會所爭執未决之問題、提交關係國加以討論、然後另行擇期繼續舉行仲裁委員會會議、此項提議、亦為阿國方面仲裁委員所拒絕、因此仲裁委員會、不得不放棄工作云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英繼續努力　覓取和解辦法　愛文諾在倫敦活動</h3>
<p>（倫敦）聞英當局尙未擬定撤回阿比西尼亞英僑之特殊辦法、蓋英當局認目前環境尙無採此步驟之必要也、同時倫敦對於意阿爭案之發展、當然極為重視、英政府刻仍繼續努力、欲於與法政府討論時覔取一種和解辦法、關於國聯秘書長愛文諾來遊倫敦事、現仍守秘密、但衆信愛文諾來英最大目的之一、在促請列强作種種可能的努力、俾在國聯行政院開會處理此問題以前解决意阿間之爭案、（十日路透社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）國聯事務大臣艾登今日吿下院、英國現正考慮解决意阿爭執之可能辦法、但不欲採取使時局愈增嚴重之任何步驟云、國聯秘書長愛文諾亦正與外相霍爾及艾登會商意阿爭執、（九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）國聯秘書長愛文諾抵此後頗形活動、顯將竭力消弭意阿之衝突、昨日愛氏與外相霍爾不管部大臣艾登及意大使葛蘭第等晤談、今明兩日則將與首相鮑爾溫艾登及阿比西尼亞公使商談、其目的顯在求得一種解决方法、旣不使國聯因意阿戰爭而崩潰、復不使意大利因國聯干涉卽退出、（十日國民社電）</p>
<h3>改良水利計畫　英國延緩進行　不欲使時局增嚴重性</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英國政府曾計畫在阿比西尼亞境內査那湖週圍、建造水閘、提高査那湖湖面、以改良尼羅河上游之水利、此項計畫、阿國政府表示並不反對、本日下院開會時、某議員特為　事詢問政府、經不管部大臣艾登答復、略謂「本年五月十日、阿比西尼亞政府曾邀請英國·埃及·及蘇丹政府、各派代表赴阿國京城舉行會議、討論關於査那湖建閘之問題、但因意阿兩國間、正發生不幸之爭執、且意阿雙方正在竭力設法、以謀解决所爭執之問題、故英國政府不欲於此際採取足以增加時局嚴重之任何步驟、為此英國政府特行通知關係各國政府、謂英國主張將査那湖建閘問題延緩討論、惟改良尼羅河上游水利、於埃及及蘇丹均有利益、自為英國之所贊同、且此種利益、業經阿國政府及法意政府加以承認、英國現僅等待適宜時機、以實施査那湖建閘之計畫、」云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意半官式報　勸英改變政策　維持國聯威信勿過認眞</h3>
<p>（羅馬）據消息靈通人士推測、英國對阿比西尼亞問題、行將改變現有態度、半官式意大利日報發表論文、以下列四點切觀英國、（一）對於國聯會之威信、勿過於認眞、（二）對於意國正當需要、當有較深之了解、（三）意國一旦佔領阿比西尼亞後、對於非洲英國利益之威脅、未必較阿國威脅英國利益為甚、（四）勿藐視歐洲聯帶關係、須知歐洲一旦發生戰爭、英國或有需要於此種聯帶關係也云云、（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意續頒命令　徵召士兵入伍　决用武力控制阿國</h3>
<p>（羅馬）政府頒佈命令、徵召一九〇九及一九一〇年兩級熟練士兵入伍、又薩伏瓦、（意國王朝之名）王室精粹近衛軍第三團、頃以抽籖辦法抽調一營前往菲洲、士兵聞開往菲洲之訊、皆高呼「首相萬歲」（九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）每日電聞報載稱、據意國陸軍參謀部估計、該國欲在阿比西尼亞作戰、至少當有陸軍四十萬員名、此際派往非洲之軍隊、尙不足二十萬員名、又稱、意相墨索里尼、並不拒絕舉行談判、藉以解决阿比西尼亞問題、但欲在國聯會之外舉行談判、綠意國目標係在軍事上完全控制阿國、一如法國之控制摩洛哥也云、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>意首相言論　專爲對外而發　遠征東菲勢不可耐　意兵家書多抱怨艾</h3>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦每日電聞羅馬訪員今日電稱、意國兵士所發家書、咸對於經過紅海時抱怨、因人多擁擠、熱不可耐、該通信員並稱、意相墨索里尼上星期六之演說、在意國並未發表、故彼以為此次演說原為對國外而發云、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>翁傑特被任　美駐阿京代辦</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美國對於阿比西尼亞時局問題之關切、可於國務院急速派遣外交代表駐在阿京一點上見之、據今日此間公佈、美國近東問題與東方語言專家翁傑特已被任為美國駐在阿京之代辦及總領事、按翁氏現任開羅美使館等秘書、奉令後現已首途前赴阿京矣、按阿京美國代辦一職、原已任命前哈爾濱美總領事亨生、唯以亨生對於近東事務並不熟悉、且於阿刺伯語文亦不通曉、故現已改派為薩龍尾喀總領事云、國際婦女和平聯合會向國務院提出抗議、指美國有意贊助意大利對阿侵略、蓋意阿兩國皆為非戰公約之簽字國、阿國向美之請求干涉、與美國之應出干涉、皆為道義所應有、赫爾對於阿皇之復牒不應如是迴避責任云、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>戰事一觸卽發　外僑紛離阿境</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據駐阿京之每日快報記者電稱、阿比西尼亞之美僑及其他外人現已開始退出、火車一列滿載阿京附近之外僑開向邊境而去、蓋意阿兩國軍隊現正向阿比西尼亞、伊利特利亞及意屬索馬里之綫佈防也、接近阿王之官員今日官稱、吾人隨時準備接戰云、（十日國民電）</p>
<h3>英國積極　訓練航空人才　全國添設航空校五處</h3>
<p>（倫敦）航空部宣稱、政府當於短時期之內、添設航空學校五處、用以造就駕駛員並訓練後備飛行員、又稱「倫效大學飛行隊」正在編制中、當於十月一日開始服務云、按本年五月二十二日前航空大臣倫敦德里勛爵、曾在上議院宜佈皇家空軍擴充計劃、謂英國本部空軍、除海軍飛機外、將於兩年內增添第一綫飛機至一千五百架之數、駕駛員將增添二千五百名、今茲添設航空學校五處、卽係上項計劃之一部份、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英下院中　新內閣勝利第一聲　救濟失業無方工黨提彈劾　卒以四五〇對七六票打銷　新政未見採納勞合頗悻悻</h3>
<p>（倫敦）包爾溫之政府今夜在下院中受第一次之試騐而獲安全、蓋工黨因政府未能製定應付失業之方案、特動議彈劾、繼付表决、而以四五〇對七六票打銷也、此動議乃由麥唐納第一次政府中之衛生大臣現充工黨議員格林武提出者、格氏謂政府應付失業、全無方略、而處置受患區域之問題、亦欠認眞、失業問題必須施行减短工作時問、俾將所减之時間為失業者覓求工作、政府對較短工作週所持之態度、實足為大國羞、政府現自稱業已增進商業、其實政府於此毫無功績可言云、</p>
<p>包爾溫答詞、追述政府經濟與財政政策之進展、並要求反對黨提出世界有何他國在過去三四年內比英國進步更多之蹬據、又謂彼等曾見某大國在空前廣大之範中運用國家之經費、雖已造成若干良好結果、但迄未能使國家實業復興、英國不贊成此種巨額費用、除非其確能造成復興耳、英國在建設計畫上如整頓航業、淘汰蘭開夏過剩紗錠、及改善倫敦運輸等事、現已不惜用去巨欵、英國之工作狀况、為世界之最佳者、目前生活代價、較諸一九三四年已跌落百分之二十、而貨幣與工資之變更、則减落之數不足百分之五、政府政策在造成一種信任空氣、渥太華之協定與用以交涉互惠的條約之稅則、亦對此難題有所供給、使人發生恐慌、以為阻力將來自不可預料之方面者、乃世界不寗靜狀態所致、故國家信用無論對內對外、尤不可稍加以損害、公共工程之費用、必須有下述條件而後始為正當、卽此項費用可振興實業、庶使國民力能荷此財政擔負、並於經費用罄時維持其進步之繼續是也、首相繼言及受失業之患各區域之問題、謂此事仍為政府所遭最感困難之一事、失業區域調査委員會之報吿書、不久將送交政府、渠希望政府可根據其建議以謀改善云、</p>
<p>自由黨辛克萊抨繫政府之經濟政策、責政府未有大規模建設計畫、以發展天然利源而减少失業人數、</p>
<p>前檢察長克利沛斯代表工黨作最後之辯論、其言大旨與格林武所發者相同、謂政府未有可與時常變化的狀態適應之計畫、致使國人受累云、</p>
<p>最後西門發言、謂英國在製造生產上已追及一九二九年之程度、法國則較一九二九年减百分之二九、德國亦低百分之一五、美國低落尤甚達百分之三七、自舉國一致的政府成立以來、失業人數已减百萬、英國人民以穩健的精神拒絕狂妄的嘗試、鼓勵績求進步之有計畫的努力、現使國家逐步渡過極困難之時期、而向復興之目標前進、世界各國莫不妬之羨之云、</p>
<p>路透社探悉勞合喬治認首相所發之言論為拒絕其新政計畫之表示、故已函致首相、請解除不公布其新政計畫之約言、又本日投票表决工黨之動議時、勞合喬治薩繆爾及其他自由黨議員均贊助工黨、（九日路透電）</p>
<h3>一九三五年　德國造艦經費　估計約需十萬萬馬克</h3>
<p>（柏林）一九三五年德國海軍程序、卽規定建造二萬六千噸之戰艦兩艘·一萬噸之巡洋艦兩艘者、德國各報皆視為「中庸」、據各報載稱、新戰艦將仿法國二萬六千五百噸之登扣克式戰艦建造、法艦裝十三吋口徑之大砲八尊、惟德國最重之砲為十一吋、故新戰艦將裝十一吋之砲八尊、萬噸巡洋艦兩艘、大約將仿著名「袖珍式戰艦」建造、一九三五年海軍程序之經費、共需幾何迄未公布、惟據私人佔計、當在馬克十萬萬左右、除戰艦與巡洋艦外、程序中尙列有軀逐艦十六艘、潛艇二十八艘、（十日路透電）</p>
<p>法國之反響</p>
<p>（巴黎）此間今日消息、法國對於德國海軍計劃、以為德國擬於三四年內建造戰艦四十萬噸、故一般人預料法國將拒絕簡派海軍代表至倫敦討論海軍問題云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>美國之見解</p>
<p>（華盛頓）高級海軍當局今日已見德國對於戰艦之大小問題、將與英日一致、反對美國之大艦政策、此項見解係由德國新發表之造艦計劃推斷而得、因德國已决定建造二萬六千噸之戰艦、英日兩國為經濟起見、並因兩國本部地勢緊凑、而軍港則遍佈各地、亦竭力設法欲减少艦型至此程度、惟美國軍事專家則因小型戰艦之航行力量、不足穿越重洋、故不能贊成、專家希望法國以後或能建造較巨之戰艦、以抵制德國、因此與美國政策一致、以目前論、歐洲僅意大利一國仍守大艦主義、美國專家深信德國之小型潛艇、不致擾亂他國之海軍、因此種潛艇在德國海岸區外、不足應用也、（九日國民電）</p>

<h3>南拉斯夫攝政　準備聘問羅京　外交沿襲前王政策　新總揆漸得民心</h3>
<p>羅馬尼亞京　南斯拉夫攝政保祿親王聘問羅馬尼亞消息、頃由官方加以證實、該親王茲定於本週之杪、前往西那雅行宮居留三日、國王加洛爾當以上賓之禮待之、為之舉行盛大讌會、並由各閣員參加、據半官方面消息、南斯拉夫故主亞歷山大生前常與加洛爾王相會晤、尤其是外交活動甚為積極之際、必與加洛爾王相接洽、此次保祿親王來遊羅馬尼亞、卽係賡績前王之傳統政策、政界人士以為保祿親王此次與加洛爾王會晤、羅國外長蒂杜樓斯哥亦將參加、結果可使小協商各國政治會議及時舉行、緣此項政治會議原應於六月二十日開會、旋因南斯拉夫葉夫的區內閣辭職、因而展緩以至今茲也、（十日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>貝爾格勒　新總理司徒雅迪漸得民心、行將取得其政敵前總理葉扶第之地位、葉氏於五月總選時共得三百零三席、但於昨日分裂為二、其中二百人提議組織新黨、擁護司徒雅迪總理、故新總理因此將獲得議會三分之二之票數以上、其餘三十五人仍擁護葉氏、尙有六七十人則另組獨立政黨、克羅特反對黨領袖馬嘉仇視國會、蓋馬氏前以為司徒雅迪總理將不顧安內之諾言而繼續採取其前任對付克羅特人之政策也云、（十日國民電）</p>

<p>（倫敦）今日銀價、近遠期相等、尙為本年中第一次、足見美國政府之白銀政策前途實難確定、經營白銀之商人、因見美國之購銀計劃顯有改變、殊覺不安、彼等原來希望美國財部繼續大批購進、故屯積甚多、惟近來則因不能確定、故開始脫手、而銀價遂致暴跌矣、（九日國民社電）</p>
<p>（紐約）英鎊今日已達本年中之最高價、美國則部繼續在倫敦直接購銀　實為其原因、據此間消息、所有在倫敦出售之現銀、已盡為財部照市價購進、財部旣購進如許現銀、當然須購英鎊、故紐約之英鎊價格、亦隨之上升、今日財部在倫敦共購現銀一千五百萬盎斯、三日以來所購總數約在四五千萬盎斯之間云、</p>
<p>（倫敦）美國政府因得英國白銀經紀人之迫切請求、今日曾動用其二十萬萬元之平衡基金、挽救崩毀中之銀市、按今日銀市因各方紛紛售出、尤以遠東方面為甚、陷於僵局、至五十分鐘之久、竟無人購進、而拋空者復猛向市塲攻擊、經紀人不得不展緩規定價格、至美國政府允許購進之後、始定為三十便士二五、此間業已證實美國財部照此價格吸收一千五百萬盎斯之鉅、而銀價之慘跌、亦因此而得阻止云、（九日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）倫敦所傳美國曾動用平衡基金以維持銀價之說、財部今日不願證實、亦不願表示意見、惟政府專家則頗責投機家之不能判斷市塲趨勢、非官塲方面之專家今日以為美國之購進現銀、一方面或因維持價格之穩定、一方面亦因欲免去外間之指摘、謂美國引起銀市之劇變、惟美國在購銀時、為節省起見、照例應求價格低廉、亦屬顯而易見者也、（九日國民電）</p>
<h3>滙豐銀行股息减少　倫敦並不驚異</h3>
<p>滬金融逆潮受美銀政策影響　白銀前途仍為一般注意之點</p>
<p>（倫敦）匯豐銀行之宣布股息、大衆皆以為雖不令人歡迎、但非眞正可驚之事、但記者數人謂觀於今日該銀行股票之跌價、足見市塲初不料發息之减輕也、泰晤士報謂中國貿易日見困難、近復因上海金融逆潮而益增甚、至上海金融逆潮、乃由於美國白銀政策及遠東白銀匯兌不安穩所激成、此雖足鼓勵中國之入口商、但當然於中國貿易發生不利之反響、金融時報謂中國貿易現方低落、每日電聞謂一般匯業必為反常之銀市所妨害云、倫敦人士之意、匯豐銀行發息之减少、殆僅因謹愼起見、而晨郵報則追述一九二九年該銀行所發之息、僅二鎊五先令、白銀前途、今仍為一般人士注意之點、近三日內、出售之總數、估計共有四千萬盎斯、前此之估計、謂多方現處於收買過多之地位、其數達一萬萬盎斯之多、但後皆認不確、今日白銀趨勢更堅、多因售方缺乏之故、衆覺因近事之結果、市况現較穩健、經紀人若干現不解美國收買白銀將繼續幾久、或謂美國白銀政策、乃增多其貨幣存底抬高物價一種切實計劃之一部分、舍美國白銀政策外、日本政策之勢力、與其加於中國之重大壓力、亦為一般人士大事推測之問題、而意見紛紜、莫衷一是、（十日路透電）</p>

<p>簡單的說、就是我們隨時隨地要注重敎育的實施、務使每個國民、都能成為健全的國民、大家要知道、敎育並不限於學校、不要以為學校以外、便無敎育、除學校以外、家庭有家庭的敎育、社會有社會的敎育、我們對於家庭的子弟和一般親戚朋友、以及社會上一般民衆、都有敎育的責任、就是對於我們自己的長輩、如果他們有不適合時代的思想、或自私自利不顧國家民族的心理、也要盡我們勸吿之責、使他們都明白國民的責任、將舊的不好的心理、一概改正過來、我們果能如此盡責、那應社會上所有的民衆、一定都可以奮發有為、造成一個新的社會、建設成為新的國家、這是講大家對於一般民衆所應負的敎育責任、其次、再要將教育的意義和敎育的基本要務、扼要的和大家說一說、所謂敎育、原係包括「敎」與「育」兩件事而言、「敎」是着重一切學術技能與做人的道理之傳授與實習而言、「育」是着重體魄精神道德和生活的保育與訓練而言、「教」與「育」雖然是兩件事、但是彼此實有密切連帶的關係、必須並重兼顧、同時實施、然後才算是完全的敎育、現在一般敎育界的人、往往不明白這個道理、只注重「敎」而不免忽略了「育」、因為敎而不育、結果連敎也敎不好、這種彼跛缺劣的現象、可以說是現在我們中國敎育的通病、就拿四川現在的情形來講、我看四川無論大學中學一般靑年學生的體格、都很瘦弱、精神都很萎靡、和雲南學生比起來、就差得遠、雲南不僅一般男學生、體魄很好、而且一般女學生的體格、也很健全、現在四川一般男女學生的體格、不僅不及雲南、恐怕比較任何一省都不如、這就是山於一般負敎育責任的人敎而不育的結果、這是四川敎育的一個大缺點、也就是我們民挨最大的一個危機、和一般靑年學生最不幸的一件事、希望各位激職員以及已畢業或未畢業的學生、大家要特別注意於精神體魄的鍛鍊、如果精神體魄不能健全起來、不僅不能治學、即任何事情、都不能做、因此我們要使一般學生能够造成功一個健全的人才、必須實施合理的激育、敎與育並重的敎育、關於「敎」的方面、再有廣義與狹義之別、狹養的「敎」、只汴重學術技能的講授、這是很徧頗不完全的敎育、廣義的「敎」、就是我上兩次出席紀念週時所講的要以禮·樂·射·御·書·數·六藝為敎育之基本內容、不僅注重學術的講授、而且注重精神道德的修養和體魄的敎導與鍛錬、也必須如此、才算是實施敎與育兼重之完善的敎育、各位學生現在反省一下、你們現在是不是能完全注重這六藝的修養、是不是已經具備了六藝、比方講禮、形式上各種儀節如立正·舉手·鞠躬·之類、還是小禮、而禮之最要緊的、就是全生活的規律、即古人所謂酒掃·應對·進退、必須洒掃有禮、應對有禮、進退有禮、推而至於一舉一動一言一行、莫不有禮、即莫不有一定的條理和規矩、事事做得盡善定美、現在你們學生、是否都自己洒掃、各地方是否弄得很淸潔很有條理、對於師長、是否尊敬有禮、對於學校的規則紀律、是否遵守、我今天到明遠樓休息、就看見那地方還是很汚穢、你們以為是很淸潔的、其實一點也不淸潔、像這樣連自己一個學校灑掃淸潔都做不到、將來出了學校、又怎麽可以擔任救國救民的責任、古人所謂「一室之不治、何以天下國家為、」可見灑掃雖然是一件小事情、但小事情不能做好、如何可以做治國平天下的大事、所以各位務必由小處做起、做到一切事皆能有禮守法、至於樂的重要、想必大家也都知道、荀子說、「樂者可以善民心、其感人深、其移風易俗、」樂記謂「禮樂刑政、其極一也、所以同民心而出治道也、「都是講音樂對於天下國家治亂安危之重要、由此可知樂是我們救國救民一秤基本的學術和修養、再講到射與御兩件事、除了技術上的價値以外、更可藉以鍛鍊我們的道德精神和體魄、此外書數兩項、現在來講、就是從指文字和數理各門科學、都是我們救國救民所必備的基本學問、廣義的敎、一定要同時以禮·樂·射·御·書·數·六藝為基本內容、而圓滿實施、這是講敎的方面、至於育的方面、現在最凍要的一點、就是要特別注重體育和衛生、現在我們中國、不但一般國民體格日益衰弱、就是一般靑年學生的體格、也同樣的不好、這實在是民族前途莫大的危機、考其原因、雖然很多、而關係最大的做、是一般人不注重體育與衛生、天天坐在房子裏面、毫不運動、連日光也曬不到、空氣又不新鮮、如此、體魄怎麽會好起來呢、體魄不健全、當然沒有健全的精神、旣沒有健全的精神、當然做不出任何健全的事業、所以我們要想為社會國家做一番事業、便不可不首先注重體育和衛生、尤其是一般靑年學生格外要鍛鍊體魄、如果我們個個人都能够加緊鍛鍊、我相信三年以後、大家一定都能盡到救亡復興的責任、如果大家仍舊習於文弱、長此萎靡、恐怕我們的敎育、就是再辦一百年一千年、也於國家民族無所補益、甚至反而貽害無窮、現在外國人為什麼不把我們中國人當作人、駡我們是一批蟲子連禽戰都不如、就是笑我們一般整個國家力量微弱、這是一件何等可恥可痛的事、我們要自保保國、雪恥圖强、必要各個國民先能自强、第一就是要假錬强健的體魄、現在我們實在太不行、你看我們四川七千萬人、每一百個人中可否選得出一個人、其體魄和外國人一樣好、我看恐怕一千個人當中、也不容易選出幾個、國民體魄如此衰弱、平時稍有一點艱苦的事情、已不能做、一日到了外患危迫的時候、雖然憑一時血氣之男能奮身於槍林彈雨之中、但是飢困寒暑之侵、恐不出一兩天、身體使不能支持、試問如何能保國衛民、所以我們民挨不想在世界上圖生存則巳、否則我們大家今後一定要立志自强、尤其是先要趕緊注重體育衛生、務使我們四萬萬同胞、個個身體强健、精神奮發、我們曉得、國家之強弱、與民族之盛衰、即决於極民體魄精與道德之優劣、我們提倡體宵、使國民身體强健起來、目的並不是要以力凌人、不過要自强自立自衛衛國而已、所以我們一方面要有自衛的力量、一方面更要有高尙的道德、就是要恢復我們民族「忠孝仁愛信義和平」之固有道德、也就是要具備我上次所講「智信仁勇嚴」之武德、處處要表演我們全國國民「明禮義、知廉恥、負責任、守紀律」的精神、各位要知道、我們貧弱國家的力量何在、幷不是有多少人口、多少軍隊、就是力量、惟有我們一般國民有强健的體魄、有優越的精神、有高尙的道德、能守紀律、重秩序、明禮知恥、這才是貧弱國家眞正的力量、所以我提倡四句口號、作為我們民族立國之精神的基礎、這四句口號、就是「明禮義·知廉恥·負責任·守紀律、」我們要個個人尙禮守法、見義勇為、負起責任、嚴守紀律、因為一個人如能「明禮義知廉恥」、這個人必能自强、如能「負責任守紀律、」這個人必能自立、如能自立與自强的人、必能不求於人、這種不求於人的人格、比任何的武力都要偉大、現在我們國家這種精神的力量、較之從前、巳經增加很多倍、在數年以前、一般國民只知憑個人血氣之勇、不能如古人所謂「持其志、母暴其氣」、而堅忍奮鬬、到了今天、一般國民普遍的進步、雖然不多、但大多數人已經能守紀律、重秩序、聽命令、大家已能漸漸團結一致、堅忍自强、這不能不算是一種很好的現象、與很大的進步、但是我們要能眞實增强國力、必須如我剛才所講特別注重體育衛生、使我們一般國民、尤其是一般靑年學生、體育與德育智育、同時邁進、然後才能眞正充實國力、國家的基礎、才能穩固、民族的復興、才有把握、總之、現在大家總要知道我們國家危險萬分、而自己國家的力量又不够、所以各人應該如何拼命的學、刻苦的幹、不斷的銀鍊體魄、以造成健全的人才、來報効我們的國家民族、完成革命的使命、最後還有一層要緊的道理、就是敎育應該注重養成勞動的習慣、發揚服務的精神、大家要曉得、敎育和勞動、是不可分離的、如果只學而不勞動、坐言而不起行、任你學間和理想如何好、也不相干、這種學間、就不是眞正的學問、所以「敎」「學」和「做」、應該要合一、而「勞動」「生產」「教育、」實為不解之連環、而其最基本的一點、就是要使一般學生養成勞動的習慣、發惕服務的精神、倘若你們在學校裏不養成勞動的習慣、將來出了學校、一定不能刻苦、不僅不願為公衆服務、結果、做了社會上一個無益而有審的寄生虫、這還算一個眞正受敎育學生嗎、還能做救國救民的帶來嗎、所以我們在學校裏、就要從日常生活中練習勞動、養成習慣、例如前面所講的酒掃一事、就可以作爲養成勞動習慣的一個起點、如果你們賤視勞動、什麽事都不做、甚至現在連箕帚都不願拿起來、將來還可以在疆塲上為國犧牲麽、我們要做救國救民的事業、就是為國為民服務而勞動、古今中外、凡是能成大功立大業的人、未有不習勤耐勞以自苦自勵的、現在我們國家民族、正在危急存亡的時候、若非人人勞動爲社會國家服務、以充實社會國家的力量、何能復興、從此以後、一方面各位大家要以此自勉、一方面更要隨時隨地盡心盡力來敎民一般民衆、使他們都能「明禮義、知廉恥、負責任、守紀律、」人人都能為社會國家勞動服務、以期達到共同救國的目的、以上所講的幾點、就是我們一般敎職員以及各界領袖和社會上一般知識份子應當負的責任和必須身體力行的緊要道理、在此國家興亡的最後關頭、大家應該如何刻苦自勵、振奮有爲、以盡到你們救川救國的責任、我們民族、自黃帝以來、已有五千年光榮的歷史、和最高尙的文化、我們黃炎華靑、實爲世界上最優秀的民族、現在我們不怕我們祖宗的光榮不能恢復、亦不怕國家不能挽救、民族不能復興、而只怕我們不能自立自强、如果大家從此照我所講的意思、一一切實做去、大家便可以無愧爲正正堂堂的中華國民、而且必能建設我四川、創造新國家、復興民族、完成革命的大業（中央社）</p>

<h3>杭州飯莊內　娘子軍大鬧禮堂　舊婦逞威率領娘子軍搗亂　新人奇窘哭笑不得中成婚　程菊夫與姨侄女結婚一幕喜劇</h3>
<p>愛多亞路第七百三十號杭州飯莊、於昨日下午三時三十分發生姨母與姨侄女烯酸吃醋、娘子軍大鬧禮堂事件、此中情形、離奇莫測、茲將各情、紀述於下、</p>
<p>一段舊因緣</p>
<p>有名程菊夫者、字志良、現年二十八歲任本市蘇灘歌劇研究會秘書及私立第一職字學校教務主任、住居法租界敏體尼蔭路恒茂里八十號、其籍貫已不可考、據稱係隸姑蘇、以幼失怗情、故曾由本市孤兒院撫養教讀、以天性聰慧、故成績冠儕輩、會有居住浦東張家浜第一百二戰無不勝號內之丁金林者、以生平僅育四女、長名阿大、嫁與搖船之浦東人張福全為妻、次女名阿二、嫁與向在麺粉交易所經營麺粉交易之湖州商人趙忠魁為妻、三女名三囡、嫁與浦東業打包工頭之唐長庚為妻、惟四女小妹、尚未字人、當時丁氏兩老、為娛晚景及接續宗嗣起見、乃決意至孤兒院內螟蛉一子、領回撫養、并擬即以小妹配之、以續丁氏香煙、</p>
<p>旋又告仳離</p>
<p>及見程菊夫學問優異、乃決意於國民十六年九月二十一日向孤兒院領回作為螟蛉之子、并為四女小妹終身計、遂於是年同月內、挽請住居本市城內西倉橋華興里九號之張君廉及丁之男嫂吳張氏為媒、舉行婚禮、將程招為贅婿、當時程菊夫得此意外奇緣、當亦心滿意足、而夫婦聞情感、亦頗和睦、惟程每以無職業為恨、乃曾商準丁氏兩老來滬謀生、但以機緣難遇、故一無所成、因此居住浦東甚久、在四年前、據稱曾生一子、惟旋即夭亡、而程本人亦時有疾病、故數年來、欲求任事、及至今年四月、始告痊可、據聞程即於斯時與小妹仳離、</p>
<p>竟娶姨姪女</p>
<p>趙忠魁家住南市少年路年順里二十一號、自娶丁氏第二女後、曾育一女乳名菊仙、又名培蘭、現年二十歲左右、容貌　麗、舉止安祥、頗類大家閨秀、而程與趙以誼屬連襟、故彼此時有往還、當今年四月間、程菊夫來申就事後、以來往便利、故往還更密、不時且與趙妻及姨姪女培蘭等出外觀看電影、不料程與培蘭竟會發生戀愛、且恩好達於極點、經兩人籌商之下、遂決於七月十日（即昨日）下午四時、假座愛多亞路二樓大廳、舉行結婚禮、事前遍發請柬、佈置新屋、甚為興奮、并挽人敦請本埠聞人袁履登為之證婚、即本市要人等、亦有喜聯致賀、而禮堂上更為佈置得富麗堂皇、親朋滿座、咸是一片祝頌聲、</p>
<p>禮堂作戰場</p>
<p>誰料好事未成、忽來橫禍、當在昨日下午三時三十分許、禮堂內正在佈置儀式秩序時、樓上忽有一頭戴白草帽之中年男子、怱遽而上、走入禮堂聲稱招尋程志良說話、身後又隨有中年女子數十名、聲勢洶洶、齊聲向程索取債款、當時程菊夫知事不妙、亟擬走避、而一班賀喜親戚、恐肇事端、乃急將來者婉言勸阻、但一班娘子軍決不讓步、非令程即時還款不辦、正擾攘間、該丁小妹亦姍姍而來、及見諸人爭論不決、竟大吼一聲、全行動手、於是禮堂內頓成戰場、玻杯與花籃賀聯等齊飛、叮噹碎碟之聲、權充了婚禮前奏曲、而一班娘子軍打得性起、亦顧不到自己髪散衣破、香汗雨下、　祇苦了新娘趙培蘭、竟嚇得縮做一團、</p>
<p>捉入巡捕房</p>
<p>當時旁人亦無從勸阻、幸內中有一程之友人乘機溜出、恐釀巨禍、乃亟用電話、報告捕房請援、當時由捕房指派大批探捕及警備車趕往彈壓、則見一班娘子軍尚在大試身手、更以人多口雜、一時難明真相、乃將為首諸婦女及新郎程菊夫·新娘趙培蘭·丁小妹趙忠魁夫婦·等、一併帶入捕房、經訊問之下、據丁小妹所供、則一如上述、惟據程菊夫供、則稱先前確與小妹結合、嗣後以雙方意見不合、已賦仳離、且曾刊登民報及新聞報廣告聲明、有案可查、此次丁小妹所作所為、實係無理取鬧、有意損毀本人名譽、應請究辦、</p>
<p>怱怱補婚禮</p>
<p>捕房核供後、以彼此言詞各執、孰是孰非、應得提出證據、依法究辦、而一班趨賀親朋、見事成僵局、乃亦相率散去、禮堂中僅留樂隊一班及程之知友數人、分坐四隅、共商善後、并將所有花籃等略為修整、仍荼諸原處、當記者離開該處時、尚無妥善辦法、直至六時許始有成議、至其事實如何不難明白、惟吉日良辰、奚能錯過、乃相率聯名具保、請求準許新郎新娘暫時交保出外結婚、適捕房方面、亦以丁小錄并無證據提出、予以不受理、新郎新娘乃於哭笑不得中、偕赴杭州飯莊之補行婚禮、乘車回寓、今晨是否將與丁小妹對薄公庭、容待續誌、</p>

<p>余於民十六年奉命掌理本校、迄今歷時八載、其時適値本校學潮初平百端待理、余與法校長薛藩共同商酌、一意經營使莘莘學子、得以妥心響學、而校務亦以之日臻進境、今則大學四年級、均已辦理完成、高中三年級曁法文補習班循序遞升、而學生畢業後、或留學國外、或服務社會、均有專長、各具成績、余等八年來之苦心、擊畫至此、稍見寸効、為功為罪、見仁見智、均非所計、惟有一本過去服務之精神、繼續努力、第以本校、係由中法雨國政府合辦環境與設施、均屬特殊情形、間有為國人所未明瞭者、因將過去之工作、未來之計劃、擇要臚述如左、</p>
<p>（一）本校之沿革　在民國紀元前四年、有德醫名寳隆者Raulun來滬行醫、縣壺之餘、購地數畝、建屋數椽、設帳授徒、是為本校創設之濫觴、其後寶隆氏所收生徒日多、乃成立私立醫學校、斯時德領事虎拉甫Knappe、鑒於寶隆氏辦學成績頗佳、乃取得其同意、向德政府提議、將私立醫校、加以擴充設醫工兩科、改組為德國國立大學、經德政府核准於民國紀元前四年六月三日、正式成立、是為同濟大學、仍由寳隆氏任校長、民國紀元前二年、寳降病故、將其私產悉數捐入校中繼任校長名斯却波Schab民國三年、歐戰發生同濟停辦斯却波去職、迨戰事吿終、訂定凡爾賽和約於第一百三十四條、載明一德國放棄在上海法租界所有之德國國立同濟大學、全部校產與中法兩政府　法政府根據此條約、遂與中國政府、商定繼續共同辦理辦法、定名為中法國立通惠工商學校、設工商兩科、中法政府各派校長一人、中國校長為張保熙、法爾校長名梅鵬Maybon民國十年三月十日正式改組成立、遠近學子、負笈前來者、達四百餘人、不幸至民十一年風潮迭起、校務因之停頓、於是停辦商科、更改校名為中法國立工業專門學校、翌年張保熙辭職、暫由敎務長胡文耀代理、校長職務、其後梅鵬亦相繼辭職、由法政府派薛藩Civet繼任、中政府亦正式任命朱炎為校長、校務進行、口益發達、迨至民十六年三月二十一日、國民革命軍抵定上海之初、各校風潮迭起、本校未能倖免、朱炎因之去職、足年四月、由國民政府大學院、派民誼為校長、民國小八年奉部令更改為中法國立工業專　學校、旋又以年牧及課程、與敎部所頒新章程抵觸、於二十年呈部、請改為獨立學院、奉部令照准、於九月一日、正式改為中法國　工學院院長、仍由民誼與薛藩担任、</p>
<p>（二）本校辦學方針及學生留學概况本校為中法兩國共有之唯一國立敎育文化機關、負有實際溝通中法敎育文之職責、在火舉為創制與普通國立學校、一切組織設施、稍有不同、以故辦學方針、有可得而言者、本校為工業專科、當然以養成高深工業人才為目的、惟因與法方合作、故一切課程編制、均參照法國大學、制度管理、絕對嚴格、不稍假借、各科課程、均以法語、直接講解敎授、及講師除聘有法國學騐俱深之土、分担各課外、其餘均係我國切學法比之優秀份子、學生入校肄業、第一年進法文補習班、翌年升入高中一年級、即可直接聽講法語、此後依次遞升、至於大學畢業留學國外、更圖深造、固屬學有餘裕、其服務社會者、不僅法文精通、且各具有工業專長、尢能措施裕如、惟是本校考試、採取嚴格主義、學生學年考試不及格者、斷難升學、絕無通融、而各門課程繁多非加意用功頭埋苦幹不可、且尤注重實習工廠機械電汽設備俱全、每星期實習之時間、與年俱增、班次愈高、則實習愈多、以故人學必具决心磨練、乃能成器、至於學費、大學部每學期僅收二十五元、中學部十五元、住宿完全免費、學生能自撙節、則連同膳食書籍等費、每年百數十元巳足、且學期考試名列前二名者、免收學費、故在本校肄業者、多數勤苦自動之學生、而本校亦以儉樸耐勞為訓育方針、</p>

<h3>惟團結纔能自救（貢獻話）</h3>
<p>— 仰葊</p>
<p>國貨工廠在這千鈞一髮危難潮流中，惟一自救，祇有團結力量。彼此合作，纔有存在的希望。跌價傾銷，是損人不利己的行為，何苦如此。這一週問國貨界的好氣象，倒有幾種：（一）是酒精同業的組織聯合售品所，（二）是橡膠同業的節制產額，（三）是造紙同業的注意稅則，（四）是江蘇全省國貨同業的大結合。尤其可以欣慰的，是上海市商會的工商業復興委員會的成立。該會集各方的專家，議决的工作程序，先從調查四十一業的國貨工業入手而注意於統計，研究，指導，訓練等項工作。譬諸治病，先探求病原之所在，而後纔投適當有效之藥劑，以達復興之目的。公認為調究主要工作，應注意於營業不景氣原因之何在，繼能定救濟之方案。就在座委員提出之點歸納之，則有（一）資本過少，（二）行莊利息太高，（三）　費太多，開支太巨，以致成本過高。　會計制度之不良，（五）管理方法之不合，（六）推銷之不努力，（七）採辦原料之吃虧等等。這都是需要研究指　的工作，不是一業一廠的事，實在是全工業的生死問題。最需要大家有團結力量一致進行的。</p>
<h3>請政府速撤轉口稅（國貨論壇）</h3>
<p>— 玄萬</p>
<p>數年來蓬勃一時的國貨運動，到現在還始終沒有較好的成績出來，這原因雖說是多面性的，可是，因於轉口稅和出口稅的還未裁撤，使阻礙了國貨順利的進行，的確也是一個最大的原因，而這次——最近財部曾建議中央，分別减免出口稅與轉口稅，並於五月二十日立法院審查修正通過，現减免出口稅辦法，已於上月二十六日正式公布，確是國貨前途的一個福音，但，本定七月一日起實行裁撤的轉口稅則，却遲遲其行，又沒有消息，眞不勝我們的喁喁之望，同時，也就發動了我寫本文的動機。</p>
<p>大家曉得，外貨過去的能傾銷我國市塲，他唯一的依賴，就是以關稅協定作護符，他們的商品入口時，祗須完納正稅一道，就可以在我國內地各處自由銷行，通行無阻，並可以平衡其各地售價，無孔不入的肆行傾銷，但是，我們自己呢？要把國貨輸入一點到內地去，過境有關，越省有卡，在在需要去完納稅捐，經過重重疊疊手績上麻煩，而為了運輸稅餉的關係，因此，他的售價，也就不得不跟着所納稅金的高低，像水漲船高地抬高其本價，例如在上海買四五角一隻的搪瓷面盆，於西安，蘭州，重慶，昆明等地，非買至八九角不可，甚至有在一元以上者，所以，在這樣的束縛情形下，國貨自難以發展，簡直也就無法去和洋貨相抗衡。</p>
<p>現在，我們再看各國徵稅的現况，就近代國家捐稅的理論言，轉口稅也為一種十分不合理的稅則，因為，國家一方面果以稅收為經常的收入，但同時却也含有保護他本國經濟的原則，世界各國對於國內已有代替品，和一般奢侈品的輸入，無不重徵其稅，至於對於國內貨物的流通，發展，却不僅豁免稅則，並要用種種政治上的力量，去竭力扶持，以鼓勵其進行，雙管齊下的策略，使外貨在本國就無從立足，入超問題有了救濟。</p>
<p>總之，目下中國經濟的國難，這樣嚴重，我們曉得唯一圖在的方法，只有「提倡國貨」，而在努力國貨運動的現階段上，請政府速撤轉口稅，正式明令公布，却也成了我們目下最渴望的一點，我們要拿這一個寶鑰，來解除全國工商業的困難，來啟發提倡國貨的新生機。</p>
<h3>夏令飲料的小海關（國貨談話）</h3>
<p>— 肖白</p>
<p>我常會這樣癡癡地呆想，一個國家的國民，為什麼要連口中所吃的東西，也須他人供給呢？那簡直不僅單是不愛國的問題，並且他是忘掉了自己生存在世間的風利和義務，這種情形，實在不是一個獨立國家國民所有的現象，一個有血性的人們，他是决不肯把大好的金錢，就在貪圖口腹中，白白地甘願送給人家的，而在我國社會上，却儘是「司空見慣」，那眞是一個「可痛之謎」吧！</p>
<p>這幾天天氣又在熱起來，市上舶來的飲料，食品，行見漸漸地充斥，據過去的事實的昭示，我們是可很淸晰地曉得，舶來冷飲品的在夏天，正是一個大量傾銷好機會，什麼汽水啊！啤酒啊！橘子水啊！冰洪淋呵！在許多酒館飯店裏，往往成了他們獨佔的市塲，可以說十之八九，都是十足道地的洋貨，具有着一種牢不可破的潛勢力，那眞是十二分地要不得，假使這種現象再延續下去，大海關再進小海關，一定將會整個的撲滅我們的生命。</p>
<p>關於國人會吃舶來飲食的原因，我也嘗細細地研究過，大概可以分二類來說，第一種人是貧小，他們因了洋貨的價格較為低廉而去光顧，第二種人是馬虎，他們糊裏糊塗的吃了再講，或老是好像不屑細顧，洋貨上了嘴還沒知道，並且都以為一個人口中所吃的，是十分有限而無礙大局，他們那裏曉得自小而大，「涓滴之水，可成江河，」「星星之火，可以燎原，」於平常的時候，也許誰也想不到他就會促成中國經濟於致命傷，但，整年累月的結果，却就曉傳這個創傷的利害了。</p>
<p>所以，在最後，我敢很肯切地提出，在目下，我們只有希望大家能把這個問題急切地注意起來，有的努力糾正過去的錯誤，無的加勉，好在現下國貨冷飲品中，如益利汽水，冠生國果子露，無敵牌鮮橘水等，淸潔衛生，價格低廉，樣樣可勝過洋貨，那又何必戀戀於舶來，在這裏，我願大家更切記着德國實施國貨運動的二句名言：「不要把外國食品放在你的桌子上，」「眞正給我們精力者，祗有我們自己的麵包，水果和啤酒」，請大家千萬的當心，不要再有舶來飲食進你的口。</p>
<h3>吳稚暉先生提倡國貨談（國貨故事）</h3>
<p>— 汪瘦秋</p>
<p>吳稚睴先生最近講了一個故事，那故事是說：在嘉道年間，他有一個外戚女子嫁了一個丈夫，過了些日子，這個丈夫忽然失了業，對於一家的生活，當然是無法維持，於是他就專門替人家做些針線，賺幾個錢來貼補家用。但是因為收入少的綠故，每天只吃兩餐，雖然吃了早餐還沒有下餐，他也决不向人家告貸。有時候沒有飯吃，他還用布屑塞在爐灶裏燒着，使烟囱裏冒着烟，也像煮飯的樣子。他丈夫雖然祗是一件靑布大褂，但是總漿洗得平平整整，决沒有一點痕跡的。像這樣子過了十八年，他丈夫才找到事，當然，他們的家境也就好起來了！</p>
<p>他這個故事的用意，是說我們中國在這經濟窘迫的當兒，也應該倣傚他這種精神，自己刻苦，不要仰給外人，更不要替人家推銷洋貨，把可以作為農工商業資本的現金糟蹋了，如果一致的刻苦，自然也可以像那個外戚女子一樣的苦盡甘來。我們對於這個故事，眞是非常的感動，在現在的中國經濟，已經到了亳無辦法的時期了，我們要挽救這經濟的枯窘；渡過這經濟的難關；除掉提倡國貨，不用洋貨以外，簡直沒有辦法，所以一般有識的人士，都高喊着提猖國貨，服用國貨的口號，無如中國人是慣好享用的，因為外國貨的玲瓏巧妙，都紛紛的去採用外貨，於是大批的現金，往外國流去，而中國的工商業受着這種影響，遂造成經濟枯窘的現象，這眞是十分痛心的事！</p>
<p>現在，中國的國貨事業，經國人們的努力，總算有了相當的進步，我們很希望國人們都去學那嘉道年間的一個女子，自己來刻苦自勵，好的國貨，固然應該探用，就是稍為次一點的國貨，也應該忍耐購用，千萬不可借重外貨，要知道購用外貨，不啻是自趨死路，聰明的中國人，似乎不應該作那自掘墳墓的愚蠢事吧？</p>
<h3>夏令國貨用品的檢討（國貨調查）</h3>
<p>— 張孟昭</p>
<p>學生國貨年，在這國家危急的當兒，他的責任愈重！他的使命愈迫切！歲月不居，所謂「學生國貨年」逝去半載矣！</p>
<p>吾人檢視過去，瞻念未來，誠有不寒而慄者！梅雨方過，酷暑已臨！國貨的活躍與暑假學生運動之努着先鞭！惟在此時。余因作「夏令國貨用品的檢討一文，煙云本刋。</p>
<p>衣的方面　同亞的輕縐美羅，鴻新的輕凉布疋，三友的汗巾浴衣，五和的鵝牌汗衫，又如盛紡·杭紡·廣東雲紗·萬載夏布·服之異常適禮。</p>
<p>吃的方面　本國白米香粥之外，泰康·冠生園的麵包，蘇打餅乾·各種菜子露·蒃荳糕·並自製的蒃荳湯·益利汽水·烟臺啤酒·三樂和奉化的蜜桃·上虞楊梅·四鄉的三白西瓜·石塘灣的靑皮綠肉甜香瓜等……</p>
<p>用的方面　亞浦耳的綠色小電泡。華生風扇·立鶴牌搪瓷器皿·三星牌蚊烟香·三友社三星牌無敵牌的香皂·各種香水·爽身粉·三角牌西湖毛巾·中國化學工業社的醬油精·天廚味精·五洲的固本皂·蠅殺倒，其餘如儉樸實用的大蒲屬·濮蓆等……</p>
<p>上述的「夏令國貨用品」不過就記者所記憶牢的寫出來貢獻給讀者，尚有許多的國貨，值得介紹在夏令的，還書不勝書，我希望國人因我的拙作而寫些出來，互相介紹報告，使同胞注意牢記，那於今年的國貨前途，不無裨益吧！</p>
<h3>鎭江制止國貨城商塲營業的感言（貢獻意見）</h3>
<p>— 巴玲</p>
<p>最近，報上發現下面一段消息，我認為值得提出來討論一下的，愛為轉載於下，并發表我個人對於這件事情的管見。</p>
<p>「鎭江各業同業公會，因上海國貨城商塲擬來鎭短期營業，特聯名致函商會，略謂國貨小廠商，假借名義，來省矇請官廳，設塲競賣，比年屢見不鮮，其貨品亦極平常，為各商號所已有，其價值以取得免關免稅，運費低廉之便利，可以削減招徠，藉以吸取現金，推銷積貨，為期雖暫，內地商家，受害實非淺鮮，值此商塲不景氣時期，以地方養地方，生意且一落千丈，何堪再受外來侵蝕云，該會據函後，頃已電呈省縣黨政機關，請嚴予制止以維市面，而恤商情云云。」</p>
<p>我看了這段消息之後，不禁悵然者久之！我覺得這是國貨前途的一個值得討論的問題，現在姑日站在客觀的地位，把這件事情，做一個簡單的解部</p>
<p>（甲）就國貨城商塲方面說：國貨城商塲，此次到鎭營業的目的，無疑的是推銷國貨，這個正當而合理的宗旨：似乎是不可加以非議的。不過就我看來，國貨城商塲到鎭江去營業，至少應該注意下面幾點，那才不致受到當地商家的反對。（共實，不論到什麽地方設塲營業，下面幾點，總是要設法顧到的。）</p>
<p>（一）須在事先與當地商會，同業公會等團體，徵求同意。</p>
<p>（二）售價須與當地貨物相等，庶不致因國貨城商塲營業，而受到不良的影響。</p>
<p>（三）貨物須眞正著名國貨工廠的出品，庶不致為人所非議。</p>
<p>（乙）就鎭江商界方面說：就鎭江商界，同業公會，以及鎭江商會方面說，我認為也須注意下面歡項，那末，對於今後如有同樣事件發生，一定可以减少許多無謂的糾紛。</p>
<p>（一）必須認淸國貨城商塲來鎭營業的目的，是在提倡國貨，實傳國貨，推銷國貨；是一種善意，并不是一種惡意。</p>
<p>（二）為避免國貨城商場貨品廉價傾銷起見，對於售價一層，最好於事先代為規定，俾免當地貨品，受廉價傾銷的影響。</p>
<p>（三）在國貨城商塲末來之先，最好將鎭江所需要的貨物，開具淸單，通函報告，這樣定能免除鎭江當地商界的反感，同時，還能得到當地商界以及民衆的意外的歡迎呢？</p>
<p>根據上述意見，我相信雙方如能照此做去，互相諒解的合作起來，不但能减免這種不幸的糾紛，而且說不定還有一種意外的收穫發見呢？未知讀者和當事者，以為然否？</p>
<h3>振興江西瓷業之商榷（國貨討論）</h3>
<p>— 梁英鐘</p>
<p>磁器為日用必需之品。用途甚廣。而江西所產。尤為我國國粹之一。發明最古。於國產品中。佔有悠久之歷史。其質美品優。精巧細緻。出自天然。允稱絕倫。遠非他處所產者。可與比擬。故能為人樂用，到處歡迎。更有古磁珍品，年代愈久，愈增貴重，人多喜收集珍藏，以供玩賞，以是行銷中外，全球馳名，大足為國貨增光。惜近年以來，因外貨充斥，及其他影響，致使此具有歷史價值之國磁，兌一落千丈，瀕於破產之危境，言之痛心！不佞厠身磁業，經歷有年，對於箇中情形，知之頗諗，因筆述其詳，以嚮關心國產事業者，親以指導，俾謀改進，以資提倡。</p>
<p>磁業之產地，為江西之景德鎭，處於皖贛邊境，叢山環抱，河狹水淺，運磁之船，不能直達，皆泊於饒州以下，磁貨輸出，均以小駁載往大船，輾轉起卸，易遭破碎，損失甚鉅，故對於交通運輸，亟有整理之必要。總理所著建國方略中，曾有將磁窰移設廬山山麓之計劃，蓋亦以交通上之關係也。</p>
<p>磁器出境，曩本逢卡納厘，捐稅甚繁，自政府裁厘令下曾一度取消，未幾贛省府又以產銷稅之名義，仍按原例，復事征收，同時科稅者，有紙茶等六項，皆在其列，雖經奔走呼籲，一再請願，亦亳無效果。乃者聞其餘五項，均已撤消，而磁稅猶存，依然照納，似此措施，殊欠平允，尤非愛護國貨之道，深望政府當局，體恤商艱，令將該項稅局，迅予撤去，以維國貨，不禁翹企盼禱，以祝其早達實現。</p>
<p>我國磁器之製造，自昔皆用人工，迄今相沿，猶未改良，故出貨遲鈍，而成本綦重，兼之舊法燒窰，火候不勻相失尤重，而外磁皆以機製，迅速便利，整齊美觀，萬倍於我，國磁難與抗衡，不言可知。且我國又無保護稅則，任其侵略，充斥於市，以致國磁受其影響，一蹶不振，漸以衰落，外磁之中，其餘諸物，姑置勿計，單就各種菜盆一項言之，如各處酒樓菜館，宴會席間，除少數粤籍菜館，問有採用國磁之外，其餘所用盆碟，滿桌陳列，莫非外磁，馴至家庭日用，亦觸目皆是，故其銷數之鉅，已超過國磁全部營業總額以上，誠足令人驚駭。為今之計，如欲挽救國磁之頽局，必須研究改良，易以機製，庶幾可與外貨競爭，尚有轉機之望，否則前途險象，汲汲可危，誠有不堪設想者矣。</p>
<p>全國磁商，大多均係鄂人，散處各省都山鎭邑，為數甚夥，而上海一埠，素有全國磁業領袖之稱，邑廟城廂一帶，尤為業中精粹所在，店肆林立，規模宏大，不特為本市營業之淵藪，卽各埠客帮批發，歐美出口，亦多集中採辦，貿易之盛，冠於全國。惜業中向乏團結，各自為謀，極形散漫，故每事因循相襲，絕少改良進化，致遭外磁傾軋，幾入淘汰之途，值此危亡之際，而猶不知警悟，復有無知分子，不詳察致敗之由，以謀根本救濟之法，反舍本逐末妄運鉅量下等次貨，濫價號召，吸引購衆，乘機擾亂，自為得計，不知貨質窳劣，雖價賤何益，結果使用戶對於國磁，愈不滿意，更致見棄於人，益予外磁以進改之機會，似此顛倒荒謬，不徒無補實際，竟如飲鴆止渴，自速其亡。我故曰，欲解决國磁之危機，在於努力直進，改良造法，以輕成本，而廉售價，及提高價質，改善出品，以合潮流，而便推銷，雙方兼頗，以達價廉物美之眞義，用堅外界之信仰，則磁業難關，不難打破，前途勝利，可操左券，質諸磁業當道，以為何如。</p>
<p>綜上所述，江西磁業失敗之主要原因，已略盡於此，誠能斟酌情形，困難者予以解除，不善者加以改進，則扶搖直上，日臻發達，固意中事也。將來風行所至，掃除一切外磁之縱跡，更向外側銷，為國貨界放一異彩，豈僅磁業前途之幸，而國家利權之挽回亦有所賴，尚乞海內高明，不吝賜敎，以利進行，更盼國人熱烈擁護，共同提倡實所厚望。（通訊處上海民國路吉祥街對面梁萬發磁號）</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （肖白）</p>
<p>在最近來那些所謂文藝刋物上，我老是看到一些無聊的詩句，什麼「靑春的慾火啊！燃燒起來了，一顆愛的心泉關不住了。」這種十分肉麻的話，看了簡直使人頭痛，欲作三日嘔，可是，在這裏，却也因此使我想起一首舊詩來，記得原文是這樣：「十八嫁郎君，十九郎君出，二十不歸來，今年二十一，」這是以同樣意義和內容的描寫，但，後者是如何有力，在字句的表現上，足以透入讀者的心坎，富有含蓄的寫作，無怪膾炙人口，而使人永遠不會忘記了。</p>

<p>本來，國以民為本，民以食為天，我們要談建國，必須先蘇民困，使民衆人人安居樂業，無衣食之憂；然而我們在尚未提及怎樣可以蘇民貧困之前，首先要提倡護農。因為先要健實了農村，纔能够充裕民食，民食旣足，國糈自然有恃無恐；等到年有積穀，民食無憂的時候，民衆自然生活安定，努力生產，建設，樂其所業，安其所居了。現在意首相墨老頭兒，不惜親赴農鄉，參加打麥工作，並且照領工資：這種提倡農業的精神，怎樣的偉大啊！</p>
<p>查我國原是以農立國的國家，土質肥沃，氣候溫和，山川地利之富厚，土貨物產之豐盈，向執世界之牛耳。卽以我全國人口計之，農人佔到十分之七以上；由此，可見得農業在我國悠關國計民生之重要了。無奈在過去的我國，內亂頻仍，外侮未已，天災相侵，人禍汜濫。都市商業已為世界經濟恐慌，與夫不景氣之高潮所激盪，幾年以來，隄潰口决無法挽救；是以百業蕭條，購買力日見薄弱。同時農村中亦因兵燹匪禍，接踵相擾，萑符遍地，盜匪如毛，哀鴻遍野，餓殍載道，農村經濟崩潰已經到達了尖端；現在每一個人民饔餐尚在不繼，遑論其他，所以我主張：欲言救國者須先安民，安民之道還應當先從救濟農業，保讓農村起。但我以為要這樣做，非改良農民生活，普及農民敎育，增進生產効能不可。</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十六回　廉幕隱啼痕難逃冷眼衣冠誇幸運曾到權門</p>
<p>小西天裏，除了我，還有誰肯管這種閑事的？我去，只有我去。想到了這地方，那是什麼也顧不得的了，這就披衣下床，開了房門向院子裏走着。在沒有電燈的世界裏，到了晚上兩點鐘，什麼地方，也是漆黑一團。志前摸摸索紫的走到屋子外走廊上。不知道脚下碰翻了一種什麼瓦器，便聽得柱子邊嗆啷一下響。立刻站定了脚，向四週旅客的屋子看看。這也只是那玻璃窗裏，放出那昏黃的燈光，此外除了一兩個客人鼾睡的鼻呼聲，並無其它的影響。志心前退了兩步，靠牆站定，靜靜的想了一想。他自念着，我這不是有些匆嗎？我這個抱不平，却是怎麼樣子去打。就算月英在那裏抵抗着他，然而他已經把銀錢買了他的身子，他自然可以支配他，一個同住旅館的人，就是別人嫖賭抽大烟，也汶有法子干涉，何况人家還是堂堂正正的娶姨太太呢？自己這樣的轉彎想了一想，便向屋子裏退了去。好在這樣夜深，便是十進十出，也不會有人感覺。也幸得有了這一番舉動，這才把枕頭上那些胡思亂想，作了一個結束，然後倒上床安然睡覺。本來在次日早晨，是不能够起來得早此的。無如隔壁住的那位張介夫一早就大聲說話，沒有停止，這就讓他吵醒了。朦朧中就聽到他連連稱了好幾聲應長。及至清醒過來，把他話聽得淸楚。(二六二）</p>
<h3>舞女自述</h3>
<p>— 憶秋</p>
<p>我的生活，是從男人們的懷抱中得來的，每當夜慕展開的時候，我必艷抹濃裝，打扮成一個最美麗的玩具一樣送到那金迷紙醉的舞塲去給少爺們享受。</p>
<p>當我初進舞塲時，那些男子們都不甚注意我，舞縐的老闆，囑我要在「笑」字上用功夫。</p>
<p>我對於「笑」字研究了好幾個月，他們居然漸漸地注意我了，進益也漸入佳境了，可是，我的處女的淸白，也就斷送在這個「笑」字上面。</p>
<p>有一晚，我正在那燦爛的霓紅燈下賣弄風騷表演着我的「笑」的功夫時，驟然有一個西裝少年走近前來，將我的手一拉，我就趁勢倒在他的懷裏，隨着音樂的節奏，在光滑的地板上動蕩着，動蕩着，一次，二次，不斷地動蕩着。</p>
<p>他將我的腰，緊緊地摟着，將我的髮，頻頻地吻着，我知道，他已沉醉在我的香霧裏了，啊！香水精的功勞！</p>
<p>我當時，覺得很典奮而榮幸，居然有一個上等男子（？）來擁抱我，同時，我又很詫異，為什麼一個男人摟抱卷一個女人算是交際？啊！神秘的都市！</p>
<p>從此，他每晚必定來擁抱我幾十次，開香檳，坐檯子，他在我身上着實化了些錢。</p>
<p>有一天晚上，他突然對我說：「請你散了塲到一品香二〇八號房間來一次！」我當時雖然很是疑慮，但終於迅速地答應了他，因為，他是我唯一的飯碗啊</p>
<p>從一品香那晚以後，我整整地痛哭了幾天，懊惱，怨恨，密密地交織在心頭，到這個時候，我才澈底地明白了，我不是人；我是少爺們的玩具；我是大都會的點綴品！從此，竇貴的童貞，也和我永別了！</p>
<h3>今物古稱續誌</h3>
<p>— 汪敏</p>
<p>今官署又盛行用密告箱，此物古名缿筩，曾見漢書趙廣本傳。至於官家用物，法令古稱令甲，公文古稱榜子，又匿戶信件，古稱飲章，均是古籍。</p>
<p>布帛之屬，今物古稱者，凡典籍中，尤為數見，如夏布古稱白越，以棉紗織成者，古稱白疊，亦多班可考也。</p>
<p>舟人所用之縴繩，古名百丈，繅絲少具古名孳車。上山輿人所用以載令爬山虎，古名復輿。是皆今代工具之古稱矣。</p>
<p>市上有售竹製手形，用以搔癢之物；按卽古代之如意也。長卅呂種至著言中；曾記有關於如意一文，略云：古時或用骨角竹木削作拿指爪，用此搔癢，惟後來如意之狀，改作雲頭屈曲者，不知起於何時耳？</p>
<p>宋時有克絲，通作刻絲，定州織之。不用大機，以熟色輕于木掙上，隨所欲，作花草禽獸樓閣，以小梭布緯時，先留其處，以雜色綫綴于經緯之上合以成文，極其工巧，今杭州都錦生，以絲織風景聞名，或亦刻絲之遺意也。</p>
<p>嚴子，古有名曰穴骼，宋代宮中，又有倒擲戲者，以至作橄攬狀，只觚而刻，二三四五六，推旋于玉盆中，久而方倒，中其數者為勝，亦卽今之骰子矣。</p>
<p>附誌　前月載本刋拙著「今物古稱」，第一行水下脫上字，又二五行，末字，屨誤屐，又五六行箭誤篆，並以更正。</p>
<p>醉痴生來函，讀二十九日貴刊「御香縹緲錄小說：述御醫為太后治病一段。說：「四位御醫，便分着兩邊。每一邊各兩人，十分謹愼地伸出手來。用指尖隔着絹帕，靜心為太后按脈。……他們旣不用時錶來計算脈搏的次數，僅憑五個指頭按着。怎麼能知道病人的病情呢？……隔了半嚮，左右兩邊的御醫，又悄悄地互相對調了過去。」查醫家按脈，統用三指，何用五個指頭？又三指按脈，適當「寸關尺」三個部位。每邊各兩人，又何能同時並按？但照上述情形：好像是兩人同時按脈的。總之這兩點，也是個小小的錯誤吧。</p>
<p>姐在河邊採紅菱，落晚金釵無處尋，阿有人拾得金釵來還我青紗帳裡來報你的恩！</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>一個沒有病的人而强迫他，和有病的人一起服藥，這未免是太專制些了！而且我覺得很危險，難道一個好好的人無端喝了這一杯藥，就不會引起什麼反響嗎？但據後來太后告訴我：遙　不合人情的章程，已是幾百年前遺下來的了，並非是太后所特創的；它的用意是要防範那些當御醫的人，受了賄賂，在藥中加上什麼毒物，企圖圖暗殺皇上或太后，像這樣先敎他們自己當在喝過了，便可不用再害怕，好在這些醫生當退出去之後，儘可自己另外喝些藥，以維護他們本身的健康。（這裏還有一個聲明：讀者也許以為如今的中國藥鋪子裏，可以不聞有什麼可以殺人的毒藥，皀使有，也不容易給人們買到：可是在從前時候，殺人的毒藥是很多而很容易得到的，像鶴頂紅就是其中之一。）</p>
<p>雖然太后已是司空見慣了，但眼看那四位御醫如此乾脆的把藥喝下去，也險些失聲大笑了。</p>
<p>「這不是太詫異啦！他們喝得怪爽利的，像是這藥全沒苦味的樣兒。」老佛爺據着那個玉碗，彷彿打趣似的笑道：「然而我可不相信，這藥那裏會有不苦的道理」？（三六二）</p>
<p>遊踪所至</p>
<h3>西湖消夏</h3>
<p>— 無涯</p>
<p>西湖風景，以西泠為最佳，背山面湖，如在青綠書中，非若新市塲之一望而盡也。前年住息養社，嘗有白荷花香上樓來之句：靈兒晴霎兒雨霎兒雷之三曼句，尤不能忘。但祇十日勾留，熱至九十七度，逃署而歸。今年重到西泠，住蝶來飯店，熱至八十七度，在梅雨中，亦不覺其燠悶，並無蚊蠅，飲食起居，頗感舒適，蓋其建築設備，悉趨歐美最高等化也。予與內子同居一室，內容兩榻并有浴室及冲水團與盥具等，護牆及地悉用磁磚，淸潔勝於家庭。白衣侍者均諳西語，洒掃之役，別有靑衣。明窓凈几，絕無織麈，紗窓外有紅廊可坐，草地一方，修廣達千餘方尺，凉棚高爽，繞以迥廊一匝，如吳友如所畫。南望西湖，山重水複，柳暗花明，不　在大觀園中，佔得怡紅一院，而其實尤且過之。蓋紅樓中無此大假山與池也。同樣舒適之室甚多，住客大都為高尚人物，寂靜無譁。惟聞烏語終日不斷，而扁舟出沒於柳絲林杪間，有如活動寫眞，山水烟雲，尤復時時變幻，相對匝月，未嘗厭倦。予在滬上本住醫院，以不便故移此，其賃值本為七元，因與論月，僅收六折，兩入膳食一日四餐，合共兩元四角而已，可謂經濟之至。吾友夫婦兩人，住三層樓，尤為經濟，膳費僅廿元一月，其房金則一元半耳。開窓面湖，所見尤為遼遠，據謂雪月之夜，尤佳。因念新家庭制省儉亦無逾此，蓋其侍者呼應極週，但一按鈴，即至。中西飲食無不精潔，雖深夜凌晨，亦可咄嗟立辦。其會餐室尤為華麗明觀，食後散坐，則有閱報之室，收音機及小高而夫，亦足以供娛樂。散步則有濃綠之園，沿湖垂釣，或泛遊艇，尤繞佳趨。蓋其地處西湖之中心點，迤東則為孤山白堤，迤西則為蘇堤六橋，備有汽車三輛，可達玉泉靈隱，車中設有收音機，一路笙歌，直把杭州作汁州矣。其隣有影戲院，有圖書館，故吾以為大觀園之享受，必不能過於此。予嘗乘輿游山三日，泛於西溪一日，自溯生平游踪所至，已歷五國十一省，所謂西湖名勝甲天下，洵非虛譽，但在都市中生活者，殊不能領略耳。</p>

<h3>糧食　國內小麥年成不足　美麥黑斑蔓延頗大</h3>
<p>小麥市面、上午開盤、各月份曾高漲三五六分之巨、因洋麥旣回漲一元零、水災區域、仍未回原狀、故業內外人心、之帶動、但至牧盤、則以現洋麥定價、依然便宜、無論行　、均隨時可定、是以買戶一寂、又重回軟、迨下午開現貨講買、目前雖無套出、而市塲之買戶、不免訂購者、似乎不注意於時令、此則深可憾耳、結果本月份祇好一分、八月份小一分、九月份小一分、十月份不動、十一月份好一分、現麥市面、微呈緊象、以市面已入底盤、似覺跌無可跌、故廠胃雖未見暢、價尚未見大落、開六合麥三元三角三分、湖熟麥三元三角二分、次三角、和州南京麥三元二角七分、揚州麥三元三角半、次三角、江新州麥三元三角五分、鎮江浦鎭麥三元三角、下蜀麥三元三角半、駐馬店麥三元三角半、賣應麥三元二角二分、福新去五千包、申大信大各去一千包云、</p>
<p>美麥據報告云、作物上之黑斑蔓延擴大、但確切之損失、則須視此後之天氣而定、現貨因未有套賣與到貨稀少、情形頗堅、</p>

<h3>麵粉常廉價洋麥所制</h3>
<p>昨日粉市、續見回振、因洋麥報價、芝加哥激漲一元二三四角左右、加拿大漲八分二角零不等、市塲人心、鑒於長江水災、依然嚴重、國外之報價、亦復回好、故買氣頗盛、開價即提二分左右、旋則內地廠家、對遠期頗有拋售、人心又復及往年、是以事實奧環境、常背道而馳也、迨下午開價、交易又清、市氣亦見疲滯、聞洋麥定價、仍然低宜、有袋之澳麥、衹四元四角六分左右、故市面方趨向榮、又受傾銷之打擊耳、結果七八月份漲一分、九十月份張一分半、十一月份張一分二厘半、十二月份漲一分云、</p>
<h3>各米去路俱見平淡</h3>
<p>本米昨且滬南來源仍到二十六七號、（貨共五千餘石）銷塲以天時已轉晴正、故更覺呆頓、城鄕店胃旣少辦、青島烟裏等帮亦祇辦二三百包、結果若各厚粳及薄稻等行情續見降下二角之碼、陰變元亦都隨落五分至一角、杜尖悉屬相仿、滬北昨日河下各路來船十六七艘、市上各貨去胃、因店方上市寥寥、白粳交易有限、價形短一角左右、早薄稻另消平淡、市價小一二角以白元零星仍淡、客性雖轉堅、而消胃淡弱、致價仍屬平疲之勢、其餘各貨、亦見軟勢、</p>
<p>洋米市况、昨日長江　　續有漢口辦裝、惟九江　時停手、惟目下長江各省災情甚重、農田被浸甚多、各地糧價均已微漲、因此市上人心大半看好、但昨日客化不旺、一部份正在裝運存米、一部份以該地水災過重、沿途不能轉運、所以去化反少、本街內地應酬不多、而南京與寧波兩幫又見活躍、市面隨轉居平稱之局、全日開出西貢六千包、小絞暹邏各米一千冬包、行情均與前市相似云、</p>
<h3>豆餅現貨仍見俏俐</h3>
<p>昨日豆餅市况、以天氣放晴、連電續升、又値明起溫州輪結關、致一般現餅、頗為緊張、又升四五分、期交餅及各種客餅亦被帶起、統市計開四牌現餅七八千片、又期交餅成交七千餘片牌餅一千餘片、各種客餅一萬餘片、劉下大溫台帮汕頭帮軋現俏風、或可避過、後情如無意外風波、其勢恐須盤旋、</p>
<h3>南北貨　徐魁子地價漲一元</h3>
<p>徐魁子近以產區有歉收象、地價逐步轉緊、昨據徐州函訊、前後巳漲起一元、劃申成本巳在十冗外、但申市走塲仍呆、暫時未能跟漲、較高者僅售九元二三角、相距尚遠、如去胃轉旺、當有隨緊之可能、</p>
<h3>雜訉上海人喫外國水果　一年化二百五十八萬元</h3>
<p>年來上海各食物水果店家所售外國水果、觸日皆是、去年一年、上海一埠進口的外國水果有如下列、</p>

<p>蘋果來自朝鮮美國為多、葡萄乾橘子首推美國、未列名果、以來自事灣美國日本菲島為多、合國弊二百五十八萬四千七百九十八元七角五分八　、在上海人看去、或許尚以為渺乎其小也、</p>

<h3>鈔書</h3>
<p>— 陳子展</p>
<p>中國有刻本書，大約起於隋唐時代，今日可以找得到的最古刻本，還沒有早過唐朝的。唐武宗會昌到懿宗咸通（西元八五〇年左右）之間，雕版印書的風氣已經盛行，當時印書的地方，有東都江有江東益州等處，遠而至於敦煌，可見印書已經是一件通常的事了。從晚唐到五代，刻書的人更多。後唐長興三年（西元九三二），國子監依石經文字刻九經，這就是監本的開端。因為大宗書籍，不是官力做不到，後來國子監廣刻諸書，就時　個緣故。在後唐刻經書以前，有母　裔在蜀刻文選學記等書，似乎蜀中刻工特多於別處。近年西湖雷峯塔倒掉，塔裏藏有吳越刻經，可見當時浙中也曾刻書，或者刻書的秘類還不止信個數日。有些歷史家說是刻書從五代馮道一人起頭，那是不很確常的話。</p>
<p>還有我們應該知道的，在有刻本書以前，早就有了刻字的事，不過沒有印成書本，或榻成墨本。有人說，文字創造之初，呌做書契，寫的呌做書，刻的呌做契。據今日可以找到的的最古的文字遺物推測，刻字早於寫字，也說不定。鄒漢勳洪　碑釋文，倘若可以相信的話，那麼西元前一千多年以前，中國就有了石刻。近代發見的龜甲骨，都是殷商的契刻文字。契刻的精美，今人還不易及，可見甲骨文是較為進步的刻字，不是出自初民之手。他如商彝周鼎秦權漢印的全文，西漢南越王胡墓中的本牘，後漢三國寫定諸經的石刻，瓦當磚甓之類的匋文，都屬於鐫刻文字，實為刻書之濫觴。不過眞有刻本書可讀的時代要從陪唐說起罷了。</p>
<p>隋唐五季時代雖然漸漸有了刻本書，還不是各種書都有刻本，也不是刻本書處處有賣，鈔本書還是很盛行的。三十多年前，敦煌石室發見了六朝陪唐人的寫本。如今所見古人的鈔本書，就要算六朝隋唐人所寫卷子本為最古了。因為書籍沒有刻本，鈔書就成了那時一般士人必需的工作。難怪六朝士大夫的歡喜鈔書，成為一種風氣。固然那時書籍的流通靠鈔寫，同時崇尚數典掉文的駢語，也靠鈔寫帮助記誦。現在我把南北史裏關於鈔書的故事，錄出一點來。我們有刻本書讀的人，也看看只有鈔本書讀的時代，一般要讀書的人是怎樣的辛勤艱苦。南史（卷二十二）王筠傳載著王筠的自序道：</p>
<p>余少好抄書，老而彌篤。雖遇見瞥觀，皆即疏記，後重省覽，懽興彌深，習與性成，不覺筆倦。自年十三四，建武二年乙亥至梁大同六年，四十載矣。幼年讀五經，皆七八十遍。愛左氏春秋，吟諷常為口實。廣略去取凡三週五抄。餘經及周官，儀禮，國語，雨雅，山海經，本草，並一冉抄。子史諸集皆一遍。未嘗倩人假手，並躬自抄錄，大小百餘卷。不足傳之好事，蓋以備遺忘而己。</p>
<p>王筠一生事業就在鈔書。他說出鈔書的緣故，一在興趣，因為「後重省覽，懽與彌深。」一在記誦，因為「以備遺忘」。他的姪兒王泰也歡喜鈔書，少時好學，手所鈔寫，二千多卷。南史（卷四十一）齊宗室衡塲元王道度繼子鈞傳裹說：</p>
<p>鈞常手自細書，寫五經，部為一卷，置於巾箱中，以備貴忘。侍讀賀玠問曰，殿下家自有墳素，復何須蠅頭細書，別藏巾箱中？答曰，中箱中有五經，於檢閱旣易，且一更手寫，則永不忘。諸王聞而爭効為巾箱五經，巾箱五經，自此始也。</p>
<p>在板本學上稱小本書為巾箱本，就是因齊衡陽王鈞我巾箱五經，纔我這一種書名。這一種書的好處在本子小，便於携帶，隨時可以翻閱，「以備遺忘」。自宋以來，士子赴試他們携帶的「考試必讀」一類之書，都是巾箱刻本。據未人戴埴的「　璞」一書裏說：</p>
<p>今巾箱刻本無所不備。嘉定間從學官楊璘之奏，禁小板。近又盛行，第挾書，非備巾箱之藏也。</p>
<p>原來科舉時代，士子赴試，需要夾帶，所以中箱本就特別流行起來了。又因為這種書可以藏在衣袖裏面，所以又呌做袖珍本。南史（卷五十六）張緬傳裏說：</p>
<p>緬抄後漢，晋書，抄三十卷。又抄江左集未及成。</p>
<p>又張纘傳一畏說；</p>
<p>晚頗積聚，多寫圖書，數萬卷。</p>
<p>可見張氏兄弟也是用功鈔書的人。南史（卷七十二）文學，袁峻傳裏說：</p>
<p>早孤，篤志好學，家貧無書，每從人假借，必皆抄寫，自課日五十紙，紙數不登，則不止。</p>
<p>這位袁先生因為家貧沒有書，只好向人家借書，借書未便不還，只好抄寫一過，每日限寫五十紙。唉！志士多苦心，虧他這麼用功了。</p>
<p>以上所說鈔書的故事，都屬於南朝方面。同時北朝方而，士大土同樣歡喜鈔書。北史（卷二十）穆崇傳裏說：</p>
<p>（穆）子容，少好學，無所不覽，求天下書，</p>
<p>逢即寫錄，所得萬餘卷。</p>
<p>同書（卷二十四）崔儦傳裏說：</p>
<p>（崔愍，字）長謙，少興太原王延業俱為著作佐郎，監典校書。後為靑州司馬，賊國城二百日，長謙讀書不廢，凡手抄八千餘紙。</p>
<p>又同書（卷三十八）裴漢傳裏說：</p>
<p>借人異書，必躬自錄本。至於疾疹彌年，亦未嘗釋卷。</p>
<p>又同書（卷六十四）章負傳裏說：</p>
<p>少愛文史，留情著述。手自抄錄數十萬言。</p>
<p>上文所舉幾個人，有的在病裏還要鈔書，有的在圍城裏不廢鈔書，似乎把鈔書比生命還看得要緊，這不能不說是南北朝士大夫間特有的風氣。這一風氣的麥成，當然像我在這篇文章開端說過的：「那時書籍的流通靠鈔寫，同時崇尚數典掉文的駢語，也靠鈔寫帮助記誦。」何况在那一時代的社會裏，一般士大夫過著悠間自在的生活，寫字鈔書正是一種高雅的消遺呢！</p>
<p>宋元時代，刻本書盛行，鈔本書漸慚减少。明淸兩代官修大部頭的書，如永樂大典，四庫全書，都是鈔本，沒有刻本。至今藏書家還有把精鈔本和宋元刻本同樣珍視的，可見鈔本書也還有牠存在的理由。至於今人著述，十之八九由自己鈔寫，自然，雇書記，用打字機的著作家，目前並不是絕對沒有。然而已有刻本的書，除非是撮要摘鈔，就絕少有人抄寫的了。</p>
<h3>幽夢</h3>
<p>— 段位岱</p>
<p>天還未明。</p>
<p>風，吹得紙窗，嘩啦嘩啦的通夜響。</p>
<p>枕頭是硬的，川了幾珊布面書堆砌成的。</p>
<p>因了貧窮，使我更心細，更焦灼，更想到了些不能不憤恨的事情。我用拳狠狠的擊着牀，拋開了手中的書，勉强盒上了大半夜睜着的倦眼。</p>
<p>電燈還是慘黃的燃着。</p>
<p>在我的心內，往覆的，想怪從弟不該來告訴我這件不愉快的事情。</p>
<p>然而，曙鷄在啼，像警告着與演感傷任務的人，明天的慘酷的現實，還正裝着鬼臉等待着你哩！</p>
<p>我在朦朧中走入了一條小街。</p>
<p>這街是污穢的，狹窄的，陰黯的，完全是故鄉的小鎮的色調。</p>
<p>少年人，公潤，走近我的面前了。</p>
<p>「你，那裏去，明晴？」一停隻有毛的手，冰冷，突然的，緊抓住了我的膀子。</p>
<p>我驟然而對着這個矮瘦精悍的人，說不出半句話，只是暗暗的設想着：</p>
<p>——他不是已經死了的人，鬼嗎？</p>
<p>然而，我終於不好意思說出來，直瞧着他的滿頰未修的短鬍髭，和一件油膩膩的淺灰色綫嗶嘰的獵服。</p>
<p>「到我那兒去！」他的眼珠，發着藍熖，眈眈的望着我的臉。</p>
<p>於是，我的兩條腿，不由自主的，跟着他，走到一個這樣的地方——一扇大破板門，四面烏黑的高牆，幾隻衰老的狗，室中冷淸淸的，別無任何好看擺設，可以噢着潮濕的菌氣，比這人平日的住處差不了許多，我暗暗的打量着。</p>
<p>他在陰暗處向我發出了話：</p>
<p>「你看，我竟遭了這樣的結果，……哎！」話聲中含着無限懊悔意：「我眞的被他們這樣解决了！但是，唉，可惜！前年拿到那麼多的人，跟着我，沒吃的，想幹，我都不讓他們亂來，為了我們都是好人家的子弟，怎麼能去搶人，當土匪，擾書自己壩方上做莊稼的人呦！」</p>
<p>「是的。」</p>
<p>我簡直不知道用什麼動聽的話去應設。</p>
<p>「你思，事情過了兩年，他們命　　這樣的帽子來套我，匪　　唉，它媽的，給他們花錢去買命，哪來的那麼多硬頭貨啦！……唉！」</p>
<p>他搓着手，指頭　　的響，條手槍彈。</p>
<p>我知道他心底正燃着憤恨的火花，我依舊是很笨的直啾着他的嘴叭，說不出一句安慰這被歷史糟蹋了的人的得体話。</p>
<p>「唉！」我照樣的咬緊牙齒哼着氣。</p>
<p>一管很銹的獵槍，緊握在他的瘦拳內，被我突然的發見着。</p>
<p>我知道他是正懷着一種無可如何的哀情，像項羽烏江解劍時那樣責難着自己，為什麼不早點下手去消滅他的那幾個對頭喲！</p>
<p>報仇——這兩個字，像佔有了這時他的全部的心窩。</p>
<p>我很內咎的，拘束不安的，瞧着那一枝古式的生了銹的獵槍。</p>
<p>狗搖着尾巴使我們完全陷於沉思中了。</p>
<p>「咿呀！」——我的臥室門響。</p>
<p>從弟拖着鞋聲、坐在我的椅子上，冷然的望着我的帳子。</p>
<p>我只好又醒過來，瞧着這條被飢寒蹉磨的活身姿。</p>
<p>然而，故鄕的慘逝的年靑人的影子，還是很顯明的映在我的心上。</p>
<p>為了生存的理由，我不能呆呆的紀念着這些跌下陷阱的好人，我只能睜起眼睛走我自己今天應走的路。</p>

<p>早上剛剛醒來的時候，便聞着陸地上那種樹葉和泥草混合的氣味，趕緊爬起來看，原是我們的船已經駛進海港了，兩岸睡在晨光下面的熱帶林子，都浸上了淡綠微黃的潮水，彷彿就是長在水中一樣，林中的樹木些，並不高大，全是矮矮的，但却茂密得很，看來像獵狗之類也不容易鑽進去似的，——景緻全現得新鮮而荒野，而且，港中不曾點綴有指示航路的標記，小船也沒有來往的，幾乎使人疑心船是航到一處無人　住的大　了。</p>
<p>緬甸女人坐在船板上梳着頭，一面用手推推還在入睡的中國老頭子，問是到了甚麼地方。</p>
<p>老頭子用手肘半支起了身子，一面揉着模糊不淸的眼睛向岸上望去，一面混用着廈門話和緬甸話喃喃自語道：</p>
<p>「咕叻坡……莫褐補……莫褐補……」（星加坡……不是……不是）</p>
<p>一個廣東水手正在收拾吊在船尾上計算海里的長素子，一面使着台山人的口音回答着什麼人的問話。</p>
<p>「……是昨天打來的電哪……不是就該到星加坡囉，丟亢媽個害！……</p>
<p>這時麻面小夥子盒着濕漉漉的面巾，從甲板上走了上來，對着老頭子眏了一下怪樣的眼色，做出恐嚇的神情說：</p>
<p>「糟了！老頭子，糟了！」</p>
<p>老頭子本要打聽關於什麼電的消息的，給麻面小夥子這麼突如其來的一嚇，便詫異地問道：</p>
<p>「甚米事？」</p>
<p>「甚米事？？……自家的事自家心裏明白。」</p>
<p>麻面小夥子做出搗鬼似的樣子，歪了一下嘴巴。隨即很敏捷地轉過身去，將面巾揪了一把，然後張開，放在一捲包袱上面，鼻裏哼着快意的聲昔。</p>
<p>老頭子一面坐起來扣衣鈕，一面就惡意地回答道：</p>
<p>「有我嗎？……，那也跑不掉你！」</p>
<p>麻面小夥子風快地轉過身來，將兩隻手揑緊，舉在胸膛上搖晃着，發出鋼鐵一般的聲音，說道：</p>
<p>「我嗎？…兩個拳頭一隻嘴巴！……怕甚米？」</p>
<p>中年胖商人敞着未扣鈕子的白短衣，挺着肥厚的胸膛走了上來，看見麻面小夥子這麼怪神氣地，就皺一皺額頭皮，跟着像得意自己先知道了那麼似的，高聲說道：</p>
<p>「各位，你們知道嗎？船為什麼向這裏開？」</p>
<p>對着大家的面孔，滿意地望了一通之後，把背靠在船攔邊上，才接說下去。</p>
<p>「昨見頭二等艙那面的朋友說，船開到這邊來，是為了犯人的事情，昨天馬來聯邦政府還特特打電報給檳城的政府哩！」</p>
<p>他說到犯人兩字的時候，眼光便向老頭子和麻面小夥子掃視了一下，說完了，又特對老頭子尖聲問道：</p>
<p>「老頭子，我問你玀，你在吉隆坡犯過案嗎？」</p>
<p>老頭子的瘦臉上，微微紅漲起來，慍然地反問道：</p>
<p>「怪了！我犯過什麼案？」</p>
<p>麻面小夥子將嘴巴朝老頭子一遞，眯細着眼睛，嘲弄道：</p>
<p>「你扯謊！你沒犯過麼？…哼，我還親眼看見哩！」</p>
<p>老頭子大發火了，將巴掌往身邊一拍，駡道：</p>
<p>「滾你媽的蛋，你親眼看見過甚米？」</p>
<p>麻面小夥子一味嘻皮笑臉地。</p>
<p>「嚇，嚇，你不要賴！……我親眼看見的，你在吉隆坡街上，一足踏斷了紅毛鬼的尾巴！」</p>
<p>衆人笑起來了。（未完）</p>
<h3>一顆心</h3>
<p>— 呂紹光</p>
<p>一串串的日子，</p>
<p>忽忽的，在幻夢的邊緣滑過了，——杏無聲息地。</p>
<p>年青的心，刺上了</p>
<p>生活的烙印；</p>
<p>抑鬱的影子，</p>
<p>像雨天的苦悶的黃昏！</p>
<p>「春去了，夏又來臨！」</p>
<p>悽迷的太息，</p>
<p>上衰頽的眉峰，</p>
<p>如今，我深深的認識了人生！</p>
<p>不是虛渺的說謊，</p>
<p>或輕薄的荒唐，</p>
<p>一顆心，老是顫慄着，</p>
<p>像是為了什麼？</p>
<p>呵，為了什麼呢！</p>
<h3>大學時代（二一）</h3>
<p>— 德國施托謨著陳隱之譯</p>
<p>手風琴底糢糊聲音和年市塲底喧嘩嘈鬧從園外響到我們耳邊來。</p>
<p>在我們前面，從蔭道盡頭看出去，在不可到達的遠處，還有一小塊金色晚霞未曾消滅。我把她的手夾在臂膀裏，又再握着。</p>
<p>恰在此時忽然有個東西在我們面前路上跑過去，這也許是一隻刺猬出來捕鼠的。——她稍微吃了一驚，緊靠到我身邊來；我聲乎是無意地便把臂膀圍繞她的腰；我覺得她的小頭滑落、在我的肩頭上。</p>
<p>接着，很快地，僅有一秒鐘，兩僩人底嘴唇接觸了一下，——我們便像痴子一樣從蔭蔽的樹影裏走到空地上來。</p>
<p>我們便是這樣走着，我還握着她的手，不久便走到路底盡頭，穿過一個園門，走上一條鄉野的小路；這小路從側面通到本城底最末了的幾閒屋子。</p>
<p>我們並步很匆遽地走着，彷彿巴不得這次會面快點終結了似的。</p>
<p>「我的父親會去尋找我的；時候的確太要了！」娜麗說，頭沒有抬起來。</p>
<p>『我也是這樣想！』我回答。我們走得比前更快。</p>
<p>我們巳經站在小路盡頭，對着街上最末了幾家屋子了。菩提樹下裁逢屋子窗戶中射出的燈光，照見離我不遠地方有個小姑娘在井旁站着，我當然不能向前走了。但當娜麗踏上街上石路時候，我突然想起，我不當讓她這樣離開我。</p>
<p>『娜麗，』我迷惘地說，『我還有話對你說。』</p>
<p>她退回來一步。『甚麼？』她問。</p>
<p>『再等一會吧！』</p>
<p>她轉回身來，安靜地站在我面前。我聽見，她怎樣用手抹着頭髮，怎樣束緊頭上那塊紅布；但我好久都沒有辦法把混亂的思潮淸理起來，思潮像迷茫的烟霧那樣在我眼前晃蕩着。『娜麗，』最後我說，『你現在還怨恨我麼？』</p>
<p>她眼睛垂向地下，搖搖頭。</p>
<p>『你明天再到這裏來，好麼？』</p>
<p>她遲疑了一會。『我平常晚間是不出門的，』她後來說。</p>
<p>『娜麗，你說謊：不是這一回事；你把實話告訴我吧！』</p>
<p>我去抓她的手，但她抽回去了。</p>
<p>『說話啊，娜麗！—你不肯說麼？』</p>
<p>她還默默地在我面前站了一會兒，然後把頭抬起來，看着我。『我是知道的，』她低聲說，『你是衹會同那些漂繳小姐結婚的。』</p>
<p>我一句話不能回答。這句實言是我所料惹不到的；我從來未曾想過這樣大的事情，更不知道如何回答這種問題了。</p>

<h3>全國監獄有人滿之患</h3>
<p>— 行安</p>
<p>因經濟不景氣的日趨尖銳化，社會上犯罪案件的激增，實是一個應有的現象。近經司法行政部監獄司的調查，二十三年終在監人犯，與前一年年終比較，江蘇省增加百分之三四，浙江省增加百分之八·五，山西省增加百分之二六·八，安徽省增加百分之三二·四。按照以上四省增加的囚額平均計算，在一年以內，已增加百分之二十。其餘各省，可以類推。循這趨勢，全國囚徒之　，四五年後，勢必倍增。這是很值得注意的。又就新監收容的定額考核，聞其超過規定之數，亦已在一倍以上，大有人滿之患。這更是值得顧慮。</p>
<p>司法當局有鑒於此，深以容額有限的監獄，收禁激增不已的人犯，管理給養，旣感困難，感化政策，亦無從貫澈。且以罪犯人數過多，互相接觸，最易感受惡習，而囚徒羣居雜處，亦易發生疫癘。故為救濟之計，現值暑期已屆，將依法執行减刑辦法，以疏通在監的人犯。聞减刑辦法所規定者，為判决確定受有期徒刑的執行，已逾三分之一，而行狀改善而有技的，才算合格。</p>
<p>我國各地監獄的設備，本極簡陋而不周備舊式監獄的黑暗情狀，早為有目所共覩。卽少數新式監獄，亦難免尚有不少缺點。這給與一班因罪入獄之囚犯的痛苦，已是非常之深。而現時更因全國犯罪人數的激增，遂使各地監獄，不得不收容超過定額至一倍以上的犯人，致發生上述種種的不便和弊害。則囚徒所感受的苦楚，更不能形容。故我們對於司法當局之减刑辦法，誠為目前之急務。</p>
<p>惟减少罪犯，减刑而外，尚有緩刑與假釋二項。然這不過是一種治標的辦法。根本之策，須政治淸明，社會安定，經濟充實，敎育普及，犯罪事件，才能防北。故我們希望政府當局，除從消極方面，减少罪犯的人數。更應從積極方面，改良人民犯罪的環境。至若各地新舊式監獄的改善，監獄的增設，囚徒待遇的改良等，亦是不可忽視的。程銓</p>
<h3>蝗蟲</h3>
<p>— 程銓</p>
<p>鄉裏有人來，說起田裏頭的事情，搖搖頭，夾了夾眼睛，額上縐起了起幾道深而烏黑的條紋，說：「噯，照我說，種田人不知道造下了什麼孽，田裏的事情是一輩子都弄不好的了，去年荒了一年，倒也死挨地挨過去了。巴巴地指望今年罷！喝，今年！秧汛裏一乾，到現在又鬧了蝗蟲；看樣子，今年年成是已經又去了一大半，今年是又準完結了。」</p>
<p>說着，便沈到靜默中去——也許已經在馳想又將重復去年的上吊與投河的今年冬裏的悲劇了——這景象是可怕得太不適宜去擬想了，一想到它，人彷彿便掉進了冰窟裏一樣，周身淋了一陣透骨的冷氣，使人冽得甚至打顫。</p>
<p>而，彷彿徧又不肯放棄這可怕的想頭似的，停了一下，又在這話題上繼續說下去了——</p>
<p>「噯，眞眞是沒法兒的：天災哪！想起來呢，倒也不是沒來由的，去年冬上沒好好地下過一塲　　，又沒正正式式的冷過一天，這樣，田裏的蟲子凍不死，今年的蟲災怎樣會不多呢？噯，我說這時世是連天老爺都不對了：該冷的時候不冷；該熱的時候不熱；日子倒過來過了，也難怪世界上都攪得七顛八倒了。」</p>
<p>說起蝗蟲，那種可怕的景象到現在還能描摹得出，這實在是不容易忘掉的。</p>
<p>雖然說，已經是十來年以來的事情了，那時候年紀還小，跟大人住在鄉裏頭，每天跟塾裏的老先生唸五頁左傳，閑下來便帮着做點農家的小事情。那一年，也是初夏的光景啊，村子裏鬧起蝗災來了，把鮮嫩的稻頭吃個精光，鄉裏人就那麼挨了一年的「半飢不飽。」</p>
<p>起初是這樣的：還是剛過端陽沒幾天呢，近邊的人家在稻田裏發現了一隻土黃色的形狀像蚱蜢一樣的蟲兒，一下子就認出了：是蝗蟲啊！這一驚眞是非同小可的，便馬上嚷了出去，村上人全乾着急，沒有別的法子啊，就祇得依了老年人的話，到鎭上的土地廟裏去求蝗神，允了一台草台戲的願，大家還去叩了頭。</p>
<p>可是還不上三天，一個下午，天空裏起了一陣嘈雜的「吱吱」的聲音，人抬頭一望，可眞的是蝗蟲來了，無千無萬的聚了一大羣，像一堆烏雲般地在天空飛着，竟把日光都遮了一大片，在地上也看得見了：彷彿一塊黑影子在飄。村裏的人是驚得亂了手脚了：有的趕緊買了大砲杖來對天放，有的奔到蝗神而前去叩頭許願（他們相信：蝗蟲是有個神在管理的。）有的急得在家裏哭；可是，這些又有什麼烏用呢？不到一個月，田裏的稻頭就給吃去了七八分，稻桿子都發了黃倒下來了！而一村子的勞苦，希望，與一年中生活的泉源，也便一齊在這恐慌的，沒有辦法的情况中斷到了！</p>
<p>那一年冬天，鄉下人便衹得拿豆子與麥　來充饑了；一個新年是死沈沈地過去的，沒有人家做糕做糰子，也沒有草台戲與燈會來了。</p>
<p>這兇險而可怕的情景依舊留在記憶中，到現在已經是近二十來個年頭了。聽見說鄉裏今年又鬧蝗蟲，間鄉裏來的人，據說還依舊祇是到鎭上土地廟裏去叩頭許願而巳——除了這，還有什麼法子呢？說：「是天災啊！」</p>
<p>一想到這，我真不敢再想下去了。</p>

<h3>鄕村鎖事</h3>
<p>— 村因</p>
<p>輕盪着的淸夜的凉風，像太陽光似的，透過了一個寂寞的小村落。在那兒，村落里年輕的男人和女人，都明朗地坐在悒鬱的月光里。那些年紀蒼老的男人和女人，大半已經躺在暗灰的床上發出了酣睡的鼾聲。</p>
<p>我們所熱悉的，是阿升這一家世代的農人。他們說話的口音，完全是純粹的鄉下腔調。阿升的唯一的兒子，雖然曾在附近的小鎭上讀過半年書，可是那種有系統的口音，却還是原本地沒有一點改移。</p>
<p>這幾天，村落里的人們，無論在田野間或是屋簷下，一逢到空閑，便會談起阿升家的兒子來。</p>
<p>「還有三天，小阿升可以擁抱到一個小嬌娘啦。」</p>
<p>「小阿升這一代挺淸凈，只有他獨個兒。」</p>
<p>「是啊，所以這麼早就結婚了。」</p>
<p>我們所能聽到的，也不外乎關於小阿升的娶老婆的消息。而且，連小阿升自己，有時也會在田野里偷偷地跟他的好伙伴談上一二句關於娶老婆的雜話。</p>
<p>現在，在月亮下輕盪的是這初夏的凉風，在凉風里遠揚的，是小阿升的娶老婆的議論。</p>
<p>其中，要算那個像一頭山豬那麼强健的李生談得最有勁了。他睜大了那二顆圓腿珠，抹着鼻尖上的細汗，說：</p>
<p>「我猜小阿升將來一定做色癆鬼！」他帶着妬嫉的口吻，脫離不了那副山豬的樣兒。是的，假如你是李生，也許會更不中聽小阿升十七歲就要娶老婆的那回事了。因為李生現在是三十一歲，還沒有娶老婆，連做媒的人也沒有上過他家的門。他喜歡聽人家講關於女人的故事，尤其是注意到那些從城市里帶來的俏姑娘的圖片。</p>
<p>「要是我也到鎭上去唸他半年書，回家後，怕也能有人家來給我提親了。」</p>
<p>他說過這句話後，把坐在四週的那些人都逗笑了。他們都張開了嘴巴，在這黑夜里笑着一只可憐的蠢笨的山豬。</p>
<p>「十七歲要老婆準是會早死的！」在笑聲里，他又粗燥的裝着咒誓的樣子减着。</p>
<p>「你瘋了？李生。」坐在他旁邊的那個有一只眼珠失明的阿康忍住了笑，嚴正地訴問他。</p>
<p>「獨眼龍！跋你說了吧，這不是太笑話嗎？——我索來做事勤快，做人老實，連字兒都不高興去識半個，這樣一個老實人倒沒有老婆，那個油腔滑調的小傢伙倒此我先娶起老婆來了。」那麼一大堆的話，把李生又逗笑了。</p>
<p>「李生，別痴心管閑賬吧。你自己想一想看：阿升的家里比你有錢呵！」阿康打了個呵欠。</p>
<p>「是的，阿升家里不是認識黃地主的嗎？哦吓，對了，去年向我們强迫要交出黃地主的租米的，不正是他們嗎？」他恍然地笑了。</p>
<p>「阿升家是世代的老農戶呵，所以地主信任他們？旁邊另外一個人挿嘴進來。</p>
<p>「呸，他們是世代的會拍馬的人！所以地主會信任他們。」李生粗燥地說着，幾乎要把自己的腦袋炸裂開來。</p>
<p>「靜心一點去睡覺吧，他們是比我們有耐性，他們回去喝地主的洗脚水，所以他們到得一點方便。可是，他們也不是像我們一樣的一個人嗎？』阿康提着他自己坐的小竹椅，一邊說着，一邊走開了。</p>
<p>「可是他們有老婆！這，你怎麼說呢？」李生更其火惱了。月亮笑着他，阿康笑着他。</p>
<p>淸夜的凉風竭力地把李生的火惱吹散。</p>
<p>而，小阿升正打鎭上提着一大包東西回來。</p>
<p>「黃地主送給小阿升一大包綢緞呢。」</p>
<p>於是這一段羨慕的消息，不到天明，頓時傳佈了全個村落。</p>
<h3>鴛鴦湖小景</h3>
<p>— 施瑛</p>
<p>過去的記憶，像一個夢，像夢裏的湖水，一閃一晃地，不叫你抓住。眼前是鴛鴦湖，淡藍而平靜。在這水光雲影裏，她的年華，漸漸地消褪着，跟一片放足的花一樣。她太息着，望着那閃閃的湖波。</p>
<p>她是鴛鴦湖的船娘，每天每天，在那綠楊埠頭徘徊，在那湖波中泛着遊船來往。她不知道那些玩鴛鴦湖的遊客，究竟有什麼趣味。他們坐在狹小的船裏，手中燃着烟捲，悠悠地望着船外展開的波光。遠處是綠的岸，綠的郊原。湖中的烟雨樓，彷彿浸在水裏。綠楊蓬鬆，像仙女的雲鬢，掩映着紅牆翠柳，小橋流水，寂寞的水埠，砌着古老的石階顯得異樣的整齊。她輕聲問遊客，可要到烟雨樓去玩嗎？遊客似是似否地點了下頭，他們的眼光，却望站在船頭撑篙的她，她那輕麗的身段。船終於停在烟雨樓畔，她讓他們上了洲岸，自己站在水邊等着他們。遊客悠閒地坐在樓上，也許喝一兩點鐘茶，她望着湖面，湖面翠綠的菱蕩，採南湖菱的孩子，怔上一兩個鐘點。</p>
<p>過去她也是孩子，莊稼人家無邪的小姑娘，為了父母的飢寒，便給賣與鴛鴦湖遊船的主婦。鴛鴦湖裏，有幾十個這樣的女孩。小時候，她還不能出賣她的笑容，便隨了伙伴們，站在火熱的宣公橘畔。六月的天氣，太陽晒得她們發暈，汗水濕了她們的單衣，她們一壁揮着蒲扇，一壁以可憐疲勞的眼光，找尋遊客。她辛苦地看見一個漢子，便趕上去跟在後面：「要擺渡嗎？要玩南湖嗎」？那個人不聞不見地儘向走。她跟在後面：「阿要擺渡嗎」？絮叨着，喘着氣跟着，太陽炙出她瘦臉上的汗，路上的乾灰塵，揚起來粘上她的臉上，她的小手擦着臉，還絮叨喘氣在跟。直到完全絕望，她才嘴裏咕嚕着退回來。在風雨的侵蝕裏，在疲勞的水上生活裏，在「阿要擺渡」的聲音裏，她的童年消逝了，她長成了如花的少女：學會了粗糙的笑語，細膩的招呼。用她的笑，招引着遊客，點綴在平寗的湖上，打發着糢糊的日子過去。</p>
<p>一年的功失，祇有夏末秋初，是她最忙的時候。她站在船頭上，抽着下劣的紙烟，望着碧綠的菱蕩。南湖菱正上市，烟雨樓頭，頻添了不少的生氣。她載着客人，在那熟悉的湖水中來往。一切是美麗的。有時是月夜，鴛鴦湖籠在輕薄的夢裏，湖面飄着新放桂子的芳香。她應和遊客的調笑，高興地叙述湖上的故事，她的聲音像銀鈴。——在遊客的心醉裏，她得了明天的口糧。</p>
<p>可是秋天快完了，鴛鴦湖上的遊客，便稀少起來。像飄落着黃葉的樹枝，鴛鴦湖也一天冷落一天。她坐在船頭，望着空朗而平靜的鴛鴦湖面南湖菱已過去了，湖面祇留着一些採殘的葉片，一朵一朶地，隨着波痕，東西漂流。將來自然况在水底。她懷想到往事，望着蕭條的四野，望着捲盪在湖波裏的菱葉，不覺輕輕地心上漾出感傷，獨自低聲說：「採殘的菱片，東西漂蕩，這是永遠的未來嗎？……</p>

<h3>銀錢往來應有證據</h3>
<p>編者先生：</p>
<p>在四年前我有一位朋友開設了一　洋貨店，我把自己所有的積蓄一千元全投資在這店內，但數目太小了，所以附在經理（就是我的朋友）名下，作為半股。當時因為我和經理是很好的朋友，並沒有取得股票；同時他還允我這店裏供職，所以我自己以為是有恃無恐的。不料在最近因我和經理意見衝突，發生口角，他便撤去我的職務。而我為了一家人的生活關係，想把那一千元的股本提出，另謀別的生路。誰知他竟說我當時沒有股票，竭力否認我是股東，於是大家鬧得很僵，我現在想向法院起訴，但沒有股票，不知前途有把握否？還有別的方法取回這筆欵子嗎？務懇先生替我想一方法，否則一家人生活就沒有着落了！致請</p>
<p>撰安　　郭泰源敬上</p>
<p>編者按：郭君把自己所有積蓄投資於人，當時並不取得證據，未免是太大意了，信人太過了。雖然他是你的「很好的朋友」，雖然他允你在他店內供職，但在手續上總不能這樣的疏忽。現在的法律注重蹬據，這件事實在有點困難。不過法律上所提出的證據並不限於簽花著押的契約，別的東西如有充分的理由，也可以作為有力的證據。假使郭君在付欵時，得有經理的收條，回單，或該號資本賬內有這筆欵子的記載，或以往他的信內有承認這股欵的語句，還有，在過去他曾否付紅利給你？如付給時有承認股份的物瞪，都可以憑之而追訴。沒有物蹬，人證也可以，譬如付欵時有沒有別人在塲證明。不過人證都沒有物證有力吧了。我們想一千元的數目也不可說少，决不會一點瞪據都沒有的吧。假使郭君有了充分的瞪據，那末法律起訴是有勝利的希望的。</p>

<h3>Flood Breaches Dike: Yanshi County Town Submerged; Luo and Yi Rivers Overflow, Causing Disaster; All Residents of the City Adrift; County Magistrate Clings to Wood, Floats to Safety</h3>
<p>(Xuzhou) Road News: The Luo River, due to a mountain flood, overflowed its banks and flowed horizontally. On the 8th, it poured into Yanshi County, drowning over a thousand people. Yanshi County Town is located two li south of the Longhai Railway, in a very low-lying area, with a protective dike for flood prevention. This time, the water was too fierce, breaching the dike and flowing over it. On the evening of the 8th, when the water was at its highest, it was level with the city. As the Longhai train passed, all that could be seen was a vast expanse of water, with only the treetops visible. There were many floating objects. By the evening of the 9th, the water had receded, but Yanshi City was still submerged. The losses were very heavy. It is generally believed that relocating the administration is necessary to avoid flooding. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Road News: Mountain floods erupted in western Henan, and the Luo and Yi Rivers overflowed. Yanshi County is located below Mount Song, in a very low-lying area. On the morning of the 8th, the water level suddenly rose, immediately surrounding Yanshi City. Officials and civilians rushed to repair the protective dike, but the situation was urgent. That night, the flood breached the dike, and the county town was submerged. Thousands of residents in the city were caught off guard in the dark and were swallowed by the waters. The number of deaths cannot be determined. Only the county magistrate clung to wood and floated to safety. A few hundred other people also escaped to the mountains, their cries of mourning and pleas for help shaking the mountains. It was a terrible sight. On the morning of the 9th, the water level dropped, flowing from Xiaoyi and Gong County into the main channel of the Yellow River, causing the water level on the plains to drop by six feet. However, when the Longhai train passed Yanshi on the 9th, it saw the county town still submerged, with only the city gate tower, telegraph poles, and buildings inside the city faintly visible above the water. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) On the Longhai Railway, between Yijingpu to the east and Heishiguan, mountain floods erupted on the evening of the 8th, causing the Yi and Luo Rivers to rise. The Yellow River also flowed backward due to flooding. As a result, between the 80th and 88th marker posts, the floodwaters submerged the tracks. It was extremely dangerous for trains to pass. On the first night, the water level on the plains suddenly dropped by six feet, exposing the tracks. The railway bureau sent personnel from Zhengxi to inspect the roadbed and bridges. Fortunately, they were not washed away. On the morning of the 10th, express and slow trains to Tongguan resumed normal service. The Xuzhou station has started selling tickets to Tongguan. However, several sections of the Baqiao bridge and the newly built roadbed on the Tongxi section have been washed away. As the water has not receded, it is temporarily difficult to repair them. Traffic can be restored in a few days. The number of travelers going northwest from Beijing and Xuzhou has decreased in recent days. (10th Central News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) Road News: In the Songshan area of the western section of the Longhai Railway, mountain floods erupted on the 8th. The Luo River overflowed its banks and flowed north across the Longhai Railway. Between the 80th and 84th marker posts east of Yanshi, for a length of about six li, the water submerged the tracks by one foot. Near the Yanshi section, the water level was even with the tracks. The roadbed, being old and firmly built, was not damaged. On the 8th and 9th, passenger trains were guided by track inspection vehicles, slowly wading through the water. Traffic east of Tongguan has not been stopped. Therefore, the Xuzhou station still sells tickets to Tongguan daily. On the evening of the 9th, the water level at Yanshi station dropped by six feet. The overflowing water from the Luo River flowed through Gong County and into the Yellow River. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Xuzhou) With continuous heavy rain in Henan and Shaanxi, mountain floods erupted in western Henan. Both the Luo and Yi Rivers overflowed and flowed eastward. Yanshi County was surrounded by floodwaters, which poured in from the south gate, making the situation precarious. On the evening of the 8th, the water submerged the Longhai road surface to a depth of one meter. The area between Yijingpu station, passing through Yanshi to Heishiguan, was inundated. The Yellow River's main channel flowed eastward from Tongguan. The Longhai express train passed through this section on the evening of the 8th, reducing speed and being guarded by trains both in front and behind, but the danger was still very great. It arrived in Xuzhou several hours late. The Railway Bureau telegraphed on the 9th that express trains from Xuzhou westward could only reach Zhengzhou. It was also reported that the tracks between the Luo River bridge and Yijing station were not washed away. Once the water level drops, traffic can be restored. Furthermore, the rise of the Luo and Yi Rivers caused a surge in the Yellow River's water level. Fortunately, the dikes downstream were strongly repaired and maintained, so there was no major danger.

<h3>Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters Expands Disaster Relief Scope; Decides to Establish a General Disaster Relief Association; Also Dispatches Aircraft to Distribute Notices; Orders Local Officials to Pay Attention to Rescue; Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek Issues Guidelines for Flood Relief in Various Provinces</h3>
<p>(Hankou) After Zhang Xueliang inspected the flood along the Yangtze River from Shashi and returned to Wuhan, he considered the disaster situation to be severe and the disaster area to encompass more than one province. He immediately launched a relief campaign to expand the scope of disaster relief. The previously determined plan has been changed, and the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters will establish a General Disaster Relief Association to coordinate the overall situation. Each disaster-stricken province will have a Provincial Disaster Relief Association organized by the provincial government to take charge of the operation. The Hubei Relief Association is already in preparation. On the 10th, the Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters dispatched aircraft to distribute notices in the Jiangling, Shashi, Huangfu, Echeng, Hanchuan, Mianyang, Tianmen, and Qianjiang areas, ordering local officials to supervise the people to carry out rescue efforts. The troops should automatically assist and maintain order, and no delays are allowed.

The Wutai and Wannian sluice gates are leaking very rapidly. There are many victims, who are being accommodated in Hongshan, Heshan, and Fengfeng Mountain. The victims are divided into three categories: 1. Those who cannot support themselves and have no home. 2. Those whose houses are flooded but can build a board shelter for themselves. 3. Those who can support themselves and have a home to move to. Relief is provided differently according to these categories. The Wangjiadou Dike in Qianjiang upstream and the Linjiaji Dike in Jingmen have breached, and the disaster area is very extensive. The provincial government has allocated 5,000 yuan for emergency relief to Jingsha. (10th Special Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Hankou) In recent days, the Yangtze River water level is still rising, and the disaster situation is all around. Commander-in-Chief Chiang Kai-shek is deeply concerned and has telegraphed to various provinces, issuing nine major guidelines for flood relief, ordering them to be handled separately within a specified time. The original telegram is as follows: (Abridged title) The policy of disaster relief depends on early preparation in peacetime and careful planning of remedies in emergencies. In light of the frequent disasters in recent years, this Commander-in-Chief has repeatedly ordered various provinces to plan for drought prevention in advance, hoping to prepare for the coming rain. Since the beginning of summer, continuous rain has caused the Yangtze River to rise sharply. In recent days, the water level has risen even higher, and other rivers have also risen. The disaster situation is all around and is deeply concerning. For areas with lighter damage, they should immediately prevent dike breaches and actively protect them without any negligence. For areas with heavier flooding, they should immediately collect laborers and find ways to carry out rescue efforts, so as to reduce the disaster and narrow its scope. If the flooding is particularly severe and the disaster has already occurred, they should prepare relief in accordance with relevant laws and regulations. The organization of institutions, the raising of relief funds, and the procedures for implementation must be properly determined within a specified time to meet the emergency and avoid panic in the face of the situation. The following are the major guidelines for flood relief in various provinces: (1) Each province shall establish a provincial flood relief association within five days of receiving the telegram, and all existing relief agencies and groups shall be merged under unified control for operation. (2) The general association shall be convened by the provincial government and organized by the provincial party and government military agencies and related groups or individuals. It shall be established on one side and reported to this Commander-in-Chief's Headquarters for record on the other. (3) There is no fixed number of members in the general association. There are five to nine standing committee members, one of whom is the chairman and is authorized to handle daily affairs. (4) The matters handled by the general association shall be divided into: 1. General Affairs Group, handling documents, intelligence, statistics, internal accounting, general affairs, and other matters not belonging to other groups. 2. Fundraising Group, handling fundraising and public relations. 3. Accounting Group, handling the receipt and disbursement of donations. 4. Procurement Group, handling the procurement and storage of materials needed for relief. 5. Relief Group, handling the receipt and distribution of relief goods. 6. Shelter Group, handling the shelter and placement of victims. 7. Health Group, handling the treatment of victims and environmental sanitation. 8. The detailed organization of the general association shall be determined according to the complexity of the affairs and the relationship between people and land, in accordance with the above points. (5) Each province may establish branches in various cities and counties depending on the flood situation. The organization and working methods shall be stipulated and guided by the provincial general association. (6) Relief funds and goods shall be raised by the general association and branches from relief agencies, charitable organizations, and individuals inside and outside the province. At the same time, the provincial government should allocate funds for relief. (7) Relief funds and goods shall be under the unified control of the general association. Those raised by the branches shall be controlled by the branches but still reported to the general association for record. (8) The raising and distribution of relief funds and goods by the general and branch associations in all provinces shall be strictly supervised and verified by the respective provincial governments to ensure that the benefits reach the people and that the funds are not wasted. (9) Every effort should be made to shelter and settle the victims in each province and not to send them out of the country. Order them to handle it separately and report it at any time.

<h3>Manchuria Conference and Japan-Soviet Relations</h3>
<p>— Appropriate</p>
<p>Japan-Soviet relations have repeatedly become strained since the September 18th Incident. However, the Soviet Union has consistently maintained its peaceful diplomatic policy, making every effort to compromise in order to avoid war. As a result, the two countries have been able to maintain normal diplomatic relations until now. Recently, the Soviet ambassador to Japan, Yurenev, also discussed with Japanese Foreign Minister Hirota the establishment of a joint committee of Japan, the Soviet Union, and Manchukuo to resolve all border disputes, suggesting that relations between the two countries are improving. However, according to yesterday's Tokyo dispatch, the 12th "Manchukuo"-"Mongolia" conference was held in Manchuria on the 6th. Disputes arose between the two sides over the arrest of a Japanese surveyor, Inukai, in Mongolian territory, and the ownership of the Halha Temple also became an issue. The Manchuria conference, originally scheduled to continue on the 9th, was postponed. The Japanese side even claimed that if the Outer Mongolian side did not change its attitude, it would not hesitate to withdraw the Manchukuo representative. Thus, the gradually improving Japan-Soviet relations will become serious again.</p>
<p>Regarding the Inukai arrest incident, Outer Mongolia issued a statement to the Japanese and Manchukuo authorities, stating that Japanese officer Inukai and his Russian follower Habula were arrested in Mongolian territory. Moreover, the two had already been released before receiving the demands from Japan and Manchukuo. When these two were released, most of their belongings (including horses and carriages) were also returned. In order to further express its peaceful intentions, all of their detained belongings were returned to the Japanese officer and his companion. The Outer Mongolian side, in order to avoid further border incidents, also proposed convening a joint committee of "Mongolia" and "Manchukuo" on the spot to review various border incidents. In addition, it also made a statement that if it could be proven that they were arrested in Manchukuo territory, it would apologize to "Manchukuo" and punish the personnel responsible for the arrest. Judging from this statement, "Outer Mongolia" under Soviet influence can be said to have done everything possible to express goodwill and strive for peace. However, Japan still claims that the other party has no sincerity, which is likely to have an additional and active meaning.</p>
<p>Although, the deterioration of relations between Japan and the Soviet Union is not only enough to endanger world peace, but also not a blessing for the two countries themselves. On the Japanese side, military expenditures have expanded and national debt has increased in recent years. Even from the financial point of view alone, it still does not have the ability to break through the Soviet Union's Far East defense line. As for the Soviet Union, domestic construction projects are underway, and stopping for war would surely mean abandoning all previous efforts. Moreover, Europe still has concerns about the rear. Therefore, even if these two countries have fundamental contradictions, under the current circumstances, if the Japanese and Soviet authorities consider their own interests, they should not lightly start a war.</p>
<h3>Russian Ambassador Negotiates with Hirota - Border Committee Case - Soviet Ambassador Presents Opinions</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) Soviet Ambassador to Japan Yurenev visited Foreign Minister Hirota at the Foreign Ministry at 3:40 PM on the 10th. Based on instructions from his government, he presented a concrete Soviet plan for the establishment of a Japan-Manchukuo-Soviet border dispute mediation committee. It is said that the Soviet Union believes that the most appropriate way to organize the Japan-Manchukuo-Soviet border dispute mediation committee is to imitate the dispute mediation committee established with Romania, and should request your country's full consideration. Foreign Minister Hirota replied to this matter as follows: The example of the committee established by your country with Romania, as proposed by Your Excellency, is not the same as the content of the Japanese government's plan. I have received this information. It seems that the committee is responsible for handling the initial border disputes, but I have heard that since last year, it seems that it has been handled exclusively by diplomatic agencies. I have also heard that there are various agreements. I am still asking for your guidance on which year's Romanian agreement is indicated. The Soviet ambassador immediately said, "I will ask my country for instructions again. After investigation, I will reply immediately." The content of the border dispute settlement committee planned by the Soviet Union has now been clarified after his general proposal. The Japanese side is focusing on exploring the intentions of the Soviet Union and then dealing with it. Therefore, this issue has now entered the first step of concrete circumstances, and its future is highly valued. (United Press dispatch, 10th)</p>
<h3>Yugoslavia Declares War on Sharks - Coastal Areas are Often a Scourge - Patrol Ships are Dispatched to Inflict Heavy Damage</h3>
<p>Fiume: Yugoslav naval authorities, considering sharks a scourge in coastal areas, have specially declared war on sharks. A few days ago, two teenagers went out boating in a small boat and have not been seen since. Recently, a young girl disappeared while swimming by the sea. According to general speculation, they may all have died in the bellies of sharks. The naval authorities have now dispatched the cruiser "Dubrovnik" and several small ships to severely punish the sharks. (National Telegraph, 10th)</p>
<h3>Hopes for Peace in East Africa Dashed - Italy Presents New Proposals to Britain - Ambitious to Control Abyssinia - Demands Delineation of Political and Economic Spheres of Influence - Declares No Military Action Before September</h3>
<p>(London) The Italian Ambassador to Britain, Grandi, presented a proposal to the British Foreign Office yesterday regarding the resolution of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. According to this proposal, the Italo-Abyssinian conflict seems to have a chance of peaceful resolution. According to Italian sources in London, the outline of the Italian proposal is as follows:</p>
<p>(1) Italy should obtain a kind of political guarantee for the territory of Abyssinia inland between Italian Eritrea and Italian Somaliland, which in fact is equivalent to controlling that territory. (2) In addition to the above-mentioned territory, Italy's political and economic spheres of influence should be delineated in Abyssinia. Within these spheres of influence, Italy may reclaim wasteland and supervise the prohibition of the slave trade. It is reported that the British government has not yet decided to support this Italian request. It is likely that the three countries of Britain, France, and Italy, which signed the 1906 Abyssinian Treaty, must reach an agreement before Italy and Abyssinia can approach each other. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>The Hague: After the Italo-Abyssinian Mixed Arbitration Committee abandoned its work, the only way to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute is to follow the resolution of the League of Nations Executive Council on May 25th, in addition to the original four arbitrators from Italy and Abyssinia, to add a fifth neutral arbitrator appointed by the Executive Council. However, it is now reported that the Italian arbitrator refused to have the Executive Council appoint the fifth arbitrator, on the grounds that the issue of the arbitration committee's powers is only related to the governments of Italy and Abyssinia, so it cannot be resolved by a third party arbitration. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(Rome) Responsible parties here are making every effort to deny the claim that the Italian army in East Africa has already started its military plan or will soon take military action, saying that the rainy season in various parts of East Africa will not end until after September, and that the breakdown of the mediation committee has nothing to do with the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>Addis Ababa: Recently, there have been rumors that the situation on the Italo-Abyssinian border is tense and that war is imminent. However, according to official sources here, Addis Ababa has not received any such news. It is also said that the Abyssinian government has made the situation serious due to past disputes, so every action is now taken with caution. At present, there is no action that would immediately lead to war. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Arbitration Committee Breaks Down - Two Reasons - Italian Side Refuses to Discuss Border Issues - Believes it is Inconsistent with the Geneva Agreement</h3>
<p>The Hague: After the breakdown of the negotiations of the joint committee investigating the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, the members all returned to their destinations today. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(Rome) According to announcements here, there are two reasons for the suspension of the Italo-Abyssinian Conciliation Committee: (1) The Abyssinian representative did not know the details of the agreement between the Italian and Abyssinian governments on May 15th and 16th to appoint conciliation committee members. (2) The Abyssinian representative requested the committee to discuss border issues that should not be discussed, as this matter should be resolved by the border management committee stipulated in the 1908 Italo-Abyssinian Treaty. The two reasons can prove that Abyssinia intends to undermine the work of the committee, and the evidence of the Wallwal incident of Abyssinian atrocities presented by Italy is sufficient. Abyssinia now does not want to see the committee continue to work and be punished. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<p>The Hague: The Italo-Abyssinian Mixed Arbitration Committee has decided to abandon its work due to differing opinions and ineffective mediation. According to Abyssinian agent Guizi (Professor of Law at the University of Paris), Abyssinia's position is based on the Wallwal area being Abyssinian territory as a starting point, while the Italian agent refused to discuss the border issue. The Mixed Committee, considering that the scope of the assessment was limited, decided not to continue the meeting. Professor Guizi has issued a communiqué stating that "the Italian and Abyssinian arbitrators completely disagreed on whether to allow the agents of the two countries to present their views on the exact location of the Wallwal area. The Italian members, Macodi and Mondana, supported the Italian agent's claim, while the Abyssinian members, Terrappell and Bode, said that the views of the Italian and Abyssinian sides should be treated equally and allowed to be presented, which would not hinder the resolution of the problem. The committee will record this difference of opinion and decide to appoint a neutral arbitrator from a neutral country according to the resolution of the Executive Council on May 25. Guizi finally protested the committee's refusal to listen to his statement and intends to submit the arbitration committee's resolution to the League of Nations. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>The Hague: The Italian arbitrator of the Italo-Abyssinian Mixed Arbitration Committee gave a speech to the press, opposing the claims made by the Abyssinian government's agent, Guizi, saying that Guizi's presentation to the committee began by raising the issue of responsibility for the Wallwal invasion incident, but then suddenly raised the issue of the geographical location of Wallwal. Therefore, the Italian arbitrator refused to allow him to continue his presentation, because according to the compromise reached in Geneva on May 25 this year, the geographical location of Wallwal is not within the scope of the arbitration committee. At that time, the Abyssinian government formally expressed its agreement to submit only the facts and responsibilities of the conflict incident to the arbitration committee for review and not involve other matters. Now, the Abyssinian government has raised the issue of the geographical location of Wallwal because it will lose the case if it discusses the issue of responsibility for the invasion. It was also said that the Italian arbitrators had tried to save the committee's work twice. The first proposal was to first resolve the issue of the committee's powers and then discuss the remaining issues. This proposal was rejected by the Abyssinian side. The second proposal was to submit the issues that the committee could not resolve to the countries concerned for discussion, and then hold another arbitration committee meeting at a later date. This proposal was also rejected by the Abyssinian arbitrators. Therefore, the arbitration committee had to abandon its work. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Britain Continues Efforts to Find a Reconciliation Method - Avenol Active in London</h3>
<p>(London) It is reported that the British authorities have not yet formulated a special plan to withdraw British expatriates from Abyssinia, because the British authorities believe that there is no need to take this step in the current environment. At the same time, London is of course paying close attention to the development of the Italo-Abyssinian dispute. The British government is still continuing its efforts to find a reconciliation method when discussing with the French government. Regarding the visit of League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol to London, it is still kept secret, but it is generally believed that one of Avenol's main purposes in coming to Britain is to urge the great powers to make all possible efforts to resolve the dispute between Italy and Abyssinia before the League of Nations Executive Council meets to deal with this issue. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>(London) Minister for League of Nations Affairs Eden told the House of Commons today that Britain is currently considering possible ways to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, but does not want to take any steps that would make the situation more serious. League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol is also discussing the Italo-Abyssinian dispute with Foreign Secretary Hoare and Eden. (National Press Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol has been quite active since arriving here and will obviously do his best to eliminate the Italo-Abyssinian conflict. Yesterday, Avenol met with Foreign Secretary Hoare, Under-Secretary of State Eden, and Italian Ambassador Grandi. Today and tomorrow, he will discuss with Prime Minister Baldwin, Eden, and the Abyssinian Minister. The purpose is obviously to find a solution that will not cause the League of Nations to collapse due to the Italo-Abyssinian war, nor cause Italy to withdraw from the League of Nations due to League of Nations intervention. (National Press Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Improved Water Conservancy Plan - Britain Delays Implementation - Does Not Want to Increase the Seriousness of the Situation</h3>
<p>(London) The British government had planned to build a sluice around Lake Tana in Abyssinia to raise the lake level and improve the water conservancy of the upper Nile. The Abyssinian government did not object to this plan. When the House of Commons met today, a member of parliament specifically inquired about the matter. Under-Secretary of State Eden replied, "On May 10 this year, the Abyssinian government invited the governments of Britain, Egypt, and Sudan to send representatives to the Abyssinian capital to discuss the issue of building a sluice on Lake Tana. However, because an unfortunate dispute is occurring between Italy and Abyssinia, and the Italian and Abyssinian sides are making every effort to resolve the dispute, the British government does not want to take any steps at this time that would increase the seriousness of the situation. For this reason, the British government has specifically notified the governments of the countries concerned, saying that Britain advocates postponing discussions on the issue of building a sluice on Lake Tana. However, improving the water conservancy of the upper Nile is beneficial to both Egypt and Sudan, and is naturally supported by Britain. Moreover, this benefit has been recognized by the Abyssinian government and the French and Italian governments. Britain is now only waiting for a suitable opportunity to implement the plan to build a sluice on Lake Tana." (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Italian Semi-Official Newspaper - Advises Britain to Change its Policy - Do Not Be Too Serious About Maintaining the Credibility of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Rome) According to sources with inside information, it is speculated that Britain is about to change its current attitude towards the Abyssinian issue. A semi-official Italian daily newspaper published an article, observing Britain from the following four points: (1) Do not be too serious about the credibility of the League of Nations. (2) There should be a deeper understanding of Italy's legitimate needs. (3) Once Italy occupies Abyssinia, the threat to British interests in Africa is not necessarily greater than the threat to British interests from Abyssinia. (4) Do not despise European solidarity. It must be known that if a war breaks out in Europe, Britain may need this kind of solidarity. (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Italy Continues to Issue Orders - Conscripts Soldiers into the Army - Decides to Control Abyssinia by Force</h3>
<p>(Rome) The government has issued an order conscripting skilled soldiers in the 1909 and 1910 classes. Also, the Third Regiment of the Savoy (name of the Italian dynasty) Royal Elite Guards has recently drawn a battalion by lottery to go to Africa. When the soldiers heard the news of going to Africa, they all shouted "Long live the Prime Minister!" (Havas News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) The Daily Telegraph reported that according to estimates by the Italian Army General Staff, the country would need at least 400,000 soldiers to fight in Abyssinia. At this time, the troops sent to Africa are still less than 200,000. It also said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini does not refuse to hold negotiations to resolve the Abyssinian issue, but wants to hold negotiations outside of the League of Nations. Italy's goal is to completely control Abyssinia militarily, just as France controls Morocco. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Italian Prime Minister's Remarks - Made Specifically for Foreign Audiences - Expedition to East Africa is Intolerable - Many Italian Soldiers Complain About the Heat in Letters Home</h3>
<p>(London) The London Daily Telegraph's Rome correspondent reported today that the letters home from Italian soldiers all complained about the heat when passing through the Red Sea, because there were too many people and it was intolerably hot. The correspondent also said that Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech last Saturday was not published in Italy, so he believes that this speech was originally made for foreign audiences. (National News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>Ongert Appointed - US Chargé d'Affaires in Addis Ababa</h3>
<p>(Washington) The United States' concern about the Abyssinian situation can be seen in the State Department's rapid dispatch of a diplomatic representative to Addis Ababa. According to today's announcement here, Ongert, an expert in Near East issues and Eastern languages at the United States, has been appointed as the United States Chargé d'Affaires and Consul General in Addis Ababa. Ongert is currently the secretary of the US Embassy in Cairo and has been ordered to depart for Addis Ababa. The position of US Chargé d'Affaires in Addis Ababa was originally appointed to former US Consul General in Harbin, Henson. However, because Henson is not familiar with Near East affairs and does not understand Arabic, he has now been reassigned as Consul General in Salonica. The International Women's League for Peace and Freedom has protested to the State Department, accusing the United States of intending to support Italy's aggression against Abyssinia, because both Italy and Abyssinia are signatories to the Kellogg-Briand Pact. Abyssinia's request for American intervention and America's obligation to intervene are both morally imperative. Hull's reply to the Abyssinian emperor should not have avoided responsibility in this way. (National News Agency, 9th)</p>
<h3>War is Imminent - Foreigners Flee Abyssinia</h3>
<p>(London) According to a correspondent for the Daily Express stationed in Addis Ababa, American and other foreigners in Abyssinia have now begun to withdraw. A train full of foreigners near Addis Ababa left for the border, because the armies of Italy and Abyssinia are now deploying along the lines of Abyssinia, Eritrea, and Italian Somaliland. Officials close to the Abyssinian king said today that we are ready to go to war at any time. (National News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>Britain Actively Trains Aviation Talent - Five New Aviation Schools Added Nationwide</h3>
<p>(London) The Ministry of Aviation announced that the government will add five new aviation schools in the near future to train pilots and train reserve pilots. It also said that the "London University Flying Team" is being formed and will begin service on October 1. On May 22 this year, former Aviation Minister, the Earl of Londonderry, announced in the House of Lords a Royal Air Force expansion plan, saying that the British Air Force headquarters, in addition to naval aircraft, will add first-line aircraft to a total of 1,500 within two years, and the number of pilots will increase by 2,500. The addition of five aviation schools is part of the above plan. (Havas News Agency, 10th)</p>
<h3>New Cabinet's First Victory in the British House of Commons - Labour Party Proposes Impeachment for Failure to Relieve Unemployment - Ultimately Defeated by 450 to 76 Votes - Lloyd George Dissatisfied That the New Deal Was Not Adopted</h3>
<p>(London) Baldwin's government was tested for the first time in the House of Commons tonight and was safe, because the Labour Party moved for impeachment due to the government's failure to formulate a plan to deal with unemployment. It was then put to a vote and defeated by 450 to 76 votes. This motion was proposed by Greenwood, the Minister of Health in the first MacDonald government and now a Labour Party member. Greenwood said that the government has no strategy to deal with unemployment, and its handling of the problems in affected areas is also not serious enough. The unemployment problem must be solved by shortening working hours, so that the reduced time can be used to find jobs for the unemployed. The government's attitude towards the shorter work week is shameful to a great country. The government now claims that it has improved commerce, but in fact the government has done nothing to contribute to this.</p>
<p>Baldwin replied, reviewing the progress of the government's economic and financial policies, and asked the opposition party to present evidence that any other country in the world has made more progress than Britain in the past three or four years. He also said that they have seen a certain great power using national funds on an unprecedentedly large scale, which has created some good results, but has not yet been able to revive the national industry. Britain does not approve of this kind of huge expense unless it can definitely create a revival. Britain has not hesitated to spend huge sums on construction projects such as reorganizing the shipping industry, eliminating excess yarn spindles in Lancashire, and improving London's transportation. Britain's working conditions are the best in the world. The current cost of living has fallen by 20% compared to 1934, while changes in currency and wages have fallen by less than 5%. The government's policy is to create an atmosphere of trust. The Ottawa Agreement and the tariffs used to negotiate reciprocal treaties also provide some solutions to this problem. The world's uneasy state is what causes people to panic, believing that resistance will come from unexpected sources. Therefore, national credit, whether domestic or foreign, must not be damaged in the slightest. The cost of public works must be justified only if the following conditions are met: that this cost can revitalize industry, so that the people can afford this financial burden and maintain the continuation of its progress when the funds are exhausted. The Prime Minister then spoke of the problems in the areas suffering from unemployment, saying that this matter is still one of the most difficult things the government faces. The report of the Unemployment Area Investigation Committee will soon be submitted to the government. He hopes that the government can improve it based on its recommendations.</p>
<p>Liberal Party Sinclair criticized the government's economic policy, blaming the government for not having a large-scale construction plan to develop natural resources and reduce the number of unemployed.</p>
<p>Former Prosecutor-General Cripps represented the Labour Party in the final debate, and his remarks were largely the same as those made by Greenwood, saying that the government does not have a plan that can adapt to the ever-changing situation, causing the people to suffer.</p>
<p>Finally, Simon spoke, saying that Britain's manufacturing production has caught up with the level of 1929. France is 29% lower than 1929, Germany is 15% lower, and the United States is even lower, reaching 37%. Since the establishment of the national unity government, the number of unemployed has decreased by one million. The British people, with a steady spirit, reject arrogant attempts and encourage planned efforts to seek progress. They are now gradually passing through an extremely difficult period and moving towards the goal of revival. All countries in the world are jealous and envious of it.</p>
<p>Reuters has learned that Lloyd George believes that the remarks made by the Prime Minister are an expression of rejection of his New Deal plan. Therefore, he has sent a letter to the Prime Minister requesting the lifting of the promise not to publish his New Deal plan. Also, when voting on the Labour Party's motion today, Lloyd George, Samuel, and other Liberal Party members supported the Labour Party. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<h3>1935 German Naval Construction Budget Estimated at 100 Million Marks</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The 1935 German naval program, which stipulates the construction of two 26,000-ton battleships and two 10,000-ton cruisers, is regarded by the German press as "moderate." According to press reports, the new battleships will be modeled after the French 26,500-ton Dunkerque-class battleships. The French ships are armed with eight 13-inch guns. However, the heaviest German gun is 11-inch, so the new battleships will be armed with eight 11-inch guns. The two 10,000-ton cruisers will likely be modeled after the famous "pocket battleships." The cost of the 1935 naval program has not yet been announced, but private estimates suggest it will be around 100 million marks. In addition to the battleships and cruisers, the program also includes 16 destroyers and 28 submarines. (Reuters, 10th)</p>
<p>French Reaction</p>
<p>(Paris) News here today suggests that France believes Germany plans to build 400,000 tons of warships within three to four years. Therefore, it is generally expected that France will refuse to send naval representatives to London to discuss naval issues. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>American Viewpoint</p>
<p>(Washington) High-ranking naval authorities today noted that Germany will align with Britain and Japan on the issue of battleship size, opposing the American policy of large ships. This view is inferred from Germany's newly announced shipbuilding plan, as Germany has decided to build 26,000-ton battleships. Britain and Japan, for economic reasons and because their territories are compact with naval ports spread throughout, are also striving to reduce ship sizes to this extent. However, American military experts do not agree, as the seakeeping capabilities of smaller battleships are insufficient for crossing vast oceans. Experts hope that France may build larger battleships in the future to counter Germany, thus aligning with American policy. Currently, only Italy in Europe adheres to the large-ship doctrine. American experts believe that Germany's small submarines will not disrupt other countries' navies, as such submarines are inadequate for use outside German coastal waters.

<h3>Yugoslav Regency Prepares to Invite Romanian King, Foreign Policy Follows Preceding King's Policy, New Prime Minister Gradually Gains Popular Support</h3>
<p>Romanian Capital News of the Yugoslav Regent Prince Paul's invitation to the Romanian King has recently been confirmed by officials. The Prince is scheduled to reside at the Sinaia Palace for three days at the end of this week. King Carol will receive him with the honors due to a distinguished guest, holding a grand banquet attended by all cabinet members. According to semi-official sources, the late Yugoslav monarch Alexander frequently met with King Carol, especially when diplomatic activities were particularly active, he would always contact King Carol. Prince Paul's visit to Romania is a continuation of the traditional policy of the preceding King. Political figures believe that Prince Paul's meeting with King Carol, in which Romanian Foreign Minister Titulescu will also participate, will allow the Little Entente political conference to be held in a timely manner. The conference was originally scheduled to convene on June 20, but was postponed until now due to the resignation of the Yugoslav Jevtić cabinet. (Havas, 10th)</p>
<p>Belgrade The new Prime Minister Stojadinović is gradually gaining popular support and is about to take the place of his political rival, former Prime Minister Jevtić. Jevtić's party won a total of 303 seats in the general election in May but split into two factions yesterday. Two hundred of them proposed to form a new party to support Prime Minister Stojadinović, so the new Prime Minister will thus obtain more than two-thirds of the votes in Parliament. The remaining thirty-five still support Jevtić, and another sixty or seventy are forming a separate independent party. The Croatian opposition leader Maček despises the parliament, because Maček previously thought that Prime Minister Stojadinović would disregard his promise of internal stability and continue to adopt his predecessor's policies towards Croats.

<h3>American Silver Policy: Abandoned or Changed?</h3>
<p>Silver Market Plummets, US Uses Stabilization Fund to Rescue, Near and Far Prices Equal for First Time This Year</p>
<p>(New York) The recent developments in the silver market can be seen as an indication that the US Treasury Department has not abandoned its silver purchasing policy. The Treasury is now continuing to purchase silver according to the policy recently announced by Treasury Secretary Morgenthau, that is, making reasonable purchases based on the current supply and demand situation, rather than aggressive purchases, in order to maximize profits. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau is now operating in the silver market like an experienced merchant, buying when prices fall and stopping when prices rise. At the same time, silver-supporting lawmakers are closely monitoring developments. It is said that silver-supporting senators are very dissatisfied with the progress of the silver program and are currently collecting statistical data to make the petition to be submitted to President Roosevelt more effective. (Reuters, 9th)</p>
<p>(London) Today's silver prices, near and far, are equal, which is the first time this year. This shows that the future of the US government's silver policy is indeed uncertain. Silver traders are very uneasy because they see that the US silver purchase plan has changed significantly. They originally hoped that the US Treasury Department would continue to purchase in large quantities, so they hoarded a lot, but recently, due to uncertainty, they began to sell, and silver prices plummeted. (National News Agency, 9th)</p>
<p>(New York) The British pound has reached its highest price this year today. The reason is that the US Treasury Department continues to purchase silver directly in London. According to news here, all the spot silver sold in London has been purchased by the Treasury Department at market prices. Since the Treasury Department has purchased so much spot silver, it must of course purchase British pounds, so the price of British pounds in New York has also risen accordingly. Today, the Treasury Department purchased a total of 15 million ounces of spot silver in London, and the total amount purchased in the past three days is about 40 to 50 million ounces.</p>
<p>(London) The US government, due to the urgent request of British silver brokers, used its $200 million stabilization fund today to rescue the collapsing silver market. Because all parties sold off today, especially from the Far East, the silver market was in a stalemate for as long as fifty minutes, with no one buying. The short sellers then attacked the market fiercely, and brokers had to postpone setting prices. Only after the US government agreed to purchase did the price settle at 30 25/32 pence. It has been confirmed here that the US Treasury Department absorbed as much as 15 million ounces at this price, and the sharp drop in silver prices was thus prevented. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<p>(Washington) The Treasury Department today declined to confirm or comment on the reports from London that the United States had used its stabilization fund to maintain silver prices. However, government experts criticized speculators for their inability to judge market trends. Non-official experts today believe that the US purchase of spot silver may be to maintain price stability on the one hand and to avoid accusations from the outside world that the United States caused the dramatic changes in the silver market on the other. However, it is also obvious that the United States should seek lower prices when purchasing silver in order to save money. (National Telegram, 9th)</p>
<h3>HSBC Bank Dividend Reduced, London Not Surprised</h3>
<p>Shanghai Financial Tide Affected by US Silver Policy, Future of Silver Still a Focus of Attention</p>
<p>(London) The announcement of HSBC Bank's dividend is generally considered to be unwelcome but not truly alarming. However, several reporters said that the fall in the bank's stock price today shows that the market did not initially expect the reduction in dividends. The Times said that trade with China is becoming increasingly difficult, and has recently been exacerbated by the financial tide in Shanghai. The Shanghai financial tide was triggered by the US silver policy and the instability of silver exchange rates in the Far East. Although this is enough to encourage Chinese importers, it will of course have an adverse reaction on trade with China. The Financial Times said that trade with China is currently declining, and the Daily Telegraph reported that the general exchange business must be hindered by the abnormal silver market. In London, it is thought that the reduction in HSBC Bank's dividends is merely a cautious measure, while the Morning Post recalled that the bank's dividend in 1929 was only £2 5s. The future of silver is still a point of concern for the general public. The total amount of silver sold in the past three days is estimated to be 40 million ounces. Previous estimates said that many parties are currently overbought, with a figure of as much as 100 million ounces, but these have since been deemed inaccurate. Today's silver trend is more solid, mainly due to a lack of sellers. It is generally felt that as a result of recent events, the market is now more stable. Some brokers are now unsure how long the US will continue to purchase silver, while others say that the US silver policy is part of a concrete plan to increase its monetary reserves and raise prices. Apart from the US silver policy, the influence of Japanese policy and its significant pressure on China is also a matter of great speculation for the general public, with diverse opinions and no consensus.

<h3>New York State Flood, Worst in Fifty Years</h3>

<p>(New York) Floods in New York State have inundated thirty towns and villages, leaving over two thousand people temporarily homeless. This disaster is the worst in New York State in fifty years.

<h3>Chairman Chiang's Speech at Sichuan University: The Purpose of Learning and the Essentials of Studying (Continued) - The Purpose of Learning is to Save the Country and the People - Teaching, Learning, and Doing Should Be Integrated</h3>
<p>Simply put, we must pay attention to the implementation of education at all times and in all places, so that every citizen can become a healthy citizen. Everyone should know that education is not limited to schools. Don't think that there is no education outside of schools. In addition to schools, families have family education, and society has social education. We have the responsibility to educate our family members and general relatives and friends, as well as the general public in society. Even for our own elders, if they have outdated ideas or selfish and self-interested disregard for the nation and the people, we must do our duty to persuade them and make them understand their responsibilities as citizens and correct all old and bad mentalities. If we can fulfill our responsibilities in this way, then all the people in society will surely be able to strive for progress, create a new society, and build a new country. This is about the educational responsibility that everyone should bear for the general public. Secondly, I will briefly talk to you about the meaning of education and the basic essentials of education. The so-called education originally includes two things: "teaching" and "nurturing." "Teaching" emphasizes the transmission and practice of all academic skills and the principles of being a person. "Nurturing" emphasizes the conservation and training of physical, mental, moral, and life aspects. Although "teaching" and "nurturing" are two different things, they are closely related to each other. They must be given equal importance and implemented at the same time, and then it can be considered complete education. Now, people in the general education field often do not understand this principle. They only pay attention to "teaching" and inevitably neglect "nurturing." Because if you only teach but not nurture, the result is that you can't even teach well. This kind of flawed and inferior phenomenon can be said to be a common problem in our Chinese education now. Take the current situation in Sichuan as an example. In my opinion, the physiques of young students in Sichuan, whether in universities or middle schools, are very thin and their spirits are very listless. Compared with Yunnan students, they are far behind. In Yunnan, not only male students in general have very good physiques, but also female students in general have very healthy physiques. Now, the physiques of male and female students in Sichuan are not only inferior to those in Yunnan, but probably not as good as those in any other province. This is the result of those responsible for education generally teaching but not nurturing. This is a major shortcoming of Sichuan's education and the biggest crisis for our nation, as well as the most unfortunate thing for young students in general. I hope that all faculty and staff, as well as graduated or non-graduated students, should pay special attention to the cultivation of spirit and physique. If the spirit and physique cannot be healthy, not only will you not be able to study, but you will not be able to do anything. Therefore, if we want to enable general students to create a healthy talent, we must implement reasonable stimulation education, education that emphasizes both teaching and nurturing. In terms of "teaching," there is also a distinction between broad and narrow senses. Narrowly defined "teaching" only emphasizes the teaching of academic skills. This is a very biased and incomplete education. Broadly defined "teaching" is what I said in the last two memorial week appearances: we must take rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and mathematics as the basic content of education. It not only emphasizes the teaching of academics, but also emphasizes the cultivation of spirit and morality and the teaching and training of physique. Only in this way can it be considered the implementation of a complete education that emphasizes both teaching and nurturing. Students, reflect on whether you are now able to fully pay attention to the cultivation of these six arts, and whether you have already possessed the six arts. For example, in terms of rites, the various etiquettes in form, such as standing at attention, raising hands, bowing, etc., are still small rites, and the most important thing in rites is the rules of the whole life, that is, what the ancients called sweeping and cleaning, responding, advancing and retreating. You must sweep and clean with etiquette, respond with etiquette, advance and retreat with etiquette, and extend it to every move, every word and every action, all with etiquette, that is, all with certain order and rules, doing everything perfectly. Now, students, do you all sweep and clean yourselves? Are all places cleaned very cleanly and in an orderly manner? Are you respectful and courteous to teachers? Do you abide by the rules and discipline of the school? When I went to Mingyuan Building to rest today, I saw that the place was still very dirty. You think it is very clean, but it is not clean at all. Like this, if you can't even sweep and clean your own school, how can you take on the responsibility of saving the country and the people when you leave the school in the future? As the ancients said, "If a room cannot be governed, how can the world and the country be governed?" It can be seen that although sweeping is a small thing, if small things cannot be done well, how can you do great things to govern the country and pacify the world? Therefore, everyone must start from small things and achieve that everything can be polite and law-abiding. As for the importance of music, I believe everyone knows it too. Xunzi said, "Music can improve the people's hearts, its influence is deep, and it can change customs and habits." The Book of Music says, "Rites, music, criminal law, and politics are all ultimately the same, so as to unite the people's hearts and bring forth the way of governance." All of these are about the importance of music to the governance, chaos, security, and danger of the world and the country. From this, we can know that music is a basic academic and cultivation for us to save the country and the people. Then, talking about archery and horsemanship, in addition to their technical value, they can also be used to cultivate our morality, spirit, and physique. In addition, the two items of writing and mathematics, now, are the various sciences from referring to writing and mathematics, all of which are basic knowledge that we must have to save the country and the people. Broadly defined teaching must at the same time take rites, music, archery, horsemanship, writing, and mathematics as the basic content, and implement it perfectly. This is talking about the teaching aspect. As for the nurturing aspect, the most important point now is to pay special attention to physical education and hygiene. Now in our China, not only is the physique of the general public becoming weaker day by day, but the physique of young students in general is also not good. This is really a great crisis for the future of the nation. Examining the reasons, although there are many, the biggest relationship is that people in general do not pay attention to physical education and hygiene. They sit in the house every day without exercising, and they can't even get sunlight, and the air is not fresh. In this way, how can the physique be good? If the physique is not healthy, of course there is no healthy spirit. If there is no healthy spirit, of course you can't do any healthy career. Therefore, if we want to do something for society and the country, we must first pay attention to physical education and hygiene. In particular, young students in general must exercise their physique. If we can all step up our exercise, I believe that after three years, everyone will be able to fulfill the responsibility of saving the nation and revitalizing it. If everyone is still accustomed to being weak and continues to be depressed, I am afraid that even if our education is run for another hundred years or a thousand years, it will not benefit the country and the nation at all, and may even cause endless harm. Now, why do foreigners not treat us Chinese as people, and scold us as a bunch of worms that are not even as good as birds and beasts? It is because they laugh at our general weakness of the whole country's power. This is such a shameful and painful thing. If we want to protect ourselves and protect the country, and wash away our shame and seek strength, it is necessary for every citizen to first be able to strengthen himself. The first thing is to forge a strong physique. Now we are really too weak. Look at our 70 million people in Sichuan, can we choose one person out of every hundred people whose physique is as good as that of a foreigner? I think it is probably not easy to choose a few out of a thousand people. The physique of the people is so weak that they cannot do even a little bit of hard work at ordinary times. One day, when the foreign troubles are imminent, although they can bravely throw themselves into the rain of bullets and bullets with temporary courage, they may not be able to support their bodies after being invaded by hunger, hardship, cold and heat for one or two days. How can they protect the country and defend the people? Therefore, if our nation does not want to survive in the world, then we must all be determined to strengthen ourselves in the future, especially to hurry up and pay attention to physical education and hygiene, so that all of our 400 million compatriots have strong bodies and invigorated spirits. We know that the strength of a country and the prosperity or decline of a nation are determined by the physique of the people and the excellence of their morals. We advocate physical education to make the people's bodies stronger, but the purpose is not to bully people with force, but to strengthen ourselves, be self-reliant, self-defend and defend the country. Therefore, on the one hand, we must have the power to defend ourselves, and on the other hand, we must have noble morals, that is, to restore our nation's inherent morals of "loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace," that is, to possess the martial virtues of "wisdom, faith, benevolence, courage, and strictness" that I spoke of last time. We must show the spirit of "knowing etiquette, knowing shame, taking responsibility, and abiding by discipline" of our national people everywhere. Everyone should know, where is the strength of our poor and weak country? It is not how many people there are, how many troops there are, that is strength. Only when our general people have strong physiques, superior spirits, noble morals, and can abide by discipline, value order, know etiquette and know shame, then this is the true strength of a poor and weak country. Therefore, I advocate four slogans as the foundation of our nation's spirit of nation-building. These four slogans are "knowing etiquette, knowing shame, taking responsibility, and abiding by discipline." We must all respect etiquette and abide by the law, be brave to do what is right, take responsibility, and strictly abide by discipline, because if a person can "know etiquette and know shame," this person will definitely be able to strengthen himself. If he can "take responsibility and abide by discipline," this person will definitely be able to be self-reliant. People who can be self-reliant and self-strengthening will definitely not seek help from others. This kind of personality that does not seek help from others is greater than any force. Now, the spiritual strength of our country has increased many times compared to the past. A few years ago, the general people only knew how to rely on personal courage and could not be like the ancients who said, "Hold on to your ambition, do not be violent in your spirit," and persevere in fighting. Today, the general progress of the general people, although not much, but most people have been able to abide by discipline, value order, and listen to orders. Everyone has been able to gradually unite and strengthen themselves with perseverance. This cannot be regarded as a very good phenomenon and a great progress. But if we want to truly enhance our national strength, we must pay special attention to physical education and hygiene as I just said, so that our general people, especially our young students in general, can make progress in physical, moral, and intellectual education at the same time, and then we can truly enrich our national strength, the foundation of the country can be stable, and the revitalization of the nation can be guaranteed. In short, now everyone must know that our country is in extreme danger and that our own country's strength is not enough, so everyone should learn desperately, work hard, and constantly silver-chain their physique to create healthy talents to repay our country and nation and complete the mission of the revolution. Finally, there is one more important principle, that is, education should focus on cultivating the habit of labor and promoting the spirit of service. Everyone must know that education and labor are inseparable. If you only learn but do not labor, sit and talk but do not act, no matter how good your learning and ideals are, it does not matter. This kind of learning is not true learning. Therefore, "teaching," "learning," and "doing" should be integrated, and "labor," "production," and "education" are actually an inseparable chain, and the most basic point is to make the general students develop the habit of labor and develop the spirit of service. If you do not develop the habit of labor in school, you will definitely not be able to endure hardship when you leave school in the future. Not only will you not be willing to serve the public, but as a result, you will become a useless and parasitic parasite in society. Is this still a truly educated student? Can you still be a leader in saving the country and the people? Therefore, we must practice labor in our daily life in school and develop habits. For example, the sweeping and cleaning mentioned earlier can be used as a starting point for developing the habit of labor. If you despise labor and do nothing, and even now you are not willing to pick up brooms, can you sacrifice for the country on the battlefield in the future? We want to do the cause of saving the country and the people, that is, to serve and labor for the country and the people. In ancient and modern times, both at home and abroad, all those who can achieve great success and establish great careers have not been accustomed to diligence and endurance to suffer and encourage themselves. Now our country and nation are in a time of crisis of survival, and if everyone does not labor to serve the society and the country to enrich the strength of the society and the country, how can it be revived? From now on, on the one hand, everyone should encourage themselves with this, and on the other hand, they should do their best to teach the general public at all times and in all places, so that they can all "know etiquette, know shame, take responsibility, and abide by discipline," and everyone can labor and serve for the society and the country, in order to achieve the goal of saving the country together. The above points are the responsibilities that our general faculty and staff, as well as leaders from all walks of life and the general intellectuals in society, should bear and the important principles that must be practiced. At this final juncture of the country's survival, everyone should work hard to encourage themselves and strive to be enterprising, so as to fulfill your responsibility of saving Sichuan and saving the country. Our nation, since the Yellow Emperor, has had a glorious history of 5,000 years and the most noble culture. Our Chinese people are truly the most outstanding nation in the world. Now we are not afraid that the glory of our ancestors cannot be restored, nor are we afraid that the country cannot be saved and the nation cannot be revived, but we are only afraid that we cannot be self-reliant and self-strengthening. If everyone does everything according to what I said from now on, everyone can be worthy of being a righteous Chinese citizen, and will surely be able to build my Sichuan, create a new country, revive the nation, and complete the great cause of the revolution (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Yangtze River - Serious Disaster in the Upper Reaches - Wuhan Continuously Breaches Four Dykes, Number of Disaster Victims Increases to Over 40,000 -襄河 Water Continues to Rise, People in Yigu and Other Counties Mostly Drowned</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: The weather cleared up today. The Yangtze River water in Wuhan only rose one inch. The Jianghan Customs water gauge recorded 48 feet and 9 inches, which seems to be stabilizing. However, the dykes and embankments along the Yangtze River are collapsing one after another. Four dykes in Wuhan collapsed today. The river water can be discharged, and the rise is not fierce, probably because of this. However, we cannot be optimistic too soon. On the Wuchang side, the Baihe Dyke downstream of Qingshan was not taken care of because it was outside the scope of the provincial capital's flood control. Continuous heavy rain destroyed it, and the dyke body was not strong. This morning at 9 o'clock, it collapsed. Wuchang, Jiayu, Chengning, and Puqi counties were all affected, and the main dykes such as Wuhui are still not out of danger. On the Hankou side, Zhutai Temple in Qiaokou and Changfeng Beiyuan collapsed at 2 pm today. Changfeng Nanyuan is in extreme danger. The dyke is connected to the Zhanggong Dyke. After the dyke collapsed, the Zhanggong Dyke also leaked more severely. The Fenjin Furnace and Danshui Pond under the Japanese Concession, as well as the foot of the Pinghan Railway dyke, either leaked water very quickly or had very long cracks. If the river water rises again, it will be difficult to prevent. On the Hanyang side, after the Sanhe Yuan overflowed, the Sanheli Dyke and Yuehu Dyke were difficult to support. They collapsed at the same time at 7 am today. The houses and fields within the dyke were all submerged, and the losses were incalculable. It is found that the dykes that were broken today all belong to the people's dykes. Since the Baihe Dyke collapsed because it was designated outside the flood control area, the Changjiao Beiyuan was not 时. The Public Security Bureau of the Sixteenth Branch Office once notified the Jianghan Engineering Bureau by telephone, requesting that measures be taken to rescue the danger. The Engineering Bureau believed that the dyke belonged to the people's dyke and instructed the people to rescue themselves, so it could not avoid collapse. The Sanhe Yuan in Hanyang was even more beyond the authorities' ability to take care of. Now, the dykes in Hankou are being processed and raised to the highest record of the Jianghan Customs water gauge, and Wuchang is also raised one foot uniformly, but no one is paying attention to Hanyang, which is very unfair. As for the areas flooded by the three towns, Hankou has less, Wuchang is still the same as yesterday, and Hanyang has expanded especially, accounting for about four-fifths of the city. For example, Meijia Lane, Yangjiahe Street, Wusheng Street, Quanchang Street, Gaogong Street, Gaogong Hou Street, Xinglong First and Second Lanes, Jijiazui, Fulai Street, Longquan Lane, Renyi Lane, Yuehu Street, and Fuxingli are continuing to be flooded. Thirty-four of the 50 posts of the Public Security Bureau have been immersed in water. The police are patrolling and performing their duties. According to the investigation and statistics of the Provincial Public Security Bureau on the 9th, a total of 139 streets and 15,443 households in Wuyang were flooded. The number of disaster victims increased from more than 10,000 to 47,149 in one day. About 10,000 or more are in extreme poverty and waiting to die. The disaster situation is so serious that it has become serious. The Wuhan All-Circles Flood Relief Joint Association initiated by the Xingying has already started preparations today and will be established within days. The provincial government also held an emergency meeting today and stipulated nine measures for flood control and disaster relief: (1) Flood control work is to be the responsibility of the original flood control agency; (2) Investigation and management of engineering materials is to be the responsibility of the municipal agency; (3) The selection of soil yards is to be the responsibility of the flood control agency and the municipal agency; (4) Transportation matters are to be the responsibility of the Construction Department, the Hankou Municipal Government, and the Provincial Public Security Bureau; (5) Ship requisition is to be the responsibility of the Water Police Bureau; (6) Food investigation and adjustment is to be the responsibility of the Civil Affairs Department and the Hankou Municipal Government; (7) Disaster relief is to be the responsibility of the Civil Affairs Department, the Hankou Municipal Government, and the Provincial Relief Association; (8) People's service is to be the responsibility of the Public Security Bureaus; (9) The maintenance of public security is to be the responsibility of the Garrison Command and the Public Security Bureaus. After the meeting, Lang ordered the responsible agencies to work hard.</p>
<p>The flood situation in the upper reaches of the counties is even more serious than in Wuhan. The main reports from various parties today are as follows: (1) Xu Yuanquan telegraphed that since the Jiangling Dyke collapsed, the water was so high that it directly hit Jingzhou Caoshi. The people and houses in the northwest and west gates of Jingzhou were almost completely submerged. Countless people drowned outside the earthen city. Caoshi was completely submerged. Two-thirds of the people drowned. Those who survived either climbed to the top of the trees, or occupied the roof, or climbed to the highlands, extending their necks and waiting for rescue. If they do not die in the water, they will die of hunger, and they saw an old woman who was so hungry that she ate the part of her son, and still had two legs left, placing them in her arms, which is more painful than exchanging sons for food and killing wives to feed soldiers. (2) Xiao Zhichu telegraphed that six or seven feet of the east city wall of Zheng County were washed away by water. The southeast urban area has been reduced to a Ze country. Houses have collapsed, and the disaster situation is very serious. The magnitude of the water is unprecedented in nearly a hundred years. (3) Commissioner Cheng Zairun telegraphed that mountain torrents broke out, and the Han River rose sharply. The three counties of Guanghua, Yicheng, and Gucheng were a vast ocean. The loss of people's lives and property is incalculable. Xiangyang exceeded the water level by one foot and two inches on the 6th. On the morning of the 7th, it rose more than eight feet in fifteen minutes. It now exceeds the water level by two feet and four inches. The inner city is surrounded by water on all sides, and the city walls are collapsing everywhere. Fancheng is the same as sinking into the sea. (4) Rong Jingfang telegraphed that the disaster in Gucheng was even more tragic than 20 years ago. Although the city wall has not completely collapsed, countless people and animals have been drowned. The entire city of Laohekou was flooded, 3,000 buildings were destroyed, countless people drowned, and more than 10,000 people were rescued. (5) Zhang Wanxin telegraphed that mountain torrents broke out in Yidu and flowed everywhere, becoming a country of Ze. The water level exceeded the water level of 20 years by more than three feet. Houses were washed away, and the death of people and animals is innumerable. The most tragic was Caodian. The water depth was more than two feet. All the people in the town were drowned. Only three or four families survived. It is estimated that the Yangtze River from Yichang and the Xiang River from Yun County to Hankou, all counties have been affected by the disaster. Chairman Chiang, who was stationed in Sichuan to supervise the suppression of remnant bandits, was extremely concerned about the Yangtze River flood. On the 8th, he telegraphed the military and political leaders of Hunan, Hubei, Jiangxi, Anhui, Jiangsu, Henan, and Shaanxi provinces, He Chengjun, Yang Hucheng, He Jian, Gu Zhutong, Shao Lizi, Zhang Qun, Liu Zhenhua, Chen Guofu, Xiao Zhichu, Pang Bingxun, Rong Jingfang, and Ye Peng, instructing flood control and rescue work. The telegram said, "After investigating the continuous rain and mountain torrents, there is concern about the flood along the river. I hope that you will transfer the troops stationed along the river to assist local agencies and the people in the vicinity of the garrison in flood prevention and rescue work. You should also prevent the looting of refugees after the flood to prevent trouble before it happens and report the situation at any time. Chiang Kai-shek, Geng Yin." (9th)</p>
<h3>Interruption of Pinghan Transportation - People in the Huangshipo and Minggang Areas Dug Up Roads to Drain Water - Highways and Power Lines Destroyed within Hubei Province</h3>
<p>Hankou Correspondence: During the serious flood period, traffic in various places was obstructed. The Pinghan Road has been closed for two days. The Huangtupo Railway Bridge and the Xin'an Shop Roadbed on the road in the southern part of Henan Province were washed away by the flood on the 8th. The 22nd Changpiao train heading north on the evening of the 7th and the 2nd Special Express train heading north on the morning of the 8th were both diverted back to Xinyang. The trains leaving Pingnan stopped at Zhengcheng. According to the driver, in addition to being washed away by the water, there was also the matter of the people digging up the road. The roadbed in the area of Huangshipo Minggang was filled with very high soil, like a dam. This time, the water on the west side of the road could not be discharged. The general villagers stole and dug up the roadbed. The Pinghan Road Administration sent workers there on the 8th, but it has not yet been repaired. On the 9th, another train was sent, carrying a large number of road guards to suppress it. If the water recedes, it may be repaired and opened to traffic within two or three days. Within Hubei Province, the Hanyi, Edong, Xiangru, and Xianghua highways were mostly flooded or destroyed, and all traffic was interrupted.

The former acting Chairman Zhang Houwan, Secretary Wei Jian, Chief of the Provincial Capital Public Security Bureau Miao Zuoxin, Magistrate of Qingyuan County Xiao Heyan, and more than 600 members of the gentry and business community of Baoding welcomed them at the station. After Shang and others got off the train, they went to a private residence in Dajinxian Hutong to rest. At 9 PM that evening, accompanied by various provincial committee members and National Government supervisor Hu Yixianglin, they attended a banquet hosted by Zhang Houwan at Lotus Pond, with the former provincial committee members as escorts. The guests and hosts enjoyed themselves until around 10 PM, after which Shang and the provincial committee members returned to the private residence in Dajinxian Hutong and decided to hold the swearing-in ceremony on the 8th.</p>
<p>At 9 AM on the 8th, Shang Zhen and the provincial committee members held the swearing-in ceremony. More than 300 people attended, including personnel from the provincial government and various departments, representatives from the Beiping Military Branch, guests from various circles, and representatives from various organizations. After the ceremony, Shang Zhen first received the seal, followed by Supervisor Hu Xianglin delivering a speech, and Shang Zhen responding. The ceremony concluded around 10 AM, followed by a photo session, and then the meeting adjourned.</p>
<p>According to Shang's interview with reporters, "I was delayed in leaving Ping until 2 PM on the 7th because I was waiting in Ping for the provincial committee members and meeting with acting Chairman Wang. All the newly appointed provincial committee members came with me. Committee Member Nan Guixin has withdrawn his resignation intentions. He is currently on leave due to dysentery. I have been out of politics for several years. This time, I am shouldering an important task again, and I feel that my talents and knowledge are shallow. Moreover, I received an urgent telegram from the Central Government at a time when the country is facing many difficulties, so I dared to take on this position. Relieving the suffering of the people and stabilizing the people's hearts are my greatest concerns. Therefore, I have decided to first stabilize the people's hearts, and second, to work hard to relieve the suffering of the people. I will carefully investigate all matters concerning the reform of provincial administration. Therefore, I plan to visit famous counties within a week to gain a deep understanding of the true situation of the people and use it as a starting point for joint office work. I will strive to achieve this in the short term. The talk of moving the provincial government to Ping has become a thing of the past. The 32nd Army Headquarters is still in Beiping. The security department is the responsibility of each division commander. In the future, I will govern the province for a long time, and I will also have to go to Beiping and Tianjin from time to time. In addition to the Public Security Bureau, the security of the provincial capital will be the responsibility of Zhu's division of the 53rd Army. Zhu and I know each other well, so there should be no problems. I will only transfer a regiment of guards to protect the provincial government. The 53rd Army Headquarters is moving to Baoding, and Commander Wan and various departments are also preparing."</p>
<p>The newly appointed provincial committee members and department heads have all arrived. After being sworn in on the morning of the 8th, Shang Zhen specially hosted a banquet in the Great Hall of the Provincial Government for the new and former provincial committee members and National Government representative Hu Xianglin.

<h3>President Wang's Condition Gradually Improving; No Need for Surgical Treatment Currently; However, Full Rest is Required After Recovery</h3>
<p>President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Foreign Affairs Wang Jingwei has been in Shanghai for treatment for more than a week since his old illness relapsed. Before arriving in Shanghai, Wang's condition was quite serious. After undergoing an examination at the Noehr Hospital, Dr. Noehr and other doctors agreed that surgery would be necessary if needed, but because the surgery would take more than two hours to complete, Wang's body could not withstand it. Therefore, they tried their best to avoid surgery. Fortunately, after days of treatment, the condition has improved and there has been a turn for the better. If there are no changes in the future, it can be stabilized by injection and there is no need for surgery. However, after Wang's condition improves, it will not be easy to recover without sufficient rest time. Therefore, it is not yet possible to predict when he will be discharged from the hospital.</p>

<h3>Chen Ce Leads the Haiqi and Haichen Warships; Expected to Arrive at Songkou Today; Will Report to Chen Shaokuan and Request Instructions</h3>
<p>The Central News Agency reports that the Haiqi and Haichen warships telegraphed to request to return to the fleet.

<h3>Rice Prices Rebound and Fall</h3>
<p>Due to the floods in various provinces in the Yangtze River basin, and the prolonged rains in the counties of southern Jiangsu Province, rice prices once rose sharply. Merchants from Hubei and Jiangxi also came to Shanghai to order large quantities of rice, so the price per stone rose to nearly 13 yuan in a few days. However, since the weather cleared up the day before yesterday, and there was news that the rainfall in the middle reaches of the Yangtze River had also stopped, and the counties north of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu Province, which had previously suffered from prolonged drought, had also received abundant rainfall, people's hearts became weak, and rice prices rebounded and fell. According to observations from grain merchants, although the middle reaches of the Yangtze River have suffered from floods this year, the rainfall in the counties of Jiangsu Province is still relatively even, and the harvest is not expected to be reduced. Even most of the farmland in the Zhejiang area has not been affected by the disaster. Therefore, rice prices are not expected to rise as wildly as last year. Moreover, in recent years, the government authorities have strongly promoted the food storage business, so if the floodwaters in the middle reaches can recede in time, there will be no panic in terms of people's food supply.</p>

He has lived in China for five years and is very familiar with the situation in China. He is currently coming to China from the Dutch Embassy in Germany.

<h3>Ministry of Finance Yesterday Instructed Ningbo Shiye Bank to Handle Liquidation Within a Deadline</h3>
<p>Ningbo Shiye Bank declared its suspension of business on the 4th of last month. More than a month has passed since then, but there has been no news of resumption of business or liquidation measures.

The document was handed over to Mr. Luo Zongmeng, the liquidation supervisor of the Ministry of Finance, to be forwarded. The original text reads as follows: "In order to comply with the instructions, it is found that the bank has been suspended for nearly a month. It has neither convened a temporary shareholders' meeting to make a resolution in accordance with the law, nor has it elected liquidators to be responsible for liquidation. Prolonging the matter in this way not only hinders the interests of the creditors but also violates the law, which is extremely inappropriate. Now, according to the request for instructions submitted to the Ministry by Mr. Luo Zongmeng, the supervisor and liquidation commissioner of the bank, you are hereby ordered to select liquidators within ten days from the date of receipt of this document to engage in liquidation. If no liquidators are selected by the deadline, the bank's directors will be designated as liquidators to handle the liquidation matters, so as to conclude the matter as soon as possible. In addition, the bank also operates savings business. In accordance with the Savings Bank Law and the approved articles of association of the bank's savings department, directors, supervisors, managers, etc. shall bear joint and several liability for repayment. The regulations are strict and should be strictly enforced. You must quickly comply with the Ministry's previous orders and repay savings deposits and other debts within the prescribed time limit. If you continue to evade or delay, the Ministry will definitely arrest you according to law and investigate the matter without any leniency. This is the order." It is learned that Mr. Zongmeng, the supervisor and liquidation commissioner sent by the Ministry to Ningbo Shiye Bank, is investigating the bank's assets and liabilities in detail to clarify the situation of liquidation. It is reported that Mr. Luo has already been proceeding with this after receiving the order.</p>

<h3>Chamber of Commerce Telegrams the Ministry of Finance, etc. Requesting the Cancellation of the Pig Business Tax</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce telegraphed the Ministry of Finance and the Jiangsu Provincial Government, stating: (abridged titles) On the 9th of this month, according to the letter from the Fresh Pig Vending Industry Association, "We have received letters from Xu Fuxing and other nine pig firms in Tong and Ru counties, as well as representatives of the fresh pig vending industry, such as Cong Jiamo, stating that since November of the 21st year of the Republic of China, our pig merchants have suffered from the Jiangbei Pig Business Tax, which is a disguised form of Likin tax. Checkpoints are set up along the river to stop ships and inspect cabins, and exorbitant taxes are levied. The industry has appealed to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance to order the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate and abolish it. Representatives were also sent to Beijing and the province to petition. On November 31st, the Executive Yuan issued Order No. 226, which ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Government to investigate and abolish it. The Ministry of Finance also issued Order No. 2752, which stated that the pig business tax in Jiangsu Province should be collected at a rate of 0.5% according to the precedent of the Shanxi trade associations in Anhui Province, and should not be collected based on the number of pigs. Counting cabins for assessment is inappropriate. The Jiangsu Provincial Finance Department should be ordered to rectify the matter by a deadline. Subsequently, the Finance Department collected 1% as a temporary short-term measure. The merchants and others have patriotic enthusiasm and are concerned about the emptiness of the national treasury. They sighed with emotion and勉力 burden,聊補 the national crisis in one in ten thousand. In May of this year, Chen Guo contracted the pig business tax, recklessly disregarding the merchants' difficulties. He used Naxi蠢冒助唐, as the director of the Tongru business tax. Inland sub-cards were added, such as Dingyan, Matang, Zipu, Maqiao, etc. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce previously submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to abolish the cards. It is on record that the director in charge dared to privately establish these cards at locations that had been abolished by explicit order, and levied taxes on passing ships, intensifying the situation. Each pig was taxed at a rate of over 1.6% to 1.8%, which violated the law and was more poisonous than Likin. Furthermore, the staff used were all local thugs, and some villains, such as Mao Jinzhang, detained ships and caused difficulties, acting as accomplices. The merchants are on the verge of bankruptcy in the countryside and are suffering from this cruel and harsh tax. How can people's lives be secured? Therefore, we specially report the situation to your association and ask for your assistance in forwarding it to the competent authorities. The inland sub-cards should be abolished, and the original plan should be followed. The special commissioner Chen Guo and the director of the Tongru pig tax, Mao Zhutang, should be dismissed and punished by a deadline, and virtuous officials should be dispatched to replace them to relieve the difficulties and save the people's livelihood." In response, it was found that the pig business tax was previously submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and was handled in accordance with the precedent of the Shanxi trade associations in Anhui Province. That is, each business's total amount, such as vendors and cured meat businesses, etc., would pay business tax at a rate of 0.5%, and should not be assessed based on the number of ships counted. This was clearly stipulated. Later, the Jiangsu Finance Department changed the pig business tax to a temporary measure and increased the tax rate to 1%, which doubled the burden on merchants and civilians and caused great distress. Now, the business tax commissioner Chen Guo and the director Mao Zhutang are only interested in profit and disregard the merchants' difficulties. They have set up checkpoints along the way at locations where the tax cards were abolished by order of the Executive Yuan, and they collect heavy taxes on passing ships, counting cabins for assessment, and the tax rate has exceeded 1.6% to 1.8%. Such harsh and tyrannical taxation is against the law and oppresses the merchants. We sincerely request your association to assist us and forward this to the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Finance, the Jiangsu Provincial Government, and the Jiangsu Provincial Donation and Tax Supervision Committee for thorough investigation according to law. Able officials should be selected to take over and follow the method of collecting business tax at the National Finance Conference, strengthen reforms, and eliminate long-standing malpractices to reduce the burden and relieve the merchants' difficulties. After investigation, the Chamber of Commerce expresses its gratitude. According to the Business Tax Law deliberated by the Legislative Yuan and promulgated by the National Government, Article 7 states that short-term businesses may, mutatis mutandis, follow the provisions of Articles 3 to 6 and collect taxes on a monthly basis. The difference between the short-term business tax and the ordinary business tax is only that the payment deadline is changed from quarterly to monthly. There is no change in other collection methods. Setting up checkpoints to intercept and count by number is an abolished practice of Likin and is by no means permitted by the Business Tax Law. As for soliciting merchants for contracting, it is strictly prohibited by Article 7 of the Business Tax Law. The matter concerns the national laws and regulations and cannot be allowed to be changed at will. Even according to the Ministry's instructions cited by the association, it is limited to collection by trade associations and absolutely not allowed to count cabins for assessment and collect taxes based on the number of pigs. Therefore, Chen Guo's contracting of the pig tax and setting up checkpoints along the way in Dingyan, Matang, and other places not only violates national law but also goes against the Ministry's orders. Moreover, the tax rate is set at 1%, but the actual collection is 1.6% or 1.8%, which involves the issue of excess fees. How can merchants bear such unexpected exploitation? Based on the previous situation in the letter, we should telegraph the Ministry (Government) for consideration and approval to maintain the plan of collection by trade associations, withdraw the contracted merchants, and cancel the checkpoints along the way to comply with laws and regulations and avoid harshness. This is for the public good. Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce."</p>

<p>The Egg Product Subcommittee of the Commodity Inspection Technology Research Committee held its third day of meetings on the morning of the 10th in the conference room of the Shanghai Commodity Inspection Bureau. Representatives from various commodity inspection bureaus arrived on time to participate in the meeting. The meeting was still chaired by Liu Dongye, the standing committee member of the group, to discuss the chemical inspection part of the draft unified inspection method for egg products. The content of this part is more complex, and there are often differences in opinions among the parties, so the discussion took a lot of time.

<h3>Zhengyi Gu Yuan's Famous Lotus Pond Will Soon Open Planting Thousand-Petaled White Lotus Adds to the Charm</h3>
<p>Gu Yuan's lotus pond at Zhengyi Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway is planted with famous Indian species, and the flower crowns are double-flowered, which is extremely unique and surpasses ordinary flowers. In recent years, it has been well-known and attracts the attention of people from all over the world. This situation has been reported in this newspaper. However, the facilities there are very simple, with only one pavilion and one pond. Visitors, in addition to admiring the famous flowers, have little to linger on. It is now heard that the Gu Yuan Relics Preservation Committee has paid attention to this point and has built a new pond to the east of the pond this spring, adding a thousand-petaled lotus species to supply visitors' enjoyment. This flower is shaped like a peony, and the color is white as snow, which is rare in other places. It will soon be the time of flowering, and from now on, it will compete with the double lotus, red and white, and the groups will compete for beauty and complement each other. For the convenience of lotus-viewing tourists, the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou-Ningbo Railway Administration has decided to specially stop the 22nd express train from Shanghai to Beijing for one minute at Zhengyi Station from July 15th to August 14th. The bureau has also compiled a handbook for admiring the double lotus, which is being printed and is specially available for lotus-viewing tourists.</p>

<h3>Literacy Education Committee Promotes Literacy Education for Laborers Stipulates Guidelines for Establishing Labor Literacy Schools by Various Manufacturers Investigation Has Now Begun Deadline for Classes to Begin by the End of August</h3>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reported that since the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee began implementing literacy education on the 1st of this month, all 220 municipal literacy schools have been in session for more than a week. The committee sent Mei Changjia, Li Can, Huang Yaohua, and others to inspect the schools. The situation is quite good, and the public is very enthusiastic about enrolling. However, the languages of the students vary, especially in the Hongkou districts where most of the people are of Cantonese origin, so teaching is a bit difficult. There are no other problems. It is expected that the results will be good. In order to promote literacy education for laborers, the committee has stipulated guidelines for establishing labor literacy schools by various factories, companies, and stores. The investigation has now begun, and all factories must start by the end of August. The guidelines for establishing labor literacy schools are as follows:</p>
<p>Literacy Survey</p>
<p>1.  Literacy Survey: All factories, companies, stores, etc. in this city should conduct their own surveys of literate and illiterate workers (including employees). The method is as follows: (1) If there are graduates from public schools or other equivalent schools, they should be sent to the district office of the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee. After the office verifies that they are indeed graduates, they will be considered literate workers and exempt from literacy education. (2) If they recognize the 600 characters stipulated by the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee, a list of such workers should be sent to the district office of the Shanghai Literacy Education Committee. After passing a periodic examination, they will also be considered literate workers and exempt from literacy education. (3) Workers other than those in items (1) and (2) are considered illiterate workers and should receive literacy education.</p>
<p>Establishing Schools</p>
<p>2.  Establishing Schools: If there are 30 or more workers in a factory, company, store, etc. who should receive literacy education, at least one labor literacy school must be established. 3. School Name: The name of the labor literacy school shall be "Shanghai XX Factory, Company, Store Labor Literacy School." If there are two or more labor literacy schools in the same factory, etc., the words "First," "Second," etc. may be added after the name of the factory, etc. to distinguish them. 4. Number of People per Batch: The standard number of people per batch in a labor literacy school is 50. Male and female workers should be taught in separate classes in principle. 5. Number of Classes to be Operated: The number of classes in a labor literacy school shall be determined by the factory, company, store, etc. according to the number of illiterate workers and the economic situation, but at least one class must be established before August 31, 1935. Before June 31, 1936, literacy education for all workers who should receive literacy education must be completed.</p>
<p>Teaching Time</p>
<p>6.  Teaching Time: The standard teaching time for each class in a labor literacy school is one hour per day. If there are special circumstances, it may be increased or decreased with the approval of the district office of the Municipal Literacy Education Committee. The teaching time shall be determined according to the convenience of the students. Morning, evening, and daytime are all possible. However, once it is stipulated, it shall not be changed freely. 7. Study Period: The study period for a labor literacy school is generally two months. If there are special circumstances, the study period may be shortened or extended with the approval of the district office of the Municipal Literacy Education Committee. 8. School Address: The school address of a labor literacy school should be in the factory, company, store, etc., if possible. Otherwise, nearby nunneries, shrines, offices, residences, and schools may be borrowed and attached.</p>
<p>School Equipment</p>
<p>9.  School Equipment: The scale of the labor literacy school may be simple. Ordinary desks, stools, furniture, etc. can be used.

<h3>The Municipal Chamber of Commerce Sends Another Letter to the Four County Governments Requesting Unified Cotton Bale Weight</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce sent a letter to the governments of the four counties of Fengxian, Songjiang, Jinshan, and Nanhui, stating: "To the esteemed governments: On the 9th of this month, we received a letter from the Shanghai Cotton Ginning Industry Association stating that the members of our factories suffer losses every year due to the different weights of the gunny bags in various places when receiving inland cotton. Last year, we discussed measures to ban heavy gunny bags and sent a letter to your association to forward to the county governments in the cotton-producing areas, indicating to the merchants to buy and sell accordingly. Later, it gradually became more uniform. Now that the autumn harvest is approaching, and new bags are in urgent need of compilation and sale, we are deeply afraid that the old malpractices will re-emerge after a long time. Therefore, we discussed the resolution again and sent a letter to your association to quickly forward it again to the relevant county governments in the bag-producing areas of Songjiang, Jinshan, Fengxian, and Nanhui, issuing a notice to reiterate the ban to ensure uniformity. The proposed measures to ban gunny bag weight are as follows: The weight of the gunny bag shall still be in accordance with the old plan, with each bag weighing 1 catty and 4 taels of the market scale, and each pair weighing 2 catties and 8 taels as the standard. If the standard is exceeded, deduct the excess amount for each pair up to 3 catties of the market scale. If the excess exceeds 3 catties of the market scale per pair, the bag opening shall be cut off. If there is any disobedience, severe penalties shall be imposed." Accordingly, it was found that the weight of the gunny bag for wrapping cotton, stipulated to be 1 catty and 4 taels of the market scale per bag, was previously submitted to the association by the industry association in July of last year, and we sent a letter to the governments of the counties in the gunny bag-producing areas, requesting them to issue a notice. Later, we received replies from your (Songjiang, Fengxian) county governments, approving the handling accordingly, and the notice was issued banning it. Now that the cotton market is approaching, we have to reiterate the importance of gunny bag weight to ensure uniformity. The proposed measures to ban it are also fair and reasonable. In addition to sending a letter according to the situation, we hereby send a letter for your consideration. We hope that your government will investigate according to the established case and the proposed measures to ban it this time, and issue a notice to inform everyone to avoid the malpractices of unevenness, to strengthen public friendship."</p>

<h3>Eurasia Aviation Corporation to Increase Flight Frequencies on Two Routes, Aircraft No. 1 Currently Under Repair</h3>
<p>The Guowen News Agency reports that the Eurasia Aviation Corporation's Shanghai-Xinjiang route, Western Section (Xi'an to Lanzhou), and Ningxia-Baotou route have experienced unusually high passenger and cargo volumes in recent months. The company's current schedule of one round trip per week is insufficient to meet demand. It plans to increase the frequency of flights on these two routes in the near future to facilitate transportation. The increased frequency and timing are currently being planned. As for Aircraft No. 1, which was forced to land in Haiyuan on the 4th of this month, the company has not yet received a detailed report on the extent of the damage. It has instructed the Xi'an station chief to dispatch personnel to provide care and assist in repairs. Since Haiyuan lacks road access, the transportation of all repair equipment and fuel is extremely difficult. It is currently impossible to predict when it will be able to fly back to Xi'an, and it will depend on the progress of the repairs.</p>

We are enclosing it for your review as a reference. However, there are many categories of domestic goods, and it is impossible to include all of them in the investigation. Omissions are inevitable. We also request that manufacturers collect the latest new products, as well as domestic goods that have not yet been promoted abroad. Our association will do its best to promote them on your behalf. We have also entrusted Mr. Wang Xingyao, Mr. Deng Qiyao, Mr. Hu Shicheng, Mr. Zhao Guide, and Mr. Wang Shuyang as honorary representatives of our association to assist your association from the sidelines.

<h3>Baoshan County Public Security Bureau Seizes Large Quantity of Tax-Evasive Artificial Silk, Totaling Ninety-One Pieces of Tianqiao Brand Artificial Silk, Imported from Liuhou via Jiading and then Transported to Shanghai, Baoshan County Government Sends Telegram to Provincial Government for Instructions</h3>
<p>The Xinsheng News Agency reports that the Luodian Public Security Bureau of Baoshan County recently received a tip-off stating that a large quantity of tax-evasive artificial silk would be smuggled in on ships imported from overseas, transferred to small lighters midway, landed near the mouth of the Liuhou River, and then transported to Jiading. From Jiading, it would be transported by car via the Shanghai-Taicang Road to Shanghai and various inland areas. Because the artificial silk had not been taxed, it would not be imported through Shanghai to avoid inspection and penalties by customs. After receiving the tip-off, Zhou Jintang, the Chief of the Public Security Bureau, immediately dispatched police to guard the key points of the Shanghai-Taicang Road to prevent the tax-evasive artificial silk from being transported to Shanghai. The police obeyed the order and kept watch all night, but did not see any cars coming. It was not until around 5:00 a.m. on the 6th that a brown Chevrolet car drove straight from north to south. The black license plate issued by the municipal government was No. 9569, and the license plate issued by the concession was No. 11041. The police immediately ordered the car to stop for inspection. In the car compartment, they saw stacked packages totaling ninety-one pieces, which were identified as No. 120 Tianqiao brand artificial silk after unpacking. There was one driver and one female escort in the car. A highway pass for five provinces, two driver's licenses, one concession license, and one invoice from the Yiji Company of Daigou Bridge in Shanghai were seized from the driver and the female escort. The invoice stated "Goods to be picked up in Jiading." The police immediately took the driver and the escort to the Public Security Bureau for questioning. According to the driver, his name is Xiang Zhongshi, from Nantong, 38 years old, residing at No. 58 Daode Lane, Fuxi Road, Shanghai. He did not know what was in the packages. His master, Tang She, ordered him to drive the car to Jiading to pick up passengers on the evening of the 5th. Later, a friend of the master, Mr. Wang, moved the packages from a rickshaw to the car and ordered him to drive to Shanghai. The female escort said her name was Chen Sanlin, from Nantong, 28 years old, and lived at the same address as Xiang Zhongshi. She only obeyed the orders of her master, Tang She, to go to Jiading, and provided evasive answers to other questions. The Chief of the Public Security Bureau considered the matter to be of great importance and sent the artificial silk, the car, and the two people to the county government for investigation. After hearing the report, the County Magistrate Long Tiyao considered the matter to be related to tax evasion, which would harm national income, and specially telegraphed the provincial government and the Department of Civil Affairs for instructions.</p>
<h3>Bar Association's New and Old Staff Members Exchanged Duties Yesterday</h3>

<h3>Tobacco and Exchange Industry Sends Letter Requesting Cancellation of Increased Donation, Yesterday Sent Letter to Chinese Taxpayers' Association, Requesting Efforts to Argue with the French Municipal Council</h3>
<p>The First Special District Office of the Shanghai Tobacco and Exchange Industry Association recently reported that the French Concession Municipal Council had increased the tobacco and exchange donations from two yuan and eight jiao to five yuan and six jiao. Six companies, including Yingchang, Henghexing, Guangda, Qianruihe, Ruitai, and Ruidayong, have been forced to pay the increased amount. The office believes that at a time when the market is depressed, the sudden increase in donations is unbearable and requests assistance. The office, based on the situation, sent a letter to the Chinese Taxpayers' Association, requesting that it appeal to the French Municipal Council to exempt the increase in order to maintain commerce. The original letter stated, "Regarding the letter from the Second Special District Office of our association, stating that members Qianruihe, Ruitai, and Ruidayong on Yongan Street, and Henghexing, Yingchang, and Guangda on Laobeimen Street, have claimed that they have been operating tobacco and exchange businesses for many years and have been donating to the French Municipal Council for tobacco and exchange licenses, paying two yuan and eight jiao per month. However, starting in June of this year, the council sent people to the stores to urge payment, requiring double the amount of five yuan and six jiao. If they do not pay, they will be punished. Under this threat, they were forced to pay. Our stores are single-front stores with small businesses and cannot bear this heavy burden in this declining era. The peers in various roads in this district, similar to our stores, do not have such a large license fee, and even those with larger businesses only pay five yuan and six jiao. It can be seen that the authorities' treatment is unfair. We are specially sending this letter to clarify, and we urge your association to uphold justice and quickly argue with the French Municipal Council to request correction and continue to collect the original amount from July onwards to show consideration and lighten the burden. Based on this, we are sending a corresponding letter for your attention, and we hope that your chairman will investigate and, as requested, quickly forward the letter to the French Municipal Council, considering that the market is currently depressed and businesses are declining. Can the increase be exempted and the original payment be made to help businesses in difficulty and maintain operations? We are extremely grateful."</p>

<h3>Leprosy Sanatorium to be Completed Soon, Letter Sent to Request Donation from Hu Wenhu</h3>
<p>The China Leprosy Relief Association at No. 131, Museum Road, Shanghai, previously recognized the large number of leprosy patients in Shanghai and the rapid and widespread transmission, and decided to establish a sanatorium for treatment and relief. It found a base of more than ten acres near Dachang, designed by architect Fan Wenzhao and constructed by Sheng Yunji Construction Company, building more than twenty bungalows at a cost of 100,000 yuan. It organized a fundraising team to collect donations from all walks of life, but the total amount obtained was only more than 60,000 yuan, which was far from enough. Later, Hu Wenhu, a wealthy overseas Chinese merchant from Nanyang, returned to the country for sightseeing, visited the site, and promised to donate several houses independently, about 40,000 yuan, but only half could be paid after most of the houses were completed, and the rest would be paid after all were completed. The construction of the sanatorium began on May 11th of this year, and a part has been completed, and it is expected to be fully completed by the end of next month. According to Hu's opinion, it seems possible to request the allocation of half of the donation to meet urgent needs. Therefore, the association recently sent a letter to Hu in Singapore to report the matter, but has not yet received a reply.</p>

<h3>Members of Telephone Expert Committee Largely Decided, Chinese Hu Junruixiang Hired, Bylaws in Principle Approved</h3>
<p>The Public Concession Municipal Council, due to the Shanghai Telephone Company's request to adopt a per-call charging system and increase telephone charges, had previously decided to organize a special committee on telephone issues in accordance with the resolution passed by the Western ratepayers' annual meeting to discuss whether the company's request was feasible. It also decided to hire British telephone expert Mr. Brown to assist in the investigation. Later, at the request of various parties, in addition to Mr. Brown, several experts from other countries were hired to handle the investigation together. This matter has been brewing for a long time, and recently the board of directors of the Municipal Council decided to stop the organization of the special committee on telephone issues and establish a separate expert committee, hiring several telephone experts from various countries to jointly be responsible for handling the matter. The already-decided candidates for the experts from various countries, as well as their brief biographies, are listed below:</p>
<p>(1) Major II. Brown, British, currently the Deputy Chief Engineer of the British Post Office General Administration, will retire soon. (2) Dr. Inada, Japanese, former Director of the Machinery and Works Bureau of the Japanese Ministry of Transportation, currently a professor at Waseda University. (3) Mr. Hu Ruixiang, Chinese, former Director of the Nanjing Telephone Bureau of the Ministry of Transportation of the National Government, Chief Engineer of the Zhejiang Provincial Telephone Bureau, currently the Director of the Nine-Province Long-Distance Telephone Engineering Office. (4) One expert from the United States, the candidate has not yet been decided and is currently being sought for agreement, and will be announced in the next few days. Regarding the bylaws of the aforementioned expert committee, they have now been approved in principle by the board of directors of the Municipal Council. However, the Shanghai Telephone Company has stated that the three points that were previously agreed upon and still need to be discussed further by both the Municipal Council and the company, namely the depreciation of the company's assets, the US government's income tax, and the head office's management fees, are not within the scope of this expert investigation. The bylaws consist of three articles, which are specifically described below: (1) Whether the Shanghai Telephone Company is entitled to increase telephone charges from April 1st of this year in accordance with the franchise contract, and whether the company's expenses for machinery, equipment, and other operating activities are economical and reasonable. After the experts appointed by the Municipal Council have investigated these points in detail, they will prepare a report and submit it to the board of directors. (2) Whether it is appropriate to change business telephones or residential telephones, or both, to a per-call charging system, and if so, how should the prices of each item be determined so that the company can comply with the various points in the franchise contract. The experts will prepare a report and price list and submit them to the board of directors. (3) If the existing per-set charging system is not changed, how should the telephone charges be increased in accordance with the franchise contract, and how should the (A) business telephone, (B) residential telephone, and (C) other price items be increased in moderation so that the company can earn profits on its operating investment. The experts will consider this in detail, prepare a report, and submit it to the board of directors.</p>

<h3>Shi Jiaji's Wife Sues for Divorce: Recounts Suffering Abuse, Judge Urges Reconciliation</h3>
<p>Shi Jiaji, 34 years old, a native of Wuxing, Zhejiang, residing at 22 Meibaige Road, is the nephew and grandson of the current Ambassador to the United States, Shi Zhaoji, and philanthropist Shi Zhaozeng (also known as Shengzhi). He married Wang Liqing, a woman from Sichuan, on January 18th of the 17th year of the Republic [1928]. Wang Liqing, now 33, comes from a distinguished family, being the daughter of the late Wang Bing'en (named Xuecen and Xiecheng), the former Guangdong Circuit Intendant of the Qing Dynasty. Since their marriage, eight years have passed. Initially, the couple enjoyed a harmonious relationship and had a son, now six years old. However, Shi Jiaji was afflicted by illness and eventually developed an addiction, leading to problems with Wang Liqing's living expenses. Furthermore, due to his post-illness condition, the couple could no longer cohabitate. Liqing was forced to live separately with her husband's sister-in-law for six years. Not only was she left without means of support, but she also suffered bullying. Fearing that her entire life's happiness would be ruined, Wang recently retained lawyers Shen Qichang and Zhu Zhizhong to file a lawsuit with the First Special Court's Civil Division, requesting a divorce from her husband, Shi Jiaji, and payment of alimony. Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, Judge Yu Changzi presided over the hearing in the Civil Division. The defendant did not appear. The lawyers appeared in court to defend, based on the plaintiff Shi Wang Liqing's testimony, stating, "I was born into a prominent family and have always been instructed in proper conduct. After formally marrying the defendant, Shi Jiaji, on January 18th of the Wuchen year [1928] at the Taihe Garden on Second Avenue in Shanghai, eight years have passed, and we have a six-year-old son. Initially, we were harmonious, but soon I suffered repeated abuse within the family. After my father passed away in the 18th year of the Republic [1929], and my mother passed away the following year, our family fortunes declined, and the situation in my husband's family deteriorated further. Because the defendant's illness persisted, I was forced to live separately with my husband's sister-in-law and have been separated from the defendant for six years. He has not provided for my living expenses, forcing me to borrow money to survive, which is unbearable. Furthermore, the defendant has become deeply addicted, abandoning me as if I were trash, and I have suffered all kinds of oppression and abuse within the family. Although I live in my husband's house, I am still subjected to bullying, making it almost impossible to live in peace. If this continues, how can I endure it? I have repeatedly requested to live with the defendant, but he ignores me. Failing that, I requested a separation with a defined amount for living expenses to enable me to survive, but he did not reply. Having no other recourse, I petitioned the court to mediate, but the defendant failed to appear, preventing mediation. Now, in addition to requesting a judgment for divorce, I also request payment of alimony. As I am currently 33 years old, and considering that I will live to 60, there are still 27 years remaining. Calculating at a rate of 150 yuan per month, the annual amount is 1,800 yuan, totaling 48,600 yuan. In addition, there is 10,000 yuan for the child's education until adulthood, and my jewelry and other items of dowry, which were gradually taken away by the defendant, are estimated to be worth over 8,000 yuan, plus 1,000 yuan for my dowry money. I request that the court order the defendant to repay these amounts. Furthermore, as my parents have both passed away many years ago and my family is impoverished, I am unable to pay the court fees. Therefore, I request to be granted litigation relief." Subsequently, the defendant's defense lawyer rose to request that all the points requested by the plaintiff be rejected, and denied that the defendant had engaged in abuse. He stated that the defendant is currently employed at the Zhejiang Industrial Bank with a monthly salary of over 20 yuan. Previously, he was often ill and unable to work, but he provided the plaintiff with food, clothing, and shelter, and a monthly allowance of 30 yuan, of which 15 yuan was drawn by the plaintiff monthly with a stamp from the Yongheng Bank on Ningbo Road, and the remaining 15 yuan was subsidized by the defendant's brother. Therefore, the defendant is unable to pay the amount requested by the plaintiff and should be rejected. Judge Yu, after reviewing the situation, advised both parties to attempt reconciliation and told the plaintiff that if the defendant continues to pay 30 yuan per month, she could cohabitate. The plaintiff indicated that she needed to further increase the amount. Judge Yu then adjourned the case for a later hearing, instructing them to attempt reconciliation. If reconciliation fails, the defendant must appear in court so that his smoking habits can be investigated.</p>
<h3>Robbery on Yuelai Street in Nanshi: Three Police Officers Shot, Sirens Sound, Officers Wounded in Succession, Two Burly Robbers Flee Without a Trace, Shop Assistant of Incense Store Robbed of 400 Yuan</h3>
<p>Yesterday morning at nine o'clock, a robbery occurred on Yuelai Street in Nanshi, where the robbers shot and injured three police officers. The details are as follows: Chen Bosheng, a shop assistant from the Datongsheng Incense and Candle Store on North Zhejiang Road in the Public Concession, was dispatched by the manager yesterday morning at nine o'clock to take a check for 800 yuan to the Detaixin Money Exchange on Youche Street outside Dadongmen in Nanshi. He also took out 400 yuan in cash from the money exchange. While heading north, two robbers noticed and followed Chen.</p>
<p>When Chen passed the Mao Yuyuan Candle Store at the entrance of Wujia Lane on Yuelai Street, the two robbers approached, brandished guns, and ordered him to remain silent, seizing the 400 yuan Chen was carrying. After obtaining the stolen money, they fled south in different directions. Chen shouted for help while chasing after them. One robber ran south along Zixia Road. Upon hearing the alarm, police officer Liu Junshan (36 years old, from Hebei) from post number 14 took off his rifle. Just as he was about to load bullets, the robber was already upon him. The robber, acting preemptively,</p>
<p>fired, and the bullet penetrated Liu's body, causing him to fall to the ground. Bystanders, fearing being caught in the crossfire, scrambled to hide. The robber then escaped calmly. Another robber headed south from Miezhu Street and turned into Chenghangtou Street. Police officer Chen Yilong (20 years old, from Henan) from post number 15 also heard the alarm and pursued the sound. He saw a robber running south and caught up to him, grabbing hold. Unexpectedly, in the confusion, the robber fired a shot at Chen, hitting his right wrist, and the bullet lodged in his arm.</p>
<p>The bullet did not penetrate. After being wounded, Chen stubbornly refused to let go. In desperation, the robber fired three more shots, hitting Chen's left and right legs. At this point, Chen collapsed, and the robber escaped. (Note: The robbery occurred within the jurisdiction of the Shiliupu Sub-Bureau, while the officers' posts are under the jurisdiction of the Xundaodajie Police Station.) When the incident occurred, Jin Dianyang, the head of the Xundaodajie Police Station, immediately led inspectors Chen Xueqi and Xu Fenghan, along with sergeants Wang Zuoxian, Zhang Suhou, Liu Maolin, and Li Shengzu, and officers Zhang Wenquan and Zhao Shuyan, all fully armed, in various directions to</p>
<p>pursue the robbers. However, the two robbers had already disappeared without a trace. Chief Jin immediately ordered the injured officer Liu Junshan to be rushed to the Nanyang Hospital at Xiaodongmen. Officer Liu was incoherent due to the severity of his injuries. Doctors discovered that the bullet was lodged in his left abdomen. After several examinations using X-rays, they found the bullet in his left lower back. It was not until about one o'clock in the afternoon that they managed to remove the bullet. However, the injury was in a vital area of the waist and ribs.</p>
<p>The prognosis is uncertain. The injured officer Chen Yilong was transported by vehicle to the Shanghai Hospital on Duojia Road, Sandaimeitou, for treatment. Doctors discovered that the bullet in Chen's right arm had also not penetrated and removed it. The bullet wounds in his left and right legs, where his pants were torn in four places, were not serious. A stray bullet hit rickshaw puller Ji Fuying (27 years old, from Hai'an) in the cheek. He was also sent to Shanghai Hospital for treatment. Doctors bandaged the wound, and he was soon discharged. The victim, Chen Boshengshan, was taken by police to the Shiliupu Sub-Bureau. After questioning by Director Huang Junfu, he was instructed to leave and await further notice.</p>
<p>The two robbers were both around 30 years old, of robust build. One wore a dark-colored Xiangyunsha short shirt and pants, and the other wore a dark-colored foreign gauze short shirt and pants. Officer Liu Junshan has served at the station for four years. He is diligent in his duties. He is a native of Hebei and has an elderly mother, wife, and three children, the oldest being only seven years old and the youngest still in infancy. Officer Chen Yilong has been on duty for over a year, a native of Henan, whose parents are still alive. Chief Jin has reported the situation to Director Cai of the Public Safety Bureau for instructions.</p>
<h3>A Battle of Women Erupts in a Hangzhou Restaurant Wedding, An Elderly Woman Leads a Group of Women to Disrupt a Ceremony, the Couple is Humiliated and Unsure if They Should Laugh or Cry as They Proceed with the Wedding, a Comedic Scene of Cheng Jufu Marrying His Wife's Niece</h3>
<p>At 3:30 PM yesterday at the Hangzhou Restaurant, located at 730 Avenue Edward VII, an incident occurred where the wife's mother and her niece, fueled by jealousy, led a group of women to disrupt a wedding ceremony. The situation was extraordinarily bizarre. The details are as follows:</p>
<p>An Old Connection</p>
<p>A man named Cheng Jufu, also known as Zhiliang, 28 years old, currently serves as the secretary of the Shanghai Opera Research Association and the director of academic affairs at the First Private Vocational School. He resides at 80 Hengmao Lane, Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession. His origin is unknown. Supposedly he is from the Suzhou area. He was raised and educated in the Shanghai Orphanage, because he was orphaned at a young age. He was known to be intelligent, achieving top grades. There was a man named Ding Jinlin who lived at 102 Zhangjiabang, Pudong. He had only four daughters. The eldest, named Ada, was married to Zhang Fuquan, a boatman from Pudong. The second daughter, named Aer, was married to Zhao Zhongkui, a businessman from Huzhou who traded flour at the flour exchange. The third daughter, named Sannan, was married to Tang Changgeng, a foreman who worked in the packing industry in Pudong. Only the fourth daughter, Xiaomei, was not yet married. The Dings, wishing to enjoy their later years and continue their lineage, decided to adopt a son from the orphanage and marry him to Xiaomei to continue the Ding family line.</p>
<p>Subsequently, Divorce</p>
<p>After seeing that Cheng Jufu was intelligent and excellent in academics, they decided to adopt him from the orphanage on September 21st of the 16th year of the Republic [1927] to be their adopted son. For the sake of their fourth daughter, Xiaomei, they asked Zhang Junlian, who lived at 9 Huaxing Lane, West Cang Bridge in the city, and Wu Zhang, Ding's sister-in-law, to be matchmakers, and held a wedding, taking Cheng as their son-in-law. Cheng Jufu was satisfied with this unexpected turn of events, and the relationship between the couple was quite harmonious. However, Cheng regretted not having a profession. He consulted with the Dings about coming to Shanghai to find work, but opportunities were difficult to come by, and he was unsuccessful. He resided in Pudong for a long time. Four years ago, it was said that he had a son, but he soon died. Cheng himself also had health issues. For several years, he wanted to find employment, but he was only able to recover this April. It is said that Cheng divorced Xiaomei at that time.</p>
<p>Marries Niece</p>
<p>Zhao Zhongkui lives at 21 Nianshun Lane, Shaonian Road, Nanshi. After marrying Ding's second daughter, he had a daughter named Juxian, also known as Peilan, who is now around 20 years old. She is beautiful and behaves gracefully, resembling a lady from a prominent family. Cheng and Zhao, because they are related through marriage, often visited each other. After Cheng Jufu came to Shanghai to work this April, the visits became more frequent. He often went out to see movies with Zhao's wife and his niece Peilan. Unexpectedly, Cheng and Peilan fell in love, and their affection reached an extreme. After discussing it, they decided to hold their wedding at 4 PM on July 10th (yesterday) in the hall on the second floor of the Hangzhou Restaurant. They sent out invitations in advance, decorated the new house, and were very excited. They also asked the well-known person Yuan Ludeng to be their witness, and important figures from Shanghai sent congratulatory messages. The wedding hall was decorated luxuriously, and the hall was filled with guests offering their congratulations.</p>
<p>Wedding Hall Becomes a Battlefield</p>
<p>Who knew that before the good deed could be completed, disaster would strike? Around 3:30 PM yesterday, when the order of the ceremony was being arranged in the hall, a middle-aged man wearing a white straw hat suddenly rushed upstairs. He entered the hall claiming to be looking for Cheng Zhiliang to speak with. He was followed by dozens of middle-aged women, who were in a threatening mood and loudly demanded Cheng pay his debts. Cheng Jufu, realizing that things were going wrong, tried to escape. The relatives who had come to offer congratulations, fearing a disturbance, tried to persuade the women to stop. But the group of women refused to give up and demanded that Cheng pay immediately. While the commotion was happening, Ding Xiaomei arrived late. Seeing that the people could not agree, she shouted loudly and started to act. The wedding hall became a battlefield. Glass cups, flower baskets, and congratulatory banners flew around. The sounds of shattered dishes became the overture of the wedding ceremony. The women fought with abandon, not caring that their hair was disheveled, their clothes were torn, and they were drenched in sweat. Only the bride, Zhao Peilan, suffered, shrinking in fear.</p>
<p>Taken to the Police Station</p>
<p>Those present were unable to stop them. Fortunately, one of Cheng's friends seized the opportunity to slip out, fearing a great disaster, and used the phone to report to the police station for assistance. The police station dispatched a large number of detectives and patrol cars to suppress the commotion. A group of women were still engaged in a large display of their skills, and it was difficult to understand the truth due to the number of people and the noisy atmosphere. The police took the leading women, the groom Cheng Jufu, the bride Zhao Peilan, and Ding Xiaomei and Zhao Zhongkui to the police station. Under questioning, Ding Xiaomei's testimony was as described above. Cheng Jufu said that he was indeed married to Xiaomei, but later they divorced due to irreconcilable differences. He even posted advertisements in the Minbao and Xinwenbao newspapers declaring the divorce, which could be verified. Ding Xiaomei's actions were unreasonable and intended to damage his reputation and should be investigated.</p>
<p>Hastily Completes the Wedding</p>
<p>After reviewing the statements, the police station found that each party had their own version of events, and it would be necessary to present evidence to determine the truth. The relatives and friends who had come to offer congratulations saw that the situation had become a stalemate and dispersed. Only the band and a few of Cheng's friends remained in the wedding hall, sitting in the corners and discussing how to resolve the situation. They repaired the flower baskets and other items and returned them to their original positions. The reporter left the scene before a proper solution was found. A consensus was reached around six o'clock. Although the situation was clear, the auspicious day could not be missed. They signed a guarantee, requesting that the bride and groom be released on bail temporarily to get married. The police station also refused to accept Ding Xiaomei's complaint because she had no evidence. The bride and groom, unsure whether to laugh or cry, went to the Hangzhou Restaurant to complete the wedding and returned to their residence by car. It is unknown whether they will appear in court with Ding Xiaomei this morning. We will provide updates.</p>

Recently, the woman became involved with a bodyguard surnamed Shi, and abandoned Shi Jiliang. Shi, harboring resentment, thought of taking revenge. At 12:05 AM the other night, Shi hid a bottle of nitric acid and went to the woman's house. Seeing her and the bodyguard Shi sleeping intimately, Shi became enraged. He threw the acid into the house through the window, hitting the woman's arm. Shi then fled. The woman reported to the Yulin Road police station, who sent her to the hospital for treatment. Because the injuries were minor, Shi was discharged from the hospital. The police station ordered officer number 181 to arrest Shi. Shi initially denied the crime, but the police found traces of nitric acid on his pants. Shi then confessed. Yesterday morning, he was sent to the Fifth Criminal Court of the First Special Court. The police lawyer, Li Zhiyou, explained the case, prosecuting him under Article 277, Paragraph 3 of the Criminal Code. After Liu proved the circumstances of the throwing of the acid, Shi confessed that the woman had found another lover and abandoned him, and that she had invited thugs to beat him. He asked for leniency. Judge Dai Rongduo reviewed the confession and sentenced Shi Jiliang to two months of imprisonment as a warning.</p>

After the local bailiff Gu Xuepu reported to the Ximen branch of the Municipal Public Security Bureau, he also reported to the local court for an autopsy, which proved that the person had been assassinated and the corpse moved to the river.

<h3>Ye Zhongfang Ignores Alimony, Court Seizes Property</h3>
<p>Ye Shenfang, grandson of the late Ningbo gentleman Ye Chen'ai, nicknamed "Little Tremor", was sued by his wife Lu Yinglan in the Second Special Court for divorce and requested that he be ordered to pay alimony of 100,000 yuan. Ye repeatedly failed to appear, and the case was decided in absentia. The divorce was granted, and Ye was ordered to pay 60,000 yuan in alimony. Ye still avoided appearing. The Second Special Court requested the First Special Court to dispatch police to arrest Ye at 22, Lane 169, Carter Road, and transfer him to the enforcement court of the Second Special Court for interrogation. At the same time, the Shuntaixiang Western Clothing Store sued Ye for owing 1,416 yuan in clothing material wages. The Wu County Local Court ruled that the execution was ineffective and issued an execution certificate. Sun Liyan, the owner of the Shuntaixiang Store, extended lawyer Lin Yingqing to the case and requested to participate in the execution. It was ruled that a guarantee should be provided and ten days were allowed to raise money to pay off the debt. Ye was still imprisoned and refused to provide a guarantee. Yesterday, because the ten-day deadline had passed, at 12:00 AM, Judge Yang Ding of the Second Special Court interrogated Ye in the Sixth Court. Ye was brought to the court by a court clerk from the detention center. He was wearing a striped silk shirt and trousers, with glasses on his face, barefoot, and wearing leather slippers. Ye's lover, Lu Xiaomei, was also in court to listen. Officer Xun Ye confessed that he did not have a guarantor in prison, and there was no way to raise funds. He requested permission to go out to find a way to raise money. The two plaintiffs were represented by lawyers Dong Yu and Lin Yingqing, who both stated that the defendant was deliberately ignoring the court order and requested that the court instruct the First Special Court to seal up the property in the defendant's house at 22, Lane 169, Carter Road, and enforce the order. The officer issued a letter to the First Special Court approving the sealing up of the defendant's property, and instructed the plaintiff to investigate the defendant's property and report it to the court for enforcement. After the discussion, Ye was ordered to be returned to the detention center pending review.</p>

<h3>Concerning a Case of Murder Resulting from a Minor Matter of Not Sharpening Scissors: Rong Bangzheng Dies from Severe Injuries</h3>
<p>Li Guangtai, a native of Yangzhou and seventeen years old, was learning the barber trade at Gui Ji Barber Shop, No. 198 Route Tenant de la Tour, in the French Concession. Having completed his apprenticeship last year, he continued to work at the same shop as a junior employee. On the eighth of this month, Rong Bangzheng (age 26), a fellow townsman and guest barber at the shop, borrowed a pair of barber's scissors from Li. Upon returning them, he had not sharpened them. At half past midnight that evening, Rong, Li, and a child were in the attic, arguing over the minor issue of the borrowed scissors not being sharpened. The argument escalated into a physical altercation, with the two men grappling and wrestling. Li, being younger and weaker, was losing the fight. In desperation, he grabbed the scissors and stabbed Rong in the left side, penetrating about an inch. Blood gushed out like a fountain. Rong collapsed to the ground, injured. Fellow shop employees rushed Rong to Renji Hospital for treatment. After the doctor inquired about the cause of the injury, he provided medical attention and, as per protocol, reported the incident to the Central Police Station of the Public Concession, which then notified the French Concession police. Detective Yue Zhoubuguang and Bao Detective Shan Ronglin, among others, went to the scene and arrested the suspect, Li Guangtai. On the morning of the ninth, Li was escorted to the First Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, where Judge Sun Peng examined him. Attorney Fei Xizhen of the Police Department stated the case, briefly mentioning that the defendant was charged with attempted murder. The police had not yet completed their investigation, and the victim was still receiving treatment at the hospital. He requested a postponement and temporary detention of the defendant until the victim recovered and the investigation could be completed. The court reviewed the report and briefly questioned the defendant, then adjourned the hearing to the seventeenth of the month. The defendant was returned to custody. However, the victim's injuries, due to damage to the lungs, proved fatal despite medical treatment. He died in the hospital at half past midnight on the morning of the tenth. The hospital notified the French Concession police, who sent the body to the Tongren Fuyuan Branch Hall morgue yesterday morning. They then reported to the Second Special District Court, where Prosecutor Wang Ren, accompanied by forensic doctors and clerks, arrived at the morgue yesterday afternoon. After examining the body, they took their seats in court. Detective Zhang Chunsheng reported the investigation and the circumstances of the case. The defendant, Li Guangtai, was questioned by a mountain police officer, along with the defendant and witnesses Li Hu (the shop owner's wife), Chuan Xiaoma (a shop employee), and others, regarding the origins of the assault. The deceased's brother, Rong Bangyuan (age 28, a stocking weaver residing at No. 258 Fangxie Road), requested justice and claimed the body for coffining and burial. The official ruled that Rong Bangzheng died from the stab wound inflicted by Li Guangtai. The body was released to the family for burial, and the defendant was handed over to the Police Department for legal proceedings.</p>
<h3>The Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products Prepares for the National Exhibition in Xujiahui, Opening on the Twentieth of this Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Citizens' Association for Promoting National Products, located in Nine Acres, has been working hard to design and promote products made by its factory members. Due to the current state of economic depression in society, the sales volume of national products has been greatly affected, resulting in product backlog and significant difficulties. The 16th joint meeting of the 14th Executive and Supervisory Committee resolved that the Association, in order to expand the promotion of national products and alleviate overproduction, would participate in the Tianjin National Exhibition on September 8th and the six-county巡迴 National Exhibition in Wenzhou on November 1st, in accordance with the program outline. Furthermore, it will hold the Xujiahui National Exhibition three weeks earlier, starting on July 20th, to promote the sales of national products, regulate the finances of various factories, increase the strength of students' national product year and national product movement, and promote the efficiency of Shanghai West citizens in using national products. The cooperative department is responsible for the preparations, and Executive Committee member Chen Jusheng has been publicly recommended to consult with the French Concession leaders for their assistance and to jointly accomplish this grand event.</p>
<h3>First Special District Court Announcement: New Regulations of the Code of Civil Procedure</h3>
<p>The Jiangsu Shanghai First Special District Local Court issued an announcement yesterday, stating that Article 265 of the Code of Civil Procedure, which came into effect on July 1st of this year, stipulates: "Each party should record in writing their arguments and defenses used to prepare for oral arguments, as well as their statements and defenses against the other party's claims, and submit them to the court, which will then serve them to the other party." Paragraph 3 of Article 2474 of the same code states: "The matters for preparing oral arguments as stipulated in Article 265 should be recorded in the complaint (i.e., the initial complaint)." Article 266 of the same code stipulates that "The plaintiff's document for preparing oral arguments, in accordance with Paragraph 3 of Article 244, the defendant should submit a response before half of the trial preparation period has elapsed." However, upon reviewing the documents submitted by the parties to this court in civil litigation, many contain only a few words and do not legally record the arguments or defenses. Even if they are recorded in the documents, the opposing party often does not legally submit a response and only presents them during the court hearing, which not only violates the rules of litigation but also easily leads to delays. Hereafter, in civil litigation, the plaintiffs and defendants must record their arguments and defenses in detail in the documents when filing a lawsuit or response, and submit the evidence used, or copies or translations of the evidence, together to the court for review, so as to expedite the conclusion of the case and comply with the intention of the law. This announcement is hereby issued for general knowledge, and all parties and litigation agents are required to comply accordingly. This announcement is issued by Guo Yunguan, President of the Court.</p>
<h3>Changes to the Routes and Fares of the French-Owned Public Buses</h3>
<p>The French-owned public buses originally had two routes: Route 1 running between Waiyangjing Bridge and Fenglin Bridge, and Route 2 running between Waiyangjing Bridge and Wenlin Road. It is now learned that, starting from the eighth of this month (the other day), the company has revised the routes and fares of both routes as follows to facilitate passengers:</p>
<p>Route 1 only goes as far as Dapu Bridge. The entire route has been changed from eight fare stations to seven fare stations. The fare has been changed from 41 cents to 29 cents. From Songshan Road to Dapu Bridge, the first station is now 7 cents, with each subsequent station increasing by 3 or 4 cents.</p>
<p>Route 2's route from Waiyangjing Bridge has been extended to Xujiahui. It now runs west from the intersection of Avenue Albert and Avenue Haig, along Avenue Haig, Route Delastre, Route Frelupt, Route Testelin, Avenue Haig, Jiaotong University to Xujiahui. It then follows Route Petain east, turns onto Route Frelupt, and returns to the original route. From Tongfu Road to Xujiahui, the first station is 7 cents, with each subsequent station increasing by 3 or 4 cents. The total fare is 38 cents. Furthermore, although the Fenglin Bridge East Station on Route 1 has been cancelled, passengers who wish to travel from Waiyangjing Bridge to Fenglin Bridge can still take Route 2 to the intersection of Route Frelupt and Route Qizhi, with a fare that is 10 cents less than the original Route 1 fare.</p>
<h3>New Headquarters to be Established Soon for the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association</h3>
<p>According to the June report of the Public Works Department's Rickshaw Management Office, only 2,970 rickshaw pullers registered with the bureau on that day, which is considered a very small and disappointing number. In total, 34,995 rickshaw pullers have already registered. It is believed that the number of people in the city who make a living pulling rickshaws is definitely more than this. Therefore, in order to determine the exact number of rickshaw pullers, the bureau hopes that those who have not yet registered will come forward enthusiastically this month. Furthermore, since the resolution to reorganize the Rickshaw Pullers' Mutual Aid Association, the work of various departments has been actively progressing. However, the newly drafted regulations will not be formally approved by the board of directors until mid-August. The newly elected officials will also have to wait until the outgoing board of directors has prepared and submitted the accounts. The fiscal year ended on July 31st last year. Currently, three new headquarters for the Mutual Aid Association have been prepared and are expected to be established soon this month. These three new headquarters are located in the south of the city of Nanshi, north of Route Magendau, and in the southern part of the French Concession. It is anticipated that after these new headquarters are opened, the scope of services provided by the Mutual Aid Association to rickshaw pullers will be greatly expanded.</p>
<h3>Public Works Department Decides to Ban Public Buses from Emitting Black Smoke</h3>
<p>It has been observed that public buses in the Public Concession often emit thick black smoke while driving, sometimes soiling the clothing of passersby, which has caused disgust among the general public. It is now learned that the Public Works Department is also paying close attention to this matter and has decided to ban it. The China General Omnibus Company has been ordered to find a way to improve the situation within three months, so that they will no longer emit black smoke while driving. This matter has been under negotiation by the Public Works Department Police since 1933, but no proper solution has been found. The reason is that the gasoline used by the company is of poor quality. If they were to use other oil, the cost would be too high, resulting in financial losses for the company. However, the Police Department believes that this matter is related to the safety of citizens and the cleanliness of the city, so they have decided to ban it. However, in order to take into account the difficulties of doing business, they have granted a three-month grace period to allow for gradual improvement. It is heard that this plan has already been approved by the Public Works Department Board of Directors yesterday.</p>
<h3>Yu Hezhenya Kidnapping Case: Kidnappers Appeal Original Verdict</h3>
<p>Yu Hezhenya, housewife of Guangdong native Yu Baoshoutang, residing at No. 60 Avenue des Soeurs, French Concession, was kidnapped on October 21st of last year. The French police arrested the kidnappers Wang Fukang, Tao Shuigen, Lin De, Zhang Huizhi, Zhou Juqin (female), and suspect Li Chunxiao, a total of six men and women, rescued the hostage, and handed them over to the Second Special District Court. The Police Department attorney filed a public prosecution in accordance with the Regulations for the Punishment of Bandits. During the detention period, Tao Shuigen was injured during the resistance to arrest, and Wang Fukang became ill while in custody. Both died due to ineffective medical treatment. The case was heard and concluded on May 15th of this year. Lin De was sentenced to life imprisonment with permanent deprivation of civil rights. Zhang Huizhi and Zhou Juqin were each sentenced to fifteen years of imprisonment. Li Chunxiao was found not guilty. The cases against Wang and Tao were dismissed. This has been reported previously. It is now learned that the three male and female convicts, Lin, Zhang, and Zhou, are dissatisfied with the verdict and have appealed to the Third High Court. The Second Special District Court has already submitted the case file to the High Court for review. Yesterday morning, Judge Wang Yue opened an investigation hearing, first bringing the appellants Lin, Zhang, and Zhou to the case to inquire about the reasons for appealing the original verdict. The three convicts' testimonies overturned their original testimonies and solely placed blame on others. The court also summoned the Western detective who handled the case to inquire about the details of solving the case. The court ruled that the appellants remain in the custody of the detention center, awaiting a scheduled retrial.</p>
<h3>Fire on Tianjin Road Yesterday Morning</h3>
<p>No. 396 Tianjin Road, Public Concession, is a shikumen building consisting of three blocks, housing seven or eight businesses, including Yifeng Xie Silk Shop, Ma Yuanfeng Clock and Watch Shop, Tongji Silk Factory Issuing Office, Xin Kang Silk Shop, and Xinyuan Yong Silk Shop. At around 4:30 yesterday morning, a fire broke out in the main room of the building. At the time, all the shop employees were sound asleep. Suddenly, they saw bright flames and immediately scrambled to escape, unable to salvage any belongings. The Central Fire Brigade received the news and rushed to the scene in vehicles. However, the narrow streets made rescue efforts difficult. It was not until two hours later that the fire was extinguished. As a result, all three buildings at No. 396 were completely destroyed, and the fire also spread to neighboring residences at No. 402, No. 395, No. 397, and No. 399.

<h3>Shen Yaocheng Confirmed as the Heir to Shen Xingshan: Judgement Rendered by the Court</h3>
<p>Shen Xingshan, a native of Haimen who formerly served as a commander of the anti-smuggling camp, passed away in January of last year. Recently, Shen Yaocheng, also known as Miaocheng, the son of Shen's former wife, filed a suit in the Civil Division of the Second Special District Court against Shen's widow, Shen Hanying, also known as Shen Wu, seeking confirmation of his identity and requesting the court to order the handover of Shen Xingshan's estate. This has been reported previously. It is now learned that the Second Special District Court has concluded the trial of Shen Yaocheng's lawsuit against Shen Hanying for confirmation of identity and issued a judgment the other day. The main text of the judgment states: "The plaintiff is confirmed as the heir of the deceased Shen Xingshan. The plaintiff's remaining claims are dismissed.

<h3>Ye Fikang's Lawsuit Against Jiangnan Bank Settled: Court Orders Suspension of Trial Proceedings</h3>
<p>Lawyer Ye Fikang entrusted the Jiangnan Bank branch in his hometown of Wujiang to remit 2,000 yuan on the first of last month to the head office. The head office, on the second of the month, closed as usual due to it being a Sunday. Therefore, on the afternoon of the third, Lawyer Ye went to the Jiangnan head office to inquire if the remittance had been received. It was claimed that the money had been received, but due to timing issues, it could not be paid. Unexpectedly, the bank suddenly declared liquidation on the fourth. Lawyer Ye's remittance of 2,000 yuan was also among the defaulted cases. Lawyer Ye believed that the Jiangnan Bank's actions constituted embezzlement and breach of trust. He filed a suit with the Criminal Division of the First Special District Court against the bank's chairman, Yu Zhendongfeng, the entire board of directors, supervisors Xia Zhijun, Qian Zhixiang, Wang Yiting, Xu Qianlin, Jin Nengzhi, Han Yunfu, Yu Shouzhi, Shen Tianxin, Hu Guocheng, and others. The Special Court summoned them for questioning, but the defendants did not appear. Lawyers Yan Jiangping, Dong Chi, and Ouyang Shu appeared in court to defend them. The court adjourned the hearing to a later date. This has been reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Yang Zhaoqi continued the hearing in the Eighth Criminal Division. The defendants still did not appear. Lawyer Ouyang Shu appeared in court and stated that all the defendants were not in Shanghai and therefore could not appear in court. Subsequently, the plaintiff Ye Fikang filed a motion stating that the private prosecution portion had now been settled. However, the public prosecution portion, according to the new Criminal Code, is not a crime that can only be prosecuted upon complaint, so the prosecution cannot be withdrawn. Therefore, he can only request suspension of the trial proceedings. Judge Yang ruled that the trial proceedings for this case be suspended.</p>
<h3>Traffic Lights Installed on Xinmin Road</h3>
<p>Xinmin Road at the intersection of Datong Road in Zhabei connects to Nantong and the boundary, extending north to Liuhe, Luodian, Jiading, Baoyou, and other counties. Therefore, since the January 28th Incident, the market on this road has become increasingly bustling. Recently, the Shanghai station of the Shanghai-Taiyuan long-distance bus has moved to the Wuzhen Road bridge on the Suzhou Creek, resulting in heavy traffic of vehicles and pedestrians. Xinmin Road and Datong Road are particularly important thoroughfares. The traffic police's command of traffic is of utmost importance. Therefore, Director Ruan Kaiji of the Xin Zha District Branch specifically obtained approval from the Municipal Public Security Bureau to notify the Public Works Bureau to install a set of traffic lights at the intersection of Xinmin Road and Datong Road to facilitate police command and enhance traffic management. Yesterday, the lamp post has already been installed. Once the other procedures are completed, the lights will be turned on to direct traffic.</p>

<p>The World Peace Congress in this city, since its establishment, has gained the sympathy of the world and the approval of heads of state from various countries, such as President Marina of the Dominican Republic in South America, League of Nations Secretary-General Avenol, and the American Green Non-War Alliance.

<h3>Good News for Cooling Off</h3>
<p>Ice cream is the most noble food for cooling off in the summer, the most nutritious, and beneficial to body and mind, far better than melons and fruits. In the past, the paper-wrapped ice cream sold on the market was too expensive, costing 2 jiao per package, and a block of 1 yuan was only enough for three or four people to share. Therefore, it could only be enjoyed by the rich, and ordinary people could hardly afford it. The well-known Shengsheng Dairy has now received a license to manufacture ice cream this summer, using Shengsheng A-grade sterilized milk and pure cream to make five-color Shengsheng Cream Ice Cream. The owner of the factory, Mr. Shen Jiucheng, in order to popularize cooling off for the masses and to make more people drink food that is beneficial to the body, has set the price particularly fair, selling each pound for only 5 jiao, enough for six or seven people to eat. Readers, if you want to try it, please call (22099), and one or two pounds can be delivered. If you want to customize ice cream for banquets or entertaining guests, you can also contact in advance.</p>

<h3>Sino-American Boxer Indemnity Funds for Vocational Education Still Undecided; Cai Yuanpei and Ding Wenjiang Resign</h3>
<p>(Nanjing, 10th) For the national vocational education expenses for the 24th year of the Republic, in addition to the 2.4 million yuan included in the central government budget, another 500,000 yuan was allocated for border region education expenses. The Ministry of Education requested the Sino-British, Sino-French, Sino-American, and Sino-Belgian Boxer Indemnity Boards to jointly subsidize 800,000 yuan. While the Sino-British, etc. boards had decided to subsidize a portion, the Sino-American Boxer Indemnity Board had not yet decided. It is reported that the chairman of the board, Cai Yuanpei, and director Ding Wenjiang, were extremely indignant at the board's long delay in making a decision and have now submitted their resignations. The board is currently trying to dissuade them from resigning and it is said that a meeting will be held soon to decide on the amount of this subsidy. (Central News Agency)</p>
<h3>Ministry of Education Instructions for the Improvement of the Private Xiangya Medical College</h3>
<p>The Ministry of Education issued instructions on the 10th to the Private Xiangya Medical College. The instructions stated, in brief, "Last year, the Ministry provided key points and ordered improvements. Based on the report of the inspectors this time, the college has made considerable progress in promoting local public health in the past year. However, implementing new-style medical education programs faces many difficulties under the college's current economic conditions and should be delayed. No progress has been seen on other aspects that need improvement. The following key points are again presented for immediate and earnest implementation: (1) The college's funding is seriously inadequate. The board of directors should raise additional funds to strengthen the foundation. (2) The college lacks certain basic subject courses, and for major courses such as pharmacology, bacteriology, biology, and embryology, full-time professors must be hired to be responsible for them, and the number of teaching assistants and assistant physicians should be increased so that professors can devote time to guiding student research and practice. (3) The college's school buildings are still sufficient for use and do not need to be expanded. Priority should be given to organizing the various laboratories and enriching the equipment for basic subjects. Books must also be added for reference needs. (4) The college's professors certainly include experts with deep research, but improving some of the faculty is essential. Furthermore, while the professors mostly use English for teaching, which can improve students' ability to read Western reference books, attention must be paid to whether the teachers' lectures are fluent and whether the students can fully understand them, and appropriate corrections must be made. The above points must be followed and improved upon, and a report must be submitted. As for the college's proposed implementation of new-style programs, there are currently many difficulties and implementation should await funding certainty before submitting to the Ministry for approval."</p>

<h3>The Past and Future of the National Labor University College of Engineering (1)</h3>
<p>— Chu Minyi</p>
<p>I was ordered to take charge of this school in the 16th year of the Republic, and it has been eight years since then. At that time, the school was in the initial stage of settling a student movement, and there were many things to be managed. I discussed it with the French principal Xue Fan, and we were determined to run the school so that the students could study with peace of mind, and the school affairs would gradually improve. Now, the fourth grade of the university has been completed, and the third grade of the high school and the French language preparatory class have been promoted in order. After the students graduate, they either study abroad or serve the society, all with expertise and achievements. Our eight years of hard work have finally shown some results. Whether it is merit or sin, benevolent or wise, is not what we care about. We only have the spirit of serving in the past and continue to work hard. However, this school is jointly run by the Chinese and French governments, and the environment and facilities are special. There are some things that are not understood by the Chinese people. Therefore, I will summarize the past work and future plans as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The History of This School: Four years before the Republic, there was a German doctor named Raulun who came to Shanghai to practice medicine. After practicing medicine, he bought several acres of land and built several houses, and set up a school to teach students. This was the beginning of the establishment of this school. Later, Raulun's students increased, so he established a private medical school. At that time, the German consul Knappe, seeing that Raulun's school was doing well, obtained his consent and proposed to the German government to expand the private medical school, set up medical and engineering departments, and reorganize it into a German National University. The German government approved it and formally established it on June 3, four years before the Republic. It was Tongji University, and Raulun was still the principal. Two years before the Republic, Bao Jiang died of illness and donated all his private property to the school. The successor principal was named Schab. In the third year of the Republic, the European War broke out and Tongji University was closed and Schab left his post. When the war ended, the Treaty of Versailles was signed, stating in Article 134 that Germany abandoned all of Germany's Tongji University in the French Concession of Shanghai, and all school property was given to the Chinese and French governments. Based on this treaty, the French government consulted with the Chinese government to continue to jointly run the school, and named it the Chinese and French National Tonghui Vocational School, with industrial and commercial departments. The Chinese government and the French government each appointed a principal. The Chinese principal was Zhang Baozhen, and the French principal was Maybon. On March 10, the 10th year of the Republic, the school was formally reorganized and established. Students from far and near came to study, reaching more than 400 people. Unfortunately, in the 11th year of the Republic, the wind and tide rose and fell, and the school affairs were interrupted. Therefore, the business department was closed and the school name was changed to the Chinese and French National Industrial Vocational School. The following year, Zhang Baozhen resigned and was temporarily replaced by the Dean of Academic Affairs Hu Wenyao. Later, Mei Peng also resigned successively, and the French government sent Xue Fan Civet to succeed him. The Chinese government also officially appointed Zhu Yan as the principal, and the school affairs became more and more developed. Until March 21, the 16th year of the Republic, when the National Revolutionary Army arrived in Shanghai, the schools rose and fell, and this school was not spared. Zhu Yan left his post because of this. In April of the same year, the National Government University sent Minyi as the principal. In the 18th year of the Republic, the Ministry ordered the change to the Chinese and French National Industrial Vocational School. Soon, the annual animal husbandry and curriculum conflicted with the new regulations promulgated by the Ministry of Education. In the 20th year, the Ministry was asked to change it to an independent college. The Ministry approved it, and it was formally changed to the Chinese and French National Industry College on September 1. The presidents of the college are still Minyi and Xue Fan.</p>
<p>(2) The School's Educational Policy and Overview of Students Studying Abroad This school is the only national educational and cultural institution shared by China and France, and bears the responsibility of actually communicating Chinese and French educational culture. It is a creation and ordinary national school in the fire, and all organizational facilities are slightly different. Therefore, the school's educational policy can be said to be something to be said. This school is an industrial vocational school, and of course, it aims to train high-level industrial talents. However, because of the cooperation with the French side, all curriculum arrangements are based on French universities. The system management is absolutely strict and does not allow any excuses. All courses are directly explained and taught in French, and the lecturers are not only French scholars with deep experience, who are responsible for each course, but also outstanding Chinese scholars who have studied in France and Belgium. Students enter the school and study. In the first year, they enter the French language preparatory class. In the following year, they enter the first grade of high school and can directly listen to French lectures. After that, they are promoted in order. As for graduating from university and studying abroad for further study, it is even more learned. Those who serve the society are not only proficient in French, but also have industrial expertise, and can especially take measures. However, this school's examinations adopt strict principles. Students who fail the academic year examination will not be able to go to school, and there is absolutely no compromise. There are many courses and you must study hard. Moreover, we pay special attention to practice. The factory has complete mechanical, electrical, and gas equipment. The time for practice increases with each week and year. The higher the grade, the more practice. Therefore, people must be determined to train in school to become useful. As for tuition, the university department only charges 25 yuan per semester, and the middle school department charges 15 yuan. Accommodation is completely free. If students can save money, the fees including food and books are only one hundred and tens of yuan a year. Moreover, those who rank in the top two in the term examination are exempted from tuition fees. Therefore, most of the students studying at this school are diligent and self-motivated, and this school also takes thrift and hard work as the training policy.</p>

<h3>Municipal Bureau of Education Plans to Build Zhabei Sports Field</h3>
<p>There is a plot of public land on Liuying Road in Zhabei. In 1927, the bureau submitted a plan to the municipal government to build a public sports field. The news has been recorded in previous reports. However, negotiations on property rights have been delayed for a long time, leading to a halt in progress. Now, it has been learned that the bureau has submitted instructions from the municipal government. The case has been resolved at the 284th municipal meeting. Six mu of the land will be allocated for the Yude Elementary School campus, and the remaining forty mu will be allocated for the construction of the Zhabei Public Sports Field. The bureau is currently actively preparing with the Bureau of Public Works, which is a blessing for the tens of thousands of citizens in Zhabei.</p>

<h3>Only Unity Can Save Us (Contribution Talk)</h3>
<p>— Yang'an</p>
<p>In this precarious and critical trend, the only way for national product factories to save themselves is through united strength. Only through mutual cooperation can there be hope of existence. Price cuts and dumping are self-defeating behaviors that harm others and do not benefit oneself. Why bother with such practices? This week, there have been several positive signs in the national products sector: (1) the organization of a joint sales office by alcohol industry peers, (2) the regulation of production volume by rubber industry peers, (3) the attention to tariffs by paper industry peers, and (4) the great unification of national product industry peers throughout Jiangsu Province. Particularly gratifying is the establishment of the Industrial and Commercial Revival Committee of the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce. This committee brings together experts from various fields to decide on a work process that starts with investigating the national product industries of 41 sectors, focusing on statistics, research, guidance, and training. Like treating a disease, one must first find the root cause before administering appropriate and effective medicine to achieve revival. It is generally recognized that the main task of investigation should focus on the reasons for the business slump, followed by determining a relief plan. Summarizing the points raised by the committee members, they include (1) insufficient capital, (2) excessively high interest rates from banks, (3) excessive expenses and huge expenditures, leading to high costs, (4) poor accounting systems, (5) unsuitable management methods, (6) insufficient marketing efforts, and (7) losses in procuring raw materials. These are all areas that require research and guidance, and they are not just the concern of one industry or one factory but are truly a matter of life and death for the entire industry. The most important thing is for everyone to unite and proceed together.</p>
<h3>Please Expedite the Government's Removal of Transit Tax (National Products Forum)</h3>
<p>— Xuanwan</p>
<p>The national products movement, which was once booming for several years, has still not achieved better results, and although there are multiple reasons for this, one of the biggest reasons is that the transit tax and export tax have not yet been abolished, which has hindered the smooth progress of national products. Recently, the Ministry of Finance suggested to the central government to reduce or exempt export tax and transit tax separately, and it was reviewed, revised and passed by the Legislative Yuan on May 20. The measures for reducing and exempting export tax have been officially announced on June 26, which is indeed good news for the future of national products, but the transit tax, which was originally scheduled to be abolished from July 1, has been delayed and there is no news yet. We can't help but hope for it, and at the same time, it also triggered my motivation to write this article.</p>
<p>As everyone knows, the reason why foreign goods were able to flood our country's markets in the past is that they relied on tariff agreements as a talisman. When their goods entered, they only needed to pay the regular tax once, and they could be freely sold throughout our country's interior, unimpeded, and they could balance their selling prices in various places and flood the market without any loopholes. But what about ourselves? If we want to import a little national product into the interior, we need to pay taxes at the border and at each province. We need to complete tax payments at every turn, and after going through layers of complicated procedures, because of the transportation tax, its selling price has to be raised like the tide, for example, a enamel basin that costs four or five cents in Shanghai must be sold for eight or nine cents, or even more than one yuan, in Xi'an, Lanzhou, Chongqing, Kunming and other places. Therefore, under such restrictions, it is difficult for national products to develop, and it is simply impossible to compete with foreign goods.</p>
<p>Now, let's look at the current situation of taxation in various countries. According to the theory of modern national taxes, transit tax is also a very unreasonable tax because the country takes taxation as a regular income on the one hand, but at the same time, it also contains the principle of protecting its own economy. All countries in the world impose heavy taxes on the import of domestic substitutes and general luxury goods, but as for the circulation and development of domestic goods, they not only exempt taxes but also use various political forces to do their best to support them to encourage their progress, and the strategy of tackling the problem from both sides makes it impossible for foreign goods to gain a foothold in the country and the problem of import surplus is solved.</p>
<p>In short, China's economic plight is so serious right now. We know that the only way to solve it is to "promote national products", and at the current stage of striving for the national products movement, please expedite the government's removal of transit tax and formally announce it. It has become the one thing we most eagerly hope for. We want to take this precious key to solve the difficulties of the national industrial and commercial sector and to inspire a new life for the promotion of national products.</p>
<h3>The Little Customs of Summer Drinks (National Products Talk)</h3>
<p>— Xiaobai</p>
<p>I often think to myself, why do the people of a country have to have even the things they eat provided by others? That's not just a matter of not being patriotic, but it's also forgetting one's own benefits and obligations in this world. This situation is not the phenomenon of the people of an independent country. People with blood are determined not to spend their good money on satisfying their appetites and willingly give it to others. But in our country's society, it's all "common practice", which is really a "painful mystery"!</p>
<p>These few days, the weather is getting hot again, and the imported drinks and food on the market will gradually flood in. According to the facts in the past, we can clearly know that imported cold drinks are a great opportunity for large-scale sales in the summer. What soda? Beer? Orange juice? Ice cream? In many bars and restaurants, they often become their exclusive market. It can be said that eight or nine out of ten are pure foreign goods, with a kind of unbreakable potential force, which is really very undesirable. If this phenomenon continues, if the big customs enter the small customs again, it will definitely wipe out our lives.</p>
<p>I have also carefully studied the reasons why Chinese people eat imported food and drinks. It can be divided into two categories. The first type of people are poor. They patronize foreign goods because they are cheaper. The second type of people are sloppy. They eat first and talk later, or they always seem to be too lazy to care. They don't even know when foreign goods are in their mouths, and they all think that what a person eats is very limited and does not affect the overall situation. They don't know that from small to large, "a trickle of water can become a river," and "a spark can start a prairie fire." In ordinary times, perhaps no one would have thought that it would promote China's economy to a fatal injury, but after years of accumulation, it would reveal the harm of this injury.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the end, I dare to put forward very earnestly that at present, we can only hope that everyone can pay close attention to this issue, some of us strive to correct the mistakes of the past, and those who don't have them should work harder. Fortunately, among the current national cold drinks, such as Yili Soda, Guanshengyuan Candied Fruit Dew, and Invincible Brand Fresh Orange Juice, they are clean and hygienic, and the price is low, and everything can surpass foreign goods, so why be nostalgic for imports? Here, I would like to remind everyone to remember the two famous sayings of Germany's implementation of the national products movement: "Don't put foreign food on your table," and "What really gives us energy is only our own bread, fruit, and beer." Please be careful and don't let any more imported food enter your mouth.</p>
<h3>Mr. Wu Zhihui Advocates for National Products (National Products Story)</h3>
<p>— Wang Shouqiu</p>
<p>Mr. Wu Zhihui recently told a story. The story said that during the Jiaqing and Daoguang years, one of his female relatives married a husband. After some time, the husband suddenly lost his job, and of course, he couldn't maintain the family's life. So he specialized in doing needlework for others, earning a few coins to supplement the family's income. But because the income was small, he only ate two meals a day. Even if he had breakfast, he would never ask others for a loan before the next meal. Sometimes, when there was no food to eat, he would stuff cloth scraps into the stove and burn them to make smoke come out of the chimney, as if he was cooking. Although her husband only had a blue cloth gown, it was always washed and ironed neatly, without a trace of dirt. After eighteen years like this, her husband finally found a job, and of course, their family situation improved!</p>
<p>The purpose of his story is to say that we Chinese people should also imitate this spirit in this time of economic difficulty, being frugal ourselves, not relying on foreigners, and not promoting foreign goods for others, wasting the cash that can be used as capital for agriculture, industry, and commerce. If we are consistently frugal, we can naturally have the same happy ending as that female relative. We are very touched by this story. In the current Chinese economy, we have reached a time when there is nothing we can do. To save this economic poverty and overcome this economic difficulty, there is simply no way other than promoting national products and not using foreign goods. Therefore, knowledgeable people are shouting the slogans of promoting national products and using national products. Unfortunately, Chinese people are used to enjoying themselves. Because foreign goods are exquisite and ingenious, they are all going to use foreign goods, so large amounts of cash flow out to foreign countries, and Chinese industry and commerce are affected by this, creating a phenomenon of economic poverty. This is really heartbreaking!</p>
<p>Now, China's national products industry has made considerable progress through the efforts of the Chinese people. We very much hope that the Chinese people will learn from that woman from the Jiaqing and Daoguang years, working hard and encouraging themselves. Good national products should of course be adopted, and even slightly inferior national products should be purchased with patience. Never rely on foreign goods. Know that purchasing foreign goods is tantamount to committing suicide. Smart Chinese people should not do the foolish thing of digging their own graves, right?</p>
<h3>Review of Summer National Products (National Products Investigation)</h3>
<p>— Zhang Mengzhao</p>
<p>The Student National Products Year, in this time of national crisis, its responsibility is heavier! Its mission is more urgent! Time flies, and the so-called "Student National Products Year" has passed half a year!</p>
<p>When we review the past and look to the future, we can't help but shudder! The plum rain season has just passed, and the hot summer has arrived! The activity of national products and the efforts of the summer vacation student movement are taking the lead! It is only at this time. I wrote "A Review of Summer National Products" for Yan Yun Ben Kan.</p>
<p>In terms of clothing: Tongya's light crepe miro, Hongxin's light and cool cloth, Sanyou's sweat towel yukata, Wuhe's goose brand undershirt, as well as Shengfang, Hangfang, Guangdong yunsha, and Wanzai ramie, are all extremely suitable and courteous to wear.</p>
<p>In terms of food: In addition to the domestic white rice and fragrant porridge, Taikang and Guanshengyuan's bread, soda biscuits, various vegetable seed dews, yu beans cakes, and homemade yu beans soup, Yili soda, Yantai beer, Sanle and Fenghua's peaches, Shangyu bayberries, Three Whites watermelon from the four villages, and Qingpi Green Meat sweet cantaloupe from Shitangwan, etc....</p>
<p>In terms of supplies: Apple's green small electric bubbles. Huasheng fans, Lihe brand enamelware, Samsung brand mosquito incense, Sanyou She Samsung brand invincible brand soap, various perfumes, talcum powder, Triangle brand West Lake towels, China Chemical Industry Co.'s soy sauce essence, Tianchu MSG, Wuzhou's guben soap, fly killer, and other simple and practical large cattail fans, Pu mats, etc....</p>
<p>The above-mentioned "Summer National Products" are just what the reporter remembers well and contributes to the readers. There are still many national products worth introducing in the summer, and it is impossible to list them all. I hope that Chinese people will write about them because of my clumsy work, introduce and report to each other, and make compatriots pay attention and remember firmly, which will be beneficial to the future of this year's national products!</p>
<h3>Condolences on the Zhenjiang Ban on the National Goods City Bazaar (Offering Advice)</h3>
<p>— Ba Ling</p>
<p>Recently, I came across the following news item in the newspaper, which I believe is worth discussing. I am reprinting it below and expressing my personal views on this matter.</p>
<p>"The Zhenjiang Industry Guilds jointly sent a letter to the Chamber of Commerce regarding the Shanghai National Goods City Bazaar's plan to conduct a short-term business operation in Zhenjiang. The letter stated that small national goods manufacturers frequently borrow names to deceive government officials in the province, setting up bazaars for competitive sales. The goods are also very ordinary, and already available in various stores. The value lies in the convenience of obtaining duty-free and tax-free status, and low transportation costs, which can be used to attract customers and sell off accumulated goods. Although the period is temporary, the damage to local businesses is not insignificant. In this time of sluggish market conditions, the principle of local support for local business is already severely compromised. How can we withstand further external encroachment? After receiving the letter, the Chamber of Commerce has telegraphed the provincial and county party and government agencies, requesting strict prohibition to maintain the market and protect business interests."</p>
<p>After reading this news, I couldn't help but feel a sense of dismay for a long time! I think this is a problem worth discussing for the future of national goods. Now, let me stand in an objective position and do a simple analysis of this matter.</p>
<p>(A) From the perspective of the National Goods City Bazaar: The purpose of the National Goods City Bazaar's visit to Zhenjiang this time is undoubtedly to promote national goods. This legitimate and reasonable goal seems to be beyond reproach. However, in my opinion, the National Goods City Bazaar should pay attention to the following points when going to Zhenjiang to do business, so as not to be opposed by local merchants. (In fact, no matter where you go to set up a bazaar, the following points must always be taken into account.)</p>
<p>(1) Obtain the consent of local chambers of commerce, industry guilds, and other organizations in advance.</p>
<p>(2) The selling price must be equal to the local goods, so as not to cause adverse effects due to the operation of the National Goods City Bazaar.</p>
<p>(3) The goods must be genuine products from well-known national goods factories, so as not to be criticized.</p>
<p>(B) From the perspective of the Zhenjiang business community: From the perspective of the Zhenjiang business community, industry guilds, and the Zhenjiang Chamber of Commerce, I believe that the following matters should also be noted, so that many unnecessary disputes can be reduced if similar events occur in the future.</p>
<p>(1) It is necessary to recognize that the purpose of the National Goods City Bazaar's visit to Zhenjiang is to promote national goods, spread national goods, and sell national goods; it is a good intention, not a malicious one.</p>
<p>(2) In order to avoid the National Goods City Bazaar from dumping cheap goods, it is best to stipulate the selling price in advance to avoid the impact of cheap dumping on local goods.</p>
<p>(3) Before the National Goods City Bazaar arrives, it is best to prepare a list of the goods needed in Zhenjiang and report it through circular letters. This will definitely eliminate the resentment of the local business community in Zhenjiang, and at the same time, it can also get an unexpected welcome from the local business community and the public?</p>
<p>Based on the above opinions, I believe that if both parties can do this, cooperate with mutual understanding, not only can this unfortunate dispute be reduced, but perhaps there will be an unexpected gain! I wonder if the readers and parties involved agree?</p>
<h3>Discussion on Revitalizing Jiangxi Porcelain Industry (National Goods Discussion)</h3>
<p>— Liang Yingzhong</p>
<p>Porcelain is a necessity for daily use. It has a wide range of uses. And the porcelain produced in Jiangxi is one of the national quintessences of our country. It was invented the earliest. It occupies a long history in the country's products. Its quality is beautiful and excellent. It is exquisite and delicate. It comes from nature. It is truly unparalleled. It is far from comparable to those produced elsewhere. Therefore, it can be used by people and welcomed everywhere. Moreover, ancient porcelain treasures become more valuable with age. Many people like to collect and treasure them for appreciation. Therefore, it is sold at home and abroad, and it is famous all over the world, which greatly enhances the glory of national goods. Unfortunately, in recent years, due to the influx of foreign goods and other influences, this national porcelain with historical value has plummeted and is on the verge of bankruptcy, which is heartbreaking to say! I have been involved in the porcelain industry for many years, and I know the situation quite well. Therefore, I write down the details to guide those who care about the national product business, so as to seek improvement and promote it.</p>
<p>The place of origin of the porcelain industry is Jingdezhen in Jiangxi, located on the border of Anhui and Jiangxi, surrounded by mountains, with narrow and shallow rivers. Ships transporting porcelain cannot reach directly. They all dock below Raozhou. The export of porcelain goods is carried out by small barges to large ships, which are transshipped and easily broken, resulting in huge losses. Therefore, it is urgent to reorganize transportation. In the National Construction Strategy written by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, there was a plan to move the porcelain kilns to the foot of Mount Lu, which was also due to transportation considerations.</p>
<p>In the past, porcelain leaving the country was subject to numerous taxes. It was once cancelled after the government's order to abolish the likin. Not long after, the Jiangxi provincial government, in the name of production and sales tax, still collected it according to the original rules. At the same time, there were six items such as paper and tea that were taxed, all of which were included. Although we ran around and appealed, and petitioned repeatedly, it was of no effect. Now I hear that the other five items have been abolished, but the porcelain tax still exists and is still paid as usual. Such measures are unfair and not the way to protect national goods. I deeply hope that the government authorities will understand the difficulties of businesses and order the tax bureau to be abolished as soon as possible to maintain national goods. I can't help but look forward to praying for its early realization.</p>
<p>The manufacturing of porcelain in our country has always used manual labor since ancient times. It has not been improved until now. Therefore, the delivery of goods is slow, and the cost is very high. In addition, the old method of burning kilns results in uneven heat and heavy losses. Foreign porcelain is all machine-made, fast and convenient, neat and beautiful, ten thousand times better than ours. It is not difficult to know that national porcelain is difficult to compete with. Moreover, our country does not have protectionist tariffs, allowing them to invade and flood the market, so that national porcelain is affected, and it is difficult to recover and gradually declines. Among foreign porcelain, the rest of the items are not counted for the time being. Just take the item of various vegetable basins as an example. For example, in restaurants and banquet tables everywhere, except for a few Cantonese restaurants that use national porcelain, the plates and dishes used are all foreign porcelain. Even in daily household use, they are everywhere. Therefore, its sales volume has exceeded the total turnover of national porcelain. It is really shocking. For the present plan, if we want to save the decline of national porcelain, we must study and improve it, and change it to machine-made, so that we can compete with foreign goods, and there is still hope for a turnaround. Otherwise, the future is dangerous, and it is really unimaginable.</p>
<p>Most of the porcelain merchants in the country are Hubei people, scattered in various provinces, capitals, mountains and towns, and there are a large number of them. Shanghai has always been known as the leader of the national porcelain industry. The area around the City God Temple is the essence of the industry, with numerous shops and large scale. Not only is it the source of business in this city, but also the wholesale of foreign merchants and exports to Europe and the United States are mostly concentrated in procurement, and the prosperity of trade is the best in the country. Unfortunately, the industry lacks unity, each seeks its own interests, and is extremely scattered. Therefore, everything is followed in the same way, and there is very little improvement and evolution, resulting in foreign porcelain being squeezed out and almost eliminated. At this time of crisis, they still do not know how to be alert. There are also ignorant elements who do not examine the reasons for failure to seek a fundamental solution, but abandon the fundamentals and pursue the trivial, recklessly transporting a large amount of inferior goods, soliciting customers at bargain prices, attracting buyers, and taking the opportunity to disturb the market, thinking that they have succeeded. I don't know that the quality of the goods is poor, even if the price is low, what is the benefit? As a result, users are more dissatisfied with national porcelain, and even more abandoned by people, giving foreign porcelain a chance to improve. Such upside-down absurdity is not only of no practical help, but also like drinking poison to quench thirst, and accelerating its demise. Therefore, I said that if we want to solve the crisis of national porcelain, we must work hard to advance directly, improve the method of manufacturing, to reduce costs and cheapen prices, and improve quality and improve products, to meet the trend and facilitate sales, both of which are equally important, to achieve the true meaning of cheap and good quality, and to strengthen the faith of the outside world, then the difficult situation of the porcelain industry can be broken, and the victory of the future can be grasped with confidence. I ask the porcelain industry officials, what do you think?</p>
<p>In summary, the main reasons for the failure of the Jiangxi porcelain industry have been briefly stated here. If we can carefully consider the situation, remove the difficulties, and improve the bad things, then it will rise straight up and gradually become prosperous, which is what we expected. In the future, when the trend prevails, it will eliminate all traces of foreign porcelain, and even sell to foreign countries, adding a unique color to the national goods industry. It is not only the fortune of the porcelain industry's future, but also the recovery of national interests depends on it. I hope that the enlightened people at home and abroad will not hesitate to give advice to facilitate the progress, and I hope that the Chinese people will enthusiastically support and jointly promote it.</p>

<p>— (Xiao Bai)</p>
<p>In those so-called literary publications that have appeared recently, I always see some boring verses, such as "Ah, the fire of youth! It's burning, and the fountain of a loving heart can't be contained." Such extremely nauseating words simply make one's head ache and want to vomit for three days. However, here, it also reminds me of an old poem. I remember the original text was like this: "Married at eighteen, husband went out at nineteen, didn't return at twenty, this year twenty-one." This is a description with the same meaning and content, but how powerful is the latter? In the expression of the words, it is enough to penetrate the reader's heart, and it is full of implicit writing. No wonder it is popular and makes people never forget it.</p>
<h3>Intent to Emphasize Agriculture</h3>
<p>— Luo Zheng</p>
<p>The newspaper on June 29 reported that the Havas Agency's Rome electric report on the 27th: The harvest season for wheat in the Ridolia province is approaching. Prime Minister Mussolini went to the newly built villages and farmhouses of Polgu, Basutia, and Sapodia in the province this morning to participate in the work, in order to show his emphasis on agriculture. He also took off his upper clothes and engaged in wheat harvesting for three hours. Afterwards, he went to the tenant worker registration office to sign for his salary. Then he gave a speech to the farmers, saying: "At this moment, we are all good farmers, and in the future we will be good soldiers." His impassioned spirit was overflowing in his words, and everyone who heard it was moved...</p>
<p>Originally, the country takes the people as its foundation, and the people take food as their heaven. If we want to talk about building the country, we must first alleviate the people's difficulties and enable the people to live and work in peace and contentment without worrying about food and clothing. However, before we even mention how to alleviate the poverty of the people, we must first advocate protecting agriculture. Because we must first strengthen the rural areas so that we can enrich the people's food supply. With sufficient food, the national treasury will naturally be fearless. When there is accumulated grain in the year and the people have no worries about food, the people will naturally live a stable life, work hard in production, construction, enjoy their work, and live in peace. Now, the Italian Prime Minister, Old Man Mussolini, does not hesitate to go to the countryside to participate in wheat harvesting and receive wages. How great is this spirit of promoting agriculture!</p>
<p>It is found that our country was originally an agricultural country. The soil is fertile, the climate is mild, and the mountains, rivers, and land are abundant. The local goods and products are abundant, and they have always been the leader in the world. Judging from the total population of our country, farmers account for more than seven-tenths. From this, it can be seen that agriculture is important to our country's national economy and people's livelihood. Unfortunately, in the past, our country was plagued by internal strife, foreign aggression, natural disasters, and man-made disasters. The urban commercial industry has been shocked by the world's economic panic and the climax of depression. For several years, the collapse of the embankment has been impossible to save. Therefore, all industries are in decline, and purchasing power is weakening day by day. At the same time, the countryside is also troubled by successive wars and bandits, with bandits everywhere, bandits like hairs, mourning everywhere, and starvation everywhere. The collapse of the rural economy has reached its peak. Now every citizen is still unable to make ends meet, let alone other things. Therefore, I advocate that those who want to save the country must first appease the people. The way to appease the people should first start with relieving agriculture and protecting the countryside. But I think that to do this, we must improve the living standards of farmers, popularize farmer education, and increase production efficiency.</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Sixteen: The Hidden Cries Behind the Curtains Cannot Escape Cold Eyes, Elegant Attire Boasts of Fortune, Once Reaching the Doors of Power</p>
<p>In Little Western Paradise, besides me, who else would care about this kind of nosy business? I'll go, only I'll go. Thinking of this place, I couldn't care about anything else. So I put on my clothes and got out of bed, opening the door and walking into the courtyard. In a world without electric lights, at two o'clock in the morning, everywhere is pitch black. Zhiqian groped and walked to the corridor outside the house. He didn't know what kind of tile he had knocked over, and he heard a clang sound by the pillar. He immediately stopped and looked at the rooms of the other travelers around him. Only the dim yellow light from the glass windows was visible. Besides the snoring of one or two guests, there was no other sound. Zhiqian took two steps back, leaned against the wall, and thought quietly. He thought to himself, "Am I not being a bit hasty? How am I going to fight this injustice? Even if Yueying is resisting him there, he has already bought her body with silver, and he can naturally dispose of her. A person living in the same hotel, even if others are gambling or smoking opium, can't interfere, let alone he is openly marrying a concubine?" After thinking about it this way, he retreated back into the house. Fortunately, it was so late at night that even if he went in and out ten times, no one would notice. And luckily, this action put an end to those random thoughts on the pillow, and then he lay down and slept peacefully. Originally, he couldn't have gotten up early the next morning. But Mr. Zhang Jiefu, who lived next door, started talking loudly early in the morning and didn't stop, so he woke him up. In a daze, he heard him say "Officer Ying" several times. When he woke up, he heard him clearly. (262)</p>
<h3>Autobiography of a Dancer</h3>
<p>— Yiqiu</p>
<p>My life comes from the embrace of men. Every time the night falls, I must put on heavy makeup, dress myself up as the most beautiful toy, and send it to the glamorous and luxurious dance hall for the young masters to enjoy.</p>
<p>When I first entered the dance hall, those men didn't pay much attention to me. The owner of the dance hall told me to work hard on the word "smile".</p>
<p>I studied the word "smile" for several months, and they gradually paid attention to me. My progress gradually improved, but my virgin purity was also ruined on this word "smile".</p>
<p>One night, when I was showing off my charm and performing my "smile" skills under the brilliant neon lights, suddenly a young man in a suit walked up, pulled my hand, and I took the opportunity to fall into his arms. With the rhythm of the music, I swayed and swayed on the smooth floor, once, twice, constantly swaying.</p>
<p>He hugged my waist tightly, kissed my hair frequently, I knew he was drunk in my fragrance, ah! The credit of perfume!</p>
<p>At that time, I felt very happy and honored that there was a superior man (?) to embrace me. At the same time, I was also very surprised, why is it considered social interaction for a man to hug a woman? Ah! Mysterious city!</p>
<p>From then on, he must come to hug me dozens of times every night, open champagne, and sit at the table. He really spent some money on me.</p>
<p>One night, he suddenly said to me: "Please go to room 208 of Yipinxiang after the show!" Although I was very hesitant at the time, I finally agreed quickly, because he was my only meal ticket.</p>
<p>After that night at Yipinxiang, I cried bitterly for several days, and remorse, resentment, and secrets were closely intertwined in my heart. At this time, I thoroughly understood that I was not a human being; I was the toy of the young masters; I was the decoration of the metropolis! From then on, the precious virginity also bid farewell to me forever!</p>
<h3>Continued Records of Ancient Names for Modern Things</h3>
<p>— Wang Min</p>
<p>Now, secret reporting boxes are also popular in government offices. This thing was called "xungtong" in ancient times, which was seen in the Biography of Zhao Guangben in the Book of Han. As for official household goods, laws were called "lingjia" in ancient times, and official documents were called "bangzi" in ancient times. Also, anonymous letters were called "yinzhang" in ancient times, which are all ancient books.</p>
<p>The category of cloth and silk is often seen in ancient books, such as ramie cloth which was called "baiyue" in ancient times, and cotton yarn woven cloth which was called "baidie" in ancient times. There are many classes to test.</p>
<p>The tow rope used by boatmen was called "baizhang" in ancient times, and the small tool for reeling silk was called "ziche" in ancient times. The tool used by porters to carry orders on mountains was called "fuyu" in ancient times. These are all ancient names for modern tools.</p>
<p>There are bamboo hand shapes sold on the market, which are used to scratch itches; according to the ancient Ruyi. The long thirty Lvz Zhong Zhuyan says; has remembered an article about Ruyi, roughly saying: "In ancient times, bones, horns, bamboo and wood were used to cut out fingernails, which were used to scratch itches. However, the shape of Ruyi was changed to a cloud-shaped curve. I don't know when it started?"</p>
<p>In the Song Dynasty, there was silks, commonly written as silk carving, woven in Dingzhou. Do not use a large machine, but use cooked colors and light on the wooden frame. According to what you want, make flowers, plants, birds, beasts, pavilions, and buildings. When weaving with a small shuttle, leave the place first, and use miscellaneous colored threads to attach to the warp and weft to form a pattern. It is extremely ingenious. Now Hangzhou Du Jinsheng is famous for weaving silk scenery, or it is also the intention of silk carving.</p>
<p>Yanzi, ancient name Yuer, in the Song Dynasty palace, there was also a throwing game, to the point of making an olive shape, only a small pot and engraving, two, three, four, five, six, pushing and rotating in a jade basin, for a long time before it falls, and the one who hits the number wins, which is also the dice of today.</p>
<p>Attached note The previous month's issue of this publication carried my "Ancient Names for Modern Things". The first line was missing the word "shang" under the water character, and the last word in the 25th line, "ju", was mistakenly written as "ji", and the 56th line, "jian", was mistakenly written as "zhuan", and they have been corrected.</p>
<p>Drunk Chi Sheng's letter, reading the twenty-ninth of your publication "Yu Xiang Piao Miao Lu Novel": Describes the imperial physician treating the empress dowager. It says: "The four imperial physicians were divided into two sides. Each side had two people, and they carefully stretched out their hands. Using their fingertips through a silk scarf, they quietly took the pulse of the empress dowager... They did not use a watch to calculate the number of pulses, but only used five fingers to press. How could they know the patient's condition?... After a long time, the imperial physicians on the left and right sides quietly switched over to each other." According to medical experts, only three fingers are used to take the pulse, why use five fingers? Also, three fingers take the pulse, and they are appropriate for the "cun, guan, chi" three parts. Each side has two people, how can they press at the same time? But according to the above situation: it seems that two people are taking the pulse at the same time. In short, these two points are also a small mistake.</p>

<h3>Imperial Fragrance Drifting Record</h3>
<p>— Original by Princess Deling of the Qing Dynasty, Translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Forcing a person who is not sick to take medicine together with a sick person is a bit too autocratic! And I think it's very dangerous. Could it be that a good person will not cause any reaction if he drinks this cup of medicine for no reason? But according to what the empress dowager told me later: Yao, the unreasonable regulations, were left over from hundreds of years ago, and were not specially created by the empress dowager. Its intention is to prevent those who are imperial physicians from being bribed and adding poison to the medicine, trying to assassinate the emperor or the empress dowager. Like this, they are first taught to drink it themselves, so they don't have to be afraid anymore. Fortunately, after these doctors have withdrawn, they can drink some other medicine themselves to maintain their own health. (Here is also a statement: readers may think that nowadays there is no poisonous medicine that can kill people in Chinese medicine shops, and even if there is, it is not easy for people to buy: but in the past, there were many poisonous medicines that could kill people and they were easy to get, like crane crown red is one of them.)</p>
<p>Although the empress dowager was used to it, she almost burst out laughing when she saw the four imperial physicians drink the medicine so simply.</p>
<p>"Isn't that too surprising! They drank it so happily, as if the medicine had no bitter taste at all." The old Buddha held the jade bowl and said jokingly, "But I don't believe that there is any reason why this medicine is not bitter"? (362)</p>

<h3>West Lake Summer Retreat</h3>
<p>— Wuyai</p>
<p>The scenery of West Lake is best at Xiling, backing onto the mountains and facing the lake, as if in a green and verdant book, not like the New Market Square where everything is visible at a single glance. The year before last, I stayed at the Resting and Recuperating Society, and there was the line: “The fragrance of white lotus flowers ascends to the upper floor.” The three enchanting lines about “Ling’er sunny, Sha’er rainy, Sha’er thunderous” are especially unforgettable. However, I only stayed for ten days, and with the heat reaching ninety-seven degrees, I fled back to my office. This year, I returned to Xiling and stayed at the Butterfly Come Hotel. The heat reached eighty-seven degrees, but in the plum rain season, I didn't feel stifled. There were no mosquitoes or flies, and I found the food, drink, and daily life quite comfortable, as the architectural facilities are all of the highest European and American standards. My wife and I shared a room, with two beds inside, as well as a bathroom with flushing toilet and toiletries. The walls and floor are all tiled, cleaner than at home. The waiters in white all speak Western languages, and there are separate attendants in blue for cleaning duties. The bright windows and clean desks are absolutely free of dust, and outside the gauze window is a red corridor to sit in. A lawn of over a thousand square feet is spacious and cool, surrounded by a winding corridor, as depicted by Wu Youru. Looking south at West Lake, the mountains overlap and the waters meander, the willows are shaded and the flowers are bright, as if not in the Grand View Garden, occupying the Yi Hong Courtyard, and in reality even surpassing it. The Red Mansion doesn't have such a large rockery and pond. There are many rooms with the same comfort, and the guests are mostly distinguished figures, quiet and without clamor. Only the sound of crows can be heard all day, and small boats appear and disappear among the willow branches, like living photographs. The mountains and waters, mist and clouds, are constantly changing, and I never tire of watching them for a month. I originally stayed in a hospital in Shanghai, but moved here because it was inconvenient. The rent was originally seven dollars, but after negotiating for a monthly rate, it was only six dollars, with four meals a day for both of us, totaling only two dollars and forty cents, which can be said to be extremely economical. My friend and his wife live on the third floor, which is even more economical, with meal expenses of only twenty dollars a month, and the room rate is only one and a half dollars. Opening the window facing the lake, the view is even more distant, and it is said that snowy and moonlit nights are especially beautiful. It reminds me that there is no more economical way to live than this new household system, as the attendants respond extremely quickly; at the push of a button, they arrive immediately. Both Chinese and Western food and drink are exquisitely clean, and even late at night or early in the morning, they can be readily provided. The dining room is especially luxurious and bright, and after the meal, there is a room for reading newspapers, with a radio and small golf course to provide entertainment. For walks, there is a lush green garden, fishing along the lake, or yachting, which are all excellent choices. The location is in the center of West Lake, east to Gushan and Baidi, and west to Sudi and the Six Bridges. There are three cars available, which can reach Yuquan and Lingyin. The cars are equipped with radios, and the road is filled with music, turning Hangzhou into a juice state. There is a cinema and a library nearby, so I believe that the enjoyment of the Grand View Garden cannot surpass this. I once traveled in a sedan chair for three days, and boated on Xixi for one day. Tracing back my travels, I have visited five countries and eleven provinces. The saying that West Lake is the most famous scenic spot in the world is truly not an empty boast, but those who live in the city cannot appreciate it.</p>

<h3>Finance: Hong Kong Market Initially Loosens, Then Tightens; Gold Speculation Also Weakens, Then Stabilizes</h3>
<p>Resulting in a three-yuan increase compared to before the closure, but a ten-yuan decrease compared to the previous day's grey market.</p>
<p>The gold market experienced a sharp rise in the grey market the day before yesterday due to the National Army's Anniversary of the Oath-Taking Ceremony, which was a holiday. However, yesterday's market saw foreign silver shrinking unsatisfactorily, and the spot market turned bearish. In addition, the forward silver market reported a rebound. The market fell as soon as it opened. The Hong Kong market was initially strong, then gradually tightened. The morning market weakened before recovering. Upon investigation, it was found that foreign telegraphs had circulated during the closure period, indicating that both the British and American silver markets had shrunk. The big players in the spot market said that the United States had made large purchases, and that after the market closed, India had turned to buying, and sellers were waiting and watching, so the market was strong. The forward silver prices in Monger shrank by five percent and rose by three and a half percent, respectively. Exchange rates all increased. London spot gold fell by five pence. News reports and foreign telegraphs all favored silver prices, so the over-the-counter preparatory transactions opened at forty-two or three yuan (a rise compared to before the closure, but a fall compared to the previous day's grey market). Sellers were reluctant, and even retreated to thirty-eight or nine yuan. After the opening, the Central Bank announced that both British and American silver had shrunk, and the customs gold unit rose by 1.7 percent. The standard gold speculation price was listed at 872.5 yuan. After the opening, the market was still relatively stable, rising to over forty yuan at one point. Banks flooded the market with offers, and selling pressure remained strong. It was anticipated that HSBC's listing would reveal an increase of 1.25 in British silver and 0.25 in American silver, and the market gradually declined. The Jewish merchant Qiao Zhifu immediately came to flood the market with offers. Although the market fell after that, it was still stable, with frequent fluctuations. Later, Reuters telegraphed that the British exchange rate in Hong Kong had risen sharply by 2.25 pence, and the spot market was extremely strong. Suppliers gathered, lacking buyers, and selling pressure rose, causing the market to fall. The Hong Kong market shrank by 0.25, then rose by 0.375. Sassoon and Qiao Zhifu repeatedly flooded the market with offers, and the process became even stronger, and the market became even weaker. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong market then reported a continuous softening of 0.625. Buyers acted in concert, and large players also came to cover their positions, gradually rising to over forty yuan. Reuters telegraphed that Indian silver was expected to rise by five annas in July. In the afternoon, support retreated to within forty yuan. The morning situation was unclear, with initial declines followed by gains, and the trend was still fluctuating. The half-day market situation is recorded below:</p>
<p>The morning opening was 839.2 yuan, slightly higher by 3.4 yuan compared to before the closure. Although Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, and Sui retreated from 9.3 yuan to 8 yuan, the Central Bank's customs gold listing rose by 1.7 percent. Huixiang, Hengyu, Fusheng, Yong, etc., bought, rising to 40.2 yuan. Fuxingyong, Dadecheng, Houyu, Shenfeng, Hengchang, Yongshunmao took advantage of the high prices to supply, falling to 37 yuan. Dada, Hengchang, Yong, Fuxingyong, and Huixiang bought, rising again to 40 yuan. It was anticipated that HSBC's listing would not move, but the market was stable. However, it was soon corrected to an increase of 1.25 and 0.25. Hengchang, Yong, Hengyu, Changda sold, retreating to 37.2 yuan. Dada, Dingtai, Chunyuan, Yongtong, Yurun, and Shangna, rose to 8.5 yuan. Qiao Zhifu sold August US dollars at 8.125.

Hengyu and Changda unloaded, retreating to 5.8 yuan. Wanfeng and Huixiang advanced again to 7.4 yuan. Unexpectedly, the Hong Kong market reported an initial sharp rise of 2.25 pence. The spot market said that there were large-scale sales with no buyers. Fuxingyong, Futaiyong, Chunyuan, Shui, Wanfeng, Hengyu, Yuanheng, and Zi sold, falling to 2.8 yuan. The Hong Kong market rebounded by 0.25. Dada, Fuxingyong, and Huixiang bought, rising to 14.5 yuan. Sassoon came out with July credit at 1.125. The Hong Kong market loosened again by 0.375.

Tongtaichang, Jiarun, Yifengyong, Shenyu, Yuanmao, Yuanchangyong, Huixiang, Zhongfeng, Hengxingyuan, etc., came to buy, and sentiment turned good, rebounding to 41.5 yuan. Fuxingyong, Wanfeng delayed their move. Reuters reported that Indian silver was expected to rise by five annas in July. The Hong Kong market tightened and then loosened again, retreating to 38.3 yuan. The noon closing was 838.9 yuan. After the market closed, Fuxingyong, Jinzhong, Qingfayong, Hengyu all bought and the market stabilized, rising to over 40 yuan. It was found that the highest price during the morning was 841.5 yuan, and the lowest price was 832 yuan, a difference of nine yuan. As a result, it rose slightly by 0.3 yuan compared to before the closure, but fell by more than 10 yuan compared to the previous day's grey market.</p>
<p>The closing price was a standard speculation price of 872.5 yuan for the Central Bank's gold, about 33 yuan higher than the closing price. It was less than 6 yuan higher than before the closure. The registered price for this month was 839 yuan, and the price for August was 839 yuan. The morning water supplement was 839 yuan. The price of pure gold was 7 yuan higher, at 846.2 yuan. The spot market has turned stable, but the willingness of both buyers and sellers is not very active. Tianjin goods were 10 yuan higher, but there were no transactions. Cooked pure gold was 12 yuan higher. Shanyingfengheng sold to the silversmiths at par. Other than that, the market was quiet. Swap deals were lower due to someone needing to collect cash. Duofangyuan gave Tongtaichang 14 credit notes for 2 yuan. Excluding public credit notes, 630 notes for this month remained, totaling 16 long positions and one short position.</p>
<p>In the market transactions, Hengchangyong, Yuanheng, Tongtaichang, Shenfeng, Fuxingyong, Shunmao, Dadecheng, Wanfeng, Dachangxiang, Dafayong, Yuanchangyong, Yuxinxiang, Deli, Yifengyong, etc., were mainly sellers. Yuanshengyong, Chunyuanyong, Fushengyong, Hengyu, Huixiang, Yifengyong, Qingpoyong, Yiyulichang, Richangxiangfeng, Yuanmaoyong, etc., were mainly buyers. Dadecheng, Fuxingyong, Hengxing, Zhongfeng, Changda, etc., were sellers first and then buyers. Hengchangyong, Wanfeng, Dada, Yuanmaoyong were buyers first and then sellers. The market transactions were chaotic, mainly because some of the over-the-counter transactions from the previous day needed to be transferred. Dashubang and Wanxing jointly made over 1,200 credit notes, with a slight profit after netting. Shunli jointly made over 200 credit notes, with a slight loss after netting. Guangbang Shengsheng was still quiet. Hengyu made 100 in and out each. The total number of transactions was 54,138 credit notes.</p>

<h3>Securities: Finance and Environment Overlap, Public Debt Falling Trend Intensifies</h3>
<p>—Disbandment bonds Plunge by Over Two Yuan—</p>
<p>Yesterday, the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, due to the deteriorating environment and the market suffering another severe blow, the falling trend started again. Almost all bonds experienced new lows. Although the financial sector and others pulled up the market at the close, slightly stabilizing it, it is feared that under the current environment of a hundred holes and incurable diseases, it will be difficult to have good development in the end. Looking at the market process in recent days, the market price has risen and fallen repeatedly. After a slight rebound, it eventually fell even further. This kind of situation is intensifying. Although it is caused by the environment, the control of finance has an even greater impact. The morning and afternoon sessions yesterday showed a gradual decline, but a falling trend was already hidden. There were some sales of the Fourteenth, Fourth, Thirtieth, Thirty-fourth, and Thirty-fifth bonds. Although the Forty-eighth, Seventy-eighth, and Eleventh bonds were absorbed, the overall sentiment was weak, and all bonds fell by about half a yuan. At the opening of the afternoon market, the selling side suddenly became strong, and the market suddenly became brewing, the human heart became more and more empty, and the falling trend was suddenly strong. Gold short-term bonds and others plunged by nearly one yuan. The close was even worse, with all the factions selling in droves. The disbandment bonds plunged by two yuan, and the 19 Customs bonds and others all fell by about one yuan. After that, it stabilized slightly, and the financial sector took the opportunity to raise and hold up the market, and the listed bonds rebounded by half a yuan. In total, the market price for the whole day fell by six or seven jiao to two yuan. The total number of transactions was about 35 million yuan. The comparison table showing the highs, lows, and degrees of fall is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>New York Silver Stocks Show Firmness Again</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Yanghang reported that yesterday (9th), the New York stock market was quite stable in the early morning, and silver stocks were especially firm. It was said that the United States maintained the London silver market. Later, due to long positions taking profits, prices fell. Speculators paid close attention to wheat, and because the crop had decayed, prices soared by four points. Bond markets fluctuated five times. Small exchange stocks rose. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Cotton Yarn This Month's Market Still Experiencing a Squeeze</h3>
<p>The cotton market's July futures are experiencing renewed upward pressure, with the market showing unique strength. This is primarily due to firm overseas markets for American and Indian cotton, leading to higher assessed prices. Consequently, new sellers are cautious. Moreover, poor cotton production conditions in Hunan, Hubei, and Shandong provinces contribute to a stable market atmosphere.</p>
<p>Futures Market Ends with Loosening</p>
<p>Before the opening of bidding, the near-month contracts were tight, with strong buying interest, driven by rising prices of American and Indian cotton. However, the distant-month contracts reportedly fell by over ten yuan, slightly dampening the market sentiment. As bidding progressed towards the closing, the widespread anticipation of a short squeeze in the current month led to a sudden jump of two jiao. Distant-month contracts also rose, resulting in overall increases ranging from one and a half to three jiao compared to the previous day's closing prices. At the afternoon opening, the current month's contracts remained tight and firm, with exceptionally thin trading volume in the market. By the second and third bidding rounds, the market began to loosen. Ultimately, the current month's contracts rose by five fen compared to the morning closing price, while the distant-month contracts fell by five fen. Reported sales included 1,300 dan of Dafu, 1,000 dan of Gengfeng, 3,600 dan of Run Kang, 1,200 dan of Jinchang, and 1,900 dan of Shenji. Purchases included 900 dan of Shenji, 2,700 dan of Yikang, 2,400 dan of Yuanxingchang, 3,100 dan of Weihe, 1,200 dan of Gengfeng, 600 dan of Ruid, and 700 dan of Xincheng. The daily high, low, and closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Futures Cotton  Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Compared to Previous Day Account Balance</p>
<p>July  31.50  32.15  31.45  Up 0.35  89,900</p>
<p>August 31.95  31.75  31.85  0.15  163,300</p>

<p>Total  581,000</p>
<p>Spot Cotton Sold in Small Quantities</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are moderate, with factories making small, continuous purchases without tearing. The source is reportedly 382 bales of Yao cotton.</p>

<h3>Futures Yarn Market Trading Dull</h3>
<p>The yarn market has returned to a state of calm, but most market participants have a unanimously bearish outlook on yarn futures, given the unfavorable environment and heavy pressure. However, foreign merchants have recently been buying at dips. Spot yarn sales are slow, and factory output has also decreased. The overseas cotton yarn market is stronger than before.</p>
<p>Slight Improvement at the Closing of Yarn Futures</p>
<p>The opening of the yarn futures market was still slow for near-month contracts. Capital pressure was severe, causing a drop of three to four jiao. However, there were fewer new buyers for the distant-month contracts. By the second and third bidding rounds, speculative sentiment rose again. Spot yarn transactions are reportedly sluggish, with very little trading activity in the market. As a result, all months fell by two, three, or four jiao compared to the previous day's closing prices. At the afternoon opening, prices showed signs of weakness, and both bulls and bears adopted a wait-and-see approach. However, there was no surge of sellers, and overseas yarn prices tended to be firm, with 20-count yarn rising by five jiao. By the close of the third session, market sentiment improved slightly. As a result, all months rose by one, two, three, or four jiao compared to the morning closing price. Reported sales included 300 bales of Jifeng, 1,200 bales of Dafu, 350 bales of Dachang, 250 bales of Yuanda, 250 bales of Yida, 200 bales of Yichang, 250 bales of Changyu, and 900 bales of Shenji. Purchases included 700 bales of Tongji, 400 bales of Suilong, 450 bales of Hengde, 450 bales of Shenji, 850 bales of Run Kang, and 300 bales of Xinhua. The daily high, low, and closing prices were as follows:</p>
<p>Futures Yarn  Highest Price  Lowest Price  Closing Price Increase/Decrease  Account Balance</p>
<p>July  160.5  160.0  160.3  Down 0.20 22,300</p>
<p>August 162.5  162.1  162.5  0.10  43,900</p>

<p>Total  197,650</p>
<p>Spot Yarn Japanese Yarn Up 5 Jiao</p>
<p>Spot yarn sales are slow. Daily statistics show that various native groups purchased a total of 429 bales. Japanese yarn transactions totaled over 200 bales, with Japanese yarn prices up 5 jiao. The purchase amounts by each group are as follows:</p>
<p>Inland 105 Ningbo 6 Haizhou 17</p>
<p>Guangdong 40 Wuhu 5 Yunnan 80</p>
<p>Henan 153 Shantou 10 Fujian 3</p>
<h3>Expanded Sales of Japanese Yarn in June</h3>
<p>In June, total exports and transshipments of cotton yarn from Chinese and Japanese factories in this city to various ports reached 54,293 bales, an increase of 893 bales compared to May. Chinese factory yarn accounted for 45,968 bales, a decrease of 905 bales compared to last month, while Japanese factory yarn accounted for 8,330 bales, an increase of 798 bales compared to last month.</p>
<p>American Cotton Industry Awaiting News of New Cotton Loans</p>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market opened calmly, with various months rising or falling by one to three points. Subsequently, spot merchants bought in, and traders bought near-term contracts at limited prices. New Orleans advanced due to strength in the Wheat Market, while Liverpool sold off distant-month contracts, causing prices to rebound. With limited deliveries and a dull market, traders are awaiting news of new cotton loans. The market closed firm, with spot prices rising by 10 points and futures rising by 11 to 13 points. Both spot and futures prices for English cotton rose by 8 points. The Indian cotton market was small, with balanced buying and selling. It rose later due to purchases by a few Japanese merchants. Bengale rose by 0.5 to 1.25 rupees, Oomra rose by 1.75 to 4.25 rupees, and Broach rose by 1.25 rupees. (Ninth Telegram)</p>

<h3>Grains Domestic Wheat Harvest Insufficient American Wheat Blotch Spreads Widely</h3>
<p>In the wheat market, prices rose sharply in the morning, with increases of 3, 5, or even 6 fen for various months. This was because foreign wheat prices had rebounded by one yuan, and the flood-affected areas had not yet returned to normal. This boosted confidence within and outside the industry. However, the market weakened again at noon, as foreign wheat was still priced cheaply. Whether for current needs or forward contracts, prices could be determined at any time, which reduced the buyer's interest. Buyers did not seem to pay attention to the seasonal factors, which is regrettable. As a result, the July contracts barely gained 1 fen, August fell by 1 fen, September fell by 1 fen, October remained unchanged, and November rose by 1 fen. The spot wheat market is slightly tight, and prices seem to have bottomed out. Although factory purchases are not strong, prices have not fallen significantly. Liuhe wheat opened at 3.33 yuan, Hushu wheat at 3.32 yuan (secondary at 3.30 yuan), and Hezhou Nanjing wheat at 3.27 yuan. Yangzhou wheat was at 3.35 yuan (secondary at 3.30 yuan), Jiangxinzhou wheat was at 3.35 yuan, Zhenjiang Puzhen wheat was at 3.30 yuan, Xiashu wheat was at 3.35 yuan, Zhumadian wheat was at 3.35 yuan, and Maiying wheat was at 3.22 yuan. Fuxin sold 5,000 bags, and Shenda and Xinda each sold 1,000 bags.</p>
<p>According to reports, the blotch disease on American wheat crops is spreading, but the exact losses will depend on the weather in the coming days. Spot prices are firm due to limited selling and scarce arrivals.</p>

<h3>Flour Often Made From Cheap Foreign Wheat</h3>
<p>The flour market continued its rebound yesterday, driven by sharp rises in foreign wheat quotes. Chicago wheat rose by about 1.23 to 1.24 yuan, and Canadian wheat rose by 0.08 to 0.20 yuan. Market sentiment was influenced by the continued severity of the Yangtze River floods and the recovery in overseas prices. As a result, buying interest was strong, and opening prices were raised by about 2 fen. However, domestic mills were actively selling forward contracts, and market sentiment returned to its former state, demonstrating how facts and environment often run contrary to each other. By the afternoon opening, trading became quiet again, and the market atmosphere weakened. Foreign wheat quotes are reportedly still low. Australian wheat in bags is only about 4.46 yuan, so the market's trend toward prosperity is being undermined by dumping. As a result, July and August contracts rose by 1 fen, September and October rose by 1.5 fen, November rose by 1.25 fen, and December rose by 1 fen.</p>
<h3>All Rice Sales are Flat</h3>
<p>Yesterday, rice sources from Shanghai South continued to arrive (about 5,000 shi of goods on the 26th and 27th). The market was even more sluggish because the weather had cleared up. City and rural stores made few purchases, and Qingdao and Yantai only purchased 200 to 300 bags. As a result, the prices of various thick japonica and thin indica rice continued to fall by 2 jiao. Yinyuan also fell by 5 fen to 1 jiao. Dujian were similar. Sixteen or seventeen ships from Hexia arrived in Shanghai North yesterday. Because few stores were listing, transactions of white japonica rice were limited, and prices were slightly lower by about 1 jiao. Early thin indica rice was also slow to sell, with market prices slightly lower by 1 to 2 jiao. While customer sentiment turned firm, weak demand caused prices to remain soft and sluggish. Other varieties also showed signs of weakness.</p>
<p>As for the foreign rice market, shipments from Hankou continued on the Yangtze River yesterday, although Jiujiang stopped temporarily. Currently, the disaster situation in various provinces along the Yangtze River is severe, with many farmlands flooded, and grain prices in various places have risen slightly. As a result, most people in the market are optimistic. However, customer demand was not strong yesterday. Some were loading stored rice for shipment, while others were unable to transport rice due to the heavy floods along the way. As a result, sales were limited. There was little inland trading within the street, while Nanjing and Ningbo merchants were active, turning the market to a balanced state. A total of 6,000 bags of Saigon rice and 1,000 bags each of small and large Siamese rice were offered, with prices similar to the previous market.</p>
<h3>Soybean Cake Spot Market Still Brisk</h3>
<p>Yesterday's soybean cake market was bolstered by clearing weather and successive telegrams of price increases. Additionally, the upcoming closure of the Wenzhou vessel led to a tight supply of spot cake. Prices rose by another four to five fen. Forward contracts and various custom-made cakes were also affected. A total of seven to eight thousand pieces of spot cake, over seven thousand pieces of forward contract cake, over one thousand pieces of brand cake, and over ten thousand pieces of various custom cakes were traded. Dealers from Liuxia, Dazhou, Taiwan, and Shantou are scrambling for spot cake, perhaps to avoid the post. Barring any unforeseen events, the trend will likely be sideways.</p>
<h3>Sundries The Price of Xu Kuizi Peanuts Rises by One Yuan</h3>
<p>The price of Xu Kuizi peanuts has been gradually tightening recently due to signs of a poor harvest in the production area. According to a telegram from Xuzhou yesterday, prices have risen by one yuan. The cost delivered to Shanghai is already above ten yuan, but the Shanghai market is still slow and temporarily unable to follow the price increase. The highest prices are only 9.23 yuan, which is still far from the cost. If demand increases, prices may follow suit.</p>
<h3>Miscellaneous News Shanghai People Consume Foreign Fruits Spend 2.58 Million Yuan Annually</h3>

<h3>Copying Books</h3>
<p>— Chen Zizhan</p>
<p>China has printed books, which roughly began in the Sui and Tang dynasties. The oldest printed books that can be found today are not earlier than the Tang dynasty. From the Huichang period of Emperor Wuzong of Tang to the Xiantong period of Emperor Yizong (around 850 AD), the trend of printing books using woodblocks became popular. At that time, books were printed in places such as Dongdu, Jiangdong, and Yizhou. Even as far as Dunhuang, it can be seen that printing books was already a common practice. From the late Tang dynasty to the Five Dynasties, even more people were involved in printing books. In the third year of Changxing during the Later Tang dynasty (932 AD), the Imperial Academy engraved the Nine Classics based on the characters of the Stone Classics. This was the beginning of official editions. Because large-scale books could not be produced without official power, the Imperial Academy later widely engraved various books for this reason. Before the Later Tang engraved the Classics, a descendant of the Mu family engraved books such as the Selections of Literature and the Record of Learning in Shu, suggesting that there were more engravers in Shu than elsewhere. In recent years, when the Leifeng Pagoda in West Lake collapsed, it was discovered that it contained scriptures engraved during the Wu-Yue period, indicating that books were also engraved in Zhejiang at that time, or perhaps there were more secret books engraved than just these few. Some historians say that the engraving of books started with Feng Dao alone in the Five Dynasties, which is not very accurate.</p>
<p>We should also know that before there were printed books, there was already the practice of engraving characters, but they were not printed into books or rubbed into ink copies. Some people say that at the beginning of the creation of writing, it was called “shuqi,” with writing being called “shu” and engraving being called “qi.” Based on the oldest existing written relics that can be found today, it is possible that engraving characters predates writing. If Zou Hanxun's Interpretation of the Hongjue Stele can be believed, then China had stone carvings more than a thousand years before Christ. The tortoise shells and bones discovered in modern times are all inscriptions from the Yin-Shang period. The exquisiteness of the inscriptions is difficult for modern people to match, indicating that oracle bone script was a more advanced form of engraving and not the work of primitive people. Other examples include inscriptions on Shang bronzes, Zhou tripods, Qin weights, Han seals, wooden tablets from the tomb of the King of Nanyue in the Western Han dynasty, stone carvings of the Classics written in the Later Han and Three Kingdoms periods, and pottery inscriptions on tiles and bricks, all belonging to engraved characters and representing the beginning of engraving books. However, the era when readable printed books truly emerged started with the Tang dynasty.</p>
<p>Although printed books gradually appeared during the Sui, Tang, and Five Dynasties periods, not all books had printed versions, nor were printed books available for sale everywhere. Copying books by hand was still very popular. More than thirty years ago, handwritten copies from the Six Dynasties and Tang dynasties were discovered in the Dunhuang cave. The oldest handwritten copies of ancient books that we see today are those written by people from the Six Dynasties and Sui-Tang dynasties. Because books did not have printed versions, copying books became a necessary task for scholars at that time. No wonder the scholars and officials of the Six Dynasties liked to copy books, which became a trend. Of course, the circulation of books at that time relied on copying, and the prevalence of parallelism, which emphasized allusions and literary embellishments, also relied on copying to help with memorization. Now, I will transcribe some stories about copying books from the History of the Southern Dynasties. Those of us who have printed books to read should also see how diligent and hardworking people who wanted to read in the era when only handwritten books were available were. The Biography of Wang Jun in the History of the Southern Dynasties (Volume 22) contains Wang Jun's preface:</p>
<p>I have loved copying books since I was young, and this love has become even stronger as I have grown old. Even when I catch a glimpse of something, I immediately write it down. When I review it later, my joy and excitement are even deeper. This habit has become part of my nature, and I do not feel tired of writing. From the age of thirteen or fourteen in the second year of Jianwu (Yi Hai year) to the sixth year of Datong in the Liang dynasty, it has been forty years. In my youth, I read the Five Classics seventy or eighty times each. I loved the Zuo Commentary on the Spring and Autumn Annals, and reciting it was a common practice. I broadly extracted and selected from it three times and copied it five times. I also copied the other Classics, Zhou Li, Yi Li, Guo Yu, Erya, Shan Hai Jing, and Ben Cao, once each. I copied all the collections of Masters and Histories once. I have never asked anyone to do it for me, but have always copied them myself, totaling over a hundred volumes. This is not something worth boasting about, but it is to prevent forgetting.</p>
<p>Wang Jun's lifelong career was copying books. He stated the reasons for copying books: one was interest, because "reviewing it later, my joy and excitement are even deeper"; and the other was memorization, because "to prevent forgetting." His nephew Wang Tai also liked copying books. He was studious in his youth, and he personally copied over two thousand volumes. The Biography of Qi Imperial Clan Member Hengyang Prince Wang Daodu's Adopted Son Jun in the History of the Southern Dynasties (Volume 41) states:</p>
<p>Jun often wrote in fine script himself and copied the Five Classics, dividing them into one volume each, and placing them in his handkerchief box to prevent forgetting. The lecturer He Jie asked, "Your Highness's family already has a large number of books. Why do you need to write such fine script and hide them in your handkerchief box?" He replied, "The Five Classics are in the handkerchief box, which makes it easy to inspect and review. Furthermore, by writing them myself, I will never forget them." When the princes heard this, they all imitated him and created handkerchief box Five Classics. The handkerchief box Five Classics originated from this.</p>
<p>In the study of book editions, small books are called "handkerchief box editions," which is due to Qi Hengyang Prince Wang Jun's handkerchief box Five Classics. The advantage of this type of book is that it is small, easy to carry, and can be reviewed at any time "to prevent forgetting." Since the Song dynasty, scholars taking the imperial examinations have carried books of the "essential readings for exams," which were all handkerchief box editions. According to Dai Zhi's "Gupu" in the Wei dynasty:</p>
<p>Today, handkerchief box editions are available for everything. During the Jiading period, the scholar Yang Lin made a memorial to ban small woodblocks. Recently, they have become popular again. Carrying books is not only for storing them in a handkerchief box.</p>
<p>It turns out that in the era of the imperial examinations, scholars needed to carry books with them, so handkerchief box editions became particularly popular. Because these books could be hidden in sleeves, they were also called "pocket editions." The Biography of Zhang Mian in the History of the Southern Dynasties (Volume 56) states:</p>
<p>Mian copied the Later Han and Jin Histories, copying thirty volumes. He also copied the Jiangzuo Collection, but did not finish it.</p>
<p>The Biography of Zhang Zuan states:</p>
<p>In his later years, he accumulated a considerable collection, mostly copied books, numbering tens of thousands of volumes.</p>
<p>It can be seen that the Zhang brothers were also diligent in copying books. The Biography of Yuan Jun in the History of the Southern Dynasties (Volume 72) Literature states:</p>
<p>He was orphaned early and determined to study hard. Because his family was poor and had no books, he always borrowed books from others and copied them all. He set a daily quota of fifty sheets of paper, and would not stop if he did not reach that number.</p>
<p>This Mr. Yuan had to borrow books from others because his family was poor and had no books. Since he could not return the borrowed books, he had to copy them all. He limited himself to writing fifty sheets of paper a day. Alas! Aspiring people endure much hardship. He worked so hard.</p>
<p>The above stories about copying books all belong to the Southern Dynasties. At the same time, in the Northern Dynasties, scholars also liked to copy books. The Biography of Mu Chong in the History of the Northern Dynasties (Volume 20) states:</p>
<p>(Mu) Zirong was fond of learning from a young age and read everything. He sought books from all over the world and copied them whenever he found them, obtaining over ten thousand volumes.</p>
<p>The same book (Volume 24), Biography of Cui Zhi states:</p>
<p>(Cui Min, also known as) Changqian was a writing assistant with Wang Yanye of Taiyuan in his youth, overseeing the collation of books. Later, he became the magistrate of Qingzhou. During a siege of the city that lasted two hundred days, Changqian continued to read books and personally copied over eight thousand sheets of paper.</p>
<p>The same book (Volume 38), Biography of Pei Han states:</p>
<p>Whenever he borrowed rare books from others, he would personally make copies. Even when he was sick for years, he never stopped reading.</p>
<p>The same book (Volume 64), Biography of Zhang Fan states:</p>
<p>He loved literature and history from a young age and devoted himself to writing. He personally copied hundreds of thousands of words.</p>
<p>The several people mentioned above, some copied books even when they were sick, and some did not stop copying books during a siege. It seems that they valued copying books more than their own lives, which cannot be denied as a unique trend among scholars of the Northern and Southern Dynasties. The reason for this trend, of course, is as I said at the beginning of this article: "The circulation of books at that time relied on copying, and the prevalence of parallelism, which emphasized allusions and literary embellishments, also relied on copying to help with memorization." Moreover, in the society of that era, scholars and officials generally led leisurely and carefree lives, and writing and copying books was an elegant form of entertainment!</p>
<p>During the Song and Yuan dynasties, printed books became popular, and the number of handwritten books gradually decreased. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, large-scale official books, such as the Yongle Encyclopedia and the Siku Quanshu, were all handwritten copies, with no printed versions. To this day, collectors still value exquisitely copied books as much as Song and Yuan printed books, indicating that handwritten books still have their own reasons for existence. As for modern writings, eight or nine out of ten are copied by the authors themselves. Of course, there are currently writers who hire scribes or use typewriters, but very few people copy books that already have printed versions, unless it is for summarizing or excerpting.</p>
<h3>Phantom Dreams</h3>
<p>— Duan Weidai</p>
<p>The sky was not yet bright.</p>
<p>The wind blew, making the paper window rattle all night long.</p>
<p>The pillow was hard, pieced together from several threadbare cloth-covered books.</p>
<p>Poverty made me more meticulous, more anxious, and made me think of things I couldn't help but resent. I hit the bed hard with my fist, threw aside the book in my hand, and reluctantly closed my weary eyes, which had been open for most of the night.</p>
<p>The electric light still burned with a dim yellow glow.</p>
<p>In my heart, I repeatedly thought about how I should blame my cousin for telling me this unpleasant thing.</p>
<p>However, the dawn rooster was crowing, as if warning those indulging in sentimental tasks that tomorrow's cruel reality was still waiting for you, wearing a ghostly face!</p>
<p>I walked into a small street in a daze.</p>
<p>This street was filthy, narrow, dark, and completely in the tone of my hometown's small town.</p>
<p>A young man, Gongrun, walked up to me.</p>
<p>"Where are you going, Mingqing?" Suddenly, a hand with only stubble, cold, tightly grabbed my arm.</p>
<p>I suddenly faced this short, thin, and wiry man, unable to say half a word, only secretly imagining:</p>
<p>—Isn't he already a dead person, a ghost?</p>
<p>However, I was finally too embarrassed to say it, just staring at his unshaven short beard on his face, and a greasy light grey serge hunting suit.</p>
<p>"Come to my place!" His eyes, emitting a blue flame, stared intently at my face.</p>
<p>So, my legs involuntarily followed him to such a place—a large broken plank door, high black walls on all sides, several old dogs, the room cold and desolate, with no good-looking decorations, exuding a damp, musty smell, not much different from this man's usual residence, I secretly sized it up.</p>
<p>He spoke to me from the shadows:</p>
<p>"Look, I ended up like this... Alas!" His voice contained infinite regret: "I was really taken care of by them like this! But, alas, what a pity! The year before last, I got so many people, following me, without food, wanting to do something, but I didn't let them run wild, because we are all children from good families, how can we rob people, become bandits, disturb the farmers working on their own land!"</p>
<p>"Yes."</p>
<p>I simply didn't know what pleasant words to use to respond.</p>
<p>"Think about it, two years have passed, and they put such a hat on me, bandit... Alas, damn it, spending money to buy life, where did so much tough stuff come from!... Alas!"</p>
<p>He rubbed his hands together, his fingers cracking, a handful of gun bullets.</p>
<p>I knew that the flames of anger were burning in his heart, and I was still very clumsy, just staring at his mouth, unable to say a decent word of comfort to this man who had been ruined by history.</p>
<p>"Alas!" I clenched my teeth and groaned.</p>
<p>A very rusty hunting gun was tightly held in his thin fist, suddenly discovered by me.</p>
<p>I knew that he was harboring a kind of indescribable sadness, like Xiang Yu blaming himself when he unsheathed his sword at Wujiang, why didn't he strike earlier to eliminate his opponents!</p>
<p>Revenge—these two words seemed to occupy his entire heart at this moment.</p>
<p>I was very guilty, restrained, and uneasy, looking at that old-fashioned, rusty hunting gun.</p>
<p>The dog wagging its tail plunged us completely into contemplation.</p>
<p>"Creak!"—The door of my bedroom rang.</p>
<p>My cousin dragged his slippers and sat in my chair, coldly looking at my mosquito net.</p>
<p>I had no choice but to wake up again, looking at this living figure worn down by hunger and cold.</p>
<p>However, the shadow of the tragically deceased young people of my hometown was still very clearly reflected in my heart.</p>
<p>For the sake of survival, I cannot stand still and commemorate these good people who have fallen into traps, I can only open my eyes and walk the path I should walk today.</p>
<h3>Klang, Malaysia</h3>
<p>— Liu Ming</p>
<p>One of the Records of Returning from the Southern Lands</p>
<p>When I first woke up in the morning, I smelled the scent of leaves and mud mixed together from the land. I quickly got up to look and saw that our ship had already entered the harbor. The tropical forests on both banks, sleeping in the morning light, were all soaked in a light green, slightly yellow tide, as if they were growing in the water. The trees in the forest were not very tall, all short, but very dense. It seemed that it would not be easy for things like hunting dogs to get in—the scenery was all fresh and wild, and the harbor was not adorned with markers indicating the navigation route, and there were no small boats coming and going, almost making people suspect that the ship had sailed to a large island inhabited by no one.</p>
<p>A Burmese woman sat on the deck combing her hair, pushing the sleeping Chinese old man with her hand, asking what place we had arrived at.</p>
<p>The old man propped himself up halfway with his elbow, rubbing his blurry eyes as he looked towards the shore, muttering to himself in a mix of Xiamen dialect and Burmese:</p>
<p>"Gu Lai Po... Mo He Bu... Mo He Bu..." (Singapore... Not... Not)</p>
<p>A Cantonese sailor was tidying up the long rope used to calculate nautical miles, which was hanging on the stern of the ship, answering someone's question in the accent of Taishan.</p>
<p>"...It was a telegram sent yesterday... Shouldn't we have arrived in Singapore? Diu Kong Ma Ge Hai!...</p>
<p>At this time, a pockmarked young man, clutching a wet towel, walked up from the deck, glancing at the old man with a strange look, making a threatening expression, and said:</p>
<p>"It's over! Old man, it's over!"</p>
<p>The old man was about to inquire about the news in the telegram, but he was startled by the sudden scare from the pockmarked young man, and asked in surprise:</p>
<p>"What matter?"</p>
<p>"What matter??... You know your own business best."</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man made a ghostly gesture, twisting his mouth. He then turned around nimbly, grabbed the towel, then opened it and placed it on a bundle, humming a pleased tune.</p>
<p>The old man sat up, buttoning his clothes, and replied maliciously:</p>
<p>"Is it about me?... You can't escape either!"</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man quickly turned around, clenched his hands, raised them to his chest, and shook them, making a metallic sound, and said:</p>
<p>"Me?... Two fists and one mouth!... What's there to be afraid of?"</p>
<p>A middle-aged fat merchant, wearing a white short shirt with the buttons undone, walked up, puffing out his thick chest. Seeing the pockmarked young man acting so strangely, he frowned and then, as if pleased that he knew something first, said loudly:</p>
<p>"Everyone, do you know why the ship is sailing here?"</p>
<p>After looking at everyone's faces with satisfaction, he leaned his back against the ship's railing and continued.</p>
<p>"Yesterday, I heard friends from the first and second class cabins say that the ship is sailing here because of a prisoner. Yesterday, the Malaysian Federal Government even sent a telegram to the Penang government!"</p>
<p>When he said the word "prisoner," he glanced at the old man and the pockmarked young man, and when he finished speaking, he especially asked the old man in a shrill voice:</p>
<p>"Old man, let me ask you, have you committed a crime in Kuala Lumpur?"</p>
<p>The old man's thin face flushed slightly, and he retorted angrily:</p>
<p>"That's strange! What crime have I committed?"</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man poked his mouth at the old man, squinting his eyes, and mocked:</p>
<p>"You're lying! Haven't you committed a crime?... Hmph, I saw it with my own eyes!"</p>
<p>The old man got angry, slapped his side, and cursed:</p>
<p>"Get the hell out of here, what have you seen with your own eyes?"</p>
<p>The pockmarked young man kept smiling cheekily.</p>
<p>"Heh, heh, don't deny it!... I saw it with my own eyes, you stepped on the red-haired devil's tail in the streets of Kuala Lumpur!"</p>
<p>Everyone laughed. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>A Heart</h3>
<p>— Lü Shaoguang</p>
<p>Strings of days,</p>
<p>Swiftly, slipped past the edge of dreams, — silently.</p>
<p>A young heart, branded with</p>
<p>the brand of life;</p>
<p>A depressed shadow,</p>
<p>like a gloomy dusk on a rainy day!</p>
<p>"Spring has gone, and summer has come!"</p>
<p>A sorrowful sigh,</p>
<p>Climbs the declining brow,</p>
<p>Now, I deeply understand life!</p>
<p>Not a false lie,</p>
<p>Or a frivolous absurdity,</p>
<p>A heart, always trembling,</p>
<p>As if for what?</p>
<p>Ah, for what!</p>
<h3>University Days (21)</h3>
<p>— by German author Storm, translated by Chen Yinzhi</p>
<p>The blurry sound of the accordion and the clamorous noise of the annual market reached our ears from outside the garden.</p>
<p>In front of us, looking out from the end of the shaded path, there was still a small patch of golden sunset that had not yet disappeared in the unreachable distance. I clasped her hand in my arm and held it again.</p>
<p>Just at this moment, something suddenly ran across the road in front of us, perhaps a hedgehog coming out to catch mice. — She was slightly startled and leaned closer to me; I put my arm around her waist almost unintentionally; I felt her small head slide onto my shoulder.</p>
<p>Then, quickly, for only a second, the lips of the two people touched, — we walked out of the shaded trees into the open space like fools.</p>
<p>We walked like this, I still holding her hand, and soon we reached the end of the road, passed through a garden gate, and walked onto a country path; this path led to the last few houses of the city from the side.</p>
<p>We walked quickly side by side, as if eager for this meeting to end soon.</p>
<p>"My father will come looking for me; it's really too late!" Nali said, not raising her head.</p>
<p>"I think so too!" I replied. We walked even faster than before.</p>
<p>We were already standing at the end of the path, facing the last few houses on the street. The light from the window of the tailor's shop under the bodhi tree shone on a little girl standing by the well not far from me; I certainly could not move forward. But when Nali stepped onto the stone road on the street, I suddenly realized that I should not let her leave me like this.</p>
<p>"Nali," I said dazedly, "I still have something to say to you."</p>
<p>She took a step back. "What?" she asked.</p>
<p>"Wait a little longer!"</p>
<p>She turned back and stood quietly in front of me. I heard how she stroked her hair with her hand and tightened the red cloth on her head; but for a long time, I could not clear up the chaotic thoughts, which were swaying before my eyes like a misty smoke. "Nali," I said finally, "Do you still resent me now?"</p>
<p>She lowered her eyes to the ground and shook her head.</p>
<p>"Will you come here again tomorrow, okay?"</p>
<p>She hesitated for a moment. "I don't usually go out in the evening," she said later.</p>
<p>"Nali, you're lying: that's not it; tell me the truth!"</p>
<p>I went to grab her hand, but she pulled it away.</p>
<p>"Speak, Nali!—You won't say it?"</p>
<p>She stood silently in front of me for a while, then raised her head and looked at me. "I know," she said softly, "you will only marry those pretty ladies."</p>
<p>I could not answer a word. This truth was something I had not expected; I had never thought about such a big thing, and I did not know how to answer this question.</p>

<h3>National Prisons Suffer from Overcrowding</h3>
<p>— Xing An</p>
<p>The increasing acuteness of the economic depression and the surge in criminal cases in society are a predictable phenomenon. According to a recent investigation by the Prison Department of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the number of prisoners at the end of the 23rd year increased by 34% in Jiangsu Province, 8.5% in Zhejiang Province, 26.8% in Shanxi Province, and 32.4% in Anhui Province compared to the end of the previous year. Calculated based on the average increase in prisoner numbers in the above four provinces, the number has increased by 20% within one year. The remaining provinces can be inferred similarly. Following this trend, the number of prisoners nationwide will inevitably double in four or five years. This is very noteworthy. Furthermore, according to the assessment of the fixed number of new prisons, it is said that the number exceeding the prescribed number has also been more than doubled, and there is a serious problem of overcrowding. This is even more concerning.</p>
<p>The judicial authorities, aware of this, deeply believe that prisons with limited capacity are detaining an ever-increasing number of criminals. Management and supplies are already difficult, and reform policies cannot be thoroughly implemented. Moreover, with too many criminals, mutual contact can easily lead to the acquisition of bad habits, and prisoners living together are also prone to epidemics. Therefore, as a remedy, now that the summer vacation has arrived, the method of reducing sentences will be implemented according to law to relieve the overcrowding of prisoners. It is said that the provisions of the sentence reduction method stipulate that only those who have been sentenced to a fixed term of imprisonment for more than one-third of their term and whose behavior has improved and have skills are considered qualified.</p>
<p>The facilities of prisons in various parts of our country are extremely simple and inadequate. The dark situation of old-style prisons has long been witnessed by all. Even a few new-style prisons inevitably still have many shortcomings. This gives the prisoners who are imprisoned for crimes very deep pain. And now, due to the surge in the number of criminals nationwide, prisons in various places have to accommodate more than double the fixed number of prisoners, resulting in the above-mentioned inconveniences and malpractices. The suffering experienced by the prisoners is even more indescribable. Therefore, we believe that the judicial authorities' method of reducing sentences is a matter of urgent importance.</p>
<p>However, in addition to reducing criminals and reducing sentences, there are also two items: probation and parole. However, this is just a stopgap measure. The fundamental solution requires political integrity, social stability, economic prosperity, and universal education, and criminal events can be prevented. Therefore, we hope that the government authorities, in addition to reducing the number of criminals from a negative perspective, should also improve the environment in which people commit crimes from a positive perspective. As for the improvement of old and new-style prisons in various places, the increase of prisons, and the improvement of the treatment of prisoners, these are also not to be ignored. Cheng Quan</p>
<h3>Locusts</h3>
<p>— Cheng Quan</p>
<p>Someone from my hometown came and talked about the affairs of the fields, shaking his head, squinting his eyes, and several deep and black stripes appeared on his forehead, saying: "Alas, as I said, farmers don't know what sins they have committed. The affairs of the fields will never be done well in a lifetime. Last year was a year of famine, and we managed to get through it by dying. We were eagerly looking forward to this year! Ha, this year! There was a drought in the rice seedling season, and now there is a locust plague; it looks like most of this year's harvest is already gone, and this year is almost over again."</p>
<p>As he spoke, he sank into silence—perhaps already imagining the tragedies of hanging and drowning in the winter of this year, which will repeat last year—this scene is too terrible to imagine. As soon as you think about it, it's like falling into an ice cave, and a burst of piercing cold air washes over your body, making you shiver.</p>
<p>And, as if unwilling to give up this terrible idea, he paused for a while and continued to talk about this topic—</p>
<p>"Alas, there's really no way: it's a natural disaster! Thinking about it, it's not without reason. Last winter, there was no good snowfall, and there was no proper cold day. In this way, the insects in the field will not freeze to death, so how can this year's insect plague not be severe? Alas, I said that even the old man in the sky is wrong in this world: it's not cold when it should be cold; it's not hot when it should be hot; the days are lived upside down, and it's no wonder that the world is in a mess."</p>
<p>Speaking of locusts, that terrible scene can still be described to this day, which is really not easy to forget.</p>
<p>Although, it has been more than ten years since then, I was still young at that time, living with my adults in the countryside, reciting five pages of Zuo Zhuan with the old teacher in the private school every day, and helping with some small farming things when I was free. That year, it was also the early summer season, and a locust plague broke out in the village, eating up the fresh rice heads. The villagers lived through a year of "half-starved."</p>
<p>At first, it was like this: it was only a few days after the Dragon Boat Festival, and people nearby found a soil-yellow insect in the rice fields that looked like a grasshopper, and immediately recognized it: it was a locust! This shock was really no small matter, so they immediately shouted it out. The villagers were all anxious, but there was no other way. They had to follow the elders' words and go to the Land Temple in the town to ask the locust god, and promised a stage play as a wish. Everyone also kowtowed.</p>
<p>But in less than three days, one afternoon, there was a noisy "squeak" sound in the sky. People looked up and saw that locusts had really come. Thousands and thousands gathered in a large group, flying in the sky like a dark cloud, even covering a large area of sunlight, which could be seen on the ground: it looked like a black shadow floating. The villagers were flustered: some hurriedly bought firecrackers to set off towards the sky, some ran to the locust god to kowtow and make wishes (they believed that the locusts were managed by a god), and some were anxious and crying at home; but, what's the use of these? In less than a month, the rice heads in the fields were eaten by seventy to eighty percent, and the rice stalks turned yellow and fell down! And the hard work, hope, and source of life of a village in a year were also interrupted together in this panic and helpless situation!</p>
<p>That winter, the villagers had to use beans and wheat bran to fill their hunger; a new year passed in silence. No one made cakes or dumplings, and there were no stage plays or lantern festivals.</p>
<p>This dangerous and terrible scene remains in my memory, and it has been nearly twenty years now. Hearing that there is another locust plague in my hometown this year, I asked someone from my hometown, and they said that they are still only going to the Land Temple in the town to kowtow and make wishes—besides this, what else can they do? Saying, "It's a natural disaster!"</p>
<p>Thinking of this, I really dare not think any further.</p>

<h3>Village Affairs</h3>
<p>— Cun Yin</p>
<p>The gentle breeze of the clear night, like sunlight, passed through a lonely small village. There, the young men and women in the village were sitting brightly in the melancholy moonlight. Most of the old men and women had already lain on the dark grey beds and were snoring loudly.</p>
<p>What we are familiar with is the generation of farmers in A-Sheng's family. Their accents are completely pure country dialect. A-Sheng's only son, although he had studied in a nearby small town for half a year, his systematic accent was still completely unchanged.</p>
<p>These days, the people in the village, whether in the fields or under the eaves, would talk about A-Sheng's son whenever they were free.</p>
<p>"In three days, Little A-Sheng can hug a beautiful little bride."</p>
<p>"Little A-Sheng's generation is very quiet, only him alone."</p>
<p>"Yes, so he's getting married so early."</p>
<p>What we can hear is nothing more than news about Little A-Sheng getting married. Moreover, even Little A-Sheng himself would sometimes secretly talk to his good friends in the fields about getting married.</p>
<p>Now, gently swaying in the moonlight is the cool breeze of early summer, and spreading far in the cool breeze is the discussion of Little A-Sheng's marriage.</p>
<p>Among them, Li Sheng, who is as strong as a wild boar, talked the most vigorously. He opened his two round eyes, wiped the sweat on his nose, and said:</p>
<p>"I guess Little A-Sheng will definitely become a lustful ghost!" He said with a jealous tone, unable to get rid of his wild boar appearance. Yes, if you were Li Sheng, you might be even more displeased with the fact that Little A-Sheng is getting married at the age of seventeen. Because Li Sheng is now thirty-one years old and has not yet married a wife, and even matchmakers have not visited his home. He likes to hear stories about women, especially paying attention to the pictures of pretty girls brought from the city.</p>
<p>"If I had also gone to town to study for half a year, after returning home, I'm afraid someone would have come to propose marriage to me."</p>
<p>After he said this, he made everyone sitting around him laugh. They all opened their mouths and laughed at a pitifully stupid wild boar in this dark night.</p>
<p>"Marrying a wife at seventeen will definitely lead to an early death!" In the laughter, he coarsely cursed as if swearing.</p>
<p>"Are you crazy? Li Sheng." A-Kang, who was sitting next to him and had lost one eye, endured his laughter and seriously asked him.</p>
<p>"One-eyed dragon! Tell me, isn't this too ridiculous?—I have always worked hard and been honest, and I don't even like to read half a word, but such an honest person doesn't have a wife, but that glib little guy is going to marry a wife before me." So many words made Li Sheng laugh again.</p>
<p>"Li Sheng, don't be nosy. Think about it yourself: A-Sheng's family is richer than yours!" A-Kang yawned.</p>
<p>"Yes, doesn't A-Sheng's family know the landlord Huang? Oh, right, wasn't it them who forced us to hand over the landlord Huang's rent last year?" He laughed as if he suddenly understood.</p>
<p>"A-Sheng's family is a generation of old farmers, so the landlord trusts them?" Another person interjected.</p>
<p>"Pah, they are a generation of people who know how to flatter! So the landlord will trust them." Li Sheng said coarsely, almost making his head explode.</p>
<p>"Calm down and go to sleep. They are more patient than us. They go back and drink the landlord's foot-washing water, so they get a little convenience. But, aren't they just like us?" A-Kang carried his small bamboo chair, speaking as he walked away.</p>
<p>"But they have wives! What do you say about that?" Li Sheng was even more annoyed. The moon laughed at him, and A-Kang laughed at him.</p>
<p>The cool breeze of the clear night tried its best to blow away Li Sheng's annoyance.</p>
<p>And Little A-Sheng was carrying a large package of things back from town.</p>
<p>"Landlord Huang gave Little A-Sheng a large package of silk and satin."</p>
<p>So this envious news spread throughout the entire village in no time before dawn.</p>
<h3>Small Scene of Mandarin Duck Lake</h3>
<p>— Shi Ying</p>
<p>The past memories are like a dream, like the lake water in a dream, flashing and shaking, not letting you grasp them. Before my eyes is Mandarin Duck Lake, light blue and calm. In this light of water and shadows of clouds, her youth is gradually fading away, like a flower with unbound feet. She sighs, gazing at the shimmering lake waves.</p>
<p>She is the boat girl of Mandarin Duck Lake, wandering every day at the green willow pier, ferrying boats back and forth in the lake. She doesn't understand what the tourists who play in Mandarin Duck Lake find interesting. They sit in the small boat, holding lit cigarettes, leisurely watching the unfolding waves outside the boat. In the distance are the green banks, the green suburbs. The Misty Rain Pavilion in the lake seems to be submerged in the water. The green willows are fluffy, like a fairy's cloud-like hair, reflecting the red walls and verdant willows, the small bridges and flowing water, the lonely water pier, paved with ancient stone steps, appearing unusually tidy. She softly asks the tourists if they want to go to the Misty Rain Pavilion to play. The tourists nod as if they do or do not, but their eyes are looking at her, standing at the bow of the boat poling, at her light and beautiful figure. The boat finally stops at the Misty Rain Pavilion. She lets them onto the island shore, and she stands by the water waiting for them. The tourists leisurely sit upstairs, perhaps drinking tea for an hour or two. She looks at the lake surface, at the emerald green water chestnut marshes, at the children picking South Lake water chestnuts, dazed for an hour or two.</p>
<p>In the past, she was also a child, an innocent little girl from a farming family. For her parents' hunger and cold, she was sold to the mistress of the Mandarin Duck Lake tourist boats. In Mandarin Duck Lake, there were dozens of such girls. When she was young, she couldn't sell her smile yet, so she followed her companions, standing beside the fiery Xuan Gong oranges. In the June weather, the sun made them dizzy, and sweat soaked their thin clothes. They waved their palm-leaf fans while searching for tourists with pitiful, tired eyes. She painstakingly saw a man and hurried to follow behind him: "Want a boat ride? Want to play in South Lake?" The man walked on without hearing or seeing. She followed behind him: "Do you want a boat ride?" Murmuring, panting, following, the sun baking the sweat on her thin face, the dry dust on the road rising up and sticking to her face. Her small hand wiped her face, still murmuring and panting as she followed. Until completely despairing, she retreated, grumbling in her mouth. In the erosion of wind and rain, in the tiring water life, in the "Want a boat ride?" sound, her childhood passed, and she grew into a flower-like girl: she learned rough laughter and delicate greetings. She used her smile to attract tourists, decorating the peaceful lake, passing the blurred days.</p>
<p>The busiest time of the year is only in late summer and early autumn. She stands at the bow of the boat, smoking inferior paper cigarettes, gazing at the emerald green water chestnut marshes. South Lake water chestnuts are on the market, and the Misty Rain Pavilion is more lively. She carries guests back and forth in the familiar lake water. Everything is beautiful. Sometimes it is a moonlit night, Mandarin Duck Lake shrouded in a light dream, the lake surface floating with the fragrance of newly opened osmanthus flowers. She responds to the teasing of the tourists, happily narrating stories of the lake, her voice like a silver bell. — In the intoxication of the tourists, she gets tomorrow's food.</p>
<p>But autumn is almost over, and the tourists on Mandarin Duck Lake are becoming scarce. Like the branches of a tree with falling yellow leaves, Mandarin Duck Lake is becoming more and more deserted day by day. She sits at the bow of the boat, gazing at the empty and calm Mandarin Duck Lake surface. South Lake water chestnuts are past, and the lake surface only has some leaves left from the harvest, one by one, drifting east and west with the ripples. In the future, they will naturally sink to the bottom of the water. She reminisces about the past, looking at the desolate wilderness, looking at the water chestnut leaves rolling in the lake waves, and unknowingly a sense of sadness ripples in her heart. She says to herself in a low voice: "Harvested water chestnut leaves, drifting east and west, is this the eternal future?..."</p>

<h3>Evidence Should Be Available for Monetary Transactions</h3>
<p>Editor:</p>
<p>Four years ago, I had a friend who opened a foreign goods store. I invested all my savings of one thousand yuan in this store, but the amount was too small, so it was attached to the name of the manager (who is my friend) as half a share. At that time, because the manager and I were very good friends, I did not obtain any shares. At the same time, he also allowed me to work in the store, so I thought I had nothing to fear. Unexpectedly, recently, due to a conflict of opinions with the manager, an argument broke out, and he dismissed me from my position. And because of the livelihood of my family, I wanted to withdraw the one thousand yuan of capital and seek another way of life. Who knew that he would say that I did not have shares at the time and vehemently denied that I was a shareholder, so everyone had a very stiff relationship. I now want to sue in court, but without shares, I don't know if the future is promising? Is there another way to get back this sum of money? I earnestly ask you to think of a way for me, otherwise the lives of my family will have no hope! Sincerely,</p>
<p>Guo Taiyuan respectfully</p>
<p>Editor's note: Mr. Guo invested all his savings in someone else, and did not obtain evidence at the time, which was too careless. He trusted people too much. Although he is your "very good friend," and although he allowed you to work in his store, the procedures should not have been so neglected. Current law emphasizes evidence, and this matter is indeed a bit difficult. However, the evidence presented in law is not limited to contracts with signatures and seals. Other things, if there are sufficient reasons, can also be used as strong evidence. If Mr. Guo had a receipt or return slip from the manager when he made the payment, or if there was a record of this sum of money in the capital account of the business, or if in the past his letters contained statements acknowledging the share money, and also, if in the past he paid dividends to you? If there is physical evidence acknowledging the shares when paying, you can rely on them to prosecute. Without physical evidence, human testimony is also possible, for example, was there anyone else present to prove the payment? However, human testimony is not as powerful as physical evidence. We think that a thousand yuan is not a small amount, and there must be some evidence. If Mr. Guo has sufficient evidence, then a legal prosecution has a hopeful prospect.</p>

<p>Cuckoo Song</p>
<p>Cuckoo, cuckoo, urging early and rushing late, if you don't sow in spring, you won't harvest in autumn. Cuckoo, cuckoo, rain and wind, scorching sun every day, crawling in the fields,</p>
<p>Cuckoo, cuckoo, seeking early and watching late, sowing one sheng in spring, harvesting one hu in autumn. Cuckoo, cuckoo, for the sake of food, only seeking warmth and fullness, not seeking happiness.</p>
<p>(Chorus) Cuckoo, cuckoo, busy early and working late, farmers are busy, landlords enjoy. Landlords eat meat, farmers eat porridge.</p>
<p>Children's Year Song</p>
<p>Children's Year, Children's Year, is our children's happy year, Children's Year, this is Children's Year, is our national Children's Year. The country provides us with schools and prepares a lot of money, society provides us with health care, and careers are added one after another.

<p>Butterfly Song</p>
<p>Flutter, flutter, flutter, fluttering in the middle of flower branches. Flutter, flutter, flutter, circling under the flowers. Flutter and flutter, flutter and flutter, coming and going like light smoke, flutter and flutter, flutter and flutter, gentle breeze blowing over the wall. The fragrant flowers are warm, setting off the ten points of beauty. Try to suck the dew between the flowers, it is better than drinking nectar. Linger in front of the courtyard, don't wear it to the tail, don't provoke people to feel love and pity. Loving you and pouncing on you is even more pitiful. Space has beauty, always natural. Natural beauty, always natural, does not build a nest or borrow rafters, flutter and flutter, flutter and flutter, little butterfly is like a little fairy.</p>

<p>"The Three Smiles Reveal Their Trace"</p>
<p>Two girls sharing a bed, the feeling is doubly intimate. How strange, the village woman's words are confusing. Asking Zhou Gongzi again and again. Not worried that the wealthy family is like the deep sea. Clearly intending to coax people. The words spoken are all unfounded. The young lady is turning falsehood into truth and teasing the village girl. Ordering him to invite without delay. Wen Bin listens. Summons Ping Ting. Telling the truth is appropriate. Although he does not have Fei Changfang's shrinking earth magic. A daughter's body can also be transformed into a man's body. I am not a village girl. I am Zhou Sheng. Tonight I bet to dress as a woman. Meeting your brother who was left by heaven. Lucky it was the old man under the moon who secretly helped. My name was written on the marriage register long ago. The hidden secret is frightening. At this moment, Qian Jin wants to break her soul. Regretting just now for making a mistake in judgment. The cabinet retains funds for gifted people. Heaven's way is good and retribution is not a fallacy. Hating that my brother is too tyrannical on weekdays. Causing me to be dishonored today. Thinking of the unbearable past. It is better to die and go to Yama. Zhou Lang on the side is busy comforting. Saying that I have a wonderful plan to arrange it. Waiting for my good friend Zhishan to arrive tomorrow. Entrusting him to act as a matchmaker. A wonderful marriage will be firmly established.</p>

<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>"Jade Horse" Story</h3>
<p>"Jade Horse" is Xu Xinfu's powerful work written and directed after Beauty's Heart.</p>
<p>The name "Jade Horse" is the trademark of morphine drugs in the play. The film depicts a family in a big city. The son is the chairman of the Anti-Drug Association, but his relative Qi is the person who sells morphine drugs. As a result, the son was assassinated by his relative.</p>
<p>Later, a great detective, after countless twists and turns, finally solved the case. The whole play is bizarre and tense, and romantic insertions are added, such as the socialite Yan Yuexian, who pursues the president of the Anti-Drug Association, and the relative who sells morphine drugs, who is the most powerful person in pursuing the socialite, often preventing her from approaching his love rival. Later, when the detective shot to capture the villain, the socialite was unfortunately shot and died.</p>
<p>The film stars Yan Yuexian, Gong Jianong, Wang Weixin, Gu Lanjun, etc.</p>
<h3>Tang Jie Organizes Flood Disaster Film</h3>
<p>The National Government Yellow River Flood Relief Committee has a film of the work of blocking the Yellow River breach, and specially appointed Secretary Xu Shiku to stay in Shanghai to organize the film. Secretary Xu heard of Tang Jie's name as a quick editor and specially hired him to serve as the film editor. Now Tang Jie goes to Yipinxiang to work after leaving the New Era office every night, and it has been mostly completed. A part was screened yesterday, and the viewers were all important people, who praised Tang Jie's editing skills.</p>
<h3>A Bundle of New Era News</h3>
<p>Ye Qianyu and Tang Jie went to the Soviet Union to check the location of "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" and have returned to Shanghai. Once the preparations are ready, the whole team will go to the Soviet Union to shoot the location.</p>
<p>"Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" has a song called "Rice Planting Song," which is sung by Mr. Wang and dozens of people together. They are working hard to practice these days, and the melody is light and lively and very pleasant to listen to.</p>
<p>The Central Script Review Committee reviews scripts strictly. Most of the scripts submitted by various companies are passed with revisions, or with the note "There is nothing inappropriate, so it is temporarily passed." However, the review result of "Mr. Wang Goes to the Countryside" actually had the four characters "Quite rich in humor," which shows that the script is extraordinarily comparable.</p>
<h3>"Autumn Fan Bright Lamp" Sells Very Well</h3>
<p>The Jincheng Grand Theater on Beijing Road, in view of the fact that the air conditioning installed last summer failed to satisfy people very much, this year spared no expense to entrust York Yanghang to reinstall an ammonia air conditioner. Since its opening, the results have been excellent. The theater also uses high-quality spices and connects them to the water tank. After chemical action, they are sent to the whole theater along with the air conditioning. Therefore, it is not only cool and comfortable, but also fragrant. Currently, the theater is showing Lianhua's giant film "Autumn Fan Bright Lamp." With the film and air conditioning, both are excellent, and the sales are very strong. Below is a scene from the film.</p>
<h3>Yisheng Closes Puzzle Guessing</h3>
<p>The first issue of "Movies and Music" published by Yisheng Society sold out 10,000 copies in less than ten days. A puzzle was published in that issue. Because the Shanghai Zhonghua Daily has already revealed the answer, the puzzle guessing will be closed from the 10th of this month. The second issue is scheduled to be published around July 15th. The content is rich and more than a hundred times better than the inaugural issue.</p>
