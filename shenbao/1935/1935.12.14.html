<h3>菲島獨立之前途</h3>
<p>— 道</p>
<p>美國新聞界權威霍華特氏最扳漩菲考察。將其視察所得。發表論文一篇。其意以爲菲島於經濟上决難脫離美國而獨立。主張美菲之間應保持今日之關係。使菲島永遠處於自治之地位。受美國之保護。霍氏並謂。據其所知。菲島人士之作此主張者。實繁有徒。故美國假若能改變辦法。確定美菲間永久之連屬關係。則必能順應一般菲人之輿情。按菲島自治政府。業已成立。依照現行憲法。十年之後。卽可完全獨立。此十年內。菲島仍受美國保護。對美繼續爲有限度之自由貿易。菲島經濟生活。當不致遭受意外打擊。霍氏所述辦法。卽爲延長此半獨立狀態。或亦可使菲島免却幾分危難。顧菲人之願望是否一如霍氏所言。實屬疑問。蓋霍氏論文發表之後。菲島現任總統奎松卽宣稱。無論如何。菲人當負起建國之重任。絕不皮顧又據九日路透電云。曾受美國聖母大學榮譽博士之菲記者羅穆洛氏。亦大聲官稱。「將來如發生戰爭或任何侵略行爲。菲人必抵抗至死。且必單獨爲之。不請他人流血。」觀些二氏之言。當可明瞭菲人之心理狀態。寧爲獨立而遭受危難。不願受有損民族自尊之待遇而獲苟安也。</p>
<p>就菲島現勢以觀。經濟上除依賴美國外。似難以自存。政治上失却美國之保護。似亦難以自衛。然菲島何以陷入此種境遇乎。是則美國之統治。實應負相當的責任。按美國統治菲島。爲時已在三十五年以上。而菲島至今仍爲一農業國家。幾無工業之可言。蓋美人僅欲使其永爲美之附庸。並未爲其預備眞正獨立之條伴也。至於菲島國防上之難以自存。雖爲事實。然窺美國之意。有無保護菲島之决心。亦頗難言。如美國之顧慮美日戰爭者。常以放棄菲島爲得計。其言曰。菲島凸出過甚。一旦遭受遠東强國之攻擊。卽難自守。與其至是而拋棄。則孰若預先放棄之爲愈。更有唯圖苟安之美人。竟謂美國一日保有菲島。則一旦遭受日本攻擊之時。雖免不發生美日戰爭。故必主張從早放棄美人之抱此見解者。究有多少。姑不具論然美人未必具有衛護菲島之决心。而菲島於美人統治之下。未必獲有確切之保障。殊爲顯然。依是而言。菲島之經濟生活與政治生活。歸根結蒂。仍惟有菲人自負其責任耳。</p>
<p>按照泰定士墨兪飛之法案。菲島於今後十年內。經濟生活仍與美國發生連繫。國防方面亦受美國保護。故於此期間內。努力圖謀經濟建設。造成自給自足之國家。未始爲不可能。至於國防建設雖極艱鉅。然十年之期。爲時亦頗從容。苟能切實爲之。未必無以自存。今菲人旣不避危難。毅然負起建國責任。自當任其好自爲之。不必多所顧慮。卽或他日發生菲島無力抗禦之外患。我人以爲美人果眞愛護菲島者。大可避免統治之形式。而以友國之地位予以援助。如此始能爲國際道義樹一楷。模並爲世界和平開一生面矣。</p>

<h3>英法和平方案　阿政府拒絕接受　損害主權條件欠公允　申請國聯開大會討論　方案全文倫敦巴黎今晨同時發表</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）英法所定之和平方案、雖經阿國拒絕、今　仍將機密分送國聯行政院各委員、全文明晨將在倫敦巴黎發表、行政院將於十二月十八日開會討論該方案、阿政府拒絕該方案時宣稱照此方案、阿國土地半給予國聯、餘半併入意國，阿政府茲建議應召集國聯大會、討論此方案之條伴是否公允、現確悉該方案規定、</p>
<p>（一）阿國以達那基爾與沃迦登全部及蒂格里一部分、不連阿克森城在內、換取通海之出路、或阿薩白港或齊拉港、聽阿國選擇、阿國對此有完全主權、外傳羅馬敎廷將派特別委員國、或管理阿克森城之說、實無根據、</p>
<p>（二）阿比西尼亞全部照五人委員會之建議置於國聯之下、國聯將輔助在行政上經濟上財政上整頓一切、</p>
<p>（三）阿王所不認可之任何官員、不得設置、　南部境內所經承認之意國特別權利、以北緯六度東徑三十八度爲限、意國在此境內有移民及以註冊之公司經營一切之權利、</p>
<p>據消息靈通各界聲稱、阿國之覆文在技術上旣未接受和平方案、亦未加以拒絕、惟關於阿國主權、曾作極完全之保留、又稱如徇從阿國之請求召集國聯大會討論條件之是否公允、則將就行政院之手取此事而辦理之、因大會爲國聯最高機關也、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）國聯小國於盛怒之下、今日已强制十八國委員會允許於星期三行政院全體會議之中、詳細辯論央法兩國之和平建議、而不以該項計劃交付大國把持之五國委員會、英國國聯事務大臣艾登及法國總理兼外長賴伐爾力謀免除一切隔閡、曾稱、意阿事端之最後解决辦法、務須使國聯會員皆能接受、波蘭代表今日提議、、國聯於辯論和平方案之前、不應對於煤油禁令有何行動、至此十八國委員會即告延會、而油禁問題遂無成議、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>阿國領袖表示　割地斷難承認　雄獅决不容獰犬安然奪食　願抗戰到底克盡捍國天職　有人向阿皇進方　聽任國聯會處理</h3>
<p>阿京　英法公使今日分別將和平方案投交阿皇、阿皇美顧問柯爾遜携帶後方案於今日下午五時四十五分赴台西面呈阿皇、協商迎拒、嗣據未證實之消息、阿皇已電國聯、拒絕該案矣、（十三國民電）</p>
<p>台西城　據本社訪員所知、阿皇於接獲英法兩國解决意阿爭端之建議案後、卽派美國籍顧問柯爾遜前往京城、與英國駐阿公使巴登爵士相會晤、業於今晨接洽竣事、其會談內容、外間一無所知、柯爾遜幷已搭乘飛機前來此問、俾向國皇呈報一切、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）據本社訪員所知、關於英法兩國解决意阿爭端之建議案、有人曾向阿皇進言、勸其聽任國聯會行政院處理、以定此項建議案是否與盟約原則相抵觸、此項意見、阿皇業已採納、其對於建議案、不致再作堅决拒絕之考慮、至意國政府對於此項建議案所可提出之復文、預料亦非積極、而當附帶種種保留至英政府對於阿國通海道路問題、除就意屬阿薩勃港與英屬才拉港二者之間、聽任阿國選擇外、其由阿國京城通至海口之甬道、幷準備畀以完全主權（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）阿國駐法公使華爾特今日聲稱、一雄獅不能安然目覩獰犬竊奪彼之肉食、吾人如須單獨抵抗意軍、亦將克盡吾人之天職」云、據悉阿國之反對、係因割讓土地、將引起北方將領之不服、至於阿皇、則因鑒於意國轟炸之威力及疾病飢餓、已使阿軍軍心渙散、且檢閱北路軍隊之後、深覺失望、迄今猶未敢遽下反攻瑪加爾之令、故和平計劃亦可接受、今日據悉、阿皇不久或將返至京城、以便與彼之美籍顧問柯爾遜計議一切、而陸軍部長蓋太·北路司令賽雄及喀薩等、亦均勸彼勿親往前綫云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>意覆文尙有待　事前須報告最高黨會議</h3>
<p>阿京　英國駐阿公使巴登及法國駐阿公使鮑達、將於明日以英法和平計劃、遞交阿國政府、計劃內容、將以無綫電拍住台西轉達阿皇、阿國領袖今日表示、阿皇對於任何對意割讓土地之建議、定將拒絕云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）據本社訪員所知、意相墨索里尼對於英法兩國建議案之覆文、未必在行政院開會之前送達國聯會、緣意國政府須於事前報告該國法西斯黨最高會議、此項會議定於本月十八日舉行、適與行政院預定開會日期相同也、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）外交部發言人頃向外國記者發表談話、對於意阿兩國講和問題、囑其不可過分樂觀、據云、「英法兩國向首相所提出之伴、未可認爲一種提案、實乃未來談判之出發點、意國政府當以同情心理穩健精神加以研究、此際若遽以樂觀爲事、則工作進行、將因而威受不便」云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>國聯行政院　定下週三召集　考慮意阿媾和方案　艾登賴伐爾昨返國</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）英法和平方案今日午後由十八人委員會舉行非公開會議考慮之、英代表艾登主張公開會議、未經衆贊成、波蘭代表建議一切國際事伴應由國聯行政院辦理、無庸移交五人委員會、經衆贊同、今日艾登在會發簡短之演說、謂英法所商定之和平方案、旣非確定的、亦非一成不昂的、如有改善之建議、無任歡迎、茲宜儘速召集國聯行政院會議、聆取各方對和平方案之意見然後決定其所願進行之方針、以應付因此引起之局勢、如國聯不贊同英法之建議、吾人並不抱怨云、法總理賴伐爾贊同艾登之主張、委員會乃延會至明日、明日將討論實施對意制裁情形之報告書、今日艾登在十八人委員會前所發之演說、已引起此問許多評論、國聯行政院已定十二月十八日開會討論英法之和平方案、據各方意見、極少通過之機會專家委員會所撰之制裁報告書、今晚已分送國聯各國代表、其中表明今已有五十國政府實施對意之經濟與財政制裁、成績殊佳云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（日內瓦）英國不管部大臣艾登法國總理兼外長賴伐爾均於本十八國小組委員會開會之後、遄返本國、一俟意阿兩國政府對於英法建議案之復文到達日內瓦、卽當於下星斯三日卽十八日電行前來、以便參加行政院會議、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）據事業報駐日內瓦訪員消息、賴伐爾總理與英國霍爾外相所擬解决意阿爭端之方案、已於星期二日在巴黎修改一次、（按英國外務次官汪西泰、曾於是日與賴伐爾總理會晤、將方案加以修正）、關係甚爲重要、其內容係（一）由意國以伊利特里南海濱之阿薩勃港、連同甬道一條讓予阿比西尼亞、此一甬道當自海口起、而與阿京相啣接、（二）蒂格里省並非全部割讓、阿國僅以北部領土連同阿狄格拉城阿杜華城與泰加士河割讓意國、（三）阿國以沃迦登省割讓意國、（四）阿國其餘土地、連同准許意國殖民之地帶在內、應樹立國際委任統治制、而由國聯會行政院五國委員會担任監督之責、意國在殖民地帶內並無募集警察之權利、此項方案大抵將於本日在日內瓦公布、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>英法兩國內部　反對之聲蠭起　英工黨將彈劾政府　赫禮歐擬以去就爭</h3>
<p>（倫敦）工黨將於日內在下院提出彈劾政府案、，蓋不滿意於外相霍爾與法總理賴伐爾所商定解决意阿戰爭之和平方案也、自由黨已提出動議、譴責侵犯阿比西尼亞土地完整與獨立之任何解决、贊助政府之議員六人亦將提出同樣動議、據巴黎消息、法國之主張對意制裁者現亦集合反對和平方案、急進社會黨與社會黨均將利用此機質問政府、薩繆爾自由黨領袖薩繆爾今日在倫敦某處演說和平方案、謂霍爾此舉、實其外相任內第一大錯、此項建議不特承認侵略之所獲、且以意軍迄今未能奪有之士地拱手奉之、國聯與阿比西尼亞斷不能接受云、（十二日路透電）</p>

<p>（巴黎）法政府不管部閣員赫禮歐反對英法調解意阿爭議方案、今日有以去就力爭之勢、赫氏如實踐其言、則政府勢將解體、蓋以赫氏爲激進社會黨領袖、而激進社會黨又爲衆院政府黨之中堅也、（十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）激進黨領袖前任航空部長柯德今日已在衆院左翼議員中開始運動、要求立刻辯論外交問題、柯氏謂現在法國對於意阿爭端之政策、竟有犧牲集體保安之性質、且有使國聯酬謝侵略者之意、如此將削弱法國在世界各國間之道德力量云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<h3>美議同鳴不平　英法方案獎勵暴行　與國聯會目的相悖</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）美參議員樊登堡今日發言抨擊國聯與英法和平方案、謂吾人現愈信通至和平之路、無庸經過國聯或會員國之合作、因國聯乃政洽機關、而非和平機關也、所謂和平方案者、適合於强國之需要、而不適合於國聯目的云、（十三路透電）</p>
<h3>東菲意空軍　轟炸不設防區　意政府致文國聯否認</h3>
<p>（日內瓦）意政府今日致文國聯、正式否認意飛機曾轟擊阿國任何不設防之城鎭、謂意飛機近今猛轟之台西城、乃敵人最大軍事中心點之一、意飛機飛於距地四千呎以下者、多被高射砲擊中、此足證明該城設防之鞏固、文內又稱、台西被轟之次日、意飛機見該城四處滿懸紅十字旗號、雖軍營與飛行塲亦有之云、（十三日路透社電）</p>
<h3>國際茶產會議　明年四月在倫敦開會　英將施限制計劃　於華茶前途不利</h3>
<p>華聯社香港訊　據倫敦電訊、國際茶業委員會、將在倫敦開會、關於每年出口比量、則定明年四月起實行、因數年來英茶减少、致茶價上漲、預料英方比量將增加百分之二五、而爲百分之八十五、華茶因華幣銳跌、故英國將再行限制計劃、此事顯於中國茶葉業有所不利云、</p>
<h3>外蒙代表遊俄　日本異常注意</h3>
<p>（東京）日本外務省接得駐蘇太田大使公電、謂本月十一日有蒙古代表蒙古人民共和國國務院主席肯頓、陸軍部長德米特·外交部司長那薩萊等三人抵莫斯科、擬與蘇聯開始政治折衝、在「滿」蒙會議破裂後、忽有蒙代表直接與蘇聯談判、日本極爲注意云、（十三日華聯電）</p>
<h3>海軍要救平等　日本成為衆矢之的　各國聯合陣綫美反對尤力　海軍會議休會至週一再關</h3>
<p>（倫敦）據本社訪員所知、海軍會議各國代表對於日本「共同最高額」之主張、莫不表示異議、其所根據之理由雖有不同、其反對心理則一、關於此層、日本與各國之見解、從此已無調和餘地、日本代表團昨日對於他國代表團所提各項問題、商略答復之後、各該國對於日本意志所在、雖未完全明瞭、但已結成「聯合陣綫」以與日本對抗、則屬旣定事實、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）海軍會議第一委員會今晨賡續開會後、日本代表與美國暨其他各國代表、雙方主張仍未有妥協餘地、日本代表曾在本日會議中、提出兩項要求、（一）廢止各項具有攻擊性之軍艦、（二）防禦性之軍艦、應採用共同最高額、以期達到不相威脅目的、美國代表當卽加以反駁、謂現行海軍均勢、足以防止一切威脅行爲、日本對於該國國防所需之軍艦旣主張加以維持、其對於他國所需各種軍艦、則要求予以廢止、實無以自完其說、法國代表對於英美日三大海軍國樹立共同最高額、卽維持原來比率制一層表示異議、此在日本代表則謂最高額辦法、若由歐洲各國共同參加、日本幷不出而反對、至此、乃由南菲洲聯邦代表發言、對於英國代表昨日所發表之言論、表示贊成、幷謂此舉乃以自主國資格出之、而非以大不列顚帝國自洽頒資格出之、日本代表對於此言、立卽提出抗議、謂各自治領若均以自主國資格、則海軍會議實難賡續進行、會議卽此宣告延會、迄未達到各項結果、各國首席代表定於下星期一日午後分別會晤、俾使會議工作能有進歩、緣開會以來爲時已一星其尚無進歩可言也、（十三日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）海軍會議今日討論日本之平等要求歷二小時、决定休會至下星期一繼續討論、（十三日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）美報所載昨日海軍會議中法代表與他國代表一致反對日本之要求云云、茲聞此說不確、日代表之態度以爲凡涉及三大太平洋國之問題須先解决、而後再及歐洲問題、法代表團曾向聲明法國對於華府會議所行之前例、不願再見於此次會議中、法代表之意、華府會議所主首先處理涉及三大海軍國諸問題之手續、甚不良好、故彼等甯願復用倫敦會議中之手續、而不願遭遇三大海軍國所已商得之妥協、關於質的限制問題、法代表願每艦開造之前將詳細情形通告共他各國、蓋如此庶可銷除突然驚人之因素、法國視此爲軍備競爭主要因紫之一、外傳法海長畢特里氏現來倫敦一節、此間法人各界並無所知、（十三日路透電）</p>
<h3>第一委員會　前開會情形　美代表提三項理由　駁覆日本均等要求</h3>
<p>（倫敦）海軍會議第一委員會本日會議情形、有如下述、</p>
<p>英國代表對於日本要求平等權利、提出一項問題、卽此項要求究係純粹原則問題、抑係日本確欲擴充海軍至與英美兩國海軍平等任何辦法凡可使日本海軍與大不列顚帝國或美國在實際上享有平等權利者、絕非英國所能接受、美國代表繼之發言、（詳見另電）對於日本所提主張、亦表示反對、法國代表則謂該國對於日本海軍平等要求、並無直切關係、但「共同最高額」若果見諸實施、則各國均可建造軍艦以與英美兩國並駕齊驅、自未便加以贊助、又况此項最高額得授德國以口實而任其要求修改英德海軍協定、（英德海軍協定係於本年六月十八日簽訂、、規定德國海軍噸位應爲英國百分之三十五）法國代表嗣又指陳「共同最高額」與原來之比率制、未見有何區別、甚或省於比率制、要之、海軍會議欲其不致失敗、唯一方法厥惟討論質的限制問題而已、加拿大澳洲與南菲洲各代表繼起發言、對於美國所提出之異議、均表示贊助、並說明大不列顛帝國各項需要、請與會各國加以注意、又謂「數字平等」一項主張、質無價值可言、至是日本代表永野大將起立發言、仍以爲「共同最高額」係屬必要、並謂日本準備將此項共同額、减至該國現有噸位之下、至共同額實現之後、地理軍略上若干種特別情形亦不妨顧及之、但應如何顧及、則未完全說明、意國代表以爲各國在地理上情形互異、「共同最高額」在事實上無可實施、最後日本代表結束討論、謂各國代表所述各點、會須縝密加以考慮、並於明日午前委員會開會時、提出答案云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據本社訪員所知、海軍會議第一委員會今晨開會時、美國代表曾提出重大國營企業議三項、用以駁覆日本「共同最高額」之主張、計（一）英美兩國海軍噸位若須減至日本海軍水準、以便實現平等權利、英國既已堅決反對、則所謂共同最高額苟欲付諸實施、自須提高日本海軍水準、此與美國所主張限制海軍縮減海軍之原則背道而馳、（二）擬議中之「共同最高類」、可使華府海約所規定之均勢完全推翻、此項均勢、實乃美國所認爲維持遠東與太平洋安定局勢之主要因素、（三）日本所提主張、並未顧及各國在地理軍略土之特別情形暨所負責任、至美國所謂「責任」、與日本所謂「易受攻擊」、未可混爲一談云、（十二日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>美海軍要員　白宮秘密會議</h3>

<h3>美財長　宣布購銀現狀　不專向倫敦購買</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）財長毛根韜今日批評銀市風潮、稱賡續執行美國購銀法、該法規定如認爲合理而有裨公衆利益、則不論價格如何條件如何、隨時可向國內外購銀、但吾人現向世界各地購銀、而不再側重於倫敦、本星期中吾人曾逐日向外國購買數起云、惟毛氏不願說明購買之地點、專家推測購買之地必有數處、大概爲芒特利·印度·墨西哥·或中國、毛氏繼稱、彼不能討論美國財部未能維持倫敦市塲之原因、自一九三三年十二月至今、財部共購白銀七六一·七七四、〇〇〇盎斯、自一九三四年六月十九日至今、則購進五九一、八〇〇、〇〇〇盎斯、財部所購新出鑛白銀、共計五六、九四三、〇〇〇盎斯、頒佈白銀國有今後又將得一一三、〇三一、〇〇〇盎斯（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美財長摩甘索今日否認美國中止購銀說、謂本週中美國逐日在許多不同地點購進白銀、但不復如從前專在倫敦購銀耳、至於本週究在何處購銀、則美財長不願說明之、亦不承認或否認直接對華交易之說、美財長謂購銀法案有財長得根據其所認爲適當而最益於公共利益條件購買白銀規定、此條文不可不特別注意云、摩氏言外之意、似謂目前銀市情形、實以價格問題爲其因素、或詢以目前是否考慮將銀價抑低、摩氏對此問話不置一詞、僅謂渠對白銀派議員而發履行購銀法之諾言、今仍有效云、摩氏承認不復專在倫敦購銀一舉、將使財部購銀地點移至紐約之說、愈爲有力、摩氏估計財部昨在紐約購進白銀、較在倫敦所購者約多一倍、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）今日美國仍購白銀、雖使銀市人心稍安、然倫敦銀市所抱現銀價格可照常按時揭示之希望、迄未實現、現銀掛牌卒爲二十六便士八七五、比昨跌六二五、聞出賣數較昨略减、而美國收買則較昨爲多、故賣戶方面攤賣之數爲百分之十八、昨日則僅及百分之七·五、美財部今日變更從前習慣、欲使經紀人各個報告其所接之委託出賣數、美財長摩甘索所發美國並未中止購銀之言論、已使銀市有生氣、而造成良好印象、衆意美國在原則上顯然準備繼續購銀、國際銀市狀况可期穩健、說者謂美國大約將變更其購銀政策、依據匯兌平準金所採用之方法、而不在一個市塲收買、以免爲衆共知此舉可認爲智慧、再在遠期到期之數、行將减少、亦可使銀市和緩云、（十二日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）倫敦銀市現漸髯靜、現貨貞者仍多、不過視前數日爲少耳、美國改變政策後、倫敦今日缺少可能的大批收買之氣象、出賣委託大都限價、銀市間之更劇烈的競爭、終必發作、早在一般人意料中、倫敦並不以此爲異、蓋知倫敦近來獨握銀市牛耳之地位、雖其利頗薄、然不能垂諸久遠也、（十三日路透電）</p>
<p>（紐約）此間金融專家今日聲稱、美國財部如抑低購價、定能以每盎斯值四角或三角之代價、收買白銀、美國國際貿易協會會長湯默斯表示、該會最近曾要求撤消購銀法、放棄政府之貨幣試騐、並引證福勃斯所率領之美國遠東經濟考察團之報告、稱購銀法未能實現吾人之希望、而反引起中國之痛苦、並搖動美國與遠東之貿易關係云、（十二日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）財長毛根韜所稱美國已將購銀電心自倫敦移至世界市塲、益增此間財政專家之所信、彼等咸認此次措施、且有國　動機、但對於此舉目的是否避免購買私販出口之中國白銀、抑係擊破倫敦市塲投機家之勢力、則意見紛歧、據財長公布購銀統計、可知自國外購入之白銀較一般人想象者為多、參院膨脹派領袖湯邁斯因此發言、稱財長如能時時公布購銀之經過、則不致發生此次風潮云、湯氏並表示贊成財部向世界市塲購銀、但對於倫敦紐約銀價之續跌、不無失望云、十二日國民電）</p>

<p>開羅　一九二三年之埃及憲法昨經內閣决定恢復、並由國王核准後、共第二步關於重行確定英埃關係之行動、將由英國爲之、而英政府、不久卽可說明其政策消息靈通之觀察者聲稱、英國或能承認恢復憲決國民黨興自由黨組織混合政府後之局勢但大概將竭力展緩條約談判云、（十二日國民社電）</p>

<p>金銀</p>
<p>倫敦金價　今日縮去一便士、而爲一百四十一先令一便士、</p>
<p>倫敦銀市　今日氣象、已不若前數日之悲觀、商人似漸甯靜、以適應此新狀况出賣之數、現較减少、限價出賣者漸多、</p>
<p>芒特里銀　今日開盤時售者又索價較高、因美財長摩甘索昨日聲稱、美政府將繼續購銀、至於倫敦銀市之低落、泰半係美國不復專在倫敦購銀所致也、開盤時購者出價、對於近期未有變更、但對遠期則逐漸高起、</p>
<p>滙兌</p>
<p>英美　倫敦外匯市塲、今晨交易甚微、英美匯價開盤爲四元九角二分六八七五、較昨日美英收盤低〇六二五、第一小時內漲一二五、而爲四元九角二分八一二五、後無變動、</p>
<p>英法　開盤漲三磅音、第一小時漲八磅音、、午時無變動、一時跌三磅音、二時復回起三磅音而爲七四佛郎五四、</p>
<p>美法　今日紐約外匯市塲、金幣匯價開盤稍疲、法佛郎跌六二五、而爲六元六角一分二五、</p>
<p>棉麥</p>
<p>紐約棉市　今因國外電訊良好、並表同情於麥市、故開盤頗健、漲起十磅音左右、價格繼續上漲、其原因有三、（一）銀市稍有轉機、（二）棉市多頭了結已多、（三）預料當局已準備統制棉產之其他方法、以防彭海德法案被法院判爲違法也、</p>

<h3>北河南路血案上訴　駱虞生希望减刑捕房則請按律另科　金戴氏興駱父生前之關係尙須調查</h3>
<p>南市新橋路三十一號明晨小學校總務主任浙江義烏人駱虞生、因於本年九月二十三號晨八時一刻、糾同在逃之二人、持利斧兩柄、闖至北河南路四五九號、將金華婦人金戴氏（即寶貞）及女傭羅郭氏二人殺死、幷盜取財物、業經匯司捕房華探長尚武·探目趙淸奎·將駱虞生拘解第一特院、迭次訊供明晰、判决駱共同殺人、處無期徒刑、竊盜一罪、處徒刑一年、執行</p>
<p>無期徒刑</p>
<p>褫褫奪公權終身、附帶民訴移送吳庭審判各情、已誌本報、茲悉此案捕房方面及被告駱虞生奉判、均表示不服、分別向高二分院提起上訴、昨日午後、山刑庭長郁華·偕蔣·周·兩推事升座刑一庭提訊、而首席檢察官鄭鉞、亦蒞庭執行職務、郁庭長首向駱虞生訊問上訴理由、據駱稱、因我父駱肇新、於去年在淸和坊被殺、確爲金戴氏所害死、而我</p>
<p>為父復仇</p>
<p>對於法律人情均有可恕之處、故請求减輕刑期、繼由工部局代理張天蔭律師起而述明上訴意旨、謂驗虞生之父駱肇新、向在甯波執行律師職務、而金戴氏之夫金兆鑾則任甯波地方法院檢察官、誼屬師生、繼成知友、自金兆鑾死後、即將家務托駱照拂、往來頗密、毫無恩怨可言、去年六月十九、駱在淸和坊被殺、對於金戴氏</p>
<p>絕無關係</p>
<p>嗣捕房曾接到匿名信、報告謂駱係被張某所害、捕房即往拘捕、而張已聞風逃避、一面由金戴氏將鑽戒一只、委托何璂律師變賣、得洋一百元、代駱懸賞緝拿兇手、是金戴氏對於駱家、可謂恩至義盡、此次被告駱虞生恩將仇報、竟糾黨持斧前往、將氏殺死、且將氏頸項間所帶之項練手上金戒均搶去實爲强盜殺人人疑、初審認定駱係犯竊盜罪</p>
<p>及殺人罪</p>
<p>分別判刑、似見失當、應請廢除原判、按照刑法三百三十二條强盜殺人罪處以相當之刑云云、詰之駱虞生復稱、我父駱肇新、向在甯波執行律務、已達十餘年、自被金戴氏奸誘之後、即離甬來滬同居、初租屋於閘北寶山路、因適逢一二八戰事、致器具蕩然無存、後遷至北河南路四五九號、繼續同居、幷向甯波老家將傢具搬滬、且將我母親</p>
<p>迫回鄉間</p>
<p>去秋、我父在淸和坊事務所附近被殺、而父親所有之財產、如玉米餅波賣去房產洋八千元、及永豫紗廠股欵、杭州地方銀行存欵等等、均被金氏所覇佔、箱中物件、亦已空無所有、其時我正與母親向金氏交涉交還財產之際、突接恐嚇信一封、內中言詞恫嚇、迫我從速離滬、否則須將我殺死、幷指殺死我父者爲住於勞神父路之張某、我當將信送交老閘捕房前往調查、則該處係</p>
<p>日人寓所</p>
<p>且查該信上之字跡、似係出於金戴氏手筆、是我父此次被殺、半因金氏圖吞奪父親之財產、半係另有原因、庭上詰以是何原因、駱稱、因無證據、不便言明、且與金家名譽有關等語、捕房律師即將金戴氏之遺墨呈案、謂核與信上之字、絕端不同、而駱否認捕房律師所呈出之字條爲金氏之手筆、謂金氏前服務於商務印書館、可以調查其筆跡、郁庭長核供、以本案尚有改期調查之必要、乃諭駱虞生還押、候定期再訊、</p>

<p>前三北輪船公司買辦范秉華之妾邱氏家住於龍門路信平里六號門牌、平日因將其婢女周美英及順弟二人虐待、致各受重傷、而順弟且因傷致命、范邱氏亦逃避無踪、業經成都路捕房華探長馮百順·探目王善卿·等、將順弟之己體、昇入騐屍所、由特一院檢察處檢騐、各情已誌本報、茲悉該婢女周美英（十二歲）、順弟（十歲）均於去歲被賣入范邱氏家爲婢、但氏生性暴戾、手段慘酷、平日藉其主婦之地位、</p>
<p>濫施權威</p>
<p>稍不如意、即施種種毒辣酷刑、該氏有女傭蘇州人朱氏、又名朱徐氏、老妹妹、年已六十歲、在范邱氏家服務、已達十三年、深得主婦之寵、遂爲虎作倀、助暴爲虐、而范邱氏亦受權與朱氏、形同婢僕之總管、其手段之兇險、較主婦尤甚、致主僕閒對於兩婢管束極嚴、非但食不充飢、衣不暖體、且如遇言語不聽作事不佳、即施毒刑、除以</p>
<p>柴年　鞋底</p>
<p>痛打外、並以香烟火燙之、致兩婢遍體鱗傷、骨瘦如柴、某次、朱氏並以剪刀將周美英之右手小指一節剪去、即順弟於近來惠病頗重時、朱氏尚以其頭向房門猛撞、直至病入膏育、始將順弟關入空室、任其自斃、捕房於出事後、對於范邱氏·朱氏·二人、竭力偵查、曾至西藏路東方飯店五百十七號房間拘捕、但氏等已</p>
<p>聞風逃逸</p>
<p>後在鄭家木橋一百三十號門牌將朱氏逮捕、帶入捕房、於昨晨解送第一特院刑八庭、依照刑法二七八條一二欵二八六條第一欵傷害及傷害致死罪起訴、即據捕房律師張天蔭陳述以上情形稱、本月十一號下午四時四十二分、捕房接電話報告、謂龍門路信平里六號、有人虐待婢女、乃飭探前往調查、初因室中人一致否認、且未得證據、正欲退回之際、因</p>
<p>又得密報</p>
<p>故復行詳查、常在亭子間中發現婢女順弟氣息奄奄、病勢極重、乃將車送廣仁醫院、中途身死、被告朱氏即於此際偕范邱氏潛逃、遂對另一婢周美英帶入捕房、據周稱、主婦及被告將其待遇極劣、平日不許食飽、且時加毆打及火燙、現經廣仁醫院騐明頭部有傷、臂上滿現燙傷之疤痕、死者順弟、</p>
<p>骨瘦如柴</p>
<p>照其情形、似係平時無充分之食量、始有此現象、總之本案被告與其主婦范邱氏、同施酷刑、作此慘無人道之事、實無罕見云云、詰之被告朱氏供、順弟於去年十一月、由其主婦以九十六元買作婢女、美英亦係去年買來、主婦對兩婢時常毒打及香烟火燙、均有其事、我亦係受命管束兩婢、平日食量、確有限制、因多食啊</p>
<p>愚笨之虞</p>
<p>美英之右手小指、並非我剪去、實因其生癤作濃爛去、本年五月間、順弟忽生肺病、由我領往仁濟堂診治一次、後因病重、無藥可醫、故奉主婦之命、將其送入空房、前日未死之前、我確曾將其頭向房門猛撞一下等詞、又據范邱氏家之包車夫崔鴻生·奶媽方陳氏·等證明兩婢受害情形、又據婢女周美英證明受被告剪去小指及毆打狀况、吳則韓推事核供、諭朱氏押候改期十八號再訊、美英暫送濟良所、</p>

<h3>小男兒　（一二三）</h3>
<p>— Louisa　M.　Alcott原著　鄭曉滄譯</p>
<p>等到他們已到了大草原時，別的燈籠，也是來來去去像鬼火一般，遍野聽到裴先生的聲音在呌着，「南恩，羅勃羅勃，南恩！」賴司務噓吹，狂嘯：唐恩坐着兎披東奔來，西奔去，兎披也似乎解事，所以踰越險阻，無有難色。蜀夫人常常要他們大家肅靜一下，喉裏帶着粳咽說道，『太響的聲音也許會嚇慌了他們，讓我來呌罷；羅勃知道我的聲音的；』於是她以各種輕柔的情調呼那個親愛的小名字，直到回音裏也在輕柔地噓應着，和風又像很願將它吹送到各方：然而始終沒有答語來。</p>
<p>這時天上已滿罩鳥雲，月亮也只只偶然一探首，熱電常從雲裏發射出來，遠處隱的雷聲彷彿預吿大風雨的將至了。</p>
<p>『啊我的羅勃！我的羅勃！』可憐的蜀夫人可憐地呌着，來來去去像似一個形容慘淡的鬼物，而唐恩則依在她的旁邊，有似一個忠誠耿耿的游火蟲。『假如南恩有個三長二短，我有什麼話可以對她的父親說呢？我不知道爲什麽我會將我的寳貝托付給一個人走這麽遠的路！茀力子，你有聽到什麽嗎』？等到她得到一個可憐的答語『沒有』，她絞她的兩隻手，愈益表出絕望的情緒，唐恩看見此情，便從兎披背上跳了下來，連韁繫在柵欄上，且以其果毅的精神說道。。</p>
<p>『也許他們到了泉水邊去了！我去看』。</p>

<p>昨晚西青籃球僅甲組賽二塲、其中以暨南對協興之戰、精彩百出、引人入勝、協興自戰勝麥令後、軍容大振、屢戰屢勝、即昨與暨南之比賽、亦一路領前上半時曾以十九比八佔先、下半時暨南努力奮鬥、緊緊追隨、至最後、五秒鐘時、協興就以二十七比二十六獲勝、不意王南珍百步穿揚、暨南遂憑此一球、而反以一分之　佔先、勝負得失之間、誠有幸有不幸也、另一塲爲約翰對優游、結東五十二比三十五、優游敗北、</p>

<p>（二）暨南勝協興</p>
<p>比賽開始後、相持約三份鐘之久、各無紀錄、旋王南珍單槍匹馬、籃下托進一球、協興陳宗祺亦不甘示弱、左右開弓猛增四分、自後恊興聲勢極盛、前鋒後衛、連貫一氣、刹那間、張錦祥又罰得二分、以六比二佔先、暨南再接再厲、韓振元王南珍憑添三分、又成極接近之局面、於是雙方益戰益烈、但見十員健將、滿塲飛馳、一時空氣之緊張、可謂無以復加、協興則三軍用命、前鋒徐亨周達雲丘廣爕尤爲勇狠、暨南極力招架、致還擊無機、在此情况下、協興乃乘勢而入、果然靑雲直上、以十九比八結束上半時、誠黄金時代也、</p>
<p>再戰聲中、暨南更爲小心翼翼、韓振元先示下馬威、連中一一球、張錦祥亦不辱使命、再爲協興建蹟二分、陳宗祺罰得一分、形勢依然佳妙、然天有不測風雲、暨南忽一聲總攻、韓振元蔡演雄尹貴仁有如出籠之虎、活躍非常、頓追成二十比二十二、僅以一球屈居下風耳、至斯恊興亦不甘怠慢、於是戰局復趨白熱化、旋暨南憑苦幹之精神、卒打成二十六比二十六之平局、旋王南珍犯規、張錦祥一罰中的、協興又以一分之差再度超出、是時詛終了時間僅一分鐘羣料協興當可取勝、不意至最後二秒鐘時王南珍帶球深入、忽然福至心靈、遙遙一射、竟然應聲而中、未及中圈跳球、而銀笛聲亦隨之長鳴、協興遂以一分之差、先勝後敗、誠不幸之至也、</p>

<h3>鐵城盃籃球　崇德力克啓秀</h3>
<p>另旦星粤東力隊獲勝　今晚東亞對江灣劇戰</p>
<p>鐵城盃籃球賽、昨日乙組四塲、計乙三旦星勝健民、乙二粤東勝二七、乙一力隊勝江灣、女乙崇德勝啟秀、以力隊江灣之戰、及崇德啟秀之賽、競爭劇烈、表演精彩、今晚甲組賽、東亞逢江灣、東亞擁有許瑞瑔等勇將多人、全隊合作佳妙、傳遞迅速、實力殊稱强勁、而江灣隊即復旦化身、在西青籃球賽中克服麥令期、其實力之强、不言可知、今晚兩雄相遇、必有一番劇戰、另女乙華東對愛國、亦有可觀、茲將昨賽結果及今日秩序錄下、</p>
<p>旦星勝健民　（乙三）　四十二比十七</p>
<p>粤東勝二七　（乙二）　三十九比十三</p>
<p>力隊勝江灣乙　（乙一）　二十五比廿二</p>
<p>崇德勝啟秀　（女乙）　十五比十</p>
<p>崇德啟秀、原係姊妹學校隊、惟崇德資格較老、啟秀組織不及一年、故較差一著、崇德李韞芝短小精桿、活躍全塲、得分獨多、而啟秀溫嬡其球藝亦自可觀、惟全隊合作方面、不及崇德、且多盧擲致遭失敗、上半時崇德以八比四佔先、雙方防守均嚴得分不易、下半時啟秀力圖反攻、以七對六之比較、僅輸一分、其競爭劇烈可知、結果崇德以十五比十克服啟秀、</p>

<h3>紗花　紗花至後市重見漲</h3>
<p>紗市始跌繼漲、但局勢平靜、良以空方多數為同業、在近月交貨甚湧、壓迫頗重、故本月午後開盤、低峰曾見一百九十三元、與遠期價相差小十元外、足見空頭利用現品供給之壓力殊强也、然查大阪三品紗之陣容、係近高而遠低、吾國標紗與其適成相反、目前倉庫存紗、巳達九千包以外、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （鐵吾）</p>
<p>前夕在友人處，聞某商人因在浴室內觸犯某營營長，致享鐵窗生活。蓋彼入浴時，浴池內人極擁擠，適該營長橫臥其內，一絲不掛，固難識其為何流人物，遂強其讓坐。及出，見該營長身着戎服，心知有誤，趨前求恕，弗果，遂被陷。於此可知一般人眼中，「只見衣冠小見人」。</p>
<p>我村甲乙二人，素仇對，誓不共生，後甲入伍為軍官，乙遇之，膜拜不已。某問曰：「君何為而拜仇人乎？」乙答日：「非拜彼也，拜彼衣冠也」。兩事遙遙相對，可笑亦復可歎。</p>
<h3>長壽秘訣</h3>
<p>— 茱英</p>
<p>這次，承一位朋友的介紹，謁見他的一位九十七歲的外祖父。這位老人，今年雖已九十七歲了，但是雙目還是炯炯有光，全口的牙齒，也還只掉了二個臼齒，三個門齒。他雖然也扶了一根杖，但看他步履還很輕便。不過二個耳却是聾的。據說是十七歲上害病而聾掉的。因此我和他會免時，我發問，都是用筆寫的。</p>
<p>據他說，他的所以能長壽，是淸心寡慾。他生平沒曾二色過。在四十三歲上，他的夫人故世後，便度着鰥居生活。他不信宗教，但是在飲食方面，極為精細。不抽烟，不喝酒，普通不吃葷，每天只是以菜蔬豆腐等佐膳。在五十歲上，戒除了茶癖，只以開水解渴。現在雖然老了，但每天至少得散步半小時。晚上最遲八點鐘睡覺，早上五點鐘起牀。現在雖然小輩勸他遲起些，生怕早起了受寒，但早起已有六十年的習慣，所以遲起了倒反而不得勁。</p>
<p>他說，他的所以能長壽，一方面果然是自己保重，一方面還得歸功於雙耳的失聰。雙耳失了聰，果然有時也覺得煩悶，但失聰之後一二年，習慣已成了自然，倒反而覺得不聞是幸福，樂得少費些心兒。一個人，最容易衰老的原因，就是愛管閒事，耳聾了，聽不見，甚麽都不管，不容易傷心，也不容易動怒，這自然是長壽原因之一。</p>
<p>這位老人所說的長壽法，或許有人說是很平凡的，但我覺得就是這麽平凡，也已是不易學的了。</p>
<h3>中國人最先發見好望角的新說</h3>
<p>— 特</p>
<p>南非著名著作家格林氏，曾在非洲大陸探險多年，發見它的奇怪秘密，最近著了一卷新書，名叫「非洲的大神秘」。書中說：今人都知道非洲的好望角，是葡萄牙大探險家狄亞士發見的，其實在狄氏發見以前幾百年，中國人已早發見了。一隻中國沙船，在古時沿着非洲海濱，向南進行，不能說是幻想。大約他們非出本意，旅行於柯林特斯角南面，那角在他們所知道的世界邊際，那摩桑比克海峽的潮流很急，沙船在東北時季風前，被風力所摧，不能折回平日熟悉的東海濱的口岸。英國海軍部所發的非洲南海濱和東海濱的航行指導，可以表明這樣的一隻沙船，當日的遭遇。那船被風驅向南行，直到阿迦爾哈斯的溫流把它擋住，那溫流的一部分，繞過阿迦爾哈斯岸的南部，然後再向西北，經過好望角。那沙船於是順着那北流而進，達到好望角，或被無情的向岸急流捲擱在那瑪瓜倫Namaqualand附近的岩石上，或更有幸，擱在沙灘上。有一事是無疑的，定有幾隻船曾平安傳泊。格林氏提出一種證據，證明他這個新說，那證據便是那瑪瓜倫有一種民族，直到今日，還具有和中國人相同的許多特性，他那書中還印有許多可貴的照片。</p>
<h3>海寧會議之姿勢</h3>
<p>—</p>
<h3>皮帶恨</h3>
<p>— 拾玖</p>
<p>好景不常，彩雲易散。這眞是古今同慨的。</p>
<p>某女士在×校讀書時，綺年玉貌，素有校花之譽。伊那回眸一笑，暈透雙渦時的情態，眞不知顛倒了幾多異姓同學。可是伊貌雖艷若桃李，心却冷似冰霜，原來伊早已有了心上人了。伊的心上人是一位背皮帶的標準國民。少年英俊，好不氣概！伊倆的友愛關係，是非常密切的。會客室裏，常有伊倆的足跡，旁觀者固不以為奇了。還有，綠衣人為了伊倆，疲於奔命；電話局裏的接綫員，為了伊倆，亦忙個不停。總之，除了星期日，伊倆幾無日不在直接或間接中喁喁情話的。</p>
<p>這樣說來，那末美人勇士，克成眷屬，豈不是相得益彰嗎？不，好景不常，彩雲易散：曾幾何時，伊倆突婚媾而變為寇仇，甚至伊竟喪生在皮帶之下，含寃千古了！事變是從伊男友寄了伊一封信而起。男女通信，事本平常；可是這信竟激起了那位「標準國民」之怒，與伊以不能容忍的難堪。某女士含寃莫伸，初椎胸大哭；不足，又取了那根武裝皮帶，猛擊不已。一下，十下，至於無數下；結果：伊嘔血了，暈倒了，不到數天，遂香消玉殞了。那位「標準國民」獰笑道：「算我晦氣，又損失了三百元！」</p>
<p>得到了噩耗，伊的友人都同聲地喟歎着說：「皮帶可畏！」</p>
<h3>陸家浜的燕子窩</h3>
<p>— 子明</p>
<p>京滬綫陸家浜第三期換領烟照的我始，已過了好幾天烟民仍存觀望，不願將吸烟的資金來繳納照費。但開們奉到上司的命令，限定日期要辦完竣；只得帶了兩位警士到燕子窩去檢查。</p>
<p>在一條街弄裏，經過幾個曲折，就到了屋快坍下，閉着門窗，烟味從壁縫中秀透出來的售吸所。推開了門，就是更濃重的沒把握襲來，使頭腦頓時暈悶了。有三五個動物在黑暗中對着燐火也似的微燈蠕動着。我們三個人跑進去，他們毫不介意地繼續扶着長槍吸着，吐着烟霧，弄着烟泡，喝着茶，看上去，他們似在天堂裏過着安樂的生活。——只有他們自信着。</p>
<p>一個警士守住着門，另一個帶着北方口音的警士嚷着：「你們將烟照拿出來」橫在榻上幾位烟民好像靑天霹靂，都顫抖抖地拿出烟照，正在拿着戤子稱烟士的老闆，目瞪着斷續的說：：「他們都有照的」！「這是什麽照，第二期的有什麽用？老早過期了。現在新照沒有領，你們是私吸；老闆等於私賣。你們統通到局裏去。」一個警士說着。他們忙着：「委員先生！我們弄到錢，馬上來調了的，請寬容一點」我將照一一檢查照以後，新領一個沒有。於是就叫他們卽刻領照，今天暫寬容一次，下次可不行的；並勸他們及早戒除，可是他們黑的面光己嚇得加上紫的一層。大象不約而同的目送我們出了他們所謂安樂窩。相信他們的心仍在跳動。</p>
<h3>一個小小建議</h3>
<p>— （嚴謹）</p>
<p>現在市面上。無論那一家商店，都標着「大减價」的字樣，從前尚分什麼春季大减價，秋季大减價，等名目，現在却終年大减價了。所以「大减價」的旗幟，也就同新開店的一塊招牌髣髴，不能或缺。假使開設一個鋪子必須備一面「大减價」的招牌，但是仔細一想，家家旣然大减價，呌顧客們無所適從，豈不等於家家不减價一樣，換句話說，也就沒有什麽標新立異了。在下的意思，何妨在這家家喊着大减價聲中，外若忽有一家商店，樹立起一塊「不减價」或「貨眞價實」「不折不扣」的牌子，那倒是一種別開生面的法子，但也能算誠實不欺，或許生意反因此興吒起來，亦未可知呢。（移酬助賑）</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第二十二回　俠語動脂唇羣姝集議　盧情驚玉腕苦女逃囚</p>
<p>他就向着北海笑道：可不是？我們太太在樓上聽了他一家人在樓下又哭又說，鬧得很可憐，就叫我跟着他們來打聽究竟。北海道：他們說了什麼呢？那人笑着搖搖頭道：老實人說話，沒有辦法，說得牛頭不對馬嘴，我也沒有法子向下問。我們夫人的意思，教我到他家裏去看看。可是我看他們實那樣髒，我眞不願進去。說到這裏，就回頭看了一看，低聲笑道：這是昨日在這裏和飯店裏人鬧了一回意見，太太不能不愼重一點子，所以先派我來看看。北海舉起手來搔了兩搔頭髮，笑道：假如藍專員能在贈裏作主的話，我我……說着，極力的搔着頭髮，接住道：我就出面來告一狀也肯。只是……他眼望了聽差，那聽着猛可的作了一個無聲的微笑。北海這就想着，這句話也許有點兒不懂事，便笑道：你先生貴姓。那人更是得意，立刻在身上掏出一張名片，交給了北海。北海看時僅僅是方大德二個字，同時，他自己也就看到了，立刻把名片抽了回云，另外卻給予了一張名片，這上面就有官銜了，乃是國民政府西北考察專員隨從員工友。北海原是覺得無話可說，借着問人家姓名，這樣轉了一轉，現在看到了人家的名片，就覺得不恭維不妥當，要恭維更不妥當；便笑着哦了一聲。方大德道：你先生很好，像那位周縣長的太太一樣……不，不，我的話，有些說楞了。那位周太太，非常之熱心，他剛才親自上樓去見我們夫人，說這個女人，可以救一救。兩個人談得一高興起來，說了很久，我們夫人老早就叫我和這兩個女人說話。說了許久總是不接頭，到了後來，也不知道什麽緣故，他們口裏叫着老爺，就向這後面跑。眞等我送着他們到了這後門口了，他們才說，惹小起作家爺的人，只好逃同去。我要追划他家裏去問話時，又覺得男女有些不便，只好站在這裏優望。（二七六）</p>
<p>本刋專訪</p>
<h3>葉聖陶氏訪問記</h3>
<p>— 笑先</p>
<p>為土　嚇詐信而給蘇州人發現出來的葉聖陶先生的消息傳出後，一般喜愛文藝的靑年們，震於「倪煥之」作者的文名，大家想一見這位在文壇上　負盛譽的作家。在一個陰雲密佈的下午，我同靜波君决計一訪這位在雜誌及書報上很熟習的作家。弄淸楚了葉先生的住址，我們便靜悄悄地向葉府出發了。入滾繡坊，轉入靑石弄，巷子裏極幽靜而陰森；垃圾桶，茅草，高墻頭，一切的景象和平常一樣，死沉沉的躺在那裏。尋到葉府的黑漆大門，按了門鈴，一位和善的中年太太出來開了門，滿臉掛着和氣：「找葉先生？請進來嘘。」一口本土口音接着讓我們二個小夥子進了鬥；屋裏迎出了一位中年人，光着頭，眼裏帶着笑：「在下就是聖陶。」一陣寒喧後，葉先生仲讓我們到他書室裏。書架上擱滿了許多綫裝的洋裝的教育，文學，哲學的書籍，書桌上攤了幾張本地報和申報。喝了些茶，我們便相繼問了許多文壇上的情形和成名作家的消息。葉先生誠懇的答應了我們。他說起話來，常常帶着微笑，不戴眼鏡，不留長頭髮，簡單而樸素，和他的作品一樣。他沒有文學家的騙傲氣，沒有藝術家的做作奧味，一切都是簡潔，爽快，和平常人一樣。我們繼續談着各人現實的生活情形，文人的出路；於是葉先生帶了感歎的口氣說：「中國的文人是沒有出路的！賣文章的生活是非人的生活，一位忠實於文學的靑年，從學習到修養，從練習寫作到發表作品，中間賣去了漫長的時日，然而你若能寫寫或報館雜誌肯接受你的作品時，你想脫離了身外職業來完成你的工作，這生活的希望，等於零！而且在外來的種種壓逼，不能完成你的願望。像巴金，田漢，丁玲，許多人就是一個例。何况你想搖了一枝筆，賣幾個錢來滿足你的肚子，就會餓死！然而中國的文化何嘗不需要這輩來創造呢？……」我們又問了些葉先生做教員時的生活，和現在的生活概况，寫「倪煥之」的動機，大衆語，漢字拉丁化等許多問題，承蒙葉先生很眞摯的一一回答了我們。書桌上一隻小鬧鐘毫無倦意地馱走了寶貴的時刻，葉太太又迎進了一大批女靑年，我們便在難捨的感情下告辭了葉先生，告別了這所簡樸淸靜的書齋。在寒風細雨中，趕着我們的旅程，而這位誠摯的作家，在我們腦中留了個永不磨滅的印象。</p>

<h3>百病治療新學說</h3>
<p>— 編者譯</p>
<p>晚近各國醫學家。對於種種病症發生之原因。起一新的觀念。具有至理。以為病症所發現之諸種症候。乃身體內天然　護之能力。與外界對內侵襲者交戰之結果。換言之。卽身强者抵抗病魔之力亦强，常能使重症化輕。輕症化無也。惟體內原有之抵抗力，視各人體質之優劣，遺傳及環境之不同。而有强弱之差別。故現時最新之治療方法。概注重於使病家體質漸趨强固。增進其抵抗力。而戰勝病魔。回復壯健也。斯丹那氏內分泌製劑「生殖素」。功能治病强身。使全身各部回復其正常之壯健。實適合此種原則。故能風行寰宇。而為著名醫家所樂用也云。</p>
<h3>戒烟福音</h3>
<p>— 任國祥醫師</p>
<p>片成癮之原理。蓋在人久久吸烟。中鴉片有害成份嗎啡與海洛因之毒。而此項毒質。能刺激神經及內分泌。使其起一時的興奮作用。於是人身遂呈愉快及振作之狀態。然移時卽轉麻痺。故非連續吸之不可。此成癮之原理也。</p>
<p>戒烟之難。亦難在吸者烟癮發作。大有生不如死之慨。故如有一種補劑。能消滅烟癮。掃除烟毒。而使人身神經及內分沁回復正常的振作。出於自然的愉快。則人又何樂於冒萬險蹈法網而沈溺於姻毒。斯丹那氏「生殖素」。不僅為上述合理的補劑。且有治病强身之功。故吾人用以調理病軀。戒除鴉片。收最美滿最完善之效果。洵戒者無上之福音也。</p>

<h3>電源變壓器檢騐</h3>
<p>— 浮萍</p>
<p>交通收音機最麻煩而容易引起障礙的，要算是電源變壓器，電源變壓的障碍，分析起來，不外乎下列幾點：</p>
<p>一，變壓器接上電源，次級高壓或低壓圈無電壓供給。</p>
<p>二，整流後的高壓，超過或不及標準數值。</p>
<p>三，變壓器過量發熱。</p>
<p>關於第一點障碍，當然是好用精確的交流電壓表來測量，但是這儀器不一定每個業餘者都能置備。現在我們祗須利用，家庭必備的電燈泡，便可解决許多難題。</p>
<p>把電燈泡（25，40，75，瓦特均可）先跨接在變壓器初級進綫兩端，開啟收音機開關，燈泡應發出全光度，這樣，表示輸入電源無誤。再將燈泡改為與變壓器初級相串聯，如圖一，收音機的眞空管完全拔去，使變壓器沒有負荷，這時經過初級圈及電燈的電流應極微弱，僅能使電燈發微弱的暗紅光，或竟完全不亮。第二步將每個次級綫圈逐一接成片刻的短路，此時電燈泡在個次級圈短路的一瞬間，應突然增加其光度，表示因負荷而增加的初級電流。這種暫時的短路試騐，變壓器不致燒毁，因初級有電燈串聯，足以限制過大電流。如果檢騐時，有一次級圈接成短路，電燈光度並不增加，卽可斷定該綫圈必斷綫，無電壓供給。在此整個的短路試騐過程中，設或電燈始終不亮，無疑的初級綫圈必中斷第二點障碍的癥結所在，當然是次級高壓圈的電壓不合，如果有交流電壓表示可測量，當然亦不成問題，但是沒有置備的，也可依圖二來解决。圖示係普通整流綫路，直流輸出處接一4mtd的濾波電容器，再跨接一高電阻的直流電壓表，此直流電壓示指示的數值，卽為變壓器次級交流高壓，（RMS值）的1，4倍。</p>
<p>高壓圈每一半的電歷，亦可在X或Y點拆斷，而分別測量之，兩邊測得的數值，最好相等，至多僅能容許有21/2％的差異，尚無大礙。</p>
<p>現在討論到第三點障礙，也是電源變壓器最易犯的病象。變壓器在工作時，因自身須損失一部份電力，自免不了發熱，但是發熱也有一定的限度。通常收音機電源變壓器發熟的安全限度，至多不得高出四圍空氣攝氏四十五度。</p>
<p>變壓器過量發熱。除了設計錯誤，及使用電壓不合外，其病因尚有（一）全波整流高壓圈兩半的電流相差過鉅，（二）有一個或多個次級綫圈過量負荷，（三）綫圈間短路。</p>
<p>病因（一）的檢騐手續，可以一千分安培表接在整流管每一屏極的接綫間，所測得的兩屏流，最好完全相等，至多不得相差過10％。如果發現相差過多，可交換變壓器至兩屏的接綫試之，設交換後，電流較小的一屏，仍為前之較小者，無疑的係整流管損壤。設因變腰器接綫的交換，電流較小的一屏亦隨之交換，自可斷定病在變壓器的中心分綫，不是準確的電壓中心點。</p>
<p>至於病因（二），大都由於使用者的不愼，使次級應用電流，超過變壓器製造者的規定值。在低壓圈，影響比較還小，但高壓圈關係極大，雖僅超出幾個千分安培，足以使變壓一器燒殷。例如60m．a．的高壓圈，而今應用用流為70m．a．，此超出的iom．a．雷流，約為規定值的17％。電流經過導體所生的熱效，與電流的平方成正比，所以此過荷電流足以使變壓器的熱度，超出正常狀態至36％，經久使用，自將破壞變壓器絕綠層而生短路危險。</p>
<p>如果變壓器發熱，經檢騐斷定並非由於上述兩種病因，則無疑的是屬於第三種短路不。關於怎樣測騐短路的發生點，不幸實在沒有簡單的方法。好在已經短路的變壓器，除了拆開修繞之外，也不會有更有效的方法來補救的。</p>
<h3>指向天綫的原理</h3>
<p>— 崇齡</p>
<p>無綫電報話交通，大多數是屬於單向的，一台與一台間都有固定的方向，故與無綫電廣播電台向四方廣播消息之多向的目的不同。為欲節省電力，减少損失，使電力集中向一方放射起見，為欲秘密消息避免他方接收起見，或欲增加台數减免他方向同波電台的擾亂起見，大規莫的無綫電話報話台，都有指句天綫（Kirectional　Antenna）的設備，以爲單向交通之用。例如國際間一國與一國的無綫電通報通話，即要利用指向天綫，為其單向發射與接收的工具。屬於這種單向的交通，發射台必須有發射指向天綫的設備，接收台也應具備接收的指向天綫。雖指向天綫的制度，各台不同，而天綫指向的基本原理，初無二異。</p>
<p>一根垂直天綫，通以高週率電流，便能放射電波於其周圍，藉以太以傳達遠處。這樣產生的電波，是依垂直於天棧的平面向各方散射，換言之，卽波塲的分佈可以天綫做圓心的圓形表示之，如圖一所示。a為垂直天綫，F為波塲，故在任何方向距離天綫相等的地方，電波的强度均相等。</p>
<p>如離天綫A半波長（入　）的地方樹立一同樣的垂直天綫b如圖二所示，天綫b所放射的波塲情形自與圖一所示無異。如天綫a與天綫b的電流為同相（Same　Phase）同週率，則在兩天綫ab所成的平面內，因b所放射的電波到達a時遲後於a所放射的電波恰為半波長，相差180度相角（Phase　Angle），故兩電波互相消滅；換言之，卽a的芷波與b的負波相和，a的負波與b的正波相加，故其結果為零.是故在ab兩綫的平面所示的方向，無電波發生.但在垂直於ab平面的方向兩無綫所　射的電波互相合趣來，而得一結合的波塲，形如「8」字，如圖二FF所示便是。故這種的設置，電波僅能由垂直於ab平面的方向放射，是為兩向的放射。（待續）</p>

<h3>關於「自動發電式的收音機」之我見</h3>
<p>— KMK</p>
<p>—自動發電的實騐經過—</p>
<p>—交流聲無法使之避免—</p>
<p>自前數期本刋將（鵑君所著的）「自動發電式的收音機」一文發表後，使我偶然回憶「實騐自動發電」而未獲良果的這回事，雖然從幻想而趨向實騐多少終有些靠不往的，可是研究家所尋獲的新發現，何嘗不是先從理想而開始實騐的呢？所以幻想亦確是新發現的發源地！</p>
<p>數年前，作者還在一家實業公司中（電氣機械科內服務時，）有一次，因大家閒着沒事，所以將一具（一管檢波，一管强力低放，一管整流，）交流三管機開着以作消遣，方開了不到十分鐘，突的眞空管都熄去了，這個弊病在我們公司裏是常常發生的，祗要在一部份的電流或是電機發生了障礙，則公司的電流就有同被截斷的可能，因此同事中有一位技術員首先提議由發電器（Dynamo）自己來發電，一方面可再不受電源截斷的影響，另一方面還能作一度實地的試騐，所以作者亦很贊同他的提議，可是該具交流機的進綫電源為二百二十弗打，倘自裝發電機以供給該具交流機，則勢必有相同電壓值的發電器不行，因為設計和耗費的不經濟，所以將該具交流機的電源電壓改成二十五弗打，共餘次級的電壓，電流與原來的相同，幾度設計，居然成功了，（綫路圖見圖Ａ），發電機為二十五弗打交流電源（25.v　A.C.　Dynamo），電力的能耐為二千瓦特（zo．Watts），在發電機的內圈（2）為原動機，其旋轉力利用發條盤聯以大小齒輪以旋動發電機，每分鐘旋轉的速率自四五。回至五〇〇回，構造與鵑君所述相似，不過旋動的負擔力須較强而已，不然在電源接上使用時，則原動力的傳動機勢必受發電機的重量負擔至久停頓，所以發電機的旋轉軸頒應須力求輕捷，而原動機傳動力更須力求强大，雖然自動發電的目的是達到了，可是討厭的交流聲以及雜聲却遮蔽了來的樂聲，無論怎樣濾波終不能將交流聲完濾去，這是美中不足的一個缺點，經過幾天的改裝，雖然交流聲是好得　　，工作　能　變　數　蓬去，　是進綫的電壓却嫌太低了；因為所低降的幾個弗打，是被幾個高週率的耗阻圈所阻去了，（見圖B的KFG，）為要將進壓充實計，因此將電源變壓器的初級改成二十弗打，這樣終算是大部份已吿成功了可是原動機的時間性，久之便覺得討壓，因為平均七八分鐘須將發條的搖柄撥轉幾下，不然收音工作就會停頓，因這些都是實地的經騐，所以將這次實騐經過，詳細的寫了出來，雖然發電器已經不成問題了，可是那具原動力的傳動機，却非改良不可，但所要改良的地方，就是須將時間性延長，（作者　將發條加長，可是傳動力却减弱了），不然幾分鐘須加緊發條一次‘還不是用交流電源，或是電池而來得簡便爽快嗎？</p>
<h3>直流與交流</h3>
<p>— 瓊</p>
<p>電流分有直流及交流兩種。電流在導體中流通時，其所流方向常一定不變的是為直流，如電池及直流發電機所產生的電流，卽為直流。圖A便表示直流。電流在導體中流通時其所流的方向常隨時間而往返轉變的，是為交流，如普通所用電燈的電流即為交流。交流的電流不但隨時間轉變其所流方向，且隨時間而變動其數值；此種電流起初由零漸漸增加至最高值，復由最高值漸漸减少至於零，然後反轉方向，在反轉方向再增加至最高值；復减少至零值。如此循環不息，卽如圖B所示一樣。由a至b是為一週（Cycle），由b至c也為一週，c至d又是一週。交流在導體中每秒所流週數，卽稱為週率（Frequency）。交流因其週率的不同又分為低週率（Low　frequency）電流與高週率（Higbe　frequency）電流兩種。例如普通電燈及電動機所用的電流，其週率有每秒60，50及25週三種；又如有綫電話所用來傳達聲音的電流常由每秒30週至10000週；因其週率較小，，故稱日低週率電流或成音週率電流（Audio　FrequencyCurrent）。至於無綫電天綫所流通的電流常由每秒10000週至100，000，000週，其週率極大，故稱日高週率電流或射電週率電流（Radio　Frepuency　Current）。常用的電池不能產生交流電；供給60週或50週的交流電是由於交流發電機所產生，交流發電機另為原動力的蒸汽透平（Steam　Turbine）所轉動。此種交流電亦可用來供給無綫電機電工率之用，，如供給眞空管的絲極及屏極的電壓便是。但無綫電機所產生的高週率電流，非尋常發電機所易產生，現在都是利用眞空管。</p>

<h3>男女淋病概論</h3>
<p>— （孫輯五醫師）</p>
<p>淋菌之播殖作用。可以綿互到數年。在男子則潛伏於尿道後部。在女子則潛伏於頸管腺腔中。所以與患有淋病的人性交。其結果必至釀成不幸的疾病。此徵諸病毒菌之性質。及其傳染力之盛旺。即可明瞭。男子生殖器之被淋毒菌侵入。通常就起尿道炎。假使侵入女子的生殖器。則因其生殖器之搆造。較諸男子為複雜。而且富有黏膜。最易惹起頑强而有害之諸般病症。而鄰接之臟器部份。亦易蒙其影響。故男女任何一方患有淋病後。卽須受醫生之診療。必能早期痊愈。否則男而染女。女亦染男。如此相互傳染。其病毒之烈。有不勝言者。惟擇醫宜愼。攝生有法。療治須得當而合理。旣不可因循。又不可盲從。若本埠法租界寗波路六十四號。孫緯才父子醫院。聘有經騐醫師。專治淋病及花柳等疾息。素為病家所信仰。療淋利器如短波透熱電機。提亞斯電機。無不完備。診室精雅。男女皆隔別治療。尤屬便利也。</p>
<h3>痤瘡興面皰</h3>

<h3>白帶新藥</h3>
<p>— （沈慶懷女醫生）</p>
<p>婦女於月經時。不知衛生。或患淋病。經久不愈。以及血虧。體虛。房事過度。精神刺戟。感冒等。均足致起白帶之症。若尙因循自誤。不求醫治。則白帶愈下愈多。患處腐爛。身體逐漸衰弱。皮膚蒼白。容顏枯稿。胃納不佳。大便秘結。遂足以惹起種種疾病。不易受胎。卽使受胎。亦易流產。我國婦女。拘於禮敎。旣罹斯疾。含羞不肯醫療。遷延日久。則至釀成子宮病。輸卵管病。卵巢病及下腹脹痛等症。殊危險也。今上海法租界甯波路六十四號。王預初女醫生診所。有內服白帶丸及外用白帶藥二種。性質和平。功效偉大。能治混淋菌白帶與單純白帶。老幼咸宜。孕婦不忌。價目每種每盒各售洋二元。證諸予之臨床實騐。用敢介紹於全國諸姑姊妹也。</p>
<h3>遺精與嗣育之關係</h3>
<p>— （孫為瑞醫師）</p>
<p>世之艱於嗣育者。多歸罪於女子。實則男性之種種疾患。亦與有關係也。遺精卽疾患之一種。其體質虛弱。姑置弗論。乃影響於嗣育者甚大。據醫學家用顯微鏡檢騐。患遺精者。多發育未成熟之情蟲。蟲極透明。僵臥而不活潑。　無行動能力。頃間卽斃。虫之皮膜。或斷或縮。頭部小。身屈如折斷狀。或尾部綣曲。奇狀怪形。種種不一。初病之人。尙無他異。及後。精液溷濁漸稀。睪丸之分泌物。逐漸减少。精虫絕無而僅有。卽羼入少數。亦至不健全也。精虫不健全。生產卽困難。幸而生產。兒亦不强健也。然則有遺精疾患者。可不及早治療乎。關於治遺精之成藥能迅速奏效而全無副作用者。要以『海爾邦』藥丸為最適合。此蓋屢經我儕臨症所實騐。足以信賴也。（編者按。『海爾邦』為上海法大馬路西新橋街德行里一號。同仁西藥社所經售。價每瓶二元。確為治一切性神經衰弱之特效劑。敢附數言。聊當介紹。）</p>

<h3>面麗治省斑奇騐</h3>
<p>— （顧養吾來稿）</p>
<p>余姊及余。皆患雀斑。或云先慈所遺傳。質之醫師。則謂皮膚色素沉着。無從排洩而顯著於表皮云。然求治數月無良效。坊間治斑藥。亦曾搽用。然褐斑猶然。今秋余姊歸寗。見其容顏潔凈。白潤紅膩。逈非昔比。異而詢之。則但笑不答。徐於其行篋中出一物示余曰。此『面麗』之功也。吾弟曷搽用之。行見與儂有同樣之容顏發見也。余將信將疑而受之。每日如法搽二三次。不半月果斑點悉除。見余者咸為驚訝。不意余姊弟自幼所患之雀斑。乃竟賴『面麗』而治愈也。不敢自秘。爰錄投本刊。</p>

<p>阿片為害。盡人皆知。尤以我國文弱之邦。平時旣不講求運動。又缺乏衛生常識。身體抵抗薄弱之婦女。每易染病。病旣初染。又不急於正式就醫。動輒以阿片為治病之萬能。因而日久成習。更有身罹暗疾。醜於就醫。往往藉阿片以解除痛苦。終則成為必不可缺之嗜好。亦有因環境之關係與社交之惡劣。戲弄成癮者。實亦屢見不鮮。至於因家庭間之為難。或欲避外界之物議而秘密私吸。吾知我國婦女。亦大有人在。然而値此國難頻危。欲求强國。必先强種。强種之途。婦女懷孕。實有直接之關切。况乎當今政令森嚴。男性之有惡習者。果宜勇往直前。决心戒絕。而婦女之染此者。證諸上述情形。當决不在少數。深望女界同胞之有阿片惡習者。爲身計。為家計。為國計。咸當知所驚惕。而速下决心以戒除之。庶得種賴以强。國賴以康矣。（編者按。上海法租界寗波路六十四號佘震醫師。對於戒煙一門。經騐豐富。受戒者。毫無痛苦，每天連注射內服。總共收費祇二元之離。若住院者。則取費亦甚低廉也。）</p>
<h3>胃痛與胃病</h3>
<p>— （顧振羣醫師）</p>
<p>胃痛非病名。乃胃病之症狀。種種胃病。皆足以引起胃痛。如胃炎。胃潰瘍。胃癌腫。胃神經疾患。胃酸過多症等等。無不以胃痛。以示其病程。凡患上述諸胃病之一者。咸有胃痛之苦。胃痛初發。即胃病初成。尤以胃潰瘍與胃癌腫二症。預後殊屬不良。胃痛尤為顯著。療治之法多端。要而方之。飲食物之攝生。藥劑應用之適合病情。是為必要。如果因一時胃痛之劇。輒以麻醉止痛之劑。以求暫時之舒適。于病本果無實益。而日久成習。尤足以妨害病體。惟『胃必靈』之治胃痛與胃病。不籍絲毫麻醉毒品。適合于胃內生理的分泌機能與消化素情况。故其療治胃病之範圍旣廣。而收效尤偉且速也。吾願胃病者。其愼于醫藥也可。（編者按『胃必靈』一藥。確為治胃病之聖品。聞每盒售洋一元。上海法大馬路。西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁西藥社。獨家經售云。）</p>
<h3>淋病之醫療方針</h3>
<p>— （羅敏修醫師）</p>
<p>淋。俗稱白濁。男可以染女。女亦可以染於男。大都男子由狎妓而來。初起為急性時期。放尿疼痛。尿意頻數。不知衛生。一旦染及妻孥。則雙方均蒙不利矣。淋病於急性時。治之猶易。若延成慢性。則醫治必需時日矣。法租界寗波路孫緯才父子醫院。備有諸般治淋電療機械。及早往治。無不速痊。蓋電療對於淋病。為近世最良之治法也。如病已染及妻妾。則宜雙方同治。諼醫院聘有女醫生。專門醫治女界隱疾。並隨時用顯微鏡檢騐病惰之經過。如有羞於就醫。或女界之不願就醫者。萬不能使病態之擴大。則自療之法尙矣。自療之法維何。可向上海法租界。西新橋街。德行里一號。同仁西藥社。購服『哥那多登』丸。該藥有極强大之透膜殺菌力。而無絲毫碍胃等之副作用。男女皆可服用。每匣僅售二元。有服一二匣。卽可斷根者。誠首屈一指之良藥也。余處方時。恒用斯藥。每奏良效。因作簡略報吿。以供同好。</p>

<p>談言</p>
<h3>寡婦墮胎</h3>
<p>— 子南</p>
<p>日前本報有一則不為人所注意的新聞：「寡婦王陸氏，不甘獨守孤幃，與同族之遠房叔公發生關係，因珠胎暗結，已歷四個月，恐被人窺破，與己小利，乃托詞娘家弟媳生產乏人帮護為由，徵得戀人同意，向某收生婆購得哦胎藥吞服墮胎，致內部受傷，醫治無效身死。」</p>
<p>這新聞的不為人注意，照我猜想，大概不外以下兩點：一，這種被封建社會所殺害的事情，已司空見慣，王陸氏的死，祗是滄海一粟。二，墮胎而死的主角是所謂「風姿猶存」的「半老徐娘」，並不是「二八年華」的「不俗無郎」的「小姑」，這在讀慣黃色新聞的讀者，在讀慣不厭其詳的「誘姦」「强姦」新聞之餘，便覺得不够「刺激」。</p>
<p>然而，這憫寡婦墮胎問題，却沒有被忽略過去的理由的。</p>
<p>在復古的惡傾向非常猖獗的現在，我們這個奇妙的資本主義化的封建社會裏，女人從一而終的繚銬，還正是魔鬼們最大的武器，從封建社會裏長大，並且是在封建的環境裏生活着的王陸氏，她自然無從反抗起，（這裏的問題不僅是敢不敢反抗，並且是知道不知道該不該反抗的問題。）因之，在一方面禁不了本能的要求，一方面又不敢公然向舊禮敎作戰的矛盾中，在所謂「珠胎暗結」之後，便祗有設法消滅「與己不利」的「孽根」之一法，雖然明知這是一個莫大的危機，但欲與封建社會妥協，便祗有把生命來當孤注了，</p>
<p>在這種狀態下，千千萬萬的女人們便悄悄地無聲無息地像王陸氏那般的死去。</p>
<p>在千千萬萬的女人悄悄地被迫死去中，「放大脚」的人們說了，寡婦與人私通，還情有可原，而墮胎，却是非嚴懲不可的！</p>
<p>墮胎是件罪惡的勾當，不錯！然而，誰願意把自己的孩子加以殺害的呢？就把孩子丟開不談，維又願意把自己作生命上的冒險？</p>
<p>然而，在封建社會中生長，又在封建的環境中生活着的無知的女人們，她</p>
<h2>Page 20</h2>
<p>們在封建勢力支配下，可不能不幹一下自己所不願幹的「嬰兒殺戮」，她們可不得不幹一下生命上的冒險！</p>
<p>是的，這些無知的盲動，又是「放大腳」的人們作爲振振有詞的最大理由：她們難道不可以不墮胎嗎？</p>
<p>不墮胎，這是求之不得的一事兒。然而，一個從封建社會中生長又生活在封建的環境中的寡婦，她知道了舊禮教的不合理，她有勇氣敢向舊禮教反抗的時，她早巳不會被從一而終的鐐銬所鎖住，她早巳不守寡而嫁人了。</p>
<p>雖然，嫁人之後，還難保不因爲生活的逼迫，而依舊墮胎或甚至嬰兒殺戳。</p>
<p>且慢講些冠冕堂皇的「官話」，先睜開眼來看一看這是怎樣的一個社會吧！——在這個社會裏，寡婦是不會消滅的，而寡婦的有孕之後，也不曾不有「罪惡的」「不人道」的墮胎事件産生。</p>
<h3>女神</h3>
<p>— 江嚴作</p>
<p>這野人之羣，他們商議着要到冊後雲參戰，他們抱着毛頭隨着風頭倒的宗旨，預備去估兩頭的利祿。（十二）</p>
<h3>上海的貨聲</h3>
<p>— 寒村</p>
<p>周作人先生得到過一本很有趣的書、叫做「一歲貨聲」，中間是記述京都一年來的各種叫賣的聲音，就寫成了一篇就叫「一歲貨聲」的出色的散文，後來他更譯了一篇達爾文時代的倫敦的叫賣聲的記述文章，叫做「一歲貨聲之餘」，這篇翻譯，各創作同樣的出色。</p>
<p>上海是中國最大的商業都會，各種叫買的聲音，自然更多，每天上午，街堂裏飛揚着菜蔬的叫買聲，這種叫賣的人，以近郊的農夫農婦居多，所以，帶了很重的澀意，無論多少年的賣蔬菜者，他們還脫不了農民的怯弱，就是和賣主們爭秤爭錢，也總是帶着可憐的求乞的聲調和語氣。</p>
<p>因爲遏止睡得較遲，醒來每在八九句鐘之間，猛然聽得幾聲買菜的聲音「芹菜……雞毛菜……」立刻感到一般濕意，好樣決定外邊在下雨，有一個買菜的人，挑着担，戴着舊草帽，一點點的雨水從他的草帽簷上菜担上滴下來，而他却慢慢向隔得很遠的街門口走去。</p>
<p>清晨賣菜，本來是普通小城市里「趣味」。（我說是趣味）在上海，只有較舊式的弄堂裏才有，因爲小菜塲逐漸多起來，那種哄然的雜音，早巳掩沒了帶有濕意的現時更帶有澀意的叫賣聲了。</p>
<p>下午，在衖堂中，普遍的傳着的是雜貨的叫買聲，從襪子鞋子，直到糖果捲烟之類都有，叫買的人，似乎以寗波人和本處人爲多，他們毫無質樸的氣度，他們的叫聲，是十分平庸，全尚有半點高低，同時反復地老是喊着豫先編好的押韵七字句，實在使人討厭，不但如此，叫買的人，總是且走且喊，而他們偏把東西放在一個地方，同時兩個人站在旁邊，帶着鴨嘴帽，耳朵上夾着捲烟輪流的喊，耐性又好，聲音又大，往往會一刻鐘的在我的窗下喊，正是一條橫衖和一條直衖的交叉處，因此，就成了這種小販的共同目標，此去彼來，用同一個聲調在喊。</p>
<p>下午夕陽柔和的照着，我點着枝烟，翻一本什麽書在讀，正讀到好處，忽然這種帶着流氓和騙子氣的叫聲一起，就無法使自己不跑出去了。</p>
<p>陰歷取消了，都市的人，就不大再容易記得，然而每到陰歷的月底和十四日，街上就有一種買「長錠」的女人來叫買，豫備人家初一十五祭祀用，特別是晚上，叫買的更多，她們厐教師近郊的農婦的副業，所以，叫買的聲音，也一樣，淒涼而寂寞「要　長錠……要　長錠……！」在夜深時一個人聽着往往要流淚！</p>
<p>在各種叫買聲中，最給人豔稱的是買花聲，因爲花本來是豔麗的，而呌買的人又是青春少女。在上海，上午也有插瓶花白蘭花之類的叫買，叫買的人，也確是女子，但好的力量不及「買長錠」的，能夠震撼我的魂魄，因爲在我腦海中，有一個買花應該在小城的清晨的觀念；曉烟未開，太陽方纔射着最高樓上，一條長的小巷，一個買花女子，曼聲的喊着過去，忽然小巷左邊的一扇樓窗開了，一個垂髫小婢，清冽的減住了她，然後由窗中用細的彩繩吊下一隻小籃和錢來，那個買花女，就拿了錢把花放在籃裏，等到花已經到了窗中，窗接着就關了。而那個買花女，再漫漫的向前，曼聲的喊買！至於上海，能夠釀成這種趣味的環境都尚有，就是柔婉的買花聲，也引不起我的幻想。</p>
<p>最後我還想記述一種聲音，那就是買小孩子的間聲，冬天，窮得毫無辦法的婦人，在夜深時帶着哭的嗚咽，喊着「買小孩買小孩」，因爲叫的人，都不是本地人，所以，不大有人懂，因此也不大有人顧問，而這聲音，我無論到那裏也忘不掉的。</p>
<h3>禮儀</h3>
<p>— 蕭斐</p>
<p>記得小時候跟隨長者去應婚喪喜慶的大正經，不過湊湊熱鬧，看看喫喫，對於尋種禮儀跟人亂一陣就算完。一等大了些，可就怪樣，應酬工會是必要的，假面具也得套上去，虛手段也做得出，有時候得代表長者或者自己立塲去應世故，那種塲面裏若不是懂點禮儀，不但自己感到四處不是，就是別人的冷眼裏也輕笑，說孩子不大懂禮貌，不配做人，甚至辱及長輩，那自然尚有家教啦！雖則那並不是實在，或至一套空架了而快了。在惡毒的潛勢力尚躲着的時候，誰也不大胆打破這舊籠子。我是鄙卑譏唾這徒重形式的欺人巳的事，無形之中，有隻罪惡的黑手抓我進了古舊的圈套裏。很知道有很多人是那樣畸形的生活着，若是每個人不想再勇敢些，要平淡地滑過一生，想起有點怕。但是無意之中，却懂了一點婚喪喜慶大正經的禮儀，那不是可誇口的經歷，只給我攻擊的是參考，預備別一天的戰鬥。</p>
<p>家鄉的風俗，凡是幹大正經事的人家，必須代替客人付掉來去的車力，原　着一個「請」字的意味，却算合　的。在開弔或做壽的人家，全得準備酒席之外，另外備着麵點。爲了有車力和點心喫飽肚皮，一輩好閒的人，候到一個機會，去應酬一下，既代付了車力，又省了點心不論認識與否是不管得，若是一天裏有三五家還可以想法賺一點錢，趕塲子的也有並非散閒的人，那裏我們看見的幫忙幫閒的真面目。</p>
<p>倘使是開弔，做孝子的真不容易，當一個弔喪的來，是要回禮的，鞠躬還他鞠躬，跪拜還他跪拜，親友一多真有些累，何況有許多別的事，要他親身去幹，覺得喊精神懊傷的人，再幹那不實在的事是惡毒而巳。有許多類似的慣習是不近情理，所謂禮儀反而將人真的靈魂壓制了！但這扇丟掉閉緊的黑門，一旦有人想打開，是與大衆有益的，有人還板起面孔，伸起拳頭，自然拳頭我們也是堅強的，抗爭是必要的，祇要多用點力，前面的對敵是經不起攻擊的的，虛假的禮儀我們不要，要的是正誠的情感喲！</p>
<h3>讀曹禺的雷雨</h3>
<p>— 趙深</p>
<p>文學季刊一捲二號上刊有曹禺的「雷雨」，近來不約爾向的有好多地方都在這演戲劇，如東京如北平如蕪湖，均先後上演，最近上海復旦劇社也將「雷雨」上演了。</p>
<p>這是一部難得的戲劇，創作態度的嚴肅和三一律的遵守不說，對就氣分的陰鬱，定命淪的表現以及遺傳的證明都足以被認爲自然主義的傑作。</p>
<p>在結構上也是很巧妙的他想寫一個了頭的觸電而死，却先寫花圃裏花架上的電綫失修。</p>
<p>可是他怕露出破綻，又故意再努力寫僕人屋外的大水，這樣佈起來，使得看戲的人猜不凖究竟這了頭的結局是要觸電而死，還是沒投水而死，結果投水不爲有照應，觸電却有了下文，要讓凡手來寫，大水一節是不會添上的。</p>
<p>劇中的周冲曾說了一大段話，含着未來的新生的希望，帶有象徵的意味，使人想起柴霍甫的「櫻桃園」。</p>
<p>倒數第二幕一痊老僕說了幾句話，像是基督教裏的牧師，這樣傳道的批示在西洋劇本中是常可看到的，徐志摩的「卞崑岡」不也是有一個彈三弦的瞎子麽？</p>
<p>首尾敘老年，中間爲正文，敘青年時事；把德國施篤謨的小說「茵夢湖」的方法用到戲劇裏來，甚爲新穎，簡陋的我是第一次看到。</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>總之這劇本的作者，如非　謁並精研歐洲戲劇，決寫不出這樣成熟的著作。臨了，找預祝此次復旦萬福演劇的成功。</p>
<h3>碼那地的故事</h3>
<p>— 孫娜</p>
<p>（Manila生活雜寫篇）</p>
<p>兩年前我得了洲府一位友人的介紹，到瑪那地鎮的一家中國小洋貨店去當三等夥計。這鎮靠近海邊，有一條三四十家店鋪的街道，和一個水門汀的小菜塲，一切都很灰暗而且沉悶，人們無精打采地拖䙽腳跟在走，小孩子們則都樂著屁股邊跳邊唱的在街心穿梭著。</p>
<p>到了黃昏的時候，街上便漸漸的熱鬧起來，甚至連那些白天不知道躲至那兒去，而現在却成群結隊地，胸前掛著六弦琴，邊走邊唱的青年們也出現了。他們用著淒豔的聲調唱道：在那美麗的甜睡中，我夢見你一戀人啊，而在街中那家廣東　包店，却也常要在這時聽到有人滿嘴濺着口沫，大聲咒着，叫着，他們往往似乎都是爲着一邊要賒欠，另一邊則抵死不肯所引起的糾紛。同時在一家菜仔店（註：一）老馬車夫扶太洛伯伯也出現了，他這時已經是醉眼松惺的倚在那長櫃台上，而手里却還高擎着酒盃，昂着頭，望喉嚨里直注的灌下去，直到花去了他袋子里的最後一個小錢，才戀戀不捨的把盃子放在櫃台上，把嘴望袖口抹，慢慢的跑出店。</p>
<p>這個扶太洛伯伯，在鎮上是被譽爲資格最老的馬車夫，據說在十六歲那年，做一日和尚撞一天鍾趕着一匹瘦得可憐的駌馬，和一架破篷車出去；而到現在他已經是五十二歲了，在這三十六年中他從沒曾間斷過他底神聖的業務，不過在他結婚那年的第一個聖誕節，爲着上帝的原故他確曾停過的。在他底家庭里有一個瞎子老婆，一個十七歲的女兒和十二歲的兒子，但是當人家提起他底那個寶貝也似的女兒時！</p>
<p>里娜！他便要閃動着他底錯老的眼睛，可是祇　一會兒便又淒然了：是一個出色的女孩子，可是窮困毀了她！……</p>
<p>在我們店里的那位頭手夥計也常這樣的；但是鎮里却誰都對她沒有好感。她是一個矮矮個兒，還沒脫　去稚氣的小姑娘，常當老板打午盹去時，便跑到我們底店里來胡混，頭手曾暗暗的告訴過我，他們是有過來去的。</p>
<p>她常會在一個固定的時間，幽靈也似的踏着尬尷的步伐，在街中像烟的一般輕渺，一會輕輕的飄過來，一會又輕輕的飄過去，沒間斷地在我們底店門外徘徊着，直到頭手向她使眼色，撈嘴巴，才敢在遠遠停住腳，掉頭向四面觀望着：有尚有巡捕或蠐探；於是便輕輕的跨開步，跑進我們底店里來。頭手忙也站起來接住她，又向我悄悄吩咐了九句，才帶着她進棧房去。這樣過了個把鐘頭，他們又重新出來，里娜從棧房里帶著她底代價，而頭手則對我裝鬼面。</p>
<p>因了我忠於保守她們偷竊，荒淫的職務，頭手便絕口的稱我爲誠實的夥子，而且每當關了店的時候，便邀我上街尾的一家飲冰室里去。</p>
<p>他常是高舉着他底咖啡盃兒，昂頭望喉嚨里灌了半盃之後，便快活的大聲笑道：「說起做人，是必須互相講交情的，比方你和我：像那些口是心非的傢夥，今天和你說蜜兒般甜，明天翻起面來又是另一個樣兒，恨不得一刀便把兩斷的，我便看他不起……」</p>
<p>我點了點頭，又在咖啡盃里輕輕的啜了一口，接着他又談起里娜來了。</p>
<p>「里娜，你說她不走正路嗎？那你便錯了，她是一個十足的好女人，可是窮困毀了她。對於她，像老九司那混蛋的看法，是永遠也看不出她底好處的」。提起老九司，我倒記起一件事情了。那是在三四個月前，里娜和他店里的一個頭手稿上，他老人家說，她偷了他棧房里的東西，便叫暗探把她送上區巡捕房里去，之後，她被控秘密賣婬在牢里關了兩個月才放出來。</p>
<p>「你要知道，當一個人窮得尚有辦法的進修，是顧不得面皮和名譽的」。法律是不適合於餓肚子的人啊她爸現在老了，也變的胡塗，趕馬車討不得法，而她們一家大小每個人都需要麵包去填肚皮的，那叫她怎樣辦呢？……」</p>
<p>我點了一點頭，又伸長著嘴巴向咖啡盃里啜了一口，接着搶又感傷地歎了一聲：「所以她永遠是對的」！</p>
<p>這是夜已經深了，街上悄靜得　於死寂，澈夜抱着六弦琴成群結隊的年青人，也在街角的陰影處消失了。</p>
<p>頭手慢慢的站起來，跑到櫃台邊去會鈔，我們便都出來了。</p>
<p>註一：菜仔店即是小什貨店的意思，麵包連帶酒類都賣的。</p>
<p>編者按：趙景深先生的「讀曹禹的雷雨」因送來較遲，昨日未能排出，故巳見昨日晨曦「影譚」及「藝海」。</p>

<h3>巴黎開映「春風秋雨」</h3>
<p>霞飛路巴黎大戲院，自今日起，開映克勞黛考爾白主演之「春風秋雨」，該片曾轟動一時，久炙衆口，劇情之悲哀，多情人觀之亦當同聲一哭，愛觀苦情片者，幸勿失之交臂。</p>
<h3>桃花夢繼時勢英雄而公映</h3>
<p>上海有聲影片公司但杜宇導演之桃花夢聲片，由殷明珠導領海上名歌星舞星數百人參加表演，富麗奇詭，不可名狀，眞可謂粉腿與舞帶齊飛，人面共花光一色，寓意尤極深刻，確爲不可多得之傑構，准接時勢英雄片在金城公映云。</p>
<h3>「雷雨」演出贅語</h3>
<p>— 封禾子</p>
<p>經過了一番相當的苦心經營，「雷雨」終不負幾個愛好藝術靑年們的熱心，從層層困苦中給奮鬥地達到演出，這一點自慰，應當是可以得着同好舞台藝術的人們的同情的吧？</p>
<p>這次幸蒙歐陽予倩先生担任導演。歐陽先生過去在導演舞台劇方面努力而獲得的成功，凡是愛好戲劇的人沒有不知道的；這次導演我們這稱非職業劇團，即使在演出上得到一分成功，然也抵不上他幾月來心血的擲付。</p>
<p>誰也知道非職業劇團的難於導演，不過，歐陽先生是認眞的，在排練的時候從來不給我們有一點疏忽，如果某一個演員在排練之時懈怠了他自己以至影響到整個空氣的話，他會得正色地說：「我不排了！」因此沒有一個演員敢於玩忽了他本分內的工作，而歐陽先生這種精神是深爲我們感服的。</p>
<p>排練了差不多有四個月之久，歷時不能算不長，不幸的是在預算要演出的前一星期，擔任周萍一角的吳鐵翼君，得家中母親病危的急電不得不離申北返；差幸是急切中找到了顧得剛君替代，可是演出的日期却不得不因此拖延到今天。顧君在短短的時間中擔任這麽一個重要角色，自然是很辛苦的事，但以顧君的舞台經騐來說是沒有不勝任愉快的。</p>
<p>姑不論我們的努力是達到那一點，我們的確是盡了我們可能以內的力量了。我們不敢以此自滿，我們是敬待着嚴正的批評以求更高的改進！</p>
<h3>銀色雜筆</h3>

<p>鑒於華北情勢的日形緊急，北平學生的反對「自治」，聞上海電影界人士亦將有聯合宣言起來響應云、</p>
<p>或人預料：所謂電影界反對華北自治的宣言，恐亦不能產生，蓋一盤散沙，本以電影界爲最，鑒于聶耳之追悼會，可以思過半矣。又據樂觀者稱：則事關民族存亡，即使一盤散沙，即使「大亨」過剩，以一紙宣言，當可以無問題也。究竟如何？且看事實。</p>
<p>藝聲歲暮號中有「今年一輯，題貂公斑華曰：「今年拍照頂多而成績毫無的貂斑華。」因此對於「拍照」的人甚爲系念，因爲太辜負他「一片苦心」了。</p>

<p>Current Commentary</p>
<h3>The Future of Philippine Independence</h3>
<p>— Dao</p>
<p>Mr. Howard, a prominent figure in the American press, recently completed a comprehensive inspection of the Philippines. Based on his observations, he published an essay arguing that the Philippines would find it exceedingly difficult to detach itself from the United States economically upon achieving independence. He advocated for maintaining the current relationship between the United States and the Philippines, ensuring the Philippines remains perpetually in a state of autonomy under American protection. Mr. Howard also stated that, to the best of his knowledge, there were many individuals in the Philippines who shared this view. Therefore, if the United States could alter its approach and solidify a permanent association between the two countries, it would undoubtedly align with the sentiments of the majority of Filipinos. The present autonomous government of the Philippines has already been established. According to the current constitution, it is poised to attain complete independence in ten years. During this decade, the Philippines will remain under American protection and continue to engage in limited free trade with the United States, thereby minimizing any unforeseen economic disruptions. Mr. Howard's proposal entails extending this state of semi-independence, potentially shielding the Philippines from some degree of peril. However, whether the aspirations of the Filipino people align with Mr. Howard's depiction remains a question. Following the publication of Mr. Howard's essay, the incumbent President of the Philippines, Quezon, proclaimed that, regardless of the circumstances, the Filipino people would assume the responsibility of nation-building and would never entertain ulterior motives. Furthermore, according to a Reuters dispatch from the ninth, Mr. Romulo, a Filipino journalist and honorary doctorate recipient from the University of Notre Dame in the United States, declared with fervor, "In the event of war or any act of aggression, the Filipino people will resist to the death and will do so alone, without requesting the bloodshed of others." These statements by the two individuals serve to illuminate the psychological state of the Filipino people, who prefer independence, even amidst adversity, rather than securing a precarious peace at the expense of their national dignity.</p>
<p>Judging by the current circumstances of the Philippines, it appears difficult for it to survive independently without economic reliance on the United States. It also appears difficult for it to defend itself politically without American protection. But why did the Philippines fall into this situation? The American rule should bear a considerable responsibility. The United States has ruled the Philippines for more than thirty-five years, and the Philippines is still an agricultural country with little industry. The Americans only wanted it to be an appendage of the United States and did not prepare it for true independence. As for the difficulty of the Philippines to survive in terms of national defense, although it is a fact, it is difficult to say whether the United States has the determination to protect the Philippines. For example, those in the United States who worry about the US-Japan war often consider abandoning the Philippines as a good plan. They said that the Philippines protrudes too much, and once it is attacked by a strong country in the Far East, it will be difficult to defend itself. Rather than abandon it at that time, it is better to abandon it in advance. There are even Americans who only want to survive and say that the United States will inevitably have a US-Japan war once it is attacked by Japan if it keeps the Philippines. Therefore, they must advocate abandoning it early. How many Americans hold this view, let alone. However, it is obvious that the Americans may not have the determination to defend the Philippines, and the Philippines may not have a definite guarantee under American rule. In other words, the Filipinos must ultimately bear the responsibility for the economic and political life of the Philippines.</p>
<p>According to the Tydings–McDuffie Act, the economic life of the Philippines will still be connected with the United States in the next ten years, and national defense will also be protected by the United States. Therefore, it is not impossible to strive for economic construction and create a self-sufficient country during this period. As for national defense construction, although it is extremely difficult, the period of ten years is quite leisurely. If it can be done in a practical way, it may not be impossible to survive. Now that the Filipinos are not afraid of difficulties and are determined to take on the responsibility of nation-building, they should be allowed to do so. There is no need to worry too much. Even if the Philippines is unable to resist foreign aggression in the future, we believe that if the Americans really love the Philippines, they can avoid the form of rule and give aid to it as a friendly country. In this way, they can set an example for international justice and open a new chapter for world peace.</p>

More than ten people, including Xia Douyin, went to the airport to welcome him. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs dispatched a car from Section Chief Lu Qirong to greet him at the airport. After disembarking, Zhang went directly to his residence with Secretary Huang. That evening, he met with President Jiang to inquire about everything. Zhang told visitors that he had been away from Nanjing for two days and had not yet been briefed on the current situation. The date of his inauguration has not yet been determined. It is reported that all the other ministers will be inaugurated on Monday, and he will also be inaugurated at the same time. As for the future diplomatic policy, he cannot discuss it in detail at this time. He will follow the diplomatic policy declared by President Jiang at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee, which is "peace will not be abandoned until hope is exhausted, and sacrifice will not be lightly spoken of until the final moment." He has not yet heard whether there will be any changes to the two vice ministers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, but he hopes that both Tang and Xu, who are familiar with the diplomatic situation, will be able to assist him. As for rumors that Chen Yi will succeed him as Ambassador to Japan, they are inaccurate, as the matter has not yet been decided. His return to Hubei this time is to finalize all procedures within his term of office and to bid farewell to all parties. The candidate to succeed him as Chairman of Hubei Province has been internally decided as Secretary-General Yang Yongtai. He will visit President Jiang tonight to inquire further. In other news, after Zhang arrived in Nanjing, Vice Minister Xu Mo immediately visited him and arranged to hand over affairs on the morning of the 14th.

Xia Douyin and Liu Mingzhao, section chief of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and others went to the airport to welcome him. Zhang went to his residence for a short rest after disembarking, and then went to the Military Academy to pay his respects to President Jiang for a meeting. According to Zhang's conversation with reporters, at this time of national difficulty, he was ordered to head the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and could not refuse. He could only work hard and shoulder the heavy responsibility under the leadership of President Jiang. After assuming office next week, he will immediately begin his duties. Regarding future diplomatic policy, President Jiang's speech at the Fifth Plenary Session of the Central Executive Committee has already explained it in great detail. In short, it is to seek self-preservation internally and coexistence externally. There is no other policy. As for Sino-Japanese relations, the two countries share a common culture and race, and it is necessary to jointly maintain peace in East Asia. In the future, he will follow the instructions of the Central Government to seek the adjustment of all relations between the two countries. As for the position of Ambassador to Japan, he will soon select a suitable candidate to fill it. He has not heard of the rumor that Chen Yi will succeed him. He intends to invite the two vice ministers of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to continue to help. Regarding the Hubei Provincial Government, he has completed the handover procedures, and the successor has also been internally decided by the Central Government and will be announced soon. The current situation in Hubei Province is quite peaceful. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>

Wu, adhering to the principle that a politician should not talk too much, did not wish to express much. He said that in the past, as an outsider, he could freely criticize and contribute to all the government's measures. Now that he has been ordered to hold a position in the government, he can only bury himself in hard work and seek truth from facts. He is willing to welcome criticism and instructions based on the facts of his future performance. (Central News Agency dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The new Minister of Industry, Wu Dingchang, is residing in the Traffic Bank dormitory. He said that he came to Nanjing in a hurry and has not yet visited the authorities. President Jiang has scheduled a meeting with him at 8:00 PM, at which time he will ask for instructions on important issues related to the ministry. In recent years, in addition to assisting in some financial businesses in Shanghai, he has also been engaged in the news industry. In the past, he published his personal opinions on current affairs in newspapers. In the future, he will pay attention to practical work in politics, especially since the Ministry of Industry is in charge of agriculture, industry, and commerce throughout the country, and emphasis should be placed on practical work, which cannot be accomplished by empty words. Before assuming office, he is unwilling to advocate theories. His only hope at present is to gradually realize the urgent needs of various industries within the scope of the ministry. The date of his assumption of office will be determined after the other ministers are inaugurated. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>

(Special dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The new Minister of Interior, Jiang Zuobin, said that the chairman of this conference opened up freedom of speech and guaranteed public opinion. Newspaper opinion can gradually become lively and will see further progress in the future. He believes that administrative personnel and news practitioners have the same goal, which is to seek happiness and progress for the country and society. With the same basic principle as the starting point, they must eliminate barriers and adopt cooperation. He will pay attention to this when he arrives at the ministry, study and gradually find ways to improve it, so as to achieve effective cooperation. The date of his taking office will be determined after visiting President Jiang for instructions. The candidates for vice minister have not yet been determined. The Ministry of Interior handles civil affairs and is very important. All countries attach great importance to the Ministry of Interior, and its administrative scope, such as civil affairs, etiquette, police, land, and hygiene, is closely related to the organization of the state and the safety of the people. He has been abroad as an envoy for many years, and his mind is filled with international issues. Now that he has been freed from diplomatic duties, he will concentrate on internal affairs. Therefore, how to improve customs and rectify officialdom in the future will have to be studied in detail after arriving at the ministry before a decision can be made on what should be promoted and what should be reformed. Local autonomy has been decided at this conference to implement constitutional government next year, and it must be actively promoted to complete the autonomy work as soon as possible. Land policy is one of the important tasks of the party and will be vigorously promoted to complete the legacy of the Premier. The situation in the Chahar-Suiyuan issue should improve after Minister He goes north to resolve it. The Guyuan incident should not be expanded. In short, the Chinese people should be self-reliant in the future. Things must rot themselves before worms grow. Traitors should be purged. Traitors are due to the lure of other backgrounds. I don't know that no good family girl will be lured. Only when there is a way to lure them will people lure them. Therefore, it is impossible to delay to lift people up in the future. As for the candidate for the successor of the Ambassador to Japan, it has not yet been determined. The saying that Chen Gongxia is the successor is also speculation. It has not been determined when Counselor Ding will return to China. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>

<p>(Beiping) Baoding, 12th. Shang Zhen has decided not to take the position of Chairman of the Henan Provincial Government. On the evening of the 12th, in addition to telegraphing the Central Government to earnestly request the withdrawal of the order, he also telegraphed Liu Zhi, requesting that he not prepare for the handover. His telegram to the Central Government read: "I received a secretarial telegram on the 12th from Minister He's headquarters, relaying the National Government's order to appoint Zhen as a member and chairman of the Henan Provincial Government. I am deeply disturbed upon hearing this. Zhen has dedicated himself to the party and the country and has long put his personal advancement and retreat aside. Being transferred to Henan after resigning from Hebei only increases my unease. Moreover, after Zhen's troops move south, their reorganization and training are particularly important. I have no time to take care of provincial affairs, and I am concerned about the possibility of failure. I implore you to consider my sincerity and quickly withdraw the order. I submit this with utmost sincerity and await your decision." (Central News Agency dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Tianjin) The 141st Division (Song Kentang), 142nd Division (Lu Ji), and 139th Division (Huang Guanghua) of the 32nd Army under Shang Zhen have all been ordered to march on foot to the areas of Shunde, Baoding, and Xingtai in southern Hebei for thorough training.

<p>(Nanjing) Cheng Qilu, Shang Zhen's representative in Nanjing, told people that Shang resigned from his position as Chairman of Hebei Province in order to relinquish political affairs and focus on military affairs. Moreover, he has been exhausted by dealing with the difficult situation in North China for several months and needs to rest. This transfer to Henan goes against his original intention and he has telegraphed the Central Government to earnestly request the withdrawal of the order. Therefore, it is feared that his assumption of the new post in Henan will be difficult to achieve. (Special dispatch, 13th)</p>

The authorities here are all patriotic and the changes in personnel do not affect the unity of the country. I hope that you will convey to the students that they should bury themselves in their studies and not engage in extracurricular activities.

<h3>It is Not True That China is Dumping Silver in London, The Reason for the US Stopping Silver Purchases Has Nothing to Do With China</h3>
<p>(Nanjing) According to sources familiar with China's financial situation, the outflow of silver from China in the past was indeed due to the implementation of the US silver purchase policy. However, if China's international trade did not have such a large trade deficit, even if the world price of silver was high, silver would not have flowed out of China. The implementation of the new currency policy is only to prevent the public outflow of silver, in order to preserve the currency reserve that supports the country's economic lifeline, and to seek the permanent stability of currency and finance. The government has not only not prohibited the legitimate foreign exchange necessary for the international trade deficit, but has also ordered the Bank of China, the Central Bank, and the Bank of Communications to buy it without restriction. Because the three banks are ordered to buy and sell foreign exchange without restriction, they have to be active in the world silver market to meet the needs of domestic buying and selling of foreign exchange. China is one member participating in the London market, but it is not credible that it is dumping silver in large quantities. Moreover, after the implementation of the new currency policy, the silver collected by the government has been stored in the Issuance Reserve Management Committee and the sub-committees and sub-warehouses in various places. Not only has it not been transported out of the country, but it has not been concentrated in one port. The speculation of some foreign electricity sources about the reasons for the US government's cessation of silver purchases is indeed far from the facts, which we deeply regret.

<h3>Anglo-French Peace Plan: Abyssinian Government Refuses Acceptance; Unfair Conditions Impair Sovereignty; Applies to League of Nations to Convene General Assembly for Discussion; Full Text of Plan to Be Simultaneously Released in London and Paris This Morning</h3>
<p>(Geneva) Although the peace plan determined by Britain and France has been rejected by Abyssinia, it will still be confidentially distributed to each member of the Council of the League of Nations today. The full text will be released in London and Paris tomorrow morning. The Council will meet on December 18 to discuss the plan. The Abyssinian government stated when rejecting the plan that, according to it, half of Abyssinia's land would be given to the League of Nations and the other half would be incorporated into Italy. The Abyssinian government now suggests that a General Assembly of the League of Nations should be convened to discuss whether the terms of this plan are fair. It is now confirmed that the plan stipulates:</p>
<p>(1) Abyssinia, in exchange for access to the sea, either the port of Assab or the port of Zeila, at Abyssinia's choice, will cede all of the Danakil and Ogaden, and part of Tigray, excluding the city of Axum. Abyssinia will have full sovereignty over this access. Rumors that the Roman Catholic Church will send a special committee of nations to administer the city of Axum are unfounded.</p>
<p>(2) All of Abyssinia will be placed under the League of Nations as recommended by the Committee of Five. The League of Nations will assist in the administrative, economic, and financial reorganization of everything.</p>
<p>(3) Any officials not recognized by the Abyssinian Emperor shall not be appointed. The special rights of Italy recognized within the southern border, limited by 6 degrees north latitude and 38 degrees east longitude, allow Italy the right to immigrate and operate all businesses within this territory through registered companies.</p>
<p>According to well-informed sources, Abyssinia's reply has neither technically accepted nor rejected the peace plan, but has made a very complete reservation regarding Abyssinian sovereignty. It is also stated that if Abyssinia's request to convene a General Assembly of the League of Nations to discuss the fairness of the terms is heeded, then this matter will be taken over from the Council, as the General Assembly is the highest body of the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) The small nations of the League of Nations, in great anger, today forced the Committee of Eighteen to allow a detailed debate on the peace proposals of Britain and France during the plenary session of the Council on Wednesday, instead of entrusting the plan to the Committee of Five, which is controlled by the major powers. British Secretary of State for League of Nations Affairs Eden and French Premier and Foreign Minister Laval tried to avoid all discord, stating that the final solution to the Italo-Abyssinian issue must be acceptable to all members of the League of Nations. The Polish representative proposed today that the League of Nations should not take any action on the oil embargo before debating the peace plan. At this point, the Committee of Eighteen adjourned, and no agreement was reached on the oil embargo issue. (National Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<h3>Abyssinian Leaders Express: Ceding Territory Is Absolutely Unacceptable; Lions Will Never Allow Hyenas to Steal Their Food; Willing to Fight to the End to Fulfill National Duty; Someone Suggests to the Emperor to Allow the League of Nations to Handle It</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: The British and French ministers today separately submitted the peace plan to the Abyssinian Emperor. The Emperor's American advisor, Mr. Colson, took the latter plan to Taissy at 5:45 PM today to present it to the Emperor and discuss whether to accept or reject it. Later, according to unconfirmed news, the Emperor has telegraphed the League of Nations to reject the plan. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>Taissy City: According to our correspondent, after receiving the Anglo-French proposal to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, the Emperor immediately sent his American advisor, Mr. Colson, to the capital to meet with the British Minister to Abyssinia, Sir Barton. The meeting was completed this morning. The content of the meeting is unknown to outsiders. Mr. Colson has also taken a plane to this location to report everything to the Emperor. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to our correspondent, regarding the Anglo-French proposal to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, someone has suggested to the Emperor to allow the Council of the League of Nations to handle it, to determine whether the proposal violates the principles of the Covenant. The Emperor has adopted this opinion and will not consider firmly rejecting the proposal again. As for the Italian government's reply to the proposal, it is expected not to be active, but to attach various reservations. As for the issue of Abyssinia's access to the sea, in addition to allowing Abyssinia to choose between the Italian-owned port of Assab and the British-owned port of Zeila, the passage from the Abyssinian capital to the coast is also prepared to be given full sovereignty.

<p>(Paris) The Abyssinian Minister to France, Mr. Walta, stated today that "a lion cannot calmly watch a hyena steal its food. If we must resist the Italian army alone, we will fulfill our duty." It is understood that Abyssinia's opposition is due to the cession of land, which will cause the dissatisfaction of the northern generals. As for the Emperor, considering the power of Italian bombing and that disease and hunger have demoralized the Abyssinian army, and after inspecting the northern troops, he feels deeply disappointed and has not yet dared to issue an order to counterattack Magal. Therefore, the peace plan is also acceptable. It is learned today that the Emperor may soon return to the capital to discuss everything with his American advisor, Mr. Colson, while the Minister of War, General Gai Tai, the commander of the northern front, Sai Xiong, and Kassa are all advising him not to go to the front lines in person.

<h3>Italian Reply Still Pending; Must Report to Supreme Fascist Council Beforehand</h3>
<p>Addis Ababa: The British Minister to Abyssinia, Barton, and the French Minister to Abyssinia, Baudet, will submit the Anglo-French peace plan to the Abyssinian government tomorrow. The content of the plan will be telegraphed to Taissy to be relayed to the Emperor. Abyssinian leaders stated today that the Emperor will definitely reject any suggestions to cede land to Italy. (National Telegraph, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) According to our correspondent, Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's reply to the Anglo-French proposal may not reach the League of Nations before the Council meeting, because the Italian government must report to the Supreme Council of the Fascist Party beforehand. This meeting is scheduled to be held on the 18th of this month, coinciding with the scheduled date of the Council meeting. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Rome) A spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs recently made a statement to foreign journalists, instructing them not to be overly optimistic about the issue of peace between Italy and Abyssinia. He said, "The terms proposed to the Prime Minister by Britain and France should not be regarded as a proposal, but as a starting point for future negotiations. The Italian government should study it with sympathy and a steady spirit. If we are overly optimistic at this time, the progress of the work will be inconveniently affected."

<h3>League of Nations Council Scheduled for Next Wednesday; Considers Italo-Abyssinian Reconciliation Plan; Eden and Laval Returned to Their Countries Yesterday</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Anglo-French peace plan was considered at a closed-door meeting of the Committee of Eighteen this afternoon. British representative Eden advocated an open meeting, but it was not approved by the majority. The Polish representative suggested that all international affairs should be handled by the Council of the League of Nations, without transferring them to the Committee of Five, which was approved by the majority. Today, Eden gave a short speech at the meeting, saying that the peace plan negotiated by Britain and France is neither definitive nor inflexible. If there are suggestions for improvement, they are welcome. It is appropriate to convene a meeting of the Council of the League of Nations as soon as possible to listen to opinions from all parties on the peace plan and then decide on the direction it wishes to proceed in order to deal with the situation arising from this. If the League of Nations does not agree with the Anglo-French proposal, we will not complain. French Premier Laval agreed with Eden's proposal, and the committee adjourned until tomorrow. Tomorrow, it will discuss the report on the implementation of sanctions against Italy. Eden's speech before the Committee of Eighteen today has aroused many comments here. The Council of the League of Nations has scheduled a meeting for December 18 to discuss the Anglo-French peace plan. According to various opinions, there is very little chance of it passing. The sanctions report written by the expert committee has been distributed to representatives of all countries of the League of Nations tonight, stating that 50 governments have now implemented economic and financial sanctions against Italy, with excellent results. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(Geneva) British Minister Without Portfolio Eden and French Premier and Foreign Minister Laval both returned to their countries after the meeting of the Eighteen-Nation Subcommittee. As soon as the replies of the Italian and Abyssinian governments to the Anglo-French proposal arrive in Geneva, they should telegraph to come here on the following Wednesday, namely the 18th, in order to participate in the Council meeting. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) According to a report from the Geneva correspondent of the "Business Journal," the plan proposed by Premier Laval and British Foreign Secretary Hoare to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian dispute was revised once in Paris on Tuesday. (Note: British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Vansittart met with Premier Laval on this day to revise the plan.) The relationship is very important, and its content is: (1) Italy will cede the port of Assab on the coast of Eritrea, along with a corridor, to Abyssinia. This corridor should start from the coast and connect with the Abyssinian capital. (2) Not all of the Tigray province will be ceded. Abyssinia will only cede the northern territory, along with the cities of Adigrat and Aduwa, and the Tagaz River to Italy. (3) Abyssinia will cede the Ogaden province to Italy. (4) The rest of Abyssinia, including the area where Italy is allowed to colonize, should establish an international trusteeship system, supervised by the Committee of Five of the Council of the League of Nations. Italy has no right to recruit police in the colonized area. This plan will generally be announced in Geneva today. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Internal Opposition Rises in Britain and France; British Labour Party to Impeach the Government; Herriot Plans to Resign to Argue</h3>
<p>(London) The Labour Party will table a motion of impeachment against the government in the House of Commons within days, dissatisfied with the peace plan agreed upon by Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Premier Laval to resolve the Italo-Abyssinian War. The Liberal Party has tabled a motion condemning any resolution that infringes upon the territorial integrity and independence of Abyssinia. Six Members of Parliament who support the government will also table the same motion. According to news from Paris, those in France who advocate sanctions against Italy are now also gathering to oppose the peace plan. Both the Radical Socialist Party and the Socialist Party will use this opportunity to question the government. Liberal Party leader Samuel stated in a speech somewhere in London today regarding the peace plan that Hoare's move is the first major mistake in his tenure as Foreign Secretary. This proposal not only recognizes the gains of aggression, but also offers land that the Italian army has not yet been able to seize. The League of Nations and Abyssinia cannot accept it. (Reuters dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) According to a Reuters correspondent in the Parliamentary Lounge, many members of the Conservative Party and the Government Liberal Party are now making every effort to oppose the peace plan agreed upon by the government and British Foreign Secretary Hoare and French Premier Laval in Paris, and hope that the government will give a satisfactory explanation for this. They will temporarily maintain a reserved attitude. A delegation from the League of Nations Association, Viscount Cecil, Professor Murray, and Sir Austen Chamberlain met with the Prime Minister for 90 minutes today. They presented their opinions on the peace plan and urged the government to continue its policy of sanctions until it takes effect, and not to support any resolution that does not state that "aggression has gained nothing." Baldwin thanked the delegation for their contributions. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Minister Without Portfolio Herriot opposes the Anglo-French mediation plan for the Italo-Abyssinian dispute, and today he has a tendency to argue with his resignation. If Mr. Herriot puts his words into practice, the government will inevitably collapse, because Mr. Herriot is the leader of the Radical Socialist Party, and the Radical Socialist Party is the backbone of the government party in the Chamber of Deputies. (National Telegraph, 10th)</p>
<p>(Paris) Former Minister of Aviation and leader of the Radical Party, Mr. Cot, has today begun a movement among left-wing members of the Chamber of Deputies, demanding an immediate debate on foreign policy. Mr. Cot said that the current French policy on the Italo-Abyssinian dispute has sacrificed the nature of collective security and has the intention of allowing the League of Nations to reward the aggressor, which will weaken France's moral strength among the countries of the world.

<h3>U.S. Congressional Voices Dissatisfaction; Anglo-French Plan Rewards Atrocities; Contrary to the Purpose of the League of Nations</h3>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Senator Vandenberg today spoke out against the League of Nations and the Anglo-French peace plan, saying that we are now more convinced that the path to peace does not need to go through the cooperation of the League of Nations or its member states, because the League of Nations is a political organization, not a peace organization. The so-called peace plan is suitable for the needs of strong countries, but not for the purposes of the League of Nations. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>Italian Air Force in East Africa Bombs Undefended Areas; Italian Government Sends Message to League of Nations Denying</h3>
<p>(Geneva) The Italian government today sent a message to the League of Nations, formally denying that Italian aircraft had bombed any undefended cities or towns in Abyssinia, saying that the city of Taissy, which Italian aircraft recently bombed heavily, is one of the enemy's largest military centers. Italian aircraft flying below 4,000 feet were often hit by anti-aircraft guns, which is enough to prove the solidity of the city's defenses. The message also stated that on the day after Taissy was bombed, Italian aircraft saw red cross flags hanging everywhere in the city, even in military camps and airfields.

<h3>International Tea Production Conference to Be Held in London Next April; British to Implement Restriction Plan; Unfavorable to the Future of Chinese Tea</h3>
<p>United Press Hong Kong: According to a London telegram, the International Tea Committee will hold a meeting in London regarding the annual export ratio, which will be implemented from next April. Because British tea production has decreased in recent years, causing tea prices to rise, it is expected that the British ratio will increase by 25%, to 85%. Because of the sharp decline in Chinese currency, the UK will implement a restriction plan again, which is clearly unfavorable to the Chinese tea industry.</p>
<h3>Outer Mongolian Representatives Visit Russia; Japan Pays Unusual Attention</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs received a telegram from Ambassador Ota in the Soviet Union, stating that on the 11th of this month, three Mongolian representatives, namely the Chairman of the State Council of the Mongolian People's Republic, Kenton, the Minister of the Army, Demid, and the Director of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Nasalai, arrived in Moscow, intending to begin political negotiations with the Soviet Union. After the collapse of the "Manchukuo"-Mongolia conference, the fact that Mongolian representatives are directly negotiating with the Soviet Union has attracted Japan's great attention.

<h3>Naval Demands for Equality; Japan Becomes the Target of Public Criticism; United Front of Various Countries; U.S. Opposition Is Especially Strong; Naval Conference Adjourns Until Monday to Continue</h3>
<p>(London) According to our correspondent, representatives from various countries to the Naval Conference have expressed disagreement with Japan's claim for a "common maximum limit." Although the reasons they are based on are different, their opposition is the same. Regarding this, there is no room for reconciliation between Japan and the views of various countries. After the Japanese delegation discussed the replies to the various questions raised by other delegations yesterday, although each country did not fully understand Japan's intentions, the formation of a "united front" to confront Japan is an established fact. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) After the First Committee of the Naval Conference continued its meeting this morning, the Japanese representative and the representatives of the United States and other countries still failed to reach a compromise on their respective positions. The Japanese representative made two demands at today's meeting: (1) Abolish all warships with offensive capabilities; (2) Defensive warships should adopt a common maximum limit in order to achieve the goal of non-threat. The U.S. representative immediately refuted this, saying that the current naval balance of power is sufficient to prevent all threatening acts. Since Japan insists on maintaining the warships needed for its national defense, it demands that other countries abolish the various warships they need, which is not justified. The French representative expressed disagreement with the establishment of a common maximum limit by the three major naval powers of Britain, the United States, and Japan, namely maintaining the original proportional system. The Japanese representative said that if the common maximum limit method is jointly participated in by European countries, Japan will not oppose it. At this point, the representative of the Union of South Africa spoke, expressing his approval of the remarks made by the British representative yesterday, and said that this was done in the capacity of an autonomous country, rather than in the capacity of the British Empire. The Japanese representative immediately protested this statement, saying that if each autonomous territory has the qualifications of an autonomous country, the Naval Conference will be difficult to continue. The meeting was then adjourned, and no results were achieved on various matters. The chief representatives of the various countries are scheduled to meet separately on Monday afternoon to enable the work of the conference to make progress, because it has been a week since the meeting started and there is still no progress to speak of. (Havas dispatch, 13th)</p>
<p>(London) The Naval Conference discussed Japan's demand for equality for two hours today and decided to adjourn until next Monday to continue the discussion. (National Telegraph, 13th)</p>
<p>(Paris) The American newspaper reported that the French representative and other countries' representatives unanimously opposed Japan's request at yesterday's Naval Conference, but it is heard that this statement is inaccurate. The Japanese delegation's attitude is that issues involving the three major Pacific countries must be resolved first, and then European issues. The French delegation declared that France is not willing to see the precedent of the Washington Conference repeated at this conference. The French representative meant that the procedure of the Washington Conference, which focused on handling issues involving the three major naval powers first, was not good, so they would rather reuse the procedure of the London Conference and not encounter the compromise that the three major naval powers had already negotiated. Regarding the issue of qualitative restrictions, the French representative is willing to notify other countries of the detailed situation before each ship is built, so as to eliminate the element of sudden surprise. France regards this as one of the main causes of the arms race. It is rumored that French Navy Chief Pitti is now coming to London, but people in French circles here have no knowledge of it. (Reuters dispatch, 13th)</p>
<h3>First Committee's Previous Meeting; U.S. Representative Raises Three Reasons; Refutes Japan's Equal Demand</h3>
<p>(London) The situation of today's meeting of the First Committee of the Naval Conference is as follows:</p>
<p>The British representative raised a question regarding Japan's demand for equal rights, namely, whether this demand is purely a matter of principle, or whether Japan really wants to expand its navy to be equal to the navies of Britain and the United States. Any method that allows the Japanese navy to actually enjoy equal rights with the British Empire or the United States is absolutely unacceptable to Britain. The U.S. representative then spoke (see separate telegram) and also expressed opposition to Japan's proposal. The French representative said that his country has no direct relationship with Japan's demand for naval equality, but if the "common maximum limit" is implemented, then all countries can build warships to compete with Britain and the United States, so it is not convenient to support it. Moreover, this maximum limit can give Germany an excuse to demand a modification of the Anglo-German Naval Agreement (the Anglo-German Naval Agreement was signed on June 18 this year, stipulating that the tonnage of the German navy should be 35% of that of the British). The French representative then pointed out that there is no difference between the "common maximum limit" and the original proportional system, or even saving the proportional system. In short, the only way for the Naval Conference to avoid failure is to discuss the issue of qualitative restrictions. The representatives of Canada, Australia, and South Africa then spoke, expressing their support for the objections raised by the United States, and explaining the various needs of the British Empire, asking the countries participating in the meeting to pay attention to them, and saying that the claim for "numerical equality" is of no value. At this point, Japanese representative General Nagano stood up and said that the "common maximum limit" is still necessary, and said that Japan is prepared to reduce this common limit below the country's existing tonnage. After the common limit is realized, certain special circumstances in geography and military strategy may also be taken into account, but he did not fully explain how to take them into account. The Italian representative believed that the geographical situations of various countries are different, and the "common maximum limit" is not practically feasible. Finally, the Japanese representative concluded the discussion, saying that the various points made by the representatives of various countries will be carefully considered and answers will be provided when the committee meets tomorrow morning. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) According to our correspondent, the U.S. representative raised three major arguments at this morning's meeting of the First Committee of the Naval Conference to refute Japan's claim for a "common maximum limit": (1) If the naval tonnage of Britain and the United States must be reduced to the level of the Japanese navy in order to achieve equal rights, Britain has firmly opposed it, so if the so-called common maximum limit is to be implemented, the level of the Japanese navy must be raised, which runs counter to the principle of limiting and reducing navies advocated by the United States; (2) The "common categories" under consideration can completely overturn the balance stipulated in the Washington Naval Treaty. This balance is what the United States considers to be the main factor in maintaining stability in the Far East and the Pacific; (3) The proposal put forward by Japan does not take into account the special circumstances and responsibilities of various countries in geography and military strategy. As for the "responsibilities" of the United States, they should not be confused with the "vulnerability" of Japan. (Havas dispatch, 12th)</p>
<h3>U.S. Naval Officials Hold Secret Meeting at White House</h3>

<h3>US Treasury Secretary Announces Silver Purchasing Status: No Longer Exclusively Buying from London</h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today criticized the silver market speculation and stated that the U.S. would continue to implement the Silver Purchase Act. This act stipulates that the government can purchase silver from domestic and foreign sources at any time, regardless of price or conditions, if it deems it reasonable and beneficial to the public interest. However, we are now purchasing silver from various parts of the world and no longer focusing solely on London. This week, we have made several purchases from foreign countries daily. However, Morgenthau declined to specify the locations of these purchases. Experts speculate that the purchases must have been made in several places, likely Mount Isa, India, Mexico, or China. Morgenthau further stated that he could not discuss the reasons why the U.S. Treasury Department failed to maintain the London market. Since December 1933, the Treasury Department has purchased a total of 761,774,000 ounces of silver, and since June 19, 1934, it has purchased 591,800,000 ounces. The Treasury Department has purchased a total of 56,943,000 ounces of newly mined silver. With the nationalization of silver, another 113,031,000 ounces will be obtained. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau today denied reports that the U.S. has ceased silver purchases, stating that the U.S. has been purchasing silver daily at many different locations this week, but no longer exclusively in London as before. As for where silver was purchased this week, the U.S. Treasury Secretary declined to specify and neither confirmed nor denied direct transactions with China. The U.S. Treasury Secretary stated that the Silver Purchase Act stipulates that the Treasury Secretary may purchase silver under conditions he deems appropriate and most beneficial to the public interest, and this provision should be given special attention. Morgenthau's implication seemed to be that the current silver market situation is driven by price issues. When asked if there was any consideration to lower the price of silver, Morgenthau remained silent, only stating that his promise to silver-supporting congressmen to implement the Silver Purchase Act is still valid. Morgenthau acknowledged that the decision to no longer purchase silver exclusively in London lends greater weight to the speculation that the Treasury Department's silver purchasing operations are shifting to New York. Morgenthau estimated that the Treasury Department purchased approximately twice as much silver in New York yesterday as it did in London. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) Although the continued U.S. purchase of silver has somewhat calmed the silver market, the London silver market's hope of maintaining the normal and timely quotation of spot silver prices has not been realized. The spot price closed at 26 7/8 pence, down 625 from yesterday. It is reported that the amount of selling has slightly decreased compared to yesterday, while U.S. purchases have increased compared to yesterday. Therefore, the amount of forced selling by sellers was 18%, compared to only 7.5% yesterday. The U.S. Treasury Department today changed its previous practice and wants brokers to report individually the amount of sales they have been entrusted with. U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's statement that the U.S. has not ceased silver purchases has invigorated the silver market and created a good impression. It is generally believed that the U.S. is clearly prepared to continue purchasing silver in principle, and the international silver market is expected to stabilize. Some say that the U.S. will likely change its silver purchasing policy, adopting the method used for the Exchange Equalization Account, and not buy in one market to avoid public knowledge. This move can be considered wise. Furthermore, the reduction in the number of forward deliveries can also ease the silver market. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>(London) The London silver market is gradually becoming calmer, and there are still many spot sellers, though fewer than in the past few days. After the U.S. changed its policy, London lacks the appearance of possible large-scale purchases today. Most sell orders are limit orders. The more intense competition among silver markets will eventually erupt, which has long been anticipated by the general public. London does not find this strange, knowing that although London has recently held the dominant position in the silver market, its profit is quite thin and cannot last forever. (Reuters, 13th)</p>
<p>(New York) Financial experts here stated today that if the U.S. Treasury Department lowers the purchase price, it can purchase silver at a cost of 40 or 30 cents per ounce. Thomas, President of the American International Trade Association, stated that the association recently requested the repeal of the Silver Purchase Act and the abandonment of the government's monetary experiment. He cited the report of the American Far East Economic Survey Group led by Forbes, stating that the Silver Purchase Act failed to achieve our hopes, but instead caused suffering to China and shook U.S. trade relations with the Far East. (National Telegram, 12th)</p>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau's statement that the U.S. has shifted its silver purchasing operations from London to the world market has further increased the belief among financial experts here that this measure has national motives. However, there are conflicting opinions on whether the purpose of this move is to avoid purchasing Chinese silver exported by private dealers, or to break the power of speculators in the London market. According to the Treasury Secretary's published silver purchase statistics, the amount of silver purchased from abroad is more than generally imagined. Senator Thomas, leader of the inflation faction, therefore stated that if the Treasury Secretary could publish the details of silver purchases from time to time, this crisis would not have occurred. Thomas also expressed his support for the Treasury Department to purchase silver from the world market, but expressed disappointment at the continued decline in silver prices in London and New York.

<h3>Egypt Restores Constitution: Britain Expresses No Objection, Unity of All Parties is Irresistible</h3>
<p>Cairo After the cabinet decided to restore the 1923 Constitution, the Egyptian King signed and announced the decree of restoration today. Before the decree was issued, British High Commissioner to Egypt Lampson informed Egyptian Prime Minister Nessim that the British government has no objection to the restoration of the 1923 Constitution. The United Party, organized by leaders of all parties except the extremist Nationalist Party, today sent a letter to the British High Commissioner to Egypt, accepting the treaty concluded in London in 1930 but previously rejected. The letter announced that if Britain is sincere about the treaty, the United Party is willing to postpone the implementation date of the treaty until after the current international crisis has passed. The cabinet's decision to restore the 1923 Constitution is based on the unity of all parties, which is irresistible. (Reuters, 12th)</p>
<p>Cairo After the Egyptian cabinet decided yesterday to restore the 1923 Constitution, which was approved by the King, the second step regarding the reaffirmation of Anglo-Egyptian relations will be taken by Britain. The British government will soon explain its policy. Well-informed observers claim that Britain may recognize the situation after the Nationalist Party and the Liberal Party form a mixed government after the restoration of the constitution, but will likely try to postpone treaty negotiations.

<h3>Reuters Special Commercial Telegram, December 13th</h3>
<p>Gold and Silver</p>
<p>London Gold Price: Today decreased by one penny, to 141 shillings, one penny.</p>
<p>London Silver Market: The atmosphere today is not as pessimistic as in the past few days. Merchants seem to be gradually calming down to adapt to this new situation. The amount of selling has decreased, and there are more limit orders.</p>
<p>Mount Isa Silver: Today, sellers are asking for higher prices at the opening, because U.S. Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated yesterday that the U.S. government will continue to purchase silver. The decline in the London silver market is mostly due to the U.S. no longer purchasing silver exclusively in London. At the opening, buyers' bids did not change for the near term, but gradually increased for the long term.</p>
<p>Exchange Rates</p>
<p>British-American: Trading was very light in the London foreign exchange market this morning. The opening exchange rate for British pounds against U.S. dollars was $4.926875, down 0.0625 from yesterday's closing rate. Within the first hour, it rose 125 to $4.928125, with no further changes.</p>
<p>British-French: Opened up three pound sounds, increased by eight pound sounds in the first hour, remained unchanged at noon, dropped three pound sounds at one o'clock, and returned to three pound sounds at two o'clock to seventy-four francs fifty-four.</p>
<p>American-French: The gold currency exchange rate was slightly weak at the opening in the New York foreign exchange market today. French francs dropped 625 to six yuan six jiao one fen twenty-five.</p>
<p>Cotton and Wheat</p>
<p>New York Cotton Market: Today, due to good overseas telegrams and sympathy for the wheat market, the opening was quite strong, rising by about ten pound sounds. Prices continued to rise for three reasons: (1) the silver market has slightly turned around; (2) most of the long positions in the cotton market have been closed; (3) it is expected that the authorities are preparing other methods to control cotton production to prevent the Bankhead Act from being ruled illegal by the courts.</p>
<p>Chicago Wheat: Today, the Liverpool telegram was better, and the Argentine government has raised wheat prices, so the wheat market here opened strongly. The Argentine government's move recognizes that the recent world wheat price is not suitable for the statistical situation that wheat has greatly improved. Grain prices are strong along with wheat.</p>
<p>Liverpool Cotton: Today, due to the firmness of the wheat market and the slight relaxation of the silver market, prices are strong. At 1:00 PM, the January futures price was 6.29, up eight pound sounds.</p>
<p>Liverpool Wheat: This morning there was slight panic because the Argentine government raised the minimum price of wheat from 5.75 pesos to 10 pesos per 100 kilograms. Transactions for delivery at the wharf were completely disrupted, and the sale of wheat from Argentina and North America has now been completely withdrawn. The Australian and Canadian wheat markets are firm, and prices have risen sharply, but Australia sold cheaply; otherwise, the涨风that would have occurred would have been more than that. At 1:00 PM, the December futures price was 6 shillings, 2.75 pence, up 3.75 pence. The corn market is also volatile, with sellers asking for three pence higher.</p>
<p>Rubber</p>
<p>London: The market was stable this morning. The April 6th futures price opened unchanged at 6.4375 pence. No change at noon.</p>
<p>New York: The opening today was stable, with small price fluctuations and no major difference from yesterday's closing price.</p>
<p>Securities</p>
<p>New York: The market opened this morning and was still unsteady, but the atmosphere was more stable than before. Public utility stocks, railroad stocks, and automobile stocks all opened slightly lower, while industrial stocks were generally unchanged. Silver mining stocks opened slightly higher, and continued to advance at a rapid pace due to credit recovery. Copper stocks and steel stocks opened slightly lower but later rebounded. The firmness of the commodities market is one factor in the rise in securities prices. The average price of the Dow Jones 30 industrial stocks opened at 141.30, down four pound sounds. The New York securities market prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Students of Yucheng Middle School in Beiping Petition: Oppose All Puppet Organizations in North China; Guarantee the Integrity of National Territory and Administration</h3>
<p>Beiping Correspondence: The students of Beiping have always stood at the forefront of the people in successive national salvation movements. Recently, the situation in North China has become particularly tense due to the Japanese military's vigorous promotion of the so-called "North China Autonomy" movement. If North China is in danger, the whole country is in danger. If North China is safe, the whole country is safe. Therefore, if we want to maintain the integrity of China's territory and administration today, it depends on how the future development of the situation in North China unfolds.</p>
<p>Since the "September 18th" Incident [Mukden Incident], the students of Beiping, located on the first line of national defense, have been deeply stimulated by the national crisis. This time, they heard that a puppet organization will soon be established in North China, and the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction is truly a matter of concern at present. Even if the students want to study with peace of mind, they cannot. Therefore, the students of various public and private universities and middle schools in Beiping have spontaneously organized a student joint office and set off in full force on the morning of the 9th to petition He Yingqin at Xinhua Gate and Jurentang, opposing the general frustrated politicians who are raping public opinion and using public opinion as an excuse to implement the so-called "North China Autonomy", and opposing the organization of the so-called "Anti-Communist Committee" and all similar traitorous organizations. On that day, He Yingqin had already gone to Tangshan for bathing, so he was met by He's senior staff officer, Hou Cheng, who promised to convey it to He.</p>
<p>Before this petition by students from major middle schools in Beiping, the local political situation had already heard about it, so military and police were deployed in large numbers at important locations on the streets, and many students were arrested halfway when they set off from various schools in order to prevent the students from advancing. However, the students also implemented a full-scale charge in order to reach the predetermined meeting point at Xinhua Gate. The main points of the petition were seven: (1) Oppose secret diplomacy and publicize Sino-Japanese diplomacy; (2) Omitted; (3) Oppose territorial fragmentation; (4) Guarantee the people's freedom of speech, assembly, publication, and patriotic movements; (5) Immediately stop all civil wars; (6) Do not arbitrarily arrest the people; (7) Immediately release the arrested students. Qinghua and Yanjing Universities in Beiping, located more than 20 li outside the west city, in order to participate in the petition movement on that day (the 9th), set off at 6:00 in the morning. All male and female students ran more than 20 li in order to participate in the meeting on time. When they arrived outside the city gate of Beiping, all the city gates were locked and they could not enter the city. They had to send representatives to participate. The petitioning students from various schools, upon receiving this news, immediately reorganized and set off from Xinhua Gate and Jurentang, passing westward through Xidan Archway, and then northward, wanting to welcome Qinghua and Yanjing Universities students into the city. Along the way, they shouted slogans such as "Oppose North China Autonomy Under the Pretense of Public Opinion," "Preserve the Integrity of National Territory and Administration," "Long Live the Republic of China," etc. However, Xizhimen, Fuchengmen, Xibianmen, Guang'anmen, Dongbianmen, and Deshengmen had already tightly closed the city gates, and even the coffins that wanted to leave the city were stopped on the side of the road and could not go out. The petitioning students had to turn around and go north through Xisipailou to Huguo Temple to welcome the students of Fu Jen Catholic University. At this time, the participating students included more than 40 schools, including Northeast, Sino-French, Normal University, Pingda, Central University, Min Da, Peking University, Art College, Municipal Girls' Middle School, Wenquan, and Jingye, with about 8,000 people. Later, they turned from Fu Jen to Peking University, and then marched and demonstrated from Peking University. The front of the petitioning team had already reached the First District Office, and the end was still at the entrance of the Zhenguang Cinema, which shows the enthusiasm of the participating students. In this area, military and police were densely deployed, as if facing a formidable enemy, with about 500 people. The front row held leather whips and wooden boards, the middle row was equipped with tap water hoses, and the back row had guns with bayonets. When the leather whips and wooden boards were ineffective, they fired tap water hose fountains. The petitioning students then charged forward all at once. At that time, the tap water splashed like a machine gun, and the leather whips and wooden boards also danced wildly. The petitioning students were like chickens that had fallen into the water, and many were injured by the leather whips and wooden boards. Seventy or eighty people were arrested by the military and police along the way.</p>
<p>On that day, the north wind blew wildly, and it was extremely cold. However, all the petitioning students were extraordinarily energetic. After the dispersal, the representatives of each school immediately gathered at the Third Courtyard of Peking University to hold a meeting to discuss future action plans and decided to implement a strike from that day on. Therefore, all schools in Beiping have stopped classes since the 10th. The students of various schools were extremely indignant because the military and police actually suppressed the patriotic movement and arbitrarily arrested students and injured petitioning students. They are now planning to unite students from all over the country to expand the movement of "Opposing North China's Secession from the Central Government" and "Guaranteeing the Integrity of National Territory and Administration" in order to make persistent efforts and win the final victory. This petition movement of major middle schools in Beiping is unprecedented since the "May Fourth" Movement and is a "cardiotonic" for the people of the whole country, indicating that the current so-called "North China Autonomy" movement does not fundamentally have this kind of "suicide" demand among the Chinese people and is entirely created by the Japanese military.</p>
<h3>Wuhan Middle and High Schools Hold Joint Meeting</h3>
<p>Telegraphing the government not to cede rights or lose territory; encouraging Beiping students to coexist and perish with Beiping</p>

Tan Anqi, a representative from Huachung University, presided over the meeting and reported the purpose of the meeting, roughly saying, "The North China issue has become increasingly serious.

<h3>Hangzhou: Large Batch of Legal Tender Transported to Hangzhou for Use</h3>
<p>Since the implementation of the new currency system policy, the demand for one yuan legal tender in Hangzhou has suddenly increased because it must circulate in the market.

<h3>Taking a Plane in Thin Clothing Leads to Severe Asthma; "Efficacy Lungs Star" Cures Overnight</h3>
<p>Last week, Mr. Wang had urgent business in Hankou and traveled by plane. In his haste, he didn't add enough clothes, and caught a cold en route. Upon arriving in Hankou, he neglected his health due to pressing matters. After finishing his business, he returned by boat and car, further worsening his condition. His cough turned into severe asthma, preventing him from sleeping at night and causing immense pain. His neighbor, Mr. Li, had suffered from asthma for over a year and had sought effective remedies in vain. Coincidentally, Mr. Shi, a relative of Mr. Li, had just returned from England. Mr. Shi had long known about "Efficacy Lungs Star" tablets, a remedy specifically for severe asthma, as well as a highly effective medicine for tuberculosis, bronchitis, coughs, and various lung diseases. He recommended it to Mr. Li. Mr. Li hesitated at first, but Mr. Shi explained that the medicine was made from ephedra and other precious medicinal ingredients, with remarkably quick effects. Mr. Li tried it as suggested and indeed, his asthma lessened significantly. It was said that one dose lightened the illness, and another dose eliminated it altogether. Mr. Li, being a close neighbor of Mr. Wang, knew that Mr. Wang's asthma was caused by catching a cold. He gave Mr. Wang some of his remaining "Efficacy Lungs Star" tablets. After taking them, Mr. Wang's asthma disappeared as if by magic. He was overjoyed and grateful for Mr. Li's generosity. People from all walks of life suffering from asthma and other similar symptoms should quickly purchase British "Efficacy Lungs Star" tablets. Detailed instructions can be obtained by writing to Xinhua Company, 367 Jiangxi Road, Shanghai. (8)</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Department of Finance and Shanghai Banks Agree on Loan for Guiding the Huai River; RMB 4.4 Million to be Disbursed Soon</h3>
<p>The Da Gong News Agency reported that the Jiangsu Provincial Department of Finance, in order to carry out the project of guiding the Huai River, used a total of RMB 6.5 million of disaster relief bonds abolished by the Central Government and Jiangsu Province's construction bonds to borrow RMB 4.4 million in cash from the Central Bank, the Bank of China, the Bank of Communications, the Bank of Jiangsu, and the Jiangsu Farmers Bank in this city. Zhao Dihua, the Director of the Jiangsu Department of Finance, came to Shanghai to negotiate with the responsible representatives of the Bank of Communications in this city several times and formulated a draft agreement.

<h3>Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway: Completion of the Nanchang-Yushan Section</h3>
<p>Planning to Raise 18 Million for the Pingxiang Section; Contracts Signed with Shanghai Banking Groups and German Material Factories</p>
<p>The Yushan-Nanchang section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, 300 kilometers long, began construction last year after a loan was established with Shanghai banking groups and a material contract was signed with the German Otto Wolff factory. The construction of the entire section is largely completed. The opening ceremony was originally scheduled for New Year's Day, but the construction of a Guixi bridge near Nanchang was affected by strong winds and could not be completed as scheduled. Construction is now being carried out actively, and if it cannot be completed as scheduled, it may be postponed for a few days. All locomotives and passenger and freight cars were ordered from the Otto Wolff factory. In addition to some that have been shipped to China and put into use, there are still three locomotives and six passenger and freight cars that have been shipped from Germany and are expected to be shipped to China within the year. However, these passenger and freight cars are all chassis, and the upper passenger seats and canopies will be added after they are shipped to China. This move can save material prices and transportation costs on the one hand, and make as much use of domestic materials as possible on the other.</p>
<p>Planning to Build Nanchang-Pingxiang</p>
<p>The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway is divided into three sections: (1) The Hangzhou-Yushan section was completed and opened to traffic in 1933, (2) The Yushan-Nanchang section has now been completed and is scheduled to open to traffic on New Year's Day, (3) The Nanchang-Pingxiang section, which is 290 kilometers long, runs from Nanchang through Fengcheng, Qingjiang, Xinyu, Fenyi, Yichun, and then through Pingxiang to Liling as its terminus. The Railway Department of the Ministry of Railways and the governments of the two provinces have already sent personnel to survey the route. All materials and funds are equal to those of the Yushan-Pingxiang section. After consultation between the Ministry of Railways and the two provincial governments, it has been decided to continue issuing the second phase of RMB 30 million of railway construction bonds. Following the method of the Nanchang-Yushan section, RMB 15 million will be mortgaged to Shanghai banking groups for RMB 10 million in cash, and another RMB 15 million will be mortgaged to German material factories for RMB 10 million in materials (including road sleepers, rails, and vehicles, etc.). The total amount is RMB 20 million, but the budgeted expenditure only requires RMB 18 million, so this loan can be adjusted according to the situation. The loan contract has been negotiated and signed. The construction will continue to be handled by the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Bureau to make use of their expertise. If time permits, the groundbreaking ceremony will be held on the same day as the opening ceremony of the Nanchang-Yushan section.</p>
<p>Hangzhou-Jiande Track Replacement</p>
<p>In order to save expenses, the rails used in the Hangzhou-Jiande section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway were all 35-pound light rails, which can only run 15-ton vehicles. 35-ton and 40-ton vehicles cannot run. Therefore, the newly completed Nanchang-Yushan section and the planned Nanchang-Pingxiang section all use 63-pound heavy rails. In order to ensure uniformity and convenience, it has been decided to gradually replace the light rails on the Hangzhou-Jiande line with heavy rails. In the future, after the entire Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line is completed and opened to traffic, it will connect Shanghai-Hangzhou in the north and Fujian-Guangdong-Hubei in the south. It will have a great impact on the transportation and economy of the southeast. It is also reported that the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway Company will be reorganized into the China Railway Company to expand its organization in order to actively build railways in various provinces.</p>

The police of each branch bureau will be responsible for cleaning up opium smokers in their respective jurisdictions in the urban area. The water patrol team will be responsible for cleaning up opium smokers among boat dwellers on the water surface. From the beginning date to the end of the month, the general inspection period will be about half a month. The branch bureaus and water patrol team police are strictly ordered to investigate and crack down without perfunctory or procrastination. Opium smokers within the jurisdiction must be cleaned up, and secret opium dens must be cracked down and banned. The full success of cleaning up the city's opium atmosphere should be achieved. Those who are negligent will be severely punished. The anti-smoking campaign in this city will be carried out vigorously from now on. After the prohibition order is issued, it should be very effective. It is reported that the Public Security Bureau has also been working very hard in its investigations recently, and has cracked many opium cases and arrested many people. Opium smokers who surrender themselves are still very active. After the general inspection begins, it is expected that there will be even better results. However, opium smokers are still allowed to surrender themselves during the general inspection period in order to show leniency.</p>

Since Huiping went missing, the company ordered Litong to search for its whereabouts when it went to sea. Litong departed from Yantai yesterday morning (the 13th) and searched the Haizhou area. As a result, it was found. It is reported that after Huiping departed from Naimaishan, it encountered a strong wind. Because the ship was small and heavily loaded, it was feared that there would be danger. It sailed to a strait outside Haizhou called Longxudao Bay and entered to temporarily shelter from the wind, waiting for the weather to clear before sailing again. Because there was no radio telegraph on board, it could not send a telegram, which led to the interruption of news for days. The outside world suspected that it was missing, but fortunately the hull was not damaged. Litong immediately telegraphed both the Yantai and Shanghai companies to avoid concern. However, the wind and waves on the sea surface outside Longxudao Island are still large, and Huiping cannot sail out. It is waiting for good weather to return to Yantai. Because there are no passengers on board, the food supply can still meet the needs of the crew. The company has notified the China Ship Insurance Federation for verification yesterday afternoon.</p>

<h3>Buddhist Study Abroad Group Departs for Siam Yesterday</h3>
<p>A Group of Four, Including Biguan, Will First Go to Hong Kong and Then to Bangkok, with Plans to Stay in Siam for Five Years</p>
<p>Central News Agency reports: The Chinese Buddhist Siam Study Abroad Group, consisting of four people, including Biguan, Jingjiao, Dengci, and Jueyuan (originally planned for ten), led by Biguan, departed for Hong Kong on the Taikoo Company's Qiongzhou ship at 1:00 PM yesterday. Many Buddhists and Huang Jingwan and others went to see them off. According to the group leader Biguan, after they arrive in Hong Kong, they will go to Guangdong to visit Xiao Fucheng, a member of the Central Committee, to discuss matters related to studying in Siam. They will stay for about a week and then return to Hong Kong to take a ship to Bangkok, the capital of Siam, to meet the Buddhist Emperor and then determine the study program. They plan to stay in Siam for five years, spending four years studying Pali and the rules of the Bhikkhu, and one year traveling around to visit sacred sites. Their purpose is, firstly, to study original Buddhism on the ground, and secondly, to spread the sound of Chinese Mahayana Buddhism to that country, so that the Buddhist cultures of China and Siam can be communicated. The cost of this trip is about one thousand yuan, which is purely sponsored by people from both the government and the public. Biguan is 34 years old, Jingjiao is 35, Jueyuan is 27, and Dengci is 32. They are capable of enduring the arduous study life in Siam. The group's farewell letter to all circles is recorded below:</p>
<p>To all Buddhist elders and great virtues, virtuous knowledge, great lay practitioners, and gentlemen who love Buddhism throughout the country:</p>
<p>We have jointly initiated and organized a study abroad group to Siam, in order to meet the needs of the current Buddhist environment and the trend of the times in China. We are determined to sacrifice five years of our time to go to Siam to study original Buddhism on the ground - to practice the Bhikkhu's life of begging for alms, and at the same time spread the beautiful sound of Mahayana Buddhism from our country to that country, so that the Buddhist cultures of China and Siam can be exchanged and communicated with each other, and to promote the progress of Buddhist friendship between the two countries, and to embrace the hope and mission of human equality, fraternity, and world harmony. We are saying goodbye to the great virtues and loving elders of Buddhism in the country.</p>
<p>Since we initiated this idea and made this aspiration, we have received unanimous enthusiastic sympathy and support from elders, hermits, great virtues, and Dharma-protecting lay practitioners throughout the country, either giving us various guidance, or giving us full spiritual and material achievements, and we have also received praise from public opinion leaders. The group has achieved today's success - it has been able to make the trip, for which we are extremely grateful. We will always remember the noble kindness and profound impression given to us by all parties today, and we should always diligently encourage ourselves to strive for the Buddhism we are studying, to strive for the cause we hope for, and to do our best to realize it, in order to live up to the loving kindness and earnest encouragement of all parties today, and to fulfill our grand sentiments and aspirations.</p>
<p>In these dozens of days, we have asked various Buddhist elders, great virtues, Dharma-protecting lay practitioners, and leaders from all walks of life about their views. We believe that Chinese Buddhism, under the current trend of the times, does have the hope of reforming all the bad habits and bad systems cultivated in the previous imperial system environment, and that it is necessary to build a new life suitable for the current Chinese environment, and to develop the true spirit of "inner cultivation and outer practice" of Buddhist disciples to establish a complete "humanistic Buddhism" from human to Bodhisattva to Buddha, to eliminate the past idea of ​​"self-realization" for individuals, and to absorb new Buddhist people who serve the people, to promote the Buddha's humanistic Buddhism among all Chinese people, so that politics, academia, commerce, art, industry, and agriculture, all integrate into the good customs of "ten virtues" and "five precepts", cultivate the Chinese nation into a country with ten virtuous cultural customs, and expand to the entire human world to become a ten virtuous cultural human world. Our trip to Siam to seek Dharma also has the above-mentioned motives and aspirations.</p>
<p>We privately hope to actively seek advanced knowledge to enrich our inner cultivation, and return to our country after completing our studies to be a loyal envoy for the new cause of Buddhism - the new Buddhist cause of a human pure land. We are saying goodbye to the elders and loving gentlemen of all walks of life in the country, and we are going to the path we seek knowledge - the Buddhist country of Siam. At this time of parting, we sincerely ask our mentors and our loving friends in the country not to forget the Bhikkhu monks who have gone to a foreign country to study Buddhism. During our study period, we hope that you will be kind and generous, and often guide us, encourage us, and urge us on. In this way, the studies we seek can be completed and bear fruit. We are extremely hopeful. We write a few words to say goodbye.</p>
<p>Since we arrived in Shanghai, we would like to thank the China Buddhist Association, the China Buddhist Studies Association, the Shanghai Special Municipality Branch, the Bodhi Society, the Shanghai Buddhist Association, the Buddhist Pure Land Society, all organizations, the Haichao Temple, the Fazang Temple, the Jade Buddha Temple, the elders of various mountains, the great lay practitioners, the various newspapers, and the gentlemen of the various news agencies for their warm welcome and hospitality. We are extremely grateful for your kindness. Due to time constraints, we were unable to bid farewell and thank you one by one. Please forgive us.</p>
<p>The Head of the Chinese Buddhist Siam Study Abroad Group, Shishi Biguan; Members Shishi Dengci, Shishi Xingjiao, Shishi Jueyuan; Together, we respectfully bow. 24·12·11, at the Shanghai Buddhist Studies Association.</p>

<h3>Patriotic Movement of Students in Beiping; Students in This City Respond</h3>
<p>Since the patriotic movement of students in Beiping, student groups and cultural institutions in various places have responded one after another. In this city, all the students of the Mongolian-Tibetan Special School and all the students of Fudan University have sent telegrams, which were recorded in yesterday's newspaper. Now, we have compiled the telegrams from various parties as follows:</p>
<p>Tongji University Medical and Engineering Society sent a fast mail telegram yesterday, respectfully informing all circles, and telegramming Minister He and the Beiping Student Federation. The original text is as follows: Fast Mail Telegram, all newspapers and news agencies, to all circles of the country for your assessment. This time, the movement in Beiping has been subjected to oppression. We must unite to help them and resolutely oppose this violence and all organizations that undermine the integrity of the country. We demand that the Beiping authorities immediately release the arrested students. (1) Telegram to Minister He, Minister He of the Beiping Executive Yuan, near-term patriotic movement, please order the release of arrested students to appease public opinion. (1) Telegram to the Ping Student Federation, the Beiping Student Federation to all students for your assessment, you have launched this great movement, your attitude truly represents the will of the youth of the whole country, we swear to complete this work of saving the country with our blood and strength.</p>
<p>The Student Union of Daxia University sent a telegram yesterday opposing the autonomy of North China. The original telegram is as follows: (1) All agencies, newspapers, and school groups in the country are informed, Yin Rugeng is insane, claiming autonomy, acting as an accomplice of the tiger, and accelerating the demise of the country. The news came and we were furious. All students of our school will not hesitate to make any sacrifices, and dare to ask the government to quickly declare a crusade and hope that all circles of the country will unanimously support us and be our backing. We cannot pray enough, the Student Union of Daxia University kowtows, Yuan. (2) To all middle school students in Beiping, the country is in great trouble, and its survival is imminent. You do not hesitate to sacrifice and rise up together to make a parade to save the country, to show the sacred patriotism. Our association represents all the students of our school to express our absolute sympathy. In addition to our concerns, we hereby send a telegram to express our condolences and hope that we will fight to the end and win the final victory. We cannot pray enough, the Student Union of Daxia University kowtows, Yuan.</p>
<p>All the students of Datong University sent a fast mail telegram yesterday saying that the National Government, all departments, all agencies, all schools, and all newspapers are informed that our country is an independent and complete country, and its territory and sovereignty are absolutely complete, and no forces are allowed to infringe on it, and no attempts to separate it in any way are allowed. The so-called "autonomy movement" is originally the verbal propaganda of a few wanderers. We deeply hope that it is not true, but the Luan Dong Incident was planned in advance, and the situation in North China is brewing and organizing behind. Rape public opinion, subvert the country, and be insane to such an extent. The above two points have become a reality, and it is not too late to suppress the rebellion and quell the chaos. We deeply hope that the central authorities will immediately take decisive measures against this incident, which is enough to endanger the last lifeline of the country, and must not be perfunctory and compromise, create names, and lightly start the disaster of national subjugation and racial extinction. The final struggle, without any consideration, there will be no complete eggs under the overturned nest. May the people of the country rise up together to plan it. All students of Shanghai Datong University respectfully start, December 13, 24th year of the Republic of China.</p>
<p>The Nian'er (January 28th) Movement Promotion Association sent a telegram yesterday saying that all newspapers should forward it to all compatriots of the country. The situation in North China is becoming increasingly urgent, and the strong neighbors are watching and the clowns are jumping. Anyone with blood will be heartbroken. Our association's aim is to "promote local goods, practice social thrift, strive for social production, develop the national economy, improve the people's lives, and work together for the revival of the Chinese nation". We dare not fall behind in the work of saving the country. Seeing this adverse situation, we are even more worried. We vow to make the greatest efforts and follow the compatriots of the whole country to be the backing of the government and the vanguard of the nation. We hereby send a telegram to inform you. Shanghai Nian'er Movement Promotion Association.</p>
<h3>Reasons for the Trend of Falling Rice Prices; Rice Industry Bans Private Sales of Silver Coins</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: Recently, rice prices have been trending downwards. The reporter inquired with the rice industry and learned that this phenomenon occurs every year, but last month, due to the announcement of the new currency management law, some speculators manipulated it, and the price once soared to about ten yuan. However, recently, after the authorities have made great efforts to ensure the safety of the financial market, people's hearts have been greatly stabilized, and since the new grain has been on the market, the number of shipments coming to Shanghai from various sources has been very crowded, so the price has been trending downwards day by day. However, in recent years, the rural economy has been sluggish, and in general, farmers are eager to sell for cash after the autumn harvest, so although the harvests in various places are not very good, the spot market is very strong, all due to the fact that farmers have no ability to hoard. The reporter also asked about the Ministry of Finance's order to the rice industry to ban private sales of silver coins. According to reports, since the Ministry of Finance issued the new currency management law, hard currency has no longer been used. As for the matter of privately hoarding for profit, it should be strictly prohibited. As for how to handle it, a meeting will be convened for thorough discussion, and a decision will be submitted for approval before proceeding accordingly.</p>
<h3>The Inspection Group to Siam Will Depart Next Spring</h3>
<p>Central News Agency reports: In order to connect the relations between China and Siam and to understand the situation of overseas Chinese in that area, the Chinese government organized a semi-official inspection group, intending to go to Siam for inspection, and appointed Lin Kanghou as the head of the group. It was originally scheduled to depart as soon as possible, but it has been postponed again and again due to some incidents. According to the reporter's inquiry from relevant parties, the group decided to postpone the departure until next spring because the end of the year is approaching and some of the members have a lot of private affairs and it is impossible to make the trip within the year. As for the rumors that Siam has recently oppressed overseas Chinese, the official has not received any reports.</p>
<h3>This Newspaper Received Flood Relief Donations Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday (the 13th), the seven halls of this newspaper received flood relief donations, including fifteen yuan raised by Mr. Wu Fengming from Deki, and one yuan from Mr. Huang Chunlin, for a total of sixteen yuan.</p>
<p>Saving the victims is like saving lives. Donate one more penny and save one more life.</p>
<h3>An Anonymous Person Enthusiastically Helps the Relief Efforts</h3>
<p>The China Foreign Relief and Disaster Relief Headquarters Recruitment Unit at No. 505 Henan Road, Shanghai, has received flood relief for the northern part of the Pineapple Province. It is heard that after the association received it, it immediately issued a receipt stamped with the seal of the Ministry of Interior, and remitted it to the disaster area in northern Jiangsu for distribution. Such enthusiasm for disaster relief, and not seeking fame, is truly a virtuous gentleman, enough to influence the world.</p>
<h3>The Salt Affairs Office Held a Meeting with Salt Merchants Yesterday to Discuss the Establishment of a Huai Salt Ever-Normal Granary</h3>
<p>The Industrial News Agency reports that in order to prevent salt shortages and regulate salt taxes, the Salt Affairs Inspection Office of the Ministry of Finance has specially planned to establish a Huai Salt Ever-Normal Association to regulate the people's food. The methods for setting up warehouses and transportation have been announced and implemented. Later, due to the different opinions of the merchants in various ports, in order to implement the plan, they specially invited representatives of the Huai Salt merchants to Shanghai for detailed discussions. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM, the newly appointed Salt Transport Envoy of Lianghuai, Yao Junyu, hosted them at the Salt Affairs Office. More than 20 representatives from various places attended.

It is also learned that Xiang Jinwen, a representative of the people from various counties in Anhui and Henan, came to Shanghai the day before yesterday and appealed to the Salt Affairs Office to take over the vacancy of the Le Lun sales to stabilize salt prices. The salt administration affairs will have to wait until the newly appointed Salt Transport Envoy of Lianghuai, Yao Junyu, takes office in Guanyun within a few days before they can be reviewed and handled.</p>

<h3>The County Government Intensifies Winter Defense</h3>
<p>The Shanghai County Government is now intensifying its efforts to prevent local bandits during the winter defense period. Therefore, it is strictly enforcing the joint guarantee and joint liability system, and implementing punishments in accordance with the regulations. Yesterday, it ordered the district offices to issue notices to the township and village chiefs to strictly check and squeeze out unruly people, so as to avoid joint liability. As for the sentinel stations in each district that have been organized, they should be organized and reported by a deadline. If they are not established again, the township and village chiefs of each township should be punished.</p>
<h3>The French Concession is Conducting a Survey of Taxpaying Chinese; It is Expected That 6,000 to 7,000 Households Will Qualify</h3>
<p>The Taxpaying Chinese Association of the French Concession originally scheduled a joint meeting of the executive and supervisory committee members on the 15th of this month. However, due to the busy schedules of the members, it has been rescheduled to 2:00 PM on the 16th.

<h3>The Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition of the Flood Relief Association Opened at the People's Education Center on the 27th of This Month</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Relief Association for Flood Victims in Various Provinces, in view of the fact that the disaster victims are all over the fields and the disaster areas are vast, and the disaster victims are waiting for relief urgently, especially since the severe winter has already arrived, and they are suffering from both cold and hunger, this relief is even more in demand. Therefore, recently, various fundraising methods have been held in the afternoon to provide relief. Fortunately, it has been warmly praised and generously donated by all walks of life, and the results are very impressive. The details of the fundraising have been published in various newspapers. It is now learned that Mr. Li Dachao, the director of the fundraising team of the association, and Mr. Wang Lanjun, the founder of the Xiangzu Calligraphy and Painting Society, which travels around the country, plan to hold a calligraphy and painting exhibition for three days during the annual vacation. In recent days, they have been preparing everything. The exhibition location has been decided to be held at the People's Education Center on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi, and it is scheduled to open on the 27th of this month. The exhibition period is currently agreed to be three days, but if necessary, the exhibition period may be extended. Because the Xiangzu Society is a calligraphy and painting group that travels around the country, it has been around for a long time, and all the works of calligraphy and painting masters from various provinces have been collected, and it is rich in the meaning of national revival, so this calligraphy and painting exhibition has a special purpose. Mr. Wang Lanjun, the founder of the society, in view of the severe disaster this year, and the responsibility of relief, dared not fall behind. He donated more than 500 pieces of various famous paintings he had collected to the Flood Relief Association, which was hosted by the Flood Relief Association, and the money from the sale was generously used for relief funds. Mr. Wang's enthusiasm for relief is admirable. It is hoped that all sectors of society will actively participate and jointly provide relief in order to help the disaster victims.</p>
<h3>The Jisheng Society is Handling Winter Relief in Tianmen, Hubei</h3>
<p>The Chinese Jisheng Society, together with the China Foreign Relief Association, is handling winter relief in Tianmen County, Hubei Province. The association is now sending 1,500 sets of cotton clothes and remitting 7,000 yuan for relief through the Siming Bank. However, according to letters from comrades handling relief, Ji Guozhen, Hou Yongde, Qian Xinru, and others, the disaster victims in the county have been displaced and homeless since the disaster, and the miserable situation of being exposed to the wind is so terrible that even a heart of iron and stone would be moved to tears. However, the association is limited by its finances, and knows that a mere spoonful of water is far from enough to cope with this huge number of disaster victims. Unfortunately, the market is depressed, and everything that can be scraped together has been exhausted. At this time of biting cold wind and burning hunger, the sound of mourning is everywhere, and people's livelihoods are on the verge of extinction. We, living in peace in Jiangsu and Zhejiang, have been blessed by Heaven. It is hoped that everyone can start from diligence, thrift, and hard work, and save money to save these disaster-stricken compatriots and rescue the dried-up fish. There is no shortage of enthusiastic philanthropists in Shanghai who, seeing this tragic disaster, will surely be moved.</p>
<h3>The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce Decided to Return the Settlement Case of the Guobi Company</h3>
<p>The liquidator of the Shanghai Guobi Company, because the company's assets were obviously unable to pay off its debts, had requested the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce to settle the matter in accordance with the law, and the Chamber of Commerce had resolved to accept it. However, because the procedures for requesting settlement have not been completed so far, it has been impossible to handle it. It was decided yesterday to return it. A letter was sent to the First Special District Local Court and reported to the Bureau of Social Affairs for record. The letter said, "In response to the matter, on the 12th of this month, we received Training Order No. 11153 from your bureau, stating that, according to the request of the representatives of the employees of the Shanghai Guobi Company, we were ordered to report the details of the conciliation of the case in detail for review. We hereby report that this case was filed on October 11, according to Article 40 of the Bankruptcy Law, when the company's liquidator applied for settlement, stating that it could only be accepted if no one had filed a petition for bankruptcy or settlement with the court at the same time. We asked them to check and reply first. On October 14, the company's liquidator stated that there were no such circumstances, and we replied on October 17 that we accepted it in accordance with the law, and asked them to send the various documents stipulated in Article 7 of the Bankruptcy Law to the association by October 31 for handling. At the same time, Ke Changwei Ganchen was appointed and accountant Xu Yongzuo was hired to be responsible for auditing the books and handling the settlement. On November 1, the company's liquidator sent the various documents to the association, and we replied that all advertisements for convening a meeting of creditors, as well as borrowing seats, etc., required expenses, and a deposit of 500 yuan should be paid first for registration. However, the company's liquidation was not paid until the 25th, and the deadline was still not followed, so we urged again and extended the deadline to December 5. Later, it was changed to extend the deadline to December 6. However, the company's liquidator stated that the settlement plan still needed to be revised, and requested an extension twice on December 4 and December 7, but the payment was still not made. According to Article 42 of the Bankruptcy Law, the Chamber of Commerce should convene a meeting of creditors as soon as possible after receiving the request for settlement, but no later than two months from the date of receiving the request for settlement. The date on which the association received the company's liquidator's request for settlement was October 11. As of yesterday, the statutory period for convening has expired. Even if it is calculated from October 17, the date on which it was accepted in accordance with the law, the deadline will soon expire, and the company's settlement plan is still being revised. In this case, the convening of creditors is even more uncertain. According to the provisions of Article 42 of the Bankruptcy Law, the deadline is no later than two months, and there are no provisions for discretionary extensions. Such repeated delays make it impossible to handle the settlement. The 72nd regular meeting of the Xichang has resolved to return the case. We hereby submit a document for review and approval.</p>
<h3>The Municipal Council Band Will Hold a Concert Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Tomorrow (Sunday) at 5:15 PM, the Municipal Council Band will hold its tenth Sunday concert at the Lyceum Theatre, which is also the fifth popular concert of this newspaper. However, the program of this concert will completely adopt the masterpieces of the great French writer Saint-Saëns. Saint-Saëns was born on January 9, 1835, and died on December 9, 1921, so this year is also the centenary of Saint-Saëns. Various countries are holding Saint-Saëns centenary concerts this winter, and Shanghai's move also shows that Shanghai people attach importance to music and are no later than others. In addition, on December 22 at 3:00 PM, the Lyceum Theatre in this city will have a special concert celebrating Christmas. This concert will be jointly hosted by the Municipal Council Band and the Shanghai Choral Society. The overall leader is Mr. Dexter, the honorary director of the Choral Society.

<h3>YMCA Lecture Today: American Attitude in World War II</h3>
<p>The crisis-ridden year of 1936 is almost upon us, and the fuses for World War II are also laid everywhere, waiting for the tolling of the war bell before they explode. The lines of fire in Europe and Asia have already been lit. What role will the newly rising Americanist Americas play in this war? Not only are we concerned, but it is probably also the focus of international attention.

<h3>Public Concession: Park Tickets Changed to Silver Dollar Calculation</h3>
<p>Tickets for the parks in the Public Concession have always been calculated in small silver dollars and copper coins. Because the exchange rate between large and small silver dollars varies, starting from January 1 of next year, all tickets will be calculated in silver dollars at 20 cents. Furthermore, according to the Park Management Office's November report, the weather in November this year was unusually warm. The chrysanthemums and large lotuses in Zhaofeng Garden were in full bloom all day, which was quite beautiful, and there were many visitors. Mr. Dinggell also donated an Australian kangaroo to the zoo, which is already being raised in the park. The sports fields in other parks were also heavily used. However, the bowling green in the Hongkou Park Cemetery was officially closed on the 11th of this month. According to statistics, the total number of visitors to the parks and children's gardens this month reached more than 245,000.</p>
<h3>Yi Hua Film Company Hosted Banquet for Various Sectors Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yi Hua Film Company was founded by Mr. Yan Chuntang, with a total investment of nearly 700,000 yuan. Therefore, the films previously produced completely emphasized ideology. Although they were appreciated by the intellectual class, the business side failed to achieve satisfactory results, and there were many twists and turns in personnel. The outside world did not know the truth, and was almost misled by rumors of closure. However, Mr. Yan's efforts in film were still unwavering. He recently hired Mr. Wu Bangfan and Mr. Ren Jinping to join the sponsorship. Yesterday, they hosted a banquet at the Atlantic Hotel for the press and business circles to describe the experience. Halfway through the meal, Mr. Ren gave a speech on behalf of the company, saying that today China's industry and commerce are under the pressure of a downturn and have fallen into a state of needing rescue. The film industry is no exception. This time, I joined Yi Hua to assist. At first, I estimated that my ability was weak and did not dare to agree quickly. More than ten years ago, I and Zheng Zhengqiu and Jue Zhugu enthusiastically promoted the film industry and co-founded the Mingxing Film Company with Mr. Zhang Shichuan and Mr. Zhou Jianyun. Now Zhengqiu and Zhugu have passed away, and Mingxing is also in the turbulent tide of the film industry. I have become an outdated figure in the film industry, and it has been eight years. I did not want to mislead others with my failure. After two months of consultation, I temporarily agreed to go to the company for one hour a day to inspect and then discuss the plan. The plan is not a theory or an article, but must first study the facts, investigate the environment, and estimate the company's own ability before a plan can be made. This is what is called "reorganization." Now, after more than a month of investigation, I feel that the company's own ability is quite strong, and the colleagues who are currently staying in the company have some spirit, so the future of the business may not be pessimistic. For example, the company currently has two soundproof photography studios, and the open space for setting up scenery is about fifteen or sixteen acres, which, according to the current phenomenon of making movies, can only be used for making ten plays at the same time. Now the company is only making two plays, so there is still surplus capacity to make eight more plays, which can be used for self-reliance. I have now written a report based on this observation, which will be used as a basis for self-reliance and joint efforts. Please give us your guidance at any time. The friends from the industry and commerce sectors, seeing that the film "Heroes of the Times" contains the consciousness of appealing to industry and commerce and can fulfill the mission of propaganda in the film industry, have given their strong support in the spirit of helping each other in the same boat, for which we are especially grateful. Then, Mr. Cai Diaotu was invited by the guests to give a speech in response, encouraging both Yi Hua and Mr. Ren. Finally, Mr. Yan Chuntang raised his glass to thank everyone. After the banquet, he invited the guests to the Jincheng Grand Theater to watch "Heroes of the Times." When they arrived at the theater, a notice of "Sold Out" was posted, and the theater had already been arranged.</p>
<h3>Da Hu Bank: Returning Savings Deposits Below 1,000 Yuan, First Paying 20% in Cash, with Subsequent Payments Later</h3>
<p>Since closing down, the Da Hu Bank in Shanghai has been rectifying its internal affairs to seek reorganization and actively collecting outstanding debts to repay depositors as soon as possible. All kinds of demand deposits of the bank were repaid last month. From the 16th of this month, the bank will continue to repay fixed savings deposits below 1,000 yuan. However, due to the weakness of the city, the receivable relief funds, and a request to the bank to extend the term and provide assistance to the poor, the bank has to adopt a method of repayment in installments for depositors. It is reported that it has been decided to first repay 20% of the fixed-term savings deposits below 1,000 yuan in cash, and the remaining 80% will be notified for subsequent payments after the relief bills mature and accumulate to a certain amount. This method will be announced by the bank in the newspaper in the next few days. It is also reported that the amount of relief funds released by the bank is still more than 400,000 yuan, while the total amount of deposits in this regard is only more than 100,000 yuan. The assets are several times more than the liabilities, so depositors should not suffer losses if given a little more time.</p>
<h3>Caojiadu Detective Team: Continuing to Catch a Suspected Thief</h3>
<p>Zhuang Dexiu, the captain of the detective team of the Caojiadu Public Security Bureau, together with detectives, arrested the robber Lu Xicheng, also known as Fukang, aged 32, a native of Hai Liu, near Datong University on Zhongshan Bridge, who was plotting to rob, and seized a Brown Lin pistol and seven bullets. After being taken to the bureau, he continued to arrest a suspect, Zhang Jinsheng, aged 36, a native of Pudong, a tailor, at Wujiaochang last night, and sent him to the bureau for interrogation.</p>

<h3>Letter from the Chinese Taxpayers' Association to the Public Works Department: Correcting the Illegal Behavior of the Vehicle Committee, Forcefully Stating the Evils of the Current Method, and Explaining the Association's Intention to Stop Disputes</h3>
<p>The Chinese Taxpayers' Association of the Public Concession sent a letter to the Public Works Department yesterday, saying:</p>
<p>"To the Director,</p>
<p>According to a letter from the Shanghai Municipal Rickshaw Trade Association, 'Since the spring of last year, the Vehicle Committee of the Public Works Department proposed a reduction in rent, and after a long debate by rickshaw owners, the Public Works Department finally convened a meeting of rickshaw owner representatives and the Vehicle Committee on August 6 of the same year to discuss the matter on an equal footing. As a result of the discussion, it was agreed that the rickshaw rent, together with the mutual aid fee for rickshaw pullers, would be 85 cents per day. Later, because the rickshaw pullers did not have silver dollars to pay the rent, both parties re-negotiated to change the rent to 12 cents in small silver dollars. The facts are all there and can still be reviewed. In November of this year, when the new currency system was implemented in our country, the Vehicle Committee published a notice on the 9th of the same month, and also sent a letter to the branch office of our association in the special district, both stating that the rickshaw rent collected in the future should not exceed 85 cents in silver dollars. If it is in small silver dollars, each shift can only collect 5 copper coins, and two shifts a day should only collect 10 cents in small silver dollars and 6 copper coins in total.' Our office immediately forwarded the letter to the rickshaw owners and instructed them to inform the renters to comply. Unexpectedly, the letters had only been sent for two days, and the word had not yet spread. The Vehicle Committee, based on the rickshaw pullers' incomplete and untrue reports, considered that the rickshaw owners were overcharging the rent, abused their power, and deducted licenses and fines. This happened several times a day. For example, a fine of 10 yuan is required for one vehicle, 100 yuan for ten vehicles, and so on. If the fine is not paid, the license will be confiscated for one month, and there are many misunderstandings in the punishment. Let me briefly explain it. The rickshaw shifts are divided into morning and evening, but the time regulations of the rickshaw companies are different. If the morning and evening shifts are equal in time, the rent will naturally be average. If the morning shift is short and the evening shift is long, the rent will naturally be different. This time, the misunderstanding occurred because the morning shift collected 4.6 cents in small silver dollars and the evening shift collected 6 cents in small silver dollars. The Vehicle Committee only listened to the evening shift rickshaw pullers and did not investigate the morning shift rent, and immediately accused them of overcharging. This is one reason. In addition, the Vehicle Committee allowed the rickshaw owners or renters to collect the rickshaw pullers' loans, arrears of rent, and housing fees, as evidenced by the exchange of documents on November 30 last year. This time, most of the rickshaw owners or renters caused dissatisfaction among the rickshaw pullers due to the collection of the above items. They reported in general, and the Vehicle Committee did not distinguish and verify, and immediately concluded that they were overcharging the rickshaw rent. This is another reason. Even after the rickshaw owners explained and debated repeatedly, the Vehicle Committee ignored them. If there is an application for review, once a second summons is issued, whether it is true or not, the punishment will be doubled. Also, if they fail to arrive during the summons period due to an event, once they arrive, they will also be doubled punished (for example, if the original fine is 10 yuan, it will be 100 yuan. If the rickshaw owner has the above two situations, they will have to be fined 200 yuan). Not only is the punishment undue, but it is also added on top of the punishment. The Chinese and Western members of the committee sit high and command respect, and there is almost no room for dissent, which is shocking to hear. The rickshaw owners are oppressed and devastated by this, and they complain and are indignant. It seems that tears will follow their voices. Our office has previously sent a letter to the Vehicle Committee, asking it to carefully review and handle the matter. After that, the rickshaw owners will correct their mistakes if they have any, and encourage themselves if they have none. The committee replied that it would still act willfully and would not adopt it. On December 2, it convened a general meeting of all rickshaw owners in the special district and publicly elected five representatives, including Gu Zhiling and Hou Shaoan, to negotiate. As a result, the committee said that the decision on whether to implement the punishment case would be made by the board of directors on the 10th of this month. The representatives thought that there was a trend of change. Who knew that since then, the rickshaw owners who were summoned and punished have become more and more numerous, which is even more shocking. I think that the rickshaw owners in the special district all have ears and eyes. In this wave of successive fines, how dare they greedily overcharge a little rent and risk losing a large amount of fines or having their licenses confiscated for a month? Even if the rickshaw owners are foolish, they would not be so foolish. Looking at the reasons, the usual grudges between the rickshaw pullers and the renters are inevitable. Now, because the Vehicle Committee is suppressing the rickshaw owners, listening to the rickshaw pullers one-sidedly, and summoning and punishing them regardless of the truth, the rickshaw pullers dare to take this opportunity to retaliate. This is why it is becoming more and more common. (According to the investigation, there are already 77 rickshaw owners who have been fined and had their licenses confiscated, totaling 219 vehicles. A separate form is attached.) If this continues, the impact will be great, and disputes will be more numerous. It is almost certain that the public rickshaw industry will be on the verge of bankruptcy. We have always known that your council is the only legal organization for Chinese taxpayers, seeking the welfare of citizens and supporting all industries. Therefore, we are submitting this report to you and beg you to examine the previous situation and forward it to the Public Works Department, asking it to stop the Vehicle Committee from abusing its power and exempt all fines and license confiscations so that the rickshaw owners will not suffer endless losses and can stop the expansion of disputes. Our industry will be fortunate, and society will be fortunate.'</p>
<p>After reviewing the case, we have found that disputes have arisen frequently since the establishment of the Rickshaw Affairs Committee, which has caused our association great pain. Now, our association should ask your bureau to pay attention to the following two points: (1) The establishment of the Vehicle Committee increases the burden on taxpayers and forces the establishment of a mutual aid association. In name, it seeks the welfare of rickshaw pullers, but in practice, the mutual aid association has become a hotbed of trouble, and the Vehicle Committee has become a slaughterhouse for rickshaw owners. The rickshaws rented by rickshaw owners are divided into two shifts, with unequal lengths of time. This is like carving a mark on a boat to find a sword. It only makes one-sided reports and leaves no room for defense. If this is true, it will cause class struggle. If the rickshaw owners are devastated in this way, public rickshaws will naturally disappear. In the current situation in China, how will rickshaw pullers make a living? Some say that this policy is to increase passengers for foreign public vehicles, which is not an exaggeration. (2) The Vehicle Committee fines rickshaw owners for overcharging the rickshaw rent, but according to our association's investigation, it actually fines them in fact but donates them in name. We do not know according to what law. Has it been recognized or approved by our officials? If it is a fine, it must be judged by the appropriate court. If it is a donation, there is a legal basis for the housing tax (i.e., the municipal general donation). If taxpayers refuse to pay without reason, they must also be prosecuted according to law. However, the Vehicle Committee confiscates licenses and extorts donations. Although it is a fair and quasi-autonomous organization, its behavior is no different from the criminal act of using coercive means to force people to hand over their property, which should be punished with criminal prosecution. We hereby request your bureau to promptly correct this illegal behavior and dissolve the Vehicle Committee to stop disputes. Society will be fortunate."</p>
<h3>Pudong: A Big Fire in Jiangxinsha</h3>
<p>The entire town of hundreds of homes was reduced to ashes.</p>
<p>Jiangxinsha, Pudong, across the river from Zhanghuabang, Wusong, has always been a small town. Since Guanghua Oil Pool, Texaco, Asia, and other companies successively established oil pools there, the market has been quite prosperous. Recently, municipal ferries have also docked there, and various shops and residents from other places have gradually increased. There are about 300 homes in the entire town. However, most of the houses there are simple in construction, and most of them are still thatched huts. At 11:30 PM the night before last, a fire suddenly broke out in the home of Cai, a resident there, and immediately penetrated the roof. Because the wind was very strong at that time, it immediately spread to the neighboring houses. Also, because the thatched huts were easy to catch fire, it spread throughout the town in an instant. The fire-fighting equipment there was also lacking, so it was impossible to put it out. It was not extinguished until yesterday morning. However, hundreds of shops and households in the entire town had been reduced to ashes. One person was burned to death afterwards, and the tragic situation was indescribable. The loss is temporarily impossible to estimate. It is reported that the arsonist has been captured by the Public Security Bureau and is being investigated.</p>
<h3>Huangdu Road Police Repel Bandits: Railway Bureau Police Department Commends and Encourages, Awarding 50 Yuan in Legal Tender</h3>
<p>On the 20th of last month, Zhao Xuemin, a railway guard at the Zhenru Station of the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, encountered bandits plotting to rob him near Huangbo. The police and bandits opened fire at each other. As a result, Officer Zhao was shot twice, but fortunately, the injuries were light and his life was not in danger. It is now reported that the police departments of the two railways, considering that Officer Zhao was not negligent in the face of the incident, bravely protected the railway, and was able to restrain the bandits and protect the public firearms after being shot, showing both wisdom and courage, which is admirable, in addition to instructing their subordinates to strictly pursue the fleeing bandits and pay attention to prevention at all times, they specially allocated 50 yuan in legal tender yesterday and handed it over to the officer to show their commendation.</p>
<h3>Renting the People's New Village: Registration Begins the Day After Tomorrow</h3>
<p>Tenants can contact the office directly. Formal Move-in January 1 of Next Spring</p>
<p>Xinsheng News Agency reports that the four people's new villages built by the Municipal Government for the benefit of the people, located on Qimei Road, Damuqiao, Pushan Road, and Zhongshan Road, have now been completed. Only some internal decoration and scattered projects remain, which should be completed step by step before the middle of this month. The training class of the People's Welfare Enterprise Management Committee will officially end today and will be assigned to serve in various villages tomorrow. Therefore, each village can start tenant registration the day after tomorrow (16th). Those who want to rent can contact the staff of the village office directly. After the registration procedures are completed, each village can formally move in on January 1 of next spring. However, tenants must abide by the residential rules of the people's village stipulated by the association when moving in, otherwise they will be rejected. The association has also formulated detailed management rules for the convenience of managing the residents. After each household in the people's village moves in, they will be managed by the supervisor in accordance with the rules. The detailed management rules mainly stipulate that each household should pay attention to public health and public fire prevention, etc. It is reported that the equipment of each people's village is divided into several types, including bedrooms, kitchens, laundry rooms, sports fields, and public people's schools.</p>
<h3>Wife Grieved by Husband's Tragic Death Also Commits Suicide: Making the Old Maid Shed Tears</h3>
<p>Zhang Zhongwen, a local, aged 29, worked as a waiter in a junk factory and lived with his wife, Wang, from Pinghu, aged 21, at No. 252 Lian'an Lane, Tiantong Road. They had a son who was only two years old. Zhang was fond of women and later had an affair with Mao Zhang, a woman from Ningbo. On the morning of the 7th of this month, the couple, for some unknown reason, went to Mengyuan Hotel at No. 227 Hubei Road and opened room No. 230, where they swallowed a bottle of Lysol. Zhang died because he took too much, and medical treatment was ineffective. The Laozha Police Station reported it to the First Special Court Procuratorate, which appointed a prosecutor to verify that it was true and ordered the family to collect the body. Mao Zhang is still being treated. This was reported in the previous newspapers. However, Zhang's wife, Wang, was so grieved after her husband's death that she washed her face with tears all day, sighed, and often revealed her desire to follow her husband to the underworld. Although her relatives and friends tried to persuade her in every possible way, it was difficult to relieve her desire to die. Unexpectedly, at about 7:00 AM the day before yesterday, she took advantage of the fact that her aunt, Zhang Huang, had gone out to buy firewood, and secretly swallowed a bottle of Lysol that she had prepared and left home. When her aunt returned home and saw that her daughter-in-law was not there, she knew that something had happened and rushed out to look for her. She found her collapsed on the south bank of the Zhapu Road Bridge, having been poisoned. She immediately reported to the guard post, Chinese policeman No. 1954, and summoned an ambulance to the scene to fly her to Renji Hospital. Unfortunately, it was too late, and she died at 1:50 PM that afternoon. The Chief Patrol Station sent detective Tian Changyuan to investigate. The body was taken to the Feitou Road autopsy room for examination. Yesterday morning, Tang, a prosecutor appointed by the First Special Court, arrived at the autopsy room. After verifying the body, he first reported the previous situation according to Chinese police chief Xue Ziwen, and then according to the aunt of the deceased, Zhang Huang, aged 55, "The deceased resented the fact that my son died, and I saw that she was like this, and I was afraid that something unexpected would happen, so I often comforted her and invited relatives and friends to persuade her. Yesterday morning, I saw that she did not have a worried look, so I did not suspect anything else. I went out to buy firewood, but unexpectedly, she also took poison," she said, with tears streaming down her face, as if there was endless sorrow. Tang took the statement and verified that the deceased, Zhang Wang, was a woman who died from poisoning from taking Lysol. The body was handed over to her aunt, Zhang Huang, to collect and put in a coffin.</p>
<h3>Car Collides with Tram: Seven-Year-Old Child Crushed to Death</h3>
<p>At about 7:25 PM last night, a boy, Qian Axiao, from Taicang, only seven years old, living at No. 306 nearby, was on the south bank of the Wuzhen Road Bridge on Xinzha Road, when a truck, No. 16855, was traveling from west to east. The driver saw the child in front and, fearing an accident, quickly moved the engine to the side to avoid it. Unexpectedly, at that time, a tram of Route 3 was speeding towards him and collided with each other. The child Qian was caught in the middle and was crushed to death immediately. The car was also badly damaged. Fortunately, the driver and passengers were not injured. Chinese policeman No. 698 rushed to the scene after hearing the alarm and copied the number of the vehicle that caused the accident. Then, the body was loaded and sent to Baojiang Hospital and then to the autopsy room for examination.</p>
<h3>Chinese Road: Bandits Rob Three Houses in a Row: Traces of Theft from the Huode Lending House</h3>
<p>At about 7:00 PM the night before last, six bandits broke into the Dade Lending House on South China Road, claiming to be inviting friends. Two bandits showed pistols to scare and prohibit anyone from making a sound, and drove the people inside to a corner. They then began to search, taking 183 silver coins, one gold ring, several silver watches, two fur robes, and one coat. After robbing, they stepped onto the second floor of the main hall and robbed 25 silver coins and a suitcase from a neighbor's house, and then entered the Zheng family's room and robbed a platinum watch, glasses, and other items. After looting to their satisfaction, the bandits carried the stolen goods out of the door and disappeared without a trace. Afterwards, the person in charge of the lending house reported it to the police station, requesting an investigation.</p>
<h3>Casual Talk Leads to Murder</h3>
<p>How did Li Zhou die after all? Ni San, the monk, and others deny committing the crime.</p>
<p>Li Zhou (also known as Zhou Xiaomei), wife of Li Laosan, a Suzhou native who lived by ferrying at the Fen Shan Pier in Pudong, was chatting with a neighbor, Lu Xiaomao, around 12:00 noon on November 2nd. Their conversation touched upon the ambiguous relationship between Shen Baogen's wife and the monk Ni San. Ni San happened to overhear this and questioned Li Zhou, leading to heated arguments and insults. Subsequently, Ni San gathered Zhang Liu, the monk, Pan Amao, and others, who injured Li Laosan and kicked Li Zhou in the lower abdomen. Unfortunately, she was pregnant. Despite medical treatment, she died on the evening of the 21st of the same month. Li Laosan filed a complaint with the local court's prosecutor's office, which sent personnel to verify the coffin sealing. Meanwhile, the Public Security Bureau arrested the suspected criminals, monk Ni San, monk Zhang Liu, Pan Amao, etc., one after another, and sent them to the court. Prosecutor Dian Binzhang conducted a thorough investigation and filed a public prosecution under Article 277, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law. At 3:30 PM yesterday, Judge Lu Hongyi held a court hearing. The plaintiff, Li Laosan, testified about the previous events and requested legal action. The judge ordered the incarcerated Ni San and others to be brought to court. Ni Er, the monk, testified that he was 27 years old and made a living by ferrying. He said that around 9:00 AM on November 2nd, he was drinking at a hotel and had an argument with monk Zhang Liu over money, which led to grappling. He denied hitting Li Zhou. Furthermore, Shen Xiaoyang, a fellow worker on Li Laosan's boat, said that Li Zhou fell and was injured at the Da Lai Pier in Pudong, leading to her death. Her husband, Li Laosan, falsely accused him of gathering a crowd and kicking her to death. Zhang Liu, the monk, testified that he was 27 years old and from Suzhou. His testimony largely coincided with that of Ni San. Finally, Pan Amao testified that he was 30 years old, from Chongming, and ran a hotel in Lujiazui, Pudong. He did not know Ni San or Li Laosan and had no dealings with them. He said he didn't know about their fight and that the Public Security Bureau arrested him, accusing him of assault, which was a false accusation. After hearing the testimonies, the judge announced that the case required further investigation and would be adjourned for further hearings. The defendants were returned to custody.</p>
<h3>Verdict on the Antique Vase Case: Jiang Yuting Sentenced to Eight Months with a Two-Year Reprieve</h3>
<p>Jiang Yuting, the owner of Yuan Zhang Jewelry Shop at 99 Shanxi Road and a native of Wuxi, was recently sued in the Special First Court by Chi Yunfei from Fujian for fraudulently obtaining an antique Guyuexuan vase worth a fortune. The Special First Court has completed its investigation and hearings, the details of which have been thoroughly reported in this newspaper. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Ye Shengchao announced the verdict in the Fifth Criminal Court: Jiang Yuting, with the intent to illegally possess property, used fraudulent means to induce another to deliver property, and is sentenced to eight months of imprisonment with a two-year reprieve. The plaintiff is to provide a security deposit of 20,000 yuan before being allowed to retrieve the stolen vase.</p>
<h3>Arrest of Robbers, Crackdown on Drug Manufacturing Operation, One Chinese, One Japanese, and One Korean Arrested</h3>
<p>Nan Xianghu, a Korean resident of Room 101, Apartment 6, Lane 297, Peng Road, Hongkou, was suddenly robbed by two young robbers on the 10th. As a result, he was robbed of 5,200 Japanese yen and 500 Chinese yuan. The robbers escaped with the loot at the time, and the victim requested the police to pursue the case, the details of which were also reported in this newspaper. Unexpectedly, while the police were investigating, they received a tip-off around 12:00 noon yesterday, claiming that the robbers in the case were currently hiding in House 8, Lane 163, Xiaoshadu Road, in the jurisdiction of the Gordon Road Police Station, requesting immediate arrest. Therefore, the police immediately dispatched a large number of detectives to the address to arrest the suspects. Unexpectedly, upon entering the house, they only saw three men staying there, one Japanese, one Korean, and one Chinese, who did not resemble the suspects. However, when the detectives questioned them, they hesitated and seemed to have something on their minds. When asked about their occupation, they only said they were chemists. Seeing that their behavior was suspicious, the detectives ordered them to lead the way to inspect the rooms. Unexpectedly, upon taking a look, they discovered something unexpected. The upper floor was a huge drug manufacturing operation. The rooms were filled with drug manufacturing machinery, several barrels of morphine raw materials, and countless spare parts. As a result, the three men immediately surrendered and were taken to the police station. All the drugs and machinery spare parts were also transported to the police station by police vehicles for temporary storage, pending transfer to the court for legal proceedings this morning. The Japanese and Korean individuals will be sent to the Japanese Consulate for questioning.</p>

<h3>Liu Huizhi, Accused of Embezzlement, Closing Arguments Concluded, Sentence Scheduled</h3>
<p>Liu Huizhi, the former General Manager of the China Industrial Bank, was suddenly sued for embezzlement by Zhang Zhongfu, a shareholder of the bank, after resigning from the position. Zhang discovered that Liu Huizhi had engaged in various fraudulent activities during his tenure. He hired lawyer Chen Ying to file a lawsuit in the First Special District Court, accusing Liu Huizhi of embezzlement. The indictment listed six counts of Liu's criminal behavior, with the total amount embezzled reaching over six or seven hundred thousand yuan. After the court approved the indictment, Judge Liu Yugui summoned Liu Huizhi for questioning. Several hearings and thorough investigations have been conducted. The case could have been concluded at the previous hearing, but due to time constraints, the two sides did not have time to present their arguments. Therefore, it was heard again in the Eighth Criminal Court yesterday. The defendant, Liu Huizhi, and his defense lawyer arrived on time. Judge Liu continued to preside over the hearing. First, Li Fengtang of Hengshun Trust Company was called as a witness. After his testimony was verified, the plaintiff, Zhang Zhongfu, was questioned again. Zhang stated that the defendant, Liu Huizhi, had used various fraudulent methods to establish accounts under false names during his tenure, profiting from them and embezzling a large sum of money. As a result, many shareholders suffered losses. Therefore, he requested the court to sentence the defendant according to the law. Regarding the private prosecution aspect, he stated that since the discovery of the defendant's embezzlement, the price of China Industrial Bank's stock had plummeted to 15% of its original value. Thus the plaintiff's shares of one thousand yuan were also affected, resulting in a loss of eight hundred and fifty yuan. Therefore, the defendant should be responsible for compensation. Subsequently, Judge Liu instructed the lawyers of both sides to begin their closing arguments. The two sides debated for a long time before concluding their arguments. The court then announced that the closing arguments were concluded and a sentence would be scheduled.</p>
<h3>China Leprosy Sanatorium New Facility to Open Today Health Department to Send Wu Liande to Participate</h3>
<p>The China Leprosy Sanatorium purchased over 80 mu of land in Dachang Temple and built hospital wards, all of which have been completed. The opening ceremony is scheduled for 2:00 PM today. According to Wu Zhijian, the general secretary of the association, the preparations for the sanatorium began before the January 28th Incident. The Hongkou Skin Hospital used to treat about 200 leprosy patients each year. Local hospitals, such as the Red Cross Society and Tongren Hospital, also treated such patients, but none had large-scale facilities. Statistics show that there are more than ten leprosy hospitals in the country, most of which are in Guangdong Province, with the Jinan Leprosy Hospital in Shandong being relatively well-equipped. According to known figures, there are four to five hundred new leprosy cases in China each year, but the actual number is definitely higher. According to the experience of the Indian medical community, the known number can be multiplied by ten. Therefore, extrapolating from this, there are at least two thousand patients in Shanghai. In the past, domestic treatment methods were passive. The purpose of establishing this sanatorium is to provide fundamental treatment with scientific methods and equipment, as the disease is not incurable. At the same time, a research association will be organized, with physicians from the National Medical College in charge, inviting representatives from all related sectors to join in medical research. The medical college, the Red Cross Society, and the existing sanatorium doctors will be responsible for medical matters. On the one hand, emphasis will be placed on experimental work. In terms of funding, the board of directors donated 60,000 yuan, Hu Wenhu donated 20,000 yuan, and Americans donated 10,000 yuan, totaling 90,000 yuan. In reality, 110,000 yuan has already been spent, and the remaining amount will be the responsibility of the board of directors. Currently, there are more than ten leprosy patients admitted to the sanatorium. Wu, the mayor of Shanghai, various bureau chiefs, and celebrities from all walks of life have been invited to the opening ceremony tomorrow (i.e., today), and the Health Department will send Wu Liande to participate.</p>
<h3>Hu Wenhu Donates Over Ten Thousand Yuan for Hygiene Experiment Institute Construction Funds, Eleven Thousand Yuan Has Been Remitted to Mayor Wu for Transfer</h3>
<p>Overseas Chinese compatriot Mr. Hu Wenhu returned to China from overseas last year and visited Shanghai to observe municipal construction.

His benevolent heart for the well-being of the people will be forever remembered in the great Shanghai, admired by all, both Chinese and foreign. It is now reported that Mr. Hu's donation of eleven thousand yuan has been remitted and handed over to Mayor Wu for transfer to cover the construction and equipment costs. It is also reported that Mayor Wu, in recognition of Mr. Hu's enthusiasm for public welfare and benefiting society, has not only sent a letter of thanks but also decided to erect a bronze statue of Mr. Hu in the institute to commemorate him. At the same time, he has also petitioned the central government to commend him.</p>

<h3>Local News: Construction of Buddhist Library</h3>
<p>Site selected at Jueyuan on Avenue Road, Initiated by Jingye Society, Named Fobao (Dharma Treasure)</p>
<p>Datong News Agency reports that the Buddhist Jingye Society at 418 Hardoon Road, Shanghai, noting the scarcity of Buddhist libraries in the country, which makes it difficult for researchers of Sanskrit texts to find references, has initiated the construction of a large-scale Buddhist library. The construction funds and site have been arranged. Datong News Agency reporter has specially investigated the situation as follows:</p>
<p>Site and Funding Secured</p>
<p>The Society has now selected a site within Jueyuan on Avenue Road, measuring over 30 feet wide and 70 feet long. Surrounded by lush flowers and trees, the scenery is serene and suitable for building a Buddhist library constructed entirely of steel and reinforced concrete. It will be named "Fobao" (Dharma Treasure). The construction funds have been exclusively donated by Ye Gongchao, amounting to 10,000 taels of silver, equivalent to about 14,000 legal currency yuan.</p>
<p>Song and Yuan Dynasty Paintings, Ming Dynasty Printed Sutras</p>
<p>In addition to the Society's existing collection of various scriptures, many renowned figures, including Di Chuqing, have recently donated numerous Song and Yuan Dynasty Buddhist images and paintings, as well as many ancient printed classics. Among them, the images of the three saints of Song Dynasty painting, the Manjusri image, the Ming Hongwu and Yongle Dynasties' imperial edition sutras (totaling over 900 volumes), and an ancient Tang Dynasty Sanskrit vase are particularly valuable. After the library is completed, they will all be displayed in the library.</p>
<h3>All-Zhejiang Association Cables Zhejiang Provincial Government Requesting Funds to Purchase Tobacco Seeds</h3>
<p>Annual Loss of Tens of Millions, Urgent Need for Improvement to Increase Profits</p>
<p>The All-Zhejiang Association in Shanghai sent a telegram to the Zhejiang Provincial Government stating: "To the esteemed Zhejiang Provincial Government, We have learned that the annual import of American tobacco to China is valued at tens of millions of yuan, resulting in a significant loss of wealth. In recent years, Xuchang in Henan and Jiaodong in Shandong have improved tobacco cultivation by adopting American golden seeds, which are favored by various cigarette factories. Production has increased year by year, and tobacco farmers have gained considerable profits. Our Zhejiang, such as Xinshang and Sheng in Shaoxing Prefecture, Chongtong in Jiaxing Prefecture, and Songyang County in Quzhou Prefecture, are all tobacco-producing areas. The total annual output of the province is no less than ten million yuan, which is also a kind of production. However, due to a lack of knowledge of improved cultivation and manufacturing, it is only used to produce local tobacco, which cannot compete with foreign goods. The goods are abandoned on the ground, which is a pity. At a time when rural areas are declining, we should find ways to improve agricultural production to help alleviate the situation. In addition to the association preparing funds to purchase American tobacco seeds for distribution to various tobacco-producing areas for trial planting to promote it, the matter is of great importance, and the association's capabilities are weak, making it difficult to achieve widespread results. We propose that the Construction Department be instructed to formulate measures for improving tobacco seed planting and roasting, allocate public funds to purchase large quantities of American seeds to subsidize roasting facilities, and encourage farmers to improve urgently in order to increase profits. This matter concerns production and construction and is very important. It was unanimously approved by the association's general meeting. We hereby submit this telegram, requesting your esteemed government to review, examine, and implement it. We are extremely grateful. Shanghai All-Zhejiang Association bows in respect."</p>

<h3>Sanbei Company Layoffs and Salary Cuts, Sailors Petition Party Headquarters for Relief, Various Seafarer Organizations Hold Meetings to Assist</h3>
<p>Xin Sheng News Agency reports that the Ship Owners' Association previously proposed an 80% salary cut due to the decline in the shipping industry. After negotiations by the Haichang Party Headquarters Seamen's Union and opposition from various seafarer organizations, the proposal was shelved. Recently, Sanbei Shipping Company laid off and cut salaries for the tally departments of various ships. The Jing'an, Xing Shi, Ming Xing, Qingpu, Songpu, Xinpu, and other ships have already implemented these measures. The tally clerks of the ships believe that the company's treatment has always been harsh and has recently become even more severe. Unable to bear the pressure, they sent representatives to petition the Seamen's Party Headquarters for relief. Director Hu Qi of the Labor Guidance Section met with them and promised to negotiate strongly with the company and instructed all workers to work peacefully and wait for a resolution before a solution is reached. The representatives were satisfied and returned to their ships to continue serving as usual. Yesterday, the Party Headquarters sent Zhang Donglin to conduct preliminary negotiations with the company. Various seafarer organizations believe that during this period of national crisis, labor and management should work together to overcome difficulties and have decided to jointly discuss countermeasures. It is said that a joint meeting of various organizations has been scheduled.</p>

<h3>South District Rent Reduction Association Receives Instructions from Chairman Chiang</h3>
<p>The Shanghai Nanshi District Rent Reduction Committee, considering that rents in Shanghai are high and citizens are unable to bear the burden, believes that unless political power is used, landlords will use the law to their advantage, and rent reduction disputes will escalate.

<h3>Tan Shiquan Sentenced to Seven Years in Prison for Selling Silver Dollars, Unsuccessful Smuggling of Silver Coins</h3>
<p>Tan Shiquan, a Guangdong native who worked as a chief steward on a certain foreign warship, was recently inspected by customs officers boarding the ship. The officers found 1,400 silver dollars in Tan's possession and reported it to the Water Police, who sent detectives to arrest Tan and send him to the local court's prosecutor's office for investigation and prosecution. The criminal court conducted several thorough investigations and hearings and awaited sentencing. Yesterday, Judge Wu Deying held a court hearing and ordered Tan Shiquan to be brought to court. After a brief interrogation, he rose to announce the sentence: Tan Shiquan, with the intention of profiting, unsuccessfully attempted to smuggle silver coins out of the country and is sentenced to seven years of imprisonment. The 1,400 silver dollars are confiscated.</p>
<h3>Buying Three Yuan of Silver Dollars Triggers the Law of Seven Years' Imprisonment, Pity the Poor Who Commit Serious Crimes for Small Profits</h3>
<p>A Chongming native named Chen Zhenming, who runs a cigarette and paper shop in Hongkou, sent his apprentice Zhu Jinxing to a small shop at 318 Xingjiaqiao Road in Zhabei to buy three yuan of silver dollars, agreeing to exchange them for paper money at a rate of 1.1 yuan per dollar. While the exchange was in progress, a patrolling police officer discovered it and took Zhu to the Public Security Bureau. Zhu confessed that he was ordered by the shop owner Chen Zhenming to go out and buy silver dollars for resale to foreigners, earning a profit of 20 to 30 cents per dollar. The bureau transferred Zhu to the local court's prosecutor's office, which prosecuted him for obstructing national currency. The criminal court held a hearing yesterday with Judge Lu presiding. Zhu and others hired lawyers to defend them and requested bail. The judge announced that the sentence could be as light as seven years in prison or as severe as the death penalty and denied bail. Therefore, he ordered them to be returned to custody for further instructions.</p>

<h3>Record of the General Meeting of the Southern Goods Industry Association</h3>
<p>The Southern Goods Industry Association held a temporary general meeting of members at Chongyi Hall the day before yesterday. A quorum of members was present. Yan Jingyan, Xu Bokang, and Cheng Dongping were elected as chairmen. After the customary ceremonies, the chairmen reported the purpose of the meeting, which was to address the tea and bamboo shoot industry's breach of the originally agreed contract this year, with the intention of monopolizing, an illegal act. The association had previously held meetings to discuss countermeasures, and all members had been notified. The discussion focused on the previous resolution of the association that members should temporarily suspend transactions with the Lusun industry until both parties agree on a solution, in order to encourage the other party to realize their error. Unexpectedly, the industry continued to act unilaterally, ignoring the association's concerns. In view of the association's vital interests and the need to uphold the legitimate rights of the industry, a fundamental and thorough solution should be determined. It was resolved that all members of the industry should, from today onwards, resolutely refrain from purchasing goods from the Lusun firms in the southern market, expressing a severance of relations. If transactions have already been completed but payment has not yet been made, the payment should be made according to the old rules. In the future, if any member is found to have engaged in private transactions, and the investigation confirms the fact, the goods in question will be confiscated by the association. Twenty percent of the proceeds will be given to the informant as a reward, and twenty percent will be used for investigation and transportation expenses for those handling the matter. All matters will be handled by the association in accordance with the resolution. The meeting adjourned after the discussions.</p>

<h3>Appeal in the North Henan Road Murder Case Luo Yusheng Hopes for a Reduced Sentence While the Police Request a Separate Penalty According to Law The Relationship Between Jin Dai's Deceased Husband and Luo's Father Still Needs to Be Investigated</h3>
<p>Luo Yusheng, a native of Yiwu, Zhejiang Province, and the director of general affairs at Mingchen Primary School, No. 31 Xinqiao Road, Nanshi, was found to have conspired with two fugitives at 8:15 AM on September 23 of this year, carrying two axes and breaking into No. 459 North Henan Road, where they killed Jin Dai (also known as Baozhen), a woman from Jinhua, and her maid, Luo Guo. They also stole property. Hua Tanchang Shangwu and Tanmu Zhao Qingkui of the Huishi Police Station apprehended Luo Yusheng and brought him to the First Special Court. After repeated interrogations, he was found guilty and sentenced to life imprisonment for joint murder and one year imprisonment for theft, to be served consecutively.</p>
<p>Life Imprisonment.</p>
<p>Deprivation of civil rights for life. The related civil suit was transferred to the Wu Court for trial. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. Now, it has been learned that both the police and the defendant Luo Yusheng have expressed dissatisfaction with the verdict and have separately filed appeals with the Second High Court. Yesterday afternoon, Yu Hua, the head of the Mountain Criminal Court, along with judges Jiang and Zhou, took the bench in the First Criminal Court for the hearing. Zheng Yue, the chief prosecutor, also attended the court to perform his duties. Judge Yu first questioned Luo Yusheng about the grounds for his appeal. Luo claimed that his father, Luo Zhaoxin, was killed last year in Qinghe Fang by Jin Dai, and that he</p>
<p>was avenging his father.</p>
<p>He argued that both the law and human sentiment should be considered and that he should be granted leniency. Subsequently, Zhang Tianyin, the lawyer representing the Public Works Department, rose to state the intent of the appeal, saying that Luo Yusheng's father, Luo Zhaoxin, had been practicing law in Ningbo, while Jin Dai's husband, Jin Zhaoluan, was a prosecutor at the Ningbo District Court. They were teacher and student and became close friends. After Jin Zhaoluan's death, he entrusted his family affairs to Luo's care, and their interactions were frequent, with no grievances between them. On June 19th last year, Luo was killed in Qinghe Fang, and Jin Dai</p>
<p>had absolutely nothing to do with it.</p>
<p>Later, the police received an anonymous letter reporting that Luo was killed by a certain Zhang, and the police went to arrest him, but Zhang had fled after hearing the news. Jin Dai entrusted lawyer He Qi to sell a diamond ring and used the 100 yuan obtained to offer a reward for the arrest of the murderer. It could be said that Jin Dai had shown Luo's family great kindness and righteousness. This time, the defendant Luo Yusheng repaid kindness with revenge, even colluding with others and carrying axes to kill her and rob her of the necklace she was wearing and the gold ring on her hand. It was clearly a case of robbery and murder. The initial trial found Luo guilty of theft</p>
<p>and murder</p>
<p>and sentenced him accordingly, which seems to be an error. The original verdict should be overturned, and he should be sentenced according to Article 332 of the Criminal Law for robbery and murder. Luo Yusheng reiterated that his father, Luo Zhaoxin, had been practicing law in Ningbo for more than ten years. After being seduced by Jin Dai, he left Ningbo and came to Shanghai to live with her. They initially rented a house on Baoshan Road in Zhabei. However, due to the January 28th Incident, all of their belongings were destroyed. They later moved to No. 459 North Henan Road and continued to live together. He even moved furniture from his old home in Ningbo to Shanghai and</p>
<p>forced my mother back to the countryside.</p>
<p>Last autumn, my father was killed near his law office in Qinghe Fang, and all of my father's property, such as the proceeds from the sale of the corn cake shop, 8,000 yuan from the sale of the house, shares in the Yongyu Yarn Factory, deposits in the Hangzhou Local Bank, etc., were all seized by Jin. The contents of the boxes were also empty. At that time, while I was negotiating with my mother to have Jin return the property, I suddenly received a threatening letter threatening me to leave Shanghai as soon as possible, otherwise I would be killed. The letter identified the person who killed my father as a certain Zhang who lived on Laoshenfu Road. I immediately sent the letter to the Lao Zha Police Station for investigation, but the location was</p>
<p>a Japanese residence.</p>
<p>Moreover, the handwriting on the letter seemed to be from Jin Dai. Therefore, my father's death was partly due to Jin's attempt to seize my father's property and partly due to other reasons. When the court asked what those reasons were, Luo said that he had no evidence and could not say it clearly, as it was related to the reputation of the Jin family. The police lawyer presented Jin Dai's handwriting, stating that it was completely different from the handwriting on the letter. Luo denied that the handwriting presented by the police lawyer was Jin's, saying that Jin used to work at the Commercial Press and that her handwriting could be investigated. Judge Yu reviewed the evidence and stated that further investigation was necessary in this case. He ordered Luo Yusheng to be returned to custody and scheduled another hearing.</p>
<h3>An Elderly Woman Who Assisted a Housewife in Abusing a Maid Was Arrested Midway</h3>
<p>The maid's food was also restricted, claiming that eating too much would make her stupid.</p>
<p>Qiu, the concubine of Fan Binghua, a compradore of the former Sanbei Shipping Company, lived at No. 6 Xinping Li, Longmen Road. She had been abusing her maids, Zhou Meiying and Shundi, causing them to suffer serious injuries. Shundi even died as a result of her injuries. Fan Qiu fled without a trace. Feng Baishun, a Chinese Tanchang of the Chengdu Road Police Station, and Tanmu Wang Shanqing, among others, had the corpse of Shundi taken to the autopsy room for examination by the Special First Court Procuratorate. All of this has been reported in this newspaper. It is now known that the maids Zhou Meiying (12 years old) and Shundi (10 years old) were both sold to Fan Qiu's family as maids last year. However, Qiu was inherently violent and cruel. Relying on her position as a housewife, she</p>
<p>abused her authority.</p>
<p>If anything displeased her, she would inflict all sorts of cruel and vicious tortures. The woman had a female servant named Zhu, also known as Zhu Xushi or Lao Meimei, a native of Suzhou, who had been working in Fan Qiu's household for thirteen years. She was deeply favored by her mistress and thus became a henchman, assisting in the abuse. Fan Qiu also authorized Zhu, making her the equivalent of a supervisor of the servants. Her methods were even more vicious than those of the mistress. As a result, the mistress and servant were extremely strict with the two maids. Not only were they not given enough to eat or warm enough clothes, but if their words were not heeded or their work was not good, they would be subjected to cruel torture. In addition to being</p>
<p>severely beaten with firewood sticks and shoe soles, they were also burned with cigarette butts, causing the two maids to be covered in scars and as thin as skeletons. On one occasion, Zhu even used scissors to cut off a section of Zhou Meiying's right little finger. When Shundi recently became seriously ill, Zhu even slammed her head against the door until she was terminally ill. Only then did she lock Shundi in an empty room and leave her to die. After the incident, the police made every effort to investigate Fan Qiu and Zhu. They went to Room 517 of the Eastern Hotel on Xizang Road to make arrests, but they had already</p>
<p>fled after hearing the news.</p>
<p>Later, Zhu was arrested at No. 130 Zhengjia Muqiao and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Eighth Criminal Court of the First Special Court and charged with intentional injury and intentional injury resulting in death under Articles 278, Clause 12, and 286, Clause 1 of the Criminal Law. The police lawyer, Zhang Tianyin, stated the above situation, saying that at 4:42 PM on the 11th of this month, the police received a phone report saying that someone was abusing a maid at No. 6 Xinping Li, Longmen Road. They ordered Tan to go and investigate. Initially, the people in the room all denied it, and since there was no evidence, they were about to return. However,</p>
<p>they received a confidential report</p>
<p>and conducted a more detailed investigation. They found the maid Shundi in a very serious condition, barely breathing, in the attic. They sent her to Guangren Hospital, but she died on the way. At this time, the defendant Zhu fled with Fan Qiu. They took another maid, Zhou Meiying, to the police station. According to Zhou, the mistress and the defendant treated her very badly, not allowing her to eat her fill and often beating her and burning her with cigarette butts. It has now been confirmed by Guangren Hospital that there are injuries to her head and scars from burns all over her arms.</p>
<p>As Thin as a Rail.</p>
<p>Judging from her condition, it seems that she was not given sufficient food on a regular basis, which led to this condition. In short, the defendant in this case and her mistress, Fan Qiu, used cruel torture and committed this inhumane act. It is truly rare. When questioned, the defendant Zhu confessed that Shundi was bought as a maid by her mistress last November for 96 yuan. Meiying was also bought last year. It was true that the mistress often beat and burned the two maids with cigarette butts. I was also ordered to control the two maids. Their food intake was indeed restricted, because eating too much would make them</p>
<p>stupid.</p>
<p>Meiying's right little finger was not cut off by me. It was because she had a boil that festered. In May of this year, Shundi suddenly developed lung disease. I took her to Renji Hall for treatment once. Later, because she was seriously ill and there was no cure, I sent her to an empty room on the order of the mistress. Before she died the other day, I did slam her head against the door once. Furthermore, Cui Hongsheng, the chauffeur of Fan Qiu's household, and Fang Chen, the nanny, testified to the abuse of the two maids. The maid Zhou Meiying also testified to being beaten and having her little finger cut off by the defendant. Judge Wu Zehan reviewed the evidence and ordered Zhu to be held in custody for another hearing on the 18th. Meiying was temporarily sent to the Jiliang Institute.</p>

<p>Children's Educational Novel</p>
<h3>Little Men (123)</h3>
<p>— Original by Louisa M. Alcott, Translated by Zheng Xiaocang</p>
<p>When they reached the great prairie, other lanterns, like will-o'-the-wisps, appeared here and there. Mr. Pei's voice could be heard calling, "Nanen, Robert, Robert, Nanen!" The servant, Lai Siwu, whistled and howled wildly. Tangen, riding a rabbit, darted east and west. The rabbit seemed to understand the situation, overcoming obstacles without difficulty. Mrs. Shu often asked everyone to be quiet, saying with a choked voice, "Loud noises might scare them. Let me call; Robert knows my voice." So, she called the dear little name with various gentle tones, until even the echoes seemed to gently respond, and the breeze seemed eager to carry it in all directions. However, there was still no reply.</p>
<p>By this time, the sky was covered with dark clouds, and the moon only peeked out occasionally. Heat lightning frequently flashed from the clouds, and distant rumbles of thunder seemed to foretell the arrival of a great storm.</p>
<p>"Oh, my Robert! My Robert!" the poor Mrs. Shu cried pitifully, wandering back and forth like a ghost with a desolate expression, while Tangen stayed by her side like a loyal firefly. "If Nanen comes to any harm, what can I say to her father? I don't know why I entrusted my precious child to someone traveling so far! Filizi, did you hear anything?" When she received the pitiful reply, "No," she wrung her hands, expressing an even greater sense of despair. Seeing this, Tangen jumped off the rabbit's back, tied the reins to a fence, and said with his resolute spirit...</p>
<p>"Maybe they went to the spring! I'll go look."</p>

<h3>Losing by a Single Point; Xiexing Loses to Jinan</h3>
<p>27 to 28</p>
<p>—John Five Two Beats Youyou Three Five—</p>
<p>There were only two Group A basketball games in the Western Youth League last night. The game between Jinan and Xiexing was particularly exciting and captivating. Since defeating McLing, Xiexing's team has been greatly boosted and has won repeatedly. Even in yesterday's game against Jinan, they were leading all the way. In the first half, they were ahead 19-8. In the second half, Jinan worked hard to catch up. In the last five seconds, Xiexing was winning 27-26. Unexpectedly, Wang Nanzhen made a long shot, and Jinan took the lead by one point with this ball. The gains and losses were truly a matter of luck. In another game, John played Youyou, ending with a score of 52-35, with Youyou losing.</p>

<p>(2) Jinan Beats Xiexing</p>
<p>After the game started, the two sides held each other for about three minutes without any score. Then, Wang Nanzhen went on a solo run and made a layup. Chen Zongqi of Xiexing was not to be outdone and scored four points with both hands. After that, Xiexing's momentum was strong. The forwards and backs were well-connected. In an instant, Zhang Jinxiang scored another two points from a free throw, taking a 6-2 lead. Jinan worked hard to narrow the gap. Han Zhenyuan and Wang Nanzhen added three points, creating a very close situation again. The two sides fought even more fiercely. All ten players were seen flying around the court. The tension in the air was indescribable. Xiexing employed all its forces. The forwards Xu Heng, Zhou Dayun, and Qiu Guangxie were particularly brave and fierce. Jinan tried its best to defend, making it impossible to counterattack. Under these circumstances, Xiexing took advantage of the situation and indeed soared to end the first half with a 19-8 lead, a truly golden age.</p>
<p>At the start of the second half, Jinan was even more careful. Han Zhenyuan gave a warning shot, scoring two points in a row. Zhang Jinxiang also lived up to his mission, scoring another two points for Xiexing. The situation was still good. However, unpredictable things happen. Jinan suddenly launched an all-out attack. Han Zhenyuan, Cai Yanxiong, and Yin Guiren were like tigers released from their cages, very active, chasing the score to 20-22, only one goal behind. At this point, Xiexing was also unwilling to be idle, so the battle became white-hot again. Soon, Jinan, with its hard work, finally tied the score at 26-26. Then, Wang Nanzhen committed a foul. Zhang Jinxiang made the free throw, and Xiexing took the lead again by one point. At this time, there was only one minute left until the end of the game. Everyone thought Xiexing would win. Unexpectedly, with two seconds left, Wang Nanzhen dribbled deep, suddenly had a flash of inspiration, and made a long shot, scoring a goal. Before the center circle jump ball could happen, the whistle blew, ending the game. Xiexing lost by one point, a truly unfortunate situation.</p>

<h3>Tiecheng Cup Basketball; Chongde Overpowers Qixiu</h3>
<p>Another, Danxing and Guangdong Lidui Win; Tonight, Dongya vs. Jiangwan, a Fierce Battle</p>
<p>Yesterday in the Tiecheng Cup basketball tournament, there were four Group B games. Danxing defeated Jianmin in Group B3, Guangdong defeated 27 in Group B2, Lidui defeated Jiangwan in Group B1, and Chongde defeated Qixiu in Women's Group B. The games between Lidui and Jiangwan, and Chongde and Qixiu, were fiercely contested and beautifully performed. Tonight's Group A game is between Dongya and Jiangwan. Dongya has many brave players such as Xu Ruiquan, and the team has excellent cooperation and fast passing, with considerable strength. The Jiangwan team is the embodiment of Fudan. They overcame McLing in the Western Youth League, and their strength is self-evident. The encounter between the two tonight is sure to be a fierce battle. In addition, the Women's Group B game between Huadong and Aiguo is also worth watching. The results of yesterday's games and today's schedule are recorded below.</p>
<p>Danxing defeated Jianmin (B3), 42-17</p>
<p>Guangdong defeated 27 (B2), 39-13</p>
<p>Lidui defeated Jiangwan B (B1), 25-22</p>
<p>Chongde defeated Qixiu (Women's B), 15-10</p>
<p>Chongde and Qixiu are originally sister schools, but Chongde has a longer history, and Qixiu has not been organized for a year, so it is inferior. Chongde's Li Yunzhi is short, agile, and active throughout the game, scoring the most points. Qixiu's Wen Ai's skills are also commendable, but the team's cooperation is not as good as Chongde's, and many long shots led to failure. In the first half, Chongde led 8-4. Both sides defended strictly, and it was not easy to score. In the second half, Qixiu tried to counterattack, losing by only one point with a score of 7-6. The intensity of the competition can be seen. As a result, Chongde overcame Qixiu 15-10.</p>

<p>The Lianghua basketball team, a mixed group from the North China basketball community, once invaded Shanghai and competed with strong teams from China and the West. However, they were oppressed by the "pirate" McLing and did not achieve very satisfactory results. Their disappointment has not yet dissipated. It is now reported that the team has gathered talents and reorganized, and is scheduled to arrive in Shanghai on the 20th of this month to make another visit, intending to discuss techniques with teams such as the pirate McLing and Xiexing Jinan. They have entrusted the National Sports Association to contact the above five teams to arrange the competition dates, which are listed below.

<h3>Second Week of the China Youth Volleyball League; Guangyi vs. Hujiang</h3>
<p>Six Group B Matches; Taishan vs. Guanghua Group; Taishan Withdraws; Yiyuan Rubber Factory Donates a Silver Cup to the Group B Champion</p>
<p>The China Youth Standard Dahua Cup Men's and Women's Volleyball League has been held every Saturday since it opened on the 7th. Today is the second week, with a total of nine matches. In Group A, Hujiang will face Guangyi, starting early at 3:30 PM. Guangyi made its debut the night before and defeated the strong Jinan team 3-1, gaining momentum and showing a potential to win the championship. Moreover, the Guangyi team members all have considerable experience and are prominent figures in Chinese volleyball, such as Wei Dingyi, Yu Xunzi, and Huang Yufu, who are rare talents. The smashing skills of Mai Bingyao in the front row are outstanding, and the veterans Situ Shan and Zeng Yuru in the back row are also able to fulfill their responsibilities in the passing game. Hujiang's Li Shufen, Huang Hanming, Ruan Shuyou, and Zou Guoxiong are also strong players. Although it is difficult to guarantee victory when they meet Guangyi today, it can be said that the game will be tight and intense. There are six Group B matches. The game between Guangdong and Yinghua is like a championship battle. In the last match, Taishan and Guanghua, Taishan has announced its withdrawal, and Guanghua wins without effort. In the two Dahua Cup matches, the Public Works Bureau and Wuben have even strength, while the match between Minli and China is clearly unequal. The Yiyuan team in Men's Group B is a new force, organized by the Yiyuan Rubber Factory. Out of great interest, they have donated a large silver cup to the Group B championship team of this year, named the Yiyuan Cup. Today's schedule and the lineups for Group A are as follows:</p>

<h3>Finance Swaps to Begin, Forecasts to be Posted by Bulls</h3>
<p>——Down Another Three or Four Yuan Yesterday——</p>
<p>Yesterday, the gold market was still extremely crowded with long positions. There was a lack of upward momentum, and major players continued to exert downward pressure, making it difficult to sustain. Swaps are imminent, and buying interest seems to be waning. The foreign exchange market is trending looser, resulting in a continued downward trend. In the early morning, overseas calls indicated that the Bank of England's forward rates remained unchanged, with near-term rates falling by 625. American banks narrowed by one point. The downward trend in forward silver prices in Montreal had stopped. Calculations showed fluctuations of around 4% up or 3% down. Exchange rates were relatively soft, with the French franc showing strength. London spot gold decreased by half a penny. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with both British and American rates unchanged. The Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged. The standard gold price was listed at 1148 yuan. Swaps are imminent, and the premium will need to be posted by the bulls at over ten yuan. In terms of leverage, the bulls are still extremely crowded, and buying seems weak. Off-market preliminary trading opened at 48-49 yuan, and major players like Fuxing Yongheng and others immediately began selling. Lacking support, it fell to 45-46 yuan. The morning opened with a low, but buyers took advantage of the low prices to maintain support due to Socony Vacuum Oil Company buying US dollars, allowing it to rise. However, the situation was calm. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official rates were announced, with both British and American rates unchanged. At this point, supply and demand were balanced, and it hovered around six yuan. When the silver equalization tax was announced, dropping 3.75, people's sentiment was unaffected, and buyers were more balanced, with a slight increase at one point. Chinese merchants released US dollars, and the domestic market gradually loosened, with sellers gradually becoming stronger and moving downward, but there was considerable struggle along the way. Japanese banks released shillings, and with forecasts of an eight-anna increase in Indian silver, major players suddenly sold heavily, leading to weakness. However, the shorts covered at the low, and it was still sustainable at noon. The afternoon market was calm, with limited fluctuations, and the foreign exchange market was extremely stable, hovering around four yuan, without any disturbances, as quiet as still water. In a short two-hour period, there was only an eight-jiao price difference. Telegrams from Indian silver indicated that sellers were setting up positions, resulting in no transactions, and official rates were reported unchanged. After this, people's sentiment stabilized slightly, and major players entered slightly, causing a rise, but there was supply again at the high, and it remained stable. It was slightly weaker after the market. Today, the official February swap is about to begin, and preliminary forecasts indicate that it will be posted by the bulls at around ten yuan. I will record today's market conditions below.</p>

Tongyu Run Xiangfeng still sold, retreating to 3.70 yuan. Hengyu Fuxing Yong still came to buy positions, rising again to above four yuan. Telegrams from Indian silver indicated that there were too many sellers, lacking transactions, but the official rates were unchanged. After this, the situation was even more stable. Yifeng Yong Fengchang Hengyu bought positions, rising to 4.70 yuan, but Fuxing Yong Chunyuan Yong supplied positions at the high, and the close retreated to 1144.1 yuan. Ganyuan Yong sold positions after the close, becoming weak.</p>
<p>The settlement price was due to the Central Bank's standard gold price listing retreating to 1148 yuan, roughly around four yuan based on the closing price, more than four yuan lower than the previous close. The registration price for this month is 1135 yuan, and for the first month, 1144 yuan. The water replenishment in the morning was 1135 yuan, and the same in the afternoon. Fine gold remained the same as the futures, at 1145 yuan. The spot market was stable, with refined gold adding 6.15 yuan, bought by Tongfeng Heng from Siping, about 200 taels. Tianjin goods added six yuan, but there were no transactions. Preliminary forecasts for this year's first month swap for February indicate that it will be posted by the shorts at around ten yuan.</p>
<p>Trading in the market was normal, and there was even less in the afternoon. In summary, Yifeng Yong Xianghe Dingtai Hengyu Dingkang Qingfa Yong Fuyu Chunyuan Yong and others were on the buying side, while Yuansheng Yong Renfa Yong Tongfu Xiangfeng Hongkang Yong Shenda Yong Richang Yingfeng Heng Tianchengxiang Yuanmao Yong and others were on the selling side. Ganyuan Yong advanced and then exited, Fengchang exited and then entered, Dalian Shunli Wanxing and Guangdong's Hengyu Shengda were inactive.</p>
<p>Checking the day's market conditions, it was generally weak. The morning opened at 245 yuan, and the afternoon closed at 1144.1 yuan. The highest price was 1146.8 yuan in the morning, and the lowest price was 1142.6 yuan, with a fluctuation of 4.20 yuan. As a result, it continued to fall 4.30 yuan from the previous close. The total number of transactions was 8484 positions in the morning and 3332 positions in the afternoon. The total number of positions for this month, excluding public orders that have been cleared, is 12,243 positions, with a total of 56 long positions and 36 short positions.</p>
<p>Yesterday's public orders were resolved by Yingfeng Heng for 14 positions. Long positions "receivable" include 7 positions each for Fuxing Yong and Shenfeng, with a settlement price of 1135 yuan. This month's positions are thus completely cleared.</p>
<h3>Banks Oversupplying, Foreign Exchange Market Ends Loose and Flat</h3>
<p>According to foreign telegrams yesterday, London's large forward positions remained unchanged, with near-term rates falling 625. It was said that there were a large number of sellers, and the United States bought 18 percent. There were no recorded news after the market closed. The New York silver market narrowed by one point. Forward silver prices in Montreal remained unchanged, with fluctuations of around 3% down or 4% up. London spot gold decreased by half a penny. The British to American rate was unchanged, the American to British rate increased by 125, the American to French rate increased by 1.5, and the British to French rate decreased by 13 pounds. The foreign exchange market opened in the morning with near-term selling prices of British exchange at one shilling, two pence, three seven five, and US exchange at 29.5 yuan. Compared to the previous close, both British and American rates were unchanged. The Central Bank's official rates were announced, with both British and American rates unchanged. The Customs Gold Unit remained unchanged. Chinese merchants' sentiment was weak, but due to Socony Vacuum Oil Company still buying, the opening was still peaceful. The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation's official rates were announced, with both British and American rates unchanged. The process hovered. The silver equalization tax was announced late, dropping 3.75. At this point, although Chinese merchants sold, banks still bought and had many positions. After the rush, bank buyers gradually slowed down, and Chinese merchants still sold US dollars. Japanese banks released shillings, and forecasts of an eight-anna increase in Indian silver immediately hardened the process, but the afternoon trend was still in the market, because banks had different appetites, operating both buying and selling. The afternoon market was peaceful, and both supply and demand lacked significant actions, so the process was even more mediocre, and transactions decreased. Telegrams from Indian silver indicated that there were many sellers, resulting in no transactions, and the official rates were not changed. At this point, people's sentiment was slightly better, and banks took the opportunity to continue buying, but the Central Bank and Qiao Zhibu still sold, making it difficult to advance rapidly. By the close, near-term selling prices of British exchange were one shilling, two pence, three seven five and four three seven five, and US exchange was 29.5625 yuan. Compared to the previous close, the British rate loosened by 0.03125 and the American rate loosened by 0.0625. Chinese merchants still lacked significant inflows and outflows. Banks' appetite was oversupplied, and the Central Bank still sold. I will record today's transaction prices below.</p>

<h3>Securities: Actions of Both Sides in the Bond Market</h3>
<p>Shorts Initiate Swaps, Bulls Take Advantage of Opportunities</p>
<p>Yesterday, the trend in the Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange was gradually entering a period of leverage competition, which is a natural phenomenon given the large number of accounts. However, short selling was still the dominant force in swaps between both sides, leading to a chaotic market price with sudden highs and lows. Based on the amount of physical commodities submitted by the shorts, there may be a risk of short squeeze, but currently, the shorts are initiating swaps, while the longs are taking advantage of opportunities, indicating that the longs will also waver. Although there are no major changes in the environment, the North China incident has ultimately dampened people's spirits. The temporary trend is still one of sideways movement and weakness. The process yesterday saw that the opening price in the morning was unable to rise due to the selling of numbers 43 and 46. Only the long-term demobilization was raised by two jiao by number 69, while the rest uniformly trended lower, falling by one or two jiao to around half a yuan. In the second session, number 46 continued to sell, and numbers 71 and 78 also sold a lot. Market prices continued to weaken before and after. The Centralized Salt Tax was briefly raised by about one jiao by numbers 11 and 16. The afternoon opening saw fewer sellers, and the majority uniformly rebounded by one to four jiao. Only this month's 20 volume was lower by a jiao, and numbers 11, 20, 33, 35, and 69 all saw buying or swaps. The biggest increase was 560,000 in number 69 buying long-term demobilization, raising it by six jiao and a half. Only this month's demobilization improved by four jiao at the close, while the rest still felt unable to rise. After entering, number 32 turned physical, and number 54 also released positions, again weakening by one or two jiao. The trend ultimately felt unable to rise after struggling, and many accounts were preparing to sell, resulting in a very chaotic market price, with increases and decreases being very uneven. The biggest increase was five jiao for demobilization, while the decreases were only five fen to two jiao. The total number of transactions was 17.6 million. The results of the increases and decreases are listed in the comparison table on the left (unit: yuan, transaction unit: 100 yuan):</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Suddenly Panics</h3>
<p>—The Impact of the St. Louis Southwestern Railway Bankruptcy</p>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Company reported that yesterday (December 12), the New York stock market fell. The St. Louis Southwestern Railway had applied to the court for reorganization under bankruptcy law. The market heard this and suddenly panicked. Stocks on the small exchange were mixed but generally firm, and the bond market also saw mixed increases and decreases. The total number of shares traded throughout the day was 2.14 million. The Dow Jones New York Index is listed on the left:</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton: Yarn and Cotton Regain Gains in the Afternoon</h3>
<p>The yarn market initially fell and then rose, but the situation was calm. This was because most of the shorts were in the same industry, and there was a large influx of deliveries in the near month, putting significant pressure. Therefore, the opening price in the afternoon of this month saw a low of 193 yuan, which was more than ten yuan different from the forward price, indicating that the shorts were using the pressure of spot supply very strongly. However, the Osaka Sampin Yarn lineup was high in the near term and low in the long term, while the National Standard Yarn was the opposite. Currently, the yarn in warehouses has reached over 9,000 bales.</p>
<p>A Rise, Then a Fall, Then a Turnaround</p>
<p>The Standard Yarn market opened in the morning with a slight rebound of seven or eight jiao after the sharp fall the previous day, but the surface was quite loose. Ruidai was throwing out a particularly large amount, and it was rumored that deliveries were active, with 1,000 bales of 20-count Dafash yarn and 500 bales of other yarn already released into the warehouse. Therefore, after the second session, it entered a state of weakness again, and market sentiment became more and more weak. As a result, each month fell by six, seven, eight, and nine jiao to one yuan compared to the closing price of the previous day. The afternoon opening saw a new low in the near month, and the falling trend was particularly severe due to Mingde and Gengfeng long positions releasing positions. Unexpectedly, the second session opened, and Daji Taichang Changfeng Runkang took advantage of the price drop to profit by buying back short positions in a very large amount, so the market suddenly turned and rose. However, it had already fallen by more than ten yuan compared to the high price, so this was a necessary rebound. As a result, each month rose by five, eight jiao to one yuan two or three jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Dafeng sold 850 bales, Jinchang 750 bales, Mingde 1,800 bales, Ruidai 2,450 bales, Renfeng 1,950 bales, Yuan Yi 1,100 bales, Runkang 800 bales, Gengfeng 1,250 bales, Tonghe 800 bales, and Hexing bought 1,100 bales, Genglan 750 bales, Yidai 880 bales, Taichang 2,050 bales, Yongchang 650 bales, Xincheng 2,200 bales, Daji 1,550 bales, Changji 600 bales, Changfeng 1,050 bales, Runkang 1,650 bales. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for one day are as follows:</p>
<p>Yarn Type | Highest Price | Lowest Price | Closing Price | Change | Account Balance</p>
<p>---|---|---|---|---|---</p>
<p>December Future | 114.9 | 192.0 | 194.7 | Down 0.50 | 20,900</p>
<p>January Future | 196.3 | 194.4 | 196.2 | - | 23,200</p>
<p>February Future | 199.9 | 197.4 | 199.5 | Up 0.50 | 54,100</p>
<p>March Future | 202.2 | 199.6 | 201.3 | 0.20 | 69,500</p>
<p>April Future | 204.1 | 202.2 | 203.8 | 0.60 | 71,700</p>
<p>May Future | 205.5 | 203.5 | 205.0 | 0.60 | 27,950</p>
<p>Total | 277,450</p>
<p>Line Drops by Three Yuan, Yarn Drops by One</p>
<p>The sales of spot yarn are still good. It was found that the statistics for each gang buying throughout the day were 846 bales. The market fell by one yuan, and the line price fell by three yuan. The amount of purchases by each gang is as follows:</p>
<p>Yunnan: 200, Inland: 450, Same Industry: 35</p>
<p>Guangdong: 100, Nanjing: 19, Hankou: 35</p>
<p>Wuhu: 7</p>
<p>The cotton market fell in the morning and rose in the afternoon, and the market situation was stable. After the sharp fall in American cotton, it is now stable again, rising back by 5 to 11 pounds. People's sentiments are slightly calmer, but the sales of spot cotton have been sluggish recently. However, the long positions of Tongji and Xincheng are not only not releasing positions but are also buying more and more each day, supporting the market price.</p>
<p>Rose in the Afternoon Due to Short Covering</p>
<p>The Standard Cotton market opened in the morning because American cotton had a sharp fall and then showed a standard state. The Osaka Sampin cotton was also calm, and the market slightly showed signs of rebounding. The first session opened, and each month rose by two or three jiao. When it came to the second and third sessions, the selling trend rose again because the yarn market was trending down, and each month fell. As a result, each month fell by one or two jiao. The afternoon opening saw the yarn market return, and the financial sector and a part of the shorts suddenly came to buy back positions. Xincheng Tongfei Dafu Daji Weihe uniformly bought, so the market turned from weak to strong and gradually rose. By the time it closed, the auctions to the far months slightly slowed down. As a result, each month rose by two and a half to four and a half jiao compared to the morning closing price. It was found that Hengyi sold 1,800 dan, Yuanda 1,200 dan, Senkang 1,200 dan, Yuan Yi 3,300 dan, Yichang 3,300 dan, Shengyuan 5,500 dan, Yikang 1,600 dan, Yuan 1,600 dan, Gengfeng 1,900 dan, Shenchang 1,300 dan, Changyu 1,600 pai, Shenji 2,200 tiao, Yuanxingchang 1,700 dan, Dafu bought 5,100 dan, Meiji 3,100 dan, Tongji 2,400 dan, Hexing 1,300 dan, Renfeng 2,700 dan, Xincheng 6,300 dan, Daji 2,500 dan, Changhe 1,600 dan, Dafeng 1,200 dan. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices at one time are as follows:</p>
<p>Standard Cotton | Drop | Account Balance | December | 41.35 | 41.00 | 41.25 | Up 0.05 | 82,100 | January | 41.90 | 41.50 | 41.85 | 0.25 | 115,400 | February | 43.75 | 42.20 | 42.60 | 0.20 | 145,800</p>

<p>May | 44.25 | 43.75 | 44.10 | 0.15 | 21,500</p>
<p>Total | 177,450</p>
<p>Spot Sales Remain Flat</p>
<p>Spot cotton sales are still flat, and factory demand is sluggish. The source is 1,500 bales of Yao cotton and 1,900 bales of Tong cotton.</p>
<p>Hankou Fine Velvet: 49.00 Yong'an Factory bought 100 pieces, spot delivery to factory.</p>
<p>Maiflower 6: 2.00 Domestic and foreign factories bought 82 pieces, again, again</p>
<p>Again, again: 63.00 Again, again: 8 pieces, again, again</p>
<h3>American Cotton Still Weak and Unable to Recover</h3>
<p>—Another Decline After a Rise—</p>
<p>Yesterday, American cotton opened. Although the market situation was uncertain, the trend was still firm. News from Liverpool was good, and foreign merchants bought, with prices rising by 2 to 8 points per pound for various months. Subsequently, bulls liquidated, cotton farmers hedged, and Liverpool sold. Traders remained deeply concerned about silver bonds and the High Court's judgment, causing market prices to react. Before closing, traders sold at limit prices, and short positions covered, leading to another rally. Traders awaited developments, and finally, New Orleans sold, causing another weakening. Spot prices rose by 5 points per pound, and futures prices rose by 3 to 11 points per pound. English cotton spot prices fell by 12 points, and futures prices fell by 13 to 15 points. Indian cotton was sold by Japanese merchants, and bulls liquidated, offset by short covering and slight buying by European exporters. Pigot fell by 0.25 rupees, Oomra fell by 2.5 to 3 rupees, and Broach fell by 3 rupees. The original telegram is recorded on the left (dated the 12th).</p>

<p>According to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for Broach cotton on the 13th was 218.25 rupees, up 0.25 rupees from the previous day's close.</p>
<h3>Grains: Rumor of Rising Prices for Imported Wheat; Flour and Wheat Suddenly Surge</h3>
<p>The flour market opened this morning with frequent fluctuations, large ups and downs, and unprecedented chaos. At the opening price, due to imported wheat quotes, Chicago was up 4.5 cents in the near term and 1.5 cents in the far term, while Canada was down 48 cents. The market sentiment seemed stable at the opening, but by the second round, due to bulls selling, near and far terms fell by 1.2 cents. After the third round, due to factories not selling, some seized the opportunity to absorb, leading to a progressively serious situation. Buying interest was strong, better than the initial round by 1.2 cents. Over 700,000 bags were traded by midday. When the market opened in the afternoon, prices suddenly rose for no apparent reason, as rumors spread that imported wheat quotes were not falling but rising, reaching 6 to 8 cents. Bulls became active again, shorts turned long, and longs added to their positions. The opening price was up 5 to 6 cents from the morning. Trading remained active, and prices fluctuated. It is feared that the full absorption by powerful players will lead to unstable movements.</p>

<p>The wheat market opened this morning with initial stability, similar to previous days. After the second round, due to the rebound in the flour market, sentiment improved, and near and far terms rose slightly by 2 to 3 cents. When the market opened in the afternoon, all months continued to improve, as the flour market surged and imported wheat prices were higher than before, leading to renewed activity among traders. Compared to the morning, prices were up 3 to 5.6 cents. Regarding the current month, it is heard that over 20 trucks of goods for delivery have already arrived, mostly from Hankou. It remains to be seen whether all buyers will take delivery, which may be related to market fluctuations. The wheat market is currently stable, with Shandong wheat opening at 4.75 yuan, Jiangbei Huangqiao wheat at 4.73 yuan, Yangzhou wheat at 4.71 yuan, and Tiantai wheat at 4.64 yuan. Fuxin bought 4,000 bags.</p>

<h3>River Rice Sales Remain Weak</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, various sources arrived with a total of 40 to 50 boats (over 10,000 piculs of goods). The wholesale market in this street was sluggish due to the end of the month, and there were few buyers. Only Tianjin bought over 2,000 bags, so the market was mediocre. The price of thick early japonica rice was barely stable. Although thin indica rice also held its ground, high-quality goods continued to fall by 5 cents. Duyang pointed rice was flat. Yinbian yuan rice saw slightly more active sales, and the situation seemed tighter.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, 53 to 54 boats arrived from various sources along the river. The sales of white japonica rice in the market were still weak, and hoarders continued to push prices up, causing market prices to rise by a small amount to nearly a dime. Early indica rice followed slightly. Thin indica rice from Tianjin saw slight movement, and retail sales were normal. Prices showed a slightly soft trend. Yangbu pointed rice retail sales were weak, and prices showed a sluggish trend. Kejian pointed rice was stable. Yin yuan was stable, and the distribution of bian yuan for liquor became slightly more active, with prices tightening by nearly a dime. Prices for other goods also showed a soft trend.</p>
<h3>The Amount of Passenger Xian Rice Was Still Considerable Yesterday</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the arrival of passenger rice still included goods from Jiangxi, Hunan, Hankou, Shashi, Wenzhou, Taizhou, Fuzhou, and Nanjing. However, the number of arrivals from Wenzhou and Taizhou gradually decreased. Except for Jiangxi rice, which still had 3,000 to 4,000 bags arriving in Shanghai, the others only had small amounts of 300 to 500 bags. The sales in this street were not weak, and the market has been able to stabilize. Throughout the day, 3,145 bags of Jiangxi rice, 130 bags of Hunan rice, 800 bags of Wenzhou-Taizhou rice, 734 bags of Shashi-Hankou rice, 100 bags of Fuzhou rice, and 600 bags of Nanjing rice were sold, all handled by this street. Passenger hoarders were sluggish and had not purchased for many days, but hoarders still planned to wait for inquiries. Due to the river closure, the northern merchants may have to suspend operations.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: Zhenmei Green Tea Has Slightly Improved Sales</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the green tea market was still deserted. Gongxi green tea was sluggish due to poor sales to Russian merchants. Xiu Mei and Rui Mei teas also had considerable stockpiles due to the encroachment of Japanese tea on the markets outside the passes. However, Zhen Mei and Zhen Zhen teas had some movement in sales to Morocco. Yesterday, Xiehe, Yihuo, Yongfa, Baochang, and other firms bought over 200 boxes. Stem-picked goods sold for 88 yuan, and ordinary goods sold for 51 to 52 yuan, a decrease of 2 to 3 yuan from before.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: The First Batch of Sichuan Brown Sugar Debuts</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market saw gradually stabilizing trends with improved sales. The association's negotiated price for No. 24 raw sugar white spot was 21.1 yuan, with slight transactions. Re-exported goods were 6.85 yuan. The local factory's Mianbai Zhenji No. 1 was 20.8 yuan, up 0.1 yuan from the (11th). No. 2, 3, 4, and 5 remained unchanged. The Sugar Industry Cooperation Company auctioned 2,485 bags of Wuyang sugar white at 21.9 yuan, up 0.05 yuan, with 1,520 bags sold. Another 1,000 bags of re-exported Dutch raw white were at 6.85 yuan, also up 0.05 yuan, with 500 bags sold. The remaining No. 2 and No. 4 Mianbai were not sold at the original price. Dongchi NKC mark was 17 yuan, MS mark was 16.6 yuan, re-exported at 6.6 to 6.5 yuan, no transactions. No. 8 white (N) mark was 21.8 yuan, re-exported YT mark was 6.8 yuan, up 0.05 yuan, with transactions. No. 9 white SH mark was 21.6 yuan, re-exported at 6.65 yuan. Sichuan has always been famous for its local products. Now, suddenly, brown sugar is produced. What was once harmful, bitter soil has been transformed into sweet sugar. This is also good news. The first batch of 220 baskets of brown sugar has recently arrived. The quality of the goods is still good. Yesterday, it opened at 13.5 yuan, and the market was brisk.</p>
<h3>Hardware: New Shipments of Tinplate Arrived</h3>
<p>—Three to Four Times Higher Than Before—</p>
<p>Due to the trade restrictions with Italy, shipments of tinplate suddenly stopped for two to three months. Yesterday, new shipments of 40 to 50 boxes arrived. It was found that the orders were placed by hardware stores around North Suzhou Road. Over ten boxes have already been released, with No. 24 selling for 300 yuan per box and No. 26 selling for 150 yuan, both three to four times higher than before.</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Tiewu)</p>
<p>Last night, at a friend's place, I heard that a certain merchant was imprisoned for offending a certain battalion commander in a bathhouse. It turned out that when he entered the bath, the bath was extremely crowded. The battalion commander happened to be lying naked inside, making it difficult to recognize him. So he forced him to give up his seat. When he came out, he saw the battalion commander wearing his military uniform, realized his mistake, and tried to apologize, but to no avail, and was thus framed. From this, it can be seen that in the eyes of ordinary people, "one only sees the clothes and not the person."</p>
<p>In my village, A and B were longtime enemies who swore never to live together. Later, A joined the army and became an officer. B met him and prostrated himself repeatedly. Someone asked, "Why do you bow to your enemy?" B replied, "I am not bowing to him, but to his clothes." The two incidents are remotely related, both laughable and lamentable.</p>
<h3>Secret of Longevity</h3>
<p>— Zhuying</p>
<p>This time, through the introduction of a friend, I had the honor of meeting his 97-year-old grandfather. This old man, although 97 years old this year, still has bright eyes and a full set of teeth, having lost only two molars and three incisors. Although he was leaning on a cane, he walked very lightly. However, his ears were deaf. It is said that he became deaf due to illness at the age of seventeen. Therefore, when I met him, I asked questions in writing.</p>
<p>According to him, the reason he can live so long is that he is pure of heart and has few desires. He has never been promiscuous in his life. After his wife passed away at the age of forty-three, he lived a widower's life. He does not believe in religion, but he is very particular about his diet. He does not smoke or drink alcohol, and usually does not eat meat, only vegetables and tofu. At the age of fifty, he gave up his tea habit and only drank boiled water to quench his thirst. Although he is old now, he still walks for at least half an hour every day. He goes to bed no later than eight o'clock in the evening and gets up at five o'clock in the morning. Although the younger generation advises him to get up later, fearing that he will catch a cold if he gets up early, he has had the habit of getting up early for sixty years, so getting up late makes him feel uncomfortable.</p>
<p>He said that the reason he can live so long is partly due to taking care of himself and partly due to his deafness. Losing his hearing is indeed sometimes frustrating, but after a year or two of deafness, the habit has become natural, and he feels that not hearing is a blessing, saving him some worry. One of the easiest reasons for a person to age is to be nosy. If you are deaf, you cannot hear, you do not care about anything, you are not easily sad, and you are not easily angry. This is naturally one of the reasons for longevity.</p>
<p>The old man's method of longevity may be said to be very ordinary by some, but I think that even if it is so ordinary, it is not easy to learn.</p>
<h3>A New Theory That Chinese First Discovered the Cape of Good Hope</h3>
<p>— Te</p>
<p>The famous South African writer, Mr. Green, has explored the African continent for many years and discovered its strange secrets. He recently wrote a new book called "The Great Mystery of Africa." The book says: Today, everyone knows that the Cape of Good Hope in Africa was discovered by the great Portuguese explorer Dias, but in fact, the Chinese had already discovered it hundreds of years before Dias. A Chinese junk, sailing south along the African coast in ancient times, cannot be said to be a fantasy. Presumably, unintentionally, they traveled south of Cape Correntes, which was at the edge of the world they knew. The currents in the Mozambique Channel are very fast. Before the northeast monsoon, the junk was driven by the wind and could not return to the ports on the familiar east coast. The sailing directions for the south and east coasts of Africa issued by the British Admiralty can show what happened to such a junk that day. The ship was driven south until the warm Agulhas Current stopped it. Part of the warm current went around the southern coast of Agulhas and then northwestward, passing the Cape of Good Hope. The junk then advanced along the north current, reaching the Cape of Good Hope, or was mercilessly run aground by the sharp onshore currents on the rocks near Namaqualand, or more fortunately, run aground on the beach. There is no doubt that some ships have docked safely. Mr. Green offered evidence to prove his new theory, which is that there is a nation in Namaqualand to this day that has many of the same characteristics as the Chinese. His book also contains many valuable photos.</p>
<h3>Stance of the Haining Conference</h3>

<h3>Belt Hatred</h3>
<p>— Shijiu</p>
<p>Good times don't last, and beautiful clouds easily dissipate. This is truly a universal lament throughout history.</p>
<p>When a certain lady was studying at × school, she had a beautiful face and was known as the school flower. The way she turned her head and smiled, creating dimples, truly captivated many male classmates. However, although her appearance was as beautiful as peach blossoms, her heart was as cold as frost. It turned out that she already had someone in her heart. The person in her heart was a standard national with a leather belt. Young, handsome, and full of spirit! Their relationship was very close. Their footsteps were often seen in the reception room, and onlookers were not surprised. Also, the men in green were running around for them, and the telephone operators were also busy for them. In short, except for Sundays, they were almost always whispering sweet nothings directly or indirectly.</p>
<p>Having said that, wouldn't it be perfect for a beautiful woman and a brave man to become a couple? No, good times don't last, and beautiful clouds easily dissipate: before long, their relationship suddenly turned from marriage to enmity. She even lost her life under the leather belt, holding a grievance for eternity! The incident started when her boyfriend sent her a letter. Communication between men and women is normal in itself, but this letter angered the "standard national" and filled him with unbearable embarrassment. The lady, unable to express her grievance, initially cried loudly. Not enough, she then took the armed leather belt and struck it fiercely. Once, ten times, to the point of countless times. As a result, she vomited blood, fainted, and within a few days, her life was extinguished. The "standard national" grinned and said, "Bad luck for me, I lost another 300 yuan!"</p>
<p>Upon receiving the bad news, her friends all sighed and said, "The leather belt is terrifying!"</p>
<h3>The Swallow's Nest in Lujiabang</h3>
<p>— Ziming</p>
<p>The beginning of my third phase of smoke license renewal in Lujiabang on the Beijing-Shanghai line has passed for several days, but smokers are still waiting and unwilling to pay the license fees with their smoking funds. However, the office received orders from superiors, setting a deadline to complete the work. They had no choice but to take two police officers to check the Swallow's Nest.</p>
<p>In a street alley, after several twists and turns, they reached a smoking den where the house was about to collapse, the doors and windows were closed, and the smell of smoke seeped out through the cracks in the walls. Pushing open the door, they were assaulted by an even stronger, uncertain smell, which immediately made their heads dizzy. Three or five animals were wriggling in the darkness, facing a dim light like phosphorus fire. The three of us ran in, and they continued to hold their long pipes and suck, spitting out smoke, blowing bubbles, and drinking tea, seemingly living a life of peace in paradise. -- Only they were confident.</p>
<p>One police officer guarded the door, and another police officer with a northern accent shouted: "Bring out your smoke licenses." Several smokers lying on the tatami seemed to have been struck by lightning, trembling as they took out their smoke licenses. The owner, who was holding a scale to weigh the tobacco, stuttered with a blank stare: "They all have licenses!" "What kind of licenses are these? The second phase is useless. It expired long ago. You haven't obtained a new license. You are smoking privately, and the owner is selling privately. You all have to go to the station." One police officer said. They hurried: "Commissioner sir! We'll get the money and change them immediately, please be lenient." After checking the licenses one by one, I found that none of them had new licenses. So I told them to get licenses immediately and that this time they would be temporarily lenient, but next time they would not. I also advised them to quit smoking as soon as possible, but the darkness on their faces had been frightened to add a layer of purple. As if by agreement, they watched us leave their so-called peaceful nest. I believe their hearts were still beating.</p>
<h3>A Small Suggestion</h3>
<p>— (Yanjin)</p>
<p>Currently on the market, every store displays the words "Big Sale." In the past, there were spring sales, autumn sales, etc., but now there are big sales all year round. Therefore, the "Big Sale" banner is like a new store's sign, indispensable. Suppose opening a shop requires a "Big Sale" sign, but upon careful thought, since every shop has a big sale, it makes customers feel lost, which is equivalent to every shop not having a sale. In other words, there is nothing innovative. My intention is, why not have a store suddenly erect a sign that says "No Sale" or "Genuine Goods at Fair Prices" or "No Discounts" amidst the clamor of big sales from every shop. That would be a novel approach, but it could also be considered honest and trustworthy, and perhaps business would thrive as a result. (Transfer remuneration to aid disaster relief)</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twenty-Two: Heroic Words Move Rosy Lips, Beauties Gather for Discussion; Lu's Love Startles Jade Wrists, Bitter Woman Escapes Prisoner</p>
<p>He then smiled towards Beihai: Isn't that right? Our madam heard his family crying and talking downstairs, making quite a pitiful scene, so she told me to follow them to find out what was going on. Hokkaido: What did they say? That person smiled and shook his head and said: Honest people's speech has no way, saying things that don't make sense, and I have no way to ask them down. Our madam meant to have me go to his house to take a look. But I saw that they were so dirty, I really didn't want to go in. Saying this, he looked back and took a look, and said in a low voice with a smile: This is because I had an opinion here with the people in the hotel yesterday, and the madam cannot be cautious, so she sent me to take a look first. Beihai raised his hand and scratched his hair twice and smiled: If Commissioner Lan can make the decision in this matter, I, I… Saying this, he scratched his hair vigorously, and then said: I am willing to come forward to file a complaint. Only… He looked at the messenger, and the messenger suddenly made a silent smile. Beihai then thought that this sentence might be a bit insensible, so he smiled: What is your surname, sir? That person was even more proud, and immediately took out a business card from his body and handed it to Beihai. When Beihai looked at it, there were only two words, Fang Dade. At the same time, he also saw it himself, and immediately took back the business card and said that he would give another business card, which had an official title on it, namely a follow-up staff friend of the Northwest Inspection Commissioner of the National Government. Beihai originally felt that he had nothing to say, and borrowed the name of asking people for this turn. Now that he saw the business card of others, he felt that it would be disrespectful or inappropriate, and it would be even more inappropriate to compliment him; then he smiled and said oh. Fang Dade said: Your sir is very good, like the wife of that Zhou county magistrate… No, no, my words are a little awkward. That Zhou lady is very enthusiastic. He just went upstairs to see our madam and said that this woman could be saved. The two of them talked happily and for a long time, and our madam had long told me to talk to these two women. I talked for a long time, but I couldn't get in touch. Later, I didn't know what was the reason, they called out master and ran to the back. It was not until I sent them to the back door that they said that they had to run away with whoever offended the writer. When I wanted to chase after his house to ask questions, I felt that it was a little inconvenient for men and women, so I had to stand here and hope. (276)</p>
<p>Exclusive Interview with This Magazine</p>
<h3>A Visit with Mr. Ye Shengtao</h3>
<p>— Xiao Xian</p>
<p>After the news spread that Mr. Ye Shengtao, the one who "scared and deceived" people by giving a letter to a Suzhou native, was discovered, young people who generally love literature were shocked by the literary fame of the author of "Ni Huanzhi," and everyone wanted to meet this writer who enjoys a great reputation in the literary world. On a cloudy afternoon, Mr. Jingbo and I decided to visit this writer who we knew so well from magazines and newspapers. After figuring out Mr. Ye's address, we quietly set off for his residence. Entering Gunxiufang, we turned into Qingshi Alley, which was extremely quiet and gloomy. Garbage bins, thatched grass, high walls—everything looked as usual, lying there as dead as could be. Finding Mr. Ye's black lacquered gate, we rang the doorbell. A kind middle-aged woman opened the door, her face full of warmth: "Looking for Mr. Ye? Please come in." Her native accent led the two of us young men inside. In the house, a middle-aged man with a shaved head and a smiling gaze greeted us: "I am Shengtao." After some polite greetings, Mr. Ye invited us to his study. The shelves were filled with many thread-bound and Western-style books on education, literature, and philosophy, and several local newspapers and the Shen Bao were spread out on the desk. After drinking some tea, we asked many questions about the literary scene and the news of famous writers. Mr. Ye answered us sincerely. When he spoke, he often smiled, didn't wear glasses, didn't keep his hair long, was simple and plain, just like his works. He had none of the arrogant air of a literary figure, none of the pretentious taste of an artist—everything was concise, straightforward, and just like an ordinary person. We continued to talk about everyone's real-life situations, the future for men of letters. Then Mr. Ye said with a sigh, "Chinese men of letters have no future! The life of selling articles is an inhuman life. A young person who is faithful to literature, from learning to cultivation, from practicing writing to publishing works, spends a long time in between. However, if you can write and the newspaper or magazine is willing to accept your work, if you want to quit your other job to complete your work, the hope of this life is equal to zero! Moreover, with all kinds of external pressures, you cannot fulfill your wishes. People like Ba Jin, Tian Han, and Ding Ling are examples. What's more, if you want to wag a pen and sell a few coins to satisfy your stomach, you will starve to death! However, does Chinese culture not need this generation to create?..." We also asked Mr. Ye about his life as a teacher, his current life, the motivation for writing "Ni Huanzhi," the common language, the Latinization of Chinese characters, and many other questions. Mr. Ye very sincerely answered us one by one. A small alarm clock on the desk tirelessly carried away the precious moments. Mrs. Ye welcomed in a large group of young women. With reluctance, we said goodbye to Mr. Ye and this simple and quiet study. In the cold wind and drizzle, we hurried on our journey, and this sincere writer left an indelible impression in our minds.</p>

<h3>New Theories on the Treatment of All Diseases</h3>
<p>— Translated by the Editor</p>
<p>In recent times, medical scientists from various countries have a new understanding of the causes of various diseases, which is quite reasonable. They believe that the various symptoms that appear in diseases are the result of the body's natural protective ability fighting against external invaders. In other words, the stronger the body, the stronger the resistance to disease, which can often turn serious illnesses into minor ones, and minor illnesses into nothing. However, the body's original resistance varies in strength depending on the quality of each person's constitution, heredity, and environment. Therefore, the latest treatment methods now generally focus on gradually strengthening the patient's constitution, increasing their resistance, and overcoming disease to restore health. The "Reproductive Element" endocrine preparation from Standa, with its function of treating diseases and strengthening the body, restoring all parts of the body to their normal health, is truly in line with this principle. Therefore, it is popular around the world and is favored by famous doctors.</p>
<h3>Gospel of Smoking Cessation</h3>
<p>— Physician Ren Guoxiang</p>
<p>The principle of addiction to cigarettes lies in the fact that people who smoke for a long time are poisoned by the harmful components of opium, morphine, and heroin. These toxic substances can stimulate the nerves and endocrine system, causing a temporary excitement. As a result, the body presents a state of pleasure and invigoration. However, after a while, it turns to paralysis, so it is necessary to continuously smoke. This is the principle of addiction.</p>
<p>The difficulty of quitting smoking also lies in the fact that when smokers' addiction flares up, they feel that life is worse than death. Therefore, if there is a tonic that can eliminate smoking addiction, remove tobacco toxins, and restore the body's nerves and endocrine system to a normal state of invigoration, with natural pleasure, then why would people be willing to risk all dangers, violate the law, and indulge in tobacco poisoning? Standa's "Reproductive Element" is not only the aforementioned reasonable tonic, but also has the function of treating diseases and strengthening the body. Therefore, we use it to regulate the patient's body and quit opium, achieving the most beautiful and perfect effect. It is truly the supreme gospel for those who quit.</p>
<h3>The Harms of Masturbation</h3>
<p>— Physician Jia Zhizhong</p>
<p>Masturbation is a common disease among young people. Eight or nine out of ten secretly commit it, almost becoming an open secret. Masturbation is a bad habit that harms the body and destroys the will, causing extremely severe damage. It consumes essence and injures the spirit, which is equivalent to bloodletting and starvation. Those who commit it often suffer from nocturnal emission, premature ejaculation, kidney atrophy, and various other severe venereal diseases. Not only does their own health disappear and their lifespan shorten, but their offspring are also hopeless. Weak breeds and extinct races harm the country deeply and greatly. All those who are fathers and elder brothers should pay attention to prevent their children from indulging in this bad habit if they find them to be mentally depressed and pale and emaciated. They should earnestly advise and admonish them and administer "Reproductive Element" to nourish and replenish their consumed essence, so that they can quickly restore their health.</p>
<h3>Another Youth Saved</h3>
<p>— Contribution from Zhang Shuying</p>
<p>I am now twenty-eight years old. Three months ago, I looked like I was thirty-six or thirty-seven. I was born weak and suffered from nocturnal emission. Many times a month, my essence was greatly damaged, leading to weak brain, headache, forgetfulness, insomnia, and various other diseases. I suffered greatly. I spent money on seeing doctors and taking medicine for many years, but it was all ineffective. It was like a clay ox entering the sea, having no effect at all. As a result, I became pale and emaciated, my blood was gone, my skin relaxed, and wrinkles frequently appeared. I was prematurely aging. This summer, I sent a letter to this publication to ask about my illness. I was introduced to purchase Simiduo's Kidney-Strengthening Pills and Standa's Reproductive Element from the Western medicine department of Wing On Company. I took them according to the instructions, and the effect was significant. I have been taking them continuously for two months. Nocturnal emission has been eradicated early, and my body has become extremely strong. Now my blood and qi are abundant, and my mind is clear, which I have never had before. I am grateful for their saving grace and write a few words to express my gratitude.</p>
<h3>Treating Intractable Stomach Problems from the Root</h3>
<p>— Physician Yu Bofu</p>
<p>The stomach is located deep in the body, serving as the main base for absorbing nutrients from food. If it has problems and is not treated early, the stomach will become weak and stagnant, and the intake of nutrients will be insufficient, affecting all parts of the body, which will gradually decline. The treatment method should address both the symptoms and the root cause. "Stomach Pain Relief" can eliminate inflammation and relieve pain, effectively treating all kinds of intractable gastrointestinal diseases. This addresses the symptoms. "Stomach Strengthening Element" strengthens the stomach, improves appetite, and aids digestion. This addresses the root cause. Let me give an example to prove my point.</p>
<p>The patient, Gao Dekang, suffered from stubborn stomach problems. He had taken various medications but could not be cured. Last month, he was introduced by Mr. Fu Jiarui to seek treatment at my place. I used the above two medications to address both the symptoms and the root cause. Within a month, he was completely cured. This shows that medical knowledge is something that those who pay attention to hygiene should know.</p>
<h3>A Case of Cured Premature Ejaculation</h3>
<p>— Contribution from Ruan Zhongyin</p>
<p>My body was originally weak. In my early years, I was induced by bad friends, which led to qi and blood deficiency, cold limbs, trembling body, dizziness, blurred vision, and mental fatigue. I suffered greatly. I took various tonics repeatedly, but their effectiveness was minimal. After getting married at the age of twenty-two, I suffered from premature ejaculation. Since getting married until now, almost ten years, I have not had a son or a daughter. Although I took a concubine, she also had no children. Later, I read in a medical book that premature ejaculation is related to descendants. So I sought out a venereal disease expert. I was introduced by a friend to consult with Dr. Zhan Nianzeng. He treated me with radio wave therapy and instructed me to take Reproductive Element internally. After three months, my function was restored, my marrow was full of essence, my manhood was normal, and there was no more premature ejaculation. Now, my wife happily reports that she is pregnant. Recalling his merit, I specially record the whole story to inform those with the same disease.</p>
<h3>Nervous Weakness is Painful and Unbearable</h3>
<p>— Physician Qiao Wenbin</p>
<p>The patient, Weng Zijing, was weak and often sick. Also, due to his heavy workload, he was overworked, which led to nervous weakness. His body trembled, his limbs were cold, his waist was sore, his back ached, he was mentally exhausted, and his muscles were thin. He took various medications repeatedly, but the effect was lacking. This spring, he was introduced by Mr. Lu Senchu to seek treatment at my place. Mr. Lu had also suffered from the same disease and was cured by me. I immediately used this experience and instructed Mr. Weng to purchase "Reproductive Element" from Zhengwei Pharmacy. Before taking two boxes, the effect was significant. After taking several boxes continuously, the long-standing disease suddenly disappeared. Now Mr. Weng's muscles are full and abundant, and his spirit is refreshed. He is like a different person from before.</p>
<h3>Masturbation Weakens the Body and Causes Frequent Nocturnal Emission</h3>
<p>— Physician Wang Shiying</p>
<p>The patient, Fan Shichang, suffered from nocturnal emission due to excessive masturbation, causing his sperm valve to loosen. He suffered from insomnia and forgetfulness, and he was miserable. He delayed seeing a doctor and taking medicine, and he drifted along until now. Later, with his marriage imminent, and the trend of nocturnal emission becoming more and more serious, occurring as many as seventeen or eighteen times a month, he began to seek help in every possible way. He was introduced by Mr. Ren Tinglun to seek treatment at my place. I prescribed a large amount of Simiduo's Kidney-Strengthening Pills, which immediately stopped the emission. He also took Reproductive Element to nourish and replenish his body, and his body quickly recovered its strength.</p>
<h3>Disease Q&amp;A</h3>

<p>Mr. Wei Qiwang asks: (omitted above) and it is the right time to take supplements in winter. Based on the above, please recommend a tonic in your publication. (Answer) "Reproductive Element" is most suitable for nourishing the body in winter.</p>
<h3>Records of Venereal Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhan Nianzeng</p>
<p>(Clinic) 2nd Floor, China Trust Company, Corner of Sichuan Road and Beijing Road</p>
<p>1. Kidney Atrophy and Thin Essence, Hopeless for Offspring</p>
<p>The patient, Mr. Tan, 37 years old, from Ningbo, holds an important position in a bank in this city. When Mr. Tan was young, he was poisoned by lewd books, which led to the bad habit of masturbation. He did not stop until after marriage. However, because he was ignorant of the principles of abstinence and maintenance, his youth glands were destroyed, leading to kidney atrophy. Not only was he hopeless for offspring, but he was also ridiculed by his wife. Mr. Tan was filled with shame and anger, and his nerves gradually became weak. He was extremely tired of his job and miserable. Although he had seen doctors and taken medicine, there was no improvement. Later, he saw that Mr. Feng, a colleague at a large money house, had the same disease and was cured by me. He asked him to introduce me to him. I told him the ways of health maintenance and applied scientific surgical radio wave therapy to sense the nerves in his perineal area. I also instructed him to take Reproductive Element internally for about seven or eight weeks. The kidney atrophy was cured, and his essence was thick and powerful. This autumn, Mr. Feng talked about his second wife being pregnant.</p>
<p>2. Youth Gland Weakness, Frequent Nocturnal Emission in Patient</p>
<p>The patient, Qian Xiaopei, 29 years old, from Wujin, is a merchant in this city. In his early years, he suffered from the bad habit of self-harm. He relied on his strength and never quit, which led to weakness of the youth glands and the formation of nocturnal emission. He suffered from headaches, dizziness, blurred vision, confusion, weak memory, and inability to concentrate. He knew the harm and quit, but he could not completely quit. The number of nocturnal emissions increased from several times a month to more than ten times. He also suffered from insomnia at night, and his nerves were extremely weak. He was mentally depressed, pale and emaciated, and had no blood color. After marriage, he felt that he had severe ejaculation problems. Although he had taken various tonics, they were only somewhat effective. This spring, his colleague Mr. Dian Jitang introduced him to consult me. In addition to applying electrical sensory therapy, I also instructed him to purchase Simiduo's Kidney-Strengthening Pills and Reproductive Element from Chinese and Western pharmacies and take them together according to the instructions. Before half a dozen were finished, the nocturnal emission was eradicated, and his body was strong and healthy. He was like a different person from before.</p>
<p>(Note) Dr. Zhan's clinic is open from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Closed on Sundays.</p>
<h3>Brief Description of Kidney Disease Treatment</h3>
<p>— Physician Zhou Xiaohan</p>
<p>Quitting Smoking and Regulating Kidney Deficiency Cured</p>
<p>The patient, Tao Shizhou, 44 years old, from Pudong, works in a certain agency. Ten years ago, he had a serious illness and did not recover properly, which led to physical weakness and soreness in the waist and back. He took many tonics but could not achieve the desired effect. Later, he accidentally smoked opium at a friend's place and felt somewhat relieved. So he smoked it frequently. Over time, he became addicted. It was inconvenient to smoke, but it was not easy to quit. He felt even more distressed. Recently, due to the government's strict prohibition, it was especially inconvenient for him to continue smoking as a civil servant. So he sought to quit in every possible way. Later, he saw that his colleague Mr. Luo had been regulated by me during his smoking cessation and had achieved complete success. So he also sought help from me. I instructed him to purchase Reproductive Element from Jicheng Pharmacy. It could treat his kidney deficiency and weakness, and regulate his sick body during the quitting period. He took it according to the instructions. During the quitting period, he was mentally happy and could continue to work as usual. After quitting, his body quickly recovered, and all his old illnesses disappeared. His state of health was unprecedented.</p>
<p>Simiduo's Kidney-Strengthening Pills also cured a nocturnal emission patient</p>
<p>The patient, Ma Yuqing, 31 years old, from Rugao, is in the business world. In his youth, he was misled by lewd books, which poisoned him and caused the bad habit of masturbation. He did not quit until he was about to get married. Before long, he developed nocturnal emission. He suffered from insomnia, forgetfulness, mental fatigue, and physical weakness. He mistakenly took stimulants, which caused even more harm. After marriage, it was a marriage in name only. The couple's feelings were weak, and their happiness was lost. The nocturnal emission became even more serious, occurring almost every night. His essence was exhausted, and his waist ached. It was unbearable. Later, he was introduced by his close relative Mr. Xu Changhua to seek treatment at my place. I prescribed a large amount of Simiduo's Kidney-Strengthening Pills. Before he finished one box, it had a significant effect. He took several boxes continuously and the disease was eradicated. At the same time, I also instructed him to purchase Standa's "Reproductive Element" from Huamei Pharmacy to nourish and replenish his deficiencies. He took five boxes continuously. His body became strong, his essence was thick, his marrow was full, and his waist and back were strong. The couple's feelings were better than when they were newly married. Mr. Ma praised the effectiveness of Reproductive Element, saying that it was his reborn parents.</p>

<h3>Inspection of Power Transformers</h3>
<p>— Fuping</p>
<p>The most troublesome and easily problematic part of a transportation radio is the power transformer. The problems with power transformers can be analyzed as follows:</p>
<p>1. After the transformer is connected to the power supply, there is no voltage supplied to the secondary high-voltage or low-voltage coils.</p>
<p>2. The high voltage after rectification exceeds or falls below the standard value.</p>
<p>3. The transformer overheats excessively.</p>
<p>Regarding the first problem, it is of course best to use an accurate AC voltmeter to measure it, but not every amateur can afford this instrument. Now we can solve many problems simply by using a light bulb (25, 40, 75 watts are all acceptable), which is a household necessity.</p>
<p>First, connect the light bulb (25, 40, 75 watts are all acceptable) across the two ends of the primary input line of the transformer. Turn on the radio switch, and the light bulb should emit full brightness. This indicates that the input power supply is correct. Then, change the connection to series the light bulb with the primary coil of the transformer, as shown in Figure 1. Completely remove the vacuum tubes of the radio, so that the transformer has no load. At this time, the current passing through the primary coil and the light bulb should be extremely weak, only enough to make the light bulb emit a faint red glow, or even not light up at all. The second step is to briefly short-circuit each secondary coil one by one. At this time, the light bulb should suddenly increase its brightness at the moment when the secondary coil is short-circuited, indicating an increase in the primary current due to the load. This temporary short-circuit test will not burn out the transformer, because the light bulb in series with the primary coil is sufficient to limit excessive current. If the light bulb's brightness does not increase when one of the secondary coils is short-circuited during inspection, it can be determined that the coil must be broken and no voltage is supplied. If the light bulb does not light up at all throughout this entire short-circuit test, then undoubtedly the primary coil must be broken. The core of the second problem is that the voltage of the secondary high-voltage coil is incorrect. If there is an AC voltmeter that can be measured, then of course there is no problem. However, if you don't have one, you can also solve it according to Figure 2. The diagram shows a common rectifier circuit. Connect a 4mtd filter capacitor to the DC output, and then connect a high-resistance DC voltmeter across it. The value indicated by this DC voltage is 1.4 times the secondary AC high voltage (RMS value) of the transformer.</p>
<p>The voltage of each half of the high-voltage coil can also be disconnected at point X or Y and measured separately. The values measured on both sides are best equal, and at most can only allow a difference of 2 1/2%, which is not a major problem.</p>
<p>Now let's discuss the third problem, which is also the most common problem with power transformers. When the transformer is working, it inevitably generates heat because it has to lose some power itself, but there is also a certain limit to the heat generation. Usually, the safe limit for the heat generated by the power transformer of a radio is at most 45 degrees Celsius above the surrounding air temperature.</p>
<p>Excessive heat generation in transformers, in addition to design errors and the use of mismatched voltages, can also be caused by: (1) a large difference in the current in the two halves of the full-wave rectified high-voltage coil, (2) one or more secondary coils being overloaded, and (3) short circuits between coils.</p>
<p>The inspection procedure for cause (1) is to connect a milliammeter to the wiring between each plate of the rectifier tube. The two plate currents measured should be exactly equal, or at most differ by no more than 10%. If it is found that there is too much difference, the wiring of the transformer to the two plates can be exchanged to test it. If after the exchange, the plate with the smaller current is still the one with the smaller current before, then there is undoubtedly damage to the rectifier tube. If the plate with the smaller current also exchanges due to the exchange of the transformer wiring, it can be determined that the problem lies in the center tap of the transformer, which is not an accurate voltage center point.</p>
<p>As for cause (2), it is mostly due to the user's carelessness, causing the secondary application current to exceed the value specified by the transformer manufacturer. The impact is relatively small in the low-voltage coil, but it has a great impact in the high-voltage coil. Even if it only exceeds a few milliamperes, it is enough to burn out the transformer. For example, if the high-voltage coil is 60m.a., and the current is now 70m.a., this excess current of 10m.a. is about 17% of the specified value. The heating effect generated by the current passing through the conductor is directly proportional to the square of the current, so this overload current is sufficient to increase the temperature of the transformer by up to 36% above the normal state. With prolonged use, it will naturally damage the insulation layer of the transformer and cause a short-circuit risk.</p>
<p>If the transformer is found to be generating heat, and the inspection determines that it is not due to the above two causes, then it is undoubtedly due to the third type of short circuit. Unfortunately, there is really no simple way to test where the short circuit occurred. Fortunately, there is no more effective way to remedy a transformer that has already short-circuited than to disassemble and rewind it.</p>
<h3>The Principle of Directional Antennas</h3>
<p>— Chongling</p>
<p>Most wireless telegraph and telephone communications are unidirectional, with a fixed direction between each station, which differs from the omnidirectional purpose of wireless broadcasting stations that broadcast messages in all directions. In order to save power, reduce losses, concentrate power in one direction, keep messages secret to avoid interception by others, or increase the number of stations and reduce interference from co-wave stations in other directions, large-scale wireless telephone and telegraph stations are equipped with directional antennas for unidirectional communication. For example, international wireless communication between countries uses directional antennas as a tool for unidirectional transmission and reception. For this type of unidirectional communication, the transmitting station must have directional transmitting antennas, and the receiving station should also have directional receiving antennas. Although the system of directional antennas varies from station to station, the basic principles of antenna directionality are the same.</p>
<p>A vertical antenna, when energized with a high-frequency current, can radiate radio waves around it, using the ether to transmit them to a distance. The radio waves generated in this way are scattered in all directions along a plane perpendicular to the antenna. In other words, the distribution of the wave field can be represented by a circle with the antenna as the center, as shown in Figure 1. a is the vertical antenna, and F is the wave field. Therefore, the strength of the radio waves is equal at any point equidistant from the antenna in any direction.</p>
<p>If another similar vertical antenna b is erected at a half-wavelength (λ/2) distance from antenna A, as shown in Figure 2, the wave field radiated by antenna b is naturally no different from that shown in Figure 1. If the currents of antenna a and antenna b are in phase (Same Phase) and have the same frequency, then in the plane formed by the two antennas ab, because the radio waves radiated by b arrive at a later than the radio waves radiated by a by exactly half a wavelength, with a phase angle difference of 180 degrees, the two radio waves cancel each other out. In other words, the positive wave of a and the negative wave of b add up, and the negative wave of a and the positive wave of b add up, so the result is zero. Therefore, no radio waves are generated in the direction shown by the plane of the two lines ab. However, in the direction perpendicular to the ab plane, the radio waves emitted by the two wireless antennas combine with each other to obtain a combined wave field, shaped like the number "8", as shown in Figure 2FF. Therefore, with this type of setup, radio waves can only be radiated in the direction perpendicular to the ab plane, which is a two-way radiation. (To be continued)</p>

<p>Since this publication published (Mr. Juan's) article "Self-Generating Radios" in previous issues, it has made me recall the matter of "experimenting with self-generation" without obtaining good results. Although moving from fantasy to experimentation inevitably involves some unreliability, how could the new discoveries sought by researchers not start with ideals and then begin with experimentation? Therefore, fantasy is indeed the source of new discoveries!</p>
<p>Several years ago, when the author was still working in an industrial company (in the Electrical and Mechanical Department), there was a time when everyone was idle and had nothing to do, so they turned on a (one-tube detector, one-tube high-power low-frequency amplifier, one-tube rectifier) AC three-tube radio for entertainment. Before it had been on for ten minutes, the vacuum tubes suddenly went out. This problem often occurred in our company; as long as a fault occurred in a part of the current or electrical machinery, the company's current would likely be cut off. Therefore, a technician colleague first suggested that the generator (Dynamo) generate electricity itself, so that on the one hand, it would no longer be affected by power outages, and on the other hand, it could be used for an on-site experiment. Therefore, the author also strongly agreed with his suggestion. However, the incoming power supply for the AC radio was 220 volts. If a generator were installed to supply the AC radio, a generator with the same voltage value would inevitably be required. Because the design and cost were uneconomical, the power supply voltage of the AC radio was changed to 25 volts, with the secondary voltage and current the same as the original. After several designs, it was successfully achieved (see Circuit Diagram A). The generator was a 25-volt AC power supply (25.v A.C. Dynamo), with a power capacity of 2 kilowatts (zo.Watts). The inner circle (2) of the generator was the prime mover, and its rotational force was connected to the generator via a mainspring disc and gears, rotating at a speed of 450 to 500 revolutions per minute. The structure was similar to that described by Mr. Juan, but the rotational load had to be stronger, otherwise, when the power supply was connected and used, the prime mover would inevitably be burdened by the weight of the generator until it stopped. Therefore, the generator's rotating shaft should be as light and agile as possible, and the prime mover's transmission force should be as strong as possible. Although the purpose of self-generation was achieved, the annoying alternating current noise and static obscured the music. No matter how much filtering was done, the alternating current noise could not be completely filtered out, which was an imperfection. After several days of modification, although the alternating current noise was improved, the effective power could not be increased. The voltage was too low because the lowered volts were blocked by several high-frequency choke coils (see KFG in Diagram B). In order to replenish the input voltage, the primary of the power transformer was changed to 20 volts. This was considered a great success, but the timing of the prime mover eventually became annoying because the mainspring handle had to be cranked every seven or eight minutes, otherwise, the radio operation would stop. Because these were all practical experiences, the entire experimental process was written out in detail. Although the generator was no longer a problem, the prime mover had to be improved. However, the area that needed improvement was to extend the timing (the author lengthened the mainspring, but the transmission force was weakened), otherwise, tightening the mainspring every few minutes would not be as convenient and refreshing as using AC power or batteries.</p>
<h3>Direct Current and Alternating Current</h3>
<p>— Qiong</p>
<p>There are two types of current: direct current and alternating current. When current flows through a conductor, its direction remains constant and unchanging; this is direct current. Examples include the current generated by batteries and direct current generators. Diagram A illustrates direct current. When current flows through a conductor, its direction changes back and forth over time; this is alternating current. The current used for ordinary electric lights is alternating current. The current of alternating current not only changes its direction with time but also varies its value. This type of current initially increases gradually from zero to its maximum value, then gradually decreases from its maximum value to zero, and then reverses direction, increasing again to its maximum value in the opposite direction and then decreasing to zero. This cycle continues indefinitely, as shown in Diagram B. From a to b is one cycle, from b to c is also one cycle, and c to d is another cycle. The number of cycles that alternating current flows per second in a conductor is called the frequency. Alternating current is further divided into low-frequency and high-frequency current based on its frequency. For example, the current used for ordinary electric lights and motors has three frequencies: 60, 50, and 25 cycles per second. Furthermore, the current used to transmit sound in wired telephones typically ranges from 30 to 10,000 cycles per second. Because its frequency is relatively low, it is called low-frequency current or audio frequency current. As for the current flowing through wireless radio antennas, it typically ranges from 10,000 to 100,000,000 cycles per second, which is extremely high. Therefore, it is called high-frequency current or radio frequency current. Commonly used batteries cannot generate alternating current. Alternating current at 60 or 50 cycles per second is generated by alternating current generators, which are driven by steam turbines. This type of alternating current can also be used to supply power to wireless radios, such as the voltage supplied to the filaments and plates of vacuum tubes. However, the high-frequency current generated by wireless radios is not easily generated by ordinary generators. Currently, it is generated using vacuum tubes.</p>

<h3>General Overview of Gonorrhea in Men and Women</h3>
<p>— (Physician Sun Jiwu)</p>
<p>The reproductive function of gonococci can last for several years. In men, they lurk in the posterior urethra. In women, they lurk in the glandular cavities of the cervix. Therefore, sexual intercourse with a person suffering from gonorrhea will inevitably lead to unfortunate diseases. This is clear from the nature of the virus and the prevalence of its infectivity. When the male genitalia are invaded by gonococci, urethritis usually results. If the female genitalia are invaded, the structure of the female genitalia is more complex than that of the male genitalia and is rich in mucous membranes, which are most likely to cause stubborn and harmful diseases. Adjacent organ parts are also easily affected. Therefore, once either men or women suffer from gonorrhea, they must be treated by a doctor. Early recovery is essential. Otherwise, men will infect women, and women will infect men. Such mutual infection will only intensify the virus. However, it is important to be careful when choosing a doctor and to adopt a healthy lifestyle. Treatment must be appropriate and reasonable. It is important not to delay or blindly follow others. The Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital, located at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, employs experienced physicians specializing in the treatment of gonorrhea, syphilis, and other diseases. It has long been trusted by patients. The hospital is well-equipped with powerful tools for treating gonorrhea, such as short-wave diathermy machines and Tias electric machines. The consultation rooms are elegant, and men and women are treated separately, which is particularly convenient.</p>
<h3>Acne and Pimples</h3>
<p>— (Pharmacist Ou Yin)</p>
<p>Acne, which occurs on the face of young men and women, manifests as small, red papules about the size of pinheads. Their tips have yellow pustules. If the papules are larger and the center is clearly suppurating, small scars will remain. Although each papule disappears after several weeks, they recur with treatment, constantly damaging one's appearance. This is most obvious between the ages of fourteen or fifteen and twenty-five. A complication is pimples, which are composed of keratin and sebum. They are about the size of sesame seeds, black in color, and consistent with hair follicles. When pressed out, they reveal a black front end and a yellow middle section, resembling a rice worm. The causes of acne and pimples include indigestion, abnormal nutrition, excessive sebum secretion, and diseases of the female reproductive organs. The treatment method is to regulate the stomach and intestines for those with indigestion. Apply "Mianli" cream externally for a complete cure. (Editor's note: "Mianli" cream is specifically for treating pimples, freckles, and other conditions. It functions to whiten the skin, remove blemishes, and is the highest grade of beauty product.)</p>
<h3>New Medicine for Leucorrhea</h3>
<p>— (Female Physician Shen Qinghuai)</p>
<p>If women are unaware of hygiene during menstruation, or suffer from gonorrhea, which persists for a long time, or suffer from blood deficiency, physical weakness, excessive sexual activity, mental stimulation, or colds, it can all lead to the symptoms of leucorrhea. If they continue to delay and ignore seeking medical treatment, the leucorrhea will increase, the affected area will fester, the body will gradually weaken, the skin will become pale, the complexion will become haggard, the appetite will deteriorate, and constipation will occur, which is enough to cause all kinds of diseases. It is not easy to conceive, and even if one conceives, it is easy to miscarry. Women in our country, constrained by etiquette, are ashamed to seek medical treatment when they suffer from this disease, and if they delay for a long time, they will develop uterine diseases, fallopian tube diseases, ovarian diseases, and lower abdominal distension, which are very dangerous. Now, the Wang Yuchu Female Physician Clinic, located at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has two kinds of medicine, one for internal use and one for external use, which are mild in nature and powerful in effect. They can treat mixed gonococcal leucorrhea and simple leucorrhea. They are suitable for both the old and the young, and pregnant women are not restricted. The price is two yuan per box for each kind. Based on my clinical experiments, I dare to introduce them to all the sisters in the country.</p>
<h3>The Relationship Between Spermatorrhea and Childbearing</h3>
<p>— (Physician Sun Weirui)</p>
<p>Those who have difficulty in childbearing often blame women. In fact, various diseases of men are also related. Spermatorrhea is one of the diseases. Its physical weakness is set aside for the time being, but it has a great impact on childbearing. According to medical experts, microscopic examination shows that those suffering from spermatorrhea mostly have immature sperm. The worms are extremely transparent, lying stiff and not lively, and have no mobility. They die in an instant. The membranes of the worms are either broken or contracted. The heads are small. The bodies are bent as if broken, or the tails are curled. There are various strange shapes. In the early stages of the disease, there are no other abnormalities. Later, the semen gradually becomes turbid and sparse. The secretions of the testicles gradually decrease. Sperm are rarely present. Even if a small number are mixed in, they are unhealthy. Unhealthy sperm make childbirth difficult. Fortunately, if there is childbirth, the child will not be strong either. Then, can those who have spermatorrhea not seek treatment as soon as possible? Among the medicines for treating spermatorrhea that can be effective quickly and have no side effects, "Healbond" pills are the most suitable. This has been repeatedly proven by our clinical practice and is trustworthy. (Editor's note: "Healbond" is sold by Tongren Western Drugstore, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinjiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai. The price is two yuan per bottle and is indeed a special medicine for treating all kinds of sexual neurasthenia. I venture to add a few words as an introduction.)</p>
<h3>Experiment of Ganlu for Treating Tinea Cruris</h3>
<p>— (Physician Zhou Kechang)</p>
<p>Shanghai Tongren Western Drugstore, in view of the widespread prevalence of skin diseases, has produced a special medicine for skin diseases called "Ganlu" after years of research. It has a miraculous effect and is truly an outstanding product. Now, I will select two or three of my achievements in treating tinea cruris for reference. (First case) Patient Mr. Li, from Pudong, is 37 years old and a tailor. In mid-April, small nodules appeared on his groin, which were unbearably itchy, especially at night. He had purchased skin medicine for treatment, but it was ineffective. Soon after, pustules continued to develop. Treatment: first wash the affected area with medicated soapy water, and then apply Ganlu. After five days, it completely scabbed over and fell off, and he was cured. (Second case) Mr. Zhang's groin skin was itchy, swollen, and had red rashes the size of hatpins. Treatment: Apply Ganlu for treatment according to the law. It was cured in a week. (Third case) Ms. Wang, from Changzhou, had dry white scales on the inside of both groins, which were abnormally itchy and prevented her from sleeping. Treatment: Apply "Ganlu" for treatment. Because she could not come to the hospital every day, she was given 50 grams of the product and sent away. Two weeks later, she came to the hospital with a happy expression, saying that her tinea cruris had been cured. She thanked me repeatedly.</p>
<h3>Miracle Cure for Freckles with Mianli</h3>
<p>— (Manuscript from Gu Yangwu)</p>
<p>Both my elder sister and I suffered from freckles. Some say it was inherited from our late mother. When asked to a doctor, he said that the skin pigment was deposited and could not be excreted and appeared on the epidermis. However, treatment for several months was ineffective. Freckle remedies sold in the market have also been applied, but the brown spots remain. This autumn, my elder sister returned to Ningbo. Seeing her clean, white, and rosy complexion, it was very different from the past. I asked her curiously, but she just smiled and did not answer. Slowly, she took out something from her luggage and showed it to me, saying, "This is the effect of 'Mianli'. Why don't you, my younger brother, apply it? Soon you will have the same complexion as me." I received it with half belief and half doubt, and applied it two or three times a day as directed. In less than half a month, all the spots were removed. Those who saw me were amazed. Unexpectedly, the freckles that my elder sister and I had suffered from since childhood were cured by "Mianli". I dare not keep it a secret, so I recorded it and submitted it to this publication.</p>
<h3>The Urgency of Women Quitting Smoking</h3>
<p>— (Physician She Zhen)</p>
<p>The harm of opium is known to everyone, especially in our weak country. Usually, we do not pay attention to exercise, and we lack common sense of hygiene. Women with weak resistance are easily infected with diseases. Once the disease is initially contracted, they do not rush to see a doctor formally. They often use opium as a panacea for treating diseases, and thus it becomes a habit over time. There are also those who suffer from hidden diseases and are ashamed to see a doctor, often relying on opium to relieve pain, and eventually become an indispensable addiction. There are also those who become addicted due to family difficulties or the bad influence of social circles. This is also often seen. As for those who secretly smoke due to difficulties in the family or to avoid external criticism, I know that there are many women in our country who do this. However, at this time of frequent national disasters, if we want to strengthen the country, we must first strengthen the race. The pregnancy of women is directly related to the way to strengthen the race. Moreover, the current government orders are strict. If men have bad habits, they should bravely move forward and resolve to quit. As for women who are addicted to this, based on the above situation, there must be quite a few. I sincerely hope that women who have the bad habit of opium will be alarmed for the sake of their bodies, their families, and their country, and quickly make a decision to quit it, so that the race can be strengthened and the country can be healthy. (Editor's note: Physician She Zhen, at No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, has rich experience in quitting smoking. Those who quit have no pain at all. The total charge for daily injections and internal medicine is only two yuan. The cost for those who are hospitalized is also very low.)</p>
<h3>Stomach Pain and Stomach Disease</h3>
<p>— (Physician Gu Zhenqun)</p>
<p>Stomach pain is not a disease name, but a symptom of stomach disease. Various stomach diseases can cause stomach pain, such as gastritis, gastric ulcer, stomach cancer, stomach nerve disease, hyperacidity, etc., all of which use stomach pain to indicate their course. Anyone suffering from one of the above stomach diseases has the pain of stomach pain. The initial onset of stomach pain is the initial formation of stomach disease, especially for gastric ulcer and stomach cancer, the prognosis is particularly poor, and stomach pain is even more obvious. There are many ways to treat it. In summary, the nutrition of food and drink and the appropriate application of drugs according to the condition are necessary. If the severe stomach pain is temporarily relieved with anesthesia and painkillers, it is not beneficial to the disease itself. Over time, it will become a habit and will harm the body. Only "Wei Bi Ling" treats stomach pain and stomach disease without any anesthetic drugs, and is suitable for the stomach's physiological secretion function and digestive elements. Therefore, its treatment range is broad, and its effect is great and fast. I hope those with stomach disease will be careful in taking medicine. (Editor's note: "Wei Bi Ling" is indeed a sacred product for treating stomach disease. It is said that each box sells for one yuan. Tongren Western Drugstore, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinjiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai, is the exclusive distributor.)</p>
<h3>Treatment Principles for Gonorrhea</h3>
<p>— (Physician Luo Minxiu)</p>
<p>Gonorrhea, commonly known as "white turbidity," can be transmitted from men to women and from women to men. Mostly, men get it from prostitutes. At the beginning, it is an acute period, with painful urination and frequent urination. Lack of hygiene can infect wives and children, which is unfavorable to both parties. Gonorrhea is easier to treat in the acute stage. If it develops into a chronic disease, treatment will take time. The Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital, located at Ningbo Road, French Concession, is equipped with various electrical treatment machines for gonorrhea. Early treatment can lead to a speedy recovery, as electrical treatment is the best method for treating gonorrhea in modern times. If the disease has infected wives and concubines, it is advisable to treat both parties together. The hospital employs female doctors specializing in the treatment of women's hidden diseases and uses microscopes to examine the progress of the disease at any time. If there is shame in seeking medical treatment, or if women are unwilling to seek medical treatment, it is important not to allow the disease to spread. Then there is a self-treatment method. What is the self-treatment method? You can purchase "Gonadodeng" pills from Tongren Western Drugstore, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinjiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai. The drug has extremely strong membrane-penetrating bactericidal power and no side effects such as stomach irritation. Both men and women can take it. Each box sells for only two yuan. Some can be eradicated after taking one or two boxes. It is truly a first-class medicine. I always use this drug when prescribing and it is always effective. I am writing a brief report for my peers.</p>
<h3>Medicine Q&amp;A Column</h3>
<p>If you have any questions about diseases or medicine, please send them to the Medical Advisory Office, Shanghai P.O. Box 1616, with return postage attached.</p>
<p>Where to Recuperate?</p>
<p>My elder brother has been suffering from hemoptysis and is addicted to smoking. His health is very weak. The doctor said that he should stay in the hospital for recuperation, but I don't know where is the most suitable place for recuperation in this noisy Shanghai. Where can he treat his illness and quit smoking at the same time, and where is the fee fair? (Asked by Yang Shiqi) (Answer) To find a good sanatorium, the first requirement is that the location should be quiet, spacious, and hygienic. The Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital, No. 980 Kang Nao Tuo Road, is the newest and most well-equipped sanatorium in Shanghai. Famous doctors are in charge of diagnosis, internal and external smoking cessation departments, and all are experts. The wards range from one yuan to four yuan, including meals, which is also very low.</p>
<p>Wonderful Beauty Products</p>
<p>Thank you for introducing "Dingli" to cure my deeply hated freckles. Now there are no more blemishes on my face. It is truly a wonderful beauty product. Now I have another symptom. I dare to ask for instructions. Because I have committed masturbation, it has led to the symptoms of spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation. I would like to ask what medicine I can use to treat myself without side effects. (Asked by Fei Yuanqi).</p>
<p>(Answer) Spermatorrhea and premature ejaculation are caused by sexual neurasthenia. In addition to a healthy diet and less desire, "Healbond" pills are the most effective and have no side effects. The price is two yuan per bottle and is sold by Tongren Western Drugstore in this city.</p>
<p>Twice Suffering from Gonorrhea</p>
<p>I suffered from white turbidity in the past year and was treated at the Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital in Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai. It healed in a few weeks. Now I have been infected with this disease again. I am troubled by the inconvenience of coming to Shanghai for treatment. Please introduce an effective medicine for internal use so that I can treat myself. (Asked by Luo Baohua)</p>
<p>(Answer) Among the medicines for gonorrhea, the most reliable drug with proven efficacy is "Gonadodeng". Each box sells for two yuan. You can directly purchase it from Tongren Western Drugstore, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinjiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai by mail.</p>
<p>Suffering from Scabies</p>
<p>I have been suffering from stubborn tinea. It is even worse in the summer. The itch is unbearable. The sticky liquid contaminates my clothes, which is quite unsightly. I have applied all kinds of tinea medicines, but they have little effect. I have always admired the accuracy of your magazine's instructions. Please give me a good prescription quickly. (Asked by Zou Yongming) (Answer) The "Ganlu" lotion sold by Tongren Western Drugstore, No. 1 Dexing Lane, West Xinjiao Street, Fada Road, Shanghai, is miraculously effective. One bottle is enough to cure it. I recommend it. The price is one yuan per bottle.</p>
<p>Cured My Acne</p>
<p>I used to suffer from acne. My cheeks and forehead were covered with it. I was introduced to use "Mianli". After applying it for three or four days, it disappeared and never recurred. I am grateful and happy. Now I want to ask, my wife has leucorrhea and it is very heavy, which is not suitable. But I don't know what self-treatment methods are available. Please tell me immediately. (Asked by Lin Qiujiang)</p>
<p>(Answer) "Internal Leucorrhea Pills" and "External Leucorrhea Medicine" sold at the Sun Weicai Father and Son Hospital, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai, are rare medicines for treating women's leucorrhea. They are most effective for self-treatment. The price is two yuan each.</p>
<p>Stomach Pain After Quitting</p>
<p>My father used to be addicted to opium. He was very exhausted. This summer, he quit at Physician She Zhen's clinic, No. 64 Ningbo Road, French Concession, Shanghai. He was injected with yellow honey and taken internal medicine every day. In half a month, the bad habit was completely removed. He felt like he was freed from shackles, but now his stomach disease has recurred. He has a poor appetite. Please give me a proven prescription and record it in the newspaper to benefit those with the same disease. (Asked by Zhang Qiutang)</p>
<p>(Answer) To treat stomach pain, the "Wei Bi Ling" powder issued by Shanghai Tongren Western Drugstore has a reliable and effective effect. Many patients have been completely cured. Each box sells for only one yuan.</p>
<p>Talk</p>
<h3>Widow's Abortion</h3>
<p>— Zinan</p>
<p>A news item in this newspaper went unnoticed a few days ago: "The widow Wang Lu, unable to bear her solitary life, engaged in a relationship with a distant uncle from the same clan. Conceiving a child, she was four months along and feared discovery. To protect her own interests, she pretended that her younger brother's wife was giving birth and needed help. With the agreement of her lover, she obtained an abortifacient from a certain midwife and ingested it to induce an abortion, resulting in internal injuries. She died despite medical treatment."</p>
<p>The reason this news went unnoticed, I suspect, boils down to the following two points: First, such incidents of women being killed by feudal society are commonplace, and Wang Lu's death is just a drop in the ocean. Second, the protagonist who died from abortion is a so-called "still charming" "middle-aged woman," not a "sweet sixteen" "unmarried maiden." Readers accustomed to yellow journalism and detailed "seduction" and "rape" news find this not "exciting" enough.</p>
<p>However, there is no reason to ignore the issue of this pitiable widow's abortion.</p>
<p>In the present era of rampant revivalist tendencies, in our peculiar capitalist-feudal society, the shackles of a woman's lifelong fidelity remain the greatest weapon of demons. Wang Lu, who grew up in a feudal society and lived in a feudal environment, naturally couldn't resist. (The problem here is not just whether she dared to resist, but whether she knew she should resist.) Therefore, caught between suppressing her instinctive desires and daring not openly challenge the old ethics, after the so-called "secret pregnancy," she had no choice but to eliminate the "evil root" that was "detrimental to her." Although she knew this was a great risk, to compromise with feudal society, she had to gamble with her life.</p>
<p>In this state, millions upon millions of women quietly and silently die like Wang Lu.</p>
<p>Amidst the silent, forced deaths of millions of women, the "big feet" (traditionalists) say, adultery by widows is still somewhat excusable, but abortion is unforgivable and must be severely punished!</p>
<p>Abortion is a sinful act, true! However, who wants to kill their own child? Even putting the child aside, who wants to risk their own life?</p>
<p>However, ignorant women who grew up in a feudal society and live in a feudal environment, under the control of feudal forces, cannot but engage in the "infanticide" they do not want to do, they cannot but take risks with their lives!</p>
<p>Yes, these ignorant, impulsive acts are the biggest reason for the "big feet" to argue plausibly: Could they not avoid abortion?</p>
<p>Avoiding abortion is highly desirable. However, a widow who grew up in a feudal society and lives in a feudal environment, if she knew the unreasonableness of the old ethics and had the courage to resist them, she would not have been locked up by the shackles of lifelong fidelity; she would have remarried long ago instead of remaining a widow.</p>
<p>Even after remarrying, it is still difficult to guarantee that she would not still have abortions or even infanticide due to the pressures of life.</p>
<p>Stop talking high-sounding "official language" and open your eyes to see what kind of society this is! — In this society, widows will not disappear, and after widows become pregnant, there will inevitably be "sinful" and "inhumane" abortions.</p>

<p>These groups of uncivilized people are discussing going to the rear to participate in the war. They hold the principle of following the wind, preparing to estimate the profits on both sides. (12)</p>
<h3>Sounds of Shanghai Vendors</h3>
<p>— Hancun</p>
<p>Mr. Zhou Zuoren obtained a very interesting book called "The Sounds of a Year's Goods," which describes the various selling sounds in Kyoto throughout the year. He wrote an excellent essay called "The Sounds of a Year's Goods." Later, he translated an article describing the selling sounds of London in the Darwin era, called "More Sounds of a Year's Goods." This translation, like the original creation, is equally outstanding.</p>
<p>Shanghai is China's largest commercial metropolis, and there are naturally more various selling sounds. Every morning, the streets are filled with the sounds of vegetable vendors. Most of these vendors are farmers from the suburbs, so they have a very heavy rustic accent. No matter how many years they have been selling vegetables, they cannot shake off the timidity of farmers. Even when arguing with buyers about scales and money, they always have a pitiful, begging tone and manner.</p>
<p>Because I usually sleep late, I wake up between eight and nine o'clock. Suddenly hearing a few voices selling vegetables, "Celery... Chicken greens...", I immediately feel a sense of humidity, as if it is raining outside. A vegetable vendor, carrying a load on his shoulders and wearing an old straw hat, has raindrops dripping from the brim of his hat and the vegetable load, but he slowly walks towards the gate far away.</p>
<p>Selling vegetables in the early morning is originally a "pleasant" (I say "pleasant") scene in ordinary small cities. In Shanghai, it only exists in older alleys because the vegetable markets have gradually increased, and the noisy sounds have already drowned out the rustic selling sounds that are now more and more tinged with humidity.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the sounds of miscellaneous goods vendors are prevalent in the alleys, from socks and shoes to candies and cigarettes. The vendors seem to be mostly from Ningbo and local people. They have no simplicity. Their calls are very mediocre, without any ups and downs, and they repeatedly shout pre-prepared rhyming seven-character phrases, which are really annoying. Not only that, the vendors always shout as they walk, but they put their goods in one place, and two people stand beside them, wearing duckbill hats and cigarettes in their ears, taking turns shouting. They are very patient, and their voices are loud, often shouting under my window for a quarter of an hour. It is precisely at the intersection of a horizontal alley and a vertical alley, so it has become a common target for these peddlers, who come and go, shouting in the same tone.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the soft setting sun shines, I light a cigarette, and turn over a book to read, just getting to the good part when suddenly these shouts with a gangster and swindler atmosphere arise, making it impossible for me not to run out.</p>
<p>The lunar calendar has been abolished, and people in the city no longer easily remember it. However, every month on the last day and the fifteenth of the lunar calendar, there are women coming to the streets to buy and sell "long ingots," which are prepared for people to use for sacrifices on the first and fifteenth days of the month. Especially at night, there are more of them. These are side jobs for farmers near the city, so the selling sounds are also the same, desolate and lonely, "Want long ingots... Want long ingots...!" When one hears it alone late at night, one often wants to cry!</p>
<p>Among the various selling sounds, the most praised is the sound of selling flowers because flowers are originally beautiful, and the people selling them are young girls. In Shanghai, there are also sales of flowers for vases, gardenias, and the like in the morning. The people selling them are indeed women, but the good power is not as good as that of "buying long ingots," able to shake my soul, because in my mind, there is a concept of buying flowers in the early morning in a small city. The morning mist has not yet dispersed, the sun is just shining on the highest building, a long alley, a flower girl, softly calling out, suddenly a window on the left side of the alley opens, a young maid with hanging braids, clearly stops her, and then a small basket and money are hung down from the window with thin colored ropes, the flower girl takes the money and puts the flowers in the basket, and when the flowers have reached the window, the window then closes. And that flower girl, slowly moving forward again, softly calling out to buy! As for Shanghai, the environment that can brew this kind of interest is still available, but even the gentle flower-selling sound does not arouse my fantasy.</p>
<p>Finally, I would also like to describe a sound, that is, the sound of selling children. In winter, women who are so poor that they have no way to survive, bring crying sobs late at night, shouting "Buy children, buy children." Because the people calling are not local, few people understand, so few people inquire, and this sound, I will never forget no matter where I go.</p>
<h3>Etiquette</h3>
<p>— Xiao Fei</p>
<p>I remember when I was a child, following my elders to weddings, funerals, and celebrations, just to join in the fun, watching and eating. I would just follow the etiquette and go along with the crowd. When I got older, things became strange. Socializing with unions was necessary, masks had to be put on, and pretentious acts had to be performed. Sometimes, I had to represent my elders or myself to deal with the world. In those situations, if I didn't understand etiquette, not only would I feel out of place, but others would also laugh at me with cold eyes, saying that the child didn't understand manners, wasn't fit to be a person, and even insulted my elders, saying that there was no family education! Although that wasn't the truth, or even a mere formality that was about to collapse. When the insidious forces were still lurking, no one dared to break this old cage. I despised and spat on this deceptive and formalistic matter, but imperceptibly, an evil black hand grabbed me into the old-fashioned trap. I knew that many people were living such deformed lives. If everyone didn't want to be braver and just wanted to glide through life uneventfully, it was a little scary to think about it. But unintentionally, I understood a little about the etiquette of weddings, funerals, and celebrations. That's not an experience to boast about, it's just a reference for me to attack them and prepare for another day of battle.</p>
<p>In my hometown, the custom is that families holding major events must pay for the guests' transportation to and from the event, based on the meaning of the word "invite," which is considered 合算 (economical/worth it). In families holding wakes or birthday celebrations, in addition to preparing feasts, they must also prepare pastries. In order to have transportation and pastries to fill their stomachs, a group of idle people wait for an opportunity to socialize. They get paid for the transportation and save on the pastries, regardless of whether they know the host or not. If there are three or five families in a day, they can even find a way to make some money. There are also people who rush to different events who are not idle. There, we see the true faces of those who help out or just hang around.</p>
<p>If it's a wake, it's not easy being a filial son. When a mourner comes, you have to return the courtesy, bowing for bowing, kneeling for kneeling. With so many relatives and friends, it's really tiring, not to mention that there are many other things that he has to do personally. Asking someone who is already mentally exhausted to do those insincere things is just malicious. Many similar customs are unreasonable. So-called etiquette actually suppresses people's true souls! But if someone wants to open that tightly closed black door, it will benefit the public. Some people will still put on a stern face and raise their fists. Of course, we are also strong with our fists. Resistance is necessary. As long as we use a little more strength, the enemy in front will not be able to withstand the attack. We don't want false etiquette; what we want is genuine emotion!</p>
<h3>Reading Cao Yu's Thunderstorm</h3>
<p>— Zhao Shen</p>
<p>Cao Yu's "Thunderstorm" was published in the first issue of the second volume of the Literary Quarterly. Recently, many places have staged this play, such as Tokyo, Beiping, and Wuhu, one after another. Recently, the Fudan Drama Society in Shanghai also staged "Thunderstorm."</p>
<p>This is a rare play. Not to mention the author's serious creative attitude and adherence to the three unities, the play's dark atmosphere, its depiction of fate, and its proof of heredity are all sufficient to be considered masterpieces of naturalism.</p>
<p>The structure is also very ingenious. He wanted to write about 蘧头 being electrocuted to death, but first wrote about the faulty wiring on the flower rack in the flower garden.</p>
<p>But he was afraid of revealing flaws, and deliberately wrote about the flood outside the servant's house, making the theatergoers unsure whether this 蘧头's ending would be electrocuted to death, or die by drowning. As a result, the drowning had no follow-up, but the electrocution had a sequel. If an ordinary writer were to write it, the flood would not have been added.</p>
<p>Zhou Chong in the play said a lot, containing hope for the future, with symbolic meaning, reminding people of Chekhov's "The Cherry Orchard."</p>
<p>In the second to last act, an old servant said a few words, like a pastor in Christianity. Such preaching instructions are often seen in Western plays. Doesn't Xu Zhimo's "Bian Kun Gang" also have a blind man playing the three-stringed fiddle?</p>
<p>Beginning and ending narrate old age, the middle is the main text, narrating youth events; using the method of the German Sturm novel "Immensee" in the drama is very novel, and I saw it for the first time.</p>
<h2>Page 21</h2>
<p>In short, the author of this script, if not widely read and thoroughly studied European drama, would never have written such a mature work. Finally, I wish the Fudan Wanfu performance success.</p>
<h3>The Story of Manaoag</h3>
<p>— Sun Na</p>
<p>(Sketches of Manila Life)</p>
<p>Two years ago, I was introduced by a friend from the provincial government to work as a third-class clerk in a small Chinese general merchandise store in the town of Manaoag. This town is near the sea, with a street of thirty or forty shops and a small cement market. Everything is dim and depressing. People drag their feet listlessly, while children hop and skip down the street, singing merrily.</p>
<p>Towards dusk, the street gradually becomes lively. Even the young men who had disappeared during the day, now appear in groups, with six-stringed guitars hanging on their chests, singing as they walk. They sing in mournful tones: "In that beautiful slumber, I dreamed of you, my love." In the Cantonese steamed bun shop in the street, one can often hear people loudly cursing and shouting, with spittle flying from their mouths. They often seem to be arguing because one side wants to buy on credit, while the other stubbornly refuses. At the same time, Old Coachman Futarok伯伯 appears in a vegetable shop (Note 1). He is already tipsy, leaning against the long counter, holding his wine glass high, tilting his head, and pouring it straight into his throat, until he has spent the last penny in his pocket, then reluctantly puts the glass on the counter, wipes his mouth on his sleeve, and slowly runs out of the shop.</p>
<p>This Old Futarok伯伯 is praised in the town as the most experienced coachman. It is said that at the age of sixteen, he went out with a skinny pony and a broken cart, doing his job. Now he is fifty-two years old, and in these thirty-six years, he has never interrupted his sacred career, except on the first Christmas of his marriage year, for the sake of God. In his family, there is a blind wife, a seventeen-year-old daughter, and a twelve-year-old son, but when people mention his beloved daughter!</p>
<p>Lena! He would flash his muddled eyes, but only for a moment, and then become sad: "She is an excellent girl, but poverty ruined her!…"</p>
<p>The head clerk in our store often behaved like this, but no one in the town liked her. She was a short, still childish little girl who would run to our store to mess around when the boss went for a nap. The head clerk had secretly told me that they had a relationship.</p>
<p>She would often, at a fixed time, like a ghost, take awkward steps, as light as smoke on the street, sometimes drifting over lightly, sometimes drifting away lightly, constantly wandering outside our store, until the head clerk winked at her and mouthed words to her, only then daring to stop in the distance, looking around: whether there were police or detectives; then she would lightly stride and run into our store. The head clerk would quickly stand up to greet her, and quietly instructed me a few words, before taking her into the storeroom. After an hour or so, they would come out again, Lena carrying her reward from the storeroom, and the head clerk would make a face at me.</p>
<p>Because I was faithful in keeping their thefts and licentious affairs secret, the head clerk repeatedly called me an honest clerk, and whenever the store closed, he would invite me to go to an ice cream parlor at the end of the street.</p>
<p>He would often hold his coffee cup high, tilt his head and pour half a cup into his throat, and then happily laugh loudly: "Speaking of being human, one must talk about friendship. For example, you and me: like those hypocritical fellows, today they say sweet words to you, and tomorrow they turn around and are different, wishing they could cut you in two with a knife, I look down on them…"</p>
<p>I nodded, and gently sipped from my coffee cup. Then he talked about Lena again.</p>
<p>"Lena, you say she's not on the right path? Then you're wrong. She is a thoroughly good woman, but poverty ruined her. As for her, the likes of that bastard Lao Jiusi would never see her good points." Speaking of Lao Jiusi, I remembered something. It was three or four months ago, Lena and the head clerk in his store had an affair. The old man said that she had stolen something from his storeroom, and sent an undercover to the district police station to send her in, and she was sent to jail, after which, she was accused of secretly selling prostitution and was imprisoned for two months before being released.</p>
<p>"You must know that when a person is so poor that there is no way to improve, they cannot care about face and reputation." The law is not suitable for hungry people, ah. Her father is old now, and has become confused, and cannot earn a living driving a carriage, and every member of their family needs bread to fill their bellies, so what should she do?…"</p>
<p>I nodded a little, and stretched my mouth and took a sip of coffee, then sadly sighed: "So she is always right"!</p>
<p>It was already late at night, and the streets were as quiet as death. The young men who had been holding six-stringed guitars in groups all night had also disappeared into the shadows on the street corner.</p>
<p>The head clerk slowly stood up and ran to the counter to settle the accounts, and we all came out.</p>
<p>Note 1: 菜仔店 (caizai dian) means a small sundry shop, which sells bread and alcohol.</p>
<p>Editor's Note: Mr. Zhao Jingshen's "Reading Cao Yu's Thunderstorm" was submitted too late yesterday and could not be published, so it is now in yesterday's "Film Talk" and "Arts Sea."</p>

<p>Opening Piece "Dream of the Red Chamber, Xiaoxiang Slumbering at Noon"</p>
<p>Quietly, there is no one in Xiaoxiang. Silently, the curtain falls near the window. The iron horse under the sign does not move. Lin, the lady, takes a nap, slightly drunk. Baoyu is. The dragon man is sick and trapped in the Yihong courtyard. Feeling depressed, mind lingering. Comes to visit Lin, the sister, in Xiaoxiang. He is. Lifting the bead curtain. Gently pushing with his hand. Gently calling the sister with his mouth. Says. Just finished lunch, how can you sleep? You are. Your delicate body cannot withstand the gentle breeze. If you are greedy for sleep, you are afraid of being unwell. Daiyu is. Her eyes are drowsy and her spirit is tired. Says. I haven't cleared last night's sleep debt. You know that. My whole body aches and pains. You are too unwelcome to disturb me. He is. Leaning on Daiyu's side. Smilingly, they share a pillow and talk. How laughable. Accustomed to fixing the sisters' makeup. Who knows. There are also traces of grease on the cheeks. How can old temperaments be changed in an instant. Lin, the lady, smiles and wipes with a handkerchief. A fragrance penetrates the nose. Sister, where does the fragrance come from? Daiyu says. This slave is a vulgar fragrance, how can it be as good as gold and jade. How can cold fragrance be matched with warm fragrance? Trusting in the cleverness, Baoyu already understands. Says, sister, your words are too sharp. I am. If I don't give you some power, you won't know. Reaching out to rub the diaphragm. Pitifully. Fragrant sweat and delicate breath come together. Begging for mercy. Don't argue evilly. In the future, elder brother will never dare. Annoying Baoyu keeps tangling. Saying. The conditions for surrender are inherently powerful. Sister's, I want to smell the fragrance of the sleeves once. Annoying Lin, the lady, is ashamed and hateful. He is. Covering her face. Seeming to sleep again. Silent. Ignoring. Intentionally neglecting to make her uneasy. Who knows. Baoyu's words are heavy. Daiyu is always deceived and makes the words round. Baoyu suppresses laughter and speaks smoothly. What to say. That Daiyu Lin of 維揚 has turned into a cave. The little louse has also turned into Miss Lin. Daiyu turns around and pinches him. Says. You shouldn't. Rotten tongue. Cursing and scolding this slave. Forcibly speaking of allusions. Suddenly hearing someone laughing outside the door. Ridiculing him. Poetic rhyme and allusions cannot be matched. When not used. How did you think of it.</p>

<h3>"Spring and Autumn in the Wind" Opens in Paris</h3>
<p>The Paris Grand Theater on Avenue Joffre will premiere Claudette Colbert's "Spring and Autumn in the Wind" starting today. The film was a sensation for a while, and the public has been eager to see it for a long time. The sadness of the plot will make many lovers cry together. Those who love to watch bitter love movies should not miss it.</p>
<h3>"Peach Blossom Dream" Follows Heroes of the Times for Public Screening</h3>
<p>The sound film "Peach Blossom Dream" directed by Du Yu of Shanghai Sound Film Company, led by Yin Mingzhu and participated by hundreds of famous Shanghai singers and dancers, is magnificent and bizarre, indescribable. It can be said that powder legs and dance ribbons fly together, and human faces share the same color as flower light. The implication is also extremely profound, and it is indeed a rare masterpiece. It will be publicly screened in Jincheng following the film Heroes of the Times.</p>
<h3>Superfluous Words on the Performance of "Thunderstorm"</h3>
<p>— Feng Hezi</p>
<p>After a considerable amount of painstaking effort, "Thunderstorm" finally lived up to the enthusiasm of several young art lovers, and struggled out of layers of difficulties to achieve the performance. This self-comfort should be able to gain the sympathy of those who love stage art, right?</p>
<p>This time we were fortunate to have Mr. Ouyang Yuqian as the director. Everyone who loves drama knows about Mr. Ouyang's past efforts and successes in directing stage plays; this time directing our so-called non-professional theater troupe, even if we achieve a bit of success in the performance, it cannot make up for the blood and sweat he has devoted in the past few months.</p>
<p>Everyone knows that it is difficult to direct a non-professional theater troupe, but Mr. Ouyang is serious and never allows us to be negligent during rehearsals. If an actor is slack during rehearsals and affects the entire atmosphere, he will say sternly: "I won't rehearse!" Therefore, no actor dared to neglect his duties, and we were deeply impressed by Mr. Ouyang's spirit.</p>
<p>We rehearsed for almost four months, which cannot be considered a short time. Unfortunately, a week before the scheduled performance, Mr. Wu Tieyi, who played Zhou Ping, had to return to the north because he received an urgent telegram that his mother was critically ill; fortunately, Mr. Gu Degang was found to replace him in a hurry, but the date of the performance had to be postponed to today as a result. It is naturally very hard for Mr. Gu to take on such an important role in such a short time, but with Mr. Gu's stage experience, he is more than qualified.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether our efforts have achieved that point, we have indeed done our best within our capabilities. We dare not be complacent about this, we are waiting for serious criticism in order to seek greater improvement!</p>
<h3>Silver Random Notes</h3>
<p>— Zhi Er</p>
<p>In view of the increasingly urgent situation in North China and the opposition of students in Beiping to "autonomy", it is heard that people in the Shanghai film industry will also issue a joint declaration to respond.</p>
<p>Some people predict: The so-called declaration of the film industry against the autonomy of North China may not be produced, because the film industry is the most disorganized. Judging from the memorial service for Nie Er, we can reflect on more than half of it. According to optimists: the matter concerns the survival of the nation, even if it is a mess, even if there is an excess of "tycoons", a declaration should have no problem. What exactly? Let's see the facts.</p>
<p>There is "Diao Gong Ban Hua, whose topic is: "Diao Ban Hua, who takes the most photos and has no achievements this year." in the Yisheng New Year's Eve issue. Therefore, I am very concerned about the "photo takers" because they have let down his "good intentions" too much.</p>
<p>Also, Miss Yuan Meiyun is not in this issue, which is very strange. Zhi Er is incompetent and intends to write "Yuan Meiyun, who is full of joy this year" instead.</p>
<p>Someone said: "Yuan Meiyun's joy of moving has been lost in the 'Unfinished Symphony'."</p>
<p>It is predicted that the cover of the Yisheng New Year's crazy issue will be a "sending roasted pig" two-color plate. (Zi said: Half believe and half doubt, also believe and also doubt.)</p>
<p>It is rumored that Miss Liang Baibo is currently directing "Romance of the Three Kingdoms." I don't know what it means. (Zi said: Is this an obscure consciousness? Or is it a cameraman's art lens?)</p>
