<h3>上海市推行識字敎育開始志感</h3>
<p>— 立</p>
<p>今日爲五月一日。爲世界歷史上劃一時代之國際勞動節。上海市識字敎育委員會卽以今日爲上海市推行識字敎育宣傳週開始之日。吾人於此。不禁重有感焉。</p>
<p>普嘗有人視國際勞動節爲紀念普遍人權之日。而以五月一日爲「人日。」其言曰「…從前的神話。要考究人形初具的日子。不起來。權把一月七日算了「人日。」做着紀念。現在才知道要人權普遍。才可以算得一個人類社會。因此大家思考惟有五月一日乃是紀念普遍人權的日子。把這日子算做「人日。」做了以後一段人類普遍人權的紀念日子恰才確當。」彼以紀念普遍人權之日爲「人日。」較之基於神話而紀念初具人形之「人日。」誠確當多矣。本此義以言。吾人苟能盡力推行識字敎育。使我國人人識字。而有達到肅淸文盲之一日。則此開始推行識字敎育之日。亦未始不可以定爲我國文化建議之「人日」也。</p>
<p>夫文字之產生。當由於人羣進化事實上之需要。旣因事實上之需要而產生文字矣。則此文字必爲人羣公用之工其。依常理而論必然人人識字。人人能應用此文字。不幸社會組織發生人權偏頗之現象。文字之使用。未能普及於全民。因有所謂文盲出現焉。旨者目不能視。爛於殘廢。文盲生理上雖無何等缺陷。要非健全之人。蓋彼等對於由文字傳佈之知識不能領受。其個人之福利有所犧牲無論已。社會之進化亦大受影響。是故推行識字敎育。不啻使殘廢之人回復健康。吾人以開始此項運動之日稱爲「人日。」誰曰不宜。</p>
<p>文盲之由來。旣源於人權偏頗之現象。今欲肅淸文盲。自非同時破除人權偏頗之現象不爲功。在二十世紀之新時代。人權偏頗之現象似無存在之餘地。况乎今茲市府所提倡之推行識字敎育。卽本於孫中山先生致力瞬民革命必須喚起民衆之遺敎。吾人於此。更當確信肅淸文盲一舉與人權普遍運動。其間實有深切之關係。而上海市誠字敎育委員會之推行識字敎育宣傳週。開始於紀念普遍人權之日。其意義實大可發人深省也。</p>
<h3>有吉建議一斑</h3>
<p>據四月二十五日東京報知新聞載稱、有吉公使爲確立對華具體政策起見、迭與廣田外相交換意見、業已完全一致、同時與岡田首相及林陸相會商、積極謀對華外交之再建、他方與民間實業家協議中日經濟提携之具體策、將國內諸情勢充分檢討後、預定六月歸任、又據朝日新聞云、有吉公使此次返國報吿對華政策之經過、披瀝自己所信、直陳意見、並促外務首腦部反省、彼謂南京政府自今春以來、已表明對日態度、改換數年來對日外交關係、但日本政府應乘此千載難逢之良機、十分自重、準備對華、故切望外務當局認識此點、免有輕卒之掋、今後訓令在華使館、應顧及大局、日本國內與論界、亦須認明不宣之點、俾可收對華政策之效果云、</p>

<h3>美高級軍官建議　增闢空軍根據地　地點則擬在加拿大附近加拿大認為違紳士恊定</h3>
<p>（華盛頓）大西洋與太平洋沿岸及阿拉斯加地方建造陸軍航空根據地六處之法案、前由衆議院陸軍委員會通過之後、尚凝加入一項、規定在美國大湖區域與加拿大接壞之處、建造強大航空根據地一處、曾由參謀次長季爾本向該委員會提出條陳、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）季爾本少將今日向國會報吿謂美國如於阿拉斯加開開强大之空軍根據地一處、則日本之外交政策可以大受影響、季氏曾任美國陸軍戰略長、據其所陳理由、「現在新轟炸機頗為進步、日法則向懼空中攻擊、故阿拉斯加如有一空軍根據地、吾人與日本之關係、及日本對於吾人之和平談話、將受何等影響、蓋可知矣」、季氏反對在阿留申羣島建築空軍根據地、因彼以爲該處之飛行環培殊為惡劣、惟大陸上則不然、故或可在荷蘭灣附近建築、且該處已被認爲可以建築阿立斯加軍港之地點云、此間觀察者稱、國會對於阿拉斯加未必卽刻有何舉動、因此次艦馬演習、已引起不少批評、一般主張和平之團體、皆以為此係對於日本之一種黷武表示、現在季氏旣有不同之主張、國會更將審慎進行、另一方面國務總理赫爾、亦亟頗與日本維持最友好之關係、故大槪赫爾亦將反對可以認爲捐及日本友誼之任何舉動云、（二十九日國民社員）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）美國吿級軍官季爾本少將今日向衆院軍事委員會提出之秘密條陳、引起美國與加拿大間之外交誤會、按加拿大素與美國最為親善、季氏之露骨主張並將引起日本之惡感、聞季氏建議在加拿大邊境附近開闢一航空根據地、以利橫跨大陸之航空、及戰鬥機起落之大規模設備、加拿大政府自聞季氏之議後、卽請美國政府寄閱季氏建議之全文、加拿大認此項陳述保不友善之恣態、與現在兩國禁止在美加邊境設防之紳士協定相違反云、聞國務總理赫爾將與加拿大表示同情、而反對在加拿大邊境設置航空根據地之建議、蓋加拿大方面並無不友善之形勢也、赫爾並願維持日美間之友誼、亦將反對足以引起日本嫉視之任何舉動、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<p>本雪爾文尼號艦　艦美國艦隊今日已向舊金山進發、空中有飛機四百架周圍盤旋、此係海軍大演習之第一回、今日淸晨由桑地哥及聖彼得二處軍港中開出者計有戰艦一百五十三艘、航空母艦四艘、亦由驅逐艦多艘掩護前進、甲板之上飛機往來不絕、至五月二日、艦隊將由舊金山出發、在太平洋大三角區中演　作戰、至六月十日為化、目前海軍當局對於「疑問第十六號」艦隊仍嚴守秘密、（二十九日國民電）</p>
<h3>英下院討論　德國造艦計劃　西門謂英正考慮對付</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英下院今日復開、在詢問時表示其對淤國際局勢之注意、其重要已可由此知之、下院請外相宣佈國際局勢、西門答稱、斯特里薩會議之情形、首相前已言之、而國聯行政院會議之結果、已詳載於報紙、俟星期四日辯論時、再詳言之云、某議員詢以德政府建造潛艇若干艘之計畫、外部有所知否、此種一再破壞相約之舉動、外相對之、擬採何種步驟、外相西門答詞簡略、僅謂德政府已有諭令建造二百五十噸潛艇十二艘之表示、但基爾潛艇學校已否復開、則尙未有表示云、前外相奧斯汀張伯倫問德政府何時向英政府作此表示、西門答稱、渠記得為四月二十五日、保守黨何伯特問政府將否設法使國聯注意德國一再破壞和約之舉動、又問英德海軍談話之籌備、是否尚擬進行西門答稱、因合法與否之問題、刻正在考慮中、故渠不能答此問話云、奧斯汀張伯倫向首相詢問星期四日辯論之手續、首相答稱、仍依照先行商諸反對黨之尋常方法云、工黨領袖藍斯堡聲稱、工黨以為辯論之初、政府必有所宣佈、渠希望辯論範團務求廣大云、首相答稱、政府對此請求、定可照辦云、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）關於德國建造潛艇重整海軍軍備一事、大約英國政府不久卽將提出抗議、本日西門外相在下議院中答覆某議員之問題、謂「德國政府係於四所二十八日前後宣布定造潛艇十二艘、每艘排水量二百五十噸、此種二次違反凡爾塞和約之行爲、引起法律上問題、政府現正加以研究」云、另一議員訽問政府、德國此舉、是否足以妨害未來英德海軍談話、西門答稱、此事現在政府考慮中云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德通知英　海軍會議展期　英國會明日有重要宣言</h3>
<p>（倫敦）英德海軍會議原定本星期內舉行、茲因德政府之請、已展緩至五月中間之後、屆時德元首希特勒將答覆國聯所通過斥責德國重置軍備之决議案、並宣佈德國之外交政策、英政府對德建築潛艇事、尙未有何决議、但星期四日下院辯論國防事宜時、定將有重要言論發表、如英德海軍談話他日實現、英國亦不欲在有關係國未成立一般恊定時遽自依允德國之海軍要求、（三十日路透電）</p>
<p>（倫敦）德國今日向英國提出關於英德海軍會議之建議、同時德國政府已完成其建造軍艦計劃、據此間官方所得消息、德國之建造計劃約有下列三項、</p>
<p>（一）立刻建造二百五十噸潛艇十二艘、該項潛艇能深入水中、至水底炸彈所遠不能及之處、並能行駛六千英里、無須添加燃料、</p>
<p>（二）開始建造三萬噸至三萬五千噸之戰艦五艘、其圖樣業已繪就、</p>
<p>（三）增建萬噸巡艦十六艘、較之英美海軍之巨型巡艦、速率更大、據德國當局向英國外相西門表示、德國所計劃之潛艇式樣殊為新穎、其目的蓋欲影饗海上之霸權、至於英德海軍會議之議程、已由德國駐英使館海軍參贊華斯納向英國政府提出、華氏已與海軍參謀長買飛爾爵士作長時間之會議、概述德國之計劃、據一般人解釋、德國今次建議之意義、蓋為希特勒元首欲以原定五月二日之會議稍緩數日舉、以便希氏能發表聲明、辯護其新定之海軍政策、觀察者以為希氏此舉、係欲解除英國方面之恐慌、並表示德國不擬如歐我前之與英國作海軍競爭、據目前之情勢觀之、希氏至五月中句、卽可開始會議、據華斯納氏所發表、德國方面之代表、將爲休斯德上將、啓特倫司令、李本特洛浦將軍、及華氏本身四人云、同時英國下院之辯論亦集中於德國之潛艇建造計劃、有人謂此項危險戰艦係直接對付英國云、外相西門則稱、外部現方研究此事、據非官塲消息、麥唐納首相口來正在籌備與法意官塲舉行會議、討論德國之破壞凡爾賽和約問題、觀察者以爲潛艇問題對於英國殊關重要、囚圖戰之時英國會受德國潛艇巨大損失也、德國之海軍計劃、對於英國當然較之法意尤感重要、惟三國早已表示、將來羅馬會議之時、對於德國之重整海軍將一致對付云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（華盛頓）據美國海軍部推測、德國建造潛艇後、英國勢必被迫增加海軍軍備、按倫敦海軍絛約中、本有「階梯式條欵」之規定、所謂「階梯式條欵」者，卽規定遇任何其他國家、增加海軍實力、而使華盛頓條約所造成之海軍均勢遭其破壞時、則簽約國得通知其他簽約國、增加其海軍噸數以保持原有之海軍均勢、一般人現信英國或將援引此項「階梯式條欵」、以增加其海軍噸數、英國增造新艦、固非美國之所慮、然日本如亦援引「階梯式條欵」、增造軍艦、以謀保持日英海軍三對五之比率、則美國所處地位、必不免大感困難、蓋美國海軍造船廠、現已竭其全部能力從事建造、政府卽欲另行添造新艦、亦爲勢所不能、反之、日本一部分造艦廠、則尚有充分餘裕、以接受新定單也、如萬一日本增造新艦、則美國惟有將海軍兵工廠、改爲戰時組織、例如久已停閉之波士頓造船廠、不妨重行開廠、建造新艦、但如採此種政策、則美國海軍部須顧及若干實際困難、而日本則僅就平時造艦能力、卽可添造新艦、兩者相較、美國不免相形見絀、美國海軍所以不無　慮者、職是故也、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<h3>德國各船廠　加緊製造新艦　潛艇六艘已造成</h3>
<p>（柏林）德國政府日前宣佈建造二百五十噸之潛水艇十一艘，此權係海軍新造艦程序中之一部分、此外尚須建造其他各項軍艦、德國各造船廠、如漢堡之勃拉姆伏斯廠·東普魯士之雪戈廠·及其爾港造般廠、工作均極形忙碌、此外當局並在基爾河下游、發展海上航空事業、最近在波羅的海沿岸自佛蘭斯堡至斯德丁一帶所停放之水面飛機、數目業已大增、（三十日哈瓦斯）</p>
<p>（倫敦）據每日報知新聞國外電訊主筆簽名之論文載稱、德國新潛艇十二艘中之六艘早已造成、且凖備開始操習云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）德國定造每艘重二百五十噸之潛艇十二艘、此間並不驚惶、數方面視此項潛艇過小、且爲數有限、不足擾害大西洋與地中海之法國主要商路、但足危害北海英吉利海峽與波羅的海之英國商業、法國反對德國片面否認凡爾賽和約、不因此稍懈、蓋德國今日旣興造小潛艇、他日卽可興造較大者也、英法對於潛艇之用途、態度互異、殊使對德局勢爲之錯綜、蓋法國視潛艇爲自衛之武器也、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<p>（羅馬）意大利日報今日登載一文、謂德國一九三五六年海軍程序、較上年增大三倍、共十萬噸、艦數亦多、遠超過和約所限定之數、日高出於英國海軍計劃之上、據巴黎訪員所得之消息、一九三五六年德國海軍程序爲戰門艦兩艘、各兩萬噸、巡艦兩艘各九千噸至一萬噸、又巡艦一艘六千噸、驅逐艦十六艘、各一千四百噸、小軍艦十艘各八百噸、而德國所欲造之潛艇、各在四百噸與五百噸之間者、將不止十二艘、該報又謂德國新戰艦將裝置十一寸砲九尊、其速度爲三十二海里、一九三八年前可造成、巡艦裝置七寸半日徑砲九尊、在今年五六月間起造、一九三七年底以前亦可造成、驅逐艦去年已在基爾建造四艘、另有五艘、現亦定造、德國已秘密製造狄塞爾引擎、現已造成、可供各重二百五十噸的潛艇十二艘之用、該報佔計德國海軍力量至一九三八年除潛艇外將有十六萬六千噸、（三十日路透電）</p>
<h3>法俄恊定商妥　雙方呈報政府審核</h3>
<p>（巴黎）午後外交部長賴伐附與蘇聯大使波丹金繼續磋商法俄互助公約問題自五時起至七時二十分始畢、當經擬定一種條文、將由賴伐爾提交明日國務會議審核、大約波丹金亦將徵求蘇聯政府之同意、賴氏將於國務會議散會後再與波氏會晤、一般人相信互助公約、可於星期三日舉行草簽、而賴氏可於下星期初首途赴俄云、（二十九日哈瓦斯電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法俄互援恊定將於今晨提出閣議、作最後之核定、並悉該協定於今晚或明日卽可草簽、法外長賴伐爾與俄大使波登金昨日長談後、已將條文措辭商定、俄大使同時亦已呈報莫斯科裁奪、據其內容、自動互援之原則已與國聯盟約及洛卡諾公約之條文不相衝突、惟簽約國仍保留其相當之自由决定之權、故所謂自動援助一點、亦有限制云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（巴黎）法外長賴伐爾今日與俄大使波丹金會商二小時半後、已將法我互助恊約詳欵商妥、其最後定稿明晨將提交內閣核議、預料或可於星期三日簽第一字該約內容、今尚未宣露、但就名義觀之、兩國遇某種情勢、當相援助、現信該約分兩部分、（一）請國聯行政院重申及增固國聯盟約第十條第十六條及第十七條、（二）規定法俄在此項條欵下互助之義務、（二十九日路透電）</p>
<h3>蘇俄陸軍次長　宣布德國軍力　攻法之時尙有餘力</h3>
<p>（莫斯科）德國能於數小時內調遣慶於法國之大軍進攻法國、且仍有餘力對付其他國家、此係法俄締結軍事協定前夕蘇俄陸軍副委員長都克季夫斯基今日陳述歐洲不安定時局後之驚人言論、都氏復稱、彼此言實以德國增加軍力後之可殼統計爲根據、至今年夏季、德國之軍力將與蘇俄相等、德國之正規軍將有八四九、〇〇〇人、此外尚有衝鋒隊邊防軍警察等秘密軍九〇〇〇、〇〇〇人、德國已有軍用飛機三七〇〇架、工廠現正延長工作時間、趕造飛機、每日可出十五架、都氏復論及德軍進攻法國之可能性稱、進攻之軍隊單位均能各自為戰、其參謀部幾與戰時乏參謀部相埒云、都氏列舉參加攻勢之軍力如下、（一）空軍、現在準備單獨作戰之飛機不下一千五百架、（二）汽車隊、馬達化軍隊一師團及機械化軍隊四混成旅、（三）騎兵、馬隊五師團、（四）步兵、第一軍團由汽車調遺約有十五萬人、計十五師團、爲謀行軍迅速起見、每師團附設輸送隊、各有客車六百五十輛、貨車六千七百輛、機器脚踏車一千二百輛、故德軍司令能將十五師團輸送至遠方絕無困難、數年內國社黨定能大規模發展攻勢軍隊、尤以空軍、汽車隊、及潛艇爲最、卽現在編成之軍隊、其實力已超過平時法國之全部陸軍矣云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<p>（莫斯科）蘇俄國防委員長伏洛希羅夫於五一節對紅軍將發表演說、略謂蘇俄實為世界革鄧之中堅、其名卽為各國勞工之戰號、蘇俄雖力求和平、然仍當抵禦任何國家之侵略、是則有賴於紅軍之實力、故執戈之士應各盡其天職以衛國云、（三十日國民電）</p>
<h3>德向英美借欵　購買原料重整軍備</h3>
<p>（巴黎）事業報載稱、德國因欲購買原料以爲重整軍備之用、亟需向外國商借鉅欵、「柏材某大銀行會伐該國政府與倫敦紐約兩處銀行相接洽、擬以德國人民所持外國證券爲抵押、而向之商借欵項、此項借欵若果成立、則德國活動債欵一三·○〇〇·〇〇〇·〇○〇馬克、得以整理、而國際貿易抵帳不足之欵九〇〇·〇○〇·○〇〇馬克、亦得所彌補、但紐約銀行業、對於此層加以否認、卽美國政府人士、亦謂依照强森法律任何國凡不償付對美值務者、卽不能在美國舉債、所望倫敦銀行亦能採取同樣態度、則可矣」云、（三十日哈九斯電）</p>

<h3>波蘭外交近況</h3>
<p>（波蘭通訊社）在某著名波記者所著之文中謂波蘭之外交政策已掃除昔日歐洲之舊觀念卽歐洲分爲治人國及被治國二大類、該記者更謂波法之外交政策實無大分別、波蘭之外交行動與羅馬及倫敦協定之精神實無分歧、其目的均在以國際間平等的原質期解除一切衝突、</p>
<p>波蘭對東歐公約之態度不足以代表波蘭對法乏態度、一部份法人以爲波蘭對東歐公約之態度、卽爲波蘭對法之態度、如謂東歐公約之目的在鞏固東歐和平、則波蘭•德國•蘇俄•巴爾幹諸國羅馬尼亞·以及法國均應加入、但事實上在波蘭未與鄰國間直接訂約前波蘭並未被邀參加討論也、</p>
<p>歐洲時局之新轉機、當波蘭與德俄之關係確定後歐洲之局勢遂大變更、昔日歐洲分爲東西二大區、波蘭不特與德俄訂定不侵犯條約更助波羅的海諸國與蘇俄訂立同樣之條約、關於蘇俄與羅馬尼亞之衝突波蘭亦曾助之解决、因波蘭有以上諸成功、對於東歐公約實無需要、在波蘭未與鄰國間訂定條約前此公約或有成功之可能、總之在事實上波蘭旣已與德俄訂有條約對於一切有危波籣已成功之工作之條約、當然絕無加入之必要、</p>
<p>波蘭應合作使德法之關係恢復常態、波蘭極希望能使波蘭之鄰國與第三者之關係恢復常態、尤以德法關係爲最重要、關於此點波蘭民衆有一致之見解、凡巴黎與華沙間所偶然發生之誤會均能解除於短時期中、</p>
<h3>波蘭之新憲法</h3>
<p>「波蘭通訊社」波蘭之國會現正在行使某種特別立法權卽重草波蘭之新憲法是也、上議院之憲法委員會對於一九三四年一月二十六日所採取之草案已於、一月十一日修正完竣如此修正案能於上議院之全體會議中通過者卽將傳送下院也、</p>
<p>新憲法之根本原質—對於選舉主義新憲法全部保存之、立法及自治機關自上議院下議院直至小鄉鎭中之市議院此後均須採取選舉制度而由人民選舉之、其選舉爲普遍的秘密的直接的平等的、</p>
<p>控制政府—控制政府權以及强劾權爲共和政體不可少之原質、在波蘭新憲法中乃保持此原質、下議院仍可控制政府但其權限略有限制耳、</p>
<p>人民自由增加—新憲法仍保障人民之自由、如集會自由·出版自由·住宅不得無故侵入·通信秘密·非法院不得處人民於罪等、所有華盛頓時法國大革命時以及廢除帝制時之一切民主共和等在新憲法中均已包含矣、</p>
<p>分權制度—新憲法對於政府各部之權限分界極明、卽關於行政立法以及司法各部是、在新憲法中更有所謂「國家乃人民之公共財產」此更足以維護共和主義者也、</p>
<p>總統之職權—新憲法對於總統之權限擬有增加、總統能委任內閣總理、有召集並解散國會之權、能委任最高法院院長及陸軍總司令更有權否决立法案、總統由二候選人中選舉之、一由前任總統指定之、一由上下院長內閣總理最高法院院院長及陸軍總司令及下院所選五十人民代表及上院所選二十二人民代表會合組織之選舉團選舉之、此二候選人選出後由人民投票决定之、如總統所指定之人與選舉團選出之人相同時則人民大選可不必舉行、</p>
<p>總統所爲行爲須由政府副署政府向國會負責、當政府機關不能機續工作時當政府與下院或其他機關發生衝突時總統有仲裁之權、換言之總統高於一切政府機關須為政府機關之調解人、對於一切糾紛有權解决之、</p>
<p>總統爲伸裁者—立法者希望此後對於一切糾紛能便於解决而使國內格外昇平、國家進步當更速、夫所以與總統此項特權者蓋總統乃人民所選舉者、人民對於總統當然有絕對之信仰、人民對之旣有絕對信仰則此項特權在共和國中當然需要、蓋如此則可無無效之仲裁矣、</p>
<p>總之根據已往數年之經騐深覺總統非由人民選舉之不可、總統非與內閣一體不可、總統非與以仲裁之特權不可、此外波蘭新憲法不特能打破世界共有之習俗更能實行與人民需要相符合之眞正共和名義、</p>

<p>留日係私事</p>
<p>李氏首謂、本人（李自稱）於二月下旬、以私事請假赴日、綜計留日約一月有餘、在日時、除料理私事外、並分訪日本朝野舊友、廣田外相曾數度訪晤、純作私人相互間之友誼道候、對中日兩國之國事、亦微談及、因本人係以私人資格赴日、非代表國家政府赴日有何使命、固一身甚淸適、無多牽慮處也、</p>

<p>蔣使不返國</p>

<p>抵閩留一週</p>
<p>返國抵閩後、計勾留一星期、因吾擔任閩省府顧問、故陳主席對閩省事務有所咨詢之處、常盡以桑梓所識者、貢獻陳主席、以盡身任顧問之微責、否則、豈非旣不顧、更汪問耶、</p>
<p>謁黃氏未定</p>

<p>市長指導</p>
<p>吳市長於指導婚禮進行畢事後、對結婚人有简單演說、首先說明我國社會對婚喪喜慶消費之大、一般社會竟有借債舉行之不合理情事、繼謂不莊嚴之婚禮、不得謂禮、而尤貴乎金錢與時間上之經濟、希望上海開風氣之先、使集團結婚得以普漏、最後對新娘叮嚀囑以三事、（一）結婚日勿散髮、（二）着禮鞋（勿着便鞋）、以國產黑緞者爲上選、（三）走路勿快、</p>

<h3>田徑賽訓練圖解（二）</h3>
<p>（江良規譯不許轉載）</p>
<p>（圖二）欲使姿勢準確運動員先得具一深刻之觀念、即標槍於脫手後、在空中之飛程、務須避免槍竿之震動、雖然、標槍多為堅靭之木料所製成、然欲避免震動確屬不易、此外如跑之距離及種類、各人因習慣不同而各異、依作者個人經騐論、騰步式實較交又步式為優、若將上述二法混合使用、亦屬可取、於騰步之先、加一交又步、此法可使運動員之注意力集中於最後之騰步、以維持身體之平衡、注全力於投擲、上圖示採用交又步式之姿勢、注意其右脚已移至左脚之前方、執槍之右臂、遂漸向後移動以備投擲</p>

<p>五一勞働節紀念特刊</p>
<h3>發刊詞</h3>
<p>— 陸京士</p>
<p>五一節的發生和經過，在歷史上巳是五十周年了。中國勞働協會剛遭五一節發生後的五十周年而宣佈成立，同時於這五一的五十周年的紀念日發行紀念特刋，其意義自然是更為濃厚而鉅大！</p>
<p>紀念五一節是國際普遍紀念的，不過，紀念的原則固是相同，可是，紀念的意義却有國別的地方性在；我們—中國的勞働者應該認淸時代的精神，握住中國本位的觀念，確定我們紀念五一勞働節的意義和使命。</p>
<p>紀念並不是一回虛幻的事，乃是一榕壯烈的舉動。我們紀念，必得要抱有正確的意義，同時必定要負起當前的使命。</p>
<p>中國勞働協會為欲指示出這紀念的正確的意義和當前鉅大的使命起見，爰有這紀念特刋的創發，裏面的文字，都是黨政界實際勞働運動的領導者，以及勞働界學術專家之經騐和思想的表現，在這裏光明地流露出今後中國勞動界應走的大道。簡言之，這短短的篇幅上面，不僅僅深刻地描摹出紀念的方法，並且進一步製定了今後中國本位的勞動運動的具體方案。</p>
<p>我們希望全國同胞們接受這一個方案，大家站在蔣委員長所提倡「勞働服務」的共同目標下，一致來促求民族解放運動的成功，勞働福利前途的進展。</p>
<h3>五一節</h3>
<p>— 程海峯</p>
<p>五一節又到臨了！</p>
<p>回溯四十九年前的今日，美國全國工人都停了工作，遊行示威，並齊口同聲的唱着：—</p>
<p>「我們從今以後，無論那一個工人，</p>
<p>不可再做八小時以上的工作！</p>
<p>工作八小時，敎育八小時，休息八小時」</p>
<p>歷史一幕有名的詩家谷慘劇，遂為了這次每日工作八小時的要求而發生，同時也替世界工人的解放，衝開了一條血路。</p>
<p>一八八九年第二國際在法京巴黎開成立大會，議决以五月一日為國際勞工紀念日。從此每年的五一節，各國工人遂都舉行紀念。</p>
<p>五一節的紀念，在中國還是一件晚近的事實。民國十三年上海工人舉行大規模慶祝五一節的時候，也唱着勞動八點鐘紀念歌，裏面有一段是：</p>
<p>「天造幸福給人用，晝夜二十四點鐘，三八制度情理公，做工也是八點鐘，敎育也是八點鐘，休息也是八點鐘，為衣食住來做工，不勞而食理不容。」</p>
<p>五一節的原始要求，是在减少工作時間，每日只做八小時。自第一個五一節以及到今日，其間經濟，社會，政治等等的變遷，不知發生了多少。這項要求，也隨了這項變遷而逐漸實現。但是多數國家，仍不肯實行，固然各國有各自的特殊環境，不容許他們如此，但是一個很大的原因，是在缺乏國際協定的拘束，他們都怕本國工作時間减少，而他國不减少，遂使在市塲上的競爭，要受影響。國際勞工組織的憲章上，也曾指出，「無論任何國家，倘若不採行合乎人道之保護勞工法律，則必因世界經濟競爭之結果，妨礙其他國家保護勞工政策之進行。」因此，國際勞工大會在第一次開會的時候，就制定了一個限制工業工人每日工作八小時，每週四十八小時的公約草案，以國際協定的方式，來在世界各國同時推行八小時的制度我。</p>
<p>我們從國際勞工大會以國際公約的方式來規定每日工作八小時制的一點看來，便知道在國際勞工組織沒有成立以前，工人所要求的，全憑本身在國內的示威與運動去獲取，自從國際勞工組織成立以後，工人一切的要求，可以在國際勞工大會提出，與政府及資方共同商討，制定一個國際公約，各國同時一律遵行。這樣一來，每個國家對於國內勞工狀况的改良，不致因他國未改良而停止。又一切改良的要求與方案，可以根據事實在大會從容討論，求得一個適當的對策，可不必再用示威的嚴重手段去促進實現，這是一個顯著的進步！要知國際勞工組織的日的，固在提高工人地位與改良工人生活，但是不主張用激烈的方式，而主張採用政資勞三方面合作的政策，這個政策，同是一樣為勞工謀福利，且同時還可避免種種無意義的犧牲與騷動。這種和平方式，我們在紀念五一節的時候，是應當要維護的！</p>
<p>自第一次國際勞工大會開會以來，（一九一九年）迄今巳十有六年，其間世界經濟社會的遞邅，不知發生了多少變化，不要說別的，就拿工作時間一點來說，前十六年所規定每日工作八小時，每週四十八小時的制度，今受經濟恐慌，技術進步與失業人數日增的打擊，巳有不能再事維持之勢，遂有每週工作四十小時制的產生。這個要求，將冉在今年的國際勞工大會（六月四日在日內瓦開幕）提出，想或能順利的解決。</p>
<p>四九年前，工友們用鮮血去換取每日工作八小時制，但結果尙不能十分圓滿，今則對於减少工作時間要求，不必再以犧牲去獲得，只須在國際勞工大會——一個世界工業會議——云爭取，而反可得到優良的效果，其中之變遷與難易，誠不以道里計。這種以和平手段與國際合作方式去爭取工友們的利益的方式，眞是一個極大的社會進步！因此我們在紀念五一節的時候，對於以和平手段與國際合作方式謀取勞工利益的國際勞工組織是應當要贊助的！</p>
<p>世界與國內經濟衰落，延長之久，可謂空前所未有，工友們之生活亦因之而受影響，因此工友們為本身之利益起見，對於一切世界與國內之經濟活動，不但要精細研究，還要來直接參加才好，藉以挽救不景氣的局面，而恢復繁榮。</p>
<p>在謀取勞工利益許多條件之中，健全工會基本組織，是一個很重要的條件，但是怎樣可以健全工會的基本組織呢？在許多方式之中，勞工敎育，是最重要的一個，為使工友們能够得到充分的敎育，必須他們多識字，現在北國政府正在努力於識字運動，掃除文盲的工作，工友們應給與政府種種助力，掃除勞工中的文盲，增加識字人數，以作實施勞工敎育的準備</p>
<p>根據上面所說的話，我們在紀念今年「五一節一的時候，工友們似應努力於下述幾點：</p>
<p>（一）贊助以會議方式謀取勞工利益之國際勞工組織，藉以促進社會公正而達維持世界與國內和平之目的。</p>
<p>（二）參加各種經濟活動，以挽救世界與國內之經濟衰落，藉以改良工友之工作狀况與生活，而達提高工人地位與促進經濟建設之目的。</p>
<p>（三）襄助政府辦理勞工識字運動，藉以實施勞工敎育，而達健全工會基本組織之目的。</p>
<h3>發達生產與勞資協調</h3>
<p>— （吳紹澍）</p>
<p>「從今以後，一個工人，工作八小時，休息八小時，敎育八小時」的歌聲，而今已播蕩整個的世界，勞苦的工人們，便隨着這激昂的歌聲，得到了一部份的解放。結果是產生了可歌可泣的「五一」勞働節，這還是西曆一八八六年的事。</p>
<p>本來，社會是有機體，人類要生存，就得勞働，不論勞心還是勞力，勞働總是神聖的。八小時制的要求，的確是勞働者應享的權利。</p>
<p>不過，今日的世界，各帝國主義者的經濟集國主義和政治集團主義，旣相互的排斥不已：同時，關稅壁壘，，通貨膨脹，廉價傾銷貨幣爭執等經濟政策具體的實施，更充分地表現出自私自利的猙獰面目。在這種反常與緊張的局面之下的勞働者，感於經濟恐慌的脅迫，本身生活是忐忑不安，終免不了呻吟在惡劣環境的支配下；而且，勞働者的失業高潮，漸漸地澎湃起來，更形成了經濟恐慌的尖銳化—緣最近的美國！這樣互為因果，愈使勞働者陷於厄運。</p>
<p>世界勞働界的環境是如此，中國呢？自然不能例外，豈獨不能例外，抑且變本加厲。這，除受了世界經濟恐慌的影響以外，自然是由於中國本身是列强資本勢力下的市塲；何况國內的天災人禍，又相繼沓來，農村破產，社會動亂，更使資本和企業能力薄弱的工業，不得不仰賴帝國主義的資本勢力為鼻息。本身營業旣衰落，工人待遇，當然談不上改良，遇有工人要求形勢較為嚴重時，便只有閉廠應付。結果，失業者只有一批一批的增加，糾紛迭起，無從解决，這還是產業界的現象；至於國有企業和其他工業，也莫不同在狂風怒濤中力圖掙扎。並這種環境支配下的中國勞働界，整個的生命前途，只有動搖和黯澹</p>
<p>然則怎樣來挽救這種危機呢？個人意見以為有下列兩點：</p>
<p>（一）積極的發展生產我國經濟落後，本國固有資本，極為衰頽，因此生產事業萎靡不振。</p>
<p>總理在民生主義中，便主張從積極方面，製造國家資本，來發展產業；並且先實行保護私人資本，再進而發展國家實業。因為私人企業的生產力，向來比國家生產力大，如果把私人資本集中，那麽，本國企業自然可以加速度的發展。這樣，本國貨品，才可以和帝國主義的貨品競爭，來開發工業，銷納我國過剩的勞力。不過生產事業的發達，必須利用機械，而這種大規模的機械生產事業，為私人所不能舉辦者，必須發展國家資本，來由國家經營。如此，一方面可以按照市塲需要的程度，而為適當的生產，免除私人經營種種無謂的消耗；同時，他方面以生產所得的利潤，歸諸公有，用為物質建設的資源，可以糾正分配不均的趨勢。且此種產業國營的結果，就是生產技術社會化，大規模的工業，尤且能够吸收大量的失業勞働者。所以要挽救中國勞働界的危機，首在發展生產，使我國生產事業，脫除列强資本勢力的束縛，，也來嘗不是針對世界經濟恐慌的一種藥劑。</p>
<p>（二）消極的勞資協調要使生產發展，財力的需要，固然是一個基本條件；而人力的協作，也是不可或少。因為勞資雙方，如果不互相壓迫，能够由相互了解，進而為充分的合作，這不獨在本身業務上可以得到發展，就是勞働者的待遇上，也可以逐漸改善。本來雇主與勞働者的衝突—共產黨所認為的階級　爭—原是社會進化過程中的一種病態，只應該糾正，不應該使之擴大，何况中國勞資雙方，根本並沒有形成階級對立呢？所應考慮的，只不過是一個勞資雙方利益的調和的問題罷了。</p>
<p>總理曾經說過：「……在資本家」方面可以多得出產，在工人一方面，也可以多得工錢，這是資本家和工人的利益相調和，不是相衝突。社會之所以有進化，是由於社會上大多數的經濟利益相調和，不是相衝突……」所以勞資協調，並不是使資本家壓迫工人，而是解决勞資雙方的生存問題。勞働界的危機，日趨迫切，勞動者的生活，也日益苦痛，我們要改良待遇，可是環境需要我們努力，我們得努力上面兩件事體—發達生產與勞資協調　來挽救勞動界的危機，改莠働勞者的生活。</p>
<h3>五一的時代意義</h3>
<p>— 朱學範</p>
<p>悲壯偉大的「五一」節又來臨了。</p>
<p>「五一」是全世界勞働羣眾鮮血洗禮的代價！牠不僅為全世界被壓迫者殺開了一條光明血路，並且也是建立人類和平最有力的一層保障！</p>
<p>歐美工人的為了求平等，求解放，經過無數次的壯烈流血，數十年的犧牲奮鬥，才獲得「工作八小時，敎育八小時，休息八小時」的三八制之實現，勞工的地位人格，始被一般人所重視，現在三八制差不多已被全世界所公認為最合理的原則，這不能不歸功於先烈個的英勇奮鬥所賜予。所以五一的光榮歷史與偉大意義，是不可磨滅而永遠值得吾人紀念歌頌的！尤其在現階段的中國，我們更不能不有一個準確的認識！</p>
<p>在目前，中國正遭受歷史上空前的嚴重國難。外有强鄰侵略，失地未復，內則匪禍連年，產業崩潰，而這些國難的由來，莫不為帝國主義的政治經濟侵略所造成；勞工羣衆因其自身直接間接處於帝國主義的鐵蹄之下，故所受苦痛尤為最烈！不但「三八制」沒有實現，而欲求最底限度的生活，也不能維持，失業無業，充滿全國，這顯然與歐美工人的生活狀况，截然不同。</p>
<p>特殊的環境，便决定了中國勞働運動特殊的趨向。</p>
<p>因此，中國勞動羣衆求解放的對象，應該是帝國主義而不是國內任何一階級，所採取的手段，不是階級鬥爭的自殺政策，而是本勞動服務精神增加民族生產力，以建設國家基礎，充實民族自衛力：同時我們要在最高領袖領導的復興民族運動之下，堅定信念，集中力量，緊提鐵拳，繼着先烈的血路，撲滅我們的當前敵人—帝國主義，以尋求民族的共同出路。</p>

<p>第一，本刊的編輯是經過本會理事會鄭重的决議，牠的旨趣，已經在發刋詞上面說了一些，要言之，這是我們第一次的嘗試，也是本會在後成立勞働學術界的一個貢獻，我們當然是最歡迎全國各界的批評和討論。</p>
<p>第二，原來的計劃預定在本報和晨報新聞報同時以一樣的內容發表的，可是承各作者不棄而紛紛惠作的結果，文字的額數，超出每報固定篇幅所能够容納的竟達二倍以上。因此，祗得採取分別登載的辦法，將吳解亞·張劍白·陳振鷺·王永盛·諶小岑·諸先生大作登在晨報，而新聞報上則發表吳開先。吳奐·孫曉樓·傅德衛·陳文彬諸先生的鴻作，限於篇幅而不得已出此的事，還求作者和讀者宥諒。</p>

<h3>拆息昨開二角</h3>
<p>毫洋漲跌不</p>

<h3>紐約股市呆而參差</h3>
<p>新豐洋行報告昨（二十九日紐約股市、起仆無定、呆而參差、一因銀價鬆落、二因美國鋼鐵社報告鋼鐵出產量减少百分之一·五而至百分之四三·一、三因羅斯福總統仍堅持取銷公用證券公司、至收盤前因最高法院對鐵路工人養老金案仍未宣判、引起鐵道股之買進、同時財部對白銀問題雖保守緘默、然投機家認白銀之展望仍極樂觀、市况致復回挺、小文易所股票債與債市俱少軒軒、全日成交六十五萬股、　將道瓊斯指數列左、</p>

<h3>紗花　交割後標紗徘徊</h3>
<p>紗市晨疲午堅、但市態又在盤旋之中、交割之後、多空均持觀　態度、故塲中買賣頗鮮、市盤愈乏變　、但多數意見、拋賣看小、因某君多頭、業已放棄、在五月期翻空、或有交貨之慮、觀察後步、某君交貨與否、為市價升降極大的然點、</p>
<p>近期紗遭壓迫</p>
<p>標紗前市開盤、各月市况又呈軟　之象、近日賣方壓迫尙力、跌六·七角、遠跌三·四·角、　拍至一、三盤、大孚代某公司扒空一千餘包、市氣忽轉堅挺、結果各月比上日牧盤跌一·二·角、惟本月跌五角、午後開般市情較堅、塲中交易寥寥、但檯面尙帶堅硬、結果各月比上午收盤價均漲一·二·三·角、查賣出裕大四百五十包、合興一千〇五十包、仁豐六百包、元一五面五十包、泰昌四百五十包、明德八百包、買進大孚一千九百五十包、新昌四百包、均昶一千一百包、長餘三百包、潤康一千二百包、益昶三百五十包、一日問最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>標花人氣良好</h3>
<p>棉市趨堅、但美印棉市均跌、而白銀回縮、標金穩靜、故人心良好、半數同業傾向做多、拉力甚强、惟現棉走銷尙屬冷落、因紗價不起之故、</p>
<p>外棉有加稅說</p>
<p>標花前市開盤、近月形勢甚弱、賣戶較衆、白銀雖大縮、然標金市價平平、美棉跌七磅音、印棉跌一一。三·羅比、故人心尙屬暗澹、賣方稍有加碼、但交易淸寂、市價變化較少、結果各月比上日收盤價跌五分至一角、惟八月漲一角、午後檯面忽然轉緊、籌碼　枯、據市塲上言、七月起外棉進口、又有加稅說、人心愈振而漲、結果各月比上午收盤價、均漲五分至一角、查賣出穗隆二千四百擔、明德一千三百擔、大昌成一千六百擔、源天一千擔、生源九百擔、信誠七百擔、潤康七百擔、買進大孚三千五百擔、大豐一千四百擔、元一一千五百擔、源興昌一千四百擔、賡豐一千擔長和一千四百擔、生源九百擔、長豐九百擔、一日間最高低價及收盤價如下、</p>

<h3>點滴</h3>
<p>— （陳蘊素）</p>
<p>或說中國的敎育、感化力最大，試看一般農村子弟，一經喝着學校水，就會立刻反應到自家爸爸媽媽的愚笨得可笑，起居飲食的簡陋得可憐，鷄豚狗彝的尿屎狼藉，耨地耘草的工作麻煩，在在想實現理想中的生活。</p>
<p>或說中國現行的敎育，純粹是採取一種鳥籠式的敎育，這話怎麽講，就是說一羣羣英氣勃發的靑年，一批批天眞活潑的學生，一經走上學校的門，自由卽行剝奪，不容你發揮什麼天才·和籠裏的鳥一般高飛不得，聽敎授們去瞎三話四·弄得奄奄無生氣。</p>
<h3>民國路巡禮</h3>
<p>— 無邊</p>
<p>華界和法租界交界的那條『民國路』、我們聽到這個路名時，會油然生起國家的觀念，同時，又會想像到這條路是何等的堂皇的呀；但是，我們如果經過那裏而稍稍注意地加以觀察，便會引起無限的慨歎和憐憫！因為那裏在映演的，完全是饑餓羣衆和勞苦階級的生活的形態。如再略事研究的話，又可找出社會和其他的癥結。</p>
<p>在那裏振興市面的中堅份子，首推那些百貨商塲，的確地是華洋百貨，雜然並陳：不過這裏的百貨，都是十九世紀的，並不是一九三六年式的，說老實些，便是所謂『舊貨攤』，那裏的舊貨攤，可以稱是鱗次櫛比。每個舊貨攤所陳列的物品，從文具部的自來水筆，家私部的一切器物，以及服裝部的衣帽鞋襪，與乎零星雜伴，色色俱備，他們攤主把低廉的代價收買進來，加上較厚的利益售給主顧。不過，那裏在買進售出時，絕對無有眞不二價的，討價和還價，恒會相差到一倍以上，然而交易十九是終於成功的。</p>
<p>除了舊貨攤以外，還有一種『舊貨擔』那規模尤其狹小了，是在一隻竹絲籃內開他的公司商店，舊貨擔買進售出的大宗貨品，是破舊的衣服和用具，大概舊貨攤摒諸階（舊貨攤都設階畔）外的，舊貨擔總還視同牛溲馬浡一般，儘堪當做他藥籠中的俊品。</p>
<p>在那裏，時時可以看見那些飢餓羣衆拿着東西來出賣到攤或担上去；也時時可見許多勞階級在選購各個的需要品。但你在他們的交易中，特別是出賣到攤或担上去的，要想見到一枚明晁晁的大銀倒，那眞如鳳毛麟角一般。</p>
<p>民國路上在映演的形態，不知可以象徵什麽？</p>
<h3>材門</h3>
<p>— 耘飱</p>
<p>我可要預先聲明的，這篇文字，不是迷信的推波助瀾，是一種風俗的寫實。</p>
<p>記得秋水軒尺牘有這樣一句，窮幕友向人告貸，「十叩柴扉九不開，」那並不是材門，而為柴草的門：又有一副門聯，「財門迎綠水，吉戶對靑山：」那不過形容門前景色，兼為自己祝福罷了：這種材門，却是棺材板做成的，並且要經了死人睏一大覺，然後纔有資格膺材門之選！這風俗在江蘇海門啟東兩縣，近海的士人，迄今猶流傳不衰，或問上海的包車夫，那可要說得頭頭是道了：至於怎樣處置死屍呢？買口瓦器的罎子，把屍骨骷髏裝進去，重行入葬；大抵貧窮細戶，做這賣棺材勾當，同時卻有個顚撲不破的規律，假使未曾繼續死人，以前的棺材，絕不出賣，頗合上「新陳代謝」的一句成語：裝置材門的人家，以資鎭壓厲鬼，包涵着驅兇避邪的神話。</p>
<p>士人們常生着一種「陰」病，（世稱肺癆），少男少女，未婚已婚，碰到一種寃孽，向病人纏擾不休，拚命進攻希求完成好事，病人雖不直言陳述家屬見到這般光景？就明白了大半，立刻設法安置材門：據說除了做材門，也有用着做病人的床板，它的副作用，更可以構建柵欄，豢養牲畜，比方棺材板搭成的猪圈，這一羣猪玀，便不會遭逢瘟疫疫：棺材板在海門啟東，眞有意想不到的效力，備上兩葉材門，大有「姜太公在此百無禁忌」之概，至於「飛熊鎭宅，」自然也在淘汰落伍之列了。</p>
<h3>自梳</h3>
<p>— 張慕良</p>
<p>日前見本欄載有闌刪君的媽姐二文，覺得頗有一說的價值。但，其中還有很多的事實，闌刪君沒有說得詳細：現在我所寫的「自梳」，就是把詳情說得透澈一點罷了。</p>
<p>自梳原來就是守貞的別名；這種風氣當然以廣東順德縣為最盛：廣東的娘姨，也以順德為特產。這些姑娘們在十七八歲的時候，結拜了許多小姊妹，實行自梳，大家擇定黃道吉日，由伊們的父母出來辦酒，於是遍邀親友隣舍，聲明伊的女兒自梳了。從自梳的日子起，便梳上了一個頭，因此自梳典禮便告閉幕</p>
<p>此外有錢的自梳者，以及娘姨的自梳者，常有桑間濮上之行：在自梳的娘姨中，所謂「近身」這類人物，專門只伏侍少爺房間裏，舖牀，摺被，和少奶奶梳頭等工作，工價很貴，起碼要七八元一月，普通以十數元者居多數：還有一件事值得向讀者報告的，就是這般娘姨的自梳者，因為專服侍少爺的緣故，往往容易與少爺發生戀愛起來：久而久之，竟然會變成姨奶奶了。</p>
<p>但，另有一種「磨鏡黨」却與自梳相似，利害非凡；如果某人為父母强逼着嫁了伊們黨裏的人，老實不客氣，伊們就要實行種種厲害的手腕了。當出嫁的女子，出門的那一天，這個「磨鏡黨」裏的姊妹們，就暗中用布將這出嫁的女子週身纏緊，身上滿揷花針，到了洞房之夜，不准新郎近身，一俟三朝回門，姊妹一定要騐看過，若是解散了，或與新郎交合了，伊們定要用種種方法，把這出嫁的女子弄死：若是眞的沒被解鬆的，那麽三朝回到娘家後再也不到夫家來了：伊們的父母情願賠錢給女壻，呌他另外娶一個小老婆，從此以後，除了年節以及臨死之外，决不會在夫家住一夜或走一躺；假使在夫家過宿，也是隔房各睡，在這情樣看來，男性眞要活守鰥了。</p>
<p>對於以上的事實，現在在廣東還是很盛行，所以我希望地方當局取締這種摧殘道德，傷風敗俗的行為才是！</p>
<h3>小西天</h3>
<p>— 張恨水著</p>
<p>第十二回　慚愧沒衣裳垂帷避客辛勤省膏火拂曉抄書</p>
<p>當時，我微微的向那校長，吐露了這一點意思。據他說，桌椅非常的缺乏，學生除了在敎堂讀書而外，沒有相當的地方。若是終日讓他們坐在敎室裏，那讀書的方法，又未免太舊了。不得已，只好讓他們在院子裏念。他這樣說了，我倒有些疑惑，難道眞的述桌椅都發生問題？若果然如此，這西北的敎育，也就難言之矣。因此我請了校長，陪着我在全校參觀了一下。其實，這裏還只有兩個敎室上課，另一個還是空的。只有一個土磚砌的講台而已。那兩個敎室，一個是高級學生上課的，裏面的長條桌子，桌面是木板的，桌子腿就改用土磚砌上的了。一個是低級學生上課的，桌椅雖十分破舊，却也和普通小學校裏用的桌椅差不多。只是這個課室，根本就可以不要。據他說，這校低級班的學生，統共只有五個人，一個是敎員的兒子，兩個是校長的兒子和姪兒子，僅僅另外兩個十歲的學生，是招考來的。然而還是他們的哥哥在高級班讀書，要不然，這兩個學生都不能够有。周有容道：一縣之大，難道找二三十名念書的孩子找不到？志前笑道：周縣長，你這一縣之大的大字，安置得好。正因為是大，而人口太少，一個村落，不過幾戶人家、要相隔十幾里。試問不上十歲的孩子，怎樣好來念書？這是一椿環境使然的事，直呌人沒有辦法。有了這層緣故，我們可以知道，學生都把年齡躭誤到很大，那不是隨便可以糾正過來的。（一九四）</p>

<p>小園藝</p>
<h3>日本的藝菊術</h3>
<p>— 吉雲</p>
<p>日本的盆栽花木，是很有名的。而對於藝菊，亦有相當研究。最近藝菊的時候到了，日本藝菊專家福地喜一郎曾將藝菊心得，公開發展。紫羅蘭盒主人亦喜藝菊，特譯之以供參考，海內藝菊家，想亦樂聞的。</p>
<p>菊花從揷芽到開花，大約經五僩月的時間，其他盆栽有需十年二十年的培養，所費心力，不可同日而語。因為他年年秋間開花，所以今年失敗了，便可作明年的殷鑑。在短期間中，就可使藝菊的平術，慢慢進步起來。</p>
<p>日本藝菊，在德川時代已很流行，品評會也設立得很早。武人商人所喜歡的菊花人像，是享保年間流傳出來，以小菊（如滿天星等）較大菊繁榮。大型菊花近來，流行最廣，東京有重陽會千秋會專植大菊，會員有三千人之多。中型菊發現於江戶時代，稱為「正菊」，是標準菊花。貴族福羽子爵大隈等，都是中菊黨的健將。現有秋香會的組織。小型菊專製懸崖的式樣，有長生會。每年十一月三日起在日比谷公園開菊花大會，各派團體，都有參加。</p>
<p>菊花種類之多，為世界園藝品之冠，種子何啻千萬。並且可以說沒有相同的菊花，因為花形花辦花葉，多少總有不同的地方。凡是新種如若不分新芽，任何人不能種出同樣的菊花來。因為新種層出不窮，所以藝菊者都盡力變化，便有特殊興趣。</p>
<p>大菊分闊管狀絲狀斗狀四種，中菊是普通最茂盛的肥後菊，小菊有文人菊山菊嵯峨菊等。中國的團形菊花是日本古時的一重山菊，今日重陽會等自負為名種的大型菊，是中日菊花的合種。中國菊花，輸人歐洲，繁殖最廣。至於十六瓣動章形的，是日本獨有的菊花。</p>
<p>藝菊的方法，先將芽揷入鹿沼土內，深約二寸置陰處二十日即着根。四寸花盆可種花一棵，六月初摘頸，枝芽可得三五枝。短的約三尺五寸，長的約六尺，最為適合。六月中用豆油滓水，每日兩回，至花前為止，以後只要灌以水肥足矣。九月十五見蕾，十月上旬破綻，十一月十日前後盛開。每日晨起灌水一次，白晝不能灌溉。以除蟲藥去蟲，半日一回。</p>
<p>菊花的調姿最為困難，風吹花亂，常見日光，水易乾燥，大約午後可置陽光之處。經騐不足者大約每人至多種五十盆而巳。</p>
<h3>御香縹緲錄</h3>
<p>— 淸德齡公主原著秦瘦鷗譯</p>
<p>尋常的富貴人家，每人每隔十天做一件新衣服，巳算是很闊綽的了，太后的新衣，却是平均每天一伴，或竟不止此數，豈不令人咋舌？不過裁製這些宮袍和繡服的縫工，却不是女性，而是男性的太監，他們畢竟還是先學會了縫工再做太監的呢，還是先做了太監再學會縫工的？那我可不曾推究過！祇知道他們的工技，也是優等中的最優等，决非外面的縫工所能比擬的。但他們的日常生活據說是和那些女性的藝工並不相同的，大概是比較苦一些。他們的工作雖然大部份也得由他們自已用心設計，可是太后偶然高興，要怎樣改動，他們就必須立卽照辦。在每一伴新衣服的毛樣沒有得到太后的核可以前，更不准隨便動手；不比那些製鞋的女工是可以自作主張的，打好了樣，卽可繡作起來。然而也就為這樣，鞋子的浪費更大！除却極少數深合太后尊意的幾雙之外，十分之八九，都像什麽古玩似的一行行地終年陳列在那龐大的鞋庫裏：到相當時期便棄去。要是宮袍和繡服也是這樣，只怕內庫裏的銀子更要完得快了！</p>
<p>接下去我還得講一講太后所穿的襪子。讀者中諒來不乏年歲較高的人，當可記得前二三十年時，那些婦女們足上所穿的是怎樣的一種襪子，太后所穿的，也大體相同。那襪統都是很短的，和現在盛行的短統襪差不多。（三〇四）</p>

<h3>論詩</h3>
<p>— 屈軼</p>
<p>讀到江寄萍先生底論詩一文，使我想起中學時代的一椿事。</p>
<p>那時候，我們底歷史敎員，是慈谿洪佛矢先生。據說洪先生是詩壇斵輪老手。同學問因少有向洪先生請敎詩之作法的。矮而且胖的洪先生一聽這話，便把繫在屁股和臍下的那條長袍上的汗巾提了「提，吸吸地笑出，搖着頭說：</p>
<p>『詩——詩是可以不必學的。詩有別腸，非關學也。古人也那麽說過。因為詩有詩的意境。詩的意境，可不是學得到的。全憑個人的天才和性靈。</p>
<p>「譬如說吧。唐詩裏有曲：「上山問童子，言師採藥去，只在此山中，雲深不知處。」那詩自有它渾然的意境。這意境是說破不得的。一說破，便覺無味了。但現在我們俗人，要是套那調調兒，做一首詩說：「門房間先生，言師上課去，只在此城中，校多不知處。」便不成其為詩了。」又如唐人詩裏，有「二十四橋明月夜，玉人何處敎吹簫。」改為「陸殿橋邊明月夜（因我們學校鄰近該橋，）學生何處彈風琴。使不成其為詩了。……</p>
<p>洪先生這麼說了，當然又洩出了幾聲低笑。但這一席幽默話對於我底印象可非常深切。因為我那時正在拼命讀杜詩，總覺得洪先生底話未必十分盡然。細繹洪先生那席話的主意。便是一切的現實的材料，是不准放在詩裏的。所謂詩底意境，即在於虛無飄渺之間，夢想迫懷之中。否則，便覺意境肅然。再明白點說，詩是需要更多量的想象的。江寄萍先生之所謂「發癡」，亦即想象作用之別名。不過江先生却更注重於技巧上的「發痴」而巳。</p>
<p>這一種對於詩的傳統的理解。確然到現在還存在一般詩人們心中。現代派的詩——所謂印象派詩，雖然多少裝點些現代都市底色情字眼，但在其手法與意境上，還是保留這種傳統的情調。——所謂意境上的發痴，手法上的」不格」。印象派的詩，居然在中國也能風行一時，在這里便可找到了歷史的社會根據。</p>
<p>但據我個人底經騐，讀到這些「發痴」的詩時，確然也能得到些微的喜悅。然而印象可不很深刻的。反之，有一種詩，開首讀時，覺得這並不是詩，可是一掩卷時，詩中各種印象都奔集腦間。有時，且能在現實社會中看到這首詩底眞實性。使人不覺脫口而叫：「怎麽眞有這樣一會事呀！」最好的例子，便是杜甫底北征。</p>
<p>北征底開頭，是：「皇帝二載秋，閏八月初吉，杜子將北征，蒼茫問家室。』這種平鋪直叙的句子，確不是有詩意的。可是越寫到後來，越來的有勁了。「况我墮胡塵，及歸盡華髮；經年至茆屋，妻子衣百結：慟哭松聲廻，悲泉共幽咽。平生所嬌兒，顏色白勝雪：見爺背面啼，垢膩脚不襪；牀前兩小女，補綻才過厀。海圖折波濤，舊繡移曲折，天吳及紫鳳，顚倒在短褐。…」這是如何生動眞實的一幅圖書。可是這里沒有發痴的地方，也沒有虛無飄渺的想頭。但給讀者的印象，却比任何詩都深刻。這就因作者並不想搬弄詞句，玩那一套巧妙的戲法，使你眼　撩亂；而肯老老實實地對你說幾句眞心話。</p>
<p>所以在我以為詩，不一定要有什麽詩意之類，主要還是眞實，正和其他文學一樣。不過在其表出的手法上，須用最簡勁的形式，撮叙現象的頂點。加以音樂的調子。沙汀底若干篇小說，本質上可說是散文詩。讀了他小說以後，我們可以想像今後的新詩，應向那一方面走。但首先還須打破一般人對於詩底傳統觀念。</p>
<h3>曲拾</h3>
<p>— 沃圃</p>
<p>「天淡雲閒」後記</p>
<p>前記「天淡雲閒」一條，引雍熙樂府卷六楊妃舞翠盤套，以為當自王伯成天寳遺事諸宮調出，今知其非是。該套曲蓋卽白仁甫唐明皇秋夜梧桐雨雜劇之第二折，宋金元諸宮調考未將其列入是對的。當時因雍熙樑楊妃舞翠盤之名，不疑係出雜劇；適元曲選又不在手邊，遂致失檢。所以前記中有些地方的推論，是錯誤而要改正的了。</p>
<p>從雍熙樂府以及譜曲的一類書中，去做天寳遺事的輯逸工作，對於甄別上，委實是不容易的。在元曲裏白仁甫還有一本唐明皇遊月宮，關漢卿有唐明皇哭香囊，庾天錫有楊太眞霓裳怨，楊太眞華淸宮二種，都是同一的題材；也許各書有收入的，但多未明白標示出來，極易混淆不辨。故現已輯出的，難免不尙有李代桃僵的情形也。</p>
<p>拿梧桐雨第二折和雍熙楊妃舞翠盤套參較起來，雍熙實少去「蔓靑菜」後「滿庭芳」「普天樂」二曲。而　字上的差異尤多，在這十歲支曲子裏面，怕有數十　光景，倘使一一　　的話，似過繁瑣。雍熙的時代在元曲選之前，我們自無寗說雍熙是較近元人眞象的。於是，這裏就見出臧晋叔改造潤色的手段和證據來了。大體雍熙中的汰詞訛字，都已是正，所加二曲，於文情關目上，也補足不少。像「啄木兒尾聲」中雍熙作「幾程兒捱徹雁門關」實不符入蜀的口氣，元曲選改成「幾程兒捱得過劍門關」便很妥當，這可算是點鐵成金的。「粉蝶兒」一支，梧桐雨則作：</p>
<p>「天淡雲閒，列長空數行征雁。御園中夏景初殘，柳添黃，荷减翠，秋蓮股瓣。坐近幽闌，噴淸香玉簪花綻。」</p>
<p>這比雍熙本有幾個字更同於長生殿裏驚變的一支了。洪昇老實是有所因襲了梧桐雨，（不過李林甫換了楊國忠）幷不關王伯成天寳遺事的帳。他見過天寳遺事與否？未敢論定。而在長生殿的自序裏，他開頭就說：</p>
<p>「余覽白樂天長恨耿及元人秋雨梧桐劇，輙作數日惡！」</p>
<p>他似乎是頗鄙薄梧桐雨的，這眞虧他好意思，正不免有點令人齒冷了。</p>

<p>只有這條忠心不二的棉絮，</p>
<p>如今它已破！有如裂開創傷的苦嘴哀求：</p>
<p>看你自己的面上增加了多少紋皺，</p>
<p>我沒有新陳代謝的機能，</p>
<p>那經得起無窮無盡的折磨？</p>

<h3>甲必丹先生　（下）</h3>
<p>— 黑嬰</p>
<p>甲必丹先生點着頭，沒有出聲。我倒給他一杯茶。抽着烟，他始終沒有對我說一句話。也不問老板什麼時候回來。一會兒他走了，招呼也不打一下，出了店門，走在街上便很快地在黑暗中消失了。</p>
<p>這一天不曉得什麽緣故，麻子老板娘怪高興地從樓上走下來，像是剛剛冲好凉，撲了一脖子爽身粉。她挨近我坐下來，問着：</p>
<p>『剛才來的是誰？」</p>
<p>『甲必丹先生。」我回答，望了望她。</p>
<p>『你們為什麼老是叫他甲必丹先生！他早不是甲必丹啦。』她開始說着，對着我，「五年前你可以呌他甲必丹的。那時節他開的店很發達，而且因為經營椰乾的緣故，很發了一筆財，所以嗬囒人很看上他，極力向他巴結。有一年恰好姓鄭的老甲必丹死了，他的兒子年紀輕，不孚衆望，政府馬上把甲必丹的帽子戴到這經營椰乾的商人頭上了。」</p>
<p>『後來呢？這厦門人的帽子怎麽又給人搶去了？』我急問着。</p>
<p>『那還不是一人吃人』的道理？這厦門人雖然很和善，他做了甲必丹以後，對於埠上的唐人實在再好也沒有了，但是，你知道嗬囒人為什麽要有甲必丹？他會讓甲必丹替唐人出力而不給政府做一點事嗎？那姓鄭的兒子就乘了這機會活動起來，大拍嗬囒人的馬屁。同時，去年椰乾的價格遭到空前的慘落，甲必丹先生的生意　　千丈，使他再也沒有法子不被嗬囒人唾棄了。』</p>
<p>『所以，他現在巳經不是什麽甲必丹先生了。』老板娘這樣下了她的結論。</p>
<p>我用兩隻手抱着膝，默默地坐在那裏，又想起父親的話來了。是的，這世界人有的時候也會吃人的呀！那個甲必丹先生吃了這個甲必丹先生就是很好的明證。我又想起那被吃了的甲必丹先生，那樣的瘦弱和永遠不曾有過笑臉地每天總得上店裏來一次，蘊藏在內心的痛苦眞是再深不過的了。……</p>
<p>一直到老板回來，時間巳經是關店的時候，我被『發呆了麼？還不關門呀！」那樣吆喝醒了，就開始將門板一塊一塊地搬出來，又一塊一塊地裝上了。</p>
<h3>棄</h3>
<p>— 千冬</p>
<p>小孩今天特別來得好玩，一醒來就咿咿啞啞說起話來。</p>
<p>「笑一笑吧！」妻子說。</p>
<p>小孩果然笑了，撅起嘴唇格格格地開聲笑了。</p>
<p>妻子也逗得笑起來，得意地高呌若：「再來一個！再來一個！」</p>
<p>立刻，妻子把臉陰沈下去，低聲地對我說道：「不要棄了他吧，小波，孩子是一天比一天好玩了，寗可我們自己苦一點吧！」</p>
<p>「我何嘗不是這麽想呢—」我討厭妻子愛說空話，所以我的聲音有些火了</p>
<p>妻子流着淚，把孩子抱得更緊一點，嗚咽地尖呌着：「我不肯！我不肯！討飯我也要討他大來！」</p>
<p>小孩還是咿咿啞啞說着自己的話。窗外的風咆哮地狂呌着。我沈默地不說一句話。</p>
<p>沈默，室內被沈默的空氣統治着。</p>
<p>快到中午的時候了。妻子顫抖地把小孩交給我，眼淚撲簌簌地從她的臉上落下來。我理會她的意思，我就把小孩接過來。小孩，一觸到我的雙手却又格格地笑起來了。</p>
<p>一路上我不時注意小孩的動作。不曉得是什麽綠故，今天的小孩是特別來得好玩呀，有時候他竟做諂媚的樣子，他彷佛已經知道了自己的前途啦。他的兩隻小眼睛總是驚邪地釘住我，恐怕他在責備我吧！</p>
<p>到了育嬰堂，我的心又突然地跳啦。門房呌出一位戴鏡子的姑娘來，她笑嘻嘻地呌我走進會客室，小心地把小孩接過去。她和氣地問道：「你為什麼要將小孩子抱到這裏來呢？」</p>
<p>「因為養不起他！」我說了這句話覺得身上很寒冷</p>
<p>「那末以後會不會懊悔呢？」</p>
<p>「不會的！」我直爽地回答。</p>
<p>我走了。這位姑娘向我點點頭，我的小孩轉過頭來用銳利的眼啾着我，路上的飛沙也猛烈地射着我，我是被壓榨得透不過氣來啦。</p>
<p>我一推開房門，妻子迅速地跳起來，眼睛像電炬一樣地探看我，她出神地注視我的前後。前後，沒有什麽，就只有我，我一個人！</p>
<p>她像是瘋狂了，蒼白色的臉綳得緊緊地，牙齒在格格地打戰着，淚珠像暴雨般滾着啦。</p>
<p>我沈默地走進房裏。這時侯，妻子巳經悠悠地哭出聲來，她準備作長時間的哭泣啦。我呆呆地凝望着天上的雲，雲在飄忽地狂飛；我也恍惚地聽到撞着窗子格格作聲的風，風在嘶聲地啞笑呢。</p>
<h3>巷尾</h3>
<h3>三天（一）</h3>
<p>— 羅洪</p>
<p>天好像開玩笑似的，只放了半天晴，又那麽陰暗了，漸漸兒陰暗更濃重一點，那一絲絲雨條子又從半空裏掛了下來。人們都嘆一口氣，生怕罪過，便把怨駡老天的話嚥到肚子裏，換上了一句「阿彌陀佛」。</p>
<p>「阿彌陀佛！看樣子老天是要滅盡我們窮人的！」大家都這麽說。</p>
<p>他們心上都浮起個黑影子，晃動着給老天滅盡時候的慘劇。可是話雖這麽說，大家都不敢也不願往這方面多想一想，因為誰都想活下去，誰都盼望老天爺發點慈悲：放幾天晴。</p>
<p>要是再這樣十天八天，田裏的稻不能割起，一定會茁了芽，沒有用的。今年夏天田裏正用到水，却乾了兩個多月，白天黑夜都要戽水，險些兒把人累死。這麽拚了命過來，總算稻禾沒給晒成乾草，結成狗尾巴那麼長的穗。大家正慶幸着還不至逃荒做難民，老天却又連續下着雨，把個秋收時候又弄糟了。</p>
<p>「天老爺眞是——又這麼下起雨來！」有發看見他弟弟從束邊冒雨走過來，便這麽說着，聽那聲音像是故意要使他弟弟聽見似的。可是他弟弟提着鐮刀，搬動着凸滿靑筋的小腿，直往屋子裏進去。於是有發也忙著收拾正在修補的麻布袋兒，滿身水珠地鑽進了屋裏。便站在門口把身子抖擻一下，兩隻手又交替着在左右肩膀上一拍，水珠子向四面飛了起來。他弟弟却伸直了勃子，一口啣着紫沙茶壺的嘴，喉核一上一下地動着，咕咕地響了好半天。接着他把茶壺放在檯子上，兩手抹着濕漉漉的頭髮。</p>
<p>有發向他弟弟看了幾眼，想說什麼話，把嘴張了一會，又看到門外去了。門外的天是陰沉的，那鉛塊一樣的烏雲，好像要跟着雨條子一起往地面壓了下來。他摸摸下巴上面三分來長的一大堆髪子，拖條板凳到門口，一邊坐下一邊說：</p>
<p>『有才，你怎麽樣，答應不答應？！』</p>
<p>「我早對你說過的，我不答應。」做弟弟的把頭髮上水跡抹乾以後，兩隻手在黑布夾襖上擦了一擦。</p>
<p>「我說，你就答應了吧，你媳婦到陸大爺家做奶媽，自然不會吃虧的，况且家裏少個人吃，又每月拿進工錢來，有什麽不上算的！」有發又膽怯又焦急地望着他的弟弟，一會兒又望望門外的雨條子，他自己也記不淸這個話已說過幾遍了。</p>

<h3>水災電報之功效</h3>
<p>— 楨</p>
<p>——黃災救濟會皓電之申謝——</p>
<p>黃河為患，自古已然，於今為烈，每當桃汎之期，若不事先預防，一旦河堤橫決，漂蕩千里，其生命財產之損失，殆不可以數計。救濟之道，治標與治本兼重，而通信上之迅捷，尤為急務，良以河流甚速，防汎機關衆多，苟不藉通信上之便利、未有不債事者也。</p>
<p>交通部對於黃河水利，素為注視，曾規定報告水位流量電報號碼，並聞於去年七月，通令濟南開封西安等處電報局，遇有黃河水利委員會拍發報汎電報，應立時予以免費拍發。又大汎期內各河盛漲，亦時有在夜間老，此項電報，至關重要，如過各報汎站夜間發電，務必於夜間立時發出，收報局應隨收隨送，至必要時，得延長各局之工作時間云。</p>
<p>至於振務電報之傳遞次序，照例列於尋常電報之後，但此次黃河水災救濟委員會主辦貫台堵口補救工程，該會所發之電報，各電局以事關救災，不容忽視，均能以最敏捷方法於最短時間內拍發，故該會所得消息，非常靈敏，用能迅集大功，消患於無形。茲探得黃河水災救濟委員會致交通部朱部長一電，盛稱各電局不分畛域協助進行之功，爰將該電抄錄如下，足見電報功效之一班也</p>
<p>「南京交通部朱部長勛鑒：本會工振組主辦貫台堵口補救工程，幸於本月十一日慶告合龍。此次工事之緊張，時機之危迫，關於傳遞消息，電訉往還，胥賴貴部於各電台不分畛域，恊助進行，用能於短期內，迅赴事功，拯彼災黎，免淪浩刧，急公好義，敬佩同深，謹電布謝，敬希鋻照。黃河水災救濟委員會叩皓。」</p>
<h3>改良電話收費辦法</h3>
<p>— 淸華</p>
<p>交通部各電話局對於向用戶收取話費，向來各自為政，並無統一辦法，因此每一電話局雖用了二三十個收費員向用戶收費，但是成績還是不好，欠費累累。其中綠故，雖是各用戶不履行應盡的義務！照章付費，但是沒有一定收費的日期和辦法，也是一個重要原因。交通部為切實整頓收費，並便利用戶繳費起見，特新訂「電話局向用戶收費辦法」一種，其要點如下：</p>
<p>（一）電話局視當地情形，將所在地劃分為若干區，於每月一日至十日內，分別規定一日為向某區用戶收費之日期，此項分區之界綫及區內之街名，由電話局登報公布，並印入電話號簿內。</p>
<p>（二）每屆收費之日，由電話局派佩有證章之收費員，持預先塡就並蓋有局印之電話局正式收據，向用戶收費。如用戶立卽付費，卽用收費員在收據上加蓋本人私章，交用戶收執。如用戶因外出或其他原因而不能當日付費，則由收費員留交用「催費通知單」一張，此單分三聯，一聯為催費通知，一聯為臨時收據，一聯為收費通知。用戶接到此項三聯單後，應於五日內持單往電話局或就近電報收發處（各郵局內均附設）繳費，由經收人在臨時收據一聯上蓋章掣交用戶，其餘兩聯由局處留下。</p>
<p>（三）電話局本局收到用戶繳費，或接到電報收發處之收費通知後，立卽將正式收據面交或寄至用戶，用戶如向電報收發處繳費後，七日內尚未接到電話局寄來正式收據或接到電話局電話催費時，可用電話通知電話局以便查究。</p>
<p>（四）用戶如於接到收費員之催費通知單後，五日內仍不繳費，電話局卽於期滿後第三日用電話向用戶催收一次，如用戶仍不於當日向局處付費，電話局卽於期滿後第五日予以停止通話，如停話後逾七日仍未繳淸，卽予銷號拆機，所欠電話月租費及長途話費卽在押機費內扣除。上項辦法係仿照首都電廠收取電費法而規定，現已定自五月一日起實行，</p>
<p>實行後有四種利益，（一）用戶方面對於電話費有一定收取的日期，可以準時預備，（二）用如如當日不能將話費交與收費員，可於五日內就近交與電報收發處，不必一定至電話局繳費，省去跋涉之勞。（三）電話局方面準期收費，不必派收費員再三向用戶催收，可以省去人手，（四）電話局的電話欠費問題可以解决，收入有保障，業務可更加改善發展。以上四種利益，用戶與電話各佔其二，所以此項辦法之實行，可稱一舉兩得！</p>
<p>末了，記者希望各用戶對於每月應盡之義務—卽繳付月租費，務必準時履行，藉以減少電話局方面催費手續，在此話局力謀服務公衆（如添設詢問台）的時候，各用戶旣儘量享受各種權利，對於每月區區電話月租費，希望以合作之精神按時繳付，勿予拖欠，一方面表示報酬話局服務之精神，同時亦卽保障自己應享之權利也！</p>
<h3>非法招收電報的取締</h3>
<p>— 開第</p>
<p>按照電信條例，電報事業除了經交通部委任辦理或特許核準之外，無論在何機關或個人不能私自經營。近年來因為無綫電的發達，社會上有少數份子，常有私自設立電臺，秘密收發電報，貪國個人私利，妨害國營事業。真是目無法紀！經交通部嚴厲取締後，此風稍敢；如天津永立永增合兩銀號私設電臺，業經破獲法辦，本刊曾有詳細紀戰。那知私設電臺正在取締時期，而在廈門方面，又發現了一件非法招收戰報的案件。意不但防害電報收入，並且對謚華南方面的出國僑胞，很有不利的影響！現特將本案經過的始末，宣佈出來，俾一般奸商知所警惕，出國僑胞，不要受其愚弄才是。</p>
<p>查在厦門方面，每月出國前往南洋羣島經商的我國僑胞，為數非常之多，但是因為馬尼拉方面對於外國人民的入口手續，辦得非常周密，稍有不合，就有被拒登岸，遣送回國的危險。所以僑胞，在出國之前，除了委託護照館辦理護照及各旅社辦理船票之外，必須拍電至馬尼拉方面的親友，代辦保接登岸手續。交通部為便利出國僑胞通信起見，特在厦門方面，開放一條厦菲無綫電路，與馬尼拉直接通報，迅速準確，每月僑胞發電甚多，莫不稱便。這種通知親友電報，或由各僑胞委託護照館或旅社代為拍發，或由各僑胞自己送往厦門電臺拍發。乃查近三四月來，僑胞雖仍源源不斷的出國，而這種電報。忽然逐月减少，經厦門電臺多方偵察研究，始發覺有華菲合作社及太古鈿記行兩家的職員，竟異想天開，利用交通部頒佈的國際夜間書信電報規則，向各旅社的僑胞，招收此種電報，每人收取報費三元或五元不等，然後將招收的各電，合為一電，湊滿二十五字以上（因夜信電報規定每電以二十五字為最少限度），向厦門電臺作為夜信電報拍發，從中漁利。現在且將這種招收電報，對於出國僑胞的不利之點，分述如下：</p>
<p>由厦門拍發馬尼拉的電報，價目可分三種，尋常電每字一元五角，遲緩電每字七角五分，夜信電每字五角。僑胞發寄通知親友辦理入口登岸手續的電報，大多數均按遲緩電報拍發。每電平均以六字計算，報費不過四元五角，而華菲合作社和太古鈿記行非法招收的電報，每人也要收取四元或五元，此在僑胞方面所省的報費有限，然而在電政收入方面，却受到很大的損失。這種非法商收的混合夜信電報，係由各該社拍致馬尼拉方面預先約定的人，再分別轉知各護照館或僑胞的親友，於輸船抵埠時，辦理保接登岸各項手續，如此輾轉通知，很容易發生種種錯誤與危險，所以出國儒胞，到達彼岸，常因這種夜信電報送達過遲，（夜信電報，因價目特別低廉，投送時間，照章規定須延擱二十四小時以後，方能投送），或者對方通知未週，保接無人，被拒登岸，派送回國的情事發生。奉勸各位僑胞，嗣後如要發寄此項電報，請直接到厦門電局或電臺拍發，迅捷正確，决不失事！</p>
<p>交通部因鑒於這種非法招收電報，非但妨害電局信譽，影響營業收入，並且對於僑務政策，也有極大關係，現已令飭廈門電報局及無綫電臺予以嚴厲取締，一方面向各該社正式警告，應立卽停止這種私自招收電報的不法行為，一方面飭厦局厦臺，嗣後過有此種意義不明的混合電報，一律按照綴字語計費，以杜取巧，否則，拒絕收拍，再一方面並函請厦門僑務會通告各出國僑胞注意，切勿再受各該社愚弄。想經如此嚴厲取締之後，不法之徒，可以從此歛跡了！</p>
<h3>船舶電報講話</h3>
<p>— 中明</p>
<p>—聯絡水陸通信，保障航行安全—</p>
<p>在無綫電報未發明以前，住居在陸地上的人，欲與航行在海洋中的船舶互通信息，是不可能的事。但自無綫電通信術成功之後，此事非但變為可能，而且發展得很普遍迅速。到了現在，噸數較大的輪舶，幾乎都裝置無紙電收發報機，以便航行時與陸上通信。這種設備，非特解决了水陸間的通信問題，而且為航行安全上加上一重極好的保障。非僅為了船舶自身通信問題的解决，同時也為了搭客求通信上的便利。所以，在航行中的搭客，如想與陸上親友通信，或是陸上親友，想與航行中的搭客通信或出差人員在航行中，想要報告行程或所見所聞之事，於其政府機關，或政府機關有緊要公事，必須與正在航程中的出差人員通信，都可以利用船舶無綫電報。雖是遠隔重洋，船踪無定，祗要裝有無綫電的設備，隨時可以通信，决無「飄泊」之苦！至於說到「保障航行安全」一層，有兩種方面，其一是船舶在航行中遇有火警，觸礁，颺風，盜匪等危險時，可以發電求援，同時也可與陸上觀象機關聯絡，隨時藉無綫電得到氣象的警報而預事戒備。其二便是報告行程以及協助治安。報告行程是船舶電台主要的任務。而恊助治安，也是一種利用船舶電報的方法，譬如，陸上公安機關緝捕罪犯未獲，認為巳搭輸逃避出口時，便可拍發船舶電報給某船船主，說明狀貌，年歲，口音等等請其注意查視，船主接到此項電報後，對於有此項嫌疑者，便可暗中加以監守，到岸時送交當地公安機關或法院。由此看來，船舶無綫電報確是一種極重要極便利的水陸通信利器。交通部對於船舶無綫電報收費辦法，訂有專則，足見當局對於船舶電報注意之一斑。</p>
<p>船舶無綫電報因業務性質之特殊，通信手續之增繁，其報費與陸上通信不同，而適用特別業務亦有限制。船舶報分為國內與國際兩種，國內者按國幣收費，華文明語每字銀元二角五分，華文暗語或洋文每字銀元五角，洋文暗語電報，照全價收費，不適用國際暗語電報减成收費辦法，所有收報人姓名職銜船名海岸台名或住址，其寫法與普通電報相同，惟均須按字計費，不適用收報地名與收報人姓名住址在十五字以內作五字計算之規定，例如：</p>
<p>（一）丁子鴻二十號官船　新銘烟台</p>
<p>（二）Captain　Wangshihlee　SS　Haiyuan　Tsiagtanradio</p>
<p>第一例應作十二字計算，第二例應作五字計算。至於國際船舶電報，因經轄路由之複雜，共分為十一類收費，均以法郎計算，每字報費自九十生丁起至二法郎十五生丁不等，其詳細辦法，交部訂有國際船舶電報價目表，可資索閱。講到國內與國際船舶電報的分別，交通部頒佈的船舶無綫電報收費規則第三第十一條有下列的規定：</p>
<p>「第三條：曾經交通部註冊並發給船舶無綫電台執照之船舶，與國內各處往來之電報，經由交通部所轄各海岸電台轉遞者，為國內船舶電報。船舶電報之不合於前項規定者，為國際船舶電報。」</p>
<p>「第十一條：本規則第三條第一項所規定之船舶，其與國內各處往來之電報，欲適用國內船舶電報價目之規定者，應經由其監督機關，呈請交通部核准備案，再由交通部通知各海岸電台及電報局方為有效。」至船舶電報適用之特別業務，以左六種為限：</p>
<p>（甲）預付回報費（乙）校對（丙）分送（丁）送妥通知（祗由海岸電台將電報傳遞於船舶電台之日期時間通知原發報人）（戊）專送（祇適用於由船舶發往陸地之電報）（己）納費業務公電</p>
<p>前項特別業務之附加費，如係國內船舶電報，照國內電報例收費，國際船舶電報，照國際電報例收費。他如船舶電台與經轉機關攤分報費辦法，該項規則附表內，也有明白規定，從略。</p>
<p>上述辦法，係交通部新近制定公布，以前所有船舶電報，都按國際報價目計費，並無國內國際之分，交通部鑒於此種辦法，民衆負擔過鉅，於是有國內船舶電報之添設，報費，比前减輕多多，今後船舶電報業務的發展，可操左券</p>
<p>記者鑒於船舶電台的重要性，同時佩服交部整理船舶電報收費的熱心，不禁生出十二分的希望；希望在我國境內航行的船舶—無論國營民營—儘量的裝設無綫電台。以策航行的安全。同時按照船舶電報收費規則的規定，呈請交通部註冊領照，以求通信的便利。</p>
<h3>關於交際電報種種</h3>
<p>— 記者</p>
<p>（一）交際電報抄費　國內分送電報計算份數，概照所有收報人姓名住址之數目計算，每份在五十字以內者，收銀二角，逾此照加，不滿此者亦作五十字計算。此項辦法，自本年三月一日起實行而交際電報抄費，自去年十二月有日起，改為每份五十字銀元一角，不滿五十字者亦作五十字論，逾此照加。是先於常尋電减價實行矣。</p>
<p>（二）交際電報郵寄　尋常電報，以投遞迅速為主，故發往未設電局各村鎭之報，例須收專力費，專差投送。但交際電報時間性比較稍寬，母須專差投送，僅由收報局台照郵轉電報辦法，交郵遞寄巳足。收發報人不必付專力費，而交際電及於鄕村矣。</p>
<p>（三）交際電報計字　查交際電之收報人姓名住址，雖可適用省費新章，但按照交際電規則，每電至少以二十字起碼，故照省新章計算字數之交際電，如不滿起碼字數者，其計算字數，應照起碼字數計算。電底字數欄內所列計費字數，亦應塡列起碼字數。例如二十五字之交際電，其住址照省費新章計算後，全電僅十八字，但照章應按二十字收費，故該電電底字數欄內所列計費及實在字數，應為二十二十五字。</p>
<p>（四）交際電報範圍　交通部創設交際電報，原為推廣業務，藉以引起國人發電之與趣，故價目特別低廉，電局雖受人工材料損失，亦所不計。此項電報之範圍，自四月一日起，擴展如下：（一）關於慶賀年節，結婚，添嗣，壽誕，紀念，升學，畢業，出洋，開張，遷居，考取，升遷，就職，發明，求功，勝利，典禮得獎事項、（二）關於弔唁，喪亡，殯葬事項，（三）關於慰問，疾病，災荒，失愼，受傷，被盜，失敗事項，及（四）表示歡迎或歡送之電報，及其答謝之復電，均準列作交際電臺是交際電實為人羣酬酢最廣之用途。惟以用途旣廣，發報人所書電文，往往有字義欠明不合定章者，殊有背於創設交際電之原意。聞交通部巳飭各電局人員切實注意，嗣後如有交際電電文，不合定章者，應婉勸告發報人的數字句、然後接收云。</p>
<h3>國際電臺電傳機及電話收發概況</h3>
<p>— 沈元洪</p>
<p>查交通部近來對於電報效率，日有改進，沈君所述之電傳機，京·津·滬·漢·平·青各大局，巳先後裝設。至電話收發電報，各局均早巳實行，非僅國際電臺然也。惟國際電臺人員，富於辦事精神。各項設備，都能使人滿意，值得國人贊許，沈君此文，蓋實錄也。　編者職</p>
<p>輓近科學昌明，人事增繁，電報事業，日益發達，由有綫電而入於無綫電，由國內通報而進至國際間往返，於是遠隔重洋，秒迢千萬里，而能通報於分毫之間，宛如對晤者，無綫電之功也。雖然，電報通訊，如此　速，對於派送，苟不力求敏捷，仍不免功虧一簣。國際電台有鑒於此，為謀業和田發展起見，除加僱精幹報差，增進送報效率外，特開電話及電傳機收費專室，日夜主司其事，內部職員，皆經甄別遴選，學職夏長，性情和善之士充之，凡報務較繁而欲更求迅速遞送者，均可聲請特約，將電文先用電話或電傳機傳遞之。茲將該項電話及電傳機收發情形，分別申言之：</p>
<p>（一）電話收發　先由商行聲請特約，將名號·住址·掛號名稱等依式塡報，並設定一種暗號，此種暗號，大都採用動植物名稱，中語如「香蕉」·「鳳凰」等·英語如「Sweet　Banana　BeautifulPhenix」等，蓋所以防免外界冒名拍發也。商行發送電報時，可先打電話至國際電臺，卽由電話接綫員，直接電傳室，當由電話收發員接應，然後說明發報人名，暗號，收報人名，地址，以及電文，臺方電話收發員收到電文後，卽還覆一次，俾發報人校對有無謬誤，於是手續齊備，卽可編號在發報機上拍出。反之，如國外有電報到來，臺方電話收發員，卽先將電文用電話傳達於收報人，收報人收到電文後，亦卽還覆一次，俾臺方電話收發員得以校對，此種手續，通常至多能以三分鐘辦妥之，殊稱便利。</p>
<p>（二）電傳機收發　電話傳送電報，較之人力遞送，固可謂敏捷多矣。然有數種特務機關，如國外滙兌行商，特種金融機關，以及新聞事業等，欲求更進一步之迅速準確簡便起見，於是電傳機Telepninfer尙矣。電傳機係一種機器。通以電流，有直達綫路接通發報人，其形宛如打字機，惟內部造，大為不同，字母鍵空處，亦較為寬闊，拍文時先將開建一按，機器卽嗡嗡作聲，此方機上拍時，彼方機上立顯原文。反之，彼方機上拍時，此方機上，立顯原文。用以對話，發送電文，報告消息，便利無比。通常發送一報，可於一二一分鐘內完畢，且有一種呼號鏈，「WhoAreYou」按之卽有機號顯出，對方得此，亦卽將機上該鏈一按回覆之。於是此方機上，亦有對方機號顯出。同時此方仠機員，知對方有人接應，卽可將電文拍送矣，現國際電台，已裝有該項機器六架，接通商行有八家，且裝有總轉接樞鈕，可以一機接通任何一家，亦卽任何一家，可以接通任何一機，於經濟上節省不少，每日收發電報，僅路透社一家，達七八十份之多，將來該項電傳機業務發展，誠未可以限量也。</p>
<p>上述二種遞送電報辦法，為國際電台對於社會貢獻之一，甚願各界樂為利用之！</p>
<h3>最近電報機械設備之改進</h3>
<p>— 葉仲華</p>
<p>語云：工欲善其事，必先利其器。吾電報通信之傳遞，旣以機械棧路為其主要之工具，然則如何使維持至於完善之境？自與工作效率有深切之影響。交部對於電報機械綫路之維持，向有嚴密管理之制度，辦理本極完善。近年以來，更謀一般設施之改進，以期工作效率之增加。茲將最近關於機械設備之改進，筆之於後，以餉讀者！</p>
<p>一，克利特印字機之改造克利特印字機（CreedmorsePrinter）之功用，係將克利特複鑿機（Creedreceivingperforator）收下之油紙條，（鑿有電報符號者）籍機械的作用，自動印成正式文字。收報局卽將印字機收下之一份，送交收報人。故處理手續，異常迅速。凡報務繁忙各局，大抵裝有此項設備，俾增加來報抄錄之速率，及避免人工的錯誤，華文四碼電報居多，而該機對於數目字之抄錄，因必須用大打打法，（卽—等於一點四劃。普通小打法，—祇等於一點一劃）始能印出。故材料時間，耗費較多，自為運用上之一大缺點。最近經上海電報局測騐室陳念椿君之悉心研究。擬利用該機不常用之符號七個，（因456三字之符號與羅馬字母並不衝突，故母須改造。）加以改造，使該機適合於四碼電報小打之用。聞交部業已採納陳君意見，並决將現有各印字機完全改造，以資應用。此項改造之成功，不特對於交部材料之耗費，年省鉅萬，卽電報傳遞之速率，亦大見增加。是誠極堪紀念之事也。</p>
<p>二，韋氏收報機與分流凝電器之裝用查架空電報綫路，因隔電子（Insulator）之絕綠抵抗，有時以氣候關係，常有變動，加之綫條均係平行架設，故工作時不免有漏電及感應之病。吾國各繁要綫路上，大抵裝置波紋收報機收受來報，但因該機之靈感度甚高，故過天時不佳時，卽易發現不規則之符號，工速率，因以减低。交部近為補救該項缺點起見，特於北平，南京，漢口，鄭縣，九江，南昌等局改裝韋氏收報機，以期減少上述漏電及感應之影響。聞裝用結果，成績極佳。再交部近於京滬，京平，京漢，平漢，滬漢，滬平，及平津等繁要電路之收報機上及帮電機上，裝置分流凝電器（Shunt　Condenser）各一具，俾工作速率（Working　Speed）得以增加。蓋電流經過收報機之綫圈，不免發生遲滞（Retardation）作用，在高速度工作時，往往因此種作用，使符號失其常態。現經分流凝電器之容量作用，將「遲滯作用」相互抵消，則工作速率，自可增加，聞各收報機上自裝用分流凝電器後，工作速率，可增加至百分之十以上。（未完）</p>
<h3>電視論叢</h3>
<p>— 十郎</p>
<p>電視事業之前程　Lord　Selsdon</p>
<p>余觀光美國，係研究調查彼邦之電視，將其現今進程如何，以呈報英國政府，俾英國廣播委員會與英國郵政局對於電視之傳遞，得以如何决定，卽係余之使命也。在未開放民用之前，關於視覺的廣播藝術，吾人當儘量探求之。目今英國廣播委員會影片之傳遞，雖在試騐中，已引起英國公衆之興趣。電視前稈遠大，至至顯明。但何時博得一般無綫電聽衆之歡迎，頗難說耳。</p>
<p>電子擴大器之功用　Dr.R.C.　Hergenroter</p>
<p>三百行以上優美之影像，能收納於戶外或室內，其光綫密度，恰與有聲電影后。電子的電視方法之進展，已達到此點。近來新式冷性陰極真空管名日電子擴大器之進步，大量的增加電視拍照機之靈敏度，且開無綫電收發電視信號功效之端。電視雖仍在美國試騐室中，但不久可以問世也。</p>

<h3>桃色慘殺案判決</h3>
<p>— 吹</p>
<p>據前日北平電訉，劉滕情殺案，已於昨日判決，速明無罪，劉景桂自首部分、成立，惟情形可憐，依刑法七十七條，處徒刑十二年，檢察官對逸無罪不服，決上訴，我想劉景桂殺人兇犯，法網難逃，而速則旣不敎唆，又不殺人，固何罪之有，法官援用律文，必無謬誤。</p>
<p>考本案的發生，原因實由績明初　景桂，繼又愛上滕爽又和劉離婚，和滕結婚，致劉忍無可忍，遂起殺績學之心，乃因某種關係，不易達到目的，乃變更計劃，而將情敵滕爽槍殺，使績失掉戀愛的目的物，以舒其憤，甘自首以償勝命，本案的真相如此。</p>
<p>但現在法律制度之下，婚姻對絕自由，無論離婚之有無理由，和離婚之任何多少，均可置之不問，因法律上原無規定離婚的罪名，則逯劉的離婚、亦和尋常一樣，何足爲罪，幷且劉之殺滕，原是劉本人意思，非但逯並不敎晙，而滕旣爲逯之愛人，則逯更處於損害地位，則逯罪何來。</p>
<p>要之，試問劉何以要殺滕，因殺逯不易達到目的，乃變計而殺情敵，又試問劉何以欲殺逯，因逯初和劉用欺騙手段，謬爲結合，日「今日以後，你是我的，我是你的，同宿無妨，」及達到目的，又和劉離異，致劉一受名譽上的損失，二受肉體上的侵害，無可報復，于是殺逯明和滕爽的念頭，乃更端而起，然則此次之桃色慘殺案，殺人者固劉景桂，而使造成此慘案者，實爲逯明，幷且離婚雖得無罪，然因離婚而所引起的惡果，則離婚者實不能不負其責，其理明甚。</p>
<p>攷法律的原權，本以扶直措枉爲本旨，而一案的發生，往往有相續的原理、因果的關係，而現在的法家，每舍因論果，不問前情、但論後果，宜逯明之無罪也。要之法律是死物，法官是活人、援用條文、原有斟酌之餘地、所以從前有「法無可恕、情尚可原，或情尚可原，法無可恕，」的伸縮語句，全在法官之衡情酌理，審度案情，若謂現在法官、只能援據律文，不准自由處斷，則殺人者死，律有明文，該法官何得以情形可憐，赦其死罪、改爲徒刑。</p>
<p>此種判案的失當，實爲明顯的事實，我更舉一例以明之，譬有某甲，爲流矢所中，請外科某乙醫治、某乙取其矢之在外者而鋸去之，曰已治矣，甲曰，矢尚在內，何謂已治，乙曰，我是外科，只能治外，皮肉以內，是內科之職，而非我之所有事也，聞者莫不笑之，現在法官之論案，但論結果，而不問原因，情形何乃類是。</p>
<h3>靈峰寺</h3>
<p>— 覺夫</p>
<p>這是孤立在半山上的一問古寺。牠的前面臨着一窪明鏡似的湖水，四周緊包着古雅的梅叢，靑翠的修竹；站在山脚抬頭看上去，看不見一片瓦簽，一角墻壁，顯現在眼前的，只是隱伏在薄霧中的一大簇蒼綠的林叢而已。從山脚通上去，雖也有一條曲折的石道，但這上面早已被蘚苦蔓草所蓋滿了。——這或許正就是在表明這古寺的不幸的運命吧</p>
<p>其實，在這一個以寺觀著稱的古城中，這裏實也可算得是香火最冷落的一個了的：就在最熱鬧的春節，旁的地方早已像熱鬧的街市似的，成天擁擠了香客和遊人，而這裏還是依舊保持着牠原來的寂寞，無聲無息地在蒼綠的林叢中隱藏着。</p>
<p>但是，或許也正因香客遊人的脚跡罕到的緣故，幽閒淸靜的山林幽趣，這里是還很儂郁地存留着的。倘要賞賞「蟬噪林逾靜，鳥鳴山更幽，」的風味，移步到這里來徜徉一趟，大概也許可以領略得到的。</p>
<p>我在這破舊的古寺中，雖僅消磨了我半天的時光，但牠給予我的印象，是永不會從我的腦子中忘掉了的。</p>
<p>是在一個新雨初霽的早上，高掛在遠近山頭上的晨霧，尚沒有收歛起，隱伏在綠柳掩映下的西子湖，也好像還在那里酣睡着，我就獨自蹈上鋪滿蘚苔蔓的石階，穿進靑葱的竹林，直向在寂寞的氛圍中默立着得這這古寺走來。當我蹈進殘敗的殿堂時，一個滿面皺紋的和尚，正在那里默默地打盹，兀坐在兩邊的幾磸泥像，也默默地在那里苦顏相對着。整個殿宇，全充滿着陰森凄冷的氣雰，不管是神龕，是佛像，是香爐燭台……都很明顯地塗着一層衰敗冷落的痕蹟。置身在這里，就好像是走進古墓道似的，敎人禁不住不起了一陣劇烈的戰慓！</p>
<p>瞌睡着的和尚，大概是被我的鞋聲所驚醒的吧，抬起頭來，擦擦眼睛，立卽驚惶地向我瞟一眼。他雖沒有說什麼，但細看他那驚奇的眼光，好像是在說：「啊！你也到這里來幹嗎？」</p>
<p>我在這凄冷的殿宇中，轉了一個團子，就走進廟旁的那一個淸雅的梅園中來。梅花雖早已凋謝了，但在那蒼老的枝幹上，滿綴着豆大的梅實，看來倒也古雅有趣。我在緊密的綠蔭底下，揀一塊凈潔的石頭坐下來，一邊從目看看銀色的湖水，高聳的峯巔，掛在峯巔上的白雲：一邊傾耳細聽淙淙的流泉，淸脆的鳥鳴，輕風拂過林叢的沙沙聲……久被大都市的媒烟氣薰逐了的心，這時不覺頓起了一種悠然世外之感！</p>
<p>我在這綠梅翠竹的懷抱中，整整默坐了二個多鐘頭，直至赤紅的驕陽，從茂竹的頂梢上探出頭來時，我才悄悄地緩步走下山來，及至走抵山脚。怡然回頭一看時，還好像自己一伴什麽最心愛的東西，失掉在那一簇隱隱的茂竹叢中似的！</p>
<h3>變</h3>
<p>— 凌秄錫</p>
<p>還是前三個年頭、田裏多收了一點穀，而金三嫂也在上海「幫人家」多了幾個錢、回來的時候，看見金三高高興興的，又看見那個從六歲就領過來做養媳的玲妹子也更豐滿地長成了，「已經是做大人的時候了」，想。便趁着年世好、手頭來得，趕緊巴巴地把那個傻頭傻腦的，粗笨的，在鎭上學木匠的兒子雙喜領回來給他們小倆口兒併了親；可是到現在，日子一天天地壞下去，田裏的生活也實在難「開銷」了，家裏多一個人吃飯，便像多壓了一部大磨盤一樣的沈重。兒子雙喜是在外邊店裏做工的日子多，金三嫂又是常年在外面「吃人家飯」的，家裏孤單單地留着金三和玲妹子可不大方便，而况玲妹子還沒有孩子，留在家裏吃閒飯幹麽？爲了這一大串的緣故，金三嫂便决意把玲妹子帶到上海去「吃人家飯」了。雙喜是個傻貨，自然是說不出什麼話來的，可是玲妹子是從來</p>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>沒有出過本士的，不知道外面的世界究竟是怎麽一種樣子，給金三嫂帶去的時候，還哭過哩。</p>
<p>可是隔壁那個在上海紗廠裏做過三年工的阿發娘子却當了金三嫂的面那麽說了：「三嫂子，要不是眞過不去的話，讓玲妹子留在鄉裏還好些呢：上海是一個大染缸啊，小姑娘又不是呆貨，那麽一個伶伶俐俐的孩子，怕不會……？」</p>
<p>可金三嫂是主意打得千穩百穩了的，一股氣便把玲妹子拖着走了：「嚼什麽舌根——丫頭是個老實的傢伙，帶在自己身邊、還怕什麽！別說是染缸，便是虎口也……難道說年紀輕輕的丫頭到了上海就平白地會給人吞了的嗎？」</p>
<p>「嚼舌根嗎？看罷，你看着罷！年紀輕輕的丫頭，將來的事情誰曉得唔？毛頭姑娘十八變，外面的世界大着，花樣也多着呢！上海，好地方咾？喝，是一口大染缸啊」！</p>
<p>那麽着：人，和時間同樣的。遠遠地飄去了。</p>
<p>到第二個年頭的稻熟的時候，田野裏依舊是充塞着一片荒收的不快意和嘆息：可是金三嫂却帶了玲妹子（又秘密地把積下的十五塊銀洋縫在被絮裏帶來了）回來了。人瞧着玲妹子可吃了一驚；已經完全變得不認識啦：剪了髮，穿上了短袖口的袍子（雖然是布的），橡皮鞋：學會了上海白，學會了上海女人的走踏的樣子（在鄉下，人看着是有點「惹眼」的），也學會了搽劣質的雪花膏，與討厭吃飯時候放在桌子中央的「老牌美孚燈」的昏暗了；最後，瞧着雙喜的傻氣，簡直極了桌子駡了起來，倒晚上，便一個人倒在床上偸偸地哭了——這是沒有人知道，也沒有人想得到的。</p>
<p>「巳經不再是適宜於生活在鄉下的人了」，村裏的人，除了雙喜全那麽想，是的，這一次重回上海去的時候，玲妹子已經懂得把驕傲的笑來代替一年前的哭了。</p>
<p>就在隔了半年多的一個夏大，有人從上海下鄕的帶了一個口信來，說金三嫂呌金三趕快帶了雙喜到上海去；「上海那邊出了事：玲妹子跟人逃走了」！</p>
<p>消息是像打雷一般地驚住了邨上的人，驚住了金三他們！不以為奇的就只有在上海的紗廠裏做過三年工的阿發娘子一個：「我說過的咾：毛頭姑娘十八變，上海是好地方唔？——是一口挺大的染缸啊」！</p>
<h3>長　汽車</h3>
<p>— 朱養晦作</p>
<h3>亞達子姑娘</h3>
<p>— 微茫</p>
<p>從剛回國的朋友處吃到新從南洋帶來的蜜餞亞達子，那堅實而甜溫的果子一從口腔溜過，一道甜和的味道便從心上飄起來，令人猛地想起久別至遠隔的亞達子姑娘來。</p>
<p>亞達子姑娘生長在椰林子里，現在已是經長長的七年不曾見面了，棕黑色的臉孔像亞達子的赤色的果皮，圓圓的面頰煞像亞達子的小小的個子，而那堅實的體幹，更像亞達子的肉體。更其使她得到「亞達子姑娘」這個稱號的，是她那溫和的性情，和使人一見便發生甜蜜的戀情來。</p>
<p>認識亞達子姑娘的時候，她方十四歲。然而赤熱的氣候已使這位姑娘早像婦人般的成熟了。她會唱馬來歌，會講馬來民間故事，更會說一口流利而令聽者心悅的馬來話。她的母親是爪哇人，所以雖然父親是位荒林裏的中國商人，却是過慣了馬來人的生活，沈浸在馬來傳統的習慣裏面的。</p>
<p>常常同一班男朋友們騎脚踏卓到叢林裏去玩，她會毫無顧忌地坦白地和男子們說笑和戲謔。大家玩得熱的時候，她也會跟男朋友一同跳入河裏，裸起上半身，只罩着一伴紗籠在河心洗操。游泳的技術也着實不差。有一次在河心瞥見了一只鱷魚，便慌張地騎在一位善泳的男朋友肩上，趕快游回岸上來。一到岸上，便不住地喊：</p>
<p>「嚇壞了我！嚇壤了我！」</p>
<p>却是張開一張大口哈哈地大笑了。</p>
<p>父親的朋友們都不滿意她，說：</p>
<p>「中國人的禮敎都給破壞了！這個馬來化德姑娘，你怎不管敎她？</p>
<p>然而做父親的卻像愛惜母親般得愛她，說：</p>
<p>「我的女孩子還小哩！」</p>
<p>而亞達子姑娘也嘟起了嘴唇說：</p>
<p>「難道我只好同女朋友們玩，不可同男朋友玩麽？我偏要做個男子漢的女子！」</p>
<p>是的，她的態度異常坦白而率眞。她具有爪哇人的血，却也還有中國人的血的。她愛每個男朋友，而每個男朋友也都愛他。她不偏愛，不墮入情網，也不像爪哇婦人般得縱於肉欲。她還天眞得像個小孩子，雖然她的身體顯然巳很發育了。</p>
<p>待到亞達子姑娘從荷蘭的中學校畢業回　　時候，他已經不是完全沒有　識的野姑娘了。個是她的對人的態度還是一樣。依舊的天眞，好笑，愛同男朋友玩；依舊使見她的人個個都愛她，個個都像吃過了蜜餞亞達子般的甜蜜而溫　的感覺。</p>
<p>五年之後，　達子姑娘已經十九歲了。一次，剛從巴達維亞的醫學專門學校放假回來，人便見她的態度完全變了：不笑，也不同朋友們玩；長日孤寂地在家裏獨居着；圓圓的面頰也消瘦了，像晒乾的亞達子一樣。</p>
<p>朋友們都驚詫起來了，而父親也皺着眉，東跑西跑地探詢她女兒變態的緣故。大家都莫明其妙。</p>
<p>一直到有一天亞達子姑娘接到一封信，便突然宣佈要到海牙去。父親只好摸不頭腦地聽從她，而朋友們也都到海口送她上輪船。</p>
<p>亞達子姑娘開口了，說：</p>
<p>「男子們是多麽不可靠，我一定到海牙去找他！」</p>
<p>他，是誰呢？她沒有說。我們只好猜是她的同學兼情人。</p>
<p>此後，便沒有亞達子姑娘的消息。朋友們都替她嘆惜着。一直七年了，我差不多忘記了她：今天才從亞達子而想到她了；究竟這位男子風的姑娘，會因失戀，而跑到那兒去呢？</p>

<h3>藝華花絮</h3>
<p>岳楓繼「逃亡」後的新劇本在編裂中，劇名尚未定，內容充溢着詩意的恣態。</p>
<p>「逃亡」在中央大戲院重映以來，賣座與在金城公映時之盛况相同。</p>
<p>當應雲衛的「時代英雄」初次在藝華公司的編審委具會上提出商討時，在座的人沒有不對于這劇本表示讚好，當時方沛霖曾這樣的說：「假如老應這部戲拍成功之後，他所得到的讚譽一定比「桃李刦」還要重大，我敢這樣的說。</p>
<p>胡萍在「生之哀歌」中演技，誰都承認已有長足的進步，但，史東山導演的有聲片「人之初」中的胡萍，演藝是更有了進步，在「人之初」裏，她是飾着一個從青春到衰老的女人。</p>
<p>中國影片中一人兼飾兩個角色在同一畫面中出現的，只有女明星胡蝶在「姊妹花」中，男明星尚未之有，現在「人之初」中的王引，就破了例，他一人就是兼飾着兩個角色，一個是做鐵匠的小根，一個是富家子家駒，同時，兩人還在一起口角，他所飾的這兩個角色有着與在逃亡中一樣的成功。</p>
<p>會集了中國電影界中最優秀的技術人材合作的「人之初」，全劇已大都完成，現在只有零碎的幾個外景鏡頭。昨天，「人之初」到永安紗紡廠去拍取紡紗工人的工作鏡頭，一連工作了五小時，每一個人都從呼吸中吸進了不少棉花絮，尤其是周克吸得最多，歸來之後，吸入肺部裏的棉花絮，忽「不安于肺」羣欲跑出，于是周克每一咳嗽中吐出的痰，必有不少棉花絮滲雜在內，于是大胖子陳麟書見了便開玩笑說：「周克會口吐棉化」。</p>

<h3>辣斐六缸新車之特色</h3>
<p>— 敷</p>
<p>辣斐六缸新車。為納喜廠所精造。茲已由本埠經售商赫金公司。貢獻於世。新車售價屬於低價類。但對於高貴車輛所有之一切特色。則莫不兼而有之。說者謂以若斯低價之車輛。而具有如許特色。洵屬難能可貴云。新車特色。不勝枚舉。茲特以其犖犖大者。略述如次。</p>
<p>（一）八十匹馬力引擎。（二）各式車上一律裝配諧動彈簧系。（三）特別寬敞車身（四）七粒軸承拐軸低價車而有此特色者惟屬辣斐。（五）壓力保冷。（洋）鋁質合金精製活塞。（七）特優接連桿。（八）蝸桿與鋼棍式無阻力轉向機。（九）加大電氣系。（十）加闊後輪轍。五九又十六分之十一。（十一）寬闊座位前座五十寸後座五十一寸半。（十二）特優汽缸體。（十三）主要軸承面積六六。三四方寸。（十四）自動歧管。（十五）諧動變速機。（十六）專利式减震葉子。（揷於彈簧葉子問）（十七）班迪斯均等動作塞車。配有輪轉式均制器。（十八）雙重搆造之鋼車身。（十九）嵌式無綫電機天綫。（二十）安全式前車門。（二十一）納喜廠情造。</p>
<h3>赫德森與地上飛一律裝配全鋼車身</h3>
<p>— 篔</p>
<p>嘗攷「全鋼車身」。雖為喧傳已久之一名詞。但其實則今年始有之。蓋在今年以前。所謂「全鋼車身」者。其車頂之中央。固猶以輕性物料搆成之也。今則一九三五年式赫德森出品。連地上飛在內。始不愧為眞正全鋼車身。其全部構製。絕未應用絲毫木料。除車窗外。所有底板邊板前方後方及車頂等。悉以堅實鋼料搆成。乘客置身車中。則環繞於其周圍上下者皆鋼也。故可藉其嚴密保障。以享受絕對安全焉。</p>
<p>尤足稱者。赫德森與地上飛之全鋼車身。不僅安全可靠。抑且安靜異常。凡可觸及耳鼓之一切顚震聲音。均已由音響學專家。設法抑制之。使其消滅於無形。故其安靜程度。且遠勝於以前所出各式車身。赫德森出品所以益為人所愛好者。如此優美之全鋼車身。蓋卽其原因之一也。</p>

<h3>平凡的亨利福特</h3>
<p>悠悠自在生活簡單</p>
<p>（地特勞伊德自由報麥孔平蓋作）</p>
<p>任何消息靈通的地特勞伊德人士。所最常常受人詢及的問題。就是：「亨利福特究竟是怎樣一種人物」。我想在我的過去二十五年中。人家拿帶句話來問我的。比較任何其他問題為多。問這話的人。各界人士都有。而尤以新聞雜誌的記者·工程師·社會學者·歷史家·以及學生界居多。這些人士從世界各地到地特勞伊德來。研究這個號稱做世界二十世紀城市的地特勞伊德。</p>
<p>我對於這些求得不可能的知識的人士。所能給予的唯一答語。無非是福特先生不過是一個平　人他今天所做的事。和他很長久以前　　的事。是毫無分別的在那時候的一個星期日下午。他在聖克來爾氷上獲得了世界的紀錄。他今日的行動。和他從前在市政廳前的舊貨車櫃台上吃他的午餐的時候。是毫無二樣。他的思想方法是如此的簡單和淸楚。竟使志在尋求深遠複雜事物之研究家茫然莫解呢。亨利福特仍舊是一個村人。歡喜「尋訪」。歡喜坐下來闡發他的意見。他旣然是一個順乎自然的平凡人物。所以他對於他自己的發言。並不認為有什麽大大深奧的所在。</p>
<p>我確實想他寗可騎墻而與別的田農暢談收穫。不願與世界大人　討論他們所認為深奧嚴重的問題。因為他從來沒有讓他自己墮入世人思想程則的常軌。所以他觀察事物格外淸楚了。所有世界上認為學問的。豈知竟有大不然者在乎</p>
<p>我們所最習聞的遊歷家的驚奇聲。厥為亨利福特自己並無辦公室之一語。多數意見都以為這是他特性中最奇怪的一點。但你倘使詢問他們為什麽他應該有一個辦公室呢。那末他們衆口一辭地答道：「為什麼攏總別的執行人都有辦公室的啊」。福特先生倘使也有一間辦公室。他將莫知所從了。所以他免除了這種不必要的事物。他不用辦公室而用他的腦經來思想。</p>
<p>據我所見。我可確定他是歡喜做一個平凡的人物。但是世人不讓他如此。有時他情願溜到地亞邦的理髮店中作一次之修鬚。並且和其他村人一般坐下來順次等修。但這一點的小趣味，他竟也享受不到。一大羣的人擠滿在那裏。使此事成為不可能。好幾年前。他常常在午後到（D．A．C．）地特勞伊德體育俱樂部的理髮店中去。但就是在那地方他也不能得到隱秘啊。</p>
<p>他本人旣成為大衆心目中之人物。所以他已無隱秘之可言。他必須用種種保護方法來圍繞他自己。以便過他自己的生活。他並不較優於他所喜愛混在一起的人們。倘使他再不設法防範。那末他終年也不能有一分鐘的餘閒做他自己的事了。</p>
<p>他的嗜好和平常的人一般簡單。從人生小事物中尋樂趣。再沒有他人比他得到更多快樂的了他比一般的田農更接近士壤。任何機械的跳動。都能很迅速地在他血液中得到一種反應的呼聲。和靑年兒童初次受機製玩具的魔力一樣。他對於一只巢居小鳥和對於民族命運戚到同樣深度的興趣。他能見到兩者之中的比較。</p>
<p>在亨利福特眼中的世界。是長春不老的。所以他仍舊保有靑年的心靈。</p>
<h3>飛突猛進的英國汽車業</h3>
<p>— 影呆</p>
<p>（一）產車的數量汽車事業。目前在英國的重工業中。已進展到第四位。我們回想起來。英國的汽車事業。祇有三十年的歷史。在這短短的三十年中。汽車業在英國。由萌芽時代而到達今日的地位。進展的神速。使我們不得不表示驚奇。直接或問接。為汽車業服務的工人。巳有五十萬人之多。汽車事業的發展。不但使各種副業也隨以發展。連得重要的工業。如鋼鐵。電氣。橡皮。皮革等等。也為汽車業而得以增加發展的力量。中價汽車近年以來。已非常普遍。而且目前的銷數。更在繼續地增加。關於這點。委實是使英國汽車業疾速發展的一大原因。至一九三四年九月底為止。一年之中。英國各汽車廠。總共產車二四〇·七八〇輛。和上一個年度相較。增加了二〇·〇〇〇輛。去年的汽車註冊。比一九三三年增加百分之二十四。可是和一九三二年相較。竟增加百分之五十呢。</p>
<p>（二）製造的進步新式的英國製客車和貨車。製造方面。已到達非常可靠。幾年前以夢想不到的限度。機件上的構造。更很少缺憾。如果把本年度早期的新車。和一九三四式相形之下。又有很多進步了。除了外觀方面。具有相當的改進之外。加上安舒可靠。和售價的低减。新車的上面。有電力燈。電力發動。窗帘開關。方向指示。綫圈發火。諧動齒輪。低壓車胎。减震器。改良的坐墊。簡單的塞車。和安全玻璃等。這裏所說的不過是優點中的一小部分呢。這種進步。更影響於政府的稅收。目前英國的汽車稅。雖已低减。但車主方面。每年依舊要繳稅七〇·〇〇〇·〇〇〇金鎊。為了車輛的註冊日見加多。稅收方面。非但不减。反見增加。而政府方面。把這些捐稅。大部分用在改進道路的上面。</p>
<h2>Page 32</h2>
<p>（三）出口的增多英國的汽車。製造方面。有長足的進步。我們祇要看近年以來。出口的數量。日見增加。海外各國。信用的日孚。便可蹬明了。自一九三一年到目前。英國汽車的出口。數量方面。已增加一倍。去年家用汽車共出口三四·九〇五輛。值價四·八五五·二八七金鎊。而一九三三年祇出口三三，七六三輛。值價四·三六二·三三三金鎊。包括汽車零件和各部機件。出口的總值價一一·三〇五·四九七金鎊。而一九三三年祇九·三七三·八二六金鎊。機車事業。英國依舊是領導各國。但出口數是低落了。卽此可見機車的銷數。在英國。比較國內市塲是來得活躍。出口的數量。總共一六·四九七輛。值六四八·九九八金鎊。一九三四年是一七·七二五輛。值六七〇·四一六金鎊。</p>
<p>（四）貨車的發展近年以來。英國各汽車廠。對於重量貨車。也已開始製造。自採用「笛賽爾」引擎之後。爲了引擎的有力。載重的加多。事實上也可因以促使貨車事業的發展。新式四噸重或四噸以上的貨車。裝配「笛賽爾」引擎的。竟佔百分之六十五。尤其是工業或農業的拖曳車。裝用的更多。貨車在英國。近來的確有神速的進展自一九三三年十月至一九三四年八月爲止。英國各車廠所製貨車。達七八·〇〇一輛。比上一個年度增加一九·〇〇〇輛。另外更有一伴特別有趣的事情。便是本年初起。世界各國有好多已把汽車馬力稅低减。有的减百分之二十五。這也可鼓勵英國車廠多製多馬力汽車的。</p>
<p>（五）前途的展望在過去一年之中。英國的汽車。製造方面的改進。更注意到駕駛問題。使變速的簡便敏捷。已成爲共通之點。外觀方面。流綫型也有相當的改進。使後面的備胎和行李。放置之時。完全不見。同時於减少風力的抵禦問題。也非常注意。在現代文明之下。汽車一物。雖爲人類所獲一種禮物。但在英國。爲了有道路法的規定。依舊受到種種限制。以事實而言。未來的汽車。要求其進步。就在希望道路和其他汽車本身所不能統馭的一切的改進。目前英國汽車事業。有如此的發展。使得英國的車廠。對於前途得抱樂觀。照眼前的情形看來。在未來的幾年之中。汽車業將繼續有進步和發展的可能呢。</p>

<p>此圖係一種富有彈性之鐵絲網。專用於汽車折行經向公路轉角。堤壩。路底。橋旁等危險處。功能煞住車行。免肇禍端。所附之圓形圖。表示汽車越出路綫。幸爲網籬阻住。得免覆車之禍。各省公路或依山而築。或背山面海。汽車行經轉灣處。極爲危險。肇禍時聞。是項護網。當能爲旅客添一重安全保障也（上海楊樹浦公勤鐵廠創製國貨護網）</p>

<h3>Executive Yuan Decides to Adjust Responsibilities and Passes the Appointment of Deng as Sacrificial Official of the Supreme Sage and Four Associate Sages and Succession Procedures</h3>
<p>Appointment of Deng and Another as Deputy Commanders of the Second Route of Suppression</p>
<p>(Nanjing) The Executive Yuan held its 210th meeting at 9:00 AM on the 30th, attended by Wang Zhaoming, Chen Shaokuan, Chen Gongbo, Wang Shijie, Zhu Jiahua, Huang Musong, Chen Shuren, Liu Ruiheng, and others. Chairman Wang Zhaoming presided. The following important matters were resolved:</p>
<p>(A) Review and Reporting Matters</p>
<p>(1) Reports from the Rural Reconstruction Committee (Chairman Wang), the Ministry of Industry (Minister Chen), the Ministry of Communications (Minister Zhu), the Ministry of Railways (Minister Gu), the Acting Vice Minister of the Interior (Tao), and the Director of the Department of Health (Liu), regarding the instruction to participate in discussions on how to adjust the responsibilities of the Executive Yuan that overlap with other agencies. Following joint meetings with representatives from the Economic Committee and the Construction Committee, three opinions were drafted: 1. The relevant committees and ministries should list and explain the work that overlaps with the responsibilities of other agencies, stating the position of the respective agency, and submit it to the Yuan for compilation into a report. 2. The Yuan should invite agencies most directly related to production and construction, such as the Rural Reconstruction Committee, the Ministry of Industry, the Ministry of Railways, the Ministry of Communications, the Economic Committee, the Military Affairs Commission, and the Construction Committee, to hold joint meetings every six months to report on their work and discuss implementation plans. 3. The work of the Economic Committee and the Construction Committee should be reported to the Executive Yuan at any time for approval. Resolved: Change "six months" to "three months." The rest was approved.</p>
<p>(2) Reports from the Minister of Finance (Kong), the Minister of Industry (Chen), and the Minister of Education (Wang), regarding the instruction to review the Ministry of Industry's request for subsidies for the Changsha Taitian Porcelain Industry Training Institute. The review concluded that subsidies should be granted appropriately, and it was proposed to subsidize 4,000 yuan annually starting from the 24th year of the Republic. Resolved: Approved according to the review opinion.</p>
<p>(B) Appointment and Removal Matters</p>
<p>(1) The Military Affairs Commission requested that Wang Jialie be appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the Second Route Army for suppressing bandits, and You Guocai as the Deputy Commander-in-Chief. Resolved: Approved.</p>

It is said, "...In the past, mythology was used to study the date when humans first took shape. If we couldn't find it, we would consider January 7th as 'Human Day' for commemoration. Now we know that only with universal human rights can we have a human society. Therefore, everyone thinks that only May 1st is the day to commemorate universal human rights. It is appropriate to consider this day as 'Human Day' and use it as a commemorative day for universal human rights." Considering the day of commemorating universal human rights as "Human Day" is more appropriate than commemorating the day when humans first took shape based on mythology. Based on this meaning, if we can do our best to promote literacy education so that everyone in our country is literate and we can eliminate illiteracy one day, then the day we start promoting literacy education may also be designated as "Human Day" for the cultural advancement of our country.</p>
<p>The emergence of writing is due to the factual needs of the evolution of human groups. Since writing emerged due to factual needs, this writing must be a tool for public use by the group. According to common sense, everyone should be literate, and everyone should be able to apply this writing. Unfortunately, the social organization has a phenomenon of partial human rights. The use of writing has not been popularized to the entire people, so there is so-called illiteracy. The blind cannot see and are considered disabled. Illiterates do not have any physiological defects but are not healthy people. They cannot receive the knowledge transmitted by writing, and their personal welfare is sacrificed, not to mention that the evolution of society is greatly affected. Therefore, promoting literacy education is like restoring health to a disabled person. Who says it is inappropriate for us to call the day we start this movement "Human Day"?</p>
<p>The origin of illiteracy stems from the phenomenon of partial human rights. If we want to eliminate illiteracy, we must eliminate the phenomenon of partial human rights at the same time. In the new era of the twentieth century, there seems to be no room for the phenomenon of partial human rights to exist. Moreover, the promotion of literacy education advocated by the municipal government is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's legacy that a revolution to achieve people's livelihood must awaken the masses. In this regard, we should be more convinced that there is a deep relationship between the elimination of illiteracy and the universal human rights movement. The Shanghai Literacy Education Committee's Literacy Education Promotion Week starts on the day commemorating universal human rights. Its significance is thought-provoking.</p>
<h3>Glimpses of Arita's Suggestions</h3>
<p>According to the Tokyo Hochi Shimbun of April 25th, Minister Arita has repeatedly exchanged views with Foreign Minister Hirota to establish a concrete policy toward China and has reached complete agreement. At the same time, he consulted with Prime Minister Okada and Army Minister Hayashi to actively rebuild diplomacy toward China. On the other hand, he discussed concrete strategies for economic cooperation between Japan and China with private industrialists. After fully examining the domestic situation, he is scheduled to return to his post in June. According to the Asahi Shimbun, Minister Arita will report on the progress of his China policy, reveal his beliefs, and urge the foreign ministry to reflect. He said that since this spring, the Nanjing government has expressed its attitude toward Japan and changed its diplomatic relations with Japan over the years. However, the Japanese government should seize this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity, exercise great self-restraint, and prepare for China. Therefore, he hopes that the foreign ministry will recognize this point and avoid rash actions. In the future, instructions to embassies in China should take into account the overall situation. Public opinion circles in Japan must also recognize the points that should not be publicized to achieve the effect of China policy.</p>
<h3>British Ministry of Health Proves Chinese Eggs are Non-Toxic</h3>
<p>(London) Pathologists at the Ministry of Health, after careful examination of samples of liquid Chinese eggs, have now issued a report stating that Chinese eggs meet the perfect standards of cleanliness and purity and also meet the standards for bacterial count required for (A) grade milk. The Huitong News reported this news today and said that no one can say for sure whether diseases or food poisoning in England are caused by Chinese eggs. Furthermore, no one can determine how Chinese eggs transmit disease to humans. It is heard that the full text of this report will soon be submitted to Parliament. (29th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Senior U.S. Military Officer Suggests Adding Air Force Bases. Location to be Near Canada. Canada Considers it a Violation of the Gentlemen's Agreement</h3>
<p>(Washington) The bill to build six army aviation bases along the Atlantic and Pacific coasts and in Alaska, after being passed by the House Armed Services Committee, still included a clause stipulating the construction of a strong aviation base in the U.S. Great Lakes region bordering Canada, which was submitted to the committee by Deputy Chief of Staff Kilbourne. (29th Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) Major General Kilbourne reported to Congress today that if the United States opens a strong air force base in Alaska, Japan's foreign policy will be greatly affected. Kilbourne, who served as the U.S. Army's chief strategist, said, "New bombers are now very advanced, and Japan fears aerial attacks. Therefore, how our relationship with Japan and Japan's peaceful talks with us will be affected if there is an air force base in Alaska is obvious." Kilbourne opposed building an air force base in the Aleutian Islands because he thought the flying environment there was particularly bad. However, the mainland is different, so it may be possible to build near Dutch Harbor, and that place has been recognized as a place to build an Alaskan naval port. Observers here say that Congress may not take any action on Alaska immediately. This naval exercise has already caused a lot of criticism, and peace groups generally believe that this is a kind of militaristic expression to Japan. Now that Kilbourne has different claims, Congress will proceed more cautiously. On the other hand, Secretary of State Hull is also eager to maintain the most friendly relationship with Japan. Therefore, Hull will probably oppose any action that can be considered harmful to Japanese friendship. (29th Day National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) The secret clause submitted to the House Military Affairs Committee by Senior U.S. Military Officer Major General Kilbourne today has caused diplomatic misunderstandings between the United States and Canada. Canada has always been the most friendly with the United States, and Kilbourne's blatant proposal will arouse resentment from Japan. It is heard that Kilbourne suggested opening an aviation base near the Canadian border to facilitate transcontinental aviation and large-scale equipment for the takeoff and landing of fighter jets. After hearing Kilbourne's proposal, the Canadian government immediately asked the U.S. government to send the full text of Kilbourne's proposal. Canada believes that this statement is an unfriendly gesture and violates the gentlemen's agreement between the two countries that prohibits fortifications on the U.S.-Canada border. It is heard that Secretary of State Hull will express sympathy with Canada and oppose the proposal to set up an aviation base on the Canadian border. Canada has no unfriendly situation. Hull is also willing to maintain friendship between the U.S. and Japan and will also oppose any action that may arouse Japanese jealousy. (29th Day National News Agency Dispatch)</p>

Currently, naval authorities are keeping the "Question No. 16" fleet a strict secret. (29th Day National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<h3>British House of Commons Discusses German Shipbuilding Plan. Simon Says Britain is Considering a Response.</h3>
<p>(London) The British House of Commons reopened today. The expression of its attention to the international situation can be known from this. When asked, the House asked the Foreign Secretary to announce the international situation. Simon replied that the Prime Minister had spoken about the situation of the Stresa Conference, and the results of the League of Nations Administrative Council meeting were detailed in the newspapers. He will speak in detail again during the debate on Thursday. A Member of Parliament asked whether the Ministry of Foreign Affairs was aware of the German government's plan to build several submarines. What steps does the Foreign Secretary intend to take to deal with this repeated breach of agreement? Foreign Secretary Simon's answer was brief, only saying that the German government has issued an order to build twelve 250-ton submarines, but it has not yet been indicated whether the Kiel submarine school has reopened. Former Foreign Secretary Austen Chamberlain asked when the German government made this representation to the British government. Simon replied that he remembered it was April 25th. Conservative Party Herbert asked whether the government would try to make the League of Nations pay attention to Germany's repeated violations of the treaty and asked whether the preparations for the Anglo-German naval talks were still planned. Simon replied that he could not answer this question because the issue of legality was currently being considered. Austen Chamberlain asked the Prime Minister about the procedures for the debate on Thursday. The Prime Minister replied that he would still follow the usual method of consulting the opposition party first. Labor Party leader Lansbury claimed that the Labor Party believed that the government would make an announcement at the beginning of the debate, and he hoped that the scope of the debate would be broad. The Prime Minister replied that the government would definitely comply with this request. (29th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Regarding Germany's building submarines and reorganizing its naval military preparations, the British government will probably lodge a protest soon. Today, Foreign Secretary Simon replied to a Member of Parliament's question in the House of Commons, saying, "The German government announced around April 28th that it had decided to build twelve submarines, each with a displacement of 250 tons. This second violation of the Treaty of Versailles raises legal issues that the government is currently studying." Another Member of Parliament asked the government whether this move by Germany would hinder future Anglo-German naval talks. Simon replied that the matter was currently under consideration by the government. (29th Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Germany Notifies Britain of Postponement of Naval Conference. British Parliament to Make Important Declaration Tomorrow.</h3>
<p>(London) The Anglo-German naval conference was originally scheduled to be held within this week. Now, at the request of the German government, it has been postponed until after mid-May. At that time, German leader Hitler will respond to the League of Nations resolution condemning Germany's rearmament and announce Germany's foreign policy. The British government has not yet made any decision on Germany's submarine construction, but important remarks will definitely be made when the House of Commons debates national defense matters on Thursday. If Anglo-German naval talks are realized in the future, Britain does not want to approve Germany's naval demands without a general agreement with the countries concerned. (30th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(London) Germany today submitted a proposal to Britain regarding the Anglo-German naval conference. At the same time, the German government has completed its warship construction plan. According to official sources here, Germany's construction plan includes the following three items:</p>
<p>(1) Immediately build twelve 250-ton submarines. The submarines can go deep into the water to a place that bottom bombs cannot reach and can travel 6,000 miles without adding fuel.</p>
<p>(2) Start building five 30,000-ton to 35,000-ton battleships. The drawings have already been drawn.</p>
<p>(3) Increase the construction of sixteen 10,000-ton cruisers, which are faster than the giant cruisers of the British and American navies. According to the German authorities, Foreign Secretary Simon said that the submarine style planned by Germany is very novel, and its purpose is to influence maritime hegemony. As for the agenda of the Anglo-German naval conference, Naval Attaché Wasner of the German Embassy in Britain has submitted it to the British government. Wasner had a long meeting with Naval Chief of Staff Sir Buyfair, outlining Germany's plan. According to general interpretation, the meaning of Germany's suggestion this time is that leader Hitler wants to postpone the originally scheduled meeting on May 2nd by a few days so that he can issue a statement defending his new naval policy. Observers believe that Hitler's move is intended to dispel British panic and indicate that Germany does not intend to compete with Britain in naval power as it did before the European War. According to the current situation, Hitler can start the meeting by mid-May. According to what Wasner said, the German representatives will be General Hughesde, Commander Keitelon, General Ribbentrop, and Wasner himself. At the same time, the debate in the British House of Commons also focused on Germany's submarine construction plan. Some people said that these dangerous warships are directly targeting Britain. Foreign Secretary Simon said that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently studying the matter. According to unofficial news, Prime Minister MacDonald is preparing to hold a meeting with French and Italian officials to discuss Germany's violation of the Treaty of Versailles. Observers believe that the submarine issue is particularly important to Britain, as Britain suffered huge losses from German submarines during the Prisoner of War War. Germany's naval plan is of course more important to Britain than to France and Italy. However, the three countries have already stated that they will deal with Germany's reorganization of the navy in a unified manner at the future Rome Conference. (30th Day National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Washington) According to the U.S. Navy Department's speculation, after Germany builds submarines, Britain will inevitably be forced to increase its naval military preparations. The London Naval Treaty has a "ladder clause" provision, which stipulates that if any other country increases its naval strength and disrupts the naval balance created by the Washington Treaty, the signatory countries may notify other signatory countries to increase their naval tonnage to maintain the original naval balance. It is now generally believed that Britain may invoke this "ladder clause" to increase its naval tonnage. Britain's building new ships is not a concern for the United States. However, if Japan also invokes the "ladder clause" to increase warships in order to maintain the ratio of three to five between the British and Japanese navies, the situation in which the United States is placed will inevitably be greatly difficult. The U.S. naval shipyard is now doing its best to build, and the government cannot add new ships. On the other hand, some Japanese shipbuilding plants still have ample capacity to accept new orders. If Japan were to increase the construction of new ships, the United States would have to change its naval arsenal into a wartime organization. For example, the Boston Shipyard, which has been closed for a long time, may as well reopen and build new ships. However, if this policy is adopted, the U.S. Navy Department must take into account several practical difficulties, while Japan can add new ships based only on its peacetime shipbuilding capabilities. Compared with the two, the United States cannot avoid being overshadowed. This is why the U.S. Navy is worried. (29th Day Havas Dispatch)</p>
<h3>German Shipyards Speed Up the Construction of New Ships. Six Submarines Already Built</h3>
<p>(Berlin) The German government recently announced the construction of eleven 250-ton submarines. This is part of the new shipbuilding program of the Navy, and other warships must also be built. German shipyards, such as the Blombus factory in Hamburg, the Xuege factory in East Prussia, and the Ergang shipbuilding factory, are extremely busy. In addition, the authorities are developing maritime aviation along the lower reaches of the Kiel River. The number of seaplanes recently stationed along the Baltic Sea coast from Flensburg to Stettin has greatly increased. (30th Day Havas)</p>
<p>(London) According to an article signed by the foreign telecommunications editor of the Daily News, six of Germany's twelve new submarines have already been built and are ready to start practicing. (30th Day National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) There is no panic here about Germany's building twelve submarines, each weighing 250 tons. Several parties regard this submarine as too small and limited in number to disturb France's main commercial routes in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, but it is sufficient to harm British commerce in the North Sea, the English Channel, and the Baltic Sea. France's opposition to Germany's unilateral denial of the Treaty of Versailles is not relaxed because of this. Germany is now building small submarines, and it can build larger ones in the future. The different attitudes of Britain and France towards the use of submarines have complicated the situation with Germany, because France regards submarines as weapons of self-defense. (29th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Rome) The Italian Daily News published an article today saying that Germany's 1935-36 naval program is three times larger than last year, with a total of 100,000 tons. The number of ships is also much larger than the number limited by the treaty, exceeding the British naval plan. According to the news obtained by the Paris correspondent, Germany's naval program for 1935-36 is two battleships, each of 20,000 tons, two cruisers, each of 9,000 tons to 10,000 tons, another cruiser of 6,000 tons, sixteen destroyers, each of 1,400 tons, and ten small warships, each of 800 tons. And the submarines that Germany wants to build, each between 400 tons and 500 tons, will be no less than twelve. The report also said that Germany's new battleships will be equipped with nine 11-inch guns and will have a speed of 32 knots and can be built before 1938. The cruisers will be equipped with nine 7.5-inch guns and will be built in May and June of this year and can also be built before the end of 1937. Four destroyers were built in Kiel last year, and another five are currently being built. Germany has secretly manufactured diesel engines, which have now been built and can be used for twelve submarines, each weighing 250 tons. The report estimates that Germany's naval power will have 166,000 tons by 1938, excluding submarines. (30th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>

After a long talk yesterday between French Foreign Minister Laval and Russian Ambassador Potemkin, the wording of the terms has been agreed. The Russian Ambassador has also reported to Moscow for a decision. According to its content, the principle of automatic mutual assistance does not conflict with the articles of the League of Nations Covenant and the Locarno Treaty. However, the signatory countries still retain considerable freedom to decide. Therefore, the so-called automatic assistance is limited. (30th Day National News Agency Dispatch)</p>
<p>(Paris) French Foreign Minister Laval and Russian Ambassador Potemkin have agreed on the details of the Franco-Russian Mutual Assistance Agreement after a two-and-a-half-hour meeting today.

The content of the agreement has not yet been announced, but judging from the name, the two countries should assist each other in certain situations. It is now believed that the agreement is divided into two parts: (1) Asking the League of Nations Administrative Council to reiterate and strengthen Articles 10, 16, and 17 of the League of Nations Covenant. (2) Stipulating the obligations of mutual assistance between France and Russia under these provisions. (29th Day Reuters Dispatch)</p>
<h3>Soviet Russian Army Vice Minister Announces German Military Strength: Still Capable After Attacking France</h3>
<p>(Moscow) Germany is capable of deploying a large army to attack France within hours, while still having the capacity to deal with other countries. This startling statement regarding the unstable situation in Europe was made today by the Soviet Russian Deputy People's Commissar for Military Affairs, Duke Tifsky, on the eve of the signing of the Franco-Soviet military agreement. Duke also stated that his remarks were based on reliable statistics regarding Germany's increased military strength. By this summer, Germany's military strength will be equal to that of Soviet Russia. Germany's regular army will have 849,000 men, in addition to 9,000,000 secret forces, including stormtroopers, border guards, and police. Germany already has 3,700 military aircraft, and factories are now extending working hours to rush production, capable of producing fifteen aircraft per day. Duke further discussed the possibility of a German attack on France, stating that attacking military units can all fight independently, and their staff headquarters are almost equivalent to wartime staff headquarters. Duke listed the forces participating in the offensive as follows: (1) Air Force: No less than 1,500 aircraft are currently prepared for independent operations. (2) Motorcade: One motorized division and four mechanized mixed brigades. (3) Cavalry: Five cavalry divisions. (4) Infantry: The First Army Corps, transported by motor vehicles, consists of approximately 150,000 men, comprising fifteen divisions. To ensure rapid march, each division is equipped with a transport team, each with 650 passenger cars, 6,700 trucks, and 1,200 motorcycles. Therefore, the German commander can transport fifteen divisions to distant areas without difficulty. In the coming years, the Nazi Party will definitely develop offensive forces on a large scale, especially the air force, motorcade, and submarines. Even the current military force, its strength already exceeds the entire peacetime French army. (30th National Telegram)</p>

Therefore, those who bear arms should fulfill their duties to defend the country. (30th National Telegram)</p>
<h3>Germany Borrows Funds from Britain and America to Purchase Raw Materials and Reorganize Armaments</h3>
<p>(Paris) The Business Report stated that Germany urgently needs to borrow large sums of money from foreign countries in order to purchase raw materials for rearmament. "A major bank in Berlin is contacting banks in London and New York on behalf of the German government, intending to borrow funds by mortgaging foreign securities held by the German people. If this loan is successful, Germany's active debt of 1,300,000,000 marks can be reorganized, and the 900,000,000 marks of insufficient international trade offsets can also be compensated. However, the New York banking industry denies this. Even American government officials stated that, according to the Johnson Act, any country that does not repay its debts to the United States cannot borrow in the United States. It is hoped that London banks will also adopt the same attitude." (30th Havas Telegram)</p>

On the opening day of the conference, Chairman Schickmann sent a telegram to the German leader Hitler, stating that the International Film Conference is organized by representatives from twenty-three countries. Taking this opportunity to start work in the German capital, we respectfully pay our respects to the German leader, deeply knowing the greatness of the cultural mission undertaken by the leader, hence the convocation of this conference, whose task is to consolidate the unity between countries. When the conference opened today, Schickmann read Hitler's reply telegram, stating, "I have received the congratulatory telegram from the International Film Conference, and I am extremely grateful. I warmly welcome the foreign representatives of the conference and hope that they can take this opportunity to further understand Germany, and wish that the noble mission of the film industry in culture will be further developed through the efforts of the conference, so as to promote mutual relations between countries and achieve the goals eagerly expected by all countries. What is this goal? It is to promote artistic success through friendly competition. I hold this hope, so I wish the conference success." The Film News and Criticism Committee passed a resolution, confirming that the mission of the film industry is to promote international sympathy and friendship, and requesting that the press of all countries publish as much discussion of international film issues as possible to help the film industry complete this mission. Furthermore, the influence of films on the thoughts and feelings of various countries has become a recognized fact. Therefore, the conference requested that the world's press refuse to discuss any films that cause international misunderstanding and thus endanger world peace. The conference also advocated the establishment of an International Technical Film News Bureau, using this as a center to provide film knowledge in various languages and illustrations. The bureau should also be responsible for exchanging film news from various countries. (29th National Telegram)</p>

<h3>US-Mexico Negotiations Conclude Successfully; Silver Policy Proceeding Cautiously; US Treasury Secretary Says No Announcement on Silver Prices</h3>
<p>(Washington) Treasury Secretary Morgenthau stated today that his talks with Mexican representatives on the silver issue have now concluded, and both sides are satisfied with the talks. Morgenthau declined to announce the content of the talks. At the same time, Morgenthau stated that no announcement will be made tonight regarding increasing domestic silver prices. The Treasury Department is now carefully maintaining its silver plan. Today, because world silver prices are lower than domestic prices, the Treasury Department remains silent. Those related to silver have various speculations about the government's future actions, but official circles have made no indications. Some people on Wall Street said that the Treasury Department will proceed slowly, not immediately raising the bank to $1.29, in order to avoid disrupting the 1933 Silver International Agreement. But others also believe that the government may immediately raise silver prices to $1.29, because this move is not as disturbing as gradually increasing prices. The current situation is very uncertain. However, there is an indication that now that the US-Mexico talks have ended, the United States should take concrete action. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<p>(Washington) After two important meetings on the government's silver policy, Treasury Secretary Morgenthau issued his only definite statement tonight, saying, "There will be no announcement on the silver issue tonight." Morgenthau's first meeting was with leaders of the Congressional Silver Faction, attended by important Treasury Department officials. Afterward, the Treasury Secretary and his advisors met with Mexican representatives. It is reported that Treasury Department officials proposed several measures to Mexican Ambassador Rossi and Mexican Finance Ministry Envoy Lopez in order to correct the adverse consequences of the United States' purchase of silver for Mexico. After the meeting, the Treasury Department indicated that there would be new developments in the silver issue soon. Therefore, people generally hoped that the Treasury Secretary would make an announcement immediately. However, the Treasury Secretary only made the above statement. (25th National Telegram)</p>

Another aircraft, coming from Sarburgun, flew over the fortified area of ​​Watterns. (29th Reuters Telegram)</p>
<h3>France Renews Air Force; Three-Year Plan Proceeding Quickly</h3>
<p>(Paris) According to a responsible person speaking to the press recently, the French Air Force will be completely renewed by the end of 1935. Because of foreign events, coming one after another, France is forced to do this, and has to speed up the three-year plan to renew the air force, which was drafted at the end of 1933, so that the plan scheduled to be completed in the spring of 1937 will be completed earlier in the winter of 1935 and 1936. In the current situation, we should strive to advance and engage in construction. However, excessive haste may cause harm. Therefore, while we strive to renew the aviation industry and ensure its completeness, we should also have a considerable limit. As for how the future air force policy will be decided, it should be determined according to environmental changes. But we have prepared to conduct preliminary research on this and will have it reviewed by the Supreme National Defense Committee. (30th Havas Telegram)</p>

<h3>Japan Plans to Implement Trade Defense Law; Deals with Countries that Repel Japanese Goods, First Negotiates with Canada</h3>
<p>(Tokyo) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs held a trade deliberation council on the 25th and decided to apply the Trade Defense Law to countries that repel Japanese goods. The first task now is to adjust trade with Canada. However, Foreign Minister Hirota will wait for the new Canadian Ambassador to China, Kato Sotaro, to take office before instructing him to begin negotiations, demanding the abolition of its illegal system of dumping duties. If there is no sincerity, the Trade Defense Law will be implemented. (30th Japan United Press Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) Last year, German-Japanese trade was extremely one-sided. The foreign affairs authorities are considering launching the Trade Defense Law. (30th Dentsu Telegram)</p>
<p>(Tokyo) The Hanshang Deliberation Council's decision to launch the Trade Defense Law indicates that Japan is changing its traditional unconditional free trade policy and turning to a reciprocal free policy. The Ministry of Foreign Affairs plans to set up two special committees on import control and Canadian trade adjustment this week, following the following guidelines to avoid causing a tariff war, namely: (1) When vigorously launching the Trade Defense Law, even if it is implemented by private groups, tariffs, triangular trade, etc. will be used. (2) Import restrictions will only be imposed on countries that restrict Japanese goods, and within the scope of the opponent's restriction policies. (3) Although theoretically it is called import control, it should be developed to trade management. However, in fact, countries that cannot settle foreign exchange, such as Germany, the Soviet Union, Central and South America, and the Near East, are mostly implementing it. Therefore, Japan should implement it to the extent of the policies of countries such as Britain, the United States, and France, and within the scope of reciprocal most-favored-nation treatment.

<h3>Recent Developments in Polish Diplomacy</h3>
<p>(Polish News Agency) In an article written by a famous Polish journalist, it is said that Poland's foreign policy has eliminated the old European concept of dividing Europe into two categories: governing countries and governed countries. The journalist further stated that there is no major difference between Polish and French foreign policies. Poland's diplomatic actions are no different from the spirit of the Rome and London agreements. Their purpose is to resolve all conflicts on the basis of international equality.</p>
<p>Poland's attitude towards the Eastern European Pact is not enough to represent Poland's attitude towards France. Some French people believe that Poland's attitude towards the Eastern European Pact is Poland's attitude towards France. If the purpose of the Eastern European Pact is to consolidate peace in Eastern Europe, then Poland, Germany, Soviet Russia, the Balkan countries, Romania, and France should all join. But in fact, Poland was not invited to participate in the discussion before Poland directly concluded agreements with neighboring countries.</p>
<p>The new turning point in the European situation: after the relationship between Poland and Germany and Russia was determined, the situation in Europe changed greatly. In the past, Europe was divided into two major regions: East and West. Poland not only concluded non-aggression treaties with Germany and Russia, but also helped the Baltic countries conclude similar treaties with Soviet Russia. Poland also helped resolve the conflict between Soviet Russia and Romania. Because Poland has the above-mentioned successes, there is no need for the Eastern European Pact. Before Poland concludes treaties with neighboring countries, this pact may be successful. In short, in fact, Poland has already concluded treaties with Germany and Russia, and naturally there is no need to join any treaties that endanger the work that Poland has already successfully completed.</p>
<p>Poland should cooperate to restore the relationship between Germany and France to normal. Poland extremely hopes to restore the relationship between Poland's neighboring countries and third parties to normal, especially the relationship between Germany and France. On this point, the Polish people have a consensus. Any misunderstandings that accidentally occur between Paris and Warsaw can be resolved in a short period of time.</p>
<h3>Poland's New Constitution</h3>
<p>"Polish News Agency" The Polish Parliament is currently exercising a certain special legislative power, namely, rewriting Poland's new constitution. The Constitutional Committee of the Upper House completed the revision of the draft adopted on January 26, 1934, on January 11. If this amendment can be passed in the plenary session of the Upper House, it will be transmitted to the Lower House.</p>
<p>The fundamental essence of the new constitution—Regarding electoralism, the new constitution preserves it in its entirety. The legislative and autonomous bodies, from the Upper House, the Lower House, to the municipal councils in small towns, must adopt an election system and be elected by the people in the future. The elections are universal, secret, direct, and equal.</p>
<p>Controlling the government—The power to control the government and the power to impeach are indispensable essences of a republican political system. The new constitution of Poland maintains this essence. The Lower House can still control the government, but its powers are slightly limited.</p>
<p>Increased freedom for the people—The new constitution still guarantees the people's freedom, such as freedom of assembly, freedom of publication, the inviolability of homes without cause, the secrecy of communications, and the freedom from being punished by non-courts. All the democratic republics during the Washington era, the French Revolution, and the abolition of the imperial system are included in the new constitution.</p>
<p>Separation of powers—The new constitution clearly defines the powers of the various departments of the government, namely, the executive, legislative, and judicial departments. The new constitution also has the so-called "the state is the public property of the people," which is even more sufficient to protect republicanism.</p>
<p>The powers of the President—The new constitution intends to increase the powers of the President. The President can appoint the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, has the power to convene and dissolve Parliament, can appoint the President of the Supreme Court and the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and has the power to veto legislation. The President is elected from two candidates, one designated by the former President, and one elected by the Electoral College composed of the speakers of the Upper and Lower Houses, the Prime Minister of the Cabinet, the President of the Supreme Court, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, and 50 people's representatives elected by the Lower House and 22 people's representatives elected by the Upper House. After these two candidates are selected, the people vote to decide. If the person designated by the President is the same as the person elected by the Electoral College, then the general election by the people may not be held.</p>
<p>The President's actions must be countersigned by the government, and the government is responsible to Parliament. When the government agencies cannot continue to work, or when the government and the Lower House or other agencies have conflicts, the President has the power to arbitrate. In other words, the President is above all government agencies and must be the mediator of the government agencies, and has the power to resolve all disputes.</p>
<p>The President is the arbitrator—The legislators hope that in the future, all disputes can be easily resolved, so that the country will be more prosperous and the country will progress faster. The reason for giving the President this special power is that the President is elected by the people. The people naturally have absolute faith in the President. Since the people have absolute faith in him, this special power is of course needed in the republic, because in this way there can be no ineffective arbitration.</p>
<p>In short, based on the experience of the past few years, it is deeply felt that the President must be elected by the people, the President must be one with the cabinet, and the President must be given the special power of arbitration. In addition, Poland's new constitution can not only break the common customs of the world, but also implement the true republican name that is in line with the needs of the people.</p>

<h3>Japan Establishes a Twenty-Year Cotton Planting Plan in South Manchuria: Japan Currently Needs a Large Quantity of Cotton; Plans to Expand Annual Production to 150 Million Jin</h3>
<p>(Shenyang Correspondence) Cotton can not only be used to make yarn, cloth, and clothing, but also to manufacture explosives, holding an extremely important position in military applications. Currently, Japan needs 600 million jin of cotton annually, while the Northeast needs 150 million jin. Japan produces 50 million jin of cotton, Korea produces 50 million jin, and the Northeast produces 30 million jin. The shortfall is entirely dependent on India and the United States. Since the Russo-Japanese War, Japan has been advocating for cotton self-sufficiency as an absolute necessity. Planting cotton has been implemented in Korea, resulting in the current production of 50 million jin. Japan has even greater ambitions to expand cotton planting. The soil in South Manchuria is suitable for growing cotton. According to investigations by the Japan Cotton Company and the Cotton Association, the current planting area is 50,000 cho, with a production of 2.8 million jin. If developed according to a twenty-year plan, it can be increased to 300,000 cho, with a cotton production of 150 million jin. The Japan Cotton Company and the Cotton Association are currently handling the implementation. (Northeast News Agency)</p>
<h3>Hebei Provincial Government Strictly Prohibits the Private Smuggling of Silver: Provincial Government Promulgates Investigation and Prohibition Measures</h3>
<p>(Tianjin Correspondence) Since the price of silver has soared, silver has been flowing out of Tianjin. Therefore, the Bank of Communications and the Central Bank once held a meeting, requesting foreign banks to assist in preventing the outflow, and requesting the provincial authorities to issue regulations to prohibit the outflow, with the authorities assisting the customs and police in investigating and prohibiting it by land and sea, in order to prevent the overflow of silver and stabilize the financial situation. The provincial government promulgated nine measures for investigating and prohibiting the export of privately smuggled silver in this province on the 27th. These are attached as follows: (1) The amount of silver that passengers can carry out of the country is limited to a value of fifty yuan. (2) If passengers carry silver exceeding the above limit without holding an approved document, it will be regarded as smuggling. Once discovered, they will be punished in accordance with these measures. (3) In addition to the implementation of investigation and prohibition of smuggling silver exports by the customs and military police agencies of this province, people are also allowed to report and expose them to the customs and military police agencies at any time. (4) Those who seize smuggled silver or silver items for export, in addition to being investigated by the customs, should be handled in accordance with the reward measures originally set by the Ministry of Finance's Advisory No. 10650 of December 9, 23rd year. Those seized by military police agencies in this province should be punished and rewarded in accordance with the standards stipulated in these measures. (5) Silver coins or silver items seized for smuggling out of the country shall be sent to the relevant municipal or county bureau. In addition to confiscating the silver coins or silver items, a fine of double the amount smuggled shall be imposed, and the instigators shall be severely punished. (6) The confiscated silver or silver coins shall be rewarded according to the following percentages: A. If the seizure is made solely by the military police agencies of this province, 60% will be given for exceptional merit, and 40% will be given for ordinary merit. B. If the seizure is made by any agency in this province based on an informant's report, the person who made the seizure and the informant shall each receive 40%. The informant's name shall be kept confidential. (7) The fine of double the amount stipulated in Article 5 shall be added to the rewards for the relevant military police and informants in items A and B of Article 6, with the remainder confiscated. However, this does not apply to cases where smugglers escape and cannot be punished, or where smugglers are unable to pay the fine. (8) The Municipal and County Bureaus shall report the privately smuggled silver or silver items seized to the Finance Department, and also report to the Provincial Government for verification. (9) These measures will be implemented from the date of promulgation by the Provincial Government. (27th)</p>
<h3>Hong Guantao Discusses the Progress of Transportation in the Northwest</h3>
<p>The Longhai Railway Western Extension Plan</p>
<p>Although the Xi'an-Lanzhou-Xining Highway is still under construction, the Tongguan-Xi'an Railway was opened to traffic at the end of last year. From the first of this month, express trains can travel directly from Xuzhou to Xi'an, and the market is becoming increasingly prosperous. Business people and industrialists are going to inspect and prepare to invest, and the prospects for the Northwest are very promising. The revenue of the Longhai Railway has also been increasing rapidly, breaking past records. The Ministry of Railways has a plan to extend the railway. Hong Guantao, the agent and director of the Tongguan-Xi'an section of the Engineering Bureau, came to Beijing the other day to discuss this matter. According to Hong, the Longhai Western Extension Plan is as follows: The entire Longhai line was originally scheduled to be completed in five years, but due to the European War, the money could not continue to be invested. Later, internal wars had a great impact on the railway. However, many commentators believe that the fundamental reason for the poor business performance of the railway is that it has no seaport to the east and stops at Tongguan to the west. Since Vice-Minister Qian Mulin took charge of the railway, he has been determined to reorganize it and carry out seaport construction. At the same time, Minister Gu also borrowed funds in the midst of no other choice to complete the Tongguan-Xi'an section. The business of the Longhai Railway has gradually developed, and the situation in the Northwest has gradually changed. However, there are still 670-80 kilometers from Xi'an to Lanzhou, the construction is difficult and the cost is huge, so it is not easy to prepare. Last year, the Belgian Minister came to visit the west and praised the new Longhai construction and road conditions. He expressed that the Belgian side had the possibility of continuing investment. Since then, it has been heard that both Belgium and the Netherlands have been in contact with the Ministry of Railways, but this matter is quite complicated, and the international economic situation is not stable, so it may not be successful in a short period of time. However, the westward expansion of the Longhai seems to be imminent. The other day, I met Vice-Minister Zeng, who said that although it is very difficult for the Ministry to raise funds, it still plans to extend the railway to Baoji at least, and hopes to complete it within next year. After I return to Zhengzhou, in addition to immediately inviting bids to speed up the construction of the Xi'an-Xianyang section, with the aim of opening it to traffic at the end of the year, I will immediately send personnel to survey the Xianyang-Baoji route. Regarding the progress of the Xi'an-Chengdu route, Hong said that the Engineering Bureau previously suggested that the Baoji-Chengdu section should be built as a feeder line for the Longhai line, because the road from the Longhai line to Chengdu is the shortest, and both southern Shaanxi and northern Sichuan are rich areas. It is a misunderstanding that the outside world believes that the Baoji-Lanzhou section was abandoned in favor of the Baoji-Chengdu section. However, this line runs through the Qinling Mountains, and the project is extremely difficult. The Ministry of Railways decided to first conduct aerial surveys of the Qinling Mountains and only proceed if there is a way to cross the mountains.</p>
<h3>Three Bombing Cases Occur in Guangzhou</h3>
<p>Two Aboard Ships Along the Bund, One on Land; Five People Injured in Total; Perpetrators Escape</p>
<p>(Guangzhou Correspondence) Bandits in this city have been unusually active recently, and three bombing cases have occurred in prosperous areas in succession, which is truly shocking. The details are as follows: (1) The Lianxing ferry, which travels between Guangzhou and Gaoming, received several letters from bandits a few days ago, stating that they wanted 1,000 yuan to avoid danger, otherwise they would encounter accidents along the way. The shipowner regarded this as a trick of bandit intimidation and ignored it. On the evening of the 21st of this month, the Lianxing ferry docked on the Pearl River. Late that night, it departed from Guangzhou to return to Gaoming County. At 10:30 PM, when the passengers were arranging their bedding and preparing to sleep, a strange noise suddenly erupted next to the left corner of the main cabin. Thick smoke filled the area. The passengers thought it was a bomb explosion and ran away in a hurry, causing great chaos. Police officers on the shore also rushed to the scene upon hearing the sound. They saw that the cabin board at the site of the explosion had a large hole, about a foot wide. An elderly passenger, Hu Haobiao, was seriously injured in the bombing. A nearby passenger named Tan Fu also suffered minor injuries. (2) Xiguan Shiba Pu has always been a prosperous area. At about 8 PM on the evening of the 22nd, the night market began, and pedestrians were coming and going like shuttles. Customers flocked to the food stalls. A robust man came to eat at a restaurant called Heji Restaurant. After finishing his meal, he paid the bill and left, which was not unusual. Later, a shop assistant named Cui Xun was cleaning the chairs and tables when he noticed a roll of cigarette packets left on the table. He went forward to pick it up, and it exploded with a bang. Shrapnel flew everywhere. Cui's five fingers on his left hand were immediately blown off, and he fainted on the ground. The shop assistants were shocked. In addition to sending the injured to the municipal hospital for treatment, they also reported the case to the police station. According to the shopkeeper, the shop has always been stable in its operations, and has never received extortion letters from bandits. On the evening of the 22nd, military and police officers were inspecting passenger gun licenses in the vicinity. The bandit carrying the bomb probably heard the emergency news and was afraid of being searched, so he entered the shop to hide. When he finished eating, he did not dare to carry the bomb out again, so he secretly placed it on the table. The shop assistants did not notice, resulting in the explosion. (3) At about 8 PM on the evening of the 23rd, the Huaji ferry, which travels between Guangzhou and Nanhai Jiujiang Town, was moored next to the restaurant on the Bund when bandits sneaked in and detonated a time-delay bomb. The explosion injured two passengers, Li Yaoyang and Mo Songdong. At that time, passengers fled in a panic, and there were also many losses. Later, military and police arrived at the scene, but the bandits were gone. In total, three cases of bomb attacks causing injuries have occurred in this city since the evening of the 21st, which is also a rare event. (24th)</p>
<h3>Songjiang: Victim Fights with Robbers and Gets Injured</h3>
<p>Yao Xiulin (49 years old) and Yao Xiugen (37 years old), brothers, farmers from No. 4 Tu, Huayang Bridge South Village outside the East Gate, lived together in the same house. On the night of the 29th, more than a dozen robbers broke open the front door and entered the house to rob. The Yao brothers were known for their strength. Seeing that the robbers were unarmed, they fought with them. However, because they were outnumbered, they were hit on the head with wooden sticks, and their skulls were said to have been cracked. The injuries were extremely serious. The Yao brothers are now being treated at the Rongcheng Hospital.</p>
<h3>Jiading: Policeman Drowns While Arresting Gamblers</h3>
<p>In Yuanjiazhai, Caozheng Township, Xinmu Bridge South, District 1, there was a man named Hu Alin who secretly set up a small tea house and gathered people to gamble and take commissions. On the 29th of last month, the County Public Security Bureau received a report that Hu had invited people to gamble heavily that night, so they sent police officers to arrest them. When they arrived, they were in the midst of shouting and gambling. At the sound of "Police are here!" the gamblers fled in all directions. The police, because there were so many gamblers, fired shots as a warning. Seventeen people were arrested on the spot and taken to the bureau overnight. Among the gamblers was Pan Maogou, 27 years old, a tailor. At the sound of the gun, he ran in fright, fell into the river, and drowned. The next morning, his body floated up in the river next to his house. His wife and mother were in extreme grief. Guan Pan was the only son of the third room, and his family was poor. His wife and mother went to the county government to cry and make a scene, and were persuaded to return by county government officials after repeated consolation. On the 30th, a county trial official led a group of people to conduct an autopsy.</p>
<h3>Suzhou: Water and Land Police Chase and Capture Lake Bandits</h3>
<p>A water and land police team stationed near Bailong Bridge, Shengze Township, Wujiang County, received a report on the afternoon of the 29th that more than 30 lake bandits had been discovered in the Xiangshandou area, robbing cargo ships. They had robbed more than 1,000 yuan in silver and goods. After receiving the report, the team immediately dispatched troops and set out to encircle and suppress the bandits. They captured one bandit ship and arrested five bandits: Wang Shunxiang, Wang Jinshan, Shen Yiyan, Li Xiuyou, and Wang Furong. They also seized one quick-firing gun and stolen silver. They were escorted to Shengze that night and handed over to the Wujiang County Government for interrogation yesterday (30th). They will be transferred to the Second District Water Public Security Bureau for further investigation. Furthermore, the home of Yan Zhiying in Dongshan, Dongting, was robbed at dawn the other day by bandits armed with weapons. They robbed silver and clothing worth about 200 yuan.</p>
<h3>Planning to Widen Streets Outside Tuokuan Gate</h3>
<p>The Wuxian Construction Bureau is carrying out the widening of the city's major trunk roads in stages.

<h3>Zhang Guangyi and Ms. Yan's Love Letters</h3>
<p>Regarding the case of the engagement dispute between Zhang Guangyi, an old lawyer in front of the old school in Suzhou, and Yan Huifang, both parties now have no hope of reconciliation. Ms. Yan, impatient with the delay, yesterday entrusted her legal counsel, lawyer Zhu Chengyue, to file a petition with the Wuxian District Court to first apply for mediation. Of all nine love letters from Zhang Guangyi to Ms. Yan, apart from the two pairs that have already been published, there are still seven that have not been disclosed, which has attracted much attention and eager anticipation. However, the reporter was unwilling to hinder the reconciliation process by fully disclosing them. Now that reconciliation is hopeless and the matter has progressed to seeking a legal solution, the general content of the seven pairs of love letters is excerpted as follows. The content is mostly domestic talk, and the intensity of the affection is comparable to the first and second letters. It includes phrases such as, "Received a letter, with two items inside, just like twins, reading it makes me very happy, very grateful, and very comfortable." "My dear sister, please write a letter, post it and send it to me, because I have been looking forward to your letter, my neck is stretched long." "Your letter is not written too little, but I still find it too little." Mr. Zhang Guangyi once suffered from spitting blood and wrote to inform Ms. Yan. Yan then also wrote back, with the gist of it saying that since you were spitting blood, I did not sleep all night, and so on. "What are you thinking, let me take a wild guess, my sister must think of me as (1) still alright, but old, (2) still satisfactory in temperament, but how many years can I live, (3) how many more years can we be together, right? I think my sister will scold me for being 'sunstruck'. I put your letter under my pillow and take it out to read at night, once, twice, three times." "My dear sister is considerate of me and asked the servant to share a room with me, but I am not very willing. After spring and summer, I will have to trouble you to worry." "You and your aunt went to various temples to burn incense and communicate with the gods. What did you say to the gods? Please tell me. I am a tiger, and I plan to go to Yuanmiao Temple to burn incense to the stars, bow four times, and pray to the gods for harmony and peace." In the seven letters, he addresses her as "Virtuous Sister," "Beloved Sister," "Dearest Sister," and various forms of "Sister." In the eighth pair of letters, the affection is still very strong. In the ninth letter, there are phrases such as, "My heart is full of depression, I have many things to talk to you about." The date of the last letter is the 26th day of the first month. After that, there were no more letters.</p>
<h3>Wuxi: Beijing-Wuxi-Wujin Silk Industry Petition to the Capital</h3>
<p>The Nanjing-Wuxi-Wujin Silk Fabric Trade Association, because the Hangzhou Municipal Silk Industry Market has newly formulated measures for collecting ★★★★★★ goods on behalf of customers, which make things difficult for merchants, monopolize profits, and affect the industry, has not only requested the Nanjing Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Wuxi and Wujin County Chambers of Commerce to telegraph the Ministry of Industry of the Executive Yuan to order a halt, but also convened colleagues from the three regions to discuss and determine resolute resistance measures at the Wuxi Silk Fabric Trade Association. They immediately elected Jin Hongwen, Ruifenghe, and Tianfu from Nanjing, Jiang Jinghai, Mu Rongqing, and Qian Baoya from Wuxi, and Li Shounan and Tu Changsheng from Wujin as representatives of the Beijing-Wuxi-Wujin Trade Association. Today (the 1st) they will go to Beijing to petition the Executive Yuan, seeking to order the Hangzhou Municipal Government to immediately cancel these measures in order to protect merchants. The original petition is as follows: According to the association's members, there have long been two public offices, Jiangsu and Yu Ning, set up in Hangzhou, specifically for colleagues to stay when they go to Hangzhou to purchase goods. They have a long history, are trustworthy, and both hosts and guests are at peace, without any disputes. However, the Hangzhou Municipal Silk Industry Market suddenly formulated measures for public offices to register and collect goods on behalf of customers, and deceptively requested the municipal government to approve and announce them. Any public office collecting goods on behalf of customers must first apply for registration and pay a deposit of 500 yuan before they can enter the market to collect goods. Furthermore, when a public office collects goods for customers, it must also submit a written report in advance. In addition to paying the market service fee as required, an additional equipment fee of two dimes per bolt of silver dollar must be paid. This seems to be only for restricting public offices that collect goods on behalf of customers. However, the Jiangsu and Yu Ning public offices set up in Hangzhou by Nanjing, Wuxi, Wujin, and other places are all free associations that provide accommodation for colleagues. Whenever merchants arrive in Hangzhou, they have always relied on cash transactions, allowing them to directly collect goods from machine households at any time. The public offices do not act on behalf of customers, and machine households do not exploit them. Buying and selling are convenient. It is difficult to suddenly change the system. If we must also follow the measures stipulated in the regulations, such as paying a deposit and market service equipment fees, regardless of the capital operation of merchants, at a time when foreign goods are being dumped, we must seek to reduce costs in order to resist them. To add to the burden will only result in customers having to pay the full cash price of all goods and be issued promissory notes by the market is obviously profiteering and exploiting the machine households. In the future, the demands will be difficult to satisfy, and the malpractices will be countless. Therefore, the establishment of this market is not enough to balance the market, and the measures stipulated are solely for manipulating profits. In fact, they are detrimental to both merchants and machine households. It is proposed to request the Ministry to investigate and stop it. This matter concerns the newly established market, which makes things difficult for merchants, monopolizes profits, and hinders industry and commerce. Therefore, this petition is respectfully submitted, respectfully requesting a reply and swiftly ordering an investigation and a halt, so as to avoid monopolization and ensure commercial security. This would be a great kindness.</p>
<h3>The Whole City Goes Wild to Watch the Grand Gathering</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the 28th day of the third month of the lunar calendar, the annual incense pilgrimage, with the custom of the seven temples paying respects to the Eastern Peak. The grand scale of this year's competition, with each temple vying to outdo the others, was unprecedented. Day and night, the various associations displayed their unique features, including "Consort Yang Emerging from the Bath," "Grass Skirt Dance," "Ruan Lingyu," "Divorce in the Court," "The Scandal of the French Palace," and other new and old dramas, numbering no less than several hundred. Everything was available. It is impossible to record them all. They were all portrayed by young girls, singing all the way in gorgeous costumes. The scale of the project was unprecedented. From morning to late at night, men, women, young, and old, the whole city went wild. Inside and outside the city, people crowded like mountains and seas, surging like a tide, squeezing until no water could pass through. Around the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway, those who came from other places to see the gathering were even more crowded. All the large and small hotels were fully booked two days ago. Later arrivals had nowhere to stay. Various newspapers also competed to publish special editions for viewing the gathering, carrying news from the event. The *Xinwen Ribao* also discussed the history of Wang Qiqin, who built the city during the Ming Dynasty and shot at Japanese pirates. The public security authorities, fearing that crowds would cause trouble, specifically designated that all associations must walk on the newly widened Xinsheng Road. Inside and outside the city, double guards were added, and the Inspectorate's Detective Team and all the police cadets from the Chief Police Refresher School were dispatched to patrol with the chiefs of the various sub-bureaus in order to maintain order. Two temporary pontoon bridges were specially built next to the drawbridge outside the West Gate to divert pedestrians. All factories and theaters in the city were closed. Other shops, vehicles, and vendors all profited a hundredfold. The east and west main streets in the city, being the necessary routes for all associations, had all storefronts and residents' doors rented out temporarily to watch the gathering. The daily rent for each storefront ranged from five to over ten yuan. The grandeur was truly unprecedented.</p>

<h3>Haimen: Adulterer and Adulteress Murder Husband</h3>
<p>Huang Zulin, a villager in Xu Village, south of Huilong Town, Qidong, is 36 years old. He married the daughter of Zhang Shaoshan. Their relationship was initially harmonious. However, Zhang recently became involved in an adulterous affair with a neighbor, Ni Baolin, and they were very close. One afternoon, around 8 p.m., Huang bought a bottle of liquor in Huilong Town and returned home to drink alone, becoming very drunk and falling asleep. That night, Ni went to meet her again. As Huang was at home, it was inconvenient. Therefore, he conspired with Zhang to strangle him to death with a hemp rope while Huang was asleep. The next day, Zhang claimed that Huang had hanged himself, hoping to deceive others. Neighbors found the details of the matter suspicious and questioned her in various ways, finally learning the truth. They reported to the county government for investigation yesterday.</p>
<h3>Old Couple Strangles Their Own Son to Death</h3>
<p>There is a Xia Zhongren in Beihou Street, Zhong'an Town, Fourth District, Qidong, who mainly works as a farmer. He is over 40 years old. He has a son named Qingliang, who is now 21 years old. Qingliang's behavior has been improper and he often associates with hooligans. Although his father has repeatedly rebuked him, he still does not repent. The other day, he stole farming tools from a neighbor's house. When Zhongren learned of this, he was very angry. That night, while Qingliang was sound asleep, he called his wife, Lu, and strangled Qingliang to death. They wrapped him in a reed mat and buried him behind the house. Yesterday, neighbor Lu Xianwen found out the truth and reported it to the county government. Wang Cheng, the presiding judge, went with the bailiffs and examiners to exhume the body. It was confirmed that he had been strangled to death before burial. Xia Zhongren and Lu were both taken to the county jail.</p>
<h3>Nantong: Li Guanyintang Town Looted</h3>

<h3>Fuzhou: High Court President Personally Inspects Prisons</h3>
<p>Tong Hangshi, president of the Higher Court, personally went to southern Fujian to inspect in order to rectify the judiciary. He passed through Putian, Jinjiang, Tongan, and Xiamen to reach Zhangzhou, and returned to the province from Zhangzhou the day before yesterday. It is said that the impression gained from this inspection is that the architecture of the Second Prison of Zhangzhou is the best, with workshops and a complete scale. The second best is Putian. The smallest and most dilapidated are Jinjiang and Xiamen. Now, President Tong, in order to improve the sanitation of the prisoners, has consulted with Xiamen Mayor Wang Guipan and borrowed the old site of the former Siming County Government for renovation and repair to serve as a prison. At the same time, in order to thoroughly improve judicial administration, in addition to urging officials to clear up backlog cases within a time limit, all the accumulated malpractices in the judicial circles of Fujian Province will be reformed with all efforts. A strict assessment will be made of the staff in the court to determine promotions and demotions. It is said that Chuan Yan, the chief secretary of the court's document section, has served in the court for more than 20 years, is diligent and honest, and is admired by everyone in the court. He has been internally designated for promotion. Hu Yifan and others among the clerks have also been reported to the Ministry to be assigned as apprentice secretaries.</p>

<h3>The Difficult "Fourth Bottom" Period Passed Safely Yesterday; Ministry of Finance Instructs the Money Industry Association to Jointly Assume Responsibility for Aiding Industry and Commerce</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the "Fourth Bottom" period for the industrial and commercial sectors. As various parties had already made proper arrangements beforehand, yesterday, apart from the silver and money industry's receipts and deliveries being slightly busy from the morning, everything else was stable and passed peacefully. Industry and commerce, and the money industry generally stated that this period passed safely, and that each industry will have sufficient time in the future to gradually improve its own environment.</p>
<p>All Industries Have Safely and Steadily Passed</p>
<p>Although Shanghai's various industrial and commercial sectors are under a general economic downturn, they have safely and steadily passed the "Fourth Bottom" period. This is truly thanks to the Central, China, and Communications Banks for organizing interbank lending. Because the three banks organized interbank lending during a time of extremely tight credit, all silver and money industries were able to apply for collateralized borrowing using government bond treasury bills. After the silver and money industry obtained interbank lending to adjust, they did not pursue the industrial and commercial enterprises, indirectly rescuing industry and commerce. As for the money industry's long-term extension of the "Fourth Bottom," it is said that the total amount should be more than 20 to 30 million yuan.</p>
<p>Money Industry Ordered to Handle Jointly</p>
<p>The Shanghai Money Industry Association received an instruction from the Ministry of Finance yesterday, Hu Qian Zi No. 22, which stated: "This Ministry has already stipulated ten principles for granting loans in order to aid Shanghai's industry and commerce, and has separately ordered the Central, China, and Communications Banks and the Shanghai Banking Association to handle them jointly. The money houses of your association, as financial institutions, should jointly assume the responsibility of rescue. The ten principles for granting loans are copied and issued separately, ordering your association to comply and handle them jointly with other banks and associations. This order is issued on April 30, 1935."</p>
<p>Citizens' Federation Hopes for Speedy Loan Release</p>
<p>The Shanghai First Special District Citizens' Federation submitted a petition to Minister Kong of the Ministry of Finance yesterday, stating: "Petition for the matter of requesting. We, the people, note that your Ministry has ordered the Central, China, and Communications Banks to jointly organize a mortgage loan of 15 million yuan and a small industrial and commercial credit loan of 5 million yuan together with the Banking Association. Your Excellency's concern for the people's suffering is admirable, and industry and commerce applaud with joy. However, Shanghai's industry and commerce have been facing extremely tight credit in recent years, and there has been a situation of being stretched thin from time to time. We hope that the loan will be implemented as soon as possible, like looking forward to rain in a great drought. The actual situation today is that not only are small industrial and commercial enterprises struggling, but even large businesses with many customers are often closing due to lack of funds. This is already a common occurrence. Now, the members of various district branches of the association are requesting relief, and we have specially dispatched representatives Shen Tianxin, Hu Fengxiang, and Zhang Yichen to visit Your Excellency, begging you to order the two banks to work with the Banking Association to quickly handle this loan, so that industry and commerce will have relief funds, and the suffering will be alleviated. This would be a great public service." Based on the resolution of the Sixth Standing Committee, the three representatives, Shen Tianxin, Hu Fengxiang, and Zhang Yichen, met with Mr. Chen Guangfu, chairman of the Banking Association, yesterday to request the early implementation of credit loans. Mr. Chen stated that the Banking Association has already selected two members, Wang Yansong and Ye Fuji, from the six members of the subcommittee to contact the Central Bank regarding the organization methods of the loan syndicate, and the Banking Association has already sent a letter to the Central Bank, stating everything. They are now awaiting the Central Bank to schedule a meeting, and so on.</p>

The text is accompanied by illustrations to help students' interest; (6) In addition to teaching students to read and instilling civic knowledge, this book specially includes an arithmetic unit at the end to teach students to recognize numerical symbols and learn the simplest four arithmetic operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division; (7) This book is compiled and printed based on the needs of the Shanghai municipal environment and with reference to various popular readers. If there are any unsuitable points, they will be revised after trial use; (8) A teaching manual has been compiled separately for this book for teachers' reference.</p>
<p>Establishment of Numerous Schools</p>
<p>In addition to the ten literacy schools that the committee has already prepared to set up in the slum area of the Confucian Temple and the Jiangwan experimental area, which will begin classes today, other districts will also begin preparing to establish literacy schools, totaling 200 schools. Each school will have one teacher. Teachers for all schools will begin registration today, which will close on the 6th. After a scheduled examination, those admitted will be responsible for investigating the situation of illiterate citizens in the designated areas, for about three weeks. After the investigation is completed, they will receive three weeks of training, and then recruit illiterate citizens and start classes. During the investigation period, because there are many residents in this city, in addition to the investigation by the admitted teachers, household registration police, faculty and staff of nearby schools, and older students will assist in the process, so that it can be completed as scheduled.</p>
<p>Popularization Throughout the City</p>
<p>Regarding the concession area, there are also a considerable number of residents, and there must be quite a few illiterate people. Therefore, the committee has paid close attention to the literacy education of illiterate residents in the concession area. However, because this matter is still in its initial stage, and the situation in the concession area is more complex, it may be difficult to carry out for the time being. Therefore, it is planned to negotiate with the concession authorities on literacy campaign methods after the various districts in the Chinese area have achieved effective results, so that all residents in this city can be literate, so as to achieve the goal of completely eradicating illiteracy.</p>
<p>Mayor's Broadcast</p>
<p>Shanghai News Agency reports that Mayor Wu, in order to promote literacy education, has specifically scheduled to broadcast a speech from 6:00 PM to 7:00 PM today at the Shanghai Radio Station of the Ministry of Communications, No. 137 Sassoon House. It is reported that the International Telecommunications Bureau of the Ministry of Communications has issued a notice to all radio stations in the city to rebroadcast Mayor Wu's speech on that radio station every 40 kilocycles. All other radio stations will suspend broadcasting any programs. The frequency of Shanghai Radio Station is 200. The Federation of Labor Unions has also requested Cheng Haifeng to speak on the Guohua Radio Station at 10:00 AM, Bishop at 10:00 AM on the Oriental Radio Station, Zhu Xuefan at 4:00 PM on the Zhongxi Radio Station, and Li Mengnan at 11:00 AM on the Mingyuan Radio Station.</p>
<h3>City Party Headquarters Establishes Literacy Education Promotion Association</h3>
<p>Tong Xingbai and Five Others Appointed as Directors, Held First Discussion Yesterday</p>
<p>The Kuomintang News Agency reports that everyone knows that education in our country is not widespread, and the small numbers are truly alarming. Internal turmoil and external troubles over the past few decades have all stemmed from this. Seeking the revival of the nation and the country must start with the popularization of education, which has become an extremely obvious and self-evident truth. The Kuomintang understands this drawback and therefore has the literacy campaign,</p>
<p>Listed as One of the Seven Major Movements. However, in recent years, natural disasters and man-made disasters, internal and external troubles, have arisen one after another. The central and local authorities have no time to worry about the people's livelihood, let alone empty coffers and the inability to rebuild everything. Recently, Mayor Wu of this city and the education authorities, with great determination, allocated huge amounts of treasury funds and planned for several months to formulate methods to eliminate illiteracy in the entire city. The Literacy Education Committee was established some time ago to take full responsibility, and the opening ceremony of the publicity week and the inauguration of the service corps leaders are scheduled to be held today. The City Party Headquarters believes that this great work has always been what it has hoped for. Now that it has finally arrived, it is undoubtedly its unshirkable responsibility. It is not enough to just give verbal publicity; there must be practical actions to lead the people and assist the government in promoting it in order to complete this important task. Therefore, at the 169th regular meeting on the 15th of last month, the Standing Committee,</p>
<p>Proposed Organizational Principles: (1) This organization is named the Shanghai Municipal Literacy Education Promotion Association; (2) This association is affiliated with the City Party Headquarters as a cooperative organization for literacy education; (3) This association has five directors, appointed by the City Executive Committee to form the Board of Directors; (4) This association has one Managing Director to preside over all association affairs; (5) This association focuses on mobilizing party members and social organizations to hold literacy schools. After discussion, the principles were approved, and Tong Xingbai, Lu Jingshi, Lin Meiyan, Wang Yansong, and Li Suixian were appointed as directors of the Shanghai Municipal Literacy Education Promotion Association, and Tong Xingbai was designated as the Managing Director. The Board of Directors then appointed Chen Weiyi and seven others as staff members of the association, who held a meeting in the conference room of the City Party Headquarters yesterday (30th) at 3:00 PM,</p>
<p>First Discussion Meeting: Managing Director Tong Xingbai, staff members Chen Weiyi, Zhang Sheng, Mao Weixuan, Yu Zhenhui, Zhao Erchang, Peng Shuijie, Ying Shaoyan, and others attended. Tong Xingbai presided over the meeting and Gu Shaoyan took the minutes. After the usual formalities, the chairman first reported on the significance of the association's organization, the important mission it bears, the organizational guidelines, the methods for establishing schools, the work plan, and other revolutionary proposals, and then assigned the work of each division.</p>
<p>Assignment of Work for Each Division: (1) Party Affairs Division: Chen Weiyi; (2) Labor Movement Division: Zhang Sheng; (3) Commercial Movement Division: Zhao Erchang; (4) Agricultural Movement Division: Yu Zhenhui; (5) Social Organization Division: Mao Weixuan; (6) Women's Division: Peng Yongjie; (7) Document Division: Gu Shaoyan. The meeting adjourned at 5:00 PM.</p>
<h3>American Economic Survey Mission Continues Expert Meetings with Chinese Side Yesterday</h3>

In addition, the Proposal Group of the Reception Office convened a plenary committee meeting at the Banking Club at 7:00 PM last night to discuss and concentrate on the various opinions exchanged during the luncheon with the American Economic Survey Mission last week. It lasted a long time.</p>
<p>Member Continues to Arrive</p>
<p>American Economic Survey Mission member Kangpu Campbell and his wife arrived in Shanghai on the President McKinley of the Dollar Steamship Lines at 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon. The Reception Office and the Sino-American Trade Association sent personnel to welcome them at the dock. After disembarking, Mr. and Mrs. Kang went directly to the International Hotel to rest and meet with other members. Mr. Kang will remain here and join after the head of the mission, Forbes, returns to Shanghai from Guangzhou, and then go to Qingdao, Tianjin and other places to inspect. Kang Peibei was born in Pittsburg in 1882. He served in the American transportation industry for many years. From 1916 to 1918, he joined Wilcox Company as a secretary. Soon he was promoted to vice chairman of the company.</p>

<h3>Shi Zhaoji Discusses Meeting with Hull</h3>
<p>Details Cannot Be Disclosed</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports that after the United States continued to raise the price of silver, Shi Zhaoji, our ambassador to the United States, visited U.S. Secretary of State Hull again on the 25th of last month to reiterate the economic position of our country and ask for his attention. Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi replied to reporters' questions yesterday, saying that Ambassador Shi's meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hull had been reported to the Ministry by telegram. As for the details, because it concerns diplomacy, it is not yet convenient to disclose.</p>
<h3>Song Ziliang Changes Flight to Jiangxi This Morning, Signs Hydropower Plant Contract</h3>
<p>Song Ziliang, General Manager of the China Construction Bank, was originally scheduled to take a China National Aviation Corporation flight to Jiangxi yesterday morning to sign a contract with the Jiangxi provincial authorities for a hydropower plant in Jiangxi. However, due to an important meeting held by the China Construction Bank yesterday afternoon, it was rescheduled to this morning, still taking the plane. The preparation for the construction of the hydropower plant in Jiangxi has been underway for a long time. The capital is set at three million, of which one and a half million has been raised. The remaining amount is borrowed from the China Construction Bank. Mr. Song previously went to Jiangxi to meet with the provincial authorities and has already resolved the matter, so Mr. Song is personally going to sign the contract. It is also learned that Mr. Song has sent a German engineer, Aba, to Jiangxi in advance to plan everything.</p>
<h3>Zeng Yangfu Talks about Going to Guizhou Soon to Visit Chiang</h3>
<p>Negotiating Matters Concerning Road Construction in Guizhou Province; Visiting Kong Yesterday Morning to Discuss Loans is Incorrect</p>
<p>The New News Agency reports that Zeng Yangfu, Director of the Construction Department of Zhejiang Province and Director of the Highway Office of the Xingying, went to Nanjing from Hangzhou some time ago on official business. After the matter was completed, he came to Shanghai from Nanjing the night before and stayed at the New Asia Hotel. At 9:15 yesterday morning, he went to the Kong residence on Avenue Petain to visit Finance Minister Kong Xiangxi to discuss funding for the construction of the Hunan-Guizhou Highway and the Nanping section of the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway. He left at around 10:00. According to Mr. Zeng, he recently received a telegram from Chairman Chiang, and plans to stay in Shanghai for a day or two, then return to Hangzhou and go to Guiyang to pay respects to Chairman Chiang. Guizhou Province is currently making progress in suppressing bandits militarily, and road construction needs to be carried out urgently. In addition to seeking instructions, he also plans to stay for a longer period of time to plan everything. The Highway Office has already established an office in Yuanling, Hunan Province. When the reporter from the New News Agency asked whether it was true that Mr. Zeng was in Shanghai to negotiate with the banking community about borrowing money for the construction of the Nanping road and the 3 million borrowing for cocoon collection, as reported by Hangzhou Telegraph, Mr. Zeng immediately denied it. He said that he came to Shanghai to negotiate some trivial matters and did not have any contact with the banking community. It must be a misunderstanding.</p>
<h3>Overseas Chinese Expelled from Japan, Fifty-Second Batch Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday</h3>
<p>Wu Jueqi and Lin Ziying</p>
<p>The number of overseas Chinese expelled from Japan who have arrived in Shanghai has reached more than 500. It is learned that the 52nd batch of overseas Chinese, Wu Jueqi, Lin Ziying (from Wenzhou), and two Japanese wives, returned to the country on the President McKinley of the Dollar Steamship Lines and arrived in Shanghai at around 3:00 PM yesterday afternoon. They stayed at the Dajixiang Inn on Qianliupu, and the situation was quite embarrassing.</p>
<h3>Li Zeyi Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday, Japanese Diet Member Banxi Arrives on the Same Ship</h3>
<p>The New Sound News Agency reports that Li Zeyi, a member of the Political Consolidation Committee and advisor to the Fujian Provincial Government, and Japanese House of Peers member Lieutenant General Banxi, and one follower, arrived in Shanghai on the Sanbei Company's Wanwan at 6:30 PM yesterday. Japanese Diet member Banxi was received by the Japanese Consulate and Japanese friends in Shanghai and stayed at the Zhonghe Hotel. Li was taken back to his private residence on Yu Garden Road by his family. The New Sound News Agency reporter visited and received the following information:</p>
<p>Staying in Japan was a Private Matter</p>
<p>Mr. Li first said that he (Li referred to himself) took leave in late February for private matters in Japan, staying for a total of more than a month. While in Japan, in addition to handling private matters, he also visited old friends in the Japanese government and opposition parties. Foreign Minister Hirota had several meetings, purely for personal friendly visits. He also briefly discussed the national affairs of China and Japan. Because he went to Japan in a private capacity, not as a representative of the national government with any mission, he was very comfortable and had nothing to worry about.</p>
<p>Hope Japan has Sincerity</p>
<p>Regarding the improvement of diplomatic relations between China and Japan, in our opinion, our government has always treated all friendly countries with goodwill and sincerity, and friendly countries should also have sincerity towards us. The improvement will naturally not be a problem and can be seen soon.</p>
<p>Published a Long Article in Japan</p>
<p>Li also said that his trip was purely for private matters. While in Japan, reporters from Japanese newspapers also asked him to publish his opinions. He once published a long article based on his previous intentions. Because the luggage has just been unloaded, the boxes and chopsticks are a mess, and I cannot find it to show you (to the reporter). I have no opinion on the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, but based on my previous intentions, of course, there is nothing special.</p>
<p>Chiang's Envoy Will Not Return to the Country</p>
<p>I met with Ambassador Chiang from time to time in Japan. Mr. Chiang is in good health. The rumor that he will return to the country is absolutely untrue, because Ambassador Chiang has no need to return to the country at present, so he will not return to the country for the time being. As for the arrival of Japanese House of Peers member Lieutenant General Banxi in Shanghai, it was an accidental encounter on the ship when passing through Taiwan, not an appointment. Banxi came purely for sightseeing and had no mission. The ship stayed in Taiwan for eight days, and I was able to visit the officials in Taiwan and had a very happy conversation.</p>
<p>Stay in Fujian for a Week</p>
<p>After returning to the country and arriving in Fujian, I stayed for a week. Because I am an advisor to the Fujian Provincial Government, Chairman Chen often consulted me on matters in Fujian Province, and I always contributed what I knew about my hometown to Chairman Chen, in order to fulfill my humble responsibility as an advisor. Otherwise, wouldn't it be neglectful?</p>
<p>Visiting Mr. Huang is Undecided</p>
<p>Finally, he said that after returning to the country, he will stay in Shanghai for two or three days. Whether to visit Committee Chairman Huang in Moganshan, Hangzhou, is still uncertain. Returning to Beiping will also have to wait until the private matters in Shanghai are properly arranged before going north. In the next few days, I will visit relatives and friends in Shanghai whom I haven't seen for more than two months. There is nothing else to say.</p>
<h3>Art Exhibition, Pre-Exhibition Day 23</h3>
<p>Yesterday (30th) was the 23rd day of the Shanghai pre-exhibition of the London International Exhibition of Chinese Art. From 9:00 AM to 10:30 AM, more than 1,000 tickets had been sold, because the exhibition period is short and the opportunity is rare, everyone wants to feast their eyes.</p>
<p>Groups Visiting Yesterday</p>
<p>In recent days, the groups that have visited the exhibition include the Bank of China, Shanghai Guangong Second Elementary School, Jiading County Government, Tongji University, Jiangnan Business School, Songjiang Women's High School, Minguang High School, Guanghua University, Sanmin Elementary School, Engineering Research Institute of the Central Research Institute, Radio Broadcasting Station, Construction Committee of the National Government, Second Court of the Shanghai Special District, Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Children's School of the Central Aviation School, Suzhou Art College, Yangjing High School Guidance Office, Haiyun Art Society, Shanghai Youth High School, Shanghai Coal Industry Association, Elementary Schools of the Chinese Education Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Shanghai North High School, Shanghai Brick and Ash Industry Association, Friendship Association of the Chinese Cloth Exchange, China Art Society, Chongde Women's High School, Qingxin High School, Shanghai Chinese Medical Association, Tax Personnel Training Institute, Yuantai Co., Ltd., Zhijiang College of Arts and Sciences of Hangzhou, Private Sumin Elementary Vocational School, Shanghai Minqiang High School, China Anbu Enterprise Co., Ltd., China Public School, and many other places. In addition, Central Committee member Wang Qi and Professor Gao Jianfu of Sun Yat-sen University also visited the exhibition the day before yesterday. Wang and Gao are calligraphers and painters and have a clear understanding of the calligraphy and paintings on display.</p>
<p>Shi Chongpeng's Impressions</p>
<p>Shi Chongpeng, Executive Director of the Chinese Art Education Society, expressed the following impressions of this art exhibition: The products of this London Art Exhibition Shanghai pre-exhibition total more than 800 pieces. In terms of quantity, it is less rich than the collections of the late Qing Dynasty. I don't know if this small number only accounts for a few tenths of the total. In terms of quality, I don't know if the exhibits are enough to represent the masterpieces and artistic essence of the famous craftsmen and masters of our country in the past dynasties. However, in the past, the national system was autocratic, and the appreciation of art was almost exclusively owned by the emperors and the aristocratic class. The general public had no opportunity to appreciate it. The collections of the people are all fragments, secretly hidden and not declared. This is the first systematic and complete exhibition. Taking calligraphy and painting as an example, it can be divided into a vertical observation in history and a horizontal comparison of various schools and families. Although there are only five products from the Tang and Five Dynasties, the simplicity of the landscape painting style and the solemnity of the figures and palaces can be glimpsed. There are more than 50 works from the Song Dynasty, inheriting the Tang Dynasty, and the North and South schools compete against each other. The regions are different, and the painting styles are different. The majestic spirit of Dong Beiyuan's "Longsu Jiaomin Picture" and the light ink of Juran's "Hanlin Wanxiu" are enough to show the simplicity of the Southern School's landscape painting. Guo Heyang's colored waterscapes, with their craggy stone walls and majestic aura, Yan Cipin's "Four Music Picture" with its bold ink and fine brush strokes show the vigor of the North School's brushwork. The magnificence of Xia Gui's "Ten Thousand Miles of the Yangtze River" and the simplicity and beauty of "West Lake Willow Boats" give people a deep and beautiful feeling. Huizong used the heavy responsibility of the emperor to select the art garden. He was a king of the perished country in the country, and a master of the generation in art. The tranquility of "Pond Autumn Evening" and the delicate and elegant of the red reeds and white geese show the national spirit's love of peace. The landscapes of the four masters of the Yuan Dynasty were unrestrained in brush and ink, changing the restraint of the Song painting academy style and the solemnity of Jingguan Dongju. It can also be seen that in the late Yuan Dynasty, foreign bandits invaded China, and scholars came out to escape from the world and spend their time in writing. Yunlin's "Rong Tengzhai Picture" is secluded, and Mei Daoren's "Dongting Fisherman's Seclusion" is full of ink, which can be said to have escaped the form and is not in contact with human fireworks, which can be said to represent the literati paintings of the late Yuan Dynasty. Among the Ming paintings, Shen Shitian's "Lushan High" is tightly structured, with a vast brushstroke, and the true face of Lushan jumps on the paper. Dong Qichang's "Summer Wood Hanging Shade" is delicate and elegant, Tang Liuru's "Mountain Road Pine Sound" is vigorous and vivid, and Qiu Shifu's "Autumn River Waiting for Ferry" is meticulously crafted. They can all inherit from the predecessors and are worthy of the ancients. The landscapes of the four Wang Wu Yun of the Qing Dynasty seem to be more mediocre, not as prosperous as the Yuan and Ming Dynasties, but the exhibits here may not be their masterpieces. In short, this systematic display of famous works of the past dynasties for more than a thousand years allows the audience to explore and compare, which can be called a rare opportunity. The average daily number of visitors is more than 2,000, which also proves that the public's interest in art is extremely strong. It is hoped that the government will set up a hall to display the calligraphy, painting and antiques stored in the country after the closing ceremony in London, so that Chinese art will not only not be interrupted, but also can be promoted and carried forward.</p>

<h3>Headquarters of the Aviation Association's Fundraising Team Convenes Restaurant Representatives to Discuss Aviation Donation</h3>
<p>The headquarters of the Shanghai Fundraising Team of the China Aviation Association convened restaurant industry representatives from the entire city on the 3rd of last month. The first meeting discussed the collection of aviation donations for national salvation, as reported in previous newspapers. The headquarters held a second meeting at 5 PM yesterday at the 9th floor of the YMCA at Ba Xian Qiao. Attendees included Zhu Ligong from Da Quan Fu Restaurant, Li Mancun from Xing Hua Lou, Zheng Xingpu from Guan Sheng Yuan, Zhao Chunquan from Da Li Chun, Shen Xinsheng from Cai Xin Lou, Ni Hongquan from Xin Tai He Restaurant, Huang Zheng from Xiao You Tian Fujian Restaurant, Guo Yilin from Henan Liang Yuan Restaurant, Gu Chenglin from Tao Le Chun, Lin Jianshou from Ju Xing Guan, Chen Bin from Xie Yuan Guan, Qu Jintao from Tai He Guan, Ye Shengguan from Hong Yun Lou, Ye Qichang from Zhong Da Tian, Lu Ziting from Da San Yuan, Ren Xuexin from Xin Hong Lou, Liu Tingzhong from Dong Xing Lou, Yin Denghui from Xing Sheng Ju, Jiang Yunchuan from Da Ya Lou, Sun Futang from Yue Shi Lou, Ma Gengjiang from Ming Hu Chun, Yang Fuhong from Xin Yuan Xing, Liu Daofang from Jing Ji Sichuan Restaurant, Tang Xinyin from Qing Yi Se, Qian Qiusha from Hangzhou Restaurant, Lu Guanchu from Tao Tao Restaurant, Lu Junhuan from Jiangnan Chun, Zhou Linfu from Mei Yuan, and representatives from Mei Li Jin Ling Chun, totaling dozens of people. The headquarters was represented by Team Leader Mayor Wu (represented by Li Dachao), Li Dachao, Zhang Yuliang, Chen Shuo, Zhou Xin, Li Jimin, Zhu Shengyang, Bao Lengyun, Gu Shangrui, and Xue Baolun. Mayor Wu (represented by Li Dachao) presided over the meeting, with Chen Shuo as the recorder. The chairman reported, "Gentlemen, today, Mayor Wu, the team leader of the Shanghai Fundraising Team of the China Aviation Association, has convened you to discuss the collection of aviation donations for national salvation. The China Aviation Association has carefully considered that this city is the industrial and commercial economic center of the country. If all industries are willing to contribute to the aviation national salvation movement, the results will be remarkable. Industries that have already started collecting aviation donations for national salvation since last year include the hotel industry, fresh meat industry, and fresh pork selling industry, and the results are very good. Industries that will start collecting soon, such as the freight car industry, have approved the collection of 100,000 yuan, and the brick and tile transportation industries have approved the collection of 20,000 yuan. Industries that are in the process of deciding include the utilization of cigarette packs and waste materials. Gentlemen of the restaurant industry in the entire city are extremely enthusiastic about national salvation. We hope you will work hard to proceed. At our meeting on the 3rd of this month, we already convened a meeting. Today, we are convening another meeting to ask for your opinions. Collecting aviation donations for national salvation is just one more step in the catering business. Customers who eat and drink will not care about this small amount. I believe that if all restaurants are willing to help, the results will be very impressive in the future. Supporting the aviation national salvation movement is saving the country and saving ourselves." Zhang Yuliang then read the report from the previous meeting, and various representatives successively expressed their opinions on the method of collecting aviation donations for national salvation, to fulfill the people's obligation to save the country. Finally, the method of collection was discussed, and the meeting adjourned around 7 PM.</p>
<p>Team Leader Wang Xiaoying of Team 86 requested to add Mao Shengwu as the deputy team leader of the team. Team Leader Fei Fuheng of Team 283 requested to add Cheng Shaode and Wang Dehui as the deputy team leaders of the team. It is reported that the headquarters has already appointed them separately and issued appointment letters and various fundraising documents. Furthermore, Team Leader Xu Guanqun of Team 172 submitted membership fees of 84 yuan, and Team Leader He Zhuoxian of Team 218 submitted membership fees of 122 yuan, which have been received by the headquarters.</p>

<h3>Ministry of Communications Orders Airlines to Train Domestic Aviation Personnel to Develop Civil Aviation</h3>
<p>The China National Aviation Corporation and the Eurasia Aviation Corporation received an order from the Ministry of Communications yesterday: "The training of civil aviation technicians is the foundation for the development of the civil aviation industry.

Now, important national air routes urgently need to be opened, and domestic flight personnel are in particular need. All airlines should comply with the contract and the Ministry's repeated orders to actively train personnel so that domestic civilian pilots can take on the work in the shortest possible time. In addition to separate orders, the company is hereby ordered to comply with and earnestly implement the training matters, prepare a specific plan for review, and report the progress of the processing at any time. This is very important. This order."</p>

<h3>The Municipal Health Bureau Will Start Today a Citywide Epidemic Prevention Campaign with Anti-Epidemic Teams Departing for Work, Special Hospitals Offering Free Injections, Broadcasting Lectures on Prevention Knowledge, and Concession Authorities Assisting</h3>
<p>In order to prevent epidemics and protect the health of citizens, the Municipal Health Bureau has decided to start a citywide epidemic prevention campaign today. The bureau will organize large-scale anti-epidemic injection teams to depart for service. At the same time, special large and small hospitals will offer free anti-epidemic injections to citizens, and broadcasting lectures will be held. The Concession authorities will assist. The following is a report from the Dagong News reporter:</p>
<p>Anti-Epidemic Teams Depart for Service</p>
<p>In view of the spread of various epidemics in the summer, the Municipal Health Bureau believes that if prevention can be done in advance, it can be avoided. Therefore, on the day of the start of the citywide epidemic prevention campaign, an anti-epidemic injection team was organized to depart to various alleys and roads in the urban area and various schools to provide free anti-epidemic injections to citizens to protect their health. Four teams have been formed, each with a doctor leading several nurses, to serve the urban area. After the completion, they will continue to work in the rural areas. Two more teams will be added in half a month and sent to various factory areas to provide free injections to the working class.</p>
<p>Special Hospitals Offering Free Injections</p>
<p>For the sake of universal epidemic prevention, in addition to the municipal hospitals in the north and south, the bureau has also specially appointed large and small hospitals and clinics in the city to provide free injections to citizens from today onwards. Citizens who want to get anti-epidemic injections can go directly to the following hospitals for injections: (1) Shanghai Epidemic Hospital, (2) Shanghai Emergency Epidemic Hospital, (3) Shanghai Hospital in Nanshi, (4) Zhongde Hospital, (5) Tongde Hospital, (6) Women and Children's Hospital, (7) Labor Hospital, (8) Taizhou Hospital, (9) Nanyang Hospital, (10) Red Cross General Hospital, (11) Red Cross Second Hospital, (12) Red Cross Third Hospital, (13) Xin Puyu Hall Clinic, (14) Huxi Gongshe Clinic, (15) Lianyi She Western Hospital, (16) Pushan Hall Clinic, (17) Public Education Hall Clinic, (18) Pudong Children's Clinic.</p>
<p>Broadcasting Lectures and Universal Publicity</p>
<p>Mr. Li Tingan, Director of the Municipal Health Bureau, believes that the spread of epidemics is due to the lack of epidemic prevention knowledge among citizens. In order to publicize epidemic prevention, he has specially invited health experts and famous doctors to broadcast lectures on epidemic prevention methods and common sense on epidemic prevention from today onwards, through the Sino-Western Radio Station and the Buddhist Sound Radio Station, so that ordinary people can understand and promote the attention of the general public and prevent it as soon as possible to protect their health. The order, program, and time are all being scheduled and will be announced in the newspapers soon. At the same time, people will be sent to give lectures to instill essential epidemic prevention knowledge to citizens.</p>
<p>Implementing Citywide Slum Injections</p>
<p>The bureau believes that the poor people in the urban area live in unhygienic living environments every day, and their residences are often the source of epidemics. In order to get to the root of the problem and protect the health of the poor, a large number of staff members were assigned to groups, equipped with the necessary medicines and equipment, and sent to the slum areas of Zhabei, Nanshi, etc., to implement forced anti-epidemic injections.</p>
<p>Concession Authorities Assist</p>
<p>The health authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession believe that the number of residents in the district is large and the summer when epidemics are rampant is approaching. In order to prevent problems before they occur, they have also decided to order doctors to drive ambulances to various roads in the district to provide anti-epidemic injections to citizens from today onwards to assist.</p>
<h3>International Trade Bureau Introduces Domestic Products</h3>
<p>According to the International Trade Bureau yesterday, the bureau recently received many letters from European and American countries requesting domestic products. The following are now published, and each export manufacturer can write to the bureau's guidance department for introduction: (1) The Physical Fitness Progress Import and Export Company of Chicago, USA, is willing to trade with manufacturers of cotton fabrics, socks, carpets, tea, furs, etc. Please use US dollars to specify the C.I.F. Chicago delivery price, and explain the delivery and payment terms. It is best to attach a sample. (2) The Belgian Alang Xu Shi Company and the French Feininuo Company both need livestock. (3) The Spanish Jia Zha Ma Company is willing to trade with commercial firms that operate the following commodities: plant weaving products, rayon weaving products, Hankou livestock, Hankou tung oil, bamboo poles, etc. The bureau's address is at No. 1040 North Suzhou Road, Bank of China Building.</p>
<h3>The New Yuan History Lawsuit Judgment: Tan Da Has Paid the Fine</h3>
<p>Tan Tian, the general manager of the Book and Newspaper Cooperative, made a pre-sale reservation for the Twenty-Six Histories compiled by the company. Zhang Xichen, the manager of the Kaiming Bookstore, claimed that the New Yuan History in the Twenty-Six Histories was copied from the New Yuan History in the Twenty-Five Histories published by the bookstore. Therefore, due to the copyright dispute, they attacked each other in newspapers. Later, Zhang Xichen hired a lawyer to sue Tan Da in the First Special District Local Court for infringing copyright and damaging reputation. As a result of the first instance, the part of the infringement of copyright was rejected, and the rest of the part was judged that Tan Tian had committed the two crimes of public insult and defamation, and was fined 200 yuan. However, Tan denied that the word "mercenary" in the advertisement was a derogatory term, and it was not specifically referring to the Kaiming Bookstore. The phrase "missing and wrong" was not a groundless accusation. Therefore, he was not satisfied with the original judgment and hired a lawyer to file an appeal. The trial has now been concluded. For the defamation part of the original judgment, Tan Tian was declared not guilty, and only a fine of 100 yuan was imposed for the crime of public insult. The second-instance judgment of the case has been sent by the court to both the plaintiff and the defendant. The reasons for the judgment are quite fair and sufficient. It is roughly stated that the plaintiff published an advertisement for the New Yuan History of the Twenty-Five Histories on December 27th last year, publishing the book early. The appellant clearly stated in the advertisement that the book was published early, and there is no doubt that it was referring to the plaintiff. According to the ordinary concept of society, the word "mercenary" is a derogatory term for scolding bad businessmen. The appellant said that the word "mercenary" is not an insult, and it is inevitable to quibble. The original trial determined that the crime of public insult was not inappropriate. However, the plaintiff has published the "Zheng" character of the first year of the Wei Zhengshi in the 14th row of the 6th page of the Book of Jin in the Twenty-Five Histories, which was mistaken as the character "Zhi." In the 27th row of the 4th row of the Book of Jin, the character "Guan" of the Chinese and foreign astrology was mistaken as the official character. In the 20th row of the 4th row of the Book of Jin Biography, the character "Shi" of the border soldiers was mistaken as the upper character. In the Book of Jin Zhi, the character "Xiao" which was mistakenly made as a small note on the 36th row of the 44th page was missing as small. In the 5th row of the 3rd row of the 103rd page of the Book of Jin Biography, the character "Wei" of the requisition letter "Wei" was missing as a husband. The original book was submitted by the appellant as evidence. The appellant's accusation that the Twenty-Five Histories published by the plaintiff were missing and wrong has been proved to be true and is related to the public interest. According to the provisions of Article 326 of the Criminal Law, it is not in the list of words. The original trial's judgment that the appellant groundlessly accused the appellant and punished him for the crime of defamation under Article 325, Paragraph 2 of the Criminal Law is still difficult to say. There is no reason to attack the intent of the appeal here. The original judgment recognized that the appellant had committed the two crimes of public insult and defamation, and should be revoked and changed in accordance with Article 70 of the Criminal Law. Tan believed that the judgment of the second instance was fair and should be convinced. Yesterday, at the time of the execution, he specially sent the fine of 100 yuan to the court and paid it off to the execution court.</p>
<h3>Second Session of Group Wedding Held Today; Rehearsal Held Yesterday</h3>
<p>The second group wedding in this city will be held at 3:00 PM today in the City Hall auditorium. The city government has reformed the order inside and outside the auditorium and the economical use of time during the ceremony. Furthermore, to ensure that the wedding participants move in an orderly manner and that the etiquette is thoughtful, a wedding rehearsal will be held one day prior, following the practice of the previous session. A reporter from the Central News Agency has filed the following details:</p>
<p>Auditorium Decoration</p>
<p>The interior and exterior decorations of the City Hall auditorium have been completely renewed today. The altar tables and chairs are surrounded by red embroidered cushions, and each wall to the left is decorated with double happiness red banners. A red carpet extends from the altar to the front door to welcome the wedding participants. Red cloth has also been used to create a barrier, preventing spectators in the guest seating area from entering. On the square in front of the City Hall gate, a semi-circular red cloth barrier has been set up to facilitate the entry and exit of the wedding participants and for photography, preventing the crowd from rushing in and disrupting order. The design is quite thoughtful.</p>
<p>Slight Changes in Etiquette</p>
<p>The wedding procession and etiquette for this group wedding have been slightly modified compared to the previous session. In addition to the bride and groom being led by Zhang Binghui and his wife, the fourth section chief of the Social Affairs Bureau, nine male and nine female students from the Municipal Wanzhu Elementary School will participate in the procession. The first couple will each carry a covered box, containing the wedding participants' request and the mayor's address, etc. The other eight couples will each carry lanterns with double happiness characters, palace lanterns, bright horn lanterns, and incense burners, which looks quite solemn. Mayor Wu has also taken steps to save time, so that after the bride and groom face each other in front of the altar for the wedding ceremony, they will then take turns going to the altar to receive their certificates, etc., which is much more time-saving than having each couple go to the altar for the ceremony as in the previous session.</p>
<p>Wedding Ceremony</p>
<p>The second group wedding ceremony is as follows: (1) Stand at attention; (2) Give the highest salute to the Party, National Flag, and the portrait of Dr. Sun Yat-sen; (3) Bride and groom face each other to perform the wedding ceremony (bow twice); (4) Return to position; (5) Receive certificates; (6) Salute the officiant (bow once); (7) Take positions; (8) The officiant reads the certificate; (9) Mayor's address; (10) All wedding participants offer thanks to the officiant (bow once). Photography after the ceremony.</p>
<p>Rehearsal Held Yesterday</p>
<p>Yesterday at 3:00 PM, all thirty-five couples participating in the second group wedding arrived at the City Hall on time to participate in the wedding rehearsal. Men and women were dressed in formal attire (the eighteenth couple temporarily withdrew because the bride's formal attire had not yet been made). At 3:00 PM, the Municipal Police Band played music, and the bride and groom, led by Zhang Binghui and his wife, as well as nine male and nine female students from Wanzhu Elementary School, entered the auditorium in two rows. The rehearsal, led by master of ceremonies Wang Xianqing under the guidance of Mayor Wu, lasted for two hours. Although this event was a rehearsal, there were still over a thousand spectators. The number of spectators today will surely be several times greater, which shows the general public's great interest in group weddings.</p>
<p>Mayor's Guidance</p>
<p>After guiding the wedding procession to completion, Mayor Wu gave a brief speech to the wedding participants. He first explained the large amount of consumption on weddings and funerals in our country, and the unreasonable situation in which the general public even borrows money to hold them. He then said that a non-solemn wedding cannot be called a ceremony, and that economy of money and time is especially important. He hoped that Shanghai would take the lead in promoting group weddings so that they could be popularized. Finally, he gave the brides three pieces of advice: (1) Do not let your hair down on the wedding day; (2) Wear formal shoes (do not wear casual shoes), preferably those made of domestic black satin; (3) Do not walk too fast.</p>
<p>List of Newcomers</p>

<h3>Ten Lawsuits Filed Against Wing On Bank, With Five New Cases Recently; Most Defendants Fail to Appear</h3>
<p>Wing On Bank has been stranded again since its reopening, and this has been going on for several months. Initially, it attempted to revive itself, but recently, due to the shareholders' decision not to increase capital, it declared bankruptcy. The entire board of directors, general manager, managers, and other responsible parties have been sued by creditors such as Wang Weiguan for fraud and embezzlement in criminal self-suits filed with the First Special District Local Court. However, only the general manager, Ou Jiancheng, and assistant manager, Luo Huafang, have turned themselves in. Ou was released on bail of 30,000 yuan, and Luo on bail of 5,000 yuan. Recently, creditors of the company have continued to file lawsuits with the court, accusing the directors, general manager, and managers of embezzlement and fraud. Five new cases have been added, bringing the total number of cases to over ten, including those previously filed. Yesterday afternoon, Judge Wu Zehan continued the joint trial. Some plaintiffs appeared in court in person, while others were represented by lawyers. Only Luo Huafang appeared as a defendant. The rest, including Li Du, Wang Jiazhen, Mo Dehui, Lin Kanghou, Zhang Zilian, Deng Jingbao, Ye Hancheng, Qian Youju, Peng Baohui, Lin Qiuhu, Gu Chuntao, Jiang Qi, Ou Jiancheng, Dai Kechang, Shen Zufu, and Wang Yongxin, all failed to appear. According to lawyer Li Shirui, Ou Jiancheng could not appear because his father was seriously ill and he was attending to him. As for the company's account books, lawyer Shen Qichang, who was responsible for their safekeeping, went to Hangzhou to bury his father, so only three volumes of meeting minutes were submitted. The rest would have to wait for lawyer Shen to return to Shanghai. Regarding the possibility of reconciliation, it is still ongoing, and some have already reached an agreement, so he requested another postponement to allow for continued processing. Lawyer Chen Tingrui, representing Luo Huafang, stated that Luo had little involvement but turned himself in after being implicated, only to be released on bail. However, the defendants who bear major responsibility remain at large. If this is prolonged, Luo cannot endure the pain, and he requested that Luo's part of the charges be tried first. The lawyer for Lin Kanghou still claimed that Lin could not appear because he was attending a meeting. The plaintiffs were amused that Lin's lawyer always claimed Lin's absence was due to attending meetings and expressed their displeasure. Subsequently, the court questioned the plaintiffs in the five newly filed cases one by one. Li Liangbin and Zhang Jinshui requested that the charges against Dai Kechang be withdrawn, which Judge Wu approved. The lawyers for Yu Hanji and Yu Shuji stated that the money owed to the two Yujis was all guarantee money paid for trading in public bonds, with Hanji owing over 300 yuan and Shuji owing over 900 yuan, and submitted account books as evidence. The lawyers for Li Qing, Han Runqing, Liu Zufa, and Tang Hanpeizhi stated that the money owed to Li and the others was also guarantee money for trading in American cotton and rubber, totaling over 6,500 yuan. However, lawyer Li Shirui said that this guarantee should be settled after the goods arrive and the profits and losses are calculated. Filing a lawsuit at this time is inappropriate. Finally, the plaintiff Chen Bing stated that the case he filed had been settled by Shen Zufu, and he requested permission to withdraw the lawsuit, which Wu also approved. He then ordered that the case be adjourned to 2 PM on May 14 for further hearing.</p>
<h3>Major Kidnapping for Ransom Suspect, Dong Zhangfa, Escorted to Ningbo</h3>
<p>Dong Zhangfa, a 41-year-old Ningbo native, colluded with Zhang Jinbiao (also known as Mao Laogou) and Jin Chang in Yin County last September 6, who has already been apprehended and shot, to commit numerous kidnappings for ransom. He fled to Shanghai to evade arrest by the local Public Security Bureau, hiding his whereabouts secretly and without a fixed residence. At 1:40 PM on the 19th of last month, informant Xiang Chunsheng, accompanied by detective Mao Songshou and Chinese constable Chen Dabao, number 2121, apprehended the suspect Dong on Wusong Road, brought him to the Hongkou police station, and escorted him to the First Special District Court for detention. Yesterday morning, Judge Jiang Shuzi of the Criminal Court continued the trial. Detective Mao submitted an official letter requesting that the defendant be transferred. The Shanghai Municipal Council lawyer Li Zhishan agreed. When questioned, Dong's confession was evasive and he denied the charges. Judge Jiang ordered Dong Zhangfa to be transferred to the Ningbo Public Security Bureau.</p>
<h3>Child Goodwill Visit Telegram, Central Radio Station Receives and Relays, May 18 World Goodwill Day</h3>
<p>The Chinese Red Cross Society, with the American Red Cross, will celebrate World Goodwill Day on May 18. Children from that organization will broadcast 71 goodwill messages to countries around the world via a private shortwave radio station. These telegrams are intended to be received and forwarded to schools for children. The Red Cross Society sent a letter last month requesting permission from our government through the Red Cross, and it was submitted to the Ministry of Interior for review by the Ministry of Transportation and Communications and the Ministry of Education. It is now known that the Ministry of Education has sent a letter to the Central Radio Station Management Office, requesting it to receive and relay the messages at that time, and to instruct schools in Nanjing to join in the children's broadcasting program and send congratulatory messages. The Central Radio Station believes that this matter concerns friendly relations between countries and should be handled accordingly. However, the distance between the two sides is quite far, and it is the height of summer, so reception and relaying may be difficult. Furthermore, the call sign, wavelength, power, and broadcasting time of the station were not specified in the original letter, making it impossible to test. It is feared that it will be difficult to achieve satisfactory results. In addition to the children's broadcasting program, which has been scheduled from 8:50 PM to 9:25 PM on May 18 at the Nanjing Central Radio Station, it is reported that the Ministry of Education has replied to the Chinese Red Cross Society yesterday.</p>
<h3>Shanghai Telephone Bureau, Traffic Information Desk Starts Service Today, Dial 29 for Inquiries, No Call Charges Except for Long Distance and Public Telephones</h3>

If the inquiry cannot be answered directly at once, the information desk will provide the inquirer with the telephone number of the agency, company, or venue that handles the matter for direct inquiry.

<h3>Du Takes Over as Acting General Manager of Shishi News and Three Other Companies, Zhang Zhuping Hospitalized for Rest</h3>
<p>Mr. Zhang Zhuping, director and general manager of the Shishi News, Dalu News, Da Wanbao, and Shenshi Telegraph Agency, has served in the news industry for over twenty years. Since resigning from his position as manager of Shen Bao, he has devoted himself to the affairs of the four companies, sparing no effort, which has led to accumulated fatigue and illness for months. Chinese and Western doctors have repeatedly advised him to reduce his workload and choose a place to rest and recuperate. Recently, Mr. Zhang stated to the board of directors of the four companies that the work of the four companies has gradually gotten on track, and after moving into the new location, they can better communicate with each other. In the future, they only need to proceed step by step to develop. He can temporarily put a stop to business operations and has requested to resign from his position to allow for long-term rest and treatment of his chronic illness. Until Mr. Zhang's position is formally re-elected, Mr. Du Yuesheng, a director, will temporarily be responsible for handling the affairs. It is known that Mr. Zhang has now moved into the hospital and, following doctors' orders, is declining to see guests for quiet recuperation. Mr. Du officially arrived at the company yesterday to take over his duties. He met with the heads of the four companies, toured the departments, and offered considerable comfort to the staff.</p>

<h3>Grand Occasion of the National Goods Relief Fair Yesterday</h3>
<p>The Shanghai National Goods Movement Relief Fair at the Xiaoximen Penglai City Market has been crowded with male and female guests since its opening for several days. It is learned that the fair has specifically sent letters to the local entertainment industry and various radio stations to provide voluntary broadcasting, and has hired a band of more than ten people to parade through the busy streets every day, distributing leaflets to raise awareness among the citizens.

<h3>Special Ship for Beidaihe Summer Resort</h3>
<p>Beidaihe is a famous summer resort in North China. Every summer, thousands of Chinese and Westerners go there for summer vacation. However, the place is far away, and few southerners go there due to the hardship of the journey. Previously, the cargo ships of the Kailuan Mining Company operated between Shanghai and Qinhuangdao, but the schedule was irregular, which was inconvenient for travelers. It is heard that this summer, the company has seven special ships operating between the two places, and they have added exquisite cabins that are extremely comfortable. The fares are also quite low, with first class costing only 80 yuan and third class costing 10 yuan. To facilitate inquiries and ticket purchases for passengers, they have specifically entrusted the China Travel Service at No. 420 Sichuan Road in this city to be the exclusive ticket agent. Recently, those who have been going to the agency to book tickets have been quite crowded.</p>

<h3>City Center Area: Construction Actively Underway</h3>
<p>Various construction projects in the city center area are currently being actively pursued, and most of them are expected to be completed within this year. Furthermore, the National Games will be held in Shanghai on the Double Tenth Festival (October 10th), so the construction of the Municipal Stadium and the railway in the city center is being expedited. The following is based on a statement by Mr. Xue Ci-shen, Section Chief of the Third Section of the Municipal Bureau of Public Works:</p>
<p>Municipal Stadium: The Municipal Stadium in the city center area will be completed by August of this year. The sports meets of high schools and other schools in the city in the next semester can then be held there. Moreover, as the National Games will be held in the city on the Double Tenth Festival, a grand occasion is anticipated. Therefore, a railway is being built from the Gaojing Temple Station on the Songhu Branch Road along Sanmin Road to the city center area. Construction has been underway for several days and is expected to be completed before the Double Tenth Festival. In the future, trains will run, each carrying 2,000 passengers. As for the roads, the original width of the road from Fudan University to the Municipal Stadium was only two zhang (approximately 6.6 meters), but it is now being widened to three zhang (approximately 10 meters). This is also expected to be fully completed before the Double Tenth Festival, at which time traffic should be much more convenient, and there should be no more concerns about congestion.</p>
<p>Qiujiang Wharf: Regarding the Qiujiang Wharf, it has already been established by the Central Bank. The local government is assisting the Central Bank in purchasing the land in the vicinity. The construction of the wharf will be comprehensive, and all planning will be done by the Central Bank. In the future, the completion of this wharf will be of great help to Shanghai's industry and commerce, and the wharf's business will also be very prosperous. In order to facilitate convenient land and water transportation, the municipal government is also building a railway from the Qiujiang Wharf to connect with Songhu Road. In the future, the transportation of both export and import goods will be extremely convenient.</p>
<p>Su-Hu Highway: Mr. Xue also informed us of the recent progress of the Su-Hu Highway (Suzhou-Shanghai Highway). According to him, the Hu-Kun section of the Su-Hu Highway is being supervised by the Bureau. The road surface is cinder, and the cost is about 300,000 yuan. Currently, the road surface and bridge projects from Shanghai to Lujiabang have been largely completed and are expected to be completed in about two months. As for the road construction from Kunshan to Suzhou, the Construction Department of Jiangsu Province is responsible for it. The cost is higher than the Hu-Kun section undertaken by the city, at about 400,000 to 500,000 yuan, because there are more bridges in the Su-Kun section and the river surface is wider. This project is also expected to be completed in early July. As for when it can be opened to traffic, it is still up to the decision of higher authorities.</p>
<h3>Fire on a Hua Neng Head Iron Barge</h3>
<p>At 1:00 PM yesterday, a No. 3 iron barge moored at the Swire Company's Huatong No. 4 Wharf on Peidong Lan Ni Du caught fire. The barge contained 180 pieces of hemp rope, waiting to be unloaded from a Hubei steamer. At that time, it is unknown how, a fire suddenly broke out in the barge's hold, and the fire inside became increasingly fierce, with thick smoke billowing from the hatch. The crew discovered this and urgently reported it to the office, which informed the Customs Water Police Station, which immediately dispatched a fireboat to put out the fire. It took about an hour to extinguish the fire completely. It is estimated that dozens of pieces of hemp rope were destroyed.</p>
<h3>Change of Head of the Criminal Division of the District Court</h3>

<h3>Unsuccessful Mediation for Rent Reduction in Baoxing Lane</h3>
<p>The owners of Baoxing Lane on Baoshan Road in Zhabei are Tongfu Company, organized by Ni Jin-gui, Ding Lian-sun, Zhang Meng-geng, and others. They mortgaged the nearby land to the Four Banks Joint Savings Society for 300,000 yuan to build houses. Because they had to repay interest, the rents were more expensive than those of ordinary houses, ranging from 18 to 38 yuan per house. This was inconsistent with the municipal rental regulations. They collected two months' rent as a deposit and also required a guarantor, calculating the value, the rent was equivalent to an interest rate of 1.8% per month. The tenants could not afford it, so they petitioned the Shanghai District Court for mediation to pay 70% of the rent. Yesterday afternoon, the mediation court was held. The tenants were represented by lawyers Hu Yu-kang and Yu Hua-long. The court also believed that the petition was well-founded and advised the defendant, Tongfu Company, to offer some discount. The company said that it could not reduce the rent due to the loan. The tenants had to file a formal lawsuit and immediately left the court.</p>

<h3>Continued Hearing of the Coconut Oil Tax Evasion Case</h3>
<p>In the spring of the 21st year of the Republic of China (1932), the Yong'anxiang National Goods Store at No. 2, Tongde Lane, Zilai Street, French Concession, entrusted the Xincheng Customs Brokerage at No. 12, Yide Lane on the same street, to declare and pay taxes to the Jianghai Customs and extract 200 barrels of imported coconut oil. Now, the Customs has received a tip-off that Yong'anxiang evaded taxes on the coconut oil it declared. The Customs investigated and found it to be true and reported it to the French Police Station, which sent detectives to bring Jiang Qing-biao, the manager of Yong'anxiang, to the Second Special District Court to file a public prosecution. After the hearing, he was ordered to post bail while the matter was being verified. This was briefly reported earlier. Yesterday, Judge Wang Gang-xi of the Second Special Court opened a court to summon him. Wu Han, the director of the General Affairs Section of the Jianghai Customs, and Secretary Ying Xin-ji, came to court and stated that the defendant, Yong'anxiang, had previously entrusted Fengchang Customs Brokerage to declare 200 pieces of coconut oil to the Customs, weighing 69 dan and 85 jin, and should have paid 2,061.8 gold yuan in taxes, totaling 1,892.25 yuan in tax evasion. It was found that the tax evasion was due to collusion between the owner and lower-level Customs personnel and listeners. The same case had occurred three years ago, with a very large amount involved. After it was discovered, the Customs filed a lawsuit with the local government. The Customs is represented by lawyer Jiang Yi-ping in this case and also entrusted him to handle it. They should ask lawyer Jiang for details. Lawyer Jiang Yi-ping then said that he, as the lawyer representing the Customs, requested that the evaded taxes be recovered. However, the Customs also had a collusion and fraud incident three years ago and filed a lawsuit with the local government, involving more than a dozen people. As a result, they were sentenced to five years, three years, several months, and other terms of imprisonment. Since the defendant in this case did not have any collusive behavior, the payment ledger should be submitted to the court to verify whether it matches the declared amount. If there is no discrepancy, there should be no suspicion of a crime. Furthermore, since the defendant did not have any collusive behavior, why was the owner of Xincheng Customs Brokerage not brought to court? The defendant's defending lawyers, Wu Lin-kun and Zhao Han-yun, rose to argue that the defendant had paid all the customs duties due to Xincheng Customs Brokerage in full at the beginning, and there are ledgers to prove this, without any errors. They requested that the ledgers be submitted to the court for verification. As for Hu Rui-zhuang, the owner of Xincheng Customs Brokerage, he was previously brought to the police station by Shen Wei-qing, an employee of Yong'anxiang, but was released immediately after being questioned by a Western detective. The police station did not prosecute the main person involved but instead prosecuted the defendant. They did not know the reason and asked the court to pay attention to it. The judge then questioned Ying Xin-ji, the representative of the plaintiff, and asked if he had investigated the collusive and fraudulent officials in this case. He replied that it was difficult to investigate due to the lapse of many years. Perhaps it was the people currently detained by the local government who colluded, which was also unknown. Judge Wang verified the statements and ordered that the hearing be adjourned to 9:00 AM on May 14th for further investigation.</p>

Li Zhi-shan, a lawyer from the Municipal Council, stated the previous circumstances and filed a public prosecution in accordance with Article 6 of the Anti-Smoking Law. Wang Hua, the detective, then reported the process of solving the case and presented the drug pills for inspection. When questioned, the defendant's statement was vague. Judge Jiang Shu-zi sentenced Yang Xiu-chun to six months in prison, and the drug pills were confiscated and burned.</p>

<h3>The Lawsuit Over the Poop King's Inheritance is Not Over, and Another Monthly Accusation Case Continues</h3>

It was divided into ten shares, with each share costing 7,000 yuan. Golden Record got one share, Wang Ting-xiu Tang got one share, Fang Yu-chu Tang got one share, the defendant's mother and sons got six and a half shares, and the plaintiff got half a share. A contract was signed, with each party holding a copy. The mother and sons then (Ma Gui-ji and Ma Hong-kui have passed away) were in charge of the matter. There have been surpluses over the years, totaling more than 1.4 million yuan (i.e., the newspaper reported that the defendant and Hong-kui's wife were fighting over 4 million yuan in property, which is sufficient to prove this). The contract clearly states that a monthly statement must be submitted to the shareholders at the end of each month, and a shareholders' meeting must be held every six months. Now that Hong-kui has died, the defendants are even involved in public lawsuits due to the uneven distribution of embezzled money. The defendants' family is not rich. How can they suddenly become wealthy and become wealthy? All of this is sufficient to prove that they embezzled others' surpluses and took them for themselves. Moreover, after the contract expired (specified with the Public Works Bureau for five years), the defendants not only embezzled the surplus and did not distribute it according to the contract, but also privately continued to use the Golden Record brand to continue to fulfill the contract with the French Public Works Bureau. It can be said that the defendants' current business still belongs to the plaintiff as a shareholder. Tian's contract does not specify the time limit for the partnership and has not been announced to be dissolved. All of this is sufficient to prove that the defendants are selfish and cannot be defended. In the early stage of the operation, the plaintiff was still in contact with the defendants, but there has been no mention of anything since then. Shareholders' meetings have never been held, and it is rumored that they have secretly changed the account books in order to cover up the facts. The heart is laborious to falsify. Once confronted, witnesses will naturally discover the facts, which can prove it. Judging from their behavior, the defendants have committed crimes under Articles 357 and 366 of the Criminal Law. They specifically state this in the lawsuit and request the court to detain the defendants to the case and issue an arrest warrant, and order them to hand over various genuine old books and records related to the cleaning contracts over the years for verification, so as to prevent fraud. If they are filled with fake books, the plaintiff will file another suit to request additional charges to warn against deception and punish the illegal. Regarding the attached civil suit, the defendants are requested to be sentenced at the same time to (1) jointly recover the capital of 3,500 yuan, (2) official profits over the years, and (3) surpluses over the years totaling 50,000 yuan. According to the lawsuit, Judge Li Chang-nian of the court specifically opened the Second Criminal Division yesterday to summon the parties, who arrived with their lawyers. First, the plaintiff Feng Zhi-ming stated the meaning of the lawsuit and submitted a photograph of the contract and a copy of the payment voucher for the capital that year. When asked, Ma Hong-gen stated that this matter was handled by our late mother. After our brothers and others arrived at the scene to sign and seal the contract, the late mother took back the contract because the shareholders had not paid all the money, cleared it, and it had been dissolved. Before the late mother passed away, she told us that it was handled by the late mother before, and it was handled by the eldest brother Hong-kui after the mother passed away. We did not know. At this point, after the lawyers of both parties expressed their opinions, the official ruled that they could not rely on one-sided words and adjourned the hearing to May 9 for further questioning, and ordered both parties to submit the evidence related to the case in writing before the next hearing for verification. After the discussion, the court declared that the court was adjourned.</p>
<h3>Broadcasting Station</h3>
<p>Eagle King Brand Fresh Orange Juice Company Hires Famous Broadcasters. The Eagle King Brand Fresh Orange Juice, issued by the Hong Kong Fresh Orange Juice Company at 594 Nanjing Road, is highly welcomed by all sectors due to its superior fragrance. More than 14,000 bottles have reportedly been sold in less than a month since its release. Major companies and well-known theaters are all selling products of this company. Recently, several companies, including the Shanghai Race Club, Yiyuan Dog Racing Track, Xin Ya Restaurant, and Da San Yuan Restaurant, have signed exclusive sales contracts. Yesterday, when meeting Director Hong of the company's Western District distribution center, it was learned that the raw materials used by the company are extremely conscientious. Taking white sugar as an example, not only is saccharin not used, but a kind of crystal sugar that is several times more expensive than ordinary white sugar is used. After the fresh orange juice is made, there is absolutely no turbidity, and it is sweet but not greasy, just right. Because the price is too high, only one American bread and candy company on Nanjing Road used this kind of sugar in Shanghai before. Furthermore, in order to thank the patrons, the company has invited comedian Liu Chunshan and Shenqu opera master Xiao Wenbin to broadcast various exciting programs starting today.</p>

<h3>Traffic Bank Business Report (5)</h3>
<p>3. Business Conditions of the Bank in the 23rd Year</p>
<p>The domestic and international economic conditions of the 23rd year have been briefly described above. In order to adapt to the environment and strive for progress, the Bank has made efforts to expand inland agencies to bring the inland areas and cities closer, so as to adjust funds for rural areas. On the one hand, it has widely established warehouses to promote credit against goods, and on the other hand, it has focused on investment in production undertakings, so that the circulation of goods can be smooth and unimpeded. In order to improve service efficiency, it has promoted cooperation with counterparts externally to avoid unnecessary competition, and has carried out unified management internally to concentrate talents and strength. All plans have been implemented in order. The general situation of the Bank's business and work in the past year is described in detail below.</p>
<p>A. Business Overview</p>
<p>(1) Deposits. The total balance of the Bank's deposits in the 23rd year was more than 242.047 million yuan, an increase of more than 29.055 million yuan compared with the 22nd year, and an increase of more than 58.1988 million yuan compared with the 21st year. The balance of fixed deposits was more than 65.2999 million yuan, an increase of more than 12.164 million yuan compared with the 22nd year, and an increase of more than 20.562 million yuan compared with the 21st year. The balance of current deposits was more than 171.285 million yuan, an increase of more than 12.681 million yuan compared with the 22nd year, and an increase of more than 33.8008 million yuan compared with the 21st year. The balance of cashier's checks and miscellaneous deposits was more than 5.463 million yuan, an increase of more than 4.2009 million yuan compared with the 22nd year, and an increase of more than 3.827 million yuan compared with the 21st year. If we compare the balance of each item of deposits in this year with the total balance, the current deposits are the most, accounting for 70.76%, followed by fixed deposits, accounting for 26.98%, and cashier's checks and miscellaneous deposits are the least, accounting for only 2.26%. Except for the item of cashier's checks, which does not accrue interest and is rarely needed in the inland areas, so the amount of deposits has always been the least. Furthermore, in terms of the increase and decrease of fixed and current deposits, although the increase in current deposits has been greater than that of fixed deposits over the years, the proportion of the increase has gradually approached the speed of fixed deposits. This trend is more obvious in this year. The reasons are roughly as follows: The Bank treats all types of deposits equally, but the original amount of deposits is more current than fixed, so although the increase is similar, the trend is obviously different. First, the market atmosphere has been sluggish in recent years, and there is an excess of floating capital. Those with some assets are happy to deposit in banks to ensure safety and consider both principal and interest. Second, the Bank's branches in various places have increased significantly during the year. Although not all of them are deposit terminals, there is also a part of household deposits. Third,</p>
<p>(2) Loans and Investments. The total balance of the Bank's loans and investments in the 23rd year was more than 214.891 million yuan, an increase of more than 35.792 million yuan compared with the 22nd year, and an increase of more than 50.636 million yuan compared with the 21st year. The balance of fixed loans was more than 63.7 million yuan, an increase of more than 10.987 million yuan compared with the 22nd year, and an increase of more than 13.318 million yuan compared with the 21st year. The balance of current loans was more than 120.958 million yuan, an increase of more than 23.1421 million yuan compared with the 22nd year. The balance of discounted loans was more than 6.86 million yuan, an increase of more than 4.442 million yuan compared with the 22nd year, and an increase of more than 5.361 million yuan compared with the 21st year. The balance of marketable securities was more than 23.371 million yuan, a decrease of more than 2.779 million yuan compared with the 22nd year, and an increase of more than 775,000 yuan compared with the 21st year. Except for marketable securities belonging to the investment part, the total balance of the three loan items of fixed, current, and discounted loans in this year was more than 191.52 million yuan, which is more than 38.572 million yuan compared with the balance of more than 152.947 million yuan in the 22nd year. The content of all increases can be analyzed as follows: (To be continued)</p>

<h3>Zhengfeng Basketball Team Defeats Tongwen</h3>

<h3>Illustrated Explanation of Track and Field Training (2)</h3>
<p>(Translated by Jiang Lianggui, no reproduction allowed)</p>
<p>(Figure 2) To ensure correct posture, athletes must first have a deep understanding that the javelin, after being released, must avoid vibration during its flight in the air. Although javelins are mostly made of strong wood, avoiding vibration is indeed not easy. Furthermore, the distance and type of run vary from person to person due to different habits. Based on the author's personal experience, the "hop step" is superior to the "crossover step." Mixing the two methods is also acceptable. Adding a crossover step before the hop step can focus the athlete's attention on the final hop step to maintain body balance and concentrate all strength on the throw. The above figure shows the posture using the crossover step, noting that the right foot has moved in front of the left foot, and the right arm holding the javelin is gradually moving backward in preparation for the throw.</p>

<h3>Jiangsu Education Director Zhou Fo Hai Inspects Xuzhou and Hai Education</h3>
<p>Personally Inspects Various Elementary Schools, Giving Instructions to Teachers and Staff - The Public is Deeply Moved by His Inspection of Social Education in the Countryside</p>
<p>(Xuzhou Express News) Since Jiangsu Education Director Zhou Fohai and his party arrived in Xuzhou, they have been extremely busy inspecting education.

The atmosphere was very intense. He also instructed the film technician to film this kind of children's activity. Then, he went to the Shaohua Street Elementary School for a detailed inspection. In the afternoon at 4:00 PM, he addressed more than 2,000 middle school students in the county at the County People's Education Hall, saying that Xuzhou has a very good folk customs: (1) hardworking and enduring; (2) forthright and honest; (3) brave and resolute. However, the general level of students is relatively low. In the future, they should promote and carry forward their strengths and remedy their weaknesses. The speech lasted for two hours.

They then went to Yangzhuang to visit the chicken farming business. At noon, they arrived in Shiqiao and gathered local elders to talk about local customs and folk conditions, and the lives of the people in great detail. After dinner, they toured the famous Jing Mountain Bridge, which is more than three miles long, and praised the greatness of the bridge, which he had never seen in the southeast. They entered a mountain cave, which was about dozens of feet deep, with an entrance like a hole. After walking more than a hundred steps, it suddenly opened up, and there were carvings. It is said that it was used as a refuge by the ancestors, and it also seemed like a very ancient tomb passage. Zhou appreciated it very much. When returning to the city, he went to Wangzai to visit the warehouse business and talked with the people. An old man over eighty years old smiled and sang on the side of the road, and the children and women competed to applaud, which was a great scene. At 5:00 PM, he rested at the People's Education Hall, and at 6:00 PM, he broadcast a speech to the people in social education, listing the necessary conditions for social education personnel, such as (1) a lively spirit, (2) a humble attitude, (3) a persevering will, and (4) an interest in the cause.

<p>The law students of various private universities in this city believe that the temporary judicial officer examination organized by the Ministry of Judicial Administration in September this year is limited to graduates of national universities with a score of 80 or above, which seems unfair to the examination rights of various registered schools.

<p>Special Issue in Commemoration of the May First Labor Day</p>
<h3>Foreword</h3>
<p>— Lu Jingshi</p>
<p>The occurrence and development of May First Labor Day has been fifty years in history. The Chinese Labor Association was established just after the 50th anniversary of the occurrence of May First Labor Day. At the same time, the publication of a special commemorative issue on the 50th anniversary of this May First has a more profound and significant meaning.</p>
<p>Commemorating May First Labor Day is a common international practice. However, while the principles of commemoration are the same, the meaning of commemoration has national and local characteristics. We, the Chinese laborers, should recognize the spirit of the times, grasp the concept of Chinese orientation, and determine the meaning and mission of our commemoration of May First Labor Day.</p>
<p>Commemoration is not an illusory matter, but a magnificent action. In our commemoration, we must hold the correct meaning and bear the current mission.</p>
<p>In order to indicate the correct meaning and the current great mission of this commemoration, the Chinese Labor Association has launched this special commemorative issue. The texts inside are the expressions of the experience and thoughts of the leaders of the actual labor movement in the party and government circles, as well as academic experts in the labor field. It openly reveals the great path that the Chinese labor circle should take in the future. In short, this short page not only deeply depicts the method of commemoration, but also further formulates a concrete plan for the Chinese-oriented labor movement in the future.</p>
<p>We hope that all compatriots across the country will accept this plan, and everyone will stand under the common goal of "labor service" advocated by Chairman Chiang Kai-shek, and jointly promote the success of the national liberation movement and the progress of the future of labor welfare.</p>
<h3>May First Festival</h3>
<p>— Cheng Haifeng</p>
<p>The May First Festival is here again!</p>
<p>Looking back to this day forty-nine years ago, all the workers in the United States stopped working and marched in demonstrations, chanting in unison:—</p>
<p>"From now on, no worker,</p>
<p>Should work more than eight hours!</p>
<p>Eight hours for work, eight hours for education, eight hours for rest."</p>
<p>The notorious Haymarket affair, a historical tragedy, thus occurred because of this demand for an eight-hour workday. At the same time, it opened a path of blood for the liberation of workers worldwide.</p>
<p>In 1889, the Second International held its founding congress in Paris, deciding to designate May 1st as International Labor Day. Since then, workers in various countries have commemorated the May First Festival every year.</p>
<p>The commemoration of the May First Festival is a relatively recent phenomenon in China. When Shanghai workers held a large-scale celebration of the May First Festival in the thirteenth year of the Republic [1924], they also sang the Eight-Hour Labor Commemoration Song, which included a passage:</p>
<p>"Heaven creates happiness for people, twenty-four hours day and night, the three-eight system is fair and reasonable, eight hours for work, eight hours for education, eight hours for rest, working for food, clothing, and shelter, it is unreasonable not to work and eat."</p>
<p>The original demand of the May First Festival was to reduce working hours, only working eight hours a day. Since the first May First Festival until today, countless economic, social, and political changes have taken place. This demand has also gradually been realized along with these changes. However, most countries are still unwilling to implement it. Of course, each country has its own unique circumstances that do not allow them to do so. But a major reason is the lack of binding international agreements. They are all afraid that if their country reduces working hours while other countries do not, it will affect their competitiveness in the market. The charter of the International Labour Organization also pointed out, "If any country does not adopt humane labor protection laws, it will inevitably hinder the progress of other countries' labor protection policies as a result of global economic competition." Therefore, at its first meeting, the International Labour Conference formulated a draft convention limiting industrial workers to eight hours of work per day and forty-eight hours per week, in order to simultaneously promote the eight-hour system in all countries through international agreements.</p>
<p>From the fact that the International Labour Conference uses international conventions to regulate the eight-hour workday, we can see that before the establishment of the International Labour Organization, workers' demands relied entirely on their own domestic demonstrations and movements to obtain them. Since the establishment of the International Labour Organization, all workers' demands can be raised at the International Labour Conference, discussed jointly with governments and employers, and an international convention can be formulated for all countries to follow simultaneously. In this way, each country's improvement of domestic labor conditions will not be halted because other countries have not improved. Moreover, all demands and plans for improvement can be calmly discussed at the conference based on facts to find appropriate solutions, without having to resort to severe means of demonstration to promote their realization. This is a significant progress! It should be known that the purpose of the International Labour Organization is to raise the status of workers and improve their lives, but it does not advocate using radical methods, but rather advocates adopting a policy of cooperation between the government, employers, and labor. This policy is the same in seeking welfare for labor, and at the same time, it can avoid all kinds of meaningless sacrifices and disturbances. We should uphold this peaceful approach when commemorating the May First Festival!</p>
<p>Since the first International Labour Conference (in 1919) to date, sixteen years have passed, and countless changes have taken place in the world's economic and social landscape. Not to mention anything else, just taking the issue of working hours, the system of eight hours a day and forty-eight hours a week stipulated in the previous sixteen years is now under the impact of economic panic, technological progress, and the increasing number of unemployed, and it is already in a situation where it can no longer be maintained. Consequently, the system of forty hours of work per week has emerged. This demand will be raised again at this year's International Labour Conference (opening in Geneva on June 4), and it is hoped that it can be resolved smoothly.</p>
<p>Forty-nine years ago, the workers used their blood to exchange for the eight-hour workday, but the result was not entirely satisfactory. Now, for the demand to reduce working hours, it is no longer necessary to obtain it through sacrifice, but only to strive for it at the International Labour Conference—a world industrial conference—and conversely, excellent results can be obtained. The changes and difficulties involved are truly immeasurable. This way of striving for the interests of workers through peaceful means and international cooperation is truly a great social progress! Therefore, when we commemorate the May First Festival, we should support the International Labour Organization, which seeks labor benefits through peaceful means and international cooperation!</p>
<p>The world and domestic economic recession has lasted for an unprecedentedly long time, and the lives of workers have also been affected as a result. Therefore, for the sake of their own interests, workers should not only study all world and domestic economic activities in detail, but also directly participate in them, in order to save the bleak situation and restore prosperity.</p>
<p>Among the many conditions for seeking labor benefits, a sound basic trade union organization is a very important condition. But how can we improve the basic organization of trade unions? Among the many ways, labor education is the most important. In order for workers to receive adequate education, they must be literate. Now, the Northern Government is working hard on the literacy movement to eliminate illiteracy. Workers should give the government all kinds of assistance, eliminate illiteracy among workers, and increase the number of literate people, in preparation for the implementation of labor education.</p>
<p>Based on what has been said above, when commemorating this year's "May First Festival," workers should strive for the following points:</p>
<p>(1) Support the International Labour Organization, which seeks labor benefits through conferences, in order to promote social justice and achieve the goal of maintaining world and domestic peace.</p>
<p>(2) Participate in various economic activities to save the world and domestic economic decline, in order to improve the working conditions and lives of workers, and to achieve the goal of raising the status of workers and promoting economic construction.</p>
<p>(3) Assist the government in handling labor literacy campaigns, in order to implement labor education, and to achieve the goal of improving the basic organization of trade unions.</p>
<h3>Developing Production and Labor-Management Coordination</h3>
<p>— (Wu Shaoshu)</p>
<p>The song "From now on, a worker, eight hours for work, eight hours for rest, eight hours for education" has now spread throughout the world. The toiling workers, following this inspiring song, have gained a portion of liberation. The result was the moving and admirable "May First" Labor Day. This was still in the year 1886 of the Western calendar.</p>
<p>Originally, society is an organism. If humans want to survive, they must labor. Whether it is mental or physical labor, labor is always sacred. The demand for the eight-hour system is indeed a right that laborers should enjoy.</p>
<p>However, in today's world, the economic collectivism and political groupism of various imperialists are constantly mutually exclusive. At the same time, the concrete implementation of economic policies such as tariff barriers, inflation, cheap dumping, and currency disputes fully demonstrates the hideous face of selfishness and self-interest. Laborers in this abnormal and tense situation, feeling compelled by economic panic, are uneasy about their own lives and inevitably groan under the control of harsh environments. Moreover, the high tide of labor unemployment is gradually surging, further forming an intensification of economic panic—as seen most recently in the United States! This mutually causal relationship makes laborers fall into misfortune.</p>
<p>The environment of the world's labor community is like this. What about China? Naturally, it cannot be an exception. Not only can it not be an exception, but it is even worse. In addition to being affected by the world economic panic, this is naturally because China itself is a market under the capital power of the powers. Moreover, natural and man-made disasters in the country have come one after another. Rural bankruptcy and social turmoil have made the weak capital and entrepreneurial capabilities of industry have to rely on the capital power of imperialism for breathing. With the decline of their own business, the improvement of workers' treatment is, of course, out of the question. When workers' demands are more serious, they can only close the factory to deal with it. As a result, the unemployed only increase batch by batch, disputes arise repeatedly, and there is no way to solve them. This is still the phenomenon of the industrial sector. As for state-owned enterprises and other industries, they are also struggling to survive in a storm. Under the control of this environment, the entire life and future of the Chinese labor community is only shaky and bleak.</p>
<p>So how can we save this crisis? In my personal opinion, there are the following two points:</p>
<p>(1) Actively developing production: China's economy is backward, and the country's inherent capital is extremely weak, so the production industry is sluggish.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen advocated in the Principle of People's Livelihood to create state capital from a proactive aspect to develop industry; and to first implement the protection of private capital, and then develop state-owned enterprises. Because the productivity of private enterprises has always been greater than that of state productivity, if private capital is concentrated, then the country's enterprises can naturally develop at an accelerated rate. In this way, the country's goods can compete with the goods of imperialism to develop industry and sell off China's surplus labor. However, the development of production must make use of machinery, and the large-scale mechanical production undertakings that cannot be carried out by private individuals must be developed by state capital and operated by the state. In this way, on the one hand, appropriate production can be carried out according to the degree of market needs, avoiding all kinds of unnecessary consumption of private operation; at the same time, on the other hand, the profits obtained from production are owned by the public and used as resources for material construction, which can correct the trend of unequal distribution. Moreover, the result of this kind of state-owned industry is the socialization of production technology, and large-scale industries can especially absorb a large number of unemployed laborers. Therefore, to save the crisis of the Chinese labor community, the first is to develop production, so that the country's production industry can get rid of the shackles of the capital forces of the powers, and it is also a medicine against the world economic panic.</p>
<p>(2) Passive labor-management coordination: To make production develop, the need for financial resources is, of course, a basic condition; and the cooperation of human resources is also indispensable. Because if labor and management do not oppress each other and can understand each other and then fully cooperate, this can not only be developed in their own business, but also the treatment of laborers can be gradually improved. Originally, the conflict between employers and laborers—the class struggle recognized by the Communist Party—was a kind of morbidity in the process of social evolution, which should only be corrected, not expanded. Moreover, Chinese labor and management have not formed a class opposition at all? What should be considered is only a question of reconciling the interests of both labor and management.</p>
<p>Sun Yat-sen once said: "...On the side of the capitalists, they can produce more products, and on the side of the workers, they can also get more wages. This is the harmony of the interests of capitalists and workers, not a conflict. The reason why society has evolved is that the vast majority of economic interests in society are in harmony, not in conflict..." Therefore, labor-management coordination is not to make capitalists oppress workers, but to solve the survival problem of both labor and management. The crisis in the labor community is becoming more and more urgent, and the lives of laborers are becoming more and more painful. We want to improve the treatment, but the environment requires us to work hard. We have to work hard on the above two things—developing production and labor-management coordination—to save the crisis in the labor community and improve the lives of laborers.</p>
<h3>The Significance of May First in the Era</h3>
<p>— Zhu Xuefan</p>
<p>The tragic and great "May First" Festival is coming again.</p>
<p>"May First" is the price of the baptism of blood of the laboring masses all over the world! It not only opened a bright blood path for the oppressed all over the world, but also established the most powerful layer of guarantee for human peace!</p>
<p>European and American workers, in order to seek equality and liberation, have undergone countless heroic bloodshed and decades of sacrifice and struggle, before obtaining the realization of the "eight hours for work, eight hours for education, eight hours for rest" three-eight system. The status and personality of labor have begun to be valued by the general public. Now the three-eight system has almost been recognized as the most reasonable principle by the whole world. This cannot but be attributed to the heroic struggle of the martyrs. Therefore, the glorious history and great significance of May First cannot be erased and is always worth our commemoration and praise! Especially in the current stage of China, we must have an accurate understanding!</p>
<p>At present, China is suffering from an unprecedentedly serious national crisis in history. There are strong neighbors invading outside, and the lost land has not been recovered. Inside, there are bandits and disasters year after year, and the industry has collapsed. The origin of these national crises is all caused by the political and economic aggression of imperialism. The laboring masses are directly and indirectly under the iron hoof of imperialism, so the suffering they suffer is the most intense! Not only has the "three-eight system" not been realized, but even the minimum standard of living cannot be maintained. Unemployment and joblessness fill the whole country, which is clearly different from the living conditions of European and American workers.</p>
<p>The special environment determines the special trend of the Chinese labor movement.</p>
<p>Therefore, the object of the Chinese laboring masses' pursuit of liberation should be imperialism, not any class in the country. The means adopted is not the suicidal policy of class struggle, but to increase national productivity with the spirit of labor service, to build the foundation of the country, and to enrich the national self-defense force. At the same time, under the leadership of the supreme leader's movement to revive the nation, we must strengthen our belief, concentrate our strength, tighten our iron fists, follow the blood path of the martyrs, and destroy our current enemy—imperialism—in order to seek a common way out for the nation.</p>
<h3>The Purpose and Process of Editing This Publication</h3>
<p>— Zhao Shusheng</p>
<p>After the editing, please allow me to represent my colleagues in the compilation and translation section of this association and say a few words briefly.</p>
<p>First, the editing of this publication was made after the solemn resolution of the board of directors of this association. Its purpose has been said a little in the publication's opening remarks. In short, this is our first attempt and also a contribution of this association to the newly established labor academic circle. We certainly welcome criticisms and discussions from all walks of life across the country.</p>
<p>Second, the original plan was to publish it simultaneously in this newspaper and the Morning Post and the News Report with the same content, but as a result of the authors' generous contributions, the amount of text exceeded twice the fixed space that each newspaper could accommodate. Therefore, we had to adopt the method of separate publication, publishing the great works of Mr. Wu Xieya, Zhang Jianbai, Chen Zhenlu, Wang Yongsheng, Chen Xiaocen, and other gentlemen in the Morning Post, while the News Report published the great works of Mr. Wu Kaixian, Wu Huan, Sun Xiaolou, Fu Dewei, Chen Wenbin. I would like to ask the authors and readers to forgive the matter of being forced to do this due to space limitations.</p>

<h3>Finance Silver Prices Continue to Fall, Standard Gold Price Rebounds Eleven Yuan and Three Cents</h3>
<p>Public bonds for May begin settlement today; yesterday, only about 14% of shorts covered their positions.</p>
<p>Yesterday's gold market saw a continuous drop in British and American silver prices, leading to an initial rise in the market. However, sentiment remained normal, and the market experienced some weakness mid-day. Nevertheless, Chinese banks, such as the National Goods Bank and the Continental Bank, scrambled for U.S. dollars, causing the foreign exchange market to tighten. The market ultimately strengthened again. Early in the morning, news came from overseas that British and American silver markets were continuing their downward trend. However, large players stated that the market was extremely firm after closing, with transactions occurring above the closing price. The forward silver price in Montreux also narrowed by four to eleven cents. Exchange rates remained high, and London raw gold fell back by ten and a half pence. In pre-market trading, the market opened at sixty-four yuan and five cents, immediately rising to sixty-five yuan. The Central Bank's listed price was announced, with British currency stable and American currency rising. The customs gold unit fell by one cent, and the standard gold price dropped to 830 yuan and nine cents. Major players took advantage of the high prices to sell, pushing the price down to within sixty yuan. However, the morning opening remained high. After the opening, the exchange market hardened, and Sassoon continued to offer dollars, stimulating selling pressure and causing a downward trend. National Goods Bank moved to acquire U.S. dollar holdings, stabilizing sentiment. After hitting a low, buyers gradually became active, and the domestic market also tightened, allowing for a pull-up. The price rebounded to above sixty yuan, and banks seized the opportunity to offer dollars at a higher price. HSBC's listed price was announced, with British currency stable and American currency rising by 1.875 cents, then falling back to within sixty yuan. After fluctuating, the market showed some instability and declined. However, it was soon pulled up again. Demand exceeded supply, and available funds remained scarce, pushing the price above sixty yuan. There were frequent rebounds, but selling pressure was high after the gains, making it easy for the price to fall back. Thereafter, the price fluctuated around sixty yuan for quite some time. At noon, buying sentiment was temporarily revived, but the upward momentum was still temporary, mainly because the transaction volume was not large, and the market situation seemed to be turning volatile. In the after-market, the price dropped from above sixty yuan to fifty-eight or fifty-nine yuan. The initial quote for Indian silver was a small 6.4.4 anna, but it stabilized again. After a slight consolidation after the opening, bank buying activity strengthened, and the price stood outside the sixty-yuan mark, gradually rising. The Continental Bank and others continued to acquire U.S. dollars, causing the foreign exchange market to tighten. Hedging activities then came into play, stimulating buying sentiment. Major players also slightly covered their short positions. There was a lack of supply in the market, leading to repeated ten-yuan increases, once approaching the seventy-yuan mark. Major players took advantage of the high prices to sell, gradually leading to a decline. Rumors of a second rise in Indian silver by two annas or no change slightly calmed sentiment. However, bank buying interest remained strong, and the gold market was surrounded by buying pressure again, leading to another rally. In the end, due to the double-settlement price relationship, the market showed a volatile trend. The day's market was weak and then bullish, with the overall trend being mediocre.

There were very few large transactions in the field, and scattered entries and exits were relatively lively, and if the trend was strong, it would not be difficult to cause a fall, and if it fell sharply, the rebound would be strong, but it would not be easy to have major fluctuations during this period of brewing, yesterday's experience, the word stable is enough to do all, there were not many transactions, and the human heart was stable, from the opening in the morning to the opening in the afternoon, and the three-disc transactions were not active, and the market price was almost the same, each disc was slightly better than five points, one point to one point and a half points, and the closing was slightly chaotic, and the rises and falls could not be consistent, but because the transactions were clearer, the ups and downs were more slight, and it was not that the trend had turned, and the result of the market price was a continued increase of five points, one point to two points and a half, and the total number of transactions was 4,375,000 yuan, and the result of its rise and fall is listed on the left, (unit yuan, transaction unit hundred yuan)</p>

<h3>New York Stock Market Stagnant and Uneven</h3>
<p>Xinfeng Foreign Bank reports yesterday (29th) New York Stock Market, ups and downs, stagnant and uneven, one is because the silver price is loose, two is because the US Steel Corporation reported that steel production decreased by 1.5% to 43.1%, and three is because President Roosevelt still insisted on abolishing public securities companies, until before the close, the Supreme Court's ruling on the railway workers' pension case had not yet been announced, which triggered the purchase of railway stocks. At the same time, although the Ministry of Finance was conservative about the silver problem, speculators believed that the outlook for silver was still very optimistic, and the market situation recovered. Stocks, bonds, and debt markets in the small text easy place were less軒軒, and the total turnover for the day was 650,000 shares. The Dow Jones Index is listed on the left.</p>

<h3>Yarn and Cotton After Delivery, Standard Yarn Price Lingers</h3>
<p>The yarn market was weak in the morning and firm at noon, but the market situation is again in a spiral. After delivery, both long and short parties are holding a wait-and-see attitude, so the buying and selling in the market is quite fresh, and the market disc lacks changes, but most opinions are that selling is bearish, because a certain gentleman's long position has given up, turned short in the May period, or has concerns about delivery, and observing the subsequent steps, whether a certain gentleman delivers the goods or not is a very big point of the market price rising and falling.</p>
<p>Recent Yarn is Oppressed</p>
<p>In the opening of the standard yarn front market, the market conditions of each month showed a soft appearance, and the seller's oppression has been strong recently, falling by six and seven cents, and the distance has fallen by three or four cents. After shooting to the first and third discs, Dafu acting for a certain company bought more than 1,000 packages, and the market atmosphere suddenly turned firm. As a result, each month fell by one, two or two cents compared with the previous day's close, but this month fell by five cents. The market situation was relatively firm after the noon opening, and there were few transactions in the market, but the table was still tough. As a result, each month rose by one, two or three cents compared with the morning closing price. It was found that Yuda sold 450 packages, Hexing 1,050 packages, Renfeng 600 packages, Yuanyi 550 packages, Taichang 450 packages, and Mingde 800 packages, while Dafu bought 1,950 packages, Xinchang 400 packages, Junchang 1,100 packages, Changyu 300 packages, Runkang 1,200 packages, and Yichang 350 packages. The highest and lowest prices and closing prices for the day are as follows:</p>

<h3>Excellent Public Sentiment Among Cotton Futures Traders</h3>
<p>The cotton market is trending upward, but both American and Indian cotton markets are falling, while silver is declining. Gold futures are stable, so public sentiment is good. Half of the traders lean toward going long, resulting in a strong upward pull. However, current cotton sales remain sluggish, due to stagnant yarn prices.</p>
<p>Possible Tax Increase on Foreign Cotton</p>
<p>In the morning session of cotton futures trading, near-month contracts were weak, with more sellers than buyers. Although silver prices shrank significantly, gold futures prices remained flat. American cotton fell 7 points, and Indian cotton fell 11.3 rupees. Therefore, public sentiment was still somewhat subdued, and sellers slightly increased their offers, but trading was quiet, and market prices changed little. As a result, contracts for all months fell by 5 to 10 points compared to the previous day's closing price, except for August, which rose by 10 points.</p>
<p>In the afternoon, the trading floor suddenly tightened, and inventory became scarce. According to market sources, there is talk of increased taxes on imported foreign cotton starting in July, which further boosted public sentiment and caused prices to rise. As a result, contracts for all months rose by 5 to 10 points compared to the morning closing price. Sold contracts included 2,400 bales of Sui Long, 1,300 bales of Mingde, 1,600 bales of Dachangcheng, 1,000 bales of Yuantian, 900 bales of Shengyuan, 700 bales of Xincheng, and 700 bales of Runkang. Purchased contracts included 3,500 bales of Dafu, 1,400 bales of Dafeng, 1,500 bales of Yuan Yi, 1,400 bales of Yuanxingchang, 1,000 bales of Gengfeng, 1,400 bales of Changhe, 900 bales of Shengyuan, and 900 bales of Changfeng. The highest, lowest, and closing prices for the day were as follows:</p>
<p>Cotton Futures Highest Price Lowest Price Closing Price Change Open Interest</p>
<p>May Contract 33.60 33.35 33.55 -- 140,500</p>
<p>June Contract 34.00 33.80 33.95 -- 187,000</p>
<p>July Contract 34.55 34.35 34.55 Up 0.10 198,400</p>
<p>August Contract 34.65 34.45 34.65 Up 0.20 141,600</p>
<p>Total 667,000</p>
<p>Sluggish Demand from Factories</p>
<p>Current cotton sales remain sluggish. Due to falling yarn prices, factories are unwilling to replenish their raw material inventory. Incoming supplies included 610 bales of Yaohua cotton and 250 bales of Tonghua cotton.</p>
<p>Tianjin American Cotton 47.25 Shanghai factory intake 400 bales delivered to the factory</p>
<p>Also 47.25 Shenxin factory intake 150 bales Also</p>
<p>Tongzhou Cotton 42.50 Also 500 bales Also</p>
<h3>Many Changes in Yarn and Cotton Grading for October Futures</h3>
<p>The Yarn Exchange convened a Cotton Yarn Review Committee on April 27 to inspect the substitute cotton yarn to be delivered for the October futures contract this year. As a result, the premium for 20-count Double Fish yarn produced by the Wuxi Qingfeng Factory was reduced from 4 yuan to 3 yuan. The discount for 20-count Waking Lion yarn produced by the Taicang Litai Factory was reduced from 2 yuan to 3 yuan, both lowered by 1 yuan. The discount for 16-count Earth yarn produced by the Xinyu Factory was reduced from 16 yuan to 17 yuan, and the discount for 10-count Hongfu yarn produced by the Zhentai Factory was reduced from 45 yuan to 46 yuan. 16-count Double Fish and 10-count Double Fish yarns produced by the Wuxi Qingfeng Factory were newly added to the grading table, starting from the October contract. The revised procedures and grade prices are listed below:</p>

<h3>Waiting for Silver Price Development; American Cotton Trading is Very Quiet</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the American cotton market was inactive as traders waited for silver price developments and government plans for the textile and cotton industries. At the opening, prices for all months fell by 5 to 9 points due to profit-taking by bulls and hesitancy among buyers who believed that prices were approaching the 12-cent loan level, which might trigger sales of Southern "hoarded cotton." Subsequently, the market continued to weaken as recent rain in the West was considered beneficial. Although selling pressure was not strong at this time, buyers were also waiting for new catalysts, so business was very quiet. Later, some local short positions engaged in hedging, resulting in a slight rebound, and the market closed steadily. Spot prices fell 5 points, and futures prices fell 3 to 9 points. English cotton spot prices fell 7 points, and futures prices fell 96 points. Indian cotton initially fell due to European exporters dumping new cotton but rebounded due to mass buying. Pingguo'er fell 2.5 rupees, Aomula fell 2.75 to 3 rupees, and Bailuoxi fell 1.5 to 2.5 rupees. The original telegraph recording is on the left (dated the 29th).</p>

<p>Also, according to a Bombay telegram, the opening forecast for the July-August Bailuoxi cotton contract on the 30th was 136.5 rupees, unchanged.</p>
<h3>Rangoon Cotton Exports</h3>
<p>According to a Bombay telegram on the 29th, the amount of cotton exported from Rangoon last week was 2,000 bales, including 965 bales to Hamburg, 235 bales to Liverpool, 600 bales to Kobe, and 200 bales to Bremen.</p>
<h3>Calm Cotton Sales in Tianjin</h3>
<p>Tianjin correspondence: The cotton market remains sluggish, prices are calm, and sales are not extensive. Donghe long-staple cotton merchants bought 100 bales at an asking price of 44 yuan. Bianchang merchants bought 50 bales of red cotton at an asking price of 24 to 28 yuan. Also, the Shanxi cotton market is still good, and factory intake has not decreased, maintaining a stable trend. Beisha Factory bought 120 bales at an asking price of 41.5 yuan, and another 100 bales at a price of 40 yuan.</p>
<h3>Grains: River Rice Initially Weak, then Tight</h3>
<p>(South Shanghai) Yesterday, supplies from various regions suddenly surged, totaling over 50 merchants (goods totaling over 10,000 shih). Public sentiment was further discouraged, and sales in this district were unusually stagnant, causing prices of various goods to decline. Later, fortunately, large merchants from Tianjin and Weihaiwei suddenly moved to purchase over 1,000 packages, stabilizing the market. At the same time, merchants in this district also began to move. Except for South Port Indica rice, which was mostly purchased by larger shops and experienced little fluctuation, Su Tong glutinous rice and various late-season Indica rice varieties saw slight price adjustments of nearly 10 points. Inferior Yuan rice lacked flavor and was particularly favored. However, most preferred high-quality goods, while mid-quality goods were indifferent.</p>
<p>(North Shanghai) Yesterday, few boats arrived from downstream, approximately 10 merchants. Various goods in the market were sold off, with white glutinous rice slightly changing, and prices were uncertain. Thin Indica rice was scarce, and prices remained firm. Early rice had balanced arrivals and sales, and prices did not fluctuate. High-quality white Yuan materials were actively delivered, while mid-quality and inferior goods were normal. Market prices were slightly higher by nearly 10 points, while mid-quality and inferior goods remained stable. Other goods also showed stability.</p>
<h3>Imported Rice Prices Reported to be Rising Again at Origin</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the imported rice market was quite active due to rising prices at origin. Speculators had good sentiment, and domestic sales remained strong. Yesterday, another 13,000 to 14,000 packages were sold in the market. In addition to strong demand from inland areas, there were also purchases from the Yangtze River, Ningbo, Shaoxing, northern ports, and merchants from this district, totaling over 10,000 packages. Futures, returning goods, and transit goods also opened at 1,200 tons. As the market became active, public sentiment further improved. However, due to sufficient inventory, prices only increased by 3 to 5 points. Ke Xian rice also opened at over 1,000 packages, and prices also followed suit, increasing by 2 to 3 points, it is said.</p>
<h3>Tianjin Merchants Account for the Majority of Deliveries for This Month's Settlement</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the settlement date for April wheat flour futures. It was reported that only 2,000 packages of Green Troopship flour were actually delivered through the exchange. However, it was reported that the number of self-settled transactions outside the exchange was as high as 500,000 packages, with approximately 400,000 packages of Troopship flour and over 100,000 packages of Red Basket Car flour. 90% were purchased by Tianjin merchants, with the remainder being small quantities sold by merchants in this district. It was also reported that Tianjin merchants, in addition to purchasing the standard, also opened orders for 50,000 packages of Green Fort flour at a price of 1.5 yuan. Sales in northern districts are unusually brisk, reportedly due to wind damage, causing demand to rise everywhere, leading to continuous purchases.</p>

<h3>Inland Areas Increase Soybean and Bean Cake Purchases</h3>
<p>Yesterday was the settlement date for miscellaneous grains this month. Wheat had been mostly settled privately beforehand, so there was no delivery. Due to short selling, both parties became trapped with soybeans, resulting in a significant number of deliveries. 85 carloads of train soybeans, 10 carloads of standard soybeans, and 12,000 pieces of bean cake were delivered. Buyers were all merchants from inland areas. Oil was also settled privately, with no deliveries, it is said.</p>
<h3>North and South Goods: Peanut Kernel Sales Show Slight Improvement</h3>
<p>Recently, sales of peanut kernels to Guangdong and Shantou merchants have become more active. Transactions have occurred in the past two days. The day before yesterday, merchants bought one carload of Kaifeng kernels at 7.05 yuan, Shandong kernels at 6.4 yuan, Dangshan kernels at 6.05 yuan, and Guide kernels at 6.2 yuan, totaling 300 packages. Yesterday, prices rose by 10 to 5 points. Guangdong and Shantou merchants bought a total of 100 tons. Dangshan and Guide kernels were priced at 6.3 to 6.5 yuan, and Tancheng kernels were priced at 6.65 yuan to 6.75 yuan, and 6.75 yuan.</p>
<h3>Sugar Market: 6,000 Packages of Distant-Term Dutch White Sugar Transacted</h3>
<p>Yesterday, the sugar market softened again as customs gold fell further, reaching a low of 1.636 before slightly recovering to 1.648. The Sugar Association quoted 16.6 yuan for spot Dutch coarse white sugar, down 10 points, and 5.3 yuan for re-export goods, but no transactions occurred. Local factory refined white sugar also fell 10 points, with Zhenyu No. 1 at 16 yuan, No. 2 at 15.9 yuan, No. 3 at 15.75 yuan, and No. 4 at 15.6 yuan. Chaozhou merchants offered over 100 packages of No. 4 goods at 12.2 to 12.3 yuan, unchanged from before.</p>
<p>The Dachang Foreign Firm offered 6,000 packages of distant-term Dutch coarse white sugar for delivery in June, July, August, and September at a price of 3.15 Dutch guilders, excluding new regulations and taxes.</p>
<p>Another message: East Sugar's quoted prices also fell yesterday, with YP brand at 16.4 yuan and YRO brand at 16.1 yuan, and transactions occurred.</p>
<h3>Silk and Tea: New Green Tea Opened Yesterday</h3>
<p>70% Lower Than Last Year</p>
<p>Following the listing of new tea from Tuzhuang the day before, new samples of Chunmei green tea from Wenzhou continued to be released yesterday. After two days of negotiations between Chinese and foreign parties, Tianyu Foreign Firm opened the first batch. Tuzhuang Chunmei was priced at 75 yuan, and Wenzhou Chunmei was priced at 48 yuan, 70% lower than last year. This sharp drop is due to the appreciation of silver prices abroad and high exchange rates. According to current shilling calculations, British merchants' prices are equivalent to last year's, but tea sales abroad are far worse than before. Therefore, several foreign firms are taking a wait-and-see approach.</p>
<h3>Oilcloth: White Tung Oil Sales to Foreign Countries Still Strong</h3>
<p>After the price of white tung oil rose again after falling in Hankou, it became more stable than before. Although prices once fell to 35 yuan per tan, they quickly rose to 37.2 yuan, and recently to 38 yuan. According to foreign firms, demand from Europe and the United States is still strong, but prices above 40 yuan seem difficult to calculate. If it's 37 to 38 yuan, various countries are interested in purchasing. Therefore, foreign firms are paying close attention to the current market. The Hankou telegram reported that 10,000 to 20,000 barrels had already been sold at 38.2 yuan, and it is likely that there will be more continuous purchases.</p>
<h3>Piece Goods: The Decline of Woolen Cloth in April</h3>
<p>Normally, April is the busiest time for woolen cloth trading, as spring sales are in full swing and summer sales are starting. However, business has been sluggish in recent months, with mostly sporadic transactions, leading to an oversupply of goods and falling prices. In the past month, prices of various woolen cloths have fallen eight or nine times out of ten, with the remainder fluctuating up and down. The prices at the beginning and end of April are listed below for comparison:</p>

<h3>Tidbits</h3>
<p>— (Chen Yunsu)</p>
<p>Some say that Chinese education has the greatest transformative power. Just look at how ordinary rural children, once they drink from the well of school, immediately react to their own parents' laughable stupidity, the pitiful simplicity of their lives, the messy urine and feces of chickens, pigs, dogs, and geese, and the troublesome work of hoeing and weeding. They are always thinking of realizing their idealized life.</p>
<p>Some say that the current Chinese education is purely adopting a birdcage-style education. What does that mean? It means that groups of spirited youths, batches of innocent and lively students, once they step into the school gate, their freedom is immediately deprived. They are not allowed to develop any talent and, like birds in a cage, cannot fly high, forced to listen to professors talk nonsense, making them listless and lifeless.</p>
<h3>A Pilgrimage on Min Guo Road</h3>
<p>— Wu Bian</p>
<p>That "Min Guo Road" that borders the Chinese district and the French Concession, when we hear this road name, we will naturally feel the concept of the nation and, at the same time, we will imagine how magnificent this road is. However, if we pass by there and pay a little attention to observe, it will cause infinite sighs and pity! Because what is reflected there is completely the life of the hungry masses and the laboring classes. If we study it a little more, we can also find the crux of society and other problems.</p>
<p>The mainstay of revitalizing the market there is first and foremost those department stores. Indeed, Chinese and foreign department stores are mixed together: however, the department stores here are all from the 19th century and are not of the 1936 style. To be honest, they are the so-called "second-hand stalls." The second-hand stalls there can be said to be lined up in rows. The items displayed in each second-hand stall include stationery department fountain pens, all furniture department utensils, as well as clothing department clothes, hats, shoes, and socks, and odd miscellaneous items, all kinds are available. Their stall owners buy them at low prices and sell them to customers with a thicker profit. However, there, when buying and selling, there is absolutely no true or unwavering price. Bargaining and haggling will always differ by more than double, but the transaction is usually successful in the end.</p>
<p>In addition to the second-hand stalls, there is also a kind of "second-hand carrier." The scale is even smaller. They open their company store in a bamboo basket. The major goods bought and sold by the second-hand carrier are broken clothes and utensils. Probably what the second-hand stalls reject (second-hand stalls are set up beside the steps), the second-hand carrier still regards them as equal to cow dung and horse urine, and they can be used as outstanding products in their medicine cabinet.</p>
<p>There, one can often see the hungry masses holding things to sell to stalls or carriers; and one can often see many laboring classes selecting various necessities. But in their transactions, especially when selling to stalls or carriers, to see a bright and clear large silver dollar is as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns.</p>
<p>What can the form that is being projected on Min Guo Road symbolize?</p>
<h3>Coffin Door</h3>
<p>— Yun Xun</p>
<p>I must declare in advance that this article is not fanning the flames of superstition, but a realistic description of a custom.</p>
<p>I remember there is such a sentence in Autumn Water Xuan Letters, a poor secretary begs for money from people, "Ten knocks on the firewood door, nine remain unopened," that is not a coffin door, but a door made of firewood. There is also a couplet, "The wealth door welcomes green water, the auspicious household faces green mountains," that is just describing the scenery in front of the door and blessing oneself. This kind of coffin door is made of coffin boards and must have been slept in by a dead person for a long time before it is qualified to be selected as a coffin door! This custom in Haimen and Qidong counties in Jiangsu, near the sea, still circulates today. If you ask the rickshaw pullers in Shanghai, they can tell you everything in detail. As for how to dispose of the dead body? Buy a pottery urn, put the bones and skulls in it, and re-bury them. Generally, poor families do this coffin-selling business, but at the same time, there is an unbreakable rule, if no one continues to die, the previous coffin will never be sold, which is quite consistent with the idiom "metabolism." People who install coffin doors in their homes use them to suppress evil spirits, containing a myth of driving away misfortune and avoiding evil.</p>
<p>Scholars often suffer from a kind of "yin" disease (commonly known as tuberculosis), young men and women, unmarried and married, encounter a kind of injustice, pestering the patient endlessly, desperately attacking to complete a good thing. Although the patient does not directly state it, what do the family members see in this situation? They understand most of it and immediately try to set up a coffin door: It is said that in addition to making coffin doors, coffin boards are also used to make bed boards for patients. Its side effects can also be used to build fences and raise livestock. For example, if a pigpen is built with coffin boards, this group of pigs will not encounter plague: Coffin boards in Haimen and Qidong really have unexpected effects. Preparing two coffin doors has the implication of "Jiang Taigong is here, nothing is forbidden," and "Flying Bear Zhenzhai" is naturally in the ranks of elimination and lagging behind.</p>
<h3>Self-Combing</h3>
<p>— Zhang Muliang</p>
<p>The other day, I saw an article by Lan Shan in this column about amahs, and I felt it was worth saying something about. However, there are still many facts that Lan Shan did not say in detail: Now the "self-combing" I am writing is to explain the details more thoroughly.</p>
<p>Self-combing is originally another name for keeping chastity; this trend is of course most prevalent in Shunde County, Guangdong: Guangdong's amahs are also a specialty of Shunde. When these girls are seventeen or eighteen years old, they become sworn sisters with many little sisters and practice self-combing. Everyone chooses an auspicious day, and their parents come out to host a banquet, and then invite relatives, friends, and neighbors, declaring that their daughter has self-combed. From the day of self-combing, they comb their hair up, so the self-combing ceremony comes to a close.</p>
<p>In addition, wealthy self-combers and amah self-combers often travel to Sangjian and Pushang: Among the self-combing amahs, the so-called "close-fitting" type specializes in serving the young master's room, making beds, folding quilts, and combing the young mistress's hair, etc. The wages are very expensive, at least seven or eight yuan a month, and most of them are dozens of yuan: One more thing worth reporting to readers is that these self-combing amahs, because they specialize in serving the young master, often easily fall in love with the young master: Over time, they will even become concubines.</p>
<p>However, there is another type of "mirror-grinding party" that is similar to self-combing, and its harm is extraordinary; if someone is forced by their parents to marry someone from their party, they will not be polite and will implement various severe methods. On the day the marrying woman leaves, the sisters in this "mirror-grinding party" will secretly wrap the marrying woman tightly with cloth, and insert flower needles all over her body. On the wedding night, the groom is not allowed to get close to her. After three days of returning to her mother's house, the sisters must verify it. If it has been loosened or has had intercourse with the groom, they will definitely use various methods to kill the marrying woman. If it is really not loosened, then after returning to her mother's house after three days, she will never come to her husband's house again: Their parents are willing to pay money to the son-in-law and ask him to marry another concubine. From then on, except for the New Year and festivals and before death, they will never stay overnight or take a trip to her husband's house; if they stay overnight at her husband's house, they also sleep in separate rooms. Looking at this situation, the male really has to live a widower's life.</p>
<p>For the above facts, it is still very prevalent in Guangdong now, so I hope the local authorities will ban this kind of behavior that undermines morality and injures customs!</p>
<h3>Little Western Paradise</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhang Henshui</p>
<p>Chapter Twelve: Ashamed of Having No Clothes, Hanging Curtains to Avoid Guests, Diligently Saving Lamp Oil to Copy Books at Dawn</p>
<p>At the time, I subtly expressed this sentiment to the principal. According to him, desks and chairs were severely lacking, and the students had no suitable place to study other than the church. If they were to sit in the classroom all day, the method of studying would be too outdated. He had no choice but to let them study in the courtyard. After he said this, I became somewhat doubtful. Could it really be that the desks and chairs were such a problem? If that were indeed the case, then the education in the Northwest would be difficult to speak of. Therefore, I asked the principal to accompany me on a tour of the entire school. In reality, only two classrooms here were used for classes, and another was empty. There was only a dirt brick platform. One of the two classrooms was for senior students, and the desks inside were long tables with wooden tops, but the table legs were replaced with dirt bricks. The other classroom was for junior students, and although the desks and chairs were very dilapidated, they were similar to those used in ordinary primary schools. However, this classroom was essentially unnecessary. According to him, there were only five students in the school's junior class: one was the teacher's son, two were the principal's sons and nephew, and only two other ten-year-old students were recruited. However, their older brother was studying in the senior class; otherwise, these two students would not be here. Zhou Yourong said, "Is it so difficult to find twenty or thirty children to study in such a large county?" Zhiqian laughed, "County Magistrate Zhou, you have placed the word 'large' in 'such a large county' well. It is precisely because it is large and the population is too small. A village is only a few households, and they are separated by more than ten miles. Tell me, how can children under ten years old come to study? This is a matter of circumstance, and there is simply no solution." With this reason, we can understand that the students have delayed their age to a great extent, and that cannot be easily corrected. (194)</p>

<h3>Japanese Chrysanthemum Cultivation Techniques</h3>
<p>— Ji Yun</p>
<p>Japanese bonsai plants and trees are very famous. They also have considerable research into chrysanthemum cultivation. Recently, the time for chrysanthemum cultivation has arrived, and Japanese chrysanthemum expert Kiichiro Fukuchi has publicly shared his cultivation insights. The owner of the Violet Box also enjoys chrysanthemum cultivation and has translated them for reference. Domestic chrysanthemum enthusiasts will likely be pleased to hear about it.</p>
<p>From sprout insertion to blooming, chrysanthemums take about five months. Other bonsai plants may require ten or twenty years of cultivation, and the effort involved is incomparable. Because it blooms every autumn, failure this year can serve as a lesson for next year. In a short period, the art of chrysanthemum cultivation can gradually improve.</p>
<p>Chrysanthemum cultivation was very popular in Japan during the Tokugawa period, and judging competitions were established very early. The chrysanthemum figures favored by warriors and merchants were passed down during the Kyoho era. Small chrysanthemums (such as baby's breath) were more prosperous than large chrysanthemums. In recent times, large chrysanthemums have become the most popular. Tokyo has the Chrysanthemum Association and the Centennial Association, which specialize in planting large chrysanthemums and have more than 3,000 members. Medium-sized chrysanthemums were discovered in the Edo period and are called "standard chrysanthemums," the standard chrysanthemum. Noblemen such as Viscount Fukuha and Okuma were all stalwarts of the medium chrysanthemum party. There is now an organization called the Autumn Fragrance Association. Small chrysanthemums are specially made into cliff styles and the Evergreen Association manages this. Every year from November 3rd, a chrysanthemum exhibition is held in Hibiya Park, with various groups participating.</p>
<p>The variety of chrysanthemums is the largest of any horticultural plant in the world, with countless seeds. It can also be said that no two chrysanthemums are the same, because the flower shape, petals, and leaves always have some differences. Unless new seedlings are divided, no one can grow the same chrysanthemum. Because new varieties are constantly emerging, chrysanthemum cultivators do their best to make changes, which creates special interest.</p>
<p>Large chrysanthemums are divided into four types: broad tubular, thread-like, and dipper-shaped. Medium chrysanthemums are the most common and lush Higo chrysanthemums. Small chrysanthemums include literary chrysanthemums, mountain chrysanthemums, and Saga chrysanthemums. China's round chrysanthemums are Japan's ancient single-layered mountain chrysanthemums. Today's large chrysanthemums, which the Chrysanthemum Association and others pride themselves on as famous varieties, are a hybrid of Chinese and Japanese chrysanthemums. Chinese chrysanthemums are imported to Europe, where they are most widely propagated. As for the sixteen-petal dynastic emblem shape, it is a unique Japanese chrysanthemum.</p>
<p>The method of chrysanthemum cultivation is to first insert the buds into Kanuma soil, about two inches deep, and place them in a shady place for twenty days to root. One flower can be planted in a four-inch pot. Pinch off the neck in early June, and three to five branches can be obtained. Short ones about three and a half feet long and long ones about six feet long are most suitable. In mid-June, use bean dregs water twice a day until before the flowers bloom. Afterwards, just water them with plenty of fertilizer. Buds appear on September 15th, begin to open in early October, and are in full bloom around November 10th. Water once every morning, but do not water during the day. Use insecticide to remove insects every half day.</p>
<p>Adjusting the posture of chrysanthemums is the most difficult. The wind blows the flowers out of place, they are often exposed to sunlight, and the water easily dries out. Those with insufficient experience can only grow about fifty pots at most.</p>
<h3>The Imperial Incense Record</h3>
<p>— Originally by Princess Der Ling, translated by Qin Shouou</p>
<p>Ordinary wealthy families are already considered quite extravagant if each person makes a new set of clothes every ten days. However, the Empress Dowager's new clothes averaged one set a day, or even more than that. Wouldn't that be astounding? However, the tailors who made these court robes and embroidered garments were not women, but male eunuchs. Did they learn tailoring before becoming eunuchs, or did they become eunuchs first and then learn tailoring? I never investigated that! I only know that their skills were also the best of the best, definitely not comparable to outside tailors. But their daily lives were said to be different from those of the female artisans, probably a bit more difficult. Although they had to design most of their work themselves, they had to immediately comply with any changes the Empress Dowager wanted to make on a whim. They were not allowed to start working on a new set of clothes until the sample had been approved by the Empress Dowager; unlike the female shoemakers, who could make their own decisions, create a sample, and then start embroidering. However, this also led to even greater waste of shoes! Except for a very few pairs that deeply pleased the Empress Dowager, eighty or ninety percent of them were displayed year-round in rows in that enormous shoe warehouse like some kind of antique: they would be discarded after a certain period. If the court robes and embroidered garments were also like this, I'm afraid the silver in the imperial treasury would run out even faster!</p>
<p>Next, I must talk about the Empress Dowager's socks. I presume that there are quite a few older readers who can remember what kind of socks women wore twenty or thirty years ago. The Empress Dowager's socks were generally the same. The sock tops were very short, almost like the short socks that are popular now. (304)</p>

<h3>On Poetry</h3>
<p>— Qu Yi</p>
<p>Reading Mr. Jiang Jiping's article on poetry reminded me of an incident from my middle school days.</p>
<p>At that time, our history teacher was Mr. Hong Foshi from Cixi. It was said that Mr. Hong was an experienced hand in the poetry world. A classmate asked him about the method of writing poetry. The short and fat Mr. Hong, upon hearing this, lifted the sweat towel tied to the long robe around his hips and navel, giggled, shook his head, and said:</p>
<p>"Poetry—poetry is something you don't necessarily need to learn. Poetry has a separate heart, it's not related to learning. The ancients also said so. Because poetry has a poetic realm. The poetic realm is not something you can learn. It all depends on individual talent and spirituality.</p>
<p>"For example, in Tang poetry, there is the line: 'Ascending the mountain, I asked a boy, He said the master had gone to gather herbs. He is in this mountain, But the clouds are deep and I don't know where.' That poem has its own complete realm. This realm cannot be explained. Once you explain it, it feels tasteless. But now, if we common people were to use that tune and write a poem saying: 'I asked the gatekeeper, He said the teacher had gone to class. He is in this city, But there are many schools and I don't know where.' It wouldn't be poetry." "Or, like the Tang poem, 'On the Twenty-Four Bridges, on a moonlit night, Where does the jade beauty teach the flute?' If you change it to 'On the bank of Lu Dian Bridge on a moonlit night (because our school is near that bridge), Where do students play the piano?' It wouldn't be poetry…"</p>
<p>After saying this, Mr. Hong naturally let out a few more chuckles. But this humorous remark left a very deep impression on me. Because I was desperately reading Du Fu's poems at that time, I always felt that Mr. Hong's words were not entirely true. After carefully studying the main idea of Mr. Hong's words, it was that all realistic materials are not allowed in poetry. The so-called poetic realm lies in the realm of emptiness and etherealness, and in the imagination of dreams. Otherwise, the poetic realm will feel solemn. To put it more clearly, poetry needs a greater amount of imagination. What Mr. Jiang Jiping calls "daydreaming" is another name for the function of imagination. However, Mr. Jiang pays more attention to "daydreaming" in terms of technique.</p>
<p>This kind of traditional understanding of poetry certainly still exists in the hearts of many poets. Modernist poetry—the so-called Impressionist poetry—although it somewhat embellishes itself with the sensual words of modern cities, still retains this traditional sentiment in its techniques and realm. The so-called "daydreaming" in the realm, the "unconventionality" in technique. The fact that Impressionist poetry can become popular in China can be found in the historical and social basis here.</p>
<p>But according to my personal experience, when I read these "daydreaming" poems, I can certainly get a little joy. However, the impression is not very deep. On the contrary, there is a kind of poem that, when you first read it, you don't think it's a poem, but when you close the book, all kinds of impressions in the poem rush to your mind. Sometimes, you can even see the reality of this poem in real society. It makes people exclaim involuntarily, "How can there really be such a thing!" The best example is Du Fu's "Northern Expedition."</p>
<p>The beginning of "Northern Expedition" is: "The emperor's second year of reign, Autumn, the intercalary eighth month, auspicious day, Du Fu is about to embark on a northern expedition,茫茫asked about his family." These plain and straightforward sentences are certainly not poetic. But the more it is written later, the more powerful it becomes. "Moreover, I fell into the dust of the Hu, and when I return, my hair will be gray; After a year to the thatched hut, my wife and children are in rags: The sound of wailing echoes through the pines, and the sad spring is choked with sobs. The most beloved child in my life, his face is whiter than snow: Seeing his father's back, he cries, his feet are dirty and without socks; Two little daughters in front of the bed, mending patches that barely cover their knees. The sea map is folded with waves, the old embroidery is shifted with twists and turns, 天吴and紫凤, are upside down in the short hemp." This is such a vivid and realistic picture. But there is no daydreaming here, and no ethereal thoughts. But the impression given to the reader is deeper than any poem. This is because the author does not want to manipulate words and play those clever tricks to dazzle your eyes, but is willing to honestly tell you a few heartfelt words.</p>
<p>Therefore, in my opinion, poetry does not necessarily have to have any poetic meaning or anything like that, the main thing is still truth, just like other literature. However, in its expression techniques, it must use the most concise and powerful form to summarize the high point of the phenomenon. Add a musical tone. Several of Sha Ting's novels can be said to be prose poems in essence. After reading his novels, we can imagine which direction new poetry should go in the future. But first, we must break the general public's traditional view of poetry.</p>
<h3>Snippets</h3>
<p>— Wo Pu</p>
<p>Postscript to "Pale Sky, Idle Clouds"</p>
<p>The aforementioned "Pale Sky, Idle Clouds" cited the "Yang Guifei Dancing with the Jade Plate Suite" from Volume Six of the Yongxi Yuefu, thinking that it came from Wang Bocheng's "Zhu Gong Diao of the Legacy of the Tianbao Era," but now I know that it is not the case. The suite is actually the second act of Bai Renfu's "Tang Minghuang and Autumn Night Wu Tong Yu Zaju," and it is correct that the Song, Jin, and Yuan Zhu Gong Diao studies did not include it. At the time, because of the name "Yang Guifei Dancing with the Jade Plate" in Yongxi Yuefu, I did not suspect that it came from a Zaju; moreover, the "Yuanqu Xuan" was not on hand, which led to the error. Therefore, some of the inferences in the previous article are wrong and need to be corrected.</p>
<p>Doing the work of collecting lost works from the Tianbao Legacy from the Yongxi Yuefu and books of the song score type is indeed not easy in terms of discernment. In Yuanqu, Bai Renfu also has a "Tang Minghuang's Visit to the Moon Palace," Guan Hanqing has a "Tang Minghuang's Crying over the Fragrant Pouch," Yu Tianxi has a "Yang Taizhen's Lament of the Neon Clothes," and "Yang Taizhen's Huaqing Palace" in two versions are the same subject matter; perhaps each book has included them, but most of them are not clearly marked, and it is extremely easy to confuse them. Therefore, it is inevitable that there will still be situations of "substituting plums for peaches" in the ones that have been collected now.</p>
<p>Comparing the second act of "Wu Tong Yu" with the "Yang Guifei Dancing with the Jade Plate Suite" in Yongxi, Yongxi actually lacks the two songs "Mantingfang" and "Putianle" after "Manqingcai." Moreover, there are many differences in the words, probably dozens of words in these ten branch tunes. If each word is compared individually, it seems too cumbersome. The Yongxi era was before the "Yuanqu Xuan," and we naturally say that Yongxi is closer to the true image of the Yuan people. Thus, we see the means and evidence of Zang Jinshu's transformation and polishing here. In general, the deleted words and errors in Yongxi have been corrected, and the two added songs also added a lot to the sentiment and checkpoints. For example, in the "Pecking Woodpecker's Tail Sound," Yongxi's "How many times did the children endure Yanmen Pass" does not conform to the tone of entering Shu. The "Yuanqu Xuan" changed it to "How many times did the children endure Jianmen Pass," which is very appropriate. This can be regarded as turning iron into gold. The "Pink Butterfly" tune in Wutong Yu reads:</p>
<p>"The sky is pale and the clouds are idle, and there are several lines of migrating geese in the long sky. The summer scenery in the imperial garden is beginning to fade, the willows add yellow, the lotus reduces green, and the autumn lotus stocks are petal-like. Sitting near the secluded railing, spraying the fragrance of jade hairpin flowers blooming."</p>
<p>This has a few more words than the Yongxi version and is more similar to the "Surprise Change" tune in the Palace of Eternal Life. Hong Sheng honestly inherited something from "Wu Tong Yu" (however, Li Linfu replaced Yang Guozhong) and has nothing to do with Wang Bocheng's "Legacy of the Tianbao Era." Did he see the Legacy of the Tianbao Era? I dare not say. But in the preface to "The Palace of Eternal Life," he begins by saying:</p>
<p>"I have read Bai Letian's "Song of Everlasting Regret" and the Yuan Dynasty people's "Autumn Rain Wu Tong Drama," and I have felt disgusted for several days!"</p>
<p>He seems to be quite disdainful of "Wu Tong Yu," which is really embarrassing for him and can't help but make people feel a little chilly.</p>
<h3>Broken Floss</h3>
<p>— Ouyang Fanhai</p>
<p>At the edge of the sea, at the corner of the earth,</p>
<p>comforting my loneliness, sharing the wind and frost with me,</p>
<p>only this loyal cotton wadding,</p>
<p>now it is broken! like a bitter mouth begging for a split wound:</p>
<p>Look at how many wrinkles have been added to your own face,</p>
<p>I don't have the function of metabolism,</p>
<p>how can I withstand endless torment?</p>
<p>I comforted it and said:</p>
<p>Share a few more years of hardship with me!</p>
<p>I will personally repair the wounds for you,</p>
<p>Fortunately, the homeless vagabond has long been accustomed to mending and patching!</p>
<p>I found the few hemp threads</p>
<p>that my mother put in my luggage, shedding tears</p>
<p>Her instructions are still in my ears:</p>
<p>It's good to be at home for a thousand days, but it's hard to go out for a moment,</p>
<p>From now on, you have to be careful with sewing and cutting yourself,</p>
<p>Once you've used up these hemp threads, you should plan to return to your hometown soon!</p>
<p>How many years has it been? Countless sunsets, countless mornings!</p>
<p>——4.10.1935——</p>
<h3>Mr. Kapitan (Part Two)</h3>
<p>— Hei Ying</p>
<p>Mr. Kapitan nodded without saying a word. I poured him a cup of tea. While smoking, he never said a word to me. Nor did he ask when the boss would be back. After a while, he left without saying goodbye. He left the shop and quickly disappeared into the darkness on the street.</p>
<p>For some reason, the pockmarked landlady came down from upstairs in a very happy mood, as if she had just taken a cold shower and applied a lot of talcum powder to her neck. She sat down next to me and asked:</p>
<p>"Who was that who just came?"</p>
<p>"Mr. Kapitan." I replied, looking at her.</p>
<p>"Why do you always call him Mr. Kapitan! He's not a Kapitan anymore." she began to say to me, "Five years ago, you could call him Kapitan. At that time, his shop was very prosperous, and he made a fortune because of his coconut kernel business, so the Dutch looked up to him very much and tried their best to ingratiate themselves with him. One year, the old Kapitan named Zheng happened to die, and his son was young and did not live up to expectations. The government immediately put the Kapitan's hat on the head of this coconut kernel merchant."</p>
<p>"What happened later? How was this Xiamen man's hat snatched away again?" I asked urgently.</p>
<p>"Isn't that the principle of 'people eating people'? Although this Xiamen man is very kind, after he became Kapitan, he was really as good as could be to the Tang people on the wharf, but do you know why the Dutch want a Kapitan? Would he let the Kapitan help the Tang people without doing anything for the government? That man named Zheng's son took this opportunity to become active, flattering the Dutch. At the same time, last year the price of coconut kernels suffered an unprecedented slump, and Mr. Kapitan's business plummeted, leaving him with no way to avoid being spurned by the Dutch."</p>
<p>"So, he's no longer any kind of Mr. Kapitan." the landlady concluded.</p>
<p>I hugged my knees with both hands and sat there silently, thinking of my father's words again. Yes, sometimes people in this world eat people! That Mr. Kapitan eating this Mr. Kapitan is a very good proof. I also thought of that Mr. Kapitan who was eaten, so thin and never having a smile on his face, always coming to the shop once every day, the pain hidden in his heart was really deep…</p>
<p>It wasn't until the boss came back that it was time to close the shop. I was awakened by the scolding, "Are you dazed? Why haven't you closed the door yet!" I started to move the door panels out one by one, and then installed them one by one.</p>
<h3>Abandonment</h3>
<p>— Qian Dong</p>
<p>The child was especially playful today, and started babbling as soon as he woke up.</p>
<p>"Smile!" said my wife.</p>
<p>The child did smile, pouting his lips and laughing.</p>
<p>My wife was also amused and shouted triumphantly, "One more! One more!"</p>
<p>Immediately, my wife's face darkened, and she said to me in a low voice, "Don't abandon him, Xiao Bo. The child is becoming more and more playful every day. Let's suffer a little ourselves!"</p>
<p>"Isn't that what I'm thinking too—" I hated my wife's love of talking empty talk, so my voice was a little angry.</p>
<p>My wife, with tears streaming down her face, hugged the child even tighter and screamed sobbingly, "I won't! I won't! I'll beg for food to raise him!"</p>
<p>The child was still babbling his own words. The wind outside the window roared wildly. I remained silent.</p>
<p>Silence, the room was dominated by an atmosphere of silence.</p>
<p>It was almost noon. My wife tremblingly handed the child to me, and tears fell from her face in a rustling stream. I understood her meaning, so I took the child. The child, upon touching my hands, started laughing again.</p>
<p>Along the way, I paid attention to the child's movements from time to time. I don't know why, but the child was especially playful today. Sometimes he even flattered me, as if he already knew his future. His two little eyes were always staring at me suspiciously, perhaps he was blaming me!</p>
<p>When I arrived at the nursery, my heart suddenly jumped again. The doorkeeper called out a girl wearing glasses. She smiled and asked me to enter the reception room, carefully took the child over. She asked kindly, "Why are you bringing the child here?"</p>
<p>"Because I can't afford to raise him!" I said these words and felt very cold.</p>
<p>"Then will you regret it later?"</p>
<p>"No!" I replied straightforwardly.</p>
<p>I left. The girl nodded to me. My child turned his head and stared at me with sharp eyes. The flying sand on the road was also hitting me fiercely. I was squeezed and couldn't breathe.</p>
<p>As soon as I pushed open the door, my wife quickly jumped up, her eyes like electric torches searching me, she stared at me intently, front and back. Front and back, there was nothing, only me, me alone!</p>
<p>She seemed to be crazy, her pale face was stretched tight, her teeth were chattering, and tears rolled down like a rainstorm.</p>
<p>I walked into the room silently. At this time, my wife had already burst into sobs, she was preparing for a long cry. I stared blankly at the clouds in the sky, the clouds were flying erratically; I also vaguely heard the wind hitting the windows, making a sound, the wind was laughing hoarsely.</p>
<h3>End of the Alley</h3>
<h3>Three Days (1)</h3>
<p>— Luo Hong</p>
<p>The weather seemed to be playing a joke, only giving us half a day of sunshine before turning gloomy again. Gradually, the gloom deepened, and thin streaks of rain began to fall from the sky. People sighed, fearing they might be sinning, and swallowed their complaints about the weather, replacing them with "Amitabha."</p>
<p>"Amitabha! It looks like the heavens want to wipe out us poor people!" everyone said.</p>
<p>A dark shadow arose in their hearts, flickering with the tragic image of being wiped out by the heavens. But despite these words, everyone was afraid and unwilling to dwell on the thought, because everyone wanted to live and hoped that the heavens would show some mercy and give them a few days of sunshine.</p>
<p>If this continued for another ten days or so, the rice in the fields could not be harvested and would sprout, rendering it useless. This summer, the fields desperately needed water, but were dry for over two months. People had to draw water day and night, nearly exhausting themselves to death. Having struggled so hard to get through it, the rice plants had not dried up into hay, and had formed ears as long as foxtails. Just as everyone was celebrating that they wouldn't have to flee and become refugees, the heavens began to rain continuously, ruining the autumn harvest again.</p>
<p>"The heavens are really... it's raining again!" Youfa said, seeing his younger brother walking through the rain from the east, his voice sounding like he intentionally wanted his brother to hear. But his brother, carrying a sickle and moving his calves bulging with veins, went straight into the house. Youfa also busied himself tidying up the burlap sack he was mending, and dashed into the house, covered in water droplets. Standing at the doorway, he shook his body, and slapped his shoulders with his hands alternately, sending water droplets flying in all directions. His brother, however, stretched his neck and took a long gulp from the mouth of the Zisha teapot, his Adam's apple moving up and down, making gurgling sounds for a long time. Then he put the teapot on the table and wiped his wet hair with both hands.</p>
<p>Youfa glanced at his brother a few times, wanting to say something, opened his mouth for a while, and then looked outside again. The sky outside was gloomy, and the leaden-colored dark clouds seemed to be pressing down on the ground along with the rain streaks. He touched the large clump of hair, about three inches long, on his chin, dragged a stool to the doorway, and sat down, saying,</p>
<p>"Youcai, what do you say, will you agree or not?!"</p>
<p>"I've told you before, I don't agree," the younger brother said, wiping the water from his hair and then wiping his hands on his black cloth jacket.</p>
<p>"I'm saying, just agree to it. Your wife will be a nanny at Master Lu's house, and she certainly won't suffer any losses. Besides, there will be one less mouth to feed at home, and she will bring in wages every month. What's not to like about that!" Youfa looked at his brother anxiously and timidly, and then looked at the rain streaks outside. He himself couldn't remember how many times he had said this.</p>

<h3>The Effectiveness of Telegrams in Disaster Relief</h3>
<p>— Zhen</p>
<p>—Acknowledgment of Appreciation from the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee—</p>
<p>The Yellow River has been a source of disaster since ancient times, and is even more severe today. Every time the season for floods arrives, if preventive measures are not taken in advance, once the river dyke breaks, it will flood for miles, and the loss of life and property will be incalculable. The way to provide relief is to emphasize both short-term and long-term solutions, and rapid communication is especially urgent, because rivers are very fast-flowing and there are many flood prevention agencies. If they do not rely on the convenience of communication, they will certainly fail.</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications has always paid attention to Yellow River water management. It has stipulated telegram numbers for reporting water levels and flow rates, and it was also heard that in July of last year, it issued a notice to the telegraph bureaus in Jinan, Kaifeng, Xi'an, and other places, stating that if the Yellow River Conservancy Commission sends out telegrams about flooding, they should be sent free of charge immediately. In addition, during the major flood season, the rivers often swell at night. These telegrams are of utmost importance, and if various flood reporting stations send telegrams at night, they must be sent out immediately. The receiving bureaus should send them as soon as they receive them, and if necessary, the working hours of the bureaus can be extended.</p>
<p>As for the order of transmission of disaster relief telegrams, they are normally listed after ordinary telegrams. However, this time, the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee was in charge of the Guantai breaching closure and repair project, and the telegrams sent by the committee were regarded as matters of disaster relief and could not be ignored. Therefore, all telegraph bureaus were able to send them in the shortest time possible using the most agile methods. As a result, the committee received news very quickly and was able to quickly achieve great success, eliminating the disaster invisibly. It has been learned that the Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee sent a telegram to Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications, praising the various telegraph bureaus for their efforts in assisting the project regardless of their respective jurisdictions. The telegram is copied below, which shows the effectiveness of telegrams to some extent.</p>
<p>"Minister Zhu of the Ministry of Communications, Nanjing: The engineering relief group of this committee was in charge of the Guantai breaching closure and repair project, which was successfully completed on the 11th of this month. The urgency of this project and the critical timing relied on the assistance of your ministry's telegraph stations, regardless of their respective jurisdictions, to transmit messages and exchange telegrams. This made it possible to quickly complete the project in a short period of time, saving the disaster victims from being plunged into catastrophe. We deeply admire your dedication to public service. We hereby send this telegram to express our gratitude and hope that you will take note. Yellow River Disaster Relief Committee, respectfully, Hao."</p>
<h3>Improving Telephone Billing Methods</h3>
<p>— Qinghua</p>
<p>The telephone bureaus of the Ministry of Communications have always charged users for telephone calls on their own, without a unified method. As a result, although each telephone bureau uses twenty or thirty bill collectors to collect fees from users, the results are still not good, and arrears accumulate. Although the reason for this is that users do not fulfill their obligations to pay according to regulations, the lack of a fixed billing date and method is also an important reason. In order to effectively rectify billing and make it easier for users to pay, the Ministry of Communications has newly formulated a "Method for Telephone Bureaus to Charge Users," the main points of which are as follows:</p>
<p>(1) The telephone bureau shall, according to local conditions, divide the locality into several districts and stipulate a date from the first to the tenth day of each month as the date for collecting fees from users in a certain district. The boundaries of these districts and the names of the streets within the districts shall be published in the newspaper by the telephone bureau and printed in the telephone directory.</p>
<p>(2) On each billing date, the telephone bureau shall send a bill collector wearing a badge, holding a formal receipt from the telephone bureau that has been filled out in advance and stamped with the bureau's seal, to collect fees from users. If the user pays immediately, the bill collector shall stamp the receipt with his or her personal seal and hand it to the user. If the user cannot pay on the same day due to being out or other reasons, the bill collector shall leave a "Payment Reminder Notice." This notice is divided into three parts: one part is the payment reminder notice, one part is the temporary receipt, and one part is the payment notice. After receiving this three-part form, the user shall take the form to the telephone bureau or the nearest telegraph office (which is attached to each post office) within five days to pay the fee. The receiving person shall stamp the temporary receipt and hand it to the user, and the remaining two parts shall be left at the bureau or office.</p>
<p>(3) After the telephone bureau receives the user's payment or the payment notice from the telegraph office, it shall immediately deliver or mail the formal receipt to the user. If the user has not received the formal receipt mailed by the telephone bureau within seven days after paying at the telegraph office, or if the telephone bureau calls to urge payment, the user can notify the telephone bureau by telephone for investigation.</p>
<p>(4) If the user still fails to pay within five days after receiving the payment reminder notice from the bill collector, the telephone bureau shall call the user once on the third day after the expiration date to urge payment. If the user still fails to pay the fee to the bureau or office on the same day, the telephone bureau shall suspend the call on the fifth day after the expiration date. If the user still fails to pay within seven days after the suspension of the call, the number shall be canceled and the machine dismantled, and the unpaid telephone monthly rental fee and long-distance call fee shall be deducted from the deposit fee. The above method is based on the method used by the Capital Electric Power Plant to collect electricity fees, and it is now scheduled to be implemented on May 1.</p>
<p>There are four benefits after implementation: (1) Users have a fixed date for collecting telephone fees and can prepare on time; (2) If users cannot pay the telephone fee to the bill collector on the same day, they can pay it to the nearest telegraph office within five days, without having to go to the telephone bureau, saving the trouble of traveling; (3) The telephone bureau can collect fees on time without having to send bill collectors to urge users to pay again and again, saving manpower; (4) The telephone bureau can solve the problem of unpaid telephone fees, ensure revenue, and further improve and develop its business. These four benefits are divided equally between users and telephones, so the implementation of this method can be said to be a win-win situation!</p>
<p>Finally, the reporter hopes that all users will fulfill their monthly obligations, that is, to pay the monthly rental fee on time, in order to reduce the telephone bureau's payment urging procedures. At a time when the telephone bureau is striving to serve the public (such as adding information desks), users should enjoy various rights as much as possible, and hope to pay the small monthly telephone rental fee on time in a spirit of cooperation, and not delay payment. On the one hand, this is to show the spirit of rewarding the telephone bureau for its service, and at the same time, it is to protect their own rights!</p>
<h3>The Prohibition of Illegal Collection of Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Kaidi</p>
<p>According to the Telecommunications Regulations, the telegraph business cannot be operated privately by any organization or individual other than those commissioned or specially approved by the Ministry of Communications. In recent years, due to the development of radio, a few elements in society have often secretly set up radio stations to secretly send and receive telegrams, pursuing personal interests and harming state-owned enterprises. They really have no regard for the law! After the Ministry of Communications severely cracked down on this, this trend dared to be curbed slightly. For example, the Yongli and Yongzeng Silver Houses in Tianjin secretly set up radio stations, which have been cracked down on and dealt with according to law, and this publication has reported on them in detail. Unexpectedly, during the period of cracking down on secretly set up radio stations, another case of illegally collecting telegrams was discovered in Xiamen. This not only harmed telegraph revenue, but also had a very negative impact on overseas Chinese from southern China! Now, the whole story of this case is announced, so that ordinary unscrupulous merchants can be warned, and overseas Chinese should not be fooled by them.</p>
<p>It has been found that in Xiamen, a very large number of Chinese overseas Chinese go abroad to the South Sea Islands every month, but because Manila handles the entry procedures for foreigners very carefully, there is a danger of being refused entry and sent back home if there is any non-compliance. Therefore, before going abroad, overseas Chinese must not only entrust the passport office to handle passports and various travel agencies to handle ship tickets, but also send telegrams to relatives and friends in Manila to handle the guarantee and reception procedures for landing. In order to facilitate the communication of overseas Chinese going abroad, the Ministry of Communications has specially opened a Xiamen-Philippines radio circuit in Xiamen to directly report to Manila, which is fast and accurate, and overseas Chinese send many telegrams every month, which is very convenient. These telegrams notifying relatives and friends are either entrusted to the passport office or travel agency by the overseas Chinese for sending, or sent to the Xiamen Radio Station by the overseas Chinese themselves for sending. However, it has been found that in the past three or four months, although overseas Chinese have still been going abroad continuously, these telegrams have suddenly decreased month by month. After many investigations and studies by the Xiamen Radio Station, it was discovered that the employees of the China-Philippines Cooperative Society and the Taikoo Dianji Company had the whimsical idea of using the International Night Letter Telegram Rules promulgated by the Ministry of Communications to solicit such telegrams from overseas Chinese in various travel agencies, charging each person a telegraph fee of three or five yuan or more, and then combining the collected telegrams into one telegram, making up more than twenty-five characters (because the night letter telegram stipulates that each telegram should have a minimum limit of twenty-five characters), and sending it to the Xiamen Radio Station as a night letter telegram for profit. Now, the disadvantages of this kind of soliciting telegrams for overseas Chinese going abroad are described as follows:</p>
<p>The prices for telegrams sent from Xiamen to Manila can be divided into three types: ordinary telegrams are 1.5 yuan per word, delayed telegrams are 0.75 yuan per word, and night letter telegrams are 0.5 yuan per word. Most of the telegrams sent by overseas Chinese to notify relatives and friends to handle entry and landing procedures are sent as delayed telegrams. Each telegram is calculated on average with six characters, and the telegraph fee is only 4.5 yuan, while the telegrams illegally solicited by the China-Philippines Cooperative Society and the Taikoo Dianji Company charge 4 or 5 yuan per person, which is a limited amount of telegraph fee saved for the overseas Chinese, but the telegraph revenue suffers a great loss. This kind of illegally solicited mixed night letter telegram is sent by each society to a pre-arranged person in Manila, who then separately informs the passport office or the relatives and friends of the overseas Chinese to handle the guarantee and reception procedures when the ship arrives at the port. Such roundabout notification is very easy to cause various errors and dangers, so overseas Chinese often arrive at the other shore and are often refused entry and sent back home because the night letter telegrams are delivered too late (night letter telegrams are specially cheap, and the delivery time is stipulated to be delayed for 24 hours or more), or the other party's notification is not perfect, and no one is guaranteed to receive them. I advise you overseas Chinese that if you want to send this kind of telegram in the future, please go directly to the Xiamen Telegraph Bureau or Radio Station to send it, which is fast and accurate and will never fail!</p>
<p>The Ministry of Communications, in view of the fact that this kind of illegally solicited telegrams not only harms the reputation of the telegraph bureau and affects business revenue, but also has a great relationship with the overseas Chinese policy, has now ordered the Xiamen Telegraph Bureau and Radio Station to severely crack down on this. On the one hand, it has formally warned each society to immediately stop this illegal act of privately soliciting telegrams, and on the other hand, it has ordered the Xiamen Bureau and Taiwan to charge all mixed telegrams with unclear meanings according to the number of words, in order to prevent taking advantage of the loopholes. Otherwise, they will refuse to receive them. On the other hand, it will also send a letter to the Xiamen Overseas Chinese Association to inform all overseas Chinese going abroad to pay attention and not to be fooled by each society again. I think that after such a severe crackdown, the lawless people can disappear from now on!</p>
<h3>Talking about Ship Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Zhongming</p>
<p>—Connecting Water and Land Communication, Ensuring Navigation Safety—</p>
<p>Before the invention of wireless telegraphy, it was impossible for people living on land to communicate with ships sailing in the ocean. However, since the success of wireless communication technology, this matter has not only become possible, but also developed very widely and rapidly. Now, almost all larger tonnage ships are equipped with paperless radio transmitting and receiving machines, so that they can communicate with the land when sailing. This equipment not only solves the communication problem between water and land, but also adds a very good guarantee to navigation safety. It not only solves the ship's own communication problems, but also provides convenience for passengers seeking communication. Therefore, passengers on the voyage who want to communicate with relatives and friends on land, or relatives and friends on land who want to communicate with passengers on the voyage, or business travelers who want to report their itinerary or what they have seen and heard to their government agencies during the voyage, or government agencies that have urgent official business that must be communicated with business travelers who are on the voyage, can all use ship wireless telegraphy. Even though they are far away across the ocean and the ship's whereabouts are uncertain, as long as they are equipped with wireless equipment, they can communicate at any time, and there is no suffering of "drifting"! As for the "guarantee of navigation safety," there are two aspects to it. One is that when ships encounter dangers such as fire, reefs, typhoons, and bandits during the voyage, they can send telegrams for help, and they can also contact the terrestrial observatory to receive weather alerts through wireless electricity at any time and prepare in advance. The second is to report the itinerary and assist in public security. Reporting the itinerary is the main task of the ship radio station. Assisting in public security is also a method of using ship telegrams. For example, if the terrestrial public security organs fail to capture criminals and believe that they have taken a ship to escape export, they can send a ship telegram to the owner of a certain ship, explaining the appearance, age, accent, etc., and ask them to pay attention to the inspection. After receiving this telegram, the ship owner can secretly monitor those who have this suspicion and hand them over to the local public security organs or the court when they arrive at the shore. From this point of view, ship wireless telegrams are indeed a very important and very convenient tool for water and land communication. The Ministry of Communications has special regulations for the charging method of ship wireless telegrams, which shows the authorities' attention to ship telegrams.</p>
<p>Due to the special nature of the business and the increased complexity of communication procedures, the telegraph fee for ship wireless telegrams is different from that of terrestrial communication, and the applicable special business is also limited. Ship reports are divided into domestic and international. Domestic ones are charged in national currency. Each Chinese plain language word is 25 cents of silver, each Chinese code word or foreign language word is 50 cents of silver, and foreign language code word telegrams are charged at full price, and the reduced charging method for international code word telegrams is not applicable. The writing method of the name, title, ship name, coastal station name or address of all addressees is the same as that of ordinary telegrams, but they must be charged according to the number of words, and the regulations that the place name of the receiving place and the name and address of the addressee within 15 characters are calculated as five characters are not applicable. For example:</p>
<p>(1) Ding Zihong, Official Ship No. 20, Xinming, Yantai</p>
<p>(2) Captain Wangshihlee SS Haiyuan Tsiagtanradio</p>
<p>The first example should be calculated as twelve characters, and the second example should be calculated as five characters. As for international ship telegrams, due to the complexity of the routing channels, they are divided into eleven categories of charges, all calculated in francs, and the telegraph fee per word ranges from 90 centimes to 2 francs 15 centimes. The detailed method is that the Ministry of Communications has a table of prices for international ship telegrams, which can be requested for reading. Speaking of the difference between domestic and international ship telegrams, Articles 3 and 11 of the Ship Wireless Telegraph Charging Rules promulgated by the Ministry of Communications have the following provisions:</p>
<p>"Article 3: Telegrams sent to and from various places in the country by ships that have been registered by the Ministry of Communications and issued with ship wireless station licenses, and transmitted through the coastal radio stations under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Communications, are domestic ship telegrams. Ship telegrams that do not comply with the provisions of the preceding paragraph are international ship telegrams."</p>
<p>"Article 11: Ships stipulated in Paragraph 1 of Article 3 of these Rules, which want to apply the regulations of domestic ship telegram prices for telegrams sent to and from various places in the country, should submit an application to the Ministry of Communications for approval and record through their supervising organs, and then notify the coastal radio stations and telegraph bureaus by the Ministry of Communications to be effective." The special business applicable to ship telegrams is limited to the following six types:</p>
<p>(A) Prepaid reply fee (B) Proofreading (C) Distribution (D) Notification of proper delivery (Only the coastal radio station will notify the original sender of the date and time of the telegram's transmission to the ship radio station) (E) Special delivery (Only applicable to telegrams sent from ships to land) (F) Fee-paying official telegrams</p>
<p>The additional fees for the aforementioned special businesses, such as domestic ship telegrams, are charged according to the domestic telegram regulations, and international ship telegrams are charged according to the international telegram regulations. As for the method of sharing telegraph fees between the ship radio station and the forwarding agency, there are also clear regulations in the appendix to the said rules, which are omitted.</p>
<p>The above method was recently formulated and promulgated by the Ministry of Communications. Previously, all ship telegrams were charged according to international prices, and there was no distinction between domestic and international. In view of the fact that the burden on the people was too heavy with this method, the Ministry of Communications added domestic ship telegrams, and the telegraph fees were much lighter than before. The development of ship telegraph business can be controlled from now on.</p>
<p>In view of the importance of ship radio stations, and at the same time admiring the enthusiasm of the Ministry of Communications in rectifying ship telegraph charges, the reporter cannot help but have twelve points of hope; hoping that ships sailing in our country's territory—whether state-run or private—will install radio stations as much as possible in order to ensure navigation safety. At the same time, according to the provisions of the Ship Telegraph Charging Rules, they should apply to the Ministry of Communications for registration and license in order to seek communication convenience.</p>
<h3>All Kinds of Social Telegrams</h3>
<p>— Reporter</p>
<p>(1) Copying Fees for Social Telegrams: The number of copies calculated for domestic distribution telegrams is calculated according to the number of names and addresses of all addressees. Each copy is charged 20 cents of silver for 50 characters or less, and added accordingly if it exceeds this. Those that do not meet this standard are also calculated as 50 characters. This method has been implemented since March 1 of this year. The copying fee for social telegrams has been changed to one cent of silver per copy of 50 characters since December of last year. Those that do not meet 50 characters are also calculated as 50 characters, and added accordingly if it exceeds this. This is earlier than the implementation of price reduction for ordinary telegrams.</p>
<p>(2) Mailing of Social Telegrams: The main priority of ordinary telegrams is to deliver them quickly, so telegrams sent to villages and towns that do not have telegraph bureaus are usually charged a special fee for special delivery. However, the time sensitivity of social telegrams is relatively broad. There is no need for special delivery. It is enough for the receiving bureau to transfer the telegram to the post office for delivery according to the telegraph regulations. The sender and receiver do not have to pay a special fee, and social telegrams can reach the countryside.</p>
<p>(3) Counting Characters in Social Telegrams: Although the name and address of the addressee of a social telegram can be applied to the new chapter on saving fees, according to the rules for social telegrams, each telegram must have a minimum of 20 characters. Therefore, for social telegrams whose number of characters is calculated according to the new chapter on saving fees, if the number of characters does not meet the minimum, the number of characters should be calculated according to the minimum number of characters. The number of characters charged listed in the bottom character number column of the telegram should also list the minimum number of characters. For example, for a 25-character social telegram, if the address is calculated according to the new chapter on saving fees, the entire telegram is only 18 characters, but it should be charged according to 20 characters according to the rules, so the number of characters charged and the actual number of characters listed in the bottom character number column of the telegram should be 20 and 25 characters.</p>
<p>(4) Scope of Social Telegrams: The Ministry of Communications created social telegrams in order to promote business and arouse the interest of the Chinese people in sending telegrams, so the prices are particularly low, and the telegraph bureau does not care about the loss of labor and materials. The scope of this telegram has been expanded from April 1 as follows: (1) Matters related to celebrating New Year's Day, weddings, additions of children, birthdays, anniversaries, graduations, going abroad, openings, relocations, passing exams, promotions, job postings, inventions, seeking merit, victory, ceremonies, and awards; (2) Matters related to condolences, deaths, and funerals; (3) Matters related to condolences, illnesses, disasters, carelessness, injuries, theft, and failures; and (4) Telegrams expressing welcome or farewell, and replies in response, shall be listed as social telegrams. Social telegrams are actually the most widely used for social interactions among people. However, because the purpose is broad, the telegrams written by senders often have unclear meanings that do not meet the regulations, which is contrary to the original intention of creating social telegrams. It is heard that the Ministry of Communications has ordered the personnel of each telegraph bureau to pay close attention, and that if the telegrams of social telegrams do not meet the regulations in the future, they should gently advise the sender to change the numbers and sentences before receiving them.</p>
<h3>International Radio Telegraph, Telex, and Telephone Operations Overview</h3>
<p>— Shen Yuanhong</p>
<p>Upon investigation, the Ministry of Communications has been improving telegraph efficiency daily. The telex machines mentioned by Mr. Shen have already been installed in major bureaus in Beijing, Tianjin, Shanghai, Wuhan, Ping, and Qing. Furthermore, all bureaus have long implemented telephone telegraph services, not just the international radio station. However, the staff at the international radio station are highly dedicated. All facilities are satisfactory, deserving of national praise. Mr. Shen's article is indeed a true account. Editor's Note</p>
<p>In recent times, with the flourishing of science and the increasing complexity of affairs, the telegraph industry has become increasingly developed, progressing from wired to wireless communication, and from domestic to international transmissions. Thus, even across vast oceans and thousands of miles, messages can be exchanged within moments, as if face-to-face, thanks to the power of wireless technology. However, even with such speed in telegraph communication, if delivery is not equally prompt, the effort is wasted. Recognizing this, the International Radio Station, to further develop its business, has not only hired efficient delivery personnel to improve delivery efficiency but has also established dedicated telephone and telex billing rooms, staffed day and night by specially selected, experienced, and courteous personnel. Businesses with heavy telegraph traffic seeking faster delivery can request special arrangements to have their messages transmitted by telephone or telex. The operations of telephone and telex transmissions are detailed below:</p>
<p>(1) Telephone Transmission: Businesses first apply for special arrangements, providing their name, address, registered name, etc., in a prescribed format, and setting a secret code, often using names of plants or animals, such as "banana" and "phoenix" in Chinese, or "Sweet Banana Beautiful Phoenix" in English, to prevent impersonation. When sending a telegram, the business can call the International Radio Station. The telephone operator then directly connects to the telex room. A telephone transmission operator answers, and the sender provides their name, secret code, recipient's name, address, and the message. The station's telephone operator repeats the message for confirmation, ensuring accuracy. Once confirmed, the message is assigned a number and transmitted. Conversely, when a telegram arrives from abroad, the station's telephone operator immediately relays the message to the recipient by telephone, who then repeats it for verification. This process typically takes no more than three minutes, proving highly convenient.</p>
<p>(2) Telex Transmission: While telephone transmission is much faster than manual delivery, certain special agencies, such as foreign exchange dealers, specialized financial institutions, and news organizations, require even faster, more accurate, and simpler methods, thus leading to the use of telex machines. A telex machine is a device that, when powered, uses direct lines to connect to the sender. It resembles a typewriter in form, but its internal structure is quite different, and its letter keys are more widely spaced. When typing, pressing a key causes the machine to hum, and the corresponding text appears on the recipient's machine. Conversely, typing on the recipient's machine also displays the text on the sender's machine. This facilitates dialogue, message transmission, and news reporting with unparalleled convenience. Typically, a telegram can be completed in one or two minutes. There is also a "WhoAreYou" call key, which, when pressed, displays the machine's number. The other party can then respond by pressing the same key, displaying their machine number on the sender's machine. This confirms that someone is responding, allowing the sender to transmit the message. Currently, the International Radio Station has six such machines connected to eight businesses and is equipped with a central switching hub, allowing any machine to connect to any other, resulting in significant economic savings. Reuters alone sends and receives seventy to eighty telegrams daily. The future development of this telex service is truly unlimited.</p>
<p>The above two methods of telegraph delivery represent the International Radio Station's contribution to society, and we sincerely hope that all sectors will make good use of them!</p>
<h3>Recent Improvements in Telegraph Equipment</h3>
<p>— Ye Zhonghua</p>
<p>As the saying goes, "To do a good job, one must first sharpen one's tools." Since our telegraph communication relies primarily on mechanical lines, maintaining them in perfect condition directly impacts work efficiency. The Ministry of Communications has a strict management system for maintaining telegraph equipment and lines, which is generally well-managed. In recent years, further improvements have been sought to increase work efficiency. Recent improvements in mechanical equipment are described below for the readers' benefit:</p>
<p>1.  改造克利特印字機之改造 Creed Printer Modification: The Creed Morse Printer automatically prints formal text from the oiled paper tape (with telegraph symbols) received by the Creed Receiving Perforator through mechanical action. The receiving bureau then delivers a copy to the recipient, making the process exceptionally fast. Most busy bureaus have this equipment to increase the speed of copying incoming messages and to avoid manual errors. Chinese four-character code telegrams are common, but copying numbers on this machine requires using large strokes (i.e., — equals one dot and four strokes, while the usual small strokes, — equals one dot and one stroke) for printing. This consumes more material and time, a major drawback in operation. Recently, Mr. Chen Nianchun of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau's testing laboratory has carefully researched and proposed using seven of the machine's less frequently used symbols (since the symbols for the numbers 4, 5, and 6 do not conflict with Roman letters, they do not need modification) to adapt the machine for small-stroke four-character code telegrams. It is reported that the Ministry of Communications has adopted Mr. Chen's proposal and decided to completely改造 all existing printers for this application. This successful modification will not only save the Ministry of Communications considerable material costs annually but also greatly increase the speed of telegraph transmission. This is truly a memorable achievement.</p>
<p>2.  韋氏收報機與分流凝電器之裝用Installation of Wheatstone Receivers and Shunt Condensers: Overhead telegraph lines, due to the insulation resistance of insulators, often fluctuate with weather conditions. Additionally, since the lines are all installed in parallel, leakage and induction are inevitable during operation. Most important lines in our country are equipped with undulatory receivers to receive incoming messages. However, because these machines have very high sensitivity, irregular symbols are easily detected in poor weather, reducing the efficiency rate. To remedy these shortcomings, the Ministry of Communications has specially installed Wheatstone receivers in bureaus in Beijing, Nanjing, Hankou, Zhengxian, Jiujiang, and Nanchang to reduce the impact of leakage and induction mentioned above. It is reported that the results of the installation have been excellent. Furthermore, the Ministry of Communications has recently installed a shunt condenser on the receivers and auxiliary generators on the busy circuits of Beijing-Shanghai, Beijing-Ping, Beijing-Hankou, Ping-Hankou, Shanghai-Hankou, Shanghai-Ping, and Ping-Tianjin to increase the working speed. The current passing through the receiver's coil inevitably causes a retardation effect, which, at high speeds, often distorts the symbols. The capacity action of the shunt condenser cancels out the retardation effect, thus increasing the working speed. It is reported that since installing shunt condensers on the receivers, the working speed can be increased by more than 10%. (To be continued)</p>
<h3>Television Essays</h3>

<p>The Future of Television - Lord Selsdon</p>
<p>My visit to the United States is to research and investigate the progress of television in that country, to report to the British government on its current state, so that the British Broadcasting Corporation and the British Post Office can decide how to proceed with television transmission. Before opening it to civilian use, we should explore the art of visual broadcasting as much as possible. Although the British Broadcasting Corporation's transmission of films is still in the experimental stage, it has aroused the interest of the British public. The future of television is bright and very clear. However, it is difficult to say when it will be welcomed by the general radio audience.</p>
<p>The Function of Electronic Magnifiers - Dr. R.C. Hergenroter</p>
<p>Excellent images of 300 lines or more can be captured outdoors or indoors, with a light density comparable to that of sound films. The electronic television method has progressed to this point. The recent progress of a new type of cold cathode vacuum tube called an electronic magnifier has greatly increased the sensitivity of television cameras and opened up the efficiency of wireless transmission and reception of television signals. Although television is still in the laboratories of the United States, it will soon be available to the public.</p>

<p>Brief Remarks</p>
<h3>Verdict in the Peach Blossom Tragedy Murder Case</h3>
<p>— Chui</p>
<p>According to a dispatch from Beiping the day before yesterday, the Liu-Teng love triangle murder case was adjudicated yesterday. Su Ming was found not guilty. Liu Jinggui's self-confession was accepted; however, due to the pitiable circumstances, he was sentenced to twelve years of imprisonment according to Article 77 of the Criminal Law. The prosecutor, dissatisfied with the acquittal of Su Ming, decided to appeal. I believe that Liu Jinggui, the murderer, cannot escape the law, while Su, who neither incited nor murdered, is truly innocent. The judge's application of the law must be accurate.</p>
<p>The root cause of this case was that after Su Ming initially engaged with Liu Jinggui, she then fell in love with Teng Shuang and divorced Liu to marry Teng. This caused Liu to become unbearable, leading to the intent to kill Su. However, due to certain circumstances, achieving this was difficult, so she changed her plan and shot and killed her love rival, Teng Shuang, causing Su to lose her object of affection, thus relieving her anger. She then willingly confessed to pay for her crime. This is the truth of the case.</p>
<p>However, under the current legal system, marriage is absolutely free, regardless of the reason for the divorce or how many divorces occur, these can all be ignored. This is because the law originally had no provision for the crime of divorce, so the divorce of Su and Liu is the same as any ordinary divorce, and why should it be a crime? Moreover, Liu's killing of Teng was Liu's own intention. Not only did Su not incite it, but Teng was Su's lover, so Su was even more in a position of harm, so where does Su's crime come from?</p>
<p>In short, let us ask why Liu wanted to kill Teng. Because killing Su was not easy to achieve, she changed her plan and killed her love rival. Let us also ask why Liu wanted to kill Su. Because Su initially used deceptive means to combine with Liu, saying, "From today onwards, you are mine, and I am yours; it doesn't matter if we sleep together." After achieving her goal, she divorced Liu, causing Liu to suffer both reputational damage and physical harm without redress. Thus, the thought of killing Su Ming and Teng Shuang arose. Therefore, in this tragic love triangle murder case, the murderer is indeed Liu Jinggui, but the one who caused this tragedy is actually Su Ming. Moreover, although divorce may be without guilt, the divorcer must be held responsible for the ill effects caused by the divorce. The reasoning is very clear.</p>
<p>The original power of law is based on supporting the upright and eliminating injustice. The occurrence of a case often has a sequential principle and a cause-and-effect relationship. However, modern jurists often abandon the cause and only discuss the result, not asking about the previous circumstances but only discussing the later consequences. It is right that Su Ming is innocent. In short, the law is inanimate, and judges are living people. There is room for discretion in applying the articles, so in the past, there were flexible phrases such as "The law is unforgiving, but the circumstances are excusable," or "The circumstances are excusable, but the law is unforgiving." It all depends on the judge's consideration of the circumstances and weighing the facts, examining the case. If it is said that the current judge can only apply the legal text and is not allowed to decide freely, then the law clearly states that murderers should die. Why did the judge, because the circumstances were pitiable, pardon her death sentence and change it to imprisonment?</p>
<p>This kind of improper sentencing is an obvious fact. I will give another example to illustrate it. Suppose someone, A, is hit by a stray arrow and asks surgeon B to treat him. B takes the arrow that is outside and saws it off, saying, "It is cured." A says, "The arrow is still inside; what do you mean, cured?" B says, "I am a surgeon and can only treat the outside. What is inside the skin and flesh is the job of an internist, not my business." Those who hear it cannot help but laugh. The way the current judge discusses the case, only discussing the result without asking about the cause, is very similar to this.</p>
<h3>Lingfeng Temple</h3>
<p>— Juefu</p>
<p>This is an ancient temple isolated on a hillside. In front of it is a pool of mirror-like lake water, tightly surrounded by elegant plum groves and verdant bamboo. Standing at the foot of the mountain and looking up, one cannot see a single tile or a corner of the wall; what appears before one's eyes is only a large cluster of lush green forest hidden in the mist. Although there is a winding stone path leading up from the foot of the mountain, it is already covered with moss and vines.—Perhaps this is precisely what indicates the unfortunate fate of this ancient temple.</p>
<p>In fact, in this ancient city known for its temples and monasteries, this is perhaps one of the most deserted. Even during the busiest Spring Festival, other places are already like bustling markets, crowded with pilgrims and tourists all day long, while this place still maintains its original solitude, silently hidden in the lush green forest.</p>
<p>However, perhaps precisely because the footsteps of pilgrims and tourists rarely reach this place, the secluded and serene mountain charm is still richly preserved here. If you want to appreciate the flavor of "cicadas chirping, the forest becomes more silent, birds singing, the mountain becomes more secluded," taking a stroll here might give you a sense of it.</p>
<p>Although I only spent half a day in this dilapidated ancient temple, the impression it gave me will never be forgotten from my mind.</p>
<p>It was on a morning after a fresh rain, the morning mist hanging high on the distant and nearby mountain peaks had not yet cleared, and the West Lake hidden under the green willows also seemed to be still fast asleep. I alone stepped onto the stone steps covered with moss and vines, passed through the verdant bamboo forest, and walked straight toward this ancient temple silently standing in the atmosphere of solitude. When I stepped into the ruined hall, a monk with a face full of wrinkles was silently dozing there, sitting upright. The several clay statues on both sides were also silently facing each other with bitter expressions. The entire temple was filled with a gloomy and cold atmosphere. Whether it was the shrine, the Buddha statues, or the incense burners and candle stands, they were all clearly covered with a layer of decay and desolation. Being in this place is like walking into an ancient tomb, causing one to feel a violent tremor!</p>
<p>The dozing monk was probably awakened by the sound of my shoes. He raised his head, rubbed his eyes, and immediately glanced at me in alarm. Although he didn't say anything, looking closely at his surprised gaze, it seemed as if he was saying, "Ah! Why have you come here too?"</p>
<p>After circling the cold temple, I walked into the elegant plum garden next to the temple. Although the plum blossoms had already withered, the old branches were covered with bean-sized plum fruits, which looked quite ancient and interesting. I chose a clean stone under the dense green shade, sat down, and looked at the silver lake water, the towering peaks, and the white clouds hanging on the peaks. At the same time, I listened carefully to the gurgling streams, the clear bird songs, and the rustling sound of the breeze brushing through the forest. My heart, which had been scorched by the smog of the big city for a long time, suddenly felt a sense of leisurely detachment from the world!</p>
<p>I sat silently in the embrace of the green plums and verdant bamboo for two whole hours until the fiery red sun peeked out from the treetops of the lush bamboo. Only then did I quietly and slowly walk down the mountain. When I reached the foot of the mountain and looked back, it still felt as if I had lost something most beloved in that cluster of hidden lush bamboo!</p>
<h3>Change</h3>
<p>— Ling Zixi</p>
<p>It was three years ago, the fields yielded a bit more grain, and Aunt Jin San also earned a few more dollars in Shanghai "helping people." When she returned, she saw Jin San beaming with joy, and she also saw that Ling Meizi, whom they had adopted since she was six, had grown into a fuller figure. "She's already of age," she thought. Taking advantage of the good harvest and the money in hand, she hurriedly brought her silly and clumsy son, Shuangxi, who was learning carpentry in town, back to have them get married; but now, the days are getting worse and worse, and the life in the fields is really hard to "afford." Adding one more person to the family is as heavy as adding a big millstone. Her son Shuangxi spends most of his time working in shops outside, and Aunt Jin San is often "eating other people's rice" outside, leaving Jin San and Ling Meizi alone at home is not very convenient, and besides, Ling Meizi doesn't have any children yet, what's the point of leaving her at home to eat idle rice? For this whole string of reasons, Aunt Jin San decided to take Ling Meizi to Shanghai to "eat other people's rice." Shuangxi is a silly fellow, so naturally he can't say anything, but Ling Meizi has never</p>
<h2>Page 25</h2>
<p>been out of this place before. She doesn't know what the world outside is like. When Aunt Jin San took her away, she even cried.</p>
<p>But Mother A'fa, who had worked in a Shanghai yarn factory for three years, said to Aunt Jin San in person, "Aunt San, if things weren't really so bad, it would be better to let Ling Meizi stay in the countryside. Shanghai is a big dyeing vat, and the little girl isn't a fool. Such a clever child, I'm afraid she won't...?"</p>
<p>But Aunt Jin San had made up her mind very firmly, and she dragged Ling Meizi away in a huff: "What are you gossiping about? The girl is an honest fellow. What are you afraid of when she's by my side! Even if it's a dyeing vat, even if it's a tiger's mouth... Do you think a young girl would just be swallowed up by people when she gets to Shanghai?"</p>
<p>"Gossip? Just wait and see! Who knows what will happen to a young girl in the future? A little girl changes eighteen times, the outside world is big, and there are many patterns! Shanghai, a good place? Heh, it's a big dyeing vat!"</p>
<p>And so, people, like time, drifted far away.</p>
<p>By the time the rice ripened in the second year, the fields were still filled with the unpleasantness and sighs of a poor harvest. But Aunt Jin San brought Ling Meizi back (and secretly sewed the accumulated fifteen silver dollars into the quilt). People were shocked when they saw Ling Meizi; she had completely changed and was unrecognizable. She had cut her hair, put on a short-sleeved robe (although it was made of cloth), and rubber shoes. She had learned to speak Shanghai dialect, learned the way Shanghai women walk (in the countryside, people thought it was a bit "eye-catching"), and also learned to apply inferior snow cream and hate the dimness of the "old Mobil lamp" placed in the center of the table during meals. Finally, looking at Shuangxi's silliness, she simply cursed at the table, and at night, she secretly cried alone in bed—this was something no one knew, and no one could have imagined.</p>
<p>"She is no longer suitable for living in the countryside," everyone in the village thought, except for Shuangxi. Yes, this time when she went back to Shanghai, Ling Meizi already knew how to replace the crying of a year ago with a proud smile.</p>
<p>Just over half a year later, one summer, someone came from Shanghai to the countryside with a message, saying that Aunt Jin San told Jin San to quickly take Shuangxi to Shanghai; "Something happened in Shanghai: Ling Meizi ran away with someone!"</p>
<p>The news shocked the people in the village and Jin San like a thunderbolt! The only one who wasn't surprised was Mother A'fa, who had worked in a Shanghai yarn factory for three years: "I told you, a little girl changes eighteen times, Shanghai is a good place, isn't it?—It's a pretty big dyeing vat!"</p>
<h3>Long Car</h3>
<p>— Written by Zhu Yanghui</p>
<h3>Miss Attar</h3>
<p>— Micro-Vague</p>
<p>From a friend who just returned from abroad, I received candied Attar fruits brought from Southeast Asia. The firm, sweet, and warm fruit slipped through my mouth, and a sweet, harmonious flavor floated from my heart, making me suddenly think of Miss Attar, whom I haven't seen for so long.</p>
<p>Miss Attar grew up in a coconut grove, and it has been a long seven years since I last saw her. Her dark brown face resembled the reddish peel of the Attar fruit, her round cheeks looked like the small size of the Attar fruit, and her solid physique was even more like the flesh of the Attar fruit. What earned her the title "Miss Attar" even more was her gentle temperament, which made people feel a sweet infatuation at first sight.</p>
<p>I met Miss Attar when she was only fourteen years old. However, the scorching climate had already made this girl as mature as a woman. She could sing Malay songs, tell Malay folk tales, and speak fluent Malay that pleased the listeners. Her mother was Javanese, so although her father was a Chinese merchant in the wilderness, she was accustomed to the Malay way of life, immersed in traditional Malay customs.</p>
<p>She often rode bicycles with a group of male friends to play in the jungle, openly and frankly joking and teasing with the men without any reservations. When everyone was having a great time, she would jump into the river with her male friends, bare her upper body, only covering herself with a sarong, and bathe in the middle of the river. Her swimming skills were also quite good. Once, she caught sight of a crocodile in the middle of the river and hurriedly climbed onto the shoulders of a male friend who was a good swimmer, quickly swimming back to shore. Once ashore, she kept shouting:</p>
<p>"I was so scared! I was so scared!"</p>
<p>But then she opened her mouth wide and laughed heartily.</p>
<p>Her father's friends were not satisfied with her, saying:</p>
<p>"Chinese etiquette is being destroyed! This Malay-ized girl, why don't you discipline her?"</p>
<p>However, her father loved her as he loved her mother, saying:</p>
<p>"My daughter is still young!"</p>
<p>And Miss Attar pouted her lips and said:</p>
<p>"Am I only allowed to play with female friends, not male friends? I insist on being a tomboy!"</p>
<p>Yes, her attitude was unusually frank and sincere. She had Javanese blood, but also Chinese blood. She loved every male friend, and every male friend loved her. She didn't show favoritism, didn't fall into romantic love, and wasn't as indulgent in carnal desires as Javanese women. She was still as innocent as a child, although her body was obviously well-developed.</p>
<p>By the time Miss Attar returned after graduating from a Dutch middle school, she was no longer a completely ignorant wild girl. However, her attitude towards people was still the same. Still innocent, funny, and loved to play with male friends; still making everyone who saw her love her, giving everyone a sweet and warm feeling like having eaten candied Attar fruits.</p>
<p>Five years later, Miss Attar was nineteen years old. Once, after returning from vacation from a medical school in Batavia, people noticed that her attitude had completely changed: she didn't smile, didn't play with friends; she lived alone at home, lonely all day long; her round cheeks had also become thin, like dried Attar fruits.</p>
<p>Her friends were all surprised, and her father frowned, running around trying to find out the reason for his daughter's change. Everyone was baffled.</p>
<p>Until one day, Miss Attar received a letter and suddenly announced that she was going to The Hague. Her father had no choice but to obey her without understanding, and her friends all went to the port to see her off on the ship.</p>
<p>Miss Attar opened her mouth and said:</p>
<p>"Men are so unreliable, I must go to The Hague to find him!"</p>
<p>Who was "him"? She didn't say. We could only guess that he was her classmate and lover.</p>
<p>After that, there was no news of Miss Attar. Her friends all sighed for her. It has been seven years, and I had almost forgotten her: today I thought of her because of the Attar fruit; where did this tomboy girl go after losing her love?</p>

<p>The Midnight Music Society at No. 66 Min Village, Min Road, this port, has been actively promoting national music and has been highly praised by people from all walks of life. Therefore, letters and telegrams are pouring in, and there are piles of accumulated cases. In addition to requesting accompaniment for national music singing, many listeners have also urged Mr. Xu Ruhui, the organizer of the society, to lecture on the rhythm and music theory of Midnight Songs. The society, unable to refuse the listeners' enthusiasm, began last Sunday afternoon from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM at the Dunben Radio Station to teach the playing method of the Xiao flute and the motives, meanings, and missions of composing Midnight Weekly Songs in great detail. Recently, a song called "Selling Fried Dough Sticks" has been released, which is novel and moving, and fully equipped with five-line Gongche simplified notation. The cover is painted by Mr. Wu Qishou, with elegant meaning and clear colors. Each copy is sold separately for eight cents, and long-term subscribers receive an 80% discount. A catalog is available, and a sample copy will be sent with a six-cent postage stamp.</p>
<p>Movie News</p>
<h3>Yi Hua Anecdotes</h3>
<p>Yue Feng's new script after "Escape" is in the process of being written, the title has not yet been determined, and the content is full of poetic posture.</p>
<p>Since the re-release of "Escape" at the Central Grand Theater, the box office is the same as when it was released at the Jin Cheng.</p>
<p>When Ying Yunwei's "Hero of the Times" was first presented to the Yi Hua Company's editorial review committee for discussion, everyone present expressed their approval of the script. At that time, Fang Peilin said: "If Lao Ying succeeds in making this play, the praise he will receive will definitely be greater than 'Peach and Plum Tribulation,' I dare to say that."</p>
<p>Everyone admits that Hu Ping's acting skills in "Elegy of Life" have made considerable progress, but Hu Ping's acting skills in Shi Dongshan's sound film "The Beginning of Man" have made even greater progress. In "The Beginning of Man," she plays a woman from youth to old age.</p>
<p>Among Chinese films, the only actress who has played two roles appearing in the same frame is Hu Die in "Sister Flowers." There has been no male actor yet. Now, Wang Yin in "The Beginning of Man" has broken the record. He plays two roles, one is the blacksmith Xiao Gen, and the other is the rich son Jia Ju. At the same time, the two are also arguing with each other. His portrayal of these two roles is as successful as in "Escape."</p>
<p>"The Beginning of Man," which brings together the most outstanding technical talents in the Chinese film industry, is almost entirely completed. Now there are only a few scattered location shots. Yesterday, "The Beginning of Man" went to the Yong'an Yarn Spinning Factory to take work shots of spinning workers, working for five hours in a row. Everyone inhaled a lot of cotton wool from their breath, especially Zhou Ke inhaled the most. After returning, the cotton wool inhaled into the lungs suddenly "felt uneasy in the lungs" and wanted to run out in groups. Therefore, Zhou Ke's sputum in every cough was inevitably mixed with a lot of cotton wool. Seeing this, the big fat Chen Linshu joked, "Zhou Ke will spit out cotton wool."</p>

<h3>Hudson and Land Plane Are All Equipped with All-Steel Car Bodies</h3>
<p>— Yun</p>
<p>It has been said that "all-steel car bodies" have been a much-publicized term for a long time, but in reality, they only exist this year. Because before this year, the so-called "all-steel car bodies" still had a central roof made of lightweight materials. Now, the 1935 Hudson production, including the Land Plane, is worthy of being a truly all-steel car body. The entire structure is made of solid steel without the use of a single piece of wood. Except for the windows, all the floorboards, side panels, front, rear, and roof are made of solid steel. Passengers are surrounded by steel above and below when they are in the car. Therefore, they can enjoy absolute safety with its strict protection.</p>
<p>What is especially commendable is that Hudson and Land Plane's all-steel car bodies are not only safe and reliable, but also exceptionally quiet. All vibration sounds that can reach the eardrum have been suppressed by acoustics experts to eliminate them invisibly. Therefore, its quietness is far superior to all types of car bodies produced before. Hudson's products are more and more loved by people. This beautiful all-steel car body is one of the reasons.</p>
<p>The picture shows the working situation of the Hudson roof center panel welded to the car body as a whole</p>
<h3>The Ordinary Henry Ford</h3>
<p>Living a Carefree and Simple Life</p>
<p>(Written by Macon Pingay of the Detroit Free Press)</p>
<p>Any well-informed Detroiter is most often asked the question: "What kind of person is Henry Ford, really?" I think in my past twenty-five years, people have asked me this question more than any other. People from all walks of life ask this question, especially journalists, engineers, sociologists, historians, and students. These people come to Detroit from all over the world to study Detroit, which is known as the twentieth-century city of the world.</p>
<p>The only answer I can give to these people seeking impossible knowledge is that Mr. Ford is just an ordinary person. What he does today is no different from what he did a long time ago. He set a world record on the ice of St. Clair one Sunday afternoon. His actions today are no different from when he used to eat his lunch on the old truck counter in front of City Hall. His way of thinking is so simple and clear that it bewilders researchers who aim to seek profound and complex things. Henry Ford is still a villager, who likes to "visit" and likes to sit down and elaborate on his opinions. Since he is a naturally ordinary person, he does not think there is anything profound in his own words.</p>
<p>I really think he would rather sit on a wall and chat with other farmers about the harvest than discuss what they consider to be profound and serious issues with the world's great men, because he has never let himself fall into the routine of the world's thought patterns. Therefore, he observes things more clearly. Those in the world who consider themselves learned, how can they know that there is a great difference?</p>
<p>The surprise we most often hear from travelers is that Henry Ford does not have an office. Most people think this is the strangest point about him. But if you ask them why he should have an office, they will all say in unison: "Why do all other executives have offices?" If Mr. Ford also had an office, he would not know what to do. So he eliminated this unnecessary thing. He uses his brain to think instead of an office.</p>
<p>From what I have seen, I can be sure that he likes to be an ordinary person, but the world does not allow him to be so. Sometimes he would rather sneak into a barber shop in Dearborn for a shave and sit down in turn to wait for his turn like other villagers. But he cannot even enjoy this little pleasure. A large crowd of people fill the place, making it impossible. Many years ago, he often went to the barber shop at the Detroit Athletic Club (D.A.C.) in the afternoon, but even there he could not get privacy.</p>
<p>He himself has become a public figure, so he has no privacy to speak of. He must surround himself with various protective measures to live his own life. He is no better than the people he likes to mingle with. If he does not take precautions, then he will not have a minute of free time to do his own things all year round.</p>
<p>His hobbies are as simple as those of ordinary people. He finds pleasure in the small things in life. No one else gets more happiness than him. He is closer to the soil than the average farmer. Any mechanical vibration can quickly get a responsive cry in his blood, just like a young child being enchanted by a mechanical toy for the first time. He feels the same depth of interest in a nesting bird as he does in the fate of a nation. He can see the comparison between the two.</p>
<p>In Henry Ford's eyes, the world is evergreen, so he still retains a young mind.</p>
<h3>Rapidly Advancing British Automotive Industry</h3>
<p>— Yingdai</p>
<p>(1) Vehicle Production Quantity. The automotive industry has now progressed to the fourth position among the heavy industries in England. When we look back, the British automotive industry is only thirty years old. In these short thirty years, the automotive industry in England has progressed from its infancy to its current position. The rapid progress makes us feel surprised. Directly or indirectly, as many as 500,000 workers serve the automotive industry. The development of the automotive industry has not only led to the development of various auxiliary industries, but also important industries such as steel, electricity, rubber, leather, etc., have been able to increase their development power for the automotive industry. Mid-priced cars have become very common in recent years, and current sales continue to increase. This is indeed a major reason for the rapid development of the British automotive industry. By the end of September 1934, British car factories had produced a total of 240,780 vehicles in one year. Compared with the previous year, this is an increase of 20,000 vehicles. Last year's car registrations increased by 24% compared to 1933. But compared to 1932, it actually increased by 50%.</p>
<p>(2) Manufacturing Progress. New British-made passenger cars and trucks have reached a very reliable level of manufacturing. The construction of the components has very few defects to a degree that was unimaginable a few years ago. If we compare the new cars of the early this year with the 1934 model, there have been many improvements. In addition to considerable improvements in appearance, plus comfort, reliability, and lower prices, the new cars have electric lights, electric start, curtain switches, direction indicators, coil ignition, synchronized gears, low-pressure tires, shock absorbers, improved cushions, simple chokes, and safety glass, etc. What is said here is only a small part of the advantages. This progress has also affected government revenue. Although the current British car tax has been reduced, car owners still have to pay 70,000,000 pounds in taxes every year. Due to the increasing number of vehicle registrations, tax revenue has not decreased but has increased. And the government spends most of these taxes on improving roads.</p>
<h2>Page 32</h2>
<p>(3) Increased Exports. British cars have made great progress in manufacturing. We only need to look at the increase in exports in recent years. The increasing credit of overseas countries is clear. Since 1931, the number of British car exports has doubled. Last year, a total of 34,905 household cars were exported, worth 4,855,287 pounds. In 1933, only 33,763 vehicles were exported, worth 4,362,333 pounds. Including car parts and components, the total export value was 11,305,497 pounds. In 1933, it was only 9,373,826 pounds. In the motorcycle industry, Britain is still the leader among all countries, but the number of exports has decreased. This shows that the sales of motorcycles in Britain are more active in the domestic market. The total number of exports was 16,497, worth 648,998 pounds. In 1934, it was 17,725 vehicles, worth 670,416 pounds.</p>
<p>(4) Development of Trucks. In recent years, British car factories have also started to manufacture heavy-duty trucks. Since the adoption of the "Diesel" engine, the development of the truck industry has been promoted due to the engine's power and the increase in load capacity. New four-ton or heavier trucks equipped with "Diesel" engines account for 65%. Especially industrial or agricultural tractors use even more. Trucks in Britain have indeed made rapid progress recently. From October 1933 to August 1934, British car factories manufactured 78,001 trucks, an increase of 19,000 vehicles compared to the previous year. Another particularly interesting thing is that since the beginning of this year, many countries in the world have reduced car horsepower taxes. Some have reduced them by 25%. This can also encourage British car factories to manufacture more high-horsepower cars.</p>
<p>(5) Future Outlook. In the past year, the improvement in British car manufacturing has paid more attention to driving issues. Making the shifting of gears simple and agile has become a common feature. In terms of appearance, the streamlining has also been considerably improved. When the spare tire and luggage are placed in the back, they are completely invisible. At the same time, great attention has been paid to the problem of reducing wind resistance. Under modern civilization, the automobile is a gift obtained by mankind. However, in Britain, due to the road law regulations, it is still subject to various restrictions. As a matter of fact, the future of automobiles requires progress in the hope of improving roads and everything that cars themselves cannot control. The current development of the British automotive industry has made British car factories optimistic about the future. Judging from the current situation, the automotive industry will continue to have the possibility of progress and development in the coming years.</p>
<h3>Safety Devices for Highway Construction</h3>
<p>This picture is a kind of elastic wire mesh, specially used for dangerous places such as corners, embankments, roadbeds, and bridge sides of highways where cars turn. Its function is to stop the car and avoid accidents. The attached circular diagram shows that the car has strayed off the road, but fortunately it was blocked by the net fence, so it was spared the disaster of overturning. The highways of various provinces are either built on mountains or against mountains facing the sea. It is extremely dangerous for cars to travel through bends. Accidents occur from time to time. This protective net can add a layer of safety guarantee for travelers (Shanghai Yangshupu Public Works Iron Factory created domestic protective net)</p>
